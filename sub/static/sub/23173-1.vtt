00:15.790 --> 00:18.959
Humans think they
top the food chain,

00:18.960 --> 00:22.470
but certain creatures
hunt humans for food.

00:23.840 --> 00:28.850
In Tokyo, their existence
has long been acknowledged.

00:28.970 --> 00:33.180
They have come to
be called "ghouls,"

00:33.350 --> 00:36.560
and are regarded as
a lurking threat.

00:38.110 --> 00:42.860
The government-formed
Commission of Counter Ghoul

00:43.030 --> 00:45.780
has exterminated many of them.

00:46.450 --> 00:49.950
However, ghouls continue to exist,

00:50.120 --> 00:53.000
amid the shadows of Tokyo.

01:17.140 --> 01:19.310
Kaneki. Check this out.

01:21.980 --> 01:28.240
Until now, Ward 20's been
relatively free of ghoul activity.

01:28.990 --> 01:30.989
That's pretty close.

01:30.990 --> 01:33.490
Behind the university street.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.370
Ghouls, huh?

01:38.210 --> 01:43.089
You'd get eaten in no time.
You like weird books too.

01:43.090 --> 01:45.009
Try reading sometime.

01:45.010 --> 01:48.880
No way. I'd fall asleep
inside five seconds.

01:49.050 --> 01:50.680
Your egg sandwich.

01:51.350 --> 01:54.350
Hey Hide. Ever seen a ghoul?

01:54.520 --> 01:55.600
Nope.

01:55.890 --> 02:00.230
But I hear they look human.
There could be one close by.

02:10.410 --> 02:12.120
Close by, huh?

02:18.120 --> 02:19.920
What if I was a ghoul?

02:20.170 --> 02:24.040
Dial it down. What if
there is one here?

02:24.630 --> 02:26.010
Hello.

02:29.380 --> 02:30.840
She's here!

02:34.390 --> 02:36.100
Ask her out today.

02:36.270 --> 02:38.810
T-Tomorrow's b-better.

02:38.980 --> 02:39.980
What's better?

02:40.060 --> 02:41.060
It's just better.

02:41.061 --> 02:43.900
Today's just as good. Go for it.

02:44.690 --> 02:46.900
O-Once I finish this book.

02:47.070 --> 02:49.320
Reading's bad for you!

02:49.490 --> 02:51.200
Hide! Stop, dammit!

02:59.330 --> 03:01.080
I-I'm sorry.

03:01.870 --> 03:03.040
Great author.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.510
Sen Takatsuki.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.800
Y-Yeah!

03:32.450 --> 03:35.990
"Egg of the Black Goat"

03:46.340 --> 03:48.710
"Date with Rize"

04:09.190 --> 04:12.489
I like her "Egg of the Black Goat,"

04:12.490 --> 04:15.070
and her debut "Dear Kafka."

04:15.360 --> 04:20.040
That letter trick made me
shout out loud on my own.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.620
And her short story collections.

04:22.790 --> 04:28.249
Like "Monochrome Rainbow," that
inspired "Egg of the Black Goat."

04:28.250 --> 04:30.340
You sure are a big fan.

04:32.260 --> 04:35.179
All this book talk is boring you.

04:35.180 --> 04:40.680
No Kaneki, I just want to
get to know you better.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.820
So do I.

05:05.330 --> 05:06.330
Kaneki?

05:08.580 --> 05:09.580
Here.

05:12.130 --> 05:14.210
You've got meat on you.

05:18.340 --> 05:19.600
Other side!

05:24.020 --> 05:25.230
Sorry!

05:26.560 --> 05:28.310
You're funny, Kaneki.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.110
You're not eating?

05:39.780 --> 05:42.450
I've been overdoing it lately.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.200
Light eater?

05:44.370 --> 05:49.040
I wouldn't say that.
People say I eat too much.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.130
Mean, right?

05:51.290 --> 05:52.710
It is.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.550
Touka, you never eat anything.

06:11.060 --> 06:12.820
You're very quiet.

06:13.770 --> 06:18.030
Yeah. I like walking quietly.

06:32.210 --> 06:33.380
Kaneki?

06:35.960 --> 06:37.130
Yeah?

06:38.260 --> 06:41.550
I... knew.

06:42.680 --> 06:47.520
"That you were always...
watching me."

06:51.230 --> 06:52.770
I was...

06:54.110 --> 06:56.280
...watching you too.

08:06.180 --> 08:09.350
Wow, you taste great!

08:27.450 --> 08:33.000
There's a scene I love in
"Egg of the Black Goat."

08:33.210 --> 08:39.039
When the Black Goat totally rips
out a fleeing man's entrails.

08:42.630 --> 08:48.600
No matter how many times I read
it, it gets my juices flowing.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.280
First time seeing a real ghoul?

09:37.310 --> 09:40.400
Help me! Help me!

09:42.440 --> 09:44.110
Help me!

10:10.090 --> 10:12.930
Wow, what a wonderful scream.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.930
I love it.

10:17.560 --> 10:20.190
Somebody help...

10:36.620 --> 10:37.790
Caught you.

10:42.460 --> 10:48.170
No, not yet! Dead flesh doesn't
taste as good. Hang in there.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.190
Why...

11:06.440 --> 11:07.940
Why me?

11:43.020 --> 11:50.740
"Tokyo Ghoul"

11:55.780 --> 11:57.160
Ken?

11:57.780 --> 11:59.750
You're still up?

12:09.210 --> 12:11.920
What does this say?

12:15.720 --> 12:17.930
You read difficult books.

12:18.350 --> 12:21.680
Dad always read them.

12:27.730 --> 12:28.860
Where?

12:29.020 --> 12:30.190
Here.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.960
She died from overwork.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.750
What a shock.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.720
I'm hungry.

13:08.770 --> 13:10.440
Poor kid.

13:24.700 --> 13:27.710
Don't worry. It all went well.

13:41.510 --> 13:47.390
I felt it was my duty as a doctor
to save the life in front of me.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.440
This guided my decision.

13:49.730 --> 13:51.940
I take full responsibility.

13:52.110 --> 13:56.650
You didn't confirm if she
consented to organ donation.

13:57.400 --> 14:02.700
You can't get away with transplanting
her organs arbitrarily.

14:02.870 --> 14:06.830
As I stated before,
she was already dead

14:06.870 --> 14:12.340
when she was brought in, so we
couldn't confirm her consent.

14:17.510 --> 14:21.800
We came all the way to
Ward 20. What a waste.

14:23.680 --> 14:27.350
Mado, he doesn't have a mask on him.

14:27.890 --> 14:29.270
Amon.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.980
Here.

14:55.840 --> 14:59.470
When you're done, remove
the kagune and kakuhou.

15:00.510 --> 15:03.970
It'll make a fascinating quinque.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.830
Luck's on our side,

15:33.500 --> 15:34.960
Amon.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.799
No. 696, aka Tajima and Serisawa.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.590
Real name Asaki Fueguchi.

15:42.760 --> 15:47.430
Killed a cop in Ward 13.
Came to the 20th a year ago.

15:49.020 --> 15:52.690
The ring he left
behind was order-made.

15:52.940 --> 15:56.650
Two were ordered in different sizes.

15:56.820 --> 15:59.990
The other ring must
belong to his wife.

16:00.280 --> 16:03.320
Not his wife, his breeding mate.

16:03.490 --> 16:05.160
What does she look like?

16:05.320 --> 16:10.910
We checked No. 696's belongings,
but he had no photo of her.

16:11.080 --> 16:15.460
If he'd had one, we wouldn't
be at this meeting.

16:15.630 --> 16:18.920
We'd be out exterminating her.

16:19.090 --> 16:20.670
The only clue is...

16:24.800 --> 16:27.050
...a fiber attached to his t-shirt.

16:34.190 --> 16:35.350
Excuse me.

16:35.730 --> 16:37.980
I'm Ward 20 agent Kusaba.

16:38.060 --> 16:39.770
No need for niceties.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.530
If we assume No. 696
does have a wife,

16:44.900 --> 16:48.370
isn't it a bit hasty to
presume she's a ghoul?

16:54.960 --> 16:56.790
Could you love this?

17:09.099 --> 17:12.930
Precaution is necessary
when dealing with ghouls.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.210
Kaneki!

17:37.040 --> 17:42.210
Here. I took notes for you. Three
weeks worth of Asian History.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.170
Thanks.

17:45.670 --> 17:48.640
Okay, time to celebrate!

17:48.970 --> 17:49.970
Where?

17:50.010 --> 17:51.720
Big Girl!

17:54.180 --> 17:56.100
Here I go!

17:59.650 --> 18:01.060
Yum!

18:02.730 --> 18:03.860
Eat yours.

18:05.400 --> 18:10.700
I wanted to come with you once you
got out. I've been holding off.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.580
Aren't I a good friend?

18:13.080 --> 18:16.040
Your doctor's getting
majorly slammed.

18:17.210 --> 18:20.170
But that girl had no family at all.

18:22.170 --> 18:24.380
She died almost instantly too.

18:25.840 --> 18:30.340
Don't let it get to you.
Eat up and cheer up.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.640
Oh yeah. I just joined a circle.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.730
They plan events and stuff.

18:42.190 --> 18:43.900
If you wanna join...

19:12.840 --> 19:15.220
Kaneki! You okay?

19:15.390 --> 19:16.970
Are you alright?!

19:17.520 --> 19:19.100
I'll get a cloth!

19:23.100 --> 19:25.360
Mr. Ogura, tell us again.

19:25.520 --> 19:31.700
Why is it that ghouls can't
eat food like humans do?

19:34.280 --> 19:38.950
That's because their tongues
work completely differently.

19:39.200 --> 19:45.000
Could you eat the organs of a
living human? You couldn't.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.170
It's the same thing.

19:47.460 --> 19:52.130
Basically, ghouls can only
gain nutrition from humans.

19:53.260 --> 19:57.100
This is said to be due
to a special enzyme.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.850
Normal food tastes terrible to them.

20:01.100 --> 20:05.730
Salads taste acrid,
and meat and fish

20:06.150 --> 20:09.530
are unbearably putrid.
They try to hide it,

20:09.690 --> 20:14.530
and eat them around humans, but
it makes them want to vomit.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.830
You're sounding like a ghoul.

20:17.990 --> 20:23.210
No, I simply know ghouls better
than they know themselves.

23:45.410 --> 23:46.660
Food!

23:48.490 --> 23:51.750
"I smell it! Food! Food!"

24:39.210 --> 24:41.710
Don't scare me like that!

24:42.510 --> 24:44.550
I thought you were human.

24:45.800 --> 24:50.100
What is it? You're hungry?

24:51.600 --> 24:55.899
Don't hold back. He tastes
as bad as he looks,

24:55.900 --> 24:56.900
but food's food.

24:56.940 --> 24:58.020
Wham.

25:11.790 --> 25:14.750
Stay out of others' territory.

25:17.210 --> 25:18.750
Friend of yours?

25:23.550 --> 25:25.680
This is my feeding ground.

25:27.390 --> 25:28.510
Feeding ground?

25:28.680 --> 25:30.010
Hey.

25:36.520 --> 25:41.610
Having my territory violated
really pisses me off.

25:46.570 --> 25:48.490
Whose territory?

25:50.160 --> 25:54.660
Touka? That greedy bitch Rize died.

25:55.080 --> 25:58.790
Until she came, this
was my feeding ground.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.250
Anteiku governs Ward
20 feeding grounds.

26:03.460 --> 26:04.920
"Anteiku"?

26:26.650 --> 26:28.240
Four-eyed asshole.

26:57.020 --> 26:58.600
Want some?

27:05.110 --> 27:07.780
You... I saw you with Rize...

27:12.070 --> 27:13.570
What are you?

27:26.300 --> 27:28.210
I've identified the fiber.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.130
Where's it sold?

27:30.300 --> 27:32.180
Er, well...

27:32.720 --> 27:34.930
It's French in origin,

27:35.180 --> 27:38.640
but I don't know where
it's sold in Japan...

27:44.860 --> 27:46.230
Let's go.

27:47.190 --> 27:49.400
A ghoul killed his parents.

27:50.190 --> 27:52.740
Poor kid. Right in front of him...

27:57.580 --> 27:58.580
Amon.

28:00.450 --> 28:02.670
We'll trace the dress fiber.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.380
Sleeping well?

28:11.630 --> 28:13.680
Let your past haunt you.

28:19.060 --> 28:21.270
It's what makes us strong.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.150
Please help me.

29:10.980 --> 29:12.990
We're closed, sir.

29:13.860 --> 29:14.950
Hey!

29:16.200 --> 29:17.660
I'm begging you.

29:19.910 --> 29:22.500
You're my only hope.

29:23.450 --> 29:24.750
Do you...

29:26.540 --> 29:29.040
...have any food I can eat?

29:29.210 --> 29:33.880
Food you can eat? You know
what that is. Get it yourself.

29:34.380 --> 29:36.880
I just can't do that. Please.

29:37.890 --> 29:39.800
Please, help me.

29:40.720 --> 29:45.770
Ever since I became like this,
my life's a living hell.

29:49.230 --> 29:51.770
I remember the news now.

29:52.150 --> 29:55.650
It was you who received
Rize's organs.

29:57.400 --> 30:02.120
Tell me. What does
this cake taste like?

30:07.540 --> 30:11.380
Or doughnuts? Or tarts?

30:11.960 --> 30:14.260
Chocolate? Orange juice?

30:14.420 --> 30:18.840
Strawberries? Melons?
Pasta? Curry rice?

30:19.090 --> 30:23.390
Tell me. You were
human, weren't you?

30:26.390 --> 30:28.060
That's enough.

30:29.190 --> 30:30.480
Boss?

30:37.190 --> 30:43.450
Helping other ghouls...
is Anteiku policy.

30:55.380 --> 30:59.170
"Anteiku"

31:18.990 --> 31:20.360
Hinami.

31:22.620 --> 31:23.870
I'm sorry.

31:39.010 --> 31:41.550
That's our Anteiku blend.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.390
It's delicious.

32:27.890 --> 32:29.970
Don't cry, dumbass.

32:31.640 --> 32:32.940
I'm sorry.

32:33.810 --> 32:38.650
We ghouls are somehow
able to drink coffee.

32:39.610 --> 32:42.110
It helps to quell our hunger.

32:42.950 --> 32:47.700
But before long, you'll
crave something more.

32:52.870 --> 32:54.330
"We ghouls"?

32:55.830 --> 32:57.460
Thank you.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.510
Much appreciated.

33:21.110 --> 33:23.240
Oh, that reminds me.

33:24.150 --> 33:26.780
Here's some for you too.

33:51.390 --> 33:54.020
The agony of a ghoul's hunger

33:54.980 --> 33:57.980
is incomparable to that of humans.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.030
Kaneki!

35:34.700 --> 35:36.120
You still alive?

35:38.790 --> 35:40.500
I know you're there.

35:44.170 --> 35:45.500
Hey.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.550
"I need a favor at university.
Here's payment. From Hide"

36:57.620 --> 36:58.910
How can I help?

36:59.080 --> 37:01.120
How many have you sold?

37:01.290 --> 37:05.120
Um, seven in the last six months.

37:05.420 --> 37:08.210
We need your security footage.

37:08.790 --> 37:11.960
Did a ghoul really buy clothes here?

37:12.170 --> 37:15.300
Confirming that is our
job as CCG agents.

37:16.680 --> 37:18.390
That's so scary.

37:19.350 --> 37:21.270
Please exterminate it soon.

37:21.930 --> 37:23.600
Yes. We will.

37:25.350 --> 37:28.560
Huh?! An eye infection?

37:29.270 --> 37:31.940
I thought you starved to death.

37:33.240 --> 37:36.200
I'll stick to you like glue today.

37:43.250 --> 37:44.250
What's wrong?

37:47.250 --> 37:50.750
Oh, nothing. So, you wanted a favor?

37:52.250 --> 37:54.670
You've gotta join my circle.

37:55.630 --> 37:57.590
Please dude, I mean it.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.390
We need somebody to organize data.

38:01.010 --> 38:05.890
If I make a miscalculation,
my senior...

38:08.060 --> 38:09.980
...will chew me out!

38:11.900 --> 38:14.570
His name's Nishio. He'll be here.

38:15.240 --> 38:16.399
Coming in!

38:16.400 --> 38:17.610
Oh crap!

38:22.870 --> 38:24.120
What?

38:46.730 --> 38:48.520
Hey Nagachika.

38:49.020 --> 38:52.560
There are two things
I hate. Know them?

38:55.820 --> 38:59.570
Bell peppers and...
shiitake mushrooms?

38:59.950 --> 39:04.200
1: Having my territory violated.

39:04.410 --> 39:08.790
2: Stupid juniors who don't
knock before entering.

39:09.410 --> 39:11.710
- Sorry.
- And shiitake.

39:13.590 --> 39:14.880
Oh yeah!

39:17.340 --> 39:21.300
This is for you. It'll
go with your coffee.

39:21.470 --> 39:22.550
Thank you.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.470
Taiyaki?

39:27.471 --> 39:28.930
Yeah.

39:41.490 --> 39:42.610
Who's he?

39:42.780 --> 39:46.740
He's the friend I told
you about. Kaneki.

39:51.370 --> 39:54.290
How do... you do?

39:55.420 --> 39:59.710
Pharmacy sophomore Nishiki
Nishio. Nice to meet you.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.670
Amon, want to grab a bite?

40:36.840 --> 40:39.380
I know a great noodle place.

40:43.470 --> 40:44.680
Sorry.

40:46.800 --> 40:50.350
So Kaneki, how long have
you known Nagachika?

40:51.640 --> 40:55.520
Since elementary school,
when Hide transferred in.

40:55.690 --> 40:58.400
How come you've stuck together?

40:58.570 --> 41:00.070
He was always shy...

41:00.230 --> 41:01.400
I didn't ask you.

41:02.030 --> 41:03.320
Sorry.

41:03.780 --> 41:08.280
In Year 2, I always sat alone
and read books at recess.

41:08.410 --> 41:11.239
He was the first to talk to me.

41:11.240 --> 41:12.540
We've been friends since.

41:16.210 --> 41:19.040
So, you figured it's time to end it?

41:35.600 --> 41:36.730
Hey, let's go eat.

41:37.020 --> 41:40.480
"Good idea. Let's eat."

41:44.990 --> 41:45.990
Hide!

41:52.990 --> 41:55.160
Man, that was foul.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.120
Like eating horse shit.

41:58.630 --> 42:01.880
You brought him here
to eat him, right?

42:02.340 --> 42:05.340
I mean, how many years
have you waited?

42:06.170 --> 42:08.840
No... You're wrong!

42:09.510 --> 42:12.470
Really? Then I'll have him.

42:14.520 --> 42:15.310
Don't do it!

42:15.480 --> 42:18.190
You should've said that before!

42:23.900 --> 42:28.320
You stink. Just like a female ghoul.

42:31.370 --> 42:33.620
There's always been a rule...

42:35.080 --> 42:38.580
...that food goes to the strongest.

42:51.510 --> 42:52.930
Are you kidding me?

43:59.700 --> 44:01.160
Don't tell me...

44:01.920 --> 44:04.830
...you make friends with food?

44:15.180 --> 44:16.180
Hide...

44:19.060 --> 44:22.560
This guy gives me the creeps.

44:32.780 --> 44:36.070
Go on. Die.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Okay okay! I take
it back! I'm sorry!

46:11.170 --> 46:13.960
Hey! Hey! Calm down, dude!

46:15.550 --> 46:20.800
I wasn't thinking right. I was so
hungry I couldn't help myself.

46:21.470 --> 46:26.730
Rize... Rize stole my feeding
ground, so it's been a month.

46:28.270 --> 46:30.810
You're a ghoul too. You understand.

47:24.830 --> 47:27.000
Hide! Hide!

47:27.370 --> 47:29.620
Hide! Hide!

47:29.750 --> 47:31.830
Hide! Hide!

48:19.460 --> 48:22.010
Mr. Yoshimura sent us for him?

48:42.860 --> 48:44.910
I'm so sick of this.

48:52.910 --> 48:54.250
I'm...

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
Be thankful to Touka and Yomo.

49:01.550 --> 49:03.130
Yomo?

49:05.550 --> 49:07.600
Better watch yourself.

49:07.760 --> 49:12.390
Nishiki's gone, but he could try
to get revenge at any time.

49:21.070 --> 49:25.070
There's only one way for a ghoul

49:25.530 --> 49:27.490
to satisfy their hunger.

49:32.080 --> 49:32.830
Hide...

49:33.000 --> 49:34.080
Relax.

49:36.250 --> 49:37.960
We took him to hospital.

49:38.960 --> 49:41.050
He's still unconscious.

49:44.010 --> 49:45.010
Hide!

49:45.340 --> 49:46.340
Don't go!

49:46.550 --> 49:47.640
But...

49:48.970 --> 49:52.140
Don't go near him ever again.

49:54.140 --> 49:58.900
Hide is... the only friend I've got!

50:02.690 --> 50:07.530
You tried to eat your
friend, didn't you?

50:10.910 --> 50:15.580
I don't understand. I
just don't understand.

50:18.750 --> 50:21.040
What the hell am I?

50:24.050 --> 50:28.380
Kaneki, you're the only one

50:29.430 --> 50:35.060
who can exist in the worlds
of both ghouls and humans.

50:36.230 --> 50:40.770
Come work at Anteiku.

50:41.020 --> 50:43.940
Here, you can learn the
ways of our world.

50:51.820 --> 50:52.949
Found it?

50:52.950 --> 50:58.790
Five women in Ward 20 who
bought that dress wore a ring.

50:58.960 --> 51:00.370
Facial recognition?

51:00.580 --> 51:01.630
In progress.

51:01.790 --> 51:05.130
Isn't this woman's dress too small?

51:05.300 --> 51:07.340
"Size XS"

51:10.970 --> 51:13.640
There might be another one.

51:15.390 --> 51:17.390
A baby rat.

51:24.270 --> 51:27.740
Slowly now. Don't rush it.

51:28.440 --> 51:31.490
Like writing the character "no."

51:38.790 --> 51:40.040
Rush a little.

51:44.750 --> 51:47.000
Hey, you like Sen Takatsuki?

51:51.090 --> 51:52.340
Hinami.

51:59.230 --> 52:00.230
I'm sorry.

52:00.270 --> 52:01.770
No, I am.

52:04.690 --> 52:09.320
Hinami... has no friends.

52:13.110 --> 52:15.070
I can't send her to school.

52:19.370 --> 52:21.080
Thank you.

52:23.710 --> 52:24.830
Hinami.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.050
I can't believe they're ghouls.

52:31.760 --> 52:33.220
What about me?

52:34.260 --> 52:37.600
And Mr. Yoshimura? And Touka?

52:39.220 --> 52:41.230
We all look like ghouls?

52:41.770 --> 52:42.770
No.

52:43.900 --> 52:47.110
Okay then, what about her?

52:49.820 --> 52:51.240
Is she human?

52:51.900 --> 52:53.110
I'm afraid not.

52:53.860 --> 52:58.410
"That person, and that
person, and that person,"

52:59.700 --> 53:02.290
and everyone else here are ghouls.

53:05.080 --> 53:09.130
This cafe's like a sanctuary
for ghouls in Ward 20.

53:09.300 --> 53:12.670
But you get human
customers too, right?

53:13.880 --> 53:17.089
To survive in the human world,

53:17.090 --> 53:20.100
we need to study them up close.

53:22.100 --> 53:25.020
Anyway, I like them.

53:26.400 --> 53:27.480
Humans.

53:28.520 --> 53:34.280
But... to survive, you have to...

53:49.630 --> 53:51.750
Er, Yomo?

53:54.090 --> 53:56.760
What are we doing out here?

54:07.190 --> 54:08.560
Hold this.

54:09.310 --> 54:10.310
Okay.

54:15.240 --> 54:18.160
Few people know about this place

54:18.240 --> 54:19.950
because we clear it.

54:24.250 --> 54:29.250
The people at Anteiku
use suicide victims...

54:29.920 --> 54:32.750
...as ...food?

54:32.960 --> 54:36.380
You think ghouls like
the Fueguchis can hunt?

55:07.000 --> 55:08.249
Hello.

55:08.250 --> 55:09.580
Hell...

55:10.710 --> 55:12.170
Yoriko?

55:15.420 --> 55:17.050
Why are you here?

55:23.390 --> 55:24.970
Here.

55:30.350 --> 55:32.270
I made this for you.

55:32.440 --> 55:34.860
Wow. It looks delicious.

55:35.650 --> 55:36.650
Try some.

55:37.860 --> 55:41.240
I'm working now, but I will later.

55:44.740 --> 55:46.370
Right.

55:48.500 --> 55:49.500
Sorry.

56:29.120 --> 56:30.120
It's yummy!

56:30.200 --> 56:31.210
I know!

56:31.410 --> 56:34.250
What's in this? A secret ingredient?

56:34.670 --> 56:36.090
Oyster sauce!

56:36.340 --> 56:38.300
Of course. I thought so.

56:38.460 --> 56:40.800
Try the meat too!

56:46.300 --> 56:49.310
That looks tasty.
Can I try some too?

56:49.640 --> 56:51.430
Like hell you can.

56:52.230 --> 56:54.690
Get coffee beans from upstairs.

57:45.820 --> 57:48.950
Hinami, can I come in?

57:59.880 --> 58:02.380
Sorry I startled you.

58:03.090 --> 58:05.170
I wasn't expecting you.

58:09.680 --> 58:13.270
This really is wrong, isn't it?

58:55.220 --> 58:57.850
Stay down! Stay down!

59:05.110 --> 59:08.530
For the last month, new
doves have been hovering.

59:10.030 --> 59:11.320
"Doves"?

59:12.280 --> 59:15.950
From CCG. Commission of
Counter Ghoul agents.

59:16.660 --> 59:21.880
Seems they came from HQ to hunt
your late husband, and you two.

59:22.630 --> 59:23.840
Then...

59:25.500 --> 59:27.670
My husband was killed by...

59:30.470 --> 59:32.640
Let's shelter them here.

59:34.350 --> 59:39.310
Until we find you a new home,
you must not leave here.

59:41.560 --> 59:45.020
To be safe, we'll take
shifts staying here.

59:45.190 --> 59:48.490
Yomo, you find them a new home.

59:48.650 --> 59:51.360
I know somewhere in Ward 24.

59:51.530 --> 59:54.579
Ward 24? That hellhole?

59:54.580 --> 59:57.580
Doves can't enter there easily.

59:58.950 --> 01:00:03.290
I'll be fine. As long
as I'm with Mom.

01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:11.760
Um...

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.640
Is there anything I can do to help?

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:35.700
Quit acting suspiciously.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:41.750
What?

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:44.420
Er, nothing.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.850
Uta?

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:11.070
Uta?

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:36.390
Hello Touka.

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:48.900
You've got an odd scent.

01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:51.150
Name's Kaneki. He was human...

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.610
Mr. Yoshimura told me.

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.660
Sit here. I'll measure your size.

01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:58.280
My s-size?

01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:01.790
Got allergies? Like
to rubber, or metal.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:04.750
N-Not r-really...

01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:10.250
It'll be your first, so better
a half mask than a full one.

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:11.420
Mask?

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.130
I'll take this off.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.970
You're hungry.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.980
Want one of these?

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:36.860
No, I-I'm fine for now...

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:38.910
Yeah? You're missing out.

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:52.380
Um, excuse me.

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:54.630
What am I here for exactly?

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.670
They didn't tell you?

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:02.680
I'm making your ghoul face.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.100
One of the five seems suspicious.

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:12.060
Security cameras picked her up
after No. 696 came to Ward 20.

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:18.530
But she hasn't appeared for a month
since No. 696 was exterminated.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.860
She bought the small dress.

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:22.699
Last sighting?

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.370
Shirakami Park entrance.

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.249
The day after Asaki Fueguchi died.

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:29.250
It's midnight, so it's murky.

01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:30.960
Midnight?

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.710
Enlarge this.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.840
Clearer.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.060
Amon, do you see it too?

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.850
I do.

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:53.730
Wait a minute. Please explain.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:57.780
Ghouls have learned our
movements in the last month.

01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:00.360
This raises two possibilities.

01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:03.990
They'll come to kill us,
or leave this ward.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.870
If they come to kill us,
luck's on our side.

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:13.580
We won't be so lucky
if they try to leave.

01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:15.420
I need an explanation.

01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:19.760
What are those fatherless
ghouls thinking,

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.840
and what will they do if they leave?

01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:27.930
Before they leave this ward,

01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:34.610
they'll mourn the father again.

01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:44.320
Hinami?

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:54.630
Hesse? You read difficult books.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.670
I read that a long time ago.
I couldn't understand a lot.

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:03.550
My mom's really tired.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.770
If you want, I could
help you with it.

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.980
"The bird fights its
way out of the egg.

01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:21.740
"The egg is the world.

01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:27.070
Who would be born must
first destroy a world."

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.450
What does it mean?

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:33.910
Wait a second.

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:45.090
Think of frying an egg.

01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:49.810
If you want to fry it and
eat it, you have to...

01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:53.930
...break the shell, right?

01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:56.850
If you want something,

01:05:57.690 --> 01:06:02.610
I guess you have to move forward
without fear of getting hurt.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.860
I'd have to eat an
egg to understand.

01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:11.120
Oh yeah. Sorry.

01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:17.750
Okay. It's late, so let's
pick this up tomorrow.

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:26.970
Goodnight.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.940
Kaneki...

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:45.070
I need to ask another favor.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.570
What is it? I'll help if I can.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.950
Take me to my dad's grave.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.080
I can't. The doves...

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.330
It's not like a human's.

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:03.000
After all,

01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:09.470
when ghouls die, the CCG takes
them all away somewhere.

01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:12.050
But... What if they...

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.100
Kaneki, please.

01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:21.310
Before we leave this ward, at
least let me give my father this.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:32.570
My dad loved the
coffee at this cafe.

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.240
Alright.

01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:43.960
How about I place these on
your dad's grave for you?

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:47.010
The doves don't know my face.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.300
Okay?

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:10.170
Amon? Kusaba here.

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:18.720
An eyepatch?

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.600
He wore it over his left eye.

01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:23.020
What's buried here?

01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:24.600
You want to dig it up?!

01:09:24.729 --> 01:09:26.229
Get your hands dirty!

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:29.729
Or go back to HQ and shuffle papers.

01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:33.240
Morality can't destroy evil.

01:09:33.609 --> 01:09:38.160
"In this world, we are
justice. We are morality."

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.180
I'll help you.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.510
Now we know.

01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:43.270
How do you read this?

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.140
Well, this is...

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.150
Hey.

01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:54.820
Oh, this is "shuu."

01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:56.110
"Shuu"?

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.150
It means "sudden rain."

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.740
Yeah, it does.

01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:02.870
You couldn't read it either.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.080
Quit laughing!

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:12.420
I'm truly grateful
for all you've done.

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:16.170
When you're settled,
come back for coffee.

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.840
I will. Definitely.

01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:26.020
Hinami?

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.640
See you again.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.270
Alright, we'll be going.

01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:37.610
Please thank everyone else for me.

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:10.349
Mr. Yoshimura, what kind
of place is Ward 24?

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:15.610
The last resort for ghouls
with nowhere else to go.

01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:26.450
Kaneki. Take these to them.

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:36.630
Oh dear! Hey.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.340
Are you alright?

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.130
It's "shuu."

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.299
"Shuu"?

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:49.100
Sudden rain. Kaneki taught me.

01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:52.560
He knows a lot.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.150
I hope we can see
everyone again sometime.

01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:59.360
Me too.

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.410
We will.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.740
Do you have a minute?

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.900
It's true that my husband and I

01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:41.030
took many lives to survive.

01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:46.070
But this child has only
eaten what we've given her.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:50.370
Please, don't punish her!

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:57.670
What a talkative rat.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.170
Hinami, run.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.430
But...

01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:07.340
I'll be fine.

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:34.160
Hinami?

01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:35.790
Mom's in danger!

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:43.050
Mom!

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.050
Hinami!

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:57.060
A moving display of motherly love.

01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:02.980
How revolting.

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.070
Kaneki, help her!

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:28.880
Don't...

01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:31.970
Please.

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:34.890
Anything but that!

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.860
Any last words?

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:27.020
Hinami...

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:33.660
Li...

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.000
Mommy!

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.210
I'm sorry.

01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:29.920
It's my fault this happened.

01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:35.760
We'll take care of
Hinami here for now.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.310
There were only two.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:49.570
If they're killed in Ward 20,

01:17:50.610 --> 01:17:53.650
they'll send in more
doves. To kill Hinami.

01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:55.200
I'll protect her.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.410
And who'll protect you?

01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:18.930
I'm starving.

01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.030
Amon.

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:40.700
If only the girl's left,
leave the rest to us.

01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:43.580
You two can return to HQ.

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:46.540
She's young, but still dangerous.

01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:51.000
Plus, there's the eyepatch wearer.

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:52.500
Another ghoul?

01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:55.670
Only you've seen him, Kusaba.

01:18:57.010 --> 01:18:59.970
From tomorrow, you come with us.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.400
With you, huh?

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:24.120
Actually, when you and Mado
were first sent here from HQ,

01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:29.040
I considered asking for a transfer.

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:30.670
Desk work's safer.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.340
But I changed my mind
after watching you.

01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:39.720
Because of the way you risk
your lives to pursue justice.

01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:46.770
Man, I'm stuffed.

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.690
Maybe I ate too much.

01:19:50.730 --> 01:19:55.820
Their shrimp tempura is the
best! It's fried to order.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.900
You prefer noodles?

01:19:58.070 --> 01:20:00.570
It's the quickest option.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:07.910
Oh, of course. Better to take
time investigating than eating.

01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:10.670
I'll try it next time.

01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:14.290
Shrimp tempura.

01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:20.170
Amon!

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.220
Kusaba!

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:11.890
Amon... Watch and learn.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:43.470
When faced with an enemy, even
if you're mutilated, fight!

01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:48.600
That's what a pro does,

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.810
Amon.

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.870
Touka?

01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:57.370
Touka! Huh?! Don't tell me you...

01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:00.000
- Butt out.
- No! You need treatment!

01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:02.000
If you won't...

01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:06.630
...go and kill them.

01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:08.800
Can you?

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.890
You can't.

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:24.440
A murderer like me deserves to die.

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:26.190
But...

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:31.910
Ghouls like Ryoko and
Hinami being slaughtered...

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.040
...is wrong.

01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:41.080
I...

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:50.300
I don't want you...

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.390
...to die.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:56.450
A hunger for vengeance
becomes all-consuming.

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:58.200
Let it go.

01:24:58.740 --> 01:24:59.740
But...

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.370
Attacking a dove...

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.840
meant she was ready to
accept all consequences.

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:10.590
That's a fact.

01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:16.050
When Touka heals,
she'll do it again.

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:20.770
You said Anteiku helps other ghouls.

01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:26.150
So, you want to go up
against hundreds of agents

01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:30.820
with the few ghouls we
have here at Anteiku?

01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:37.530
I'm sure everything you've told
me is the truth, Mr. Yoshimura.

01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:44.000
I'm sure you've seen many
things that I never have.

01:25:45.170 --> 01:25:46.380
Even so...

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:51.260
I don't know about attacking agents,

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:55.300
or the rules of the ghoul world.

01:25:57.260 --> 01:26:03.180
So, I want to see with my own
eyes, and make up my own mind.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.160
Mr. Yoshimura told me,

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.120
that you'd be here.

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.380
Touka.

01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:34.840
Teach me how to fight.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.230
I hate being... no use to anyone.

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.100
Touka...

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:51.610
Hey! Wait a minute!

01:26:57.450 --> 01:26:59.530
Sure, I'll teach you.

01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:04.950
Touka... Touka...

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.090
But I only know one way.

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:27.270
We ghouls heal quickly
from fractures.

01:27:32.610 --> 01:27:34.610
So don't fear them.

01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:39.630
Sorry Touka! Are you okay?

01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:48.810
This world is wrong.

01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:53.310
We have to make it right.

01:29:08.370 --> 01:29:09.790
Your kagune.

01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:13.080
Not bad.

01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:22.420
I gave it an eyepatch to suit you.

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.260
It's... on the wrong side.

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:33.480
I wanted to see the
eye you're hiding.

01:29:35.150 --> 01:29:36.980
I'm ready.

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:41.150
They have a sharp sense of smell.

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:46.070
If we set bait, they'll come.

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.410
And if we're lucky,
that rabbit will too.

01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:52.370
You'll really go alone?

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.830
I want you to patrol the area.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:00.550
A third or fourth
ghoul might appear.

01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:02.340
Got it.

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:08.760
Now then... It's time
to take center stage,

01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:12.470
Amon.

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:12.990
Hinami?

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:23.550
That scent...

01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:28.380
Hinami.

01:31:34.810 --> 01:31:36.230
Mom?!

01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:09.470
Mom...

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.390
You're slow! I'll go ahead!

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.570
Amon,

01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:36.790
I've snagged a baby rat.

01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:39.250
I'm on my way.

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:39.350
You'll make a splendid addition.

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:14.190
I can't let you leave.

01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:36.390
No!

01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:42.030
It's about time you let her know.

01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:46.820
Well? Look familiar?

01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:00.210
Say hi to Mommy.

01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:03.170
Why kill Kusaba?

01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:09.800
This world is wrong. You're
the ones deforming it.

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.020
What Rabbit did...

01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:27.110
...was wrong, I know.

01:39:28.110 --> 01:39:31.660
Then again... I can't believe...

01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:36.200
...that you're right.

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:43.920
More people... should
know... about us...

01:42:25.670 --> 01:42:27.330
Pathetic.

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:32.920
Why does your kind want to
live a life built on sin?

01:42:45.810 --> 01:42:49.270
What's wrong with wanting to live?

01:42:50.150 --> 01:42:54.400
We are what we are,
but we were born.

01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:56.910
We were raised.

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.870
Humans are our only food!

01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:07.330
How are we supposed to live
right in bodies like these?

01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:13.710
Monsters like your kind...

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:18.720
...are sinners for wanting to live!

01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:30.690
Any last words?

01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:55.170
Hinami...

01:43:56.050 --> 01:43:58.340
Don't treat us this way!

01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:02.470
Magnificent!

01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:06.850
It's simply magnificent!

01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:17.030
Hinami!

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:20.360
End this!

01:44:23.410 --> 01:44:26.240
I'll make a quinque out of you!

01:44:29.370 --> 01:44:31.920
My very own quinque...

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:36.380
Families should...

01:44:38.130 --> 01:44:40.680
...be together, shouldn't they?

01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:50.730
He's the man... who
killed your parents!

01:44:55.690 --> 01:44:57.610
Killing him...

01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:04.200
...won't bring them back!

01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:13.680
No...

01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:18.140
Don't...

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:22.520
Don't make me into a killer!

01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:58.980
If this world...

01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:02.600
...is what people like you...

01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:06.650
...believe in...

01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:10.820
...then this world...

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.240
...is wrong!

01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:02.010
Hey, do I...

01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:07.440
Do I deserve to live?

01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:11.980
I... hurt someone.

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:19.700
Hinami.

01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:25.620
I think your mom was
trying to tell you to...

01:51:27.670 --> 01:51:29.170
"Live."

01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:32.710
I'm sure of that.

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:41.050
Let's go home.

01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:13.630
Local residents have been warned.

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:19.629
A dismembered body found recently

01:52:19.630 --> 01:52:23.890
is now believed to be that
of a ghoul investigator.

01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:29.190
As there were no bite marks,

01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:31.770
the motive appears to
have been revenge.

01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:44.070
Read for me again?

01:53:24.490 --> 01:53:26.370
Don't cry, dumbass.

01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:34.980

01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:38.980
