00:01.521 --> 00:05.023
===MUTANT X Crossroads Of The Soul / s02.ep07===

00:09.209 --> 00:10.410
I GOT A WICKED DEAL.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.012
'78 CAMARO,
45,000 ORIGINAL MILES.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.613
GUY WANTED FIFTEEN G'S.

00:13.613 --> 00:15.215
I GOT HIM DOWN TO THIRTEEN-FIVE.

00:15.215 --> 00:16.416
HMM.

00:16.416 --> 00:17.617
THREE-FIFTY LT-1 ENGINE?

00:17.617 --> 00:19.219
YEAH, BABY, THE REAL DEAL.

00:19.219 --> 00:21.221
BOOK SAYS
THERE'S ONLY A THOUSAND
OF THEM IN EXISTENCE,

00:21.221 --> 00:22.422
AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM.

00:22.422 --> 00:24.824
EVEN CAME WITH ITS OWN
DANCING HULA GIRL ON THE DASH.

00:28.828 --> 00:30.830
YEAH, BRENNAN, AS HAPPY AS
WE ARE YOU'VE MANAGED TO SAVE A

00:30.830 --> 00:32.832
HUNK OF METAL FROM THE SCRAP
HEAP, THE REST OF US HAVE SPENT

00:33.233 --> 00:35.235
THE LAST TWELVE HOURS DOWN AT
THE DOCKS TRYING TO TRACK DOWN

00:35.235 --> 00:36.836
A SHIPMENT OF
STOLEN MEDICAL SUPPLIES.

00:36.836 --> 00:39.239
I GUESS THAT MEANS
YOU DIDN'T FIND IT.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.241
DON'T EVEN START.

00:43.243 --> 00:44.844
ALL RIGHT, GUYS. YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:45.245 --> 00:46.846
THIS STORM'S COMING IN PRETTY
HARD AND MY CONNECTION'S GOING

00:46.846 --> 00:48.848
BAD ANYWAY, SO I'LL CALL
YOU WHEN I GET CLOSER TO TOWN.

00:48.848 --> 00:50.850
CONNECTION'S GOING?

00:50.850 --> 00:52.052
PLEASE.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.854
AND HE USED TO BE A CON MAN?

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:36.896 --> 01:39.699
GUESS IT WASN'T SUCH
A GOOD DEAL AFTER ALL.

02:21.741 --> 02:23.343
I AM ADAM KANE.

02:23.343 --> 02:26.146
I WAS A PIONEER
OF GENETIC RESEARCH,

02:26.146 --> 02:29.349
MANIPULATING DNA
TO SAVE HUMAN LIVES.

02:29.349 --> 02:35.355
BUT IN MANY THEIR
GENES UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED

02:35.755 --> 02:38.158
AND DEVELOPED
SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES.

03:04.584 --> 03:06.986
TOGETHER WITH FOUR OF THE MOST
POWERFUL I FIGHT TO PROTECT A

03:07.387 --> 03:09.789
WORLD THAT DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW WE EXIST.

03:13.393 --> 03:14.594
WE ARE...

03:14.594 --> 03:16.996
MUTANT X.

03:20.166 --> 03:26.573
SHH... SHH... IT'S OKAY.

03:26.573 --> 03:30.577
UHHH... UHHH.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.979
SHH. SHH, DON'T TALK.

03:33.379 --> 03:37.784
I'LL MAKE IT ALL BETTER...

03:48.194 --> 03:50.597
YOU KNOW, IF THESE GUYS ARE
PLANNING ON SHIPPING THE STOLEN

03:50.597 --> 03:54.200
EQUIPMENT OUT OF THE PORT, THEY
GOTTA BE HIDING IT SOME PLACE.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.403
YEAH, LIKE ANY ONE OF,
OH MAYBE, A THOUSAND RUN-DOWN

03:57.403 --> 03:59.806
WAREHOUSES THAT WE'LL
NEVER HAVE TIME TO SEARCH.

04:00.206 --> 04:01.808
SOMEONE ON THE STREET MUST KNOW.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.810
IT'S AN UNDERCOVER JOB.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.011
NO, IT'S A BRENNAN JOB,

04:05.011 --> 04:07.013
AND HE'S OFF SCREWING
AROUND WITH HIS HOTROD.

04:07.013 --> 04:09.015
LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET AN ETA.

04:09.015 --> 04:16.623
BRENNAN. BRENNAN, DO YOU COPY?

04:17.023 --> 04:19.425
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.427
I MEAN, HE SAID THAT THERE
WAS A STORM COMING AND WHO KNOWS

04:21.427 --> 04:23.830
WHAT KIND OF CONDITION
THAT CAR WAS IN.

04:23.830 --> 04:26.232
OKAY.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.435
CAN WE TALK SOME MORE
LIKELY SCENARIOS FOR A SECOND.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.838
WHITE TRASH CAMARO...

04:32.238 --> 04:35.041
BRENNAN...

04:35.041 --> 04:37.443
MAYBE A SMALL-TOWN WAITRESS WITH
A TASTE FOR BOTH OF THE ABOVE?

04:37.443 --> 04:40.246
IF YOU ASK ME, HE'S PROBABLY
JUST SHACKED UP IN A NO-TELL

04:40.246 --> 04:45.051
MOTEL USING HIS, "I THINK
WE HAVE SOME ELECTRICITY
BETWEEN US" LINE.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.653
NO.

04:46.653 --> 04:49.055
NO, IF SOMETHING HELD HIM UP
THEN HE WOULD'VE CONTACTED US.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.457
WELL, I'LL KEEP A TRACE RUNNING.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.059
IF HIS COMLINK'S PUTTING
OUT ANYTHING AT ALL WE SHOULD BE

04:53.059 --> 04:55.461
ABLE TO FIND HIM.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.677
THERE WAS... AN ACCIDENT.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.278
THIS TRUCK WAS
HEADING TOWARDS MY CAR.

05:12.278 --> 05:13.880
SHH. IT'S OKAY.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.481
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

05:15.481 --> 05:19.085
THANKS FOR TAKING
CARE OF ME LIKE THIS.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.087
MY NAME IS MIRANDA.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.489
BRENNAN MULWRAY.

05:29.095 --> 05:32.298
DID YOU PUT
MY CLOTHES SOMEWHERE?

05:32.298 --> 05:34.300
THEY WERE RUINED IN THE STORM.

05:34.300 --> 05:39.105
BUT, I HAVE OTHERS FOR YOU.

05:39.105 --> 05:41.107
THANKS.

05:41.107 --> 05:45.111
AND I FOUND THIS IN YOUR POCKET.

05:52.318 --> 05:53.519
UM...

05:59.125 --> 06:00.326
THERE.

06:00.326 --> 06:02.328
BRENNAN LAST CHECKED IN AT 9:18.

06:02.328 --> 06:05.932
HE WAS... HERE.

06:05.932 --> 06:08.334
THIRTY MILES
OUTSIDE OF EDGARSTOWN.

06:08.735 --> 06:11.137
SO IF HE HAD CAR TROUBLES
OR HAD TO GET IN FROM THE STORM,

06:11.537 --> 06:13.539
I FIGURE THAT'S WHERE
HE WOULD'VE WOUND UP.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.342
YEAH,
BUT A STORM DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHY HIS COMLINK DIDN'T WORK.

06:16.342 --> 06:17.944
I SAY WE GO FIND HIM.

06:18.344 --> 06:21.147
WHY DON'T YOU GRAB EMMA,
GRAB SHALIMAR, GET ON THE ROAD?

06:21.147 --> 06:22.749
I THINK YOU'LL WANT
TO RETRACE HIS ROUTE ALL

06:23.149 --> 06:26.753
THE WAY DOWN INTO EDGARSTOWN.

06:28.354 --> 06:32.358
ADAM. ADAM.

06:32.358 --> 06:35.561
HEY, JESS, CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?

06:43.569 --> 06:46.773
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW IF YOUR DAD'S STYLE
QUITE WORKS FOR ME, BUT...

06:46.773 --> 06:48.374
HERE IT IS.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.376
I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT.

06:50.376 --> 06:52.779
NOW, I JUST HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE AND

06:52.779 --> 06:54.781
HOW COME I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU AROUND BEFORE.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.183
YEAH, WELL, I TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT FROM AROUND HERE.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.585
I KNOW WHAT YOU
SAID, BUT YOU'RE WRONG.

06:59.986 --> 07:03.589
LOOK, MIRANDA, THERE'S
PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE

07:03.589 --> 07:07.193
WORRIED ABOUT ME SO IS THERE
A PHONE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE?

07:07.193 --> 07:08.394
A PHONE.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.396
UM, I THINK THERE'S
ONE AT BRADY'S STORE.

07:10.396 --> 07:11.998
WANT TO GO?

07:11.998 --> 07:15.601

07:24.010 --> 07:25.611

A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OVER

08:25.271 --> 08:27.273

08:55.301 --> 08:58.104
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

08:58.504 --> 09:00.506
TOWN'S REAL FRIENDLY, THOUGH.

09:00.506 --> 09:04.510

09:04.911 --> 09:06.913

09:55.361 --> 09:58.164

10:12.578 --> 10:15.781
GERALD GILBERT AND HIS
BOYS LIVE ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.184
THEY HAVEN'T
BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.785
OKAY, SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL THEM WHO I REALLY AM?

10:19.785 --> 10:20.987
I COULDN'T.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.789
I WOULDN'T WANT THEM
TO THINK THAT YOU WERE CRAZY.

10:23.789 --> 10:24.991
I'M OUTTA HERE.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.993
LISTEN, I KNOW THAT YOU
THINK THAT YOU'RE NOT FROM HERE,

10:27.393 --> 10:28.594
BUT THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.397
PEOPLE CAN'T GO BEYOND THE WALL.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.399
WHAT WALL?

10:33.399 --> 10:34.600
ON EIGHTH STREET.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.803
IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD.

10:47.013 --> 10:51.417
WAIT! STOP!

10:53.019 --> 10:55.021
BEN!

11:03.029 --> 11:05.431
OHHH!

11:11.037 --> 11:12.238
MY POWER'S NOT WORKING.

11:12.238 --> 11:14.640
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:15.041 --> 11:17.043
TRYING TO GET OUT OF HERE.

11:17.443 --> 11:18.244
WHY?

11:18.244 --> 11:19.445
WE'RE HAPPY HERE.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.447
BRENNAN, NO!

11:21.447 --> 11:23.449
HUH... UH...

11:23.449 --> 11:25.851
AGHHH!

11:27.853 --> 11:29.455
NOW YOU KNOW?

11:29.855 --> 11:31.457
NOW YOU BELIEVE ME?

11:31.857 --> 11:33.459
THERE'S ONLY NEW HOPE.

11:33.459 --> 11:36.262
THERE'S ONLY
YOU AND ME -- TOGETHER.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.406
COME AWAY FROM IT.

11:47.406 --> 11:49.008
THERE'S NOTHING
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

11:49.008 --> 11:50.209
BRENNAN, IT'S THE END.

11:50.609 --> 11:51.811
NO, IT'S NOT.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.412
IT'S A FORCE FIELD, OR...

11:53.412 --> 11:55.014
I DON'T KNOW.

11:55.014 --> 11:58.217
THERE'S GOTTA BE A...

11:58.217 --> 12:01.020
SOME KIND OF PROJECTION
FROM THE INSIDE,

12:01.020 --> 12:02.621
BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T SEE ANYTHING...

12:02.621 --> 12:04.623
CARS, OR PLANES, NOTHING.

12:04.623 --> 12:07.426
TELL YOU WHAT,
IF I HAD MY POWERS I'D
JUST BLAST A HOLE THROUGH.

12:07.426 --> 12:08.627
YOU'D SEE FOR YOURSELF.

12:09.028 --> 12:09.829
POWERS?

12:09.829 --> 12:11.831
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:11.831 --> 12:13.833
THIS BARRIER
IS NOT NATURAL, OKAY?

12:13.833 --> 12:15.835
SOMEBODY PUT IT HERE
TO KEEP THIS TOWN INSIDE.

12:15.835 --> 12:17.436
DON'T SAY THAT.

12:17.436 --> 12:19.038
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN HERE.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.639
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.241
WHY DO I HAVE TO BELIEVE, HUH?

12:22.641 --> 12:23.442
I HAVE A LIFE OUT THERE.

12:23.843 --> 12:25.444
I HAVE FRIENDS THAT
I WANT TO GET BACK TO.

12:25.444 --> 12:27.446
I'M GETTING OUT OF THIS TOWN.

12:27.446 --> 12:28.647
WAIT!

12:33.853 --> 12:35.855
MIRANDA.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.456
I WASN'T YELLING AT YOU.

12:37.456 --> 12:41.460
I'M FRUSTRATED, OKAY?

12:47.867 --> 12:50.669
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU CRY.

12:50.669 --> 12:53.072
COME ON.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.875
I JUST REALLY
NEED YOU TO BELIEVE.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.677
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DISAPPEAR.

12:58.677 --> 13:02.281
LOOK AT ME.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.689
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

13:11.090 --> 13:15.494
NOT FOR NOW, ANYWAY.

13:21.100 --> 13:24.303
JOSH, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE AT THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.

13:24.703 --> 13:25.905
WELL, WE GOT
SOMETHING TO DO FIRST.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.506
COME ON.

13:27.506 --> 13:31.510

THE COFFEE SHOP, THE MOTEL...

13:41.921 --> 13:45.524
WELL, IT'S A STRAIGHT SHOT ON
ROUTE 17 FROM EDGARSTOWN TO US.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.526
HE HAD TO COME THROUGH
HERE AND HE HAD TO HAVE STOPPED.

13:47.927 --> 13:51.530
WELL, HE DIDN'T JUST DISAPPEAR.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.737
MAYBE HE STOPPED FOR PARTS.

13:58.737 --> 13:59.939
ALL RIGHT.

13:59.939 --> 14:01.540

14:01.540 --> 14:03.542
WE'LL HEAD TO THE
POLICE STATION I MEAN,

14:03.542 --> 14:05.945
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO HAVE SEEN HIM.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.347
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE.

14:15.554 --> 14:16.755
HO, HO.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.357
WHOA.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.759
NEED TO TALK TO YOU, OLD MAN.

14:20.759 --> 14:23.162
YOU'RE A MARCUS, AREN'T YOU?

14:23.562 --> 14:25.164
YOU HAVE THAT LOOK.

14:25.164 --> 14:27.166
WELL, YOU'RE LOOKING AT
THE FUTURE HEAD OF TOWN COUNCIL.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.168
THAT SO?

14:29.168 --> 14:32.371
I HAD A FEELING THIS TOWN WAS
HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

14:32.771 --> 14:33.973
I GUESS THERE'S PROOF.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.174
HEY, HEY!

14:35.574 --> 14:37.576
YOU SOUND LIKE A MAN
WHO'S FORGOTTEN HOW TO BELIEVE.

14:37.576 --> 14:38.777
THAT CAN BE DANGEROUS.

14:39.178 --> 14:41.180
I BELIEVE
THE IDEALS YOUR GRANDFATHER
FOUNDED THIS PLACE ON.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.582
ALL THAT'S LEFT
NOW ARE THE WORDS.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.184
WELL, YOU'D DO WELL TO
LISTEN TO THOSE WORDS, OLD MAN,

14:45.584 --> 14:48.387
AND KEEP YOUR SON OUT
OF TOWN AND AWAY FROM MIRANDA,

14:48.387 --> 14:49.588
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

14:49.588 --> 14:51.190
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:51.590 --> 14:55.194
MY SONS HAVEN'T
BEEN IN TOWN IN YEARS.

14:55.194 --> 14:59.198
IS THAT BEN?
-YES.

14:59.598 --> 15:04.003
WHY? WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH US?

15:04.003 --> 15:06.805
WELL, WE'LL BE BACK TO DISCUSS
THAT WITH YOU, MR. GILBERT.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.407
YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.809
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

15:15.614 --> 15:17.616
LOOK, HAVE THERE BEEN ANY
ACCIDENTS REPORTED IN THE LAST

15:18.017 --> 15:19.618
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
INVOLVING A CAMARO?

15:19.618 --> 15:21.220
NOT... NOT A ONE.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.622
WELL, OUR FRIEND'S DISAPPEARED
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HERE AND

15:23.622 --> 15:25.224
THIRTY MILES WEST ON ROUTE 17.

15:25.624 --> 15:26.825
YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?

15:26.825 --> 15:28.427
LOOK. I GOT WORK TO DO.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.628
I'M ALONE HERE.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.031
SORRY, I CAN'T HELP YOU.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.638
WE'RE ALL THE SAME HERE.

15:39.638 --> 15:40.839
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT.

15:40.839 --> 15:42.841
YEAH?

15:42.841 --> 15:44.843
MAYBE HERE.

15:44.843 --> 15:47.646
SO WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, ANYWAY?

15:47.646 --> 15:49.648
IT'S NICE.

15:49.648 --> 15:52.451
THERE'S TIME FOR LYING
IN THE SUN, FOR WALKING,

15:52.451 --> 15:55.654
FOR BEING WITH FRIENDS.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.656
ESPECIALLY THE
ONES THAT YOU LOVE.

15:58.057 --> 16:02.061
HMM...

16:02.061 --> 16:04.463
WELL, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
NEW HOPE IS BECOMING MORE

16:04.463 --> 16:06.865
APPEALING BY THE MINUTE.

16:06.865 --> 16:08.867
I KNEW YOU'D LOVE IT... BEN.

16:13.272 --> 16:17.676
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITHOUT ME?

16:21.280 --> 16:22.481
OH, IF I DIDN'T
HAVE MY LIFE OUT THERE,

16:22.881 --> 16:24.483
I COULD SEE SETTLING
DOWN IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.485
YOU MEAN IT?

16:26.485 --> 16:28.487
YEAH, IT DEFINITELY
HAS ITS CHARMS.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.889
WELL, THEN, I'LL LET
YOU IN ON A LITTLE SECRET.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.491
REALLY?

16:32.491 --> 16:34.893
I HALF BELIEVE YOU
ARE WHAT YOU SAY YOU ARE,

16:34.893 --> 16:39.698
AN OUTSIDER, BUT
SINCE YOU DON'T EXIST,

16:39.698 --> 16:48.107
THEN THAT MEANS
I'M IN LOVE WITH AN ANGEL.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.915
I WISH WE AT LEAST
HAD A LICENSE PLACE TO TRACE.

16:56.915 --> 16:58.517
HE DIDN'T LEAVE
US MUCH TO GO ON.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.125
THIS IS IT.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.527
OH, MY GOD.

17:19.338 --> 17:23.342
LOOKS LIKE THIS TRUCK
DIDN'T DO TOO WELL, EITHER.

17:32.951 --> 17:34.953
NICE.

17:34.953 --> 17:37.356
EDGARSTOWN TRUCKING
AND JUNK YARD.

17:37.356 --> 17:40.959
THE TRUCK IS THEIRS.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.764
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING,

17:45.764 --> 17:48.967
I THINK I COULD ACTUALLY
GET USED TO STAYING HERE.

17:53.772 --> 17:56.175
HEY! MIRANDA!

17:56.175 --> 17:57.376
JOSH...

17:57.376 --> 17:58.577
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:58.977 --> 17:59.778
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

18:00.179 --> 18:01.380
YOU ARE.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.382
WELL, IF YOU GOT SOMETHING TO
SAY, THEN WHY DON'T YOU SAY IT?

18:03.382 --> 18:07.386
YOU KNOW, THERE
ARE SOME THINGS THAT DON'T
ADD UP ABOUT YOU, BEN.

18:07.386 --> 18:10.589
I'M GONNA FIGURE YOU
OUT, AND WHEN I DO, MIRANDA AND

18:10.589 --> 18:12.591
EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS COMMUNITY
IS GOING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

18:12.591 --> 18:14.193
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO TO US.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.195
I'M NOT TRYING TO DO
ANYTHING TO THIS COMMUNITY.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.798
NOW, AS FOR MIRANDA, I'M
STARTING TO LOSE PATIENCE WITH

18:19.798 --> 18:22.201
HAVING TO TELL YOU THAT
SHE DECIDES WHO SHE'S WITH.

18:22.601 --> 18:25.003
WELL, MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME.

18:25.804 --> 18:27.806
BEN!

18:28.607 --> 18:30.609
JOSH!

18:33.011 --> 18:35.013
STOP IT!

18:41.420 --> 18:45.424
THIS IS NOT OVER.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.229
YOU'RE HURT.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.430
IT'S NOTHING.

18:51.430 --> 18:52.631
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:53.031 --> 18:55.033
HERE, COME INSIDE.

19:01.440 --> 19:05.844
YOU WERE BRAVE OUT
THERE, FIGHTING FOR ME.

19:05.844 --> 19:10.249
YEAH, YOU'RE WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.055
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

19:17.055 --> 19:19.458
LIKE BRAND NEW.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.034
SEE, I TOLD YOU NEW
HOPE WOULD GROW ON YOU.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.436
YEAH, I MUST HAVE.

20:04.436 --> 20:07.239
I'D LIKE TO TAKE
YOU TO MY WORLD SO YOU CAN
SEE WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.

20:07.239 --> 20:09.241
I'M NOT MISSING ANYTHING.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.643
AND WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT YOUR WORLD, ANYWAY?

20:11.643 --> 20:13.645
OH, EVERYTHING.

20:14.046 --> 20:20.052
THAI FOOD AND DANCE
CLUBS, OCEANS, CARS...

20:20.452 --> 20:24.456
IF YOU COULD
JUST SEE THAT LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

20:24.456 --> 20:29.261
WELL, I STILL THINK
YOU'D BE HAPPY HERE WITH ME.

20:29.661 --> 20:34.866
WELL, SINCE
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.478
HEY.

20:46.478 --> 20:48.480
ZANDER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:48.480 --> 20:50.482
I... I'VE... I'VE
COME TO SEE YOUR FRIEND.

20:50.882 --> 20:52.484
THERE ISN'T
ANY TROUBLE, IS THERE?

20:52.884 --> 20:54.486
NO, NO, THERE'S NO TROUBLE.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.088
I JUST...

20:56.088 --> 20:58.090
WANT TO TALK TO HIM IS ALL.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.691
CAN WE HAVE A MINUTE?

21:00.092 --> 21:01.293
WELL, I'M KIND OF BUSY, BUT...

21:01.293 --> 21:04.896
YEAH.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.902
IT'S ABOUT THE
WORLD OUTSIDE THE WALL.

21:10.902 --> 21:13.305
I KNOW.

21:13.305 --> 21:16.108
YOU'RE PART OF THIS WHOLE THING,
SO WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.510
WELL, IF I'D WANTED TO HURT
YOU, I WOULDN'T HAVE COME ALONE.

21:18.510 --> 21:21.313
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.

21:21.313 --> 21:24.116
COME WITH ME.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.918
PLEASE?

21:28.520 --> 21:30.122
ALL RIGHT.

21:35.327 --> 21:36.928
LOOK, MIRANDA, I'M
GOING TO BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.731
I'M GONNA GO WITH ZANDER, OKAY?

21:45.737 --> 21:46.938
COME ON...

21:46.938 --> 21:48.140
NO, YOU'RE NOT GETTING
A BREAK UNTIL YOU'RE FINISHED.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.741
HEY.

21:49.741 --> 21:51.343
WE FOUND OUR FRIEND'S CAR.

21:51.743 --> 21:53.345
FOUND THAT, AND
THE TRUCK THAT HIT HIM.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.347
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

21:55.347 --> 21:56.948
YOU'RE LYING.

21:56.948 --> 22:00.152
IT WAS MY HUSBAND'S TRUCK.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.355
IT HAPPENED OVER BY
WHERE LEWISTON USED TO BE.

22:03.755 --> 22:06.558
THAT WHOLE AREA SPOOKS ME.

22:06.558 --> 22:07.359
YEAH?

22:07.759 --> 22:08.960
WHY'S THAT?

22:08.960 --> 22:10.962
IT'S JUST A
STORY THAT FOLKS TELL,

22:10.962 --> 22:12.964
BUT I KNOW THERE'S TRUTH TO IT.

22:12.964 --> 22:14.566
WELL, IT USED TO BE
AN ABANDONED MINING TOWN.

22:14.966 --> 22:16.968
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T REMEMBER
SEEING ANY TOWN THERE.

22:16.968 --> 22:18.570
EXACTLY.

22:18.570 --> 22:19.771
ONE DAY THE WHOLE PLACE JUST...

22:20.172 --> 22:22.174
DISAPPEARED.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.377
JUST LIKE BRENNAN.

22:25.377 --> 22:27.379
YOU KNOW, YOU BETTER
BE TELLING US THE TRUTH.

22:27.779 --> 22:30.182
BECAUSE IF OUR FRIEND
DOESN'T SHOW UP SOON...

22:30.582 --> 22:34.986
I'M COMING BACK
FOR YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.393
I FOUND THESE A FEW YEARS BACK.

22:41.393 --> 22:45.797
THAT'S
WHEN I KNEW THAT EVERYTHING
THE ELDERS TOLD US WAS A LIE.

22:45.797 --> 22:49.801
SEE?

22:49.801 --> 22:52.204
HERE ARE THESE PICTURES.

22:52.604 --> 22:55.407
ALL DIFFERENT PLACES, AND...

22:55.807 --> 22:59.811
AND PEOPLE WITH
STRANGE COSTUMES IN THEM.

22:59.811 --> 23:03.415
SEE, WHEN I SAW THOSE MARKS
ON YOUR ARM, THAT'S WHEN I KNEW

23:03.415 --> 23:06.618
YOU WERE FROM OUT THERE,
THAT THESE PLACES WERE REAL.

23:07.018 --> 23:09.421
I'VE DREAMT ABOUT
THESE PLACES FOR YEARS.

23:09.421 --> 23:13.024
MAYBE IT'S CRAZY,
BUT I EVEN DREAMED THAT
I COULD GO OUT THERE MYSELF.

23:13.024 --> 23:17.429
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT, ZANDER, YOU GET ME
OUT OF THIS TOWN, YOU CAN.

23:17.429 --> 23:21.032
THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD
OUT THERE FOR YOU TO EXPLORE.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.441
COUNCIL FINDS OUT ABOUT
YOU, YOU MIGHT DISAPPEAR.

23:29.441 --> 23:30.642
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:30.642 --> 23:33.044
MIRANDA TALKED ABOUT
PEOPLE DISAPPEARING.

23:33.445 --> 23:39.050
I SOMETIMES HAVE
TO TAKE PEOPLE TO COUNCIL
WHEN THEY'VE LOST THEIR WAY.

23:39.050 --> 23:41.052
YOU KNOW, DIDN'T
BELIEVE, OR EVEN WORSE,

23:41.052 --> 23:43.054
SPOKE OUT AGAINST THE TOWN CODE.

23:43.054 --> 23:45.056
NOW COUNCIL CLAIMS THEY'VE
DISAPPEARED, BUT I KNOW BETTER.

23:45.457 --> 23:47.859
THEY TOLD THEM THE WAY OUT OF
TOWN WAS THROUGH THE BASEMENT.

23:47.859 --> 23:49.861
BUT THERE'S NO WAY OUT.

23:49.861 --> 23:52.264
THEY JUST WALKED INTO THE
BASEMENT OF THE TOWN HALL AND

23:52.264 --> 23:53.865
NEVER CAME OUT.

23:53.865 --> 23:55.867
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:55.867 --> 23:57.469
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S DOWN THERE,

23:57.469 --> 23:59.070
BUT I GOT A LOOK ONE TIME.

23:59.070 --> 24:01.072
IT'S... IT'S...
IT'S ALL METAL AND...

24:01.473 --> 24:03.475
AND LIGHTS, AND GLASS...

24:03.875 --> 24:05.877
WELL, THAT'S GOTTA
BE THE FORCE FIELD GENERATOR.

24:05.877 --> 24:09.080
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:09.080 --> 24:10.682
WE GOTTA FIND A WAY OUT OF HERE.

24:10.682 --> 24:12.684
THERE'S GOTTA BE A
WAY TO STOP THAT FORCE FIELD.

24:12.684 --> 24:14.286
WELL, THERE ARE
OTHER PEOPLE WE CAN TRUST,

24:14.686 --> 24:15.887
PEOPLE WHO THINK LIKE ME.

24:15.887 --> 24:17.489
ONE OF THEM
MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.

24:17.489 --> 24:18.690
YOU WAIT HERE.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.092
I'LL BE BACK.

24:30.702 --> 24:33.505
WONDER IF I MIGHT HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU, ZANDER.

24:33.505 --> 24:37.108
THAT IS,
OF COURSE, UNLESS YOU'RE
HERE ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

24:37.509 --> 24:40.312
HUH, WHAT IS IT?

24:40.312 --> 24:41.913
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE A PEACEKEEPER.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.316
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
UPHOLD TOWN COUNCIL'S WILL.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.718
I DO.

24:47.118 --> 24:53.124
YOU'RE HELPING THE OUTSIDER.

24:53.124 --> 24:55.527
EVERYTHING THEY
TOLD US WAS A LIE, JOSH.

24:55.927 --> 24:57.529
WE CAN GET OUTSIDE THE WALL.

24:57.529 --> 24:58.730
HE'S GOING TO HELP US.

24:58.730 --> 25:00.332
I'LL GET THE OTHERS.

25:11.943 --> 25:13.545
WE NEED ANSWERS, ADAM.

25:13.945 --> 25:15.146
WELL, I'VE FOUND SOME,

25:15.146 --> 25:17.949
BUT RIGHT NOW THEY
DON'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.

25:17.949 --> 25:19.150
TRY US.

25:19.150 --> 25:21.553
WELL, ALBERT MARCUS,
IS A WALKING CONTRADICTION.

25:21.553 --> 25:25.557
HE WAS A SCIENTIST
BUT HE HATED MODERN SOCIETY.

25:25.557 --> 25:29.160
NOW, HIS DREAM WAS TO CREATE
A SELF-SUFFICIENT COMMUNITY

25:29.160 --> 25:33.565
THAT WAS FREE OF THE NEGATIVE
INFLUENCES OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

25:33.565 --> 25:35.567
YOU CAN'T JUST DECIDE
TO NOT BE INFLUENCED.

25:35.567 --> 25:36.768
WELL, NOW, WAIT.

25:37.168 --> 25:38.370
MAYBE YOU CAN.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.372
SEE, ONE OF THE PROJECTS
HE WAS WORKING ON WAS A...

25:40.772 --> 25:41.973
IT'S KIND OF
AN ELECTRONIC BUBBLE.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.776
IT WAS AN IMPENETRABLE
FORCE FIELD THAT HE COULD PLACE

25:44.776 --> 25:46.778
OVER AN ENTIRE TOWN.

25:46.778 --> 25:48.780
OH, I DON'T LIKE
THE SOUNDS OF THIS.

25:48.780 --> 25:52.384
SO THIS TOWN THAT ALFRED
MARCUS HAD HIS EYE ON WAS WHAT?

25:52.384 --> 25:54.786
THIRTY MILES WEST OF EDGARSTOWN?

25:54.786 --> 25:56.788
EXACTLY.

25:56.788 --> 25:58.790
LEWISTON.

25:58.790 --> 26:01.192
THAT'S RIGHT AROUND
WHERE BRENNAN DISAPPEARED.

26:01.593 --> 26:04.796
WE'RE ON IT, ADAM.

26:15.206 --> 26:16.808
ZANDER'S DEAD.

26:16.808 --> 26:19.210
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:19.210 --> 26:23.615
BEN GILBERT KILLED ZANDER.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.216
HE MURDERED HIM WITH HIS KNIFE.

26:25.216 --> 26:27.218
I SAW THE WHOLE
THING WITH MY OWN EYES.

26:27.218 --> 26:28.820
NO.

26:29.220 --> 26:32.424
ZANDER WAS GOING TO
TURN HIM IN TO TOWN COUNCIL.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.226
HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

26:35.226 --> 26:36.828
I TOLD YOU I SAW IT.

26:36.828 --> 26:42.834
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM, DO YOU?

26:47.238 --> 26:48.440
OKAY, HEY...

26:48.440 --> 26:50.041
MIRANDA, LISTEN.

26:50.041 --> 26:51.242
HEY.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.244
NOW THEY'RE GOING TO
WANT TO TALK TO YOU, OKAY,

26:53.244 --> 26:55.647
BECAUSE YOU WERE WITH HIM.

26:56.047 --> 26:58.450
BUT I CAN PROTECT
YOU, ALL RIGHT?

26:58.850 --> 27:02.854
YOU JUST HAVE
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

27:02.854 --> 27:09.260
OKAY? -OKAY.

27:30.882 --> 27:34.886
THIS IS RIGHT AROUND WHERE THE
LEWISTON TOWN LIMITS WOULD BE.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.087
CRUISE AROUND,
SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND.

27:38.089 --> 27:42.494
BRENNAN? BRENNAN?

27:42.494 --> 27:44.496
BRENNAN.

27:44.896 --> 27:47.298
YEAH. YEAH, I'M UP HERE.

27:47.298 --> 27:49.701
THE WHOLE TOWN'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.

27:49.701 --> 27:52.103
IT'S NOT SAFE HERE.

27:59.310 --> 28:00.912
WHERE WE GOING?

28:00.912 --> 28:02.113
DON'T WORRY. JUST COME WITH ME.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.916
WHAT?
-COME WITH ME.

28:05.316 --> 28:08.520
MIRANDA, COME HERE.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.522
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
KILLED ZANDER, BRENNAN.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.723
HE WOULDN'T HAVE HURT YOU.

28:11.723 --> 28:12.924
WHAT?

28:12.924 --> 28:14.526
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.127
TAKE HIM.

28:46.558 --> 28:50.562
YOU MADE YOURSELF
A BIG MISTAKE... BEN.

28:50.962 --> 28:52.163
PICK HIM UP.

28:52.163 --> 28:54.566
LET'S GO.

28:57.769 --> 29:01.773
MIRANDA! MIRANDA!

29:01.773 --> 29:04.576
MIRANDA!

29:15.353 --> 29:18.156
LET'S PROCEED.

29:18.156 --> 29:20.959
BEN GILBERT, YOU ARE CHARGED
WITH A CRIME NEVER BEFORE SEEN

29:20.959 --> 29:23.361
IN NEW HOPE, THE
MURDER OF ANOTHER PERSON.

29:23.361 --> 29:26.965
OUR BELOVED ZANDER DELASSANDRO.

29:26.965 --> 29:29.768
ZANDER WAS TRYING TO HELP ME,
SO WHY WOULD I WANT TO KILL HIM?

29:30.168 --> 29:32.971
THIS IS YOUR KNIFE, IS IT NOT?

29:33.371 --> 29:35.774
YES.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.776
OH WAIT, NO, NO, NO.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.377
SOMEONE TOOK THAT FROM ME!

29:39.377 --> 29:41.379
SOMEONE'S TRYING TO SET ME UP.

29:41.379 --> 29:44.983
GERALD.

29:44.983 --> 29:51.790
APPRECIATE YOU COMING DOWN.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.792
YEAH.

29:54.192 --> 29:55.794
SO, WE'LL MAKE THIS QUICK.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.596
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN?

29:58.997 --> 30:02.600
THAT'S MY SON, BEN.

30:03.001 --> 30:05.403
WHAT?

30:05.403 --> 30:07.806
THAT'S NOT THE TRUTH.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.407
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

30:09.407 --> 30:11.009
LISTEN TO ME, THAT IS NOT TRUE.

30:11.409 --> 30:13.411
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS
MAN BEFORE IN MY LIFE!

30:13.411 --> 30:15.013
ENOUGH!

30:15.013 --> 30:18.216
WE'LL RECONVENE IN FIVE MINUTES.

30:18.216 --> 30:19.818
LISTEN TO ME.

30:19.818 --> 30:23.021
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

30:28.626 --> 30:31.029
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING, GERALD.

30:31.029 --> 30:36.234
JUST LEAVE MY FAMILY ALONE.

30:37.435 --> 30:38.636
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

30:38.636 --> 30:39.838
HEY...

30:40.238 --> 30:46.644
REMEMBER, OLD
MAN, OUR DAY'S COMING.

30:49.447 --> 30:51.449
YOU ASK ME, THAT LADY AT THE
JUNK YARD WAS HOLDING OUT ON US.

30:51.449 --> 30:53.051
NO, SHE WASN'T.

30:53.451 --> 30:54.652
TRUST ME.

30:54.652 --> 30:57.055
WELL, HE COULDN'T HAVE
JUST DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR,

30:57.455 --> 30:58.656
COULD HE?

31:02.660 --> 31:05.463
MAYBE THE AIR'S
NOT SO THIN AFTER ALL.

31:17.475 --> 31:19.878
UH... UGH!

31:20.678 --> 31:23.081
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

31:23.481 --> 31:25.083
I'D SAY THAT'S ADAM'S BUBBLE.

31:25.083 --> 31:27.085
THE SATELLITE IMAGERY THAT
I'M PICKING UP OVER THE AREA

31:27.485 --> 31:30.288
IS DISTORTED BY
A POWERFUL ENERGY FIELD.

31:30.288 --> 31:31.489
WE KNOW.

31:31.489 --> 31:33.892
SHALIMAR JUST HIT THE GLASS
CEILING TRYING TO FIND A WAY IN.

31:34.292 --> 31:36.694
SO I GUESS SOMEWHERE IN
THERE IS ALFRED MARCUS'S LITTLE

31:36.694 --> 31:38.696
SLICE OF HEAVEN.

31:38.696 --> 31:40.698
BRENNAN MUST'VE FOUND A WAY IN.

31:41.099 --> 31:43.902
WELL, THEN WE GOTTA
FIND A WAY TO GET HIM OUT.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.904
YOU GUYS STAY RIGHT THERE.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.706
I THINK I MIGHT'VE
JUST FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO CRACK THROUGH THE SHIELD.

31:48.706 --> 31:50.708
I'M ON MY WAY.

31:50.708 --> 31:51.910
COPY THAT, ADAM.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.113
WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE.

31:55.113 --> 31:57.916
WE CAN'T ABANDON EVERYTHING
BECAUSE OF ONE OUTSIDER.

31:58.316 --> 32:00.718
WE MUST ENSURE HARMONY.

32:00.718 --> 32:03.922
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.924
PERHAPS.

32:05.924 --> 32:09.928
BUT HOW MANY
TIMES DO WE HAVE TO KILL THE
TRUTH BEFORE IT STAYS DEAD?

32:09.928 --> 32:15.133
BEN GILBERT, BECAUSE YOU FAILED
TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY AND

32:15.133 --> 32:19.137
REMORSE FOR THE MURDER OF
ZANDER DELASSANDRO AND CHOSE TO

32:19.537 --> 32:23.942
HIDE BEHIND LIES AND FANTASY,
BLASPHEMING THE FOUNDATIONS OF

32:23.942 --> 32:28.346
NEW HOPE, WE HAVE NO
CHOICE BUT TO FIND YOU GUILTY.

32:28.346 --> 32:35.153
THEREFORE, ON THIS DAY,
YOU WILL BE PUT TO DEATH IN TOWN

32:35.153 --> 32:42.760
SQUARE, IN FRONT
OF THE ASSEMBLED CITIZENS.

32:46.764 --> 32:49.968
HUH...!

33:09.187 --> 33:10.388
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

33:10.388 --> 33:11.990
I DIDN'T KILL ZANDER!

33:11.990 --> 33:13.591
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME!

33:13.591 --> 33:15.593
YOU'RE ABOUT TO TAKE
YOUR LAST BREATH, MR. GILBERT.

33:15.593 --> 33:16.794
MAKE IT A GOOD SHOW.

33:16.794 --> 33:17.996
MY NAME'S NOT BEN GILBERT.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.197
IT'S NOT BEN GILBERT!

33:19.597 --> 33:20.798
IT'S BRENNAN MULWRAY.

33:21.199 --> 33:23.201
IN A FEW MINUTES,
IT WON'T MATTER WHAT
THE HELL YOUR NAME IS.

33:23.201 --> 33:24.402
I DIDN'T DO IT!

33:24.402 --> 33:25.603
YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO ME!

33:25.603 --> 33:26.804
I DIDN'T DO IT!

33:26.804 --> 33:28.406
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

33:28.806 --> 33:30.008
MY NAME'S NOT BEN GILBERT.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.410
I DIDN'T DO IT!

33:34.412 --> 33:35.613
HEY, ADAM?

33:35.613 --> 33:36.814
ALMOST READY WITH THE PAYLOAD.

33:38.416 --> 33:40.018
NOW, THE NIGHT THAT BRENNAN
DISAPPEARED, I FOUND OUT THAT

33:40.418 --> 33:42.820
THERE WAS A LIGHTNING STORM
THAT MAY HAVE DESTABILIZED THE

33:42.820 --> 33:45.223
DOME LONG ENOUGH
FOR HIM TO SLIP THROUGH.

33:45.223 --> 33:47.225
YEAH, WE CAN'T EXACTLY
WAIT FOR ANOTHER STORM.

33:47.225 --> 33:49.227
NO, EXACTLY, WHICH IS WHY WE'RE
GOING TO GIVE MOTHER NATURE

33:49.227 --> 33:51.629
A LITTLE HELPING HAND
BY SEEDING THE AREA WITH THIS

33:51.629 --> 33:55.233
SUPERCHARGED SILVER IODIDE.

33:55.233 --> 33:56.834
IF THERE'S ANY
ELECTRICITY IN THE AIR,

33:56.834 --> 34:00.438
THAT STUFF IS
GOING TO MAKE IT SIZZLE.

34:00.438 --> 34:02.840
WE'RE ON TARGET
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

34:03.241 --> 34:06.444
LET'S BEGIN THE SEEDING.

34:13.251 --> 34:15.253
YOU CAN KILL ME
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP
THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT.

34:15.253 --> 34:17.655
ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU THINK
DISAPPEARED WERE MURDERED BY

34:17.655 --> 34:19.657
THE TOWN COUNCIL BECAUSE
THEY CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.

34:19.657 --> 34:22.860
YOU DID A GOOD THING,
TURNING HIM IN, MIRANDA.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.462
YOU'RE ONE OF US.

34:24.462 --> 34:26.864
WE ALL DID WHAT WE HAD TO DO.

34:26.864 --> 34:28.466
YOU DID THE HARD PART, RIGHT?

34:28.466 --> 34:30.068
KILLING ZANDER.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.268
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

34:31.668 --> 34:32.870
JOSH SAID THAT YOU DID.

34:32.870 --> 34:34.072
WELL, HE'S LYING.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.273
IT WAS HIM.

34:35.273 --> 34:36.474
HE SAID ZANDER DESERVED IT.

34:36.474 --> 34:37.275
WHIP THE HORSES!

34:37.675 --> 34:38.876
DO IT!

34:38.876 --> 34:40.078
HAH!

34:40.478 --> 34:41.679
HAH!

34:41.679 --> 34:43.281
MIRANDA!

34:43.281 --> 34:44.482
AH...!

34:44.482 --> 34:45.683
THIS STOPS NOW!

34:45.683 --> 34:46.884
YOU KILLED ZANDER!

34:46.884 --> 34:47.685
LET HIM GO!

34:47.685 --> 34:48.886
HE'S INNOCENT!

34:48.886 --> 34:51.289
LET HIM GO!

34:51.289 --> 34:52.090
AGGHH!

34:52.489 --> 34:53.291
AGGHH!

34:53.291 --> 34:54.492
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:54.492 --> 34:56.094
ENDING THIS HERE AND NOW.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.496
LOOK... LOOK, LET HIM DOWN.

34:58.496 --> 35:00.898
PUT HIM DOWN.

35:00.898 --> 35:03.701
PUT HIM DOWN!

35:04.102 --> 35:07.305
GET ME OUT OF THIS...

35:07.305 --> 35:09.707
THE OUTSIDER IS NOT MY SON!

35:09.707 --> 35:12.910
HE'S THE ONE TELLING THE TRUTH.

35:12.910 --> 35:14.912
THIS PLACE HAS BECOME A PRISON.

35:14.912 --> 35:17.715
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BECOME.

35:24.922 --> 35:28.526
UH!

35:28.526 --> 35:37.335
OH... THANKS.

35:38.536 --> 35:40.538
AGH...!

35:44.142 --> 35:45.343
LET'S GO.

35:45.343 --> 35:47.745
COME ON, LET'S GO!

36:00.258 --> 36:02.660
YOU TOOK A BIG
CHANCE HELPING ME BACK THERE.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.861
I DID WHAT WAS RIGHT.

36:04.262 --> 36:05.863
YEAH, WELL, MOST PEOPLE
WOULD'VE HELPED THEMSELVES.

36:05.863 --> 36:07.865
YOU WOULD'VE
DONE THE SAME FOR ME.

36:07.865 --> 36:09.467
I KNOW IT.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.869
BRENNAN, WE CAN'T.

36:11.869 --> 36:14.272
THERE'S NOWHERE
ELSE TO GO, OKAY?

36:14.272 --> 36:17.875
WE NEED TO TRY
AND STOP THIS THING.

36:18.676 --> 36:19.877
MIRANDA!

36:19.877 --> 36:21.078
MIRANDA!

36:21.078 --> 36:22.280
MIRANDA, OPEN THE DOOR.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.881
YOU'RE GONNA DIE IN THERE!

36:24.282 --> 36:27.084
COME ON, MIRANDA!

36:27.084 --> 36:32.690
WHAT IS IT?

36:33.090 --> 36:35.092
IT'S WHAT CREATING YOUR WALL.

36:37.895 --> 36:39.897
YOU KNOW, I GREW UP IN SEATTLE.

36:39.897 --> 36:41.499
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M
ACTUALLY PRAYING FOR RAIN.

36:41.899 --> 36:43.501
AND RAIN'S JUST A BYPRODUCT.

36:43.501 --> 36:46.304
WHAT WE NEED IS A GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED LIGHTNING STORM.

36:46.304 --> 36:51.909
THUNDER...
AND LIGHTNING.

36:51.909 --> 36:55.112
ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME.

36:55.513 --> 36:58.716
LET'S FIRE THIS OLD BIRD UP.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.324
IT'S WORKING.

37:06.324 --> 37:08.726
BRING IT ON.

37:08.726 --> 37:09.927
ALL RIGHT.

37:10.328 --> 37:11.929
EVERYBODY DO ME A FAVOUR,
DON'T TOUCH THE HULL.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.931
RIGHT NOW WE'RE PACKING
ABOUT A BILLION VOLTS.

37:14.332 --> 37:17.935
A BILLION, HUH?

37:19.136 --> 37:20.338
COME ON, WE NEED TO STOP IT.

37:20.338 --> 37:21.939
NO.

37:21.939 --> 37:26.744
WAIT...

37:33.951 --> 37:35.953
OF COURSE, IT'D
HAVE ITS OWN PROTECTION.

37:35.953 --> 37:39.957
THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENED TO MY FATHER AND
THE OTHERS, WASN'T IT?

37:41.959 --> 37:43.561
RIGHT THERE... RIGHT THERE.

37:43.561 --> 37:44.762
DON'T MOVE!

37:44.762 --> 37:46.364
OR I'LL SHOOT
HER WHERE SHE STANDS.

37:46.364 --> 37:49.166
COME HERE! COME HERE!

37:50.368 --> 37:51.969
WELL, LET'S GO.

37:51.969 --> 37:55.172
YOU'RE KEEPING EVERYBODY
WAITING FOR THE SHOW.

38:03.180 --> 38:04.782
ADAM, WE HAVE
TO BE POWERED UP BY NOW.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.384
WE'RE GOING TO START
LOSING THE STORM, ADAM.

38:06.384 --> 38:07.585
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE READY.

38:07.585 --> 38:08.786
FIRING AND...

38:09.186 --> 38:10.788
NOW.

38:13.190 --> 38:14.392
IT WON'T WORK, JOSH.

38:14.392 --> 38:15.593
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

38:15.593 --> 38:16.794
YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT GO AWAY.

38:17.194 --> 38:17.995
I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT GO AWAY.

38:18.396 --> 38:20.398
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE YOU GO AWAY.

38:21.999 --> 38:26.404
IT'S WORKING.
I CAN SEE THE TOWN.

38:27.204 --> 38:29.206
EMMA, IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

38:29.206 --> 38:30.408
WE NEED TO TAKE
OUT THE FIELD GENERATOR,

38:30.808 --> 38:32.009
OR IT'S GOING TO POWER
UP AGAIN AND TRAP US INSIDE.

38:32.410 --> 38:33.611
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

38:33.611 --> 38:35.212
I WANT YOU TO KEEP IT FOCUSED
ON THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD.

38:35.212 --> 38:36.414
THAT'S WHERE THE
GENERATOR HAS TO BE.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.015
OKAY.

38:38.015 --> 38:40.418
READY AND FIRING... NOW.

38:43.621 --> 38:46.023
I'M GONNA MISS YOU, MIRANDA.

38:57.635 --> 38:59.637
UGH...

39:31.669 --> 39:33.671
OH, MY GOD.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.272
YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:35.272 --> 39:37.675
THIS CAN'T BE...

39:38.876 --> 39:41.278
UGH...!

39:43.681 --> 39:45.683
NOT THIS TIME, JOSH.

39:53.290 --> 39:56.093
BRENNAN!

40:10.107 --> 40:11.709
WELL, YOU READY?

40:12.109 --> 40:13.310
BRENNAN, I CAN'T.

40:13.711 --> 40:16.113
I'M NOT READY.

40:16.113 --> 40:19.717
WELL, I GUESS I UNDERSTAND.

40:19.717 --> 40:22.520
I MEAN, YOUR WORLD JUST WIDENED
A MILLION TIMES OVER, RIGHT?

40:22.520 --> 40:24.922
STAY WITH ME.

40:24.922 --> 40:28.526
I WISH I COULD,
BUT YOU KNOW I CAN'T.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.528
I HAVE A LIFE.

40:30.528 --> 40:32.129
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
THINGS THAT I HAVE TO DO.

40:32.129 --> 40:35.733
I KNOW.

40:36.133 --> 40:39.336
WELL, WHEN YOU'RE...

40:39.336 --> 40:42.940
WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO SEE MORE OF THE WORLD,

40:42.940 --> 40:44.942
YOU GIVE ME A CALL, HUH.

40:45.342 --> 40:49.747
I WILL.

41:10.167 --> 41:11.769
OH, MAN...

41:11.769 --> 41:13.771
IT'S LIKE GOING FROM
A FISHBOWL TO THE ATLANTIC.

41:13.771 --> 41:15.372
I KIND OF ENVY THEM.

41:15.372 --> 41:17.775
NOW THEY GET A CHANCE
TO EXPERIENCE A FRESH NEW WORLD.

41:18.175 --> 41:19.777
I DON'T KNOW.

41:19.777 --> 41:21.378
I'VE BEEN IN THAT
WORLD MY WHOLE LIFE.

41:21.378 --> 41:25.783
I DON'T KNOW HOW FRESH IT IS.

41:26.984 --> 41:28.586
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

41:28.586 --> 41:31.789
OKAY.

41:35.392 --> 41:37.394
YOU OKAY?

41:37.394 --> 41:40.197
YEAH.

41:40.598 --> 41:43.801
YEAH, SMALL TOWN
LIVING'S JUST NOT FOR ME.

41:44.201 --> 41:46.604
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT
FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING.

41:46.604 --> 41:49.006
YEAH, WELL, IT HAS ITS MOMENTS.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.608
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

41:50.608 --> 41:55.012
I'M NOT VERY
GOOD WITH GOOD-BYES.

42:03.420 --> 42:06.624
LIKE SHAKESPEARE SAID,
"OH, BRAVE NEW WORLD..."
