<i>-coming out of the padding?</i>
<i>-Mm.</i>

03:09.731 --> 03:13.067
<i>So, the current travels through the wire</i>
<i>and into his skin.</i>

03:13.151 --> 03:18.072
<i>Now, you add sea air and his sweat,</i>
<i>perfect combo for maximum voltage.</i>

03:18.573 --> 03:20.533

<i>Well, we're not even sure</i>
<i>it's a murder yet.</i>

03:29.334 --> 03:32.003
<i>I mean, it could just be</i>
<i>a wardrobe malfunction.</i>

03:32.086 --> 03:33.588
<i>Wonderful. Can we go home, then?</i>

03:34.130 --> 03:36.549
<i>You know what? Uh, hold that thought.</i>

03:41.930 --> 03:43.765
<i>Okay, Pioneer.</i>

03:43.848 --> 03:47.310
<i>Best mixers on the market, and...</i>

03:54.776 --> 03:55.944
<i>[both chuckle]</i>

03:56.027 --> 03:59.072
<i>And, um, let's see here.</i>
<i>Well, looks intentional. It's a clean cut.</i>

03:59.530 --> 04:02.450
<i>Someone sabotagedÂ Pexxa's setup</i>
<i>before he went on stage,</i>

04:02.533 --> 04:05.286
<i>and so that, with the live wire</i>
<i>in the headphones,</i>

04:05.370 --> 04:06.746
<i>I mean, it's most likely murder.</i>

04:06.829 --> 04:08.539
<i>Well, surely someone</i>
<i>must have seen something</i>

04:08.623 --> 04:11.376
<i>before our charred DJ went to his demise.</i>

04:11.459 --> 04:13.544
<i>Let's just question the witnesses,</i>
<i>and case closed.</i>

04:13.628 --> 04:17.799
<i>Then we can all go back</i>
<i>to our previous engagements.</i>

04:18.132 --> 04:22.470
<i>Well, um, we do have about</i>
<i>500 potential witnesses</i>

04:23.179 --> 04:27.225
<i>that are all drunk,</i>
<i>and most likely very high.</i>

04:27.934 --> 04:28.810
<i>So...</i>

04:28.893 --> 04:30.520
<i>we're gonna be here a while.</i>

<i>It's just a phase.</i>

04:48.413 --> 04:49.455
<i>[crying intensifies]</i>

04:49.539 --> 04:50.665
<i>You missed our coffee date.</i>

<i>Okay. [sighs]</i>

05:08.016 --> 05:10.184
<i>You have my undivided attention.</i>

05:10.268 --> 05:11.227

05:12.145 --> 05:14.147

05:14.230 --> 05:15.106
<i>Mm!</i>

05:17.150 --> 05:18.067
<i>Okay, I'm sorry.</i>

05:18.151 --> 05:20.278

<i>with your mom.</i>

05:20.361 --> 05:21.195
<i>No.</i>

05:21.821 --> 05:24.324

05:25.033 --> 05:25.950
<i>Sucks for her.</i>

05:26.034 --> 05:28.161
<i>All I need to be is to </i>not <i>be her.</i>

05:28.745 --> 05:29.996
<i>[Charlie exclaims]</i>

05:30.705 --> 05:31.622
<i>So how do I do that?</i>

05:31.706 --> 05:33.416
<i>Use the blue pacifier!</i>

05:33.499 --> 05:34.500
<i>[Amenadiel] I am!</i>

05:35.084 --> 05:38.713
<i>-I'm sorry, Maze, what's the question?</i>
<i>-How do I not end up alone?</i>

05:38.796 --> 05:42.258
<i>That is not an easy question to answer.</i>

05:42.342 --> 05:44.344
<i>-[Charlie whines]</i>
<i>-Try swaddling him!</i>

05:44.427 --> 05:46.512
<i>[Amenadiel] Oh, what a wonderful idea!</i>

05:48.139 --> 05:50.725
<i>You just have to find someone</i>
<i>to connect with.</i>

05:51.100 --> 05:53.269
<i>I just scare everybody away.</i>

05:53.353 --> 05:55.355
<i>Well, I'm still here, right?</i>

05:55.938 --> 05:58.608
<i>So you just know that</i>
<i>when you find someone</i>

05:58.691 --> 06:00.735
<i>that you're romantically interested in,</i>

06:00.818 --> 06:02.612
<i>you just try not to be so scary.</i>

06:02.695 --> 06:05.907
<i>You know, be more open,</i>
<i>emotionally available.</i>

06:05.990 --> 06:07.283

<i>It sure is.</i>

06:30.431 --> 06:32.016
<i>I picked up this bad boy last week.</i>

<i>Yep, best job in the world.</i>

06:43.027 --> 06:45.363
<i>You wouldn't be able</i>

06:56.833 --> 07:00.378
<i>Look, I'm not allowed to give you</i>
<i>any real details, okay, but...</i>

07:00.461 --> 07:03.881

07:03.965 --> 07:07.009
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
<i>So, what-- what is your name?</i>

07:15.977 --> 07:17.562
<i>Maybe as, like, a real thank-you,</i>

07:17.645 --> 07:21.649
<i>I could take you out</i>
<i>for a drink or coffee or...</i>

07:23.359 --> 07:24.277
<i>Uh...</i>

<i>No, that's DJ Karnal!</i>

<i>I-I mean, I didn't know</i>
<i>he was headlining the show.</i>

07:57.226 --> 07:59.395
<i>It must've been a surprise appearance.</i>
<i>That's so cool.</i>

07:59.479 --> 08:02.231
<i>Yes, I must admit, he may be the one DJ</i>

08:02.315 --> 08:03.816
<i>who has even a modicum of talent.</i>

08:03.900 --> 08:06.235
<i>But then again,</i>
<i>his ludicrous name negates that.</i>

08:06.319 --> 08:08.654
<i>[ironic chuckle] I mean, "Karnal"? Really?</i>

08:09.238 --> 08:11.324

<i>-So you did it.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

08:49.904 --> 08:51.280
<i>I always knew you'd be a great cop.</i>

<i>How do you two know each other?</i>

08:53.699 --> 08:56.410
<i>Oh, um,Â Jed and I dated.</i>

<i>I suppose not.</i>

11:04.789 --> 11:06.207
<i>You think this was intentional?</i>

<i>Yes, we think that Pexxa was killed</i>

11:09.502 --> 11:11.754
<i>Pexxa's headphones?</i>
<i>He borrowed those from me...</i>

11:14.548 --> 11:16.133
<i>this morning, right before the show.</i>

11:16.217 --> 11:17.051
<i>He did?</i>

11:17.468 --> 11:20.137
<i>Okay, were the headphones out of</i>
<i>your possession before the show?</i>

11:20.429 --> 11:21.764
<i>No, I handed them straight to him.</i>

11:21.847 --> 11:24.684
<i>What about your mixing board?</i>
<i>Um, Pexxa's surge protector was cut off.</i>

11:24.767 --> 11:26.102
<i>No, we all use the same setup.</i>

11:26.185 --> 11:28.437
<i>Are you saying</i>
<i>someone's trying to kill me?</i>

11:28.521 --> 11:31.816
<i>Might I point out that</i>
<i>if no one else had the headphones,</i>

11:34.694 --> 11:35.695

<i>Sorry, man.</i>

<i>The detective had a child with you,</i>

<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

12:22.450 --> 12:25.327
<i>You know he tried to get back together</i>
<i>with Chloe when we first split up?</i>

<i>Look, I'm just saying,</i>
<i>watch out for that guy, all right?</i>

<i>Yeah, some ass-hat who's pissed</i>
<i>about my foundation</i>

12:40.259 --> 12:42.052
<i>building low-income housing at the marina.</i>

12:42.136 --> 12:43.471
<i>Of course he has a foundation.</i>

12:43.554 --> 12:45.181
<i>Uh, Detective...</i>

12:45.931 --> 12:48.559
<i>I've been thinking,</i>
<i>perhaps we dismissed DJ Dum-Dum</i>

<i>a little bit too quickly as the killer.</i>

<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-All right.</i>

<i>[sighs]</i>

<i>is the reputation of your yacht club</i>
<i>down the way.</i>

<i>-Well, I--</i>
<i>-I know you sent threatening emails to Jed</i>

<i>Well, why would a homeless woman</i>

<i>Maybe she wasn't homeless?</i>

<i>Maybe she broke in</i>
<i>to tamper with the headphones?</i>

<i>No one would go that far</i>

<i>Of a man-boy who scratches records</i>
<i>for a living? Now who's being absurd?</i>

<i>that any and all evidence</i>

18:53.423 --> 18:55.676
<i>I couldn't stand another minute</i>
<i>around Chloe's ex.</i>

18:56.343 --> 18:57.845
<i>The guy's perfect.</i>

18:57.928 --> 19:00.389
<i>He makes me feel</i>
<i>so bad about myself, you know?</i>

19:01.932 --> 19:04.184
<i>And I kind of already do that enough</i>
<i>on my own.</i>

19:04.685 --> 19:05.894
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

19:06.353 --> 19:08.438
<i>-You're a great guy.</i>
<i>-[scoffs]</i>

19:08.522 --> 19:09.356
<i>Hey.</i>

19:10.149 --> 19:12.317
<i>Great cop, great dad.</i>

19:13.235 --> 19:15.571
<i>And your hair, it's so high.</i>

19:15.654 --> 19:17.656
<i>[laughs]</i>

19:19.408 --> 19:20.284
<i>Thanks, man.</i>

19:23.036 --> 19:24.872
<i>There are things you don't know about me.</i>

19:26.331 --> 19:27.249
<i>Things I've done.</i>

19:29.209 --> 19:30.878
<i>And no matter how hard I try...</i>

19:34.256 --> 19:36.633
<i>I just don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make up for them.</i>

19:39.636 --> 19:40.762
<i>Listen to me, Daniel.</i>

19:42.472 --> 19:43.765
<i>We all have our demons.</i>

19:44.057 --> 19:45.225
<i>Myself included.</i>

19:47.227 --> 19:49.021
<i>But believe me when I say this...</i>

19:50.105 --> 19:51.356
<i>I know evil.</i>

19:53.233 --> 19:54.902
<i>And you, my friend, are not it.</i>

19:58.030 --> 20:00.157
<i>[Chloe] Okay, so we're looking for</i>
<i>Belinda Roberts.</i>

20:00.282 --> 20:02.492
<i>Ella pulled her prints off of Jed's gate.</i>

20:02.576 --> 20:06.079
<i>A park ranger said her car's been here</i>
<i>over a day, so she's probably hiding out.</i>

20:06.163 --> 20:09.374
<i>Great. Let's just find her so we can</i>
<i>finally be done with this case.</i>

20:09.750 --> 20:12.294
<i>So you're finally over the idea</i>
<i>that Jed's behind all this?</i>

20:12.377 --> 20:16.298
<i>Of course not. Once we find</i>
<i>this Belinda woman, Jed's co-conspirator,</i>

20:16.381 --> 20:19.718
<i>we'll get her to prove he's involved, and</i>
<i>then we can all go back to life pre-Jed.</i>

20:19.801 --> 20:20.802
<i>Oh.</i>

20:20.928 --> 20:25.432
<i>Well, I was hoping we could, um, solve</i>
<i>this case, uh, before the sun goes down.</i>

20:25.515 --> 20:27.100
<i>Like I said, sooner rather than later.</i>

20:27.184 --> 20:28.518
<i>[woman] Stop!</i>

20:28.769 --> 20:33.440
<i>One more step and you'll die.</i>

20:33.523 --> 20:34.524
<i>-Detective!</i>
<i>-Oh!</i>

20:34.608 --> 20:36.735
<i>Careful. I know how to handle snakes.</i>

20:36.818 --> 20:38.362
<i>-[Chloe panting]</i>
<i>-There...</i>

20:39.863 --> 20:40.781
<i>Careful.</i>

20:41.698 --> 20:43.659
<i>-[Chloe] Is it--</i>
<i>-[woman] No!</i>

20:44.952 --> 20:49.498
<i>Do you know how long</i>
<i>I have been waiting for copulation?</i>

20:49.581 --> 20:50.791
<i>You and me both.</i>

20:50.874 --> 20:52.501
<i>Clearly you're not aware</i>

20:53.043 --> 20:56.338
<i>of how rare sound recordings</i>
<i>of rattlesnake sex are.</i>

20:56.421 --> 20:58.090
<i>Well, it's not my strong suit, no.</i>

20:58.173 --> 21:01.593
<i>Their foreplay is incredibly intense.</i>

21:02.219 --> 21:03.762
<i>And if things go well,</i>

21:03.845 --> 21:06.306
<i>their sex can last for days.</i>

21:06.390 --> 21:07.266
<i>Huh.</i>

21:07.349 --> 21:08.642
<i>But you ruined it.</i>

21:09.017 --> 21:11.812
<i>Listen, we're here to ask about Jed Moore.</i>

21:12.229 --> 21:13.063
<i>Karnal.</i>

21:13.480 --> 21:15.148
<i>We know you broke into his studio.</i>

21:15.232 --> 21:16.942
<i>I don't have anything to say about that.</i>

21:17.025 --> 21:19.194
<i>[groans] Listen to me, Miss Snake Pervert.</i>

21:20.612 --> 21:22.531
<i>What did you desire from Jed?</i>

21:25.033 --> 21:26.618
<i>I want him to pay.</i>

21:26.702 --> 21:29.329
<i>Pay you for helping him</i>
<i>fake his murder attempts?</i>

21:29.913 --> 21:30.747
<i>Wait.</i>

21:31.123 --> 21:32.541
<i>Murder? No!</i>

21:32.624 --> 21:35.210
<i>He owes me for sampling</i>
<i>my sound recordings.</i>

21:35.294 --> 21:37.337
<i>His song, "Otter Vox,"</i>

21:37.421 --> 21:41.842
<i>relies heavily on my otter sex recordings,</i>
<i>and I have not been compensated.</i>

21:41.925 --> 21:43.427
<i>Well, that sounds like motive.</i>

21:43.719 --> 21:45.178
<i>What were you doing in his studio?</i>

21:47.055 --> 21:49.433
<i>I was planting recording devices.</i>

21:49.850 --> 21:53.478
<i>I was trying to record proof</i>
<i>that Karnal stole my tracks.</i>

21:53.562 --> 21:56.940
<i>Well, that is where we'll find proof</i>
<i>that Jed is behind all of this.</i>

21:57.024 --> 21:59.609
<i>-Or of who the real killer is.</i>
<i>-Mm.</i>

22:06.450 --> 22:07.284
<i>Hey.</i>

22:08.410 --> 22:09.870
<i>Hey. Good news.</i>

22:09.953 --> 22:11.747
<i>We found a woman</i>
<i>who broke into your studio</i>

22:11.830 --> 22:14.124
<i>and planted some secret</i>
<i>recording devices last week.</i>

22:14.207 --> 22:15.625
<i>That's good news?</i>

22:15.709 --> 22:18.128
<i>Well, we're hoping that</i>
<i>it will identify the killer.</i>

22:18.211 --> 22:19.463
<i>Whomever </i>he<i> may be.</i>

22:19.838 --> 22:20.672
<i>Hmm.</i>

22:20.756 --> 22:22.841
<i>Hey, what's with all the gift baskets?</i>

22:22.924 --> 22:24.343
<i>Oh. They're from my fans.</i>

22:24.426 --> 22:26.094
<i>They found out my place blew up,</i>

22:26.178 --> 22:28.805
<i>and they've been sending me stuff</i>
<i>from all around the world.</i>

22:29.181 --> 22:30.557
<i>It's crazy how devoted they are.</i>

22:30.640 --> 22:32.392
<i>Devoted to you? Yes, that is crazy.</i>

22:32.893 --> 22:33.727
<i>Crazy.</i>

22:34.686 --> 22:37.272
<i>Wait, do you think one of your fans</i>
<i>could be behind all this?</i>

22:37.356 --> 22:38.815
<i>Oh, I doubt it. They're harmless.</i>

22:39.066 --> 22:41.443
<i>Though I have heard of</i>
<i>a few really obsessed ones</i>

22:41.526 --> 22:42.736
<i>chatting on a message board,</i>

22:42.819 --> 22:44.154
<i>but I've never had a problem.</i>

22:44.237 --> 22:45.238
<i>That you know of.</i>

22:46.156 --> 22:47.824
<i>I'm gonna look into it. You stay put.</i>

22:48.617 --> 22:52.496
<i>Speaking of,</i>
<i>I am getting a little stir-crazy here.</i>

22:53.955 --> 22:54.873
<i>Oh.</i>

22:55.415 --> 22:58.001
<i>Well, I mean, you still have to be safe.</i>

22:58.085 --> 22:59.211
<i>You could stay--</i>

22:59.294 --> 23:01.129
<i>Cherry, are you inviting me to stay at--</i>

23:01.213 --> 23:02.631
<i>My place. Yes.</i>

23:02.714 --> 23:04.508
<i>Yes, that's exactly</i>
<i>what she's suggesting.</i>

23:04.591 --> 23:06.176
<i>-Excellent idea, Detective.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

23:06.259 --> 23:07.719
<i>It's like you're reading my mind.</i>

23:07.803 --> 23:08.887
<i>-[Chloe] Hmm.</i>
<i>-[Jed] Huh.</i>

23:09.262 --> 23:10.138
<i>Great.</i>

23:12.224 --> 23:13.058
<i>Shall we?</i>

23:13.141 --> 23:13.975
<i>Sure.</i>

23:18.271 --> 23:19.231
<i>Nice digs.</i>

23:19.314 --> 23:21.566
<i>Mm. Appears we have similar tastes.</i>

23:21.650 --> 23:23.693
<i>Yeah, I still can't believe</i>
<i>I have to be here.</i>

23:24.236 --> 23:26.029
<i>I mean, this whole thing is just...</i>

23:27.030 --> 23:28.281
<i>[sighs] It's crazy.</i>

23:28.365 --> 23:33.662
<i>Almost as crazy as if it had been</i>
<i>concocted by a madman to, say,</i>

23:33.745 --> 23:35.122
<i>lure back an old flame.</i>

23:35.205 --> 23:38.041
<i>Which is also pointless,</i>
<i>because the detective is spoken for.</i>

23:38.125 --> 23:40.252
<i>Wait, are you talking about Chloe?</i>

23:40.335 --> 23:42.462
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>-She said she wasn't in a relationship.</i>

23:42.546 --> 23:43.422
<i>Well, she is.</i>

23:44.423 --> 23:46.007
<i>Oh. [chuckles]</i>

23:46.174 --> 23:47.008
<i>I get it.</i>

23:48.427 --> 23:49.428
<i>You're interested in her.</i>

23:49.511 --> 23:51.721
<i>I'm not </i>interested <i>in her.</i>

23:51.805 --> 23:54.057
<i>The detective and I are seeing each other,</i>

23:54.141 --> 23:57.561
<i>which is why your little ruse</i>
<i>is not going to work.</i>

23:58.979 --> 23:59.813
<i>Listen.</i>

24:00.564 --> 24:01.565
<i>Chloe's amazing.</i>

24:02.315 --> 24:03.984
<i>I don't think I ever really got over her.</i>

24:04.067 --> 24:06.194
<i>I named my foundation after her,</i>
<i>for God's sakes.</i>

24:06.278 --> 24:07.237
<i>I know.</i>

24:07.320 --> 24:08.613
<i>But you do start to wonder.</i>

24:10.157 --> 24:11.158
<i>I mean...</i>

24:12.117 --> 24:14.786
<i>could she really be</i>
<i>as amazing as I remember?</i>

24:17.122 --> 24:18.874
<i>Then when I saw her this morning...</i>

24:19.958 --> 24:21.168
<i>Oh, man.</i>

24:21.626 --> 24:23.670
<i>My memory didn't even do her justice.</i>

24:23.837 --> 24:26.923
<i>All those feelings came flooding back,</i>
<i>and I started to wonder...</i>

24:28.508 --> 24:29.801
<i>You know, maybe this is fate.</i>

24:31.094 --> 24:32.596
<i>But if you think I would kill Pexxa</i>

24:32.679 --> 24:34.514
<i>and blow up my own studio</i>
<i>just to get her back,</i>

24:34.598 --> 24:37.934
<i>dude, you are even crazier about her</i>
<i>than I ever was.</i>

24:38.018 --> 24:39.102
<i>[chuckles]</i>

24:40.645 --> 24:41.897
<i>What are you doing?</i>

24:42.397 --> 24:44.399
<i>Just making sure. Tell me...</i>

24:45.650 --> 24:47.903
<i>What is it you truly desire?</i>

24:48.945 --> 24:50.405
<i>I...</i>

24:50.489 --> 24:52.532
<i>I wish I hadn't screwed things up</i>
<i>with Chloe.</i>

24:52.616 --> 24:55.452
<i>Ah-ha! I knew it! Admitting to motive.</i>

24:55.535 --> 24:58.538
<i>No. I mean, yeah, I wish Chloe</i>
<i>hadn't dumped me, but I just--</i>

24:58.622 --> 24:59.498
<i>Wait.</i>

25:00.123 --> 25:01.082
<i>She dumped you?</i>

25:01.583 --> 25:02.417
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:03.126 --> 25:06.546
<i>Everything was fine, and then</i>
<i>all of a sudden she just called it off.</i>

25:06.838 --> 25:11.468
<i>So she just changed</i>
<i>how she felt about you without...</i>

25:12.469 --> 25:13.637
<i>without any warning?</i>

25:14.221 --> 25:15.138
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:15.722 --> 25:16.681
<i>Pretty much.</i>

25:17.432 --> 25:19.809
<i>-It sucked.</i>
<i>-Right, then, Jed.</i>

25:21.144 --> 25:24.814
<i>I am going to need to know</i>
<i>exactly what you did wrong</i>

25:24.898 --> 25:27.651
<i>so I can steer clear</i>
<i>of your every mistake.</i>

25:28.235 --> 25:29.361
<i>Now...</i>

25:30.779 --> 25:32.072
<i>start talking.</i>

25:32.155 --> 25:34.241
<i>[sounds of birds, automobilesÂ </i>
<i>playing on speakers]</i>

25:34.324 --> 25:36.409
<i>I mean, even though we're just looking</i>
<i>at last weekend,</i>

25:36.493 --> 25:39.371
<i>when Jed left the headphones unattended,</i>
<i>still...</i>

25:39.871 --> 25:41.748
<i>Oy, so many sounds.</i>

25:41.831 --> 25:44.751
<i>I mean, you'd think</i>
<i>a DJ would want a quieter studio.</i>

25:45.627 --> 25:46.711
<i>Anything on your end?</i>

25:46.795 --> 25:50.549
<i>Listen to this. So,Â Karnalgirl506.</i>

25:51.216 --> 25:54.010
<i>"I left my whole world behind</i>
<i>for you, Jed,</i>

25:54.094 --> 25:55.845
<i>and now so will you.</i>

25:55.929 --> 25:59.266
<i>I missed you at the show,</i>
<i>I missed you at your studio,</i>

25:59.724 --> 26:02.102
<i>but you won't get away next time."</i>

26:02.185 --> 26:03.478
<i>Wow, sounds ominous.</i>

26:03.562 --> 26:04.396
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:05.272 --> 26:07.649
<i>That sounds like motive and opportunity.</i>

26:08.108 --> 26:11.403
<i>This Karnalgirl506 could be our killer.</i>
<i>Definitely female.</i>

26:12.028 --> 26:14.573
<i>Maybe a jilted sexual partner?</i>

26:14.656 --> 26:15.949
<i>Great. Now you can go.</i>

26:16.032 --> 26:18.076
<i>I can finish up this audio scrubbing</i>
<i>on my own.</i>

26:18.159 --> 26:19.494
<i>What do you mean, "go"? Go where?</i>

26:19.578 --> 26:21.079
<i>To Lucifer's.</i>

26:21.538 --> 26:23.623
<i>I thought you guys were gonna finally,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

26:23.915 --> 26:26.209
<i>hang out tonight. Mm.</i>

26:28.920 --> 26:30.338
<i>Yeah, well, it... [clears throat]</i>

26:30.422 --> 26:31.756
<i>...got postponed.</i>

26:31.840 --> 26:34.175
<i>Oh, you're nervous that</i>
<i>you won't measure up in bed.</i>

26:34.259 --> 26:36.469
<i>I mean, he is pretty experienced.</i>

26:36.553 --> 26:38.722
<i>I mean, I'd put it, like,</i>
<i>in the thousands, probably.</i>

26:38.805 --> 26:41.558
<i>But you know what, you got this.</i>
<i>You totally got this. You're sexy.</i>

26:41.641 --> 26:44.227
<i>That actually hadn't crossed my mind.</i>

26:44.311 --> 26:46.855
<i>Oh, you're waiting on an STD check!</i>
<i>Super smart.</i>

26:46.938 --> 26:48.398
<i>No, I... It just--</i>

26:48.857 --> 26:50.483
<i>Listen, Ella, he canceled.</i>

26:51.026 --> 26:54.487
<i>I guess he'd rather spend time with my ex</i>
<i>than hang out with me, okay?</i>

26:54.946 --> 26:57.699
<i>Yeah, that's worse. Like, way--</i>

26:57.782 --> 26:59.034
<i>-Shh!</i>
<i>-I mean...</i>

27:00.785 --> 27:01.620
<i>Listen.</i>

27:01.703 --> 27:03.330
<i>[rustling, beeping]</i>

27:03.455 --> 27:04.456
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

27:05.582 --> 27:07.208
<i>Sounds like someone's inside.</i>

27:07.292 --> 27:10.629
<i>Wait, I've heard that sound before.Â BRB.</i>

27:11.671 --> 27:12.547
<i>Be right back.</i>

27:15.342 --> 27:16.968
<i>[Jed] </i>See, Chloe loves a mystery.

27:18.011 --> 27:20.805
<i>We started out as friends,</i>
<i>both aspiring artists.</i>

27:21.556 --> 27:22.682
<i>We even worked together.</i>

27:24.559 --> 27:25.852
<i>I always wanted to be with her.</i>

27:25.935 --> 27:28.396
<i>Possibly relatable. Continue.</i>

27:29.481 --> 27:31.149
<i>In hindsight... [sighs]</i>

27:32.651 --> 27:34.778
<i>that's when the relationship</i>
<i>was at its best.</i>

27:34.861 --> 27:36.279
<i>Better without sex?</i>

27:36.863 --> 27:38.198
<i>[scoffs] Not relatable.</i>

27:38.281 --> 27:41.618
<i>Seriously, all that</i>
<i>unresolved sexual tension,</i>

27:41.701 --> 27:43.995
<i>the "Will they, won't they?"</i>
<i>It kept her hooked.</i>

27:44.746 --> 27:46.331
<i>Then we became a couple and...</i>

27:47.499 --> 27:49.084
<i>just lost interest.</i>

27:49.167 --> 27:50.085
<i>Oh...</i>

27:50.251 --> 27:52.671
<i>-Lacking in the bedroom department, I see.</i>
<i>-[laughs]</i>

27:52.754 --> 27:55.382
<i>Well... [chuckles]Â </i>
<i>...that won't be a problem.</i>

27:55.465 --> 27:56.800
<i>No, man, the sex was great.</i>

27:57.175 --> 27:59.511
<i>-I mean, like, really great.</i>
<i>-Mm.</i>

27:59.594 --> 28:01.721
<i>-Amazing, actually. The stuff she can do--</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

28:01.805 --> 28:03.098
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got it.</i>

28:03.682 --> 28:05.892
<i>But, just... It wasn't enough.</i>

28:06.810 --> 28:09.354
<i>It was the lack of mystery that did us in.</i>

28:09.854 --> 28:11.523
<i>And my mistake... [scoffs]</i>

28:11.606 --> 28:13.024
<i>was wearing my heart on my sleeve.</i>

28:14.150 --> 28:15.318
<i>Too much of an open book.</i>

28:15.402 --> 28:18.321
<i>Really? 'Cause I've been in therapy,</i>
<i>so I'm, you know, bit of an expert,</i>

28:18.947 --> 28:23.410
<i>but I believe that talking</i>
<i>about one's emotions is... good? No?</i>

28:23.493 --> 28:28.665
<i>No, see, Chloe looks at everything</i>
<i>like a case that needs to be solved.</i>

28:28.748 --> 28:30.166
<i>-Mm.</i>
<i>-What I didn't realize was</i>

28:30.250 --> 28:31.334
<i>when she solved me...</i>

28:31.876 --> 28:32.794
<i>figured me out...</i>

28:34.629 --> 28:35.463
<i>she was done.</i>

28:36.381 --> 28:39.300
<i>'Cause underneath the handsome,</i>
<i>the sexy, the fun...</i>

28:39.384 --> 28:40.301
<i>Mm.</i>

28:41.845 --> 28:42.846
<i>...it's just me.</i>

28:44.222 --> 28:46.057
<i>So she moved onto the next mystery.</i>

28:46.641 --> 28:48.143
<i>And you know, I don't blame her.</i>

28:48.226 --> 28:50.228
<i>Should have played it closer to the vest,</i>
<i>but I...</i>

28:50.770 --> 28:52.439
<i>I was just so naive, you know?</i>

28:52.522 --> 28:53.398
<i>Huh.</i>

28:54.858 --> 28:55.984
<i>[phone rings]</i>

28:56.067 --> 28:56.901
<i>Oh!</i>

28:57.652 --> 28:59.612
<i>Speak of the devil's girlfriend.</i>

29:00.739 --> 29:02.824
<i>Um... [sighs]</i>

29:04.242 --> 29:05.368
<i>How's that for mystery?</i>

29:05.994 --> 29:07.078
<i>Hey, Lucifer. Uh, listen,</i>

29:07.162 --> 29:09.873
<i>I'm just calling to make sure</i>
<i>everything is okay, and, um...</i>

29:10.123 --> 29:13.710
<i>I-I need to talk to Jed about</i>
<i>any crazy fans that he knows of,Â </i>

29:13.793 --> 29:16.588
<i>so just please call me when you get this.</i>

29:19.257 --> 29:20.216
<i>Shoot.</i>

29:21.426 --> 29:23.136
<i>Oh, that was fast, Ella.</i>

29:23.219 --> 29:26.598
<i>You changed your pants, shirt, face.</i>

29:26.681 --> 29:28.433
<i>-Oh.</i>
<i>-Hey, Maze.</i>

29:29.517 --> 29:31.352
<i>Oh, my God, I have that exact same shirt!</i>

29:31.436 --> 29:33.146
<i>Yes, you did! [chuckles]</i>

29:33.229 --> 29:35.148
<i>Wait. Did you steal my clothes?</i>

29:36.065 --> 29:37.150
<i>[Maze] Oh!</i>

29:37.275 --> 29:39.152
<i>I'm confused.</i>

29:39.235 --> 29:40.278
<i>[Maze sighs deeply]</i>

29:41.446 --> 29:43.239
<i>I understand how you feel...</i>

29:44.324 --> 29:45.158
<i>Ella.</i>

29:45.408 --> 29:48.286
<i>-Oh! You got my name right!</i>
<i>-[Maze chuckles]</i>

29:48.369 --> 29:50.205
<i>-Should I even ask?</i>
<i>-Oh, ask away.</i>

29:50.288 --> 29:53.208
<i>I am completely open</i>
<i>and emotionally available now,</i>

29:53.291 --> 29:55.835
<i>just like my good friend Ella.</i>

29:55.919 --> 29:56.920
<i>Aww.</i>

29:57.045 --> 29:59.005
<i>Okay, so you're acting like Ella, and...</i>

29:59.088 --> 30:01.216
<i>You know what? Never mind.</i>
<i>Real Ella, what do we have?</i>

30:01.299 --> 30:03.301
<i>Uh, that beeping sound, right,</i>

30:03.384 --> 30:05.637
<i>threw me back to dinnerÂ </i>
<i>at my </i>abuelita's.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.431
<i>I mean, the old lady is deaf as a squid.</i>

30:08.515 --> 30:11.392
<i>From the phone to the doorbell,</i>
<i>to the smoke detector,</i>

30:11.810 --> 30:14.771
<i>her place is full of noises</i>
<i>the woman can't hear.</i>

30:14.854 --> 30:17.023
<i>-Abuelita.</i>
<i>-Exactamente.</i>

30:17.106 --> 30:18.733
<i>Like this one time at my quinceaÃ±era,</i>

30:18.817 --> 30:20.026
<i>-she didn't even know--</i>
<i>-Ella.</i>

30:20.819 --> 30:22.695
<i>Right, right. So I did some digging,</i>

30:22.779 --> 30:26.616
<i>and this beeping comes</i>
<i>from a hearing aid with low battery,</i>

30:26.699 --> 30:29.160
<i>a digital ITE hearing aid, to be exact.</i>

30:29.244 --> 30:31.746
<i>Just like the one my deaf </i>abuelita<i> wears.</i>

30:32.372 --> 30:34.499
<i>-So the killer's an old lady?</i>
<i>-No, not necessarily.</i>

30:34.582 --> 30:36.376
<i>Loud music can damage hearing.</i>

30:36.459 --> 30:39.045
<i>So maybe Karnalgirl506</i>
<i>might wear a hearing aid.</i>

30:39.587 --> 30:40.421
<i>Exactly.</i>

30:40.797 --> 30:41.881
<i>Ever plan a rave?</i>

30:47.762 --> 30:49.973
<i>What's up? What's the emergency?</i>
<i>Is Charlie all right?</i>

30:50.056 --> 30:50.974
<i>Charlie's fine.</i>

30:51.599 --> 30:52.642
<i>[Charlie's cries intensify]</i>

30:52.725 --> 30:54.102
<i>Charlie's the same.</i>

30:54.185 --> 30:55.603
<i>It's Linda that's the problem.</i>

30:55.687 --> 30:57.480
<i>She just handed me the baby and left.</i>

30:57.564 --> 30:58.606
<i>Well, what'd you do?</i>

30:58.690 --> 31:00.066
<i>I just said what you said.</i>

31:00.149 --> 31:02.402
<i>That it's okay that she gets it wrong</i>
<i>all the time, </i>

31:02.485 --> 31:05.446
<i>and it's perfectly natural that she's</i>
<i>so clueless because no one ever...</i>

31:05.530 --> 31:06.447
<i>Oh.</i>

31:06.531 --> 31:07.657
<i>Okay.</i>

31:07.991 --> 31:10.535
<i>Right, I... I see what happened there.</i>

31:10.618 --> 31:11.661
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

31:12.245 --> 31:13.580
<i>Where'd Linda go again?</i>

<i>[Ella] Yay!</i>

31:37.353 --> 31:39.981
<i>Yes, yes, yes! Come, come, come.</i>

31:40.064 --> 31:40.940
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

31:41.441 --> 31:42.400
<i>You know, I'm good.</i>

31:43.109 --> 31:44.068
<i>Uh...</i>

31:44.360 --> 31:47.071
<i>Linda, I'm not quite sure</i>
<i>why Maze called you,</i>

31:47.155 --> 31:49.240
<i>but like I told you, this is a sting.</i>

31:49.324 --> 31:51.451
<i>Oh! I thought you said vodka.</i>

31:51.534 --> 31:53.536
<i>I invited her 'cause, you know,</i>

31:53.620 --> 31:56.915
<i>girls' night, lady love, bonding?</i>

31:56.998 --> 31:57.832

31:57.916 --> 32:02.295
<i>Right, okay, so first,</i>
<i>start with dancing, then more dancing,</i>

32:02.378 --> 32:05.089
<i>then bring it home with a classic</i>
<i>girls' night bar fight.</i>

32:05.173 --> 32:06.341
<i>Yeah!</i>

32:06.424 --> 32:07.342
<i>Time out.</i>

32:07.425 --> 32:11.721
<i>Ladies, let me remind you</i>
<i>that there is a killer here.</i>

32:11.804 --> 32:15.433
<i>As long as that killer doesn't cry,</i>
<i>spit up, or wet themselves,</i>

32:15.516 --> 32:17.810
<i>I am in. All right, good,</i>
<i>I'm gonna find him.</i>

32:17.894 --> 32:19.812
<i>All right, how do I help? How do I help?</i>

32:19.896 --> 32:21.648
<i>All right, let's do this. Let's split up,</i>

32:21.731 --> 32:24.943
<i>and remember, we're looking for</i>
<i>a girl with a hearing aid.</i>

32:25.026 --> 32:26.611

<i>-Yeah!</i>

32:34.994 --> 32:36.496
<i>Au contraire. [laughs]</i>

32:36.579 --> 32:39.123
<i>I am stoked to be with adults.</i>

<i>Uh...</i>

<i>Yeah, that's... That's a good question.</i>

32:46.339 --> 32:47.256
<i>Um...</i>

32:47.882 --> 32:51.135
<i>Well, we just had to do this sting at Lux</i>
<i>without him, you know?</i>

32:53.763 --> 32:55.473
<i>All right. Hearing aid. Let's go.</i>

32:55.556 --> 32:57.475
<i>Hearing aid!</i>

<i>Seriously, sex with Lucifer</i>
<i>is the last thing</i>

38:10.162 --> 38:11.289
<i>you should be worried about.</i>

38:11.372 --> 38:15.334
<i>What you should be worried about is</i>
<i>that he's unfathomably narcissistic,</i>

38:15.418 --> 38:18.004
<i>utterly terrified of intimacy,</i>

38:18.087 --> 38:20.756
<i>and sabotages everything good</i>
<i>that ever happens to him.</i>

38:20.840 --> 38:24.802
<i>So essentially, he's the oldest,</i>
<i>most immature person in the world.</i>

<i>Nay, "universe."</i>
