Kids, I gotta tell ya,

01:16.701 --> 01:18.234
I love the day
after Thanksgiving.

01:18.234 --> 01:20.000
We already got that
"giving thanks" crap

01:20.000 --> 01:22.267
out of the way,
and we get to have leftovers.

01:22.267 --> 01:23.300
Peg, is it ready yet?

01:23.300 --> 01:25.167
Here it comes!

01:25.601 --> 01:27.234
Ah!

01:27.234 --> 01:29.467
You know, Daddy,

01:29.467 --> 01:31.033
that was a great idea
last night:

01:31.033 --> 01:33.501
to only eat the cheese so
we'd have the crust for today.

01:33.501 --> 01:34.534
AL:
Yeah!

01:35.734 --> 01:37.400
I'll bet a lot of
other stupid families

01:37.400 --> 01:38.868
ate their whole
pizza last night.

01:38.868 --> 01:41.334
And today they're
probably just looking

01:41.334 --> 01:43.367
at the old empty
cardboard box.

01:44.701 --> 01:46.234
Uh-huh.

01:47.501 --> 01:49.300
I can't do it.

01:49.300 --> 01:50.701
Dad, I think I speak
for us all.

01:50.701 --> 01:53.334
This really bites
the big one.

01:53.334 --> 01:55.601
Why can't we have turkey
like real people?

01:55.601 --> 01:57.133
Aw, now, Bud.

01:57.133 --> 02:00.334
It's not like your father
is a doctor or a lawyer

02:00.334 --> 02:02.100
or a bathroom attendant

02:02.100 --> 02:03.968
or a circus geek.

02:03.968 --> 02:05.968
He's just
a shoe salesman,

02:05.968 --> 02:07.868
doing the best
he can.

02:07.868 --> 02:10.300
Okay, Peg, I think
we get the message here.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.567
Obviously,
this is the fault

02:11.567 --> 02:13.267
of the only one
who works around here.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.934

Well, goldarn it,
it's me.

02:21.734 --> 02:23.133
Well, what the heck,
I'll quit.

02:23.133 --> 02:25.934
Then we'll be
a-eating, won't we?

02:25.934 --> 02:28.801
Oh, honey, nobody
wants you to quit.

We all appreciate
what you do for this family.

[LAUGHING]

02:39.701 --> 02:41.734
Well, we might as well
face the facts.

02:41.734 --> 02:43.434
This food thing
isn't going to go away.

02:43.434 --> 02:45.000
We've gotta get
some money here.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.100
There's got to be something
here we can sell.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.167
How about Mom's
engagement ring?

02:49.167 --> 02:50.934
Kelly!

02:50.934 --> 02:52.767
Now, that ring is
a symbol of our love.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.334
We could never,
heh-heh,

02:54.334 --> 02:56.234
put a price
on that.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.067
That's right,
honey.

03:00.067 --> 03:01.200
Like they say:

03:01.200 --> 03:03.267
glass is forever.

03:04.701 --> 03:05.734
Hey.

03:05.734 --> 03:07.334
Oh, come on, Al.

03:07.334 --> 03:08.601
I had it
appraised

03:08.601 --> 03:09.834
the day after
our wedding.

03:09.834 --> 03:13.000
Remember when
you were resting?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.234
It was a big day
for Mommy, honey.

03:15.234 --> 03:18.200
Yeah. That was the last
day of rest for Daddy.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.501
Hm. What about Kelly's
school books?

03:24.701 --> 03:26.300
We could
sell these.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.501
Oh, yeah,
my English book.

03:28.501 --> 03:31.534
Oh, I ain't got
no use for that.

03:31.534 --> 03:33.300
Honey,
these school books

03:33.300 --> 03:36.200
are very important
to your future.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.033
Oh, who am I kidding?

03:38.033 --> 03:40.467
Let's see what
condition they're in.

03:40.467 --> 03:41.701
Well,
let's see.

03:41.701 --> 03:43.167
Wait a minute.
What do we got here?

03:43.167 --> 03:44.634
What's this?

03:44.634 --> 03:46.267

03:46.267 --> 03:48.000
Expulsion.

03:50.267 --> 03:52.400
Oh, here's something
interesting.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.434
Host a foreign
exchange student,

a month expenses.

03:56.968 --> 03:58.534
That's what
we'll do, Peg.

03:58.534 --> 04:02.200
We'll get us one of those
$500-a-month foreigners.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.167
Gee, I don't know,
honey.

04:05.167 --> 04:06.834
We don't have
much room.

04:06.834 --> 04:08.133
Where are they
going to sleep?

04:08.133 --> 04:09.567

the garage for?

04:09.567 --> 04:11.434

to the side.

Yeah, but it's freezing
in there, Dad.

I wonder when little "Y-vette"
will get here.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.868
Uh, Kelly.

04:33.868 --> 04:36.701
I believe her name
is pronounced "Yvette."

04:40.167 --> 04:42.434
I was pronouncing it
in English.

Oh, man,
what a break.

like, a sister.

05:05.033 --> 05:06.734
A real girl.

Not just a boy

05:08.234 --> 05:11.000

a pimple's body.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.033
It'll
be great.

05:12.033 --> 05:13.667
I can teach her
about American guys,

05:13.667 --> 05:15.267
and she can carry
my school supplies.

we should've

05:33.734 --> 05:35.567
picked Yvette up
at the bus station?

No. I hate
bus stations.

I see someone.
