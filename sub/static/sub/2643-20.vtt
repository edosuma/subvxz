00:01.613 --> 00:05.883
My new book <i>The Hidden Reality</i>
takes on a grand question:

00:05.885 --> 00:08.853
Is our universe
the only universe?

00:08.855 --> 00:12.089
You see, there's a growing
belief among scientists like me

00:12.091 --> 00:15.660
that ours may only be one
among many universes

00:15.662 --> 00:17.728
populating a gigantic cosmos.

00:18.230 --> 00:20.665
In <i>The Hidden</i> Reality,
I explore this possibility

00:20.667 --> 00:23.601
without presuming any knowledge
of mathematics or physics

00:23.603 --> 00:24.802
on the part of the reader.

00:25.804 --> 00:28.105
Hysterical.

00:29.107 --> 00:30.575
I'm glad you
talked me into this.

00:30.577 --> 00:33.044
We work so hard, sometimes,
it's nice to goof off

00:33.046 --> 00:35.746
- and do something silly.
- Agreed.

00:35.748 --> 00:39.283
Wait till you hear how he dumbs down
Werner Heisenberg for the crowd.

00:39.285 --> 00:41.302
You may actually believe
you're in a comedy club.

00:42.304 --> 00:45.423
You can think about Heisenberg's
"Uncertainty Principle"

00:45.425 --> 00:47.425
much like the special order menu

00:47.427 --> 00:49.861
that you find in certain Chinese
restaurants, where you have

00:49.863 --> 00:52.897
dishes in column A
and other dishes in column B,

00:52.899 --> 00:55.032
and if you order the first dish
in column A,

00:55.034 --> 00:57.235
you can't order the corresponding
dish in column B.

00:57.737 --> 00:59.804
That's sort of like the
"Uncertainly Principle."

01:00.306 --> 01:03.007
♪ Ba-dum-bump. ♪

01:05.009 --> 01:08.012
Say, I heard an interesting tidbit
about Howard and Bernadette.

01:08.014 --> 01:10.147
Really, Amy? Gossip?

01:10.149 --> 01:11.883
I'm disappointed in you.

01:11.885 --> 01:13.184
Now, now.

01:13.186 --> 01:16.254
Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar
has identified gossip

01:16.256 --> 01:18.656
as an aid to social
bonding in large groups.

01:19.158 --> 01:22.326
Forgive my language,
but "poppycock."

01:22.328 --> 01:23.361
What if he's right?

01:23.363 --> 01:26.761
And by not participating in gossip,
society breaks down into

01:26.833 --> 01:29.200
small feral bands of tattooed
motorcycle riders

01:29.202 --> 01:31.547
fighting to the death over the
last few cans of tuna fish?

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:12.272 --> 01:32.971
Fine.

01:32.972 --> 01:35.239
In the parlance
of the urban music scene,

01:35.241 --> 01:37.875
"What's the 4-1-1"?

01:38.877 --> 01:41.545
Bernadette is thinking about
breaking up with Howard.

01:41.547 --> 01:44.382
I believe our nation's
tuna cans are safe.

01:45.384 --> 01:47.618
Excuse me.
Dr. Greene, question?

01:48.620 --> 01:49.486
Yes?

01:49.488 --> 01:50.871
You've dedicated
your life's work

01:50.873 --> 01:52.890
to educating
the general populace

01:52.892 --> 01:55.426
about complex scientific ideas.

01:55.428 --> 01:56.694
Yes, in part.

01:56.696 --> 01:58.229
Have you ever considered

01:58.231 --> 02:00.364
trying to do something useful?

02:02.467 --> 02:05.202
Perhaps, reading to the elderly?

02:06.204 --> 02:06.854
Excuse me?

02:06.856 --> 02:10.441
Yeah, but not your books;
something they might enjoy.

02:12.243 --> 02:14.178

02:47.481 --> 02:51.017
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

02:51.019 --> 02:55.088
My father taught me archery
as a child.

02:58.625 --> 03:00.426
It's odd how the activity

03:00.428 --> 03:03.429
brings back the smell
of Kmart bourbon.

03:04.264 --> 03:07.667
- Perfect.
- I know.

03:07.669 --> 03:10.203
What an elf
I would have made.

03:12.138 --> 03:12.839
Whoo.

03:12.841 --> 03:14.006
What do you think you're doing?

03:14.008 --> 03:15.541
Shooting at a target?

03:15.543 --> 03:16.509
With what?

03:16.511 --> 03:18.678
- An arrow.
- Really?

03:18.680 --> 03:21.614
I didn't see you draw one
from your quiver.

03:21.616 --> 03:23.683
I'm not going to do that,
Sheldon.

03:23.685 --> 03:26.686
Leonard, the people at Nintendo
can only go so far

03:26.688 --> 03:30.156
in helping us recreate
an actual athletic experience.

03:30.158 --> 03:32.225
We have to do our part, too.

03:39.632 --> 03:41.634
That was uncalled for,
but...

03:41.636 --> 03:44.637
I'll play along... Ow!

03:47.774 --> 03:51.210
I had an unusual experience
with Amy last night.

03:51.212 --> 03:54.480
Really? How could you tell?

03:56.382 --> 03:58.985
She was attempting
to engage me in gossip.

03:58.987 --> 04:00.720
- Mm. You don't say.
- Yes.

04:00.722 --> 04:02.655
I think prolonged exposure
to Penny

04:02.657 --> 04:05.558
has turned her into a bit
of a Gabby Gertie.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.293
So, what's the gossip?

04:07.295 --> 04:09.395
Oh, please, I was just
pointing it out.

04:09.397 --> 04:11.914
I have no desire to engage
in the activity.

04:11.916 --> 04:13.332
Fine, don't tell me.

04:14.201 --> 04:17.587
All right, get this.

04:18.089 --> 04:21.274
Bernadette is thinking
about breaking up with Howard.

04:21.276 --> 04:22.608
Oh...

04:22.610 --> 04:24.744
That's too bad.
I wonder what happened.

04:24.746 --> 04:26.913
Mm, it's hard to say.
I can only speculate

04:26.915 --> 04:28.347
based on the data I collected

04:28.349 --> 04:30.216
watching my parents' marriage
implode.

04:30.218 --> 04:33.636
In that case,
the woman dives into religion,

04:33.638 --> 04:36.389
while the man dives
into a bottle-blonde bartender

04:36.391 --> 04:39.976
who tries to buy my love
with action figures.

04:40.578 --> 04:41.928
Oop! Out of arrows.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.942
Boy, you sure get your money's
worth out of these games.

04:58.979 --> 05:02.615
- Priya, can I come in?
- Sure.

05:04.117 --> 05:05.451
Oh, God.

05:06.253 --> 05:07.620
What?
It's okay.

05:07.622 --> 05:10.590
You didn't know.
I'll take care of it.

05:10.592 --> 05:12.642
What-what did I do?

05:12.644 --> 05:14.093
Sheldon doesn't allow flossing

05:14.095 --> 05:15.661
that close to the mirror.

05:15.663 --> 05:16.762
You're kidding.

05:16.764 --> 05:18.364
It's a splatter thing.

05:18.366 --> 05:20.199
There's a little piece of tape
on the floor

05:20.201 --> 05:22.134
you're supposed to stand behind.

05:22.136 --> 05:24.070
- That's madness.
- I know.

05:24.072 --> 05:26.305
Just do it. There's a big
inspection coming up,

05:26.307 --> 05:29.325
and I don't want to lose
my TV privileges.

05:30.027 --> 05:31.444
You really need
to let me take a look

05:31.446 --> 05:33.179
at that roommate agreement,
one of these days.

05:33.181 --> 05:34.697
Mm, I don't know.

05:34.699 --> 05:36.866
I get a lawyer,
he gets a lawyer...

05:36.868 --> 05:39.485
It's just easier
to stand behind the tape.

05:39.487 --> 05:41.220
Oh, by the way,
a fellow at work

05:41.222 --> 05:43.005
said I could use his
Dodger tickets this weekend.

05:43.007 --> 05:45.291
- Does that sound like fun?
- Yeah!

05:45.293 --> 05:48.094
Dodgers are baseball,
right?

05:48.096 --> 05:50.162
You'll need to explain
the game to me.

05:50.164 --> 05:51.597
Mm, it's complicated.

05:51.599 --> 05:53.666
But as I remember it,
the essentials are

05:53.668 --> 05:57.002
"get chosen last, get hit
by the ball, cry, go home."

05:57.004 --> 06:00.640
Well, regardless,
I've got four tickets.

06:00.642 --> 06:03.142
And I was thinking we can bring
Bernadette and Howard.

06:03.144 --> 06:06.612
She's really interesting,
and I bet I can get used to him.

06:06.614 --> 06:08.514
Well, it might not
be a great idea

06:08.516 --> 06:10.950
- to invite those two.
- Why not?

06:10.952 --> 06:12.785
Don't tell anybody
I told you,

06:12.787 --> 06:14.787
but I heard she might
be breaking up with him.

06:14.789 --> 06:16.656
Oh... too bad...

06:16.658 --> 06:19.041
Although I do know one person
for whom that's good news.

06:19.043 --> 06:20.192
Really? Who?

06:20.194 --> 06:21.460
My brother.

06:21.462 --> 06:22.828
He's got a big crush
on Bernadette.

06:26.132 --> 06:27.166
What?

06:27.868 --> 06:29.268
You're kidding!

06:29.270 --> 06:32.221
No. I found poems
he wrote about her.

06:32.223 --> 06:33.639
Very disturbing.

06:33.641 --> 06:37.843
"Oh, Bernadette,
please play my clarinet."

06:39.646 --> 06:43.049
- Wow, that's hard to believe.
- Yes.

06:43.051 --> 06:44.917
And for years,
everyone in my family

06:44.919 --> 06:47.987
was convinced that <i>he</i> was
the clarinet enthusiast.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.741
Hmm. What's that
piece of tape?

06:51.743 --> 06:55.528
Oh, that one doesn't
apply to you. You sit.

06:57.763 --> 06:59.265
- Hey!
- Hey! How's it going?

06:59.267 --> 07:01.400
Not too bad. Did you hear
about Howard and Bernadette?

07:01.402 --> 07:03.369
'Course I heard about it.
How did you hear about it?

07:03.371 --> 07:05.204
I heard about it
from Sheldon.

07:05.206 --> 07:07.256
- He got it from Amy.
- Oh, damn it.

07:07.258 --> 07:09.208
I told Amy that in the
strictest confidence.

07:09.210 --> 07:12.378
Boy, some people are
such blabbermouths.

07:12.380 --> 07:13.796
Well, whatever.

07:13.798 --> 07:15.181
I'm sure Bernadette
can do better.

07:15.183 --> 07:18.751
Do you think a sexually ambivalent
Indian astrophysicist

07:18.753 --> 07:21.437
with selective mutism
and alcohol issues is better than

07:21.439 --> 07:24.807
a hundred-pound Jewish guy
who lives with his mom?

07:24.809 --> 07:27.360
You are kidding.
Raj likes Bernadette?

07:27.362 --> 07:30.946
I didn't say Raj.
Who said <i>Raj?</i>

07:31.865 --> 07:32.698
Okay, give.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.133
How do you know?
Did he tell you?

07:34.635 --> 07:36.485
- No.
- Well, then who?

07:36.487 --> 07:38.654
I can't say...

07:38.656 --> 07:42.074
Priya told you.
What a little gossip.

07:42.076 --> 07:45.044
You know, not an attractive
quality in a woman, Leonard.

07:45.046 --> 07:48.781
Not judging,
just my opinion.

07:48.783 --> 07:50.750
Well, The point is,
if this got out,

07:50.752 --> 07:52.952
it would destroy Howard
and Raj's friendship.

07:52.954 --> 07:54.053
You don't have to worry.

07:54.055 --> 07:57.623
Unlike Amy and Priya,
I know how to keep a secret.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.559
You're the one who told Amy
in the first place.

08:00.561 --> 08:02.461
In confidence!

08:07.401 --> 08:10.703
Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.
How are you?

08:10.705 --> 08:12.938
We're very rich
in a very poor country.

08:12.940 --> 08:15.508
So, all in all,
can't complain.

08:16.510 --> 08:17.543
So, Priya,

08:17.545 --> 08:20.246
how are enjoying
staying with your brother?

08:20.248 --> 08:22.515
It's fine. But if
I'm going to stay

08:22.517 --> 08:23.682
in Los Angeles much longer,

08:23.684 --> 08:25.084
I think I should
get my own place.

08:25.086 --> 08:26.085
Why?

08:26.087 --> 08:28.354
Is Rajesh not making you
feel comfortable?

08:28.356 --> 08:31.157
Rajesh, why aren't you making
your sister comfortable?

08:31.659 --> 08:33.726
I am making her comfortable.

08:33.727 --> 08:34.960
Besides, she's not
sleeping here

08:34.962 --> 08:37.196
half the time anyw...

08:38.664 --> 08:39.799
What?

08:39.801 --> 08:41.400
Where are you
sleeping, Priya?

08:41.402 --> 08:43.235
It's a figure of
speech, Daddy.

08:43.236 --> 08:46.839
It means I-I work late.

08:46.841 --> 08:48.908
Please tell me
you're not dating an American.

08:48.910 --> 08:50.543
I knew this would happen.

08:50.545 --> 08:52.211
Rajesh, are you
letting your sister

08:52.213 --> 08:53.913
date that little Howard boy?

08:54.915 --> 08:57.483
Now, hold on. If she
is dating an American,

08:57.485 --> 08:58.984
that's not a bad way to go.

08:58.986 --> 08:59.952
He's Jewish.

08:59.954 --> 09:01.887
Those chaps are
very successful,

09:01.889 --> 09:03.889
and they don't drink a lot.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.358
It-It doesn't matter.
Howard has a girlfriend.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.860
- For now.
- What does that mean?

09:07.862 --> 09:09.061
I'll tell you later.

09:09.063 --> 09:11.130
Is something going on
with him and Bernadette?

09:11.132 --> 09:13.332
- Who's Bernadette?
- Doesn't sound Jewish.

09:13.334 --> 09:15.301
You can't tell by that.

09:15.303 --> 09:18.938
Winona Ryder is Jewish.

09:18.940 --> 09:20.973
Okay, we're getting
off the subject.

09:20.975 --> 09:22.741
Rajesh, I want
you to try harder

09:22.743 --> 09:24.310
to make your sister
feel welcome.

09:24.312 --> 09:25.878
Thank you, Daddy.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.580
Don't worry. Everything I have,
I share with her.

09:27.582 --> 09:29.415
Including my friend Leon...

09:30.417 --> 09:32.651
Good night, Mummy.
Good night, Daddy.

09:33.487 --> 09:37.189
Oh, my God,
I think you broke my toe!

09:37.691 --> 09:39.425
You should have kept
your mouth shut.

09:39.427 --> 09:41.327
Fair enough.

09:41.329 --> 09:43.896
Now, what's up with Clarinet...?
Bernadette!

09:48.635 --> 09:51.170
I've been thinking about
Dr. Greene's efforts

09:51.171 --> 09:53.939
to make science palatable
for the masses.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.508
Oh, yeah?
What about it?

09:56.210 --> 09:58.677
That's all. I've just
been thinking about it.

10:00.213 --> 10:02.982
Now, I'm thinking
about fractal equations.

10:04.651 --> 10:06.251
Now I'm thinking about

10:06.253 --> 10:09.321
the origin of the phrase
"train of thought."

10:09.323 --> 10:11.090
Now I'm thinking about trains.

10:13.759 --> 10:15.728
Are you listening
to this guy?

10:15.730 --> 10:17.563
Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.

10:17.565 --> 10:18.864
I was somewhere else.

10:18.866 --> 10:21.433
Lucky bastard.

10:22.936 --> 10:26.338
Now I'm thinking about Jell-O.

10:26.840 --> 10:27.806
So what's up?

10:28.308 --> 10:30.543
It's a Bernadette thing.

10:31.545 --> 10:35.114
Oh, no. I hope
everything's okay.

10:37.416 --> 10:39.585
Whatever it is,
we're here for you.

10:39.587 --> 10:41.670
You can tell us anything.

10:41.672 --> 10:44.390
Yeah. Good or devastating.

10:45.958 --> 10:47.626
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

10:47.628 --> 10:50.062
- Marry you?   - What?
- Yeah.

10:50.064 --> 10:53.632
I just need to figure out the
right time to pop the question.

10:53.634 --> 10:57.536
- Oh, I'd wait.
- No rush, no rush.

10:58.773 --> 11:01.023
Oh, great. It's my cousin David
about the ring.

11:01.025 --> 11:03.208
Hey, David, what'd you find?

11:03.210 --> 11:04.910
Sure, a half a caret's fine.

11:05.912 --> 11:08.981
Her freakishly small hands
make anything look big.

11:10.150 --> 11:12.217
It's one of the reasons
I love her.

11:15.387 --> 11:18.157
Man, he's going
to be blindsided.

11:18.159 --> 11:22.528
I know. It'll be awful.

11:22.530 --> 11:24.930
Why are you smiling?

11:26.266 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, Raj, why?

11:28.002 --> 11:31.804
Uh, a smile means something
different in my country.

11:32.806 --> 11:36.742
You know, tears of joy,
smile of sadness.

11:36.744 --> 11:39.044
India's a goofy place.

11:40.046 --> 11:43.616
Oh, I'm back to trains.

11:43.618 --> 11:46.352
Woo-woo.

11:49.508 --> 11:52.235
Did I tell you our lab got
a grant to study addiction?

11:52.236 --> 11:54.269
- No.
- Fascinating work.

11:54.271 --> 11:58.006
I recently trained a capuchin
monkey to smoke cigarettes.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.875
Have you learned anything?

11:59.877 --> 12:03.345
Yes. He looks much cooler
than the non-smoking monkeys.

12:04.748 --> 12:06.482
Although it's not
much of a contest.

12:06.484 --> 12:10.119
The other monkeys just
sit around and masturbate.

12:12.622 --> 12:18.160
If you don't mind, I'd like to stop
listening to you and start talking.

12:18.162 --> 12:19.828
By all means.

12:19.830 --> 12:22.297
Howard has announced
his intention

12:22.299 --> 12:24.466
to propose marriage
to Bernadette.

12:24.468 --> 12:26.001
I don't understand.

12:26.003 --> 12:28.604
The original piece of gossip
indicated an impending breakup.

12:28.606 --> 12:29.705
I know.

12:29.707 --> 12:32.241
The group consensus
is that his proposal

12:32.243 --> 12:36.111
will be met with an humiliating,
soul-crushing rejection.

12:36.113 --> 12:39.148
Everyone was set a-twitter.

12:39.150 --> 12:42.885
Although oddly,
no one tweeted.

12:44.322 --> 12:46.132
It's not surprising that
the story has captured

12:46.133 --> 12:48.059
the attention of our
little circle of friends.

12:48.092 --> 12:49.825
Are you familiar
with meme theory?

12:49.827 --> 12:52.427
I'm familiar with
everything, but go on.

12:52.429 --> 12:54.730
Meme theory suggests

12:54.732 --> 12:57.332
that items of gossip
are like living things

12:57.334 --> 13:00.135
that seek to reproduce
using humans as their host.

13:00.137 --> 13:03.372
I'm no stranger to
memetic epidemiology.

13:03.374 --> 13:05.240
At Johnson Elementary School,

13:05.242 --> 13:10.045
the phrase "Shelly Cooper's
a smelly pooper" spread like wildfire.

13:11.047 --> 13:12.681
I should think so.

13:12.683 --> 13:14.416
That's gold.

13:17.754 --> 13:21.790
Your meme hypothesis
does intrigue me.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.859
How might we examine
this more closely?

13:23.861 --> 13:27.729
Do you have any ethical qualms
regarding human experimentation?

13:27.731 --> 13:32.701
It's one of the few forms of interaction
with people that I don't find repellent.

13:32.703 --> 13:36.171
We need to fabricate a
tantalizing piece of gossip.

13:36.173 --> 13:40.076
And a second non-tantalizing
piece to use as a control.

13:40.078 --> 13:42.444
Then we'll track its progress
through our social group

13:42.446 --> 13:44.779
and interpret the results through
the competing academic prisms

13:44.781 --> 13:48.884
of memetic theory,
algebraic gossip and epidemiology.

13:48.886 --> 13:54.223
Look at you, getting me to
engage in the social sciences.

13:55.558 --> 13:59.294
You're a vixen,
Amy Farrah Fowler.

14:04.851 --> 14:06.235
Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?

14:06.237 --> 14:08.370
Sheldon and I engaged
in sexual intercourse.

14:08.372 --> 14:11.406
In other news, I'm thinking of starting
an herb garden. Mum's the word. Gotta go.

14:16.946 --> 14:19.781
Oh, hey, Raj, what
are you doing here?

14:19.783 --> 14:24.653
I just felt like drinking alone...
because I'm deep and dark.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.355
Uh-huh.

14:26.357 --> 14:27.856
So, uh, Howard's not here?

14:27.858 --> 14:30.692
No. It's just one of those
times when it's just you and me.

14:30.694 --> 14:32.794
Like when the three of us
went to the movies

14:32.796 --> 14:34.529
and you and I waited outside
the bathroom

14:34.531 --> 14:37.332
while Howard threw up
Red Vines and Cherry Coke.

14:38.334 --> 14:39.902
Do you remember that?

14:39.904 --> 14:41.003
Yeah.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.237
Me, too.

14:42.239 --> 14:44.006
Good times.

14:45.008 --> 14:46.909
Alright, 16 wants
to order appetizers.

14:46.911 --> 14:49.544
- Oh, thanks.
- This was nice.

14:53.816 --> 14:55.067
What the hell are you doing?

14:55.069 --> 14:57.352
Howard is your best friend,
and that is his girlfriend.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.853
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

14:58.855 --> 15:00.322
I was when I came in,

15:00.324 --> 15:02.824
but it's amazing what
liquor does to guilt.

15:03.826 --> 15:05.127
Besides what you
might not know is...

15:05.129 --> 15:07.496
Bernadette is planning on
breaking up with Howard.

15:07.498 --> 15:09.497
Well, I know that.
How do you know that?

15:09.498 --> 15:10.098
My sister told me.

15:10.100 --> 15:13.001
Oh, that gossipy bitch!

15:14.503 --> 15:15.370
No offense.

15:15.372 --> 15:16.421
None taken.

15:16.423 --> 15:18.640
You should hear how
she talks about you.

15:20.009 --> 15:22.311
Okay, listen, just because Howard
and Bernadette are having problems,

15:22.313 --> 15:24.346
does not mean you should
be here sniffing around.

15:24.348 --> 15:25.564
What can I do?

15:25.566 --> 15:27.716
I can't stop
thinking about her.

15:28.718 --> 15:30.936
All right, try
thinking about this...

15:30.938 --> 15:33.021
Sheldon and Amy had sex.

15:33.523 --> 15:36.158
Shut your ass!

15:40.263 --> 15:41.830
Yeah, it's true.
Amy told me.

15:41.832 --> 15:43.699
How did that even happen?

15:43.701 --> 15:45.334
Did they know that's
what they were doing

15:45.336 --> 15:47.569
when they were doing it?

15:47.571 --> 15:49.972
I-I guess they just figured
it out at some point.

15:49.974 --> 15:51.306
Wow.

15:51.308 --> 15:55.077
I can't believe old
Smelly Pooper finally got laid.

15:57.397 --> 16:00.015
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:00.017 --> 16:00.949
Hope you're hungry.

16:01.951 --> 16:03.418
Interesting.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.687
A friendly sentiment
in this country,

16:05.689 --> 16:09.291
cruel taunt in the Sudan.

16:10.126 --> 16:12.761
It's a lesson in context.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.863
Will Amy be
joining us for dinner?

16:14.865 --> 16:16.398
Yes, I believe so.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.866
Good, good.

16:17.868 --> 16:21.069
Everything...
okay between you two?

16:26.275 --> 16:28.643
Yes.

16:28.645 --> 16:31.079
Why do you ask?

16:32.081 --> 16:33.215
No reason.

16:33.717 --> 16:35.417
I was just talking to Raj,

16:35.419 --> 16:39.121
and he mentioned what a lovely
glow she has these days.

16:40.823 --> 16:43.692
Did he mean
as if she'd been out in the sun,

16:43.694 --> 16:47.262
tending an herb garden without
wearing a hat or sunblock?

16:49.298 --> 16:51.600
No.

16:51.602 --> 16:54.803
That's not what he meant.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.773
Well, we may never know.

16:57.775 --> 16:58.907
As my mother would say,

16:58.909 --> 17:02.778
the Asians are
an inscrutable folk.

17:04.881 --> 17:07.281
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

17:07.284 --> 17:09.818
Yeah, you do.
You dog, you.

17:16.192 --> 17:17.792
Did you get that?

17:17.795 --> 17:19.895
Every word.

17:19.896 --> 17:23.065
Our false gossip meme appears
to have reached node lambda.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.165
This is moving faster
than we thought.

17:24.568 --> 17:25.133
Agreed.

17:25.135 --> 17:26.233
It appears the rate

17:26.236 --> 17:27.402
of gossip transmission

17:27.404 --> 17:29.471
is proportional
to the number of nodes squared.

17:29.473 --> 17:32.074
I must say, Amy,

17:32.076 --> 17:34.009
pretending to have
intercourse with you

17:34.011 --> 17:37.946
is giving me a great
deal of satisfaction.

17:37.948 --> 17:40.982
Slow down, Sheldon.
I'm not quite there yet.

17:43.753 --> 17:45.654
- Pass the soy sauce.
- Sure.

17:46.656 --> 17:49.324
Bernadette just asked about
my sexual encounter with you.

17:49.326 --> 17:51.860
The meme has reached
full penetration.

17:55.063 --> 17:56.932
Pun intended?

17:57.934 --> 18:00.068
No. Happy accident.

18:01.570 --> 18:03.171
This is remarkable.

18:03.173 --> 18:05.056
Took less than 24 hours.

18:05.558 --> 18:06.908
I should let you know

18:06.910 --> 18:09.227
that she asked for details
about our dalliance.

18:09.229 --> 18:10.879
Interesting.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.515
So it went beyond the
mere fact of coitus

18:13.517 --> 18:17.119
to a "blow by blow,"
as it were.

18:18.121 --> 18:19.237
Pun intended?

18:19.539 --> 18:22.557
I'm sorry. What pun?

18:23.959 --> 18:26.027
Not important.

18:26.029 --> 18:29.698
I described your lovemaking
as "aloof, but effective."

18:30.700 --> 18:33.401
I wish you hadn't done that.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.170
That's going to make
me a chick magnet,

18:35.172 --> 18:38.874
and I'm so busy as it is.

18:38.876 --> 18:40.375
Hey, everybody,

18:40.377 --> 18:43.245
I got something I want
to ask Bernadette,

18:43.247 --> 18:45.514
and I can't think
of a better time

18:45.516 --> 18:47.149
than when I'm
with all my friends.

18:47.151 --> 18:48.416
Oh, hold on, Howard.

18:48.418 --> 18:50.785
There's lots of better times.

18:51.888 --> 18:53.388
Leonard, please.
The man is talking.

18:53.390 --> 18:57.459
Let him get it out, and let
the chips fall where they may.

18:58.461 --> 19:00.562
Thank you.

19:01.664 --> 19:04.733
Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski...

19:04.735 --> 19:06.768
Oh, God.
What's happening?

19:07.770 --> 19:10.572
I know things haven't
been perfect with us,

19:10.574 --> 19:12.007
and we've had our problems,

19:12.009 --> 19:14.309
but I just have to tell you,
from the moment I...

19:14.311 --> 19:16.878
Howard, let me just
stop you right here.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.047
This is it.

19:20.416 --> 19:22.851
Yes.

19:22.853 --> 19:24.853
Yes, what?

19:24.855 --> 19:26.855
Yes, I will marry you.

19:26.857 --> 19:28.356
- You will?
- You will?

19:28.358 --> 19:29.758
I will.

19:30.626 --> 19:32.227
I will!

19:32.229 --> 19:33.862
Oh, I love you so much.

19:33.864 --> 19:35.180
Oh, I love you, too.

19:35.182 --> 19:36.765
Congratulations!

19:37.136 --> 19:38.635
Oh, it's so exciting.

19:42.874 --> 19:45.308
I wonder what
changed her mind.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.944
Perhaps your talk
of my sexual prowess

19:47.946 --> 19:50.580
renewed her faith in love.

19:50.582 --> 19:53.350
As good an explanation as any.

19:54.719 --> 19:56.920
That's great...

20:00.961 --> 20:02.028
Oh, hey, Amy.

20:02.030 --> 20:03.029
Bernadette just texted me.

20:03.031 --> 20:04.497
Howard proposed?

20:04.499 --> 20:06.098
Yes, not important.
Just stopped by

20:06.100 --> 20:07.717
to let you know I'm
getting orthotics.

20:07.719 --> 20:09.035
Also, I'm carrying
Sheldon's baby.

20:09.037 --> 20:10.202
Mum's the word.

20:16.543 --> 20:19.612
You're pregnant?!

20:20.887 --> 20:23.721
Wow. Is there anything
on there about orthotics?
