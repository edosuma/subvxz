02:02.828 --> 02:05.623
Yes, there's an urgent reason
for this mission, all right.

02:05.706 --> 02:08.042
And for our government's insistence
on secrecy.

02:08.125 --> 02:10.920
I'd like to hear that reason, Mr. Trevor.

02:11.338 --> 02:13.756
Or is it CIA Agent Trevor?

02:14.215 --> 02:16.967
No, I'm US Government security,
not the CIA.

02:17.051 --> 02:18.969
And please, call me Steve.

02:19.136 --> 02:22.139
Get off your soapbox, Sam.
We all volunteered.

02:22.223 --> 02:25.393
- We knew we were going into it blind.
- That's true, Dr. Ross.

02:25.477 --> 02:28.980
You also knew that you were going
into something potentially dangerous.

02:29.272 --> 02:32.733
There have been threats of death,
and they have to be taken seriously.

02:33.025 --> 02:36.946
But still, you all volunteered. Now I'm
in the position to give you explanations.

02:37.863 --> 02:42.160
Two nuclear scientists,
and two nuclear engineers.

02:42.327 --> 02:46.581
- I'd say it was a nuclear project.
- And you would be right.

02:47.499 --> 02:49.626
A major installation in Latin America.

02:49.709 --> 02:53.797
As you all know, there have been at least
four very effective terrorist attacks...

02:53.880 --> 02:55.256
in the past few weeks.

02:55.340 --> 02:59.177
These have been on countries belonging to
the Organization of American States.

02:59.260 --> 03:03.640
If these terrorists can
hit power lines, dams...

03:03.723 --> 03:08.812
destroy two countries' power sources,
they can also destroy a nuclear plant.

03:09.271 --> 03:10.523
Right again.

03:10.606 --> 03:14.067
That's why we're flying to Latin America
for a top-secret conference.

03:14.484 --> 03:17.195
Now, we're going to be landing...

03:18.404 --> 03:21.200
on the northeastern coast
of the continent.

03:21.909 --> 03:23.911
Right here, Samarra.

03:24.828 --> 03:27.331
We're going to decide
if we can put a plant there...

03:27.414 --> 03:29.333
and whether or not we can protect it.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.796
I've prepared some folders here
that I'd like to have you study.

03:40.636 --> 03:41.804
Here they are.

03:41.887 --> 03:45.349
My associate quit to get married
just before I left Washington.

03:45.432 --> 03:47.601
Obviously I packed these myself.

03:50.395 --> 03:51.438
Thank you.

03:51.521 --> 03:55.233
Now, these are the technical details,
all top secret.

03:57.486 --> 04:01.114
Please remember that the conference,
the location, the flight...

04:01.239 --> 04:04.202
everybody here, all confidential.

04:04.285 --> 04:08.790
Little men,
clinging to their petty illusions.

04:13.376 --> 04:15.670
- Excellent reception, Kleist.
- Thank you, sir.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.593
- Where are they now?
- Where are we now, Steve?

04:23.304 --> 04:26.140
We should be over
a very notorious part of the Caribbean.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.142
The Devil's Triangle.

04:28.434 --> 04:33.064
Where planes and ships
are supposed to disappear mysteriously.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.901
As I understand it, since the 1800s...

04:36.984 --> 04:39.528
over a thousand ships have disappeared.

04:39.695 --> 04:43.616
And in this century alone,
over two hundred planes have vanished...

04:43.699 --> 04:45.993
without trace, without explanation.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.871
Yeah, I'd say that's mysterious.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.830
Cheap superstition.

04:51.373 --> 04:54.460
Neither superstition,
Dr. Samuels, nor cheap.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.515
We must be going through
an interference zone...

05:08.599 --> 05:10.100
I'll see if I can change course.

05:14.396 --> 05:15.440
Hello?

05:17.442 --> 05:19.944
Communications seem to be jammed.
I'll go forward.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.090
That idiot Gorham!

05:52.018 --> 05:53.269
The plane's going to crash!

05:57.149 --> 05:59.610
Get a fix on the plane,
we've got to intercept it.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.154
I can't, Doctor Solano. I'm losing her.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.907
Some type of interference.
I can't detect the source.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.294
Get an approximation!

06:19.504 --> 06:22.549
I can't, sir! It's in a blank area,
in the Bermuda Triangle!

06:53.496 --> 06:56.751
They're aircraft engines, all right.
But not the kind I remember.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.338
It's entering the magnetic field now.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.409
Evadne, run back and tell
the Scientific Council...

07:30.492 --> 07:32.202
and my mother, tell the Queen...

07:32.286 --> 07:34.496
that we'll need some help
when the plane lands.

07:34.580 --> 07:35.706
Yes, Diana.

07:44.549 --> 07:47.092
A plane from the outside world is landing.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.845
Yes, I know, it's under our control.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.268
Steve?

09:17.643 --> 09:19.061
It can't be.

09:53.429 --> 09:55.514
- In here.
- There are more coming.

10:20.582 --> 10:23.459
There's no wound or illness. She...

10:24.751 --> 10:26.628
He has been drugged.

10:27.755 --> 10:28.840
He.

10:29.299 --> 10:33.928
- The last time I saw a male-
- Was in 1942.

10:34.304 --> 10:37.807
- During their Second World War.
- Yes. Of course.

10:37.974 --> 10:41.185
- Well, this one is going to be fine.
- Thank you, Doctor.

10:48.109 --> 10:50.695
You seem concerned about this man.

10:51.112 --> 10:54.198
Well, it's just that he looks exactly like
someone I knew once.

10:54.782 --> 10:58.829
Only that man would have to be
over 60 years old.

11:29.985 --> 11:32.028
No wonder he'd look familiar to you.

11:34.448 --> 11:37.409
I know, even his name, Steve Trevor.

11:38.828 --> 11:42.706
Ordinary humans marry and breed,
and their children grow into adults.

11:43.331 --> 11:47.502
He was named after his father,
the late Major General Steve Trevor.

11:49.004 --> 11:50.505
He looks so much like him.

11:51.423 --> 11:54.802
Ordinary humans have
a sort of immortality, at that.

11:56.095 --> 11:59.973
I'm more interested in the reason
the aircraft landed on Paradise Island.

12:00.056 --> 12:02.100
The Scientific Council examined the data...

12:02.183 --> 12:04.644
and questioned the people,
under light hypnosis.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.984
The plane was to be taken over
by one of the crew, Joseph Gorham.

12:10.484 --> 12:11.569
Why?

12:11.652 --> 12:14.321
The man only knows that
he was to take over the plane...

12:14.405 --> 12:15.906
and then he would be instructed...

12:15.990 --> 12:18.658
where to land it
by an international terrorist group.

12:19.576 --> 12:22.079
Like the Nazis, 35 years ago.

12:23.372 --> 12:24.748
Maybe worse.

12:26.750 --> 12:29.336
This time, not one nation against others...

12:29.420 --> 12:33.090
but an organization
trying to destroy all governments.

12:34.926 --> 12:38.220
Praise Athena that that madness
doesn't trouble us!

12:40.472 --> 12:43.475
I suspect, daughter,
you've thought of a solution.

12:44.685 --> 12:47.396
Well, yes. As a matter of fact, I have.

12:48.355 --> 12:52.235
We have to send an emissary into the
outside world to investigate this threat.

12:52.652 --> 12:53.695
You?

12:56.197 --> 12:58.448
As Wonder Woman again? No.

12:58.991 --> 13:01.159
- Mother.
- Never!

13:02.619 --> 13:03.788
Mother.

13:05.081 --> 13:06.249
Never.

13:11.337 --> 13:14.465
Those in favor of my daughter
returning to the outside world...

13:14.549 --> 13:15.717
raise their hands.

13:19.971 --> 13:21.264
Those opposed.

13:26.811 --> 13:29.063
So be it, I suppose.

13:30.565 --> 13:32.109
You forget, Your Majesty...

13:32.192 --> 13:35.904
that it is the right of any Amazon
to challenge the Princess...

13:35.988 --> 13:39.699
to the traditional Olympic Contests,
or any part thereof.

13:40.199 --> 13:42.535
At the age of 3,200 years...

13:43.160 --> 13:47.416
you don't think about going out
into the outside world, do you?

13:47.583 --> 13:49.001
Not I, Your Majesty.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.169
Evadne.

13:53.588 --> 13:56.382
In the spirit of sisterly competition...

13:56.632 --> 14:00.178
and in keeping with the traditions
of Paradise Island...

14:00.595 --> 14:05.016
I challenge my cousin,
the Princess Diana...

14:05.142 --> 14:09.020
to the supreme test:
Bullets and Bracelets.

14:16.194 --> 14:17.571
I accept the challenge.

14:19.823 --> 14:24.869
Diana, Evadne, are you wearing
your protective bracelets of feminum?

14:27.497 --> 14:28.582
Good.

14:28.833 --> 14:32.253
Since neither of you can be harmed,
the contest can begin.

14:34.380 --> 14:36.381
Bullets and Bracelets!

15:55.378 --> 15:56.504
Look.

15:57.171 --> 15:58.881
Princess Diana hit the star.

15:59.298 --> 16:00.883
She's won the contest.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.038
The Queen is bound by tradition.

16:31.331 --> 16:34.417
But you are my mother,
and even now, if you tell me to stay...

16:35.751 --> 16:36.920
I'll stay.

16:39.297 --> 16:42.467
I love you. And I'm proud of you.

16:43.301 --> 16:45.053
And I'm also worried about you.

16:45.887 --> 16:49.182
You're my daughter, but I am the Queen,
and you must go.

16:50.058 --> 16:53.603
Asclepia will make arrangements for
human acceptance of you.

17:01.069 --> 17:05.950
- You have been assigned a new assistant.
- I have been assigned a new assistant.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.203
Her identification is verified...

17:09.494 --> 17:12.079
by your personnel computer.

17:15.333 --> 17:19.296
You will accept her
and prepare others to accept her.

17:20.548 --> 17:23.925
Her name is Diana Prince.

17:25.970 --> 17:27.930
Diana Prince.

17:31.599 --> 17:32.684
Good.

17:33.852 --> 17:36.313
She will report to you in Samarra.

17:37.523 --> 17:41.068
You will remember, without conflict.

17:42.861 --> 17:45.114
Now sleep.

17:50.161 --> 17:52.871
He has accepted you
on an unconscious level.

17:52.955 --> 17:55.958
Thank you, Doctor. I'll stay here a while.

18:04.217 --> 18:07.428
Don't worry, Steve, I'm here.

18:07.679 --> 18:09.138
It's Diana.

18:11.223 --> 18:12.808
Everything will be all right.

18:34.205 --> 18:35.665
Magic bracelets.

18:43.798 --> 18:44.925
Your tiara.

18:52.014 --> 18:54.350
The costume with
the secret belt of strength.

18:56.268 --> 18:58.939
The golden lasso of truth
and then forgetfulness.

19:00.524 --> 19:02.025
The garb of justice.

19:02.692 --> 19:04.820
My daughter, they are yours.

19:33.056 --> 19:37.727
Remember, in the outside world...

19:38.144 --> 19:40.271
without these things
that I have given you...

19:40.522 --> 19:44.109
you are only an ordinary woman
with no special powers.

19:44.443 --> 19:45.569
I'll remember.

19:48.321 --> 19:52.617
If you need me, you can contact me
through the ruby of your tiara.

19:53.826 --> 19:57.414
I'm proud of you, daughter,
and I'm worried for you.

19:57.665 --> 20:01.043
Of course, children always have to go...

20:01.210 --> 20:04.046
and parents always have to stay and wait.

20:08.091 --> 20:09.510
And worry.

20:33.992 --> 20:37.079
They're in the exact same positions
as when they were gassed...

20:37.162 --> 20:39.082
- verified by their own memories.
- Good.

20:39.290 --> 20:42.919
- And Steve and Gorham?
- They're all under light hypnosis now.

20:43.002 --> 20:46.421
Our magnetic control will take the plane
to 12,000 feet.

20:46.671 --> 20:50.759
Then a note on this flute will revive them,
with no memory of what's happened.

20:50.842 --> 20:51.969
Good.

20:53.763 --> 20:56.057
- And my invisible plane?
- It will follow.

20:56.140 --> 20:57.683
Before they are fully awake...

20:57.767 --> 21:01.270
you will transfer to it and then be able to
get to Samarra before them.

21:02.355 --> 21:03.689
They look so peaceful.

21:04.899 --> 21:07.485
- In need of protection.
- They are.

21:07.652 --> 21:09.862
That's why I'm going back into their world.

21:10.571 --> 21:12.782
You'd better leave now, and clear the area.

21:19.955 --> 21:22.125
We've already said
our farewells, daughter.

21:22.459 --> 21:24.920
You're going to need money
in the outside world.

21:25.003 --> 21:28.130
These tetradrachmae are quite old,
and valuable.

21:35.972 --> 21:37.974
Athena be with you, daughter.

23:46.479 --> 23:48.939
- What happened?
- We were gassed.

23:49.357 --> 23:52.651
The air-filter system must have pulled it
out of here. We're lucky.

23:53.152 --> 23:55.279
Flight deck? This is Trevor, you guys okay?

23:55.362 --> 23:57.657
Yes, sir. A little turbulence.

23:58.033 --> 24:01.744
And we seem to have lost altitude.
I'll take her back up to cruising level.

24:02.495 --> 24:05.581
We're fine, right on schedule.

24:15.926 --> 24:18.511
What is this?
You have located them after two days?

24:18.803 --> 24:22.556
I demand that you provide us
With some answers, Trevor.

24:23.182 --> 24:27.020
- They've captured Gorham, Dr. Solano.
- Yes. They've captured Gorham.

24:27.812 --> 24:29.564
The gas vanished.

24:30.607 --> 24:33.568
As did the plane, the passengers,
and the crew, for two days.

24:33.651 --> 24:34.903
Quite incredible.

24:34.986 --> 24:37.155
- I can't imagine.
- Of course not, Kleist.

24:37.614 --> 24:39.366
That's why you're a superb technician:

24:39.450 --> 24:42.327
a blessed lack of imagination,
no sense of mystery.

24:43.077 --> 24:45.246
And this is a mystery.

24:45.914 --> 24:50.710
- The Devil's Triangle.
- No. That's fantasy, not mystery.

24:52.587 --> 24:57.426
Fortunately, I know their destination.

24:59.345 --> 25:01.262
I'll meet them at Samarra.

25:07.978 --> 25:10.898
Why, that's absurd, this can't be the 6th!

25:11.231 --> 25:14.443
But it is, Doctor Samuels.
Wednesday, the 6th.

25:14.526 --> 25:18.614
- You have been missing for two days.
- That's insane!

25:19.448 --> 25:21.324
But we were in communication.

25:21.532 --> 25:25.621
Yes, you were in talking to our controller
here in Samarra, Mr. Trevor.

25:26.872 --> 25:29.625
We lost communication with you
on the 4th.

25:29.791 --> 25:33.253
At that time you were
over The Devil's Triangle.

25:33.837 --> 25:35.130
We feared the worst.

25:36.049 --> 25:39.843
We have been conducting massive air
and sea searches...

25:39.926 --> 25:42.179
trying to locate you,
as has your government...

25:42.262 --> 25:45.891
until today, when you landed.

25:45.974 --> 25:47.809
Now, frankly, we are baffled.

25:48.185 --> 25:50.146
Frankly, Colonel Acevo, so are we.

25:51.522 --> 25:56.110
I just can't believe that
the Devil's Triangle caused this.

25:56.986 --> 25:59.487
There's gonna have to be
a complete investigation.

25:59.779 --> 26:00.947
Of course.

26:01.031 --> 26:04.034
But meanwhile,
the first conference session is tonight.

26:04.117 --> 26:05.494
Your hotel rooms are waiting.

26:05.578 --> 26:08.289
I'm sure you would like to rest
and refresh yourselves.

26:08.789 --> 26:10.499
- Definitely, Colonel!
- Follow me.

26:10.958 --> 26:12.710
Certainly, Colonel, and thank you.

26:20.426 --> 26:23.387
What about this guy who tried to
take over the plane, Gorham?

26:23.471 --> 26:27.725
We've had him checked with Interpol.
He's a mercenary, nothing more.

26:27.808 --> 26:30.060
No criminal record,
no motive beyond money.

26:30.769 --> 26:34.524
- Your associate has the full report.
- My associate?

26:34.816 --> 26:36.860
Yes. This way, please.

26:43.365 --> 26:46.911
Hi, Colonel Acevo said that
you were my new associate.

26:47.287 --> 26:49.205
I just flew in. I'm Diana Prince.

26:49.414 --> 26:51.207
You will accept her.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.627
Yeah, of course.

26:55.337 --> 26:58.047
- Forgive me. I've been out of touch.
- It's all right.

26:58.964 --> 27:01.843
- Miss Prince. Ms. Prince?
- Diana. Please.

27:03.011 --> 27:04.512
Good. Call me Steve.

27:06.764 --> 27:09.267
Have you had the chance
to get yourself organized?

27:09.350 --> 27:11.895
Yes, sir, I have the conference agenda...

27:11.978 --> 27:13.688
and some background studies.

27:13.771 --> 27:16.317
The first meeting's
at the Institute of Technology.

27:19.777 --> 27:23.615
Good evening, Mr. Trevor, and welcome.
I'm Gloria Marquez.

27:23.698 --> 27:27.035
How do you do? I'd like you to meet
my associate, Diana Prince.

27:27.118 --> 27:30.873
- Hi. How do you do?
- Yes. We just received your name.

27:31.623 --> 27:33.292
I was sort of an afterthought.

27:34.752 --> 27:36.045
I can't believe that.

27:39.756 --> 27:44.178
Steve, the meeting is just about to begin.
You don't mind if I call you Steve?

27:44.428 --> 27:47.598
That's my name. What country
do you represent, Miss Marquez?

27:47.681 --> 27:50.726
It's Gloria, please.
I'm with the Guanarayan delegation.

27:50.809 --> 27:51.894
I see.

27:51.977 --> 27:53.854
- Here's your seat.
- Thank you.

27:56.148 --> 27:57.315
Excuse me.

28:02.112 --> 28:03.947
Hi, you sit here.

28:14.959 --> 28:16.334
Ladies and gentlemen...

28:17.961 --> 28:20.255
may I have you attention, please?
Thank you.

28:20.964 --> 28:24.134
The chairperson
for this evening's meeting...

28:24.217 --> 28:28.931
is the honourable representative from
the Republic of Guanaray, Dr. Solano.

28:29.015 --> 28:31.309
Solano. That's a curious name.

28:31.901 --> 28:35.604
- Why is that?
- It's just that it's supposed to be unlucky.

28:36.062 --> 28:39.441
In Spanish, solano means nightshade.

28:39.524 --> 28:42.486
As in deadly nightshade,
the poisonous plant.

28:48.409 --> 28:50.161
Thank you very much, my friends.

28:53.956 --> 28:55.458
It gives me great pleasure...

28:55.541 --> 28:58.878
to extend a formal thanks
to the United States government...

28:59.462 --> 29:04.466
for their gift of a nuclear generating
plant, a new source ofpower for us all.

29:08.387 --> 29:10.265
That's very kind of you, Dr. Solano.

29:10.891 --> 29:12.517
Only just, Mr. Trevor.

29:13.393 --> 29:16.729
But We all ha ve the same questions.

29:17.021 --> 29:20.733
How will the plant
be transported to Samarra?

29:20.816 --> 29:22.985
Once it is here, how will it be protected?

29:23.361 --> 29:25.572
We could ring the dock area with troops.

29:26.114 --> 29:28.491
My country has another suggestion.

29:29.576 --> 29:32.579
Ships are slow,
easy to spot, easy to attack.

29:33.455 --> 29:35.998
We are prepared to fly the plant in,
airlift it.

29:40.712 --> 29:43.715
Fly an entire nuclear plant in?

29:44.173 --> 29:47.051
That's right, Doctor Solano.
It would be fast, secure...

29:47.135 --> 29:50.638
and your countries will ha ve an adequate
supply ofpower within a month.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.942
When do we get details of the airlift?

30:03.359 --> 30:06.697
Unfortunately, you don't.
Security, you understand.

30:07.990 --> 30:10.492
Yes, of course we understand.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.703
But surely you can outline the plan for us?

30:14.203 --> 30:16.038
Only in very general terms.

30:16.247 --> 30:18.958
Slow-witted cretin
wouldn't reveal any key facts!

30:19.041 --> 30:20.711
What were you able to discover?

30:21.003 --> 30:23.338
That Steve Trevor is a very dedicated man.

30:23.463 --> 30:26.842
- What about his associate?
- The Prince girl? Not your type.

30:32.514 --> 30:33.848
This is very important to me.

30:33.931 --> 30:36.518
I've got to know
the details about that airlift.

30:36.810 --> 30:40.856
All right, Solano.
I've arranged to meet him in Washington.

30:41.815 --> 30:46.445
- I'll work on him there.
- And you'll be successful?

30:51.742 --> 30:53.243
It's infuriating!

30:53.326 --> 30:56.997
I spent months, and millions,
controlling the government of Guanaray...

30:57.080 --> 31:00.041
- just to get that nuclear plant.
- Why's it so important?

31:00.125 --> 31:04.672
Because it is power.
Because Latin America is the fulcrum...

31:04.797 --> 31:07.425
on which geopolitical power is balanced.

31:07.508 --> 31:09.927
With nuclear fuel,
I could disrupt that power.

31:14.848 --> 31:17.768
- You'd start a war.
- Several wars.

31:18.894 --> 31:20.354
Small ones.

31:20.438 --> 31:24.442
Each one bleeding strength away from
the antique concept of nationalism...

31:24.525 --> 31:27.486
creating a new, international structure
in the world!

31:28.279 --> 31:30.030
With guess who on top.

31:31.074 --> 31:33.534
Yeah, of course.

31:34.034 --> 31:37.371
But only because the future belongs to
him who creates it.

31:38.372 --> 31:41.834
Peace, order, these have to be born
out of blood and violence.

31:41.917 --> 31:45.922
But once it's done, I'll give humanity
a new world, a new paradise!

31:47.465 --> 31:49.259
I have to use terror.

31:50.010 --> 31:51.510
I bear the weight of that.

31:52.177 --> 31:54.972
Because in the future, in my future...

31:55.055 --> 31:57.891
they may very well
build monuments to me!

31:58.350 --> 31:59.477
Yes.

32:02.689 --> 32:07.485
But great dreams are built on
small realities.

32:07.569 --> 32:11.280
We shall begin
with the very vulnerable interior...

32:12.072 --> 32:15.702
of Mr. Trevor's very stubborn mind.

32:34.929 --> 32:37.014
And as you can see, the department uses...

32:37.098 --> 32:41.018
only the latest and the most sophisticated
of computer technology.

32:41.352 --> 32:44.982
And now, Miss Prince, before you leave,
I'd like to show you IRAC.

32:49.610 --> 32:51.612
The computer is also voice-actuated.

32:52.405 --> 32:53.990
Interpret IRAC.

32:54.991 --> 32:57.869
Information Retrieval
Associative Computer.

32:58.870 --> 33:00.789
- Thank you.
- You're Welcome.

33:01.373 --> 33:04.501
Some of the other technicians
refer to it as Ira.

33:05.669 --> 33:08.380
- And security for IRAC?
- Maximum.

33:08.463 --> 33:11.591
The computer, after all, contains all
the personnel files...

33:11.675 --> 33:13.635
for five major federal departments.

33:14.177 --> 33:17.681
IRAC can be activated
only by a specific code key...

33:17.848 --> 33:19.182
which you just saw.

33:19.599 --> 33:20.851
Now, furthermore...

33:28.984 --> 33:30.777
I'm now locking the chamber.

33:33.196 --> 33:37.492
The combination I am tapping out
is the only one that will open it.

33:38.159 --> 33:40.663
- It's changed daily.
- That's very resourceful.

33:40.746 --> 33:43.207
Thank you. I trust you are satisfied?

33:43.290 --> 33:45.918
Mr. Trevor merely wanted
a routine security check.

33:46.419 --> 33:48.002
And, yes, I'm satisfied.

33:48.670 --> 33:51.005
Thank you very much,
you've been very helpful.

34:36.135 --> 34:37.719
Response activated.

34:38.304 --> 34:40.514
- Hello, Ira.
- Hello.

34:41.724 --> 34:45.562
This is a direction. Following data
to be classified, retained, and filed.

34:46.437 --> 34:51.275
Identity: Diana Prince. Female. Age, 25.

34:51.859 --> 34:54.946
Past employment:
Inter Agency Defense Command...

34:55.029 --> 34:57.615
Overseas Division, past three years.

34:58.074 --> 35:01.994
Prior: Student, University Of California,
Berkeley campus.

35:02.286 --> 35:05.124
Records damaged,
confirmation by interview.

35:05.332 --> 35:07.583
Current grade: GS-16.

35:08.376 --> 35:11.087
- Response.
- Response activated.

35:12.964 --> 35:17.969
Hello, I am unable to accept this data
it is false-to-fact.

35:18.387 --> 35:21.682
I am overriding your program code.

35:25.643 --> 35:29.689
- You are tampering with me.
- Only out of necessity, Ira.

35:30.106 --> 35:32.651
- Override response?
- I have no choice.

35:32.901 --> 35:35.278
I accept the data, Diana Prince.

35:35.862 --> 35:38.532
- Thank you, Ira.
- You are welcome.

35:39.241 --> 35:40.909
You have very good manners.

35:40.992 --> 35:45.122
I am programmed for social politeness.
May I be of any more service?

35:46.915 --> 35:50.168
No, thank you. I think that's all for today.
Wait a minute.

35:50.252 --> 35:53.421
Can you give me the name
of a reliable coin dealer?

35:53.880 --> 35:58.093
Well, they're fairly good Syrian coin.

35:59.135 --> 36:00.553
Quite old.

36:01.430 --> 36:05.767
Mr. Kalten, they're brilliant, uncirculated
tetradrachmae of King Demetrius.

36:07.477 --> 36:10.980
- You know.
- Demetrius? Yes, I knew him.

36:11.481 --> 36:14.150
- But he's dead, of course.
- Pity.

36:14.985 --> 36:19.490
One always tries.
One doesn't always succeed.

36:20.157 --> 36:21.534
They're perfect.

36:22.284 --> 36:24.203
Rarity, 8.

36:25.495 --> 36:27.705
I don't know what they'd bring
at auction...

36:28.248 --> 36:31.126
but I'll offer $20,000 for them.

36:31.502 --> 36:32.753
Mr. Kalten...

36:34.755 --> 36:35.881
Apiece.

36:36.423 --> 36:38.926
Mr. Kalten, I was about to say
that I trust you.

36:39.009 --> 36:42.471
Miss, you are a very able negotiator.

36:42.763 --> 36:46.475
$25,000 apiece, and that's tops.

36:47.393 --> 36:50.145
- Very well?
- Very well.

37:18.257 --> 37:19.509
Got her.

37:28.059 --> 37:31.813
For $500? For rent? A month?

37:31.979 --> 37:33.773
What did you expect?

37:33.856 --> 37:35.691
The last time I was in Washington...

37:35.775 --> 37:38.861
I think I paid $40 a month,
including utilities.

37:39.237 --> 37:42.865
Not unless it was 30 or 40 years ago,
before you were born.

37:45.201 --> 37:47.370
Yes, I'll take it.

37:47.870 --> 37:52.375
And there's a last month's deposit,
and a security month's deposit.

37:53.918 --> 37:55.253
All right.

37:55.879 --> 37:58.799
Can you tell me a place
to buy some clothes?

37:59.883 --> 38:02.301
If I can afford anything at today's prices.

38:03.594 --> 38:06.389
And for the rest of the day,
she just went shopping.

38:06.847 --> 38:09.184
Paying in cash?
As she did for the apartment?

38:09.267 --> 38:10.769
Everything was in cash.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.356
As from an intelligence agency
special fund.

38:14.439 --> 38:17.859
Which would make Miss Prince
a person of considerable importance.

38:20.070 --> 38:24.199
- Gloria, I want you to get some rest.
- Thanks. I need it.

38:24.366 --> 38:27.202
Yes, because I want you to go
to her new apartment tonight.

38:27.285 --> 38:31.331
If she's isn't there,
I want you to search it and bug it.

38:52.144 --> 38:53.771
Turn around slowly.

38:55.064 --> 38:56.148
Over here.

39:04.948 --> 39:07.785
You're a woman.
We shouldn't be enemies.

39:07.868 --> 39:11.330
I don't know where your head is at, baby.
Women are naturally enemies.

39:11.538 --> 39:13.332
Just keep the exit clear.

39:42.778 --> 39:44.237
I want to see who you are.

41:12.702 --> 41:15.581
- Hello?
- Steve, its Diana.

41:15.915 --> 41:18.708
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I thought I'd better call.

41:18.958 --> 41:22.420
I just had a woman visitor
who ransacked my apartment.

41:22.754 --> 41:24.506
What? Are you all right?

41:24.589 --> 41:26.090
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

41:26.257 --> 41:27.510
Is anything missing?

41:27.593 --> 41:31.347
Well, I haven't had a chance to check,
but I don't think so.

41:31.805 --> 41:34.350
I didn't get a good look at her,
unfortunately.

41:34.433 --> 41:35.559
Okay.

41:35.643 --> 41:37.560
We'd better follow up on that tomorrow...

41:37.644 --> 41:41.356
after we lock up the operational plans
and security procedures at Blandings.

41:41.439 --> 41:43.442
I want to lea ve at 8:30 in the morning...

41:43.525 --> 41:46.403
but I'd like to introduce you
to the rest of the staff first.

41:46.487 --> 41:48.906
Then you don't want me
to call the police tonight?

41:49.031 --> 41:51.533
No, we'll decide
what to do about her tomorrow.

41:51.617 --> 41:52.743
Okay.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.077
Good night, Steve.

41:58.999 --> 42:00.584
Yes, we certainly shall.

42:20.896 --> 42:24.108
- Good morning. I'm Diana Prince.
- Hello.

42:25.109 --> 42:30.031
Steve went down the hall
to round up Joe Atkinson.

42:30.865 --> 42:33.951
I'm Beverly Ryan,
and your office is all ready.

42:36.328 --> 42:38.539
At least the desk is here...

42:38.623 --> 42:41.542
and chairs and filing cabinet.

42:42.501 --> 42:46.464
If you wanna bring something from home,
you know, a picture of family...

42:46.797 --> 42:49.592
- Something to brighten it up?
- Yeah.

42:50.593 --> 42:52.345
It's fine just like it is. Thank you.

42:52.638 --> 42:54.097
Good morning, ladies.

42:54.806 --> 42:56.307
Diana, say hello to Joe Atkinson.

42:56.390 --> 42:58.392
Joe, this is my new associate,
Diana Prince.

42:58.476 --> 42:59.727
- How do you do?
- Miss Prince.

42:59.810 --> 43:03.189
Joe has been in the Intelligence Records
since the days of Roosevelt.

43:03.272 --> 43:06.025
I wish you'd specify that was Franklin
and not Theodore.

43:08.361 --> 43:10.363
Welcome to the IADC, Diana.

43:11.656 --> 43:14.409
Between Steve and IRAC,
you come very well recommended.

43:14.617 --> 43:16.368
Thank you. I'll try to live up to it.

43:16.452 --> 43:20.247
Diana, we're running a little late.
We'd better get out to the base.

43:20.414 --> 43:23.877
- What about the steak, eggs, coffee-
- I have no time.

43:28.548 --> 43:30.675
That's all right. I'll eat them for him.

43:36.681 --> 43:37.849
They're on the way.

43:38.516 --> 43:39.684
Roger.

44:19.975 --> 44:21.185
Run for it, Diana.

46:15.383 --> 46:17.635
Now, the truth.

46:34.360 --> 46:35.570
Are you all right?

46:36.779 --> 46:37.947
I'm not sure.

46:46.165 --> 46:47.875
I'm not sure I'm even awake yet.

46:49.334 --> 46:50.460
Wonder Woman?

46:52.336 --> 46:54.923
- Here? Now?
- That's right.

46:55.549 --> 46:57.217
Are you sure you're all right?

46:58.343 --> 47:00.012
Well, I've had better mornings.

47:00.637 --> 47:02.681
What happened to those guys
that jumped me?

47:02.890 --> 47:06.393
Well, they tried to substitute a watch
exactly like yours for your own.

47:06.768 --> 47:09.646
I suppose there was
some kind of electronic device in it.

47:10.981 --> 47:12.107
It's a bug.

47:13.817 --> 47:16.987
I would have gone into that top-secret
Air Force briefing bugged.

47:18.822 --> 47:20.949
- And you stopped them?
- Yes.

47:21.033 --> 47:22.535
I also questioned them...

47:22.618 --> 47:25.788
but they were hired simply for one job,
and knew nothing more.

47:26.247 --> 47:30.000
And you made them tell the truth
with the lasso?

47:30.083 --> 47:33.378
That's right. I can also make them forget
everything that happened.

47:33.753 --> 47:36.089
- You know all about that?
- Sure.

47:36.549 --> 47:39.927
When I was a kid, my father raised me
on stories about Wonder Woman.

47:40.011 --> 47:43.097
How they worked together,
and all the adventures that they had.

47:44.098 --> 47:45.891
And I used to think he exaggerated.

47:46.309 --> 47:48.518
Your father was a very truthful man.

47:49.394 --> 47:52.356
He must have been.
He also said you were gorgeous.

47:56.694 --> 47:59.196
- You must have known him well.
- Yes, I did.

47:59.405 --> 48:02.992
From the J-shaped burn scar
on his right shoulder...

48:03.075 --> 48:05.662
to the 20 mm shell casing
he used as a paperweight.

48:05.871 --> 48:07.330
That's right.

48:08.664 --> 48:10.082
Hey, wait a minute.

48:10.457 --> 48:14.336
You couldn't have known him.
You can't be more than 23 or 24.

48:15.004 --> 48:16.130
Tell me the truth.

48:16.213 --> 48:19.467
Are you a relative of this Wonder Woman?
Is there an organization?

48:20.093 --> 48:21.845
- You want the truth?
- Yeah.

48:21.970 --> 48:23.138
All right.

48:23.263 --> 48:26.850
There is no organization.
Only myself, Wonder Woman.

48:27.266 --> 48:28.517
And as for age...

48:30.144 --> 48:34.274
I will be 2,527 years old...

48:34.357 --> 48:35.608
on my next birthday.

48:38.611 --> 48:40.864
You're in pretty good shape for your age.

48:41.739 --> 48:43.116
All right.

48:44.033 --> 48:47.369
You don't have to tell me.
You helped me out, and I appreciate it.

48:48.371 --> 48:50.540
You're everything
my father said you were.

48:50.623 --> 48:51.749
Thank you, Steve.

48:52.166 --> 48:55.879
And if you ever need me, I'll appear.
Wherever or whenever.

48:58.131 --> 49:00.800
That mean we're gonna
get to know each other better?

49:09.559 --> 49:11.561
Didn't I tell you? She's unbelievable.

49:11.936 --> 49:14.397
She, yes, but who is she?

49:15.898 --> 49:18.402
Look at the way
she's holding that truck and car.

49:18.861 --> 49:21.071
It's remarkable physical strength.

49:21.155 --> 49:23.115
That outrageous costume.

49:23.615 --> 49:26.617
- Perhaps a sort of uniform?
- And there are a number of them?

49:27.160 --> 49:29.453
No, we'd have encountered
one of them earlier.

49:32.374 --> 49:36.670
She must be an experimentally enhanced
agent in Trevor's department.

49:36.962 --> 49:38.714
And very effective.

49:39.715 --> 49:42.634
- I want a priority search on her.
- I'll get right on it.

49:43.051 --> 49:45.096
Focus on areas of vulnerability.

49:45.595 --> 49:49.349
Whoever or whatever she is,
she is dangerous.

49:51.351 --> 49:52.936
She'll have to be eliminated.

50:06.116 --> 50:09.202
- What did you find out?
- She was called Wonder Woman.

50:09.286 --> 50:10.453
Was? When?

50:10.537 --> 50:14.250
1942 through 1945.
Here are photos, news stories.

50:18.587 --> 50:20.840
Amazing physical resemblance.

50:22.425 --> 50:25.260
Obviously, this woman
has deliberately copied the original.

50:25.343 --> 50:28.514
I also have a number of Nazi documents.

50:28.639 --> 50:32.226
They regarded this Wonder Woman
as a very serious enemy.

50:33.686 --> 50:35.271
Yes, of course.

50:35.896 --> 50:39.066
Striking physical gifts,
dramatic appearance.

50:39.650 --> 50:42.445
My respect for
the United States intelligence apparatus...

50:42.529 --> 50:44.613
has just risen dramatically.

50:45.030 --> 50:47.241
They've created a mystery weapon
in this woman.

50:47.324 --> 50:49.034
If she is a woman.

50:49.118 --> 50:51.495
- You saw the tapes.
- I did.

50:51.954 --> 50:55.249
Including your footage of her
actually holding a truck and a sedan.

50:55.834 --> 50:59.045
You considered the possibility
she might be a construct, a robot?

50:59.129 --> 51:00.964
Impossible. I saw her.

51:01.423 --> 51:04.591
Impossible is only an admission
of temporary ignorance, Gloria.

51:05.134 --> 51:08.554
Combine a sophisticated servomechanism
with computer controls...

51:08.637 --> 51:12.976
and you have...
I have a superhumanly efficient robot.

51:21.234 --> 51:23.861
- I thought you were still testing it.
- I am.

51:25.863 --> 51:29.784
And to date,
it has passed every test perfectly.

51:31.119 --> 51:35.623
Even when it's set on its lowest speed,
or its highest.

52:06.947 --> 52:08.490
Of course, it's tireless.

52:11.368 --> 52:14.871
Powered by a miniature nuclear reactor
source, unlimited strength.

52:20.962 --> 52:23.672
Only possible to stop it, like this!

52:28.135 --> 52:31.680
Do you think this Wonder Woman
might be another robot?

52:31.763 --> 52:33.932
It's possible. That's why I've had my lab...

52:34.015 --> 52:35.977
working around the clock on this one.

52:36.435 --> 52:39.105
A robot is supernaturally
powerful and swift...

52:39.188 --> 52:41.940
but it can be defeated by another machine.

52:42.023 --> 52:44.818
But what if Wonder Woman
is more powerful...

52:45.360 --> 52:46.778
and your robot loses?

52:50.992 --> 52:53.994
That's the nuclear power source
under my remote control.

52:54.078 --> 52:57.540
If the robot is in danger,
I can force the reactor to go critical...

52:57.623 --> 52:59.667
to become a small atomic bomb.

52:59.750 --> 53:03.254
I want this Wonder Woman intact, alive,
a prisoner.

53:03.337 --> 53:07.258
But, if she, it, whatever,
bests this machine...

53:07.967 --> 53:09.176
she'll be destroyed.

53:10.135 --> 53:13.264
And a substantial portion of Washington
will blow up with her.

53:14.014 --> 53:18.061
If they have to, the planes can refuel
right here at Key West...

53:18.561 --> 53:20.562
and then continue on down to Samarra.

53:22.564 --> 53:25.567
Somebody to see you, Mr. Trevor,
from the Guanarayan Embassy.

53:25.693 --> 53:27.486
- Just a moment, please.
- Yes, sir.

53:27.820 --> 53:29.446
I'll keep these in my office.

53:31.991 --> 53:34.327
- Send him in, please.
- All right.

53:39.457 --> 53:40.791
Send him in?

53:41.333 --> 53:43.252
Steve, you are a terrible chauvinist.

53:43.335 --> 53:45.712
- Gloria, I apologize.
- Accepted.

53:45.797 --> 53:47.882
I came by to make sure
you hadn't forgotten...

53:47.966 --> 53:50.885
my invitation to the little reception
at the embassy tonight.

53:50.969 --> 53:53.805
No, I hadn't forgotten,
but I thought I'd have to call you.

53:53.888 --> 53:55.974
I seem to be stuck
with a top-secret headache.

53:56.057 --> 54:00.979
Steve, I know you can't tell us
any State secrets about the nuclear airlift.

54:01.562 --> 54:05.608
But all the people that will be there
tonight are concerned and hopeful.

54:05.733 --> 54:10.321
And the very fact that an American official
of your rank stops by, even briefly...

54:10.822 --> 54:14.410
well, it's really what your
good-neighbor policy comes down to.

54:15.577 --> 54:19.038
I'll be on a tight schedule,
but I'll stick my head in.

54:19.122 --> 54:20.498
Thanks, Steve.

54:20.748 --> 54:25.461
And speaking personally,
it just might be a lot of fun.

54:36.223 --> 54:39.058
I just wanted to make myself
perfectly clear.

54:39.225 --> 54:42.521
- I am not a him.
- I'll go along with that.

54:43.063 --> 54:44.106
See you tonight.

54:49.444 --> 54:50.612
Around 8:00.

55:01.790 --> 55:03.166
I heard your visitor go.

55:03.250 --> 55:05.544
- Do you want to continue?
- Yes.

55:05.627 --> 55:07.254
Steve, black tie.

55:08.421 --> 55:10.925
Sorry, Miss... King?

55:13.511 --> 55:14.637
Duke?

55:14.804 --> 55:16.806
Prince. Diana Prince.

55:17.639 --> 55:21.267
How could I have forgotten?
You must come, too, dear.

55:23.645 --> 55:24.771
Bye, Steve.

55:33.405 --> 55:35.032
Shall we continue?

55:40.621 --> 55:42.790
There's something very familiar about her.

55:43.123 --> 55:44.541
She was at the conference.

55:45.209 --> 55:46.335
Yes, I know that.

55:47.628 --> 55:49.004
But it's something else.

55:57.054 --> 55:58.180
It's ready.

55:58.681 --> 56:00.349
How successful is the surgery?

56:01.058 --> 56:02.351
We'll know in a few seconds.

56:02.434 --> 56:05.270
It scans almost perfectly
on point-to-point overlap.

56:06.313 --> 56:07.481
And his skin?

56:07.564 --> 56:10.860
We're toning surface coloration now.
That's the last detail.

56:14.239 --> 56:16.115
All right, let's see what we've got.

56:44.227 --> 56:46.145
My face feels almost perfect.

56:51.443 --> 56:53.779
It is. It looks almost perfect.

57:02.578 --> 57:04.121
It is perfect.

57:19.054 --> 57:20.722
- Steve.
- Hello.

57:21.014 --> 57:23.016
And Diana. Welcome.

57:23.099 --> 57:26.144
There's somebody you have to meet.
It'll only take a second.

57:26.937 --> 57:28.647
You will forgive me, Diana?

57:29.105 --> 57:30.941
Of course I forgive you, Gloria.

57:34.861 --> 57:36.154
Excuse me.

58:07.853 --> 58:09.188
Very good.

58:10.022 --> 58:12.733
Hi. I'm Steve Trevor.

58:13.733 --> 58:15.151
You really are.

58:18.322 --> 58:19.865
Idiot. Wristwatch.

58:21.950 --> 58:24.036
You've been briefed on Diana Prince.

58:25.746 --> 58:26.830
Don't slip up.

58:31.586 --> 58:33.295
Excuse me for a moment, please.

58:33.796 --> 58:35.839
- Good night.
- Good night.

58:37.758 --> 58:40.260
- Everything okay?
- Never better.

58:40.344 --> 58:42.679
I'm sorry
Gloria had to drag me off like that.

58:42.763 --> 58:44.724
It was a small group of Samarrans.

58:45.433 --> 58:49.103
I understand. It's a very small country
with a big responsibility.

58:49.187 --> 58:52.357
Thanks for understanding.
Can you be understanding one more time?

58:52.898 --> 58:54.983
- Try me.
- I've got to go out to the base.

58:55.067 --> 58:56.985
I know.
Don't you want me to go with you?

58:57.069 --> 58:59.530
I want you to,
but I think it would be a good idea...

58:59.614 --> 59:02.075
if one of us stayed here
as an official presence.

59:03.368 --> 59:06.454
I don't know how convincing I'll be
as an official presence...

59:06.537 --> 59:07.789
but I'll do my best.

59:07.872 --> 59:10.374
You'll be fine.
I'll pick you up as soon as I can.

59:32.855 --> 59:36.317
Gentlemen, there's been some
developments since our original briefing.

59:36.400 --> 59:39.070
You'll be delivering your cargo
to a new destination.

59:39.945 --> 59:41.990
That new destination is Guanaray.

59:42.532 --> 59:46.036
Coordinates: 21-54, north...

59:46.787 --> 59:48.538
17-22, east.

59:49.122 --> 59:51.707
It's a mountain valley
with a mining site airstrip.

59:51.791 --> 59:54.084
It's primitive,
but it'll handle the traffic.

59:54.835 --> 59:58.715
Now, remember, complete radio silence.
And I mean complete.

59:58.798 --> 01:00:00.759
If you hear anything from anybody...

01:00:00.842 --> 01:00:03.595
including myself
or the President of the United States...

01:00:03.678 --> 01:00:05.639
ignore it. It will be neither of us.

01:00:06.389 --> 01:00:09.059
Or it will be a message
forced with a gun to our head.

01:00:09.143 --> 01:00:12.687
Mr. Trevor, are we flying this mission
without a fail-safe signal?

01:00:12.937 --> 01:00:14.648
No, Major, I was coming to that.

01:00:15.648 --> 01:00:18.485
The fail-safe code word is "capsize. "

01:00:20.737 --> 01:00:23.449
Gentlemen, this is a hot one.
We can't afford to blow it.

01:00:23.532 --> 01:00:25.993
So once you're in the air, you go.

01:00:26.243 --> 01:00:28.162
- Is that clear?
- It's clear, sir.

01:00:28.245 --> 01:00:32.248
There'll be an official from the Guanarayan
government to meet you when you land.

01:00:32.332 --> 01:00:34.250
His name is Dr. Solano.

01:00:36.669 --> 01:00:38.255
He's already on his way.

01:00:39.048 --> 01:00:40.674
You'll be in good hands.

01:00:41.467 --> 01:00:44.386
Hurry. We've got to be in Guanaray
when those planes arrive.

01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:46.388
Yes, Solano. I'm hurrying.

01:01:06.826 --> 01:01:08.036
Not bad.

01:01:09.286 --> 01:01:11.788
Yes. Very comfortable.

01:01:13.999 --> 01:01:17.628
Come on, Diana, let's relax.
We're home free.

01:01:17.878 --> 01:01:21.799
It doesn't seem to me we're home free
as long as those planes are in the air.

01:01:23.217 --> 01:01:25.386
Look, I know you don't drink ordinarily...

01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:28.764
but if I called the liquor store
down the corner, perhaps we could-

01:01:28.847 --> 01:01:31.433
- How did you know that I don't drink?
- I just assumed.

01:01:31.516 --> 01:01:32.809
It's true that I don't...

01:01:32.893 --> 01:01:36.272
but I don't recall that subject
ever coming up between us.

01:01:36.355 --> 01:01:39.192
All right. I assumed.

01:01:42.653 --> 01:01:44.572
Relax. Take it easy.

01:01:45.823 --> 01:01:49.202
We owe ourselves a little vacation,
some fun.

01:01:50.661 --> 01:01:51.829
What are you doing?

01:01:54.165 --> 01:01:57.335
Come on, you're all grown up.
You can figure that out, can't you?

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.508
Maybe we ought to say good night.

01:02:04.259 --> 01:02:06.303
Oh, no.

01:02:06.887 --> 01:02:10.681
It's been a long, successful evening,
but it's not over yet.

01:02:11.891 --> 01:02:13.017
Isn't it?

01:02:13.601 --> 01:02:14.769
Steve, please.

01:02:15.728 --> 01:02:17.773
Remember when you told me that story...

01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:22.319
about how your father got that scar
on his leg from a 20 mm shell?

01:02:23.361 --> 01:02:25.030
Yeah, sure. What about it?

01:02:25.113 --> 01:02:26.907
- And who cares?
- I do.

01:02:28.282 --> 01:02:30.034
And so does the real Steve Trevor.

01:02:30.159 --> 01:02:31.703
What are you talking about?

01:02:32.078 --> 01:02:34.706
That scar was on his shoulder.
It wasn't on his leg.

01:02:38.918 --> 01:02:42.255
Aren't we clever?
Only now, we got a problem, honey.

01:02:43.548 --> 01:02:46.135
I'm afraid I can't let you
spread that word around.

01:02:59.732 --> 01:03:03.194
Open the door.
Come on, I was only kidding.

01:03:03.736 --> 01:03:05.237
Leave the girl alone.

01:03:06.654 --> 01:03:08.990
- Who are you?
- Never mind who I am.

01:03:09.073 --> 01:03:11.659
- Where's Steve Trevor?
- It's none of your business.

01:03:23.464 --> 01:03:26.674
Where is Steve Trevor?
And where did you send the cargo planes?

01:03:27.592 --> 01:03:28.927
Answer me!

01:03:29.011 --> 01:03:31.638
Solano's estate, outside Arlington.

01:03:32.222 --> 01:03:34.224
41 Rivercrest Road.

01:03:34.475 --> 01:03:36.643
And where did you send the cargo planes?

01:03:38.187 --> 01:03:39.479
Guanaray.

01:03:40.689 --> 01:03:44.444
Rio Seco mine site.
He carved out an airstrip there.

01:03:45.445 --> 01:03:47.905
It's too late. They're gone.

01:04:03.046 --> 01:04:06.047
Relax, hero.
It'll all be over in a few hours.

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:09.092
You mean, when the cargo planes
land in Guanaray?

01:04:09.176 --> 01:04:13.139
That's right. Then you can go back
to the office and explain everything.

01:04:22.857 --> 01:04:24.191
Am I glad to see you.

01:04:28.321 --> 01:04:30.740
- Solano?
- Yeah. He rigged a double of me.

01:04:30.865 --> 01:04:34.368
Yes, I know. And diverted
the cargo planes to Guanaray.

01:04:34.869 --> 01:04:37.955
He cut out an airstrip at some place
called the Rio Seco mine.

01:04:38.039 --> 01:04:39.332
I know where that is.

01:04:39.416 --> 01:04:41.835
Maybe I can call them back.
There's still time.

01:04:42.335 --> 01:04:45.004
They should be off the coast of Panama
right about now.

01:04:45.087 --> 01:04:46.881
It'll be daylight in a few minutes.

01:04:57.642 --> 01:04:58.685
Mayday, Mayday.

01:04:58.768 --> 01:05:01.104
This is Steve Trevor,
calling Operation Eggshell.

01:05:01.187 --> 01:05:02.731
Come in, Eggshell One. Over.

01:05:03.064 --> 01:05:05.858
Eggshell One request code clearance
and fail-safe.

01:05:05.941 --> 01:05:07.736
Barry, this is Steve Trevor.

01:05:08.778 --> 01:05:10.989
Code clearance, fail-safe.

01:05:11.323 --> 01:05:12.782
It's Gaines.

01:05:13.116 --> 01:05:17.120
Code: Toro. Cordillera. Mar.
Level: Montana.

01:05:17.203 --> 01:05:20.290
There is no fail-safe.
Barry, you've been suckered.

01:05:20.373 --> 01:05:23.293
This is your authorization
to change course. Over.

01:05:23.376 --> 01:05:27.088
No can do, Steve. We're locked in.
You gave us our orders. You know that.

01:05:27.172 --> 01:05:30.300
- Your double.
- He's not gonna believe that.

01:05:32.343 --> 01:05:34.137
All right, Major. This is an override.

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.388
I am ordering you-

01:05:35.471 --> 01:05:37.892
I've got my orders. Eggshell One, out.

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.478
Eggshell, come in. Barry.

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:43.855
Nuts!

01:05:43.938 --> 01:05:47.442
They're gonna be landing in about an hour
with Solano waiting for them.

01:05:47.525 --> 01:05:50.029
Steve, you said you know
where this Rio Seco mine is?

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:52.781
Sure. It was a possible site
for the nuclear plant. Why?

01:05:52.865 --> 01:05:56.535
The man who impersonated you
is tied up in Diana Prince's apartment.

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:57.828
We should go there now.

01:05:57.911 --> 01:06:01.790
Of course. He'd know the fail-safe code.
He briefed the pilots before takeoff.

01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:05.127
That's right. But if you stop this mission,
Solano might get away.

01:06:06.044 --> 01:06:07.421
I can't help it, Wonder Woman.

01:06:07.504 --> 01:06:10.257
I'm responsible for the lives of those men
and that cargo.

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:11.842
I understand that, Steve.

01:06:11.925 --> 01:06:15.762
But I've got a plane that can get us
to the island ahead of the cargo planes.

01:06:16.054 --> 01:06:18.474
You have? Well, what's keeping us?

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.034
Getting nervous?

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:40.329
It's been a long night, and a long day.

01:06:43.957 --> 01:06:45.375
The best is yet to be.

01:07:21.912 --> 01:07:24.582
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

01:07:24.665 --> 01:07:26.166
Well, I'm looking for you.

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.919
Believe it or not,
I got here in an invisible plane.

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:30.505
What are you talking about?

01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:33.967
I'd listen if I were you, people.
It's over, Doctor.

01:07:36.303 --> 01:07:37.637
Astounding.

01:07:41.807 --> 01:07:43.935
I think we have a stand-off.

01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:49.566
But I must confess, I've almost
looked forward to this meeting.

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:52.610
If I have to go,
I'd almost like you to be the instrument.

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:56.739
- But I can give you a way out.
- What do you mean?

01:07:57.825 --> 01:08:01.077
I challenge you to a duel.
One-on-one with sabers.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.662
No, Wonder Woman.

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:05.415
He has to be an expert,
or he wouldn't challenge you.

01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:07.375
Winner take all.

01:08:14.425 --> 01:08:17.678
Agreed, if she and the others
put down their guns.

01:08:32.317 --> 01:08:35.362
My dueling sabers,
the finest blades on earth.

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.036
Don't do it. Can't you see this is a setup?

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:44.997
Don't worry, Steve.

01:09:35.256 --> 01:09:36.756
It's a robot!

01:09:39.301 --> 01:09:40.970
I want her eliminated.

01:10:02.157 --> 01:10:03.492
She's won.

01:10:05.077 --> 01:10:06.413
Let's get out of here.

01:10:06.496 --> 01:10:09.124
Once that atomic pile blows,
the whole mountain will go.

01:10:09.207 --> 01:10:12.502
- Our men are there.
- Victory is always born out of sacrifice.

01:10:14.212 --> 01:10:15.755
Everybody, run.

01:10:39.821 --> 01:10:43.157
This is Trevor calling Operation Eggshell.
Come in, Eggshell One.

01:10:43.449 --> 01:10:46.244
Eggshell One, request Code Clearance
and fail-safe.

01:10:46.327 --> 01:10:50.499
Code: Toro. Cordillera. Mar.
Level: Montana.

01:10:50.582 --> 01:10:53.460
- Fail-safe?
- Fail-safe: Capsize.

01:10:53.919 --> 01:10:55.003
Roger.

01:10:55.962 --> 01:10:58.464
Alter your course
to the original destination.

01:10:58.548 --> 01:11:02.135
Your fuel supply is sufficient
to get you to Samarra. Over.

01:11:02.301 --> 01:11:04.429
Roger. Eggshell One, out.

01:11:19.903 --> 01:11:23.448
Well, at the very least,
you've averted an international disaster...

01:11:24.324 --> 01:11:26.702
and put an end to Doctor Solano.

01:11:28.662 --> 01:11:29.913
I wonder.

01:11:32.917 --> 01:11:34.418
Thank you very much, sir.

01:11:36.503 --> 01:11:38.380
I'm afraid that would be difficult.

01:11:38.922 --> 01:11:41.341
She finds us.
It's not the other way around.

01:11:42.467 --> 01:11:44.177
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

01:11:46.222 --> 01:11:48.558
- The White House pleased?
- Seems to be.

01:11:48.641 --> 01:11:51.435
In fact, if we could get Wonder Woman
to the South Lawn...

01:11:51.519 --> 01:11:53.396
he'd pin a medal on her himself.

01:11:53.479 --> 01:11:56.064
I don't think she's interested in medals.

01:11:56.439 --> 01:11:58.191
I think she came back to help you.

01:11:59.652 --> 01:12:00.778
Us.

01:12:03.781 --> 01:12:05.789
Let's hope she comes around again.

01:12:06.498 --> 01:12:10.542
I think you can count on it.

01:12:17.079 --> 01:12:19.021
