You can get anything delivered
in New York City.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.582
Or anyone.

02:14.884 --> 02:15.885
Oh, God...

02:18.888 --> 02:21.349
But you gotta be careful
what you open your door to.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.769
Whatever you let in
will eventually get out.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.063
Particularly with me around.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.404
I should've known.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.614
No pizza run takes that long.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.743
He was so sweet to me.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.579
I was gonna make him manager.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.914
I feel so humiliated.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.335
Rough. I take cash or checks.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.700
You know, just leave the name blank.
I'll fill that in later.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.803
Hey, Mavie!

03:02.473 --> 03:03.474
Hey.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.102
Who's your friend, Mave?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.980
- I'm Rafi.
- You wash that yet?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.569
You guys hungry? I'm starving.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.821
I got another job for you.

03:16.905 --> 03:20.575
- How about you pay for the first one?
- I want you to kill him.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.703
My job here is done.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.915
He's a bad man.
You're a vigilante superhero.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.959
Let's be clear.
You want me to murder this guy?

03:30.043 --> 03:32.211
Damn skippy. He deserves it.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.881
- That's your code, right?
- Yeah, I'm getting T-shirts made.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.341
And I'll triple your fee.

03:39.510 --> 03:40.762
Hey, Rafi, come on over here.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.931
Don't do it here.
Find an alley or something.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.515
Hope you're hungry.

03:44.599 --> 03:48.186
I got a no-show
on this large pep with bells...

03:48.770 --> 03:50.521
Your boss here wants to have you killed.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.482
Yeah, right.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.818
You're caught, Rafi.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.070
She's pissed.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.781
She wants you dead.
Wants me to do the deed.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.116
You?

04:12.043 --> 04:15.463
Jesus Christ, Mavis.
I knew you were effed up, but this?

04:15.546 --> 04:17.632
But that's not...
I didn't...

04:19.968 --> 04:20.969
Why did you do that?

04:21.052 --> 04:22.845
Because I'm not a killer.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.690
Oh, bullpucky! You broke a man's neck.
I heard about it on Trish Talk.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.642
Some guy does you wrong and you kill him,

04:27.725 --> 04:30.228
but now the vigilante hero's gonna
judge me?

04:33.314 --> 04:36.484
A hero would have you locked up
for soliciting murder.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.247
A vigilante would beat the shit out
of you.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.487
Now which one am I?

04:39.570 --> 04:40.989
- I don't know.
- Choose.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.072
Please don't kill me.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.326
I don't kill people.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.578
Because I'm not a murderer.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.346
If a door won't stay closed...

05:07.724 --> 05:09.183
build a stronger door.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.389
- Yeah.
- Our daughter will never forget it.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.515
She's a huge fan.

05:49.599 --> 05:53.186
Kyle plays her the entire DVD box set,
including the Christmas specials.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.562
Great. So can I have the...

05:54.645 --> 05:58.191

It's just...
We had a deal. I just want the file.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.412
What deal? What file?
Kyle, what did you do?

06:11.496 --> 06:13.331
Uh, why don't you go make sure

06:13.414 --> 06:15.750
Lilibeth shares her toys
with the other kids?

06:20.129 --> 06:22.298
- Here you go.
- Are you crazy?

06:22.381 --> 06:25.468
The hospital will fire you if they
find out you stole a confidential...

06:25.551 --> 06:27.512
I didn't steal. I copied.

06:27.595 --> 06:30.223
It'll be our secret,
along with that performance.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.934
This is a HIPAA violation.
You could be sued or arrested.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.894
I did it for our daughter.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.939
- Where's the rest of it?
- Well, that's all I could find.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.274
- I'm married to a criminal.
- Ash, stop.

06:41.609 --> 06:42.610
Holy shit!

06:44.904 --> 06:46.948
- Patsy doesn't swear.
- I do.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.246
Patsy's kinda mean.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.248
Hey, Jess?

06:57.208 --> 06:58.292
Where are you?

07:58.144 --> 08:01.105
I thought they would have shut
movie guy down by now.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.400
Still here, first Friday every month.
Except when he's in Boca.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.321
So what's up? You sounded serious.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.785
It's been a while since we did this.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.914
Nothing better than dinner
and a movie after a crap-ass day.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.125
How early did you start?

08:24.837 --> 08:26.881
Just after my last asshole client.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.509
- You've had a lot of those lately.
- They pay the best.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.636
And you don't have
to feel anything for them.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.179
Oh, I felt something for this one.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.556
Did anyone get hurt?

08:37.225 --> 08:38.267
No.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.854
I'm just saying, it wouldn't be
the first or even the second time.

08:41.938 --> 08:46.359
That's because this supervigilante shit
keeps coming at me.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.821
It doesn't help that you keep
yakking about it on Trish Talk.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.745
I've never mentioned you
or the others by name.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.325
You said you grew up with a super.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.168
Doesn't take an Internet genius
to get to me.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.163
- I'll try harder to mask you.
- Why talk about it at all?

08:59.247 --> 09:00.847
Because I finally have something to say.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.502
Real news that matters.
And someone has to champion tolerance.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.838
You're making it harder for me
to move past shit.

09:09.674 --> 09:13.553
Well, maybe you can't move past it
without actually facing it.

09:14.929 --> 09:18.307
I put him out of my misery.
I call that facing it.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.935
I think there's more to it
than just Kilgrave.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.440
And?

09:30.069 --> 09:31.821
You're missing 20 days.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.031
Yeah. A lot more than that
if you count my blackouts.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.366
Seventeen years ago.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.578
After the accident.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.121
You were brought into the ER,

09:40.204 --> 09:43.666
but you weren't assigned a hospital bed
until 20 days later,

09:43.749 --> 09:45.918
with no hospital records in between.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.212
Where were you?

09:50.339 --> 09:53.092
- In a coma.
- That explains why you can't remember.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.887
- It doesn't explain what IGH did to you.
- We don't know that IGH did anything.

09:56.971 --> 10:01.100
You went into that hospital near death,
and you walked out with powers.

10:01.183 --> 10:05.896
And I know IGH experiments on people,
like Dr. Kozlov did to Simpson.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.775
- You've been busy.
- Yeah.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.153
And you didn't want to hear about it.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.821
Where did you get that file?

10:14.697 --> 10:17.742
A hospital security guard
who's a fan.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.998
I just sang at his kid's birthday party.

10:24.081 --> 10:28.669
Yeah, it was a low moment.
But this was worth it.

10:30.588 --> 10:34.508
Jess, Kilgrave isn't the only ghost
inside your head.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.845
- But he cracked something open in you...
- And I'm recovering.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.431
By drinking more, fighting more?

10:40.514 --> 10:42.600
More meaningless cases
and meaningless sex?

10:42.683 --> 10:44.018
Hey, don't knock meaningless sex.

10:44.101 --> 10:47.271
Knowing what they did to you
might help you.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.691
And I can expose them,
starting with Dr. Kozlov.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.693
- Okay, he's connected, but...
- No.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.405
I can't change the past.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.950
So it's gonna stay where it is.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.285
I'll deal with this on my own.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.162
Meaning go to a bar and drink.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.122
- That's what I said.
- Ugh!

11:06.290 --> 11:07.291
God damn it.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.297
Jess! I...

11:15.299 --> 11:16.842
Jess, come on! I...

11:17.802 --> 11:19.303
I can't open this!

11:21.013 --> 11:22.807
I'm not strong enough.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.517
Damn it!

11:26.811 --> 11:27.812
Jess?

11:29.146 --> 11:30.940
Jess, you up?

11:32.274 --> 11:33.526
No!

11:34.568 --> 11:35.569
You alone?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.949
I don't know.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.833
All right. First meeting's in ten.
Chug it.

11:51.335 --> 11:52.378
You're fired.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.713
Chug.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.176
Start at the beginning.

12:00.386 --> 12:04.640
I want to find my son,
but they wouldn't tell me who adopted him.

12:06.434 --> 12:10.479
There are lizards wearing human skins
and taking over the government.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.198
They threatened my wife
if I blow the whistle,

12:14.275 --> 12:15.715
but their products make people sick.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.446
Someone's trying to kill me
because I have powers.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.116
But they haven't caught up to me yet,
thanks to my super speed.

12:22.950 --> 12:27.163
I want to meet my son before I die.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.708
I need more proof
before I come forward.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.335
You have to stop the dinosaur people.
They already got Jay-Z.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.965
My superhero name?

12:39.675 --> 12:42.511
The kids in school used to call me
"the Whizzer."

12:42.595 --> 12:43.679
I bet they did.

12:43.762 --> 12:46.307
Why don't you take a lap around the block?
I'll time you.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.059
No, I can only speed when I'm scared.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.396
I'm a fear-based hero.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.027
Sorry, Whizzer.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.450
Well, I say we find the adopted son.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.368
Nope.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.497
We can afford to take a pro bono case.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.166
That will just attract more sob stories
and nut jobs.

13:12.249 --> 13:14.460
Meaning people in pain
who actually need our help.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.903
Let it get personal
and the whole case goes to shit.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.214
A good PI needs objectivity.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.382
Take the case. Take the clues.
Take the cash.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.638
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing that down. It was pithy.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.097
That wasn't a lesson.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.141
'Cause why would you help me
get better at my job?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.059
It's my job.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.982
Fire me for trying
to build something with you.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.101
I keep trying to fire you,
you keep not being fired.

13:34.146 --> 13:34.980
Why is that?

13:35.064 --> 13:36.482
Lack of clarity, I bet.

13:40.361 --> 13:43.489
Hi, I'm your two o'clock. Right on time.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.741
Punctuality an issue for you?

13:46.367 --> 13:47.701
Who is this guy?

13:47.785 --> 13:50.996
Uh, it's Pryce Cheng of Cheng Consulting.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.165
Risk management.
We're the best firm in the city.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.708
I've heard of you.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.461
- Risk management?
- It's a more pretentious name for a PI.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.216
So, what can I do for you
that you can't already do for yourself?

14:03.050 --> 14:04.218
Nothing.

14:04.301 --> 14:07.888
I mean, I have all the resources
and support staff a PI needs.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.225
A nice suite of offices,
extensive client list,

14:11.308 --> 14:12.601
excellent employee benefits.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.271
But having a powered person on staff
could bring in new clients.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.856
You want to hire her.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.150
I wanna absorb Alias Investigations.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.904
Why?

14:23.988 --> 14:27.825
Cheng Consulting needs to branch out.
We want to stay competitive.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.286
- No, thanks.
- You'd have complete autonomy.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.209
Take only the cases
that are meaningful to you.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.291
No.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.036
You might want to hear the offer
before you piss on it.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.881
You don't want me. You just want
to eliminate the competition.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.300
- I never take no for an answer.
- How rapey of you.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.970
I can't have you siphon off my clientele.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.598
I don't want your idiot clients.
I don't want most of my own.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.350
But they want you, right?
Because you're a vigilante superhero.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.436
- I wouldn't call her that.
- Get out.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.520
Fine.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.023
If you can't join 'em, beat 'em.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.626
Is that what you think
you're gonna do?

15:00.691 --> 15:02.067
You think you're gonna beat me?

15:02.651 --> 15:05.446
I'm gonna make you realize
that working for me is your best option.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.969
I always deal with problems head on.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.741
And I always deal with threats head on.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.368
Meaning I punch them in the head
until they're unconscious.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.078
Wanna see?

15:13.162 --> 15:15.456
You're gonna make this easy for me,
aren't you?

15:16.248 --> 15:17.708
You just can't help yourself.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.087
What an asshole.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.925
An asshole with the resources
to put us out of business.

15:26.508 --> 15:29.929
I guess it's good you've been taking
those money gigs. We may need it.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.848
Where you going?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.975
I have a new pro bono case.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.101
Who's the client?

15:36.727 --> 15:37.727
Me.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.032
Hey. Hey, kid.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.243
Hi, I'm Vido. We're moving in.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.373
Hey, sorry about all this.
I'm the new super here.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.708
Oscar. We're in apartment 6F.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.337
I'm 5F and in a hurry.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.172
Yeah, yeah, of course.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.966
Hey, come on, let's get to work.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.400
Let's go, little guy.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.900
Watch your toes.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.031
- You see that, Papi?
- Yeah, I see it.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.328
Are you a vigilante superhero?

16:36.412 --> 16:37.579
Oh, for Christ's sake.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.289
We're living with a powered lady.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.716
"Pretty good for a girl."

16:49.299 --> 16:51.135
I heard that a lot as a kid.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.722
Then I became
a successful female attorney.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.391
Read, pretty good for a girl.

16:59.143 --> 17:02.730
But today, I see a sisterhood
of founding partners.

17:04.147 --> 17:07.443
I see excellent lawyers who are stronger

17:07.526 --> 17:11.446
because we wouldn't stand
for being pretty good.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.784
I see mentors
raising the next generation of women,

17:15.867 --> 17:20.622
who, one day,
will stand with us on a day like this,

17:20.705 --> 17:22.665
and see what we see.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.294
Women in power.

17:26.502 --> 17:27.628
Women in law.

17:30.507 --> 17:33.635
Thank you for this great honor.
Thank you so much.

17:51.361 --> 17:52.571
What?

17:52.654 --> 17:55.449
We just got Pam's last and final offer
on her lawsuit.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.203
- We're going to settle.
- Hell we are. No way.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.165
You slept with your assistant, Jeri.
She went to jail for you.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.750
Yeah, for all of three days.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.585
She has a legitimate case.

18:06.668 --> 18:09.963
I never harassed the stupid girl.
She was more than a consenting adult.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.799
Or did you not see the way she dressed?

18:11.882 --> 18:14.885
- She practically did a split on my desk.
- Jesus Christ, Jeri.

18:14.968 --> 18:18.847
Look, we're your partners.
This scandal stains our good names, too.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.557
Well, it's not hurting mine.

18:20.641 --> 18:25.479
Because of the large donation our firm
made to essentially buy you that award.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.689
Well, fortunately, we can afford it,

18:27.773 --> 18:30.651
given the big clients like Rand
that I continue to bring in.

18:32.402 --> 18:35.405
Power's an illusion, Jeri.
Anything can happen.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.324
Just ask your dead wife.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.998
Eat your rubber chicken, Linda.
Try not to choke on it.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.379
Tomorrow, we'll dive even deeper

18:50.462 --> 18:52.840
into the effects of trauma
on powered people

18:52.923 --> 18:55.926
when noted hypnotherapist
Dr. Maynard Tiboldt

18:56.009 --> 18:58.554
joins us to discuss buried memories.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.013
I hope you'll join us, too.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.558
I'm Trish Walker, and this is Trish Talk.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.028
Hey.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.948
I love this guy.
We should get him on the show.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.533
- Huh?
- Ian...

19:19.616 --> 19:21.577
I'm kidding.
I just came down to cheerlead.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.872
You know, awesome segment today.
The call-ins were great.

19:24.955 --> 19:25.956
No, they weren't.

19:26.707 --> 19:30.085
And our ratings are sliding.
That's why you're here.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.170
You got me.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.671
Well, I'm working on something new.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.173
Medical experiment, shadow corp?

19:34.256 --> 19:35.883
You can say "IGH," Ian.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.966
- They're not Voldemort.
- But they're all fiction.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.888
Unless you can get your super sister
to corroborate that they exist.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.140
Or to corroborate
that she's even your sister?

19:43.223 --> 19:45.326
- Get her on the show.
- She doesn't want the exposure,

19:45.350 --> 19:46.894
and I won't force it on her.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.604
Okay. I respect that.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.689
Family is everything.

19:50.772 --> 19:51.815
Right.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.318
You had a good ratings run
with this super stuff.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.445
But we need new heroics,
we need interviews,

19:56.528 --> 19:57.821
and we gotta keep 'em coming in.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.365
They're very private, for obvious reasons.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.619
Which is why I was thinking we need
to go back to your lifestyle format.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.704
Something like that.

20:07.623 --> 20:11.627
"The high cost of celebrity hairstylists.
Worth it or not?"

20:12.377 --> 20:14.129
I get it! You know, I really get it.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.756
But you were Patsy Walker.

20:15.839 --> 20:19.051
If you wore chartreuse, half the tweens
in America started wearing chartreuse.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.260
You want that impact again.

20:20.344 --> 20:23.555
I'm not reliving my past, Ian.
I'm using my show to make a difference.

20:23.639 --> 20:24.723
Agreed!

20:24.806 --> 20:28.060
As long as women 18 to 49 want to listen.
Otherwise, you're gonna die.

20:28.143 --> 20:31.188
Or I mean, your show is gonna die.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.566
We're in this together. Hmm?

20:36.652 --> 20:37.653
We're family.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.949
And what's the most important thing
in the world?

20:41.490 --> 20:42.491
Family.

20:43.575 --> 20:44.618
Love that guy.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.679
I've seen
guys like Cheng before.

21:05.013 --> 21:08.392
High school quarterback.
Marine Corps captain.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.312
He needs to be the top dog.

21:21.446 --> 21:26.201
And all I need is something
that will keep him on a leash.

21:27.869 --> 21:30.706
Something that he doesn't want exposed.

21:54.688 --> 21:55.981
Where'd you learn to do this?

21:56.898 --> 21:58.984
Uh, Habitat for Humanity.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.862
My folks started me building
when I was about seven.

22:02.571 --> 22:03.905
They sound like good people.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.866
Very.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.701
That's nice.

22:12.539 --> 22:13.832
You know what I hate?

22:13.915 --> 22:17.586
Smug. I could slap smug.

22:19.504 --> 22:22.591
Pumped-up asshole blowhard
thinks he's hot shit.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.510
Hey, you're here.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.846
- Did you call?
- Just dropped by.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.852
I found something of yours
in my storage unit.

22:34.436 --> 22:38.315
You left it there 17 years ago,
and I thought you might want it back.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.902
- Uh, mind giving us a moment, Malcolm?
- Yeah. Cool.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.695
He's on the clock. Don't be dramatic.

22:59.878 --> 23:00.879
What?

23:03.548 --> 23:06.426
And I thought singing Patsy
was the lowest you would go.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.054
- It was time.
- For who?

23:09.137 --> 23:10.639
Okay, what's in the box?

23:10.722 --> 23:12.140
Her family's ashes.

23:12.224 --> 23:16.978
And they are the reason Jessica won't go
looking for her missing time or IGH.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.525
Well, that's...
You didn't wanna scatter them, or...

23:21.608 --> 23:23.276
Let me be clear this time.
You're fired.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.029
- Jess, you can't fire him.
- She's not.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.573
See you tomorrow, boss.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.413
What if you're not the only one?

23:35.497 --> 23:39.209
What if IGH is still doing experiments?
We have to stop them.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.710
Heroes die.

23:40.794 --> 23:44.214
And this is how we honor them.
By continuing the fight.

23:44.297 --> 23:45.674
You don't want to honor them.

23:46.299 --> 23:48.093
You want ratings.

23:48.176 --> 23:52.764
- And powers and stardom.
- Yes! Yes, yes and yes.

23:52.848 --> 23:56.101
Because any one of those things
will help me help people.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.561
You're not helping me.

23:57.644 --> 24:01.523
Do you have any idea how long it took me
to find out about your missing time?

24:01.606 --> 24:06.444
I'm not a PI, Jess, okay?
I don't have your gifts. I'm not you.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.780
- Yeah, well, count your blessings.
- That's for sure.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.824
What is this, Crap on Jessica Day?

24:11.741 --> 24:13.118
That's next month.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.665
I meant...

24:20.292 --> 24:23.587
I meant, I wouldn't want
a gaping hole in my head.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.714
Not knowing what was done to me,

24:25.797 --> 24:28.717
whether or not everything I do
is shaped by it,

24:29.384 --> 24:30.719
I'd be scared to hell.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.889
Well, if I wasn't before...

24:37.058 --> 24:39.853
Help me find
your missing hospital records.

24:41.062 --> 24:42.480
Or get Kozlov to talk.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.816
He could help you remember.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.568
I do remember.

24:49.362 --> 24:54.326
I remember being in that car
and waking up alone.

24:55.785 --> 24:59.206
I will spend the rest of my life
trying to forget it.

24:59.789 --> 25:03.001
Don't make me cut you out
to do that, Trish. Please.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.258
I'll put these back.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.387
- Try again in another 17 years.
- It's fine, just...

27:12.756 --> 27:14.632
To not missing you someday.

27:28.563 --> 27:29.564
Let him play.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.902
She broke it!
She broke my Game Boy!

27:55.882 --> 27:56.883
Good morning.

27:59.719 --> 28:02.013
Mrs. Belenka called this morning,

28:02.097 --> 28:05.058
canceled, said she's going another way.

28:05.683 --> 28:07.310
Which totally blows.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.438
She was good people and she could pay.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.857
And a messenger just dropped this off.

28:13.441 --> 28:16.111
From Cheng Consulting,
which can't be good.

28:40.051 --> 28:41.052
Jesus.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.682
You have to protect me.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.645
They tried to drop a huge air conditioner
on me.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.311
I was too fast, but they almost
crushed Emil, my pet mongoose.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.396
Please... Jess...

28:51.980 --> 28:52.897
Jesus, Jess!

28:52.981 --> 28:54.875
Guy's obviously challenged.
You could've been nicer.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.019
I really couldn't.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.697
You gotta be shitting me.

29:01.656 --> 29:02.657
What is it?

29:05.034 --> 29:06.745
Asshole Pryce's life story.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.582
Tax returns...

29:11.666 --> 29:14.502
college transcripts, military records.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.879
Wow.

29:18.548 --> 29:20.258
"I am an open book."

29:20.341 --> 29:23.970
Means a good PI doesn't leave secrets
that can be leveraged against them.

29:24.053 --> 29:25.263
Hmm.

29:25.346 --> 29:27.432
Again, that's not a lesson.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.687
What did you say Mrs. Bellchinso said?

29:32.771 --> 29:35.982
Mrs. Belenka.
Just that she's going another way.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.986
Lame code for "found a different PI."
Wanna guess who it is?

29:40.069 --> 29:43.823
- Cheng. He stole our damn client?
- Yep.

29:44.532 --> 29:45.366
I'm doing a search.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.744
- There's gotta be some dirt on this guy.
- There isn't.

29:47.827 --> 29:49.871
Okay, then tell me what we're looking for.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.623
I'll know it when I find it.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.802
Everyone has secrets.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.180
If not their own, then someone else's.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.237
Oh!

30:22.320 --> 30:24.864
Oh...

30:24.948 --> 30:27.700
Felipe, my little lovey dog!

30:27.784 --> 30:30.620
I believe you won custody of that dog
in your divorce agreement.

30:30.703 --> 30:33.248
- What do you think you're doing?
- Where'd you find him?

30:33.331 --> 30:36.084
Your ex-wife's been hiding him
at her new boyfriend's place.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.378
Dude, you said Felipe wasn't there.

30:38.461 --> 30:41.422
No, I said I couldn't get past
the boyfriend to see if he was there.

30:41.506 --> 30:42.924
And I didn't ask.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.844
You know, I can go places
that an average PI can't go.

30:45.927 --> 30:46.927
Emphasis on "average."

30:46.970 --> 30:48.805
You actually think
that breaking and entering

30:48.888 --> 30:51.015
- makes you better than me?
- Pryce. Bro...

30:51.099 --> 30:52.976
I have a legal right to Felipe.

30:53.059 --> 30:55.603
My wife stole him.
This woman just stole him back.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.314
Without burning
through a monumental retainer

30:58.398 --> 31:00.608
like the one you pay your bro here.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.402
Jessica Jones. Give me a call.

31:02.485 --> 31:03.736
You don't want to do that.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.699
- Let's go home, Felipe.
- I think he's going another way.

31:11.411 --> 31:12.954
You don't want to do that.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.455
You think I can't take you?

31:15.123 --> 31:17.542
- Are you serious?
- You don't know tough.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.878
Tough is working your ass off
to build a reputation.

31:19.961 --> 31:22.422
Tough is not letting assholes shit on it.

31:22.505 --> 31:25.383
I read your life story.
It put me to sleep.

31:25.466 --> 31:28.261
- Yours is much more interesting.
- You don't know shit about me.

31:28.344 --> 31:29.762
Oh, yeah? Let me take a stab at it.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.098
Few weeks of college, a lot of McJobs.

31:32.181 --> 31:34.934
Half-ass work as a PI,
drinking your demons down,

31:35.018 --> 31:37.896
till one day you meet
a hapless British clown,

31:37.979 --> 31:39.147
then murder the guy.

31:42.650 --> 31:45.612
Stay away from me.
Stay away from my clients.

31:56.247 --> 31:57.247
No.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.751
You're a ticking time bomb.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.502
Keep telling me who I am, I dare you.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.130
Maybe you blame your family
for getting killed in that accident.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.468
Don't test me.

32:13.306 --> 32:14.599
Hurry!

32:16.768 --> 32:18.770
He's bleeding. She threw him
through a glass door.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.698
Super?

32:30.782 --> 32:33.493
You're the weakest human being
I've ever met.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.717
- Stay right there.
- Put your hands behind you.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.084
Probation, huh?

33:25.003 --> 33:27.588
And court-ordered anger management.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.008
That's probably a good thing.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.720
Thanks for bailing me out.

33:35.847 --> 33:40.059
Uh, you'll still have to pay
property damage and his hospital bills.

33:40.935 --> 33:41.936
How bad is he?

33:42.895 --> 33:45.231
Bruises. Dislocated shoulder.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.359
Could've been worse.

33:51.863 --> 33:52.989
He could be dead.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.997
Do you remember when I used to dream
about them every night?

34:05.960 --> 34:09.422
But then I'd always wake up
and lose them all over again.

34:13.717 --> 34:15.094
And now they're back.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.554
I'm sorry.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.641
What if facing it makes me worse?

34:24.437 --> 34:26.230
I've already killed someone.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.900
Kilgrave gave you no choice.

34:31.194 --> 34:35.114
I snapped his neck, and I felt the pop,
and, Trish, it was easy.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.328
Jess...

34:41.454 --> 34:43.164
you're not a killer.

34:43.246 --> 34:44.290
I've killed.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.126
Ergo, I'm a killer.

34:48.168 --> 34:50.630
I don't even know what "ergo" means,
but it sounded right.

34:51.714 --> 34:54.342
That's what you were forced to do.
It's not who you are.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.551
Maybe it is.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.304
Maybe that's what they did to me.

35:00.056 --> 35:02.892
Okay, then we'll figure it out. Together.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.186
You don't...

35:06.479 --> 35:08.147
You just can't understand.

35:08.731 --> 35:11.692
There you are.
Christ, this place is a shit tangle.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.530
- Hi.
- You okay, Jess?

35:15.613 --> 35:17.031
Hey, Griffin. Yeah.

35:18.032 --> 35:20.701
Is there anything I can do?
Put in a good word with someone?

35:20.785 --> 35:22.245
You barely know me.

35:22.328 --> 35:24.038
I'm good at snap judgments.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.706
Too bad you're not the D.A.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.166
No. Give me a year.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.127
This whole news thing might not work out.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.921
Yeah, maybe not with the jokes right now.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.675
- Thank you.
- So, why are you dressed like that?

35:36.342 --> 35:39.387
Uh, we were on our way
to a charity event when you called.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.557
- Shit. Sorry.
- Hey, don't be.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.184
There's just a bunch of illiterate kids
waiting on us.

35:46.435 --> 35:49.480
- What? Jess likes my black humor.
- Not when she's arrested.

35:50.314 --> 35:53.109
Okay. So let's blow off
the literacy fund-raiser.

35:53.192 --> 35:55.862
- Get Jessica drunk.
- I don't need a lot of help there.

35:56.445 --> 35:57.655
Then we'll take you home.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.659
It's okay. I don't wanna be
the cause of stupid kids, too.

36:01.742 --> 36:03.327
See? Black humor.

36:03.411 --> 36:04.829
Griffin Sinclair!

36:04.912 --> 36:07.415
- Embedded was incredible last night.
- Oh, thank you.

36:07.498 --> 36:08.618
We saw your segment...

36:09.375 --> 36:11.752
- Jess...
- Trish, you need to stop.

36:12.712 --> 36:13.880
Or stay away.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.635
Trish Walker.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.264
I feel like I know you.
I listen to you every day.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.516
- That's so sweet.
- This is so great.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.769
- This is happening. Okay.
- Yes, it is. Okay.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.105
- That's a good 12.
- Thank you so much.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.442
- When are you two getting married?
- Easy, guys.

36:35.234 --> 36:36.652
All right.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.571
Lovely to meet you. Thank you.

36:47.079 --> 36:49.874
- Still no word from her?
- No, nothing.

36:49.957 --> 36:52.418
You didn't do this to Jessica. Okay?

36:53.085 --> 36:54.170
Her damage is deep.

36:55.087 --> 36:56.088
I can relate.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.799
Except you have three awards
and your own TV show.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.259
Yeah. Because I was a lunatic,

37:00.343 --> 37:02.511
testing my mortality
in every hellhole on earth.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.275
I had stuff to work out.
Just like Jessica.

37:04.347 --> 37:06.182
And I just sliced her open.

37:07.475 --> 37:10.394
This story of yours, is it newsworthy?

37:11.604 --> 37:12.688
It depends.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.857
Do you consider newsworthy to be

37:14.941 --> 37:17.944
potentially saving lives
and exposing some seriously bad people?

37:18.027 --> 37:20.988
You need to stop right there
or I'm just gonna steal it from you.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.907
Is that why you haven't asked about it?

37:22.990 --> 37:24.825
Work and love, keep them separate.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.643
I don't want to hurt my best friend.

37:28.704 --> 37:32.917
Babe, if you want to do the news,
the story has to be your best friend.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.253
One second.

37:35.336 --> 37:38.589
- Hey. Great to see you.
- Hi. Likewise. You taking off already?

37:47.306 --> 37:49.558
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Careful! Careful. Careful.

37:50.142 --> 37:51.143
You okay, babe?

37:51.894 --> 37:52.895
Yeah, I, um...

37:54.021 --> 37:56.023
I thought I saw someone I knew.

37:57.149 --> 37:58.484
- Okay.
- It's fine.

38:07.910 --> 38:11.122
I tried to reschedule.
Your doctor won't move the appointment.

38:11.205 --> 38:13.791
Well, did you remind her
that she owed me a favor?

38:14.417 --> 38:15.584
I e-mailed her assistant.

38:15.668 --> 38:20.798
Okay. Pick up an actual phone,
remind her and reschedule.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.552
Did Pryce Cheng say he would be late?

38:24.635 --> 38:26.345
I'm always on time.
You know that.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.222
Right. Mr. Cheng is here.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.686
I see you've met Jessica.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.355
You don't look surprised.

38:37.064 --> 38:39.025
I take it she turned down your proposal.

38:39.108 --> 38:42.737
That's really funny, Jeri.
Yeah. She did a little more than that.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.989
I told you that she was volatile.

38:45.072 --> 38:47.074
You said she was volatile, not homicidal.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.909
No wonder you wanted
to keep your distance.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.996
I only tried to hire her through you
because she and I had a falling out.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.041
Regardless, you failed.

38:55.124 --> 38:58.586
Submit your bill, and I will call you
if another assignment comes up.

38:59.962 --> 39:01.255
I got a better idea.

39:02.089 --> 39:04.800
How about I hire you instead?
I'm gonna sue her.

39:04.884 --> 39:06.344
Oh, God.

39:06.969 --> 39:09.722
Blood from a stone.
She drinks her profits.

39:09.805 --> 39:13.267
I don't care. Seriously.
She got off way too easy. Okay?

39:13.351 --> 39:15.269
She pled out guilty to the assault charge.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.937
So now I'm putting her out of business.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.397
Yeah, eliminating the competition.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.816
That's why I took the job
in the first place.

39:22.568 --> 39:23.652
Hmm.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.209
Maybe there is something
to be gained here.

39:29.617 --> 39:30.618
Have a seat.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.123
Let's, uh...

39:37.708 --> 39:41.587
Let's start with a description
of how you came by those injuries.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.903
What the hell do you want?

40:08.739 --> 40:11.492
Someone is trying to kill me.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.953
Yeah, me, if you don't put that down.

40:14.036 --> 40:17.706
You wouldn't listen.
I need you to protect me.

40:17.790 --> 40:20.584
There's something out there,
and it is strong, and it is fast,

40:20.668 --> 40:22.753
and it won't stop!

40:23.796 --> 40:26.132
All right. Jesus.

40:27.716 --> 40:29.969
It's Whizzer, right?

40:30.052 --> 40:32.555
You on meds, Whiz? Did you go off 'em?

40:32.638 --> 40:34.473
No. I take everything they send me.

40:34.557 --> 40:36.308
They're trying to make me normal again.

40:36.392 --> 40:39.019
Well, it's not working,
because no one wants you dead.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.312
Someone does!

40:41.355 --> 40:42.356
Someone like us.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.483
A schizophrenic?

40:46.193 --> 40:47.194
A monster.

40:49.155 --> 40:52.032
- You're not a monster.
- Because I take the pills.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.617
I don't want to be what they made me.

40:55.161 --> 40:58.456
- Who made you, Whizzer?
- I don't remember.

41:00.332 --> 41:04.378
But I think they've made something worse.
And it won't stop!

41:04.462 --> 41:06.088
And it is coming for me!

41:08.215 --> 41:09.884
Okay, now calm down.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.306
Stop! God damn it!

41:15.389 --> 41:17.391
- Jesus. You are fast.
- Stay away!

41:17.475 --> 41:19.226
Look, I don't wanna hurt you.

41:57.389 --> 41:58.390
Wait!

42:09.235 --> 42:11.487
Whizzer, I believe you, okay?

42:12.279 --> 42:13.364
Was it IGH?

42:14.365 --> 42:15.366
Was it Kozlov?

43:08.502 --> 43:09.670
Call 911!

43:29.732 --> 43:30.733
Dad...

43:32.234 --> 43:34.486
- Don't look, buddy.
- Is that a man?

43:34.570 --> 43:37.156
Yeah. There's been an accident.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.420
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

43:51.503 --> 43:52.755
I tried to reschedule this.

43:52.838 --> 43:54.506
Yeah, well, I wanted you to come back in.

43:54.590 --> 43:56.967
I'm not doing any more damn tests.
I'm perfectly healthy.

43:57.051 --> 43:59.595
It was just some kind of muscle cramp.

44:00.304 --> 44:02.681
I'm afraid it's not just that.

45:03.992 --> 45:04.993
Jess?

45:09.081 --> 45:10.541
Jesus.

45:12.626 --> 45:13.961
What happened in here?

45:18.924 --> 45:21.260
I should have buried them or...

45:23.595 --> 45:25.848
- Hey...
- Don't step on him!

45:43.907 --> 45:45.159
I'll take care of him.

45:57.379 --> 45:58.839
He would've been your age.

46:00.132 --> 46:01.300
Your brother?

46:02.801 --> 46:05.053
He was a pain in my ass, too.

46:06.096 --> 46:07.931
I would've liked to know him.

46:26.366 --> 46:28.952
I thought the Whizzer was just a wacko.

46:30.412 --> 46:32.039
I mean, who has a pet mongoose?

46:32.122 --> 46:33.123
The Whizzer?

46:35.042 --> 46:36.877
Oh, shit.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.838
That was him in the construction accident?

46:41.173 --> 46:42.174
Accident.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.052
Well, that's just what the cops said.

46:45.135 --> 46:47.429
They were shutting down the whole block
when I came in.

46:48.764 --> 46:50.015
He said someone...

46:51.517 --> 46:54.603
something was trying to kill him,
and now he's dead.

46:54.686 --> 46:56.271
It's a coincidence.

46:57.189 --> 46:58.774
You can't just knock down scaffolding.

46:58.857 --> 47:00.067
Well, I can't.

47:03.695 --> 47:05.155
But they made a monster.

47:17.668 --> 47:18.669
Clozapine.

47:18.752 --> 47:21.755
That's an antipsychotic.
So, I guess he was nuts.

47:21.838 --> 47:23.382
1200 milligrams?

47:23.465 --> 47:25.551
The fact that he could walk,
much less run,

47:25.634 --> 47:27.553
is a testament to his powers.

47:27.636 --> 47:29.555
Wait, he actually was "the Whizzer"?

47:29.638 --> 47:32.891
Whoever sent these to him
are the ones who made him like that.

47:34.726 --> 47:36.687
And he couldn't remember anything.

47:37.437 --> 47:39.565
- Sounds kinda like you.
- More than kinda.

47:40.649 --> 47:44.319
Lesson number one. Read the fine print.

47:45.445 --> 47:48.073
There's no prescribing doctor listed,
or pharmacy.

47:48.156 --> 47:51.159
Just the manufacturer. Salento.

47:52.077 --> 47:54.663
West Coast. They'll be open.

47:54.746 --> 47:57.499
Find out where they ship their pills,
their local distributor.

48:06.300 --> 48:08.427
Industrial Garments
and Handling.

48:09.970 --> 48:12.370
- Will you check the address again?
- It's correct.

48:13.223 --> 48:15.559
IGH. I get it. It must be a front.

48:15.642 --> 48:18.395
Hey, if the Whizzer was right
and something is killing supers,

48:18.478 --> 48:20.105
then just be careful, okay?

48:21.940 --> 48:23.025
Damn skippy.

48:41.627 --> 48:42.628
Okay.

51:17.741 --> 51:19.743
Something happened
behind these doors.

51:24.706 --> 51:25.916
We were made here.

51:26.625 --> 51:29.920
Me, Whizzer and something else.

51:37.469 --> 51:38.804
Whatever it is,

51:39.387 --> 51:43.141
the only way to find it
is to open the door wider.
