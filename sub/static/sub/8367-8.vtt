00:07.570 --> 00:09.920
--Jake...
--I see it.
--Slow down.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.550
Not stopping until we get to Rogue River.

00:17.840 --> 00:21.810
--You can't just leave her on the side of
the road like that.
--See that second set of skid marks back there?

00:22.160 --> 00:24.810
Means someone forced her off the road
and probably robbed her and killed her.

00:24.970 --> 00:27.280
For all we know, they could be waiting out there
to do it again.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.110
I don't like it anymore than you do

00:29.110 --> 00:31.030
but if we don't make it, Dad dies.

00:34.050 --> 00:35.821
This is the world we live in now.

00:42.950 --> 00:43.770
Oh.

00:43.965 --> 00:45.170
Yes, it's ready.

00:45.571 --> 00:47.966
Oh, no, honey, watch out, sweetie.
It's hot.

00:48.392 --> 00:50.076
Wow, I can't believe it worked, Mom.

00:50.949 --> 00:53.476
Yes, your father is a very smart man.

00:53.789 --> 00:56.092
--Should I go get him?
--No, honey. He's working.

00:56.566 --> 00:58.561
Besides, this thing needs time to cool.

01:07.238 --> 01:07.850
Hello.

01:08.286 --> 01:11.771
Mrs. Hawkins, do you mind if we come
in for a few minutes?

01:19.615 --> 01:22.063
Hey, Gray Anderson and Jimmy are here to see you.

01:22.065 --> 01:24.171
--They say about what?
--No.

01:24.176 --> 01:26.920
I mean, I didn't get the feeling it
was just a friendly house call.

01:27.718 --> 01:28.532
Okay.

01:40.328 --> 01:41.002
Okay.

01:41.487 --> 01:43.581
I got a route to the County Hospital in Rogue River.

01:43.588 --> 01:45.931
--Take Cedar Run Road...
--No good.

01:47.195 --> 01:49.073
You don't even know what I was going to say.

01:49.077 --> 01:52.263
--Put the map away, we're taking the back roads.
--Jake, Dad's on borrowed time.

01:52.265 --> 01:55.722
--We need to get the medicine and get back here!
-- I spent most of my teenage years driving these roads.

01:55.725 --> 01:56.980
We'll make up the time.

01:57.507 --> 01:58.802
You always think you know better.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.442
These things loaded?

02:00.937 --> 02:02.183
Yes, it's loaded.

02:09.237 --> 02:10.920
What are we going to have to do, Jake?

02:12.446 --> 02:14.402
I don't know, but when it comes time to do it...

02:15.246 --> 02:16.530
I'll be ready.

02:43.727 --> 02:45.850
You haven't said anything for miles.
Stay sharp.

02:47.517 --> 02:48.621
What happened to you, Jake?

02:49.216 --> 02:50.930
--What do you mean?
--The last five years?

02:53.217 --> 02:54.231
Where were you?

02:56.626 --> 02:57.772
I'm assuming jail.

02:59.786 --> 03:01.740
--Why won't you tell me?
--Why does it matter?

03:02.527 --> 03:04.332
Because, all that time

03:04.836 --> 03:07.110
I stood and I watched Mom and Dad suffer.

03:09.076 --> 03:11.571
Every time the phone rang,
they thought it was you.

03:11.868 --> 03:15.822
I used to hate calling the house
because we sound the same on the phone.

03:16.767 --> 03:18.921
I couldn't listen to them
realizing it was only me.

03:19.048 --> 03:20.930
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry

03:21.877 --> 03:23.520
for what I did to our family

03:23.845 --> 03:26.821
but don't use me as an excuse
for not getting on with your life.

03:28.748 --> 03:30.031
What's that supposed to mean?

03:31.256 --> 03:33.910
You wouldn't be the first guy
to leave his wife, Eric.

03:37.736 --> 03:39.301
Look, I'm not telling you to leave her

03:39.307 --> 03:41.340
--I'm just saying that...
-- You don't know what you're talking about, Jake.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.463
I'm talking about what you're afraid to say.

03:45.427 --> 03:46.832
Life's too short.

03:49.416 --> 03:51.960
Well, don't worry about me.
Just drive.

04:02.448 --> 04:05.783
--Thanks for talking with us, Robert.
--No problem, Gray.

04:07.278 --> 04:08.452
What's this all about?

04:09.396 --> 04:10.800
When I was in Topeka,

04:10.966 --> 04:16.132
people were saying that all of this could
be a first step in a foreign invasion,

04:16.445 --> 04:22.251
except that getting all these bombs
into the country would be pretty difficult...

04:22.255 --> 04:23.932
Without help on the inside.

04:24.757 --> 04:25.773
Exactly.

04:28.165 --> 04:32.860
I understand you and your family
moved to Jericho just before the attacks.

04:33.768 --> 04:38.171
You bought your house in cash on a cop's salary.

04:38.175 --> 04:42.801
--Am I under arrest for not taking on
a 30-year mortgage?
--No, of course not.

04:43.437 --> 04:44.643
Well, if you wouldn't mind

04:44.786 --> 04:50.640
--my family and I were just about
to sit down to dinner.
--Actually, if you wouldn't mind humoring us,
for a couple more minutes.

04:50.756 --> 04:52.393
You know, since all of this happened

04:52.397 --> 04:56.571
we're all, I think, understandably curious
about anybody who's new in Jericho.

04:56.575 --> 04:58.803
Well, why don't you just ask me the question?

04:59.828 --> 05:05.353
You really think I was the mastermind behind the largest
terrorist attack in the history of the world?

05:06.847 --> 05:07.822
Were you?

05:18.007 --> 05:21.143
Sorry... Listen, would you mind
if I just ask your family a few questions?

05:21.857 --> 05:22.832
That's funny.

05:26.086 --> 05:27.492
You know, when I was a cop,

05:27.495 --> 05:31.132
that is just the kind of thing
that I would say during an interrogation.

05:31.175 --> 05:34.193
--Purely informational.
--And I would have said that, too, Gray.

05:41.958 --> 05:45.043
Well, Darcy's been wanting
to get to know the neighbors.

05:48.536 --> 05:49.320
Come on.

05:58.486 --> 06:00.610
How long can he hold on like this?

06:05.946 --> 06:07.352
I can't say for sure.

06:09.676 --> 06:11.623
Maybe 12 hours.

06:12.296 --> 06:14.882
--12 hours?
--I am so sorry.

06:14.886 --> 06:19.850
I... I've been married to that man for a long time.

06:20.837 --> 06:23.620
I refuse to believe this is the way it ends.

06:33.296 --> 06:35.490
--Oh, hey.
--Hey.

06:36.085 --> 06:38.351
--I brought some food.
--Yeah. Come in.

06:38.687 --> 06:39.582
Gail's upstairs.

06:42.258 --> 06:45.932
I used to have this phobia of dairy products
that didn't need to be refrigerated.

06:47.237 --> 06:49.663
Now I think God for processed cheese food.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.912
I brought soup-- creamy mushroom

06:52.916 --> 06:56.750
--The only stuff I have left is what I had
for the food drive.
--I guess we're not the only ones.

06:57.457 --> 06:58.392
How is he?

06:59.275 --> 07:00.371
He's  getting worse.

07:00.927 --> 07:02.643
April doesn't think he has a lot of time.

07:04.687 --> 07:06.171
Oh, hi.

07:06.335 --> 07:08.603
I heard the door.
I thought it was the boys.

07:08.916 --> 07:10.601
Heather brought some food.

07:10.726 --> 07:12.112
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.582
I'm so sorry about your husband, Mrs. Green.

07:16.347 --> 07:17.643
In this day and age,

07:18.625 --> 07:20.610
how can someone die of a fever?

07:21.208 --> 07:23.792
It's the 21st century,
I can't get the right drugs.

07:24.188 --> 07:26.493
Can't even find ice to cool him off.

07:27.678 --> 07:28.923
I can make ice.

07:30.105 --> 07:34.211
I... one of the students had a project
in the science fair last year.

07:34.217 --> 07:36.771
I just need water and...

07:38.465 --> 07:39.751
Do you have fertilizer?

07:40.228 --> 07:42.142
Maybe. In the garage.

07:42.658 --> 07:46.350
Okay. I can do this... I think.

07:46.978 --> 07:48.342
Okay, let's try.

07:48.707 --> 07:51.653
Okay. Grab every large bowl you have.

07:51.868 --> 07:54.590
And can you get some buckets, and get
some fresh water from the well.

07:54.598 --> 07:55.491
It'll be cooler.

07:55.498 --> 07:56.570
I'll get the fertilizer.

07:56.617 --> 07:58.221
Buckets  are in the laundry room.

08:35.304 --> 08:36.552
Where is everybody?

08:37.847 --> 08:39.491
Come on.
Let's get to the hospital.

08:56.066 --> 08:57.272
See those markings?

08:58.376 --> 09:01.621
These homes were evacuated 10-25 by FEMA.

09:01.627 --> 09:04.990
10-25-- that means they came through a
month after the bombs.

09:06.286 --> 09:09.570
Well, if FEMA was here, at least there's still
some sort of government.

09:09.575 --> 09:10.710
As of a week ago.

09:11.455 --> 09:12.943
What are the other numbers?

09:13.617 --> 09:16.433
The zero is the number they found alive.

09:17.525 --> 09:18.633
And the two?

09:18.727 --> 09:20.183
The number of dead.

09:32.328 --> 09:34.720
We're going to go in, we're going to get the medicine,
and we're going to get out.

09:34.765 --> 09:35.470
Okay.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.392
"Federal Emergency Management Agency
has determined that

09:44.925 --> 09:49.853
radioactive fallout from the blast in Lawrence,
Kansas has contaminated the water table of this region.

09:50.445 --> 09:54.243
"Under no circumstances should water
from any taps or wells be consumed. FEMA."

09:55.938 --> 09:58.670
Well, I guess that explains why
this place is empty.

09:59.105 --> 09:59.980
What the hell?!

10:00.277 --> 10:01.780
Where's that coming from?!

10:02.375 --> 10:03.552
We got to get inside!

10:04.105 --> 10:05.041
Stay close.

10:24.566 --> 10:26.650
Oh, my God.
What happened here?

10:27.168 --> 10:27.900
You okay?

10:29.078 --> 10:29.940
Yeah.

10:30.135 --> 10:32.211
--Where do you think those shots came from?
--Top floor.

10:32.728 --> 10:33.941
Who the hell would be shooting at us?

10:33.948 --> 10:36.970
I don't know; if they have any Cipro,
it's probably upstairs.

10:59.551 --> 11:00.706
.556.

11:01.022 --> 11:02.706
From an automatic weapon.

11:03.689 --> 11:05.486
Maybe they belong to these guys.

11:07.999 --> 11:11.611
--I didn't know Rogue River had a SWAT team.
--They don't.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.021
These guys aren't cops.

11:13.415 --> 11:15.063
They're government contractors.

11:15.637 --> 11:19.581
A private army. A firm called Ravenwood.

11:19.906 --> 11:22.253
What are mercenaries doing in Kansas?

11:22.456 --> 11:25.042
The same thing they've been
doing in Iraq and New Orleans.

11:25.236 --> 11:29.401
The military's been stretched so thin
the past few years, mercenaries became a commodity.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.121
The real question is,

11:31.648 --> 11:33.363
did they kill these people?

11:33.756 --> 11:37.782
--Look, let's just get the drugs and go, okay?
--All right.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.512
--You ready?
--Yeah.

11:48.146 --> 11:49.742
Nice job with the stove.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.202
You burn the wood in the broiler-- right.

11:52.326 --> 11:56.673
Yeah. You know, we're just lucky
we had gas instead of an electric

11:56.677 --> 11:59.541
'cause it's got its own built-in vent.

11:59.635 --> 12:00.691
Where's your brother?

12:02.707 --> 12:04.620
How should I know?
I'm here with you.

12:04.627 --> 12:07.013
Allison... manners.

12:07.447 --> 12:09.171
Let me know when dinner's back on.

12:11.425 --> 12:14.241
Will you, um... just pardon me a moment?

12:15.616 --> 12:20.591
So, Darcy, why did you decide to move to Jericho?

12:22.316 --> 12:23.103
Hey.

12:23.557 --> 12:24.813
I don't like that guy.

12:26.808 --> 12:30.482
I need you to do something for me, okay?

12:47.998 --> 12:51.631
The ammonium nitrate in fertilizer
extracts the heat from the water.

12:51.637 --> 12:54.822
--How long is this supposed to take?
--I think a while.

12:56.826 --> 12:58.810
I'm going to go up and check on him.

13:00.508 --> 13:02.790
God,  I hope I'm not screwing this up.

13:03.075 --> 13:04.713
She's been up for 24 hours.

13:05.738 --> 13:07.973
They've been married for 40 years.

13:08.366 --> 13:09.812
Can you imagine?

13:11.105 --> 13:12.902
I'm was supposed to be married tomorrow.

13:13.846 --> 13:15.290
Hey, hey.

13:15.767 --> 13:17.250
Roger's coming back.

13:18.705 --> 13:19.841
So'Jake.

13:25.476 --> 13:26.802
All right, stay close to the wall.

13:31.658 --> 13:32.753
Come on. Come here.

13:36.567 --> 13:40.241
Look, if something happens to me, get
in the car and go.

13:40.325 --> 13:41.583
All right? Find another town.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.463
Search house to house, if you have to.

13:43.466 --> 13:45.463
Jake, nothing is going to happen to you.

13:45.638 --> 13:47.853
Okay? Nothing ever does.

13:48.796 --> 13:50.510
Go! Go! Move!

13:55.687 --> 13:57.602
You went to Crow Island School.

13:58.425 --> 14:00.423
We moved here after our grandfather died.

14:01.406 --> 14:04.631
--Sam, are you listening?
--I'm hungry. I want dinner.

14:04.998 --> 14:06.473
Oh, God...

14:07.427 --> 14:08.411
You know what, Sam?

14:08.415 --> 14:10.093
You should tell that to the guys in there.

14:10.095 --> 14:12.533
Just keep saying it as much
as you can, okay.

14:15.328 --> 14:18.702
--Hey, pal, what you drawing?
--My old house.

14:18.708 --> 14:19.640
Oh, yeah?

14:19.645 --> 14:20.930
Well, where is that?

14:24.356 --> 14:25.760
I'm hungry.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.850
Well, you know what, as soon
as we're finished talking

14:28.855 --> 14:31.360
--maybe your mom will give you some of that pie.
--I want it now.

14:31.725 --> 14:33.951
--Well, in a few...
--Now. I'm hungry.

14:34.936 --> 14:38.073
--He  gets a little cranky when he's hungry.
--Yeah, I see that.

14:38.696 --> 14:41.963
--You mind if we get him something to eat?
--No, no, of course not.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.721
I'll take him to the kitchen.
Come on, Sam.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.952
Would you mind hanging out for a couple minutes?

14:53.287 --> 14:54.110
Whatever.

14:56.418 --> 14:57.070
Sam.

14:57.936 --> 14:59.230
See ya, buddy.

15:05.178 --> 15:06.500
You okay?

15:08.387 --> 15:09.570
You say something?

15:10.558 --> 15:11.812
All I hear is ringing.

15:12.207 --> 15:13.853
It'll pass in a minute.

15:14.248 --> 15:18.890
--You down there, freeze! Drop your weapons!
--No.

15:19.607 --> 15:21.160
We're here for medicine.

15:21.166 --> 15:23.323
It's an emergency.
We don't want trouble.

15:24.185 --> 15:25.630
There's no medicine here.

15:25.795 --> 15:27.643
We want to look for ourselves.

15:30.118 --> 15:31.520
We can trade you for food.

15:32.116 --> 15:34.180
We have everything we need.
Go away.

15:38.617 --> 15:40.323
--Jake...
--What?

15:40.326 --> 15:41.611
What, are you crazy?

15:41.797 --> 15:43.240
Didn't you hear him? He's scared.

15:43.326 --> 15:46.802
He threw a grenade. That was a flash-bang,
not a grenade.

15:47.025 --> 15:48.963
It's  just loud and bright to scare us.

15:49.205 --> 15:51.201
If he'd wanted to kill us, he would have.

16:07.585 --> 16:09.513
Putting our weapons down and coming up.

16:10.017 --> 16:12.012
You come up and I'll shoot you.

16:12.927 --> 16:14.563
All right, just take it easy.

16:28.797 --> 16:29.933
That's far enough.

16:43.615 --> 16:44.551
Gail...

16:46.038 --> 16:47.873
Oh, it's me, April.

16:49.686 --> 16:51.360
Gail's downstairs.

16:52.156 --> 16:53.320
She'll be up soon.

16:59.506 --> 17:01.812
I wish there was something more I could do.

17:03.306 --> 17:04.403
But there isn't.

17:06.208 --> 17:08.201
Please just hold on a little longer.

17:11.578 --> 17:13.223
Can I tell you a secret?

17:17.325 --> 17:19.830
You are going to be a grandfather.

17:23.836 --> 17:25.560
I haven't told anyone yet.

17:26.976 --> 17:27.960
Not even Eric.

17:29.656 --> 17:31.502
I don't know what he's going to say.

17:34.525 --> 17:37.030
But this child needs a grandpa.

17:41.426 --> 17:43.033
Hold on, okay?

17:44.058 --> 17:45.031
Please.

18:16.355 --> 18:17.561
You're with Ravenwood.

18:19.218 --> 18:20.020
How do you know?

18:22.608 --> 18:24.562
I spent a year and a half in the Green Zone

18:24.567 --> 18:27.621
running a supply rig up and down
Route Irish to BIAP.

18:29.585 --> 18:30.482
You were in Iraq?

18:31.185 --> 18:35.082
--Soldier?
--No, I just drove a truck for another contractor

18:35.087 --> 18:36.962
but I met a lot of Ravenwood guys.

18:40.648 --> 18:41.811
Where were you?

18:43.388 --> 18:44.442
Fallujah.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.812
Man, I thought I had it bad.

18:49.927 --> 18:52.082
I thought it was the worst thing
I'd ever lived through...

18:52.636 --> 18:53.421
till now.

19:00.007 --> 19:01.503
You mind putting that thing down?

19:02.466 --> 19:04.852
I'm just here for medicine.
We don't have a lot of time.

19:06.708 --> 19:08.823
This is my brother Eric. I'm Jake.

19:12.075 --> 19:12.971
Come on.

19:20.105 --> 19:21.243
Randy Payton.

19:30.876 --> 19:32.561
I'll take you to see the doc.

19:35.096 --> 19:36.420
You're in, uh...

19:37.295 --> 19:38.661
you're in pretty bad shape.

19:39.447 --> 19:42.541
Morphine and instant coffee are the only things
keeping me standing right now.

19:43.798 --> 19:45.373
What are you doing in Kansas?

19:45.726 --> 19:47.170
Not enough National Guard.

19:48.276 --> 19:49.840
Homeland Security hired us.

19:50.505 --> 19:52.751
Brought us in to protect
the governor of Nebraska.

19:52.755 --> 19:55.100
Wait, the governor's alive?

19:55.946 --> 19:56.920
Don't know.

19:57.865 --> 19:58.732
When we landed,

19:59.127 --> 20:01.821
they brought us over here to help FEMA
evacuate Rogue River.

20:01.826 --> 20:02.881
Where to?

20:04.018 --> 20:08.361
FEMA set up a tent city in a Wal-Mart parking lot.

20:08.366 --> 20:10.012
A few miles north of here.

20:12.965 --> 20:14.293
What happened to these people?

20:17.675 --> 20:19.353
These are the ones that couldn't be moved.

20:21.585 --> 20:22.413
Too old...

20:24.915 --> 20:25.853
too sick.

20:27.426 --> 20:28.832
So you just killed them?

20:29.656 --> 20:31.410
No, not me.

20:32.088 --> 20:33.410
We tried to move them.

20:33.808 --> 20:35.290
But the doctors wouldn't allow it.

20:36.437 --> 20:37.963
There were so many of them.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.501
Crying out, begging.

20:41.097 --> 20:42.241
The guys, they just wanted to come in

20:42.248 --> 20:44.353
and they just wanted to take the medicine
and they wanted to leave

20:44.358 --> 20:47.232
but the doctors started arguing with them

20:47.236 --> 20:49.550
and then, one of our guys, he...

20:50.886 --> 20:51.900
he just snapped.

20:52.887 --> 20:54.092
He started firing.

20:54.527 --> 20:57.231
Before I knew it, they all emptied their weapons.

20:58.446 --> 20:59.972
Why didn't you stop them?

21:00.766 --> 21:02.532
How do you think I got shot?

21:05.176 --> 21:07.180
They left me for dead with everybody else.

21:24.126 --> 21:25.382
There's the doc.

21:25.386 --> 21:27.382
When I came to, he was working on me.

21:27.656 --> 21:29.182
Patched me up as best he could.

21:29.738 --> 21:31.653
Been trying to save everybody else since then.

21:34.717 --> 21:36.251
I need more bloody light.

21:36.608 --> 21:38.400
--Doc?
--Yeah?

21:38.687 --> 21:39.973
This is Jake and Eric.

21:40.335 --> 21:41.583
And they need medicine.

21:41.977 --> 21:45.302
Dr. Kenchy Dhuwalia.
Forgive me if I don't shake your hand.

21:50.196 --> 21:51.372
I need Cipro.

21:54.686 --> 21:55.362
Right.

21:56.427 --> 21:58.502
Morphine's worth a lot more, you know?

21:58.505 --> 22:01.121
Hey, I'm not selling it, all right?
I need it now.

22:01.197 --> 22:02.491
It's for my father.

22:20.186 --> 22:21.403
It's Ravenwood.

22:23.106 --> 22:23.922
They're back.

22:28.106 --> 22:29.592
There are six or eight of them.

22:31.046 --> 22:32.060
They brought a truck.

22:32.537 --> 22:34.262
They're gonna clean out the hospital.

22:35.017 --> 22:38.262
Medicine, supplies, anything that's not nailed down.

22:42.295 --> 22:45.072
And they're gonna kill anybody they find alive.

22:46.178 --> 22:47.390
We know what they did.

22:47.906 --> 22:49.580
We can't let them get inside.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.020
Hey! Hey!

22:59.105 --> 23:00.161
One down.

23:01.107 --> 23:03.842
--What about a back exit?
--It's barricaded.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.632
You want to live, stand up and fight.

23:12.438 --> 23:15.143
Well, that's when my grandma died
and left everything to my parents.

23:15.496 --> 23:18.510
They wanted me out of the school
I was in, so... we moved.

23:19.857 --> 23:24.671
--Was your father away from home
a lot when you were a kid?
--Of course. He's a cop.

23:25.106 --> 23:29.563
Mm. Did he bring friends around, anybody
you thought was kind of strange?

23:29.806 --> 23:31.723
His friends are all cops.

23:34.216 --> 23:35.112
What about money?

23:35.506 --> 23:38.520
--Did your parents ever argue over money?
--Doesn't everyone's?

23:38.528 --> 23:40.050
No, I-I'm thinking...

23:40.337 --> 23:43.112
you know, about the sudden windfall.

23:43.405 --> 23:45.250
--Like my Grandma's inheritance?
--Right.

23:45.256 --> 23:46.641
When was that again?

23:47.755 --> 23:51.313
What-what, are you stupid?
I already told you, six months ago.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.073
Don't be disrespectful, Allison.

23:53.078 --> 23:56.881
Dad, this is bull-- he's in our house
acting like we're criminals or something.

23:58.528 --> 24:01.970
--Are you harassing everyone in
town or just the black people?
-- That's enough

24:02.328 --> 24:05.863
--Why are you letting him do this?
--Look, I apologize, Mr. Anderson.

24:05.867 --> 24:08.951
--You're apologizing to him?
--Yes, and so will you.

24:08.955 --> 24:11.611
--Oh-ho, forget that. I'm not sorry.
--Apologize.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.173
Dad, he's a racist!

24:13.497 --> 24:16.661
I hate this stupid town--
I wish we never moved!

24:25.585 --> 24:26.641
They're coming in.

24:26.927 --> 24:28.053
Why weren't they shooting?

24:28.055 --> 24:30.273
Ammo's in short supply-- they're
gonna wait to fight in close.

24:30.277 --> 24:32.630
--Take some of these clips.
--They're all empty.

24:32.865 --> 24:35.613
Look, we got to get the medication
and get out of here. Doc!

24:35.618 --> 24:36.860
Where's the Cipro?

24:37.176 --> 24:38.881
--Where's the Cipro!
--On the shelf.

24:38.936 --> 24:39.993
They're gonna come straight for us.

24:39.995 --> 24:42.723
We got to hide, let 'em pass,
then we can slip out.

24:43.497 --> 24:44.830
I couldn't even save one.

24:45.205 --> 24:46.112
Not even one!

24:46.116 --> 24:48.380
Doc, we got to go or we're gonna be dead, too.

24:49.405 --> 24:52.211
--I got it, I got it!
--Come on!

24:57.978 --> 24:59.651
My girl's been through a lot.

25:00.658 --> 25:05.712
--But I raised her better than that.
--I want to assure you, Mr. Hawkins,
that this is not about color.

25:06.108 --> 25:10.211
Black, white or otherwise, my only objective
is to protect the people of Jericho.

25:11.127 --> 25:12.961
I got a boy about the same age.

25:13.166 --> 25:16.062
You should bring yours over sometime-- Samuel
could use a playmate.

25:16.067 --> 25:19.080
Would you mind if Jimmy has a quick look
around the house while we talk?

25:20.856 --> 25:21.592
Excuse me?

25:22.068 --> 25:23.941
Just a question of being thorough.

25:25.017 --> 25:28.691
And is... searching houses standard policy here?

25:29.126 --> 25:32.713
I thought this was... Kansas, not Soviet Russia.

25:33.147 --> 25:36.091
You know, we been pretty easy-going about all this.

25:36.137 --> 25:40.211
And I'm only asking for a little more
patience so I know I can vouch for you.

25:40.565 --> 25:43.620
Unless... you're afraid
there's something we'll find.

25:47.667 --> 25:51.503
You know, if you can overlook the mess...

25:52.138 --> 25:55.141
...we can overlook the violation of our civil rights.

25:57.567 --> 25:58.431
Um...

25:58.635 --> 26:00.700
I'll just take a quick peek around, and...

26:01.178 --> 26:02.982
then we'll be on our way.

26:33.488 --> 26:34.390
Come on, let's go.

26:35.807 --> 26:37.913
What do you say we wait
till they leave the building?

26:37.915 --> 26:40.261
That could take hours--
Dad doesn't have hours.

26:40.465 --> 26:41.350
What's wrong with him?

26:42.188 --> 26:43.822
He's gone into septic shock.

26:44.656 --> 26:47.620
Sepsis? You have to go back.

26:48.028 --> 26:49.191
What are you talking about?

26:49.466 --> 26:52.090
If your father's in septic shock,
that means his organs are shutting down.

26:52.095 --> 26:53.773
That means that by the time
you get to him

26:53.777 --> 26:56.133
his body won't even be able
to process the Cipro.

26:56.138 --> 26:58.280
You need an intravenous drug.

26:58.288 --> 26:59.462
It's called Levaquin.

26:59.756 --> 27:01.912
--It's back in the ICU.
--What's it look like?

27:02.077 --> 27:04.600
It's a clear bottle, purple label.

27:04.605 --> 27:07.811
--You'll need syringes.
--Jake, this is nuts. We can't go back there.

27:07.818 --> 27:09.612
Well, we can't take the chance we have
the wrong medicine.

27:09.617 --> 27:12.041
--What, we gonna shoot our way through?
--Yeah, if I have to.

27:13.455 --> 27:14.511
I'm with you.

27:17.606 --> 27:19.013
Are you with me or not?

27:29.756 --> 27:30.542
O kay.

27:31.798 --> 27:34.152
--But we need a plan.
--All right.

27:41.597 --> 27:43.160
This is definitely taking too long.

27:43.166 --> 27:44.413
Like the water should be freezing by now.

27:44.416 --> 27:47.880
You know, let's just dump these and start over.
--Okay, shouldn't we wait till we figure out
what we've done wrong?

27:47.886 --> 27:49.721
No. This is all we have.

27:50.136 --> 27:51.672
The mayor's running out of time.

27:51.678 --> 27:52.802
We got to cool him down.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.902
Everybody's counting on me,
and it's not working.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.980
Yeah, but we have to give it time to work.

27:56.987 --> 27:58.433
Okay, you're freaking out!

28:01.528 --> 28:02.501
This one's cold.

28:03.468 --> 28:04.360
It's working.

28:05.577 --> 28:07.533
What did you do differently with this one?

28:08.865 --> 28:12.272
The... the bowl-- it's aluminum.

28:12.608 --> 28:17.360
--God, plastic's an insulator-- I'm so stupid.
--So we just need more of these, right?
--Yeah.

28:17.565 --> 28:21.141
--Anything metal-- pie tins, anything.
--All right, I'll get 'em from the kitchen.
--Okay.

28:21.395 --> 28:22.661
We got ice!

28:29.816 --> 28:30.793
Don't shoot.

28:32.678 --> 28:35.451
I'm a doctor. I'm unarmed.

28:35.656 --> 28:36.881
On your knees.

28:39.106 --> 28:40.000
Who are you?

28:45.197 --> 28:47.143
I can help your friend.

28:59.915 --> 29:00.813
What's your name?

29:03.095 --> 29:04.411
What's your name?

29:04.537 --> 29:07.043
--Don't make me ask you again.
--Eric.

29:07.758 --> 29:09.860
Eric Green. I'm a doctor.

29:10.585 --> 29:12.182
The Red Cross brought me here.

29:12.628 --> 29:13.870
To shoot at me?

29:14.938 --> 29:18.282
--That wasn't me.
--Who was it?
The guys in that muscle car?

29:19.397 --> 29:20.922
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:21.827 --> 29:22.961
Where are they?

29:26.526 --> 29:27.702
Where are they?

29:31.978 --> 29:33.960
They're in the therapy room downstairs.

29:34.876 --> 29:37.370
There's, uh, three or four of them.

29:39.256 --> 29:40.233
Get 'em.

29:53.008 --> 29:54.572
Your man lost a lot of blood.

29:55.435 --> 29:56.803
I can help him.

30:00.255 --> 30:00.921
Get up.

30:09.525 --> 30:10.341
Fire in the hole!

30:13.407 --> 30:14.151
Clear left.

30:14.535 --> 30:15.402
Clear right.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.243
Room's empty. Move out.

30:24.277 --> 30:26.083
All right, we need something to cut his shirt.

30:26.948 --> 30:29.172
Uh, s-something sterile.

30:44.127 --> 30:45.293
Hey, what are you doing?

30:45.765 --> 30:48.271
I'm... I'm just getting something for the pain.

30:48.707 --> 30:50.311
He can handle the pain.

30:50.316 --> 30:51.490
Just get to work.

31:44.985 --> 31:48.780
You people drafted my husband
into your police force

31:48.866 --> 31:50.642
and now you're suspecting him
of being a criminal.

31:50.648 --> 31:53.121
We're not suspecting anything.

31:53.128 --> 31:56.490
--We just want to know...
--Yeah.
"Who's in your town."

31:56.495 --> 31:57.483
Yeah, I heard.

31:58.975 --> 32:03.493
This has been unpleasant for all of us.
Some more than others.

32:07.645 --> 32:08.863
I found something.

32:36.438 --> 32:37.452
Darcy.

32:38.546 --> 32:40.862
I'm gonna need a minute alone with Mr. Anderson.

33:00.598 --> 33:02.082
Payton, let's go! Go on! Come on!

33:02.088 --> 33:03.650
Car's out front. Go!

33:03.855 --> 33:05.961
No. This is on me.

33:06.166 --> 33:09.011
--Payton. They'll kill you. Come on.
--I don 't care.

33:09.207 --> 33:10.583
I deserve this.

33:11.928 --> 33:13.533
I emptied my gun up there, too.

33:14.906 --> 33:16.851
Go. Let me do this.

33:26.108 --> 33:27.662
Come on! Go!

33:27.728 --> 33:29.912
--Where's Payton?
--He's not coming.

33:41.595 --> 33:44.730
Why didn't you just tell me
you were a federal agent?

33:48.515 --> 33:50.821
How do you even know that that badge is real?

33:53.727 --> 33:54.982
I guess...

33:55.765 --> 33:56.981
I don't.

33:59.606 --> 34:01.801
The fakes are usually made of aluminum.

34:02.897 --> 34:05.130
It's cheaper. Lighter.

34:05.797 --> 34:07.051
If it's heavy...

34:09.475 --> 34:10.922
...that's how you know.

34:11.786 --> 34:15.543
Don't just assume that because somebody has
one of these that it is real

34:15.547 --> 34:17.150
especially not these days.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.409
--But why didn't you say anything?
--Because I don't know you.

34:21.297 --> 34:23.242
I don't know who I can trust.

34:24.347 --> 34:26.812
You see, the bureau was tracking some
suspicious contacts

34:26.818 --> 34:30.922
between unknown people
in this area of Kansas and...

34:32.456 --> 34:33.902
terrorist groups abroad.

34:34.147 --> 34:35.402
What kind of contacts?

34:35.697 --> 34:36.952
Pay phone calls.

34:37.907 --> 34:39.243
Money transfers.

34:40.696 --> 34:44.502
You know, I was relocated to investigate
undercover, Mr. Anderson.

34:44.815 --> 34:45.902
and as far as I'm concerned

34:45.916 --> 34:47.820
I am still on the job, so...

34:48.145 --> 34:51.969
--I would appreciate your discretion.
--No, of course. Jimmy's the only one who knows.

34:51.978 --> 34:54.242
--I'll make sure it stays that way.
--Good.

34:57.555 --> 35:01.953
The people who did this, they will try
to hit us again.

35:03.637 --> 35:05.010
We can't let that happen.

35:05.776 --> 35:09.652
But from now on, we keep an open line
with one another.

35:10.437 --> 35:11.533
Okay, then.

35:19.958 --> 35:21.210
Man, it's been a long day.

35:22.586 --> 35:23.523
If you don't mind...

35:25.348 --> 35:27.230
I'm just happy to have you on the team, Mr. Hawkins.

35:27.237 --> 35:29.622
I'm very sorry for the intrusion.

35:29.855 --> 35:31.891
You do not have to apologize for anything.

35:32.538 --> 35:33.712
You did good work.

35:51.346 --> 35:52.121
Is he?

35:52.225 --> 35:53.670
Barely. Just hurry.

35:57.157 --> 35:59.590
--Okay, let's go.
--April...

36:00.188 --> 36:02.763
--This is Dr. Kenchy.
--April Green.

36:02.766 --> 36:03.650
Did you get the Cipro?

36:05.948 --> 36:07.312
This is Levaquin.

36:07.637 --> 36:09.820
It will go directly into his system.

36:09.938 --> 36:12.052
--Are we on time?
--Well...

36:12.186 --> 36:13.942
if his body is strong enough,

36:14.346 --> 36:15.821
we will know by morning.

36:17.048 --> 36:18.141
He's strong enough.

36:29.675 --> 36:31.081
You're gonna be all right, Dad.

36:32.418 --> 36:33.983
You're going to be okay, sweetheart.

36:52.626 --> 36:53.871
It's a nice job.

36:55.426 --> 36:56.402
Got the key?

37:01.765 --> 37:02.541
Thank you.

37:07.627 --> 37:09.110
I know you're one of the good guys.

37:19.308 --> 37:22.873
--Thanks for staying with my mom.
--Glad to help.

37:24.095 --> 37:25.351
She's being humble.

37:25.745 --> 37:27.200
She saved your father's life.

37:31.395 --> 37:33.030
Well, you guys get some sleep.

37:40.595 --> 37:41.960
What did you see out there?

37:46.805 --> 37:47.661
Another time.

37:51.498 --> 37:52.392
Good night.

37:54.278 --> 37:55.212
Good night.

38:12.096 --> 38:15.542
--What's all this stuff?
--I don't know.

38:17.307 --> 38:18.361
How you feeling?

38:23.657 --> 38:24.673
Honestly...

38:26.987 --> 38:27.961
Couldn't tell you.

38:33.028 --> 38:34.041
You'll be okay.

38:35.847 --> 38:36.900
All right?

38:40.668 --> 38:42.152
You'll get through this.

38:42.478 --> 38:44.660
You're a much better person than I am, so...

38:45.576 --> 38:46.912
I know you'll be fine.

38:50.946 --> 38:52.883
I don't know if I'm a better person.

39:03.077 --> 39:04.552
I'm in love with Mary Bailey.

39:07.396 --> 39:08.683
You knew that, didn't you?

39:14.986 --> 39:16.123
I'm gonna tell April.

39:18.878 --> 39:20.432
Life's too short, right?

39:21.848 --> 39:24.311
Whatever you do, I'm sure
it'll be the right thing.

39:27.657 --> 39:28.751
Let's get some rest.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.603
Where's my jacket?

39:49.108 --> 39:50.883
I don't know. Did you leave it in the car?

39:53.507 --> 39:55.532
Jake, I left my jacket back there--

39:55.867 --> 39:58.490
the wallet is in the jacket-- the address.

39:58.495 --> 40:02.322
--What if those guys come here?
--Those guys are dead, all right?
Payton took care of it.

40:02.607 --> 40:03.500
Don't worry.

40:04.685 --> 40:07.380
--I'm sorry I screwed up.
--You did great out there today.

40:08.758 --> 40:10.822
Get some sleep, we'll worry about it tomorrow.

40:17.386 --> 40:19.762
--Good night.
--Good night.

40:31.316 --> 40:32.651
Good. See to that.

40:33.395 --> 40:35.821
Mount up, boys! We're moving out!

40:44.135 --> 40:45.380
Jericho.
