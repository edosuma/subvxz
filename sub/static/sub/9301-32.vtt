WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:47.312 --> 01:48.404
Be careful, son.

01:48.714 --> 01:50.579
That last laser was a little close.

01:50.782 --> 01:51.806
I know.

01:52.017 --> 01:54.349
The last thing I want to do
is hurt one of them, but...

01:54.553 --> 01:57.147
Uh oh, they're coming closer.

02:28.086 --> 02:30.520
Our force-shield isn't holding over there.

02:35.494 --> 02:37.485
I'll try to reach Man-At-Arms again.

02:37.696 --> 02:39.561
There must be something
wrong with this radio.

02:39.765 --> 02:41.528
Man-At-Arms?  Man-At-Arms?

02:41.700 --> 02:43.998
This is Hovar. Can you hear me?

02:47.072 --> 02:47.970
Father...

02:48.173 --> 02:50.187
What happens if...
if Man-At-Arms

02:50.212 --> 02:51.928
doesn't come through for us?

02:52.110 --> 02:54.044
Man-At-Arms always comes through, son.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.745
Man-At-Arms, come in, please.

02:57.149 --> 02:59.344
Duncan? Teela? Do you hear me?

02:59.618 --> 03:01.609
We are in trouble. We need help.

03:01.787 --> 03:03.220
Hovar, this is Duncan.

03:03.421 --> 03:05.412
We hear you. We're doing our best.

03:05.824 --> 03:07.621
It's no use. They don't hear us...

03:09.094 --> 03:10.384
and the situation on Selkie

03:10.409 --> 03:11.985
Island is getting worse, Teela.

03:12.531 --> 03:14.556
I'm working as fast as I can.

03:17.135 --> 03:18.602
With their force shield failing...

03:18.770 --> 03:21.170
That VHO is the only thing
that can save them from...

03:22.174 --> 03:24.199
It's almost ready for testing.

03:26.178 --> 03:28.646
Oh, isn't this a beautiful day, Orko?

03:28.880 --> 03:30.370
Yeah, it sure is, Adam.

03:30.582 --> 03:34.313
Everything's calm and peaceful.

03:34.519 --> 03:36.514
I can't think of a thing that could ruin

03:36.539 --> 03:38.946
a nice day like today.

03:41.793 --> 03:43.590
What... w-w-w-what's that?

03:47.732 --> 03:50.257
It's coming from the lab. Let's go.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.699
Wait for me!

04:04.583 --> 04:06.278
That's it. Check each level.

04:09.321 --> 04:10.720
Where am I?

04:13.859 --> 04:16.019
Oh! My ears!
- Teela...

04:16.228 --> 04:17.524
What's going on?

04:17.896 --> 04:18.920
Man-At-Arms!

04:23.068 --> 04:24.626
Why all the noise?

04:25.237 --> 04:27.671
Adam!  You startled me.

04:27.873 --> 04:29.465
You don't have to yell, you know?

04:29.674 --> 04:30.834
Sorry, it's just that...

04:31.409 --> 04:32.706
What are you doing anyway?

04:32.844 --> 04:34.072
Not doing...

04:34.279 --> 04:35.610
We've done it.

04:48.827 --> 04:50.158
What's with him?

04:50.362 --> 04:51.811
Cringer's an animal just like those

04:51.836 --> 04:53.583
wild ones on Selkie Island.

04:53.899 --> 04:55.890
They can't stand the sound.

04:56.101 --> 04:57.659
Oh?  What sound?

04:57.969 --> 05:00.096
The one you're not hearing.

05:00.438 --> 05:01.803
I don't get it.

05:03.008 --> 05:04.339
It's simple, Orko.

05:04.342 --> 05:07.136
This Variable High-frequency Oscillator
oscillator goes up so high...

05:07.345 --> 05:09.142
only animals can hear it.

05:09.314 --> 05:11.874
And they don't like what they hear.
They run.

05:12.684 --> 05:15.012
Oh, I sure could have
figured that out myself.

05:16.288 --> 05:17.380
Emergency.

05:17.722 --> 05:18.689
Force...

05:18.890 --> 05:20.050
...failed. Man-At...

05:23.028 --> 05:25.121
If Hovar's force field
gives out before Teela...

05:25.297 --> 05:27.026
can get that VHO there...

05:27.232 --> 05:29.019
You can see for yourself, Adam.

05:29.044 --> 05:30.714
The animals will take over.

05:31.469 --> 05:32.959
But why is Teela going?

05:34.372 --> 05:37.273
Somebody has to take the responsibility.

05:40.845 --> 05:42.312
Is she taking the Wind Raider?

05:42.514 --> 05:44.675
No, landing would be too dangerous.

05:44.883 --> 05:45.850
Then, how?

05:46.017 --> 05:49.214
She's sailing in the newest,
fastest ship in the Eternian Navy.

05:49.487 --> 05:50.476
Oh boy!

05:52.424 --> 05:54.688
I wouldn't mind seeing that ship myself.

05:54.926 --> 05:56.086
Then why don't you go along?

05:56.294 --> 05:59.617
I mean, you never know when Teela
might need the help of He-Man.

06:09.207 --> 06:11.072
Standby to cast off!

06:11.409 --> 06:13.809
Anything you want me to
do while you're gone?

06:13.845 --> 06:15.979
How about keeping an eye
on Adam and seeing that...

06:16.181 --> 06:18.342
he stays out of trouble.

06:18.516 --> 06:20.484
Oh sure, I can do that.

06:22.954 --> 06:25.684
Well, I better put this VHO in my cabin.

06:26.057 --> 06:27.149
Bye, Orko.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.428
Bye, Teela, have a nice trip.

06:31.596 --> 06:33.154
Prepare to get on the way.

06:33.365 --> 06:34.923
You there!  Look alive.

06:45.510 --> 06:47.410
I wonder what makes it go?

06:51.916 --> 06:53.645
This ship's really moving.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.746
At this speed I'll be there in no time.

06:56.988 --> 06:58.046
Adam!

06:58.323 --> 06:59.722
What are you doing here?

06:59.924 --> 07:02.916
I uh... I guess I did'nt
want to miss all the fun.

07:04.763 --> 07:08.255
Well, now I have you to worry about.

07:11.736 --> 07:15.228
At last, the oscillator is on its way.

07:15.473 --> 07:19.967
Once I have it, I'll be able to
control every animal in Eternia.

07:21.079 --> 07:22.842
Even Beast Man.

07:23.214 --> 07:26.149
and perhaps... Skeletor himself!

07:32.991 --> 07:35.551
I can't believe how fast we're going.

07:36.327 --> 07:37.521
What was that?

07:37.996 --> 07:39.691
It feels as if we hit something.

07:40.031 --> 07:41.225
Look!

07:45.537 --> 07:46.731
Oh no!

07:46.938 --> 07:48.064
What is it?

07:51.643 --> 07:54.510
Kraken, the biggest sea monster on Eternia.

07:54.813 --> 07:57.213
The ship will be crushed
if we don't do something.

08:10.462 --> 08:13.158
This is getting a little
too crowded for me.

08:20.038 --> 08:22.768
By the power of Grayskull!

08:28.947 --> 08:33.212
I have the power!

08:36.154 --> 08:38.280
Now, to see what I can do with it.

08:39.591 --> 08:41.032
Didn't anyone ever tell you,

08:41.057 --> 08:42.966
it's not polite to grab?

08:45.530 --> 08:47.157
That Kraken is sinking the ship.

08:54.472 --> 08:56.497
-C'mon! Over here!
-Come over here.

08:56.674 --> 08:57.732
Come get over here, c'mon!

08:57.942 --> 08:59.409
-Let's go! -C'mon!

08:59.878 --> 09:01.812
The sailors are safe, but...

09:02.013 --> 09:03.344
I don't see Teela.

09:03.815 --> 09:05.373
Teela?  Where are you?

09:11.823 --> 09:13.347
I must find her.

09:22.734 --> 09:24.013
If Teela's trapped in there,

09:24.038 --> 09:25.591
maybe she's found an air pocket.

09:40.218 --> 09:41.685
The VHO is gone.

09:52.597 --> 09:53.689
Razorfins.

09:53.898 --> 09:55.889
They can eat their way through anything

10:08.313 --> 10:10.508
They're still with me.

10:39.844 --> 10:42.142
That wasn't a real fish,

10:42.380 --> 10:43.472
It was a...

10:43.681 --> 10:45.080
It was a robot.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.141
I wonder what's next?

10:50.255 --> 10:52.086
This must be a homing device.

10:52.323 --> 10:54.723
If I follow this signal,
maybe I'll find Teela...

10:54.993 --> 10:56.620
and a lot more.

10:57.528 --> 11:00.929
It's coming from that
direction and a long way off.

11:18.983 --> 11:20.949
The forcefield shield is weak,

11:20.974 --> 11:22.807
but it is holding for now.

11:22.987 --> 11:23.919
Father.

11:24.122 --> 11:25.324
This is the last laser and

11:25.349 --> 11:27.411
it's almost out of power.

11:27.592 --> 11:30.789
I - I'm beginning to
wish we never came here.

11:30.995 --> 11:33.520
Son, when King Randor
appointed me royal historian...

11:33.765 --> 11:35.494
it was a great honor...

11:35.667 --> 11:37.498
and it was my job to come here.

11:37.669 --> 11:39.536
I know, but these old ruins,

11:39.561 --> 11:42.027
they're nothing but a pile of junk.

11:42.507 --> 11:43.744
Perhaps to some,

11:43.769 --> 11:46.627
but once this was a beautiful city.

11:46.978 --> 11:49.503
Don't... don't you want to
find out who lived here?

11:49.681 --> 11:51.114
What happened to them?

11:51.416 --> 11:53.509
I guess, I mean I wanna learn and...

11:53.785 --> 11:57.312
someday I want to be,
well, just like you father.

11:57.488 --> 11:58.182
But...

11:58.389 --> 11:59.820
But right now, you're...

11:59.845 --> 12:02.110
Well we're, both a little frightened.

12:02.327 --> 12:05.057
Is that it?
Help will come, Justin.

12:05.263 --> 12:06.696
We must believe that.

12:06.864 --> 12:09.332
When we believe, anything is possible.

12:12.937 --> 12:14.063
Hello?  Anybody!

12:14.238 --> 12:16.433
This is Hovar, on the Island of Selkie.

12:16.874 --> 12:18.205
Can you hear me?

12:18.409 --> 12:21.538
We are in trouble.
Deep trouble.

12:32.757 --> 12:34.748
Oops, lost it.

13:19.971 --> 13:22.098
Boy, it's pretty dark in here.

13:24.242 --> 13:26.642
Is that really better, He-Man?

13:26.811 --> 13:29.245
Mer-Man, I should have known.

13:29.580 --> 13:31.707
You don't seem happy to see me...

13:31.916 --> 13:34.407
and why don't you say hello to your friend?

13:36.120 --> 13:37.144
Teela!

13:42.059 --> 13:44.118
Why don't you help her?

13:46.332 --> 13:47.663
Stop!

13:55.406 --> 13:56.464
The Kraken!

14:46.958 --> 14:48.118
No!

14:54.632 --> 14:55.758
Stop!

15:04.675 --> 15:06.734
How about a friendly little contest?

15:06.944 --> 15:09.037
With the winner getting to keep Teela.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.304
Why not?

15:11.916 --> 15:14.009
How can I lose?

15:14.418 --> 15:15.578
Then have at it!

15:16.754 --> 15:19.222
Nice try. Now, how about this?

15:27.999 --> 15:29.023
No!

15:29.667 --> 15:30.725
Yes.

15:31.903 --> 15:34.030
Now I'll just take Teela
and get out of here.

15:40.878 --> 15:42.505
Sorry I took so long.

15:42.713 --> 15:44.010
He's gone after the Kraken.

15:46.317 --> 15:47.750
Then we'd better get crackin'.

16:24.422 --> 16:25.738
I've got you now, He-Man.

16:25.763 --> 16:26.779
Both of you!

17:00.391 --> 17:02.416
Is that what you were looking for?

17:03.961 --> 17:04.858
Thanks.

17:05.061 --> 17:06.119
Now get back.

17:39.897 --> 17:42.195
And now, for a little Kraken throw.

17:46.270 --> 17:48.830
Well, that takes care of Mer-Man but...

17:49.040 --> 17:51.634
I dropped the VHO.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.276
Don't worry, I'll get it.

18:00.985 --> 18:02.009
He-Man!

18:02.486 --> 18:03.453
Hey!

18:03.654 --> 18:05.281
You can come back up now.

18:05.489 --> 18:06.615
Okay?

18:06.857 --> 18:07.949
He-Man?

18:08.125 --> 18:09.456
-Help!
Adam!

18:09.894 --> 18:11.054
Teela!

18:11.328 --> 18:12.989
Wow, am I glad to see you.

18:13.197 --> 18:15.099
But I thought... I mean...

18:15.124 --> 18:16.952
Where did you get that?

18:18.436 --> 18:21.269
You mean this? Well, uh...
He-Man gave it to me.

18:21.472 --> 18:24.168
Say, can we go ashore?

18:24.375 --> 18:25.854
I mean all this swimming,

18:25.879 --> 18:27.061
I'm really bushed?

18:38.589 --> 18:40.955
That's it, we have no more force-shield.

18:42.359 --> 18:43.951
And no more lasers.

18:46.430 --> 18:48.295
They're, they're coming!

18:48.466 --> 18:49.933
Stay close to me, son.

19:04.682 --> 19:06.445
Father!  It's Teela!

19:06.650 --> 19:08.049
And Adam!

19:08.452 --> 19:09.783
Oh thank goodness.

19:11.655 --> 19:13.646
Phew, sounds like we got here just in time.

19:14.558 --> 19:15.650
Sounds?

19:16.460 --> 19:19.395
That's funny. I don't hear anything.

19:24.735 --> 19:26.930
The VHO is working perfectly, Hovar.

19:27.138 --> 19:28.833
And you'll both be safe from now on.

19:29.039 --> 19:30.404
That's great.

19:30.641 --> 19:33.109
Now we can really get back to work...

19:33.310 --> 19:34.980
I mean, these old ruins were

19:35.005 --> 19:37.031
once a beautiful city, you know?

19:37.214 --> 19:38.795
We've got to find out who lived

19:38.820 --> 19:40.503
here and what happened to them.

19:40.684 --> 19:42.982
-Right, father?
That's right, son.

19:43.287 --> 19:45.346
I'm gonna get started right now.

19:59.370 --> 20:02.100
Well, you two!
I'd say that was a job well done.

20:02.439 --> 20:03.736
Thanks to He-Man.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.205
He saved me from the Kraken and Mer-Man.

20:06.577 --> 20:08.545
And he also saved the VHO.

20:08.846 --> 20:10.507
I thought you did.

20:10.948 --> 20:13.651
Huh?
Oh well... well I mean.

20:13.651 --> 20:16.142
Well, out there, that big ocean...

20:16.353 --> 20:17.581
all that water...

20:17.755 --> 20:20.849
Water?  Ocean?

20:21.058 --> 20:25.290
Oh, I'm glad I stayed home this time.

20:29.934 --> 20:31.635
Hovar and Justin certainly had

20:31.660 --> 20:33.416
a narrow escape, didn't they?

20:33.604 --> 20:34.827
But when one is an explorer

20:34.852 --> 20:36.119
or a scientist like Hovar,

20:36.307 --> 20:37.974
wild animals are only one of

20:37.999 --> 20:39.664
the many dangers you face.

20:39.844 --> 20:41.534
And yet, throughout the course of history

20:41.545 --> 20:43.740
there have been brave men and heroic women

20:43.948 --> 20:45.472
ready and eager to be the first

20:45.497 --> 20:47.203
to face the unknown,

20:47.384 --> 20:48.835
to challenge it's dangers so that

20:48.860 --> 20:50.309
others might follow without fear.

20:50.888 --> 20:52.216
It is to these unsung

20:52.241 --> 20:54.075
heroes that we owe so much.

20:54.258 --> 20:55.705
See you soon with another

20:55.730 --> 20:56.944
exciting adventure.
