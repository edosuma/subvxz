00:21.146 --> 00:22.272
Hi.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.067
What do you want?

00:25.984 --> 00:28.028
Look, I know we're at war,

00:28.111 --> 00:31.782
but I was hoping
that we could cease fire today

00:31.865 --> 00:35.661
and go to the funeral together,
in honor of Frazar.

00:36.703 --> 00:37.704
I'm not going.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.624
What are you talking about?
You have to go.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.292
Frazar was one of your classmates.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.629
-He was one of your best friends.
-I don't need you to tell me that.

00:45.712 --> 00:49.007
And I certainly don't need to watch Dad
pretending like he knew Frazar

00:49.091 --> 00:52.010
and using his death
to peacock to the town.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.221
I can mourn him myself.

00:54.304 --> 00:57.391
You know if you're not there,
the whole town will be talking about Dad.

00:57.474 --> 01:01.770
You're actually making this all about you.
Can't you think of the family for once?

01:04.022 --> 01:06.483
I have my own family now,
and I need to get back to them.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.569
Where's Sue?
She'll agree with me. I know it.

01:08.652 --> 01:12.114
Sue and I are
prioritizing our own child now.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.075
Maybe if you had children of your own,
you would understand.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.451
If I had children of my own,

01:16.535 --> 01:18.996
I would teach them to protect
their family's reputation

01:19.079 --> 01:20.706
and show up when it really matters.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.458
God, Emily. What happened to you?

01:23.542 --> 01:25.544
You used to be so…

01:26.837 --> 01:28.338
unconventional,

01:28.422 --> 01:31.049
and now you're just like Dad.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.677
Go on.

01:34.803 --> 01:39.558
Run along and hold Dad's hand.
Remember, you chose him, after all.

01:56.617 --> 02:01.205
Frazar Augustus Stearns was
an Amherst man through and through.

02:02.956 --> 02:07.377
Frazar embodied this town's spirit.
He was its flesh and blood.

02:08.127 --> 02:11.006
And though it pains me to say goodbye…

02:11.089 --> 02:12.090
Where's Austin?

02:13.342 --> 02:14.426
I don't know.

02:15.511 --> 02:16.845
It's crazy he's not here.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.056
It's crazy none of them are here.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.142
Can we please stop calling
everything crazy? It's offensive.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.269
Besides, Emily's here.

02:24.853 --> 02:29.107
A hero who has brought
great glory to this town.

02:29.191 --> 02:35.906
And so today, we dedicate this cannon
to him as a reminder of that glory.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.157
A cannon?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.117
For me?

02:40.244 --> 02:41.453
Frazar!

02:43.121 --> 02:45.040
-I'm Nobody.
-You're here.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.418
I couldn't exactly miss my own funeral.

02:52.422 --> 02:57.094
This cannon was there at New Bern,
where young Frazar laid down his life…

02:57.177 --> 02:58.804
Can you believe this guy?

02:58.887 --> 03:00.180
…for the soul of this nation.

03:00.264 --> 03:04.601
I'm sorry. I know he's your dad,
but it's so cheesy.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.520
He's just trying to honor you.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.606
That's the whole reason
you went to the war, remember?

03:10.482 --> 03:12.442
You're a little famous now,
Frazar Stearns.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.987
And when this war is over,

03:15.487 --> 03:18.615
and our nation is healing
from this great wound,

03:19.283 --> 03:23.620
it is the memories
of those like Frazar Stearns

03:23.704 --> 03:27.332
that will be our collective balm.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.627
So, what was it like?

03:31.295 --> 03:34.006
-What was what like?
-War.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.009
It was worse than I'd ever imagined.

03:38.177 --> 03:39.928
Like I went
straight into the jaws of hell,

03:40.012 --> 03:42.514
in the darkest inferno there is.

03:42.598 --> 03:43.557
Like Dante.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.894
Yeah, just like Dante.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.229
-And what did you find there?
-The truth.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.233
The rawest, the ugliest truth.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.943
There's no hiding in war.

03:55.027 --> 03:58.071
You think you're facing an enemy
when really you're facing yourself.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.575
Well, you're not the only one
who's been at war.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.620
So I hear. I'm sorry about you and Austin.

04:04.703 --> 04:08.457
It's fine.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.627
Everything's turned out for the best.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.213
I've learned a lot actually.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.756
Really? Like what?

04:16.548 --> 04:20.511
Well, I've learned
that my brother is a hopeless mess,

04:20.594 --> 04:22.346
and we're all better off without him.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.058
Sure, Mom and Vinnie are still
in the processing phase,

04:26.141 --> 04:28.519
but Dad and I are stronger than ever.

04:28.602 --> 04:33.106
Please bear to your comrades in arms
our most heartfelt acknowledgement…

04:33.190 --> 04:35.567
I've honestly never felt
more hope for this family.

04:36.985 --> 04:37.986
What?

04:38.070 --> 04:41.490
-I'm sorry. I'm not sure I believe you.
-What do you mean?

04:42.533 --> 04:44.993
This hope of yours
just rings a little false.

04:45.077 --> 04:48.872
"…mortally wounded
as he was cheering on the men

04:48.956 --> 04:53.335
to charge upon the enemy
across the railroad."

05:08.559 --> 05:11.812
Yes, sir. Thank you for coming.
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.897
Edward, there you are.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.567
That was one heck of a speech.
Fabulous job.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.569
Really splendid.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.404
Thank you, Ithamar.
I'm pleased you think so.

05:20.487 --> 05:24.992
Indeed, I do. And I must say,
I am sorry that I ever doubted you.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.494
You are as Union-blooded as they come.

05:27.578 --> 05:31.373
Yes. And it pains me to think
that anyone ever thought otherwise.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.961
Well, you know how the town
loves a good comeback story.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.297
I'm just sorry your family
wasn't here to see it.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.383
-But we were.
-Evelina!

05:41.466 --> 05:44.636
I was just congratulating your father
on his excellent eulogy.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.305
Yes, it was brilliant, wasn't it?

05:46.388 --> 05:48.557
Lincoln himself couldn't have
said it better.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.017
Indeed not.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.227
You have always been
good on the stump, Edward.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.271
It makes one wonder
why you ever left politics.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.564
I don't know about that.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.358
Something to think about, perhaps?

05:59.026 --> 06:01.653
A good day to both of you.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.363
Good day, Conkey.

06:05.407 --> 06:08.911
-Well done, Dad. You crushed it.
-You really think so?

06:08.994 --> 06:09.995
Absolutely.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.664
I've never been more proud
to be your daughter.

06:14.249 --> 06:17.503
Come on. Let's take a nice long walk home.
The spring flowers are coming out.

06:17.586 --> 06:18.587
Okay.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.549
Mr. Dickinson.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.232
Sue, you came.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.442
-Yeah, of course I did.
-Without your husband.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.986
He's watching the baby.
We've officially dispensed

06:43.070 --> 06:44.988
with predetermined gender roles
in our household.

06:46.949 --> 06:50.077
Am I right in thinking the two of you
are still editing Drum Beat?

06:50.160 --> 06:52.996
You mean President Lincoln's
favorite newspaper?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.624
We most certainly are. Why?

06:56.208 --> 06:59.586
I would like to submit something,
anonymously.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.347
-That was fun.
-Yes.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.768
I've never had a conversation
with daffodils before.

07:14.852 --> 07:18.230
You should try it more often. I've always
found them to be very good listeners.

07:18.313 --> 07:21.984
Yes, they kept nodding
their heads to everything I said.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.319
It was most agreeable.

07:27.322 --> 07:30.117
You know, Em, there's something
I've been meaning to talk to you about.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.118
What is it?

07:31.201 --> 07:34.079
It's something rather important
I like to ask you to do for me.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.334
What I can do - I will -
Though it be little as a Daffodil -

07:39.418 --> 07:41.545
Daffodil, very clever.

07:41.628 --> 07:45.507
Yes--
Could you step into my office? Come on.

07:48.552 --> 07:49.720
Apologies for the mess.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.555
Looks like the place got ransacked.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.766
Yes. It turns out
legacy-making is hard work.

07:54.850 --> 07:59.354
But I think I finally figured out
what I'm leaving behind and to whom,

07:59.438 --> 08:01.398
which is actually why I need you.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.525
Okay.

08:03.609 --> 08:06.153
I want you to be the executor of my will.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.822
-Me?
-Yes, you.

08:08.906 --> 08:11.700
I know it's an unusual request.

08:12.451 --> 08:16.455
But, you see, an executor must be
someone of sound mind and body,

08:17.039 --> 08:21.001
someone who can carry out
your wishes to the letter,

08:21.084 --> 08:23.670
someone who can speak for you
when you are no longer able,

08:23.754 --> 08:26.632
someone who you trust
with your whole heart.

08:29.510 --> 08:32.179
Dad. I never knew you saw me that way.

08:32.260 --> 08:35.807
Yes. Typically,
the role would fall to the eldest son,

08:35.890 --> 08:39.436
but, well, things have
turned out differently in this family.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.731
Well, don't worry, Father.

08:44.107 --> 08:48.862
One son at your service.
Perhaps you never noticed him before.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.740
I confess, I did not.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.075
But it's never too late.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.202
-Please, do have a seat.
-Yes, thank you.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.912
No, my pleasure.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.499
-Sir.
-Yes. Good lad, good lad.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.834
Be quick now.

09:03.585 --> 09:04.711
All right?

09:05.295 --> 09:07.422
-Ready when you are, Father.
-Excellent.

09:08.090 --> 09:12.177
I, Edward Dickinson,
being of sound mind and judgment…

09:14.513 --> 09:19.977
do declare this to be
my last will and testament.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.357
Attention!

10:26.251 --> 10:27.336
Well, shit.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.406
Emily.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.575
Did you get that last bequeathment?

10:58.659 --> 11:01.203
Yes, of course. Sorry-- Yes.

11:01.286 --> 11:04.665
"The sum of $1,000 shall be bequeathed
to Amherst College Trust."

11:04.748 --> 11:05.874
-Good.
-Yes.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.086
-I thought I lost you there for a moment.
-Dad, you know what I was thinking?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.047
You should really set up a scholarship.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.215
A scholarship?

11:13.715 --> 11:18.762
Yes. What better way to expand your legacy
portfolio than by investing in people?

11:18.846 --> 11:20.931
Not everything
has to be a name on a building.

11:22.558 --> 11:25.435
Why, that's brilliant. Just brilliant.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.982
Goodness. Austin would have
never thought of something like that.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.275
Well…

11:32.568 --> 11:34.236
You know, Em…

11:36.321 --> 11:39.199
I have come to realize
what a lucky man I am.

11:40.242 --> 11:43.078
I have to admit, I've felt abandoned
by this family as of late,

11:43.161 --> 11:44.663
but never by you.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.665
You've always been loyal to me,

11:47.541 --> 11:50.127
even though I've not always
been worthy of it.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.756
You have had to forgive me for a lot.

11:56.633 --> 12:00.304
And I want you to know that I will go
to my deathbed grateful for that.

12:00.387 --> 12:05.350
All I want-- All I've ever wanted
is to make you happy.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.812
I know, Dad. Thank you.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.649
You and I both care so much
about this family.

12:12.733 --> 12:13.734
It's true.

12:14.818 --> 12:18.488
And I know how hard it is for you
with your brother on the opposing side.

12:19.865 --> 12:22.701
We need to make sure
nothing like that ever happens between us.

12:23.660 --> 12:27.122
No. Nothing will ever divide us.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.166
It won't.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.185
So, we're almost done.

12:48.769 --> 12:52.689
-Yes. We just need the very last clause.
-That's right.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.359
-Hit me.
-Okay.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.445
The family home.

12:58.529 --> 13:00.280
280 Main Street, Amherst…

13:01.907 --> 13:06.787
along with all the rest of my possessions,
such that remain,

13:08.539 --> 13:11.208
shall be bequeathed to…

13:13.877 --> 13:17.381
my son, William Austin Dickinson, Esq.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.478
My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun -

13:32.062 --> 13:37.442
And in the event of his death, they shall
be bequeathed to his son, the…

13:37.526 --> 13:38.569
My goodness.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.949
That boy doesn't even have a name yet,
does he?

13:44.658 --> 13:46.952
Just put down "his eldest son."

13:48.829 --> 13:50.914
In Corners - till a Day

13:52.457 --> 13:53.542
Imagine that.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.420
Your little unnamed nephew

13:56.503 --> 13:59.006
could very well end up
being your guardian one day.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.301
How funny life is.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.804
The Owner passed - identified -

14:07.848 --> 14:09.850
And carried Me away.

14:11.435 --> 14:13.437
What is the matter, my dear?

14:14.354 --> 14:15.939
Are you really telling me…

14:17.774 --> 14:19.902
that you're giving everything to Austin?

14:22.613 --> 14:23.822
Just like that?

14:25.157 --> 14:28.035
After all that's happened?
Every single thing?

14:28.952 --> 14:29.995
But of course.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.916
Who else would it go to?

14:36.502 --> 14:37.503
You women?

14:38.086 --> 14:41.006
And now We roam in Sovreign Woods

14:42.132 --> 14:43.509
And now We hunt the Doe -

14:45.219 --> 14:47.387
And every time I speak for Him

14:48.847 --> 14:50.516
Imagine how that would look,

14:51.475 --> 14:53.143
if I left everything to my daughter.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.479
The bank would likely
tear the will right up.

14:55.562 --> 14:59.066
They would think I was insane.
Women can't own property.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.568
No, Em, it has something to do
with how emotional they are.

15:01.652 --> 15:04.112
They simply can't be trusted
to make their own decisions.

15:04.196 --> 15:06.240
That's why they need to be left
in a man's care,

15:06.323 --> 15:09.910
if not my own, then Austin's.
And if not his, then his son's.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.204
The men of this family
shall remain in charge,

15:12.287 --> 15:15.249
hopefully, for many generations to come.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.876
I mean, you women are blessed

15:17.960 --> 15:21.088
not to have the burden of independence
on your shoulders.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.051
Not to worry though, my dear.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.720
You will be well taken care of.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.058
And in any case, I assure you,

15:33.141 --> 15:36.144
this is perfectly in keeping
with Massachusetts law.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.609
The Mountains straight reply -

15:45.028 --> 15:48.740
You know, I grew up thinking…

15:50.784 --> 15:54.872
how lucky I am to have
such an incredible man for a father.

15:56.790 --> 16:00.627
A man of ambition, a man of great power,

16:01.170 --> 16:02.713
who could do amazing things,

16:02.796 --> 16:04.882
who could change the world.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.972
But the truth is…

16:16.643 --> 16:17.978
you're nothing like that.

16:18.729 --> 16:19.938
I'm sorry, what?

16:21.231 --> 16:24.610
You are nothing but a scared sheep.

16:26.278 --> 16:31.700
You have no power
to change anything because you…

16:33.869 --> 16:35.704
you have no imagination.

16:37.247 --> 16:42.503
And for that reason, no one will ever know
or care who you were.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.176
I made a mistake.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.892
Austin was right about you.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.897
I was wrong.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.611
Em.

17:08.278 --> 17:11.281
And do I smile such cordial light

17:13.951 --> 17:15.577
Upon the Valley glow -

17:18.872 --> 17:20.832
It is as a Vesuvian face

17:22.791 --> 17:25.045
Had let its pleasure through -

17:25.127 --> 17:26.380
-Watch out!
-Oh, my God!

17:26.463 --> 17:29.049
-Betty, I'm so sorry. I wasn't looking.
-You need to pay attention.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.843
Things just keep getting worse and worse.

17:30.926 --> 17:33.345
-If you'll excuse me.
-Betty, just tell me how you do it.

17:33.428 --> 17:34.513
Please.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.099
How? How do you keep it all together?

17:38.141 --> 17:40.602
Because this world is so messed up,
and honestly,

17:41.478 --> 17:42.896
I'm not sure I can do it anymore.

17:42.980 --> 17:48.151
I'm sorry. I just can't.
What makes you think I have time for this?

17:48.861 --> 17:51.446
-Betty, what's wrong?
-What's wrong is I just found out

17:51.530 --> 17:53.574
that Henry has joined
a regiment in the south.

17:53.657 --> 17:57.119
-He wrote to you.
-No! I had to hear it from the mailman.

17:57.202 --> 18:00.539
Apparently, Henry is perfectly capable
of writing letters,

18:00.622 --> 18:01.748
just not to his family.

18:01.832 --> 18:04.418
So, not only is Helen
about to lose her father,

18:04.501 --> 18:07.087
but he doesn't even care enough
to tell us about it.

18:07.171 --> 18:09.298
No, no. He cares, I'm sure he cares.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.676
He loves you, Betty, and he loves Helen.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.678
And at least you know where he is now.

18:14.761 --> 18:18.390
There's a Confederate army approaching
them, and they don't even have guns.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.101
-Betty, I'm so sorry.
-I don't need your pity!

18:21.685 --> 18:25.522
No, I didn't mean that--
Look, I am not thinking clearly right now.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.316
I just got into a fight with my dad.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.400
-And then--
-Yes!

18:28.483 --> 18:33.238
Well, I'm sorry that your family
is so busy destroying itself.

18:33.322 --> 18:36.366
But meanwhile,
the world has already destroyed mine.

18:36.450 --> 18:37.868
Betty, you have to stay hopeful.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.579
Hope? Hope is a lie!

18:40.662 --> 18:44.374
Emily, you spend one day
in my shoes, you'll understand that.

18:44.458 --> 18:47.878
Go ahead. Write all the poems you want.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.838
It doesn't change anything.

18:50.714 --> 18:52.549
I want nothing to do with hope.

18:53.217 --> 18:54.218
Nothing.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.929
All hope ever did was make me cry.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.641
Betty.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.856
And when at Night -
Our good Day done -

19:08.398 --> 19:10.317
I guard My Master's Head -

19:10.943 --> 19:12.861
'Tis better than the Eider-Duck's

19:12.945 --> 19:15.697
Deep Pillow - to have shared -

19:15.781 --> 19:18.450
To foe of His - I'm deadly foe -

19:18.534 --> 19:20.202
None stir the second time -

19:24.748 --> 19:27.000
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye -

19:27.084 --> 19:28.627
Or an emphatic Thumb -

19:29.920 --> 19:32.673
Though I than He - may longer live

19:32.756 --> 19:35.217
He longer must - than I -

19:55.320 --> 19:58.574
For I have but the power to kill

20:01.034 --> 20:04.454
Without - the power to die -

20:29.688 --> 20:30.689
You made it.

20:35.986 --> 20:36.987
A pit?

20:39.323 --> 20:40.324
An inferno.

20:43.869 --> 20:45.412
"Abandon all hope."

20:46.914 --> 20:49.875
Abandon all hope,
and you find where true hope lies,

20:49.958 --> 20:51.460
the one place you haven't looked,

20:52.794 --> 20:54.296
the darkest place of all.

20:56.215 --> 20:57.216
Are you ready?

20:57.799 --> 20:58.967
I hope so.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.136
After you.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.316
Wait!

21:15.359 --> 21:16.360
Frazar?

21:18.028 --> 21:19.029
Nobody?

22:20.132 --> 22:21.633
Vinnie!

22:22.134 --> 22:23.135
It's you.

22:24.469 --> 22:25.679
What are you doing here?

22:25.762 --> 22:27.139
What does it look like?

22:27.222 --> 22:29.224
I'm trying to keep
all of my husbands alive.

22:30.309 --> 22:31.602
These are all of your husbands?

22:31.685 --> 22:34.479
All of them and none of them,
thanks to you.

22:34.563 --> 22:35.647
Thanks to me?

22:36.231 --> 22:38.358
Yes, you.

22:38.442 --> 22:41.528
If I hadn't spent my whole life
listening to you preach

22:41.612 --> 22:45.324
about being a free, creative spirit,
I would have found true love.

22:45.407 --> 22:50.037
But no, you had to make me think about
art and poetry and all of that garbage

22:50.120 --> 22:52.247
when I should have stayed focused
on getting married.

22:54.625 --> 22:56.251
-Wait, are those--
-Your poems?

22:56.335 --> 22:59.087
Yes. And you know what?
I think I will burn them.

22:59.171 --> 23:01.840
-That's all they're really good for.
-No. No!

23:01.924 --> 23:03.217
No, Vinnie, stop!

23:03.300 --> 23:07.554
No, you stop. Stop distracting me
from what really matters.

23:08.138 --> 23:11.016
Stop ruining my chance at happiness.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.062
Poor baby.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.112
Emily.

23:52.891 --> 23:55.102
Austin? Austin, wait.
Where are you taking me?

23:55.185 --> 23:58.188
I'm sorry, Emily, but you're crazy.
It's time for you to be locked up.

23:58.272 --> 23:59.565
What? Why?

23:59.648 --> 24:01.900
So you can't do to anyone
what you did to me.

24:01.984 --> 24:03.944
What? What did I do?

24:04.027 --> 24:07.239
You know full well you're the reason
my marriage is a disaster.

24:07.322 --> 24:09.825
Austin, that's not fair.
You knew I loved Sue.

24:09.908 --> 24:13.328
Not like that, I didn't.
And besides, you don't love Sue.

24:13.412 --> 24:17.291
You love writing poems about loving Sue.
Your poems are all you care about.

24:17.374 --> 24:18.500
That's not true.

24:18.584 --> 24:20.252
Yes, it is. You know it is.

24:20.335 --> 24:22.713
Austin, I love Sue. And I love you.

24:22.796 --> 24:25.340
If that were true,
you would've given us a chance.

24:25.424 --> 24:29.094
But instead, you kept writing her poems.
You couldn't stop yourself, could you?

24:29.178 --> 24:31.847
Each one, a tiny drop of poison.

24:31.930 --> 24:35.392
Each one slowly killing any hope
we had of happiness.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.603
Austin.

24:39.396 --> 24:41.190
I swear, I never meant to hurt you.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.067
You didn't hurt me, Emily.

24:45.402 --> 24:46.820
You destroyed me.

24:55.787 --> 24:59.374
I'm alone and scared, Emily.
I lost my mommy.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.919
-Mom?
-Will you feed me, Emily?

25:04.046 --> 25:05.297
Oh, God.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.420
Dad.

25:47.381 --> 25:48.382
Dad?

25:51.343 --> 25:52.386
Dad.

25:53.971 --> 25:55.347
Oh, my God.

25:56.306 --> 25:57.933
No. No.

25:58.016 --> 26:00.394
No, no, no! Dad!

26:00.477 --> 26:02.813
Dad, no. No, no, no.

26:02.896 --> 26:04.314
Emily.

26:05.983 --> 26:11.864
He's dead.

26:11.947 --> 26:14.700
Yeah. And now we can be together.

26:14.783 --> 26:17.411
Oh, no. It is my fault.
It's my fault. I killed him.

26:18.036 --> 26:20.122
Say your goodbyes and come with me.

26:28.964 --> 26:29.965
I'm sorry.

26:31.341 --> 26:32.342
I am.

27:07.044 --> 27:10.005
Look. It's just you and me now.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.469
It's perfect.

28:56.570 --> 28:58.280
You know, maybe we shouldn't--

28:58.363 --> 29:02.659
Don't worry, Emily.
No one can see us down here. We're safe.

29:02.743 --> 29:05.120
That's not what I meant. It's just…

29:05.204 --> 29:07.915
What? You don't even want to kiss me?

29:07.998 --> 29:10.375
No, of course I do. Of course I do.
It's just--

29:11.043 --> 29:12.377
You seem a little--

29:12.461 --> 29:14.713
I knew it.
You're not attracted to me anymore.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.423
You're putting words in my mouth.

29:16.507 --> 29:19.259
Then let me put something else in there.

29:19.927 --> 29:21.720
Wait, oh, my God.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.472
-Oh, God, Sue!
-Get off me, Emily!

29:28.101 --> 29:30.020
There was never any hope for us,
was there?

29:30.103 --> 29:32.856
-What do you mean?
-Don't touch me ever again.

29:35.484 --> 29:36.527
Sue, wait.

31:01.612 --> 31:02.654
Fire!

31:10.746 --> 31:11.788
Henry!

31:25.010 --> 31:27.137
Charge!

31:43.362 --> 31:45.239
No. Henry!

31:59.586 --> 32:01.171
Come on, Henry!

32:01.255 --> 32:03.340
Do not give up! Keep fighting!

32:06.301 --> 32:08.053
Your family needs you.

32:24.278 --> 32:25.445
We're winning!

32:26.029 --> 32:27.906
Victory is ours!

32:42.838 --> 32:44.339
Oh, God.
