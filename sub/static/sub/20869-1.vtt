I'm coming for you, Boyo!

Get him! Dave, go to him!

Come on, Joe!

- Noah.
- Hmm?

02:45.499 --> 02:48.627
What is Jon doing on my couch?

02:48.794 --> 02:50.420

<i>- Just take it seriously, OK?

It's just a dodgy carb, I reckon.

- You know, the battery is...
- You know it's over, right?

03:22.244 --> 03:26.373
Come on, man. I mean, you guys
gotta know where she is, right?

I just gotta talk to her.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.060
Yeah, I know.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.868
<i>- She was absolutely devastated.</i>
- I know.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.272
Yeah, I know, I know.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.840

What have you done
with my crane brothers suit?

06:45.322 --> 06:46.656
You said borrow anything.

Yeah, I meant like golf clubs

I'm sorry about that.

Oh.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.188
Thanks, man.

08:05.694 --> 08:09.781
Man, you wouldn't believe my morning.
My car shat its gearbox.

08:09.948 --> 08:13.451
And then I had this,
like, uh, catastrophic governor failure.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.411
Have you ever had one of those?

08:18.623 --> 08:21.542
Yeah, no, you don't want to.
Trust me. It's a miracle I'm not toast.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.670
Uh, bro, it's a miracle
you're not mince.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.357
Yeah, man. Yeah, true. Thank you.
Thanks for not making me that.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.884
"A shit sandwich without the bread"?

11:17.051 --> 11:19.178
What kind of feedback is that?

11:20.263 --> 11:21.973
It's a metaphor.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.560
Like imagine a sandwich
with just the shit bits...

11:25.727 --> 11:27.895
- Yeah.
- ..And no bread.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.730

- It's pretty shit.

thanks for clarifying that.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.985
You're welcome.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.451
Let me tell you
what it really is, OK?

11:41.618 --> 11:46.118
It's a conspiracy to make me conform
to this bland commercial standard.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.144
All those condescending morons,
they just...

11:50.168 --> 11:52.837
They want derivative pulp,
and I'm not going to sell out, man.

11:53.004 --> 11:57.341
I'm... I'm not.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.106
Yep. Here we go.
Speaking of conspiracies...

12:15.026 --> 12:18.279
Afternoon, sir. Do you know
why I pulled you over?

12:19.322 --> 12:22.575
Well, the Rego's all good, so I guess
you're just revenue collecting, officer.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.077
Or another probable cause is...

12:25.245 --> 12:27.645
Another probable cause is
institutionalized racism, you know?

12:27.705 --> 12:29.745
Perhaps you just pulled him over
because he's Maori.

12:33.836 --> 12:34.878
Sorry, sir.

12:35.046 --> 12:39.546
His... his cat got run over this morning,
so he's a bit upset, yeah.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.594
Mmm.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.388
Was it desexed?

12:44.555 --> 12:46.598
- What?
- Your cat.

12:46.766 --> 12:50.728
Oh. Um... no.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.231
Desexed cats are less likely to stray,
therefore less likely to be run over.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.275
You might wanna consider that
next time.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.528
OK, yeah.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.492
This vehicle left a taihape service
station without paying for petrol.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.577
You know about that?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.496
- Nah, he paid for that.
- What?

13:09.664 --> 13:11.165
- The petrol.
- Nah, I didn't.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.833
I thought you did, didn't you?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.752
No, you said
you'd Chuck it in, bro, so I...

13:14.919 --> 13:16.587
I would never say
"Chuck it in, bro."

13:16.754 --> 13:21.254
So this vehicle is registered to
jock Stevens. Either of you him?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.726
Hey, what are you doing?

13:30.893 --> 13:32.895
Dude, what are you doing?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.148
Man, are you
in some kind of trouble?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.359
Well, who fills up a car
and doesn't pay for it?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.444
Who's got a mum called jock?

13:57.545 --> 14:00.965
OK, well, if you don't pull over soon,
you're gonna lose your license.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.051
I don't have one.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.054
Whoa!

14:07.221 --> 14:08.889
Wh...! Whoa!

14:10.224 --> 14:11.892
Oh! Ahh.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.688
Ahh.

14:23.529 --> 14:27.074
OK, Evel Knievel, maybe you could
just, um, ease off the pedal a little bit.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.827
Ooh!

14:45.134 --> 14:46.635
Where'd he go?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.140
Fuck!

15:01.192 --> 15:03.444
It's not your mum's mini, is it?

15:05.279 --> 15:07.364
I feel like a burger.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.242
What?

15:10.284 --> 15:13.328
A flame-grilled Angus Patty,
runny egg and barbecue sauce.

15:13.496 --> 15:14.580
Seriously?

15:15.623 --> 15:18.208
Well, you got a better plan?

15:19.460 --> 15:20.586
No.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.130
Let's get a burger.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.107
That's six double-beef bacon, people.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.151
What's the hold-up?
You growing those bloody cows?

15:44.318 --> 15:45.569
We apologise, sir.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.132
We've just had one out the back that
refused to be blended up in the mincer,

15:48.156 --> 15:51.075
but we smacked her around and
you can stuff your face with her shortly.

15:51.242 --> 15:54.161
- I have order 97 here.
- Oh, there you go. Nice and bloody.

15:54.328 --> 15:58.498

fucking kids in the car.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.590

handsome. What can I do you for?</i>

16:06.757 --> 16:08.925

16:09.969 --> 16:14.181
What...? Mm. Uh... I'm a...
Yeah, I'm a little bit torn.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.351
Bro, she's talking to me.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.937
- She <i>asked me</i> my <i>order.
- I was talking to the driver, sir.</i>

16:20.104 --> 16:22.523
<i>- Oh. That's fine. Sorry.
- Tends to be how it works.</i>

16:24.192 --> 16:27.403
Uh, well, can I grab
the flame-grilled Angus Patty

16:27.570 --> 16:29.863
with runny egg
and extra bacon, please?

16:30.031 --> 16:31.532
<i>- Absolutely.
- Thanks.</i>

16:31.699 --> 16:33.033
<i>And you, sir?</i>

16:33.201 --> 16:35.411
Um, yeah, and I'll get
the flame-grilled cheese, thanks.

<i>- So that's the flame-grilled cheese...
- Oh, but no cheese.</i>

16:37.955 --> 16:40.749
Actually, no, should just make it
the Fla... Flame-grilled original.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.294
<i>- Without cheese?
- Without cheese, yep.</i>

16:43.461 --> 16:46.088
- And no... oh, does it have tomato?
- Yes.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.258
OK, cool. No, I don't want any of that.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.593
Some dick stuffed up my order.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.346
- Huh?
- Some dick stuffed up his order.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.350
Sorry. Uh, can I offer you
a free coke?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.101
Nah. How about some free chips?

16:59.268 --> 17:02.396
- Nah, how about a free burger?
- Nah, how about a free blow job?

17:04.272 --> 17:06.525
I'm sorry. We only offer free coke.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.858
- What the fuck?!
- Did you want to supersize those?

17:09.987 --> 17:12.446
Fuck, no!

17:20.373 --> 17:23.959
Uh, I might cancel my coke order.

17:25.002 --> 17:28.880
You might have to tell someone else.
I don't think I work here anymore.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.425
Do you want
a double coke with that?

17:31.592 --> 17:33.677
Oh, do you need a lift somewhere?

17:33.844 --> 17:35.322
You're not going to Wellington,
are you?

17:35.346 --> 17:37.264
Uh, yeah, we are.

17:38.808 --> 17:39.850
Choice.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.061
- Wait, what's going on?
- It looks like she's in trouble.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.481
Yeah, so are you, mate.
You don't want any more.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.232
Alright.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.402
Whoa!

17:50.778 --> 17:51.862
- Whoa...
- Um...

17:52.029 --> 17:53.238
- Whoa!
- Gosh!

17:53.406 --> 17:54.949
Sorry! Jesus, I'm sorry.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.868
Oh!

18:00.746 --> 18:03.331
Keira1 oh! Oh! Sorry!

18:03.499 --> 18:05.918
- Oh, god.
- Oh, shit.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.796
My bad. Whoo!

18:08.963 --> 18:12.967
- Well, that was insane.
- Yeah, it certainly was unusual.

18:14.010 --> 18:18.222
Oh, uh, we've got the flame-grilled
Angus the cow right here.

18:18.389 --> 18:19.556
Cool. Thank you.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.392
And that is the regular Patty,

18:21.559 --> 18:24.103
no cheese, no tomato
or anything interesting at all.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.980
Perfect.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.404
- Hey, what's this?
- Oh, read it.

18:33.571 --> 18:37.074
"How much meat
is in your meat?" What?

18:37.241 --> 18:39.159
"Once you account
for the water content,

18:39.327 --> 18:41.829
"crushed bone matter
and high-fructose corn syrup,

18:41.996 --> 18:44.665
"only 4% of your Patty
is actually meat."

18:44.832 --> 18:47.501
That... "Statistically,
there'll be a mix-up in supply

18:47.668 --> 18:50.629
"which means 50% of that meat
content is actually horsemeat."

18:50.796 --> 18:52.589
Horsemeat. Correct.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.518
What kind of sadistic nutjob would
put that in their burger packaging?

18:55.593 --> 18:57.177
I did. And it's factual.

18:57.345 --> 19:01.807
So what? What are you, some kind
of undercover... Vegan activist?

19:01.974 --> 19:05.102
Not really. I mean, I wore these
to my job interview last week.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.895
"Not your mum, not your milk."

19:07.063 --> 19:09.106
I never hide my beliefs.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.276
- Gotta have principles, bro.
- That's rich coming from you.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.403
Wait. OK, OK, so...

19:14.570 --> 19:16.965
what if someone's just, like,
innocently eating their burger

19:16.989 --> 19:19.199
and then they come across
your pamphlet and then, boom,

19:19.367 --> 19:21.702
they hurl all over their nan
or their friend or something?

19:21.869 --> 19:23.453
Whoa!

19:28.709 --> 19:31.628
Um... What are we doing?

19:32.672 --> 19:35.299
Oh, we're just checking out
the local shops.

19:36.384 --> 19:39.178
Sarah's souvenir stall?

19:39.345 --> 19:41.680
Yeah, he really likes
kiwi fruit jam.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.390
Really?

19:43.557 --> 19:45.100
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.

19:46.477 --> 19:50.230

Oh, you want to? $5. Yeah.
Oh, yeah, let's get some.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.238

of intellectual property

- Come on.

know, satisfies in other ways, right?

It's... it's Halloween, right?

26:46.814 --> 26:47.981
No. We're, um...

26:48.148 --> 26:50.877
We're marching on parliament tomorrow
to protest the death of animal rights.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.546
There's this horrific bill in front
of the house that needs stopping.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.822
Yeah, no, it's great.
You should do, like, a barbecue.

- No.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.635
OK, well, let me know

27:17.803 --> 27:19.721

27:45.539 --> 27:48.917

They're marching already.

29:45.075 --> 29:46.159

- Come on.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.886
- What? Where are we going?
- The march.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.661
Is that Jon?

31:11.828 --> 31:13.830
Oi!
Hey, watch where you're going!

31:13.997 --> 31:15.415
Holy <i>sh...</i>

31:15.582 --> 31:16.708
Ohhh!

31:16.875 --> 31:18.585
Ohh.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.628
On!
On?

31:24.758 --> 31:26.509
- Quick, get in the back.
- What?

31:26.676 --> 31:29.345
- Get in the back.
- Oh, my god, Luke.

31:29.513 --> 31:33.517
Ah, now the protest... oh, shit.

31:33.683 --> 31:36.102
I think I need a coffee,

31:36.269 --> 31:39.188
um, or maybe just like
a blue powerade or something.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.447
Watch out!

31:47.614 --> 31:50.074
Just trying to get my seat belt on.

31:53.370 --> 31:56.081
Oh, that's me. I'll get it.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.291
Luke!
You'll lose your license!

31:58.458 --> 31:59.458
Hey, Noah.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.711
Bro, so I heard about the wedding.
Well done.

32:01.878 --> 32:04.278
That was an impressive balls-up,
even by your high standards.

32:04.381 --> 32:07.175
You know, you could have told me
that she was dating an ubermensch.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.890
What are you talking about?

32:14.057 --> 32:18.186
The blonde guy
in the fruity suit, man.

32:18.353 --> 32:21.689
Oh, OK. No, that would've been Hugo,
Nick's brother. He's gay.

32:21.857 --> 32:24.442
She's dating a gay guy? What
the fuck? How's that gonna work?

32:24.609 --> 32:26.485
No, you dick, not dating him.

32:26.653 --> 32:30.073
Hugo was Suzie's support person
at the wedding.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.240
- Ah!
- Oh!

32:31.324 --> 32:33.034
She's still cut up
about it all, mate.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.801
- Argh!
- Where the hell are you, anyway?

32:34.911 --> 32:37.038
- What are those sirens?
- Um, that's just movies.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.207
- You know, it's a car chase.
- Let me out!

32:40.834 --> 32:43.711
How do you even know all this?

32:44.754 --> 32:46.422
Mrs D rang me.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.592
And, shit, bro, you're bloody lucky

32:48.758 --> 32:50.885
she's deleted your number
'cause the old girl let rip,

32:51.052 --> 32:55.389
and now I'm to tell you to
stay away from her daughter.

32:55.557 --> 32:56.557
No!

32:56.600 --> 32:58.101
No!

32:58.268 --> 33:02.063
I know, bro,
but I warned you not to go, OK?

33:02.230 --> 33:04.106
She flew down south
to Mrs D's this morning,

33:04.274 --> 33:06.609
and then she's taken
some flash job.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.652
<i>Oh... Shit!</i>

33:08.820 --> 33:09.987
Yeah, afraid so.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.532
- Just let it go, dude.
- Right here!

33:12.699 --> 33:15.076
Hey, the background noise
is killing me, mate.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.744
Call me back
after you finish watching

33:16.912 --> 33:18.723
that shitty Michael bay flick
or whatever it is.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.957
Whoa! Whoa!

33:22.292 --> 33:23.835
Oh, my god!

33:27.088 --> 33:30.132
- Wanker!
- Luke, slow down!

33:32.844 --> 33:35.346
Ooh!

33:40.936 --> 33:44.356
Oh, bro, can you speed that vom up?
We have a situation here.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.650
Oh!

33:51.488 --> 33:54.365
- Really? Ohh.
- Oh, man.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.846
Here they are!

34:20.016 --> 34:23.601
Freedom of sheep!
Ban live exports!

34:26.690 --> 34:28.983
Shit, what are you doing?
We're meant to join them.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.944
- Hugo's gay.
- Luke, stop!

34:32.112 --> 34:33.987
What are you doing?

34:34.155 --> 34:36.532
I am such a fuck-up!

34:41.538 --> 34:43.540
Oi! Luke!

34:45.125 --> 34:47.627
Jon! Make him stop!

34:49.170 --> 34:51.505
What the fuck are you doing?!

35:08.356 --> 35:09.774
Police. Alright?

35:11.359 --> 35:13.027
Shit!

35:14.362 --> 35:16.280
- It's a dead end.
- No, no, no, no, no.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.491
- No, it can't end like this.
- Yes, it can.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.242
Police coming through.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.620
- Excuse me.
- Move! Get out of the way!

35:24.414 --> 35:26.374
Get out.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.251
Come on, Jon.

35:30.337 --> 35:33.298
What? What are you...?

35:34.633 --> 35:37.886
Wait. Stop. Stop.
Stop the oar. Luke. Luke!

35:43.391 --> 35:47.353
- Oh, genius.
- Luke, what are you doing?

35:47.520 --> 35:50.314
(He)', guys! Guys, here!

35:51.358 --> 35:53.318
- Open the door!
- What?

35:53.485 --> 35:54.652
Open the door more!

35:54.819 --> 35:56.695
Oh, no, no, no, no. Not the oar.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.030
- Open the door!
- Luke!

35:58.198 --> 36:02.243
No! Oh, no, no, no, no!
Not the car! Fuck! Shit!

36:10.418 --> 36:12.378
We made it!

36:14.631 --> 36:18.801
Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Bro, where's this thing headed?

36:18.968 --> 36:21.178
I don't know, man, but you've
got balls for brains, bro!

36:21.346 --> 36:23.890
- That was awesome!
- I'm a genius!

36:25.100 --> 36:27.936
You're a maniac.
Get the fuck away from me!

36:32.565 --> 36:34.441
What did you do?

37:03.596 --> 37:05.639
She's pretty upset, man.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.406
Hey. You OK?

37:23.825 --> 37:26.077
He nearly killed us, Jon.

37:27.787 --> 37:30.331
Who the hell is he
trying to impress?

37:30.498 --> 37:33.209
I mean... I could hazard a guess.

37:35.170 --> 37:38.256
You know what? I can't change
that vote stuck here.

37:38.423 --> 37:42.923
Maybe you could, um, like... Like,
blog or tweet or something?

37:46.389 --> 37:48.307
You don't get it, do you, Jon?

37:49.350 --> 37:52.019
It takes so much more than
mouse clicks to make a difference.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.354

some stupid game of hot wheels.

I gotta apologise about... Things.
See, anyway.

Apologise for what? Maybe I can
give you some womanly advice.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.002
No, it's just, um...

43:51.838 --> 43:54.382
- Suzie's awesome.
- Mm-hm.

43:54.549 --> 43:59.049
You know, like, she's awesome,
and, uh, I just... I wasn't sure.

43:59.428 --> 44:01.805
You weren't sure about what?

44:01.973 --> 44:05.643
About what I was bringing
to the table. About me.

44:05.810 --> 44:09.772
So, um, yeah.
So I just... I didn't go.

44:09.939 --> 44:11.815
You didn't go where?

44:15.778 --> 44:17.321
To our wedding.

44:21.534 --> 44:23.786

44:23.953 --> 44:26.372

I know. I get that.

Oh, whoa.

44:28.708 --> 44:31.127
Dude, that's...

44:39.760 --> 44:42.804
Oh, well, looks like
we're going to Invercargill.

44:44.473 --> 44:47.392
Come on. Look, man,
you wanna get to Suzie, right?

44:48.853 --> 44:52.106
- Yeah.
- Then cheers, 'cause we're going.

44:52.273 --> 44:53.732
Yeah.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.445
To making invercargill.

45:26.349 --> 45:28.225
I should warn you.

45:30.394 --> 45:32.354
I've got two rules.

45:36.525 --> 45:38.777
I only do it once

45:38.945 --> 45:41.948
and feelings
can't come into it, OK?

45:47.328 --> 45:48.829
I, um...

45:49.914 --> 45:53.042
can't promise no feelings.

45:54.669 --> 45:56.253
Then it's no deal.

45:57.338 --> 45:59.381
You have to protect yourself, Luke.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.968
What if I break
your precious little heart?

46:07.390 --> 46:09.850
<i>It...</i> It would have been worth <i>it...</i>

46:12.979 --> 46:14.855
to have these feelings.

46:41.048 --> 46:43.467
Oh... Fuck.

<i>I have you so close that
your hand upon my chest is mine,</i>

47:04.030 --> 47:06.574
<i>so close that your eyes
close with my dreams.</i>

47:06.741 --> 47:09.618
<i>What?</i>

47:09.785 --> 47:11.536
<i>You think...
You hate it, don't you?</i>

47:11.704 --> 47:13.288
<i>- No.
- You just want...</i>

47:36.187 --> 47:37.855
Morning.

47:38.022 --> 47:39.940
Morning.

47:56.123 --> 47:58.125
Where did you learn French?

48:01.587 --> 48:03.589
Mum was a French teacher.

48:04.715 --> 48:07.426
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:07.593 --> 48:12.055
She started tutoring me
when I was about... 2.

48:15.184 --> 48:16.810
And where's mum now?

48:23.734 --> 48:25.277
She passed.

48:26.654 --> 48:29.657
- Sorry, I didn't mean <i>to...</i>
- Oh.

48:40.626 --> 48:42.586
Speak some French to me.

49:01.147 --> 49:03.691
That sounds pretty romantic.

49:05.443 --> 49:07.903
What'd you say?

49:08.070 --> 49:09.863
I said you have...

49:10.906 --> 49:12.699
mean boobies.

49:13.742 --> 49:15.827
You little shit!

49:18.539 --> 49:22.584
Bloody typical.

49:30.050 --> 49:32.719
Oh. Um...

49:32.887 --> 49:34.471
I think we should get off.

49:35.681 --> 49:37.224
I mean, like, the three of us.

49:37.391 --> 49:38.975
I mean off the train.

49:39.143 --> 49:40.853
The three of us
should get off the train

49:41.020 --> 49:42.664
'cause we're about
to get to the stop soon.

49:42.688 --> 49:43.939
Oh, god.

49:51.071 --> 49:54.991
Hey, we're almost at the station.
Where's Keira, man?

49:55.159 --> 49:58.412

and livestock to get behind us.

49:58.579 --> 50:00.872

the length of New Zealand,

50:01.040 --> 50:03.000
all the way to invercargill.

50:04.543 --> 50:06.962
Keira! Come on!

50:15.846 --> 50:18.932
What are you guys doing?
We can't take this.

50:19.099 --> 50:21.142
- I'm not leaving it.
- Why not?

50:21.310 --> 50:22.686
Because if we leave it,

50:22.853 --> 50:24.831
then they'll definitely know
we're in the south island.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.481
Come on, Keira. We gotta go.
We gotta go.

50:26.649 --> 50:28.233
It's happening in three seconds.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.859
- One, two...
- You're a little shit.

50:30.027 --> 50:31.486
I can't believe it!

50:31.654 --> 50:33.614
Coming!

50:33.781 --> 50:35.783
OK. Let's do this.

50:35.950 --> 50:38.452
Jesus.

the guts to stand up for something?

58:58.785 --> 59:02.079
Look, Keira,
your protest is awesome,

59:02.247 --> 59:05.124

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:53.408
I took to the speedway,

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:55.451
and I felt closer to her.

01:05:57.745 --> 01:05:59.747
I won almost every race.

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:04.961
But I owed a chop shop crew
for the stock car and all the gear.

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:10.921
So I started working for them,
stripping hot cars, drug runs,

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:23.021

I mean, look at me, man.
Shit, I've...

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:45.960
I got kicked out of my flat,
I got fired by my publisher,

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:47.628
and I've been run to ground

01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:50.506

every cop in New Zealand.

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.676

their own path to take.

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:41.724
Bro, are we taking that car
to Invercargill

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:45.019
or you plan on
hitching in your undies?

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:54.153
Whatever it takes, man.
Whatever it takes.

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:06.790
Well, there's your GPS fuse.

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:09.960
That's cool.

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:14.590
Are you getting baked, bro?

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:18.385
Weed sharpens my mind.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.139
I do some of my clearest
thinking on weed.

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:25.100
And it sharpens my mind as well.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:02.134
- You look ridiculous.
- Hey, shit's getting real.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:06.015
Lay off the weed, bro.
This ain't 'call of duty'.

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:09.812
The road south's no good.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.772
Come on, pork pie.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.649
A couple of cops
never stopped you before.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:19.317
Open country, choppers,
nowhere to hide.

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:23.033
That actually does sound
like 'call of duty'.

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:27.787
Do you want me
to cause a diversion?

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:37.711
OK. Why don't you call 111
and tell them we're over there?

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:43.429
You're a genius. I'll do it.

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:48.600
Jon, I was joking, man!

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.536
Yes!

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:17.463
It's them. It's the blondini phone.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.842
Uh, put it on speaker.

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:32.603
Slow down, man.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.897
Ah! Shit!

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:17.231
Yes! Yes! That's what
I'm talking about, brother! Whoo!

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:17.625
Hey, look at those people.
Those people recognise us.

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:21.211
They're like fans
or friends or something.

01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:22.880
Baa!

01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:24.214
Whoo!

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:25.424
Baa!

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:26.592
Whoo!

01:12:27.969 --> 01:12:31.389
Freedom of sheep!
Freedom of sheep!

01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:34.475
Don't let them pull the wool
over your eyes, ladies!

01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:37.936
Don't eat your friends for dinner!

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:39.146
Baa!

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:42.190
Sir, that is a nice jumper.
Clearly a sheep lover.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:44.026
Ah, fuck off.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.403
Ah. Oh.

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:49.240
Maybe could've phrased
that last one a little bit better.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:58.707
Hey, guys!

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.127
Pull over! Hey!

01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:04.672
Wait, who...? Who is that?

01:13:06.674 --> 01:13:10.302
- Hey, guys, pull over!
- Who does he think he is?

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:13.096
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm bongo.

01:13:13.264 --> 01:13:17.142
I'm a mate, yeah? You guys
are amazing. I love you guys.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:21.810
- Nah, nah, man. I don't trust him.
- Yeah, nah. We're OK, man.

01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:24.066
- You guys are fucked!
- Hey, that's not friendly.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.233
Whoa.

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:27.027
I'm just calling it like it is, eh?

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:29.863
The cops have blocked all the roads
between here and Clyde.

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:33.492
They've got two choppers, eh,
sweeping up from the south.

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:35.535
They're after you, man.
They're after ya!

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:37.788
Where? How does he know that?

01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:39.456
- It's a...
- No, no, ask him.

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:42.960
- Oh, oh. How do you know that?
- I've got a police scanner, eh?

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:44.837
He's got a police scanner.

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:47.564
Nah, man. If he wants to follow us,
he can get a Twitter account.

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:49.716
- Sorry, man, nah, we're good.
- I'm on Twitter.

01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:52.052
- No, we're all good.
- I'm here to help!

01:13:52.219 --> 01:13:54.387
- Fucking crazy.
- You need some petrol, guys?

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:56.635
I can get you some petrol.
I can source that for you.

01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:59.393
I've got it back in my shed.
I've also got some mannequins.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.103
Petrol.

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:21.457
Slide it in, mate. Just slide it in
nice and tight. Yeah, that's it.

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:31.925
I can help you guys if you want.
Anything you need.

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:33.761
Uh, petrol's all we need.

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:43.183
I can get a... hey, I can get us
50 K's south through the farm, yeah?

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:47.233
Slip the noose.
So we... so...

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.193
Uh, there's no us, bro.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.904
How much do we owe you
for the gas?

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:57.993
I'll Chuck in the gas for free
as a joining fee.

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:03.123
There's... there's no joining.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:05.959
But you're one man down, mate.
Yeah, and I'm...

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:08.754
No, we're not a man down.
We're good.

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:11.214
It's good, bro. We're good.

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:17.179
When it comes down to it, guys,

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.348
you're gonna need
some hardware, right?

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:23.352
Um, we're a peaceful protest, mate.

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:30.192
Ooh!

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:37.324
I can shoot a man 3 K away
with this one.

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:40.035
Yeah, he wouldn't even know
what hit him.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:42.402
He could be doing anything.
He could be, I don't know...

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.831
He could be hanging out
his washing, for example.

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:48.836
Yeah? And thinking to himself,
"I've got a little bit of a bloat.

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:51.380
"Maybe I should switch
to almond milk."

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:55.551
And then I'm there, and then bang!

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:58.512
He's dead.

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:01.598
And his last thought
was almond milk.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.149
Hey, Pongo, we're just gonna
take the gas, I think...

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:13.402
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- The name is bongo!

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:16.655
Whoa, whoa, whoa, bro.
Easy. Look, look, look. It's all good.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:18.782
You... you passed. You passed.

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:22.828
Passed what?

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:25.372
This test.
This whole thing was just a test.

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:28.333
What? What kind of test?

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:30.711
- Well, um...
- What the fuck was the name? Quick.

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:32.337
- The blondini...
- Yeah, blondini.

01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:34.340
- Test.
- The blondini test.

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:38.928
We just wanted to see if you'd go
all the way, and you took it...

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:40.971
All the way, man. All the way.

01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:43.181
Yes, yes. You nailed it, man.

01:16:43.349 --> 01:16:46.602
- That was all a test?
- Yeah, it was a test.

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:48.729
You just tested me,
and I pa... And I passed?

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:50.522
- Yeah, bro.
- Yes, congratulations, man.

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:52.732
I nailed it. Oh, my god,
you guys are crack-up.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.861
'Cause I almost blew his brains out
for calling me Pongo.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:57.863
- And it was just a test?
- Yeah, I saw that.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:01.742
I saw that coming.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.997
And then I would've taken you out
too, mate, and then myself.

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:09.666
But, anyway, c'est la vie.

01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:12.419
OK, here's the plan.
I'll go and get my stuff.

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:17.086
And then... Hit the road, Jack.
Hey?

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:20.260
Blondinis!

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.430
Get the petrol can.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:28.102
You guys are gonna love these.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.272
Guys?

01:17:31.438 --> 01:17:33.148
Guys!

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:36.276
Oi! No!

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:38.611
Go! Go, man, go!

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:41.031
'Oh' my god!
Guys!

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.586
Holy shit!

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.193
- Wake up!
- Calm yourself! Calm yourself!

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.653
- We need to get home, man!
- Yes, yes, I'm doing!

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:22.656
He fucking fired
a rocket launcher,

01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:25.867
so just give me a second,
please, to...

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:29.163
Where the fuck are we?

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:39.840
Which way? Left or right?

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:43.051
Left.

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.720
Yep.

01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:48.556
Yeah, left. Left.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.767
Left, man.

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:53.353
No, no, no, left. Left.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.563
- The map's upside down.
- What?

01:18:57.524 --> 01:18:59.084
I didn't know
they did upside-down maps.

01:18:59.193 --> 01:19:01.028
Why would you even
bother with that?

01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:12.331
I've been shot.

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.129
- Do you know who did this?
- Yes.

01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:21.399
- Do you know who shot you?
- Yeah, the blondini gang.

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.133
- The blondinis?
- Yes, they're driving...

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.302
Yes, they're driving around
in an apricot mini,

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:27.387
and they're shooting
whoever they see.

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:29.305
- OK.
- I was the only...

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:32.017
I was the only one
smart enough to survive.

01:19:32.184 --> 01:19:33.602
Go, go, go!

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:35.145
Assembly port B.

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:36.813
Quick smart, guys.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:44.988
What's going on?
It's armed response.

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:47.365
What do you mean armed?

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:50.452
Guns. Armed usually means guns.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:54.206
- Ha!
- Got your speech ready?

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:55.916
- My what ready?
- Your speech.

01:19:58.043 --> 01:19:59.961
About what you're
gonna say to Suzie.

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:01.588
No. You got any ideas?

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:03.400
- No, I don't have any ideas.
- You brought it up.

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:05.402
- You must have some ideas.
- I'm not in your situation.

01:20:05.426 --> 01:20:07.988
- I haven't been in your situation.
- OK, alright! I think I'm gonna...

01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:09.805
Yes, I've got some things to say.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.390
- Well, hit me.
- I didn't...

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:14.142
I'm... I'll just...
I'll go with the moment.

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:22.943
Detective, what's going on?

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:26.154
Wait, this isn't about
the boys, right? But...

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.906
- Come on.
- Is it?

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:34.871
Come on, hurry up!

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:39.125
- Oh!
- Shit. Sorry!

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.712
Oh.

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:16.830
I'm gonna try that phone box.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.666
OK, I'll get us a feed.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:45.942
Shit.

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:54.867
Hello?

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:00.331
- Mum, have you seen my phone?
- No, darling.

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:02.125
Oh, it's so weird.

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:04.932
I thought I left it in here charging,
but I can't find it anywhere.

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:07.381
- Aw.
- I need to book my taxi.

01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:15.806
Did you know
your land line's unplugged?

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:19.976
Oh, yes, <i>I</i> did it.

bothering me all week.

Hello. Davidson residence.

I need a fresh start, Jon.

01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:05.006

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:31.657

01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:45.880
