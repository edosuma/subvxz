00:07.000 --> 00:10.959
(magical romantic music)

00:16.140 --> 00:21.089
I'm wishing on a star

00:23.020 --> 00:27.969
To follow where you are

00:29.860 --> 00:34.650
I'm wishing on a dream

00:36.450 --> 00:41.399
To follow what it means

00:43.620 --> 00:47.989
And I wish on all the rainbows

00:48.040 --> 00:50.668
That I've seen

00:50.710 --> 00:55.670
I wish on all the
people who really dream

01:07.730 --> 01:11.973
I'm wishing on a star

01:14.240 --> 01:19.189
To follow where you are

01:30.590 --> 01:35.289
- [Voiceover] I am dead
but my work is unfinished.

01:37.050 --> 01:40.599
The house of Snow
White survives.

01:45.310 --> 01:50.009
In the ruin of my castle,
you will find the source

01:50.060 --> 01:52.142
of my power.

01:52.190 --> 01:56.069
(dramatic music)

02:31.270 --> 02:33.602
These are my gifts.

02:33.650 --> 02:36.437
They give you my power.

02:37.530 --> 02:40.021
Mirrors to travel.

02:42.660 --> 02:45.072
Mirrors to spy.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.129
Mirrors to remember.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.548
Mirrors to forget.

02:56.010 --> 02:59.548
Mirrors to rule the world!

03:00.050 --> 03:04.134
(majestic music)

03:07.270 --> 03:10.979
- So good to have
the power back.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.029
(fire crackling)

03:21.700 --> 03:25.079
- Frying tonight,
fryIng tonight!

03:25.120 --> 03:26.985
- Keep away from me!

03:27.040 --> 03:28.280
- Frying tonight!

03:28.330 --> 03:29.991
- I mean it!

03:35.090 --> 03:37.206
- Listen to this, a present for

03:37.250 --> 03:40.048
the strongest, bravest troll.

03:40.590 --> 03:42.000
(laughing)

03:42.050 --> 03:44.962
Oh, you know what
it smells like?

03:45.890 --> 03:49.018
(inhaling)

03:50.020 --> 03:52.090
- (together) Leather!

03:52.140 --> 03:52.890
(laughing)

03:52.940 --> 03:54.259
- Shoes!

03:54.310 --> 03:56.312
- Well it could be books.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.318
- And my size by
the look of things.

04:03.110 --> 04:06.113
(ﬁghﬁng)

04:06.160 --> 04:08.151
- They're mine, it's a present
for me and you know it,

04:08.200 --> 04:08.825
- No they're mine!

04:08.870 --> 04:09.905
- Mine!

04:13.080 --> 04:16.914
- Let's spin a coin to
decide who gets them.

04:22.090 --> 04:24.718
(Punch)

04:32.180 --> 04:34.228
- Well, hello!

04:36.400 --> 04:39.016
Rescue is at hand!

04:39.070 --> 04:40.139
- Don't come any nearer!

04:40.190 --> 04:41.896
- Don't worry, I'm
not who I used to be.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.771
I've had extensive therapy.

04:43.820 --> 04:46.812
I realized I have been using
food as a substitute for love

04:46.870 --> 04:48.770
and I have the
books to prove it.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.401
Breaking the Cycle.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.663
Heal Yourself in Seven Days.

04:55.710 --> 04:58.452
Stop Blaming Yourself, Please.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.706
And Help for the
Bedwetting Child,

04:59.750 --> 05:00.739
which I picked up by mistake

05:00.800 --> 05:01.915
but I've got them all!

05:02.880 --> 05:03.915
- You come an inch closer and

05:03.970 --> 05:05.870
I swear I'll shout my head off.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.546
- 000, that is what's
known as an empty threat.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.216
(inhaling)

05:11.810 --> 05:14.131
(howling)

05:15.600 --> 05:17.181
I hope you don't
mind me saying this,

05:17.230 --> 05:19.972
but I get the feeling you still
don't completely trust me.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.317
- I don't trust you at all!

05:21.360 --> 05:23.646
You tried to eat my grandmother!

05:23.940 --> 05:26.067
- Oh, no!

05:29.030 --> 05:31.237
I was just being playful.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.327
See wolfies just pretend
to do naughty things.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.450
I would have never
really eaten her,

05:37.500 --> 05:39.661
she was tough old bird.

05:39.710 --> 05:41.496
I wouldn't hurt a sausage.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.950
Butter would not
melt In my mouth.

05:44.670 --> 05:46.126
Well, it would melt, of
course it would melt,

05:46.180 --> 05:48.136
but very slowly.

05:48.180 --> 05:49.920
Argh! Puff!

05:51.010 --> 05:53.513
I give you my solemn wolf word,

05:53.560 --> 05:55.016
you are safe with me.

05:55.060 --> 05:57.016
You are as safe as a,

05:57.060 --> 05:59.051
brick-built pig house!

05:59.100 --> 06:01.261
Now, wait here a moment
while I plan our escape

06:01.320 --> 06:04.062
we are in romantically,
reckless danger.

06:06.740 --> 06:08.810
How are you at climbing?

06:08.860 --> 06:11.021
I nearly fell off
three times coming up.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.196
- Those incredible shoes.

06:14.620 --> 06:16.576
They made them invisible.

06:16.620 --> 06:17.746
- Yeah, I know.

06:17.790 --> 06:19.371
- Yeah, but they
made them invisible.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.990
(magical music)

06:21.040 --> 06:22.371
- Well don't touch
them, they'll make you

06:22.420 --> 06:24.547
want to wear them all the time.

06:24.590 --> 06:27.127
Balcony, or corridor?

06:27.170 --> 06:29.081
That is the question.

06:29.470 --> 06:30.585
- I'm not going to touch them,

06:30.640 --> 06:32.426
I just want to
see how they work.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.306
- They're working
on you even now.

06:36.350 --> 06:38.227
Just leave them well alone.

06:38.270 --> 06:41.182
(magical music)

06:41.230 --> 06:42.970
Corridor I think.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.982
No!

06:47.030 --> 06:49.487
Balcony, quick,
there's someone coming!

06:49.530 --> 06:52.408
(dramatic music)

07:15.470 --> 07:17.552
Excuse me, excuse me,

07:17.600 --> 07:18.885
where do you think
you're going exactly?

07:18.930 --> 07:19.726
- Back to prison.

07:19.770 --> 07:20.930
- Back to prison?

07:20.980 --> 07:21.890
See that wouldn't
be my first choice.

07:21.940 --> 07:23.055
- No, I'm going to
find my father and then

07:23.110 --> 07:24.145
I'm going to go right back home.

07:24.190 --> 07:26.010
- Alright, alright, alright!

07:26.070 --> 07:27.310
But not this way.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.987
Virginia, please listen.

07:29.030 --> 07:29.940
You won't survive five minutes

07:29.990 --> 07:32.197
unless you follow me.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.827
Now we must avoid this road.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.117
Go this way.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.162
(thunder claps)

07:41.210 --> 07:43.417
(dramatic music)

07:43.460 --> 07:44.950
- No way am I going in there.

07:46.420 --> 07:49.412
(thunder claps)

07:49.970 --> 07:53.212
(maniacal laughter)

08:09.440 --> 08:13.149
(thunder claps)

08:22.790 --> 08:24.451
Brave Jack.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.990
Jack?

08:26.040 --> 08:28.668
- Jack and the beanstalk,
the first mayor of Beantown.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.121
You know this, this used to
be a very prosperous area

08:32.170 --> 08:34.126
before all the beanstalks
sprouted everywhere

08:34.180 --> 08:36.045
and polluted the land.

08:36.090 --> 08:38.502
The trolls were given
it as their kingdom,

08:38.560 --> 08:39.959
that's why they hate
Prince Wendell so much

08:40.020 --> 08:42.636
because he has a
juicy, fertile kingdom

08:42.680 --> 08:45.843
and they have a polluted
disgusting kingdom.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.640
(suspenseful music)

08:47.690 --> 08:48.315
Virginia?

08:48.360 --> 08:50.316
(thunder claps)

08:50.360 --> 08:52.237
Virginia?

08:52.860 --> 08:54.771
Virginia?

08:55.070 --> 08:57.868
Virginia, Virginia,
Virginia, please tell me

08:57.910 --> 09:00.401
you didn't take the
troll king's magic shoes.

09:01.790 --> 09:03.155
Virginia?

09:03.210 --> 09:04.529
Virginia?

09:05.040 --> 09:05.995
Virginia?

09:06.750 --> 09:08.126
- Idiots!

09:09.550 --> 09:11.120
Fools!

09:11.170 --> 09:13.547
I can't leave you
alone for a minute.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.672
Your mothers would
be ashamed of you.

09:16.090 --> 09:17.887
- No, no no, dad it
wasn't our fault.

09:17.930 --> 09:21.889
The witch, she tricked us
with this magic shoebox.

09:25.850 --> 09:28.227
- Best wishes from wolf.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.936
- Virginia?

09:32.230 --> 09:34.061
I know you think you're
safe in those shoes,

09:34.110 --> 09:37.102
but nothing could be
further from the truth.

09:37.160 --> 09:41.028
Anything a troll has is bound
to be bad and dangerous.

09:41.410 --> 09:42.900
Virginia.

09:43.910 --> 09:46.708
Where are you?

09:49.380 --> 09:53.202
(growling)

10:05.310 --> 10:08.188
(sparks)

10:12.860 --> 10:15.146
- Oh no.

10:15.190 --> 10:16.942
- Hello again!

10:18.070 --> 10:19.981
They're not fully
recharged, you see?

10:20.030 --> 10:21.361
They don't stay
invisible very long

10:21.410 --> 10:22.525
without a proper break

10:22.580 --> 10:23.865
it's a design
fault in the shoes,

10:23.910 --> 10:26.071
one of many in fact (laughing).

10:27.620 --> 10:29.110
(punch)

10:29.170 --> 10:30.956
(moaning)

10:32.130 --> 10:33.040
- You're not having them!

10:33.090 --> 10:34.125
- Having what?

10:34.170 --> 10:35.455
- The shoes.

10:35.510 --> 10:36.829
They're mine.

10:36.880 --> 10:37.414
- Oh,

10:37.470 --> 10:38.869
(struggle)

10:38.930 --> 10:39.885
If you don't get rid of them now

10:39.930 --> 10:42.091
you won't be able to later.

10:43.350 --> 10:47.673
- Ah, you're right,
oh you're right.

10:48.020 --> 10:51.854
Oh I don't want them, they
made me feel so strange.

10:52.310 --> 10:55.939
God, it felt so
powerful, you know,

10:55.980 --> 10:58.062
being invisible.

10:58.110 --> 11:00.351
Just amazing!

11:00.410 --> 11:02.981
Fantastic!

11:03.030 --> 11:05.612
How did you know where I was?

11:05.660 --> 11:08.709
- I could smell you.

11:11.830 --> 11:13.377
Follow me!

11:14.340 --> 11:16.296
(growling)

11:16.340 --> 11:18.001
There's about 70 beanstalks left

11:18.050 --> 11:20.086
but not many are
occupied these days.

11:20.130 --> 11:22.837
Giants drink so much
they rarely have time

11:22.890 --> 11:24.380
to reproduce.

11:24.430 --> 11:25.749
- Can I ask you a question?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.766
- Yeah, of course.

11:27.810 --> 11:30.938
- Do you think I'm sexy?

11:38.440 --> 11:40.021
I should be scared of.

11:40.070 --> 11:41.901
- Oh Virginia.

11:41.950 --> 11:43.315
As much as I would
love to believe what

11:43.370 --> 11:44.610
you're saying to me right now,

11:44.660 --> 11:46.025
I'm afraid it's the
shoes that are talking.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.945
You'd say anything
to put them on again.

11:47.990 --> 11:49.116
- Give them back.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.287
Come on, give em back.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.993
Oh, oh, I'm really sorry.

11:57.460 --> 12:00.042
That was weird, I don't
know what came over me.

12:00.090 --> 12:02.172
- Oh, they bring out very
strange things, these shoes.

12:02.220 --> 12:03.084
- Yeah

12:03.140 --> 12:05.290
- Whatever you're suppressing.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.057
- I'm not suppressing anything.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.977
(thunder claps)

12:10.020 --> 12:10.975
What?

12:11.020 --> 12:12.305
- Trolls.

12:12.350 --> 12:13.556
They found us.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.148
Oh, cripes, we're in
big big trouble now.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.936
They have dogs, they're
going to sniff us out.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.982
Run, run!

12:22.070 --> 12:23.776
(dogs barking)

12:23.820 --> 12:26.368
(trolls yelling)

12:26.410 --> 12:29.482
(thunder claps)

12:30.160 --> 12:31.866
- This way!

12:31.910 --> 12:34.037
The dogs are on the scent.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.911
They're very close now.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.872
They can smell 'em!

12:39.340 --> 12:41.626
Don't let them escape again!

12:51.100 --> 12:53.056
- Blue Bell, come here.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.552
Flatfoot, got any
magic mushrooms?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.898
- No, but I've got
some dwarf moss

13:00.940 --> 13:03.488
and it'll really blow
your head off though.

13:03.780 --> 13:06.101
Look at this, the
last time I took it

13:06.160 --> 13:08.617
I saw fairies for three days.

13:08.660 --> 13:09.945
(laughing)

13:09.990 --> 13:12.038
- Nicey nice!

13:12.080 --> 13:13.866
Roll us a giant.

13:13.910 --> 13:14.865
- You got it.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.071
- This may be a long night.

13:23.220 --> 13:27.008
(growling)

13:28.720 --> 13:31.382
- Blue Bell, Burly, Blaberwort?

13:31.430 --> 13:32.886
Where are you?

13:32.930 --> 13:34.761
- Coming, Dad.

13:36.060 --> 13:40.178
(thunder claps)

13:41.780 --> 13:43.179
- The beanstalk
has a potent smell,

13:43.240 --> 13:44.480
it puts off the dogs.

13:44.530 --> 13:46.270
- You don't have to tell me.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.982
- We'll stay up here for a
little while till it's safe.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.958
- So how did you get
involved in all this anyway?

13:58.000 --> 14:01.379
- Ah, I found myself
at a loose end,

14:01.420 --> 14:02.796
and you know..

14:02.840 --> 14:04.205
- _You were in that
prison weren't you?

14:04.260 --> 14:06.922
What were you in for?

14:06.970 --> 14:07.959
- Well nothing much,
just a little bit

14:08.010 --> 14:10.251
of sheep worrying that's all.

14:10.300 --> 14:14.509
Putting a wolf into a prison
cell with nowhere to bound

14:14.560 --> 14:16.130
only able to stare at
the slq through bars,

14:16.180 --> 14:18.899
now that's inhuman.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.140
- Do you think maybe
I should, you know

14:24.190 --> 14:25.737
put them on again?

14:25.780 --> 14:26.986
- What?

14:27.030 --> 14:27.849
- No, I mean, the
shoes are probably

14:27.900 --> 14:29.197
fully recharged and. I can...
- No!

14:29.240 --> 14:31.617
- No!

14:32.080 --> 14:34.822
- What is that?

14:35.910 --> 14:37.901
- It's just my tail.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.917
- Your tail?

14:40.960 --> 14:42.666
What?

14:42.710 --> 14:45.087
- Well it's not very big
at this time of month.

14:45.130 --> 14:47.462
It's just a little brush.

14:47.510 --> 14:49.171
- You've got a tail?

14:49.220 --> 14:51.040
- Yeah, so?

14:51.090 --> 14:52.887
You have succulent breasts,

14:52.930 --> 14:55.967
I don't go on about
them all the time, do I?

14:58.640 --> 15:01.222
Why don't you touch it?

15:01.270 --> 15:04.182
It's perfectly normal.

15:04.230 --> 15:07.814
- If it's normal how come you
keep it hidden all the time?

15:07.860 --> 15:08.895
- Because if you
haven't noticed,

15:08.950 --> 15:11.191
people don't like wolfs.

15:12.950 --> 15:15.657
Come on, give it a stroke.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.669
It won't bite.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.049
' (gasp)

15:26.090 --> 15:27.910
- What? What?

15:27.960 --> 15:30.542
- With the fur, not against it!

15:30.590 --> 15:33.252
(laughing)

15:40.980 --> 15:43.608
- I've got keys going missing.

15:43.650 --> 15:47.279
I've got trolls and
wolves and queens missing.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.146
What in the fairy-ing
forest has happened

15:50.200 --> 15:52.851
to basic security
in this prison?

15:52.910 --> 15:54.309
- Sir?

15:54.370 --> 15:55.860
While we were searching
the prison we found

15:55.910 --> 15:57.866
that the door to the
cellars was unlocked at

15:57.910 --> 16:00.572
the time of the
queen's break-out.

16:00.620 --> 16:03.111
- [Prince] Cellar? Did
he just say cellar?

16:03.170 --> 16:06.037
- It is possible she
escaped that way.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.546
- What's down there?

16:07.590 --> 16:09.251
You.

16:09.670 --> 16:11.331
- It's just some old junk, sir.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.177
It's been there for
hundreds of years,

16:13.220 --> 16:15.176
before this place was a prison.

16:15.220 --> 16:16.596
- [Prince] The mirror!

16:16.640 --> 16:18.130
- Take the work detail
off the laundry room,

16:18.180 --> 16:20.228
have them clear out the
whole place, top to bottom.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.261
Now, get out.

16:25.400 --> 16:29.393
(dramatic music)

16:29.440 --> 16:32.944
- [Prince] Oh no, that's the
mirror to the other world.

16:32.990 --> 16:35.367
I'd better put Anthony's
name on the work detail.

16:42.210 --> 16:45.282
To-ny

16:46.960 --> 16:50.202
Lew-is.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.769
- Alright now, pay attention.

17:01.100 --> 17:03.887
Everything here has
to be cleared out.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.807
So form a human chain,
and chuck everything into

17:06.860 --> 17:09.226
that boat moored there.

17:13.740 --> 17:15.947
- Ah, excuse me?

17:16.280 --> 17:17.941
- What?

17:17.990 --> 17:19.946
- Well, we're kind of
far away from the boat,

17:19.990 --> 17:21.992
aren't we in danger
of some of the more

17:22.040 --> 17:24.247
delicate objects being broken?

17:24.290 --> 17:25.416
- What do you think
this is Lewis?

17:25.460 --> 17:27.530
An elves underwear party?

17:27.580 --> 17:30.492
Look, this is scrap,
now do as you're told!

17:30.550 --> 17:31.039
- I'm...

17:31.090 --> 17:33.331
- And shut it!

17:43.520 --> 17:45.431
(shattering)

17:46.520 --> 17:49.353
- Huffety puffety, there it is!

17:50.980 --> 17:53.687
- Oh God, I hope
he's okay in there.

17:56.070 --> 17:58.561
He can take care
of himself, right?

17:58.620 --> 18:01.908
I mean he can stay out of
trouble for one day at least.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.781
Can't he?

18:03.830 --> 18:06.617
- Well, from what I
know about your father,

18:06.660 --> 18:08.628
I very much doubt it.

18:10.500 --> 18:14.664
(shattering)

18:28.940 --> 18:31.431
- (whispering) Mirror, on.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.890
Mirror, on on, mirror, mirror.

18:32.940 --> 18:34.521
- Lewis?

18:34.570 --> 18:37.892
What in the fairy-ing forest
do you think you're doing?

18:38.820 --> 18:41.732
- It's not working.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.900
- Listen Lewis, you
little prison princess.

18:43.950 --> 18:47.329
Throw that mirror
on that boat, now!

18:47.580 --> 18:48.911
- Uh,

18:48.960 --> 18:51.872
no I can't, I'm
afraid it'll break.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.582
- As you've refused to
obey my instructions,

18:54.630 --> 18:57.508
I am going to push
you into the river.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.882
And as you are
connected by leg irons

19:00.930 --> 19:05.879
to each of your comrades,
they will also, sadly, drown.

19:10.980 --> 19:13.813
- Alright, alright, alright.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.578
(smashing)

19:37.670 --> 19:39.501
- OK, you wait here.

19:39.550 --> 19:40.926
I'll put the magic
shoes on and I'll

19:40.970 --> 19:42.210
go back inside the prison.

19:42.260 --> 19:43.500
- No way, you'll
never come back,

19:43.550 --> 19:44.630
you just want them for yourself!

19:44.680 --> 19:45.339
- No, no I don't.

19:45.390 --> 19:46.550
- You do!

19:46.600 --> 19:49.808
- Yes, I do, but,
oh, I'm fighting it!

19:49.850 --> 19:51.932
Unlike you!

19:51.980 --> 19:54.767
(growling)

19:54.810 --> 19:55.310
I have an idea.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.566
- What?

19:56.610 --> 19:57.520
- I'll wear them,
you hold onto me,

19:57.570 --> 19:58.730
because if you're touching me,

19:58.780 --> 20:00.065
we'll both be invisible.

20:00.110 --> 20:02.158
- No!

20:02.200 --> 20:04.407
I will wear them.

20:04.450 --> 20:06.987
And you can hold onto me.

20:08.620 --> 20:11.407
- You are hopelessly
addicted to those shoes.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.076
And I'm not too far behind.

20:14.790 --> 20:18.499
(magical music)

20:22.880 --> 20:25.713
(door squeaking)

20:27.100 --> 20:29.557
- Curses!

20:30.640 --> 20:32.938
- Now we'll have to kill him.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.720
- A tunnel!

20:35.770 --> 20:37.681
- Shh!

20:38.150 --> 20:40.892
- We've been digging
for 31 years.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.737
- Oh, but please take
me with you, please?

20:42.780 --> 20:44.350
Listen I swear,
you can trust me.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.150
You know what, at home,

20:46.200 --> 20:48.270
I've got Escape from
Alcatraz on video.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.537
I know how to do this!

20:50.580 --> 20:52.400
- Best we suffocate him I think.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.860
- No.

20:56.540 --> 20:59.543
I trust him.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.427
- Uh, thanks.

21:13.730 --> 21:18.679
I would give you my watch,
but it already went somewhere.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.891
- [Virginia] Ten months,
just for being cheeky,

21:24.950 --> 21:26.315
what are they going
to do with dad?

21:26.360 --> 21:27.941
- [Wolf] They've probably
put your father in E block,

21:27.990 --> 21:30.072
that's where new
prisoners usually go,

21:30.120 --> 21:31.189
let's go there.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.867
- [Virginia] Puppy slaying?

21:32.910 --> 21:34.491
What about Prince?

21:34.540 --> 21:35.825
(dog barking)

21:35.870 --> 21:39.089
Listen? Listen that must
be him, that's Prince.

21:39.380 --> 21:41.951
(dog barking)

21:47.890 --> 21:48.959
- [Wolf] No, Virginia,
what are you doing?

21:49.010 --> 21:50.887
No, we can't take him with us.

21:50.930 --> 21:52.466
He'll drain all the
power In the shoes

21:52.520 --> 21:54.090
and we'll become visible.

21:54.140 --> 21:55.596
Virginia!

21:55.640 --> 21:58.438
Oh, I hate dogs.

22:10.990 --> 22:15.154
- Hey, hey hey
guys, wait up, huh?

22:15.200 --> 22:18.613
- Sorry, Tony. It's
every man for himself.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.878
- Oh never mind, just
go right ahead, go, go.

22:24.050 --> 22:27.463
- [Virginia] I think he's
leading us to dad's cell.

22:32.010 --> 22:34.922
- [Wolf] This is it!

22:36.480 --> 22:39.893
- [Virginia] Dad,
Dad are you in here?

22:41.310 --> 22:44.894
(magical sparks)

22:48.030 --> 22:51.022
- No!

22:51.070 --> 22:54.699
Oh, they're exhausted.

22:56.950 --> 22:58.918
I told you this was
going to happen.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.780
(dog barking)

23:00.830 --> 23:03.037
- Look!

23:06.880 --> 23:10.793
- Boy, your father sure
works fast, I give him that.

23:11.550 --> 23:15.884
(suspenseful music)

23:28.360 --> 23:30.851
- Yes!

23:36.660 --> 23:38.400
Sure you don't want
to come with me?

23:38.450 --> 23:41.499
- A goblin travels
fastest alone.

23:42.920 --> 23:46.799
(dramatic music)

23:48.130 --> 23:51.543
(splash)

24:10.820 --> 24:13.277
- Yes! Haha.

24:24.080 --> 24:27.709
- There's something
blocking the tunnel.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.756
Tony is that you?

24:30.800 --> 24:32.085
- Who's that?

24:32.130 --> 24:34.542
It's me, Wolf, I gave you
the magic dragon dung beetle,

24:34.590 --> 24:35.796
remember me?

24:35.850 --> 24:37.499
- You know what, just
stay away from me?

24:37.560 --> 24:39.676
- We're in a tunnel
together, how can I do that?

24:39.720 --> 24:42.848
- I'm almost out
too, but I'm stuck.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.226
Look, just give me a push!

24:45.270 --> 24:46.726
- OK,

24:46.770 --> 24:49.273
(grunting)

24:59.660 --> 25:00.649
- Oh Dad.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.530
- Are you alright?

25:01.580 --> 25:02.865
- Yeah, ow.

25:02.910 --> 25:04.070
We have to find a way to get
back in and get the mirror.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.781
- What? No, no we don't.

25:05.830 --> 25:07.707
I threw it on a trash barge,

25:07.750 --> 25:09.047
I think on this
river right here.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.546
- Come on,

25:10.590 --> 25:11.955
Which one? Which one?

25:12.010 --> 25:13.796
- No, it was right there.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.829
- Where?

25:14.880 --> 25:15.960
- They moved it, I bet
you it's over here.

25:16.010 --> 25:16.965
- Where?

25:17.010 --> 25:18.637
- It was right here
- Where?

25:18.680 --> 25:20.136
- Oh, look they took it.

25:20.180 --> 25:21.465
Acorn's stolen it.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.683
- Oh no, he's got our mirror!

25:48.960 --> 25:51.793
- Mirror, wake from your sleep.

25:52.090 --> 25:55.378
(glass breaking)

25:55.800 --> 26:00.214
(dramatic music)

26:01.260 --> 26:03.979
Summon Relish, the Troll King.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.596
- Tony, get this thing moving.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.720
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.521
- Look, there they are.

26:12.570 --> 26:13.935
Don't let them get away!

26:13.990 --> 26:14.934
- Oh, cripes!

26:14.990 --> 26:16.696
(yelling)

26:16.740 --> 26:18.901
- Oh! Dad!

26:21.080 --> 26:22.195
- Oh my, get down, look out!

26:22.240 --> 26:24.322
(yelling)

26:24.370 --> 26:25.189
(splashing)

26:25.250 --> 26:26.535
- Get 'em, get 'em, hit 'em!

26:26.580 --> 26:28.320
Hit them with something!

26:28.370 --> 26:29.871
(yelling)

26:29.920 --> 26:31.035
- Argh, you're done!

26:31.090 --> 26:34.002
- In your dream troll boy!

26:34.050 --> 26:36.006
(beating)

26:36.050 --> 26:39.793
(yelling)

26:48.770 --> 26:51.762
- What a pathetic display.

26:52.900 --> 26:56.438
How dare you call
yourselves my children.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.139
You are the most...

26:58.200 --> 27:01.738
(growling)

27:01.780 --> 27:05.079
(yelling)

27:05.790 --> 27:07.075
- Are you alright, Dad?

27:07.120 --> 27:08.360
(moaning)

27:08.410 --> 27:10.628
- What's wrong?

27:13.340 --> 27:17.083
- Mirror. Find me a mirror.

27:18.760 --> 27:21.923
- Out! Get out!

27:24.010 --> 27:25.887
(glass breaking)

27:25.930 --> 27:27.886
- So good of you to join me.

27:27.930 --> 27:30.842
- You do that again to
me and I'll kill ya!

27:31.650 --> 27:33.015
- Well?

27:33.060 --> 27:34.971
- Well what?

27:35.020 --> 27:37.989
- Have your children
caught the dog for me?

27:39.110 --> 27:40.816
- Not exactly.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.317
- You do surprise
me, your majesty.

27:43.700 --> 27:47.784
How could he possibly escape
your tiny little grasp?

27:48.290 --> 27:50.326
- Don't you talk to me that way!

27:50.370 --> 27:52.031
- He must be caught.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.457
Send your children after him.

27:54.500 --> 27:57.799
And what are you still
doing in Wendell's kingdom?

27:57.840 --> 28:00.126
Return to your
palace immediately.

28:00.170 --> 28:02.081
Await my further orders.

28:02.130 --> 28:04.849
- I don't take orders from you!

28:05.550 --> 28:08.769
(flute music)

28:23.530 --> 28:26.693
(hawk calling)

28:33.080 --> 28:36.129
(suspenseful music)

28:47.300 --> 28:48.927
- Virginia?

28:48.970 --> 28:50.210
Would you say that
you were hungry

28:50.270 --> 28:52.727
for love and approval but,
destined for rejection?

28:52.770 --> 28:55.807
- I'm quite happy
as I am thank you.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.646
- Really?

28:57.980 --> 29:00.813
- What no, no, no!

29:03.110 --> 29:05.522
What did you do that for?!

29:05.570 --> 29:07.401
- I had to for your own good.

29:07.450 --> 29:09.441
- You threw away my shoes!

29:09.490 --> 29:10.570
- You were already
dreaming of wearing them

29:10.620 --> 29:11.746
tonight, weren't you?

29:11.790 --> 29:13.826
- Yes! I...

29:13.870 --> 29:15.497
How did you know that?

29:15.540 --> 29:16.700
- Magic is very nice,

29:16.750 --> 29:20.083
but it's very easy
to get addicted.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.257
- But why didn't you want them?

29:25.550 --> 29:28.929
How come you were able to
resist the shoes and I wasn't?

29:31.100 --> 29:34.888
- Because you have such a
strong desire to be invisible.

29:37.860 --> 29:42.604
(sad music)

29:47.410 --> 29:49.822
- [Prince] Anthony, I know
that as my new manservant

29:49.870 --> 29:51.235
you will never let me down,

29:51.290 --> 29:53.656
and will willingly give
your life to save mine,

29:53.700 --> 29:55.827
but I wonder if you'd
like to swear a formal

29:55.870 --> 29:58.703
oath of allegiance.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.128
Destiny has brought us
together, that much is clear.

30:03.630 --> 30:06.258
My destiny is to rule the
Fourth Kingdom, of course,

30:06.300 --> 30:09.007
but what is yours?

30:09.300 --> 30:12.303
Someone as lowly as
inconsequential as yourself,

30:12.350 --> 30:14.887
may yet have an
important part to pay,

30:14.930 --> 30:17.842
even if it is catering
to my every whim whilst

30:17.900 --> 30:20.357
I'm trapped in
the body of a dog.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.106
What was that?

30:22.150 --> 30:24.106
- Nothing.

30:24.150 --> 30:26.311
Fish, I don't know.

30:29.660 --> 30:34.199
(crowd jeering)

30:39.250 --> 30:41.912
- I insist you leave.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.292
Trolls are not allowed
in the Fourth Kingdom

30:44.340 --> 30:46.251
without proper permits.

30:46.300 --> 30:50.384
This is a gross violation
of the Nine Kingdoms treaty.

30:50.430 --> 30:52.921
- Shut your mouth.

30:53.640 --> 30:56.598
- Unless you leave this
instant, I shall notify

30:56.640 --> 31:00.269
Prince Wendell, and
soldiers will be sent.

31:04.820 --> 31:09.769
(crowd yelling)

31:13.660 --> 31:17.244
- I am declaring war
on the Fourth Kingdom,

31:17.870 --> 31:19.701
and I challenge Price
Wendell to come and

31:19.750 --> 31:22.878
face me within seven days.

31:22.920 --> 31:26.879
Or I will claim his
kingdom as my own.

31:26.920 --> 31:31.175
(crowd yelling)

31:35.680 --> 31:37.636
- [Wolf] Rise and shine!

31:37.680 --> 31:40.433
Wakey Wakey (howling)

31:40.480 --> 31:43.768
it's another beautiful
day in the Fourth Kingdom.

31:44.610 --> 31:45.895
Sleep well, Virginia?

31:45.940 --> 31:48.488
- Actually, no, I just
got to sleep an hour ago.

31:48.530 --> 31:50.646
- Oh, you should have
joined me on deck,

31:50.700 --> 31:54.192
sleeping under the stars,
it was quite magnificent.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.367
You look outstandingly
gorgeous in the morning,

31:57.410 --> 31:59.116
pert from the front,

31:59.160 --> 32:00.991
and a vision from behind!

32:01.040 --> 32:02.780
- Hey, hey, hey!

32:02.830 --> 32:03.819
- What?

32:03.880 --> 32:05.871
- Just don't look at
my daughter like that.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.239
- Is it this look, Tony?

32:07.300 --> 32:09.416
(panﬁng)

32:09.920 --> 32:12.218
000, I can't help it.

32:12.260 --> 32:14.216
It's animal passion.

32:14.850 --> 32:15.748
- Oh, just,

32:15.800 --> 32:16.846
look, just stay away
from her, alright,

32:16.890 --> 32:18.846
you've got a criminal record.

32:18.890 --> 32:20.096
- Well how can I
stay away from her?

32:20.140 --> 32:22.188
We're on a very small boat.

32:22.230 --> 32:25.017
I may bump into her accidentally
at any given moment.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.470
- Hey!

32:26.520 --> 32:29.068
Will you stop talking about
me as if I'm not here?

32:32.070 --> 32:33.901
- [Prince] Manservant?

32:33.950 --> 32:35.486
I need to go up on deck.

32:35.530 --> 32:38.328
Bring a bucket, and a shovel.

32:38.870 --> 32:40.952
- First of all I'm
not your manservant.

32:41.000 --> 32:41.785
And if you think I'm going to...

32:41.830 --> 32:42.819
(bumps head)

32:43.500 --> 32:44.990
Ow, what the?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.956
- Cripes!

32:48.630 --> 32:50.200
- What is that?

32:50.260 --> 32:51.158
VVhoa!

32:51.220 --> 32:52.460
- Huffety puffety.

32:52.510 --> 32:54.887
- That's one hell of a fish.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.132
Golden River gold fish.

32:58.180 --> 32:59.761
You think it's magic?

32:59.810 --> 33:01.266
- Oh, goodness gracious, yes.

33:01.310 --> 33:02.800
This is the famous,
anything you touch

33:02.850 --> 33:05.148
will turn to gold fish.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.429
- What's this,

33:08.480 --> 33:10.892
warning, do not break
glass except in case

33:10.940 --> 33:14.353
of financial emergency.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.696
- Uh, look at that
sign, look at that.

33:16.740 --> 33:18.025
Stick a finger in my mouth

33:18.080 --> 33:19.786
turn around till you face south

33:19.830 --> 33:21.286
touch a thing that
you would prize

33:21.330 --> 33:23.867
and you will not
believe your eyes.

33:23.910 --> 33:25.787
Here is magic to behold

33:25.830 --> 33:27.991
all that glitters can be gold.

33:29.210 --> 33:30.495
Do you really think
it turns whatever

33:30.550 --> 33:31.869
you touch into gold?

33:31.920 --> 33:33.547
- Well, I'm sure it does, but,

33:33.590 --> 33:35.376
we don't need to turn
anything to gold, do we?

33:35.430 --> 33:36.795
- Well, no, I mean, no,

33:36.840 --> 33:38.501
but gold is gold, right?

33:38.550 --> 33:39.710
I mean think of the guy
who owned this boat,

33:39.760 --> 33:41.216
he was no fool, he's
probably now living in the

33:41.270 --> 33:43.886
lap of luxury in some
Nine Kingdoms condominium

33:43.930 --> 33:46.478
with a mountain of
gold in his back yard

33:46.520 --> 33:48.181
and everything
his heart desires.

33:48.230 --> 33:49.857
- Best leave it alone, Tony.

33:49.900 --> 33:51.811
Best leave it alone.

33:52.820 --> 33:54.890
- Yeah, well, oh,
yeah yeah yeah,

33:54.950 --> 33:57.692
best leave it alone, Tony.

34:04.540 --> 34:08.909
(fighting and yelling)

34:15.010 --> 34:18.502
- Exactly what do you
think you're playing at?

34:18.550 --> 34:20.177
We had a bargain.

34:20.220 --> 34:22.381
I would give you half
of Wendell's kingdom,

34:22.430 --> 34:24.887
in return for your cooperation.

34:24.930 --> 34:28.058
- You've gone (inaudible) since
I broke you out of prison.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.766
- It is essential that
the coronation proceed

34:31.820 --> 34:34.527
according to my plan.

34:34.570 --> 34:36.356
If you remain in
Wendell's kingdom

34:36.400 --> 34:38.448
then you'll ruin everything.

34:38.740 --> 34:40.901
A crisis will inevitably ensue.

34:41.700 --> 34:43.577
- What's ensue mean?

34:43.950 --> 34:48.740
- It means, leave Beantown,
return to your kingdom,

34:48.790 --> 34:51.839
or you'll ruin everything!

34:52.750 --> 34:55.799
- I might and I might not.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.627
By the way, how are
my children doing?

34:58.680 --> 35:02.047
- Their intellect and bravery
quite take my breath away.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.715
- Yeah.

35:03.760 --> 35:07.059
Well look after them, I
want them back in one piece.

35:07.100 --> 35:10.012
- If you'll only be
patient, your majesty.

35:10.060 --> 35:13.939
I will give you Wendell's
kingdom on a plate.

35:14.530 --> 35:17.272
- But I'm hungry now.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.560
- Moron!

35:18.610 --> 35:19.690
(glass breaking)

35:19.740 --> 35:21.310
Mirror talk to me!

35:21.370 --> 35:23.440
Why haven't you
found Wendell yet?

35:23.490 --> 35:25.481
- He is with others.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.781
But I cannot see them.

35:27.830 --> 35:29.206
- Who?

35:29.250 --> 35:31.206
- Three travel with Wendell,

35:31.250 --> 35:33.332
one who can talk with him,

35:33.380 --> 35:35.871
and one who can hurt you.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.963
They are traveling down
the river towards us

35:40.010 --> 35:42.467
unknowingly.

35:42.510 --> 35:45.388
- Show me, show me.

35:45.430 --> 35:47.842
- I can not.

35:50.850 --> 35:52.852
- Wolf is with them.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.686
Work on him.

35:54.730 --> 35:56.812
Make him talk to me.

35:57.860 --> 36:01.569
("Night Fever" by the Bee Gees)

36:06.290 --> 36:09.703
- (singing together) I get
the night fever, night fever

36:09.750 --> 36:12.742
We know how to do it

36:12.790 --> 36:15.782
(singing)

36:15.840 --> 36:19.082
I get the night
fever, night fever

36:19.130 --> 36:21.963
We know how to show it

36:22.010 --> 36:25.719
(singing)

36:25.760 --> 36:27.591
Here I am,

36:27.640 --> 36:31.474
waiting for this moment to last

36:31.520 --> 36:35.604
Livin' on the music so fine

36:36.060 --> 36:40.520
(music slowing down)

36:41.610 --> 36:46.149
(yelling)

36:46.830 --> 36:50.698
- Their magic is useless
to brothers Gibb, ha!

36:50.750 --> 36:51.785
- Row faster!

36:51.830 --> 36:54.037
- Shut up, Blue Bell,
I've rowed all night!

36:54.080 --> 36:56.958
- You shut up, Burly.

36:58.130 --> 37:01.293
- Ugh, Blue Bell, stop
eating your head lice.

37:01.340 --> 37:04.082
- I wasn't chewing I was just
keeping it under my tongue.

37:04.130 --> 37:09.306
- Stop talking, and row
faster, Blabberwort, faster!

37:09.350 --> 37:12.638
- Oh, loolq look, look there.

37:16.730 --> 37:18.436
A book!

37:18.480 --> 37:20.778
Women who love men,

37:21.570 --> 37:24.061
- Who hate women.

37:24.610 --> 37:27.158
Ha! Nicey nice.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.826
- [Tony] Wolf? You doing
something about dinner or not?

37:35.870 --> 37:38.703
- Ugh, yeah, uh-huh.

37:41.840 --> 37:45.332
I'm making myself beautiful
for Virginia (laughing)

37:46.840 --> 37:48.171
- Hello, Wolf.

37:48.220 --> 37:50.552
- Ah!

37:51.850 --> 37:53.670
Oh, oh, go away, leave me alone!

37:53.730 --> 37:55.686
- You agreed to obey me.

37:55.730 --> 37:56.765
- No!

37:56.810 --> 37:58.300
- Yes.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.725
I control you.

37:59.770 --> 38:01.146
- No!

38:01.190 --> 38:04.432
- Why can't I see
your companions?

38:04.490 --> 38:07.197
What magic is going on?

38:07.610 --> 38:10.022
- Magic? Well, I...

38:10.080 --> 38:12.401
- Is there food or
isn't there food?

38:12.870 --> 38:14.906
- No, I wasn't
talking to anybody.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.076
I was making dinner.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.332
- Where is it?

38:26.470 --> 38:28.631
Well, you know what I found...

38:28.680 --> 38:32.673
(magical music)

38:50.780 --> 38:52.736
VVha?

39:05.340 --> 39:06.967
(tapping)

39:07.010 --> 39:08.830
Hey, fishy fishy fishy?

39:08.880 --> 39:11.178
(tapping)

39:16.730 --> 39:20.302
(glass breaking)

39:26.610 --> 39:28.146
Here is magic to behold

39:28.200 --> 39:31.067
All that glitters can be gold.

39:40.830 --> 39:43.037
Hello?

39:43.090 --> 39:47.629
(suspenseful music)

39:49.930 --> 39:52.797
(crunching)

40:02.310 --> 40:05.689
- Ow, oh the ﬁnger of fortune.

40:05.730 --> 40:09.314
- [Virginia] Dad? You alright,
I thought I heard a crash?

40:09.360 --> 40:11.237
- Just cleaning up
a little of this

40:11.280 --> 40:13.521
accidental glass breakage.

40:19.120 --> 40:21.668
- Did you put your
finger in that fish?

40:21.710 --> 40:25.532
- No, well technically, yes.

40:25.590 --> 40:26.796
(yelling)

40:26.840 --> 40:28.159
Don't worry about
it, we're rich now,

40:28.210 --> 40:29.871
we're rich, we're our own bank.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.296
I could, you know what,

40:31.340 --> 40:33.388
I could turn this
entire boat into gold.

40:33.430 --> 40:36.638
- Yes and then it would
sink and we would all drown.

40:36.680 --> 40:37.965
- Good point.

40:38.010 --> 40:39.921
OK, I'll wait, I'll wait
until I find the right thing.

40:39.980 --> 40:43.472
And then when I have
this huge lump of gold,

40:43.520 --> 40:44.930
you'll be thanking me.

40:44.980 --> 40:47.687
You will be thanking me!

40:47.730 --> 40:49.277
Oh yes!

40:54.360 --> 40:56.737
- (sniffing) Get some bones.

40:56.780 --> 40:59.692
Jaw bones, gnaw bones.

41:01.830 --> 41:04.242
Must find some bones.

41:06.747 --> 41:11.630
(sniffing)

41:11.630 --> 41:14.337
_ Mistress won't
give me any bones.

41:15.930 --> 41:18.307
Steal some bones.

41:18.350 --> 41:20.966
Bury them under the sheets.

41:21.020 --> 41:24.262
And chew them when
she's gone to bed.

41:26.860 --> 41:30.728
(sniffing)

41:40.120 --> 41:43.453
(dripping)

41:47.420 --> 41:49.456
(sniffing)

41:49.500 --> 41:53.049
Must. Find. Bones.

41:54.170 --> 41:57.219
- Stand up.

42:03.180 --> 42:05.341
Stand up properly.

42:05.390 --> 42:07.267
- I'm scared.

42:07.310 --> 42:09.471
- Of what?

42:09.520 --> 42:11.818
- I'll fall over.

42:15.990 --> 42:19.278
It's so high up here.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.440
Can't I fall on floors?

42:21.490 --> 42:23.697
- Do you know who you are?

42:23.750 --> 42:25.399
- Can I have a biscuit?

42:25.460 --> 42:27.746
- You are not a dog.

42:27.790 --> 42:32.955
You are Prince Wendell, you are
ruler of the Fourth Kingdom.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.912
- Prince Wendell loves
biscuits (panting).

42:35.970 --> 42:37.710
- Get dressed.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.637
You have a whole life to learn.

42:39.680 --> 42:41.671
Before you can be crowned king,

42:41.720 --> 42:44.382
you must be seen to
demonstrate bravery,

42:44.430 --> 42:48.434
loyalty and intelligence.

42:48.770 --> 42:53.013
(panting and barking)

42:54.990 --> 42:57.606
What a challenge.

42:58.780 --> 43:02.238
(hawks calling)

43:10.790 --> 43:13.418
- Oh no.

43:13.460 --> 43:15.087
- What's wrong?

43:15.130 --> 43:17.542
- Uh, nothing, just a feeling.

43:17.590 --> 43:19.330
- Hey, hey, hey,
it's Acorn's boat!

43:19.380 --> 43:20.677
It's moored right there, look.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.381
Watch the finger!

43:22.430 --> 43:24.807
Right there, right there.

43:33.980 --> 43:36.778
- [Prince] Anthony, something
really strange is happening.

43:36.820 --> 43:41.268
I feel, I feel, like I'm
two people at the same time.

43:41.320 --> 43:42.776
- What?

43:42.820 --> 43:44.447
- I have to go back
to that castle.

43:44.490 --> 43:45.696
- What, what castle?

43:45.740 --> 43:47.321
It's an old ruin that
castle, why go there?

43:47.370 --> 43:48.826
Let's go on to Acorn's boat.

43:48.870 --> 43:51.668
- No! I'm sure my
human body is there.

43:53.040 --> 43:54.200
(Splash)

43:54.250 --> 43:55.456
- Wait!

43:55.500 --> 43:56.660
- Oh my god!

43:56.710 --> 43:57.916
- Prince come back!

43:57.960 --> 43:59.507
Come back!

43:59.550 --> 44:00.960
- [Virginia] What
is wrong with him?

44:01.010 --> 44:03.001
- [Tony] Prince!

44:03.050 --> 44:04.790
- Well, we can't go after him.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.135
- But...

44:06.180 --> 44:07.420
- Let's just go find Acorn
and get the mirror back, okay?

44:07.470 --> 44:09.973
- Good idea, just let
him go, let him go.

44:12.100 --> 44:14.432
- Alright, alright.

44:22.610 --> 44:24.908
- Faster! Row faster!

44:24.950 --> 44:27.612
- I can't row any faster,
my hands are bleeding.

44:27.910 --> 44:29.571
- My hands are bleeding!

44:29.620 --> 44:31.576
- Oh suck an elf, Blue Bell!

44:31.620 --> 44:33.326
- Both of you just shut up!

44:33.380 --> 44:35.780
- Shut up, look, there's
the ruined castle.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.126
We should report to the queen.

44:38.170 --> 44:40.752
- Excellent idea, steer
us over to the shore.

44:42.630 --> 44:44.882
- Acorn's been here all morning.

44:44.930 --> 44:47.216
He left less than half hour ago.

44:47.260 --> 44:49.592
- With the rest of the
stuff that was on the boat?

44:49.640 --> 44:51.016
- Yep.

44:51.060 --> 44:52.049
- When's he coming back?

44:52.100 --> 44:53.590
- He's not.

44:53.650 --> 44:56.357
He swapped this lovely boat
for my horse and carriage,

44:56.400 --> 44:58.777
I reckon I got a great deal.

44:58.820 --> 45:00.276
- Well which way did he go?

45:00.320 --> 45:02.811
- He said he'd use the
road through the forest.

45:02.860 --> 45:04.908
If you hurry you
could catch him.

45:04.950 --> 45:07.441
- Good idea, good idea,
let's go, let's go!

45:07.490 --> 45:08.536
- No, but hold on a second.

45:08.580 --> 45:10.741
What about Prince?

45:10.790 --> 45:12.951
- He's off, he wants
to be on his own.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.379
See my heart is breaking,
but let's follow the mirror.

45:16.880 --> 45:20.509
Ton, you said so yourself, he's
been nothing but a nuisance.

45:22.050 --> 45:23.256
- Look...

45:23.300 --> 45:24.756
_ - it feels a little
weird leaVIng him here,

45:24.800 --> 45:26.756
I mean he must have
run off for a reason.

45:26.800 --> 45:28.131
- You're going to
lose that mirror.

45:28.180 --> 45:29.670
- Dad

45:29.720 --> 45:32.132
- OK, wait wait, fifteen minutes
alright, fifteen minutes.

45:36.770 --> 45:38.601
- While we're waiting to eat,

45:38.650 --> 45:40.971
try to keep your tongue
inside your mouth,

45:41.030 --> 45:42.486
it's somewhat vulgar to have it

45:42.530 --> 45:45.192
hanging out all the time.

45:46.910 --> 45:49.322
- I'm starving.

45:49.910 --> 45:51.866
Where's my bowl?

45:51.910 --> 45:54.902
- You're going to
have a lovely meal.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.450
- Ooo!

45:56.500 --> 46:00.413
- Just as soon as
you've learned to use

46:01.130 --> 46:02.700
a fork

46:04.800 --> 46:07.428
and a knife.

46:07.800 --> 46:10.507
Until then you will starve.

46:12.640 --> 46:15.689
Would you like something
to drink your majesty?

46:15.730 --> 46:16.799
- Bowl of water.

46:16.850 --> 46:18.727
- No, a glass of water.

46:18.770 --> 46:21.682
A prince never
drinks from a bowl.

46:22.780 --> 46:25.567
- Glass of water, please.

46:26.610 --> 46:29.522
- Is there anything
else you require?

46:29.570 --> 46:30.776
- Uh, my wooly ball.

46:30.830 --> 46:33.116
- No, we don't play
ball at the table.

46:33.450 --> 46:35.782
- Your majesty, the three
trolls have returned.

46:37.250 --> 46:40.583
- You practice using
your fork and knife

46:40.630 --> 46:43.588
and I will return to
test you in ten minutes.

46:47.760 --> 46:48.715
- Fork.

46:48.760 --> 46:50.751
Knife.

47:01.650 --> 47:04.027
- [Prince] I'm sure I'm here.

47:04.070 --> 47:05.606
It must be me.

47:05.650 --> 47:07.982
I can smell me.

47:13.200 --> 47:16.613
(dog barking)

47:17.870 --> 47:20.532
(barking)

47:20.580 --> 47:24.164
(dog barking)

47:28.260 --> 47:29.045
- You

47:29.090 --> 47:30.580
- [Prince] It's me!

47:32.800 --> 47:33.676
- You.

47:33.720 --> 47:37.133
- [Prince] It's me, I'm you!

47:39.850 --> 47:41.010
- It's you.

47:41.060 --> 47:42.607
It's me.

47:44.570 --> 47:46.060
- [Prince] Yes, yes, good doggy.

47:46.110 --> 47:47.600
Good doggy.

47:47.650 --> 47:49.606
- Four legs, please?

47:49.650 --> 47:51.481
- [Prince] Now, if you can
just reach up and touch me

47:51.530 --> 47:53.316
we can change back.

47:53.660 --> 47:55.821
Oh come on, you
dumb dog, reach up!

47:55.870 --> 47:57.656
Dammit, I can't reach you.

47:57.700 --> 47:58.906
Wait here.

47:58.960 --> 48:01.531
You can't hear me, but
I'm going to go for help.

48:01.580 --> 48:03.628
Now don't worry, I'll be
back in just a minute.

48:03.670 --> 48:05.661
Don't move!

48:06.420 --> 48:09.162
- Where is Prince Wendell?

48:09.220 --> 48:11.711
- Ah, yes, Prince Wendell.

48:12.430 --> 48:14.000
- I sent you to get him.

48:14.050 --> 48:16.052
- A noble mission for any troll.

48:16.100 --> 48:18.386
- So where is he?

48:18.430 --> 48:19.806
- You idiots!

48:19.850 --> 48:21.806
- Ow!

48:24.690 --> 48:26.817
- I've spoken with my mirror.

48:26.860 --> 48:29.272
Prince Wendell is
very near, he may even

48:29.320 --> 48:31.732
be in Rivertown by now.

48:31.780 --> 48:33.520
- Wow, that's a stroke of luck.

48:33.570 --> 48:35.697
- Go and find him!

48:35.740 --> 48:38.447
If you return again
without the dog,

48:38.490 --> 48:41.744
I will make you eat
each other's hearts.

48:45.460 --> 48:47.746
- Oh, yuck.

48:50.590 --> 48:54.139
- Well that didn't go
too badly considering.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.176
(goats bleating)

48:57.220 --> 48:58.551
- Prince?

48:59.430 --> 49:01.091
Pnnce?

49:02.520 --> 49:04.010
Pnnce?

49:05.100 --> 49:06.431
- [Prince] Anthony!

49:06.480 --> 49:07.469
- Prince!

49:07.520 --> 49:09.067
- [Prince] I found myself!

49:09.110 --> 49:10.225
- Look out!

49:10.280 --> 49:11.679
Look out!

49:12.450 --> 49:15.658
(yelling)

49:17.740 --> 49:20.573
(yelling)

49:22.460 --> 49:26.703
(growling)

49:26.750 --> 49:28.798
Leave him alone, alright?

49:29.460 --> 49:32.167
(dog barking)

49:33.720 --> 49:36.837
He's just a dog, you cowards!

49:43.270 --> 49:44.510
- Tony?

49:44.560 --> 49:46.642
- Dad?

49:46.690 --> 49:47.930
- Tony?

49:47.980 --> 49:49.436
Tony?

49:49.480 --> 49:50.390
- Hey!

49:50.440 --> 49:51.429
- Dad!

49:51.480 --> 49:52.686
Oh, thank God you're alright.

49:52.740 --> 49:53.809
Did you find Prince?

49:53.860 --> 49:54.940
-Uh

49:54.990 --> 49:56.275
- Are you okay?

49:56.320 --> 49:57.776
- I defeated the trolls.

49:57.820 --> 49:59.071
- Oh good.

49:59.120 --> 49:59.939
- That's the good news.

49:59.990 --> 50:00.820
- Excellent.

50:00.870 --> 50:02.826
Is there any bad news, Ton?

50:03.580 --> 50:06.617
- Do you think that boatman
might have, a chisel?

50:08.040 --> 50:11.043
- Dad, what exactly
is the bad news?

50:12.510 --> 50:14.626
- Well...

50:20.260 --> 50:24.720
I think he'll come apart from
the others pretty easily.

50:37.570 --> 50:39.902
- Hunstman.

50:44.250 --> 50:48.118
- Neither Wolf nor the trolls
have captured the dog yet.

50:48.460 --> 50:50.621
Someone is testing me.

50:50.670 --> 50:53.878
- Compared to you,
they're nothing.

50:54.800 --> 50:57.837
- Why can't I see
them in my mirrors?

50:57.880 --> 51:00.508
Somethings clouding my vision.

51:01.470 --> 51:03.711
But, they are near.

51:04.060 --> 51:05.766
They have left the river.

51:05.810 --> 51:08.438
They're about to
enter your forest.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.687
- I will find them.

51:13.110 --> 51:16.739
Nothing escapes
(kiss) The Huntsman.

51:18.280 --> 51:23.229
(dramatic music)

51:29.790 --> 51:32.452
- Every aspect of
my life, I am guided

51:32.500 --> 51:36.209
to my highest happiness
and fulfillment,

51:36.260 --> 51:38.546
every day in every
way I am becoming

51:38.590 --> 51:41.002
a new and better man.

51:41.050 --> 51:45.009
I am sensitive to
the needs of women.

51:45.720 --> 51:47.676
I am listening to my emotions,

51:47.730 --> 51:50.597
and I am one with myself.

51:50.650 --> 51:54.108
And...

51:55.730 --> 52:00.690
Okay, I am full of
peace and serenity,

52:02.490 --> 52:05.618
and I have control

52:06.120 --> 52:08.281
over all of my desires and,

52:10.540 --> 52:12.576
and,

52:12.630 --> 52:14.120
Tony!

52:14.170 --> 52:16.627
You're ruining the bacon,
I can smell it burning!

52:20.590 --> 52:22.717
Bacon!

52:22.760 --> 52:24.170
- I feel terrible.

52:24.220 --> 52:25.710
Look at him!

52:25.760 --> 52:27.762
It was a simple magic fish
spell gold finger mistake, Tony,

52:27.810 --> 52:29.380
It was almost predictable.

52:29.430 --> 52:31.386
- But I've killed him.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.146
- Oh, things have a way
of bouncing back here,

52:35.360 --> 52:37.976
- Really? You're not
just saying that?

52:38.030 --> 52:39.520
- I'm afraid I am
just saying that.

52:39.570 --> 52:41.310
- What?

52:41.360 --> 52:44.193
- Watch this simple
Prince alertness test.

52:44.570 --> 52:47.027
Come on, come on!

52:47.080 --> 52:49.822
Come on, fetch! Fetch!

52:49.870 --> 52:51.360
- That's not funny.

52:51.410 --> 52:53.617
- It could get funnier
if we keep on doing it.

52:53.670 --> 52:55.456
- Why are you two
still sitting here?

52:55.500 --> 52:56.376
I told you to get packed up.

52:56.420 --> 52:57.546
- We're making sandwiches.

52:57.590 --> 52:59.046
- We're making sandwiches.

52:59.550 --> 53:01.620
- Look, the mirror is getting
further away all the time,

53:01.670 --> 53:04.719
if we lose this trail now
we're never gomg to get home.

53:05.930 --> 53:08.000
- Oh, but Virginia,
breakfast is bacon,

53:08.060 --> 53:10.346
and nothing sets my nostrils
twitching like bacon

53:10.390 --> 53:11.721
in the morning.

53:11.770 --> 53:13.510
Little pigs parading
up and down with their

53:13.560 --> 53:15.892
curly corkscrew tails!

53:16.690 --> 53:20.399
Ah! Bacon sizzling away
on an iron frying pan!

53:20.940 --> 53:24.569
Ah! Basted, roasted,
toasted, nibble it, chew it,

53:24.610 --> 53:26.771
bite right through it,
wobble it, gobble it,

53:26.820 --> 53:31.689
wrap it round a couple of
chickens and am I ravenous!

53:39.710 --> 53:42.008
- Let's finish
these on the move.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.540
- Wait, wait a minute, Virginia.

53:44.590 --> 53:47.297
Virginia, wait, Virginia.

53:48.100 --> 53:51.172
Virginia, what do you see?

53:51.720 --> 53:54.052
- Um, a lot of trees.

53:54.100 --> 53:56.307
- No, you see nothing.

53:56.770 --> 53:58.510
Look at everything
that happened here

53:58.560 --> 54:00.858
last night while you slept.

54:01.530 --> 54:03.737
- Like what?

54:03.780 --> 54:05.065
- You see that clearing?

54:05.110 --> 54:06.566
- Yeah.

54:06.610 --> 54:08.658
- About midnight, a badger
trotted across there.

54:08.700 --> 54:10.941
And then two hours
later, a mother fox took

54:10.990 --> 54:13.493
the path, but our
presence spooked her so

54:13.540 --> 54:15.360
she went back into the trees.

54:15.410 --> 54:16.991
Then a half an hour after that,

54:17.040 --> 54:19.452
another fox appeared,
male this time,

54:19.500 --> 54:21.240
young and out courting, I
reckon he got his porridge

54:21.300 --> 54:23.586
because I didn't
see him come back.

54:24.380 --> 54:25.961
Or, or over there.

54:26.010 --> 54:27.250
You see over there?

54:27.300 --> 54:29.256
Where the undergrowth
is disturbed?

54:29.300 --> 54:32.554
A noisy little wild boar
was snufing about,

54:32.600 --> 54:35.979
I can't believe he
didn't wake you up.

54:36.770 --> 54:37.930
Oh, oh, oh, and right
in front of you,

54:37.980 --> 54:39.720
you see the passage of the mole,

54:39.770 --> 54:42.182
or over there, a stag
and a doe watched the sun

54:42.230 --> 54:44.107
come up with me, and
that's not to mention

54:44.150 --> 54:47.654
the all night rabbit party, or
the weasels or the pheasants,

54:47.700 --> 54:50.157
or that, that owl.

54:50.950 --> 54:53.657
And you saw nothing.

54:54.330 --> 54:56.537
- I stand corrected.

54:56.580 --> 54:59.413
- You most certainly do.

54:59.790 --> 55:01.951
- Great can we go?

55:04.510 --> 55:06.250
- Oh Tony?

55:08.260 --> 55:13.175
(fairy tale music)

55:25.610 --> 55:29.694
- I am but poor old
lady, spare me some food.

55:30.070 --> 55:33.369
- Sorry, we're down to our
last six bacon sandwiches.

55:33.740 --> 55:35.116
- Good sir

55:35.160 --> 55:37.537
- I only give to
registered charities.

55:37.580 --> 55:39.821
- Young lady?

55:39.870 --> 55:42.748
Spare me some food, please?

55:42.790 --> 55:45.497
- I'll give you what I have.

55:45.550 --> 55:48.292
- Virginia! You're
such a soft touch.

55:48.340 --> 55:49.546
- Yeah, soft touch.

55:49.590 --> 55:50.625
- Hey!

55:50.680 --> 55:52.636
- Since you have been
kind I have a lesson,

55:52.680 --> 55:55.217
for all of you!

55:55.560 --> 55:57.630
Take this stick.

55:58.430 --> 55:59.931
Break it.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.556
And this one.

56:06.530 --> 56:08.566
Put these three together.

56:08.610 --> 56:10.737
Now, try to break them.

56:12.660 --> 56:14.400
- I can't.

56:14.450 --> 56:15.485
- That is the lesson.

56:15.530 --> 56:17.111
- Good lesson.

56:17.160 --> 56:18.570
- Oh wow.

56:18.620 --> 56:20.702
I think maybe that was
only worth one sandwich.

56:20.750 --> 56:24.413
- When the students are
ready, the teacher appears.

56:24.460 --> 56:26.587
- You didn't go to my school.

56:26.630 --> 56:28.586
- Um, excuse me, miss?

56:28.630 --> 56:31.372
Did you happen to see
a dwarf driving a cart?

56:31.430 --> 56:33.716
- Very early this
morning, he took the main

56:33.760 --> 56:36.558
road through the forest,
but you must not.

56:36.890 --> 56:39.552
You must leave the path.

56:40.680 --> 56:42.307
- Wait!

56:42.350 --> 56:44.477
The road's the only safe
thing in the whole forest.

56:44.520 --> 56:45.817
- Not for you.

56:45.860 --> 56:47.816
Someone is following you.

56:47.860 --> 56:49.521
They intend to kill you.

56:49.570 --> 56:50.639
-Ah

56:50.690 --> 56:54.023
- Whoa, wait, what is
this intent to kill?

56:55.700 --> 56:59.784
- There's a man who controls
this forest, The Huntsman.

57:00.580 --> 57:03.572
I've heard he serves the queen.

57:03.620 --> 57:06.088
But he certainly wouldn't
expect us to leave the only road

57:06.130 --> 57:07.586
and go into the forest itself.

57:07.630 --> 57:09.586
- Why not?

57:09.880 --> 57:11.666
- Because only a
fool would go into

57:11.720 --> 57:13.961
the disenchanted forest.

57:14.470 --> 57:16.347
- Well let's not.

57:16.390 --> 57:19.769
- Okay, from now
on, I will lead.

57:19.810 --> 57:22.802
You step where I step.

57:24.650 --> 57:27.016
- Wait, I

57:31.610 --> 57:36.559
(dramatic music)

57:45.750 --> 57:50.699
(haunting winds)

58:24.120 --> 58:28.079
(dog barking)

58:47.270 --> 58:52.219
(dramatic music)

59:15.630 --> 59:17.541
- Is it just me or
do you hear moaning?

59:17.590 --> 59:19.080
- I hear moaning.

59:19.130 --> 59:22.133
- I hear lots of things,
the forest is magical.

59:24.890 --> 59:26.721
-Oh no

59:26.770 --> 59:29.762
- [Virginia] Cripes,
what is this place?

59:32.270 --> 59:35.228
Do you actually know
where we're going?

59:35.530 --> 59:37.646
- I'm following my nose.

59:41.570 --> 59:44.323
- Who is this huntsman?

59:47.250 --> 59:49.070
Ah!

1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:04.421
(owl hooting)

1:00:04.470 --> 1:00:06.802
We can't walk all night.

1:00:06.850 --> 1:00:07.839
- Yes we can.

1:00:07.890 --> 1:00:09.380
- Whoa, shh.

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:10.555
Do you hear something?

1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:13.262
(horse snorting)

1:00:16.860 --> 1:00:20.569
(voices)

1:00:23.410 --> 1:00:25.571
- Gypsies.

1:00:30.370 --> 1:00:31.667
- What do we do now?

1:00:31.710 --> 1:00:33.666
- Come!

1:00:33.710 --> 1:00:35.996
Join us of course.

1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:55.801
- Poachers. They'll kill
us if they so choose.

1:00:55.860 --> 1:00:57.646
Do not refuse
anything they offer,

1:00:57.690 --> 1:00:59.487
but do not consume anything

1:00:59.530 --> 1:01:02.442
that you haven't already
seen them eat first.

1:01:02.490 --> 1:01:05.197
- It's like having dinner
at your grandmother's house.

1:01:05.820 --> 1:01:08.402
- I think we should sit down.

1:01:10.540 --> 1:01:14.453
(accordion music)

1:01:34.190 --> 1:01:37.648
- This is the best
hedgehog I've had in weeks!

1:02:01.590 --> 1:02:05.503
(clapping)

1:02:06.260 --> 1:02:09.047
- Now it's your turn, stranger.

1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:12.012
- Oh, well, no, I
don't actually play.

1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:14.090
- Then sing us a song.

1:02:14.140 --> 1:02:15.630
- Not a singer.

1:02:15.690 --> 1:02:17.510
- Tony, sing!

1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:19.812
Let's not insult our hosts.

1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:23.108
- I, I can't think of any songs.

1:02:23.150 --> 1:02:25.607
- Is our hospitality
not worth a song?

1:02:25.650 --> 1:02:28.369
- I don't, I can't.

1:02:28.700 --> 1:02:30.827
Sure.

1:02:35.620 --> 1:02:37.531
Um.

1:02:42.420 --> 1:02:46.129
Picked up a boy,
just south of Mobile

1:02:46.550 --> 1:02:49.929
Gave him a ride, filled
him with a hot meal

1:02:50.850 --> 1:02:54.479
I was sixteen he was 21

1:02:55.390 --> 1:02:59.144
Gypsies, tramps and thieves

1:03:00.020 --> 1:03:03.604
We heard it from the people
in the town they called us

1:03:04.110 --> 1:03:07.193
Gypsies, tramps and thieves

1:03:07.610 --> 1:03:09.908
And every night, the
men would come around

1:03:09.950 --> 1:03:12.077
And lay their money down

1:03:16.580 --> 1:03:18.286
- That was good, Dad.

1:03:18.330 --> 1:03:20.537
- [Tony] Hey, well, I

1:03:22.500 --> 1:03:26.459
(dramatic music)

1:03:26.510 --> 1:03:28.171
- Set me free!

1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:30.296
Set us free!

1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:32.420
Please, set us free.

1:03:32.470 --> 1:03:34.381
We're just little victims.

1:03:34.890 --> 1:03:36.346
- Magic birds.

1:03:36.390 --> 1:03:37.800
Very rare, very hard to catch.

1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:40.186
Only the gypsies know
how to catch them.

1:03:40.230 --> 1:03:43.222
- Little victims,
you understand that

1:03:43.270 --> 1:03:44.646
Little victims.

1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:47.641
- What will happen to them?

1:03:47.690 --> 1:03:48.645
- They'll have
their wings broken,

1:03:48.700 --> 1:03:50.770
be sold to rich people.

1:03:50.820 --> 1:03:51.900
- We won't will we?

1:03:51.950 --> 1:03:53.190
That's awful.

1:03:54.660 --> 1:03:57.288
- See some people,
they eat them,

1:03:57.750 --> 1:03:59.490
believing that they
absorb their magic.

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:01.035
- They don't do they?

1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:02.536
That's terrible.

1:04:02.580 --> 1:04:04.411
I have six little babies
waiting to be fed.

1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:06.456
They're starving to
death without me.

1:04:06.510 --> 1:04:07.579
- That's awful.

1:04:07.630 --> 1:04:09.416
Set us free!

1:04:09.470 --> 1:04:11.040
Please set us free.

1:04:13.050 --> 1:04:14.551
- Is he real gold?

1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:15.715
- What? No, no.

1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:17.341
No, no, no, no, oh please don't.

1:04:17.390 --> 1:04:18.766
No, no it's just gold paint.

1:04:18.810 --> 1:04:20.721
I bought a couple, a pair, to
put a the end of my driveway.

1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:23.511
(dramatic music)

1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:25.471
- Set up a table.

1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:27.818
(owl calling)

1:04:28.530 --> 1:04:30.942
I see great wealth
coming to you.

1:04:30.990 --> 1:04:32.810
- Yeah, that's what
I like to hear.

1:04:32.870 --> 1:04:34.940
- And passings,
straight through.

1:04:34.990 --> 1:04:37.151
- That was the, bean I had.

1:04:39.330 --> 1:04:41.286
And what about the future?

1:04:41.330 --> 1:04:43.207
- I find The Fool

1:04:43.540 --> 1:04:44.416
- Uh-huh, and that card?

1:04:44.460 --> 1:04:46.121
What's that card?

1:04:46.170 --> 1:04:47.831
- The Fool's friend, the Oaf.

1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:52.829
He is joined by the Buffoon
and the Village Idiot.

1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:56.801
- Well, uh

1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:04.391
- I will read the girl.

1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:05.976
- No thanks.

1:05:11.320 --> 1:05:15.438
(violin music)

1:05:20.910 --> 1:05:23.367
- You are full of anger.

1:05:25.170 --> 1:05:28.458
You conceal much about yourself.

1:05:30.590 --> 1:05:33.423
I need a lock of your hair.

1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:44.848
(magical sounds)

1:05:51.900 --> 1:05:56.690
You have a great destiny which
stretches way back in time.

1:05:59.030 --> 1:06:00.406
- I'm just a waitress
so I don't think

1:06:00.450 --> 1:06:02.577
there's any prizes so far.

1:06:05.670 --> 1:06:07.626
for leaving you.

1:06:10.710 --> 1:06:12.507
- As I said, I'm not
really interested in

1:06:12.550 --> 1:06:14.415
having my fortune read.

1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:19.959
- Love and romance, please.

1:06:20.010 --> 1:06:22.171
Marriage, children, how
long is it going to take

1:06:22.220 --> 1:06:24.176
for the creamy girl of
my dreams to say yes,

1:06:24.230 --> 1:06:25.800
that sort of thing.

1:06:30.820 --> 1:06:33.311
- I see death.

1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:36.271
Young girl dead.

1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:38.060
Torn to pieces.

1:06:38.870 --> 1:06:40.519
- No!

1:06:42.620 --> 1:06:43.746
No.

1:06:43.790 --> 1:06:45.200
See, I was thinking
more along the lines of

1:06:45.250 --> 1:06:47.571
three girls and two boys?

1:06:47.620 --> 1:06:49.417
- I see a fire being built.

1:06:49.460 --> 1:06:50.916
- Uh-oh.

1:06:51.670 --> 1:06:53.877
- You are going to
be burned on it.

1:06:53.920 --> 1:06:55.660
- No! No.

1:06:56.550 --> 1:06:59.212
- You are not what you seem.

1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:01.756
You are a wolf.

1:07:06.810 --> 1:07:09.552
- And so is your grandson.

1:07:17.030 --> 1:07:19.601
- You must stay with us tonight.

1:07:20.070 --> 1:07:23.983
Friends must stay together
in the dangerous forest.

1:07:25.410 --> 1:07:26.456
- Yeah.

1:07:37.090 --> 1:07:40.548
(howling)

1:07:44.220 --> 1:07:47.348
(birds calling)

1:07:51.270 --> 1:07:53.477
- Please set us free!

1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:57.604
- Set us free set
us free set us free

1:07:59.610 --> 1:08:01.521
- Set me free!

1:08:01.570 --> 1:08:03.777
- Please set us free.

1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:11.362
(dramatic music)

1:08:32.690 --> 1:08:36.319
(birds singing)

1:09:02.180 --> 1:09:05.593
- Set us free! Set us free!

1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:07.460
- Please set us free!

1:09:08.180 --> 1:09:10.091
- Set me free!

1:09:14.650 --> 1:09:16.561
- Please set us free!

1:09:19.570 --> 1:09:21.140
- Set me free!

1:09:21.190 --> 1:09:22.566
- Please set us free!

1:09:28.030 --> 1:09:30.078
- Please set me free!

1:09:31.410 --> 1:09:33.241
- What the hell is she doing?

1:09:33.290 --> 1:09:34.530
- Set me free!

1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:38.746
- Virginia!

1:09:40.510 --> 1:09:41.716
- Don't don't!

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:43.671
- Come on!

1:09:50.810 --> 1:09:53.517
(crashing)

1:09:54.390 --> 1:09:56.608
- [Tony] Go, go go,
let's get out of here.

1:09:56.650 --> 1:09:57.719
We gotta go!

1:09:57.770 --> 1:09:58.816
Go go!

1:09:58.860 --> 1:09:59.929
- After them!

1:09:59.980 --> 1:10:01.777
Quick!

1:10:02.400 --> 1:10:04.106
- Virginia?

1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:08.029
(dramatic music)

1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:19.369
(yelling)

1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:45.351
- Ah!

1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:48.402
(yelling)

1:10:48.450 --> 1:10:51.362
- [Fortune Teller] Come back!

1:10:52.830 --> 1:10:55.287
Come back!

1:11:00.250 --> 1:11:01.831
- [Wolf] I don't understand,

1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:04.587
the old woman
called off the hunt.

1:11:07.050 --> 1:11:08.881
Let's just get going, the
sooner we get out of this forest

1:11:08.930 --> 1:11:10.386
the better.

1:11:10.430 --> 1:11:11.499
Help me get Prince
up on the path.

1:11:11.550 --> 1:11:12.596
- Oh, can't we just bury him?

1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:14.210
We can always come back
sometime in the future.

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:15.510
- I'm not going to
leave him, alright?

1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:18.017
I got him into this mess,
I'm going to get him out.

1:11:18.060 --> 1:11:21.143
- [Wolf] (growling)
I wish I knew why

1:11:21.190 --> 1:11:22.851
they gave up so easily.

1:11:22.900 --> 1:11:24.982
That's not like gypsies at all.

1:11:30.070 --> 1:11:33.619
(bubeng)

1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:42.532
- Stretch it, twist
it, make it grow

1:11:42.590 --> 1:11:45.548
Like a river, make it flow,

1:11:45.590 --> 1:11:48.798
make it pull and pinch and tweak

1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:52.549
make it grow until
she grows weak

1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:57.424
make her moan and scream and cry

1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:02.349
make her wish that
she would die!

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:16.283
(horse neighing)

1:12:22.580 --> 1:12:27.540
- All poachers will be killed
by order of The Huntsman.

1:12:28.340 --> 1:12:31.082
(hawk calling)

1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:39.098
He's here! He's here!

1:12:43.100 --> 1:12:45.398
- He's over there, I
saw something move.

1:12:47.860 --> 1:12:51.523
(screaming)

1:12:54.030 --> 1:12:58.990
(dramatic music)

1:13:45.710 --> 1:13:48.918
- What? What are you looking at?

1:13:49.300 --> 1:13:50.836
- Um, your hair,

1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:53.542
it looks, well, different.

1:13:53.590 --> 1:13:54.716
- Oh yeah, that's because I

1:13:54.760 --> 1:13:57.467
went to the_
beautICIan last night.

1:13:57.510 --> 1:13:59.307
- No, it's not that.

1:14:02.230 --> 1:14:03.970
It's grown.

1:14:04.020 --> 1:14:05.897
- Grown?

1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:08.568
- So it has.

1:14:08.610 --> 1:14:10.271
- Oh my God.

1:14:12.030 --> 1:14:15.067
Oh my God, it is longer.

1:14:15.490 --> 1:14:17.902
That's so weird.

1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:19.861
What's happening?

1:14:19.910 --> 1:14:21.116
- The gypsies.

1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:23.196
Of course they had
some of your hair.

1:14:23.250 --> 1:14:25.115
The gypsies have cursed you!

1:14:25.170 --> 1:14:26.410
- Cursed me?

1:14:26.460 --> 1:14:27.495
What do you mean cursed?

1:14:27.540 --> 1:14:29.588
What am I supposed to do?

1:14:31.670 --> 1:14:34.127
- Um, braid it?

1:14:37.300 --> 1:14:41.213
(thunder claps)

1:14:43.430 --> 1:14:44.556
- [Virginia] Ow, stop it!

1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:45.806
You're jerking it!

1:14:45.850 --> 1:14:47.260
- [Wolf] I'm sorry,
it's not that easy.

1:14:47.310 --> 1:14:48.390
You've got a lot of split ends.

1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:49.429
- [Virginia] Ugh!

1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:50.606
' [Tony] How long is it now?

1:14:50.650 --> 1:14:52.686
- [Wolf] Oh, don't ask.

1:14:53.690 --> 1:14:56.397
' [Tony] Where are we going?

1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:05.408
(thunder claps)

1:15:05.460 --> 1:15:06.779
- Ow!

1:15:06.830 --> 1:15:08.115
- [Tony] Wait, wait wait.

1:15:08.170 --> 1:15:09.489
- This is crazy, we
can't keep going,

1:15:09.540 --> 1:15:10.666
we've got to stop somewhere.

1:15:10.710 --> 1:15:11.916
- Well where are we
going to find shelter

1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:13.120
in the middle of the forest?

1:15:13.170 --> 1:15:15.411
- I don't know
(thunder claps)

1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:18.081
- Look!

1:15:18.130 --> 1:15:21.349
(thunder claps)

1:15:30.060 --> 1:15:32.563
- Anyone home?

1:15:37.490 --> 1:15:40.482
- [Wolf] It's okay, no one's
been here for a long time.

1:15:41.370 --> 1:15:43.941
(thunder claps)

1:15:51.420 --> 1:15:54.628
- Hey, hey come look at this.

1:15:57.970 --> 1:16:01.542
(thunder claps)

1:16:01.590 --> 1:16:03.501
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:05.676
- This is Snow White's cottage.

1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:09.133
Goodness, gracious me, this
is the Seven Dwarves' house!

1:16:09.190 --> 1:16:11.431
It's been lost_ for
a very long time.

1:16:11.480 --> 1:16:13.266
- Those beds are so tiny.

1:16:13.310 --> 1:16:16.393
- See this is a great
piece of our history.

1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:17.987
It's a pity Prince is a stiff,

1:16:18.030 --> 1:16:20.521
this is his grandma's cottage!

1:16:20.570 --> 1:16:22.561
Gripes!

1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:26.363
We really shouldn't have a
fire if someone's following us.

1:16:26.410 --> 1:16:29.368
- I don't care, I'm not
going to bed with wet hair.

1:16:29.410 --> 1:16:31.162
- [Wolf] (growling)

1:16:31.210 --> 1:16:34.418
- You know, here's a question
I never thought I'd be asking.

1:16:34.460 --> 1:16:37.418
What happened to Snow White
after she married the prince?

1:16:38.170 --> 1:16:41.378
- She became a great queen.

1:16:41.430 --> 1:16:44.422
One of the five women
who changed history.

1:16:44.470 --> 1:16:45.926
- Five women?

1:16:45.970 --> 1:16:48.461
- Snow White, Cinderella,
Queen Riding Hood,

1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:51.387
Grettel the Great,
and the Lady Rapunzel.

1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:53.556
They formed the
first five kingdoms,

1:16:53.610 --> 1:16:56.397
brought peace to all the lands.

1:16:56.440 --> 1:16:59.102
But they're all dead now.

1:16:59.610 --> 1:17:01.851
Some say Cinderella's
still alive,

1:17:01.900 --> 1:17:05.449
but _no_ one's seen her in
public in nearly 40 years.

1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:10.117
She would be nearly
200 years old.

1:17:12.670 --> 1:17:15.537
The days of "happy
ever after" are gone.

1:17:17.750 --> 1:17:20.207
These are dark times.

1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:23.580
- [Tony] (yawning)

1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:26.677
(crickets)

1:17:28.180 --> 1:17:31.809
(snoring)

1:17:48.580 --> 1:17:51.617
- [Virginia] What'd you say
to that boy in the gypsy camp?

1:17:51.660 --> 1:17:53.992
- Nothing much, just wolf stuff.

1:17:55.080 --> 1:17:56.741
- What's wolf stuff?

1:17:56.790 --> 1:17:58.417
- Oh, I didn't need to
say anything to him,

1:17:58.460 --> 1:18:00.371
I was just with him.

1:18:00.420 --> 1:18:03.332
He had never seen another
wolf and he was scared.

1:18:04.220 --> 1:18:07.098
It's a lonely path in
life to be different,

1:18:07.140 --> 1:18:09.005
as you know.

1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:15.306
Where's your mom?

1:18:17.810 --> 1:18:19.892
- I have no idea.

1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:23.432
She walked out on
us when I was seven.

1:18:23.780 --> 1:18:26.408
- Sad to be left when
you're so little.

1:18:28.700 --> 1:18:31.578
She's never really
been a part of my life.

1:18:31.620 --> 1:18:34.111
- What happened?

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:37.740
- She just left home.

1:18:38.210 --> 1:18:40.872
Wouldn't you if you
were married to my dad?

1:18:42.090 --> 1:18:44.752
They're just totally
different people.

1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:46.506
You've met my
grandmother, right?

1:18:46.550 --> 1:18:47.539
My mother was like that.

1:18:47.590 --> 1:18:48.841
It was a complete mismatch, they

1:18:48.890 --> 1:18:51.302
never should have gotten
married to begin with.

1:18:51.850 --> 1:18:53.511
Amway,

1:18:54.180 --> 1:18:56.182
it was a long time ago.

1:18:57.850 --> 1:18:59.647
- Well where is she now?

1:19:01.020 --> 1:19:02.647
- I haven't a clue.

1:19:02.690 --> 1:19:05.238
And I couldn't
care less, really.

1:19:07.860 --> 1:19:11.489
- Don't you wonder
what she's like?

1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:14.780
- She could have gotten
back in touch with me,

1:19:14.830 --> 1:19:16.491
but she didn't.

1:19:16.540 --> 1:19:17.996
And that's fine,
you know, I mean

1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:19.667
she doesn't want me, I'm
not going to waste my energy

1:19:19.710 --> 1:19:21.337
thinking about her.

1:19:21.380 --> 1:19:22.369
- Oh.

1:19:22.420 --> 1:19:24.081
- Oh what?

1:19:24.130 --> 1:19:26.371
- Oh. Just oh.

1:19:27.340 --> 1:19:29.137
Oh.

1:19:29.180 --> 1:19:32.593
As in, an encouraging,
noncommittal noise.

1:19:33.470 --> 1:19:35.552
Try not to comment
as you listen,

1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:37.682
as my very good
self-help books tell me.

1:19:38.020 --> 1:19:40.341
(sneezing)

1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:51.272
You must do something
magnificent with your life.

1:19:52.830 --> 1:19:55.401
- Oh yeah? Why?

1:19:56.080 --> 1:19:58.958
- Because your
hurt is very great.

1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.377
- They just split up okay? God!

1:20:01.420 --> 1:20:03.741
Doesn't that ever happen
where you come from?

1:20:03.800 --> 1:20:05.336
- Of course not.

1:20:05.380 --> 1:20:06.699
We either live
happily ever after,

1:20:06.760 --> 1:20:09.376
or we get killed
by horrible curses.

1:20:14.390 --> 1:20:16.517
You don't trust nobody.

1:20:16.560 --> 1:20:18.801
- I don't trust you, no.

1:20:19.390 --> 1:20:21.187
- Well,

1:20:22.980 --> 1:20:25.813
you may not get hurt,

1:20:26.320 --> 1:20:28.106
but huff puff,

1:20:28.150 --> 1:20:30.653
you won't get loved either.

1:20:32.620 --> 1:20:36.488
(birds singing)

1:21:01.690 --> 1:21:03.851
- My God.

1:21:04.980 --> 1:21:07.437
Oh my God!

1:21:07.480 --> 1:21:09.277
- What? What?

1:21:09.320 --> 1:21:10.639
Goodness me!

1:21:10.700 --> 1:21:12.440
Cripes!

1:21:12.490 --> 1:21:14.902
- It's everywhere!

1:21:14.950 --> 1:21:16.360
What am I going to do?

1:21:16.410 --> 1:21:18.150
- [Wolf] Tony? Tony?

1:21:18.200 --> 1:21:19.406
Virginia, it's...

1:21:19.450 --> 1:21:22.328
- [Virginia] It's
growing up the stairs!

1:21:29.510 --> 1:21:31.125
- You know what, it's no good.

1:21:31.170 --> 1:21:33.377
Nothing cuts through this.

1:21:35.220 --> 1:21:38.428
- Well what if it
never stops growmg?

1:21:38.470 --> 1:21:41.382
I'm going to die of long hair!

1:21:41.430 --> 1:21:42.806
- No, no

1:21:42.850 --> 1:21:44.761
- [Bird] Don't despair.

1:21:45.310 --> 1:21:47.437
Because you saved my life,

1:21:47.480 --> 1:21:49.641
I will tell you how
to cut your hair.

1:21:49.690 --> 1:21:51.317
- Oh please!

1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:54.488
- Deep in the forest there is
a Woodsman with a magic ax,

1:21:54.530 --> 1:21:57.772
that when swung, never fails
to cut whatever it hits.

1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:01.497
And it will cut your
hair and kill the curse.

1:22:01.540 --> 1:22:03.076
- Okay, we better
get moving before

1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:04.326
Virginia's hair gets too long.

1:22:04.370 --> 1:22:05.701
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1:22:05.750 --> 1:22:07.536
oh, these apples look
good though, huh?

1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:10.371
- No Tony! No,
what are you doing?

1:22:10.420 --> 1:22:11.705
Don't eat that apple!

1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:13.375
- Hey, hey, hey, why not?

1:22:13.420 --> 1:22:14.796
- Think about where you are,

1:22:14.840 --> 1:22:16.831
Snow White's cottage.

1:22:17.300 --> 1:22:19.006
- Yeah?

1:22:19.060 --> 1:22:20.709
- That apple tree has
probably grown from

1:22:20.770 --> 1:22:23.307
the pips of the apple
that poisoned her!

1:22:23.350 --> 1:22:26.399
- Ugh, is nothing safe
around this crazy place?

1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:27.976
- Come along, we have
much to do if we're

1:22:28.020 --> 1:22:29.317
going to keep up
with the mirror.

1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:31.180
- Okay, you got the
hair, I got the dog.

1:22:31.480 --> 1:22:35.439
(suspenseful music)

1:22:44.870 --> 1:22:46.576
Just be careful, you
got this trip here,

1:22:46.620 --> 1:22:48.121
- No kidding?

1:22:48.170 --> 1:22:49.489
It's tripping.

1:22:49.540 --> 1:22:51.246
- You know, I didn't curse you.

1:22:51.300 --> 1:22:53.450
- Oh, oh, oh, I got a scent.

1:22:53.510 --> 1:22:55.410
I'm sure it's The
Huntsman, he's near.

1:22:55.470 --> 1:22:57.210
We must move faster.

1:22:57.260 --> 1:22:59.251
- Hello? I can't go any faster!

1:22:59.300 --> 1:23:01.461
- Virginia this man is going
to catch us within an hour

1:23:01.510 --> 1:23:03.592
- Alright, alright alright
what are we going to do?

1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:05.050
- I'll hide you.

1:23:05.100 --> 1:23:07.307
This Hunstman is very
good, but he follows tracks

1:23:07.350 --> 1:23:09.511
_he cannot smell
things like an animal.

1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:11.221
I lead him in a
big circle and then

1:23:11.270 --> 1:23:12.350
come back for you tomorrow.

1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:13.355
- What?

1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:15.027
- Now hurry! Let's
start with Prince.

1:23:21.740 --> 1:23:23.731
That's the best I can do.

1:23:23.790 --> 1:23:25.951
Are you okay?

1:23:27.750 --> 1:23:30.162
Now, don't breathe.

1:23:30.210 --> 1:23:31.666
Okay.

1:23:36.970 --> 1:23:39.791
Don't breathe at all
until I return, okay?

1:23:40.930 --> 1:23:42.500
Okay, good.

1:23:51.690 --> 1:23:56.309
(suspenseful music)

1:24:42.870 --> 1:24:47.819
(suspenseful music)

1:25:10.310 --> 1:25:12.972
(sneezing)

1:25:13.350 --> 1:25:15.932
- Virginia get out, come on

1:25:16.900 --> 1:25:19.277
run run!

1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:21.777
Hurry, follow me!

1:25:21.820 --> 1:25:24.232
Run! Run!

1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:29.828
Virginia!

1:25:32.410 --> 1:25:34.992
- Ow!

1:25:36.130 --> 1:25:40.373
(dramatic music)

1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:47.421
- Virginia?

1:25:47.470 --> 1:25:49.381
Virginia?

1:25:49.770 --> 1:25:52.421
- Ow!

1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:55.438
Stop it, you're hurting me!

1:25:56.690 --> 1:25:58.351
Let go!

1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:00.891
Let go of me right now!

1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:03.851
Ow!

1:26:14.330 --> 1:26:16.286
- Ah!

1:26:16.330 --> 1:26:17.740
- What happened?

1:26:17.790 --> 1:26:20.497
- He's got Virginia,
that's what happened.

1:26:20.550 --> 1:26:21.619
- No!

1:26:21.670 --> 1:26:23.501
- Yes.

1:26:24.260 --> 1:26:25.796
- We'll never find her!

1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:26.750
- What?

1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:28.427
- It's all my fault.

1:26:28.470 --> 1:26:30.461
Oh, it's all my fault!

1:26:30.510 --> 1:26:31.716
(crying)

1:26:31.770 --> 1:26:34.056
(howling)

1:26:39.230 --> 1:26:44.190
(dramatic music)

1:26:49.410 --> 1:26:52.402
(knocking)

1:27:05.090 --> 1:27:08.002
(screaming)

1:27:08.050 --> 1:27:11.349
(dramatic music)

1:27:15.310 --> 1:27:20.430
I'm wishing on a star

1:27:21.820 --> 1:27:26.314
To follow where you are

1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:33.280
I'm wishing on a dream

1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:39.950
To follow what it means

1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:46.368
And I wish on all the rainbows

1:27:46.420 --> 1:27:48.502
That I've seen

1:27:48.550 --> 1:27:53.499
I wish on all the
people who really dream.

1:28:02.310 --> 1:28:05.279
I'm wishing on a star
