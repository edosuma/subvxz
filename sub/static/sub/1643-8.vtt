A guy named Lincoln Burrows.

we were up here cleaning out toxic mold.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.960

We'd never assign inmates to do that.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.385
Route 66 runs
directly beneath that building.

It's the only building
sitting on top of those tunnels.

02:18.305 --> 02:22.934
All we gotta do is get in there on Pl
and dig ourselves an on-ramp.

02:23.894 --> 02:27.773
Shortly after we hit the infirmary.
Then we'll be outside those walls.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.232
What's in there?

02:29.524 --> 02:33.445
It's an old storage room. I figure John here
can pull all the strings he needs.

That's a <i>restricted</i> area.</i>

I got to be able to justify it
to the bulls, you know.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.372
There's gotta be some actual work
to be done in there for me to get in there.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.666
- You follow?
- Then you better figure it out.

02:45.749 --> 02:49.670

we're not getting out of here.

I just happen to know quite a bit about.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.466
So the question is,

13:20.550 --> 13:23.928
why would Charles Westmoreland
be in Arizona boosting a car,

13:24.012 --> 13:25.722
<i>10 states away from where he lived,</i>

13:25.805 --> 13:28.224
<i>and only 10 miles away
from the Mexican border.</i>

13:28.308 --> 13:31.060
<i>And why, two days before that,
would someone</i>

13:31.144 --> 13:34.147
<i>make a phone call to his wife
from a motel in Portland,</i>

13:34.897 --> 13:38.234
<i>a stone's throw away from the airport
out of which, shortly after,</i>

13:38.735 --> 13:41.904
Flight 305 was hijacked
by one D.B. Cooper.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.407
Seven hours after the hijacking,

13:44.490 --> 13:47.577
records show Charles Westmoreland
was treated for a busted knee

13:47.660 --> 13:49.537
<i>at a free clinic in Brigham City.</i>

13:49.620 --> 13:53.583
Only way to get from Portland, Oregon,
to Brigham City, Utah in seven hours,

13:53.666 --> 13:54.667
<i>is in a car,</i>

13:55.293 --> 13:57.670
<i>breaking every land-speed record
known to man,</i>

13:58.212 --> 13:59.922
<i>or flying-</i>

14:00.006 --> 14:04.385
It's public record D.B. Cooperjumped
out of that 727 about an hour after takeoff.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.679
Taking a dive at 10,000 feet

14:06.763 --> 14:10.433
with $1.5 million in cash
and a hastily packed parachute

14:10.808 --> 14:13.269
might make for a pretty rough landing.

14:13.353 --> 14:17.023
Rough enough to shatter some bones.
Maybe even a left knee.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.694
D.B. Cooper would've had a car
waiting for him when he landed.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.197
According to D.M.V. records, in 1971,

14:24.280 --> 14:28.076
Charles Westmoreland
was the proud owner of a '65 Chevy Nova.

14:28.451 --> 14:32.997
As it happens, a '65 Chevy Nova
with the registration number scraped off

14:33.081 --> 14:36.250
<i>was found abandoned with a blown gasket
along the Arizona border</i>

14:37.418 --> 14:40.129
<i>a mile or two away from where
you accidentally hit that woman</i>

14:40.838 --> 14:42.423
with your stolen car.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.638
- Interesting story.
- Interesting man.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.851
- But you didn't answer one thing.
- What's that?

14:55.770 --> 14:59.524
Maybe I did hurt my knee,
I did steal that car,

15:00.233 --> 15:02.735
and I did accidentally hit that poor lady.

15:03.820 --> 15:08.157
But how could I have hijacked a plane
in Portland on November 24th,

15:08.491 --> 15:12.578
when I was in Folsom, finishing up
a 30-day drunk and disorderly?

15:17.625 --> 15:21.129
I hope you aren't hanging
this whole escape on that money,

15:21.212 --> 15:23.214
'cause I'm not the one in possession of it.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.762

15:50.366 --> 15:52.160
Veronica, come on.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.458
We're okay.

How is this okay, Nick?
Somebodyjust tried to kill us.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.047
- I know. I was there.
- Then act like it, okay?

16:05.131 --> 16:07.758
We just watched a man burn to death
right in front of us.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.429
My God.

16:13.598 --> 16:17.059
- Lukasz. My God.
- It's okay, it's okay.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.811
We just left him there.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.230
There was nothing we could do for him.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.774
He was dead
as soon as he opened the door.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.652
I am trying so hard
to understand all this, Nick.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.321
Who these people are, what they want.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.199
How we just walked away from there
without even calling the police.

16:31.282 --> 16:35.161
We did it because these people we're
dealing with won't stop until we're dead.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.205
Now, if they think we're dead,
like they do right now,

16:37.288 --> 16:38.581
maybe we get a little breathing room here.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.334
- Figure out what our next move is.
- No, we should go to the police.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.920
I've been telling myself the same thing.
But you know what?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.463
They're bigger than the police.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.469
Now, we go to the authorities,
and all we're gonna be doing is,

16:51.552 --> 16:53.262
broadcasting to them that we're still alive

16:53.346 --> 16:56.182
and then we got their target
right on our backs again.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.559
We can't hide forever.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.188
No, no, maybe not forever. But I...

17:02.730 --> 17:05.316
I think I know a place we can,
at least for a little while.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.615
We'll just have to go in there
ourselves then.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.451
Like I said, unless the old man's in,
it's not possible.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.286
And even if it were,
with the guards in there,

17:17.369 --> 17:20.580
there's no way in hell they're just
gonna sit back and watch us start a fire.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.000
See, I already figured that part out.
I've been thinking.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.294
And?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.213
That thing you're doing
at the Pope's office,

17:27.296 --> 17:29.090
-you're using rubber cement?
- Yeah.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.259
- Can you get some out of there?
- Maybe. Why?

17:31.342 --> 17:34.345
Look, there's a coffee maker
in the guards' room, right?

17:34.428 --> 17:37.306
I got a hook-up with one of my boys
in the kitchen.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.434
If we can get rubber cement
in the bottom of that coffee pot,

17:40.518 --> 17:42.562
when the burner goes on...

17:44.981 --> 17:46.607
It's a good idea.

17:46.941 --> 17:50.194
But without Westmoreland,
we're never getting in that room.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.863
- He doesn't want any part of the escape?
- No.

17:52.947 --> 17:56.200
Well, what does he want?
He's gotta want something.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.203
Everybody wants something.

18:07.295 --> 18:10.673

- You're welcome.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.363
- Where'd you find her?
- In the yard. By the chapel.

18:36.032 --> 18:40.036
Why do I get the feeling
there's a string attached to this?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.330
Not a string. Just a favor.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.378
- I'm not D.B. Cooper.
- That's all right.

18:50.463 --> 18:54.175
'Cause it's not gonna take D.B. Cooper
to do what I need done.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.676
What's that?

18:56.135 --> 18:57.678
All I want you to do

18:57.762 --> 19:01.474
is take a certain coffee pot
into the guard room at a certain time

19:01.557 --> 19:04.810
-and turn the burner on.
- Why?

19:05.311 --> 19:09.899
Let's just say it'd be in everyone's best
interest if a fire were to start in there.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.277
Marilyn, did you think
he was the arsonist type?

19:14.195 --> 19:17.281
I'm not. I'm the clean-up crew type.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.993
The type that gets access
to all kinds of tools.

19:23.204 --> 19:26.415

I want to be ready.

you owe me anything.
