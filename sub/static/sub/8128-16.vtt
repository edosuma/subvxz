                        Nah.    

01:01.194 --> 01:04.129
Gloria, you've turned down      
        over 50 movies.         

01:04.131 --> 01:06.330
    If you don't want to go,    
 just say so. I'll understand.  

01:06.332 --> 01:07.331
    I don't wanna go.           

01:07.333 --> 01:10.735
I don't understand you, Gloria. 

01:10.737 --> 01:12.603
I feel like doing               
something tonight.              

01:12.605 --> 01:15.140
  Oh, okay, then let me show you
    a new dance I learned.      

01:15.142 --> 01:16.174
              Ooh, you're gonna 
                love it.        

01:16.176 --> 01:18.576
                It's called     
            the elevator dance. 

01:18.578 --> 01:19.911
The elevator dance?             

01:19.913 --> 01:22.013
                 Yeah, no steps.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.915
 Gloria, take it easy,          
    will you?                   

01:23.917 --> 01:24.983
              What's the matter?

01:24.985 --> 01:27.118
 Y-y-you're hugging me          
    so tight.                   

01:27.120 --> 01:28.887
          That's because I like 
        being close to you.     

01:28.889 --> 01:31.222
    Close to me?                
  You're among me.              

01:32.524 --> 01:35.994
        Gloria, do you think    
            this is too dressy  

01:35.996 --> 01:37.896
             for Amelia's party?

01:37.898 --> 01:40.464
      Ma, you've had that dress 
            for four years      

01:40.466 --> 01:43.201
 and every time you put it on,  
 you ask me that same question. 

01:43.203 --> 01:46.137
  Well, I paid $28.50 for it,   

01:46.139 --> 01:50.474
 and I don't want them to think 
        I'm showing off.        

01:50.476 --> 01:51.576
                  It's fine, Ma.

01:51.578 --> 01:52.643
          Oh, is Amelia cooking 

01:52.645 --> 01:54.245
            another one of her  
          fancy dinners tonight 

01:54.247 --> 01:55.546
              for you and Daddy?

01:55.548 --> 01:57.048
        Oh, yeah.               

01:57.050 --> 02:01.119
 It's gonna be a seven-course,  
round-the-world gourmet dinner. 

02:01.121 --> 02:02.486
        Where's Archie?         

02:02.488 --> 02:05.090
In the kitchen,                 
making himself a sandwich.      

02:05.092 --> 02:06.390
                         Oh, no!

02:06.392 --> 02:08.392
            Archie!             

02:08.394 --> 02:10.895
     Archie. Oh, don't eat that!

02:10.896 --> 02:12.630
I'm eating it.                  

02:13.833 --> 02:15.233
                 Archie, please,

02:15.235 --> 02:17.268
             if you don't hurry,
                we'll be late.  

02:17.270 --> 02:18.269
Oh, no.                         

02:18.271 --> 02:20.404
We're going to see              
your relatives.                 

02:20.406 --> 02:22.073
We go to see                    
your relatives,                 

02:22.075 --> 02:23.574
no matter what time             
we get there,                   

02:23.576 --> 02:25.576
it'll be too soon.              

02:27.947 --> 02:29.114
                    Come on!    

02:29.116 --> 02:32.416
         We got a long ride     
    on the subway to the beach. 

02:32.418 --> 02:33.417
Oh, don't tell me.              

02:33.419 --> 02:34.919
Why would dumbbells like that   

02:34.921 --> 02:36.921
live at the beach               
in the wintertime?              

02:38.224 --> 02:41.559
              Maybe it's because
              Russ is a plumber,

02:41.561 --> 02:46.330
         and he likes to hear   
     the sound of water running.

02:55.107 --> 02:58.509
Well, when you see Russ, be sure
and shake your head, huh?       

02:58.511 --> 03:01.746
So he can hear the water        
on your brain.                  

03:03.015 --> 03:04.849
     No, really, we can't.      

03:04.851 --> 03:06.151
     But thanks for asking.     

03:06.153 --> 03:07.518
     Oh, have a good time.      

03:07.520 --> 03:08.887
    Yeah, bye, David.           

03:08.889 --> 03:11.455
                  Uh, what was  
                all that about? 

03:11.457 --> 03:13.124
Oh, that was just David         
inviting us                     

03:13.126 --> 03:14.659
to a party                      
he's having tonight.            

03:14.661 --> 03:16.460
      You turned him down?      
     Why didn't you ask me?     

03:16.462 --> 03:17.896
    Why? You wanna go?          

03:17.898 --> 03:20.165
Well, Gloria, I said I felt like
    doing something tonight.    

03:20.167 --> 03:22.233
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.           

03:22.235 --> 03:24.335
      It's just, well, the folks
    are gonna be out tonight,   

03:24.337 --> 03:25.937
        and I sort of took it   
                for granted     

03:25.939 --> 03:27.305
        you'd wanna stay home   
                  with me.      

03:27.307 --> 03:28.973
    Yeah, well,                 
    lately you've been          

03:28.975 --> 03:30.374
taking a lot of things          
     for granted.               

03:30.376 --> 03:32.677
                Oh, Michael,    
            don't be like that. 

03:32.679 --> 03:33.978
              Come on!          
Yeah, all right.                

03:33.980 --> 03:36.948
Oh, look at this!               

03:36.950 --> 03:39.583
He's got her on his lap already.

03:39.585 --> 03:43.955
      He'll be turning our home 
        into a massage parlor.  

03:43.957 --> 03:45.924
Archie, is that                 
all you think we do             

03:45.926 --> 03:47.125
when you're                     
out of the house?               

03:47.127 --> 03:48.459
                  Oh, no.       

03:48.461 --> 03:51.662
     I think you do it sometimes
        when I'm in the house.  

03:53.699 --> 03:55.499
                  EDITH: Archie,
                  we better go. 

03:55.501 --> 03:57.435
            Yeah, all right.    
        I'm coming, I'm coming. 

03:57.437 --> 03:58.502
Archie, for your information,   

03:58.504 --> 04:00.972
what Gloria and I do            
behind closed doors             

04:00.974 --> 04:02.040
is none of your business.       

04:02.042 --> 04:03.641
There's no reason               
for you to snigger.             

04:03.643 --> 04:06.211
          What was that I heard 
                from you,       

04:06.213 --> 04:07.979
          you big pinko liberal?

04:07.981 --> 04:12.416
Don't you know that the delicate
word for that is "Snegro"?      

04:15.020 --> 04:17.889
Bye, Ma. Have a good time.      
                     EDITH: Bye!

04:17.891 --> 04:20.624
  Whoop-dee-doo, they're gone.  

04:20.625 --> 04:22.393
              I was showing you 
             the elevator dance.

04:22.395 --> 04:23.928
    Elevator going up!          

04:23.930 --> 04:26.064
     Hey, hey, Gloria!          
    Take it easy.               

04:26.066 --> 04:27.465
     My back, my back.          
        Ow, ow, ow.             

04:27.467 --> 04:29.467
    Michael, you used to love it
          when I did this.      

04:29.469 --> 04:31.002
      I-I-I still do.           

04:31.004 --> 04:32.636
        It's just               
I wasn't set for it.            

04:32.638 --> 04:34.138
              I know what it is.

04:34.140 --> 04:35.573
             It's David's party.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.575
     You're mad I turned it down
      without asking you first. 

04:37.577 --> 04:38.943
                     Is that it?

04:38.945 --> 04:41.880
Well, our marriage is an equal  
partnership, fifty-fifty, right?

04:41.882 --> 04:43.248
        I'll call David back.   

04:43.250 --> 04:44.815
                 No, no, no.    
              That's all right. 

04:44.817 --> 04:46.717
             You don't have to. 
              I made my point.  

04:46.719 --> 04:48.486
            You understand      
            that you were wrong,

04:48.488 --> 04:50.255
             and I understand   
        that you were wrong.    

04:50.257 --> 04:51.856
          See, that's the beauty
        of our relationship.    

04:51.858 --> 04:53.258
                We both have    
                an open mind.   

04:53.260 --> 04:56.194
                 Now, uh,       
          what'll it be tonight,

04:56.196 --> 04:57.195
watch a little television, huh? 

04:57.197 --> 04:59.430
No, honey,                      
we don't need television.       

04:59.432 --> 05:01.366
Let's talk.                     

05:01.368 --> 05:03.667
                All right, talk.

05:03.669 --> 05:05.403
            What do you want    
                to talk about?  

05:05.405 --> 05:07.338
You said I have                 
an open mind.                   

05:07.340 --> 05:10.775
Is that what first attracted you
to me, my mind?                 

05:10.777 --> 05:13.677
        No, as a matter of fact,
          it was your pockets.  

05:13.679 --> 05:14.678
      What?                     

05:14.680 --> 05:16.414
                  The first time
                    I saw you,  

05:16.416 --> 05:18.082
            you were wearing    
            those tight jeans   

05:18.084 --> 05:20.318
          with the cute little  
    pink pockets in the back.   

05:20.320 --> 05:24.389
      Those were the best       
 walking-away pants I ever saw. 

05:24.391 --> 05:26.190
                  I fell in love

05:26.192 --> 05:30.295
  with the way those cute little
     pink pockets walked away.  

05:30.297 --> 05:32.330
  Yeah? Yeah?                   

05:32.332 --> 05:33.431
                Then when you   
                  turned around,

05:33.433 --> 05:35.233
            I fell in love      
        with the rest of you.   

05:35.235 --> 05:37.936
          Oh, Michael.          

05:37.938 --> 05:39.103
When you started to speak,      

05:39.105 --> 05:40.305
    you almost ruined           
        the whole thing.        

05:40.307 --> 05:42.173
                  I'm kidding.  
            Kidding. Kidding.   

05:42.175 --> 05:43.607
                         Gloria,

05:43.609 --> 05:45.209
     I knew the first time      
        I saw you               

05:45.211 --> 05:46.877
      that underneath that      
Little Orphan Annie hairdo      

05:46.879 --> 05:48.079
        you used to wear        

05:48.081 --> 05:49.414
      there lurked a mind.      

05:49.416 --> 05:52.083
And I knew that                 
underneath all that hair        

05:52.085 --> 05:53.418
and the mustache                

05:53.420 --> 05:54.819
and that beard you used to wear,

05:54.821 --> 05:55.987
            there lurked a face,

05:55.989 --> 05:58.323
            a beautiful face,   

05:58.325 --> 05:59.324
    which I'm taking with me.   

05:59.326 --> 06:00.591
                Uh, where?      
        Where are you going?    

06:00.593 --> 06:01.692
  Upstairs.                     

06:01.694 --> 06:03.094
             We were having such
            a nice conversation.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.495
                Why do you      
                want to end it? 

06:04.497 --> 06:06.097
Who's ending it?                
We'll talk on the way.          

06:06.099 --> 06:07.665
              I forgot what     
        I was talking about.    

06:07.667 --> 06:09.300
     You broke my concentration.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.734
                I lost my whole 
            trend of thought.   

06:10.736 --> 06:12.870
        You wanna play checkers?

06:12.872 --> 06:14.705
Checkers? Won't that break      
your trend of thought?          

06:14.707 --> 06:15.806
                     No, no, no.

06:15.808 --> 06:17.708
         See, I play much better
              when I think.     

06:17.710 --> 06:18.943
      I think and I play better.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.744
You just sit over there,        
 I'll get the checkers.         

06:20.746 --> 06:22.146
                  I don't want  
            to play checkers.   

06:22.148 --> 06:24.148
All right, forget checkers.     
You don't want to play checkers?

06:24.150 --> 06:25.749
You're the one                  
who wants to stay home.         

06:25.751 --> 06:26.650
What do you wanna do?           

06:29.888 --> 06:31.990
  Quit kidding around, Gloria.  

06:31.992 --> 06:34.892
         Who's kidding?         

06:36.862 --> 06:38.129
We'll watch television.         

06:38.131 --> 06:40.631
      No, honey, come on.       

06:40.633 --> 06:42.967
     Let's make

07:25.111 --> 07:27.045
        No.                     

07:28.280 --> 07:29.813
                 Michael,       
            what's the matter?  

07:29.815 --> 07:31.282
      Nothing the matter.       

07:31.284 --> 07:32.683
     I just don't feel like     
        going upstairs.         

07:32.685 --> 07:35.286
          You haven't felt like 
              going upstairs    

07:35.288 --> 07:36.987
        for the last four weeks.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.856
             I don't understand.
             Is something wrong?

07:38.858 --> 07:40.391
          Gloria,               
there's nothing wrong.          

07:40.393 --> 07:43.394
I just-- I've had a lot of      
important things on my mind.    

07:43.396 --> 07:44.862
                Like what?      

07:44.864 --> 07:47.532
Well, like, uh,                 
for instance, uh...             

07:47.534 --> 07:49.033
the energy crisis.              

07:49.035 --> 07:50.134
                             Oh!

07:50.136 --> 07:51.436
            Well, then I get it.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.404
          It's not that you're  
        being indifferent to me,

07:53.406 --> 07:55.005
    you're just being patriotic.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.441
What are you talking about?     

07:56.443 --> 07:58.742
    You're conserving energy.   

07:58.744 --> 08:01.045
Look, Gloria,                   
you don't understand.           

08:01.047 --> 08:02.646
                  You bet       
            I don't understand. 

08:02.648 --> 08:04.014
        You've been acting      
        really strange tonight. 

08:04.016 --> 08:06.417
    I used to run and jump      
and throw my legs around you,   

08:06.419 --> 08:07.552
            and you loved it.   

08:07.554 --> 08:09.153
             Tonight it was,    
         "Look out for my back."

08:09.155 --> 08:10.588
You always                      
used to wait for me.            

08:10.590 --> 08:12.723
You never jumped until I said,  
"Ready, set, go."               

08:12.725 --> 08:14.358
                        Oh!     

08:14.360 --> 08:16.760
     So that's what was missing,
          "Ready, set, go."     

08:16.762 --> 08:18.229
                 I can't jump   
            until you speak.    

08:18.231 --> 08:19.597
                  What are you, 
                my trainer?     

08:19.599 --> 08:22.800
No! I'm your husband            
and you're my wife.             

08:22.802 --> 08:24.735
And to be perfectly honest      
with you, Gloria,               

08:24.737 --> 08:27.972
lately you have been coming on  
a little bit too strong.        

08:27.974 --> 08:30.241
                 Oh, so now     
            it's all coming out!

08:30.243 --> 08:32.775
    Well, go ahead, Michael!    
      Get it all off your chest.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.778
All right, you asked for it.    
You're gonna get it.            

08:34.780 --> 08:36.380
For the last--                  
I don't know how long.          

08:36.381 --> 08:38.182
You say it's four weeks?        
All right, four weeks.          

08:38.183 --> 08:39.250
I think it's longer.            

08:39.251 --> 08:41.251
But we are hardly in bed        
with the lights off             

08:41.254 --> 08:42.986
and...there you are.            

08:44.123 --> 08:46.224
        What is wrong with that?

08:46.226 --> 08:50.194
Did you ever stop to think      
that maybe I'm not in the mood? 

08:54.766 --> 08:56.400
    How am I supposed to know   

08:56.402 --> 08:58.202
                whether or not  
             you're in the mood?

08:58.204 --> 09:00.738
You'll know when                
I make the advances.            

09:00.740 --> 09:01.939
That's how you'll know!         

09:01.941 --> 09:04.108
            I don't believe     
             that's you talking!

09:04.110 --> 09:05.176
Believe it, Gloria,             
because lately,                 

09:05.178 --> 09:06.977
I don't know who the man is     
around here.                    

09:06.979 --> 09:08.146
     What?                      

09:08.148 --> 09:09.647
          And I'm gonna tell you
              something else.   

09:09.649 --> 09:10.648
    For the last four weeks--   

09:10.650 --> 09:12.350
        And I think it's longer.

09:12.352 --> 09:17.188
      Some of those times,      
I didn't really have a headache.

09:22.161 --> 09:24.428
      Then why didn't you       
     just tell me the truth     

09:24.430 --> 09:26.830
      instead of making up      
      such a cheap excuse?      

09:26.832 --> 09:29.333
     Because I didn't want      
     to hurt your feelings.     

09:29.335 --> 09:31.769
    Well, what do you think     
    you're doing right now?     

09:35.106 --> 09:37.608
Michael, honey,                 
don't you understand?           

09:37.610 --> 09:39.910
If two people really            
love each other,                

09:39.912 --> 09:41.812
what's the difference           
who makes the first move?       

09:41.814 --> 09:43.581
            A big difference!   

09:43.583 --> 09:44.982
            The man doesn't like
                to be chased.   

09:44.984 --> 09:46.917
        It's more natural       
      for him to be the pursuer.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.352
Hold it! Hold everything.       

09:48.354 --> 09:52.190
Didn't you just say we had an   
equal partnership, fifty-fifty? 

09:52.192 --> 09:54.091
              Yeah. Yeah.       
      Everything is fifty-fifty.

09:54.093 --> 09:58.062
        But I'm the fifty       
that should be heard from first!

09:58.064 --> 10:02.900
That is typical                 
male-superiority garbage!       

10:02.902 --> 10:04.768
    Hey, hey, Gloria!           
                         No, no!

10:04.770 --> 10:07.004
        If we are equal, we are 
      equal partners everywhere,

10:07.006 --> 10:08.138
            and that includes   
                  the bedroom.  

10:09.308 --> 10:11.875
Don't you see that              
goes against nature?            

10:11.877 --> 10:13.844
I mean, take                    
the animal kingdom.             

10:13.846 --> 10:15.613
The male                        
is always in charge.            

10:15.615 --> 10:18.482
          Oh, yeah? Did you ever
            hear of a king bee? 

10:25.424 --> 10:26.490
             What?              

10:26.492 --> 10:28.959
        It's the female         
    who runs the hive.          

10:28.961 --> 10:31.895
        That is strictly        
     for breeding purposes.     

10:31.897 --> 10:33.797
     Okay, then what about      
    the black widow spider?     

10:33.799 --> 10:36.066
She does all the chasing.       
She decides on the mating.      

10:36.068 --> 10:39.270
 Yeah, and when she's finished  
with her husband, she kills him.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.740
      You see what happens      
when a woman takes charge?      

10:42.742 --> 10:46.009
Gloria, that is the whole point 
of our civilization.            

10:46.011 --> 10:49.413
Look how far we've come         
from the spiders!               

10:49.415 --> 10:50.481
             I don't believe it.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.882
          We got the whole house
            to ourselves,       

10:51.884 --> 10:53.117
            and we're talking   
                 about spiders! 

10:53.119 --> 10:55.185
         Gloria, look,          
    all I'm trying to say--     

10:55.187 --> 11:00.157
 All I'm trying to say is that a
 man's sex drives are different!

11:00.159 --> 11:01.759
Oh, don't tell me               
about your drives, Michael.     

11:01.761 --> 11:03.160
Mine are just                   
as strong as yours.             

11:03.162 --> 11:06.830
And if it gives me pleasure once
in a while to be the pursuer,   

11:06.832 --> 11:08.866
the least you can do            
is deliver.                     

11:14.773 --> 11:16.774
        Wait just a second here.

11:16.776 --> 11:17.908
             Wait just a second!

11:17.910 --> 11:19.510
I have not finished.            

11:19.512 --> 11:21.646
Now, you call yourself          
progressive.                    

11:21.648 --> 11:22.846
But when it comes to women,     

11:22.848 --> 11:25.082
you're still working            
on the old double standard.     

11:25.084 --> 11:29.253
If a man comes on strong,       
he's a great lover, a Casanova, 

11:29.255 --> 11:31.855
but if it's a woman,            
she's a nymphomaniac.           

11:31.857 --> 11:34.158
                 Look, Gloria...

11:34.160 --> 11:37.461
            A good marriage     
      is based on give and take.

11:37.463 --> 11:38.929
      Take tonight, for example.

 I had a very unusual experience

to you in there.                

17:05.925 --> 17:07.790
    I heard everything you said.

17:07.792 --> 17:09.993
            You had a very      
     unusual experience tonight.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.060
                    Go ahead.   

17:11.063 --> 17:13.230
             Yeah.              

17:13.232 --> 17:15.365
        Well, I went to         
     David's party tonight.     

17:16.601 --> 17:18.535
              I was feeling     
              very depressed    

17:18.537 --> 17:20.270
                about you       
              walking out on me.

17:20.271 --> 17:21.839
                There were      
          a lot of people there,

17:21.840 --> 17:23.306
         all having a good time.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.308
             I sat all by myself
                 in a corner,   

17:25.310 --> 17:27.044
                just staring off
                into space.     

17:27.046 --> 17:30.781
    And then suddenly           
    I heard this soft voice,    

17:30.783 --> 17:34.284
    saying, "Would you care     
         for a drink?"          

17:34.286 --> 17:35.819
                    I looked up.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.788
      And there, standing       
        in front of me,         

17:37.790 --> 17:40.423
     was a beautiful girl.      

17:40.425 --> 17:44.327
     I don't mean cutie-pie     
  beautiful. I mean beautiful.  

17:44.329 --> 17:46.830
             She had black hair.

17:46.832 --> 17:49.633
  It was parted right down the  
middle and pulled straight back.

17:49.635 --> 17:52.302
      She looked just like      
          a ballerina.          

17:52.304 --> 17:56.874
With a name to go with it.      
            Felicia.            

17:56.876 --> 17:59.843
How's that for a name, huh?     
             Felicia.           

17:59.845 --> 18:01.478
     It's a beautiful name.     

18:01.480 --> 18:03.246
                 You betcha.    
             Beautiful. Felicia!

18:03.248 --> 18:04.548
            Yeah.               

18:04.550 --> 18:07.785
             Well, naturally,   
         I did the polite thing.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.820
        I asked her to sit down.

18:10.989 --> 18:12.056
          You know what she did?

18:13.658 --> 18:15.092
She sat down.                   

18:15.094 --> 18:17.360
                  That's exactly
                what she did.   

18:17.362 --> 18:19.596
                But do you know 
            how she sat down?   

18:19.598 --> 18:21.865
              Right on the floor
                  at my feet.   

18:21.867 --> 18:24.668
Dogs do that a lot too.         

18:26.604 --> 18:28.638
        All right, Gloria.      
    You make fun if you want.   

18:28.640 --> 18:30.941
            But I'm telling you 
          that it was beautiful.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.642
                I don't know how
                 to explain it, 

18:32.644 --> 18:35.112
         but there was instant  
    communication between us.   

18:35.114 --> 18:37.647
Oh, I can explain it.           
You talked and she listened.    

18:37.649 --> 18:39.817
        I knew this was going to
            be rough on you.    

18:39.819 --> 18:41.251
                  I'm about to  
            tell you, though,   

18:41.253 --> 18:45.055
  there's more to this story.   

18:47.092 --> 18:48.692
I took her home.                

18:48.694 --> 18:50.994
Uh, uh! Just let me             
finish the story, please.       

18:50.996 --> 18:52.395
        Don't interrupt.        

18:53.798 --> 18:57.334
    I took her to her place,    
stood out there on the sidewalk.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.002
It was a beautiful moment,      
            Gloria.             

18:59.004 --> 19:01.338
      Just the two of us,       
looking into each other's eyes. 

19:01.340 --> 19:03.006
And she waited,                 

19:03.008 --> 19:04.641
        without asking--        

19:04.643 --> 19:06.043
          You hear me?          
          You hear me?          

19:06.045 --> 19:07.611
        Without asking,         

19:07.613 --> 19:10.680
    she waited for me           
     to make the decision.      

19:11.983 --> 19:17.121
So I took her in my arms        
and I kissed her.               

19:17.123 --> 19:18.521
    I want to tell you          
    something, Gloria.          

19:18.523 --> 19:20.190
                No, I want to   
             tell you something.

19:20.192 --> 19:21.591
You just let me                 
finish here!                    

19:21.593 --> 19:24.594
I want to tell you that for     
the first time in four weeks--  

19:24.596 --> 19:26.696
And I think it's longer.        

19:27.866 --> 19:31.201
I enjoyed a true                
man-woman relationship.         

19:31.203 --> 19:32.435
                Well, I am glad.

19:32.437 --> 19:35.239
Because it makes it a lot easier
    for me to tell you          

19:35.241 --> 19:36.940
              that I met someone
                 tonight too.   

19:36.942 --> 19:37.975
     Huh?                       

19:37.977 --> 19:40.410
                 Someone I was  
              very attracted to.

19:40.412 --> 19:42.512
        Huh?                    

19:42.514 --> 19:43.914
                  When I left   
              the house tonight,

19:43.916 --> 19:46.950
    I walked for a long time,   
         and I got really cold. 

19:46.952 --> 19:48.685
                So I stopped    
            for a cup of coffee.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.154
     I was very angry and upset,

19:50.156 --> 19:52.389
      and I wasn't paying any   
  attention to what I was doing.

19:52.391 --> 19:54.191
         And I spilled my coffee
             all over my lap.   

19:54.193 --> 19:56.326
Yeah, well, forget the coffee.  
What about the man?             

19:56.328 --> 19:59.096
      Well, he was sitting      
right next to me at the counter.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.498
And when I spilled my coffee,   
    he took out his handkerchief

20:01.500 --> 20:03.100
                and dipped it   
             in a glass of water

20:03.102 --> 20:05.035
            and started to clean
        the stain off my lap.   

20:05.037 --> 20:06.536
Off your lap?                   

20:07.972 --> 20:10.707
     Yeah, and then he bought me
        another cup of coffee,  

20:10.709 --> 20:12.810
          and we sat in a booth,
              and we talked.    

20:12.812 --> 20:15.112
You moved to a booth?           

20:15.114 --> 20:16.246
                        Yeah.   

20:16.248 --> 20:19.516
With a complete stranger,       
you moved to a booth?           

20:19.518 --> 20:22.219
    That's just it, Michael. It 
  wasn't like he was a stranger.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.087
                He was such     
                a good listener.

20:24.089 --> 20:27.057
          He had an instinctive 
         understanding of women.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.192
        He was very intelligent.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.460
 You know what he said about us?
        What?                   

20:30.462 --> 20:33.263
                Well, he said   
                that most men   

20:33.265 --> 20:35.232
             are rather vain    
        about their masculinity,

20:35.234 --> 20:38.335
    and that my husband might be
        feeling threatened--    

20:38.337 --> 20:40.437
    Forget that, forget that!   
      I don't care what he said.

20:40.439 --> 20:41.839
No, I think                     
it's important                  

20:41.841 --> 20:43.974
that I tell you                 
everything that happened.       

20:43.976 --> 20:45.508
                There's more?   

20:46.644 --> 20:47.811
    Yes.                        

20:47.813 --> 20:50.047
When we left                    
the coffee shop,                

20:50.049 --> 20:53.383
he insisted on walking me       
to the bus stop.                

20:53.385 --> 20:55.452
We stood on the corner          
saying goodbye.                 

20:55.454 --> 20:57.888
                    And he made 
                  a pass at you.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.289
No, it wasn't                   
like that at all.               

20:59.291 --> 21:01.725
No, it was one of               
the most beautiful moments      

21:01.727 --> 21:04.194
I've ever experienced.          

21:04.196 --> 21:07.797
He stood there waiting,         
a real man,                     

21:07.799 --> 21:12.569
secure in his own masculinity,  
aware of what my needs might be,

21:12.571 --> 21:15.873
and perfectly willing           
to let me make the first move.  

21:15.875 --> 21:17.207
And you know what I did?        

21:17.209 --> 21:20.944
    You made the first move.    

21:22.213 --> 21:24.014
         You bet I did.         

21:24.016 --> 21:26.183
    You made the first move!    

21:26.185 --> 21:28.151
I threw my arms around him      
        and kissed him.         

21:28.153 --> 21:32.322
You-- You kissed a perfect      
  stranger on a street corner?  

21:32.324 --> 21:34.992
     No, right on the lips.     

21:38.296 --> 21:40.597
    You kissed him on the lips?!

21:40.599 --> 21:41.999
Michael, it wasn't              
because I loved him--           

21:42.001 --> 21:44.001
        No, no, no, no!         
  You kissed him on the lips.   

21:44.003 --> 21:45.402
You kissed him on the lips.     

21:45.404 --> 21:46.469
                 Michael Stivic!

21:46.471 --> 21:47.804
                    I listened  
                  to your story.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.373
Yeah, but that's                
just it, Gloria.                

21:49.375 --> 21:50.774
That's just what                
mine was, a story.              

21:50.776 --> 21:51.942
It didn't really happen.        

21:51.944 --> 21:53.343
I didn't go to                  
David's party tonight.          

21:53.345 --> 21:55.145
You wanna know the truth,       
where I really went?            

21:55.147 --> 21:56.914
You wanna know                  
what really happened            

21:56.916 --> 21:58.815
while you were standing         
on a street corner              

21:58.817 --> 22:01.418
throwing yourself               
at some strange man's lips?     

22:01.420 --> 22:04.187
I was sitting all alone         

22:04.189 --> 22:07.324
in a lousy, crummy              
neighborhood movie theater      

22:07.326 --> 22:09.826
watching a rotten               
double feature.                 

22:09.828 --> 22:12.329
     You might have enjoyed it  
if you'd stayed in your seat.   

22:12.331 --> 22:15.265
                 Five trips to  
              the candy counter.

22:24.542 --> 22:27.811
How do you know how many trips  
I made to the candy counter?    

22:27.813 --> 22:30.347
              Because I was     
         in that crummy theater,

22:30.349 --> 22:33.417
            sitting four rows   
        behind you, munch-mouth.

22:35.286 --> 22:38.521
Then that whole story about     
the man with the coffee stain,  

22:38.523 --> 22:40.324
the kiss on the lips,           
you made that up?               

22:40.326 --> 22:43.360
     That's right, Michael,     
just like you made up your story

22:43.362 --> 22:47.497
about your girlfriend, Felicia. 

22:47.499 --> 22:49.232
     It's a beautiful name.     

22:54.638 --> 22:58.342
    Michel, I made up that story
             to show you        

22:58.344 --> 23:00.377
                  that if I'm   
            attracted to you,   

23:00.379 --> 23:03.213
        what's wrong with me    
          letting you know that?

23:03.215 --> 23:05.782
                          Honey.

23:05.784 --> 23:08.518
              If two people     
         really love each other,

23:08.520 --> 23:10.854
            it doesn't matter   
            who starts things   

23:10.856 --> 23:12.589
                as long as      
            they get started,   

23:12.591 --> 23:15.425
                and as long as  
             we end up together.

23:15.427 --> 23:17.494
        Doesn't that make sense?

23:19.930 --> 23:21.098
      Yeah.                     

23:21.100 --> 23:23.066
                    Good.       

23:24.202 --> 23:25.969
        Oh, Michael, mustard.   

23:25.971 --> 23:26.870
Oh.                             

23:32.276 --> 23:34.044
It was delicious.               

23:35.179 --> 23:37.747
    Gloria, if you...           

23:37.749 --> 23:40.683
        still wanna play        
     ready, set, go, I'm...     

23:42.320 --> 23:43.186
          I'm willing.          

23:44.389 --> 23:45.855
         Whoop-dee-doo.         

23:47.558 --> 23:48.658
Ready, set--                    

23:48.660 --> 23:50.060
            Hold it, hold it,   
            hold it, Michael.   

23:50.062 --> 23:52.029
                Fifty-fifty.    

23:52.031 --> 23:55.598
  You're right, you're right.   
         You go first.          

23:55.600 --> 23:56.699
                 Ready.         

23:56.701 --> 23:58.001
              Set.              

23:58.003 --> 24:00.370
        BOTH: Go!               

24:16.820 --> 24:18.855
What did I tell you, huh?       

24:18.857 --> 24:21.525
 They've been at it             
since we left.                  

24:36.006 --> 24:37.541
MICHAEL: Ready.                 
                    GLORIA: Set.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.008
        BOTH: Go!               

24:47.552 --> 24:50.454
         Did you hear that?     
    They're calling signals now.

25:08.839 --> 25:12.842
