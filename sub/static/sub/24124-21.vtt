WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:03.166
I gotta get goin'

00:03.166 --> 00:06.583
a friend of mine

00:08.333 --> 00:11.291
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.958 --> 00:17.375
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.375 --> 00:20.833
I know he's out there

00:24.583 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.375
and again

00:31.375 --> 00:34.875
and there's nobody home

00:34.875 --> 00:38.333
to count on a friend

00:38.333 --> 00:41.875
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.375
take me, please?

00:45.375 --> 00:48.750
I gotta be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.333
Winnie the Pooh

01:11.833 --> 01:12.875
Gopher: Come on.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.583
Whoa. Say--

01:18.583 --> 01:19.875
Got me a big one.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.000
My turn.

01:25.125 --> 01:28.250
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Around and round
the Piglet goes,

01:28.250 --> 01:30.958
where he stops,
only Tigger knows.

01:32.416 --> 01:33.458
You're gettin' warmer.

01:33.458 --> 01:35.375
Warmer.

01:35.375 --> 01:37.583
Nah,
you're gettin' colder.
You're gettin' warmer.

01:37.583 --> 01:41.000
Looks like fun.
Wish I could have some.

01:42.708 --> 01:46.583
Hey, buddy burro,
whatcha doin' outside?

01:46.583 --> 01:49.875
Don't want to ruin
everyone's good time.

01:49.875 --> 01:51.875
That's ridickerous.

01:51.875 --> 01:54.125
Eeyore,
the party's for you.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.708
What's a Pin the Tail
on the Donkey party, uh,

01:56.708 --> 01:58.125
without a donkey?

01:58.125 --> 02:01.583
No, party's are for
popular animals,

02:01.583 --> 02:03.125
like Tiggers.

02:03.125 --> 02:06.500
Look, being popular
is easy.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.416
You just gotta me like me.

02:09.416 --> 02:11.416
Rule number one:

02:11.416 --> 02:14.625
Simply walk up to someone
and say, "Hello!"

02:15.958 --> 02:19.166
Now get in there
and have some fun.

02:19.166 --> 02:22.583
Think I've had
enough fun for one day.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.000
Better go now.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.458
Uh, uh,
but you just got here.

02:26.458 --> 02:28.833
Forgot what to say.

02:30.291 --> 02:31.416
Hello.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.333
Hello.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.625
Why, hello, Eeyore.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.583
Hello.

02:40.583 --> 02:42.750
Uh, hello, Eeyore.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.625
Hi there, sonny.

02:44.625 --> 02:46.458
Glad you came.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.083
It's, uh, your turn next.

02:49.083 --> 02:50.583
Hello.

02:50.583 --> 02:53.875
Yeah,
you said that already.

02:53.875 --> 02:59.291
Hello. Hello.
Hello. Hello.

02:59.291 --> 03:02.625
Mm, must have
slipped a groove.

03:02.625 --> 03:05.583
Hello. Hello.

03:05.583 --> 03:08.125
Can he do more than
say hello?

03:08.125 --> 03:11.375
Hell-ohhh!

03:11.375 --> 03:15.458
Yeah, he can say hello
with enthusiasm.

03:15.458 --> 03:17.000
Hello.

03:21.458 --> 03:22.875
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

03:22.875 --> 03:26.000
Uh, whatcha doin',
buddy boy?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Waitin' to say hello.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.250
Think I'm gettin'
the hang of it.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.958
Hello.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.375
Boy, that's terrifical.

03:37.375 --> 03:40.250
Uh, hate to tell ya,
but the party was over
last night.

03:40.250 --> 03:42.166
It figures.

03:42.166 --> 03:43.708
Might as well go home.

03:43.708 --> 03:45.000
Now, wait a minute.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.708
If you're really
gonna be like me,

03:46.708 --> 03:49.208
you gotta do more than
just say hello.

03:49.208 --> 03:52.000
Rule two:
You gotta learn to...

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
smile.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.083
Why, hello, Eeyore.

04:01.083 --> 04:04.458
My, you certainly look,
uh...

04:04.458 --> 04:06.750
happy today.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.333
- That was great,
buddy boy.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.958
See?
Your public loves ya.

04:12.958 --> 04:16.000
Thanks, Tigger.
Couldn't have done it
without ya.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.250
Oh, bein' popular
is easy for Tiggers.

04:19.250 --> 04:23.000
All I gotta do is be me.
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

04:23.000 --> 04:27.125
Rule three:
Just gotta be Tigger.

04:32.458 --> 04:34.416
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.416
Hi ya, buddy boy.

04:38.416 --> 04:39.750
Hello, Tigger.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.250
Tigger?

04:41.250 --> 04:43.875
- Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.
- Oh, d-d-d-dear.

04:46.958 --> 04:49.000
What in the world?

04:50.750 --> 04:53.166
Hi ya, fluffy bottom.

04:53.166 --> 04:54.291
Oh, Tigger,

04:54.291 --> 04:56.000
can't you ever
make an entrance

04:56.000 --> 04:58.416
without bouncing on the--

04:58.416 --> 05:00.708
You're not Tigger.

05:00.708 --> 05:03.500
No. I'm Eeyore.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.333
Aren't I popular?

05:05.333 --> 05:08.708
But you bounced me.

05:08.708 --> 05:12.416
That's what us Eeyores
do best.

05:12.416 --> 05:14.833
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

05:14.833 --> 05:18.333
Oh, no. Oh my!
Not two of them!

05:19.166 --> 05:21.833
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

05:21.833 --> 05:24.625
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.250
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.625
Whoo-whoo-whoo--

05:29.625 --> 05:31.625
Hi ya, buddy bear.

05:31.625 --> 05:32.708
Hello, Tigger.

05:34.583 --> 05:36.708
I could be confused,

05:36.708 --> 05:40.750
but is there
something about you
that's different?

05:40.750 --> 05:42.875
- Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.
- Oh, bother.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.375
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

05:44.375 --> 05:46.583
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

05:48.291 --> 05:49.750
Hey, what's the big idea?

05:49.750 --> 05:53.208
I'm the guy
who bounces people.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.958
Just tryin' to be
more popular.

05:55.958 --> 05:58.458
Oh, yeah?
Well, don't do it
on top of me.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.875
Besides, if you're gonna
go around bouncin',

06:00.875 --> 06:02.333
you gotta do it right.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.375
I mean,
what you need is, uh--

06:04.375 --> 06:07.625
uh, speed and grace.
Yeah, yeah.

06:07.625 --> 06:09.333
Uh, like me.

06:09.333 --> 06:10.750
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:10.750 --> 06:12.958
Speed and grace.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.583
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

06:20.000 --> 06:23.416
Whoo-whoo-whooooo!

06:26.416 --> 06:28.833
Don't worry, Eeyore,
I gotcha!

06:28.833 --> 06:31.416
Yahhh!

06:31.416 --> 06:34.250
Ya-ha-ee-ahh!

06:34.250 --> 06:36.083
Runaway donkey!

06:37.333 --> 06:40.000
What's all the racket?

06:41.416 --> 06:43.375
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

06:46.375 --> 06:48.250
Uh, did you hear that,
Pooh?

06:51.375 --> 06:54.708
What? The noise
or you saying,

06:54.708 --> 06:56.250
"Did you hear that,
Pooh?"

06:58.250 --> 07:00.500
Ooh, ooh, ya-hay!

07:01.500 --> 07:03.833
No.

07:16.416 --> 07:19.416
Eeyore.
Look what you've done!

07:19.416 --> 07:22.125
Well, what have you
to say for yourself?

07:22.125 --> 07:24.250
TTFN.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.458
Ta-ta for now.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.250
I can't understand this.

07:29.250 --> 07:32.375
Eeyore thinking
he's a Tigger!

07:32.375 --> 07:34.833
This is probably
all your fault.

07:34.833 --> 07:35.875
Yeah, but--

07:35.875 --> 07:37.708
Look on the bright side.

07:37.708 --> 07:40.708
You've made Eeyore
even bouncier than you.

07:40.708 --> 07:42.708
Bouncier than me?

07:42.708 --> 07:45.583
I've created
a donkey monster.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.208
Eeyore:
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.750
Hey, buddy bear.

07:51.750 --> 07:54.458
Wanna play with me?

07:54.458 --> 07:57.000
Uh, no, thank you, Eeyore.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.958
Every time we play,

07:58.958 --> 08:01.583
I wind up
getting trounced.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.833
Eeyore:
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

08:04.833 --> 08:07.125
Uh, it's--

08:07.125 --> 08:08.166
Eeyore.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.625
Eeyore:
Hey, fluffy bottom,
wanna play?

08:12.625 --> 08:14.125
No, oh, no!

08:28.875 --> 08:31.166
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.333
Yike!

08:33.500 --> 08:37.750
Piglet, do you wanna
come out and play?

08:37.750 --> 08:40.291
Piglet's not at home.

08:40.291 --> 08:42.708
If Piglet's not at home,

08:42.708 --> 08:45.500
then who am I talkin' to?

08:45.500 --> 08:46.583
No one.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.708
Especially not Piglet.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.708
Eeyore just needs to be
put in his place,

08:58.708 --> 09:01.583
as the bouncee,
not the bouncer.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.875
And I'm just the Tigger
to do it.

09:03.875 --> 09:08.000
- Tally-hoo!
- Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.583
How humiloratin'.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.208
Out bounced by a donkey.

09:12.208 --> 09:15.000
Do you wanna
play with me, Tigger?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.875
No. I don't ever wanna
play with you again.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.458
Never, ever.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.583
Why, why, you're a menace.

09:21.583 --> 09:23.375
Imagine,

09:23.375 --> 09:26.875
goin' about bouncin'
helpless Tiggers like me.

09:29.333 --> 09:30.375
Tigger?

09:32.458 --> 09:34.708
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

09:37.708 --> 09:40.458
All right,
forward, everyone.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.416
We'll find that donkey
and--

09:42.416 --> 09:44.583
un-Tiggerize him.

09:44.583 --> 09:49.750
Yeah,
we'll scrub those stripes
right off his back.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.833
After all,

09:52.833 --> 09:55.875
what are friends for?

09:55.875 --> 09:58.500
Uh, Tigger,
what are you doing
under there?

09:58.500 --> 09:59.750
Hidin' from Eeyore.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.375
I'm disguised as a couch.

10:13.375 --> 10:14.500
Thank you.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.583
Don't mention it.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.000
Whatcha lookin' for?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.750
Oh, we're looking for Eeyore,
Eeyore.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.750
Didn't know
he was so popular.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.250
He's not.
He's just--

10:26.250 --> 10:28.625
Ohh, d-d-d-dear!

10:31.708 --> 10:34.583
Now stay back!

10:34.583 --> 10:36.625
Yeah.
No bouncin' allowed.

10:36.625 --> 10:39.708
The water.
Gopher, use the water.

10:41.083 --> 10:44.166
Thanks, Gopher, I--

10:44.166 --> 10:46.416
Wait a minute.
Eeyore,

10:46.416 --> 10:49.125
what happened to
your stripes?

10:49.125 --> 10:51.875
Maybe friend Eeyore
misplaced them.

10:51.875 --> 10:56.875
Nope. Just got lonely
bein' so popular.

10:56.875 --> 10:59.166
Figure being boring old me

10:59.166 --> 11:02.583
was better than tryin' to be
something I ain't.

11:02.583 --> 11:05.708
Hope you're not
too disappointed.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.125
Not at all, Eeyore.

11:08.125 --> 11:11.500
I happen to like you, uh,
the way you are.

11:11.500 --> 11:15.458
Uh, wouldn't have you
any other way, sonny.

11:15.458 --> 11:18.375
Yeah. Besides,
there's only room
for one Tigger,

11:18.375 --> 11:20.125
and that's me,
buddy boy.

11:20.125 --> 11:22.125
Oh, Eeyore.

11:22.125 --> 11:25.708
I'm sorry
being popular, uh--

11:25.708 --> 11:27.625
didn't work out.

11:27.625 --> 11:30.375
Well, it wasn't
a total waste.

11:30.375 --> 11:32.833
At least I learned
to say hello.

11:32.833 --> 11:35.000
Hello, Eeyore.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Hello.

11:43.625 --> 11:45.708
Narrator:
The lightning flashed.

11:45.708 --> 11:47.833
The wind roared.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.875
It was a dark
and blustery night.

11:51.583 --> 11:54.833
Three worried souls
gathered at the stately,

11:54.833 --> 11:57.458
yet creaky, mansion.

11:59.708 --> 12:04.083
I suppose you're wondering
why I called you all here
tonight,

12:04.083 --> 12:06.208
said the private eye.

12:06.208 --> 12:08.166
It's because
I've discovered

12:08.166 --> 12:10.875
who stole the
Glockenspiel diamond.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.875
He's someone
in this very room!

12:16.708 --> 12:18.458
And that someone is...

12:22.583 --> 12:27.416
Oh, my, it's become
quite dark in here.

12:27.416 --> 12:29.250
Well? Well?

12:29.250 --> 12:31.708
Who swiped the diamond?

12:31.708 --> 12:33.208
Was it the butler?

12:33.208 --> 12:35.000
Well, I'm not sure, Pooh.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.333
I'm afraid I can't see
in this light

12:37.333 --> 12:39.875
without my reading glasses.

12:39.875 --> 12:42.416
I lost them
two weeks ago.

12:42.416 --> 12:44.583
Oh, I don't know where
you're glasses are,

12:44.583 --> 12:46.500
but how about
using these instead?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.416
My glasses!

12:48.416 --> 12:49.583
You found them.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.583
I, oh--
I did?

12:51.583 --> 12:55.750
Why, Tigger, you'd make
a much better private eye

12:55.750 --> 12:57.375
than the hero of this book.

12:57.375 --> 13:00.458
Oh, shucks.

13:00.458 --> 13:02.416
It was--
You really think so?

13:02.416 --> 13:03.958
Pooh: Oh, yes.

13:03.958 --> 13:07.416
Not just anyone
could have found
Owl's glasses

13:07.416 --> 13:09.583
on top of his head.

13:09.583 --> 13:12.291
Me? A private ear?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.333
Yeah.

13:14.416 --> 13:17.875
"Tigger.
Private Ear.

13:17.875 --> 13:21.000
"If you can lose it,

13:21.000 --> 13:26.708
- "we can--
we can--
- "find it."

13:26.708 --> 13:29.583
My first customer.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.416
Step right in,
buddy bear,

13:31.416 --> 13:34.166
and let me solve your
baffling mystery for ya.

13:35.166 --> 13:37.166
So, what's the problem?

13:37.166 --> 13:39.083
Actually,

13:39.083 --> 13:41.000
I've run out of honey.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.583
But that's no crime.

13:43.583 --> 13:46.333
It is for a Pooh bear.

13:46.333 --> 13:49.125
Well, how can I be
a superior sleuth

13:49.125 --> 13:51.583
when I got no mysteries
to solve?

13:53.083 --> 13:55.875
Wait a minute.

13:55.875 --> 13:58.291
If I was to make
a mystery,

13:58.291 --> 14:00.333
and then solve it,

14:00.333 --> 14:03.333
why, I'd be up to
my private ears in work.

14:03.333 --> 14:04.958
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

14:14.708 --> 14:15.750
Ah-choo!

14:20.750 --> 14:21.833
- Piglet! Piglet!

14:21.833 --> 14:22.875
- Whoa!
- Wake up!

14:25.708 --> 14:28.000
Uh, thought I'd
drop by and, uh--

14:28.000 --> 14:31.500
uh, see if you need
any mysteries solved.

14:31.500 --> 14:36.166
Uh, uh, you, uh,
feelin' okay?

14:36.166 --> 14:39.458
Uh, I feel fine, Tigger,

14:39.458 --> 14:41.750
though my nose is a bit cold.

14:41.750 --> 14:45.458
Oh, d-d-d-dear.
My nose warmer is gone.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.500
Rrrawrrr.

14:51.166 --> 14:54.458
I suppose
you're all wondering why
I called you here tonight.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.625
It's on account of Piglet's
missing nose warmer.

14:57.625 --> 15:01.166
Which I, Tigger,
private ear,

15:01.166 --> 15:03.708
intend to find.

15:03.708 --> 15:05.833
Uh, private ear?

15:05.833 --> 15:08.208
Now I've heard everything.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.375
Yeah? Where was you
on the night of 15th?

15:11.375 --> 15:12.875
The 15th?

15:12.875 --> 15:14.291
Why I--

15:14.291 --> 15:17.000
And where was you
on the night of the 43rd?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.416
Um, asleep.

15:19.416 --> 15:22.375
What about you?

15:22.375 --> 15:24.375
Oh, I was in that bed

15:24.375 --> 15:26.458
dreaming about
picking daffodils, and--

15:26.458 --> 15:27.875
Ah-ha!

15:27.875 --> 15:30.083
This case is solved.

15:31.500 --> 15:35.208
Piglet was here
dreaming about daffodils,

15:35.208 --> 15:38.583
which, as every genius
private ear knows--

15:39.583 --> 15:41.750
Piglets are allergical to.

15:41.750 --> 15:44.416
Ah-choo!

15:44.416 --> 15:46.708
The little guy
sneezed in his sleep,

15:46.708 --> 15:49.583
blowin' his nose warmer
off his face,

15:49.583 --> 15:51.458
and onto...

15:51.458 --> 15:53.583
the ceiling!

15:53.583 --> 15:55.583
My nose warmer.

15:55.583 --> 15:57.833
Amazing.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.583
Oh, nothin' to it.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.208
No case is too small for

16:02.208 --> 16:05.208
Tigger, private ear.

16:06.958 --> 16:11.083
Oh, another day
and still no customers.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.708
Maybe I need to make
one more mystery

16:13.708 --> 16:16.125
to convince 'em of my skills.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.708
Ah-ha.

16:24.708 --> 16:27.583
The honey he keeps for his
midnight snackles.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.000
Oh.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.625
That one's in
too many pieces.

16:36.625 --> 16:40.583
Uh, now who else
would have a honey pot?

16:46.708 --> 16:49.583
Pooh: Last night,
the honey was here,

16:49.583 --> 16:52.125
but this morning
it wasn't.

16:52.125 --> 16:54.750
So I can only think...

16:54.750 --> 16:56.375
it's gone.

16:56.375 --> 16:59.125
If you can lose it,
we can find it.

16:59.125 --> 17:01.750
My brilliant
private ear's nose

17:01.750 --> 17:05.958
concludes that Pooh's
missing honey pot is...

17:05.958 --> 17:07.166
right here!

17:07.166 --> 17:10.000
Oh, it is my honey.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.208
Help! Thief!

17:11.208 --> 17:12.291
Robbed!

17:12.291 --> 17:13.958
Ooh, I've been robbed!

17:13.958 --> 17:15.291
Come quickly!

17:17.000 --> 17:20.166
Last night I had
seven honey pots,

17:20.166 --> 17:23.125
and now there are only six.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.875
Someone stole one of
my honey pots.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.875
Rabbit, perhaps Tigger
could find your honey.

17:29.875 --> 17:32.250
Uh, uh, Pooh.
I, uh, uh--

17:32.250 --> 17:34.083
Oh, will you, Tigger?

17:34.083 --> 17:37.500
Please,
you have to help me.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.583
I do?
I mean, I do.

17:40.583 --> 17:45.000
Well, uh, I, uh--
I suppose I could
squeeze you in.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.708
Oh, thank you, Tigger.
Thank you.

17:48.708 --> 17:51.375
Uh, well, let's see,
uh, first I gotta--

17:51.375 --> 17:52.500
I gotta do somethin'.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.500
Ooh, gotta gather some clues.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.333
- A honey bee.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.708
I bet he stole it.

17:58.708 --> 18:00.583
Follow that clue!

18:02.000 --> 18:04.875
The evidence is ducking
into Piglet's house.

18:04.875 --> 18:05.958
Come on.

18:07.708 --> 18:08.750
There he is.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.416
Piglet! What--
What's this doing here?

18:15.416 --> 18:17.875
It's Pooh's birthday gift.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.416
Piglet.

18:19.416 --> 18:21.208
You shouldn't have.

18:21.208 --> 18:22.708
No, indeed.

18:22.708 --> 18:24.583
You should have
asked me first.

18:24.583 --> 18:27.708
You shouldn't
just have taken it.

18:27.708 --> 18:29.583
Oh, but I didn't.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.958
And what seems to be
the commotion?

18:31.958 --> 18:34.708
Some honey
seems to have been--

18:34.708 --> 18:37.083
misplaced.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.375
Oh, but I didn't.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.291
But there it is.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.625
Only one thing to do.

18:42.625 --> 18:45.416
We must find out
the truth.

18:46.833 --> 18:48.708
Now, I know that
Piglet didn't do it,

18:48.708 --> 18:50.708
and you know that
Piglet didn't do it.

18:50.708 --> 18:52.375
All I gotta do is
convince the others

18:52.375 --> 18:53.833
that he didn't do it

18:53.833 --> 18:55.833
without letting them know
that I dood it.

18:58.708 --> 19:00.875
My first question is

19:00.875 --> 19:04.083
why did you take
my honey pot?

19:04.083 --> 19:06.875
Don't worry, Piglet.
I'll get you off with
8 to 20.

19:06.875 --> 19:09.625
Or 9 to 5,
whichever comes first.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.583
Uh, uh, by the way,

19:11.583 --> 19:12.958
why did you take
Rabbit's honey?

19:12.958 --> 19:14.583
I didn't.

19:14.583 --> 19:18.583
Ha! Your honorableness,
I rest the rest of my case.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.875
Gentle people
of the jury--

19:24.875 --> 19:26.500
And donkeys.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.750
And donkeys,

19:28.750 --> 19:31.125
I just want to say,

19:31.125 --> 19:33.500
he took my honey pot.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.458
- He didn't.
- Did.

19:35.458 --> 19:36.458
- Didn't.
- Did.

19:36.458 --> 19:37.833
Quiet!

19:37.833 --> 19:40.958
Can't a body get
some sleep around here?

19:40.958 --> 19:43.458
Your honor,
the verdict?

19:43.458 --> 19:46.000
Don't rush me,
sonny.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.458
Okay, jury,
whatcha got to say?

19:49.458 --> 19:53.375
I should like to recite
my favorite poem.

19:53.375 --> 19:56.500
It's called
"Ode to an Owl."

19:56.500 --> 19:59.166
- Oh--
- Get to the point!

19:59.166 --> 20:01.125
Not really sure,

20:01.125 --> 20:03.875
but I suppose since he's
a little piglet,

20:03.875 --> 20:06.083
maybe he's a little guilty.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.583
It can't be!

20:07.583 --> 20:09.083
I thought I did it.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.416
I reject!
I reject!

20:11.416 --> 20:13.875
I'd like to call
a surprise witness.

20:13.875 --> 20:16.250
- Who?
- Uh, can't tell ya.

20:16.250 --> 20:17.875
It'd spoil the surprise.

20:17.875 --> 20:20.000
I call as my
next witness...

20:20.000 --> 20:22.375
me.

20:22.375 --> 20:25.458
Do I swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,
and nothin' but the truth?

20:25.458 --> 20:27.166
You betcha.

20:27.166 --> 20:30.375
Okay, you,
did Piglet take
Rabbit's honey?

20:31.458 --> 20:33.708
No, no, he was framed,
I tell ya.

20:33.708 --> 20:36.250
He's innocent.
I tell ya, he's innocent.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.083
Framed?

20:38.083 --> 20:39.500
Framed by who?

20:39.500 --> 20:41.333
Not the butler,
was it?

20:41.333 --> 20:42.708
The butler?

20:42.708 --> 20:44.875
Well, no--
You see-

20:44.875 --> 20:47.875
The witness will please
answer the question.

20:47.875 --> 20:50.833
Unless you got
somethin' to hide.

20:52.375 --> 20:53.500
Who, me?

20:53.500 --> 20:55.625
What do I have to hide?

20:55.625 --> 20:58.375
Uh, I didn't take
any honey pots.

20:58.375 --> 21:00.208
Tiggers don't even
like honey,

21:00.208 --> 21:01.708
so I wouldn't, uh--

21:01.708 --> 21:03.875
I mean, I mean,
I couldn't have been--

21:03.875 --> 21:05.000
It couldn't have been--

21:15.416 --> 21:18.375
You're sure
you didn't take it?

21:18.375 --> 21:19.708
A honey pot!

21:19.708 --> 21:21.875
Uh, they're
comin' to get me!

21:23.000 --> 21:24.875
I confess.
I confess!

21:24.875 --> 21:26.875
It was me.
I did it. I did it!

21:26.875 --> 21:30.291
I took Rabbit's honey pot
and put it in Pooh's house
to find

21:30.291 --> 21:33.208
so everybody would think
I was a great private ear.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.291
I throws myself at
the mercy of the court.

21:38.125 --> 21:42.875
Piglet,
this court finds you

21:42.875 --> 21:44.125
not guilty!

21:46.333 --> 21:48.291
Oh, thank you, Tigger.

21:49.833 --> 21:52.166
Rabbit: After all the trouble
you caused,

21:52.166 --> 21:56.166
I hope you won't ever try
this private ear nonsense
again.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.000
Ah, buddy boy,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.750
I figure I've cleared up
enough mysteries for a while.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.458
Besides, I did so well
with Piglet,

22:03.458 --> 22:05.458
I've decided to become...

22:05.458 --> 22:06.708
a lawyer.

22:06.708 --> 22:08.833
Tigger,
a Tigger at law.

22:08.833 --> 22:11.375
If you can find it,
we can lose it for ya.

22:11.375 --> 22:12.750
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
