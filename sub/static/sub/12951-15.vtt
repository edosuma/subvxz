00:01.201 --> 00:02.399
Previously on "Alias"...

00:02.400 --> 00:05.832
SD-6 has nothing
to do with the CIA.

00:05.934 --> 00:08.166
Dixon, you've been lied to.

00:08.167 --> 00:09.332
What are you...

00:09.333 --> 00:12.299
SD-6 is part of The Alliance!

00:12.400 --> 00:14.266
You have been working
for the enemy

00:14.267 --> 00:16.767
you thought you were fighting.

00:18.767 --> 00:21.033
We've gotten reports
from the team leaders.

00:21.034 --> 00:24.000
We appear to be in control
of all Alliance facilities.

00:24.134 --> 00:25.766
Dixon...

00:25.767 --> 00:28.267
Let's go.
Come on.

00:31.167 --> 00:33.724
Look, this will be over soon.
I promise.

00:34.834 --> 00:37.334
Don't talk to me.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.166
You're so beautiful.

00:45.167 --> 00:47.667
Dinner's ready.

00:48.267 --> 00:51.131
You do have an oven, you know.
We can reheat.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.568 --> 01:14.734
How are we
gonna stay awake today?

01:14.735 --> 01:17.633
Who cares?

01:18.735 --> 01:21.428
# I see it around me #

01:21.534 --> 01:26.659
# I see it in everything #

01:27.735 --> 01:30.235
Vaughn?

01:30.768 --> 01:32.534
How come you never
call me Michael?

01:32.535 --> 01:35.035
I do sometimes.

01:36.668 --> 01:37.667
Vaughn?

01:37.668 --> 01:39.368
What?

01:39.369 --> 01:41.601
I'm graduating today.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.434
What?

01:43.435 --> 01:46.662
When the hell did you have time
to take a class this year?

01:46.768 --> 01:49.995
I wasn't even gonna go
to the ceremony, but...

01:51.836 --> 01:55.495
I've been lying here remembering
why I never gave school up,

01:55.602 --> 01:58.500
and why I killed myself
writing papers

01:58.635 --> 02:00.968
instead of just...

02:00.969 --> 02:03.594
I don't know...

02:03.736 --> 02:06.668
accepting that I'd be
an agent forever.

02:12.869 --> 02:15.699
You're gonna quit the CIA,
aren't you?

02:17.136 --> 02:19.966
I'm afraid I can't
endorse your resignation.

02:20.069 --> 02:21.368
Excuse me?

02:21.369 --> 02:23.068
With The Alliance gone,
we got a mess to clean up.

02:23.069 --> 02:24.401
You don't need me.

02:24.402 --> 02:26.368
That's opinion.
And what about Arvin Sloane,

02:26.369 --> 02:29.164
whom you would have an interest
in bringing to justice?

02:29.199 --> 02:31.959
Sloane is a cog in a machine
that doesn't exist anymore.

02:32.103 --> 02:33.801
He's wanted in 40 countries.

02:33.802 --> 02:36.102
I did everything
for the CIA I said I would.

02:36.103 --> 02:38.002
And I'm done.

02:38.003 --> 02:41.526
Jack, you want to jump in here?

02:44.702 --> 02:46.602
For years, I wanted nothing more

02:46.603 --> 02:49.103
than to see you
live a normal life.

02:50.436 --> 02:53.368
However, your value to the CIA
is irrefutable.

02:53.470 --> 02:55.469
So, while this is your choice,

02:55.470 --> 02:58.833
I suggest that, given the
enormity of the last two weeks,

02:58.936 --> 03:01.268
you may not want to make
life-altering decisions

03:01.269 --> 03:03.102
without a little more
perspective.

03:03.103 --> 03:06.035
I've had two years
of perspective.

03:06.136 --> 03:08.469
I am through letting
Arvin Sloane control my life,

03:08.470 --> 03:10.435
and I don't need
your approval to resign.

03:10.436 --> 03:11.936
I told you as a courtesy.

03:11.937 --> 03:14.168
I will pay you the courtesy
of informing you

03:14.169 --> 03:15.469
if you leave this agency,

03:15.470 --> 03:18.594
you forfeit the clearance
to see your mother.

03:18.703 --> 03:20.302
Are you blackmailing me?

03:20.303 --> 03:22.803
Civilians aren't authorized
to be in this facility,

03:22.837 --> 03:24.235
let alone have access
to a terrorist

03:24.236 --> 03:26.268
we can't acknowledge
is in custody.

03:26.269 --> 03:28.702
In or out, kiddo.

03:28.703 --> 03:31.203
Can't have it both ways.

03:36.536 --> 03:39.161
Legally, he's right.

03:39.304 --> 03:41.804
Ethically, he's an ass.

04:08.604 --> 04:10.136
Congratulations.

04:10.137 --> 04:13.625
Your father told me
about your success.

04:15.304 --> 04:17.737
What about your associates
at SD-6?

04:17.738 --> 04:18.903
You had friends there.

04:18.904 --> 04:22.130
I haven't seen them.
They're being debriefed.

04:24.404 --> 04:26.837
I'm sorry I haven't been
to see you in a while.

04:26.838 --> 04:27.937
I understand.

04:27.938 --> 04:31.335
I'm sure this has been
overwhelming for you.

04:37.138 --> 04:38.770
I graduate today.

04:38.771 --> 04:41.271
I know.

04:43.604 --> 04:45.837
I would think
you'd be more relieved

04:45.838 --> 04:48.633
with SD-6 and The Alliance gone.

04:52.338 --> 04:55.497
I'm thinking of leaving the CIA,

04:55.604 --> 04:58.593
which would mean...

04:58.704 --> 05:02.067
giving up my clearance
to see you.

05:07.705 --> 05:09.903
You're too forgiving, Sydney.

05:09.904 --> 05:12.404
Don't pretend
I'm something I'm not.

05:12.405 --> 05:16.235
I've never been
a real mother to you, and...

05:16.338 --> 05:18.838
you don't owe me
a second chance.

05:19.238 --> 05:22.068
If you make this decision
about me, you're a fool.

05:23.005 --> 05:25.505
In fact, if you decide to stay,

05:25.538 --> 05:28.129
I won't agree
to see you anymore.

05:34.739 --> 05:37.239
Take care of yourself.

06:00.339 --> 06:03.100
Aaron! Aaron!
Aaron! Don't run.

06:03.206 --> 06:05.171
I want to go back
to the jellyfish.

06:05.172 --> 06:07.105
Always make sure we can see you.

06:07.106 --> 06:09.606
And hold on to your jacket.
Aaron...

06:15.606 --> 06:16.804
Okay.

06:16.805 --> 06:19.305
So, you're gonna stay here,
right?

06:19.339 --> 06:20.605
Yes, mommy.

06:20.606 --> 06:22.171
- You gonna stay here?
- Yeah.

06:22.172 --> 06:23.338
- Okay?
- Yeah.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.839
I'll be over there with Daddy.

06:28.806 --> 06:31.306
Where are you?

06:31.539 --> 06:33.472
Here. I'm here.

06:33.473 --> 06:38.030
Neil, it's Aaron's birthday.
Your head's at the blackboard.

06:38.139 --> 06:40.639
Honey...

06:41.806 --> 06:43.739
I just...

06:43.740 --> 06:45.905
I need two more months,
that's it.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.006
I am this close.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.638
I can't stand more
promises you don't keep.

06:48.639 --> 06:50.239
I don't know how to do this.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.739
There are other fields.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.072
Once the polytechnics
goes public with the design,

06:54.073 --> 06:56.573
then I'll slow down.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.605
I mean, I'll stop.

06:58.606 --> 07:01.106
I promise.

07:02.773 --> 07:05.273
Think about your father.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.831
Aaron's growing up,
and you're missing it.

07:17.607 --> 07:20.107
Where is he?

07:26.507 --> 07:28.039
- Aaron!
- Aaron!

07:28.040 --> 07:30.106
Aaron? Aaron?

07:30.107 --> 07:31.706
Did you see a little boy?

07:31.707 --> 07:32.773
He's 5 years old.

07:32.774 --> 07:35.072
He's got a striped shirt on,
brown hair.

07:35.073 --> 07:36.873
- His name's Aaron.
- I'm sorry.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.139
- Aaron!
- Check the gift shop.

07:39.140 --> 07:41.640
Aaron!

07:43.807 --> 07:46.307
Mr. Caplan...

07:47.273 --> 07:49.773
I believe I can help you
locate your son...

07:53.041 --> 07:55.541
and your wife.

08:15.008 --> 08:16.440
Okay, seriously?

08:16.441 --> 08:18.040
Oh, my God.

08:18.041 --> 08:20.666
Francie, earrings, necklace?
What do I need?

08:20.774 --> 08:23.274
Let's see.

08:24.941 --> 08:27.441
You look beautiful.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.440
I'm so proud of you.

08:31.441 --> 08:34.032
Thank you.

08:36.107 --> 08:39.539
What's a four-letter word
for "ice-cream thickener"?

08:39.640 --> 08:41.006
Hello?

08:41.008 --> 08:43.006
Agar. A-g-a-r.

08:43.008 --> 08:44.340
How'd you know that?

08:44.341 --> 08:46.307
Phone's for you.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.207
Hello?

08:47.208 --> 08:49.708
Congratulations, Sydney.

08:51.641 --> 08:54.834
You have so many things
to celebrate today.

08:55.775 --> 08:59.207
I myself am still coping
with disappointment of learning

08:59.308 --> 09:02.274
that you and Jack
were double agents.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.875
The two people I trusted
most in the world.

09:04.942 --> 09:07.601
How many S's
are in "Massachusetts"?

09:11.975 --> 09:15.566
Our first honest conversation,
and you have nothing to say?

09:15.708 --> 09:18.108
Listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

09:18.109 --> 09:20.904
You have been
a plague on my life.

09:21.009 --> 09:22.208
You repulse me.

09:22.209 --> 09:24.731
Every time I sat across from you
listening to your lies,

09:24.842 --> 09:28.103
all I could do was fantasize
about slashing your throat!

09:29.942 --> 09:31.874
Well...

09:31.875 --> 09:35.602
I can't pretend to be surprised
that you feel that way.

09:35.708 --> 09:38.901
My only hope is that
you can learn to forgive me.

09:40.376 --> 09:43.637
As hurt as I am,
I know I can forgive you.

09:43.743 --> 09:46.402
After all, Sydney,
I helped you.

09:47.743 --> 09:49.842
What are you talking about?

09:49.843 --> 09:51.641
You don't think
it was a coincidence

09:51.642 --> 09:54.142
that I happened to be away
these last two weeks?

09:54.209 --> 09:55.842
The intel that you acquired

09:55.843 --> 09:58.673
that allowed the CIA
to take down The Alliance...

09:58.776 --> 10:01.042
I provided that.

10:01.043 --> 10:06.634
My involvement with The Alliance
is merely a means to an end.

10:06.743 --> 10:08.575
Why are you telling me this?

10:08.576 --> 10:10.641
Because knowing that I'm alive

10:10.642 --> 10:13.301
is gonna tempt you
to come after me.

10:13.409 --> 10:14.274
Don't.

10:14.275 --> 10:17.638
We've helped set each other
free, Sydney.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.208
And as much as I wish you well,

10:20.243 --> 10:24.141
I will end your life
if you get in my way.

10:27.843 --> 10:31.400
He called me at home to warn me.

10:31.510 --> 10:33.209
No matter where he is,

10:33.210 --> 10:35.710
I can be gotten to.

10:37.343 --> 10:40.173
Unfortunately,
you're not the only one.

10:40.276 --> 10:41.309
Neil Caplan.

10:41.310 --> 10:43.935
He's a mathematician
working out of CalTech.

10:44.043 --> 10:45.609
The bureau just confirmed

10:45.610 --> 10:48.803
he and his family were kidnapped
from the Long Beach Aquarium.

10:48.909 --> 10:52.272
Parking-lot surveillance
cameras recorded this.

10:59.243 --> 11:00.342
Sark.

11:00.343 --> 11:01.743
Doubtful he's acting alone.

11:01.744 --> 11:05.301
I assume his partnership
with Sloane is alive and well.

11:05.410 --> 11:07.075
What do they want
with a mathematician?

11:07.076 --> 11:09.871
He specializes in a branch
called knot theory.

11:09.977 --> 11:11.743
Knot as in "tie a knot"?

11:11.744 --> 11:14.076
It's the study
of geometric objects

11:14.077 --> 11:15.342
and how they fit together.

11:15.343 --> 11:17.843
All Alliance facilities
have been raided.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.210
We haven't found
a single Rambaldi artifact.

11:20.211 --> 11:21.909
If Sloane was expecting
our raid,

11:21.910 --> 11:24.432
he could've had everything moved
to a secure location.

11:24.543 --> 11:26.442
He must be using Caplan

11:26.443 --> 11:28.776
to help him assemble
a Rambaldi device.

11:28.777 --> 11:32.368
So, what happens when Sloane
puts the pieces together?

11:32.477 --> 11:34.876
Whether or not you believe
Rambaldi was a prophet,

11:34.877 --> 11:37.143
he did anticipate
technological advances.

11:37.144 --> 11:39.905
Many of which seem
most applicable to warfare.

11:40.011 --> 11:42.909
It's likely
Sloane is building a weapon.

11:48.111 --> 11:50.611
He planned for this.

11:50.678 --> 11:53.371
He wanted The Alliance gone.

11:54.611 --> 11:57.111
And this family
that he's taken hostage,

11:57.144 --> 12:00.473
these aren't the only people
whose lives he'll destroy.

12:04.144 --> 12:06.644
This is never gonna stop.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.744
Your resignation form.

12:11.745 --> 12:14.245
sign it, and you're out.

13:13.412 --> 13:15.912
Your glasses.

13:20.078 --> 13:23.044
Mr. Caplan,
my name is Arvin Sloane.

13:23.145 --> 13:24.578
Where's my family?

13:24.579 --> 13:25.778
They're alive.

13:25.779 --> 13:29.836
And if you cooperate,
you'll be reunited soon enough.

13:29.946 --> 13:32.446
Where am I?

13:34.146 --> 13:36.178
Years ago...

13:36.179 --> 13:39.702
I was with the Army Corps
of Engineers.

13:39.846 --> 13:42.835
They wanted me to study this.

13:44.846 --> 13:48.869
That manuscript
is 500 years old.

13:50.046 --> 13:54.637
Those sketches were drawn
by a man named Milo Rambaldi.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.246
You will see
that Rambaldi prophesied

13:57.279 --> 14:00.268
scientific principles
centuries ahead of his time.

14:00.346 --> 14:02.479
Prototypes of his designs
have turned up

14:02.480 --> 14:04.980
all over the world.

14:05.346 --> 14:08.039
For the past 30 years,
I've been collecting them.

14:08.146 --> 14:11.441
I don't understand
why you want me.

14:11.580 --> 14:12.712
I'm nobody.

14:12.713 --> 14:15.213
You're gonna help me
put them together,

14:15.346 --> 14:17.212
because, you see, Mr. Caplan,

14:17.213 --> 14:18.911
I know that you feel like

14:18.912 --> 14:21.935
you're only a hostage right now,

14:22.046 --> 14:24.045
but I assume
you became a scientist

14:24.046 --> 14:27.773
to discover what secrets
the universe has to offer.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.004
Believe me,
when we're done here,

14:31.113 --> 14:33.874
you'll be thanking me
for giving you the answers.

14:35.580 --> 14:38.080
So why don't you go ahead
and take a look.

15:15.014 --> 15:17.146
I wanted to be the one

15:17.147 --> 15:19.840
to come in and tell you
officially

15:19.980 --> 15:22.446
that you've been cleared.

15:22.447 --> 15:25.571
The CIA has concluded
that you had no knowledge

15:25.681 --> 15:28.113
of what was really
going on at SD-6.

15:28.114 --> 15:30.614
They want to offer you
a place here.

15:36.214 --> 15:39.112
Dixon, you have to know
that you were my anchor.

15:42.447 --> 15:46.470
Your friendship was the only
thing that kept me sane.

15:51.215 --> 15:53.715
How long have you known?

15:55.447 --> 15:57.813
Two years.

15:57.814 --> 16:02.872
I wanted to tell you
so many times,

16:02.981 --> 16:05.776
but I was ordered not to.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.214
The CIA had no way to verify

16:08.215 --> 16:10.114
what I knew in my heart
was true.

16:10.115 --> 16:12.842
That you would never
consciously work

16:12.948 --> 16:15.448
for a man like Arvin Sloane.

16:19.448 --> 16:21.948
We were partners.

16:24.148 --> 16:26.943
You lied to me...

16:27.081 --> 16:30.706
then chose to tell me the truth
when it was convenient for you.

16:34.682 --> 16:37.477
I never...

16:37.582 --> 16:40.082
want to see you again.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.346
I'll need taps into all gov
networks. NSA, DOD, FBI, CIA.

16:58.482 --> 17:00.115
I'll need a red phone
to the President.

17:00.116 --> 17:01.614
- No.
- I just thought I'd ask.

17:01.615 --> 17:03.215
I'll need a cryogen
ATR prototype rig.

17:03.216 --> 17:06.375
Don't worry,
it won't be too loud.

17:08.482 --> 17:10.982
Wow.

17:14.682 --> 17:17.409
Marshall, I'm Michael Vaughn.
Welcome to the CIA.

17:17.516 --> 17:18.848
Heard that one before.

17:18.848 --> 17:20.214
This time, it's real.

17:20.215 --> 17:22.315
- We have a desk for you.
- Oh, okay.

17:22.316 --> 17:23.315
Oh, Syd.

17:23.316 --> 17:25.816
- Marshall.
- Hey.

17:27.316 --> 17:28.881
You okay?

17:28.882 --> 17:31.871
Every few minutes, I have
to fight the urge to weep.

17:32.016 --> 17:33.648
I'm not sure
where that's coming from,

17:33.649 --> 17:35.582
but I think
that's healthy, right?

17:35.583 --> 17:39.276
I know you need time to adjust,
but we could use your help.

17:39.383 --> 17:41.582
We're trying to find Sloane,
but we can't access

17:41.583 --> 17:43.749
any information
from his computer.

17:43.750 --> 17:46.580
He probably erased everything
from his hard drive,

17:46.683 --> 17:48.181
and the deletion program
I installed

17:48.182 --> 17:49.682
exceeded DOD sanitizing
standards

17:49.683 --> 17:51.749
'cause I thought I was working
for the government.

17:51.750 --> 17:54.248
You know the story,
'cause you thought...

17:54.249 --> 17:57.079
You actually were working
for the government.

17:57.182 --> 17:59.181
But, I mean, that's okay.

17:59.182 --> 18:01.682
I'll see what I can do.

18:06.983 --> 18:08.648
Hey, baby.

18:08.649 --> 18:10.882
Got your message.

18:10.883 --> 18:13.383
Sorry your business trip
was delayed.

18:22.150 --> 18:23.648
Where are the kids?

18:23.649 --> 18:25.682
At the park with Mindy.

18:25.683 --> 18:29.342
Glad the bank at least gave you
the rest of the day off.

18:31.484 --> 18:33.149
Diane.

18:33.150 --> 18:35.650
Hmm?

18:35.816 --> 18:38.316
We need to talk.

18:41.850 --> 18:43.616
What is it?

18:43.617 --> 18:44.750
Is it your mother?

18:44.751 --> 18:47.251
No.

18:53.484 --> 18:55.984
I don't work at a bank.

18:58.050 --> 19:00.550
I never have.

19:03.884 --> 19:06.349
I was able to recover
a few fragments

19:06.350 --> 19:08.282
from the RAM drive
on Sloane's database.

19:08.283 --> 19:10.516
One of them was the most
recent doc he was working on.

19:10.517 --> 19:11.549
It's a digital Rolodex.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.107
Now, he checked one address
in particular.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.583
Holden Gendler, Van Nuys.

19:16.584 --> 19:18.649
Guy's a cybernetic specialist.

19:18.650 --> 19:21.150
I'll go.

20:06.184 --> 20:09.638
Okay, now, usually red-eye
is a photographic effect

20:09.752 --> 20:11.550
caused by light reflecting
in the pupil.

20:11.551 --> 20:15.074
But in Holden Gendler's case,
it was caused by this.

20:16.618 --> 20:18.350
It's an intra-ocular
retinal implant.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.018
You care to elaborate?

20:20.019 --> 20:22.746
Of course, Mr. Ken... Director.

20:22.885 --> 20:24.584
Director, uh, Kendall, right?

20:24.585 --> 20:25.751
Um, it's one "L"?

20:25.752 --> 20:26.751
Two.

20:26.752 --> 20:28.617
It's two. Of course.

20:28.618 --> 20:31.811
By the way, sir, this place...
so much cooler than SD-6.

20:31.918 --> 20:34.884
- How about the point?
- Of course. Sorry.

20:34.985 --> 20:37.610
This guy Gendler,
he was blind in his left eye.

20:37.718 --> 20:41.172
He used himself as a guinea pig
for wetware experiments,

20:41.285 --> 20:44.308
interfacing technology
with the human brain.

20:44.419 --> 20:47.180
This implant connects
with the optical nerve,

20:47.285 --> 20:49.585
which sends impulses to
the vision center in his brain.

20:49.586 --> 20:51.917
What did Sloane want
with a wetware expert?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.418
All Alliance members were
injected with a tracking device.

20:54.552 --> 20:56.151
Sloane must have hired Gendler

20:56.152 --> 20:58.251
to deactivate his
so he could disappear.

20:58.252 --> 20:59.518
Right, but there's more.

20:59.519 --> 21:02.280
This records everything it sees
on an internal memory.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.585
The L.E.D. light was
blinking because it was full,

21:04.586 --> 21:07.279
so I was able to download
12 hours of footage.

21:07.386 --> 21:10.476
There was no audio, so I created
a lip-reading program.

21:10.586 --> 21:13.518
Just whipped it up,
no extra charge.

21:13.619 --> 21:15.585
And...

21:15.586 --> 21:18.086
take a look at what I found.

21:18.719 --> 21:21.219
This is the last thing
Gendler saw.

21:29.552 --> 21:32.052
Mr. Sloane.

21:32.786 --> 21:34.285
It's Sloane.

21:34.286 --> 21:36.945
I've chartered a C-123
out of Shipman

21:37.053 --> 21:38.785
to transport the artifacts.

21:38.786 --> 21:40.386
I'll be in touch.

21:40.387 --> 21:42.887
"Shipman" could refer

21:42.986 --> 21:45.884
to the airfield
in the Mojave Desert.

21:45.986 --> 21:48.918
It's operated by a transatlantic
smuggling cartel...

21:49.020 --> 21:52.611
ex-military, dishonorably
discharged after the Gulf War.

21:52.719 --> 21:54.552
They're well-armed,
highly organized,

21:54.553 --> 21:56.685
and they do have
a C-123 in their fleet.

21:56.686 --> 21:59.379
I can have a tactical team
there in three hours.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.519
Once these guys understand
their legal options,

22:01.520 --> 22:03.619
they'll be inclined
to tell us where Sloane went.

22:03.620 --> 22:06.120
Interrogating the employees
could take days,

22:06.253 --> 22:09.309
and Sloane doesn't let hostages
go when he's done with them.

22:09.420 --> 22:10.852
I'm open to suggestions.

22:10.853 --> 22:13.019
If we could get
into the facility

22:13.020 --> 22:14.519
and access
the flight data recorder

22:14.520 --> 22:16.619
on the plane Sloane chartered,

22:16.620 --> 22:20.017
we could track him directly
to his last destination.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.620
Spoken like a true volunteer.

22:29.787 --> 22:32.287
I'm hungry.

22:40.353 --> 22:41.953
Where's my husband?

22:41.954 --> 22:43.719
Your husband
is a gifted individual,

22:43.720 --> 22:46.947
and we need his assistance
for a short while.

22:47.054 --> 22:50.611
Should he choose to cooperate,
this will soon be a memory.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.886
We'd like for you
to tell your husband

22:55.887 --> 22:58.120
that you support his cooperation

22:58.121 --> 23:00.487
and that if he doesn't...

23:00.488 --> 23:02.619
your son will be
the first to suffer.

23:02.620 --> 23:06.177
Oh, God.

23:30.988 --> 23:33.954
I need these shipped
to Beijing by tomorrow.

23:35.388 --> 23:38.820
You know what I find
most interesting, Mr. Ludlow?

23:38.921 --> 23:42.648
Is that for an accomplished
arms merchant...

23:42.788 --> 23:44.620
I've never heard your name.

23:46.621 --> 23:48.453
Now...

23:48.454 --> 23:51.045
if you really are an expert,

23:51.155 --> 23:54.279
you'll know what gun is pointed
at the back of your head

23:54.388 --> 23:56.888
by the sound of the hammer.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.187
An M1911.

24:01.188 --> 24:04.278
But if he were really
gonna shoot me,

24:04.389 --> 24:06.889
he would've disengaged
the thumb safety.

24:10.055 --> 24:12.488
I got a charter leaving
for Asia in half an hour.

24:12.489 --> 24:14.787
If the money
and the delivery instructions

24:14.788 --> 24:17.221
are in that briefcase,
as we discussed,

24:17.222 --> 24:20.017
it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

24:42.622 --> 24:44.988
Good call on the gun.
I would've said Beretta M9.

24:44.989 --> 24:47.254
Figured I had a 50/50 chance.

24:47.255 --> 24:48.921
Found the aft access panel.

24:48.922 --> 24:51.422
Looking for
the flight data recorder.

24:52.355 --> 24:54.588
Found it.

24:54.589 --> 24:57.089
Attaching the disk imager.

24:57.989 --> 25:00.489
Receiving uplink.

25:07.489 --> 25:09.989
Uplink complete.
Get out of there.

25:11.622 --> 25:13.821
I don't have a work order
on this aircraft.

25:13.822 --> 25:16.322
Give me your I.D.
I'm calling this in.

25:18.889 --> 25:21.389
I need confirmation on...

25:22.056 --> 25:23.689
Vaughn, I've been made.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.190
Meet me at the northwest hangar.

26:05.024 --> 26:07.524
Get in!

26:09.656 --> 26:12.156
Go!

26:52.891 --> 26:56.050
Where did you stay last night?

26:56.157 --> 26:58.679
At my sister's.

26:58.824 --> 27:01.324
The kids are there.

27:06.624 --> 27:09.817
The time you were shot...

27:09.924 --> 27:12.424
you told me
that you had been mugged.

27:15.058 --> 27:20.684
If you had died that day,
I would have buried a stranger.

27:20.791 --> 27:23.416
Look, I don't know
if a single word

27:23.524 --> 27:26.024
you have ever said to me
was true.

27:32.225 --> 27:34.725
My love for you is true.

27:36.492 --> 27:38.992
My love for our children
is true.

27:39.091 --> 27:42.648
As a husband...

27:42.758 --> 27:45.258
as a father...

27:48.058 --> 27:51.114
I couldn't honestly say
I was protecting our family

27:51.225 --> 27:52.957
unless I was out there.

27:52.958 --> 27:55.890
You were working for the people
that make the world dangerous.

27:55.991 --> 27:58.923
I thought
I was serving our country.

28:02.026 --> 28:04.526
This man...

28:04.592 --> 28:07.092
Sloane...

28:13.992 --> 28:17.515
I will never lie to you again.

28:20.192 --> 28:22.714
The CIA's offered me a job.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.125
Marcus...

28:32.126 --> 28:34.785
I did not choose
a life of wondering

28:34.892 --> 28:37.619
whether my husband
was coming home every night.

28:40.159 --> 28:42.659
You take that job...

28:44.226 --> 28:46.726
you take it alone.

29:02.493 --> 29:04.993
Will you help us?

29:08.393 --> 29:11.517
You want me to help you,
you let my family go.

29:11.626 --> 29:14.126
That is the only way!

29:14.493 --> 29:15.959
No.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.687
That is not the only way.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.558
Help them.

29:22.559 --> 29:24.792
Do whatever they want, please,

29:24.793 --> 29:27.293
or they're gonna hurt Aaron.

29:39.093 --> 29:41.615
You want me to help you...

29:41.726 --> 29:44.226
put this thing together.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.149
Are you telling me
that these pieces exist?

29:49.293 --> 29:51.793
You're sitting in a warehouse
full of them.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.817
According to this...

29:56.926 --> 30:01.790
each artifact is generating
its own unique magnetic field.

30:01.893 --> 30:04.983
These fields determine where
in the overall design

30:05.093 --> 30:06.326
the pieces go.

30:06.327 --> 30:07.526
The problem is,

30:07.527 --> 30:10.084
there's no room for error
in the calculations.

30:10.193 --> 30:12.292
The equipment you gave me
isn't sensitive enough

30:12.293 --> 30:14.326
for me to measure the fields
with perfect accuracy.

30:14.327 --> 30:16.593
I need something I don't have.

30:16.594 --> 30:18.659
The magnetometer
you're developing

30:18.660 --> 30:21.160
for the Swiss polytechnic.

30:22.994 --> 30:24.526
How do you know about that?

30:24.527 --> 30:27.027
I know about a lot of things.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.755
You're asking me
to do something I cannot do.

30:32.861 --> 30:35.127
The magnetometer was designed

30:35.128 --> 30:37.260
to measure magnetic fields
in space.

30:37.261 --> 30:40.284
It would be sensitive enough
to do this kind of work,

30:40.394 --> 30:42.360
but until it's cleared patent,

30:42.361 --> 30:45.054
the polytechnics have got it
locked up in a vault.

30:45.161 --> 30:47.327
The Amcorp Bank.

30:47.328 --> 30:49.828
It's 2 miles from here.

30:51.961 --> 30:54.461
We're in Switzerland?

30:59.661 --> 31:02.161
By tomorrow,
you'll have what you need.

31:07.461 --> 31:09.160
Just a few more days, Emily.

31:09.161 --> 31:13.354
Well, I'm still waiting
for the owner to counter.

31:13.461 --> 31:15.961
Yeah, of course it has a garden.

31:15.994 --> 31:18.983
I'm looking out the window
at the garden right now.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.327
Yes.

31:20.328 --> 31:22.885
I miss you, too, my love.

31:25.194 --> 31:29.149
What happens when your wife's
ready to move to her villa?

31:29.294 --> 31:31.794
I purchased it six months ago.

31:31.795 --> 31:34.227
I made contact
with our point man.

31:34.228 --> 31:36.853
He's assembling a team
for the bank.

31:36.962 --> 31:40.223
I must question your decision
to lead them in yourself.

31:40.328 --> 31:41.527
In spite of your precautions,

31:41.528 --> 31:44.255
it's risky given
your new level of notoriety.

31:45.795 --> 31:49.352
I'm approaching the finish line
of a 30-year odyssey.

31:50.795 --> 31:54.283
I won't let anyone else
take the final steps for me.

31:58.862 --> 32:00.561
This is the flight plan
we retrieved

32:00.562 --> 32:02.094
from the plane's data recorders.

32:02.095 --> 32:05.027
Sloane left Shipman for an
island off the coast of Bermuda.

32:05.162 --> 32:07.194
We're sending in a team,
but it's doubtful he's there

32:07.195 --> 32:09.595
because the plane
went on to Switzerland.

32:09.596 --> 32:12.153
It's a start, but he could
be anywhere by now.

32:12.262 --> 32:14.294
Unless we assume
Sloane went to Switzerland

32:14.295 --> 32:16.628
for a reason,
that he isn't passing through.

32:16.629 --> 32:19.186
In that case, we can expect him
to hire local support.

32:19.295 --> 32:20.161
Mercenaries.

32:20.162 --> 32:21.894
I dealt with a guy
in Switzerland.

32:21.895 --> 32:24.656
A headhunter we used to
put together a black ops team.

32:24.763 --> 32:26.561
He controls
most of the local territory.

32:26.562 --> 32:28.928
Sloane would use him
if he needed mercs.

32:28.929 --> 32:31.985
If this guy knows you're CIA,
he could tip Sloane off.

32:32.095 --> 32:32.895
He doesn't.

32:32.896 --> 32:35.828
We hired him fronting
as a French crime syndicate.

32:35.929 --> 32:38.918
Set up a meet.
You two are on a plane.

32:52.296 --> 32:54.329
The bank's
facial-recognition cameras

32:54.330 --> 32:56.989
will measure
my underlying bone structure.

32:57.096 --> 32:59.687
The cameras target the distance
between your cheekbones.

32:59.796 --> 33:02.557
The prosthetics I'll apply
are lined with a carbon powder.

33:02.662 --> 33:05.129
The system's database
won't find a match.

33:05.130 --> 33:07.630
Even an X-ray would be fooled.

33:09.963 --> 33:12.463
Well, then, let's begin.

33:54.797 --> 33:57.297
I'm not French Mafia.
I'm CIA.

33:57.830 --> 34:01.455
We've tolerated your existence
because you've been helpful,

34:01.563 --> 34:03.529
but that tolerance can end now.

34:03.530 --> 34:05.763
We have reason to believe
one of these men

34:05.764 --> 34:09.286
recently approached you
to hire some of your contacts.

34:09.398 --> 34:11.898
Warm or cold?

34:12.331 --> 34:13.896
If you had told me the CIA

34:13.897 --> 34:16.263
was simply interested
in my client list,

34:16.264 --> 34:18.063
I would have told you
to go make love

34:18.063 --> 34:19.661
with your mother.

34:19.663 --> 34:20.696
Aah!

34:20.697 --> 34:22.096
Hands!

34:22.097 --> 34:23.728
Aah!

34:23.730 --> 34:26.163
- Tell me!
- You broke my nose!

34:26.164 --> 34:27.196
Talk to me!

34:27.197 --> 34:29.822
Okay, okay, they came.
They hired some men.

34:29.929 --> 34:31.829
- For what?
- I don't know the details.

34:31.830 --> 34:33.096
Tell me what you know!

34:33.097 --> 34:34.663
The woman and the child.
I know where they are.

34:34.664 --> 34:36.663
- Where?!
- In the other room.

34:36.664 --> 34:39.164
Downstairs.

34:40.130 --> 34:42.630
They're here.

34:49.464 --> 34:51.964
C'est moi.

35:05.798 --> 35:07.630
It's okay.

35:07.631 --> 35:10.188
We're CIA agents.
You're safe.

35:10.298 --> 35:12.563
- It's okay.
- You're safe. Come on.

35:12.564 --> 35:15.961
Oh, God!

35:19.831 --> 35:20.930
Where's my husband?

35:20.931 --> 35:23.453
We're looking for him.
We're doing everything we can.

35:23.598 --> 35:25.764
What's your name?

35:25.765 --> 35:27.498
Sydney.
Sydney Bristow.

35:27.499 --> 35:29.264
Thank you, Sydney.

35:29.265 --> 35:31.765
Shh.

35:34.499 --> 35:36.498
One of the guys had a cellphone.

35:36.499 --> 35:38.765
If either Sark or Sloane call,
we can trace him.

35:38.766 --> 35:40.264
We don't get how you detected

35:40.265 --> 35:42.924
the tap we put on the SD-6
network last year.

35:43.032 --> 35:45.657
Yes, that was a noble attempt,
gentlemen.

35:45.766 --> 35:47.264
What happened was

35:47.265 --> 35:49.564
it was interfering
with my Dungeon Master game.

35:49.565 --> 35:52.724
My gnome kept skipping a frame
every time he swung his ax.

35:54.832 --> 35:56.798
Oh, my God.
My first phone call.

35:56.799 --> 35:58.464
Excuse me.

35:58.465 --> 35:59.765
This is Marshall.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.131
Marshall, it's me.

36:01.132 --> 36:02.798
I need you to run a trace

36:02.799 --> 36:05.697
on every incoming call made to
the phone I'm talking to you on.

36:05.799 --> 36:08.299
Sure, Syd.
No problem.

36:08.465 --> 36:12.124
I need you to scroll to the
incoming-call menu on the phone

36:12.233 --> 36:14.298
and then hit pound, pound,
then send.

36:14.299 --> 36:16.799
Okay, hold on.

36:19.266 --> 36:21.165
Okay, I'm getting 15 locations.

36:21.166 --> 36:23.598
- Any of them in Zurich?
- Uh, two.

36:23.599 --> 36:25.664
The first one was made
from a pay phone at the airport.

36:25.665 --> 36:26.998
No good. Next.

36:26.999 --> 36:28.365
Made from a cellphone.

36:28.366 --> 36:30.731
I can triangulate
the location if it's on.

36:30.732 --> 36:32.865
I got it!
It's moving!

36:32.866 --> 36:33.865
Where is it?

36:33.866 --> 36:36.764
Looks like the Amcorp Bank
on New Market Street.

36:36.866 --> 36:37.998
I'll call you back.

36:37.999 --> 36:40.499
We're going
to New Market Street.

36:50.266 --> 36:52.766
- We're on Burgstrasse.
- The robbery is in progress.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.332
- Are you copying my signal?
- Send all available units.

36:54.333 --> 36:56.365
I got you.
Make a right at the next light.

36:56.366 --> 36:58.866
Hold on.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.532
Mr. Skopic, welcome.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.657
I'm Claude Sheurer,
President of Amcorp Bank.

37:26.767 --> 37:30.096
Thank you for accommodating me
on such short notice.

37:30.200 --> 37:31.565
Not at all.

37:31.566 --> 37:34.293
$50 million in cash
is not the kind of thing

37:34.434 --> 37:37.332
one likes to leave under
one's pillow for very long.

37:37.434 --> 37:40.025
This is our bank manager,
Peter Kunz.

37:40.167 --> 37:40.732
Hello.

37:40.733 --> 37:41.732
Pleasure.

37:41.733 --> 37:44.324
He will take you to our vault
while I secure your deposit.

37:44.434 --> 37:46.934
Good. Good.

37:52.867 --> 37:54.633
Can we offer you an espresso?

37:54.634 --> 37:57.134
No, thank you very much.
You are most kind.

37:57.169 --> 37:59.066
But due
to a sensitive stomach,

37:59.067 --> 38:02.157
my physician has prohibited
caffeine from my diet.

38:02.267 --> 38:03.366
Very well.

38:03.367 --> 38:05.867
After you.

38:07.567 --> 38:10.226
I've spliced into
the face-recognition database.

38:13.467 --> 38:15.967
You've cleared their system.

38:23.567 --> 38:26.397
I'll need 10 seconds.
Keep him talking longer.

38:26.501 --> 38:28.833
Herr Kunz,
May I ask you something?

38:28.834 --> 38:30.733
This American war on terrorism.

38:30.734 --> 38:34.222
Has it affected your procedure
in any way at all?

38:34.335 --> 38:37.199
Looping the feed now.

38:37.301 --> 38:39.892
I assure you, our institution

38:40.035 --> 38:42.535
is one of the most secure
in the world.

38:47.301 --> 38:49.801
Box 4747.

38:58.801 --> 39:01.301
Okay, take a left
into the alley.

39:03.602 --> 39:06.761
I guess it's pointless to say
we should wait for backup.

39:08.101 --> 39:09.868
Sydney, you're going too fast.

39:09.869 --> 39:12.369
Sydney!

39:40.236 --> 39:42.001
Who's in charge?

39:42.002 --> 39:43.768
What can I do for you?

39:43.769 --> 39:46.996
Lock down your vault.
You're being robbed.

39:48.169 --> 39:50.669
I think you're mistaken.

39:56.702 --> 39:59.202
It's looped.
That's him.

40:02.935 --> 40:04.268
Sydney's in the lobby.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.769
She's by the entrance.

40:15.736 --> 40:18.236
Sloane!

40:19.836 --> 40:22.336
Hold your fire!

40:22.436 --> 40:24.936
Get down!

40:32.369 --> 40:34.869
I warned you, Sydney.

40:35.836 --> 40:38.529
I can't guarantee your safety
in a situation like this.

40:38.636 --> 40:41.329
There is no way I'm letting
you out of here.

40:43.469 --> 40:44.935
Ah.

40:44.936 --> 40:48.698
You must be the man
that Sark told me about.

40:48.803 --> 40:51.269
The man that Sydney
was willing to kill me for.

40:51.270 --> 40:53.236
She would've killed you
for a lot less.

40:53.237 --> 40:56.361
The police are on their way.
We have Caplan's family.

40:56.503 --> 40:57.769
Give up!

40:57.770 --> 40:59.902
We've rigged the lower level
with enough C-4

40:59.903 --> 41:01.668
to level the entire city block.

41:01.669 --> 41:04.169
So if we don't walk
out of here...

41:06.570 --> 41:09.070
nobody does.

41:15.771 --> 41:18.271
You're bluffing.

41:22.604 --> 41:25.536
I'm not the only one
carrying a remote trigger.

41:25.637 --> 41:28.330
The entire bank is monitored
via satellite

41:28.470 --> 41:30.169
by an off-site team.

41:30.170 --> 41:34.261
If they don't see me
walk out of here in...

41:34.370 --> 41:36.403
30 seconds...

41:36.404 --> 41:38.904
they'll detonate.

41:39.270 --> 41:42.168
So I suggest that you both
lower your guns.

41:47.504 --> 41:51.027
Lower your guns.

42:06.971 --> 42:09.471
Toss them on the ground.

42:14.304 --> 42:16.804
You, my dear...

42:18.705 --> 42:21.205
...you'll be driving me
out of here.
