Marie's getting photos
in of me hitting Danny.

00:02.344 --> 00:03.787
She's gonna know
it's me.

00:05.780 --> 00:07.365
That bitch is out there
somewhere

00:07.591 --> 00:09.802
and she's destroyed
my fuckin' life.

00:09.890 --> 00:11.740
Ferguson is still here?

00:11.874 --> 00:13.467
It came through
ten minutes ago.

00:13.942 --> 00:15.961
We've got no choice now,
we have to pay the money.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.162
- Information's power. Everywhere.
- In here.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.910
Got a lot of enemies, Rita.
How do you think I control them?

00:20.998 --> 00:22.777
You got, like,
dirt files or somethin'?

00:22.864 --> 00:24.568
Yeah, that's exactly
what I got.

00:25.539 --> 00:26.966
I didn't bash Cherry.

00:27.123 --> 00:29.255
Liz Birdsworth
has got the dementia.

00:29.343 --> 00:30.779
You need to stay away
from Kaz.

00:30.873 --> 00:32.201
I think she's gonna
try and come for you.

00:32.287 --> 00:34.568
- She's already tried once.
- She poisoned me?

00:34.656 --> 00:36.638
If I wasn't getting outta here,

00:36.726 --> 00:38.963
I would slit your
fucking throat.

00:39.071 --> 00:41.287
Kaz is your best friend and
you picked Marie over her.

00:41.511 --> 00:43.232
I can't trust ya.
We're done.

00:43.508 --> 00:44.966
Chamberlain,
the doctor you assaulted,

00:45.054 --> 00:45.920
he dropped dead.

00:46.008 --> 00:47.623
What are my chances
of being convicted?

00:47.711 --> 00:48.818
You're fucked.

Looks like
the tip-off was good.

Sierra 2, this is Sierra 6.

02:01.378 --> 02:03.136
I'm escorting the
detectives now.

02:05.656 --> 02:07.151
Thank you, Sierra 6.

02:07.373 --> 02:08.773
Why are they back?

02:12.439 --> 02:14.205
You have to chair
the staff meeting.

02:14.831 --> 02:15.964
Sure.

02:16.375 --> 02:18.199
OK, go on,
get outta here.

02:25.443 --> 02:26.946
- Governor.
- Mmm.

02:27.518 --> 02:29.870
Thank you, Miss Miles,
you can close the door.

02:32.497 --> 02:33.697
Take a seat.

02:33.932 --> 02:35.374
What can I do for you?

02:35.739 --> 02:37.254
We found a body...

02:37.627 --> 02:39.397
last night, after a tip-off.

02:39.900 --> 02:41.632
We believe
it's Joan Ferguson.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.060
What?

02:44.511 --> 02:46.284
W... Joan Ferguson?

02:46.391 --> 02:49.239
Forensics should be able to
confirm the ID in the next few days.

02:53.245 --> 02:55.985
Now, the body is roughly
the right height and build,

02:56.073 --> 02:58.171
and dressed in a
Wentworth issue tracksuit.

03:00.804 --> 03:03.227
It was buried in one
of your workshop boxes,

03:03.336 --> 03:05.720
the same type Ferguson
and Doyle used to escape.

03:07.722 --> 03:08.922
Right.

03:09.576 --> 03:11.698
Bloodied scratch marks inside the box

03:11.786 --> 03:14.220
indicate that she was buried alive.

03:15.739 --> 03:17.334
The implications are clear.

03:18.001 --> 03:19.696
It appears someone in your staff

03:19.784 --> 03:21.076
may have assisted Ferguson

03:21.171 --> 03:22.502
- and then murdered her.
- Well, that's impossible.

03:22.589 --> 03:24.999
- Where'd your tip-off come from?
- Anonymous.

03:25.968 --> 03:28.796
All of your officers will
need to be re-interviewed.

03:29.381 --> 03:31.074
We'll get started immediately.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.422
Yeah, of course.
Certainly.

03:37.795 --> 03:39.004
We're fucked!

03:39.091 --> 03:40.801
We are
if you don't calm down.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.102
You two need to get
your stories straight.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.750
Do you know where
the tip-off came from?

03:44.848 --> 03:46.978
It's got to be the same
person who's blackmailing us.

03:47.065 --> 03:49.656
This was a warning.
Punishment for last night.

03:49.923 --> 03:51.745
Have they sent
any other messages?

03:53.139 --> 03:55.674
Well, you need to get in touch with
them before they shop us to police.

03:55.761 --> 03:58.095
Do not tell me what to do!

04:09.395 --> 04:10.615
So, now what?

04:12.439 --> 04:15.170
Marie Winter has her
dirt file here, in prison.

04:15.257 --> 04:18.178
Once I get a hold of it,
we won't just nail her protector,

04:18.266 --> 04:20.290
we'll have
her entire network.

04:20.771 --> 04:22.887
Well, good, 'cause that's your job.

04:22.974 --> 04:25.345
- There's a few things I want done first.
- What do ya mean?

04:25.466 --> 04:27.907
Susan Jenkins was charged
with Cherry Li's bashing...

04:27.995 --> 04:30.111
- So?
- Dragovic did that,

04:30.208 --> 04:32.390
so you're going to get
Jenkins' charges dropped

04:32.641 --> 04:35.220
and I want Ruby Mitchell
transferred out of Wentworth.

04:35.357 --> 04:37.191
What-what-what-what's
she got to do with it?

04:38.828 --> 04:40.028
Nothin'.

04:40.506 --> 04:42.620
She's my sister and
I need to protect her.

04:42.833 --> 04:45.843
You gotta be kidding me.
Your sister is an inmate?

04:47.095 --> 04:48.126
Yes.

04:48.251 --> 04:49.337
Oh, this is bullshit.

04:49.425 --> 04:51.171
You've had split focus
this whole time.

04:51.259 --> 04:52.851
You have no fucking idea
what I've been through.

04:52.938 --> 04:54.391
Just do this for me!

04:56.921 --> 04:58.562
You want to finish the job, yeah?

04:58.657 --> 05:01.355
You want the glory, the promotion
and the pay rise, of course you do.

05:01.442 --> 05:02.936
So, get my sister out of here!

05:15.886 --> 05:17.878
Er, when is the championship?

05:18.524 --> 05:19.850
In a few months.

05:20.231 --> 05:21.431
When I get out.

05:24.234 --> 05:26.306
I dunno if I'll ever get out, eh?

05:26.394 --> 05:28.477
Thanks to Cherry fucking Li.

05:28.565 --> 05:31.360
Hey, it wasn't her fault
that she got bashed.

05:36.999 --> 05:39.347
Oi, no!
Stop distractin' her, all right?

05:39.434 --> 05:42.657
She's got a new bestie
now, so see ya. Bye-bye.

05:43.101 --> 05:44.999
Keep punchin'.
Come on, sis.

05:46.108 --> 05:47.616
Ooh, whoa.

05:50.919 --> 05:52.244
Fuck!

05:55.030 --> 05:56.319
What's wrong?

05:56.662 --> 05:58.431
- Hey? No, I'm gonna...
- Just give me a minute, Boomer.

05:58.534 --> 05:59.836
- Just give me a fucking minute!
- I'm... All right!

05:59.923 --> 06:02.165
- Hey, hey. We'll go for a walk. Come on.
- OK.

06:02.253 --> 06:03.453
Come on.

06:10.365 --> 06:11.565
Hey?!

06:12.333 --> 06:13.584
Come over here.

06:13.732 --> 06:16.376
Five grand and I'll
fight whoever you want.

06:16.464 --> 06:17.669
Five grand?

06:17.848 --> 06:19.357
You'll get your money's worth.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.837
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.079
Kosta...

06:25.855 --> 06:28.243
I don't want Rita finding
out about it, all right?

06:42.800 --> 06:44.000
Connors?

06:44.228 --> 06:45.401
Just returnin' a book.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.528
You're due in medical,
random drug test.

06:47.839 --> 06:49.039
Sure.

07:01.949 --> 07:03.148
Thank you, Mr Stewart.

07:03.235 --> 07:05.346
Uh, the police have asked
to use a second office.

07:05.434 --> 07:06.775
- You OK with that?
- Just give them whatever they want.

07:06.862 --> 07:07.987
Take a seat, Proctor.

07:08.090 --> 07:10.697
Ah, thanks, but I've been sitting
on my butt for the last 24 hours.

07:10.784 --> 07:12.759
- What are the cops doing here?
- Nothing that concerns you.

07:12.846 --> 07:14.535
I want to talk about
Marie Winter.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.730
You're gonna have to ask her
what happened, I mean,

07:16.817 --> 07:18.069
she wasn't very happy.

07:18.156 --> 07:20.104
Right,
was it a fight, or a challenge?

07:20.192 --> 07:22.572
Why would she challenge me?
She's walking out the door in a minute.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.010
Yeah, maybe not.

07:24.687 --> 07:26.858
Her assault victim died
of his injuries

07:27.008 --> 07:29.370
so she is now facing
manslaughter charges.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.432
Right.

07:31.987 --> 07:33.682
Now this makes sense.

07:33.987 --> 07:37.902
Trust me, you do not want that
piece of work in charge of our women.

07:38.350 --> 07:40.336
Do you have enough
support to keep control?

07:41.396 --> 07:42.596
Yeah...

07:42.801 --> 07:44.006
I think so.

07:44.552 --> 07:47.268
But you know this place,
they gave Joan Ferguson the job.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.987
I think you're good
for the women, Kaz...

07:52.211 --> 07:55.389
and the last thing I need
right now is more instability.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.657
I would like to help you
if I can.

07:58.625 --> 07:59.825
Will,

08:00.266 --> 08:03.307
I want you to release Proctor back
into General first thing tomorrow.

08:03.411 --> 08:05.541
- What about Winter?
- Well, you keep her in the slot.

08:05.629 --> 08:07.136
Well, we don't know
who started the fight.

08:07.223 --> 08:08.903
I've reviewed the
CCTV

08:08.999 --> 08:11.059
and I think 
Proctor was defending herself.

08:11.464 --> 08:14.799
If she gets out first,
she's got time to shore up support.

08:14.910 --> 08:16.844
I do not want Marie Winter
in control.

08:16.932 --> 08:19.383
At least with Proctor,
I know where we stand.

08:19.515 --> 08:20.638
Ms Bennett...

08:20.726 --> 08:23.431
- Oh, have you got everything you need?
- Yes, thank you.

08:23.768 --> 08:26.090
I've scheduled your interview
for tomorrow afternoon.

08:27.421 --> 08:28.832
You, too, Mr Jackson.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.612
Right, we're happy to help.

08:42.221 --> 08:44.049
- Oh, piss off!
- Hm.

08:49.323 --> 08:50.581
What ya up to?

08:50.669 --> 08:54.155
Oh, well, this is...
this is my memory box.

08:54.243 --> 08:56.810
So, these are all little memories

08:56.897 --> 08:59.081
and I write 'em down
so I don't forget 'em.

08:59.174 --> 09:01.836
- Oh, yeah? 'Cause...
- Yeah.

09:02.874 --> 09:05.367
The woman... yarn bogged...

09:05.520 --> 09:08.723
- What the...? Bombed.
- Bombed... yarn bombed.

09:08.956 --> 09:12.063
- Yarn bombed... the yard for me.
- Mmm.

09:12.172 --> 09:13.635
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

09:14.253 --> 09:15.335
Go in there?

09:15.422 --> 09:17.643
- Yeah, yeah.
- What's that one?

09:17.731 --> 09:19.807
Oh, that one... uh...

09:19.961 --> 09:23.561
oh, "Boomer tried to teach
baby Josh to say, 'tits'."

09:23.648 --> 09:25.753
Oh, yeah.

09:27.527 --> 09:30.049
- Tits!
- Tits! Tits!

09:30.137 --> 09:34.040
- Dors was so pissed off at me.
- Oh. Yeah, she was, she was.

09:34.128 --> 09:36.776
- Wasn't she?
- Yeah. Oh, do another.

09:36.892 --> 09:38.768
- Huh? Oh.
- Do another.

09:38.878 --> 09:43.307
Um... Oh, "Bea's first
day. She was scared stiff.

09:43.471 --> 09:46.323
I tried to look after
her." And a little picture.

09:46.799 --> 09:48.538
Yeah. Yeah.

09:51.050 --> 09:52.455
I miss her.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.132
Yeah, me, too.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.689
And Franky...
and Maxie...

09:58.197 --> 10:00.768
and Dors.
And, oh, God...

10:02.761 --> 10:04.791
sometimes I feel like
the whole world's

10:04.878 --> 10:07.904
just moving past me and
I'm just standin' still.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.582
I know that feeling, love.

10:12.493 --> 10:14.055
You seem normal again.

10:14.286 --> 10:17.476
Well, sometimes I'm OK, Booms,
and then sometimes I'm not.

10:17.563 --> 10:21.024
So, I have to... oh, just take
it one day at a time, you know?

10:22.738 --> 10:24.647
Jenkins,
Governor wants to see you.

10:24.836 --> 10:26.036
What?!

10:26.454 --> 10:27.592
Oh, fuckin' why?

10:27.679 --> 10:30.065
- Am I in the shit again, am I?
- Probably.

10:30.817 --> 10:32.223
Fucking hell!

10:37.403 --> 10:38.787
Give this to Marie.

10:39.378 --> 10:41.172
- What?
- You peer worker,

10:41.260 --> 10:43.370
so go see her, give her this.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.276
- I don't think I can be peer worker...
- Fuckin' do it!

10:46.363 --> 10:48.951
It's too late in the day
now to... go...

10:49.638 --> 10:52.362
- First thing tomorrow, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:56.459 --> 10:57.672
Yeah.

10:57.759 --> 10:59.568
First thing in the morning, I...

11:01.448 --> 11:02.875
Oh, God.

11:16.263 --> 11:17.463
Dinner.

11:20.343 --> 11:21.711
Thanks.

11:38.446 --> 11:41.727
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm itching to get out.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.178
Need some
information to control him.

11:46.265 --> 11:47.848
Heard you might help out.

11:47.961 --> 11:50.086
Well, maybe you should
stop picking fights.

11:51.065 --> 11:52.365
Why did you do it?

11:52.754 --> 11:54.394
Why, do you want to
take over? Is that it?

11:54.492 --> 11:57.376
Oh, come on, you officers have
no idea what goes on in here.

11:57.626 --> 11:58.826
So, tell me.

12:01.932 --> 12:03.132
Listen...

12:03.791 --> 12:06.743
if you want to survive in here,
you've got to keep your head down.

12:07.328 --> 12:09.344
Being Top Dog invites trouble.

12:12.494 --> 12:14.381
I'll get you outta
here as soon as I can.

12:16.311 --> 12:17.511
Thanks.

12:19.123 --> 12:22.131
Oh, uh, by the way,
Connors was in your cell.

12:23.579 --> 12:24.698
Doing what?

12:24.786 --> 12:27.601
Well, she said she was returning
a book, is that...? Was she legit?

12:28.495 --> 12:29.786
Which book?

12:30.287 --> 12:33.407
Uh, I dunno, it was, uh...
pretty chunky, blue spine.

12:33.494 --> 12:35.621
Oh, no, forget about
that, it's no worries.

12:35.834 --> 12:36.992
OK.

12:37.249 --> 12:38.530
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:50.251 --> 12:52.923
Oh, fucking Rita!

13:10.089 --> 13:12.534
- Governor, Jenkins to see you.
- Thank you, Miss Miles.

13:17.418 --> 13:18.618
Yeah?

13:18.801 --> 13:21.034
You might wanna
be sitting for this.

13:26.878 --> 13:29.534
I just got off the phone
from the DPP.

13:30.624 --> 13:33.726
Your charges for the assault
on Cherry I. have been dropped.

13:34.691 --> 13:35.891
What?

13:36.145 --> 13:37.345
Mm-hm.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.565
Oh, that's...

13:40.106 --> 13:41.628
that's awesome.

13:41.805 --> 13:43.531
Oh!

13:43.846 --> 13:46.977
Oh, my God. What strings
did you have to pull, eh?

13:47.064 --> 13:49.112
No strings.
Lack of forensic evidence.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.718
- Yeah, lack of forensics!
- OK. OK, great. No, it's all right.

13:51.806 --> 13:54.598
- It's good. Sit. Sit.
- Yeah.

13:54.774 --> 13:58.712
- So, given your parole is coming up...
- Mmm...

13:58.850 --> 14:00.342
I expect you to be on
your best behaviour.

14:00.429 --> 14:02.000
- No more announcements.
- Nah.

14:02.087 --> 14:03.841
Nah, you've got nothin'
to worry about, Ms Bennett.

14:03.929 --> 14:06.220
- I'm...
- OK. OK.

14:06.368 --> 14:07.759
Miss Miles?

14:10.647 --> 14:12.052
- Oh, can I go now? Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:12.139 --> 14:15.438
- I'm gettin' parole. I'm getting parole!
- Really?

16:04.143 --> 16:05.343
Hello?

16:21.665 --> 16:22.939
Hello, Vera.

16:27.549 --> 16:28.919
Oh, that's better.

16:29.223 --> 16:30.439
Feet are killing me.

16:33.807 --> 16:35.275
For the recycling.

16:37.949 --> 16:39.149
How you been?

16:39.300 --> 16:41.126
Why are you doing this?

16:41.214 --> 16:42.526
Really liked that job.

16:42.614 --> 16:45.557
- You were terrible at it.
- Could have been friends, Vera.

16:46.820 --> 16:48.268
Pity it turned out that way.

16:48.356 --> 16:50.670
So, it is a revenge
thing? Petty revenge.

16:50.758 --> 16:52.572
500 grand is not petty.

16:52.899 --> 16:54.291
That'd set me up nicely.

16:59.006 --> 17:00.408
D'you like the magpie?

17:01.161 --> 17:02.924
Found it in the park.

17:04.275 --> 17:06.674
The gloves and the
epaulettes... what a cack!

17:06.884 --> 17:08.400
Bet you shat yourself.

17:08.686 --> 17:10.932
- You broke into my home.
- Where's the money?

17:11.178 --> 17:15.143
- I don't have 500 grand.
- Come on, Vera.

17:15.290 --> 17:17.598
What's a spinster like you
gonna spend your cash on?

17:18.061 --> 17:20.936
Besides, everyone knows that
bitch mother left you a house.

17:24.663 --> 17:26.140
Pay up...

17:27.214 --> 17:30.050
or the photo goes to the
papers and the police.

17:31.940 --> 17:34.659
I'll get you what I can,
but I need time.

17:34.847 --> 17:36.816
I give you one day,
Vera Bennett.

17:38.746 --> 17:41.014
If you breathe a word
of this to anyone...

17:41.410 --> 17:42.691
you're finished.

17:43.406 --> 17:44.777
Understand?

17:46.683 --> 17:49.894
And that goes for Snaky
Jakey and Dumbfuck Jackson.

17:51.356 --> 17:53.358
From now on,
this is between you and me.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.546
And how do I know
this'll be the end of it?

17:56.756 --> 17:57.987
Well, you don't.

17:58.075 --> 17:59.765
You have to take
my word for it.

18:03.363 --> 18:05.013
See you tomorrow night.

18:15.965 --> 18:18.750
That's the sound of your
chickens coming home to roost.

18:23.292 --> 18:24.516
<i>Hello?</i>

18:25.159 --> 18:27.554
Good news, uncle.
Gotta present for ya.

18:27.841 --> 18:30.067
<i>Oh!
Is it what I asked for?</i>

18:30.155 --> 18:31.666
Course it is.
You'll love it.

18:31.874 --> 18:33.296
How's things with you mob?

18:33.521 --> 18:35.131
House search goin' OK?

18:35.326 --> 18:38.084
<i>Yeah, good.
The application's with the agent.</i>

18:38.172 --> 18:41.282
Great. I know how impatient
your sister can get.

18:42.092 --> 18:44.781
- <i>All right, we'll be in touch.</i>
- Sure.

18:53.820 --> 18:56.224
Governor, the detectives want
to interview me this morning,

18:56.297 --> 18:58.637
- do you know what it is about?
- Well, you'll have to ask them.

18:58.724 --> 19:00.952
Can you action Ruby
Mitchell's transfer papers?

19:01.047 --> 19:02.146
Yep.

19:05.772 --> 19:07.123
D'you get a reply yet?

19:09.212 --> 19:10.552
Vera?

19:11.896 --> 19:13.709
If there is any news...

19:13.845 --> 19:15.252
you will hear it.

19:25.822 --> 19:28.457
Hey, Fight Cub's on this arvo.

19:28.861 --> 19:30.079
Five K?

19:30.182 --> 19:32.475
Got some big bets
coming in from outside.

19:32.668 --> 19:34.075
Put up a good fight.

19:34.878 --> 19:36.404
I always do.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.637
- Governor.
- Yes, how's it going?

19:52.334 --> 19:54.110
We've got some fresh intel.

19:54.967 --> 19:56.904
A Corrections Department vehicle

19:56.992 --> 19:59.700
was caught on a traffic
camera near the burial site

19:59.788 --> 20:02.638
the night of the escape.
It's registered to this prison.

20:03.229 --> 20:05.615
We believe it was used
to transport Ferguson

20:05.703 --> 20:07.481
and that the driver is
her accomplice.

20:07.777 --> 20:09.107
Uh, who was the driver?

20:09.195 --> 20:11.697
Well, that's unclear.
We're cross-referencing staff rosters

20:11.785 --> 20:13.305
but we're also presuming
the accomplice

20:13.417 --> 20:14.972
- could've slipped out while on shift.
- Mm.

20:15.059 --> 20:19.042
So, we need access to CCTV
covering all vehicle garages.

20:19.129 --> 20:20.396
Yeah, of course.

20:20.993 --> 20:22.779
Now, please.

20:26.805 --> 20:28.070
Dragovic.

20:31.170 --> 20:32.912
You still interested in Ruby Mitchell?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.915
- Yeah.
- How interested?

20:35.811 --> 20:37.946
- 20 bucks.
- Hundred.

20:38.810 --> 20:39.856
Mm.

20:39.951 --> 20:42.652
Transfer application's come
in to send her to Barnhurst.

20:42.786 --> 20:44.129
- When?
- Dunno.

20:44.217 --> 20:46.303
Came from outside
Corrections, which is weird.

20:46.459 --> 20:47.792
Could be as early as tomorrow.

20:47.879 --> 20:50.772
- Sierra 6, this is Sierra 1.
- This is Sierra 6, go ahead.

20:50.859 --> 20:53.251
- Your assistance is required...
- Hey!

20:54.074 --> 20:56.299
- You deliver the message?
- What?

20:56.394 --> 20:58.392
The message for Marie!

20:58.479 --> 20:59.784
Liz?

20:59.909 --> 21:01.109
Uh...

21:04.825 --> 21:06.147
What'd she want?

21:07.042 --> 21:08.335
I dunno.

21:09.162 --> 21:11.987
Hey, now that the cops
have dropped the charges...

21:12.075 --> 21:15.133
maybe I can come
watch you box in Malilla, hey?

21:15.221 --> 21:17.357
- "Manila."
- Yeah.

21:17.945 --> 21:22.707
- Can...? Fuckin' ringside, cool. Fun!
- I'll save you a seat ringside, then.

21:23.863 --> 21:25.462
Hey, I'm gettin' out now.

21:25.819 --> 21:29.209
- Great. Happy for ya.
- Thanks. Oh, sweet.

21:29.297 --> 21:30.937
What are you going to
do when you get out?

21:31.154 --> 21:33.923
Hey, Drago,
you betting on the fight?

21:34.544 --> 21:37.208
Ruth versus Ruby.
It's gonna be a good one.

21:37.618 --> 21:39.357
Ruth's fighting Mitchell?

21:39.638 --> 21:40.838
Yeah.

21:42.190 --> 21:43.390
Yeah.

21:46.605 --> 21:48.433
- Yeah.
- Plan soon...

21:50.124 --> 21:52.143
So, you need to go into
Archive...

21:53.917 --> 21:55.761
and, ah, click on the cameras
you want.

21:55.938 --> 21:57.846
All garages and entrances.

21:58.374 --> 22:01.197
Um, the date in that search box...

22:02.549 --> 22:05.468
and, uh,
a start and end time.

22:14.873 --> 22:16.138
Hm.

22:17.178 --> 22:18.841
Um, let me try.

22:28.020 --> 22:29.444
Nothing there.

22:29.536 --> 22:32.076
- No.
- Surely you got a backup.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.160
No backup data found.

22:42.863 --> 22:46.134
So, all camera logs for
that date have been erased?

22:47.088 --> 22:48.619
Well, it appears so.

22:52.642 --> 22:55.158
Who'd have access
to those logs?

22:57.372 --> 23:00.970
I panicked. After Channing
came in, I ju... just panicked.

23:01.114 --> 23:02.723
Jesus Christ!

23:02.810 --> 23:04.914
You realise
what you have done?

23:05.116 --> 23:06.365
They are onto us now.

23:06.453 --> 23:09.955
They know only senior officers
could access that footage.

23:11.574 --> 23:13.064
It's circumstantial.

23:14.233 --> 23:16.918
So, we stay calm and
stick to our stories.

23:17.324 --> 23:20.119
The only person with evidence
is whoever took that photo.

23:28.821 --> 23:30.088
Hey?!

23:31.368 --> 23:33.905
- Could I talk to you about Ruby?
- Yeah.

23:34.016 --> 23:36.375
I don't understand why
she called things off.

23:36.463 --> 23:37.485
Have you talked to her?

23:37.573 --> 23:39.875
Yeah, I've tried,
but she gives me nothing.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.383
I'm sorry, Allie.

23:41.610 --> 23:44.119
But... could you talk to her?

23:44.275 --> 23:46.531
You know what she's like
when she makes her mind up...

23:46.683 --> 23:48.765
I just wanna understand
what happened.

23:49.534 --> 23:51.011
Please, could you try?

23:53.240 --> 23:54.451
Sure.

24:09.459 --> 24:12.058
- What d'you want?
- Shut the fuck up!

24:12.313 --> 24:13.703
Argh!

24:14.186 --> 24:15.386
Fuck!

24:17.064 --> 24:19.477
Hey, what the fuck are
you doing?! Let me out!

24:19.565 --> 24:23.077
You thought you were so fucking
clever getting rid of that photo.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.543
Now I know your sister killed Danny.

24:26.645 --> 24:28.844
And I'm going to fucking
kill her...

24:29.089 --> 24:30.430
for Marie.

24:30.518 --> 24:33.110
Let me out!
Let me out!

24:42.256 --> 24:44.578
Hey, let me out!

24:44.690 --> 24:45.890
Fuck!

25:27.036 --> 25:28.155
Vera Bennett.

25:28.266 --> 25:31.079
The police wanna
talk to him. Where are you?

25:31.245 --> 25:33.339
I just ducked out to
get something to eat.

25:33.464 --> 25:35.570
Well, they want to
interview us after lunch.

25:35.929 --> 25:37.129
OK.

25:37.785 --> 25:39.347
I'm on my way back now.

25:59.277 --> 26:01.297
We weren't aware
you'd left the prison.

26:01.488 --> 26:02.830
I'm sorry...

26:02.993 --> 26:05.092
I wasn't aware
I had to tell you.

26:05.204 --> 26:07.790
You should keep us appraised
of your movements from now on.

26:09.323 --> 26:11.042
Why, am I a suspect?

26:14.352 --> 26:18.050
We've already established Ferguson's
accomplice was a senior officer.

26:21.216 --> 26:23.331
And you're accusing me?

26:24.420 --> 26:26.466
We can discuss that
during your interview.

26:45.445 --> 26:47.342
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:49.096 --> 26:50.259
Have you seen Ruby?

26:50.347 --> 26:52.280
Well, she's probably
gettin' ready for the fight.

26:52.368 --> 26:53.663
What fight?

27:07.358 --> 27:08.558
Rita?!

27:08.710 --> 27:10.938
- Hey!
- I'm in here.

27:12.861 --> 27:14.061
Shit.

27:16.768 --> 27:18.486
- Fuck! Shit!
- What happened?

27:18.573 --> 27:20.414
Drago. Where's Ruby?

27:20.792 --> 27:24.032
- Fight Club.
- Oh, f...!

27:24.698 --> 27:27.637
So, do you, like, need a
water or an OJ or somethin'?

27:27.725 --> 27:28.563
No, no, no, I'm all right.

27:28.658 --> 27:30.506
OK, so we're going to
smash her face in, yeah?

27:30.594 --> 27:32.082
Hey, Ruth's pulled out.

27:32.169 --> 27:33.773
- You're fighting someone else.
- Who?

27:38.321 --> 27:40.610
Oh, shit. Really?

27:41.112 --> 27:42.231
Come on.

27:42.376 --> 27:44.844
- Let's get on with it.
- Ruby?! Wait!

27:45.385 --> 27:47.101
Nuh, nuh, nuh.
She don't wanna see you.

27:47.189 --> 27:48.916
Boomer, shut the fuck up!

27:49.034 --> 27:52.141
- The fight's about to start.
- It can wait! Go away.

27:53.710 --> 27:55.743
- I wanna fight.
- Do you wanna die?

27:55.969 --> 27:58.484
- I can beat her.
- I know about your aneurysm.

28:01.118 --> 28:03.298
Drago knows
you killed Danny.

28:03.386 --> 28:05.081
If you go in there...

28:05.618 --> 28:07.243
she's gonna kill you.

28:09.235 --> 28:10.985
I don't give a fuck!

28:12.803 --> 28:15.509
- What do I have to lose?
- You're my sister,

28:16.078 --> 28:17.424
and I love you.

28:17.774 --> 28:19.673
Rube, it's time, come on!

28:22.670 --> 28:24.172
I'm still a cop!

28:25.094 --> 28:26.639
I saw that footage.

28:26.841 --> 28:28.868
I've always known it
was you that killed him.

28:29.513 --> 28:31.267
I came in here
to protect you from Marie

28:31.355 --> 28:34.860
Ru, please...
you cannot do this.

28:47.101 --> 28:50.149
- Who're you goin' on? All right.
- Rubes.

28:50.348 --> 28:52.652
- Who do you want?
- Ruby.

28:52.831 --> 28:54.532
Where the fuck is she?

28:58.151 --> 28:59.790
For Ruby? OK.

29:00.049 --> 29:01.587
What's the hold-up?

29:05.576 --> 29:08.282
Ruby's out.
You're fighting me.

29:08.417 --> 29:09.930
- Bullshit.
- Let's go.

29:10.018 --> 29:13.123
- Hey, but the bets were placed for Ruby.
- Just fuckin' fight!

29:13.211 --> 29:14.501
Come on.

29:35.430 --> 29:36.747
Ugh!

29:36.841 --> 29:39.594
I did not help
Joan Ferguson escape.

29:39.682 --> 29:40.811
So, who did?

29:40.935 --> 29:44.424
We're narrowing down our
suspects, Mr Stewart...

29:48.687 --> 29:50.969
Your service record's clear,

29:51.266 --> 29:53.046
we think that speaks for itself.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.555
The other senior officers, not so much.

29:59.461 --> 30:02.750
Is there anything you can tell
us about Joan Ferguson's escape?

30:03.133 --> 30:04.548
I wish I could.

30:04.731 --> 30:07.008
What's your opinion
of Will Jackson?

30:09.189 --> 30:10.389
He's a good bloke.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.086
He and Ferguson
have history.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.913
Yeah?
So, why would he help her?

30:16.264 --> 30:18.469
Whoever helped her
probably killed her.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.219
Nah, Will hasn't got
the guts for this shit.

30:21.411 --> 30:23.992
And he was on duty.
I-I was with him most of the day.

30:25.870 --> 30:27.703
And what about Governor Bennett?

30:28.268 --> 30:30.289
We know
you two were involved.

30:32.029 --> 30:34.140
You know this prison
inside out.

30:34.228 --> 30:35.937
You know
every staff member.

30:36.105 --> 30:38.123
Some of them... intimately.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.123
You must have a theory.

30:43.867 --> 30:45.922
Argh!

30:46.770 --> 30:48.360
Fucking go!

30:48.703 --> 30:50.821
<i>Ah! Oh, God!</i>

30:51.104 --> 30:53.539
Look, I'll tell you one thing
I know for sure,

30:53.627 --> 30:55.829
Vera Bennett had
nothing to do with this.

30:56.055 --> 30:59.087
Other officers report seeing
both yourself and Mr Stewart

30:59.174 --> 31:01.007
in the prison directly
after the escape,

31:01.094 --> 31:03.211
but no-one remembers
seeing Mr Jackson.

31:03.299 --> 31:05.594
Well, this place was
pandemonium at the time.

31:05.682 --> 31:07.008
That doesn't surprise me.

31:16.420 --> 31:19.256
Oof! Oof! Oof!

31:20.294 --> 31:22.255
Let's talk about Will Jackson.

31:23.864 --> 31:25.912
Fucking what?!

31:27.860 --> 31:29.662
<i>- Argh!
- Ow!</i>

31:29.750 --> 31:32.646
Oh!

31:36.824 --> 31:38.849
Do you remember seeing him?

31:44.051 --> 31:45.987
It's a simple question, Miss Bennett.

31:48.145 --> 31:52.513
Did you see Mr Jackson in
the hours after the escape?

31:55.567 --> 31:56.767
Governor?

32:11.869 --> 32:13.498
Fucking bitch.

32:13.816 --> 32:15.529
Your sister's a coward.

32:20.862 --> 32:22.877
Finish her!

32:35.260 --> 32:37.565
Ruby's dead!

32:40.572 --> 32:42.081
Argh!

33:51.999 --> 33:53.799
- You're Vera Bennett's partner?
- Yeah.

33:53.886 --> 33:55.107
She'll be fine.

33:55.195 --> 33:57.331
Just a few bruises and
a possible concussion.

33:57.497 --> 33:59.823
- I'd like to keep her in for tonight.
- Yeah, sure.

33:59.911 --> 34:02.125
Her main concern was
obviously for the baby,

34:02.213 --> 34:04.117
but there's nothing
to worry about.

34:04.558 --> 34:05.956
You can go through.

34:32.126 --> 34:33.440
You're pregnant?

34:36.533 --> 34:37.728
Is it, um...?

34:37.815 --> 34:40.053
Uh, uh, of... of course it's yours.

34:45.753 --> 34:47.620
I... I don't know
what to say, um...

34:48.866 --> 34:50.277
That's amazing.

34:51.436 --> 34:52.951
I wanna be a proper dad.

34:54.190 --> 34:56.429
I won't let him down. Or her.
I mean, do you know...?

34:56.518 --> 34:59.391
- Are we having a boy or a...?
- There's no "we", Jake.

34:59.492 --> 35:01.263
I'm having this baby on my own.

35:06.466 --> 35:08.243
You don't have to be alone.

35:10.807 --> 35:12.352
We can be a family.

35:12.540 --> 35:14.020
A real family.

35:14.274 --> 35:15.351
Please, just...

35:15.446 --> 35:18.408
think about it.
I know we could make it work.

35:20.330 --> 35:22.110
You know, I was going to punish

35:22.624 --> 35:24.924
this baby for things
you've done?

35:26.503 --> 35:28.516
I swallowed an abortion pill.

35:29.099 --> 35:32.311
I was this close to ending
it and then I realised...

35:33.666 --> 35:35.321
that it's you I hate...

35:37.108 --> 35:39.797
not the baby,
so I threw it up.

35:42.246 --> 35:44.758
You'll never be a part
of this child's life.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.927
Um, I need to be home.

36:14.330 --> 36:17.261
- I can't force you to stay.
- Well, I'll sign anything you want, but,

36:17.348 --> 36:18.840
I have to go.

36:26.744 --> 36:28.148
Any news on Vera?

36:29.949 --> 36:31.013
Yep.

36:31.122 --> 36:33.747
Um, yeah.
She's... she's gonna be OK.

36:33.890 --> 36:35.583
Great. OK.

36:36.367 --> 36:37.935
I'm going in for my interview.

36:38.660 --> 36:40.164
Just stick to your story.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.192
The thing is...

36:43.064 --> 36:44.407
I think I'm done.

36:44.642 --> 36:46.970
This whole fuckin'
mess is because of me.

36:47.099 --> 36:48.866
I think it's time
I just own it.

36:50.170 --> 36:51.602
Tell 'em what I did.

36:52.434 --> 36:53.926
That I acted alone.

36:55.173 --> 36:56.536
You'd protect me and Vera?

36:56.684 --> 36:58.190
I'd protect Vera.

36:59.878 --> 37:02.387
Mr Jackson,
we're ready for you now.

37:51.590 --> 37:52.977
Do you like the bun?

37:53.469 --> 37:55.199
Wore it especially.

37:57.176 --> 37:58.566
I've got the money...

37:58.842 --> 38:00.361
but I want a guarantee.

38:00.488 --> 38:03.261
- This has to be the end of it.
- Whatever you say.

38:03.527 --> 38:05.068
You will get it

38:05.155 --> 38:07.894
when I watch you
delete those pictures.

38:07.982 --> 38:11.055
And I want your phone wiped.
Back to factory settings

38:11.227 --> 38:12.439
in front of me.

38:12.526 --> 38:14.286
You are not getting anything...

38:34.062 --> 38:37.125
I got her. I got her!
I got the bitch!

38:41.086 --> 38:42.286
Oh!

38:43.728 --> 38:45.347
That's not Ferguson.

38:45.727 --> 38:47.965
Who the fuck is that?!

38:50.764 --> 38:54.650
Oh. Oh, fu...

38:55.246 --> 38:58.075
Oh fu... Oh...

38:58.726 --> 38:59.926
Oh.

39:32.739 --> 39:34.494
This is a volatile place.

39:35.157 --> 39:38.047
People take rash choices
all the time, I'm sure.

39:40.776 --> 39:42.252
Is there anything you'd like to tell us

39:42.339 --> 39:45.227
about Joan Ferguson's
escape and subsequent murder?

39:48.615 --> 39:50.935
Shots fired at Vera Bennett's house.
Could be related.

39:51.023 --> 39:54.156
- Is Vera OK?
- She reported it. Let's go.

39:55.808 --> 39:57.837
- What happened?
- I dunno.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.414
- Vera, are you OK?
- It was Channing.

40:01.501 --> 40:03.444
Channing, uh, shot her
right in front of me.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.643
- Shot who?
- Murphy. M-Murphy...

40:05.730 --> 40:08.742
- Murphy was the blackmailer.
- What? Where's Channing now?

40:08.829 --> 40:11.306
Uh, he ran. Uh, the
police have gone after him.

40:11.393 --> 40:14.397
- Right, we're coming over.
- Um I... I have to go.

40:15.884 --> 40:17.084
What?

40:17.215 --> 40:18.536
It was Murphy.

40:20.348 --> 40:21.652
Jesus.

40:23.599 --> 40:25.072
- Wait.
- What?

40:26.736 --> 40:29.027
- There might be a way out of this.
- How?

40:53.688 --> 40:56.017
- I called you hours ago.
- Jesus Christ.

40:56.105 --> 40:57.830
It was self-defence,
get me out of this.

40:58.014 --> 41:00.658
- Where's Winter's file?
- Are you listening to me?!

41:00.893 --> 41:03.546
You never fuckin' had it, did ya?
You strung us along.

41:03.688 --> 41:05.707
You risked blowin' an
entire undercover operation

41:05.794 --> 41:07.111
- for what?
- For my sister!

41:07.199 --> 41:10.615
Yeah, well, no way are
we transferrin' her now.

41:11.576 --> 41:13.194
I can still get the file.

41:14.834 --> 41:18.246
You murdered an inmate.
Who the fuck are you, Connors?

41:18.372 --> 41:20.892
'Cause I dunno any more.
We're callin' it.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.095
- The undercover op is finished.
- No, wait,

41:23.183 --> 41:24.823
- I know where Marie keeps it.
- Too late.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.485
It's not too fuckin' late!

41:26.681 --> 41:28.808
If I get that file, we blow the
lid on the whole bloody thing.

41:28.895 --> 41:31.135
You've been deep cover too
long, you've crossed the line.

41:31.314 --> 41:33.224
You're thinkin' and
actin' like a criminal.

41:33.408 --> 41:34.637
We're cutting you lose.

41:34.724 --> 41:35.918
You can't do that!

41:36.025 --> 41:37.539
You can't leave me here!

41:37.626 --> 41:39.129
You knew
this was off the books.

41:39.216 --> 41:42.486
As of right now,
you are just another prisoner.

41:57.054 --> 42:00.157
