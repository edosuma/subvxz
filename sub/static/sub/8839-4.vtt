01:52.070 --> 01:54.404
[SNORING]

02:22.142 --> 02:24.268
I WAS JUST GOING
TO WAKE YOU.

02:24.435 --> 02:27.771
BROUGHT SOME COFFEE
UP FROM DOWNSTAIRS.
NICE AND HOT.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.691
AFRAID I MIGHT WEAKEN
IF I WENT ACROSS
THE STREET TO THE HOTEL?

02:30.859 --> 02:32.317
OF COURSE NOT.

02:32.485 --> 02:36.446
YOU SURE?
THAT MRS. INGALLS MAKES
THE BEST HOT BISCUITS.

02:36.614 --> 02:39.741
IF YOU WANT
BISCUITS, GO THERE
AND EAT THEM.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.452
I WAS ONLY FOOLING.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.912
I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.914
DRINK YOUR COFFEE
WHILE IT'S HOT.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.207
WHERE'S AMELIA?

02:47.375 --> 02:49.251
SHE'S STARTING THAT
LIVERY SCHOOL TODAY.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.420
THAT'S WHY I GOT UP
SO EARLY.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.964
I KNOW, BUT IT DOESN'T
START TILL 8:00.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.092
I WAS GOING
TO WALK WITH HER
ON MY WAY TO WORK.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.969
SHE'S JUST ANXIOUS,
I GUESS--

02:59.137 --> 03:00.387
HER FIRST CHANCE TO
MEET SOME CHILDREN

03:00.555 --> 03:01.930
SINCE SHE'S BEEN
IN THE CITY.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.891
THE CITY'S FILLED
WITH CHILDREN.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.602
THEY PLAY IN THE STREETS
ALL THE TIME.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.896
SHE SHOULD HAVE
INVITED THEM OVER.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.814
YEAH, I SUPPOSE,
BUT...

03:10.982 --> 03:11.982
SHE'S SHY.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.567
IT'S NOT EASY
FOR HER--

03:13.735 --> 03:17.404
ONLY TWO WEEKS HERE
AND SO MANY PEOPLE.

03:17.572 --> 03:22.451
SHE WASN'T TOO SHY
TO GO TO SCHOOL
BY HERSELF, WAS SHE?

03:28.291 --> 03:31.001
WELL, THE COFFEE
WAS GOOD,

03:31.169 --> 03:34.880
BUT I'M SO FULL,
I COULDN'T SWALLOW
ANOTHER DROP.

03:48.144 --> 03:51.521
LOOK. TWO WEEKS AGO,
THESE WERE TIGHT.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.898
A LITTLE BETTER.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.399
A LOT BETTER.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.109
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T EXPECT IT
JUST TO HAPPEN--

03:56.277 --> 03:59.696
I KNOW. YOU CAN'T
EXPECT A MIRACLE.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.823
TWO WEEKS WITHOUT
ENOUGH FOOD TO KEEP
A BIRD ALIVE,

04:01.991 --> 04:04.743
AND I LOSE WHAT,
A POUND?

04:06.621 --> 04:09.122
WHAT HAPPENS
TO A PERSON?

04:09.290 --> 04:10.540
I DON'T KNOW.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.543
THE DOCTOR
DOESN'T KNOW,
BUT IT HAPPENED,

04:13.711 --> 04:15.045
SO YOU JUST--

04:15.213 --> 04:18.215
SO YOU JUST MAKE
THE BEST OF IT, RIGHT?

04:18.383 --> 04:20.759
RIGHT.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.639
WELL.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.641
I MIGHT AS WELL
GO TO WORK EARLY.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.727
I GOT A LOT
TO DO TODAY.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.355
I GOT MY LUNCH, AND...

04:33.523 --> 04:36.358
IF THERE'S A WORM IN IT,
I PROMISE NOT TO EAT HIM.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.530
I LOVE YOU,
JOHN BEVINS.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.782
I LOVE YOU, BESS.

GOOD MORNING, SMITTY.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.057
I GOT A GOOD ONE
FOR YOU.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.559
THERE'S THIS CABMAN
IN LONDON,

05:10.727 --> 05:12.853
AND HE'S GOT A REAL FAT
LADY IN THE CAB,

05:13.021 --> 05:15.272
AND JUST AS SHE'S
GETTING OUT,

05:15.440 --> 05:17.566
HE SAYS TO HER,
"WOULD YOU MIND

05:17.734 --> 05:20.152
"WALKING THE OTHER WAY
AND NOT PASSING IN FRONT

05:20.320 --> 05:21.445
OF THE HORSE?"

05:21.612 --> 05:23.780
AND SHE SAYS,
"WHY, MAY I ASK?"

05:23.948 --> 05:25.365
"BECAUSE," HE SAYS,

05:25.533 --> 05:27.659
"IF HE SEES WHAT
HE'S BEEN CARRYING

05:27.827 --> 05:30.620
FOR HALF A SHILLING,
HE'LL HAVE A FIT!"

05:30.788 --> 05:33.373
HA HA HA!

05:33.541 --> 05:35.625
A GOOD ONE, HUH?
AIN'T THAT A GOOD ONE?

05:35.793 --> 05:37.419
I GOT TO REMEMBER
THAT ONE.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.545
HA HA HA!

05:38.713 --> 05:40.339
I GOT TO GET
TO WORK, SMITTY.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.842
HA HA HA!
OH, OH, HEY, BEVINS,

05:44.010 --> 05:45.635
WHEN YOU GET
TO THAT BLIND SCHOOL,

05:45.803 --> 05:47.721
BE SURE AND WALK THROUGH
THAT DOOR SIDEWAYS!

05:47.889 --> 05:50.807
I DON'T HAVE
ANY SIDEWAYS!
IT'S A GOOD ONE.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.809
ISN'T THAT A GOOD ONE?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.479
THOMAS, YOU CAN
DO A LOT BETTER
WORK THAN THIS.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.230
YOU'RE NOT
CONCENTRATING.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.190
YES'M.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.232

MR. BEVINS.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.448
I DIDN'T WANT TO
BOTHER YOU DURING CLASS.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.076
I JUST WONDERED IF
THE LOOMS WERE ALL RIGHT.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.994
OH, THE LOOMS
ARE WONDERFUL.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.621

TO DRAW LOTS

06:12.789 --> 06:14.289

USE THEM FIRST.

I'M MAKING, MR. BEVINS.

WELL, THAT'S
VERY GOOD WORK.

BET YOU CAN'T GUESS
WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.261

TO BE A SURPRISE, REMEMBER?

SO KIND AND GOOD TO US.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.665
"HOW DOES A BIRD MAKE
THE NEST SO STRONG, WILLIE?"

09:01.832 --> 09:05.335
"THE MOTHER BIRD HAS
HER BILL AND CLAWS
TO WORK WITH."

09:06.504 --> 09:08.296

ARE YOU GOING
TO WRITE ABOUT?

09:08.464 --> 09:09.631

09:09.799 --> 09:11.216

WRITE MY ESSAY

09:26.148 --> 09:27.357

WE CAN WRITE OUR
ESSAYS TOGETHER.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.781

10:04.312 --> 10:06.271

BUT THE PROBLEM'S THE ROOF.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.316

THROUGH, MAKING
THE WALL SWELL.

ALWAYS SOMETHING.

WELL, IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU GIRLS.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.203
MR. BEVINS.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.123
I CAN FIX THAT ROOF.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.042
I CAN FIX IT
WITHOUT IT COSTING MUCH,

10:27.209 --> 10:28.960
BUT IT'LL JUST
BE TEMPORARY.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.420
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.797
ANY REAL RAINS COME,
IT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN AGAIN.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.176
WE CAN'T AFFORD
A NEW ROOF, SO JUST
DO YOUR BEST.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.677
I WILL.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.306
IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU BOTH.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.435
WELL, YOUNG LADIES,
SHALL WE GO?

10:45.603 --> 10:46.936
NO. I CAN'T.

10:47.104 --> 10:50.106
I JUST REMEMBERED
I HAVE SOME
HOMEWORK TO DO.

10:50.274 --> 10:53.276
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU AT SUPPER.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.861
SEE YOU.
COME ON, CARRIE.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.656
AND WARN YOUR MOTHER,
I'M STARVING!

11:01.243 --> 11:04.579
LAURA, I WANT YOU TO
CHANGE BEFORE YOU HELP.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.164
I WILL, MA.

11:08.125 --> 11:11.503
I JUST WANTED TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT...

11:11.671 --> 11:13.338
ABOUT WHAT?

11:15.633 --> 11:16.841
OH, MA!

11:17.009 --> 11:19.427
OH, THERE, THERE.

11:19.595 --> 11:23.139
OH, WHAT HAPPENED?

11:23.307 --> 11:27.727
COME ON, NOW.
NOTHING CAN BE THAT BAD.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.231
WHAT IS IT?

11:31.399 --> 11:33.566
HMM? WHAT IS IT?

11:33.734 --> 11:36.486
A NEW GIRL CAME
TO SCHOOL TODAY.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.072
HER NAME IS AMELIA.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.907
AFTER SCHOOL,
WE WERE WALKING,

11:41.075 --> 11:44.661
AND WE SAW
THE MAN THAT WORKS
AT THE BLIND SCHOOL.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.746
WE MADE JOKES

11:46.914 --> 11:49.916
ABOUT HIM BEING
FAT AND ALL...

11:50.084 --> 11:52.961
AND HE'S
AMELIA'S FATHER.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.254
OH...

11:54.422 --> 11:55.964
OH, MA, WE
DIDN'T KNOW.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.009
ALL RIGHT, NOW.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.886
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.471
WE JUST
DIDN'T KNOW

12:03.639 --> 12:05.724
THAT HE WAS
HER FATHER.

12:05.891 --> 12:10.103
THE POINT ISN'T
WHETHER YOU KNEW
OR NOT, IS IT?

12:10.271 --> 12:11.771
THE POINT IS THAT
WE SHOULD NEVER

12:11.939 --> 12:14.482
MAKE UNKIND REMARKS
ABOUT ANYONE.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.317
IT WASN'T JUST ME.

12:16.485 --> 12:19.904
OH, YOU KNOW
BETTER THAN TO USE
AN EXCUSE LIKE THAT.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.866
YES, MA'AM. I KNOW.

12:23.033 --> 12:26.661
I'M SURE WHEN YOU SEE
AMELIA TOMORROW,
YOU'LL APOLOGIZE.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.830
WHAT SHOULD I SAY?

12:30.207 --> 12:31.875
YOU THOUGHT
OF THE JOKES.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.627
YOU CAN THINK
OF AN APOLOGY.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.713
YES, MA'AM.

12:36.881 --> 12:37.881
COME ON, NOW.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.258
YOU GO GET CHANGED.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.344
I REALLY
AM SORRY, MA.

12:43.512 --> 12:47.223
THE WAY TO SHOW THAT
IS TO TRY TO NEVER
DO IT AGAIN.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.101
YES, MA'AM.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.495
Bess: AMELIA,
PLEASE STOP CRYING.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.289
Amelia: IF YOU COULD
HAVE HEARD THEM!

13:11.457 --> 13:12.791
THEY DIDN'T KNOW.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.002
NOW, YOU HAVE
TO EXPECT THAT
SOMETIMES FROM PEOPLE.

13:16.170 --> 13:19.172
WHY DID WE HAVE TO MOVE
HERE? I HATE IT HERE!

13:19.340 --> 13:22.258
YOUR FATHER HAD TO FIND
WORK. YOU KNOW THAT.

13:22.426 --> 13:25.011
ON THE FARM,
WE WERE AWAY.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.764
THE CHILDREN
DIDN'T SEE HIM.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.308
NOW, AMELIA,
I'LL NOT HAVE YOU
TALKING LIKE THAT.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.645
YOUR FATHER LOVES YOU.
HE TRIES HIS BEST.

13:33.813 --> 13:38.608
IT'S HARD SOMETIMES,
IN THE BEGINNING,
WHEN PEOPLE FIRST MEET,

13:38.776 --> 13:41.611
BUT AFTER A WHILE,
THEY'LL GET USED TO IT,

13:41.779 --> 13:44.531
AND THEY WON'T
SAY THINGS ANYMORE.

13:44.698 --> 13:47.408
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO MEET MY FRIENDS,

13:47.576 --> 13:50.537
I DON'T WANT THEM
TO SEE HIM,

13:50.704 --> 13:54.082
AND I DON'T WANT THEM
TO KNOW HE'S MY FATHER!

14:20.651 --> 14:22.819
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO STOP CRYING.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.988
John, cheerfully: I'M HOME!

14:25.155 --> 14:26.531
BE RIGHT OUT, JOHN.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.907
HERE.
DRY YOUR EYES.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.784
IS AMELIA HERE?
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR HER.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.953
YES, SHE'S HERE.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.289
NOW, REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.297
HERE.

14:42.464 --> 14:45.884
TO CELEBRATE YOUR
FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.719
THANK YOU, PAPA.

14:49.471 --> 14:53.850
NOW, I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO TELL THE BOTH OF YOU.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.728
I'VE BEEN THINKING
IT OVER, AND I KNOW
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

14:56.896 --> 14:57.896
WHAT IS IT?

14:58.063 --> 15:01.107
WELL, WITH MY SALARY,
AND HAVING TO SPEND

15:01.275 --> 15:03.276
FOR TWO ROOMS
HERE AT THE HOTEL,

15:03.444 --> 15:06.487
IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO
HAVE ANY MONEY LEFT OVER.

15:06.655 --> 15:08.072
WELL,
WE'RE MANAGING.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.741
I KNOW.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.702
BUT IF WE COULD
GET BY ON ONE ROOM,

15:12.870 --> 15:15.163
WE COULD PUT
SOME MONEY AWAY.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.123
WE COULD HAVE
SOME SAVINGS.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.418
WE--WE COULD ALL LIVE
IN ONE ROOM, BUT--

15:20.586 --> 15:22.378
I HAVE THE CHANCE TO WORK
FOR THE RAILROAD.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.590
IT'S MORE MONEY
THAN I GET NOW.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.759
WE COULD SAVE.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.303
YOU'D NOT BE WITH US?

15:30.471 --> 15:33.139
IT'S ONLY
FOR A WHILE, BESS.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.892
THE RENT'S PAID UP
FOR A MONTH.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.645
YOU TWO
COULD SHARE A ROOM.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.773
WHEN WOULD YOU GO?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.900
THEY WANT ME TO LEAVE
RIGHT AWAY.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.320
TONIGHT.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.406
I'D GO TONIGHT.

15:50.574 --> 15:54.285
JOHN, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.954
I'LL FIND WORK SOON.

15:56.121 --> 16:00.541
BESS, PLEASE,
LET ME DO THIS.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.126
PLEASE?

16:05.214 --> 16:06.714
I'LL MISS YOU.

16:11.303 --> 16:15.264
IT'S FOR THE BEST.
YOU WAIT AND SEE.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.283
I WISH YOU'D WAIT
AND TAKE THE STAGE
IN THE MORNING.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.619
IT'S A WASTE
OF MONEY.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.413
I'LL WALK OVER
TO THE DEPOT

16:38.580 --> 16:39.789
AND HITCH A RIDE
ON THE FREIGHT.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.083
BUT IT'S SUCH
A LONG WAY.

16:42.251 --> 16:46.462
BESS? I'M GOING.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.844
YOU LOOK THE SAME,

16:53.012 --> 16:55.972
JUST THE SAME
A THE DAY WE MET.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.765
DO YOU REMEMBER?

16:57.933 --> 17:00.101
YEAH, I REMEMBER,

17:00.269 --> 17:02.812
AND I DON'T LOOK
THE SAME.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.148
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

17:05.315 --> 17:08.693
I WISH I WAS
THE SAME AS THEN.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.863
JUST YOU STOP.

17:12.031 --> 17:16.868
YOU'VE TRIED.
NOBODY COULD HAVE
TRIED HARDER.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.287
I MEAN, WHO CARES?

17:19.455 --> 17:23.458
WHETHER YOU LIKE
TO THINK SO OR NOT,
JOHN BEVINS,

17:23.625 --> 17:26.878
IT WAS NOT LOVE
AT FIRST SIGHT WITH ME.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.173
I FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE MAN INSIDE,

17:30.340 --> 17:33.217
NOT THE MAN
ON THE OUTSIDE.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.471
NOW YOU ALWAYS
REMEMBER THAT.

17:36.638 --> 17:39.515
I WILL.

17:39.683 --> 17:42.310
I'LL ALWAYS
REMEMBER THAT.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.342
BYE, BESS.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.983
JOHN?

19:13.443 --> 19:16.279
MR. AMES.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.865
I DIDN'T EXPECT
ANYBODY WOULD BE UP.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.533
PAPERWORK. I'M ALWAYS
PUTTING IT OFF

19:20.701 --> 19:21.826
TO THE LAST MINUTE.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.327
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
THIS TIME OF NIGHT?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.872
OH. WELL, UH...

19:26.039 --> 19:29.417
I WAS GOING TO SPEAK
TO YOU ABOUT IT
TOMORROW, BUT, UH...

19:30.669 --> 19:32.086
I WONDERED
IF I COULD USE

19:32.254 --> 19:35.131
MY SUPPLY ROOM UPSTAIRS
AS A SLEEPING PLACE.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.841
DON'T YOU
HAVE A PLACE?

19:37.009 --> 19:39.260
I DID, BUT...

19:39.428 --> 19:42.138
THE ONLY FAMILY I HAVE
IS BACK EAST,

19:42.306 --> 19:44.765
AND I FELT I COULD SEND
MORE MONEY BACK TO THEM

19:44.933 --> 19:47.935
IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO
GO ON PAYING FOR A ROOM.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.979
WELL, NOT MUCH
OF A ROOM UP THERE,

19:50.147 --> 19:51.314
FILLED WITH
PAINT CANS AND--

19:51.481 --> 19:55.193
NO, NO. IT'S...
IT'S FINE.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.904
I LIKE IT HERE.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.448
IT'S QUIET HERE,
AND, UH...

20:02.075 --> 20:04.619
AND I FEEL
AT HOME HERE.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.120
PLEASE?

20:06.288 --> 20:08.831
WELL, CERTAINLY,
JOHN, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.625
THANK YOU, SIR.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.126
GOOD NIGHT.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.462
GOOD NIGHT, JOHN.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.851
Laura: AMELIA!

21:11.019 --> 21:12.520
OH, HI, LAURA.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.064
I JUST WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.649
FOR WHAT?

21:16.817 --> 21:20.319
YOU KNOW, THOSE THINGS
WE SAID ABOUT YOUR
FATHER YESTERDAY.

21:20.487 --> 21:21.821
I'M SORRY.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.614
I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

21:23.782 --> 21:27.159
WELL, YOU REMEMBER--
WHEN WE SAW
YOUR PA YESTERDAY.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.912
MY FATHER WORKS
FOR THE RAILROAD.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.124
YOU MEAN HE DOESN'T WORK
FOR THE BLIND SCHOOL?

21:33.292 --> 21:37.086
OH, NO. YOU THOUGHT
THAT WAS MY FATHER?

21:37.254 --> 21:39.964
WELL, HIS NAME IS BEVINS,
AND WHEN YOU RAN OFF,

21:40.132 --> 21:41.799
WELL, THEN,
I JUST FIGURED THAT--

21:41.967 --> 21:43.134
NO. IT WAS JUST
A COINCIDENCE.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.760
MY FATHER DOESN'T
EVEN LIVE HERE.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.263
COME ON.
WE'LL BE LATE.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.390
Amelia: HEY, YOU
WANT TO COME OVER TO
MY PLACE AFTER SCHOOL?

21:49.558 --> 21:51.517
WE CAN WORK
ON OUR ESSAYS.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.728
SURE. ALBERT
HAS TO HELP MY MOM
WITH COOKING.

21:53.895 --> 21:56.731
BOY, AM I GLAD
THAT WASN'T
YOUR PA YESTERDAY.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.274
I FELT AWFUL.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.783
Mary: I GAVE YOU AN EXTRA
15 MINUTES FOR LUNCH,

22:07.951 --> 22:09.827
SO I EXPECT YOU
TO GET RIGHT TO WORK.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.787
MISS INGALLS?

22:11.955 --> 22:13.122
YES, JOHN?

22:13.290 --> 22:16.917
I MADE SOMETHING.
I WANTED YOU
TO HAVE IT.

22:19.671 --> 22:24.133
OH, JOHN.
A...A NECKLACE.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.926
I CARVED ALL
THE BEADS MYSELF.

22:26.094 --> 22:27.887
I PAINTED THEM, TOO.

22:28.055 --> 22:31.807
THANK YOU, JOHN, BUT
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

22:31.975 --> 22:33.434
I WANTED TO.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.190
IT LOOKS PRETTY
ON YOU.

22:41.276 --> 22:43.861
I, UM...

22:44.029 --> 22:45.529
I MADE ONE
FOR SUE, TOO.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.281
IF YOU'D GIVE IT
TO HER FOR ME...

22:47.449 --> 22:50.284
OH, WHY DON'T
YOU DO IT?

22:50.452 --> 22:52.161
NO.

22:53.997 --> 22:55.498
NO. YOU GIVE IT TO HER.

22:55.665 --> 22:59.126
SHE'S SUCH
A SWEET GIRL.

22:59.294 --> 23:01.003
SHE THINKS
THE WORLD OF YOU.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.172
I BETTER GIVE IT
TO HER AFTER CLASS.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.008
SHE'LL BE
TOO EXCITED
TO DO HER WORK.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.843
AND THANK YOU, JOHN.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.972
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

23:13.016 --> 23:14.892
Mary: ALL RIGHT,
OUR TUMMIES ARE FULL.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.394
LET'S SEE
IF OUR HEADS ARE.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.812
[CHILDREN LAUGH]

23:17.979 --> 23:20.356
THE LIVERY SCHOOL IS WORKING
ON ESSAYS RIGHT NOW,

23:20.524 --> 23:25.778
AND I DON'T SEE
ANY REASON WHY WE CAN'T
DO ANYTHING THEY DO.

23:25.946 --> 23:28.781
[CHILDREN GROAN]

23:28.949 --> 23:31.492
ALL RIGHT.
YOU MAY WRITE YOUR ESSAYS

23:31.660 --> 23:33.953
ON ANYTHING
OR ANYONE YOU WISH.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.497
THE YOUNGER STUDENTS
CAN WRITE AS LITTLE
OR AS MUCH AS THEY WISH,

23:36.665 --> 23:38.374
BUT THE OLDER STUDENTS...

23:38.542 --> 23:40.376
THE OLDER STUDENTS
SHOULD HAVE ESSAYS
OF AT LEAST 200 WORDS.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.044
Thomas:
MISS INGALLS?

23:42.212 --> 23:43.337
YES, THOMAS?

23:43.505 --> 23:44.922
AM I AN OLDER
STUDENT?

23:45.090 --> 23:47.007
YES. I'M AFRAID SO.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.926
I'M AWFUL SHORT.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.928
SO IS
GENERAL TOM THUMB,

23:51.096 --> 23:52.555
BUT HE'S 42 YEARS OLD.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.889
HA HA HA!

23:54.057 --> 23:55.891
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYONE TO WORK.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.610
[GIRLS LAUGHING]

24:06.778 --> 24:09.780
MAMA?

24:09.948 --> 24:11.991
SHE'S NOT HERE.
SHE'LL BE BACK SOON.
WANT A COOKIE?

24:12.159 --> 24:15.619
SURE. WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO WRITE ABOUT?

24:15.787 --> 24:17.746
I DON'T KNOW YET.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.331
I KIND OF MISS
BEING BACK AT OUR FARM.

24:19.499 --> 24:20.833
I THINK I'LL WRITE
ABOUT THAT.

24:21.001 --> 24:21.834
HERE.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.878
THANKS.

24:24.045 --> 24:28.340
MM! THIS IS WONDERFUL!
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

24:28.508 --> 24:30.551
MA BUYS THEM
AT YOUR HOTEL.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.219
NO WONDER
THEY'RE SO GOOD.

24:32.387 --> 24:33.929
I HELP MAKE THEM!

24:34.097 --> 24:35.431
HA HA HA!

24:35.599 --> 24:37.725
HELP ME THINK
OF SOMETHING
TO WRITE ABOUT.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.936
WELL, YOU'RE NEW
IN THE CITY.

24:41.104 --> 24:42.605
YOU COULD WRITE
ABOUT THAT--

24:42.772 --> 24:44.440
YOU KNOW,
HOW DIFFERENT IT IS.

24:44.608 --> 24:48.944
I SUPPOSE.
I DON'T KNOW.

24:49.112 --> 24:51.572
HOW LONG HAS
YOUR PA BEEN GONE?

24:53.575 --> 24:56.952
A LONG TIME.
MONTHS.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.163
WELL, YOU COULD
WRITE ABOUT THAT,

24:59.331 --> 25:00.789
HOW MUCH YOU
MISS HIM AND ALL.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.791
MY PA WENT AWAY
A COUPLE OF TIMES,

25:02.959 --> 25:05.252
AND I MISSED HIM
SOMETHING FIERCE.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.923
I THINK I'LL WRITE
ABOUT THE CITY.

25:09.090 --> 25:09.965
[CRACK]

25:10.133 --> 25:12.593
DADBURNIT. I ALWAYS
PUSH TOO HARD.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.137
THERE'S A SHARPENER
ON THE TABLE.

25:19.643 --> 25:22.269
OH, THIS IS PRETTY.

25:22.437 --> 25:23.812
WHAT?

25:23.980 --> 25:26.148
THIS NECKLACE.
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

25:26.316 --> 25:29.860
MY PA MADE IT FOR ME
A LONG TIME AGO.

25:30.028 --> 25:33.572
WELL, THIS ISN'T GOING TO
GET MY ESSAY WRITTEN.

25:47.337 --> 25:49.588
YOU'RE GOING
TO GET IT!

25:49.756 --> 25:51.173
HI, MARY! HI, MA!

25:51.341 --> 25:52.925
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN?

25:53.093 --> 25:54.677
I THOUGHT
IT WAS ALBERT'S TURN
TO WORK TODAY.

25:54.844 --> 25:57.221
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU JUST RUN OFF
WITHOUT ASKING ME.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.764
WELL, I'VE BEEN
WITH AMELIA.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.266
WE'VE BEEN DOING OUR
HOMEWORK TOGETHER.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.559
OH, THEN YOU APOLOGIZED.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.018
YES, MA'AM,
BUT IT WAS ALL
A BIG MISTAKE.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.520
MR. BEVINS
ISN'T HER PA.

26:04.688 --> 26:05.938
Mary: MR. BEVINS?

26:06.106 --> 26:08.023
YES. LAURA SAID
A FEW THINGS SHE
SHOULDN'T HAVE.

26:08.191 --> 26:10.776
BUT I LEARNED
MY LESSON, HONEST.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.778
Mary: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE SCHOOL
WOULD DO WITHOUT HIM.

26:12.946 --> 26:14.822
HE'S THE KINDEST MAN
TO EVERYBODY.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.074
LOOK WHAT
HE GAVE ME TODAY.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.867
IT'S ALL HAND-CARVED.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.536
Caroline: BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T IT?

26:20.704 --> 26:21.870
ASIDE FROM ALL
HIS OTHER WORK,

26:22.038 --> 26:24.582
HE MAKES LOOMS AND TOYS--
ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.500
HE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE IT
WHEN YOU THANK HIM.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.711
IT'S A RARE PERSON
TO FIND IN THIS CITY.

26:28.878 --> 26:31.463
LAURA, YOU WANT
TO HELP ME WITH
THIS CINNAMON BREAD?

26:31.631 --> 26:35.926
I CAN'T. I STILL HAVE
SOME HOMEWORK TO DO.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.767
MARY, DOES MR. BEVINS
HAVE A FAMILY?

26:43.935 --> 26:46.520
HE HAS SOME RELATIVES
IN THE EAST.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.314
HE EVEN HELPS THEM.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.482
WE CAN'T PAY HIM MUCH,
