Oh, it's-it's so special,

I'm gonna give it to

01:01.420 --> 01:02.920
a real big surprise.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.319
- Yeah. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:05.340 --> 01:06.880
Oh, crap.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.340
I got her a hat.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.280
Well, don't panic. Was it a nice hat?

01:11.300 --> 01:13.489
I got it at Denny's.

01:13.570 --> 01:16.159
Oh, no, Charlie. Why?

01:16.160 --> 01:17.820
Because I was there when she texted me

01:17.840 --> 01:19.450
that it was our six-month anniversary.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.780
Who celebrates their six-month
anniversary anyway?

01:21.800 --> 01:24.834
I mean, I know we're old, but do
you have to count every second?

01:24.961 --> 01:27.340
Well, you know what you
got to do now, don't you?

01:27.360 --> 01:29.660
Yeah. Fake my own death again.

01:31.360 --> 01:32.840
No, you got to write her a song.

01:32.850 --> 01:34.969
And it better be better than her song

01:35.013 --> 01:38.681
but not so much better that
it makes her song look bad.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.360
- I'll help you. Songwriting's easy.
- Oh,

01:41.390 --> 01:43.919
you think songwriting is easy?

01:43.920 --> 01:45.360
Hell yeah.

01:45.380 --> 01:48.320
I wrote an erotic vampire novel, woman.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.770
Songwriting's a piece of cake.

01:51.860 --> 01:54.660
Charlie, you want to stay
with Kathleen, right?

01:54.690 --> 01:55.780
- I do.
- Well, then

01:55.800 --> 01:56.880
I would highly advise you

01:56.900 --> 01:58.600
against this particular collaboration.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.680
This is not Hall & Oates.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.860
This is all Oates.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.820
So you saying we can't
write a romantic song?

02:06.880 --> 02:09.680
I'm saying you guys have seven divorces

02:09.699 --> 02:11.714
between the two of you.

02:11.750 --> 02:15.100
Yeah, that means we got
seven women to marry us.

02:17.860 --> 02:21.520
Okay, well, I, being a
woman, understand women.

02:21.540 --> 02:23.900
Not only that but I had a
professional songwriting career.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.540
- So I should help.
- Oh, my God.

02:25.580 --> 02:28.397
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, today

02:28.440 --> 02:31.140
is gonna be the very
best day of my life.

02:31.180 --> 02:34.960
Oh, is J.Crew finally selling boy sizes?

02:34.980 --> 02:36.220
J.Crew?

02:36.250 --> 02:38.500
Please, honey, what
am I, a youth pastor?

02:39.800 --> 02:42.400
Guess who is signing autographs

02:42.430 --> 02:44.038
at the convention center.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.060
The cutest teen idol

02:46.080 --> 02:48.480
of the early fall of 1969.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.480
Charles Manson?

02:51.520 --> 02:54.000
No! Not Charles Manson.

02:54.020 --> 02:56.340
Kip Samgood.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.140
Kip Samgood?

02:58.180 --> 03:00.200
He is a son of a bitch.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.760
He's the whole reason my
music career never took off.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.725
You know Kip Samgood?

03:04.760 --> 03:06.479
You shut your damn mouth.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.380
Tell me everything.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.460
I only wrote his biggest song.

03:10.490 --> 03:13.984
Oh, please, Margaret.

03:14.070 --> 03:17.300
You wrote "Bellbottom of My Heart"?

03:17.320 --> 03:18.640
I most certainly did.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.140
And I was performing it in clubs

03:20.170 --> 03:22.480
months before it was ever on his album.

03:22.510 --> 03:25.120
You know what, if you are
gonna see that bastard today,

03:25.140 --> 03:26.240
I'm gonna go there.

03:26.260 --> 03:28.079
I'm gonna make him admit
that he stole it.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.800
Uh-uh. No, no, no.

03:30.820 --> 03:32.480
You are not gonna mess this up for me.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.140
You are not invited.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.880
This has bothered me for years.

03:35.900 --> 03:38.560
I'm gonna go confront
this head-on. I am going.

03:38.580 --> 03:42.096
Margaret. You said you were
gonna help us write a song.

03:42.100 --> 03:44.720
Just give her the damn hat.

All right, Margaret, now,

04:10.877 --> 04:14.462
please let me tell Kip
what he means to me.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.060
I wrote an entire speech.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.630
Okay, but when you're done with him,

04:18.649 --> 04:20.399
I'm gonna rip him a new one.

04:20.420 --> 04:22.880
K-I-P is gonna be R.I.P.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.660
And you were a professional songwriter?

04:25.680 --> 04:27.920
How you doing, buddy? What's your name?

04:27.935 --> 04:31.720
Hi. Kip, my name is
Sidney, uh, Delacroix,

04:31.740 --> 04:35.240
and I have waited 50 years
to read you this letter.

04:35.260 --> 04:36.520
"Dear Kip,

04:36.550 --> 04:39.500
"As a lonely little gay boy
growing up in Tex... "

04:39.520 --> 04:41.520
- Here's your tambourine.
- Yeah, but I didn't get

04:41.530 --> 04:42.660
- to finish my speech.
- Next!

04:42.700 --> 04:44.520
Step aside, sir.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.300
- My turn.
- Yeah, well, please,

04:46.340 --> 04:49.100
Margaret, I didn't get
to finish my speech.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.415
Well, hello, hotness.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.700
What are you getting signed today?

04:53.800 --> 04:56.500
Boobs are a two-for-one special.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.967
That's my little joke.

05:03.429 --> 05:05.540
Honestly, Kip, are you gonna pretend

05:05.560 --> 05:07.160
that you don't know who I am?

05:07.266 --> 05:09.220
Listen, if you've got a kid somewhere,

05:09.240 --> 05:10.800
I got snipped in '79.

05:10.820 --> 05:12.895
Court ordered.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.340
It's me, Margaret Flynn.

05:15.380 --> 05:18.200
I wrote "Bellbottom of My Heart."

05:19.520 --> 05:21.560
Oh, my God.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.940
You wrote that?

05:22.960 --> 05:25.880
You know damn good and well I wrote it.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.950
You... Wait,

05:27.990 --> 05:30.700
you admit that you stole my song?

05:30.720 --> 05:32.050
No, I didn't steal it.

05:32.070 --> 05:34.080
My record company gave it to me.

05:34.110 --> 05:37.680
But I have spent my entire
life wondering who wrote it,

05:37.700 --> 05:40.790
because I know that that person...

05:40.920 --> 05:43.080
was a genius.

05:43.094 --> 05:44.718
A genius? Seriously?

05:44.760 --> 05:47.180
I mean, "genius" is a little strong,

05:47.200 --> 05:49.800
but... I'll allow it.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.500
I was at a party with Paul Simon.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.580
Heard of him?

05:55.120 --> 05:57.260
He told me it was his
favorite song of mine.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.680
Now, he may have been high as
a kite at the time, but...

05:59.700 --> 06:01.402
he said it.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.150
Say, what do you say

06:05.180 --> 06:06.760
you and I... we go to the greenroom.

06:06.790 --> 06:09.100
I would love to hear
more about your process.

06:09.130 --> 06:11.240
I've got oodles of questions

06:11.260 --> 06:12.600
- about it.
- Well...

06:12.610 --> 06:15.280
The-the greenroom? I'm
still really mad at you,

06:15.300 --> 06:17.819
but I-I guess-I guess I
am a little bit hungry.

06:17.820 --> 06:18.900
Well, the spread's amazing.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.640
We've got three kinds of cream cheese.

06:20.660 --> 06:23.132
And we've got wraps!

06:24.800 --> 06:27.960
I love wraps. Let's do it.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.440
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

06:29.470 --> 06:31.099
I've only got a plus-one.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.720
Now, I must know more about your work.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.080
Have you written any other songs?

06:35.100 --> 06:36.660
Well, I've written a few.
I mean, you know, I...

06:36.680 --> 06:38.780
Margaret, what the hell? Kip!

06:38.800 --> 06:42.520
Please, I can be your
plus-one and a half.

06:42.580 --> 06:45.480
Sid, I won't be long. I
promise. I won't forget you.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.866
Ugh, Margaret, don't do this to me!

06:48.951 --> 06:50.826
At least read him my letter!

06:50.950 --> 06:53.680
You bitch!

06:57.620 --> 06:59.799
All right, now, look, we
don't need Margaret's help

06:59.800 --> 07:01.720
- to write no song about no woman.
- No.

07:01.740 --> 07:03.270
'Cause one thing I know is

07:03.299 --> 07:05.841
women don't know what they want.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.400
You take my ex-wife... I
thought she wanted me,

07:08.420 --> 07:10.930
but apparently she wanted that
big son of a bitch upstairs.

07:10.973 --> 07:14.800
Look, Hank, c-can we not talk
about Lorraine right now?

07:14.820 --> 07:17.059
We just do not have the time.

07:17.060 --> 07:19.060
You're right. I'm sorry.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.599
There was a point to it, but all right.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.979
Tell me what kind of
song Kathleen wants.

07:24.980 --> 07:27.980
I don't know. Something nice and sweet

07:28.000 --> 07:29.820
about how much I love her.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.991
No, no, no. No, no.

07:31.030 --> 07:32.740
You got to give her something dark.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.280
Not a sweet song. A bad-boy song.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.540
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, play me a chord.

07:36.570 --> 07:38.374
Well...

07:38.500 --> 07:39.860
Moodier.

07:39.890 --> 07:41.502
Um...

07:44.290 --> 07:46.380
All right, that's it, right there.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.960
Okay.

07:48.980 --> 07:50.880
So, I'm just gonna riff, okay?

07:50.900 --> 07:53.180
'Cause, you know, most
great songs are just

07:53.200 --> 07:55.000

10:17.770 --> 10:19.980
Say, speaking of champagne,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.160
can I, uh, top off your glass?

10:22.180 --> 10:25.720
It's from New York State.

10:25.790 --> 10:28.200
I don't mind if I do.

10:28.220 --> 10:29.740
Mm.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.320
Mmm.

10:31.860 --> 10:34.280
You really can taste the Albany.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.919
Well, come. Sit.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.740
Tell me about your career.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.890
Oh, well, to be perfectly honest, Kip,

10:39.920 --> 10:42.260
my career didn't ever really take off.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.270
I did write a jingle one time

10:44.280 --> 10:47.260
for an adult diaper commercial
that I'm pretty ashamed of,

10:47.280 --> 10:49.400
but... other than that,

10:49.420 --> 10:51.220
I only had one real album,

10:51.240 --> 10:53.480
and it was kind of a dud.
It was called Carpet.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.530
You wrote Carpet?

10:56.550 --> 10:58.031
I love Carpet.

10:58.110 --> 10:59.720
I used to beg my label,

10:59.743 --> 11:03.370
"Please, let me cover
a song from Carpet."

11:03.497 --> 11:04.830
- Really?
- Mm.

11:04.910 --> 11:06.180
Which one was your favorite?

11:06.200 --> 11:08.480
Which song was your favorite?

11:08.502 --> 11:12.254
I think "Vacuum" was
probably the strongest.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.820
- Oh, it was definitely the strongest.
- Hmm.

11:14.850 --> 11:16.879
Oh, gosh, I wish I could hear it now.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.880
I could sing it for you now.

11:18.940 --> 11:21.720
Oh... I would die.

11:21.780 --> 11:24.060
But tragically, we don't have a guitar.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.540
This guy's got a guitar right here.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.200
Oh...

11:28.220 --> 11:29.960
how wonderful.

11:33.220 --> 11:34.990
Margaret, just calling you back.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.060
Wasn't sure you got the
first 16 messages.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.660
I-I really can't wait to meet Kip.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.326
So call me back.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.203
Uh, it's Sid, by the way.

11:44.220 --> 11:46.740
Delacroix, from Shady Meadows.

11:46.770 --> 11:50.180
I really hate to bother you.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.240
But I'm supposed to be in the greenroom

11:52.270 --> 11:54.520
with Kip and my friend.

11:54.540 --> 11:55.760
Sorry, hoss.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.540
Only VIPs past this point.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.440
Yeah.

11:59.470 --> 12:02.070
Well, I don't normally do this,

12:02.097 --> 12:05.140
but I am... famous.

12:05.260 --> 12:08.000
Super famous.

12:08.103 --> 12:11.480
So I'll just be going in the G.R. now.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.316
That's what we call the
greenroom in the biz.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.720
"The biz" being "the business",
and by "the business"...

12:17.740 --> 12:20.180
... we mean show business.

12:20.190 --> 12:22.420
Hold on.

12:22.490 --> 12:24.080
You're famous? For what?

12:24.110 --> 12:25.327
Um...

12:25.450 --> 12:27.100
the Star Wars.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.830
You were in Star Wars?

12:28.870 --> 12:31.360
Uh, yeah.

12:32.670 --> 12:36.004
You know that little robot? R2-D2?

12:36.131 --> 12:37.631
More like R2-Me-2.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.180
It's me.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.070
Prove it. Do the voice.

12:42.090 --> 12:44.700
- Well, I don't think that that's really...
- Do it.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.760
Beep. Beep, beep, beep, squeebo.

12:47.770 --> 12:48.780
Furby.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.220
Beep. Ooh. Hee, hee, hee.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.120
No.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.680
Okay, fine.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.440
I really hate admitting this,
but I am the little boy

13:01.470 --> 13:04.100
from Home Alone. Does this ring a bell?

13:04.159 --> 13:06.535
I'm Ma-curly Curl-kin

13:06.660 --> 13:08.820
and I'm home alone, y'all.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.100
Aah!

13:11.166 --> 13:14.209
Look, buddy. I'm gonna say
this as nice as I can.

13:14.220 --> 13:16.920
Kip Samgood is banging
your wife right now.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.463
My wife?

13:18.540 --> 13:19.720
- Yeah.
- Ugh. No, no, no.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.140
It's my friend.

13:21.176 --> 13:24.052
And any moment she's gonna
realize she left me out here

13:24.130 --> 13:25.880

13:39.140 --> 13:40.180

Punam, Charlie got to write
a song for Kathleen,

13:43.020 --> 13:45.640
but he can't figure out what
kind of song she likes.

13:45.701 --> 13:48.035
Now, we reached a compromise,
but we just need

13:48.070 --> 13:50.119
a woman's touch to bring it on home.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.860
- All right, Charlie, make it funky.
- Okay.

13:51.957 --> 13:55.709
♪ Kathleen ♪

14:28.285 --> 14:31.270
It is moody, it's sexy...

14:31.280 --> 14:33.220
- Yeah.
- ... and it's religiously conservative,

14:33.240 --> 14:36.270
which I indicated in the song
when I said the booty was,

14:36.290 --> 14:38.740
um, Protestant.

14:38.750 --> 14:41.320
Yeah.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.780
That was a really bad song.

14:45.094 --> 14:47.170
But if you're trying to get your
girlfriend to break up with you,

14:47.200 --> 14:48.760
it'll definitely work.

14:50.099 --> 14:53.470
So you're really not
gonna let me in there?

14:53.500 --> 14:55.380
It's literally my only job.

14:56.390 --> 14:58.740
This was supposed to be
the best day of my life.

14:58.770 --> 15:00.840
It's turning out to be the worst.

15:00.980 --> 15:02.700
It's only a greenroom, man.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.320
I could bring you out a Bagel Bite.

15:05.350 --> 15:06.988
No, you don't understand.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.380

15:08.400 --> 15:11.240

Maybe you can relay to Kip

15:13.950 --> 15:15.320
what I wrote.

15:15.330 --> 15:17.120
I'm gonna read you this letter.

two to four minutes?

16:13.600 --> 16:16.180

back here to hook up with me?

16:16.226 --> 16:17.559
No.

16:17.570 --> 16:20.320

- He, uh, overpowered me?

Actually, I can't. Charlie?

16:47.920 --> 16:51.000
Um... we need help writing a song.

16:51.020 --> 16:53.500
Oh, you came to me.

I need a love song

17:07.440 --> 17:08.859
and I need it fast.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.694
Oh, my God.

17:10.781 --> 17:12.614
Okay, first things first.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.640
Clancy, you're clearly fired.

17:15.661 --> 17:18.670
And you... you're just another
one of my deranged loser fans.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.319
And I'm tired of looking at you.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.455
Go away.

17:23.290 --> 17:25.599
And you two... I don't know who you are,

17:25.628 --> 17:27.280
but I can't write you a song

17:27.300 --> 17:29.620
because I don't write music.

17:29.633 --> 17:32.676
The whole thing was fake, okay?

17:32.700 --> 17:35.220
You mean your songs were not real?

17:35.250 --> 17:36.580
None of it was real.

17:36.590 --> 17:37.980
Even my name is fake.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.100
You know what my real
name is? Greg Napkin.

17:40.820 --> 17:44.180
Well, I can see why they changed that.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.930
You know what?

17:45.940 --> 17:49.559
I can't even believe I
fell for your crap.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.040
I should sue you over "Bell
Bottom of My Heart."

17:53.320 --> 17:56.340
Well, I don't have any money.
I bet big on Betamax.

17:57.220 --> 17:58.980
Sid, come on.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.040
I'm sorry I ditched you. Charlie,

18:01.080 --> 18:03.400
I will write you a love song. Let's go.

18:03.420 --> 18:06.140
Hank, go easy on the Bagel Bites.

18:06.170 --> 18:08.295

tell me what to do.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.007
Hey.

18:12.130 --> 18:14.080
And as for you, Napkin,

18:14.100 --> 18:16.020
I may have written "Vacuum",

18:16.040 --> 18:18.220
but you suck.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.770
Oh, Sid.

18:29.860 --> 18:32.193
I'm so sorry I abandoned you.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.863
I, uh, I got a little carried away.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.820
Oh, honey, I forgive you.

18:37.868 --> 18:40.080
I still can't believe

18:40.100 --> 18:42.410
that Kip was a fake.

18:42.490 --> 18:45.760
But on the bright side, I
guess, I made a new friend.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.461
Clancy and I are going to a
Lil Wayne concert tomorrow.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.640
