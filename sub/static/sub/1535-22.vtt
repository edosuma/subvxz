WEBVTT

00:02.017 --> 00:03.919
It's, like,
the best one they make,

00:03.921 --> 00:05.954
I just can't get it to work.
I'll figure it out.

00:05.955 --> 00:09.391
It streams HD video straight
to your phone while it's flying.

00:09.393 --> 00:10.792
Nice.

00:10.794 --> 00:13.095
Where were you
when I was single?

00:15.698 --> 00:18.433
Okay, we should leave in
about an hour. You all packed?

00:18.435 --> 00:20.769
Uh, yeah, I just need to throw
in a few last minute things--

00:20.771 --> 00:23.071
you know, makeup,
underwear, clothes.

00:23.740 --> 00:25.641
If your bathroom floor

00:25.643 --> 00:27.643
counts as a carry-on,
you're packed.

00:28.578 --> 00:30.145
Leonard,
have you ever given

00:30.147 --> 00:31.680
a high school
commencement speech before?

00:31.682 --> 00:33.382
Nope. It's pretty exciting.

00:33.384 --> 00:35.784
Aren't you afraid
of being blinded?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.519
How would I be blinded?

00:37.521 --> 00:39.187
At the end of the ceremony,

00:39.189 --> 00:41.923
all the students throw
those pointy hats in the air.

00:43.059 --> 00:44.459
It's all pomp and circumstance

00:44.461 --> 00:47.029
until someone loses an eye.

00:47.031 --> 00:48.664
I'll take my chances.

00:48.666 --> 00:49.865
Fine.

00:49.867 --> 00:51.133
I wonder if they make

00:51.135 --> 00:53.368
"I told you so"
cards in braille.

00:55.104 --> 00:56.938
Look, the problem
with commencement speeches

00:56.940 --> 00:58.907
is that they're boring.

00:58.909 --> 01:01.143
Ooh, do you own
a T-shirt cannon?

01:01.978 --> 01:04.012
Why would he own
a T-shirt cannon?

01:04.013 --> 01:06.114
I don't know. Why do I own one?

01:07.150 --> 01:08.483
I think it's really nice

01:08.485 --> 01:10.018
that you're sharing
this experience with Penny.

01:10.020 --> 01:11.520
Mm, I thought
it'd be fun

01:11.522 --> 01:13.388
to show her my old
stomping grounds.

01:13.390 --> 01:16.858
I even know the exact spot
where they used to stomp me.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.094
Well, now you
get to go back

01:19.096 --> 01:20.462
as a successful
scientist.

01:20.464 --> 01:22.464
With a beautiful girl
on your arm.

01:22.466 --> 01:25.334
And a pointy hat sticking
out of your eyeball.

01:54.883 --> 01:56.701
How'd you get
ready so fast?

01:56.702 --> 01:58.034
Oh, I pack light.

01:58.036 --> 01:59.703
Once, I got through
an entire spring break

01:59.705 --> 02:01.905
with nothing
but a long T-shirt and a belt.

02:03.474 --> 02:04.841
Why did you need a belt?

02:04.843 --> 02:07.778
It's called an
evening look.

02:07.780 --> 02:09.979
I've never been to
New Jersey before.

02:09.982 --> 02:11.882
It gets a bad rap from shows

02:11.884 --> 02:14.050
like <i>Jersey Shore</i>
and <i>Real Housewives.</i>

02:14.052 --> 02:15.685
So it's not
really like that?

02:15.687 --> 02:17.854
No, it's like that.

02:18.856 --> 02:20.624
Well, I'm excited
to show you around.

02:20.626 --> 02:22.726
You think we'll have time
to visit your mom over there?

02:22.728 --> 02:25.796
Yes. We'll also have time to put
my junk in a garlic press,

02:25.798 --> 02:28.165
but I'm not
doing that either.

02:28.167 --> 02:30.934
(phone chimes)

02:30.936 --> 02:32.436
Uh-oh.

02:32.438 --> 02:34.171
I just got an alert.

02:34.173 --> 02:35.372
Our flight's
been canceled.

02:35.374 --> 02:36.406
What?

02:36.408 --> 02:37.841
Yeah, looks like
there's a big storm

02:37.843 --> 02:39.376
all up the East Coast.

02:39.378 --> 02:41.278
Well, can we get
on another airline?

02:41.280 --> 02:42.646
I don't think so.

02:42.648 --> 02:43.947
So, that's it?

02:43.949 --> 02:44.949
We're not going?

02:44.950 --> 02:47.217
I guess not.
(scoffs)

02:47.219 --> 02:48.251
Well, that sucks.

02:48.253 --> 02:49.352
Yeah.

02:49.354 --> 02:50.620
I worked hard on
that speech, too.

02:50.622 --> 02:52.823
Oh. You could tell it to me.

02:52.825 --> 02:54.458
Oh, thank you,
but I'm okay.

02:54.460 --> 02:55.859
Are you sure?

02:55.861 --> 02:57.494
I could pretend I'm a
high school cheerleader

02:57.496 --> 02:59.830
who can't control herself
around esteemed alumni.

03:01.866 --> 03:03.934
Greetings, distinguished
cheerleaders.

03:03.936 --> 03:06.203
Ooh!

03:07.338 --> 03:09.840
Okay, the WiFi extender
is on, the camera's on,

03:09.842 --> 03:11.174
they're both on
the same network;

03:11.176 --> 03:12.509
we should be
getting an image.

03:12.511 --> 03:14.911
All I see is a black screen.

03:14.913 --> 03:16.546
And my own reflection.

03:18.015 --> 03:19.082
I look sad.

03:21.252 --> 03:22.986
Maybe we should
recalibrate it.

03:22.988 --> 03:24.688
All right.
Step one:

03:24.690 --> 03:26.723
rapidly flip
the calibration switch

03:26.725 --> 03:28.758
from the fully up
to the fully down positions

03:28.760 --> 03:30.427
for at least ten times.

03:30.429 --> 03:33.330
It actually says "at least"?

03:33.332 --> 03:34.965
Yeah.

03:34.967 --> 03:36.533
Why would they say "at least"?

03:36.535 --> 03:37.968
Is it ten toggles?

03:37.970 --> 03:39.903
Is it 100 toggles? You know?

03:39.905 --> 03:41.771
Is it 1,000 toggles?

03:41.773 --> 03:43.573
10,000 toggles?
100,000 toggles?

03:43.575 --> 03:46.076
Sheldon!

03:46.078 --> 03:48.979
You see where
I'm going with this.

03:48.981 --> 03:51.081
Just flip the switch

03:51.083 --> 03:54.217
until the lights on the drone
change to solid yellow.

03:54.219 --> 03:56.419
All right,
that seems simple enough.

03:56.421 --> 03:59.489
Initiating calibration sequence.

03:59.491 --> 04:01.558
One, two, three, four,

04:01.560 --> 04:05.328
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

04:07.865 --> 04:11.301
Well, I suppose ten
is technically "at least ten."

04:13.204 --> 04:16.072
But they're still getting
at least one angry letter.

04:18.209 --> 04:20.744
Now I rotate
it horizontally

04:20.745 --> 04:24.781
on its center axis until
the lights turn green.

04:24.783 --> 04:26.950
Initiating rotation sequence.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.922
Don't look at me, initiate.

04:34.892 --> 04:36.459
Oh...
What does red and yellow mean?

04:36.461 --> 04:38.094
It means the
calibration failed.

04:38.096 --> 04:39.529
We have to start over.

04:39.531 --> 04:40.463
Oh. Very well.

04:40.465 --> 04:43.567
Reinitiating
calibration sequence.

04:43.569 --> 04:45.302
One, two, three, four,

04:45.304 --> 04:48.738
five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

04:51.108 --> 04:53.944
...eleven.

04:55.179 --> 04:58.648
It's a good thing
I didn't send that letter.

05:01.319 --> 05:03.520
(Skype ringtone plays)

05:04.789 --> 05:07.190
Mm. Hello, Daddy. What's up?

05:07.192 --> 05:09.626
Not much, just wanted to see
how my son's doing.

05:09.628 --> 05:11.561
Very well, thank you.

05:11.563 --> 05:13.663
Are you still dating
that dermatologist?

05:13.665 --> 05:16.366
If you could feel
how soft my skin is,

05:16.368 --> 05:19.035
you wouldn't have to ask.

05:19.037 --> 05:22.172
Oh, and there's something else
I wanted to ask you.

05:22.174 --> 05:26.409
Why did you spend a month's rent
on a toy helicopter?!

05:26.411 --> 05:30.180
Oh, you're where that bill goes.

05:30.182 --> 05:33.316
I'm tired of indulging
your foolish lifestyle.

05:33.318 --> 05:34.884
It's time you learned
responsibility.

05:34.886 --> 05:36.453
And the only way
to teach you that

05:36.455 --> 05:37.921
is to cut off your allowance.

05:37.923 --> 05:39.723
No, Daddy, no!

05:39.725 --> 05:41.992
There are lots of other ways
to teach me responsibility.

05:41.994 --> 05:43.660
I know, you can give me an egg

05:43.662 --> 05:46.363
and make me take care of it
for a week!

05:46.365 --> 05:48.665
No, my mind is made up.

05:48.667 --> 05:49.966
Starting now,
you're on your own.

05:49.968 --> 05:53.837
But, Daddy,
I-I miss my family so much,

05:53.839 --> 05:56.106
and with you and Mummy
getting a divorce,

05:56.108 --> 05:57.907
I feel sad and empty.

05:57.909 --> 05:59.476
Buying a little toy

05:59.478 --> 06:02.212
every now and then
helps me fill that void.

06:02.214 --> 06:04.447
So while I can't
hug you every day,

06:04.449 --> 06:06.116
flying that helicopter...

06:06.118 --> 06:07.283
I'm cutting you off.

06:07.285 --> 06:11.454
Just to be clear,
financially or mid-sentence?

06:14.125 --> 06:15.759
No red and yellow,

06:15.761 --> 06:17.227
no red and yellow.

06:17.928 --> 06:18.995
Yay!
It's green!

06:18.997 --> 06:20.463
We did it!

06:20.465 --> 06:21.898
Oh!

06:21.900 --> 06:26.236
God, if it's this much fun to
rotate, imagine when we fly it.

06:26.238 --> 06:29.039
Okay, now all I have to do
is rotate it vertically

06:29.041 --> 06:32.275
until the lights turn off.

06:32.277 --> 06:34.110
Oh, no!
Oh!

06:34.112 --> 06:37.213
All right,
playtime's over.

06:37.215 --> 06:38.948
Let's open
this baby up.

06:38.950 --> 06:41.217
Won't that void the warranty?

06:41.219 --> 06:45.355
Sheldon, I have a master's
degree in engineering.

06:45.357 --> 06:48.992
I wipe my bottom
with warranties.

06:50.127 --> 06:51.828
Except for AppleCare.

06:51.830 --> 06:54.798
That pays for itself
in the long run.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.001
Hi.

06:58.003 --> 06:59.235
Hey, where'd you go?

06:59.237 --> 07:02.305
I got you a little something
to cheer you up.

07:02.307 --> 07:03.273
Really?

07:03.275 --> 07:04.908
Sex last night,
pancakes this morning--

07:04.910 --> 07:07.677
Am I dying?
(chuckles)

07:07.679 --> 07:10.346
Just open it.

07:10.348 --> 07:11.514
A cap and gown?

07:11.516 --> 07:13.116
Why do I need a cap and gown?

07:13.118 --> 07:16.152
Because you are giving
your commencement speech.

07:16.154 --> 07:17.153
What are you talking about?

07:17.155 --> 07:18.521
I called your old high school

07:18.523 --> 07:21.958
and convinced them to let you
give your speech over Skype.

07:21.960 --> 07:22.992
Really?

07:22.994 --> 07:23.994
That's amazing!

07:23.995 --> 07:26.096
And you gave me the robes
to give it in.

07:26.098 --> 07:27.297
Thank you.

07:27.299 --> 07:28.231
Yeah, now about those--

07:28.233 --> 07:29.766
uh, they came from
a costume shop,

07:29.768 --> 07:32.268
and all they had left
was sexy graduate,

07:32.270 --> 07:33.336
so they...

07:33.338 --> 07:36.139
might be a little short.

07:36.141 --> 07:39.008
Short and sexy,
that's my wheelhouse.

07:39.010 --> 07:40.810
Yeah!

07:42.000 --> 07:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:49.420 --> 07:52.789
Boy, oh, boy,
that's a lot of pieces.

07:52.791 --> 07:54.691
You know
what they all do, right?

07:54.693 --> 07:56.860
Yes, of course.

07:56.862 --> 07:58.128
What about this one?

07:58.130 --> 08:00.930
Well, I...
how familiar are you

08:00.932 --> 08:03.366
with miniaturized
integrated logic circuits?

08:03.368 --> 08:04.501
Not very.

08:04.503 --> 08:05.668
That right there
is a miniaturized

08:05.670 --> 08:06.870
integrated logic circuit.

08:10.241 --> 08:12.075
So, can you
get it working?

08:12.077 --> 08:14.744
I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

08:14.746 --> 08:17.147
I've built components
for the space station.

08:17.149 --> 08:20.850
I thought the zero-gravity
toilet didn't work.

08:20.852 --> 08:22.552
It worked fine,

08:22.554 --> 08:25.355
it just wasn't designed
for Russian cosmonauts

08:25.357 --> 08:28.024
and their potato-based diet.

08:28.026 --> 08:29.692
Hey, guys.

08:29.694 --> 08:31.127
Hey.
Hello.

08:31.129 --> 08:33.096
I have to return the helicopter.
My father...

08:33.097 --> 08:36.332
What did you do?!

08:37.635 --> 08:38.701
Well, don't worry.

08:38.703 --> 08:40.068
He went to MIT.

08:40.071 --> 08:41.871
He can solve any problem,

08:41.873 --> 08:45.308
as long as it doesn't originate
in a Russian man's colon.

08:55.017 --> 08:56.617
I don't freaking
believe this!

08:56.619 --> 08:57.985
Relax, it'll be fine.

08:57.987 --> 08:59.620
No, you have to put
this back together

08:59.622 --> 09:01.455
right now,
so I can return it!

09:01.457 --> 09:03.124
You can't return it.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.127
Howard wiped his bottom
with the warranty.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.962
What?!

09:07.964 --> 09:09.697
I think metaphorically.

09:09.699 --> 09:12.133
But he was in the bathroom
for a while.

09:14.403 --> 09:15.770
Howard, my father cut me off.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.438
I have to get my money back
for this!

09:17.440 --> 09:18.739
Calm down.

09:18.741 --> 09:19.974
Okay.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.709
Okay, you're right.

09:21.711 --> 09:23.611
It's time for me to step up

09:23.613 --> 09:25.580
and take responsibility
for my life.

09:26.515 --> 09:27.982
Be a man.

09:30.285 --> 09:33.321
Hello, Mummy.

09:33.323 --> 09:34.689
Hello, Rajesh.

09:34.691 --> 09:36.624
What a nice surprise.

09:36.626 --> 09:37.925
Well, I've been
thinking about you.

09:37.927 --> 09:39.060
How are you doing?

09:39.062 --> 09:40.661
Are you happy, Mummy?

09:41.296 --> 09:43.297
Such a sweet boy for asking.

09:43.299 --> 09:47.368
Can't believe you come from
the poison seed of your father.

09:47.370 --> 09:49.837
Well, I like to think
I take mostly after you.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.272
Anyway,
speaking of Daddy,

09:51.274 --> 09:53.608
I had a very strange
conversation with him.

09:53.610 --> 09:55.943
He said he couldn't afford
to send me money anymore

09:55.945 --> 09:58.179
because of
his active social life.

09:58.181 --> 10:02.817
What does that mean,
"active social life"?

10:02.819 --> 10:04.185
Well, let's not talk about him

10:04.187 --> 10:06.487
or whatever shenanigans
he may or may not be up to.

10:06.489 --> 10:07.588
Let's talk about you.

10:07.590 --> 10:10.925
Rajesh, is your father
seeing someone?

10:10.927 --> 10:12.426
All I know, Mummy, is that

10:12.428 --> 10:15.596
he's a single wealthy doctor,
and now, for some reason,

10:15.598 --> 10:18.866
there's no money
for your little boy.

10:20.469 --> 10:23.204
Well, however much money
your father was giving you,

10:23.206 --> 10:24.338
I'll give you more.

10:24.340 --> 10:26.273
Thank you, Mummy, I love you!

10:26.275 --> 10:28.442
(quietly):
Helicopters for everybody!

10:30.912 --> 10:33.214
What's taking so long?

10:33.216 --> 10:34.682
LEONARD: I don't think
this is gonna work.

10:34.684 --> 10:36.050
Just let me see.

10:41.490 --> 10:44.191
Sweetie, you know
you're supposed to wear clothes

10:44.193 --> 10:45.860
underneath a graduation gown.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.895
A: surprised you know that.

10:49.031 --> 10:52.199
B: I wanted to look like
a sexy graduate for you.

10:52.201 --> 10:53.167
Oh.

10:53.169 --> 10:54.301
Well, you do.

10:54.303 --> 10:55.736
Oh. Thank you.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.505
Yeah.

10:57.507 --> 11:00.241
You're gonna be on Skype;
they're not gonna see your legs.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.143
Well, I'm gonna go put on
some pants just in case.

11:02.145 --> 11:04.879
But I have to say,
this is very freeing.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.681
(chuckles)

11:06.683 --> 11:10.084
Add a belt and I'll take you
someplace nice.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.086
Oh.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.287
Done and done.

11:19.528 --> 11:21.996
Okay, I think
I've narrowed it down

11:21.998 --> 11:25.032
to a faulty pin on
the onboard communication chip.

11:25.034 --> 11:27.668
Very impressive.

11:27.670 --> 11:29.770
You know, when you're
done with that,

11:29.772 --> 11:32.606
can you look at this?

11:33.975 --> 11:36.210
It doesn't make smoke anymore.

11:36.212 --> 11:38.279
One toy at a time.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.814
Mm. Sorry.

11:39.816 --> 11:41.182
Ah, maybe it's for the best.

11:41.184 --> 11:43.217
I hear locomotive smoke

11:43.219 --> 11:47.321
is the second leading cause of
death among train aficionados.

11:47.323 --> 11:48.589
What's the first one?

11:48.591 --> 11:50.825
Suicide.

11:50.827 --> 11:52.259
Wrong.

11:52.261 --> 11:53.594
Obesity.

11:55.564 --> 11:57.832
I have the tool you wanted.

11:57.834 --> 11:59.200
Thank you.

11:59.202 --> 12:01.102
You guys don't have
to go to the trouble.

12:01.104 --> 12:02.303
I'm back in the money now;

12:02.305 --> 12:03.604
I can just buy
another helicopter.

12:03.606 --> 12:04.872
It's not about the money.

12:04.874 --> 12:06.240
It's about solving a problem.

12:06.242 --> 12:07.808
It's why I became an engineer.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.144
It's what I like to do,
it's what I'm trained to do.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.113
It's who I am.

12:12.115 --> 12:15.082
Oh, look at you--
the little engineer that could.

12:16.752 --> 12:18.619
Why don't you just
call tech support?

12:18.621 --> 12:21.388
Hey! Whoa!
Not cool!

12:21.390 --> 12:22.556
What?

12:22.558 --> 12:24.125
There's two kinds of
people in this world:

12:24.127 --> 12:25.559
those who call
tech support

12:25.561 --> 12:29.063
and those who make fun of the
people who call tech support.

12:29.065 --> 12:30.698
I call tech support
all the time.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.066
Ha-ha!
You call tech support!

12:32.068 --> 12:33.734
What a baby!

12:34.903 --> 12:37.738
And now, for our
commencement address,

12:37.740 --> 12:40.207
one of our
most distinguished alumni,

12:40.209 --> 12:45.312
noted Caltech physicist
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

12:48.984 --> 12:51.285
Members of the faculty,
students,

12:51.287 --> 12:54.121
I'm excited to speak
to you today.

12:54.123 --> 12:55.389
I can't help but remember

12:55.391 --> 12:57.525
the last time
I was in this auditorium.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.059
Two guys from the lacrosse team

12:59.061 --> 13:02.329
played keep-away
with my asthma inhaler.

13:02.331 --> 13:05.966
But enough about
my ten-year reunion.

13:05.968 --> 13:08.469
I'd also like
to take a moment

13:08.471 --> 13:10.437
to thank
my beautiful fiancée

13:10.439 --> 13:12.039
for to helping make
this speech possible,

13:12.041 --> 13:14.008
even though weather
nearly prevented it.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.477
Oh. Hello.

13:16.479 --> 13:18.345
I-I didn't know
he was gonna point it at me,

13:18.347 --> 13:21.415
so... don't do drugs
and stay in school.

13:21.417 --> 13:22.216
They're graduating.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.617
Okay, bye!

13:26.087 --> 13:28.355
All right, the power
supply is reconnected.

13:28.357 --> 13:29.757
I think we're
back in business.

13:29.759 --> 13:32.493
Let's just run a few tests
before we take it outside.

13:32.495 --> 13:34.195
Sheldon, we got WiFi?
Check.

13:34.197 --> 13:35.362
GPS?
Check.

13:35.364 --> 13:37.064
Battery charged?
Check.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.501
Four hours of our lives gone?
Check.

13:40.503 --> 13:41.869
All right.

13:41.871 --> 13:43.037
All systems go.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.039
In five...

13:44.040 --> 13:46.841
...four, three, two, one.

13:46.843 --> 13:48.542
(electrical crackle)

13:52.547 --> 13:54.582
That's what my
train used to do.

13:57.986 --> 14:00.621
Ready to call
tech support?

14:00.623 --> 14:03.190
Give me the number.

14:03.192 --> 14:04.491
Probably wind up

14:04.493 --> 14:07.194
talking to some foreign guy

14:07.196 --> 14:11.332
who's reading from
the same manual I have.

14:12.767 --> 14:15.102
(phone ringing)

14:18.273 --> 14:20.274
It's my father, you jerks.

14:24.479 --> 14:25.679
Hello, Daddy.

14:25.681 --> 14:26.914
What did you say to your mother?

14:26.916 --> 14:27.916
Nothing.

14:27.917 --> 14:29.850
I was just calling to check in,

14:29.852 --> 14:31.185
make sure she's doing okay.

14:31.187 --> 14:32.486
Well, after talking to you,

14:32.488 --> 14:35.856
she seems to think
I'm some sort of playboy.

14:35.858 --> 14:37.191
Really?

14:37.193 --> 14:40.094
I don't know where
she'd get an idea like that.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.696
You know Mummy
and her crazy imagination.

14:42.698 --> 14:45.966
I'm so lucky I take after you.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.603
You think you take after me?

14:49.605 --> 14:50.971
Well, I try to.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.640
I certainly wouldn't
be a scientist

14:52.642 --> 14:56.477
if you hadn't been
my role model.

14:56.479 --> 15:00.347
Who wants to go to Vegas
in a real helicopter?!

15:03.852 --> 15:05.886
It was L. Frank Baum who said,

15:05.888 --> 15:11.025
"No thief, however skillful,
can rob one of knowledge,

15:11.027 --> 15:16.230
and that is why knowledge is
the best and safest treasure."

15:16.232 --> 15:19.433
Wow, I'm boring myself.

15:19.435 --> 15:21.268
(sighs)

15:21.270 --> 15:23.837
Sorry, I can't see
any of your faces right now,

15:23.839 --> 15:25.739
but I bet they look like this.

15:30.211 --> 15:34.248
Uh, you know,
I-I wrote an entire speech

15:34.250 --> 15:36.617
to say how high school
prepares you

15:36.619 --> 15:39.687
and what a wonderful
place it is,

15:39.689 --> 15:41.989
but I hated it.

15:41.991 --> 15:44.591
Maybe high school's great
if you look like this...

15:46.594 --> 15:51.498
...but I didn't even feel like
I existed at that school.

15:51.500 --> 15:54.101
And now that I think about it,

15:54.103 --> 15:56.670
I bet a lot of you
feel the same way.

15:56.672 --> 16:00.207
So, for the remainder
of my speech,

16:00.209 --> 16:03.510
this is for the invisible kids.

16:03.512 --> 16:06.814
Uh, maybe you never fit in.

16:06.816 --> 16:09.283
Or maybe you're
the smallest kid in the school,

16:09.285 --> 16:11.485
or the heaviest or the weirdest.

16:11.487 --> 16:12.686
Maybe you're graduating

16:12.688 --> 16:14.955
and you still haven't had
your first kiss.

16:14.957 --> 16:16.991
By the way, 19;

16:16.993 --> 16:20.427
and Geraldine Coco,
wherever you are, thank you.

16:22.097 --> 16:24.198
Maybe you don't have
any friends.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.034
And guess what? That's okay.

16:27.036 --> 16:29.303
While all the popular kids
are off doing--

16:29.305 --> 16:31.238
whatever, I don't know
what they were doing

16:31.240 --> 16:32.539
'cause I was never there...

16:32.541 --> 16:35.075
I'll-I'll tell you later.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.911
My point is,

16:37.913 --> 16:40.014
while you're spending
all this time on your own,

16:40.016 --> 16:44.018
building computers
or practicing your cello,

16:44.020 --> 16:47.888
what you're really doing
is becoming interesting.

16:47.890 --> 16:50.991
And when people finally
do notice you,

16:50.993 --> 16:54.061
they're gonna find someone
a lot cooler than they thought.

16:54.063 --> 16:56.630
And for those of you
who were popular in high school,

16:56.632 --> 16:59.967
it's over, sorry.

16:59.969 --> 17:02.836
Thank you and congratulations.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.643
TECH SUPPORT (recording):
Your call is important to us.

17:09.645 --> 17:11.979
All our technicians are busy
helping other customers.

17:11.981 --> 17:13.247
Please stay on the line

17:13.249 --> 17:15.315
and someone will be
with you shortly.

17:15.317 --> 17:17.284
(flute music playing)

17:25.326 --> 17:27.194
What happened to me?

17:29.431 --> 17:32.266
When did I become
an old man

17:32.268 --> 17:34.835
baffled by modern
technology?

17:34.837 --> 17:37.004
Next thing you know,

17:37.006 --> 17:38.972
I'll be hitching my pants
up to my armpits

17:38.974 --> 17:41.008
and complaining about

17:41.010 --> 17:44.044
the awful music
the kids are listening to.

17:44.046 --> 17:47.214
It <i>is</i> awful, isn't it?

17:47.216 --> 17:49.383
Listen to that noise.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.221
Hang on, hang on.

17:54.223 --> 17:55.889
It's working!
I did it!

17:55.891 --> 17:56.824
How'd you do that?

17:56.826 --> 17:59.059
No idea, but
I did it!

18:01.429 --> 18:03.230
Maybe you shouldn't be
flying it inside.

18:03.232 --> 18:04.298
Well, I'm not flying it!

18:04.300 --> 18:05.599
Then who is?
I don't know!

18:05.601 --> 18:08.168
Must be getting a WiFi signal
from somewhere else!

18:11.940 --> 18:13.707
Initiate landing sequence!
Initiate landing sequence!

18:13.709 --> 18:15.242
(screams)

18:15.944 --> 18:17.578
Hey, the camera's working!

18:17.580 --> 18:18.645
Oh, look, it's me.

18:18.647 --> 18:20.481
(screams)

18:20.483 --> 18:23.050
(tech support talking
indistinctly over phone)

18:23.052 --> 18:26.587
Yes, it's a robot uprising!
Call the police!

18:37.467 --> 18:39.035
So you really think
they liked it?

18:39.036 --> 18:41.503
Oh, sweetie, it was
the best speech I...

18:41.505 --> 18:44.139
(both scream)

18:44.141 --> 18:46.075
Don't worry,
everyone in here is safe.
