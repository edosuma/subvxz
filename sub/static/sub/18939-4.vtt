<b>THE REPTILE ROOM</b>
part TWO

01:16.400 --> 01:18.608
<i>There's no word</i>
<i>to describe the feeling of waking up</i>

01:18.692 --> 01:21.733
<i>and knowing instantly
that something is terribly wrong.</i>

01:21.817 --> 01:24.275
<i>If there were, the Baudelaires
would have used that word</i>

01:24.358 --> 01:26.817
<i>when they rose to find
dawn had awoken them,</i>

01:26.900 --> 01:28.775
<i>and their Uncle Monty had not.</i>

01:43.650 --> 01:45.942
- Uncle Monty?
- Monty?

01:53.692 --> 01:55.567
- Uncle Monty?
- Are you in here?

02:06.650 --> 02:09.108
We all know that
our time in this world is limited,

02:09.192 --> 02:12.025
and that eventually all of us
will go to sleep, never to wake up.

02:18.108 --> 02:19.108
Monty...

02:19.192 --> 02:21.733
But that didn't change
how the Baudelaires felt that morning

02:21.817 --> 02:25.025
in the room their uncle
had filled so carefully with specimens,

02:25.108 --> 02:28.900
and in which he was now
a sort of specimen himself.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.483
How could this happen?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.608
We know exactly how this happened.

02:33.567 --> 02:38.025
My, my, my, my, my.

02:38.108 --> 02:42.983
What a terrible accident.
Whoever discovers this will be very upset.

02:43.483 --> 02:46.858
"For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come."

02:46.942 --> 02:48.150
You murdered him.

02:48.233 --> 02:51.108
Why, Klaus, I'm surprised.

02:51.192 --> 02:54.775
A smarty-pants boy like you
ought to be able to figure out that

02:54.858 --> 02:59.400
jolly old Uncle Monty died
from a snakebite, not murder.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.567
Look at the teeth marks on his cheek.

03:01.650 --> 03:05.733
Look at his cold, waxy face.

03:05.817 --> 03:07.983
- Look at his unblinking eyes.
- Stop it!

03:08.067 --> 03:09.567
Stop talking like that.

03:09.650 --> 03:12.525
You're right.
There's no time for chitchat.

03:12.608 --> 03:13.817
We have a ship to catch

03:13.900 --> 03:17.067
and I'd like to board in time
to have a bottle of wine before lunch.

03:18.817 --> 03:21.567
Peru. We're going to Peru.

03:21.650 --> 03:23.775
We wouldn't go
to the end of the driveway with you,

03:23.858 --> 03:25.858
much less international waters.

03:25.942 --> 03:29.608
Well, then I guess I'll have to
take my own luggage.

03:34.192 --> 03:35.567
Sunny!

03:35.650 --> 03:38.192
- Let her out this instant.
- She won't be able to breathe.

03:38.275 --> 03:40.192
I'm so tired of having to explain
everything to you.

03:40.275 --> 03:41.733
You're supposed to be so smart,

03:41.817 --> 03:44.442
and yet you persistently seem
to forget about this.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.317
I'll leave some breathing holes for her.

03:49.817 --> 03:50.942
- No!
- Stop!

03:51.025 --> 03:54.442
I'm kidding. That's not
the suitcase she's in. I don't think.

03:54.525 --> 03:55.942
Please don't hurt her.

03:56.025 --> 03:58.442
Then get in the car.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.525
Really, there's no one to blame
but yourselves.

04:14.608 --> 04:16.817
If you hadn't stranded me at the movies,

04:16.899 --> 04:19.442
I wouldn't have had to kill Monty
and we'd all be on our way to Peru,

04:19.524 --> 04:21.524
where I would have had to kill Monty.

04:21.608 --> 04:23.692
God, I hate driving stick.

04:23.775 --> 04:25.150
You're just gonna leave him there?

04:25.233 --> 04:27.150
Trust me, he doesn't mind.

04:27.233 --> 04:30.858
Of course, after they discover he's dead,
you'll be long gone,

04:30.942 --> 04:34.608
and I'll be taking advantage of
Peru's extremely lax guardianship laws.

04:34.692 --> 04:37.067
Why won't...
There we go.

04:40.150 --> 04:41.650
You can't take us out of the country.

04:42.358 --> 04:43.358
Can he?

04:43.942 --> 04:46.150
And who's going to stop me?

04:46.233 --> 04:48.567
Look out!

04:58.858 --> 05:02.275
It's extremely rare for an accident
to be a fortunate event.

05:02.358 --> 05:03.900
Luckily for the Baudelaires...

05:03.983 --> 05:07.067
Blasted furnaces of hell!

05:07.150 --> 05:09.817
<i>...this was one of those times.</i>

05:09.900 --> 05:11.025
What were you thinking,

05:11.108 --> 05:13.108
careening down that driveway
like a maniac?

05:13.192 --> 05:15.108
Me?
I was driving well below the speed limit.

05:15.192 --> 05:17.067
- Mr. Poe.
- Violet Baudelaire?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.233
- I'm so grateful you ran into us.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

05:19.317 --> 05:21.108
It was clearly the fault
of the other driver.

05:21.192 --> 05:23.942
I never...

05:24.025 --> 05:26.817
I thought there were three of you.
Ah, there's the baby.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.317
You're not Dr. Montgomery.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.150
My spleen!

05:31.233 --> 05:35.067
I think you've ruptured him.

05:38.150 --> 05:40.817
Hello, my name is Stephano.

05:40.900 --> 05:44.275
I'm Dr. Montgomery Montgomery's
new assistant.

05:44.358 --> 05:48.275
I mean, I was. I mean...
I don't know how to say it.

05:48.358 --> 05:50.317
- Uncle Monty's dead.
- That's how to say it.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.650
He's dead? But that... That's terrible.
How did it happen?

05:53.733 --> 05:55.358
He was bitten by a snake.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.900
I was on my way now to get the coroner.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.942
The children were too hysterical
to be left here alone.

06:00.025 --> 06:02.608
He wasn't taking us to a coroner.
He was taking us to Peru.

06:02.692 --> 06:05.650
What? Wha...? See? Hysterical.

06:05.733 --> 06:10.025
No, the children must be confused.
Dr. Montgomery was taking them to Peru.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.942
Last night he called me
to insist on me rearranging

06:13.025 --> 06:15.983
my morning itinerary
to bring them these passports.

06:16.067 --> 06:17.442
He'd want me to have them.

06:17.525 --> 06:20.067
Can't you see, Mr. Poe?
That's Count Olaf.

06:20.150 --> 06:22.400
He's in disguise
and he's trying to take us away.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.900
Who am I? What am I doing?

06:24.983 --> 06:28.275
Don't you miss
the vivid imagination of childhood?

06:28.358 --> 06:31.150
- I never had one.
- An imagination or a childhood?

06:32.858 --> 06:35.442
Children, you must be very distraught
about losing your uncle.

06:35.525 --> 06:39.567
Count Olaf is a terrible man
who tried to steal their fortune.

06:39.650 --> 06:40.858
- Really?
- Yes.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.942
And do I look
anything like this Count Olaf?

06:43.025 --> 06:44.525
No, you don't.

06:44.608 --> 06:47.483
Count Olaf has one long eyebrow
and he has a very short beard.

06:47.567 --> 06:49.067
You have a very long beard,

06:49.150 --> 06:51.775
and I hope you don't mind me saying so,
no eyebrows at all.

06:51.858 --> 06:54.442
- He shaved his eyebrow.
- And he let his beard grow.

06:54.525 --> 06:56.525
Can't you see? Anyone could see that.

06:59.108 --> 07:00.650
Sunny right.

07:00.733 --> 07:04.150
Count Olaf has a tattoo on his left ankle.
It looks like an eye.

07:05.983 --> 07:07.567
I hate to trouble you, sir,

07:07.650 --> 07:09.483
but just to put
the children's minds at ease,

07:09.567 --> 07:14.192
would you be so kind as to
show us your ankle?

07:18.400 --> 07:20.067
I'd be happy to.

07:53.567 --> 07:55.067
My apologies, Mr. Stephano.

07:55.817 --> 07:57.483
It's no problem.

07:57.567 --> 08:01.233
As long as the vehicle is operational,
then we really must be going.

08:01.317 --> 08:02.400
- No.
- No.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.775
- No?
- No.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.358
None of us are going anywhere
until the police have been called.

08:06.442 --> 08:08.317
Oh, come on, man.
It's just a fender bender.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.900
About Dr. Montgomery.

08:11.317 --> 08:13.317
What a sensible idea.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.900
It's quite urgent.

08:14.983 --> 08:18.192
First name, Montgomery.
Last name, Montgomery.

08:18.275 --> 08:21.567
No, this isn't a prank call.
Hello? Hello?

08:21.650 --> 08:24.317
I don't care if you have
an audition for <i>Equus.</i>

08:24.400 --> 08:26.192
Get over here now!

08:26.275 --> 08:28.150
I don't understand
how he got rid of his tattoo.

08:31.150 --> 08:33.775
Good news, I managed to get through
to the local sheriff's department.

08:33.857 --> 08:35.317
It seems there's an escaped cow

08:35.400 --> 08:37.232
from a local dairy farm
giving them the runaround,

08:37.317 --> 08:39.400
but they assured me they'll send someone
as soon as they're able.

08:50.567 --> 08:52.525
They must have made quick work
of that cow.

09:00.942 --> 09:02.400
May I help you, ma'am?

09:03.108 --> 09:04.692
Sir. Uh.

09:04.775 --> 09:06.025
I'm Nurse Lucafont.

09:06.108 --> 09:07.733
Nurse Lucafont.

09:07.817 --> 09:11.858
From the local sheriff's department's
medical examiner's office?

09:11.942 --> 09:13.483
From the local...

09:15.692 --> 09:20.025
I hear there's been
a terrible accident involving a snake.

09:20.108 --> 09:22.650
That was fast.
I only just now made the call.

09:22.733 --> 09:24.275
I believe, uh...

09:25.108 --> 09:28.942
speed is of the essence
in an emergency, sir.

09:31.817 --> 09:33.400
Could I get a cup of coffee?

09:34.817 --> 09:37.150
Don't you want to examine the body?

09:37.233 --> 09:39.317
Right, the body.
Lead the way.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.400
It's right over here in the Reptile Room.

09:46.317 --> 09:49.733
Excuse me, but why
are you wearing that mask over your face?

09:49.817 --> 09:53.733
I heard there were reptiles.
They... they might be contagious.

09:53.817 --> 09:57.692
Reptiles aren't contagious.
Are you sure you're a qualified nurse?

09:57.775 --> 09:59.733
Maybe the children should wait outside.

09:59.817 --> 10:02.942
Being in a room with a dead body
could be very traumatic.

10:03.025 --> 10:05.900
We've already been in a room
with a dead body thanks to you.

10:05.983 --> 10:08.692
Oh, yes, thank you, Stephano,
for that excellent point.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.400
I must say, you show genuine compassion
for these children.

10:12.483 --> 10:13.692
I appreciate it.

10:14.358 --> 10:16.567
Perhaps I will wait out here
with the children

10:16.650 --> 10:19.233
while you and Nurse Lucafont go in
and examine the body.

10:19.317 --> 10:20.483
The body?

10:21.442 --> 10:25.900
Ah, yes, perhaps we should both wait
with the children.

10:25.983 --> 10:28.233
I wouldn't want Nurse Lucafont
to be alone.

10:28.317 --> 10:31.942
Oh, I'm sure a nurse has seen
plenty of dead bodies.

10:32.025 --> 10:34.317
Maybe I can wait with the children, too.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.608
Well, that won't work.
Who will perform the examination?

10:36.692 --> 10:39.067
Why don't Klaus, Sunny and I
wait with Mr. Poe,

10:39.150 --> 10:42.108
while Stephano goes with Nurse Lucafont
to examine the body?

10:43.025 --> 10:45.358
No, child, please.

10:45.442 --> 10:51.150
If I were standing closer to you...
I would slap you in the throat.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.817
That does sound like the best plan.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.650
Fine. Right this way, nurse.

10:57.567 --> 11:02.692
But remember, I will be just
on the other side of this door.

11:05.275 --> 11:06.983
Oh, I'm sorry, children.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.608
Dr. Montgomery did seem like
an appropriate guardian for you.

11:10.692 --> 11:15.942
He was more than that.
He was much, much more than appropriate.

11:17.233 --> 11:20.900
Please don't let him be our new guardian.

11:20.983 --> 11:23.150
Oh, don't be silly, children.

11:23.233 --> 11:25.775
It is quite shocking
that Dr. Montgomery has died,

11:25.858 --> 11:30.150
but I'm not going to simply just hand you
and your fortune over to his assistant.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.192
Not without some very thorough paperwork.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.567
What's happened?
What's wrong?

11:44.650 --> 11:47.067
Nurse Lucafont was startled by a lizard.

11:47.150 --> 11:50.817
- It's a reptile room.
- I didn't know that meant literally.

11:50.900 --> 11:55.858
Anyway, you've come just in time.
The nurse has just finished her autopsy.

11:55.942 --> 11:58.483
- Did you determine the cause of death?
- Snakebite.

11:58.567 --> 11:59.900
Are you sure?

11:59.983 --> 12:03.608
Uh, two bite marks on his cheek.
Only a snake could've done that.

12:03.692 --> 12:06.900
- How terribly tragic. Case closed.
- But Uncle Monty is...

12:06.983 --> 12:09.400
was one of the world's
leading herpetologists.

12:09.483 --> 12:11.858
He would know better than
to let a dangerous snake bite him.

12:11.942 --> 12:13.608
I tested his blood.

12:13.692 --> 12:19.400
In his veins, I found the venom of one
of the most dangerous snakes in the world.

12:19.483 --> 12:21.233
Good heavens, which one?

12:21.317 --> 12:26.400
The incredibly deadly viper.

12:27.817 --> 12:29.150
That's impossible.

12:29.233 --> 12:31.942
The incredibly deadly viper
is one of the least dangerous

12:32.025 --> 12:34.358
and most friendly creatures
in the entire animal kingdom.

12:34.442 --> 12:37.858
Come now, Violet.
It's called the incredibly deadly viper.

12:37.942 --> 12:39.192
It's a misnomer.

12:39.275 --> 12:42.567
Uncle Monty named it that to scare his
colleagues at the Herpetological Society.

12:42.650 --> 12:46.317
He sounds highly unstable.
Not good guardian material.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.900
He was a wonderful, caring person.

12:48.983 --> 12:51.692
And the incredibly deadly viper
wouldn't hurt anyone and we can prove it.

12:51.775 --> 12:55.108
How can you prove it
when you don't even know where it is?

12:55.192 --> 12:58.275
Of course we know where it is.
It's... right...

12:58.358 --> 13:03.483
Hmm, fleeing the scene of a crime?
Highly suspicious.

13:05.067 --> 13:07.150
It's all falling into place.

13:07.233 --> 13:10.442
Dr. Montgomery must have forgotten
to lock the cage properly,

13:10.525 --> 13:13.567
allowing the viper to slip out
and kill him.

13:13.650 --> 13:15.775
I suppose we'll never know
what Dr. Montgomery did

13:15.858 --> 13:18.358
to trigger the bloodlust
in its reptile brain.

13:18.442 --> 13:20.442
I myself know nothing about snakes.

13:20.525 --> 13:23.817
I only got here just recently
and scarcely have had time to learn.

13:23.900 --> 13:27.233
But I hear the slimy creatures
can hold a grudge.

13:27.317 --> 13:29.608
That's the trouble with exotic pets.

13:29.692 --> 13:31.483
Maybe nature isn't meant to be tamed.

13:32.858 --> 13:34.358
What did you say your name was again?

13:34.983 --> 13:37.108
- I'm Doctor Lucafont.
- Nurse.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.275
- Nurse Lucafont.
- Sorry, uh, what was that?

13:39.358 --> 13:40.733
I'm Nurse Lucafont.

13:40.817 --> 13:42.150
I can't understand you under your mask.

13:42.233 --> 13:44.567
I said I'm Nurse Lucafont.

13:45.317 --> 13:47.233
Mr. Poe, that's not a nurse at all.

13:47.317 --> 13:49.108
It's one
of Count Olaf's accomplices.

13:49.192 --> 13:51.692
You mean the hook-handed man who worked
as my temporary secretary

13:51.775 --> 13:53.192
and broke the typewriter?

13:53.275 --> 13:55.192
- No.
- Well, I've never met any others.

13:55.275 --> 13:58.608
Besides, I'm sure Count Olaf
is hundreds of miles away.

13:58.692 --> 14:00.567
Or inches.

14:00.650 --> 14:02.733
Exactly. What was that?

14:02.817 --> 14:09.192
I mean, the incredibly deadly viper may be
inches away, ready to strike again.

14:09.275 --> 14:11.525
It's struck again.

14:14.775 --> 14:16.108
It's the screeching iguana clock.

14:16.192 --> 14:17.650
It struck again.

14:17.733 --> 14:22.317
Oh, will you look at the time?
Well, the <i>SS Prospero</i> departs at 5:00 p.m.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.275
You better go upstairs, children,
and pack for your Peruvian adventure.

14:25.358 --> 14:27.400
Mr. Poe, we can't go with Stephano.

14:27.483 --> 14:30.067
We don't have the proper paperwork
you mentioned.

14:30.150 --> 14:32.567
She's right.
You do seem like a good person,

14:32.650 --> 14:34.525
but the childrens' adventures
abroad will have to wait.

14:34.608 --> 14:35.900
Come on, we really need to be going.

14:37.192 --> 14:38.608
You're not going anywhere.

14:38.692 --> 14:40.483
And why not?

14:40.567 --> 14:42.442
Because no one is leaving this house

14:42.525 --> 14:46.317
with a snake on the loose.
Right, nurse?

14:47.192 --> 14:48.650
Yeah. Absolutely.

14:48.733 --> 14:50.942
- But that's absurd.
- That's absurd?

14:51.025 --> 14:53.942
I'm already late for the bank
and I'm up for a very important promotion.

14:54.025 --> 14:55.192
The bank will have to wait.

14:55.275 --> 14:57.067
When your back was turned just now,

14:57.150 --> 15:02.067
Nurse Lucafont informed me that
this entire place is under lockdown.

15:02.150 --> 15:05.858
- You mean...
- Yes! A quarantine!

15:06.858 --> 15:09.525
Your turn.

15:11.192 --> 15:13.150
What?

15:21.233 --> 15:24.233
A quarantine!

15:30.150 --> 15:32.692
How long is that going to take?

15:32.775 --> 15:35.275
Uh, the police.
It's in their hands now.

15:35.358 --> 15:37.108
Oh, that must be them.

15:37.858 --> 15:41.233
I must say, these are some impressive
response times for a house in the country.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.442
Mobile Crime Lab.

15:45.192 --> 15:46.275
At your service.

15:46.900 --> 15:48.733
- We always get our man.
- Or snake.

15:49.608 --> 15:52.525
- These are Count Olaf's accomplices.
- And they're all wearing costumes.

15:52.608 --> 15:53.900
No, children, these are adults.

15:53.983 --> 15:56.483
Adults don't wear costumes
unless it's for a charity ball,

15:56.567 --> 15:58.150
or they happen to be employed as actors.

15:58.233 --> 16:00.317
They are employed as actors.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.692
You two, create a perimeter.

16:01.775 --> 16:04.775
No one goes in or out of the house
until the reptile is caught.

16:04.858 --> 16:08.525
You two, get that body in the van and back
to the ME for some TLC before it's DOA.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.400
But you said no one could leave the house.

16:13.358 --> 16:15.858
I meant, uh, no one except you.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.067
Oh!

16:19.817 --> 16:22.983
Don't you recognize him?
That's the hook-handed man.

16:23.067 --> 16:25.358
And those two women were
in Count Olaf's play.

16:25.442 --> 16:28.108
Oh, children, it's rude to question
police authority.

16:28.192 --> 16:31.692
Besides, the women in that play had
ghastly theatrical makeup on their faces,

16:31.775 --> 16:35.275
and this man is opening a can of peaches
with hands, not hooks.

16:35.358 --> 16:37.775
That's Uncle Monty's food.
Stop eating his food.

16:37.858 --> 16:39.775
I was only gonna have a few peaches.

16:39.858 --> 16:43.608
The children lost their uncle today.
I'm sure you can understand.

16:43.692 --> 16:46.025
Violet, Klaus, Sunny,
why don't you wait upstairs.

16:46.108 --> 16:47.483
The adults will take care of it from here.

16:47.567 --> 16:48.858
But Mr. Poe...

16:48.942 --> 16:51.942
The adults will take care of it from here.

16:52.025 --> 16:53.275
Come on, Klaus.

16:53.358 --> 16:56.275
The adults won't take care of anything.
But we will.

17:04.692 --> 17:07.150
Now, please, work quickly.
I need to get back to the bank.

17:26.942 --> 17:29.733
If you have ever been left out of
an important conversation due to your age,

17:29.817 --> 17:32.233
then you know how the Baudelaires felt
as they trudged up the stairs,

17:32.317 --> 17:35.817
unable to participate in the conversation
that would determine their fate.

17:36.733 --> 17:38.733
So they decided to hold their own.

17:38.817 --> 17:41.817
We know the incredibly deadly viper
didn't kill Uncle Monty.

17:41.900 --> 17:44.858
And we know that Count Olaf did.
Mr. Poe would never believe us.

17:44.942 --> 17:46.442
Not without evidence and proof.

17:46.525 --> 17:47.775
Nurse Lucafont may be a fake nurse,

17:47.858 --> 17:50.608
but Uncle Monty had two bite marks
like a snake would make.

17:50.692 --> 17:51.817
I saw them this morning.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.317
I saw the incredibly deadly viper
this morning, too.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
It was in its cage.

17:55.483 --> 17:57.817
While we were at the parlor,
Count Olaf must have set it loose.

17:59.317 --> 18:00.343
This is terrible.

18:00.392 --> 18:02.425
I'm sure it's okay, Sunny.
I know you two were close.

18:02.436 --> 18:03.358
We bonded over biting.

18:03.608 --> 18:04.942
If we could find the snake...

18:05.025 --> 18:06.483
If we could find out
how Monty really died...

18:06.567 --> 18:09.358
- We could prove that it's innocent.
- And that Stephano is guilty.

18:09.442 --> 18:12.275
And Mr. Poe would have to have
Count Olaf arrested.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.608
We wouldn't have to go to Peru.

18:15.442 --> 18:18.150
If we'd found proof earlier,
maybe we could have saved Uncle Monty.

18:18.233 --> 18:20.525
If we put Count Olaf behind bars,

18:20.608 --> 18:22.900
we can still stop him
from harming anyone else.

18:22.983 --> 18:23.983
Including us.

18:24.067 --> 18:26.650
Do you think you can get back inside
the Reptile Room?

18:30.650 --> 18:32.150
I think I might have a way.

18:34.233 --> 18:37.275
It is now necessary for me
to use the hackneyed phrase,

18:37.358 --> 18:39.192
"meanwhile back at the ranch."

18:39.275 --> 18:40.608
The word "hackneyed" here means

18:40.692 --> 18:43.775
"used by so many writers,
it is a tiresome cliche,"

18:43.858 --> 18:46.192
while "meanwhile back at the ranch"
is a phrase used to link

18:46.275 --> 18:48.775
what is going on
in one part of a story with another part,

18:48.858 --> 18:51.400
and has nothing to do with cows
or creamy salad dressing.

18:51.483 --> 18:53.317
When I say, "Meanwhile back at the ranch,"

18:53.400 --> 18:56.692
what I mean is,
meanwhile, back in the Reptile Room,

18:56.775 --> 18:59.942
the adults were having
an adult conversation.

19:00.025 --> 19:03.192
If we place the peaches in a line
leading up to the cage,

19:03.275 --> 19:06.358
perhaps the snake will follow the trail
and then we can trap it inside.

19:06.442 --> 19:08.233
- Do snakes eat peaches?
- Yes.

19:08.317 --> 19:09.983
Maybe we can use the baby.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.942
Keep the banker distracted.

19:13.025 --> 19:15.067
Oh, you know,
these are so good for your skin.

19:15.150 --> 19:16.567
- Are they?
- You wanna try?

19:16.650 --> 19:18.150
- No, thank you. No, really.
- Ah...

19:18.233 --> 19:21.775
- I don't... No. Oh, that's...
- Mmm. Mmm!

19:37.817 --> 19:40.983
Oh, orphans, our ship awaits.

19:43.608 --> 19:45.025
Orphans?

19:56.775 --> 20:00.525
<i>"Labyrinth" is a word which</i>
<i>means "maze full of secrets and danger,"</i>

20:00.608 --> 20:01.942
<i>and if you're in ancient Greece,</i>

20:02.025 --> 20:05.233
"a monster that is half bull
and extremely unpleasant."

20:05.317 --> 20:07.692
The hedge labyrinth
behind Dr. Montgomery's house

20:07.775 --> 20:09.483
didn't contain a monster.

20:09.567 --> 20:10.983
But as Klaus looked down at it,

20:11.067 --> 20:14.692
seeing the way the hedges snaked
to form a familiar sinister eye,

20:14.775 --> 20:17.900
<i>it seemed to contain
both secrets and danger.</i>

20:18.400 --> 20:21.567
<i>Secrets their Uncle Monty
had promised to share...</i>

20:21.650 --> 20:24.483
and the danger of being
so high off the ground.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.275
The reptiles certainly seem...

20:28.358 --> 20:29.525
- Agitated.
- Annoyed.

20:29.608 --> 20:32.692
- Mmm. Maybe they're hungry.
- Maybe they're upset about the murder.

20:32.775 --> 20:35.025
Well, they're animals.
I hardly think they're aware of anything.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.942
Did you say "murder"?

20:37.025 --> 20:39.817
- I meant accident.
- Ah, yes, well...

20:39.900 --> 20:42.733
I'm certainly upset
about being late for the bank,

20:42.817 --> 20:45.442
so let's hurry this thing along.
Has anyone seen Stephano?

20:45.525 --> 20:48.108
Uh, he just went to make some coffee.

20:48.192 --> 20:49.817
Coffee. Oh, how considerate.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.858
Dr. Montgomery insisted I drive out here
first thing in the morning.

20:52.942 --> 20:57.108
That was when he was alive, of course,
and I didn't have time for my morning cup.

20:57.942 --> 20:59.608
I know how you feel.

20:59.692 --> 21:03.775
My boss made me come here right away.
I had to miss an important audition.

21:03.858 --> 21:05.192
Audition?

21:05.275 --> 21:08.400
I mean autopsy.
It's medical slang.

21:08.483 --> 21:11.692
- That seems strange.
- Oh, it's totally normal.

21:11.775 --> 21:14.233
We have lots of slang in the ol' med biz.

21:14.317 --> 21:16.525
That's slang for medical business.

21:16.608 --> 21:21.067
We call doctors "doc,"
and dead bodies "corpses."

21:21.150 --> 21:22.608
Ah, I suppose...

21:22.692 --> 21:24.233
Even though Uncle Monty's body
had been removed,

21:24.317 --> 21:27.983
the Reptile Room was not as inviting
to Klaus as it had been the day before.

21:28.900 --> 21:31.983
What happens in a certain place
can stain your feelings for it,

21:32.067 --> 21:34.817
just as ink can stain
a white sheet of paper.

21:37.692 --> 21:40.650
You can never forget
what transpired in that place...

21:41.608 --> 21:44.025
<i>just as words in ink
can never be unwritten.</i>

21:44.108 --> 21:46.275
Oh, perhaps I should check
on the children.

21:46.358 --> 21:48.233
Look over there!

21:48.317 --> 21:50.108
Where?
What am I looking at?

21:53.275 --> 21:55.692
It's the incredibly deadly viper.

21:55.775 --> 21:57.067
In that cage? But it's locked.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.442
Must've crawled inside.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.733
Locked the cage behind it.

21:59.817 --> 22:02.275
But a snake can't operate
a lock by itself.

22:02.358 --> 22:05.983
- Maybe a lizard helped it.
- That seems unlikely.

22:06.067 --> 22:09.067
Besides, that cage is clearly marked
"Virginian Wolfsnake."

22:09.150 --> 22:12.150
I must say, I'm beginning to doubt
your qualifications.

22:12.233 --> 22:13.900
I'm totally a nurse.

22:13.983 --> 22:16.025
Well, it does say so on your pin.

22:21.233 --> 22:24.233
- What was that?
- That didn't sound like a snake.

22:24.317 --> 22:25.858
Exactly.

22:27.567 --> 22:30.067
That's just
the screeching iguana clock.

22:30.150 --> 22:32.150
It was not the screeching iguana clock.

22:42.733 --> 22:44.400
<i>To fully understand the ghastly scene</i>

22:44.483 --> 22:46.108
<i>the adults discovered in the parlor,</i>

22:46.192 --> 22:48.692
<i>it is useful to once again use the phrase
"meanwhile back at the ranch,"</i>

22:48.775 --> 22:51.275
<i>which in this case means "upstairs."</i>

22:55.317 --> 22:56.900
<i>And about six minutes earlier.</i>

23:06.067 --> 23:08.900
Oh, orphans, our ship awaits.

23:11.025 --> 23:12.233
Orphans?

23:21.525 --> 23:24.233
<i>Years later,</i>
<i>Klaus Baudelaire would often lie in bed,</i>

23:24.317 --> 23:26.192
<i>filled with regret that he never yelled</i>

23:26.275 --> 23:28.983
<i>"That man is Count Olaf"
to his uncle at the movies,</i>

23:29.067 --> 23:31.358
<i>or over Chinese food,
or from under his canoe.</i>

23:31.442 --> 23:34.567
<i>And while I cannot say
that Violet slept any easier,</i>

23:34.650 --> 23:37.358
<i>she was luckier than her brother
in one respect.</i>

23:37.442 --> 23:42.108
She knew that the time to act was now.
And she would not regret it.

23:45.817 --> 23:48.358
You'll be comfortable here.
Do you think you can watch the door?

24:11.067 --> 24:13.233
Do you think you can help me out?

24:25.525 --> 24:26.733
Thanks, Sunny.

25:00.067 --> 25:01.317
Sunny?

25:01.900 --> 25:03.817
I'd say partly cloudy.

25:04.692 --> 25:07.150
I thought you were
supposed to be a nice girl.

25:07.233 --> 25:10.567
Nice girls aren't supposed to dig through
people's personal, private property.

25:10.650 --> 25:12.567
Especially when it's... Wasn't it locked?

25:12.650 --> 25:14.358
- It was.
- Oh, how clever.

25:14.442 --> 25:16.150
But I bet you're not clever enough
for this.

25:16.233 --> 25:18.608
I have four tickets with me
to Peru right now.

25:18.692 --> 25:20.317
I was going to take you and your siblings,

25:20.400 --> 25:22.608
because that's just
the kind of guardian I am.

25:23.983 --> 25:26.775
But I'll settle for one of you.

25:26.858 --> 25:29.983
That's the screeching iguana clock.

25:30.608 --> 25:32.108
What is...

25:40.275 --> 25:42.192
Which brings us back to...

25:43.650 --> 25:44.942
Goodness, golly, good God,

25:45.025 --> 25:48.233
Mary and Joseph, Zeus and Hera,
Nathaniel Hawthorne!

25:50.108 --> 25:52.317
- Which snake is it?
- It's the incredibly deadly viper.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.817
Don't touch her! Grab her!
Move closer! Run away!

25:54.900 --> 25:56.567
Kill the snake! Leave it alone!

25:56.650 --> 25:58.733
Give it some food! Don't let it bite her!

25:58.817 --> 26:02.942
It bit her!
It's bitten her! It bited her!

26:03.025 --> 26:05.525
Calm down! Get moving!
Call an ambulance!

26:05.608 --> 26:08.275
Call a scientist! Call my wife!

26:08.358 --> 26:09.817
This is ghastly!

26:09.900 --> 26:13.192
This is phantasmagorical!

26:13.275 --> 26:16.317
You are police officers! Do something!

26:16.400 --> 26:18.900
- It... it looks like the baby's playing.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:21.650 --> 26:23.275
With the incredibly deadly viper?

26:23.358 --> 26:27.025
From the expedition journal
of Dr. Montgomery Montgomery, April 24th.

26:27.108 --> 26:29.483
"The incredibly deadly viper
wouldn't hurt a fly.

26:29.567 --> 26:32.067
I know this because
I tried to feed it flies this morning.

26:32.150 --> 26:34.233
It is friendly and kind,
playful and smart,

26:34.317 --> 26:36.192
and if you can get past
your first impression,

26:36.275 --> 26:38.108
it can make a wonderful
addition to the family."

26:38.192 --> 26:40.650
And therefore,
it cannot have killed Uncle Monty.

26:40.733 --> 26:43.817
Well, I guess it does look
rather harmless.

26:43.900 --> 26:45.650
That doesn't change anything.

26:45.733 --> 26:48.650
There are still plenty of deadly types
of snakes in that room

26:48.733 --> 26:49.608
that could have done it.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.900
The mamba du mal bites as it strangles.

26:51.983 --> 26:55.025
The irascible python
is homicidally grumpy.

26:55.108 --> 26:58.858
The Virginian wolfsnake can bludgeon you
to death with a typewriter.

26:58.942 --> 27:00.525
How do you know?

27:00.608 --> 27:02.817
Because I read up on all types of snakes

27:02.900 --> 27:06.733
in the library section
of the Reptile Room.

27:06.817 --> 27:09.858
- Psst, boss.
- Don't interrupt me while I'm talking.

27:09.942 --> 27:15.483
If I may say so myself,
I am quite the expert on the snakes.

27:15.755 --> 27:16.400
Aha!

27:16.650 --> 27:19.442
What does it say?

27:19.525 --> 27:21.983
She said, "Ah-ha!"
because she's figured something out.

27:22.067 --> 27:23.775
I myself know nothing about snakes.

27:23.858 --> 27:25.942
You said you didn't know
anything about snakes.

27:26.025 --> 27:28.275
I... That is...

27:28.358 --> 27:31.525
That's right.
Stephano, explain...

27:38.192 --> 27:39.858
- We need a plan.
- Should we kill him?

27:39.942 --> 27:42.067
He is coughing a lot.
Let's see if he dies of natural causes.

27:42.150 --> 27:44.983
Mmm.

27:46.692 --> 27:48.108
Explain yourself.

27:48.192 --> 27:52.233
The reason that I said
I did not know anything about the snakes,

27:52.317 --> 27:54.692
is because I was being modest.

27:54.775 --> 27:55.858
You weren't being modest.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.983
You haven't been modest
a day in your life. You were lying.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.567
Klaus, you can't speak
to an adult that way.

27:59.650 --> 28:00.983
And he's lying now.

28:01.067 --> 28:03.442
He's a liar and a murderer
and he killed Uncle Monty.

28:03.525 --> 28:06.275
You have no proof.

28:07.567 --> 28:08.567
Yes, we do.

28:11.025 --> 28:12.108
What is all this?

28:12.192 --> 28:14.608
Evidence, which I found
in Stephano's suitcase.

28:14.692 --> 28:15.942
She picked the lock.

28:16.025 --> 28:18.025
- Violet, is that true?
- It was an emergency.

28:18.108 --> 28:20.025
Nice girls shouldn't know
how to do that sort of thing.

28:20.108 --> 28:21.108
That's what I said.

28:21.192 --> 28:24.483
My sister is a nice girl... and she knows
how to do all sorts of things.

28:24.567 --> 28:26.400
We'll discuss this later.
Please continue.

28:26.483 --> 28:29.608
When Uncle Monty died,
we were immediately suspicious.

28:29.692 --> 28:33.025
We were positive
that Stephano killed Uncle Monty.

28:33.108 --> 28:35.442
But there were bite marks on his cheek
clearly from a snake.

28:35.525 --> 28:36.817
That stumped me, too.

28:36.900 --> 28:38.900
That's why I decided
to search Stephano's suitcase.

28:38.983 --> 28:41.442
I knew he wouldn't want to leave
any evidence behind.

28:41.525 --> 28:43.358
And that's when I found these.

28:43.442 --> 28:47.025
But that's nothing.
It's my random junk collection,

28:47.108 --> 28:49.900
which is private property,
illegally obtained,

28:49.983 --> 28:51.650
and therefore not admissible in court.

28:51.733 --> 28:54.942
It does look like junk.
But that's when I noticed this.

28:55.025 --> 28:58.775
Uncle Monty told us that he keeps
venom samples in his cabinet

28:58.858 --> 29:01.400
from every venomous snake known to man.

29:01.483 --> 29:03.775
- And woman.
- And woman.

29:03.858 --> 29:06.692
Mr. Poe, I believe if you open
that cabinet right there,

29:06.775 --> 29:09.233
you'll find a sample is missing.

29:10.150 --> 29:11.817
There's an empty spot on the shelf.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.608
The label says "Mamba du Mal."

29:14.692 --> 29:18.025
"The mamba du mal is one of
the deadliest snakes in the hemisphere,

29:18.108 --> 29:19.692
known for its powerful venom."

29:20.425 --> 29:21.208
Aha!

29:21.358 --> 29:22.483
Then it's obvious.

29:22.567 --> 29:26.817
The mamba du mal got out of its cage,
stole a vial of its own venom,

29:26.900 --> 29:29.192
and murdered Dr. Montgomery
in cold blood.

29:29.275 --> 29:30.192
Ah-ha!

29:30.983 --> 29:32.317
Wait, that's ridiculous.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.483
- But the bite marks...
- Aren't bite marks at all.

29:35.567 --> 29:38.233
When I first saw these items,
I wasn't sure how they fit together.

29:38.317 --> 29:41.400
So, I concentrated on each item
as if they were parts of a machine.

29:41.483 --> 29:44.025
And that's when I realized
they fit together.

29:44.108 --> 29:47.900
Ladies and gentlemen, the murder weapon.

29:49.067 --> 29:50.108
- Incredible!
- Astounding!

29:50.192 --> 29:54.108
Stephano used this double-barrel syringe
to inject the venom into Uncle Monty,

29:54.192 --> 29:58.025
to simulate the double puncture marks
of a snake.

29:58.108 --> 30:00.817
Then he disassembled it
to hide the evidence.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.400
But I loved Dr. Montgomery.

30:02.483 --> 30:04.400
What motive would I possibly have
to murder him?

30:04.483 --> 30:06.483
He's after the Baudelaire fortune.

30:06.567 --> 30:08.650
How would Stephano even know
about the Baudelaire fortune?

30:08.733 --> 30:10.983
I thought they were penniless orphans.

30:11.067 --> 30:13.192
They certainly dress
like penniless orphans.

30:13.275 --> 30:16.192
That's because everything we owned
burned up in a fire.

30:16.775 --> 30:18.858
But you already know about that...

30:18.942 --> 30:22.025
because you're not Stephano,
you're Count Olaf.

30:23.442 --> 30:27.192
The kid detective thing is cute,
but we have already dismissed that theory.

30:27.275 --> 30:28.775
We'll see about that.

30:30.108 --> 30:32.400
Your left ankle, sir.

30:32.483 --> 30:34.150
Don't come near me with that thing.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.400
You've been coughing germs
into it all day.

30:36.483 --> 30:38.275
Oh, if you're really
who the children say you are,

30:38.358 --> 30:40.067
then germs are the least of your problem.

30:40.150 --> 30:43.692
Your left ankle... please.

30:46.775 --> 30:48.442
If you insist.

31:19.108 --> 31:22.525
For the first time in my life,
I'm happy to see that awful tattoo.

31:27.317 --> 31:28.567
Bravo, children.

31:29.650 --> 31:32.942
Yes, I admit it. I killed Monty.

31:33.025 --> 31:37.525
I also killed his assistant, Gustav.
I drowned him in the reflecting pond.

31:37.608 --> 31:41.692
The question is...
what are you going to do about it?

31:41.775 --> 31:45.983
I'm going to send you to jail
for a very long time.

31:46.067 --> 31:48.025
Officers, arrest this man!

31:50.775 --> 31:53.025
No, office... Officers.

31:53.108 --> 31:54.525
Oh, you're all in on it, aren't you?

31:55.275 --> 31:57.067
Oh. Oh, dear.

31:57.150 --> 31:59.567
If this were a piece of filmed
entertainment for small children

31:59.650 --> 32:01.942
you would know what happens next.

32:02.025 --> 32:04.358
With the villain's identity
and evil plan exposed,

32:04.442 --> 32:05.733
the police would arrive on the scene

32:05.817 --> 32:07.358
and place him in jail
for the rest of his life.

32:07.442 --> 32:09.442
The plucky youngsters
would go out for pizza.

32:09.525 --> 32:13.525
But I can tell you that's as likely
as Dr. Montgomery returning to life.

32:13.608 --> 32:16.317
Still, while Dr. Montgomery
may be dead...

32:16.400 --> 32:20.108
If you don't mind,
I'll be taking the children with me.

32:20.192 --> 32:22.358
<i>the reptiles in his collection...</i>

32:23.733 --> 32:25.108
<i>were very much alive.</i>

32:26.400 --> 32:27.567
Oh.

32:27.650 --> 32:29.983
Boss.

32:31.067 --> 32:33.733
That's just the screeching iguana clock.

32:33.817 --> 32:36.275
It's not the screeching iguana clock.

32:36.358 --> 32:37.942
It's the screeching iguana!

32:51.525 --> 32:53.317
Take the van.
Make sure they follow you.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.192
- But where are you going, boss?
- International waters.

33:04.525 --> 33:06.442
Count Olaf is driving away.

33:06.525 --> 33:08.942
No, he's not.
He's heading into the labyrinth.

33:11.567 --> 33:13.483
I suppose there wasn't room in the van.

33:13.567 --> 33:14.942
What are you waiting for?
Go after him!

33:15.025 --> 33:17.692
This is a job for the police.

33:17.775 --> 33:19.567
I'll go call them. I'm sure they'll...

33:20.192 --> 33:21.942
set up a roadblock, or something.

33:22.817 --> 33:24.358
He's not getting away.

33:28.608 --> 33:29.692
Go right.

33:56.567 --> 33:58.317
You go that way. We can cut him off.

34:17.317 --> 34:18.317
It's a dead end.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.567
That's impossible.
We can retrace our steps.

34:21.650 --> 34:24.775
What's the point? It's all wrong.

34:24.858 --> 34:26.733
Count Olaf escaped.
Uncle Monty is dead.

34:26.817 --> 34:29.400
We never got to go to Peru or say goodbye.

34:29.483 --> 34:31.483
Or ask him about this.

34:31.567 --> 34:33.192
Klaus, what is that?

34:33.275 --> 34:34.942
It's Uncle Monty's handwriting.

34:35.025 --> 34:36.942
He must have copied it down
during the movie.

34:37.025 --> 34:38.233
We were right next to him.

34:38.317 --> 34:39.942
If he got a message,
we would've seen it.

34:40.025 --> 34:41.733
Not if he had some secret way
to receive it.

34:41.817 --> 34:45.650
Do you remember that strange object
I found in the fire? I think it's...

34:45.733 --> 34:46.983
It's gone.

34:47.067 --> 34:49.483
I'll be taking the children with me.

34:51.317 --> 34:52.442
Count Olaf.

35:07.067 --> 35:09.150
A good labyrinth is full of secrets.

35:09.233 --> 35:11.775
- Who are you?
- Why are you dressed as a statue?

35:11.858 --> 35:14.025
Both excellent questions, Baudelaires.

35:14.108 --> 35:15.817
You're that actress
from the weird zombie movie.

35:15.900 --> 35:17.192
You work for Mr. Poe.

35:17.275 --> 35:18.733
It's more of a volunteer position.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.150
I'm sorry I arrived too late
to help your uncle.

35:21.233 --> 35:23.233
But I can still bring Count Olaf
to justice.

35:23.317 --> 35:25.150
Uncle Monty
had a spyglass like that.

35:25.233 --> 35:27.650
What was he trying to tell us?
What's in Peru?

35:27.733 --> 35:29.192
Forget Peru. It's been compromised.

35:29.275 --> 35:32.775
Who sent him the message?
Who were we supposed to meet there?

35:32.858 --> 35:34.525
I know you children have
a great many questions,

35:34.608 --> 35:36.858
and I promise there are
a great many answers.

35:36.942 --> 35:40.275
Find your Aunt Josephine.
She's a fierce and formidable woman.

35:40.358 --> 35:43.067
She can keep you safe
and tell you everything you need to know.

35:43.150 --> 35:44.608
Let me handle Count Olaf.

35:45.275 --> 35:49.317
Count Olaf stole something from me.
I think it's part of a spyglass.

35:49.400 --> 35:50.775
It certainly is.

35:50.858 --> 35:54.358
I will get it back to you,
Klaus Baudelaire. I promise.

36:14.983 --> 36:16.025
Who are you?

36:16.108 --> 36:18.233
What are they doing
with Uncle Monty's reptiles?

36:18.317 --> 36:20.983
After I called the police,
I rang up the Herpetological Society.

36:21.067 --> 36:23.942
They kindly offered to retrieve
Dr. Montgomery's reptiles.

36:24.025 --> 36:25.317
"Retrieve" means "take away."

36:25.400 --> 36:27.567
We know what retrieve means.
Where are they taking them?

36:27.650 --> 36:30.192
Well, they're orphans now.
So they'll be moving on to other homes

36:30.275 --> 36:32.942
where their guardians hopefully
won't die on them like Dr. Montgomery.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.442
Can we at least say goodbye?

36:34.525 --> 36:35.692
After what you've been through,

36:35.775 --> 36:38.567
I'd think you'd never want to see
a reptile again.

36:38.650 --> 36:40.733
Besides, I have to take you
to your next guardian.

36:40.817 --> 36:43.067
- No!
- No! We know where we're going.

36:43.150 --> 36:47.358
I know where you're going, too.
And I'm the adult so I get to decide.

36:47.442 --> 36:49.650
- We're going to our Aunt Josephine.
- To your Aunt Josephine.

36:50.567 --> 36:51.900
She's next on the list.

37:09.317 --> 37:12.525
Mr. Poe, what can you tell us
about your secretary?

37:12.608 --> 37:13.733
Oh, terrible disappointment.

37:13.817 --> 37:16.025
He turned out to be working
for Count Olaf. Surely you remember.

37:16.108 --> 37:19.900
- No, your other secretary.
- Who? Oh, Jacquelyn.

37:19.983 --> 37:23.817
Excellent typist. Unfortunate habit
of disappearing for days at a time.

37:23.900 --> 37:26.025
I don't make it a habit of socializing
with employees,

37:26.108 --> 37:27.733
so that's really all I know.

37:28.442 --> 37:31.442
Other than the fact that she came
highly recommended by your parents.

38:16.233 --> 38:18.067
Telegram for a Mr. Count Olaf?

38:18.150 --> 38:20.650
It's just Count Olaf.

38:20.733 --> 38:23.025
Count is my honorific.

38:23.108 --> 38:27.233
Calling me "Mr." is not only redundant,
it's an insult to my station.

38:27.317 --> 38:28.442
Who...

38:29.233 --> 38:33.067
Well, we meet again.
You might want to ease up on the bronzer.

38:33.150 --> 38:35.608
I hope you don't think
you're going to Peru.

38:36.942 --> 38:38.400
Yessica Haircut.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.817
I find it helpful to leave the country
now and then.

38:40.900 --> 38:44.692
See some ruins, wait for the manhunt
to die down, eat some cuy.

38:44.775 --> 38:48.567
You won't be eating any cuy,
unless it's served in a prison cafeteria.

38:48.650 --> 38:50.525
Why would I be eating
in a prison cafeteria?

38:50.608 --> 38:51.942
Because I'm taking you to prison.

38:52.025 --> 38:53.900
Well, good luck with that. I'm armed.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.692
Hmm. So am I.

38:55.775 --> 38:59.442
- Hmm. Child's play.
- Adorable.

39:00.775 --> 39:02.942
Is that a harpoon gun?

39:03.025 --> 39:04.442
You'd never use it.

39:04.525 --> 39:07.150
One of your great gifts
is your eminent compassion.

39:07.233 --> 39:09.025
You wouldn't squash a spider.

39:09.108 --> 39:11.317
I like spiders.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.650
Well, that's good, because there's one
on your shoulder right now.

39:13.733 --> 39:14.858
I'm not falling for that.

39:14.942 --> 39:16.525
No, no, I'm serious.
It's on your left shoulder.

39:16.608 --> 39:19.192
It's one of the bigger ones.
I wanna say tarantula? Ugh.

39:25.817 --> 39:29.192
You're not going anywhere, you snake.

39:29.275 --> 39:33.650
You're forgetting, my dear Jacquelyn,
snakes shed their skin.

39:47.817 --> 39:50.650
<i>There are times</i>
<i>when the entire world seems wrong.</i>

39:51.150 --> 39:54.692
The way a reptile room
without any reptiles...

39:56.275 --> 39:57.733
seems wrong.

40:02.525 --> 40:06.650
The way a bookshelf without any books
seems wrong.

40:08.942 --> 40:10.650
Or a loved one's house...

40:11.650 --> 40:13.067
without the loved one.

40:13.858 --> 40:16.567
<i>The Baudelaires weren't given much time
with their Uncle Monty,</i>

40:16.650 --> 40:18.233
<i>which seemed wrong.</i>

40:18.317 --> 40:19.983
<i>Still, for the first time in a long time,</i>

40:20.067 --> 40:23.025
<i>they'd found a place
where the world seemed right,</i>

40:23.108 --> 40:25.067
<i>if only for a short time.</i>

40:26.900 --> 40:30.900
If they'd found that once,
who's to say they couldn't find it again?

40:52.692 --> 40:54.983
- He's not answering.
- Sure you've got the right number?

40:55.067 --> 40:57.108
Operator, can you check
that number again, please?

40:57.192 --> 40:58.650
It's quite urgent.

40:58.733 --> 41:02.150
Yes. Thank you. First name, Montgomery.
Last name, Montgomery.

41:02.233 --> 41:04.525
No, this isn't a crank call.

41:13.525 --> 41:15.525
Can I put you on hold for a moment?

41:22.483 --> 41:25.608
Which of you gentlemen knows
where we might charter a plane?

41:27.200 --> 41:30.200
