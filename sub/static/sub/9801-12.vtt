00:35.891 --> 00:38.020
Cute and cuddly boys!

00:45.421 --> 00:48.221
Feliratozta: Katze

00:48.222 --> 00:51.022
Jó szórakozást!

00:56.466 --> 00:58.364
To get to raincloud city,

00:58.365 --> 01:00.562
I need my magic hairbrush.

01:00.563 --> 01:04.361
Search the robot. I don't trust
those blinky eyes.

01:04.361 --> 01:08.225
That's right! It's in the insciented wardrobe.

01:08.226 --> 01:11.566
Forget the hairbrush!
Don't turn your back on blinky!

01:12.960 --> 01:15.340
You call this educational TV?

01:15.341 --> 01:16.616
It's the Lunicorns.

01:16.617 --> 01:18.738
They teach all about the wonders of imaginaton,

01:18.739 --> 01:21.507
good citizenship, and proper grooming.

01:22.170 --> 01:26.171
Ohh, are we all in favour of never letting
Private pick the channel again?

01:26.172 --> 01:27.441
- I!
- no!

01:27.442 --> 01:29.504
Another big win for democracy.

01:29.505 --> 01:30.694
Zap!

01:30.695 --> 01:32.557
Shirtless ninja
action theater!

01:32.558 --> 01:34.436
Ohh, now that's more like it.

01:34.437 --> 01:35.419
Yes!

01:35.420 --> 01:37.155
We'll be right after the special
commercial.

01:37.156 --> 01:38.853
- What?
- Oh!

01:38.854 --> 01:41.577
Miss Perky you are my best friend.

01:41.578 --> 01:45.422
What?

01:45.423 --> 01:47.293
I love you too.

01:48.257 --> 01:50.949
Miss Perky you can talk!

01:50.950 --> 01:51.987
That's right kids.

01:51.988 --> 01:53.678
Thanks to advanced
voice chip technology

01:53.713 --> 01:56.174
new, chatty Miss Perky
can really talk!

01:56.175 --> 01:59.908
A voice chip? But that takes all the magic out of game pretend

01:59.909 --> 02:01.802
Who didn't want a chatty...

02:02.587 --> 02:04.965
blah,blah...

02:06.373 --> 02:09.189
Ehi, ehi! You Ehi you!

02:10.545 --> 02:13.301
Kowalski, lovesick psycho options.

02:13.302 --> 02:16.782
I believe I could convert your doll to the talking design.

02:16.783 --> 02:18.455
Of course I need a voice chip

02:18.456 --> 02:20.916
from one of the new chatty models
but any toystore should...

02:27.030 --> 02:28.919
Come on! Lets go already!

02:30.858 --> 02:32.767
I have a visual on the voice chips.

02:32.768 --> 02:35.026
And not a human around.

02:35.027 --> 02:36.283
Roll out!

02:42.258 --> 02:43.906
Okay guys, it's nine o'clock.

02:43.907 --> 02:46.282
Unbolt the doors and stand back.

02:52.753 --> 02:55.825
A talking penguin?
What is this 2005?

02:59.227 --> 03:01.530
Maybe at a different toystore..

03:07.011 --> 03:09.563
Perhaps direct from the factory.

03:20.582 --> 03:22.067
Chatty Miss Perky

03:22.068 --> 03:23.799
must be the hottest toy on the market.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.500
Maybe it's for the best, Rico.

03:25.501 --> 03:30.508
No voice chip could ever compare
with the magic of your own imagination

03:31.979 --> 03:33.499
Store your grum soldier.

03:33.500 --> 03:37.087
Looks like those sharks missed
some moulded plastic chunks

03:42.301 --> 03:46.141
False allarm. Just a bunch of those
TV moonhorses

03:46.817 --> 03:48.820
The Lunicorns!

03:51.124 --> 03:55.084
Princess Selfrespectra!
Prince Chancealot!

03:55.085 --> 03:56.743
They're all here!

03:56.744 --> 03:59.831
Well I'm surprised everyone is not
swarming over these toys instead

03:59.832 --> 04:02.710
Yes That's a real puzzler.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.489
Duck! The fenzy has began !

04:05.490 --> 04:08.158
Ahh geez, another one of those
floofy horsy things

04:08.159 --> 04:10.543
came back unsold?

04:10.544 --> 04:13.064
Oh well, melty, melty!

04:20.704 --> 04:24.001
I just can't stand to see the poor maniac down like this.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.381
Not even the awesome mind
of science can

04:26.382 --> 04:28.556
make his doll speak
without a voice chip.

04:28.557 --> 04:31.580
Oh well, it's past bed time for me then now.

04:31.581 --> 04:32.639
Private's right.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.489
Better to tackle this after 
a good night shut eye

04:37.402 --> 04:38.699
Private.

04:38.700 --> 04:41.459
What? I had to save one Lunicorn.

04:41.460 --> 04:42.751
Just one.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.567
I didn't know she'd glow in the dark.

04:45.590 --> 04:47.267
Hugs for everyone!

04:47.268 --> 04:49.081
I didn't know she could do that either!

04:49.466 --> 04:53.733
Obviously it is equipted with 
some sort of voice...chip

04:53.822 --> 04:57.177
A horsey to dolly voice chip transplant?

04:57.178 --> 04:58.475
Are you mad?

04:58.476 --> 05:00.796
Well with great risk comes great reward.

05:00.797 --> 05:03.383
All I ask, is that you'd be as gentle

05:03.384 --> 05:05.520
as the Lunicorns themselves?

05:05.521 --> 05:08.995
Oh, then... you may wanna sleep 
through this one

05:21.039 --> 05:23.165
Ahh, I was wondering where
 that rolled off to.

05:27.306 --> 05:29.239
Rise and shine, Rico.

05:29.274 --> 05:32.277
It's time to meet your new and 
improved dolly 

05:32.763 --> 05:35.052
Go on, give her a little squeeze.

05:35.651 --> 05:37.733
You're very special to me.

05:39.377 --> 05:41.343
Friends don't judge friends.

05:41.344 --> 05:43.495
Your heart is beautiful.

05:47.415 --> 05:50.878
Everybody welcome in the imagi-nation.

05:53.990 --> 05:56.629
Hey, pretty lady!

05:57.214 --> 06:01.628
Why don't you drop that thing and 
get with the king?

06:01.629 --> 06:02.991
Say what?

06:03.184 --> 06:05.779
No, no. I was talking to the pretty lady.

06:05.780 --> 06:09.373
You hear me talking 
with those pretty ears?

06:09.533 --> 06:11.211
Pretty lady?

06:12.143 --> 06:13.890
You sure you wanna be doin' that?

06:13.891 --> 06:18.327
Oh no, it's ok because
she is attractive, and I am wooing her.

06:18.328 --> 06:19.594
Check this out, check it!

06:19.595 --> 06:23.544
He-ey baby, was your mama a fighter pilot?

06:23.545 --> 06:27.121
Because when she had you, 
she dropped a bomb.

06:27.677 --> 06:30.085
Check it, I got another one Morice.
Watch this.

06:30.086 --> 06:32.793
Hey baby, does your face hurt?

06:32.794 --> 06:34.569
Because it's killing me.

06:37.086 --> 06:39.706
When you hurt others,
you only hurt yourself.

06:39.707 --> 06:40.422
Huh?

06:40.423 --> 06:43.097
Yes! Yes, listen to the 
plastic lady.

06:45.341 --> 06:48.210
Be nice to everyone
and everyone will be nice to you.

06:48.819 --> 06:49.741
What's that all about?

06:49.742 --> 06:51.649
Hey, wait, wait hold on for a second, budy.

06:51.650 --> 06:54.933
Have you never had a talking 
lady friend before?

06:55.533 --> 06:56.320
No.

06:56.321 --> 06:58.587
Then listen up to king Julien.

06:58.588 --> 07:03.273
The lady friends, they like to tell you all kinds of crazy things,right?

07:03.274 --> 07:06.306
But there is a simple way to
 deal with all of this.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.654
Do everything she says
and shut up about it, okay?

07:10.740 --> 07:11.933
Okay.

07:12.366 --> 07:13.562
Negative!

07:13.563 --> 07:17.085
We do not take dollies on 
undercover missions.

07:17.086 --> 07:20.378
Fun gets bigger 
when you share it.

07:21.337 --> 07:24.001
All right. Just this once.

07:24.786 --> 07:28.191
But tell her to keep her profile low and
and her voice chip shut.

07:28.192 --> 07:29.538
Alright!

07:33.682 --> 07:35.976
Coming up make a left.

07:36.416 --> 07:39.059
You never be lost if 
you follow your heart.

07:39.078 --> 07:40.310
Okay.

07:40.676 --> 07:43.131
I said left. Left!

07:49.739 --> 07:54.977
Once again it should be the first left then...

07:55.523 --> 07:57.300
Hurray for puppies!

07:57.365 --> 07:58.443
Hey, there is a puppy.

07:58.444 --> 08:00.642
No, Rico! These aren't puppies!

08:04.370 --> 08:08.131
I call rainbows upside-down colour smiles.

08:08.672 --> 08:11.390
Commando! Not command dolly!

08:11.391 --> 08:14.777
Think about that and let me know when
you get your head on straight.

08:16.791 --> 08:22.612
Always listen to the lady friend.

08:22.652 --> 08:25.950
In addition to echoic flashback voices

08:25.951 --> 08:27.899
I also do impressions.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.151
Check it out. This is Mort.

08:30.356 --> 08:35.716
I like feet because I'm a dumb-dumb head. Yay!

08:35.717 --> 08:37.629
That was dead-on right?

08:37.955 --> 08:42.225
I love flowers, moonbeams and
non-violent protest.

08:45.508 --> 08:49.030
What in the name of incense and peppermints?

08:49.031 --> 08:50.212
No.

08:50.213 --> 08:52.622
No. No!

08:52.623 --> 08:53.893
What is it Skipper?

08:54.453 --> 08:55.847
He is gone...

08:56.212 --> 08:57.330
hippie!

08:57.331 --> 08:58.723
Peace man.

08:58.724 --> 09:00.692
What have you done, soldier?

09:00.693 --> 09:02.889
No Skipper, we did this.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.586
That Lunicorn chip never belonged

09:04.587 --> 09:06.494
in a Miss Perky doll.

09:06.495 --> 09:10.625
It violates all laws of nature and
injection moulded plastic!

09:10.626 --> 09:12.353
I do like his shirt.

09:12.824 --> 09:16.038
Tell me there is an antidote for this
lovey-dovey brain poisining.

09:16.039 --> 09:19.434
I suggest 20 cc of
senseless destruction, stat.

09:19.435 --> 09:22.088
Come on Rico, come. 
Lets go blow something up.

09:22.227 --> 09:24.885
Ah-ah. Back off, baby.

09:24.886 --> 09:28.378
Yeah? 
What are you going to do moonbeam?

09:28.691 --> 09:30.692
It's good to be good.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.519
I thought hippies were non-violent.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.229
Heh, what are going to do?

09:34.643 --> 09:36.890
Please and thank you are magic words.

09:36.891 --> 09:38.822
Stop that hippie!

09:42.611 --> 09:43.716
Rainbows.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.016
Sunshine.

09:45.887 --> 09:46.892
Flowers.

09:46.893 --> 09:49.215
Moonbeams, smiles.

09:50.692 --> 09:51.858
puppies.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.762
Lets go to raincloud city.

09:53.763 --> 09:54.585
Okay.

09:54.586 --> 09:55.911
Stop!

09:55.912 --> 09:58.396
You've twisted everything the 
Lunicorns stand for

09:58.397 --> 10:00.900
but there is one thing you can't defeat.

10:05.652 --> 10:07.891
All you need is star kisses, moonhugs,

10:07.892 --> 10:12.339
and a pixie ticket to the peaceful land of imagi-nation.

10:12.340 --> 10:14.419
Lunicorn!

10:20.736 --> 10:22.337
Rico, compadre...

10:22.338 --> 10:24.736
I know that doll's words sound sweet

10:24.771 --> 10:27.947
but they're built on a Unicorn fuelled lie.

10:27.948 --> 10:32.740
Are you prepared to throw away our entire brotherhood over that ?

10:32.741 --> 10:33.473
Yup.

10:33.474 --> 10:35.070
Lets be special friends.

10:35.271 --> 10:36.870
Say what?

10:37.334 --> 10:38.987
Friends? Oh, no!

10:38.988 --> 10:41.344
That's girl code for: 
I never want to see you again

10:41.345 --> 10:45.146
Rico I..I think she is breaking up with you.

10:46.086 --> 10:47.618
Lets be friends.

10:47.627 --> 10:49.254
Friends, friends

10:49.255 --> 10:51.259
Special friends.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.231
Chin up, soldier!

11:04.232 --> 11:06.314
You're a real catch.

11:06.315 --> 11:08.149
I'm sure one day she'll come around.

11:08.150 --> 11:10.422
What's that Miss Perky?

11:10.423 --> 11:13.196
You say you've changed your mind?

11:13.197 --> 11:17.600
I love Rice just the way he is.

11:23.983 --> 11:26.100
Well score one for imagination after all.

11:26.101 --> 11:27.729
Hurra!

11:27.730 --> 11:29.894
And the voice chip evidence?

11:29.895 --> 11:31.854
Already disposing of it.

11:33.483 --> 11:35.540
You're very special to me.

11:37.052 --> 11:39.710
Right back at you, baby.

11:40.118 --> 11:41.372
Quiet, Maurice!

11:41.373 --> 11:43.913
I am wooing the smoothy.

11:44.305 --> 11:50.928
