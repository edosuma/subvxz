WEBVTT

00:03.989 --> 00:07.325
crash-landed on Earth. We
came here seeking refuge,

00:07.375 --> 00:09.205
but the humans thought
that it was an invasion.

00:11.942 --> 00:14.924
That night, I met a human
girl who tried to protect me...

00:14.974 --> 00:16.787
a girl I never thought I'd see again.

00:16.837 --> 00:19.785
The surviving members
of my race, the Atrians,

00:19.835 --> 00:22.995
were rounded up and isolated
inside a militarized sector.

00:23.045 --> 00:24.959
Now it's 2024.

00:25.009 --> 00:27.077
Seven of us have been
chosen to attend high school

00:27.127 --> 00:29.637
as a part of a government
integration program.

00:29.687 --> 00:31.102
But the humans and Atrians

00:31.152 --> 00:33.287
continue to distrust each other,

00:33.337 --> 00:36.132
while I fight to protect
my people and the human girl

00:36.182 --> 00:38.526
who saved my life... at any cost.

00:38.576 --> 00:40.718
Previously on Star-Crossed...

00:40.720 --> 00:42.226
We're the new Red Hawks.

00:42.228 --> 00:45.638
There are Atrian terrorists
known as the Trags.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.518
And they're planning a
strike against humans.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.022
When my mom returned to the
Sector, Vega wanted her

00:51.024 --> 00:53.695
to build something called
the Suvek for the Trags.

00:53.697 --> 00:56.573
Suvek. That means blast or flash.

00:56.575 --> 00:58.276
You think it's some kind of bomb?

00:58.278 --> 00:59.980
Trags might have started building it,

00:59.982 --> 01:02.857
but it's up to us to make
sure they don't finish.

01:02.859 --> 01:04.992
I make it harder for you
to protect your people.

01:04.995 --> 01:07.229
They're never going to fully trust you,

01:07.231 --> 01:08.632
as long as you're with me.

01:08.634 --> 01:09.871
What are you saying?

01:09.873 --> 01:12.078
That maybe we shouldn't be together.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.045 --> 01:46.314
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.283
Hi.

01:48.285 --> 01:50.353
Hey.

01:50.355 --> 01:52.722
Uh...

01:52.724 --> 01:55.898
Every year, students come
up with elaborate ways

01:55.900 --> 01:58.670
to ask each other to
the Winter Blast dance.

01:58.672 --> 02:01.107
Well, that explains why
I saw Frosty the Snowman

02:01.109 --> 02:03.144
at the urinal practicing his Shakespeare.

02:03.146 --> 02:06.251
You guys think our traditions are bizarre?

02:08.019 --> 02:09.485
How's the Sector?

02:09.488 --> 02:11.522
How are you? Are you safe?

02:11.524 --> 02:13.359
You don't really have to
worry about me anymore.

02:13.361 --> 02:16.129
Your Uncle Castor is a homicidal maniac,

02:16.131 --> 02:17.665
your terrorist ex-girlfriend

02:17.667 --> 02:20.067
drugged you, so... yeah, I worry.

02:20.069 --> 02:21.735
Emery...

02:21.737 --> 02:25.409
You're the one that said
we'd be better off apart.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.217
Have fun at the dance.

02:33.858 --> 02:36.059
Took you ten years to reconnect with him,

02:36.061 --> 02:39.299
and, like, ten seconds for you to dump him.

02:39.301 --> 02:40.735
If we were together,

02:40.737 --> 02:42.638
his people would question his loyalties.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.708
It's hard to compete with
the future of an entire race.

02:45.710 --> 02:47.143
Look, I know you're bummed,

02:47.145 --> 02:49.214
but you need a Roman holiday.

02:49.216 --> 02:51.617
And the Winter Blast is our
first high school dance ever.

02:51.619 --> 02:52.818
I don't have a date.

02:52.820 --> 02:54.454
Em, I need you there.

02:54.456 --> 02:57.093
Every year, they pick one new
student to sing at the dance,

02:57.095 --> 02:58.628
and Taylor tapped me.

02:58.630 --> 03:00.231
Me. If I go sharp,

03:00.233 --> 03:02.434
she'll melt me with one cold hard stare.

03:02.436 --> 03:04.338
Please say you'll come.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.841
Going solo is very "now."

03:06.843 --> 03:08.642
Says the girl with the date.

03:08.644 --> 03:10.912
Not yet, I don't.

03:12.248 --> 03:15.214
But that could change very soon.

03:15.216 --> 03:16.515
Hey.

03:16.517 --> 03:18.419
Uh, you want to go to the dance, right?

03:18.421 --> 03:20.051
Um, yeah.

03:20.053 --> 03:22.184
Cool.

03:23.922 --> 03:26.155
Direct, straight to the point.

03:26.157 --> 03:27.422
I like it.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.153
Yeah. He's a no-frills kind of guy.

03:37.495 --> 03:40.526
You've been freezing me
out since the hurricane.

03:40.528 --> 03:42.360
Oh, you mean the one you created

03:42.362 --> 03:43.696
so that you could smuggle equipment

03:43.698 --> 03:46.532
into the Sector for the Trags?

03:46.534 --> 03:49.267
You really think if you drugged
me, I wouldn't figure it out?

03:49.269 --> 03:50.903
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

03:50.905 --> 03:53.206
Save it, Teri. You really
want to earn my trust,

03:53.208 --> 03:55.473
you'll tell me what you
and the Trags are building.

03:56.806 --> 03:58.406
Yeah, that's what I thought.

03:58.408 --> 04:01.178
You might want to think
twice before pushing me away.

04:01.180 --> 04:04.178
You need all the friends
you can get right now.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.286
Teri say anything about the Suvek?

04:09.288 --> 04:11.122
No.

04:11.124 --> 04:13.189
Vega won't start a war she can't win.

04:13.191 --> 04:15.291
And I'm worried my mom
might be helping her.

04:15.293 --> 04:17.461
I thought you said she
refused to build the Suvek.

04:17.463 --> 04:19.262
She did. But she's been acting strange.

04:19.264 --> 04:21.630
Past few nights staying out till curfew.

04:21.632 --> 04:23.999
Said she's getting
reacquainted with the Sector.

04:24.001 --> 04:27.002
Can I still count on her to
back me up with the Hwatab?

04:27.004 --> 04:28.271
She's our only witness

04:28.273 --> 04:29.672
to Castor's role in crashing the ship.

04:29.674 --> 04:31.176
If I don't have her testimony, it's just

04:31.178 --> 04:32.776
- my words against his.
- Don't worry, all right?

04:32.778 --> 04:34.811
- She said she'd be there later.
- All right, good.

04:34.813 --> 04:37.314
If Castor remains Iksen, he's
going to stop integration,

04:37.316 --> 04:38.815
and we cannot allow that.

04:38.817 --> 04:40.517
I'll follow my mom after the meeting,

04:40.519 --> 04:42.750
find out where she's been going at night.

04:50.954 --> 04:52.320
Excuse me.

04:52.322 --> 04:54.554
I-I'll be right back.

05:04.098 --> 05:05.431
What?

05:05.433 --> 05:08.031
I brought you something from the Sector.

05:08.033 --> 05:10.331
It's called odyi.

05:10.333 --> 05:12.666
Striking, wild.

05:12.668 --> 05:16.170
It reminded me of you.

05:16.172 --> 05:17.972
In case you were wondering,

05:17.974 --> 05:20.911
this is kind of my way of
asking you to the Winter Blast.

05:22.814 --> 05:25.548
Oh, no. Are you allergic?

05:29.087 --> 05:31.286
Taylor, your eyes.

05:31.288 --> 05:32.787
What?

05:32.789 --> 05:35.624
Haven't you ever seen a girl cry before?

05:49.301 --> 05:51.936
Hey, I need to tell you something.

05:51.938 --> 05:54.036
I-I don't know who else I can trust.

05:54.038 --> 05:55.637
Uh...

05:55.639 --> 05:57.706
Yeah. What's wrong?

05:57.708 --> 05:59.975
It's about Taylor.

06:03.912 --> 06:06.615
Castor murdered our ship's captain.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.551
That's why we crashed.

06:08.553 --> 06:10.854
When I threatened to expose him, he tried

06:10.856 --> 06:12.521
to have me sent to the Crate.

06:12.523 --> 06:15.357
Roman, where is this
coming from? These lies?

06:15.359 --> 06:18.492
You know exactly where this is
coming from; you are a traitor.

06:20.529 --> 06:22.364
Where's Saroya?

06:22.366 --> 06:25.064
Roman is obviously
retaliating against me

06:25.066 --> 06:28.133
for exposing his relationship
with the human girl.

06:28.135 --> 06:32.167
Roman, you were six years old

06:32.169 --> 06:34.204
when our ship crashed on this planet.

06:34.206 --> 06:36.104
How could you possibly know what happened?

06:36.106 --> 06:38.037
I saw it for myself.

06:38.039 --> 06:39.571
Through the mirzan.

06:39.573 --> 06:42.506
And where is the flight recorder now?

06:42.508 --> 06:44.108
I tried to bring it to the council,

06:44.110 --> 06:45.676
but Castor got to me first.

06:47.310 --> 06:50.009
I barely escaped with my life.

06:50.011 --> 06:51.711
He's probably destroyed it by now.

06:51.713 --> 06:54.210
My nephew proves that he
cares more for the human girl

06:54.212 --> 06:55.443
than he does his own people.

06:55.445 --> 06:57.410
My relationship with Emery is over.

06:57.412 --> 07:00.044
I know you think I've
turned my back on my people,

07:00.046 --> 07:02.713
but Castor wants to end
the integration program.

07:02.715 --> 07:04.878
He wants to build his own sovereign nation.

07:04.880 --> 07:07.548
In a lot of ways, Castor
is even more dangerous

07:07.550 --> 07:09.383
than the Trags.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.917
He isn't afraid to kill one of his own.

07:13.552 --> 07:15.387
Not if we stand in his way.

07:15.389 --> 07:17.756
- You calling me a murderer?
- Roman, you do not have

07:17.758 --> 07:19.624
proof or a witness of any of this.

07:19.626 --> 07:21.826
Doesn't my word mean anything?

07:21.828 --> 07:23.895
As Nox's son?

07:23.897 --> 07:26.966
We want to trust you.

07:26.968 --> 07:29.303
But you deceived us all
about your relationship

07:29.305 --> 07:30.705
with the human girl.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.077
With that said,

07:38.079 --> 07:39.813
these are serious allegations,

07:39.815 --> 07:42.614
and we will be making inquiries.

07:44.349 --> 07:47.182
Castor shall remain Iksen.

07:47.184 --> 07:48.816
For now.

07:50.651 --> 07:52.882
Asoluviv.

07:59.256 --> 08:01.588
Our goal isn't

08:01.590 --> 08:03.955
to dismantle the Integration Program.

08:03.957 --> 08:05.623
We have one target:

08:05.625 --> 08:07.058
the Trags.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.658
Need to figure out what they're planning.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.960
We have an informant on
the inside... an Atrian...

08:10.962 --> 08:12.428
who can help us.

08:12.430 --> 08:14.862
But for right now, I need
you all to be patient.

08:20.836 --> 08:24.004
You call these runts Red Hawks?

08:24.006 --> 08:26.307
What are you doing here, Vartan?

08:26.309 --> 08:30.742
Think my invitation got lost in the mail.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.845
You know I'm the captain round these parts.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.347
Things are changing.

08:34.349 --> 08:37.049
Like the New Red Hawks...
we don't have captains

08:37.051 --> 08:38.450
or threaten Atrians

08:38.452 --> 08:41.188
or try to turn people against them.

08:41.191 --> 08:42.890
Oh.

08:42.893 --> 08:45.626
It's a kinder, gentler Red Hawks.

08:45.628 --> 08:47.230
Ain't that sweet.

08:47.232 --> 08:50.198
We're not in danger from
all Atrians, just the Trags.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.336
And if we can neutralize them,

08:52.338 --> 08:54.672
we might be able to
actually save some lives.

08:54.674 --> 08:56.608
I'll tell you what we should do,

08:56.610 --> 08:59.779
is go after that little
race traitor Emery Whitehill.

08:59.781 --> 09:01.847
Leave Emery out of this.

09:01.849 --> 09:06.619
That girl was dating the
son of the Atrians' leader.

09:06.621 --> 09:09.056
Bet she had all kinds of access.

09:09.058 --> 09:10.357
I don't want you

09:10.359 --> 09:12.759
or anyone doing anything stupid.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.264
It undermines what I'm trying to do here.

09:15.314 --> 09:16.559
You hear me?

09:18.530 --> 09:20.965
Making a big mistake, boy.

10:07.584 --> 10:09.151
What are you doing here?

10:09.153 --> 10:10.520
I wondered what could be so important

10:10.522 --> 10:12.458
that you'd bail on Roman.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.829
You have to get out of
here now; it's not safe.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.464
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me

10:16.466 --> 10:18.066
what the hell's going on.

10:18.068 --> 10:20.267
You said you'd never help the Trags.

10:20.269 --> 10:21.568
How could you lie to me?

10:21.570 --> 10:23.737
I didn't have a choice, Drake.

10:23.739 --> 10:25.872
Vega agreed to protect us both from Castor

10:25.874 --> 10:27.341
if I helped her build the Suvek.

10:27.343 --> 10:29.344
You were in danger. What else could I do?

10:29.346 --> 10:30.980
As soon as you finish,

10:30.982 --> 10:33.683
Vega's not gonna have
any use for you anymore.

10:33.685 --> 10:35.285
What happens to you then, hmm?

10:35.287 --> 10:38.052
Drake, I don't expect you to understand.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.153
I need you to trust me.

10:41.056 --> 10:42.455
Go.

10:42.457 --> 10:44.024
Now.

10:50.199 --> 10:52.601
Hey. Um, can I talk to you for a sec?

10:52.603 --> 10:55.804
It's... kind of sensitive.

10:57.672 --> 11:00.341
I think I know what this is about.

11:00.343 --> 11:02.343
Y-You do?

11:02.345 --> 11:05.044
Look, I was vulnerable, and she's hot.

11:05.094 --> 11:06.924
So, yes, I kissed Sophia.

11:06.974 --> 11:08.516
Let's not pretend that
you haven't been there.

11:08.566 --> 11:10.938
All those long, lonely
nights sharing a hospital room

11:10.988 --> 11:12.315
with Julia.

11:12.317 --> 11:15.150
No, no. This is about Drake.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.784
Ah. What about him?

11:16.786 --> 11:18.719
Well, I heard I'm not the only one

11:18.721 --> 11:20.553
going through an Atrian breakup.

11:20.555 --> 11:24.171
Uh, well, onward and upward, right?

11:24.221 --> 11:26.178
Sophia told me when she saw you

11:26.228 --> 11:28.189
earlier in the car...

11:28.191 --> 11:30.791
that your tears, they were, um...

11:30.793 --> 11:32.695
They were glowing.

11:32.697 --> 11:34.663
Glowing?

11:34.665 --> 11:36.328
Oh, my God.

11:36.330 --> 11:39.042
Did I catch some sort of Atrian STD?

11:39.092 --> 11:41.500
It's more of a temporary condition.

11:41.502 --> 11:44.004
When an Atrian woman's tears glow,

11:44.006 --> 11:47.274
it means they're... expecting.

11:47.276 --> 11:49.977
Expecting what?

11:49.979 --> 11:53.717
Taylor, you're... pregnant.

11:59.090 --> 12:01.894
My mom is helping
Vega build the Suvek.

12:01.896 --> 12:03.630
It's not finished yet.

12:03.632 --> 12:06.066
Well, at least that
buys us some time

12:06.068 --> 12:07.867
to figure out a way to stop her.

12:07.869 --> 12:10.603
While the Hwatab do
their digging into Castor.

12:10.605 --> 12:13.041
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

12:28.992 --> 12:30.925
Move! Move!

13:00.231 --> 13:03.600
Oh, my God. Is that what's
gonna happen to me?

13:03.602 --> 13:06.301
You need to stop
looking at these bogus sites.

13:06.303 --> 13:08.303
Just stay calm and...

13:08.305 --> 13:11.640
Who else knows that I'm carrying
a mutant baby in my stomach?

13:11.642 --> 13:13.975
Just you and me and Sophia.

13:13.977 --> 13:15.778
We need to keep it that way.

13:15.780 --> 13:17.914
If the Red Hawks find out,
they'll parade you around

13:17.916 --> 13:20.516
as their race-mixing poster child.

13:20.518 --> 13:22.586
I didn't know what to get,

13:22.588 --> 13:24.622
so I hope you're in
the mood for everything.

13:24.624 --> 13:26.956
Oh, thank God. I am starving.

13:26.958 --> 13:29.492
Atrian pregnancies are
a lot like human ones.

13:29.494 --> 13:31.430
But there are some differences.

13:31.432 --> 13:33.134
Like being constantly thirsty.

13:33.136 --> 13:36.370
Atrian women have to drink
two gallons of water a day

13:36.372 --> 13:37.804
just to keep hydrated.

13:37.806 --> 13:40.207
Since when did the Bug's food get so salty?

13:40.209 --> 13:43.679
Atrians are extra sensitive to salt, right?

13:43.681 --> 13:45.012
Oh, my God.

13:45.014 --> 13:47.513
Am I turning into an Atrian?

13:47.515 --> 13:48.979
No, no.

13:48.981 --> 13:50.347
You're probably just...

13:50.349 --> 13:53.317
expressing Atrian traits
to protect your baby.

13:53.319 --> 13:56.252
Can we stop talking about this
thing like it already exists?

13:56.254 --> 13:57.986
- No, no, no, no, no.
- You can't cry.

13:57.988 --> 13:59.021
You can't cry again. You can't cry again.

14:01.393 --> 14:04.026
It's almost complete.

14:05.827 --> 14:08.331
And then what happens?

14:08.333 --> 14:10.802
One day, you will learn patience.

14:10.804 --> 14:12.868
I was the one who smuggled in the equipment

14:12.870 --> 14:14.503
to build this thing.

14:14.505 --> 14:17.239
Or is starting a hurricane
not enough to earn your trust?

14:17.241 --> 14:19.175
Don't question my judgment.

14:19.177 --> 14:21.610
We each have a role to play.

14:22.679 --> 14:25.183
Your job isn't finished yet.

14:25.185 --> 14:26.917
It's called the Iksen's Key.

14:26.919 --> 14:29.517
We need it to operate the Suvek.

14:29.519 --> 14:31.222
Where is it?

14:31.224 --> 14:33.691
It's passed from Iksen to Iksen.

14:33.693 --> 14:36.557
I want you to find where Castor keeps it

14:36.559 --> 14:38.290
and bring the key to me.

14:38.292 --> 14:40.959
Am I your daughter or your errand girl now?

14:40.961 --> 14:42.426
You are a soldier.

14:42.428 --> 14:45.130
And a soldier does what they are told.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.171
Hey. Is, um... is Taylor all right?

14:52.173 --> 14:53.806
She keeps sending food back.

14:53.808 --> 14:55.778
Uh, you know Taylor.

14:55.780 --> 14:57.682
She's a picky eater.

14:57.684 --> 14:59.615
Right. Julia told me

14:59.617 --> 15:01.318
that you weren't going to the Winter Blast,

15:01.320 --> 15:02.921
and I cannot let that happen, so...

15:02.923 --> 15:04.490
- Lukas...
- I'm not taking no

15:04.492 --> 15:06.760
for an answer; and
besides, no one appreciates

15:06.762 --> 15:09.664
my smooth moves like you.

15:09.666 --> 15:12.237
- Appreciates? Or tolerates?
- Oh.

15:12.239 --> 15:15.072
Okay, see? You just
wish you had all of this.

15:15.074 --> 15:17.242
Oh. Oh.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.448
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey.

15:22.450 --> 15:23.983
Have you seen Grayson?

15:23.985 --> 15:26.087
He hasn't been at school all week.

15:26.089 --> 15:27.589
We don't really talk anymore.

15:27.591 --> 15:29.058
You don't?

15:29.060 --> 15:32.295
Grayson started back up
with the Red Hawks again.

15:32.297 --> 15:34.598
- How is that even possible?
- He's been using the school

15:34.600 --> 15:35.563
to recruit guys.

15:35.565 --> 15:36.629
Look, do me a favor.

15:36.631 --> 15:37.962
Don't get me involved, okay?

15:37.964 --> 15:40.932
I don't want anything to do with them.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.352
Drake.

15:53.354 --> 15:55.756
What happened to Roman?

15:55.758 --> 15:57.425
Is that blood on his shirt?

15:57.427 --> 15:59.058
Look, I don't want to get
in the middle of you two.

15:59.060 --> 16:00.259
You should talk to him yourself.

16:00.261 --> 16:01.594
I've tried talking to him.

16:01.596 --> 16:03.262
He won't tell me what's going on.

16:03.264 --> 16:06.468
Hey. Taylor really wants
to leave, like, now.

16:07.402 --> 16:10.602
Okay. I'll meet you outside.

16:10.604 --> 16:13.371
Uh, is everything all right
with your friend Taylor?

16:13.373 --> 16:16.041
Yeah. She's fine.

17:14.582 --> 17:17.117
Teri, what are you doing here?

17:18.420 --> 17:20.320
Leave us.

17:25.992 --> 17:27.859
I should send you to the Hwatab

17:27.862 --> 17:29.992
for breaking into your Iksen's pod.

17:29.994 --> 17:31.626
Let me guess:

17:31.628 --> 17:33.795
Vega sent you to poison me.

17:34.765 --> 17:37.334
You know, for a man of the people,

17:37.336 --> 17:39.000
you sure do have a lot of shiny things.

17:39.002 --> 17:40.434
Careful.

17:40.436 --> 17:42.670
That is a gift from one of my consorts.

17:42.672 --> 17:44.941
You're already on their bad side.

17:46.913 --> 17:48.847
Your mother...

17:48.849 --> 17:52.181
she treats you like any
other Trag, doesn't she?

17:53.718 --> 17:56.389
I can offer you a place here.

17:56.391 --> 17:58.457
In my employ.

17:58.459 --> 18:00.394
You're not serious.

18:00.396 --> 18:02.832
Vega is wasting your talent.

18:02.834 --> 18:05.266
I wouldn't make the same mistake.

18:07.566 --> 18:09.464
You're free to go.

18:11.766 --> 18:13.299
Think about it.

18:16.067 --> 18:19.136
So, your uncle's trying to
kill you while Vega's aiming

18:19.138 --> 18:21.473
to annihilate every human we know.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.906
Who should we try to take out first?

18:25.476 --> 18:27.378
We go after both.

18:27.380 --> 18:29.044
Both?

18:29.046 --> 18:30.778
Are you crazy?

18:30.780 --> 18:33.618
The grenade that almost killed
me was the same kind of grenade

18:33.620 --> 18:35.653
Castor gave us to destroy black cyper.

18:35.655 --> 18:38.256
He's got to have a whole
stash of them somewhere.

18:38.258 --> 18:39.926
If we could find the stash,

18:39.928 --> 18:41.860
we could use it to blow up the Suvek

18:41.862 --> 18:43.760
and set up Castor to take the blame.

18:43.762 --> 18:46.263
Now, if the Hwatab finds
out that he has explosives,

18:46.265 --> 18:47.799
he'll be sent to the Crate.

18:47.801 --> 18:50.936
If Vega doesn't get to him first.

18:50.938 --> 18:52.702
We're gonna need the help

18:52.704 --> 18:55.266
of an Atrian that Castor trusts.

18:57.405 --> 18:58.840
Maia, please. You're my sister.

18:58.842 --> 19:00.778
I would never bring harm to your son.

19:00.780 --> 19:03.080
Castor, I've known you your
whole life and I love you.

19:03.082 --> 19:05.250
But I also know what
you're capable of doing.

19:05.252 --> 19:06.987
I won't hear this. Not from you.

19:06.989 --> 19:09.658
Wait, wait. I-I don't
mean to offend you.

19:09.660 --> 19:10.960
Please.

19:10.962 --> 19:13.230
I-I'm begging you, Castor.

19:13.232 --> 19:16.031
Roman's made mistakes,
but don't turn against him.

19:16.033 --> 19:17.965
Help him find his way.

19:17.967 --> 19:19.732
He looks to you like a father.

19:21.836 --> 19:24.137
How long do you think
your mom can hold him?

19:24.139 --> 19:26.439
I don't know. We got to move fast.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.515
The fan.

19:36.554 --> 19:38.589
- Hey.
- Yeah.

19:38.591 --> 19:41.156
This doesn't look like
it's attached to anything.

19:44.458 --> 19:47.227
Whoa.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.126
It's enough explosives in here to blow up

19:49.128 --> 19:50.226
the whole Sector.

19:50.228 --> 19:52.831
Only take a few.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.988
Still don't get why we
have to go to the dance.

20:20.990 --> 20:23.743
It's our cover. By the time Vega discovers

20:23.793 --> 20:25.031
her Suvek has been destroyed

20:25.081 --> 20:28.097
and the Trags are hunting down
Castor, we'll be miles away.

20:28.147 --> 20:30.746
What's to stop Vega from
building another Suvek?

20:30.796 --> 20:32.397
Well, she had to start a hurricane

20:32.399 --> 20:33.966
to get the parts to build this one.

20:33.968 --> 20:35.769
It'll take her months to try again.

20:35.771 --> 20:37.604
Buys us time to dismantle
the Trags completely.

20:37.606 --> 20:39.337
Yeah, but none of this is gonna work

20:39.339 --> 20:40.671
if Castor takes you out first.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.108
So let's get moving.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.377
Are you sure you should be doing this?

20:46.379 --> 20:47.877
Because of my condition?

20:47.879 --> 20:49.911
I have been pregnant

20:49.913 --> 20:53.210
for two minutes, and it's
already cramping my flair.

20:54.446 --> 20:56.547
Are you gonna tell Drake?

20:56.549 --> 20:58.683
I don't know. I'm still
trying to wrap my head

20:58.685 --> 21:00.785
around this whole situation.

21:00.787 --> 21:02.454
You know what pisses me off the most?

21:02.504 --> 21:04.654
I mean, besides having a half-alien baby

21:04.656 --> 21:08.455
that might kill me... or
worse, give me cankles?

21:09.759 --> 21:12.862
I really like Drake.

21:16.868 --> 21:19.102
At least, on the bright side,

21:19.104 --> 21:23.911
sex with an Atrian is
pretty amazing, right?

21:26.350 --> 21:30.021
Roman and I... we never...

21:30.023 --> 21:32.493
No. Seriously?

21:32.495 --> 21:36.131
What were you guys doing in the
storage closet that whole time?

21:36.133 --> 21:38.998
We just wanted to be together.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.398
Oh.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.800
We still do.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.804
But you should know,

21:46.806 --> 21:49.773
before you ran off at the
Bug, Drake asked about you.

21:49.775 --> 21:52.909
Really? He did?

21:52.911 --> 21:53.944
Yeah.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.680
Maybe he still thinks about you

21:55.682 --> 21:57.551
the way that you think about him.

22:00.454 --> 22:03.391
Do you think our exes are
gonna be at the dance tonight?

22:03.393 --> 22:06.329
Maybe.

22:06.331 --> 22:10.200
But if Drake's there,
you should talk to him.

22:11.902 --> 22:15.001
Vega's daughter breaks
in, and you let her go?

22:15.003 --> 22:16.971
I let Teri go because I can

22:16.973 --> 22:18.372
see things that her mother can't.

22:18.374 --> 22:21.811
Her intelligence, her inner strength.

22:21.813 --> 22:24.812
Traits that the Trags
don't fully appreciate.

22:26.581 --> 22:29.849
If she was in our tribe,

22:29.851 --> 22:31.484
she wouldn't just be some lackey.

22:31.486 --> 22:33.085
She would be honored, respected.

22:33.087 --> 22:35.922
Maybe even lead our people one day.

22:39.527 --> 22:41.561
Emery.

22:41.563 --> 22:43.765
I've been wanting to talk to you.

22:43.767 --> 22:46.134
Eric said you're restarting the Red Hawks.

22:46.136 --> 22:48.936
It's not what you think, okay?

22:48.938 --> 22:51.675
We're not an Atrian hate group or anything.

22:51.677 --> 22:53.512
We're just trying to protect humans.

22:53.514 --> 22:55.679
Come to a meeting, I'll prove it to you.

22:55.681 --> 22:59.149
Okay, a Red Hawk meeting is the
last place you'll ever find me.

22:59.151 --> 23:01.016
We don't march around
chanting, "Tattie, go home."

23:01.018 --> 23:03.150
We're just trying to figure
out what the Trags are up to.

23:03.152 --> 23:04.986
Trags?

23:04.988 --> 23:07.188
Where did you hear that word?

23:07.190 --> 23:08.757
Emery, you know the Atrians.

23:08.759 --> 23:11.060
You can help us figure out
what the Trags are up to.

23:11.062 --> 23:14.197
I mean, that's all we want, I swear.

23:14.199 --> 23:17.099
Roman and I broke up, so if you're
trying to use me for information,

23:17.101 --> 23:18.332
you're wasting your time.

23:18.334 --> 23:20.167
You broke up?

23:20.169 --> 23:22.770
I'll see you around.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.522
I'll be right there.

24:01.941 --> 24:05.342
So, what was so important that
you needed to see me right away?

24:05.344 --> 24:07.677
Emery Whitehill's pregnant...

24:07.679 --> 24:10.044
with an Atrian baby.

24:10.046 --> 24:12.246
No.

24:12.248 --> 24:14.817
Everybody knows she's been
carrying on with that Tattie.

24:14.819 --> 24:19.490
Now she's researching
human-Atrian pregnancies.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.090
Well, you're wrong.

24:21.092 --> 24:23.023
She's not even with Roman anymore.

24:23.025 --> 24:25.628
She is pulling the wool
over your eyes, boy.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.563
Don't you get it?

24:27.565 --> 24:29.365
Race-mixing is how it starts.

24:29.367 --> 24:33.569
They use our women to
breed, populate our planet.

24:33.571 --> 24:35.438
Then they infiltrate our government

24:35.440 --> 24:37.408
and use our weapons against us.

24:37.410 --> 24:40.082
They are here to colonize.

24:40.084 --> 24:41.683
And this is the proof

24:41.685 --> 24:43.885
we need to make people see.

24:45.687 --> 24:47.521
For the last time,

24:47.523 --> 24:50.359
stay away from Emery.

24:50.361 --> 24:52.695
I'm not gonna tell you again.

25:08.109 --> 25:11.310
I believe you have
something that belongs to me.

25:19.051 --> 25:22.343
You know you can't steal
from me and get away with it.

25:22.393 --> 25:24.578
You're the only one in the Sector who knew

25:24.628 --> 25:25.787
I had those explosives.

25:25.837 --> 25:27.238
Thought they looked familiar

25:27.240 --> 25:28.879
when your assassin
tried to plant one on me.

25:28.929 --> 25:31.545
Well, you're not brazen
enough to take me out.

25:31.547 --> 25:33.845
What, were you gonna
bring them to the Hwatab?

25:33.847 --> 25:36.282
You think that they can
make everything right?

25:36.284 --> 25:38.753
You're just like your father.

25:38.755 --> 25:41.422
Full of naive optimism.

25:41.424 --> 25:43.190
Look where that got him.

25:43.192 --> 25:45.924
If you're not careful,
you could end up dead, too.

25:45.926 --> 25:48.023
Uncle.

25:48.025 --> 25:49.924
I am your Iksen.

25:49.926 --> 25:52.093
You took my grenades.

25:52.095 --> 25:53.995
I want them back.

26:57.940 --> 26:59.409
You made it!

26:59.411 --> 27:01.079
Of course.

27:01.081 --> 27:02.813
We wouldn't miss your big debut.

27:02.815 --> 27:05.649
Oh, hey, this music is
hurting my face, so excuse me

27:05.651 --> 27:08.222
while I have a little
come-to-Jesus talk with the DJ.

27:10.627 --> 27:11.993
Oh.

27:11.995 --> 27:13.997
I'll be out back. Break a leg.

27:13.999 --> 27:16.100
- Where are you going?
- Oh, my buddies and I

27:16.102 --> 27:18.237
always spend the dance outside
drinking by the bleachers.

27:18.239 --> 27:21.207
Okay. But you'll miss my song.

27:21.209 --> 27:22.876
I've heard you practice,
like, a million times.

27:22.878 --> 27:25.111
You're gonna be great. Meet up later.

27:27.047 --> 27:28.715
Are you okay?

27:28.717 --> 27:32.055
Is this how I pictured my
first high school dance?

27:32.057 --> 27:33.390
No.

27:33.392 --> 27:35.760
I wanted my date and I to bust in on an ATV

27:35.762 --> 27:38.199
and slay the crowd with
our righteous dance moves.

27:38.201 --> 27:41.269
But we don't always
get what we want, do we?

27:41.271 --> 27:44.073
Sometimes we get lukewarm punch.

27:45.807 --> 27:48.671
Well, here's to lukewarm punch.

27:48.673 --> 27:50.307
May it forever be spiked.

27:50.309 --> 27:51.310
Mm-hmm.

27:51.312 --> 27:53.981
Well... wish me luck.

27:53.983 --> 27:55.448
I have to go warm up.

27:55.450 --> 27:58.152
Good luck.

28:03.260 --> 28:04.993
Hi.

28:04.995 --> 28:06.863
Um...

28:06.865 --> 28:09.200
I owe you an apology.

28:09.202 --> 28:11.601
You asked me to the dance,

28:11.603 --> 28:13.538
and I never actually answered you.

28:13.540 --> 28:15.807
I'm just happy I could be there for you.

28:15.809 --> 28:17.209
Why?

28:17.211 --> 28:19.577
I mean...

28:19.579 --> 28:21.950
why are you so nice to me?

28:21.952 --> 28:25.317
I'm a knocked-up mess
who can't get over her ex.

28:25.319 --> 28:27.586
We're still friends,

28:27.588 --> 28:31.358
and... you're a knockout,
even if you are knocked-up.

28:32.461 --> 28:34.196
I'll probably be less nice to you

28:34.198 --> 28:36.364
once you start ballooning out.

28:45.210 --> 28:47.981
Emery? I need to ask you something.

28:48.848 --> 28:50.582
Are you pregnant?

28:50.584 --> 28:53.051
What?

28:53.053 --> 28:54.553
Where did you hear that?

28:54.555 --> 28:56.121
- Vartan told me...
- Vartan?

28:56.123 --> 28:58.171
He's part of your new
and improved Red Hawks?

28:58.221 --> 28:59.848
No, he isn't part of
what we're trying to do.

28:59.898 --> 29:01.415
Would you... You still
haven't answered my question.

29:01.465 --> 29:02.996
Not that it's any of your business,

29:03.046 --> 29:05.397
but, no, I'm not pregnant.

29:05.399 --> 29:07.180
And if you're trying to convince me

29:07.230 --> 29:09.403
that your club is any different,

29:09.405 --> 29:11.592
going around asking if I'm knocked up

29:11.642 --> 29:13.744
isn't exactly helping your cause.

29:15.914 --> 29:17.701
Have you seen Taylor?

29:17.751 --> 29:19.421
We need to keep her out of the spotlight.

29:19.471 --> 29:20.785
I think the Red Hawks may be on to her.

29:20.787 --> 29:22.086
Hello,

29:22.088 --> 29:23.854
Marshall!

29:25.793 --> 29:27.458
Too late.

29:27.460 --> 29:29.895
I'm Taylor Beecham, but
you already knew that.

29:29.897 --> 29:35.001
Now, who is here to get winter blasted?!

29:41.539 --> 29:44.074
Castor.

29:44.076 --> 29:46.178
Castor didn't do this.

29:46.180 --> 29:48.649
Castor used the same kind of grenade

29:48.651 --> 29:50.616
on Roman in the market yesterday.

29:50.618 --> 29:53.786
And he was seen outside our
garden after the explosion.

29:53.788 --> 29:55.356
If not Castor, then who?

29:55.358 --> 29:58.925
Not only did you fail to
bring me the Iksen's Key,

29:58.927 --> 30:00.561
but you let this happen.

30:00.563 --> 30:02.329
Our most sacred place destroyed

30:02.331 --> 30:05.098
by the same person you were
supposed to be watching.

30:05.899 --> 30:07.800
Arm yourselves!

30:07.802 --> 30:10.769
Castor pays for what he has done.

30:10.771 --> 30:13.306
Tonight!

30:14.778 --> 30:16.245
Vega is gonna obliterate Castor

30:16.247 --> 30:19.181
when she finds out the
Suvek's been destroyed.

30:19.183 --> 30:21.918
She's not exactly subtle... or forgiving.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.221
Hey, it was either you or him.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.955
Let's try to enjoy ourselves tonight.

30:25.957 --> 30:29.460
Who knows? Maybe we'll even have some fun.

30:29.462 --> 30:31.428
You all know the tradition, right?

30:31.430 --> 30:33.495
Every year, we have...

30:37.431 --> 30:41.132
a song sung by one of our new students.

30:41.134 --> 30:45.105
And it is my pleasure to introduce

30:45.107 --> 30:47.273

32:22.478 --> 32:24.482
You make a move,

32:24.484 --> 32:27.650
I'll slice you open right here.

32:35.724 --> 32:36.986
What are you talking about?

32:37.036 --> 32:39.045
You're an abomination before God.

32:39.047 --> 32:42.215
You being with that alien
boy... it's unnatural.

32:42.217 --> 32:44.557
I am not pregnant.

32:44.607 --> 32:46.724
Yeah, well, I got me a doctor lined up.

32:46.774 --> 32:49.017
We'll see what he says.

32:49.019 --> 32:51.052
- You're making a mistake.
- Shut up.

32:51.054 --> 32:53.362
Doctor can run his test and then he'll see

32:53.412 --> 32:54.521
and you and Grayson will see...

32:54.571 --> 32:56.622
Grayson? He ain't got the stones.

32:56.624 --> 32:58.857
He had his way, the Red
Hawks and the Atrians

32:58.858 --> 33:01.159
would be holding hands, singing "Kumbaya."

33:01.209 --> 33:04.664
But I ain't gonna let that happen.

33:06.034 --> 33:07.201
I warned you!

33:08.302 --> 33:09.969
You okay?

33:15.475 --> 33:17.407
Leave him alone!

33:17.409 --> 33:20.912
There's a war going on here, boy!

33:20.914 --> 33:23.249
It ain't gonna be won by no Boy Scouts.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.551
Get off him! Hey, hey, hey! Get off him!

33:25.553 --> 33:26.585
Who the hell...?!

33:26.587 --> 33:28.289
Get off him! Leave him alone!

33:28.291 --> 33:30.794
Meet my Boy Scouts.

33:35.068 --> 33:37.039
You okay?

33:38.377 --> 33:40.344
So, what made you come back to the dance?

33:40.346 --> 33:43.281
I was drinking with my buddies,
making fun of all the losers

33:43.283 --> 33:45.352
in here, and I realized...

33:45.354 --> 33:47.554
I'd rather be a loser inside with you.

33:55.695 --> 34:01.001
Wish we knew what was
going on inside the Sector.

34:01.003 --> 34:02.270
Relax.

34:05.209 --> 34:08.578
Um... I need to talk to you.

34:09.446 --> 34:11.812
I'm gonna grab a drink.

34:11.813 --> 34:13.347
I'm sorry. I-I can't.

34:13.349 --> 34:15.917
I'm pregnant.

34:19.052 --> 34:22.188
I don't need anything from you.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.824
I just figured you deserve to know.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.297
And now you do.

34:29.299 --> 34:31.199
So I'm done.

34:31.201 --> 34:32.368
No, wait.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.273
No, it hasn't been easy,

34:34.275 --> 34:37.938
you know, getting over you.

34:37.940 --> 34:39.938
But this...

34:39.940 --> 34:42.042
it definitely helps.

34:53.618 --> 34:56.424
I'm sorry about Vartan.

34:56.426 --> 34:59.860
I saw his car in the parking
lot and knew something was up.

34:59.862 --> 35:02.297
You okay?

35:02.299 --> 35:04.769
I'll be fine.

35:04.771 --> 35:06.568
Don't worry.

35:06.570 --> 35:09.171
He's not gonna be bothering
you or anyone for a long time.

35:09.173 --> 35:14.114
What he did had nothing to do
with me or my New Red Hawks.

35:14.116 --> 35:16.181
I hope you believe that.

35:16.183 --> 35:18.818
I do.

35:18.820 --> 35:21.155
You want me to take you home?

35:25.094 --> 35:28.599
I don't think I'm ready to
give up on this night yet.

35:30.136 --> 35:32.373
Do you want to dance?

36:17.711 --> 36:18.977
Come with me.

36:20.715 --> 36:22.883
Now!

36:37.043 --> 36:38.677
It's gonna be all right.

36:38.679 --> 36:40.680
Taylor's pregnant. How
is anything all right?

36:40.682 --> 36:41.947
In one day,

36:41.949 --> 36:43.849
we raided Castor's weapons bunker,

36:43.851 --> 36:46.197
turned Vega against him
and destroyed the Suvek.

36:46.247 --> 36:47.382
You can handle this.

36:47.432 --> 36:49.155
We don't even know if our plan worked.

36:49.157 --> 36:52.558
Well, we'll know soon enough,
once we get back to the Sector.

36:52.560 --> 36:55.296
Right now, I think you
need to go find Taylor.

36:55.298 --> 36:57.065
What's the point?

36:57.067 --> 36:59.768
You know better than anyone
it's not gonna work out.

37:01.271 --> 37:03.037
Being with Emery wasn't easy,

37:03.039 --> 37:05.171
but I don't regret it for a second.

37:05.173 --> 37:09.507
So stop being a hardheaded
Vwasak and go find your girl.

37:14.114 --> 37:16.281
So, your New Red Hawks...

37:16.283 --> 37:18.316
you're really not about hating Atrians

37:18.318 --> 37:19.817
or fighting integration?

37:19.819 --> 37:22.621
All we care about is going
after terrorist Atrians,

37:22.623 --> 37:25.555
like the ones who want
to hurt humans. That's it.

37:25.557 --> 37:27.925
When you think about it,
we're on the same side.

37:34.729 --> 37:38.163
I just want the Atrians to be free.

37:38.165 --> 37:41.432
Free to do whatever they want,

37:41.434 --> 37:44.570
free to be with whomever they want.

37:44.572 --> 37:48.274
If that's the future you're fighting for...

37:48.276 --> 37:51.011
then I'm willing to help.

37:54.850 --> 37:56.851
I don't want to talk to you.

37:56.853 --> 37:58.253
Don't. No, no. Don't...

37:58.255 --> 38:00.355
No. No. I'm not letting you go.

38:00.357 --> 38:02.157
Listen,

38:02.159 --> 38:05.795
I had to break up with you
because of a bad situation.

38:07.631 --> 38:10.900
All I ever wanted was to be with you.

38:13.470 --> 38:17.473
It's not about us being
together or not anymore.

38:19.642 --> 38:21.308
What am I gonna do?

38:21.310 --> 38:23.543
I don't know, okay?

38:23.545 --> 38:26.783
Hey. But whatever happens, I'll be there.

38:26.785 --> 38:30.253
Until when?

38:30.255 --> 38:32.222
Curfew?

38:32.224 --> 38:35.059
When you have to go back to the Sector?

38:39.936 --> 38:42.569
Drake, I am on my own out here.

38:42.571 --> 38:43.836
No, you're not.

38:43.838 --> 38:45.505
Hey.

38:45.507 --> 38:48.443
I'm gonna figure this out, okay?

38:48.445 --> 38:51.012
If you let me.

38:53.382 --> 38:55.551
Okay.

39:02.999 --> 39:04.866
You've heard me say over and over

39:04.868 --> 39:08.237
that information is the most
powerful weapon in our arsenal,

39:08.239 --> 39:10.542
that it can keep our people safe.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.281
Someone has joined our cause
tonight, someone who can

39:14.283 --> 39:18.319
provide new and vital
information on the Atrians.

39:18.321 --> 39:20.692
For those of you who don't know me,

39:20.694 --> 39:23.528
I'm Emery Whitehill.

39:23.530 --> 39:26.599
And I'm here to help the New Red Hawks.

39:41.952 --> 39:44.286
I know it hurts, but you need it.

39:44.288 --> 39:46.223
It'll help extract the toxins.

39:46.225 --> 39:48.923
If Vega finds out about this...

39:48.925 --> 39:52.160
Let me worry about my mother.

39:52.162 --> 39:54.462
Why are you doing this?

39:58.734 --> 40:00.934
I'll get you some bandages.

40:19.488 --> 40:21.724
I told the Hwatab to search
Castor's hidden room

40:21.726 --> 40:22.927
like you said.

40:22.929 --> 40:24.761
Did they find his stash of grenades?

40:24.763 --> 40:26.562
They were shocked.

40:26.564 --> 40:29.934
They revoked Castor's
right to rule immediately.

40:29.936 --> 40:33.271
Mom, thank you.

40:33.273 --> 40:35.006
I know this wasn't easy.

40:35.008 --> 40:39.076
Castor stopped being my brother
as soon as he tried to harm you.

40:41.179 --> 40:42.813
What about Vega?

40:42.815 --> 40:44.814
Did you destroy the Suvek?

40:44.816 --> 40:46.315
Yes.

40:46.317 --> 40:47.917
It's taken care of.

40:49.254 --> 40:52.051
The Trags won't be hurting
anyone anytime soon.

40:59.522 --> 41:01.957
You did well.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.560
It was wise to build the
Suvek to survive attack.

41:04.562 --> 41:07.263
It withstood the blast beautifully.

41:07.265 --> 41:10.897
Using shell panels from the
ship to build it was your idea.

41:10.899 --> 41:13.166
I just did as I was told.

41:13.168 --> 41:16.238
Finish your work.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.809
In a few days...

41:18.811 --> 41:20.744
we introduce it to the world.
