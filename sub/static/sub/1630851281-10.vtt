WEBVTT

00:05.048 --> 00:08.008
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i> Your dad is
a hell of a guy.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.010
Maybe...you and I could
grab dinner sometime.

00:10.053 --> 00:10.923
That'd be great.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.490
Mm.
I bet your lovely wife

00:12.534 --> 00:14.362
is out there listening, too,
isn't she?

00:14.405 --> 00:15.493
I'm gonna
report your husband

00:15.537 --> 00:17.017
to the California
state bar.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.714
I'm gonna have
his law license revoked

00:18.757 --> 00:20.411
for betraying the trust
of a client.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.022
Oh, my God.
Are you going to propose?

00:22.065 --> 00:23.327
I'm in love with you.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.981
Thank God. 'Cause I'm
in love with you, too.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.765
- Bailey.
- Jason.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.245
I'm John Nolan, her boyfriend.
And you are?

00:28.289 --> 00:29.855
Uh, her husband.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.862
Uh, you mean ex-husband.

00:36.906 --> 00:39.126
Uh, I do not.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.693
Long time, babe. I guess
she didn't mention me, huh?

00:41.737 --> 00:43.782
I mean, I get it. You know,
it's -- it's embarrassing.

00:43.826 --> 00:46.655
A husband in prison.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.222
Bailey?

00:48.265 --> 00:49.745
You're weren't supposed to
get out for another two years.

00:49.788 --> 00:52.139
Good behavior. I-I can
hardly believe it myself.

00:52.182 --> 00:55.403
Oh. Look. Uh, clearly
I'm interrupting here.

00:55.446 --> 00:58.058
Um, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you were seeing someone.

00:58.101 --> 00:59.711
Uh, it's nice
to meet you, John.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.191
You, uh,
be good to her, huh?

01:01.235 --> 01:03.889
My wife deserves the best.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.195
It's good to see you.

01:06.675 --> 01:07.937
Sorry.

01:18.469 --> 01:19.862
So you're married.

01:22.734 --> 01:25.650
And you didn't tell me.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.304
I-I have to go.

01:27.348 --> 01:28.958
Bailey.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.135
Bailey.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.326
Smells great. Salmon?

01:49.370 --> 01:50.588
And eggs.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.851
I'm not really
a breakfast person.

01:52.895 --> 01:55.898
I know. It's for Kojo.
Excuse me.

01:55.941 --> 01:58.335
Salmon and eggs.
For your dog.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.555
Well, not <i>every</i> day.
I have to watch his cholesterol.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.167
Oh!

02:04.211 --> 02:05.821
There he is!
Who's a good dog?

02:05.864 --> 02:07.257
Who's the <i>best</i> dog?

02:07.301 --> 02:09.085
Tricia will be here at 11:00
to give you a walk.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.565
Ready to go?

02:11.827 --> 02:14.090
Whoa! Hey!
Kojo, knock it off.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.224
He's just a little territorial
around his food.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.964
- How long have you had him?
- A year.

02:19.008 --> 02:20.749
He was Lucy's,
but she couldn't keep him.

02:23.969 --> 02:26.189
Kojo! Unh-unh!

02:26.233 --> 02:28.583
<i>Armed stay. Exit now.</i>

02:30.193 --> 02:32.543
Kojo! Hey, hey, hey!

02:32.587 --> 02:34.066
I am -- I'm sorry.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.068
Look, it's your first time
sleeping over,

02:36.112 --> 02:38.070
and he's just not
used to you being here.

02:38.114 --> 02:41.073
Here. Why don't you
just put your hand out?

02:41.117 --> 02:43.685
It's okay.
The alarm is about to set.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.904
We can do it another day.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.471
Sure.

02:47.515 --> 02:50.518
Hey. Be good.
Alright?

02:52.084 --> 02:53.912
Why didn't Bailey
just tell me?

02:53.956 --> 02:57.089
I mean, if it's complicated,
just say so. I'll understand.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.440
Is it because of the ex-con
thing and I'm a cop?

02:59.483 --> 03:02.399
Who doesn't have a criminal
in their family?

03:02.443 --> 03:04.227
It does not get much more
embarrassing than Pete.
Mm.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.316
And I'm -- Oh, I'm spinning out.
I-I'm gonna stop.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.013
Well, of course
you're spinning out.

03:08.057 --> 03:09.928
I mean, she's been lying to you
this whole time.

03:09.972 --> 03:12.104
And technically I didn't ask
if she was married.

03:12.148 --> 03:14.150
Yeah, but she knows
you were serious about her.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.239
Every day that she did not
tell you about her husband

03:16.283 --> 03:18.415
is a day
that she lied to you.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.287
Do you know <i>
why</i> he was in jail?

03:20.330 --> 03:23.159
- No. No clue.
- Alright.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.249
Call my skip tracer,
have him run this Jason guy.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.120
You got a lot of questions.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.948
You need to start
getting answers.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.124
<i>Skip tracer Randy! That's</i> <i>
me! What can I do you for?</i>

03:32.168 --> 03:35.258
Whoa. Hey, Randy.
It's, uh, John Nolan.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.912
I need you
to run a name for me.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.609
When's Wesley gonna hear back
from the state bar?

03:38.653 --> 03:42.526
Ugh. Any day now. He hasn't
slept the last few nights.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.702
What happened?

03:44.746 --> 03:46.226
They suspended my license.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.749
I can't practice law
for six months.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.099
No. That's insane!

03:50.142 --> 03:51.318
You were under duress.

03:51.361 --> 03:52.580
They have to take that
into account.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.103
Can you appeal it?

03:54.146 --> 03:55.191
Look. It won't make
a difference.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.714
I broke client confidentiality.

03:56.758 --> 03:59.151
The state bar takes that
very seriously.

03:59.195 --> 04:01.284
I-It's not even about
the suspension itself.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.286
I'm on a list now of lawyers
who have embezzled

04:03.330 --> 04:04.853
from their clients,
taken bribes.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.029
For the rest of my career,
whenever somebody looks me up,

04:07.072 --> 04:08.987
they'll see that
I have been censured.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.206
I'm sorry.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.427
Yeah.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.822
Alright. Thanks.
I'll be in touch.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.433
What did his
parole officer say?

04:19.476 --> 04:21.826
Same thing --
he got out on good behavior.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.828
Unless he violates parole,
he's a free man.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.656
- And you don't believe it?
- Oh, I believe it.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.267
I'm sure he was charming,

04:27.310 --> 04:30.008
knew all the guards' birthdays,
asked after their kids,

04:30.052 --> 04:32.184
made everyone handcrafted gifts
at Christmas.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.795
Ah, he sounds...awful?

04:33.838 --> 04:35.623
It's all roses
and trips to Paris

04:35.666 --> 04:38.626
until you dare disagree
with him, and then...

04:38.669 --> 04:40.105
This is how it was.

04:40.149 --> 04:42.238
I would try and tell people
who he really was --

04:42.282 --> 04:45.894
they guy they never saw --
and I'd sound insane.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.765
Okay. Well, you know,
it's all behind you now.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.420
You got to focus on the future.
First up, get that divorce.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.683
I tried! For two years!

04:52.727 --> 04:54.119
He would go along with it,

04:54.163 --> 04:56.296
pretending to engage
in the negotiations,

04:56.339 --> 04:58.472
and then he'd cut off contact
for months.

04:58.515 --> 04:59.995
And just when I had given up,

05:00.038 --> 05:01.475
he would come back
with some new demand,

05:01.518 --> 05:03.477
and we would start this process
all over again.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.177
Fraud alert?

05:08.220 --> 05:12.573
Someone just charged $2,000
on my credit card.

05:12.616 --> 05:15.010
It's Jason.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.533
Or it's more likely
that some rando

05:16.577 --> 05:18.100
cloned your card,
don't you think?

05:18.143 --> 05:21.233
No. No. I-I-I-I-I don't --
I don't know. Maybe --

05:21.277 --> 05:24.236
Hey. Hey!
Do not spin out.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.283
You go into shock inside of
a burning building, people die.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.808
Right now your house
is a little on fire.

05:30.852 --> 05:33.376
So focus up.
What's your plan?

05:33.420 --> 05:37.293
Okay. Uh...call Jason
to the station.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.122
My turf, surrounded
by my friends.

05:40.165 --> 05:42.472
Show him that
I'm not afraid anymore.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.821
Tell him
I want a divorce.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.999
So, how's it going
with Ashley?

05:48.043 --> 05:50.828
Good. Although there was
some weirdness this morning.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.526
I don't think
she likes Kojo.

05:52.569 --> 05:53.875
So you broke up with her?

05:53.918 --> 05:55.746
That's -- That's too bad.
I liked her.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.792
Since when? Last time
we talked about her,

05:57.835 --> 05:59.184
you gave me grief
because she's a lifeguard.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.361
Okay. Look.
I've never really considered

06:01.404 --> 06:02.710
lifeguarding a career.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.102
Okay. You see,
and that is what's called

06:04.146 --> 06:05.495
"Baywatch"-based
implicit bias.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.323
- What?!
- Ashley went through

06:07.367 --> 06:09.717
rigorous training at the fire
academy to become a lifeguard.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.762
Okay. My bad. But you know what?
It is a moot point

06:11.806 --> 06:14.983
because she doesn't like Kojo,
first of his name,

06:15.026 --> 06:17.507
king of canines,
destroyer of chew toys.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.467
So, clearly,
Ashley has got to go.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.035
Check out
Mister Dollar Sign.

06:24.079 --> 06:27.212
Hand-to-hand transfer.
Classic 11532.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.695
Hey.
You are way too young

06:31.739 --> 06:33.349
to be throwing your life away
dealing drugs.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.046
Show me your hands.
Hey. No!

06:35.090 --> 06:36.700
Hey! Stop!
Control, 7-Adam-100.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.876
We got a foot pursuit
southbound, Citrus at Olympic.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.617
Black male. Green pants.
Black hoodie.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.358
Hey! Get back here!

06:43.533 --> 06:44.665
Put your hands
behind your head.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.318
Okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:49.104 --> 06:50.845
Control --

06:53.369 --> 06:55.066
What the hell?

06:55.110 --> 06:57.329
7-Adam-100. We've got
a possible Code 1000.

06:57.373 --> 06:58.766
Repeat -- Code 1000.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.332
Single-engine fixed wing
in distress, headed --

07:03.988 --> 07:05.773
Ohh. 7-Adam-15.

07:05.816 --> 07:09.820
A plane is down. 1200 block of
Langston. Send fire and RAs.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.695

Yeah.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.019
♪ Get away

07:35.063 --> 07:36.456
- Hey.
- Get me out of here, please.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.022
- Get me out of here.
- Just relax. Relax.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.546
Right now I just
need you to breathe.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.112
What's your name?
Jade.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.897
Okay, Jade.
Help is on the way, alright?

07:42.940 --> 07:44.986
Bailey, this is Jade.
Bailey's gonna help you out.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.205
She's one of the best.
Okay.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.946
We're gonna get you out of there
in no time, Jade.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.905
Tell me -- are you
- having trouble breathing?
- No.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.602
Did you hit your head
when you crashed?

07:52.646 --> 07:55.518
- I think so.
- Okay. Come on.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.006
What's the situation?

08:05.049 --> 08:06.616
We're still assessing.
The driver got the worst of it.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.009
The flipped cars were empty.

08:08.052 --> 08:10.054
- And the pilot?
- I don't know.

08:18.454 --> 08:21.849
There's no pilot.
Explains why it crashed.

08:24.678 --> 08:25.940
Control, this is Air 7.

08:25.983 --> 08:27.550
<i>We're on scene at that</i> <i>
fixed-wing code 1000.</i>

08:27.594 --> 08:30.858
<i>Requesting restricted air space</i> <i>
with half-a-mile perimeter.</i>

08:30.901 --> 08:32.076
Whoever was flying this plane
must've left prints.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.340
I will dust and run them
on my Mobile ID.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.219
Uh...guys?

08:44.262 --> 08:45.481
There's gold back here.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.092
Like a couple dozen
Fort Knox-size bars.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.226
And it gets weirder.

08:51.269 --> 08:54.055
The fingerprints I just pulled
match a Levi Lincoln,

08:54.098 --> 08:55.970
who is currently an inmate

08:56.013 --> 08:58.538
at the California
Correctional Facility.

08:58.581 --> 09:01.149
So an escaped convict
stole a plane

09:01.192 --> 09:02.759
and crashed it in the middle
of Mid-Wilshire?

09:02.803 --> 09:04.544
Don't forget
the 200 pounds of gold.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.197
I'll call the warden.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.722
Levi Lincoln? Why does
that name sound familiar?

09:08.765 --> 09:10.288
Oh, wait!

09:10.332 --> 09:13.596
Uh -- Uh, that millionaire
who killed his wife.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.859
Yeah, that narrows it down
less than you'd think.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.469
No. Uh, no.
I remember. Yeah.

09:17.513 --> 09:20.429
It was a particularly brutal
murder, but Levi's lawyer

09:20.472 --> 09:21.996
got the charges knocked down
to manslaughter.

09:22.039 --> 09:24.215
Yeah, looks like
he only got 10 years.

09:24.259 --> 09:25.565
This makes no sense.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.871
How does an inmate at
a maximum security prison

09:27.915 --> 09:30.352
break out with a plane
full of gold?

09:30.395 --> 09:33.311
He didn't. The prison says
Levi Lincoln's still there.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.618
Why are his prints
in the plane?

09:35.662 --> 09:36.967
Harper, Nolan,
go to the prison.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.186
Find out what the hell's
going on.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.709
Right.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.584
Uh, give me a minute?

09:44.627 --> 09:46.237
Yeah.

09:46.281 --> 09:49.763
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.591
I know
you're angry with me.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.854
Oh, I haven't really
gotten to angry yet.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.203
I think
I'm still in shock.

09:55.246 --> 09:57.074
I am so sorry.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.728
I -- It was
a nightmare marriage.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.948
I tried to divorce him,
but Jason fought me on it.

10:00.991 --> 10:03.385
Then he got arrested
and went to prison --
Bailey.

10:03.428 --> 10:06.127
I was so tired of fighting him
that I just walked away.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.347
Bailey, stop. I'm not angry
because you're married.

10:09.391 --> 10:13.308
I'm -- I mean, yes, I am.
Of course I am.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.963
I'm just more upset that
you didn't trust me enough

10:16.006 --> 10:18.008
to be honest about
something this important.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.227
Mnh.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.968
And I just don't...

10:21.011 --> 10:22.839
know how to move forward
from this.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.627
I got -- I got to go.

10:35.069 --> 10:37.375
You got to give him time.
I mean, he just found out.

10:37.419 --> 10:40.378
I know.
But I can't lose him over this.

10:40.422 --> 10:41.641
Bailey.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.949
Uh, thanks
for reaching out.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.690
Look, we are not
reconnecting here.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.300
I want a divorce.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.041
I get that you're pissed at me,
alright?

10:51.085 --> 10:52.956
And you -- you deserve to be.
But listen.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.263
Ever since I got out,
I-I've been trying to find you

10:55.306 --> 10:59.006
so that I could apologize
for the man that I was.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.747
And could I --
could I buy you lunch

11:00.790 --> 11:02.879
- and we could talk about it?
- No, Jason.

11:02.923 --> 11:05.577
We're talking here, because
this is where I feel safe.

11:05.621 --> 11:06.970
Of course. Yeah.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.494
Oh.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.627
Uh, I'm -- I'm Jason.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.196
Also known as the worst husband
in recorded history.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.677
- I'm Sharon.
- It's nice to meet you.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.375
So, what are you doing
here i-in L.A.?

11:20.418 --> 11:21.811
What do you want?

11:21.855 --> 11:25.249
For you to be happy.
Um...

11:27.208 --> 11:29.732
What's that?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.342
Divorce papers.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.649
I'm sorry.
I was so stubborn.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.738
I-I thought that I could
make you love me again.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.872
But I, uh, ruined
everything, didn't I?

11:41.222 --> 11:44.486
Anyway, uh, legally,
'cause I'm your spouse,

11:44.529 --> 11:46.488
I-I can't hand these
to you directly.

11:46.531 --> 11:49.578
So, uh, Sharon,
if you would be so kind.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.756
Um...
I'll see you around.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.935
Well, he's giving you
everything you want.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.898
Wes.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.727
James. Hey.
What are you doing here?

12:07.770 --> 12:10.904
Ugh. A kid I mentor
just got arrested.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.515
Hey, uh, maybe you
could represent him.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.258
Look, I-I wish I could,

12:17.301 --> 12:19.608
but my license just
got suspended for six months

12:19.651 --> 12:21.262
because of
the Elijah Stone thing.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.220
That's tough, man.
I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry.

12:23.264 --> 12:24.352
Thanks.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.528
So -- So what are you
gonna do?

12:26.571 --> 12:29.618
Well, right now I'm debating
which bar to get drunk at.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.446
Well, you should not
do that alone.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.622
Text me when you decide, and
I'll come meet you after this.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.102
Hm.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.800
Hey, I-I heard what happened.
I'm so sorry.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.410
I appreciate that.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.325
I'll text you.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.284
So, where's Tyler?

12:43.327 --> 12:45.242
Processing.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.983
I couldn't get ahold of
his mother, so when he said

12:47.027 --> 12:49.290
he knew you, I-I-I thought
it was worth a shot.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.335
Yeah. Tyler's in
a bad situation at home.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.468
His father's incarcerated,
and his mother...

12:53.511 --> 12:55.644
she has problems
of her own.

12:55.687 --> 12:56.819
So you caught him dealing?

12:56.863 --> 12:58.821
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.262
What the hell
was he thinking?

13:05.306 --> 13:07.134
You know, I have a little bit
of leeway here.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.223
I can cite him on a JCR,
which would mean

13:09.266 --> 13:12.269
he would go home today
until his court date.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.532
That would be huge.
I mean, I --

13:14.576 --> 13:16.186
I just started working
with this kid.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.362
He's -- He's veering
close to the edge,

13:18.406 --> 13:22.497
but if we lose him to the system
now, he's lost forever.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.456
Okay. Yeah.
I'll cite him out.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.372
I hate this prison.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.200
Are there prisons
you <i>don't</i> hate?

13:30.244 --> 13:32.420
All the ones
I haven't almost died in.

13:32.463 --> 13:34.552
At least we're not here
to see Oscar.
Why? Why?

13:34.596 --> 13:35.989
Why do you always jinx us?

13:36.032 --> 13:38.121
I-It's like a compulsion
with you.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.775
I --

13:39.819 --> 13:42.125
Levi Lincoln.
I am Detective Harper.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.824
This is Officer Nolan.
We have some questions for you.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.347
About what?

13:46.390 --> 13:50.351
Have you ever flown a Cessna,
tail number N97741?

13:50.394 --> 13:53.484
How the hell would I know?
I own a lot of planes.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.009
Okay, well, this particular
plane crashed this morning

13:56.052 --> 13:57.837
with your fingerprints
inside.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.839
Well, that's impossible.

13:59.882 --> 14:02.406
You got that right. You've been
incarcerated for 36 months,

14:02.450 --> 14:04.408
and those fingerprints
are fresh.

14:04.452 --> 14:05.801
So what the hell?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.585
I mean, that sounds
like a "you" problem.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.936
No, no. I think -- I think
something funny is going on.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.851
- I think it's him.
- I agree.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.157
Um, what is your wife's
name?

14:14.201 --> 14:15.289
Linda --

14:18.292 --> 14:19.510
I'm not married.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.166
And I need to see a lawyer.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.168
Sir, you're a federal inmate,
and I have every right

14:25.212 --> 14:27.214
to inspect
your person, so...

14:33.524 --> 14:36.266
Plastic-surgery scars.

14:36.310 --> 14:40.401
How much did Levi Lincoln
pay you to do his time?

14:40.444 --> 14:41.924
$5 million up front

14:41.968 --> 14:44.100
and $5 million upon
the completion of his sentence.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.624
Oh, you -- you should've held
out for more. The guy's loaded.

14:46.668 --> 14:50.324
Prisoners are fingerprinted
upon arrival, so someone here

14:50.367 --> 14:53.066
had to have helped you and Levi
pull this off. Who was it?

14:53.109 --> 14:55.372
If I tell you that,
I'll be dead by sundown.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.896
I'm not saying another thing
till I see a lawyer.

14:59.550 --> 15:00.900
You think the guards
were in on it?

15:00.943 --> 15:02.640
Or the warden. Or both.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.773
You know who would know...

15:04.816 --> 15:06.470
Oh, absolutely not.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.908
This is his prison.
He's been helpful in the past.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.953
This is because
you jinxed us.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.616
It's my favorite
law-enforcement officers!

15:21.659 --> 15:23.748
Wait. Don't tell me.
I have a son.

15:23.792 --> 15:24.967
I always wanted a boy.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.273
This isn't about you.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.101
Oh, you're seeing
other criminals. I'm hurt.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.711
What the hell
happened to you?

15:29.754 --> 15:31.931
Well, it turns out that you
snitch on one lifer too many,

15:31.974 --> 15:33.236
everybody turns on you.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.413
It's like junior high school
all over again.

15:36.457 --> 15:39.982
Oscar, are you familiar with
an inmate named Levi Lincoln?

15:40.026 --> 15:43.246
I am, and I know some
rather shocking things

15:43.290 --> 15:46.162
about Mr. Lincoln,
but it'll cost you.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.382
He's paying a double to serve
his time for him. We know.

15:48.425 --> 15:51.037
What we don't know
is who helped him.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.561
Well, I'll tell you
everything I know...

15:53.604 --> 15:55.998
but you have to get me
out of this prison.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.782
- Forget it.
- Given who I've pissed off,

15:57.826 --> 16:00.655
I'm looking at spending
the rest of my life here,

16:00.698 --> 16:02.787
in protective custody,
alone,

16:02.831 --> 16:05.790
with no one to talk to
but myself.

16:05.834 --> 16:08.358
I am concerned
for my sanity.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.491
So you want
a prison transfer.

16:10.534 --> 16:13.015
A letter of support from a cop
would go a long way.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.756
Fine.
I'll write a letter.

16:14.799 --> 16:17.193
Oh, that is so sweet,
but weren't you arrested

16:17.237 --> 16:19.021
for trying to murder
another police officer?

16:19.065 --> 16:21.067
I was exonerated!
You know that!

16:21.110 --> 16:22.329
I know, but still.

16:22.372 --> 16:23.852
Detective Harper?

16:23.895 --> 16:25.201
Sure.
Where do I send it?

16:28.378 --> 16:29.640
I know you know because --

16:31.816 --> 16:33.122
Hello?

16:33.166 --> 16:34.994
<i>Hey!</i> <i>
It's skip tracer Randy!</i>

16:35.037 --> 16:36.473
Randy, I know
you're a skip tracer.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.084
You don't have to tell me
every time.

16:38.127 --> 16:40.129
<i>You never know.</i> <i>
People are forgetful.</i>

16:40.173 --> 16:41.652
Did you get any information
on Jason Wyler?

16:41.696 --> 16:43.045
<i>Yes, sir, I did.</i>

16:43.089 --> 16:44.829
<i>Born in Chicago, 1984.</i>

16:44.873 --> 16:47.484
<i>Married Bailey Nune, 2016.</i>

16:47.528 --> 16:49.443
<i>Convicted of</i> <i>
embezzlement, 2019.</i>

16:49.486 --> 16:52.011
<i>He served two and a half years</i> <i>
of a six-year sentence</i>

16:52.054 --> 16:54.274
<i>at Lompoc and was paroled</i> <i>
last week.</i>

16:54.317 --> 16:56.537
That's it? No other arrests
or complaints against him?

16:56.580 --> 16:57.712
<i>I gave you all I've got.</i>

16:57.755 --> 16:58.974
<i>I'll invoice you</i> <i>
for my services.</i>

16:59.018 --> 17:00.106
<i>Randy out!</i>

17:02.891 --> 17:05.415
- Who's Jason Wyler?
- None of your business.

17:05.459 --> 17:08.331
I can help you a lot more
than "skip tracer Randy."

17:08.375 --> 17:11.204
You want the real scoop
on this Jason character...

17:11.247 --> 17:13.075
come holla at your boy.

17:13.119 --> 17:17.340
"Oscar Hutchinson has
provided limited assistance

17:17.384 --> 17:19.081
to the LAPD
on several cases."

17:19.125 --> 17:20.300
Oh, that's sweet.

17:20.343 --> 17:21.910
Now, which
prison personnel

17:21.953 --> 17:25.000
did Levi pay
to pull off this switch?

17:25.044 --> 17:28.090
The warden.
And four guards --

17:28.134 --> 17:31.441
Morrison, Clark,
Hobson, and Lane.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.790
Thank you.

17:34.357 --> 17:37.926
Oh, and, uh, I faxed this to
our station, not your lawyer.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.190
That's just mean!

17:41.234 --> 17:43.801
The guy in jail is a fake.
Levi paid him to do his time.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.716
Well, we got several
911 calls about a man

17:45.760 --> 17:47.414
parachuting near Echo Park,

17:47.457 --> 17:48.589
but he was gone by the time
the police got there.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.069
Any idea where he went?

17:50.112 --> 17:51.766
No. We're pulling footage,
but no hits yet.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.376
I tracked the Cessna's
flight path.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.770
It took off from Sonoma,
home to, among other things,

17:55.813 --> 17:57.989
one of Levi's many estates.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.209
Local police checked it out,
found the back yard dug up.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.690
That's where he got
the gold bars.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.909
So he hires someone
to do his time,

18:04.953 --> 18:07.521
heads south of the border,
finds an out-of-the-way place

18:07.564 --> 18:08.957
where no one will
recognize him.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.828
But he runs out of money,
and he knows he has gold

18:10.872 --> 18:13.135
stashed at the Sonoma house.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.137
And he knows he can't board
a commercial flight, so he flies

18:15.181 --> 18:17.661
the Cessna, has engine trouble,
and here we are.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.924
The rich.
They live just like us.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.926
So you're Levi.
Where to next?

18:23.624 --> 18:25.060
Well, he still needs money.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.715
So if he hid gold bricks
in his vacation home,

18:27.758 --> 18:29.717
what are we gonna find
in his mansion in L.A.?

18:29.760 --> 18:32.372
- Check it out.
- On it.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.853
Police. Open up.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.030
Can I help you?

18:39.074 --> 18:40.597
We're looking for
the homeowner, Mr. Lincoln.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.164
Mr. Lincoln's in prison.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.645
I'm taking care of his house
while he's away.

18:44.688 --> 18:47.256
Hurry up! Hurry up!

18:49.128 --> 18:52.174
Is -- Is he here?

18:52.218 --> 18:55.177
Back yard.
He's got Alfredo.

18:56.439 --> 18:57.353
Ma'am, come here.

18:57.397 --> 18:58.615
Step outside.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.708
Let's go. Come on.

19:04.752 --> 19:08.234
Dig! Faster!
Let's go, idiot!

19:08.277 --> 19:10.192
Hurry up!

19:10.236 --> 19:13.239
Come on!
Get the damn bag out.

19:13.282 --> 19:15.110
Come on. Faster!

19:21.247 --> 19:23.553
7-Adam-100. Shots fired
at our location.

19:23.597 --> 19:24.946
Send backup and airship.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.441
Control, 7-Adam-100.
Suspect is escaping

19:41.484 --> 19:43.878
on a black motorcycle,
headed east on Acorn.

19:45.923 --> 19:48.187
Levi got away, but we know
he's still desperate for money.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.319
We've compiled a list
of all of his acquaintances

19:50.363 --> 19:52.278
and potential money sources
across L.A. --

19:52.321 --> 19:53.627
anywhere he might
possibly show up.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.237
We should put a unit on
everyone. Squeeze him out.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.065
Alright. Send me that list.

19:57.108 --> 19:58.806
I'll use it to brief
the midnight shift.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.155
I'm sorry.
Uh, excuse me.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.330
Hello?

20:01.374 --> 20:03.245
Lucy,
it's Ashley McGrady.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.508
We met at my father's
retirement party.

20:05.552 --> 20:06.857
<i>Is this a good time?</i>

20:06.901 --> 20:09.556
Uh, yeah. Hey.
What's going on?

20:09.599 --> 20:10.818
<i>I have a problem.</i>

20:10.861 --> 20:14.648
I like Tim.
A lot.

20:14.691 --> 20:17.651
But his dog makes me
super nervous,

20:17.694 --> 20:19.914
and I-I know
he was yours first.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.264
So...why did you
give him away?

20:22.308 --> 20:24.266
Was he too aggressive?

20:24.310 --> 20:26.703
No! Not at all.
I-I mean, my living situation

20:26.747 --> 20:29.097
just wasn't suited
to having a pet.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.926
Uh, but Kojo
is the sweetest guy.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.929
I mean, do you --
do you not like dogs?

20:34.972 --> 20:38.019
I had a bad experience
when I was a kid.

20:38.062 --> 20:39.673
<i>I-I totally get it.</i>

20:39.716 --> 20:42.893
Listen. Think about it this way.
Kojo is just like --

20:42.937 --> 20:45.331
Well, I-I mean, he's
kind of just like Tim.

20:45.374 --> 20:48.290
He's big, gruff, a whole lot
of bark, but, you know,

20:48.334 --> 20:51.206
underneath all of it,
he's a -- he's a sweetheart.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.253
You know, you should, um, you
should tell Tim how you feel.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.342
No way. Never ask a man
to choose

20:56.385 --> 20:58.648
between his dog
and his girlfriend.

20:58.692 --> 21:01.260
There's a whole genre of country
songs that warn about that.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.393
- Anyway, I'm sorry to vent.
- No.

21:04.437 --> 21:06.221
<i>I'll let you
go back to your night.</i>

21:06.265 --> 21:07.353
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:07.396 --> 21:08.702
Oh. Oh.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.007
Are you Officer Chen?

21:10.051 --> 21:11.661
Uh, yeah, I am. Hi.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.533
Chris Sanford, DA's office.

21:13.576 --> 21:17.058
Did you cite out a drug dealer
named Tyler Stent earlier today?

21:17.101 --> 21:18.494
Yes. I did.

21:18.538 --> 21:21.105
But Tyler is a juvenile
on his first defense,

21:21.149 --> 21:22.890
so I wouldn't just label him
a "drug dealer."

21:22.933 --> 21:24.892
I know.
Your arrest report

21:24.935 --> 21:27.329
detailed his tale of woe
at length.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.244
Honestly, it's a good thing
this isn't going to trial.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.202
You pretty much just handed
the defense their case.

21:31.246 --> 21:32.726
I handed them the truth.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.162
You're not really that naive.

21:34.205 --> 21:35.685
No, I'm not.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.121
I'm trying
to protect this city.

21:37.165 --> 21:38.993
And because of you,
a criminal who was selling

21:39.036 --> 21:41.300
dangerous substances
is back on our streets.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.911
Really? So you think putting
a 16-year-old into juvie

21:43.954 --> 21:45.347
for a nonviolent offense

21:45.391 --> 21:47.436
is gonna turn the tide
in the war on drugs?

21:47.480 --> 21:49.046
<i>Now</i> who's being naive?

21:49.090 --> 21:50.918
How long have you been
on the job, Chris?

21:52.267 --> 21:53.573
Four months.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.139
Mm.
But that's not relevant.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.620
Okay. So, tell you what. Let's
give it a year and a half,

21:57.664 --> 21:59.318
and then you can come
and criticize my work.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.363
Alright?
Nice to meet you, Chris.

22:04.235 --> 22:07.021
- Good night. Get some sleep.
- Thanks.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.631
Get home safe.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.691
Perfect.

22:25.909 --> 22:26.997
Just what I need.

23:03.033 --> 23:05.427
Hello?

23:05.471 --> 23:07.647
I'm sorry for reaching out.
I just --

23:07.690 --> 23:09.039
I didn't know
who else to call.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.781
You alright?

23:11.825 --> 23:14.958
Yeah. I'm fine.
It's just been...a day.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.006
I know I'm the last person
you want to hear from right now,

23:19.049 --> 23:21.051
but I feel like

23:21.095 --> 23:24.315
if you and I just sat down,
I could explain.

23:28.102 --> 23:32.454
I really hope that's true,
but, um...

23:32.498 --> 23:34.456
I can't do it tonight.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.371
<i>I just need a little time</i> <i>
to get on top of how I feel.</i>

23:36.415 --> 23:39.287
You, um...

23:39.330 --> 23:40.549
broke my heart a little.

23:40.593 --> 23:42.029
I know.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.205
I would do anything
to take it back.

23:49.906 --> 23:52.518
I'll call you.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.139
Hey, guys.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.836
Your husband cannot
hold his liquor.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.839
Uh, I am fine.
Don't listen to him.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.188
Is James staying over
for dinner?

24:11.232 --> 24:12.451
Oh!
We're gonna get pizza.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.235
Mm. Ah, and --
and some garlic knots.

24:14.278 --> 24:16.498
Yes.
And garlic knots!

24:16.542 --> 24:19.022
Yep, yep, yep.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.764
So, what are you
gonna do with yourself

24:21.808 --> 24:23.592
for the next six months?

24:23.636 --> 24:26.726
I don't know.
S-Spend more time with Jack.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.162
Maybe get rid of the nanny.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.424
Over your dead body.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.860
Okay.

24:30.904 --> 24:33.036
Well, I could
always use your help

24:33.080 --> 24:34.603
over at
the community center.

24:34.647 --> 24:37.519
I mean, people come in with
legal questions all the time.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.303
Just yesterday,
a lady came in,

24:39.347 --> 24:42.219
didn't know whether her sister
should take a plea deal.

24:42.263 --> 24:44.787
Oh, man. Do not get me started
on plea deals --

24:44.831 --> 24:46.223
how they
disproportionately affect

24:46.267 --> 24:47.311
people in marginalized
communities.

24:47.355 --> 24:48.791
Yes. Exactly!

24:48.835 --> 24:50.619
I know.
Exactly.

24:50.663 --> 24:53.622
What's up?

24:53.666 --> 24:55.450
<i>Your boyfriend</i> <i>
is at my house.</i>

24:55.494 --> 24:56.886
What?

24:56.930 --> 24:58.845
Yeah. He and Wesley went out
drinking together.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.716
See? That-- That's
what I'm saying!

25:00.760 --> 25:02.762
- I know! A hundred percent!
- That's what I'm saying!

25:02.805 --> 25:04.459
Are they watching
a game?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.722
Mm, no.
Fixing the judicial system.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.376
Luckily,
Jack is at my mom's.

25:08.419 --> 25:10.117
We're ordering some pizzas.
Want to come over?

25:10.160 --> 25:11.684
On my way.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.468
Tim!
Hold up a second.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.383
Hey, did something
come in on Levi?

25:15.426 --> 25:19.605
Uh, no. Uh, you know
that call I took earlier?

25:19.648 --> 25:22.085
It was --
It was Ashley.

25:22.129 --> 25:23.870
Why is my girlfriend
calling you?

25:23.913 --> 25:26.176
She wanted to know
if Kojo was a dangerous dog,

25:26.220 --> 25:28.178
'cause you told her
he used to be mine.

25:28.222 --> 25:30.224
Okay.
That's ridiculous.

25:30.267 --> 25:32.618
I mean, he growled at her
a few times,

25:32.661 --> 25:33.836
but he's just
getting used to her.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.055
I-It's not a big deal.

25:35.098 --> 25:37.187
W-- It is to her.

25:37.231 --> 25:40.060
And you're so concerned
about my love life because?

25:40.103 --> 25:42.236
Because I don't want to drive
around on patrol with you

25:42.279 --> 25:44.630
while you are moping
about screwing this up.

25:44.673 --> 25:47.894
Look, if you like this girl,
you should listen to her.

25:52.986 --> 25:55.336
When have I ever moped?

25:55.379 --> 25:57.643
I don't even know how.
Mm-hmm.

26:06.303 --> 26:09.393
- Hello?
- Johnny? It's Oscar.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.831
Calling a cop
on a contraband cellphone

26:11.874 --> 26:13.572
is not the smartest.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.225
Fine.
I could just hang up

26:15.269 --> 26:17.924
rather than tell you what I
found out about your boy Jason.

26:21.449 --> 26:22.624
What did you find out?

26:22.668 --> 26:23.799
<i>First things first.</i>

26:26.236 --> 26:28.978
I need a letter faxed to my
lawyer's office by 8:00 a.m.

26:29.022 --> 26:31.807
supporting my appeal to
change prisons for my safety.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.200
I thought
I wasn't good enough.

26:33.243 --> 26:35.768
Beggars can't be choosers.
Do we have a deal?

26:37.117 --> 26:38.727
Yeah.
Now tell me what you found.

26:38.771 --> 26:41.643
Okay. I talked to a couple
of buddies of mine in Lompoc.

26:41.687 --> 26:45.386
Apparently, Jason Wyler is the
most charming man on the planet,

26:45.429 --> 26:47.257
and he's a cold-blooded
manipulator.

26:47.301 --> 26:48.911
Yeah,
but is he dangerous?

26:48.955 --> 26:50.565
I mean, he's serving time
for embezzlement.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.045
He wasn't violent.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.612
<i>From what I've heard,
he doesn't have to be.</i>

26:53.655 --> 26:55.352
He whispers
in all the right ears,

26:55.396 --> 26:57.964
and whoever is his enemy ends up
on the wrong end of a shank...

26:58.007 --> 27:00.096
with no way
to trace it back to him.

28:25.529 --> 28:28.141
So, alright.
Here's where we're at.

28:28.184 --> 28:30.665
So, we had eyes on Lincoln's
business associates

28:30.709 --> 28:32.145
and possible money sources

28:32.188 --> 28:34.234
all last night,
but Levi never showed.

28:34.277 --> 28:37.193
Well, maybe he left town without
getting his hands on any money.

28:37.237 --> 28:38.978
That doesn't seem likely.

28:39.021 --> 28:41.415
There's a certain standard
of living he likes to uphold.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.678
So we keep watching his rich
friends and hope for the best.

28:44.723 --> 28:48.030
You know, there is one rich
friend we're <i>not</i> watching.

28:48.074 --> 28:49.597
His double -- Lamar Sheff.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.860
Lincoln paid Sheff $5 million
up front to do the time,

28:51.904 --> 28:53.906
and there's no way
the double's family

28:53.949 --> 28:55.777
could spend it without
throwing up red flags.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.910
Sheff's wife
lives in Whittier.

28:57.953 --> 29:00.303
Harper, Nolan,
go check it out.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.828
First thing we have to do is
take your felony off the table.

29:02.871 --> 29:05.395
A felony conviction can be
a life sentence to poverty.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.310
It'll affect your
future job opportunities,

29:07.354 --> 29:09.225
applying for loans.

29:09.269 --> 29:10.531
Oh, man, so I'm screwed,
aren't I?

29:10.574 --> 29:12.446
Not if we use Prop 47.

29:12.489 --> 29:14.448
Wait. But that's for
personal drug use only.

29:14.491 --> 29:16.276
Yeah, but it's harder
to prove a sales case.

29:16.319 --> 29:18.931
And don't forget -- we have
a friendly arresting officer.

29:18.974 --> 29:20.759
This will get knocked back
to a misdemeanor possession,

29:20.802 --> 29:22.891
which means
no jail time for you.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.066
For real?
So I'm -- I'm good?

29:24.110 --> 29:25.807
Ha! Not even close.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.157
That's the easy part.
Now comes the hard.

29:28.201 --> 29:31.247
From this day on, you are here
every day after school, okay?

29:31.291 --> 29:32.640
We're gonna review
your homework,

29:32.683 --> 29:34.424
and if there's anything
that you want to talk about,

29:34.468 --> 29:35.556
we'll do that, too.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.340
And you're getting a job.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.129
Curtis.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.347
How you doing?

29:44.391 --> 29:46.785
Me? I'm alright.
I'll be a whole lot better

29:46.828 --> 29:49.526
once Lil' Man
hollers at me outside.

29:49.570 --> 29:52.399
Anything you want to say
to Tyler, you can tell us.

29:52.442 --> 29:53.617
And who's "us"?

29:53.661 --> 29:54.793
I'm part of Tyler's
legal team.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.838
Legal team.

29:56.882 --> 29:59.058
Alright. For real?

29:59.101 --> 30:00.799
Okay.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.322
So, check this out,
lawyer.

30:02.365 --> 30:04.498
Your client here entered
a verbal commitment with me

30:04.541 --> 30:06.935
over the sale
of certain items.

30:06.979 --> 30:09.895
Those items are now lost.
He owes me restitution.

30:09.938 --> 30:12.506
He's getting a job, but he'll
need some time to pay you back.

30:12.549 --> 30:14.638
With interest.
By tomorrow.

30:14.682 --> 30:16.684
Thirty days.
No interest.

30:18.425 --> 30:19.774
Excuse me?

30:19.818 --> 30:22.342
Curtis, do not
make this a thing.

30:22.385 --> 30:26.085
Aw. Nah. It's too late
for all that, James.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.391
Now, listen.

30:28.435 --> 30:30.916
I came in here alone
out of respect.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.613
In here,
this is your world.

30:32.656 --> 30:35.094
Out there, that's mine.

30:36.443 --> 30:38.271
I'll be seeing you,
Lil' Man.

30:41.317 --> 30:42.753
We got to find a place
for him to lay low

30:42.797 --> 30:44.799
while we work this out.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.933
I can, uh -- I can take him to
his aunt's place in Covina.

30:47.976 --> 30:49.978
Hey. Hey. Relax.
It's gonna be okay.

30:50.022 --> 30:51.501
But you got to go
to ground, okay?

30:51.545 --> 30:53.025
Stay off your phone.

30:53.068 --> 30:54.896
Don't tell anyone where you are.
You got it?

30:54.940 --> 30:57.377
Yeah.

31:01.947 --> 31:02.948
You okay?

31:02.991 --> 31:04.210
Yeah.

31:04.253 --> 31:07.039
Well, n-no. Yes. No.

31:07.082 --> 31:09.258
I talked to Oscar last night.

31:09.302 --> 31:10.477
What the hell for?

31:10.520 --> 31:12.044
He got intel on Jason.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.567
The <i>real,</i>
from inside the prison.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.308
And it turns out this guy's
as much of a nightmare

31:15.351 --> 31:18.093
as Bailey hinted at.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.182
Well, it doesn't excuse her
not telling you,

31:20.226 --> 31:22.097
but it does explain it.

31:22.141 --> 31:24.012
She probably still hasn't
dealt with the trauma.

31:24.056 --> 31:26.493
So what do I do?
Do I just...let it slide?

31:26.536 --> 31:28.974
If -- If Jason is
as dangerous as he says,

31:29.017 --> 31:30.584
then he could go
back after Bailey.

31:30.627 --> 31:33.369
Yeah, but Bailey's not exactly
a damsel in distress.

31:33.413 --> 31:36.285
I mean, you remember what
she did to that Russian spy.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.548
If he does make a move,
my money's on Bailey.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.385
Hey.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.866
What a, uh, nice surprise.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.477
Uh, I'm sorry.
I'm -- I'm all sweaty. Is --

31:54.521 --> 31:55.696
I know what you're doing.

31:55.739 --> 31:57.306
Mowing the lawn?

31:57.350 --> 31:58.829
Just stop with the games.

31:58.873 --> 32:01.876
Charming my co-workers,
pretending you want a divorce?

32:01.920 --> 32:03.573
I'm not buying it,
not for one second.

32:03.617 --> 32:05.140
You were in my house!

32:05.184 --> 32:07.186
What? No, I wasn't.

32:07.229 --> 32:10.102
But you're right about one
thing -- I don't want a divorce.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.842
I want things to go back
to the way they were.

32:11.886 --> 32:14.758
Uh, which part?
The part where you shamed me,

32:14.802 --> 32:18.023
belittled me, tried to control
everything in my life?

32:18.066 --> 32:20.721
Okay. Look.
I-I admit that I wasn't perfect.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.984
But you -- you needed help,
guidance, okay?

32:23.028 --> 32:24.986
E-Everything that I did,
I did for you.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.727
You abused me, Jason!

32:26.770 --> 32:28.250
Oh, come on. I never laid
a finger on you!

32:28.294 --> 32:29.512
You didn't have to!

32:29.556 --> 32:31.993
You isolated me from
my family and friends!

32:32.037 --> 32:34.474
You made me think
it was all my fault!

32:34.517 --> 32:36.476
You gaslit me to the point
of a breakdown!

32:36.519 --> 32:38.391
Could we talk about this later?

32:38.434 --> 32:40.784
Hell no!
We are talking about it now!

32:40.828 --> 32:43.091
When I left,
I was in pieces.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.875
And then I moved out here

32:44.919 --> 32:49.010
and I rebuilt my entire life
from scratch.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.925
I am not the same person
anymore.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.057
And neither am I!

32:52.100 --> 32:54.624
Shut up and listen to me.

32:54.668 --> 32:57.627
When I say I am not the same
person anymore, I mean it.

32:57.671 --> 32:59.586
And if you push me,

32:59.629 --> 33:03.590
I will push back harder
than you can imagine.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.200

33:07.420 --> 33:09.988

for my spirit.

42:09.091 --> 42:12.921
You really can't
let her be happy, can you?

42:12.965 --> 42:15.881
Couldn't stand that she
didn't need you anymore.

42:15.924 --> 42:18.492
Well...

42:18.536 --> 42:20.799
Well, your time is over.

42:20.842 --> 42:23.062
I know who you are now.

42:23.105 --> 42:24.672
And I'm coming for you.
