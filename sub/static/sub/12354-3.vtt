Viva Las Vegas, baby!

00:04.466 --> 00:06.930
You know you've been banned from
all betting areas? You need to leave.

00:06.964 --> 00:08.732
Marty's
b-school friend, Tamara.

00:08.767 --> 00:10.665
Well, if you've been doing
reading, then I'll shut up.

00:10.700 --> 00:12.541
Uh, would you?
Because that would be great.

00:12.576 --> 00:13.906
Dushkin!

00:13.940 --> 00:16.007
So, you're in town
consulting with Pincus, right?

00:16.041 --> 00:18.078
We're gonna build
a better goddamn casino.

00:19.015 --> 00:20.084
Our guy in Washington...

00:20.119 --> 00:21.755
That the restrictions
to online gambling

00:21.789 --> 00:23.056
are about to go bye-bye.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.325
Thanks, but no, thanks.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.795
She blew the deal

00:25.830 --> 00:27.731
and showed up
to the fucking party?

00:27.765 --> 00:29.499
Cat claw noise.

00:29.533 --> 00:30.867
What do you propose we do now?

00:30.902 --> 00:33.736
My dude Carlson
is the new king of Vegas.

00:33.770 --> 00:36.774
Look, I'm not implying that
you guys don't know Carlson.

00:36.808 --> 00:37.908
We're seriously tight.

my cle de peau liner?

it might be my liner.

03:06.292 --> 03:08.360
If you want to talk about your
makeup needs, we can do that.

03:08.394 --> 03:09.461
We can do that tonight.

Fine, I'll return
your cle de peau liner.

03:11.698 --> 03:14.033
Blend it a little.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.869
You know,

03:15.903 --> 03:18.071
if you buy him shitty makeup,

03:18.105 --> 03:20.073
then you're really telegraphing

03:20.108 --> 03:23.377
your disapproval of his
choice to be gender fluid.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.080
I'm not gonna get into it
with you over makeup,

03:26.114 --> 03:28.583
something that you know
dick about.

03:28.617 --> 03:31.186
Ah, you know, I've learned
a little bit about it

03:31.220 --> 03:33.121
over the last few years.

03:33.156 --> 03:34.990
Well, I know more,
and you're not his parent,

03:35.024 --> 03:36.625
so if you could just
shut the fuck up

03:36.659 --> 03:38.093
while I'm trying
to be his parent...

03:38.127 --> 03:40.295
Pardon me if I
don't take you seriously.

03:40.330 --> 03:43.165
I left my immersion
blender in the car.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.300
Okay.

Pardon me if I kick your ass
out of my house.

03:49.507 --> 03:51.241
Oh, that would be great
for Roscoe.

03:51.275 --> 03:53.277
Yeah, I think it would.
You know what?

03:53.311 --> 03:56.047
You put together six months
of sobriety...

03:56.081 --> 03:58.316
And I'll vanish. Poof!

03:58.350 --> 03:59.817
Who are you, Jeremiah?

03:59.851 --> 04:01.417
I mean, oh, you're like

04:01.450 --> 04:04.184

or something.

04:04.219 --> 04:05.519

04:07.055 --> 04:08.288
You need to read a book.

04:08.322 --> 04:10.156

sanctimonious old prick.

04:10.191 --> 04:12.959

04:12.993 --> 04:14.861
Okay, okay.

04:14.896 --> 04:17.197
Why are you... you're fucking...
Damn it!

04:17.231 --> 04:19.332

Okay, what is it?

04:19.366 --> 04:20.632
What is a hungry ghost?

04:20.666 --> 04:22.201
Mm-hmm.
So glad you asked.

04:22.235 --> 04:24.636
It's a creature
that can't be sated.

04:24.670 --> 04:27.038
Always trying to feed itself,

04:27.073 --> 04:32.310

to reach its tiny little mouth.

bullshit sandwich, but I'm full.

04:35.247 --> 04:36.214

04:36.248 --> 04:37.515
Hey, grandpa?

04:37.549 --> 04:40.117

so I can try to Ollie that gap?

04:40.152 --> 04:41.285
Yeah.

04:41.319 --> 04:42.652
Hey, let's Ollie the gap.

04:42.687 --> 04:43.987
We leave now.

04:44.021 --> 04:45.388
Ollie that gap.

04:45.423 --> 04:46.823
Oh, Roscoe. Wheat grass!

04:46.857 --> 04:48.458
No.

04:48.492 --> 04:49.959
It's good for ollieing.

04:49.994 --> 04:51.627
I just want to make sure we
have enough time to come back.

04:51.662 --> 04:52.962
Glad you like it.

04:52.996 --> 04:55.698
So, look, I say we get there
a little early,

04:55.732 --> 04:58.133
before it's 700 fucking
decibels of dubstep.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.168
And before we're
absolutely shit-faced.

05:00.202 --> 05:01.536
'Cause that is happening.

05:01.570 --> 05:02.971
Yeah, we're gonna drink beverages. Yeah.

05:03.005 --> 05:04.639
So, look, we're gonna
tee ourselves up

05:04.673 --> 05:06.507
with the douchebag twins
as kingmakers.

05:06.541 --> 05:07.674
You know, show them what we do,

05:07.709 --> 05:09.509
maybe even give them
a little entree

05:09.543 --> 05:11.577
into our, uh,
online gambling world.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.379
Maybe. Mmm, see
how it goes.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.247
Okay. And they're gonna show us

05:15.282 --> 05:17.883
that big-ass billion-dollar
Carlson wallet.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.352
Why don't we just set up

05:20.386 --> 05:21.586
a meeting with Carlson?

05:27.292 --> 05:28.826
Because he notoriously
hates outsiders,

05:28.860 --> 05:30.060
analysts, consultants.

05:30.095 --> 05:31.728
Considers himself--
what'd he say?--

05:31.763 --> 05:33.330
"the ultimate Maverick."

05:33.364 --> 05:35.098
Really? Renegade, huh?

05:35.132 --> 05:36.533
Oh, man, I've been there.

05:36.567 --> 05:37.935
Yeah. Yeah,
I get the feeling

05:37.969 --> 05:39.703
that Mr. Carlson
and Doug the gugg are,

05:39.737 --> 05:40.904
uh, gonna have a lot in common.

05:42.039 --> 05:43.139
You okay?

05:43.174 --> 05:44.274
Want me to get the waiter?

05:44.308 --> 05:45.275
No, I'm really gonna throw up.

05:45.309 --> 05:46.310
Waiter?
Don't ever refer

05:46.344 --> 05:47.311
to yourself in
the third person.

05:47.345 --> 05:49.714
And never as "Doug the gugg."

05:49.748 --> 05:51.215
That was a dramatic response.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.450
I disagree.
Use it from here on out.

05:52.484 --> 05:53.384
No.

05:53.418 --> 05:54.886
Nobody...
Doug the gugg.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.053
Don't ever fucking change.

05:56.088 --> 05:57.054
Uh-uh.

05:57.089 --> 05:58.222
It's a great nickname.

05:58.257 --> 05:59.390
Okay, so when
it's all said and done,

05:59.425 --> 06:00.758
factoring in
the after-work,

06:00.792 --> 06:02.426
what are we looking at in fees?

06:02.460 --> 06:03.961
Could be $40 million.

06:03.995 --> 06:06.029
Hmm. Could be 50.

06:06.064 --> 06:07.264
It could be.

06:07.298 --> 06:08.531
Not bad.

06:08.566 --> 06:11.701
And once Julianne Hofschraeger
spreads that around,

06:11.735 --> 06:14.070
puts the new bottega veneta
desk in her office,

06:14.104 --> 06:16.472
there's a decent
chunk of change left over

06:16.507 --> 06:17.773
for your bonus, Marty.

06:17.808 --> 06:19.542
Now you're getting it.

06:19.576 --> 06:22.278
I'm sorry, am I the only one
that does not understand

06:22.312 --> 06:23.646
why Marty still even
talks to her

06:23.680 --> 06:25.114
after she blew
the Pincus account?

06:25.148 --> 06:26.482
It's crazy, right?

06:26.516 --> 06:28.083
It's almost like
he respects her.

06:28.118 --> 06:30.119
I don't like you. I don't
care for you, either.

06:30.153 --> 06:32.188
Oh, Marty, Marty,
what was I thinking?

06:32.222 --> 06:33.189
Tamara.

06:33.223 --> 06:35.257
Um, since we both have

06:35.292 --> 06:37.960
the day off, would you
like to go to the spa?

06:37.994 --> 06:39.795
Seriously?
Yeah.

06:39.829 --> 06:41.196
I mean, we're both women.

06:41.231 --> 06:45.000
We... we work in a primarily
male-dominated environment.

06:45.034 --> 06:48.236
And I feel like, you know,
we should stick together

06:48.271 --> 06:50.639
and have girl bonding power.

06:50.673 --> 06:52.975
Okay. Let's... let's do it.
Thank you.

06:53.009 --> 06:54.510
All right, girl power.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.412
Did I hear something
about a spa?

06:56.446 --> 06:57.613
Nobody heard anything about a...? Nope.

06:57.647 --> 06:59.381
No. No, you did not.

06:59.416 --> 07:00.383
Huh.

07:02.519 --> 07:04.787
We're on our boat off of cabo,

07:04.822 --> 07:06.789
balls deep, dos chicas,

07:06.824 --> 07:08.291
and genius spots a sea turtle.

07:08.325 --> 07:09.425
And I'm all, "jump."

07:09.460 --> 07:10.760
And he's like,
"no fucking way."

07:10.794 --> 07:12.195
And I'm all,
"if you don't fucking jump,

07:12.229 --> 07:13.229
I am going to push you,"

07:13.263 --> 07:14.430
and he's all, "no!"

07:14.465 --> 07:15.632
And the motherfucker pushed me.

07:15.666 --> 07:17.133
Aah!

07:17.168 --> 07:19.969
Ah... stop playing
games. He pushed you in?

07:20.004 --> 07:21.504
In the agua, my friend.
Oh, yeah.

07:21.538 --> 07:22.972
Who could see that
fucking coming?

07:23.007 --> 07:24.941
Dude, that's my favorite
story you guys tell.

07:24.975 --> 07:26.643
Every time you say it,
I'm like, "ah, this is

07:26.677 --> 07:28.211
the best story I've heard
in my entire life."

07:28.245 --> 07:29.946
Dude, you know us.
We're always pushing

07:29.980 --> 07:31.881
the fucking envelope and shit.
Am I right, bro?

07:31.916 --> 07:33.783
100% right, bro.
That's what we're all about.

07:33.818 --> 07:34.784
Check it.
Yeah.

07:34.819 --> 07:36.152
Yo, Amber!
Yeah?

07:36.187 --> 07:37.521
Bring out the aks.

07:39.090 --> 07:40.523
Oh...

07:40.558 --> 07:42.325
Holy shit.

07:42.359 --> 07:43.693
You girls got guns.

07:43.727 --> 07:45.161
Baby doll got weapons, too.

07:46.496 --> 07:48.497
This is some top-secret
shit, fellas. Oh.

07:48.532 --> 07:50.532
Now that you've seen it,
we may have to kill you.

07:50.567 --> 07:52.401
Whoa.
Okay.

07:52.435 --> 07:54.402
Hey, Marty, do me a favor.
Say hello to my little friend.

07:54.437 --> 07:57.005
Hey, hello, little friend.

07:57.039 --> 07:59.042
Yeah, put your mouth on it.
Do what?

07:59.076 --> 08:00.378
Maybe...
Do it!

08:00.412 --> 08:02.047
Uh... for real?
Yeah, yeah.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.583
Come on, now.
All right, go.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.626
Holy shit, that's strong,
that's good.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.627
Yeah, it's sugary.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.328
Now do us, bitches.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.596
Yeah, do us, bitches!

08:17.631 --> 08:18.764
You're getting done.

08:18.799 --> 08:19.765
Open your mouth.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.574
Whoo! Awesome, right?

08:28.609 --> 08:30.609
You juggled the balls
a little bit there.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.344
Guys, these bad boys sell

08:32.379 --> 08:33.846
for 325 bucks a pop.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.081
You get to keep the gun.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.082
Hmm.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.384
Our price?
$1.50, all in.

08:38.419 --> 08:39.785
Do you see what I'm trying
to tell you, Marty?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.520
Brilliant. These guys
are fucking pure genius.

08:41.554 --> 08:42.822
Pure genius. Well, think about that.

08:42.857 --> 08:44.591
That's all profit, guys.
That's 100% profit.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.759
But you know what else
it makes me think about?

08:45.793 --> 08:47.060
Hmm?
What would you say

08:47.095 --> 08:49.129
the hottest club was
five years ago?

08:49.163 --> 08:50.964
Uh, ancient history.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.699
Wait, whoa, whoa.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.900
What about two years ago?

08:53.934 --> 08:56.569
Oh, wait. Um, was it...?
Who gives a fuck?

08:56.604 --> 08:58.605
Ah. Okay. No, I get it.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.040
Yeah.
So what you're saying is

09:00.074 --> 09:02.675
that your brilliant business
model is to pimp out your club

09:02.710 --> 09:05.078
that's gonna be ancient history
in two to five years?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.946
Yeah. Marty, we'll be fucking...

09:06.981 --> 09:08.214
You'll be what?

09:10.484 --> 09:12.585
You'll be forgotten
right along with it.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.920
Marty, come on.
Man.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.321
Hold on, Clyde.

09:15.356 --> 09:18.558
This is a bullshit, accelerated,
excess-fueled world

09:18.592 --> 09:20.727
with the half-life
of crÃ¨me fraÃ®che

09:20.761 --> 09:22.228
where nobody can remember

09:22.263 --> 09:24.764
what happened fucking two
years ago, let alone five.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.633
And you two fuckheads are
gonna be dead as dinosaur shit

09:27.667 --> 09:29.402
unless you start to realize

09:29.436 --> 09:33.239
that the best piece of capital
that you possess is you.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.241
Your names.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.610
Your brand.

09:37.644 --> 09:40.546
The dushkin... douchebags...

09:40.580 --> 09:43.582
Dushkin twin brand.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.751
Get your...

09:45.785 --> 09:47.986
You got to stop
putting your club's name first.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.254
You want to know why?

09:49.288 --> 09:50.656
'Cause you're
the fucking stars.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.858
You're the reason you're
netting over $50 million

09:52.892 --> 09:54.259
a year at war.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.762
What? How much?
50 fucking million dollars

09:56.796 --> 09:58.997
a year at war.
That's you guys.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.367
Not the mediocre DJs,
not the bullshit themes,

10:01.401 --> 10:03.169
not the business partners.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.504
You.
It's you.

10:04.538 --> 10:05.838
You guys are the stars.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.440
You got the big swinging dicks.

10:07.475 --> 10:08.608
Why don't you go out

10:08.643 --> 10:10.277
and make a fucking sex tape
with mila kunis?

10:10.311 --> 10:12.179
Just one? Oh, fuck. There's two of you?

10:12.213 --> 10:14.448
Tag-team that bitch
and make two of them.

10:14.482 --> 10:16.550
Time to be loud.

10:16.585 --> 10:17.785
Be the motherfucking product.

10:17.819 --> 10:19.486
Be the money. Listen to me.

10:19.521 --> 10:21.221
Be the brand.

10:21.256 --> 10:23.624
Fuck, yeah.

10:23.658 --> 10:25.392
Let's be the fucking brand.
Yeah, be the brand.

10:25.426 --> 10:27.294
Be the fucking brand.
I want to be in mila.

10:27.328 --> 10:28.662
Fuck! We're the fucking
brand.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.130
Dushkins!
Go to war!

10:30.164 --> 10:31.298
Let's go to war!

10:31.332 --> 10:32.666
Yeah, let's go to war.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.802
Dushkins
in the motherfucking house!

10:34.836 --> 10:39.573
Who cares that I was magna
cum laude at Columbia, or

10:39.608 --> 10:41.542
the youngest ever consultant... Jeannie?

10:41.576 --> 10:43.077
Accepted into galweather?

10:43.112 --> 10:45.312
It's not that you're not amazing

10:45.347 --> 10:47.482
and ambitious and talented.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.217
I mean, you are
a beautiful girl.

10:49.251 --> 10:50.618
Sensing there's a "but."

10:50.652 --> 10:53.688
I'm already senior to you,

10:53.722 --> 10:54.956
and I'm not threatened by you,

10:54.990 --> 10:56.858
and I'm sorry if you
feel threatened by me,

10:56.892 --> 10:59.360
because you don't have to.

10:59.394 --> 11:01.495
I'm not gonna get in your way
at galweather.

11:01.530 --> 11:05.099
Okay. Well, that's...
Great, I guess.

11:05.133 --> 11:08.402
Oh, and,

11:08.437 --> 11:10.771
you know, whatever's going on
between you and Marty

11:10.806 --> 11:13.107
is totally between the two
of you. I don't really...

11:13.142 --> 11:15.176
There's nothing going on
between Marty and I.

11:15.210 --> 11:16.177
Huh.
Really.

11:16.211 --> 11:17.245
Okay.

11:17.279 --> 11:19.180
No, like... nada.

11:19.214 --> 11:21.015
Okay.
Zero.

11:21.050 --> 11:23.017
Got it.

11:24.620 --> 11:27.021
This is so amazing.

11:27.056 --> 11:28.623
If anything,
I would have thought

11:28.657 --> 11:31.225
there was something going on
between you and Marty.

11:31.260 --> 11:34.096
Mmm. You know,

11:34.130 --> 11:36.698
that ship sailed
a long time ago.

11:36.732 --> 11:39.134
So there was a ship?

11:39.168 --> 11:42.138
Well, it was a little,
tiny boat, and it sailed.

11:42.172 --> 11:44.273
Well, I'm guessing
Marty fucked it up.

11:44.307 --> 11:46.642
Uh, actually, you know,
it was both of us.

11:46.677 --> 11:48.044
We were both

11:48.078 --> 11:49.579
so young and so competitive.

11:49.613 --> 11:53.583
I mean, neither one of us
were really ready for...

11:53.617 --> 11:56.286
You know what, Jeannie?

11:56.321 --> 12:00.224
Everything turned out exactly
the way that it was supposed to.

12:00.258 --> 12:01.825
And you met your husband.

12:01.860 --> 12:03.727
Yes. Kevin.
He's amazing.

12:03.761 --> 12:05.529
He's smart.
He's funny.

12:05.563 --> 12:07.765
He's... he's
an amazing dad.

12:07.799 --> 12:09.766
And I am a lucky girl.

12:09.801 --> 12:12.069
Gosh, how do you do it?

12:12.103 --> 12:16.273
You know, balancing marriage
and career and kids?

12:16.308 --> 12:18.208
Well, you do one thing
for a while

12:18.243 --> 12:19.610
until the other thing suffers,

12:19.644 --> 12:23.313
and then you swing back and
pay attention to the other.

12:23.347 --> 12:26.449
It's the most imperfect
system, and unfair,

12:26.484 --> 12:28.818
but honestly, I haven't seen
anything else work better.

12:28.853 --> 12:30.120
Mmm.

12:30.154 --> 12:32.623
Well, you make it look easy.

12:32.657 --> 12:34.258
Yeah, well,

12:34.292 --> 12:35.992
it's pretty much
always a cluster fuck.

12:36.027 --> 12:37.494
Nothing's ever easy.

12:37.528 --> 12:41.130
You know, maybe if you ever
have a family, you'll get it.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.635
Yeah. Maybe I will.

12:49.005 --> 12:50.973
Yeah.

12:51.007 --> 12:52.942
Wow.

12:52.976 --> 12:56.378
You know, my-my associates went
to a so-called high-end spa.

12:56.412 --> 12:57.646
Yeah?

12:57.680 --> 12:59.214
Yeah. High-end.

12:59.248 --> 13:00.649
Oh, please. Why?

13:00.683 --> 13:03.185
Because they-they float a few
cucumber slices in their water?

13:03.219 --> 13:05.520
Huh.

13:05.555 --> 13:07.723
You know, a massage should be
about the rubbing.

13:07.757 --> 13:08.890
Nothing more.
Yeah.

13:08.925 --> 13:10.325
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

13:10.359 --> 13:11.693
Just like that.

13:11.727 --> 13:13.128
Yeah, the rubbing.

13:13.162 --> 13:15.564
I think, as a culture,
we've-we've forgotten that.

13:15.598 --> 13:16.965
That's sweet.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.635
You know, we should be honoring
people like you, a proud--

13:20.670 --> 13:23.505
oh-- wage earner...
Mm-hmm.

13:23.540 --> 13:27.142
Plying her trade,
charging a fair price

13:27.177 --> 13:29.611
for a damn...
Good... rubdown.

13:29.646 --> 13:31.613
Oh.

13:31.648 --> 13:33.115
Instead, what do we do?

13:33.149 --> 13:34.583
We judge.

13:34.617 --> 13:37.186
We say, "well, she can't
be a good masseuse

13:37.220 --> 13:38.754
because she works
off the strip."

13:38.788 --> 13:40.189
Mm-hmm.

13:40.223 --> 13:41.690
"She doesn't use
scented candles."

13:41.725 --> 13:43.192
Mmm.

13:43.226 --> 13:46.128
"She doesn't sanitize
the table."

13:46.163 --> 13:48.064
Prostate?

13:48.098 --> 13:49.532
Yeah.

13:49.566 --> 13:52.101
Oh, it's effective apartheid,
if I'm being honest.

13:52.135 --> 13:53.836
Yeah, homey don't play that.

13:53.870 --> 13:55.871
Uh-uh. No, ma'am.

13:55.905 --> 13:57.839
Homey do not.

13:57.874 --> 13:59.274
Okay.

13:59.308 --> 14:01.276
Oh.

14:01.311 --> 14:03.345
Sh...

14:11.888 --> 14:17.192
Mmm. Oh. That was
fun tonight.

14:17.227 --> 14:18.694
Yeah.

14:18.729 --> 14:20.363
Some of the girls
don't dig it when

14:20.397 --> 14:22.098
I talk about noam chomsky.

14:23.867 --> 14:27.303
Yeah, I had a nice time
tonight. I...

14:27.337 --> 14:28.938
Mmm.

14:28.972 --> 14:31.207
It's good. Mmm.

14:31.241 --> 14:33.743
I think I should go inside.

14:33.777 --> 14:35.111
Okay.

14:35.145 --> 14:37.080
Yeah.
You're not, uh...

14:37.114 --> 14:39.149
You're not inviting me in?

14:39.183 --> 14:41.050
No.

14:41.085 --> 14:42.719
I have a son.

14:42.753 --> 14:44.254
Oh.
Yeah.

14:44.289 --> 14:45.522
Oh.

14:45.556 --> 14:47.590
Yeah. Well, I guess we
could go to my place.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.326
No. No, no, no. I want to go...
I wanted to go inside

14:50.361 --> 14:52.496
and just say good night
before he went to bed.

14:52.530 --> 14:54.497
Mm-hmm. What
about, uh...

14:54.532 --> 14:57.601
Wait, wait. What about, uh,
you know, just a little, uh...

14:57.635 --> 15:00.103
Relief?

15:01.906 --> 15:03.840
From what?
For the...

15:03.874 --> 15:07.010
Like, don't leave
me hanging. Right?

15:07.044 --> 15:09.212
What are you talking about? Just
get me off somehow, you know?

15:09.247 --> 15:10.647
Even if it's
just, like, a quick...

15:10.681 --> 15:11.948
Quick hand job.
Quickie, quick...

15:11.982 --> 15:13.283
Do you remember when I...?

15:13.317 --> 15:15.318
You remember how I said that
I had such a good time tonight?

15:15.352 --> 15:17.620
Yeah, yeah. So, look,
I'm pretty speedy.

15:17.654 --> 15:18.988
We could just...

15:19.022 --> 15:21.457
That was reflexive, like,
"God bless you" when you sneeze.

15:21.491 --> 15:22.625
Oh.
Because, truthfully?

15:22.659 --> 15:24.293
Uh-huh.
Listening to your fatuous,

15:24.327 --> 15:26.728
boring, hipster-elitist diatribe

15:26.763 --> 15:28.797
against free market capitalism
made me want to go

15:28.831 --> 15:31.699
purchase a gun and then put us
both out of our misery.

15:31.733 --> 15:34.535
I just got harder.

15:34.569 --> 15:35.702
I love angry chicks.

15:35.737 --> 15:37.704
Well, then,
you're gonna love this.

15:37.739 --> 15:38.939
Yeah.

15:38.973 --> 15:40.340
Go fuck yourself.

15:40.375 --> 15:43.511

I know who you are.

Hold up, hold up.

18:41.826 --> 18:44.460
I had sex in my full suit
last night.

18:44.495 --> 18:46.730
Oh, yeah, you should
get that dry-cleaned.

18:46.764 --> 18:48.498
That was an amazing
accomplishment.

18:48.532 --> 18:51.234
It's, like, top three of the
best things you've ever done.

18:52.837 --> 18:54.671
Hey, so, Marty,
what do you mean

18:54.705 --> 18:57.073
when you keep saying we,
like, got to be the brand?

18:57.107 --> 19:00.343
Oh. Ugh. I'm gonna
be honest with you, man.

19:00.377 --> 19:01.944
That was just
consultant mambo, man.

19:01.978 --> 19:03.345
We were just bullshitting.

19:03.379 --> 19:05.547
It's what we do.
Don't be mad at me.

19:05.582 --> 19:07.749
But you guys
are the shit, okay?

19:07.784 --> 19:08.917
That's true.

19:08.951 --> 19:10.118
I just want you to jump

19:10.152 --> 19:12.087
on that rocket ship
and take it all the way

19:12.121 --> 19:13.288
to planet ka-ching.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:13.322 --> 19:15.190
You can't push these guys, man.
Let them be.

19:15.225 --> 19:16.325
They're big boys, Clyde.

19:16.359 --> 19:17.860
They can hear a big idea.

19:17.894 --> 19:19.228
But that's a big fucking risk.

19:19.262 --> 19:20.563
That's a huge risk.

19:20.597 --> 19:23.433
Absolutely. And huge risk
leads to huge rewards.

19:23.467 --> 19:24.801
Because war is gonna look like

19:24.835 --> 19:26.436
a teeny-tiny,
little antiquated

19:26.470 --> 19:27.771
colonial fucking williamsburg

19:27.805 --> 19:29.707
compared to what's
coming down the pipe.

19:29.741 --> 19:31.175
You need to be on that shit.

19:31.209 --> 19:32.476
We're talking $500 million.

19:32.511 --> 19:34.345
These guys do not have
that type of money.

19:34.379 --> 19:36.547
Oh, so you're the consultant
and the accountant now?

19:36.582 --> 19:39.583
Oh, okay, because I'm Jewish, I'm
the fucking accountant? Fuck you, man.

19:39.618 --> 19:41.318
I make one dumb little
Sammy Davis Jr. joke,

19:41.353 --> 19:42.954
and now I'm an anti-semite?
Sammy is more Jewish

19:42.988 --> 19:44.055
than he is black.

19:44.089 --> 19:45.123
Oh, you're a racist.

19:45.157 --> 19:46.190
No, you're the racist.

19:46.225 --> 19:47.341
You don't think
Jewish people can dance.

19:47.359 --> 19:49.060
Whoa...!

19:49.094 --> 19:50.461
Hey! Whoa!

19:52.264 --> 19:55.399
Okay. Just for a
second, humor me.

19:55.433 --> 19:57.301
Now, let's just say
we do have $500 million.

19:57.335 --> 19:59.069
What are you frontin' about?

19:59.104 --> 20:00.337
We're not fronting.

20:00.372 --> 20:01.606
No, no, no, stop.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.641
We signed
a confidentiality agreement.

20:03.675 --> 20:05.743
I apologize.
We can eat this food...

20:05.777 --> 20:07.211
Oh, fuck that, Clyde!
Did your boys

20:07.245 --> 20:08.746
not get you seriously
laid last night?

20:08.780 --> 20:10.080
I'm saying, man,

20:10.115 --> 20:12.483
why don't you try respecting
the fuck-terntity, Clyde.

20:12.517 --> 20:15.085
Tell them.
For real?

20:15.119 --> 20:16.386
For real for real.

20:19.290 --> 20:21.257
Social media gaming.

20:21.292 --> 20:23.927
We have exclusive
access-- that is

20:23.961 --> 20:25.595
first-right refusal
to a web site

20:25.630 --> 20:28.164
that is gonna fucking rock
the fucking world.

20:28.199 --> 20:29.699
Oh, man, it's
instant monetization.

20:29.734 --> 20:31.167
: It's... it's perfection.

20:31.202 --> 20:33.603
It's Facebook while you spend
a couple of bucks betting

20:33.637 --> 20:35.271
with your social network.
Think about it.

20:35.305 --> 20:37.006
You're alone, by yourself,
comfortable, sweat pants,

20:37.040 --> 20:39.275
looking at pics of your family,
farting around,

20:39.309 --> 20:42.278
while we bleed you dry
with a tiny juice box straw.

20:42.312 --> 20:43.879
Tell them about caesars.
It's legal

20:43.913 --> 20:45.147
overseas already, man.
Caesars is

20:45.181 --> 20:47.049
fucking killing it over there.
Billions.

20:47.083 --> 20:49.218
Billions. Billions... in revenue.

20:49.253 --> 20:50.720
It's totally untapped.

20:50.755 --> 20:53.189
Yeah, I know.
And it'd be awesome if...

20:53.224 --> 20:55.024
If it was legal here.

20:55.059 --> 20:56.559
Oh, exactly, my man.

20:56.593 --> 20:59.962
No. If it was legal
in the states, but exactly.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.564
All right.

21:01.598 --> 21:04.000
What the fuck was that?

21:05.268 --> 21:08.070
Oh! You motherfuckers
have inside intel, huh?

21:08.105 --> 21:09.905
Can I say we know?

21:09.940 --> 21:13.075
Let's just say
maybe we know. Maybe.

21:13.109 --> 21:15.477
It doesn't fucking matter
anyway, because...

21:15.512 --> 21:18.347
Turns out our guy Pincus
is a complete pussy.

21:18.381 --> 21:19.581
He ain't a baller.

21:19.615 --> 21:21.082
He's an asshole.
Yep.

21:21.117 --> 21:23.218
We got your back, homey.

21:23.253 --> 21:24.920
Don't know what
that means, homey.

21:24.954 --> 21:26.922
It means we got the
fucking guy, Clyde.

21:26.956 --> 21:29.158
He is gonna eat this shit up.

21:29.192 --> 21:30.493
He most certainly
has the scrilla.

21:31.628 --> 21:33.562
Oh, wait, are you guys
talking about Carlson?

21:33.597 --> 21:35.030
What good does that do us?

21:35.065 --> 21:36.532
He's a total inner-circle guy.

21:36.567 --> 21:38.701
We can't even
get next to that dude.

21:38.735 --> 21:39.902
Yes, you can.

21:39.936 --> 21:41.237
We'll make the intro.

21:41.271 --> 21:43.940
We'll put the club
in the vibrato, dude.

21:43.974 --> 21:45.441
Just give us a little taste.

21:45.475 --> 21:46.542
Tasty.

21:48.712 --> 21:50.847
Nummers. Num, num,
num, num. Tasty, tasty.

21:50.881 --> 21:52.081
Num, num, num, num, num!

21:52.115 --> 21:53.349
Aah!

21:53.383 --> 21:55.384
I like tastes.

21:55.418 --> 21:56.952
Who doesn't like tastes?

21:56.987 --> 21:58.454
Taste!

22:08.698 --> 22:10.733
Yeah. W...

22:10.767 --> 22:12.868
W...

22:12.903 --> 22:15.271
No, you're talking like you have
a bag of dicks in your mouth.

22:15.305 --> 22:17.774
Yeah, well, can you please...

22:19.276 --> 22:21.878
Good, then get to a landline.

22:27.451 --> 22:29.319
Come on.
This is your shot.

22:29.353 --> 22:32.556
Oh. Um, all right, well,
as you can see from the deal...

22:32.590 --> 22:33.590
Why would you even take

22:33.625 --> 22:35.292
this call on a fucking mobile,

22:35.326 --> 22:36.660
anyway?

22:36.694 --> 22:38.061
Am I so unimportant

22:38.096 --> 22:41.398
that you could just talk on
your shitty little iPhone

22:41.432 --> 22:43.933
while I'm tying to do
real business?

22:43.968 --> 22:45.835
Go ahead.

22:45.869 --> 22:48.938
Uh, the deal
that we are proposing,

22:48.973 --> 22:51.241
as you can see,
it's potentially far more

22:51.275 --> 22:53.643
lucrative... okay, I'm about
to put a bullet in this deal.

22:53.677 --> 22:55.645
This deal? It's a little better,

22:55.680 --> 22:56.947
yes, thank you.

22:58.316 --> 22:59.950
Come on, let's go.

23:01.552 --> 23:04.788
This deal is
potentially far more lucrative

23:04.822 --> 23:06.689
than, um...
We believe exponentially

23:06.724 --> 23:07.991
more lucrative

23:08.025 --> 23:09.459
than your standard
brick-and-mortar options.

23:09.494 --> 23:11.127
That's right, sir.

23:11.162 --> 23:12.796
Which you've already made
extremely profitable.

23:12.830 --> 23:15.365
But the sky is the
limit. No, I'm not talking

23:15.399 --> 23:16.466
to you, bag of dicks.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.668
Just hold on a minute.
Go ahead.

23:17.702 --> 23:19.536
This is a client base

23:19.570 --> 23:20.937
that is utterly untapped.

23:20.972 --> 23:22.005
Mr. Carlson...

23:22.039 --> 23:23.640
Michael...

23:23.675 --> 23:25.075
Mr. Carlson,
we're talking about

23:25.110 --> 23:27.144
an entire gaming audience
of potentially

23:27.178 --> 23:28.345
billions of new users.

23:28.380 --> 23:29.980
And the entire country

23:30.014 --> 23:32.716
can't... the entire world
can't come to Vegas.

23:32.751 --> 23:34.985
What we're proposing is that...
Jeannie.

23:35.020 --> 23:36.787
Just give me a second.
This is a good point.

23:36.822 --> 23:38.456
Um, what we're proposing

23:38.490 --> 23:39.990
is that we bring Vegas Jeannie...

23:40.024 --> 23:40.991
To the new...

23:41.025 --> 23:42.226
You think he's listening to you?

23:42.260 --> 23:43.727
He's looking at your tits.

23:43.761 --> 23:45.662
We're out of here.
Wait. Come on.

23:45.696 --> 23:47.030
Let's go.
Hey, hey, hey.

23:47.064 --> 23:48.031
Okay, you know what?

23:48.065 --> 23:50.400
Fuck off. Okay.

23:50.435 --> 23:52.402
You know what, we're gonna
take our show down the road,

23:52.436 --> 23:54.238
but thanks for the undivided
attention. Really.

23:54.272 --> 23:55.539
I'm saying okay.

23:55.573 --> 23:57.040
I'm saying yes.

23:57.075 --> 23:58.608
But only on a
pay-per basis.

23:58.643 --> 23:59.876
You guys close the deal,

23:59.911 --> 24:01.879
and I'll pay the freight.

24:01.913 --> 24:04.047
Till then, you work on spec.

24:04.082 --> 24:06.918
So I... thank you,
I guess.

24:06.952 --> 24:10.288
And you guys are available
to me, okay?

24:10.322 --> 24:13.258
I call, you get here
on the first-- not the second,

24:13.292 --> 24:15.694
not the third-- flight,
you hear me?

24:15.728 --> 24:17.463
Absolutely, sir. And just remember

24:17.497 --> 24:19.098
that I fucking hate you.

24:19.132 --> 24:20.732
I hate consultants.

24:20.767 --> 24:23.502
I hate the way
you do business, I hate

24:23.536 --> 24:26.772
what you stand for, I hate
your billing practices,

24:26.806 --> 24:28.106
I hate that you ride
on the entrepreneurial vision

24:28.140 --> 24:29.841
of people like myself,
and if I could do

24:29.876 --> 24:31.043
this deal without you, I would.

24:31.077 --> 24:33.679
And if you guys prove
to be anything less

24:33.714 --> 24:36.249
than totally effective,
I will do this deal without you,

24:36.283 --> 24:39.719
and you can try to outspend me
in a court of law.

24:39.754 --> 24:41.721
Okay.
Okay, and don't

24:41.756 --> 24:43.323
patronize me, motherfucker...

24:43.357 --> 24:46.126
Or I will separate you
from your balls.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.694
Uh...

24:47.729 --> 24:49.029
You know what, Mike?

24:49.063 --> 24:51.898
We're gonna go make this
happen for you, okay?

24:51.933 --> 24:53.533
So why don't you stand down

24:53.568 --> 24:56.370
and let us make you some money.

24:57.439 --> 24:58.672
Okay.

24:58.707 --> 25:00.374
Make me some money.

25:00.409 --> 25:03.110
Good-bye.
Bye-bye.

25:03.145 --> 25:06.647
You fucking freak.

25:15.892 --> 25:17.493
Well...

25:17.527 --> 25:19.728
Hey, you know,
at least we got the job.

25:19.763 --> 25:20.963
Shut up, Doug.

25:20.997 --> 25:22.364
Do we celebrate?

25:22.398 --> 25:24.199
Yay!
I need a drink.

25:24.234 --> 25:26.134
Uh, correction:
I need to drunk.

25:26.169 --> 25:27.636
Uh, yeah, drink till drunk.

25:27.670 --> 25:28.971
I could get with that.

25:29.005 --> 25:31.306
Maybe the douchebags will hook
us up. You know what, guys?

25:31.341 --> 25:32.708
Fuck all this moping, okay?

25:32.742 --> 25:34.910
'Cause we got this
motherfucker on the ropes!

25:34.944 --> 25:37.946
All we have to do is wrestle
this thing into submission,

25:37.981 --> 25:40.148
and we're gonna be
the stuff of legends.

25:40.183 --> 25:41.817
And there's
the look. What?

25:41.851 --> 25:43.252
I-I didn't say anything.

25:43.286 --> 25:45.420
Okay, it's not the
holy fucking grail,

25:45.455 --> 25:48.057
but it's...
It's a big win.

25:48.091 --> 25:51.227
It's a win for galweather.
It's a win for me.

25:51.261 --> 25:53.429
It's a win for all of us. Right.

25:53.464 --> 25:55.765
Fuck it, I will drunk to that.

25:55.799 --> 25:57.267
Good. Everybody's
getting wasted.

25:57.301 --> 25:58.334
Dougy Doug.

25:58.369 --> 26:00.103
Uh, well, no,
actually, not me, guys.

26:00.137 --> 26:01.604
I've already booked
another massage,

26:01.638 --> 26:03.439
so, uh, I'll catch up with you.

26:03.474 --> 26:04.540
All right.
Yeah.

26:04.575 --> 26:06.242
All right.

26:10.313 --> 26:11.547
All right, sir,

26:11.581 --> 26:13.015
I'll let you get dressed.

26:13.049 --> 26:14.917
Ooh, no,

26:14.951 --> 26:18.687
no, no, not quite
done yet, are we?

26:18.721 --> 26:20.856
I really think we are.

26:20.890 --> 26:22.691
Oh... no,

26:22.725 --> 26:25.026
I don't think so, pepper.

26:25.060 --> 26:27.495
There we go. There.

26:27.529 --> 26:29.130
Sir, I'm calling security.

26:29.164 --> 26:31.232
What? What? No. No.

26:31.266 --> 26:32.666
No, no, hold on.

26:32.700 --> 26:34.334
Come on!
Whoa!

26:34.368 --> 26:35.502
Oh, it's not necessary.

26:35.536 --> 26:36.971
Come on.

26:37.005 --> 26:39.507
Uh, hold on. Before you poke
the finger... point the finger,

26:39.541 --> 26:41.976
I can explain, honestly.
No, no, no, no, no.

26:42.010 --> 26:42.977
No, wait, wait!
