What's the matter Mr. Good,

00:06.250 --> 00:07.784
can't sleep?

00:07.852 --> 00:09.419
You know, he's haunting you.

00:09.487 --> 00:12.055
If anyone deserves
to be haunted...

00:12.123 --> 00:13.590
You've done nothing
to deserve this.

00:13.658 --> 00:15.992
Well, I always just kind of
assumed you knew.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.827
Knew what? Do you remember
that night you dreamed

00:17.895 --> 00:19.362
<i>that lady was</i>
<i>gonna kill my brother,</i>

00:19.430 --> 00:20.764
<i>you called me to warn me,</i>

00:20.831 --> 00:23.567
I told you that it was too late,
it'd already happened?

00:24.335 --> 00:25.735
I lied.

00:25.803 --> 00:27.971
Oh, my God.

00:28.039 --> 00:29.839
You let him die.

00:29.907 --> 00:31.808
I'm fighting for my life
here, Allison,

00:31.876 --> 00:34.110
for my job, for my future.

00:34.178 --> 00:36.680
I think you'll get back
everything you started with,

00:36.747 --> 00:38.315
except for my friendship.

Lee, are you here?

01:00.838 --> 01:02.439
Do you have the baby?

01:02.506 --> 01:04.774
Yeah, I got her.
I'm in the kitchen.

01:09.146 --> 01:10.247
Hi.

01:10.314 --> 01:12.082
Oh, what happened?

01:12.149 --> 01:14.451
Did you wake up hungry
and Mommy not here?

01:14.518 --> 01:16.920
Did Daddy give you a bottle?

01:16.988 --> 01:18.622
He didn't feed her;
I-I fed her.

01:18.689 --> 01:21.291
Who are you? What are
you doing in my home?

01:21.359 --> 01:24.194
Oh, I'm-I'm Paul,
Lee's older brother.

01:25.363 --> 01:26.796
Beautiful kid, yeah.

01:26.864 --> 01:29.466
I fed her, and she
gobbled it right up.

01:29.533 --> 01:30.700
It's not formula.

01:30.768 --> 01:32.569
Something better.

01:32.637 --> 01:34.237
Something I whipped up myself.

01:34.305 --> 01:36.473
What are you talking about?

01:36.540 --> 01:38.675
She doesn't eat solid food yet.

01:38.743 --> 01:40.944
Oh, I don't know,
she loved this.

01:41.012 --> 01:42.279
You want some?

01:42.346 --> 01:44.981
I put the leftovers
in the fridge.

01:57.928 --> 02:00.130
Oh...

02:00.197 --> 02:01.865
Lee, you okay?

02:01.932 --> 02:04.267
Yeah.

02:04.335 --> 02:07.370
Same thing.
I can't sleep.

02:07.438 --> 02:09.705
Nightmares,
nothing but nightmares.

02:09.774 --> 02:11.741
Lee, how long can this go on?

02:11.809 --> 02:13.510
I don't know
what to tell you.

02:13.577 --> 02:17.414
I've seen three doctors,
taken all kinds of pills.

02:20.151 --> 02:23.753
I want what you want--
I want to sleep.

02:23.821 --> 02:27.390
I want to get some rest.

02:27.458 --> 02:29.459
Oh...

02:33.864 --> 02:37.000
Hey, I'm sorry,
Mr. Good, Mrs. Good,

02:37.068 --> 02:39.569
Baby Good.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.805
Am I keeping you up?

02:42.973 --> 02:44.874
Well, don't worry,

02:44.942 --> 02:48.278
it's a short-term problem.

02:48.346 --> 02:50.747
The dead don't sleep.

03:36.001 --> 03:37.969
Look at all the states

03:38.036 --> 03:40.171
Now, according to this,
Hanover, New Hampshire,

03:40.238 --> 03:43.739
is a little over
ten inches away

03:43.841 --> 03:46.542
from Phoenix,
so that's about...

03:48.279 --> 03:51.114
...2,500 miles away.

03:51.181 --> 03:52.582
Excellent work, Bridge.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.717
Your math teacher
would be very proud.

03:54.785 --> 03:56.286
Yes, bravo on the math,

03:56.353 --> 03:58.655
but I'm a little worried
about how gleeful you are

03:58.722 --> 04:00.790
about your sister
being so far away.

04:00.858 --> 04:03.259
Hey. I take good news
where I can get it.

04:03.327 --> 04:06.195
That's so far away.
Yeah.

04:06.263 --> 04:07.964
The only way that she
could be any farther

04:08.032 --> 04:09.299
would be if she went
to school

04:09.366 --> 04:11.768
in a foreign country
or something.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.469
That's too much
to hope for.

04:13.537 --> 04:15.138
Bridgette.
If we're lucky,

04:15.205 --> 04:16.839
we'll never have
to see her again.

04:16.906 --> 04:20.476
But I don't want to
never see Ariel again.

04:20.543 --> 04:22.278
Bridgette, you're starting
to scare her now.

04:22.346 --> 04:23.513
Don't worry, sweetie.

04:23.580 --> 04:24.948
We're going to see plenty
of Ariel.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.382
We're all going to fly up there

04:26.450 --> 04:27.650
for parents weekend,

04:27.718 --> 04:29.352
and that's less than
two months away.

04:29.420 --> 04:31.020
Who has been going
through my stuff?

04:31.088 --> 04:35.158
I told you two to stay out
of my room while I am packing.

04:35.225 --> 04:37.060
You know, it just
occurred to me--

04:37.127 --> 04:38.194
I'm not a
parent, so why

04:38.262 --> 04:40.830
do I have to go
to this parent weekend thing?

04:40.898 --> 04:42.365
I'm talking to you.

04:42.433 --> 04:45.668
I can tell that somebody
has been nosing through my stuff

04:45.736 --> 04:49.072
and messing up my piles,
and I want it to stop.

04:49.139 --> 04:51.741
Ariel, I would never touch
your things.

04:51.809 --> 04:54.610
Okay. Now, what about you?

04:54.678 --> 04:57.280
First of all, I haven't even
been in your room.

04:57.348 --> 04:59.415
Second of all,
why would I even touch

04:59.483 --> 05:01.784
your cootie-ridden stuff
in the first place?

05:01.852 --> 05:03.987
We've done a wonderful
job, darling.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.955
Yeah, I was just thinking
the same thing.

05:06.023 --> 05:08.992
Ariel, are you still taking
the girls to school?

05:09.059 --> 05:10.727
Do I have to?

05:10.794 --> 05:13.029
Think someone could
use a good walk.

05:13.097 --> 05:14.664
Ariel.

05:17.868 --> 05:20.570
She must have been adopted.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.776
Dartmouth.

05:26.844 --> 05:28.911
You done good, kiddo.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.881
Grandpa?

05:33.183 --> 05:35.718
Oh, yeah. Been a
while, hasn't it?

05:35.786 --> 05:37.854
You know, when we
last saw each other,

05:37.921 --> 05:39.122
you were wondering
what teacher

05:39.189 --> 05:40.990
you were going to get
for fourth grade.

05:44.495 --> 05:46.529
Okay, quit staring at me.

05:46.597 --> 05:47.764
It's making me uncomfortable.

05:47.831 --> 05:48.831
What's the matter?

05:48.899 --> 05:50.466
You never saw
a dead relative before?

05:51.502 --> 05:53.002
No.

05:53.070 --> 05:54.270
Well, relax.

05:54.338 --> 05:56.339
I'm around more than you think.

05:56.407 --> 05:59.275
And I like to keep an eye
on things.

05:59.343 --> 06:01.277
And I even check in
with your mom,

06:01.345 --> 06:03.846
you know, from time to time.

06:03.914 --> 06:06.616
Which is why
I am glad that you

06:06.683 --> 06:09.986
are finally old enough
to, uh, handle a visit

06:10.054 --> 06:12.655
from your dear old
departed granddad.

06:12.723 --> 06:14.490
'Cause you got a problem.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.027
I have a problem?

06:18.095 --> 06:19.362
Ah.

06:19.430 --> 06:21.931
Indeed, you do.

06:21.999 --> 06:25.268
See, you're going off to school
in a few days.

06:25.335 --> 06:28.071
Very excited,
and who wouldn't be?

06:28.138 --> 06:32.608
But your sister is having
a very hard time with it,

06:32.676 --> 06:36.079
and you are so busy,
you don't even notice it.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.147
She's upset,

06:38.215 --> 06:41.184
and she feels that she's going
to lose you forever,

06:41.251 --> 06:43.753
and if you don't do something
about it before you leave,

06:43.821 --> 06:45.955
she is going to have
a very rough go

06:46.023 --> 06:47.423
for the next few months.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.160
Okay. Well, how do I help?

06:51.228 --> 06:52.728
And what... what do I do?

06:52.796 --> 06:54.964
Who do I look like, Dr. Phil?

06:55.032 --> 06:56.966
I don't know
how girls talk to each other,

06:57.034 --> 06:58.768
and I don't want to know.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.970
I see a problem, I point it out.

07:01.038 --> 07:04.107
You have
a sister issue.

07:05.142 --> 07:06.909
Fix it.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.813
Girls are in the kitchen
waiting.

07:10.881 --> 07:12.682
Okay. I'll be
right there.

07:12.749 --> 07:14.884
If you and Bridge
could lower the volume

07:14.952 --> 07:17.186
on the sisterly love,
that would be great.

07:17.254 --> 07:19.155
I think it's really starting
to affect Marie.

07:19.223 --> 07:20.556
Of course.

07:20.624 --> 07:22.291
Actually, I'm a little concerned
about Marie, too.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.327
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

07:24.394 --> 07:26.195
Good.

07:42.513 --> 07:44.113
I've been
waiting for you.

07:45.916 --> 07:49.085
My name is Caroline
Krueger, and...

07:49.153 --> 07:51.220
I need your help
with something.

07:52.256 --> 07:53.923
I figured if I
got to you early,

07:53.991 --> 07:56.292
before there were a
lot of people around,

07:56.360 --> 07:58.060
this would be easier.

07:58.128 --> 08:00.630
I'm sorry. Did one
of the paralegals send you over?

08:00.697 --> 08:02.064
Or the district attorney or...?

08:02.132 --> 08:04.834
No. No one sent me over.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.903
No one can see me.

08:06.970 --> 08:08.938
No one but you.

08:11.775 --> 08:13.142
So you're...

08:13.210 --> 08:16.045
Going on ten months now.

08:16.113 --> 08:20.383
I won't bore you with all
the gruesome details,

08:20.450 --> 08:25.087
but I'd really like it if
someone would let my folks know.

08:26.790 --> 08:28.791
Okay.

08:30.127 --> 08:31.894
How do you spell your name?

08:31.962 --> 08:34.397
Uh, Krueger, with a "K."

08:34.464 --> 08:36.065
Like Freddy.

08:36.133 --> 08:39.769
Uh, first name
Caroline, with a "C."

08:39.836 --> 08:41.636
So, yeah, I'm buried

08:41.705 --> 08:44.140
out in the Sonora desert.

08:44.207 --> 08:47.109
Right past the Yucca exit
on Route 18.

08:47.177 --> 08:50.947
There is an old abandoned well
on the eastbound side.

08:51.014 --> 08:54.450
I'm about 40 yards behind it,

08:54.518 --> 08:57.820
and about four feet down.

08:57.888 --> 08:59.889
Uh, I'm wearing this.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.927
I can hear my mother

09:04.995 --> 09:08.264
praying every day
that they find me.

09:08.332 --> 09:11.167
I...

09:11.235 --> 09:14.604
it'd be nice
if she could move on.

09:25.382 --> 09:27.049
<i>She's dead, sir.</i>

09:27.117 --> 09:28.184
Someone murdered her.

09:28.252 --> 09:30.052
I think I know
where her body is buried.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.455
It's off of Route 18.

09:32.522 --> 09:34.390
The Yucca exit.

09:34.458 --> 09:37.026
Unfortunately, Yucca's outside
our jurisdiction.

09:37.094 --> 09:39.462
They have their own DA,
their own sheriff's department.

09:39.529 --> 09:41.364
I don't think I can call them
and suggest

09:41.431 --> 09:43.065
they start scouring the desert
for this girl.

09:43.133 --> 09:45.067
They wouldn't really
have to scour.

09:45.135 --> 09:48.471
I mean, she gave me a very clear
idea of where we could find her.

09:48.538 --> 09:50.406
I'm not going to lie to you.

09:50.474 --> 09:52.241
Yucca's not my favorite place.

09:52.309 --> 09:55.244
Uh, I'm not crazy about the way
they do things there.

09:55.312 --> 09:56.812
What do you mean?
What's so different

09:56.880 --> 09:59.582
about the way
they do things in Yucca?

10:00.984 --> 10:04.654
Forecast says it's
going to hit 115 today.

10:04.721 --> 10:07.857
Sure would break my heart
to see one of you cupcakes

10:07.924 --> 10:11.227
catch a sunburn before
you're done digging that hole.

10:15.232 --> 10:17.166
Don't worry,
Mr. District Attorney.

10:17.234 --> 10:19.201
If she's down there,
we'll find her.

10:19.269 --> 10:22.371
I have every confidence,
Sheriff Guillory.

10:22.439 --> 10:27.510
So these people that come
to you, tell you things,

10:27.577 --> 10:30.513
like where this girl
is supposedly buried--

10:30.547 --> 10:32.348
they're all...?

10:32.416 --> 10:33.983
Dead. Yeah.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.551
Huh.

10:37.321 --> 10:40.056
That's a handy gift
if it really works.

10:41.158 --> 10:42.224
Hey, Sheriff Guillory!

10:42.292 --> 10:44.293
I think we've got something!

10:45.862 --> 10:47.630
Well, at first glance,

10:47.698 --> 10:49.465
she would certainly seem
to match the description

10:49.533 --> 10:51.167
of the missing young lady.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.870
I am impressed.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.273
Now, you have any clues

10:57.341 --> 10:59.008
about who might
have done this?

10:59.076 --> 11:00.943
No. I'm sorry.

11:03.380 --> 11:06.182
Well, I guess that's my job.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.684
But if you have
any more chatty visitors

11:08.752 --> 11:11.087
from the other side,
you give me a call, okay?

11:11.154 --> 11:12.288
Of course.

11:12.356 --> 11:13.422
Ma'am.

11:13.490 --> 11:14.590
Mr. District Attorney.

11:14.658 --> 11:16.225
Sheriff.

11:16.293 --> 11:17.593
All right, let's finish the job.

11:17.661 --> 11:20.463
Let's get her out of there.

11:23.834 --> 11:25.201
Wow, I didn't even know

11:25.268 --> 11:27.169
that there were
chain gangs anymore.

11:27.237 --> 11:29.105
Ah. That's 'cause
you haven't spent

11:29.172 --> 11:31.040
any time in
Yucca County.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.808
Around here, you're
convicted of a crime,

11:32.876 --> 11:35.044
Sheriff Guillory fits
you for a pink jumpsuit

11:35.112 --> 11:37.046
and assigns you
to a work crew.

11:37.114 --> 11:40.816
The ACLU hates him, but
the voters love him.

11:43.887 --> 11:46.288
This whole experience
was so unexpected.

11:46.356 --> 11:48.691
I mean, on one hand,
you look at him,

11:48.759 --> 11:52.094
and he seems so awful and cruel.

11:52.162 --> 11:53.963
Having prisoners wear
those pink jumpsuits

11:54.030 --> 11:55.631
and parade around
on a chain gang.

11:55.699 --> 11:59.935
Well, remind me never to get
a speeding ticket in Yucca.

12:01.371 --> 12:04.173
Yeah, but on the other hand,
he was very deferential to me,

12:04.241 --> 12:07.109
like he was really impressed
that I came through for him.

12:07.177 --> 12:08.911
I'm very happy
for you.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.714
Well, he's got his work
cut out for him now

12:11.782 --> 12:13.783
figuring out
who killed this girl.

12:13.850 --> 12:15.651
I mean, come on.

12:15.719 --> 12:17.820
She told me everything
about where she was buried.

12:17.888 --> 12:19.855
Couldn't she just take
a few extra seconds

12:19.923 --> 12:21.557
and tell me
who did this to her?

12:21.625 --> 12:24.493
Life is full
of mysteries.

12:24.561 --> 12:27.596
So, apparently,
is death.

12:32.469 --> 12:34.737
Hey.

12:34.805 --> 12:38.207
Did you notice how nice

12:38.275 --> 12:41.210
Ariel and Marie were
to each other tonight?

12:41.244 --> 12:43.145
I think they're really going
to miss each other.

12:44.614 --> 12:46.315
I just wish
that Ariel and Bridgette

12:46.383 --> 12:49.185
had that kind
of relationship.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.527
Joe?

13:00.530 --> 13:02.598
Joe.

13:10.273 --> 13:13.108
I love you, too.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.825
Wow.

13:29.926 --> 13:32.294
Nice.

13:32.362 --> 13:36.398
Who did you have to call
to get us in here?

13:36.466 --> 13:39.768
You know, when, uh,
you said "a room,"

13:39.836 --> 13:42.771
I figured you meant hotel room.

13:44.374 --> 13:46.976
It smells like urine in here.

13:48.612 --> 13:49.845
Whatever.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.448
Still going to cost $100.

13:52.516 --> 13:53.983
It's okay.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.918
I'm good for it.

13:55.986 --> 13:58.320
Sorry.

13:58.388 --> 14:00.689
Nobody's that good.

14:00.757 --> 14:04.727
If you want to play,
you got to pay.

14:04.794 --> 14:06.962
Well, then, we got
a problem, 'cause...

14:07.030 --> 14:09.865
I don't have
any money on me.

14:09.933 --> 14:13.302
No. Actually, you got a problem.

14:13.370 --> 14:15.938
I'm out of here.

14:16.006 --> 14:17.273
Okay. Look...

14:17.340 --> 14:18.674
No, you look.

14:20.577 --> 14:23.078
We came here to do something,
and we're going to do it.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.102
Paul Scanlon.

14:32.154 --> 14:34.121
I swear I've seen
his face before.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.761
Well, you might have seen
him on the news.

14:37.414 --> 14:39.682
He was murdered a year ago.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.417
Beaten to death by a woman.

14:43.387 --> 14:45.321
Given this fella's history,

14:45.389 --> 14:47.823
it sounds like some sort
of poetic justice.

14:47.891 --> 14:51.093
Yeah, a lot of people
thought so at the time.

14:51.161 --> 14:53.162
So, what do we do now?

14:54.731 --> 14:57.967
Well, we don't do much.

14:58.035 --> 15:00.503
Unfortunately,
you're not in my employ.

15:00.570 --> 15:02.538
A fact I'm growing
to regret

15:02.606 --> 15:04.807
more and more
by the second.

15:04.875 --> 15:07.076
Anyway, to answer your question,

15:07.144 --> 15:09.111
her parents deserve
some closure,

15:09.179 --> 15:11.614
so I'm going to see
if I can figure out

15:11.681 --> 15:13.616
just where the hell
this bathroom is,

15:13.683 --> 15:17.420
maybe find a way to put this
Scanlon fella in there with her.

15:17.487 --> 15:21.757
You know, I... I didn't
actually see the murder.

15:21.825 --> 15:25.761
But, in your dream, she was
wearing the same clothes.

15:27.431 --> 15:29.665
Ah, sort of makes sense.

15:29.733 --> 15:32.301
Still the best lead we got.

15:32.369 --> 15:34.270
You met her folks?

15:36.339 --> 15:38.841
Nice people.

15:38.909 --> 15:40.709
Probably not going to mention

15:40.777 --> 15:42.878
the prostitution part
of the story.

15:44.214 --> 15:46.515
He wasn't going
to pay her anyway,

15:46.583 --> 15:50.453
so it sort of seems
beside the point.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.455
Besides, it's tough enough

15:52.522 --> 15:55.124
for a parent
to bury an 18-year old.

15:55.192 --> 15:57.493
They don't need
to know the rest of it.

15:59.863 --> 16:01.797
Well...

16:03.166 --> 16:04.600
I'll call you when
I know something.

16:04.668 --> 16:06.068
I'll call you
if I dream something.

16:06.136 --> 16:07.403
Deal.

16:08.872 --> 16:10.139
Thanks.

16:10.207 --> 16:11.574
Yep.

16:15.112 --> 16:16.579
ARIEL
Hey, Marie!

16:16.646 --> 16:19.615
Over here. Over here.

16:19.683 --> 16:22.451
Hey, what are you doing
inside the computer?

16:22.519 --> 16:24.120
I'm not inside
the computer, silly.

16:24.187 --> 16:25.654
I'm on my laptop.

16:25.722 --> 16:27.089
I'm just trying to show you

16:27.157 --> 16:28.858
that even though I'm going
to college

16:28.925 --> 16:30.392
on the other side
of the country,

16:30.460 --> 16:32.962
we can still see each other
every day, just like this.

16:33.029 --> 16:34.263
Wow. That's amazing.

16:34.331 --> 16:35.498
Where are you?

16:35.565 --> 16:37.500
In my room.

16:37.567 --> 16:39.735
You mean in <i>my</i> room.

16:39.803 --> 16:41.437
It's not your room yet, Bridge.

16:41.505 --> 16:43.172
No, but it will be
soon enough.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.407
Okay, you know,
what's your problem?

16:45.475 --> 16:46.876
I don't have a problem.

16:46.943 --> 16:49.345
I just think it's funny
that you think talking

16:49.412 --> 16:51.080
to your sister
through a computer

16:51.148 --> 16:53.749
is going to make her feel better
about you going away.

16:53.817 --> 16:55.618
Well, it kind of does.

16:55.685 --> 16:57.553
No, it doesn't.

17:01.791 --> 17:04.226
Okay, I asked you before,
and I'm going to ask you again--

17:04.294 --> 17:05.594
what is your problem?

17:05.662 --> 17:07.163
I don't have a problem.

17:07.230 --> 17:08.864
Well, you sure act
like you do.

17:08.932 --> 17:11.066
No. I think
what's throwing you off

17:11.134 --> 17:13.335
is that everybody else
around here is acting

17:13.403 --> 17:14.904
like it's the
end of the world

17:14.971 --> 17:16.438
just 'cause you're
going away.

17:16.506 --> 17:21.510
Me? I just want you to be gone
so that my life can begin.

17:21.578 --> 17:24.180
That's really mean, Bridge.

17:24.247 --> 17:25.614
I don't mean it to be mean.

17:25.682 --> 17:26.915
I mean it to be honest.

17:26.983 --> 17:28.483
I don't care
that you're going away.

17:28.551 --> 17:30.119
I care that I get your room.

17:30.187 --> 17:33.022
I care that the bathroom drawers
will have less junk in them.

17:33.089 --> 17:34.924
That you're not going
to be here?

17:34.991 --> 17:36.992
Sorry. Don't really care.

17:38.028 --> 17:39.328
Think about it.

17:39.396 --> 17:40.829
We don't do anything together.

17:40.897 --> 17:43.165
You don't talk to me,
and when you're not ignoring me,

17:43.233 --> 17:44.266
you're looking at me funny.

17:44.334 --> 17:45.734
What is there to miss?

17:46.770 --> 17:48.370
Fine.

17:48.438 --> 17:50.306
I'll miss you, Ariel.

17:50.373 --> 17:52.408
I know.

17:56.413 --> 17:58.981
I'm going to go
finish packing.

18:14.030 --> 18:16.832
So my brother's a
murderer now, huh?

18:18.768 --> 18:21.237
I just got off the phone
with a deputy from Yucca County.

18:21.304 --> 18:24.173
Wanted to know if I had any of
my brother's personal effects,

18:24.241 --> 18:26.075
if I knew anything
that might connect him

18:26.142 --> 18:27.776
to the murder
of Caroline Krueger.

18:29.713 --> 18:31.513
That's it?

18:31.581 --> 18:34.149
You got nothing to say to me?

18:36.353 --> 18:38.254
I had a dream.

18:38.321 --> 18:39.755
I heard that.

18:39.823 --> 18:41.657
You had a dream
about my brother,

18:41.725 --> 18:43.792
and instead of picking up
the phone and calling me,

18:43.860 --> 18:45.060
you drive out to East Nowhere

18:45.128 --> 18:46.629
and tell everything
to Andy of Mayberry.

18:46.696 --> 18:48.631
Thanks. I guess we're
not friends anymore,

18:48.698 --> 18:50.699
but thanks
for the professional courtesy.

18:50.767 --> 18:52.268
You know I'm a detective?

18:52.335 --> 18:54.870
Well, hey. Of course,
I know you're a detective.

18:54.938 --> 18:56.272
And, of course, I know now

18:56.339 --> 18:57.973
that you would want
to check this out,

18:58.041 --> 19:00.709
but, honestly, I'm just thinking
about this girl.

19:00.777 --> 19:01.977
I mean, think about everything

19:02.045 --> 19:03.312
that's been going on
around here.

19:03.380 --> 19:04.713
With you, with us.

19:04.781 --> 19:06.615
No, no. I get it.

19:06.683 --> 19:08.817
I don't like it, but I get it.

19:10.553 --> 19:12.288
You think my brother's
a murderer.

19:14.858 --> 19:15.791
Of course, you do.

19:15.859 --> 19:17.293
How could I forget?

19:17.360 --> 19:19.128
Look at what you think of me.

19:25.268 --> 19:26.902
<i>Hey, my sister called.</i>

19:26.970 --> 19:28.003
She said everything's a go

19:28.071 --> 19:29.638
for her to pick up
Bridgette and Marie

19:29.706 --> 19:31.407
before we go to the, um...
the airport.

19:33.076 --> 19:36.011
And, um, she said, if we
wanted to stay for a couple

19:36.079 --> 19:39.848
of extra days in New Hampshire,
she's happy to hang with them.

19:39.916 --> 19:41.650
Are you listening to me?

19:41.718 --> 19:43.552
Who you expecting
a message from?

19:43.620 --> 19:45.721
Oh... nobody.

19:45.789 --> 19:46.989
Lee.

19:47.057 --> 19:49.358
Lee? I thought you
weren't speaking to Lee.

19:49.426 --> 19:50.926
Well, I-I'm not.

19:50.994 --> 19:52.328
Or I wasn't.

19:52.395 --> 19:53.996
Only now he's not speaking
to me.

19:54.064 --> 19:56.699
And I don't know why--
it bothers me.

19:56.766 --> 19:58.200
Ah, the worm turns.

19:58.268 --> 20:01.170
Excuse me-- who's the worm
in your version of the story?

20:01.237 --> 20:02.638
Don't ask me.

20:02.706 --> 20:05.607
I'm not the one checking my
cell phone every 30 seconds

20:05.675 --> 20:09.345
to see if the person I'm
not speaking to has called.

20:09.412 --> 20:11.880
Well, I guess
I'm the worm.

20:11.948 --> 20:13.682
I mean, I should
have called him.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.818
I should have told him
what was going on.

20:15.885 --> 20:17.453
I really had
no reason not to.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.755
Well listen, Wormy.

20:19.823 --> 20:22.458
The good news is,
tomorrow is another day.

20:23.927 --> 20:25.561
What do you say
we get some rest?

20:25.628 --> 20:26.929
Hey, how sure are you

20:26.996 --> 20:28.797
about that "tomorrow
is another day" thing?

20:28.865 --> 20:30.866
I have it on
good authority.

20:30.934 --> 20:34.303
Besides, if I'm wrong,
we'll never know.

20:42.379 --> 20:44.546
What are you doing?

20:44.614 --> 20:46.949
We're done, right?

20:49.319 --> 20:51.620
I thought you were done.

20:53.757 --> 20:55.424
I need to go.

20:55.492 --> 20:57.526
I really do. I need to go.

20:57.594 --> 20:59.728
People are going to miss me.

21:01.698 --> 21:03.799
We're not done.

21:05.535 --> 21:08.637
Oh, God, please.

21:08.705 --> 21:11.540
I hurt.

21:11.608 --> 21:13.175
I hurt so bad.

21:13.243 --> 21:15.744
And I need to go, please.

21:15.812 --> 21:17.146
I won't tell
anybody about this.

21:17.213 --> 21:18.547
I promise.

21:19.783 --> 21:21.583
Just, please, I need to go.

21:22.886 --> 21:24.219
What is that?

21:25.622 --> 21:26.889
Is someone coming?

21:26.956 --> 21:28.223
Shut up.

21:28.291 --> 21:29.925
You make one sound,
and I'll kill you.

21:29.993 --> 21:32.261
You understand me?

22:02.926 --> 22:06.094
Well, hello there, Mr. Good.

22:24.516 --> 22:25.883
So when did you find out

22:25.951 --> 22:28.553
your brother was back
in Phoenix?

22:29.822 --> 22:31.989
Is this what you not
talking to me looks like?

22:32.057 --> 22:34.258
'Cause I'm starting to think you
don't understand the concept.

22:35.294 --> 22:37.028
Come on. You know
as well as I do.

22:37.096 --> 22:38.429
Couple of days
before he died.

22:38.497 --> 22:39.931
Devalos pulled me
into his office.

22:40.423 --> 22:42.224
You're lying.
You're lying to me.

22:42.292 --> 22:44.026
You've been lying to me
this whole time.

22:44.093 --> 22:46.295
You knew he was back
months before that,

22:46.362 --> 22:47.696
because you were with him

22:47.764 --> 22:49.565
the night that he murdered
Caroline Krueger.

22:49.632 --> 22:51.433
You're crazy.

22:51.501 --> 22:52.634
Come on, Lee.

22:52.702 --> 22:53.802
Come with me.

22:53.870 --> 22:56.371
We have to talk to Sheriff
Guillory about this.

22:56.439 --> 22:59.441
You have to tell him that you
know where that restroom is.

22:59.509 --> 23:01.543
You have to tell him
that you can place

23:01.611 --> 23:04.112
your brother there the
night of the murder.

23:04.180 --> 23:05.614
Lee, come on.

23:05.682 --> 23:07.349
This girl's family
deserves it.

23:07.417 --> 23:09.017
Her family deserves
to know the truth.

23:09.085 --> 23:10.686
You're out of your mind!

23:10.753 --> 23:13.188
Hey, I saw you there!

23:13.256 --> 23:14.423
You saw me where?

23:14.490 --> 23:15.757
In some desert restroom

23:15.825 --> 23:17.626
where you say my brother
killed some woman?

23:17.694 --> 23:20.095
I don't think so, 'cause
if I was, I wouldn't have had

23:20.163 --> 23:22.197
to spend last night
crawling around every toilet

23:22.265 --> 23:23.832
within spitting distance
of the 18.

23:23.900 --> 23:26.301
So, last night, you're looking
for where this girl died?

23:26.369 --> 23:27.703
I'm a detective, Allison.

23:27.770 --> 23:29.338
My brother's being accused
of murder.

23:29.405 --> 23:31.273
I think he's probably
the lowest form of life,

23:31.341 --> 23:32.708
but I don't think
he's a murderer.

23:32.775 --> 23:35.544
So, yeah, last night,
I went on a tour of toilets.

23:35.612 --> 23:37.813
And did you find anything?

23:37.881 --> 23:39.848
This is Marist Park in Yucca.

23:39.916 --> 23:41.183
This is the restroom

23:41.251 --> 23:42.351
nearest the entrance.

23:42.418 --> 23:43.652
Do you think that's
where it happened?

23:43.720 --> 23:47.289
You told Guillory you saw tags
on all the walls, right?

23:47.357 --> 23:49.992
"Raggz" with two Gs
and a Z.

23:50.059 --> 23:52.427
Well, turns out there's
a branch of the Raggz gang

23:52.495 --> 23:54.496
that does operate
on the outskirts of Yucca.

23:54.564 --> 23:56.231
And guess what.

23:56.299 --> 23:58.700
Marist Park is part
of their territory.

23:58.768 --> 24:03.739
So, I started looking last night
after my shift was over,

24:03.806 --> 24:08.210
and I did find one restroom
I think is a maybe.

24:08.278 --> 24:10.245
Now, is it the restroom
you dreamt about?

24:10.313 --> 24:11.914
I have no idea.

24:11.981 --> 24:15.484
<i>But I did walk inside,</i>
<i>and I just had a feeling.</i>

24:15.551 --> 24:17.920
<i>It's a detective thing.</i>

24:22.058 --> 24:23.425
<i>And, I mean, I know the place</i>

24:23.493 --> 24:25.160
<i>must have been cleaned</i>
<i>a hundred times</i>

24:25.228 --> 24:27.663
<i>since the night</i>
<i>Caroline Krueger disappeared.</i>

24:27.730 --> 24:30.165
<i>I know the odds</i>
<i>of finding any evidence</i>

24:30.233 --> 24:33.602
<i>that a crime took place</i>
<i>in there are virtually nil.</i>

24:33.670 --> 24:36.772
<i>I was just about to leave...</i>

24:36.839 --> 24:39.408
<i>when I heard something.</i>

24:39.475 --> 24:41.410
<i>They got one of those</i>
<i>new lights in there</i>

24:41.477 --> 24:43.512
<i>with those, uh, environmentally</i>
<i>friendly lightbulbs.</i>

24:43.579 --> 24:45.814
<i>They last about a hundred</i>
<i>years, but, uh,</i>

24:45.882 --> 24:47.783
<i>they make a buzzing sound</i>
<i>like a...</i>

24:47.850 --> 24:50.419
<i>a bee that's had</i>
<i>too much coffee to drink.</i>

24:50.486 --> 24:52.321
<i>And that's when it hits me.</i>

24:52.388 --> 24:54.723
They don't clean
lightbulbs, Allison.

24:54.791 --> 24:56.591
So maybe...

24:56.659 --> 24:58.360
just maybe ...

24:58.428 --> 25:00.829
if the killing did happen
in this particular bathroom,

25:00.897 --> 25:03.165
and if it was violent enough,

25:03.232 --> 25:05.801
and if, in fact,
this is a bulb that was in there

25:05.868 --> 25:08.403
when this supposed killing
happened,

25:08.471 --> 25:11.974
there may just be some blood
or some DNA or something on it.

25:12.041 --> 25:15.077
The girl's, and hopefully
somebody other than my brother.

25:15.144 --> 25:17.045
Well, so where's the bulb now?

25:17.113 --> 25:18.380
Are you having it tested?

25:18.448 --> 25:19.448
Couldn't get to it.

25:19.515 --> 25:21.083
They got an aluminum box
over it.

25:21.150 --> 25:23.085
You need a key to get it off.

25:23.152 --> 25:25.454
I was going to call
your new friend, Deputy Dog,

25:25.521 --> 25:27.022
and ask him if he
could meet me

25:27.090 --> 25:28.423
over there
to help me unlock it.

25:28.491 --> 25:31.226
I was even going to suggest
we bring the bulb back here,

25:31.294 --> 25:34.563
let the city's forensic lab
run the DNA analysis.

25:34.630 --> 25:36.999
Assuming there is some DNA.

25:37.066 --> 25:39.034
Assuming we have the right bulb.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.869
Assuming we have
the right bathroom.

25:40.937 --> 25:42.804
You get the idea.

25:44.273 --> 25:46.274
Well, you want me to call him?

25:46.342 --> 25:48.176
What, now you're
my friend again?

25:50.213 --> 25:52.781
I know how to dial a phone.

25:52.849 --> 25:54.616
Feel free to call your buddy
Guillory tomorrow.

25:54.684 --> 25:56.385
Ask him about all the fun we had

25:56.452 --> 25:58.587
at the, uh, restroom
in Marist Park.

25:58.654 --> 26:02.224
After that,
I don't really care what you do.

26:21.978 --> 26:23.845
What you doing?

26:25.715 --> 26:27.616
I don't know.

26:27.683 --> 26:30.852
Just looking at my ceiling
one last time.

26:38.094 --> 26:40.862
You excited about tomorrow?

26:41.898 --> 26:44.199
Excited.

26:44.267 --> 26:46.201
Scared.

26:46.269 --> 26:47.803
But excited.

26:49.639 --> 26:53.809
How about your good-bye
to Marie and Bridgette?

26:53.876 --> 26:55.710
Oh, yeah.

26:55.778 --> 26:57.712
Took Marie out for ice cream.

26:57.780 --> 26:59.714
Showed her how
to use the computer again

26:59.782 --> 27:01.516
so we can video-chat.

27:01.584 --> 27:04.619
Gave her that backpack
I had in middle school--

27:04.687 --> 27:07.155
the one
that she's always wanted.

27:08.357 --> 27:10.358
And Bridgette?

27:17.400 --> 27:19.134
I don't know.

27:19.202 --> 27:23.505
She waved when I took Marie
out for ice cream.

27:23.573 --> 27:26.508
Asked me to bring back
a sweatshirt from Dartmouth.

27:28.077 --> 27:29.945
I don't understand.

27:30.012 --> 27:31.546
I guess she
was right.

27:31.614 --> 27:34.716
I guess we never really
were that close.

27:34.784 --> 27:36.184
Hey.

27:36.252 --> 27:38.320
But you're sisters.

27:38.387 --> 27:42.324
But I can't make her
miss me, Mom.

27:42.391 --> 27:45.293
She doesn't want
to give me a hug.

27:45.361 --> 27:47.762
She doesn't want a big good-bye.

27:47.830 --> 27:50.432
All she wants is this room.

27:51.767 --> 27:54.269
So I guess that's the least
that I can give her.

27:54.337 --> 27:56.771
You know, I've been thinking
about that.

27:56.839 --> 27:59.074
You don't have to move out
of here.

27:59.142 --> 28:01.343
I mean, this is still
your family.

28:01.410 --> 28:03.011
You're going to need
somewhere to stay

28:03.079 --> 28:06.815
when you come back on breaks
and vacations and...

28:07.850 --> 28:08.950
No.

28:09.018 --> 28:11.820
She really wants this room.

28:11.888 --> 28:13.822
Well, and I'll, uh...

28:13.890 --> 28:17.292
I'll sleep with Marie in
the bunk beds when I come home.

28:20.863 --> 28:23.298
You know what's funny?

28:25.301 --> 28:28.069
I think I'm going to miss her.

28:31.541 --> 28:33.475
Oh, babe.

28:34.610 --> 28:37.879
<i>92, 93...</i>

28:37.947 --> 28:40.315
And if you do this
a hundred times every night,

28:40.383 --> 28:43.652
your hair will never tangle,
and it will always shine.

28:43.719 --> 28:45.520
A whole hundred?

28:45.588 --> 28:48.323
A whole hundred.

28:48.391 --> 28:50.225
Will it shine
like yours?

28:50.293 --> 28:51.393
Mm-hmm.

28:51.460 --> 28:52.894
Cool.

28:54.864 --> 28:56.865
JOE'S DAD:
You forgot about
that, didn't you?

28:58.801 --> 29:01.903
You taught her
about brushing her hair.

29:01.971 --> 29:04.239
About carrying numbers over
in long division.

29:04.307 --> 29:06.208
About all kinds of things.

29:07.877 --> 29:09.678
What are you doing here?

29:09.745 --> 29:12.480
And are you the reason
I just had that dream?

29:12.548 --> 29:14.015
Like I told you,

29:14.083 --> 29:16.218
I am very worried
about your sister.

29:16.285 --> 29:17.619
'Cause I don't think
you appreciate

29:17.687 --> 29:19.221
how much she depends on you

29:19.288 --> 29:23.058
and how much she is going
to miss you when you're gone.

29:23.125 --> 29:25.994
Wait, the other day
when you were here,

29:26.062 --> 29:28.663
you were talking
about Bridgette?

29:37.740 --> 29:40.875
Well, hello there, Mr. Good.

30:06.969 --> 30:08.570
He's here.

30:08.638 --> 30:10.605
Just like you said
he would be.

30:10.673 --> 30:11.806
Yeah.

30:11.874 --> 30:13.708
He may be
a lousy brother,

30:13.776 --> 30:16.177
but he's always
been a good cop.

30:16.245 --> 30:20.181
A good cop
and a great detective.

30:21.651 --> 30:23.652
Come on, Sherlock.

30:23.719 --> 30:25.520
A crime
has been committed.

30:25.588 --> 30:27.789
You can solve it.

30:27.857 --> 30:30.325
Think, baby brother.

30:30.393 --> 30:31.860
Think, think, think,
think, think,

30:31.927 --> 30:33.962
think, think.
Come on.

30:35.131 --> 30:37.232
Ah. Yeah.

30:37.300 --> 30:40.068
You're getting warmer,
baby brother.

30:40.136 --> 30:43.238
Oh, yeah.
Yes, you are.

30:43.306 --> 30:45.440
Like a moth
to the flames.

30:45.508 --> 30:46.775
Oh, yeah.

30:46.842 --> 30:48.543
You're on fire,
Mr. Good.

30:48.611 --> 30:50.578
You're on fire, baby.

30:52.481 --> 30:53.982
Pretty good, huh?

30:54.050 --> 30:57.118
We had you completely fooled,
didn't we?

31:08.931 --> 31:10.932
You looking for me?

31:12.501 --> 31:14.269
Lee was telling the truth,
wasn't he?

31:14.337 --> 31:16.237
He'd never been in that bathroom
before last night.

31:16.305 --> 31:18.106
And even though
the two of you were there,

31:18.174 --> 31:20.175
he couldn't see you
because the two of you are...

31:20.242 --> 31:21.843
Sleeping the big sleep.

31:23.279 --> 31:24.579
Look at that.

31:24.647 --> 31:26.314
You got it all
figured out.

31:26.382 --> 31:29.851
You thought you were
looking at the past,

31:29.919 --> 31:31.953
but you were really looking
at the present.

31:32.021 --> 31:33.355
Yeah.

31:33.422 --> 31:37.092
That was just a little play
that Caroline and me put on.

31:37.159 --> 31:39.928
Staged for an audience of one.

31:39.995 --> 31:41.563
I-I don't get it.

31:41.630 --> 31:44.232
Why would you want me to think
that Lee was with you

31:44.300 --> 31:45.800
the night that you
killed Caroline?

31:45.868 --> 31:48.970
And why would Caroline help you
after all you've done to her?

31:49.038 --> 31:50.739
Good question.

31:50.806 --> 31:52.741
Why would Caroline help me

31:52.808 --> 31:55.143
after I beat her to death
ten months ago?

31:55.211 --> 31:57.011
Unless...

31:58.214 --> 31:59.814
You didn't do it, did you?

32:01.617 --> 32:05.186
I didn't even meet her till we
were both on the other side.

32:05.254 --> 32:09.157
That's when I found out
about people like you.

32:10.192 --> 32:11.960
People who
could see me.

32:12.027 --> 32:16.331
People who could see
what I wanted them to see.

32:17.433 --> 32:20.135
If you didn't do it,
then who did?

32:20.202 --> 32:22.404
And why did you go
to all this trouble

32:22.471 --> 32:24.172
to make me think it was you?

32:25.574 --> 32:28.643
Well, maybe I knew that it
would only be a matter of time

32:28.711 --> 32:31.212
before it got back to Lee,

32:31.280 --> 32:33.748
and maybe I knew
that if he thought

32:33.816 --> 32:35.316
I was involved in a murder,

32:35.384 --> 32:38.153
there's no way he'd just be
able to sit on the sidelines.

32:38.220 --> 32:39.554
Uh-uh, no.

32:39.622 --> 32:42.190
He'd find that toilet
you'd been dreaming about,

32:42.258 --> 32:43.792
he'd go there, and
he'd figure out

32:43.859 --> 32:47.929
the one thing that
might clear me,

32:47.997 --> 32:49.731
and then he'd bring
it to the attention

32:49.799 --> 32:53.735
of the man who really killed
that poor little whore.

32:54.770 --> 32:56.905
Sheriff Guillory?

32:56.972 --> 32:59.140
You know, it's tough being
a strict law and order man,

32:59.208 --> 33:00.241
it really is.

33:00.309 --> 33:02.076
I mean, every once in
a while, you got to,

33:02.144 --> 33:04.279
you know, blow off
a little steam,

33:04.346 --> 33:05.947
so when the good
sheriff picked up

33:06.015 --> 33:08.283
that little girl on
a solicitation charge

33:08.350 --> 33:12.520
and she offered him a
freebie to let her go,

33:12.588 --> 33:15.423
well, he took her to the
most out-of-the-way place

33:15.491 --> 33:17.659
he could think of.

33:17.726 --> 33:21.763
Problem is... Sheriff
likes it rough.

33:22.798 --> 33:24.933
Caroline fought back.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.237
Lot of blood when all
was said and done.

33:29.305 --> 33:32.407
Now, the sheriff cleaned
up the best he could,

33:32.475 --> 33:35.410
but he forgot one
little detail.

33:35.478 --> 33:37.212
The lightbulb.

33:37.279 --> 33:39.481
The same one my baby brother
is pointing out to him

33:39.548 --> 33:41.249
right this very moment.

33:41.317 --> 33:42.484
Oh, my God,
he's going to kill him.

33:42.551 --> 33:44.786
Yeah, we can
only hope so.

33:46.856 --> 33:49.357
You've reached the cell phone
of Detective Lee Scanlon.

33:49.425 --> 33:51.025
Leave a message after the beep.

33:51.093 --> 33:53.161
Lee, this is Allison,
this is an emergency.

33:53.229 --> 33:54.662
Call me back.

33:54.730 --> 33:55.697
Voice mail, huh?

33:56.765 --> 33:57.765
Not a good sign.

33:57.833 --> 33:59.467
Hope Caroline
won't be too upset

33:59.535 --> 34:03.037
if the sheriff gets
the drop on ol' Lee.

34:03.105 --> 34:06.841
She's obviously rooting
for things to go the other way.

34:06.909 --> 34:08.743
Of course, I kind of fibbed
and told her

34:08.811 --> 34:10.612
Lee was quicker on the draw
than the guy

34:10.679 --> 34:12.280
who killed her.

34:12.348 --> 34:13.781
Ah, what am I saying?

34:13.849 --> 34:15.382
I can't fool you.

34:15.451 --> 34:17.418
You know the rules
better than I do.

34:17.485 --> 34:20.355
I'm dead, so I peeked.

34:20.422 --> 34:22.824
I looked into the future
and saw how it all ended,

34:22.891 --> 34:26.226
and let's just say everyone
gets what they want,

34:26.295 --> 34:27.929
all the dead people anyway.

34:27.996 --> 34:29.230
Good idea.

34:29.297 --> 34:30.264
Let's go see
for ourselves

34:30.331 --> 34:31.599
how it all turned out.

34:35.036 --> 34:37.505
Wonder which one of us is going
to make it there first.

35:14.835 --> 35:17.837
♪ ♪

35:22.997 --> 35:26.866
I do believe this is what
you call a win-win, partner.

35:27.862 --> 35:29.564
This scumbag pulled his gun

35:29.572 --> 35:31.507
while your brother's back
was turned.

35:31.574 --> 35:35.978
Of course, your brother here
saw him in the mirror.

35:37.013 --> 35:39.515
Very cool.

35:42.752 --> 35:44.586
Huh.

35:44.654 --> 35:48.590
Sounds like my friend Allison
called in the cavalry.

35:50.326 --> 35:52.728
I guess our work here is done.

35:52.795 --> 35:53.929
Good.

35:53.997 --> 35:57.733
Then I can get gone,
and with any luck,

35:57.800 --> 36:00.836
I'll never have to run
into any of you again.

36:00.904 --> 36:03.405
That's all right,
you can thank me later.

36:05.575 --> 36:09.344
Huh, well...
love you, too, darling.

36:16.819 --> 36:18.820
Hey.

36:18.888 --> 36:20.289
Remember when we were little?

36:20.356 --> 36:23.192
That big hill
behind our house?

36:23.259 --> 36:24.593
All the neighborhood kids
would play

36:24.661 --> 36:25.861
King of the Mountain
there.

36:27.897 --> 36:30.265
Just about every day,

36:30.333 --> 36:34.403
it'd end up with you and me
at the top.

36:35.438 --> 36:38.240
Just about every day...

36:38.308 --> 36:42.110
I'd knock you down to the bottom
with the rest of the losers.

36:43.746 --> 36:47.316
Remember what I used
to tell you?

36:47.383 --> 36:49.851
"You may be Mr. Good."

36:49.919 --> 36:52.521
"But I'll always be Mr. Better."

37:11.574 --> 37:13.408
What do you think, huh?

37:14.811 --> 37:16.745
Pretty in life, pretty in death.

37:16.813 --> 37:19.881
Hell of a feeling, isn't it,

37:19.949 --> 37:24.853
waking up dead, realizing
your own flesh and blood

37:24.921 --> 37:26.054
made it happen?

37:28.157 --> 37:30.325
Now we're even.

37:35.298 --> 37:37.132
Clear!

37:37.200 --> 37:40.035
Get the medic team in.

37:45.174 --> 37:48.810
All right, let's get 'em
to the hospital.

37:48.878 --> 37:50.445
Too bad they can't see you
over here, huh?

37:50.513 --> 37:52.281
Then maybe they'd know
not to bother.

37:53.316 --> 37:55.550
Come on,
Mr. Good.

37:55.618 --> 37:57.953
Don't just
stand there.

37:58.021 --> 37:59.388
I went to a lot of trouble

37:59.455 --> 38:01.623
to arrange
this little face-to-face.

38:01.691 --> 38:03.125
Don't you have
anything to say?

38:03.192 --> 38:04.126
Shh...

38:04.193 --> 38:07.329
Don't shush me, little brother.

38:07.397 --> 38:09.598
I've waited a whole lot
of months to get you alone,

38:09.666 --> 38:10.632
tell you what I think

38:10.700 --> 38:11.833
about you.

38:11.901 --> 38:14.336
Sorry, I'm not really
listening to you.

38:14.404 --> 38:17.139
I'm thinking about my wife.

38:17.206 --> 38:18.840
I'm thinking about my baby.

38:18.908 --> 38:21.576
I'm trying to hold on
to them in my head.

38:21.644 --> 38:22.611
What are you
talking about?

38:22.679 --> 38:24.646
Hold on to them?

38:24.714 --> 38:26.081
There's nothing
they can do for you,

38:26.149 --> 38:28.750
not from here.

38:28.818 --> 38:31.219
I tell you what, you want to...

38:31.287 --> 38:33.822
want to hold on to something?

38:33.890 --> 38:37.459
Hold on to this-- for
the rest of eternity,

38:37.527 --> 38:40.529
you get to watch your wife
cry herself to sleep.

38:40.596 --> 38:42.531
You like that, huh?

38:42.598 --> 38:45.467
Yeah, and how about
hold on to this, too?

38:45.535 --> 38:48.537
For the rest of her life,
you get to watch your kid

38:48.604 --> 38:51.540
grow up without her daddy.

38:51.607 --> 38:55.477
Enjoy, Mr. Good,
my gift to you.

38:57.880 --> 38:59.681
What are you grinning about?

38:59.749 --> 39:03.352
What's so
funny, huh?

39:03.419 --> 39:08.090
Want to let me in on the,
on the joke, baby brother?

39:08.157 --> 39:11.193
It's a funny thing, this dying.

39:11.260 --> 39:13.929
Suddenly you see a lot more
than you could before.

39:18.067 --> 39:20.869
I just saw something, Paul.

39:20.937 --> 39:22.637
I know something you don't.

39:22.705 --> 39:23.638
Clear!

39:26.209 --> 39:28.410
He's got a pulse--
weak but steady.

39:29.445 --> 39:31.713
No.

39:31.781 --> 39:32.981
No!

39:33.049 --> 39:35.250
No, damn it, this isn't fair!

39:35.318 --> 39:36.585
Now, this man is dead!

39:36.652 --> 39:39.321
He deserves
to be dead!

39:39.389 --> 39:41.456
What are you doing?!
Stop giving him oxygen, huh?!

39:41.524 --> 39:42.657
Let him bleed to death!

39:42.725 --> 39:44.025
What are you doing?!

39:44.093 --> 39:45.327
Let him die!

39:45.395 --> 39:46.328
You want to save somebody?!

39:46.396 --> 39:48.263
Go save
that crooked sheriff, huh?!

39:48.331 --> 39:50.565
This isn't
how it's supposed to be!

40:03.112 --> 40:05.046
Miss, you can't
come through here.

40:05.114 --> 40:07.182
I'm looking
for Lee Scanlon.

40:07.250 --> 40:10.018
Detective Scanlon.

40:10.086 --> 40:12.154
Lee!

40:12.221 --> 40:13.255
Lee...

40:13.322 --> 40:16.591
Lee... n-n-n-no, don't...

40:16.659 --> 40:18.493
I'm gonna call Ly-Lynn.

40:18.561 --> 40:20.562
We'll, we'll meet you
at the hospital, okay?

40:20.630 --> 40:24.633
Lee, I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry.

40:24.700 --> 40:27.636
I see things and I know things,

40:27.703 --> 40:30.305
but I guess sometimes I'm wrong

40:30.373 --> 40:33.008
and I was wrong about you.

40:52.562 --> 40:54.229
Hey.

40:54.297 --> 40:56.064
Don't speak.

40:56.132 --> 40:57.666
Just listen.

40:57.733 --> 41:01.503
I put all my posters
back up on the walls in my room.

41:01.571 --> 41:03.572
I put all the things
I'm not taking with me

41:03.639 --> 41:05.240
back in my drawers

41:05.308 --> 41:09.444
because I realized that
that is my room, not yours,

41:09.512 --> 41:12.314
and that I am still
a part of this family

41:12.381 --> 41:15.450
and I still need a place
to sleep when I come back.

41:15.518 --> 41:19.621
But you can sleep in there
whenever you want,

41:19.689 --> 41:21.323
but when you do,

41:21.390 --> 41:23.091
I want you to think,

41:23.159 --> 41:26.194
"I am sleeping
in my older sister's room,

41:26.262 --> 41:30.232
"and she is out there
in the world learning things

41:30.299 --> 41:32.267
"so that she can come back here

41:32.335 --> 41:35.737
and give me a heads up
before it's my turn."

41:36.973 --> 41:40.976
And you can pretend
that you don't care about me.

41:42.011 --> 41:44.846
But I care about you

41:44.914 --> 41:47.582
and I have taught you
lots of things

41:47.650 --> 41:51.319
and we have done
lots of stuff together,

41:51.387 --> 41:53.388
but I plan to do more.

41:54.590 --> 41:57.893
So I wrote this up for you.

41:57.960 --> 42:01.363
It's instructions
on how to video-chat with me

42:01.430 --> 42:03.064
while I'm in college,

42:03.132 --> 42:05.367
because I know that you want to

42:05.434 --> 42:08.270
but you're too proud
to ask Marie how to do it.

42:11.407 --> 42:15.210
So, anyway, in a few minutes
Dad is going to come in here

42:15.278 --> 42:17.579
and he's going
to wake everybody up

42:17.647 --> 42:19.180
and you can go back
to pretending

42:19.248 --> 42:21.349
that you don't care
that I'm going,

42:21.417 --> 42:23.752
and that's fine
with me.

42:25.454 --> 42:28.390
But I just want you
to know that I love you...

42:28.457 --> 42:31.993
that you are loved...

42:32.061 --> 42:34.663
and that you will be missed...

42:34.730 --> 42:38.199
and there is not a damn thing
you can do about it.

42:43.306 --> 42:45.507
See you at parents weekend.

42:45.575 --> 42:48.209
Hey, Ariel.

42:50.446 --> 42:52.747
Me, too.

42:52.815 --> 42:54.816
I know.

42:57.820 --> 43:00.322
Girls, got a big day!

43:00.389 --> 43:02.357
Everybody up
and at 'em!
