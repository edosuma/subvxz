Two or the same as.

06:03.074 --> 06:04.658
Just remember that, at least.

06:04.824 --> 06:07.658
So, the full bit is
a low standard deviation indicates

06:07.783 --> 06:11.240
the value must be close to
or the same as...

06:12.532 --> 06:15.032
the mean or expected value.
Got that?

06:15.157 --> 06:18.782

you didn't touch Tracey's boob?

06:22.240 --> 06:24.657
(Tracey) Jesus, Kev!
- Kev, what is wrong with you?

06:24.782 --> 06:27.365
What?
It's true, he didn't, they just said it.

06:27.490 --> 06:29.490
(Kev) It's not my fault
he doesn't like girls.

06:29.615 --> 06:32.657
(Student) I love boobs.
- (Sweeney) All right, yeah, thank you.

06:32.782 --> 06:34.407
So, um, anyway...

06:58.697 --> 07:00.156

07:15.696 --> 07:17.905
(Guy) You perving on us?
- I said 30 minutes.

07:18.030 --> 07:20.155
What can I say?
We had to make it last.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.905
Yeah, I wish.
That place is filthy.

07:23.030 --> 07:25.280
I know,
you should really get a hotel (!)

07:25.405 --> 07:26.821
(Girl) Hm.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.946
Have you thought about
what you're going to do next year?

07:30.071 --> 07:31.321
Fucking lesbian!

07:31.446 --> 07:33.863
(Scoffs) Wha...?

07:34.738 --> 07:37.071
I...I am NOT a lesbian.

07:40.946 --> 07:42.238
(Door closes)

07:44.530 --> 07:45.738
What were those two up to?

07:47.820 --> 07:50.487
Dunno.
- Teen pregnancy waiting to happen.

07:51.529 --> 07:53.154
You had me at 19.

07:53.279 --> 07:55.195
It'd be an ugly bloody baby at that.

07:56.195 --> 07:57.195
I'm going to do...

07:57.320 --> 08:00.279
Remember, boys don't respect girls
that spread their legs.

08:00.445 --> 08:01.695
Mam!

08:04.695 --> 08:06.779
Your dad would be so proud of you.

08:08.945 --> 08:10.737
Do you want to stay home tomorrow?

08:11.404 --> 08:12.945
The school will understand.

08:14.112 --> 08:16.695
We could light a candle
for his anniversary.

08:17.945 --> 08:19.111
It's OK.

08:20.111 --> 08:21.236
Thanks.

08:21.361 --> 08:24.319
(Soft, slow instrumental)

08:25.236 --> 08:27.194
Would you not try a bit of lipstick?

08:27.319 --> 08:30.194
Jesus, mam,
make up your mind!

08:30.319 --> 08:32.403

09:01.777 --> 09:04.110
(Deep exhale)

09:09.610 --> 09:13.360
(Hannah) You've got to be
fucking kidding me. Another six months?

09:13.485 --> 09:16.693
No, you don't have to do it twice,
you applied for that!

09:16.818 --> 09:19.152
(Ian) Hannah, I...- (Hannah) Just open the door.

09:33.942 --> 09:35.984
Ready for the first fitness test?
- Mm-hm.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.484
Great.
Can you, um...do a chin-up yet?

09:39.609 --> 09:40.692
Ian.
- What?

09:40.817 --> 09:43.442
There's more to life than chin-ups.
- Not in the Cadets.

09:44.776 --> 09:47.442
Uh... Eddie shifted a girl today.

09:49.734 --> 09:50.734
Oh.

09:51.109 --> 09:53.401
Word is he didn't touch her tits.
- Jack!

09:53.526 --> 09:56.400
Who said that?
- A few people like, you know...

09:56.525 --> 09:58.983
A few people in every class,
like everyone...

09:59.108 --> 10:01.191
Everyone said it.
- Look. Sh. It's fine.

10:01.316 --> 10:03.566
That's all right,
that's respectful, right?

10:03.691 --> 10:06.066
No, no, I didn't have time!
The bell rang!

10:06.191 --> 10:08.858
I was literally about to grab it.
- Jesus!

10:09.400 --> 10:10.775
Is she your girlfriend?

10:12.525 --> 10:14.691
W-We don't want to put a label on it.

10:15.441 --> 10:17.233
But, yes.
- Good.

10:18.441 --> 10:20.400
That's good,
you're becoming a man.

10:21.150 --> 10:23.066
See? I knew
we didn't have to worry.

10:24.525 --> 10:25.983
(Hannah sighs) Jesus, Ian.

10:28.274 --> 10:30.107
(Kev) I just don't know if I can vote.

10:31.024 --> 10:33.107
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

10:37.649 --> 10:39.899
(Quietly) Hey. Hey! Hey...

10:43.482 --> 10:44.649

10:45.857 --> 10:47.690
This place is such a hole.

10:51.774 --> 10:53.065
Hello?

10:59.315 --> 11:02.106
(Kev) Wahey, wanker!
State of him.

11:03.481 --> 11:04.981
Hey, Tracey.

11:06.398 --> 11:08.731
Uh, do you wanna go
to the cinema sometime?

11:09.814 --> 11:11.148
Huh?

11:11.273 --> 11:14.564
Or just like a milkshake.
Maybe?

11:16.523 --> 11:18.356
No? OK. Uh...

11:19.023 --> 11:20.273
Just meet my parents?

11:21.064 --> 11:22.273
Fuck off.

11:22.398 --> 11:23.731
(Quietly) OK.

11:23.856 --> 11:25.689
(Indistinct)

11:25.814 --> 11:27.981
It's fine.
I'm gonna go this way.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.148
(Muttering) OK, OK, OK, OK...

11:34.563 --> 11:35.563
(Guy) Homo!

11:44.772 --> 11:48.647
# Feels like nothing

11:48.772 --> 11:52.480
# And it looks like
you're nothing at all... #

11:52.605 --> 11:53.897
(Eddie groans) Fuck!

11:57.272 --> 12:00.313
Did you throw a rock at me?
- You didn't stop. Anyway...

12:01.147 --> 12:02.230
I'll go out with you.

12:03.772 --> 12:05.896
What?
- On a date!

12:06.771 --> 12:07.812
Wanna go out or not?

12:09.771 --> 12:11.229
(Kev) Benders!

12:11.354 --> 12:12.604
(Laughter)

12:15.021 --> 12:16.146
OK.

fall in love with you and then die.'

(Man) 'Do you think
I wanna leave you, Karen?'

12:40.436 --> 12:43.020
'I love you more than anything,

12:43.145 --> 12:45.811
you and our unborn child.'

12:56.311 --> 12:57.478
(Man) 'Oh, Karen!'

12:57.603 --> 13:00.978

but fuck them,

13:01.145 --> 13:02.645
it's all about Bikini Kill.

13:02.770 --> 13:05.311
Kathleen Hanna is proper punk.

13:05.436 --> 13:06.770
Have you heard them?

13:06.895 --> 13:08.311
Of course not.

13:08.436 --> 13:12.394
And what do you see?
Female bass players, that's it.

13:12.519 --> 13:16.727
So, you think women shouldn't play bass?
- Of course they should be bass players!

13:16.852 --> 13:19.102

Uh, it's, uh...
(Clears his throat)

13:25.977 --> 13:27.477
It's on my list.

13:27.602 --> 13:29.602
(Slurps drink)

13:37.060 --> 13:39.560
So, why do you want to join
the fascist war machine?

13:39.685 --> 13:42.310
What?
- The army.

13:45.059 --> 13:47.143
I believe...
(Clears his throat)

13:48.226 --> 13:52.351
...that the fire of war
turns one into a man.

13:52.476 --> 13:57.393
It's the Irish army. They're more likely
to be filling in for bin men on strike.

13:58.143 --> 13:59.684
What else can I do?

14:00.726 --> 14:02.476
Besides, it's a family tradition.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.059
Was your grandad in the army too?
- No, he was a farmer.

14:07.851 --> 14:10.893
It needs to be more than one person
in order to be a tradition.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.268
Yeah, well,
I'll make it a tradition, then!

14:13.684 --> 14:14.768
Jesus.

14:17.808 --> 14:20.475
(Indistinct hushed voices)

14:20.600 --> 14:22.225
(Girl) She's holding his hand.

14:23.558 --> 14:26.058
(Amber)
Jesus, Ireland's roads are so shit.

14:33.808 --> 14:36.142
Did I give you my condolences
about your dad?

14:37.392 --> 14:40.850
You probably muttered "I'm sorry
for your troubles" at some point.

14:40.975 --> 14:43.517
Good.
That was good of me.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.392
And I'm sorry for your troubles.

14:46.975 --> 14:48.516
You didn't make him do it.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.557
Or did you?

14:53.099 --> 14:55.057
No, no, of course not!

14:55.724 --> 14:58.599
Joking.
- Jesus, Amber.

15:10.724 --> 15:11.891
Thanks.

15:14.974 --> 15:16.224
I had fun.

15:17.599 --> 15:19.307
Really?
- Yeah.

15:21.390 --> 15:22.390
OK.

15:27.473 --> 15:30.890
W-What the hell are you doing?!
- I don't know! I thought that...

15:31.015 --> 15:33.140
You're gay!
- (Stammering) Gay for boobs!

15:33.931 --> 15:36.598
I can see your hard-on
under the desk for Sweeney!

15:36.723 --> 15:38.181
I like his clothes.

15:38.306 --> 15:41.015
One, only a gay guy would say that.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.140
And two, he dresses like shit,

15:43.265 --> 15:46.765
which you would know because
gays have a great sense of fashion.

15:46.890 --> 15:49.223
Well, there you go,
there you go, I'm not gay. So...

15:49.973 --> 15:51.265
Yes, you are.

15:51.390 --> 15:52.722
(Sighs)

15:55.472 --> 15:56.472
So am I.

16:00.055 --> 16:03.805
Aren't you tired
of being called a faggot?

16:04.389 --> 16:05.889
Well, yes, because I'm not one.

16:07.014 --> 16:10.472
We pretend to go out
just to get everyone to leave us alone.

16:11.180 --> 16:14.972
Just until school is over
and we can get out of this dump.

16:17.597 --> 16:19.014
Amber, I'm not...

16:20.555 --> 16:23.847
...ready for a serious relationship.
- Eddie...

16:23.972 --> 16:26.304
I just broke up with Tracey

16:26.429 --> 16:29.471
and I need to play that field.

16:30.138 --> 16:32.763
Play that field.
And I-I don't want to get tied...

16:33.513 --> 16:34.721
down.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.179
OK.

16:39.304 --> 16:42.679
Jesus, just forget I said anything.
- I think that'd be best.

16:44.013 --> 16:45.221
(Amber sighs)

17:00.178 --> 17:02.387
(Birds chirping)

17:03.845 --> 17:06.220
(Alarm ringing)

17:08.887 --> 17:11.678
(Man) Faster! Come on, you pansies!

17:11.803 --> 17:13.720
This isn't knitting club!

17:14.262 --> 17:15.637
Faster!

17:16.428 --> 17:18.095
Come on, Cotter!

17:18.220 --> 17:20.678
I'll make a man out of you yet.

17:20.845 --> 17:23.137
(Man in video) 'Hey.'
- (Woman) 'Hi, how are you?'

17:23.262 --> 17:25.970
(Man) 'Good, you?'
- (Woman) 'Good. I like your bike.'

17:26.095 --> 17:27.970
(Man) 'Cheers.'
- (Woman) 'It's cool.'

17:28.512 --> 17:30.636
(VO on video) 'A guide to love-making.'

17:31.594 --> 17:34.094
(Upbeat 80s music plays in video)

17:45.052 --> 17:48.802
'Jesus will now
make the vagina slippery

17:48.927 --> 17:51.052
to accept the man's love.'

17:54.177 --> 17:56.719
Not Amber's.
- (Laughter)

17:57.469 --> 17:58.469
(Sweeney) Kev.

17:59.927 --> 18:02.261
(Nun) 'Remember, you have an audience.'

18:21.926 --> 18:24.426
'God bless us all.'

18:27.343 --> 18:28.676
(Slow synth music)

18:28.801 --> 18:32.510
So sensitive.
I mean, it's not offensive, it's a fact.

18:32.635 --> 18:35.342
(Boy 1) Obviously it's Oasis.
- (Boy 2) Blur!

18:35.467 --> 18:37.050
(Boy 1) Oasis!
- (Boy 2) Blur!

18:37.175 --> 18:39.050
(Indistinct background chatter)

18:46.217 --> 18:47.217
What?

18:49.800 --> 18:50.842
Do you want the shifts?

18:50.967 --> 18:53.009
(All, gasp)- (Music stops)

18:54.634 --> 18:56.134
Yes.- (Music starts again)

18:56.300 --> 18:58.467
Yes, I do.

19:08.841 --> 19:09.841
Well?

19:10.674 --> 19:11.758
Fine.

19:12.883 --> 19:14.174
I'll be your boyfriend.

19:15.091 --> 19:16.591
Pretend-boyfriend...

19:16.716 --> 19:19.633
Pretend-real boyfriend.

19:19.758 --> 19:21.216
Just till school is over.

19:21.341 --> 19:22.466
Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:22.591 --> 19:23.799
Or...
- Yeah.

19:23.924 --> 19:25.383
Or longer. No?

19:25.924 --> 19:28.466
OK.
- Sss...

19:28.591 --> 19:30.341
Just because we are...

19:31.758 --> 19:35.049
You know, uh...
- You can say it. Gay.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.508
Well, just because...
- I'm gay, you're gay.

19:37.633 --> 19:39.591
We're gay. Two big gays.
- OK...

19:39.715 --> 19:41.298
A big, gay wall.
- Stop saying it.

19:41.423 --> 19:43.882
Stop.
And there's nothing gay about the wall.

19:44.007 --> 19:47.090
But it doesn't matter what we are,
but we don't have to be.

19:49.965 --> 19:51.673
Sure.
- OK.

19:54.590 --> 19:56.257
Ah, mm, ugh...
- If it's gonna work...

19:56.382 --> 19:58.965
What, "ugh"?
It's a hand! So, just take it

19:59.090 --> 20:02.673
because people need to think
that we like each other, so, take it.

20:03.673 --> 20:06.715
(Muttering) See it's...
- We have to... Yeah, thank you.

20:08.048 --> 20:09.548
This was your stupid plan.

20:10.132 --> 20:11.423
X there...

20:13.589 --> 20:17.797
OK, so, substitute your known values
into the...

20:24.506 --> 20:26.006
Eddie, how far did you get?

20:29.131 --> 20:30.547
(Amber) Mm...

20:31.547 --> 20:32.547
Nice.

20:32.672 --> 20:35.589
I always thought you two were benders.
- Kev!

20:35.714 --> 20:38.131
That's it. Principal's office.
- What?

20:38.256 --> 20:41.172
But...I'm being nice!
I'm saying they're not benders!

20:41.297 --> 20:42.214
Now.

20:43.381 --> 20:44.381
Oh, my...

20:46.671 --> 20:47.796
Quicker.

20:50.421 --> 20:53.005
I'm going...as fast...

20:55.921 --> 20:57.088
(...as I can.)

21:02.338 --> 21:04.338
(Door opens, then slams shut)

21:04.463 --> 21:05.713
Guys, no touching.

21:05.838 --> 21:06.838
(Bell rings)

21:15.088 --> 21:16.630
Eddie, could you hang on a sec?

21:19.629 --> 21:21.004
(Eddie) I'll, uh...

21:21.837 --> 21:23.295
see you outside...

21:24.629 --> 21:26.212
...sweetheart?

21:26.337 --> 21:27.837
Sure thing, babe.

21:28.754 --> 21:29.837
(Kissing sounds)

21:33.420 --> 21:34.754
(Door closes)

21:35.795 --> 21:36.795
Everything OK?

21:38.004 --> 21:39.379
Yeah.

21:39.504 --> 21:42.754
Just if the guys are giving you stick,
you can talk to me.

21:43.837 --> 21:46.837
They're not.
They're not, it's just, um...

21:48.254 --> 21:49.628
It's just...

21:50.378 --> 21:53.378
High...jinks. High jinks.
It's high, high jinks.

21:55.128 --> 21:56.169
OK.

21:58.753 --> 22:01.836
Well, if you need to talk,
I'm here, all right?

22:02.711 --> 22:05.711
(Eddie) Mm-hm.
- OK, cool. See you later.

22:05.836 --> 22:06.961
OK.

22:07.961 --> 22:10.086
(Slow electro beat)

22:29.085 --> 22:31.585
(Amber) Did you confess
your love for Sweeney?

22:31.710 --> 22:32.710
(Eddie) Shut up.

22:32.835 --> 22:34.877
I don't get it,
he looks like a maths teacher.

22:35.002 --> 22:37.877
Because you're a lesbian
and he is a maths teacher.

22:38.002 --> 22:41.793
Speaking of which, you should act
a little less...you know...

22:42.627 --> 22:43.627
...mannishly.

22:45.168 --> 22:46.377
What?

22:47.418 --> 22:48.627
Walk more feminine.

22:49.002 --> 22:51.835
Feminine?
- Yes, fem... Just a bit of hip!

22:51.960 --> 22:54.334
So, like you?
- (Scoffs)

22:56.376 --> 22:57.751
Wait, what am I doing wrong?

22:58.417 --> 23:01.751
Basically, walk like
you're repressing all of your emotions

23:01.876 --> 23:03.501
and you have no joints.

23:04.876 --> 23:05.751
OK.

23:06.626 --> 23:08.542
No, no!
- (Amber chuckles)

23:08.667 --> 23:11.751
By the way, if anyone asks,
I have already fingered you.

23:12.292 --> 23:13.917
After one day?!

23:14.042 --> 23:16.626
I want people to think I'm straight,
not a slut.

23:17.542 --> 23:20.001
Wasn't slut
a patrarchal construct?

23:20.501 --> 23:21.459
Patriarchal!

23:21.584 --> 23:23.459
A patriarchal construct.
- Jesus!

23:23.626 --> 23:26.084
This is what happens
when you teach men new words.

23:30.583 --> 23:33.125
And they pay you ten quid?
- Yep.

23:33.250 --> 23:35.291
Who?
- Everyone.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.750
Your mam has no clue?
- No.

23:40.625 --> 23:41.791
How much have you made?

23:42.541 --> 23:44.083
Nearly 2,000.

23:44.541 --> 23:46.166
Yeah, that's a lot of tenners.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.916
Well, there are a lot of horny teens.

23:49.416 --> 23:51.583
Plus, I need as much as I can get.

23:52.250 --> 23:55.416
The minute school is over,
I am out of here.

23:57.750 --> 23:59.125
This place will kill you.

24:03.457 --> 24:04.707
Where are you gonna go?

24:05.582 --> 24:06.832
London.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.124
I'm going to open
an anarchist bookshop,

24:10.249 --> 24:12.040
but with franchise potential.

24:13.082 --> 24:14.832
It's a good idea.
- Yeah.

24:15.457 --> 24:18.415
Anyway, I'd better go.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.040
Some horny teens need me.

24:20.165 --> 24:21.457
(Amber chuckles)

24:21.624 --> 24:23.290
Come to my house
for dinner tomorrow?

24:25.374 --> 24:26.665
OK.

24:28.415 --> 24:31.956
Wear something girly!
- I will if you won't!

24:41.539 --> 24:44.498
First girlfriend home for dinner.
- Second girlfriend.

24:45.539 --> 24:47.581
I thought
the first one didn't count or...

24:47.706 --> 24:49.248
No, she definitely does.

24:49.373 --> 24:51.414
Oh.
- (Door closes)

24:52.831 --> 24:55.248
You'd better get changed.
Amber's gonna be here.

24:55.373 --> 24:58.956
Who?
- Eddie's Amber. Amber Keenan.

25:00.623 --> 25:02.914
Oh, right, yes. Yeah, right.

25:03.039 --> 25:07.163
Didn't she find her dad hanging--
- Not the time, Ian.

25:07.288 --> 25:08.288
Right.

25:09.038 --> 25:11.580
Uh, how did the fitness test go?
- Great.

25:11.705 --> 25:12.788
Good.

25:13.247 --> 25:15.830
Imagine if the Commandant's son
didn't make the cut.

25:16.830 --> 25:18.455
I'd never live it down.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.497
I mean, of course I would.

25:20.622 --> 25:22.455
Of course I WOULD.
Of course you will.

25:23.205 --> 25:24.830
(Doorbell rings)

25:24.955 --> 25:27.413
Yeah, you should...go and get that.

25:30.538 --> 25:31.913
(Eddie) Oh, my God.

25:40.287 --> 25:41.662
You look beautiful.

25:42.412 --> 25:43.662
Thanks.

25:44.454 --> 25:46.996
You're welcome. So, can I...
- Mm...

25:47.121 --> 25:48.329
Come here.

25:49.037 --> 25:50.412
Right, OK.

25:50.537 --> 25:52.121
Come in.
- (Hannah) Hi!

25:52.246 --> 25:54.454
Hello.
- (Eddie) Come in, please.

26:02.579 --> 26:04.579
(Mouthing)

26:08.371 --> 26:09.786
Um... (Clears her throat)

26:09.911 --> 26:13.620
Amber, Eddie was saying that you
help your mam out in the caravan park.

26:13.745 --> 26:14.620
I hate it.

26:16.245 --> 26:17.745
Right. It's-It's nice for her.

26:20.661 --> 26:24.245
Do you, um... Or have you
decided what you'll do next year?

26:26.120 --> 26:30.578
Probably study English
or History or Politics,

26:30.703 --> 26:32.453
or maybe work for a zine.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.911
It's a self-published magazine.

26:36.078 --> 26:37.078
(Mouthing)

26:37.828 --> 26:40.703
Um, is there much money
in the zine scene?

26:41.952 --> 26:43.202
Tonnes.

26:43.327 --> 26:46.994
Oh. That's interesting. Eddie,
you might consider that as a choice.

26:48.369 --> 26:51.285
I'm joining the army.
- But it's just one option, isn't it?

26:51.952 --> 26:53.369
It's a very solid option.

26:54.244 --> 26:56.327
The army takes a lot of sacrifice,
that's all.

26:56.869 --> 26:58.702
(Softly) So does marriage.
- Pardon?

27:01.327 --> 27:03.910
So does marriage.
- What sacrifices have you made?

27:05.660 --> 27:08.035
Do you want it in writing?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.494
Like a list?
- Yes, a list.

27:09.619 --> 27:11.619
How long have we got?
- A very tiny list.

27:11.744 --> 27:12.619
Get your A4 pad.

27:12.744 --> 27:16.409
I think that Eddie
would look really manly and hot

27:16.534 --> 27:17.618
in uniform.

27:19.326 --> 27:22.743
I mean, morally, I don't agree with
national armies, but still...

27:23.659 --> 27:26.451
Super sexy!
- (Eddie grunts) Mm-hm.

27:27.034 --> 27:28.534
Thank you, babe.
- Yeah.

27:28.659 --> 27:30.034
We're gonna go to my room.

27:30.618 --> 27:32.909
Oh. Uh, yeah, of course.

27:33.576 --> 27:36.493
Oh, do you want some, um...trifle?
Do you want...?

27:36.618 --> 27:37.951
I-I can bring it up in...

27:38.076 --> 27:39.451
in two cups.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.076
Leave your door open.
- (Door closes)

27:43.618 --> 27:46.533
Don't worry, they haven't had sex yet.
- Jesus Christ.

27:48.533 --> 27:50.075
He's only just fingered her.

27:55.117 --> 27:57.367
Your parents don't seem happy.
- They're fine!

28:01.908 --> 28:02.908
Jesus.

28:03.658 --> 28:06.450
This must be what the inside
of your gay brain looks like.

28:06.575 --> 28:08.950
No. No, there's nothing gay
about my room!

28:09.075 --> 28:10.742
Those are bullet shells.

28:10.867 --> 28:12.033
Bullets.

28:18.033 --> 28:20.282
Ow! What was that for?

28:20.407 --> 28:21.574
Sorry.

28:21.991 --> 28:24.782
Wanted to distract you
from your parents' shit marriage.

28:25.574 --> 28:27.699
You're gonna die a virgin.
- No, I'm not.

28:27.824 --> 28:29.366
Hm, yes, you are.

28:29.491 --> 28:30.616
No.

28:31.324 --> 28:32.574
I mean...

28:33.699 --> 28:34.949
I'm not a virgin.

28:36.241 --> 28:37.366
Really?

28:37.907 --> 28:40.074
(Stammering) With a guy, girl...?

28:40.199 --> 28:42.616
Guy.
- A girl? Guy? It was a guy.

28:43.116 --> 28:44.949
He was staying
at the caravan park.

28:46.366 --> 28:48.616
Just wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.

28:49.907 --> 28:51.032
What was it like?

28:52.281 --> 28:53.281
Awful.

28:54.490 --> 28:56.448
He looked like
he was having a stroke.

28:59.698 --> 29:00.948
(Eddie groans)

29:01.531 --> 29:05.240
(Amber makes orgasm noises)

29:07.365 --> 29:08.781
(Laughs)

29:13.948 --> 29:15.948
I don't think we're missing anything.

29:18.656 --> 29:19.740
Not really.

29:22.115 --> 29:23.406
Me neither.

29:26.572 --> 29:28.530
See you tomorrow?
- Mm-hm.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.697
(Both) We should...
- Yeah. We should...

29:35.822 --> 29:38.239
(Exaggerated kissing noises)

29:39.780 --> 29:41.864
(Eddie winces) Don't bite me!

29:41.989 --> 29:43.197
Evidence!

29:44.322 --> 29:46.489
(Slow music)

29:48.697 --> 29:50.280
(Hannah) Don't-Don't move.

29:52.155 --> 29:53.822
(Indistinct chatter)

29:59.196 --> 30:01.029
(Kev) Go on, Eddie, good man.

30:04.529 --> 30:05.821
What?

30:12.821 --> 30:15.613
No one's saying
Thatcher wasn't horrendous,

30:15.738 --> 30:17.613
but think of the arch.

30:20.779 --> 30:22.529
(Music builds)

30:25.988 --> 30:27.446
(Grunting effort)

30:28.778 --> 30:29.820
(Eddie) Oh, my God!

30:36.403 --> 30:38.820
(Sex noises in caravan)
- Done your maths?

30:38.945 --> 30:41.153
Yeah.
- Same.

30:42.695 --> 30:45.320
(Mutters) I did my maths.
- (Boy in caravan) Oh, yeah.

30:59.403 --> 31:00.987
I'm going to live near Camden.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.527
It's where all the punks live.

31:04.569 --> 31:07.444
Maybe Hackney.
It's on the Victoria line.

31:08.569 --> 31:09.944
Maybe Soho.

31:12.361 --> 31:13.777
Probably Soho.

31:25.277 --> 31:26.152
Nice.

31:26.277 --> 31:28.194
(Music continues)

31:36.026 --> 31:39.110
(Music fades)
- No more popping sweets, ladies.

31:39.235 --> 31:41.443
This is it. It's now...

31:42.860 --> 31:44.026
...or never.

31:44.151 --> 31:48.985
You can be men
or you can be...telephonists.

31:49.818 --> 31:52.860
(Grunting efforts)
- (Man) This isn't knitting club!

31:55.026 --> 31:56.651
Come on, Cotter!

31:58.943 --> 32:00.110
Come on, Cian!

32:00.235 --> 32:02.818
(Man 2)Fucking let's go, let's go!

32:02.943 --> 32:05.860
(Man) Faster, faster!
- (Man 2) Get up that hill!

32:07.275 --> 32:10.067
(Whistle blowing)
- (Man) Come on, Cotter, move it!

32:10.192 --> 32:13.609
This isn't...crochet for beginners!

32:13.734 --> 32:15.525
(Eddie grunting and panting)

32:19.234 --> 32:21.234
Come on. Don't give up yet.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.775
Money.

32:29.109 --> 32:30.400
Have you got any?

32:30.525 --> 32:32.317
(Both) Are you serious?

32:32.442 --> 32:36.734
I am not Mother fucking Theresa
for Kildare's hard-up teens!

32:38.317 --> 32:39.608
With fucking hard-ons!

32:39.733 --> 32:41.858
OK, relax.

32:42.441 --> 32:44.649
Jesus.
- I bet Eddie isn't like this.

32:44.774 --> 32:46.233
(Softly) No.
- (Guy) Um...

32:46.983 --> 32:49.274
Here. Take these.

32:50.733 --> 32:52.233
No, they're good, I promise.

32:53.316 --> 32:54.983
They actually are pretty good.

32:57.316 --> 32:58.733
You're barred for a month.

33:01.149 --> 33:04.316
We're not doing it in the bushes again.
- What's wrong with them?

33:05.899 --> 33:07.191
(Amber sighs)

33:08.108 --> 33:10.524
(Slow sombre music)

33:50.939 --> 33:53.272
Uh, do you have a fake ID?
- No.

33:53.397 --> 33:54.689
Well, uh, get one.

33:54.814 --> 33:57.189
Don't forget to vote, sir.
Thank you.

33:57.314 --> 33:59.022
(Sweeney) What the fuck is this?

34:01.647 --> 34:02.939
You know...

34:03.939 --> 34:08.063
...this is the longest that no one's
called me a lesbian since my dad died.

34:09.772 --> 34:11.981
A good week after that
there was just...

34:12.856 --> 34:14.397
silence.

34:15.896 --> 34:17.605
Almost made it worth it.

34:19.396 --> 34:20.688
Do you miss him?

34:25.605 --> 34:27.855
People think he must've been miserable,

34:27.980 --> 34:29.396
but he wasn't.

34:29.813 --> 34:31.521
He always laughed with me and mam.

34:33.896 --> 34:35.438
This place killed him.

34:36.855 --> 34:40.021
If it makes you feel any better,
I think I'm gonna fail the Cadets.

34:42.355 --> 34:45.146
Yeah, it's not dead-dad bad,
but still...

34:45.813 --> 34:47.021
(Amber chuckles)

34:49.228 --> 34:52.062
For what it's worth,
I think you're fascist enough.

34:52.395 --> 34:53.645
Thanks.

34:57.770 --> 34:59.145
Come on, let's go.

34:59.270 --> 35:00.354
We have school.

35:00.479 --> 35:02.687
Oh, fuck it!
We're going to Dublin.

35:13.854 --> 35:15.437
Don't touch me.
- Totally fair.

35:15.562 --> 35:17.354
(Upbeat synth music)

35:35.811 --> 35:37.936
(Tannoy) 'Next station is Dublin.'

35:38.061 --> 35:39.603
(Seagulls squawking)

36:02.602 --> 36:04.268
(Music builds)

36:14.227 --> 36:17.643
Why don't you just skip the Commandos
and come away with me?

36:20.893 --> 36:22.477
(Distant laughter)

36:25.517 --> 36:26.976
What?

36:27.101 --> 36:28.684
(Distant singing)

36:31.934 --> 36:35.976
# I'll always love you

36:38.434 --> 36:44.434
# And you can be there

36:46.059 --> 36:52.642
# To hug me
# (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

36:52.767 --> 36:55.726
# Though someone

36:57.017 --> 36:59.391
# That you've met

37:03.516 --> 37:08.891
# Has made you forget
# (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)... #

37:09.016 --> 37:12.016
We should probably
stick together so that we...

37:12.141 --> 37:15.350
Wha...?
- # You can count

37:16.225 --> 37:19.475
# On me

37:19.600 --> 37:23.975
# (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

37:24.100 --> 37:27.725
(Miming) # Well, I wish

37:27.850 --> 37:30.474
# I wish you success

37:31.682 --> 37:33.849
# And loads

37:35.474 --> 37:38.015
# Loads of happiness

37:39.724 --> 37:41.265
# But baby

37:43.265 --> 37:45.682
# I got to confess

37:47.307 --> 37:53.807
(Muffled) # I'll be lonely

37:55.390 --> 37:57.307
# If you ever

37:58.182 --> 38:01.474
# Oh, if you ever need a friend... #

38:02.889 --> 38:04.598
You OK, baby gay?

38:05.598 --> 38:06.889
Do you know me?

38:07.723 --> 38:08.806
No.

38:08.931 --> 38:11.056
# Until the end

38:11.639 --> 38:14.514
(Miming) # And you

38:14.639 --> 38:17.264
# Can depend

38:18.473 --> 38:22.639
# On me
# (Do-doo, doo)... #

38:22.764 --> 38:24.473
Hi.
- Hi.

38:25.389 --> 38:26.639
I'm Sarah.

38:27.139 --> 38:28.639
I'm not a lesbian.

38:29.306 --> 38:30.806
Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:30.931 --> 38:33.389
Sorry, I didn't... I wasn't saying that.
- No, no...

38:33.514 --> 38:36.180
I-I'm here with my boyfriend...

38:37.388 --> 38:41.763
...who is usually straighter than that.
- (Sarah) OK.

38:43.222 --> 38:48.222
(Miming)
#But, darling, I've gotta confess

38:49.722 --> 38:52.263
# I'm gonna be lonely... #

38:53.013 --> 38:54.430
(Eddie, quietly) Oh, shit.

38:55.472 --> 38:59.722
# Oh, if you ever

39:00.555 --> 39:03.888
# Oh, if you ever need a friend... #
- (Laughter)

39:06.347 --> 39:07.804
Come on, we have to go.

39:09.054 --> 39:11.012
Eddie, this is Sarah.

39:11.137 --> 39:14.012
She studies German
at Trinity.

39:14.512 --> 39:18.471
Well, what's the German for
"We're going to miss the last train"?

39:18.596 --> 39:23.179
Um...Wir werden den letzten Zug verpassen.

39:23.887 --> 39:24.887
Wow.

39:26.929 --> 39:30.554
You know, but, you know, you both know
who else spoke German, though.

39:30.679 --> 39:31.679
Hitler.

39:34.721 --> 39:35.721
I...

39:36.804 --> 39:38.221
(Song ends)
- (Applause)

39:38.346 --> 39:41.428
(Performer) Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

39:44.595 --> 39:46.011
Was that just a...

39:46.678 --> 39:48.845
Just a fact or an insult?

39:49.636 --> 39:53.136
Uh, honestly, he's not great at either.

39:56.761 --> 39:57.761
Fuck.

39:59.511 --> 40:03.220
I know it looks like
I'm "obeying my man", but...

40:03.345 --> 40:08.095
we really WILL miss the train
and my mam really WILL kill me.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.594
Well... Well...

40:16.927 --> 40:18.219
I'm gonna be at this

40:18.344 --> 40:22.802
on Saturday
if you...happen to be around.

40:24.052 --> 40:25.677
No stress either way, just...

40:26.594 --> 40:27.677
Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:27.802 --> 40:29.260
(Both, awkward laughter)

40:42.802 --> 40:44.135
(Ian grunts) Hey.

40:54.009 --> 40:57.301
Uh, your mum just needed some space,
I was...

40:58.343 --> 41:00.509
...snoring too loud again.

41:06.843 --> 41:09.468
Were you with Amber?
- Yeah.

41:12.009 --> 41:14.259
Hey, don't worry,
I won't give you a hard time.

41:18.508 --> 41:21.383
My dad used to give me
such a bollocking.

41:22.758 --> 41:23.883
Jesus...

41:24.883 --> 41:26.425
He was stern, you know?

41:28.133 --> 41:29.425
Didn't show emotion.

41:31.592 --> 41:34.758
But...that's what
men were like back then.

41:36.175 --> 41:37.800
You know, cold. They...

41:38.883 --> 41:40.342
...never showed their love.

41:52.924 --> 41:54.757
(Whimpering)

42:06.924 --> 42:08.466
(Jill) Where the hell were you?

42:10.924 --> 42:13.132
Nowhere.
- Were you drinking?

42:13.257 --> 42:15.424
I may have had
a little glass of something.

42:15.549 --> 42:17.341
What would your father say?

42:18.424 --> 42:21.216
Well, you don't get an opinion
if you kill yourself!

42:22.590 --> 42:24.840
(Slow sombre music)

42:33.506 --> 42:35.506
(Footsteps walking away)

42:59.589 --> 43:02.922
It's simple, the thing with girls
is that it's all about eye contact.

43:03.047 --> 43:04.297
You just...stare at them?

43:05.130 --> 43:06.714
Y-You, yeah. Well, no.

43:06.839 --> 43:09.672
Y-You look at them
until you...get their attention.

43:11.339 --> 43:14.380
Just keep looking.
- That's exactly what I do.

43:14.505 --> 43:16.755
(Stammers) Yeah, OK.

43:19.547 --> 43:21.505
So, you've never fucked yet?
- Uh...

43:22.589 --> 43:23.630
No.

43:24.505 --> 43:27.379
Waiting for the right time.
- What's the matter, can't get it up?

43:27.504 --> 43:28.963
At least I have a girlfriend.

43:29.088 --> 43:33.463
Ohhh.
- Well, I've had loads of sex, so...

43:34.129 --> 43:35.129
With who?

43:35.254 --> 43:36.504
Ohhh.

43:36.629 --> 43:38.963
Well, it was on...
It was on holiday! So...

43:39.088 --> 43:41.838
Course it was.
- Yeah, it was, actually.

43:41.963 --> 43:45.046
Spain, 1993, you heard of it?
No, you wouldn't.

43:45.171 --> 43:48.379
It was great. Shut up! Leave me alone.
Don't look at me like that.

43:51.171 --> 43:53.254
(Eddie)
I was thinking about what you said.

43:53.379 --> 43:56.504
About how the state
just wants to control vaginas?

43:57.629 --> 44:00.503
No, the other, uh, thing.

44:00.628 --> 44:02.628
About me coming to London with you.

44:03.795 --> 44:06.878
Shit, Cotter!
Are you going to defect?

44:07.003 --> 44:10.253
No. No, I'm just...thinking out loud.

44:10.962 --> 44:13.587
I mean,
I suppose I can make room, but...

44:13.712 --> 44:16.128
you'd have to pull your weight.
- Fine.

44:16.253 --> 44:19.212
And I don't think
a punk zine is going to pay two wages.

44:19.670 --> 44:22.212
Will it pay one?
- Jesus.

44:22.337 --> 44:24.295
London will eat
your country arse alive.

44:24.420 --> 44:26.587
We've grown up
a quarter of a mile away.

44:26.712 --> 44:29.712
Yeah, but I have a city mentality.

44:31.128 --> 44:33.669
(Sighs)
These two are the worst.

44:35.252 --> 44:36.419
You know, I...

44:37.752 --> 44:40.127
We should tell people
that we've slept together.

44:40.252 --> 44:42.002
What?! Why?

44:42.127 --> 44:44.711
Because when you're as passionate
as we are,

44:44.836 --> 44:46.919
it's the most
natural thing in the world.

44:47.836 --> 44:49.627
They were saying it this morning.

44:50.336 --> 44:51.586
On one condition.

44:52.419 --> 44:55.294
We go to this...on Saturday.

44:56.127 --> 44:58.419
(Eddie sighs)
- Please.

44:58.544 --> 45:02.711
I'll give you the best pretend-orgasm
you've ever had.

45:03.877 --> 45:05.376
And wasn't it cool?

45:05.960 --> 45:07.668
Being TOTALLY anonymous?

45:08.460 --> 45:11.460
Will your mam even let you out?
- Leave that to me.

45:12.418 --> 45:14.460
Do you want to make fun
of their sex noises?

45:14.585 --> 45:17.168
Hey, what the fuck?
- I can't, I have training.

45:17.960 --> 45:20.960
I thought
that you were conscientiously objecting?

45:21.126 --> 45:23.043
I promised my dad.
- Ugh.

45:25.001 --> 45:26.001
Bye!

45:26.126 --> 45:27.335
Bye!

45:28.251 --> 45:29.585
(Electro beat)

45:29.710 --> 45:31.085
This is it, son.

45:31.210 --> 45:35.418
No TVs, no VHS, no CDs.

45:35.543 --> 45:37.917
Just man time.
- (Eddie groans)

45:39.917 --> 45:41.125
(Eddie grunts)

45:43.500 --> 45:44.792
(Indistinct mumbling)

45:47.000 --> 45:50.792
Remember, if I wasn't your father,
you'd be dead right now.

45:51.625 --> 45:54.500
Why?
- Remember, food is everywhere.

45:54.625 --> 45:57.459
Remember,
if you lose your clothes,

45:58.417 --> 45:59.709
you can make clothes.

46:00.209 --> 46:03.334
Remember,
fish are nature's Pot Noodles.

46:05.209 --> 46:06.292
OK.

46:08.917 --> 46:10.166
(Squish)

46:11.708 --> 46:15.124
(Slow sombre song)

46:21.083 --> 46:24.333
# She's my wild rose

46:27.249 --> 46:30.666
# My dark-haired lover

46:32.749 --> 46:34.666
# Dipping her feet

46:37.916 --> 46:40.208

46:40.333 --> 46:43.665
(Song continues in distance)

46:57.998 --> 46:59.415
(Hannah) Hm.

47:10.248 --> 47:11.332
(Exhales)

47:19.456 --> 47:20.706
Oh, right.

47:27.706 --> 47:29.289
We need to see the play for school.

47:32.539 --> 47:33.997
Is that so?

47:35.539 --> 47:36.539
Well...

47:37.497 --> 47:41.081
It's the difference between an A and a B
and I want an A.

47:42.539 --> 47:44.747
I want to make dad proud.
- Oh, Jesus.

47:45.706 --> 47:46.913
OK.

47:48.163 --> 47:49.955
Be back by midnight.

47:51.080 --> 47:52.330
I promise.

47:54.913 --> 47:57.663
(Door opens)
- (Footsteps climbing upstairs)

48:00.496 --> 48:01.580
You have a lovely home.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.830
And now I know you're a liar.

48:15.788 --> 48:16.913
Well...

48:18.955 --> 48:21.079
(Amber) Come on!- I...I'm gonna go.

48:23.620 --> 48:25.870
(Uplifting music)

48:40.954 --> 48:42.037
Here.

48:42.162 --> 48:43.870
I got these
instead of a tenner.

48:44.370 --> 48:45.704
I dunno, I...

48:45.829 --> 48:48.704
I-I don't think
soldiers can take drugs, so...

48:49.537 --> 48:50.537
Yeah.

48:50.662 --> 48:53.244
You're thinking of the police.
- (Softly) Am I?

48:55.786 --> 48:56.786
(Tapping on window)

48:56.911 --> 48:58.911
Hurry the fuck up!

48:59.036 --> 49:00.369
(Sighs) OK.

49:01.578 --> 49:03.578
(Techno music)

49:06.161 --> 49:08.744
(Animated chatter and whooping)

49:29.452 --> 49:32.327
(# LE GALAXIE: "Love System")

49:44.410 --> 49:46.410

# Gotta get that love system

49:48.160 --> 49:50.285
# Love system, love system... #

49:50.410 --> 49:53.535

49:53.660 --> 49:55.243

50:14.826 --> 50:17.076
(Sarah) Amber.

50:18.992 --> 50:22.159
(Sarah) Are you OK?
- (Amber) Yeah!

50:29.908 --> 50:32.366
I didn't know if you'd come.
- Mm...

50:32.491 --> 50:34.283
Well, here I am.

50:41.616 --> 50:43.283
I need to make a confession.

50:45.575 --> 50:47.658
I don't actually have a boyfriend.

50:48.491 --> 50:49.741
Not really.

50:51.283 --> 50:53.991
The whole penis thing
kind of makes me vom.

50:59.741 --> 51:01.491
No, I'm not a fan either.

51:03.490 --> 51:04.615
Good.

51:05.157 --> 51:07.949
That's good.
- (Both laugh)

51:09.740 --> 51:10.907
(Man) Sorry.

51:13.449 --> 51:15.032
(Dance music)

51:17.157 --> 51:18.365
Hi.

51:18.490 --> 51:19.615
What?

51:19.740 --> 51:20.949
Hi!

51:22.074 --> 51:24.407
Hi.
- You a student?

51:25.407 --> 51:26.574
Uh...

51:27.449 --> 51:28.865
No, no.

51:29.449 --> 51:31.574
No, I'm not.
I'm here with my girlfriend.

51:31.699 --> 51:33.699
She's out there,
we're moving to London.

51:35.114 --> 51:36.448
Right. So...

51:47.156 --> 51:48.823
(Music becomes distorted)

51:52.781 --> 51:55.281
(Slow stringed music
drowns out dance music)

52:20.572 --> 52:23.197
(Slow music fades)
- (Dance music fades back in)

52:23.863 --> 52:25.322
Cian?

52:25.447 --> 52:29.072
Get the fuck off me!
- Jesus, what the fuck is your problem?

52:32.322 --> 52:34.447
Eddie, wait, please.
Eddie. Eddie!

52:34.572 --> 52:36.655
Don't fucking touch me!
- (All) Whoa!

52:39.321 --> 52:40.862
(Eddie) Get the fuck off me!

52:41.862 --> 52:43.487
Shit. Eddie!

52:43.612 --> 52:46.612
(Eddie) Get the fuck off me!
- Leave him alone!

52:47.446 --> 52:50.737

52:50.862 --> 52:52.446
(Amber) Hate crime!

52:53.321 --> 52:54.321
Fuck!

52:55.279 --> 52:57.279
I am SO sorry.

53:05.946 --> 53:08.571
(Out of breath) Fuck, fuck, fuck...

53:09.571 --> 53:10.987
(Groaning) Fuck!

53:12.236 --> 53:15.611
(Softly) OK, OK, OK, OK...

53:15.736 --> 53:18.028
OK. OK...

53:20.653 --> 53:21.945
(Amber) Eddie!

53:24.570 --> 53:26.778
What the hell was that?!
- Where did you go?!

53:26.903 --> 53:28.236
I was in the other room!

53:28.361 --> 53:31.153
Well, no! No, you weren't!
You just left me alone in there!

53:31.278 --> 53:34.320
What happened?!
- (Eddie whimpers)

53:36.861 --> 53:40.403
Hey. Hey. Hey.

53:41.945 --> 53:43.320
It's OK.

53:45.777 --> 53:48.402
(Softly) It's OK. It's OK.

53:51.860 --> 53:53.402
I have you now.

53:54.944 --> 53:56.360
I have you now.

54:10.110 --> 54:11.735
I mean, this isn't so bad.

54:14.194 --> 54:15.610
You know, maybe...

54:17.276 --> 54:18.984
Maybe it could be nice.

54:21.401 --> 54:22.818
And maybe...

54:24.651 --> 54:26.151
Maybe it could work.

54:27.984 --> 54:29.026
Like...

54:30.693 --> 54:32.151
Like properly.

54:33.026 --> 54:35.109
(Slow sombre music)

54:40.318 --> 54:42.901
(Church bell rings)
- (Seagulls squawking)

55:14.067 --> 55:15.692
What happened last night?

55:16.442 --> 55:18.275
You scared the shit out of me.

55:21.191 --> 55:22.607
It was just the drugs.

55:27.816 --> 55:29.982
(Sombre music continues, then fades)

55:35.691 --> 55:37.566
Maybe they didn't even notice.

55:39.899 --> 55:41.399
(Sighing) Fuck.

55:43.316 --> 55:44.691
Double fuck.

55:46.774 --> 55:49.149
(Jill) Get out of the car. Now!

55:49.274 --> 55:51.774
Mam, I--
- Don't you dare speak!

55:51.899 --> 55:54.940
I don't want your delinquent son
anywhere near my daughter!

55:55.065 --> 55:57.815
Well, I don't want your weird daughter
near my son.

55:57.940 --> 56:01.273
Yeah! I mean, she's actually lovely,
but still, fuck you.

56:01.398 --> 56:03.231
Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

56:03.356 --> 56:05.106
Fuck you!
- Fuck off!

56:05.231 --> 56:07.356
(Ian, quietly) Hannah!
- She started it.

56:10.356 --> 56:12.606
Good luck.
- You too.

56:12.731 --> 56:13.565
(Jill) Get in!

56:15.940 --> 56:17.940
(Amber) Sorry, mam.
- (Car starts)

56:31.647 --> 56:33.522
You are in for it now,
young man.

56:34.064 --> 56:35.564
Can I go to my room?

56:36.939 --> 56:37.939
Sure.

56:47.980 --> 56:49.064
Good boy.

56:53.897 --> 56:55.439
Are we not going to punish him?

56:56.147 --> 56:59.521
When you're not absent half of the year
then you can have a say.

57:07.521 --> 57:09.604
Do you want a...
Do you want a Winkle?

57:11.729 --> 57:13.646
(Parents shouting in the distance)

57:20.521 --> 57:21.729
Eddie?

57:22.771 --> 57:23.813
What?

57:24.354 --> 57:26.188
Did you, uh, did you use protection?

57:28.563 --> 57:29.854
Lots of it.

57:31.103 --> 57:32.312
Good. Good.

57:32.437 --> 57:34.812
Cos, uh, you wouldn't want
to get a girl pregnant,

57:34.937 --> 57:38.853
then have to get married too young,
and then get divorced

57:38.978 --> 57:42.187
cos you're fighting,
cos you're away working all the time.

57:43.062 --> 57:44.270
What?

57:44.395 --> 57:47.145
Y-You see,
love is like a flame,

57:47.270 --> 57:49.312
it burns you when it's hot.

57:50.520 --> 57:51.770
Where's that from?

57:52.228 --> 57:53.978
I, uh, I heard it in a song.

57:55.228 --> 57:57.687
(Slow guitar instrumental)

58:01.270 --> 58:05.477
# Our love's gone wrong again

58:07.686 --> 58:11.936
# Our love's gone wrong again

58:13.977 --> 58:16.269
# It seemed so true

58:16.394 --> 58:19.311
# But now I say to you

58:20.436 --> 58:24.352
# Our love's gone wrong again... #
- (Song drowns out argument)

58:27.269 --> 58:30.894
# You shone a light in my eye... #

58:33.602 --> 58:35.810
(Eddie) Hey.
- (Song fades)

58:36.560 --> 58:38.518
My mam will kill you
if she sees us.

58:39.476 --> 58:40.476
I don't care.

58:41.601 --> 58:43.185
We should take some time.

58:45.643 --> 58:47.935
Just to let my mam cool down.

58:50.101 --> 58:51.226
OK.

58:53.310 --> 58:54.726
But just like a few days.

58:56.893 --> 58:58.435
Something like that.

58:59.310 --> 59:00.476
OK.

59:01.851 --> 59:03.185
Let's say two days, then.

59:06.101 --> 59:07.685
See you in two days!

59:11.017 --> 59:15.059
(All singing)
# You say you want

59:15.184 --> 59:19.225
# Diamonds on a ring of gold

59:19.350 --> 59:23.350
# You say you want

59:23.475 --> 59:27.309
# Your story to remain untold

59:27.434 --> 59:31.184
# All the promises we made

59:31.309 --> 59:35.100
# From the cradle to the grave

59:35.225 --> 59:39.100
(Harmonising)
# When all I want

59:39.225 --> 59:42.599
# Is you

59:43.558 --> 59:47.516
# You say you'll give me

59:47.641 --> 59:51.683
(Harmonising)
# A highway with no one on it

59:51.808 --> 59:55.391
(Harmonising)
# Treasure just to look upon it

59:55.516 --> 59:59.516
# All the riches in the night #

01:00:05.183 --> 01:00:07.724
I heard you and Eddie
are going through a rough patch.

01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:10.683
Just hang in there.
You two are so in love.

01:00:12.058 --> 01:00:13.515
Thanks.
- Come on, babe.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.140
Don't call me babe.
- Fair.

01:00:24.265 --> 01:00:25.515
Brian Dermody.
- Here.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.807

- Here.

01:00:26.932 --> 01:00:28.348
Essa O'Riley.
- Here.

01:00:28.473 --> 01:00:29.682
Amber Keenan.

01:00:30.807 --> 01:00:32.098
Eddie, where's Amber?

01:00:34.015 --> 01:00:36.098
I... Uh, she's not feeling well.

01:00:36.223 --> 01:00:37.473
Is she OK or...?

01:00:39.098 --> 01:00:42.015
Period stuff.
- OK, thank you very much for that.

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.390

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:44.515
Tracey Brennan.
- Here.

Woody Ferguson.
- Here.

01:00:46.139 --> 01:00:47.222
Eddie Cotter.
- Here.

01:00:48.306 --> 01:00:50.431
We're just pretending to go out.

01:00:51.722 --> 01:00:54.056
Just until school is over
and I can get out.

01:00:54.181 --> 01:00:55.472
So, he's your beard.

01:00:57.389 --> 01:00:58.889
Basically.

01:00:59.472 --> 01:01:00.889
Makes sense, I guess.

01:01:01.764 --> 01:01:02.806
Does your mam know?

01:01:02.931 --> 01:01:05.556
(Chuckles) Christ, no. God...

01:01:06.514 --> 01:01:08.181
She'd order an exorcism.

01:01:14.222 --> 01:01:16.681
So, what now?
- Well, let's get out of here.

01:01:21.096 --> 01:01:23.971

01:01:28.263 --> 01:01:29.471

Really?

01:01:57.679 --> 01:01:59.512
I thought cos your husband's dead...

01:02:00.012 --> 01:02:02.512
You can keep the Mrs.
- Keep the Mrs. OK.

01:02:02.637 --> 01:02:04.262
It's a thing.
- Mm-hm, OK.

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.595
Uh, is Amber home?
- No.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.512
She must be off seeing a PLAY
with someone else.

01:02:58.968 --> 01:03:04.302
# And I just stood there
bathed in the quiet, no

01:03:04.427 --> 01:03:08.843
# You say you'll cut your bangs
I'm calling your bluff

01:03:09.885 --> 01:03:14.927
# When you lie to me
it's in the small stuff

01:03:15.052 --> 01:03:20.010
# You say you'll cut your bangs
I'm calling your bluff

01:03:20.677 --> 01:03:25.343
# When you lie to me
it's in the small stuff #

01:03:27.177 --> 01:03:29.634
So...just remember to pace yourself.

01:03:29.759 --> 01:03:31.967
And never push too hard at the start.

01:03:32.717 --> 01:03:35.551
Remember the rabbit and the tortoise.
- And the hare!

01:03:36.426 --> 01:03:37.842
The tortoise and the hare.

01:03:37.967 --> 01:03:41.342
Yeah, and don't worry about
who's passing you, it's a long game.

01:03:44.426 --> 01:03:45.801
Eddie, you...

01:03:45.926 --> 01:03:48.509
You know you don't have to do this.
I mean, not...

01:03:50.051 --> 01:03:52.301
Not everyone is made for the army.

01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:54.009
I can do it.

01:03:55.551 --> 01:03:57.926
Yes. No, I mean,
I didn't mean it like...

01:04:01.258 --> 01:04:02.883
OK, yeah.
- (Pats Eddie's lap)

01:04:03.008 --> 01:04:04.966
You'll be great.
- (Car door opens)

01:04:06.883 --> 01:04:08.341
(Car door closes)

01:04:10.091 --> 01:04:11.175
(Ian sighs)

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.300
(Man) Five minutes!

01:04:14.133 --> 01:04:17.341
Eddie, stop. We need to talk.
- There's nothing to talk about.

01:04:17.466 --> 01:04:20.216
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
- (Amber) Eddie!

01:04:24.883 --> 01:04:27.883
Jesus, I'm gone one day
and you're back to the war machine.

01:04:29.091 --> 01:04:30.258
Where were you?

01:04:31.091 --> 01:04:32.550
I was sick.

01:04:32.675 --> 01:04:33.840
Period stuff.

01:04:36.965 --> 01:04:38.799
Once your mam calms down,
we can go back to normal.

01:04:40.299 --> 01:04:41.674
To the way it was.

01:04:53.299 --> 01:04:54.340
Let's talk later.

01:04:56.215 --> 01:04:57.215
About?

01:04:57.715 --> 01:04:58.882
Not now.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.840
Good luck.

01:05:03.924 --> 01:05:05.090
(Softly) I love you.

01:05:07.548 --> 01:05:08.881
No one can hear you.

01:05:20.839 --> 01:05:21.923
(Whistle blows)

01:05:22.673 --> 01:05:25.923
(Man) That's good, Kelly. Keep it going.
- (Man 2) Faggot.

01:05:26.048 --> 01:05:28.214
How far up the hole
do you want it?

01:05:28.339 --> 01:05:29.881
Move!
- Come on, Cotter.

01:05:31.339 --> 01:05:32.673
Come on, move it!

01:05:34.881 --> 01:05:36.673
Get up!

01:05:37.423 --> 01:05:39.713
(Intriguing music)

01:06:09.172 --> 01:06:11.087
(Distant animated chatter)

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:17.129
Hi. Uh...

01:06:17.254 --> 01:06:20.837
(Stammering)
Look, I was thinking and...I...

01:06:21.296 --> 01:06:23.337
I think that maybe we should just...

01:06:24.754 --> 01:06:26.921
We should just start
going out properly.

01:06:27.421 --> 01:06:28.421
What?

01:06:29.462 --> 01:06:30.546
No!

01:06:31.879 --> 01:06:35.712
Like Jesus, no!
- (Whispering) What? Sh! Why not?

01:06:35.837 --> 01:06:37.754
Th-This works, OK, it's perfect.

01:06:37.879 --> 01:06:41.129
Eddie, it's not real.
- But it is. It is. No, it is real.

01:06:41.254 --> 01:06:45.295
We just... We just...
Yeah, OK, we skip the sex part, OK?

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:47.170
But most couples stop that anyway.

01:06:48.586 --> 01:06:53.003
I don't want to skip it!
Like, we shouldn't have to skip it.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.128
Amber, please.

01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:57.961
Don't ruin this.

01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:01.253
I'm sorry, Eddie.

01:07:03.503 --> 01:07:04.545
It's over.

01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:10.836
If you want,
you can tell people you ended it.

01:07:13.711 --> 01:07:15.294
That makes sense.

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.794
Sh. Hey!

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:29.835
Why don't we put on some potato waffles?

01:07:31.752 --> 01:07:34.002
Amber dumped him.
- No, I-I dumped her!

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:36.335
(Mouthing)

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.044
I'm sorry, love.

01:07:41.877 --> 01:07:44.710
Look, just remember,
it doesn't matter either way.

01:07:56.709 --> 01:07:59.084
(Opens envelope)

01:08:03.501 --> 01:08:04.543
I got in.

01:08:05.084 --> 01:08:09.043
That's great, honey, that's great.
- (Ian) Wow. Hey!

01:08:10.543 --> 01:08:12.043
Well done.
- Well done.

01:08:12.168 --> 01:08:14.709
That's great.
That's good news.

01:08:22.667 --> 01:08:23.792
Mam.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.042
Please say something.

01:08:32.125 --> 01:08:33.250
That you're...

01:08:36.667 --> 01:08:38.082
Gay.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.375
I don't know
what your father would say.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:51.792
He's not here.

01:08:53.249 --> 01:08:54.582
It's just us.

01:08:58.582 --> 01:09:00.291
I'm not going anywhere.

01:09:21.582 --> 01:09:25.331
(Jack) You're voting for Jesus.
Hey, Eddie, hey! Hey.

01:09:27.706 --> 01:09:29.165
Eddie.
- What?

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:32.040
Amber... Amber... She's a lesbian.

01:09:32.165 --> 01:09:33.540
What?
- Yeah.

01:09:33.665 --> 01:09:36.456
B-But nobody's saying, nobody...

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:43.040
Nobody's saying you made her one.
- Who? Who's saying that?

01:09:43.165 --> 01:09:45.206
A few of... Every... That guy.
- He said it?

01:09:45.331 --> 01:09:46.790
Yeah.
- Why would he say it?

01:09:46.915 --> 01:09:48.665
Like, a lot of people as well.

01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:50.790
Were you... What?
- But I...

01:09:51.831 --> 01:09:53.915
(Sighing) OK. Oh, Jesus.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.165
There, there.

01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:57.664
No, no, OK.

01:09:57.789 --> 01:09:59.455
OK, OK, OK! Let's go.

01:10:00.789 --> 01:10:02.664
(Jack) Eddie...
- (Girls indistinct)

01:10:05.372 --> 01:10:07.039
(Tutting)

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:12.580
(Tracey sighs)

01:10:12.705 --> 01:10:14.664
(Tutting)

01:10:20.539 --> 01:10:21.747
(Muttering) Oh, God.

01:10:25.747 --> 01:10:27.997
(Tutting)

01:10:32.163 --> 01:10:33.496
Did you know?

01:10:34.829 --> 01:10:35.954
(Quietly) No.

01:10:37.288 --> 01:10:39.621
I think she might've
tried it on with me once.

01:10:40.621 --> 01:10:43.579
Like...100% did.

01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:51.329
I'm a good listener.

01:10:53.663 --> 01:10:54.829
Thanks.

01:10:57.829 --> 01:10:59.329
(Tutting)

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:17.287
(Guy) Jesus,
that's the lesbian one, isn't it?

01:11:36.577 --> 01:11:38.244
Jesus, am I glad to see you.

01:11:39.494 --> 01:11:41.619
My mam told Father Jermidy,

01:11:41.744 --> 01:11:44.161
but apparently it needs to be
in the actual box

01:11:44.286 --> 01:11:45.911
in order to be a confession.

01:11:46.036 --> 01:11:47.036
Arsehole.

01:11:48.911 --> 01:11:51.452
Eddie.
- Just get the hell out of my way, dyke!

01:11:56.369 --> 01:11:57.536
Amber...

01:12:08.243 --> 01:12:10.910
Hey, man,
you should really be more sensitive.

01:12:11.826 --> 01:12:15.201
Oh, I should really be more sensitive?
You think that?

01:12:15.326 --> 01:12:18.326
You, Kev, think that
I should really be more sensitive?!

01:12:18.451 --> 01:12:19.576
What the actual fuck?

01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:22.118
Don't tell me to be more sensitive!

01:12:22.243 --> 01:12:23.535
Who, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:30.326
(Sweeney) Kev, you OK?
- (Kev scoffs)

01:12:31.576 --> 01:12:32.951
My office now.

01:12:34.035 --> 01:12:35.368
(Eddie huffing)

01:12:36.326 --> 01:12:37.576
All right, sit down.

01:12:41.034 --> 01:12:43.409
What has gotten into you?
This is not like you.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.450
All right, look...

01:12:50.534 --> 01:12:52.034
I know how you must feel.

01:12:53.242 --> 01:12:55.742
You do?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure I do.

01:13:03.034 --> 01:13:04.117
W-What the hell?

01:13:04.242 --> 01:13:06.909
Y-You said that you knew how I feel!
- To be a teenager.

01:13:07.034 --> 01:13:10.367
(Sighing) Shit, I...
- No, I've got a fiancÃ©e, I'm straight.

01:13:10.492 --> 01:13:13.324
(Stammering) I didn't mean it. I didn't.
- Oh, fuck.

01:13:13.449 --> 01:13:16.158
OK, was the door open?
The code says it has to be open.

01:13:16.283 --> 01:13:17.449
It was, but I was joking!

01:13:17.574 --> 01:13:21.783
You're nearest to the door, I'm not
blocking you. This is a safe space.

01:13:21.908 --> 01:13:24.949
The safest. Real safe, so safe.
- A safe place.

01:13:25.074 --> 01:13:27.741
But it was a joke, though. I was joking!
- Shit, Eddie!

01:13:27.866 --> 01:13:29.449
Why did you do that?

01:13:29.574 --> 01:13:32.408
I've got a 30-year mortgage
with a lady!

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:35.741
With a lady, Eddie. With a lady!
- Just don't tell anyone.

01:13:35.866 --> 01:13:39.158
Why did you do that? Why?
- I know, I'm sorry.

01:13:39.824 --> 01:13:40.783
Oh, fuck!

01:13:50.198 --> 01:13:52.198
(Eddie cries out) Fuck!

01:13:53.448 --> 01:13:56.240
Who the fuck
are you calling a dyke?

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:58.032
Why did you have to ruin this?

01:13:58.157 --> 01:14:00.615
It was never going to last forever!
- But why not?

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.073
Because!

01:14:02.198 --> 01:14:05.740
I want pussy and you want cock,
it is a fundamental obstacle!

01:14:05.865 --> 01:14:06.907
Shit!

01:14:10.032 --> 01:14:12.157
You can come out too.
- (Softly) No.

01:14:12.282 --> 01:14:13.823
No, I'm happy as I am.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.656
So, what,
you just join the regiment

01:14:17.781 --> 01:14:20.156
and stay here and be miserable?!

01:14:22.739 --> 01:14:24.406
It's better than being a faggot.

01:14:27.614 --> 01:14:29.572
It's not about other people, Eddie.

01:14:30.364 --> 01:14:31.406
It's about you.

01:14:40.156 --> 01:14:42.906
(Church bell rings)
- (Indistinct chatter)

01:14:58.571 --> 01:14:59.863
I'm ready to talk.

01:15:02.988 --> 01:15:04.613
I assumed you would.

01:15:14.446 --> 01:15:15.863
She broke my heart.

01:15:20.321 --> 01:15:22.695
She was the first girl
that I ever slept with.

01:15:24.237 --> 01:15:25.570
My God.

01:15:25.695 --> 01:15:27.612
Lesbians are fierce sluts.

01:15:29.779 --> 01:15:31.695
I don't know
if I'll ever love again.

01:15:46.779 --> 01:15:48.695
(Heavy breathing)

01:15:59.486 --> 01:16:00.903
(Distorted) Eddie.

01:16:02.986 --> 01:16:04.486
(Clears his throat)

01:16:14.194 --> 01:16:15.611
(Door closes)

01:16:17.653 --> 01:16:18.819
Mam.

01:16:19.319 --> 01:16:21.736
This is Sarah.
- Hello, Sarah, nice to meet you.

01:16:22.319 --> 01:16:23.361
You too.

01:16:23.819 --> 01:16:25.111
Oh!
- (Nervous laughter)

01:16:28.652 --> 01:16:30.735
Right, so, that's that.
(Nervous chuckle)

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:36.027
I hope you like chicken Kiev.
- (Awkward laughter)

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.318
I'm... I'm actually vegetarian.

01:16:43.902 --> 01:16:46.443
(Bell rings)
- (Students cheering)

01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:56.527
Amber! Sign my shirt.

01:17:02.734 --> 01:17:05.026
Sorry for all the stick,
but it's in the past now.

01:17:05.651 --> 01:17:07.234
It was last week.
- Ah.

01:17:08.526 --> 01:17:09.776
Exactly.

01:17:14.859 --> 01:17:17.484
(Sombre instrumental)

01:17:39.775 --> 01:17:41.858
(Music continues)

01:17:48.108 --> 01:17:49.900
(Music fades)

01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:52.733
Oh...- (Soft rock song playing)

01:17:54.066 --> 01:17:55.108
Shit.

01:17:56.983 --> 01:17:58.275
Was it OK?

01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:15.690
My turn.

01:18:39.939 --> 01:18:41.731
(Song stops)

01:18:41.856 --> 01:18:45.106
(Kev) Sex, have you heard of it?
Be open about it.

01:18:45.231 --> 01:18:47.314
Will you stop talking about
our sex life?!

01:18:47.439 --> 01:18:49.439
(Kev) You must be open
about these things.

01:18:49.564 --> 01:18:52.314
You were open when I stuck my finger
up your arsehole!

01:18:52.439 --> 01:18:54.231
(Kev) Oh my God, that was one time!

01:18:54.356 --> 01:18:56.981
That was one time!
- Is that even good, though?

01:18:57.106 --> 01:19:00.814
(Kev) It was actually quite nice,
but that's not the point!

01:19:00.939 --> 01:19:02.606
She shouldn't bring that up!

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.813
(Intriguing music)

01:19:16.188 --> 01:19:18.813
Drink?
- (Softly) Uh, yeah...

01:19:20.313 --> 01:19:21.522
Do you want something?

01:19:30.147 --> 01:19:31.480
(Sniffles)

01:19:46.354 --> 01:19:47.729
Just because we feel...

01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:51.104
You know...

01:19:53.062 --> 01:19:54.896
It doesn't mean
that we have to be.

01:19:55.646 --> 01:19:56.646
Right.

01:19:59.562 --> 01:20:01.271
We can just move on.

01:20:03.604 --> 01:20:05.104
And live a normal life.

01:20:07.437 --> 01:20:08.896
We can be happy.

01:20:19.061 --> 01:20:20.478
How's the couch?

01:20:22.103 --> 01:20:23.353
It's OK.

01:20:23.895 --> 01:20:25.186
A bit tough on my back.

01:20:30.186 --> 01:20:32.103
Ian, are we shit parents?

01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:34.436
No.

01:20:34.978 --> 01:20:36.311
No, I mean...

01:20:36.936 --> 01:20:39.395
I'd say we're in the top 50% maybe.

01:20:40.353 --> 01:20:43.270
It's not that bad, actually.
- No, it's fine.

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:47.894
I'd say there's...much worse.

01:20:48.019 --> 01:20:49.685
Yeah. Yeah...

01:20:53.144 --> 01:20:54.269
(Softly) OK.

01:20:54.394 --> 01:20:56.144
I'm going to turn down the station.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.227
I'm not gonna go.

01:21:06.019 --> 01:21:08.102
Hannah, are we gonna get through this?

01:21:11.769 --> 01:21:13.144
I dunno.

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.393
I hope so.

01:21:20.684 --> 01:21:22.018
I really do.

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.976
(Sombre music)

01:21:44.434 --> 01:21:47.476
How long is Eddie going away for?
- Six weeks.

01:21:47.601 --> 01:21:49.393
(Janet) He'll be all buff and sexy.

01:21:49.518 --> 01:21:52.517
Once he's done, we can get
a place in the barracks for nothing.

01:21:52.642 --> 01:21:54.308
Jesus, a soldier's wife.

01:21:54.433 --> 01:21:56.975
Has he gone already?
- Can you shampoo Mr Keller.

01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.350
Did you just...?

01:21:58.475 --> 01:22:00.308
You missed your shot.
- Exactly.

01:22:00.433 --> 01:22:01.267
When's he going?

01:22:01.392 --> 01:22:02.808
Today.
- None of your bus...

01:22:02.933 --> 01:22:04.933
None of your business.
- I need help here.

01:22:05.058 --> 01:22:07.850
(Both) We're on a smoke break.
- Fucking idiot.

01:22:09.892 --> 01:22:11.350
(Knocking on door)

01:22:12.433 --> 01:22:13.517
How are you getting on?

01:22:14.433 --> 01:22:15.433
Nearly done.

01:22:26.682 --> 01:22:28.224
I remember when you were tiny.

01:22:29.266 --> 01:22:31.141
I used to have to sit here all night

01:22:31.266 --> 01:22:32.932
and watch you fall asleep.

01:22:33.057 --> 01:22:35.307
It couldn't be your dad,
it had to be me.

01:22:38.057 --> 01:22:40.266
Your dad brought up
this old armchair

01:22:40.391 --> 01:22:44.016
so I could be a bit more comfortable
and...I would just...

01:22:45.307 --> 01:22:46.391
...watch you sleep.

01:22:47.724 --> 01:22:49.099
Night after night.

01:22:52.516 --> 01:22:54.349
You were so beautiful.

01:23:00.015 --> 01:23:02.598
You know
you can tell me...anything.

01:23:03.848 --> 01:23:05.390
Right?

01:23:05.515 --> 01:23:08.015
And I will love you
no matter what.

01:23:13.348 --> 01:23:16.015
(Sombre music)
- I know.

01:23:18.681 --> 01:23:19.765
OK.

01:23:21.848 --> 01:23:23.390
Well, you ready?

01:23:45.805 --> 01:23:47.889
(Music builds)

01:23:51.889 --> 01:23:53.722
OK. (Sniffles)

01:23:53.847 --> 01:23:55.555
OK, you have everything?
- Yeah.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:57.222
Phone card?
- Yeah.

01:23:57.347 --> 01:23:59.389
Make sure to ring us, yeah?
- Promise.

01:24:10.096 --> 01:24:11.804
I'm so proud of you.

01:24:12.638 --> 01:24:15.596
Forty minutes.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:24:17.513 --> 01:24:19.888
(Indistinct chatter)
- (Music continues)

01:24:40.845 --> 01:24:43.553
(Girl) So...
Are you gonna let us in or...?

01:24:45.387 --> 01:24:46.595
No.

01:24:57.012 --> 01:24:59.470
(Music builds)

01:25:07.052 --> 01:25:10.552
(Man, distant) Sign your name.
Take your bag. Get on the truck.

01:25:14.094 --> 01:25:15.594
Have you signed your name?

01:25:15.719 --> 01:25:19.136
Sign your name.
Take your bag. Get on the truck.

01:25:28.094 --> 01:25:30.136
Bus is moving in five minutes!

01:25:30.261 --> 01:25:32.969
Everybody, get on the trucks
right behind me!

01:25:47.176 --> 01:25:48.801
Stop throwing rocks at people!

01:25:49.718 --> 01:25:50.926
Here.

01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:55.760
Why?
- Take it!

01:25:56.593 --> 01:25:59.510
It's over 2,000,
it is enough to get out of here.

01:25:59.635 --> 01:26:00.676
Out of Ireland.

01:26:00.801 --> 01:26:02.510
No, I don't want it.
- Yes, you do!

01:26:02.635 --> 01:26:04.051
I'm happy here.
- You're not!

01:26:04.176 --> 01:26:05.760
I am.
- No, you're not!

01:26:06.468 --> 01:26:08.218
And you're not going to be!

01:26:10.343 --> 01:26:11.967
This place will kill you.

01:26:15.884 --> 01:26:17.717
Please, Eddie, just take it.

01:26:18.675 --> 01:26:21.175
You can't be
who you need to be here.

01:26:25.842 --> 01:26:27.425
Where am I supposed to go?

01:26:29.175 --> 01:26:30.425
Anywhere.

01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:34.092
You should come with me.

01:26:36.384 --> 01:26:37.675
I can't.

01:26:40.009 --> 01:26:41.925
You have to do this
on your own.

01:26:43.591 --> 01:26:44.966
I'm scared.

01:26:45.716 --> 01:26:46.883
You should be.

01:26:47.633 --> 01:26:49.091
Fucking scary.

01:26:52.216 --> 01:26:53.591
You'll be great.

01:26:54.966 --> 01:26:56.299
I taught you well.

01:27:01.091 --> 01:27:02.466
(Voice breaking) I can't.

01:27:03.424 --> 01:27:04.758
I can't.

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:11.508
(Truck starts)

01:27:13.216 --> 01:27:15.673
(Man, distant) Come on, move!
The truck is leaving!

01:27:15.798 --> 01:27:17.132
Last call!

01:27:17.632 --> 01:27:18.632
Amber...

01:27:29.965 --> 01:27:31.507
(Sniffles)

01:27:32.673 --> 01:27:33.923
I'm gay.

01:27:39.923 --> 01:27:40.965
No shit (!)

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:44.673
I'm sorry
I was such a prick to you.

01:27:46.007 --> 01:27:47.090
No.

01:27:51.339 --> 01:27:55.214
You are the ONLY boy in the world
I'm glad I dated.

01:27:56.589 --> 01:27:57.881
Go.

01:28:03.089 --> 01:28:05.339
(Slow, uplifting music)

01:28:36.255 --> 01:28:38.171
(Music continues)

01:29:25.461 --> 01:29:28.753
(Music fades away)

01:29:32.169 --> 01:29:34.211
(# 202s: "Shoot you Down")

01:29:52.919 --> 01:29:56.003
# Do you remember when it seemed

01:29:56.128 --> 01:29:59.335
# That your dreams could be so real

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:02.668
# Do you remember when you believed

01:30:02.793 --> 01:30:06.043
# In everything that you could achieve

01:30:06.168 --> 01:30:09.418
# Now you've lost that look in your eye

01:30:09.543 --> 01:30:12.793
# And you don't hold your head so high

01:30:12.918 --> 01:30:15.918
# Precious memory all around

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:19.377
# Don't let them shoot you,
shoot you down

01:30:19.502 --> 01:30:22.710
# Don't let them shoot you,
shoot you down

01:30:22.835 --> 01:30:26.043
# Don't let them shoot you,
shoot you down... #
