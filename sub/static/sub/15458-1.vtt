02:25.300 --> 02:26.420
Maman!

02:34.340 --> 02:36.860
Cecile, darling.

02:37.220 --> 02:40.460
Cecile, do you remember Madame de Merteuil?

02:43.500 --> 02:45.380
Why, yes, of course.

02:47.820 --> 02:50.380
What a beautiful young lady.

02:51.220 --> 02:54.460
The last time I saw you,
you were just a little girl.

02:57.820 --> 03:00.620
Madame, is it true that I'm getting married?

03:02.100 --> 03:04.300
Who told you that?

03:04.500 --> 03:06.860
Everybody's been talking about it.

03:07.540 --> 03:11.060
I'm not supposed to say anything...

03:11.700 --> 03:14.340
but yes, it's true.

03:16.020 --> 03:18.980
- To whom?
- I can't say.

03:19.020 --> 03:22.740
- Please, Madame, please.
- I mean, I don't know.

03:23.860 --> 03:26.500
Your mother's been so secretive about it.

03:26.820 --> 03:30.620
But can you try and find out, please?

03:35.660 --> 03:40.220
<i>It's really sweet to see Cecile
so excited about her marriage.</i>

03:40.300 --> 03:43.380
Yes, she's excited, very excited.

03:43.980 --> 03:46.900
- It almost has me worried.
- Why?

03:48.740 --> 03:52.020
She's been at that convent since she was 11.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.860
She's so innocent, so unprepared.

03:55.940 --> 03:58.740
As long as her husband doesn't mind.

03:58.820 --> 04:02.740
On the contrary.
He seems obsessed by her purity, virginity.

04:02.980 --> 04:04.220
Who is he?

04:04.420 --> 04:08.500
It was he who suggested
that she stay at the convent till the wedding.

04:09.380 --> 04:12.940
That's very thoughtful.
I like this in a man.

04:13.180 --> 04:14.460
Who is he?

04:15.660 --> 04:16.980
I'd rather not say.

04:17.579 --> 04:20.060
I agreed to let him make the announcement.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.860
I see.

04:22.380 --> 04:26.180
My dear, I'd love you
to spend some time with Cecile.

04:26.220 --> 04:28.580
She could learn so much from you.

04:29.380 --> 04:33.420
I want her to enter this marriage
as innocent as she is...

04:34.500 --> 04:36.420
and as wise as you are.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.500
You flatter me.

05:16.020 --> 05:17.180
Cecile.

05:19.180 --> 05:21.180
Do you see how I hold my fan?

05:24.340 --> 05:25.380
Yes.

05:30.260 --> 05:32.460
- Vicomte.
- Madame.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.700
Mademoiselle.

05:44.860 --> 05:47.620
Won't you introduce me
to your enchanting friend?

05:48.060 --> 05:51.620
Cecile, if you allow your hand
to be held too long...

05:51.660 --> 05:54.300
men will take it as an encouragement.

05:57.260 --> 05:59.580
Is this your first opera, mademoiselle?

06:01.900 --> 06:03.460
Should I answer?

06:05.260 --> 06:07.780
If you do answer...

06:07.980 --> 06:10.580
a man will take it as an invitation.

06:10.740 --> 06:14.860
If you don't,
a gentleman will know he should leave.

06:18.540 --> 06:20.220
So what should I do?

06:21.100 --> 06:22.900
What do you want to do?

06:26.860 --> 06:28.900
Yes, this is my first opera.

06:29.740 --> 06:33.420
- I've never been to one before.
- Do you do any singing yourself?

06:33.460 --> 06:37.700
Monsieur de Valmont,
may I have a word with you, please?

06:43.980 --> 06:48.060
That young lady is the daughter of my cousin...

06:48.300 --> 06:50.100
Madame de Volanges.

06:50.780 --> 06:54.540
She's about to get married,
and she's under my protection.

06:54.980 --> 06:56.780
So you keep away from her.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.980
How old did you say she was?

06:59.500 --> 07:02.300
Fifteen, you monster.

07:02.380 --> 07:06.100
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm going to leave Paris for a while.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.860
Where are you going?

07:08.300 --> 07:10.220
Do you really want to know?

07:10.300 --> 07:12.260
If you want to tell me.

07:12.980 --> 07:14.980
I'm going to visit my old aunt.

07:15.020 --> 07:17.060
Your old aunt.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.100
My old aunt, yes.

07:20.820 --> 07:23.060
How old is your old aunt?

07:24.620 --> 07:26.980
You know her, Madame de Rosemonde.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.900
Madame de Rosemonde is still alive?

07:30.220 --> 07:33.780
So if you get bored with playing chaperon,
you'll know where to find me.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.740
And if you come, I'll be very happy.

07:37.340 --> 07:38.620
Very happy.

07:43.060 --> 07:45.580
Give my love to Madame de Rosemonde.

07:55.820 --> 07:57.100
Who was that?

07:58.060 --> 08:02.660
Cecile, that man is very bad
for a young lady's reputation.

08:03.420 --> 08:06.380
Your mother shouldn't even know
he was in our box.

08:07.340 --> 08:08.900
Is he your lover?

08:10.700 --> 08:11.980
Cecile...

08:13.700 --> 08:16.300
One doesn't ask questions like that.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.940
Certainly not of a widow.

08:20.780 --> 08:22.540
Widows don't have lovers?

08:23.460 --> 08:26.140
No, they don't.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.460
More.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.340
More?

08:53.860 --> 08:55.180
I want more.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.700
Then...

08:57.900 --> 09:01.380
you might have to find yourself
another lover.

09:02.540 --> 09:03.700
No.

09:06.260 --> 09:09.420
I'm very happy with the one I have.

09:10.820 --> 09:12.900
You're not bored yet?

09:14.420 --> 09:16.300
Unspeakably bored.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.540
When shall I see you again?

09:23.860 --> 09:25.020
Monday?

09:26.820 --> 09:29.020
Monday. I can't.

09:31.060 --> 09:34.020
- Tuesday?
- Tuesday...

09:35.620 --> 09:37.220
I'm afraid not.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.300
Wednesday?

09:47.340 --> 09:49.300
I'll have to let you know.

09:51.820 --> 09:54.180
Are you seeing somebody else?

09:57.260 --> 09:58.700
Of course not.

10:16.460 --> 10:18.140
Good afternoon, Madame.

10:50.020 --> 10:54.180
No, it's A in the right hand, not B-flat.

11:04.900 --> 11:08.140
- Madame!
- No. Don't stop.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.940
This is...

11:18.100 --> 11:19.540
I'm sorry.

11:19.620 --> 11:22.220
- Chevalier de Danceny.
- Yes, Danceny.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.420
He's giving me my music lessons.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.940
- Nervous?
- Madame, feel my heart.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.940
Don't be silly.
Everyone will love your singing.

11:37.220 --> 11:38.620
That's not it.

11:41.180 --> 11:43.980
It's my husband, my fiance.

11:44.060 --> 11:48.060
I know he's going to be there.
I know my mother's invited him.

11:53.140 --> 11:55.460
Can you try and find out who he is?

11:56.980 --> 11:58.140
Please?

12:20.900 --> 12:22.100
My dear.

12:23.940 --> 12:26.140
Cecile is so nervous. Poor thing.

12:26.180 --> 12:29.500
She believes that her fiance
is here today. Is he?

12:29.580 --> 12:33.220
See? How does she know that?
She's so clever.

12:33.260 --> 12:36.100
- I never told her anything.
- Which one is he?

12:36.140 --> 12:38.860
- You'll keep it to yourself?
- Of course.

12:38.940 --> 12:41.020
Come. I'll introduce you, but...

12:42.740 --> 12:44.660
Why is he so secretive?

12:45.020 --> 12:48.500
I think he has a mistress,
and he's having trouble getting rid of her.

12:48.580 --> 12:50.300
I heard she's a little...

12:51.100 --> 12:52.260
I understand.

12:54.180 --> 12:58.580
Monsieur de Gercourt, may I introduce you
to Madame de Merteuil?

13:02.340 --> 13:04.940
You two know one another?

13:09.900 --> 13:11.300
Do we?

13:13.740 --> 13:15.660
If you remember that we do, madame...

13:15.740 --> 13:19.140
then your memory must be better than mine.

13:21.820 --> 13:23.980
Then I suppose that we don't.

13:31.580 --> 13:34.580
You couldn't have made
a better choice, my dear.

13:37.020 --> 13:41.140
<i>A knight riding through the glade</i>

13:41.340 --> 13:43.820
<i>Chanced on a pretty maid</i>

13:44.220 --> 13:46.500
<i>And as the sunlight played</i>

13:46.540 --> 13:49.860
<i>He wooed the pretty lady</i>

13:50.980 --> 13:55.740
<i>'Sir, go thy way,' the maiden replied</i>

13:56.540 --> 14:01.220
<i>'My lord came today to make me his bride</i>

14:01.900 --> 14:06.620
<i>'There are others, other roses</i>

14:07.340 --> 14:12.060
<i>'Leave me to my lord and go'</i>

14:12.100 --> 14:17.020
<i>Now, he did not believe it true</i>

14:17.100 --> 14:19.940
<i>Swore he would win the maid</i>

14:20.140 --> 14:22.260
<i>But her lord came and slew</i>

14:22.500 --> 14:26.260
<i>Both knight and pretty lady</i>

14:26.980 --> 14:29.940
<i>Friends, though your rose be so fair...</i>

14:30.020 --> 14:31.620
She's so adorable.

14:33.020 --> 14:34.940
I can't even feel jealous.

14:37.140 --> 14:39.860
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.180
Thank you.

14:45.580 --> 14:46.820
Lovely.

15:05.860 --> 15:07.860
Is she...

15:09.100 --> 15:11.740
Just resting, sir. Just resting.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.500
- Shall I...
- No.

15:16.420 --> 15:18.300
Let's take it out.

16:29.580 --> 16:31.180
Is it my turn?

16:33.460 --> 16:35.100
Do you remember me?

16:37.260 --> 16:39.580
Of course I remember you.

16:40.780 --> 16:45.540
- Just jog my memory a little.
- I'm Madame de Merteuil.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.820
Of course you are, my dear.

16:48.900 --> 16:52.020
- I just arrived.
- I know you've just arrived.

16:56.020 --> 16:57.620
Where is my table?

17:02.540 --> 17:03.740
Where is everybody?

17:11.660 --> 17:12.980
Sir.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.300
There she is.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.940
Give me a push.

17:52.860 --> 17:54.940
May I invite you for a ride?

17:55.020 --> 17:57.180
No, you may not.

17:57.220 --> 17:59.340
- Why not?
- I can't swim.

17:59.420 --> 18:00.740
Neither can I.

18:00.820 --> 18:03.780
No. My husband, he would never forgive me
if I drowned.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.020
- Where is your husband, madame?
- He's in Rouen.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.940
- You live in Rouen?
- No. We live in Paris.

18:10.020 --> 18:13.340
My husband is a judge
and he has an important case in Rouen.

18:14.100 --> 18:16.500
Do you love your husband, madame?

18:16.580 --> 18:18.940
Yes, I love him very much.

18:19.020 --> 18:22.540
- So why aren't you with him?
- Because I'm visiting your aunt.

18:23.020 --> 18:27.580
Besides, when my husband works on
important cases he prefers to be alone.

18:27.660 --> 18:31.460
- Does he often work on important cases?
- Yes, quite often.

18:33.460 --> 18:37.220
- Then you must be an exceptional woman.
- No, it's...

18:37.860 --> 18:41.900
- Not exceptional. Why?
- To love a husband who's never there.

18:41.980 --> 18:44.700
- Are you married, Monsieur de Valmont?
- No.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.420
I'm in love.

18:48.780 --> 18:51.060
- You're in love.
- Yes.

18:51.620 --> 18:54.780
- Then why aren't you with her?
- I am with her.

18:55.580 --> 18:57.620
I'm talking to her right now.

19:02.220 --> 19:05.340
- You shouldn't have said that.
- Why not? Is it wrong to be in love?

19:05.380 --> 19:08.540
No, as long as the feeling's
mutual and legitimate.

19:09.260 --> 19:11.940
Does that mean you don't love me?

19:13.700 --> 19:16.380
Of course I don't love you.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.660
Don't do that!

19:29.420 --> 19:31.100
Monsieur de Valmont!

19:40.140 --> 19:42.300
Monsieur de Valmont, please!

19:50.540 --> 19:53.020
Don't do that. You frightened me.

19:53.220 --> 19:56.540
What does it matter if I drown?
You don't love me.

19:56.620 --> 20:00.460
Look, sometimes my friends
tell me I'm naive, but...

20:01.660 --> 20:04.900
I'm not so silly that I don't see
what you want.

20:05.220 --> 20:08.020
Yes? What do I want?

20:08.660 --> 20:11.860
If you don't stop talking that way,
we can't be friends.

20:12.060 --> 20:14.700
All I want is to be near you...

20:14.780 --> 20:18.900
and to hear you telling me over and over again
that you don't love me at all.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.220
No.

20:21.740 --> 20:24.580
No, I'm not clever enough to talk to you.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.260
Help!

20:37.020 --> 20:38.180
Help me!

20:40.220 --> 20:41.340
Help me!

20:56.420 --> 20:58.460
Help! Help!

21:19.500 --> 21:20.780
Vicomte.

21:23.860 --> 21:25.380
What happened?

21:26.220 --> 21:27.580
An accident.

21:28.780 --> 21:30.300
So you did come.

21:31.380 --> 21:33.460
Thank you, Azolan.
I won't be needing you.

21:33.700 --> 21:35.220
Yes, he will.

21:35.300 --> 21:38.340
Prepare his traveling clothes
and pack the rest.

21:38.980 --> 21:41.500
- We're going to Paris.
- Wait.

21:42.020 --> 21:43.100
Wait.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.940
- Why?
- I need you in Paris...

21:47.140 --> 21:48.580
very much.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.220
You may go.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.220
What is it?

22:01.340 --> 22:05.780
You remember my little cousin
from the opera?

22:05.860 --> 22:06.940
Yes.

22:07.260 --> 22:10.220
- You remember she's getting married?
- Yes.

22:12.820 --> 22:14.420
Guess to whom.

22:17.060 --> 22:18.620
How could I guess?

22:20.900 --> 22:22.780
Monsieur de Gercourt.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.660
Where do I fit in?

22:36.340 --> 22:38.180
You're the only one who can help me.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.420
Do you want me to challenge him to a duel?

22:45.300 --> 22:48.500
Vicomte, for what I have in mind...

22:48.860 --> 22:51.020
I need you very much alive.

22:51.940 --> 22:54.580
You know, little Cecile...

22:58.980 --> 23:02.540
She reminds me so much of myself
when I was 15.

23:03.660 --> 23:07.540
She's naive, innocent...

23:10.220 --> 23:11.540
pure.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.340
Yes?

23:19.460 --> 23:21.820
I want you to put an end to it.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.100
I want you to take her virginity.

23:32.100 --> 23:35.340
I want Gercourt to discover
on his wedding night...

23:35.660 --> 23:38.340
that he didn't get there first.

23:39.580 --> 23:43.540
I want to make him the laughingstock of Paris.

23:48.900 --> 23:52.220
You want me to seduce a little girl...

23:53.140 --> 23:54.740
who's seen nothing...

23:55.180 --> 23:56.580
who knows nothing...

23:57.260 --> 24:00.740
who'll probably flop on her back
out of simple curiosity?

24:01.700 --> 24:04.700
You don't need me for that.
Anyone can do that.

24:06.660 --> 24:10.660
But I thought you liked her.
I thought I was doing you a favor.

24:11.020 --> 24:14.300
Besides, I can't go to Paris now.

24:15.420 --> 24:19.500
- Why?
- The air here is so fresh.

24:20.300 --> 24:24.220
And you hear the birds singing.
You never hear the birds in Paris.

24:28.380 --> 24:29.380
Who is she?

24:38.660 --> 24:41.020
May I change the subject, madame?

24:41.340 --> 24:43.980
Change anything you want, my dear.

24:44.260 --> 24:46.140
Do you love your husband?

24:51.980 --> 24:53.020
Yes.

24:55.380 --> 24:57.540
Yes, I love him very much.

24:58.220 --> 25:00.100
Then why are you here?

25:00.900 --> 25:02.780
Why aren't you with him?

25:04.820 --> 25:09.700
I'm afraid the Marquise and I
share the same banal curiosity.

25:10.220 --> 25:13.700
Seems that Madame de Tourvel's husband
prefers to be alone when he works.

25:15.820 --> 25:19.980
Men always say they prefer to be alone,
but I love my husband.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.860
So, I go where he goes.

25:22.860 --> 25:25.540
- Out of love?
- Why else?

25:27.900 --> 25:29.180
Fear, maybe?

25:29.780 --> 25:31.500
Fear? Of what?

25:33.100 --> 25:37.020
- That you might be tempted.
- You mean, I might be tempted.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.140
Shush, my love.

25:41.020 --> 25:44.180
Are you hinting that I could be
unfaithful to my husband?

25:44.580 --> 25:48.380
Not now, but, if you were alone...

25:49.020 --> 25:53.340
Monsieur de Valmont,
you simply don't understand women.

25:53.420 --> 25:54.780
You're right.

25:55.340 --> 25:58.940
If a woman wants a little adventure,
she doesn't need to be alone.

25:59.020 --> 26:02.940
She can manage it perfectly well
right under her husband's nose.

26:04.340 --> 26:06.180
Isn't that true, madame?

26:08.500 --> 26:11.100
That's not at all what I meant, madame.

26:14.820 --> 26:18.820
Monsieur de Valmont,
I know some women might be weak...

26:19.180 --> 26:20.260
but...

26:21.340 --> 26:23.740
believe me, there are women
who will always be true.

26:23.860 --> 26:25.060
Nonsense!

26:25.420 --> 26:28.020
A true woman is a contradiction in terms.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.300
Not always.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.700
I believe that some women stay true.

26:37.100 --> 26:39.020
I find them fascinating.

26:41.260 --> 26:43.100
Men usually do.

26:43.980 --> 26:45.260
I've noticed that.

26:47.460 --> 26:48.820
Why is that?

26:50.420 --> 26:53.540
Because men are always chasing
after visions, my dear.

26:53.580 --> 26:55.860
They want us to be angels.

26:56.220 --> 26:59.580
But in bed, they want us
to be demons, my dear.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.380
Yes, indeed.

27:01.420 --> 27:05.540
But there always comes that morning surprise...

27:06.060 --> 27:09.540
when you wake up in the arms
of an ordinary woman.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.500
Do you agree, Vicomte?

27:14.580 --> 27:16.940
I believed that for a long time.

27:17.380 --> 27:20.300
- And you don't anymore?
- No.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.900
It seems to me, Vicomte,
that you believe one thing in Paris...

27:24.940 --> 27:26.660
and another in the country.

27:27.140 --> 27:31.740
Maybe I believe one thing when I'm in love
and another when I'm not in love.

27:31.820 --> 27:35.100
There's something I've been wondering
about all evening.

27:36.100 --> 27:39.140
If you had your choice
of all the ladies present...

27:39.940 --> 27:42.500
in whose arms would you spend the night?

27:45.140 --> 27:48.260
No. That's not fair to Monsieur de Valmont.

27:48.340 --> 27:49.900
The question is...

27:49.980 --> 27:54.740
which one of you ladies
would like to spend the night with him?

28:02.860 --> 28:04.260
We all would?

28:04.780 --> 28:06.580
Not me.

28:07.340 --> 28:08.860
Not me.

28:17.180 --> 28:20.060
I don't think the question is worth answering.

28:22.780 --> 28:25.700
I suppose that just leaves me.

28:35.460 --> 28:38.220
- Good night.
- Good night.

28:51.060 --> 28:52.340
Valmont...

28:52.820 --> 28:54.580
You disappoint me.

28:55.340 --> 28:58.940
That's what's keeping you here? Tell me.

28:59.660 --> 29:01.900
Are you really falling in love?

29:02.140 --> 29:04.020
Would that make you jealous?

29:04.100 --> 29:05.540
Not really.

29:07.660 --> 29:11.340
- Why not?
- Because you're wasting your time.

29:11.660 --> 29:15.140
- I don't think so.
- You'll never have her.

29:15.660 --> 29:17.340
What do you want to wager?

29:19.540 --> 29:21.140
Anything you want.

29:23.860 --> 29:25.060
You.

29:25.740 --> 29:27.100
Your body.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.500
And if you lose?

29:32.300 --> 29:33.940
Anything you want.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.180
I want you to...

29:40.180 --> 29:44.940
shut yourself in a monastery,
anoint yourself with ashes...

29:45.580 --> 29:48.220
and repent for all your sins.

29:48.860 --> 29:50.060
I accept.

29:51.980 --> 29:54.180
Good night, my little monk.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.340
I'm afraid you'll be very lonely.

30:00.140 --> 30:02.860
Remember me in your prayers sometime.

30:27.060 --> 30:30.700
You know, I keep thinking about
one thing you said at dinner.

30:31.540 --> 30:33.860
I said so many things.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.740
It had to do with your husband's nose.

30:39.700 --> 30:42.140
And I thought you weren't interested.

30:55.540 --> 30:58.260
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you desperately.

30:58.340 --> 31:00.740
- Why? What happened?
- It's horrible.

31:00.820 --> 31:03.180
- It's Cecile.
- What?

31:03.220 --> 31:04.300
Come.

31:09.940 --> 31:14.100
Did I show you the cabinet I gave Cecile?

31:14.860 --> 31:16.980
It's an exquisite piece.

31:18.260 --> 31:23.020
I told her,
"You can lock all your secrets in there."

31:24.140 --> 31:26.020
Do you know what she said?

31:26.900 --> 31:31.220
"Maman, you know it will never be locked."

31:33.420 --> 31:37.180
Isn't that the sweetest thing
a daughter can say to a mother?

31:39.500 --> 31:41.100
Yes.

31:41.820 --> 31:43.300
It's locked.

31:43.940 --> 31:46.900
- I have a duplicate key, of course.
- Of course.

31:47.180 --> 31:49.260
So I looked inside.

31:49.300 --> 31:51.380
Do you know what I found?

31:52.700 --> 31:55.620
Letters. Love letters.

31:56.460 --> 31:59.660
- From...
- From her miserable music teacher.

32:00.820 --> 32:04.020
- That little boy?
- That little snake!

32:04.540 --> 32:06.060
What did you do?

32:10.140 --> 32:11.620
I didn't do anything.

32:12.300 --> 32:15.620
Cecile doesn't even know
I've read the letters.

32:16.980 --> 32:19.780
I don't want her to know I have a key.

32:20.820 --> 32:24.660
- Does her fiance know about this?
- Of course not.

32:26.620 --> 32:29.620
Why don't I talk to her
and see what I can find out?

32:31.020 --> 32:32.020
Yes?

32:34.780 --> 32:35.980
Cecile.

32:36.180 --> 32:39.820
Madame! Where have you been?
I've missed you.

32:40.060 --> 32:42.780
How beautiful you look!

32:43.220 --> 32:44.500
Thank you.

32:45.700 --> 32:48.300
We must go to the opera again sometime.

32:48.900 --> 32:52.940
I'd love to.
It was so wonderful to see all that.

32:53.140 --> 32:56.020
And those chandeliers and the music.

32:56.100 --> 32:59.700
You should ask your music teacher
to teach you some songs from the opera.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.060
I'll do that.

33:02.460 --> 33:04.820
You happy with your music teacher?

33:05.540 --> 33:07.900
He's a wonderful teacher, and...

33:11.060 --> 33:12.060
Yes?

33:13.620 --> 33:15.380
I can't tell you.

33:18.540 --> 33:19.740
Cecile...

33:20.500 --> 33:22.380
if we're to be friends...

33:22.740 --> 33:25.540
we must trust each other completely.

33:28.140 --> 33:30.340
He's been writing me letters.

33:31.100 --> 33:32.460
Has he?

33:34.100 --> 33:36.500
He writes so beautifully, madame.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.860
What does he say?

33:39.700 --> 33:41.420
I don't know, really.

33:41.980 --> 33:43.940
He has all these feelings.

33:44.860 --> 33:46.180
He's sad.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.740
He has longings.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.980
Do you love him, Cecile?

33:51.700 --> 33:53.540
No, I don't.

33:55.860 --> 33:57.580
So, should I answer him?

33:58.380 --> 34:00.140
If you don't love him...

34:00.420 --> 34:03.260
it would be very wrong to encourage him.

34:07.700 --> 34:09.540
But, madame, I lied.

34:10.060 --> 34:13.699
I lied to you. I do love him.
I'm so in love.

34:18.580 --> 34:21.139
I don't want to marry my husband, madame.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.139
He's old, and he's ugly.

34:26.060 --> 34:27.500
I love Danceny.

34:29.699 --> 34:32.739
Please, madame, help me.
I don't know what to do.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.739
Let's write Danceny a letter.

34:39.540 --> 34:41.780
I've already written him one.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.020
May I see it?

35:42.700 --> 35:45.820
You're not telling him
what you want to tell him, Cecile.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.580
Get your pen.

36:01.780 --> 36:05.420
- What do you call him?
- Chevalier.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.700
Dear Chevalier...

36:17.100 --> 36:21.140
Your love gives me the courage
to follow my heart.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.060
I long to meet you somewhere...

36:26.100 --> 36:28.420
where we can finally be alone.

36:32.340 --> 36:35.420
Our biggest obstacle is my mother.

36:42.460 --> 36:45.780
- So?
- There's nothing to worry about.

36:45.860 --> 36:47.380
Do you think so?

36:47.500 --> 36:50.460
You won't believe how innocent
the whole thing is.

36:50.780 --> 36:52.060
Really?

36:53.020 --> 36:55.860
For example, do you know
how those letters get exchanged?

36:55.940 --> 36:58.420
- How?
- But please...

36:59.420 --> 37:01.940
Cecile shouldn't know that I told you.

37:02.460 --> 37:03.660
My dear.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.140
They put them in the strings of the harp.

37:11.500 --> 37:14.740
<i>Pity the fate of a fair young maiden</i>

37:14.780 --> 37:17.900
<i>Searching the meadows and woods in fear</i>

37:18.380 --> 37:21.580
<i>Useless for her to expend all her efforts</i>

37:21.660 --> 37:24.500
<i>Or to flee when a shepherd draws near</i>

37:25.060 --> 37:27.900
<i>If at night, as she turns to go home</i>

37:28.180 --> 37:31.100
<i>He who has watched her will then appear</i>

37:31.660 --> 37:34.460
<i>She must yield to my magical powers</i>

37:34.780 --> 37:38.700
<i>She cannot hope to keep her flower safe</i>

37:38.780 --> 37:41.300
<i>No matter how hard she try</i>

37:41.380 --> 37:44.660
<i>I'm a great wizard, a wizard am I</i>

37:44.700 --> 37:48.300
<i>I'm a great wizard, a wizard am I</i>

37:53.620 --> 37:57.740
When you practice, mademoiselle,
you have to watch out for this passage.

37:57.820 --> 37:58.980
It's...

38:01.660 --> 38:04.220
One-two-three.

38:04.300 --> 38:06.020
Your rhythm's quavering a bit.

38:06.100 --> 38:08.420
You have to try and keep it steady.

38:18.580 --> 38:20.980
Your daughter's a wonderful student, madame.

38:21.260 --> 38:23.340
Take the cover off, Emile.

38:26.860 --> 38:28.500
Why, maman?

38:42.140 --> 38:43.580
What is this?

38:48.780 --> 38:50.180
What is this?

38:53.980 --> 38:55.340
I don't know.

38:55.980 --> 38:57.780
It's a letter, madame.

38:58.300 --> 39:00.340
It's a letter I wrote to your daughter.

39:01.340 --> 39:04.140
She doesn't know anything about it.
She's telling the truth.

39:05.660 --> 39:08.100
I'm glad to hear that, at least.

39:08.700 --> 39:12.180
Will you wait for me here, young man?
Come along, Cecile.

39:30.140 --> 39:31.220
Come.

39:38.420 --> 39:39.620
Sit down.

39:52.620 --> 39:54.140
Now tell me the truth.

39:55.700 --> 39:58.180
You knew about the letter, didn't you?

39:58.940 --> 40:01.380
No, I didn't. I swear I didn't know.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.940
- Is this the first letter he wrote to you?
- Yes.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.460
So why are you locking your cabinet?

40:09.740 --> 40:11.340
Is it locked?

40:11.740 --> 40:13.180
Give me the key.

40:14.300 --> 40:16.580
I don't know where it is.

40:19.180 --> 40:21.300
It's hanging round your neck.

40:28.940 --> 40:30.500
I'm sorry, maman.

40:31.420 --> 40:34.420
Forgive me. Please. I'm sorry.

40:34.780 --> 40:37.100
Please, maman, forgive me.

40:48.860 --> 40:49.780
Madame...

40:49.820 --> 40:52.540
Young man, you have abused my hospitality...

40:52.820 --> 40:55.900
and you have abused
the innocence of my child.

40:56.380 --> 40:59.220
You will never be admitted
to this house again.

40:59.260 --> 41:02.300
Here are the letters you had the audacity
to give to my daughter.

41:02.460 --> 41:06.260
I want you to send me the letters she wrote to you
and I want them today.

41:07.580 --> 41:09.860
- You may go.
- But, madame...

41:09.940 --> 41:12.500
I don't want to have to call my footman.

41:13.460 --> 41:17.140
Madame, I just want you to know that
I've never abused your hospitality...

41:17.180 --> 41:20.500
and I will never give back the letters
Cecile wrote to me.

41:20.540 --> 41:23.340
In them, she opened her heart to me,
not to you.

41:23.580 --> 41:25.300
I won't betray her confidence.

41:25.380 --> 41:27.660
Her trust means more to me
than all your anger.

41:27.900 --> 41:29.140
Good-bye.

41:54.940 --> 41:55.900
No!

42:00.220 --> 42:01.500
Chevalier!

42:02.620 --> 42:04.260
Do you remember me?

42:06.140 --> 42:08.540
I have a letter for you from Cecile.

42:19.420 --> 42:21.180
My dear Cecile...

42:21.700 --> 42:25.820
to be alone with you is my greatest desire.

42:27.220 --> 42:29.540
And Madame de Merteuil...

42:30.220 --> 42:33.340
has devised a plan for us to meet.

42:34.860 --> 42:38.340
She will explain all the details to you.

42:38.500 --> 42:41.340
I'll invite you and your mother to the opera.

42:41.820 --> 42:45.700
But maman has forbidden me
even to leave the house for two weeks.

42:46.500 --> 42:47.780
Precisely.

42:48.820 --> 42:51.340
Which is why you will decline my invitation...

42:52.180 --> 42:53.700
like a good girl...

42:54.460 --> 42:56.860
so that your mother suspects nothing.

42:59.020 --> 43:00.620
Do you understand?

43:01.100 --> 43:02.100
Yes.

43:02.660 --> 43:04.900
Then, when your mother and I...

43:05.140 --> 43:07.620
<i>are just about to leave for the opera...</i>

43:07.700 --> 43:09.860
<i>I want you to run in and say...</i>

43:09.940 --> 43:11.060
Maman!

43:11.900 --> 43:14.060
Maman, may I come with you?

43:14.380 --> 43:17.500
Please? I promise... Maman.

43:17.540 --> 43:21.140
Let me come with you! Please!
I want to go with you so much!

43:21.180 --> 43:22.340
Please?

43:24.500 --> 43:29.180
My angel, don't think I don't love you,
but you know perfectly well what you did...

43:29.260 --> 43:32.260
so stop acting like a silly child
and go back to your room.

45:26.860 --> 45:28.660
So, here's your dress.

45:29.500 --> 45:31.180
Let's change first.

45:31.460 --> 45:32.460
Why?

45:32.820 --> 45:35.700
Because you want to look beautiful, don't you?

45:41.100 --> 45:43.140
You want me to change into this?

45:43.220 --> 45:45.660
Madame de Merteuil had it made
especially for you.

45:46.340 --> 45:47.500
Really?

46:00.580 --> 46:02.060
Who lives here?

46:02.580 --> 46:03.700
No one.

46:20.460 --> 46:22.340
Take a sip, mademoiselle.

47:39.540 --> 47:43.020
Madame de Merteuil has such exquisite taste.

47:45.940 --> 47:47.500
But my legs show.

47:47.700 --> 47:49.460
They look nice.

47:59.340 --> 48:03.060
Mademoiselle, you look ravishing!

48:54.140 --> 48:58.460
Mademoiselle, do you realize
that we've never been alone before?

48:59.220 --> 49:00.420
Yes.

49:08.460 --> 49:10.100
Please read it now.

49:32.980 --> 49:36.300
Chevalier, this is a poem.

49:36.340 --> 49:39.780
No. It's a song you know.
I only wrote new words for it.

50:00.300 --> 50:01.860
You stay. Stay.

50:01.940 --> 50:05.300
- What's the matter?
- I can't sit still.

50:05.380 --> 50:07.140
I keep thinking about Cecile.

50:07.220 --> 50:09.780
It just broke my heart
to see her so miserable.

50:09.860 --> 50:12.220
I must go home. You stay.

50:21.700 --> 50:23.260
<i>Love</i>

50:23.340 --> 50:25.980
<i>If you will come to me</i>

50:26.060 --> 50:28.660
<i>I will be true to thee</i>

50:28.980 --> 50:31.260
<i>Two lovers true are we...</i>

50:31.340 --> 50:33.740
No. You're making the same mistake again.

50:33.780 --> 50:36.260
It's A in the right hand, not B-flat.

50:38.820 --> 50:41.260
Is this a long song, Chevalier?

50:42.380 --> 50:44.180
It's another 12 verses.

50:55.660 --> 50:56.780
So?

51:01.380 --> 51:02.980
What a nincompoop!

51:03.020 --> 51:04.420
<i>Love</i>

51:04.460 --> 51:06.940
<i>Flowers bloom in my heart...</i>

51:07.020 --> 51:08.940
Sorry to interrupt.
Cecile has to go.

51:09.020 --> 51:10.860
Cecile, get dressed.

51:10.900 --> 51:12.900
- Why?
- Get dressed.

51:14.740 --> 51:17.500
- Your mother is on her way home.
- My God!

51:17.580 --> 51:20.020
- Don't panic, but we must hurry.
- Madame.

51:20.100 --> 51:22.660
- How much can we trust your maid?
- Madame!

51:22.700 --> 51:24.780
Your mother will question her.

51:25.100 --> 51:27.660
- Yes?
- We want to get married.

51:28.780 --> 51:30.820
- Is this true?
- Yes, it is.

51:32.860 --> 51:33.980
Is it?

51:36.340 --> 51:37.580
I think it is.

51:38.860 --> 51:40.660
Will you help us, please?

51:40.900 --> 51:43.180
Is this any time to discuss marriage?

51:47.340 --> 51:48.460
Cecile!

51:49.020 --> 51:51.460
- Martine!
- Yes, madame?

51:54.260 --> 51:55.780
Where is Cecile?

51:56.300 --> 51:57.460
Cecile?

51:58.180 --> 51:59.860
She's...

52:00.300 --> 52:02.060
she has...

52:03.140 --> 52:04.540
Where is she?

52:33.580 --> 52:35.900
Have you been at your post all night?

52:36.140 --> 52:37.140
Yes, madame.

52:37.220 --> 52:40.100
- Has anyone come in?
- No, madame.

52:41.460 --> 52:42.860
Martine.

52:48.300 --> 52:49.660
Yes, madame?

52:54.380 --> 52:56.900
Did she go and see that music teacher?

52:58.020 --> 53:01.940
I don't know, madame.
She doesn't talk to me anymore.

53:02.060 --> 53:04.700
She only talks to Madame de Merteuil now.

53:05.180 --> 53:06.340
And she...

53:07.260 --> 53:08.260
She...

53:08.300 --> 53:09.420
Emile.

53:23.260 --> 53:26.180
Maman. Forgive me, please, maman. Please.

53:26.260 --> 53:28.460
I wanted to be with you so much!

53:29.820 --> 53:33.940
My dear, don't be harsh with her.
She's sorry. She's so sorry.

53:34.180 --> 53:36.500
- Maman.
- Cecile.

53:36.580 --> 53:38.900
Of course I forgive you.

53:38.980 --> 53:42.780
Maman! Please, maman. I'm sorry.

53:44.260 --> 53:46.820
Please forgive me. Please!

53:48.260 --> 53:49.540
Maybe...

53:50.260 --> 53:52.260
I just don't understand her.

53:53.740 --> 53:56.980
Do you think she's ready to be married?

53:59.500 --> 54:01.140
Of course she is.

54:03.300 --> 54:05.340
I even thought...

54:05.700 --> 54:08.300
of sending her back to the convent.

54:09.900 --> 54:11.020
No.

54:12.100 --> 54:13.060
No.

54:14.820 --> 54:17.620
I would just get her out of Paris for a while.

54:20.060 --> 54:23.300
If you like, I could take her to the country.

54:36.980 --> 54:38.900
It isn't easy to find you.

54:40.620 --> 54:42.500
I have a surprise for you.

54:43.060 --> 54:44.780
Monsieur de Valmont...

54:45.100 --> 54:46.500
I must talk to you.

54:46.540 --> 54:49.580
- I know a place. Give me your hand.
- No.

54:51.340 --> 54:52.340
No.

54:54.740 --> 54:56.420
Why didn't you ever tell me?

54:58.860 --> 55:02.180
- What?
- That you're such a brilliant archer.

55:03.380 --> 55:07.660
- What are you talking about?
- Come, I'll show you. Give me your hand.

55:07.940 --> 55:09.860
I'm a brilliant archer?

55:09.900 --> 55:13.140
You'll see. Come on.

55:26.580 --> 55:27.740
Azolan.

55:28.540 --> 55:30.420
What are you waiting for?

55:42.700 --> 55:44.940
Good boys.

55:48.100 --> 55:49.380
Here, sir.

55:50.260 --> 55:54.380
- But I've never shot an arrow in my life.
- Put your hand here...

55:54.980 --> 55:56.860
and your other hand here.

55:58.540 --> 55:59.660
There.

56:04.540 --> 56:06.020
- Ready?
- Yeah.

56:06.060 --> 56:07.020
Now let go.

56:20.420 --> 56:21.740
What a shot!

56:22.380 --> 56:23.660
I knew I was right.

56:24.260 --> 56:26.660
You are a brilliant archer.

56:30.220 --> 56:34.300
Now, if you were to take this coin...

56:34.380 --> 56:37.420
and throw it in that bush,
what do you suppose would happen?

57:19.060 --> 57:21.620
- May I read you something?
- Yes.

57:24.140 --> 57:27.180
This letter is from a close friend of mine.

57:29.300 --> 57:33.060
"All his life, Monsieur de Valmont
has been and is...

57:33.100 --> 57:35.740
"a consummate master of the art of seduction.

57:36.380 --> 57:39.140
"Hundreds of women,
and I am not exaggerating, madame...

57:39.180 --> 57:40.380
"have paid for it.

57:40.940 --> 57:43.180
"He has charmed his countless victims...

57:43.220 --> 57:47.140
"designing his every gesture,
every word, every smile...

57:47.260 --> 57:49.260
"in a cold-blooded scheme...

57:49.340 --> 57:51.620
"that has only one squalid end:

57:52.060 --> 57:54.260
"to destroy the woman's honor."

57:55.820 --> 57:57.260
Is this true?

58:00.100 --> 58:01.540
Who wrote that?

58:03.180 --> 58:04.180
Is it?

58:13.580 --> 58:17.780
Monsieur de Valmont,
don't waste your time on me.

58:18.540 --> 58:21.940
I am not, and I never will be,
one of those women.

58:22.740 --> 58:24.100
I know that.

58:25.860 --> 58:28.180
So, why do you keep trying?

58:32.300 --> 58:33.900
I don't even know.

58:56.060 --> 58:57.460
Vicomte.

58:58.300 --> 59:00.180
Can we offer you a ride?

59:02.940 --> 59:04.900
Look who I brought with me.

59:08.220 --> 59:11.540
- You remember my little cousin.
- Good afternoon.

59:14.900 --> 59:16.820
Would you like to join us?

59:28.820 --> 59:29.980
Attaque!

59:30.380 --> 59:31.580
En garde.

59:32.140 --> 59:33.220
Attaque!

59:33.660 --> 59:34.620
En garde.

59:35.420 --> 59:36.620
Attaque.

59:36.700 --> 59:37.940
En garde.

59:46.380 --> 59:47.460
Next.

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.620
Next.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:59.020
- What's your name, young man?
- Chevalier de Danceny.

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:03.100
Good wrist.
I'm glad you want to join my regiment.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.180
I don't, sir.

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:13.380
Next.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.780
Such a pity that he doesn't have any children.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.340
Children just adore my nephew.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.300
I'm not a child!

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:37.180
Of course not. You're a knight
defending the honor of his lady.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.420
Attaque!

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:47.540
Madame?

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:51.660
You've known Monsieur de Valmont a long time,
haven't you?

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.620
Yes. A long time.

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:00.260
What kind of man is he?

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.500
He's...

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:09.820
If I had a brother,
I'd want him to be just like Valmont.

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.860
Do you think a man can change?

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.340
How old are you?

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.220
22.

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.980
May I offer you some advice?

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.380
Yes.

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:36.300
I think you should leave this place, madame.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.780
I think you should go
and join your husband.

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.020
Why do you say that?

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:48.220
Are you in love with Monsieur de Valmont?

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.580
No, certainly not.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.740
That's good.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.700
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.660
Because he's in love with you, you know?

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.580
I'm dying.

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.620
I'm dying. Forgive me my sins.
Have mercy!

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:22.340
- I'm dying. Forgive me!
- He's dead! I killed him.

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:23.820
I won!

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:31.220
Good night, my dears.

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:33.300
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.460
I don't recognize you.
Just look at her.

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.860
How can you resist this?

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.660
Please don't start that again.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:52.060
How's it going with the little Tourvel?

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.500
Would you like to cancel our bet?

01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:59.660
Certainly not.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:04.540
- Aren't you getting a little too serious?
- What are you talking about?

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:07.300
About love, my angel.

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.860
What else?

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.020
I have to write a letter to Danceny.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.700
It's all right.

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.780
It's all right.
You don't have to keep any secrets from him.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.100
He's our friend.

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:27.580
Would you come and read it after I finish
and tell me if it's all right?

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:30.180
Why don't you ask Monsieur de Valmont?

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.020
He knows what men like to hear.

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:37.620
Would you, monsieur?

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.700
Of course he will.
Now go up, start your letter.

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.460
- He'll be right up to help you.
- All right.

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.980
You never stop, do you?

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.500
All I'm asking is that
you help the poor child to write a letter.

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.420
Monsieur de Valmont.

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:34.939
- May I talk to you for a moment, please?
- Of course.

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:54.700
Come in.

01:08:54.979 --> 01:08:57.899
- Sit down, please.
- Monsieur de Valmont?

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:02.220
- Yes?
- No, please don't interrupt me.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.540
I would never tell you what to do...

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.660
but...

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:11.899
Please...

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.540
Go away.

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:16.380
Please, go away.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.500
I know I should be the one to leave.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:21.979
I know it's my duty,
but I haven't the strength.

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.100
I can't go on like this.

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:28.300
When I sit down, you sit next to me.
When I speak, you answer.

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:31.580
I blush in your company,
and everybody sees it.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.260
But, when...

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.380
When I am alone...

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.580
Please, go away. I beg you.

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:46.500
Please.

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.620
Please go.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.100
Is that what you want?

01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:59.300
Do you want me to say...

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.900
that I don't want you to leave?

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.860
I can't say that. I can't!

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:07.940
No!

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.860
All right. Let's see what you have.

01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:45.780
No.

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.300
This is no way to write a love letter.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.980
Take a new sheet.

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.180
Dear madame...

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:09.460
Monsieur le Chevalier.

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:15.700
Did I err in giving you my heart?

01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:19.700
- "Err" with double "R"?
- Double "R," yes.

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.860
Why do I feel...

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.500
now that I'm not with you...

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.060
that I love you...

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:36.740
even more?

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:43.660
Why am I haunted by your face...

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.980
my every waking minute...

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:50.940
and every dreaming minute...

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.940
of my nights?

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:03.500
Did I say to stop writing?

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:05.340
No.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:06.980
So go on.

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:12.060
Ever since I've known you,
I can't think of anyone else.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.740
I know that you love me...

01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:20.380
and I pray your love will last.

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:25.820
If we had another moment alone...

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:29.340
I know you would take me in your arms...

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.260
and I long to be with you.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.060
I long to be with you.

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.380
Are you deaf?

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:45.860
No.

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:47.500
So keep writing.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:57.700
I long to share...

01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.460
all those sweet moments.

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:03.620
Now...

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:06.620
I only dream of them.

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:11.460
And the longer I'm without you...

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:15.660
the more vivid my dreams become.

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:21.780
I only hope...

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.580
that you think of me...

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:29.500
with the same passion
that I feel for you.

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.780
Do you have a better way to say it?

01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:43.580
No.

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.020
So?

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:58.740
One day...

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.740
we'll be together...

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.420
and we'll know the joys of love.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.820
And no man...

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.420
no...

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:14.260
God...

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:16.980
can prevent this.

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.580
I must stop writing now.

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:28.940
I close my eyes...

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.180
and you are here with me.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.540
The castle is quiet...

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.300
and I'm so happy.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.420
I love you.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.900
I love you.

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.420
My God. What happened?

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:38.060
Something awful happened, madame.

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.300
Something...

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.100
What?

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:48.580
I don't even know. It all happened...

01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:51.860
Monsieur de Valmont wanted me to write...

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.060
so I was writing that letter.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:56.940
And?

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:01.380
You know.

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.780
Monsieur de Valmont is quite a writer, isn't he?

01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:16.900
Believe me, madame.

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.940
I kept saying no.

01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:22.620
But I kept doing what he wanted me to do.

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.860
But I don't love him, madame.

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.780
Really, I don't.

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:33.460
There were moments when...

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.660
I felt like I did.

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:39.460
If my mother should find out about this.

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.220
Cecile.

01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:50.780
You're not a little girl anymore.

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.020
Yes.

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:56.140
Your mother must never know about this.

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.820
But she wants me to marry
Monsieur de Gercourt.

01:16:58.940 --> 01:16:59.940
So?

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:04.460
You marry Monsieur de Gercourt.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.700
But I love Danceny.

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.700
Danceny will be your lover.

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.060
You will marry Gercourt...

01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:20.780
and you will keep Danceny
as your lover.

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:25.540
Do you understand?

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:28.380
No.

01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:30.660
You don't marry your lover.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.580
You don't?

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:39.940
I'm sorry.

01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:43.060
I must seem very stupid to you, madame.

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:44.940
No.

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.660
You're the first person that...

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:55.900
No one's ever talked to me
about these things before.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.420
I love you, Cecile.

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.780
I love you, too, madame.

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:21.220
Did you like what you did
with Monsieur de Valmont?

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:30.620
Then you have nothing to worry about, Cecile.

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.740
Good morning, madame.

01:18:58.260 --> 01:18:59.940
Where is everybody?

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:03.620
Why is everybody late this morning?

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:05.940
Do you remember me?

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.180
Madame de Volanges.

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:10.220
I know.

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:12.780
I've come from Paris.

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:14.820
Why?

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.980
I've come to take my daughter home.

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:20.420
You know. Cecile.

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.300
She's such a little darling.
We all adore her.

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.460
Yes?

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.620
Cecile!

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:03.060
Maman.

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:07.460
Good morning, ladies.

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.940
Madame, what an enchanting surprise.

01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:14.020
Marquise.

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.260
Mademoiselle, let us see your hands.

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.780
Do you call those clean?

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.100
Go on. Quickly.

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:33.020
We're all so in love with your daughter.
She's such a treasure.

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:38.580
- You must be very proud.
- I certainly am, monsieur.

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:42.820
I would hesitate to marry her
to a man she didn't love.

01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:48.260
- I beg your pardon?
- I think I would be ashamed.

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:53.780
I think I know what is best
for my daughter's happiness, monsieur.

01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:56.540
But can't you see that
she's in love with another man?

01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:57.700
Are you...

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:01.300
- Are you talking about that harp teacher?
- Yes.

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:05.580
Are you suggesting that
Cecile should marry that boy?

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:06.980
Exactly.

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.820
Are you losing your mind?

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:12.420
You can't build a lasting marriage...

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:14.980
on the fancies of a 15-year-old girl.

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.220
Why not?

01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:18.780
Look around you.

01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:22.860
Look at all the tragedies caused
by this illusion of love.

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:26.580
It's just as tragic when a mother
destroys her daughter's life.

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:30.260
Vicomte, you know nothing
of arranged marriages.

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.580
You've never even been married.

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:36.660
Those bonds are often very strong.

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:40.940
And you'd be surprised.
They can often lead to true happiness.

01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.900
My sweet girl.

01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:46.500
If I understand what these people
have been saying...

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.740
you have a dilemma.

01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:56.660
- I do?
- Tell me, if it were up to you...

01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:01.540
would you rather marry that Monsieur de...

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:04.660
- Gercourt.
- Exactly. Gercourt.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:06.540
Or the other one...

01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:08.860
the one with the harp?

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.860
I'd do whatever maman wants me to do.

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:24.740
But that's not what my aunt is asking you.
Forget maman.

01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.860
If you had the choice, who would you pick?
You, yourself.

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:38.740
I guess I would marry Monsieur de Gercourt...

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:42.100
and keep Monsieur de Danceny for a lover?

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:47.380
And maman will have a huge scandal on her hands.

01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:52.180
So the dilemma is solved.

01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:53.780
Let us eat.

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.140
Are we not going to wait
for Madame de Tourvel?

01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:59.900
Madame who? Yes, of course.
Madame de Tourvel.

01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:03.060
She went back to Paris this morning.

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.340
I don't even know why.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.820
It was all very unexpected...

01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:11.300
and she was in such a state.

01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:15.460
I had difficulty going back to sleep
after we said good-bye.

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:27.500
What did he say?

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:34.380
I don't know! I'm deaf in this one.

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.660
Don't tell anyone I'm back.

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:26.900
Sleep.

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:29.500
Sleep on.

01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:32.980
Let me just stay here and look at you.

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:43.460
Night after night,
I had to close my eyes to see your face.

01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:50.100
- Would you rather I was quiet?
- No.

01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:58.100
Do you want me to bring you some milk?

01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.660
A glass of wine?

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.820
What do you want? Tell me.

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:12.100
Your horse is in the stable.

01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.860
Say something.

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:19.140
Anything. I want to hear your voice.

01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:24.540
When does your husband come back?

01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:30.100
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:35.140
I wrote him a letter while you were sleeping.

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:37.420
I told him everything.

01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:44.220
- May I see the letter?
- It's gone. I couldn't wait.

01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:46.660
No. Don't move.

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:49.180
I'll prepare something for you.

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.060
I'll wait on you.

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:55.620
I want to serve you.

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.340
<i>My dear...</i>

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:13.260
<i>I feel so much tenderness toward you...</i>

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:16.300
<i>that I cannot bear to face you
when you learn the truth.</i>

01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:18.820
<i>You were right.</i>

01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:22.660
<i>For a few illusory moments,
I thought I could change.</i>

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.820
<i>I know now I cannot.</i>

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.020
<i>I urge you to find another lover...</i>

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.820
<i>one who is worthy of you...</i>

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:34.180
<i>and I thank you for what
you have given me.</i>

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:44.140
Vicomte!

01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:49.740
I didn't even have a chance to thank you
for the kindness you showed Cecile.

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.420
- My pleasure.
- No.

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:54.540
Mine.

01:28:58.180 --> 01:28:59.500
Marquise.

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:02.500
You lost your bet.

01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.340
No.

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:08.100
Yes.

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:16.060
I'm very impressed.

01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:19.540
How was it?

01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:22.620
Quite wonderful.

01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:25.260
Better than Cecile?

01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:26.740
Yes.

01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:29.020
Better than me?

01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:32.420
No one compares to you.

01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:35.940
How true.

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:40.980
In fact, I couldn't wait to claim my reward.

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.740
- What reward?
- You forgot our bet?

01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:48.420
- Valmont, that was just a joke.
- Not for me.

01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:51.260
Please!

01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:54.780
Would you have locked yourself in a monastery
if you'd lost?

01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:56.740
- But I didn't lose.
- But if you did.

01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:59.060
If. That's not even a question.

01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:00.980
Yes, it is. Imagine that you lost.

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:02.700
- But I won.
- Imagine!

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:04.860
Don't try to change the subject.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.380
And am I something that one wins as a wager?

01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:09.020
Yes! Because you accepted it.

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:11.380
I know. You won, but if you did lose...

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:13.220
- But I didn't!
- I know, for God's sake.

01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:17.060
What are you going on about?
I won, and I have the right to collect my prize!

01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:30.300
Now you sound just like a husband.

01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:37.260
Do you want to know why I never remarried?

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:43.660
So that no one could ever claim
they had any rights over me at all.

01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:49.020
You are confusing bets and marriages, madame.

01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:52.460
One must always honor a bet.

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:47.140
You don't want me?

01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:52.780
You had your chance.

01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:57.860
Yes?

01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:08.620
Thank you, Victoire.

01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:24.700
I'm sorry, but you'll have to leave now.

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:28.220
Show me the letter.

01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:34.100
- Vicomte.
- Show me that letter.

01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:37.940
Certainly.

01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:46.980
Here.

01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:55.980
Is this a declaration of war?

01:32:58.260 --> 01:32:59.620
If you wish.

01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:41.780
- Monsieur de Valmont?
- Yes.

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:44.060
I'm Chevalier de Danceny.

01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:49.980
Sir, I'm infinitely grateful to you
for getting Cecile's letter to me.

01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:56.460
Would you be kind enough to forward my reply?

01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:00.540
It's extremely important that
I get an answer as soon as possible.

01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:02.500
I'll deliver it myself.

01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:06.220
Monsieur de Valmont.

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:08.820
Shall I announce you?

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.780
I'll announce myself.

01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:38.820
- Who's there?
- Valmont.

01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:01.100
He says he wants to die for me.

01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:03.140
Sounds as if he loves you.

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:07.420
He's asking me if he should challenge
Monsieur de Gercourt to a duel.

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:09.260
Do you still love him?

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:15.340
Believe me, sir, I've been trying
not to love him.

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:18.420
I pray to God all the time
to make me forget him.

01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:21.580
But since I pray all the time...

01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:23.940
I think about him all the time.

01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:26.980
Then you only have one choice.

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:28.540
What?

01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:33.540
- We have to write Danceny another letter.
- Yes.

01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:37.860
But...

01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:41.980
We will only write, won't we, sir?

01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:44.300
Yes.

01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:46.340
Yes, we'll only write.

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.060
Thank you.

01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:07.620
I believe that the only way
to prevent this marriage...

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.820
is for us to run away together now.

01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:14.060
It is?

01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:15.740
Yes, it is.

01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:24.180
But the prospect of a life in a foreign country...

01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.060
frightens me.

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:28.380
Yes, it does.

01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:37.620
- Who is it?
- It's me, my darling.

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:39.660
I have someone with me.

01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.260
I won't disturb you for long.

01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:45.860
Just a minute, maman.

01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:48.580
It's lovely of you to do this.

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:52.260
I've discussed the wedding arrangements with her...

01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:56.620
but I left the final announcement
to you, of course.

01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.700
Yes, maman.

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.500
Mademoiselle.

01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:13.500
I hope this small token will please you.

01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:18.380
Thank you.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.340
- May I open it?
- Please do.

01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:27.340
It's beautiful!

01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:30.500
Thank you. Look, maman.

01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:33.660
You will be pleased to know that our marriage...

01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:38.100
will be celebrated in the royal chapel,
with the King himself in attendance.

01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.980
Ladies, this has been a pleasure.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.100
Thank you, my dear.

01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:11.380
Did you hear that about the King?

01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:13.980
So is this the end of Danceny?

01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:19.140
No.

01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:24.900
I suppose I should be firm with myself now...

01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:26.660
shouldn't I?

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.420
You should.

01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:42.620
Where were we?

01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:46.420
"But the prospect of a life in a foreign country
frightens me."

01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:48.220
On the other hand...

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:51.940
<i>Madame de Merteuil thinks
that I should marry Gercourt...</i>

01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:53.820
<i>and keep you as a lover.</i>

01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:58.060
<i>Do you think this is good advice,
and would you accept it?</i>

01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:00.580
What is it?

01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:02.620
Thank you, sir.

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:05.180
I couldn't thank you enough.

01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:20.860
- Yes?
- Madame, Chevalier de Danceny is calling.

01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:24.500
Show him into the salon.

01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:51.140
Chevalier.

01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:55.140
I was just thinking about you.
We have so much to talk about.

01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:57.260
I want to send a letter to Cecile, madame.

01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:01.340
By all means.
I'd be happy to help you, sit down.

01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.140
No, madame. You sit down.

01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:06.780
You will write, and I will dictate.

01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.540
It will be your letter to Cecile.

01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:12.260
My letter?

01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:16.260
Interesting. We never tried that.

01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:24.460
I'm ready.

01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:27.340
My dear Cecile.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:37.100
I must apologize for the advice I gave you.

01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:38.500
Young man...

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:42.660
that's not my style, to apologize.

01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:53.540
Keep writing.

01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:09.860
If you truly love your Danceny...

01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:12.980
as much as I believe you do...

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:18.140
then it would be a crime
to marry anyone else.

01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:21.540
That's good.

01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:24.620
That's good, but...

01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.580
May I ask you a question?

01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:31.740
Yes.

01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:35.780
How old are you?

01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:38.060
I'm 17.

01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:43.860
Why do you want to be a husband...

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:46.660
when you can be a lover?

01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:53.740
Keep writing.

01:41:56.340 --> 01:42:00.460
Why don't you leave
all the boredom of marriage to Gercourt...

01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:03.860
and keep the excitement of love for yourself?

01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:06.980
- Keep writing, I said.
- I will.

01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:08.900
But...

01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:13.580
Do you really believe yourself
capable of killing me?

01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:19.340
What?

01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:22.940
Sir, come here quick and look out the window.

01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:48.260
I made it very clear that you weren't home,
but look, she's still there.

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.380
What do you want me to do?

01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:24.380
Why did you come?

01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:28.820
What do you think you'll find here?

01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:33.940
That you love me.

01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:38.460
Do you want me to lie to you?

01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:43.460
Yes.

01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:58.220
Where is she?

01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:03.220
She left.

01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:06.500
She woke me up. It was still dark.

01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:11.140
- Did she say anything?
- No.

01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:27.920
Azolan!

01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:30.740
Yes, sir?

01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.460
Get me some flowers!

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.020
Excuse me?

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.280
Roses.

01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:16.260
I'm not at home to anyone.

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.380
It's Monsieur de Valmont.

01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:22.540
Show him into the salon.

01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:59.380
You must have a lot of courage, Vicomte...

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.700
to come here after you sent that...

01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:05.580
lunatic harp teacher to kill me.

01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:10.620
I apologize for that.

01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:17.820
It was a silly thing to do.

01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:25.140
I feel awful.

01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:30.140
Are you surprised?

01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:36.540
You are an awful man.

01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:41.980
Do you think a man can change?

01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:46.220
Yes.

01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:48.700
For the worse.

01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:54.180
I think you're as awful as I am.

01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.500
I am.

01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:01.260
That's why we should never be enemies.

01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:07.220
We should always be friends...

01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:09.460
good friends.

01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:13.460
- More than that.
- Lovers?

01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:19.380
Even more.

01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:22.380
You're not proposing marriage?

01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:24.980
What if I were?

01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:30.580
But that's wonderful.

01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:36.100
Wonderful.

01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:38.980
Tell me.

01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:43.740
Which of us would betray
the other first this time?

01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:53.020
I'm sorry.

01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:07.060
I've missed you so much.

01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:17.140
I still love you, you know?

01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:38.460
Isn't it lonely when there's no one
to share your secrets with?

01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:40.220
Yes, it is.

01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:43.420
Would you like to share my latest secret?

01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:45.260
Yes.

01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:48.100
Come.

01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:18.460
I've explained to Monsieur de Danceny...

01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:21.940
that Cecile lost her virginity in your arms...

01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:24.620
but he didn't believe me.

01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:27.260
So since you happen to be here...

01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:30.420
would you mind telling him
about it yourself?

01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:17.380
I want that.

01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:21.180
- But the same money...
- No! That!

01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:22.460
Yes, sir.

01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:33.540
I'm sorry, monsieur. Madame de Volanges...

01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:37.540
- What?
- I'm not supposed to let you in, monsieur.

01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:38.980
Strict orders.

01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:40.820
No.

01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:44.780
No, monsieur, seriously.
I could lose my position.

01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:35.900
- Who is it?
- It's Valmont.

01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:57.120
Put this on.

01:54:57.860 --> 01:54:59.460
We're leaving now.

01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:02.580
We have to go now, right now.

01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:06.220
Nobody must recognize you.
We're traveling together as two men.

01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:09.500
You understand?
We're going as two men. In disguise.

01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:12.180
And Danceny is already waiting.

01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:14.940
He's in the country. It's very far.

01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:17.420
- We have to go now, right now.
- No, he's not.

01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:20.420
Yes, he is.

01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:23.660
No, he's not.

01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:25.620
Vicomte.

01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:32.300
I thought it was time
that Cecile knew the truth.

01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:41.100
Monsieur de Valmont,
you will leave this house immediately.

01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:29.420
Monsieur de Valmont?

01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:34.500
I am Baron de Segur,
and this is Chevalier de Malpoix.

01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:40.420
Chevalier de Danceny expects you
at dawn tomorrow at this location.

01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:46.460
We are his witnesses.
We count on your discretion.

01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:52.100
I'll meet him there.

01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:39.220
You!

01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:43.700
Yes, you.

01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:45.460
And him.

01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:47.020
Him!

01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:49.300
And him!

01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:19.220
Sit!

01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:24.460
Sit!

01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:29.740
Good boy.

01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:38.340
Sir.

01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:43.660
Sir, are you sure you feel up to a duel?

01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:10.500
Sir.

01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:51.380
Gentlemen.

01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:57.020
Sir, where are your witnesses?

01:59:58.620 --> 02:00:00.940
Monsieur le Duc, will you step up, please?

02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:05.460
Monsieur le Baron.

02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:10.820
Hurry up. Come on, don't be afraid.

02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:12.540
Hurry up.

02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:17.260
Sir.

02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:21.140
It would be embarrassing for me
to fight you in your condition.

02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:24.740
So what do we do, send for our harps?

02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:29.420
If you offer me your apology,
I'd gladly forgive you.

02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:31.100
My apology?

02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:34.260
You want my apology?

02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:39.540
After everything I've done for you...

02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:41.300
you will forgive me.

02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:44.300
You...

02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:47.660
defend yourself.

02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:48.700
Madame.

02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:03.820
Madame, can I tell you a secret?

02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:07.100
A secret that I haven't told anyone yet.

02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:09.540
Yes, my child.

02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:17.180
I think I'm pregnant.

02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:24.660
I'm quite sure that I am.

02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:29.420
Is it...

02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:35.100
Valmont's?

02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:50.620
My angel.

02:03:56.100 --> 02:03:58.860
My sweet angel.

02:03:59.305 --> 02:04:05.647
