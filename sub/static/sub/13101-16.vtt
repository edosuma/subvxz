WEBVTT

00:01.833 --> 00:03.083
This is
Commander Susan Ivanova

00:03.167 --> 00:04.958
bringing you
the Voice of the Resistance.

00:05.042 --> 00:07.708
The liberation fleet
continues to retake territory

00:07.792 --> 00:10.917
held in violation of
the Earth Alliance constitution.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.500
More ships on the other side
continue to defect

00:13.583 --> 00:15.458
carrying stories
of atrocities carried out

00:15.542 --> 00:18.083
under the direct orders
of President Clark.

00:18.167 --> 00:20.708
In addition to the liberation
of Proxima III

00:20.792 --> 00:23.625
the colony at Beta Durani
and the Midirange Military Base

00:23.708 --> 00:25.375
have also been freed.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.792
The long march
toward Earth continues.

00:29.667 --> 00:31.875
(Garibaldi)
Personal log,
Michael Garibaldi.

00:31.958 --> 00:34.667
It's started,
they're really doing it.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.042
This is what
I was afraid would happen.

00:37.125 --> 00:39.125
But it's been coming
for a long time.

00:39.208 --> 00:41.625
Ever since Sheridan got back.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.292
Before he went to Z'ha'dum

00:43.375 --> 00:45.417
he never would have gone up
against his own

00:45.500 --> 00:47.625
our own government like this.

00:47.708 --> 00:50.458
I don't know, maybe he thinks
he's Alexander the Great.

00:50.542 --> 00:53.125
And maybe he thinks
he's John the Baptist.

00:53.208 --> 00:54.917
And maybe he wants
to take over

00:55.000 --> 00:57.542
the whole operation
for himself.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.625
That's the part
that worries me.

00:59.708 --> 01:04.292
That's the part that made me
come back here. Mars.

01:04.375 --> 01:06.917
I can't believe
I'm back on Mars.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.417
Three times before,
this place almost killed me.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.458
I swore I'd never give it
another chance

01:11.542 --> 01:15.250
to finish the job. Humans got
no business being here.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.083
No business at all.

01:20.375 --> 01:22.667
(Wade)
It's almost time.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.458
You have to put this on now.

01:25.917 --> 01:28.167
I think you've been watching
too many spy vids.

01:29.875 --> 01:31.708
You wanna see the big guy you
got to play

01:31.792 --> 01:33.833
'by the big guy's rules.'

01:33.917 --> 01:37.458
I'm really sorry if this
troubles you, Mr. Garibaldi.

01:37.542 --> 01:39.833
You're the type of guy who
doesn't like to give up control.

01:39.917 --> 01:41.167
I can see that.

01:41.250 --> 01:44.167
And I sympathize,
I really do.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.375
But it's either this..

01:46.458 --> 01:48.875
...or I put you on
the next transport out.

01:49.917 --> 01:51.833
I'm gonna look stupid.

01:54.958 --> 01:57.792
You know, at certain times
of our lives we all look stupid

01:57.875 --> 02:00.583
but I think
the key is not to mind it.

02:00.667 --> 02:03.583
Now, Mr. Edgars has gone
through a lot of trouble

02:03.667 --> 02:05.500
to clear you through
this blockade.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.542
The average guy
would be very grateful.

02:07.625 --> 02:11.375
Wouldn't wanna cause
Mr. Edgars any more trouble.

02:11.458 --> 02:14.875
- I'm not your average guy.
- No, you're not.

02:14.958 --> 02:17.667
That's a very good point.

02:17.750 --> 02:19.208
I'm not, either.

02:19.292 --> 02:21.042
'Mr. Edgars
doesn't like average guys.'

02:21.125 --> 02:22.833
He likes his people smart.

02:22.917 --> 02:24.917
Well spoken, presentable.

02:26.542 --> 02:29.208
I ever tell you I have
a Masters in Literature?

02:29.292 --> 02:31.542
Well, don't take this personally
but you don't seem the type.

02:31.625 --> 02:35.667
illusion,
Mr. Garibaldi.

02:35.750 --> 02:40.458
Concepts of language, light
metaphor, nothing is real.

02:40.542 --> 02:43.125
Except this blindfold.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.625
Which you will put on now.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.792
Otherwise we turn around.

02:49.792 --> 02:51.667
[intense music]

02:54.083 --> 02:55.750
Won't some people
think it's weird

02:55.833 --> 02:57.625
to see me walk out like this?

02:57.708 --> 03:02.208
'No. Mr. Edgars
has his own private dock.'

03:02.292 --> 03:06.417
Did you know this place
was named after the God of war?

03:06.500 --> 03:09.625
'Its rising foretold
the death of kings.'

03:09.708 --> 03:12.875
Collapse of empires,
it was a bad sign.

03:14.167 --> 03:17.042
Now there are two million
people living here.

03:17.125 --> 03:19.125
It's still a bad sign.

03:24.417 --> 03:26.917
(Garibaldi)
Mars..

03:27.000 --> 03:30.125
Can't believe
I'm back on Mars.

03:30.208 --> 03:32.333
I've got to be out of my mind.

03:35.792 --> 03:38.167
[theme music]

03:38.250 --> 03:40.125
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.250
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

03:42.333 --> 03:45.250
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.958
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

03:47.042 --> 03:49.125
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

03:49.208 --> 03:50.833
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

03:50.917 --> 03:52.208
(Delenn)
And the year of joy.

03:52.292 --> 03:54.375
(Londo)
It was a new age.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.250
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

03:56.333 --> 03:59.083
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

04:01.792 --> 04:04.375
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.

04:04.458 --> 04:05.750
The place..

04:05.833 --> 04:07.458
(Sheridan)
Babylon 5.

04:07.542 --> 04:10.583
[music continues]

04:27.333 --> 04:30.125
[music continues]

04:57.292 --> 05:00.167
[music continues]

05:04.250 --> 05:05.875

05:07.292 --> 05:09.708

'Warning,

05:09.792 --> 05:11.208
'Heartbeat irregular.'

05:11.292 --> 05:13.792
'Cerebral activity

05:13.875 --> 05:17.417

05:17.500 --> 05:19.417

05:23.292 --> 05:25.375
'Returning to nominal.'

05:25.458 --> 05:27.083
Any luck, doc?

05:27.167 --> 05:28.583
Zip.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.625
Shadow implants
have defense systems

05:30.708 --> 05:32.958
on top of defense systems.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.500
[sighs]

05:34.583 --> 05:35.958
You know..

05:36.042 --> 05:37.792
...I tried going in surgically

05:37.875 --> 05:39.125
from unaffected
parts of the brain.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.333
I tried freezing it off,
I can't even move

05:41.417 --> 05:42.750
one of the epidermal implants
aside

05:42.833 --> 05:44.417
without it trying
to kill the patient.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.417
Well, we know they wanted to use
the telepaths for their ships.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.125
Guess once they got you they
don't wanna let you go, huh?

05:50.208 --> 05:51.792
I can't even bring
in the heavy scanners.

05:51.875 --> 05:54.250
Everything has to be isolated
off the primary computer systems

05:54.333 --> 05:56.583
because when they wake up,
they bond instantly

05:56.667 --> 05:58.375
to any computer system nearby.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.375
hostile!

06:01.458 --> 06:04.292
I can't take the risk, not after
what happened last time.

06:04.375 --> 06:06.833
And the captain,
the captain he just keeps

06:06.917 --> 06:09.167
bugging me about
this every time he calls.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.042
- Did he tell you why?
- No.

06:11.125 --> 06:12.417
No, he does not tell me why

06:12.500 --> 06:15.000
and that just makes it
even more frustrating.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.333
I mean, these implants
are beyond anything

06:16.417 --> 06:18.000
I've ever encountered before.

06:18.083 --> 06:20.833
And after a while, you know,
that really starts to annoy me.

06:23.042 --> 06:25.333
[sighs]
I should be able
to figure this out.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.208
It gets away
from me every time.

06:28.292 --> 06:30.625
Ah, well, you'll work it out.
You always do.

06:30.708 --> 06:33.542
Yeah. I just wish I knew
why the captain

06:33.625 --> 06:35.417
was in such a hurry
about this all of a sudden.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.583
[door opens]

06:36.667 --> 06:38.500
Yeah, I'll be right back.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.958
Zack.

06:41.042 --> 06:42.375
Ivanova said
you were looking for me.

06:42.458 --> 06:43.750
Oh, Lyta, yeah.

06:43.833 --> 06:45.667
We got a guy in Med Lab 4

06:45.750 --> 06:47.167
who was mugged in down below.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.750
Now, we think we got the perp

06:48.833 --> 06:50.042
but the victim's pretty shook up

06:50.125 --> 06:51.583
doesn't remember
much of what happened.

06:51.667 --> 06:54.375
We need confirmation
that this is the guy who did it.

06:54.458 --> 06:57.792
I can't scan a suspect
in a criminal investigation.

06:57.875 --> 07:01.458
Zack, you know that. It's-it's a
violation of due process.

07:01.542 --> 07:02.833
(Zack)
'Relax.'

07:02.917 --> 07:05.833
'It's the victim
who wants to be scanned.'

07:05.917 --> 07:07.708
Now, you'll go into his head,
look around

07:07.792 --> 07:09.750
see if you can help him
remember anything.

07:09.833 --> 07:12.958
If you can pull
a visual ID on the guy

07:13.042 --> 07:16.167
we'll have you do a lineup,
then we'll take it from there.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.833
Standard commission
plus 10% stress fee

07:18.917 --> 07:20.792
if I have to relive the attack.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.667
Done, just let me
tell him we're coming.

07:23.750 --> 07:26.583
[instrumental music]

07:29.583 --> 07:31.167
[heartbeat pounding]

07:32.708 --> 07:35.000
[Shadow shrieking]

07:43.292 --> 07:45.083
50 cc's until she's stable

07:45.167 --> 07:46.875
and then I'll come by
and I'll..

07:46.958 --> 07:48.500
[clattering]

07:50.333 --> 07:52.208
[intense music]

08:04.292 --> 08:05.792
Lyta.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.583
[instrumental music]

08:33.625 --> 08:36.375
- Hello, Lise.
- Michael.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.292
You shouldn't have come,
not now.

08:39.375 --> 08:40.792
Why?

08:40.875 --> 08:43.083
A man's got a right to meet
his employer face to face.

08:43.167 --> 08:44.875
This isn't a good time.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.167
Ah, well, at least
we're consistent.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.917
There never has been
a good time for us, has there?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.458
(Lise)
'It's just..'

08:53.875 --> 08:55.875
...things are very busy,
right now.

08:55.958 --> 08:59.167
- William has a lot--
- It's alright, Lise.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.250
(William)
'Our guest has come a long way
on a hard road.'

09:02.333 --> 09:04.375
I hope the trip
wasn't too difficult.

09:04.458 --> 09:07.583
- I've had worse.
- Yeah, I'm sure you have.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.292
- Beatrice was looking for you.
- Oh.

09:09.375 --> 09:10.792
She had some questions
about dinner.

09:10.875 --> 09:14.125
- Do you think you could, uh--
- Yes, of course.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.833
Michael.

09:18.917 --> 09:22.417
I, uh, apologize
for the smallness of the house.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.125
As you know,
space is at a premium on Mars.

09:25.208 --> 09:28.875
And since this is where we have
our corporate headquarters

09:28.958 --> 09:31.333
I have to spend at least
six months a year here

09:31.417 --> 09:33.458
or lose half my tax benefits.

09:33.542 --> 09:35.958
- Would you, um..
- Uh, thank you, no, I don't.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.042
No, you-you don't drink
anymore, I know.

09:39.125 --> 09:41.792
I make it a point to know
all I can about my employees.

09:41.875 --> 09:45.333
'There's, um, juice,
mineral water.'

09:45.417 --> 09:48.083
- No, thank you.
- Mmm.

09:48.167 --> 09:51.708
Next time, you'll have to come
see us back on Earth.

09:51.792 --> 09:55.042
500 acres of watershed land.

09:55.125 --> 09:59.125
The more I'm in the dome,
the more I miss it.

09:59.208 --> 10:01.292
As I said..

10:01.375 --> 10:03.958
...long way on a hard road.

10:04.042 --> 10:06.792
I said I'd ask you to come
when the time was right.

10:06.875 --> 10:10.000
You insisted on seeing me now.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.708
Why?

10:11.792 --> 10:13.042
Because I got tired
of not seeing

10:13.125 --> 10:15.250
the face of the man
that I work for.

10:15.333 --> 10:17.208
'And I wanna know what the hell
it is I've been helping you'

10:17.292 --> 10:19.958
smuggle past B5 customs.

10:20.042 --> 10:21.625
And because somebody's
got to stop

10:21.708 --> 10:23.500
Sheridan's war against Earth.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.792
I'm just a businessman,
Mr. Garibaldi.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.500
'Don't play me for stupid.'

10:27.583 --> 10:28.792
Edgars pharmaceuticals is

10:28.875 --> 10:30.542
the fourth largest
megacorp back home.

10:30.625 --> 10:32.750
Your chemical weapons division
is one of the major suppliers

10:32.833 --> 10:34.875
'to Earthforce, and you've got
at least two dozen lobbyists'

10:34.958 --> 10:36.542
working Earthdome.

10:36.625 --> 10:40.208
And you practically bought
Senator Claxby's re-election.

10:40.292 --> 10:42.333
Yes, well, that was before
President Clark's

10:42.417 --> 10:44.583
night of the long knives
last year.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.583
It doesn't matter, you got
people who owe you big time

10:46.667 --> 10:48.583
people in high places.

10:48.667 --> 10:51.250
And what exactly
do you think I can do for you?

10:55.125 --> 10:58.875
- I don't trust Clark.
- Yes, well, who does?

10:58.958 --> 11:00.667
Many of us believed
he was behind

11:00.750 --> 11:02.333
President Santiago's
assassination

11:02.417 --> 11:05.042
long before your people
leaked anything.

11:05.125 --> 11:06.417
(William)
'He's out of control.'

11:06.500 --> 11:07.792
'He's running scared.'

11:07.875 --> 11:09.792
He needs to be stopped..

11:09.875 --> 11:12.000
...but not by
a military action.

11:12.083 --> 11:14.083
We have to work
from inside the system.

11:14.167 --> 11:15.583
That's just what I'm saying.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.667
Unless Sheridan's stopped,
he'll tear Earth apart.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.917
Now, if you ask me..

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
...I think he wants
to take over himself.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.500
I can't let him do that.

11:24.583 --> 11:25.875
But I won't turn him over
to Clark, either.

11:25.958 --> 11:27.375
He'd be dead in a second.

11:27.458 --> 11:28.917
Someone like you,
in-in your position

11:29.000 --> 11:30.167
you could intervene
on his behalf

11:30.250 --> 11:31.458
get him the proper treatment.

11:31.542 --> 11:33.417
Not to sound
totally self-involved

11:33.500 --> 11:35.083
but what's in it for me?

11:35.167 --> 11:36.292
If I give him protection

11:36.375 --> 11:38.917
I see plenty of risk,
but no profit.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.625
(Garibaldi)
'You get to be the hero.'

11:40.708 --> 11:43.250
It's good for business,
good for Earth

11:43.333 --> 11:46.583
and the next guy in office
is gonna owe you big time.

11:46.667 --> 11:50.125
I mean, who knows, you could be
the next guy in office.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.958
It's an intriguing
proposition, Michael.

11:55.042 --> 11:56.333
Let me think about it.

11:56.417 --> 11:59.042
You are half way
to the truth.

11:59.125 --> 12:00.583
I have to decide
whether or not

12:00.667 --> 12:02.833
to bring you
the rest of the way.

12:02.917 --> 12:04.917
But just so you understand

12:05.000 --> 12:08.583
I won't do anything
until I know I can trust you.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.625
'And I suspect
you won't do anything'

12:10.708 --> 12:12.542
'until you know
you can trust me.'

12:13.917 --> 12:16.417
This is gonna be a very
interesting weekend

12:16.500 --> 12:18.625
Mr. Garibaldi.

12:27.458 --> 12:29.250
This is where
you'll bunk for now.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.167
Oh, no, come on,
I couldn't possibly.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.292
It's just much too big.

12:33.375 --> 12:34.917
Well, I could change
that if, uh..

12:35.000 --> 12:36.417
No, no, no,
that's alright.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.750
Please, don't inconvenience
yourself on my behalf.

12:40.417 --> 12:42.667
Alright, when do I get
to see Edgars again?

12:42.750 --> 12:44.875
- When he sends for you.
- Which is when?

12:44.958 --> 12:48.000
Which is five minutes after
he sends for me to send for you.

12:49.417 --> 12:51.292
Goodnight, Mr. Garibaldi.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.708
Try not to touch anything.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.792
"Try not to touch anything."

13:03.000 --> 13:06.250
There, touch that.

13:06.333 --> 13:09.167
Touching. See? Touching.
I'm touching. I'm touching.

13:09.250 --> 13:12.083
Touch, touch, touch. Touch.

13:13.875 --> 13:15.458
[sighs]

13:18.083 --> 13:20.292
[sighs]
Oh, man.

13:23.167 --> 13:24.833
[exhales]

13:29.333 --> 13:32.250
- Lyta, wait up.
- I can't, I'm late.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.917
No, this is, this will
just take a minute.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.292
Look, I am sorry
I messed up your experiment

13:36.375 --> 13:38.958
whatever you were doing
back there, I don't know--

13:39.042 --> 13:40.625
Is that why you ran off
like that?

13:40.708 --> 13:41.792
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.

13:41.875 --> 13:43.208
You didn't mess anything up.

13:43.292 --> 13:45.958
You got a reaction out
of one of my patients.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.875
For those few seconds
he was conscious and responding

13:48.958 --> 13:51.542
without being a danger
to himself or to others.

13:51.625 --> 13:52.958
I'd like to know
how you did it.

13:53.042 --> 13:55.917
I was just looking
at him, and..

13:56.000 --> 13:58.583
...I heard a sound
in my head.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.167
What kind of sound?

14:00.250 --> 14:02.208
Well, it's..

14:02.292 --> 14:04.792
...I don't even know
if you're gonna believe me.

14:04.875 --> 14:06.958
It sounded like the scream
a Shadow vessel makes

14:07.042 --> 14:09.625
when it goes by.

14:09.708 --> 14:12.667
When I heard it,
I just reacted instinctively.

14:12.750 --> 14:15.417
I-I made it go away.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.000
That's when he woke up.

14:18.083 --> 14:20.333
Interesting.

14:20.417 --> 14:22.000
Look, can you come back
after this other job?

14:22.083 --> 14:23.708
- I'd like to run some tests.
- No, I'm, I--

14:23.792 --> 14:27.083
Lyta, please, look, now,
they're your own people.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.458
Alright, they're telepaths.

14:28.542 --> 14:30.125
Now, I know you have problems
with the corps

14:30.208 --> 14:32.792
but...you should at least
try and help them.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Alright.
I'll see what I can do.

14:41.917 --> 14:43.875
[dramatic music]

14:46.500 --> 14:47.958
[gasps]

14:48.042 --> 14:49.958
Hey! Hey!
What the hell?

14:50.042 --> 14:52.042
Come on!
What the hell's going on?

14:52.125 --> 14:54.708
Let me go! Let me go.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.292
Hey! Hey!

14:56.375 --> 14:58.625
[doorknob clanking]

14:58.708 --> 15:00.667
(William)
'Don't be concerned,
Mr. Garibaldi.'

15:00.750 --> 15:02.333
'Everything's fine.'

15:02.417 --> 15:04.792
'You're in no imminent danger.'

15:04.875 --> 15:07.583
Yeah, thanks
for the reassurance.

15:07.667 --> 15:10.458
[heavy breathing]
So, who is she?

15:10.542 --> 15:12.875
What's she doin' here?

15:12.958 --> 15:15.167
(William)
'She is a telepath,
Mr. Garibaldi.'

15:15.250 --> 15:17.667
'She knows nothing
of our situation here'

15:17.750 --> 15:19.292
'or our discussion.'

15:19.375 --> 15:21.792
'I have hired her
for a surface scan only.'

15:21.875 --> 15:23.583
'She will not probe deeply'

15:23.667 --> 15:26.042
'will not know the context
of our discussion.'

15:26.125 --> 15:27.500
'She will only tell me'

15:27.583 --> 15:30.000
'if you are telling me
the truth when you answer.'

15:30.083 --> 15:31.667
'Do you understand?'

15:31.750 --> 15:35.167
Oh, yeah, I understand.
So why the muscle?

15:35.250 --> 15:37.708
(William)
'So you'd have no time
to prepare mentally.'

15:37.792 --> 15:40.875
'I want your heart rate fast,
your thoughts jumbled'

15:40.958 --> 15:45.000
'to guard against any blocks
or attempts to mislead us.'

15:45.083 --> 15:47.375
'Now, for starters.'

15:47.458 --> 15:50.542
'I want you to tell me what
you think about telepaths.'

15:52.625 --> 15:54.500
Telepaths?

15:58.167 --> 15:59.625
Well, I, uh..

15:59.708 --> 16:02.125
(William)
'Feel free to be honest,
Mr. Garibaldi.'

16:02.208 --> 16:03.875
'Her job is to report'

16:03.958 --> 16:06.708
'not to be offended
by your opinions.'

16:06.792 --> 16:08.250
'Go on.'

16:09.875 --> 16:14.333
I don't trust them.
Never have, never will.

16:14.417 --> 16:15.833
(William)
'Why?'

16:15.917 --> 16:17.583
I don't like the idea
of somebody having the power

16:17.667 --> 16:19.375
'to get inside my head.'

16:19.458 --> 16:21.375
(William)
'There are safeguards,
you know.'

16:21.458 --> 16:24.375
They're not worth a damn
to anybody.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.042
They'll never trust us.

16:26.125 --> 16:29.042
We'll always be jealous
of them, afraid of them.

16:29.125 --> 16:30.458
They could lie to us,
and we'd never know

16:30.542 --> 16:33.583
but if we lie to them,
they know.

16:33.667 --> 16:34.875
'How do you stop a conspiracy'

16:34.958 --> 16:37.875
when you have
no evidence, no record.

16:37.958 --> 16:39.583
It all takes place in thoughts

16:39.667 --> 16:43.833
exchanged from one telepath
to another..

16:43.917 --> 16:45.750
'...to another.'

16:47.875 --> 16:50.292
Sooner or later,
this is gonna get ugly.

16:50.375 --> 16:53.167
I just hope I'm not alive
to see it happen.

16:53.250 --> 16:56.458
(William)
'Then you believe
they're a menace to society?'

16:58.375 --> 17:00.625
They're the biggest one
we've got.

17:00.708 --> 17:03.083
(William)
'When you told me
you wanted to help me locate'

17:03.167 --> 17:06.250
'and, uh, secure someone'

17:06.333 --> 17:08.208
'were you telling the truth?'

17:08.292 --> 17:09.458
Yes.

17:09.542 --> 17:11.167
(William)
'And you have a guaranteed'

17:11.250 --> 17:13.042
'means of doing this?'

17:13.125 --> 17:14.875
I do.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.292
(William)
'You said you wanted to know'

17:21.375 --> 17:23.750
'the real reason
behind your employment.'

17:23.833 --> 17:25.458
'I've already given you
a reason'

17:25.542 --> 17:27.958
'to keep the pharmaceuticals
now under development'

17:28.042 --> 17:30.125
'by my company
safe from competitors.'

17:30.208 --> 17:32.208
'Why isn't that
a good enough reason?'

17:32.292 --> 17:34.125
Because if somebody in your
position wants to protect

17:34.208 --> 17:35.708
something you pay off
the big boys

17:35.792 --> 17:38.458
and they give you a whole
damn ship to yourself.

17:38.542 --> 17:41.167
You only hire a guy like me
if you've got something to hide.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.542
It's not your competitors
you're worried about..

17:47.000 --> 17:49.458
...it's your neck
if you get caught.

17:49.542 --> 17:52.958
- 'So you assume I'm lying?'
- Everybody lies.

17:53.042 --> 17:56.792
(William)
'That's a very sad view of
the universe, Mr. Garibaldi.'

17:56.875 --> 17:59.708
Yeah, well,
it's the only one I got.

17:59.792 --> 18:01.583
And it works for me.

18:01.667 --> 18:04.375
(William)
'I understand you disappeared
from Babylon 5'

18:04.458 --> 18:07.292
'for some time
this past January.'

18:07.375 --> 18:09.667
'Do you know
what happened to you?'

18:09.750 --> 18:13.167
Tsk, no.
I don't remember anything.

18:18.750 --> 18:21.875
(William)
'Thank you, Mr. Garibaldi.
You may go now.'

18:21.958 --> 18:23.542
[doorknob clanking]

18:26.500 --> 18:28.375
'Uh, one more thing.'

18:28.458 --> 18:31.167
'Are you still in love
with my wife?'

18:31.250 --> 18:32.542
What?

18:32.625 --> 18:34.125
(William)
'It's a very straight-forward'

18:34.208 --> 18:35.417
'question, Mr. Garibaldi.'

18:35.500 --> 18:37.625
'Are you still in love
with my wife?'

18:42.917 --> 18:44.875
No.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.542
No, I'm not.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.125
(William)
'Thank you.'

18:48.208 --> 18:50.083
'You may return
to your room now.'

18:50.167 --> 18:53.000
[instrumental music]

19:03.958 --> 19:05.708
(William)
'Thank you, Ms. Constance.'

19:05.792 --> 19:08.292
'Mr. Wade will attend
to your payment.'

19:17.417 --> 19:19.167
You should be in bed.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.292
I couldn't sleep.

19:21.375 --> 19:22.667
Did it go alright?

19:22.750 --> 19:25.042
Fine, fine.

19:25.125 --> 19:28.167
Did he, uh,
say anything about me?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.375
No, it never came up.

19:30.458 --> 19:33.000
I think he's put it
all behind him.

19:33.083 --> 19:34.917
Good.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.750
That's good.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.583
As long as you're
comfortable with him.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.833
I think
he'd be a fine addition.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.875
Don't worry.

19:46.125 --> 19:48.333
Everything's
gonna be just fine.

19:51.042 --> 19:53.875
[instrumental music]

20:08.833 --> 20:10.375
Alright, almost ready,
just one more.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.083
What do you want me to do?

20:12.167 --> 20:14.667
(Franklin)
'Well, do whatever you did
the first time'

20:14.750 --> 20:16.792
'just do it more slowly.'

20:16.875 --> 20:19.500
'I wanna be able to monitor
any changes in his brain waves'

20:19.583 --> 20:23.125
caused by direct contact
with your thoughts.

20:23.208 --> 20:26.250
With any luck, this will help me
find a way to stimulate

20:26.333 --> 20:28.958
those same brain waves
artificially.

20:29.042 --> 20:31.833
Build a kind
of a feedback loop.

20:31.917 --> 20:34.042
If it works..

20:34.125 --> 20:36.708
...at least we'll be able
to communicate with him.

20:36.792 --> 20:39.458
What about the implants?

20:39.542 --> 20:41.458
Getting those out
will take longer.

20:41.542 --> 20:44.500
But if we can work
around the implants

20:44.583 --> 20:46.417
'talk to them without them
turning violent'

20:46.500 --> 20:50.208
or uncontrollable,
that'll be a start.

20:50.292 --> 20:53.458
Alright.
I think I'm ready.

20:53.542 --> 20:55.208
Computer, begin recording.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.458
Alright, now, remember,
take it slow.

20:59.542 --> 21:02.583
I need to see what you do
at every stage, alright?

Alright, 15% increase
in respiration and heartbeat..

Ea-ease up a little, alright?
Take him up slow.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.792
(Franklin)
Interesting.

21:39.875 --> 21:41.458
Every time you push
telepathically

21:41.542 --> 21:43.583
it slows down the production
of Acetylcholine.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.542
The implants may be stimulating

21:46.625 --> 21:48.167
the production of brain
accelerants

21:48.250 --> 21:49.875
making it work faster.

or direction'

the brain functions
become erratic or distorted.

21:58.833 --> 22:01.875
They start casting about,
looking for something to do.

22:01.958 --> 22:04.042
And when it doesn't find it,
it, it starts tearing

It's alright. You're safe.
No one's gonna hurt you.

The machines...are gone?

22:29.958 --> 22:31.917
Yeah...yes, the machines..

...the Shadow vessels are gone.
They're not gonna h-hurt you.

22:35.833 --> 22:37.667
Then...what am I?

22:37.750 --> 22:39.583
Uh!

22:39.667 --> 22:41.417
Why am I..

22:42.750 --> 22:44.417
Oh!

22:49.500 --> 22:51.917
I can't live like this.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.542
[instrumental music]

23:03.875 --> 23:05.792
I can't..

23:05.875 --> 23:08.125
...let you do that.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.958
(Lyta)
I'm sorry.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.625
Go to sleep now.

23:14.917 --> 23:17.458
[intense music]

23:28.708 --> 23:30.917
(William)
'Ah, Mr. Garibaldi,
good morning.'

23:31.000 --> 23:33.250
Good morning.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.583
Would you like
some orange juice?

23:35.667 --> 23:37.250
'Costs a fortune
to have it shipped up'

23:37.333 --> 23:39.000
'but, uh,
people in my position'

23:39.083 --> 23:41.583
'are expected to have
a few eccentricities.'

23:42.958 --> 23:45.750
When I was a kid, I spent
my summers with my uncle

23:45.833 --> 23:49.208
on a farm in Valencia,
California.

23:49.292 --> 23:52.042
We always had fresh orange juice
every morning on the table.

23:53.667 --> 23:55.458
Those were good years.

23:55.542 --> 23:56.792
Simpler.

23:56.875 --> 23:58.458
A lot simpler.

23:58.542 --> 24:00.000
Ah.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.208
Look, I, uh,
I went through your test.

24:02.292 --> 24:04.958
I assume I passed,
or we wouldn't be standing here.

24:05.042 --> 24:07.250
I did my part, now do yours.

24:07.333 --> 24:09.208
What's this all about?

24:09.292 --> 24:12.167
Do you know how the ancient
Greeks defined happiness?

24:13.417 --> 24:14.958
Not off hand,
but I'd be willing to bet

24:15.042 --> 24:17.708
it involved three goats
and a jug of wine.

24:17.792 --> 24:21.500
Happiness, they said was
"The exercise of vital powers

24:21.583 --> 24:26.125
along lines of excellence,
in a life affording them scope."

24:26.208 --> 24:28.042
Humans have always struggled

24:28.125 --> 24:30.083
to find the outer edge
of what's possible

24:30.167 --> 24:32.958
and that's our strength.

24:33.042 --> 24:35.042
But what kind of world
would we have

24:35.125 --> 24:38.458
what-what options for happiness
would we have

24:38.542 --> 24:41.875
'in a society run by telepaths
where ordinary humans'

24:41.958 --> 24:45.208
are considered second-class
citizens and privacy

24:45.292 --> 24:48.500
is something you don't even risk
dreaming about?

24:48.583 --> 24:51.625
Would you like to live in that
kind of world, Mr. Garibaldi?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.625
No. No, I wouldn't.

24:55.708 --> 24:58.250
But you know it's coming,
don't you?

24:58.333 --> 24:59.708
There are a few Psi Cops
out there

24:59.792 --> 25:01.375
who think they should
be running the whole show

25:01.458 --> 25:03.167
but they don't have anywhere
near the kind of power

25:03.250 --> 25:04.417
to pull off
anything like this.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.167
Not yet, but that's changing.

25:07.250 --> 25:09.250
Come on, look, uh,
even if they tried something

25:09.333 --> 25:11.167
they'd be outnumbered
10,000 to 1.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.917
You're thinking in old terms,
the force of arms.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.167
But times have changed.

25:15.250 --> 25:17.250
We're talking a war
of information.

25:17.333 --> 25:21.375
A war of secrets.
A war of intimidation.

25:21.458 --> 25:23.875
Once they take off
those badges

25:23.958 --> 25:26.750
can you tell a telepath
from a normal?

25:26.833 --> 25:28.417
They don't
have to be everywhere

25:28.500 --> 25:31.250
'to make people believe, they
might be living next door.'

25:31.333 --> 25:33.583
You want your secrets exposed

25:33.667 --> 25:35.125
your most private thoughts

25:35.208 --> 25:37.458
broadcast
for the world to hear?

25:37.542 --> 25:38.792
No, but it can't--

25:38.875 --> 25:40.125
How many people actually

25:40.208 --> 25:42.042
belonged to the Nazi Party?

25:42.125 --> 25:45.125
The Communist party?
The Jihad party?

25:45.208 --> 25:47.708
A very small number.

25:47.792 --> 25:49.833
But there were always
plenty of other people

25:49.917 --> 25:53.000
who were happy
to do the work for them.

25:53.083 --> 25:55.917
And others afraid enough
to let it happen.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.458
In order for them to take power,
they'd need an army.

25:58.542 --> 26:00.708
Huh, you're still laboring
under the notion

26:00.792 --> 26:03.750
that people take power.
Nobody takes power.

26:03.833 --> 26:06.250
They're given power
by the rest of us.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.958
Because we're stupid
or afraid or both.

26:09.042 --> 26:13.458
The Germans in 1939.
The Russians in 1917 and 2013.

26:13.542 --> 26:16.958
The Iraqis in 2025.
The French in 2112.

26:17.042 --> 26:19.125
They handed over power
to people

26:19.208 --> 26:20.958
they thought
could settle scores.

26:21.042 --> 26:23.125
Get the trains
running on time.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.542
'Restore their prestige.'

26:25.625 --> 26:29.083
They did it because it was
wanted.

26:29.167 --> 26:31.708
Afterwards, like children
who have eaten too much candy

26:31.792 --> 26:33.917
after dinner, they denied
it was their fault.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.083
No, it was them. Ha ha.

26:36.167 --> 26:37.875
'It's always them.'

26:37.958 --> 26:40.000
Today President Clark
has the power

26:40.083 --> 26:41.333
and we gave it to him.

26:41.417 --> 26:43.083
Because we're afraid
of the aliens

26:43.167 --> 26:46.125
and afraid of ourselves.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.333
And now he's giving it
to the telepaths.

26:48.417 --> 26:51.333
Clark wants complete
and total loyalty.

26:51.417 --> 26:54.833
When he was vice president,
he instituted loyalty tests.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.958
But you can fool a test.

26:57.042 --> 26:58.833
You can't fool a telepath.

26:58.917 --> 27:02.333
'So he started bringing
them into the process.'

27:02.417 --> 27:05.625
President Santiago objected,
but he made the mistake

27:05.708 --> 27:07.542
of underestimating
the opposition.

27:07.625 --> 27:09.000
Clark wanted power.

27:09.083 --> 27:11.583
Oh, I don't have
a problem with that.

27:11.667 --> 27:14.583
No one but a fool ever walked
away from real power.

27:14.667 --> 27:17.875
But he began taking
unacceptable risks.

27:17.958 --> 27:21.667
He eliminated Santiago
with outside help.

27:21.750 --> 27:23.500
I don't know the full story.

27:23.583 --> 27:26.042
Only that there
were aliens involved

27:26.125 --> 27:29.292
and they promised him
all the power he could want.

27:29.375 --> 27:31.167
But he wanted an ace or two
up his sleeve.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.333
He knew they were interested
in the Psi Corps.

27:33.417 --> 27:36.458
And if they were interested,
then he was interested.

27:36.542 --> 27:39.042
They were his insurance policy
against the aliens

27:39.125 --> 27:41.875
and his means
for gaining more power.

27:41.958 --> 27:43.958
He created the Nightwatch

27:44.042 --> 27:46.583
'started putting his people
into important positions'

27:46.667 --> 27:49.750
'with telepaths alongside
for security.'

27:49.833 --> 27:52.292
He gave them
unprecedented authority.

27:52.375 --> 27:54.583
And if you think
they'll let go of that power

27:54.667 --> 27:57.542
once he's gone,
you're gravely mistaken.

27:57.625 --> 27:59.958
But what does Captain Sheridan
have to do with all this?

28:00.042 --> 28:02.750
If Sheridan tries
to force a military showdown

28:02.833 --> 28:04.500
Clark will cut the final ties

28:04.583 --> 28:05.958
that hold the Psi Corps
in check.

28:06.042 --> 28:07.917
He'll turn it into a military
and police force

28:08.000 --> 28:10.375
answerable only to him.

28:10.458 --> 28:13.208
- Thought police.
- Exactly.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.292
Once that happens..

28:15.375 --> 28:17.125
...they'll never let go.

28:18.583 --> 28:20.583
There are..

28:20.667 --> 28:23.750
...other ways to fix this.

28:23.833 --> 28:25.042
Clark's an amateur.

28:25.125 --> 28:27.083
He still thinks he's in charge.

28:27.167 --> 28:28.250
Isn't he?

28:28.333 --> 28:29.875
Megacorporation's have been

28:29.958 --> 28:32.208
running things for years.

28:32.292 --> 28:33.792
We just don't
show ourselves much.

28:33.875 --> 28:35.292
People wouldn't understand.

28:35.375 --> 28:39.125
So we let them think
they still have a voice.

28:39.208 --> 28:41.542
'We let Clark have his way
because we didn't see'

28:41.625 --> 28:45.417
this telepath thing coming
until it was too late.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.833
Now it's a threat
to our business interests

28:47.917 --> 28:50.625
and we'll fix it
in our own way.

28:50.708 --> 28:53.375
Quietly.
Behind the scenes.

28:54.708 --> 28:58.625
We just need a little more time
to make this work.

28:58.708 --> 29:02.625
Sheridan's campaign threatens
to disrupt our timetable.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.167
He's just making Clark
more paranoid

29:04.250 --> 29:05.833
by giving him a real enemy.

29:05.917 --> 29:07.083
And the more paranoid he gets

29:07.167 --> 29:09.167
the more power he gives
to the Psi Corps.

29:09.250 --> 29:10.500
But how do you stop
the corps--

29:10.583 --> 29:12.333
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.417
I didn't know
that you were, uh..

29:15.500 --> 29:18.208
I just came here to tell you
that breakfast is ready.

29:18.292 --> 29:20.833
Huh, that's fine, Lise,
I'll be right there.

29:20.917 --> 29:22.667
Perhaps you'd care
to join us.

29:22.750 --> 29:25.000
Uh, no, thank you.

29:25.083 --> 29:26.625
I've got some thinking to do.

29:26.708 --> 29:30.000
- I'm sure you have.
- Uh, Mr. Edgars?

29:30.083 --> 29:31.333
One minute..

29:33.500 --> 29:36.000
What you just told me,
is that the whole truth?

29:36.083 --> 29:37.500
It's as close to the truth

29:37.583 --> 29:40.250
as you or anyone else
will ever get, Mr. Garibaldi.

29:40.333 --> 29:42.125
But it should be enough
for you to decide

29:42.208 --> 29:46.000
if you can trust me
the way I now trust you.

29:46.083 --> 29:48.667
Once you decide,
you're in all the way.

29:48.750 --> 29:50.208
'I'll tell you the rest.'

29:50.292 --> 29:53.667
We're gonna change the world,
Mr. Garibaldi.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.458
I hope you'll work with me.

29:55.542 --> 29:58.125
[instrumental music]

30:08.083 --> 30:10.542
- How's everything else?
- So far, so good.

30:10.625 --> 30:12.208
Clark sent over a couple
of destroyers this morning

30:12.292 --> 30:13.667
trying to weaken our defenses.

30:13.750 --> 30:15.167
What happened?

30:15.250 --> 30:16.708
'They changed sides
as soon as they got here.'

30:16.792 --> 30:17.875
We sent them your way,
they should catch up

30:17.958 --> 30:19.458
with you by the next jump point.

30:19.542 --> 30:21.750
That's five so far today. Huh.

30:21.833 --> 30:24.208
Any more defections
and this little war

30:24.292 --> 30:26.292
is gonna be really one-sided.

30:26.375 --> 30:28.875
- You sound disappointed.
- I'm not.

30:28.958 --> 30:31.958
I just start to worry
when things are going too well.

30:32.042 --> 30:33.458
Any word from Delenn?

30:33.542 --> 30:36.542
She finished her work on Minbar,
she's heading back here.

30:36.625 --> 30:38.750
She should be arriving
in a couple of days.

30:38.833 --> 30:41.542
Good.
Anything else?

30:41.625 --> 30:43.792
Nope, all quiet
on the Epsilon front.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.458
Is there anything else
you want me to do from this end?

30:45.542 --> 30:47.542
Yeah, transfer me
over to Stephen.

30:47.625 --> 30:49.500
I wanna see how he's doing
with the telepaths.

30:51.167 --> 30:52.333
[computer beeps]

30:52.417 --> 30:53.542
Not now.

30:53.625 --> 30:55.375
(Ivanova)
'Stephen, it's the captain.'

30:56.833 --> 30:58.417
'Stephen?'

30:58.500 --> 31:00.625
Alright, alright.

31:00.708 --> 31:02.583
Just a sec.

31:02.667 --> 31:04.667
Stephen, I just thought
I'd check in

31:04.750 --> 31:07.417
see how things were going.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.708
I, uh...think I found a way

31:09.792 --> 31:12.833
to neutralize the implants
for brief periods of time.

31:12.917 --> 31:15.250
We're setting up a, uh,
an amplifier system

31:15.333 --> 31:19.292
that will echo Lyta's
telepathic commands and..

31:19.375 --> 31:21.750
Look, it's-it's-it's really
complicated right now

31:21.833 --> 31:23.417
and I'm trying to keep it
all in my head, so..

31:23.500 --> 31:25.292
When do you think you can get
them up and running?

31:25.375 --> 31:26.958
[sighs]
I don't know.

31:27.042 --> 31:28.375
This is important, Stephen.

31:28.458 --> 31:30.833
Why? Why is this so important?

31:30.917 --> 31:32.292
Now if you want me
to do this right

31:32.375 --> 31:33.792
I need to know
what this is all about!

31:33.875 --> 31:36.000
- Stephen--
- 'I mean it.'

31:40.000 --> 31:41.542
Alright.

31:41.625 --> 31:43.375
I'm encoding this message
every three seconds

31:43.458 --> 31:45.875
so program your system
to keep up.

31:45.958 --> 31:48.750
Are there any other
personnel around?

31:48.833 --> 31:50.292
Well, yeah, a few, but, uh..

31:50.375 --> 31:52.750
This is private.

31:52.833 --> 31:55.042
Alright, everybody,
uh, take a break.

31:55.125 --> 31:58.292
Uh, get something to eat,
uh, grab some sleep

31:58.375 --> 31:59.792
just-just go.

31:59.875 --> 32:02.333
Come on, hurry up,
everybody, let's go.

32:02.417 --> 32:03.875
Go, go, go.

32:05.583 --> 32:08.208
Alright, go ahead.

32:08.292 --> 32:11.875
Stephen, I've asked some
hard things of you in the past

32:11.958 --> 32:14.458
this may be
the hardest of all.

32:14.542 --> 32:17.208
I don't think
you're gonna like it.

32:17.292 --> 32:19.042
But we don't have much choice.

32:21.625 --> 32:24.708
[instrumental music]

32:31.000 --> 32:32.500
Stephen.

32:35.375 --> 32:38.042
Are you alright?

32:38.125 --> 32:39.583
No.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.583
No, I am definitely
not alright.

32:49.417 --> 32:51.792
You know, when Sheridan
came back from Z'ha'dum

32:51.875 --> 32:54.417
everyone talked about
how different he was.

32:55.417 --> 32:57.042
Harder.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.667
More determined.

33:00.958 --> 33:02.708
I really didn't see it.

33:04.375 --> 33:05.833
I mean, aside from the..

33:07.167 --> 33:10.208
...from some
physiological changes

33:10.292 --> 33:12.500
it was Sheridan, same as ever.

33:15.292 --> 33:17.417
The Sheridan I know,
he never would have told me

33:17.500 --> 33:19.250
what this one just did.

33:25.250 --> 33:28.000
[sighs]
Oh. He's right.
He's right.

33:28.083 --> 33:31.500
It's the only way. I just wish
the hell that he was wrong.

33:35.917 --> 33:38.208
I have a long-term job
for you, you available?

33:40.083 --> 33:41.583
Good.

33:41.667 --> 33:43.500
Start packing,
we leave in a few days.

33:43.583 --> 33:45.583
As soon as I take care
of everything.

33:45.667 --> 33:47.000
Where are we going?

33:50.083 --> 33:51.750
Mars.

33:53.250 --> 33:55.792
[intense music]

33:59.667 --> 34:01.750
[knock on door]

34:01.833 --> 34:03.292
Yeah?

34:05.208 --> 34:06.708
You missed your dinner,
I thought I'd bring you

34:06.792 --> 34:08.792
some food.

34:15.833 --> 34:17.417
You know, when I look
at you two together

34:17.500 --> 34:19.958
I just can't figure it out.

34:20.042 --> 34:21.958
I mean, aside from having
more money than God

34:22.042 --> 34:25.917
and having homes on Mars, Earth,
IO, and who knows where else

34:26.000 --> 34:28.458
having fresh orange juice
delivered all the way from Earth

34:28.542 --> 34:31.583
just so he can
relive his youth..

34:31.667 --> 34:33.125
...what does he have
that I don't have?

34:33.208 --> 34:34.708
Why him instead of me?

34:34.792 --> 34:36.542
- Michael.
- Is it the money?

34:36.625 --> 34:38.125
No!

34:40.000 --> 34:41.958
Do you love him?

34:42.042 --> 34:43.958
Yes.

34:44.042 --> 34:46.875
Yes, I do, he's a good man.

34:46.958 --> 34:49.667
Well, then why did you warn me
off when I first got here?

34:49.750 --> 34:51.667
I'm just concerned, that's all.

34:51.750 --> 34:54.000
I don't know
all of what's going on.

34:54.083 --> 34:57.542
But I know he's putting himself
at risk, reaching too far.

34:57.625 --> 35:00.292
I don't want anything
to happen to him.

35:00.375 --> 35:02.125
Or you.

35:05.125 --> 35:06.500
Well..

35:06.583 --> 35:08.417
...at least
you're concerned now.

35:10.292 --> 35:12.208
You know, when you got free..

35:12.292 --> 35:13.833
...you could-you could
have told me.

35:13.917 --> 35:16.292
Maybe we could've got back
some of what we had before.

35:16.375 --> 35:20.000
I never knew what we had,
when we were together before

35:20.083 --> 35:21.583
I never knew
when I'd see you again

35:21.667 --> 35:23.750
I'd ever see you again!

35:23.833 --> 35:26.333
'I was the one who always had
to carry the relationship.'

35:26.417 --> 35:27.875
I was the one who had to call.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.958
I was the one who had to remind
you when Christmas came around

35:30.042 --> 35:31.708
that while it doesn't
mean anything to you

35:31.792 --> 35:33.667
'it means a whole hell
of a lot to me.'

35:33.750 --> 35:35.917
Until I finally woke up
and realized

35:36.000 --> 35:38.625
that people like you
don't marry other people.

35:38.708 --> 35:41.583
You marry the job,
24 hours a day

35:41.667 --> 35:44.208
'and everybody else
is just excess baggage.'

35:44.292 --> 35:47.458
- I never said that to you.
- No.

35:47.542 --> 35:50.708
But in three years,
you never said you loved me

35:50.792 --> 35:52.458
until I said it to you first.

35:52.542 --> 35:55.583
And from where I sit,
that means the same damn thing.

36:08.167 --> 36:12.500
[voice breaking]
After Franz left, I was a mess..

36:12.583 --> 36:16.667
...and you were
18 light years away.

36:16.750 --> 36:19.917
'I was working as a secretary
to make ends meet'

36:20.000 --> 36:21.583
'when I found Bill.'

36:21.667 --> 36:24.417
He was kind, and he was gentle.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.458
And most of all,
he was there.

36:29.042 --> 36:30.625
If I had called you..

36:32.250 --> 36:33.500
...would you have left
Babylon 5

36:33.583 --> 36:35.750
and come back to Mars?

36:37.125 --> 36:38.500
'Would you?'

36:40.000 --> 36:41.542
I don't know.

36:43.083 --> 36:44.750
That's the problem, Michael.

36:46.250 --> 36:49.042
I'm getting too old
for I don't know.

36:52.125 --> 36:54.583
What I do know
is that Bill cares for me.

36:54.667 --> 36:56.542
No, Lise. Lise!

36:56.625 --> 36:59.292
Please listen.

36:59.375 --> 37:01.167
Listen, I am sorry.

37:02.917 --> 37:06.250
I am so, so sorry.

37:06.333 --> 37:08.625
[sniffles]
I never meant to hurt you.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.792
I loved you.

37:14.625 --> 37:16.542
I don't think
I ever really stopped.

37:19.167 --> 37:21.250
I'm sorry, too.

37:26.750 --> 37:28.917
Eat your dinner.
It'll get cold.

37:30.542 --> 37:33.625
[instrumental music]

37:44.000 --> 37:45.833
Mr. Edgars.

37:45.917 --> 37:48.000
Shouldn't you be resting?
You've had a long day.

37:48.083 --> 37:50.458
I just thought I'd see
how things were going.

37:51.917 --> 37:55.917
We're at a critical stage.
Can't afford any mistakes.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.833
- I wish you wouldn't.
- It's alright.

38:08.917 --> 38:11.250
It's a terrible thing
to die alone, Wade.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.750
'We can afford a little
human compassion.'

38:14.833 --> 38:16.417
'He can't infect me.'

38:18.000 --> 38:19.958
How long has he been
off the drug?

38:20.042 --> 38:22.042
- Five days.
- Hmm.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.917
Symptoms are occurring
faster than before.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.042
[indistinct chatter]

38:27.125 --> 38:30.125
I know.
I know it hurts.

38:30.208 --> 38:32.250
Part of the process.

38:32.333 --> 38:35.833
'I can only tell you
it'll be over soon.'

38:43.875 --> 38:46.375
I want him put down.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.708
Shouldn't they finish the tests?

38:47.792 --> 38:48.833
We know it works.

38:48.917 --> 38:50.458
There's no need to prolong this.

38:50.542 --> 38:52.292
Put him down, put them all down.

38:53.542 --> 38:56.125
There's enough pain
in the universe already.

38:59.458 --> 39:02.000
Let's not add to it
until we have to.

39:02.083 --> 39:04.625
[intense music]

39:23.208 --> 39:26.542
Oh, Mr. Garibaldi. Sorry, I-I,
I didn't hear you come in.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.417
I-I didn't mean to bother you,
I can come back another--

39:28.500 --> 39:31.083
No, no, no, it's fine.

39:31.167 --> 39:32.667
You're up late.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.875
Yeah, uh..

39:37.792 --> 39:41.792
...I've just been thinking
about a lot of things.

39:41.875 --> 39:44.083
And where have
your thoughts brought you?

39:45.458 --> 39:46.792
Well, you told me
to let you know

39:46.875 --> 39:49.917
when I decided
when I'm in all the way.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.417
I've decided. I'm in.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.125
Well, I'm very pleased
to hear that.

39:56.208 --> 39:58.250
So what's the rest?

39:59.875 --> 40:03.292
Well, you told me you'd tell me
the rest of it when I decided.

40:03.375 --> 40:05.625
Saying you've decided
isn't the same thing

40:05.708 --> 40:09.042
as demonstrating your sincerity.

40:09.125 --> 40:10.958
You showed me a little
of that earlier

40:11.042 --> 40:15.000
and I returned the favor.
Now it's your turn again.

40:15.083 --> 40:18.000
Alright. So how do I prove
I'm in all the way?

40:18.083 --> 40:19.458
Give me Sheridan.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.708
'Let me turn him over
to President Clark.'

40:21.792 --> 40:24.167
Do that,
and I'll tell you the rest.

40:26.250 --> 40:27.917
What's the hurry? I mean..

40:28.000 --> 40:30.667
'We need Clark to think
he's secure in his position'

40:30.750 --> 40:33.625
'so we can buy some time
to get our pieces into place.'

40:33.708 --> 40:35.667
If we give him Sheridan,
he'll drop his guard

40:35.750 --> 40:38.833
then we can do
what we have to.

40:38.917 --> 40:40.167
I'll turn him over to you.

40:40.250 --> 40:41.667
I won't turn him over to Clark.
He'd be killed--

40:41.750 --> 40:44.542
Not before he can be
formally charged.

40:44.625 --> 40:46.667
Clark's an amateur, not a fool.

40:46.750 --> 40:49.500
He'll want to go through
the motions of a hearing.

40:49.583 --> 40:51.833
We'll move before that happens.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.708
[sighs]

40:53.792 --> 40:56.000
- You're asking a lot.
- I know.

40:56.083 --> 40:58.708
That's why we approached you
in the first place.

40:58.792 --> 41:00.458
You know him better
than most people

41:00.542 --> 41:03.542
and you recognize
the threat he represents.

41:03.625 --> 41:05.792
We have to take him
out of the picture.

41:05.875 --> 41:09.125
You know it, and I know it.
And now it's time.

41:09.208 --> 41:11.333
If you're sincere,
then prove it.

41:13.042 --> 41:15.333
If not, we have nothing
more to talk about.

41:23.333 --> 41:24.875
You get to Sheridan..

41:26.333 --> 41:27.708
...through his father.

41:27.792 --> 41:29.708
Nobody knows where he is.

41:29.792 --> 41:31.750
Clark's people have been
turning Earth upside down

41:31.833 --> 41:34.042
and haven't been able
to find him.

41:34.125 --> 41:36.875
They can't.
But I can.

41:38.708 --> 41:40.750
His father has a rare
blood disease.

41:40.833 --> 41:43.333
Requires he takes regular
injections of Tenastacine.

41:43.417 --> 41:44.792
'That's a Centauri drug.'

41:44.875 --> 41:46.625
We supply it to a number
of hospitals back home.

41:46.708 --> 41:49.125
Very rare. Very expensive.

41:49.208 --> 41:51.417
Which makes it easy to track.

41:51.500 --> 41:54.125
Wherever he goes, he has to keep
taking the medicine.

41:54.208 --> 41:56.417
My guess is he didn't have
enough time to buy a lot of it

41:56.500 --> 41:58.375
before he went into hiding.

41:58.458 --> 42:00.500
Now he probably has a friend
handling the prescription

42:00.583 --> 42:02.417
but it shouldn't take long
to find a bogus entry

42:02.500 --> 42:04.167
in the med records.

42:04.250 --> 42:07.750
You get him,
you can get Sheridan.

42:07.833 --> 42:09.333
We, uh..

42:09.417 --> 42:11.708
...we still need someone
to set him up..

42:13.500 --> 42:16.167
...and bring him down.

42:16.250 --> 42:18.333
I can do that.

42:18.417 --> 42:20.625
- 'Are you sure?'
- Yeah.

42:21.750 --> 42:24.250
I'm sure.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.958
I'll head back
to Dome 1 tomorrow

42:26.042 --> 42:28.833
start setting things up.

42:28.917 --> 42:31.500
You're doing the right thing,
Michael.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.458
I hope you understand that.

42:44.250 --> 42:47.958
Three times before,
this place almost killed me.

42:48.042 --> 42:49.292
And now..

42:49.375 --> 42:52.167
...I've finally
finished the job.

42:52.250 --> 42:54.750
I can't feel anything anymore.

42:54.833 --> 42:57.625
I don't know
what I care about anymore.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.458
Except Lise.

42:59.542 --> 43:01.833
I screwed up
both our lives pretty good.

43:01.917 --> 43:03.792
Now I get to make up for it.

43:03.875 --> 43:05.542
Assuming any of us
can ever make up

43:05.625 --> 43:08.167
for anything
we've done in the past.

43:08.250 --> 43:09.833
Maybe we can't.

43:09.917 --> 43:11.500
Maybe we just
have to live with it

43:11.583 --> 43:12.958
and get on with it

43:13.042 --> 43:16.250
and do what we have to,
never what we want to.

43:18.250 --> 43:20.500
It has to be done.

43:20.583 --> 43:22.500
I hope he can see
that someday.
