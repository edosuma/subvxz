WEBVTT

00:00.433 --> 00:03.501
And so, in conclusion,

00:03.502 --> 00:06.004
I'd like to emphasize
once again...

00:06.005 --> 00:07.739
Thank you, heidi.
You're welcome.

00:07.740 --> 00:10.041
...That if your home
is lightly trafficked,

00:10.042 --> 00:13.144
You can't go wrong
with a saxony plush carpet.

00:13.145 --> 00:17.749
As you can see,
it's very luxurious,
has a nice nap.

00:17.750 --> 00:21.019
I think the audience
just had a nice nap.

00:22.454 --> 00:23.955
I think not.

00:23.956 --> 00:26.457
Choosing a carpet
is a very important decision.

00:26.458 --> 00:29.327
It's something
you have to live with
and walk on for years.

00:29.328 --> 00:31.429
So are you, al.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.765
On the other hand,

00:33.766 --> 00:36.434
If your carpet
is heavily trafficked,

00:36.435 --> 00:38.937
Well, you can't go wrong
with a nice berber.

00:38.938 --> 00:40.939
And here we have
a lovely example,

00:40.940 --> 00:43.274
A nice wheat-colored berber.

00:43.275 --> 00:46.878
Berber's nice 'cause
you don't have to cut it.
You just go to a berber shop.

00:46.879 --> 00:49.313
Are you quite through
joking around?

00:49.314 --> 00:53.118
Yes. I was just trying
to stay awake till we get
to the good part - the tools.

00:53.119 --> 00:54.986
Al, tell us about the tools.

00:54.987 --> 00:58.356
These are the tools of the trade
when you're putting in carpet.

00:58.357 --> 01:03.094
What we have here
is a porcupine roller,
duckbill shears...

01:03.095 --> 01:05.096
What, are you laying carpet
at the zoo?

01:05.096 --> 01:08.099
Yes, I'm carpeting the zoo.

01:08.100 --> 01:11.536
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking of putting in
walrus-to-walrus carpeting.

01:19.545 --> 01:21.546
Well, all that
carpet humor aside,

01:21.547 --> 01:24.049
What we have here
is a porcupine roller used...

01:24.050 --> 01:28.352
These tools are fine
if you're laying a piece
in the hallway or den,

01:28.353 --> 01:30.454
But what if we want
to carpet a larger area?

01:30.455 --> 01:32.123
And that would be?

01:32.124 --> 01:34.192
The silverdome. Yeah.

01:34.193 --> 01:36.194
How long do you think
it would take

01:36.195 --> 01:38.563
To lay astroturf
using these wimpy tools?

01:38.564 --> 01:40.999
You wouldn't get past
the 10-yard line.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.233
Porcupine roller.

01:42.234 --> 01:44.335
This wouldn't do diddly
for a large area.

01:44.336 --> 01:47.739
What we need
is a "more power" porcupine.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.541
Heidi, my "more power"
porcupine, please.

01:53.813 --> 01:56.081
Oh! Ohh.

01:56.082 --> 01:57.949
Here you go, tim.

01:57.950 --> 02:00.318
Thank you, heidi.
You're welcome.

02:00.319 --> 02:05.556
There is no such thing
as a gas-powered porcupine!

02:05.557 --> 02:07.926
It all depends
on what it had to eat.

02:10.562 --> 02:15.166
<i>(engine starts)</i>

02:15.167 --> 02:19.237
Watch how beautifully
this seams our lovely
wheat-colored berber.

02:32.918 --> 02:34.819
Well, way to go, tim.

02:34.820 --> 02:37.388
And what would you
call that?

02:40.525 --> 02:42.560
Shredded wheat berber.

03:40.519 --> 03:43.354
I don't think we should be
steaming open the letter.

03:43.355 --> 03:46.024
My teacher said
to give it to mom and dad.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.026
We're doing this
for you, dork.

03:48.027 --> 03:50.528
Yeah. If you don't know
what the teacher said,

03:50.529 --> 03:53.331
Then you don't know
what lie to tell
to mom and dad.

03:53.332 --> 03:56.167
I don't have to lie.
I didn't do anything.

03:56.168 --> 03:59.037
Right, mark. Teachers always
send home notes like that.

03:59.038 --> 04:01.706
"dear mr. And mrs. Taylor,
mark didn't do anything.

04:01.707 --> 04:04.442
Just wanted
to try out the new pen."

04:06.378 --> 04:08.880
Hey, guys, how many times
have we told you

04:08.881 --> 04:10.715
About steaming open
letters?

04:10.716 --> 04:13.218
If you're gonna do it,
use the teapot here.

04:13.219 --> 04:15.386
Much more steam comes
out of this thing right here.

04:15.387 --> 04:17.521
That's good, tim.

04:17.522 --> 04:20.423
Why don't you teach 'em
next time how to pick a lock?

04:20.425 --> 04:23.027
You think
they're ready?

04:23.028 --> 04:25.029
Let me guess -
a note from school.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.265
Which one of you
is it this time?

04:27.266 --> 04:28.867
Not me.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.269
Not me.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.703
It's me.

04:32.704 --> 04:35.240
<i>(both)</i> you?

04:35.241 --> 04:38.176
Your first letter
from a teacher. All right.

04:38.177 --> 04:39.777
You're a man.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.782
You're in big trouble,
but you're a man.

04:44.783 --> 04:48.452
Mark, what's going on?
Nothing.

04:48.453 --> 04:50.688
Then why does your teacher
want to meet with us?

04:50.689 --> 04:53.091
I don't know.
I didn't do anything.

04:53.092 --> 04:56.127
Mark... I use that line
on your mom all the time.

04:56.128 --> 04:58.062
It hardly ever works.

04:58.063 --> 05:00.031
It never works.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.501
Tell us what's going on.

05:03.502 --> 05:06.771
Nothing. It's nothing.

05:08.173 --> 05:10.174
So what do you think
the problem is?

05:10.175 --> 05:13.177
He does well in school.
Maybe the teacher
doesn't like him.

05:13.178 --> 05:16.180
How could she not like him?
Mark is adorable.
Oh, come on.

05:16.181 --> 05:19.017
In fourth grade I was adorable.
My teacher hated me.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.352
Fifth grade teacher
didn't like me, either.

05:21.353 --> 05:23.888
Sixth grade teacher
had something out for me.

05:23.889 --> 05:26.257
Seventh grade was a nightmare.

05:26.258 --> 05:28.326
Tim, are you noticing
a pattern here?

05:28.327 --> 05:32.397
I had a string
of bad teachers.

05:32.398 --> 05:35.400
Where's the electric
can opener?
Tim.

05:35.401 --> 05:38.469
Oh, yes. 17 horse, whoa!

05:39.939 --> 05:41.940
We never did
find that thing, did we?

05:41.941 --> 05:44.775
I guess we're gonna find out
what's going on with mark

05:44.776 --> 05:46.811
When we meet the teacher
tomorrow.

05:46.812 --> 05:48.479
What time is that?
3:00.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.981
I can't do 3:00.

05:49.982 --> 05:52.383
I got <i>tool time</i> till 3:30.
Push it back to 4:15.

05:52.384 --> 05:55.086
No, can't do that.
I got a class at 4:30.

05:55.087 --> 05:58.089
Can you leave there at 3:15
and make it there by 3:30?

05:58.090 --> 06:01.192
No, not if I'm taking randy
to football practice at 3:45.

06:01.193 --> 06:03.461
Brad's got saxophone at four.

06:03.462 --> 06:05.997
And isn't mark's
distemper shot tomorrow?

06:07.032 --> 06:08.833
Flu shot.
Whatever.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.801
I forgot about that.

06:10.802 --> 06:13.438
Ok, ok, ok.
How about this?

06:13.439 --> 06:16.441
I will meet
with mark's teacher at 3:00
and find out what's going on.

06:16.442 --> 06:19.444
Since I'll be near the house,
I'll pick up brad and randy,

06:19.445 --> 06:21.645
Drop randy off
at football practice at 3:45,

06:21.646 --> 06:25.083
Brad at the saxophone lesson
at 4:15 on the way
to my 4:30 class.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.085
You take mark to the doctor
at 4:00.

06:27.086 --> 06:29.720
Oh, and make sure
that she checks that right ear.

06:29.721 --> 06:32.556
I think he's got
that waxy buildup thing
happening again.

06:32.557 --> 06:34.558
He might have to
have it irrigated.

06:34.559 --> 06:37.061
After the doctor, double back
to the football field,

06:37.062 --> 06:39.397
Pick up randy,
come home, make dinner.

06:39.398 --> 06:41.399
These should be ready
about 5:00.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.401
I'll pick up brad
on my way home.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.703
We should get there by six.
Does that sound good?

06:45.704 --> 06:46.904
Yeah.

06:48.673 --> 06:51.242
One more time
from the top.
Oh!

06:52.711 --> 06:57.548
Linoleum was invented in 1860

06:57.549 --> 07:00.684
By frederick walton
of England.

07:00.685 --> 07:02.820
Now, he discovered
that linseed oil,

07:02.821 --> 07:04.955
When left out
in the open air,

07:04.956 --> 07:07.791
Became kind of
a rubbery-like substance,

07:07.792 --> 07:13.631
Very suitable
for floor coverings.

07:13.632 --> 07:18.002
Now, because linseed oil
is from the flax plant,

07:18.003 --> 07:24.942
Mr. Walton decided
to call his product "linoleum"

07:24.943 --> 07:31.182
From the latin words <i>linum</i>
for "flax" and <i>oleum</i> for "oil."

07:31.183 --> 07:35.319
He also went on to invent
a straight-line inlay machine,

07:35.320 --> 07:39.257
So he was able
to produce his linoleum
in various patterns.

07:39.258 --> 07:41.459
Well!

07:41.460 --> 07:44.429
That's all for our history
on linoleum,

07:44.430 --> 07:47.731
Unless you'd have something
you'd like to add... Tim?

07:52.271 --> 07:55.839
All right.
Well, please join us tomorrow

07:55.840 --> 07:59.710
When we're back here with
the much-anticipated climax

07:59.711 --> 08:01.712
"floor coverings
of the future"

08:01.713 --> 08:04.648
Or "the vinyl frontier."

08:04.649 --> 08:08.186
<i>(theme music, applause)</i>

08:15.260 --> 08:18.496
Wake up, wake up,
wake up.
I'm awake, I'm awake.

08:18.497 --> 08:20.965
Great show, al.
Really learned a lot.

08:20.966 --> 08:24.969
Thank you. At least someone
appreciates the work I put
into this linoleum show.

08:24.970 --> 08:27.171
I really do.

08:27.172 --> 08:29.307
Well, what was
your favorite part?

08:29.308 --> 08:32.775
Yes, miss keppert,
what was your favorite part?

08:32.777 --> 08:35.846
Well, I found every part
equally fascinating.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.182
<i>(scoffs)</i>
really?

08:38.183 --> 08:40.351
Why don't we go
have some lunch?

08:40.352 --> 08:43.321
I'll fill you in
on my lecture tomorrow
on vinyl.

08:43.322 --> 08:46.357
Oh, ok.
Which is latin
for "snooze."

08:48.093 --> 08:50.828
Mark, we're leaving for
the doctor in five minutes.
Hurry up.

08:50.829 --> 08:54.064
Dad, don't forget to pick me up
right after football practice.

08:54.065 --> 08:56.734
Beth's coming over to study.
I need time to shower.

08:56.735 --> 08:59.437
You don't need to bother
with a shower. Do what I do.

08:59.438 --> 09:02.806
It fools your mom,
drives her wild.
Cool. What is it?

09:02.807 --> 09:06.844
Wear an auto freshener
around your neck.

09:06.845 --> 09:08.846
Pine scent.
Rugged outdoorsy stuff.

09:08.847 --> 09:10.348
Women love it.

09:10.349 --> 09:13.184
Well, if it doesn't
get me girls,

09:13.185 --> 09:16.120
It'll definitely
get me squirrels.

09:16.121 --> 09:18.889
Mark!
Would you go get him?

09:18.890 --> 09:20.658
Hi!
Hi.

09:20.659 --> 09:23.594
Brad, where are you?! You got
your saxophone lesson.
Randy, come on.

09:23.595 --> 09:26.096
How'd the meeting
with mark's teacher go?

09:26.097 --> 09:29.099
She was very nice
and very concerned
about mark.

09:29.100 --> 09:33.404
She said lately he's been
inattentive and withdrawn.

09:33.405 --> 09:36.574
That's better than
loud and obnoxious
like I was.

09:36.575 --> 09:40.511
I don't get it.
He's always loved school.
Brad! Randy!

09:40.512 --> 09:42.980
Mark! What does she
think the problem is?

09:42.981 --> 09:44.682
Well, she doesn't know.

09:44.683 --> 09:47.451
She asked me if there was
anything unusual going on
at home.

09:47.452 --> 09:49.987
Do you think he's upset
about me going to school?

09:49.988 --> 09:52.990
Maybe he feels abandoned.
You didn't abandon him.

09:52.991 --> 09:54.992
I'm not as available
as I used to be.

09:54.993 --> 09:58.696
I have all these late classes.
Library, studying...

09:58.697 --> 10:00.698
No, no, no, no.
I don't think that's it.

10:00.699 --> 10:03.834
Mark likes you
out of the house.
We all do.

10:03.835 --> 10:06.604
What I mean
is that we're very happy

10:06.605 --> 10:09.207
That you're pursuing
your dream. Mark!

10:09.208 --> 10:11.209
Brad, randy,
please hurry up!

10:11.210 --> 10:13.211
I'm gonna be late
for class.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.613
So you don't think
that I'm the problem?
No.

10:15.614 --> 10:17.682
Then it must be you.

10:17.683 --> 10:21.485
I am not the one
that abandoned my child.

10:21.486 --> 10:23.487
That's what you think,
isn't it?
No, it's not.

10:23.488 --> 10:25.489
I was afraid
this would happen.

10:25.490 --> 10:27.991
I knew I shouldn't
go back to class
until they were 30.

10:27.992 --> 10:30.695
Honey, honey, I was kidding.
It was a joke, ok?

10:30.696 --> 10:34.798
I'll talk to him
and I'll find out
what's the matter. Guys?

10:34.799 --> 10:36.634
Where's mark?

10:36.635 --> 10:39.704
Still trying to figure out
which sock goes on which foot.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.706
Come on. Hey - pine!

10:41.707 --> 10:45.109
You smell
just like your dad.
Beth's gonna love that.

10:50.682 --> 10:52.216
<i>(knock on door)</i>

10:52.217 --> 10:54.719
Come on, we're gonna be late
for the doctor.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.721
Dad, I don't want
to get a flu shot.

10:56.722 --> 10:58.389
The doctor's office is fun.

10:58.390 --> 11:00.458
While you're waiting,
you can play with the blocks.

11:00.459 --> 11:03.227
Dad, only babies
play with blocks.

11:03.228 --> 11:05.929
Don't you call me a baby.

11:05.930 --> 11:07.998
Come on.
Come on, come on!

11:07.999 --> 11:10.000
I'm trying
to get this knot out.

11:10.001 --> 11:12.670
Brad and randy
tied my shoes together.

11:12.671 --> 11:15.139
And a fine job they did.

11:15.140 --> 11:16.641
Oh, boy.

11:16.642 --> 11:19.310
You know, your mom talked
to your teacher today.

11:19.311 --> 11:22.413
Your teacher says you're
not paying attention
like you used to.

11:22.414 --> 11:24.882
I'm paying attention.

11:24.883 --> 11:27.418
Is the schoolwork
getting too hard for you?
No.

11:27.419 --> 11:29.387
Too easy?
No.

11:29.388 --> 11:32.222
Are you concerned about mom
going back to school?
No.

11:32.223 --> 11:34.392
Is that kid in front
bugging you again?
No.

11:34.393 --> 11:36.327
Kid behind you?
No.

11:36.328 --> 11:38.996
Are you worried
about male pattern baldness?

11:40.399 --> 11:43.768
Dad, will you stop asking me
a million questions?

11:43.769 --> 11:45.336
Nothing's going on.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.838
Stop, right now.
We are not leaving this house

11:47.839 --> 11:49.840
Till you tell me
what's going on.

11:49.841 --> 11:52.009
Great. Then I don't
have to get my flu shot.

11:52.010 --> 11:54.011
Wrong-o. You're not missing
the flu shot,

11:54.012 --> 11:56.514
And I'm not missing
the opportunity to play
with those blocks.

11:56.515 --> 11:58.516
Maybe the doctor
can find out what's wrong.

11:58.517 --> 12:01.218
He'll have to turn
your little head
and make you cough.

12:03.689 --> 12:08.292
Forget about it, brad.
You're not gonna get
your own phone.

12:08.293 --> 12:11.962
It's not for me. You see, mom,
I want this for you.

12:11.963 --> 12:14.699
Explain to me
how you getting a phone
benefits me.

12:14.700 --> 12:19.002
Well, you know how
I'm always tying up
the phone line?

12:19.003 --> 12:21.439
Then you get upset
and yell at me,

12:21.440 --> 12:23.541
And then you feel bad
about it?

12:23.542 --> 12:25.576
Well, if I had my own phone,

12:25.577 --> 12:28.479
You wouldn't suffer
like that.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.514
I'm touched
by your thoughtfulness, brad,

12:30.515 --> 12:33.083
But, actually,
I don't mind yelling at you.

12:33.084 --> 12:36.520
I find it's a good release
for me.

12:36.521 --> 12:40.290
Oh, hi, hi.
How did it go at the doctor's?

12:40.291 --> 12:42.593
It was a real drag.

12:42.594 --> 12:46.063
Bunch of four-year-olds
were hogging all the blocks.

12:48.099 --> 12:51.235
I mean with mark.
Did he get his flu shot?

12:51.236 --> 12:54.905
Was I right? Was it the ear?
Did he have that waxy buildup
stuff in it?

12:54.906 --> 12:58.242
No wax. Actually, a small bird
had made a nest in there.

12:58.243 --> 13:00.978
Did you ask him about
what's bothering him?

13:00.979 --> 13:04.582
Yes. What's bothering him
is people asking him
what's bothering him.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.585
That's all you got?
Did you ask him about me
going back to school?

13:07.586 --> 13:09.420
He's all right with that.

13:09.421 --> 13:12.490
I asked him a million things.
I got no answers.
Well, how did you ask him?

13:12.491 --> 13:15.493
Were you sensitive?
Did you make him
feel comfortable?

13:15.494 --> 13:17.495
Oh, yes, he was
quite comfortable.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.997
I served hors d'oeuvres,
made him a perfect rob roy.

13:19.998 --> 13:22.500
Rubbed his neck a bit,
gave him a foot massage.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.167
Yes, he was
quite comfortable.

13:24.168 --> 13:27.137
I'm serious.
How you approach mark
makes a big difference.

13:27.138 --> 13:30.140
You can't joke around with him
like you can the other kids.

13:30.141 --> 13:32.643
I should have been the one
to talk to him.

13:32.644 --> 13:35.145
There's nothing
you could have said
that I didn't.

13:35.146 --> 13:37.782
There are certain things
that mothers are just better at.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.885
I'm good at talking to my boys.
I might be better than you.

13:40.886 --> 13:43.120
Oh, really?
Yeah.

13:43.121 --> 13:46.557
No matter what stupid thing
they've done, they know
I've done something stupider.

13:48.393 --> 13:51.261
Well, can't argue with that.

13:51.262 --> 13:54.565
What I'm trying to say is
there's a very special bond
between fathers and sons.

13:54.566 --> 13:57.134
There's a special bond
between mothers and son.

13:57.135 --> 13:59.937
It's a little thing
called the umbilical cord.

13:59.938 --> 14:02.940
Hello? He's nine.
He's cordless now.

14:04.175 --> 14:06.410
You know, and I
kind of resent the fact

14:06.411 --> 14:08.879
You think you're a better
parent than I am.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.549
I did not say that.
That's what
it sounded like to me.

14:11.550 --> 14:12.983
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

14:12.984 --> 14:15.986
I spend a lot more time
with my boys than most parents.

14:15.987 --> 14:20.324
I'm caring, I'm understanding,
and I'm responsible.

14:21.793 --> 14:24.294
Hi, beth.
Hi, mr. Taylor.
I'm here to see randy.

14:24.295 --> 14:27.865
Randy? Honey,
did you pick randy up
from football practice?

14:27.866 --> 14:32.670
No. His caring,
sensitive, responsible father
was supposed to do that.

14:34.238 --> 14:37.240
Oh, yeah. I'm on my way.

14:41.245 --> 14:43.447
I think tim and randy
will be back soon.

14:43.448 --> 14:45.516
I hope so.

14:47.953 --> 14:52.122
So, how's school?
Ok.

14:54.693 --> 14:57.528
Did randy tell you
that I'm going back to school?

14:57.529 --> 15:00.965
Oh, yeah. And we both think
it's really weird.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.302
Well, aren't you
an honest little thing?

15:07.238 --> 15:09.640
Maybe you'd feel
more comfortable

15:09.641 --> 15:12.643
Waiting for randy in his room
till we call you for dinner.

15:12.644 --> 15:16.046
All right, thanks.
Good. Ok.

15:17.348 --> 15:19.917
Oh, mark, hi.
How are you doing?

15:19.918 --> 15:21.051
Fine.

15:21.052 --> 15:24.121
Um, I have some cookies.
Would you like some?

15:24.122 --> 15:25.823
Ok.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.625
I feel really bad.

15:27.626 --> 15:31.061
I've been so busy lately,
we haven't been able
to have our customary chats.

15:31.062 --> 15:33.030
How you doing?
Fine.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.634
Um, I talked to your teacher,

15:36.635 --> 15:39.269
And she's kinda concerned
about you.

15:39.270 --> 15:43.741
She thinks that maybe
you're having a hard time
with something.

15:43.742 --> 15:45.876
I'm not.
Dad already asked me.

15:45.877 --> 15:47.878
Yeah, I know.
I just thought

15:47.879 --> 15:50.480
That you might feel
more comfortable
talking to me.

15:50.481 --> 15:52.049
Nope.

15:52.050 --> 15:54.484
Oh, come on, honey.

15:54.485 --> 15:58.088
You know
that you always feel better
when you tell me what's wrong.

15:58.089 --> 15:59.456
Nothing's wrong.

15:59.457 --> 16:03.027
Man, you're worse
than dad.

16:03.028 --> 16:06.430
Do the words "umbilical cord"
mean anything to you?

16:15.607 --> 16:17.841
Hey, brad?
Yeah?

16:17.842 --> 16:20.343
Can I ask you
something?
What?

16:20.344 --> 16:23.914
How do you get moved
from the back of the class
to the front of the class?

16:23.915 --> 16:26.050
Why would you want
to go to the front?

16:26.051 --> 16:29.053
I don't know if you've noticed,
but that's where the teacher is.

16:31.022 --> 16:33.156
I need to sit in the front.

16:33.157 --> 16:36.526
Aw, shoot!

16:36.527 --> 16:38.328
Why?

16:38.329 --> 16:41.899
Promise not
to tell mom and dad?
Promise.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.469
I can't see the board
from the back.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.638
So? What's the big deal?

16:50.441 --> 16:53.744
I'll have to get glasses.

16:53.745 --> 16:56.013
Hi-de-ho, taylor lads.

16:56.014 --> 16:58.048
Brad, I believe
this is yours.

16:58.049 --> 16:59.750
Oh, thanks, wilson.

16:59.751 --> 17:02.686
Wilson, did you hear
what we were saying?

17:02.687 --> 17:06.790
Just the part
about not seeing the board
and needing glasses.

17:06.790 --> 17:09.559
You're not gonna
tell my parents, are you?

17:09.560 --> 17:13.063
Mark, that isn't my place.
But I hope that you will.

17:13.064 --> 17:17.367
I can't.
They'll make me get glasses,
and I'll look like a dork.

17:17.367 --> 17:21.371
Mark, might I remind you
that benjamin franklin,

17:21.372 --> 17:23.941
Sigmund freud, mahatma gandhi
all wore glasses,

17:23.942 --> 17:26.409
And I don't think that anyone
would consider them dorks.

17:26.410 --> 17:29.246
I would.

17:30.982 --> 17:34.018
I don't want
to look like a dork.

17:34.019 --> 17:36.453
Well, then may I suggest
an alternative solution

17:36.454 --> 17:39.089
That will help improve
your eyesight?

17:39.090 --> 17:41.191
Here's a handy little trick
I picked up

17:41.192 --> 17:44.995
From a russian ophthalmologist
I met at a caviar-tasting
festival.

17:44.996 --> 17:46.997
Take a piece of paper

17:46.998 --> 17:50.901
And you make a tiny,
tiny, tiny, little hole,

17:50.902 --> 17:53.303
Then you hold it
up to your eye,

17:53.304 --> 17:57.174
And it will correct your myopia
by allowing the eye
to refocus light

17:57.175 --> 17:59.977
Upon a mosaic
of photosensitive receptors.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.779
What?

18:01.780 --> 18:05.582
It'll help you see better.

18:05.583 --> 18:08.485
Wow. It really works.
Uh-huh.

18:08.486 --> 18:11.388
And if you use two,

18:11.389 --> 18:14.324
It's twice as effective.

18:14.325 --> 18:15.693
This is great.

18:15.694 --> 18:19.362
I'll never
have to wear glasses

18:19.363 --> 18:22.700
And I won't look like a dork.

18:22.701 --> 18:26.770
Mark, mark, buddy.
Just tell me one thing.

18:26.771 --> 18:29.406
What do I look like?

18:31.743 --> 18:33.711
A dork.

18:39.584 --> 18:41.685
Mom?

18:41.686 --> 18:44.188
Oh, honey,
I've been thinking.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.489
I shouldn't be
putting pressure on you.

18:46.490 --> 18:49.326
If you want to talk,
I'm always here to listen,

18:49.327 --> 18:51.995
But if you don't,
I'm fine with that, too.

18:51.996 --> 18:53.496
I want to talk.

18:53.497 --> 18:55.599
Good. Sit down.
Pour your little heart out.

18:59.270 --> 19:02.339
I can't see the board
at school.

19:02.340 --> 19:05.475
I think I need glasses.

19:05.476 --> 19:08.712
Is that what's bothering you?
That's not so bad.

19:08.713 --> 19:10.313
It's bad to me.

19:10.314 --> 19:13.583
Honey, lots of kids
wear glasses.

19:13.584 --> 19:15.385
You don't understand.

19:15.386 --> 19:17.988
Some of the kids
already think I'm a dork.

19:17.989 --> 19:20.390
If I get glasses,
all of them will.

19:20.391 --> 19:22.392
Nobody thinks you're a dork.

19:22.393 --> 19:24.862
Then why do they
call me "dork"?

19:29.600 --> 19:33.403
Well, because some kids
are just mean.

19:33.404 --> 19:36.539
They think by calling you names
that makes them cool.

19:36.540 --> 19:38.842
Let me tell you
what real cool is.

19:38.843 --> 19:42.545
Real cool is feeling good
about yourself

19:42.546 --> 19:46.316
And not worrying
about what other people think.

19:46.317 --> 19:47.885
What do you mean?

19:47.886 --> 19:51.454
Well, let's use your father
as an example.

19:53.357 --> 19:55.358
Your father does some things

19:55.359 --> 19:57.360
That some people
might consider dorky,

19:57.361 --> 19:59.863
Like the time
that he froze his tongue

19:59.864 --> 20:01.364
To the hammer

20:01.365 --> 20:03.700
Or the time
that he glued his head

20:03.701 --> 20:05.368
To the table.

20:05.369 --> 20:08.939
But it doesn't bother him.

20:08.940 --> 20:11.208
You know why?
Why?

20:11.209 --> 20:13.977
Because he feels good
about who he is,

20:13.978 --> 20:16.646
And you should feel good
about who you are.

20:16.647 --> 20:17.881
I should?

20:17.882 --> 20:19.883
Yeah. You are a great kid.

20:19.884 --> 20:23.020
You are so smart
and you're fun to be with

20:23.021 --> 20:25.588
And you care about
other people, right?

20:25.589 --> 20:27.590
Right.

20:27.591 --> 20:30.760
Look, tomorrow, we'll go down
and we'll get your eyes checked,

20:30.761 --> 20:32.762
And if you need glasses,

20:32.763 --> 20:36.666
We'll just make sure
that you get some
really cool frames.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.903
Do you think I'd look good
in aviator glasses?

20:39.904 --> 20:42.639
Oh, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.875
I'd fly anywhere with you.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.710
Thanks, mom.

20:46.711 --> 20:50.948
Honey,
it makes me feel so good

20:50.949 --> 20:54.218
That we still have
our special bond,

20:54.219 --> 20:56.720
You know, that you feel
comfortable coming to me

20:56.721 --> 20:58.722
When you need to talk.

20:58.723 --> 21:01.258
Well, you were
the only one home.

21:06.530 --> 21:08.866
Guys, they just
pulled up front.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.368
When mark comes in
with the glasses,
no comments.

21:11.369 --> 21:13.670
No "four-eyes,"
no "goggle-face," nothing.

21:13.671 --> 21:18.475
Oh, "goggle-face."
I've never heard
of that one.

21:18.476 --> 21:21.211
And you call yourself
a taylor.

21:21.212 --> 21:22.946
Hi.
Hi.

21:22.947 --> 21:24.114
Hey, mark.

21:24.115 --> 21:26.383
Well, how'd it go
at the optometrist?

21:26.384 --> 21:29.319
Oh, it was fine.
His eyes aren't that bad.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.822
The doctor said
that all he needs them for
is seeing the blackboard,

21:32.823 --> 21:36.093
Watching movies and driving.

21:36.094 --> 21:37.594
Let's see 'em.

21:40.865 --> 21:42.866
Aah!

21:44.068 --> 21:46.770
They look good.
Yeah,
they're pretty cool.

21:46.771 --> 21:48.972
Yeah,
they're really nice.
Thanks.

21:48.973 --> 21:50.974
And if anybody
calls you a dork,

21:50.975 --> 21:53.043
They're gonna have to answer
to us, all right?

21:53.044 --> 21:54.644
That's right.

21:54.645 --> 21:57.647
We're the only ones
who are allowed
to call you a dork.

21:57.648 --> 21:59.649
I don't care
what they call me.

21:59.650 --> 22:02.819
Mom says dad's a dork
and he feels good about it.

22:11.029 --> 22:12.729
Ha.

22:14.565 --> 22:16.934
You called me a dork?

22:16.935 --> 22:21.004
<i>(whispers)</i> I was trying
to build up his self-esteem.

22:21.005 --> 22:23.941
<i>(whispers)</i>
what about my self-esteem?

22:27.878 --> 22:30.780
There's nothing
you could have said
that I didn't.

22:30.781 --> 22:34.251
Well, there are certain things
that mothers are just better at.

22:34.252 --> 22:37.287
I'm pretty dosh-garned good
at calking to my - to-to...

22:40.691 --> 22:43.593
We're gonna be late
for the doctor.

22:43.594 --> 22:46.096
I don't want
to get a flu shot.

22:46.097 --> 22:49.266
The doctor sh...
<i>(stutters)</i>
