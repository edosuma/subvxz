00:10.940 --> 00:13.320
They say that your devil is closer.

00:16.770 --> 00:19.390
If the devil knows you personally

00:20.260 --> 00:22.730
you are always threatened by darkness.

00:23.660 --> 00:25.660
She will swallow you.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.620
Everywhere you look,
there is only darkness all around.

00:33.430 --> 00:37.570
Do not escape from the devil. After
all, you can’t escape from yourself.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.210
Hey watch out!

00:47.660 --> 00:49.950
Where is mom? There she is! Hello!

00:50.030 --> 00:52.160
Hello! How nice of you to arrive.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.520
Well, how to skip this?
We are happy to be here.

00:55.010 --> 00:58.320
Mr. and Mrs. Morgan! How
are you? Happy Birthday!

00:58.400 --> 01:00.400
Happy Birthday! Go here.

01:00.610 --> 01:03.180
Hold on,
happy birthday. I hope you enjoy it.

01:03.510 --> 01:06.080
Just look! Wow!

01:06.830 --> 01:08.830
New York Yankees.

01:09.390 --> 01:11.410
Where is Hans? Watch it!

01:11.460 --> 01:16.620
Something is disturbing him. I haven’t slept
all night. She and Karl are now at the lake.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.850
Honey,
will you talk to him? Yes. Excuse me.

01:22.870 --> 01:24.900
How cute! Good to see you.

01:34.390 --> 01:37.070
Hans! Are you going on a holiday?

01:37.260 --> 01:39.260
Mr. Becker wants to be alone.

01:40.630 --> 01:43.110
If I miscalculated like that,
I would also hide from everyone.

01:43.390 --> 01:46.820
You invested billions
in high yield bonds

01:46.900 --> 01:48.960
and now they cost little.

01:53.550 --> 01:57.210
The bank is destroyed.
I will lose everything.

01:58.310 --> 02:01.090
Everything can be saved
if the earth grows in value...

02:02.700 --> 02:04.700
But this will not happen.

02:04.970 --> 02:06.970
You're in the ass.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.560
More precisely,
it would have been if not for NYL.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.640
I am ready to give you a helping
hand. And what kind of help is this?

02:15.910 --> 02:18.200
Liquid means to ride out the storm.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.430
Just out of kindness?

02:21.040 --> 02:23.040
Good question.

02:23.480 --> 02:26.970
In return, I will only ask for the
continuation of our friendship.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.480
As it was before.

02:33.150 --> 02:36.120
Let's go. Let's get back.

02:41.240 --> 02:49.050
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday, dear Jürgen,

02:49.320 --> 02:52.510
happy Birthday to You!

03:07.150 --> 03:11.630
Why are the current PIIGS
European countries so toxic?

03:12.220 --> 03:15.910
Their financial situation makes
us look like Goldman Sachs.

04:14.220 --> 04:17.610
I do not kill people. Just
like you kill, Massimo.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.420
Kill.

04:20.850 --> 04:22.850
Such as brother Sofia.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.770
Hey.

04:36.130 --> 04:38.270
So what did I miss?

04:38.400 --> 04:40.640
I looked over Ed's papers.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.320
Found anything? See for yourself.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.270
Surely millions of
dollars are hidden there.

04:48.020 --> 04:50.150
Not millions, but billions.

04:50.230 --> 04:53.610
This fund costs as much as 52 billion.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.110
Sufficient motive for killing.

04:56.330 --> 05:00.200
Perhaps, but these are
just ordinary synthetic CDOs.

05:00.450 --> 05:02.560
A bond secured by debt obligations.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.640
Hard to explain...

05:05.340 --> 05:07.340
I know what CDO is,

05:07.420 --> 05:11.140
and also know perfectly well
that shit is being covered with it.

05:12.070 --> 05:14.070
Really? Yeah.

05:14.730 --> 05:16.730
I beg.

05:18.830 --> 05:22.020
Okay. Well, imagine...

05:23.920 --> 05:27.330
Imagine that you have
products that will soon go bad -

05:27.450 --> 05:29.480
flour or eggs. Yeah.

05:29.670 --> 05:34.160
But you do not want to throw them away.
And what are you doing? Baking a cake.

05:35.110 --> 05:38.350
You mix it all together.
But you are not a fool.

05:39.010 --> 05:43.810
You decorate the cake with
bright sprinkles and cute curls -

05:43.890 --> 05:46.280
top rated bonds -

05:46.360 --> 05:48.480
to make the cake
look beautiful and tasty.

05:49.180 --> 05:51.180
Right?

05:51.260 --> 05:54.510
But the catch is that
when you cut the cake,

05:54.590 --> 05:57.680
you find toxic assets.

05:58.520 --> 06:01.660
For example, as in two thousand eight.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.240
Low quality mortgage.

06:06.390 --> 06:08.390
Not bad. Fine!

06:09.320 --> 06:13.840
However, this cake is not
toxic. Take a look at the income.

06:14.940 --> 06:17.790
Not a single delay in payment,
nor default.

06:18.020 --> 06:22.890
Reintaler Bank pays
us 250 million per month.

06:24.420 --> 06:28.440
If Ed Stuart had concocted this,
he could have been proud.

06:28.730 --> 06:30.730
So why did he hide it?

06:30.810 --> 06:34.290
I dont know. But Dominic knows.

06:38.220 --> 06:42.110
You were right. These are
synthetic CDOs. Two billion.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.280
Through Reintaler
Bank? It seems like that.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.360
Ned, please.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.220
Ahhh. Massimo

06:49.910 --> 06:53.590
Does he still trust you?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.710
Yes. I think yes.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.376
The debt crisis that has gripped
the small economies of Europe,

07:05.400 --> 07:07.400
now threatens the rest.

07:07.530 --> 07:10.290
All major European economies
dominated by markets

07:10.440 --> 07:12.440
and need salvation...

07:35.510 --> 07:38.110
Jeremy, do you want a drink?
Yes. Please close the door.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.680
Have you heard that the US government
debt rating they want to lower...

07:43.060 --> 07:45.070
I got a call from Margaret Cunningham.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.160
And what will you do with it, Dominic?

07:48.050 --> 07:50.050
This is your plan.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.740
And I follow him,
as agreed with the council.

07:57.620 --> 08:02.430
That is, no problem, you want to say?

08:03.390 --> 08:05.390
You care about my strategy...

08:05.670 --> 08:09.470
I guess pigs in the press
can amuse someone,

08:09.750 --> 08:12.180
but I would not call it a strategy.

08:12.940 --> 08:15.570
What should I do to calm you down?

08:16.040 --> 08:18.450
Maybe start with the
story of Hans Becker?

08:18.870 --> 08:20.960
He is with us. I heard something else.

08:21.450 --> 08:23.716
We have an agreement, and he
will fulfill it when the time comes.

08:23.740 --> 08:26.130
You said the same thing about Stuart.

08:26.890 --> 08:29.096
By the way, how is the
investigation going on in his case?

08:29.120 --> 08:32.860
Closed. Suicide. And
the deal with the end.

08:32.940 --> 08:36.280
With the end, you say?
- Yeah. Many cases are reopened.

08:37.860 --> 08:41.150
You know, I still can’t understand,
something in my head does not fit.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.230
Yeah.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.400
Why are you so persistently
defending Massimo Ruggiero.

08:48.460 --> 08:51.360
You know, he is our best
trader. He sets the trends.

08:52.620 --> 08:54.830
Yesterday he shorted Spanish banks

08:54.920 --> 08:56.960
and earned more than
two hundred million.

08:57.430 --> 09:00.010
He is unpredictable. He is smart.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.410
He is a naughty child who needs
to be put in a corner sometimes.

09:07.970 --> 09:09.970
You are the global CEO.

09:10.860 --> 09:13.570
I hope when the time comes,
you will judge me by the results,

09:13.650 --> 09:15.650
not out of my fears.

10:34.780 --> 10:37.170
Massimo What time is it now?

10:37.260 --> 10:40.370
Waiting for you, Eleanor and Oliver
in the freezer. At seven thirty.

10:58.490 --> 11:01.880
Is everything okay? Yes,
I'm late. Tyrone overslept.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.960
Again? Yeah.

11:04.660 --> 11:08.740
Didn't forget that you're taking him to
school? I have a duty on the hospital.

11:08.820 --> 11:12.720
Oh yes. Listen, Toy, could you?

11:12.800 --> 11:14.880
Don't even dare to ask for it.

11:20.020 --> 11:22.920
Tai! Get up, we have to go.

11:23.340 --> 11:25.340
Come in.

11:25.660 --> 11:27.660
What are you doing? AND? What is it?

11:29.620 --> 11:32.690
Stupid form. Friends
are laughing at me.

11:32.790 --> 11:35.200
So they're not your friends, okay?

11:35.750 --> 11:38.000
This school is much better, right?

11:39.380 --> 11:41.380
Put on your shoes.

11:43.650 --> 11:45.650
Do not!

11:48.940 --> 11:51.120
What the hell is this?
Put it on it's place!

11:54.510 --> 11:56.570
Why do you need this? That's not mine.

11:56.650 --> 11:59.000
Then whose? My friend.

11:59.740 --> 12:03.190
He did not want to be caught.
What's a friend? Look into the eyes!

12:09.550 --> 12:11.630
Do you know what they
could do with this thing? AND?

12:18.540 --> 12:21.730
You think I don’t understand?
You think this wasn’t with me?

12:23.280 --> 12:26.670
You are above it! Come on.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.600
What happened?

12:43.560 --> 12:47.720
We need to get out
of here. At any cost.

12:57.970 --> 13:01.160
So. Documents cannot
be taken out of here. Clear?

13:02.310 --> 13:04.630
They were found among the
things of Ed, after his death.

13:04.870 --> 13:07.030
Where are you from? Better not ask.

13:13.620 --> 13:16.520
It looks like accounting,
synthetic CDO.

13:16.850 --> 13:19.800
Fifty-two billion, and my signature.

13:19.990 --> 13:21.990
And what is wrong?

13:22.070 --> 13:24.490
Everything is so,
only I did not sign it.

13:25.610 --> 13:27.710
Has someone faked
your digital signature?

13:28.430 --> 13:30.770
Apparently, yes. Are assets illiquid?

13:30.930 --> 13:34.620
At first glance, no. They are secured,
but I looked further

13:34.780 --> 13:37.270
back to the first payout
date in October 2009.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.120
Before the dividend
payment of 250 million.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.770
And what happens... NYL
also does the translation.

13:45.230 --> 13:47.920
At the rate of? Two
hundred and fifty million.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.930
Every month. On the same day!

13:51.010 --> 13:53.360
The same amount. Every damn month.

13:53.590 --> 13:56.830
NYL drives money back and forth,
but no one gets anything.

13:56.910 --> 13:58.940
This may not be a coincidence.

13:59.020 --> 14:01.830
Find out where the money
comes from and to whom it goes.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.810
Do you think this has to do
with the murder of Ed Stewart?

14:20.760 --> 14:23.330
You haven't said a
word since you woke up.

14:25.510 --> 14:27.710
Jeremy Stonehouse
came to me yesterday.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.460
Worried about Hans.

14:32.750 --> 14:35.570
And you too? He also
worries about Massimo.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.220
He believes that you should
have got rid of him a long time ago.

14:47.730 --> 14:49.730
Now I keep him in a cage.

14:49.820 --> 14:52.620
But people like Massimo
will find a way to get out.

14:52.700 --> 14:55.010
Anyway. And then what?

14:55.760 --> 14:57.760
I will do what I must.

15:12.940 --> 15:14.940
Now the problem is

15:15.020 --> 15:17.420
what if you are one
of the PIIGS countries

15:17.500 --> 15:20.160
you cannot take
loans for any interest,

15:20.240 --> 15:23.760
because you are no longer a
welcome member of the borrower club!

15:34.240 --> 15:37.470
Where is Oliver? I do
not know. I wrote to him.

15:37.550 --> 15:40.240
But he still did not come.
What are you hinting at?

15:40.640 --> 15:42.910
Yesterday,
he licked Paul's ass all night.

15:42.990 --> 15:45.210
We saw them drinking at the club.

15:49.910 --> 15:52.180
May it remain between us.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.000
Sorry, I had to take Tyrone to
a new school. What did I miss?

16:07.080 --> 16:09.200
Instructions for Greece. Nothing.

16:26.910 --> 16:29.730
Massimo, if not for you,
I would not be here.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.700
I will not forget that.

16:32.970 --> 16:34.970
Many thanks.

17:04.369 --> 17:07.300
How long has he been following
me? How did you get out of him.

17:07.430 --> 17:10.950
Oh god Could say before I sat down.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.270
Itself could notice.
You become careless.

17:14.349 --> 17:16.369
But I brought Massimo to us!

17:16.450 --> 17:18.810
Massimo is not with us,
he thinks only of himself.

17:19.550 --> 17:21.940
So are you. Sorry, what?

17:22.589 --> 17:24.980
You and I are on the same side! Right?

17:28.490 --> 17:32.360
Yes. I'm just a little tired.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.450
You are so close.

17:35.630 --> 17:39.240
You think these CDOs... killed
Ed Stewart because of them?

17:39.960 --> 17:42.240
Follow Massimo like a shadow.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.840
Let him know everything for us.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.930
You can do it...

17:48.380 --> 17:50.460
focus on business again?

17:53.160 --> 17:55.160
Your mother!

18:14.760 --> 18:17.810
You cannot hide forever. We
will have to give him an answer.

18:21.090 --> 18:23.090
I need time to think.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.360
Yes? Mr. Morgan

18:33.440 --> 18:36.000
I called Mr. Becker to personal
numbers, but he does not answer.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.200
Call on.

18:42.710 --> 18:44.720
Come in. Hey.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.800
Close the door.

18:47.370 --> 18:49.550
Well done with Spanish banks.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.770
Thank. There is work for you.

18:52.070 --> 18:54.960
I want you to start
shorting Reintaler Bank.

18:58.210 --> 19:01.120
They are our partners.
Why go against them?

19:01.360 --> 19:03.550
Their position is unstable.

19:03.930 --> 19:06.520
And this is our task as
a partner - to support.

19:06.690 --> 19:08.690
Not this time.

19:10.510 --> 19:13.230
Assign this to the new head
of the trading department.

19:15.940 --> 19:17.940
He is not you.

19:19.110 --> 19:21.310
You want to destroy the Germans.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.670
Nina has come. Do you
want to have lunch with us?

19:31.500 --> 19:34.400
I better get started.
Keep me informed.

19:52.140 --> 19:54.140
What did you find?

19:54.220 --> 19:56.220
According to the scheme, every month

19:56.300 --> 19:58.830
$ 250 million is withdrawn
from various offshore accounts.

19:58.910 --> 20:01.030
From accounts that cannot be tracked.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.190
Luckily they are registered

20:03.270 --> 20:05.270
the same law firm.

20:05.350 --> 20:08.800
All of them ultimately lead
through Cyprus to the Virgin Islands.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.620
Do you recognize the
name? Campbell Rodriguez.

20:13.870 --> 20:17.320
And we work through them. We
contacted their accounting department,

20:17.510 --> 20:20.110
and there they confirmed
the final recipient of the money.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.730
Guess who? Reintaler Bank?

20:22.810 --> 20:25.670
They launder money and
send it back to themselves.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.190
Money goes in circles,
but no one made money on it.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.080
Strange affair. Dominic
ordered them to be shorted.

20:32.450 --> 20:35.130
But they are our
partners! I told him so.

20:35.840 --> 20:39.270
Months and years. Ed
couldn’t lead everything alone.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.920
Top management in London and
Germany should be in the know.

20:43.070 --> 20:45.070
And Dominic knows all about it.

20:45.260 --> 20:48.730
Such a deal should have
significant physical support.

20:49.020 --> 20:51.020
Destroy the paper. Already going.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.510
Try to find collateral assets.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.630
We already tried,
but we reached a dead end.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.220
Property or organization

20:58.300 --> 21:01.000
nor indicated as collateral,
they are perfectly hidden.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.740
I seem to know how to find them.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.240
Anti-capitalism is not a solution.

21:11.280 --> 21:14.340
A market economy is the only solution.

21:15.530 --> 21:20.600
But we will save both capitalism and
the market economy by reforming them.

21:22.890 --> 21:26.430
I would even say -
returning ethics to them.

21:33.030 --> 21:35.030
Detective Bale.

21:35.110 --> 21:37.250
I hope I didn’t interfere,
Mrs. Stuart.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.560
Not at all.

21:40.770 --> 21:43.800
But I thought the
investigation was closed.

21:43.930 --> 21:47.000
We have new information.
You do not take me time?

21:50.160 --> 21:52.340
Hey! Cool shoes!

21:53.940 --> 21:55.940
Have you read the Financial
Times in the morning?

21:56.020 --> 21:58.600
Yes, I did. Someone leaked
your pig report to them.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.720
Not someone. You.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.800
Mr. Morgan is waiting for you.

22:04.430 --> 22:06.430
No no, not you. Only him.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.920
Yeah.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.510
About the Financial
Times in the morning...

22:33.600 --> 22:36.930
If we asked them to write about PIIGS,
they would not.

22:38.660 --> 22:43.520
But the report merged into the
Internet is a tidbit. Please sit down.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.600
Clear.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.080
Yesterday you proved your worth to us.

22:48.380 --> 22:50.580
I hope you continue this way.

22:51.570 --> 22:53.570
Thank you sir. I hope too.

22:55.310 --> 22:58.710
Thanks Massimo. Without
him you would not be here.

22:59.300 --> 23:01.300
And there is. I am grateful to him.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.520
He changed your life.

23:03.670 --> 23:05.670
This is true.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.220
He is a great boss.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.750
It was probably not easy to lower him.

23:13.970 --> 23:16.850
This is for his sake.
I hope not for long.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.600
So I need your help.

23:19.750 --> 23:22.740
How can I help? Be my eyes and ears.

23:26.330 --> 23:28.710
Are you asking me to spy? Not at all.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.230
But I'm too far from them,
I need to know

23:32.310 --> 23:34.800
what does the team of Massimo
do to save them from trouble.

23:37.230 --> 23:39.720
But, Mr. Morgan, I'm not a snitch.

23:39.890 --> 23:44.420
Of course! You protect
them. And I will protect you.

23:47.370 --> 23:49.370
Sir?

23:49.850 --> 23:52.270
I know that you threw a microcomputer.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.390
But I will take care of you.

23:55.690 --> 23:57.690
And you - about me.

23:58.250 --> 24:01.470
Now we are your family,
and family is most important.

24:08.550 --> 24:10.550
Hm.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.910
Have a nice day.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.800
Thank.

24:46.630 --> 24:48.630
How are you? AND?

24:49.520 --> 24:51.520
Come in.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.300
Why did the detective come?

24:55.380 --> 24:57.510
She said that new
circumstances arose in the case.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.600
Circumstances?

24:59.970 --> 25:02.120
That is all she said.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.230
I wanted to find out
about Ed's documents.

25:04.540 --> 25:07.590
What documents? Which I
have long given to the police.

25:09.450 --> 25:11.960
Nina! Nina! Hello!

25:12.040 --> 25:14.800
Come on! Come with us! Come on!

25:16.350 --> 25:18.430
Here are the collateral
assets you were looking for.

25:18.520 --> 25:20.650
Where did you find it? Better not ask.

25:23.900 --> 25:26.750
Does Duval know about this?
You asked him not to speak.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.120
I looked through.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.440
All these are quite
valuable assets for CDO.

25:35.760 --> 25:38.630
And this is the most
expensive. Here it is!

25:39.200 --> 25:41.370
Nuclear power plant in Novareni.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.240
Someone uses it as
collateral for money,

25:44.320 --> 25:46.870
that go through the
Reintaler Bank bonds.

25:46.950 --> 25:49.470
There is not a word about
who controls the station,

25:49.580 --> 25:52.540
or who owns it since
Moldova left the USSR.

25:53.140 --> 25:55.140
Yes, the documents were cleared.

25:55.840 --> 25:59.070
I want to see for myself.
I need to go to the airport.

25:59.150 --> 26:01.260
What for?

26:01.340 --> 26:03.770
Perhaps it was because
of this that Ed was killed.

26:04.380 --> 26:06.520
Okay, let's fly. I'd rather fly alone.

26:07.050 --> 26:09.216
If it weren’t for me, you would
not have known about it at all!

26:09.240 --> 26:11.430
And I thank you. But
this is too dangerous.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.520
Really? Yes.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.320
Massimo I'm leaving
for a couple of days.

26:25.930 --> 26:28.840
Cover me. Okay. Where are you going?

26:29.410 --> 26:32.020
To Moldova. Find me everything you can

26:32.100 --> 26:34.320
to the nuclear power
plant in Novareni.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.280
Good.

26:47.870 --> 26:49.870
What's happening?

26:49.950 --> 26:52.070
Today I took your
wife to Stuart's widow.

26:52.150 --> 26:54.270
I saw that woman from
the police. Vicki Bale

26:55.110 --> 26:57.110
She asked questions about CDO.

26:58.180 --> 27:00.990
Perhaps they already linked
the bonds to Stuart's death.

27:01.700 --> 27:03.700
And maybe not only them.

28:17.160 --> 28:20.120
If you think about what is happening,
you can come to a conclusion...

28:23.130 --> 28:26.650
Night flight to Moldova.
A place next to yours.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.760
What the hell are you here? Clear.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.950
I didn’t tell how my brother died?

28:31.030 --> 28:33.270
Yes,
Sofia... He died because of your bank.

28:35.910 --> 28:37.910
Last ten years

28:38.000 --> 28:40.490
I tried to find a way to
destroy the bastards to blame

28:40.570 --> 28:44.110
and no one - neither you nor
Duval - will bother me. So let's go.

28:57.610 --> 28:59.610
Hey. Hey.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.300
Fuh. Tough day?

29:04.380 --> 29:06.380
Yes, you could say that.

29:16.870 --> 29:20.150
Do not touch. Nope. Get up

29:20.900 --> 29:24.370
What? Get up Sit down.

29:28.390 --> 29:30.390
What are you doing?

29:31.300 --> 29:33.300
Care about you.

29:33.900 --> 29:36.360
Truth? Yeah. Close eyes.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
What? Well shut it.

29:41.130 --> 29:43.130
Okay.

29:45.380 --> 29:47.380
Nah!

29:47.980 --> 29:50.650
Do not touch. It is too early.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.320
Heck! This is Tyrone. Oliver!

30:00.770 --> 30:04.380
You have a day to return the gun to
me, do not care where you get it from!

30:04.500 --> 30:07.270
Hey! You understood me?

30:07.380 --> 30:11.590
Do you understand? If I do not understand,
I can explain it again! Mudila!

30:19.070 --> 30:24.020
Hey! Heck. What happened here?

30:24.100 --> 30:26.266
Nothing! Everything is fine!
Please take him to the hospital.

30:26.290 --> 30:28.400
No! No! No hospital or police.

30:28.480 --> 30:32.400
He doesn't need drives,
okay? Can you wash the wound?

30:33.590 --> 30:35.590
I'll try. Fine.

30:36.080 --> 30:39.490
Come on into the house,
let's go. Was that your friend?

30:39.570 --> 30:41.610
It's all your fault! It's my fault?

30:41.690 --> 30:43.690
He freaked out when I
said I don’t have a gun!

30:44.370 --> 30:46.370
What?!

31:06.470 --> 31:08.470
Well?

31:08.550 --> 31:10.710
The Ministry does not know
either English or French,

31:10.800 --> 31:12.840
neither Italian nor Spanish.

31:13.460 --> 31:15.890
I had to go to me. I speak Russian.

31:15.970 --> 31:17.970
You would not be told anything anyway.

31:18.430 --> 31:20.430
And what do we do?

31:20.870 --> 31:24.150
The power station is located in
Transnistria. Day ride from here.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.240
Okay.

31:30.740 --> 31:33.340
Do you want me to lead?
You are driving five hours.

31:34.370 --> 31:36.370
No thanks, no.

31:37.380 --> 31:39.380
Okay.

31:47.250 --> 31:49.250
What? What?

31:51.550 --> 31:53.860
Someone is following us.

31:56.060 --> 31:58.060
Hold on, okay? Hold on

32:15.040 --> 32:17.040
Your mother!

32:17.190 --> 32:19.450
Your mother! Fuck off!

32:20.790 --> 32:22.790
Heck.

32:34.060 --> 32:36.060
Go to hell!

32:55.790 --> 32:57.790
Who was that?

32:58.920 --> 33:00.920
Who was that?

33:01.310 --> 33:03.310
I have no idea.

33:07.790 --> 33:10.890
Are you whole Yes. And you?

34:01.160 --> 34:03.160
Enough.

34:04.950 --> 34:08.600
You leafed through these
papers a thousand times. Stop.

34:15.270 --> 34:18.030
Well? What are you afraid of?

34:22.480 --> 34:24.480
What?

34:26.230 --> 34:28.230
I am afraid that I will be right.

34:30.630 --> 34:33.989
Then don’t worry. You
are always mistaken.

34:39.980 --> 34:41.980
Come on.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.280
Dad?

35:34.180 --> 35:36.180
What are you doing here?

35:36.510 --> 35:38.570
He brought you crucian carp.

35:39.610 --> 35:41.640
You have a beautiful house.

35:41.720 --> 35:44.580
You live like a master.
House prices are considerable.

35:50.810 --> 35:53.370
I have been living in London for
ten years. You have never come.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.480
The mountain does not
converge with the mountain.

35:57.600 --> 36:00.930
But now I'm here. Is not it?

36:03.590 --> 36:06.670
Is the girl in your
bed your girlfriend?

36:06.760 --> 36:09.280
No. But she is a good person.

36:09.760 --> 36:14.210
Your wife was also a good person...

36:16.620 --> 36:18.620
when I met you.

36:21.610 --> 36:23.610
And look what happened to her.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.520
What do you need?

36:29.110 --> 36:31.110
Leave her alone.

36:34.350 --> 36:36.710
You destroy everything

36:38.200 --> 36:40.200
what are you touching.

36:41.310 --> 36:43.560
You are a killer! Bastard!

36:44.100 --> 36:46.100
You are a killer!

36:47.110 --> 36:49.110
Bastard! You are a killer!

36:49.820 --> 36:52.410
Hey. What?

36:57.900 --> 36:59.900
Things are good? Massimo

37:22.430 --> 37:26.670
I will not hurt you, Sofia. Never.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.930
If they do nothing with their budgets,

37:32.010 --> 37:35.070
continuing with a deficit of
120 percent, such as in Italy,

37:35.150 --> 37:37.280
they will remain in isolation...

37:37.360 --> 37:40.430
That is why more and more countries
are starting to hate Germany again.

37:40.610 --> 37:42.610
Central Bank of Germany

37:42.700 --> 37:44.920
and politicians who
pursue only their interests,

37:45.000 --> 37:47.120
sacrifice the eurozone again...

37:49.380 --> 37:51.380
Mr. Morgan, I'm sorry

37:51.460 --> 37:53.460
but Mr. Becker did
not want to wait below.

37:53.540 --> 37:55.540
Need to talk. Cynthia, that's okay.

37:57.020 --> 37:59.470
Would you like some coffee?
What the hell, Dominic?!

37:59.550 --> 38:01.550
What are you doing?

38:01.630 --> 38:04.390
I don't need your fucking coffee,
I demand an explanation.

38:04.960 --> 38:07.140
You have not answered
my calls for two days.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.850
You said that we are
friends. And there is.

38:11.560 --> 38:14.110
So you told Massimo
Ruggiero to short my bank?

38:14.980 --> 38:17.440
Half of the European
traders follow him!

38:17.640 --> 38:19.640
We had a deal.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.730
Don’t blackmail me, Dominic.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.280
Your name is on those
papers next to mine.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.110
No, actually. Everything
was signed by Massimo.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.200
What? Did you hear me.

38:43.640 --> 38:46.840
I cannot fulfill your
request. Of course you can.

38:47.170 --> 38:49.790
No,
this is not fair. Not for conscience?

38:51.060 --> 38:54.120
Since when does conscience
relate to our affairs?

38:55.080 --> 38:57.800
NYL took a tough stance about the
default of the Italian public debt.

38:57.830 --> 39:00.020
Your bank should join us.

39:00.110 --> 39:04.900
Finance has nothing to do with it.
You are going to destroy the country!

39:05.920 --> 39:08.690
Destroy the lives of
millions of ordinary people!

39:09.400 --> 39:11.840
If Italy goes bankrupt,
the euro will collapse!

39:11.930 --> 39:13.930
Euro end!

39:16.070 --> 39:18.070
It is necessary to repay debts.

40:08.550 --> 40:13.300
Abandoned power plant
as collateral for 250 million?

40:13.770 --> 40:15.770
This is a fraud.

40:16.120 --> 40:18.670
Rubbish. As well as
other collateral for CDO.

40:19.380 --> 40:21.380
And Dominic knew about it.

40:23.950 --> 40:27.130
Ed Stuart found out
about this. We pinched him!

40:28.680 --> 40:30.680
I caught Dominic Morgan!

40:31.430 --> 40:33.580
Not really. Oh yeah!

40:33.660 --> 40:36.240
When I post these photos,

40:36.320 --> 40:38.880
I will destroy Dominic Morgan forever!

40:40.980 --> 40:43.650
On the contrary. You will destroy me.

40:48.170 --> 40:50.340
My signature on these CDOs.

40:52.310 --> 40:54.740
But how? This is what
I am trying to find out.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.930
Say you faked it. You
didn't kill Ed Stewart.

40:59.050 --> 41:01.590
Yes. Morgan killed him.
He is to blame for everything!

41:01.670 --> 41:03.670
Yes,
but I had a motive and an opportunity.

41:05.420 --> 41:07.940
And I'm involved in
the fraud he uncovered.

41:09.390 --> 41:11.940
So, if you publish the photo,
I will go to jail.

41:26.860 --> 41:29.480
Leave the paper at home. Hide them.

41:50.060 --> 41:52.390
How a runaway two-meter criminal...

41:52.540 --> 41:57.960
For many years, everyone believed that Bin
Laden would spend the rest of his life...

42:03.650 --> 42:05.840
Ah, there you are. Hey.

42:06.020 --> 42:09.590
Well? Did you find
anything in Moldova?

42:20.310 --> 42:22.620
Nothing. Only in vain flew.

42:41.550 --> 42:43.550
Eleanor

42:45.870 --> 42:48.110
Paul ordered the
cancellation of Reintaler shorts.

42:48.200 --> 42:51.360
And after half an hour we were ordered
to get rid of government bonds of Italy.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.470
Reintaler did the same.

42:53.550 --> 42:56.170
The eighth largest economy
in the world is kneeling.

42:56.260 --> 42:58.490
And no one wants to stop
it. I don’t understand why.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.640
That was the point!

43:34.850 --> 43:36.850
Now I got it.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.080
Really?

43:42.180 --> 43:44.460
Let me take this opportunity

43:44.540 --> 43:47.120
to dwell a little more
on monetary policy

43:47.200 --> 43:49.310
under the current embargo...

43:49.390 --> 43:51.730
You could not openly
destroy the country.

43:52.110 --> 43:54.350
Reintaler Bank did it for you.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.840
Italy is part of the pigs.

43:56.930 --> 43:59.250
Now - yes, thanks to you.

43:59.330 --> 44:01.330
But you have been
planning this for years.

44:01.600 --> 44:03.600
Please take a look around.

44:04.500 --> 44:06.500
Can we afford it?

44:06.970 --> 44:08.970
Yes, the bank gave me a bonus.

44:18.200 --> 44:22.330
Ed Stewart found out about the CDO
scam you used to blackmail Becker.

44:22.870 --> 44:25.790
And you offered him
my deputy position.

44:27.380 --> 44:29.380
But Ed refused a bribe.

44:34.020 --> 44:36.020
And you killed him.

44:36.120 --> 44:38.820
And faked my digital
signature on bonds,

44:38.900 --> 44:40.900
to shut me up if I find out the truth.

44:43.360 --> 44:46.530
It was you who tried
to stop me in Moldova.

44:53.890 --> 44:56.590
And it was you who
brought Carrie to London.

45:03.510 --> 45:05.510
Believe it if you want.

45:06.170 --> 45:08.170
I don’t want to believe it at all.

45:10.930 --> 45:12.930
But this is true.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.890
How many billions will you
get by destroying the country?

45:25.040 --> 45:27.150
It's not... Of course,
in them. In the money.

45:27.230 --> 45:29.230
It's not about the money.

45:29.870 --> 45:31.940
You didn’t want to be like a father.

45:34.390 --> 45:36.390
You started from the bottom.

45:37.440 --> 45:40.060
But you worked hard.
And made his way upstairs.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.490
You're not at the top yet.

45:46.390 --> 45:48.530
But when you get there

45:51.280 --> 45:53.680
you will see what the world really is.

46:10.540 --> 46:12.540
And how he remains so.

46:15.090 --> 46:17.120
I don’t know what I will see there.

46:19.630 --> 46:21.810
But now I see right through you.

46:21.890 --> 46:25.040
Follow my orders and you
will become a part of the future.

46:25.120 --> 46:28.790
Otherwise, I will destroy you.

46:33.210 --> 46:37.640
Dad? Dad!

46:46.750 --> 46:50.250
Dad? Dad?

47:22.050 --> 47:26.270
Mum! Mum!

47:32.100 --> 47:36.420
Phil Harvey compares unemployment
with a story about dogs and bones.

47:36.660 --> 47:41.470
You put 95 bones in the room and
send a hundred dogs there after them.

47:41.780 --> 47:43.940
Five of them will remain pitted.

47:44.090 --> 47:48.850
Economists take these five dogs aside.

47:49.140 --> 47:53.910
Courses on how to
grab a bone for a dog.

47:54.310 --> 47:56.720
Then they repeat the experiment.

47:56.800 --> 47:59.770
Send a hundred dogs
for ninety-five bones,

47:59.850 --> 48:02.990
and that five comes
back this time with prey.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.780
See? Anyone will get a bone

48:05.870 --> 48:08.910
you just have to train
hard and work hard.

48:09.080 --> 48:11.760
But the other five dogs were
left without bones anyway.

48:11.900 --> 48:14.410
Unemployment is five
percent of these dogs.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.970
They still won’t get the bone.

48:17.050 --> 48:19.790
The only solution to the
problem is to put five more seeds!
