You feeling any change?

32:34.720 --> 32:36.855
Can you talk?

32:36.887 --> 32:39.258
It's wearing off.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.792
Willow was here earlier.
She put the whammy on me,

32:41.826 --> 32:46.397
and then went straight
to the dark arts books
and sucked them dry.

32:48.200 --> 32:52.538
Look, Anya,
something terrible happened.
I know. Tara.

32:54.039 --> 32:58.176
Willow's out for blood big time.
We need to find her
before she finds Warren.

32:58.210 --> 33:01.613
Is there something you can do?
A locator spell?

33:01.646 --> 33:05.317
I don't need a spell.
I can feel her.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.385
You can--
 Feel her.

33:08.386 --> 33:10.989
Her thirst for vengeance,
it's overwhelming.

33:11.022 --> 33:16.728
Is that, like, left over
from your vengeance demon days,
this sensor?

33:16.761 --> 33:19.431
No. Not left over.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.636
[ Chuckles ]
Oh.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.873
Yeah.

33:27.905 --> 33:30.241
[ Door Bell Jingles ]
When?

33:30.276 --> 33:32.810
When do you think?

33:32.844 --> 33:34.980
Is everyone okay?
 Did Willow--

33:35.012 --> 33:37.449
Got her power boost
and took off.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.252
Anya's--
Anya was saying she knows
where Willow is.

33:41.287 --> 33:44.522
- A spell?
- Not exactly. It seems...

33:44.556 --> 33:47.425
Anya got her
vengeance on again.

33:47.459 --> 33:50.028
Oh.

33:50.061 --> 33:52.263
So, Willow's all wrathy.

33:52.298 --> 33:55.733
Why don't you go to her?
Isn't that your gig?

33:55.767 --> 34:00.571
Normally, I'd have to,
but she doesn't want me.

34:01.573 --> 34:05.310
- She wants to do it herself.
- Yeah.

34:06.577 --> 34:08.947
Look, Anya,
we don't have much time.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.250
Which side of this
are you on?

34:12.751 --> 34:16.255
If you know where she is,
you can help us.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.762
I'll help.
But I'm helping Willow.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.498
She's close to him.
He's in the woods.

34:54.159 --> 34:57.695
Run all night, Warren.
I'll still find--

35:19.985 --> 35:22.320
Ax-- not gonna cut it.

35:45.876 --> 35:48.380
Freeze!

35:58.824 --> 36:02.594
[ Gasps ]
That's cute.
That's a cute trick.

36:07.097 --> 36:09.268
It was an accident,
you know.

36:11.001 --> 36:15.306
Oh, you mean instead
of killing my best friend,
you killed my girlfriend?

36:15.340 --> 36:19.577
It-- It wasn't personal,
that's all.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.612
Well, this is.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.621
Capture!

36:52.978 --> 36:54.813
Irretite.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.224
Cute tricks.

37:07.259 --> 37:09.193
You are really asking for it,
you know that?

37:09.226 --> 37:11.797
I'm asking for it?

37:11.829 --> 37:14.465
I'm gonna walk away from this,
and when I do,

37:14.500 --> 37:17.335
you're gonna beg to go join
your little girlfriend.

37:18.503 --> 37:21.907
She wasn't your first.
Uh, f-first who?

37:21.940 --> 37:25.976
Tara. She wasn't
the first girl you killed.

37:26.010 --> 37:28.480
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Reveal!

37:28.514 --> 37:32.284
I should have strangled
 you in your sleep...

37:32.318 --> 37:34.652
back when we shared a bed.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.655
I should have done
the world a favor.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.425
[ Chuckles ]

37:39.458 --> 37:42.661
It's a trick.
 Why, Warren?

37:42.693 --> 37:44.795
You could have just let me go.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.666
Make it shut up.
Make it go away.

37:47.699 --> 37:51.469
It didn't have to
 be like that.
I'm not kidding!

37:51.503 --> 37:54.672
How could you say you loved me
and do that to me?

37:54.706 --> 37:57.608
Because you deserved it, bitch!

37:58.777 --> 38:01.813
Because you liked it.
Oh, shut up!

38:01.847 --> 38:05.516
You never felt you had
the power with her,
not until you killed her.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.918
Women. You're just like
the rest of them. Mind games.

38:07.952 --> 38:11.155
You get off on it.
That's why you had...

38:11.188 --> 38:13.992
a mad-on for the Slayer.
[ Chuckles ]

38:14.025 --> 38:16.927
She was your big "O,"
wasn't she, Warren?

38:16.961 --> 38:20.532
Are you done yet,
or can we talk some more
about our feelings?

38:20.565 --> 38:23.601
What's happening?
What do you feel?

38:23.635 --> 38:25.637
She's stronger now.
Close.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.507
What about Warren?
Has she--
He's still alive.

38:28.539 --> 38:31.108
She's not done.

38:31.141 --> 38:34.278
Help! Let me go.
Somebody!

38:34.311 --> 38:36.715
Help!
What's the matter?

38:36.748 --> 38:39.684
I thought you wanted
to talk.

38:41.487 --> 38:44.556
No.
Okay.

38:47.858 --> 38:50.561
I'll talk.

38:52.329 --> 38:55.300
What-- What are you doing?
Shh!

38:55.333 --> 38:57.902
Hey-- I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry!

38:57.936 --> 39:00.438
[ Breathing Heavily ]

39:02.239 --> 39:06.777
Wanna know what a bullet
feels like, Warren?
A real one?

39:07.445 --> 39:09.847
It's not like
in the comics.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.751
No. No.

39:12.784 --> 39:16.855
I think you need
to feel it.
Oh, God, stop it!

39:16.887 --> 39:19.590
It's not gonna make
 a neat little hole.
[ Groaning ]

39:19.625 --> 39:22.159
First, it'll obliterate
your internal organs.

39:22.193 --> 39:25.096
Your lung will collapse.
 It feels like drowning.

39:25.130 --> 39:28.266
Please, no.
When it finally
hits your spine,

39:28.298 --> 39:30.936
it'll blow your
central nervous system.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.938
Please, stop!
God, please!
I'm talking!

39:32.971 --> 39:35.273
[ Muffled Shouting ]

39:35.306 --> 39:39.777
The pain will be unbearable,
but you won't be able to move.

39:39.811 --> 39:43.949
A bullet usually travels
 faster than this, of course.

39:43.981 --> 39:47.284
But the dying--
[ Muffled Whimpering ]

39:47.318 --> 39:50.088
it'll seem like
it takes forever.

[ Muffled Shouting ]

39:52.590 --> 39:55.092
- Something, isn't it?
- [ Groaning ]

39:55.126 --> 39:58.096
One tiny piece of metal...

39:58.128 --> 40:00.097
destroys everything.

40:01.231 --> 40:04.302
[ Muffled Shouting ]

40:04.335 --> 40:07.505
It ripped her insides out,

40:08.306 --> 40:10.942
took her light away...

40:10.976 --> 40:13.277
from me,

40:13.311 --> 40:15.246
from the world.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.449
[ Muffled Whimpering ]

40:17.483 --> 40:21.286
Now the one person who
should be here is gone,

40:21.318 --> 40:24.856
and a waste like you
gets to live.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.793
A tiny piece of metal.

40:30.161 --> 40:32.030
Can you feel it now?

40:36.367 --> 40:39.804
- Over there.
- [ Muffled Shouting ]

40:39.838 --> 40:43.675
I said,
can you feel it?

40:45.342 --> 40:47.579
Please! God!

40:47.612 --> 40:49.581
I did wrong!
I see that now.

40:49.614 --> 40:52.983
I-- I need... jail!
I need--

40:53.018 --> 40:54.952
But you--
you don't want this.
You're--

You're not a bad person,
not like me.

you'll lose them too.

You don't want that.
