WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:06.939
WOMAN:
 See the New Yorker
 in the Chanel jacket

00:06.939 --> 00:08.476
that doesn't quite fit in?

00:08.476 --> 00:10.478
That's me, Dr. Zoe Hart.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.813
Yesterday, I took a cab
 to my job

00:12.813 --> 00:15.349
at one of Manhattan's
 best hospitals.

00:15.349 --> 00:19.187
Today, I'm on a bus
 in the middle of nowhere.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.224
But I guess my journey
 really began four years ago

00:23.224 --> 00:25.059
when I gave
 the commencement address

00:25.059 --> 00:27.027
at my medical school
 graduation.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.530
The first time I held a scalpel,
I was nine.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.998
My publicist mother complained

00:30.998 --> 00:32.466
that I didn't thank her enough
 in my speech.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.768
My dad and I snuck off
and dissected...

00:34.768 --> 00:36.970
But there was somebody
 in the crowd who liked it.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.972
Dr. Hart?

00:38.972 --> 00:40.541
It was quite
a speech.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.775
Thank you.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.777
My name is Dr. Harley Wilkes.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.513
I'm from BlueBell, Alabama.

00:45.513 --> 00:48.216
I have a small private
practice there.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.751
It's great town
with great people,

00:50.751 --> 00:52.052
and a great place

00:52.052 --> 00:54.288
for a young doctor
to hone her craft.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.057
I'd like to offer you a job.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.959
Thanks.
That's really flattering.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.394
But I have a plan.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.062
After I finish
my surgical residency,

01:02.062 --> 01:03.664
I'll do fellowship in thoracics.

01:03.664 --> 01:04.798
Then I'll go on

01:04.798 --> 01:06.800
to become a cardio-thoracic
surgeon like my dad.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.069
Our last name's Hart,
so it's predestined.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.704
Your offer is really sweet.

01:10.704 --> 01:11.872
Thanks, though.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.641
Bye.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.883
My mother never wanted me
 to be a surgeon.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.518
Congratulations!

01:24.518 --> 01:26.520
She thought the fluorescent
 lights would give me wrinkles.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.290
I know you'll be happy following
in your father's footsteps.

01:29.290 --> 01:32.793
Can't help but notice
he didn't make it.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.128
I know that must be
disappointing for you,

01:34.128 --> 01:35.263
but that's your father.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.064
Always thinking
about himself.

01:37.064 --> 01:39.700
He wanted to be here, but he
couldn't get out of Germany.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.902
Some diplomat needed
a pacemaker put in.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.904
Is that Katie Couric?

01:43.904 --> 01:45.239
Katie!

01:45.239 --> 01:47.775
Despite Mom's support,
 I had it all.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.977
The most amazing boyfriend
 who got what it was like

01:49.977 --> 01:51.579
to be a surgeon, too.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.248
Best part was, we both were
 going to do our residencies

01:54.248 --> 01:56.550
in the hospital
 where my dad did his

01:56.550 --> 01:59.187
in the best city
 in the world-- New York.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.554
My plan was on track.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.089
Well, it's four years later,

02:02.089 --> 02:05.326
and you know I wouldn't
 be sitting next to a guy

02:05.326 --> 02:07.328
who smells like fake cheese
 and chum

02:07.328 --> 02:09.830
if it had turned out
 like I hoped.

02:09.830 --> 02:14.468
First, the man
 I loved dumped me.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.470
Because I liked
 talking about surgery more

02:16.470 --> 02:18.005
than I liked talking
 about his day.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.741
But my dad taught me
 that to be a great surgeon,

02:20.741 --> 02:23.944
you can't let feelings
 get in the way.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.379
So, I kept my pain inside.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.948
I could because
 I was a shoe-in for...

02:27.948 --> 02:30.451
What do you mean, I didn't get
the cardio-thoracic fellowship?

02:30.451 --> 02:32.786
No one wanted this
more than me.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.555
I already did a solo
coronary bypass.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.057
Zoe, you've got the best hands
I've seen in 30 years,

02:37.057 --> 02:39.026
but if you want
to be a heart surgeon,

02:39.026 --> 02:40.628
then you got to work
on your own.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.296
By I do cardio five days a week.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.365
You know what I'm taking about.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.533
Last week,
you ignored Mr. Zucker

02:45.533 --> 02:47.235
when she asked you
to read to her.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.570
But I'm surgeon,
not a librarian.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.239
And Nicholas Sparks? Come on.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.874
This morning, when that guy
came in with Horner's syndrome,

02:53.874 --> 02:56.109
I'm the only one who
suspected aortic dissection.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.245
I saved his life.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.512
Yeah, but do you know his name?

02:58.512 --> 03:01.715
I need to be
a cardio-thoracic surgeon.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.917
What do I need to I do
to get next year's CT spot?

03:03.917 --> 03:06.119
You need to learn to see
patients as people to help,

03:06.119 --> 03:07.455
not puzzles to solve, so

03:07.455 --> 03:09.056
if you want my recommendation
next year,

03:09.056 --> 03:11.492
spend the next 12 months
as a general practitioner.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.394
First of all, diarrhea
and diaper rash?

03:13.394 --> 03:15.263
Ew. Second of all,
I will never work

03:15.263 --> 03:16.664
in private practice
without a specialty.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.132
There isn't a single GP job
in this whole city.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.268
That may be true,

03:20.268 --> 03:22.169
Dr. Hart, but there are
other places

03:22.169 --> 03:24.272
to practice medicine
besides New York.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.474
* *

03:28.208 --> 03:31.211
(scoffs)

03:36.750 --> 03:39.086
ZOE:
 Dad?

03:39.086 --> 03:41.822
No, I didn't get the fellowship.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.957
I know. Mom thinks
it's, like, a sign

03:43.957 --> 03:46.760
that I should be
a hand model or something.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.062
You still believe in me,
though, right?

03:49.062 --> 03:52.300
I know, I just have to figure
a few things out first,

03:52.300 --> 03:54.034
but then, look out.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.236
You're going to have a partner.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.907
Oh, I know
it's not that easy. I...

04:02.276 --> 04:04.912
Okay. You go.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.179
I love you, Dad.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.181
(phone clicks, dial tone hums)

04:08.181 --> 04:10.518
Dad.

04:11.652 --> 04:14.722
* *

04:14.722 --> 04:16.156
I was lost.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.459
Every fellowship was taken.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.194
I had put all my eggs
 in the wrong basket.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.696
But then I saw it.

04:22.696 --> 04:26.133
Another postcard
 from that Southern guy, Harley.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.302
He'd been sending me them
 the last four years,

04:28.302 --> 04:29.737
ever since graduation.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.473
My speech really
 must have inspired him.

04:32.473 --> 04:36.777
"Tark Twins keep wrestling
in poison oak.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.811
"Real busy.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.247
Could use an extra,
extra-talented hand."

04:40.247 --> 04:41.549
(voicemail beeps)

04:41.549 --> 04:44.084
Dr. Wilkes, this is Zoe Hart
leaving a message.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.986
You win.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.488
I'm on my way.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.357
DRIVER (over P.A.):
BlueBell, Alabama.

04:49.357 --> 04:52.192
Last stop on the Gulf Coast.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.595
It wasn't New York.

04:54.595 --> 04:58.599
It really, really
 wasn't New York.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.969
But I was going to figure out
 a way to make this work.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.971
First, I needed a cab.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.214
Can I offer you a ride, ma'am?

05:14.214 --> 05:17.718
Thank you,
but I have a strong policy

05:17.718 --> 05:20.621
against strangers chopping me up
into a million pieces.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.189
If it helps,
I'm-I'm an attorney,

05:22.189 --> 05:24.725
not an axe murderer.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.727
(sighs)

05:29.797 --> 05:32.032
All right, just...
just leave that there.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.634
I'll get it for you.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.137
Okay. Um, thank...
thank you.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.406
No problem.

05:38.406 --> 05:41.274
So, let me guess.
New Yorker?

05:41.274 --> 05:44.812
I lived in, uh, Tribeca for a
while, when I worked at Cravath.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.180
As in Cravath, Swaine and Moore?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.616
Yup.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.017
What are you doing here?

05:50.017 --> 05:52.820
Take it you're not in town
for the crawdads, huh?

05:52.820 --> 05:54.021
(laughs)

05:54.021 --> 05:56.323
Um, I've been exiled
from Manhattan.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.958
This is my purgatory.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.561
Well, if, uh,
you consider purgatory

06:00.561 --> 06:03.431
to be a place where neighbors
take care of each other,

06:03.431 --> 06:04.865
and, uh, every third Tuesday

06:04.865 --> 06:05.833
demands a parade.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.835
And you can call
it what you want, but

06:07.835 --> 06:10.538
I call it home.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.842
* *

06:30.658 --> 06:34.495
(indistinct chatter)

06:38.331 --> 06:40.468
Thank you.
No problem.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.137
I'm, uh, George Tucker.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.440
Zoe.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.677
Dr. Zoe Hart.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.580
Well, uh...

06:52.580 --> 06:55.616
Well, good luck, Dr. Zoe Hart.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.085
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.020
* *

07:36.356 --> 07:37.525
Hi.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.227
Hello?

07:40.227 --> 07:42.395
Is Dr. Wilkes around?

07:42.395 --> 07:45.699
What rock you been living under
the last four months?

07:45.699 --> 07:48.235
Harley passed away.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.237
What?

07:50.237 --> 07:52.105
He just sent me a postcard.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.076
Are you Zoe Hart?

07:56.076 --> 07:58.011
Yeah.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.948
He told me if I kept
sending you his postcards,

08:00.948 --> 08:03.283
eventually you'd show up.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.418
Guess he was right.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.688
Why would he want me
to show up?

08:07.688 --> 08:11.625
'Cause Harley left you
his practice.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.164
(laughs quietly)

08:33.480 --> 08:34.815
Thank you, ma'am.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.549
Okay. It's
beyond weird.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.051
Why me?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.787
Harley never
really explained.

08:39.787 --> 08:44.191
Well, clearly, the man was one
avocado short of a Cobb salad.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.760
Oh...
But oddly, it
works in my favor.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.229
This is the catch
of the day?

08:49.229 --> 08:51.098
What were you expecting?

08:51.098 --> 08:53.100
Sous-vide grouper
with a yuzu-mint gelée?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.636
It's a gulf.
We got catfish. It's fried.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.572
Ugh.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.874
You... Hmm.

09:00.874 --> 09:04.011
Look, Chief says I have
to spend a year as a GP,

09:04.011 --> 09:05.946
and I don't want
to waste a day,

09:05.946 --> 09:08.115
so notify the town
crier or whatever,

09:08.115 --> 09:10.317
and let him know
I'm open for business.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.819
Oh, no, no.
The thing is...

09:11.819 --> 09:14.655
See, technically, Harley only
left you half the practice.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.257
And he shares it
with Dr. Breeland.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.492
And Brick-- he's been
waiting a long time

09:19.492 --> 09:21.795
to get BlueBell
all to himself.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.496
Okay, well, let's
just find him.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.966
Tell him I'm here
for only a year,

09:25.966 --> 09:29.102
and then he can be the big fish
in the world's smallest pond.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.470
(laughs)
No. Brick's hunting.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.205
And that ain't
the sort of news

09:32.205 --> 09:33.874
you tell an Alabama man

09:33.874 --> 09:36.744
when he's got his hog rifle
locked and loaded.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.211
ZOE:
Whoa.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.213
* *

09:43.984 --> 09:46.720
Okay, someone needs to tell
the people of this town

09:46.720 --> 09:48.455
that's it's 2011.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.391
* *

09:51.391 --> 09:54.895
Dancing in celebration
of the Confederacy? Really?

09:54.895 --> 09:57.798
No. Dr. Hart, the Belles
are elite young ladies

09:57.798 --> 09:59.532
chosen to keep
our history alive.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.001
You mock all you want, but,

10:01.001 --> 10:02.369
actually, I wouldn't
do it out loud,

10:02.369 --> 10:03.971
because, uh, they're meaner
than they look.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.505
ZOE:
The Belles?
Mm-hmm.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.640
Emmeline, come on.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.108
Oh, you can call me

10:08.108 --> 10:09.242
Mrs. Hattenbarger.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.344
And my husband put the
satellite in last year.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.346
We watched every
episode of The Sopranos,

10:13.346 --> 10:16.549
and believe me, that family
has got nothing on these girls.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.219
When I heard there was a new

10:19.219 --> 10:21.321
lady doctor in town,
I painted myself

10:21.321 --> 10:25.025
quite a different picture,
but you are just so pretty!

10:25.025 --> 10:28.461
Zoe, this is Lemon Breeland.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.763
Oh, okay.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.631
You're Brick's daughter?

10:32.432 --> 10:33.667
All right. Um, yeah,

10:33.667 --> 10:35.068
it's really nice
to meet you.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.937
I'm dying to talk
to your dad.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.205
I know he's hunting or whatever,

10:38.205 --> 10:40.140
but you must have a way
to contact him?

10:40.140 --> 10:42.542
Oh. (laughs) Honey,
there's no need for that.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.144
He knows that you're here.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.647
And if I were you, I'd be gone
by the time that he returns,

10:47.647 --> 10:49.649
because Daddy can be quite...
imposing.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.084
(laughs)

10:53.653 --> 10:55.956
Well, you tell Daddy

10:55.956 --> 10:58.959
that if my medical career
hasn't been killed by my mother

10:58.959 --> 11:01.228
or the Chief of Surgery
at New York Hospital,

11:01.228 --> 11:03.697
it most certainly won't be
by some Southern xenophobe

11:03.697 --> 11:05.766
dressed up like
a stick of butter.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.436
Well, you have a good day.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.938
(giggles)

11:13.874 --> 11:15.675
I'm gonna see
some patients.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.411
Could you get me a venti soy
latte so I don't fatigue?

11:18.411 --> 11:20.580
The nearest
high-falutin' coffee place

11:20.580 --> 11:22.215
is 11 miles away.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.985
Thanks. That is
so nice of you.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.088
(exhales)

11:39.332 --> 11:41.869
(phone ringing)

11:44.204 --> 11:46.273
Mom. Hi.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.142
Sorry I haven't been answering.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.711
No, actually, there's
something I need to tell you.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.347
I moved to Alabama.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.382
Mom?

11:56.416 --> 11:58.285
Are you there?

12:01.388 --> 12:02.890
Is Dr. Breeland around?

12:02.890 --> 12:03.891
He's hunting.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.192
(phone rings)

12:05.192 --> 12:07.995
Uh... my mom.
(nervous chuckle)

12:07.995 --> 12:10.097
Freaking out.
I told her I moved here.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.331
What's up? You sick?

12:11.331 --> 12:14.902
Oh, I feel as good
as anyone my age would.

12:14.902 --> 12:18.338
But there's been a little
mix-up down at the DMV.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.707
Don't suppose
you could sign this

12:20.707 --> 12:21.975
for me?

12:21.975 --> 12:24.912
Let me give you
an eye test first.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.746
(phone ringing)

12:28.148 --> 12:29.382
(soft groan)

12:29.382 --> 12:31.819
Mom. Uh...
E, F, P,

12:31.819 --> 12:33.020
T, O, Z...

12:33.020 --> 12:34.754
(continues
reading chart)
No, you know

12:34.754 --> 12:35.923
what happened
with the fellowship.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.524
It's a GP position.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.525
...P, E, C, F...

12:38.525 --> 12:40.427
Alabama, Mom.
The state?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.796
...E...
No, I'm not having
a nervous breakdown,

12:42.796 --> 12:44.231
okay? I...
D, F, C,

12:44.231 --> 12:46.399
No, it's the
TV. Good-bye.
Z, P.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.402
All right.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.004
(sighs)

12:52.139 --> 12:53.273
Eh...

12:54.607 --> 12:56.476
Thank you very much.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.410
(clicks tongue)

12:57.410 --> 12:58.946
(chuckling)

13:03.450 --> 13:05.252
(door opens)

13:05.252 --> 13:06.987
Oh, my latte.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.957
Oh, yeah. Got thirsty
on the way and drank it.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.491
You got a patient.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.061
Oh.

13:14.061 --> 13:17.197
I'm using
subcuticular sutures.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.532
So there will barely
be a scar.

13:19.532 --> 13:23.270
Well, it's not like I'm gonna
catch a fella now.

13:23.270 --> 13:27.140
Hey, maybe you could give some
dating tips to my daughter here.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.708
You know that thing
about the potato chips,

13:28.708 --> 13:29.877
how you can't eat
just one?

13:29.877 --> 13:31.979
Big Mabel feels
that way about lunch,

13:31.979 --> 13:33.613
don't ya, honey?

13:33.613 --> 13:37.717
She's always been chubby, but
she's put on a good half ton

13:37.717 --> 13:38.919
since that
boyfriend of hers

13:38.919 --> 13:41.221
dumped her.
You're all set.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.490
Use the antibiotic
cream twice a day.

13:43.490 --> 13:47.094
Mabel, those dark
patches on your face,

13:47.094 --> 13:48.728
how long have
you had those?

13:48.728 --> 13:50.397
WOMAN:
I told her to
use sunblock.

13:50.397 --> 13:51.865
Come on.

13:51.865 --> 13:56.436
No offense, but we'll be seeing
Dr. Breeland from now on.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.238
You understand.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.012
Clearly, I needed
 someplace to live.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.346
Mrs. H. arranged for me

14:06.346 --> 14:08.916
to stay at
 the mayor's plantation.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.051
I was like, I'm not sleeping

14:11.051 --> 14:13.320
at some old confederate
 guy's house.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.622
But she said it was either that
 or the sidewalk.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.424
(doorbell ringing)
 So...

14:21.228 --> 14:22.595
No way!

14:22.595 --> 14:24.564
You're the mayor?

14:24.564 --> 14:26.699
Lavon Hayes, the linebacker?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.568
Two Super Bowls, five Pro Bowls.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.702
Four actually.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.438
Well, I rounded up.
You got robbed in '06.

14:31.438 --> 14:34.507
Oh, Lavon Hayes
likes your math.

14:34.507 --> 14:35.742
You must be Zoe.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.978
Yeah.
All right, let me show
you to your quarters.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.312
All right.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.813
I got it.
Are you sure?

14:40.813 --> 14:42.649
Lavon Hayes will
get your bags.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.851
Thank you.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.686
You know, you being
the mayor here

14:46.686 --> 14:49.122
is the first thing
about BlueBell that
I actually like.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.357
Thank you.
How'd that happen?

14:50.357 --> 14:53.927
Well, after ten
years in the NFL,

14:53.927 --> 14:56.930
I was a little lost.

14:56.930 --> 15:01.801
So, Lavon Hayes
moved back home.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.171
Having played for
the Crimson Tide,

15:04.171 --> 15:06.539
I was quite popular
around here.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.542
I ran, I won.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.944
(both laughing)

15:10.944 --> 15:12.946
Here it is.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.648
Let me get the door
for you.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.384
Watch your step.
Thanks.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.221
Well, sorry about the
look of the place.

15:21.221 --> 15:25.658
I think you could put your bags
in the back room there.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.431
Huh, it's not my loft
in Soho, but

15:31.431 --> 15:33.700
I'll order some stuff
from Barney's online.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.102
Make the place more homey.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.105
You share a generator
with the guy in the gatehouse.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.907
Looks after the place--
Wade Kinsella.

15:40.907 --> 15:44.911
If you've got your
curling iron going while
he's got his AC. on,

15:44.911 --> 15:47.214
could be trouble.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.250
Oh, if you do

15:50.250 --> 15:54.554
decided to wander, um, keep your
eyes peeled for Burt Reynolds.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.824
All right.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.392
What?

16:01.661 --> 16:03.663
* *

16:26.353 --> 16:29.289
(loud music playing
inside gatehouse)

16:36.629 --> 16:38.098
(woman laughing)

16:38.098 --> 16:39.366
MAN:
That sounds good.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.635
I'm crushing the
solo, ain't I?

16:42.635 --> 16:43.636
Whoo!

16:45.205 --> 16:47.940
I'm killing it.
You overheated
the generator.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.210
Nice nightgown.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.711
I'm Wade.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.713
Well, that smile might
make all the girls

16:53.713 --> 16:56.649
at the church social swoon, but
it's not going to work on me.

16:56.649 --> 17:00.687
Well, if you're not going
to be polite,

17:00.687 --> 17:03.656
I'm not going to show you
where the fuse box is.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.758
Good night.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.594
All right, Wade.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.028
WADE:
Keep going,
ladies, come on.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.530
I'm just getting
warmed up now.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.403
(gasps)

17:16.403 --> 17:18.405
(hissing)

17:19.205 --> 17:20.473
(screaming)

17:20.473 --> 17:23.742
(growling)

17:23.742 --> 17:26.846
Shh, shh, shh.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.080
George?

17:28.080 --> 17:30.250
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what?
Alligator.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.618
What?
An alligator!

17:31.618 --> 17:33.986
I'm sorry, I must have got
some mud in my ear.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.388
An alligator.
And alligator?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.657
Why didn't you say so?
That is an emergency.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.659
Just stay, stay back.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.297
Beat it, Burt.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.334
(grumbling)

17:48.601 --> 17:51.838
That's Burt Reynolds,
the mayor's pet alligator.

17:51.838 --> 17:55.074
His favorite movie's
 Smokey and the Bandit, so...

17:55.074 --> 17:56.909
That's funny.
Yeah.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.044
All right.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.546
Oh, come on.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.847
Hey, hey.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.782
I know you're a New Yorker
and everything,

18:02.782 --> 18:05.652
but down here in Alabama,
when somebody interrupts
their nightly jog

18:05.652 --> 18:07.954
to climb into the mud
to save our well-toned ass,

18:07.954 --> 18:09.389
we, you know, we say thank you.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.990
Oh, really?
Yeah.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.192
Oh.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.727
Well, thank you.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.665
I guess I'll be
seeing you around.

18:18.665 --> 18:19.866
Yeah.

18:19.866 --> 18:23.403
See? Hey, small towns
have their perks, huh?

18:27.106 --> 18:30.143
BlueBell isn't so horrible,
 Dad.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.512
The people here aren't so bad.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.681
Maybe I can make a difference.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.083
(call waiting tone)
I have another call.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.019
Call me.
Are you getting my messages?

18:40.019 --> 18:41.154
Bye.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.755
Hello.

18:42.755 --> 18:46.793
Did you sign Old Man Jackson's
eye exam for the DMV today?

18:46.793 --> 18:49.095
Yeah. Why?

18:49.095 --> 18:51.631
'Cause he just ran someone over.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.237
(sighs)

19:00.707 --> 19:03.142
Can't you tell
a legally blind man

19:03.142 --> 19:04.777
when he's right in front
of your face?

19:04.777 --> 19:06.713
All you had to do
was open his file!

19:06.713 --> 19:09.816
Everybody knows Old Man Jackson
memorized the eye chart.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.084
Oh, my God, I feel so bad.
I was distracted.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.287
Well, you should be.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.788
He nearly killed George Tucker.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.793
If you wanted to see me again,
you could have just asked.

19:20.793 --> 19:21.994
It's my shoulder.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.631
Just...
All right.

19:24.631 --> 19:25.898
Ready?

19:25.898 --> 19:27.166
(groans)

19:27.166 --> 19:28.735
It's dislocated.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.638
It's no big deal. I just
have to put it back into place.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.509
What the hell?!

19:36.509 --> 19:37.977
That's just the morphine.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.712
It's the easy part... baby.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.182
Eventually,

19:43.182 --> 19:44.451
you're going to find out

19:44.451 --> 19:46.052
this whole
getting-run-over-by-a-car thing

19:46.052 --> 19:47.254
was kind of my fault.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.855
(loud snap)
Ow! You did it again!

19:48.855 --> 19:51.391
Okay, have you never heard
of bedside manner?

19:51.391 --> 19:53.025
Why is everyone so obsessed
with that?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.595
Because it's nice!

19:55.595 --> 19:56.863
George?

19:57.664 --> 20:01.434
Good. Morphine's working.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.736
OMG, it's true.

20:03.736 --> 20:07.340
Rosie, honey, come on,
it's time for bed.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.676
Aunt Emmeline, this
is breaking news.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.878
Rose Hattenbarger,
BlueBell beat blogger

20:11.878 --> 20:14.247
for the otherwise torpid
official town Web site.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.616
So, how does it feel
to be responsible

20:16.616 --> 20:19.452
for maiming George
Tucker, town golden boy?

20:19.452 --> 20:21.621
He is not maimed.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.791
Off the record-- why would
anyone ever leave New York?

20:24.791 --> 20:26.393
New York is everything,
and I know.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.527
Read the Daily Intel,

20:27.527 --> 20:29.862
own all the SATC DVDs.

20:29.862 --> 20:30.997
I bet you're a Carrie.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.366
I'm a Charlotte, but
I wish I was a Carrie.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.503
You guys really like
your classic HBO, huh?

20:36.503 --> 20:39.539
But I am a Miranda who also
wishes she was a Carrie.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.808
I knew you and I were
going to be friends.

20:41.808 --> 20:44.411
Well, I guess I
could use a friend.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.314
Damn straight.
Brick's here.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.385
Hello, Pickle.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.253
Hi, Brick.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.789
Um, I'll see you later.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.190
We haven't met.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.559
I'm Dr. Zoe Hart.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.294
As far as I'm concerned,

21:01.294 --> 21:02.662
you're just the girl
who almost killed

21:02.662 --> 21:06.065
two people and spoiled
my hunting trip.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.100
How dare you see my patients.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.571
Well, technically, Harley left
his half of the practice to me.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.273
Miss Hart, I'm not going
to share this office--

21:14.273 --> 21:15.708
not for one minute.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.411
I see you have
met my lawyer.

21:18.411 --> 21:22.415
When he's conscious,
he doesn't lose.

21:22.415 --> 21:25.418
I'm going to be
contesting the will.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.654
Harley wasn't in his right mind.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.288
You haven't even
given me a chance.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.090
I believe
I can do some good here.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.992
Well, bless your heart.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.928
But things have been working
just fine here in BlueBell.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.097
We survived Katrina,
we survived BP,

21:38.097 --> 21:40.367
by boarding up the windows
and piling up the sandbags

21:40.367 --> 21:43.169
to keep the rot outside

21:43.169 --> 21:45.037
from fouling
our community.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.740
And believe you me, Zoe Hart,

21:47.740 --> 21:53.580
we are going to chase you away
from our waters.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.552
ZOE:
 Well, my night
 had quickly gone downhill.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.554
But in times like this,

22:01.554 --> 22:03.890
I find one thing
 really helps me through.

22:03.890 --> 22:09.295
Wine! Tell me you have
a nice dry chardonnay.

22:09.295 --> 22:11.097
Yup. Come on.

22:11.097 --> 22:14.233
You're Mabel, right?

22:14.233 --> 22:16.436
Bad day?

22:16.436 --> 22:18.237
You have no idea.

22:18.237 --> 22:19.806
Ugh. Oh, yes, I do.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.207
You met my mama?

22:21.207 --> 22:22.642
Oh, yeah.

22:22.642 --> 22:25.478
Yeah, my mom isn't
exactly supportive, either.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.782
Mabel, I know
it's none of my business,

22:29.782 --> 22:32.284
but the dark patches
on your forehead and face--

22:32.284 --> 22:33.753
you have melasma.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.221
You know you're
pregnant, right?

22:35.221 --> 22:36.589
I don't know that.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.525
I haven't taken a test.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.560
Well, I'm sure
you can get one here

22:40.560 --> 22:42.929
over by the Slim Jims
and duck calls.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.365
Long day.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.202
I didn't think...

22:50.202 --> 22:52.071
We only had sex once.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.774
He told me

22:54.774 --> 22:57.844
he wouldn't do it
if he had to wear a condom.

22:59.078 --> 23:02.449
I didn't want to lose him,
but he left anyway.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.717
So, my mother's right.
I'm stupid.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.987
Look, you need a doctor.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.089
Here. Take this.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.323
Can I have this?

23:11.323 --> 23:12.792
I'm gonna give you
my number,

23:12.792 --> 23:16.929
and you can call me,
and I won't tell anybody, okay?

23:16.929 --> 23:19.532
Okay, I'll take that.
Hmm.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.200
Thank you.
Owe you some money.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.370
Do you realize that my
engagement party is tomorrow?!

23:24.370 --> 23:26.138
Huh? I mean, what
am I supposed to do?

23:26.138 --> 23:27.474
The photographs!
The press!

23:27.474 --> 23:29.141
The whole thing's
just gonna be ruined!

23:29.141 --> 23:30.810
Seriously, Lemon,
what are you blabbering about?

23:30.810 --> 23:33.913
Well, thanks to you,
my fiancé was in a car accident.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.848
You're engaged
to Old Man Jackson?

23:35.848 --> 23:37.416
No, you twit.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.820
I'm engaged to George Tucker.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.657
(sighs)

23:44.657 --> 23:46.425
ZOE:
 Clearly, BlueBell
 wasn't the answer.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.562
I'd messed up as a doctor

23:49.562 --> 23:51.964
and gotten the guy
 I kind of liked run over.

23:51.964 --> 23:55.401
Oh, and it turns out
 he was engaged.

23:55.401 --> 23:57.637
* *

23:59.539 --> 24:02.475
I had sunk to my lowest point.

24:02.475 --> 24:06.913
Well, maybe not my lowest.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.247
Nice first day.

24:08.247 --> 24:10.717
Everyone knows Old Man J
memorized the eye chart.

24:10.717 --> 24:13.019
Don't you have some cows to tip,

24:13.019 --> 24:14.253
Wade?

24:14.253 --> 24:16.055
Oh.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.323
Look at you, girl.

24:17.323 --> 24:18.991
You're drunk as a boiled owl.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.427
I'd offer to give
you a ride, but

24:21.427 --> 24:23.963
I don't want you
getting any ideas.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.536
ZOE:
 I was making out
 with the electricity-stealing

24:29.536 --> 24:31.403
buffoon from next door.

24:31.403 --> 24:34.574
But it gets worse.

24:34.574 --> 24:35.441
(grunts)

24:35.441 --> 24:37.343
(car horn plays "Dixie")

24:37.343 --> 24:39.612
(both panting)

24:39.612 --> 24:41.147
There it is.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.481
Rock bottom.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.783
Oh, my God.

24:43.783 --> 24:46.619
I just played "Dixie"
with my butt.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.788
This never happened.
You hear me?

24:48.788 --> 24:51.558
My lips are sealed, Doc.

24:51.558 --> 24:54.326
(sighs, muttering)

24:54.326 --> 24:56.428
How do I get...?
Get me out.

24:56.428 --> 24:58.030
(door squeaks)

24:58.030 --> 24:59.431
Oh! Oh! Ow!

24:59.431 --> 25:00.567
(Zoe panting)

25:00.567 --> 25:01.768
(car doors closes)

25:01.768 --> 25:04.036
(car engine starts)

25:04.036 --> 25:06.038
* *

25:10.943 --> 25:11.911
Mom!

25:11.911 --> 25:14.681
What the hell are you thinking?

25:20.587 --> 25:24.290
I get that you feel
you had no choice.

25:24.290 --> 25:28.194
What I don't understand is why
this Harley would try so hard

25:28.194 --> 25:29.528
to get you down here.

25:29.528 --> 25:33.332
I mean, no offense. Your speech
was great, but really, why?

25:33.332 --> 25:34.801
I'm not sure.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.703
It's possible he was nutballs.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.270
I don't care what
the chief said.

25:38.270 --> 25:41.507
Nothing is worth you
spending a year here.

25:41.507 --> 25:43.175
And your father
agrees with me.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.276
Wait. You talked to Dad?

25:44.276 --> 25:46.613
Well, he called me after
he heard your message

25:46.613 --> 25:47.780
that you left last night.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.582
How do you think
I found you?

25:49.582 --> 25:51.751
Well, he called you
instead of me?

25:51.751 --> 25:53.185
Um, you know him.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.087
He can't deal
with complications.

25:55.087 --> 26:00.426
But, honey... do
you belong here?

26:00.426 --> 26:03.863
Let's go home.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.031
ZOE:
 She was right.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.833
I didn't belong in BlueBell.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.768
We made arrangements
 to leave at 5:00.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.236
I called George.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.771
That was awkward.

26:11.771 --> 26:14.173
He asked to meet me
 on the pier.

26:14.173 --> 26:17.009
Guess he wasn't dying
 to be seen with me in public.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.477
Can't say I blamed him.

26:18.477 --> 26:22.248
Glad to see
you're feeling better.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.016
(sighs)

26:24.016 --> 26:25.785
Uh, I know you have
your party to get to,

26:25.785 --> 26:27.887
but this is
time-sensitive.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.022
I'm going back
to New York this afternoon.

26:30.022 --> 26:34.260
Really? I'll take it
that, uh, exile was lifted?

26:34.260 --> 26:36.595
Can I have the papers, uh,

26:36.595 --> 26:38.631
for, you know, signing
over half the practice

26:38.631 --> 26:39.666
to Brick?

26:39.666 --> 26:40.933
Yeah, of course.

26:40.933 --> 26:44.236
I, uh... I heard about
your run-in with Lemon

26:44.236 --> 26:45.905
last night, and I...

26:45.905 --> 26:47.406
I-I should have told you.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.708
What? That you're engaged?

26:48.708 --> 26:51.043
I mean, between

26:51.043 --> 26:52.344
the alligator
and getting hit by a car,

26:52.344 --> 26:55.081
you kind of had a lot
going on last night.

26:55.081 --> 26:59.318
Look, you should've known Lemon
when we were younger.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.552
I mean,

27:00.552 --> 27:03.923
she's funny,
she's irreverent.

27:03.923 --> 27:07.326
And I just was honored
that she...

27:07.326 --> 27:09.561
that she chose me.

27:09.561 --> 27:12.031
But, uh,

27:12.031 --> 27:13.766
you know, after law school,
I just...

27:13.766 --> 27:15.835
I needed, uh... change.

27:15.835 --> 27:18.604
You know, so I decided
to move to New York, and

27:18.604 --> 27:21.741
I loved it in the city.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.978
But I woke up dreaming
about the sunset,

27:25.978 --> 27:28.114
and, uh, having sand
beneath my feet,

27:28.114 --> 27:30.316
and I realized that BlueBell,

27:30.316 --> 27:32.785
and, uh, Lemon...

27:32.785 --> 27:35.121
they're who I am.

27:35.121 --> 27:39.759
You know, can't really be
my best self without them.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.795
Wow. You're a lucky guy.

27:44.130 --> 27:47.066
A girl you feel the same way
about as a town.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.403
The papers?

27:51.403 --> 27:53.740
(sighs)

27:53.740 --> 27:55.474
Thanks.

27:55.474 --> 27:58.711
Uh, I'll mail them
when I get back to New York.

27:58.711 --> 28:00.479
Okay.

28:00.479 --> 28:03.750
Good-bye, George Tucker.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.188
* *

28:17.730 --> 28:21.267
(phone ringing)

28:21.267 --> 28:23.669
Hello?

28:23.669 --> 28:25.604
(whispering):
Dr. Hart?

28:25.604 --> 28:26.773
It's Mabel.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.707
I don't feel...

28:28.707 --> 28:30.242
well.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.211
But I'm-I'm working
at the Breelands'.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.413
I can't leave.
Can you come here, please?

28:34.413 --> 28:36.015
Mabel, I have a plane.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.684
If you're at the Breelands', why
don't you just talk to Brick?

28:38.684 --> 28:40.386
Brick the dick? No way!

28:40.386 --> 28:43.355
You said you'd be my doctor
if I needed you.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.358
Didn't you take an oath
or something?

28:46.358 --> 28:47.827
(sighs)

28:47.827 --> 28:49.428
ZOE: I know I'm
not invited,

28:49.428 --> 28:50.562
but I'm a doctor.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.964
This is a
medical emergency.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.000
Silly, this is
Brick Breeland's house.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.168
He is the doctor.

28:57.904 --> 29:01.307
Actually, she's
here with me.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.910
Lavon Hayes.
Mayor.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.277
Yeah.
(chuckles)

29:05.277 --> 29:07.646
I do believe
that entitles me
to a plus one.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.148
Mm-hmm.

29:09.148 --> 29:12.018
* *

29:17.756 --> 29:19.959
LAVON:
How you doing,
ladies?

29:19.959 --> 29:22.161
Good to see you.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.864
Thank you.
I gotta go find Mabel.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.165
Oh? Well, not a problem.

29:26.165 --> 29:29.836
This party could use
a little shaking up.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.303
(chuckles) I do believe

29:31.303 --> 29:33.139
Lavon Hayes needs
himself a cocktail.

29:34.140 --> 29:37.443
Look, I am sorry
about the photographs.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.312
I know how hard
you planned today and...

29:40.312 --> 29:42.882
Oh, honey, I don't care
about the pictures.

29:44.183 --> 29:45.852
That much.

29:45.852 --> 29:48.220
(both chuckle)

29:48.220 --> 29:50.322
I don't know what's
become of me.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.391
All the stress from
the wedding has

29:52.391 --> 29:55.461
just turned me into a
real... 'Bama beeotch.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.528
But...

29:56.528 --> 29:58.965
I love you.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.733
I really do.

30:01.733 --> 30:05.237
And nearly losing you last night
just reminded me of how much.

30:05.237 --> 30:09.241
And I promise
that I'm gonna try

30:09.241 --> 30:12.044
real hard to be
the same old Lemon

30:12.044 --> 30:14.813
that you fell in love with,
okay?

30:19.185 --> 30:20.786
ZOE: Oh! (clears throat)

30:20.786 --> 30:22.821
Uh, Zoe?
What are you
doing here?!

30:22.821 --> 30:23.856
Is everything okay?

30:23.856 --> 30:25.724
I came with the mayor.

30:25.724 --> 30:27.559
Lavon?

30:27.559 --> 30:30.129
Okay, well,
uh, welcome.

30:30.129 --> 30:34.400
And the bar is over...
that way.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.769
Thought you said she
was leaving town.

30:37.769 --> 30:39.538
I thought she was.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.013
(groaning)

30:47.813 --> 30:48.881
Mabel?

30:48.881 --> 30:51.050
Thank you so much for coming.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.751
I'm having these bad pains.

30:52.751 --> 30:55.087
Oh, my God,
there's another one.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.822
Okay.
(groans)

30:56.822 --> 30:58.790
Oh, they're getting worse.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.859
Mabel, how long has it been
exactly

31:00.859 --> 31:02.294
since your last period?

31:02.294 --> 31:03.429
Not sure.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.264
(groans)

31:05.264 --> 31:06.132
Another one?

31:06.132 --> 31:07.599
They're 15 seconds apart.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.601
Okay, Mabel, stay calm.

31:09.601 --> 31:12.138
Look, we're not gonna make it
to the hospital.

31:12.138 --> 31:14.740
You're having a baby,
and you're having it now.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.475
Come on.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.116
(Mabel gasps)

31:24.116 --> 31:26.152
What is going on here?

31:26.152 --> 31:27.553
Brick, she's ten centimeters,
ready to push.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.121
Contractions are on
top of each other.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.456
We need to deliver this baby.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.724
No, I need to deliver this baby.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.127
Have Emmeline get me my
medical bag, my drug box.

31:35.127 --> 31:36.628
Get me some towels.
No, no, no, no, no,

31:36.628 --> 31:37.896
don't you come near me!

31:37.896 --> 31:40.166
Dr. Hart and I,
we're in this together.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.433
She's my doctor.

31:41.433 --> 31:44.503
Guess I'll be needing
the towels.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.739
Okay, Mabel, Mabel,

31:47.739 --> 31:49.041
are you ready?

31:49.041 --> 31:51.277
I'm gonna need you to
start pushing, okay?

31:51.277 --> 31:53.879
I'm gonna come
check on you later.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.047
Make sure
you're all right.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.949
All right.

31:56.949 --> 32:01.153
So, Mr. Mayor,
is it true?

32:01.153 --> 32:05.357
You're here on a date
with that, uh... Dr. Hart?

32:05.357 --> 32:07.393
(dry chuckle)

32:07.393 --> 32:09.628
How is that any
of your business?

32:09.628 --> 32:11.163
I mean, if I do recall,

32:11.163 --> 32:14.466
we are at your
engagement party.

32:14.466 --> 32:17.669
Lavon...

32:17.669 --> 32:19.938
come on.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.141
You know how difficult
this is for me.

32:24.243 --> 32:27.013
Difficult never stopped me.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.521
You're doing great, okay?

32:35.521 --> 32:36.555
I see the head.

32:36.555 --> 32:37.656
Another contraction.

32:37.656 --> 32:40.559
I need you to push again
on the count of three.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.995
One, two, three.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.663
Go, go. Push!

32:44.663 --> 32:45.597
Oh, no!

32:45.597 --> 32:46.999
(groaning)

32:48.034 --> 32:49.135
(panting)

32:49.135 --> 32:51.270
Brick, the shoulder.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.471
It's lodged in the pelvis.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.073
(groaning)

32:54.073 --> 32:55.741
Push her head back in,
I mean...

32:55.741 --> 32:57.209
The ambulance is on the way.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.944
They'll have to do
a C-section in Mobile.

32:58.944 --> 33:00.246
Isn't that 20 miles away?

33:01.580 --> 33:02.581
(moaning)

33:04.150 --> 33:07.153
All right. Mrs. H, I need you
to hand me my scalpel.

33:07.153 --> 33:09.221
What are you doing?
A symphysiotomy.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.223
No, I can't let you slice
open her pelvis like that.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.591
It is way too dangerous.

33:12.591 --> 33:13.725
We have no choice, okay?

33:13.725 --> 33:15.627
This baby comes out now,
or we lose both of them.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.265
(Mabel breathes hard, moans)

33:20.132 --> 33:21.533
Okay, Mabel?

33:21.533 --> 33:23.469
I'm going to give you
a local to dull the pain,

33:23.469 --> 33:26.072
but I can't have you numb
for when you need to push.

33:26.072 --> 33:27.706
You're going to feel
a little pinch.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.508
Ready?

33:29.508 --> 33:30.842
Ahh!

33:30.842 --> 33:33.545
(whimpering)

33:33.545 --> 33:34.880
Now, I need you two

33:34.880 --> 33:37.183
to hold her steady until
it's all over, no matter what.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.817
And after she delivers,

33:38.817 --> 33:40.852
I'm going to close her
up as soon as possible.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.589
Brick, that means the baby's
all you. Are you with me?

33:43.589 --> 33:44.590
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.092
ZOE:
Okay. Ready?

33:46.092 --> 33:47.826
Hang on, hang on.
Come on.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.628
(screaming):
I-- ow, ow, no,

33:49.628 --> 33:52.198
please, please,
it hurts too much!

33:52.198 --> 33:54.200
Losing way too much blood.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.634
(moans)
Come on, Mabel.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.503
(crying weakly)
Mabel, don't you pass out on me.

33:57.503 --> 33:58.970
Mabel, come on.
I need you to push.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.606
BRICK:
Hey.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.208
ZOE:
I know you're tired, and
I know you're in pain,

34:02.208 --> 34:03.509
but I need you to be strong.
Stronger than you've

34:03.509 --> 34:05.811
ever been in your entire life.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.813
You can do this.

34:07.813 --> 34:10.081
Now give me one big push.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.283
Here you go.
Okay?

34:12.118 --> 34:15.053
(screaming, crying)

34:16.955 --> 34:18.889
* *

34:18.889 --> 34:21.427
(baby crying)

34:25.831 --> 34:27.632
Oh...

34:31.503 --> 34:33.438
Is she okay?

34:33.438 --> 34:34.639
Yeah.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.478
She got ten fingers
and ten toes,

34:39.478 --> 34:43.114
and those lungs that would
make Carrie Underwood jealous.

34:43.114 --> 34:46.118
BRICK:
You got yourself
a healthy baby girl.

34:46.118 --> 34:48.587
(baby coos)

34:51.822 --> 34:53.159
(Mabel laughs quietly)

34:53.159 --> 34:54.760
BRICK:
Nice job.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.962
You know, it's too bad you're
not going to be staying.

34:56.962 --> 34:59.731
George told me you were going
to sign the practice back over.

35:02.901 --> 35:06.305
Well, I'll go tell the
paramedics we're fine.

35:08.874 --> 35:09.941
Mabel,

35:09.941 --> 35:12.110
what you did for
your daughter...

35:12.110 --> 35:14.280
you were amazing.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.183
Don't ever forget
how much strength you have.

35:25.724 --> 35:26.792
A baby?!

35:28.994 --> 35:30.562
You have got to be kidding.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.198
I have a patient
recovering here.

35:32.198 --> 35:33.365
Dr. Hart, it's okay.

35:37.002 --> 35:38.704
Look, Mama...

35:40.672 --> 35:45.811
I made a beautiful,
perfect person.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.078
How she grows up,

35:47.078 --> 35:48.214
(sniffs)

35:48.214 --> 35:50.949
how she looks at herself,

35:50.949 --> 35:52.451
that's on me now.

35:55.287 --> 35:58.357
And I'm not gonna
expose my baby to you.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.195
So, please...

36:03.195 --> 36:05.564
get out.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.179
Yeah...

36:21.179 --> 36:22.180
(door slams shut)

36:22.180 --> 36:25.384
(Mabel giggles)

36:26.385 --> 36:29.321
You ju...
You just can't leave now.

36:31.390 --> 36:34.393
Thank you, Mrs. H.

36:34.393 --> 36:36.094
That means a lot,
coming from you.

36:36.094 --> 36:39.398
I was happy
I could help.

36:40.232 --> 36:42.768
It was nice.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.403
Great, actually.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.072
But I mean, come on.

36:47.072 --> 36:48.440
BlueBell?

36:48.440 --> 36:50.342
I don't fit in here.

36:50.342 --> 36:52.344
Everybody hates me.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.580
Plus the humidity is
really ruining my hair.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.751
I'm not a family doctor.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.487
I'm gonna be
a cardio-thoracic surgeon.

37:01.487 --> 37:03.889
I've known since I was nine.

37:03.889 --> 37:07.225
I just have to figure out
another way.

37:09.361 --> 37:12.831
You asked me before why Harley
left you his practice.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.502
I didn't tell you
the whole truth.

37:16.502 --> 37:18.704
I didn't think it
was my place. But...

37:18.704 --> 37:22.240
I've been carrying this
around since, uh...

37:22.240 --> 37:24.443
since you got here.

37:26.545 --> 37:30.115
Didn't know if I should
give it to you, but...

37:30.115 --> 37:31.883
Here.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.955
That's my mom.

37:36.955 --> 37:38.056
And...

37:38.056 --> 37:40.726
Harley?

37:40.726 --> 37:43.128
Yeah, Zoe.

37:43.128 --> 37:46.532
Harley Wilkes
was your father.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.769
Wha...?

37:52.371 --> 37:54.573
You're here! Great!

37:54.573 --> 37:57.509
There's a superb Sancerre
chilling in the car.

37:57.509 --> 38:00.111
We need to talk.

38:00.111 --> 38:03.382
Oh, my...
Oh my God.

38:03.382 --> 38:04.683
Zoe, I can explain.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.385
What's there to explain?

38:06.385 --> 38:08.620
That my entire life
has been a lie?

38:08.620 --> 38:11.790
This is the answer to
everything, isn't it?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.992
Why Harley left me
the practice,

38:13.992 --> 38:15.594
why Dad stopped loving me?

38:16.795 --> 38:20.265
Because I wasn't his to love.

38:20.265 --> 38:22.601
He knew, didn't he?

38:24.670 --> 38:27.406
When you were ten,
you fell off the swings,

38:27.406 --> 38:30.008
they thought you would
need a transfusion.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.010
But when he donated blood...

38:34.413 --> 38:36.648
He tried to stay
in your life,

38:36.648 --> 38:38.183
but I guess it was too hard.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.051
That's why he left?

38:41.520 --> 38:42.521
And what about Harley?

38:42.521 --> 38:44.690
Why not tell me about him?

38:44.690 --> 38:46.858
Was he a psycho?
A pedophile? What?

38:46.858 --> 38:48.627
He was a mistake.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.496
I met him on a cruise.

38:50.496 --> 38:51.730
It was Greece.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.365
He was handsome,
older, a gentleman.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.866
It was a fantasy.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.502
But I was engaged.

38:56.502 --> 38:59.237
To someone real.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.373
Did you love him?

39:01.373 --> 39:03.775
It doesn't matter.

39:03.775 --> 39:07.546
I did not belong with him,
just as my child

39:07.546 --> 39:10.916
does not belong
in a place like this.

39:10.916 --> 39:13.284
I gave you a father
who was from our world.

39:13.284 --> 39:15.654
I protected you.

39:15.654 --> 39:17.423
That should've been my choice.

39:17.423 --> 39:20.559
I am sorry,
Zoe, okay?

39:20.559 --> 39:23.395
I am truly,
deeply sorry.

39:23.395 --> 39:26.432
But, please,
can we just go home

39:26.432 --> 39:28.700
and discuss this in therapy
like normal people?

39:28.700 --> 39:30.802
You go.

39:33.138 --> 39:35.741
I'm staying here.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.780
(sighs)

39:42.781 --> 39:44.416
ZOE:
 Growing up, I was told

39:44.416 --> 39:47.185
that to be a surgeon,
 I couldn't let myself feel.

39:47.185 --> 39:49.788
But then, I came to BlueBell.

39:49.788 --> 39:52.758
All the food here is fried.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.962
The whole town smells like mold.

39:56.962 --> 40:00.632
And clearly, the sex
education system is lacking.

40:01.700 --> 40:05.236
They could use a good doctor.

40:05.236 --> 40:08.339
One who cares
about her patients.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.809
Maybe, even though you're gone,

40:10.809 --> 40:12.911
there are still some things
you can teach me.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.551
(sighs)

40:19.551 --> 40:24.456
No one ever believed
in me like you did.

40:24.456 --> 40:28.193
You kept sending me
those postcards...

40:28.193 --> 40:29.895
knowing one day I'd be lost.

40:29.895 --> 40:35.934
(voice cracking):
And maybe following in your...

40:35.934 --> 40:37.469
(sighs)

40:37.469 --> 40:38.770
my real father...

40:38.770 --> 40:43.074
your footsteps for a while, um,

40:43.074 --> 40:46.912
I might find my way.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.914
(sniffs)

40:51.783 --> 40:54.786
Thanks.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.161
* *

41:14.205 --> 41:16.942
(cell phone ringing)

41:18.810 --> 41:20.478
Hi.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.681
Zoe, where are you?

41:22.681 --> 41:24.049
I got the Tark Twins here again.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.951
ZOE:
Let me guess.
They were wrestling

41:25.951 --> 41:27.352
in poison oak?

41:27.352 --> 41:28.453
You got it.

41:28.453 --> 41:30.421
I'll be right there.

41:30.421 --> 41:32.323
See you soon, Dr. Hart.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.025
