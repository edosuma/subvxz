02:29.831 --> 02:33.579
We had lost some very good men there.

02:33.751 --> 02:37.001
Toye and Guarnere had lost
their legs there.

02:37.171 --> 02:42.296
Gordon was badly hit.
A number of other people were killed.

02:42.468 --> 02:45.967
It was a difficult situation there.

02:46.138 --> 02:51.179
I don't know the exact amount
of men that got killed in that.

02:51.351 --> 02:57.140
But six, seven of them were
real close friends of mine.

02:57.566 --> 03:01.646
Skip Muck died and Eugene Roe
came to me…

03:01.820 --> 03:05.271
about 10 minutes
after he was killed.

03:05.448 --> 03:08.698
He wanted to see
if I wanted to go look at him.

03:08.868 --> 03:13.162
I said, “No. I wouldn't be able
to stand that”. So I didn't go.

03:13.331 --> 03:15.952
After Bastogne, we went to Haguenau.

03:16.125 --> 03:20.668
We wanted to see what was across
the river, what strength they had.

03:20.838 --> 03:23.542
You feel you'll live through the war.

03:23.716 --> 03:28.211
You have a feeling
it's starting to ease off.

03:28.387 --> 03:30.593
You can't account for it…

03:30.764 --> 03:34.429
it's a gut feeling,
but everybody had that feeling.

03:34.601 --> 03:38.183
I believe I might be able
to live through it.

03:38.354 --> 03:43.063
So walk carefully.
Take care of yourself.

04:08.675 --> 04:13.420
What the 101st Airborne did in the
Battle of the Bulge made it famous.

04:13.596 --> 04:17.185
Papers called them
“The Battered Bastards of Bastogne”.

04:17.225 --> 04:21.449
They were now pulling into
the comparative paradise of Haguenau…

04:21.562 --> 04:25.311
the sounds of the war
coming from across the river.

04:25.483 --> 04:27.107
I had missed Bastogne.

04:27.276 --> 04:30.775
I knew what I heard
around the replacement depot.

04:30.946 --> 04:33.698
That the war would soon be over.

04:33.866 --> 04:35.941
Thanks for the lift.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.828
When I was able to rejoin
Easy Company…

04:40.038 --> 04:44.166
they didn't look like heroes
who just helped win the war.

04:46.544 --> 04:48.751
–George Luz!
–Yeah?

04:48.921 --> 04:52.125
It's me. Come on,
I haven't been gone that long.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.135
Jesus. Yes, you have.

04:56.387 --> 04:58.178
Now, look what I've found.

04:58.347 --> 05:00.838
Hey, guys. Sgt Martin, Sgt Ran—

05:01.058 --> 05:03.216
What do you want, private?

05:04.186 --> 05:08.184
Sorry, sir. I'm David Webster,
I'm back from the hospital.

05:08.357 --> 05:10.314
Good for you.

05:12.903 --> 05:16.271
–Where's the rest of the guys?
–This is everybody.

05:16.448 --> 05:19.532
Come on, Sgt Martin,
this can't be everybody.

05:19.701 --> 05:23.615
What about Hoobler, where's he?

05:26.791 --> 05:31.038
You know, Lt Foley, 2nd Platoon
lost more guys than we did.

05:31.212 --> 05:33.121
They're really short-handed.

05:33.297 --> 05:36.333
Report to 2nd.
They'll find you a place.

05:36.508 --> 05:40.043
Next truck up, Webster,
you'll find 2nd. Move.

05:53.024 --> 05:54.566
Hey, guys.

05:54.734 --> 05:58.399
Some lieutenant told me
to report to 2nd.

06:01.449 --> 06:04.864
–Your name's Jackson, right?
–That's right.

06:05.369 --> 06:07.942
Who's leading the platoon?

06:08.455 --> 06:10.578
–Sgt Malarkey.
–No officers?

06:10.791 --> 06:13.246
–I guess you didn't hear.
–No, what?

06:13.418 --> 06:17.083
They're making him lieutenant.
He's on the fast track.

06:17.255 --> 06:19.663
–Really? That's great.
–Isn't it?

06:19.841 --> 06:22.379
Jackson, help me up, will you?

06:30.310 --> 06:34.177
–So you come from the hospital?
–Yeah.

06:34.355 --> 06:39.349
Must have liked that hospital, because
we left Holland four months ago.

06:39.527 --> 06:43.654
I wasn't only there. There was
rehab, the replacement depot.

06:43.822 --> 06:47.772
I'm sure you tried to bust out
and help us in Bastogne.

06:47.951 --> 06:52.079
–How would I have done that?
–Popeye found a way.

06:52.247 --> 06:55.830
So did Alley, back in Holland.
And Guarnere—

06:56.001 --> 06:59.037
Where is Guarnere?
He still platoon sergeant?

06:59.212 --> 07:00.492
–No.
–Let's go.

07:00.672 --> 07:02.960
–He got hit.
–Yeah?

07:03.299 --> 07:06.549
Yeah, Bill got hit.
Blew his whole leg off.

07:06.719 --> 07:09.720
1st Platoon, moving out!

07:12.850 --> 07:16.800
Hold along this line till
I figure out where we're going.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.470
Sarge? Sarge—

07:29.950 --> 07:33.401
What's the matter, Webster?
Nervous in the service?

07:33.578 --> 07:35.867
No, no, I'm fine, sarge.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.242
Go make sure Capt. Speirs
wants you with us.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.620
Capt. Speirs?
What happened to Capt. Winters?

07:42.795 --> 07:45.630
He's running the whole battalion now.
Go.

07:45.798 --> 07:49.961
Easy Company had a new CO
to go with the other new faces.

07:50.135 --> 07:53.967
The guys I knew were gone
or different than I remembered.

07:54.139 --> 07:59.679
I went through D-Day and Market Garden,
but because I had missed Bastogne…

07:59.853 --> 08:04.978
I was treated as a replacement
and felt like I was starting all over.

08:05.150 --> 08:08.601
–Look who it is. Nice digs, huh, Lip?
–Yeah.

08:08.778 --> 08:11.020
–Sgt Lipton?
–Look what I found.

08:11.197 --> 08:14.364
–Feeling all right?
–He's got pneumonia.

08:14.534 --> 08:15.565
I'm sorry.

08:15.743 --> 08:20.903
Why? He's alive, he's got a couch,
a goddamn blanket. He's snug as a bug.

08:21.332 --> 08:25.376
Sgt Malarkey said to check
if I should be in 2nd Platoon.

08:25.544 --> 08:29.127
Have a seat, Webster.
We'll get you situated.

08:30.382 --> 08:32.955
How long have you been sick?

08:33.135 --> 08:35.044
Long enough.

08:36.804 --> 08:41.383
–He wants us to cross the river.
–Yeah, I bet that water's cold.

08:41.558 --> 08:44.726
Should be able to get you some boats.

08:45.271 --> 08:50.431
Had to be a full moon.
So much for the cover of darkness.

08:50.609 --> 08:53.100
It's gonna leave the patrol exposed.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.774
–Is this the company CP for Easy?
–Yes, sir.

08:59.952 --> 09:03.617
As you were.
Lt Jones looking for Capt. Speirs.

09:04.122 --> 09:07.242
He's on his way, sir.
Why don't you sit down?

09:07.417 --> 09:09.742
Can you get me coffee?
Want coffee?

09:09.920 --> 09:12.078
–No, thank you.
–All right.

09:16.676 --> 09:18.668
What platoon are you in?

09:18.845 --> 09:21.170
We're about to find that out.

09:21.347 --> 09:25.261
–You got any soap? I need a shave.
–I'll send some down.

09:25.434 --> 09:29.052
–Know what you'll do?
–I'll let Speirs handle it.

09:29.396 --> 09:32.979
Capt. Speirs, sir. This is Lt Jones.

09:33.150 --> 09:37.361
Will you go back and sack out?
There's beds with fresh sheets.

09:37.529 --> 09:41.361
I will, sir. Just trying
to make myself useful, sir.

09:42.284 --> 09:43.529
Listen up.

09:45.078 --> 09:47.569
Regiment wants patrol for prisoners.

09:47.747 --> 09:51.365
This one comes from Col. Sink,
so it's not my idea.

09:51.542 --> 09:55.173
The river is the line of resistance.
We have to cross it.

09:55.213 --> 09:56.541
What do we do?

09:56.714 --> 09:59.999
There's a three-story building
on the enemy side.

10:00.176 --> 10:05.217
It's occupied. You can have 15 men.
Think hard about who you want to lead.

10:05.389 --> 10:10.015
You'll need a scout, a translator.
The battalion's on covering fire.

10:10.185 --> 10:12.308
–When?
–Tonight. 0100.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.602
–Yes, sir.
–Speirs?

10:14.773 --> 10:16.516
I want this to be safe.

10:16.942 --> 10:21.520
Don't take any chances on this one.
We're too far along for that.

10:21.696 --> 10:24.566
Speirs? I wanna discuss
who might go.

10:24.741 --> 10:27.741
–Who are you?
–Lt Jones, sir.

10:27.910 --> 10:30.484
Right, our West Pointer.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.907
–Yes, sir.
–When did you graduate?

10:33.082 --> 10:34.280
June 6, sir.

10:34.458 --> 10:37.412
June 6? Of last year?

10:37.586 --> 10:39.626
D-Day, yes, sir.

10:40.881 --> 10:43.586
All right, don't get hurt.

10:43.759 --> 10:46.843
Sir, I'd like to volunteer
for the patrol.

10:48.138 --> 10:50.759
–Speirs, talk to you in an hour.
–Yeah.

10:51.182 --> 10:52.677
Lt Jones.

10:52.851 --> 10:57.347
We're short on officers.
You think a non-com could lead this?

10:57.522 --> 11:00.891
I can think of a few possibilities.

11:01.275 --> 11:03.184
Martin? Malarkey? Grant?

11:03.361 --> 11:08.651
–Most of the NCOs could use a rest.
–Captain. Request permission to go.

11:09.867 --> 11:12.073
There's your answer.

11:12.494 --> 11:15.697
No. You don't have any experience.

11:15.873 --> 11:18.577
–Report to 2nd Platoon.
–Yes, sir.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.079
Tell…

11:21.128 --> 11:24.543
Tell Heffron, Ramirez
and McClung they're going.

11:24.714 --> 11:26.173
Yes, sir.

11:26.341 --> 11:28.417
Sir, this is Pvt. Webster.

11:28.593 --> 11:31.214
Sir, I'm Pvt. Webster
from 1st Platoon.

11:31.387 --> 11:33.961
I just got back from the hospital.

11:34.140 --> 11:37.094
Lt Foley said go to 2nd,
but Sgt Malarkey—

11:37.268 --> 11:41.052
–Fine, 2nd. Take…
–Lt Jones.

11:41.230 --> 11:44.350
Lieutenant. OP 2.

11:50.072 --> 11:51.566
Come on.

11:58.246 --> 12:02.824
–Are other officers in the platoon?
–No, sir, just Sgt Malarkey.

12:03.001 --> 12:08.125
He's getting a battlefield commission.
Maybe he'll be assisting you.

12:08.297 --> 12:11.334
Who's that? Webster?

12:11.509 --> 12:13.715
Yeah. How you doing, Sgt Kiehn?

12:13.886 --> 12:15.546
–Hi, Webster.
–Hi, sarge.

12:15.721 --> 12:19.849
–Look what we scrounged. We got spuds.
–Is OP 2 this way?

12:20.642 --> 12:23.264
Shit! Move! Go!

12:25.731 --> 12:27.723
Shit, they spotted us!

12:27.899 --> 12:29.939
–Is that it?
–I think so.

12:30.151 --> 12:32.440
Go! Go! Go!

12:36.074 --> 12:39.110
Come on!
Get over here, get over here!

12:41.787 --> 12:43.910
All clear! All clear!

12:44.081 --> 12:45.659
Okay, okay.

12:54.466 --> 12:55.877
Ready?

12:57.094 --> 13:01.886
–Wait. It was Heffron, McClung and—
–Ramirez. Come on.

13:04.809 --> 13:08.558
–Hey, guys, this taken?
–Go ahead.

13:12.150 --> 13:17.606
Sergeant, this is Lt Jones,
just assigned to 2nd Platoon.

13:17.780 --> 13:19.322
Platoon Sgt Malarkey.

13:19.490 --> 13:22.906
Congratulations on the
battlefield commission.

13:23.494 --> 13:27.326
–The what?
–They're making you an officer, no?

13:27.831 --> 13:31.366
Me? No. You must be thinking
of 1st Sgt Lipton.

13:31.543 --> 13:35.623
My mistake. So you're
without a platoon leader?

13:35.797 --> 13:38.584
Not any more, lieutenant.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.759
Right.

13:44.681 --> 13:47.765
So you wanna introduce me to the men?

13:48.976 --> 13:54.018
Well, some are sleeping downstairs.
The rest are right here.

13:58.360 --> 14:03.603
Sergeant, a patrol's being planned
for tonight, 0100. Across the river.

14:03.782 --> 14:07.447
Regiment wants POWs
for interrogation.

14:07.953 --> 14:09.363
What's the situation?

14:09.538 --> 14:10.948
–Hey, Web.
–What?

14:11.122 --> 14:13.957
Come here.
I wanna talk to you a second.

14:14.125 --> 14:15.323
Why?

14:15.502 --> 14:18.455
–You want some coffee?
–No.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.955
–Fifteen.
–Fifteen what?

14:21.132 --> 14:22.460
Looeys since D-Day.

14:22.633 --> 14:25.124
–Any mortars?
–60s out back.

14:25.303 --> 14:27.679
–He out of high school?
–West Point.

14:27.847 --> 14:30.931
West Point? Isn't that where Ike went?

14:31.100 --> 14:35.512
–Yeah. He graduated with his son.
–Shit. So…

14:37.314 --> 14:40.065
What do you know
about this patrol thing?

14:40.233 --> 14:42.609
–Nothing.
–You gotta know something.

14:42.777 --> 14:45.399
–I don't.
–Bullshit.

14:45.989 --> 14:49.571
You were at the CP.
This is a prisoner snatch, right?

14:49.742 --> 14:52.364
Hey, Chuck, listen to this.

14:52.912 --> 14:55.913
Come on, Webster. Spill it.

14:58.584 --> 15:02.083
Capt. Speirs is to pick 15 men.

15:02.254 --> 15:05.374
Lt Jones wants to be one of them.

15:05.549 --> 15:08.799
Let the kid go.
He could use the experience.

15:08.969 --> 15:12.053
Probably could find
14 replacements to help.

15:12.264 --> 15:15.846
I take it this was an outpost
when you arrived?

15:16.017 --> 15:19.272
Doggies from the 79th Infantry.
They left quickly.

15:19.312 --> 15:23.974
–What's the report on enemy activity?
–Expect flares, some mortars.

15:24.150 --> 15:25.692
Scattered 88s, snipers.

15:25.860 --> 15:29.276
Yeah, we dodged some mortars
on our way in.

15:31.282 --> 15:35.445
We also got some sort
of railroad gun back there.

15:35.619 --> 15:40.696
Shells the size of a deuce and a half.
Sounds like a freight train.

15:40.874 --> 15:44.919
–They didn't try to cross the river?
–No.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.047
They have roofs over their heads,
like us.

15:48.215 --> 15:52.212
I don't think anybody wants
to do anything stupid now.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.339
–I know you know.
–Just give us the names.

15:55.513 --> 15:56.888
Who?

15:58.808 --> 16:04.680
There are three men in this room that
they think should be on the patrol.

16:06.023 --> 16:07.683
Who?

16:09.276 --> 16:12.610
If I tell you,
you can't let on that you know.

16:12.780 --> 16:16.030
Your secret's safe, Web.
Who is it?

16:21.288 --> 16:24.372
–Yeah. Heffron.
–Oh, shit!

16:24.541 --> 16:26.165
McClung.

16:29.295 --> 16:31.003
And you.

16:33.841 --> 16:38.836
–He want anyone from another platoon?
–No. I don't know. Not that I know.

16:39.013 --> 16:41.718
Look, that's all I know. I'm sorry.

16:42.141 --> 16:45.510
So it's McClung, Heffron and Ramirez?

16:46.603 --> 16:52.190
–I'll tell them, I just need you to—
–Listen up! Got some bad news.

16:54.903 --> 16:58.735
There is a patrol set for tonight.
Speirs wants McClung—

16:58.907 --> 17:00.615
–We know.
–We just heard.

17:00.784 --> 17:02.942
Webster here told us.

17:04.913 --> 17:06.490
Easy White.

17:07.999 --> 17:09.327
Yep.

17:12.211 --> 17:15.046
Okay. All right. Out.

17:16.048 --> 17:20.093
The PX rations just came in.
Including winter shoe-pacs.

17:20.260 --> 17:22.503
–Beautiful.
–Yeah, finally, right?

17:22.679 --> 17:26.511
–Now we're in a nice, warm house.
–Also, we got showers.

17:28.226 --> 17:30.978
All right! Let's move! Clear it out!

17:35.483 --> 17:37.025
Incoming!

17:37.193 --> 17:40.147
Come on, go! Get down, stay low.

17:52.124 --> 17:54.247
–You okay?
–Yeah, I'm all right.

17:54.418 --> 17:56.042
Showers. Let's go.

18:06.054 --> 18:08.806
–Somebody's been hit!
–Where?

18:09.974 --> 18:12.644
–What's happened?
–Casualty!

18:12.935 --> 18:15.509
–Who is it?
–Bill Kiehn!

18:15.688 --> 18:20.101
I just left him. I was on my way back.

18:20.901 --> 18:24.104
In war, soldiers sometimes die
in a fire-fight…

18:24.321 --> 18:27.939
or by artillery when they're
huddled in a foxhole.

18:28.117 --> 18:34.071
Bill Kiehn was killed because
he was carrying a sack of potatoes.

18:34.247 --> 18:37.616
In the wrong place at the wrong time.

18:38.043 --> 18:41.708
He was dead before Doc Roe
heard the call for a medic.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.287
Get him out of here, will you?

18:44.591 --> 18:48.374
–Hey, let's go. Let's get out of here.
–Yeah, okay.

18:53.933 --> 18:58.226
–Did you know him well?
–No, not really.

19:16.287 --> 19:19.288
–McClung.
–Thanks.

19:22.293 --> 19:24.001
Malarkey.

19:28.340 --> 19:34.793
Grant, Jackson, Wynn, Liebgott,
Powers and Webster. All right?

19:36.974 --> 19:39.643
2nd Platoon, on me!

19:46.191 --> 19:48.895
All right, I'm leading this patrol.

19:50.028 --> 19:55.484
C.O wants Grant, Liebgott,
Wynn, Jackson…

19:55.658 --> 19:59.027
Shifty from 3rd Platoon
and Webster.

19:59.203 --> 20:01.326
–They want anyone from 1st?
–No.

20:01.497 --> 20:04.249
Is there anyone
they don't want from 2nd?

20:04.416 --> 20:07.168
That list sounds like everybody to me.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.079
It's always 2nd Platoon.

20:09.254 --> 20:14.379
–If we were three, they'd want us.
–I can't believe Malarkey's leading.

20:14.551 --> 20:17.718
He's lost 5 friends.
What's he got to live for?

20:17.888 --> 20:21.885
Has it been a long time since
your last shower, professor?

20:32.151 --> 20:35.686
–Come on.
–Is it hot water or cold?

20:38.532 --> 20:41.652
–Come on. Hurry up, will you?
–All right.

20:54.506 --> 20:58.752
–I guess I don't really need a shower.
–I don't either.

20:59.260 --> 21:01.004
–Lieutenant?
–Yeah?

21:01.179 --> 21:04.512
–You still wanna get your ODs dirty?
–Of course.

21:04.682 --> 21:07.054
I was just thinking.

21:07.685 --> 21:11.385
Sgt Malarkey's in no condition
to be on this patrol.

21:11.564 --> 21:14.683
Maybe if you offered,
you could go instead.

21:14.858 --> 21:18.310
–You're an officer.
–They want someone experienced.

21:18.487 --> 21:21.274
The guys they picked
have plenty of that.

21:28.329 --> 21:32.409
Lt Jones wanted to experience
combat before the war ended.

21:32.584 --> 21:37.874
Don Malarkey had been
on the front-lines since D-Day.

21:38.047 --> 21:43.088
If they could switch places for the
patrol, it would be a small justice.

21:43.260 --> 21:47.174
As welcome as a hot shower
and a fresh uniform.

21:47.348 --> 21:50.847
The decision, though,
was not theirs to make.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.646
Johnny, you're breaking my heart.

21:55.814 --> 21:59.230
Come on, George.
Give me, I don't know, 15 bars.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.681
Juicy Fruit. Happy?

22:00.860 --> 22:05.652
Movement reported. 1st Sgt Lipton
wants you to shoot into a house.

22:05.823 --> 22:10.035
–Could we get a Hershey bar?
–Luz, you're 1st Platoon at heart.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.528
–There's not enough.
–Hershey bars!

22:12.705 --> 22:14.329
–Jesus!
–Wait your turn!

22:14.498 --> 22:16.082
–Who they for?
–Not you.

22:16.208 --> 22:19.873
–One bar.
–No, there's not enough to go around!

22:20.045 --> 22:22.916
–Is Capt. Speirs here?
–By the river, sir.

22:23.090 --> 22:25.960
Hey, big-mouth,
give the kid a Hershey bar.

22:26.134 --> 22:28.312
–You're kidding.
–Look who it is.

22:28.428 --> 22:30.800
I like what you did with the place.

22:30.972 --> 22:33.216
Yeah, I did good.
How you feeling?

22:33.391 --> 22:35.598
–I'll be fine.
–Have a Hershey.

22:35.894 --> 22:38.017
–Thanks.
–He gets a Hershey bar?

22:38.188 --> 22:39.765
He got shot in the ass.

22:39.939 --> 22:44.103
–Did I say to stick your ass out?
–No, but I expect sympathy.

22:44.277 --> 22:45.652
I should rub it?

22:45.820 --> 22:49.070
Try to get him out of the war,
he comes back.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.240
I heard the Krauts are finished.

22:52.409 --> 22:56.489
Well, to make sure,
we gotta row across the river tonight…

22:56.663 --> 22:59.450
grab a few and ask them in person.

22:59.625 --> 23:02.709
–Are you kidding?
–Wish I was. Welcome back.

23:02.878 --> 23:06.792
That reminds me, Web.
I need you to run these to OP 2.

23:06.965 --> 23:11.591
Grenade launchers for the night
patrol. Any day now. There you go.

23:11.761 --> 23:14.217
Hey, you know what? Send these too.

23:14.389 --> 23:17.888
Hear what happened
on D Company's patrol last night?

23:18.059 --> 23:20.929
Replacement lieutenant
blew his foot off.

23:21.103 --> 23:24.686
Fresh from West Point.
Had to come back empty-handed.

23:24.857 --> 23:27.182
Maybe he was a friend, lieutenant.

23:27.359 --> 23:28.770
What you got there?

23:28.944 --> 23:32.229
More Hershey bars
and Lucky Strikes to hoard?

23:32.406 --> 23:34.529
Cobb, with the mouth, please.

23:34.700 --> 23:37.866
The kid's just trying
to do his job, all right?

23:38.036 --> 23:42.081
To hell with it. Count them, Vest.
I gotta blast this house.

23:42.248 --> 23:44.157
–You happy?
–Coming, Perco?

23:44.334 --> 23:47.204
Watch this shit for me.
Web, come with me.

23:47.378 --> 23:49.454
Will Capt. Speirs be there?

23:49.630 --> 23:51.676
–Same vicinity.
–I'll join you.

23:51.841 --> 23:54.676
–Where we going?
–The house I gotta blast.

23:54.844 --> 23:59.636
–Will Capt. Winters be with him?
–Jesus. Look, I don't know. Maybe.

23:59.974 --> 24:02.096
–I'm coming too.
–Come on, guys.

24:02.267 --> 24:05.517
–Give me a bar.
–I'm supposed to watch them.

24:05.687 --> 24:08.973
Come on, you don't smoke.
I got a wounded ass.

24:09.566 --> 24:12.401
Did Intelligence give
you any information?

24:12.652 --> 24:14.479
Third house on the left.

24:14.738 --> 24:17.642
When the men are in boats,
I want a quad 50.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.650
Captain Winters?

24:19.867 --> 24:22.619
I feel that I should
go on the patrol.

24:22.870 --> 24:25.492
I know I could use the experience.

24:26.249 --> 24:28.490
Denied. Anything else?

24:29.460 --> 24:33.078
You're not gonna lead that patrol,
Lieutenant Jones.

24:36.592 --> 24:39.296
Permission to speak, sir.

24:42.055 --> 24:43.170
Go on.

24:43.348 --> 24:45.724
Sergeant Malarkey
could use a break.

24:45.976 --> 24:50.721
He said that he did not mind
if I took his place on the patrol.

24:50.939 --> 24:52.812
That was nice of him.

24:55.318 --> 24:56.860
–Captain Winters?
–Yes.

24:57.111 --> 25:00.361
I'd really like to be
on that patrol, sir.

25:00.615 --> 25:03.651
If it's true the Krauts
are finished…

25:03.909 --> 25:09.532
I haven't really done anything except
deliver mail and type morning reports.

25:09.790 --> 25:13.870
–Absolutely.
–Thank you, captain.

25:15.837 --> 25:20.333
–He has a point about Sergeant Malarkey.
–Yeah, a point.

25:23.053 --> 25:27.465
Fine. You can go.
There will be a briefing. CP, 1700.

25:27.724 --> 25:29.301
Yes, sir.

25:31.686 --> 25:35.979
So who do you have in mind leading
this thing, if not Malarkey?

25:38.526 --> 25:42.440
Come on, he can't be leading.

25:44.072 --> 25:47.026
I'm not sure what they decided.

25:48.535 --> 25:52.864
No way. Not on his first day.

25:53.123 --> 25:56.408
Well, do you see any
other officer here?

26:08.304 --> 26:11.838
–What?
–They call you guys too?

26:12.099 --> 26:14.970
So who's in charge of this bullshit?

26:16.520 --> 26:17.931
No, he ain't.

26:18.105 --> 26:21.438
If he ain't, it's you, Chuck.
Or Shifty or Mo.

26:21.692 --> 26:23.850
Well, that would be better.

26:24.111 --> 26:27.111
–Ten-hut!
–Jesus.

26:27.364 --> 26:28.941
At ease.

26:32.118 --> 26:34.158
–Gentlemen.
–Sir.

26:34.370 --> 26:38.997
We've assembled 15 of you for this
prisoner snatch tonight, 0100.

26:39.458 --> 26:44.167
We've secured four rubber
boats to get you across the river.

26:44.421 --> 26:50.460
Lieutenant Jones here is the ranking
officer. He'll be along as an observer.

26:50.719 --> 26:53.922
Martin will lead the patrol
in Malarkey's place.

26:54.097 --> 26:56.767
Battalion will cover
your withdrawal.

26:56.933 --> 26:59.603
We've identified targets,
planned fire.

26:59.769 --> 27:05.143
We hear the whistles, we open up.
Don't blow them until you're in the boats.

27:05.316 --> 27:07.143
If the house is empty?

27:07.318 --> 27:11.612
It won't, but we know it's an outpost
and want it destroyed…

27:11.823 --> 27:14.195
so lay some demo
on a time delay.

27:14.367 --> 27:18.411
Move fast, but carefully.
Put a perimeter around the house.

27:18.579 --> 27:22.584
Get your rifle grenades in the window,
and the assault team in.

27:22.624 --> 27:27.963
Good. Remember, it's about prisoners.
Don't pop the first thing that moves.

27:28.213 --> 27:31.000
–Clear?
–Yes, sir.

27:31.258 --> 27:32.752
Good.

27:35.095 --> 27:37.004
Picked your assault team?

27:37.180 --> 27:43.384
McClung, Sisk, Cobb, Garcia
and Webster, as translator.

27:43.644 --> 27:47.856
The rest of you guys,
a base of fire with Sergeant Grant.

27:50.943 --> 27:56.364
–You speak German, right, Webster?
–Yeah. A little bit.

27:56.615 --> 27:59.948
Good. That's my team, sir.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.825
–Questions?
–No, sir.

28:04.081 --> 28:08.659
–Good. Good luck.
–Thank you, sir.

28:08.918 --> 28:12.583
–Ten-hut!
–As you were. Carry on!

28:16.843 --> 28:18.634
A little German?

28:19.762 --> 28:22.383
His German's as good as mine.

28:27.269 --> 28:31.349
–Jackson. Here you go. You need this.
–Thanks.

28:31.523 --> 28:36.019
Can you believe that guy? Webster.
Tries to get out of everything.

28:36.236 --> 28:38.027
Whatever.

28:40.407 --> 28:44.155
–I want four men on each block.
–I was thinking about…

28:44.327 --> 28:47.328
Four men to go in,
four on the left flank…

28:47.497 --> 28:50.201
–Sir? Sir?
–Yes?

28:50.458 --> 28:53.957
–Liebgott and I, we both speak German.
–Yeah?

28:54.211 --> 28:58.291
You said 15. There are 16 of us,
including two translators.

28:58.466 --> 29:02.380
Well, fine. Hey, Liebgott.
You wanna sit this one out?

29:02.553 --> 29:03.584
Yes, sir.

29:03.762 --> 29:07.890
–You wanna supervise the three squads?
–Thanks, buddy.

29:08.141 --> 29:11.226
–Thank you, sir.
–Yeah.

29:12.854 --> 29:15.559
You men going on patrol…

29:15.774 --> 29:19.522
nothing rattles, nothing shines,
no helmets.

29:27.076 --> 29:28.903
Lieutenant?

29:36.210 --> 29:37.918
Thank you.

29:52.350 --> 29:54.343
You set for tonight?

29:55.228 --> 29:58.098
–I'm ready.
–Those Krauts will catch hell.

29:58.356 --> 30:00.147
So I hear.

30:01.943 --> 30:06.688
–I'm not personally going in.
–Martin, right?

30:06.947 --> 30:12.321
Martin and McClung. I'm supposed to
stay in the rear and give them cover.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.570
It's the best place to be.

31:33.196 --> 31:38.985
Fifteen men crossing a river to
capture prisoners from a German post.

31:39.327 --> 31:43.656
Getting back safely could be
accomplished in 10 minutes.

31:43.831 --> 31:48.042
The same mission could be met
with disaster, and result in…

31:48.210 --> 31:51.211
15 Americans killed
or wounded in action.

31:51.380 --> 31:55.757
Those of us who had seen combat
put that out of our minds.

31:56.009 --> 32:01.348
Those who hadn't probably thought of
little else as we waited for darkness.

32:34.170 --> 32:35.546
–Any problems?
–No.

32:35.797 --> 32:39.545
It's secured to the tree.
No sign of any AP mines.

32:39.801 --> 32:41.378
Let's go.

32:49.310 --> 32:51.184
Webster, come on.

33:04.825 --> 33:07.660
Keep it steady, keep it steady.

33:10.830 --> 33:13.997
Oh, shit. I can't swim!

33:14.250 --> 33:16.824
Garcia, grab Sisk.

33:20.840 --> 33:25.383
Okay, keep going. Come on,
stay focused. Come on, come on.

33:28.514 --> 33:32.262
Use the rope.
Use the rope. Come on.

33:37.647 --> 33:39.142
Cutters.

33:43.611 --> 33:45.106
Good.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.272
To the side.

33:47.991 --> 33:49.983
Let's go. Come on.

33:51.953 --> 33:53.744
Clear.

33:55.623 --> 33:58.114
Easy there. Clear.

34:14.056 --> 34:17.507
Powers, go! Go, McClung.

34:23.232 --> 34:25.308
McClung, move up.

34:27.152 --> 34:30.023
In twos, up.

34:57.432 --> 35:00.468
Powers, Wynn, secure the left flank.

35:00.726 --> 35:05.933
Lieutenant, take Grant and Heffron,
secure the right and the crossroads.

35:06.190 --> 35:09.226
Security out. Go. Move.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.984
Jackson, hold on!

35:57.864 --> 35:59.442
Let's go!

35:59.783 --> 36:02.238
Jackson! Wait!

36:08.124 --> 36:09.286
Put it down!

36:09.500 --> 36:12.335
Keep your hands up
where I can see them!

36:14.004 --> 36:16.246
Keep those Krauts quiet!

36:18.133 --> 36:19.711
Jackson.

36:20.636 --> 36:24.135
Vest, take care of him.
Ramirez, watch Vest.

36:24.389 --> 36:27.723
Let's go, Webster, let's go!
Come on!

36:28.727 --> 36:31.218
–Check them for weapons.
–Cover me!

36:31.479 --> 36:36.853
Keep those men quiet!
McClung, cover him!

36:37.110 --> 36:39.019
Prime and bury the charges!

36:39.195 --> 36:42.279
Shut up, you two!
And pick him up.

36:42.531 --> 36:47.905
McClung, these two are gonna carry
the wounded Kraut. Webster, tell them!

36:48.162 --> 36:53.037
I said, shut up! Ramirez, pick up
Jackson. We're moving out!

36:53.208 --> 36:56.659
Where are you going?
Everybody moves on my command!

36:56.920 --> 36:58.913
Are you ready? Are you ready?

36:59.172 --> 37:02.873
Shut up, you! Come on!
We all go together!

37:03.969 --> 37:07.800
Let's go! Move! Move out!
Let's go! Move! Move!

37:09.390 --> 37:11.632
Webster, come on!

37:16.105 --> 37:20.019
Powers, fall back! We're moving out!

37:20.192 --> 37:23.442
Keep those prisoners' heads down.
Keep moving!

37:23.612 --> 37:27.906
Wynn, fall back!
We're moving out! Let's go!

37:30.035 --> 37:34.163
We're falling back!
Covering fire!

37:37.792 --> 37:42.253
Heffron, I want you to fall back now!
Let's go!

37:44.882 --> 37:47.967
Move! Get back to the boat!
I'll cover! Go!

37:48.219 --> 37:50.674
Keep those men moving!

37:58.228 --> 38:01.597
Lieutenant, take the whistle!
Let's go!

38:01.857 --> 38:06.483
–Go! Move it, Webster! Let's go!
–Move! Let's go!

38:06.737 --> 38:08.812
Stay low, keep moving!

38:09.072 --> 38:14.612
Keep moving! Fall back
to the boats now! Fall back!

38:15.703 --> 38:19.617
Jesus Christ, come on.
Blow the goddamn whistle!

38:35.138 --> 38:37.890
Okay, get into the boats!
Right now!

38:38.141 --> 38:41.510
Get in the boats, keep moving!
Come on, move!

38:41.770 --> 38:44.687
I'm gonna shoot you,
you fucking Kraut!

38:44.898 --> 38:48.942
Shoot him, we'll have to come
back for more. The boat, now!

38:49.110 --> 38:51.945
You get up, you Kraut piece of shit!

38:54.949 --> 38:58.899
Into the boats!
Quick, get in the boats! Come on!

38:59.161 --> 39:01.569
Let's go! Everyone in the boats!

39:01.831 --> 39:05.698
Let's get these boats in the water!
Start pulling!

39:14.759 --> 39:17.594
You're okay, Jackson!

39:21.808 --> 39:24.050
Keep pulling!

39:29.148 --> 39:31.983
Keep going! Come on!

39:33.110 --> 39:35.317
Come on,
Perconte, let's go!

39:35.529 --> 39:38.696
–Where's the medic?
–We're almost there.

39:38.949 --> 39:40.692
Get Jackson!

39:48.208 --> 39:51.374
Everybody off the boats!
Let's go!

39:55.006 --> 39:56.999
Get cover!

39:58.051 --> 40:01.633
Wounded! We got wounded,
come on!

40:01.888 --> 40:04.726
Get the Krauts back there,
shake them down!

40:04.807 --> 40:06.052
Move! Move!

40:06.267 --> 40:07.642
McClung! McClung!

40:07.852 --> 40:11.600
Get on to the company CP,
let them know what we got.

40:14.483 --> 40:15.728
Shut up!

40:16.652 --> 40:19.024
I can't do this! I can't do this!

40:19.196 --> 40:24.154
Webster, stay with him.
Hey, Shifty, watch Vest!

40:24.409 --> 40:28.407
–I'm going to get a medic. Got this?
–Yeah.

40:28.663 --> 40:30.786
Come on!

40:35.670 --> 40:36.868
Get his legs.

40:37.129 --> 40:42.883
Listen to me. You have to calm down
or we can't help you. Settle down.

40:43.093 --> 40:46.343
–He's gonna die!
–Jackson, don't listen to him.

40:46.513 --> 40:50.214
Look at me, you'll be fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

40:53.603 --> 40:57.471
Keep still. Be calm, buddy.
Everything's fine.

40:57.691 --> 40:59.185
Goddamn it!

40:59.359 --> 41:04.353
No! You'll jeopardize the battalion!
The battalion needs them.

41:04.656 --> 41:07.277
Stay against the wall!

41:07.742 --> 41:09.984
Watch what you're doing!

41:10.202 --> 41:13.785
We won't get more prisoners
because you killed one!

41:14.039 --> 41:16.365
–Private!
–He's gonna fucking die!

41:16.542 --> 41:18.036
Hey, sit down!

41:18.294 --> 41:20.037
The medic is coming.

41:20.295 --> 41:25.669
–Where the fuck is the medic?
–The doctor's on his way.

41:25.926 --> 41:27.301
You'll be okay.

41:27.511 --> 41:30.262
All right.
Doc's here. You're okay.

41:30.513 --> 41:35.424
All right, Jackson, take it easy.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

41:36.060 --> 41:39.394
Light. I need some light.
Give me some light.

41:40.106 --> 41:45.444
All right, look at the flame.
Look at the flame. Okay, that's good.

41:48.656 --> 41:50.482
Let's get him out of here.

41:50.658 --> 41:55.569
–Let's go. Help the doc move him.
–I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!

41:55.746 --> 41:58.830
–It's okay.
–Let's get him out of here.

41:59.082 --> 42:02.783
–Hey, take it easy.
–I don't wanna die, please help me.

42:03.044 --> 42:06.544
Hey, it's okay. It's all right.
You're all right.

42:06.798 --> 42:10.665
–Jackson?
–God! Oh, my God!

42:10.927 --> 42:15.090
Jackson, you are not gonna die.
I need you to hang on.

42:15.348 --> 42:17.340
Jackson?

42:56.220 --> 42:58.675
Eugene Jackson was 20 years old.

42:58.931 --> 43:02.798
He'd lied about his age when
he joined the Army at 16.

43:03.060 --> 43:06.594
His family got a telegram
from the War Department…

43:06.772 --> 43:11.517
saying he died a hero on a
mission that would help win the war.

43:11.693 --> 43:16.687
In fact, Eugene lost his life on a
stretcher in a basement in Haguenau…

43:16.948 --> 43:21.159
crying out in agony while his
friends looked on helplessly.

43:21.327 --> 43:26.997
He was just one more casualty in a war
that was supposed to be all but over.

43:28.709 --> 43:31.793
Did they put that
in the report on the ADA?

43:31.962 --> 43:35.717
We're working on it. How long
are you keeping the quad 50?

43:35.757 --> 43:39.292
When they want it back,
I'll hand it over.

43:45.016 --> 43:51.386
Keep moving. Go on.
Get up on the truck. Up, up.

43:52.440 --> 43:53.720
Status?

43:53.983 --> 43:58.312
Private Jackson took a grenade
frag rushing the enemy OP.

43:58.571 --> 44:03.612
–It was his own grenade.
–He died of his wounds, sir.

44:03.868 --> 44:07.532
–Any others?
–No, sir.

44:11.083 --> 44:14.534
Well executed. It's not your fault.

44:17.088 --> 44:19.295
Talk to your men.

44:20.467 --> 44:23.254
–Carry on.
–Thanks, sir.

44:47.784 --> 44:50.405
We heard you got two prisoners.

44:52.580 --> 44:54.407
Good work.

44:55.250 --> 44:57.705
Jackson's dead.

44:58.419 --> 45:00.626
Yeah, we heard.

45:02.757 --> 45:06.042
Yeah, well, they want
another patrol tonight.

45:28.990 --> 45:30.899
What are you doing, Cobb?

45:31.159 --> 45:34.195
You leave someone on the bank?

45:35.746 --> 45:38.581
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

45:38.833 --> 45:43.162
It's the third prisoner that was
too far gone to bring back.

45:43.420 --> 45:46.338
Maybe we should put
him out of his misery.

45:46.590 --> 45:51.086
–Fuck his misery.
–I can't listen to it anymore.

46:02.480 --> 46:05.564
–Sir, you want a cigarette?
–Yeah.

46:06.985 --> 46:10.685
–Who's got a light?
–Here. Hang on, sir.

46:16.368 --> 46:18.408
Twenty-two.

46:20.956 --> 46:23.827
What are you looking at, Webster?

46:27.879 --> 46:32.790
Yeah. That's what I thought,
college boy.

46:34.719 --> 46:36.593
Are you drunk, trooper?

46:36.846 --> 46:40.974
–Leave me alone.
–Answer the question.

46:41.225 --> 46:44.926
Yes, sir. I am drunk, sir.

46:45.187 --> 46:51.190
Drunk, sick and tired
of fucking patrols, taking orders—

46:51.443 --> 46:55.986
Hey, Cobb. Shut up.
It's boring, okay?

46:56.240 --> 46:59.075
Taking his side, Johnny?

47:02.245 --> 47:05.448
Yeah, I am.

47:30.439 --> 47:32.230
So he knows we lost a man?

47:32.399 --> 47:36.397
Yeah. He also knows you picked
up two prisoners who talked.

47:36.570 --> 47:42.489
–About what?
–OB, supplies, Hitler's favorite color.

47:42.659 --> 47:47.036
–None of it gets us across the river.
–What's the point?

47:49.415 --> 47:51.408
Honestly?

47:51.626 --> 47:56.620
Sink's been on the phone all day,
bragging. I think he's showing off.

47:56.797 --> 47:58.837
I don't know what to tell you.

47:59.008 --> 48:02.374
You gave him a successful patrol,
now he wants two.

48:02.511 --> 48:03.970
Successful.

48:04.137 --> 48:09.973
Sir, the men are mustered. If you
want me to brief them, I'm gonna.

48:10.685 --> 48:13.805
It's the same roster as last night.

48:14.272 --> 48:17.059
Well, mostly.

48:19.861 --> 48:22.268
–Evening, gents.
–Evening, colonel.

48:22.488 --> 48:24.362
At ease.

48:28.828 --> 48:32.279
You all did a damn fine job
on a tough mission.

48:32.456 --> 48:36.869
I wish you good luck tonight.
I'll be expecting more of the same.

48:37.044 --> 48:40.045
–Have you briefed the men?
–Just on our way.

48:40.297 --> 48:44.840
Make damn sure you remind them
how proud I am of what they did.

48:45.093 --> 48:47.086
Yes, sir.

48:51.766 --> 48:54.601
So I'll brief them now, sir?

48:56.562 --> 49:01.307
No. No, I'll do it.

49:09.908 --> 49:12.031
Sarge, they're on their way in.

49:12.286 --> 49:13.993
Ten-hut!

49:17.415 --> 49:20.250
–Martin.
–Sir.

49:20.502 --> 49:25.247
–At ease. This everybody, Grant?
–Sir.

49:29.093 --> 49:32.544
You men did an excellent job
last night.

49:33.055 --> 49:35.593
I'm proud.

49:36.350 --> 49:38.592
Colonel Sink is proud too.

49:38.769 --> 49:42.767
He's so proud he wants you
to do another patrol tonight.

49:47.444 --> 49:51.109
The outpost we hit last night
will go up in flames.

49:51.323 --> 49:52.577
–Martin?
–Yes, sir.

49:52.741 --> 49:57.153
We'd have to venture farther into town.
Captain Speirs, the map.

49:57.370 --> 49:59.861
Yeah. Sergeant Grant?

50:03.292 --> 50:06.329
We have enemy movement here and here.

50:06.587 --> 50:09.707
Which means this is our
new house target here.

50:09.882 --> 50:13.880
We recovered the boats.
We'll set off from the same place.

50:14.053 --> 50:16.970
We're not changing the plan any, sir?

50:19.141 --> 50:21.976
No. The plan is the same.

50:24.062 --> 50:28.012
It will be 0200 hours instead of 0100.

50:28.274 --> 50:31.394
–Is that clear?
–Yes, sir.

50:31.653 --> 50:38.154
Okay. Good. Because I want you all
to get a full night's sleep tonight.

50:40.411 --> 50:45.238
In the morning, you will report
that you made it across the river…

50:45.499 --> 50:47.824
into German lines…

50:48.961 --> 50:52.626
but were unable
to secure any live prisoners.

50:59.012 --> 51:03.056
–Understand?
–Yes, sir.

51:06.269 --> 51:08.226
Good.

51:08.396 --> 51:13.686
Look sharp for tomorrow.
We're moving off the line.

51:15.653 --> 51:17.941
Did I fucking hear that right?

51:19.823 --> 51:23.073
Moving off the line!

51:32.919 --> 51:35.161
It's a new way to fight a war.

51:35.338 --> 51:40.000
Don't bother writing this up.
I'll take care of it. I might enjoy it.

51:40.176 --> 51:42.881
I think you might be onto something—

51:45.097 --> 51:46.841
Lieutenant Jones.

51:47.099 --> 51:49.341
–Sir.
–Join us at the company CP.

52:01.321 --> 52:03.397
–First Sergeant Lipton?
–Sir.

52:03.573 --> 52:06.527
Your honorable discharge
as an enlisted man…

52:06.701 --> 52:08.246
Just keep them coming, Luz.

52:08.286 --> 52:12.533
and your battlefield commission
as a second lieutenant.

52:12.707 --> 52:14.664
–Congratulations.
–Thank you.

52:14.917 --> 52:18.120
–Lip, congratulations.
–Thanks.

52:19.171 --> 52:21.378
Thank you. Welcome back, sir.

52:21.549 --> 52:26.045
–Hey, that's Harry to you.
–I didn't expect to see you this soon.

52:26.303 --> 52:31.463
–I figured you'd be nursing that scratch.
–Did you miss me, Lewis?

52:32.392 --> 52:37.138
Lt Jones. Regiment has seen fit
to promote you to first lieutenant.

52:37.397 --> 52:39.805
They want you on staff up there.

52:40.025 --> 52:42.101
Don't go far with that.

52:45.530 --> 52:50.441
–Congratulations and good luck.
–Thank you, sir.

52:51.661 --> 52:53.986
Dismissed.

52:54.955 --> 52:58.159
I guess you lost
another platoon leader, Web?

53:03.672 --> 53:05.878
A second patrol never happened.

53:06.049 --> 53:10.925
Word was Captain Nixon wrote up a
bogus report. Regiment never got wise.

53:11.096 --> 53:13.966
As we pulled out of Haguenau,
many of us…

53:14.140 --> 53:20.095
felt that a corner had been turned
and we all might make it home alive.

53:20.355 --> 53:22.810
We'll know more closer to the line.

53:23.066 --> 53:29.649
Oh, before I forget.
Col. Sink's unhappy with your uniform.

53:29.864 --> 53:33.197
He says it's not befitting
to your rank.

53:39.540 --> 53:41.532
Oak leaves.

53:43.085 --> 53:45.492
Congratulations, major.

53:47.839 --> 53:49.666
Gentlemen, we're ready.

53:58.599 --> 54:00.508
I'll drive.

54:01.435 --> 54:03.843
–Sergeant Malarkey.
–Good luck, sir.

54:07.608 --> 54:10.146
–Sergeant Martin.
–Yeah, lieutenant?

54:10.319 --> 54:13.273
–Good work.
–Thanks. Good to have you along.

54:39.054 --> 54:40.549
Here.

54:55.695 --> 55:00.736
I wondered if people would know what
it cost the soldiers to win this war.

55:00.909 --> 55:04.497
In America, things were
already looking like peacetime.

55:04.537 --> 55:08.866
The standard of living was on the rise,
nightclubs were booming.

55:09.041 --> 55:13.502
You couldn't get a hotel room
in Miami Beach, it was so crowded.

55:15.214 --> 55:20.552
Could anyone know the price paid by
soldiers in terror, agony and bloodshed…

55:20.719 --> 55:27.255
if they'd never been to places like
Normandy, Bastogne or Haguenau?

09:00:00.000 --> 09:00:01.000
