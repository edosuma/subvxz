00:01.250 --> 00:02.490
<i>Previously on The Shield.</i>

00:02.610 --> 00:05.530
Detective Terry Crowley.
Remember him?

00:05.650 --> 00:07.570
<i>Two and a half years ago,
he was on your Strike Team.</i>

00:07.650 --> 00:09.890
<i>He was undercover.
Part of a federal investigation.</i>

00:10.010 --> 00:12.090
<i>He was your teammate.
He was a threat.</i>

00:12.170 --> 00:14.850
<i>So he had to die.</i>

00:14.970 --> 00:17.570
We killed a cop.

00:17.690 --> 00:20.450
Get over it
and don't bring it up again.

00:20.570 --> 00:24.610
You didn't know, did you?
Vic never told you.

00:24.730 --> 00:28.930
- Vic did not kill Terry.
- So prove it. Wear a wire.

00:29.050 --> 00:32.250
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, man. We need to talk.</i>

00:32.330 --> 00:34.210
Don't you lie to me.
Don't lie to me.

00:34.290 --> 00:35.890
- What are you doin'? Stop!
- [Radio Static]

00:35.970 --> 00:38.370
- I need sound.
- I.A.D. Has me wired, all right?

00:38.490 --> 00:40.730
<i>- What?
- I just disconnected it.
They're watching us right now.</i>

00:40.810 --> 00:44.850
They busted me with some heroin,
and they're talking prison if I don't do this.

00:44.930 --> 00:47.450
- Why is it even a question?
- Because I think you're lying to me.

00:47.530 --> 00:50.050
You look me in the eye
and tell me the truth about Terry.

00:50.170 --> 00:54.610
- Don't buy into their bullshit.
- Then you look me in the eye,
you tell me the truth.

00:55.610 --> 00:57.410
Oh, my God.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.250
<i>[Kavanaugh]
What happened to your mike last night?</i>

01:01.370 --> 01:03.450
It got disconnected
in the fight.

01:03.570 --> 01:06.770
<i>- How much you get?
- Nothing-after you two started to mix it up.</i>

01:06.850 --> 01:09.330
<i>You want to fill me in?</i>

01:09.410 --> 01:13.650
Yeah. Well, I asked him about Terry, and he
still says it was the drug dealer who shot him.

01:13.730 --> 01:15.610
How'd it get physical
with Vic?

01:15.690 --> 01:18.170
<i>Guys like him, they just don't come out
and tell you shit.</i>

01:18.250 --> 01:21.810
<i>I had to make it personal
to get the truth.</i>

01:21.890 --> 01:24.370
<i>I can't believe I was stupid enough
to let you in my head.</i>

01:24.450 --> 01:27.570
<i>Make me think Vic had something to do
with Terry dying.</i>

01:31.050 --> 01:35.010
<i>- Lift up your shirt.
- Nah. You know what?</i>

01:35.130 --> 01:36.770
- I'm done with that.
- Done?

01:36.890 --> 01:39.410
<i>Let's just put a pin
in Terry for a minute, okay?</i>

01:39.490 --> 01:42.650
I still need to get a sense
of what your team's into.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.890
<i>And I got a 15-year sentence
hanging over your head.</i>

01:44.970 --> 01:48.770
So, please.
Lift up your shirt.

01:52.690 --> 01:55.570
And let's avoid any technical
malfunctions this time. All right?

01:55.650 --> 01:56.770
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:56.890 --> 01:58.490
<i>- All right? Okay.
- Got you.</i>

02:01.090 --> 02:02.890
<i>Hold on, buddy. Yeah?</i>

02:03.010 --> 02:04.770
Hey, what is it?

02:04.890 --> 02:07.410
- When we're alone, man.
- Baby?

02:07.490 --> 02:09.330
<i>- Yeah?
- Can you take him?</i>

02:09.410 --> 02:11.410
<i>- Hey, guys.
- There she is. Here's Mama.</i>

02:11.490 --> 02:13.890
<i>- Come here, cutie.
- Gonna be just a second.</i>

02:14.010 --> 02:16.290
- Okay.
- I love you.

02:16.410 --> 02:18.770
Yeah? What's up?

02:18.850 --> 02:21.330
Lem got picked up
by I.A.D.

02:21.410 --> 02:23.450
- For what?
- They nabbed him for heroin.

02:23.570 --> 02:26.610
Heroin?
We haven't busted any heroin in a while.

02:26.690 --> 02:30.290
What's Lem doing with horse? He's not using.
He's running something on the side?

02:30.370 --> 02:32.090
He wouldn't do anything
without telling us.

02:32.210 --> 02:34.370
What, like burn
the money train cash?

02:34.490 --> 02:36.890
I.A.D.'s got him
wearing a wire.

02:38.410 --> 02:40.410
So they're
coming after us.

02:40.490 --> 02:43.330
<i>We planted a gun on Doomsday
and dropped him off in Mexico yesterday.</i>

02:43.450 --> 02:46.370
Lem wasn't even there. He was covering us
the whole time, we didn't have a clue.

02:46.490 --> 02:49.410
- What do you think they're looking at us for?
- How long has this been going on?

02:49.530 --> 02:51.890
I don't know. But right now we gotta
stay focused on Lem.

02:51.970 --> 02:54.930
Figure out exactly what they've got on him
and how to get him out of it.

02:55.010 --> 02:56.930
How we gonna do that
if he's wired?

02:58.730 --> 03:02.810
Grab your laptop, sweep the clubhouse
for bugs and meet us there in a few.

03:02.930 --> 03:05.850
Hey. Let's keep
our regular routine.

03:05.930 --> 03:09.170
I.A.D. Gets a whiff that Lem
tipped us, it's over for him.

03:16.690 --> 03:19.050
Lem asked me about
Terry last night.

03:19.170 --> 03:22.050
- On tape?
- He pulled the mike out first.

03:22.170 --> 03:24.730
- Well, what did you tell him?
- Nothing.

03:24.850 --> 03:26.610
But he knows.

03:29.490 --> 03:32.410
So what are
we gonna do?

03:32.490 --> 03:35.050
Lem needs help right now.
We just got to back him up.

03:35.170 --> 03:37.410
We'll explain everything to him
once he's out of trouble.

03:37.530 --> 03:41.330
First downtown ask us for our records on Terry,
now Lem. You think he told 'em somethin'?

03:41.410 --> 03:43.890
- He's got nothing to tell.
- But that's what I.A.D.'s coming after us for.

03:43.970 --> 03:47.810
You and I were the only two people in that
room. Nothing that Lem or I.A.D. Can do...

03:47.930 --> 03:49.810
can ever change that simple fact.

03:51.490 --> 03:53.490
Just gotta stick together.

03:53.570 --> 03:57.850
First one in.
Came to put the java on, when I found 'em.

03:57.970 --> 04:01.330
- What time was that?
- Let the detectives handle the interviews.

04:01.410 --> 04:03.610
We just need to preserve
the crime scene.

04:08.130 --> 04:12.330
<i>What do you think? Heart attack,
then she got crushed underneath him?</i>

04:12.450 --> 04:14.770
<i>Talk about
coitus interruptus.</i>

04:15.970 --> 04:17.690
<i>What?</i>

04:17.769 --> 04:19.970
<i>- [Whimpers]
- [Tina Gasps]</i>

04:20.089 --> 04:22.370
<i>- She's alive.
- [Tina] Jesus.</i>

04:22.490 --> 04:24.330
Give me a hand.
[Grunts]

04:25.490 --> 04:27.890
<i>- Jesus.
- She looked dead.</i>

04:27.970 --> 04:30.130
[Whimpers]

04:31.690 --> 04:33.890
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

04:34.010 --> 04:35.930
[Mouthing Words]

04:36.010 --> 04:38.370
<i>- You got no sense ofhumor, asshole.
- It's just not that funny.</i>

04:38.450 --> 04:40.290
- It's not that funny.
- Tell me this isn't, uh-

04:40.410 --> 04:42.450
<i>- Oh, for God's sake.
- Isn't hysterical.</i>

04:42.530 --> 04:44.370
<i>- Don't tell it again.
- What?</i>

04:44.450 --> 04:47.130
You got three explorers
in the Congo, right?

04:47.250 --> 04:49.090
They get captured by natives.

04:49.210 --> 04:52.370
<i>Natives tie up the three whiteys.
They bind and gag 'em, right?</i>

04:52.450 --> 04:55.570
Chief walks up to the first explorer
and he says, uh...

04:55.650 --> 04:59.410
<i>"You have two choices.
You can choose death or chi-chi. "</i>

04:59.490 --> 05:01.410
<i>- [Curtis] Okay.
- First explorer didn't want to die, right?</i>

05:01.530 --> 05:05.330
He says, "I'll take chi-chi." Twelve men
grab him, rape him, sodomize him for hours.

05:05.410 --> 05:07.850
<i>Cut offhis dick and his balls,
shove it into his mouth...</i>

05:07.970 --> 05:10.850
<i>send him into the woods
bleeding from every hole.</i>

05:10.970 --> 05:15.090
The, uh-The chief walks up to
the second explorer, and he says, uh, uh...

05:15.170 --> 05:18.050
"You have two choices.
You can choose death or chi-chi."

05:18.170 --> 05:21.090
<i>The second explorer
debates in his head.</i>

05:21.210 --> 05:23.090
<i>He doesn't want to die.
He says, "I'll take chi-chi."</i>

05:23.170 --> 05:26.210
<i>Eighteen tribesmen grab him,
rape, sodomize him for hours...</i>

05:26.330 --> 05:28.530
cut off his dick and his balls,
shove it into his mouth...

05:28.610 --> 05:31.930
send him into the woods
bleeding from every hole.

05:32.050 --> 05:34.930
<i>The chief goes up
to the last explorer, right?</i>

05:35.010 --> 05:37.330
<i>And he says, uh,
"You have two choices.</i>

05:37.410 --> 05:40.530
<i>You must choose death
or chi-chi. "</i>

05:41.930 --> 05:43.770
<i>- [Mackey] Yeah?
- Um, third explorer...</i>

05:43.850 --> 05:46.610
big macho guy, mustache,
looks at him and says, uh...

05:46.690 --> 05:49.090
<i>"I'll choose death."</i>

05:49.170 --> 05:53.970
<i>The chief turns to his entire
tribe of 100 natives and says...</i>

05:54.050 --> 05:57.650
"Very well then. Death by chi-chi."

05:57.730 --> 06:00.890
<i>- [Laughter]
- Geez.</i>

06:00.970 --> 06:03.330
<i>- See, I told you it was funny.
- [Ronnie] It's not funny.</i>

06:03.410 --> 06:05.050
<i>- It's disgusting.
- [Knocking]
- [Door HandleJiggling]</i>

06:05.170 --> 06:06.770
<i>[Danny]
Hey, guys, it's locked.</i>

06:06.850 --> 06:08.850
<i>[Shane]
Hold on.</i>

06:08.930 --> 06:10.770
<i>Sorry about that.
We didn't know it was locked.</i>

06:10.850 --> 06:13.170
You got a dead body.
Possible sex crime.

06:13.250 --> 06:15.250
Can you give that to somebody
whose time isn't as valuable?

06:15.330 --> 06:17.090
We've got a million balls
in the air right now.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.810
Yeah, well,
welcome to my world, hon.

06:18.890 --> 06:22.210
Hey, boys. What do you say
we clean up a D.B. By lunchtime?

06:22.290 --> 06:24.890
<i>- All right, man.
- You okay?</i>

06:24.970 --> 06:27.170
Uh, yeah,
he just kicked.

06:27.290 --> 06:30.050
<i>He? It's a boy.
Congrats.</i>

06:30.170 --> 06:33.490
<i>- Thanks. Yeah, I just found out.
- Congratulations.</i>

06:38.370 --> 06:40.210
I'll get the car.

06:41.930 --> 06:44.890
Find out everything we can about
this Kavanaugh guy sweatin' Lem.

06:45.010 --> 06:47.170
Yeah, what about the heroin
they got him on?

06:47.290 --> 06:49.090
Could be chum
to set us in motion.

06:49.210 --> 06:51.770
No, let's get a bead on this guy
before we take his bait.

06:51.890 --> 06:54.290
Okay.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.450
<i>[Julien] We found him on top
of an unknown female.</i>

06:56.570 --> 06:59.330
Arms were bound.
We found keys on the table.

06:59.450 --> 07:01.370
<i>Guy's got a truck outside.
He let himself in.</i>

07:01.490 --> 07:03.890
<i>Poppers.
Intensifies the orgasm.</i>

07:05.090 --> 07:07.650
Guess he popped more
than he bargained for.

07:07.770 --> 07:09.690
Run it.

07:09.810 --> 07:12.090
The shop owner called it in.

07:12.170 --> 07:14.970
<i>- [Mackey] You know this guy?
- Never seen him before.</i>

07:15.050 --> 07:17.530
Really? Then why does he have keys
to your place?

07:21.370 --> 07:25.690
It's a teamster shop.
Hey, Shane, call the local 629.

07:25.810 --> 07:28.730
Tell 'em Rick here is taking
hard-earned cash out of their pockets...

07:28.850 --> 07:30.970
and feeding it
to the nonunion wetbacks.

07:32.690 --> 07:36.210
Rodrigo's a part-time driver.
He never made trouble before.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.450
The union wages
are killing my bottom line.

07:38.530 --> 07:41.010
I see the scabs
are working out nicely for you.

07:41.090 --> 07:44.090
- Where's his rig parked?
- Over there.

07:45.490 --> 07:48.850
You know what?
Check the cab for a purse. We need an I.D.

07:56.490 --> 07:59.330
Check 'em.

08:04.210 --> 08:07.170
- Dude, no drugs, no candy.
- Nothin' in the cab.

08:10.050 --> 08:11.970
<i>Goddamn itl</i>

08:12.090 --> 08:14.410
Hey, guys?

08:14.530 --> 08:16.850
<i>- Let me see that crowbar.
- Here, man.</i>

08:18.610 --> 08:20.450
Here we go.

08:21.570 --> 08:23.450
Watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out.

08:23.530 --> 08:25.050
[Grunts]

08:27.690 --> 08:29.490
- [Curtis] Shit.
- Aw, Geez.

08:29.570 --> 08:31.650
<i>- Get this off!
- Watch out!</i>

08:33.130 --> 08:34.770
<i>[Mackey]
Come on. Let's go.</i>

08:37.090 --> 08:38.890
They gone?

08:39.890 --> 08:42.130
Yeah.
All three of them.

08:42.210 --> 08:44.850
<i>##[Rock]</i>

08:44.930 --> 08:47.890
<i>[Men, Women Chattering]</i>

08:47.970 --> 08:50.770
<i>##[Ends]</i>

08:54.450 --> 08:57.650
The guy covered up the air vents
with electric tape to keep 'em quiet.

08:57.730 --> 08:59.410
Shithead
suffocated them all.

08:59.490 --> 09:00.930
No I.D.'s on any of'em.

09:01.050 --> 09:03.930
<i>Rodrigo did a nickel in Chino
for assault and rape a few years back.</i>

09:04.050 --> 09:06.490
<i>And you saw
the Los Perdidos ink.</i>

09:06.570 --> 09:09.050
They must have expanded
from drugs to skin trafficking.

09:09.170 --> 09:12.050
Address on the license is old,
but his P.O. Gave me a new one.

09:14.290 --> 09:17.890
Why don't we file for a warrant?
Gotta check out his crib, see what's there.

09:18.010 --> 09:21.490
Lem and I will hit Mission Cross,
see what we can get from the victim.

09:23.450 --> 09:28.130
- How she doing?
- She's sedated and severely
dehydrated, but she'll live.

09:28.250 --> 09:31.570
- Any signs of sexual assault?
- There's multiple tears. It's pretty bad.

09:31.690 --> 09:35.290
Tox report shows
Rohypnol in her blood.

09:35.410 --> 09:37.210
- She give you a name?
- Magdalena.

09:37.290 --> 09:42.530
Says that a "federale" in Mexico sold her and
her little brother to Mexican gangbangers.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.570
<i>She's not too big on cops.</i>

09:45.690 --> 09:47.650
I told her you were two
of the good guys.

09:49.930 --> 09:53.570
<i>[Mackey] We found three girls
in the truck. We didn't find your brother.</i>

09:53.690 --> 09:55.330
It's okay to talk to them.

09:58.170 --> 10:01.250
They drop him off
just before we stop.

10:01.370 --> 10:04.130
<i>I heard a man take him.</i>

10:04.250 --> 10:07.250
<i>About 10 minutes later,
we stopped again.</i>

10:07.330 --> 10:11.530
That's when the driver
took me inside.

10:11.650 --> 10:13.890
Forced me.

10:14.010 --> 10:17.810
Then he just died.

10:20.170 --> 10:22.530
Is there anything you can tell us
about the men who sold you?

10:22.610 --> 10:24.450
<i>Or who you were
supposed to go to?</i>

10:24.530 --> 10:26.970
They tell us nothing.

<i>Please find him.</i>

We're gonna do

11:05.890 --> 11:08.570
<i>[Danny] Excuse me, Detectives.
I have an attorney here for you.</i>

11:08.650 --> 11:11.810
I'm Becca Doyle.
You arrested my client, Evan Dayne...

11:11.930 --> 11:14.290
for the cafeteria shooting
during the school riot.

11:14.410 --> 11:17.690
<i>- Evan? Calls himself Every-Day?
- How'd that come to your attention, counselor?</i>

11:17.770 --> 11:20.450
<i>I represented him two years ago
when he was guilty.</i>

11:20.570 --> 11:23.450
This time he's innocent, so I
offered my services pro bono.

11:23.530 --> 11:26.490
What makes you think
this guy's innocent?

11:26.610 --> 11:29.090
Is there someplace
we can talk?

11:29.210 --> 11:31.810
Several eyewitnesses
I.D.'d your boy.

11:31.930 --> 11:33.730
I reinterviewed your witnesses.

11:33.850 --> 11:36.210
Sorry to say,
pretty shoddy work.

11:36.290 --> 11:40.250
[Scoffs] Mariano gave us Evan,
four others confirmed it.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.770
There all Mariano's close friends.
Did you know that?

11:42.850 --> 11:46.010
We're not gonna reopen this case
based on who's in what clique.

11:46.090 --> 11:49.170
Mariano gave you a patsy,
and his buddies backed him up.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.410
<i>You didn't look into your original witness
very hard, did you?</i>

11:52.490 --> 11:54.650
Evan has a history
of weapons and assault.

11:54.770 --> 11:56.570
And he's cleaned
himself up since.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.490
He's stayed away
from guns and gangs.

11:58.570 --> 12:01.090
I've checked in with him
every few months for the past two years.

12:01.210 --> 12:03.330
We do our
own investigations.

12:03.450 --> 12:08.290
Look. We all have tough jobs,
and we all make mistakes.

12:08.410 --> 12:11.610
Mine's having a little too much faith
in my clients sometimes.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.610
But this time
my faith is justified.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.210
We'll look into it.

12:20.290 --> 12:22.010
Thank you.
I'll wait.

12:23.650 --> 12:27.570
<i>Yeah, all right.
We'll hit you up, bud. Yep.</i>

12:27.650 --> 12:29.890
<i>Coroner says Rodrigo died
of a heart attack.</i>

12:30.010 --> 12:32.570
Mixed too much party fuel.
Shane and Ronnie got the warrant.

12:32.690 --> 12:35.650
<i>Call 'em back. Tell 'em we'll meet 'em there.
I'll see you at the car.</i>

12:38.090 --> 12:41.210
Has anyone from the department come around
asking any questions?

12:41.330 --> 12:43.330
What are you talking about?

12:43.450 --> 12:45.730
Ah, there's a rumor flying around
that someone might be trying...

12:45.850 --> 12:48.090
to make political hay
by coming after my team.

12:48.210 --> 12:49.810
Could be I.A.D.

12:49.890 --> 12:52.090
- And this is just a rumor?
- No, we're clean.

12:52.210 --> 12:54.370
But they might come
poking around asking questions.

12:54.490 --> 12:56.810
Look, the fact is that you
and I were married...

12:56.930 --> 12:59.610
so spousal privilege
applies to that entire time.

12:59.730 --> 13:02.650
- So you don't have to tell anyone anything.
- What do I say if they ask?

13:02.730 --> 13:05.370
Just tell 'em nothing.
Call me.

13:05.450 --> 13:09.090
- What?
- Is there something that
I need to hide from them?

13:09.210 --> 13:11.610
Of course not.

13:11.730 --> 13:13.890
Listen, thanks
for the help with Magdalena.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.090
- Rodrigo's place.
- Something wrong?

13:20.170 --> 13:23.650
- No, I'm fine.
- Come on, ladies. It's playtime.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.690
<i>- Police!
- ##[Speakers: Spanish Rap]</i>

13:26.930 --> 13:28.770
All right.
He's gone.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.370
- [Curtis] Clear.
- Tear it up.

13:30.490 --> 13:31.610
Yep.

13:35.930 --> 13:38.330
- ## [Stops]

13:48.970 --> 13:50.690

13:52.610 --> 13:54.490
No, it can't be that easy.

13:54.570 --> 13:57.690
He's an ex-con from Mexico.
It damn well could be.

13:59.690 --> 14:01.530
Ho.

14:01.610 --> 14:03.650
<i>Rip that open.</i>

14:04.770 --> 14:06.650
<i>Jackpot.
Let me see that.</i>

Picture of girls, a few boys.

14:13.650 --> 14:15.810
Hey, it's Magdalena.

14:18.170 --> 14:20.170
The other three girls
in the truck.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.610
That accounts for four of them.
What about the rest of these kids?

14:22.690 --> 14:26.130
<i>- Where are they?
- Hey, Magdalena's brother.</i>

14:26.210 --> 14:29.330
- [Ronnie] Names, prices-
- And a passenger manifest.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.210
<i>- [Mackey] It's a goddamn kiddie catalog.
- Hey.</i>

14:32.290 --> 14:35.770
What's granny
doing in here?

14:35.850 --> 14:39.250
Either someone's into dry pussy
or she's helping traffic these kids.

14:39.330 --> 14:41.730
Fifth and Alvarado.
Let's go.

14:41.890 --> 14:43.930
I just checked
with my witnesses.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.930
<i>Those kids are contradicting
everything they told you.</i>

14:46.050 --> 14:49.170
<i>They still say Mariano's innocent
and Every-Day did do the shooting.</i>

14:49.250 --> 14:51.290
Maybe it's time
to reexamine your faith.

14:51.410 --> 14:53.730
Mariano must have scared his friends
to keep their mouth shut.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.450
We're trying to get
at the bottom of this.

14:55.530 --> 14:57.890
You don't know anybody who would be
willing to give up Mariano?

14:57.970 --> 15:00.010
If he did, I would have
given it to you already.

15:00.130 --> 15:02.490
Look, Mariano's a bad dude.
Besides, it was a riot.

15:02.570 --> 15:06.330
We were all runnin'- Maybe I was
the only one that seen him pull the gun?

15:06.410 --> 15:10.170
So, right now, it's still his word
against five others, right?

15:11.210 --> 15:13.090
No one said
this would be easy...

15:13.210 --> 15:15.490
but someone will
tell the truth eventually.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.570
Or maybe it's just
a play on your part?

15:17.690 --> 15:22.010
You get us to reopen the case, that creates
the reasonable doubt you need to go to trial.

15:22.090 --> 15:26.210
He's facing 12 to 25.
All I'm asking is we be sure.

15:28.610 --> 15:30.770
Why are you still
playing along with her?

15:30.850 --> 15:34.210
You know witness statements.
They go down quick. Maybe we got taken.

15:34.330 --> 15:36.850
<i>- No, this is about something else.
- No, it isn't.</i>

15:36.930 --> 15:39.410
You're pissed I called you out
about dragging your feet.

15:39.490 --> 15:41.650
Now you're undermining a case
I pushed for.

15:41.730 --> 15:43.770
<i>Excuse me, Detectives.
I'm really shorthanded.</i>

15:43.890 --> 15:46.610
- Is one of you free?
- Dutch is.

15:46.690 --> 15:50.650
Dutch, this is, uh, Parole Officer
Marshall Traynor. He's got a case.

15:50.770 --> 15:53.170
I think it's pretty much
right up your alley.

15:55.130 --> 15:57.930
<i>Loel missed his court date the other day,
violated his parole.</i>

15:58.050 --> 16:00.210
Means he goes back
for another two years.

16:00.290 --> 16:02.970
My friend Ned just did a stretch
for armed robbery.

16:03.050 --> 16:06.850
Some dude was taking care of his dog,
and Ned asked me to drive him to pick it up.

16:06.970 --> 16:10.970
The dude wouldn't give it back,
so we go to this guy's place.

16:11.090 --> 16:13.970
<i>- [Traynor] A trailer.
- Where?</i>

16:14.050 --> 16:16.450
Somewhere around here.
He doesn't remember.

16:16.530 --> 16:20.330
<i>So I'm sitting in the truck, and all of a sudden,
Ned comes out all bloody and shit.</i>

16:20.450 --> 16:23.330
Tells me the guy
wouldn't give him back the dog.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.330
They fought, and Ned did him
in the head with a shotgun.

16:26.410 --> 16:29.050
So you, uh, just decided to hang
around and violate your parole?

16:29.170 --> 16:32.570
Ned had the gun! He made me
grab the dead body, hack the head off...

16:32.650 --> 16:36.570
buried it in a field
and then chopped up the body.

16:36.650 --> 16:38.530
<i>What did you do
with the body parts?</i>

16:38.610 --> 16:42.610
There's this junkyard with,
like, a half a dozen guard dogs.

16:47.170 --> 16:49.570
I was an unwilling
participant, okay?

16:49.690 --> 16:53.090
- Do you buy his story?
- I believe he's telling the truth.

16:53.210 --> 16:54.970
Because you've dealt
with him a lot?

16:55.050 --> 16:58.330
<i>'Cause his brows were raised,
his lips parted and stretched.</i>

16:58.410 --> 17:00.250
I've studied up
on reading faces.

17:00.330 --> 17:02.210
Gotten pretty good at it.

17:02.330 --> 17:05.650
I've read up on micro-expression
facial action units.

17:05.770 --> 17:08.609
'Cause it's fascinating stuff.
The results are disputed.

17:08.730 --> 17:11.010
Proof's in the pudding.

17:11.089 --> 17:13.970
<i>So can you spare some time
and help me find...</i>

17:14.050 --> 17:16.050
this headless pile
of dog food?

17:16.130 --> 17:19.569
Yeah. Um, first though-

17:19.650 --> 17:21.490
What do you think
of this kid?

17:21.569 --> 17:23.970

You sure you're not wasting our time?

17:24.089 --> 17:27.609
<i>[Every-Day] Lady, I don't have a lot

17:27.690 --> 17:30.170
But I ain't never
shot no one.

18:44.530 --> 18:47.130

I always get a kick out of that one.
They just got it wrong, right?

19:04.610 --> 19:06.650
<i>It's "kee-kee,"
not chi-chi.</i>

19:06.730 --> 19:09.650

<i>You're still making the same mistakes

19:23.530 --> 19:25.370
And what is that?

19:25.450 --> 19:29.730
I used to think that Mackey was the luckiest
son of a bitch alive-

19:29.850 --> 19:32.610
how things just fell
into place for him.

19:32.690 --> 19:36.930
And then I realized he was
creating his own luck.

19:38.490 --> 19:42.010
So what you see as a simple
microphone malfunction...

19:42.130 --> 19:45.010
I see as calculated.

19:46.450 --> 19:48.690
The worst animal
in the joint...

19:48.770 --> 19:50.770
98% of the time...

19:50.850 --> 19:53.050
he's just like anybody else.

19:54.650 --> 19:56.770
Anybody.

19:56.890 --> 20:01.250
It's the other two percent
that lands him where he is.

20:01.370 --> 20:04.530
And I'm going
to know everything...

20:04.610 --> 20:06.610
everything,
about Vic Mackey.

20:06.690 --> 20:09.490
And when he goes into
the two percent zone...

20:09.570 --> 20:11.450
I got him.

20:11.530 --> 20:14.170
<i>You still don't know
who you're dealing with.</i>

20:14.250 --> 20:18.530
Or maybe you're still too convinced
that he's evil 100% of the time.

20:18.610 --> 20:21.970
<i>And that's why you keep
grabbing for air...</i>

20:22.050 --> 20:26.490
and he keeps slippin' away.

20:26.570 --> 20:30.210
You've never looked Mackey in the eye,
had him lie straight to your face...

20:30.330 --> 20:34.330
and made you doubt yourself even though
you know he was full of shit.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.810
So until you do...

20:36.930 --> 20:40.450
this is all just
a waste of time.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.690
I am so surprised

20:45.770 --> 20:47.930
Yeah, you knew

20:49.170 --> 20:51.490
Well, Terry was your guy,

in Chowchilla for murder
30 years ago.

22:20.570 --> 22:23.130

<i>Man, there goes eight hours before we can

22:26.530 --> 22:29.370
Jesus. Call the

- See if they can get a lawyer here sooner.
- Right, man.

22:33.530 --> 22:36.050
Got a minute?
It's Doyle, right?

22:36.130 --> 22:38.690
- I'm working a case now.
- That's funny, so am I.

22:38.810 --> 22:42.050
I got a little old lady right in the middle
of a sex-trafficking ring.

22:42.170 --> 22:44.410
Uh, she needs a lawyer.

22:44.490 --> 22:47.570
I'm sure the public defenders' office
will send a capable candidate right over.

22:47.650 --> 22:51.130
I can't wait. I still got almost 50
Mexican sex slaves in play.

22:51.210 --> 22:53.930
And once word hits the street that
Grandma and Jethro got busted...

22:54.050 --> 22:56.290
whole operation
goes underground.

22:56.410 --> 22:59.410
They cover their tracks.
How'd you like to do a good deed for today?

22:59.490 --> 23:01.330
Already have.

23:01.410 --> 23:05.370
And I seem to remember you have a talent for
shading things on the witness stand, Detective.

23:05.450 --> 23:07.290
I think you'll be fine.

23:07.370 --> 23:09.210
You're still upset
about the Crawford case?

23:09.290 --> 23:10.850
The jury felt
that that guy was guilty.

23:10.970 --> 23:13.890
- You can't hold that against me.
- The case rested solely on your testimony.

23:14.010 --> 23:16.650
Which was completely
on the level.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.770
Sorry, I have my hands full.

23:19.890 --> 23:22.930
So you'd rather hold a grudge than help make
a case that could save lives.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.730
Actually, it's about picking
and choosing my clients.

23:27.810 --> 23:31.730
As appealing as your offer sounds, I'd rather
not devote the next month of my life...

23:31.810 --> 23:33.690
to protecting a sex slave-master
grandmother.

23:33.770 --> 23:35.890
All I'm asking is an hour.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.570
[Speaking Spanish]

23:42.690 --> 23:44.810
[Spanish]

23:49.090 --> 23:51.490
They bring other girls to the fruit stand
a few at a time.

23:51.610 --> 23:53.810
Her job is to take 'em
to the drop-off point.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.050
<i>- ¿Dónde?
- [Spanish]</i>

23:57.570 --> 24:00.930
Different places.
A place where there's a lot of kids around.

24:01.050 --> 24:05.490
A bunch of teenage kids with a little old lady
like yourself doesn't raise eyebrows.

24:05.570 --> 24:08.650
<i>- Who's the contact?
- [Tina Speaking Spanish]</i>

24:08.770 --> 24:11.570
[Spanish]

24:11.650 --> 24:14.170
<i>It always changes.
He finds her after she makes the call.</i>

24:14.250 --> 24:17.890
<i>- We gotta set up a meet.
- [Rebecca] That's not part of the deal.</i>

24:18.010 --> 24:20.130
I have to send one
of my people to the meet.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.770
Then we follow the contact
and bust up the whole operation.

24:22.850 --> 24:24.570
If you want her
doing fieldwork...

24:24.690 --> 24:27.250
<i>which wasn't in the deal,
then I need probation.</i>

24:27.330 --> 24:29.330
<i>- Dream on.
- If everything hinges on her...</i>

24:29.410 --> 24:31.250
<i>I'd be a fool
to give up that hammer.</i>

24:31.330 --> 24:33.210
Just like you were foolish
for letting me know...

24:33.290 --> 24:35.650
how important she is
to making your case.

24:37.570 --> 24:39.490
<i>Come here.</i>

24:41.730 --> 24:43.530
You'd set her free?

24:43.650 --> 24:45.770
No. You will.

24:45.890 --> 24:48.090
And maybe next time,
you won't make that mistake.

24:48.170 --> 24:50.970
Right now,
it's the only deal to be made.

24:55.010 --> 24:56.890
We're gonna be
able to hear every word you say.

24:56.970 --> 24:58.850
You're gonna be in our
sight lines at all time.

24:58.970 --> 25:01.370
- Questions?
- No, I'm good.

25:01.490 --> 25:04.050
Officer Lowe has some misgivings
about putting his trainee under.

25:04.130 --> 25:07.130
<i>- She's still on probation.
- [Mackey] A decoy is supposed to look young.</i>

25:07.210 --> 25:10.130
Wide-eyed and new to the game works
for us. The only thing I don't want...

25:10.210 --> 25:12.450
<i>is the bad guys getting
even one whiff of cop off ofher.</i>

25:12.570 --> 25:15.250
- Could jeopardize the whole takedown.
- What about you, honey?

25:15.330 --> 25:18.370
- You think you can handle this?
- They got me covered. I don't see a problem.

25:18.490 --> 25:22.970
<i>Then let's do this thing.
Julien, you're in charge of uni backup.</i>

25:23.090 --> 25:25.250
- Appreciate the support.
- You heard my reasons.

25:25.370 --> 25:27.650
My only concern now is
gettin' you home safely.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.850
<i>- Hey, Vic?
- Yeah?</i>

25:32.930 --> 25:35.010
That, uh, report
you asked for.

25:41.090 --> 25:43.610
[Ronnie] Everything we could find on
Kavanaugh on such short notice.

25:43.730 --> 25:46.690
Word is he gave up his own partner
to I.A.D. Back in the day.

25:46.810 --> 25:49.730
Flies solo. Only investigator that works
without a partner.

25:49.850 --> 25:52.570
Means it's four on one.
That's good. Anything else?

25:52.690 --> 25:55.250
<i>[Shane] Grew up in Inglewood.
Uh, put himself through school.</i>

25:55.330 --> 25:57.170
<i>Degrees in psychology,
criminology.</i>

25:57.250 --> 25:59.410
<i>- Poor kid done good.

25:59.490 --> 26:01.490
Golden Gloves champ

26:01.570 --> 26:03.610
- Stint in Robbery-Homicide.
- Family?

26:03.690 --> 26:05.530
<i>Divorced, no kids.</i>

26:05.610 --> 26:07.810
We gotta figure out
what this guy has to lose.

26:07.930 --> 26:10.850
Look, Everybody's All-American
can't be that clean. Keep diggin'.

26:22.290 --> 26:24.610

26:42.810 --> 26:45.370
<i>- Teresa?

26:45.450 --> 26:48.250

<i>- Shit, shit, shit!

27:29.330 --> 27:31.810

- [Mackey On Radio] Minor detour, Julien.

27:31.930 --> 27:34.010
<i>- Just hold your positions.

27:34.090 --> 27:36.730
<i>[Man] Turn enough tricks,

27:36.810 --> 27:38.290
<i>- Till then do as we say.

27:38.370 --> 27:40.290
<i>[Man] Yeah. As long as you behave,
he'll stay that way.</i>

27:40.370 --> 27:42.170

27:42.290 --> 27:45.090

27:57.050 --> 27:59.090
Yes, fiesta time.

27:59.170 --> 28:01.290

- Screw it. Let's go, man.

28:01.410 --> 28:03.810

28:18.930 --> 28:21.330
<i>[Man] Forget about it.
Never mind.</i>

When we get to the house, we're

- Good girl.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.730
Yeah, shorty's got game.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.650
They're moving.

<i>Long as you don't piss me off,

28:45.090 --> 28:48.850
[Chuckles] I always thought, uh,
face reading should be...

28:48.930 --> 28:51.610
<i>one of the first things
they teach at the academy.</i>

28:51.690 --> 28:55.690
I taught myself. Be happy to loan you
some books and DVD's.

28:55.810 --> 28:58.530
If you want to grab a bite later,
I'll give you a quick rundown.

28:58.650 --> 29:02.210
- Yeah, sounds good.
- You'd be surprised how
transparent people become.

29:02.330 --> 29:04.130
Your partner, for instance.

29:04.250 --> 29:07.570
- Claudette?
- Trying to hide something from you.

29:07.690 --> 29:11.170
<i>Pretty obvious.
Something's in the closet.</i>

29:12.850 --> 29:14.810
<i>The whole pack was over here

29:14.930 --> 29:16.770

Well, thanks for the hand.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.370
[Chattering]

29:29.250 --> 29:31.210
[Curtis] This is his place
or they run girls from here?

29:31.330 --> 29:33.050
<i>[Mackey]
Hold on.</i>

29:33.130 --> 29:35.330
We jump too early,

29:41.010 --> 29:44.210
<i>[Mackey]
Okay. Looks like the madam to me.</i>

29:44.290 --> 29:47.290
That's it. Everybody move in.
Let's bust it. Now!

- [Julien] You okay?

30:33.010 --> 30:35.810
I didn't have my baton,
but every guy's got their weak spot.

30:35.930 --> 30:38.170
How right you are.

30:39.210 --> 30:41.370
Good girl. Nice work.

30:46.050 --> 30:48.690
- Where's the kid?
- This idiot's acting like he doesn't understand.

30:48.770 --> 30:51.010
<i>Found 10 girls off this sheet,
the rest are still missing.</i>

30:51.130 --> 30:52.970
You don't know
about Pablo?

30:53.090 --> 30:55.650
What about the rest
of the girls? And the boys?

30:56.730 --> 30:58.610
I want my lawyer.

30:58.730 --> 31:01.370
Is that the first thing they teach you pricks
once you cross the border?

31:01.450 --> 31:03.970
Put him in the van.

31:04.090 --> 31:06.050
Hey, we take this shithead
to the Barn, he's gonna clam up.

31:06.170 --> 31:09.690
<i>Word gets out about this bust,
we're never gonna find the rest of them.</i>

31:09.770 --> 31:13.810
Well, maybe he's not
as stupid as he looks.

31:15.890 --> 31:18.490
<i>- Come on.
- Let's go, asshole.</i>

31:20.370 --> 31:23.890
This is a shitty day.
We only got about half those kids.

31:23.970 --> 31:26.970
<i>At least we get to stick the needle
in someone for it.</i>

31:27.050 --> 31:30.650
<i>What are you talking about?
Guttierez is gonna get five to seven max.</i>

31:30.730 --> 31:33.330
<i>- Hey, we got three dead girls.
- This asshole wasn't anywhere near that.</i>

31:33.410 --> 31:35.930
We got conspiracy charges, so
he's up for the murders too.

31:36.010 --> 31:37.970
<i>[Mackey]
That's right.</i>

31:38.090 --> 31:40.130
Well, that-
that is good news.

31:40.250 --> 31:42.330
Doesn't mean he's gonna
get the death penalty, though.

31:42.410 --> 31:45.090
<i>- [Mackey] Well, Calhoun is prosecuting.
- Wow. Good.</i>

31:45.210 --> 31:47.010
So I guess
that means he will.

31:47.130 --> 31:49.050
<i>- Who's Calhoun?
- [Mackey] Hey, shut up, you prickl</i>

31:49.170 --> 31:51.210
<i>You wanted a lawyer,
now we can't talk to you.</i>

31:51.330 --> 31:54.170
But I ain't gettin' no death penalty
for some girls I didn't even kill-

31:54.250 --> 31:57.570
<i>- I didn't even see.
- Save it for your last words lying on the gurney.</i>

31:57.650 --> 32:01.210

Yeah.

<i>- But you'll help me, right?
- [Mackey] Where are the rest of the girls?</i>

32:17.010 --> 32:21.250
There's a house on Colquitt,
another one on Adams.

32:21.370 --> 32:23.210
All right, and the boy,
Pablo, where's he at?

32:23.330 --> 32:27.450
Bangkok. They flew him, the rest
of the boys out this afternoon.

32:27.570 --> 32:30.650
- Bangkok?
- Jesus!

32:35.930 --> 32:38.290
- Hey.

32:38.370 --> 32:40.690
Hey, help your sister

32:40.770 --> 32:43.090
How you holdin' up?

32:43.170 --> 32:45.570
Good. Andy's a handful, but,
you know, it's worth it.

32:45.690 --> 32:48.530
Yeah, listen. Here is my address
and phone number.

32:48.610 --> 32:50.650
- Are we still on for that Friday playdate or?
- Yeah.

32:50.730 --> 32:53.370
If there's a problem, I'll call you,
but I'm looking forward to this, really.

32:53.490 --> 32:55.770
Okay.
Where is Andy?

32:55.890 --> 32:59.650
<i>Sometimes I wonder if this extra program
is just an excuse to bilk me out of extra money.</i>

32:59.770 --> 33:02.010
From the school, yes.
The teachers, no.

33:02.130 --> 33:05.250
- You likin' the teacher, or-
- I'm blankin' on her name right now.

33:05.370 --> 33:08.930
Um, remind me. What's-
It's the woman with the, uh-

33:09.050 --> 33:12.370
Um, I thought Mr. Dunhill
taught the after-school program.

33:12.450 --> 33:16.410
- He does, but I'm talking
about her aide. I mean his aide.
- Oh.

33:16.490 --> 33:20.090
<i>Anyway, look,
I'll see you on Friday, if not sooner.</i>

33:20.210 --> 33:24.290
Yeah, good. You know what? I gotta
get my kids home, but I'll see you then, okay?

33:24.410 --> 33:26.490
<i>See ya.</i>

33:29.650 --> 33:32.890
I just got this case
an hour ago.

33:33.010 --> 33:35.370
Why is my client arrested
for second-degree murder...

33:35.490 --> 33:37.290
<i>when another boy
was already arrested?</i>

33:37.410 --> 33:40.410
<i>I'm sure you've heard Every-Day's attorney
is making my life hell.</i>

33:40.490 --> 33:43.210
She's taken depositions
from half the high school.

33:43.330 --> 33:45.770
- Depositions listing you as the shooter.
- Bullshit.

33:45.890 --> 33:48.250
My friends were there.
They saw Every-Day pull that gun.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.170
- What are you writing?
- Every-Day's release.

33:50.250 --> 33:53.210
The D.A. Has decided to drop the case,
charging your client.

33:53.330 --> 33:57.530
Based solely
on witness statements?

33:57.610 --> 34:02.010
<i>Well, they also just found
gun residue in his locker.</i>

34:02.090 --> 34:04.450
<i>[Chuckles]</i>

34:04.570 --> 34:07.450
<i>- What else do you have?
- D.A. Doesn't want me revealing it...</i>

34:07.570 --> 34:10.489
until we're closer to trial.

34:10.610 --> 34:12.409
This does not need
to go to trial.

34:16.570 --> 34:18.850
What do I have to do
to make a deal?

34:18.969 --> 34:22.449
Convince your client to drop
the high school clique crap.

34:22.530 --> 34:24.449
<i>School him on what it's
like to have this evidence...</i>

34:24.570 --> 34:29.090
a high-priced lawyer and a very pissed-off cop
working against him.

34:32.370 --> 34:35.850
Gun residue in a locker?
I'd never let you get away with that.

34:35.969 --> 34:40.610
Cops are allowed to twist the facts to suspects.
I directed my comments to him.

34:40.730 --> 34:43.409
- Evan's being released tonight.
- I know.

34:43.489 --> 34:45.330
Thanks for your help.

34:45.409 --> 34:48.370
I owe you one. I mean that.
Call in a favor whenever you need it.

34:48.449 --> 34:50.370
<i>I will.</i>

34:51.770 --> 34:53.889
<i>I, uh-I heard.</i>

34:55.810 --> 34:57.650
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

34:57.730 --> 35:01.050
- How's yours going?
- Uh, turns out the parolee was coerced.

35:01.130 --> 35:03.770
So he won't go down for the murder
or hacking up the body.

35:03.850 --> 35:05.890
<i>The other guy's
going away for a long time.</i>

35:06.010 --> 35:08.290
And I'm, uh-
I'm sure about him.

35:08.410 --> 35:10.810
<i>Good. Well, where you
running off to?</i>

35:10.930 --> 35:13.690
Uh, dinner with Marshall.

35:13.810 --> 35:16.890
I can't have
other colleagues as friends?

35:16.970 --> 35:20.050
Marshall has quite a reputation
as a man's man...

35:20.130 --> 35:23.290
<i>- if you know what I mean.
- He- He's gay?</i>

35:23.370 --> 35:27.090
<i>While you were reading faces,
he was reading your package.</i>

35:27.170 --> 35:29.090
Have fun though.

35:38.370 --> 35:41.890
The cage would look a whole lot prettier
with Abuela's ugly mug in it.

35:42.010 --> 35:43.970
Sure you don't want to find
the loophole in our deal?

35:44.090 --> 35:47.770
I couldn't let you run roughshod
over a little old lady, much as she deserved it.

35:47.850 --> 35:50.130
You lookin'
for more business?

35:50.210 --> 35:54.970
I appreciate the offer, but I'm okay watching
from the sidelines while they get theirs.

35:55.050 --> 35:57.370
Right now, I'd like to go home
and wash this place off me.

35:57.490 --> 35:59.330
You talkin' about the cops
or the criminals?

35:59.450 --> 36:02.610
See you in court
someday, Detective.

36:04.970 --> 36:06.850
- [Door Buzzes]
- Vic?

36:09.290 --> 36:11.290
I got something important.

36:11.410 --> 36:13.610
Someone has been
asking questions.

36:13.730 --> 36:16.290
<i>- Who?
- This man. He's approached me a few times.</i>

36:16.410 --> 36:18.210
- Where at?
- Glenridge.

36:18.330 --> 36:21.490
He, uh- He said he was
the parent of an autistic child.

36:21.570 --> 36:24.250
But I've been around cops
long enough to know what they sound like.

36:24.330 --> 36:27.610
Besides, I've never even
seen his kid, so-

36:27.690 --> 36:29.490
That him?

36:30.570 --> 36:33.290
Yeah. Why's he coming
to our school?

36:33.410 --> 36:35.890
- What did he ask you?
- I'm trying to remember.

36:35.970 --> 36:38.650
Something about paying the tuition
and, uh, how do we do it...

36:38.770 --> 36:40.690
<i>how involved you are.</i>

36:40.770 --> 36:45.170
- What did you tell him?
- I told him you gave us money
for whatever we needed.

36:46.530 --> 36:48.570
<i>I was trying to sell you
as a good dad.</i>

36:53.730 --> 36:55.930
I didn't tell him
about the cash in the bag.

36:56.050 --> 36:58.530
Good. Don't tell him shit.

36:58.650 --> 37:02.290
Asshole has no business talking to you
about this. It's my problem.

37:02.370 --> 37:05.010
I'll take care of it.
All right?

37:11.090 --> 37:13.970
[Moaning]

37:18.010 --> 37:20.050
Oh, I'm gonna come.

37:27.650 --> 37:29.570
Ahhh.

37:30.650 --> 37:32.930
Mmm.

37:40.570 --> 37:42.810
<i>- Is everything okay?
- [Exhales]</i>

37:45.730 --> 37:47.130
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah?</i>

37:47.210 --> 37:48.730
Mm-hmm.

37:49.810 --> 37:52.130
That was great.

37:52.250 --> 37:55.490
But, uh,
you were somewhere else.

38:01.410 --> 38:03.330
<i>Is it about
that meeting this morning?</i>

38:06.690 --> 38:08.570
Yeah.

38:08.650 --> 38:12.010
<i>Lem's in
some hot water.</i>

38:12.130 --> 38:14.290
Yeah.

38:14.370 --> 38:17.370
- How hot?
- We don't know yet.

38:19.650 --> 38:21.970
I thought you said that you
were done with all that-

38:22.050 --> 38:23.770
that you were
gonna keep clean.

38:23.890 --> 38:25.850
<i>- I have been.
- Yeah?</i>

38:25.970 --> 38:27.930
I swear.

38:29.010 --> 38:31.050
Then why you
so worried?

38:34.770 --> 38:38.170
- Hmm?
- Don't you worry.

38:38.290 --> 38:40.090
Okay?

38:40.210 --> 38:43.930
We'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.

38:44.050 --> 38:47.610
"We" meaning you and Vic?

38:47.690 --> 38:50.810
- Together as a team, standing behind Lem?
- No. Listen.

38:50.890 --> 38:53.530
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

38:53.610 --> 38:57.010
The team's one thing,
but family's another.

38:58.410 --> 39:01.850
All that stuff that happened
with Antwon. You know.

39:01.970 --> 39:06.250
- Yeah.
- I was looking at prison in the eye.

39:06.370 --> 39:08.690
- I know. I know.
- Hey.

39:08.770 --> 39:11.850
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to us.

39:16.530 --> 39:19.610
Jackson needs his father.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.850
Well, I need
the both of you.

39:22.970 --> 39:24.770
Hear me?

39:26.850 --> 39:28.930
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

39:33.610 --> 39:37.050
Buddy in Immigration called.
He's putting the word out on Pablo.

39:37.130 --> 39:41.090
<i>Spoke to an American diplomat
in Bangkok.</i>

39:41.210 --> 39:45.370
- I meant what I said about not giving up on him.
- Okay. Good.

39:47.450 --> 39:51.490
I feel like there's some unfinished
business between us.

39:51.610 --> 39:53.650
What's that?

39:56.850 --> 39:59.530
<i>It's this Terry thing.</i>

39:59.650 --> 40:02.930
<i>You thought I was hiding something
from you.</i>

40:03.010 --> 40:05.090
<i>Here's the truth.</i>

40:07.730 --> 40:10.330
I swept through that house.

40:10.410 --> 40:13.290
I cleared that bathroom.

40:13.410 --> 40:15.250
At least I thought I did.

40:15.330 --> 40:18.010
<i>Somehow Two-Time
got past me.</i>

40:19.330 --> 40:21.170
<i>I left Terry exposed.</i>

40:26.930 --> 40:29.210
I made a mistake.

40:29.330 --> 40:31.770
<i>I never told anybody.
I thought it was my fault.</i>

40:31.890 --> 40:34.850
That's something I've been
living with for a long time now.

40:41.450 --> 40:43.650
Finally, I decided to move on.

40:45.690 --> 40:48.210
Something you're gonna have
to push past too.

41:07.490 --> 41:10.050
<i>- Yeah.
- Okay.</i>

41:11.410 --> 41:13.530
<i>- [Knocking]
- Hey, Vic-</i>

41:13.610 --> 41:15.450
Her Majesty, Billings,
needs to see you.

41:15.530 --> 41:17.850
<i>- Tell him I'll be right there.
- Got it.</i>

41:28.410 --> 41:31.090
- What's up?
- Somebody here to see you.

41:31.170 --> 41:34.970
<i>Jon Kavanaugh.
Internal Affairs.</i>

41:35.050 --> 41:37.090
- Vic Mackey.
- Yeah.

41:38.170 --> 41:40.530
Mind if I have
a moment alone, Captain?

41:40.610 --> 41:43.130
<i>- Nah, not at all.
- Thank you.</i>

41:49.850 --> 41:51.650
What can
I do for you, Detective?

41:51.770 --> 41:53.850
<i>- It's lieutenant.
- Right.</i>

41:53.970 --> 41:55.850
<i>We're just cops,
just like you.</i>

41:55.970 --> 41:57.850
I guess the, uh, good looks,
it just throws everybody off.

41:57.930 --> 42:00.410
<i>[Chuckles]
Anyhow.</i>

42:00.530 --> 42:02.730
We're making
a tour of the division.

42:02.850 --> 42:06.730
With the budget cuts, the, uh, bosses,
they're afraid that there might be...

42:06.850 --> 42:10.850
uh, a lot of temptation
to take shortcuts.

42:10.970 --> 42:14.970
And I'm just here to remind everyone
that I'm still on the case...

42:15.090 --> 42:18.410
<i>and there is a right way
to do things.</i>

42:18.530 --> 42:21.690
I've been a cop for 14 years.
You guys never toured before.

42:21.810 --> 42:23.930
New management.

42:24.050 --> 42:27.410
Putting a friendlier face
on the old "rat squad."

42:27.530 --> 42:29.410
[Chuckles]
Anyhow.

42:29.530 --> 42:32.850
There is no reason why you and I should not
be on the same page.

42:32.970 --> 42:35.490
Why you talkin' to me?

42:35.610 --> 42:37.490
You run a Special Team.

42:37.570 --> 42:39.850
Those get most
of the abuse allegations.

42:39.970 --> 42:43.610
And from what I hear,
those people out there...

42:43.730 --> 42:45.610
<i>they all follow your lead.</i>

42:45.730 --> 42:49.490
Well, can't blame 'em
for having good judgment.

42:49.570 --> 42:53.690
Is there anything brewing I should
know about? Anything at all suspicious?

42:55.810 --> 42:58.530
Not that I can think of.

42:58.650 --> 43:00.450
You sure?

43:05.730 --> 43:07.730
It is good to meet you.
