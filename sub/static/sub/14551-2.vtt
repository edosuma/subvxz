00:06.811 --> 00:08.810
Previously on Powers...

00:08.811 --> 00:11.242
- Outer Banks Patrol Division.
- What was that like?

00:11.242 --> 00:14.672
Some Power gets out of hand,
policy was leave 'em the fuck alone.

00:14.704 --> 00:16.504
We don't leave them the fuck alone here.

00:16.562 --> 00:18.497
Iron Impact, ladies and gentlemen.

00:19.336 --> 00:21.296
Shit!

00:23.101 --> 00:24.101
Yeah. What...

00:24.199 --> 00:25.531
Krispin?

00:25.594 --> 00:26.594
Kill any more Powers?

00:26.617 --> 00:27.817
I was a Power, Krispin.

00:27.887 --> 00:29.587
You were a hero, Walker.

00:29.637 --> 00:31.006
That's different from just being a Power.

00:31.097 --> 00:34.887
He hooked Olympia up with a girl.
Got her to pass him some Sway.

00:34.887 --> 00:38.606
Whatever was in this envelope,
was also in his bloodstream.

00:38.664 --> 00:39.986
You hooked up with Retro Girl?

00:39.996 --> 00:41.996
I know everything about her.

00:42.996 --> 00:44.372
What was that?

00:44.376 --> 00:45.708
Johnny Royalle.

00:47.251 --> 00:48.707
Everyone says Royalle is dead.

00:48.708 --> 00:50.707
Okay, Wolfe ate Royalle.

00:50.708 --> 00:52.668
What happened to Royalle?

00:52.708 --> 00:55.707
He was right there, and then he went away.

00:55.708 --> 00:59.707
Christian. You can have everything back.

00:59.708 --> 01:01.707
Just get me out of here.

01:01.708 --> 01:03.707
"You can have them all back?"

01:03.708 --> 01:07.707
My powers! He has my fucking powers!

01:07.708 --> 01:10.707
You don't belong here. Little Wannabe.

01:10.708 --> 01:11.708
Let's get out of here.

01:13.335 --> 01:14.708
Shit.

01:19.501 --> 01:21.708
Christian. You stupid son of a bitch.

Hey!

01:43.708 --> 01:46.335
Diamond? Walker?

01:48.708 --> 01:50.627
You okay?

01:52.708 --> 01:53.707
Albert?

01:53.708 --> 01:55.298
I thought that was you, Diamond.

01:55.299 --> 01:57.707
Hey, don't call me that, okay?

01:57.708 --> 02:00.707
Oh, sure. Sure.

02:00.708 --> 02:02.707
You okay?

02:02.708 --> 02:03.708
Uh...

02:04.708 --> 02:08.585
Yeah. Yeah. I, uh...

02:08.708 --> 02:11.707
Was she here? You guys see each other?

02:11.708 --> 02:14.043
Are you getting back together?

02:14.335 --> 02:16.335
No, nothing like that.

02:16.627 --> 02:19.501
Boy, it was exciting back then.

02:19.708 --> 02:21.707
You and her flying through
the night sky together,

02:21.708 --> 02:23.501
keeping us safe.

02:24.708 --> 02:28.708
She doesn't come up here
much anymore. Not since...

02:29.708 --> 02:32.707
Appreciate all you did for us, Albert.

02:32.708 --> 02:35.707
You were a good friend.

02:35.708 --> 02:37.708
It was a pleasure.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.585
Need me to call you a cab?

02:39.708 --> 02:43.707
No, I have my car down there somewhere.

02:43.708 --> 02:44.708
Yeah.

02:47.708 --> 02:48.708
You take care. Sure.

02:50.708 --> 02:54.707
You come up here anytime you want, Diamond.

02:54.708 --> 02:55.708
I got your back.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.708
These things are gonna kill me.

03:08.708 --> 03:10.001
Something's gonna kill you.

03:10.293 --> 03:13.707
Six months to retirement,
like you're wearing crosshairs.

03:13.708 --> 03:16.585
- You too old for this shit, Adlard?
- Oh, shut up.

03:17.708 --> 03:19.707
What's goin' on with Olympia?

03:19.708 --> 03:20.708
Still dead.

03:20.751 --> 03:24.707
Some red shit mixed in with his
DNA has Dr. Death all spazzed out.

03:24.708 --> 03:25.707
He was poisoned?

03:25.708 --> 03:28.707
- Or maybe some new Powers drug.
- Shit.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.707
Superstar gonna show up or what?

03:30.708 --> 03:32.707
You don't want to wait for
him, don't wait for him.

03:32.708 --> 03:34.708
SOP is we wait for Walker.

03:37.543 --> 03:38.708
By the popsicles.

03:39.708 --> 03:41.708
Zerotron loves those popsicles.

03:44.708 --> 03:46.707
You ever serve a Powers warrant?

03:46.708 --> 03:48.168
Nope.

03:48.460 --> 03:51.708
When we go, move fast,
hit hard, keep hitting.

03:54.708 --> 03:57.335
Shit. He's moving.

03:57.627 --> 03:58.707
Fucking Walker.

03:58.708 --> 04:00.708
We can't take him on the
street. Too much metal.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.708
Let's fly the colors.

04:15.126 --> 04:16.565
Keep your spacing!

04:16.565 --> 04:18.584
- He's getting too close!
- Hold the fucking line!

04:22.708 --> 04:24.708
I didn't do nothing!

04:24.918 --> 04:27.708
Just leave me the fuck alone
or I'll zap you to shit!

04:27.708 --> 04:29.707
Easy, Zerotron, easy.

04:29.708 --> 04:31.708
You can't ride the lightning!

04:34.708 --> 04:35.708
Go!

04:39.668 --> 04:41.707
He's gonna arc!

04:41.708 --> 04:42.708
No, no, no! Don't do that!

04:48.708 --> 04:52.708
Let's tape this asshole's
eyes shut before he wakes up.

04:54.708 --> 04:58.708
If you can't get your leading man
here, at least don't fuck up the show.

Damn it.

05:56.708 --> 05:57.708
Fuck.

06:18.708 --> 06:21.707
The caller you have dialed is unavailable.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.708
Hey, it's me. Um...

06:24.708 --> 06:25.708
I...

06:27.708 --> 06:29.293
We need to talk.

06:29.543 --> 06:30.708
Um... call me.

06:31.876 --> 06:33.708
It's Christian.

06:40.708 --> 06:42.043
Shit.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.708
The caller you have dialed is unavailable.

06:53.708 --> 06:56.707
Me again. We need to talk about the girl.

06:56.708 --> 07:00.608
Um, she's a witness.
So, it's official shit.

07:01.708 --> 07:02.708
Call me.

07:11.708 --> 07:12.708
Shit.

08:38.707 --> 08:41.126
I'll see the supplier.
We'll make more tonight.

08:41.707 --> 08:43.707
Thank you.

08:43.707 --> 08:45.876
Does the girl know where it comes from?

08:46.168 --> 08:48.707
- No.
- You sure?

08:48.708 --> 08:50.708
Calista is not a threat.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.585
We should talk to...

08:54.708 --> 08:58.608
However dangerous or benign
she is, she is my concern.

09:16.708 --> 09:17.707
Thank you.

09:17.708 --> 09:20.707
I am not your personal assistant.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.460
What's in your ass this morning?

09:22.708 --> 09:23.708
Zerotron-X.

09:24.708 --> 09:25.707
Oh, shit.

09:25.708 --> 09:27.585
Where is he now?

09:28.168 --> 09:29.707
Are the guys tailing him?

09:29.708 --> 09:30.707
He's in custody.

09:30.708 --> 09:32.707
What the fuck?

09:32.708 --> 09:35.707
What happened? How'd it go down?

09:35.708 --> 09:37.707
I drew a little current.

09:37.708 --> 09:39.251
You charged in didn't you?

09:41.708 --> 09:43.834
You're gonna get somebody
killed. I'm tellin' you.

09:44.708 --> 09:46.708
I'm gonna... Jesus.

09:48.668 --> 09:51.707
Where were you, Mr. Essential Personnel?

09:51.708 --> 09:53.707
I was working the fucking case.

09:53.708 --> 09:55.708
You were working the fucking case?

09:56.708 --> 09:58.707
I was working the fucking case,

09:58.708 --> 10:01.307
and I saw Calista last night.

10:01.708 --> 10:03.707
What the... where is she?

10:03.708 --> 10:04.708
Retro Girl has her.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.708
How did that happen?

10:08.708 --> 10:13.608
Calista jumped off the Tower,
and Retro Girl caught her.

10:14.708 --> 10:16.707
What the fuck?

10:16.708 --> 10:21.707
I know. The girl jumped off the Tower

10:21.708 --> 10:23.707
because she thought it
might give her powers.

10:23.708 --> 10:24.708
It did not.

10:24.876 --> 10:27.707
So how do we go about finding Retro Girl?

10:27.708 --> 10:30.707
I left a message on her personal line.

10:30.708 --> 10:32.707
Her personal line?

10:32.708 --> 10:35.707
- Yeah, hopefully she'll call me back.
- Okay.

10:35.708 --> 10:38.707
Does she usually call
back right away, or...

10:38.708 --> 10:41.707
I haven't called in a very long time,

10:41.708 --> 10:44.707
and you can stop with
the questions, please.

10:44.708 --> 10:46.708
I kind of have to ask a question.

10:47.808 --> 10:49.526
Do we have to wait for her to call you back

10:49.564 --> 10:51.708
or do you know where she lives?

10:54.708 --> 10:56.418
I know where she lives.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.707
Can you please stop that?

11:09.708 --> 11:10.708
This is the wrong tie.

11:12.708 --> 11:15.707
I had these lucky ties.

11:15.708 --> 11:18.707
They were exactly the right length.

11:18.708 --> 11:23.707
I had a dozen of them made
when I took off the mask,

11:23.708 --> 11:25.707
but only have one left and I can't find it.

11:25.708 --> 11:28.543
It's fine. You look great.

11:30.708 --> 11:33.708
Is there something I should
know before meeting Retro Girl?

11:34.708 --> 11:36.708
We're not going to Retro Girl's.

11:37.708 --> 11:38.708
What?

11:40.043 --> 11:42.708
You're gonna take a left on Franklin.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.707
Olympia's widow?

11:46.708 --> 11:48.707
You think she had something
to do with his death?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.707
Fuck no.

11:50.708 --> 11:52.707
Yeah, whenever I heard
"fuck no" back in Sheriff's,

11:52.708 --> 11:53.707
I always looked closer.

11:53.708 --> 11:54.707
Deena, please...

11:54.708 --> 11:57.708
Yeah, he turns up dead
cheating on his wife.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.708
She's not that kind of wife.

12:04.708 --> 12:06.708
He was always such a little boy at heart.

12:07.708 --> 12:10.708
He was charming. I was a studious girl.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.708
Real high school sweethearts, huh?

12:16.708 --> 12:20.708
And when he changed, I
thought it would change him.

12:22.708 --> 12:25.708
Grow him up, you know,
having all that power.

12:26.708 --> 12:30.707
But instead he stopped growing altogether.

12:30.708 --> 12:34.707
Why change when everyone loves
you exactly the way you are?

12:34.708 --> 12:38.707
Even if what you are is a
16-year-old boy in a man's body.

12:38.708 --> 12:40.707
So what he was doing the night he died,

12:40.708 --> 12:42.707
that was nothing new.

12:42.708 --> 12:45.708
Well, I made a point of
not knowing the details,

12:47.708 --> 12:50.707
but if he died licking coke
off the tits of a groupie

12:50.708 --> 12:52.707
while her friend gave him a rim job,

12:52.708 --> 12:55.708
then, yes, that was
nothing new for my husband.

12:58.708 --> 13:01.707
No, marriage is hard.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.708
Forty years of it, nearly impossible.

13:05.708 --> 13:08.707
Boy we banged some good times, though.

13:08.708 --> 13:11.708
Back in the '70s, we pretty
much fucked anything that moved.

13:13.708 --> 13:17.460
We smoked it, we drank
it and we snorted it.

13:17.708 --> 13:19.708
Hell, yeah, times were different then.

13:20.708 --> 13:22.210
But they couldn't last.

13:24.708 --> 13:26.707
Are you sure I can't offer either

13:26.708 --> 13:28.627
one of you a little eye opener?

13:28.708 --> 13:29.959
- No, thanks.
- No, no.

13:30.708 --> 13:31.708
Uh...

13:33.708 --> 13:36.507
It wasn't groupies last night, Lenore.

13:37.708 --> 13:38.708
He was with a girl.

13:40.001 --> 13:41.707
Young.

13:41.708 --> 13:43.709
Jesus shit, how young?

13:44.001 --> 13:45.707
Do you think she had anything...

13:45.708 --> 13:47.707
No. Maybe.

13:47.708 --> 13:52.708
He say anything lately? A
special girl he was into? A place?

13:54.708 --> 13:57.335
He's been hitting a new underground place.

13:57.627 --> 13:58.707
One of those pop-ups.

13:58.708 --> 14:00.707
Lots of young ass.

14:00.708 --> 14:02.708
No place for an old lady.

14:04.708 --> 14:05.707
Um...

14:05.708 --> 14:06.708
Here and Gone.

14:10.708 --> 14:13.508
To my husband, Olympia.

14:16.708 --> 14:19.508
The best lay in the world.

14:27.708 --> 14:28.707
Here and Gone.

14:28.708 --> 14:29.708
Uh-huh.

14:32.084 --> 14:33.707
You got that hottie's number?

14:33.708 --> 14:35.708
Yeah, Zora. I saw her last night.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.707
Jesus, Walker.

14:37.708 --> 14:40.708
Nothing happened. And I
know where to find her.

14:41.708 --> 14:43.708
Just drive the car.

14:45.708 --> 14:47.708
I'm really sorry, Krispin.

14:49.708 --> 14:52.207
I hate that word, grief.

14:52.708 --> 14:54.707
It even sounds depressing.

14:54.708 --> 14:57.507
Like some great big weight
you can't wait to put down.

14:57.708 --> 15:00.508
But what you're really feeling is just...

15:53.001 --> 15:55.708
Why were you on that roof with Walker?

15:57.708 --> 15:59.708
I remember when you did that.

16:03.293 --> 16:05.707
You weren't born when I did that.

16:05.708 --> 16:08.707
I used to watch your Powers
That Be top hits with my mom.

16:08.708 --> 16:12.335
That was October 28th, 1982.

16:12.627 --> 16:14.708
Capricious Scream attacked
you when you were on patrol.

16:14.709 --> 16:17.708
Revenge, 'cause you put
Bloody Marky in the Shaft.

16:17.708 --> 16:21.359
Well, Capricious Scream
attacked me during a press event,

16:24.251 --> 16:26.476
so that she could get her
face in front of the cameras

16:26.477 --> 16:28.708
before she launched her
naughty little lingerie line.

16:28.709 --> 16:30.001
Oh.

16:31.418 --> 16:32.708
Did Walker take you up there?

16:34.708 --> 16:36.708
I like the original costume best.

16:36.709 --> 16:38.918
The miniskirt and the go-go boots.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.043
Hmm.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.708
Well, I only wore it in action once.

16:43.708 --> 16:45.707
I punched Helix Rize
and my boob popped out.

16:45.708 --> 16:48.557
Every time I fought him after
that, he called me super tits.

16:51.708 --> 16:53.707
This is awesome.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.708
Hanging out with you, it's awesome.

16:58.376 --> 17:00.708
We are not hanging out.

17:01.708 --> 17:04.707
I caught you as you were
falling at terminal velocity.

17:04.708 --> 17:07.707
And I did so without breaking
your neck, which was hard.

17:07.708 --> 17:10.708
Now normally, I would have
taken you to the hospital,

17:10.708 --> 17:12.309
but you were falling in the arms of a man

17:12.310 --> 17:15.708
with whom I share an
incredibly complicated history.

17:15.708 --> 17:17.708
And you were dressed like
me, which made me wonder

17:17.709 --> 17:20.707
if something very fucked up was
happening between the two of you.

17:20.708 --> 17:23.084
No, nothing like that.

17:25.708 --> 17:28.708
I was with Olympia when he died.

17:30.376 --> 17:33.708
Walker was kind of chasing me, I guess.

17:42.708 --> 17:44.707
You wanna get the girl now, or...

17:44.708 --> 17:47.460
You get her. I need to
speak to my publicist.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.708
Did you find that reporter?

17:49.792 --> 17:52.210
Yes. She's psyched.

17:52.501 --> 17:55.708
Well, then I'm about to
become very exposed indeed.

17:59.708 --> 18:02.668
We open tonight. Put the
word out to the Powerz Kidz.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.644
I want them to know they have a place here.

18:06.708 --> 18:08.708
No more foundlings, my friend.

18:19.708 --> 18:20.708
Everything okay?

18:23.708 --> 18:25.708
You feel like you know me?

18:26.084 --> 18:27.707
Yeah, better than most.

18:27.708 --> 18:29.376
What's wrong?

18:30.708 --> 18:31.708
I don't know.

18:42.708 --> 18:46.707
Hmm, "Zora." You're popular.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.707
Okay, I showed you the
pop-up club, can I go now?

18:49.708 --> 18:52.335
Got some heavy duty hanging out to do?

18:53.460 --> 18:56.707
You don't even know.

18:57.708 --> 18:59.707
I could drop you in the
shit so fucking fast.

18:59.708 --> 19:01.707
Was that a threat?

19:01.708 --> 19:03.376
Huh?

19:03.627 --> 19:04.708
Are you high?

19:06.708 --> 19:08.708
Oh, you on that new red shit?

19:11.708 --> 19:13.126
I don't get high.

19:14.708 --> 19:15.708
I'm a Power.

19:16.708 --> 19:19.708
You can't imagine what that feels like.

19:25.043 --> 19:26.708
And you've forgotten.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.708
No, I haven't.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.708
Being young and powerful,

19:39.708 --> 19:41.708
it feels like you could
save the whole world

19:43.251 --> 19:46.708
if everybody would just
stay out of your way.

19:48.001 --> 19:49.708
Oh, shit.

19:49.709 --> 19:51.418
Walker?

19:53.708 --> 19:54.708
Hey, Zora,

19:54.876 --> 19:57.043
the guy who runs the pop-ups...

19:57.708 --> 19:59.708
Pale? Skinny?

20:00.708 --> 20:02.708
Yeah.

20:02.708 --> 20:05.588
Get out of here. What the fuck?

20:05.606 --> 20:06.708
She's got nothing to do with this.

20:06.709 --> 20:08.708
How do you know she's got nothing... I...

20:11.210 --> 20:12.959
- Get out of here.
- Go.

20:16.959 --> 20:18.376
Is it...

20:18.668 --> 20:19.668
Jesus!

20:21.708 --> 20:23.707
It's naked.

20:23.708 --> 20:24.709
We got that part.

20:25.001 --> 20:27.707
Not naked of clothing Detective Pilgrim,

20:27.708 --> 20:30.707
naked of physical evidence.

20:30.708 --> 20:33.707
There is roughly 24 hours'
worth of dust on this body.

20:33.708 --> 20:37.707
Other than that, there are no
dead skin cells on this body.

20:37.708 --> 20:40.707
The millions of infinitesimal
particles and microbes

20:40.708 --> 20:44.707
that occupy the surface of the
human skin are all but absent.

20:44.708 --> 20:47.708
As if a great wind has blown it clean.

20:49.708 --> 20:50.707
What did this?

20:50.708 --> 20:51.708
Nothing.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.668
Nothing?

20:54.708 --> 20:56.707
Until you can prove the existence

20:56.708 --> 20:58.707
of a blade of infinite thinness,

20:58.708 --> 21:01.707
one that can cleave
perfectly between molecules,

21:01.708 --> 21:05.168
I will maintain that
nothing created that wound.

21:05.460 --> 21:06.707
Lasers.

21:06.708 --> 21:08.585
Lasers generate heat.

21:08.708 --> 21:10.707
You will observe an absence of burns.

21:10.708 --> 21:13.501
Okay, so...

21:13.708 --> 21:16.627
Forced to guess, I'd have
to assume that a portal

21:16.708 --> 21:19.707
from an alternate dimension
briefly occupied the physical space

21:19.708 --> 21:22.707
that once contained this man's head.

21:22.708 --> 21:24.707
Can you get an ID off his prints?

21:24.708 --> 21:26.126
It has no prints.

21:26.418 --> 21:28.707
The impossible implement
that removed its head,

21:28.708 --> 21:31.707
has achieved a similar
feat with its finger prints.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.708
Dental records will also be problematic.

21:35.708 --> 21:36.876
You know what I like?

21:37.168 --> 21:38.460
Talking?

21:39.708 --> 21:40.708
Guns.

21:40.918 --> 21:43.707
I like how guns kill people by
shoving a bullet through their flesh

21:43.708 --> 21:46.627
leaving a trail of evidence a mile long.

21:48.627 --> 21:51.707
So, did you notice how we found a dead body

21:51.708 --> 21:53.834
in the club where Olympia was partying?

21:54.084 --> 21:56.708
Before he turned up dead himself, I mean.

21:58.709 --> 22:02.251
Look, that's another dead
body connected to Calista.

22:02.543 --> 22:05.708
I told you, Retro Girl
didn't return my call.

22:07.708 --> 22:11.460
Life is complicated, but
you gotta get over that.

22:12.585 --> 22:13.918
What Calista knows or saw

22:14.168 --> 22:16.708
could turn this whole thing on its head.

22:19.708 --> 22:22.707
Fuck it, let's go. Take
the Mint Street on-ramp.

22:22.708 --> 22:23.708
Okay.

22:26.708 --> 22:27.959
So how did you meet Olympia?

22:28.959 --> 22:30.707
At a club.

22:30.708 --> 22:32.707
There's an app, Power Seekers,

22:32.708 --> 22:35.708
where people tag the
spots that Powers hang out.

22:38.708 --> 22:40.708
And you were just...

22:42.585 --> 22:45.708
I went up to him, and he liked me,

22:46.708 --> 22:48.707
and he took me home.

22:48.708 --> 22:50.460
And you were wearing that?

22:51.460 --> 22:52.708
Yeah.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.708
How come you don't fight villains anymore?

22:58.708 --> 23:01.708
It's like you talk about
things that need to be fixed.

23:08.708 --> 23:10.708
Come here for a moment.

23:14.708 --> 23:15.707
Hurricane Pulp.

23:15.708 --> 23:18.708
It's going to make landfall
within the next 48 hours.

23:20.708 --> 23:22.707
Thousands will die,

23:22.708 --> 23:25.043
and there's nothing I can do to stop that.

23:25.335 --> 23:29.707
But when the storm hits, I'll be there

23:29.708 --> 23:32.084
saving as many lives as I can.

23:32.376 --> 23:33.707
One at a time.

23:33.708 --> 23:38.543
Because as powerful I am,
I still have only two hands.

23:44.708 --> 23:48.708
Now you tell me, why were you on that roof?

23:50.708 --> 23:51.708
Walker took me.

23:53.708 --> 23:55.708
He said that you hang out there.

23:57.708 --> 24:00.084
I guess he was trying to
impress me or something.

24:01.210 --> 24:02.708
Get me to talk about Olympia.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.707
But he got all worked up
when I didn't say anything

24:06.708 --> 24:09.707
and he pushed me.

24:09.708 --> 24:14.708
And I fell and he tried to
grab me, and we both fell.

24:17.708 --> 24:19.126
That's the truth.

24:20.708 --> 24:22.708
Excuse me.

24:23.708 --> 24:25.708
There are detectives at the gate.

24:25.708 --> 24:28.429
Please just have them wait
in my office. Thank you, Eva.

24:34.708 --> 24:37.708
Come with me. You'll be safe
outside until they're gone.

24:52.293 --> 24:53.708
Yeah.

24:55.708 --> 24:58.707
You are one Powers pwning motherfucker.

24:58.778 --> 25:00.777
Uh, thanks.

25:00.778 --> 25:02.862
Except now everyone on the
server is out to kill me.

25:03.113 --> 25:04.778
Or not.

25:05.778 --> 25:06.778
What? Did you do that?

25:07.778 --> 25:09.778
Eh, I got skills.

25:10.029 --> 25:13.029
Are you going on missions
or just messing around?

25:13.321 --> 25:14.777
I'm looking for Iron Impact.

25:14.778 --> 25:16.613
Oh, he's not in this update.

25:16.778 --> 25:18.778
They took him out after he killed that cop.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.197
You know what they didn't
get right in this game?

25:24.198 --> 25:26.777
No regular people die.

25:26.778 --> 25:30.238
You know, like a Power demolishes a school.

25:30.530 --> 25:31.778
All the kids get out.

25:31.946 --> 25:35.778
A Power crashes a plane, no
dead bodies in the wreckage.

25:38.405 --> 25:39.777
It's bullshit.

25:39.778 --> 25:40.794
Yeah.

25:40.824 --> 25:43.778
I mean, I know people who
have, you know, lost people.

25:44.778 --> 25:47.778
I mean, my cousin was, you know...

25:51.778 --> 25:55.777
So, you want to go stomp
the crap out of Iron Impact?

25:55.778 --> 25:57.778
I thought you said they took him out.

25:57.779 --> 25:59.778
I got a work around for it.

26:06.778 --> 26:08.513
I've been waiting for you to call.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.778
I left a message.

26:13.862 --> 26:15.778
Oh, really? Hmm.

26:16.778 --> 26:18.029
No, no one told me.

26:19.778 --> 26:21.778
On the number that I used to...

26:22.778 --> 26:24.321
The old number.

26:24.613 --> 26:26.777
I don't use that number anymore.

26:26.778 --> 26:28.777
Well, I left a message on it.

26:28.778 --> 26:31.613
Well, not for me.

26:31.778 --> 26:33.777
I'm Detective Pilgrim.

26:33.778 --> 26:34.778
Yeah, uh...

26:35.778 --> 26:37.777
I assume you work with him. How do you do?

26:37.778 --> 26:40.530
Yes, right, I do. Good to meet you, Ma'am.

26:40.778 --> 26:42.777
Oh, Ma'am.

26:42.778 --> 26:44.777
Not that you look like one I just...

26:44.778 --> 26:46.405
You grew up with me.

26:46.697 --> 26:47.777
Yeah.

26:47.778 --> 26:50.778
Well, the entire world
grew up with me, Detective.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.777
We need the girl.

26:53.778 --> 26:56.777
Well, she says that you
pushed her off that tower.

26:56.778 --> 26:57.778
No, she's lying.

26:58.778 --> 26:59.777
She jumped.

26:59.778 --> 27:01.777
Well, no, no, I know she's lying.

27:01.778 --> 27:03.777
I've spent all day listening to her lies

27:03.778 --> 27:05.778
and waiting for you to
either call or come by.

27:07.778 --> 27:08.778
Here we are.

27:08.946 --> 27:12.988
Yes, indeed. So, she jumped?

27:13.238 --> 27:16.405
Yeah, look, we need to
talk to her. It's important.

27:16.697 --> 27:18.777
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

27:18.778 --> 27:19.778
She jumped.

27:20.778 --> 27:23.571
And you did what?

27:23.778 --> 27:26.029
Because when I caught her,
she was hanging onto you.

27:27.778 --> 27:29.777
You jumped too, Christian.

27:29.778 --> 27:32.777
The kid went over. I wanted to save her.

27:32.778 --> 27:36.777
I felt like, I felt like maybe I could.

27:36.778 --> 27:39.777
So, is the girl here or not?

27:39.778 --> 27:42.778
Because if she's here, we'd
like to get on with our job.

27:49.862 --> 27:51.777
Shit.

27:51.778 --> 27:52.777
Where is she?

27:52.778 --> 27:54.778
There's nowhere for her to go.

27:54.988 --> 27:56.778
It's Royalle!

27:58.778 --> 28:01.777
Royalle is alive. I think.

28:01.778 --> 28:04.738
I think he had something
to do with Olympia.

28:05.778 --> 28:07.071
And the girl knows.

28:07.321 --> 28:08.778
That's why we need her.

It's okay.

28:32.778 --> 28:33.778

28:36.196 --> 28:38.777
- How was work?
- Good.

I need you to be really professional.

What?

30:29.778 --> 30:31.777
He has no wants or warrants.

30:31.778 --> 30:33.655
He has not been charged with anything.

30:33.778 --> 30:35.777
He is simply filling out a
Use Of Powers Certificate.

30:35.778 --> 30:38.777
"Describe the parameters of
your power in terms of range,

30:38.778 --> 30:41.778
tensile strength, watts,
volts, pounds per square inch."

30:42.778 --> 30:44.777
We cannot touch him.

"Max speed, max altitude

You remember when we didn't
have to do any of this?

31:00.778 --> 31:03.655
Nobody cared how far or
how fast you could fly.

31:04.778 --> 31:06.778

it's askew.

I'm here to register
my powers as law demands

32:03.778 --> 32:06.513
not to defend myself or flee.

32:06.599 --> 32:07.994
Here and Gone, motherfucker.

32:13.778 --> 32:14.778
Stop.

32:26.778 --> 32:30.029
Walker, you can let him go. He's alive, uh?

32:30.321 --> 32:32.778
You were right. You were right.

32:36.778 --> 32:38.778
You're happy to see me then, huh?

32:40.778 --> 32:43.777
Where's Calista?

32:43.778 --> 32:48.778
Is that really what you want
to know after all these years?

32:50.113 --> 32:53.280
I'm just asking because I find it odd

32:53.571 --> 32:56.778
that you're so concerned
about another person.

32:57.571 --> 32:58.778
She's a kid, John.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.777
Where is she? Please.

33:02.778 --> 33:04.196
Wonders never cease.

33:06.778 --> 33:08.777
May we go now?

33:08.778 --> 33:11.778
Or should I start the lawsuits immediately?

33:16.778 --> 33:19.777
Calista is fine, Christian.

33:19.778 --> 33:22.778
All she needs is a home and a family.

33:24.697 --> 33:26.697
You remember what that was like, don't you?

33:37.778 --> 33:39.778
Who killed Johnny Royalle?

33:41.778 --> 33:43.778
I suppose the truth is

33:44.778 --> 33:46.363
I killed Johnny Royalle.

33:46.613 --> 33:47.777
Why?

33:47.778 --> 33:50.778
Because I couldn't live
with him any longer.

33:50.778 --> 33:54.405
Let's not be coy now.
You are Johnny Royalle.

33:54.655 --> 33:56.359
So, what? You couldn't live with the fact

33:56.359 --> 33:57.739
that you broke Wolfe out of the Shaft,

33:57.778 --> 33:59.091
and he killed hundreds of people?

33:59.092 --> 34:01.777
I did not break Wolfe out of the Shaft.

34:01.778 --> 34:03.777
Wolfe literally disappeared from his cell,

34:03.778 --> 34:07.777
and it is common knowledge that
you were his chief disciple.

34:07.778 --> 34:09.777
I was a student of Wolfe's.

34:09.777 --> 34:12.777
Myself, several other young Powers,

34:12.777 --> 34:16.071
were taken by his philosophy
of Powers Complete.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.779
This man in whom I placed my trust,

34:19.071 --> 34:21.777
whom I loved,

34:23.777 --> 34:28.405
he killed, literally ate,
all of my closest friends.

34:28.655 --> 34:31.112
I did not break him out.

34:31.405 --> 34:34.777
Well, if you're not guilty,
then why kill Johnny Royalle?

34:34.777 --> 34:37.550
Your DNA was found amongst
the remains at the terrace.

34:37.550 --> 34:39.212
Why fake your own death?

34:39.777 --> 34:42.446
In the face of universal loathing,

34:42.737 --> 34:44.446
who wouldn't want to be Johnny Royalle?

34:44.737 --> 34:47.777
In the face of universal
loathing, why resurrect him?

34:47.777 --> 34:50.777
This city is my home.
I wanted to come home.

34:50.777 --> 34:52.777
I wanted to make something here.

34:52.777 --> 34:55.777
A house of sorts. A safe place.

34:55.777 --> 34:57.777
A celebration, if you will.

34:57.778 --> 34:59.778
Your resistance to Powers registration

34:59.988 --> 35:01.777
landed you in the Shaft yourself.

35:01.778 --> 35:03.777
- A political prisoner.
- So, will you register?

35:03.778 --> 35:05.777
Just because you disagree with a law,

35:05.778 --> 35:08.777
doesn't mean you get to ignore it.

35:08.778 --> 35:10.777
I'll be registering today.

35:10.778 --> 35:12.777
Johnny Royalle did in fact register

35:12.778 --> 35:15.778
his powers shortly after this interview.

35:15.904 --> 35:19.446
And here's a look at the
reception he received.

35:21.778 --> 35:24.777
I'm here to register my
powers as law demands.

35:24.778 --> 35:28.655
I am not using my powers
to defend myself or flee...

35:29.778 --> 35:31.530
- Will you stop it?
- Okay, okay.

35:31.778 --> 35:33.778
So, when is he gonna
make his move for Wolfe?

35:36.405 --> 35:37.778
He should have done it already.

35:38.778 --> 35:40.862
None of this publicity shit.

35:46.904 --> 35:50.778
He's planning something.
I just... I can't...

35:52.446 --> 35:54.777
Fuck this cop shit.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.777
Give me something I can hit.

35:56.778 --> 35:59.778
I'm gonna ask you a question.

35:59.778 --> 36:00.778
- Can you for once...
- Did you know?

36:00.779 --> 36:01.778
- ... just not...
- No.

36:01.946 --> 36:03.777
When you jumped,

36:03.778 --> 36:06.821
did you know Retro Girl was gonna save you?

36:08.778 --> 36:10.862
Yes, I knew.

36:12.778 --> 36:13.862
I did.

36:14.154 --> 36:15.778
I knew because

36:17.778 --> 36:20.738
- she was gonna be on patrol...
- Mmm-hmm.

36:20.778 --> 36:22.777
Because the lords and the outlaws

36:22.778 --> 36:24.778
had been on her turf that morning.

36:26.778 --> 36:28.738
I knew because...

36:34.778 --> 36:36.777
Fuck you.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.778
I don't know what I knew, okay.

36:40.988 --> 36:42.778
Calista jumped.

36:43.778 --> 36:44.777
I went after her.

36:44.778 --> 36:47.777
It was a stupid fucking thing to do, okay.

36:47.778 --> 36:50.777
I don't have powers anymore. I'm
not a hero. Thank you, I know.

36:50.778 --> 36:52.777
No! That shit... You know what I think?

36:52.778 --> 36:55.777
That shit, that jump off a
building and save a kid shit,

36:55.778 --> 36:59.446
that's not because you were a
Power, that's because you're you.

36:59.738 --> 37:02.777
You can learn the cop shit, Walker.

37:02.778 --> 37:04.778
Oh.

37:06.778 --> 37:09.071
Mmm.

37:09.363 --> 37:12.777
It's Dr. Death. Dead naked
guy's name was Gomez Pugh.

37:12.778 --> 37:14.777
If you can believe it.

37:14.778 --> 37:17.697
The Power. Went by the handle...

37:17.778 --> 37:18.777
Yeah. Bug.

37:18.778 --> 37:21.280
That's him.

37:21.571 --> 37:23.492
You know what Dr. Death found in his DNA?

37:24.778 --> 37:25.778
Little red corkscrews?

37:26.029 --> 37:27.904
- Just like Olympia.
- Yeah.

37:30.196 --> 37:31.777
Royalle.

37:31.778 --> 37:33.779
It's gotta be. Oh, it's gotta be Royalle.

37:35.778 --> 37:36.777
What is he doing?

37:36.778 --> 37:38.946
It's gonna take some cop
shit to figure it out.

37:39.196 --> 37:40.778
Yeah.

37:45.778 --> 37:48.778
Don't get used to it. I'm
not your personal assistant.

37:50.778 --> 37:51.778
Tell me about Zerotron-X.

37:55.778 --> 37:57.778
- I charged in.
- No, no.

37:58.778 --> 38:01.571
Rookie mistake. Rookie mistake.

38:01.778 --> 38:02.777
What?

38:02.778 --> 38:04.777
That... you made yourself
into a lightning rod.

38:04.778 --> 38:06.777
Okay.

38:06.778 --> 38:11.278
See, lightning has multiple
targets, splits out...

38:26.778 --> 38:28.405
All right!

38:33.778 --> 38:34.904
Sweet, thanks.

38:48.238 --> 38:50.778
Ladies and Gentlemen, the mysterious

38:50.821 --> 38:53.821
owner of the Here and Gone club,

38:54.113 --> 38:56.778
Johnny Royalle.

39:33.778 --> 39:34.778
So you found me.

39:37.778 --> 39:40.777
You were easy to find.

39:40.778 --> 39:44.778
You're all over the internet.
You're Johnny Royalle. You're famous.

39:47.778 --> 39:49.778
And yet, I'm still myself.

39:50.778 --> 39:52.778
So, where did you run to?

39:54.778 --> 39:56.777
I did something stupid,

39:56.778 --> 39:59.238
and, um... Retro Girl saved me.

40:03.778 --> 40:05.778
So you met your hero, hmm?

40:06.778 --> 40:08.778
What did you think of her?

40:09.862 --> 40:12.697
I trusted her.

40:12.778 --> 40:15.446
She said she would hide me, but she lied.

40:15.738 --> 40:17.778
She was gonna give me to the cops.

40:24.778 --> 40:26.071
Do you trust me?

40:27.363 --> 40:28.778
Did you kill Bug?

40:41.778 --> 40:43.697
This place,

40:45.446 --> 40:47.446
no one knows where it is.

40:48.778 --> 40:50.321
Not even Simons.

40:52.778 --> 40:53.778
We are invisible.

41:05.778 --> 41:07.530
I killed Bug.

41:09.778 --> 41:12.778
I killed him, in part,
because he misused you.

41:14.778 --> 41:16.778
This is my signed confession.

41:18.778 --> 41:20.777
If I ever betray your trust,

41:20.778 --> 41:22.778
you take this to Walker.

41:25.778 --> 41:27.778
I put my freedom in your hands.

41:52.778 --> 41:55.777
Let's go back to the party.

41:55.778 --> 41:57.738
I'll show you your new home.

42:00.778 --> 42:02.777
Hey, it's me.

42:02.778 --> 42:04.778
Call me when you get a chance.

42:05.778 --> 42:07.778
Hey, it's me again, um.

42:07.821 --> 42:10.778
I'm calling about the girl and Royalle.

42:10.778 --> 42:13.988
And that's why I called.

42:14.238 --> 42:18.405
Hi, it's me again. Call
me if you find the girl.

42:18.697 --> 42:21.154
And that's it, okay.

43:26.280 --> 43:27.778
What the fuck?

43:30.778 --> 43:33.777
Can't an old friend pop by?

43:33.778 --> 43:35.154
The fuck you playing at, Johnny?

43:35.778 --> 43:38.613
What game is this?

43:38.778 --> 43:42.778
Just wanted to tell you
I would never hurt you.

43:44.613 --> 43:45.778
Never.

43:50.071 --> 43:53.778
As long as you stay the fuck out of my way.
