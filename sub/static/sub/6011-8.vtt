00:38.360 --> 00:41.637
- I assume Drewe knows we're coming.
- Yes, I sent the note yesterday.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.394
So, have the pigs recovered,
do you think?

00:47.920 --> 00:49.559
They look in good shape to me,

00:49.680 --> 00:51.672
after the shock of
their arrival.

00:52.040 --> 00:53.793
Well, why didn't he check to
see they'd all had water

00:53.920 --> 00:54.990
before he left for the night?

00:55.280 --> 00:56.873
Maybe he filled the trough
and thought that was enough.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.792
He wasn't to know they'd kick it over.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.236
Mr Branson is right.
He should have made sure.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.390
You would have done.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.236
Where did you learn about pigs?

01:04.319 --> 01:06.437
DREWE: We've always had pigs
at Yew Tree, m'lady.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.552
Not many, but enough
to learn their ways.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.598
Thank heavens you did.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.754
So, have you found
a man to take over?

01:15.840 --> 01:17.035
Not yet.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.599
First, we'd like to know if you'd want the job.

01:21.680 --> 01:26.038
Me? You mean I'm to manage the pigs
for the estate, as well as me farm?

01:26.240 --> 01:27.515
It's asking a lot.

01:28.360 --> 01:29.714
I can do it.

01:30.520 --> 01:34.036
- If you're sure?
- Let's give it a try, see how we get on.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.193
I'm very grateful, m'lady.

01:37.160 --> 01:40.073
This is the second good turn
I've received from your family,

01:40.160 --> 01:43.073
and I just hope I can
pay back a favour one day.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.759
How nice of you.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.958
I don't know if it's much of a favour.
We're giving you a lot of work.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.272
Work's like old age, m'lady.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.671
The worst thing in the world,
except for the alternative.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.753
It's only me.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.995
I always feel that greeting
betrays such a lack of self-worth.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.835
How are we today?

02:10.400 --> 02:15.031
My dear, please stop talking to me
as if I were a child past hope.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.830
- Very well. How are you feeling?
- Like Dr Manette.

02:19.360 --> 02:23.593
If I don't get out of this house soon, I shall
remember nothing but my number.

02:23.920 --> 02:26.515
Then why don't we walk to
the Abbey this afternoon, if it's fine?

02:26.600 --> 02:28.637
Hear how Robert's getting on in America.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.440
Is it really called the Teapot Dome scandal?

02:31.560 --> 02:34.234
It seems so unlikely.
What's it about?

02:34.400 --> 02:38.235
What is it always about?
Bribery and corruption.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.032
Taking money to allow
private companies to

02:42.120 --> 02:45.397
drill for oil on
government land.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.437
And Mr Levinson has one
of these companies?

02:47.560 --> 02:49.153
I assume so.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.390
Have you ever met him?

02:50.480 --> 02:52.915
Once. At the wedding.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.799
And once was quite enough.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.917
I can't tell you how
thrilling that sounds.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.960
I'll be waiting for you.
We'll have such a lovely day.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.315
- Who was that?
- No one. Just a friend.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.676
By the way, you're going to have
to pull your weight with the bazaar.

03:08.760 --> 03:09.989
It seems to have crept up on me.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.879
- But does Cousin Robert usually do it?
- He does.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.514
The trouble is, half the village
hates the other half,

03:14.600 --> 03:18.310
and he's the only one who can stop
them tearing each other's throats out.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.951
I admire that. It's a real skill.

03:36.160 --> 03:42.236
Mr Molesley, is it true that you were a valet?
For the late Mr Crawley?

03:42.320 --> 03:44.880
And butler to his mother before that.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.954
I've come down in the world.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.037
You can climb up again.

03:49.720 --> 03:54.749
Maybe. But life kicks the stuffing
out of you sometimes, doesn't it?

03:55.160 --> 03:58.631
Oh, I've had my stuffing
kicked out more than once.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.150
I've woken and wondered
if there was any point to it.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.711
Yet here I am,
lady's maid to a countess.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.957
So it can happen.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.918
Now you've made me curious.

04:11.040 --> 04:14.477
I'm curious about something
and you could help me.

04:15.520 --> 04:20.151
Do you know if Mr and Mrs Bates
have had a falling out?

04:20.240 --> 04:23.711
Mr and Mrs Bates?
That doesn't sound very likely.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.630
Can I ask you to put that machine away?
We'll be laying for tea in a minute.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.710
Of course.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.871
- Is everything ready for the servants' tea?
- Yes, Mrs Patmore.

04:34.360 --> 04:37.831
Is it just me or do we have
twice the bills we used to?

04:38.120 --> 04:39.679
Ivy, this is for you.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.990
Did you find those
oyster shells for the kettle?

04:44.080 --> 04:46.754
I've put them in.
About time. It were full of scale.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.792
What in God's name was that about?

04:53.960 --> 04:58.477
Don't rise to it. She just wants
us to think her life's interesting.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.600
- Anything interesting?
- I'm reading about county politics.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.320
They're looking for candidates
for the local council.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.951
Why don't you
put yourself forward?

05:10.040 --> 05:13.511
But what are my politics
these days? I'm not sure.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.233
You could always
read a bit about it?

05:16.400 --> 05:19.632
You won't find many books
on the liberal ideals in this room.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.159
And nothing at all about socialism.

05:23.280 --> 05:27.593
If you're serious about driving me to Thirsk
tomorrow, perhaps we might find some then.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.638
Are you better now, Granny?

05:32.560 --> 05:35.029
If you'd been to see me, you'd know.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.791
Don't bully me. I'm not up to it.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.190
No. Rosamund told me.

05:42.040 --> 05:45.112
When? What did she say?

05:45.600 --> 05:48.638
Only that you needed
a little cherishing, that's all.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.597
CHARLES: So Mr Drewe
has accepted your offer?

05:51.680 --> 05:53.273
MARY: I'm so pleased.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.920
The Drewes have been at
Yew Tree Farm for many years.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.834
I suppose you think
that's sentimental bosh, Mr Blake.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.270
Don't be too hard on him, Granny.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.313
Mr Blake has a softer side
than we first gave him credit for.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.871
I'm relieved to hear I am
redeemed before we leave for London.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.315
I hope I'm forgiven, too.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.318
I know you thought me
very snobbish when you first arrived.

06:13.920 --> 06:18.312
I don't blame you. Given my work,
I came as an envoy of the enemy.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.714
Oh, are we too early?

06:20.800 --> 06:24.157
Bring them in, Nanny.
I don't think anyone will mind.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.391
Your Papa might, but he
isn't here to complain.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.837
One moment, darling,
while Mummy puts away her cup.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.718
Here, let me. Hello there.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.233
Oh, it's all right.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.433
He's turning into quite a bruiser.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.750
Yes, well, I must go.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.912
Stay and have some dinner, Mama.
You needn't change.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.555
No, no. Thank you, my dear, but no.

06:44.760 --> 06:48.231
You should change and I should go.

06:52.520 --> 06:55.399
When you go down, can you
give a message to Mrs Hughes?

06:55.640 --> 06:56.994
Of course.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.471
Lord Gillingham telephoned today.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.316
He wants to break his journey home.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.312
Tomorrow night.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.280
He'll be here again?

07:07.400 --> 07:10.871
You're right. I shouldn't encourage him,

07:11.000 --> 07:14.789
but I couldn't think what to
say to persuade him not to.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.992
Do you think me very feeble?

07:20.320 --> 07:22.073
It's not that, m'lady.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.869
Then what is it?

07:28.720 --> 07:29.790
Anna?

07:31.160 --> 07:32.560
It's nothing to bother you with.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.000
Please bother me.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.352
If I did, you'd have to
promise to do nothing about it.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.236
But how does this concern Lord Gillingham?

07:45.520 --> 07:49.594
It doesn't, m'lady. It's nothing to do
with Lord Gillingham himself.

07:49.680 --> 07:50.716
But then...

07:50.800 --> 07:52.951
It's his man, m'lady. His servant,

07:54.280 --> 07:56.920
Mr Green, who travels with him.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.352
Oh, my God.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.838
- But the police ought to...
- No!

08:06.920 --> 08:08.149
I must tell Lord Gillingham.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.600
No, m'lady, you promised.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.632
Mr Bates doesn't know it was him.

08:11.720 --> 08:16.272
But the more he comes here, the more
likely it is that Mr Bates will find out.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.596
Then I'll telephone him and
tell him not to come,

08:18.760 --> 08:19.876
or not to bring Green.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.919
I'm frightened every time Mr Green
and Mr Bates are in the same room.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.594
You think, if he guesses,
he'll do something.

08:28.160 --> 08:32.837
And if he does, they'll hang him.
Or lock him up and throw away the key.

08:32.960 --> 08:37.796
Jimmy, the savouries can go in
and Daisy'll bring up the sauce.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.073
And now perhaps you can explain why

08:42.159 --> 08:45.278
you have apparently been under
hypnosis since dinner began.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.919
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.471
Mooning about like a sloth underwater.

08:50.720 --> 08:54.191
- Well?
- You know I had a letter earlier?

08:54.280 --> 08:55.714
It were from Alfred.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.391
It seems his father died and Alfred's coming
up to Yorkshire for the funeral.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.039
Oh, I am sorry.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.800
That's not all. He says
he wants to marry me.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.470
What? Just like that?

09:06.600 --> 09:08.512
He says the way I behaved towards him
when he was last here

09:08.600 --> 09:10.876
made him hope that things
had changed between us.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.832
Well, you were very friendly.

09:13.040 --> 09:16.716
That's not all. He wants me to leave Downton
and go up to London.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.400
He says he can find me a job.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.672
Blimey. He puts a lot in
a letter, does Alfred.

09:21.760 --> 09:22.796
They're serving the savouries.

09:22.880 --> 09:23.916
We'll talk about it later.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.158
Now, put the water on for the coffee.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.950
That's enough for one day, surely.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.239
You can finish them tomorrow.

09:41.720 --> 09:45.509
Shall we walk back to the cottage?
The others are going to bed.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.955
What were you saying to Mrs Hughes?

09:47.600 --> 09:50.752
Just that Lord Gillingham's
asked himself for the night again.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.519
He can't stay away.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.791
Yes. It's a bit of a tangle.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.713
Do you think she's sweet on him?

09:58.840 --> 10:02.311
They're sweet on each other,
but it's not as simple as that, is it?

10:03.720 --> 10:04.949
Then there's Mr Blake.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.556
I thought she didn't like him.

10:07.680 --> 10:11.151
She didn't. At first.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.311
Anyway, they can sort it out between them.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.397
And Mr Green.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.031
He'll be coming back.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.231
- Have you gone off him?
- Why do you say that?

10:30.640 --> 10:33.439
You liked him so much when he first came.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.513
You thought he was funny.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.071
Did I? I can't remember.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.999
So, you're pleased with Mr Drewe?

10:45.320 --> 10:48.552
I am. And I'm very pleased with the pigs, too.
They're a grand addition.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.472
When they've settled in,
you ought to consider dairy.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.633
Another job for the splendid Mr Drewe.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.558
I think he is rather splendid.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.714
He seems to want to make
farming at Downton his life's work.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.439
That's very lyrical.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.758
Lady Rosamund Painswick
is on the telephone, m'lady.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.119
Do you have anything planned for today?

11:11.120 --> 11:13.760
Um, some shopping. That's all.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.520
Do you think I should
write and give him my answer?

11:16.600 --> 11:17.829
If you're sure about it.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.718
I don't want to marry Alfred.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.035
Then there's no more to be said.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.238
Even if I did, I wouldn't care
to tie myself down yet.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.559
How do I know what life has in store?

11:27.080 --> 11:30.118
You're a very optimistic generation.
I'll say that.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.230
What are you talking about?

11:31.320 --> 11:32.390
Nothing.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.791
I wish you'd say, 'cause it's clear
as day you're up to something.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.310
None of us know when
Papa's coming back.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.871
But, yes, we must tell her before then.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.231
In fact, I've had an idea.

11:47.200 --> 11:52.639
Well, if you're sure, then why not?
We've already got friends of Mary staying.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.757
Ring with the train time.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.590
Who was that?

11:57.680 --> 12:00.320
Aunt Rosamund.
She's coming to see how Granny is.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.474
Why are you down so early?

12:02.560 --> 12:06.031
I've got to check some figures with Tom
before he goes into Thirsk.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.319
Quite the businesswoman.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.834
We must rise to life's challenges.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.231
Yes, I suppose we must.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.479
Let's meet in the bookshop in ten minutes.
I've got some letters to post.

12:21.560 --> 12:22.630
I'll see you there.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.154
Thank you.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.320
Good day.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.150
Don't, don't do that.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.152
You mustn't be so self-conscious.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.597
A black singer with the daughter
of a marquess in a north Yorkshire town?

13:07.560 --> 13:09.074
Why should we attract any attention?

13:09.200 --> 13:11.840
Well, that's their problem.
It doesn't have to be ours.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.273
I'm terribly puffed that you made the journey.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.192
Me too, but...

13:20.320 --> 13:21.356
But what?

13:21.440 --> 13:22.920
I hope we're brave enough for this.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.360
Of course we are!

13:24.480 --> 13:27.473
Isn't it time people knew that there are
bigger and better values than

13:27.560 --> 13:29.392
the mean-spirited ones they live by?

13:29.480 --> 13:31.358
Does Lady Grantham know
you're out for the day?

13:31.440 --> 13:34.831
I'll telephone, but it won't matter
as long as I'm back for dinner.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.430
Are you playing tonight?

13:37.680 --> 13:38.750
I wouldn't be here if I were.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.232
So I can stay for as long as you want.

13:41.360 --> 13:44.990
Well, I want you to stay forever,
but 6:00 will do.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.391
ISOBEL: You're not very talkative.
What's the matter?

13:50.480 --> 13:52.915
I was thinking about a couple of people
who are in a situation

13:53.040 --> 13:54.679
which is going to cause trouble.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.712
Will it make them unhappy?

13:58.560 --> 14:00.040
That's hard to say.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.792
It'll make some people unhappy.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.998
I thought I might make some coffee.
Would you like a cup?

14:06.440 --> 14:08.033
No, thank you.

14:08.480 --> 14:14.033
It's just coffee. You won't have to
surrender any of your independence.

14:16.560 --> 14:20.031
You win. Er, milk but no sugar.

14:22.120 --> 14:27.718
Miss Baxter, I do know
what it's like, to feel fragile.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.918
I've felt fragile my whole life.

14:34.480 --> 14:38.030
You'll have realised by now that,
down here, we don't much care for Mr Barrow,

14:38.440 --> 14:40.113
which may offend you.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.477
I'm not offended.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.071
But I wish you'd give us credit for
making up our own minds about you.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.280
Hello.

14:57.160 --> 15:01.200
- This is Miss...
- Bunting. Sarah Bunting.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.840
And this is Mrs Crawley.

15:02.920 --> 15:06.914
I met Miss Bunting at the political
meeting you sent me to. In Ripon.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.719
Ah. So that was the reason.

15:08.880 --> 15:09.870
Why do you say that?

15:09.960 --> 15:12.714
He wasn't exactly in thrall
to the cause of the Liberals.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.754
Though I'm not now
convinced by his socialism.

15:15.840 --> 15:16.910
Why not?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.832
I didn't know then that
you were the land agent

15:18.920 --> 15:21.480
and son-in-law of our local mi'lord.

15:21.680 --> 15:22.909
I'm surprised I'm so famous.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.919
Won't you defend your principles?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.957
No, not now.

15:27.280 --> 15:30.159
Then I will. Mr Branson
is a keen political thinker.

15:30.280 --> 15:33.591
He proves this by not being
afraid to question his own beliefs.

15:33.720 --> 15:38.078
Very eloquent. I'd stay to argue but I'm late.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.475
Do you live around here?

15:41.920 --> 15:44.879
I work here.
At the school.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.838
It was nice to see you again.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.994
CHILD: Hello, Miss!

15:52.040 --> 15:53.759
She knows her own mind.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.832
Yes, I think she does.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.915
Apparently he left the Dalrymples
straight after breakfast,

16:00.960 --> 16:04.078
so I missed him when I telephoned.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.278
You did your best.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.720
I'm so sorry.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.200
Come in.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.311
No tails? You know Granny's coming.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.517
Oh, God, is she?
I didn't realise.

16:18.600 --> 16:22.196
No, don't change. It's time
she learned about the real world.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.431
Well, that's a phrase with
more than one definition.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.115
Can I have a word?

16:33.200 --> 16:37.877
I've seen something, and I'm not saying
there's anything wrong about it, but

16:37.960 --> 16:39.997
I'd feel uncomfortable if I kept it to myself.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.113
I'm all ears.

16:42.280 --> 16:45.876
This morning in Thirsk, I saw Rose.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.829
Yes, she was shopping.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.991
No, she was not shopping.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.117
She was meeting a man.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.075
I saw her as she reached up
to stroke his cheek.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.791
Oh, golly. Who is it this time?

17:03.080 --> 17:04.309
It was Jack Ross,

17:04.760 --> 17:08.037
the singer with the band
who came up for your father's party.

17:08.240 --> 17:11.994
That's it. I've told you
and I have nothing more to add.

17:20.720 --> 17:21.915
Anna?

17:24.160 --> 17:26.196
She's told you, then?

17:26.359 --> 17:31.594
Don't give me away, Mrs Hughes, please.
I can get through it.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.476
My maid said you were waiting in here.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.036
Everyone else is in the drawing room.

17:39.240 --> 17:42.711
I know, but I thought you'd want to hear.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.789
I think I know how I can keep the baby.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.913
What? How?

17:49.400 --> 17:52.632
There's a tenant farmer, whose family
has been at Downton for years.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.833
I'm sure he can be trusted.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.033
This is very reckless.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.678
Well, what would you suggest?

18:02.160 --> 18:05.631
I'd suggest that we go away,

18:05.720 --> 18:10.112
you and me, on an
extended trip to somewhere.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.240
Then the baby can be adopted by
a childless couple in that country,

18:13.360 --> 18:17.434
wherever it may be, and they are made
very happy, and the baby is happy,

18:17.560 --> 18:22.954
and you are, well,
if not happy, at least free.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.394
But I wouldn't be part of its growing up?

18:26.600 --> 18:28.910
You wouldn't be part of its life.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.636
Why is my idea so reckless?

18:32.720 --> 18:34.757
Oh my dear, where shall I start?

18:34.920 --> 18:39.711
Suppose the farmer talks?
Suppose you're seen visiting his home,

18:39.840 --> 18:41.911
which I presume is the idea?

18:42.080 --> 18:45.551
Suppose the baby looks like you
and people in the village notice?

18:46.440 --> 18:47.954
Suppose you talk?

18:50.960 --> 18:53.919
I left a list somewhere
that I need for Mrs Patmore.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.912
You know Lord Gillingham is here?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.435
Er, yes. We were just chatting.
We're coming now.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.591
I'm desperately trying to
take control of the bazaar.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.151
Honestly. Talk about herding cats.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.674
I'll stay and help if you want.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.274
You may regret saying that.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.990
And while I'm here we can
discuss a plan that I'd like to get settled.

19:10.120 --> 19:14.592
I've always wanted to speak
better French than I do,

19:14.720 --> 19:16.837
so I thought I'd take a few months off,

19:16.920 --> 19:20.391
go to Switzerland and really learn it.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.479
I see. Not France?

19:23.600 --> 19:27.071
You know what the French are like.
While Switzerland is so clean.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.990
And they have wonderful hospitals.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.440
In case we get ill.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.590
We?

19:32.680 --> 19:35.240
I wondered if Edith might like to come.

19:35.320 --> 19:38.199
Keep me company. I'll pay.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.677
What do you have to say about that?

19:41.920 --> 19:45.038
- I'd like to.
- CORA: Goodness.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.398
Oh. Well. Why not?

19:48.640 --> 19:51.280
Golly, life is full of surprises.

19:51.360 --> 19:54.831
But right now I'd better check to see that
the young men are keeping the peace.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.272
So, we won't have to tell her?

20:03.400 --> 20:06.438
I don't think we need to, do you?

20:07.640 --> 20:12.999
Can you really afford to spend four months
reading novels in the Alps?

20:13.160 --> 20:16.039
Why ask the question when
the decision has been made?

20:16.880 --> 20:20.351
Come on, we ought to join the others.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.200
Have you been wandering
around Scotland since we saw you?

20:25.320 --> 20:27.880
I have. I was on the Spey.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.754
I did a tour of the cousinage,
and after that, a wedding in Ayrshire.

20:31.240 --> 20:34.438
I've enjoyed myself.
It gave me time to think for once.

20:34.520 --> 20:37.319
Oh, what about, particularly?

20:37.520 --> 20:38.590
My life, I suppose.

20:38.680 --> 20:41.149
Everyone should, from time to time.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.473
Oh, I can't agree. In my experience
it's a dangerous occupation.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.550
Dangerous?

20:46.640 --> 20:50.600
Well, no life appears rewarding
if you think too much about it.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.520
I gather you've launched into pigs these days.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.195
Yes. And their arrival
was quite the adventure,

20:56.600 --> 21:00.071
in which Mr Blake and Mary
were the hero and heroine.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.712
Is this what you wouldn't
tell me about when I was last here?

21:03.120 --> 21:05.874
Only because I didn't
want to make too much of it.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.229
Lady Mary was perfectly splendid.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.597
Lady Mary is perfectly splendid.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.315
Really, Charles. Are you a pig expert, as well?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.835
He was that night, thank heaven.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.993
Rosamund and Edith have
some exciting news.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.110
Oh, what's that?

21:19.200 --> 21:22.272
We're going on a sabbatical
so that we can really improve our French.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.154
The only thing I ever learned from
my governess was how to say,

21:25.240 --> 21:27.960
"Please", "Thank you," and
"I have a temperature."

21:28.080 --> 21:30.800
Very useful if one were travelling.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.554
Do you remember her, Mama?
She was always in tears.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.074
Oh, poor Mademoiselle.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.516
Her life was full of

21:39.080 --> 21:41.356
I think she quite enjoyed it, though.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.312
But why you? You don't
want to learn French.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.837
Or is this an incognito search
for the missing Mr Gregson?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.879
Don't tease her.
It's much more serious than that.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.673
Thank you, Tom.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.673
If you must know, I fancy
getting away for a bit.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.114
Like Lord Gillingham,

21:57.720 --> 22:00.189
thinking his way round
the Highlands.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.158
I like Scotland, me. At least,
I would if I'd ever been there.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.357
Well, I've had a bellyful
of heather and no mistake.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.154
Aren't you going to fight back, Mrs Hughes?

22:11.440 --> 22:13.397
Mr Green can think what he likes.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.595
So you're glad you're on your way to London?

22:18.680 --> 22:21.991
It'll be all I can do to stop singing
when I get in the car.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.673
Where do you live when you're there?

22:24.160 --> 22:26.038
His lordship's got a set at Albany.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.760
JAMES: Is that handy for the West End?

22:27.840 --> 22:30.799
You're joking. Piccadilly one end,
Savile Row the other.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.798
- Oh, you lucky tyke.
- I am a lucky tyke.

22:33.640 --> 22:36.030
Do you like London, Miss Baxter?

22:36.120 --> 22:40.433
Not particularly. I lived there at one time
but it didn't work for me.

22:40.520 --> 22:43.479
What about you, Anna?
Do you fancy a taste of Mr Green's life?

22:44.160 --> 22:46.072
I'm happy where I am, thank you.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.313
Rose was badgering me about
going up to London again,

22:52.440 --> 22:55.000
but she's been enough lately,
don't you think?

22:55.240 --> 22:56.390
I certainly do.

22:56.480 --> 22:59.279
After all, she's got to have some novelty
when we bring her out.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.638
- Quite right.
- She can help with the bazaar.

23:03.320 --> 23:06.518
That'll take her mind off things.

23:06.600 --> 23:10.753
The trouble is parenting an adult,
especially when it's someone else's daughter,

23:10.960 --> 23:13.191
is really a matter of mutual agreement.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.870
There's a limit to how much one
can simply forbid.

23:15.960 --> 23:19.749
Ssh. Here she is.
Actually, I want a word with her.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.232
Rose, darling. Can I drag you into my room
for a moment?

23:28.760 --> 23:31.116
- Anna, could you leave us for a minute?
- Of course.

23:35.240 --> 23:39.120
- This is early for you to go to bed.
- I had rather a tiring day.

23:39.600 --> 23:43.674
So I heard. Well, I heard you had an
interesting day.

23:44.720 --> 23:48.270
Whether or not it was tiring,
you know better than I.

23:50.440 --> 23:51.430
Who told you?

23:51.520 --> 23:55.355
My dear, all I want is for you
not to lose control of your life.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.794
I love him.

23:57.520 --> 24:02.515
And I won't listen to any
imperialist nonsense about racial purity

24:02.600 --> 24:04.876
and how he should be horsewhipped
for daring to dream.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.879
Don't you know me better than that?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.514
I'm going to marry him, Mary.

24:09.240 --> 24:13.553
I don't care what it costs and I won't keep
it a secret. Not once I've told Mummy.

24:13.640 --> 24:16.439
I want to see her face crumble
when she finds out.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.156
Rose!

24:28.320 --> 24:29.913
I feel we're driving you away.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.038
Oh, hardly. We were in grave danger
of outstaying our welcome.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.794
If Tony hadn't offered us a lift home we'd
probably be here forever.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.155
Well, I hope you'll be back soon.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.709
- Good luck with your bazaar.
- Can't you stay and lend me a hand?

24:40.680 --> 24:42.717
Don't tempt me.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.757
I'm so grateful for your advice and wisdom.

24:44.840 --> 24:47.878
And not least for the very practical
and muddy pig rescue.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.518
Glad to be of service, m'lady.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.673
TOM: Are you going straight there?
CHARLES: We might stop for some lunch.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.558
It's kind of you to give them a lift.

24:59.640 --> 25:03.429
Pure self-interest. I couldn't leave Charles
here, alone with you.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.671
Will you let me see you
when you're next down south?

25:09.240 --> 25:11.436
What would be the point, Tony?

25:12.520 --> 25:16.116
I'm never going to be your mistress.
That's not me at all.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.796
I've made up my mind to call off
the engagement.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.795
Does Mabel know?

25:22.880 --> 25:27.432
Not yet. I haven't been in London since.
And I must tell her face to face.

25:27.840 --> 25:32.198
Of course you must, but I wish you'd think
seriously before you do.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.711
You mean you're going to
turn me down again.

25:35.200 --> 25:40.480
I've told you I'm not on the market, Tony.
I'm not free.

25:41.440 --> 25:47.755
Sometimes I almost wish I were, but I'm not.
And that's all there is to it.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.999
Well, you have been incredibly kind to put up
with us for so long.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.800
We'll miss you.
The house will seem rather empty.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.992
If it were my choice,
I should never be away from here.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.551
Can I ask you one thing? How do you feel
about your man?

26:03.040 --> 26:05.555
I'm still not very keen on him. Why?

26:08.280 --> 26:11.637
We'd better get started.
So this really is goodbye.

26:11.720 --> 26:12.870
Not for long, I hope.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.799
You took the words right out of my mouth.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.599
I'm sorry to see them go.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.559
Not as sorry as Mary.
What's a group noun for suitors?

26:40.040 --> 26:41.599
What do you think? A desire?

26:41.680 --> 26:44.240
"A desire of suitors." Very good.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.832
If you're going to talk nonsense,
I have better things to do.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.280
- I've posted the letter.
- Well, he'll probably still come.

26:57.360 --> 27:00.114
He's got to be in Yorkshire for the funeral,
whatever you've said.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.475
Whatever she said to who?

27:04.200 --> 27:07.352
Oh, just tell me. I know you've got a secret

27:07.440 --> 27:10.239
and if you're trying to spare my feelings
it's not working.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.712
Alfred's written. His father's died
so he's coming for the burial.

27:14.640 --> 27:17.474
- He wants to look in and see us all.
- "See us all," or see her?

27:18.800 --> 27:22.157
- Alfred's asked me to marry him.
- But she's turned him down.

27:22.440 --> 27:26.150
So his heart's broken properly, this time.
Are you satisfied now?

27:26.240 --> 27:29.074
Why don't we leave the subject there?
We don't want to fall out.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.959
We can't fall out. We've never fallen in.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.231
So they got off in good order.

27:40.320 --> 27:43.279
I wonder how long it'll take for them all to
propose to Mary.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.557
Isn't Lord Gillingham engaged?

27:45.640 --> 27:49.919
He's supposed to be, but he still seems
as keen as mustard.

27:50.960 --> 27:56.035
Well, that is very interesting.
But it's not why I asked you here.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.559
- Oh?
- COUNTESS: No.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.835
I want to know what
you were doing at Downton.

28:02.920 --> 28:07.472
I don't understand. Why shouldn't I come to
Downton? I grew up here.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.314
I see. I have to take the slow path.

28:12.280 --> 28:15.796
You telephone to say
Edith is to be cherished.

28:17.360 --> 28:18.840
But you don't say why.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.150
Didn't I?

28:20.240 --> 28:26.271
No. Next, you invite yourself to Downton
and reveal at dinner that you and Edith are

28:26.360 --> 28:32.596
retreating to the continent for several
months so you can improve your French.

28:33.440 --> 28:34.430
EDITH: Yes.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.436
Rosamund has no interest in French.

28:38.720 --> 28:42.430
If she wishes to be understood by
a foreigner, she shouts.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.190
That's not fair.

28:46.040 --> 28:48.919
Isn't it time one of you told me the truth?

28:54.760 --> 28:57.594
If I told you the truth, Granny, you would
never speak to me again.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.959
Then you have told me the truth,

29:01.840 --> 29:05.072
but I would like to hear it
enunciated more clearly.

29:06.360 --> 29:10.752
Right. Now we must all look lively.
They're starting to set up the stalls

29:10.840 --> 29:13.912
for the bazaar today and her ladyship
is going to need all hands on deck.

29:14.480 --> 29:17.314
James, Mr Molesley, if you
could both keep an eye on things.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.791
- Do we get paid extra?
- No, but if you play your cards right,

29:20.880 --> 29:22.439
you'll avoid a clip round the ear.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.110
I'll ask Mrs Patmore for some refreshment
for the village people.

29:27.160 --> 29:30.437
This is an early warning that they're coming
to set up the stalls for Saturday,

29:30.520 --> 29:33.035
so we'd better have sandwiches and beer
at the ready.

29:33.520 --> 29:37.958
As I feared. Alfred's looking in on Saturday
on his way back to London.

29:38.760 --> 29:41.514
So he'll be here for the bazaar.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.755
He does know there's no hope with Ivy?

29:46.840 --> 29:49.674
That's why he's written to me.
But he says he wants to see her.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.310
It's not going to be very easy for Daisy.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.716
I thought I'd give her the day off.
You won't mind, will you?

29:55.320 --> 29:59.280
If you think it best. It's you
who'll do the extra work, not me.

30:00.720 --> 30:04.953
What a nightmare. The man selling ices
is ill, so I've got to find another.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.715
The grocers from Easingwold and Malton
can't be side by side,

30:07.800 --> 30:10.952
and now I've got to decide
the house menus with Mrs Patmore.

30:11.400 --> 30:14.598
- I'll do that. Tend to the bazaar.
- Are you sure? Because if you are...

30:14.680 --> 30:15.955
I'm sure.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.559
- When's Cousin Robert coming back?
- I don't know. I wish I did.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.996
We've had no word from him in days.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.194
What is it?

30:33.520 --> 30:36.080
I've got to tell someone,
or I'll just explode.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.994
- Tell someone what?
- Oh, Mary.

30:40.560 --> 30:43.758
What do you think?
I'm engaged.

30:45.920 --> 30:46.990
But what was so urgent?

30:47.960 --> 30:51.397
First, can you join me for luncheon today?

30:52.320 --> 30:56.314
I suppose so. I ought to go back and tell
Mrs Field. Why?

30:56.400 --> 30:58.073
I've got Lord Merton coming.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.030
Mary's godfather?

31:00.120 --> 31:04.399
Hmm, it was fixed years ago, but now Robert's
off on his travels,

31:04.480 --> 31:08.759
Cora's too busy and
Mary's chucked.

31:08.840 --> 31:12.834
- For what reason?
- Suddenly she has to be in London.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.474
I think Rosamund's still here.

31:14.560 --> 31:17.120
Oh no, she can't stand him.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.111
I could ask Edith. She might be free.

31:20.200 --> 31:24.114
Oh I hope so. I'm a feeble substitute for
the entire Crawley family.

31:24.200 --> 31:27.034
Mm, yes, but you're better than nothing.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.277
How warming you make that sound.

31:31.560 --> 31:34.439
I'm ever so glad to find you.
Can you help me do these?

31:35.280 --> 31:36.270
What's the rush?

31:36.680 --> 31:38.911
Lady Mary has to go to London.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.073
- Why?
- I'm not sure.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.230
But she wants me to go with her.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.079
Of course.

31:45.760 --> 31:49.356
- When will you be back?
- Tomorrow evening, but we'll be late.

31:52.240 --> 31:56.917
It's not fair. I stop you going to New York
then I set off for London.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.559
Don't be silly.

32:07.160 --> 32:11.791
- Come in.
- Mr Carson, I'd like to go into York tomorrow.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.234
I hope you don't mind.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.915
You've got no duties here.
Why should I mind?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.674
I'll make a day of it and set off first thing,
if you've no objection.

32:18.960 --> 32:23.432
Be my guest, Mr Bates. I still don't
understand why you're not in New York,

32:23.520 --> 32:27.036
so I can hardly object to York. Enjoy yourself.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.000
Very good. Well done, ladies.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.914
Can I have a go?

32:50.360 --> 32:53.239
It's not ready yet. Anyway, you're a bit of
a shrimp, aren't you?

32:53.320 --> 32:54.549
I'm a shrimp with muscles, me.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.432
We'll find that out on Saturday.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.000
I've never had a go on one of those.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.719
It's not your sort of thing.

33:00.920 --> 33:04.231
- More sandwiches, more beer.
- They're like a plague of locusts.

33:04.320 --> 33:07.552
- Keeping busy, Mr Molesley?
- Oh, I like the bazaar. I always enjoy it.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.275
- I hope you will.
- Can't you help her to, Mr Molesley?

33:10.360 --> 33:12.670
Oh, get off with you, you cheeky devil.

33:16.440 --> 33:19.035
Alfred's coming Saturday, ain't he?

33:19.520 --> 33:21.034
How do you know that?

33:21.120 --> 33:23.077
I heard you and Mrs Hughes talking.

33:23.160 --> 33:26.995
Well, I were going to mention it, because
I wondered if you'd rather be away.

33:27.920 --> 33:28.910
What about all the work?

33:29.120 --> 33:34.275
Oh, it's mostly done by then.
If you'd rather avoid him, I won't mind.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.189
Could I go and see Mr Mason?

33:36.280 --> 33:41.230
That's a good idea. Stay away
as late as you like. Just to be safe.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.273
CORA: But why the urgency?

33:45.360 --> 33:48.159
I can't explain, but I swear if you knew,
you'd approve.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.600
- What's this? What's happened?
- Mary has to go to London.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.797
It's no big thing.
I'll be back tomorrow night.

33:53.920 --> 33:55.274
- Can I come?
- No.

33:55.920 --> 33:56.910
But why not?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.992
Because Mama needs you here.
Goodbye, then.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.030
Bye, Rose.

34:00.875 --> 34:03.231
Do you want to stay at the house?
I'll telephone if you do.

34:03.315 --> 34:04.305
Could you? You're an angel.

34:04.555 --> 34:07.150
I'm afraid I've told Mead he could visit
his sister in Swindon,

34:07.235 --> 34:08.510
but they'll do the best
they can.

34:08.594 --> 34:09.915
Thank you.

34:11.875 --> 34:12.945
How mysterious.

34:31.995 --> 34:33.145
Is anything wrong?

34:33.235 --> 34:35.545
The car's packed in. My friend's gone for help.

34:35.635 --> 34:36.784
Would you like me to have a look?

34:36.915 --> 34:38.315
I don't want to hold you up.

34:38.594 --> 34:39.824
I've no appointment.

34:39.915 --> 34:43.955
I was just on my way to Skipton to see
some suppliers and compare prices.

34:44.635 --> 34:49.551
How impressive. I thought that when
the agent was a cousin or a son-in-law,

34:49.635 --> 34:52.355
he had free shooting for life,
but others did the work.

34:53.635 --> 34:57.150
To quote my wife's grandmother, you've been
reading those socialist newspapers again.

35:03.275 --> 35:04.265
Is this wise?

35:05.195 --> 35:10.315
You've heard some of my story, but not all
of it. I came to Downton to be the chauffeur.

35:10.955 --> 35:12.150
Now...

35:16.275 --> 35:20.315
That was a splendid luncheon.
Quite a change for me.

35:20.395 --> 35:22.387
Oh, I can't believe that.

35:22.475 --> 35:26.151
- It's true. I eat nothing but nursery food.
-

35:26.235 --> 35:27.271
Perhaps you need a new cook.

35:27.355 --> 35:30.154
Oh, it's not her fault.
I never know what to order.

35:30.235 --> 35:33.546
A husband is told so often
he's going to die first,

35:33.635 --> 35:35.547
you never think you're going
to have to manage on your own.

35:36.075 --> 35:38.874
I doubt Dr Crawley
would have managed any better.

35:39.115 --> 35:42.904
I'm so interested he was a doctor. I always
wanted to study medicine, myself,

35:43.075 --> 35:44.065
but my father didn't really...

35:44.155 --> 35:46.033
Didn't see it as a profession
for a gentleman.

35:47.875 --> 35:49.946
I don't believe he'd have gone that far.

35:50.475 --> 35:53.388
But he didn't think it
quite suitable for a peer, no.

35:54.315 --> 35:56.705
I must try and find an example
to rebut that.

35:58.995 --> 36:00.907
Well, I must be going.

36:01.915 --> 36:05.625
- Let me take you. My car's outside.
- I can easily walk.

36:06.115 --> 36:07.708
I'd like to. Please.

36:07.955 --> 36:10.231
Then... Thank you.

36:12.155 --> 36:13.635
I should go too, Granny.

36:13.715 --> 36:16.947
No, stay. I want to speak to you.

36:21.315 --> 36:24.228
So were you still the chauffeur when
you married?

36:25.635 --> 36:27.274
That's a long story.

36:27.635 --> 36:29.866
Everything with you's a long story.

36:30.715 --> 36:34.026
Well, that one had a happy ending.
For a time, anyway.

36:38.315 --> 36:42.514
I know she died. I'm so sorry.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.709
She must have been a very
unusual and independent person.

36:51.515 --> 36:55.429
It's nice that they asked you to stay,
to make your life here.

36:56.795 --> 36:59.629
I have a little daughter,
and it seemed the right thing.

37:00.715 --> 37:03.594
Still, it makes me take
a kinder view of the family.

37:03.675 --> 37:06.554
Oh? What do you have against them?

37:06.875 --> 37:11.870
Nothing. But, as a rule,
I don't really warm to their type.

37:13.115 --> 37:18.235
I don't believe in types.
I believe in people. Now give it a try.

37:22.355 --> 37:24.745
-
-

37:28.595 --> 37:30.393
I really am very grateful.

37:31.395 --> 37:32.385
Thank you.

37:48.675 --> 37:54.148
I don't often say it,
but Rosamund is right.

37:54.275 --> 37:56.870
I do not know this Mr, Mr Drewe,

37:59.075 --> 38:05.185
but even if he's everything you say,
to keep the child here would be

38:05.275 --> 38:08.712
like a permanent sword of Damocles,
inches from your head.

38:09.675 --> 38:15.911
But I can't bear the thought of giving it away.
And is it right that it should grow up Swiss?

38:16.595 --> 38:22.512
Well, Switzerland has everything to offer,
except perhaps conversation,

38:23.395 --> 38:25.785
and one can learn to live without that.

38:25.875 --> 38:27.753
And if Michael turns up?

38:28.475 --> 38:33.948
Well, if you want my advice, start again.
Now, I will pay for everything.

38:34.915 --> 38:37.111
Aunt Rosamund said she would.

38:37.195 --> 38:39.312
You'll be quite enough in her debt as it is.

38:40.155 --> 38:44.627
Take any more and she'll start
exacting annual tribute.

38:45.715 --> 38:49.948
What do your sons do?
I assume they do something.

38:50.155 --> 38:52.670
Remember I met Larry at that dinner?

38:52.995 --> 38:55.829
Ah, don't remind me. They do work.

38:57.195 --> 39:02.145
Larry's in banking and Tim's in the diplomatic
so nothing very startling there.

39:02.235 --> 39:05.228
- What about yours?
- Matthew was a lawyer.

39:05.835 --> 39:07.827
Ah. Has he given it up?

39:08.275 --> 39:09.504
He's...

39:10.795 --> 39:12.388
He's dead.

39:13.435 --> 39:15.233
I thought you would know that.

39:15.795 --> 39:20.745
Oh, good God, I'm terribly sorry.
I'd forgotten for a moment who you were.

39:21.235 --> 39:22.988
Don't worry. Please.

39:24.675 --> 39:28.430
How is Mary? I do wish I could
have seen her today.

39:28.635 --> 39:32.914
Well, slow to start with, but now she's
on her way, which I'm glad of.

39:32.995 --> 39:34.224
I've heard they were well-suited.

39:34.315 --> 39:38.673
Yes, they were happy.
Which makes the parting worse,

39:38.755 --> 39:42.066
but gives you strength
in the end, as we know.

39:45.715 --> 39:48.514
You maybe. Not me.

39:50.075 --> 39:52.510
Lady Merton and I were not exactly
meant to be together.

39:53.315 --> 39:55.466
We struggled on, of course,
as everyone did in those days,

39:56.955 --> 39:58.912
but I'm not sure now
how sensible it was.

40:01.555 --> 40:06.311
I envy you your wonderful memories,
but I can't pretend to match them.

40:23.835 --> 40:25.474
Is Mr Ross here yet?

40:25.555 --> 40:27.069
Who shall I say is calling?

40:27.155 --> 40:28.305
Rose's cousin.

40:48.115 --> 40:49.105
Lady Mary.

40:51.075 --> 40:52.873
I was wondering if it'd be you.

40:52.955 --> 40:54.708
How did you know someone was coming?

40:55.115 --> 40:59.632
Rose telephoned. She said she'd told you
we were about to set the date.

41:01.035 --> 41:02.708
I just made some tea.
Would you like a cup?

41:03.115 --> 41:04.151
Thank you.

41:07.955 --> 41:10.424
I suppose you're here to say
that Lord Flintshire would find

41:10.515 --> 41:13.349
the prospect of
a black son-in-law preposterous.

41:14.235 --> 41:15.589
And your father would agree.

41:16.275 --> 41:17.311
To be fair to Papa,

41:17.395 --> 41:21.184
he'd find your being a band singer even
harder to swallow than your colour.

41:26.155 --> 41:31.674
Mr Ross, are you sure about this?
Marriage is a challenge.

41:31.755 --> 41:36.830
Even when everyone wants it,
even if everyone prays you'll be happy.

41:37.635 --> 41:40.514
You mean in our case,
they'll all be trying to pull us apart.

41:41.155 --> 41:43.112
Every hour of every day.

41:53.875 --> 41:56.185
Tell me, do you think she loves you?

41:57.635 --> 41:59.194
Don't you believe in us?

41:59.475 --> 42:06.075
I believe in you. I'm not so sure about her.
She may love you a bit.

42:06.155 --> 42:09.353
But mostly I'd say she wants to
shock her mother,

42:09.435 --> 42:10.949
whom, incidentally, she hates.

42:13.475 --> 42:18.072
That's what my mother said.
She said Rose must be proving some point.

42:19.755 --> 42:22.429
You and my mother have a lot in common.

42:23.795 --> 42:28.347
Tell me honestly, do you think you can
survive what they'll do to you?

42:28.955 --> 42:30.628
Because I don't believe Rose could.

42:31.355 --> 42:36.191
It may come as something of a relief for you
to hear that I will not be marrying Rose.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.548
You won't?

42:38.675 --> 42:44.467
No. I've enjoyed her dreams.
I think she's more than you allow.

42:45.755 --> 42:46.825
But?

42:48.275 --> 42:49.834
I don't want to spoil her life.

42:51.795 --> 42:54.469
I don't want to watch while people
point at her and jeer.

42:56.635 --> 43:00.595
I love her. I want her to be happy.

43:02.755 --> 43:04.075
So you'll end it?

43:05.075 --> 43:08.671
Yes. I should probably
have stopped it sooner,

43:08.755 --> 43:12.590
but at any rate,
I'm stopping it now.

43:15.275 --> 43:16.948
So will you tell Rose? Or shall I?

43:17.035 --> 43:21.746
I'll tell her. I'll write to her.
She'll get it tomorrow.

43:27.635 --> 43:29.672
It doesn't mean I think it's right.

43:29.755 --> 43:32.429
I wouldn't give in, if we lived in
even a slightly better world.

43:35.795 --> 43:40.790
It may surprise you, Mr Ross,
but if we lived in a better world,

43:40.875 --> 43:42.025
I wouldn't want you to.

44:05.515 --> 44:08.349
I've been downstairs, m'lady.
They're making dinner for you now.

44:08.835 --> 44:09.825
I don't want a lot.

44:09.955 --> 44:10.945
I've told them that.

44:11.955 --> 44:12.945
How are you?

44:15.715 --> 44:17.354
Much as I was yesterday.

44:18.395 --> 44:19.795
Much as I will be tomorrow.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.509
Anna.

44:23.555 --> 44:26.115
I've decided to see Lord Gillingham.

44:26.195 --> 44:28.027
I'm sorry, but I must do something.

44:28.795 --> 44:31.026
I'll telephone and suggest
we meet for luncheon.

44:31.595 --> 44:33.712
Then I'll ask him straight out
to dismiss his valet.

44:33.875 --> 44:35.229
I won't say why.

44:36.875 --> 44:38.229
That makes me so nervous.

44:38.475 --> 44:41.752
Don't be.
No one needs to know the reason.

44:42.435 --> 44:44.791
Green simply won't be
back at Downton again.

44:45.155 --> 44:48.592
Is Bates going to challenge Lord Gillingham
as to why he has a different valet?

44:50.235 --> 44:51.225
I suppose not.

44:51.995 --> 44:54.271
So you have nothing to fear
if he pays us a visit.

44:55.715 --> 44:56.705
And will he, m'lady?

44:59.475 --> 45:01.307
Er, dinner's on the table, m'lady.

45:01.595 --> 45:04.667
I'm not sure Mead
would have put it like that, but thank you.

45:22.075 --> 45:25.546
So, we decorate the stalls today.
You all know the drill.

45:25.635 --> 45:30.232
And remember, anything shabby
shows Downton in a bad light.

45:30.635 --> 45:31.751
And we can't have that.

45:32.235 --> 45:33.794
No, Mrs Hughes. We can't.

45:36.835 --> 45:37.825
Will you come?

45:38.115 --> 45:40.186
It'll give you a chance
to meet a few people from the village.

45:40.795 --> 45:42.149
Is it not just the estate workers?

45:42.555 --> 45:45.673
Oh, no, no. No, the whole area gets behind
the Church bazaar.

45:47.115 --> 45:48.105
You're very lucky, you know.

45:50.875 --> 45:53.265
Nobody's ever called me that.
Least of all myself.

45:54.275 --> 45:56.471
To grow up in a village
where people know and like you,

45:57.155 --> 45:58.475
where your family's respected.

45:59.155 --> 46:00.635
There's plenty who'd
give an eye for that.

46:03.115 --> 46:04.595
I'm not used to feeling lucky.

46:05.195 --> 46:06.834
Well, you should be.

46:13.875 --> 46:15.514
Are we trying for a colour scheme?

46:15.795 --> 46:17.468
Goodness, I thought I'd be
down before anyone.

46:17.835 --> 46:22.193
Oh, no. This is one task
that demands an early start.

46:22.275 --> 46:23.629
We've got the tent up for the tea,

46:23.795 --> 46:25.548
and they're fetching
the tables and chairs from the barn.

46:25.635 --> 46:28.833
Just don't let them mess up the grass
too much when they drive them back.

46:29.515 --> 46:32.587
Right. One, two, three. Lift.

46:32.675 --> 46:34.587
Here. I can manage.

46:37.755 --> 46:39.075
Should you be doing this?

46:39.555 --> 46:41.592
Why? What are you afraid of?

46:42.315 --> 46:43.795
That I'll lose the baby?

46:45.795 --> 46:47.627
So they've made you
a beast of burden now?

46:47.875 --> 46:48.865
That's right.

46:49.155 --> 46:51.386
And they're not taking advantage?

46:51.475 --> 46:52.465
Are they ready for these?

46:52.555 --> 46:55.115
Give me those. James!
Could you take these to the tent, please?

46:59.795 --> 47:02.708
May I present Miss Bunting?
She teaches at the village school.

47:03.275 --> 47:04.755
I'm very interested in the school.

47:06.515 --> 47:07.631
You know Lady Grantham?

47:09.395 --> 47:10.385
Of course.

47:10.475 --> 47:12.626
It's nice to meet you,
but I'm afraid I must get on.

47:18.035 --> 47:20.027
So that's the great Countess of Grantham.

47:20.635 --> 47:22.831
It is.
Another beast of burden.

47:29.995 --> 47:31.111
ANTHONY: So be it.

47:31.955 --> 47:34.629
I'll sack him if you insist.
But you should tell me why. It's only fair.

47:34.715 --> 47:36.991
I don't know if it's fair or unfair,
but I can't.

47:37.635 --> 47:38.625
Not even a hint?

47:38.715 --> 47:40.069
I've said what I can.

47:42.115 --> 47:45.791
He's done something you'd find abhorrent.

47:49.355 --> 47:50.345
Well, you win.

47:51.195 --> 47:54.711
It does seem mean,
even if I don't like him very much.

47:55.075 --> 47:56.953
You wouldn't think it mean
if you knew the truth.

47:58.755 --> 47:59.745
Well, I believe you.

48:00.995 --> 48:02.509
I love you and I believe you.

48:04.835 --> 48:06.235
Have you spoken to Mabel?

48:07.795 --> 48:09.991
I have.
But I wasn't going to bring it up.

48:10.555 --> 48:11.545
Why not?

48:11.675 --> 48:13.075
I don't want to twist your arm.

48:13.915 --> 48:15.952
And I know that you won't
make a decision until it suits you.

48:16.555 --> 48:17.830
How did she take it?

48:17.915 --> 48:21.625
I'm so pleased you asked.
I think the answer is with real style.

48:23.035 --> 48:24.025
Well, I'm glad.

48:25.995 --> 48:27.873
And now, can you get the bill?
I'm terribly late.

48:28.275 --> 48:31.905
I must catch the last train.
It's the Church bazaar tomorrow.

48:34.075 --> 48:35.065
I won't give up, Mary.

48:36.115 --> 48:38.584
Not until you walk down the aisle
with another man,

48:39.235 --> 48:41.306
and very possibly not even then.

48:42.875 --> 48:46.266
I find that both irritating
and beguiling in equal measure.

48:48.355 --> 48:50.392
Should I take comfort from that?

48:50.475 --> 48:51.465
Take what you like.

48:52.475 --> 48:53.465
I'm going.

49:01.995 --> 49:03.509
And do what I ask with Green,

49:04.755 --> 49:06.906
and please let me know when you've done it.

49:19.075 --> 49:20.065
You sent for me?

49:20.795 --> 49:22.673
I wouldn't put it like that.

49:23.195 --> 49:24.948
I just wondered if you might be free.

49:25.235 --> 49:27.466
Oh?
Your wish is my command.

49:27.555 --> 49:31.754
These came this morning from Lord Merton.
As a thank you.

49:31.835 --> 49:32.825
Well, that was kind of him.

49:33.995 --> 49:35.190
But what part do I play in it?

49:36.355 --> 49:37.345
They're for you.

49:40.195 --> 49:41.185
For me? Surely not.

49:41.995 --> 49:43.668
Yes, he sent me some, too.

49:44.235 --> 49:45.874
These came with them.

49:47.275 --> 49:48.265
I've read the card.

49:50.075 --> 49:52.635
He asks forgiveness for his tactlessness.

49:54.155 --> 49:55.384
Was he tactless?

49:55.755 --> 49:56.905
He didn't mean to be tactless.

49:58.795 --> 49:59.785
How nice.

50:00.035 --> 50:01.025
Mmm.

50:02.155 --> 50:03.953
Very nice.

50:04.595 --> 50:08.555
Quite, quite surprising, but very nice.

50:11.995 --> 50:13.987
CARSON: I'm just going up
to see if they need anything more.

50:14.955 --> 50:16.548
Can you leave these for one of the hall boys?

50:16.675 --> 50:18.746
I'll do them, Mr Carson. I don't mind.

50:20.675 --> 50:21.950
You took your time in York.

50:22.595 --> 50:24.632
Yes. It was quite a long day.

50:28.835 --> 50:29.825
What were you up to?

50:30.675 --> 50:32.109
Oh. This and that.

50:36.035 --> 50:38.231
CARSON: One, two, three. Go.

50:51.595 --> 50:53.666
- Lovely to see you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

51:08.395 --> 51:10.387
You got his letter, then?

51:10.475 --> 51:11.829
You're so disappointing, Mary.

51:13.475 --> 51:16.434
I thought you understood,
and all the time you were just like my mother.

51:17.235 --> 51:18.225
No, I'm not.

51:19.235 --> 51:20.430
But I understand this.

51:21.075 --> 51:23.795
If you're going to complicate your life,
do it for the right reasons.

51:24.955 --> 51:25.945
James.

51:26.675 --> 51:32.034
I am putting the tea tent in your charge.
Make sure they don't run out of anything.

51:32.275 --> 51:34.835
But her ladyship said
we were to enjoy ourselves.

51:35.195 --> 51:36.265
Let us consider this.

51:36.355 --> 51:39.268
She wants you to enjoy yourself,
I want you to run the tent.

51:39.675 --> 51:42.235
Now, which of us can
make your life more uncomfortable?

51:46.675 --> 51:47.665
Mr Molesley.

51:48.595 --> 51:49.585
Mr Molesley!

51:49.915 --> 51:50.905
Mr Molesley!

51:50.995 --> 51:52.873
You tell those people
where they're supposed to park.

51:53.875 --> 51:54.865
Wait a minute.

51:55.235 --> 51:56.635
It's his lordship.
His lordship's back!

51:57.475 --> 51:59.865
Tell the others!
His lordship's back! James!

52:07.675 --> 52:10.713
How can you be here?
Why didn't you send a message?

52:11.195 --> 52:13.471
We would have made such a fuss!
You're a beast!

52:13.555 --> 52:15.194
ROBERT: Oh, not quite a beast, I hope.

52:15.395 --> 52:17.512
I wanted to surprise you,
and I think I have.

52:17.595 --> 52:20.235
Oh, Papa, you should have let us know!
When did you get in?

52:20.315 --> 52:22.432
This morning.
I'd forgotten about the bazaar,

52:22.515 --> 52:25.189
but it just shows I was right not
to distract you all from your labours.

52:25.835 --> 52:27.064
What happened to Uncle Harold?

52:29.995 --> 52:30.985
So it was worth your going.

52:31.075 --> 52:33.226
Well, I don't think I made
a blind bit of difference,

52:33.315 --> 52:34.954
but let's hold on to that fiction.

52:35.275 --> 52:36.265
How was it?

52:36.795 --> 52:37.911
Interesting.

52:38.635 --> 52:39.864
Very modern.

52:40.755 --> 52:42.030
Very interesting.

52:43.395 --> 52:44.385
How's it been here?

52:44.555 --> 52:46.990
- Not very interesting and not very modern.
-

52:47.075 --> 52:48.065
Carson.

52:48.275 --> 52:50.028
Hello, Bates. Have you missed me?

52:51.115 --> 52:52.469
Because I've certainly missed you.

52:52.755 --> 52:53.984
Good to see you back, m'lord.

52:58.435 --> 53:01.985
You're back. I can't believe it.

53:02.715 --> 53:05.549
If you knew how many times
I'd imagined this scene.

53:13.195 --> 53:15.790
MASON: This is a treat. It's been a while.

53:17.435 --> 53:18.869
DAISY: I'm sorry if I've stayed away.

53:19.235 --> 53:22.273
MASON: Nay, no apologies.
Not from you. Not here.

53:22.915 --> 53:26.625
You're my daughter-in-law,
you're all that I've got left of my son.

53:27.915 --> 53:30.635
Whether you come here or not,
this is your home.

53:31.315 --> 53:32.715
I do love it when I come.

53:36.075 --> 53:37.065
That's it.

53:38.395 --> 53:41.627
Oh, there you are, Alfred. Nice to see you.
Have a glass of this.

53:42.395 --> 53:43.351
Is Ivy about?

53:43.435 --> 53:45.154
Erm, I'm just here.

53:49.435 --> 53:50.425
Thank you.

53:54.715 --> 53:55.990
How was the funeral?

53:56.875 --> 53:57.865
It was well-attended.

53:58.475 --> 54:00.194
So that's something
for my mother to hold on to.

54:01.635 --> 54:02.625
I read your letter.

54:05.355 --> 54:06.675
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

54:06.755 --> 54:07.745
No, I'm sorry.

54:08.275 --> 54:12.474
I got the wrong end of the stick when I
were last up here, but it were my mistake.

54:12.555 --> 54:15.787
All you did was try and
give me a nice welcome,

54:16.235 --> 54:17.510
and you can't feel sorry for that.

54:18.035 --> 54:19.151
We can part as friends?

54:20.395 --> 54:21.875
We can, as far as I'm concerned.

54:26.755 --> 54:27.745
Is Daisy here?

54:30.075 --> 54:33.546
I wanted to see if she and I could
be friends an' all, before I go.

54:34.275 --> 54:36.187
She's gone to Mr Mason's farm for the day.

54:36.795 --> 54:37.785
She won't be back till late.

54:38.635 --> 54:39.625
Oh.

54:44.195 --> 54:47.506
Daisy, are you here to avoid seeing Alfred?

54:48.715 --> 54:50.229
Ivy's turned him down again,

54:50.955 --> 54:52.435
so he won't come back after today.

54:52.915 --> 54:54.827
What does Mrs Patmore say about it?

54:55.075 --> 54:57.032
To stay away so I don't meet him.

54:59.035 --> 55:00.515
I would advise against that.

55:00.955 --> 55:03.311
But why? I thought you'd be glad
if I stayed a little bit longer.

55:03.475 --> 55:06.070
Oh, I wish you'd stay and never leave
and I hope you will one day.

55:06.835 --> 55:08.064
But Mrs Patmore's wrong.

55:10.955 --> 55:16.792
Daisy, there won't be too many people
that you love in your life and he is one.

55:17.155 --> 55:20.068
I don't know what I feel about him. Not now.

55:20.315 --> 55:23.433
Even so, you need to say goodbye
to this young man,

55:24.235 --> 55:27.911
with nothing jagged,
nothing harsh, between you.

55:29.035 --> 55:30.947
I couldn't think of the words.

55:31.915 --> 55:32.905
We'll find them together.

55:34.435 --> 55:38.429
And, er, we'll get you
back to Downton in time.

55:40.475 --> 55:41.465
Are you bearing up?

55:44.155 --> 55:46.351
I'm never going to see Michael again, am I?

55:47.155 --> 55:51.115
If you want to go out there
and look for him, I'll support you.

55:51.795 --> 55:56.187
They've already done all that.
Police and private detectives and everything.

55:56.475 --> 55:57.704
Well, then you must be patient.

55:58.835 --> 56:01.430
Sometimes I feel that God
doesn't want me to be happy.

56:01.915 --> 56:06.785
My dear, all life is a series of problems
which we must try and solve.

56:07.075 --> 56:10.034
You know, first one,
then the next and the next,

56:11.635 --> 56:13.035
until at last we die.

56:20.355 --> 56:23.393
Yes. That should sort it out.

56:23.475 --> 56:24.465
Mmm.

56:36.715 --> 56:38.388
Isn't that Lord Gillingham?

56:38.475 --> 56:40.387
What? It can't be. Where?

56:43.595 --> 56:46.030
What does Miss Lane Fox
think about it? That's what I wonder.

56:46.115 --> 56:49.870
I agree. He's the most unconvincing fianc?
I've ever come across.

56:50.875 --> 56:52.025
ROSAMUND: Perhaps she doesn't know.

56:52.675 --> 56:55.031
If we know, she knows.
You can count on that.

56:56.995 --> 56:58.429
MARY: Green?

56:58.515 --> 57:00.313
But how can he be dead?

57:00.915 --> 57:02.668
I'm only telling you what they told me,

57:03.275 --> 57:04.994
that he was in Piccadilly and he...

57:06.115 --> 57:09.233
slipped or stumbled and fell into the road.

57:09.995 --> 57:11.429
I don't know what to say.

57:12.795 --> 57:15.435
It just seemed so odd
after our conversation yesterday

57:15.515 --> 57:18.747
that I felt I should bring you the news myself.

57:22.235 --> 57:24.466
Can you explain to me now
why you wanted him sacked?

57:25.715 --> 57:26.705
No.

57:27.875 --> 57:28.865
ROBERT: Hello, Tony.

57:29.115 --> 57:32.267
Heavens, what a gathering of the clans
today is turning out to be.

57:32.355 --> 57:33.709
Would you excuse me for a moment?

57:35.595 --> 57:38.633
I don't suppose it's a good sign
to find you back at Downton?

57:39.955 --> 57:41.753
Not really. Not this time.

57:45.675 --> 57:49.066
You mean he fell into the road
and he was hit?

57:50.155 --> 57:51.145
Yesterday?

57:51.235 --> 57:53.352
By a bus or a lorry, apparently.

57:54.835 --> 57:55.951
And someone saw this?

57:56.875 --> 58:00.232
The pavement was crowded.
Lots of people saw it.

58:03.435 --> 58:04.425
That's a relief.

58:05.395 --> 58:06.385
What do you mean?

58:08.835 --> 58:12.033
Nothing. I don't mean anything.

58:12.995 --> 58:13.985
Mary!

58:15.435 --> 58:16.994
Did your mother warn you I was coming?

58:17.595 --> 58:18.585
She did.

58:19.835 --> 58:21.747
Why are you back in Yorkshire so soon?

58:22.075 --> 58:25.466
I'd no sooner got back than I was despatched
to a tenant farmers' convention in Whitby.

58:25.915 --> 58:27.827
But it's over now, so, I'll go home from here.

58:29.315 --> 58:30.305
Can I ask you something?

58:30.955 --> 58:31.945
Of course.

58:32.115 --> 58:33.549
It's an odd question.

58:34.435 --> 58:35.425
Go on.

58:36.235 --> 58:39.911
If you thought a man was involved in a crime,
or an incident,

58:40.835 --> 58:45.227
but you didn't blame him,
in fact you thought right was on his side,

58:45.635 --> 58:46.625
what would you do?

58:47.395 --> 58:51.435
It's a bit theoretical for an opinion.
But you don't believe he was wrong?

58:52.355 --> 58:53.345
No.

58:53.435 --> 58:55.472
Well, I'm guessing in the dark, but...

58:56.675 --> 58:57.904
I suspect I would say nothing.

59:02.995 --> 59:04.714
That isn't fair. It's weighted.

59:05.875 --> 59:07.707
Go on. You have a go, Mr Molesley.

59:10.475 --> 59:12.273
I won't manage it if Jimmy can't.

59:12.955 --> 59:15.311
Try. I want to see it.

59:27.395 --> 59:28.749
Well done!

59:29.475 --> 59:30.465
That was cheating.

59:32.155 --> 59:34.192
Well, it...
It's in the arms.

59:35.355 --> 59:38.507
It's all to do with the swing,
and the swing is in the arms.

59:39.235 --> 59:40.351
So, Miss Baxter.

59:41.035 --> 59:43.789
Anything to tell me about life
since I've been away?

59:45.075 --> 59:47.749
No. Nothing's happened.

59:51.155 --> 59:52.669
I'll find out if it has, you know.

59:52.875 --> 59:54.309
Leave her alone, Mr Barrow.

59:55.395 --> 59:58.832
We don't want any bullying brought back
from overseas. Do we, Miss Baxter?

01:00:00.155 --> 01:00:03.307
Now, are there any stalls
you'd still like to see?

01:00:15.595 --> 01:00:19.987
God, what a relief to be able to
drink in public without a policeman pouncing.

01:00:20.275 --> 01:00:21.265
Down with Prohibition.

01:00:21.875 --> 01:00:24.754
You can't mean you never had a drink
all the time you were there.

01:00:25.515 --> 01:00:27.074
Harold has his uses.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:32.430
And let us hope they both
leave us in peace.

01:00:32.915 --> 01:00:34.668
A slim hope, I'm afraid.

01:00:34.835 --> 01:00:38.067
Martha wants to bring him over next summer
for Rose's coming-out ball.

01:00:38.155 --> 01:00:39.145
Why?

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:42.273
She says she wants to see another
London Season before she dies.

01:00:48.355 --> 01:00:49.345
Ooh.

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:55.346
You're still here. Thank goodness.

01:00:56.395 --> 01:00:59.832
I caught an early bus, but it was delayed.
I thought I'd missed you.

01:01:00.315 --> 01:01:03.308
I'm off to the station now, Daisy.
And I won't be back.

01:01:04.315 --> 01:01:07.274
My dad's gone and mother's moving to Crewe
to be nearer my sister,

01:01:08.195 --> 01:01:10.312
so I'm glad you're here to say goodbye.
I really am.

01:01:10.715 --> 01:01:12.069
I've brought you a present.

01:01:12.715 --> 01:01:14.991
Mr Mason's made you a basket full of things.

01:01:15.475 --> 01:01:18.547
Rolls and cheese and ham,
and jams and pickles

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:21.231
and he's put some cider in too,
to keep you going on the train home.

01:01:21.355 --> 01:01:25.065
That was kind of him, Daisy.
Are you sure it wasn't meant for you?

01:01:25.435 --> 01:01:26.789
No. He did it for Alfred.

01:01:27.195 --> 01:01:29.790
I told him we were old friends,
so he did it for you.

01:01:37.955 --> 01:01:38.945
You know Ivy turned me down?

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:40.185
I do, yes.

01:01:40.275 --> 01:01:42.232
I think I've been a bit blind
where she's concerned.

01:01:42.955 --> 01:01:43.945
Love is blind.

01:01:44.115 --> 01:01:46.675
Maybe. But I wonder now
if I've not been a fool.

01:01:47.235 --> 01:01:49.591
You've always been so good to me, Daisy,
so true.

01:01:50.475 --> 01:01:51.465
But I could never see it.

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:55.668
That's kind of you to say,
and good to hear.

01:01:57.315 --> 01:02:00.149
I loved you, Alfred.
I'll not deny it.

01:02:00.955 --> 01:02:04.187
But that's done with now,
and what I felt won't come back.

01:02:04.515 --> 01:02:06.711
It's time for you to go your way
and me to go mine.

01:02:08.315 --> 01:02:09.305
But you wish me well?

01:02:09.395 --> 01:02:15.073
Oh, I do, Alfred, yeah. So well.
So very well. Friends forever.

01:02:16.635 --> 01:02:17.671
Friends forever, Daisy.

01:02:22.195 --> 01:02:24.266
Right. Now this really is goodbye.

01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:37.354
Are you all right, Daisy?

01:02:37.435 --> 01:02:40.394
I'll just get this off
and pop in the pantry for my apron.

01:02:56.515 --> 01:02:57.744
Well, that's that, then.

01:03:02.715 --> 01:03:05.833
Do you know, when you
brought up that basket,

01:03:07.195 --> 01:03:11.553
I were so proud of you,
I felt like crying out.

01:03:12.395 --> 01:03:16.833
If you were my own daughter,
I couldn't be prouder than I am now.

01:03:36.235 --> 01:03:37.589
BLAKE: You do know why I came today.

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.235
To see the bazaar?

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:40.305
To see you.

01:03:42.195 --> 01:03:47.589
I find, perhaps to my surprise, that
since I left, I can't think of anything but you.

01:03:48.475 --> 01:03:50.273
To your surprise and my surprise.

01:03:52.075 --> 01:03:53.714
I'm only asking for a chance.

01:03:55.275 --> 01:03:57.187
Was there really a conference in Whitby?

01:03:58.795 --> 01:03:59.785
Of course not.

01:04:01.795 --> 01:04:04.833
I'm flattered, Charles,
and even moved.

01:04:06.115 --> 01:04:09.347
But rather than add to the list
of men I've disappointed,

01:04:10.475 --> 01:04:13.866
it might be kinder to refuse you now
and let you off the hook.

01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:16.145
Hmm.

01:04:17.235 --> 01:04:18.954
I'm afraid I couldn't allow that.

01:04:22.555 --> 01:04:23.875
Not without putting up a fight.

01:04:37.675 --> 01:04:38.665
What are you still doing here?

01:04:38.915 --> 01:04:42.386
I wish I knew what you were up to yesterday.
Why did you go?

01:04:42.995 --> 01:04:43.985
I wanted to get away.

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:47.195
You'd never do anything foolish, would you?

01:04:49.675 --> 01:04:51.314
You'd never risk everything
we've built together?

01:04:51.635 --> 01:04:52.625
Certainly not.

01:04:53.515 --> 01:04:56.906
You know me. When I do a thing,
I like to have a very good reason for doing it.

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:14.787
Where have you two been hiding?

01:05:14.875 --> 01:05:17.026
In plain view, where all good tricksters hide.

01:05:17.235 --> 01:05:20.706
Look what I've found. Tom, will you see
if there are some clean glasses on that table?

01:05:22.435 --> 01:05:24.950
Well done, my dear. A real triumph.

01:05:26.795 --> 01:05:27.785
I hope so.

01:05:28.115 --> 01:05:30.789
I've told them they can come back
and clear up the rest tomorrow.

01:05:31.235 --> 01:05:33.431
I thought that was the best bazaar
I've known here.

01:05:33.515 --> 01:05:37.191
Oh, certainly. At least since
your father and I were running it.

01:05:38.675 --> 01:05:41.474
And now, as the prodigal husband,
home from the sea,

01:05:41.595 --> 01:05:44.747
let me raise a glass
to my extraordinary wife

01:05:44.835 --> 01:05:47.395
who can clearly manage
far better in my absence.

01:05:47.635 --> 01:05:48.625
Cora!

01:05:49.115 --> 01:05:50.834
ALL: Cora!
MARY: Mama.

01:05:51.675 --> 01:05:54.747
Very well done, Lady Grantham.
And now, I'm afraid I should be going.

01:05:55.075 --> 01:05:56.475
It was so kind of you to come.

01:05:56.595 --> 01:05:58.712
ANTHONY: I don't suppose I could
ask you for a lift this time?

01:05:58.915 --> 01:06:00.907
I came by train, but I'd much rather drive.

01:06:01.595 --> 01:06:02.585
Certainly.

01:06:03.515 --> 01:06:04.744
I'll see you off.

01:06:09.195 --> 01:06:13.016
What sort of manage has that turned into
while I've been away?
