00:23.283 --> 00:26.120
I did not mean to drop
a bat on your head

00:27.079 --> 00:29.305
Anyways I didn't think it
would hurt so much

00:29.456 --> 00:32.584

01:37.356 --> 01:39.317

02:41.837 --> 02:43.738
You didn't hit anything to me.

02:43.839 --> 02:45.424
Here's one Joey.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.635

02:55.767 --> 02:57.394
Oh, why should I worry about him?

02:57.561 --> 02:59.229
You didn't give me a turn.

03:01.314 --> 03:02.732
Boy I'm hot.

03:02.899 --> 03:05.944
I hope its even hotter tomorrow
when we go to Coney Island.

03:06.110 --> 03:08.654
Hey fellas, I almost forgot.

03:10.781 --> 03:12.116
Look at this!

03:13.409 --> 03:14.660
They're real!

03:14.827 --> 03:16.979
Sure, my mom gave it
to me for my birthday.

03:17.037 --> 03:18.289
To spend on Coney.

03:18.456 --> 03:20.082
Wow, we can all go on a parachute!

03:20.207 --> 03:21.584
Where do you get that all stuff?

03:21.750 --> 03:24.378
Means I can go on the
parachute, plenty of times.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.088
Give me the ball.

03:26.213 --> 03:28.966
I'm going to practise throwing
so I can win a prize tomorrow.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.469
You know where you
knock the bottles down.

03:31.635 --> 03:34.263
Oh yeah. I think I
know the place.

03:36.307 --> 03:37.767
Come on fellas.

03:41.187 --> 03:42.187
Good shot!

03:42.271 --> 03:43.564
Nice throwin'.

03:43.731 --> 03:44.982
Let me try.

03:45.149 --> 03:47.526
What for? You don't need no practise.

03:47.693 --> 03:49.779
You ain't going to Coney with us.

03:49.945 --> 03:53.282
Just 'coz Joey ain't even old enough to
come with us you don't have to rub it in.

03:53.449 --> 03:56.368
Huh! I suppose you won't be glad
have him as a pet for a whole day.

03:56.994 --> 03:59.288
Sure I will but you
don't have to rub it in.

03:59.455 --> 04:01.791
Please Lennie, let me try.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.211
Okay, knock 'em down

04:10.215 --> 04:11.299
See, Stay!

04:11.466 --> 04:13.468
Do you think the Dodgers
would hire him Harry?

04:13.635 --> 04:15.095
He'd play for the giants.

04:15.261 --> 04:16.762
Come on fellas, I got to go.

04:16.930 --> 04:19.099
Yeah, we better go too.
Come on Joey.

04:28.691 --> 04:30.276
Ma! Ma!

04:32.654 --> 04:34.489
Ma, Lennie's teasing me!

04:34.656 --> 04:36.741
Quiet, l'm on long distance.

04:37.826 --> 04:39.619
Have you had the doctor?

04:40.078 --> 04:41.663
Are you sure that's what it is?

04:42.038 --> 04:44.040
Or what he thinks.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.584
Of course, of course.

04:47.794 --> 04:49.712
You got to have someone...

04:50.380 --> 04:52.090
Did you call Helen?

04:52.924 --> 04:53.924
Oh...

04:56.386 --> 04:57.554
All right.

04:57.929 --> 04:58.929
Ma!

04:59.097 --> 05:01.641
Shut up, mom
is on long distance.

05:01.933 --> 05:02.976
What's the matter mom?

05:03.351 --> 05:05.687
Grandmother is very sick boys.
I've got to go to her.

05:07.272 --> 05:08.898
Is grandma going to die ma?

05:09.065 --> 05:10.775
Shut up you dope.

05:11.025 --> 05:12.485
Don't worry ma, she'll be okay.

05:13.194 --> 05:16.656
I will only be gone as able.
I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

05:16.780 --> 05:19.825
Tomorrow afternoon?
You mean you're going today?

05:19.950 --> 05:21.160
Yes dear.

05:21.326 --> 05:23.704
I'm making a 2 o'clock train.

05:23.871 --> 05:26.165
But mom.. Come on!

05:26.832 --> 05:29.543
Who's going to take care of Joey tomorrow?
You'll have to.

05:29.918 --> 05:30.919
But mom...

05:32.337 --> 05:35.841
Aw, tomorrow's when I'm supposed to go
with the fellas to Coney Island.

05:36.008 --> 05:37.843
My birthday present.

05:38.218 --> 05:40.604
I don't want to take Joey with me.
No Dear.

05:40.763 --> 05:43.348
Joey can't go to Coney Island.
Neither can you.

05:43.724 --> 05:46.042
I'm sorry Lennie, but this is an emergency.

05:46.143 --> 05:48.103
Why can't I go mom?

05:48.228 --> 05:49.897
Why can't Joey stay home alone?

05:50.063 --> 05:51.774
I don't want to stay home alone.

05:52.566 --> 05:55.194
If your father were alive,
things would different

05:55.360 --> 05:56.810
But you're the man
of the family now.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.614
I don't want to be the man
of the family.

05:59.031 --> 06:01.241
I want to go to Coney Island
with the fellas.

06:01.408 --> 06:03.869
You don't want. You want.

06:04.161 --> 06:07.331
You think I'm going to work every day
in a department store,

06:07.498 --> 06:11.543
and stand on my feet behind a counter
at Polancer and Keethouse.

06:11.752 --> 06:13.253
But I got to do it
or we don't eat.

06:13.587 --> 06:16.173
And you got to stay home
with Joey tomorrow.

06:16.548 --> 06:17.716
Don't look like that.

06:18.550 --> 06:20.761
It's not such a big sacrifice.

06:21.344 --> 06:24.013
You go to Coney Island some other time.

06:24.388 --> 06:26.557
Come on have your lunch Lennie.

06:31.521 --> 06:32.521
Oh Lennie!

06:32.605 --> 06:35.358
See that Joey gets to bed on time tonight.

06:35.566 --> 06:37.652
And you stay in with him.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.826
Lennie. I am leaving you a
shopping list with six dollars

06:45.118 --> 06:46.994
A five and a one.

06:47.328 --> 06:49.747
Make sure you get the right
change for the five now.

06:49.914 --> 06:51.791
Don't forget. Promise.

06:52.333 --> 06:56.379
And remember Mrs. Carlson is always
home, in case anything happens.

07:08.558 --> 07:10.852
Roses are red, violets are blue,

07:11.018 --> 07:14.689
I can't go to Coney Island
and you can't too.

07:28.577 --> 07:29.577
Lennie!

07:29.828 --> 07:32.164
If it's nice tomorrow,
I think Joey to get some air.

07:32.330 --> 07:35.041
I don't want you both cooped
up in the house all day long.

07:35.125 --> 07:38.795
I know you think you take care of
your brother. Your a good boy Lennie.

07:38.962 --> 07:41.923
I'm glad I have two wonderful boys.

07:45.927 --> 07:47.095
Lennie!

07:47.345 --> 07:48.472
Oh, Joey!

07:48.889 --> 07:51.641
Oh gosh, what I put out and you
haven't touched a thing

07:51.808 --> 07:53.393
I'm not hungry.

07:53.894 --> 07:57.105
I don't know how you live.
Come on. Drink your milk.

07:57.397 --> 08:01.234
I'm leaving money and the shopping list
right here under the telephone.

08:01.485 --> 08:02.778
'bye, Lennie.

08:02.944 --> 08:04.029
Goodbye.

08:05.322 --> 08:06.615
Bye, Joey.

08:07.282 --> 08:08.617
Bye, mom.

08:09.826 --> 08:11.453
Bye boys.

08:22.422 --> 08:23.965
Get out of here!

09:16.934 --> 09:18.769
Happy birthday.

09:20.771 --> 09:22.273
Drop dead!

09:33.909 --> 09:36.036
Play with me Lennie.
No!

09:36.203 --> 09:38.497
Mom says you should take care of me

09:38.664 --> 09:40.249
I want to play.

09:40.373 --> 09:42.208
Stop pestering me.

09:44.252 --> 09:45.628
Do you want to play?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.800
Okay. Let's play hide and seek.

09:49.215 --> 09:50.341
Alright.

09:51.259 --> 09:52.469
Start counting.

09:52.969 --> 09:53.969
10...

09:55.652 --> 09:56.652
Hot!

09:58.266 --> 10:01.366
I can't go tomorrow fellas.
What do you mean you can't go?

10:01.394 --> 10:03.188
I just can't go, that's all.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.607
I got stay home and mind Joey.
Aw Jeez.

10:06.441 --> 10:08.067
My mother went away.

10:09.444 --> 10:12.155
I got to mind Joey Aw Jeez.

10:28.546 --> 10:29.672
Hey Lennie,

10:30.423 --> 10:31.758
Look at this.

10:33.051 --> 10:37.097
I bet you if this here
was Joey this was you.

10:37.263 --> 10:39.307
Joey ain't got that much blood.

10:40.975 --> 10:42.930
I know how you can get rid of Joey.

10:42.936 --> 10:44.145
How?

10:44.312 --> 10:47.899
You bury him under the sidewalk
and cement it up again.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.691
They'd never find the body.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.944
Ah, you'd have to kill him first.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.530
Why?

10:55.405 --> 10:56.907
It was only an idea.

10:58.117 --> 11:00.160
Wait a minute, I got it.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.497
We stab him with an icicle.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.081
So what?

11:05.082 --> 11:07.709
They never find the
murder weapon. It melts.

11:08.085 --> 11:11.088
Where'd we get an icicle
in the summertime?

11:13.674 --> 11:16.260
I read a good one.
The Indians used to do it.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.429
We take Joey on a desert

11:18.554 --> 11:22.015
Then we take a keg of ice with a rattle
snake in it and put it on his chest.

11:22.558 --> 11:25.853
Then the sun melts the ice.
I'm worried.

11:26.728 --> 11:30.691
Last night on the television they
blood come out of a guy's ear.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.777
Blood, you dope. That's ketchup!

11:34.862 --> 11:38.407
Ketchup?
So that's how they do it...

11:44.204 --> 11:47.684
You'd better change your shirt Lennie,
It's going to get full of ketchup.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.028
Where was you?

11:53.087 --> 11:55.173
Why didn't you find me?

11:55.923 --> 11:58.176
I looked everywhere,
but you wasn't there.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.052
I got tired tired of hiding.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.138
Hey Joey, Harry has a real gun.

12:02.305 --> 12:05.516
A real one?
Yeah, he's over on the big rock. Come on.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.194
Hi Lennie.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.612
Watch this.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.285
Boing! Bull's-eye

12:28.664 --> 12:30.083
There comes a lion.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.546
Bam! Right between the eyes.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.423
Let me have it.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.344
Ain't she a beauty?

12:44.347 --> 12:47.183
She's a beauty alright Harry.
Where'd you get it?

12:47.350 --> 12:49.977
What do you think?
Where my old man hides it.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.145
Hey...

12:51.521 --> 12:52.939
Don't let Joey touch it.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.441
He's too young to handle Guns.
I am not.

12:55.566 --> 12:56.984
Aw, Let him have a turn.

12:58.318 --> 13:00.237
Well.. Okay.

13:00.987 --> 13:02.823
But I'll have to keep my hands on it.

13:03.740 --> 13:04.908
Let's see it.

13:05.909 --> 13:08.703
Now here is how
you hold a real gun.

13:08.870 --> 13:10.372
Where do you put the bullets?

13:10.539 --> 13:11.915
Right here.

13:12.290 --> 13:15.919
Say Joey, would you like
to shoot a real bullet?

13:16.086 --> 13:18.338
But I don't got a real bullet.

13:19.339 --> 13:20.339
Look.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.009
First you put it in here.

13:24.511 --> 13:25.929
Now you cock it.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.305
There.

13:27.472 --> 13:29.433
That's good, Joey.

13:30.350 --> 13:31.476
Now remember Joey,

13:31.726 --> 13:34.688
This is a real gun
with a real bullet.

13:34.855 --> 13:38.733
You could hurt someone,
even kill someone!

13:39.151 --> 13:40.402
Now take Aim.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.655
Perfect, now you pull the trigger.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.450
Go ahead, Softy, Squeeze it!

13:51.496 --> 13:52.831
Lennie! Lennie!

13:55.000 --> 13:56.835
Lennie's shot, Lennie's shot!

13:57.544 --> 14:00.944
Lennie? Lennie? Do you think
he's dead? Do you think he's dead?

14:01.214 --> 14:02.424
Yeah, I think he's dead.

14:02.591 --> 14:03.591
Dead, yeah.

14:04.008 --> 14:07.052
You've shot him Joey
you shot your brother.

14:07.219 --> 14:08.512

14:12.850 --> 14:16.312

14:25.154 --> 14:27.435
If you tell his mother
she has two kids dead.

14:27.531 --> 14:29.812
Boy, what if she finds out
what happened to Lennie.

14:29.867 --> 14:30.951
You got to beat it Joey!

14:31.118 --> 14:33.120
We'll give you an hours
head start on the cops.

14:33.287 --> 14:34.997
Better hide, Joey.

14:35.791 --> 14:36.943
Take on the lam kid.

14:37.136 --> 14:39.536

14:45.007 --> 14:48.343

14:48.478 --> 14:51.856
Something to remember Lennie by,
You don't need it no more.

16:51.465 --> 16:53.759
I feel kind of sorry for Joey anyway.

16:54.176 --> 16:55.886
Hey, my harmonica!

16:56.053 --> 16:57.762

17:15.531 --> 17:16.656
Listen to him.

17:16.824 --> 17:20.536

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:48.746

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.751
Coney Island?

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.464
And the boardwalk.

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:01.884
Yeah, Yeah I know the place.

01:02:02.343 --> 01:02:04.554
Okay, but keep him there.

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:07.348
Coney Island.

01:02:33.248 --> 01:02:34.541
Gonna be a good crowd today.

01:02:34.708 --> 01:02:37.502
Yup, looks like a good Sunday Pete.
That's right.

01:02:57.272 --> 01:03:00.108
I'm Lennie Norton,
Where's my brother?

01:03:03.478 --> 01:03:04.478
Not here

01:03:04.738 --> 01:03:05.906
Not here?

01:03:06.323 --> 01:03:07.949
No, not anymore.

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:10.619
Better tell me what this is all about.

01:03:11.328 --> 01:03:13.038
It was.. It was only a joke.

01:03:14.664 --> 01:03:16.208
And then you called me on the phone.

01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:19.169
Look Lennie, I think you
better go to the cops.

01:03:19.336 --> 01:03:21.522
But my mother will find out and she...
And maybe she will..

01:03:21.546 --> 01:03:25.217
But you can't a little kid like Joey
wander around Coney Island alone.

01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:27.177
After all he's only seven!

01:03:28.053 --> 01:03:30.555
Now I'm going tol tell you
how to find a police officer.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.765
And tell the sergeant to check all the
merry-go-rounds and pony rides.

01:03:37.812 --> 01:03:39.663
'cause your kid brother is
nuts about horses.

01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:42.132
Yeah, I'll tell him. Thanks.

01:04:00.376 --> 01:04:03.688
Hey mister, have you seen a red
headed kid with a cowboy gun?

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.551
Hmm.. Nope. Not today.

01:04:14.748 --> 01:04:15.748
