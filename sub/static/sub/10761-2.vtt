But a certain man named
Dr. Frasier Crane taught that pupil

whatever he sets his mind to.

And when I finally get to the point
where I never want to see him again,

But you're...
You're much stronger now,

just showing up to change your mind.

Well, to be fair,
he did try to apologise.

25:08.756 --> 25:12.468

He can't take the whole last year back.

can you ever get it back?

And, speaking on behalf
of your subconscious,

Specifically,
her need for another man.

What's wrong with following your

isn't out there somewhere.

36:10.250 --> 36:13.128

every woman is the perfect woman,

36:26.057 --> 36:27.100
Thank you.

36:29.519 --> 36:32.146
It's that quest for perfection
which ultimately defeats you

does not exist.

- Mother.

you sure brought a lot of baggage.

What are you doing here?

You have to ask? You're a Freudian.

36:49.497 --> 36:52.458
You've spent your whole life
trying to replace me.

36:52.625 --> 36:54.168
But it's completely understandable.

We were doing perfectly well
