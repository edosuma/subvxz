NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:38.416 --> 00:41.000
I’ll ask one last time.
Where is he hiding?

00:48.583 --> 00:50.250
Your husband’s a wanted man.

00:50.875 --> 00:52.875
We have orders to bring him in.

00:57.875 --> 00:58.833
One last time.

01:00.083 --> 01:01.083
Where is he?

01:06.208 --> 01:07.958
Colonel, leave her with me.

01:09.875 --> 01:10.833
She’s terrified.

01:11.416 --> 01:13.250
She’ll talk, but not like this.

01:16.208 --> 01:17.166
Five minutes.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.666
Listen, madam.

01:26.791 --> 01:29.750
We’re not here to kill your husband,

01:30.416 --> 01:32.333
but to arrest him.

01:33.958 --> 01:35.291
I’m afraid for my son.

01:36.875 --> 01:39.708
I promise we won’t hurt him.

01:41.125 --> 01:44.500
When your husband is in custody,
we’ll release him to you.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.958
Your son isn’t to blame
for his father’s actions.

01:50.708 --> 01:52.875
Think of your son. Just your son.

01:53.666 --> 01:55.208
He’s all that matters now.

02:18.958 --> 02:21.458
Our guy is in this building. Second floor.

02:27.791 --> 02:28.625
Let’s go.

03:07.750 --> 03:08.833
Stay alert.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.791
The team’s heading up the stairs.

03:13.541 --> 03:14.750
Alpha Team ready.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.583
Copy that, Alpha Team.

03:49.416 --> 03:50.250
The target!

03:50.333 --> 03:52.333
Get down!

03:52.416 --> 03:53.291
Do it.

03:53.375 --> 03:56.666
I said get down!
Hands where I can see them!

03:56.750 --> 03:57.833
Do it.

03:57.916 --> 03:59.833
Don’t look at me! On the ground!

04:00.458 --> 04:02.541
The kid against the wall. Move him.

04:02.625 --> 04:04.583
Get the kid somewhere safe. Away.

04:04.666 --> 04:08.791
Dad, what should I do? I’m really scared.

04:12.625 --> 04:13.833
Something’s wrong.

04:37.916 --> 04:39.291
Answer me when I speak.

04:40.958 --> 04:41.958
Any weapons here?

04:44.666 --> 04:46.000
I asked, any weapons here?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.541
Ask him about weapons.

04:55.416 --> 04:56.750
Do you have weapons?

05:04.125 --> 05:05.166
Take cover!

05:05.250 --> 05:06.083
Get down!

05:06.166 --> 05:07.166
They saw us.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.333
At eleven o’clock.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.166
The ones at two o’clock! In front!

05:18.041 --> 05:19.666
Take the ones on the right!

05:38.083 --> 05:40.291
Target eliminated. The area is clear.

05:57.708 --> 06:00.083
Do it, son. You’ll make me proud.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.291
God will reward you.

06:02.375 --> 06:03.250
Do it!

06:03.333 --> 06:04.291
Shut your mouth!

06:04.375 --> 06:05.541
Do it, son!

06:05.625 --> 06:06.708
Move!

06:10.500 --> 06:11.541
Do it, son!

07:13.458 --> 07:17.333

08:53.708 --> 08:55.208
-Sweetheart…
-How are you?

08:55.708 --> 08:56.708
I’m so happy!

09:04.541 --> 09:05.750
When do you go back?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.125
I’m not going back.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.458
It’s a transfer. Not leave.

09:10.958 --> 09:11.791
Great.

09:12.750 --> 09:13.875
No, not really, no.

09:14.916 --> 09:17.458
I graduated top of my class in training.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.416
I speak five languages.

09:21.333 --> 09:24.291
Just to pound the pavement
for Operation Sentinel.

09:25.875 --> 09:28.125
It’s not what I had in mind, you know.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.083
I get it.

09:31.916 --> 09:33.750
You’re with us. That’s what matters.

09:36.083 --> 09:38.541
Is the sixth-floor asshole still here?

09:38.625 --> 09:40.458
-Yeah.
-Is he bothering Mom?

09:41.083 --> 09:42.125
No, not so much.

10:12.041 --> 10:13.541
Let’s eat. I’m starving.

10:21.291 --> 10:24.541
My God. I can’t believe you’re here.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.500
You’re choking her.

10:30.166 --> 10:34.416
I made this dish for your dad for years.
It reminded him of his homeland.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.375
No!

10:35.458 --> 10:36.500
Seriously?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.916
Go on, eat.
You’re nothing but skin and bone.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.791
I’m not hungry. Here.

10:42.875 --> 10:43.791
Don’t want it?

10:43.875 --> 10:44.708
Later.

10:46.041 --> 10:47.041
Mom!

10:47.125 --> 10:48.875
-Mom, want some more?
-Later.

10:49.708 --> 10:50.708
More for me.

12:02.666 --> 12:05.916
You were prescribed
a powerful opioid for the migraines.

12:06.416 --> 12:08.458
Sedatives, too, and beta blockers.

12:11.250 --> 12:14.083
An explosive cocktail.
It’s easy to get addicted.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.541
Let’s make a deal, you and me.

12:16.625 --> 12:18.791
I’ll renew your prescription

12:18.875 --> 12:20.583
once you’ve seen a therapist.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.500
This is for your own good.

12:24.208 --> 12:25.208
We have a deal?

12:25.750 --> 12:28.000
-Okay.
-This is a colleague’s number.

12:32.125 --> 12:32.958
Thanks.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.541
-Hello, officer.
-Hello.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.250
Lieutenant Éric Jaubert.

13:19.333 --> 13:20.916
You’re under my command.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.708
Please, after you.

13:23.208 --> 13:24.166
It’s okay. Thanks.

13:27.833 --> 13:28.666
Lieutenant.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.791
-Hello.
-Hello.

14:12.166 --> 14:14.166
So, we patrol the Old Port.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.458
Next, we head to the canal.
Then we head down.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.708
That’s all we do around here.

14:35.541 --> 14:39.541
Like I said, the harbor,
then Place Garibaldi.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.416
-Who’s that guy?
-I don’t know!

15:28.500 --> 15:30.375
-Who’s that guy?
-Just a friend!

15:30.458 --> 15:31.750
-Help!
-Stop!

15:32.250 --> 15:33.083
Fuck…

15:33.833 --> 15:36.375
-Quick!
-Look at me when I’m talking to you!

15:36.458 --> 15:38.583
Send backup. Assault in progress.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.625
-You’re gonna get one!
-Her boyfriend’s hitting her!

15:44.291 --> 15:45.250
Quick!

15:45.333 --> 15:47.541
He’s drunk! He’s going to kill her.

15:47.625 --> 15:51.000
Sir, calm down!
The police have been called.

15:53.208 --> 15:55.041
I’m going to bash your head in!

15:56.666 --> 15:57.666
Wait!

15:59.625 --> 16:00.708
Warrant Officer!

16:02.875 --> 16:03.875
Warrant Officer!

16:05.916 --> 16:07.458
Hey! That’s not allowed!

16:58.625 --> 16:59.958
Are you okay, my love?

17:11.375 --> 17:12.500
It’s all right now.

17:13.791 --> 17:14.708
You’re with us.

17:15.458 --> 17:16.833
We’ll take care of you.

17:17.916 --> 17:18.750
Hey!

17:19.500 --> 17:22.166
We’re going out on Saturday.
Don’t back out.

18:35.916 --> 18:37.833
Hey! How’s it going, handsome?

18:40.125 --> 18:41.833
Can I get you a coffee? Yeah?

19:20.833 --> 19:21.791
Warrant Officer?

19:24.833 --> 19:25.666
You okay?

20:20.250 --> 20:21.750
Got any Oxy? Codeine?

20:22.833 --> 20:23.666
You a cop?

20:25.958 --> 20:27.708
-Codeine is 50.
-Okay.

20:28.916 --> 20:29.750
Stay there.

21:18.916 --> 21:20.625
What’s that? Is it new?

21:21.916 --> 21:23.291
Yeah. You like it?

21:23.916 --> 21:24.750
Love it.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.291
Cool.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.958
Don’t pull that face.

21:34.833 --> 21:36.208
-Okay. Let’s go.
-No.

21:36.291 --> 21:37.125
Look at me.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.541
-No.
-Yes.

21:40.416 --> 21:41.250
Smile.

21:42.208 --> 21:43.333
Stop it.

21:43.916 --> 21:45.416
I’m not a matryoshka.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.958
My girls!

21:48.583 --> 21:50.083
Yes, beautiful girls.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.333
-Let’s take a photo.
-Okay, then.

21:53.416 --> 21:54.625
That’s all I needed.

22:00.666 --> 22:01.583
Hey, girls!

22:05.833 --> 22:06.666
How are you?

22:10.666 --> 22:11.583
Hey,

22:11.666 --> 22:13.500
-you good?
-This is my sister.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.500
-The soldier!
-Yeah. Hello.

22:15.583 --> 22:16.500
-See you.
-Bye.

22:16.583 --> 22:17.416
Who is she?

22:17.500 --> 22:18.333
I forgot.

22:47.750 --> 22:48.875
Come on!

22:48.958 --> 22:50.250
-I’m dancing!
-No!

22:57.708 --> 22:58.708
Tania!

23:00.375 --> 23:01.375
-Hey!
-Tania.

23:02.291 --> 23:04.041
-You good?
-You okay, gorgeous?

23:04.125 --> 23:05.750
Yeah! This is my sister.

23:05.833 --> 23:06.958
-Hi.
-Hi.

23:07.041 --> 23:08.125
-Aurélien.
-Klara.

23:08.208 --> 23:09.041
Who’s that?

23:12.541 --> 23:14.208
-The Russians.
-Introduce me?

23:14.291 --> 23:15.250
Tania.

23:15.333 --> 23:16.666
Come on!

23:16.750 --> 23:17.666
Okay, then. Fine.

23:18.208 --> 23:19.333
I’ll be right back.

23:19.416 --> 23:22.083
-What? Where?
-She’s with me, don’t worry.

23:22.166 --> 23:23.000
Tania!

25:39.791 --> 25:41.333
YOU ALL RIGHT?

25:41.416 --> 25:43.750
WHERE ARE YOU?!

25:48.833 --> 25:49.666
Good morning.

25:50.750 --> 25:51.583
Hi.

25:52.750 --> 25:53.666
I have to go.

25:53.750 --> 25:54.833
We’ll talk?

25:55.958 --> 25:56.791
Of course.

26:12.833 --> 26:13.875
Open it up.

26:15.666 --> 26:18.458
-Can’t you see it’s empty?
-It’s an inspection.

26:18.958 --> 26:20.625
-What’s the box?
-Just a box.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.875
A jewelry box. You got a date? Open.

26:23.958 --> 26:25.000
Open the box.

26:25.916 --> 26:26.875
Show me the bag.

26:28.125 --> 26:30.666
-What’s this?
-Can’t you see they’re papers?

26:33.750 --> 26:35.583
-Nosy, aren’t you?
-It’s my job.

26:36.791 --> 26:39.041
The bag is fine. Spread your arms.

26:39.125 --> 26:41.208
-Carrying anything dangerous?
-No.

26:44.875 --> 26:47.208
-What are you doing here?
-Nothing…

27:54.958 --> 27:57.458
Drop it!

28:07.375 --> 28:08.416
Not a cop, huh?

28:13.375 --> 28:14.416
Get out of here.

28:15.291 --> 28:16.125
Go.

28:35.250 --> 28:36.333
He got away?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.625
-Sorry.
-Drive.

28:55.541 --> 28:57.166
-Here.
-Thanks.

29:20.625 --> 29:21.458
Hello?

29:38.416 --> 29:40.625
Excuse me, I’m looking for my sister.

29:59.833 --> 30:04.583
Your sister is in stage three coma
due to a cerebral edema.

30:04.666 --> 30:07.208
We can’t operate.
We’re trying to resorb it.

30:10.541 --> 30:11.375
I’m sorry.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.166
Hello.

30:37.750 --> 30:38.708
Captain Muller.

30:40.041 --> 30:41.208
Tania’s sister?

30:42.708 --> 30:43.750
You have a sec?

30:50.750 --> 30:52.375
She was found this morning.

30:53.458 --> 30:56.083
A passer-by found her.
She was at the beach.

30:58.125 --> 31:01.875
Preliminary examination indicates
that she was raped.

31:06.166 --> 31:07.666
Where was she last night?

31:08.708 --> 31:11.000
I was with her. At the Millenium.

31:12.625 --> 31:13.458
The nightclub?

31:14.166 --> 31:15.000
With friends?

31:16.166 --> 31:17.541
No, just the two of us.

31:19.208 --> 31:22.208
She left before me,
with some people I didn’t know.

32:14.958 --> 32:15.791
Have a good day.

32:22.416 --> 32:23.625
Are you okay?

32:28.791 --> 32:30.166
I heard about your sister.

32:31.000 --> 32:31.958
I’m sorry.

32:50.833 --> 32:52.083
I’ll be five minutes.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.833
You increase the capacity
by around 50 people…

33:02.916 --> 33:04.208
-Yes.
-At that point…

33:06.250 --> 33:07.625
You the boss?

33:07.708 --> 33:09.375
Yes, can I help you?

33:10.041 --> 33:12.791
I need the footage
on your security cameras.

33:12.875 --> 33:16.000
-I don’t get it. What for?
-Anti-terrorist squad.

33:23.458 --> 33:24.583
What are you after?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.500
How do I see that camera?

33:41.125 --> 33:42.666
Him. Do you know him?

33:42.750 --> 33:44.041
He was right there.

33:44.958 --> 33:46.291
Sure. He’s a regular.

33:48.208 --> 33:49.708
Who are you? What’s this?

33:51.000 --> 33:54.750
The police requisitioned this footage.
Go, or I’ll call them.

33:54.833 --> 33:55.875
Warrant Officer?

34:05.208 --> 34:07.458
-Everything okay?
-Yeah. Let’s go.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.083
You’re holding your breath. Don’t.
Try to breathe out when you shoot.

35:08.708 --> 35:09.541
Coffee?

35:30.291 --> 35:32.625
This is the man my sister left with.

35:32.708 --> 35:33.916
We need to find him.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.875
How did you get hold of this?

35:38.625 --> 35:40.541
This is a police investigation.

35:42.125 --> 35:43.916
Sorry. I couldn’t help myself.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.333
He’s Yvan Kadnikov.

35:48.166 --> 35:50.375
In addition to this footage,

35:50.458 --> 35:54.625
we also found your sister’s phone,
with pictures from that night.

35:54.708 --> 35:56.666
-You questioned him?
-Not yet.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.833
-I’ve made a request.
-What?

35:59.958 --> 36:02.291
Yvan Kadnikov is Leonid Kadnikov’s son.

36:02.875 --> 36:05.083
A tech genius who made a fortune.

36:05.166 --> 36:07.000
He’s influential, respected,

36:07.083 --> 36:09.000
and, some say, protected.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.875
Yvan has been hiding out
in his father’s villa.

36:13.958 --> 36:16.791
They both have diplomatic passports.

36:16.875 --> 36:19.125
The villa has consulate status.

36:19.208 --> 36:20.458
You can’t just get in.

36:23.958 --> 36:25.583
Shit. I have to go.

36:26.583 --> 36:28.500
Look, I’ll be honest with you.

36:29.166 --> 36:30.916
Rape cases are complicated.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.041
When Tania comes out of the coma,

36:33.125 --> 36:34.541
we’ll figure it out.

36:34.625 --> 36:35.791
Let’s go.

36:35.875 --> 36:37.083
I’ll update you.

37:50.166 --> 37:51.625
You only think of food.

40:29.291 --> 40:30.333
What are you doing?

41:28.375 --> 41:29.791
Have you lost your mind?

41:32.791 --> 41:33.791
Come on.

41:41.833 --> 41:42.666
Your weapon.

41:59.583 --> 42:00.416
Yeah.

42:10.291 --> 42:13.541
An experienced soldier
must be an example to the others.

42:13.625 --> 42:16.250
Stop getting high, Warrant Officer.

42:17.958 --> 42:19.500
This is the women’s locker room.

42:39.250 --> 42:41.291
-What can I get you?
-Vodka tonic.

42:41.375 --> 42:42.208
You got it.

43:10.208 --> 43:12.125
My sister’s in a coma.

43:12.208 --> 43:14.458
You left with her. What happened?

43:18.000 --> 43:18.833
Fuck.

43:28.375 --> 43:30.708
I’ll cut you unless you tell me.

43:30.791 --> 43:33.375
Stop, please. I did nothing.

43:33.458 --> 43:35.833
-Tell me what you did!
-It wasn’t me!

43:37.208 --> 43:38.208
Tell me.

43:38.291 --> 43:39.125
Yvan?

43:43.166 --> 43:44.000
Let him go.

45:18.666 --> 45:19.666
What’s this mess?

45:20.458 --> 45:21.375
I know you.

45:22.208 --> 45:23.875
Get this bitch out of here.

49:22.250 --> 49:23.208
Who are you?

49:24.666 --> 49:26.041
Why are you in my home?

49:30.000 --> 49:32.041
Your son raped my sister.

49:35.000 --> 49:35.833
It’s you.

49:38.708 --> 49:41.791
Yvan told me
about your exploits at the club.

49:43.250 --> 49:44.083
Well done!

49:45.791 --> 49:48.125
I should hire you as security.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.291
Yvan just left.

49:51.375 --> 49:52.708
He’s not here anymore.

49:54.416 --> 49:55.541
In any case,

49:56.166 --> 49:58.708
he doesn’t have much to do
with any of this.

50:00.041 --> 50:01.208
Much to my regret,

50:03.000 --> 50:04.375
my son Ivan…

50:05.833 --> 50:06.916
never liked girls.

50:17.208 --> 50:18.541
Your sister was here.

50:18.625 --> 50:20.625
She came with him and his friends.

50:22.041 --> 50:23.458
She drank my vodka…

50:24.333 --> 50:26.083
danced in my living room,

50:26.166 --> 50:28.958
she even swam half-naked in my pool!

50:30.208 --> 50:31.458
Right in front of me.

50:33.166 --> 50:34.000
So,

50:34.666 --> 50:35.583
let’s just say

50:36.208 --> 50:37.750
I’m not like my son.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.083
That little diamond tattoo of hers…

50:47.791 --> 50:48.833
I ate it.

51:08.333 --> 51:09.541
I’m sorry, my dear.

51:09.625 --> 51:11.333
I must take this call.

51:11.416 --> 51:14.333
I’ll leave you
in the company of these gentlemen.

51:14.416 --> 51:15.500
Hello?

52:04.500 --> 52:05.500
Shit!

52:29.916 --> 52:32.291
I WANT TO BE
THE NEW WIND AFTER THE STORM

52:51.166 --> 52:52.083
Hello?

53:18.083 --> 53:20.541
The young Russian, he’s innocent.

53:21.541 --> 53:22.375
I know.

53:26.250 --> 53:27.333
I want to forget.

53:29.500 --> 53:31.833
I’d been drinking. I went to his place.

53:32.750 --> 53:34.375
They’ll say I asked for it.

53:37.708 --> 53:39.208
It’s my word against his.

53:40.583 --> 53:41.708
No, don’t say that.

53:42.333 --> 53:45.583
If you press charges,
there will be an inquiry. A trial.

53:46.375 --> 53:48.500
And Kadnikov will be found guilty.

53:49.250 --> 53:50.291
Leonid Kadnikov.

53:52.125 --> 53:53.208
I know everything.

53:58.541 --> 54:01.125
I don’t want a trial
or my life on display.

54:03.500 --> 54:05.208
I can’t do that to Mom, see?

54:13.333 --> 54:14.875
He can’t get away with it.

54:16.250 --> 54:18.625
What he did to you, he’s done to others.

54:19.416 --> 54:20.500
He’ll do it again.

54:22.583 --> 54:23.583
You realize that?

54:27.500 --> 54:29.500
Leave me alone, please. I’m tired.

54:58.500 --> 55:00.875
…we return to our correspondent in Nice.

55:00.958 --> 55:02.833
Mr. Kadnikov!

55:02.916 --> 55:04.458
Going back to Russia?

55:04.541 --> 55:05.958
Business calls!

55:06.041 --> 55:10.458
But I couldn’t leave the city
without seeing this beautiful church.

55:10.541 --> 55:14.750
It’s been completely renovated
thanks to its generous Russian donors.

55:14.833 --> 55:16.416
Police sources say

55:16.500 --> 55:19.916
your son, Ivan,
is a suspect in a rape case here in Nice.

55:20.500 --> 55:24.125
My son, Yvan,
has nothing to do with that whole thing.

55:24.208 --> 55:27.041
Someone's trying to make some money
off of this.

55:28.041 --> 55:30.166
Is he hiding at the Georgian Embassy
in Paris,

55:30.250 --> 55:32.166
with your friend Andrey Baranov?

55:32.250 --> 55:37.250
Are you going back to Russia
so your son can escape the charges?

55:37.333 --> 55:39.958
Mr. Kadnikov! One last question!

55:40.041 --> 55:40.875
Mr. Kadnikov!

56:05.125 --> 56:06.125
What’s happening?

56:06.875 --> 56:07.708
An embolism.

56:08.208 --> 56:09.083
Tania!

56:10.791 --> 56:12.333
You leave. It’ll be okay.

56:13.041 --> 56:15.666
Oxygen. Five liters, continuous, via mask.

56:16.166 --> 56:17.750
Get a heparin pump ready.

56:18.416 --> 56:20.000
I’ve got this. Get out.

58:54.791 --> 58:56.250
Bitch.

59:51.083 --> 59:52.000
Police!

1:00:03.375 --> 1:00:04.375
Okay. Let’s go.

1:00:23.041 --> 1:00:24.541
-There you go.
-Thank you.

1:00:55.458 --> 1:00:57.875
-Hi.
-Hi. What are you doing here?

1:00:58.500 --> 1:00:59.500
I wanted to talk.

1:01:00.250 --> 1:01:01.083
Okay.

1:01:12.083 --> 1:01:13.583
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:01:20.291 --> 1:01:22.166
-What are you doing?
-The bag.

1:01:23.791 --> 1:01:24.625
Quick.

1:01:26.083 --> 1:01:27.208
Give me two Glocks.

1:01:28.666 --> 1:01:29.625
With ammo.

1:01:34.083 --> 1:01:35.750
-And two FAMAS.
-Yeah, okay.

1:01:37.458 --> 1:01:39.416
-Fuck… okay.
-With loaded magazines.

1:01:45.208 --> 1:01:46.250
Close the bag.

1:01:47.958 --> 1:01:48.958
You’re insane.

1:01:51.041 --> 1:01:52.041
Put it down.

1:01:53.416 --> 1:01:54.250
On your knees.

1:01:55.916 --> 1:01:58.250
Tie yourself up!

1:02:00.375 --> 1:02:01.750
Come on, quick.

1:02:08.625 --> 1:02:09.458
Don’t move.

1:02:24.125 --> 1:02:25.750
Listen, I’ll call you back.

1:02:26.250 --> 1:02:27.083
Okay?

1:02:28.750 --> 1:02:29.583
Yes…

1:03:29.916 --> 1:03:31.541
-Hello?
-Hello?

1:03:32.708 --> 1:03:33.541
How are you?

1:03:35.583 --> 1:03:37.416
I’d be better if you were here.

1:03:38.791 --> 1:03:39.708
Where are you?

1:03:41.041 --> 1:03:41.875
I left.

1:03:44.208 --> 1:03:45.041
Come back.

1:03:46.416 --> 1:03:47.500
Come back, please.

1:03:48.333 --> 1:03:49.458
It’s too late, Mom.

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.250
Are the police there?

1:03:54.791 --> 1:03:55.625
Klara?

1:03:55.708 --> 1:03:57.416
You’re making a huge mistake.

1:03:58.041 --> 1:04:00.000
Listen to your mother. Come back.

1:04:00.083 --> 1:04:02.041
The woman who tried to kill Tania

1:04:02.125 --> 1:04:02.958
is alive.

1:04:03.875 --> 1:04:05.583
She worked for Kadnikov.

1:04:06.583 --> 1:04:08.541
I promise he’ll be put on trial.

1:04:09.833 --> 1:04:10.666
No.

1:04:11.750 --> 1:04:13.291
He’ll pay for what he did.

1:04:14.458 --> 1:04:15.291
Right now.

1:06:12.583 --> 1:06:14.708
I’m on the third floor. It’s clear.

1:06:15.583 --> 1:06:17.125
Coming down to the second.

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:19.375
Understood. Coming your way.

1:07:00.166 --> 1:07:02.750
The police have closed all the exits.

1:07:03.416 --> 1:07:04.916
I want something to eat.

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:08.416
All you want to do is eat.
Okay, I’ll bring you something.

1:07:23.583 --> 1:07:24.666
Hey, listen.

1:07:26.125 --> 1:07:27.916
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, I do.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:31.041
Did you see the car I bought last week?

1:07:31.125 --> 1:07:32.375
Why do you need that?

1:07:32.458 --> 1:07:35.083
For driving women around.

1:07:35.916 --> 1:07:37.500
I prefer to walk.

1:07:51.666 --> 1:07:52.500
Dima, Sasha.

1:07:53.166 --> 1:07:54.333
What’s happening?

1:07:56.458 --> 1:07:57.958
Dima? Sasha?

1:07:58.500 --> 1:07:59.333
Are you there?

1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.250
Where are you? Help me!

1:08:55.291 --> 1:08:56.666
Get me out of here!

1:10:26.375 --> 1:10:27.375
What do you want?

1:10:28.708 --> 1:10:29.750
Money?

1:12:19.291 --> 1:12:21.416
Doctor! Get a doctor up here! Quick!

1:12:34.625 --> 1:12:37.708
DUBAI, THREE MONTHS LATER

1:13:23.541 --> 1:13:24.541
Yes, of course.

1:13:25.791 --> 1:13:28.125
Yes. I need his support.

1:13:28.750 --> 1:13:31.166
Understand? It’s important.
