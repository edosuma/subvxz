01:30.507 --> 01:32.800
Ten, nine...

01:33.218 --> 01:35.344
eight, seven...

01:35.596 --> 01:37.805
six, five...

01:38.057 --> 01:39.307
four...

01:39.641 --> 01:41.309
three, two...

01:41.727 --> 01:42.852
one!

02:36.115 --> 02:37.240
Here goes.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.159
Bravo, Mr. Van der Veer!

03:04.643 --> 03:07.145
- Yes, Mr. Van der Veer?
- We'll go to the penthouse.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.688
Stop by Battery Park.

03:30.127 --> 03:34.755
Roger, routing change.
Penthouse, ETA: 0615.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.050
What will Van der Veer do
at the Battery at 6:00 a.m.?

03:38.260 --> 03:40.511
- Visit his ancestors.
- Whatever he wants.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.932
Roger, Manhattan arrival.
All clear, Romulus.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.810
You've got sector five
read-out on three.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.841
Chris?

06:27.637 --> 06:28.721
Darling?

06:35.520 --> 06:36.729
Chris!

06:54.247 --> 06:55.873
Chris!

06:58.877 --> 07:01.003
Ha-ha-ha! You scared me!

07:07.844 --> 07:09.011
Darling!

07:11.765 --> 07:13.557
- Did you miss me?
- Yes.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.418
Pauline!

11:43.828 --> 11:44.953
Forget it, kid.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.165
Oh, good. Put him on.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.085
Good morning, it's Warren.
We got a problem.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.045
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.589
Well, there's a nightmare
down in the Battery.

11:56.007 --> 11:59.426
Three bodies.
Mutilation, possible sexual assault...

11:59.636 --> 12:01.804
some dismemberment.
Maybe even cannibalism.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.806
I'd love to see it, but I've....

12:04.307 --> 12:07.101
I'm late for Mass
and I got a heavy golf date.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.645
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, you'll see it, Dewey.

12:10.188 --> 12:14.149
It's very weird and it's very strange,
just like you. So it's back to work.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.777
- I'm leaving now. Are you in Staten Island?
- Yeah.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.790
Get your ass over there
as fast as you can.

12:18.890 --> 12:20.989
- How?
- Fly!

12:58.027 --> 13:00.028
- How are you?
- Fine.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.698
Food.

13:15.336 --> 13:19.506
- How can you eat that crap?
- It settles my stomach.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.218
Well?

13:23.428 --> 13:26.722
Nothing. I didn't find
anything aft, either.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.561
Come on, let's check this....

13:36.983 --> 13:38.150
So?

13:38.610 --> 13:40.027
So, what?

13:40.904 --> 13:43.906
So who got killed? The governor?

13:44.449 --> 13:48.619
Somebody bigger.
Christopher Van der Veer.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.663
Megabucks.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.249
Heir to the fortune,
maybe even the presidency.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.627
Heh, heh. So much for heirs.

13:57.796 --> 14:01.006
His bodyguard. His wife is over there.

14:05.470 --> 14:08.138
- Witnesses?
- If seagulls could talk, sure.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.142
- Kidnapping?
- No sign of a struggle.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.979
Take a look around.
See if you can sniff out anything.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.068
Does this mean I'm back on the job?

14:22.237 --> 14:25.280
- You're a detective, aren't you?
- I'll try and remember that.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.915
It's a good thing to happen on a Sunday.

14:29.015 --> 14:30.886
Oh, Christ!

14:31.037 --> 14:33.497
- Let me handle this.
- I always do.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.961
Commissioner. Mr. Mayor.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.866
You handled that nicely.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.855
This is just wonderful!
God knows what's next.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.233
- Where's the damn coroner?
- We haven't located him yet.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.027
I want him here!
Van der Veer was my friend.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.363
You've got your best man here already.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.491
Any more film, John?

15:12.328 --> 15:14.121
Warren, what the hell happened?

15:14.747 --> 15:17.708
It wasn't robbery.
Their money and jewelry weren't touched.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.418
There was some cocaine.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.797
Uh, party favors. But more than that....

15:24.382 --> 15:27.593
Two factors have the potential
to make this international, Mr. Mayor.

15:27.702 --> 15:29.887
Executions and terrorism.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.349
Hmm. Makes a bombing
seem like child's play.

15:34.559 --> 15:35.601
Excuse me.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.604
Dewey Wilson?

15:38.813 --> 15:41.815
Homicide, kidnapping and results.
I'm sorry, I don't know you.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.902
Jonathan Ross,
Bureau Chief of Executive Security.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.196
His firm's responsible for some
of the top executives in the world.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.865
They have resources we don't have.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.535
No matter how sophisticated
technology gets, there's no guarantee.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.915
God, it stinks down here.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.880
Severely inflicted wounds....

16:09.928 --> 16:13.180
Oh-ho. Dew! The old jogging trip?

16:13.389 --> 16:17.893
The six month's annual bionic,
shed-the-twenty-pounds marathon resolve.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.479
Sound mind, sound body.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.398
You got to get into chemicals.
They keep you going.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.778
Your body will malfunction on you
one way or another.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.404
Yeah. Tell me about it.

16:31.449 --> 16:32.616
Wanna peek?

16:33.785 --> 16:36.078
Something to tell
your grandchildren about.

16:37.455 --> 16:40.457
Took his brain. What the hell
do you suppose they did with it?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.502
- Maybe they dribbled it down Wall Street.
- Come here.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.504
I got a hand in a baggie.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.635
It belongs to that guy over there.
Had a gun in it.

16:52.804 --> 16:56.431
SR says he didn't even get a shot off.
How's that for fast?

16:57.392 --> 16:58.684
Fraternity ring?

16:59.310 --> 17:01.979
Pentagram and a goat. Voodoo.

17:02.772 --> 17:03.939
Yeah?

17:30.174 --> 17:31.591
Now, ain't this a shame?

17:32.176 --> 17:34.803
Bizarre, man.
It almost severed her head.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.017
- It was instantaneous?
- Instantaneous?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.687
You seen a chicken run around
with its head cut off?

17:44.856 --> 17:46.940
Hey, nobody ever thinks about the head.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.777
During the French Revolution,
when they chopped heads off...

17:50.987 --> 17:53.989
they'd pick them out the basket
and look them in the face.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.158
Most went out right away, in shock.

17:56.367 --> 17:59.286
Every fifth head or so was alive.
Wide awake...

17:59.954 --> 18:02.831
eyes blinking,
mouth trying to say something.

18:03.041 --> 18:03.999
Yeah, sure.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.835
The brain can live without oxygen
for more than a minute.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.503
That's a long time, buddy boy.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.423
How'd you like to see your own body
and know you're dead?

18:12.341 --> 18:14.342
Give me a nice death in bed.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.387
Preferably with a partner.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.183
You can take her away now.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.232
Hey, careful with her...

18:30.610 --> 18:32.861
- Oh, shit.
- Head.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.532
- You pick it up.
- I'm not picking it up.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.367
Jesus Christ.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.746
Well, let's see what happened to my man.

19:26.624 --> 19:29.126
Two bullet holes upside the head.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.463
See! You shouldn't have been fucking
with that bitch.

19:35.466 --> 19:38.927
You going to push, man?
I'm working by myself today, right?

19:39.137 --> 19:41.471
Ain't nobody working but me. Shit!

19:46.811 --> 19:49.688
- Another hot Saturday night.
- I heard that.

19:50.857 --> 19:54.442
- What's today's special?
- Tennis shoes and jock straps.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.029
A lot of joggers
are going out of business.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.532
You check out that dude yet?

20:06.497 --> 20:07.956
Dew!

20:09.125 --> 20:12.460
Weird shit happening here, man.
Give us a few more minutes.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.965
- How's it going, captain?
- Okay.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.034
Why do I always have
to get the hard ones?

21:21.239 --> 21:23.865
There's nothing there.
There's nothing there!

21:26.202 --> 21:27.661
Hey, Dew.

21:28.805 --> 21:32.916
The chief will tell him what we got.
Severance of the jugular and carotids...

21:33.125 --> 21:34.751
destruction of the esophagus.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.420
Lethal trauma on the throats,
resulting in....

21:37.630 --> 21:40.215
But what's really interesting
is what we haven't got.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.558
There's not a trace of metal.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.732
You know how every piece of metal,
no matter how sharp or smooth...

21:57.942 --> 21:59.901
will leave a residue when it cuts.

22:00.236 --> 22:03.571
It could be as finite as dust.
Soft x-ray should pick it up.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.326
Nothing.

22:09.745 --> 22:13.540
And nothing softer could have ripped
and ravaged like this.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.128
Some plastic weapon?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.631
Synthetics.

22:24.218 --> 22:27.220
I don't think there's any way
I could check that.

22:32.143 --> 22:35.979
You know, Dew, you could use a haircut.
Want to lie down?

22:36.397 --> 22:38.106
Not till it's my turn.

22:46.657 --> 22:47.949
How's it going?

22:48.951 --> 22:49.993
Identification?

22:51.203 --> 22:54.164
- My face.
- I need credentials.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.877
All that separates you from a guard dog
is a brain.

23:00.338 --> 23:01.838
Okay, captain.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.299
Good dog!

23:05.343 --> 23:07.677
- Hey, Dewey. What's happening?
- Hi, captain.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.308
- What's this?
- ME's report.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.310
Oh, yeah? What's with the morgue?

23:16.187 --> 23:18.146
No answers to a lot of questions.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.652
- Is that it?
- That's it.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.654
What's the matter with you? You bored?

23:26.864 --> 23:29.449
I'm thinking.
You're just not used to the expression.

23:29.867 --> 23:33.495
Oh. Dungeman? Did you find out
what they were doing there?

23:33.704 --> 23:36.456
Anniversary party
with 100 of their closest friends.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.375
We know, we're checking the guest list.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.168
Big party at the family compound.

23:40.378 --> 23:43.254
It breaks up at 5:00 a.m.
They head back to their penthouse.

23:43.714 --> 23:45.673
A little pearl gift...

23:46.384 --> 23:51.179
a little booze, a little drugs.
They decide to boogie.

23:52.014 --> 23:53.473
They were married there.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.768
- How do you know that?
- I asked.

23:59.063 --> 24:02.232
- You really are thinking.
- It's better than the Sunday crossword.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.691
Maybe.

24:04.193 --> 24:07.654
- Any Jack the Rippers out there?
- No psychos missing from the loony bins.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.865
If it is the Ripper,
the ME can't find a trace of any weapon.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.200
What?

24:12.535 --> 24:13.868
Who knows?

24:14.245 --> 24:17.539
The Filipinos remove organs
with their hands.

24:18.749 --> 24:21.209
- That driver was a Haitian, right?
- Yeah.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.920
One tough son of a bitch.
Worth three normals.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.881
Ex-Papa Doc Secret Police.
Ton Ton Macoute.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.843
Van der Veer had a big liquor
import business in the islands.

24:30.052 --> 24:32.387
How that Haitian gets jumped
beats the shit out of me.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.930
You check the voodoo angle?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.850
Voodoo? There's 80
goddamn sects in Manhattan alone.

24:37.059 --> 24:40.061
Come here, I want to show you something.
The meat and potatoes.

24:40.271 --> 24:43.398
Business and political enemies.
Fuchek, what do you got?

24:44.233 --> 24:47.444
Business enemies he ain't got.
Just one big corporate family.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.071
Political, well, there's the action.

24:50.573 --> 24:53.032
The family's got interests
on every continent.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.243
Funding a government overthrow.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.229
Putting a mine in some holy ground.
Moving a town.

24:58.339 --> 25:00.415
A real friend of the Third World.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.417
International terrorism, huh?

25:05.504 --> 25:06.754
Mr. Ross.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.721
- You got quadrant four secured already?
- Yes, I do.

25:21.979 --> 25:25.482
- Punch me up 20 on this.
- Roger, 20.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.609
Got a demo run faction.

25:27.818 --> 25:31.029
File facts negative so far.
Unknown radical connections.

25:31.622 --> 25:33.948
Wait, wait. Give me the stats on 20.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.573
Well, hello!
That's Van der Veer's niece.

25:37.673 --> 25:39.696
Have the police pick her up.

25:45.836 --> 25:47.128
Give me 20.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.057
Somewhere in the world,
every other day...

25:59.350 --> 26:02.977
a corporate executive is kidnapped
or assassinated...

26:03.187 --> 26:05.647
netting ransoms
in excess of $1 billion...

26:05.856 --> 26:09.901
and forcing the expenditure of $50 billion
in corporate security measures.

26:11.028 --> 26:15.240
Transnational terrorism would rival
their victims in profit if you guys....

26:15.449 --> 26:16.658
I want her.

26:17.284 --> 26:21.371
...the case of Joseph Richmond, central
chemical plant manager in Columbia.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.039
Yeah?

26:23.249 --> 26:24.249
Good morning.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.668
Hi! Good morning. Come in. Sit down.

26:27.419 --> 26:31.005
I was reading the response you got
on that Psychology of Violence report.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.174
- That must be very gratifying.
- Yes, it is.

26:33.384 --> 26:34.509
Good.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.804
I'm teaming you up with Dewey Wilson
on the Van der Veer case.

26:38.013 --> 26:41.432
I didn't know he was back.
I thought he retired. Disabled. Mental?

26:43.143 --> 26:46.938
He had a lot of family problems.
He started to drink a little too much. He....

26:47.147 --> 26:50.650
Police work piled up on him.
He's a good man. You'll like him.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.485
Okay, fine.

26:52.736 --> 26:56.531
We also had a little break this morning.
Van der Veer's niece was picked up.

26:57.241 --> 27:00.451
She's Weather Underground.
I want you to chat her up.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.079
Put her on your machine.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

27:04.748 --> 27:09.002
So, what's new on the international
mutilation front? Run down the list.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.590
Well, kneecappings, Red Brigade, Italy.

27:13.799 --> 27:17.010
Slashed Achilles tendons,
eyes gouged out, ears cut off...

27:17.219 --> 27:18.386
Red Army faction.

27:18.596 --> 27:22.056
Let's see, PFLP, Carlos,
Baader, Tuperamos...

27:22.474 --> 27:24.684
Fifth Estate, a few decapitations.

27:25.269 --> 27:28.313
The Uno Mondo.
They slash off the male genitalia.

27:29.106 --> 27:32.150
The cock and balls.
They stuff them in their victim's mouth.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.782
- You ever seen anybody killed?
- Pardon me?

27:39.992 --> 27:43.077
Somebody's insides on a wall?
Hold your nose.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.624
So who collects brains?

27:48.951 --> 27:50.877
It's probably a symbol.

27:51.670 --> 27:55.131
Miss Rensselaer
probably went to Radcliffe...

27:55.633 --> 27:57.592
and took a course in symbolism.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.844
What is your full name?

28:00.054 --> 28:02.221
Cicely Marie Rensselaer.

28:02.431 --> 28:04.766
- What city are we in?
- That's a good question.

28:05.934 --> 28:09.187
- Well, what city?
- We're in New York, aren't we?

28:09.647 --> 28:10.855
We're in New York.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.487
What are you watching?

28:17.696 --> 28:21.199
She is an urban guerrilla
fighting the just war...

28:21.492 --> 28:23.868
against all us fascist swine.

28:24.453 --> 28:28.197
And she is a chain-jerked...

28:28.999 --> 28:33.252
pussy of an amoral society.
Well, that's what she's just been called.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.297
What is this crap?
Am I on some kind of a lie detector?

28:37.299 --> 28:38.966
You know that would be illegal.

28:39.076 --> 28:43.096
Yeah, the whole room's a lie detector.
This is a high-end infrared imager.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.139
Well, you were always a good kid....

28:45.391 --> 28:48.434
The register's heat changes
in the 8 to 12 micron range.

28:48.644 --> 28:52.522
Thermo-graphic systems equipment,
voice analyzers.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.733
Computers and recorders are back there.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.986
Micro-frequency levels
indicate psychological stress.

28:59.196 --> 29:02.490
These things should be monitoring
Congress and the White House.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.117
Country would grind to a halt.

29:04.326 --> 29:07.161
This stuff's all remote. Covert.
You don't hook them up with...

29:07.371 --> 29:09.247
a bandage on the arm and a sweat meter.

29:09.456 --> 29:13.126
One death is a tragedy. A million
is a statistic. You tell me about our wars.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.294
Tell me about three deaths.

29:18.382 --> 29:19.841
Three deaths?

29:21.510 --> 29:22.552
Well?

29:26.140 --> 29:27.598
She's hiding something.

29:34.356 --> 29:38.317
Did you, or anyone you know, participate
in the murder of Christopher Van der Veer?

29:42.865 --> 29:44.365
That's one startled kid.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.367
Are you aware of any information...

29:46.577 --> 29:50.204
about the murder
of Christopher and Pauline Van der Veer?

29:56.920 --> 29:58.546
It wasn't a murder, Rebecca.

29:58.756 --> 30:00.047
It wasn't a murder, Rebecca.

30:00.257 --> 30:01.799
It was an execution.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.093
Jesus Christ!

30:04.303 --> 30:06.220
It was an execution.

30:07.556 --> 30:11.225
It wasn't a murder, Rebecca.
It was an execution.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.061
She's lying.
She knows nothing about the murders.

30:15.397 --> 30:19.692
Got you. Urban guerilla.
Till your goddamn trust fund runs out.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.695
- You're sure she's lying?
- Absolutely.

30:23.989 --> 30:28.534
- Great! Now where does that leave us?
- Like this just didn't happen.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.318
I got to get straight.
What'll you give me for it?

33:17.829 --> 33:19.288
No Hustler pinups!

33:19.831 --> 33:22.375
I don't think
this has anything to do with terrorism.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.127
What does it have to do with?

33:25.837 --> 33:28.214
- Paranoia.
- Paranoia?

33:28.840 --> 33:32.343
Your people want it to be political.
It justifies your existence.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.178
She was a logical suspect.

33:34.805 --> 33:36.305
What weapon did that?

33:36.974 --> 33:40.810
Why hasn't anybody called the press?
Especially for such a beautiful job.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.480
They all don't right away.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.487
You want a shot?

33:53.198 --> 33:56.450
- Have you got any ice?
- Only in my heart.

34:07.504 --> 34:10.130
"God, guns and guts...

34:10.424 --> 34:14.510
made America. Let's keep all three."

34:15.554 --> 34:17.388
Why are you a cop?

34:18.056 --> 34:21.976
Oh, I like to kill. It's a habit
I picked up and it's....

34:22.393 --> 34:23.936
It's hard to shake.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.398
Killed anyone lately?

34:28.025 --> 34:31.318
Well, I tried to kill a rabbit this morning,
but it went down a hole.

34:32.362 --> 34:33.821
What do you make of that?

34:34.281 --> 34:37.574
Well, something sexual, I suppose.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.714
Good night, Dewey.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.382
Good night, Rebecca.

34:54.259 --> 34:57.845
- Where are you staying?
- A company apartment.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.431
Got a ride?

35:01.183 --> 35:02.558
- You asking?
- Yeah.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.101
No.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.436
You want one?

35:07.022 --> 35:08.689
Not tonight.

35:59.866 --> 36:00.908
Stop! Stop!

36:07.165 --> 36:08.457
Jesus Christ!

36:10.585 --> 36:12.128
Over here! Come over here!

36:13.130 --> 36:14.922
Come on, man, hurry!

36:15.132 --> 36:16.966
Come on, let's take a look.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.634
Cesspool! Look at this sewer!

36:18.844 --> 36:21.470
Jesus Christ! Didn't expect
that kind of work in here.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.431
Hey, you guys, come over here
and take a look at this.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.863
How many houses
did the Van der Veers have?

36:39.072 --> 36:41.782
Locust Valley,
Long Island, the Bahamas...

36:41.992 --> 36:44.952
Johannesburg, Rome, San Francisco...

36:45.162 --> 36:47.454
and this little pied-à-terre.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.040
Peter Van der Veer.

36:54.504 --> 36:56.881
And old John Joachim, himself.

36:58.425 --> 37:01.468
He even looks like God!
Except his hands are in his pockets.

37:01.678 --> 37:05.139
They'd better be! He's got
about four dead presidents in them.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.944
Mrs. Van der Veer painted this?

37:19.529 --> 37:23.449
- Oh. It's such a disturbing picture.
- It sure disturbs me.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.744
- She was asking for help.
- With her art lessons.

37:29.331 --> 37:30.706
It's not me.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.792
- Got a phone I could use?
- On the desk.

37:48.892 --> 37:50.267
What's this?

37:50.977 --> 37:55.064
Mr. Van der Veer's real estate project.
Groundbreaking ceremony was Saturday.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.315
- Whittington.
- Dew.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.567
They found some body parts
in the South Bronx.

37:58.777 --> 38:02.363
- What's the South Bronx got to do...
- This is hot, man! Meet me at Baldy's.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.406
I'll be right there.

38:05.450 --> 38:09.703
We've got hair files on every race running,
plus your basic sub-flavors.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.998
Facial, axillary, chest, pubic.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.126
They're all different. All identifiable.

38:16.670 --> 38:18.879
The one on the left came off
the Bronx kidney.

38:19.089 --> 38:23.175
The one on the right was found
on Pauline Van der Veer.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.761
Identical.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.722
A hair is like a fingerprint.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.392
And those two came from the same source.

38:32.602 --> 38:33.894
What are they?

38:35.146 --> 38:38.732
Captain, they don't match anything I have.
All I know is they ain't human.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.026
And in New York?

38:41.403 --> 38:44.446
South Bronx and Wall Street.
What's the connection?

38:45.490 --> 38:46.740
They're both dead.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.034
- Thanks, Baldy.
- Thank you.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.954
- See you, Baldy.
- Keep combing it.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.580
Yeah.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.655
My God!

39:48.803 --> 39:52.723
- I haven't been in a church in years.
- Lost your faith?

39:53.516 --> 39:56.685
No. I got married in one.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.771
Is he still around?

39:58.980 --> 40:00.147
Not anymore.

40:02.817 --> 40:04.735
I was an altar boy once.

40:05.695 --> 40:09.656
An old nun ran the show.
Used to beat the shit out of me.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.375
- Take a look inside?
- No, thanks.

40:24.881 --> 40:27.424
- What was that?
- What?

40:27.717 --> 40:30.010
That sound. Like a baby.

40:30.553 --> 40:33.680
There! Inside.

41:38.663 --> 41:42.666
"The devil on one shoulder,
an angel on the other."

41:44.085 --> 41:46.920
- What?
- Let's get out of here.

41:53.636 --> 41:54.928
Did you hear that?

41:57.140 --> 41:58.432
Wind.

44:50.813 --> 44:53.607
Oh. I haven't been to a place like this
since school.

44:53.816 --> 44:55.984
You really know
how to treat a woman, Wilson.

44:56.194 --> 44:57.736
This isn't a date, Neff.

44:59.197 --> 45:00.697
What do you think it was?

45:06.913 --> 45:08.205
Kids.

45:08.623 --> 45:09.956
Junkies.

45:11.250 --> 45:13.710
Hallucinations. I don't know.

45:24.639 --> 45:26.264
Have you killed anyone?

45:28.226 --> 45:29.851
Well, I wounded someone.

45:30.353 --> 45:35.649
I shot a rookie in the leg, cleaning my gun
in the locker room second week in uniform.

45:38.027 --> 45:39.152
Have you?

45:40.029 --> 45:41.988
Why don't you ask how many?

47:07.283 --> 47:08.784
Thank you.

47:44.237 --> 47:45.779
Dew.

50:16.806 --> 50:20.767
You sure it wasn't a snake?
New Yorkers just ape-shit about snakes.

50:21.227 --> 50:24.854
You see, you don't have to walk them.
Cobras, pythons, boas, rattlers.

50:25.189 --> 50:27.607
You got more snakes in the Apple
than in the Amazon.

50:28.150 --> 50:30.485
The Medical Examiner
sends us dozens to identify.

50:30.695 --> 50:33.530
They're coming up out of the toilets,
biting people on the ass.

50:33.739 --> 50:37.617
Course, snakes don't have hairs.
You people got something with hairs.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.996
Yes. Any idea what it is?

50:41.205 --> 50:45.375
It's a carnivore. You got yourself
some kind of meat-eater. A bear.

50:45.584 --> 50:47.711
A cat. Something like that.

50:49.422 --> 50:52.757
Nature works. We don't.
The basic unit's flawed.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.677
Someday the earth will blow away
like an ash anyway, right?

50:55.886 --> 50:57.345
Tilt, bzzt, gone.

50:58.431 --> 51:00.724
Goodbye, diet dog food!

51:02.268 --> 51:04.811
The hair on the left
was found in Manhattan.

51:05.021 --> 51:07.230
The hair on the right,
in the South Bronx.

51:07.648 --> 51:09.983
- Canis lupus.
- Canis lupus?

51:10.693 --> 51:13.069
Yeah. You want to meet him?

51:17.033 --> 51:19.534
Wake up, boy. We got friends for lunch.
Come on. Down, boy.

51:26.292 --> 51:29.127
- Those are wolf hairs?
- Ah, you bet!

51:29.378 --> 51:31.171
I can't quite place the subspecies.

51:31.380 --> 51:33.631
They were 40-odd, but it's lupine.

51:33.841 --> 51:35.341
Any wild around New York?

51:36.052 --> 51:39.846
No. I wish. We wiped them out
around the turn of the century in the east.

51:40.389 --> 51:43.349
They went the way of the Indians.
The Genocide Express.

51:43.559 --> 51:46.227
There used to be millions.
Now just a few in the Rockies.

51:46.437 --> 51:49.189
- What are you trying to pin on the big bad?
- A murder case.

51:50.232 --> 51:52.025
What? A hitman in a fur coat?

51:52.485 --> 51:54.444
Hairs were found on the victim.

51:56.864 --> 51:58.490
With all the psychos in New York...

51:58.699 --> 52:01.034
you're trying to pin this
on an endangered species?

52:01.243 --> 52:03.495
Could a wolf do that?

52:04.038 --> 52:06.456
- You're serious?
- Mm-hm.

52:09.293 --> 52:11.169
No way. These aren't animal wounds.

52:11.378 --> 52:14.047
- Could you train a wolf?
- Then it wouldn't be a wolf.

52:14.590 --> 52:15.799
Absolutely not.

52:16.092 --> 52:19.761
People kill people.
Wolves don't kill people. That's a myth.

52:20.054 --> 52:22.680
I mean, they're too smart.
They're like Indians.

52:24.100 --> 52:27.560
Wolves and Indians evolved
and were destroyed simultaneously.

52:27.895 --> 52:30.105
Their societies are
practically one and the same.

52:30.314 --> 52:32.273
They're tribal.
They look out for their own.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.818
They don't overpopulate,
and they're superb hunters.

52:39.448 --> 52:42.242
- Do you know anything about NAM?
- As in Viet?

52:42.451 --> 52:46.871
As in Native American Movement.
Broken Elbow, Wounded Knee?

52:47.456 --> 52:49.874
Very little.
They haven't been active in our area.

52:50.626 --> 52:53.253
I doubt Indians
have anything to do with this.

52:53.754 --> 52:54.921
Eddie Holt.

52:55.297 --> 52:57.674
- Who's he?
- The Crazy Horse of the '70s.

52:58.968 --> 53:01.427
The only one
of our local militants left alive...

53:01.637 --> 53:04.264
who's not making money
off of Levi commercials.

53:05.057 --> 53:09.561
I arrested him and his friends
before they blew up Federal Hall.

53:10.146 --> 53:11.938
The $24 deed was in there?

53:12.815 --> 53:15.817
He did four years for manslaughter.
Killed an Apple.

53:16.026 --> 53:16.985
What's an Apple?

53:17.194 --> 53:20.238
A conservative Indian.
Red on the outside, white inside.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.866
He's been out about six months.

53:23.325 --> 53:24.909
Why would he kill Van der Veer?

53:25.119 --> 53:28.913
Maybe they want Manhattan back.
Van der Veer owned a hell of a chunk of it.

53:29.081 --> 53:30.832
Motivation's your department.

53:31.125 --> 53:33.126
- Where is he now?
- On the steel.

53:33.335 --> 53:34.294
What's that?

53:34.503 --> 53:38.298
High steel. The Indians build
most of the bridges and skyscrapers.

53:40.384 --> 53:42.177
- You're looking for Eddie?
- Yeah.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.763
- He's up there.
- Can you bring him down?

53:46.223 --> 53:48.600
I will. In about four hours.

53:49.685 --> 53:52.312
You want to talk to him? Go on up.

53:53.022 --> 53:55.481
You want to wait, the bar's over there.

53:55.733 --> 53:58.193
- Where are the stairs?
- There aren't any.

54:24.178 --> 54:25.136
Okay, take it up.

54:25.346 --> 54:29.349
Bolt it down facing the East Side.
Come on, Rainbow, pull. Pull!

54:49.453 --> 54:52.038
So you guys do have a head for heights.

54:52.248 --> 54:54.374
Just like we're born alcoholics, huh?

54:55.251 --> 54:57.877
You want to be a hero,
you get yourself a hero's job.

54:58.087 --> 55:03.591
- Keeping out of trouble up here, Eddie?
- Best I can. I got a good job and good pay.

55:03.842 --> 55:06.302
Parlez-vous politics on the side?

55:07.221 --> 55:08.429
Politics?

55:09.807 --> 55:11.766
You live in the past as much as I do.

55:16.647 --> 55:19.232
Little smoking, little drinking.
That's about it.

55:22.111 --> 55:23.403
You keep in touch?

55:23.737 --> 55:27.282
With what?
The guy next door, your mother, what?

55:27.533 --> 55:29.075
- Mother Nature.
- Sure.

55:29.743 --> 55:32.078
I can swim like a fish
and I fuck like a bunny.

55:32.830 --> 55:35.206
- I can shift with the best of them.
- Shift?

55:35.416 --> 55:37.375
Shape-shift. We do it for kicks.

55:37.584 --> 55:40.586
- Oh, yeah?
- Turn ourselves into a different animal.

55:41.797 --> 55:44.924
- One night a salmon, next night a deer.
- Or a wolf?

55:48.512 --> 55:49.554
Sure.

55:57.146 --> 55:58.896
Or an eagle.

56:01.317 --> 56:04.610
Come on, Dewey.
Just flap your arms and jump. It's easy.

56:05.946 --> 56:08.406
Go on. It's all in the head.

56:11.910 --> 56:13.286
That'd be murder.

56:13.579 --> 56:17.790
- You wouldn't kill anyone else, would you?
- That's what they pay you to find out.

57:03.670 --> 57:04.921
He works for us.

57:05.881 --> 57:08.466
- Eddie Holt works for ESS?
- Indirectly.

57:09.635 --> 57:12.178
He was installing
communication equipment for us.

57:12.388 --> 57:15.223
But what's really interesting
is that he was on the bridge...

57:15.432 --> 57:17.683
when the Van der Veer's crossed
Sunday morning.

57:17.893 --> 57:21.854
He showed up at about 5:00 a.m.,
drunk or stoned...

57:22.064 --> 57:23.648
or maybe it was an act.

57:24.400 --> 57:27.193
Strange bird.
He's always up on those bridges.

57:28.028 --> 57:29.529
The guards thought nothing of it.

57:29.738 --> 57:31.906
They watch him
through night-viewing devices.

57:32.825 --> 57:34.200
He just sits up there.

57:34.785 --> 57:36.202
Talking to ancestors.

57:36.620 --> 57:41.416
- He didn't come any nearer to the Battery?
- Not that anybody saw.

57:43.043 --> 57:45.503
Maybe they didn't recognize him.

59:03.999 --> 59:05.875
Don't do that kind of shit, man!

59:06.084 --> 59:08.336
So you ghouls do get the creeps
down here.

59:09.713 --> 59:11.088
What's he have to say?

59:11.507 --> 59:14.467
No, it's what Ferguson will say.
He's on his way down.

59:15.385 --> 59:17.512
These Bronx parts
are mighty interesting.

59:17.930 --> 59:20.806
They come from eight different people,
and each one of them....

59:21.016 --> 59:23.768
Now stand by,
every fucking piece is diseased.

59:24.269 --> 59:27.146
Cirrhotic liver, cancerous lung,
diseased heart....

59:27.356 --> 59:28.481
Hospital garbage.

59:29.441 --> 59:32.527
A heart, liver, you can't live without them.
Why take them out?

59:32.736 --> 59:33.945
So mutilation...

59:34.154 --> 59:38.407
Well, that's what I'm thinking too,
until Sayad here shows me his card.

59:40.077 --> 59:41.410
Look at this.

59:41.954 --> 59:44.622
Those faint striation patterns
on his throat...

59:44.873 --> 59:48.042
and on his wrists, and on those parts.
They're all identical.

59:48.544 --> 59:49.835
They're all alike.

59:50.045 --> 59:51.629
Not cuts.

59:52.214 --> 59:53.631
Tears.

59:54.383 --> 59:57.176
- You mean, like teeth?
- Very sharp teeth.

59:59.972 --> 01:00:02.557
Something out there
might be eating people.

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:07.812
- But not eating those.
- Right. Right.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.732
Right. They're not eating these.
And how do they know they're diseased?

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:16.028
It took me 24 hours with all this shit
I got to work with here to find that out.

01:00:16.405 --> 01:00:18.823
- Must be smart.
- Damn smart.

01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:21.033
It's a predator.

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:28.040
One with two feet and a warped brain.
Homo sapiens. The worst in the lot.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:31.043
Cannibalism? People eating people?

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:34.422
Come on, Fergie,
those aren't human teeth marks.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.762
Fergie, come on around here, man.
And look at these striations in the scope.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.645
Now, that's off his wrist.
That's from the throat.

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:52.523
- Is it an animal?
- Maybe.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:54.108
Well, it ain't human.

01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:58.696
Shape-shifting.

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:06.287
The body's just a physical expression
of the soul.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.914
The soul can shift the body
into any shape it wants.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.833
Kind of survival of the shiftiest.

01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:13.586
- What is that shit?
- Reality is just a state of mind.

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:16.881
- You change the mind, you can change the...
- Fergie! Please!

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.092
The striations, man, in the scope.

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:25.931
I just got here. Give me time.

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:28.851
What are you,
double-parked or something?

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.563
- What else you got?
- Well, I got my Bronx liver.

01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:34.482
You done a phosphoresus on this?

01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:38.361
I missed dinner for this.
You want to order a pizza?

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.613
No, man, I feel like some ribs.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:50.539
- Hey.
- Hey what?

01:02:03.512 --> 01:02:05.096
Good day.

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:48.819
Dewey, I told you, man.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.281
It's all in the head.

01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:43.916
When a wolf pack confronts
a moose, their eyes lock.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.961
If the moose stands its ground,
the wolves will pass.

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:49.755
If he runs,
this tells the wolf he's ready to die.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.260
Jaw pressure:
1500 pounds per square inch.

01:06:55.804 --> 01:06:58.055
Pulverizing bones
as big as baseball bats.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.641
Auditory range: 100,000 cycles.

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:03.268
Bat sonar down to earth tremors.

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:08.148
Visual acuity:
20 over 1.2 at 0.5 lumens, starlight.

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:12.695
Range: 100 millimicrons ultraviolet
to 2000 millimicrons infrared.

01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:14.613
Heat vision.

01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:23.163
Maximum speed: 40 miles per hour.

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:34.651
Yeah, hello, I want to report a fire.

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:36.069
Yeah, fire.

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:39.113
64th Street and Fifth Avenue.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:43.618
I don't know the number.
The building's in blazes. You can't miss it.

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:45.953
It's at 64th Street and Fifth Avenue.

01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:47.206
Yeah.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:50.459
Oh, yeah. I'm Peter. Peter Wolf.

01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:52.502
Wolf, yeah.

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:54.880
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, hurry, bye.

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:58.986
I knew you were here.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:21.508
Oh, my God!

01:13:50.218 --> 01:13:51.510
What is it?

01:13:57.392 --> 01:13:58.850
Is it Eddie Holt?

01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:02.534
It's all very weird, Dew.
And it ain't just New York.

01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:08.039
I started out
with just Newark and Philly...

01:17:08.249 --> 01:17:11.251
cross-referencing spare parts rooms
with their ME reports.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.878
Dew! We got verification on our M.O.!

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:18.300
New Orleans came up with a hair!
A goddamn Canis lupis hair.

01:17:28.603 --> 01:17:30.770
On a diseased human liver.

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:32.689
And I'm checking other cities.

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:34.733
Do you realize
how many people disappear?

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:36.985
Vanish every year without a trace?

01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:40.405
I think I know where they're going.

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:56.087
No, man, no.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:00.216
I don't know, between me and Fergie,
last I spoke to him...

01:18:01.135 --> 01:18:04.638
we can't come up with anything
that's got the capacity to do all this.

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:06.931
Have you seen Professor Ferguson?

01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:12.062
Okay. Solid, solid.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:17.359
Fergie never went home last night.
His mother called up. Freaked out!

01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:19.694
What is this?

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.617
Maybe we should put out
an All Points on him.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.495
- Victim or suspect?
- Fergie?

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:31.331
No, man. I know Fergie for five years.

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.834
He's weird, but he ain't that weird.

01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:38.463
Maybe we should show this
to the commissioner.

01:18:38.673 --> 01:18:41.591
Show what? How about some corroboration?

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:44.678
You get slammed
into a psychiatric review board....

01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:49.432
You know, man, this is....
And you can't eat just one.

01:18:51.519 --> 01:18:53.812
Right, doc? Can't eat just one?

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:02.696
- Stand by.
- Should see him right now.

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.156
Do you know the group Götterdämmerung?

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:10.078
Absolutely. The first connection
that I had with Hans Meyer...

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:12.080
...who founded the group...

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:13.790
was eight years ago at the Sorbonne.

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:17.001
We've been operating in the States
for the past year and a half.

01:19:17.211 --> 01:19:20.255
You could say we harass the boys
who are calling the shots.

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:23.466
- Like the Van der Veers?
- Yes. Like the Van der Veers.

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:26.010
Harass might include assassination?

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.303
Absolutely.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:28.763
Give me a replay on that.

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:38.273
Harass might include assassination?

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.191
Absolutely.

01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:42.444
Notify Warren and the FBI.

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:51.327
Listen, I hate violence, Dew.
But if violence comes...

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:55.373
I'm ready.
I'm a dead shot and a karate expert.

01:19:55.583 --> 01:19:57.041
My whole body's a weapon.

01:20:10.473 --> 01:20:11.890
I'm not even going to ask.

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.976
Ross and the Feds have got a big play.

01:20:15.186 --> 01:20:18.062
- We're invited. You don't need a tie.
- Don't like parties.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:23.067
Okay. You and Whittington stay here
and play with hairs and dead derelicts.

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:24.527
There's a connection.

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:29.616
To Van der Veer? That's a big jump
from the South Bronx to Wall Street.

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:33.119
On Sunday mornings, folks like
to dress up and go downtown to eat.

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:35.205
Do they?
Why didn't they eat Van der Veer?

01:20:35.414 --> 01:20:37.916
- He's got to taste better than a junkie.
- I don't know.

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:40.293
But do you know
how many people disappear daily?

01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:44.130
- Hey! Twenty-eight years.
- Right, you know. Hundreds.

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.050
Nobody gives a shit
until it's somebody who'll be missed.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:49.093
- So?
- So the APB on Ferguson...

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:50.762
is coming up goose eggs.

01:20:51.305 --> 01:20:53.598
- Who?
- Dr. Ferguson.

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:56.935
- Oh.
- Listen, what the fuck have you got?

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:58.770
Nothing...

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.855
yet.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:15.245
- Whit, you take that building over there.
- Yeah.

01:21:15.454 --> 01:21:17.247
- That'll be a good place.
- All right.

01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:19.582
Go to the third floor
and look for the church.

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:22.126
You should see the church
from that side, okay?

01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:24.963
- Yeah, all right.
- Rig up your mike and I'll be in touch.

01:23:37.805 --> 01:23:39.097
Asshole.

01:23:43.477 --> 01:23:45.186
Whit, where are you?

01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:47.271
Check the light.

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.694
Black moon over Manhattan.

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:57.532
Oh.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:02.245
I'll tell you, Dew, I'm starting
to feel a little foolish out here.

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:06.582
Ain't going to bag no game tonight, man.
They're too smart for you, babe.

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:11.671
Probably eating in town tonight.
A little white meat, little stuffing...

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.466
brandy, cigars....

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.552
They're here.

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:19.429
"They're here."

01:24:34.445 --> 01:24:37.447
Hey, where are you going?
What the hell are you doing, man?

01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:39.240
I'll just take a look.

01:25:20.157 --> 01:25:21.324
See you around.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.739
You gonna check the tower?

01:26:27.558 --> 01:26:29.350
So? Anything?

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:21.068
Dew? What's going on?

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:22.653
Fucking birds!

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:49.972
Does that thing have a basement?

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:55.645
Getting a little excited, Dew? Huh?

01:27:57.522 --> 01:27:58.689
Pants getting wet yet?

01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:12.328
Goddamn it, Whittington!

01:29:56.516 --> 01:30:00.394
1-12-83. Apprehension
of terrorist group Götterdämmerung.

01:30:00.604 --> 01:30:02.646
Alleged suspects
of the Van der Veer slaying.

01:30:02.856 --> 01:30:04.148
1200 hours.

01:30:04.358 --> 01:30:06.484
Tactical forces meet
with light resistance.

01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:14.075
Look at that.

01:30:18.205 --> 01:30:19.246
Punch up the arrest.

01:30:22.501 --> 01:30:26.420
Check with the boss. See how much time
we have before releasing this to the news.

01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:02.873
Where did I fail

01:31:05.502 --> 01:31:11.048
Why did you leave me

01:31:14.428 --> 01:31:17.471
Always to sail

01:31:17.681 --> 01:31:20.349
This sea of heartbreak

01:31:20.559 --> 01:31:23.727
Lost love and loneliness

01:31:23.937 --> 01:31:26.439
Mem'ries of your caress

01:31:42.539 --> 01:31:44.707
It's not wolves. It's Wolfen.

01:31:45.292 --> 01:31:49.253
For 20,000 years, Wilson,
10 times your fucking Christian era...

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:54.300
the Skins and the wolves,
great hunting nations, lived together.

01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:57.970
Nature in balance.
Then the slaughter came.

01:32:02.893 --> 01:32:04.268
The smartest ones...

01:32:05.312 --> 01:32:06.812
they went underground.

01:32:08.231 --> 01:32:10.691
Into the new wilderness. Your cities.

01:32:12.152 --> 01:32:16.280
Into the great slum areas,
the graveyard of your fucking species.

01:32:17.949 --> 01:32:21.785
These great hunters
became your scavengers.

01:32:22.537 --> 01:32:26.499
Your garbage, your abandoned people
became their new meat animal.

01:32:28.084 --> 01:32:32.379
- But they're only....
- Animals? Are you sure, Wilson?

01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:34.173
They might be gods.

01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:37.051
In their eyes...

01:32:38.136 --> 01:32:39.595
you are the savage.

01:32:40.514 --> 01:32:42.806
You got your technology, but you lost.

01:32:44.434 --> 01:32:45.935
You lost your senses.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:11.085
They can see two looks away.
They can hear a cloud pass overhead.

01:33:11.545 --> 01:33:14.505
In their world,
there can be no lies, no crime.

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:16.131
No need for detectives.

01:33:16.341 --> 01:33:20.010
- They are brothers.
- No! They are other nations.

01:33:22.973 --> 01:33:24.431
Their world is older.

01:33:25.308 --> 01:33:28.435
More finished, more complete.

01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:35.526
- They kill.
- The sick, the abandoned.

01:33:36.695 --> 01:33:39.738
- Those who will not be missed.
- More than that.

01:33:40.156 --> 01:33:43.242
They kill to survive.
They kill to protect.

01:33:45.287 --> 01:33:47.913
- Family?
- Man kills for less.

01:33:48.748 --> 01:33:52.001
But in the end,
it is all for hunting ground.

01:33:54.713 --> 01:33:56.380
You've seen them, haven't you?

01:33:59.676 --> 01:34:01.635
You don't have the eyes of the hunter.

01:34:03.013 --> 01:34:04.680
You have the eyes of the dead.

01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:15.190
Shit, man! This is all just Indian jive.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.943
We've been watching
too many cowboy movies.

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:27.411
Don't even think
about believing any of this shit.

01:34:27.621 --> 01:34:29.580
It's the 20th century.

01:34:32.459 --> 01:34:34.084
We've got it all figured out.

01:35:04.157 --> 01:35:05.616
Family.

01:35:27.931 --> 01:35:29.556
Hunting.

01:35:40.235 --> 01:35:41.360
Hunting.

01:35:43.530 --> 01:35:44.863
Hunting.

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:08.512
Territory.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.639
Territory.

01:36:12.434 --> 01:36:14.101
Terrorism.

01:36:17.814 --> 01:36:19.356
Terror.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.542
Ground breaking.

01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:50.095
Groundbreaking ceremony.

01:37:22.295 --> 01:37:25.506
In the largest urban renewal
project since the early '70s...

01:37:25.715 --> 01:37:29.218
construction on Van der Veer Tower,
the luxury condominium complex...

01:37:29.427 --> 01:37:30.719
started today.

01:37:31.012 --> 01:37:33.764
It marks the beginning
of the rebirth of this city.

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:35.974
Ground.

01:37:37.519 --> 01:37:41.063
They kill to protect
their hunting ground.

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:42.648
...South Bronx with a silver shovel...

01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:45.692
surrounded by notable personalities
of the tri-state area.

01:37:45.902 --> 01:37:48.237
Twenty-eight acres of deserted rubble
will be....

01:37:48.446 --> 01:37:52.616
Mr. Van der Veer's real estate project.
Groundbreaking ceremony was Saturday.

01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:56.453
Ed Robinson, Channel 8 News,
speaking from the South Bronx.

01:37:57.497 --> 01:37:59.122
Hunting ground.

01:38:05.797 --> 01:38:08.715
Sorry, Dewey, I couldn't resist.
There's your wolf.

01:38:08.925 --> 01:38:10.425
Dewey!

01:38:11.052 --> 01:38:13.262
- What's this?
- It's your wolf hair.

01:38:13.513 --> 01:38:16.139
We found it when
the Götterdämmerung group was captured.

01:38:16.349 --> 01:38:19.560
Their terrorist motto,
"The end of the world by wolves."

01:38:20.144 --> 01:38:22.271
We had an informer.
We'll get a confession.

01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:25.190
Come on, Dewey, let's get out of here.

01:38:37.537 --> 01:38:39.162
Dewey, what happened?

01:39:19.078 --> 01:39:21.038
Come on, Dewey. Car's over here.

01:40:03.122 --> 01:40:05.540
I'll be god-fucking-damned!

01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:56.216
Don't do it!

01:40:59.429 --> 01:41:01.013
Don't even think.

01:41:19.157 --> 01:41:20.824
Stop!

01:41:45.391 --> 01:41:47.559
348 Stock Exchange.

01:42:46.327 --> 01:42:47.285
Shit!

01:44:15.708 --> 01:44:18.210
Are you sure, Wilson?
They might be gods.

01:44:18.419 --> 01:44:22.547
Their senses transport them
inside of your mind.

01:44:22.757 --> 01:44:24.841
The smartest ones,
they went underground.

01:44:25.051 --> 01:44:27.677
Their world is older, more finished.

01:44:28.587 --> 01:44:32.347
- More complete.
- Hunter and prey. Nature in balance.

01:44:32.447 --> 01:44:35.027
In their world, there can be no lies...

01:44:35.762 --> 01:44:38.313
- ...no crimes.
- No need for detectives.

01:44:38.522 --> 01:44:42.275
In their eyes, you are the savage.

01:44:46.572 --> 01:44:47.656
Dewey.

01:45:04.548 --> 01:45:05.882
Dewey.

01:45:15.685 --> 01:45:16.810
Dewey!

01:46:48.778 --> 01:46:50.570
Eight, seven...

01:46:50.821 --> 01:46:52.447
six, five...

01:46:53.032 --> 01:46:54.407
four...

01:46:54.617 --> 01:46:56.284
three, two...

01:46:56.494 --> 01:46:57.619
one!

01:47:33.864 --> 01:47:35.532
No shooting!

01:47:36.325 --> 01:47:38.076
No!

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:39.577
No!

01:47:41.705 --> 01:47:42.956
No...!

01:48:11.694 --> 01:48:13.736
What the hell happened up here?

01:48:14.905 --> 01:48:16.072
Terrorists.

01:48:17.074 --> 01:48:18.366
Götterdämmerung?

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:20.243
Yeah.

01:48:21.162 --> 01:48:22.579
Götterdämmerung.

01:48:41.182 --> 01:48:44.309
In arrogance, man knows
nothing of what exists.

01:48:45.144 --> 01:48:48.229
There exists on earth,
such as we dare not imagine.

01:48:48.814 --> 01:48:51.107
Life as certain as our death.

01:48:51.692 --> 01:48:55.445
Life that will prey on us
as we prey on this earth.
