WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:05.875
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:05.918 --> 00:07.311
sexually based offenses

00:07.355 --> 00:09.400
are considered
especially heinous.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.750
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:11.794 --> 00:13.883
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:13.926 --> 00:15.276
are members of an elite squad

00:15.319 --> 00:17.234
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:17.278 --> 00:20.063
These are their stories.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.694
- Yeah, so--

01:14.726 --> 01:18.252
- And that's all
you want to tell me?

01:20.602 --> 01:24.171
Okay.

01:24.214 --> 01:26.651
Then we are done here.

01:50.849 --> 01:53.852
- Hello, Annabeth.

01:57.813 --> 02:01.251
My name is Olivia Benson.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.390
- This is a very simple case.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.393
The defendant, Annabeth Pearl,

02:12.436 --> 02:14.438
hosted a dinner party
with her husband, Thomas,

02:14.482 --> 02:16.614
at their apartment
on West 26th street.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.660
Three people ate
New York strip,

02:18.703 --> 02:21.402
baked potatoes,
and creamed spinach.

02:21.445 --> 02:22.925
Three hours later,
when the guests had left

02:22.968 --> 02:25.449
and the dishes were loaded
into the dishwasher,

02:25.493 --> 02:28.452
Annabeth put on her nightie...

02:28.496 --> 02:30.672
walked into the den...

02:30.715 --> 02:32.804
picked up the gun that was
sitting on the coffee table,

02:32.848 --> 02:35.981
and shot her husband, Thomas,
three times

02:36.025 --> 02:39.246
while he was watching TV.

02:39.289 --> 02:40.986
The detectives
assigned to this case

02:41.030 --> 02:42.640
will tell you how
they arrested Annabeth

02:42.684 --> 02:44.468
less than an hour later
at a local eatery

02:44.512 --> 02:47.819
with the murder weapon
still in her possession.

02:47.863 --> 02:50.431
They'll tell you how,
without provocation,

02:50.474 --> 02:53.390
she confessed to the murder.

02:53.434 --> 02:56.959
Now, the defense will play
on your emotions.

02:57.002 --> 02:59.309
They'll tell you about
a bad marriage,

02:59.353 --> 03:01.268
an abused wife.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.486
But what they can't tell you

03:02.530 --> 03:04.488
is that Thomas
ever hit Annabeth

03:04.532 --> 03:06.229
or that she was ever
in imminent fear

03:06.273 --> 03:08.275
of physical harm.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.974
This is a very simple case.

03:12.888 --> 03:16.761
Annabeth Pearl is guilty
of murder in the second degree.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.517
- How's it going?
- Ah, great.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.911
Oof.
- Oh, Jesus.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.566
- Hey, I wouldn't drink that

03:38.609 --> 03:40.481
unless your tongue
is made of asbestos.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.047
- You--you could have
told me that

03:42.091 --> 03:43.832
before I burned my fingers.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.877
- Sorry.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.401
- Rollins, SVU.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.185
- Yeah.
Bucci, 2-8.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.317
Whatcha got?

03:50.360 --> 03:53.276
- Uh, husband and wife thing.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.670
- Yeah.
Robbery at a bodega.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.585
Teenage girl ripped off
a case of tampons

03:57.628 --> 03:59.239
while her boyfriend
emptied the register.

03:59.282 --> 04:02.285
- Hmm.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.247
I hate this.
Waiting.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.509
- Not me.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.902
I get to sit here,
read the paper.

04:10.946 --> 04:14.079
Nobody's calling me an SOB,
nobody's shooting at me.

04:14.123 --> 04:15.907
Life could be worse.

04:15.951 --> 04:18.258
- Detective Bucci.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.520
- Yeah?
You're on.

04:19.563 --> 04:22.523
Part 21.
- All right.

04:33.621 --> 04:36.101
- You alone?
- Yep.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.320
What you got?

04:37.364 --> 04:39.540
- All right.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.324
Anything but the jellies.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.500
- Ooh, thank you.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.459
- No sign of Liv?

04:45.502 --> 04:47.287
- No, I was hoping
you heard something.

04:48.636 --> 04:51.639
Scruples are a hard thing
to live with.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.336
- What if she doesn't show?

04:53.380 --> 04:56.600
- Then she doesn't show.

04:56.644 --> 05:00.387
- Her testimony will be
the nails in Annabeth's coffin.

05:00.430 --> 05:03.346
Without it, Stone--

05:03.390 --> 05:05.653
- Oh.

05:05.696 --> 05:08.612
- Will be hot
as that cup of coffee.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.962
- What Mr. Stone
didn't tell you

05:11.006 --> 05:15.010
was that Thomas took one bite
of his New York strip,

05:15.053 --> 05:16.446
spit it out,

05:16.490 --> 05:18.013
and then told Annabeth
he was going

05:18.056 --> 05:21.103
to give the rest
to the neighbor's beagle.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.931
What Mr. Stone didn't tell you

05:22.974 --> 05:26.630
was that that dinner
was the culmination

05:26.674 --> 05:30.155
of six years of continuous
psychological abuse.

05:30.199 --> 05:33.420
The straw that crippled
the camel, if you will.

05:33.463 --> 05:36.074
Criticism, insults, blame--

05:36.118 --> 05:38.338
all of which served

05:38.381 --> 05:40.644
to diminish Annabeth's dignity,

05:40.688 --> 05:42.820
destroy her self-worth,

05:42.864 --> 05:45.649
and erase her self-confidence.

05:45.693 --> 05:48.043
Now, Mr. Stone may call

05:48.086 --> 05:50.480
what Annabeth did "murder,"

05:50.524 --> 05:53.657
But I call it
self-preservation.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.749
I'm sure you will, too.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.277
- This room
gives me the willies.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.627
- The belly of the beast.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.193
- Yeah, well,
my belly feels like

06:08.237 --> 06:09.934
the professor's about
to hand out the final exam.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.849
- It's Annabeth that should
be nervous, not you.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.416
- This is wrong.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.419
- Don't go all Liv
on us, all right?

06:16.463 --> 06:17.681
The woman shot her husband

06:17.725 --> 06:19.117
because he didn't like
her dinner.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.597
- Life should be so easy.

06:20.641 --> 06:23.034
- Come on, not you, too.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.384
- I don't judge.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.515
Is it hot in here?

06:25.559 --> 06:27.256
- Hell always is.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.692
- Yeah, he is.

06:28.736 --> 06:31.434
He's going full Liv.
- Somebody has to.

06:31.478 --> 06:32.870
- Yeah, that's right.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.306
And that "somebody"
interrogated Annabeth.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.525
I wonder who that could be?

06:35.569 --> 06:36.918
- What if she doesn't show?

06:36.961 --> 06:38.876
- Look, man,
we can only do our job.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.878
- What, that's all
this is to you?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.140
- Yeah.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.751
I get up in the morning
and I get dressed.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.492
I come to the office.
After that, I go home.

06:45.535 --> 06:48.016
At the end of the week, I get
a check and the check clears.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.713
That's called a job.
- Okay, you know what?

06:49.757 --> 06:51.411
It's not all on us,
though, Carisi.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.890
We do our part,

06:52.934 --> 06:54.762
but the rest is up
to a judge and jury.

06:54.805 --> 06:55.980
- All right,
so what happens upstairs,

06:56.024 --> 06:57.895
that doesn't concern you
at all?

06:57.939 --> 06:59.810
- The short and sweet
is fine with me.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.246
- Oh, please, give me a break.

07:01.290 --> 07:02.813
This from the guy
who flew to Cuba

07:02.857 --> 07:05.642
on his own nickel
to catch a fugitive rapist.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.035
And you,
with that Labott girl--

07:07.078 --> 07:10.081
- Enough.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.301
- Carisi, have a donut.

07:12.344 --> 07:13.563
- Are you telling me

07:13.607 --> 07:14.912
that you never even
think about this?

07:14.956 --> 07:16.610
I mean, the--
the responsibility?

07:16.653 --> 07:19.221
The--the power that we have?

07:19.264 --> 07:21.179
I mean, I could get up
on that stand and I could lie.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.964
I could say,
"Yeah, Annabeth told me

07:23.007 --> 07:24.748
she planned on killing Thomas
for the past six months."

07:24.792 --> 07:26.576
Now, I do that, she is done.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.840
No question.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.538
Or I could say I don't recall.

07:31.581 --> 07:34.062
"I don't recall"
to anything that Stone asks me.

07:34.105 --> 07:37.587
And maybe she gets to live
a nice, peaceful, safe life

07:37.631 --> 07:38.588
in a Chelsea apartment.

07:38.632 --> 07:41.417
- Or door number three...

07:41.461 --> 07:42.505
you tell the truth.

07:42.549 --> 07:45.377
- All I'm saying is...

07:45.421 --> 07:48.206
It's a lot of power.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.472
And who the hell are we?

07:52.515 --> 07:53.734
- Detective Tutuola.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.518
- Yo.
- Part 33.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.564
- Carisi, chill out.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.609
Have some donuts.

08:04.614 --> 08:05.833
Jerry Griffin.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.791
He's the bartender
at the Tatum.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.663
He met me outside in the front.

08:09.706 --> 08:12.970
He told me Annabeth Pearl
was inside with a gun.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.711
- Mr. Griffin
knew her personally?

08:14.755 --> 08:17.322
- Ms. Pearl and her husband
lived across the street.

08:17.366 --> 08:18.585
It was their local joint.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.369
- What, if anything,
did you do then?

08:20.412 --> 08:21.544
- I went inside.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.068
I saw Ms. Pearl sitting alone

08:24.112 --> 08:25.809
covered in blood

08:25.853 --> 08:28.899
with the gun sitting
in front of her on the table.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.727
- Was there anything else
on the table?

08:30.771 --> 08:34.252
- Yeah, what looked like
a wedding ring.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.732
- Huh.

08:35.776 --> 08:38.648
Thank you, Sergeant.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.999
- I knew Tommy, you know?

08:42.043 --> 08:44.045
- Who?
- Thomas Pearl.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.350
The deceased.

08:45.394 --> 08:46.961
I knew him in the Academy.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.615
Once a prick, always a prick.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.355
- That explains a lot.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.749
- And the son of a bitch
was in this world for himself.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.838
- Not anymore, he's not.

08:54.882 --> 08:57.537
- This guy, he--he never
picked up a tab in his life.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.016
He never paid off his bets.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.888
He was this--
this macho piece of crap

09:00.931 --> 09:02.106
who was always bragging about

09:02.150 --> 09:04.761
how he cheated
on his girlfriend.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.850
Thought a woman's place
was behind a desk.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.591
- Yeah, him and how many
other cops?

09:08.635 --> 09:09.679
- Come on,
it's not like that anymore.

09:09.723 --> 09:10.680
- Oh, yeah?
It's not?

09:10.724 --> 09:12.552
Good to know.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.118
- Wait, somebody's been
screwing with you?

09:14.162 --> 09:15.859
- Oh, forget it, Carisi.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.469
Look, the guy
may have been a dick,

09:17.513 --> 09:19.036
but if he's gonna
take a bullet it deserves to be

09:19.080 --> 09:20.908
from some--
some yahoo hocking heroin

09:20.951 --> 09:22.562
or robbing a bank
or something.

09:22.605 --> 09:23.998
Not from his wife.
- Why?

09:24.041 --> 09:26.348
Because she promised to honor,
cherish, and obey him?

09:26.391 --> 09:29.003
- Because he's a cop.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.572
Hey.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.486
Just--come on, loosen up.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.446
- All right, all right.
- Right?

09:37.489 --> 09:40.797
- Where the hell is Lieu?

09:40.841 --> 09:42.364
- You should be happy.

09:42.407 --> 09:45.846
If she doesn't show up,
Annabeth will probably walk.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.269
- Hey, Lieu.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.097
I, uh, wasn't sure
you were gonna show up.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.142
- Well, neither was I.
- Yeah.

11:05.186 --> 11:07.667
So, uh, listen, on--
on this one,

11:07.710 --> 11:09.451
there's--there's ways
that you can

11:09.494 --> 11:10.800
maybe color your testimony.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.323
I mean, not out and out lie,

11:12.367 --> 11:14.891
but just maybe you emphasize
certain parts.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.719
What--what Annabeth told you.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.329
Other parts, not so much.

11:18.373 --> 11:19.853
- Really, Carisi?

11:19.896 --> 11:22.072
- Well, you're the one
that interrogated Annabeth,

11:22.116 --> 11:23.552
so people are gonna be
pretty interested

11:23.595 --> 11:24.814
in what you have to say.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.816
- Well, if I say.
- Lieu, I'm sorry.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.383
I'm not feeling okay
about this case, okay?

11:28.426 --> 11:30.428
Maybe I feel like SOBs
like Tommy Pearl

11:30.472 --> 11:31.995
get exactly what they deserve.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.301
- When a cop gets killed,
it's an itch I can't scratch.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.129
- He's a cop
who abused his wife!

11:35.172 --> 11:36.826
- With his words.
Annabeth didn't have to listen.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.829
- Look, guys, stop.
Stop.

11:42.179 --> 11:45.748
And law without empathy...

11:45.792 --> 11:48.272
doesn't help anyone, Rollins.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.710
- I...

11:50.753 --> 11:52.886
I'm all about empathy.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.802
Come on, it's--
it's coming out of my ears.

11:55.845 --> 11:57.673
For eight years
I'm drowning in it.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.328
- What about Tommy's gun, huh?
He just puts it on the table--

12:00.371 --> 12:02.286
- Yeah, he left it out.
Did he ever point it at her?

12:02.330 --> 12:03.548
- Amanda.
- Did he threaten her?

12:03.592 --> 12:04.898
This is not freshman English.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.551
We don't have to read
between the lines.

12:06.595 --> 12:09.032
It's not our job.
- Maybe it is.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.817
Maybe we shouldn't
ignore the fact

12:10.860 --> 12:12.993
that Annabeth was a victim.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.559
- Well, that kind of
doesn't work

12:14.603 --> 12:17.824
because it's her husband
who's the one in the casket.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.392
He was a cop.

12:21.436 --> 12:24.744
Liv, he wore the same shield
as we do.

12:25.657 --> 12:29.444
- My lieutenant was convinced
there was domestic abuse.

12:29.487 --> 12:32.360
- Was there?

12:32.403 --> 12:34.014
- Well, her husband
never hit her,

12:34.057 --> 12:35.929
if that's what you mean.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.322
- Is that the only kind
of abuse contemplated

12:38.366 --> 12:39.584
by the statute?

12:39.628 --> 12:42.500
- Objection, the witness
is not an attorney.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.981
- Withdrawn.

12:45.025 --> 12:48.506
How many times
was Mr. Pearl shot, Sergeant?

12:48.550 --> 12:49.594
- Three.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.509
- And where were the wounds?

12:51.553 --> 12:55.426
- Two in the chest
and one in the crotch.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.997
- Interesting.

13:03.347 --> 13:05.959
Nothing further.

13:06.002 --> 13:08.483
- Redirect.

13:10.485 --> 13:13.444
Sergeant, did the defendant,
Annabeth Pearl,

13:13.488 --> 13:17.013
ever claim that she was raped
by her husband?

13:17.057 --> 13:18.885
- Not that I'm aware of.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.409
- Thank you.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.243
- Listen, my man, is--is there
anything you can do

13:29.286 --> 13:30.635
about this heat?

13:30.679 --> 13:32.159
- I'll tell Wally,
but I doubt it's gonna change.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.725
One thermostat
for the whole floor.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.162
Judge Finkel likes it this way.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.598
- Well, why don't you see
what you can do, okay?

13:36.641 --> 13:37.991
Thank you.
- Sure will.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.731
Well...

13:39.775 --> 13:42.473
You guys have a nice day.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.824
- You, too.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.136
- Sometimes I wish I had a job
like that guy.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.965
- Oh, so you could listen
to cops bitch all day long?

13:56.009 --> 13:57.880
- Something without
consequence.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.926
- Think what you mean to say
is that you wish

13:59.969 --> 14:02.842
that you weren't cursed
with a conscience.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.495
- Well, it's definitely
a burden.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.977
- It also makes us human.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.849
- Unless you're a sociopath.
- Oh, come on.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.460
You--you actually think
that Annabeth is a sociopath?

14:12.503 --> 14:14.157
- I think she knew
what she was doing,

14:14.201 --> 14:15.419
and I think she didn't care.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.900
- Or she didn't see
another way out.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.336
- Yeah, there we go.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.860
- Well, luckily we don't have
to read her mind.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.339
- But we do, Rollins.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.037
Eighty grand a year
and we get to determine

14:24.080 --> 14:25.429
who's spending the rest
of their life in a cage

14:25.473 --> 14:27.170
and who's gonna eat dinner
at Del Frisco's.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.825
- Worrying about it
is way above our pay grade.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.393
- We do worry about it.

14:32.436 --> 14:33.960
At least--
at least we usually do.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.309
- Yeah?
You never wanted to put

14:35.352 --> 14:38.312
a couple of pops
between some guy's eyes?

14:39.443 --> 14:40.923
I mean...

14:40.967 --> 14:42.794
you know,
'cause I've wanted to, and I--

14:42.838 --> 14:44.448
I would have really enjoyed it.

14:44.492 --> 14:45.580
But I didn't.

14:45.623 --> 14:47.277
- Because you knew
that it was wrong.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.018
- Because I knew
the consequences

14:49.062 --> 14:50.411
and I chose not to.

14:50.454 --> 14:51.760
- And maybe she didn't have
that luxury.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.370
- Annabeth chose it.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.764
She chose to end
that man's life.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.679
She chose to take
someone's life.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.855
To break the law.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.205
It's free will.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.685
I mean, come on,
we all learn about it

15:03.728 --> 15:05.208
in Sunday school.

15:05.252 --> 15:06.862
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're--we're free, all right.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.516
We're free to believe
in the guy upstairs or not.

15:08.559 --> 15:09.734
It's like a perjury trap.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.085
- Okay, all we have to do

15:12.128 --> 15:15.131
is go up on the stand
and say what happened!

15:15.175 --> 15:16.350
There's no choices!

15:16.393 --> 15:18.439
There's no consequences to you!

15:18.482 --> 15:21.050
- They put a crown
of thorns on Jesus,

15:21.094 --> 15:22.747
but that did not make him king.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.141
- What is he
talking about?

15:25.185 --> 15:26.621
- And neither does our shield.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.971
- But what we say
in that courtroom, Lieutenant,

15:29.015 --> 15:32.235
how we say it, this--this game
could be over before it starts.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.063
- You know what, if you want
to commit perjury

15:34.107 --> 15:36.065
because Tommy hurt
Annabeth's feelings--

15:36.109 --> 15:37.240
- Damn it, Rollins,
it is more complicated

15:37.284 --> 15:38.676
than that and you know it.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.156
- Okay.
- "Perjury."

15:40.200 --> 15:41.549
I'm talking about
the truth here,

15:41.592 --> 15:43.072
and I'm gonna make sure
the jury sees it.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.595
- Yeah?

15:44.639 --> 15:45.945
And Liv's testimony is gonna
turn them the other way.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.251
- If...

15:48.295 --> 15:51.776
I tell them exactly,
verbatim...

15:51.820 --> 15:53.430
what Annabeth told me.

15:53.474 --> 15:54.823
- Lieutenant...

15:54.866 --> 15:56.564
I know the law better
than anybody in this room,

15:56.607 --> 16:00.437
but I also know
my moral responsibility.

16:00.481 --> 16:04.050
Killing Tommy
was Annabeth's only option.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.313
Now, the law says
that that's wrong.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.271
But morally...
- You're not a priest, Carisi.

16:08.315 --> 16:11.187
- Morally, the result is just.

16:11.231 --> 16:14.277
- You know what, I've got
one question for you:

16:14.321 --> 16:16.018
Why didn't she walk
out the door?

16:16.062 --> 16:17.715
Why didn't she leave
the damn bastard?

16:17.759 --> 16:19.456
- Are you kidding me, Amanda?
- No!

16:19.500 --> 16:22.416
For it to be
a justifiable homicide,

16:22.459 --> 16:24.548
there had to be
an imminent threat

16:24.592 --> 16:28.117
of death or--or serious
physical harm, right?

16:28.161 --> 16:30.119
And was Tommy about
to beat Annabeth?

16:30.163 --> 16:32.382
No.
Was he about to rape her?

16:32.426 --> 16:33.818
No!

16:33.862 --> 16:35.124
You know how I know that?

16:35.168 --> 16:38.736
Because that's what
she told you.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.526
- When I was in the bag,

16:45.569 --> 16:48.616
I took
a domestic disturbance call.

16:48.659 --> 16:49.878
All right?

16:49.921 --> 16:51.575
Craig and Ellen Carter.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.403
Their neighbor was complaining
because they were screaming

16:53.447 --> 16:55.144
at each other all night.
They were cursing.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.016
So I show up.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.408
I calm everybody down

16:58.452 --> 17:00.149
and do, you know,
what we're supposed to do.

17:00.193 --> 17:03.848
And I'm looking at this guy
and I can just see in his eyes.

17:03.892 --> 17:06.764
And he's got that smirk,
you know?

17:06.808 --> 17:10.420
So I take Ellen outside,
and I say, "Listen.

17:10.464 --> 17:13.684
Listen, you've gotta
stand up for yourself."

17:15.164 --> 17:18.733
I told her that she needed
to leave this guy.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.388
But there's no signs
of physical violence

17:21.431 --> 17:23.042
so that's--that's all I can do.

17:23.085 --> 17:26.132
A month later...

17:26.175 --> 17:28.047
I get another call.

17:28.090 --> 17:31.615
The same house,
same complaint.

17:31.659 --> 17:33.530
Only this time...

17:33.574 --> 17:35.141
Craig is taking her head
and bashing it

17:35.184 --> 17:36.490
against the wall,
and she's dead.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.231
So don't you
stand there and say

17:38.274 --> 17:41.669
that all she had to do
was walk out the damn door!

17:41.712 --> 17:43.149
- Detective Carisi.

17:43.192 --> 17:45.064
- That's me.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.588
- Part 33.

18:02.690 --> 18:05.127
- Mr. Griffin, the bartender
at the restaurant,

18:05.171 --> 18:06.781
told me that Annabeth lived
across the street.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.348
So based on the way
that she was dressed,

18:08.391 --> 18:09.523
I assumed that she'd just
come from home.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.177
So I went over there.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.961
- And what did you do once
you arrived at her apartment?

18:13.004 --> 18:14.789
- I rang the bell, I knocked.
There was no answer.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.530
So I tried the door,
which was unlocked.

18:16.573 --> 18:19.489
I went inside.
- Were there signs of a fight?

18:19.533 --> 18:22.362
- Well, it's impossible
to tell.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.407
- Excuse me?

18:24.451 --> 18:26.801
- It's impossible to tell.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.672
The defendant could have
easily straightened up

18:28.716 --> 18:30.021
before she left the apartment,

18:30.065 --> 18:31.545
or even before
she shot her husband.

18:31.588 --> 18:32.894
- That's not what I asked,
Detective.

18:32.937 --> 18:36.158
Uh, once you were
inside the apartment,

18:36.202 --> 18:38.595
were there signs of a fight?

18:40.858 --> 18:42.947
- No.

18:42.991 --> 18:45.167
- Okay.

18:47.300 --> 18:51.130
- You know, Liv, I love you...

18:51.173 --> 18:52.261
Okay?

18:52.305 --> 18:55.482
And I respect you...

18:55.525 --> 18:58.528
more than anyone
I've ever met in my life.

18:58.572 --> 19:01.488
Don't take this
the wrong way...

19:01.531 --> 19:04.317
but sometimes...

19:04.360 --> 19:06.232
you see victims

19:06.275 --> 19:08.799
where there aren't any.

19:08.843 --> 19:12.325
- Annabeth Pearl
was abused by her husband.

19:12.368 --> 19:13.543
- Her friends disagree.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.676
- Nobody knows what goes on

19:15.719 --> 19:17.156
behind closed doors
in a marriage.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.244
- Including you.

19:18.287 --> 19:21.072
All you have
is Annabeth's word.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.513
- Amanda, I'm sorry about
what your father did

19:26.556 --> 19:29.124
to your mother.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.518
- See?

19:31.561 --> 19:33.302
I mean, that's exactly

19:33.346 --> 19:35.652
what I'm talking about.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.872
My mother didn't have
to be a victim.

19:37.915 --> 19:41.049
- I'm not talking
about your mother.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.443
I'm talking about you.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.967
Do you really think
that your father

19:46.010 --> 19:48.143
beating the hell
out of your mother

19:48.187 --> 19:51.015
in front of you...

19:51.059 --> 19:53.757
didn't...

19:53.801 --> 19:57.413
color your whole universe?

19:58.849 --> 20:00.851
- Sure it did.

20:00.895 --> 20:03.027
But not in the way you think.

20:03.071 --> 20:06.248
'Cause I remember
sitting in my room

20:06.292 --> 20:08.555
staring out the window...

20:08.598 --> 20:11.993
after one of their
knock-down drag-outs,

20:12.036 --> 20:13.473
and I remember looking
out the window

20:13.516 --> 20:15.736
and there was a--a streetlamp,
and it was--

20:15.779 --> 20:17.216
the closest one
was on the corner,

20:17.259 --> 20:18.652
so it was--it was dark, eerie.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.567
And I sat there...

20:20.610 --> 20:23.918
looking out,
watching and waiting...

20:23.961 --> 20:26.573
and praying for my daddy
to come back.

20:26.616 --> 20:27.791
Uh, and the son of a bitch

20:27.835 --> 20:30.403
just beat the snot
out of my mother,

20:30.446 --> 20:32.187
but I wanted him back home.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.710
- Of course you did,

20:33.754 --> 20:37.105
'cause all children
want their parents together

20:37.148 --> 20:38.541
no matter what, Amanda.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.413
Good, bad, indifferent--

20:40.456 --> 20:41.936
- She could have called
the sheriff.

20:41.979 --> 20:44.373
I mean, Christ, we had
a gun locker in the house.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.636
But she had to be a martyr.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.072
I mean, I don't think
she'd know what to do

20:48.116 --> 20:50.466
with herself if she wasn't
suffering or cowering.

20:50.510 --> 20:53.034
- Yes, because
he made her like that.

20:53.077 --> 20:55.819
- You don't know!

20:55.863 --> 20:59.127
There was a weakness in her!

20:59.170 --> 21:00.433
There was a weakness,

21:00.476 --> 21:02.609
and it was there
before they ever even met.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.132
- How do you know that?

21:04.175 --> 21:07.309
- Because this is this.

21:07.353 --> 21:10.443
It's not that.

21:10.486 --> 21:13.620
But you know, I--I know.

21:13.663 --> 21:15.012
Believe me, I know,

21:15.056 --> 21:17.319
because I was the one
staring out that window

21:17.363 --> 21:18.886
waiting for my daddy's shadow

21:18.929 --> 21:20.496
to come out
of that street lamp.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.368
Come up the sidewalk,
up the front walk,

21:22.411 --> 21:23.543
and back into our house.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.980
I was the one
that was petrified

21:26.023 --> 21:28.243
that I would end up weak
like my mom

21:28.287 --> 21:30.332
if he didn't come back!

21:30.376 --> 21:33.074
- Amanda, that's not a reason

21:33.117 --> 21:35.990
to hate your mother.

21:45.565 --> 21:48.742
- Maybe it's time...

21:48.785 --> 21:52.615
for you to come out
from under that shadow.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.497
- There was an EMS team
on the scene.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.368
They determined
that she sustained

22:06.412 --> 22:07.717
no physical injuries.

22:07.761 --> 22:09.371
They also said
that she was in shock.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.592
- Did the paramedic indicate
how long she was in shock?

22:12.635 --> 22:14.420
- They didn't say anything
about that,

22:14.463 --> 22:16.291
but it's--it's possible
that she was in shock

22:16.335 --> 22:17.510
before she fired that weapon.

22:17.553 --> 22:19.076
- Before?
- Yeah, it's not unusual--

22:19.120 --> 22:20.382
- Objection.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.123
- It's your witness, Counselor.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.647
Overruled.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.650
- It's not uncommon

22:27.694 --> 22:29.739
for a victim
to go into survival mode

22:29.783 --> 22:31.219
once they've been threatened.

22:31.262 --> 22:34.309
She may not have known
what she was doing.

22:38.879 --> 22:41.795
- One more thing, Detective.

22:41.838 --> 22:45.407
This isn't exactly
what the room looked like

22:45.451 --> 22:47.235
when you went into it, is it?

22:47.278 --> 22:48.410
- Uh, no.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.934
The television was on.

22:50.978 --> 22:53.937
- I'm confused.
The apartment's not that big.

22:53.981 --> 22:56.157
If the TV was on when
you walked in the front door,

22:56.200 --> 22:57.811
I think you would have
heard it.

22:57.854 --> 23:00.161
- Well, the TV was on
but the volume was muted.

23:00.204 --> 23:04.121
- Almost as if
Tommy and Annabeth spoke

23:04.165 --> 23:07.560
before she shot him.

23:07.603 --> 23:08.735
- I wouldn't know about that.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.780
- But they might have, right?

23:10.824 --> 23:14.480
In fact, it is possible
that Tommy said,

23:14.523 --> 23:15.742
"I love you, sweetie."

23:15.785 --> 23:17.613
- Yeah, it's possible.

23:17.657 --> 23:20.442
It's also possible he said,
"You ruined my dinner, bitch.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.574
Now I'm gonna kill you."

23:21.617 --> 23:24.794
- Your Honor!

23:27.710 --> 23:30.365
- Nothing further.

23:30.409 --> 23:34.108
- Well, on that, we're gonna
break for lunch.

23:38.591 --> 23:42.421
- You look like your witness
just committed treason, Peter.

23:50.820 --> 23:52.909
- Liv.

23:52.953 --> 23:54.476
What the hell's
going on down there?

23:54.520 --> 23:55.869
- Excuse me?

23:55.912 --> 23:57.305
- When I walked into
that courtroom this morning,

23:57.348 --> 23:58.306
I had a no-lose case.

23:58.349 --> 23:59.612
Now, two witnesses later,

23:59.655 --> 24:01.091
I am treading water
and gasping for air.

24:01.135 --> 24:03.485
- So Carisi got creative.
- He "got creative"?

24:03.529 --> 24:05.008
He's a cop!

24:05.052 --> 24:06.488
He's supposed
to get on that stand

24:06.532 --> 24:07.576
and tell the truth.

24:07.620 --> 24:08.621
That's it.
- Did he lie?

24:08.664 --> 24:10.318
- Liv, come on.

24:10.361 --> 24:12.581
You and I both know the truth
comes in many colors.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.583
- So maybe Carisi
picked the one

24:14.627 --> 24:17.325
that he could live with.

24:17.368 --> 24:18.979
- I knew it.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.894
I knew you were behind this.

24:20.937 --> 24:23.287
You wanna do me a favor?

24:23.331 --> 24:27.204
You keep your bleeding heart
out of my courtroom.

24:40.261 --> 24:42.916
- So what is your dilemma?
Just do what Carisi said.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.222
Just fudge it.
Generalize, minimize.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.921
- And what if I'm wrong?

24:49.096 --> 24:50.532
- Annabeth told me

24:50.576 --> 24:52.447
that she didn't regret
killing him for a minute.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.970
- Lack of remorse is not
an element of a crime.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.798
- You think a jury
gives a damn?

24:55.842 --> 24:58.105
If I testify truthfully,

24:58.148 --> 25:00.150
then this becomes
a revenge killing

25:00.194 --> 25:01.674
that is never justified.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.284
This woman goes to prison

25:03.327 --> 25:05.765
for a very long time.

25:05.808 --> 25:06.940
- Truth's a bitch.

25:06.983 --> 25:09.551
- I know in my gut...

25:09.595 --> 25:12.032
that she was powerless
to leave her husband.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.555
I know that.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.470
- But she was strong enough
to pull the trigger.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.473
- That's naive, Amanda,
and you know it.

25:20.910 --> 25:23.565
What about the gun?

25:23.609 --> 25:25.524
- What about it?

25:25.567 --> 25:28.962
- Well, he didn't leave it out
just for show.

25:29.005 --> 25:32.487
- Okay, did Annabeth ever say
that he threatened her with it?

25:32.531 --> 25:35.621
- No, she didn't have to
because he left it out.

25:35.664 --> 25:36.970
She saw it.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.537
She saw it when she woke up
in the morning.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.451
She saw it when
she made dinner.

25:40.495 --> 25:41.714
She saw it.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.193
She saw it last thing
before she went to bed.

25:43.237 --> 25:44.630
- And she read
between the lines.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.590
Amanda.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.592
Come on.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.333
You and I both know

25:52.376 --> 25:55.162
what he was telling her
with that gun.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.598
He was telling her

25:56.642 --> 25:58.600
that I could kill you
at any minute,

25:58.644 --> 26:00.515
and I would probably
get away with it.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.908
- Tommy is the one
that ended up

26:01.951 --> 26:03.083
with the bullets
in him, though.

26:03.126 --> 26:05.607
- And where was he shot?

26:05.651 --> 26:09.089
Two in the heart
and one in the groin.

26:09.132 --> 26:10.264
And believe you me,

26:10.307 --> 26:11.744
that last one
was not a mistake.

26:11.787 --> 26:13.659
That was not a miss.
- Did she say that to you?

26:13.702 --> 26:16.313
- She didn't have to.

26:20.753 --> 26:23.320
You have no idea...

26:23.364 --> 26:26.323
what utter terror is.

26:28.108 --> 26:30.632
What pure...

26:30.676 --> 26:33.766
and utter terror is.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.650
You know, they say
that your heart beats faster,

26:48.694 --> 26:49.651
but that's not true.

26:49.695 --> 26:50.565
It doesn't.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.263
It stops.
Everything stops.

26:53.307 --> 26:57.050
You don't breathe because...

26:57.093 --> 27:01.141
you're scared
that it might upset him.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.491
And if you get a cramp
in your foot,

27:03.534 --> 27:07.103
you tell yourself,
"Just let it throb."

27:07.147 --> 27:10.672
Because you'll live
through that pain.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.674
And that's a hell
of a lot better than what--

27:12.718 --> 27:15.546
what he'll do to you.

27:18.941 --> 27:21.509
And the pain is--is so complete

27:21.552 --> 27:25.121
and it's so--
it's so overwhelming.

27:27.297 --> 27:30.518
You can go without food for...

27:31.824 --> 27:34.435
For three days...

27:34.478 --> 27:38.352
and you don't close your eyes
because you--

27:38.395 --> 27:41.224
because you're scared that...

27:41.268 --> 27:44.314
you'll never open them again.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.798
You pray.

27:49.842 --> 27:52.061
You pray...

27:52.105 --> 27:54.629
"Please, God...

27:54.673 --> 27:56.457
"don't let him

27:56.500 --> 27:59.721
climb on top of me again."

28:01.201 --> 28:03.682
- Okay, Liv.

28:04.857 --> 28:07.468
I am so sorry.

28:09.078 --> 28:12.212
- Nobody should have
to live like that.

28:12.255 --> 28:14.823
Nobody.

28:18.566 --> 28:22.309
- Tommy Pearl is not
William Lewis.

28:22.352 --> 28:25.791
Annabeth was not held hostage.

28:25.834 --> 28:28.489
- Wasn't she?

28:30.360 --> 28:32.275
She lived with that fear

28:32.319 --> 28:35.844
every day for six years.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.807
But maybe we're all victims.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.331
Maybe...

28:44.374 --> 28:46.246
maybe we're--

28:46.289 --> 28:49.858
we're just all victims
of our past.

28:51.555 --> 28:55.168
But the good news
is that I am just

28:55.211 --> 28:56.473
a rebuttal witness,

28:56.517 --> 29:00.303
which means I'm only used
if needed.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.436
- What are you gonna do
if Stone needs you?

29:02.479 --> 29:04.351
- I don't know.

29:04.394 --> 29:07.354
But somebody has to stand up
for Annabeth,

29:07.397 --> 29:08.572
and somebody has to tell her--

29:08.616 --> 29:10.357
has to tell her
that she survived

29:10.400 --> 29:12.011
and she's gonna be okay.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.014
- Detective Rollins.

29:15.057 --> 29:17.146
Part 33.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.453
- I haven't finished
my apple pie yet.

29:19.496 --> 29:21.890
- I don't know.
They just told me--

29:21.934 --> 29:24.284
- I'm pulling your leg, guy.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.290
Go.

29:33.423 --> 29:37.166
- You don't want those
to, uh, go to waste.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.081
The donuts.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.387
- Oh, I'm sorry.

29:40.430 --> 29:41.736
Yes, of course.
Please.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.955
- Charlie.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.609
I've had a sweet tooth
since I was a kid.

29:45.653 --> 29:48.787
You mind if I, uh, take home
a cruller to my wife?

29:48.830 --> 29:50.876
She loves crullers.

29:50.919 --> 29:52.573
How long you been married?

29:52.616 --> 29:55.576
- 34 years next Tuesday.

29:55.619 --> 29:57.404
- You're a good husband,
Charlie.

29:57.447 --> 29:59.058
- Ah, it's easy.

29:59.101 --> 30:02.409
All it takes is a little love.

30:09.242 --> 30:11.418
- I took the defendant's
initial statement

30:11.461 --> 30:12.506
when she came in to the squad.

30:12.549 --> 30:13.855
- And what did she say to you?

30:13.899 --> 30:15.117
- She said she'd killed
her husband.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.597
- What did you do after that?

30:16.640 --> 30:18.468
- I asked her if she wanted
a lawyer present,

30:18.512 --> 30:20.731
and she said, "I did it.

30:20.775 --> 30:23.604
Why would I need a lawyer?"

30:26.128 --> 30:27.434
- Did she tell you why

30:27.477 --> 30:30.480
she killed her husband
of six years?

30:30.524 --> 30:31.830
- She did.

30:31.873 --> 30:35.094
She said he didn't like
her dinner.

30:36.486 --> 30:39.141
- Thank you, Detective Rollins.

30:57.899 --> 31:00.859
- Do you recognize this,
Annabeth?

31:01.772 --> 31:03.470
- Looks like Tommy's gun.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.211
- That's right.

31:05.254 --> 31:07.126
You've seen it before?

31:08.692 --> 31:10.956
Every night when he came home
from work,

31:10.999 --> 31:12.914
he took it out
and he cleaned it.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.830
- And then he put it away
in a gun locker.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.832
- No.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.922
He kept it out where he could
always get to it.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.838
I asked him
I don't know how many times

31:23.882 --> 31:26.406
to put the gun away...

31:26.449 --> 31:28.974
but he refused.

31:29.017 --> 31:32.194
- Did he say why?

31:32.238 --> 31:34.501
- He said he was a cop.

31:34.544 --> 31:37.634
It was part of him.

31:37.678 --> 31:40.115
He said seeing it...

31:40.159 --> 31:43.466
knowing it was there
made him feel strong.

31:43.510 --> 31:44.685
- Like a man?

31:44.728 --> 31:47.688
- That's what he said.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.395
- Objection.
Your Honor.

31:59.439 --> 32:02.181
- What's a trial without some
good old fashioned histrionics?

32:02.224 --> 32:05.271
You've made your point,
Counselor.

32:05.314 --> 32:08.927
- How did the gun
make you feel, Annabeth?

32:10.406 --> 32:13.018
- Weak.

32:13.061 --> 32:14.149
Scared.

32:14.193 --> 32:16.978
It was always
where I could see it.

32:17.022 --> 32:20.677
It was like a lion showing
its teeth to a zebra.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.723
"I'm the king.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.420
You're less than."

32:24.464 --> 32:27.554
- You are not less than.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.251
- That's a joke.

32:29.295 --> 32:33.038
My heart pounds
when I shop for food.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.563
Will Tommy like this,
or will he dump it on the floor

32:36.606 --> 32:38.869
for me to clean up?

32:38.913 --> 32:42.264
My hand, it shakes
when I answer the phone.

32:42.308 --> 32:44.919
It'll be Tommy telling me
his friend saw me flirting

32:44.963 --> 32:47.313
with someone at the cleaner's.

32:47.356 --> 32:50.838
I used to take business classes
at Hunter College.

32:50.881 --> 32:54.146
Tommy told me to quit.
Said I was too stupid.

32:54.189 --> 32:56.583
It was a waste of money.

32:56.626 --> 33:00.848
- Did you ever tell your family
about how he was treating you?

33:03.329 --> 33:05.984
How about a friend?

33:07.811 --> 33:10.466
- I used to have friends.

33:10.510 --> 33:13.208
Lots of them.

33:13.252 --> 33:16.777
Tommy said they weren't
good enough for us.

33:16.820 --> 33:19.867
Now all we have
are his friends.

33:27.483 --> 33:30.660
- Thank you, Annabeth.

33:43.847 --> 33:47.242
- Did your husband
ever hit you, Mrs. Pearl?

33:49.505 --> 33:51.812
Did Tommy ever hit you?

33:53.205 --> 33:55.250
- No.

33:58.732 --> 34:01.343
- Did he ever rape you?

34:03.998 --> 34:07.088
- We had sex lots of times
when I didn't want to.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.485
- Did you tell him that?

34:12.528 --> 34:14.269
- No.

34:14.313 --> 34:16.880
I was too scared.

34:16.924 --> 34:20.493
- So in six years of marriage,
you never once said...

34:20.536 --> 34:21.798
"I'm not in the mood."

34:21.842 --> 34:22.973
"I'm too tired,"
"I have a headache,"

34:23.017 --> 34:26.368
or "I--I just don't want to"?

34:26.412 --> 34:28.327
- No.

34:30.720 --> 34:33.767
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Pearl...

34:33.810 --> 34:35.160
but that's not rape.

34:35.203 --> 34:38.337
- Objection!
- You know better, Mr. Stone.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.165
- That man was raping me

34:40.208 --> 34:43.342
from the moment I said "I do"!

35:03.057 --> 35:05.494
Come on, who ate my jellies?

35:07.801 --> 35:09.107
You okay?

35:09.150 --> 35:10.673
Liv.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

35:10.717 --> 35:12.675
I...

35:12.719 --> 35:14.590
what's happening upstairs?

35:14.634 --> 35:16.331
- Bloodbath.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.724
- Whose blood?

35:17.767 --> 35:20.205
- Well, you know how they say
you only die once?

35:20.248 --> 35:23.904
Well, that's a lie--
at least for Tommy Pearl.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.733
- So Stone is gonna call me.

35:26.776 --> 35:30.302
- If he wants any shot
at winning this case, yeah.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.786
- Fin, what am I gonna do?

35:36.830 --> 35:40.529
- Running's not an option?

35:40.573 --> 35:42.792
I didn't think so.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.098
I mean, as far as I can see,

35:44.142 --> 35:46.013
this is just another case
to me.

35:46.056 --> 35:49.016
- Listen, your BS
doesn't fly with me.

35:49.059 --> 35:50.757
- I should know that by now.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.675
Fin, I'm...

35:55.718 --> 35:58.417
I'm asking you...

36:00.245 --> 36:04.336
Do you think Annabeth
belongs in prison?

36:05.554 --> 36:08.557
- Liv, half the guys
I grew up with are in prison.

36:08.601 --> 36:10.603
Do they belong there?

36:10.646 --> 36:11.995
They don't think so.

36:12.039 --> 36:13.693
- But you do?

36:13.736 --> 36:15.085
- It's not my place to judge.

36:15.129 --> 36:16.522
- Oh, my God.

36:16.565 --> 36:18.959
Again with your BS.

36:19.002 --> 36:21.179
- Look, last Sunday
I went fishing

36:21.222 --> 36:23.877
off of Sheepshead Bay.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.227
Four hours passed,
not a nibble.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.098
Then right when I'm ready
to pack it up,

36:28.142 --> 36:29.361
my rod starts jerking.

36:29.404 --> 36:31.711
So I start reeling.
I'm reeling.

36:31.754 --> 36:35.018
I swear, I've never had
a perp fight that hard.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.585
And then there it was,

36:36.629 --> 36:38.587
flopping around
on the deck of the boat,

36:38.631 --> 36:40.241
a35-pound bluefish.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.939
The most beautiful thing
I've ever seen in my life.

36:42.983 --> 36:46.465
- That's--that's great, Fin.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.032
- I threw it back in the bay.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.255
- Anything that's willing

36:54.299 --> 36:56.866
to fight that hard
to stay alive

36:56.910 --> 36:59.695
deserves to live.

37:06.180 --> 37:07.529
- Like Annabeth.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.879
- Just saying.

37:09.923 --> 37:12.708
- So you're telling me...

37:12.752 --> 37:14.710
to lie.

37:14.754 --> 37:15.972
- I'm just saying,

37:16.016 --> 37:18.888
that blue's not gonna
get hooked again.

37:18.932 --> 37:21.239
But that's just me.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.548
- So I guess
you didn't come here

37:26.592 --> 37:29.682
to get some donuts.

37:31.597 --> 37:34.339
- Lieutenant Benson.

37:35.992 --> 37:38.952
- Part 33.

38:05.892 --> 38:08.764
- Lieutenant Olivia Benson?

38:10.418 --> 38:12.594
- Yes.

38:30.438 --> 38:32.005
- Do you swear
to tell the truth,

38:32.048 --> 38:34.834
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

38:36.575 --> 38:38.838
- I do.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.847
- Please state your name
for the record.

38:47.890 --> 38:50.763
- Lieutenant Olivia Benson.

38:52.504 --> 38:55.158
- Did you have the opportunity
to interrogate the defendant

38:55.202 --> 38:58.510
after she confessed
to killing her husband?

39:00.425 --> 39:02.383
- I did.

39:02.427 --> 39:06.082
- Did she express remorse
for what she did?

39:06.822 --> 39:09.259
- You have to understand,
under the circumstances--

39:09.303 --> 39:12.437
- Please answer the question.

39:14.743 --> 39:17.267
Taken out of context,

39:17.311 --> 39:19.705
her words can be misconstrued.

39:19.748 --> 39:21.054
- Lieutenant.

39:21.097 --> 39:24.187
You just reached out
and put your hand on the Bible

39:24.231 --> 39:28.278
and swore to tell us the truth.

39:32.065 --> 39:35.242
Did the defendant,
Ms. Annabeth Pearl,

39:35.285 --> 39:38.724
express remorse...

39:38.767 --> 39:42.205
for what she did?

39:59.875 --> 40:02.356
- No.

40:07.709 --> 40:11.321
- What, if anything,
did she say in that regard?

40:14.803 --> 40:17.284
- She said that...

40:17.327 --> 40:19.417
she said that she was glad

40:19.460 --> 40:22.768
that her husband was dead...

40:23.725 --> 40:27.294
And that she'd prayed
about it for years.
