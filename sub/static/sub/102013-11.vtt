(insects chirping)

00:10.301 --> 00:11.803
(bird calls)

00:16.808 --> 00:18.101
(grunts softly)

00:21.187 --> 00:23.273
(engine sputters)

00:25.191 --> 00:27.694
Hello? Anyone?

00:35.160 --> 00:38.079
I need to get
to 118 River Heights Drive.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.835
(knocking on door)

00:47.922 --> 00:49.257
Nick, what happened?

00:50.216 --> 00:51.509
Who are you?

00:54.012 --> 00:56.097
♪ ♪

01:06.066 --> 01:08.610
RYAN:  I'm sorry, I'm gonna
have to ask you to repeat that.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.279
Nancy Drew is your daughter.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.948
And why would you think that?

01:13.990 --> 01:16.242
Her DNA.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.456
I can understand
why she kept it a secret.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.333
I mean,
she's right to be afraid.

01:23.374 --> 01:26.461
Can you predict your father's
reaction when I tell him?

01:26.503 --> 01:29.380
Everett has always wanted you
to have a child,

01:29.422 --> 01:30.840
an heir to the company.

01:30.882 --> 01:34.511
But he did not imagine this:
a teenaged girl,

01:34.552 --> 01:38.223
legally an adult,
who can now destroy our family.

01:38.264 --> 01:39.766
And you haven't told him yet?
No.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.060
I wanted to, uh,
to talk to you first.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.812
I wanted to be able
to assure him

01:43.853 --> 01:46.231
that you didn't know anything
until this very moment.

01:46.272 --> 01:49.359
And I would very much like
for that to be true.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.153
Well, of course
I didn't know, Mother.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.363
Good.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.698
I'll handle it.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.242
Don't worry.

01:59.410 --> 02:02.330
NANCY:  His symptoms are
consistent with a severe case

02:02.372 --> 02:04.958
of retrograde amnesia, meaning
he's retained basic skills--

02:04.999 --> 02:07.043
walking, talking, dressing--

02:07.085 --> 02:10.421
however, he does not know who
he is or who any of us are.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.090
Right.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.508
(clears throat)
Okay.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.759
Hi.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.427
NICK: Hey. Sorry about all this.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.264
I just want to
understand who I am.
(Bess chuckles)

02:19.305 --> 02:21.683
Then we should probably
get you changed out of that,

02:21.724 --> 02:24.144
'cause that's not you.
Oh, really?

02:24.185 --> 02:25.770
But it-but it's so warm.

02:25.812 --> 02:26.980
NANCY: You're from Florida.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.523
Not a lot of need for fleece.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.525
I'm from Florida?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.235
Then why am I here in Maine?

02:32.277 --> 02:34.070
It wasn't really
your choice.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.197
You got yourself into a little
bit of trouble when you were 16.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.283
You came for
your friend Tiffany.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.995
BESS: Yeah, who actually
gave you several

02:42.036 --> 02:43.788
millions of dollars.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.291
So, congratulations,
you're a millionaire.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.792
NANCY: Hey, Ace, any luck

02:47.834 --> 02:49.335
tracking down Nick's phone?

02:49.377 --> 02:50.879
Not yet. Keep asking.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.132
Sorry. I'm working on it.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.221
Hey. What's going on?

03:00.263 --> 03:03.057
Got a little mystery of my own.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.643
Hey, isn't that the box
your long-lost brother left you

03:05.685 --> 03:07.854
before he stood you up?

03:07.896 --> 03:09.272
Yep.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.024
My parents have one
just like it.

03:11.065 --> 03:12.901
ACE: I don't know what it means

03:12.942 --> 03:15.445
or why he'd leave a photo
of my dad in it.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.530
And now he's not answering
my texts, either.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.824
I am confused.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.368
GEORGE:
Your name is Ned Nickerson.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.536
NICK:
You call me Nick?

03:23.578 --> 03:24.746
GEORGE:
Your mom's name is Millie.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.582
Mm-hmm.
(continues indistinctly)

03:27.624 --> 03:29.792
Huh.
I am your girlfriend.
That's-that's important.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.002
Okay.
Hey.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.504
Found these
in your pocket.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.881
These familiar to you at all?

03:34.923 --> 03:37.592
No. No, n-never
seen that before.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.345
Then you must have gotten them
before you lost your memory.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.723
Hey, let's make a timeline.
Who saw Nick last night?

03:43.765 --> 03:45.225
Um, Nick called me
around 9:00-ish

03:45.266 --> 03:47.018
to say that he was
crashing with Ace again.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.311
You stay on his couch sometimes.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.604
You bounce around.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.813
ACE:
When we closed up

03:50.855 --> 03:52.607
at 10:00,

03:52.649 --> 03:54.484
Nick said that he was
headed to George's.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.569
So I lied?

03:56.611 --> 03:58.529
Do...

03:58.571 --> 04:00.031
I do that a lot?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.742
Maybe I misheard you.
Uh...

04:02.784 --> 04:04.160
You know what?
I'll go ask my parents

04:04.202 --> 04:05.453
if they saw you last night

04:05.495 --> 04:07.372
and get you
some of your own clothes.

04:07.413 --> 04:11.376
So I'm a...

04:11.417 --> 04:15.046
a lying millionaire
who couch-hops

04:15.088 --> 04:17.257
and has no home.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.883
(phone vibrates)

04:20.718 --> 04:23.012
No, that is not
who you are, Nick.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.056
I have to go.
I have a situation.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.894
That, however,
is exactly who she is.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.646
(door closes)

04:33.231 --> 04:35.984
We have exactly four hours
to save Nancy's life.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.695
'Cause as soon as her
Ladies Who Yacht luncheon docks,

04:38.736 --> 04:40.405
Celia has her weekly
summit meeting with Everett.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.199
She's gonna tell him then.
We cannot let that happen.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.617
No.
Can we

04:44.659 --> 04:46.244
dial down the dramatics
a little bit?

04:46.286 --> 04:49.038
People find out
they're grandparents every day.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.624
Not-not you.
I'm not... Not you guys.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.793
This isn't a joke, Nancy.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.546
Everett's father
made an immutable will.

04:56.587 --> 04:59.966
As Ryan's only child, that means
you'll inherit the company.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.426
Everett won't let
his legacy go to someone

05:01.467 --> 05:03.261
he knows wants to destroy it.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.681
And there's only one way that
he can stop this from happening.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.516
You've both known about this?

05:08.558 --> 05:10.476
Well... yeah.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.228
And you're saying
that he would try and kill me?

05:12.270 --> 05:13.521
If he finds out?

05:13.563 --> 05:15.565
Nancy, he's awaiting trial

05:15.606 --> 05:18.609
because you had him arrested
on 12 counts of murder.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.778
He came after Laura Tandy
and Ace and me

05:20.820 --> 05:22.488
for a hell of a lot
less than that, so...

05:22.530 --> 05:24.699
And you wouldn't be
the first wayward family member

05:24.741 --> 05:26.826
that he ran off of a ski slope.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.329
Thank you for finally telling me
that my life is in danger.

05:29.370 --> 05:30.872
I need to go handle this.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.001
Mom?

05:35.043 --> 05:37.545
Acey. Can I
get you a nosh?

05:37.587 --> 05:39.088
Fully noshed.
Thank you.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.631
Is there any chance
you saw Nick here last night?

05:40.673 --> 05:42.467
No, but I was asleep by 9:00.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.427
It's important
to get those REM cycles.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.518
Hey, Mom, what is this box?

05:52.560 --> 05:53.895
I never told you?

05:53.936 --> 05:55.229
Dad made that.

05:55.271 --> 05:56.856
He gave it to
me the night

05:56.898 --> 05:58.441
he told me
he loved me.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.283
Oh, this is not food-free.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.619
You're not food-free, Grant.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.834
Didn't go well at home, then?

06:16.876 --> 06:19.462
We have this nice, happy life.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.590
What if it's all built on a lie?

06:22.632 --> 06:25.051
What if my dad
knows that he has a son,

06:25.093 --> 06:27.512
this kid who's been growing up
in witness protection,

06:27.553 --> 06:29.138
and he's just been hiding him
from us the whole time?

06:29.180 --> 06:32.892
Well, why don't you
ask your dad about it?

06:32.934 --> 06:34.769
You know, Ace, nothing changes

06:34.811 --> 06:36.229
if nothing changes.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.439
(entry bells chime)

06:41.150 --> 06:43.069
Here's your chance.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.950
You tell me first
what's going on.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.159
NANCY:
Captain?

06:50.201 --> 06:52.620
Ace, is there a problem?

06:53.955 --> 06:56.040
ACE: There was a murder outside
of the historical society

06:56.082 --> 06:57.375
last night.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.461
Aristotle Fellowes.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.255
He's an employee there?

07:02.296 --> 07:03.381
That's the tour guide.

07:06.759 --> 07:10.304
They found Nick's phone
at the scene.

07:10.346 --> 07:14.225
There's also security footage of
his truck leaving the driveway,

07:14.267 --> 07:15.768
just after the time of death.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.520
Well, his estimated
time of death.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.440
ACE: Aristotle was wearing
a step tracker,

07:20.481 --> 07:22.442
so they have an exact time.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.945
Nick is

07:25.987 --> 07:28.197
not here.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.199
I'm a murder suspect?
I should...

07:30.241 --> 07:31.826
Shouldn't I go
talk to them?
No.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.286
You should absolutely not
go talk to them.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.912
Come here.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.248
That's what the window's for.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.877
Climb.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.885
ACE:
I got photos
from the crime scene.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.261
As long as you didn't get them

07:50.303 --> 07:51.971
by hacking your dad's phone.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.974
Okay, whatever.
Let's see.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.267
Oh...

07:56.309 --> 07:58.853
NICK:
They think I did this?

07:58.895 --> 08:00.771
NANCY: Those slash
marks are huge.
No.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.940
What kind of blade
does that?

08:02.982 --> 08:04.817
Uh, maybe it was an animal?

08:04.859 --> 08:07.862
I've never heard of an animal
in Maine with claws that big.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.447
NANCY:
On the floor beside
the body. Zoom in.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.074
Those look to be
the same kind of carved bones

08:12.116 --> 08:13.326
that Nick had on him.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.744
Well, why... w-why would I have

08:14.785 --> 08:16.662
the dead guy's carved bones
if-if I didn't...

08:16.704 --> 08:18.664
You didn't.
Well, we honest.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.625
Could I have killed him?

08:20.666 --> 08:23.878
I mean, h-have I ever done
anything like-like this?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.631
Absolutely not. No.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.801
Younger Futhark.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.470
Okay, look.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.014
I did an image search
on the symbols on the bones.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.308
Those are Younger Futhark runes.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.727
The-the language of Vikings.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.729
Vikings in Maine?
That's random.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.397
Yeah, according to this article,

08:43.439 --> 08:44.941
there was a super-old
Norse penny

08:44.982 --> 08:47.401
excavated near
Mount Desert Island.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.111
Okay, Vikings, pennies.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.321
None of this brings us
any closer

08:50.363 --> 08:51.989
to solving Nick's memory loss.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.200
NANCY:
That might.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.245
That security camera
recorded Nick's truck

08:57.286 --> 08:58.538
pulling out of here.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.541
And your truck
left something behind.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.710
There was oil
on Nick's shirt.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.295
The one he was
wearing last night.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.802
Nick, you left
a trail for us.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.974
(truck door opens)

09:18.015 --> 09:21.894
BESS:
Okay, it says,
"Only use fan in emergency."

09:21.936 --> 09:24.981
What is it,
like a heat emergency?

09:25.022 --> 09:26.440
It looks like something's
hooked up to the engine.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.484
I saw a description
for this device

09:28.526 --> 09:30.903
in Hannah's ledger,
it was in box 45.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.697
It's hooked up
to the vent system,

09:32.738 --> 09:36.158
so the substance from
this globe gets pulled in

09:36.200 --> 09:39.745
and then released
through the fan.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.163
Yeah, did I mention
you were a mechanic

09:41.205 --> 09:42.582
before you bought a restaurant?

09:42.623 --> 09:44.292
NANCY:
I remember
an alchemist built it

09:44.333 --> 09:46.711
to try and cure
her husband's dementia.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.838
Did you take this from
the archive boxes?

09:49.797 --> 09:51.173
To do what?

09:51.215 --> 09:53.926
E-Erase my own memory?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.344
Bess, will you start it up?

09:55.386 --> 09:56.637
Yeah.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.806
(engine sputters)

09:58.848 --> 10:00.224
No. Nothing.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.767
ACE:
It's out of gas.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.811
Good thing I always keep
a backup nosh for Florence.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.981
Hey. Check out
these slash marks.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.649
I think they're the
same as the ones

10:08.691 --> 10:10.401
that were on
Aristotle's body.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.612
BESS:
Well, whatever
killed Aristotle--

10:12.653 --> 10:14.155
maybe that's what came for Nick.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.781
GEORGE:
There's an easy
way to find out.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.122
ACE:
I mean, is that a good idea?
We still don't know

10:23.164 --> 10:25.124
why Nick erased his memory.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.001
NICK:
Yeah, well,

10:27.043 --> 10:29.045
I need to know.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.723
(coughing)

10:40.765 --> 10:43.017
You okay?

10:43.059 --> 10:44.810
Nick?

10:46.729 --> 10:48.731
You shouldn't have
let me get my memories back.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.149
You need to leave.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.776
Now!
Wait, wha-what's going on?

10:51.817 --> 10:53.402
What do you
remember?

10:53.444 --> 10:54.862
Why did you erase your
memory in the first place?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.113
Because it was coming for me.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.448
And now it's gonna come again.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.908
You need to get
in the car and go.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.701
Now! Go!

11:00.743 --> 11:02.161
GEORGE:
Wait, Nick... Wait.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.871
George, please.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.456
You need to trust me, okay?

11:05.498 --> 11:06.666
What is going on?

11:06.707 --> 11:08.793
Just go.
Okay.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.879
(engine starts)

11:19.136 --> 11:20.846
(crackling nearby)

11:24.809 --> 11:27.937
(screeching)

11:36.779 --> 11:38.698
(low growling)

11:39.990 --> 11:41.283
(screeching, roaring)

11:44.912 --> 11:46.997
(grunting)

11:49.041 --> 11:52.545
(coughing)

12:16.360 --> 12:18.446
Hello?

12:21.073 --> 12:23.159
Anyone?

12:25.369 --> 12:27.455
Hello?

12:36.088 --> 12:37.715
Nick, you're okay!
Uh, who are you?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.550
Wait... You know me?

12:39.592 --> 12:42.762
Yeah, you erased
your memory, again.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.638
Here, read this.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.390
Okay, so we can
rule out an animal.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.933
Or anything
of this world, right?

12:47.975 --> 12:49.602
Yeah.
New slash marks.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.771
So whatever came after
Nick before came again.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.856
(phone vibrates, honks)
But why, because
of something Nick knew?

12:55.232 --> 12:57.401
Either way, we're not
restoring his memory

12:57.443 --> 12:58.986
until we can figure
out what that is.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.738
ACE:
The cops think that

13:00.780 --> 13:02.239
Nick killed
Aristotle.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.618
Hiding from them
is not helping.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.620
You need a lawyer.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.666
NICK:
Whoa.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.544
Yeah, this is a...
this is a cool space.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.839
We should start
the interview.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.801
Thom?

13:21.842 --> 13:23.928
You ready?

13:33.270 --> 13:36.232
Your client lost his memory.

13:36.273 --> 13:39.693
He can't answer
any of my questions,

13:39.735 --> 13:43.197
yet he still knows ASL.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.242
That's common
with amnesia.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.205
Do you

13:51.247 --> 13:53.415
remember learning ASL

13:53.457 --> 13:55.876
to communicate
with your little cousin?

13:55.918 --> 13:57.586
Oh...

13:57.628 --> 13:59.713
no.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.716
You remember

14:02.758 --> 14:05.636
fixing all

14:05.678 --> 14:08.138
the wobbly chairs
in my house?

14:08.180 --> 14:09.849
Uh... (chuckles)

14:09.890 --> 14:12.560
no, I don't, but you're welcome.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.687
(laughs)

14:18.941 --> 14:21.902
Did you kill Aristotle
in self-defense?

14:21.944 --> 14:24.113
What?

14:26.323 --> 14:28.909
What? No, no.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.789
I, um...

14:33.831 --> 14:35.791
I don't know.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.586
You know

14:38.627 --> 14:41.338
about my criminal history.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.883
What-what history?

14:43.924 --> 14:46.093
Hey, what-what'd I do?

14:46.135 --> 14:47.303
Hey, hey, Nick.
What'd I do?

14:47.344 --> 14:48.804
Thom, can we just
give him a minute?

14:48.846 --> 14:50.389
Nick?

14:55.811 --> 14:57.897
A few years ago...

14:57.938 --> 14:59.940
you were attacked...

14:59.982 --> 15:02.401
at a party, and...

15:02.443 --> 15:04.987
while you were
defending yourself...

15:05.029 --> 15:07.114
you...

15:11.785 --> 15:13.996
I...

15:14.038 --> 15:17.374
I killed someone?

15:17.416 --> 15:18.876
In self-defense.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.006
You served two years
for manslaughter.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.384
No.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.386
I killed someone?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.347
I...

15:31.388 --> 15:33.474
That's not...

15:36.226 --> 15:38.562
N-no.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.820
No, I just...

15:46.862 --> 15:48.864
I don't remember...

15:48.906 --> 15:51.450
I don't...

15:51.492 --> 15:54.745
Hmm, Aristotle had
his share of nemeses.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.123
Here's two of them now.
Oh, my gosh.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.959
ARISTOTLE:
History isn't feeling.
This is at the chapel.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.585
It's fact.
And how do you know that?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.587
Ah! That's us!

16:03.629 --> 16:05.381
Did anyone comment
on Nancy's awesome zinger?

16:05.422 --> 16:08.092
(clears throat) Can someone
sign my time card?

16:08.133 --> 16:10.010
W-Wait, hold on,
there's, like,

16:10.052 --> 16:12.012
300 mean comments
about Aristotle.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.306
Bots.
Troll bots.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.558
Most likely operated
by one garbage human

16:16.600 --> 16:18.143
who's too lazy
to spread their own hate.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.270
Garbage enough
to kill Aristotle?

16:20.312 --> 16:22.314
I'm running software

16:22.356 --> 16:24.233
to try and track down
the troll master.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.526
And I'm scrolling
through Instagram

16:25.567 --> 16:27.152
while we wait.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.529
Since we're
all announcing

16:28.570 --> 16:30.030
what we're doing.
ACE: Found it.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.032
Got an IP address.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.243
Yada, yada.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.078
Troll's name is Mark Matter.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.538
(phone vibrates)

16:37.579 --> 16:39.915
Whoa, he was
Aristotle's roommate.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.376
(sighs) Sorry,
can you guys talk to him?

16:42.418 --> 16:44.670
Um, I have to go do this...

16:44.712 --> 16:46.380
family thing.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.715
Yeah, okay.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.806
Get in!

16:56.890 --> 16:59.476
Or I could keep honking.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.145
It would be great for them
to see your granddaughter

17:01.186 --> 17:02.479
making a scene, right?

17:02.521 --> 17:04.023
(horn honks)

17:04.064 --> 17:06.900
Well, I see that Ryan told you,

17:06.942 --> 17:09.028
which is both disappointing...

17:11.447 --> 17:13.365
...and predictable.
Listen,

17:13.407 --> 17:15.117
I do not want
Hudson Enterprises.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.036
So I will sign whatever.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.371
The company passes
to you automatically.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.957
And one could suspect
that you're already

17:21.999 --> 17:24.877
trying to expedite the process
by having Everett arrested.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.503
I wanted justice
for his victims.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.172
I... It was not a coup.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.631
Look, I know that there's
a way that we can work this out.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.092
This is not a negotiation.

17:33.677 --> 17:34.720
Kindly let go of me.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.556
I am really sorry about this.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.101
(moans, coughing)

17:41.143 --> 17:42.686
Nancy!

17:43.937 --> 17:46.023
(coughing)

17:51.111 --> 17:54.156
No. I trolled Aristotle
so I wouldn't kill him.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.824
The guy was the worst roommate.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.452
Even with all this awesome
Viking-centric decor?

17:58.494 --> 18:01.330
Well, Aristotle got all that
from some fringe archaeologists.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.832
He was doing a podcast
on their Viking dig site.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.918
Bunch of nerds.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.005
Do you have any
of the contact information

18:10.047 --> 18:12.633
for the archaeologists?
No one's heard from them
in a week.

18:12.674 --> 18:15.094
Aristotle went to the dig site
yesterday to look for them.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.937
I killed someone.

18:24.978 --> 18:27.397
I had to learn it from...

18:27.439 --> 18:29.525
Ace's dad.

18:29.566 --> 18:32.402
Not from my friends.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.115
Not my girlfriend.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.284
Is it...

18:39.326 --> 18:42.079
is it because
you're ashamed of me?

18:42.121 --> 18:45.124
No. No,

18:45.165 --> 18:46.875
no.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.836
Anything but that.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.754
Look, I didn't know
how to tell you

18:50.796 --> 18:52.631
about the worst trauma
of your life.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.219
I didn't want you to have to
go through that again.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.056
(entry bells jingle)

19:01.098 --> 19:03.100
Oh.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.935
What a cute little restaurant.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.062
Isn't it?
(laughs)

19:07.104 --> 19:09.523
Psst!

19:09.565 --> 19:12.151
Did you put her memories
in the same bottle with Nick's?

19:12.192 --> 19:14.069
Is Nick gonna come back
part-Celia?

19:14.111 --> 19:15.737
No. No, no, no. No.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.240
Uh, the ledger says
that a person's memory

19:18.282 --> 19:21.118
is tied to them, so he'll
get his memories back.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.786
Listen,
Bess and Ace

19:22.828 --> 19:25.038
found audio files
from Aristotle's trip

19:25.080 --> 19:26.957
to a Viking dig site.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.042
I'm gonna drop
you a pin, okay?

19:30.002 --> 19:32.087
Ooh.
(chuckles)

19:38.927 --> 19:40.095
Nancy.
Hmm?

19:40.137 --> 19:41.305
Hey, what's the emergency?

19:41.346 --> 19:43.682
Ryan... okay.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.809
I tried to reason with Celia,
I really did,

19:45.851 --> 19:49.146
but, uh, it didn't work,
and I panicked

19:49.188 --> 19:50.856
and I erased her memory.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.399
You...
Just to buy us
a little bit of time.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.775
I'm gonna fix it.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.319
Just keep an eye on her.
And, you know,

19:55.360 --> 19:57.446
she's kind of sweet now.
So...

19:58.363 --> 20:00.073
Hi.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.201
And you are?

20:04.077 --> 20:07.039
ARISTOTLE:
This week on Aristotle.

20:07.080 --> 20:10.209
A couple hundred Vikings
settled in Maine

20:10.250 --> 20:12.252
long before Columbus pulled up.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.005
All those settlers
died suddenly,

20:15.047 --> 20:17.758
for reasons yet unknown.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.052
Mystifying.

20:20.093 --> 20:22.179
This is a
terrible podcast.

20:22.221 --> 20:26.308
So why isn't Maine
called some crazy Viking name?

20:26.350 --> 20:29.645
They left murals of a god
they worshipped, but destroyed

20:29.686 --> 20:32.314
all evidence of its name.
Why?

20:32.356 --> 20:34.399
Did their god turn on them
and kill them?

20:34.441 --> 20:37.778
Notes from the two archeologists
who found the site indicate so.

20:37.819 --> 20:40.239
But they've now disappeared,

20:40.280 --> 20:42.324
their research unfinished.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.825
Where'd they go?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.327
These slash marks
are the same ones

20:45.369 --> 20:46.578
we found on Nick's truck

20:46.620 --> 20:48.330
and Aristotle's body.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.916
So this homicidal god

20:50.958 --> 20:54.294
got to the archaeologists first,
then went after Aristotle?

20:57.172 --> 20:59.299
Found Aristotle's notebook.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.389
NANCY:
He tore that page out
in a hurry.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.733
I think it's the god's name.

21:16.775 --> 21:17.943
Gr...

21:17.985 --> 21:21.571
(gasping breaths)

21:21.613 --> 21:23.240
Aah!

21:24.533 --> 21:26.576
Was that me?

21:32.082 --> 21:34.501
Is that me?

21:34.543 --> 21:36.253
Who are you?

21:39.589 --> 21:41.591
I have no idea.

21:47.180 --> 21:49.433
BESS:
it says, "Only use
fan in emergency."

21:49.474 --> 21:52.144
What, like a
heat emergency?

21:58.775 --> 22:00.444
ACE:
I guess we inhaled.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.199
Ooh, is this place a restaurant?

22:11.872 --> 22:15.917
"Nick Nickerson.
Good at building stuff.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.753
"Suspect in a murder
investigation,

22:17.794 --> 22:19.588
but don't worry,
you are innocent."

22:19.629 --> 22:21.256
Want to trade?

22:21.298 --> 22:23.842
I have a dead
French lady inside me.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.094
My name is George,
and I am your...

22:26.136 --> 22:28.180
girlfriend.
Hey...

22:28.221 --> 22:29.556
Hi.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.933
Basically, there were
these Vikings.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.269
They worshipped a god,
the god killed them all,

22:34.311 --> 22:37.731
and now it murders
anyone who knows its name.

22:37.773 --> 22:42.319
Right. So then,
we figured that out,

22:42.361 --> 22:44.780
but survived
by erasing our memory

22:44.821 --> 22:48.200
using the device
in that truck.

22:48.241 --> 22:51.620
Okay, why should we
believe any of this?

22:55.665 --> 22:57.042
"When George asks

22:57.084 --> 22:59.586
why we should
believe any of this..."

22:59.628 --> 23:02.005
Oh.
"Because I said so."

23:02.047 --> 23:03.673
Okay, well...

23:07.052 --> 23:08.678
What to do.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.972
"Document damage
from previous attempt."

23:11.014 --> 23:12.474
"Form new plan."

23:12.516 --> 23:15.143
"Summon entity
by flipping over card

23:15.185 --> 23:17.979
labeled
'flip for entity's name...'"

23:18.021 --> 23:21.691
Thank you.
"If new plan fails,

23:21.733 --> 23:24.486
"turn on fan in truck
to erase memories.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.655
Start over."

23:26.696 --> 23:28.490
How many times
have we done this?

23:28.532 --> 23:30.826
I'm Ace.

23:30.867 --> 23:33.662
I'm not sure if that's
a first name or a last name.

23:33.703 --> 23:36.498
Okay, um, I'm
Bess Marvin.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.208
I'm a social
media savant,

23:38.250 --> 23:41.044
a former klepto,
and...

23:41.086 --> 23:43.922
into girls.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.215
Sorry.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.633
Oh.

23:48.343 --> 23:51.179
Hey. "Watch the video
on Nancy's phone."

23:52.055 --> 23:54.349
Which one of you is Nancy?

23:58.770 --> 24:00.981
If you're watching this,
attempt five--

24:01.022 --> 24:03.733
water-gunning the entity
with holy water--

24:03.775 --> 24:05.485
did not work.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.363
(Nancy panting)

24:08.405 --> 24:10.949
NANCY:
How do I not remember
any of this?

24:11.908 --> 24:13.869
Okay, well, hi, guys.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.954
Sixth time's a charm, right?

24:15.996 --> 24:17.414
(whoops)

24:17.456 --> 24:19.124
Go team.
(giggles)

24:20.459 --> 24:24.129
(gasping)

24:24.171 --> 24:25.714
Aah!

24:25.755 --> 24:27.841
What's happening?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.555
Is that me?

24:33.597 --> 24:35.891
(gasps)
Who are you?

24:37.350 --> 24:40.520
If you're watching this,
attempt seven--

24:40.562 --> 24:42.105
slingshotting the steak knives
at the entity--

24:42.147 --> 24:44.024
did not work.

24:50.614 --> 24:52.741
How can I not remember
any of this?

24:52.782 --> 24:54.993
How can I not
remember any of this?

24:55.035 --> 24:58.205
How can I not remember
any of this?

24:58.246 --> 25:02.209
(gasping)

25:02.250 --> 25:04.169
Aah!

25:04.211 --> 25:05.504
Idea.

25:05.545 --> 25:06.755
For attempt number 17,

25:06.796 --> 25:08.465
we'll shoot
acid-filled balloons at it

25:08.507 --> 25:10.383
using a tennis ball machine.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.886
Do you think this set
of slash marks looks

25:12.928 --> 25:14.721
bigger than the rest?
Yo, slash marks,

25:14.763 --> 25:17.516
we're headed to find
a tennis ball machine.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.643
(entry bells jingle)

25:21.144 --> 25:22.979
(door opens)
CELIA:
Nancy?

25:23.939 --> 25:26.650
I brought doughnuts
to say thank you.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.402
You know my name?

25:30.362 --> 25:31.655
We've met?

25:31.696 --> 25:33.615
I thought amnesia
was my thing.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.951
I only know that I really
needed to see you,

25:35.992 --> 25:38.036
so I snuck out.

25:39.287 --> 25:42.082
Is that one of those machines
that plays music?

25:58.056 --> 26:00.934
I'd give anything
to know who I am.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.019

ACE:

26:40.056 --> 26:41.850
(sighs)

26:57.574 --> 26:59.868
NANCY:
If you're watching this,

26:59.909 --> 27:02.454
it's because you failed
to defeat an evil entity

27:02.495 --> 27:06.082
that kills anyone
who learns its name.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.418
Many...

27:08.460 --> 27:11.379
many times.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.840
You only survived
by erasing your memory

27:13.882 --> 27:16.384
using a special substance

27:16.426 --> 27:18.511
in this device.

27:21.222 --> 27:23.850
You just took
the very last dose

27:23.892 --> 27:26.227
of the amnesia substance.

27:26.269 --> 27:29.856
So this time
if you learn the entity's name,

27:29.898 --> 27:31.691
it will kill you.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.361
The only way to survive
is to give up.

27:34.402 --> 27:37.280
You can never
restore your memories.

27:38.239 --> 27:40.617
This is your life now.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.545
So I guess this is the first day
of the rest of our lives.

27:52.587 --> 27:54.547
You're giving up?

27:54.589 --> 27:57.342
It does sound like
we get killed if we don't.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.885
If we do give up,

27:58.927 --> 28:01.388
the people we were before
are already dead.

28:01.429 --> 28:04.015
(French accent):
Move on, you stubborn fools.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.601
Oh, salut.

28:06.643 --> 28:10.355
I'm Odette, the ghost
trapped in George's body.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.815
Hmm.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.733
You wrote about me.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.364
But do ignore
the last part.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.366
I should just let you
end things,

28:21.408 --> 28:23.660
but alas, I am a gentlewoman,

28:23.702 --> 28:25.870
and I have made a vow
to keep George alive.

28:25.912 --> 28:28.415
And one of you I actually like.

28:28.456 --> 28:31.084
So I must stop you

28:31.126 --> 28:33.503
from fighting a battle
you will not win.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.714
Your memories are
not worth dying for.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.174
No, our memories are
what make us who we are,

28:38.216 --> 28:40.260
and that is worth
fighting for.

28:40.301 --> 28:43.513
I would risk everything
to know who I am.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.932
ACE:
We still don't know

28:45.974 --> 28:48.893
why the god
turned on the Vikings,

28:48.935 --> 28:50.186
but it killed them.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.397
It kills anyone
who learns its name.

28:52.439 --> 28:53.815
The slash marks--

28:53.857 --> 28:55.734
they almost always
span the same width,

28:55.775 --> 28:57.444
except for in two instances,

28:57.485 --> 29:00.029
where they're wider
and they did more damage.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.532
Like the entity was
more powerful those times.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.117
Well, those two attempts
aren't labeled,

29:04.159 --> 29:05.994
so maybe that was before
we started trying to kill it.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.371
I was the only one who knew
about the entity at that point.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.374
So the marks it left
were smaller

29:11.416 --> 29:13.793
when all five of us
knew its name,

29:13.835 --> 29:16.087
versus when only
Nick knew its name.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.549
What if this thing gets
less powerful

29:19.591 --> 29:22.093
when more people know its name?

29:22.135 --> 29:23.970
But tons of Vikings
knew its name,

29:24.012 --> 29:26.014
so how did it kill
all of them?

29:26.055 --> 29:27.515
I don't think it did.

29:27.557 --> 29:30.185
So, fun fact: I must
have been teaching myself

29:30.226 --> 29:32.937
to translate the
Vikings' language.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.564
It says

29:34.606 --> 29:37.567
"Soon the disease
will kill us all."

29:37.609 --> 29:40.653
What, the Vikings died from
the disease, not the entity?

29:40.695 --> 29:43.281
What if these hundreds of
Vikings knowing its name,

29:43.323 --> 29:46.117
I mean, uh, what if their,
uh, their group knowledge

29:46.159 --> 29:49.245
is what kept this entity in a-
in a weak or inactive state?

29:49.287 --> 29:50.622
NANCY:
Yes.

29:50.663 --> 29:52.457
That's why they tried
to erase its name

29:52.499 --> 29:54.667
before they all died
from the disease.

29:54.709 --> 29:56.044
ACE:
And...

29:56.085 --> 29:58.087
people who have learned
the name since--

29:58.129 --> 30:00.340
the two archaeologists, dead,

30:00.381 --> 30:03.718
Aristotle, dead, and us.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.136
Not dead yet.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.638
If we're gonna conquer
this thing,

30:06.679 --> 30:08.932
then we need a lot of people
to know its name.

30:11.392 --> 30:12.477
"Bess Marvin.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.395
Social media savant."

30:14.437 --> 30:16.940
Go forth and gather
thy devices. Come on.

30:18.691 --> 30:20.819
NICK:
Okay...

30:20.860 --> 30:22.654
this thing is holding
our memories,

30:22.695 --> 30:24.989
and I want my past back
no matter what.

30:25.031 --> 30:27.075
I'm in.
Me, too.
Me, too.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.786
You all risked everything
to help me.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.833
Okay, I'm going first.

30:34.874 --> 30:37.210
I'll lure it away
and buy you some time.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.466
(inhaling)

30:44.300 --> 30:47.387
ANNOUNCER: Looking to pass.
Harris looking deep,
(door opens)

30:47.428 --> 30:48.930
but has to get rid of it,
a shovel pass.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.057
Cortez was almost immediately
(door closes)

30:51.099 --> 30:52.851
taken down by the defense.

30:52.892 --> 30:54.727
Uh...
Aristotle?

30:54.769 --> 30:56.187
Huh?
Can I help you?

30:56.229 --> 30:57.814
I need to get
into box 45.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.566
There's a memory-erasing
device inside.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.192
I read about it in
Hannah's ledger.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.569
I need it...

31:02.610 --> 31:05.989
(grunts)
so I can forget its name.

31:06.030 --> 31:08.157
It's coming.
Okay.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.034
Okay. Uh, I'll-I'll
have to open the box

31:10.076 --> 31:12.161
through the security system.
It'll take a sec.
Okay.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.753
It's here, the
Grimathorn, outside.

31:20.795 --> 31:23.131
The... Grima-what?
Oh!

31:23.172 --> 31:24.465
I'm sorry.

31:24.507 --> 31:26.301
Now you're next.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.595
Get the device.
It's the only way we survive.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.346
I-I'll lock the windows.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.101
Hey, hey. Uh, Aristotle,
you dropped something.

31:35.143 --> 31:36.561
(Grimathorn roars)
Aah!

31:38.187 --> 31:39.647
(screaming)

31:43.776 --> 31:45.278
Hey. Hey, hey!

31:45.320 --> 31:47.280
(gasping, screaming)

31:47.322 --> 31:49.365
Oh, my God.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.492
(Aristotle screaming)
(Grimathorn growling)

31:53.328 --> 31:55.288

31:55.330 --> 31:57.415

32:00.668 --> 32:02.754
(footsteps speeding up)
(growling intensifies)

32:05.548 --> 32:07.342
Y'all got this?

32:08.885 --> 32:11.054
Yeah, yeah.
Memories restored.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.847
Some better than others.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.390
Good luck, Nick.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.684
Hey.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.942
Hey. I'm not the girl
you kiss goodbye.

32:23.983 --> 32:25.693
I'm the girl who goes
with you into the fight.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.153
Write that on your hand.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.696
Okay.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.576

32:51.719 --> 32:53.972
We need visuals.

33:05.191 --> 33:08.027
Got it, resharing it.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.946
Tagging everyone
I can think of.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.952
Hey, what's going on
over there?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.246
The retweets are rolling in,
but we're still pre-viral.

33:18.287 --> 33:21.332
Yeah, we need
a-a dozen influencers, uh,

33:21.374 --> 33:23.126
two scandal-ridden pop stars,
or...

33:23.167 --> 33:24.794
Mark's trollbot network.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.254
Hacking now.

Whoa!

33:31.509 --> 33:33.594
(banging, clattering)

33:35.680 --> 33:36.681
I'm in.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.141
It's not working yet.

33:49.444 --> 33:51.571

34:15.887 --> 34:17.180
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.514
What?

34:18.556 --> 34:19.974
Listen.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.520
(shouts)

34:25.897 --> 34:28.024
(gasps)

34:28.066 --> 34:30.860
It's just an idol now.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.489
(sighs)

34:34.530 --> 34:36.491
Think it'll
stay this way?

34:37.825 --> 34:39.911
If enough people
know about it.

34:41.204 --> 34:44.832
This idol form must have been
what the Vikings worshipped.

34:44.874 --> 34:47.335
Now we're
worshipping it, too.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.216
Okay, we're locking
this thing

34:53.257 --> 34:54.550
in an archive box.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.344
I'm ready
to never see it again.

34:56.385 --> 34:58.346
Okay.

35:00.556 --> 35:02.058
CARSON:
You...

35:02.100 --> 35:05.269
used a supernatural device

35:05.311 --> 35:08.106
to erase all of
Celia's memories.

35:08.147 --> 35:09.690
Yeah.

35:11.025 --> 35:12.318
(sighs)

35:12.360 --> 35:14.654
Maybe I am more Hudson
than Drew.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.280
You're my daughter.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.700
And you can still
do the right thing.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.955
You may have their blood...

35:23.996 --> 35:26.791
but you're a Drew at heart.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.337
Thanks, Dad.

35:32.713 --> 35:35.466
I really needed
to hear that from you.

35:35.508 --> 35:36.801
(sighs)

35:36.843 --> 35:40.054
And if I fix this--
when I fix this--

35:42.473 --> 35:44.308
...I'm gonna need you close.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.145
So...

35:49.647 --> 35:51.607
Will you come home?

35:59.115 --> 36:01.576
Of course.
(chuckles)

36:05.454 --> 36:07.165
RYAN:
I just have to ask this.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.208
A-Are you sure
about this?

36:09.250 --> 36:10.459
Because this
is your life.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.253
I know.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.130
But I made a promise to her
when we didn't know who we were.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.798
As soon as you do this,
she gonna put

36:15.840 --> 36:17.717
a target on your back.
She might.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.468
But she's also gonna
remember everything

36:19.510 --> 36:21.095
that happened
the past few days.

36:21.137 --> 36:24.765
And if there is any
of this Celia left...

36:24.807 --> 36:27.685
there's a chance
my plan could work.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.981
Good luck.

36:33.107 --> 36:34.609
Hey, Ma?
Yeah?

36:34.650 --> 36:36.235
I'll see you soon.

36:36.277 --> 36:37.862
Aw...
Bye, sweetie.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.697
Bye, Ryan.

36:41.157 --> 36:43.201
Come here.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.828
Look how tiny you were.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.580
Aw.
(chuckles)

36:48.706 --> 36:51.083
Wouldn't it be nice
if I was your granddaughter?

36:52.084 --> 36:54.837
Oh... wouldn't
that be wonderful.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.758
Uh, you hold that thought.
Oh.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.092
(chuckles)

37:00.134 --> 37:01.928
Look, I know
we have our differences,

37:01.969 --> 37:04.138
and there's no hard evidence
to back this,

37:04.180 --> 37:05.681
but you got to believe me.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.892
Nick is innocent.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.353
You know his heart.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.938
I mean, you just got

I have to.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.191
If he finds out that I knew

38:39.233 --> 38:41.277
and I kept it
a secret from him...

38:41.319 --> 38:43.821
that would be very bad.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.865
I saw a different side
to you today.

38:45.906 --> 38:47.658
The kind of person
that you would be

38:47.700 --> 38:49.952
if you did not have the memories
that made you who you are.

38:49.994 --> 38:53.622
Being sweet and believing
that people were good--

38:53.664 --> 38:56.584
that was never
gonna protect me in life.
I know.

38:56.625 --> 38:59.503
And I know that you gave up
a lot to become a Hudson.

39:00.796 --> 39:02.840
But if you can do it, so can I.

39:04.383 --> 39:07.470
I made you a promise,
and I kept it.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.973
You can trust me.

39:11.015 --> 39:14.143
I can be an asset
to this family.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.188
But I need your help
getting Everett to trust me.

39:19.523 --> 39:21.942
We'll see how that goes.

39:27.239 --> 39:29.700
Hey, um...
(clears throat)

39:32.620 --> 39:36.499
I'm sorry I lied to you
the other night about...

39:36.540 --> 39:40.795
going to eat ice cream alone

39:40.836 --> 39:43.130
at the historical society.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.465
Hey.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.841
Sometimes you need space.

39:45.883 --> 39:47.968
It's okay.
I get it.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.597
Well, maybe it's a...

39:51.639 --> 39:54.433
survival mechanism.

39:57.978 --> 40:00.648
(clears throat) In juvie,

40:00.689 --> 40:03.067
it was easier to survive

40:03.109 --> 40:06.362
if I took up less space.

40:09.281 --> 40:11.742
And so I taught
myself to...

40:12.701 --> 40:14.745
...to need less.

40:16.914 --> 40:19.834
It felt like what I deserved.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.546
Well...

40:23.587 --> 40:26.507
how can I help you man-spread?

40:27.466 --> 40:29.802
Oh, I'm ready.
Mm.

40:29.844 --> 40:32.930
I'm ready to-to get
a space of my own,

40:32.972 --> 40:35.182
with enou-enough room
to build stuff,

40:35.224 --> 40:36.725

40:37.726 --> 40:39.854

41:05.463 --> 41:06.755
Hey!
Hi.

41:06.797 --> 41:09.550
You're buying
the whole building?

41:09.592 --> 41:11.010
It's a good investment,
right?

41:11.051 --> 41:12.052

Grant, if this is
about your timecard...

41:18.517 --> 41:19.894
I need to talk to you.
