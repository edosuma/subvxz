WEBVTT

00:16.850 --> 00:20.301
Nobody walks in
Walking in L.A.

00:38.366 --> 00:41.623
This is disgusting.

01:26.296 --> 01:29.605
If you're picking me up at 9,
8:50, I'm kerbside.

01:29.629 --> 01:31.519
- Got caught up in something.
- What?

01:31.543 --> 01:34.101
You don't have a TV,
you don't read the newspaper,

01:34.125 --> 01:36.652
you clearly don't spend any time
getting ready.

01:36.676 --> 01:38.152
Well, maybe I was working out.

01:38.176 --> 01:40.614
- Heh, you don't work out.
- I run.

01:40.638 --> 01:42.446
Yeah,
when people are shooting at us.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.887
Mm-hm. All right, you know what?
I slept in.

01:45.315 --> 01:48.458
- With who? You barely sleep.
- There's nobody.

01:48.482 --> 01:50.620
It would be great for you
to be in a relationship.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.623
How many times will we have
this conversation?

01:52.647 --> 01:54.127
You are my partner, not my mother.

01:54.151 --> 01:56.008
I just want you to be happy

01:56.032 --> 01:57.316
and find a good girl.

01:58.703 --> 01:59.759
Finally.

01:59.783 --> 02:01.970
Nice of you gentlemen to join us.

02:01.994 --> 02:03.470
Eric?

02:03.494 --> 02:05.244
Calvin Lee.

02:06.003 --> 02:09.811
Age 31, submarine nuclear physicist
who just made lieutenant commander

02:09.835 --> 02:13.517
and was about to ship out
on a six-month deployment as the XO.

02:13.541 --> 02:17.551
Until he hanged himself
this morning.

02:18.056 --> 02:19.147
Now the problem is

02:19.171 --> 02:22.492
that his sub was test-driving
a hydrophonic decoy system,

02:22.516 --> 02:25.034
which is a fancy way of saying
that we can now trick

02:25.058 --> 02:27.876
those underwater microphones
that track our subs.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.205
Anyway, with the XO dead,

02:29.229 --> 02:32.047
SecNav wants to know
if the deployment's been compromised.

02:32.071 --> 02:33.376
Now...

02:33.400 --> 02:37.926
This footage was caught
by some bachelorettes.

02:37.950 --> 02:42.922
Initial forensics puts the time of death
at around 6 a.m. This morning.

02:42.946 --> 02:45.638
Well, the suicide was pretty dramatic
and very public.

02:45.662 --> 02:47.519
He obviously wanted people
to see him.

02:47.543 --> 02:49.063
Maybe he was making a statement.

02:49.087 --> 02:51.140
Maybe he didn't want back
on that sub.

02:51.164 --> 02:55.065
No, he worked awfully hard to become
a lieutenant commander at 31.

02:55.089 --> 02:59.317
XO on a sub, it's a pretty big
assignment. I don't buy it.

02:59.341 --> 03:03.323
Suicidal people usually leave a trail,
if you know what to look for.

03:03.347 --> 03:07.114
Sam and I will hit the crime scene.
Kensi, check out the house.

03:07.138 --> 03:08.892
And bring Nate.

03:09.817 --> 03:12.463
- You're actually letting me out again?
- On a short leash.

03:12.487 --> 03:15.037
- And a muzzle.
- Clean up after him.

03:15.061 --> 03:18.573
- Do you want a piece of this too?
- Uh, don't let him hump your leg.

03:20.036 --> 03:21.495
What?

03:22.956 --> 03:25.257
All right, so he parked right there,

03:25.281 --> 03:27.474
tied the rope off,

03:27.498 --> 03:29.958
- jumped from here.
- Or he was tossed.

03:33.049 --> 03:34.876
The knot looks right for a sailor.

03:36.344 --> 03:39.630
Assuming it was suicide, why here?

03:40.932 --> 03:44.324
I don't know. Maybe this place
has some sort of significance

03:44.348 --> 03:46.369
or it's near something.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.911
Maybe he wanted someone to see him
when they drove by.

03:48.935 --> 03:52.867
Hopefully Eric can find
some traffic cams or something

03:52.891 --> 03:55.062
to shed a little light on this thing.

04:01.829 --> 04:04.284
It's quite a view
for your last look at life.

04:04.873 --> 04:07.958
Yeah, quite a view.

04:30.650 --> 04:32.642
This is one squared-away sailor.

04:33.235 --> 04:36.794
CDs are organised
by artist and release date.

04:36.818 --> 04:37.997
Tsk, tsk.

04:38.021 --> 04:40.666
Very obsessive-compulsive.

04:40.690 --> 04:43.442
You should see his sock drawer.

04:45.331 --> 04:47.656
This looks like a girlfriend.

04:50.002 --> 04:51.177
Relationship gone sour?

04:51.201 --> 04:53.182
Well, it's been known to happen.

04:53.206 --> 04:55.504
Of course,
you'd have to be in a relationship first.

04:56.634 --> 04:57.773
Was that aimed at me?

04:57.797 --> 05:01.279
No, I'm just busting your... chops.

05:01.303 --> 05:04.568
Chops. You know, how...
Like partners do.

05:04.592 --> 05:06.072
- You're not my partner.
- Right.

05:06.096 --> 05:08.226
- Don't make me get the muzzle.
- Cool.

05:40.721 --> 05:42.855
NCIS. Put your hands up.

05:42.879 --> 05:45.215
You got this all wrong.

05:47.144 --> 05:48.342
Stop!

05:58.656 --> 05:59.711
Nice tackle, Urlacher.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.659
- Nate, a little help.
- Let me go.

06:03.410 --> 06:05.533
Yeah, we don't usually cuff
the suspect's feet.

06:05.955 --> 06:07.864
- Right.
- Unh, get off me.

06:08.165 --> 06:10.015
- Come on, stop... You okay?
- Unh.

06:10.039 --> 06:12.012
- Yeah.
- Let me go.

06:12.036 --> 06:14.453
Why did you run?
What'd you put in here, huh?

06:16.257 --> 06:18.024
Looks like about 2 ounces of meth.

06:18.048 --> 06:19.759
That's why he ran so fast.

06:20.303 --> 06:22.212
But not fast enough.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.270
- What do we have?
- We caught...

06:39.294 --> 06:40.601
He busted into Calvin Lee's,

06:40.625 --> 06:43.098
pinched like 2, 3 ounces of ice,
then booked out of there.

06:43.122 --> 06:46.253
We chased him down,
slapped some cuffs on him.

06:47.220 --> 06:49.734
Kensi tackled him.
I backed her up, ahem.

06:49.758 --> 06:52.232
- Slow down, Serpico.
- Did you question him?

06:52.256 --> 06:54.486
No. Figured we'd let him stew
for a little while.

06:54.510 --> 06:57.414
And, um, I think it might be better
if it wasn't me.

06:57.438 --> 06:59.788
- I'll question him.
- I'll question him.

06:59.812 --> 07:03.566
You do some
deep breathing exercises.

07:06.281 --> 07:07.479
You ever see her run?

07:09.326 --> 07:11.817
She took him down
like a cheetah on a springbok.

07:12.162 --> 07:13.277
A springbok?

07:13.872 --> 07:15.223
I'll see you later.

07:15.247 --> 07:17.016
We, uh, hitting the streets?

07:17.040 --> 07:18.644
No, I'm taking you back to Ops.

07:18.668 --> 07:20.460
I'll drive.

07:21.255 --> 07:22.334
I don't think so.

07:26.176 --> 07:27.694
There's a couple ways
we can do this.

07:27.718 --> 07:29.594
I'd like access to a JAG lawyer.

07:31.723 --> 07:34.903
- Why do you think you need a lawyer?
- I know my rights.

07:34.927 --> 07:36.241
All right, I'll ask around.

07:36.265 --> 07:39.829
I'll find out who has the best
track record for murder cases.

07:39.853 --> 07:41.269
I didn't kill anybody.

07:41.650 --> 07:42.658
So, what?

07:42.682 --> 07:44.413
You were Calvin Lee's meth dealer?

07:44.437 --> 07:47.815
You took 2 ounces of meth
from his house.

07:49.867 --> 07:51.575
All right, look, pal.

07:52.369 --> 07:55.121
We've got 60 open cases
on our desks right now.

07:55.664 --> 07:58.701
We've got a dead body,
illegal drugs and you.

07:59.669 --> 08:01.875
Easiest thing for us to do
is just walk away.

08:02.421 --> 08:03.856
But if you want us to keep digging

08:03.880 --> 08:07.144
and find something that might
prove you innocent along the way,

08:07.168 --> 08:09.751
you gotta give us a reason
to keep looking.

08:15.351 --> 08:17.783
Calvin got a promotion
to lieutenant commander,

08:17.807 --> 08:19.912
then a great billet as an XO.

08:19.936 --> 08:22.869
So let me guess.
You were next in line?

08:22.893 --> 08:24.562
It was a career-maker.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.290
Calvin was a jerk.

08:26.314 --> 08:28.279
He was moody, curt, secretive.

08:28.656 --> 08:30.175
That job was mine.

08:30.199 --> 08:32.573
My men worked their asses off
for me.

08:34.328 --> 08:37.508
For the past week, I've been spiking
his soda with methamphetamines.

08:37.532 --> 08:39.035
Just small amounts.

08:40.460 --> 08:42.085
So, what, he'd fail a drug test?

08:44.339 --> 08:45.667
You can't taste it.

08:46.258 --> 08:48.713
It feels like a caffeine high.

08:49.302 --> 08:51.401
With a big tour,
they do a drug test of the crew.

08:51.425 --> 08:53.980
Between a urinalysis and a search,

08:54.004 --> 08:56.732
I figured he'd get bumped off the boat,
the job would go to me.

08:56.756 --> 08:58.738
But you didn't count on him
killing himself.

08:58.762 --> 09:02.531
I didn't like Calvin,
but I didn't want him dead.

09:02.555 --> 09:05.116
And now there's an investigation?

09:05.140 --> 09:07.477
I went there
to undo some of the damage.

09:07.821 --> 09:10.751
No. You went back to cover
your ass.

09:10.775 --> 09:13.820
Unfortunately for you,
it was too late.

09:14.036 --> 09:17.072
Now Calvin Lee is dead,
because of you.

09:20.209 --> 09:22.972
Okay, trace amounts of blood
on his left shoe.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.554
Preliminary tox screen just came in.

09:25.578 --> 09:28.057
Looks like he was positive
for methamphetamines.

09:28.081 --> 09:31.189
But Calvin Lee
did not blow a drug test.

09:31.213 --> 09:33.521
In fact, he hasn't had urinalysis
in some time.

09:33.545 --> 09:37.032
Nobody but his shipmate, Vic, knew
he had amphetamines in his system.

09:37.056 --> 09:40.238
And if Vic's telling the truth,
Calvin Lee didn't know.

09:40.262 --> 09:42.038
Probably not why he offed himself.

09:42.062 --> 09:45.125
Nothing in his medical file
about depression or mental illness.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.417
So we could be looking at a murder.

09:47.441 --> 09:49.545
What are the chances
this isn't a suicide?

09:49.569 --> 09:51.126
I'd say 0 percent.

09:51.150 --> 09:52.877
What do you know that we don't?

09:52.901 --> 09:55.401
The words to every TV theme song.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.954
And this.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.677
Caltrans traffic operator saw him
on the bridge

10:02.701 --> 10:04.846
and zoomed in for a closer look.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.288
It's definitely Calvin Lee.

10:07.632 --> 10:09.019
And he's alone.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.399
The body language
says no signs of duress.

10:11.423 --> 10:14.216
He came with the noose already tied.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.617
I'd say that's pretty conclusive.

10:20.641 --> 10:23.220
What was that
he threw off the bridge?

10:33.742 --> 10:35.236
Maybe he was throwing
his gum out.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.213
Yeah, because you wouldn't wanna
choke on your gum

10:38.237 --> 10:39.883
before you strangle yourself
to death.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.908
- I don't know.
- Clearly.

10:43.126 --> 10:44.217
- Kensi.
- Yeah?

10:44.241 --> 10:46.222
Can you pay Calvin Lee's
parents a visit?

10:46.246 --> 10:48.628
Sam and I are going back
to the crime scene.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.430
Do...?

11:02.646 --> 11:04.366
Have fun, guys.

11:04.390 --> 11:05.916
Okay.

11:05.940 --> 11:07.578
Should I get a gun?

11:07.602 --> 11:09.330
- Have you ever carried a weapon?
- No.

11:09.354 --> 11:10.583
Fired a weapon?
Trained with weapon?

11:10.607 --> 11:12.795
- Uh, no.
- Then you probably won't need one.

11:12.819 --> 11:15.718
And the parents will be mourning
over their dead son.

11:15.742 --> 11:19.468
Which is why you're bringing
an operational psychologist with you.

11:19.492 --> 11:21.206
Copy that.

11:23.626 --> 11:26.271
We're very sorry for your loss,
Mr. And Mrs. Lee.

11:26.295 --> 11:29.807
Did Calvin ever share with you
any trouble he was having at work,

11:29.831 --> 11:33.174
in relationships?

11:33.594 --> 11:35.053
- Was he depressed?
- No, no, no.

11:35.638 --> 11:37.298
Calvin was a perfect son.

11:38.015 --> 11:39.450
Always.

11:39.474 --> 11:43.283
School, Navy, he...

11:43.307 --> 11:46.599
He was always trying to do his best.

11:46.983 --> 11:50.791
We gave up everything to come here
and have our son.

11:50.815 --> 11:53.822
And now he's gone.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.319
You left China?

11:55.658 --> 11:58.743
We had a daughter
when Ming was pregnant.

11:59.162 --> 12:01.285
But we were only allowed one child.

12:01.623 --> 12:03.307
Was your daughter close
with Calvin?

12:03.331 --> 12:06.227
When they were younger.
But she's...

12:06.251 --> 12:09.041
She's gone.
She died a long time ago.

12:09.756 --> 12:12.164
We're very sorry to hear that.

12:14.427 --> 12:17.428
Can you think of any reason why
Calvin would take his own life?

12:17.847 --> 12:21.014
- It must be a mistake.
- Tell me something.

12:23.311 --> 12:24.426
Is this your daughter?

12:25.355 --> 12:29.898
No, this is Xue-Li, our son's fiancée.

12:31.028 --> 12:33.625
- You know where we could find her?
- Well, she's very upset.

12:33.649 --> 12:35.340
She said she's going back
to Hong Kong

12:35.364 --> 12:37.359
to be with her family,
leaving immediately.

12:43.707 --> 12:45.972
Perhaps we can have
this conversation a little later.

12:45.996 --> 12:47.959
My wife and I, we...

12:48.837 --> 12:51.922
- We need more time.
- Absolutely. We understand.

12:53.175 --> 12:54.396
Maybe we're overthinking this.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.728
You know, maybe his death
doesn't have anything to do

12:56.752 --> 12:58.068
with the sub's decoy system.

12:58.092 --> 13:00.221
Maybe he just got in a fight
with his girlfriend.

13:00.724 --> 13:03.298
- Selfish.
- What's that?

13:03.602 --> 13:05.286
Suicide.

13:05.310 --> 13:08.955
You're basically leaving everybody else
to clean up your mess.

13:08.979 --> 13:10.620
You all right, big guy?

13:10.644 --> 13:12.169
You know what today is?

13:12.193 --> 13:13.368
Wednesday.

13:13.392 --> 13:14.650
It's Tuesday.

13:15.072 --> 13:16.329
You sure?

13:16.353 --> 13:18.406
Feels like a Wednesday.

13:19.118 --> 13:21.656
Five weeks to the day since
Dom went missing.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.454
And we're here
picking through roadside trash,

13:24.749 --> 13:27.180
because some distraught meatball
offed himself.

13:27.204 --> 13:30.307
Sam, if we had something new
to go on,

13:30.331 --> 13:31.726
anything new, anything at all,

13:31.750 --> 13:34.437
we'd be on it 24/7. You know that.
But we've got nothing.

13:34.461 --> 13:37.362
It's gonna stay that way as long as
we're out here wasting our time

13:37.386 --> 13:39.902
- with this sort of thing.
- This isn't a waste of time.

13:39.926 --> 13:43.988
Security of the men and the technology
in that submarine remain in question.

13:44.012 --> 13:46.890
And besides that,
Calvin Lee has a family.

13:48.189 --> 13:50.372
At the very least,
we're gonna give them closure.

13:50.396 --> 13:53.852
That's the same thing we're gonna do
for Dom's family someday.

13:57.365 --> 14:00.793
Ming and Jun Lee immigrated
here in February of 1979

14:00.817 --> 14:04.386
with their daughter, Jane.
She was 2 years old at the time.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.593
Calvin, their son,
was born six months later at County.

14:07.617 --> 14:11.517
They've been running the same antique
store in Chinatown for over 30 years.

14:11.541 --> 14:14.085
- When did the daughter pass away?
- She didn't.

14:14.633 --> 14:16.732
The parents said
she died years ago.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.334
No death certificate on record,
but I did find this.

14:21.515 --> 14:25.987
Jane Lipsger, formerly Jane Lee,
now living in the Arts District,

14:26.011 --> 14:28.997
where she owns her own eclectic,
hard metal furniture shop.

14:29.021 --> 14:32.700
- She got married?
- Nope, just changed her name.

14:32.724 --> 14:33.957
Why would the parents lie?

14:33.981 --> 14:36.026
Why would she change her name
to Lipsger?

14:37.156 --> 14:39.777
I think it's time somebody asked her.

14:40.075 --> 14:42.542
Whatever it was,
it meant something to him.

14:42.566 --> 14:45.283
And he didn't want it found
on his body.

14:47.249 --> 14:48.933
What are the circumstances
that leads

14:48.957 --> 14:52.056
to someone throwing a toilet seat
out of a moving vehicle?

14:52.080 --> 14:54.876
Kind of stretches the imagination,
don't it?

14:56.175 --> 15:00.231
All right, Christmas lights, Cats CD.
Oh, this is interesting.

15:00.255 --> 15:03.774
I may actually take this one back
and dust for prints,

15:03.798 --> 15:06.051
just out of curiosity.

15:06.435 --> 15:10.101
Oh, I do not wanna meet
the owner of this shoe.

15:11.315 --> 15:12.786
It's a size 15.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.142
- That's a lot of woman.
- Maybe.

15:19.073 --> 15:20.733
Hello.

15:24.621 --> 15:26.993
Right place, right size.

15:30.043 --> 15:32.142
That's his parting shot to the world?

15:32.166 --> 15:34.685
I'm gonna throw away my keys,
so no one can move my car?

15:34.709 --> 15:37.253
Like I said, selfish.

15:40.512 --> 15:42.006
Callen.

15:42.973 --> 15:44.052
Yeah, we're on it.

15:44.391 --> 15:46.716
Eric just found Calvin Lee's sister
in the Arts District.

15:52.649 --> 15:55.330
You know what
I like about metal furniture?

15:55.354 --> 15:56.666
Who are you kidding, G, huh?

15:56.690 --> 15:58.439
What do you know about
designing furniture?

15:58.739 --> 16:00.339
I dabble in things.

16:00.363 --> 16:02.714
You do things. You break things.

16:02.738 --> 16:05.531
You don't dabble in things.

16:06.371 --> 16:07.996
- You don't.
- Can I help you?

16:08.790 --> 16:13.096
Well, that depends.
If you're Jane Lipsger or Lee.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.551
And you are?

16:14.575 --> 16:17.685
I'm Callen. This is Sam.
We're with NCIS.

16:17.709 --> 16:19.270
Which means what exactly?

16:19.294 --> 16:22.065
Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

16:22.089 --> 16:25.275
We'd like to ask you some questions
about your brother Calvin.

16:25.299 --> 16:26.481
What about him?

16:26.505 --> 16:28.890
When was the last time
you spoke with him?

16:29.228 --> 16:30.806
Why? What's going on?

16:35.067 --> 16:37.143
I'm afraid he died early this morning.

16:44.368 --> 16:46.195
I'm sorry we had to be the ones
to tell you.

16:47.997 --> 16:49.076
How?

16:53.127 --> 16:55.583
It appears he took his own life.

17:11.553 --> 17:13.486
Calvin called me last night.

17:13.510 --> 17:15.222
Left a message on my machine.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.452
He sounded drunk,
which wasn't like him.

17:18.476 --> 17:19.651
He was saying goodbye,

17:19.675 --> 17:22.012
but I figured it was just because
he was shipping out.

17:22.481 --> 17:23.595
You two were close?

17:24.273 --> 17:26.563
We talked almost every day.

17:28.069 --> 17:29.623
Even if I hate my parents,

17:29.647 --> 17:31.779
I have an irrational need
to hear how they are.

17:33.951 --> 17:36.109
I make fun of him,

17:36.954 --> 17:39.243
but he's really a great brother.

17:40.249 --> 17:43.142
He was the good son,
you were the rebel.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.245
I was a terror.

17:45.754 --> 17:47.498
But they had it coming.

17:48.048 --> 17:51.215
Old-school Chinese parents
live for their sons.

17:52.470 --> 17:54.343
Mine were a jihua family.

17:55.139 --> 17:58.531
We left China,
because of jihua shengyu zhengce.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.304
The one-child policy.

18:02.146 --> 18:05.064
I think they resented leaving.

18:06.108 --> 18:08.066
And then
they only had eyes for him.

18:10.780 --> 18:13.069
You know what
they call baby girls in China?

18:19.122 --> 18:21.079
Maggots in rice.

18:23.334 --> 18:28.080
Do you have any idea why
Calvin would have killed himself?

18:28.798 --> 18:30.019
No.

18:30.043 --> 18:31.627
He seemed to have it all.

18:31.968 --> 18:36.048
A lieutenant commander, XO,

18:36.264 --> 18:38.553
beautiful fiancée.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.381
Fiancée?

18:46.518 --> 18:48.933
Xue-Li. That's a joke.

18:49.778 --> 18:51.663
Arranged marriage,
parents trying to force him.

18:51.687 --> 18:54.757
He wanted nothing to do with her,
trust me.

18:54.781 --> 18:56.492
Why is that?

18:59.204 --> 19:04.115
Because Calvin didn't like girls.

19:06.837 --> 19:08.082
Women.

19:09.423 --> 19:12.898
He liked men. He was very discreet.
My parents had no idea.

19:12.922 --> 19:14.729
He was in a relationship.

19:14.753 --> 19:16.612
His name's Jaxson.

19:16.636 --> 19:18.323
It wasn't easy.

19:18.347 --> 19:21.825
Calvin took the don't-ask-don't-tell stuff
very seriously.

19:21.849 --> 19:25.602
And Jaxson really didn't.

19:26.690 --> 19:29.477
There were a lot of ups
and a lot of downs.

19:33.197 --> 19:36.151
The gay lieutenant commander.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.950
Think his mom knew?

19:39.495 --> 19:42.330
- Don't moms know these things?
- You tell me.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.718
- No mom.
- That's why you need me.

19:44.742 --> 19:47.124
This looks funny.

19:48.963 --> 19:50.706
Mr. Jaxson?

19:54.385 --> 19:57.552
Mr. Jaxson? You there?

19:59.640 --> 20:01.467
You around?

20:07.106 --> 20:08.138
Sam.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.403
Doesn't look like love to me.

20:23.081 --> 20:25.868
- They find the weapon?
- Not yet.

20:26.334 --> 20:27.935
None of the neighbours
heard anything.

20:27.959 --> 20:30.370
Well, they seldom do.

20:30.797 --> 20:31.995
No signs of forced entry.

20:35.260 --> 20:36.778
Only one set of footprints.

20:36.802 --> 20:40.280
It's probably the blood found on
Lieutenant Commander Lee's shoes.

20:40.304 --> 20:43.095
So I'm thinking
he slits the guy's throat,

20:43.477 --> 20:46.513
tosses a few back,
realising what he's done,

20:47.898 --> 20:49.831
then hangs himself at first light.

20:49.855 --> 20:53.287
So we call it crime of passion?
Murder-suicide?

20:53.311 --> 20:56.036
If he killed this guy,
it explains why he hanged himself.

20:56.060 --> 20:58.671
Well, it explains the suicide.

20:58.695 --> 21:01.132
Now we gotta figure out the murder.

21:01.156 --> 21:04.009
The coroner's report confirms
the presence of methamphetamines

21:04.033 --> 21:07.349
in Calvin Lee's system,
but no signs of actual meth use.

21:07.373 --> 21:10.224
Needle marks, meth mouth,
lung damage.

21:10.248 --> 21:12.354
Which is consistent
with his shipmate's story.

21:12.378 --> 21:14.600
Main cause of suicide
in the armed services:

21:14.624 --> 21:16.733
Clinical depression,
relationship problems,

21:16.757 --> 21:18.279
deployment or combat stress.

21:18.303 --> 21:20.735
There's not much combat stress
on a sub deployment.

21:20.759 --> 21:22.070
And no history of depression.

21:22.094 --> 21:23.321
Which leaves relationship.

21:23.345 --> 21:26.578
And, uh, this guy was hiding
his relationship from a lot of people.

21:26.602 --> 21:29.320
This is the surveillance footage
from Jaxson's building.

21:29.344 --> 21:30.828
Calvin let himself in last night

21:30.852 --> 21:33.373
and then left in a hurry
eight minutes later.

21:33.397 --> 21:35.585
That's enough time to kill Jaxson.

21:35.609 --> 21:38.294
- Motive?
- Any number of reasons.

21:38.318 --> 21:39.842
If Jaxson wasn't discreet,

21:39.866 --> 21:42.442
that would put Calvin's career
and family ties on the line.

21:43.651 --> 21:46.972
Or maybe Calvin just wanted out,
you know?

21:46.996 --> 21:50.262
He's about to deploy.
He thinks it's best to just end it.

21:50.286 --> 21:53.272
Jaxson refuses to let him go
and threatens to out Calvin.

21:53.296 --> 21:55.018
But still no murder weapon.

21:55.042 --> 21:57.766
- Maybe he took it with him?
- He would've had to drop his weapon

21:57.790 --> 22:00.092
somewhere between the crime scene
and the overpass.

22:00.513 --> 22:02.672
But look at what he's wearing.
He didn't change.

22:03.057 --> 22:04.528
You saw that blood spatter.

22:04.552 --> 22:07.822
How could he manage to kill this guy
and get the knife out of the building

22:07.846 --> 22:09.621
without getting blood on himself?

22:09.645 --> 22:11.059
Eric, scroll back.

22:11.566 --> 22:14.294
It's 6:00 at night.
People are coming and going.

22:14.318 --> 22:16.728
Dog-walking time.

22:19.074 --> 22:20.710
Busy apartment building.

22:20.734 --> 22:22.130
Go back to the delivery guy.

22:22.154 --> 22:25.411
Gotta get past
all the nosey neighbours.

22:27.374 --> 22:28.572
No one buzzed him in.

22:29.751 --> 22:32.159
And he leaves in a hurry.
Can barely see his face.

22:32.462 --> 22:34.420
Purposely exits away from camera.

22:35.215 --> 22:36.590
That's our guy.

22:37.259 --> 22:38.422
Let's check it out.

22:48.062 --> 22:50.873
No one had Chinese food
delivery last night.

22:50.897 --> 22:53.164
That's because
it never got delivered.

22:53.188 --> 22:55.932
He just needed this to get access
to the apartment building.

22:56.820 --> 22:58.836
Jolly Chan's Chinese Food.

22:58.860 --> 23:01.403
Well, it's guaranteed MSG-free.

23:01.742 --> 23:03.212
Jolly Chan's is in Chinatown.

23:03.236 --> 23:05.593
And while they have
an excellent Kung Pao chicken,

23:05.617 --> 23:08.848
they don't deliver to West Hollywood
or anywhere near Jaxson's apartment.

23:08.872 --> 23:10.393
Okay.

23:10.417 --> 23:14.095
If the person who ordered the food
used a credit card,

23:14.119 --> 23:17.772
we might be able to get a name
by matching the contents of the order

23:17.796 --> 23:20.719
to the restaurant's takeout receipts.

23:21.596 --> 23:23.220
We've created a monster.

23:23.764 --> 23:26.090
What?
That's not good detective work?

23:27.393 --> 23:29.278
You might wanna start by
checking the bag

23:29.302 --> 23:31.056
and its contents for fingerprints.

23:32.231 --> 23:33.951
Sure, we could do that.

23:33.975 --> 23:37.376
Which we did. Bobby Tang.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.788
He runs an import-export company
out of West Adams.

23:39.812 --> 23:43.193
And he's got a mugshot.

23:44.577 --> 23:46.404
Emphasis on mug.

23:46.746 --> 23:48.596
He's a member
of the Asian gang Hiragana.

23:48.620 --> 23:51.553
They're one of the most dangerous
and organised gangs in L.A.

23:51.577 --> 23:53.221
Suspected homicide.

23:53.245 --> 23:57.808
Torching a business associate's store
with the business associate still in it.

23:57.832 --> 24:00.605
I'd say he possesses
the necessary skill set.

24:00.629 --> 24:02.047
Let's pay him a visit.

24:08.852 --> 24:11.260
- Hetty, can I ask you a...?
- No.

24:12.397 --> 24:14.496
You didn't even know what
I was gonna ask.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.972
Will it cost me money?

24:16.985 --> 24:18.159
Uh, I don't think so.

24:18.183 --> 24:20.377
Does it involve any legal issues?

24:20.401 --> 24:24.072
No, no. I just wanna ask you
a hypothetical question.

24:26.619 --> 24:28.910
- You mean like a riddle?
- Sure.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.462
Ask away.

24:30.486 --> 24:36.040
Have you ever known an operational
psychologist who became an agent?

24:51.353 --> 24:54.449
Kerwood Ames. A brilliant man.

24:54.473 --> 24:57.495
He pioneered
several profiling techniques.

24:57.519 --> 24:59.247
Wow. Uh...

24:59.271 --> 25:00.832
Is he still with the agency?

25:00.856 --> 25:04.007
No, he was killed in his second week
on the job.

25:04.031 --> 25:05.824
Or was it his second day?

25:07.442 --> 25:12.081
Ames had a gifted mind,
but he tended to think logically.

25:13.167 --> 25:17.307
Invaluable for a scientist,
not so much for an agent.

25:17.331 --> 25:19.723
Choices they make on the street

25:19.747 --> 25:23.435
don't always seem to make sense
to the untrained eye,

25:23.459 --> 25:25.843
which is probably
what keeps them alive.

25:26.431 --> 25:27.925
Why do you ask?

25:28.474 --> 25:31.570
Oh, just curious.

25:31.594 --> 25:33.892
Admirable quality, curiosity.

25:35.398 --> 25:37.854
Unless, of course, you're a cat.

25:44.824 --> 25:48.193
So this is Bobby Tang's company.

25:51.832 --> 25:53.871
You bring the lock pick?

25:58.547 --> 26:00.255
That works.

26:13.562 --> 26:16.492
Looks like our buddy, Bobby Tang,
is a video pirate.

26:16.516 --> 26:19.204
- No.
- What?

26:19.228 --> 26:22.071
I know what you're gonna say.
Don't say it.

26:24.114 --> 26:26.154
- You don't like my pirate impression?
- Ha, ha.

26:47.471 --> 26:50.045
I guess Xue-Li didn't go back
to Hong Kong after all.

26:52.059 --> 26:53.695
What's she doing with Bobby Tang?

26:53.719 --> 26:56.183
I don't know,
but she looks like she's in trouble.

27:02.653 --> 27:03.934
Look out!

27:08.534 --> 27:10.860
Throw your weapon down!
Drop! Down!

27:11.204 --> 27:13.243
Drop your weapon!
Down on the ground!

27:13.873 --> 27:15.332
Get down!

27:45.697 --> 27:47.132
- You okay?
- Yeah.

27:47.156 --> 27:50.775
- Where'd they come from?
- And where'd she go?

28:01.729 --> 28:03.578
That guy got me in the face.

28:03.602 --> 28:06.583
And I'm not even gonna tell you
where the guy upstairs got me.

28:06.607 --> 28:08.376
I think the guy in the hospital bit me.

28:08.400 --> 28:12.756
I see the, uh, Ice and Aspirin Club
is at it again.

28:12.780 --> 28:14.418
Every time I come here,

28:14.442 --> 28:18.199
I feel like I've stepped
into a damn Hardy Boys novel.

28:19.163 --> 28:22.497
I gather that, uh, you couldn't talk
your way out of this one.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.809
Yeah, we had a little bit
of a language barrier.

28:25.833 --> 28:28.292
And an I-want-you-dead barrier.

28:31.759 --> 28:37.074
That, uh, knife we got off Bobby Tang,
Forensics says it looks like a match

28:37.098 --> 28:40.277
with the one that killed Calvin Lee's
boyfriend Jaxson.

28:40.301 --> 28:42.611
- And Xue-Li?
- In the wind.

28:42.635 --> 28:45.409
I alerted Border Patrol
and local law enforcement.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.492
And what have we learned from
the three stooges

28:47.516 --> 28:49.103
you took into custody?

28:49.819 --> 28:51.622
We're not really sure
they speak English.

28:51.646 --> 28:54.656
Well, leave that to me.

29:00.997 --> 29:02.551
- What's that mean?
- It means

29:02.575 --> 29:05.240
we have ways of making them talk.

29:08.755 --> 29:10.878
You're next, Mr. Callen.

29:12.842 --> 29:14.478
Still don't know
what we're dealing with.

29:14.502 --> 29:17.169
Could be espionage.
Could be anything.

29:18.014 --> 29:19.473
So, what do we have, Kensi?

29:20.225 --> 29:21.660
Okay.

29:21.684 --> 29:25.244
Bobby Tang delivers Chinese food
to West Hollywood and kills Jaxson.

29:25.268 --> 29:28.369
Calvin finds Jaxson's body,
hangs himself.

29:28.393 --> 29:32.541
Bobby confronts Xue-Li
who two-taps him in the chest.

29:32.565 --> 29:35.039
Xue-Li's the only one still alive.
What do we have on her?

29:35.063 --> 29:37.862
Supposedly she was brought here
as part of an arranged marriage.

29:38.660 --> 29:39.668
From where?

29:39.692 --> 29:42.882
She's not exactly a well-behaved
mail-order bride.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.801
She handled that Glock
like a professional.

29:44.825 --> 29:47.289
I can speak to the parents,
find out how they met her.

29:47.711 --> 29:50.416
Maybe they know something
they don't realise they know.

29:55.427 --> 29:56.542
Would you like to come?

29:57.805 --> 29:59.690
- Do you want me to?
- You don't want to be out?

29:59.714 --> 30:01.989
No. No, I do. I do.

30:02.013 --> 30:03.785
L... I should stay.

30:03.809 --> 30:08.497
I got a lot of paperwork, logical stuff.

30:08.521 --> 30:11.608
Kerwood Ames-îsh.

30:14.447 --> 30:15.858
What are we missing, Sam?

30:17.116 --> 30:19.156
I don't know.

30:29.087 --> 30:31.163
What do you think Dom would say?

30:32.674 --> 30:37.632
Probably give us some obscure
historical fact about God knows what.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.570
"Did you know Leonardo da Vinci
was the first person

30:41.594 --> 30:45.158
to design the submarine
in the 15th century?

30:45.182 --> 30:49.872
And he was also the first inventor
to think to combine existing machines

30:49.896 --> 30:53.435
to create new and improved ones."

30:59.618 --> 31:02.073
How do we know this is just a key?

31:13.632 --> 31:16.692
Mrs. Lee, I'm very sorry to bother you,
but we have a few more questions.

31:16.716 --> 31:17.976
Jun is not here.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.503
That's okay. I'm sure you can help.

31:21.306 --> 31:23.608
I prefer my husband to be here.

31:23.632 --> 31:25.351
Why?

31:25.727 --> 31:27.138
He's the strong one.

31:28.439 --> 31:31.166
You said Calvin's fiancée Xue-Li
went back to Hong Kong.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.896
- Yes.
- But she didn't.

31:34.361 --> 31:35.939
Did she?

31:40.200 --> 31:43.177
You need to wait for my husband.
I can't talk about it.

31:43.201 --> 31:46.241
Because you don't want to
or because he won't let you?

31:50.294 --> 31:55.122
Okay, I don't usually get this excited,
but this is cool on so many levels.

31:55.424 --> 31:56.835
I take it it's not a car key.

31:58.719 --> 32:00.759
It is and so much more.

32:01.264 --> 32:02.734
It's a high-tech cloner.

32:02.758 --> 32:07.036
It's like an IronClad flash drive,
just jacked up on steroids.

32:07.060 --> 32:09.351
It only needs to be in the vicinity
of a computer.

32:09.647 --> 32:11.770
And it relays the information
to a remote location.

32:11.983 --> 32:15.494
Look at this thing. You can disguise
this as any everyday object.

32:15.518 --> 32:20.132
Just leave it near someone's computer
and all her secrets are revealed.

32:20.156 --> 32:22.697
This one, interestingly enough,
never been used.

32:23.161 --> 32:25.996
Why would the Navy give Calvin
a jacked-up IronClad?

32:26.456 --> 32:27.950
I don't think they did.

32:28.416 --> 32:31.678
I mean, I can't be totally sure
of how any of this works,

32:31.702 --> 32:35.876
because most of the code
looks like this.

32:36.424 --> 32:39.769
- Chinese.
- Military grade.

32:39.793 --> 32:42.650
Nothing this sophisticated is
even on our radar.

32:42.674 --> 32:44.531
So if this came
from the People's Republic

32:44.555 --> 32:46.360
and wound up on that sub...

32:46.384 --> 32:48.078
Every piece of classified information

32:48.102 --> 32:51.970
and new technology on that mission
would be compromised.

32:52.566 --> 32:55.139
And available to our enemies.

32:56.236 --> 32:58.229
Calvin Lee was a Chinese spy.

33:09.999 --> 33:16.891
Calvin's shipmate, Vic, did say that
he was secretive, nervous, a loner.

33:16.915 --> 33:19.142
I would be, too,
if I were betraying my country.

33:19.166 --> 33:21.987
Imagine living every day wondering
if you were about to be caught,

33:22.011 --> 33:24.277
constantly looking over
your shoulder.

33:24.301 --> 33:26.595
Yeah, imagine that.

33:29.143 --> 33:31.159
Maybe he thought
he was about to be made.

33:31.183 --> 33:32.908
Could explain the suicide.

33:32.932 --> 33:35.074
Yeah, but why toss this?

33:35.098 --> 33:38.086
Why not hide it first
or give it to your handlers?

33:38.110 --> 33:43.379
Maybe the lieutenant commander
is sending a message from the grave.

33:43.403 --> 33:46.836
Historically,
traitors were hung from bridges

33:46.860 --> 33:49.883
- as a warning to others.
- Calvin didn't wanna be a traitor.

33:49.907 --> 33:52.015
That's why the cloner had
never been used.

33:52.039 --> 33:53.216
Because Calvin refused.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.181
So the Chinese threatened him
with the best currency they had.

33:56.205 --> 33:59.974
His one vulnerability,
his boyfriend, Jaxson.

33:59.998 --> 34:02.642
Only Bobby Tang went too far.
He killed him.

34:02.666 --> 34:03.983
So with nowhere else to turn,

34:04.007 --> 34:06.931
his suicide is a final act of defiance
against his tormentors.

34:07.307 --> 34:09.027
That explains why he tossed this.

34:09.051 --> 34:13.828
- So maybe Mr. Lee was a true patriot.
- Died for his country.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.786
With the operation blown,
the only thing left to do for his handlers

34:16.810 --> 34:18.833
was clean up the mess
and cover your tracks,

34:18.858 --> 34:20.581
starting with Bobby Tang.

34:20.605 --> 34:23.460
Xue-Li,
pretending to be his arranged bride,

34:23.484 --> 34:28.045
but really a pro brought in from
the home office to get things done.

34:28.070 --> 34:30.261
Well, that's why
we have no back-story on her.

34:30.284 --> 34:33.967
She's a shooter.
Now she's tying up her loose ends.

34:33.991 --> 34:36.350
- Which are?
- Anyone who may have known.

34:36.373 --> 34:38.478
Probably starting with the family.

34:38.502 --> 34:40.522
And any one of them could
be an asset to us.

34:40.545 --> 34:43.088
So they're all in danger.

34:45.972 --> 34:47.228
How did you meet Xue-Li?

34:47.252 --> 34:48.732
Our family was friends of Xue-Li's...

34:49.850 --> 34:52.114
I'm sorry. Excuse me. Yeah?

34:52.139 --> 34:53.782
Get Calvin's parents out of there.

34:53.806 --> 34:57.313
Callen and Sam think
that Xue-Li's gonna try to kill them.

34:58.234 --> 34:59.918
Okay, got it.

34:59.942 --> 35:02.792
- I need to get you out now.
- To go where? We have customers.

35:02.816 --> 35:05.919
You are in danger. I need to move you
and your wife someplace safe.

35:05.943 --> 35:09.094
This is our store, our neighbourhood.
There is no danger.

35:09.118 --> 35:11.836
Xue-Li might come here to kill you.
Let's go out the back door.

35:11.860 --> 35:14.163
- I need to lock up.
- We don't have time for this.

35:20.298 --> 35:21.353
I got it. I got it.

35:21.377 --> 35:23.092
Sorry, I have to do this.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.258
Jun, no! No, Jun, stop!

35:40.819 --> 35:42.953
Eric,
Jun just tried to kill me and his wife.

35:42.977 --> 35:46.085
- I need backup.
- I'm calling L.A.P.D.

35:46.109 --> 35:47.991
And sending your GPS
to Callen and Sam.

35:54.750 --> 35:58.035
Eric, Xue-Li's after us.
Where's our backup?

36:03.759 --> 36:05.253
Kensi's in trouble.

36:12.643 --> 36:14.742
Eric, I'm in a Chinese restaurant
called Foo Chow.

36:14.766 --> 36:17.486
I need the exit strategy to get back
to my car on Broadway.

36:17.510 --> 36:19.599
I'm loading the Pictometry
of the building.

36:21.694 --> 36:23.354
Come on. Come on.

36:27.241 --> 36:29.542
Okay, I got you.
Uh, don't go out the front.

36:29.566 --> 36:32.317
Take the side door on your left.
That leads into the market.

36:47.220 --> 36:49.769
Eric, I need eyes on Jun and Xue-Li.

36:49.793 --> 36:51.171
I'm looking.

36:56.187 --> 36:57.729
I got him.

36:58.064 --> 37:00.520
Jun's at your 6 o'clock,
closing in fast.

37:09.701 --> 37:11.160
Stay down.

37:12.329 --> 37:15.033
Callen, Jun is closing in on her
and I can't locate Xue-Li.

37:18.293 --> 37:21.270
Kensi, you hear me?
We're coming in the north gate.

37:21.294 --> 37:23.171
Okay,
but you need to find these guys.

37:32.641 --> 37:34.265
I got eyes on Jun.

37:43.777 --> 37:46.291
Federal agent, Jun. Don't move.

37:46.315 --> 37:47.543
I got Jun, Sam.

37:47.567 --> 37:50.289
- Eric, where's Xue-Li?
- I can't find her.

37:50.313 --> 37:51.951
Ming says there are three of them.

37:57.791 --> 37:59.369
Kensi!

38:00.753 --> 38:02.496
Go, go, go!

38:10.429 --> 38:12.303
Don't do it, Xue-Li.

38:12.723 --> 38:13.980
We know about Calvin.

38:14.004 --> 38:16.057
We found the clone. It's over.

38:22.108 --> 38:24.409
There were several families.

38:24.433 --> 38:26.437
All agents of the MSS.

38:28.114 --> 38:31.257
We were told we'd be given the gift
of a second child

38:31.281 --> 38:35.495
if we would go to America
and raise him to be a spy.

38:36.414 --> 38:38.679
Did you resent the MSS?

38:38.703 --> 38:42.374
Our son would be the ultimate
socialist hero.

38:43.504 --> 38:44.915
We were proud.

38:45.340 --> 38:47.392
When did you tell Calvin?

38:47.416 --> 38:49.086
A very young age.

38:49.969 --> 38:51.689
He always knew.

38:51.713 --> 38:54.865
We raised him to go to Annapolis,
join the Navy.

38:54.889 --> 38:57.134
But always loyal to China.

38:58.144 --> 39:00.849
And what about Xue-Li?

39:01.189 --> 39:04.143
Sent from the MSS
to be his handler.

39:04.818 --> 39:08.353
And make sure we're still committed
to the mission.

39:09.072 --> 39:13.284
But in the end, he couldn't do it.

39:15.662 --> 39:17.655
He was such a sweet boy.

39:19.041 --> 39:21.555
We never should have made him
do this.

39:21.579 --> 39:25.749
But Jun insisted.
It was why we came here.

39:28.550 --> 39:33.378
Ming, you got a chance
to do the right thing,

39:34.056 --> 39:36.761
maybe even start over,

39:38.143 --> 39:41.726
if you tell us about the others
who might still be here.

39:44.024 --> 39:45.269
Think about it.

39:47.862 --> 39:50.068
Calvin Lee was born
to be a sleeper agent.

39:50.448 --> 39:54.030
But deep down inside,
he loved this country.

39:54.493 --> 39:56.509
Store was the perfect cover.

39:56.533 --> 39:59.005
Agents could come and go,
no questions asked.

39:59.029 --> 40:01.258
How many contacts
do we think they had?

40:01.282 --> 40:02.466
Well, it's hard to say.

40:02.490 --> 40:07.579
Eric's going through their computers,
records, security footage for months.

40:08.132 --> 40:12.130
- Hey. Ready?
- Yeah.

40:14.722 --> 40:16.264
Okay.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.854
Mom?

40:30.697 --> 40:34.042
- Mom. Mom.
- My baby.

40:34.066 --> 40:36.211
Thought it might help Ming.

40:36.235 --> 40:37.822
You know.

40:38.163 --> 40:41.080
She might tell us more
if she actually saw her daughter.

40:41.458 --> 40:43.913
Emotional witnesses
tend to open up more.

40:45.545 --> 40:48.356
You may have just blown open
an entire cell

40:48.380 --> 40:52.048
of sleeper agents
30 years in the making.

40:52.552 --> 40:55.043
You should stick
with what you do best.

40:57.682 --> 40:59.177
Carry on, everyone.

41:02.688 --> 41:05.938
- Nice work, buddy.
- Thanks.

41:06.358 --> 41:09.003
You know, you're not that bad
a partner after all.

41:09.027 --> 41:10.249
Really?

41:10.273 --> 41:13.837
Because I asked Hetty if, uh,
operational psychologists

41:13.861 --> 41:15.800
had ever become agents.

41:15.824 --> 41:17.878
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no.

41:17.902 --> 41:19.596
I'm sorry. I so take it back.

41:19.620 --> 41:22.992
I know I'm logical, but I'm also intuitive,
self-sufficient, hm?

41:25.628 --> 41:26.628
No.

41:27.254 --> 41:28.333
Cool.

41:28.714 --> 41:32.297
I get it. Absolutely cool.
