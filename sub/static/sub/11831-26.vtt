I just took a call
from Barbara Landers.

25:31.082 --> 25:33.749
She works at the Lizzie Borden
Historical Society
in Fall River.

25:33.815 --> 25:36.349
She's been
following the case.
Lizzie Borden had a cat.

25:36.415 --> 25:38.715
She killed it
by chopping off its head.

25:38.782 --> 25:41.782
It's too late for that.
<i>[ Jimmy ]</i>
<i>Yeah, probably.</i>

25:46.082 --> 25:47.949
It's time for the audible.

25:50.115 --> 25:52.249
What's the audible?

25:53.915 --> 25:56.382
We got to put
the doctor back up there
and rehabilitate him.

25:56.449 --> 25:58.449
Which is
what I've been saying.
He's sympathetic.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.582
I think the jury
still wants to like him.

26:00.649 --> 26:03.715
Yeah, but if he's
a hostile witness, Ally,
it isn't worth it.

26:06.749 --> 26:09.015
Forget it. If I get up there
again, I'll just--

26:09.082 --> 26:11.615
- Do you want
to help her or not?
- If I thought I could.

26:11.682 --> 26:15.382
You might. There's nothing
to lose. Maybe there was
a couple of days ago, but now--

26:15.449 --> 26:17.615
Meaning what?
People are laughing at me?
I'm a joke?

26:17.682 --> 26:21.415
If I thought that, would I be
calling you to the stand again?
You're calling me...

26:21.482 --> 26:24.482

a pretty good job of documenting
this past life phenomena.

29:28.632 --> 29:30.965
Helen Gamble, Ally McBeal.

29:31.032 --> 29:35.865
Hi. Uh, I've been looking

29:35.932 --> 29:39.065

but they'll be coming back.

29:39.132 --> 29:42.465

- I'm wearing one.

29:47.265 --> 29:49.332
We don't like her.

29:51.432 --> 29:54.465
Doctor, you admitted
that she could have
faked all this.

29:54.532 --> 29:57.465
I said it's possible,
but I certainly don't
think she was.

29:57.532 --> 30:00.099
But let's be fair.
All the stuff she uttered
about Lizzie Borden--

30:00.165 --> 30:02.332
She could have
looked that up at a library.

30:02.399 --> 30:04.932
If a patient
were faking hypnosis,
I would see it.

30:04.999 --> 30:09.332
Now, sometimes things can be
suggested to a patient
under hypnosis, right?

30:09.399 --> 30:11.965
Certainly.
For example,

30:12.032 --> 30:13.932
if under hypnosis
you suggested to her...

30:13.999 --> 30:16.732
- all that Lizzie Borden stuff,
then we would--
- I didn't do that.

30:16.799 --> 30:19.265
[ Eugene ]
I'm speaking
rhetorically, Doctor.

30:19.332 --> 30:23.132
Now suppose you went to the
library. Suppose you looked up
all that Lizzie Borden stuff.

30:23.199 --> 30:28.465
Suppose while under hypnosis
you told her that she was
Lizzie Borden in a prior life.

30:28.532 --> 30:30.865
- Why--
- <i>Suppose you plant it</i>
<i>in her unconscious.</i>

30:30.932 --> 30:33.432
When you brought her out,
she might believe it all
as the truth.

30:33.499 --> 30:36.399
My question, Doctor--
I certainly didn't--

30:36.465 --> 30:38.865
Is that possible
using hypnotherapy?

30:38.932 --> 30:42.765
Are you suggesting
I hypnotized her
into killing her husband?

30:42.832 --> 30:45.032
Is that possible?
That's what--
<i>No, counsel, it isn't.</i>

30:45.099 --> 30:48.465
<i>You can't use hypnosis</i>
<i>to get somebody</i>
<i>to commit a murder.</i>

30:48.532 --> 30:50.665
[ Laughing ]
That's ridiculous.

30:50.732 --> 30:52.565
Any doctor
would tell you so.

30:52.632 --> 30:55.165
Doctor, where were you the
night Mark Hanson was murdered?

30:55.232 --> 30:57.999
Objection.
I'm entitled to ask
this witness questions.

[ Eugene ]
My client came to you that day.

31:05.265 --> 31:09.965
You prescribed medication.
You told her to take a full
milligram of Xanax, didn't you?

31:10.032 --> 31:11.832
She was suffering
severe anxiety.

31:11.899 --> 31:15.565
A full milligram of Xanax
would knock her out cold...

31:15.632 --> 31:18.032
- <i>for two hours, maybe three.</i>
- <i>[ Dr. Peters ]</i>
What are you saying?

31:18.099 --> 31:20.265
[ Eugene ]
I'm saying that you loved her.
That you planted...

31:20.332 --> 31:22.365
all that past life bunk
in her head.

31:22.432 --> 31:25.132
That you went to her house
while she was out,
killed her husband,

31:25.199 --> 31:28.665
knowing that when she came to,
with all that Lizzie Borden
stuff swirling in her mind,

31:28.732 --> 31:31.065
that she might think
she must have done it.

31:31.132 --> 31:35.365
- That's what I'm suggesting.
- I think you watch a little
too much television, counsel.

31:35.432 --> 31:37.799
Do I?

31:37.865 --> 31:40.465
<i>Like you say,</i>

31:40.532 --> 31:43.499
a person couldn't
do something under hypnosis...

31:43.565 --> 31:46.432
or while under a blackout
that she couldn't do
while conscious.

31:46.499 --> 31:50.365

it's not in this
woman's character...

31:50.432 --> 31:52.365
to commit
that kind of violence.

31:52.432 --> 31:56.465
Add up all the things that
you've said, Doctor. Somebody
else must have done it. Who?

31:56.532 --> 31:58.665
I don't know.

31:58.732 --> 32:00.699
She had no motive.

32:00.765 --> 32:03.199
<i>If she wanted</i>
<i>to divorce her husband,</i>
<i>she could have done that.</i>

32:03.265 --> 32:05.199
She was the one
with the money.

32:05.265 --> 32:08.932
- The only one here
with a motive is you, Doctor.
- Is he allowed to do this?

32:08.999 --> 32:11.899
- You went there
with that hatchet--
- All right. That is enough!

32:11.965 --> 32:13.932
- You killed him, didn't you?
- Counsel!

32:13.999 --> 32:17.465
-I'm not even
gonna dignify that.
-I'll ask you the same question.

32:17.532 --> 32:20.732
- Where were you
when it happened?
- Home.

33:48.799 --> 33:50.699

Because I figured you would
have a problem. I couldn't risk
you tipping off Peters.

isn't already humiliated,
he's certainly ruined now.

into your thinking?

Our thinking was
we needed something to say
in our closing argument.

We needed to be able
to get up and say
maybe somebody else did it.

34:07.765 --> 34:10.565

Peters was home alone,
we thought, why not try?

You can't say "dull ache."

Dull pain goes away.
Shooting pain is chronic.

35:02.932 --> 35:06.232
It radiates. I got it.
Let that be his word,
not yours.

35:06.299 --> 35:08.765
"Radiate" sounds
a little clinical.

All the same. Just say
"shooting pain," all right?

Criminal law is-is--

38:22.065 --> 38:24.099
I know.

38:26.732 --> 38:29.065
It's not my world.

38:31.132 --> 38:34.232
And I don't want it to be.

38:37.132 --> 38:40.632

less than just because I--

[ Mutters, Gasps ]

39:03.899 --> 39:05.999
Right in front of everybody?

39:06.065 --> 39:08.165
How did he get a gun
in a courtroom?

39:08.232 --> 39:10.065
They think he must have
bypassed the detector.

39:10.132 --> 39:13.165
He was in and out so much,
security maybe thought
he was a lawyer.

39:13.232 --> 39:15.565
Oh, my God!

Hi. Hi.

Surprise.

39:47.599 --> 39:49.465
They're beautiful.

39:53.365 --> 39:55.599
I've been missing you.
I can't stop
thinking of you.

40:03.199 --> 40:05.499

a lot about you too.

He left a note.

41:24.832 --> 41:26.899
And her?

41:26.965 --> 41:28.999
She didn't know
anything about it.

41:31.932 --> 41:35.332
Your theory
turned out to be true.

41:37.032 --> 41:39.999
[ Sighs ]
What do you know?

41:46.232 --> 41:50.032
I-I'm, um, sorry for some
of the things that I said.

41:50.099 --> 41:54.199
You haven't said anything
I haven't heard before.

41:58.332 --> 42:00.465
