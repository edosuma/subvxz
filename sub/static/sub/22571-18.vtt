WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:02.036
- All right, here we go.

00:02.136 --> 00:03.271
Do you know where you're going,
Danny?

00:03.371 --> 00:04.738
- Going to an auction.
- Okay.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.574
Do you know how to get over
to Spruce Street?

00:06.674 --> 00:08.109
- You got the thing right here.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.877
This is supposed to be
your hometown.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.479
- Yeah, but I don't know
where we're going.

00:11.579 --> 00:14.915
- Oh, my God. I'm getting you
to the auction right here.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.850
- Spruce Street.
- Thank you.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.919
1 1/4 miles,
five minutes from here.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.655
- Oh, I know where I'm going.
- Straight ahead and then--

00:21.755 --> 00:23.124
Oh, you should've turned.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.959
- I know right where I'm going.
I'm going the wrong way.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.199
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:31.299 --> 00:33.567
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:33.667 --> 00:35.069
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:35.169 --> 00:37.071
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.406
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.740
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:39.840 --> 00:41.442
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:41.542 --> 00:42.976
- You shut your face.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.146
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.314
- We're back, baby!

00:49.450 --> 00:51.785
- Casey wanted me to check in
on a locker today

00:51.885 --> 00:53.754
that I bought earlier,
but I forgot to mention

00:53.854 --> 00:55.789
I'm stopping at an auction,
which I'm not supposed to.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.292
And what she doesn't know
doesn't hurt her.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.328
Casey thinks we have
too much stuff,

01:00.428 --> 01:02.230
but I always do well
in Riverside.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.198
So I can't not go.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.699
Living on the edge.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.301
*

01:07.401 --> 01:09.470
- I don't normally go out
to Riverside,

01:09.570 --> 01:12.673
but I've heard Darrell and Rene
bragging about this facility,

01:12.773 --> 01:16.344
so sometimes when you brag,
you invite unwanted attention.

01:16.444 --> 01:19.147
And today,
I'm the unwanted attention.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.349
I'm gonna go and make sure
if there's something good,

01:21.449 --> 01:23.284
today it's mine.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.818
- This is a nice area.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.420
I saw a guy with
a big bottle of wine

01:26.520 --> 01:29.190
walking down the street.
- Yeah.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.859
- And it's the pink wine too,
so you know it's good.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.496
Just take it easy, see who's
there, see what happens?

01:35.596 --> 01:36.497
- Yeah.
- Try to blend in

01:36.597 --> 01:38.031
to the crowd and buy
something cheap?

01:38.132 --> 01:40.201
- Yeah, blend.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.336
- Jarrod and I could blend in
fine in these parts.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.638
We're party animals.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.407
- Oh, look, 40.
- Look at that guy.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.041
Riding his bike
with a 40-ouncer.

01:48.142 --> 01:51.011
- Classic Riverside.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.782
- Wow.
It's 10:00 in the morning.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.484
- Good to see you.
What's happening?

01:56.584 --> 01:58.852
- Oh, I like what you've got
going on.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.222
You're gonna be catching
the men's eyes, is what...

02:01.322 --> 02:02.690
- Entice us.
- It's mostly men here.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.858
- There's always mostly men.
It's a sausage party.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.027
Can't let them win.
We can't let them win.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.929
- We're trying to class up
the auction

02:09.029 --> 02:10.831
and represent the ladies.
- You know, we're gonna

02:10.931 --> 02:13.234
distract them with
all this Golden Girl chic.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.868
- It's always a sausage party
when we're not shopping

02:14.968 --> 02:15.969
for sausage.
- Wow.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.405
- Are we ever shopping
for sausage?

02:17.505 --> 02:18.472
- No, those days are over.
- Though, we still like

02:18.572 --> 02:19.973
eating it, right?
- Oh!

02:20.073 --> 02:22.210
- Yeah, you gotta get
your vitamins, come on now.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.644
Come on, look at this skin,
girl!

02:23.744 --> 02:26.480
- I think you were saying that
you just really don't...

02:26.580 --> 02:28.182
buy sausage anymore.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.383
- No. No.
- No. No.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.984
- You kinda got out of the
market of sausage

02:31.084 --> 02:32.820
a long time ago. I think you're
missing everything.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.655
- I like sausage.
- Yeah, but they don't.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.824
- Wait, wait, wait, we still
like sausage now.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.359
- I'm just trying to get
it all straight.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.162
I don't care if they buy
sausage or not.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.664
I just want 'em to buy lockers.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.733
- They're not the same.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.402
- You guys are!

02:48.502 --> 02:50.671
- We're trying to get Brandi
to match with us--one day.

02:50.771 --> 02:51.839
- One day--look at--

02:51.939 --> 02:53.140
this is about the closest
we're gonna get.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.075
- That's about as close
as you're gonna get.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.644
I mean, I wanted to blend in,

02:56.744 --> 02:58.078
but that is not
what I had in mind.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.747
I think my nana has
one of these.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.249
- She probably does.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.317
- Probably your nana's
right here.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.152
- All right, welcome to
the auction, boys and girls.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.620
Before you go through
these gates,

03:06.720 --> 03:08.188
you need to know the rules.
We're gonna go to the unit.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.790
We're gonna remove the locker,
gonna open the door.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.492
We're gonna give you five
minutes to take a look around.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.727
You can't go inside.
You can't open any boxes.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.463
And whoever's got the most
money in their pocket

03:15.563 --> 03:17.298
can own it today.
Are you ready?

03:17.398 --> 03:18.766
- Yep.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.734
That was really weak
and pitiful.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.035
Are you ready?
- Yep.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.804
- Thank you.
- You gotta give him a fish

03:23.904 --> 03:25.339
when he does what you tell him.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.644
- All right, folks,
through the gate.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.680
We've got all sorts of units.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.415
All right, here we go.

03:34.515 --> 03:37.050
All right now!

03:37.150 --> 03:39.152
- Uh...at least there's a
couple of boxes

03:39.253 --> 03:41.822
of trash bags so you can throw
all this  away.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.857
- This ain't it. This ain't it.
- Clean sweep.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.926
- This is not the type of room
that I heard about.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.661
- Look the whole thing is,
Casey said I wasn't supposed to

03:47.761 --> 03:49.830
go to auctions today,
so the only way I can get away

03:49.930 --> 03:51.832
with buying one,
if a killer locker comes up,

03:51.932 --> 03:53.233
and then I just be like,
"Laura called me,

03:53.334 --> 03:54.635
get your butt down here,
there's a good auction,"

03:54.735 --> 03:56.003
I got an excuse.
- There you go.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.171
- But if I buy an average
locker, I'll get stopped.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.040
What's your pleasure?

04:00.140 --> 04:01.709
And what you gonna pay?
Say it, how much money here?

04:01.809 --> 04:04.278
- Tell him, folks.
How 'bout 25

04:04.378 --> 04:06.514
Give me 10
- Come on, folks.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.215
Ten bucks, you in?

04:08.316 --> 04:09.950
- Why don't you just start
all over again.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.520
All right, folks,
I got a great unit for ya.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.523
Everyone listen up.
Here we go. We're selling it.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.057
- $1.
- I got a dollar.

04:17.157 --> 04:19.393
Thank you very much. Gonna do
a tune to thank you, babe.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.395
Sold your way.
One big dollar.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.196
- Wow!
- Big money!

04:23.297 --> 04:24.632
- Thanks for returning
my dignity.

04:24.732 --> 04:25.999
- Hey, you're very welcome.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.568
This feels like a bad omen.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.869
Let's hope the
lockers get better

04:28.969 --> 04:30.404
and we can make some money.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.172
All right, this way.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.710
Get ready, here we go!

04:36.810 --> 04:38.211
- We don't sell sofas anymore.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.881
- Coming your way at 5 bucks.
- 5 big bucks.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.751
Let's do it to it!

04:43.851 --> 04:45.486
- If you buy this to it,
the first thing you need to do,

04:45.586 --> 04:47.254
before you even clean it out,
get a tetanus shot.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.991
- Sold it your way.
5 big bucks, 5 big bucks.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.826
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.962
- Come on now, Riverside!

04:55.062 --> 04:56.964
- Is somebody actually
paying rent for that?

04:57.064 --> 04:58.599
- That is a nice one.

04:58.699 --> 04:59.900
- And if you're ready to go,
I am ready to go.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.869
- 10 by 15, folks.
- 10 by 15, folks.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.471
Start 'em in.
Where?

05:03.571 --> 05:05.606
How 'bout 2
- $2 is too much.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.140
- $100 bill. Just started
at 100.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.809
- Oh, no.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.579
- 50 bucks. 50 where, 50 now.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.280
- Shoot, I'd give you 25.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.515
I mean, what in the heck is
wrong

05:14.615 --> 05:15.783
with these folks
here today?

05:15.883 --> 05:16.950
- Yep.
- Bought it for 25.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.352
That's it. Go to the next one.
- Whoo!

05:18.452 --> 05:20.388
I have never had to work
so hard for 25 bucks.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.922
- Me neither, babe.
- Damn.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.824
- What's it gonna take to get
these buyers excited?

05:23.924 --> 05:25.826
Do I have to take my shirt off?

05:25.926 --> 05:27.828
- We can't come here and not
go home with something.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.196
- Let me see those.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.131
- This is the way to see
what they had in their pocket.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.800
They pulled out all
their money so quick.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.034
- Immediately.
- We're like, hah, money.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.268
And they pulled out
all their money.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.104
These guys always like to
show off their wads.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.506
- We just come up with
a classier,

05:38.606 --> 05:41.108
more ladylike way to o it.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.342
- So easy to get
in their pants.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.211
Too easy.
We didn't even get undressed.

05:44.311 --> 05:45.713
- Ain't nobody wants to get
in their pants.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.350
- All right, boys and girls.
I've never seen this unit,

05:50.451 --> 05:51.585
but I have a good feeling
about it.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.521
- Come on, let's go!

05:53.621 --> 05:55.423
Here we are!
- Oh, come on.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.190
*

06:03.697 --> 06:05.232
Lord A'mighty.

06:05.332 --> 06:08.402
You got a coffee table.
10 or 15 boxes.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.170
Oh, this is a little corner
table here,

06:10.270 --> 06:12.205
little corner bench.
I like those.

06:12.305 --> 06:15.208
This unit might pay for some
gas money expenses.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.711
- Rene, I got your wife
on the phone here.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.279
She wants to talk to you.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.948
Maybe if I bruise his ego
a little bit,

06:21.048 --> 06:22.315
he'll get mad
and spend some money.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.117
Does your wife always forbid
you from buying stuff?

06:24.217 --> 06:26.854
- No, she technically
doesn't ask, so.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.088
But don't worry.
I'm not buying this.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.791
Oh, because she said not to.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.359
- Number one,
I can smell it from here.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.661
That's a big problem.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.696
- Those boxes are gonna be
full of clothes

06:35.796 --> 06:38.131
and pens and lighters.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.833
- It's gonna be hard.
You wanna bet on it?

06:39.933 --> 06:41.802
- No.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.270
- Hm.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.105
Okay, this ammo can--so,
it could be full or rounds

06:45.205 --> 06:46.774
or it could be empty.
- This goes in, like,

06:46.874 --> 06:48.141
the corner of a kitchen.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.710
It's actually kind of
a cool piece.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.078
You know, like kitchenette?

06:51.178 --> 06:52.379
- Let's walk away
and say we don't want it.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.681
- Okay.
Not this one.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.082
- Not this one.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.717
How much

06:56.817 --> 06:58.786
Give me a couple hundred?

06:58.886 --> 07:00.220
200 bucks?
- $20!

07:00.320 --> 07:02.322
- Yup!

07:02.422 --> 07:04.291
- 30, 40, 50.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.326
- That's what
we're talking about.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.961
- 75.
- Yup!

07:09.663 --> 07:11.164
- You guys are trippin'.
- 125.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.833
- Yup!

07:12.933 --> 07:14.434
Oh, really?

07:14.535 --> 07:16.970
150. 150 there. 175.
- Yup!

07:17.070 --> 07:19.673
- Tell him, folks! Whoo!

07:19.773 --> 07:21.441
- Nope.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.877
All through?
All through

07:23.977 --> 07:26.179
25 and a half?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.882
Sell it your way.
- We got that! Mm!

07:28.982 --> 07:31.552
- I would be so excited.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.721
- Vegas bound, baby!

07:33.821 --> 07:35.155
- Now we can have lunch.
- Let's go.

07:35.255 --> 07:38.058
Finally. And Laurie didn't even
have to take off her top.

07:39.593 --> 07:43.931
- Let's make it happen here
at Riverside, folks! Whoo!

07:44.031 --> 07:45.733
- Wow, it's deep.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.435
*

07:48.536 --> 07:50.270
- Oh, there's the 20s
you've been wanting too.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.639
- I want the 10s.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.607
- That dresser might
be something.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.243
Nice bed frame.
- Only good unit today.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.311
*

07:58.411 --> 08:02.950
- We got mattresses.
We got duffel bag. Furniture.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.417
I mean, I gotta at least
make some gas money.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.654
I'm probably gonna
bid on this.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.456
- Furniture's nicely wrapped.
And maybe there's stuff inside.

08:09.557 --> 08:12.860
- Those two pieces, man.
Tempting indeed.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.595
- For anybody
that doesn't know this,

08:14.695 --> 08:16.463
Rene's not supposed to be
in Riverside today,

08:16.564 --> 08:18.632
so please,
if you're his friend,

08:18.732 --> 08:20.701
do not tell his wife
that he's here today.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.203
- Well, you'd be surprised

08:23.303 --> 08:25.573
how many men have his wife's
phone number.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.307
- Wow.
- Oh, no!

08:29.409 --> 08:31.444
- Nice couch set in there.
The weights are good.

08:31.545 --> 08:34.081
The cleaner's good,
but not much mystery.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.217
If I were a smart husband,
I wouldn't bid on this locker.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.219
I'm pretty dumb.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.288
*

08:41.388 --> 08:42.956
- All right, and if you're
ready to go, I'm ready to go.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.257
Here we go, how much money?
What you gonna pay for it?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.693
- Last unit.
- 25.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.360
- I got 25 here. $50.
- 50.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.129
$50 here.
75 now.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.798
- Yep.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.733
- Right here.
125.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.202
- 125.
- 125. 150. 150.

08:55.302 --> 08:56.604
- Okay.

08:56.704 --> 08:59.439
- 1 and a half there.
175 now. 150. 175. You're out.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.241
- Yeah, why not.
- 175. 175.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.710
- All right.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.544
- No.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.379
200 going once.
200 going twice.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.448
- Yep!

09:08.548 --> 09:11.218
- Whoo! You hounded the race.
- 225 and you're out.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.587
225, bid 250.
- Yep.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.958
- Yup!
- 325, 325.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.127
350.
- Yup!

09:20.227 --> 09:22.996
400.
- Yup.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.632
- 400 there. 425 now.
I got 400 bucks. 425.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.166
I got 400 bucks. 425.
425 going once.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.968
425 going twice.
Last call.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.536
425.

09:29.637 --> 09:32.305
Thank you for your help.
You got it, $400.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.506
- You never had a chance,
Jarrod.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.442
- 400 bucks, baby.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.210
- This is the best locker
of the day.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.879
But that's not saying
a whole lot.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.547
- Whoo! Folks, that's the end
of the sale

09:40.648 --> 09:41.849
and don't forget
to pay the lady.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.416
Thank you, everyone.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.252
- No.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.620
- Nope.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.321
Since we didn't buy today,

09:48.421 --> 09:49.923
maybe we take a note
from the locals.

09:50.023 --> 09:50.924
It's time for a drink.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.029
- Well, the good part about
not buying is

09:56.129 --> 09:57.765
I don't have to explain
anything to Casey.

09:57.865 --> 09:58.932
But I have to figure out

09:59.032 --> 10:00.067
a way to move
some merchandise

10:00.167 --> 10:02.202
so I can buy whater I want.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.370
She'll never know.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.173
They don't know
what they're doing.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.375
We channeled the vintage
with our Golden Girls swag.

10:08.475 --> 10:11.244
- And I actually think
the vintage energy worked.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.680
*

10:12.780 --> 10:13.681
- Oh!

10:13.781 --> 10:14.882
- Oh, crap!

10:14.982 --> 10:16.516
Treasures are falling on me.
- I know.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.618
- Let's put it together.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.220
- We could sell this for,
like, 200 bucks.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.889
- 200 already. Boom.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.556
- Ooh!

10:23.657 --> 10:25.092
- Wow!

10:25.192 --> 10:27.427
- Shana, this, right here,
is another 200 bucks

10:27.527 --> 10:28.929
just ready to go.
- We don't have to do anything.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.231
- Nothing.
- $30 mirror.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.233
- Oh, this is gorgeous.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.736
This is what I was excited
about.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.771
Oh! Nails.
- Nails.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.840
- Well.
- But great ammo can.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.174
15 bucks.
- All right.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.776
- Okay, the rest
of the tools...

10:42.876 --> 10:45.946
This is miscellaneous.
10 bucks. Done.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.515
So we got some 12-inch
Kenwood eXcelons,

10:48.615 --> 10:50.718
and we have an amp--
not bad.

10:50.818 --> 10:54.587
Speakers, 100.
75 for the box. 50 for the amp.

10:54.688 --> 10:58.125
This says "Barbie and Toys."

10:58.225 --> 11:00.493
- This says "Barbie and Toys."

11:00.593 --> 11:02.195
Look at the phone!

11:02.295 --> 11:03.697
- Oh, my God,
the vintage phone!

11:03.797 --> 11:05.632
- I love the puke green.
- Edwina!

11:05.733 --> 11:07.735
- I think we got out unit

11:07.835 --> 11:09.469
that we've been dreaming of.
- Yes!

11:09.569 --> 11:11.204
- $15.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.272
- $15. It's vintage, girl.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.807
- I'm locking that up
right now.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.044
- $40.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.546
$40 it is! Vintage phone.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.548
Edwina!

11:21.648 --> 11:23.350
Oh, my God. It's a lamp phone!

11:23.450 --> 11:25.953
Made in USA.
So it's probably some quality.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.955
All right, let's keep this one
to the side.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.723
All right, these are crafts.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.191
- Oh, shut your face.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.893
- Get out of here!

11:32.993 --> 11:34.627
- Shut--get it out of here.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.363
- Let's go back and sit down
in our nook area.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.267
- Oh, my God, is
that a telegraph, like...

11:40.367 --> 11:41.534
Pick up line 2, pick it up.

11:41.634 --> 11:42.870
Your husband's calling
you again.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.671
You didn't pick him up.
You didn't call him.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.507
Look, Stromberg.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.609
From France!
both: Burgundy.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.744
- This is pre-smartphone tech.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.579
- Okay, we have to get
this checked out.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.581
- We have found our calling.

11:54.681 --> 11:55.749
- And I really think
these phones

11:55.849 --> 11:57.650
are gonna ring us up
a profit.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.555
- You guys trying to make
some money?

12:02.655 --> 12:03.857
- Oh, we took all the money.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.525
- All.
Nailed 'em.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.262
- Well, I spent 400 bucks.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.999
I think I'm gonna be nickel
and diming my way to a profit.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.201
*

12:14.301 --> 12:16.870
All right, let's see what we
got going on in here.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.305
$5 in clothes.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.641
Junk. Trash can. Trash can.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.176
$5 fan.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.845
Kitchenware, $5.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.680
Jeans and more jeans.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.449
$25 worth of jeans.

12:29.549 --> 12:33.686
Ah, steam pot.
That's 25 bucks right there.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.355
It's all stained.
Doesn't matter.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.926
It looks like we have a table,
four chairs,

12:39.026 --> 12:40.627
and a china cabinet,

12:40.727 --> 12:42.930
which is gonna be, eh,
100 bucks.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.032
We've got about
a $10 microwave.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.566
Oil can.

12:46.666 --> 12:49.469
This is actually the coolest
thing in here.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.004
Eagle. I've seen a lot
of old oil cans,

12:51.104 --> 12:53.941
but I've never seen one with,
like, a two foot spout in it,

12:54.041 --> 12:57.811
so I'm gonna presume it's for
reaching in pretty far.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.312
100 bucks.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.982
Got a dresser, and it has a
matching headboard.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.151
There's a footboard
right here in the corner.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.819
100 bucks.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.722
Conductor hat.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.093
- Ooh. Look at this.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.062
Planimeter number 4211.

13:15.162 --> 13:18.198
This is for drafting, maybe?
For making plans.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.000
There's another box in here
too.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.171
Well, this is something
interesting.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.973
Some blank paper.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.675
Oh, here we go.
It says...

13:28.775 --> 13:30.610
"American steam gauge."

13:30.710 --> 13:32.179
Maybe it's a steam whistle.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.446
Choo choo!

13:33.546 --> 13:35.782
Think I'm gonna jump
on the money train here,

13:35.883 --> 13:38.051
try to figure out
what this is.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.453
So I'm gonna have to take this
probably to some kind of

13:40.553 --> 13:43.256
conductor, train guy.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.993
Meanwhile, I'm gonna put
my "Yup" hat back on

13:46.093 --> 13:49.429
and presume my responsibility
as the Yup Man.

13:49.529 --> 13:52.365
Looks like we have
a sectional couch,

13:52.465 --> 13:55.702
ottoman, and it's gonna be
a big L shape, I think.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.971
Probably 150 bucks right there.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.672
$20 lamp.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.109
Eh, you probably got $50
in weights.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.710
Got your $10 dolly.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.778
$20 vacuum.

14:05.879 --> 14:09.682
And that, folks,
concludes

14:09.782 --> 14:10.850
the Yup experience

14:10.951 --> 14:12.920
in beautiful
Riverside, California.

14:13.020 --> 14:13.987
I should've known.

14:14.087 --> 14:17.124
Darrell and Rene
are full of steam.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.559
Out of all the auctions
I've ever attended,

14:19.659 --> 14:21.828
this was certainly one of 'em.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.666
- All right, Dad, come on.
Customers are coming. Let's go.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.603
- You said I'm gonna be Santa.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.272
- There's only one Santa
around here.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.474
The only way Casey will let me
buy more lockers

14:34.574 --> 14:36.076
is if we make room
in the store.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.178
Time for bargain hunter's
Christmas sale.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.680
Gunter and Tatiana, you guys
gonna run the register.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.482
You and me, we gonna help
customers.

14:42.582 --> 14:45.285
Remember, the entire store,
25% off, okay?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.220
- All right, let's do this.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.589
- You're watching a tree.
- Casey, don't let any dogs in.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.092
- Ho, ho, ho.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.127
See these, I like it.
Do you like music?

14:54.227 --> 14:55.996
- Yeah.
- You don't look like it.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.497
- Hey, welcome
to Bargain Hunters.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.533
Everything 25% off.
Ho, ho, ho!

15:00.633 --> 15:01.601
I need a bell.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.238
- It's a decoration.
- A beaded tree.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.540
- Madonna used to have
some of those.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.777
- I'll come through
the chimney.

15:10.877 --> 15:11.945
You leave me
some cookies and milk

15:12.045 --> 15:13.280
and I'll bring you
presents.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.116
- Yeah.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.118
- We're not sure of anything
at the moment.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.622
High five Boop.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.125
*

15:25.225 --> 15:26.559
You're supposed to be--
- I bought a gum.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.461
- Go work!
You're, like, so distracted.

15:28.561 --> 15:32.699
- 20, 40, 60, 70, 80.

15:32.799 --> 15:36.103
90, 100, 105.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.105
- Don't forget the 25% off.
- Oh, yeah.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.007
- Unless the customer
doesn't notice.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.874
- Do you believe in love
at first sight,

15:41.975 --> 15:43.143
or should I walk by again?

15:43.243 --> 15:44.444
- Oh...
- Dad, Dad, Dad.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.479
- I'm sorry, ladies.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.348
Come on in.
The entire store's 25%--

15:48.448 --> 15:50.083
- Take the sign up to the road.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.851
Flag down some cars.
Come on.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.653
Just keep going straight.
You'll hit the road.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.225
*

15:59.959 --> 16:02.029
I'm tired.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.765
Gunter!

16:05.865 --> 16:07.134
What happened
to the street signs?

16:07.234 --> 16:09.302
- I was out there.
Almost got run over.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.905
If we do really well today,

16:13.006 --> 16:15.175
Casey will be less upset
about me going to auctions.

16:15.275 --> 16:18.078
- Ooh, drum roll.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.013
- We made...

16:20.113 --> 16:22.582
- Three thousand...
Nine hundred...

16:22.682 --> 16:25.218
- Oh, my God.
39 and 15 cents.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.687
- Awesome! Great!

16:27.787 --> 16:30.057
- Whoo!
- Wow. So I'm done now.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.559
I'm gonna get out of this.
- Okay, great.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.594
I'm gonna go buy
more storage units.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.063
- Uh-huh.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.797
Dressed like that?

16:39.832 --> 16:42.001
*

16:42.102 --> 16:43.336
- Thank you.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.406
We are at Golden Telephones
to meet Dan Golden.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.741
- Here I am, in living color.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.144
- We're hoping our phones
are older than Golden.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.581
- Okay, so which one do you
think is the least valuable?

16:54.681 --> 16:57.784
- Okay, I'm pretty sure
it's this one.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.686
- You're absolutely correct.
- Oh, good.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.554
- Because someone ruined
an antique.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.156
We're gonna polish up
the brass.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.957
You scrape
off the nickel plating

17:05.058 --> 17:06.126
and drill
a hole in the top.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.727
You can make a lamp
out of it.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.896
And they just ruined
an antique telephone.

17:09.996 --> 17:12.099
- So how much
do you think it's worth?

17:12.199 --> 17:13.333
- Well, I don't want it at all.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.036
- All rightie then. Next!
- Okay.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.838
- This one here...

17:18.938 --> 17:20.473
- So this is
the intercom phone.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.041
Art deco collectors
would like this

17:22.142 --> 17:23.543
because of the Bakelite look.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.345
The phone is
in excellent condition.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.947
These ears almost always broke,
and the buttons are missing.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.449
Yours is great.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.718
It's around the $100 category.
both: Oh!

17:31.818 --> 17:34.587
- Okay, so I think we saved
the best for last.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.090
- This phone came
from Paris, France.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.358
both: Yes!

17:38.458 --> 17:40.960
- And before cell phones,
young ladies were not

17:41.060 --> 17:42.595
allowed to talk
on the telephone

17:42.695 --> 17:45.332
unless the future
mother-in-law listened in,

17:45.432 --> 17:47.667
and this is called
the mother-in-law piece.

17:47.767 --> 17:51.138
- It is not!
- You had the range for dates.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.540
Suitors could not talk

17:53.640 --> 17:55.642
without the mother
listening in.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.211
- Can you imagine if our moms
heard our phone calls?

17:58.311 --> 17:59.679
- I don't even wanna
think about it.

17:59.779 --> 18:00.980
- This'll sell right away

18:01.080 --> 18:03.283
because your mother-in-law
piece is not gone.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.818
The original exterior phone
is great.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.654
It's a museum item.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.789
And so...

18:12.225 --> 18:14.927
At least 450.
- That's exciting.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.963
- Oh, my gosh.
- So that would be good.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.199
- I'm just gonna keep this
for my children.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.767
Okay.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.040
- Going for a ride
with all my friends.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.177
You guys ready?

18:30.277 --> 18:32.179
I think I found
some interesting train parts.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.914
So I'm here to see
Nancy Ganier at Travel Town.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.249
- Welcome to Travel Town.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.285
- You could probably tell me...

18:38.385 --> 18:40.620
- All right, let's see
these things.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.854
Pretty cool.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.956
This is a steam gauge
indicator.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.693
They would put this on the
cylinder of a train.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.228
- Okay.
- You would attach one of these

18:48.328 --> 18:50.930
pieces of paper to this
cylinder here,

18:51.030 --> 18:53.700
and then as the pressure from
the steam came in,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.369
the steam would force this
to turn.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.839
This little guy would
have a pencil attached to it

18:59.939 --> 19:02.141
and then this valve
would go up and down,

19:02.242 --> 19:05.011
and it would actually create
a little drawing

19:05.111 --> 19:06.946
of the efficiency
of the cylinder.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.415
- Kinda like a graph type
thing.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.350
- Exactly. This draws
the pretty graph.

19:10.450 --> 19:14.554
- Okay.
But this...

19:14.654 --> 19:16.456
Yeah, okay, as you see here,

19:16.556 --> 19:18.124
this is called a planimeter.
- Mm-hmm.

19:18.225 --> 19:21.027
- And it measures a plane.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.029
In this case, the plane
would've been

19:23.129 --> 19:25.598
on the piece of paper
that the indicator drew.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.467
- Okay.
- This was important because

19:27.567 --> 19:28.935
you would compare cylinders
on both sides

19:29.035 --> 19:31.003
of the steam locomotive
to make sure they were equal.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.172
You didn't want one side
being stronger than the other.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.742
So these tools were used
to help

19:35.842 --> 19:37.744
not the engineers driving
the train,

19:37.844 --> 19:39.646
but the engineers
who were building the engines.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.148
- Wow. Nancy, now that
you've seen these things,

19:42.249 --> 19:44.651
what do you think
the value of these things are?

19:44.751 --> 19:46.419
Well.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.187
The planimeter,

19:48.288 --> 19:49.689
to a collector...

19:49.789 --> 19:51.991
*

19:52.091 --> 19:54.327
Probably be worth about $100.
- Okay.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.497
- And then, the steam gauge
indicator,

19:57.597 --> 20:00.433
I'd say that one'd
be about...

20:03.202 --> 20:04.471
$300.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.274
- Well, I hate to toot
my own horn,

20:07.374 --> 20:09.842
but I think that I got
a pretty good buy there.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.110
Choo choo!

20:11.210 --> 20:13.613
*

20:13.713 --> 20:16.449
announcer: Rene Nezhoda
went from naughty to nice,

20:16.549 --> 20:19.552
making a jolly $4,000.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.088
Edwina and Shana were golden,

20:22.188 --> 20:24.424
phoning in an extra grand.

20:24.524 --> 20:28.561
Dave Hester steamed his way
to a nice little payday.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.264
While Brandi and Jarrod
turned to...

20:31.364 --> 20:32.799
Local spirits.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.200
- It's time for a drink.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.668
*

20:35.768 --> 20:37.470
- Merry Christmas.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.906
25% off!

20:40.006 --> 20:41.674
*

20:41.774 --> 20:42.975
That way.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.977
*

20:47.013 --> 20:50.883
Merry Christmas! Oops!
He almost had an accident.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.985
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

20:53.085 --> 20:54.854
Oh, this sucks, man.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.290
*
