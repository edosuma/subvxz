00:02.753 --> 00:04.163
NARRA TOR:
Previously on Heroes.

00:04.255 --> 00:05.665
Trying to hear my thoughts,
Matt?

00:05.756 --> 00:07.917
Not with my friend here.
He's special, too.

00:08.092 --> 00:11.755
Everything we say,
everything you see,
by tomorrow it won’t matter.

00:13.139 --> 00:15.676
AUDREY: Three months ago
myjob made
perfect sense to me.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.222
Then I pulled the Sylar case.

00:17.310 --> 00:18.345
Gabriel Sylar.

00:19.729 --> 00:21.560
EDEN: You're gonna be
completely clean in no time.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.763
And you're sure
I'll still be able to paint?

00:23.858 --> 00:25.268
After I teach you, yes.

00:25.484 --> 00:28.100
NA THAN: Peter’s got all these
ideas in his head.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.936
Thinks he’s supposed to
make a difference.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.020
You believe him?

00:31.115 --> 00:32.980
I'm not sure
what to believe anymore.

00:33.075 --> 00:36.693
I'm taking Micah,
and I'm taking the money.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.288
We're going hunting.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.987
I told her where we are.
She's on her way.

00:41.334 --> 00:43.450
(SPEAKING IN JAPANESE)

00:47.089 --> 00:48.124
You're not done here.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.752
That's why I'm not even
going to say goodbye.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.878
Now that you know about them,
what will you do?

00:51.969 --> 00:54.927
Find them.
Tell them who they are
if they don't already know.

00:55.014 --> 00:56.970
Warn them of the dangers
they face.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.674
I know when and I know where
the cheerleader gets attacked.

00:59.769 --> 01:01.725
l have to stop him.

01:03.689 --> 01:06.146
You don't want to hurt me.
Go to sleep.

01:11.489 --> 01:13.070
How did you...
Are you the one?

01:13.157 --> 01:14.818
By saving you
did I save the world?

01:14.909 --> 01:16.740
Put your hands on your head!

01:16.827 --> 01:17.816
What are you doing?

01:17.912 --> 01:19.118
You're lucky to be alive.

01:19.205 --> 01:22.868
It's not luck, Dad.
I have something
I have to tell you.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.889
Are you mad at me?

01:42.019 --> 01:44.431
You haven't said anything
since we got in the car.

01:44.522 --> 01:46.183
Since I told you.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.943
No. No. No, ljust...
I've just been thinking.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.865
l have something
I need to tell you.

01:57.952 --> 02:00.534
It's not fair to keep it
from you any longer.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.830
What you can do...

02:08.337 --> 02:10.043
I've known about you, Claire.

02:10.423 --> 02:14.666
I knew before you knew,
before you made
those tapes with Zach.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.466
You saw the tape?

02:17.930 --> 02:19.340
Why didn't you say anything?

02:19.432 --> 02:22.469
There are a lot of reasons
but mostly I just
wanted to protect you.

02:22.560 --> 02:26.473
Protect me?
All this time
I felt so alone, and...

02:26.564 --> 02:29.271
And like some sort of freak
and you knew?

02:29.358 --> 02:33.897
I've worked very hard.
I've done some things that I'm
not proud of to keep you safe.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.399
What kinds of things?

02:40.161 --> 02:42.743
I just wanted you
to have a normal life.

02:43.414 --> 02:45.405
Jackie died because of me.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.337
He thought she was me,
didn't he?

02:51.339 --> 02:53.921
That man is taken care of.

02:54.383 --> 02:55.919
I promise you.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.251
You and Mom knew
all this time.

02:58.763 --> 03:02.301
Your mother doesn't know,
and neither does your brother.

03:03.476 --> 03:05.808
Actually, Lyle kind of
found out.

03:05.895 --> 03:08.261
Really? Anybody else?

03:09.440 --> 03:10.930
Zach.

03:11.901 --> 03:14.768
Nobody else can know.
It's the only way
to keep you safe.

03:14.987 --> 03:19.151
That man who tried
to kill you, there are
others out there like him

03:19.241 --> 03:21.698
who want what you have
and will hurt you to get it.

03:21.786 --> 03:25.529
That's why we can't tell your
mother, we can't tell anybody.

03:27.875 --> 03:28.864
Yeah.

03:30.795 --> 03:33.127
I'm gonna pick Lyle up
from practice
and I'll talk to him.

03:33.214 --> 03:37.799
You talk to Zach.
And the tapes you made,
I need you to destroy them.

03:43.307 --> 03:46.595
MATT: The victim was
a student, Jacqueline Wilcox.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.017
And the crime scene
fits Sylar's MO.

03:49.105 --> 03:50.470
He took her brain?

03:51.273 --> 03:54.185
No, but the incision on her
skull said he wanted to
but somebody got in his way.

03:54.276 --> 03:57.734
Well, they have a suspect
in custody, a hospice nurse
from New York.

03:57.822 --> 03:59.403
And you think
he might be Sylar?

03:59.490 --> 04:01.526
No. I think this is.

04:02.952 --> 04:06.285
See, judging by the blood
patterns I'd say he stopped
here to catch his breath

04:06.372 --> 04:08.579
and then just disappeared.

04:08.666 --> 04:11.999
You know what? Maybe
he didn't. Look at this.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.997
The tread patterns are totally
different. These are two
new sets of footprints.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.673
That's the fourth handful
of those you've knocked down

04:19.760 --> 04:22.092
since we got off the plane.
I have headaches.

04:24.348 --> 04:25.713
It's the whole Janice thing.
It's...

04:25.808 --> 04:29.016
She slipped up, Parkman.
It sucks but it happens.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.926
You've never cheated on her?

04:31.021 --> 04:32.227
No.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.263
You don't believe me.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.393
Well, statistically speaking,

04:35.484 --> 04:38.226
law enforcement attracts
a certain kind of
male personality.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.106
Oh, what personality
would that be?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.186
Dogs.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.193
And the female personality?

04:43.284 --> 04:45.991
Bitches. We keep it
in the canine family.

04:46.662 --> 04:50.450
Okay, so, two new sets
of footprints. You think Sylar
had accomplices?

04:50.541 --> 04:53.783
With the amount of blood
he lost there's no way
he got out of here by himself.

04:53.878 --> 04:57.666
So, I guess we'll ask
this Peter Petrelli.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.845
Hey. What are you...
What are you doing here?

05:14.273 --> 05:18.858
You get in trouble, I drop
everything and fix it.
Isn't that how things work?

05:20.738 --> 05:21.818
Get you out of here soon.

05:21.906 --> 05:23.646
What, no lecture?

05:23.949 --> 05:25.905
I'm just glad you're alive.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.779
Why did you destroy
that painting?

05:27.870 --> 05:29.360
Why did you try and keep me
from coming here?

05:29.455 --> 05:32.037
That painting
showed you dead, Peter.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.080
And when I got the phone call
I nearly believed it
for a minute.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.500
Yeah, I thought I'd be a hero.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.624
Yeah, how did that
work out for you?

05:39.715 --> 05:42.252
Save the cheerleader,
save the world.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.835
You're meant to do a lot
of things Peter,

05:45.930 --> 05:48.342
but saving the world
isn't one of them.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.344
You've got to learn
to recognize when life
is bigger than you are.

05:51.435 --> 05:55.519
You're not a fighter.
But that's okay.
The world needs nurses, too.

05:55.606 --> 05:58.598
When I'm around you
I can do what you can do.

05:59.235 --> 06:02.568
lsaac, Hiro Nakamura,
this girl Claire.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.187
See, I... lthink that
we're all the same.

06:05.491 --> 06:10.781
Somehow this bomb that lsaac
painted, I think we're
supposed to stop it. ljust...

06:14.291 --> 06:16.373
I don't think I can do it.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.787
That's because you can't.

06:22.174 --> 06:26.668
How can you stop what's coming
when you don't know
anything about power?

06:27.263 --> 06:28.469
(GASPING)

06:48.909 --> 06:50.365
(GUN FIRING)

06:56.041 --> 06:57.030
(GUN FIRING)

06:57.126 --> 06:58.741
Micah!
Dad!

06:59.837 --> 07:01.168
Stay down!

07:26.905 --> 07:28.645
What are you looking at?

07:42.671 --> 07:43.786
Anything?

07:43.881 --> 07:45.872
Slept through the night.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.381
I got this.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.771
You lost a lot of blood.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.698
We sewed you up
the best we could.

08:16.288 --> 08:19.325
Turns out you’re not so
untouchable after all.

08:20.876 --> 08:24.915
Oh, no, you'll find
your abilities won't work,
not here.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.589
You’re not going anywhere,
Gabriel.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.132
My name is Sylar.

08:30.219 --> 08:31.299
Now it is.

08:31.387 --> 08:34.629
Wasn't so long ago that you
were Gabriel Gray,

08:34.723 --> 08:37.806
an insignificant watchmaker.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.683
l restore time pieces.

08:43.107 --> 08:45.018
You know why
I was so good at it?

08:45.109 --> 08:46.599
No, why don’t you tell me?

08:47.778 --> 08:52.192
Because I can see
how things work,
what makes them

08:52.282 --> 08:53.271
tick.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.449
Like you.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.739
We ’re interested
in how things work as well.

08:58.831 --> 09:04.292
Everyone else we've met
has had only one ability.
You've taken on several.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.539
I guess that’s what
makes me special.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.995
That’s important to you,
isn ’t it?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.250
Being special.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.626
It's important to everyone.

09:10.718 --> 09:15.508
I think you're insane. I think
the infusion of so many
alterations to your DNA

09:15.597 --> 09:19.260
has corrupted your mind.
All this power
is degrading you.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.216
And yet here I am,
alive and well, and as soon as

09:21.311 --> 09:25.429
| get out I'm going to collect
one more ability
from your daughter.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.348
Sweet, innocent...

09:27.443 --> 09:28.558
That’s enough.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.734
...ripe, indestructible.

09:30.821 --> 09:32.857
I said that's enough, Gabriel!

09:32.948 --> 09:34.779
My name is Sylar!

09:46.003 --> 09:49.086
Options? There are no options
with an individual like this.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.505
Maybe I didn't make
the risk clear...

09:53.177 --> 09:55.168
Understood. Of course.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.593
Is it true?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.261
You have to be a little bit
more specific, Eden.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.304
I've got more than one house
on fire at the moment.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.007
We're keeping him alive.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.184
Those are our marching orders.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.104
Think about what
he almost did to Claire.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.557
I could tell him
to kill himself.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.190
No one would have to know.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.374
I don't have time
for this. Not today.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.076
You know I'm right!

10:29.171 --> 10:33.414
I know I'm right, and if
that Haitian could speak,
he'd tell you I'm right.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.729
Micah, take that.
Pull it down. That's it.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.823
Walk back the way you came.
In the footsteps.

11:02.538 --> 11:03.573
Like the Indians.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.404
Just like the Indians, son.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.448
That wasn't the police.

11:08.544 --> 11:09.829
You don't know that.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.208
Dad, they've got to warn you
before they shoot.
It's a rule.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.965
Police don't always follow
the rules, son. Trust me.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.257
Give me a hand.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.262
Right here.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.342
Dad, are you gonna be okay?

12:08.437 --> 12:11.349
I'm your dad.
I'm gonna be as good as new.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.933
ljust need you to help me
with these bandages.
You can do that, right?

12:16.028 --> 12:17.393
Yeah.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.476
All right.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.778
It was her, wasn't it?
It was Jessica.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.741
Sure looked like your mom.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.866
Morn would never hurt you
on purpose.

12:33.837 --> 12:37.796
Shejust did, Micah.
A couple inches
to the left and...

12:43.805 --> 12:47.844
Dad? Dad, wake up!
Dad, you need to wake up!

12:50.020 --> 12:52.511
Your brother's
pretty well connected.

12:52.606 --> 12:57.225
Even down here. We had to
climb over six lawyers
to get to you, Mr. Petrelli.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.061
Are you okay?

13:00.155 --> 13:03.067
My head feels like
it's going to split open.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.694
Help yourself.

13:06.870 --> 13:07.859
I didn't kill that girl.

13:07.955 --> 13:08.944
We know.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.654
The blood found on you
was your own.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.286
We checked you out
and you don't seem to have
any injuries.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.288
Care to explain that?

13:17.965 --> 13:19.421
If I'm not being charged
can I go?

13:19.508 --> 13:21.294
What's a hospice nurse
from Manhattan

13:21.385 --> 13:23.171
doing at a high school
homecoming in Texas?

13:23.261 --> 13:25.252
You some kind of pervert?

13:28.892 --> 13:31.008
My brother said not to talk.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.718
We don't need you to talk.

13:38.402 --> 13:40.984
(VOICES MURMURING)

13:41.071 --> 13:43.733
PETER: We needed to save
the cheerleader.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.115
What are you doing to me?

13:56.169 --> 13:57.454
Save the cheerleader.

13:57.546 --> 13:58.752
AUDREY: Too late
for that, Matt.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.000
The cheerleader is dead.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.833
Claire's dead?
No, that's not possible.

14:03.927 --> 14:07.044
MATT: Did he just read her
mind? Is he one of them?

14:07.848 --> 14:10.635
The cheerleader's name was
Jackie Wilcox. What the hell
is going on here?

14:10.726 --> 14:12.466
No, Claire is the one
that he wanted.
Claire?

14:12.561 --> 14:13.767
What, you're not
protecting her?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.060
Why would you know
who he wanted?

14:15.147 --> 14:17.183
You want to catch this guy?
You need to find her.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.310
You need to protect her.

14:21.153 --> 14:22.768
He's telling the truth.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.979
We better find
this cheerleader.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.609
You're not going to
let me out of here?

14:26.700 --> 14:28.907
You get out
when I get answers.

14:54.019 --> 14:57.511
l faxed the list to your
Quantico office yesterday.
Names, addresses.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.813
Why haven't you warned them?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.642
Looking into it?
At least six of the people
on this list are dead,

15:02.736 --> 15:05.068
all of them from
the same killer.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.237
James Walker in Los Angeles
was killed nine days ago.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.407
Charlene Andrews,
two days ago, Midland, Texas.

15:10.494 --> 15:13.236
Doesn't this mean anything
to you people?

15:13.330 --> 15:16.322
Well, do you really
want to take that chance?

15:17.709 --> 15:19.825
Fine, lwon't. Never mind.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.138
You're sketching.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.261
larn.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.854
And you're sober.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.183
The locks on the door helped.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.025
Anything interesting?

15:46.113 --> 15:49.321
Nothing predictive
if that's what you're asking.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.951
I don't think I can
do it clean.

15:52.536 --> 15:53.525
You'll get there.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.745
To be honest,
it's nice to be drawing
just to draw again.

15:56.832 --> 16:00.165
That's what I liked about
comics. You don't have to
take them too seriously.

16:00.252 --> 16:02.208

16:03.713 --> 16:09.424
Which reminds me, Claire,
the cheerleader, she's alive.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.136
Peter, he saved her.

16:13.223 --> 16:14.303
No, you did.

16:14.391 --> 16:17.053
With your gift.
I mean, thanks to you

16:17.144 --> 16:19.726
Sylar won't be able to
hurt anybody anymore.

16:19.813 --> 16:23.397
This means we can
change the future,
maybe stop that bomb.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.228
Well, I wish you
the best of luck.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.727
What? Where are you going?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.653
Off the reservation.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.401
You're leaving?

16:33.451 --> 16:38.161

the future if no one will
do anything to change it?

Hiro, we need to meet.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.626

18:12.717 --> 18:15.094
I tried to save her
but he was killing her.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.423
She told me to run so I ran.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.556
I left her, and I ran.

/ know you’ve been

I just have
a few more questions.

18:31.194 --> 18:34.937
This man, did he exhibit
anything out of the ordinary?

18:40.787 --> 18:43.028
You mean besides killing
my friend?

18:44.624 --> 18:48.492
No, like being able to fall
five stories and walk away
without a scratch.

18:48.586 --> 18:49.746
What?

18:49.838 --> 18:52.625
Well, you said Peter Petrelli
tackled the man
who killed Jackie

18:52.716 --> 18:56.334
and they both
fell over the ledge.
That's a pretty long fall.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.639

19:02.726 --> 19:05.012
He survived without a scratch.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.889
All I know is
he saved my life.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.975
Well, he's a very lucky guy.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.731
You didn't seem to
get hurt at all either.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.405

20:11.711 --> 20:12.951
You mean silence?

this thing is.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.751
D.L. is a criminal.

He brought danger into
our home. You want Micah
to end up like that?

is that somebody
got killed in the high school,

26:21.330 --> 26:25.915
but everybody knows it's
Jackie. I got like four
text messages this morning.

26:26.002 --> 26:27.412
Did you bring the tapes?

26:27.503 --> 26:28.492
Yeah.

26:29.672 --> 26:31.173
It wasn't that much to...

26:35.470 --> 26:37.677
That's pretty destroyed,
right?

Yeah, I don't think
they're gonna play again.

I feel really bad

26:43.478 --> 26:44.809
about breaking you out
and pushing you to go

26:44.896 --> 26:46.602
to homecoming last night.
I'm sorry.

26:46.689 --> 26:48.554
You shouldn't feel bad.

26:49.025 --> 26:53.485
You did it because
you're my friend. Probably
the best friend I ever had.

You know, I've only been
your friend for two weeks.

it wasn't pathetic.

going to say
anything to anyone.

It exploded the city
and destroyed many things.

And I saw you...

28:20.199 --> 28:21.530
What about me?

28:23.911 --> 28:25.617
I saw you on the floor.

28:25.705 --> 28:29.448
You were dead,
with your head cut off.

28:32.003 --> 28:33.118
Okay.

28:35.131 --> 28:39.295

he's taken care of.

He's caught?

This is very good news.
Hiro lost a friend.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.635
The brain man killed her.

28:54.275 --> 28:55.765
Wait a minute.

28:58.821 --> 29:02.439
I painted this two days ago,
sober. Is this your friend?

29:02.867 --> 29:04.152
HIRO: Yes.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.154
I did it.

29:06.829 --> 29:09.787
You say your mission
is to stop the bomb
in New York.

29:09.874 --> 29:12.081
Yes. Our destiny.

29:12.168 --> 29:14.204
I think it may be mine, too.

29:16.839 --> 29:18.921
I painted that mural
on my floor.

29:19.008 --> 29:21.670
And very recently
I painted a picture of

29:24.305 --> 29:26.216
a man exploding.

29:28.351 --> 29:30.683
How do you stop
an exploding man?

29:36.525 --> 29:37.651
Mom?

29:39.028 --> 29:40.017
Dad?

29:41.614 --> 29:44.526
Mom's at the store.
I don't know where Dad is.

29:46.243 --> 29:47.744
Did dad talk to you?

29:47.828 --> 29:48.817
About what?

29:49.205 --> 29:53.369
About me. He knows,
and he knows that you know.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.042
My thing?

29:58.339 --> 30:00.045
That I can't get hurt.

30:03.761 --> 30:05.422
That didn't hurt?

30:06.097 --> 30:07.803
Lyle, I'm serious.

30:09.642 --> 30:11.598
Now, tell me what Dad
said to you.

30:11.686 --> 30:12.801
I haven't seen Dad all day.

30:12.895 --> 30:14.931
But he was supposed to
pick you up from practice.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.523
Well, he didn't.

30:16.607 --> 30:18.222
Well, how'd you get home?

30:21.612 --> 30:23.898
Lyle, how did you get home?

30:28.744 --> 30:30.575
I... I don't remember.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.453
We can get you some help, Nik.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.586
I don't believe that
for a second.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.009
But you've seen
what she can do.

30:47.763 --> 30:49.173
How do explain that?

30:49.265 --> 30:51.631
There are a lot of things
that I can't explain.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.971
Like why you shot me.

30:55.062 --> 30:56.677
Jessica shot you.

30:57.606 --> 31:02.020
She's gonna come back
and take Micah.
She's out of control.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.810
She could really hurt him.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.795
Come on.
We'll get you to a hotel.

31:24.341 --> 31:26.297
We're gonna get you
cleaned up, all right?

Nik, we're gonna
go to a hotel.

31:38.606 --> 31:40.437
Can I help you, ma'am?

31:40.775 --> 31:42.515
Yeah, you can arrest me.

31:42.610 --> 31:44.350
Arrest you? For what?

31:45.196 --> 31:46.185

AUDREY: Really, Parkman?

31:55.664 --> 31:59.031

I don't take you anywhere.

32:08.511 --> 32:10.797
Oh, God, did he just
hear that?

32:10.888 --> 32:12.924
Did you just read my mind?

32:14.183 --> 32:15.298
You can't do that.

32:15.392 --> 32:19.101
It was a stray thought. I...
You can't do that.

32:20.356 --> 32:22.438
You really think I'm cute?

32:22.525 --> 32:24.766
I really think you're married.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.566
And I really think
you love your wife.

32:26.654 --> 32:27.814
I do.

32:27.905 --> 32:30.988
Then why haven't you called
to yell at her so you can
go home already?

32:31.075 --> 32:33.236
That's what you want,
isn't it?

32:33.744 --> 32:35.484
I don't want to be a chump.

32:35.579 --> 32:38.867
So, still loving your wife
after she has sex with someone
else makes you a chump.

32:38.958 --> 32:39.947
Doesn't it?

32:40.042 --> 32:41.202
Grow up, Parkman.

32:41.293 --> 32:44.035
If you want your marriage
to work, you have to find
a way to make it work.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.542
Otherwise you are
kind of a chump.

32:55.933 --> 32:59.892

heard that static.

33:08.070 --> 33:09.651

get out of here.

trying to get something.

What's the emergency?

33:43.939 --> 33:49.400
Something's going on.
It's like the Stepford
Body Snatchers or something.

33:50.112 --> 33:52.273
My brother doesn't
remember anything.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.822
What I can do, nothing.
It's like they made him
forget.

33:57.786 --> 34:01.324
All right, so this is another
one of your little cheerleader
initiation pranks, is that it?

34:01.415 --> 34:02.450
Hmm? Is it?

34:02.541 --> 34:05.624
Zach, are you listening to me?
Something is going on.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.205

34:07.296 --> 34:09.332
Look, you haven't talked
to me since sixth grade,

34:09.423 --> 34:12.381
and now you call me
out of the blue.
What is this about?

34:16.555 --> 34:17.715
They got you, too.

34:17.806 --> 34:22.095
Are you on crystal meth
or something, because this
is really cracky behavior.

34:52.258 --> 34:55.591
You see yourself
as some sort of
humanitarian, don't you?

and women who are different.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.348

feel powerful?

35:04.979 --> 35:09.348

You collect special people.
