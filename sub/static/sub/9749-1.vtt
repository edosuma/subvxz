01:49.838 --> 01:51.423
Have you had lunch?

01:51.423 --> 01:53.508
Yes, but late.
I said I'd be back at two.

01:55.177 --> 01:58.722
Brian, you don't like this
job any more than I do, do you?

01:58.805 --> 01:59.765
Of course not.

02:00.057 --> 02:02.351
The same all grind week after week.

02:02.559 --> 02:04.227
And so much stress.

02:04.227 --> 02:05.270
Yes, stress!

02:05.687 --> 02:07.564
- D'you want a valium?
- No way!

02:07.564 --> 02:08.607
Steak and chips.

02:08.607 --> 02:12.152
I thought you were supposed
to eat fish on a Friday.

02:12.152 --> 02:14.363
How you are out of date!

02:14.571 --> 02:16.948
Vatican II said we don't
have to do that any more.

02:17.074 --> 02:19.034
Who's Vatican II? The deputy Pope?

02:19.034 --> 02:23.121
Ignoramus. You
can't have a deputy Pope.

02:23.205 --> 02:26.041
The Pope is infallible.
You can't be deputy-infallible!

02:26.041 --> 02:28.126
- We have to go.
- Let them wait.

02:28.126 --> 02:31.546
Oi! A cup of tea over here, please!

02:33.632 --> 02:35.842
No pension plan, no insurance.

02:35.842 --> 02:37.386
No job security.

02:37.719 --> 02:39.721
Why don't we just pack it in?

02:39.721 --> 02:42.849
- I really hate this bank job.
- Me too.

02:42.849 --> 02:45.435
I don't know how to do anything else.

02:46.895 --> 02:50.649
Time for work, boys.
Back at two, remember?

03:15.799 --> 03:16.842
Stop!

03:19.344 --> 03:21.721
Hit the deck or you're dead!

03:28.395 --> 03:30.063
You shot Louis, you asshole!

03:30.063 --> 03:31.106
Oh shit!

03:38.405 --> 03:40.490
Give me the money or you're a dead man!

03:40.490 --> 03:43.535
Here, take it, you have it.
I don't care, it's not mine.

03:47.789 --> 03:51.459
- Shut your mouth!
- Kill the hysteric!

03:51.668 --> 03:54.880
I know how you feel.
Have a valium.

03:55.714 --> 03:56.756
Kill her!

03:56.756 --> 03:57.799
What with?

03:57.799 --> 03:58.842
With a gun!

03:59.593 --> 04:02.804
I haven't got a gun, you homicidal pillock!

04:02.804 --> 04:03.847
We've got it!

04:19.404 --> 04:22.199
It's just not like it used to be, Charlie.

04:22.199 --> 04:24.201
We work for a completely new breed.

04:24.492 --> 04:27.329
All those guns and violence...

04:27.746 --> 04:29.331
Even our poor Louie.

04:30.165 --> 04:31.833
That was an accident.

04:32.876 --> 04:35.170
Don't you eat your French fries?

04:35.170 --> 04:37.047
It's got like America now.

04:37.047 --> 04:39.549
Ever since Case took over the firm.

04:39.966 --> 04:42.344
And none of us used to carry guns.

04:42.344 --> 04:44.429
In the old days
when we nicked someone

04:44.638 --> 04:48.183
no one got hurt, and no one
lost anything very much.

04:48.183 --> 04:49.643
Insurance companies did.

04:49.976 --> 04:52.979
Yeah, well, they're bigger
thieves than we are.

04:52.979 --> 04:56.232
I thought I was too clever
to get involved with this heavy stuff.

04:56.524 --> 04:57.567
What do you think?

04:57.567 --> 04:59.152
We have no choice.

04:59.361 --> 05:03.198
Do you want to tell Case we no longer
want to be a part of his firm?

05:03.198 --> 05:05.700
- No.
- No, me neither.

05:06.743 --> 05:09.454
Look, all I know is they
wanted a fast driver.

05:09.454 --> 05:11.331
And that's all I ever wanted to be.

05:11.331 --> 05:12.374
How about a Mercedes?

05:12.791 --> 05:15.001
Ha, a bit bourgeois, don't you think?

05:15.627 --> 05:17.170
I fancy something a bit sporty.

05:17.212 --> 05:17.921
- That one.

05:18.338 --> 05:21.591
- No. I don't like
Italian cars. They rust.

05:22.217 --> 05:23.259
BMW.

05:24.177 --> 05:25.762
Trifle yuppy.

05:25.762 --> 05:28.973
Nice colour that red.
Casually your eyes.

05:28.973 --> 05:30.141
Very funny.

05:30.642 --> 05:34.104
Oi, oh, officer. I'm sorry.

05:34.104 --> 05:35.146
What are you doing?

05:35.647 --> 05:37.440
We couldn't get in.

05:37.732 --> 05:39.401
It's an all-ticket match.

05:39.401 --> 05:43.571
- Is it? Ah, we didn't  know that, did we mate?
- No.

05:45.365 --> 05:47.951
This will come in handy. Got his wallet.

05:47.951 --> 05:51.621
Charlie, you do not pick
the pocket of the police force!

05:51.913 --> 05:54.207
Come on. Let's get our car. Quick!

06:04.843 --> 06:05.802
Hey, what are you doing?

06:07.762 --> 06:09.222
Stop! What the hell...

06:09.556 --> 06:11.850
Charlie, slow down! Think!

06:18.940 --> 06:22.694
- What's the big hurry?
- Police. Move it!

06:25.196 --> 06:27.365
Case wants to know
when he can have the Toyota.

06:27.365 --> 06:29.784
- A couple of days.
- I'll tell him.

06:31.244 --> 06:31.995
Oh, wait.

06:33.037 --> 06:34.706
What's the matter, Norm?

06:35.123 --> 06:37.625
I want to leave Mr Case's employment.

06:37.709 --> 06:39.085
We didn't hear that.

06:39.169 --> 06:40.962
I talked to Mr Case about that.

06:40.962 --> 06:42.922
He said no problem. No,
he was as sweet as pie.

06:42.922 --> 06:43.965
You're in deep shit now.

06:44.507 --> 06:47.427
He won't let you go. You
know too much.

06:47.427 --> 06:50.221
Why? Don't you think
I can trust him?

06:55.143 --> 06:56.478
There's only one thing.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.023
I told him you
guys wanted out as well.

07:04.611 --> 07:06.196
You did what?

07:22.128 --> 07:25.882
Ah, Mr Case wants to have
a word with you two, boys.

07:37.143 --> 07:38.311
Hello, Case.

07:40.063 --> 07:41.105
Hi, boys.

07:42.357 --> 07:44.442
Morley said you wanted to see us.

07:45.068 --> 07:46.444
And Morley's right.

07:46.736 --> 07:51.240
Got something for ya.
It's in a car outside.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.160
Oh my God.

07:54.577 --> 07:55.536
Norm...

07:58.957 --> 08:00.416
He died suddenly.

08:00.416 --> 08:04.712
He never even got the last rites
for his last wrongs, Charlie.

08:04.712 --> 08:05.755
What did he die of?

08:05.964 --> 08:08.675
He wanted to work for somebody else.

08:08.675 --> 08:11.177
Aa, natural causes.

08:13.137 --> 08:18.768
I want you to take him for some
special weight training.

08:19.519 --> 08:21.896
First Louie, now Norm.

08:22.230 --> 08:25.233
I mean we were only
talking to him a few hours ago.

08:25.566 --> 08:26.901
I'm very upset, Charlie.

08:27.652 --> 08:29.112
I don't mind admitting it.

08:45.461 --> 08:48.798
We didn't do it. It's not our fault.

08:49.966 --> 08:52.552
If we hadn't done this,
he would have killed us too.

08:51.926 --> 08:56.514
Do you think he won't?
I'm very depressed.

08:56.514 --> 08:59.142
I think I'll go lose some money.

09:00.268 --> 09:02.562
Place your bets.

09:07.567 --> 09:08.526
Number ten - black.

09:14.449 --> 09:16.117
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?

09:19.996 --> 09:21.664
You've got a customer.

09:21.748 --> 09:22.707
Where?

09:22.790 --> 09:23.750
Over there.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.418
Oh, thanks.

09:33.468 --> 09:35.970
Can I get you a drink, sir?

09:36.471 --> 09:37.513
Eh, coffee, please.

09:54.322 --> 09:56.199
Ah, I'm sorry!

09:56.199 --> 09:58.075
Sorry, I'm not wearing my glasses.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.118
I lost them last night.

09:59.410 --> 10:00.161
You can't find them?

10:00.453 --> 10:02.455
Can't find them without them.

10:02.955 --> 10:03.915
What's your name?

10:04.332 --> 10:05.583
Faith.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.126
You are not really good
at this job, are you?

10:07.251 --> 10:10.880
I'm so sorry, Mr Hope.
It won't happen again.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.340
You - that's it!

10:12.673 --> 10:15.051
No, wait. It was my fault.

10:19.347 --> 10:20.264
Thanks.

10:20.598 --> 10:21.641
I need this job.

10:21.933 --> 10:24.018
Do you want me
to get you another coffee?

10:24.018 --> 10:25.061
No, let's not risk it.

10:25.186 --> 10:26.103
OK.

10:26.312 --> 10:28.731
I'm going off duty now.
I've been on the night.

10:28.731 --> 10:30.942
Can you come and have
some breakfast with me?

10:31.150 --> 10:33.444
No, it's nearly time for my day job.

10:33.444 --> 10:35.571
You see, I can't get a grant.

10:35.571 --> 10:37.698
I'm trying to save up
enough to go to college.

10:37.823 --> 10:39.283
Can I have your phone number?

10:39.283 --> 10:41.577
No. Don't know who you are.

10:41.786 --> 10:43.663
OK. Here's mine.

10:43.663 --> 10:47.917
If you ever want anything,
anything at all, just ask for Brian.

10:50.002 --> 10:51.254
It's yours.

10:51.254 --> 10:53.047
Oh, thanks.

10:58.344 --> 11:00.429
That's what you look like!

11:04.183 --> 11:05.643
You see that drinking club?

11:07.019 --> 11:09.522
They found it for
laundring money from crack.

11:07.311 --> 11:10.356
No, we didn't touch drugs.

11:10.856 --> 11:15.778
We don't. It belongs to Triads.
They're moving in from Hong Kong.

11:15.778 --> 11:19.949
We gonna take the real pot again
away from them.

11:20.783 --> 11:21.826
From the Triads?

11:21.826 --> 11:24.829
It's all used notes. There's no risk.

11:24.829 --> 11:27.540
No risk? The Triads?

11:27.540 --> 11:29.125
You want to work for somebody else?

11:29.125 --> 11:30.167
- No.
- No.

11:32.753 --> 11:38.718
Find out where they take the cash.
Watch out for a red Mercedes.

11:57.069 --> 11:58.446
Look.

12:33.147 --> 12:34.106
Watch out.

12:38.694 --> 12:40.029
Vay you folla us?

12:40.029 --> 12:41.071
Hm?

12:41.071 --> 12:42.114
Why you folla us?

12:43.365 --> 12:45.159
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:45.159 --> 12:46.202
You policemen?

12:46.202 --> 12:47.870
Do we look like policemen?

12:47.870 --> 12:48.913
No.

12:48.913 --> 12:49.955
Good.

12:52.333 --> 12:58.589
So, if you folla us again,
I chop your arms off, OK?

13:04.220 --> 13:04.637
Great.

13:06.013 --> 13:08.098
Now, if Case doesn't kill us, the Triads will.

13:09.350 --> 13:12.895
You know what we ought to do?
Steal the money for ourselves.

13:12.895 --> 13:13.938
Oh, brilliant!

13:13.938 --> 13:17.358
Then we'll have Case trying to gun us down
and the Triads trying to chop us up!

13:17.358 --> 13:24.782
No. We grab the money for ourselves,
we drive to the airport, and olé - we're in Rio.

13:27.701 --> 13:29.870
So, what do you want to study?

13:29.870 --> 13:30.913
Psychology.

13:31.789 --> 13:34.166
- Psychology?
- Yeah.

13:35.834 --> 13:38.754
I've got a job at King's
College now. Dreaming.

13:39.171 --> 13:40.005
Dreaming?

13:40.756 --> 13:41.674
It's a job?

13:41.674 --> 13:45.636
Yeah, they pay me. Ten quid an hour.

13:45.970 --> 13:49.181
Practical experience on a real
psychology department.

13:49.181 --> 13:51.475
I've got to go
straight there after breakfast.

13:51.684 --> 13:54.311
And what do you do?
Just go to sleep?

13:54.311 --> 13:56.188
It's not just sleeping.

13:56.397 --> 13:59.400
When I wake up I tell
them what I dreamt.

14:01.277 --> 14:03.696
They are very interested.

14:04.113 --> 14:07.116
I'm supposed to have
some interesting dreams.

14:08.909 --> 14:09.952
I suppose you must have.

15:10.846 --> 15:12.181
This job's great!

15:13.640 --> 15:14.391
Thanks.

15:14.892 --> 15:17.311
That casino was run by
gangsters, you know.

15:17.311 --> 15:18.353
No!

15:18.353 --> 15:19.480
Yes!

15:19.480 --> 15:21.565
What kind of business
are you in, Brian?

15:21.774 --> 15:23.567
Oh, I'm an entrepreneur,

15:23.567 --> 15:27.946
you know, fingers in pies,
banks, shopping centres, cars...

15:27.946 --> 15:28.989
That's brilliant.

15:28.989 --> 15:30.032
Joey.

15:30.866 --> 15:32.534
-You know Faith?
- Yeah, we've met.

15:33.994 --> 15:35.871
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

15:36.288 --> 15:37.539
Are we keeping you up?

15:37.539 --> 15:38.582
Faith's very tired.

15:38.916 --> 15:40.459
She's got an interesting sideline.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.461
She sleeps for ten quid an hour.

15:42.461 --> 15:45.255
Ten quid an hour?!
A good-looking girl like you?

15:45.255 --> 15:46.715
I can give you fifty.

15:47.758 --> 15:48.717
Sows!

15:50.385 --> 15:51.929
So, she must be pretty...

15:53.931 --> 15:54.973
A bit of...

15:56.850 --> 15:57.976
...rather...

15:59.561 --> 16:00.187
What?

16:00.687 --> 16:02.481
She must be a terrific lay.

16:02.481 --> 16:03.607
It's not like that.

16:05.192 --> 16:09.780
We talk, we hold hands,
we kiss - it's nothing.

16:09.780 --> 16:10.823
You're in love with her.

16:11.448 --> 16:14.243
Love! I like it, that's all.
What's wrong with that?

16:14.451 --> 16:16.036
Don't be daft!

16:16.370 --> 16:20.541
You'll see the women in Rio.
They're the most beautiful in the world.

16:20.541 --> 16:21.583
So, we are definitely on then?

16:21.583 --> 16:22.626
Yeah. Aren't we?

16:22.626 --> 16:23.669
Oh yeah.

16:25.128 --> 16:26.672
I'll be sorry to leave Faith.

16:27.714 --> 16:29.383
You can't tell everybody where
we're going.

16:29.383 --> 16:32.928
Now's the time when we
can make a nice clean break of it.

16:33.136 --> 16:34.179
Come on.

16:56.618 --> 16:58.370
They'll be armed,
so we should to kill, right?

16:58.579 --> 16:59.621
Yes, should to kill.

17:00.455 --> 17:01.498
Shut that door!

17:09.339 --> 17:10.799
What about Brian and Charlie?

17:11.633 --> 17:13.719
I don't trust them any more.

17:16.012 --> 17:20.058
I think I'm going to make tomorrow
their last day on this planet.

17:21.226 --> 17:23.311
OK. Here's the shooties.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.273
One for you.

17:29.359 --> 17:30.402
One for you.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.573
One each for Brian and Charlie.

17:35.490 --> 17:36.533
Guns for them?

17:37.284 --> 17:39.995
First, we use them,
then we get rid of them.

17:39.995 --> 17:41.038
Like Kleenex.

17:41.038 --> 17:42.080
Anything else?

17:42.080 --> 17:46.877
- No. The Willis Street, 10:00 am.
- Leave it to us, Case.

18:10.358 --> 18:12.319
Brian, they're going to kill you!

18:12.319 --> 18:13.361
Go away!

18:13.361 --> 18:14.404
I won't let it happen. Come with me.

18:14.404 --> 18:15.447
- Go home!
- Come with me!

18:17.866 --> 18:19.618
I'm trying to commit a major crime.

18:19.826 --> 18:21.620
She's part of the plan?

18:26.708 --> 18:27.876
Get off me!

18:29.544 --> 18:30.587
Get into the car!

18:31.213 --> 18:31.922
Get off me!

18:33.298 --> 18:34.341
Come on...

18:34.341 --> 18:35.383
You stupid cow!

18:35.383 --> 18:38.095
Look at that guy. Henpecked!

18:39.763 --> 18:42.349
Don't move or you're dead!

19:00.075 --> 19:01.326
Let's see!

19:22.806 --> 19:25.225
- Hang on, don't set it.
- Too late. I have set it.

19:25.308 --> 19:26.977
We've got 50 seconds.

19:34.526 --> 19:36.069
Hold it. Don't shoot!

19:36.903 --> 19:37.946
Why not?

19:38.697 --> 19:40.782
Because it's wrong.

19:41.908 --> 19:43.702
It's very funny, Brian.

19:43.702 --> 19:44.744
Don't move!

19:46.204 --> 19:48.081
You shoot them, I'll shoot you.

19:48.582 --> 19:50.166
What did you put in my car?

19:50.166 --> 19:51.209
A bomb!

19:51.209 --> 19:52.252
Are you off your trolley?

19:52.335 --> 19:54.546
Right! Over there with them!

19:54.629 --> 19:55.589
Put your guns down.

19:56.715 --> 19:57.757
You too!

19:59.426 --> 20:00.594
Throw the bags over here.

20:05.890 --> 20:06.725
Wait a minute, what...

20:06.933 --> 20:07.976
You'll regret this!

20:08.393 --> 20:11.938
Right. We've got... six seconds!

20:21.531 --> 20:22.907
Brilliant!

20:44.596 --> 20:46.139
- What's the matter?
- It won't start.

20:46.139 --> 20:48.558
- Why not?
- I don't know.

20:48.892 --> 20:50.435
I don't know what's happened.

20:50.560 --> 20:54.397
Look! We're out of petrol,
you stupid dick!

20:56.399 --> 20:58.360
Quick! We'd better run for it!

21:19.422 --> 21:20.048
Where's Faith?

21:20.173 --> 21:22.967
She's gone. She went by taxi.

21:36.523 --> 21:37.690
That door.

21:37.690 --> 21:39.651
- What about it?
- It's open!

22:05.301 --> 22:06.553
Do you speak English?

22:16.563 --> 22:18.231
What is this place?

22:24.404 --> 22:26.364
Was that a nun?

23:52.617 --> 23:54.160
What we gonna do?

23:54.285 --> 23:58.122
We'll never get to the airport.
The place will be crawling with cops.

24:17.308 --> 24:19.310
Do we have the airline tickets?

24:19.602 --> 24:22.855
- No. Oh, shit. I left them in the car.

24:22.855 --> 24:25.775
Christ! We've got no alternative.

24:27.443 --> 24:29.195
No! What do the nuns do anyway?

24:29.195 --> 24:33.366
Nothing. They sit about,
they read, they pray...

24:33.366 --> 24:37.245
It's a godsend. No one would even
think of looking for us in a nunnery.

24:37.328 --> 24:38.496
We need makeup.

25:00.059 --> 25:04.438
Eh... Miss, how do you put this on?

25:04.480 --> 25:06.440
With the red sponge, sister.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.452
How do I look?

25:18.744 --> 25:19.495
OK.

25:20.621 --> 25:21.664
OK.

25:24.709 --> 25:25.334
OK.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.257
Excuse me.

25:32.508 --> 25:34.510
Do nuns usually wear makeup?

25:35.219 --> 25:36.679
It's our day off.

25:42.310 --> 25:44.937
If we're good nuns,
God will see us through.

25:44.937 --> 25:45.980
We're not nuns, Charlie!

25:45.980 --> 25:49.317
From now on we are. Say nothing.

25:51.694 --> 25:52.320
Yes?

25:52.737 --> 25:56.282
Hello. We're from Chipping Sodbury.
We believe you are expecting us.

25:56.490 --> 25:57.325
No.

25:57.533 --> 25:58.367
No?

25:58.576 --> 25:59.410
No!

25:59.827 --> 26:01.287
Can we come in?

26:02.455 --> 26:05.166
Well..., I suppose so.

26:07.043 --> 26:09.003
See? It's a pushover.

26:09.962 --> 26:11.631
Come in.

26:13.633 --> 26:14.967
I'm a superior.

26:15.176 --> 26:16.218
Sister Liz is my name.

26:16.218 --> 26:17.803
Good morning Reverend Mother.

26:18.512 --> 26:21.140
We don't use titles like
Reverend Mother any more.

26:21.140 --> 26:23.309
Just call me 'sister'.
What is your name?

26:23.726 --> 26:27.480
Sister Inviolata of the Immaculate Conception.

26:28.856 --> 26:30.107
And yours?

26:32.693 --> 26:35.738
Sister Euphemia of the Five Wounds.

26:35.946 --> 26:36.989
Five Wounds?!

26:38.032 --> 26:41.160
Five Wounds, for short.

26:44.914 --> 26:46.582
Do sit down.

26:49.293 --> 26:52.505
I gather you thought
we were expecting you.

26:53.130 --> 26:56.050
Yes! Yes. Eh... Did the
documentation not arrive?

26:56.050 --> 26:57.093
What documentation?

26:57.093 --> 27:00.971
From my Mother Superior. The letters
she sent to introduce us.

27:00.971 --> 27:02.014
I don't recall such a letter.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.392
Still you are very welcome.

27:04.392 --> 27:07.228
As you know, we run
a teacher training college

27:07.228 --> 27:09.939
in this convent for 18-22 year-old girls...

27:09.939 --> 27:10.981
You do?

27:10.981 --> 27:12.024
You have experience?

27:12.233 --> 27:15.069
Of 18-year-old girls? Yes, plenty.

27:15.277 --> 27:18.406
Well, welcome to our convent.

27:18.406 --> 27:21.325
I'll just find someone
to show you round.

27:26.539 --> 27:27.581
Thank you.

27:30.501 --> 27:32.253
Where did you get those names?

27:32.378 --> 27:35.589
From auntie Mary, because she's a nun.

27:35.714 --> 27:36.632
You'll never get away with this.

27:36.549 --> 27:40.386
Brian! This is our only chance to go straight.

27:40.386 --> 27:43.848
You call all this - going straight?

27:46.350 --> 27:48.936
Mr Norris, could you spare
sister Mary for a few moments?

27:49.061 --> 27:52.481
But we order the accounts
for the drug rehabilitation clinic.

27:52.481 --> 27:53.524
You go ahead.

27:59.697 --> 28:01.240
- Listen, you can't leave.
- Why not?

28:01.365 --> 28:04.076
- For lots of reasons.
- Name three.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.662
Case, the Triads, the Police.

28:06.787 --> 28:10.958
This is sister Mary of the Annunciation.
She will take you to your cells.

28:13.335 --> 28:14.295
Cells?

28:15.838 --> 28:17.506
This is the residential area,

28:19.091 --> 28:21.886
and the college
is through the door.

28:39.445 --> 28:43.073
This is your room. Yours,
sister Inviolata, is next door.

28:44.116 --> 28:46.118
The bathroom is at the end of the corridor.

28:46.118 --> 28:48.621
We all share bathrooms and showers, of course.

28:48.621 --> 28:51.832
- Not literally?
- What's the matter with that?

28:51.832 --> 28:53.417
Ehm... our orders are very modest.

28:54.043 --> 28:56.629
We don't tolerate nudity
in any shape or form.

28:56.629 --> 28:57.671
Especially our shape.

28:58.213 --> 29:03.302
Yes. We believe it's a sin to show
our private parts of the body in public.

29:03.302 --> 29:04.887
Not to ours surely.

29:05.095 --> 29:09.058
We are all just the same underneath
when you get right down to it.

29:09.141 --> 29:10.100
Well..., Well, yes...

29:10.100 --> 29:13.020
We couldn't possibly break
our rules, could we? No.

29:13.020 --> 29:16.148
And I'm sure you understand
that, sister Mary of the Annunciation.

29:16.148 --> 29:19.568
And we'd like you to explain it
to the sister superior.

29:19.568 --> 29:20.611
Why me?

29:22.613 --> 29:24.490
Why did you ask her to explain it?

29:24.490 --> 29:27.201
It's her job, isn't it? Annunciation.

29:27.284 --> 29:28.953
Isn't it a classy work for announcement?

29:28.953 --> 29:33.248
Yes - if you are the Angel of the Lord
and you are declaring to the Virgin Mary

29:33.248 --> 29:37.294
she's about to conceive by the Holy Ghost
and have an immaculate conception.

29:37.336 --> 29:40.005
But not, Brian, not because
you want a private shower,

29:40.047 --> 29:41.090
because you are pretending to be a nun

29:41.090 --> 29:45.052
and you're frightened the other
nuns might see your dick!

29:45.052 --> 29:48.681
Now, keep your mouth shut until you
can say something suitable.

29:48.889 --> 29:50.557
How do I know what's suitable?

29:50.557 --> 29:53.477
I've never been a f...g nun before!

29:53.477 --> 29:55.771
I just hate to hear you blaspheme.

29:55.979 --> 29:57.564
Wait a minute, Charlie.

29:57.564 --> 30:02.861
Just because you're dressed like a nun,
it doesn't mean you are one!

30:04.321 --> 30:06.740
- And you can't describe any of them?
- No.

30:06.740 --> 30:10.994
- I broke my glasses. See?
- I see. Thank you, miss.

30:10.994 --> 30:12.788
What happened to your arm?

30:12.788 --> 30:16.333
- I think I was shot.
- Oh yes. It should be attended to.

30:16.333 --> 30:18.919
I can't hear you, you are breaking up!

30:22.798 --> 30:26.969
- Well, shall I help you unpack...
- I'll manage, thank you.

30:33.517 --> 30:36.562
Why do you still wear
those old fashion habits?

30:36.562 --> 30:38.105
Most of us have given them up.

30:38.105 --> 30:41.984
Well, erm... We'd rather not, actually.

30:41.984 --> 30:44.153
They're for a... for travelling.

30:44.153 --> 30:47.614
You couldn't lend us something
more like you are wearing, could you?

30:48.657 --> 30:51.160
It's so much more faminine.

30:51.160 --> 30:55.122
We've got loads of stuff
for you in the basement.

30:55.330 --> 30:57.124
I'll lend you one of mine.

31:02.629 --> 31:03.672
Why?

31:03.672 --> 31:07.217
Because we need to look just like them
if we want to pass unnoticed.

31:12.014 --> 31:13.056
Then what happened?

31:13.056 --> 31:14.099
We don't know.

31:14.933 --> 31:15.976
Where did they go?

31:16.185 --> 31:16.935
We don't know.

31:17.644 --> 31:19.438
Where did the girl go?

31:19.438 --> 31:20.481
We don't know.

31:20.981 --> 31:22.983
Why did they abandon the car?

31:22.983 --> 31:24.109
We don't know.

31:27.863 --> 31:29.323
Listen carefully.

31:29.865 --> 31:33.202
I want that money.
I want that girl alive.

31:33.202 --> 31:35.287
To find out what she knows.

31:35.287 --> 31:38.207
And I want Brian and Charlie...

31:38.207 --> 31:39.958
dead!

31:40.918 --> 31:42.169
Is that quite clear?

31:59.978 --> 32:01.355
Oi!

32:04.149 --> 32:05.234
Oi! You!

32:11.782 --> 32:12.824
Are you a nun?

32:13.033 --> 32:15.118
Oh, very funny. What do you want?

32:26.088 --> 32:28.173
And this is our chapel.

32:28.173 --> 32:29.216
Hello, sisters.

32:30.133 --> 32:31.593
I'm father Seamus.

32:31.927 --> 32:34.429
Well, Mary. Aren't
you going to introduce us?

32:34.429 --> 32:37.849
This is sister Euphemia
and this is sister Inviolata.

32:38.058 --> 32:39.226
They're staying here.

32:39.226 --> 32:40.268
Very nice.

32:40.477 --> 32:41.520
How long are you staying?

32:42.854 --> 32:45.565
I'm very pleased to meet you,
sister Euphemia.

32:45.899 --> 32:48.068
If there's anything
at all I can do for you,

32:48.193 --> 32:52.030
don't hesitate to
call on me, day or night.

32:55.367 --> 32:56.618
What did he mean?

32:56.827 --> 32:59.121
Father Seamus can't
keep his hands to himself.

32:59.121 --> 33:02.165
Father, father, be off with you.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.668
That's disgusting!

33:05.085 --> 33:09.131
You should be flattered. He didn't
give me a second glance.

33:13.301 --> 33:16.638
So, I hear you are from Chipping Sodbury.

33:16.638 --> 33:17.723
Yes.

33:18.014 --> 33:19.891
I've been meaning to phone old Pearson.

33:20.100 --> 33:20.934
Who?

33:20.934 --> 33:25.105
Father Pearson. Your priest.
We were students together.

33:30.736 --> 33:31.778
What's the matter?

33:33.572 --> 33:35.741
Don't mention Pearson
in front of Euphemia.

33:36.158 --> 33:38.577
They had a little... romance.

33:39.619 --> 33:40.871
A naughty one.

33:41.788 --> 33:43.039
With Pearson?

33:44.291 --> 33:45.876
Don't try to ring him.

33:46.501 --> 33:52.132
He took a vow of silence and left
Chipping Sodbury for unknown destination.

33:57.137 --> 34:00.474
Sister Euphemia, I understand.

34:00.974 --> 34:02.434
But if you need any consolation...

34:03.059 --> 34:06.188
We don't need your
sort of consolation, Father Seamus.

34:06.188 --> 34:09.107
We've heard all about you
from father Pearson.

34:09.315 --> 34:10.484
I don't know what you mean.

34:11.610 --> 34:13.487
I don't like the way you
are looking at me.

34:13.695 --> 34:15.572
I'm not looking at you anywhere.

34:15.572 --> 34:18.492
I admit I enjoy women's company.

34:18.492 --> 34:20.702
There's nothing wrong
with that I hope, sister?

34:20.911 --> 34:21.953
We're not women.

34:23.121 --> 34:24.456
We're nuns!

34:24.456 --> 34:27.167
We don't even think of
ourselves as women at all.

34:27.708 --> 34:28.752
Oh, that's a pity...

34:29.043 --> 34:31.045
if I may say so.

34:37.092 --> 34:40.096
Apparently there's been a bomb
and some shooting in the street.

34:40.096 --> 34:41.681
I don't suppose you've seen
anything unusual?

34:41.973 --> 34:43.433
Strange men, you mean?

34:43.558 --> 34:44.476
Have you?

34:44.809 --> 34:45.518
Well, erm...

34:46.061 --> 34:49.063
All men are a little strange to us, officer.

34:49.063 --> 34:50.106
Excuse me.

34:52.943 --> 34:54.485
What exactly are you looking for?

34:54.819 --> 34:55.527
We don't know.

34:56.071 --> 34:56.905
Was there...

34:57.322 --> 34:58.782
Was there anything stolen?

34:59.407 --> 35:00.533
We don't know.

35:01.576 --> 35:04.621
Well, we're all rather busy today.

35:05.038 --> 35:07.624
Why don't I just talk
to all the other sisters?

35:07.624 --> 35:09.709
And if you can tell us
who or what you are looking for,

35:09.834 --> 35:11.503
we will tell you if we've seen it.

35:11.711 --> 35:12.462
Thank you.

35:14.422 --> 35:19.552
Oh, Mary, I'm afraid you and I
must have a little talk, by the way.

35:20.053 --> 35:21.304
Excuse us.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.728
So far, so good.

35:28.937 --> 35:31.731
Why did you choose Chipping Sodbury?
There is a convent there!

35:31.731 --> 35:32.774
I didn't know that.

35:33.608 --> 35:37.988
Sister Liz, I've got to give the girls their
Religious Studies class in fifteen minutes.

35:37.988 --> 35:40.407
Sit down, please. I'm supposed
to be teaching as well,

35:40.490 --> 35:43.326
but I'm sorry to say
this is a little more important.

35:43.952 --> 35:46.538
I'll find someone else
to take the classes.

36:00.927 --> 36:04.180
Oh, Euphemia. I have to talk
to sister Mary here.

36:04.389 --> 36:07.726
Would you take her Religious Studies
class for 3rd-year girls?

36:07.809 --> 36:10.437
- Me?
- Yes, in quarter of an hour?

36:10.854 --> 36:11.980
I don't think I know how.

36:12.313 --> 36:14.816
Now, now, no false modesty please.

36:15.108 --> 36:17.193
The sin of pride, remember?

36:17.527 --> 36:20.030
It's not false modesty.

36:20.238 --> 36:21.156
You don't have
to stick to the curriculum,

36:21.281 --> 36:24.075
it's more like a religious discussion group.

36:24.075 --> 36:26.578
I'm sure they'd be interested
to hear your point of view.

36:26.828 --> 36:28.705
I'm sure they would.

36:30.665 --> 36:32.125
Well... What about her?

36:33.168 --> 36:34.753
She's just hanging about.

36:35.044 --> 36:39.007
I'm retired. I'm not going back
to work now, thank you very much.

36:39.007 --> 36:44.637
Euphemia, just talk to the girls and answer
their questions about the Trinity.

36:46.723 --> 36:47.766
The Trinity?

36:49.768 --> 36:52.979
I think sister Inviolata would be
much better at it than me.

36:53.188 --> 36:55.190
No, er... No. We're just going out.

36:55.190 --> 36:56.232
Where to?

36:56.232 --> 36:58.610
Oh, we just love exercise.

37:01.946 --> 37:03.948
They are a strange pair!

37:04.157 --> 37:08.328
Yes. And now we've got
another blooming visitor.

37:16.753 --> 37:18.421
They won't search a couple of nuns?

37:18.963 --> 37:22.592
What? With suitcases? After a bomb?

37:29.057 --> 37:31.559
So, are you going to tell the police?

37:31.893 --> 37:34.187
I don't know. I must think about it.

37:34.187 --> 37:36.898
But you must meditate upon
your weakness and pray for strength.

37:36.981 --> 37:39.067
And you'd better take a week off.

37:39.817 --> 37:40.944
We came back.

37:41.277 --> 37:43.988
We thought God wanted us to help.

37:44.197 --> 37:45.782
Yes. Who knows?

37:47.742 --> 37:50.161
Since you are so fond of
exercise, sister Inviolata,

37:50.161 --> 37:53.373
you could take my freshman girls
Physical Education class.

37:53.498 --> 37:55.375
You look as if you could do
with the workout.

37:55.375 --> 37:57.126
This young lady says
she wants to be a teacher.

37:57.335 --> 37:58.586
I can't think why.

37:59.754 --> 38:00.797
Let's go.

38:03.508 --> 38:06.928
And do put your suitcases
in your cells for goodness sake!

38:07.053 --> 38:07.971
What's she doing here?

38:08.096 --> 38:09.013
Looking for you?

38:09.013 --> 38:10.056
I wanna talk to her.

38:10.265 --> 38:12.350
You've gone out your mind!

38:12.767 --> 38:15.270
We're not interviewing
applicants at the moment.

38:15.270 --> 38:17.146
No, can I just talk to you?

38:17.272 --> 38:20.275
I am a mature student, and a Catholic.

38:22.485 --> 38:23.736
OK.

38:29.993 --> 38:31.452
- Let me out!
- No!

38:31.452 --> 38:33.538
- I want to talk to Faith.
- You can't.

38:35.206 --> 38:37.292
She can't know we're here.
She can't know we're nuns!

38:37.292 --> 38:38.334
Why not?

38:38.459 --> 38:39.377
What if Abbot and Morley find her?

38:39.502 --> 38:42.505
What if Case tortures her?
She'll tell!

38:42.505 --> 38:44.090
I'll take that chance.

38:44.090 --> 38:45.133
No!

38:45.133 --> 38:48.761
And think of her - if she knows
nothing, she's safe.

38:51.055 --> 38:52.432
Do the class in fifteen minutes.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.474
OK.

38:55.560 --> 38:56.602
Explain the Trinity.

38:57.937 --> 39:00.231
Hm... That's a bit of a bugger.

39:03.067 --> 39:06.821
It can't be that difficult.
You've been a Catholic all your life.

39:07.113 --> 39:08.072
Yeah.

39:09.741 --> 39:12.118
Well, here's the pitch.

39:14.203 --> 39:16.080
You've  got the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

39:16.497 --> 39:21.085
The three are one - like a shamrock,
my old priest used to say.

39:21.419 --> 39:22.545
"Three leaves but one leaf."

39:23.921 --> 39:26.424
Now, the father sent down the son,
who was love,

39:26.507 --> 39:29.969
and then when he went away,
he sent down the holy spirit,

39:30.053 --> 39:31.512
who came down in the form of a...

39:31.637 --> 39:32.972
You told me already - a ghost.

39:33.014 --> 39:34.015
No, a dove.

39:34.057 --> 39:37.477
- The dove was a ghost?
- No, the ghost was a dove.

39:37.602 --> 39:42.899
Let me try and summarize this:
God is his son. And his son is God.

39:43.107 --> 39:48.237
But his son moonlights as a holy
ghost, a holy spirit, and a dove.

39:48.321 --> 39:50.198
And they all send each other,

39:50.323 --> 39:53.117
even though they're all
one and the same thing.

39:53.326 --> 39:54.160
You've got it!

39:54.160 --> 39:55.203
What?

39:55.536 --> 39:56.662
You really could be a nun!

39:56.662 --> 39:57.705
Thanks.

39:59.290 --> 40:00.541
Wait a minute.

40:00.750 --> 40:03.461
What I said, does make
any sense to you?

40:03.461 --> 40:04.504
Oh, no.

40:06.464 --> 40:08.466
No. That makes no sense to anybody.

40:08.674 --> 40:09.967
That's why you have to believe it.

40:10.176 --> 40:11.469
That's why you have to have faith.

40:11.677 --> 40:15.348
If it made sense, it wouldn't have
to be a religion, would it?

40:17.725 --> 40:21.062
I'd be happy to consider you
if you pass your exams.

40:21.062 --> 40:22.104
Thank you.

40:22.855 --> 40:25.775
Can I just have a quick look
round before I go?

40:25.983 --> 40:27.109
Not at the moment I'm afraid.

40:27.652 --> 40:29.946
Well, I wish you luck, Faith.
Work hard.

40:36.953 --> 40:38.830
No, no, look.

40:38.913 --> 40:39.872
I've told you.

40:40.081 --> 40:42.250
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.

40:43.084 --> 40:45.503
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.

40:45.586 --> 40:46.629
That's easy.

40:49.757 --> 40:51.842
I'm enjoying this. Nice.

40:52.176 --> 40:52.885
Nice?!

40:54.679 --> 40:57.265
Look, Charlie. Some con men
sell life insurance.

40:57.598 --> 41:01.352
The church sells afterlife insurance.
It's brilliant!

41:01.644 --> 41:04.480
Everyone thinks you might need it,
and no one can prove you don't.

41:04.689 --> 41:06.857
The church isn't selling anything, Brian.

41:07.066 --> 41:09.277
Oh! Well, if the church
isn't selling anything,

41:09.360 --> 41:11.571
how did it get to be so rich?

41:11.779 --> 41:15.116
Just remember, wherever
there's a deep human need,

41:15.324 --> 41:16.784
there's money to be made.

41:16.993 --> 41:17.827
You think so?

41:17.827 --> 41:20.121
Of course, look at Kentucky
Fried Chicken.

41:20.329 --> 41:23.541
Is that what you are saying God
wanted the Church to be? Rich?

41:23.874 --> 41:27.503
No. God is very busy. He can't
control all the details.

41:27.712 --> 41:30.548
He's running a franchise operation.

41:32.967 --> 41:34.510
Those nuns aren't rich.

41:34.719 --> 41:35.553
Come on. Let's go.

41:40.766 --> 41:43.185
Good people, Brian.
Anyone can see that.

41:43.269 --> 41:44.854
Just like me and you and other monks.

41:45.146 --> 41:46.605
How come they're happier than us?

41:46.605 --> 41:49.442
They're only happier than us
because when they joined the thing

41:49.525 --> 41:51.319
they checked their brains at the door!

41:55.906 --> 41:56.949
What happened to your arm?

41:57.158 --> 41:59.535
I'm not sure. I fell.

41:59.869 --> 42:02.163
It looks like a bullet wound to me.

42:03.289 --> 42:04.540
How would you know?

42:04.540 --> 42:06.625
I've seen bullet wounds.
I've been a missionary.

42:06.625 --> 42:07.668
Where?

42:08.002 --> 42:09.253
East L. A.

42:21.140 --> 42:23.017
Come on, girls.

42:23.309 --> 42:24.560
Let's play ball.

42:33.027 --> 42:36.155
...And I don't think we need
to discuss the Trinity any more.

42:36.155 --> 42:37.198
But what I don't understand

42:37.281 --> 42:41.285
is how can be God both
a spirit and a man?

42:41.368 --> 42:44.080
But He's also a dove,
don't forget that.

42:44.205 --> 42:47.333
- Isn't that a metaphor?
- No, it's a bird.

42:47.541 --> 42:49.418
What's the big deal
about Him suffering on earth

42:49.502 --> 42:52.630
if He knew He was going
to rejoin His Father in Heaven?

42:53.464 --> 42:57.551
Look, Tracey. Do you think
it is easy to be God's son?

42:57.635 --> 42:59.095
Let me tell you, young lady,

42:59.095 --> 43:02.973
it is never easy to be the son
of a successful father.

43:03.057 --> 43:04.016
- But...

43:04.016 --> 43:07.645
- Look! All you need to
know about the Trinity is this.

43:07.645 --> 43:10.481
God is like a shamrock!

43:12.149 --> 43:14.652
Small, green and split three ways.

43:14.652 --> 43:15.694
Class dismissed.

43:33.003 --> 43:35.381
Dribble, girls, dribble...
Pass the ball.

43:35.714 --> 43:36.215
Thank you.

44:03.325 --> 44:04.994
That's what you do.

44:34.732 --> 44:35.774
Hi, Faith.

44:38.068 --> 44:39.111
Who's that?

44:39.111 --> 44:40.446
It's me, Brian.

44:41.196 --> 44:43.365
Oh, Brian...

44:46.910 --> 44:48.829
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

44:48.829 --> 44:51.624
Did you see us come in?
Did anyone else?

44:51.624 --> 44:52.666
I don't think so.

44:52.666 --> 44:53.709
I wish you hadn't followed us.

44:53.709 --> 44:55.169
Thanks a lot!

44:55.294 --> 44:57.796
No, it's for your own safety.

44:58.005 --> 45:01.216
Look. You haven't seen me,
you didn't see me come in here,

45:01.342 --> 45:03.010
you don't know I'm here, all right?

45:03.218 --> 45:04.053
OK.

45:04.553 --> 45:06.555
What's the matter with your arm?

45:06.555 --> 45:10.184
Oh, it's nothing. I'm just a bit dizzy.
Can you stay with me for a bit?

45:10.184 --> 45:14.146
No, no. I mean if the nuns find me,
they'll tell the police.

45:14.271 --> 45:15.189
I see.

45:16.357 --> 45:19.360
Besides..., I don't want us to get too involved.

45:19.902 --> 45:23.447
Let's face it, we're not
serious about each other, are we?

45:23.530 --> 45:24.490
Well, no, but...

45:24.490 --> 45:26.367
Look, Faith. We're gangsters.

45:26.367 --> 45:29.787
We're in an ugly business.
We mean ugly people, all right?

45:29.912 --> 45:31.872
You shouldn't hate yourself like this.

45:31.872 --> 45:33.874
You saved those men's lives.

45:33.874 --> 45:36.377
You could change decent and decent.

45:36.377 --> 45:37.419
Go straight.

45:37.419 --> 45:39.505
It's not that easy.

45:39.505 --> 45:41.507
Anyway, what's it matter to you?

45:41.590 --> 45:44.009
It's not like we were married or anything.

45:44.093 --> 45:46.512
Oh, wait a minute. I've never
suggested we get married.

45:46.595 --> 45:50.057
Oh, just as well, because... I'm not available.

45:50.682 --> 45:54.019
That's why I had
to find you to tell you.

45:54.436 --> 45:56.522
You're telling me you are married?

45:56.522 --> 45:59.525
Yeah! That's it. I'm married.

46:00.150 --> 46:02.361
Sorry, I should have mentioned it.

46:02.361 --> 46:04.863
Too bloody right, why didn't you?

46:04.738 --> 46:07.783
I only just thought of it. I only
just thought of telling you it.

46:08.283 --> 46:12.246
An ugly married gangster!
I really do pick'em.

46:12.246 --> 46:13.831
What do you mean "ugly"?

46:14.039 --> 46:15.582
You said you were ugly.

46:15.582 --> 46:18.418
Yeah, but I didn't expect
such a wholehearted agreement.

46:18.418 --> 46:23.423
I meant not like ugly with
your nose all over your face.

46:24.049 --> 46:26.009
Oh, God. Where's my wimple?

46:35.018 --> 46:37.521
Oh, what are you doing here?

46:37.729 --> 46:40.023
Er..., just visiting.

46:40.649 --> 46:42.401
- I'll take this.
- Thanks.

46:49.908 --> 46:50.868
She's gone.

46:51.076 --> 46:52.828
Didn't they see you?

46:52.828 --> 46:55.038
- They?
- Those two nuns.

46:55.038 --> 46:59.209
Err..., no. No, I was..., I was hiding.

46:59.293 --> 47:01.295
Right. I'll be off, then.

47:01.378 --> 47:02.337
Fine.

47:03.380 --> 47:06.383
I'm going now to the church
for confession.

47:06.383 --> 47:09.094
Ah. That makes everything OK, does it?

47:09.303 --> 47:10.137
In a way.

47:13.181 --> 47:14.224
Lucky you.

47:15.350 --> 47:17.019
I never wanna see you again.

47:30.991 --> 47:34.036
Sister Inviolata, you play great
game of balls. How come?

47:34.953 --> 47:37.664
I wasn't always a nun, my dear.

47:37.873 --> 47:39.333
Are there any other games you are good at?

47:39.875 --> 47:40.500
Yes.

47:41.752 --> 47:43.295
But I can't play them with you.

47:44.755 --> 47:46.840
Aren't you going to take a shower?

47:46.840 --> 47:49.176
No, no. I'm very shy.

47:49.885 --> 47:51.678
Sister Inviolata.

47:51.887 --> 47:53.138
Are you in here?

47:53.764 --> 47:54.473
Yes!

47:55.641 --> 47:57.517
Oh, listen. I...

48:02.397 --> 48:03.231
Oh...

48:04.483 --> 48:06.276
What's wrong, sister?

48:07.736 --> 48:11.073
Nothing. I just... came over a bit... funny.

48:14.201 --> 48:15.118
It's so...

48:16.370 --> 48:17.829
steamy in here.

48:17.829 --> 48:21.792
Yes, it's certainly is...

48:22.209 --> 48:23.877
steamy.

48:29.841 --> 48:31.718
What are you doing in here?

48:32.636 --> 48:34.096
I can't help myself.

48:36.098 --> 48:37.974
Stop it! Look at me!

48:39.226 --> 48:41.728
You shouldn't be in here.
It's not right.

48:41.812 --> 48:42.771
I know.

48:42.771 --> 48:45.148
I don't understand.
Why shouldn't you be here?

48:45.690 --> 48:47.776
Erm... we don't belong.

48:48.402 --> 48:50.070
You certainly do.

48:50.153 --> 48:53.740
Listen, today is my birthday
and the girls give me a party.

48:53.740 --> 48:55.283
Would you both like to come?

48:55.283 --> 48:56.868
We'd love to. Where is it?

48:56.952 --> 48:58.120
In our bedroom.

48:58.203 --> 48:59.871
Yes. We will be there.

49:07.379 --> 49:11.133
Why have you been carrying the bags
with you all the time?

49:11.133 --> 49:12.592
Because they're very precious to us.

49:12.717 --> 49:15.095
In this order we're not
allowed personal possessions.

49:15.220 --> 49:19.391
Nor are we. But what's in here
does not belong to us. Truthfully.

49:19.391 --> 49:22.185
No, but we're obliged to take care of it.

49:22.185 --> 49:25.230
Whatever it is, it'll be quite
safe over there, with sister Mary.

49:25.313 --> 49:27.941
She's quite right.
I'll look after them for you.

49:28.233 --> 49:30.026
Now, put them down!

49:40.745 --> 49:42.539
And then at lunch.

49:56.511 --> 49:57.220
Oh, I...

49:58.054 --> 50:00.473
spoke to Faith.
She's in the sickroom.

50:00.557 --> 50:01.933
So now she knows you are here.

50:01.933 --> 50:04.227
No, no. She thinks I've gone now.

50:04.227 --> 50:05.687
I told her I was married.

50:05.979 --> 50:06.938
You were married.

50:07.147 --> 50:08.607
She thinks I still am.

50:10.066 --> 50:11.651
She never wants to see me again.

50:13.194 --> 50:15.071
Huh, just as well.

50:15.906 --> 50:19.451
Oh, you're kidding.
You are in love with her.

50:21.745 --> 50:22.913
I AM, aren't I?

50:25.081 --> 50:27.500
But she doesn't love me.

50:28.335 --> 50:29.461
Charlie,

50:30.003 --> 50:31.880
she said she was gonna confess.

50:31.880 --> 50:32.923
Who?

50:33.006 --> 50:33.965
Faith.

50:33.965 --> 50:35.008
To the cops?

50:35.091 --> 50:36.051
To the priest.

50:36.051 --> 50:40.013
She'll talk about the Triad robbery,
she'll name Case, then us.

50:40.013 --> 50:40.931
Don't panic.

50:41.139 --> 50:44.059
Priests never tell anyone what they
hear in the confessional.

50:44.184 --> 50:47.187
What if he tells her to go to the police?

51:29.938 --> 51:31.731
As soon as he leaves, you go in.

51:31.815 --> 51:33.483
- Me?
- Someone's got to do it.

51:33.483 --> 51:36.194
Don't worry. She's the one
who'll be talking.

51:41.408 --> 51:43.493
- Hello, sister.
- Hello, ...Seamus.

51:43.493 --> 51:47.163
Is there somewhere nice and quiet
where we can have a little talk?

51:47.163 --> 51:48.206
Oh, certainly, sister.

52:06.558 --> 52:11.688
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's three years since my last confession.

52:11.688 --> 52:14.274
O dear, o dear, o dear!

52:16.276 --> 52:22.532
I am... I haven't been living a very good life.
And I think God is punishing me for it.

52:22.740 --> 52:25.243
I've become involved with
a gangster called Brian.

52:25.452 --> 52:27.620
Could you tell me about it?

52:29.622 --> 52:32.750
I... I have lustful feelings about him.

52:34.002 --> 52:35.044
You do?

52:35.545 --> 52:36.379
Yes.

52:36.796 --> 52:38.173
I think I love him.

52:39.841 --> 52:41.384
You love him?

52:42.010 --> 52:43.261
He's so brave.

52:43.469 --> 52:46.514
He prevented a gang murder today.

52:46.514 --> 52:48.892
Oh love, he sounds great.

52:49.726 --> 52:52.145
He says he doesn't love me.

52:52.562 --> 52:56.524
Perhaps he's just saying that
for some reason.

52:56.941 --> 52:59.444
He's a married man.

52:59.444 --> 53:02.113
But when we kissed I felt...

53:02.322 --> 53:04.741
I felt all warmed and funny inside.

53:05.909 --> 53:07.452
I can't describe it.

53:07.493 --> 53:08.494
But my problem is,

53:08.745 --> 53:12.916
there's a terrible crime committed today
and I haven't told the police.

53:13.416 --> 53:16.461
If you love him, keep your trap shut.

53:30.099 --> 53:33.853
I wondered if you'd like
to talk about your...

53:34.187 --> 53:35.647
desires.

53:38.024 --> 53:39.275
Funny,
very funny.

53:40.026 --> 53:42.946
Father Pearson told me that you
had to keep your hands to yourself.

53:42.946 --> 53:45.531
I'm a man. That's why I flirt a little.

53:46.074 --> 53:48.660
Hm, well, I'm not that sort of nun.

53:51.496 --> 53:52.330
Tell me -

53:52.747 --> 53:57.335
- is celibacy just as difficult
for a woman as it is for a man?

53:57.543 --> 53:58.670
I wouldn't know.

53:59.003 --> 54:00.755
I must come clean, though. I...

54:02.131 --> 54:04.842
...I had a man in my bed last night.

54:04.926 --> 54:05.969
All night.

54:05.969 --> 54:07.971
You see, the way I see it...

54:08.179 --> 54:09.013
Sex is allowed.

54:10.765 --> 54:13.685
No, no. It's the doctrine of original sin.

54:14.727 --> 54:17.980
You see, we're all born
sinful, except for Jesus,

54:17.980 --> 54:19.649
who was perfect, of course.

54:19.857 --> 54:22.068
And He was sent to save us.

54:22.568 --> 54:26.030
But how could He save us
unless we were sinning?

54:26.531 --> 54:30.284
So we have to go on sinning
in order to be saved and go to heaven.

54:30.493 --> 54:32.286
That's how Christianity works.

54:32.787 --> 54:34.872
That's why it suits so many people.

54:36.249 --> 54:38.209
And I lied to the police about him.

54:38.626 --> 54:40.920
Purely from the best motives.

54:40.920 --> 54:46.342
So is it true that if you commit a sin out of fear
it is not necessarily a sin after all?

54:47.593 --> 54:49.262
Sounds right to me.

54:50.638 --> 54:52.306
OK. Thanks for dropping by.

54:53.433 --> 54:55.935
Aren't you gonna give
me absolution for my sins?

54:55.935 --> 54:56.978
Oh, absolutely!

54:57.311 --> 55:00.022
You're absolutely absoluted.

55:00.440 --> 55:03.651
That's it. You're done now. You can go.

55:03.651 --> 55:06.904
Aren't you gonna tell me my sins are forgiven?

55:07.196 --> 55:09.490
Erm... I was just coming to that.

55:09.490 --> 55:12.118
I resolve you...
Absolve you!

55:12.201 --> 55:15.246
In the name of the Holy Father,
and of the Son,

55:15.329 --> 55:17.748
and of the holy shamrock.
...Spirit!

55:17.748 --> 55:18.374
Sorry.

55:20.126 --> 55:22.462
Go in peace. Your sins are forgiven you.

55:22.462 --> 55:23.504
Thank you, Father.

55:23.588 --> 55:24.547
You're welcome.

55:41.439 --> 55:42.273
She loves me.

55:43.608 --> 55:45.401
Look, I've got to go to Brazil, forever!

55:46.444 --> 55:47.987
Never mind that.

55:48.321 --> 55:50.281
What do you mean 'never mind that'?

55:50.615 --> 55:52.283
It's a catastrophe!

55:52.700 --> 55:54.368
Maybe I can stay here somehow.

55:54.660 --> 55:57.079
Listen! We have to leave!

55:57.079 --> 56:01.042
Either on a plane to Brazil,
or feet first!

56:13.846 --> 56:15.431
She went over to the church.

56:15.640 --> 56:16.682
She didn't come back?

56:16.891 --> 56:18.351
She said she would.

56:19.393 --> 56:21.270
Can we have our bags, please?

56:21.479 --> 56:23.981
I've put them away in a
nice safe place.

56:24.190 --> 56:25.024
Good.

56:26.067 --> 56:27.109
Where?

56:29.612 --> 56:30.738
Oh, I forget.

56:35.034 --> 56:37.411
Oh, over there, in that cupboard.

56:49.423 --> 56:51.300
It... it won't open.

56:51.634 --> 56:53.511
Of course not. It's locked.

56:53.511 --> 56:54.553
Give us the f...

56:55.179 --> 56:57.348
Could we have the key, please?

56:57.348 --> 56:58.391
Certainly.

57:00.184 --> 57:01.519
But where have I put it?

57:03.396 --> 57:05.398
Can you believe that?

57:06.315 --> 57:07.358
Luckily, I kept some aside.

57:10.820 --> 57:11.946
We have to do some shopping.

57:13.406 --> 57:14.991
Maybe Faith went home?

57:16.117 --> 57:19.453
Charlie, we'll go and warn her
before she gets into trouble.

57:21.122 --> 57:21.956
Who are you?

57:22.081 --> 57:22.915
Who are you?

57:22.915 --> 57:23.958
Who's hot our monaye?

57:24.166 --> 57:25.710
I don't know, do I?

57:26.669 --> 57:28.004
You see this knife?

57:28.421 --> 57:29.880
Not very clean, no.

57:31.674 --> 57:32.591
Oh, yes.

57:32.717 --> 57:34.802
We saw you with the man
who took our money.

57:34.885 --> 57:36.971
Yes, but he went off
without me, didn't he?

57:37.013 --> 57:38.431
Anyway, he hasn't got it.

57:38.764 --> 57:40.224
He works for Mr Casey.

57:40.558 --> 57:41.267
Mr who?

57:41.267 --> 57:42.309
No, Mr Casey.

57:42.518 --> 57:45.354
Casey's health club.
It's in the phone book.

57:45.563 --> 57:46.397
You'll have it.

57:55.364 --> 57:57.867
You should get yourself a white cane.

58:01.287 --> 58:03.080
I can see very well, thank you.

58:07.251 --> 58:10.045
Look, I'm trying to find a number
of Faith Thomas,

58:10.045 --> 58:11.714
in King's Cross. It's urgent.

58:14.008 --> 58:16.719
The X-rays show there's nothing wrong.

58:17.136 --> 58:20.181
Your arm has a flesh wound.
You are very lucky.

58:21.015 --> 58:22.141
I suppose so.

58:22.141 --> 58:23.142
Because you've banged your head

58:23.350 --> 58:25.811
I have to keep you here
overnight for observation.

58:25.811 --> 58:26.854
Sorry, it's the rules.

58:38.532 --> 58:39.575
Hello, dad?

58:40.493 --> 58:41.869
Your spare glasses,

58:43.954 --> 58:45.414
your night dress.

58:47.291 --> 58:48.000
Hello again.

58:48.209 --> 58:50.211
We'd like something shave, please.

58:52.087 --> 58:53.130
What's this?

58:53.339 --> 58:56.258
It's Epilady. It's very,
very good, actually.

58:56.884 --> 58:59.386
No, we want men's razors.

59:01.055 --> 59:03.557
Just between you and me
- we are very hairy.

59:03.891 --> 59:05.017
Got any dental floss?

59:09.313 --> 59:10.856
One pound nineteen, please.

59:12.107 --> 59:13.067
Thank you.

59:16.278 --> 59:18.781
Only one ticket left
for Rio for tomorrow?

59:20.241 --> 59:21.700
What about the day after?

59:21.700 --> 59:22.743
Is there a waiting list?

59:23.285 --> 59:25.871
No, no. I'll pay for both of us now.

59:25.871 --> 59:27.665
Yes, American Express.

59:28.082 --> 59:29.750
My name is Charles MacManus,
MacManus.

59:31.835 --> 59:33.170
Er... the expiry date is...

59:34.338 --> 59:37.466
Do come in. What exactly
are you looking for?

59:37.675 --> 59:39.134
A missing person.

59:39.343 --> 59:42.137
A dear friend of mine
completely disappeared today.

59:42.471 --> 59:45.474
Name of Charlie. He was last
seen in this street.

59:45.683 --> 59:46.517
An adult?

59:46.725 --> 59:47.768
Not mentally.

59:49.019 --> 59:50.688
I'm here to take care of him.

59:50.729 --> 59:54.566
And his friend was with him,
name of Brian Hope.

59:54.900 --> 59:57.695
They didn't come here.
I'm so sorry to hurry you.

59:57.695 --> 59:59.780
Here's me card.
If they do come here,

59:59.989 --> 01:00:00.823
you will let me know?

01:00:01.156 --> 01:00:02.199
Certainly.

01:00:02.408 --> 01:00:04.910
I'll leave you these photos of them.

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:05.953
Good bye.

01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:14.712
Sister Euphemia. Sister Inviolata.
Are you joining us?

01:00:15.337 --> 01:00:17.006
Can I see those?

01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:18.048
Joining you?

01:00:18.132 --> 01:00:20.426
Yes. We're going to the church
to celebrate Mass.

01:00:20.426 --> 01:00:23.053
Tomorrow's our saint's day.
We will be on retreat.

01:00:23.262 --> 01:00:24.596
Oh, that's funny, so will we.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:27.433
Church time.

01:00:29.101 --> 01:00:33.063
- Have you found that key yet?
- What key?

01:00:58.088 --> 01:00:58.797
Charlie!

01:01:00.174 --> 01:01:02.342
Sorry. Force of habit.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.443
- Let's kill him now.
- No, not yet.

01:01:19.985 --> 01:01:23.614
Let's use him. He's looking
for the money too.

01:01:26.033 --> 01:01:29.244
Sister Euphemia, there's
some woman on the phone.

01:01:29.495 --> 01:01:32.915
Says she can't get you
the other seat to Brazil today.

01:01:32.915 --> 01:01:36.168
But she's reserved two for tomorrow.

01:01:36.251 --> 01:01:37.211
I'll take it.

01:01:37.836 --> 01:01:39.171
Tickets to Brazil?

01:01:39.505 --> 01:01:41.381
Yes. You know,
where the nuts come from.

01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:43.050
I do know where Brazil is.

01:01:43.258 --> 01:01:44.802
Yes. We're going to be missionaries.

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:45.844
You?

01:01:46.178 --> 01:01:48.555
- We got the call.
- What call?

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.598
This call.

01:01:52.434 --> 01:01:53.977
Sister Liz, can I talk to you?

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:55.020
Mr Norris?

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:56.063
<i>(sister Mary: Oh, my God)</i>

01:01:56.063 --> 01:01:58.482
- I tried to telephone you.
- Well, we were in church.

01:01:58.482 --> 01:02:01.693
<i>(NORRIS: It's about a theft of
a large sum of money.)</i>

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:05.781
Possibly stolen by a person
or persons within this convent.

01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:08.575
You'd better come to my office.

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:10.869
Who's that guy with her?

01:02:11.078 --> 01:02:11.912
He looks like a law.

01:02:16.625 --> 01:02:18.085
I've ordered the accounts

01:02:18.293 --> 01:02:22.881
and a great deal of money is missing from
the Catholic Drug Rehabilitation Clinic.

01:02:22.881 --> 01:02:24.967
50,000 quid, right?

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:26.009
You know?

01:02:30.305 --> 01:02:32.266
That man is the auditor.

01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:35.602
Oh, is that all?

01:02:38.313 --> 01:02:39.565
I've done a terrible thing.

01:02:40.816 --> 01:02:43.318
I've lost 50,000 pounds on the horses.

01:02:45.112 --> 01:02:47.281
Still, some you win and some you lose.

01:02:47.489 --> 01:02:50.534
Who knows, next week you
might win it all back again.

01:02:51.243 --> 01:02:52.202
Sister Mary?

01:02:52.202 --> 01:02:55.956
She's the Clinic's administrator.
She drinks rather heavily, I'm afraid.

01:02:56.039 --> 01:02:58.125
Apparently she's gambled it
all away on the horses.

01:02:58.333 --> 01:02:59.167
That's criminal.

01:02:59.501 --> 01:03:03.338
What's more to the point,
that money was next year's budget

01:03:03.463 --> 01:03:04.923
for the Drug Rehabilitation Clinic.

01:03:05.132 --> 01:03:07.509
So you're going to report sister
Mary to the police?

01:03:07.509 --> 01:03:09.094
I can't. She's repented.

01:03:09.303 --> 01:03:11.471
And anyway I'm partly responsible.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.017
I gave her more freedom
than she can handle. I'm troubled.

01:03:15.267 --> 01:03:17.853
I really need your help, Mr Norris.

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:20.147
What you need is a miracle.

01:03:22.149 --> 01:03:27.029
Operator, are you sure it's
the right number?
It's a matter of life and death!

01:03:29.031 --> 01:03:30.073
Come!

01:03:34.453 --> 01:03:36.830
What are you doing?
Put those trousers away.

01:03:37.164 --> 01:03:38.206
I'm worried.

01:03:38.206 --> 01:03:39.541
I'm going to find Faith.

01:03:43.628 --> 01:03:46.757
- King's Cross, please.
- My pleasure, sisters.

01:03:58.226 --> 01:03:59.061
Wait here.

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:12.199
Hello. Faith?

01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:22.459
"Don't come back here.

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:24.294
Case may send up Morris
and Abbot to get you.

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:25.337
Love, Brian."

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.673
"Don't come back here"
- that's a bit like saying:
"Do not read this note".

01:04:28.882 --> 01:04:29.925
Well, you write it then.

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:34.387
There's no need. She's got
the sense not to come back here
and risk meeting Abbot and Morley.

01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:39.309
- Oh shit! It's Abbot and Morley!
- Oh shit!

01:04:40.769 --> 01:04:41.686
Where can we hide?

01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:23.103
Jump!

01:05:34.906 --> 01:05:35.740
Quick! Get down there!

01:05:39.578 --> 01:05:40.620
Back to the convent!

01:05:41.454 --> 01:05:43.331
We've got nothing to wear.
What about our habits?

01:05:43.456 --> 01:05:46.668
What about the money?
What about staying alive!

01:05:57.095 --> 01:05:58.138
Charlie...

01:06:37.761 --> 01:06:38.595
Come on, Charlie.

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:39.971
Here, come.

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:44.434
Are you OK?

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:45.477
Yes...

01:07:35.235 --> 01:07:36.778
Brian...

01:08:11.312 --> 01:08:13.273
Rape! Rape! Men! Burglars!

01:08:32.584 --> 01:08:33.209
That way, that way.

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:34.544
Rape! Rape!

01:08:34.752 --> 01:08:35.587
Men!

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:51.435
No one there...

01:08:57.191 --> 01:08:59.777
Are you sure you saw two men?

01:08:59.986 --> 01:09:01.029
Do you think I imagined it?

01:09:12.497 --> 01:09:13.666
Scotch?

01:09:13.666 --> 01:09:14.709
Yes. But...

01:09:16.044 --> 01:09:17.295
Good night everyone.

01:09:19.714 --> 01:09:24.426
Sister Mary, we have to try
and get this problem under control.

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:25.470
Now, go to bed.

01:09:38.066 --> 01:09:39.859
You know? I've been thinking.

01:09:40.068 --> 01:09:41.944
We escaped from Abbot and Morley,

01:09:42.153 --> 01:09:44.447
and the Triads, and Case.

01:09:44.654 --> 01:09:46.407
And where we find sanctuary?

01:09:46.741 --> 01:09:48.701
Here, in the house of God.

01:09:49.327 --> 01:09:50.995
- Sanctuary? Are you kidding me?
- No.

01:09:53.413 --> 01:09:55.166
Maybe God is telling us something.

01:09:55.375 --> 01:09:59.045
We also escaped with the million
pounds of somebody else's money.

01:09:59.045 --> 01:10:00.588
What else is He telling us?

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:04.258
I think God can get us out of this alive.

01:10:04.342 --> 01:10:06.552
I hope you won't be relying on Him totally,

01:10:06.552 --> 01:10:09.138
because we've still got to break
into that bleedin' cupboard!

01:10:09.347 --> 01:10:11.849
God helps those
who help themselves, Brian.

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:13.434
Let's hope you are right.

01:10:13.851 --> 01:10:14.769
I think...

01:10:18.106 --> 01:10:20.608
what God wants us to do now,

01:10:20.733 --> 01:10:25.863
is wait until everyone's asleep,
break into that cupboard,
take the money and go.

01:10:36.374 --> 01:10:37.333
It's only me.

01:10:38.459 --> 01:10:40.336
Why are you up at this time of night?

01:10:40.545 --> 01:10:43.256
I've come to get you - it's my party.

01:10:43.464 --> 01:10:44.632
Party, of course.

01:10:50.555 --> 01:10:51.806
It's Euphemia.

01:11:03.484 --> 01:11:04.318
Let's party!

01:11:10.992 --> 01:11:12.243
Got any booze?

01:11:12.577 --> 01:11:13.494
Sure!

01:11:14.245 --> 01:11:18.833
You know what? We're all anti-nun,
but you two are different.

01:11:18.833 --> 01:11:21.002
No, no. We're just the same.

01:11:22.253 --> 01:11:23.212
Come and sit down.

01:11:41.772 --> 01:11:45.109
Hey, wasn't it gruesome, that girl who
was shot in the street today?

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:46.360
Shot? Who?

01:11:46.861 --> 01:11:48.738
Her name's Faith. They brought her in here.

01:11:48.946 --> 01:11:51.991
She wasn't shot. She was just dizzy.

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:56.162
She says she was shot.
Then kidnapped by Chinese gangsters,

01:11:56.162 --> 01:11:58.873
then she escaped. Now she's in hospital.

01:11:58.873 --> 01:12:01.167
- No one believes it.
- Why not?

01:12:01.375 --> 01:12:06.797
She rang the superior and asked
to speak to a man called Brian!

01:12:08.966 --> 01:12:10.760
In a convent? She's obviously mad!

01:12:13.804 --> 01:12:16.098
It's long after the visiting hours.

01:12:16.307 --> 01:12:18.392
But I'm her spiritual adviser.

01:12:18.392 --> 01:12:20.353
And she still has a family with her.

01:12:20.561 --> 01:12:23.272
Her father and her brother.
They won't go.

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:26.400
I just want to know she's all right.

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:31.322
All right. As it's you, sister.

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:40.164
Hello.

01:12:42.667 --> 01:12:44.543
You must be Faith's father.

01:12:44.752 --> 01:12:46.128
That's right, sister.

01:12:48.422 --> 01:12:50.383
Could I... have a word with you?

01:12:53.719 --> 01:12:54.678
How is she?

01:12:54.678 --> 01:12:57.056
- Oh, she's got a bullet wound.
- A bullet wound?

01:12:57.181 --> 01:13:00.810
Apparently she's been
involved with some gangster

01:13:01.352 --> 01:13:02.186
called Brian.

01:13:04.063 --> 01:13:07.191
Oh, o dear... O dear me.

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:11.445
Erm... Did she tell the police
what happened?

01:13:11.445 --> 01:13:15.408
No, she's too scared.
And if I get my hands on this Brian...

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:18.869
Well, violence never solves anything.

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:23.249
You must learn to forgive,
as Christ forgave.

01:13:24.917 --> 01:13:27.420
- May I have a word with Faith alone?
- Sure.

01:13:30.756 --> 01:13:32.425
Do you mind if I tell her who I am?

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:34.635
If you do, I'll kill you.

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:37.555
Fair enough.

01:13:39.723 --> 01:13:41.809
- Hi, sister.
- How are you, my child?

01:13:41.809 --> 01:13:44.228
Not too bad. Are my glasses there?

01:13:44.436 --> 01:13:45.354
Eh... no.

01:13:47.148 --> 01:13:49.650
So, you are not seriously hurt?

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:50.901
Who cares?

01:13:52.653 --> 01:13:54.530
Well... I care.

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:58.200
But the man I'm in love with doesn't.

01:13:58.409 --> 01:13:59.869
I wish I was dead.

01:14:10.713 --> 01:14:14.133
- We've got to take her with us.
- In one word - no way!

01:14:14.258 --> 01:14:15.176
Why not?

01:14:16.969 --> 01:14:20.306
The Triads have followed her up here.
They're watching out for us.

01:14:20.931 --> 01:14:21.974
Oh my God.

01:14:21.974 --> 01:14:24.768
Look, we've only got
two airplane tickets for tomorrow.

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:26.645
I'm not gonna risk
another day in London.

01:14:26.854 --> 01:14:27.897
What must we do?

01:14:28.522 --> 01:14:32.610
Tomorrow we get up early,
we get the money and we go!

01:14:47.207 --> 01:14:48.959
Up early?

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.461
We always are.

01:15:12.232 --> 01:15:14.026
You know I saw two men last night?

01:15:14.234 --> 01:15:16.820
Oh, I'm sure it was just a nightmare.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.239
Yes, but was it real?

01:15:20.991 --> 01:15:22.368
Your face!

01:15:22.368 --> 01:15:24.119
It's all stubby!
You've got a beard!

01:15:24.244 --> 01:15:25.162
You're a man!

01:15:25.996 --> 01:15:28.290
They're two men!

01:15:41.845 --> 01:15:44.264
Shut up or you're dead!

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.347
Get that axe!

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:47.536
Don't you think you'd better explain?

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:52.541
Aah... Eh... Erm, it's money, obviously.

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:57.045
And, eh... we took it from the Triads gang.
They're drug traffickers.

01:16:57.671 --> 01:16:59.631
- You're men!
- Oh, yeah.

01:16:59.631 --> 01:17:02.134
And we desperately want
to get out of organized crime.

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:05.262
You stole money because
you wanted to get out of crime?

01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:07.764
Oh, it was stolen already
before we stole it.

01:17:07.973 --> 01:17:09.766
A likely story!

01:17:09.766 --> 01:17:14.021
Don't you see? It's just that
the good guys that have the money
instead of the bad guys.

01:17:14.271 --> 01:17:17.816
It's like Robin Hood, you see? We stole
from the rich to give to the poor.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.985
Who are you going to give this money to?

01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:21.028
Us, we are poor.

01:17:21.153 --> 01:17:22.070
Hands up!

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:26.658
Mary? Put that gun down.

01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:30.412
It's okay. It's mine.
It's not loaded.

01:17:32.706 --> 01:17:34.374
It's yours? Phone the police.
The police!

01:17:34.708 --> 01:17:35.417
You bet!

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:36.460
Wait!

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:39.379
I'm a Catholic. I want absolution.

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:41.673
Absolution is only possible
through repentance.

01:17:41.673 --> 01:17:43.759
- I repent.
- So do I.

01:17:43.967 --> 01:17:45.344
- Shutcho!
- Shutcho!

01:17:45.344 --> 01:17:46.386
Yes! Shut up, Mary.

01:17:46.386 --> 01:17:49.097
If you repent, hand that
stolen money over to me.

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:51.266
- Why should you get it?
- Shut up, Brian.

01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:55.354
You see, sister, if you
hand us over to the police,
it means certain death for us.

01:17:55.354 --> 01:17:58.982
We worked for a gang boss who has
associates in every jail in the country.

01:17:58.982 --> 01:18:02.861
We wouldn't last more than 24 hours
before we had a fatal accident!

01:18:02.861 --> 01:18:05.072
Also, I'm in love.
I... I'd like to get married.

01:18:05.072 --> 01:18:08.825
And... they would send us to jail forever
and what end to my girl?

01:18:09.034 --> 01:18:12.371
Besides, I really do repent. Really.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.124
Well, I don't know whether I can believe all this.

01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:18.418
Well, that's your problem, sister.

01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:21.129
From now on - it's every nun for himself!

01:18:25.509 --> 01:18:27.177
Go! Phone!

01:18:38.939 --> 01:18:39.982
I've found them!

01:19:21.398 --> 01:19:22.441
Yes?

01:19:24.317 --> 01:19:25.360
Where?

01:19:40.584 --> 01:19:43.712
We're trying to follow them.
Charlie is quite a driver.

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:53.513
- You're going a wrong way.
- To the airport.

01:19:53.513 --> 01:19:56.641
- To the hospital.
- We are going to the airport!

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:20.832
Get out of the bloody way!

01:20:31.134 --> 01:20:33.345
Hurry up! I'm not sure
if I've given them the slip.

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:35.222
Keep a look at that, OK?

01:20:37.515 --> 01:20:38.225
Faith...

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:39.476
Hello, sister.

01:20:40.018 --> 01:20:41.353
Here are your glasses.

01:20:41.394 --> 01:20:42.729
Ah, thank you.

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:55.992
Brian. Why are you dressed like that?

01:20:56.076 --> 01:20:57.035
I'll explain everything.

01:21:00.038 --> 01:21:03.583
Excuse me, sir. Have you ever
seen a sluice room?

01:21:08.088 --> 01:21:11.925
- This is what we call a bedpan.
- Pepan?

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:14.552
We use it for getting rid of shit!

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:18.932
- Ow!
- Ow!

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.600
Why did you do that?

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.060
You bloody liar!

01:21:22.268 --> 01:21:24.854
- I'm not lying. I love you.
- I don't care, you're married.

01:21:24.854 --> 01:21:27.065
- I'm not married.
- You're not married?

01:21:27.065 --> 01:21:28.108
No.

01:21:28.942 --> 01:21:30.068
Why did you do that?

01:21:30.068 --> 01:21:31.027
I thought you were.

01:21:31.111 --> 01:21:34.656
You told me you didn't love me but you do!

01:21:48.753 --> 01:21:50.422
Do you know what I've been through?

01:21:50.422 --> 01:21:53.842
I risk my life coming here today.
I could be at the airport now.

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:56.344
Risk your life?!
I was shot because of you!

01:21:56.469 --> 01:21:57.387
Shit!

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:10.984
I even went to confess to a priest.

01:22:10.984 --> 01:22:13.987
I told him my problem,
I told him I loved you

01:22:14.112 --> 01:22:15.572
and he told me to keep my trap shut.

01:22:15.572 --> 01:22:17.657
I know. That was me.

01:22:17.741 --> 01:22:19.743
- In the confessional?
- Yes.

01:22:19.826 --> 01:22:22.871
You know the nun
you spoke to last night?

01:22:22.954 --> 01:22:24.414
That was me too.

01:22:25.582 --> 01:22:29.961
- I told you my innermost secret feelings.
- I know.

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:08.416
Which ward is Faith Thomas in?

01:23:08.541 --> 01:23:11.878
Reasonably, she's being visited
by a couple of so called "nuns".

01:23:11.878 --> 01:23:14.255
<i>Ow! Stop slapping me!</i>

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:16.466
Come on! Case is here!

01:23:16.549 --> 01:23:17.509
I've got to sort this out.

01:23:17.509 --> 01:23:21.262
Not now, Brian. We've got to leave.
Check-in is in thirty minutes!

01:23:21.471 --> 01:23:22.305
Charlie!

01:23:23.139 --> 01:23:24.599
- Come on!
- No!

01:23:26.476 --> 01:23:28.853
Faith, I can't leave you.

01:23:29.187 --> 01:23:31.481
I'm gonna stay here and
take what's coming to me.

01:23:31.481 --> 01:23:33.775
- You mean jail?
- I suppose so.

01:23:33.983 --> 01:23:35.860
Will you wait for me?

01:23:37.529 --> 01:23:38.279
No.

01:23:39.113 --> 01:23:40.156
I'm coming with you!

01:23:40.573 --> 01:23:41.699
Get that stretcher!

01:23:43.076 --> 01:23:43.993
Hide the bags!

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:49.624
Tell them we went that way.

01:24:15.692 --> 01:24:17.902
Case...

01:24:31.124 --> 01:24:33.001
Gotcha, f...s!

01:24:50.518 --> 01:24:53.438
Stop... or I'll shoot!

01:24:54.897 --> 01:24:55.732
I thought so.

01:24:57.525 --> 01:24:58.651
Goodbye, boys.

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:12.957
It's your gun, sir?

01:25:19.839 --> 01:25:23.259
Doesn't that bag look
familiar to you, sister Mary?

01:25:29.432 --> 01:25:31.726
- There's only one bag!
- We've lost one!

01:25:32.769 --> 01:25:35.772
- Forget. We've got plenty.
- We only did it for the money.

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:37.440
No, we didn't.

01:25:41.819 --> 01:25:42.570
Sisters,

01:25:44.113 --> 01:25:46.115
there are some policemen out
there looking for you.

01:25:46.324 --> 01:25:47.867
Oh... good.

01:25:49.243 --> 01:25:50.995
Tell them we'll be right back.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:56.542
Any suggestions?

01:26:06.886 --> 01:26:10.431
Wait! Are my seams straight?

01:26:19.482 --> 01:26:20.233
Faith!

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:22.193
Where are they taking you?

01:26:28.574 --> 01:26:29.492
Here's Faith!

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:31.494
- God, look, it's him!
- Who?

01:26:31.577 --> 01:26:32.537
That's Brian.

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.914
- It's Brian, isn't it?
- Yes. Brian.

01:26:35.039 --> 01:26:35.957
That's Brian?

01:26:50.555 --> 01:26:51.305
Freeze!

01:26:51.389 --> 01:26:52.640
Sergeant, we were...

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.850
Shut up! And take those
dresses off!

01:26:55.059 --> 01:26:55.893
Again?

01:26:55.893 --> 01:26:56.936
You're kidding!

01:26:57.144 --> 01:26:58.688
Undress! Of course they're
armed and dangerous.

01:26:58.688 --> 01:26:59.730
You're sure of that, sergeant?

01:26:59.939 --> 01:27:01.524
We're not allowed to strip search women.

01:27:01.732 --> 01:27:03.609
They're not women.

01:27:08.614 --> 01:27:10.700
I said - take 'em off!

01:27:14.745 --> 01:27:15.705
Oh, shit...

01:27:23.212 --> 01:27:25.214
<i>I will kill you! I want my money!</i>

01:27:28.134 --> 01:27:29.885
No! We're blocked in!

01:27:32.388 --> 01:27:34.473
They've seen the bag!

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:38.644
Look, the best getaway car in town.
No one will stop us in that.

01:27:46.902 --> 01:27:48.029
- Thank God.
- Yes

01:27:49.822 --> 01:27:53.159
Why do You have to make
everything so bloody difficult?

01:27:58.998 --> 01:28:03.669
It's enough money for ten
drug rehabilitation clinics.

01:28:04.211 --> 01:28:05.254
But where...?

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:06.797
It's a miracle, Mr Norris.

01:28:07.339 --> 01:28:08.883
Our prayers were answered.

01:28:09.091 --> 01:28:10.259
But it's not yours!

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:11.594
It is now.

01:28:11.594 --> 01:28:12.428
What has happened is

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:14.930
that the good guys have got it
instead of the bad guys.

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:15.973
Like Robin Hood.

01:28:16.182 --> 01:28:18.059
We will put the money to God's use.

01:28:18.392 --> 01:28:21.520
They took it from kids on drugs,
we will use it to get them off drugs.

01:28:21.812 --> 01:28:22.563
But don't you feel guilty?

01:28:24.315 --> 01:28:25.775
Let us pray.

01:28:26.525 --> 01:28:26.942
Oh, God,

01:28:26.942 --> 01:28:30.613
thou hast always moved in mysterious
ways thy wonders to perform,

01:28:30.696 --> 01:28:33.741
but this latest wonder takes
some beating even from You.

01:28:33.949 --> 01:28:36.035
So what we want to say
is thanks a million

01:28:36.118 --> 01:28:37.495
for sending us Euphemia and Inviolata.

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:42.917
And keep an eye on them, won't you?
They need you. Amen.

01:28:47.505 --> 01:28:48.631
Next, please.

01:28:50.299 --> 01:28:53.344
We booked two seats, but we need three.

01:28:53.552 --> 01:28:55.095
What flight and what name?

01:28:55.304 --> 01:28:56.347
The name is...

01:28:57.598 --> 01:29:01.352
Security alert. If anyone asks for tickets
in the name of McManus or Hope,

01:29:01.352 --> 01:29:02.394
we wanna talk to them.

01:29:18.035 --> 01:29:20.120
Would you care for a drink, Madam?

01:29:20.329 --> 01:29:21.372
Some champagne, perhaps?

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:23.374
Or some caviar?

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:27.545
