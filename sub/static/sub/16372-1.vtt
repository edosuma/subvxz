WEBVTT

00:28.160 --> 00:29.196
Critical hit.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.278
He couldn't have gone far.

00:31.480 --> 00:32.834
He wouldn't go to a hospital.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.709
The bleeder works for Kirk.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.752
He'll know where to find them.

00:50.760 --> 00:51.830
I have a location.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.590
I was trying to help.
He has to know that.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.792
I'm not on your side here, Kate.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.914
I need to speak with the patient.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.473
He's gone.

01:56.040 --> 01:59.238
As you well know,
one of the keys to my success...

01:59.440 --> 02:02.114
...is a clear and consistent
understanding...

02:02.280 --> 02:04.033
...of my own limitations.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.357
So often people
overestimate themselves...

02:08.600 --> 02:10.910
...misapply their gifts.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.994
The cleaner suddenly
fancies herself the strategist.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.352
Wisdom is learning the boundaries...

02:18.520 --> 02:21.479
...of one's designated lane.

02:21.840 --> 02:26.517
For instance,
this I will do poorly, clumsily...

02:27.280 --> 02:29.351
...with more mess than necessary.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.239
It'll take longer...

02:33.400 --> 02:36.552
...and be considerably
more unpleasant to boot.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.719
But I can't very well
have you do it, can I?

02:52.800 --> 02:55.872
<i>Raymond Reddington,
my favorite rubio.</i>

02:56.040 --> 02:58.680
God, I haven't seen you
since you snuck off at Carnaval.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.594
Red, Jesus.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.110
What's wrong with you?

03:06.280 --> 03:07.873
We're looking for a name.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.319
Take a close look, Manny.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.632
He worked for a man who abducted
someone I care about.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.552
- He's a cop.
- Who's his rabbi?

03:17.800 --> 03:20.440
I don't know, but I know who might.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.797
- Is it true? She's alive?
- Apparently.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.553
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.712
How...
There were complications during labor.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.520
- The doctor, he declared her dead.
- He lied.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.672
But there was a funeral.
I was a pallbearer.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.672
Who knows what was in that casket?

03:44.840 --> 03:48.675
- It was a charade, Aram.
- So Agent Keen is alive?

03:51.400 --> 03:53.756
But her funeral and her death...

03:53.960 --> 03:56.919
- She faked her death. Why?
- To get away from Reddington.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.510
So her and Tom and Agnes
could have a normal life.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.160
- Away from us?
- Yes...

04:01.360 --> 04:04.080
- ...after everything we did for her.
- Best we could tell...

04:04.240 --> 04:06.880
...Liz and Tom's plan
was to go into hiding in Cuba.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.594
- Alexander Kirk found them.
- Why?

04:08.800 --> 04:10.439
What does he want with Agent Keen?

04:10.680 --> 04:13.195
When Reddington got there,
Liz and Tom were gone.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.397
I just spoke
with the embassy in Havana.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.069
Briefed them on Kirk,
gave them the plane tail number.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.074
If that's how he planned to get off,
that's not gonna happen.

04:21.279 --> 04:25.672
- And what about Agnes?
- At this point, we don't know.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.280
Notify FBI headquarters.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.675
Elizabeth Keen is alive.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.110
The plane is ready.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.596
- Masha and the baby?
- Not yet.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.956
Notify me as soon as they're here.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.159
- My baby.
- She's on her way.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.595
That's what you said before.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.393
- Masha...
- My name is Elizabeth.

04:46.560 --> 04:50.236
I understand that you have questions,
that you're upset.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.240
Sorry it has to be like this.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.434
- You're not my father.
- Well, I am, Masha. I am.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.193
And I intend to prove that to you.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.711
Agnes will be brought here. The person
doing that has a job to do first.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.839
What job? With Tom?

05:14.440 --> 05:16.432
What are you doing to Tom?

05:25.280 --> 05:27.112
Let me out!

05:51.280 --> 05:52.270
Grandpa, look.

05:52.840 --> 05:53.830
What's up, babe?

05:58.680 --> 05:59.670
Police.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.835
There's nothing more depressing
than a failed Communist state.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.555
It doesn't even really pay
to be corrupt.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.480
When dirty cops
play poker in America...

06:19.640 --> 06:21.552
...they're able to play for real money.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.078
Let's raise the stakes.

06:24.320 --> 06:27.233
- What's up, Manny? Who is this guy?
- He's a friend.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.631
He's just looking for a name.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.710
A new game.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.277
You tell me who the head worked for...

06:41.440 --> 06:43.955
...you keep the money, a five-way split.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.840
Oh, we're keeping the money.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.712
A young woman and her child
were taken.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.872
A Russian has entered the country.
I have it on good authority...

06:55.040 --> 06:57.316
...your friend here was assisting him.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.392
I think it's time for you to leave.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.354
Make that a four-way split.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.756
Guys, just tell him what he wants.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.110
I'll give you a name.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.875
Well, isn't this your lucky day?

07:19.400 --> 07:21.790
The head worked for
a Jhosep Balzan?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.116
I've never heard of him.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.516
He's a supplier
of all manner of contraband...

07:25.680 --> 07:26.716
...on the island.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.191
If the people you're looking
for are in Cuba...

07:29.360 --> 07:30.794
...Balzan is protecting them.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.354
Should I assemble a team?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.832
Dembe, call Silvio in San CristÃ³bal.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.232
Tell him to put a team together.
We're going after Elizabeth.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.160
Here.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.236
You think I'd drug you?

07:54.920 --> 07:56.752
You kidnapped my infant daughter...

07:56.960 --> 07:58.633
...my husband and me.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.871
I'd say you're capable of anything.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.395
Listen...

08:02.560 --> 08:05.439
...you were my entire life.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.555
You were all your mother and I
ever cared about.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.837
Now, you don't know any of that...

08:11.000 --> 08:13.071
...because Reddington
took you away from us...

08:13.240 --> 08:15.152
...when you were just a little girl.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.918
He and your mother had an affair.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.800
For a time, I thought
maybe he was the father...

08:21.960 --> 08:24.316
...but I have proof that he's not.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.596
He's just a spiteful, evil man.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.159
Couldn't accept it when Katarina
broke off the affair.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.590
One day I came home,
and you were gone.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.034
He'd taken you.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.154
I never thought
I'd ever see you again...

08:40.480 --> 08:43.313
...until there you were in the news...

08:43.480 --> 08:46.439
...you and Reddington...

08:46.640 --> 08:48.552
...the most wanted fugitives
in the world.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.792
If you cared so much about me,
you wouldn't hold me hostage.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.310
He'd taken my child
and turned her into a criminal.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.119
Attack my wedding, everyone I love.

08:56.280 --> 08:59.034
Everything I did was to get my child
away from Reddington.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.839
Who understands that more than you?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.520
You did the exact same thing...

09:02.680 --> 09:05.991
...faked your own death
to get your child away from him.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.074
We have a problem.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.959
The PNR have surrounded the plane.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.316
Then find another plane.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.960
Agnes will be here shortly.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.710
And Tom?

09:37.080 --> 09:38.196
What do we do?

09:38.760 --> 09:40.592
The hell are you doing, bobo?

09:41.760 --> 09:43.160
They have my baby! Please!

09:43.840 --> 09:47.311
Keen, you breathe a word,
I'm gonna fire two bullets:

09:47.520 --> 09:48.556
One in the cop...

09:48.760 --> 09:51.195
...the other between the eyes
of that screaming kid.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.669
You got it?

09:52.840 --> 09:53.830
Out of the car.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.469
Open the trunk.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.350
You, out of the car.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.359
Move it.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.835
Sir, my baby. Please, she's upset.
Let me take my baby with...

10:17.000 --> 10:18.150
Shut up.

10:25.960 --> 10:26.950
Open it.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.400
He's got a gun!

10:42.760 --> 10:44.797
No, don't, please!

11:01.120 --> 11:02.474
Where are we on Kirk?

11:02.720 --> 11:05.360
PNR grounded his plane.
There's no sign of him or Keen.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.195
I informed the Bureau
Keen has risen from the dead.

11:08.400 --> 11:12.314
They said three Hail Marys and are
on the lookout for the zombie apocalypse.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.634
I understand. You feel played.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.354
Don't you, sir?

11:16.520 --> 11:18.512
Look, we should
be halfway to Havana by now.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.473
Why? She doesn't want our help.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.878
Maybe or maybe not, but she needs it.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.511
- You'd risk your life after what she did?
- Let's have this conversation.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.996
Keen lied to us,
took advantage of all of us...

11:30.160 --> 11:32.516
...and no one is more upset
about that than I.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.672
Or relieved.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.312
Truth be told,
I didn't think it possible...

11:37.520 --> 11:40.274
...to be this joyous and livid
at the same time.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.760
But I have a job to do:

11:41.960 --> 11:44.839
Find Keen and her family
and bring them home safely.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.556
And I know that no matter
how I feel, I can do that job.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.032
I need to know if each of you
can say the same.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.759
Somebody's here. In the building.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.959
- Contact the FAR.
- Already on their way.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.072
The Russian. Where is he?

13:16.800 --> 13:18.678
Hello, Raymond.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.958
Elizabeth, are you okay?

13:26.200 --> 13:27.520
Of course she is.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.639
Unlike you, I would never hurt
my own daughter.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.833
Elizabeth?

13:35.400 --> 13:36.720
- Elizabeth.
- I'm on your left.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.640
Constantin.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.390
What do you want?

13:53.600 --> 13:54.590
Name it.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.592
Bring her out unharmed,
you'll have it.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.116
The Concierge of Crime
wants to cut a deal.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.952
- You'll give me whatever I want?
- Yes.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.430
In exchange for Masha?

14:05.600 --> 14:07.910
Whatever you desire.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.954
What I desire is to raise my child...

14:11.160 --> 14:12.799
...to watch her grow...

14:12.960 --> 14:15.600
...and to have back the 26 years
of being a father...

14:15.760 --> 14:17.035
...that you took from me.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.072
But you can't give me that, can you?

14:19.600 --> 14:21.273
No.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.955
Because she was never yours to raise.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.553
Patrol unit incoming.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.838
Military patrol. Armored military.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.151
- Agnes. Do you have Agnes?
- I don't have her.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.556
Go. Find Agnes and Tom.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.833
I'm not leaving here without you.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.515
You just don't get it.
She doesn't want to be with you.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.599
That's why she faked her own death,
to get away from you.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.996
- We have to go.
- If they get you, they'll kill you.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.357
- Raymond.
- Did you hear me? You have to go.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.193
Go!

14:54.720 --> 14:57.554
Elizabeth, I will come for you.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.031
Harold, gather your team.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.072
Reddington. Where are you?

15:21.440 --> 15:22.920
Tell me you have Agent Keen.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.631
<i>No, but she's still on the island.</i>

15:25.800 --> 15:27.359
<i>Kirk's preparing their exit plan.</i>

15:27.520 --> 15:29.557
I don't know what
the preparations are...

15:29.720 --> 15:32.838
...but I know who can find out.
Manuel Esteban.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.390
The Chilean spymaster?

15:34.600 --> 15:35.670
Who's Esteban?

15:35.880 --> 15:37.314
Our next Blacklister.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.758
<i>Manuel Orentez Esteban.</i>

15:39.920 --> 15:41.752
<i>Leader of Pinochet's
Caravan of Death...</i>

15:41.960 --> 15:44.520
<i>...that institutionalized
state-sponsored terror...</i>

15:44.720 --> 15:47.280
<i>...through abuse, abduction
and murder.</i>

15:47.680 --> 15:50.240
According to our database,
he died in 1989.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.430
Except he didn't.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.399
Esteban is alive and well
and a legendary enforcer...

15:54.560 --> 15:57.200
...for a series
of authoritarian regimes.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.596
Assuming what you say is true
and he's alive...

15:59.760 --> 16:01.717
...what makes you think
he can locate Keen?

16:01.880 --> 16:04.315
<i>Kirk's man in Cuba
is protected by the military.</i>

16:04.520 --> 16:07.592
<i>If the military is involved,
Esteban will know about it.</i>

16:07.760 --> 16:10.400
We'll never find him in time.
We have no assets in Cuba.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.239
Of course you do, Harold.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.955
Esteban.
He works for your government.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.960
<i>Castro took him in,
and the CIA immediately...</i>

16:18.160 --> 16:20.356
<i>...put him on the payroll
as a double agent.</i>

16:20.520 --> 16:24.196
What little you know about the inner
workings of the Cuban government...

16:24.400 --> 16:26.551
<i>...is courtesy of Manuel Esteban.</i>

16:26.760 --> 16:28.433
The CIA knows where to find him...

16:28.600 --> 16:30.910
...and he knows
where to find Elizabeth.

16:32.080 --> 16:38.520
Ivelisse, dear, don't cry, my love.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.910
You know who I am.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.110
Yes.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.476
And you know what it means
to see my face.

17:00.160 --> 17:04.313
Most people fear the dark.

17:05.280 --> 17:09.718
I don't know anything else.
I see with my ears.

17:10.839 --> 17:14.231
Every environment has its
own acoustical signature.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.871
But your father...

17:18.520 --> 17:20.954
...and your brother...

17:21.119 --> 17:25.830
...whether they survive depends on you.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.477
Tell me what you see.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.639
What is the plan
for getting off the island?

17:59.840 --> 18:01.638
What are you talking
to Reddington for?

18:01.800 --> 18:04.793
I thought your task force was disbanded
after Agent Keen's death.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.111
Turns out she's not dead.
She's been kidnapped.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.920
If we have any hope for finding her,
it rests on Esteban.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.072
I need to know where to find him.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.471
I hate getting into bed
with Reddington.

18:14.680 --> 18:19.311
I hate needing him and his list.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.591
If you find Agent Keen...

18:22.800 --> 18:25.634
- ...will he continue to give you names?
- He just did. Esteban.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.833
According to him,
Esteban works for the agency.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.314
Good Lord.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.676
Is there anything that man
doesn't know?

18:35.080 --> 18:36.150
<i>How can we contact him?</i>

18:36.320 --> 18:37.834
<i>The agency reaches out to him...</i>

18:38.000 --> 18:40.276
<i>...through the State's
weekly travel advisory.</i>

18:40.480 --> 18:43.234
<i>Set a meeting, a message
is encoded in the advisory...</i>

18:43.400 --> 18:45.198
<i>...detailing where and when.</i>

18:45.360 --> 18:47.317
The meeting is set
for the National Museum.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.477
You'll be going undercover, as tourists.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.000
He'll be going, not me.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.878
You may be fine with doing this job,
no matter how you feel.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.394
- I can't.
- How you feel?

18:56.560 --> 18:57.994
How about how Keen feels?

18:58.240 --> 19:00.596
Forget about what she did
and try to figure out why.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.956
I have. And someday,
maybe I'll be okay with it.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.230
But right now I'm not.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.436
- What, you're okay with this?
- No.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.399
But for now, I accept it.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.555
You'll be going alone.
Here's how it's gonna work.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.554
<i>Your agent will be detailed...</i>

19:16.720 --> 19:19.394
<i>...with the Dallas/Fort Worth
Arts and Cultural Committee.</i>

19:19.560 --> 19:22.155
<i>Esteban will expect to meet
at the CafÃ© Aventura...</i>

19:22.320 --> 19:23.959
<i>...across from
the National Museum.</i>

19:24.160 --> 19:27.517
Once inside, take a table
in the back, order an egg coffee.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.399
I appreciate you burning a source.

19:29.640 --> 19:32.872
You knowing he exists
is the least of Esteban's problems.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.756
<i>Now that we're all chummy
with the Cubanos...</i>

19:35.920 --> 19:40.790
<i>...his relationship with the agency
is something of a liability.</i>

19:41.000 --> 19:42.195
You're gonna scrub him?

19:42.400 --> 19:45.552
Let's just say, if you wanna
reach out to Esteban...

19:45.720 --> 19:47.439
...you should do it quickly.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.714
Jesus.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.276
Hot as balls in here.
You actually drink this stuff?

20:19.920 --> 20:22.037
Chico don't look like much.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.799
Kill him first.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.952
Come back for the cop.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.117
Meet you at that place.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.230
Hey!

21:00.520 --> 21:02.671
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

21:05.320 --> 21:06.913
Romina.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.480
- Move it.
- Hey.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.639
Hey.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.480
Let her go.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.710
Look, you can take me.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.799
Do whatever you want.
Just give me my little girl! Hey!

21:19.040 --> 21:22.033
I'm begging you!
Give me my little girl!

21:22.320 --> 21:23.549
Please!

21:29.280 --> 21:31.590
You and I are gonna
have some fun, man.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.114
Hey.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.919
Don't talk. They'll kill us.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.515
Where are we?

21:59.680 --> 22:01.558
How many people
does he have down here?

22:01.720 --> 22:02.710
My family...

22:03.520 --> 22:05.159
...they have a way out.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.079
He wants me to tell him how.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.639
He's going to kill me.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.113
I've seen his face. Anyone who s...

22:14.960 --> 22:16.519
It's him.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.797
Upright. Upright.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.909
So the rumors are true.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.600
They sent you to finish me.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.790
Not quite, no.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.639
The Americans want me dead...

22:38.840 --> 22:41.309
...so our relationship dies with me...

22:41.480 --> 22:43.153
...so I can't embarrass them.

22:43.360 --> 22:44.555
I'm not here to kill you.

22:44.720 --> 22:48.077
I'm here to tell you that
Raymond Reddington wants to see you.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.517
Oh, so now the U.S. government
is Reddington's messenger.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.194
Oh, you know how it works.

22:53.360 --> 22:56.398
The American government has deals
with all kinds of scumbags.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.511
Look, I'll tell you how it works.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.876
You're gonna give me your phone.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.631
I'm gonna dial a number.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.757
Okay, cowboy.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.798
I like this one.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.440
Reddington?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.597
Manuel Esteban.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.315
My heavens, you're a devil
to get ahold of.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.790
I'm surprised we've never met.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.758
I'd like to have a little chitchat.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.958
How would you feel
about a blind date?

23:46.080 --> 23:47.753
I'm looking for a woman.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.434
Aren't we all?

23:49.600 --> 23:51.398
Her name is Elizabeth Keen...

23:51.560 --> 23:55.236
...and the man holding her
has the protection of the FAR.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.798
They know where she is,
which means you know where she is...

23:58.960 --> 24:02.271
...or you could certainly find out.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.915
Why would I help you?

24:04.120 --> 24:07.796
- You're an anarchist.
- Probably.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.634
Maybe more of an opportunist.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.230
And I have the opportunity
to help you.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.472
You spent a lifetime bouncing...

24:15.680 --> 24:18.912
...from one authoritarian regime
to the next.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.594
But this is the last stop.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.952
You're a relic.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.431
The dÃ©tente
between America and Cuba...

24:25.600 --> 24:27.273
...makes you a man without a country.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.711
Sooner or later,
both sides will want you dead.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.349
My money's on sooner.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.680
I can take care of myself.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.032
Clicking like a hairless fruit bat
is impressive, Manuel...

24:42.200 --> 24:45.637
...but you and I both know
avoiding a lamppost...

24:45.800 --> 24:49.396
...is very different from
avoiding an assassin's bullet.

24:49.560 --> 24:53.315
Echolocation can't help you
with that, but I can.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.273
What do you propose?

24:56.480 --> 24:58.233
I know what it's like to be hunted.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.791
I've protected myself for 30 years.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.429
And I can protect you...

25:04.720 --> 25:07.872
...after you locate Elizabeth Keen.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.673
All right, listen to me, please.

25:19.640 --> 25:20.960
The baby, I can pay you.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.799
- Quiet.
- Not me. I have a friend.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.680
He'll help you.
We'll get you off the island, protect you.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.912
- I said quiet, man.
- Look, just let her go!

25:28.080 --> 25:29.434
You can kill me, I don't care.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.472
Just let my baby go.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.676
Let's go and dig.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.312
I know you don't want
to talk to me. Fine.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.470
Then listen.

26:07.800 --> 26:12.238
It was excruciating to watch you
mourn Elizabeth's death...

26:12.400 --> 26:16.155
...to know that I was
making you endure that.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.918
Yes, I betrayed you...

26:20.080 --> 26:23.152
...but only after you had betrayed her.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.914
Raymond, you have to change.

26:30.600 --> 26:31.875
I took Elizabeth from you...

26:32.040 --> 26:34.509
...and now I need your help
to get her back.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.235
But when you do, as I'm sure you will...

26:37.720 --> 26:41.316
...you have to let her go.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.080
Why don't you wait in the car?

26:55.120 --> 26:56.839
I have a location for the girl.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.675
And the child?

26:59.880 --> 27:02.679
I asked, my people
know nothing about a child.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.076
Tell me about the location.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.633
It is heavily protected.

27:09.800 --> 27:12.395
Twenty, maybe more.

27:12.600 --> 27:13.954
I'll need more men.

27:15.520 --> 27:17.751
That won't be necessary.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.154
I have a blood disorder.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.720
Good.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.156
I'm dying.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.396
Even better.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.594
They're here.

27:48.640 --> 27:52.793
Oh, baby.
Are you okay, sweetheart?

27:52.960 --> 27:54.519
Let me look at you.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.917
Oh, you're okay.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.992
Oh, my God.

27:59.600 --> 28:03.071
It's okay. You're a strong girl.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.920
Everything's gonna be okay.
You're with Mommy now.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.110
She's beautiful.

28:09.640 --> 28:10.630
Yes?

28:11.080 --> 28:12.560
Yes, it's good to hear from you.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.479
You disappoint me, Balzan.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.880
Yes, yes, of course.

28:17.720 --> 28:18.710
It's the pilot.

28:18.960 --> 28:22.317
Everything is on schedule.
I'll notify the men.

28:24.040 --> 28:27.272
I assume the husband's
been taken care of.

28:37.440 --> 28:38.430
<i>Hello?</i>

28:38.600 --> 28:39.636
Is it done?

28:39.960 --> 28:41.235
I told you.
Chico ain't gonna be a problem.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.190
What's taking so long?

28:44.480 --> 28:47.951
Nothing is. What's wrong with you?
You want to listen? Hang on.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.431
Angel. Angel?

29:04.280 --> 29:05.839
<i>Angel?</i>

29:14.080 --> 29:15.992
He wants to talk to you.

29:17.520 --> 29:18.636
Hello. Who's this?

29:18.800 --> 29:21.269
<i>All that matters is that
you have a little girl...</i>

29:21.480 --> 29:23.836
<i>- ...and you have a mother.
- Tom.</i>

29:24.400 --> 29:25.914
I'm coming for them...

29:26.080 --> 29:27.799
...for you.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.355
And not just me, an army.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.194
<i>You hear me?</i>

29:32.800 --> 29:34.519
An army is coming for you.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.392
You lost Tom.

30:03.560 --> 30:04.550
We'll be going soon.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.030
Where?

30:06.400 --> 30:07.959
Home.

30:10.920 --> 30:13.276
I'm not going anywhere with you.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.431
I faked my death to have a normal life.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.515
There's nothing normal
about being held prisoner.

30:19.720 --> 30:23.509
A temporary inconvenience. You'll see
in time that the normal life you want...

30:23.720 --> 30:26.030
...I'm the only one
who can give that to you.

30:29.680 --> 30:32.593
She's hungry,
which means I need to feed her.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.038
- Which means you need to leave.
- Of course.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.631
I've done what I can,
but you must hurry.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.752
Kirk has chartered a float plane.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.715
- There isn't much time.
- For either of us.

30:49.920 --> 30:52.151
A stevedore will meet you on Pier 36.

30:52.360 --> 30:55.558
I've arranged for a berth
on a container ship bound for Caracas.

30:56.160 --> 30:57.753
AdiÃ³s.

30:58.520 --> 31:01.399
- We have an ETA on that plane?
- Your job here is done, Donald.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.071
Like hell it is. I came here to get Keen.
I'm not leaving without her.

31:05.240 --> 31:08.916
Think I'll let you tag along so you can
inform those who kidnapped Elizabeth...

31:09.080 --> 31:12.756
...they have the right to remain silent?
I appreciate your assistance...

31:12.960 --> 31:16.317
...but I'm not interested
in having an ethical debate with you...

31:16.560 --> 31:19.029
...about whether they have the right
to an attorney...

31:19.240 --> 31:21.550
...before I put a bullet in their head.
Excuse me.

31:21.760 --> 31:22.955
What about that dirtball?

31:23.160 --> 31:25.880
I suppose you think I should be okay
with letting him walk.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.275
It's entirely up to you.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.479
- You made a deal with him.
- Yes, in order to save Elizabeth...

31:30.680 --> 31:32.637
...I made a deal
with the devil of the day.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.400
I did. You didn't.
If you have a problem with that...

31:35.600 --> 31:37.831
...you've got 12 hours
before his ship leaves...

31:38.080 --> 31:42.438
...to do something about it.
Otherwise, safe travels home, Donald.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.880
Elizabeth?

31:51.400 --> 31:53.232
Ready to go?

31:59.280 --> 32:00.999
Balzan!

32:01.760 --> 32:03.114
Balzan!

32:03.800 --> 32:06.952
He's gone. Your guards, your security,
they're all gone.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.753
The child and the girl, find them.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.470
This is Agent Mojtabai.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.195
<i>- Aram, it's Tom.
- Tom? Tell me you're with Agent Keen.</i>

32:16.400 --> 32:19.677
The man who took Agnes, he's driving
a blue Dodge sedan, late '50s.

32:19.840 --> 32:23.834
- He's taking her to Liz. We follow the car...
- We can find them. Okay, let me think.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.514
<i>Okay, what I'm thinking is...</i>

32:26.000 --> 32:28.515
Did you help Agent Keen
fake her death?

32:28.720 --> 32:30.279
- Aram.
- Not helpful, I know.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.314
Did you? At the funeral,
when you put a flower on her casket.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.398
The car, it has an old tube radio.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.836
<i>- Local oscillator.
- The oscillator. Of course.</i>

32:38.040 --> 32:42.034
Okay, if you could rewire it, you might
be able to turn the PLL receiver into...

32:42.240 --> 32:43.879
A low-power mono FM transmitter...

32:44.080 --> 32:46.231
...that produces a signal you can trace.
I know.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.199
You do? Then why are you...?

32:49.120 --> 32:51.396
To get you to trace the signal, Aram.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.750
<i>Oh, you already...</i>

32:53.240 --> 32:55.038
Wow, that's... That is impressive.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.159
Okay. Hang on. I'm on it.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.352
<i>- Thank you.
- Did you know?</i>

32:59.560 --> 33:01.392
At the christening...

33:01.720 --> 33:03.791
...when you made me a godfather
to Agnes.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.191
I know you're upset,
but now is not the time.

33:06.400 --> 33:09.518
I'm trying to ping the signal.
Waiting for a reply...

33:09.960 --> 33:10.996
...from both of you.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.839
Aram...

33:13.800 --> 33:14.916
...of course I knew.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.672
I'll let you know when I find the signal.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.599
Thank you.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.916
Please. Please, Agnes, stop crying.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.640
Mommy's here.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.757
Think about what you're doing.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.713
What are you gonna do? Hurt me?

34:03.920 --> 34:05.877
Hurt my baby?

34:06.240 --> 34:07.594
Kirk will kill you if you do.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.835
Are you a mother?
Do you have children?

34:12.040 --> 34:13.713
Look at her.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.273
Hey!

34:35.360 --> 34:36.793
No!

34:37.000 --> 34:39.594
Little mama, you got spirit.

34:39.840 --> 34:40.989
Get up. Get the baby.

34:55.120 --> 34:58.318
You'll learn to trust me. Get the baby
and the things. We're leaving.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.352
Like hell we are.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.636
- No!
- I wish there was another way, I do...

35:03.800 --> 35:05.439
...but Reddington's on his way.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.438
- Agnes!
- Come on.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.994
Get her on board.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.718
<i>- Yeah.
- Mr. Reddington. It's Aram.</i>

35:14.960 --> 35:16.030
It's not a good time.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.357
I have information on Agent Keen.
A location.

35:18.560 --> 35:22.236
<i>- She's being held near this...
- A small fishing port by Playa Larga.</i>

35:22.440 --> 35:25.000
- We're on our way.
- Magic. How'd you do that?

35:25.200 --> 35:27.590
<i>- We'll have Elizabeth shortly.
- And Agnes.</i>

35:27.800 --> 35:28.836
<i>- Agnes?
- Right.</i>

35:29.040 --> 35:31.874
<i>Tom called. Thanks to him,
I was able to track the vehicle...</i>

35:32.080 --> 35:35.198
<i>...where he had last seen Agnes.
A blue Dodge sedan.</i>

35:35.440 --> 35:37.113
Thank you, Aram.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.431
Agnes is here.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.792
Luis, you and your men take
the perimeters to the north and the west.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.238
Dembe, secure the house.
Silvio, you're with me to the south.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.477
You stay put.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.194
That's not your child.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.118
They're gone.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.800
I'm sorry, Raymond.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.192
We have her.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.555
You told them he worked for us?

38:31.760 --> 38:35.470
Do you have any idea what kind
of blowback I'm dealing with here?

38:35.680 --> 38:38.434
<i>And it doesn't take long to find out
who told the Cubans.</i>

38:38.640 --> 38:40.120
Heard it was an anonymous tip.

38:40.320 --> 38:43.199
- Agent Ressler...
- Are you a traitor or just a moron?

38:43.600 --> 38:46.035
Look, the agency
was gonna assassinate Esteban.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.594
I have no direct knowledge...

38:47.840 --> 38:51.038
So the Cubans wouldn't find out
who was feeding secrets to the CIA.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.391
Whoever this source is,
he saved a lot of lives.

38:53.640 --> 38:54.869
What are you talking about?

38:55.080 --> 38:56.958
America knows about
Esteban's torture chamber.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.640
<i>Cubans will want plausible deniability.</i>

38:58.840 --> 39:01.275
What do you want to do
with the prisoners?

39:01.520 --> 39:03.671
Let them out.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.758
They weren't here.

39:05.960 --> 39:08.429
This never happened.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.556
<i>Let's not mince words. You took it upon
yourself to tell the Cubans about our...</i>

39:12.760 --> 39:15.400
<i>No, I took it upon myself
to stop what Esteban was doing.</i>

39:15.600 --> 39:17.398
Do you have any idea what that was?

39:17.600 --> 39:20.593
No, because all you care about
is what Esteban was doing for you.

39:21.240 --> 39:24.711
There are bigger issues, Agent Ressler.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.917
<i>Torture, abuse, murder.</i>

39:27.440 --> 39:29.830
I don't see any bigger issues than that.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.519
Excuse me.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.393
Have you heard from Reddington?

39:38.640 --> 39:42.873
No. Last time I spoke to him,
he was on his way to the location...

39:43.080 --> 39:47.757
- ...where Agent Keen was being held.
- I'm sure he'll call. I'm sure they're okay.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.037
I think you were wrong
not going to Cuba.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.156
I'm not saying what Agent Keen did
was right...

39:57.360 --> 40:01.036
...but as long as her life is in danger,
as long as Agnes' life is in danger...

40:01.240 --> 40:03.118
...we have to put our feelings aside.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.152
What's happening to Liz
is her own fault.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.399
I know that sounds harsh...

40:07.560 --> 40:10.519
...but it's true. She made decisions
that have consequences.

40:10.760 --> 40:12.831
- She has to live with them.
- She's in trouble.

40:13.040 --> 40:17.273
I know, and I'm angry. If she'd behaved
differently, she wouldn't be in this position.

40:17.480 --> 40:21.315
But she is. And no matter how we feel,
I think we have to do something about it.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.549
I don't.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.558
If you don't help...

40:34.640 --> 40:38.270
...and something happens
to Agent Keen or Agnes...

40:38.880 --> 40:40.633
I know you.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.910
...You won't be able to live with yourself.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.720
Yes? It's Tom.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.389
Tell him we were too late.
Kirk has Elizabeth.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.075
<i>- What about Agnes?
- She's with us. Safe.</i>

41:02.880 --> 41:04.997
Your daughter is safe.

41:25.600 --> 41:29.037
Raymond, I've been thinking
about where we go from here...
