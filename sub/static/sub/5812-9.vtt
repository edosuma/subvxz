Look...

13:05.525 --> 13:08.026
just sit tight,
keep quiet.

13:08.028 --> 13:09.661
The less you know,
the better.

13:09.663 --> 13:12.630
And when I need you,
I'll let you know.

13:12.632 --> 13:15.333
MAN: Hey, hello?
Can somebody call the police?

13:17.304 --> 13:20.605
(laughs)

13:22.042 --> 13:23.375
MAN:
No. No, no!

13:35.389 --> 13:36.988
We are hot
shit, buddy.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.957
I can't believe
you're marrying a girl.

13:38.959 --> 13:41.393
I'm gonna be blunt.

13:41.395 --> 13:43.628
Your father is bisexual.

13:43.630 --> 13:46.164
People think that word
means something dirty,

13:46.166 --> 13:47.699
but it doesn't.

13:47.701 --> 13:51.036
It means I like men and
I like women, equally.

13:51.038 --> 13:54.239
People don't understand,
so they treat me like I'm weird.

13:54.241 --> 13:56.241
Or like I'm trying
to hide something.

13:56.243 --> 13:58.843
Or that...
That you only like guys?

13:58.845 --> 14:01.713
Yeah, something like that.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.815
(chuckles)

14:03.817 --> 14:06.651
And if you're lucky,

14:06.653 --> 14:08.887
once in your life,

14:08.889 --> 14:11.890
you find somebody
who really understands you.

14:13.527 --> 14:16.261
And I didn't think someone
like that existed for me.

14:16.263 --> 14:18.063
Until I met The Countess.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.097
(sighs)

14:19.099 --> 14:21.166
She's the one.

14:22.436 --> 14:24.502
And when you meet the one,

14:24.504 --> 14:28.606
you hold on tight
and you never let go.

14:28.608 --> 14:30.708
Don't marry her.

14:30.710 --> 14:32.410
She's not the one for you.

14:32.412 --> 14:34.679
For any man.
Excuse me, who are you?

14:34.681 --> 14:37.015
How did you get in here?
That's Ms. Evers.

14:37.017 --> 14:38.283
She works here.
Would you like me

14:38.285 --> 14:40.785
to bring you a
knife, Mr. Drake?

14:40.787 --> 14:42.720
Perhaps a pistol?

14:42.722 --> 14:44.422
Or are you the type
who would prefer

14:44.424 --> 14:46.124
to hurl yourself
out a window?

14:46.126 --> 14:48.126
Excuse me?
Well, clearly
you want to

14:48.128 --> 14:49.394
commit suicide.

14:49.396 --> 14:51.196
Why else would you agree

14:51.198 --> 14:53.765
to marry that poisonous
leech of a woman?

14:53.767 --> 14:55.433
You are way out of line.

14:55.435 --> 14:58.803
If you marry The Countess,
you will die.

14:58.805 --> 15:00.105
And your boy,
too, probably.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.773
Get the hell out of here.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.741
You must believe me, sir.
Once she puts the ring

15:03.743 --> 15:05.877
on your finger,
she will bleed you dry.

15:05.879 --> 15:07.278
I have a prenup
to protect me from that.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.880
Get the hell out of here.

15:08.882 --> 15:11.249
You're fired.
I was supposed to be married!

15:11.251 --> 15:12.984
I loved him.

15:12.986 --> 15:16.221
But he chose
to love her instead.

15:16.223 --> 15:19.224
My father always
said to marry

15:19.226 --> 15:20.925
a homely woman.

15:20.927 --> 15:23.728
Less trouble.

15:23.730 --> 15:25.730
I disagree.

15:25.732 --> 15:28.333
I adore you.
I depend on you.

15:28.335 --> 15:29.968
Look at the suit
I'm wearing.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.736
It was covered in bile,
literal bile,

15:31.738 --> 15:33.738
from a pullman
I knifed the other day.

15:33.740 --> 15:35.607
It's like nothing
was ever there.

15:35.609 --> 15:36.774
(laughs)

15:36.776 --> 15:39.310
You're a genius.

15:39.312 --> 15:43.348
But The Countess
is a creature from heaven.

15:43.350 --> 15:44.983
Style,

15:44.985 --> 15:48.286
grace, beauty.

15:48.288 --> 15:52.023
It's not your fault
you were graced with...

15:52.025 --> 15:54.626
different gifts.

15:54.628 --> 15:57.629
No one survives her.

15:57.631 --> 15:59.130
Please leave.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.499
I never want to see you
in this hotel again.

16:01.501 --> 16:03.935
So be it.

16:06.106 --> 16:07.605
One day,

16:07.607 --> 16:10.675
very soon,
you will understand.

16:10.677 --> 16:13.978
You will know nothing
but pain, hmm?

16:13.980 --> 16:15.547
And I will
be there.

16:15.549 --> 16:18.616
And you will reach out to me
for help and mercy,

16:18.618 --> 16:22.453
and in return, I will watch you
die with a smile on my face,

16:22.455 --> 16:25.523
because I will know
that once you are gone,

16:25.525 --> 16:28.326
I will get the chance
to clean the blood and shit

16:28.328 --> 16:31.596
out of that pretty
formal wear of yours.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.334
(door opens, closes)

16:36.336 --> 16:39.837
I just wanted to confirm
everything because it looks like

16:39.839 --> 16:41.573
someone just tried
to open up this wall.

16:41.575 --> 16:44.042
Yes, and I'm telling you now
to close it.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.677
With a security door.

16:45.679 --> 16:48.546
I'm turning this entire wing
into a secure archive

16:48.548 --> 16:50.848
for Mr. Drake's
previous collections.

16:50.850 --> 16:53.985
It needs to be
impenetrable.

16:53.987 --> 16:56.754
For insurance
purposes, of course.

16:56.756 --> 16:59.424
I'd feel more comfortable if
we checked with the owner first.

16:59.426 --> 17:01.659
We won't say anything to him.

17:01.661 --> 17:03.561
It's a surprise.
A wedding gift.

17:03.563 --> 17:05.196
When's the happy day?

17:05.198 --> 17:07.532
I expect this all to
be done by tomorrow.

17:07.534 --> 17:09.267
(chuckles) It's gonna
take at least a week

17:09.269 --> 17:10.568
to order these parts.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.537
You got a dozen
ceiling-mounted

17:12.539 --> 17:14.405
I.P. cameras,
you got biometric...

17:14.407 --> 17:16.507
The details
don't interest me, boo.

17:16.509 --> 17:18.776
Results are the only thing
that matters.

17:18.778 --> 17:19.944
What you're asking
is impossible.

17:19.946 --> 17:21.846
MARCH: "In order
to attain the impossible,

17:21.848 --> 17:23.514
one must attempt
the absurd."

17:23.516 --> 17:27.018
Miguel de Cervantes.

17:27.020 --> 17:29.020
Is this your decorator?

17:29.022 --> 17:30.922
I'm the silent partner.

17:30.924 --> 17:33.691
The lady has an eye
for improvements, does she not?

17:33.693 --> 17:35.126
Well, as I was
explaining,

17:35.128 --> 17:36.794
there's a lot
of moving parts.

17:36.796 --> 17:38.696
You are clouding your mind
with the inconsequential.

17:38.698 --> 17:39.864
It's quite simple.

17:39.866 --> 17:42.634
This is a load-bearing wall.

17:42.636 --> 17:43.635
Abundantly strong enough
for just about

17:43.637 --> 17:45.236
any steel you lug up here.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.071
After that, it's just a matter
of a few rivets.

17:47.073 --> 17:48.740
I have extensive
experience on this.

17:48.742 --> 17:50.208
Gather your materials
and your men,

17:50.210 --> 17:51.776
and I will guide you through it.

17:51.778 --> 17:53.478
I'll do what I can.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.079
Yes, that's the spirit!

17:55.081 --> 17:57.282
Make haste!
Much to accomplish!

18:00.987 --> 18:02.887
Don't worry
your pretty head, dear.

18:02.889 --> 18:04.889
I'll see to it
you get what you want.

18:04.891 --> 18:08.326
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?!

18:08.328 --> 18:11.229
I'd kill you if you
weren't dead already.

18:11.231 --> 18:13.164
You disgust me.

18:13.166 --> 18:16.634
You're still upset
about the dago.

18:16.636 --> 18:18.303
You screwed up, Jimmy.

18:18.305 --> 18:21.005
You robbed me of the
thing I loved the most.

18:21.007 --> 18:23.241
And now I never want
to see your pathetic,

18:23.243 --> 18:25.410
miserable face ever again.

18:25.412 --> 18:27.612
But we have an arrangement!

18:27.614 --> 18:29.747
Please.

18:29.749 --> 18:32.250
Our dinners are my sole
comfort in this stygian heap.

18:32.252 --> 18:35.386
The chamber must be completed
by tomorrow.

18:39.926 --> 18:43.261
(grunting)
You try to run, I will
kill you so fast.

18:45.498 --> 18:48.032
(knocking)

18:48.034 --> 18:50.301
What the hell?

18:50.303 --> 18:53.104
I was taught it was impolite
to visit a friend empty-handed.

18:53.106 --> 18:54.605
(grunts)
Shut up.

18:54.607 --> 18:57.175
I saw what kind
of friend you were.

18:57.177 --> 19:00.278
Oh. You're a scared
little pussy, Donovan.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.647
Couldn't find
your balls

19:02.649 --> 19:05.783
if they were dangling
by a string on her bedpost.

19:05.785 --> 19:09.320
You could never be the kind
of man I need to take her down.

19:09.322 --> 19:10.922
You're wrong.

19:14.861 --> 19:16.294
I've been newly motivated.

19:18.298 --> 19:20.198
Tell me more.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.734
I love a good
humiliation.

19:22.736 --> 19:25.903
What did she do to you
that she hasn't already done?

19:25.905 --> 19:27.505
She took me back.

19:27.507 --> 19:30.341
Yeah.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.243
The Countess told me
she made a mistake,

19:32.245 --> 19:34.011
and I was the one.

19:34.013 --> 19:37.215
Forever.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.850
We made love
like it was the first time.

19:38.852 --> 19:40.551
But you didn't
believe her.

19:40.553 --> 19:42.220
(chuckles)

19:42.222 --> 19:43.254
Oh, I did.

19:43.256 --> 19:45.790
(chuckles) I did.

19:48.862 --> 19:51.262
I wanted her even more
than I did before.

19:51.264 --> 19:53.831
Because I knew what it felt like
to live without her.

19:53.833 --> 19:55.333
And that's-that's
when I realized

19:55.335 --> 19:59.170
it was never going away--
my desperation for her.

19:59.172 --> 20:01.372
It is a horrible feeling
to have a craving

20:01.374 --> 20:02.940
that you can never satiate.

20:02.942 --> 20:04.442
It's an addiction.

20:04.444 --> 20:07.145
I've been where you are.

20:09.716 --> 20:12.283
Let me think
about where we go from here.

20:12.285 --> 20:15.052
No, it has
to be tonight.

20:15.054 --> 20:16.387
She's getting married
to Will Drake tomorrow.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.356
She's distracted.

20:18.358 --> 20:20.358
Also, I slipped
enough GHB

20:20.360 --> 20:22.193
into her drink
to knock out an elephant.

20:22.195 --> 20:24.195
This is the perfect time.

20:24.197 --> 20:27.432
Oh, you got this all planned.

20:29.969 --> 20:33.538
But... I can't pull the trigger.

20:33.540 --> 20:35.606
You know that.

20:37.477 --> 20:39.911
Well, I can appreciate a man

20:39.913 --> 20:43.481
who understands
his own weakness.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.821
Do we have a deal?

20:51.157 --> 20:52.557
(groans)

20:52.559 --> 20:55.226
Let's drink to it.

21:08.975 --> 21:12.944
You know why I want
to take The Countess down.

21:12.946 --> 21:15.813
What took you so long
to look for revenge, huh?

21:17.350 --> 21:20.051
How do I know
I can trust you?

21:21.488 --> 21:24.255
It's true.

21:24.257 --> 21:27.825
She killed my man
over 20 years ago

21:27.827 --> 21:30.127
and tossed me aside.

21:30.129 --> 21:33.531
You know the only thing
worse than heartbreak?

21:33.533 --> 21:36.033
Loneliness.

21:36.035 --> 21:39.103
Knowing that
it's never going to end.

21:42.675 --> 21:44.976
So, in my despair,

21:44.978 --> 21:47.378
I went to the only place
in the world

21:47.380 --> 21:51.682
where I knew for sure
there were people who loved me.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.559
<i> Back to the only man</i>
<i> in the world</i>

22:01.561 --> 22:04.629
<i> that I ever kneeled down for.</i>

22:24.517 --> 22:26.050
Hello, Daddy.

22:26.052 --> 22:29.820
Haven't seen you
in ten years, child.

22:29.822 --> 22:31.923
You been doing
that plastic surgery?

22:31.925 --> 22:33.357
Mm-mm.

22:33.359 --> 22:34.358
You been crying.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.359
You hurt?

22:35.361 --> 22:37.395
Only on
the inside.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.163
Real bad.

22:39.165 --> 22:41.165
Can I come in?

22:41.167 --> 22:42.633
Please?

22:44.938 --> 22:45.937
(sobs)

22:45.939 --> 22:48.372
<i> I stayed for a few months.</i>

22:48.374 --> 22:53.344
<i> Mama fed my soul, and Daddy</i>
<i> straightened me right out.</i>

22:53.346 --> 22:56.747
<i> My daddy pointed his finger at</i>
<i> me and told me what was what,</i>

22:56.749 --> 22:59.951
<i> and I felt like</i>
<i> a little girl again.</i>

22:59.953 --> 23:01.385
<i> Safe.</i>

23:01.387 --> 23:02.887
Daddy.

23:02.889 --> 23:04.589
Daddy.

23:04.591 --> 23:05.756
You all right?

23:05.758 --> 23:07.191
Oh, I...

23:07.193 --> 23:08.926
just lost my place there
for a moment.

23:08.928 --> 23:10.194
What were we talking about?

23:10.196 --> 23:11.929
(laughs)

23:11.931 --> 23:14.699
Honey, it happens
all the time now.

23:14.701 --> 23:15.933
"Cassie,
where my keys?

23:15.935 --> 23:18.369
Cassie, what day is it?"

23:18.371 --> 23:20.638
You talk to the doctor, Daddy?

23:20.640 --> 23:23.407
Huh?
Your mama is the sick one.

23:23.409 --> 23:25.876
Only room for one in the family.

23:29.749 --> 23:33.451
Daddy, let me drive you over
to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.419
I can drive myself

23:35.421 --> 23:36.821
if I want to go.

23:36.823 --> 23:39.256
And I don't.

23:39.258 --> 23:41.258
I'm fine.

23:41.260 --> 23:43.194
Okay.

23:46.833 --> 23:50.434
<i> When we lost Mama,</i>
<i> things just got worse.</i>

23:50.436 --> 23:51.836
Easy.

23:51.838 --> 23:55.272
<i> For 60 years,</i>
<i> they were married.</i>

23:55.274 --> 23:59.276
<i> Without her, his mind</i>
<i> just couldn't find a reason</i>

23:59.278 --> 24:00.945
<i> to hang on.</i>

24:00.947 --> 24:02.546
(sobbing)

24:04.150 --> 24:07.151
<i> He started to get lost</i>
<i> in his own neighborhood.</i>

24:07.153 --> 24:09.620
<i> Couldn't find the house</i>

24:09.622 --> 24:12.657
<i> for 40 years.</i>

24:12.659 --> 24:14.258
¶ ¶

24:31.177 --> 24:34.245
(door opens, closes)

24:38.484 --> 24:40.384
Daddy?

24:45.558 --> 24:48.292
(gasping)

24:49.996 --> 24:54.532
<i> To see this great man</i>
<i> laid so low.</i>

24:59.138 --> 25:01.172
It's okay.

25:01.174 --> 25:05.042
Everything's
gonna be fine.

25:14.220 --> 25:16.754
<i> I'd seen</i>
<i> what the virus had done.</i>

25:16.756 --> 25:18.055
<i> Miraculous things.</i>

25:18.057 --> 25:19.724
<i> Cuts healed.</i>

25:19.726 --> 25:23.661
<i> Broken bones mended</i>
<i> in just a few days' time.</i>

25:23.663 --> 25:26.263
<i> So why not?</i>

25:26.265 --> 25:29.533
<i> Why couldn't it also</i>
<i> bring my daddy back to me?</i>

25:29.535 --> 25:32.002
(sucking)

25:34.107 --> 25:36.107
(exhales)

25:36.109 --> 25:37.908
MAN (over TV): The forecast,
showers and thunderstorms today.

25:37.910 --> 25:41.045
(door opens, closes)

25:41.047 --> 25:44.048
Cassie?

25:44.050 --> 25:46.283
Cassie, that you?

25:46.285 --> 25:48.552
RAMONA:
<i> But neurons are not cuts,</i>

25:48.554 --> 25:52.389
<i> and a diseased brain</i>
<i> is not a broken bone.</i>

25:52.391 --> 25:54.592
<i> All the virus had done</i>

25:54.594 --> 25:57.661
<i> was stop</i>
<i> the Alzheimer's progression.</i>

25:59.265 --> 26:02.266
Mama's gone, Daddy.

26:02.268 --> 26:04.769
You know that.

26:06.706 --> 26:08.706
Who are you?

26:08.708 --> 26:11.709
It's me, Daddy.

26:11.711 --> 26:14.011
Your daughter.

26:16.415 --> 26:20.417
<i> He was in no condition</i>
<i> to hunt for himself</i>

26:20.419 --> 26:24.822
<i> or to even understand</i>
<i> what he had become.</i>

26:24.824 --> 26:27.158
<i> So I took care of him.</i>

26:27.160 --> 26:30.094
<i> I brought him back blood</i>
<i> from my kills.</i>

26:30.096 --> 26:33.497
<i> I held out hope that since</i>
<i> he wasn't getting any worse,</i>

26:33.499 --> 26:35.766
<i> maybe he'd get better.</i>

26:35.768 --> 26:37.601
<i> But he didn't get any better.</i>

26:37.603 --> 26:39.170
<i> He just stayed the same.</i>

26:39.172 --> 26:40.938
<i> We both did.</i>

26:40.940 --> 26:43.808
<i> For 20 years.</i>

26:46.979 --> 26:50.014
(glass shatters)
Daddy?! Daddy!

26:52.151 --> 26:54.752
Daddy.

26:54.754 --> 26:57.221
(TV playing quietly)

27:12.471 --> 27:16.106
<i> I couldn't let him live</i>
<i> like that,</i>

27:16.108 --> 27:18.776
<i> frozen in amber.</i>

27:18.778 --> 27:22.847
<i> So I gave him a Xanax</i>
<i> to make him calm.</i>

27:26.485 --> 27:28.485
(sobs softly)

27:28.487 --> 27:30.554
(water sloshing gently)

27:42.501 --> 27:44.969
(sobs)

27:47.473 --> 27:49.907
(crying)

27:52.812 --> 27:56.080
<i> Once he was gone,</i>

27:56.082 --> 28:00.551
I realized
that I was frozen in amber, too.

28:00.553 --> 28:05.422
Decades with my father went by
like 20 minutes.

28:05.424 --> 28:07.324
I forgot everything.

28:07.326 --> 28:09.326
Felt nothing.

28:09.328 --> 28:12.396
But a lot of things happened
in the world around me

28:12.398 --> 28:13.831
in those years.

28:13.833 --> 28:15.165
The Internet.

28:15.167 --> 28:16.700
Goddamn Hulu.

28:16.702 --> 28:17.935
My old movies

28:17.937 --> 28:19.837
streaming for free.

28:19.839 --> 28:21.438
For free?

28:21.440 --> 28:25.542
Folks started to recognize me
again on the street.

28:25.544 --> 28:28.178
I started remembering.

28:28.180 --> 28:30.247
All of it.

28:30.249 --> 28:33.784
What I had, what had
been taken from me,

28:33.786 --> 28:36.553
and what she had done to me.

28:36.555 --> 28:38.289
My daddy's body died,

28:38.291 --> 28:42.059
but the strength I took from
his breath stayed with me.

28:42.061 --> 28:47.998
And I am going to use all of it
to ruin that woman.

28:52.638 --> 28:54.705
To revenge.

28:58.577 --> 29:01.278
(sighs)

29:01.280 --> 29:02.780
To revenge.

29:14.827 --> 29:17.828
(engine idling)

29:24.971 --> 29:27.705
(doorbell rings)

29:28.674 --> 29:31.041
(door opens, closes)

29:39.585 --> 29:41.051
(car door closes)

29:46.659 --> 29:48.726
(door creaks)

29:54.667 --> 29:55.933
(door closes)

30:02.375 --> 30:04.441
¶ ¶

30:17.656 --> 30:18.689
What are you doing?

30:20.726 --> 30:22.659
Remember me, Max?

30:22.661 --> 30:24.895
I'm Dr. Lowe.

30:24.897 --> 30:26.830
Last time we saw each other
was at the hospital.

30:26.832 --> 30:29.166
You were dying from measles.

30:29.168 --> 30:30.968
I saved you
by giving you my blood.

30:30.970 --> 30:33.971
Cool. Thanks.
Who are these other kids?

30:33.973 --> 30:35.572
MAX:
They're from my class.

30:35.574 --> 30:37.074
They drank my blood.

30:37.076 --> 30:38.575
Now we're all alike.

30:38.577 --> 30:40.677
GIRL:
Are you really a doctor?

30:40.679 --> 30:42.880
We don't feel good.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.348
Don't be stupid.

30:44.350 --> 30:45.716
You don't need a doctor.

30:45.718 --> 30:47.184
You have
to drink the blood.

30:47.186 --> 30:48.819
That's how
you get better.

30:48.821 --> 30:50.754
He's a fresh
one, Madeline.

30:50.756 --> 30:52.723
Not like the
homeless guy.

30:52.725 --> 30:54.224
He tastes good.

30:54.226 --> 30:56.260
ALEX:
You killed the homeless man?

30:56.262 --> 30:58.162
It's all over the news.

30:58.164 --> 31:00.764
You can't keep doing this.
The police are gonna find you.

31:00.766 --> 31:02.399
I told you guys.

31:02.401 --> 31:04.435
This is wrong.

31:04.437 --> 31:06.103
I don't want to
kill anymore.

31:07.339 --> 31:08.739
They made me
kill my parents.

31:08.741 --> 31:10.774
JIMMY:
Duh!

31:10.776 --> 31:13.243
We ate all our parents; that's
why nobody's looking for us.

31:13.245 --> 31:14.878
I miss my mom.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.346
MAX:
Madeline,

31:16.348 --> 31:17.714
it's been,
like, four days.

31:17.716 --> 31:20.350
Your spots are coming back.
You have to drink.

31:20.352 --> 31:22.786
All of you.

31:26.692 --> 31:29.126
No.

31:30.296 --> 31:32.729
You're burning up.

31:32.731 --> 31:35.566
Listen, we should
just off them.

31:35.568 --> 31:37.234
All the sickies.

31:37.236 --> 31:38.635
The only reason they're alive is

31:38.637 --> 31:40.070
because you have
a crush on Madeline.

31:40.072 --> 31:41.538
Shut up, Jimmy.

31:41.540 --> 31:43.373
Dude, don't use
my real name.

31:43.375 --> 31:45.042
Now she knows
who I am!

31:45.044 --> 31:47.311
Pretty soon, everybody's
gonna know who you are.

31:47.313 --> 31:49.246
You killed
the pizza delivery guy.

31:49.248 --> 31:50.814
In about 30 minutes,
they're gonna know

31:50.816 --> 31:52.816
he went missing.
They have your address.

31:52.818 --> 31:54.751
The cops are gonna come
right here to the house.

31:54.753 --> 31:57.121
Come with me, all of you,
to the Hotel Cortez.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.989
There are people there like us.

31:58.991 --> 32:01.425
They'll know how to fix this.
MAX: Right.

32:01.427 --> 32:04.928
'Cause that's what we need--
adults telling us what to do.

32:04.930 --> 32:06.997
Screw that.

32:06.999 --> 32:08.765
Listen, we have
half an hour.

32:08.767 --> 32:10.567
We can get out of here.

32:10.569 --> 32:13.270
It's just... what about her?

32:13.272 --> 32:14.271
(metallic swish)

32:14.273 --> 32:17.241
You made the rule, Max.

32:17.243 --> 32:18.842
Nobody leaves us alive.

32:18.844 --> 32:20.777
No!

32:20.779 --> 32:22.946
She made us.

32:22.948 --> 32:25.749
She can leave.

32:25.751 --> 32:27.284
Come with me to the hotel.

32:27.286 --> 32:28.485
I said leave!

32:28.487 --> 32:29.653
I can help you!

32:29.655 --> 32:31.655
Fine. We're leaving.

32:31.657 --> 32:33.023
You explain it
to the cops.

32:42.668 --> 32:44.701
(door creaks)

32:47.806 --> 32:49.840
She's still out.

32:49.842 --> 32:52.543
She probably won't
feel anything.

32:52.545 --> 32:54.678
That's too bad.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.713
My only regret

32:56.715 --> 32:58.649
is that she won't know
what's coming

32:58.651 --> 33:00.651
and who's giving it to her.

33:00.653 --> 33:02.853
What are you gonna do?

33:02.855 --> 33:04.821
RAMONA: I'm gonna stab her
in the heart, and then

33:04.823 --> 33:06.623
cut off her head.

33:06.625 --> 33:08.859
Make sure she stays dead.

33:08.861 --> 33:11.361
What do you
want me to do?

33:11.363 --> 33:13.063
Watch.

33:13.065 --> 33:17.367
See how someone with cojones
finishes the job.

33:26.579 --> 33:27.578
(hissing)

33:27.580 --> 33:29.713
(Ramona gasps)

33:29.715 --> 33:31.882
(groans)
Ballsy enough for you?

33:31.884 --> 33:34.251
IRIS:<i> Donovan,</i>
<i> I don't understand this.</i>

33:34.253 --> 33:36.520
We're using her as bait?

33:36.522 --> 33:39.823
Did she agree to this?

33:39.825 --> 33:41.658
Is this plan "B"?

33:41.660 --> 33:43.860
There is no plan "B."

33:43.862 --> 33:46.430
Well, then what
are we doing?

33:46.432 --> 33:49.433
What are all these cameras for?

33:49.435 --> 33:53.670
We are collecting our enemies
and putting them in here.

33:53.672 --> 33:55.172
(chuckles)

33:55.174 --> 33:57.708
We're gonna hate-watch.

33:57.710 --> 34:00.410
<i>Our</i> enemies?

34:00.412 --> 34:03.580
You mean her enemies, don't you?

34:03.582 --> 34:06.450
Her enemies
<i> are</i> my enemies.

34:06.452 --> 34:08.585
Aw, shit.

34:08.587 --> 34:10.120
God, Donovan.

34:10.122 --> 34:12.522
She loves me, Iris.

34:12.524 --> 34:14.091
And I never stopped
loving her.

34:14.093 --> 34:16.793
Anyone who's against us
is gonna end up in here,

34:16.795 --> 34:18.729
so just keep
that in mind.

34:18.731 --> 34:21.465
There is no us with that bitch.

34:21.467 --> 34:24.868
It's just her and surviving

34:24.870 --> 34:27.371
until she decides it's
time for you to die!

34:27.373 --> 34:29.706
The three of us, together--

34:29.708 --> 34:32.876
it's the only chance
we have to destroy her.

34:32.878 --> 34:36.580
Did you really think the three
of us could ever be partners?

34:36.582 --> 34:38.315
Well, then why did you save me?

34:38.317 --> 34:40.817
I was weak.

34:40.819 --> 34:42.653
I should have
let you die.

34:42.655 --> 34:45.489
(sighs)

34:45.491 --> 34:47.391
No.

34:47.393 --> 34:50.227
You're the one
who's gonna die, son.

34:51.730 --> 34:53.330
You should listen to your mama.

34:53.332 --> 34:55.265
She's right.

34:55.267 --> 34:56.967
Shut up.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.835
Shut up!

34:58.837 --> 35:00.771
Go.

35:00.773 --> 35:03.507
You think
you're her one and only?

35:03.509 --> 35:04.941
That's what you think?

35:04.943 --> 35:07.077
She's already moved on

35:07.079 --> 35:09.446
to the next one;
you can count on it.

35:09.448 --> 35:11.114
You don't know that,

35:11.116 --> 35:12.449
then you're more dumb

35:12.451 --> 35:14.584
than you are pretty.

35:14.586 --> 35:18.989
And you are<i> very</i> pretty.

35:21.493 --> 35:24.361
VALENTINO:<i> It is a world</i>
<i> I no longer recognize</i>

35:24.363 --> 35:28.332
and which no longer
recognizes me.

35:28.334 --> 35:31.168
Anonymity is
your friend.

35:31.170 --> 35:33.270
To survive, we
must be cunning

35:33.272 --> 35:35.272
and stick to
the shadows.

35:35.274 --> 35:38.542
Natacha does not
see it that way.

35:38.544 --> 35:40.444
She has been drawn in
by the future.

35:40.446 --> 35:43.547
This modern world
speaks to her.

35:43.549 --> 35:44.948
I haven't even seen her

35:44.950 --> 35:46.983
since you gave her
that black plastic card.

35:46.985 --> 35:51.121
She speaks of nothing
but shopping and... Uber.

35:51.123 --> 35:54.024
She's costing
me a fortune.

35:54.026 --> 35:56.526
But it's worth
it, I'll admit.

35:56.528 --> 35:59.496
I did it so I could
have you all to myself.

35:59.498 --> 36:01.365
But I thought you loved Natacha.

36:01.367 --> 36:03.200
I loved her
because you did.

36:03.202 --> 36:09.172
And because I was young and
lacking in self-confidence.

36:09.174 --> 36:12.209
I thought I wasn't
woman enough for you.

36:12.211 --> 36:14.478
<i>Bellissima...</i>

36:14.480 --> 36:17.147
you are woman enough
for the both of us.

36:17.149 --> 36:21.518
When I look at you, I see
something of my vanished world.

36:21.520 --> 36:24.221
We can have that world again.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.756
No.

36:27.693 --> 36:29.059
It is lost.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.994
There is no place for
enchantment anymore.

36:30.996 --> 36:32.429
We can make a place.

36:32.431 --> 36:34.598
We can create one.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.400
God knows I've been trying

36:36.402 --> 36:38.702
to recreate you
for the last century.

36:38.704 --> 36:43.006
A series of pale imitations,
gone, or soon to be.

36:43.008 --> 36:45.442
I don't understand.

36:45.444 --> 36:48.178
I've been clearing
the way for us.

36:48.180 --> 36:52.682
We are so close to recapturing
what we once lost.

36:52.684 --> 36:55.018
I'm about to come into
a great deal of money.

36:55.020 --> 36:57.954
We can use it
to turn the Cortez

36:57.956 --> 37:00.924
into a fortress
against the modern world.

37:00.926 --> 37:03.860
A world I hate
even more than you.

37:03.862 --> 37:05.562
And what of Natacha?

37:05.564 --> 37:09.766
If something were
to happen to her...

37:09.768 --> 37:12.135
could you go on?

37:12.137 --> 37:15.372
I would have you
to comfort me.

37:17.810 --> 37:20.143
(door opens)

37:20.145 --> 37:22.245
Little Mouse!

37:22.247 --> 37:24.281
You were so right.

37:24.283 --> 37:27.417
It's astounding what's become
of dusty Beverly Hills.

37:27.419 --> 37:30.220
Shops, shops and more shops.

37:30.222 --> 37:32.322
Rudy, you won't believe
what I found.

37:32.324 --> 37:34.991
A store with your name on it--
"Valentino."

37:34.993 --> 37:36.593
Hmm.

37:36.595 --> 37:38.328
Retail's all well and good,
but for the true couture,

37:38.330 --> 37:39.796
you have to come to my place.

37:39.798 --> 37:41.465
Are you mad?

37:41.467 --> 37:43.233
I'm never stepping foot
in the Cortez again.

37:43.235 --> 37:44.634
James March
is long dead.

37:44.636 --> 37:46.336
You're perfectly safe.

37:46.338 --> 37:49.673
I'll have a car come
pick you up later.

37:52.077 --> 37:54.444
Oh, and, Rudy,
you're not invited.

37:54.446 --> 37:56.613
It's just us
girls tonight.

37:56.615 --> 37:58.081
(chuckles)

38:00.652 --> 38:02.853
(door opens, closes)

38:22.941 --> 38:25.041
If anyone present
knows any reason why

38:25.043 --> 38:27.944
this man and this woman should
not be joined in marriage,

38:27.946 --> 38:30.313
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

38:30.315 --> 38:32.315
Uh... yeah.

38:32.317 --> 38:34.551
Because she's a bitch

38:34.553 --> 38:36.786
with no conscience,
no mercy,

38:36.788 --> 38:38.655
no soul.

38:38.657 --> 38:40.790
(chuckles):
Oh, Liz.

38:40.792 --> 38:42.626
Ignore her. She drinks.

38:42.628 --> 38:44.728
But the law requires a witness.

38:44.730 --> 38:46.029
And I've witnessed plenty.

38:46.031 --> 38:47.397
Please proceed.

38:47.399 --> 38:49.466
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

38:49.468 --> 38:50.867
You may kiss the bride.

38:50.869 --> 38:52.802
(both laugh)

38:54.506 --> 38:57.507
My men, my family.

38:57.509 --> 39:01.578
I am so happy to finally be
Mrs. Will Drake.

39:01.580 --> 39:03.880
Dad, can I go
upstairs now?

39:03.882 --> 39:05.148
Of course you may.

39:05.150 --> 39:07.250
And I am going to go upstairs

39:07.252 --> 39:09.686
and change out of this
beautiful gown you've made me

39:09.688 --> 39:11.588
and put on
my traveling clothes.

39:11.590 --> 39:14.090
You sure you don't want to have
a drink to celebrate first?

39:14.092 --> 39:16.426
That's what
the honeymoon is for.

39:16.428 --> 39:19.729
I'd like to get that started.
Well, I think I'm going to.

39:19.731 --> 39:22.832
Your wife finds no reason
to object, and you own the bar.

39:22.834 --> 39:24.100
Ah.

39:34.179 --> 39:37.347
My darling Liz.

39:37.349 --> 39:39.449
These are for you,

39:39.451 --> 39:44.187
with my genuine hope that
you someday find true love.

39:44.189 --> 39:46.456
One never knows
when it may appear.

39:51.463 --> 39:54.631
("Fade to Grey" by Visage
playing)

39:54.633 --> 39:58.902
¶ One man on a lonely platform ¶

39:58.904 --> 40:03.106
¶ One case sitting by his side ¶

40:03.108 --> 40:06.977
¶ Two eyes
staring cold and silent ¶

40:06.979 --> 40:09.946
¶ Show fear
as he turns to hide... ¶

40:09.948 --> 40:14.384
Ah, yes! A toast
to the guide of Cortez.

40:14.386 --> 40:17.120
Or as some folks called her,
the bride of Cortez.

40:17.122 --> 40:19.155
March is the name.
Longtime resident.

40:19.157 --> 40:20.657
Call me James.

40:20.659 --> 40:22.325
Mind if I join you?

40:22.327 --> 40:25.228
I understand, uh,
congratulations are in order.

40:25.230 --> 40:26.896
They are indeed, James.

40:26.898 --> 40:28.898
Let's toast
to your good fortune, hmm?

40:28.900 --> 40:31.101
I wouldn't suppose
you have an Armagnac?

40:31.103 --> 40:34.904
I, uh, suspect you do.

40:36.975 --> 40:39.409
Ah.

40:43.148 --> 40:45.148
Here's to new worlds
to conquer.

40:45.150 --> 40:47.717
I will drink to that.

40:49.621 --> 40:51.621
(sighs):
Ah, yes.

40:51.623 --> 40:55.425
We are led by the women
in our lives, are we not?

40:55.427 --> 40:56.626
You know The Countess?

40:56.628 --> 40:58.828
Acquainted, yes.
I never thought

40:58.830 --> 41:00.797
I was the marrying kind,

41:00.799 --> 41:04.434
and now I get to call
that woman my wife.

41:04.436 --> 41:07.303
(laughs)

41:07.305 --> 41:11.675
Felicitations
to the happy couple.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.443
I must commend you.

41:13.445 --> 41:16.346
A blended family
is terribly progressive.

41:16.348 --> 41:17.614
I'm very lucky.

41:17.616 --> 41:19.182
She loves my son
very much.

41:19.184 --> 41:22.318
I, uh...

41:22.320 --> 41:25.221
wasn't referring to your son.

41:25.223 --> 41:27.957
¶ Ah, we fade to grey. ¶

41:29.161 --> 41:31.294
(door creaks)

41:31.296 --> 41:33.163
Initially,
I had my doubts

41:33.165 --> 41:35.699
the child was of my
own flesh and blood.

41:35.701 --> 41:39.235
You see, he doesn't bear any of
the distinctive March features.

41:39.237 --> 41:42.005
Diamond jaw,
strong, piercing eyes.

41:42.007 --> 41:44.674
A flair for
the dramatic.

41:44.676 --> 41:46.242
He has quite a
delicate temperament,

41:46.244 --> 41:47.577
as you'll get to know.

41:47.579 --> 41:49.179
(quiet growling)

41:49.181 --> 41:52.582
Except when
he's feeding.

41:52.584 --> 41:53.983
In that regard,
he most certainly

41:53.985 --> 41:55.351
takes after his mother.

41:55.353 --> 41:57.554
Holy shit!
What the hell is that thing?

41:57.556 --> 41:58.988
COUNTESS:
And to think,

41:58.990 --> 42:01.691
I was prepared
to love and raise<i> your</i> son.

42:01.693 --> 42:03.927
What is going on?

42:03.929 --> 42:06.396
What is this-- some,
some sort of prank?

42:06.398 --> 42:08.598
That thing can't be yours.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.667
It doesn't even look human.

42:10.669 --> 42:12.602
I thought to kill you in Paris,

42:12.604 --> 42:15.071
but I could never stomach
traveling with someone

42:15.073 --> 42:19.576
who said such hateful things
about my child.

42:22.013 --> 42:26.149
I am going to make sure
<i>you</i> suffer, immensely.

42:28.086 --> 42:29.919
(chuckles softly)

42:37.062 --> 42:39.395
RAMONA:
Hey.

42:39.397 --> 42:42.966
Hey.

42:42.968 --> 42:44.467
Are you okay?

42:44.469 --> 42:47.237
Where the hell are we?
Who are you?

42:47.239 --> 42:49.572
One of her victims.

42:49.574 --> 42:50.940
(groans)

42:50.942 --> 42:52.108
Just like you.

42:52.110 --> 42:53.877
(groans)

42:53.879 --> 42:56.379
Uh, this... this is insane.

42:56.381 --> 42:58.281
This can't be real.

42:58.283 --> 43:01.818
You're about to find out
just how real it is,

43:01.820 --> 43:03.453
when they come back down here

43:03.455 --> 43:05.989
and stick you in
that other one.

43:05.991 --> 43:10.326
Please...
get me out of this.

43:10.328 --> 43:12.295
Please!

43:12.297 --> 43:15.064
(panting)

43:15.066 --> 43:17.433
There's a handle
in the back.

43:17.435 --> 43:19.469
Yeah.

43:19.471 --> 43:21.538
(groans):
Oh.

43:24.276 --> 43:26.142
(metallic creaking)
Oh!

43:26.144 --> 43:28.211
(panting)

43:31.750 --> 43:33.516
All right.

43:33.518 --> 43:35.952
All right, it's
gonna be okay.
Oh.

43:35.954 --> 43:38.521
There's got to be
a way out of here.

43:39.624 --> 43:41.090
(sighs)

43:49.467 --> 43:51.467
Hello?!

43:51.469 --> 43:53.536
Is anybody there?!

43:57.475 --> 43:59.475
Help!

43:59.477 --> 44:02.846
Let us out of here!

44:04.983 --> 44:06.716
Help!

44:06.718 --> 44:08.184
Jesus, I think it's soundproof.

44:08.186 --> 44:11.187
No one even knows
we're here.

44:11.189 --> 44:13.022
We'll starve.

44:13.024 --> 44:15.024
I won't.

44:17.495 --> 44:19.996
(gurgling)

44:19.998 --> 44:23.299
(Ramona yelling, Will groaning)

44:32.244 --> 44:34.244
(sobs):
Help me.

44:34.246 --> 44:36.312
Please.

44:36.314 --> 44:38.314
(grunting, gurgling)
