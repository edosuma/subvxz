11:36.696 --> 11:37.653
- Feels good, Earl.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.047
How often do I gas it?

11:40.090 --> 11:41.439
- You don't gas this baby.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.833
Like us, you 151 proof it.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.182
You rocket fuel it!

11:45.226 --> 11:46.401
Fill it up with high octane,

11:46.444 --> 11:47.707
throw in a bottle of my booster.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.621
It'll take ya to
heaven and back.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.188
- It better.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.800
Wouldn't wanna be caught
 there one way with no return.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.236
- Yeah, heaven's for the angels,

11:55.279 --> 11:57.194
not for the likes
 of us, huh, Chase?

11:57.238 --> 11:59.588
Hey, by the way, this
 ain't legal, you know.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.069
- How much do I owe you?

12:02.112 --> 12:04.549
- Well, if the department's
 paying for it, top price.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.769
If you're paying for
 it, it's on the house.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.075
- Thanks, Earl.

12:08.118 --> 12:11.121
Do the usual, call me
if there's another war.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.340
[laughs]

12:12.383 --> 12:13.733
- You're the best.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.735
I can always count
 on you, Chase.

12:15.778 --> 12:18.259
You're my Southern buddy y'all,

12:18.302 --> 12:21.523
if you were from the
 South, South Bronx that is.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.661
[sirens blaring]

12:32.708 --> 12:33.840
[tires screeching]

12:33.883 --> 12:34.710
- Fuckin' get his ass, man.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.104
Bust his fuckin' balls!

12:37.147 --> 12:38.279
Bunch of bullshit!

12:41.412 --> 12:43.414
- Hey, Twiddle Dumb
 and Twiddle Dumber!

12:43.458 --> 12:44.807
How you guys doin'?

12:44.851 --> 12:46.461
- That was hysterical
 last night, Chase.

12:46.504 --> 12:47.592
- Don't you guys
 got somethin' better

12:47.636 --> 12:48.855
to do than to follow me around?

12:48.898 --> 12:50.247
- You know, I gotta
tell you somethin', man.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.814
You got some fuckin' brass
 balls, you know that?

12:51.858 --> 12:53.903
'Cause we're gonna tell him
 that you fucking set us up.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.731
- I think that maybe
 the two of you gotta

12:55.775 --> 12:56.993
get yourself a
girlfriend or something,

12:57.037 --> 12:58.299
you know what I mean?
 - Oh yeah, right.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.517
But I think I'm in
 love with you, Chase.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.345
You know, your beautiful
blond hair, man.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.259
Your hair comes alive.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.609
Get a haircut, would you please?

13:04.653 --> 13:06.046
- Oh, shit.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.483
My worst fuckin' nightmare,
 another empty beer can.

13:10.746 --> 13:13.749
- Can't we bust him for
drinking in public or somethin'?

13:14.663 --> 13:16.186
Whoa, yes indeed.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.362
Hey, it must be jelly
 'cause jam don't--

13:18.406 --> 13:19.537
- [Woman] Fuck you, Dana.

13:19.581 --> 13:23.628
- Shake like that.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.805
Yeah, she wants me.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.154
- You're beautiful.

13:27.197 --> 13:27.981
- Thank you.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.681
[beeping]

13:33.725 --> 13:35.292
- Yo, Chase.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.685
- Tell me something, is this
 where my tax money's going to,

13:36.728 --> 13:38.513
for these new high-falluting
 security systems.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.602
'Cause I think it sucks.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.126
Have a good afternoon, George,

13:43.170 --> 13:44.867
and keep your hands
 off of my beer.

13:47.174 --> 13:50.612
- Hey, hey, it's super cop.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.396
Didn't you ever learn
 not to turn your back

13:52.440 --> 13:54.007
on the enemy, huh?

13:54.050 --> 13:56.574
- You guys are too stupid
 to be called my enemy.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.670
- How's your sex life, Houdini?

14:05.714 --> 14:08.760
- Yeah, I heard your
 dick disappeared.

14:08.804 --> 14:11.241
Blub, blub, blub, bleeb, presto!

14:11.285 --> 14:13.722
- Chicks must really
 love that S&M shit!

14:13.765 --> 14:15.942
Especially with you being the
 one wearing the blindfold!

14:15.985 --> 14:17.944
[laughing]

14:17.987 --> 14:20.163
- For Christ's sake,
 straighten your tie a bit.

14:20.207 --> 14:23.819
What'll he think,
 Lieutenant's coming.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.213
Morning, Lieutenant.

14:26.256 --> 14:27.779
- Hey, guys.
 - Morning to you.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.999
- Good morning.
- Heya doin'?

14:30.043 --> 14:31.783
- Lieutenant.

14:31.827 --> 14:32.872
- Good morning, Lieutenant,

14:32.915 --> 14:34.090
you're looking
 very chipper today.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.657
That tie is a very nice--
 - Fuck off!

14:36.876 --> 14:38.442
- You hear anything new
in that stripper case?

14:38.486 --> 14:40.488
- The less we hear
 about it, the better.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.621
[belching loudly]

14:43.665 --> 14:44.448
- That's lovely.

14:45.536 --> 14:46.711
- Those burritos were good.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.987
- Chase doesn't have any
 sense of smell, remember?

15:04.468 --> 15:05.905
Just go ahead and fart.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.692
Come on
- Get started, come on.

15:19.744 --> 15:20.745
- Hey, I'm trying.

15:20.789 --> 15:21.877
It's got nowhere to go.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.186
[gurgling]

15:28.840 --> 15:31.147
[laughing]

15:35.630 --> 15:37.675
- He's not deaf, you guys.

15:38.546 --> 15:41.462
[elevator ringing]

15:47.120 --> 15:48.773
- Let's get outta here, guys.

15:48.817 --> 15:52.864
Chase's stench is
 killing me, oh god.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.431
- That funny a joke?

15:55.693 --> 15:58.348
- You ever think about
 getting that thing fixed?

15:58.392 --> 16:00.655
Here, your gonna need that.

16:08.532 --> 16:09.881
- Ooh, hot in here.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.983
- Nothing like the smell
of a beautiful lady

16:24.026 --> 16:26.594
lavished in lust.
 [elevator rings]

16:26.637 --> 16:27.421
Excuse me.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.821
- You've been costing the
 department too much money.

16:36.865 --> 16:39.694
I'm assigning you a
 second pair of eyes.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.000
- What?

16:41.043 --> 16:43.828
A partner, me, moi?

16:44.786 --> 16:47.528
Is this coming from
 the masturbating duo?

16:47.571 --> 16:49.878
- Dana and Kyle have nothing
 to do with this, Chase.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.533
- Hey look, Chief, you know
 I always make good, right?

16:53.751 --> 16:55.579
- All right, look, the
 perps might have gotten away

16:55.623 --> 16:57.277
but I nicked one
 of 'em really good.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.540
He's gonna be leaving a trail
 of blood wherever he goes.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.932
All you gotta do is
 send out the hounds

17:00.976 --> 17:02.325
and you'll find him
 licking his wounds.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.501
- No no no no no.

17:04.545 --> 17:07.069
It's been too much,
 too often, it's final.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.723
As of now, you're
 gonna have a partner

17:08.766 --> 17:11.247
to slow you down and keep
 you in the traffic lanes.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.291
You got that?

17:12.335 --> 17:13.771
- This just came in.

17:15.512 --> 17:16.905
Hey, Chase.

17:16.948 --> 17:17.819
- Hey, Kelly.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.214
- You been drinking again?

17:21.257 --> 17:22.954
Smell yourself,
 you smell terrible.

17:24.955 --> 17:27.175
- [Secretary] Captain,
 Sergeant Kuluhan is here.

17:28.786 --> 17:29.831
- Okay, great.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.791
Now, look, Chase, don't
scare this one away.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.315
We're talking first
 rate credentials here.

17:35.358 --> 17:36.881
Top of the class.

17:36.925 --> 17:40.102
Narcotics, homicide,
 firearms, special tactics.

17:40.146 --> 17:43.845
Expert in Taekwondo,
 judo, you name it.

17:43.888 --> 17:44.846
- Are you kidding me?

17:44.889 --> 17:46.065
Who is this, Rambo?

17:48.023 --> 17:49.285
- Chief, I'm outta
 here, I'm history.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.766
Hasta la vista, baby, I'm gone.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.898
Call me if the going
 gets rough, all right?

17:55.683 --> 17:58.381
[romantic music]

18:02.603 --> 18:05.040
Big mistake, I think I'll
 stick around for a while.

18:06.215 --> 18:07.825
- Of course.

18:07.869 --> 18:12.787
Sergeant Kuluhan, this
is Detective Chase Nash.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.181
He's got a foul tongue,
but a sweet heart

18:15.224 --> 18:16.747
once you get to know him.

18:17.618 --> 18:18.793
- Yes, we met.

18:18.836 --> 18:22.492
- Tight buns, nice
 to see you again.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.017
Oh!

18:27.932 --> 18:28.977
- You'll have to
 excuse him, Sergeant.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.239
He's a bit off
 balance on account

18:30.283 --> 18:32.415
of a bad decision he
was just about to make.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.591
Luckily, something brought
 him back to his senses.

18:34.635 --> 18:37.028
- Actually, two things
 brought me back to my senses.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.682
- Do you think that's enough
 of a feel, Detective Nash?

18:38.726 --> 18:40.293
- Oh yeah, sure.

18:40.336 --> 18:41.642
Unless you want me to take off
 your shirt and do it right.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.122
- That's enough, Chase.

18:44.688 --> 18:47.126
I'm assigning the two of
 you on to the stripper case.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.344
- The stripper case.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.216
That's the hauling
 out bodies, isn't it?

18:50.259 --> 18:52.000
- Sounds like it's
 right up your alley.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.219
- Oh, you're funny.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.524
I've had my share of
full bodies, thank you.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.309
I'm not deprived, like you.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.049
- Oh, what makes you
 think I'm deprived?

18:58.093 --> 18:59.660
- Very obvious.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.575
The way you hold your body
 so stiff and defensive-like.

19:01.618 --> 19:02.924
- Ever occur to you
 that maybe women

19:02.967 --> 19:04.186
like me just don't
 like men like you.

19:04.230 --> 19:07.015
- Never thought of that.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.103
Got myself a nun.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.801
- Do you mind, Chase?

19:10.845 --> 19:12.934
- Now so far we got
 Special Tactics, the FBI,

19:12.977 --> 19:16.590
Vicap, and even the
 CIA in on this one.

19:16.633 --> 19:17.895
The whole thing's
 getting worse and

19:17.939 --> 19:19.462
we're not getting any better.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.072
What we have here is a precedent

19:21.116 --> 19:23.901
in criminal
 investigation history.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.903
Now I wouldn't even think
 about screwing it up any worse

19:25.947 --> 19:30.952
by sending you in, Chase,
 but, hell, I still owe ya.

19:32.258 --> 19:36.000
Now maybe, just maybe, with
 the class of Sergeant Kuluhan

19:36.044 --> 19:39.047
beside you you might get
it straight this time.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.701
- Well, we'll look good anyway.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.965
Sounds good to me, Chief.

19:44.008 --> 19:46.228
We'll have it bagged tight and
 cleaned up in a couple days.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.055
Right, Sarge?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.275
- You watch yourself,
 Detective Nash,

19:49.318 --> 19:51.799
and we'll just do fine together.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.931
- Ooh, I got myself a live one.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.542
- Don't worry, I'll
 take care of it.

19:55.585 --> 19:58.588
- Let me escort you
 outside, if you don't mind.

19:58.632 --> 19:59.415
Whoa!

20:00.590 --> 20:01.461
I mean, don't touch
 the merchandise.

20:01.504 --> 20:02.636
Can I just look at it?

20:04.812 --> 20:06.117
Chief.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.163
First I gotta bag
 Sergeant Stuck-up

20:08.207 --> 20:09.425
then I'll solve the case.

20:09.469 --> 20:10.296
- Chase!

20:15.779 --> 20:18.260
- So what did the chief
mean by still owing you?

20:18.304 --> 20:20.523
- A lot of people owe me, Sarge,

20:20.567 --> 20:23.091
but not many people pay me back.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.662
[elevator rings]
- Hold it!

20:28.705 --> 20:29.924
We don't wanna go in there.

20:29.967 --> 20:33.319
This one's filled with
 four big assholes.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.107
[laughs]

20:39.150 --> 20:41.109
- That was great, that
 was great, Sergeant!

20:41.152 --> 20:42.632
You see the expressions
on their faces?

20:42.676 --> 20:43.981
It was like they
 saw the Grim Reaper!

20:44.025 --> 20:45.113
I'm telling you, me and you,

20:45.156 --> 20:46.593
we got a great future--
- Hold it!

20:46.636 --> 20:49.248
Look, Detective, we
owe each other nothing.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.075
That was only spur
 of the moment destiny

20:51.119 --> 20:53.513
back there shining it's
benevolence upon you.

20:59.388 --> 21:00.868
- Gosh, what a lucky guy.

21:01.999 --> 21:04.350
I definitely see a
grandiose destiny ahead

21:04.393 --> 21:05.786
for the two of us.

21:07.483 --> 21:10.181
[sirens blaring]

21:27.068 --> 21:30.027
[dramatic music]

21:35.642 --> 21:37.208
Hey, Sloppy Joe.

21:38.035 --> 21:38.949
What's going down here?

21:38.993 --> 21:40.516
- You don't wanna see it, Chase.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.909
It'll make you throw up.

21:41.952 --> 21:43.214
- It's all right,
 I didn't eat yet.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.607
What is it?

21:44.651 --> 21:46.653
- Yuck, looks like
 something from outer space.

21:46.696 --> 21:50.091
Welcome to the
 stripper case, Kiddo.

21:50.134 --> 21:52.354
Ho, hey, I like
 your new partner!

21:52.398 --> 21:55.226
- [Dispatcher] 10-4, under
 the Fifth Street Bridge.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.924
Sightings of stripper victims.

21:56.967 --> 21:58.839
Keep vicinity on lock down.

21:58.882 --> 22:00.101
- Hey, Chase, smile!

22:00.144 --> 22:02.233
You're on fuckin'
Candid Camera from Mars!

22:03.060 --> 22:04.758
- Hey, that's my bad side.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.063
- Every side is your
 bad side, asshole.

22:06.107 --> 22:07.848
- It wasn't their lucky day.

22:07.891 --> 22:10.241
- [Dispatcher] Department
 of Health notified.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.287
May need quarantine.

22:13.462 --> 22:17.161
No body fluids or organs
thought to exist in the bodies.

22:17.205 --> 22:19.294
Checking for radioactivity.

22:20.513 --> 22:23.733
- I tried to tell them
 that crime don't pay.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.256
- That's your hit?

22:25.300 --> 22:26.823
- Yup.

22:26.867 --> 22:30.131
Looks like somebody big and
bad finished the job also, huh?

22:30.174 --> 22:32.394
- There's nothing to
 take fingerprints of.

22:32.438 --> 22:35.179
Christ, even the
 fingerprints are gone.

22:35.223 --> 22:36.485
- Something's going
 down all right.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.095
There's no telling how
 long they've been dead

22:38.139 --> 22:40.228
without organs or
 internal liquids.

22:40.271 --> 22:43.274
I don't know who's
 dong this or how.

22:44.188 --> 22:45.538
I'm betting it's arcane.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.368
- Well, Sarge, let's
 look at the upside.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.239
They nailed the bad guy.

22:52.501 --> 22:55.635
The other stripper victims
 were also sought after perps.

22:55.678 --> 22:58.159
So who's ever plying voodoo
 seems to be on our side.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.336
- Yeah, for now.

23:02.990 --> 23:06.210
- [Dispatcher] All personnel,
 do not make physical contact

23:06.254 --> 23:09.910
with the victims, radioactivity
and contamination possible.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.008
[sighs]

23:21.051 --> 23:23.750
- Been in this business
 for 25 years and I've seen

23:23.793 --> 23:26.361
more twisted bodies then
worms in the ground.

23:27.928 --> 23:29.712
Doesn't make sense.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.192
There was no entry,

23:32.411 --> 23:35.936
therefore, logically,
there should be no exit.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.329
- But we do have a hollow body.

23:38.373 --> 23:39.156
- Body?

23:43.334 --> 23:44.118
Bodies!

23:45.641 --> 23:47.295
Why don't you get
 more bicycle pumps

23:47.338 --> 23:50.080
so I can pump 'em up to see
 what they used to look like!

23:51.299 --> 23:54.171
Definitely not death
 by natural causes.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.915
Chase, what's going on here?

23:58.959 --> 24:02.179
I'm not a religious man, but
 if you do not wrap this up

24:02.223 --> 24:05.008
real soon, I'm taking
 up the good book

24:05.052 --> 24:07.968
and I'm not talking
 about Gray's Anatomy.

24:24.158 --> 24:26.856
[dramatic music]

24:28.467 --> 24:29.642
[infant crying]

24:29.685 --> 24:32.383
[bullets firing]

24:33.863 --> 24:36.823
- How's your head
 feel now, super cop?

24:36.866 --> 24:38.564
- Yeah, told you he didn't
 have any brain in there.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.391
[guns firing]

24:40.435 --> 24:42.437
- Hey, take two aspirin.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.224
And don't ever
 fucking call me again.

25:19.256 --> 25:20.475
- I just love being me.

25:22.346 --> 25:26.307
- [Announcer] Detective
 Chase and Sergeant Madison.

25:26.350 --> 25:27.656
- Madison, yeah, first
 class all the way.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.310
That's what I said.

25:29.353 --> 25:32.226
- Anything compared to you is
 first class, Detective Nash.

25:32.269 --> 25:33.575
- Oh ho ho, real cute.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.142
I told you you're cute.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.926
- Hey, Martin, how
 is it out there?

25:36.970 --> 25:38.449
- Hard, it's really
 tough out there.

25:38.493 --> 25:39.581
- Any tricks?

25:42.671 --> 25:45.674
- Okay, Madison, ready
 to rock and roll?

25:45.718 --> 25:48.329
Okay, tally-ho, let's go.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.549
Madison, if you'll accompany me.

25:50.592 --> 25:51.985
Let's check out this area.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.437
Hey, Sarge.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.918
Anybody ever tell you you
 look really sexy in uniform?

26:11.961 --> 26:13.833
I can't concentrate on anything.

26:13.876 --> 26:14.747
- You know, if I
 were you, Detective,

26:14.790 --> 26:16.487
I'd keep my attention elsewhere.

26:18.054 --> 26:20.579
[gun blasting]

26:23.320 --> 26:24.539
- Good God.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.627
Gosh, just having
 you near me makes me

26:25.671 --> 26:28.151
all hot and flustered
 like, Sarge.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.892
- Oh yeah?

26:29.936 --> 26:32.678
Well, go home and take a
 shower, I'll finish up here.

26:40.468 --> 26:43.036
[guns blasting]

26:57.224 --> 26:59.835
- Hey, not bad, not bad,
but some like it hot.

26:59.879 --> 27:00.880
I hear somebody else.

27:02.446 --> 27:05.101
One down, let's see
 who else is left.

27:06.059 --> 27:11.064
No, no!
 [gun basting]

27:11.717 --> 27:13.501
And some like it hotter.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.895
Oh boy, I gotta get a hold
 here, he almost got us.

27:18.549 --> 27:20.029
- A knight in shining armor?

27:31.171 --> 27:33.652
[gun blasting]

27:45.054 --> 27:46.752
- When the going gets tougher,

27:46.795 --> 27:48.797
the tougher gotta
 get going, Madison.

27:48.841 --> 27:52.148
I don't wanna spook you, so
 close your eyes on this one.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.386
[shouting]

28:13.387 --> 28:14.170
- My god!

28:18.087 --> 28:19.175
- Ah!

28:19.219 --> 28:19.959
[groaning]

28:20.002 --> 28:21.395
- What are you doing?

28:21.438 --> 28:23.397
Why are you doing
 this to yourself?

28:24.485 --> 28:25.834
- When the real
 time comes, I may be

28:25.878 --> 28:30.883
shot, wounded, hurt,
 delirious with pain.

28:32.014 --> 28:34.843
I gotta remain focused
 on what I want.

28:55.168 --> 28:56.169
- Detective?

28:58.562 --> 28:59.389
Nash?

29:04.568 --> 29:05.352
Chase?

29:31.291 --> 29:32.118
Shit!

29:34.076 --> 29:36.687
Is this virtual reality or what?

29:38.820 --> 29:39.603
Chase!

29:41.692 --> 29:44.130
[gun blasting]

29:58.971 --> 30:00.668
- How ya doin', Madison?

30:03.105 --> 30:06.239
When the big one shows
 up, I'll be ready for it.

30:06.282 --> 30:07.718
- What big one?

30:07.762 --> 30:09.764
- When it arrives,
 you'll know it.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.288
Matter of fact, we're
 all gonna know it.

30:12.332 --> 30:13.507
Lets go get our score.

30:16.945 --> 30:20.383
I feel like I did five miles.

30:20.427 --> 30:21.820
- This is crazy and insane.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.996
You're reasoning is totally
 warped, Detective Nash.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.345
- Hey look, I never
 said it was the

30:25.388 --> 30:27.086
Good Housekeeping
 stamp of approval.

30:27.129 --> 30:28.696
I got my share of
 knots, all right?

30:28.739 --> 30:32.221
- Yeah, like the hangman's
 noose dangling over your head.

30:32.265 --> 30:33.483
- [Announcer] Winner,
 with a new high score.

30:33.527 --> 30:36.704
300 perfect points,
 Detective Nash.

30:36.747 --> 30:41.491
[crowd applauds]
[crowd cheers]

30:41.535 --> 30:43.537
- All right, I won!

30:43.580 --> 30:45.756
Ah, I feel like Marciano
after the fight.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.933
- Don't look like you
 won to me, retard.

30:47.976 --> 30:50.674
- Ooh, Jesus, hey,
 this guy is tough.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.589
- Oh, yeah.
 - He's meant to be tough.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.853
You know, Nash, if you
 don't watch yourself

30:54.896 --> 30:56.550
we're gonna have to
 take you to the doctor

30:56.593 --> 30:59.770
so he can check your
 brain so that you

30:59.814 --> 31:01.947
don't get any booboos anymore.

31:01.990 --> 31:02.904
[laughing]

31:02.948 --> 31:04.645
- Hey, Kyle, I'm outta bullets.

31:04.688 --> 31:06.386
I can't put you
 outta your misery.

31:06.429 --> 31:07.953
In the meantime, so you
 don't look like a damn fool,

31:07.996 --> 31:09.345
why don't you zipper up your fly

31:09.389 --> 31:11.739
before your wee little
 wee-wee falls out.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.661
Take care of these
 guys, real pissers.

31:20.704 --> 31:21.923
- Little pissers.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.664
- How'd he know
 yours is so little?

31:25.666 --> 31:26.928
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:26.972 --> 31:27.842
You know, maybe
 there's something

31:27.886 --> 31:30.149
to this ESP thing, I don't know.

31:31.367 --> 31:32.934
- Oh, it needs to
 be disinfected.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.849
Put your gun away.

31:34.893 --> 31:35.676
Let's get some peroxide on that.

31:35.719 --> 31:37.547
- I could put you on it.

31:38.722 --> 31:39.419
- You're right out
 of the cookoo's nest.

31:39.462 --> 31:40.724
You know that, Nash?

31:40.768 --> 31:41.551
- I know.

31:45.816 --> 31:47.731
- Stop messing around.

31:49.211 --> 31:52.736
Okay, bite on a bullet or
 something, this is gonna hurt.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.347
- Let me swallow my gum first.

31:57.785 --> 31:58.917
- That's not gonna help much.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.135
- It's not gonna hurt.

32:02.703 --> 32:03.660
- Jesus!

32:03.704 --> 32:05.662
[blowing]

32:16.238 --> 32:17.109
- What's the matter?

32:17.152 --> 32:18.762
- What are you, a terminator?

32:18.806 --> 32:20.112
Don't you feel pain?

32:21.243 --> 32:22.549
- Sarge, just having
 you next to me

32:22.592 --> 32:24.290
to touch me numbs me in ecstasy.

32:25.465 --> 32:27.032
- Do your own then.

32:30.600 --> 32:34.865
- Hey, Sarge, hold the wheel
 for me for a minute, would ya?

32:36.737 --> 32:38.304
It's here somewhere.

32:39.783 --> 32:40.828
Ah!

32:46.834 --> 32:49.619
- I didn't know undercover
 meant six feet under.

32:49.663 --> 32:50.838
- Don't bury us yet, Sarge.

32:50.881 --> 32:52.405
Me and you got possibility.

32:52.448 --> 32:55.190
- If anyone's gonna bury
 us, Detective Nash, its you!

32:55.234 --> 32:56.757
- Hey, don't you think you
 can call me something a little

32:56.800 --> 32:58.541
sweeter by now,
 we're all buddies?

32:58.585 --> 33:00.152
Call me Chase!

33:00.195 --> 33:01.762
- Driving under the influence is

33:01.805 --> 33:04.721
against the law in
 case you forgot.

33:04.765 --> 33:06.636
- Okay, want me
 to give myself up?

33:06.680 --> 33:09.291
[tires screeching]

33:09.335 --> 33:11.685
- I'd call it police corruption.

33:11.728 --> 33:13.948
- Hey, don't tell me
about police corruption!

33:13.992 --> 33:15.036
I can tell you about
 police corruption

33:15.080 --> 33:17.560
and it's not me, all right?

33:17.604 --> 33:19.258
- Well, what are
 you talking about?

33:20.476 --> 33:23.175
- I'd tell you, but
 I gotta be drunk.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.875
- You're terrible.

33:27.918 --> 33:29.746
- Not bad yourself.

33:29.790 --> 33:31.357
- No, I mean, you're
 really terrible.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.489
- I mean, you're really
not bad yourself.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.063
Why don't you come
 a little closer?

33:42.107 --> 33:43.978
I don't bite, you know.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.719
- Would you keep
 your eye on the road?

33:45.762 --> 33:48.200
Keep your mind on work!

33:48.243 --> 33:50.811
- Damn, I got that itch.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.073
I get it every so often.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.554
It drives me crazy
 like a bad tick.

33:54.597 --> 33:55.468
Oh, man.

33:56.382 --> 33:57.687
Son of a bitch.

33:59.646 --> 34:02.083
- All right, where's
 the damn itch?

34:02.127 --> 34:03.693
- Right here.

34:03.737 --> 34:05.652
No, have to move
around, further.

34:05.695 --> 34:06.957
Come on further
 around, a little bit.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.002
Oh, closer.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.569
There you go.
 [laughs]

34:09.612 --> 34:10.657
Oops, it's gone.

34:10.699 --> 34:11.788
- Ooh!

34:11.831 --> 34:13.355
- I couldn't help myself.

34:13.399 --> 34:15.574
What's the matter, ain't
 you ever been kissed before?

34:15.618 --> 34:18.882
- Look, Detective, let's get
 something straight right now.

34:18.926 --> 34:21.407
This isn't some frivolous
 preppy college fraternity

34:21.449 --> 34:23.409
to see who fucks the chick!

34:23.452 --> 34:25.411
We're here on emergency
police business and we

34:25.454 --> 34:27.804
have a case to crack
and we better do it soon

34:27.848 --> 34:29.023
before half the
 city falls victim

34:29.067 --> 34:31.938
to this monster from
 the black lagoon!

34:31.982 --> 34:33.723
So grow up fast!

34:33.766 --> 34:36.683
- Here, Sarge, you need a
drink after a sermon like that.

34:36.726 --> 34:37.597
- That's it!

34:37.639 --> 34:38.946
Stop the car, pull over!

34:38.989 --> 34:40.382
- Hey, hey, take it
easy, I'm on the wagon.

34:40.426 --> 34:41.643
No more beer, all right?

34:41.688 --> 34:43.297
Here look, no more,
 finished, okay?

34:43.342 --> 34:44.212
That's it.

34:44.255 --> 34:45.170
I'll start drinking soda.

34:48.737 --> 34:49.609
Some wine, maybe?

34:50.827 --> 34:52.873
Only kidding, all
right, no more drinking.

34:57.530 --> 34:58.531
- Watch out!

35:01.621 --> 35:03.057
God, your crazy!

35:03.884 --> 35:04.972
Stop this car right now.

35:05.015 --> 35:06.278
You hear me, Detective Nash.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.322
I'll have you up for
 immediate suspension.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.237
Not to mention
 sexual harassment.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.544
- I don't think he liked
that you missed him.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.067
He's coming back for some more.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.025
- What?

35:16.114 --> 35:16.897
- Take a look.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.425
- Jesus, you bring bad luck!

35:23.469 --> 35:24.252
- Scared?

35:25.862 --> 35:28.343
- No, I'm not scared, I'm a
trained professional, remember?

35:28.387 --> 35:30.911
[gun firing]

35:33.392 --> 35:35.220
- That son of a bitch,
 he blew my balls!

35:35.263 --> 35:36.873
- I don't believe this!

35:36.917 --> 35:39.963
- Welcome to Chase's
 Believe It or Not!

35:40.007 --> 35:42.227
[gun firing]

35:44.838 --> 35:46.927
Wow, you really pissed him off.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.537
Probably some psychoneurotic
 who decided to kill himself

35:48.581 --> 35:51.540
tonight by a head-on collision,
but you ruined his plan.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.716
- Would you shut up,
 you're ruining my aim!

35:53.760 --> 35:54.630
- How about your life?

35:54.674 --> 35:55.675
- That, too.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.245
- You have any powder in
those bullets or what?

36:00.288 --> 36:02.986
- Nine millimeter
 rounds are deadly.

36:03.030 --> 36:05.293
[gun firing]

36:06.773 --> 36:07.643
- Son of a bitch.

36:07.687 --> 36:09.558
Sarge, put your seatbelt on.

36:09.602 --> 36:10.951
- Give me a break.

36:23.964 --> 36:26.488
- Good shooting, did
 you hit him once?

36:26.532 --> 36:28.969
- Haven't missed
 once, Mr. Fabulous.

36:29.012 --> 36:31.014
- Yeah, how come
 he's still coming?

36:34.148 --> 36:36.019
- I'm calling for help.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.328
It's dead.

36:40.372 --> 36:42.156
- I didn't connect it yet.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.636
- What?

36:43.679 --> 36:44.811
- When it's all over, we'll stop

36:44.854 --> 36:46.769
at a phone booth and call it in.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.075
Right now, hold on.

36:48.118 --> 36:49.250
I wanna take a good look
at him shootin' at us.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.078
Hold on.

36:51.121 --> 36:53.559
[tires screeching]

36:53.602 --> 36:54.603
- What are you doing?

36:54.647 --> 36:56.039
- You made me miss him before.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.346
This time he's not
 gonna be so lucky.

36:58.390 --> 36:59.956
- [Madison] You're one sick pup.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.044
- Yeah, I got my moments.

37:05.092 --> 37:08.574
- You're gonna kill us!

37:08.617 --> 37:09.401
Watch out!

37:11.141 --> 37:14.057
[tires screeching]

37:15.494 --> 37:17.191
- Come on, buddy-boo.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.762
[gun firing]

37:22.805 --> 37:25.460
- What, does he
 got, a cat burne?

37:28.942 --> 37:30.117
Hey, you lucky son of a bitch!

37:30.160 --> 37:32.467
Who's shooting the
 pickles now, huh?

37:34.339 --> 37:35.557
You see me hit his lights?

37:35.601 --> 37:36.863
- Yeah.
 - I hit his lights, right?

37:36.906 --> 37:38.168
- Yeah.

37:38.212 --> 37:38.734
- Well, how come
 they didn't blow?

37:38.778 --> 37:39.866
- I don't know.

37:39.909 --> 37:40.954
- See how the bum like this.

37:40.997 --> 37:42.042
Tires!

37:46.568 --> 37:48.135
- Must be Goodyear.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.441
- The whole car's bulletproof.

37:49.484 --> 37:51.486
- It's almost like
 he's bulletproof.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.096
- Maybe he's returned
 from the dead.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.750
- Yeah, well, let's
 send him back!

37:56.317 --> 37:59.538
Hey look, you suicidal bastard,
whoever the hell you are!

37:59.581 --> 38:01.453
Don't worry about your
 plans being ruined

38:01.496 --> 38:03.019
because I'm gonna kill ya!

38:03.063 --> 38:04.325
Just yell out
 before it's all over

38:04.369 --> 38:06.458
what kinda flowers you
 want at your funeral!

38:14.422 --> 38:15.554
- What are you doing?

38:15.597 --> 38:18.383
[laughs]

38:18.426 --> 38:19.819
It's over, Nash!

38:19.862 --> 38:21.342
- Night's just beginning, Maddy!

38:22.865 --> 38:25.172
- You are one crazy bastard!

38:25.215 --> 38:26.260
- It's fun being me.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.446
- What kind of gasoline
are we burning?

38:38.490 --> 38:40.100
- NASA rocket fuel.

38:41.493 --> 38:42.494
- Slow down!

38:45.671 --> 38:47.368
- Nothing like living
 dangerously, Maddy.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.196
Makes you enjoy the
 walks in the park.

38:49.239 --> 38:50.458
- Yeah, right!

38:50.502 --> 38:52.982
Like playing dead
 at Forest Lawn.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.942
What are you doing?

38:55.985 --> 38:57.944
You're pushing your
 already bad luck!

38:57.987 --> 38:59.206
- Scared yet?

38:59.249 --> 39:00.686
- No, only the
 unknown scares me.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.383
I knew your number
 a long time ago.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.390
[scratching]

39:09.434 --> 39:10.260
Oh shit!

39:17.833 --> 39:19.095
- Oh, so you do have a vice?

39:19.139 --> 39:21.707
- Driven to smoke
 by a crazy like you!

39:23.796 --> 39:26.755
Oh my god, this is too much.

39:26.799 --> 39:28.714
- Little itsy bitsy scared yet?

39:28.757 --> 39:30.759
[sighs]

39:32.587 --> 39:34.937
How do you like the view?
 - I don't, this is suicide.

39:34.981 --> 39:37.113
I can't see a damn thing.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.333
- I can see you, but
 you don't look so bad.

39:40.856 --> 39:43.163
Hey, Maddie, you sure you
 can't see a damn thing?

39:43.206 --> 39:45.426
- Not a damn thing!

39:45.470 --> 39:47.123
- Good, I'll drink to that.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.342
- Look out!

39:49.430 --> 39:52.041
- Man, I'm not gonna spill it.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.630
- This can't be happening,
 this is only a bad dream.

40:15.674 --> 40:16.892
You will awake.

40:16.936 --> 40:19.547
Detective Chase will
only be a fading memory.

40:19.591 --> 40:20.809
[bats screeching]

40:20.853 --> 40:23.072
[screams]

40:24.291 --> 40:25.640
Creepy little shits.

40:25.684 --> 40:28.208
[gun firing]

40:29.252 --> 40:31.298
- No, we're gonna close up!

40:33.648 --> 40:34.910
- Huh?

40:34.954 --> 40:35.955
- Nevermind.

40:37.870 --> 40:38.610
- Oh shit!

40:42.701 --> 40:45.921
Chase, get the fuck
 outta here now!

40:45.965 --> 40:47.706
- You called me Chase.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.843
[rocks falling]

41:08.161 --> 41:10.380
[screams]

41:22.784 --> 41:24.786
Damn, that's twice
 they got away from me.

41:24.830 --> 41:27.833
- You are by far the most
 pompous, inconsiderate

41:27.876 --> 41:29.965
law enforcer I have
ever had the misfortune

41:30.009 --> 41:31.532
of almost dying with!

41:31.576 --> 41:33.534
- Is that right, Miss
 Complaint Department?

41:33.578 --> 41:36.145
If I'm ever gonna have
 to die with somebody,

41:36.189 --> 41:38.408
it's definitely not
 gonna be you, okay?

41:38.452 --> 41:40.149
- Yeah, well don't
 do me ny favors.

41:40.193 --> 41:41.586
- I won't.

41:41.629 --> 41:43.326
I haven't seen you perform
 any great wonders yet.

41:43.370 --> 41:44.806
- When you do, you'll know it.

41:44.850 --> 41:46.199
- Yeah, I'll know it.

41:46.242 --> 41:47.983
You're gonna save
 the world, right?

41:48.027 --> 41:49.985
Jesus, all this
nagging, I need a drink.

41:51.596 --> 41:52.379
- Make that two.

41:53.772 --> 41:55.208
- What do you drink?

41:55.251 --> 41:57.471
- Tequila, straight up, 1800.

41:59.342 --> 42:01.736
[rock music]

42:07.829 --> 42:11.224
So, you have the car rigged
 on remote or somethin'?

42:11.267 --> 42:14.749
- No, just instinct.

42:14.793 --> 42:17.273
- Instinct don't steer a car
 through a pitch black tunnel

42:17.317 --> 42:19.972
when you're not looking
 and you can't see diddly.

42:20.015 --> 42:22.061
- Especially if my
 instinct is busy doing

42:22.104 --> 42:25.760
something else like steering
 my hormones right your way.

42:25.804 --> 42:26.718
- Excuse me?

42:29.111 --> 42:32.506
- I'm psychic, okay ESP?

42:32.550 --> 42:34.552
Do do do do, do do do do.

42:35.727 --> 42:38.294
Sarge, I can see with my
eyes opened or closed.

42:38.338 --> 42:40.122
It don't matter, far or near.

42:40.166 --> 42:42.081
Except my mind has
 eyes on the outside.

42:44.300 --> 42:45.824
- Now, you're scaring me.

42:45.867 --> 42:47.260
- Good, your facade
 is weakening.

42:47.303 --> 42:48.304
Welcome to the club.

42:50.306 --> 42:52.134
- So why you so bash angry?

42:53.396 --> 42:55.398
- Read the accident reports.

42:55.442 --> 42:57.052
I'm a living freak.

42:57.096 --> 42:59.141
Without warning I can go
 into a psychedelic frenzy,

42:59.185 --> 43:01.404
peer into distant future events.

43:01.448 --> 43:03.102
Different dimensions,
 for crying out loud!

43:03.145 --> 43:04.103
I didn't ask for this!

43:04.146 --> 43:05.321
It was the accident.

43:07.106 --> 43:08.716
You wanna see something, Sarge?

43:10.544 --> 43:13.199
Gunshot wood from the
 Cotton-Lansky case.

43:14.809 --> 43:17.116
I was in a coma for two weeks.

43:17.159 --> 43:19.379
Corpus delicti was I
 became a guinea pig,

43:19.422 --> 43:21.511
a marvel, a wonder,
the sous-saint prodigy.

43:21.555 --> 43:23.905
Phenomenon of nature,
 volcanic eruption.

43:23.949 --> 43:25.820
They called me every
 name in the book.

43:25.864 --> 43:27.561
Because of this.

43:28.518 --> 43:29.607
- My god.

43:31.391 --> 43:33.698
I've heard of these things,
 but I never met a real--

43:33.741 --> 43:35.090
- Crazy?

43:35.134 --> 43:35.961
- Before.

43:38.703 --> 43:40.008
- You know, it's funny, Sarge.

43:40.052 --> 43:42.097
Years ago, we'd smoke
 reefers just beckoning

43:42.141 --> 43:44.839
to find the altered
 consciousness.

43:44.883 --> 43:46.188
Right now, if I had a choice,

43:46.232 --> 43:48.713
I wouldn't touch it
 with a 10-foot pole.

43:48.756 --> 43:50.497
- [Madison] So
 that's why you drink?

43:51.977 --> 43:53.413
- You got it, it numbs me.

43:53.456 --> 43:55.676
I'm on manic overdrive
 most of the time.

43:55.720 --> 43:58.592
It's another reason why
I'm great at what I do.

44:00.420 --> 44:01.334
- Shit.

44:01.377 --> 44:03.423
Talk about a good line of gab.

44:03.466 --> 44:05.947
We've been shot at,
 pursued mystery perps

44:05.991 --> 44:08.167
through dark, abandoned tunnels,

44:08.210 --> 44:11.649
almost killed by an avalanche
 and all in the name of ESP.

44:11.692 --> 44:13.520
Well, tell me Mr. Psychic Cop,

44:13.563 --> 44:15.696
what's your sous saint
 oracle of the mind

44:15.740 --> 44:17.611
saying about what happens next?

44:19.700 --> 44:23.051
- If I'm hearing correctly,
something about partners in bed.

44:26.402 --> 44:29.405
- Wishful thinking,
 tall, dark, and handsome.

44:29.449 --> 44:32.408
Bet you'll be quick to
 leave like all run arounds.

44:32.452 --> 44:33.627
I also have foresight.

44:39.198 --> 44:40.416
- She has foresight,
 I have hindsight

44:40.460 --> 44:42.636
and it doesn't look
 too bad from here.

44:44.943 --> 44:47.728
[soft rock music]

45:24.286 --> 45:27.072
Sarge, I know you've been hurt.

45:28.682 --> 45:29.727
I've been hurt, too.

45:31.903 --> 45:33.165
I'm not the bad guy.

45:35.863 --> 45:38.561
You don't have to if
 you don't want to.

45:38.605 --> 45:40.520
You probably won't until you do.

45:42.609 --> 45:44.089
But you can trust me.

45:46.482 --> 45:50.791
Maybe if you give it some
 time, we can help each other.

46:24.956 --> 46:27.654
You looking for somebody, honey?

46:27.697 --> 46:29.699
- I certainly am.

46:29.743 --> 46:32.702
And it is definitely not you.

46:34.356 --> 46:35.836
- Well, what about you?

46:35.880 --> 46:37.490
- You know what they say
 about cops with big guns?

46:37.533 --> 46:40.449
They have small--
 - Nevermind.

46:40.493 --> 46:42.495
- Looks like it's
 not your lucky night.

46:42.538 --> 46:45.106
- It's not my lucky life.

46:45.150 --> 46:47.848
- Who you calling, the
 lonely lovers hotline?

46:47.892 --> 46:48.718
- Funny.

46:50.198 --> 46:51.765
I'm calling in the plates
 on the mystery mobile.

46:51.809 --> 46:55.029
You never know, it might be
connected to the stripper case.

46:55.073 --> 46:57.118
- How'd you see the plates?

46:57.162 --> 46:58.903
- Fore--
 - Foresight, I know.

47:03.037 --> 47:05.170
[gun firing]

47:05.213 --> 47:07.433
[moaning]

47:09.609 --> 47:11.002
- No, not again!

47:14.396 --> 47:17.269
[tires screeching]

47:19.227 --> 47:21.882
[sirens blaring]

47:28.236 --> 47:31.544
- Approximately 35 year old
male, gunshot wound to the head.

47:31.587 --> 47:32.893
- Come on, Chase, hold on.

47:32.937 --> 47:34.721
You're bigger and
 better than that.

47:36.157 --> 47:37.898
Is he gonna make it?
 - Some do, some don't.

47:37.942 --> 47:39.204
90 over 80.

47:39.247 --> 47:41.075
- He isn't some don't,
 he's gonna make it.

47:41.119 --> 47:45.384
- Promise me you'll balance
 the shift to make it equal.

47:45.427 --> 47:47.777
- What did he say?
 - Oh, he's just delirious.

47:52.957 --> 47:54.480
- To hire places.

47:54.523 --> 47:58.571
- [Woman Spirit] You're
 not allowed to go up there.

47:58.614 --> 48:01.704
- [Male Spirit] You're
 not betraying us.

48:02.836 --> 48:05.447
- [EMT] He's going into shock.

48:06.492 --> 48:07.275
- Chase.

48:08.755 --> 48:09.799
Hold on.

48:13.847 --> 48:15.457
- Current status?

48:15.501 --> 48:18.025
- They've already penetrated
 the dimension of redemption?

48:18.069 --> 48:19.722
- The level of angels?

48:19.766 --> 48:22.029
- Yes, but will they be able
 to pass through the lights?

48:22.073 --> 48:23.683
- Not known yet.

48:23.726 --> 48:25.903
- But it is the absence of
 light that creates evil.

48:25.946 --> 48:28.993
Once illuminated by the
 highest wisdom's illumination,

48:29.036 --> 48:30.820
it must be destroyed.

48:30.864 --> 48:33.693
- Yes, but when forces of
 evil gain power and form,

48:33.736 --> 48:35.347
the force of good is weakened,

48:35.390 --> 48:37.305
and thus in turn
 weakens the light.

48:37.349 --> 48:38.959
- Then what of
 unspeakable highest judge

48:39.003 --> 48:40.700
of all, the creator?

48:40.743 --> 48:42.963
Will he allow himself
 to be destroyed?

48:43.007 --> 48:44.704
- He will not go
 back on his own law.

48:44.747 --> 48:47.707
Free will to Man will
 not be intervened.

48:47.750 --> 48:49.796
- The creator has
 intervened before.

48:49.839 --> 48:51.363
- As decreed during that period.

48:51.406 --> 48:54.888
If Man's pull to evil would
 greatly outweigh his pull

48:54.932 --> 48:56.585
to good, then it
 would be left to Man

48:56.629 --> 48:58.631
to witness his own demise.

48:58.674 --> 49:00.372
- Even if it means
 destruction to all,

49:00.415 --> 49:01.721
including the unspeakable?

49:01.764 --> 49:03.984
- If the almighty allows this.

49:04.028 --> 49:05.725
- Was it really a suicide?

49:05.768 --> 49:06.552
- And up.

49:07.857 --> 49:09.598
- Okay, come on, hold
him, he's hemorrhaging.

49:09.642 --> 49:11.513
- Administer another five
 cc's of sodium pentathol.

49:11.557 --> 49:12.819
- Right, doctor.

49:12.862 --> 49:15.996
- All right, let's see
 what we've got here.

49:16.040 --> 49:17.650
- Ah, Christ, he's a gusher.

49:17.693 --> 49:19.608
- The EEGs all over the place.

49:19.652 --> 49:21.654
- The bullet must be
 touching the corpus callosum.

49:21.697 --> 49:23.656
- And he's hallucinating
while unconscious.

49:23.699 --> 49:25.223
That's a tidbit
 for the journals.

49:25.266 --> 49:26.572
- I'll say.

49:26.615 --> 49:28.008
- [Nurse] Heart rate
 is dropping, Doctor.

49:28.052 --> 49:28.922
- [Nurse] We are not
 stopping the hemorrhaging.

49:28.966 --> 49:30.402
- This is unbelievable.
- 45.

49:30.445 --> 49:31.664
- 33.

49:31.707 --> 49:32.970
- 40.
 - I don't know what to do.

49:33.013 --> 49:34.275
- [Woman] 35.

49:34.319 --> 49:35.102
- [Man] He's getting
 close to brain dead.

49:35.146 --> 49:36.451
- [Woman] 30.

49:36.495 --> 49:38.018
- We gotta stop the bleeding.

49:38.062 --> 49:40.455
If it's right next to the corpus
callosum, you can't go in.

49:40.499 --> 49:42.414
- What you're saying is
if we cut him he dies,

49:42.457 --> 49:43.893
if we don't cut him, he dies?

49:43.937 --> 49:45.547
- We're losing him, doctor.

49:45.591 --> 49:46.679
- 35, we're losing him, doctor.

49:46.722 --> 49:51.727
- Let's have a decision.
[beeping]

49:53.555 --> 49:55.253
- [Doctor] Get the saw
 ready, we're going in.

49:55.296 --> 49:57.168
Give me a number three scalpel.

49:57.211 --> 50:01.215
- Stop, change of plans.

50:02.477 --> 50:05.089
Freeze him, freeze
 him to near death.

50:07.352 --> 50:09.049
Welcome back, Chase.

50:09.093 --> 50:11.182
More exciting the
second time around, huh?

50:18.624 --> 50:22.976
Well, uh, he has a hard
 head so the bullet didn't go

50:23.020 --> 50:25.631
too deep, or it would
 have been instant.

50:25.674 --> 50:28.721
The downside is that
the entry is right next

50:28.764 --> 50:31.071
to the previous wound,
 compounding the damage

50:31.115 --> 50:33.334
by creating an instant aneurysm,

50:33.378 --> 50:36.642
which is a blood vessel
that has ballooned

50:36.685 --> 50:38.774
in this case to the
 size of a golf ball.

50:38.818 --> 50:42.082
With normal blood
 pressure, operating is like

50:42.126 --> 50:43.823
operating on a balloon.

50:43.866 --> 50:46.913
If it bursts, the
 patient's lost.

50:46.956 --> 50:51.918
So we're trying a very new
 and somewhat risky procedure

50:53.137 --> 50:55.095
whereby his body and
 brain are frozen,

50:55.139 --> 50:57.315
allowing us sufficient
 time and control

50:57.358 --> 50:59.491
for surgery before brain death.

51:02.015 --> 51:05.584
At this point, I can only
 suggest that you pray.

51:09.979 --> 51:10.980
I'm sorry.

51:13.026 --> 51:13.809
- Thanks.

51:21.687 --> 51:24.081
- There it is, this
 is the last of it.

51:24.124 --> 51:27.997
A 'Vette, '72 white Corvette.

51:28.955 --> 51:32.611
Anthony Maroni, age 72,
resides at Gail Park,

51:32.654 --> 51:34.526
516 Perkins Street.

51:34.569 --> 51:36.354
Nothing else even fits the bill.

51:36.397 --> 51:37.355
- Think back, Chester.

51:37.398 --> 51:39.139
Did he say anything else?

51:39.183 --> 51:40.009
- Nothing.

51:41.315 --> 51:43.622
Poor guy, this was his
second time around, huh?

51:43.665 --> 51:46.233
[phone ringing]

51:46.277 --> 51:47.060
- Yeah.

51:50.063 --> 51:51.717
[sighs]
 All right, thanks.

51:53.719 --> 51:56.504
- Sorry, wish I coulda
 had better news.

51:56.548 --> 51:57.897
What a bummer.

51:57.940 --> 51:59.377
I'm gonna be haunted
 by those last words,

51:59.420 --> 52:01.292
I owe you for a long time.

52:01.335 --> 52:04.077
[dramatic music]

52:06.123 --> 52:06.993
- What?

52:07.036 --> 52:08.603
- Nothing.

52:08.647 --> 52:11.040
Just before he got shot,
he said he owes me.

52:12.041 --> 52:15.132
You know, for a hot shot
cop he was an okay guy.

52:15.175 --> 52:17.873
- I owe you, you said
there was nothing else.

52:17.917 --> 52:21.181
I owe you, A VET IOU.

52:21.225 --> 52:24.010
[typing]

52:24.053 --> 52:27.796
[computer beeping]

52:27.840 --> 52:28.710
- There it is.

52:28.754 --> 52:32.149
A, American, VET, veteran, IOU.

52:32.192 --> 52:33.541
Shit!

52:33.585 --> 52:35.935
He's a post-Nam freak
 groping for revenge.

52:35.978 --> 52:37.676
Son of a bitch, thanks!

52:42.246 --> 52:45.814
- Sorry, Chase, you
 don't owe me nothing.

52:47.468 --> 52:48.904
I owe you, man.

52:48.948 --> 52:51.864
[sirens blaring]

53:01.090 --> 53:02.875
- Hey, Sarge, I need
 your John Hancock.

53:02.918 --> 53:03.745
It's all yours.

53:06.922 --> 53:09.055
- Hey, sweet cop.

53:10.578 --> 53:15.453
- I hear Chase has taken off,
 bedridden in a deep slumber.

53:16.628 --> 53:18.151
- Too bad about
 your partner, Sarge,

53:18.195 --> 53:20.719
but I knew if he didn't slow
 down he'd burst a bubble.

53:21.981 --> 53:25.071
Of course, you're actually
 lucky that Chase is in a coma.

53:25.114 --> 53:26.681
- Lucky, why?

53:26.725 --> 53:29.902
- Because now you're ready
 for some real, live partners.

53:29.945 --> 53:32.861
- You know, let me tell
you somethin', sweetie.

53:32.905 --> 53:36.909
We figured you must be lonely,
 so me and my buddy here,

53:36.952 --> 53:39.346
we're willing to swing
 a little trio action,

53:39.390 --> 53:40.869
you know what I'm saying?
 - Yeah.

53:40.913 --> 53:42.784
- Ooh, the three of us?

53:42.828 --> 53:43.698
- Yeah.

53:43.742 --> 53:45.570
- We're givers, we love to give.

53:45.613 --> 53:47.267
Like these guys,
 what do you think?

53:47.311 --> 53:49.617
That ain't Twister, you
know what I'm saying?

53:50.749 --> 53:52.577
- What makes you
 think I'm interested?

53:54.535 --> 53:58.191
- Look, you got a
 great pair of legs,

53:58.235 --> 53:59.627
but, I mean, how far is
 looks gonna get ya when you

53:59.671 --> 54:01.847
got a six-foot-four
 maniac shooting

54:01.890 --> 54:03.979
buckshot at you point blank?

54:06.155 --> 54:09.115
- Look, what my partner
here is suggesting is

54:09.158 --> 54:10.638
that maybe, you know, you
 could use a little bit

54:10.682 --> 54:14.120
of private lessons.

54:14.163 --> 54:15.252
'Cause there's
 nothing that we don't

54:15.295 --> 54:18.298
know or can't teach you.

54:20.169 --> 54:22.171
- So what you're saying is,

54:22.215 --> 54:25.349
you don't think I
 can handle myself.

54:25.392 --> 54:28.177
- You're a class A piece
 of ass, I'll give you that.

54:29.309 --> 54:31.659
As far as being an
 undercover cop is concerned,

54:33.226 --> 54:36.185
you gotta stick with us
 and you'll be free-falling

54:36.229 --> 54:37.404
with your eyes closed.

54:39.145 --> 54:41.452
[groaning]

54:42.975 --> 54:44.193
- Go fuck yourselves.

54:45.760 --> 54:46.544
Officer.

54:48.154 --> 54:50.069
Chase in a coma is a
 lot more interesting

54:50.112 --> 54:53.290
than the two of you with
 your tongues hanging out.

54:53.333 --> 54:54.682
And you dress terrible.

54:55.901 --> 54:57.032
I'm a little pissed off.

55:00.253 --> 55:01.646
- Hey, you know what?

55:01.689 --> 55:03.082
I think Archie's
 cleaners can get that out

55:03.125 --> 55:04.997
'cause I dripped some
 calzone all the way down my

55:05.040 --> 55:06.694
shirt one time and got--
- Shut up!

55:09.001 --> 55:09.784
Idiot!

55:13.005 --> 55:14.702
She's knows somethin'.

55:14.746 --> 55:17.183
- [Dispatcher] Kuluhan,
what's your pinpointing?

55:17.226 --> 55:21.709
- Proceeding towards perps'
 address, nice neighborhood.

55:21.753 --> 55:23.581
- [Dispatcher] 10-4,
 proceed with caution.

55:23.624 --> 55:25.191
- Bingo.

55:25.234 --> 55:30.152
The suspect's '72 low rider
plates A VET IOU parked outside.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.459
No one seen in vicinity, over.

55:32.503 --> 55:33.373
- [Dispatcher] Roger that.

55:33.417 --> 55:34.679
Requesting backup?

55:34.722 --> 55:36.811
- No, consider it
 under control, over.

55:36.855 --> 55:39.118
- [Dispatcher] 10-4, but
proceed with caution.

55:39.161 --> 55:40.598
Hey, watch your ass
 out there, Kuluhan.

55:40.641 --> 55:43.035
This stripper case has
got us all freaked out.

55:44.341 --> 55:47.256
[dramatic music]

57:00.982 --> 57:05.987
[gun fires]
[cat screeches]

57:42.546 --> 57:44.330
This ain't no skunk.

58:05.569 --> 58:08.223
[wings flapping]

58:21.236 --> 58:22.237
[shouts]

58:22.281 --> 58:25.197
[monster growls]

59:05.977 --> 59:07.587
[groans]

59:07.631 --> 59:08.893
Oh my god!

59:10.982 --> 59:12.549
- Jesus, man, looks like she
 just saw a ghost or something.

59:12.592 --> 59:14.855
- Yeah, bet it wasn't Chase's.

59:14.899 --> 59:17.292
Take and look and see what's
 spooking the bitch, huh?

59:21.340 --> 59:23.560
- Holy shit!

59:23.603 --> 59:25.518
It's another stripper victim.

59:25.562 --> 59:26.954
- Let's get the fuck
 outta here, man.

59:26.998 --> 59:28.216
Voodoo's not my scene.

59:28.260 --> 59:29.261
- Wait a minute, man,
 we can't just run.

59:29.304 --> 59:30.784
We gotta call it in.

59:30.828 --> 59:33.526
- Doesn't look like she is, man.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.484
[tires screeching]
 - You're right, let's go.

59:35.528 --> 59:37.269
Let's go, come on.

59:37.312 --> 59:38.400
[engine failing]
- Fuck.

59:38.444 --> 59:40.185
- You're on empty.

59:40.228 --> 59:41.447
- Son of a bitch, I
told you to full it up!

59:41.490 --> 59:44.232
- I did, I filled
 it up two days ago.

59:44.276 --> 59:45.146
I filled it up.

59:46.017 --> 59:46.800
Shit!

59:58.812 --> 59:59.596
Come back!

01:00:15.176 --> 01:00:16.613
- I'm sorry, Sarge,
 no one's allowed in.

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:18.484
- Oh, come on.

01:00:18.527 --> 01:00:20.617
- Doctor's orders,
 I wish I could.

01:00:49.776 --> 01:00:51.648
- Oh, miss, there's
 no smoking here.

01:00:53.606 --> 01:00:55.695
- I'm a cop for Christ sakes.

01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.741
- You could be the
first lady or a fireman,

01:00:57.784 --> 01:00:59.438
there's still no smoking.

01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:07.925
[monitor beeping]

01:01:12.451 --> 01:01:15.367
[dramatic music]

01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:22.766
- Oh, oh god!

01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:26.900
Oh god!

01:01:26.944 --> 01:01:28.380
I gotta get outta here!

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:29.468
Oh god!

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:31.862
Please, please.

01:01:33.646 --> 01:01:34.429
Oh.

01:01:41.436 --> 01:01:43.003
- I don't know
 what to do, doctor.

01:01:43.047 --> 01:01:44.004
- [Man] I'm not getting a pulse.

01:01:44.048 --> 01:01:45.745
- Put him in restraints.

01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:48.095
Betty, give more Valium
 and get some Haldol ready.

01:01:48.139 --> 01:01:49.444
- [Man] Jesus what the
 hell's wrong with him?

01:01:49.488 --> 01:01:51.533
- I thought it was a
coma, but I don't know.

01:01:51.577 --> 01:01:53.753
He's split into
 alternating consciousness.

01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:55.624
- Look at the
 electroencephalograph.

01:01:55.668 --> 01:01:57.583
His REM is hitting the roof.

01:01:57.626 --> 01:01:59.106
- [Man] Jesus, nobody
 can dream like that.

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:00.629
It's like he's there.

01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:02.849
- Come on, Freud didn't
 describe this phenomenon.

01:02:02.893 --> 01:02:03.937
Maybe it's the equipment.

01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:05.504
- Forget the
equipment, look at him.

01:02:05.547 --> 01:02:08.376
A reinforced entry to
 the corpus callosum,

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.553
coma induced, severe blood loss,

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.557
in and out of suspended
 animation, forCchrist's sake!

01:02:16.515 --> 01:02:18.473
He can walk out of
 here if we let him.

01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:21.607
No, no, this is Chase,

01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:22.826
and what we're dealing
 with here is a branch

01:02:22.869 --> 01:02:26.525
of medicine that's a
little left wing for us,

01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:27.918
parapsychology.

01:02:28.832 --> 01:02:30.703
- Psychic phenomena?

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.749
- [Doctor] That's right.

01:02:36.578 --> 01:02:39.581
[dramatic music]

01:02:39.625 --> 01:02:41.758
[screaming]

01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:50.505
[monitor beeping]

01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:51.811
- I'd never thought
 I'd be relieved

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:54.205
to see a patient fall
 back into a coma.

01:02:54.248 --> 01:02:56.555
- Now, the question is
how to get him back out.

01:02:56.598 --> 01:02:57.861
- Hm.

01:02:57.904 --> 01:02:59.863
I don't think you have
 to worry about that.

01:02:59.906 --> 01:03:03.954
I think the real problem is
what the hell is bothering him?

01:03:05.651 --> 01:03:08.175
- Your actions were
 totally imbecile!

01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:10.743
You went against professional
 procedure followup.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:14.225
Pursue, restrain if
 possible, and inform.

01:03:14.268 --> 01:03:16.793
Officers, Beebe and York, I
 want a full written report

01:03:16.836 --> 01:03:19.665
on my desk by morning
 as to why you didn't

01:03:19.708 --> 01:03:22.102
notify your dispatcher
 after locating not

01:03:22.146 --> 01:03:24.801
only a homicide, but
 a stripper homicide!

01:03:26.977 --> 01:03:28.456
- You know, it was a--

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.937
- After witnessing
 Sergeant Kuluhan take off

01:03:30.981 --> 01:03:33.244
like she just saw the
 Grim Reaper or something,

01:03:33.287 --> 01:03:35.072
we capitulated to the assumption

01:03:35.115 --> 01:03:37.639
that it was better
 to follow suit.

01:03:37.683 --> 01:03:39.424
We didn't think it was
 prudent to do anything

01:03:39.467 --> 01:03:40.686
beyond the call of
 duty at the time.

01:03:40.729 --> 01:03:43.689
- Oh spare me, will
 you please, you two!

01:03:43.732 --> 01:03:45.647
- Did you capitulate
 as to leave your car

01:03:45.691 --> 01:03:47.171
at the scene of the
 crime because you

01:03:47.214 --> 01:03:49.826
felt it better for your
 health to jog back to central?

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:52.437
Another no-no.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.831
You left an on vehicle, property
of the police department,

01:03:54.874 --> 01:03:58.443
at an un-investigated
 homicide site unattended!

01:04:00.706 --> 01:04:03.361
As for you two emulating your
 hero, Sarge Kuluhan here,

01:04:03.404 --> 01:04:04.449
who do you think called it in?

01:04:04.492 --> 01:04:05.754
She did.

01:04:05.798 --> 01:04:06.668
How do you think
 we found your car?

01:04:09.497 --> 01:04:10.411
Go on, get out.

01:04:17.114 --> 01:04:20.552
There's a request for some
 police protection tonight.

01:04:20.595 --> 01:04:21.727
Annual charity ball
 for underprivileged

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:24.643
children is being
 held at Francine's.

01:04:24.686 --> 01:04:25.731
I'll consider it in good faith

01:04:25.774 --> 01:04:27.776
against your errors
 if you attend.

01:04:28.995 --> 01:04:31.302
Or are you afraid
 of the dark, too?

01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:32.520
- No, the dark is good.

01:04:33.739 --> 01:04:34.696
Jack of diamonds.

01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:48.797
- What the hell is
 happening chief?

01:04:50.234 --> 01:04:52.801
The guy that shoots
 Chase becomes the
 next stripper victim?

01:04:52.845 --> 01:04:55.152
- I don't know, an act of god.

01:04:55.195 --> 01:04:59.678
Look, Sergeant, Chase was
 an ace cracker jack cop.

01:05:00.635 --> 01:05:02.420
I'm sorry about the news.

01:05:03.595 --> 01:05:05.031
I thought maybe the two
of you might be able

01:05:05.075 --> 01:05:07.425
to pave some headway into
 this frivolous affair.

01:05:08.774 --> 01:05:11.211
Maybe I was just
 asking for too much.

01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:12.560
- There's something
 really terrible going

01:05:12.604 --> 01:05:15.085
on out there and I think
Chase may have an idea.

01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:17.217
- What the fuck are
 you talkin' about?

01:05:18.784 --> 01:05:22.048
Excuse my profanity, but you're
not exactly a barbie doll.

01:05:22.092 --> 01:05:24.616
You've been around
 so we can talk, okay?

01:05:25.965 --> 01:05:27.706
It'll be an outright
 miracle if Chase

01:05:27.749 --> 01:05:29.099
were to pull out of this one.

01:05:29.142 --> 01:05:30.665
- Well, then you'd
 better party for it

01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:32.319
because there ain't
 nothin' that's gonna fight

01:05:32.363 --> 01:05:35.670
with that shit that's pulling
 out the insides of bodies.

01:05:35.714 --> 01:05:36.976
- I'm assigning
 you to active duty

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.674
on the Cohandro heroin
case starting tomorrow.

01:05:39.718 --> 01:05:40.937
- What?

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.721
Wait a second, you're
 playing two sides.

01:05:42.764 --> 01:05:45.202
What's goin' down,
Chief, you sellin' out?

01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:46.768
- Sergeant, there's some
super powered docs going

01:05:46.812 --> 01:05:49.206
on here that defies explanation.

01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:50.772
Look at this.

01:05:50.816 --> 01:05:53.862
Reports coming in
 from different cities.

01:05:53.906 --> 01:05:54.776
New York.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:57.257
Seattle, Kansas, it's spreading.

01:05:57.301 --> 01:06:00.217
The same goddamn
 thing is happening.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.349
Even Interpol is
 standing by and nobody

01:06:02.393 --> 01:06:03.960
knows what the
 hell is happening.

01:06:05.439 --> 01:06:08.399
Our own morgue is being
 filled with paper-thin bodies.

01:06:08.442 --> 01:06:09.791
Some jerk down at
 personnel made a joke

01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:12.620
about just stacking 'em
up like pieces of paper.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:18.017
But, by the same token, and
 this is the most ironic thing

01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:23.022
of all, this holocaust is
cleaning out all the evil scum.

01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:27.113
Every victim has been an
 unscrupulous wicked criminal.

01:06:28.332 --> 01:06:32.684
You call it what you
want, the wrath of God,

01:06:32.727 --> 01:06:34.294
divine atonement.

01:06:34.338 --> 01:06:37.254
All I know is it's making my
 job a hell of a lot easier.

01:06:39.778 --> 01:06:40.997
- You sure it's
obedience is gonna stay

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.346
on the side of law and order?

01:06:42.389 --> 01:06:43.912
- What guarantees do
 we have of anything

01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:46.654
in this day and age except
 life and death, Sergeant?

01:06:46.698 --> 01:06:49.788
- Chief, you're saying it
 but you don't believe it.

01:06:49.831 --> 01:06:51.920
- [Chief] What are
 you a mind reader?

01:06:52.921 --> 01:06:54.619
- I spent some time
 with Detective Nash,

01:06:54.662 --> 01:06:56.142
maybe some of it's rubbed off.

01:06:57.839 --> 01:06:58.753
- What do you know?

01:06:59.798 --> 01:07:00.799
- Enough.

01:07:02.975 --> 01:07:03.802
- That's too bad.

01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:10.417
Chase was the piece
 de resistance.

01:07:10.461 --> 01:07:13.507
- What happened to Chase
 back then with the accident?

01:07:13.551 --> 01:07:15.814
- He always was gnostic
about his hunches,

01:07:15.857 --> 01:07:17.250
even before the accident.

01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:20.036
It came down to him
 being the guinea pig

01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:22.038
because nobody else
 believed in the setup.

01:07:23.517 --> 01:07:25.084
He went in alone and
 busted wide open an

01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:29.567
impenetrable drug hierarchy all
hidden in puff cotton balls.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:32.787
He got hit, you know the rest.

01:07:33.701 --> 01:07:36.922
- Chief, he's got a power.

01:07:36.965 --> 01:07:38.967
He could see without eyes.

01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:40.491
He's got a strange
 depth of field.

01:07:40.534 --> 01:07:42.406
He can see very far and
he can see very close,

01:07:42.449 --> 01:07:44.843
and he can see both
 at the same time.

01:07:44.886 --> 01:07:46.366
He sees things from a
 different perspective.

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:48.673
I drove with him as he
 maneuvered through pitch black

01:07:48.716 --> 01:07:51.415
tunnels better than if he
 was in Florida sunshine.

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:52.242
- I know.

01:07:53.852 --> 01:07:56.898
He can do more than
 that, if he lives.

01:07:58.987 --> 01:08:02.774
- Well, if the psychic guy
 is listening or watching,

01:08:02.817 --> 01:08:05.385
he must know that we need him.

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:08.867
Come back, Chase.

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:11.957
[monitor beeping]

01:08:16.221 --> 01:08:19.006
[bell ringing]

01:08:20.225 --> 01:08:23.751
- Oh, I'm sea sick, I
 think I'm gonna throw up!

01:08:23.795 --> 01:08:25.926
- Hang on, I got some
 medicine in your case.

01:08:27.886 --> 01:08:29.582
[whistling]

01:08:29.627 --> 01:08:33.718
- Da da da da da.
 [whistling]

01:08:33.761 --> 01:08:36.982
- Thank you, thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:08:37.024 --> 01:08:41.377
warm, generous, prestigious
friends for being here tonight.

01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:42.205
[children chattering]
 How we doin', all right, yeah?

01:08:45.077 --> 01:08:46.165
- [Dana] I gotta tell
 you, no amount of money is

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:48.124
gonna save some of these kids.

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:49.821
- All of the proceeds from
 tonight's dinner are going

01:08:49.863 --> 01:08:52.953
to go directly to
 the children's bank.

01:08:52.997 --> 01:08:55.696
Any additional donations
or provisions will

01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:58.264
be accepted by our
 chancellor of finance!

01:08:58.308 --> 01:09:01.615
[crowd cheers]
[crowd applauds]

01:09:01.658 --> 01:09:03.835
- I just wanted to tell
 you, you're doing a great.

01:09:03.877 --> 01:09:06.663
In fact, you know, you
 look just like Jerry Lewis.

01:09:06.707 --> 01:09:08.492
- Thank you, thank you.

01:09:08.535 --> 01:09:11.843
- Okay, we have with us
 tonight the world's hottest.

01:09:11.886 --> 01:09:15.368
Hi, that's great,
 thanks, all right.

01:09:15.412 --> 01:09:20.417
Right, the super fantastic,
League of Nations, male snails!

01:09:22.201 --> 01:09:25.203
- Woo, here we go, just
 home, ladies and gentlemen!

01:09:25.247 --> 01:09:26.336
Give to the kids!

01:09:26.379 --> 01:09:29.991
[children chattering]

01:09:30.035 --> 01:09:33.865
- Oh, Henry was a
 snail driving, man!

01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:36.171
A snail driving man!

01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:37.825
- What do you say we come
 out of our shells and

01:09:37.868 --> 01:09:38.957
protect the female guests, huh?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.437
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:43.439
Hey, uh, you protect the
blonde, I'll protect the bruney.

01:09:43.483 --> 01:09:44.962
- Gotcha!
 - Whoo!

01:09:46.051 --> 01:09:47.487
- Hey.

01:09:47.531 --> 01:09:49.314
- Take that, won't ya.
 - We're on break, thanks.

01:09:52.926 --> 01:09:53.971
- Hi, sweetheart, how ya doin'?

01:09:54.015 --> 01:09:54.799
- Hi.

01:09:56.931 --> 01:09:59.630
- Hey, little guy,
 how's it goin'?

01:09:59.673 --> 01:10:01.240
- Terrible, I wanna go.

01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:03.373
- Did you just get transferred?

01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:04.678
- Yeah.

01:10:04.722 --> 01:10:06.419
- Pretty lonely, huh?

01:10:06.463 --> 01:10:07.986
- I'm always lonely.

01:10:08.987 --> 01:10:11.859
I wish I was dead so I
 could be with my Mom.

01:10:16.081 --> 01:10:17.996
- Hey, come on, I bought black.

01:10:18.039 --> 01:10:19.824
- Give it to me.
- It's mine.

01:10:19.867 --> 01:10:22.261
- Hold on, dudes.

01:10:22.305 --> 01:10:26.265
Confucius say you got to share,

01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:29.050
be totally yin and yang, man.

01:10:29.094 --> 01:10:32.140
- Where we come from, yin
 and yang eat the fire.

01:10:32.184 --> 01:10:35.056
- You like red
 hot chili peppers?

01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:38.538
[laughs]

01:10:38.582 --> 01:10:39.452
Burn, burn!

01:10:42.194 --> 01:10:45.153
[audience applauds]

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:57.035
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

01:11:02.736 --> 01:11:04.825
[crying]

01:11:08.394 --> 01:11:09.526
- Come here, what's the matter?

01:11:09.569 --> 01:11:11.179
Why are you crying?

01:11:11.223 --> 01:11:13.312
Not enjoying the party?

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:14.748
- Ah, geez, spoiled brat.

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:17.316
All he wants is a little
shoulder to cry on.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.187
It's a bid for attention,
 that's all it is.

01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:20.711
- The kids scared to death!

01:11:20.754 --> 01:11:23.757
- What do you think,
he saw a ghost or what?

01:11:23.801 --> 01:11:27.152
- You know what they say about
 kid's intuitions, don't you?

01:11:27.195 --> 01:11:29.937
- No.

01:11:29.981 --> 01:11:32.636
[monitor beeping]

01:11:32.679 --> 01:11:35.334
[dramatic music]

[devilish laughing]

01:11:45.257 --> 01:11:49.043
- [Devil] Cut their
reins, make them suffer.

01:11:56.703 --> 01:11:58.662
[devilish laughing]

01:11:58.705 --> 01:11:59.663
Yes, suffer!

01:12:03.884 --> 01:12:04.668
Suffer!

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.370
[screaming]

01:12:11.414 --> 01:12:13.154
- Oh my god!

01:12:13.198 --> 01:12:16.070
[people screaming]

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:20.945
- Geez, let's get outta here.
 - Police, police!

01:12:20.988 --> 01:12:23.077
- [Man] Gotta get
 outta here, man!

01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:28.256
- [Female Spirit] Is
 there anything to be done?

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:30.955
- It would have to be a human
 and not an ordinary human.

01:12:30.998 --> 01:12:32.435
- Most curious.

01:12:32.478 --> 01:12:34.437
- It has been through antiquity
with the higher forces.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.222
Any man who tried it had died.

01:12:37.265 --> 01:12:39.050
It is reversed.

01:12:39.093 --> 01:12:42.227
[monitor flatlining]

01:12:46.884 --> 01:12:51.323
- Oh my god.

01:13:00.158 --> 01:13:01.115
- Jesus.

01:13:01.159 --> 01:13:03.117
- He won't make it five minutes.

01:13:14.651 --> 01:13:17.349
[sirens blaring]

01:13:19.177 --> 01:13:20.047
- [Radio Announcer] The
mystery deaths accounted

01:13:20.091 --> 01:13:21.571
to the psycho stripper case are

01:13:21.614 --> 01:13:23.834
surging cataclysmically upward.

01:13:23.877 --> 01:13:26.706
Nine children, wards of the
 state, were slain last night

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:30.101
by the supernatural death
during a charity at Francine's.

01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:32.320
No bodies were found.

01:13:32.364 --> 01:13:34.148
The question everyone
 is asking, but afraid

01:13:34.192 --> 01:13:37.630
to find out is where will
 this horror strike next?

01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:50.382

01:13:52.297 --> 01:13:54.342

in the Trust of Los Angeles.

Perps are laying dead in the
 middle of a large coal field.

01:21:25.968 --> 01:21:29.362
Their bodies need to be driven
 back like just the strippers.

It rises from the depths of
 the bottomless pit of hell!

01:21:53.473 --> 01:21:55.475
And then it sucks out your soul.

01:21:56.650 --> 01:21:57.782
It's gonna destroy everything.

Hey, Beau, Beau, come here, man.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.901
Take the girl, take
 her back to central.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.208
Hey, we gotta do something

01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:33.731
Very quick.

- Stop yelling profanities,
 it'll get you first.

01:22:35.646 --> 01:22:37.778
Then it'll get me cause
it thinks I'm with you.

01:22:37.822 --> 01:22:40.564
No, we're fucked.
 - We're outta here!

01:22:40.607 --> 01:22:41.521

I know you were my friend.

01:23:10.942 --> 01:23:12.030
- I thought it was
 against the rules

01:23:12.074 --> 01:23:13.466
to drink while on duty.

01:23:17.427 --> 01:23:19.385
- Who's gonna report me?

01:23:19.429 --> 01:23:22.562
You're not real,
 you're just a ghost.

01:23:22.606 --> 01:23:25.739
- If I were, I might be
 able to fight the monsters.

01:23:29.178 --> 01:23:31.093
We still partners?

01:23:31.136 --> 01:23:32.920

01:23:32.964 --> 01:23:34.139
I thought you were dead!

01:23:34.183 --> 01:23:37.838
I thought you were
 dead laying somewhere!

01:23:37.882 --> 01:23:38.752
- Chase.

01:23:38.796 --> 01:23:40.624
Now, we're getting someplace.

01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:42.887
- I just seen the light
 at the end of the tunnel.

01:23:42.930 --> 01:23:44.628
- Oh, it was probably
 just a bad memory

01:23:44.671 --> 01:23:46.978
from your last ride
 with me, that's all.

[sobbing]

01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:55.117
- You crazy fool.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.511
It's a wonder you're still
 alive, what are you doing?

01:23:58.555 --> 01:23:59.947
It's gonna be more
 of a wonder if I

01:23:59.991 --> 01:24:02.776
make it through the night,
 I don't feel too good.

01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:04.082

01:24:04.126 --> 01:24:06.215
We gotta get you to the
hospital, wait, hold on.

- Don't mention
 hospitals, Sarge.

01:24:07.781 --> 01:24:09.044
I hate hospitals.

01:24:09.087 --> 01:24:10.871
- Wait, wait.

01:24:10.915 --> 01:24:12.656

rigid about sex.

01:24:12.699 --> 01:24:14.310

That's what I said.

He's gonna make love to me
 and then he's gonna die.

01:24:26.539 --> 01:24:28.063
Well, at least I'll
 be your last woman.

01:24:29.977 --> 01:24:32.284

 partners then, huh?

01:24:32.328 --> 01:24:33.111

[moaning]

01:24:53.392 --> 01:24:54.915

01:24:54.959 --> 01:24:57.092
- Oh, whatever you're
 doing is great for my head.

01:24:58.223 --> 01:24:59.964
That's great, come
 on, round two.

01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:07.493
- Do I have to wear
 this blindfold?

01:25:07.537 --> 01:25:09.974
- No, give it to me.

01:25:10.017 --> 01:25:11.149
Give it to me, actually.

01:25:11.193 --> 01:25:12.629
I think I can do better with it.

01:25:12.672 --> 01:25:13.760
Oh, that's much better.

01:25:13.804 --> 01:25:15.022
I can see from behind.

01:25:15.066 --> 01:25:17.068
This is like, I can see

There's three of us.
 - Yeah, yeah?

01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:20.898

01:25:20.941 --> 01:25:22.726
Wait I'm cumming, I'm going.

01:25:22.769 --> 01:25:24.249
- Oh my god!
 - Oh wait, don't go.

01:25:24.293 --> 01:25:25.511
I'm cumming, I'm cumming.

01:25:25.555 --> 01:25:27.687
Hold on, wait, give

01:25:27.731 --> 01:25:29.950

01:25:29.994 --> 01:25:31.952

01:25:46.097 --> 01:25:47.794

[romantic music]

01:26:09.033 --> 01:26:09.947
Hi.

01:26:11.992 --> 01:26:15.866
- I'm sorry I woke
 you, go back to sleep.

01:26:15.909 --> 01:26:19.913
- No, I wanted to wake
 you up to see you anyway.

01:26:21.828 --> 01:26:23.221
- How do you feel?

01:26:23.265 --> 01:26:25.223
- I've been worse.

01:26:25.267 --> 01:26:27.182
Even though I don't
 remember when.

01:26:28.357 --> 01:26:31.011
You know what's so great
about no marriage sex?

01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:33.536
You don't have to owe
 each other anything.

01:26:33.579 --> 01:26:35.102
You do it for the fun of it.

01:26:36.408 --> 01:26:39.063
Anyway, marriage is the worst.
