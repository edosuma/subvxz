WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:05.504
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.106
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.107 --> 00:10.565
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:12.544
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:14.146
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fianc√©,</i>

00:14.147 --> 00:16.707
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.783 --> 00:19.283
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:20.853
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.955
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:24.857
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:26.759
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:28.127
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.128 --> 00:30.029
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:31.764
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.765 --> 00:35.223
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:35.902 --> 00:38.894
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:41.701
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:44.308
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.411 --> 00:46.911
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.313 --> 00:49.581
I don't want this job anymore.

00:49.582 --> 00:50.616
I want out.

00:50.617 --> 00:53.018
You're helping bring
an end to SD-6.

00:53.019 --> 00:55.519
- Not anymore.
- Sydney.

00:56.589 --> 00:58.190
You like hockey?
The Kings?

00:58.191 --> 00:59.591
Yeah, how'd you...

00:59.592 --> 01:01.960
They're playing
the Islanders next week.

01:01.961 --> 01:03.962
We should go.

01:03.963 --> 01:06.365
Sydney, you can't do this.

01:06.366 --> 01:08.333
- This is suicide.
- I don't think it is.

01:08.334 --> 01:10.834
What exactly
is your exit strategy here?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.417 --> 01:26.917
Cole.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.227
Emergency lockdown procedures.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.429
The elevator
is returning to SD-6.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.930
The doors
will automatically open.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.668
What do you want?

01:42.669 --> 01:44.703
There's a certain little
somethin'- somethin'

01:44.704 --> 01:47.673
you got in the SD-6 vault.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.209
Sloane must have activated
the emergency failsafe.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.710
There are 500 pounds of C-4
strategically placed

01:52.712 --> 01:54.746
within the substructure
of this building.

01:54.747 --> 01:57.841
Opening the vault
will trigger that C-4.

01:57.917 --> 02:00.417
You want to scramble
the vault codes.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.257
Dad, what are you doing here?

02:38.258 --> 02:40.025
Just stay there.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.226
No, Dad, don't.

02:41.227 --> 02:44.025
Hold your fire!
I'm coming through!

02:44.097 --> 02:46.597
I'm coming out!

03:02.615 --> 03:05.115
You okay?

03:05.418 --> 03:08.785
Except for my head injury, yeah.

03:12.091 --> 03:14.092
Mr. Cool Customer here

03:14.093 --> 03:15.928
was caught crawling
around the vents.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.429
Sit his butt down.

03:20.099 --> 03:22.659
How long is it gonna
take to open the vault?

03:22.735 --> 03:25.295
The sooner I get started,
the sooner I'll know.

03:29.142 --> 03:32.202
I need, like,
awesome good news, baby.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.713
I know.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.480
Endo, Tchen...

03:35.481 --> 03:38.245
I'll be
in the conversation room.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.968
<i>Follow this map
to the three locations</i>

03:55.969 --> 03:58.961
<i>where the C-4 explosives
are set.</i>

04:01.574 --> 04:04.634
<i>You must deactivate
all three C-4 packages</i>

04:04.744 --> 04:07.372
<i>before the vault door opens.</i>

04:09.415 --> 04:11.915
<i>Good luck.</i>

04:29.269 --> 04:31.769
I think I can get to the PDA
and E-mail Langley.

04:31.871 --> 04:33.171
That's not an option.

04:33.172 --> 04:36.232
I understand the need for
plausible deniability here.

04:36.342 --> 04:39.937
The CIA cannot acknowledge
its affiliation with SD-6.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.080
But they can't afford
to let these people get

04:42.081 --> 04:43.849
whatever it is they're here for.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.617
Do nothing.

04:45.618 --> 04:46.952
The man running this group

04:46.953 --> 04:49.321
claims to be
a former SD-6 freelancer.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.690
Says Sloane left him
for dead in Chechnya.

04:51.691 --> 04:56.094
He's interrogating Sloane now,
maybe killing him.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.662
And we're next.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.932
Sydney's in the ducts.

05:00.933 --> 05:01.933
What?

05:01.934 --> 05:04.136
Failsafe's been activated.

05:04.137 --> 05:08.005
If the vault's opened,
it'll detonate C-4 charges

05:08.074 --> 05:10.838
hidden throughout
the building's sublevel.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.078
Sydney has a chance
to disarm them,

05:13.079 --> 05:15.946
but only if there are
no surprises.

05:16.015 --> 05:19.781
All the more reason
we need to call Langley.

05:19.852 --> 05:24.721
Jack, under normal conditions,
you can pull rank.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.919
These are not normal conditions.

06:18.077 --> 06:19.411
<i>Each set of C-4 charges</i>

06:19.412 --> 06:20.779
<i>are located
behind the steel plate</i>

06:20.780 --> 06:23.408
<i>at the end of the corridor
as marked on the map.</i>

06:50.743 --> 06:53.211
2 numbers down, 10 to go.

06:53.212 --> 06:55.712
Copy that, baby.

06:58.317 --> 07:01.684
You know,
as bad as you feel right now

07:01.754 --> 07:04.089
with all that pain,

07:04.090 --> 07:06.590
that is just the puddin'
next to the pie.

07:08.628 --> 07:11.128
So easy for you
to blame me, huh?

07:11.164 --> 07:13.632
When you know the truth.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.600
You got your own men killed.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.969
That helicopter waited for you.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.738
I had a man down.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.807
I was saving Whitney's life.
You knew that.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.800
At the expense
of all the other men.

07:24.911 --> 07:28.347
Those men counted on you
to lead them to safety.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.948
They trusted their life to you.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.680
And you led them to slaughter.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.193
Go check it out.

08:16.929 --> 08:19.429
Yeah.

09:12.418 --> 09:15.012
No, no, no.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.938
Three of the security
monitors just lost picture.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.243
Then check it out.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.744
Yes, sir.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.860
Okay, you ready for this?

09:55.861 --> 09:58.096
Langley's general
P.O.P. Server just received

09:58.097 --> 10:00.031
an incoming E-mail from SD-6.

10:00.032 --> 10:01.099
From who? Jack?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.068
No, not Jack. Dixon.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.103
Why is Dixon sending me E-mail?
He doesn't know me.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.605
He's calling the CIA for help.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.106
They forwarded
this message to you.

10:09.742 --> 10:12.711
"I am Marcus Dixon.
Agent of SD-6.

10:12.778 --> 10:13.812
We are under attack.
Help us. "

10:13.813 --> 10:15.547
What do you think's going on?

10:15.548 --> 10:16.615
Vaughn, hey.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.683
No, not now.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.085
- Sir, we have a situation.
- Mr. Vaughn.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.586
I really think
you should look at this.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.055
You've had a bad day.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.790
You better hope
this doesn't make it worse.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.993
I know I've been suspended
as Sydney Bristow's handler,

10:27.994 --> 10:29.961
but this message
was routed to me.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.954
Sir, if you don't mind, may
I see the communication, please?

10:33.032 --> 10:36.126
It is my province, and Vaughn
is off the Bristow case.

10:38.604 --> 10:40.572
Do we have
any independent confirmation?

10:40.573 --> 10:42.040
Like a dead body? No.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.142
It's a fair question.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.143
No, sir.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.045
Any local authorities reporting?
Fire, police?

10:48.114 --> 10:49.147
No.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.448
Any irregularities at all?

10:50.449 --> 10:51.983
Other than a desperate message

10:51.984 --> 10:53.618
from an agent
begging for our help?

10:53.619 --> 10:54.953
You want to send in
an extraction team.

10:54.954 --> 10:55.954
We have to do something.

10:55.955 --> 10:58.423
Like we had to do something
in Dinatti Park?

10:58.424 --> 11:00.325
- I think this is Sloane.
- What?

11:00.326 --> 11:02.394
He's bluffing. He's trying
to compromise our operation.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.863
By sending CIA into SD-6?
Are you nuts?

11:04.864 --> 11:06.665
Sloane is bold like that,
and you're reactive.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.166
Sir, why is he
even in this office?

11:08.167 --> 11:09.167
We wait for now.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.935
- But, sir...
- We wait.

11:10.936 --> 11:13.436
Is that understood?

11:21.914 --> 11:25.350
Go back to Devlin's office
and convince him on your own.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.651
You can't go by yourself.

11:26.652 --> 11:28.319
I have a friend who's a cop.
He went to the lobby.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.788
The guard told him
the bank closed early.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.256
- Maybe it did.
- I would have known.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.624
What if there has been
a takeover?

11:32.625 --> 11:35.321
If I'm not back in a couple
hours, I'm probably dead.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.497
Good to know.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.726
That's five.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.227
Copy that, baby.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.963
Well...

12:13.632 --> 12:16.132
It's almost over.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.994
I'm a federal officer.
Step out of the car, please.

14:55.995 --> 14:57.562
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.063
No problem.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.092
Have you seen Mr. Weiss?

15:28.093 --> 15:30.428
I have Mr. Vaughn
calling for him.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.929
I'll take the call.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.702
Extraction teams "R" us.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.938
- Where's Weiss?
- Probably getting pizza.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.439
The confirmation you wanted.
I got it.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.707
I'm at SD-6 right now.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.742
- You're at SD-6?
- Did you hear what I said?

15:44.743 --> 15:46.744
That is a massive breach
of protocol.

15:46.745 --> 15:49.013
- Screw protocol.
- Devlin told you to wait.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.349
The break-in is confirmed.
Check with the duty officer.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.618
It's probably Bendis.
Tell him to send in the team.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.144
They can get in the garage
using a standard card splice.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.622
You're finished.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.123
Just do it!

16:07.366 --> 16:09.133
Tchen, what's up?

16:09.134 --> 16:11.634
Where are we?
I need status.

16:20.346 --> 16:23.679
Tell him everything's cool.
You're still checking it out.

16:23.749 --> 16:26.249
- Tchen, where the hell are you?
- Do it.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.785
Screw you.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.621
I'm disappointed.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.360
Being a reporter sucks.
Can I just establish that?

16:45.471 --> 16:47.138
- Okay.
- Hi.

16:47.139 --> 16:49.240
Hi, and what
have we been drinking?

16:49.241 --> 16:50.375
I don't know.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.443
It was something
with a horse on the label.

16:52.444 --> 16:53.978
Dog.
It was like a dog horse.

16:53.979 --> 16:56.743
A mythical creature condemned to
live in a bottle for eternity.

16:56.815 --> 16:58.349
It's like a dog horse.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.114
Oh, did I mention
that my life sucks?

17:04.623 --> 17:06.691
The Rileys forgive you.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.358
It's the seating arrangement
for the wedding.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.660
My God, that's so normal.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.528
Your life is so normal, Fran.

17:12.598 --> 17:13.931
Sydney's life's normal, too.

17:13.932 --> 17:16.492
Kind of normal, outside of
her obsession with the bank.

17:16.568 --> 17:18.169
My life is not normal.

17:18.170 --> 17:21.162
This story I'm working on
is about this guy in jail.

17:21.272 --> 17:24.709
His wife committed suicide.
It's just very suspicious.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.277
The guy's been totally set up.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.846
He's a good guy.
He's got no criminal record.

17:29.915 --> 17:32.383
He's got two speeding tickets
in his life.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.752
He's been in jail
for eight years.

17:34.753 --> 17:37.088
He's got
another eight years to go.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.819
So I went to see him
'cause I thought that maybe

17:39.892 --> 17:41.592
I could shed some light
on the thing.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.294
Maybe I could research
and write an article

17:43.295 --> 17:45.596
that might do some justice.

17:45.597 --> 17:49.966
But he was so scared.

17:50.035 --> 17:55.371
He had this look in his eyes.
It was like horror.

17:55.441 --> 17:58.171
I stopped doing the story.
It's his life.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.768
He wants to make
his own decisions.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.713
And then his kid
comes to see me.

18:02.714 --> 18:05.214
- His kid?
- His kid.

18:05.517 --> 18:08.179
And she begged me
to help out her dad.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.753
She was just so desperate.

18:11.523 --> 18:13.624
Then I got this key.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.125
Pier 19. Number 305.
I don't know.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.261
What's there?

18:17.262 --> 18:18.696
I don't know.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.131
How'd you get it?

18:20.132 --> 18:23.192
I don't want to tell you.

18:23.268 --> 18:23.801
Why?

18:23.802 --> 18:25.336
It's very dangerous.

18:25.337 --> 18:26.471
Okay.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.972
Francie, I'm serious.

18:30.642 --> 18:32.310
Will, if I were you,

18:32.311 --> 18:34.811
and I thought I might
be able to help somebody,

18:34.913 --> 18:37.413
I would.

18:44.256 --> 18:45.923
Have you seen Tchen?

18:45.924 --> 18:46.991
Not lately.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.259
I feel like a mom at the mall.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.727
He said he was going
down to the sub-basement.

18:49.728 --> 18:51.996
I don't know if his walkie's not
working, he's on a coffee break.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.698
Five numbers down, seven to go.

18:53.699 --> 18:55.366
The code program's running.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.867
I'll go get him.

18:58.103 --> 18:59.937
Who is more tough-assed
than you?

18:59.938 --> 19:02.438
Who?
Nobody, baby!

19:16.188 --> 19:18.089
What the hell
are you doing here?

19:18.090 --> 19:19.490
Dixon contacted us.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.726
- Dixon contacted you?
- Through Langley.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.094
Said SD-6 was under attack.
Are you okay?

19:23.095 --> 19:24.428
There's a team
of six, maybe seven.

19:24.429 --> 19:26.364
They've got
the latest military spec.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.532
They're after something
in the vault.

19:27.533 --> 19:28.733
I took one out in the garage.

19:28.734 --> 19:29.734
Russian accent?

19:29.735 --> 19:30.868
Yeah.
I was thinking K-Directorate.

19:30.869 --> 19:33.237
I don't think they'd do
something as wild as this.

19:33.238 --> 19:35.239
- Then who?
- I don't know.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.471
But right now, what do you know
about deactivating C-4?

19:38.544 --> 19:40.411
There's got to be
200 pounds in here.

19:40.412 --> 19:42.246
That's enough
to level the building.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.247
It's a failsafe.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.749
Sloane has three of these
rigged to the vault.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.150
If the vault door opens,
they all blow.

19:46.151 --> 19:47.485
Maybe they shouldn't
open the vault.

19:47.486 --> 19:49.253
"They" being the six men
with machine guns?

19:49.254 --> 19:50.922
How long
before they hack the code?

19:50.923 --> 19:53.057
Soon. Did you study
bomb defusion at Langley?

19:53.058 --> 19:54.659
Seminar-style.
Nothing field-specific.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.661
Does anyone ever learn
anything in seminars?

19:56.662 --> 19:58.262
Let's take this
one step at a time.

19:58.263 --> 20:00.097
This is a charge of C-4.

20:00.098 --> 20:02.433
I can tell 'cause it says
"C-4" everywhere.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.802
There are eight
black and yellow wires

20:04.803 --> 20:05.937
and six red, blue, and black.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.372
Which of these 14 wires
do we cut?

20:08.373 --> 20:10.541
Maybe none.
What are those prisms?

20:10.542 --> 20:11.542
I don't know, but there might be

20:11.543 --> 20:13.844
more than one lead spliced
to the firing mechanism.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.913
- That pin.
- Where?

20:15.914 --> 20:17.148
There, in the back.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.616
What is that?

20:18.617 --> 20:20.084
It's a crystal.

20:20.085 --> 20:21.986
That thing is a radio receiver.

20:21.987 --> 20:24.422
That's probably how opening
the vault triggers the C-4.

20:24.423 --> 20:27.256
So all we have to do
is pull out the crystal?

20:29.995 --> 20:32.029
Wait, no.
It can't be this easy.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.631
You think
there's a tamper alarm?

20:33.632 --> 20:36.132
Or a secondary trigger.

20:44.710 --> 20:47.044
Now we know
what the prisms are for.

20:47.045 --> 20:49.545
Spray it again.

20:49.815 --> 20:52.807
I think I can pull out
the crystal

20:52.884 --> 20:54.418
without touching the lasers.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.387
You want me to do it?
My hands are pretty steady.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.888
Well, so are mine.

21:01.727 --> 21:04.227
One more spray on 3.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.429
1...

21:05.430 --> 21:06.364
2...

21:06.365 --> 21:08.865
3.

21:17.309 --> 21:18.309
One down.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.011
We better hurry.

21:34.826 --> 21:37.326
Inside.

21:38.997 --> 21:41.497
Over there.

21:46.405 --> 21:48.905
Tie his hands.

21:56.948 --> 21:59.116
Don't!

21:59.117 --> 22:01.617
Why don't you tie her up?

22:01.853 --> 22:03.587
- Wait.
- Shut up.

22:03.588 --> 22:05.289
I'm British S.I.S.

22:05.290 --> 22:07.658
For the past year,
I've been on covert duty

22:07.659 --> 22:10.127
trying to penetrate
Cole's intelligence network.

22:10.128 --> 22:12.688
- Cole?
- McKenas Cole, former SD-6.

22:12.764 --> 22:15.494
Now he works with a third party.
New player on the scene.

22:15.567 --> 22:17.335
Someone he calls "The Man. "

22:17.336 --> 22:19.637
S.I.S. Has been trying
to identify "The Man"

22:19.638 --> 22:20.905
for the past three years.

22:20.906 --> 22:22.273
- Give me your tie.
- My tie?

22:22.274 --> 22:23.507
If this mission's a success,

22:23.508 --> 22:26.008
Cole will trust me enough
to tell me who that man is.

22:26.078 --> 22:29.241
- What's in the vault?
- I don't know. None of us do.

22:29.314 --> 22:32.112
But it has to do
with someone named Rambaldi.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.554
If you don't let me go,

22:36.555 --> 22:38.189
Cole will send someone
looking for me.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.424
He'll know there's someone else
here, and they'll find you.

22:40.425 --> 22:42.693
If you're lying,
you'll make sure that happens.

22:42.694 --> 22:46.130
When they find me, I'll tell
them there's only one of you.

24:10.315 --> 24:12.650
The other C-4 packages
are here and here.

24:12.651 --> 24:13.918
We'll split up.
Each take one.

24:13.919 --> 24:15.920
The explosives are located
behind steel plates

24:15.921 --> 24:17.254
that are bolted to the walls.

24:17.255 --> 24:18.756
Which you opened by yourself?

24:18.757 --> 24:21.091
There are fire extinguishers
at regulation points.

24:21.092 --> 24:23.592
Use the CO2 to freeze the bolts,
but go easy or you'll run out.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.496
Okay, here.

24:25.497 --> 24:27.398
I memorized the laser grid.

24:27.399 --> 24:28.599
Here.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.601
Your C-4 is located
along this corridor.

24:30.602 --> 24:33.264
You cross through engineering
sublevel over to electrical.

24:33.371 --> 24:34.472
It's far, so run.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.340
The storage room where I got in.
That's where we'll meet.

24:36.341 --> 24:38.209
Maybe we can go
to that hockey game.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.710
Maybe. Be careful.

24:39.711 --> 24:42.211
You too.

24:43.748 --> 24:46.217
I understand you took
a call from Vaughn.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.852
Now that you mention it.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.186
A call he made to me.

24:49.187 --> 24:50.988
What did he say?

24:50.989 --> 24:52.523
I don't know.
It was a bad connection.

24:52.524 --> 24:53.691
Did he confirm the attack?

24:53.692 --> 24:55.659
He was hysterical, per usual.

24:55.660 --> 24:58.160
I wouldn't read much into it.

25:05.871 --> 25:09.637
Tchen, Toni, does anyone copy?

25:09.708 --> 25:11.075
Cole, this is Endo.

25:11.076 --> 25:12.910
Endo, this has got to stop.

25:12.911 --> 25:15.079
Look, you find Toni,
you find Tchen,

25:15.080 --> 25:17.674
and you find the problem,
and then you fix it!

25:41.573 --> 25:43.274
How many were there?

25:43.275 --> 25:45.775
One. Only one.

26:53.378 --> 26:55.045
Endo.

26:55.046 --> 26:57.181
Endo, Tchen.
Somebody come in.

26:57.182 --> 26:59.383
Who the hell's shooting?

26:59.384 --> 27:01.819
Cole, Tchen's dead.

27:01.820 --> 27:04.320
Well, who the hell killed him?

27:05.090 --> 27:07.590
I did.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.793
Endo. Endo.

27:12.263 --> 27:14.763
Endo!

27:20.305 --> 27:23.638
Dear person
beating up my men...

27:23.708 --> 27:26.472
I assume that you're
an employee here.

27:26.544 --> 27:27.811
I am now standing

27:27.812 --> 27:31.441
in Sloane's tastefully
minimalistic office.

27:31.516 --> 27:34.178
And if you are not here,
standing in front of me

27:34.252 --> 27:35.719
in the next 20 seconds,

27:35.720 --> 27:39.451
I am gonna start
executing your friends,

27:39.524 --> 27:43.085
starting with the man that
I assume to be your partner.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.996
Mr. Jack Bristow.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.029
I'm here.

28:20.732 --> 28:24.634
You're the badass
that's been killing my men?

28:24.703 --> 28:26.170
I don't know.

28:26.171 --> 28:28.205
I thought you'd be an ugly guy.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.706
- Damn it.
- Step in, girlie.

28:35.580 --> 28:38.080
Get her bag.

28:40.785 --> 28:43.285
Search her.

28:44.789 --> 28:45.923
Good and tight.

28:45.924 --> 28:48.424
Seven numbers locked.
Five to go.

28:50.695 --> 28:54.563
If she moves a muscle,
you drill her.

29:00.705 --> 29:03.006
I want LAPD notified, roadblocks
at appropriate intersections,

29:03.007 --> 29:04.441
and an ambulance standing by.

29:04.442 --> 29:06.009
- Weiss, you've got a call.
- Not now.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.278
It's Vaughn, line three.

29:08.279 --> 29:09.513
Talk to me.

29:09.514 --> 29:11.181
- Where the hell are you?
- We're on our way.

29:11.182 --> 29:14.015
The place is wired to blow.
Three packages of C-4.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.419
We deactivated two.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.720
Sydney was supposed to
deactivate the third.

29:16.721 --> 29:17.721
I don't know if she did.

29:17.722 --> 29:19.957
- Okay, can you get to it?
- I don't know where it is.

29:19.958 --> 29:22.552
They've got everyone,
including Sydney.

29:22.627 --> 29:24.595
As soon as they open the vault,
the C-4 is gonna go off.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.363
- How soon is that?
- Soon. Hurry up.

29:26.364 --> 29:27.531
Got it.

29:27.532 --> 29:28.532
What the hell is going on?

29:28.533 --> 29:31.502
If I find out that you screwed
Vaughn, your ass is mine.

29:31.569 --> 29:32.603
I'm not scared of you.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.104
You should start
being scared of me.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.083
You know, a lot of guys,

29:46.084 --> 29:50.851
it's their socks or their piece.

29:50.922 --> 29:54.016
Their gun, bullets...

29:54.092 --> 29:55.926
custom hollow tips.

29:55.927 --> 30:00.557
But for me,
I have always sucked my luck

30:00.632 --> 30:03.692
from a bottle of champagne.

30:03.768 --> 30:06.635
I bring one every job.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.911
Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm!

30:13.912 --> 30:14.978
Ahh.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.479
Would you care for some?

30:32.363 --> 30:33.797
You don't remember, do you?

30:33.798 --> 30:36.298
I didn't at first, either.

30:36.734 --> 30:39.234
We've met before.

30:39.237 --> 30:43.435
It was about five years ago
here at SD-6...

30:43.541 --> 30:45.042
which was really rare for me,

30:45.043 --> 30:47.978
'cause I was a freelancer,
but I was here.

30:48.046 --> 30:51.311
And I saw you
in the coffee room.

30:51.382 --> 30:53.217
You were wearing pigtails.

30:53.218 --> 30:54.718
And I asked you out.

30:54.719 --> 30:58.155
Now, I know I'm not
the subtlest guy

30:58.223 --> 30:59.756
when it comes to women.

30:59.757 --> 31:03.853
And I probably said something
insanely inappropriate,

31:03.928 --> 31:07.659
because you told me
if I ever talked to you again,

31:07.732 --> 31:10.232
you'd break my kneecaps.

31:13.471 --> 31:15.971
Which just made me love you.

31:18.142 --> 31:20.642
I've thought about you
these last five years.

31:20.745 --> 31:22.079
I have.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.814
Just every once
in a while, I think,

31:23.815 --> 31:26.750
"I wonder what ever happened
to Pigtails?"

31:26.818 --> 31:29.912
And what I took away

31:29.988 --> 31:31.922
from that encounter
in the coffee room

31:31.923 --> 31:34.291
was the fact that
you didn't want to go see

31:34.292 --> 31:37.386
some mediocre romantic comedy
with me,

31:37.462 --> 31:40.454
sit in my Pontiac
in the parking lot

31:40.531 --> 31:43.659
while we talked for an hour
before I made my move.

31:44.869 --> 31:47.565
You didn't want to kiss me.

31:47.672 --> 31:48.839
Remember?

31:48.840 --> 31:51.340
No, I do not.

31:51.976 --> 31:54.740
But I can see
not wanting to kiss you.

31:57.782 --> 32:00.580
Well, you make bad choices.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.087
Yeah, you didn't want
to kiss me,

32:05.123 --> 32:07.224
but working for a scumbag
like Sloane,

32:07.225 --> 32:10.023
that's all right by you, huh?

32:10.094 --> 32:13.393
Let me tell you something
about that weasel boss of yours.

32:13.464 --> 32:16.228
He will disappoint you.

32:17.335 --> 32:18.602
And one day,

32:18.603 --> 32:21.231
and I hope to God I'm there
when that day happens,

32:21.339 --> 32:23.967
you will hate him.

32:28.046 --> 32:30.947
It was good to see you
in the office again, Pigtails.

32:31.015 --> 32:33.643
I know you didn't want
to kiss me,

32:33.718 --> 32:36.482
but when I was taking a hit
off that bottle before,

32:36.554 --> 32:38.055
I backwashed in it.

32:38.056 --> 32:41.787
I mean, really big-time.

32:41.859 --> 32:44.359
See ya.

32:48.299 --> 32:49.900
I didn't think you'd come.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.234
I know. Me neither.

32:51.235 --> 32:52.869
I made sure I wasn't followed.

32:52.870 --> 32:55.272
I took two cabs and a bus
to get here.

32:55.273 --> 32:57.207
But I wore this the whole time.

32:57.208 --> 32:58.508
I thought I'd look
like Gabe Kaplan.

32:58.509 --> 33:00.544
- Who's that?
- Doesn't matter.

33:00.545 --> 33:02.379
Are you sure
you still want to do this?

33:02.380 --> 33:03.847
You know I do.

33:03.848 --> 33:05.415
Okay.

33:05.416 --> 33:07.916
You got to give this
to your dad, then.

33:07.919 --> 33:09.086
What is it?

33:09.087 --> 33:11.681
- I don't want you to look.
- Tell me what it is.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.790
It's your mother's autopsy.

33:13.791 --> 33:15.959
There are photographs that
you're not gonna want to see.

33:15.960 --> 33:18.028
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

33:18.029 --> 33:21.192
Okay, what you said to me
about going away,

33:21.265 --> 33:23.266
if your father's
gonna pursue this,

33:23.267 --> 33:25.767
you have got to do that.

33:38.049 --> 33:40.549
Do you remember Griff?

33:41.119 --> 33:42.586
That big guy?

33:42.587 --> 33:46.216
Well, the MVDs
worked him over really hard.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.560
They had straps
with blades in them.

33:50.561 --> 33:54.361
These tricky glass syringes.
Acid.

33:54.432 --> 33:56.992
They were really creative.

33:57.068 --> 33:58.735
But he didn't go down.

33:58.736 --> 34:01.038
Not until
they opened up the box.

34:01.039 --> 34:04.998
It took him about three needles.
Then his heart gave out.

34:05.109 --> 34:07.703
How many did you take?

34:07.779 --> 34:10.339
I want to hear you scream.

34:11.416 --> 34:15.045
Just the way that Griff did.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.889
Scream for me.

34:28.632 --> 34:31.132
They broke you, didn't they?

34:33.504 --> 34:34.737
They made you beg.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.074
- Don't you wish.
- Only one number left.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.574
"I can't take any more. "
Isn't that what you said?

34:39.677 --> 34:41.178
Do you know how many more
needles I have here?

34:41.179 --> 34:42.279
I know what you did.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.780
- Let's go.
- You cried for mercy.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.581
- That is not what happened.
- The vault's almost open.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.108
- You wept like a baby.
- That is not what happened!

34:48.186 --> 34:50.620
- A little baby!
- We have to go!

34:50.621 --> 34:52.656
Shut up! Shut up!

34:52.657 --> 34:55.157
- Cole, come on!
- Shut up!

35:07.105 --> 35:09.605
Baby?

35:11.909 --> 35:14.409
Baby?

35:25.556 --> 35:28.056
I have to go to the vault.

36:01.025 --> 36:04.017
Chopper, I want you
to kill them all.

36:06.364 --> 36:09.128
Back up, all of you!
Up against the wall now!

36:09.200 --> 36:11.434
- All of you!
- Lisbon.

36:11.435 --> 36:13.935
- What?
- Last July.

36:14.572 --> 36:16.406
Now! Now!

36:16.407 --> 36:19.638
Get him up there!
Get against the wall! Come on!

36:19.710 --> 36:21.845
Don't look at me like that.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.280
Get against that wall.

36:23.281 --> 36:24.581
You heard him.

36:24.582 --> 36:25.682
Get against that wall.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.584
Hey, all of you!

36:27.585 --> 36:30.085
Hold them there!

36:48.039 --> 36:49.406
Can you shut off the failsafe?

36:49.407 --> 36:51.608
- Only Sloane can do that.
- I'm going to the vault.

36:51.609 --> 36:53.643
- I'm going with you.
- You just had surgery.

36:53.644 --> 36:56.144
I'll meet you there!

36:57.615 --> 36:58.748
Arvin.

36:58.749 --> 37:00.684
Did you execute the failsafe?

37:00.685 --> 37:02.852
- Yes.
- We need to deactivate it.

37:02.853 --> 37:05.121
- Are they still in the building?
- There's only one left.

37:05.122 --> 37:07.390
- I won't let anyone in.
- Sydney's gonna stop them.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.826
- Is Sydney here?
- How do I shut off the failsafe?

37:09.827 --> 37:11.895
The override is a keypad
in my office,

37:11.896 --> 37:13.663
but it's biometric.

37:13.664 --> 37:16.258
It won't deactivate
without my fingerprint.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.495
Come on, Jack,
it's gonna take you hours

37:21.606 --> 37:23.273
to get my hands out of here.

37:23.274 --> 37:26.710
Marshall has a device that can
duplicate fingerprints,

37:26.811 --> 37:28.411
but we haven't got the time.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.245
You could take my fingerprint.

37:31.315 --> 37:33.483
Jack...

37:33.484 --> 37:36.681
take my right index fingerprint.

37:39.290 --> 37:41.790
Just take it.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.770
Right index.

38:15.993 --> 38:18.493
Yes!

38:24.268 --> 38:26.768
Looking for me?

38:30.875 --> 38:32.542
Ooh!
Felt that one, didn't you?

38:32.543 --> 38:34.077
Kickboxer, Eh?

38:34.078 --> 38:36.578
I love me kickboxers.

38:41.052 --> 38:44.886
I got your kicks,
and I got your moves.

38:46.190 --> 38:48.690
Bring it on.

38:57.468 --> 38:59.602
That's the problem
with you kickboxers.

38:59.603 --> 39:02.504
Ain't none of y'all
can take a punch!

39:02.606 --> 39:05.336
Systems accessed.

39:07.611 --> 39:10.603
Ah, yessiree.

40:40.504 --> 40:42.705
I think you're right.

40:42.706 --> 40:46.437
Taking a punch is something
I got to learn how to do.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.685
What's happening downstairs?

40:55.686 --> 40:58.186
I think everything's
taken care of.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.355
We got lucky.

40:59.356 --> 41:01.157
Get my guys out of here.

41:01.158 --> 41:03.026
SD-6 will never know
we were here.

41:03.027 --> 41:04.194
Then you should go.

41:04.195 --> 41:05.628
You okay?

41:05.629 --> 41:07.897
Yeah.

41:07.898 --> 41:10.398
Thanks for coming.

41:10.601 --> 41:13.195
He had this.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.804
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:17.942 --> 41:19.409
What is that? Perfume?

41:19.410 --> 41:21.478
Whatever this is,
we have it now,

41:21.479 --> 41:23.580
and they don't, because of you.

41:23.581 --> 41:25.982
- Not just me.
- Because of you.

41:25.983 --> 41:27.984
Well, it better be good perfume.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.886
I'm not kidding.
Think about it.

41:29.887 --> 41:31.421
What you do.

41:31.422 --> 41:32.856
Hockey can wait.

41:32.857 --> 41:35.849
I don't think
what you're doing here can.

41:35.926 --> 41:37.327
Let's go.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.362
Okay. Bye.

41:39.363 --> 41:41.863
Bye.

41:58.115 --> 42:01.846
<i># For you #</i>

42:01.919 --> 42:06.788

no more crying #</i>

42:28.546 --> 42:32.607

42:44.328 --> 42:45.762
Are you all right?

42:45.763 --> 42:48.263
None of us are.

42:49.466 --> 42:51.966
What happened here tonight is...

42:52.736 --> 42:55.637
This is unacceptable.

42:55.706 --> 42:58.206
The people who did this.

42:58.208 --> 43:02.008
We're gonna find them,
retrieve what they've taken.

43:03.781 --> 43:06.281
Even then...

43:08.552 --> 43:11.052
This has changed everything.

43:13.324 --> 43:16.885
Sir, I got the digit here.
The medics are on their way.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.262
Thanks, Marshall.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.763
Hey, Sloane gave me the finger.

43:23.734 --> 43:28.103
<i># And the songbirds
are singing #</i>

43:28.205 --> 43:30.799
<i># Like they know the score #</i>

43:30.908 --> 43:33.408
- Okay?
- Yeah.

43:40.150 --> 43:41.517
You okay?

43:41.518 --> 43:44.078
I sent the E-mail to Langley,

43:44.154 --> 43:45.722
but I guess
it didn't get through.

43:45.723 --> 43:47.890
It's okay.

43:47.891 --> 43:50.391
You did a good job.

43:54.932 --> 44:00.871
<i># And I wish you all the love
in the world #</i>

44:00.971 --> 44:06.068
This morning, before all this,
you wanted to talk to Sloane.

44:07.344 --> 44:08.611
What did you tell him?

44:08.612 --> 44:11.376
I told him that
I'd see him tomorrow.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.817
Thank you.

44:16.220 --> 44:19.485
