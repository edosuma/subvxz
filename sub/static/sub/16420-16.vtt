- Wait, what's that,

19:59.166 --> 20:01.125
some disease?

20:01.166 --> 20:05.875
- Nooo!

20:01.166 --> 20:05.875
It's a superpower.

20:05.917 --> 20:07.834

20:05.917 --> 20:07.834
a Cuban zip spike at me,

20:07.875 --> 20:09.917
I can just knock it away.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.792
- Oh yeah?

20:09.959 --> 20:12.792

20:29.333 --> 20:31.458
seats with you?

20:33.208 --> 20:35.375
- All right!

20:33.208 --> 20:35.375
Maybe I can't hurt Kid Danger...

20:35.417 --> 20:37.959
or Captain Man...

20:38.000 --> 20:42.208
...but I can hurt Danny Chest!

20:42.250 --> 20:44.625

20:47.625 --> 20:49.375
Security!

20:51.542 --> 20:53.000
- Should we uh...?

20:51.542 --> 20:53.000
Maybe we should...

20:53.041 --> 20:54.959
- Just jump in there?

20:53.041 --> 20:54.959
I mean we are super...
