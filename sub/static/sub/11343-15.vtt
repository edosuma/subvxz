WEBVTT

00:01.497 --> 00:03.294
'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.337 --> 00:06.932
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.977 --> 00:10.765
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.817 --> 00:14.253
'are members of an elite squad,
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.297 --> 00:16.492
'These are their stories.'

00:18.057 --> 00:20.571
I got a great deal
on a George Foreman grill.

00:20.617 --> 00:22.926
EBay, one click, presto!

00:22.977 --> 00:26.174
Presto, what? Sloppy seconds
on a re-fried barbecue?

00:26.217 --> 00:29.971
- No way, this is good stuff, original.
- Then it's hot.

00:30.017 --> 00:32.247
Rise and shine, lovebirds.

00:33.257 --> 00:37.045
Blaupunkt radio. Log on to eBay,
it's yours for a song.

00:38.937 --> 00:42.009
No, they didn't take the radio,
they took his head off.

00:42.057 --> 00:43.695
And they took his pants, too.

00:45.777 --> 00:48.575
- Any spent rounds?
- A.44 in the gear-shift box.

00:48.617 --> 00:50.573
- Only one?
- So far.

00:50.617 --> 00:52.653
We did find fingerprints, though.

00:52.697 --> 00:55.131
Oh. Packed inside the emergency brake.

00:55.177 --> 00:57.247
He won't be using those any more.

00:57.297 --> 00:59.811
'Four o'clock. Love 30.'
Is that a meat market?

00:59.857 --> 01:02.849
Gym. Eastside.
More squash than treadmill.

01:03.577 --> 01:07.013
- Neighbours think they heard the shots.
- What did you hear?

01:07.057 --> 01:09.332
A high-pitched pop, hollow sounding.

01:09.377 --> 01:11.811
- Loud?
- Yeah, it woke up the baby.

01:11.857 --> 01:14.769
- But I didn't see anything.
- What time was that?

01:14.817 --> 01:18.651
2:00, 2:30. I heard it because
I had the window open.

01:18.697 --> 01:22.292
- In this weather?
- Our radiator's stuck on full.

01:22.337 --> 01:25.249
- May I give my statement, please?
- By all means.

01:25.297 --> 01:28.607
I'm sorry. It's just that the market
opened 20 minutes ago.

01:28.657 --> 01:31.410
- Please.
- I heard more of a boom.

01:32.337 --> 01:35.295
- A boom?
- Yes. Not a pop, a boom.

01:35.337 --> 01:40.286
- Why didn't you call the police?
- Gunshots, car alarms, helicopters, sirens.

01:40.337 --> 01:42.453
I'd be on the phone half my life.

02:29.857 --> 02:33.406
The body was found this morning,
shot through the back of the head.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.812
The victim was Dean Woodruff,
35 years old.

02:35.857 --> 02:38.246
He sold fitness equipment
on Lower Broadway.

02:38.297 --> 02:40.857
Divorced once.
Has an ex-wife, two kids upstate.

02:40.897 --> 02:42.853
- Girlfriend?
- We're looking.

02:42.897 --> 02:46.014
- His parents live near Saratoga.
- Any witnesses?

02:46.057 --> 02:48.855
A few heard a shot, but no eyewitnesses.

02:48.897 --> 02:52.367
- It was between 2:00 and 2:30.
- The victim in his own car?

02:52.417 --> 02:55.170
His sales region covers upstate and Jersey.

02:55.217 --> 02:58.175
One.44 slug
was recovered from the gearbox.

02:58.217 --> 03:00.856
.44. The shooter
was either a wacko or insecure.

03:00.897 --> 03:03.411
- Insecure?
- It's overkill and messy.

03:03.457 --> 03:06.847
- An amateur?
- A pro shoots twice with a.22.

03:06.897 --> 03:09.172
It's neat and you don't wake up babies.

03:09.217 --> 03:11.173
The scene is a big grope spot.

03:11.217 --> 03:14.050
Romantic.
Teenagers, honeymooners, co-workers.

03:14.097 --> 03:15.849
So, where's his love interest?

03:15.897 --> 03:18.809
- We're running down the prints.
- Maybe he was alone.

03:18.857 --> 03:21.610
Maybe his pants came off
from the force of the shot.

03:21.657 --> 03:25.775
He could have been having safe sex
with himself. Safe till he got shot.

03:25.817 --> 03:29.048
They've just started to pick through
the hair and glass.

03:29.097 --> 03:32.134
But I assume COD was a gunshot wound
to the back of the head.

03:32.177 --> 03:35.214
- Yeah, what's left of it.
- Is this bruises or lividity?

03:35.257 --> 03:37.213
I'd say it's just pooling.

03:37.257 --> 03:39.612
- Consistent with the 2:30 TOD?
- Mm-hm.

03:39.657 --> 03:41.807
- Under the fingernails?
- Dirt.

03:41.857 --> 03:45.167
You know his er... drawers were down.

03:45.217 --> 03:48.129
There's semen but don't get too excited.

03:48.177 --> 03:51.692
It could be part of the body's
natural death reflex.

03:54.697 --> 03:58.485
It's never too late to fulfil
that New Year's resolution. Welcome.

03:58.537 --> 04:00.971
I work out, just with different muscles.

04:01.017 --> 04:03.008
Detectives Jeffries and Munch.

04:03.057 --> 04:05.491
- You're here about Dean.
- Yes.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.848
Dean was more faithful than my wife.

04:11.857 --> 04:15.611
When he was in the city,
he came in early every day, 7:30.

04:15.657 --> 04:18.250
Took short lunches, didn't leave till late.

04:18.297 --> 04:22.336
Wow. Work macht frei.
What about on the road?

04:22.377 --> 04:25.653
He checked in often,
more than made his quota.

04:25.697 --> 04:27.972
- He was a good friend.
- Well-liked?

04:28.017 --> 04:31.168
Once he made a deal with a gym,
people would only deal with him.

04:31.217 --> 04:33.856
He had the largest
private client base of anyone.

04:33.897 --> 04:36.775
- We'll need a copy of that list.
- Of course.

04:36.817 --> 04:41.845
Excuse me. This is upsetting.

04:42.737 --> 04:44.329
It's unreal.

04:44.377 --> 04:48.336
You never think something like this
will happen to someone you know.

04:48.377 --> 04:52.006
- The two of you were friends?
- It's a close-knit group.

04:52.057 --> 04:54.617
But Dean was special.

04:54.657 --> 04:58.536
- Special how?
- He was popular around the office.

04:58.577 --> 05:01.569
- We'd all go out for drinks.
- Where would you go?

05:03.057 --> 05:05.048
Mostly to Le Bar.

05:07.897 --> 05:11.253
Let me guess,
he knocked the wrong person up

05:11.297 --> 05:13.253
or skipped out on alimony.

05:13.297 --> 05:16.334
- He had a way with women?
- Great technique.

05:16.377 --> 05:18.732
He compliments them on their shoes?

05:18.777 --> 05:21.655
He nurses a drink, looks sad.
She asks him what's wrong.

05:21.697 --> 05:25.326
He says his heart is breaking,
will he ever love again?

05:25.377 --> 05:27.333
It works every time.

05:27.377 --> 05:29.572
So, what happened?

05:30.857 --> 05:34.452
- So, last night, he died.
- Oh.

05:34.497 --> 05:38.172
Oh, but he was just in here last night.

05:38.217 --> 05:40.173
Do you know what time he left?

05:40.217 --> 05:44.608
I ran his card at... 11:55pm.

05:44.657 --> 05:49.447
God, he tipped 25 per cent.
He was the nicest guy.

05:49.497 --> 05:53.695
He used his expense account for four
vodka gimlets, two cosmopolitans.

05:53.737 --> 05:56.490
One Roadkill. Who'd he leave with?

05:56.537 --> 05:58.129
The women that come here?

05:58.177 --> 06:01.294
They're all thin and hungry
with cellphones attached.

06:01.337 --> 06:03.612
It could have been anyone.

06:03.657 --> 06:07.696
No, perfect. The only problem I had
with the guy was with his keys.

06:07.737 --> 06:10.490
- Keys?
- He gave away his key too easy.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.847
- I don't mean that he was easy.
- No, he was helping the homeless.

06:14.857 --> 06:18.406
Pretty much every woman,
and there were a lot of women,

06:18.457 --> 06:20.049
each left with her own key.

06:20.097 --> 06:23.851
Then things would go bad between them
so he'd change the lock.

06:23.897 --> 06:27.651
He paid for it but you're supposed
to go through management.

06:27.697 --> 06:29.813
Here we go.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.848
Hotel matches.

06:32.657 --> 06:36.252
Seashells. Cocktail napkins?

06:36.297 --> 06:40.051
- Souvenirs. How anal retentive.
- It's like he's expecting an audit.

06:40.097 --> 06:42.816
So some woman could tell him
he didn't give enough?

06:42.857 --> 06:46.691
- I'm sure he didn't have to wait.
- 'Our love is like the tide...'

06:46.737 --> 06:49.126
And now the tide is out.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.137
Hello?

06:53.177 --> 06:55.566
- Hello!
- Give me that.

06:57.857 --> 06:59.734
This is Detective Jeffries.

07:00.777 --> 07:02.176
Mm-hm.

07:04.897 --> 07:06.888
Excellent. Yeah. Thanks.

07:07.897 --> 07:10.855
Moira Shannon had not one
but two gun permits.

07:10.897 --> 07:14.412
- Either of them a.44?
- Yeah, and for a 9mm. No priors.

07:15.417 --> 07:17.408
What a past.

07:19.057 --> 07:22.015
Look at this. It's Moira.

07:22.057 --> 07:25.606
- She looks so happy there.
- She ain't happy no more.

07:25.657 --> 07:28.967
I haven't set foot into Le Bar in months.

07:29.017 --> 07:32.293
- You said it was your regular hang.
- Was.

07:32.337 --> 07:34.692
Not after he dumped me.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.732
- You have two gun permits.
- Yes.

07:38.777 --> 07:43.009
Look, I'm from upstate, it...

07:43.057 --> 07:45.890
It was one of the things
he and I had in common.

07:45.937 --> 07:48.656
My dad taught me to hunt.
I've always carried a gun.

07:48.697 --> 07:51.769
But you do have a.44 and a 9mm?

07:51.817 --> 07:56.208
The.44, that was just a phase.
It's a cannon, so impractical.

07:56.257 --> 07:59.647
The Glock is more user-friendly.
What did you do with the cannon?

07:59.697 --> 08:01.653
Sold it about a year after I got it.

08:01.697 --> 08:04.131
- Do you have a receipt?
- At home.

08:04.177 --> 08:06.737
I sold it to a gun shop in Duchess County.

08:06.777 --> 08:09.575
Is this the woman who left
with Mr Woodruff last night?

08:10.737 --> 08:14.776
- The vodka tonic, she's old news.
- OK, well, maybe one of these.

08:14.817 --> 08:17.650
I've tried to be helpful but I don't need this.

08:17.697 --> 08:20.575
- You're busy. We can come back.
- God, you people!

08:20.617 --> 08:22.892
Her, then me.

08:22.937 --> 08:26.646
The blonde, then me.
Some preppy little anorexic girl, then me.

08:26.697 --> 08:29.655
It wasn't you that left with him,
by any chance?

08:29.697 --> 08:32.211
She was over at their table for a while.

08:32.256 --> 08:35.328
They all come from the same
Upper Eastside gene pool.

08:35.376 --> 08:37.015
I'd never seen this one before.

08:37.057 --> 08:39.969
Usually Dean had to work
his line of tragic BS

08:40.017 --> 08:42.167
for a good ten minutes before he scored.

08:42.217 --> 08:45.926
With this one,
he hardly had to open his mouth.

08:45.977 --> 08:48.093
Anybody know this guy?

08:48.137 --> 08:50.776
Don't you mean excuse me for interrupting?

08:50.817 --> 08:52.808
Hey! Just...

08:52.857 --> 08:56.816
- Do you know this guy, hotshot?
- Should I?

08:56.857 --> 08:59.325
You want your collarbone in one piece, yes?

08:59.377 --> 09:02.414
Let's start again.
We're two of New York's finest.

09:02.457 --> 09:06.336
We'd like you to forget about
these kamikazes and pay attention.

09:10.337 --> 09:13.693
Oh, yeah, massive pecs, washboard abs.

09:13.737 --> 09:16.615
I called him the Willy Loman of dumbbells,

09:16.657 --> 09:19.729
which he didn't appreciate,
or else didn't get.

09:19.777 --> 09:22.132
Who did appreciate those quadriceps?

09:24.057 --> 09:26.048
One of the Mulroneys.

09:28.057 --> 09:30.617
Counting cousins and in-laws,
it's a huge clan.

09:30.657 --> 09:33.376
Of the daughters,
Stephanie's the only one left.

09:33.417 --> 09:37.251
She's something of a wild child.
Drunken rowdiness, college stuff,

09:37.297 --> 09:39.686
a possession bust
got her community service.

09:39.737 --> 09:42.456
Community service?
That's what Mulroneys do.

09:42.497 --> 09:46.046
Now she's 33 and runs some
socially-conscious investment group.

09:46.097 --> 09:49.772
Don't tell me. One cent
on every cigarette pack the family makes

09:49.817 --> 09:51.648
goes into lung cancer research?

09:51.697 --> 09:54.814
- Let's keep politics out of this.
- Good luck.

09:54.857 --> 09:58.406
Public service hides a multitude of sins,
some venial, some mortal.

09:58.457 --> 10:01.813
Right now she is
a reluctant witness, nothing more.

10:01.857 --> 10:04.212
If she just picked him up,
she'd be reluctant.

10:04.257 --> 10:06.930
The family has gone through
more than their share.

10:06.977 --> 10:09.207
You left a note at her apartment when?

10:09.257 --> 10:13.648
Er, three hours ago. We also left
a number of messages on her machine.

10:13.697 --> 10:17.406
Captain, there's some big mouthpiece
waiting for you in your office.

10:17.457 --> 10:20.893
- He wouldn't wait outside.
- Think Chappaquiddick, my friends.

10:20.937 --> 10:23.929
- These people don't talk.
- His name's Rumsey.

10:23.977 --> 10:28.095
Former Governor Mulroney's legal advisor.
That Rumsey?

10:30.137 --> 10:32.367
Memory lane.

10:32.417 --> 10:37.047
A lot of friends have served the city
honourably and well, Captain Cragen.

10:37.097 --> 10:38.928
I'm Patrick Rumsey.

10:38.977 --> 10:41.855
I assume you're here
to represent Miss Mulroney.

10:41.897 --> 10:45.128
I'm here as a family friend.
Stephanie witnessed the attack.

10:45.177 --> 10:49.967
- I'm offering to help.
- We want to interview Miss Mulroney.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.973
I understand, Captain.

10:52.017 --> 10:55.805
Meanwhile, I have a copy
of her statement here.

10:58.457 --> 11:00.175
Her statement?

11:00.217 --> 11:02.685
To give you the facts
while her memory is fresh.

11:02.737 --> 11:07.174
Thank you for your help, Mr Rumsey,
but we'll take our own statement.

11:07.217 --> 11:09.811
Of course, as soon as she's ready.

11:16.937 --> 11:20.816
Munch says they make 18 cents
for every pack of cigarettes sold.

11:20.857 --> 11:22.609
That's one of the rumours.

11:22.657 --> 11:26.616
And when the eldest daughter died,
2,000 mourners lined Fifth Avenue.

11:26.657 --> 11:30.445
- Munch says a lot so Cragen sent us.
- What's this?

11:32.017 --> 11:35.089
It's a cigar cutter.
Look, Winston Churchill, 1929.

11:35.137 --> 11:38.015
The real story is
Winnie lost it in a poker game.

11:38.057 --> 11:40.207
Churchill never carried much cash.

11:40.257 --> 11:43.806
And my father-in-law never extended credit.
Regina Mulroney.

11:43.857 --> 11:46.166
- Detective Benson.
- Detective Stabler.

11:47.777 --> 11:50.007
This is the worst sort of déjà vu.

11:51.297 --> 11:55.256
Every time a policeman has come to
our house, a family member has died.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.369
It's five years to the day
since my son went down

11:58.417 --> 12:02.376
in the fog off the Dalmatian coast
with the ambassador.

12:02.417 --> 12:05.853
- Your daughter was very lucky.
- Lucky? How?

12:05.897 --> 12:07.888
That she survived the attack.

12:07.937 --> 12:10.405
Oh, yes.

12:10.457 --> 12:12.846
My unplanned miracle child.

12:12.897 --> 12:16.207
- The light of my life.
- Is Stephanie here, Mrs Mulroney?

12:16.257 --> 12:19.647
- She has her own apartment.
- Yes, we know. We've been there.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.609
But children always go home
during a crisis, don't they?

12:22.657 --> 12:26.206
Yes, but I'm afraid she's in seclusion.

12:26.257 --> 12:29.329
- Where exactly? The Hamptons?
- No.

12:29.377 --> 12:31.891
In a private hospital. She's under sedation.

12:31.937 --> 12:35.213
Well, if you'd call her,
we won't overstay our welcome.

12:39.217 --> 12:42.448
Look, I'm a little uneasy.
This is a private clinic.

12:42.497 --> 12:45.057
Endowed by the Mulroneys. We get it.

12:45.897 --> 12:48.092
We admitted her early yesterday morning.

12:48.137 --> 12:50.571
- Where's her clothing?
- I beg your pardon?

12:50.617 --> 12:53.768
The clothes she wore
the night of the homicide.

12:53.817 --> 12:56.729
I believe she had changed
before she was admitted.

12:56.777 --> 13:00.133
- Admitted for what?
- Trauma, Detective.

13:00.177 --> 13:03.294
We treated the wounds and gave her
Seconal to calm her down.

13:04.337 --> 13:06.771
- We'll be brief, Miss Mulroney.
- I'm fine.

13:06.817 --> 13:08.216
And to the point.

13:10.217 --> 13:11.616
Thank you.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.926
Did you leave Le Bar
with Dean Woodruff?

13:15.937 --> 13:17.211
Yes.

13:17.257 --> 13:20.055
- And what time was that?
- I don't remember.

13:20.097 --> 13:21.928
Is that where you met him?

13:23.857 --> 13:26.007
I was having a rough day.

13:26.057 --> 13:28.412
He said he'd been having a rough day, too.

13:28.457 --> 13:32.052
OK, so you left the bar with him.
What happened in the car?

13:32.097 --> 13:36.056
He was leaning against the window
in the driver's seat facing me.

13:36.097 --> 13:39.772
He'd made a joke about
the disadvantages of bucket seats.

13:39.817 --> 13:41.808
Explain the joke?

13:42.857 --> 13:45.007
It's rather obvious, isn't it?

13:45.057 --> 13:48.970
Stephanie told him, 'Not so fast',
or something. Isn't that right?

13:51.737 --> 13:55.412
- Is that what you said?
- Something like that.

13:55.457 --> 13:58.608
I leaned over to change the radio station.

13:58.657 --> 14:01.967
What was playing?

14:02.017 --> 14:06.886
I don't know. And then it happened.

14:06.937 --> 14:09.132
Then what happened?

14:09.177 --> 14:11.486
The shooting occurred.

14:12.457 --> 14:14.527
What time was that?

14:15.377 --> 14:18.130
Can't remember?

14:18.177 --> 14:21.692
Can you describe the person
who did the shooting, Miss Mulroney?

14:22.737 --> 14:27.094
A man came up fast. Before
I could say anything, he had a gun out.

14:27.137 --> 14:30.493
- It was so loud!
- That's enough.

14:30.537 --> 14:34.052
- Did you get a look at him?
- He had black-rimmed glasses,

14:35.097 --> 14:38.089
dark hair and a roundish face.

14:38.137 --> 14:41.607
- How tall was he?
- I don't know. It was dark.

14:41.657 --> 14:43.773
But he was wearing glasses?

14:43.817 --> 14:46.934
White man, medium height,
black-rimmed glasses.

14:47.937 --> 14:50.007
- Anything else, Detective?
- Yes.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.811
- Why didn't you call the police?
- It was so awful.

14:53.857 --> 14:56.451
You have no idea how awful it was.

14:58.617 --> 15:00.448
Thank you for coming.

15:01.257 --> 15:05.569
- Her story check out?
- She says it was a sneak attack.

15:05.617 --> 15:09.690
Consistent with the medical exam,
one shot from outside the car.

15:09.737 --> 15:12.490
- Other than that, it's her word...
- Against ours.

15:12.537 --> 15:17.053
Those were not wagon trains circled
around Stephanie. Those were tanks.

15:17.097 --> 15:20.009
- Did she see the shooter?
- Good enough to do a composite.

15:20.057 --> 15:22.855
- OK, did they have sex?
- Stephanie implied no.

15:22.897 --> 15:25.650
- Does no mean yes?
- They are a family of politicians.

15:25.697 --> 15:28.530
- As in liars.
- Let's get an order for a DNA swab.

15:28.577 --> 15:32.934
- What for? She says she was in the car.
- One Police Plaza all over you?

15:32.977 --> 15:35.445
Sympathy for the Mulroney family
runs high.

15:36.457 --> 15:40.132
OK, she was in the car.
What about outside motives?

15:40.177 --> 15:44.409
- Women, lots and lots of women.
- Then there's gonna be jealousy.

15:44.457 --> 15:48.166
Ex-wife lives upstate.
Woman he betrayed the most.

15:48.217 --> 15:51.175
That many women, must be boyfriends.
Check 'em out.

15:51.217 --> 15:53.731
- Munch, Jeffries, ballistics.
- You got it.

15:54.977 --> 15:57.810
- Black Talon.
- He was shot with a Black Talon?

15:57.857 --> 16:02.294
- Cop killers. Not made since 1994.
- Cos they killed too many cops.

16:02.337 --> 16:05.090
The real reason was
it was instantly recognisable.

16:05.137 --> 16:07.093
Bullet-makers want anonymity.

16:07.137 --> 16:10.413
If you can't prove where a bullet
was made, you can't sue.

16:10.457 --> 16:13.654
- Where would we be without lawyers?
- Thanks.

16:15.497 --> 16:18.057
The last straw was a sophomore

16:18.097 --> 16:20.531
who stopped by to return Dean's books.

16:21.537 --> 16:23.528
Some Greek philosophy.

16:25.537 --> 16:28.256
- As if.
- Are you still angry?

16:29.257 --> 16:31.817
Not really.

16:31.857 --> 16:35.293
Dean's dad worked in the lumberyard.
Drove a skip-lader.

16:35.337 --> 16:39.250
The kid helped out.
Before long, he was running the office.

16:39.297 --> 16:43.006
- Sounds like quite a schmoozer.
- Everything was a transaction.

16:43.057 --> 16:46.049
Sales, where to go to dinner,
what movie to see.

16:46.097 --> 16:49.248
But none of it was good enough
for the old man.

16:49.297 --> 16:53.256
I think that's why
Dean chased so many women.

16:53.297 --> 16:55.765
It wasn't hard for him to meet college girls?

16:55.817 --> 16:58.047
Hard wasn't Dean's problem.

16:59.057 --> 17:02.652
- Before the college went co-ed...
- A lot of girls.

17:02.697 --> 17:04.688
A lot of transactions.

17:07.057 --> 17:10.935
We were one of the first colleges
to regulate intimacy.

17:10.977 --> 17:14.571
- Make-out rules?
- Date rape happens on every campus.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.814
We hoped these rules
would stop it from happening.

17:17.857 --> 17:20.290
Then they turned into some sort of PC joke.

17:20.337 --> 17:24.012
- Dean was involved in date rapes?
- That's the whole point.

17:24.057 --> 17:28.289
Earlier generations would have
admired him for being a lady's man.

17:28.337 --> 17:32.967
Lady-killer, Lothario, only recently
have those terms become pejorative.

17:33.017 --> 17:35.451
So, none of his partners ever complained?

17:35.497 --> 17:37.931
Well, there were always rumours but...

17:37.977 --> 17:41.811
Look, we have many prominent
families among our alumni.

17:41.857 --> 17:45.008
They consider discretion
the better part of valour.

17:45.057 --> 17:47.491
The Mulroney family's notoriously discreet.

17:47.537 --> 17:49.971
We know that Stephanie dropped out.

17:50.017 --> 17:53.453
- Did Dean Woodruff factor into that?
- I'd rather not say.

17:53.497 --> 17:56.853
- Look, this is very awkward...
- Why don't we stop the crap?

17:56.897 --> 18:00.890
Was there a rumour of a sexual nature
between Stephanie and Dean?

18:02.377 --> 18:04.732
She came to me and cried rape.

18:04.777 --> 18:07.211
- Mm-hm.
- But the story never added up.

18:07.257 --> 18:11.648
He seduced her. He treated her shabbily.
No more, no less.

18:11.697 --> 18:14.257
So, she's a pathological liar, or what?

18:14.297 --> 18:16.288
She was a bright girl.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.846
- The burden was too much for her.
- What burden?

18:20.897 --> 18:23.286
The burden of being a Mulroney.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.609
Based on your brief description
of the assailant,

18:27.657 --> 18:30.012
we have this preliminary composite.

18:31.097 --> 18:32.769
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

18:32.817 --> 18:35.411
- It's him.
- You don't want to change anything?

18:35.457 --> 18:39.530
Excuse me, Detective, just what
part of 'yes' don't you understand?

18:39.577 --> 18:41.533
The part about Barrett College.

18:41.577 --> 18:44.535
Miss Mulroney, when you asked her

18:44.577 --> 18:48.331
if she met Dean Woodruff in Le Bar
the night of the incident,

18:48.377 --> 18:50.413
nodded in the affirmative.

18:50.457 --> 18:52.971
But she actually met him
in her sophomore year.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.566
- She knew him.
- Intimately, we were told.

18:55.617 --> 18:58.290
- That wasn't the question.
- But it is now.

18:58.337 --> 19:01.852
- I ran into him at the bar, OK?
- That's enough.

19:01.897 --> 19:05.685
Captain Cragen,
we all want the same thing here.

19:05.737 --> 19:08.046
- Yes, ma'am, the truth.
- Well said.

19:08.097 --> 19:12.727
Are you making an identification
or a martyr out of my daughter?

19:12.777 --> 19:15.575
This family really doesn't need
any more martyrs.

19:21.057 --> 19:23.491
The Nuclear Medicine Wing
at Bronx General.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.290
Mulroney Chair in Public Policy
at the New School.

19:26.337 --> 19:30.330
And paying for the restoration
of half the structures in the park.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.210
My God, Senator Mulroney
was instrumental

19:33.257 --> 19:36.169
in getting sex-crime legislation
passed in the Senate.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.173
For which we're eternally grateful.

19:38.217 --> 19:41.414
Don't be facetious.
We're up against some very big guns.

19:41.457 --> 19:46.053
I've met the matriarch and lawyer.
Adam, this girl's story is a mess.

19:46.097 --> 19:50.249
She was in shock.
What's the motive, by the way?

19:50.297 --> 19:52.492
She was involved with the victim.

19:52.537 --> 19:56.166
Now, maybe he date-raped her.
Maybe he just forgot to call.

19:56.217 --> 20:00.608
Either way, she was mortified.
We think she stewed for years...

20:00.657 --> 20:02.249
You think?

20:02.297 --> 20:05.289
She ran into him,
allowed herself to be picked up...

20:05.337 --> 20:10.286
So, she could neck him, jump out
and shoot him, while he sat still?

20:10.337 --> 20:14.694
This girl is no stranger to trouble.
She's been arrested for cocaine.

20:14.737 --> 20:17.854
Possession. This is murder, for God's sake.

20:17.897 --> 20:20.047
Find the weapon, make the case.

20:20.097 --> 20:24.329
We have a case!
We have motive. We have opportunity.

20:24.377 --> 20:27.289
What about means? Where's the gun?

20:27.337 --> 20:30.135
Maybe in the Hudson River.
Maybe the East River.

20:32.137 --> 20:34.093
Sir, all due respect,

20:34.137 --> 20:38.608
90 per cent of murderers you put in Attica
are there without a murder weapon.

20:38.657 --> 20:40.648
Talk to McCoy.

20:42.337 --> 20:43.736
Thank you.

20:49.297 --> 20:51.970
Cocaine users are prone
to distorting the truth.

20:52.017 --> 20:54.770
She lied to us
about when she met the victim.

20:54.817 --> 20:58.696
She lied about her trauma
so Mommy could put her on ice.

20:58.737 --> 21:01.046
Hail, Regina, Queen of the Mulroney clan.

21:01.097 --> 21:03.372
I've had it up to here with these people.

21:03.417 --> 21:06.489
- What about the shooter composite?
- What about it?

21:06.537 --> 21:09.290
Well, it's based on her eyewitness account.

21:09.337 --> 21:11.897
- Where does that leave you?
- With her.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.292
We think she's the shooter.

21:16.137 --> 21:18.412
Like I told Schiff, motive, opportunity.

21:18.457 --> 21:22.814
She told us she was changing
the radio station when the guy appeared.

21:22.857 --> 21:25.166
She can't remember what song was playing.

21:25.217 --> 21:29.096
You change the radio station
when something annoys you.

21:29.137 --> 21:31.173
She's zooming us, Jack.

21:33.777 --> 21:37.167
A.44's a big gun.

21:37.217 --> 21:41.096
The whole idea of her shooting him
from behind begs credulity.

21:41.137 --> 21:43.605
She didn't have to pull the trigger.

21:44.657 --> 21:48.616
I'll have to deal with damage control
with Schiff and the press

21:48.657 --> 21:51.091
and security after the arraignment.

21:51.137 --> 21:54.493
These are powerful people.
They are magnets for weirdos.

21:54.537 --> 21:56.892
You're going for it?

21:58.777 --> 22:01.052
Making false statements.

22:01.097 --> 22:04.169
Luring a guy to his death for revenge.

22:05.177 --> 22:07.133
We'll go murder two.

22:07.177 --> 22:09.452
Then we'll flip her on the shooter.

22:12.977 --> 22:15.332
Docket number 99467.

22:15.377 --> 22:18.494
The people of the state of New York
v Stephanie Mulroney.

22:18.537 --> 22:21.005
The charge is second-degree murder.

22:22.057 --> 22:25.732
- How do you plead?
- Your Honour. Before she answers,

22:25.777 --> 22:28.735
I'd like to ask the court
to remove the restraints.

22:28.777 --> 22:31.132
Please, out of respect.

22:31.177 --> 22:33.566
As a gentleman, I'll agree.

22:47.737 --> 22:50.012
My client pleads not guilty.

22:50.057 --> 22:53.094
- I assume the People ask for bail.
- We ask for remand.

22:53.137 --> 22:54.889
You're joking.

22:54.937 --> 22:59.249
The defendant's family obtained
an expedited passport for her.

22:59.297 --> 23:02.573
Also, she has unlimited financial resources.

23:02.617 --> 23:05.177
I think we're all aware of that,
Miss Carmichael.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.777
Therefore we see her
as a serious flight risk.

23:07.817 --> 23:10.809
- Your Honour, this is incredible.
- I agree.

23:11.817 --> 23:14.092
I find it incredible

23:14.137 --> 23:18.335
that this woman has so lowered
the standards by which she was raised.

23:18.377 --> 23:21.255
I believe she might
put herself above the law.

23:21.297 --> 23:25.927
I don't intend to have Miss Mulroney
gallivanting around Europe.

23:25.977 --> 23:27.968
Not on my court's record.

23:28.977 --> 23:32.970
Bail is denied. Remand the defendant
to the Department of Corrections.

23:36.217 --> 23:38.777
Were you surprised at the judge's decision?

23:38.817 --> 23:41.570
Staggered. It's simply beyond me how...

23:41.617 --> 23:43.573
I'm sorry, I can't...

23:43.617 --> 23:47.371
Judge Abrams' decision to remand
was simply wrong-headed.

23:47.417 --> 23:52.013
The assertion that Miss Mulroney
was a risk for flight is ludicrous.

23:52.057 --> 23:56.096
The fact is the Mulroneys have
planned a family reunion in Bermuda.

23:56.137 --> 23:59.573
I expect that Stephanie
will be part of that celebration,

23:59.617 --> 24:02.609
as soon as the judge's decision
is reviewed by his peers.

24:02.657 --> 24:06.013
Judge Abrams is a conservative
Republican. Was that a factor?

24:06.057 --> 24:08.651
You said that. I didn't.
You'll have to ask him.

24:10.337 --> 24:12.612
- Any response to that?
- To what?

24:12.657 --> 24:16.127
That holding Miss Mulroney without bail
is totally ridiculous.

24:16.177 --> 24:18.816
That family is used to getting its way.

24:18.857 --> 24:21.929
Are you saying
they get preferential treatment?

24:21.977 --> 24:23.126
Oh, come on.

24:23.177 --> 24:26.647
They deserve all due process of the law.
No more, no less.

24:27.457 --> 24:29.413
I hope to God we're right on this.

24:29.457 --> 24:32.415
I hear Logan's learning
to love Staten Island.

24:32.457 --> 24:36.211
If you have any knowledge of this handgun,
please call Olivia Benson

24:36.257 --> 24:40.694
at the Special Victims Unit, 212-555-0156.

24:40.737 --> 24:44.571
Not a magnum, no.
It was used in a homicide in New York City.

24:44.617 --> 24:47.370
I know there's no federal gun registry.

24:47.417 --> 24:51.410
But surely we can cross-reference
New York State with your files?

24:52.417 --> 24:54.885
Yes, surprise, surprise. A single bullet.

24:54.937 --> 24:58.452
In the vicinity of the 1-7? When?
Oh, boy. Captain!

24:58.497 --> 25:00.852
- Yeah.
- It's the duty captain at the 1-7.

25:00.897 --> 25:03.616
Another shooting, .44 calibre,
back of the head.

25:03.657 --> 25:05.773
- Parked car?
- Pants down.

25:08.817 --> 25:12.173
Oh, this looks familiar.
Déjà vu all over again.

25:12.217 --> 25:14.651
The guy never knew what hit him. One shot.

25:14.697 --> 25:18.451
- Who's got the spent round?
- I dug it out of the visor.

25:18.497 --> 25:21.250
- Those bits of shattered glass?
- The vanity mirror.

25:21.297 --> 25:25.575
- Vanity, thy name is woman.
- Frailty, not vanity, misogynist.

25:25.617 --> 25:28.529
- Artist formerly known as?
- Prince's old girlfriend.

25:28.577 --> 25:31.489
Life! One minute,
getting your door knob polished,

25:31.537 --> 25:34.097
the next you're sweet-talking Saint Peter.

25:34.137 --> 25:36.651
- You got an ID?
- Car belongs to Stanley Brecker.

25:36.697 --> 25:39.575
- Is that his wife?
- Her name's not Brecker.

25:39.617 --> 25:41.573
Er, Catfish.

25:41.617 --> 25:44.290
Katish, K-A-T-l-S-H.

25:46.457 --> 25:49.017
Excuse me, Miss Katish.
How are you doing?

25:49.057 --> 25:51.013
Not that hot.

25:51.057 --> 25:54.129
I never thought I'd be part
of something like this.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.372
Something like what?

25:57.377 --> 26:00.813
You know... All of this. That.

26:01.817 --> 26:05.605
That guy died while I... You know.

26:05.657 --> 26:09.570
Oh! So, you didn't get a good look at him?
Did you get a peek maybe?

26:09.617 --> 26:12.177
I remember his eyes. Bright and shiny.

26:12.217 --> 26:15.653
- With those Buddy Holly glasses.
- What, black?

26:15.697 --> 26:18.973
Yeah. Like a little psychotic nerd.

26:19.017 --> 26:22.009
That's a good description.
What do you do, Miss Katish?

26:22.057 --> 26:24.013
Erm...

26:24.057 --> 26:27.413
I model. And temp work.

26:27.457 --> 26:31.052
And I auditioned for Picnic this week.

26:32.057 --> 26:36.096
We met in a bar
and he seemed like a nice guy.

26:41.657 --> 26:43.613
Can I get you anything, Mrs Brecker?

26:43.657 --> 26:47.445
Was it a car-jacking gone wrong
or something?

26:49.697 --> 26:52.211
We're not sure.

26:52.257 --> 26:54.009
Shot.

26:54.057 --> 26:57.652
I always thought heart attack
or stroke from the pressure.

26:58.457 --> 27:01.051
- Business pressure?
- The garment business.

27:01.097 --> 27:03.213
It's unbelievably cut-throat.

27:03.257 --> 27:06.374
Stanley loved it but I always worried.

27:06.417 --> 27:09.693
If it wasn't some union organiser
pressuring him,

27:09.737 --> 27:13.810
it was some goon after protection money,
and it never ended.

27:15.817 --> 27:17.808
Well, I guess it has.

27:19.777 --> 27:23.736
Ballistics is still working
to see if the two slugs are twins.

27:23.777 --> 27:27.656
- Follow the bullet. Unbelievable.
- Maybe it's a copycat.

27:27.697 --> 27:30.814
That would be good, unlikely but good.
Weapon?

27:30.857 --> 27:34.247
Uniforms are freezing their asses
in the park having zero luck.

27:34.297 --> 27:36.253
What about the Mulroney chick?

27:36.297 --> 27:38.652
The arrest that's gonna end my career?

27:38.697 --> 27:41.609
It puts a damper on
the 'Hell hath no fury' theory.

27:41.657 --> 27:45.047
Have you got any conspiracy theories
to replace it?

27:47.057 --> 27:50.015
- How's the wife?
- Bitter but not even angry.

27:50.057 --> 27:53.174
- She didn't do it.
- So we're looking for a freak.

27:53.217 --> 27:55.685
Walks up to parked cars
and shoots the guys.

27:55.737 --> 27:57.728
A loser who never gets any himself?

28:02.097 --> 28:04.053
This thing is amazing.

28:04.097 --> 28:08.090
Sometimes I put in the features
of my perfect woman.

28:08.137 --> 28:10.093
Like this?

28:10.137 --> 28:13.686
No, rounder.
And the hair was parted on the left.

28:13.737 --> 28:16.331
It wasn't really parted,
it was brushed back.

28:17.337 --> 28:19.293
Like that?

28:19.337 --> 28:21.487
Yeah, like that.

28:22.537 --> 28:25.210
Captain, I went back 30 years.

28:25.257 --> 28:28.169
319 shootings with a.44
excluding Magnums.

28:28.217 --> 28:30.606
- How many from intermediate range?
- 12.

28:30.657 --> 28:34.013
Some unrelated, a domestic,
a drunken New Year's Eve.

28:34.057 --> 28:36.730
- Plus three from parked cars.
- Any arrests?

28:36.777 --> 28:41.009
Yeah. Two shootings. A guy named Barnes.
Died in the Attica riot.

28:41.057 --> 28:44.094
- What about open cases?
- Four of them, six years ago.

28:44.137 --> 28:48.130
One from the 2-7. In three others,
the slugs were from the same gun.

28:53.057 --> 28:55.969
This is Captain Donald Cragen,
Special Victims Unit.

28:56.017 --> 28:58.451
Is Detective Lennie Briscoe there, please?

28:58.497 --> 29:00.533
Hey, Lennie. Don.

29:00.577 --> 29:04.331
Listen, didn't we have an unsolved 93-94?

29:04.377 --> 29:06.937
Guy whacked in a parked car
with a.44.

29:06.977 --> 29:10.811
There was this annoying
old homeless lady and a lot of snow.

29:10.857 --> 29:14.088
Logan and I froze our asses off, I remember.

29:14.137 --> 29:17.573
- How about the guy in the car?
- Stiff but not from the cold.

29:17.617 --> 29:22.566
We never found the weapon,
just a description of a guy with glasses.

29:22.617 --> 29:24.972
Black, like Buddy Holly?

29:27.017 --> 29:29.326
Yeah, black, like Buddy Holly.

29:31.217 --> 29:33.572
Fashions change, clothes, hair, glasses.

29:33.617 --> 29:37.576
We arrested the wrong guy.
It was just one of those days all around.

29:37.617 --> 29:41.610
The only description we had was
from one witness, Jill Templeton.

29:43.177 --> 29:46.055
- This guy's back?
- With two more hits under his belt.

29:52.657 --> 29:55.330
- Bad time, Captain?
- Oh, no.

29:55.377 --> 29:58.130
I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

29:58.177 --> 30:00.293
Yeah. It's a size.44.

30:00.337 --> 30:04.250
- The same gun, the same shooter.
- Not the Mulroney girl.

30:04.297 --> 30:07.414
- No.
- OK, tell me something good.

30:07.457 --> 30:11.416
I spoke to the owner of a gun shop
in Jersey who sold Black Talons.

30:11.457 --> 30:14.096
He remembers a guy with black glasses.

30:16.697 --> 30:18.972
Well, that's something.

30:19.017 --> 30:21.406
Five years ago, a guy came in and browsed.

30:21.457 --> 30:24.733
I never would've have noticed him
but he pissed me off.

30:24.777 --> 30:28.053
Did he denounce the John Birch Society
as being soft on Y2K?

30:28.097 --> 30:30.657
No, he kept dry-firing my hunting rifles.

30:30.697 --> 30:35.054
I told him to buy something
or get his sorry ass out.

30:35.097 --> 30:38.806
- So he bought some Black Talons?
- Said he wanted some cop-killers.

30:38.857 --> 30:42.896
And as a law-abiding
constitutional constructionist,

30:42.937 --> 30:46.452
- you sold them to him.
- It's still a free country.

30:46.497 --> 30:49.136
Could we look at those records?

30:49.177 --> 30:52.772
I'm against government interference
in free enterprise.

30:52.817 --> 30:56.890
Yeah, so am I. That's why I consider
a court order an intrusion,

30:56.937 --> 30:59.087
although sometimes a necessary one.

31:02.217 --> 31:03.855
OK.

31:11.057 --> 31:14.572
'Arthur Prewitt. December 4th, 1994.

31:14.617 --> 31:18.212
'Three boxes of Black Talons, .44 calibre.'

31:19.337 --> 31:23.933
We've got five priors on your man Prewitt,
cheque kiting, forgery...

31:23.977 --> 31:26.013
Was there a weapon involved?

31:26.057 --> 31:28.890
Yes, please. I'm on hold with the Feebs.

31:28.937 --> 31:33.215
He was busted with a hundred credit cards
out at some Indian bingo casino.

31:33.257 --> 31:37.091
The desert will get you every time.
Meth-crazed bikers and scorpions.

31:37.137 --> 31:40.254
- Land of fruit and nuts.
- Released five months ago.

31:40.297 --> 31:44.449
Told his PO his mother was dying.
Address is a flophouse in Chinatown.

31:44.497 --> 31:48.456
I'll call the 2-7.
It's their bust, too. Get rolling.

31:49.657 --> 31:53.252
We're looking for one of your guests.
A man named Prewitt.

32:00.617 --> 32:02.528
Are you Arthur Prewitt?

32:04.297 --> 32:08.051
- Who are you?
- Detective Benson.

32:08.097 --> 32:10.167
You got some ID?

32:11.577 --> 32:13.568
Yes, I do.

32:29.177 --> 32:31.452
I'm the man you're looking for.

32:57.217 --> 32:59.572
- Number three.
- Are you sure?

32:59.617 --> 33:02.609
Yeah. It was dark, but it wasn't that dark.

33:02.657 --> 33:05.217
I'll remember him till the day I die.

33:05.257 --> 33:08.329
- That face, those glasses.
- It's not an audition.

33:08.377 --> 33:09.969
Just... are you sure?

33:10.977 --> 33:13.332
All right. How's this?

33:13.377 --> 33:16.494
And the winner is... number three!

33:16.537 --> 33:19.609
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

33:20.617 --> 33:22.414
Next.

33:24.657 --> 33:28.616
I know it's been a little while,
Miss Templeton, so take a look...

33:28.657 --> 33:31.694
- Number three.
- Are you sure? Just take your time.

33:32.697 --> 33:35.530
- Number three.
- OK, thank you.

33:37.537 --> 33:39.129
All right.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.448
Number three.

33:53.537 --> 33:56.415
- It's Prewitt.
- 'Hey, man.

33:56.457 --> 33:59.415
'I wasn't even there.
I was a patrolman then.

33:59.457 --> 34:01.812
'I still hadn't seen my first stiff.

34:01.857 --> 34:04.974
But when I saw
those crime scene photos.

34:05.017 --> 34:08.168
I almost blew my lunch.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.931
Tuna salad on wheat

34:12.976 --> 34:16.333
and one of those three-dollar bottles
of crappuccino.

34:16.377 --> 34:21.496
Me and my partner at the time,
we were cold for days, weeks,

34:21.536 --> 34:24.097
down by the sea wall.

34:24.137 --> 34:28.255
The wind coming in off the Atlantic
and the wet snow.

34:29.016 --> 34:32.327
It got in your hair, along with that smell.

34:34.737 --> 34:37.126
You know that smell I'm talking about?

34:38.456 --> 34:41.369
Wet wool. I know.

34:42.456 --> 34:44.572
The smell of death, Arthur.

34:45.577 --> 34:47.806
It never leaves you. Never.

34:49.417 --> 34:51.851
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

34:51.897 --> 34:55.446
All these guys trying to get you
to give us a crumb of information.

34:55.496 --> 34:58.136
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it's the high point of my life.

34:58.177 --> 35:02.056
Better than shooting those people,
you little reptilian geek?

35:03.537 --> 35:06.927
- Oh, it's bad cop now, right?
- You bet your ass!

35:06.977 --> 35:08.012
John, easy.

35:08.057 --> 35:11.686
- You did it, you piece of crap.
- Seriously, come on.

35:11.737 --> 35:15.207
- I'm gonna kill this guy myself!
- Call him off.

35:15.257 --> 35:19.489
- I'll Mike Tyson you, you bastard!
- Come on. Is this legal?

35:19.537 --> 35:21.368
Probably not.

35:21.417 --> 35:26.013
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you.

35:26.057 --> 35:28.048
Let's talk about the working stiff.

35:29.657 --> 35:31.648
- Who?
- Dean Woodruff.

35:34.537 --> 35:37.256
- You already asked me about him.
- I'm asking again.

35:37.297 --> 35:41.210
The path in the park.
You're hiding in the tunnel. They drive by...

35:41.257 --> 35:43.612
You've got a vivid imagination.

35:43.657 --> 35:47.366
- Is that all you've got?
- And the Black Talons you bought.

35:47.417 --> 35:50.966
Like I'm the only person in New York
who bought Black Talons?

35:51.017 --> 35:53.008
Three witnesses.

35:54.057 --> 35:56.287
Who saw what?

35:56.337 --> 35:58.532
It was pitch-black.

35:59.537 --> 36:04.167
The windows were fogging up because
the people inside were getting busy.

36:04.217 --> 36:05.570
So, you were there?

36:08.097 --> 36:09.325
No.

36:11.777 --> 36:13.768
I've just got a vivid imagination.

36:17.377 --> 36:19.368
Three different witnesses, Prewitt.

36:20.377 --> 36:21.446
Uh-uh.

36:22.657 --> 36:25.455
Confess. Maybe you won't end up...

36:26.457 --> 36:28.766
you know where.

36:30.977 --> 36:33.491
We saw your handiwork. It was...

36:33.537 --> 36:36.847
- It was awesome. It was...
- Professional. One shot, boom.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.652
And then you leave the girl alone.

36:43.257 --> 36:45.248
You left the girl alone.

36:46.297 --> 36:47.696
That was...

36:49.937 --> 36:51.814
Gentlemanly.

36:51.857 --> 36:55.930
The very word I was looking for.
You are a gentleman of the old school.

37:04.417 --> 37:06.328
So that's a yes.

37:13.857 --> 37:15.654
Under coercion...

37:17.697 --> 37:19.494
that's a yes.

37:26.817 --> 37:28.614
Well, that's that.

37:29.657 --> 37:32.091
- Prewitt confessed.
- To killing Woodruff?

37:32.137 --> 37:36.096
That's the good news. The bad news
is Schiffs gonna ream me a new one.

37:36.137 --> 37:38.367
- Maybe not.
- Meaning?

37:38.417 --> 37:42.615
This guy stonewalls us,
then flips like an eel. What's his agenda?

37:42.657 --> 37:44.727
I'm damned if I know, John.

37:49.177 --> 37:52.214
This shooting's remarkably
similar to the first.

37:52.257 --> 37:56.091
COD from a.44. Same point of entry.
Same trajectory.

37:56.137 --> 37:58.697
And given the lack of any powder tattoos,

37:58.737 --> 38:01.297
I'd say the shooter
was at least a few feet away.

38:01.337 --> 38:03.692
But there is one significant difference.

38:03.737 --> 38:06.012
Tell me what you see.

38:06.057 --> 38:09.811
A beautiful woman who hasn't been
in a nice restaurant in months.

38:09.857 --> 38:11.927
Ruptured blood vessels.

38:12.937 --> 38:14.893
Mild skin discoloration.

38:14.937 --> 38:17.007
These bruises are a few weeks old.

38:17.057 --> 38:19.013
There's similar bruising on the jaw.

38:19.057 --> 38:23.414
- So he had previous injuries.
- My guess is from a fist fight.

38:23.457 --> 38:26.813
Are you talking polite fisticuffs
or brass knuckles?

38:26.857 --> 38:28.813
Somebody beat the crap out of him.

38:28.857 --> 38:30.848
Will you ever have dinner with me?

38:31.857 --> 38:33.848
Not while I can still feed myself.

38:36.297 --> 38:39.972
I'm only sorry we had to involve
everyone in this wild-goose chase.

38:40.017 --> 38:42.531
I'm not sure it was so wild.

38:43.537 --> 38:45.892
Is the investigation still open?

38:45.937 --> 38:48.167
No, sir, not any more.

38:48.217 --> 38:50.811
The public has deified the Mulroneys.

38:50.857 --> 38:53.212
They've done a lot to deserve that.

38:53.257 --> 38:55.817
That entitlement doesn't extend to the law.

38:55.857 --> 38:57.654
Well, it does.

38:59.057 --> 39:01.651
And someone is going
to have to fall on his sword.

39:04.137 --> 39:06.810
It'll be painless.

39:06.857 --> 39:08.813
Yes, come in.

39:08.857 --> 39:11.929
- Good afternoon, Adam.
- Welcome.

39:12.937 --> 39:16.009
We all know each other.
Please, sit down.

39:16.057 --> 39:21.575
I asked Judge McEvoy
to dismiss in chambers, without prejudice,

39:21.617 --> 39:24.734
to spare any further public embarrassment.

39:24.777 --> 39:26.768
I appreciate the gesture, Adam.

39:26.817 --> 39:30.287
God knows, we'll always
be grist to the tabloids.

39:30.337 --> 39:33.886
People are always quick
to jump to the wrong conclusion.

39:33.937 --> 39:36.451
From some youthful indiscretion,

39:36.497 --> 39:38.647
to this trumped-up mess.

39:38.697 --> 39:42.531
- Have you heard from Judge Abrams?
- He heard from me.

39:42.577 --> 39:44.568
I guess that's my cue.

39:46.177 --> 39:49.294
- I was wrong, Miss Mulroney.
- All right.

39:50.337 --> 39:53.568
Please accept my apologies to your family.

39:53.617 --> 39:56.211
Thank you, Captain.
You seem like a nice man.

40:05.497 --> 40:07.852
Captain, I just came from the ME's.

40:07.897 --> 40:09.808
She has some doubts about Brecker.

40:09.857 --> 40:12.417
What is this, another magic bullet theory?

40:12.457 --> 40:14.891
Somebody worked him over pretty good.

40:14.937 --> 40:17.974
- A soft guy, not an amateur boxer.
- I'm not following you.

40:18.017 --> 40:20.577
He was in the garment trade,
like my grandfather.

40:20.617 --> 40:24.007
He always said, 'Behind every
tailor's dummy is a Gambino.'

40:24.057 --> 40:25.854
Where are you going with this?

40:25.897 --> 40:29.446
The victim was in the garment trade.
His wife said he was a family man.

40:29.497 --> 40:32.933
But he was shot in mid oral cop
with some actress, model, whatever,

40:32.977 --> 40:36.208
a euphemism for employee of the month
in the porno business.

40:36.257 --> 40:38.293
- John!
- The wife also told Benson

40:38.337 --> 40:40.771
that her husband got shaken down

40:40.817 --> 40:43.570
by two bull-necked boys in leather jackets.

40:43.617 --> 40:47.815
Schmutters and porno, Captain.
Does the word racketeering come to mind?

40:48.857 --> 40:53.567
- So this isn't a serial killer?
- It's all too neat. All too simple.

40:53.617 --> 40:58.168
Stephanie Mulroney killed Woodruff.
I know it. I feel it.

40:59.817 --> 41:03.173
I'm not gonna tell anyone
we've had this conversation.

41:03.217 --> 41:06.971
The Mulroneys can crush
any of us like bugs.

41:07.017 --> 41:10.692
They'll do whatever it takes
to protect the family. Trust me!
