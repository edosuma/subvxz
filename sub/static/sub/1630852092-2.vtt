00:04.070 --> 00:05.670
[Julian] <i>When I look in
the mirror, I feel disgusted.</i>

00:05.672 --> 00:09.274
<i>I mean, why would you get this way,
you know, look what you've become.</i>

00:16.249 --> 00:19.418
Please! Just a little
glimmer of hope.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.987
<i>I just want to be
a normal person.</i>

00:21.989 --> 00:25.424
[breathing heavily]

00:32.766 --> 00:36.101
You can't do it and then
I just get mad.

00:36.103 --> 00:39.371
<i>If I don't make a change now,
I'm scared it's gonna be too late.</i>

00:43.376 --> 00:46.645
[groaning] No! It hurts!

00:46.647 --> 00:51.283
<i>I refuse to stop fighting. I
have to do this for my children.</i>

00:56.923 --> 00:58.724
<i>[Julian] It's basically
my nightmare.</i>

00:58.726 --> 01:00.192
<i>It's a pinche tornado.</i>

01:00.194 --> 01:04.229
- Baby, we can't take all the boxes.
- We have to!

01:30.623 --> 01:32.291
[Julian exhales]

01:40.834 --> 01:44.303
<i>[Julian] My life has been
seriously impacted</i>

01:44.305 --> 01:47.206
<i>because of how high
my weight is now.</i>

01:50.110 --> 01:53.378
<i>With how big I am, it's
hard to do much of anything.</i>

02:02.856 --> 02:04.857
<i>With all the weight
that's just on my legs,</i>

02:04.859 --> 02:08.193
<i>each step I take
is painful for me now.</i>

02:12.899 --> 02:15.734
<i>So I have to go slow
to manage them.</i>

02:15.736 --> 02:17.436
<i>So that I don't get
out of breath.</i>

02:17.438 --> 02:20.372
<i>Because that can lead me
to passing out.</i>

02:25.411 --> 02:29.515
<i>So my breathing is limited. So I
have to be careful to just do anything.</i>

02:29.517 --> 02:33.552
<i>So I only get up
for limited things really.</i>

02:33.554 --> 02:37.456
<i>The main one being to cook.
That's one of my passions.</i>

02:37.458 --> 02:40.092
<i>And it's something I'm good at.</i>

02:41.528 --> 02:45.430
<i>So, usually what I do when I first
get up is make breakfast with my wife.</i>

02:47.934 --> 02:50.335
<i>[Irma] Julian's probably
the best cook I know.</i>

02:52.005 --> 02:55.841
<i>I mean, I love everything
he makes for me.</i>

02:55.843 --> 03:00.045
But I would have to say that my
favorite meal that Julian cooks for me,

03:00.047 --> 03:02.548
it's salmon
when he cooks it in butter

03:02.550 --> 03:06.952
and then he makes asparagus
next to it and brussels sprouts

03:08.021 --> 03:11.056
<i>[Irma] He's very good at
making meals that taste good.</i>

03:11.925 --> 03:14.960
<i>But getting more worried
about him.</i>

03:15.662 --> 03:18.096
<i>So I do want him to eat better.</i>

03:18.098 --> 03:22.334
<i>But the dynamic right now is
that he makes whatever he wants</i>

03:22.336 --> 03:24.269
<i>and that's what we eat.</i>

03:27.540 --> 03:30.275
<i>[Julian] Me and Irma also live
with my grandmother and my mom.</i>

03:30.277 --> 03:32.978
<i>So I also cook for them
at times too.</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:37.015
<i>But I mostly cook for Irma.
Because we're always together.</i>

03:39.619 --> 03:42.487
I wait until around 12 o'clock
to eat lunch

03:42.489 --> 03:45.490
<i>and then
I'll snack until dinner.</i>

03:45.492 --> 03:49.628
<i>But I feel the best meal of
each day is usually the first.</i>

03:49.630 --> 03:53.832
<i>Once I have that ready, I
have a lot of excitement about it.</i>

03:53.834 --> 03:57.536
<i>Because it's something that brings
me great pleasure and happiness.</i>

03:57.538 --> 04:00.272
<i>Eating is a big joy to me
in my life.</i>

04:00.274 --> 04:03.742
<i>Because it's a time
when nothing bad can touch me.</i>

04:03.744 --> 04:09.848
<i>Eating makes me feel better, so there's no
moment in my day when I'm not wanting that.</i>

04:09.850 --> 04:12.584
<i>And eating is an activity
I do most of the day now.</i>

04:12.586 --> 04:17.022
<i>So, food has a central point
in my life and it's what I follow.</i>

04:17.024 --> 04:20.125
<i>And I know it's what led
me to decide that I am now.</i>

04:22.462 --> 04:23.595
Oh, that was good.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.098
- All right, you want to take the plate?
- Yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.502
<i>[Julian] But even knowing that
hasn't slowed my eating down.</i>

04:30.504 --> 04:32.604
<i>But I know I need to somehow.</i>

04:32.606 --> 04:36.441
<i>Because how difficult it is
now to do the things I need.</i>

04:36.443 --> 04:41.146
<i>But I try to do all that I can
on my own still, you know.</i>

04:41.148 --> 04:45.117
<i>Because it makes me feel less of
a man when Irma has to help me.</i>

04:45.652 --> 04:47.152
[Julian exhales] Okay.

04:47.387 --> 04:52.424
<i>[Irma] Julian has gotten to a point
where I have to help him in ways</i>

04:52.426 --> 04:55.193
<i>that I know he wishes I didn't.</i>

04:55.195 --> 04:57.329
I'll call you when I am
ready for you to do my back.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.997
I'll come.

04:58.999 --> 05:03.201
<i>[Irma] Like, with showering
and then if he uses the restroom.</i>

05:03.203 --> 05:06.038
<i>I might have to help him
with that too.</i>

05:06.040 --> 05:08.740
<i>But I know that it hurts him
that I have to do that, you know.</i>

05:08.742 --> 05:10.409
[shower hisses]

05:15.615 --> 05:18.684
<i>I do think
that Julian gets embarrassed.</i>

05:18.686 --> 05:23.088
<i>On asking me to, like,
to help him wash his backside.</i>

05:24.324 --> 05:27.392
<i>Like, he does try to do
as much by himself.</i>

05:27.394 --> 05:30.062
<i>But I'm just afraid that he's
going to push himself too hard,</i>

05:30.064 --> 05:31.797
<i>and get hurt.</i>

05:31.799 --> 05:33.332
<i>That's one of my fears.</i>

05:35.001 --> 05:37.402
- Babe!
- Yeah.

05:37.404 --> 05:40.005
- Can you come clean my back?
- Yeah.

05:41.874 --> 05:44.042
[Julian] <i>I wish I can
do more on my own,</i>

05:44.044 --> 05:47.879
<i>but sometimes,
I have no choice anymore.</i>

05:47.881 --> 05:50.382
<i>And I hate that I'm like
this now with my body.</i>

05:50.384 --> 05:52.617
<i>And how I let it get like this.</i>

05:52.619 --> 05:55.387
When I look in the mirror,
I feel disgusted.

05:56.756 --> 06:00.192
I feel like, "Why would you
get this way?" You know?

06:00.194 --> 06:02.160
"Wow, look
what you've become."

06:03.463 --> 06:06.832
<i>So, food has made me
get like this.</i>

06:06.834 --> 06:10.936
<i>But it's something that's helped
me through a lot of bad in my life.</i>

06:10.938 --> 06:14.039
<i>And it's been like that
for a long time.</i>

06:15.541 --> 06:17.242
- Is that it?
- Yes.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.317
<i>[Julian] Things were good
for my early life.</i>

06:25.319 --> 06:27.886
<i>I grew up with my mom
and my two younger sisters.</i>

06:27.888 --> 06:31.757
<i>And we had the best of times
that we can make it, you know,</i>

06:31.759 --> 06:33.425
<i>growing up in Detroit, Michigan.</i>

06:34.527 --> 06:37.195
<i>My father wasn't
part of the picture.</i>

06:37.197 --> 06:40.732
<i>And so my mom had three jobs
just to put a roof over our head.</i>

06:40.734 --> 06:42.434
<i>But we didn't have a lot.</i>

06:42.436 --> 06:45.070
<i>And a lot of times,
me and my sisters</i>

06:45.072 --> 06:48.073
<i>didn't know when the next
time we was going to get food.</i>

06:49.041 --> 06:52.711
<i>So when we finally did
get food, I ate a lot of it.</i>

06:52.713 --> 06:55.380
<i>So food started to be
a comfort for me.</i>

06:55.382 --> 06:57.783
<i>Because if I had it,
I felt better.</i>

06:57.785 --> 07:03.021
<i>But I really didn't start my gaining
until my mom married my stepdad.</i>

07:03.689 --> 07:07.726
<i>He treated us nice at first,
but he was a mean person.</i>

07:07.728 --> 07:10.495
<i>Like, who he really was
started to come out.</i>

07:10.497 --> 07:14.166
<i>So it turned into a nightmare,
having him as a stepdad.</i>

07:14.168 --> 07:18.270
I think Julian, he always felt
like he was the man of the house.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.906
But then
he had to fight the battle

07:20.908 --> 07:24.876
<i>of being not the man of the house
because the husband came in.</i>

07:24.878 --> 07:27.446
<i>So they had
their little battles.</i>

07:29.315 --> 07:30.582
<i>[Julian] But I had
tolerated him.</i>

07:30.584 --> 07:33.852
<i>And one of the main ways
I knew to do that was to eat.</i>

07:33.854 --> 07:37.722
<i>And that's when my eating got
worse and I started to gain weight.</i>

07:37.724 --> 07:40.826
<i>From being around 50 to
60 pounds when I was seven,</i>

07:40.828 --> 07:43.895
<i>to being and 170 pounds
when I was 10.</i>

07:43.897 --> 07:47.332
<i>That's when I started
to stand out as "the big kid."</i>

07:47.867 --> 07:51.369
<i>So I started getting bullied
and beaten up.</i>

07:51.371 --> 07:55.674
<i>So, middle school
was a terrifying place for me.</i>

07:55.676 --> 07:59.211
<i>So I ate a lot to deal with the
bullying through middle school.</i>

07:59.213 --> 08:00.779
<i>And that just made me bigger.</i>

08:00.781 --> 08:04.349
<i>And so I was around 400
when I started high school.</i>

08:04.351 --> 08:07.419
<i>That's when things
started to change.</i>

08:07.421 --> 08:11.490
<i>Because in high school, that weight
came as an advantage in football.</i>

08:11.492 --> 08:15.393
<i>Because I was a big guy,
I was football ready.</i>

08:15.395 --> 08:19.965
<i>So when I started doing that, I
didn't get picked on or bullied as much.</i>

08:20.233 --> 08:21.800
<i>So that made school
better for me.</i>

08:21.802 --> 08:25.670
<i>And for a while, you know, they
didn't know me as that fat kid.</i>

08:25.672 --> 08:28.273
<i>They knew me as the kid
that played football.</i>

08:29.442 --> 08:31.977
<i>But my size
also helped me at home</i>

08:31.979 --> 08:35.447
<i>because things kept getting
worse at home with my stepdad.</i>

08:36.682 --> 08:40.685
<i>You know, he tried to beat me
with a bat one day when I was 17.</i>

08:40.687 --> 08:44.256
<i>That's when I realized, you
know, I was bigger to him now</i>

08:44.258 --> 08:46.291
<i>and I saw that as a positive.</i>

08:47.894 --> 08:49.728
<i>But when my mom found out,</i>

08:49.730 --> 08:53.632
<i>she said, "Well, this can't happen
and you're gonna have to go."</i>

08:53.634 --> 08:56.601
And I was like, "Oh, so
you're kicking me out for him?

08:56.603 --> 08:58.537
And he the one who's
beating me with the bat?"

08:58.539 --> 09:02.707
And she was like "No, I'm not
doing it for him, I'm doing it for you."

09:02.709 --> 09:08.113
<i>She feared for my safety at that
time, so she kicked me out of my home.</i>

09:09.515 --> 09:12.951
So then we called my grandma
and she was like, "Get him on a bus.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.686
I'll pay for it right now.
He'll stay with me."

09:14.688 --> 09:18.223
<i>And in three days,
I got to Arizona.</i>

09:19.592 --> 09:23.929
<i>I hated Arizona, and I was upset
against my mother, you know.</i>

09:23.931 --> 09:27.632
<i>Because she was the one who
caused me to lose everything.</i>

09:27.634 --> 09:32.304
<i>My school, my friends
and football.</i>

09:33.606 --> 09:37.742
<i>And it was hard for me because
I was alone and starting over.</i>

09:37.744 --> 09:42.447
But when I was eating, that's when
the hatred of Arizona went away.

09:42.449 --> 09:45.717
'Cause I was able to just eat.

09:45.719 --> 09:50.388
<i>So I've gained up to 540 by
the time I finished high school.</i>

09:50.390 --> 09:53.892
<i>But eventually, my step dad
would get arrested on a gun charge.</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:57.028
And he spent
a good three years in jail.

09:57.997 --> 10:02.100
<i>Right after that, my mom
and my sisters moved down.</i>

10:02.102 --> 10:05.770
<i>And I felt like at that time,
when I was about 20, 21,</i>

10:05.772 --> 10:07.372
<i>we started to be a family again.</i>

10:07.374 --> 10:11.209
<i>Just me, my mom
and grandma and my sisters.</i>

10:12.578 --> 10:15.780
<i>Felt a lot of responsibility
to them at that time.</i>

10:15.782 --> 10:19.384
<i>So I took it upon
myself to get into a trade.</i>

10:19.386 --> 10:23.188
<i>So I got my certification
to become an electrician.</i>

10:23.190 --> 10:26.858
<i>And I ended at the top of
my class when I graduated.</i>

10:26.860 --> 10:32.697
<i>And because of that there was a really good
electric company that was willing to hire me.</i>

10:32.732 --> 10:33.998
<i>But when they saw me,</i>

10:34.867 --> 10:38.136
they didn't offer me the
position. Because of my weight.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.407
<i>I had to take another job,
and it was a call center.</i>

10:42.409 --> 10:46.811
<i>I ended up just going
back to my old eating habits.</i>

10:46.813 --> 10:51.383
<i>So, you know, I was up to about
580 pounds over the next year.</i>

10:52.818 --> 10:57.756
<i>I was like 23 then, but I did
also want to try to meet someone.</i>

10:57.758 --> 11:00.158
<i>And I tried
to better myself for that.</i>

11:01.494 --> 11:03.395
<i>So I was starting working out.</i>

11:03.397 --> 11:05.764
<i>But the working out
led to me getting a hernia.</i>

11:05.766 --> 11:08.233
<i>So that was
another disappointment for me.</i>

11:08.235 --> 11:11.036
<i>But I didn't let that
stop me from dating.</i>

11:11.737 --> 11:16.408
<i>I did think to myself that my
weight problem could be an issue.</i>

11:16.410 --> 11:19.911
Me personally, I never thought I
would have found a wife anyway.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.012
<i>But I did.</i>

11:21.447 --> 11:24.549
And, it was the best thing
that ever happened.

11:24.551 --> 11:28.420
<i>When I found my wife,
I just knew she was the one.</i>

11:28.422 --> 11:33.391
My first thought when I met
Julian, I wanted to hug him.

11:33.393 --> 11:37.429
<i>I always tell him "I just wanted to
tell you I love you right then and there."</i>

11:37.431 --> 11:40.732
And I'm like you probably would have thought
that I was like a psycho or something.

11:40.799 --> 11:42.801
But yeah.

11:42.803 --> 11:46.037
- I'm gonna go ahead and get the grill started.
- Okay.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.710
<i>[Julian] Around that time,
I lost my job</i>

11:51.712 --> 11:54.312
<i>because they were
discriminating about my weight.</i>

11:54.314 --> 11:56.781
And I was on the verge
of losing my apartment.

11:56.783 --> 11:59.617
I had nothing to offer for
their security at that moment.

11:59.619 --> 12:03.822
<i>But I asked her to move in
with me. And she did that.</i>

12:03.824 --> 12:09.060
At the time, her grandad,
he didn't like me very much.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.729
<i>Irma was his first grandbaby.</i>

12:10.731 --> 12:14.666
<i>And you know, this new man
coming into your family.</i>

12:14.668 --> 12:17.602
<i>I can understand
his hesitation to me.</i>

12:17.604 --> 12:21.406
<i>But what I didn't understand
was when I stayed the night,</i>

12:21.408 --> 12:23.408
<i>he must have
just got pissed off,</i>

12:23.410 --> 12:26.745
and cussed me out royally
in Spanish.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.681
<i>I didn't think I did
anything wrong, so I left.</i>

12:29.683 --> 12:32.751
<i>I didn't expect her
to choose me over her family,</i>

12:32.753 --> 12:35.487
<i>but 20 minutes later, while
I'm waiting at the bus stop,</i>

12:35.489 --> 12:38.156
she comes running
right after me.

12:42.895 --> 12:46.431
<i>And she's like, "I'm going with
you. He's not about to do this."</i>

12:46.433 --> 12:49.200
That's when I knew
she was going to be my wife.

12:50.035 --> 12:51.770
<i>So we got married,</i>

12:51.772 --> 12:54.038
<i>but we couldn't have
the wedding that we wanted.</i>

12:54.040 --> 12:55.974
<i>Because of my size.</i>

12:58.077 --> 13:01.146
<i>Since then, I continued
to gain even more.</i>

13:01.148 --> 13:03.414
<i>I crossed into the 700s.</i>

13:03.416 --> 13:05.784
And I was 790.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.787
<i>So my weight has taken
every bit of my life away.</i>

13:08.789 --> 13:11.422
<i>But the biggest is that
it's keeping me and Irma</i>

13:11.424 --> 13:13.925
<i>from having a family of our own.</i>

13:13.927 --> 13:17.996
<i>You know, at my size, my chance
to have kids could pass me by.</i>

13:17.998 --> 13:19.964
<i>And that's the most
heartbreaking for me.</i>

13:19.966 --> 13:22.000
<i>So, I know
I have to lose the weight.</i>

13:22.002 --> 13:24.435
<i>But that's easier
said than done.</i>

13:27.640 --> 13:30.975
<i>My life revolves around
what I'm going to eat next.</i>

13:30.977 --> 13:32.811
<i>It's what drives me
through the day.</i>

13:32.813 --> 13:36.781
<i>But I'm getting very scared about
how much time I have left at this size.</i>

13:36.783 --> 13:39.450
<i>And I know Irma
is getting scared for me too.</i>

13:39.452 --> 13:44.589
- I checked on the potatoes, they are not done yet.
- Okay.

13:44.591 --> 13:50.528
<i>[Irma] I'm scared that I could lose
him if he doesn't do something about it.</i>

13:50.530 --> 13:55.400
I want to grow old with him. I don't
want to grow old with anybody else.

13:55.402 --> 13:59.671
<i>But I'm so scared right now
that one morning I will wake up</i>

13:59.673 --> 14:01.306
<i>and he won't.</i>

14:03.409 --> 14:06.578
<i>[Julian] I tell Irma that I want to
lose weight as much as she tells me.</i>

14:06.580 --> 14:09.247
<i>And I know she has
other fears about it.</i>

14:09.249 --> 14:12.917
<i>You know, she also scared
about me losing weight too.</i>

14:12.919 --> 14:16.287
Just to the simple fact that she thinks
I'm gonna leave her for somebody else.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.289
But I'm not.

14:21.861 --> 14:27.065
<i>[Irma] It's hard not to be afraid that things
will change if he doesn't need me anymore.</i>

14:28.334 --> 14:29.234
[Irma speaking]

14:29.236 --> 14:31.035
[Julian] I love you too.

14:33.339 --> 14:37.442
<i>[Irma] Once he loses the
weight, and I tell him that fear,</i>

14:37.444 --> 14:40.612
well, he's all like, "Babe, I
am not going to leave you."

14:40.614 --> 14:43.414
He's all like, "Just because
I get smaller does not mean

14:43.416 --> 14:48.820
that I'm not gonna wanna be with you,
like, I'm not about to do that to you."

14:48.822 --> 14:52.924
<i>[Irma] But it's still a fear,
even if it is a stupid one.</i>

14:52.926 --> 14:56.995
<i>But even if he did, you know,
I would rather him be alive.</i>

14:56.997 --> 15:01.666
So I do hope that
he is able to lose his weight.

15:01.668 --> 15:05.270
Even if he doesn't,
I'll tossing him to the side.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.607
- You want me to help you with the plates?
- Yeah.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.343
[Irma] Well, just hand me
mine, you can take yours.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.814
<i>[Julian] I'm looking to change
to be a better husband.</i>

15:16.816 --> 15:18.683
<i>Because I know
I'm letting Irma down.</i>

15:18.685 --> 15:23.554
Because I promised her something
better when we got together.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.224
He knows how sad I feel that
we can't go out on date nights.

15:26.226 --> 15:29.761
Because I vent it to him
all the time.

15:29.763 --> 15:33.865
<i>But he won't go out. I mean,
if he does it's for food, not me.</i>

15:33.867 --> 15:36.401
<i>And that's upsetting.</i>

15:36.403 --> 15:39.637
- Was they finished?
- Yeah. I'm fixing them now.

15:39.639 --> 15:43.241
- All right, I like a lot of sour cream.
- I know.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.778
<i>[Julian] So with the
breaking point I'm getting to,</i>

15:46.780 --> 15:50.648
<i>I'm going to go out of my comfort
zone to try to get help from Dr. Now.</i>

15:50.650 --> 15:53.384
<i>Irma has been
pushing me to do that.</i>

15:53.386 --> 15:56.421
<i>And I know I'm at a point
where that's the option I need.</i>

15:56.423 --> 15:59.724
<i>So I'm going to try
to go to him and get his help.</i>

15:59.726 --> 16:03.761
<i>I just have a lot of worries
still about my ability to succeed.</i>

16:03.763 --> 16:06.631
<i>You know, I'm ready to do
what I have to.</i>

16:06.633 --> 16:08.633
<i>If somebody
can give me guidance.</i>

16:08.635 --> 16:11.402
<i>And help intervene with
something like weight loss surgery.</i>

16:11.404 --> 16:13.571
<i>If I can have the chance
for that path,</i>

16:13.573 --> 16:16.541
<i>then I'm ready to do whatever
it takes to make it happen.</i>

16:16.543 --> 16:19.410
<i>So I can make for a
better life for me and Irma.</i>

16:21.714 --> 16:25.216
Here, take this too,
cause I'm not eating it.

16:25.218 --> 16:29.821
Honestly, our intimacy
has changed a lot.

16:29.823 --> 16:35.026
<i>[Irma] We can't be together,
like, we were because he's too big,</i>

16:35.028 --> 16:37.161
<i>I mean, like,
I really do love him.</i>

16:37.163 --> 16:43.501
But it frustrates me to the core
that he has not lost the weight yet.

16:43.503 --> 16:48.206
<i>Because I have no doubt that he can
do it if he really wanted to, you know.</i>

16:48.208 --> 16:53.011
<i>And I need him to start trying
before it's too late.</i>

16:57.649 --> 16:59.917
<i>[Julian] I know the odds of
something very bad happening to me.</i>

16:59.919 --> 17:02.320
<i>So I tell myself everyday.</i>

17:02.322 --> 17:04.756
You know what,
"Forget the dangers outside.

17:04.758 --> 17:09.427
<i>I'mma just go ahead and get up
at 6:00 in the morning and go walk."</i>

17:09.429 --> 17:12.163
<i>And start eating right
like I should be doing.</i>

17:12.165 --> 17:14.132
<i>But then I wake up
and I give in right away.</i>

17:14.134 --> 17:17.702
<i>Because the cravings are too
strong, you know. It's too much for me.</i>

17:17.704 --> 17:22.540
<i>But that has to change now. Because I
know I need help to lose all the weight.</i>

17:22.542 --> 17:26.277
<i>And I know if I don't get it,
I'm not going to make it.</i>

17:26.279 --> 17:31.549
<i>And I'm hoping that Dr. Now will it
be able to give me the help I need.</i>

17:31.551 --> 17:34.786
<i>Because if I don't get that,
I'm very scared about the future.</i>

17:34.788 --> 17:37.055
<i>And what's gonna happen
to me soon.</i>

17:48.767 --> 17:51.669
I'm nervous about this trip,
this long ride.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.337
Thanks for taking me.

17:53.339 --> 17:56.674
- I love you, boo.
- I love you too, baby.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.609
<i>[Julian] Today, we're gonna
start heading to Houston.</i>

17:58.611 --> 18:01.512
<i>And me and Irma are just looking at
our route we're gonna have to take.</i>

18:01.514 --> 18:05.116
<i>And how long it's going
to be for me on the road.</i>

18:06.752 --> 18:11.589
<i>And that's my first fear. Being shoved
into a small space for a long time.</i>

18:11.591 --> 18:14.525
<i>And how that's gonna be
on my whole body?</i>

18:14.527 --> 18:18.129
<i>And then also just all the
things that could go wrong.</i>

18:19.131 --> 18:22.200
I almost had a panic attack.
Thinking about, like...

18:22.301 --> 18:26.037
[Irma speaking]

18:26.039 --> 18:30.141
I was just thinking about... What if
something happens? on our way there.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.610
We in the middle of the road and
I gotta be rushed to the hospital.

18:32.612 --> 18:37.648
Something happens to me on
the road and I get stuck, like...

18:37.650 --> 18:40.485
You know, I have a huge panic attack
where I think I'm having a heart attack.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.920
<i>Or I can have
a natural heart attack.</i>

18:42.922 --> 18:46.290
<i>And not have any help nearby
because there won't be an ambulance</i>

18:46.292 --> 18:48.693
<i>that I can fit in,
in an emergency.</i>

18:48.695 --> 18:51.129
That's the most thing
I'm afraid of.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.698
You know I'll be thinking.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.368
- I think the luggage is in the refrigerator.
I mean-- - In the refrigerator? [laughs]

18:57.370 --> 19:00.571
- In the closet sorry.
- All right, baby.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.774
<i>[Julian] This is scary. But I
know it's a fear that I have to face.</i>

19:03.776 --> 19:05.476
<i>Because there's
no help for me here.</i>

19:05.478 --> 19:07.512
- If you could grab my shoes.
- Okay.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.915
<i>[Julian] So my only option
is to go where there is help.</i>

19:10.917 --> 19:14.952
<i>And that means I have to travel
what looks to be a 15 hour drive</i>

19:14.954 --> 19:15.887
<i>according to the maps.</i>

19:15.889 --> 19:18.856
<i>It's just gonna be
very hard on me.</i>

19:18.858 --> 19:21.859
<i>Even doing what we have to do to
get packed, I'm getting sore, you know.</i>

19:21.861 --> 19:24.862
Already my legs
and back is hurting.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.465
<i>So I'm just worried about
how this is gonna go.</i>

19:27.467 --> 19:29.534
- Okay.
- Okay, push it down.

19:29.536 --> 19:33.104
<i>But I'm hoping by doing this I
get the help I need from Dr. Now.</i>

19:34.339 --> 19:36.741
<i>[Irma] Julian is very afraid
right now.</i>

19:36.743 --> 19:40.611
<i>He's had some panic attacks throughout
the night, worrying about the trip.</i>

19:40.613 --> 19:42.346
<i>About, what could go wrong.</i>

19:42.348 --> 19:44.682
<i>But I've been trying to calm him</i>

19:44.684 --> 19:47.385
<i>and telling him that everything's
gonna be okay, you know.</i>

19:47.387 --> 19:48.786
- That's good.
- We did it.

19:48.788 --> 19:52.823
I feel like it's going
to be very tiring.

19:52.825 --> 19:56.861
<i>And I know being in the car for
that long, it's going to be hard for him.</i>

19:56.863 --> 20:00.231
<i>But I know he can do this
and will be okay.</i>

20:00.233 --> 20:02.667
<i>I think what he's worried
about the most is</i>

20:02.669 --> 20:06.304
<i>that we are going to make it all the
way to Houston and once we get there,</i>

20:06.306 --> 20:10.241
Dr. Now is going to reject
him because of his hernia.

20:10.243 --> 20:14.345
<i>[Irma] That's his big fear. But I'm
not worried about that, you know.</i>

20:14.347 --> 20:18.583
<i>I'm just glad Julian is doing
this and he is trying for this help.</i>

20:18.585 --> 20:22.486
I'm feeling optimistic about
the appointment with Dr. Now.

20:22.488 --> 20:26.824
<i>I do have good hopes.
Hopefully he is able to tell him</i>

20:26.826 --> 20:29.994
<i>like "You know what, yeah, let's
go ahead and get you approved."</i>

20:29.996 --> 20:33.364
I know it might not
happen on the first try, but,

20:33.366 --> 20:36.000
and hopefully
he'll just like say yes.

20:36.002 --> 20:42.273
And hopefully there is no medical emergencies
or no car emergencies or anything.

20:42.275 --> 20:45.142
And just wanna have a good trip.

20:46.545 --> 20:49.513
<i>[Julian] My plan is to sit in the
back and get as comfortable as I can.</i>

20:49.515 --> 20:51.849
<i>I'm making a little palace
so I can lay down.</i>

20:51.851 --> 20:56.487
<i>And try to stretch out to keep as
much strain off my body as I can.</i>

20:56.489 --> 20:57.722
[Irma] You're gonna
come in through here, Baby?

20:57.724 --> 21:00.725
- No, I'm setting up all the pillows.
- Oh okay.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.427
<i>[Julian] So we can keep
going as long as possible.</i>

21:03.429 --> 21:08.899
<i>Our goal is to go between six to eight hours
at a time with as few stops as possible.</i>

21:08.901 --> 21:11.402
- You need help now?
- No. I'll get in.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.670
[Julian breathes heavily]

21:12.672 --> 21:14.805
<i>[Julian] So we can
get there in two days.</i>

21:14.807 --> 21:16.707
<i>But that all depends on
how I'm handling the trip.</i>

21:16.709 --> 21:20.611
[Julian breathing heavily]

21:20.613 --> 21:23.514
- Do you need me to get my seat up?
- [Julian exclaims] No.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.384
- You sure?
- [panting] No. I'm okay.

21:27.719 --> 21:30.087
<i>[Julian] And how Irma
is handling the driving</i>

21:30.089 --> 21:32.323
<i>because it's all on her
for that, you know.</i>

21:32.491 --> 21:34.992
And I wish I can drive
too, myself,

21:34.994 --> 21:38.829
<i>but if everything goes well, I
should be behind the wheels soon.</i>

21:38.831 --> 21:43.200
[Julian breathing heavily]

21:44.970 --> 21:46.337
[sighs heavily] Oh God.

21:46.838 --> 21:48.439
[Irma] I know, baby.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.209
Trust me, it will be
all worth it, my love.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.644
Okay.

21:55.013 --> 21:57.748
I'mma try to just listen to
my music in my headphones,

21:57.750 --> 22:00.584
try to keep myself calm.

22:00.586 --> 22:03.120
[Julian] Okay.
Go ahead.

22:03.122 --> 22:05.089
<i>And depending on
how my body is doing,</i>

22:05.091 --> 22:08.392
<i>see how far we can make it
before we have to stop and rest.</i>

22:23.608 --> 22:28.212
<i>I'm already exhausted, but I'm gonna
try to hold out as long as I can like this.</i>

22:28.214 --> 22:31.782
<i>You know it's tight,
but I think I can manage.</i>

22:31.784 --> 22:34.952
<i>Our plan is to be able to get there
in two days if I can handle that.</i>

22:34.954 --> 22:38.689
<i>But we added an extra day in
case I need a little more time.</i>

22:38.691 --> 22:41.125
<i>So my appointment
is in four days,</i>

22:41.127 --> 22:45.062
<i>and if it all goes well, I'll have
a full day of rest in Houston.</i>

22:45.464 --> 22:47.198
<i>But we'll see!</i>

22:50.402 --> 22:53.404
- [Irma] How you feeling, my love?
- My butt is getting numb.

22:54.406 --> 22:56.674
You said we have about
20 minutes left?

22:56.676 --> 22:59.543
Now we have 11 minutes.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.880
- I'm pretty sure tomorrow will be longer.
- Yeah.

23:02.882 --> 23:07.351
- That's when the real test of time will come in.
- Oh yes, sir!

23:08.754 --> 23:10.821
<i>[Julian] I made it
as far as I could,</i>

23:10.823 --> 23:14.425
<i>but my whole lower body
is in a lot of pain.</i>

23:15.594 --> 23:19.196
<i>So I need to get out and rest
before we can continue.</i>

23:21.933 --> 23:25.269
- I just need your help with getting my shoes on.
- Okay.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.277
[Julian groans]

23:36.681 --> 23:39.350
[panting]

23:40.585 --> 23:43.421
- My baby, you're all sweaty.
- Yeah. It is hot.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.301
[Irma] Watch it with the door.
It's really heavy.

23:58.603 --> 23:59.970
Oh, there you go.

23:59.972 --> 24:04.975
- Oh, this is nice.
- It is nice.

24:10.081 --> 24:11.248
[Julian sighs heavily]

24:11.583 --> 24:16.287
Oh! Oh, yes!
[Julian exhales]

24:18.623 --> 24:22.193
[Julian] What do you think
this guy's gonna say?

24:22.195 --> 24:27.331
I don't think he's gonna say a lot, baby.
I think he's just gonna say like, 750?

24:28.433 --> 24:31.035
I wanna say 752.

24:31.670 --> 24:37.541
Like, what if the scale is
more than what we think it is?

24:37.543 --> 24:41.212
- Like... I know baby.
- That's gonna be a shocker, you know.

24:41.780 --> 24:46.984
I am not letting you mess
this up, baby. Hell no!

24:48.920 --> 24:51.422
Like, I know, that he ain't gonna
approve you "right now" right now.

24:51.424 --> 24:52.923
No, no.

24:52.925 --> 24:57.361
- But I mean like the next time, you have no excuse.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:16.948 --> 25:19.984
[Julian breathing heavily]

25:48.680 --> 25:50.281
Valentine?

25:53.518 --> 25:55.853
<i>[Julian] It's been awhile
since I was on a scale,</i>

25:55.855 --> 25:59.557
<i>but my highest weight
I've been at was 798.</i>

25:59.559 --> 26:05.496
<i>I'm hoping I'm down closer to
the 750s and not still in the 790s.</i>

26:05.498 --> 26:12.970
If I had to guess, I think his weight
is probably like, around 730, maybe.

26:13.872 --> 26:16.440
<i>[Julian] So I'm looking for
some weight loss right now.</i>

26:17.542 --> 26:19.810
Okay, you can step up
on the scale.

26:19.812 --> 26:25.082
<i>Because the bigger I am, The
less I have time to change things.</i>

26:51.242 --> 26:53.744
<i>[Julian] I'm at Dr. Now's,
for my first appointment.</i>

26:53.746 --> 26:56.413
<i>And I'm about to find out
what my weight's up to.</i>

26:59.784 --> 27:02.152
Your weight is 830.

27:02.654 --> 27:04.054
[Julian] That's crazy.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.094
- We're going to Room 5.
- Okay.

27:15.834 --> 27:18.335
<i>[Julian] I was scared
that I was close to 800,</i>

27:18.337 --> 27:20.604
<i>and now I find out
I'm over that amount.</i>

27:20.606 --> 27:25.142
<i>So it's worse, and I know
that's hard for Irma to absorb.</i>

27:25.144 --> 27:29.013
<i>And I know it's just a shock
for her. It's a shock for me, too.</i>

27:41.926 --> 27:43.160
[Julian speaking]

27:53.471 --> 27:54.838
[knock on door]

27:58.009 --> 28:00.878
-Hello, how are you'll doing?
-We're doing good. how you doing?

28:00.880 --> 28:01.879
- [Dr. Now] Good!
- Good.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.982
- All right, you must be Julian?
- Yes.

28:04.984 --> 28:09.086
- And who is this with you today?
- My wife, Irma.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.821
- Hi.
- All right, nice to meet you guys.

28:10.823 --> 28:13.457
- You are coming from Arizona?
- Yes.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.427
- Tucson, Arizona?
- Mm-hmm.

28:16.429 --> 28:22.766
Well, you are 830 pounds. So doing
all that puts a lot of strain on your body.

28:22.768 --> 28:25.803
So that's gonna be as issue
with you coming here.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.405
But before we get into all that,

28:28.407 --> 28:31.442
tell me what brought
you all the way here?

28:31.444 --> 28:36.847
I want to take control back of my life and
I hope I can get this weight loss surgery.

28:36.849 --> 28:40.718
Well, doing surgery on someone
your size is going to be difficult.

28:40.720 --> 28:45.923
- But listen. Your BMI is 112.
- Yes.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.858
And, do you know
what the normal BMI is?

28:47.860 --> 28:50.728
I think around 60.

28:50.730 --> 28:54.565
- It is 18 to 25.
- Oh! 18 to 25.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.401
So, you're way over that.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.670
And you're almost
the highest BMI we have seen.

28:59.672 --> 29:02.306
- And you are what, 33 years old?
- Thirty-three.

29:02.308 --> 29:05.409
Okay. You know the risk of
people have a sudden death

29:05.411 --> 29:07.511
- with this BMI is very high.
- Yes.

29:07.513 --> 29:10.514
So every day you wake up
is the roll of the dice.

29:10.516 --> 29:13.417
- Whether that day will be that your heart is gonna give up...
- Mm-hmm.

29:13.419 --> 29:17.888
And if it does, there is nothing
anybody can do to resuscitate

29:17.890 --> 29:18.689
or bring you back.

29:18.691 --> 29:19.656
- Yes.
- Okay.

29:19.658 --> 29:22.793
- Your body is made to be 200 pounds.
- Yes.

29:22.795 --> 29:26.897
And you're 800. You're killing
yourself with food for a while now.

29:26.899 --> 29:29.066
And you still
haven't stopped overeating.

29:29.068 --> 29:34.905
So what is different today after 33
years that's gonna make you change

29:34.907 --> 29:36.974
that hasn't, up to today?

29:37.842 --> 29:39.176
[Julian sighs]

29:39.178 --> 29:42.913
Um, I wanna have children.

29:42.915 --> 29:45.916
Okay, well, that's good then.
But then the question is,

29:45.918 --> 29:50.053
why haven't you tried to
change to have kids before now?

29:50.055 --> 29:51.822
I have.
I just couldn't stick to it.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.590
So, your gonna stick with it?

29:53.592 --> 29:56.326
- I'm sticking with it 110%.
- That's what your telling me?

29:56.328 --> 29:58.595
- I'm telling you I'm sticking with it.
- Okay.

29:58.597 --> 30:01.799
Well, I hope that's true
because if you continue like that,

30:01.801 --> 30:03.801
then you won't
be around much longer.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.469
- You understand that?
- Yes.

30:05.471 --> 30:10.340
- So, at this point, since you live so far away...
- Mm-hmm.

30:10.342 --> 30:14.711
I don't want you to come back until you lose
the weight loss goal I'm going to give you.

30:14.713 --> 30:18.315
Because there is no reason
to put that strain on your body

30:18.317 --> 30:20.417
if we're not gonna
move ahead with you.

30:20.419 --> 30:24.655
So, we'll set up an appointment
at a clinic in Tucson for you

30:24.657 --> 30:25.522
to get your weight checked.

30:25.524 --> 30:28.058
And if you've
made it to your goal,

30:28.060 --> 30:32.129
then, the next step is you're gonna have to
move down to Houston to do the program.

30:32.131 --> 30:34.431
So, is that something
that you can do?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.099
[both] Yeah. We can do that.

30:36.101 --> 30:39.369
Okay, I'm gonna give you
instructions that will show you

30:39.371 --> 30:41.972
- how to lose 100 pounds in two months.
- Two months.

30:41.974 --> 30:45.876
So, you're gonna have a diet
that is low-carb, high protein

30:45.878 --> 30:49.446
that limits you
to 1200 calories a day.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.281
And if you comply with it,

30:51.283 --> 30:54.852
you're gonna be able to lose
more that 200 pounds in two months.

30:54.854 --> 30:59.790
But the goal I'm giving you is
to only lose half that in that time.

30:59.792 --> 31:02.860
- So, there is no excuses, okay?
- Okay.

31:02.862 --> 31:05.329
So, stick to that
and what it says.

31:05.331 --> 31:08.232
And if you stick with it
from here on out,

31:08.234 --> 31:13.503
then, you're gonna be able to lose
600 pounds in a period of 18 months.

31:13.505 --> 31:14.638
Okay.

31:14.640 --> 31:18.775
- That's almost about three to four big people.
- Yeah.

31:18.777 --> 31:23.881
So, that's all. But you can do it if
you stick to what we tell you. Okay?

31:23.883 --> 31:25.983
- Thank you.
- Any questions?

31:26.050 --> 31:28.585
No. I'm, I'm okay.
I'm good.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.420
All right, I've seen your chart.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.556
You've had the hernia repair
in your stomach?

31:32.558 --> 31:34.358
Yeah. I do have
an umbilical cord hanging.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.759
Let me see what kind of scar
that ended up in there.

31:35.761 --> 31:39.663
- Well, you still have a hernia.
- Yeah. I still have it.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.366
- All right, let me go get some stuff for you, okay?
- Okay.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.305
[solemn instrumental
music playing]

31:50.241 --> 31:55.579
My biggest concern for Julian right
now is how high his weight and BMI is.

31:55.581 --> 31:58.515
<i>[Dr. Now] Thankfully, he is
not bedridden at this point.</i>

31:58.517 --> 32:02.119
And he is still able to
have some level of activity.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.588
<i>It would be much worse
if that wasn't the case.</i>

32:04.590 --> 32:09.927
<i>But the amount of strain that is on his body
from his weight is very dangerous for him.</i>

32:09.929 --> 32:13.664
To where it is just a matter of
time before something happens

32:13.666 --> 32:18.101
that pushes his body to a breaking
point, and he doesn't survive.

32:18.937 --> 32:23.006
All right,
let's go over some things.

32:23.008 --> 32:29.346
- This, um, first six pages explain what metabolism is.
- Mm-hmm.

32:29.348 --> 32:32.883
- And what healthy eating habits should be.
- Okay.

32:32.885 --> 32:37.554
Julian is the only one who can
start to make the changes needed

32:37.556 --> 32:40.223
to avoid his body getting
to a breaking point.

32:40.225 --> 32:43.493
<i>So, it's very important
he understands that.</i>

32:43.495 --> 32:47.831
<i>And starts to lose as much
weight as he can. As fast as he can.</i>

32:47.833 --> 32:50.567
<i>Reduce the strain he has
on his whole body</i>

32:50.569 --> 32:52.436
<i>before he let's it
get to a point</i>

32:52.438 --> 32:55.806
where something happens
and he runs out of time.

32:55.808 --> 32:59.876
<i>And until he does that, everyday
for him is a roll of the dice.</i>

32:59.878 --> 33:01.745
Where he might not make it.

33:01.747 --> 33:06.083
And this is... my book.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.919
- And in chapter 12...
- Uh-huh.

33:08.921 --> 33:13.557
You've got a list of exercise,
and to build up your stamina.

33:13.559 --> 33:14.791
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

33:14.793 --> 33:18.428
I'm going to give you
two months to lose 100 pounds.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.864
We will check that
at a local clinic with you

33:20.866 --> 33:23.767
- to see where you are and go from there.
- Okay.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.870
- You think you can do that?
- I can do that Dr. Now.

33:26.872 --> 33:29.606
- Under 700 pounds.
- Under 700 pounds.

33:29.608 --> 33:30.807
- Okay?
- Gotcha.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.809
All right, I'll see y'all later.

33:32.811 --> 33:33.777
- [Julian] See you later.
- See you.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.413
- All right, take care.
- [both] You too.

33:41.252 --> 33:44.955
Yeah. I'mma get started.
I'm gonna do this, babe.

33:44.957 --> 33:49.026
- I'm gonna have to do it too.
- That's good. I was hoping you would do it with me.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.293
Yep.

33:53.631 --> 33:57.667
<i>[Julian] This could be my
last chance to live longer.</i>

33:57.669 --> 34:02.406
<i>So, I'm gonna do everything
Dr. Now says from here on out.</i>

34:02.408 --> 34:06.576
<i>And I know it's gonna be hard.
Maybe the hardest thing I ever do.</i>

34:06.578 --> 34:07.544
Thank you.

34:07.546 --> 34:10.480
<i>But I'm in a fight
for my life now.</i>

34:10.482 --> 34:13.016
<i>So, from here on out,
there's no tomorrow.</i>

34:13.018 --> 34:16.186
<i>I either do this,
or I'm not gonna make it.</i>

34:16.954 --> 34:18.355
- I love you.
- I love you too.

34:30.201 --> 34:32.069
I hope it's good.

34:36.007 --> 34:40.110
<i>[Julian] I've been spending the past
month working hard at making progress.</i>

34:40.112 --> 34:45.148
<i>I started it all as soon as we got back home
since the road only had fast food options</i>

34:45.150 --> 34:48.618
<i>But since then, I've been
sticking to Dr. Now's diet.</i>

34:48.620 --> 34:54.091
<i>And doing all his exercises. And I'm feeling
pretty good about my progress so far.</i>

34:54.093 --> 34:58.562
All right babe,
let's get to working out.

34:58.564 --> 35:02.999
<i>Especially with my exercises. Because I've
been doing some boxing with a punching bag.</i>

35:03.001 --> 35:05.335
<i>And Irma's been
doing it with me.</i>

35:09.807 --> 35:11.408
[Irma] You got this, baby.
Come on.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.411
<i>When we first got back,</i>

35:14.413 --> 35:17.447
<i>the first thing we did is went
to go buy that punching bag.</i>

35:17.982 --> 35:20.217
- Holy [bleep]
- Sorry.

35:20.219 --> 35:21.818
You're good, you're good.
Keep going.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.421
[panting]

35:25.389 --> 35:26.923
[Irma]
Don't forget to inhale, baby.

35:26.925 --> 35:31.094
- [Irma] Three, two...
- [Julian whispers] One.

35:33.998 --> 35:37.167
- Your turn.
- Okay.

35:38.169 --> 35:39.936
[boxing bell rings]

Jab, jab, cross.

35:46.611 --> 35:48.145
Jab, cross.

35:49.413 --> 35:52.282
- Oh, I'd hate to get hit by you.
- Ha-ha.

35:52.284 --> 35:55.552
Okay. I'm done.

35:55.554 --> 35:58.788
<i>[Julian] So, I'm gonna keep
working at this over the next month.</i>

35:58.790 --> 36:02.025
<i>So that when I go to the
doctor and get my weight,</i>

36:02.027 --> 36:04.828
<i>I'm where I need to be
so I can move to Houston.</i>

36:04.830 --> 36:07.364
<i>And be ready to take that leap
when we have to,</i>

36:07.366 --> 36:10.467
<i>if it means I'm gonna get
the chance for surgery.</i>

36:10.469 --> 36:15.772
<i>But I know it's gonna come down to
me meeting my goal by next month.</i>

36:15.774 --> 36:18.275
<i>So that's what I'm working
my hardest to do.</i>

36:18.609 --> 36:20.310
Oh, Lord in heaven.

36:39.497 --> 36:42.999
<i>Me and Irma are headed
to the local clinic today.</i>

36:43.001 --> 36:45.702
<i>Dr. Now said it at first
to go there to get my weight.</i>

36:45.704 --> 36:50.974
<i>And if I made it to my goal, he said he
was gonna tell me I could move to Houston,</i>

36:50.976 --> 36:54.344
<i>to be a part of his program.
And get weight loss surgery.</i>

36:56.380 --> 36:58.048
Julian!

37:05.623 --> 37:10.627
<i>[Julian] In my last appointment
two months ago, I was 830 pounds.</i>

37:10.629 --> 37:14.164
<i>And Dr. Now told me
to lose 100 pounds.</i>

37:18.536 --> 37:22.005
<i>If I succeed,
I'll be under 730 today.</i>

37:30.648 --> 37:32.148
Okay, you must be
over the weight limit.

37:32.150 --> 37:33.583
Um. it's not
reading your weight.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.253
Oh, okay.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.188
-[nurse] Okay. Follow me to the room.
-Okay.

37:38.689 --> 37:40.323
<i>[Julian] I don't think
that's right.</i>

37:40.325 --> 37:43.927
<i>I know how hard I worked
for the past two months.</i>

37:43.929 --> 37:48.531
<i>You know, I've done the diet and
I've done the workouts everyday.</i>

37:48.533 --> 37:51.501
<i>So, there's no way
I'm over 800 still.</i>

37:51.503 --> 37:56.406
<i>You know, now I have to tell
Dr. Now "I'm over the limit."</i>

37:56.408 --> 38:00.810
<i>It's upsetting me because he's not gonna
think I've been working as hard as I have</i>

38:00.812 --> 38:02.212
<i>when I know I did.</i>

38:02.780 --> 38:05.382
<i>So, I'm just frustrated
right now.</i>

38:06.784 --> 38:09.886
- Hi Dr. Now.
<i>- Hi, Julian, how are you doing?</i>

38:09.888 --> 38:11.688
I'm doing good.
And yourself?

38:11.690 --> 38:13.089
<i>- Good.
- That's good.</i>

38:13.091 --> 38:14.657
<i>So, what's going on with you?</i>

38:14.659 --> 38:20.730
<i>- Where's your weight at today?
- Um, well, the scale couldn't read my weight.</i>

38:20.732 --> 38:25.635
<i>Well Julian, the scale that you got
over there, goes up to 800 pounds.</i>

38:25.637 --> 38:31.408
<i>If it could not read your weight, that
means that you're still over 800 pounds.</i>

38:45.856 --> 38:52.529
The changes I have made, um,
the diet I was stuck to... I wanna say--

38:52.531 --> 38:56.700
I don't want to say perfectly. But I've
stuck to it. I started doing meal preps.

38:56.702 --> 39:01.404
<i>- Well, how many times you eating in a day?
- I only eat twice a day.</i>

39:01.406 --> 39:03.606
<i>Well, you should have
lost weight, but you didn't.</i>

39:03.608 --> 39:08.011
<i>So your eating more than
you think with your meals.</i>

39:10.181 --> 39:17.087
<i>Sometimes I have pork rinds. I see
those are 70 calories with no sugar.</i>

39:26.831 --> 39:29.866
I am. I'm going to do it.
I only ate pork rinds one--

39:29.868 --> 39:31.401
<i>Then how come you
haven't lost any weight?</i>

39:31.403 --> 39:33.436
I really can't tell
'cause of the scale.

39:33.438 --> 39:40.076
I know you said it goes up to 800. But
I don't know. Like I said, I could be 801.

39:40.078 --> 39:43.313
<i>And the scale cannot read
your weight because your weight</i>

39:43.315 --> 39:45.382
<i>is still over 800 pounds.</i>

39:45.384 --> 39:49.285
<i>So, what is the point of
coming back in here and see us?</i>

39:49.287 --> 39:51.588
Because I'm sticking to it.

39:51.590 --> 39:55.592
<i>Well, if you're sticking to it, then you're
gonna show some positive changes.</i>

39:55.594 --> 39:57.660
Oh yeah.
I'm definitely gonna show it.

39:57.662 --> 40:01.297
I believe if I was there, it'll
be a different story than here.

40:01.299 --> 40:04.401
<i>Well, you're not showing it
on the scale.</i>

40:04.403 --> 40:09.539
<i>So, there's not much we can do if you
don't start changing your eating habits.</i>

40:09.541 --> 40:12.942
<i>So, whatever you're eating,
cut back and eat less,</i>

40:12.944 --> 40:14.878
<i>and I'm going to give you
another two months</i>

40:14.880 --> 40:18.214
<i>to lose 100 pounds from 830.</i>

40:18.216 --> 40:20.950
<i>So if you lost 30 pounds,
you have a leg up.</i>

40:20.952 --> 40:24.687
<i>And then we'll bring you back
here and check your weight again.</i>

40:24.689 --> 40:26.656
<i>And if you make it to your goal,</i>

40:26.658 --> 40:29.559
<i>then you can move
to Houston to do my program.</i>

40:29.561 --> 40:32.395
<i>If you want to continue.
But until then,</i>

40:32.397 --> 40:34.664
<i>there's no point for you
to be coming down, okay?</i>

40:34.666 --> 40:35.932
I got you.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.135
<i>And if you don't make it
to your goal this next time,</i>

40:39.137 --> 40:41.838
<i>then I don't know
what else we can do for you.</i>

40:41.840 --> 40:42.872
[Julian] Okay.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.141
<i>So go on the diet again.</i>

40:45.143 --> 40:47.043
<i>And if you need anything,
give me a call.</i>

40:47.045 --> 40:48.912
Okay, thank you.

40:48.914 --> 40:51.047
- All right, bye-bye.
- Bye.

40:51.415 --> 40:54.684
Well, I felt like I lost weight.

40:54.686 --> 40:57.821
Well, I mean, you already cut
down quite a bit? I don't know.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.722
Like, are you supposed
to eat like, air now?

40:59.724 --> 41:02.959
Yeah. I don't know.
We will see.

41:09.667 --> 41:14.437
I'm just frustrated, you know.
For him to say I'm not trying.

41:14.439 --> 41:16.573
It's just like a slap
in the face.

41:16.575 --> 41:19.509
<i>Because I know I could
have probably done better.</i>

41:19.511 --> 41:22.212
<i>But at the same time,
I feel like I've had progress</i>

41:22.214 --> 41:24.647
<i>that's not being accounted for
with that scale.</i>

41:24.649 --> 41:28.318
<i>And just because it's not showing up
doesn't mean I haven't made progress.</i>

41:28.320 --> 41:31.354
<i>So I'm pissed off
because of the scale.</i>

41:31.356 --> 41:35.758
I can understand if I stepped
on his scale and it said 830.

41:35.760 --> 41:41.197
<i>Yeah, I'll take all criticism there is.
But this scale... I can't trust this scale.</i>

41:42.433 --> 41:45.835
<i>I know Dr. Now says it reads
800 pounds.</i>

41:45.837 --> 41:47.470
<i>But maybe that scale
doesn't work, I don't know.</i>

41:47.472 --> 41:49.973
<i>Maybe it doesn't work
at its highest potential.</i>

41:49.975 --> 41:52.642
<i>And it reflect on me
pretty horribly right now.</i>

41:52.644 --> 41:54.410
<i>For me, to not to say
I'm not trying,</i>

41:54.412 --> 41:56.713
which I am.
I know I'm trying.

41:56.715 --> 41:59.682
<i>And I just feel I've not
been given the credit for that.</i>

41:59.684 --> 42:03.152
So, that's why I'm pissed off.

42:05.623 --> 42:08.691
<i>I just have to try harder,
I guess.</i>

42:08.693 --> 42:13.429
<i>Because getting weight loss surgery
from Dr. Now is my only chance I have left.</i>

42:33.217 --> 42:34.984
<i>[Julian] For the past month</i>

42:35.519 --> 42:39.055
<i>I've been doing what I said in my last
appointment, when I had talked to Dr. Now.</i>

42:39.823 --> 42:43.359
<i>And I've been working on
cutting back my eating even more.</i>

42:43.694 --> 42:47.397
<i>And it's been tough,
I'm not gonna to lie.</i>

42:47.399 --> 42:51.901
<i>You know, I feel like I'm barely eating
to the point where I'm just starving.</i>

42:51.903 --> 42:55.405
<i>To the point
where I feel weak at times.</i>

42:55.407 --> 42:57.540
<i>So, because of that,
my workouts have decreased.</i>

42:57.542 --> 43:00.076
<i>Because I don't have the energy.</i>

43:00.078 --> 43:04.013
<i>And there have been times
that feeling has made me give in</i>

43:04.015 --> 43:05.381
<i>to eat something I shouldn't.</i>

43:06.550 --> 43:09.619
<i>But for the most part,
that has not happened.</i>

43:09.621 --> 43:12.422
<i>Just because I feel like
I have less energy</i>

43:12.424 --> 43:15.959
<i>doesn't mean I have been
giving up on my exercises, though.</i>

43:16.660 --> 43:19.195
<i>I'm still getting in
my walking everyday.</i>

43:23.267 --> 43:25.602
<i>And I know
I'm making progress with that.</i>

43:25.604 --> 43:29.672
<i>Because I can do the whole
distance of the block now.</i>

43:29.674 --> 43:34.944
<i>When I could barely make it 10 or 15
feet from my driveway when I started.</i>

43:36.080 --> 43:39.082
<i>And I'm pushing myself
to do more each day.</i>

43:39.750 --> 43:42.218
- Good morning.
- Hey, Rose.

43:43.721 --> 43:45.688
I don't care if you drop.
Walk up to the corner.

43:45.690 --> 43:49.225
[Julian breathes heavily]
Come on Rose.

43:49.227 --> 43:52.629
<i>[Julian] That helps me feel
like I'm not in such isolation.</i>

43:52.631 --> 43:55.832
<i>Because I'm out, and I get to see
people I haven't seen in a while.</i>

43:55.834 --> 43:57.634
-Guess what?
-What's that? [Julian breathes heavily]

43:57.636 --> 43:58.735
You ain't walking fast enough.

43:58.737 --> 44:02.705
- Ah, well, that's these slippers.
- [Rose laughs]

44:02.707 --> 44:06.175
'Cause I don't want to trip.
They like to fold under me.

44:07.378 --> 44:08.911
<i>That feels good.</i>

44:08.913 --> 44:12.749
<i>So, I'm already seeing the ways
my progress is benefitting my life.</i>

44:12.751 --> 44:15.318
<i>And making improvements for me.</i>

44:15.886 --> 44:19.622
<i>Next month,
when I check my weight again,</i>

44:19.624 --> 44:21.991
<i>[Julian] I have
to be at my goal then</i>

44:21.993 --> 44:25.028
<i>if I want to get the go ahead
from Dr. Now</i>

44:25.030 --> 44:27.330
<i>to move to Houston
and get my surgery.</i>

44:28.699 --> 44:31.067
[exhales]

44:40.811 --> 44:43.312
- [Julian] Babe, drive with two hands.
- [Irma] Shut up.

44:46.417 --> 44:48.685
<i>[Julian] I just hope
I haven't gained any weight.</i>

44:48.687 --> 44:50.687
But we'll see how it goes.

44:50.689 --> 44:52.922
<i>To see if this scale works.</i>

44:52.924 --> 44:55.224
<i>- That's what I'm a little skeptical about.
- [Irma] Mm-hmm.</i>

44:55.226 --> 44:58.428
- [Julian] So...
- [Irma] Not like last time.

44:58.430 --> 45:03.833
[Julian] See if Dr. Now is ready
to chew me another [bleep] oh...

45:03.835 --> 45:07.070
<i>[Julian] And if we can, you know, get
the ball moving on gettin' down to Houston.</i>

45:07.072 --> 45:08.571
<i>[Irma] Mm-hmm.</i>

45:08.706 --> 45:12.308
<i>[Julian] I'm headed to another
local clinic to check my weight again.</i>

45:13.277 --> 45:15.411
<i>But I'm still a bit nervous,
you know...</i>

45:17.748 --> 45:22.085
<i>because I'm ready to start
having bigger progress for myself.</i>

45:22.087 --> 45:24.620
<i>And that's not gonna happen
until I move to Houston.</i>

45:24.622 --> 45:25.588
[Julian sighs]

45:27.725 --> 45:29.692
<i>So I know I have to have
the results</i>

45:29.694 --> 45:32.995
<i>that Dr. Now is looking
to see from me today...</i>

45:35.799 --> 45:38.401
<i>because I don't know what
more I can do at this point.</i>

45:48.011 --> 45:49.112
[nurse] Julian.

45:49.114 --> 45:51.080
- [Julian] Yes.
- [nurse] Come on back.

45:52.149 --> 45:54.417
Bye, baby. Love you too.

46:03.060 --> 46:04.160
[Julian] All right.

46:05.796 --> 46:06.963
There you go.

46:07.931 --> 46:09.098
Can you turn around?

46:18.108 --> 46:19.909
714.2.

46:19.976 --> 46:21.811
Thank you!

46:21.813 --> 46:23.179
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you.

46:25.082 --> 46:26.315
Thank you.

46:26.817 --> 46:27.984
[Julian] Thanks.

46:30.154 --> 46:31.220
[FaceTime ringing]

46:33.957 --> 46:34.824
<i>Hello.</i>

46:34.826 --> 46:35.725
Hey, Dr. Now.

46:35.727 --> 46:37.160
<i>Hi, Julian, how are you doing?</i>

46:37.162 --> 46:40.062
I'm doin' good.
I'm doin' real good.

46:41.098 --> 46:41.931
<i>[Dr. Now] Great!</i>

46:42.833 --> 46:44.400
<i>So what is your
weight doing now?</i>

46:44.402 --> 46:46.135
I'm down to 714 pounds.

46:46.137 --> 46:49.038
<i>Oh, so you lost
some weight, huh?</i>

46:49.273 --> 46:51.107
Yes, sir, I sure did!

46:51.109 --> 46:54.877
<i>That's great! You lost
over 100 pounds, huh?</i>

46:54.879 --> 46:57.180
<i>116 pounds to be exact.</i>

46:57.182 --> 46:58.347
Yes, sir!

47:05.923 --> 47:06.822
Okay, great.

47:11.195 --> 47:14.030
<i>And moving
in the right direction.</i>

47:14.032 --> 47:17.967
<i>And once you move down here,
if you continue to lose weight, then</i>

47:21.872 --> 47:23.406
- Perfect. Thank you, Dr. Now.
<i>- Okay.</i>

47:25.876 --> 47:27.643
<i>Continue with your progress
that you're making.</i>

47:27.645 --> 47:30.413
- Yes.
<i>- And continue to lose more weight, okay?</i>

47:30.415 --> 47:33.649
Yes, I am. I'm gonna continue doing
everything that you told me to do.

47:33.651 --> 47:38.221
<i>You've done a good job and,
uh... I'm proud of your progress.</i>

47:38.689 --> 47:40.556
<i>So keep up the good work.</i>

47:40.558 --> 47:43.926
<i>- Don't relax and go back to your eating habits.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

47:43.928 --> 47:46.796
<i>And if you gain weight, then
we're not gonna move ahead</i>

47:46.798 --> 47:48.831
<i>with weight-loss surgery
with you.</i>

47:48.833 --> 47:52.969
- Okay.
<i>- In the meantime, if you need anything give me a call, okay?</i>

47:52.971 --> 47:53.536
All right, thank you, Dr. Now.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.438
All right, buh-bye.

47:59.076 --> 48:02.745
<i>[Julian] Dr. Now is gonna go ahead
and approve me to move to Houston.</i>

48:02.747 --> 48:04.647
<i>I didn't lose the amount
that he wanted me to,</i>

48:04.649 --> 48:07.450
<i>but I lost enough.</i>

48:07.452 --> 48:09.819
<i>He was excited about my
progress. He was happy for me.</i>

48:09.821 --> 48:13.489
<i>And I-- I didn't get
chewed out like last time.</i>

48:13.491 --> 48:15.625
<i>After hearing that response
from Dr. Now,</i>

48:15.627 --> 48:19.562
<i>we're gonna go ahead and start
gettin' to packing so we can move.</i>

48:19.564 --> 48:21.597
<i>If I lose more weight,
continue just eating</i>

48:21.599 --> 48:23.799
<i>the correct way
that I'm supposed to eat,</i>

48:23.801 --> 48:26.369
<i>he'll end up approving me
for weight-loss surgery.</i>

48:26.371 --> 48:28.537
<i>That's the main thing
I'm looking forward to.</i>

48:28.539 --> 48:32.808
- [Irma] What?
- [Julian] Dr. Now, he approved us to move to Houston.

48:32.810 --> 48:35.978
So we gotta get home
and start packing

48:36.179 --> 48:38.814
so we can move.

48:38.816 --> 48:40.583
- Okay.
- ASAP.

48:40.585 --> 48:44.153
But he says as long
as I'm stickin' to my diet,

48:44.155 --> 48:47.123
he's allowing me to move
so we can move to Houston.

48:47.724 --> 48:49.792
Okay, um...

48:49.794 --> 48:55.731
Um, I'm kinda freakin' out, baby,
'cause we don't have anything packed up.

48:55.733 --> 48:58.968
I know.
So we gotta get to it!

49:05.842 --> 49:08.044
[Irma] So we're
really leavin', huh?

49:08.046 --> 49:09.445
Yes, we're really leavin'.

49:23.727 --> 49:26.062
[Irma speaking]

49:29.566 --> 49:31.200
Now, we're in Texas.

49:50.687 --> 49:52.388
<i>[Julian] This is our
second day on the road.</i>

49:52.390 --> 49:56.225
<i>And so far, things are going
better this time.</i>

49:58.829 --> 50:02.531
<i>And I think the weight I lost
and the stamina I have now</i>

50:02.533 --> 50:06.035
<i>that's helping me handle
the road a lot better.</i>

50:06.037 --> 50:09.205
<i>With this minivan, helping
me be more comfortable too.</i>

50:11.641 --> 50:12.975
<i>I have more room.</i>

50:13.710 --> 50:15.311
<i>We just made it into Texas.</i>

50:15.313 --> 50:18.214
<i>And we're hopin' to make it all the
way to Houston by the end of the day</i>

50:18.615 --> 50:19.515
<i>if I can handle it.</i>

50:19.517 --> 50:22.718
<i>And so far,
I'm feelin' good still.</i>

50:22.720 --> 50:26.922
<i>So as long as I can hold out, we
should be arriving in our new place</i>

50:26.924 --> 50:29.392
<i>and starting
a new life here very soon.</i>

50:44.141 --> 50:46.442
[dramatic music playing]

51:08.098 --> 51:10.299
[Irma inhales] Brother!

51:13.970 --> 51:15.438
It melted off?

51:17.574 --> 51:19.008
[Irma] Yeah.

51:20.043 --> 51:20.810
- [beep] - [Irma] I kept
tellin' Julian. I'm like,

51:20.812 --> 51:21.677
"There's something not right."

51:21.679 --> 51:24.146
I'm like, "There's something
going on."

51:24.148 --> 51:25.648
I'm like, "I don't see my brother. I
don't see my brother." "He's fine."

51:25.650 --> 51:28.517
I was trying to call you. And the
[beep] call wouldn't go through.

51:28.519 --> 51:32.021
But I said, "I told you that I
felt somethin' wasn't right."

51:32.856 --> 51:36.125
[Julian] Why do you
keep sayin', like, I'm the one

51:36.127 --> 51:39.095
who was goin' against
your intuition or something?

51:39.896 --> 51:41.096
[Irma] 'Cause you were!

51:41.098 --> 51:43.032
- You were like, "Baby, everything's fine."
- No, babe.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.501
[Julian] How I'm supposed
to know?

51:45.503 --> 51:48.704
What am I supposed to go with the
worst? I'm trying to calm you down.

51:48.706 --> 51:50.573
And you makin' it like
I'm just goin' against you.

51:50.575 --> 51:52.408
[Irma] Um, 'cause you...
That's a new slipper.

51:52.410 --> 51:54.376
[Julian] But I knew it.
But that's not how you say it.

51:55.779 --> 51:57.179
Man.

52:10.060 --> 52:12.962
<i>[Julian] This is basically
my nightmare.</i>

52:13.296 --> 52:14.630
[Julian speaking]

52:14.632 --> 52:16.232
[Irma speaking]

52:17.400 --> 52:20.336
<i>[Julian] Alejandro's trailer
is not fixable.</i>

52:20.770 --> 52:22.404
We're in Texas.

52:24.808 --> 52:27.042
And we have horrible service.

52:29.679 --> 52:32.581
We was doin' fine
until this happened.

52:32.583 --> 52:37.853
We might just leave this
trailer and leave our stuff.

52:37.855 --> 52:40.289
Who even knows if there's,
like, a rental place around here?

52:41.958 --> 52:43.792
<i>[Irma] I found out what happened
'cause my brother called me.</i>

52:43.794 --> 52:45.427
<i>He's all like,
"Hey, the tire went out."</i>

52:45.429 --> 52:47.563
So I was just, like,
imagining the worst.

52:47.565 --> 52:50.166
He's all like, "But I'm okay.
I'm okay. I'm okay."

52:50.168 --> 52:53.068
<i>'Cause he knows I, like,
freak out for anything.</i>

52:55.505 --> 52:58.507
<i>The longer we're here,
the more in danger we are.</i>

52:58.509 --> 53:01.243
And I don't wanna be a [beep]
sticker in the middle of the road.

53:02.712 --> 53:04.847
<i>[Julian] This is absolutely
the last situation</i>

53:04.849 --> 53:08.551
<i>someone who's my size
wants to be in.</i>

53:08.553 --> 53:12.421
<i>You know, I can't handle
the heat for long.</i>

53:12.423 --> 53:16.125
<i>The only positive thing is
that I still have air conditioning.</i>

53:16.393 --> 53:18.827
<i>So I'm okay for now.</i>

53:18.829 --> 53:21.764
<i>But if we stay here long, my
fear is the car could overheat.</i>

53:21.766 --> 53:23.299
<i>And we could run out of gas.</i>

53:23.301 --> 53:27.036
<i>And if that happens,
it's gonna be very bad for me.</i>

53:34.711 --> 53:38.080
<i>[Julian] Me and Irma have tried to
get a hold of a trailer rental place.</i>

53:38.082 --> 53:43.719
<i>So far, either no one nearby
has one, or it's too far to go get.</i>

53:43.721 --> 53:45.521
<i>And they can't bring it to us.</i>

53:45.523 --> 53:48.090
<i>So we're still not sure
what we're gonna do.</i>

53:53.797 --> 53:55.698
Do you think we could get it
somewhere safer?

53:55.700 --> 53:57.399
I mean, we can get new stuff.

53:57.401 --> 54:00.936
We just can take, like, the
bare necessities and that's it.

54:02.439 --> 54:03.605
We can't leave our bed!

54:03.873 --> 54:06.175
Uh-uh, I'm not gonna sleep
on the floor. Are you crazy?

54:06.876 --> 54:09.411
But it's still just stuff.

54:09.479 --> 54:10.679
But it's a bed.

54:10.681 --> 54:13.015
- I'm not gonna sleep on the floor.
- It doesn't matter.

54:14.184 --> 54:16.118
- All right.
- Yeah, just get it in the dirt, brother.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.286
All right.

54:18.388 --> 54:21.323
<i>[Julian] I guess we're
out of options at this point.</i>

54:22.659 --> 54:27.396
<i>We just have to figure out what
we can get in the truck and the van.</i>

54:27.398 --> 54:30.232
<i>And then we just
have to abandon the rest.</i>

54:32.936 --> 54:34.637
<i>And that's what it
comes down to now.</i>

54:34.639 --> 54:36.739
<i>We just can't stay out here.</i>

54:36.741 --> 54:41.010
<i>And if we don't have another
trailer, there's no other options.</i>

54:42.012 --> 54:44.046
<i>[Julian] This
is extremely disappointing.</i>

54:44.048 --> 54:45.481
<i>And I'm very frustrated</i>

54:45.483 --> 54:46.948
<i>because we're having to choose</i>

54:46.950 --> 54:50.419
<i>between what we need to
survive and all our personal things.</i>

54:50.421 --> 54:53.122
<i>So this is just
heart-wrenching for me.</i>

55:13.076 --> 55:16.078
<i>[Julian] Just one more bad
thing to pile on me right now.</i>

55:16.080 --> 55:20.149
<i>When I'm tryin' to do right and
work all that I can to get better.</i>

55:22.919 --> 55:24.653
<i>So this is just upsetting.</i>

55:24.655 --> 55:25.854
[Irma] No, it's no use.

55:25.856 --> 55:27.856
<i>[Julian] But we'll do
what we have to do</i>

55:27.858 --> 55:29.191
<i>because that's our only option.</i>

55:32.762 --> 55:33.829
[Irma] And this.

55:36.966 --> 55:39.201
Are you okay with leaving
the punching bag or no?

55:40.136 --> 55:41.170
[Irma] I'm sorry.

55:42.572 --> 55:43.972
Hey.

55:54.684 --> 55:56.885
[Irma] It's a... tornado.
It looks [beep] scary.

55:56.887 --> 55:57.853
[Julian] It's not a tornado!

55:58.221 --> 55:59.555
<i>[Julian] Some bad weather's
rolling in.</i>

55:59.557 --> 56:02.658
<i>And there's a tornado warning
for this area!</i>

56:02.660 --> 56:06.762
<i>So as soon as we can, we gotta get
back on the road before that happens.</i>

56:06.764 --> 56:08.497
- [Julian] Shut the car off.
- [Irma] I am.

56:08.499 --> 56:10.866
<i>[Julian] And, hopefully,
it'll pass us by.</i>

56:10.868 --> 56:16.004
[sighs] It just sucks that we
have to get rid of everything!

56:16.006 --> 56:18.440
We're gonna have to leave
[beep] deep freezer.

56:19.042 --> 56:20.743
[Julian] We can't leave that!

56:20.745 --> 56:23.145
- Why not?
- There's food in there.

56:23.147 --> 56:25.047
Julian, we have no other choice!

56:25.049 --> 56:27.716
<i>[Julian] We're figuring out what
we can take and what we can't</i>

56:27.718 --> 56:29.952
<i>so we can get outta here.</i>

56:30.820 --> 56:32.888
<i>But it's just not
an easy process.</i>

56:32.890 --> 56:35.891
Baby, we can't take
all the boxes!

56:35.893 --> 56:36.625
We have to!

56:36.627 --> 56:37.593
But we can't!

56:37.595 --> 56:40.429
But we have to.
The boxes are priority.

56:40.431 --> 56:43.799
Baby, most of those boxes
are just [beep] paperwork!

56:43.801 --> 56:46.168
There're not [beep]
paperwork, Julian.

56:46.569 --> 56:48.437
Baby, we can't take every--

56:48.439 --> 56:51.073
Fine, then you go see what's
[beep]... Go ahead.

56:54.177 --> 56:56.545
<i>[Julian] My stress level
is just high right now.</i>

56:56.547 --> 57:00.649
<i>And I'll be honest. If I had food,
I'd probably be eatin' right now.</i>

57:00.651 --> 57:04.787
<i>But I don't, so my focus is
on just figuring all this out.</i>

57:04.789 --> 57:06.422
I mean, we have to take
all the boxes.

57:07.824 --> 57:08.957
We have to.

57:09.559 --> 57:12.227
<i>[Julian] But it's like
a lose-lose situation</i>

57:12.229 --> 57:15.197
<i>because there's so much we
need that we just can't leave.</i>

57:19.636 --> 57:21.470
[Irma] Baby, let's go
back inside.

57:21.472 --> 57:24.840
<i>[Julian] We gotta get on the road
soon because when night-time comes,</i>

57:24.842 --> 57:28.010
<i>we're not gonna have
the light to do this.</i>

57:28.012 --> 57:29.445
I gotta-- We gotta
look through this.

57:29.447 --> 57:32.181
[Irma sighs]

57:41.357 --> 57:43.625
<i>[Julian] We're pretty much
out of time at this point</i>

57:43.627 --> 57:46.395
<i>because it's late and we
have to get off the road.</i>

57:46.863 --> 57:49.331
<i>A road utility person saw us</i>

57:49.333 --> 57:51.300
<i>and they stopped
to put on their lights</i>

57:51.302 --> 57:54.603
<i>to make sure no one doesn't
see us in the dark and hit us.</i>

57:54.605 --> 57:57.739
<i>So, thankfully that's one thing we
don't have to worry about right now,</i>

57:57.741 --> 58:00.776
<i>but we're just gonna have
to take a hit with our stuff</i>

58:00.778 --> 58:02.911
<i>because that issue
we can't figure out.</i>

58:02.913 --> 58:05.747
<i>We can't agree on what we need
to take between me and Irma,</i>

58:05.749 --> 58:09.084
<i>and what we do agree on,
we can't find.</i>

58:09.086 --> 58:10.452
<i>So we're just loading up
what we can</i>

58:10.454 --> 58:13.755
<i>based off what we think is
in each box.</i>

58:13.757 --> 58:15.757
<i>And hopefully when we get to
Houston and open everything up,</i>

58:15.759 --> 58:17.826
we have a lot of what we need.

58:17.828 --> 58:21.163
<i>If not, then I guess we'll
just have to figure it out.</i>

58:22.665 --> 58:26.068
<i>And if I don't get the surgery
and all this doesn't pay off,</i>

58:26.070 --> 58:28.737
<i>and then all the pain
and suffering we went through</i>

58:28.739 --> 58:30.239
<i>was for nothing.</i>

58:42.585 --> 58:44.553
- [Alejandro] Right here?
- [Irma] On Meadow Drive.

58:44.555 --> 58:46.488
It's this next street
right up here.

58:46.490 --> 58:48.657
<i>[Julian] We're finally
in Houston.</i>

58:48.659 --> 58:51.894
<i>We're heading to the apartment
to get the keys and stuff.</i>

58:51.896 --> 58:53.829
[Irma] We're your
future residents.

58:53.831 --> 58:55.998
<i>[Julian] This has been
a long journey,</i>

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
<i>but I'm thankful to be here.</i>

58:58.535 --> 59:00.669
It looks like
a nice neighborhood.

59:00.671 --> 59:02.938
We'll see exactly
how everything goes

59:02.940 --> 59:05.374
once we get in
and get the place.

59:24.661 --> 59:26.395
- We did it. Mm-hmm.
- Got it.

59:27.597 --> 59:29.431
- Let's go check it out.
- All right.

59:30.700 --> 59:32.167
[Julian sighs] Oh, this is
gonna be...

59:32.835 --> 59:34.102
Yeah, we're upstairs.

59:36.940 --> 59:39.374
Oh, baby, you're gonna
hate this.

59:42.745 --> 59:45.213
Go ahead, bro, it's gonna
take me a minute.

59:48.084 --> 59:50.085
[Irma] Dude, there's
mosquitoes in here!

59:56.025 --> 59:57.192
[chuckling] Help.

59:57.427 --> 59:58.393
[Irma chuckles]

1:00:00.563 --> 1:00:02.130
Okay.

1:00:03.766 --> 1:00:06.335
- Okay, I can work with this.
- All right, babe.

1:00:06.337 --> 1:00:08.136
Okay, babe!

1:00:08.138 --> 1:00:10.572
<i>[Julian] After losing most
of our stuff on the road,</i>

1:00:10.574 --> 1:00:15.611
<i>at that time I was second-guessing
it, and I wanted to just go back,</i>

1:00:15.613 --> 1:00:22.317
but I figure God didn't make
me go this far to just turn around.

1:00:22.319 --> 1:00:24.553
<i>It's probably his way of
saying we don't need that stuff</i>

1:00:24.555 --> 1:00:30.659
<i>or it's the devil's way of trying
to make us not fulfill this journey.</i>

1:00:30.661 --> 1:00:34.296
So, it's just materials.
We can get that stuff back.

1:00:34.298 --> 1:00:36.698
Ew, there's a bug right there!
[Irma squeals]

1:00:36.700 --> 1:00:38.634
It's okay. We'll get him out.

1:00:38.636 --> 1:00:39.868
Oh, this has got a closet, too!

1:00:39.870 --> 1:00:42.971
- Look how huge it is.
- Damn!

1:00:43.573 --> 1:00:45.407
I'm gonna go check
the other room.

1:00:45.409 --> 1:00:48.176
I can work in there.
I can work in both.

1:00:49.812 --> 1:00:51.013
Let's do the test.

1:00:51.015 --> 1:00:52.381
Look, babe!

1:00:54.083 --> 1:00:56.385
Holy [bleep]

1:00:57.820 --> 1:00:59.888
I like the window.

1:00:59.890 --> 1:01:02.958
I like the carpet, man.
The carpet is like...

1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:04.326
Let's see how it feels
with no shoes on.

1:01:05.128 --> 1:01:07.062
<i>[Julian] So we're gonna
head to Dr. Now's</i>

1:01:07.064 --> 1:01:08.029
<i>once we get done here.</i>

1:01:08.031 --> 1:01:09.731
<i>I feel a lot better
now that we're here</i>

1:01:09.733 --> 1:01:11.967
<i>and we're able to see the place.</i>

1:01:13.436 --> 1:01:15.837
<i>We called Dr. Now yesterday
to give him an update</i>

1:01:15.839 --> 1:01:19.341
<i>and I asked him if we can come
see him when I got here today,</i>

1:01:19.343 --> 1:01:23.145
<i>so I can get my weight
and he can verify my progress</i>

1:01:23.147 --> 1:01:27.049
<i>so I can see about hopefully getting
approved for my weight-loss surgery.</i>

1:01:36.225 --> 1:01:39.828
<i>[Julian] It's been a tough three
months since this last weigh-in,</i>

1:01:39.830 --> 1:01:43.932
<i>but I've been able to work hard
so I know I'll see some progress.</i>

1:01:43.934 --> 1:01:47.202
<i>The question is, if it's gonna
be enough for Dr. Now.</i>

1:01:48.037 --> 1:01:51.306
<i>So that's the only thing
that has me a little nervous.</i>

1:01:56.846 --> 1:01:58.246
It's gonna be all right, baby.

1:02:07.523 --> 1:02:08.957
Julian.

1:02:15.565 --> 1:02:18.934
<i>[Julian] At my last appointment,
I made it down to 714.</i>

1:02:18.936 --> 1:02:21.103
<i>And Dr. Now told me
to keep losing.</i>

1:02:22.672 --> 1:02:24.106
<i>And I think I've done that,</i>

1:02:24.108 --> 1:02:28.143
<i>but I'm hoping I made it to
at least the 600s at this point.</i>

1:02:29.712 --> 1:02:32.948
Your weight is 792.

1:02:33.082 --> 1:02:37.619
[somber piano music playing]

1:02:37.621 --> 1:02:39.354
<i>[Julian] Just in shock
right now.</i>

1:02:40.423 --> 1:02:42.591
<i>I'm scared to how
Dr. Now's gonna react.</i>

1:02:42.593 --> 1:02:46.895
<i>I know he's gonna say I
haven't been trying, but I have.</i>

1:02:46.897 --> 1:02:51.366
<i>I kept my focus on working to get
surgery because how bad I need it.</i>

1:02:52.335 --> 1:02:55.771
<i>And I'm worried
because getting the surgery</i>

1:02:55.773 --> 1:02:58.974
<i>is the whole reason why we
gave up our life to come here.</i>

1:03:02.612 --> 1:03:03.912
-Hello
-[Irma] Hi.

1:03:03.914 --> 1:03:06.414
- How you all doing?
- All right and good.

1:03:06.416 --> 1:03:07.883
[Dr. Now] Good. All right.

1:03:07.885 --> 1:03:11.620
Well, I'm sorry to hear
about all the trouble you said

1:03:11.622 --> 1:03:14.022
you had coming back down here.

1:03:14.024 --> 1:03:15.924
But you finally
made it in one piece.

1:03:15.926 --> 1:03:19.094
Yeah, we finally made it in one
piece and we got our apartment

1:03:19.096 --> 1:03:22.264
and it's beautiful
and we made it.

1:03:22.266 --> 1:03:28.670
All right, so the issue now is your weight
gain you had over the last three months.

1:03:28.672 --> 1:03:33.108
You gained almost 80 pounds, so
what happened to your eating habits?

1:03:33.110 --> 1:03:35.277
My eating habits has
been okay. I mean, it's...

1:03:35.279 --> 1:03:37.479
I've been really stressful

1:03:37.481 --> 1:03:41.449
and, like, I know it's not an excuse
to eat more and everything, but, um,

1:03:41.451 --> 1:03:46.788
my father-in-law passed and it's just
been real hard trying to find, you know,

1:03:46.790 --> 1:03:48.857
a place for my mom
and my grandma and all that.

1:03:48.859 --> 1:03:50.992
But my eating habits are back
to where they need to be now.

1:03:50.994 --> 1:03:53.395
No more cheating,
no more eating,

1:03:53.397 --> 1:03:54.996
you know, things I'm not
supposed to eat.

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:55.797
What do you mean
no more cheating,

1:03:55.799 --> 1:03:57.432
because you were
cheating before?

1:03:57.434 --> 1:04:00.335
You said you think
you were eating good.

1:04:00.337 --> 1:04:04.506
No, I won't say it's cheating,
you know, it's no excuse.

1:04:04.508 --> 1:04:06.908
You know, well, like, what
happened with my father-in-law

1:04:06.910 --> 1:04:08.677
and all that stress
I was going through, I just...

1:04:08.679 --> 1:04:11.513
You say that,
but at the same time,

1:04:11.515 --> 1:04:14.716
that's the excuse
you are giving me right now.

1:04:14.718 --> 1:04:17.986
And I get that. You have had
a lot of hard things happen,

1:04:17.988 --> 1:04:21.957
but life is full of hard things,
and it's okay to struggle,

1:04:21.959 --> 1:04:24.793
but not to use it as an excuse

1:04:24.795 --> 1:04:27.028
to justify damaging your health.

1:04:27.030 --> 1:04:28.830
[Dr. Now] That's never okay.

1:04:28.832 --> 1:04:30.966
[Julian] I know, I know,
and I'll do better.

1:04:30.968 --> 1:04:33.702
So you need to get back
on track now

1:04:33.704 --> 1:04:36.838
because you're back in just
the dangerous place you were

1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:38.306
when you first came to see me.

1:04:38.308 --> 1:04:41.076
You're almost back to the 800s.

1:04:41.078 --> 1:04:45.547
So you need to decide if you're gonna
do this like you said when you told me

1:04:45.549 --> 1:04:48.149
you're 100% committed.

1:04:48.151 --> 1:04:50.819
- [Dr. Now] So here's what you need to do, Julian.
- Yes.

1:04:50.821 --> 1:04:54.422
I want you to stick with
the original goal I gave you

1:04:54.424 --> 1:04:58.059
and lose 100 pounds
over the next two months.

1:04:58.061 --> 1:05:02.564
You're still where you could
easily lose 200 pounds in that time

1:05:02.566 --> 1:05:04.633
if you stick to the diet.

1:05:04.635 --> 1:05:08.403
If you do that, then I will schedule
you for weight loss surgery.

1:05:08.405 --> 1:05:12.974
If not, then we're not moving
ahead with you, okay?

1:05:12.976 --> 1:05:16.912
And, Irma, are you doing this
with him and losing any weight?

1:05:16.914 --> 1:05:18.146
Not much.

1:05:18.148 --> 1:05:21.516
Then you have to both motivate
each other. That's important,

1:05:21.518 --> 1:05:25.086
- especially if you're thinking of having a family.
- Yeah.

1:05:25.088 --> 1:05:28.390
- And that's gonna be some important thing for everybody.
- Yes.

1:05:28.392 --> 1:05:33.028
And so get back on track
and work together to do that.

1:05:33.030 --> 1:05:35.664
And I want you to lose
100 pounds in two months

1:05:35.666 --> 1:05:37.632
if you want to move ahead, okay?

1:05:37.634 --> 1:05:39.801
[Julian] Yes, sir.
I'm gonna do that.

1:05:39.803 --> 1:05:42.737
- Okay. Well, I'm glad you made it to Houston...
- Mm-hmm.

1:05:42.739 --> 1:05:45.874
and let's concentrate
on doing what you need,

1:05:45.876 --> 1:05:49.878
and let's see how things go
over the next two months, okay?

1:05:49.880 --> 1:05:51.913
- Okay.
- All right, see you all later.

1:05:51.915 --> 1:05:53.782
See you later, Dr. Now.

1:05:53.784 --> 1:05:55.984
- [Dr. Now] Okay, take care. Okay.
- Thank you.

1:05:57.887 --> 1:06:01.957
<i>[Dr. Now] It's obviously very
disappointing to see such a big move</i>

1:06:01.959 --> 1:06:03.725
back in the wrong direction
with Julian,

1:06:03.727 --> 1:06:07.963
and it's also disappointing that
he's making excuses for that.

1:06:07.965 --> 1:06:11.066
<i>I understand that things
have been really hard for him,</i>

1:06:11.068 --> 1:06:13.802
<i>but the big question
for Julian is</i>

1:06:13.804 --> 1:06:14.936
<i>if food is worth his life.</i>

1:06:14.938 --> 1:06:18.006
<i>Because at this point,
that's what he's risking</i>

1:06:18.008 --> 1:06:20.942
<i>every day his weight stays
as high as it is.</i>

1:06:20.944 --> 1:06:23.979
<i>So hopefully he gets
how serious this is</i>

1:06:23.981 --> 1:06:25.513
<i>to get back on track,</i>

1:06:25.515 --> 1:06:27.682
<i>to lose like he did before,</i>

1:06:27.684 --> 1:06:30.251
because his body
can't keep going like this.

1:06:33.022 --> 1:06:34.389
<i>[Julian] I'm disappointed,</i>

1:06:34.391 --> 1:06:35.556
<i>very disappointed,</i>

1:06:35.558 --> 1:06:37.692
<i>because I was hoping
and expecting</i>

1:06:37.694 --> 1:06:39.961
<i>to be able to move ahead
with my weight-loss surgery</i>

1:06:39.963 --> 1:06:41.997
<i>once I got down here.</i>

1:06:42.932 --> 1:06:45.066
<i>So that's a bit of a blow.</i>

1:06:52.408 --> 1:06:54.409
<i>But at least I'm still
in the game.</i>

1:06:54.411 --> 1:06:56.044
<i>And so, as long as I am,</i>

1:06:56.046 --> 1:06:57.912
<i>I still have a chance to fight,</i>

1:06:57.914 --> 1:07:00.081
<i>and that's all I can do.</i>

1:07:00.083 --> 1:07:03.118
<i>So, whatever it takes,
I'm gonna do it.</i>

1:07:20.770 --> 1:07:21.903
All right, babe, I'm gonna go

1:07:21.970 --> 1:07:22.904
do my workout.

1:07:22.906 --> 1:07:24.539
We'll be starting dinner
when I get back.

1:07:24.541 --> 1:07:27.208
- Okay, baby. Be careful.
- Not gonna take me long.

1:07:29.412 --> 1:07:32.380
<i>[Julian] The past month has
been good as far as I'm concerned.</i>

1:07:33.115 --> 1:07:34.983
<i>I've been able
to give my full focus</i>

1:07:34.985 --> 1:07:35.884
<i>to get back on track</i>

1:07:35.886 --> 1:07:36.951
<i>like how I need.</i>

1:07:36.953 --> 1:07:39.154
<i>And I've been
working hard at that.</i>

1:07:40.923 --> 1:07:42.590
<i>You know, I lost my punching bag</i>

1:07:42.592 --> 1:07:45.060
<i>because I had to leave it on
the side of the road coming here.</i>

1:07:45.062 --> 1:07:47.962
<i>But what I got to
replace it now is stairs,</i>

1:07:47.964 --> 1:07:49.097
<i>so I've been using those</i>

1:07:49.099 --> 1:07:51.599
<i>to do my exercises every day.</i>

1:07:51.601 --> 1:07:53.835
<i>When I first started,
when I first got here,</i>

1:07:53.837 --> 1:07:55.870
I would have
to go down the stairs

1:07:55.872 --> 1:07:57.906
just one leg at a time

1:07:57.908 --> 1:07:58.873
and then come up

1:07:58.875 --> 1:08:00.708
one leg at a time,

1:08:00.710 --> 1:08:03.645
<i>but now I can go down
both legs at a time,</i>

1:08:03.647 --> 1:08:06.047
<i>and come back up
both legs at a time.</i>

1:08:06.782 --> 1:08:07.916
<i>Because it's getting easier,</i>

1:08:07.918 --> 1:08:09.717
<i>so I'm gonna probably add</i>

1:08:09.719 --> 1:08:12.954
another go up
and down the stairs.

1:08:12.956 --> 1:08:14.889
<i>So that'll be three times
I go up and down.</i>

1:08:14.891 --> 1:08:16.391
[Irma] You done, baby?

1:08:16.393 --> 1:08:17.759
[out of breath] I'm
getting faster.

1:08:17.761 --> 1:08:19.160
Good.

1:08:21.063 --> 1:08:23.998
[panting] I might
up it to... three.

1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:25.967
How was it, baby?

1:08:25.969 --> 1:08:27.769
It was good,
I think it was getting easier.

1:08:27.771 --> 1:08:29.904
I'm proud of you.

1:08:29.906 --> 1:08:31.906
I started going down
just one at a time,

1:08:31.908 --> 1:08:33.308
but now I can do both legs.

1:08:33.909 --> 1:08:35.176
- Oh!
- Yeah.

1:08:35.178 --> 1:08:36.778
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

1:08:36.780 --> 1:08:38.413
Nice!

1:08:39.215 --> 1:08:41.649
<i>[Julian] But right now,
after my second one,</i>

1:08:41.651 --> 1:08:42.517
<i>I go inside</i>

1:08:42.519 --> 1:08:44.619
<i>and do my upper body exercises</i>

1:08:44.621 --> 1:08:46.855
<i>and Irma usually helps me,
like a trainer.</i>

1:08:46.857 --> 1:08:48.423
You need to work
on your legs, too.

1:08:49.758 --> 1:08:50.658
<i>[Julian] She's trying to give me</i>

1:08:50.660 --> 1:08:52.660
<i>as much support as she can.</i>

1:08:52.662 --> 1:08:55.063
<i>So we're doing this
as a team right now</i>

1:08:55.065 --> 1:08:56.865
<i>because she wants
to see me succeed at this</i>

1:08:56.867 --> 1:08:58.967
<i>as much as I want to.</i>

1:08:58.969 --> 1:09:01.002
If you want to,
you can relax a little bit

1:09:01.004 --> 1:09:02.837
and then do the rest of the ten.

1:09:02.871 --> 1:09:04.472
[exhales sharply] Okay.

1:09:04.474 --> 1:09:06.941
<i>[Julian] So she's being a big help
with me like this with my exercises.</i>

1:09:06.943 --> 1:09:08.076
<i>And with the diet,</i>

1:09:08.078 --> 1:09:09.878
<i>because we're both
eating the same</i>

1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:11.012
<i>from Dr. Now's diet.</i>

1:09:11.014 --> 1:09:13.715
forty, okay.

1:09:13.717 --> 1:09:15.116
[Irma] Do this one, the leg one.

1:09:15.118 --> 1:09:16.784
How about this one?

1:09:16.786 --> 1:09:18.419
This one don't have me extended.

1:09:18.421 --> 1:09:20.722
[Irma] No. Do this one.

1:09:20.756 --> 1:09:23.158
[Julian sighs] Okay.

1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:25.660
<i>So I'm feeling good
about how we're both doing</i>

1:09:25.662 --> 1:09:26.661
<i>and our progress</i>

1:09:26.663 --> 1:09:27.695
<i>because I'm more serious</i>

1:09:27.697 --> 1:09:29.797
<i>about getting
to where I need now,</i>

1:09:29.799 --> 1:09:31.633
<i>more than I've been
up to at this point.</i>

1:09:31.635 --> 1:09:32.700
<i>And my hope is that</i>

1:09:32.702 --> 1:09:35.036
<i>when I go back to see
Dr. Now in a month,</i>

1:09:35.038 --> 1:09:37.138
<i>that it'll be enough
for me to make it</i>

1:09:37.140 --> 1:09:38.806
<i>and get approved for surgery.</i>

1:09:38.808 --> 1:09:40.842
[pants and sighs]

1:09:40.844 --> 1:09:41.876
Good job, baby.

1:09:41.911 --> 1:09:42.877
Whoo!

1:09:42.879 --> 1:09:44.479
Do one more...
I'm just kidding.

1:09:44.481 --> 1:09:46.347
[laughs] I'm kidding,
I'm kidding.

1:09:49.084 --> 1:09:52.153
Do you want me to start
cutting up the stuff now, or?

1:09:53.689 --> 1:09:55.023
Yeah. Um, the onions? Yeah.

1:09:55.025 --> 1:09:56.391
How do you want me
to cut the onion,

1:09:56.393 --> 1:09:57.892
my way or your way?

1:09:57.894 --> 1:09:58.693
You can cut 'em your way.

1:09:58.695 --> 1:10:00.161
You sure?

1:10:00.163 --> 1:10:01.863
'Cause you don't like it
when I cut it that small.

1:10:01.865 --> 1:10:02.931
No, it's okay.

1:10:02.933 --> 1:10:04.966
[soft guitar music]

1:10:07.236 --> 1:10:09.103
I'mma come do the chicken.

1:10:09.838 --> 1:10:10.972
Okay.

1:10:18.714 --> 1:10:20.215
[groans]

1:10:24.954 --> 1:10:26.754
I like a little salad
with my onions.

1:10:26.756 --> 1:10:28.323
[laughs]

1:10:41.136 --> 1:10:42.770
- It's really good.
- Yeah, it is.

1:10:42.772 --> 1:10:46.174
Yeah, it's like, 10 minutes.

1:10:49.311 --> 1:10:52.347
Man, believe it or not,
I am getting full.

1:10:53.082 --> 1:10:54.315
- Good.
- Mm.

1:10:59.021 --> 1:11:01.155
That was a really
good dinner, babe.

1:11:01.157 --> 1:11:02.957
- Yeah, it was.
- I'm satisfied.

1:11:03.025 --> 1:11:04.392
Me, too.

1:11:18.007 --> 1:11:19.707
<i>[Julian] Irma started
her new job</i>

1:11:19.709 --> 1:11:22.110
<i>and she couldn't take off today,</i>

1:11:22.112 --> 1:11:23.077
<i>so I'm having to go
to Dr. Now's</i>

1:11:23.079 --> 1:11:25.079
<i>on my own today.</i>

1:11:26.048 --> 1:11:27.749
<i>And I'm excited for myself</i>

1:11:27.751 --> 1:11:29.350
because I can finally
drive again!

1:11:30.052 --> 1:11:30.918
<i>And it feels good.</i>

1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:34.422
It feels good to be
behind this wheel.

1:11:36.525 --> 1:11:38.860
<i>It's been going on
eight or nine years</i>

1:11:38.862 --> 1:11:40.695
<i>since I've been able to fit
behind the wheel</i>

1:11:40.697 --> 1:11:41.629
<i>and I feel good.</i>

1:11:41.631 --> 1:11:42.797
<i>But I'm still nervous</i>

1:11:42.799 --> 1:11:45.767
<i>because I don't know
where my final progress is at.</i>

1:11:45.769 --> 1:11:47.502
<i>But I know I'm lower
with my weight</i>

1:11:47.504 --> 1:11:50.038
<i>than I've been in a long time.</i>

1:11:54.009 --> 1:11:56.944
<i>And I've been working my
hardest to get back on track.</i>

1:11:57.980 --> 1:11:58.946
[sighs]

1:11:58.948 --> 1:11:59.647
<i>And I'm hoping</i>

1:11:59.649 --> 1:12:01.482
<i>that's been enough for me</i>

1:12:01.484 --> 1:12:04.085
<i>to finally be approved
for weight loss surgery.</i>

1:12:05.054 --> 1:12:07.789
<i>The last time I was here
two months ago,</i>

1:12:07.791 --> 1:12:09.824
<i>the scale said I was 792</i>

1:12:09.826 --> 1:12:11.859
<i>and Dr. Now told me my goal</i>

1:12:11.861 --> 1:12:14.295
<i>was to lose 100 pounds
from that.</i>

1:12:16.231 --> 1:12:19.233
<i>That means I need to be
down to 692 today.</i>

1:12:26.842 --> 1:12:27.775
Julian?

1:12:27.777 --> 1:12:29.243
[anticipatory music]

1:12:38.721 --> 1:12:40.221
[nurse] We can step up
on the scale.

1:12:52.401 --> 1:12:54.369
Your weight is 705.

1:12:56.305 --> 1:12:57.405
Thank you.

1:12:59.041 --> 1:13:01.376
<i>That's a big loss,
and I feel good about that.</i>

1:13:01.577 --> 1:13:02.810
<i>But I'm still nervous</i>

1:13:02.812 --> 1:13:06.047
<i>because this appointment
can go one way or another.</i>

1:13:09.051 --> 1:13:11.586
<i>You know, Dr. Now
could either see this amount</i>

1:13:11.588 --> 1:13:13.321
<i>as a positive or a failure.</i>

1:13:15.524 --> 1:13:17.792
<i>So I'm just nervous
because I'm not sure</i>

1:13:17.794 --> 1:13:19.394
<i>how this is gonna go
and what's gonna happen.</i>

1:13:20.929 --> 1:13:22.230
[knocking on door]

1:13:23.899 --> 1:13:25.900
- Hello.
- Hey, Dr. Now.

1:13:25.902 --> 1:13:27.869
Hi, Julian.
How are you?

1:13:27.871 --> 1:13:29.003
I'm doing good, and yourself?

1:13:29.405 --> 1:13:30.405
Good.

1:13:30.407 --> 1:13:33.574
All right, so,
where's Irma today?

1:13:33.576 --> 1:13:34.942
She had to work.

1:13:34.944 --> 1:13:37.311
So she miss your big
weight loss, huh?

1:13:37.313 --> 1:13:38.880
Mm-hmm.

1:13:38.882 --> 1:13:41.949
All right. And the last time, you
gained a little over 70 pounds.

1:13:41.951 --> 1:13:43.684
So I was a little bit concerned,

1:13:43.686 --> 1:13:44.986
but this time it looks like

1:13:44.988 --> 1:13:46.821
you lost almost 100 pounds, huh?

1:13:46.823 --> 1:13:49.657
Yeah, I guess I'm doing
something right.

1:13:49.659 --> 1:13:52.126
Well, you still need
to get back more.

1:13:52.128 --> 1:13:54.695
At your weight,
you should be losing more

1:13:54.697 --> 1:13:55.863
if you're doing the diet.

1:13:55.865 --> 1:13:57.832
But 90 pounds is a good loss

1:13:57.834 --> 1:14:00.034
and shows me
you're back on track.

1:14:00.036 --> 1:14:02.303
And since you're doing better

1:14:02.305 --> 1:14:03.538
and you're losing some weight,

1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:05.940
I'm gonna go ahead and approve
you for weight-loss surgery.

1:14:05.942 --> 1:14:08.876
- Thank you.
- But I want you to stick with the diet.

1:14:08.878 --> 1:14:10.978
And I'm gonna schedule
your surgery

1:14:10.980 --> 1:14:12.413
for one month from now.

1:14:12.415 --> 1:14:13.848
And at that time,

1:14:13.850 --> 1:14:15.716
I want you to lose
30 more pounds

1:14:15.718 --> 1:14:17.885
- Okay?
- All right. Yes, sir.

1:14:17.887 --> 1:14:18.752
If you don't do that,

1:14:18.754 --> 1:14:20.388
we're not gonna
move ahead with you

1:14:20.390 --> 1:14:22.990
because the last time
we made good progress,

1:14:22.992 --> 1:14:26.027
you went back
to overeating right after.

1:14:26.029 --> 1:14:27.829
So you need to show me

1:14:27.831 --> 1:14:30.031
you can stick with it
for a little longer.

1:14:30.033 --> 1:14:31.399
- Okay.
- Well...

1:14:31.401 --> 1:14:33.734
So far, you have lost
125 pounds.

1:14:33.736 --> 1:14:35.203
Yeah.

1:14:35.205 --> 1:14:38.406
So that's a pretty good effort that
you're doing with your eating habits.

1:14:38.408 --> 1:14:39.707
So keep it up

1:14:39.709 --> 1:14:41.809
and we're gonna see
what we can do with you, okay?

1:14:41.811 --> 1:14:42.910
All right, thank you.

1:14:42.912 --> 1:14:44.045
All right. I'll see you, then.

1:14:44.047 --> 1:14:46.013
- See you.
- Okay.

1:14:53.422 --> 1:14:55.089
<i>[Dr. Now] I'm proud of Julian</i>

1:14:55.091 --> 1:14:56.757
<i>for putting forward
the effort he has</i>

1:14:56.759 --> 1:14:57.959
over the past two months.

1:14:57.961 --> 1:15:00.495
<i>It's not quite
another 100 pounds,</i>

1:15:00.497 --> 1:15:02.663
<i>but it's close enough to show me</i>

1:15:02.665 --> 1:15:05.433
<i>he is willing to take back
some control of his life.</i>

1:15:05.435 --> 1:15:09.570
<i>And as long as he shows me he's
gonna stick with the changes he's made,</i>

1:15:09.572 --> 1:15:13.241
to lose another 30 pounds this
next month, and his tests look good,

1:15:13.243 --> 1:15:15.576
<i>then we will
move ahead with him.</i>

1:15:15.578 --> 1:15:20.681
<i>But if he repeats history, and start
to slip again, I will cancel his surgery.</i>

1:15:20.683 --> 1:15:25.820
<i>But Julian doesn't have any more
time to waste, risking his health.</i>

1:15:25.822 --> 1:15:29.423
So hopefully, he continues
to take his situation seriously,

1:15:29.425 --> 1:15:31.959
<i>to stay on track.</i>

1:15:31.961 --> 1:15:34.829
<i>[Julian] Irma's gonna be excited
to hear the news of my surgery.</i>

1:15:34.831 --> 1:15:37.198
<i>So I feel really good right now.</i>

1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:40.201
<i>You know, this time,
I'm not letting nothing</i>

1:15:40.203 --> 1:15:44.171
<i>lead me back
to the wrong direction,</i>

1:15:44.173 --> 1:15:48.242
<i>because I'm not letting anything
get to me, to where I lose this surgery.</i>

1:16:16.138 --> 1:16:19.574
<i>[Julian] I'm feeling good right
now. A little nervous, but good,</i>

1:16:19.576 --> 1:16:23.678
<i>because Dr. Now said he's moving
ahead with my weight-loss surgery today.</i>

1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:27.748
<i>I stayed on track enough this
month, and I'm finally in the 600s.</i>

1:16:27.750 --> 1:16:30.785
<i>And that feels good,
coming down from the 800s.</i>

1:16:30.787 --> 1:16:34.689
<i>So Dr. Now says I'm ready
for this, and I agree with him,</i>

1:16:34.691 --> 1:16:36.891
<i>because this has been
a long time coming.</i>

1:16:36.893 --> 1:16:40.061
<i>So I know
I'm very ready for this.</i>

1:16:40.063 --> 1:16:42.363
<i>[Irma] I think Julian's
gonna do very well,</i>

1:16:42.365 --> 1:16:44.465
<i>because he's stuck to his diet,</i>

1:16:44.467 --> 1:16:46.701
even though he was like, "Babe,
I'm so hungry. I'm so hungry.

1:16:46.703 --> 1:16:49.470
Like, I want to eat something."
I'm like, "Baby, well you can't.

1:16:49.472 --> 1:16:54.942
<i>You have to stick to it." And
he did, and I was surprised.</i>

1:16:54.944 --> 1:17:01.048
I did not think he was gonna
lose that much. But hey, he did it.

1:17:01.683 --> 1:17:04.385
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1:17:05.921 --> 1:17:08.723
<i>[Julian] I'm thankful for the
chance to take a step like this,</i>

1:17:08.725 --> 1:17:11.859
<i>so I can start
to get my life right.</i>

1:17:11.861 --> 1:17:14.662
<i>I wanted to be able to keep my
promises to Irma and my family,</i>

1:17:14.664 --> 1:17:16.897
<i>by losing the weight.</i>

1:17:16.899 --> 1:17:21.002
<i>And now I'm gonna finally have
the big tube to help me do that.</i>

1:17:21.004 --> 1:17:22.670
So I'm very happy right now,

1:17:22.672 --> 1:17:26.407
and I'm looking forward to the
life this is gonna help bring me.

1:17:26.409 --> 1:17:29.543
[nurse] All right, Julian.
This is your room.

1:17:29.545 --> 1:17:33.614
<i>[Dr. Now] Today, we are attempting
to do weight-loss surgery on Julian.</i>

1:17:33.616 --> 1:17:37.718
<i>But this is going to be a more
difficult operation than usual,</i>

1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:41.622
<i>because of the severe hernia
that Julian still has.</i>

1:17:41.624 --> 1:17:45.593
<i>And because he is still
at a very large size,</i>

1:17:45.595 --> 1:17:48.195
<i>so the first issue
we have to manage with him</i>

1:17:48.197 --> 1:17:51.399
<i>is securing him
safely on the table.</i>

1:17:53.769 --> 1:17:58.239
<i>Now that we have secured Julian
safely, we can begin the operation.</i>

1:17:58.241 --> 1:18:02.143
<i>But the second big issue
we have with him is his hernia,</i>

1:18:02.145 --> 1:18:06.047
<i>and whether it prevents us from
doing what we need, at any point.</i>

1:18:06.049 --> 1:18:07.581
Okay.

1:18:11.787 --> 1:18:15.790
<i>So first, I'm gonna attempt to
fix his hernia as best as possible.</i>

1:18:15.792 --> 1:18:16.724
[surgeon speaking]

1:18:16.726 --> 1:18:18.626
<i>[Dr. Now] Then,
I will move ahead,</i>

1:18:18.628 --> 1:18:23.030
<i>and attempt to do a gastric
sleeve procedure on him.</i>

1:18:25.934 --> 1:18:27.301
- All right, bring the robot.
- [nurse] Yes.

1:18:27.303 --> 1:18:30.638
<i>[Dr. Now] And if we are able
to complete that,</i>

1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:35.476
<i>then that will give Julian an important
tool to help him continue to lose weight.</i>

1:18:35.478 --> 1:18:40.815
Because what the surgery does
is reduce the stomach by 90%,

1:18:40.817 --> 1:18:45.820
<i>leaving a small narrow tube
that looks similar to a sleeve.</i>

1:18:45.822 --> 1:18:49.356
So the patient's food intake
is physically limited.

1:18:49.358 --> 1:18:52.426
<i>And the patient is less hungry.</i>

1:18:52.428 --> 1:18:57.331
So this operation will give them an
opportunity to lose even more weight.

1:18:57.333 --> 1:19:01.102
<i>So this will be a big help
to keep Julian on track</i>

1:19:01.104 --> 1:19:05.439
<i>while we work with him to get him to
where he is able to maintain his progress</i>

1:19:05.441 --> 1:19:07.074
<i>for the long-term.</i>

1:19:07.576 --> 1:19:12.379
<i>But my concern right now is not
having enough time to do both surgeries.</i>

1:19:12.381 --> 1:19:15.683
<i>If the situation
with his hernia is too severe,</i>

1:19:15.685 --> 1:19:18.385
<i>because at his weight,
this is a high-risk surgery,</i>

1:19:18.387 --> 1:19:23.057
<i>and because of that, we want to
limit the time he is under anesthesia.</i>

1:19:23.059 --> 1:19:26.393
<i>Because it could start to put
too much strain on his system,</i>

1:19:26.395 --> 1:19:28.696
<i>if we keep him under too long.</i>

1:19:28.698 --> 1:19:33.334
<i>So we'll have to see what's
possible to do safely with him today.</i>

1:19:33.336 --> 1:19:36.170
<i>His hernia is extremely severe.</i>

1:19:36.172 --> 1:19:39.740
<i>There is a lot of mess from
a previous repair that failed,</i>

1:19:39.742 --> 1:19:41.475
<i>and there is
a lot of pressure on it,</i>

1:19:41.477 --> 1:19:44.612
<i>from all the weight
Julian still has on his body.</i>

1:19:44.614 --> 1:19:48.449
<i>So to repair it fully
and do the gastric sleeve</i>

1:19:48.451 --> 1:19:50.851
<i>is gonna keep him
under anesthesia too long.</i>

1:19:50.853 --> 1:19:54.622
<i>So I'm gonna have to do a
partial repair of the hernia,</i>

1:19:54.624 --> 1:19:57.625
<i>and then move on
to perform the gastric sleeve,</i>

1:19:57.627 --> 1:20:02.363
<i>to prevent Julian's body from
being pushed to any limits.</i>

1:20:02.365 --> 1:20:06.867
<i>Because, at his weight, that
would be a very dangerous situation.</i>

1:20:06.869 --> 1:20:10.704
<i>Okay, I've finished a
partial repair of the hernia,</i>

1:20:10.706 --> 1:20:14.041
<i>So now I'm gonna
complete the sleeve.</i>

1:20:19.881 --> 1:20:24.218
<i>All right, we are almost done
removing his stomach.</i>

1:20:26.955 --> 1:20:29.590
<i>[Irma] I'm feeling tired,
I'm feeling worried.</i>

1:20:29.592 --> 1:20:32.393
<i>Mostly worried than tired.</i>

1:20:32.395 --> 1:20:36.697
They've been updating me
every hour, to see how he's doing.

1:20:36.699 --> 1:20:39.733
Um, and I guess
they did find the hernia,

1:20:39.735 --> 1:20:42.403
but I don't know if they
actually repaired it yet or not.

1:20:42.405 --> 1:20:46.407
Um, and yeah.
I've been waiting here.

1:20:47.943 --> 1:20:53.147
<i>I feel nervous, because, like, I don't
know how he's doing in there, and...</i>

1:20:54.015 --> 1:20:55.916
<i>I'm very anxious to see Julian,</i>

1:20:55.918 --> 1:20:58.252
<i>because that's the only way
I'm gonna know that he's okay.</i>

1:21:12.167 --> 1:21:14.168
[equipment beeping]

1:21:17.172 --> 1:21:19.406
What a long stomach.

1:21:35.790 --> 1:21:38.025
Okay, all finished.

1:21:40.262 --> 1:21:41.896
Julian's surgery went very well.

1:21:41.898 --> 1:21:46.767
It was challenging, because he
has a, that big hernia was in the way.

1:21:46.769 --> 1:21:49.303
So we have to get
a lot of adhesion done,

1:21:49.305 --> 1:21:54.408
and get the pipe to the stomach,
and be able to do surgery.

1:21:54.410 --> 1:21:57.711
<i>So it was more complicated
than usual, with all his issues,</i>

1:21:57.713 --> 1:22:00.748
<i>but we managed to get
the sleeve gastrectomy done,</i>

1:22:00.750 --> 1:22:03.617
<i>and we will finish his
hernia repair down the road,</i>

1:22:03.619 --> 1:22:05.152
<i>after he has lost more weight.</i>

1:22:05.154 --> 1:22:07.755
<i>But this will be
a big help for Julian,</i>

1:22:07.757 --> 1:22:11.825
<i>to help keep him on track with his
weight loss, while we work with him,</i>

1:22:11.827 --> 1:22:13.294
<i>and get him to where
he will be able</i>

1:22:13.296 --> 1:22:15.930
<i>to maintain healthy weight
for the long-term.</i>

1:22:15.932 --> 1:22:19.400
<i>Right now, he'll be on a
liquid diet for the next month.</i>

1:22:19.402 --> 1:22:22.803
<i>And he should be able to lose
another 40 pounds in that time.</i>

1:22:22.805 --> 1:22:28.208
Then he should be able to lose
between 25 to 30 pounds a month,

1:22:28.210 --> 1:22:30.678
<i>until he starts to get closer
to his target weight.</i>

1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:33.614
<i>But overall,
I think Julian has done well.</i>

1:22:33.616 --> 1:22:36.583
<i>And I'm optimistic that we
will be able to work with him,</i>

1:22:36.585 --> 1:22:40.254
<i>to get him to his target
weight over the next year.</i>

1:22:40.256 --> 1:22:44.692
And in a place where he will be
able to maintain that for the long-term.

1:22:44.694 --> 1:22:48.195
[groans softly]

1:22:49.030 --> 1:22:52.132
[optimistic guitar music plays]

1:23:00.976 --> 1:23:04.044
I'm so excited
that we can go out.

1:23:04.112 --> 1:23:06.981
It's been years.

1:23:07.515 --> 1:23:09.750
Years since you took me out.

1:23:09.752 --> 1:23:11.785
<i>[Julian] Me and Irma
are going out tonight.</i>

1:23:11.787 --> 1:23:15.122
<i>And with all
my progress, I'm ready.</i>

1:23:15.824 --> 1:23:18.592
<i>So we're gonna go to a dinner
and a movie tonight,</i>

1:23:18.594 --> 1:23:20.961
<i>and finally have a normal date.</i>

1:23:22.497 --> 1:23:26.000
You always look pretty, baby.
Even without makeup.

1:23:26.701 --> 1:23:28.869
Are you driving? Please
tell me you're driving, please.

1:23:28.871 --> 1:23:32.740
- Yeah, I'll drive.
- Here, help me with this.

1:23:32.742 --> 1:23:35.042
<i>[Julian] The weight is starting
to come off fast right now,</i>

1:23:35.044 --> 1:23:37.277
<i>so I'm excited about that.</i>

1:23:37.912 --> 1:23:38.479
<i>And I know I'm still big.</i>

1:23:38.481 --> 1:23:40.147
[sighs] Let's go.

1:23:40.448 --> 1:23:44.518
<i>And I'm still worried about fitting
into the same places other people can.</i>

1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:49.356
<i>But with all I've lost, I'm feeling
better about how I'm doing.</i>

1:23:51.693 --> 1:23:55.396
<i>So I'm excited about that, and
I'm gonna keep working hard,</i>

1:23:55.398 --> 1:23:57.331
<i>because I don't wanna slow down.</i>

1:24:01.836 --> 1:24:03.003
Thank you.

1:24:07.409 --> 1:24:09.076
You're welcome, baby.

1:24:12.781 --> 1:24:15.482
<i>This past year has had
a lot of trials in it,</i>

1:24:15.484 --> 1:24:18.886
<i>and there was moments I
wasn't sure about doing this.</i>

1:24:18.888 --> 1:24:23.924
<i>But I'm so thankful that Irma kept
pushing me forwards, so I didn't quit.</i>

1:24:23.926 --> 1:24:25.526
- [Irma] Thank you.
- [Waiter] Thank you.

1:24:25.528 --> 1:24:27.494
Oh, wow.

1:24:27.496 --> 1:24:30.030
<i>[Julian] But now I'm looking at a
life where I can take my wife out.</i>

1:24:30.032 --> 1:24:33.300
I was really sceptical
that we're gonna be this good.

1:24:36.204 --> 1:24:37.838
<i>[man] Here you go.</i>

1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:40.974
<i>- Theatre two, second door on the left.
- [Irma] Thank you so much.</i>

1:24:41.976 --> 1:24:44.378
- [exhales] Is it good?
- Yeah, it's good.

1:24:44.380 --> 1:24:46.880
- Good. Okay.
- This is good.

1:24:46.882 --> 1:24:49.283
<i>And I can go out, on
my own, and get a job,</i>

1:24:49.285 --> 1:24:52.686
<i>and start taking care of things.</i>

1:24:52.688 --> 1:24:57.224
<i>But the biggest thing is, this is gonna
give us a chance to start a family.</i>

1:24:59.761 --> 1:25:01.895
<i>I would do anything
for that to happen.</i>

1:25:01.897 --> 1:25:04.565
<i>But whatever the future
has in store for us...</i>

1:25:04.567 --> 1:25:08.402
<i>I'm excited to be able
to do more.</i>

1:25:08.404 --> 1:25:13.407
<i>And sharing things with Irma, and
have a life I get to enjoy with her.</i>

1:25:13.409 --> 1:25:16.710
<i>So I'm gonna keep my focus,
and keep working hard</i>

1:25:16.712 --> 1:25:22.082
<i>so I can make her happy by
being the husband she deserves.</i>

1:25:22.084 --> 1:25:24.384
<i>And I'm looking forward
to being able to do that.</i>
