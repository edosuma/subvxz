01:52.602 --> 01:54.802
Hi, Eddie.
- Hiya, Scotty.

01:54.961 --> 01:58.384
Cold enough for you?
- Well, I'm only faintly alive. It's 25 below.

01:58.484 --> 02:00.824
You know everybody?
- We haven't met.

02:00.924 --> 02:01.945
McPherson.
- Hi.

02:02.045 --> 02:04.584
Ned Scott, Capt. Hendry.
Scotty just got in today.

02:04.684 --> 02:05.824
Hi, care to join us?

02:05.925 --> 02:08.545
Wait till I count my fingers.
I may have lost one.

02:08.645 --> 02:12.986
Scotty's a warm-weather man. We met
at Accra. Quite a spot. 105 in the shade...

02:13.086 --> 02:16.267
...and the women hardly wore
anything at all. Very intelligent of them.

02:16.367 --> 02:19.267
You just lie there in a hammock
while three of them fan you.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.029
Remember, Scotty?
- I remember.

02:21.129 --> 02:24.628
Oh, boy. When I die I hope I go to Accra.
- I was there.

02:24.729 --> 02:25.749
I'm in.

02:25.849 --> 02:28.550
What are you doing here, Mr. Scott?
- Looking for a story.

02:28.650 --> 02:30.110
Scotty's a newspaperman.

02:30.210 --> 02:32.210
How many?
- Three.

02:33.012 --> 02:35.132
Cards?
- I'll play these.

02:35.292 --> 02:37.612
Caught from ambush.
- Check.

02:38.133 --> 02:42.013
Well, I'll bet a buck.
- And I'll fold.

02:42.172 --> 02:43.234
Call.

02:43.334 --> 02:46.395
Pair of queens.
- I thought so. Aces.

02:46.414 --> 02:49.516
You ought to know better than to try
fooling our captain. Only dames can do that.

02:49.616 --> 02:51.596
Lt. Dykes, I promise...
- Slip of the tongue.

02:51.696 --> 02:56.036
What do you hear from the general?
- Fogarty's nursing secrets like a June bride.

02:56.136 --> 02:59.197
I got an idea. A guy in Seattle
knows a whole radar defense story...

02:59.296 --> 03:00.918
...loves to talk.
General McLaren.

03:01.019 --> 03:04.678
Tell General Fogarty you want to go
to Seattle, and Pat and I will fly you there.

03:04.778 --> 03:06.079
I met General McLaren too.

03:06.178 --> 03:09.560
It's warm in Seattle. They got girls
there without fur pants on.

03:09.661 --> 03:11.839
What about it, captain?
- That could be right.

03:11.940 --> 03:14.840
You won't be able to shoo our captain
southward with his heart...

03:14.941 --> 03:17.041
...wrapped around the North Pole.
- That'll do.

03:17.141 --> 03:20.122
What's going on up there?
- Scientists are holding a convention.

03:20.223 --> 03:22.884
Looking for polar bear tails.
- Ever hear of Dr. Carrington?

03:22.983 --> 03:24.804
The fellow who was at Bikini?
- The same.

03:24.904 --> 03:27.684
They're holding about 2000 miles
north of here. A whole bunch.

03:27.785 --> 03:30.484
Botanists, physicists, electronic...
- Including a pin-up girl.

03:30.584 --> 03:32.284
Very interesting type too.
- Very.

03:32.385 --> 03:34.566
Capt. Hendry can give you any data on her.

03:34.667 --> 03:37.326
You probably shouldn't have said that.
- Well, after I read...

03:37.426 --> 03:38.726
Now look!

03:38.826 --> 03:42.687
Someday I hope to have a navigator and a
copilot who are at least dry behind the ears.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.689
Oh, captain.
- You mail-order...

03:44.788 --> 03:48.728
Capt. Hendry, report to General Fogarty's
quarters at once please.

03:48.829 --> 03:52.689
8:00 at night and the general yelling
for his troops. Sounds like the old days.

03:52.790 --> 03:54.369
Take my hand. Will you?
- Yeah.

03:54.470 --> 03:57.771
Captain, if it amounts to anything,
bring me in on it. Will you, please?

03:57.871 --> 03:59.411
Sure.

03:59.511 --> 04:02.193
I gotta get a story someplace.

04:04.793 --> 04:06.794
Come in.

04:07.753 --> 04:10.315
Close the door.
- Yes, sir.

04:15.474 --> 04:17.495
Good evening, sir.
- Didn't take you long.

04:17.596 --> 04:19.016
Not many places to hide, sir.

04:19.115 --> 04:23.498
Just got a queer message from your picnic
party up north, from Dr. Carrington himself.

04:23.598 --> 04:26.978
'Believe an airplane unusual type
crashed in our vicinity.

04:27.078 --> 04:29.737
Please send facilities to investigate.
Most urgent.'

04:29.837 --> 04:32.618
What would you find up there
besides a good-looking girl?

04:32.718 --> 04:34.660
I don't know, sir. Any ships missing?
- No.

04:34.761 --> 04:36.701
No Canadians either.
- Could be Russians.

04:36.801 --> 04:39.340
They're all over the pole like flies.
- You're going.

04:39.439 --> 04:42.900
Take along a dog team or anything
you might need for rescue.

04:43.001 --> 04:44.502
Come in.

04:44.603 --> 04:45.822
Close the door!

04:45.922 --> 04:49.102
You suppose the Pentagon
could send us a revolving door?

04:49.202 --> 04:51.743
Could be, sir. We got pith helmets
last week.

04:51.843 --> 04:53.742
Weather report, sir.
- Okay, that's all.

04:53.843 --> 04:57.826
If any messages come in from Dr. Carrington,
I want to be notified personally.

04:57.926 --> 04:59.665
No matter what the time.
- Yes, sir.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.947
Here's your weather.
There's a front moving in...

05:02.046 --> 05:04.267
...but you ought to have time
to get there and back.

05:04.367 --> 05:06.828
General, that newspaperman, Scott...
- What about him?

05:06.928 --> 05:09.827
He'd like to go with us.
- It's all right if you maroon him up there.

05:09.927 --> 05:12.188
Don't get me wrong
about who gets marooned.

05:12.288 --> 05:14.907
I'd like it if you didn't smash
into the landing ski this time.

05:15.008 --> 05:16.590
That was an unavoidable accident.

05:16.811 --> 05:18.913
Well, look, I'll expect you back
tomorrow night.

05:19.013 --> 05:22.476
Yes, sir. And I'll close the door.
- Just tell me what you find up there.

05:22.575 --> 05:25.723
No one tells me anything around here.

05:39.428 --> 05:40.691
Want some coffee?

05:40.790 --> 05:43.513
Hey, thanks.
- Here you are, sir.

05:51.359 --> 05:54.001
Mr. Scott. Coffee.

05:54.282 --> 05:58.450
Are we there?
- No, sir. Hot coffee up front, sir.

05:59.687 --> 06:03.770
Lieutenant? Coffee, sir.
- Thank you, stewardess.

06:04.491 --> 06:06.934
Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

06:07.213 --> 06:09.536
How far are we from camp?

06:09.695 --> 06:12.157
Three hours. We've slowed down.
A little headwind.

06:12.258 --> 06:15.160
A little headwind?
Close to 40 miles.

06:15.260 --> 06:17.721
Our captain has some funny ideas
about the North Pole.

06:17.822 --> 06:20.404
He thinks it's a garden spot.
Come and bring the kiddies.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.365
Now look, don't you two guys start.

06:22.466 --> 06:27.049
You know, Perry went to the North Pole
once. He retired with a sack full of medals.

06:27.148 --> 06:28.170
Hey, Pat.

06:28.270 --> 06:31.014
We go there every three weeks
just like it was lover's lane.

06:31.114 --> 06:33.934
Mr. Scott, some people
seem to think... Wait a minute.

06:34.034 --> 06:38.899
Hello, Air Force 191 from
Polar Expedition 6. Can you read me?

06:38.999 --> 06:41.780
Air Force 191. Hear you fine, Tex.
Go ahead.

06:41.881 --> 06:44.544
What's your position?
- Three hours out.

06:44.644 --> 06:49.188
Captain, switch over to your radio compass.
Check it against your magnetic heading.

06:49.288 --> 06:50.509
What's on your mind, Tex?

06:50.609 --> 06:53.952
We've got some disturbance up here.
It's whacking away at everything.

06:54.051 --> 06:57.315
What do you figure it's from?
- Don't know. We noticed it last night.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.517
Six to eight degrees difference.
- We're quite a bit off here, Tex.

07:00.617 --> 07:02.799
You better home in on me.
I'll leave the key open.

07:02.899 --> 07:06.163
Or would you rather have me sing to you?
- Leave the key open.

07:06.262 --> 07:08.645
I was afraid you'd say that.

07:24.879 --> 07:28.026
Hey, the taxpayers ought to see this.

08:52.149 --> 08:53.850
Hello, doctor, professor.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.234
Still the same game?
- Yes.

08:56.392 --> 08:57.734
Hello, boys.

08:57.834 --> 09:02.298
Doctor, professor. Here's your mail.
- You're just in time for lunch.

09:02.398 --> 09:05.823
Ken, I bet you forgot my hairpins.
- Don't tell me I'm nearly at the North Pole.

09:05.922 --> 09:08.503
Looks more like my Kentucky home.
- Mr. Scott, Mrs. Chapman.

09:08.603 --> 09:10.984
A pleasure, Mrs. Chapman.
- Hi, nice to see you.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.268
Dr. Chapman, Mr. Scott.
- Dr. Chapman.

09:13.368 --> 09:15.989
Scotty's a newspaperman.
- You've come at an opportune time.

09:16.090 --> 09:19.913
I happened to be in Anchorage when your
message came. I hope you have a good story.

09:20.014 --> 09:22.195
No more than you know already.
- Nothing more at all?

09:22.295 --> 09:25.359
Just discussions as to what it might be.
We all have different ideas.

09:25.459 --> 09:27.878
There's been arguments about it.
- Where's Dr. Carrington?

09:27.979 --> 09:29.282
In the lab.
- See you later.

09:29.382 --> 09:31.202
Does that mean you've seen the plane?

09:31.303 --> 09:32.644
Coffee, captain?
- No, thanks.

09:32.744 --> 09:34.444
Our captain seems in a hurry, Lee.

09:34.545 --> 09:36.446
Where are you two going?
- We're with you.

09:36.547 --> 09:40.171
We want to tell her she treated you badly.
- If you don't want us to go...

09:40.271 --> 09:45.461
I'm gonna get even with you two someday.
- We got up in there.

09:51.571 --> 09:53.573
Come in.

09:53.894 --> 09:57.808
Hi, Pat. Welcome to our igloo.
How was your...?

09:59.219 --> 10:00.921
Well...

10:01.022 --> 10:04.824
How was your trip?
- All right. About usual.

10:05.306 --> 10:06.486
Well, that's fine.

10:06.586 --> 10:10.572
I think Dr. Carrington wants to see you.
- He can wait. I wanna talk to you.

10:10.672 --> 10:12.693
What about?
- That was a dirty trick you played.

10:12.793 --> 10:15.816
Don't lose your temper.
- Why did you do it? Just tell me why.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.140
Well, your legs aren't very pretty.

10:18.241 --> 10:21.182
You didn't have to write a note
and put it on my chest.

10:21.282 --> 10:22.303
I'm sorry, Pat...

10:22.403 --> 10:25.509
Six people read it before I woke up.
Now the whole Air Force knows.

10:25.609 --> 10:27.831
Not so loud. They'll hear.
- They already heard.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.873
The only place it hasn't been
is on a billboard.

10:29.972 --> 10:33.546
I didn't know you had such a nasty temper.

10:33.577 --> 10:36.080
Now, Pat, just be careful.
Now take it easy.

10:36.179 --> 10:38.182
Now wait a minute.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.525
We had a lot of fun when you were up here.

10:40.626 --> 10:43.528
Then when you asked me down
to Anchorage, you deliberately fed me...

10:43.629 --> 10:45.811
Tell me, did you really drink
all those drinks?

10:45.912 --> 10:48.294
You didn't throw any away? Not one?
- No.

10:48.394 --> 10:50.695
Holy cat. I thought I was good.

10:50.794 --> 10:52.739
And another thing, why did you leave?

10:52.838 --> 10:54.820
When I woke up in the morning
you were gone.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.343
I told you I had to take
that cargo plane back here.

10:57.443 --> 10:59.103
You told me?
- Don't you remember?

10:59.204 --> 11:01.026
No.

11:01.127 --> 11:05.313
Right after dinner. You were telling
me all about a night in San Francisco...

11:05.413 --> 11:07.416
Did I tell you that?

11:09.015 --> 11:10.399
What else did I do?

11:10.499 --> 11:13.842
Well, you had moments
of kind of making like an octopus.

11:13.942 --> 11:19.389
I never saw so many hands in all my life.
- All right. All right.

11:19.548 --> 11:22.011
Look, my only excuse is that I liked you...

11:22.110 --> 11:23.412
...right away.

11:23.512 --> 11:27.898
So I started wrong. Can't we begin again?
- How would you begin?

11:27.998 --> 11:30.901
Well, I can think of several...
- Never mind.

11:31.001 --> 11:33.142
We don't have time for that now anyway.

11:33.242 --> 11:36.901
I know Dr. Carrington's waiting to see you.

11:40.972 --> 11:46.439
What about this business of starting over?
- We'll talk about that later.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.176
Hello, captain.
- Hi, professor.

12:00.312 --> 12:04.378
Dr. Carrington, Capt. Hendry is here.
- Yes, I know.

12:04.478 --> 12:06.340
How do you do, captain?
- Doctor.

12:06.439 --> 12:08.742
Miss Nicholson, would you add
a note to the others?

12:08.843 --> 12:09.984
Surely.

12:10.083 --> 12:13.968
November 2, 11:30 A.M.

12:14.169 --> 12:18.954
Deviation in sector 19 continues
12 degrees, 20 minutes east.

12:19.055 --> 12:22.518
No lessening or wavering
of disturbing element.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.620
That's all.

12:24.941 --> 12:27.763
Captain, can we start now?
- Mind telling me where we're going?

12:27.863 --> 12:29.205
48 miles due east from here.

12:29.305 --> 12:32.529
Your message said an airplane crashed.
Is that what we're looking for?

12:32.630 --> 12:33.689
I don't know, captain.

12:33.789 --> 12:35.692
I think you better explain.
- I'm sorry.

12:35.792 --> 12:38.536
Miss Nicholson, would you read
Capt. Hendry my first notes?

12:38.636 --> 12:42.981
I was thinking only of the vagueness
of my information. I dislike being vague.

12:43.081 --> 12:44.783
'November 1st...
- Yesterday.

12:44.883 --> 12:49.787
...6:15 P.M. Sound detectors and
seismographs registered explosion due east.

12:49.887 --> 12:53.832
At 6:18, magnetometer revealed deviation
12 degrees, 20 minutes east.'

12:53.932 --> 12:57.076
That deviation has been constant.
- We ran into it before we got here.

12:57.176 --> 13:00.079
'Such deviation possible only
if a disturbing force equivalent...

13:00.179 --> 13:03.523
...to 20,000 tons of steel or iron ore...
- 20,000 tons?

13:03.624 --> 13:06.447
...had become part of the earth
at about a 50-mile radius.'

13:06.547 --> 13:09.090
You're getting a bit beyond me,
but it sounds like a meteor.

13:09.190 --> 13:11.933
Yes, very much. Except for one thing.

13:12.033 --> 13:14.615
Will, show it to Capt. Hendry.
- Yes, sir.

13:14.714 --> 13:17.700
We have some special telescopic cameras.

13:17.799 --> 13:20.783
On the appearance of radioactivity,
a Geiger counter trips the release...

13:20.883 --> 13:22.545
...and the cameras function.

13:22.645 --> 13:26.900
They were working last evening.
This is the result.

13:28.772 --> 13:32.156
This first picture was taken
three minutes before the explosion...

13:32.256 --> 13:33.397
...or 6:12.

13:33.496 --> 13:37.561
You can see the small dot
below there in the corner.

13:37.661 --> 13:41.245
On the next picture, one minute later,
that dot is moving from west to east...

13:41.345 --> 13:44.049
...fast enough to form a streak.
- What shutter speed is it?

13:44.149 --> 13:47.692
1000th of a second.
- Moving pretty fast. Wasn't it?

13:47.792 --> 13:50.995
Here, at 6:14, it's moving upward.

13:52.357 --> 13:56.081
6:15, it drops to the earth and vanishes.

13:56.882 --> 14:00.306
A meteor might move almost horizontal
to the earth but never upward.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.268
Then it isn't a meteor.
- That's obvious.

14:02.368 --> 14:04.191
How'd you find the distance of impact?

14:04.493 --> 14:06.408
By computation...
- Dr. Carrington?

14:06.508 --> 14:08.702
Ready?
- It's quite simple, captain.

14:08.803 --> 14:12.330
We have the time of arrival
of the sound waves and detectors.

14:12.431 --> 14:15.833
And also the arrival time
of the impact waves on the seismograph.

14:15.934 --> 14:20.387
By computing the difference, it becomes
obvious they were caused by the object.

14:20.488 --> 14:23.730
The distance from here is 48 miles.
- I'll take your word for it.

14:23.831 --> 14:27.759
One thing, doctor. 20,000 tons of steel
is a lot of metal for an airplane.

14:27.860 --> 14:31.103
It is for the sort of airplane
we know, captain.

14:31.205 --> 14:35.051
Yeah, we'd better be going.
- Redding will check every quarter-hour.

14:35.152 --> 14:37.871
Will you want me, doctor?
- It won't be necessary.

14:37.972 --> 14:41.140
You come with us, Bill.
- Yes, doctor.

14:54.248 --> 14:56.847
We'll be there pretty soon now, Pat.

14:56.948 --> 14:59.566
Bob, get Carrington up here.

14:59.928 --> 15:01.942
Doctor!

15:07.141 --> 15:08.972
We're almost 50 miles out, doctor.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.833
With your compass deviation,
how are you navigating, captain?

15:11.933 --> 15:14.211
That peak ahead is practically due east.

15:14.311 --> 15:16.104
We got the wind before we left camp.

15:16.204 --> 15:19.045
Very good, captain.
- We should be there about now, Pat.

15:19.145 --> 15:23.535
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.

15:23.699 --> 15:26.095
Picking up something
on the Geiger counter, sir.

15:26.195 --> 15:30.224
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

15:30.425 --> 15:32.440
Look there.

15:35.420 --> 15:40.128
Pat, the compass is in a spin.
- Geiger's up to the top.

15:41.385 --> 15:43.696
Yeah, that's it, all right.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.663
You see someplace to set down?
- Looked smooth about a half a mile back.

15:49.763 --> 15:52.160
We'll take a look. Bob!
Get them ready. It might be rough.

15:52.261 --> 15:53.572
Right, sir.

15:53.672 --> 15:56.270
Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.
We're gonna land.

15:56.370 --> 15:59.109
Sit down and hold on back there.

16:02.937 --> 16:05.077
All set for landing, sir.

16:11.478 --> 16:13.493
Half flaps.

16:13.815 --> 16:16.433
Full rich.
- Full rich.

16:16.594 --> 16:18.609
Half flaps.

17:05.786 --> 17:07.094
There we are.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.792
Holy cat! What a weird-looking thing.

17:09.894 --> 17:12.492
Let me get a picture
before you track up the whole place.

17:12.593 --> 17:14.223
This Geiger counter is going crazy.

17:14.326 --> 17:17.609
Something's melted that surface crust.
It's frozen over again into clear ice.

17:17.711 --> 17:20.992
The bottle shape apparently was caused
by the craft first making contact...

17:21.094 --> 17:23.088
...with the earth out
at the neck of the bottle...

17:23.188 --> 17:26.632
...sliding toward us and forming
that larger area as it came to rest.

17:26.733 --> 17:31.307
With the engines generating enough heat
to melt that path through the crust...

17:31.407 --> 17:33.803
...then sink beneath the surface.
- What could melt that much ice?

17:33.904 --> 17:36.472
Let's go down and see. Barnes.

17:38.257 --> 17:40.996
Take the dogs over on that side.

17:48.610 --> 17:52.174
Dr. Chapman, could an airplane
melt that much ice?

17:52.275 --> 17:58.782
One of our own jets generates enough heat
to warm a 50-story office building.

18:07.142 --> 18:11.029
It's part of an airfoil. Probably a stabilizer.
- It's an airplane, all right.

18:11.130 --> 18:13.729
Can you tell what metal that is?
- I'll need some tools.

18:13.830 --> 18:16.044
Barnes, bring some tools!

18:19.431 --> 18:23.438
Hey, it's down pretty deep over here.
I can't see anything but a dark mass.

18:23.538 --> 18:24.686
It's deeper over here.

18:24.788 --> 18:28.998
Captain, may I suggest that we spread out
and try to determine the size and shape.

18:29.099 --> 18:33.389
Right. Spread out, everybody! We're gonna
try to figure out the shape of this thing.

18:33.489 --> 18:35.504
Here's the tools, sir.

18:47.947 --> 18:49.788
Holy cat!

18:49.888 --> 18:51.909
Hey...

18:52.232 --> 18:54.070
It's almost...

18:54.173 --> 18:57.243
Yeah. Almost a perfect...

18:57.445 --> 19:00.395
It is. It's round.

19:01.648 --> 19:04.618
We finally got one.
- We found a flying saucer!

19:04.719 --> 19:07.041
Can anybody see anything through the ice?

19:07.144 --> 19:09.387
Only an outline.
- Nothing but a dark shape.

19:09.488 --> 19:11.773
Seems perfectly smooth.
No doors or windows.

19:11.874 --> 19:15.168
I can't see any engine.
- I doubt we find anything we call an engine.

19:15.268 --> 19:19.046
Dr. Carrington, this isn't any metal I know.

19:19.167 --> 19:20.985
Probably some new alloy.

19:21.086 --> 19:24.315
Get some filings for analysis.
- Right.

19:24.604 --> 19:28.424
Captain, I don't think we have a chance
of chopping through the ice with axes.

19:28.524 --> 19:31.464
I know. We think so too.
We'll try to melt it out with thermite bombs.

19:31.563 --> 19:33.702
Oh, excellent.
- Where do you figure it's from?

19:33.801 --> 19:35.021
I don't know, Mr. Scott.

19:35.121 --> 19:36.781
Well, from this planet?
- I doubt it.

19:36.882 --> 19:39.541
Well, do you...?
- The answers will be much easier...

19:39.640 --> 19:42.337
...after we've examined the interior
of the aircraft...

19:42.437 --> 19:46.257
...and its occupants, if there are any.
- Occupants? Why, I never...

19:46.357 --> 19:48.336
What a story!
Where's the radio? Hey, Barnes!

19:48.436 --> 19:50.975
Hold it. No private messages.
- What do you mean private?

19:51.075 --> 19:54.014
I'm sending it to the whole world.
- This is Air Force information.

19:54.113 --> 19:56.054
We'll have to wait for authority
to let you file it.

19:56.154 --> 20:00.372
You got your authority in the Constitution!
It's called freedom of the press.

20:00.472 --> 20:02.412
I'm sending a story!
- Not from our ship.

20:02.512 --> 20:04.772
Where do you want the bombs?
- One by the stabilizer...

20:04.872 --> 20:07.250
...another over in the far side if we need it.

20:07.350 --> 20:10.728
It's the biggest story since the parting
of the Red Sea. You can't hide it!

20:10.828 --> 20:13.368
Think what it means to the world.
- I don't work for the world.

20:13.467 --> 20:15.087
Look...
- No, Scott. I'll take that.

20:15.187 --> 20:18.366
Here's the detonator.
- Get back to the ship and call the camp.

20:18.465 --> 20:23.603
Have Tex radio we've found a flying saucer
in the ice. We're gonna try to get it out.

20:23.704 --> 20:26.203
What about me?
- Also, ask if Scott can send his story.

20:26.302 --> 20:29.642
That's all I can do.
- You're gonna grow up to be another Fogarty.

20:29.742 --> 20:31.602
Where we gonna touch this off?
- Over there.

20:31.702 --> 20:34.121
Have you looked to the west?
That front's moving fast...

20:34.220 --> 20:38.880
...and the temperature's dropping too.
- We don't have more than an hour.

20:38.980 --> 20:41.357
Where do you put those, Bob?
- Right on the surface.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.476
Tell Stone. Will you, sir?
- Right.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.296
Say, what will this thermite do?

20:46.456 --> 20:49.436
This is S-O-P, standard operating
procedure for removing ice.

20:49.536 --> 20:52.234
Hook this wire up, will you, lieutenant?
It just melts it.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.154
How fast does it work?

20:54.254 --> 20:56.792
It'll uncover the whole saucer
in 30 seconds.

20:56.893 --> 20:58.793
All ready over here!
- Be right with you!

20:58.893 --> 21:06.115
Better clear the field! Over near the dog
sled! Gonna get pretty hot here in a minute.

21:18.005 --> 21:21.343
Hook her up. We'll try the stabilizer
first. Use the other one if we need it.

21:21.442 --> 21:24.424
A few minutes from now
we may have the key to the stars.

21:24.524 --> 21:27.541
A million years of history
are waiting for us in that ice.

21:27.642 --> 21:29.980
Say when. I wanna get a picture.
- All ready, sir.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.559
Ready here.
- Let her go, Bob.

21:40.598 --> 21:45.186
Okay, all clear.
- Wait a minute, everybody. Stay back.

21:46.035 --> 21:49.944
It's burning under the ice.
- Careful, captain.

21:51.994 --> 21:53.613
What's happening?

21:53.713 --> 21:55.712
Tell me, doctor.

21:56.632 --> 21:59.521
Get down on the ground, everybody!

22:16.423 --> 22:17.924
Everybody all right?

22:18.024 --> 22:20.244
That last explosion was the engine.

22:20.344 --> 22:22.762
Sergeant, will you try your Geiger counter?

22:22.862 --> 22:26.342
Only a trace.
- That's just residual.

22:27.021 --> 22:28.401
It's all gone.

22:28.500 --> 22:31.000
Secrets that might have
given us a new science.

22:31.098 --> 22:33.339
Gone.
- That's just dandy.

22:33.538 --> 22:35.318
Standard operating procedure.

22:35.418 --> 22:37.398
I should've thought...
- You sure should.

22:37.498 --> 22:39.758
Greatest discovery in history up in flames.

22:39.857 --> 22:44.191
Turning a new civilization
into a 4th of July piece.

22:46.095 --> 22:48.033
Captain, I'm getting something over here.

22:48.133 --> 22:53.827
Probably a fragment from the saucer.
- We may salvage something yet.

22:58.409 --> 23:00.390
Hold it, everybody.
I'm getting a reaction.

23:00.490 --> 23:02.489
Let me get a reading.

23:04.127 --> 23:06.126
Getting warm.

23:06.688 --> 23:08.687
Hotter now.

23:15.324 --> 23:17.874
Here's where it's coming from.

23:21.281 --> 23:23.061
What is it?
- Looks like a man.

23:23.161 --> 23:25.501
It's got legs and a head.
I can see them.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.019
Yeah! He must be over 8 feet long.

23:28.117 --> 23:30.218
Somebody got out of that saucer.
- Or was thrown out.

23:30.318 --> 23:33.177
And frozen fast before he could get clear.

23:33.278 --> 23:35.696
Man from Mars.
- How do you propose getting him out?

23:35.797 --> 23:37.377
I don't know.
- Use more thermite.

23:37.475 --> 23:39.736
Whatever's quickest.
We don't have much time.

23:39.836 --> 23:43.294
Here's axes. You could chop around
and put the block on the plane.

23:43.394 --> 23:44.493
I agree.
- Get started.

23:44.594 --> 23:47.813
Give me room.
- Bob, clear the sled and bring it over here.

23:47.912 --> 23:51.718
Eddie, get the ship warmed up.
And be ready to get out of here in a hurry.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.606
Pat, I think we made a mistake.
- What do you mean?

24:20.706 --> 24:24.115
You ever read this? 'Department
of Defense, Office of Public Information.

24:24.215 --> 24:27.205
Washington, D.C.
December 27, 1949.

24:27.364 --> 24:30.671
Bulletin 629-49 regarding item 6700...

24:30.871 --> 24:33.861
...extract 75,131.

24:34.020 --> 24:37.708
The Air Force has discontinued investigating
and evaluating reported flying saucers...

24:37.807 --> 24:40.100
...on the basis that there is no evidence.'

24:40.199 --> 24:43.328
Probably make you a general
for destroying evidence that they're wrong.

24:43.428 --> 24:46.436
'The Air Force said that all evidence
indicates that the reports...

24:46.536 --> 24:48.709
...of unidentified flying objects
are the result of:

24:48.808 --> 24:52.096
One: Misinterpretation of various
conventional objects.'

24:52.195 --> 24:54.011
Didn't look very conventional to me.

24:54.110 --> 24:56.201
'Second: A mild form of mass hysteria.'

24:56.301 --> 25:02.102
That'd be when General Fogarty got
to shaking hands with that thing in the ice.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.095
What are the other reasons?

25:04.004 --> 25:05.467
'Third: That they're jokes.'

25:05.567 --> 25:07.831
What did you say the number
of that bulletin was?

25:07.931 --> 25:13.861
'629-49, item 6700,
extract 75,131.'

25:14.343 --> 25:17.349
Oh. Oh, that one.

26:03.836 --> 26:06.702
Get on that rope, professor.
- I need a hand over here.

26:06.803 --> 26:08.887
Watch your feet.

26:09.927 --> 26:12.908
Let me tie another rope to go down.

26:13.696 --> 26:16.301
Hold it!
- Hold it back now.

26:17.543 --> 26:18.763
Hold it!

26:18.863 --> 26:20.867
Pull, back there!

26:24.233 --> 26:25.776
Keep tight on those ropes!

26:25.876 --> 26:27.180
Easy.
- Here we go.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.845
Keep it going.
- Keep it going!

26:30.405 --> 26:32.691
Whoa! Take it easy.

26:34.053 --> 26:37.059
Can't see through the ice too good.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.685
Good enough to know that where he came
from, they don't breed them for beauty.

26:40.785 --> 26:43.170
Well, what do we do now, defrost him?

26:43.270 --> 26:45.454
This ice will melt pretty soon.

26:45.554 --> 26:48.860
Can you control the heat in this room?
- No, captain. This is our storeroom.

26:48.961 --> 26:50.704
The temperature's constant here.

26:50.804 --> 26:53.228
We don't need to melt it.
We can chip it away.

26:53.328 --> 26:56.475
We're not going to melt it
or chip it. Eddie, open that window.

26:56.575 --> 26:59.200
We're not allowed to examine it?
- I mean just that.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.524
This is stupid.
- We're scientists.

27:01.624 --> 27:05.051
And Dr. Carrington's in charge here.
- Hey, Pat, these windows don't open.

27:05.151 --> 27:08.215
It's practically certain we'll be asked
by your superiors to study it.

27:08.316 --> 27:11.142
Probably, but we can't permit it now.
- We don't need permission...

27:11.243 --> 27:14.393
Eddie, break that window.
- All right.

27:16.212 --> 27:18.757
Sorry. We already pulled one boner
out in the ice.

27:18.857 --> 27:20.479
We may not know anything about this...

27:20.579 --> 27:24.208
...but until I receive instructions from my
superior officer, we'll have to mark time.

27:24.308 --> 27:27.172
You have no authority...
- If you want to talk, do it in the corridor.

27:27.273 --> 27:32.261
It's gonna get cold in here.
- At last a sensible suggestion, captain.

27:32.361 --> 27:34.025
Mac.
- Yeah?

27:34.126 --> 27:36.669
Please stay here.
And take four-hour shifts.

27:36.770 --> 27:38.794
It's hands off for everyone.
- Yes, sir.

27:38.895 --> 27:41.000
Gonna be warm enough?
- If not, you'll hear me squawk.

27:41.099 --> 27:43.843
Bob will bring you dinner.
- I could use something to read.

27:43.944 --> 27:49.394
A nice, quiet horror story.
- Might be kind of tame for you, sir.

27:52.559 --> 27:54.024
Well, gentlemen?
- Capt. Hendry...

27:54.124 --> 27:55.906
Excuse me, doctor. May I?
- Certainly.

27:56.006 --> 27:59.232
In relation to removing the body
from the ice, I'd like to point out...

27:59.333 --> 28:03.079
...there are organisms that survive
after death, but cold can destroy them.

28:03.180 --> 28:04.722
In view of that...
- I don't know...

28:04.822 --> 28:09.813
But these organisms may be dangerous. They
may be carrying germs from another planet.

28:09.913 --> 28:12.016
Germs we couldn't cope with medically.
- Thank you.

28:12.117 --> 28:14.381
I can't agree with you, Dr. Chapman.
- I don't either.

28:14.482 --> 28:17.466
Here's another: We don't know
what effect the air of our Earth...

28:17.566 --> 28:21.676
...may have on this creature's remains.
- Sort of go up in smoke, like the saucer?

28:21.776 --> 28:23.478
Nonsense.
- Isn't that far-fetched?

28:23.578 --> 28:26.242
So is a man from Mars.
- We're getting nowhere.

28:26.343 --> 28:30.171
I suggest that Capt. Hendry communicate
with his superior at once.

28:30.272 --> 28:34.018
I'm getting senile.
We should have done that first thing.

28:34.118 --> 28:38.026
I'm surprised, captain, that you didn't try
to reach your general on our way back here.

28:38.126 --> 28:39.389
We did. Barnes.

28:39.488 --> 28:43.236
I tried through your radio operator.
Couldn't get through. Too much interference.

28:43.337 --> 28:46.998
I see. My apologies, captain.
- Yes, doctor.

28:48.346 --> 28:49.608
Hi, captain.
- Hi, Tex.

28:49.708 --> 28:51.530
You sure stirred up a lot of trouble...

28:51.630 --> 28:53.736
Did you send out my message?
- Sure did.

28:53.836 --> 28:56.500
Get an answer back?
- This came an hour ago. Can you read it?

28:56.601 --> 28:58.704
No, you'd better.
- 'Fogarty to Hendry:

28:58.804 --> 29:01.911
Withhold newspaper story
until permission from Air Force HQ.'

29:02.012 --> 29:05.036
There you are, Scotty.
- Fine. Now somebody else will get the story.

29:05.136 --> 29:09.965
'Remove aircraft from ice at once. Use
thermite bombs if necessary to melt ice.'

29:10.065 --> 29:14.054
Oh, that's what I like about the Army.
Smart all the way to the top.

29:14.155 --> 29:17.460
That lets you off the hook for the thermite...
- Take it easy. Go ahead.

29:17.560 --> 29:21.588
'Erect temporary structure to protect aircraft
until my arrival.'

29:21.688 --> 29:24.794
Here's another one. Came a few minutes ago.
Could only get part of it.

29:24.895 --> 29:28.119
Go ahead.
- 'Everything grounded. Can't...' Something.

29:28.219 --> 29:31.047
'Want you...' Something or other...
- That sounds like Fogarty.

29:31.147 --> 29:33.290
Then it got fouled up.
- You're getting nothing?

29:33.390 --> 29:36.296
Nothing. Static's knocking
it right out of the air.

29:36.397 --> 29:39.421
What about your stuff?
- Don't know if they're getting it. I doubt it.

29:39.521 --> 29:41.585
I don't believe it.
Even the Pony Express got through.

29:41.685 --> 29:43.831
Well, doctor?
- In view of this new situation...

29:43.930 --> 29:46.153
Doesn't alter the old one.
- We disagree with you.

29:46.254 --> 29:48.960
There's no reason to delay...
- Sorry, gentlemen. That's it.

29:49.060 --> 29:51.363
Tex, I'd like to leave Barnes
to help out all he can.

29:51.463 --> 29:53.448
Sure.
- Barnes, keep trying to get through.

29:53.548 --> 29:55.170
I wanna get a message to the general.

29:55.270 --> 29:58.698
Tell him the aircraft was completely
destroyed by the thermite bomb.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.422
Tell him we found a passenger...
- A fellow from Mars? Where?

30:01.522 --> 30:02.705
On ice, buddy.

30:02.805 --> 30:05.550
Tell him the body's in ice
and Dr. Carrington wants permission...

30:05.650 --> 30:07.954
...to remove the body
from the ice for examination.

30:08.054 --> 30:10.680
We're standing by for instructions
before further action.

30:10.780 --> 30:11.883
Yes, sir.

30:11.983 --> 30:15.049
You got anything to add, doctor?
- Yes, one very essential point.

30:15.149 --> 30:17.893
That it's vitally important
that the examination be made.

30:17.922 --> 30:19.990
By all means. Yeah.
- Add that, Barnes.

30:20.092 --> 30:22.802
Thank you, captain.
That's all that concerns me.

30:22.903 --> 30:25.333
When you get your answer,
I expect you to let me know.

30:25.434 --> 30:27.443
Yes, doctor.

30:30.855 --> 30:33.324
Wait till I interview the doctor
about what he thinks of you.

30:33.201 --> 30:35.504
Probably be good.
- If it isn't, I'll make it good.

30:35.604 --> 30:39.706
Tex, keep trying. Barnes, if he gets through,
ask again about clearing Mr. Scott.

30:39.806 --> 30:42.388
Don't try to soft-soap me.
I don't like you any better.

30:42.489 --> 30:45.711
I'll eat with you, Eddie.
- I'll send you some chow.

30:45.811 --> 30:48.993
Captain, I'm gonna check the ship
and tie her down. We'll need our gear.

30:49.093 --> 30:51.394
This storm may blow for weeks.
- Get the Eskimos to help.

30:51.494 --> 30:53.277
They took off when they saw that ice.

30:53.377 --> 30:55.517
They'll need a lot of coaxing
to get them back.

30:55.617 --> 30:57.879
If Mr. Scott and the lieutenant
would give me a hand...

30:57.979 --> 30:59.640
I'm a guest.
- I'm an officer.

30:59.740 --> 31:01.722
You can order me around
while carrying the other end.

31:01.822 --> 31:04.185
That'll help a lot, sarge.

31:06.065 --> 31:08.807
You know, Pat? I thought
we were gonna have a little trouble.

31:08.907 --> 31:11.810
So did I.
- The geniuses were ready to tear you apart.

31:11.910 --> 31:14.451
They're like kids drooling over
a new fire engine.

31:14.551 --> 31:18.174
Professor Vorhees, come
to the laboratory as soon as possible.

31:18.274 --> 31:21.896
Holding a meeting. Whole thing's weird.
- You know what it reminds me of?

31:21.996 --> 31:25.539
The time I was stuck on Beulen Island
with the old 97th bomber group.

31:25.639 --> 31:28.702
An Army nurse came ashore
and caused the same disturbance...

31:28.802 --> 31:31.863
...as this guy from Mars has here.
- What happened to the nurse?

31:31.964 --> 31:33.966
She liked it there.

31:35.366 --> 31:39.470
Scotty, what's new?
- What's new? What more do you want?

31:39.570 --> 31:43.632
Biggest story ever to hit this planet,
and I run into this human clam.

31:43.732 --> 31:45.873
Why are you getting pretty?
You'll never look good to me.

31:45.973 --> 31:47.794
That's not for you...
- Take it easy.

31:47.894 --> 31:51.719
The captain here passes the buck to
General Fogarty, he takes it to Washington.

31:51.819 --> 31:53.799
Who will Truman ask?
- Margaret.

31:53.899 --> 31:57.242
I've got to find a way to get to civilization.
- How, for instance?

31:57.343 --> 32:01.085
I don't know. Pogo sticks. Kiddie cars.
Gondolas. Dogsleds.

32:01.185 --> 32:05.526
Hey, Barnes, any word come from Fogarty?
- Plenty. Nothing about you, sir.

32:05.626 --> 32:09.331
I think the old man's gone crazy.
Sorry, sir. Shouldn't have said that.

32:09.431 --> 32:13.413
If he hollers louder, we won't need a radio.
- What was the gist of the conversation?

32:13.513 --> 32:18.618
There's been a leak, and the newspapers...
- I knew it! Like water through a sieve.

32:18.718 --> 32:21.380
Everyone wants information,
Congress, Secretary of State...

32:21.480 --> 32:24.021
...and especially General Fogarty.
He's having a fit.

32:24.121 --> 32:26.143
Isn't Anchorage picking us up?
- No, sir.

32:26.243 --> 32:28.944
We're picking up them
because they have a stronger station.

32:29.044 --> 32:32.868
A picture just came to me:
My editor climbing all over his office...

32:32.968 --> 32:37.069
...yelling, stamping his feet.
He'll probably shoot himself by midnight.

32:37.169 --> 32:40.392
Take it easy, Scotty.
- Just a minute. I'm not sure you're ready.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.813
You may have missed a spot.

32:42.974 --> 32:45.397
Son, would you like
double guard duty tonight?

32:45.497 --> 32:47.498
No, sir. I wouldn't.

32:47.617 --> 32:48.998
Oh, captain.
- Yes, sergeant?

32:49.098 --> 32:52.781
Could I see you for a minute, sir?
- Sure.

32:58.985 --> 33:00.006
What is it, Bob?

33:00.106 --> 33:04.890
It's about Lt. McPherson sitting in there
with that thing in the block of ice.

33:04.990 --> 33:06.532
Getting nervous?

33:06.632 --> 33:10.213
Well, he wouldn't want me to tell you, sir,
but he's having kittens.

33:10.313 --> 33:12.614
I haven't heard him squawk like this
since Rechenberg.

33:12.714 --> 33:13.735
Really?

33:13.835 --> 33:17.659
You see, sir, the ice is clearing up,
and we can see that thing pretty good.

33:17.759 --> 33:21.842
It's got crazy hands and no hair,
and the eyes...

33:21.882 --> 33:25.584
They're open and look like they can see.
- Bob, I haven't heard you...

33:25.684 --> 33:28.506
It's got me too, sir,
and I wasn't in there very long.

33:28.606 --> 33:33.509
Besides that, it's pretty cold.
I got the lieutenant an electric blanket.

33:33.609 --> 33:36.152
Captain, I got a suggestion.
- Go ahead.

33:36.253 --> 33:39.113
Instead of four-hour shifts,
we could cut them in half...

33:39.213 --> 33:42.976
Okay. You tell Barnes to take over at 2200.

33:43.137 --> 33:46.160
You take over at 2400,
and I'll relieve you at 0200.

33:46.260 --> 33:49.441
I think you're right, sir.
- I think you are.

33:49.541 --> 33:51.542
Thank you, sir.

34:03.192 --> 34:05.953
I want to talk to you.
- Sure.

34:06.112 --> 34:08.554
Pat, what's really going on?

34:08.714 --> 34:12.097
Nothing. I just can't agree with your pals.
I had to set a guard.

34:12.197 --> 34:14.818
They'd have that thing
up waltzing with them.

34:14.918 --> 34:16.380
No, that isn't what I meant.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.621
What does that boogeyman
in ice really mean?

34:18.721 --> 34:20.722
I don't know, Nikki.

34:21.284 --> 34:25.666
Well, does it mean that we'll have visitors
from other planets dropping in on us?

34:25.766 --> 34:28.308
Do we have to return the call, or...?
Oh, jeepers.

34:28.408 --> 34:32.110
I know. Yesterday I'd said it was crazy.
- I'd say it's crazy now.

34:32.210 --> 34:35.313
Forget it. Tomorrow it'll all seem different.

34:35.413 --> 34:39.516
I suppose so. I like the way
you handled this whole mess, Pat.

34:39.616 --> 34:43.000
I'd just as soon not.
You know, it's funny. I'm glad I was here.

34:43.100 --> 34:44.721
I am too.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.600
You're much nicer when you're...

34:46.699 --> 34:48.362
When you're not mad.

34:48.463 --> 34:52.445
Sounds promising. How about that
business of beginning over again?

34:52.545 --> 34:58.500
Well, I think I'll buy you a drink this time.
I think you've earned it.

34:58.830 --> 35:02.373
That is, if you want one.
- You can tie my hands if you wanna.

35:02.473 --> 35:05.256
That might not be such a bad idea.
- You mean that?

35:05.356 --> 35:09.949
Well, you suggested it.
- All right. I'll bring a rope.

35:18.884 --> 35:22.507
You want another one, Pat?
- Don't you think you could untie me now?

35:22.607 --> 35:24.708
I don't know. What's the matter?

35:24.808 --> 35:29.111
You gals. If a guy asks you to dinner and
buys you a drink and tries to kiss you...

35:29.212 --> 35:31.433
Why are you laughing?
- You never kissed me.

35:31.533 --> 35:33.275
I haven't tried.
- How do you know?

35:33.375 --> 35:37.078
Oh, stop bringing that up.
- Never mind. You haven't. Maybe if you'd...

35:37.178 --> 35:39.119
Go on with what you were saying.
- What?

35:39.219 --> 35:40.920
About the dinner and the drink.

35:41.020 --> 35:43.843
Well, if the same man asked you
to have 30,000 dinners...

35:43.943 --> 35:46.764
Then he's not a wolf anymore?
That's fine philosophy.

35:46.864 --> 35:51.406
So you really want your hands untied.
Just when everything was nice and peaceful.

35:51.506 --> 35:56.610
You know, I'm glad we decided
to start over again. I like it.

35:57.352 --> 36:00.133
I like that too.
- Talk about Japanese tortures.

36:00.233 --> 36:03.256
No, not at all. I think this was a great idea.

36:03.356 --> 36:05.357
Come here.

36:06.477 --> 36:08.178
Well, look at you...

36:08.278 --> 36:12.503
...sitting there like a civilized man instead
of grabbing around like a throwback.

36:12.603 --> 36:16.305
If you weren't tied up, I wouldn't dare
have told you how much I liked you.

36:16.405 --> 36:21.387
You know, Pat, the trouble with you is that
you don't know anything about women.

36:21.488 --> 36:23.149
What a woman wants is to...

36:23.249 --> 36:25.250
Is to...

36:25.933 --> 36:28.794
How long have you been loose?
- Long enough.

36:28.894 --> 36:32.195
It's been a very interesting evening.
Good night, Miss Nicholson.

36:32.295 --> 36:39.100
Pat, if you walk out on me like this...
- I wouldn't go, except I gotta check up.

36:43.504 --> 36:45.786
Get a good night's sleep.

36:45.947 --> 36:48.329
I'll see you in the morning.

36:49.108 --> 36:52.051
It's the eyes being open that gets you.
Makes you feel so...

36:52.151 --> 36:56.172
Hi, Pat. Barnes just got here. Sure glad
I'm not looking at that guy anymore.

36:56.272 --> 36:57.655
All set, Barnes?
- Yes, sir.

36:57.755 --> 37:01.777
Got an electric flying suit and coffee.
- Bob will relieve you at 2400.

37:01.877 --> 37:04.838
Take it easy.
- Yeah.

37:44.547 --> 37:46.549
That's better.

38:40.708 --> 38:43.769
Capt. Hendry! Capt. Hendry!
Capt. Hendry.

38:43.869 --> 38:45.692
What's the matter, corporal?

38:45.792 --> 38:49.533
Where's the captain? I've got to tell him
that thing's alive. I saw it.

38:49.633 --> 38:52.255
It chased me. It's not dead. It's...

38:52.355 --> 38:54.357
Capt. Hendry!

38:54.437 --> 38:57.940
That thing's alive, sir.
I saw it. I shot at it. I hit it, I know it.

38:58.040 --> 39:02.101
Nothing happened. It kept coming at me,
making a noise like a cat meowing.

39:02.201 --> 39:08.921
If you could have seen those hands and
those eyes! You've got to do something...

39:10.407 --> 39:13.069
Mac, Bob, get some guns.
Now, Barnes, what happened?

39:13.169 --> 39:17.832
I'm sorry, sir. I don't know exactly, but all of
a sudden it was alive and coming at me.

39:17.932 --> 39:21.315
I shot at it and hit it.
Nothing happened, so I ran...

39:21.415 --> 39:22.796
Easy, easy.
- I'm sorry, sir.

39:22.896 --> 39:26.554
Here, captain.
- Take care of him. Will you?

39:28.380 --> 39:30.381
Get back to sleep.

39:34.506 --> 39:37.143
Get back with the rest of them.

39:51.958 --> 39:55.300
What could've...?
- Kid said he was alive. I believe him.

39:55.400 --> 39:58.061
I knew it. All the time I was here,
I could feel it.

39:58.926 --> 40:03.697
Here's what did it.
This blanket was on. It's still warm.

40:08.067 --> 40:11.174
He got out of here, all right.
- Get parkas, boots and a flashlight!

40:11.274 --> 40:14.983
Listen. They'll tear him to pieces.
- We must save him.

40:15.084 --> 40:19.112
Hold it, doctor. You'll freeze to death
in five minutes. Use your head!

40:19.212 --> 40:24.919
I expect you're right. I was overanxious.
- Look over here, captain!

40:29.194 --> 40:32.101
I think I've got yours.
- May I have one, captain?

40:32.202 --> 40:34.331
Better let us go, doctor.

40:36.411 --> 40:40.415
Doc, can you see anything out there?
- Not much.

40:42.062 --> 40:44.587
You all set?
- Let her go.

41:45.844 --> 41:50.113
Captain, it would help if you, any of you,
would describe what you saw out there.

41:50.213 --> 41:53.159
It was too cold to see well,
but the dogs had him down.

41:53.260 --> 41:56.647
He got up with three hanging on his arm.
- He threw one at the rest.

41:56.747 --> 41:59.372
Two were dead.
- Looked like they'd been through a chopper.

41:59.472 --> 42:02.340
Where did you find the arm?
- Partly under one of them.

42:02.440 --> 42:05.285
Could dogs tear off an arm?

42:05.446 --> 42:08.011
This kind of an arm.

42:08.173 --> 42:12.523
Be careful, doctor. Those barbs are sharp.
- Seems to be a sort of chitinous substance.

42:12.623 --> 42:13.684
Speak English.

42:13.784 --> 42:16.651
Something between a beetle's back
and a rose thorn.

42:16.752 --> 42:18.455
Thorn-fingered?
- Amazingly strong.

42:18.556 --> 42:20.380
Very effective as a weapon.
- Very.

42:20.480 --> 42:24.750
We don't have to worry about that. An arm
off and out in that cold, he's dead now.

42:24.850 --> 42:27.235
Got along fine in a block of ice for 24 hours.

42:27.335 --> 42:30.641
Pretty spry for a guy with 12 dogs on him.
- And for losing an arm.

42:30.742 --> 42:33.729
I'm losing my mind.
- Amazing, isn't it?

42:33.829 --> 42:36.836
Amazingly strong.
- Strange.

42:37.077 --> 42:40.305
I'm sure of it.
- That is blood on the hand. Isn't it?

42:40.405 --> 42:42.910
Yes, but not his.
- Probably from one of the dogs.

42:43.011 --> 42:46.844
There's no blood in the arm,
no animal tissue.

42:46.858 --> 42:52.055
Dr. Stern, would you have a look at this
under the microscope?

42:53.552 --> 42:58.303
No, Mr. Scott. I doubt very much if it
can die, as we understand dying.

42:58.404 --> 43:01.571
Holy cat!
- Yes.

43:01.772 --> 43:03.274
Well, doctor?

43:03.375 --> 43:09.428
No arterial structure indicated.
No nerve endings visible.

43:10.751 --> 43:13.458
Porous, unconnected cellular growth.

43:13.558 --> 43:18.828
Just a minute, doctor. Sounds like
you're trying to describe a vegetable.

43:18.928 --> 43:22.357
I am. Are you getting all of this?
- Oh, for Pete's sake!

43:22.457 --> 43:27.408
You know, doctor, that could be why
Sgt. Barnes' bullets had no effect.

43:27.508 --> 43:30.414
That's right.
- Merely holes drilled into vegetable matter.

43:30.515 --> 43:32.519
This green fluid here.

43:32.560 --> 43:35.344
Like plant sap.
- We'll probably find it has a sugar base.

43:35.445 --> 43:37.790
Please, doctor, I've got to ask this.

43:37.890 --> 43:43.924
It sounds like, well... Just as though
you're describing some form of super carrot.

43:44.024 --> 43:45.889
That's nearly right, Mr. Scott.

43:45.989 --> 43:51.943
This carrot, as you call it, has constructed an
aircraft capable of flying millions of miles...

43:52.043 --> 43:54.908
...propelled by a force
as yet unknown to us.

43:55.008 --> 43:58.836
An intellectual carrot. The mind boggles.
- It shouldn't.

43:58.936 --> 44:02.205
Imagine how strange it would have seemed
during the Pliocene age...

44:02.305 --> 44:08.377
...to forecast that worms, fish, lizards that
crawled over the Earth would evolve into us.

44:08.478 --> 44:10.623
On the planet from which our visitor came...

44:10.723 --> 44:14.793
...vegetable life underwent an evolution
similar to that of our own animal life...

44:14.894 --> 44:18.041
...which would account
for the superiority of its brain.

44:18.141 --> 44:22.889
Its development was not handicapped
by emotional or sexual factors.

44:22.990 --> 44:25.858
Dr. Carrington, you won the Nobel Prize.

44:25.958 --> 44:29.385
You've received every kind of kudos
a scientist can attain.

44:29.485 --> 44:33.113
If you were for sale, I could get a million
bucks for you from any foreign government.

44:33.213 --> 44:37.241
I'm not, therefore, gonna stick my neck out
and say you're stuffed full...

44:37.341 --> 44:41.731
...of wild blueberry muffins. But I promise
you, my readers are gonna think so.

44:41.831 --> 44:46.863
Not for long, Mr. Scott. Not if they know
anything about the flora of their own planet.

44:46.964 --> 44:50.592
You mean there are vegetables
right here on Earth that can think?

44:50.692 --> 44:55.083
A certain kind of thinking, yes.
You ever hear of the telegraph vine?

44:55.183 --> 44:57.227
Not recently.
- Or the...

44:57.666 --> 45:00.374
Is it the acanthus century plant, Dr. Stern?
- Yes.

45:00.474 --> 45:02.378
Go ahead, doctor. That's your field.

45:02.478 --> 45:07.870
Well, the century plant catches mice,
bats, squirrels, any small mammals.

45:07.970 --> 45:12.120
Uses a sweet syrup as bait,
then holds onto its catch and feeds on it.

45:12.220 --> 45:14.435
What's the telegraph vine?

45:14.546 --> 45:18.493
The vine, research has proven, can signal
to other vines of the same species...

45:18.593 --> 45:21.400
...vines 20 to 100 miles away.

45:21.561 --> 45:24.948
Intelligence in plants and vegetables
is an old story, Mr. Scott.

45:25.048 --> 45:28.156
Older even than the animal arrogance
that has overlooked it.

45:28.256 --> 45:29.919
That's one for Ripley.
- Look here.

45:30.020 --> 45:34.730
I took this from under the soft tissue
in the palm of the hand.

45:34.830 --> 45:36.734
A seedpod.
- Seedpod?

45:36.834 --> 45:42.227
Yes. The neat and unconfused
reproductive technique of vegetation.

45:42.327 --> 45:45.373
No pain or pleasure as we know it.

45:45.532 --> 45:47.536
No emotions...

45:47.696 --> 45:49.037
...no heart.

45:49.137 --> 45:53.623
Our superior. Our superior in every way.

45:53.943 --> 45:56.164
Gentlemen, do you realize
what we've found?

45:56.265 --> 46:01.252
A being from another world as different
from us as one pole from the other.

46:01.352 --> 46:04.015
If we can only communicate with it...

46:04.115 --> 46:10.924
...we can learn secrets that have been
hidden from mankind since the beginning...

46:19.254 --> 46:22.498
Holy cat. It's moving.

46:22.658 --> 46:24.921
Miss Nicholson.
- Yes, doctor?

46:25.021 --> 46:28.866
At 12:10 A.M., the hand became alive.

46:30.748 --> 46:35.515
The temperature of the forearm
showed a 20-degree rise.

46:35.674 --> 46:39.017
Because of this rise in temperature,
I believe it was able to ingest...

46:39.117 --> 46:41.823
...the canine blood with which
it was covered. I believe...

46:41.923 --> 46:46.366
You mean...
You mean it lives on blood.

46:47.848 --> 46:50.271
This is the best we could find.
- This should work.

46:50.371 --> 46:53.357
Where are you going?
- To find our visitor, if we can.

46:53.457 --> 46:55.460
One moment, captain!

46:56.501 --> 46:59.042
Check the storeroom again.
Bolt any outside doors.

46:59.142 --> 47:01.486
Captain, when you find
what you're looking for...

47:01.586 --> 47:03.690
...remember it's a stranger
in a strange land.

47:03.790 --> 47:06.252
The only crimes were those
committed against it.

47:06.352 --> 47:10.617
It woke from a block of ice, was attacked
by dogs and shot by a frightened man.

47:10.717 --> 47:16.590
All I want is to communicate with it.
- Fine, provided it's locked up.

47:16.604 --> 47:20.589
If we catch him, let me take his picture
before somebody makes a salad of him.

47:20.689 --> 47:22.973
Sure, Scotty.

47:25.696 --> 47:28.921
Bob, get up on there.
- What's up? Looks like a lynching party.

47:29.021 --> 47:31.081
Have any visitors?
- Not a soul.

47:31.182 --> 47:35.689
I got part of a message from the general.
He said to wait on Mr. Scott's story.

47:35.789 --> 47:38.330
What's the difference?
Nothing's going out anyway.

47:38.431 --> 47:40.935
What are you looking for?
- Couldn't come in here.

47:41.035 --> 47:42.456
Who?
- The man from Mars.

47:42.557 --> 47:44.180
You mean he's alive and loose?

47:44.280 --> 47:47.583
Keep your door locked. Use your axe
if you have to. Gun's no good.

47:47.683 --> 47:51.683
What do you mean the gun's no good?
Now, look...

47:53.369 --> 47:55.371
Eddie.

47:57.015 --> 47:59.018
Hold it, captain.

48:20.202 --> 48:23.468
There's something in here, all right.
- You're a little off base.

48:23.367 --> 48:26.514
That's the mineralogy lab.
Radioactive isotopes are in there.

48:26.614 --> 48:30.244
Your Geiger's reacting to a roomful
of uranium ore samples.

48:30.344 --> 48:32.349
Yeah.

48:43.616 --> 48:45.843
This door's locked.
- Dr. Stern has the key.

48:45.943 --> 48:47.848
Oh, yes.
- What's in here?

48:47.948 --> 48:51.337
The greenhouse. The Eskimos have
a weakness for our strawberries.

48:51.437 --> 48:55.101
Strawberries at the North Pole.
- Excuse me.

48:59.778 --> 49:01.783
Mac. Bob.

49:02.024 --> 49:04.069
Look under these tables.

49:09.921 --> 49:12.490
Bob, check that outside door.

49:16.860 --> 49:18.685
Door's locked, sir.
- Nothing up here.

49:18.786 --> 49:21.110
We're still batting zero.

49:22.835 --> 49:24.659
Well, doctor?
- Captain, I...

49:24.759 --> 49:27.626
Nothing up that other corridor.
- Any suggestions, doctor?

49:27.726 --> 49:30.475
He's obviously not inside.
- We'll start looking outside...

49:30.575 --> 49:32.479
Close the door, please.
- Never mind.

49:32.579 --> 49:36.971
Captain, half an hour outside now is all
we can stand. We'd better do it in relay.

49:37.071 --> 49:41.542
You're right, Dr. Chapman. We'll work out...
- Would you close the door, please?

49:41.643 --> 49:43.787
We have to tell General Fogarty
what happened.

49:43.887 --> 49:45.512
We're liable to become famous.

49:45.613 --> 49:51.366
So few people can boast they've lost a flying
saucer and a man from Mars all in one day.

49:51.466 --> 49:55.497
Wonder what they'd have done to Columbus
if he'd discovered America, then mislaid it.

49:55.598 --> 49:57.421
Bunch of butterfingers.

49:57.521 --> 50:00.309
Gentlemen, I just happened to notice...

50:00.410 --> 50:02.896
Look at these moles.

50:07.868 --> 50:10.094
They're wilted.
The only thing that could...

50:10.194 --> 50:12.939
A blast of icy air
if that rear door was opened.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.462
Have a look at that lock, professor.
- Yes.

50:15.562 --> 50:20.169
10 or 15 seconds of exposure would do it.
- Exactly.

50:20.369 --> 50:22.851
What would that lead you to?

50:23.171 --> 50:25.574
That it may have been...

50:25.773 --> 50:29.258
In here.
- Without a doubt.

50:29.419 --> 50:33.201
Dr. Carrington, you were right.
The lock's been forced back into position.

50:33.301 --> 50:37.768
The key's gone. Someone has entered
and gone and locked the door from...

50:37.868 --> 50:40.770
From the outside.
- Look. See how it glistens in the light?

50:40.870 --> 50:43.072
It's a smear of...

50:43.234 --> 50:47.257
Plant sap. From the wounded arm?
- You don't suppose...?

50:47.357 --> 50:49.399
Open it, please.

50:59.211 --> 51:03.215
One of the sled dogs.
- Not even cold yet.

51:04.535 --> 51:09.240
Doctor, doesn't it seem kind of...?
- Shrunken. Is there any blood in there?

51:09.340 --> 51:11.082
None.
- No blood.

51:11.182 --> 51:13.284
No blood?
- Its blood has been drained.

51:13.384 --> 51:15.848
Everything falls right into line.

51:15.948 --> 51:21.053
What could be more natural for such a being
than seeking out the only open earth nearby?

51:21.153 --> 51:25.439
It came here for refuge, heard us and ran.

51:25.637 --> 51:28.661
It's been here. It will come back again.
- We better tell...

51:28.761 --> 51:32.146
I don't agree. It's far better
if science rather than the Army...

51:32.246 --> 51:36.831
Are you sure this is the best thing to do?
- I'm sure we can communicate with it.

51:36.931 --> 51:41.755
It's wiser than we are. It's our only chance
to talk to it, to learn so many things.

51:41.855 --> 51:44.959
Dr. Carrington is right.
- Surely you understand that, Stern.

51:45.059 --> 51:48.000
Will you two stand guard
here with me tonight?

51:48.101 --> 51:49.562
Surely, doctor.
- All right.

51:49.662 --> 51:52.888
Stern, tell Dr. Auerbach and Dr. Olson
what we've found.

51:52.988 --> 51:56.691
Ask them to come back
and relieve us in the morning.

51:56.791 --> 52:00.594
And tell them, please,
to confide in no one.

52:15.450 --> 52:18.995
Any luck, captain?
- Lee, you better get some more coffee ready.

52:19.095 --> 52:22.038
Find anything, captain?
- Not a sign.

52:22.138 --> 52:24.760
Barnes flushed a polar bear.
- Sure did.

52:24.861 --> 52:28.004
Scare you?
- Not after I saw it was only a bear.

52:28.104 --> 52:30.566
Too cold out there for that.
- You didn't find anything.

52:30.666 --> 52:33.609
I didn't think you would.
When we lose them, they stay lost.

52:33.709 --> 52:37.734
Not that it makes much difference.
Nothing's coming in on the radio.

52:37.834 --> 52:41.537
Tex, you got something?
- General Fogarty's running a temperature.

52:41.637 --> 52:44.422
This came in clear 10 minutes ago,
then it got fouled up again.

52:44.522 --> 52:49.145
'Fogarty to Hendry: Take all precautions to
preserve aircraft carefully until my arrival.'

52:49.245 --> 52:53.192
Same to same.'Use same precautions
with corpses of any occupants.'

52:53.292 --> 52:56.874
Same to same.
'Forward detailed description of aircraft.

52:56.975 --> 53:00.158
Measurements, approximate weight
and so forth. Important.'

53:00.258 --> 53:03.763
'Fogarty to Hendry: Why haven't
you answered? Want immediate answer.'

53:03.863 --> 53:08.126
Same to same.'Radio silence unnecessary.
Reference message Fogarty to Hendry.

53:08.226 --> 53:10.088
Acknowledge immediately.

53:10.189 --> 53:12.131
Waiting report. Silence confusing.'

53:12.231 --> 53:14.054
Same to same.'Acknowledge. '

53:14.154 --> 53:16.016
Same to same...
- Acknowledge at once.

53:16.116 --> 53:20.501
I gather he wants to hear from me.
- There's nothing for me? I don't believe it.

53:20.601 --> 53:24.345
How can a man get to be
a general without...?

53:26.445 --> 53:27.987
In the greenhouse...

53:28.088 --> 53:30.090
See...

53:30.371 --> 53:33.233
Barnes, watch that corridor.
- Bring the first aid kit.

53:33.333 --> 53:37.238
Captain, this is my job.
- Bob, better start warning the rest of camp.

53:37.338 --> 53:41.523
Does that speaker system work from here?
- Yes. The left switch runs to all rooms.

53:41.623 --> 53:44.246
Attention, everybody in camp.
Bolt your doors.

53:44.346 --> 53:48.448
Our visitor has returned and is dangerous.
Stay where you are until notified.

53:48.548 --> 53:50.550
Stay where you are.

53:56.359 --> 53:59.621
Easy. It'll be all right.
- What happened, doctor?

53:59.721 --> 54:02.344
In the greenhouse,
I was working. I couldn't see.

54:02.444 --> 54:05.829
Then a blast of cold air,
and I heard Olson scream.

54:05.929 --> 54:09.272
When I turned, the thing struck at me.
- Go on.

54:09.372 --> 54:13.372
I don't remember. My head...
I must have fallen.

54:13.496 --> 54:16.478
When I came to, I saw Olson and Auerbach.
They were...

54:16.578 --> 54:21.683
Give him some more of that. Get those axes.
Go ahead, doctor.

54:21.743 --> 54:26.089
They were both hanging from the beams
upside down, dead. Their throats were cut.

54:26.189 --> 54:27.851
I crawled...
- Was it there when you left?

54:27.951 --> 54:29.953
I couldn't see.

54:30.234 --> 54:34.914
Here you are, sir.
- Wait, Pat! I want to get a picture.

54:41.524 --> 54:45.350
Wait a minute. He could get out
of the greenhouse through the outside door.

54:45.451 --> 54:49.074
We can get to it through the generator room.
- You two go with him.

54:49.175 --> 54:52.398
You mean go in?
- Seal the door with anything you can find.

54:52.498 --> 54:54.500
That's better.

54:54.539 --> 54:58.845
Easy. Give them time to get in there.
- Pat, I want a picture.

54:58.945 --> 55:02.047
You get back with the rest.
- Don't be silly.

55:02.147 --> 55:05.976
It'll cost you a drink.
- I'll buy him a beer.

55:08.714 --> 55:12.288
Ready, Bob?
- No, but go ahead and open it.

55:24.410 --> 55:30.036
Get something to prop this door, something
short enough to get under this bolt!

55:30.136 --> 55:33.961
Get your picture, Scotty?
- No. The door wasn't open long enough.

55:34.061 --> 55:36.242
Want me to open it again?
- No!

55:36.343 --> 55:41.023
Bring a hammer and some spikes!
- Hit that in, will you?

55:41.909 --> 55:43.810
There. That ought to do it.

55:43.911 --> 55:47.697
Doctor Chapman, you're sure
there's no other way out? No windows?

55:47.797 --> 55:49.817
Only the front and back doors.
- The walls solid?

55:49.917 --> 55:53.491
Corrugated iron.
- You don't think that...?

55:56.404 --> 56:00.548
You found a dog in there, bled white
by our visitor. Why didn't you report it?

56:00.648 --> 56:03.914
It wasn't necessary.
- It was necessary to leave friends to die?

56:04.014 --> 56:05.635
I posted them as guards...

56:05.735 --> 56:10.400
I looked in. They're hanging upside down
like in a slaughterhouse. Wish you'd seen it.

56:10.500 --> 56:12.443
Can't we do something?
- They're dead.

56:12.543 --> 56:17.087
Let's see nobody joins them. Doctor, you're
limited to your room, lab and the mess hall.

56:17.187 --> 56:20.652
You have no authority of any kind.
No right to assume...

56:20.752 --> 56:22.834
You better move along.

56:28.117 --> 56:30.501
We've got the rear door blocked.
If he gets out...

56:30.601 --> 56:33.705
...he'll have to dig through
oil drums and a couple tons of snow.

56:33.805 --> 56:38.671
Bob, next time raise the sights a little.
- I was too busy to think about that.

56:38.771 --> 56:41.633
We're gonna have to set up
a guard here in the corridor.

56:41.733 --> 56:47.008
Two-hour shifts. We'll need volunteers.
- Count me in, captain.

56:54.426 --> 56:56.549
You sent for us, doctor?

57:00.231 --> 57:03.597
You said you had news for us, doctor.

57:03.756 --> 57:07.360
Yes, yes. I...

57:09.962 --> 57:12.306
Gentlemen, we find ourselves in a battle.

57:12.406 --> 57:16.229
I'm not referring to the minor argument
with Capt. Hendry...

57:16.330 --> 57:19.563
...but this creature from a new world.

57:19.732 --> 57:23.117
Two of our colleagues have died,
a third is injured.

57:23.217 --> 57:25.761
Those are our losses,
and there may be more.

57:25.861 --> 57:28.883
This creature is more powerful
and intelligent than we are.

57:28.983 --> 57:32.047
He regards us as important
only for his nourishment.

57:32.147 --> 57:38.274
He has the same attitude toward us
as we have toward a field of cabbages.

57:38.433 --> 57:40.917
That is our battle.

57:41.077 --> 57:47.288
Only science can conquer him.
All other weapons will be powerless, only...

57:47.644 --> 57:49.424
There must...

57:49.524 --> 57:54.330
There must be a way. I've been trying to...

57:57.333 --> 57:59.715
Sorry. I'm very tired. I haven't slept.

57:59.815 --> 58:01.817
It's difficult...

58:02.257 --> 58:04.541
Difficult to talk.

58:05.181 --> 58:09.045
Will you read my notes, Miss Nicholson?
- Doctor, you need some rest.

58:09.146 --> 58:11.388
Yes, I know, but...

58:12.789 --> 58:14.792
Please read my notes.

58:14.873 --> 58:18.617
'At 9:00 P.M., I placed the seeds taken from
the severed hand of X...

58:18.717 --> 58:20.417
...in four inches of earth.

58:20.517 --> 58:23.080
I saturated the earth...

58:24.241 --> 58:28.506
I saturated the earth with two units
of plasma taken from our blood bank.

58:28.606 --> 58:31.870
The condition of the dog found
in the greenhouse indicated blood...

58:31.970 --> 58:34.913
...was a primal factor
in the cultivation of the seeds.

58:35.013 --> 58:37.294
At 2:00 A.M...

58:37.937 --> 58:41.801
At 2:00 A.M., the first sprouts
appeared through the soil.'

58:41.901 --> 58:46.411
Five hours.
- Yes. I used another two units of plasma.

58:46.505 --> 58:51.430
At 4:00 A.M., the sprouts began
to take on definite form.

58:51.590 --> 58:53.994
I came to the conclu...

58:55.916 --> 58:59.439
I see by your faces you don't believe me.

58:59.599 --> 59:03.925
Well, you may judge for yourselves.

59:20.701 --> 59:23.184
Oh, no. It isn't possible.

59:23.344 --> 59:26.493
It reproduces itself.
- Amazing speed.

59:26.627 --> 59:29.892
This would bear out
Capt. Hendry's impression.

59:29.992 --> 59:33.575
When he saw the creature in the
greenhouse, it had grown a new arm.

59:33.675 --> 59:37.460
This pulsating, doctor?
- As though they were breathing.

59:37.560 --> 59:41.564
Yes. Human plants.
- Superhuman.

59:41.724 --> 59:45.066
All this because of the blood plasma?
- That's correct.

59:45.166 --> 59:49.393
Notice these, closer to the source of
the plasma. While these, farther away.

59:49.493 --> 59:52.897
How many units have we?
- Enough, I hope.

59:53.375 --> 59:56.038
Would you care to listen to them,
Professor Wilson?

59:56.138 --> 59:58.582
Yes, thank you. I should.

01:00:16.052 --> 01:00:18.055
Well?

01:00:18.859 --> 01:00:22.765
Almost like the wail
of a newborn child that's hungry.

01:00:22.865 --> 01:00:25.329
That's the way I would have described it.
- Doctor?

01:00:25.429 --> 01:00:28.213
Yes, Miss Nicholson?
- Would you mind very much if I...?

01:00:28.313 --> 01:00:32.621
Will you be needing me anymore?
- No. Just finish typing my notes.

01:00:32.721 --> 01:00:36.447
Return them to me.
Let no one see them.

01:00:36.968 --> 01:00:39.831
Doctor, I think you should get some sleep.

01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:41.634
There's too much to do.

01:00:41.735 --> 01:00:45.361
Your mind can't work if you're exhausted.
- My mind's still clear.

01:00:45.462 --> 01:00:49.888
No, it isn't, doctor. You aren't thinking
of what's happening in the greenhouse.

01:00:49.988 --> 01:00:53.334
He's growing those seeds in there
using blood. Just as you are.

01:00:53.434 --> 01:00:57.460
You've seen what one creature like that
can do. Just imagine a thousand.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.114
I have imagined it.
- Arthur...

01:01:00.284 --> 01:01:03.510
...what if that aircraft came
not just to visit the Earth...

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:08.797
...but to conquer it? To start growing
some kind of horrible army?

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:13.085
To turn the human race into food for it?
- Many things threaten our world...

01:01:13.185 --> 01:01:16.412
...new stars, comets shooting...
- But those are theories.

01:01:16.512 --> 01:01:19.375
This is an enemy here.
- There are no enemies in science...

01:01:19.476 --> 01:01:23.804
...only phenomena to study.
We are studying one.

01:01:35.701 --> 01:01:37.704
Come in.

01:01:41.592 --> 01:01:45.218
Hello, Pat.
- Hi. Nikki, I want to ask you something.

01:01:45.318 --> 01:01:49.264
Has anybody up here been hurt lately?
Anybody shot, stabbed or operated on?

01:01:49.364 --> 01:01:52.549
No. That what-is-it in the greenhouse
has been our first diversion.

01:01:52.649 --> 01:01:57.197
I brought up 35 units of blood plasma
two months ago. What's become of it?

01:01:57.297 --> 01:02:00.762
Why do you want to know?
- Why are they not giving it to Dr. Stern?

01:02:00.863 --> 01:02:05.049
They're giving him blood transfusions
instead of plasma. Two live donors.

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:08.256
What's Carrington doing with
35 units of blood plasma?

01:02:08.356 --> 01:02:10.097
I guess...

01:02:10.197 --> 01:02:15.186
I guess you'd better take a swing at
my chin and have a look at those notes.

01:02:15.286 --> 01:02:17.925
I should be trying to stop you.

01:02:23.419 --> 01:02:25.843
So that's what he's been doing.

01:02:25.943 --> 01:02:29.350
Thanks. Thanks for not stopping me.

01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:34.582
Pat, would you remember something?
He's tired.

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:38.824
He hasn't slept since you found
that thing. And he's not thinking right.

01:02:38.924 --> 01:02:41.790
I know him. And he doesn't think
the way we do anyway.

01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:46.317
But he's found something no one can
understand. Until he can solve it, he'Il...

01:02:46.417 --> 01:02:50.284
You know, like a kid with a new toy...
- Only this toy's liable to bite him.

01:02:50.384 --> 01:02:52.387
Thanks again.

01:02:59.719 --> 01:03:01.261
Where's Dr. Carrington?

01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:04.224
I'm sorry. I have no authorization
to give you any...

01:03:04.324 --> 01:03:07.150
I'm very busy.
- I know you're busy, doctor.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.713
I understand you've been gardening.
Where are they?

01:03:09.813 --> 01:03:12.793
Why?
- This way to the nursery, Pat.

01:03:14.301 --> 01:03:17.527
I don't tolerate intrusions
into my laboratory. Don't touch.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:20.572
This is what your colleagues
are doing in the greenhouse.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:23.537
This is an improvement.
- What happened was not my fault.

01:03:23.638 --> 01:03:26.382
We've read your notes.
You should have consulted us.

01:03:26.482 --> 01:03:29.185
I have the help I need.
Your opinion has not been asked.

01:03:29.285 --> 01:03:33.471
It has by Capt. Hendry. And I've given
it to him. I'll repeat it for you.

01:03:33.572 --> 01:03:36.277
We're facing something
unpredictably dangerous.

01:03:36.377 --> 01:03:39.642
The creature in the greenhouse
is obviously multiplying itself.

01:03:39.743 --> 01:03:41.846
We have no way of finding out how much.

01:03:41.946 --> 01:03:44.652
It will need more blood
and will try to obtain what it needs.

01:03:44.752 --> 01:03:48.216
It's imprisoned and harmless.
- How can you be sure of our safety?

01:03:48.317 --> 01:03:49.978
Or the safety of the world?

01:03:50.078 --> 01:03:54.547
Think of 1000 such creatures. 10,000. It
must be destroyed, this progeny with it.

01:03:54.647 --> 01:03:56.351
No.
- We can burn these.

01:03:56.451 --> 01:03:59.194
What about that thing in the greenhouse?
- You're like frightened boys.

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:03.320
You're right. I am frightened.
- Any destruction would be an outrage...

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.405
...a betrayal of science.
- It may be.

01:04:05.505 --> 01:04:08.649
But I'll sleep better if we get rid of it.
- Captain, Barnes finally...

01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:10.412
...got a message through.
Here's the answer.

01:04:10.512 --> 01:04:12.176
Go ahead.
- 'Fogarty to Hendry:

01:04:12.276 --> 01:04:17.625
Carrington informs me Martian alive.
Keep it alive and protect it against injury.

01:04:17.725 --> 01:04:21.309
Under no circumstances take action
against it until my arrival.'

01:04:21.409 --> 01:04:25.998
You have your orders, Capt. Hendry.
I consider them sane and intelligent.

01:04:26.098 --> 01:04:29.562
But, Tex, what about me?
- Not a thing, Scotty.

01:04:29.662 --> 01:04:33.919
What do we do, Pat?
- Try changing the Army's mind.

01:04:44.167 --> 01:04:46.330
Hey! Hey, it's me, Eddie!

01:04:51.258 --> 01:04:54.003
What are you doing here?
- We can't take it out there.

01:04:54.103 --> 01:04:56.528
Drop the idea of guarding from the outside.

01:04:56.628 --> 01:04:58.771
The wind's blowing so hard you can't see.

01:04:58.871 --> 01:05:00.974
It can go through walls as easy as doors.

01:05:01.074 --> 01:05:04.340
How could it get through iron walls?
- Use a can opener.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:08.666
We're dropping the outside guard.
- Put that hand in some ice water.

01:05:08.766 --> 01:05:11.471
Who's out in the corridor?
- Stone and Wilson, sir.

01:05:11.571 --> 01:05:17.616
Barnes, tell them they're the only ones
on guard. Tell them to watch it.

01:05:18.302 --> 01:05:20.947
Tex?
- Here I am.

01:05:21.147 --> 01:05:23.852
You won't be long.
We're dropping the outside guard.

01:05:23.952 --> 01:05:26.175
Come join the rest of them in the mess hall.

01:05:26.275 --> 01:05:30.262
I'll be all right. I've got the door braced,
and there's no outside windows.

01:05:30.362 --> 01:05:33.341
All right. If you want to be brave.

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:36.698
Well.
- Pat, what are we gonna do?

01:05:39.217 --> 01:05:41.159
Anybody around here want some coffee?

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.816
No, but you can come in.

01:05:42.917 --> 01:05:47.220
That's the reason I brought it.
I was hoping you might ask me in.

01:05:47.321 --> 01:05:50.292
Who wants some?
- I could use a half.

01:05:50.393 --> 01:05:54.008
What were you saying, Scotty?
- I was wondering... That's enough. Thanks.

01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:59.705
What happens if our boyfriend gets lonely
and strolls around and ends up in here?

01:05:59.806 --> 01:06:02.088
I've been figuring that.
- Nothing hurts it.

01:06:02.189 --> 01:06:05.362
What do you do with a vegetable?
- Boil it.

01:06:05.463 --> 01:06:10.433
What'd you say?
- Boil it. Stew it. Bake it. Fry it.

01:06:10.595 --> 01:06:12.837
That makes sense.
- Cold doesn't bother it.

01:06:12.938 --> 01:06:15.988
Maybe Dr. Carrington will ask it
to crawl into a boiler.

01:06:16.089 --> 01:06:19.785
Maybe you could borrow a flamethrower.
- Captain, I got a crazy idea.

01:06:19.886 --> 01:06:23.234
We got lots of kerosene and we could...

01:06:27.806 --> 01:06:31.623
Point three. Point four.
- Here's where we start cooking.

01:06:31.724 --> 01:06:34.675
Point five. Point six.

01:06:35.037 --> 01:06:37.886
That thing's out of the greenhouse.
Stay together.

01:06:37.987 --> 01:06:41.966
Point nine. What about throwing
kerosene on it and setting it on fire?

01:06:42.067 --> 01:06:43.744
We can try.
- Here's a full can.

01:06:43.845 --> 01:06:46.372
I'll take it. We'll need something to put it in.

01:06:46.473 --> 01:06:48.391
Here's a pail.
- Here's another.

01:06:48.492 --> 01:06:50.413
One point two.
- We need one more.

01:06:50.514 --> 01:06:52.716
Pat, this one will work all right.
- Good.

01:06:52.817 --> 01:06:54.695
Watch that cigarette, lieutenant.

01:06:54.796 --> 01:06:57.039
How we gonna set it on fire,
rub sticks together?

01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.221
There's a Veri pistol in my bag.
- I'll get it.

01:06:59.322 --> 01:07:02.977
If it comes in, you wet it down.
Mac, touch it off. And don't miss.

01:07:03.078 --> 01:07:05.482
You be ready if it needs more.
- You're right.

01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:07.421
Shut up.
- One point three now.

01:07:07.522 --> 01:07:10.897
You know how to shoot that?
- I saw Gary Cooper in Sergeant York.

01:07:10.998 --> 01:07:14.695
One point four.
- Come here. Get in the corner.

01:07:14.796 --> 01:07:17.241
Hold this in front of you.
Stay by the light switch.

01:07:17.342 --> 01:07:20.654
One point five. One point six.

01:07:21.259 --> 01:07:23.946
What was that?
- It sounded like a window.

01:07:24.047 --> 01:07:26.168
One point eight.
- Turn off those lights.

01:07:26.269 --> 01:07:29.703
One point nine.
The needle's hit the top.

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.319
Put the fire out!
- I am!

01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:03.440
Watch it, captain!

01:08:08.088 --> 01:08:10.956
Block that window!
- Hey, Scotty!

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:27.506
This will make your hand feel better.
- Thank you.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:31.966
This ought to be enough kerosene.
- Get it ready.

01:08:32.068 --> 01:08:33.865
How's it coming, Barnes?
- It'll be okay.

01:08:33.966 --> 01:08:38.028
What makes me mad is he didn't do it.
I busted it falling over the bunk.

01:08:38.129 --> 01:08:40.328
Listen, we want you all to stay here.

01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:43.441
We found a way to fight this thing,
but burned out a room.

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:47.603
It's not hurt much, from the way it took off.
- About as much effect as a hot foot.

01:08:47.703 --> 01:08:49.057
It's sure to come back.

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:52.814
We don't want to burn the whole place.
So we're going after it.

01:08:52.915 --> 01:08:55.439
It probably went to the greenhouse.
We'll start there.

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:59.158
Meantime, stay here.
Watch the door into the hallway.

01:08:59.259 --> 01:09:02.591
Keep your eye on the Geiger counter.
- Here are the fire extinguishers.

01:09:02.692 --> 01:09:05.462
Who's your electrical expert?
- That's my line.

01:09:05.563 --> 01:09:09.218
Can you hook into the intercom system?
- We can take one from any room.

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:11.723
I can help.
- Mac, we'll be in the radio room.

01:09:11.823 --> 01:09:14.145
Let us know when you're ready.
You all right?

01:09:14.247 --> 01:09:17.015
Yeah. I'd like to tag along.
- Haven't you had enough?

01:09:17.117 --> 01:09:19.640
If I start burning up again,
who'll put out the fire?

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.366
We're very proud of our captain.

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:28.839
Now, look, put one of the intercoms
here. That'll take care of this end.

01:09:28.939 --> 01:09:32.925
Put another down here at the junction.
See if they work through the mess hall.

01:09:33.024 --> 01:09:35.290
You said you were gonna
use kerosene again.

01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:39.417
Know anything better?
- Something hotter. Why not use electricity?

01:09:39.517 --> 01:09:43.462
You mean your lighting system?
- No, we can hook in a new transformer.

01:09:43.563 --> 01:09:46.268
It will give us plenty of amps.
- Enough to burn him?

01:09:46.368 --> 01:09:49.515
More than enough.
- Could you use leads to two poles?

01:09:49.615 --> 01:09:51.919
If you insulate the poles.
- Sounds good.

01:09:52.019 --> 01:09:55.444
Bob, give him a hand.
Come on, Tex. You go to work.

01:09:55.544 --> 01:09:58.569
Get Anchorage if you can.
Tell them the whole story.

01:09:58.670 --> 01:10:02.216
Tell them we're in bad shape
and to bring hand grenades, mortars...

01:10:02.316 --> 01:10:03.817
...flamethrowers, anything.

01:10:03.918 --> 01:10:07.103
Tell them if I don't send a story,
I'm gonna shoot myself.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:10.070
Better comb your hair first.
- What hair?

01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:12.874
Hey, say that again.
- Oh, Nikki, not you too.

01:10:12.974 --> 01:10:14.358
He's sensitive.
- You too.

01:10:14.458 --> 01:10:16.521
I got hair.
- Doesn't make you prettier.

01:10:16.622 --> 01:10:18.445
No, your breath.
- I'm sorry.

01:10:18.545 --> 01:10:21.127
He's sensitive about that too.
- I've been upset.

01:10:21.228 --> 01:10:26.251
You ninnies. Look. That's what I mean.
- Hey, look. You too.

01:10:26.719 --> 01:10:28.862
It's getting cold.
- The heat must be off.

01:10:28.962 --> 01:10:30.965
It is off.

01:10:31.365 --> 01:10:34.392
It's not getting oil.
See if it's the same across the hall.

01:10:34.493 --> 01:10:39.687
Tex, where do these heaters get oil?
- Around behind. Outside.

01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:42.364
Pat, heat's off in the mess hall!
- No.

01:10:42.464 --> 01:10:44.931
No more oil coming in.
- It's off in there too.

01:10:45.031 --> 01:10:47.815
Could the tank be empty?
- Filled day before yesterday.

01:10:47.915 --> 01:10:50.500
The main line could be plugged.
Better fix it.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.145
Probably run into our visitor,
who'd be waiting for you.

01:10:53.245 --> 01:10:54.867
We underestimate this guy.

01:10:55.088 --> 01:10:57.552
Trying to freeze us out, huh?
- That isn't gonna be hard.

01:10:57.652 --> 01:11:00.196
It's down to 40 degrees.
- It's 60 below outside.

01:11:00.297 --> 01:11:02.640
How long will these rooms hold heat?
- Half an hour.

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:05.243
By then, we'll be stiff.
- If no one goes out...

01:11:05.343 --> 01:11:07.207
...won't it think of something else?

01:11:07.307 --> 01:11:12.332
It'll think that our only chance to keep
warm is electricity. Heaters, blankets.

01:11:12.432 --> 01:11:15.579
It could break the circuit,
cut a line, except at the source.

01:11:15.679 --> 01:11:17.460
The generator room.
- Get them all in there.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:21.146
I'll tell Tex.
- Bring food, medicine, blankets, clothes.

01:11:21.246 --> 01:11:25.714
Bring our flying clothes.
- Most got burned. I'll see what I can salvage.

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:28.277
Get the transformer hooked up to that.
- It's cold in here.

01:11:28.377 --> 01:11:30.078
The thing's turned the heat off.
- What?

01:11:30.178 --> 01:11:31.802
What'll we do?
- I don't know.

01:11:31.903 --> 01:11:35.527
The next thing's electricity,
so everybody's in the generator room.

01:11:35.627 --> 01:11:37.811
Did you do a good job on the outside door?

01:11:37.911 --> 01:11:40.774
Houdini'd find it tough getting in.
- He'll come through here.

01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:44.098
It's the only way. Got any fence wire
strong enough for the voltage?

01:11:44.198 --> 01:11:46.183
Whole rolls of it.
- That'll work.

01:11:46.283 --> 01:11:47.825
What?
- Lay it on the ground.

01:11:47.925 --> 01:11:51.151
A lead overhead and on each side.
When it gets to the spot, juice him.

01:11:51.251 --> 01:11:52.713
I don't get you.
- Where's the wire?

01:11:52.813 --> 01:11:53.953
Down here.
- Give me those.

01:11:54.053 --> 01:11:57.360
What are you doing?
- We'll rig an electric flytrap for him.

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.479
What do you mean?

01:11:58.579 --> 01:12:00.923
Scotty, get me a hammer and nails.
- Sure.

01:12:01.023 --> 01:12:02.727
Better get out of the way.

01:12:02.828 --> 01:12:07.815
Looks as if the situation's well in hand.
- I've given all the orders I'm gonna give.

01:12:07.915 --> 01:12:11.260
If I thought that were true,
I'd ask you to marry me. Here's your coat.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.742
I wanna keep my mind open.

01:12:12.842 --> 01:12:14.422
Hammer and nails.
- Down there.

01:12:14.523 --> 01:12:18.069
Where do you want us?
- In the generator room. Move along.

01:12:18.169 --> 01:12:21.795
Sorry, changed my mind. It's all off.
- Keep moving, everybody.

01:12:21.895 --> 01:12:25.079
I want another word with you.
- No time now. Move along.

01:12:25.179 --> 01:12:28.443
Make way. Clear this out.
Clear this place.

01:12:28.543 --> 01:12:30.085
Where are those cutters?
- Here.

01:12:30.185 --> 01:12:32.529
Where's your Geiger counter?
- I got one too.

01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:34.894
Go to the assembly room.
If you get anything, come running.

01:12:34.994 --> 01:12:37.974
Get me a pair of gloves.
- Use mine.

01:12:53.381 --> 01:12:57.808
Leave enough to hook the overhead wire.
- Got plenty.

01:13:01.032 --> 01:13:05.537
Here we are, lieutenant.
- Yeah, that ought to give us a ground.

01:13:05.637 --> 01:13:08.302
There she is, captain.
- Down to five degrees now.

01:13:08.402 --> 01:13:11.145
Perfect for skiing.
- Better get rubber boots, Scotty.

01:13:11.245 --> 01:13:13.629
Why?
- Insulation when they turn the juice on.

01:13:13.729 --> 01:13:15.672
Oh, yeah.
- There's a pair back here.

01:13:15.773 --> 01:13:17.916
Where?
- Wait. You won't need any boots.

01:13:18.016 --> 01:13:20.719
When it comes, go back.
You don't belong out here.

01:13:20.819 --> 01:13:24.807
I didn't belong at Alamein or Okinawa.
I was just kibitzing.

01:13:24.907 --> 01:13:28.610
I also write a very good obituary.
Just ignore me, please.

01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:30.753
Capt. Hendry.
- Go ahead.

01:13:30.793 --> 01:13:33.177
Just hooked this up.
Checking if it works.

01:13:33.277 --> 01:13:34.982
Fine. Watch your Geiger counter.

01:13:35.082 --> 01:13:38.064
Mac, did you hear?
- Every word. I hope that's all I hear.

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:41.510
So do I.
- Here's another message from Washington.

01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:47.078
'Use every means to protect lives,
but take no steps against your prisoner.'

01:13:47.178 --> 01:13:48.521
Our prisoner.

01:13:48.621 --> 01:13:52.367
You can't ignore orders.
- Testify to that at my court-martial.

01:13:52.467 --> 01:13:56.292
You're robbing science of the greatest secret
that's ever come to it.

01:13:56.392 --> 01:13:59.215
Go back.
- Knowledge is more important than life.

01:13:59.315 --> 01:14:02.700
We've only one excuse for existing.
To think. To find out. To learn.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.506
What can we learn from that,
except a way to die?

01:14:05.606 --> 01:14:09.071
It doesn't matter what happens.
Nothing counts except our thinking.

01:14:09.171 --> 01:14:11.713
We fought into nature.
We've split the atom...

01:14:11.813 --> 01:14:14.038
That sure made the world happy.
Didn't it?

01:14:14.139 --> 01:14:17.322
We owe it to the brain of our species
to stand here and die...

01:14:17.422 --> 01:14:20.448
...without destroying a source of wisdom.
- Capt. Hendry.

01:14:20.548 --> 01:14:23.130
Civilization has given us orders.
- Get him out of here.

01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:25.535
Oh, you fools. You'll never hurt it.

01:14:25.635 --> 01:14:28.899
Go ahead.
- I'm getting a Geiger counter reaction.

01:14:28.999 --> 01:14:31.423
What's your reading?
- Point two, but steady.

01:14:31.523 --> 01:14:34.427
Watch it. Tell us any change.
Mac, anything your way?

01:14:34.527 --> 01:14:36.030
Not a glimmer.
- Watch it.

01:14:36.131 --> 01:14:37.872
Here's the operating switch.

01:14:37.972 --> 01:14:42.079
How can it get cold so quick?
- Keep moving around.

01:14:42.179 --> 01:14:45.484
It must be zero.
- It was. Next stop, five below.

01:14:45.584 --> 01:14:49.570
Come on, Mr. Martian, and get some
nice Scotch blood. One hundred proof.

01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:53.055
Nothing like it for babies.
- Tell him to cut it out.

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:58.433
No, no. Let him go on. I like
goose pimples. They keep me warm.

01:14:58.562 --> 01:15:00.987
Did you get a picture of that thing on fire?

01:15:01.087 --> 01:15:04.229
No. I shot one while I was
falling backward over the bed.

01:15:04.330 --> 01:15:06.515
Probably got the ceiling and my big feet.

01:15:06.615 --> 01:15:09.479
Capt. Hendry, going up a little.
Point four now.

01:15:09.579 --> 01:15:13.723
Hang on. Mac, any change?
- Just the same. Only colder.

01:15:13.823 --> 01:15:17.329
Means he's coming by the mess hall.
- Excuse me. I got an idea.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:18.771
What?
- Here we go again.

01:15:18.871 --> 01:15:22.776
Your boy's pretty smart. He might see
these wires and think it over.

01:15:22.877 --> 01:15:26.143
Yeah.
- If he thinks too long, we're cold meat.

01:15:26.243 --> 01:15:29.989
What if we met him by the junction?
- Let him see us there and chase us?

01:15:30.089 --> 01:15:31.789
The less light, the better.

01:15:31.932 --> 01:15:35.359
Turn off this light and this one here.
Don't tell me I'm right.

01:15:35.459 --> 01:15:38.084
Capt. Hendry, going up.
Point eight now.

01:15:38.184 --> 01:15:40.488
I'm getting some too.
- It's showing here.

01:15:40.588 --> 01:15:43.934
Both of you, back here. Come running.
- Halfway there.

01:15:44.034 --> 01:15:46.740
If you speed up that generator,
can you get more out?

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:50.386
Certainly do no harm to try.
- Bill and Tex, go with him. Nikki too.

01:15:50.486 --> 01:15:52.491
No.
- Good luck to you.

01:15:53.734 --> 01:15:54.995
What's the matter?

01:15:55.096 --> 01:15:58.922
I was wishing we'd tested this thing.
- What if we haven't enough voltage?

01:15:59.022 --> 01:16:00.925
Keep swinging at its arms.
- One point two.

01:16:01.025 --> 01:16:02.809
It's on its way.
- I got a worry.

01:16:02.909 --> 01:16:05.455
Report from the front,
McPherson has a worry.

01:16:05.555 --> 01:16:06.977
This is no joke.
- What?

01:16:07.078 --> 01:16:10.503
What if he can read our minds?
- He'll be mad when he gets to me.

01:16:10.603 --> 01:16:13.348
One point four.
- Keep moving around, you guys.

01:16:13.448 --> 01:16:15.031
Keep it quiet.

01:16:15.131 --> 01:16:20.283
I remember the first execution I ever
covered. Ruth Snyder and Judd Grey.

01:16:20.383 --> 01:16:23.127
Did you get a picture?
- No. They didn't allow cameras.

01:16:23.227 --> 01:16:26.214
One point six and going up.
- Don't move till he sees us.

01:16:26.314 --> 01:16:29.539
Give him a chance to look.
Leave me room to reach that switch.

01:16:29.639 --> 01:16:32.584
Stay away from the walls
when he hits the juice.

01:16:32.685 --> 01:16:34.588
Everybody got rubber boots on?
- Yes, sir.

01:16:34.688 --> 01:16:36.692
One point eight.

01:16:39.055 --> 01:16:41.059
I heard something.

01:16:45.507 --> 01:16:47.721
It's getting near the top.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.723
Get your posts!

01:16:58.453 --> 01:17:00.457
All right. Ease back.

01:17:14.522 --> 01:17:16.266
What the...?
- The juice is off!

01:17:16.366 --> 01:17:18.028
Carrington's turned off the generator.

01:17:18.128 --> 01:17:22.034
Bob, bring a flashlight. Eddie,
hold him off as long as you can.

01:17:22.134 --> 01:17:26.082
Watch out. He's got a gun.
- Keep away. Keep away.

01:17:26.182 --> 01:17:28.448
Keep away. I won't allow you to destroy...

01:17:28.548 --> 01:17:32.295
Turn on that generator!
Get back here, Eddie.

01:17:45.178 --> 01:17:47.323
Eddie, get back!
Stay away from that wire!

01:17:47.423 --> 01:17:50.448
I'm your friend. I have no weapons.
I'm your friend.

01:17:50.549 --> 01:17:54.053
You're wiser than I. You must understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

01:17:54.153 --> 01:17:57.420
Don't go farther. They'll kill you.
They think you'll harm us.

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.144
But I want to know you,
to help you. Believe that.

01:18:00.244 --> 01:18:02.148
You're wiser than anything on earth.

01:18:02.248 --> 01:18:05.476
Use that intelligence. Look
and know what I'm telling you.

01:18:05.576 --> 01:18:09.834
I'm not your enemy.
I'm a scientist who's trying...

01:18:10.143 --> 01:18:12.146
Hold it.

01:18:13.952 --> 01:18:18.124
Wait until he gets right
in the middle of it, sir.

01:18:19.922 --> 01:18:22.987
He's gotta be on that walk, captain.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.602
Wait till he gets right in the middle, sir.

01:19:04.362 --> 01:19:10.664
Oh, that's it. Stop. Turn it off.
- Let it go. We don't want any part left.

01:19:32.454 --> 01:19:35.860
Well, you can get a picture now, Scotty.

01:20:01.908 --> 01:20:04.134
This will take a minute to warm up.
- Okay.

01:20:04.234 --> 01:20:07.539
Is there any reason now
why I can't send my story?

01:20:07.639 --> 01:20:10.344
Only take five minutes.
- I guess it's okay.

01:20:10.445 --> 01:20:12.750
You're looking better to me
than you used to.

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.673
All done, Pat.
- Get everything?

01:20:15.066 --> 01:20:17.965
Burned everything in Carrington's lab
and the greenhouse.

01:20:17.711 --> 01:20:20.421
Burned the arm too.
- How is Dr. Carrington?

01:20:20.521 --> 01:20:22.510
He's got a broken collarbone
and a headache.

01:20:22.609 --> 01:20:24.515
I'm not getting enough voltage.

01:20:24.616 --> 01:20:26.725
I'll check the generator for you.
- Good.

01:20:26.825 --> 01:20:29.815
Anybody want some coffee?
- No, but you can come in.

01:20:29.915 --> 01:20:33.188
You better have some. You look tired.
- He should look tired.

01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:36.120
He's had two things on his mind.
- We've only had one.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:39.411
Our worries are over, while our captain...
- Shut up.

01:20:39.511 --> 01:20:41.699
Isn't there something you
can do about it, Nikki?

01:20:41.799 --> 01:20:45.432
I don't know. You know, I'm getting
pretty fed up with the North Pole.

01:20:45.532 --> 01:20:47.763
How much does a captain make?
- Not much.

01:20:47.862 --> 01:20:49.488
That's a good start. Go ahead.

01:20:49.588 --> 01:20:51.536
Enough to support two?
- Not nearly.

01:20:51.635 --> 01:20:54.227
Captain, you get flight pay.
- Some for each dependent.

01:20:54.327 --> 01:20:56.836
We can handle that.
- I won't be railroaded into anything.

01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:58.441
I've got an idea.

01:20:58.542 --> 01:21:01.693
This is gonna work.
- You ought to settle down.

01:21:01.794 --> 01:21:04.062
There you are.
- It'd be much better for us.

01:21:04.162 --> 01:21:07.031
Sure. Our captain always
getting into trouble.

01:21:07.133 --> 01:21:10.125
Remember that night in Honolulu?
- That was pretty bad.

01:21:10.224 --> 01:21:12.735
I don't know what they're talking about.
- He should light somewhere.

01:21:12.835 --> 01:21:18.837
See, they know what's best for you.
- Here we are. Plenty of voltage now.

01:21:18.938 --> 01:21:23.801
Anchorage, from Polar Expedition 6.
Can you hear me? Over.

01:21:23.954 --> 01:21:29.034
Anchorage, reception clear. Stand by.
- Press the button and speak, Scotty.

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:33.008
Tell General Fogarty we've sent for
Capt. Hendry. He'll be here in minutes.

01:21:33.109 --> 01:21:36.984
Roger. Over.
- Are there any newsmen there? Over.

01:21:37.085 --> 01:21:40.355
The place is full of them. Over.
- All right. Here's your story.

01:21:40.457 --> 01:21:43.125
North Pole, November 3rd.
Ned Scott reporting.

01:21:43.226 --> 01:21:47.060
One of the world's greatest battles
was fought and won by the human race.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.871
A handful of American soldiers
and civilians...

01:21:49.972 --> 01:21:52.402
...met the first invasion from another planet.

01:21:52.502 --> 01:21:56.015
A man by the name of Noah once saved
our world with an ark of wood.

01:21:56.115 --> 01:22:00.070
Here, a few men performed
a similar service with an arc of electricity.

01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:03.721
A flying saucer, which landed here,
and its pilot have been destroyed.

01:22:03.776 --> 01:22:06.954
But not without casualties among
our own meager forces.

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:10.708
I'd like to bring to the microphone
the men responsible for our success.

01:22:10.808 --> 01:22:16.923
But Capt. Hendry is attending
to demands over and above the call of duty.

01:22:17.045 --> 01:22:19.822
Dr. Carrington, leader
of the scientific expedition...

01:22:19.922 --> 01:22:22.657
...is recovering from wounds from the battle.
- Good for you.

01:22:22.757 --> 01:22:27.016
And now, before giving you the details
of the battle, I bring you a warning.

01:22:27.115 --> 01:22:29.571
Every one of you listening to my voice...

01:22:29.671 --> 01:22:33.809
...tell the world. Tell this to everybody
wherever they are:

01:22:33.909 --> 01:22:40.022
Watch the skies everywhere.
Keep looking. Keep watching the skies.

01:22:03.756 --> 01:22:06.936
But not without casualties among
our own meager forces.

01:22:07.037 --> 01:22:10.693
I'd like to bring to the microphone
the men responsible for our success.

01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:16.912
But Capt. Hendry is attending
to demands over and above the call of duty.

01:22:17.034 --> 01:22:19.813
Dr. Carrington, leader
of the scientific expedition...

01:22:19.913 --> 01:22:22.650
...is recovering from wounds from the battle.
- Good for you.

01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:27.011
And now, before giving you the details
of the battle, I bring you a warning.

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:29.568
Every one of you listening to my voice...

01:22:29.668 --> 01:22:33.809
...tell the world. Tell this to everybody
wherever they are:

01:22:33.909 --> 01:22:40.026
Watch the skies everywhere.
Keep looking. Keep watching the skies.
