00:07.107 --> 00:08.974
NARRATOR:
Worldwide,

00:09.042 --> 00:11.944
36 billion cameras
are watching us.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.014
On our streets, at work,

00:15.081 --> 00:18.584
and in our homes,
they capture things

00:18.651 --> 00:20.452
that seem impossible.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.655
Science says
this shouldn't happen.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.357
MAN:
Do you see that?

00:25.425 --> 00:27.693
NARRATOR: Experts carry out
forensic analysis

00:27.761 --> 00:29.294
of these unusual events,

00:29.362 --> 00:30.863
Wow! What a blast!

00:34.401 --> 00:35.434
[screaming]

00:35.502 --> 00:37.136
This doesn't make sense.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.203
[screaming]

00:38.271 --> 00:39.671
There has to be
some sort of explanation.

00:39.739 --> 00:42.808
What else is going on here?

00:44.544 --> 00:46.945
NARRATOR: Coming up,
an American street

00:47.013 --> 00:48.580
mysteriously explodes.

00:48.648 --> 00:50.382
This is incredible.

00:50.450 --> 00:53.118
It looks like something
out of "War of the Worlds."

00:53.186 --> 00:56.588
NARRATOR: A woman dreams of
being abducted by aliens.

00:56.656 --> 00:59.525
Her husband sets up
a nighttime camera

00:59.592 --> 01:01.794
and captures this.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.796
She's gone.
She's not there anymore.

01:03.863 --> 01:05.097
SZULGIT: It almost
looks like she just

01:05.131 --> 01:07.699
melts into the bed
or evaporates.

01:07.767 --> 01:11.070
NARRATOR: And has this office
building been booby trapped?

01:11.137 --> 01:13.272
I can't imagine the amount of
damage that can

01:13.339 --> 01:14.840
do to someone's face.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.477
NARRATOR: Matt Kutcher
and a volunteer investigate.

01:18.545 --> 01:19.745
There you go.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.648
With enough wind, we could get
these doors to slam shut.

01:22.715 --> 01:23.749
Violent.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.052
NARRATOR:
Bizarre phenomena...

01:27.120 --> 01:28.921
Oh, my gosh.
[gasps]

01:28.988 --> 01:30.556
mysteries caught on camera.

01:30.623 --> 01:31.990
[screams]

01:32.058 --> 01:36.061
NARRATOR: What's the truth
behind this strange evidence?

01:44.070 --> 01:48.006
Droitwich in the United Kingdom.

01:48.074 --> 01:51.143
December 9th, 2010.

01:53.079 --> 01:55.114
A surveillance camera
is trained on

01:55.181 --> 01:58.684
a sleeping couple in
an ordinary suburban home.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.988
Then, at 3:34 AM...

02:05.024 --> 02:07.392
Oh! Oh, my goodness.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.927
She's gone.
She's not there anymore.

02:08.995 --> 02:11.130
It almost looks like
she just melts

02:11.197 --> 02:12.831
into the bed or evaporates.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.936
NARRATOR: The woman vanishes
without a trace

02:18.004 --> 02:20.639
while her husband
sleeps next to her.

02:20.707 --> 02:23.809
If there's a physical cause
for night terrors,

02:23.877 --> 02:25.077
this would be it.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.613
This gives a whole new meaning
to waking

02:27.680 --> 02:30.149
up on the wrong side of the bed.

02:30.216 --> 02:32.784
NARRATOR:
Then, 12 minutes later...

02:35.922 --> 02:38.257
Oh! Wh -- she's back.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.725
LOVELL:
Wow, that is incredible.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.594
So it looks like
she just re-materialized.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.796
The husband's rolling over to
give her

02:44.864 --> 02:47.032
a hug as if nothing
ever happened.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.634
What strange force could make

02:48.701 --> 02:51.436
somebody disappear
and then reappear?

02:57.677 --> 02:59.845
NARRATOR: Engineer Nick
Householder thinks it's strange

02:59.913 --> 03:02.581
that this film even exists.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.449
Why is there a camera in
this bedroom?

03:04.517 --> 03:07.219
Were they expecting something
weird to happen?

03:07.287 --> 03:09.688
NARRATOR: Karen Bellinger
discovers a bizarre

03:09.756 --> 03:12.191
explanation for
the camera's presence.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.495
The woman says that while her
husband sleeps peacefully

03:16.562 --> 03:20.132
beside her,
she is abducted by aliens

03:21.768 --> 03:26.371
and subjected to medical tests
on a UFO.

03:32.212 --> 03:36.281
Later, she reports
being returned to her bed,

03:36.349 --> 03:38.550
next to
her still-sleeping husband.

03:38.618 --> 03:42.321
It turns out the reason why
this camera was where it was

03:42.388 --> 03:43.956
is because the husband
had set it up

03:44.023 --> 03:47.593
to try and provide his wife
with some reassurance that

03:47.660 --> 03:50.262
nothing was going on in
the middle of the night.

03:50.330 --> 03:53.198
But, in fact, the footage shows
us the exact opposite.

03:53.266 --> 03:57.002
There is something very
strange going on here.

03:57.069 --> 03:58.904
NARRATOR: The U.S. government
has confirmed

03:58.972 --> 04:02.507
the existence of unidentified
aerial phenomenon,

04:03.943 --> 04:07.913
objects spotted in the skies
by trained military personnel

04:08.948 --> 04:12.317
that cannot be explained by
any technology on Earth.

04:14.053 --> 04:16.188
Thousands of people
around the world,

04:16.256 --> 04:17.522
like this woman, claim

04:17.557 --> 04:21.460
to have been abducted,
sometimes by some kind

04:21.494 --> 04:23.195
of teleportation.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.230
They often say
they have been subjected

04:25.298 --> 04:28.333
to terrifying surgical
experiments performed by

04:28.401 --> 04:30.435
humanoid beings.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.904
There is a strange pattern of

04:32.972 --> 04:36.275
alleged alien encounters
happening in this area.

04:36.342 --> 04:39.511
Police records reveal that
within a 30-mile radius of

04:39.579 --> 04:41.947
this incident,
there had already been

04:42.015 --> 04:44.683
three reported cases
involving aliens

04:44.751 --> 04:47.386
or alien abductions,
and the following year,

04:47.453 --> 04:49.454
there were eight more cases.

04:49.522 --> 04:53.992
NARRATOR: A survey in 1991
found 119 Americans out of

04:54.060 --> 04:57.929
a sample of 6,000 claimed to
have suffered an alien

04:57.997 --> 04:59.464
abduction experience.

04:59.532 --> 05:02.267
If true, a huge swath of

05:02.335 --> 05:06.772
Earth's population is being
secretly experimented on.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.509
But mainstream science says
these abductions exist only in

05:10.576 --> 05:13.879
the heads of the people
who claim to experience them.

05:13.946 --> 05:16.615
As many as 60 percent of all

05:16.683 --> 05:19.918
alien abduction reports are
linked to sleep.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.955
Scientists now believe that
the victims are suffering

05:24.023 --> 05:26.825
from a condition
called awareness

05:26.892 --> 05:29.194
during sleep paralysis.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.564
NARRATOR: During sleep,
the brain temporarily paralyzes

05:32.632 --> 05:37.836
the body by releasing gamma
aminobutyric acid and glycine.

05:37.904 --> 05:40.405
These chemicals turn off cells
in the brain that

05:40.473 --> 05:44.543
control muscle activity
so that our bodies can rest.

05:44.610 --> 05:49.414
But in awareness during sleep
paralysis, something misfires

05:49.482 --> 05:52.084
in this process, and your body

05:52.151 --> 05:55.454
goes into this state of
paralysis just as you're waking

05:55.521 --> 05:58.657
up or just as you're
falling asleep.

05:58.725 --> 06:01.860
It's really terrifying,
because, as you can imagine,

06:01.928 --> 06:04.329
you find yourself
in a semi-conscious state

06:04.397 --> 06:05.697
but unable to move.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.733
People who experience
this frightening condition

06:07.800 --> 06:10.168
often suffer also
from hallucinations.

06:10.236 --> 06:13.939
BELLINGER: These hallucinations
could be something auditory,

06:14.006 --> 06:15.273
so, for example,

06:15.341 --> 06:17.843
you could hear a buzzing
or footsteps,

06:17.910 --> 06:20.011
or it could be
something that's visual --

06:20.079 --> 06:24.750
Lights or a strange
figure, outlined.

06:24.817 --> 06:26.485
And pop culture has already

06:26.552 --> 06:30.956
seeded our subconscious
with things like strange gray

06:31.023 --> 06:34.092
little men abducting us
in our sleep.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.228
NARRATOR:
But this video seems to prove

06:36.295 --> 06:38.330
that whatever is happening
to this woman

06:38.398 --> 06:42.968
occurs to her body
as well as her mind.

06:43.035 --> 06:47.005
What we see in this video is
a woman literally disappearing.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.976
So something else must be
going on here.

06:53.312 --> 06:56.415
NARRATOR: Magician Ben Nemzer
studies the footage.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.717
The lady's disappearing act
reminds him

06:58.785 --> 07:00.752
of a well-known magic trick.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.622
NEMZER: Magicians have been
making people

07:03.689 --> 07:06.458
disappear underneath cloths
for years.

07:06.526 --> 07:09.528
You can still see it today in
any modern illusion show.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.831
NARRATOR:
Nemzer looks for signs that

07:12.899 --> 07:16.968
a similar illusion is being
performed in this video.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.470
After studying this video,

07:18.538 --> 07:20.639
I don't think it's possible
that that's what they were

07:20.706 --> 07:23.308
doing, because in
the methods that I know,

07:23.376 --> 07:27.412
there's actually no way
to make the person reappear.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.147
NARRATOR: If this is the work
of a trickster,

07:29.215 --> 07:32.584
it is unlike anything Nemzer
has ever encountered.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.386
If these people are doing
something that

07:34.454 --> 07:37.088
the magic community doesn't
know about yet,

07:37.156 --> 07:39.891
well, this is a pretty
close-guarded secret.

07:43.362 --> 07:45.897
NARRATOR: Coming up, has this
woman been eaten

07:45.932 --> 07:48.066
by her own bed?

07:48.134 --> 07:51.937
The truth is, beds can be
very dangerous places.

07:52.004 --> 07:55.540
NARRATOR: And has a techno
weapon of terror been unleashed

07:55.608 --> 07:56.741
on a town?

07:56.809 --> 07:57.843
Whoa!

07:57.910 --> 07:59.144
HOUSEHOLDER:
This is terrifying.

07:59.212 --> 08:02.113
There's a pulsing blue light
on the horizon.

08:09.055 --> 08:12.624
NARRATOR: A CCTV camera captures
the shocking moment when

08:12.691 --> 08:16.428
a sleeping woman vanishes
from her bed, and then

08:16.496 --> 08:19.931
mysteriously reappears
12 minutes later.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.438
Physicist Chad Orzel considers

08:26.506 --> 08:29.808
a troubling explanation for
the woman's disappearance.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.177
If this hasn't been done
on purpose,

08:32.245 --> 08:34.446
how could this woman just
disappear out of sight?

08:34.514 --> 08:37.182
Has the bed consumed the woman?

08:37.250 --> 08:40.352
NARRATOR: Over 1,000 Americans
are killed falling

08:40.419 --> 08:42.454
out of their beds every year.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.524
The truth is, beds can be
very dangerous places.

08:45.591 --> 08:47.559
In the summer of 2020, a woman

08:47.627 --> 08:50.295
in England was trapped
inside a foldaway bed.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.465
[laughing]

08:53.532 --> 08:55.100
That case ended with a laugh,

08:55.167 --> 08:58.103
but this could have been
very serious.

08:58.170 --> 09:01.540
BELLINGER: In 2008, an elderly
Spanish woman bought

09:01.607 --> 09:04.976
a Murphy bed to save space in
her tiny apartment.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.813
Now, she went missing one day,
and people came through,

09:08.881 --> 09:11.917
they looked for her, and all
seemed to be in order.

09:11.984 --> 09:13.218
Nothing out of place.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.921
It wasn't until a few days
later that they thought to pull

09:15.988 --> 09:19.291
down the foldaway bed,
and there she was.

09:19.358 --> 09:20.959
A terrible way to die.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.295
Is it possible
we're seeing a woman

09:23.362 --> 09:26.631
get trapped inside of
her own bed temporarily?

09:29.969 --> 09:31.469
NARRATOR:
But the husband and wife say

09:31.537 --> 09:35.006
the bed is an entirely
ordinary double mattress.

09:36.542 --> 09:39.210
The woman insists
it's not a trick, and indeed,

09:39.278 --> 09:42.147
she hasn't sought any fame
or fortune out of it.

09:42.214 --> 09:45.984
She just wants to know
what's the explanation?

09:47.019 --> 09:49.754
NARRATOR: Experts can't show
this footage is fake.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.991
They're also unable to explain
what is happening.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.093
The woman insists it's proof

09:55.161 --> 09:57.829
she has been abducted
by extraterrestrials.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.131
But until more evidence emerges,

10:00.166 --> 10:03.068
the bizarre film
remains a mystery.

10:04.303 --> 10:07.272
This footage shows that some
really strange things can

10:07.340 --> 10:10.942
happen when we're at
our most vulnerable -- asleep.

10:13.245 --> 10:16.615
NARRATOR: Now,
Kenner, Louisiana.

10:16.682 --> 10:20.151
December 27th, 2018.

10:20.186 --> 10:23.321
A man films as a mysterious
glow appears.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.624
[explosion blasts]

10:25.691 --> 10:26.491
Whoa!

10:26.559 --> 10:27.926
HOUSEHOLDER:
This is terrifying.

10:27.993 --> 10:31.763
There's a pulsing blue light
on the horizon.

10:31.831 --> 10:36.167
NARRATOR: Whatever it is,
it gets closer...

10:36.235 --> 10:38.603
It's spreading! It's getting
bigger and bigger.

10:38.671 --> 10:40.338
It's lighting up the entire sky.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.574
and unleashes havoc
and destruction

10:42.642 --> 10:44.009
on the street.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.044
MAN: That's crazy!

10:46.112 --> 10:47.312
BELLINGER: They're scary,

10:47.380 --> 10:51.883
and they are explosive --
They're ferociously energetic.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.585
This is incredible.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.788
It looks like something out of
"War of the Worlds."

10:56.822 --> 10:59.758
NARRATOR: The man filming this
explosive display

10:59.825 --> 11:02.293
seems oblivious
to the danger he's in.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.095
WALLACE: You've got
a gas station sitting here,

11:04.163 --> 11:05.296
and you get a big spark

11:05.364 --> 11:07.032
that hits it,
and you ignite the gas --

11:07.099 --> 11:10.101
Now you got a flaming inferno,
which could very quickly

11:10.169 --> 11:12.937
turn into a disaster, which
takes out an entire area.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.939
I know I would be
running, because

11:15.007 --> 11:18.276
this thing could explode at
any time.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.115
NARRATOR: Investigators
discover that Kenner is home

11:24.183 --> 11:27.552
to Louis Armstrong New Orleans
International Airport.

11:30.289 --> 11:31.890
This wouldn't be
the first time that

11:31.957 --> 11:35.860
a major air crash has occurred
near this airport.

11:35.928 --> 11:40.298
NARRATOR: At 4:09 PM
on July 9th, 1982,

11:40.332 --> 11:42.067
disaster strikes.

11:42.134 --> 11:45.603
Pan Am Flight 759
takes off from New Orleans

11:45.671 --> 11:47.772
on the way to Las Vegas, Nevada,

11:47.840 --> 11:49.374
and no sooner does it
get into the sky,

11:49.442 --> 11:51.476
than it crashes back down.

11:51.544 --> 11:55.346
The black box recorder reveals
that just one minute

11:55.414 --> 11:57.015
into the flight,

11:57.083 --> 12:00.218
the captain is saying to his
first mate, "You're sinking,

12:00.286 --> 12:01.853
you're sinking, come back."

12:01.921 --> 12:04.789
All 145 people on board
the aircraft die,

12:04.857 --> 12:06.124
in addition to eight people on

12:06.192 --> 12:08.927
the ground, and six houses
are destroyed.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.695
It's a terrible accident.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.868
NARRATOR: The scene
on the ground is described

12:16.936 --> 12:19.003
as being like a war zone.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.705
I actually had an uncle
who was one of

12:20.773 --> 12:23.074
the firemen at the time
who worked the scene of

12:23.142 --> 12:24.109
the accident --
He said there was

12:24.176 --> 12:26.010
body parts
laying around the area,

12:26.078 --> 12:28.813
you know, just destruction
and death everywhere.

12:28.881 --> 12:31.750
Although this air crash
occurred in the middle

12:31.817 --> 12:35.220
of summer, it was really
terrible weather.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.523
There were swirling winds
and giant storms

12:38.591 --> 12:40.191
that were in the area.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.794
Investigators conclude that
the crash

12:42.862 --> 12:45.964
was caused by a microburst.

12:46.031 --> 12:49.901
What a microburst is,
is a very confined,

12:49.969 --> 12:53.004
very intense downdraft of air,

12:53.072 --> 12:56.374
and that downward force of wind

12:56.442 --> 12:59.744
can actually push jumbo jets
from the sky.

12:59.812 --> 13:02.213
Microbursts are formed in

13:02.281 --> 13:05.950
the turbulent conditions
found inside thunderstorms,

13:06.018 --> 13:09.888
and approaching microburst can
travel at speeds of up to

13:09.955 --> 13:13.024
60 miles per hour
but would be invisible

13:13.092 --> 13:15.026
to an airline pilot.

13:15.094 --> 13:17.896
There would be no warning,
giving the pilots no time

13:17.963 --> 13:20.265
to react.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.300
A microburst is catastrophic for

13:22.368 --> 13:24.702
any aircraft caught in its wake.

13:24.770 --> 13:28.039
The type of hot, humid weather
that is experienced in

13:28.107 --> 13:31.142
Louisiana lends itself to

13:31.210 --> 13:35.079
the creation of these massive
thunderstorms, and with these

13:35.147 --> 13:38.483
thunderstorms, we get these
types of microbursts.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.485
NARRATOR: Martin Morgan
investigates current

13:40.519 --> 13:43.822
flight safety rules and doubts
that an air crash could

13:43.889 --> 13:46.858
be the cause of
these strange explosions.

13:46.926 --> 13:49.928
Since the 1980s, there's been
an enormous amount of research

13:49.995 --> 13:52.497
into microbursts,
and that research has made

13:52.531 --> 13:54.566
the skies much safer.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.434
There's no way in this day and
age that an aircraft would

13:56.502 --> 13:59.337
be allowed to take off under
thunderstorm conditions that

13:59.405 --> 14:00.872
would cause a microburst.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.440
So it's not an air crash.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.409
There's got to be something
else going on.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.847
NARRATOR: Coming up,
do these explosions point

14:08.914 --> 14:12.183
to a plot to destabilize
the U.S. power network?

14:12.251 --> 14:13.852
Unfortunately, the United States

14:13.886 --> 14:15.520
power grid is really vulnerable.

14:15.588 --> 14:20.358
And in a Midwestern cemetery,
a ghoulish grave digger.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.760
GIRL: Super weird!

14:22.828 --> 14:26.998
It's digging at this frenetic
pace, like it's

14:27.032 --> 14:29.801
madly trying to get something
out of the ground.

14:38.177 --> 14:41.279
NARRATOR: A man films as
a street in Kenner, Louisiana,

14:41.347 --> 14:43.882
violently explodes.

14:43.949 --> 14:45.516
Authorities blame the weather,

14:45.584 --> 14:50.021
but the recorded maximum wind
speeds of 51 miles per hour

14:50.089 --> 14:53.157
shouldn't wreak havoc
on the electrical grid.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.225
HOUSEHOLDER:
Is this a result of

14:54.293 --> 14:58.196
the weather or are there
sinister forces at work?

14:58.264 --> 15:01.900
These systems are designed
with breakers in line

15:01.967 --> 15:03.668
so that when
this starts happening,

15:03.736 --> 15:06.604
it's a giant fuse
that bursts and prevents

15:06.672 --> 15:09.674
this sort of cascading reaction.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.010
But this event
we're seeing is just going

15:12.077 --> 15:15.046
on and on,
and the fuses aren't popping.

15:15.114 --> 15:17.248
If it was just one or two
power lines,

15:17.316 --> 15:19.817
you could write it off as
being an isolated incident.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.553
But this is going
on and on and on.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.290
It almost suggests
the possibility of being

15:25.357 --> 15:27.592
the result of some kind of
an attack.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.260
NARRATOR:
The United States is one of

15:29.328 --> 15:31.663
the most energy hungry
nations on the planet.

15:31.730 --> 15:35.900
It eats up around 17 percent
of the world's total energy,

15:35.968 --> 15:40.905
despite having less than
5 percent of the population.

15:40.973 --> 15:44.475
It's used to light and heat
homes, power businesses,

15:44.543 --> 15:48.112
keep transportation moving,
and hospitals operating.

15:48.180 --> 15:51.649
The United States today
relies almost

15:51.717 --> 15:53.551
entirely on its electrical
power grid.

15:53.619 --> 15:57.355
So if it goes down
even for an hour or two,

15:57.423 --> 15:58.856
the consequences are immediate.

15:58.924 --> 16:00.792
When we lose the power,
it's almost

16:00.859 --> 16:02.860
like going back
into the Dark Ages.

16:02.928 --> 16:06.431
NARRATOR:
In 2003, tree branches

16:06.498 --> 16:08.333
felled power lines in Ohio.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.569
As a result,
50 million people lose power

16:11.637 --> 16:15.340
for up to two days
across the Northeast.

16:15.407 --> 16:18.042
WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
the passengers in this train

16:18.110 --> 16:20.678
are being evacuated.

16:20.746 --> 16:23.781
Accidental deaths
doubled during that time.

16:23.849 --> 16:27.218
Non-accidental deaths
went up by 25 percent.

16:27.285 --> 16:29.287
That's just a one-day figure.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.756
Imagine if the blackout
had persisted.

16:31.823 --> 16:34.359
The mortality rates
would be insane.

16:36.261 --> 16:38.529
NARRATOR: America's enemies know
that a blackout would be

16:38.597 --> 16:40.865
an incredible weapon against
the world's most

16:40.899 --> 16:44.202
technologically
advanced society.

16:44.269 --> 16:48.272
WOLSHON: To have the ability
to cause these types of

16:48.340 --> 16:51.476
power outages would give
somebody an enormous amount

16:51.543 --> 16:54.379
of power -- they could
really do tremendous

16:54.446 --> 16:59.817
damage and cause
enormous mayhem.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.652
NARRATOR:
American nuclear power plants

17:01.720 --> 17:03.955
have suffered 57 incursions

17:03.989 --> 17:09.127
by unknown drones
between 2015 and 2019 alone.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.930
Could these mysterious
flying machines be

17:12.998 --> 17:17.835
scanning and testing these
sites for weaknesses?

17:17.903 --> 17:19.804
WALLACE: Unfortunately,
the United States' power grid

17:19.872 --> 17:21.372
is really vulnerable.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.675
Today, everything is tied
together through computers,

17:24.743 --> 17:26.744
and it's networked
into the Internet,

17:26.812 --> 17:28.613
and now you have
the possibility of attacking

17:28.680 --> 17:30.314
the system from outside.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.052
WOLSHON:
It's really a terrifying idea

17:34.119 --> 17:35.053
to think that a group could

17:35.120 --> 17:37.622
actually hack in
and disrupt power

17:37.689 --> 17:41.125
not just to one city, but to
an entire region of the country

17:41.160 --> 17:45.229
for hours or even days.

17:45.297 --> 17:47.365
NARRATOR:
A Russian- or Chinese-inspired

17:47.432 --> 17:50.501
coordinated attack
against the U.S. power grid

17:50.569 --> 17:53.604
could leave major cities
blacked out for days,

17:53.672 --> 17:58.376
or even weeks, leading to
mass civil unrest and disorder.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.845
Everyone would be affected by
these blackouts.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.680
NARRATOR: Shops would
soon run out of food

18:02.748 --> 18:04.082
as supply chains collapsed,

18:04.149 --> 18:07.485
and the state itself
would be unable to function.

18:07.553 --> 18:10.588
Your water treatment systems
go down, your sewage systems

18:10.656 --> 18:12.490
go down, your communications
are out --

18:12.558 --> 18:16.194
No radio, no phone, no TV --
Everything's gone.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.962
Without power, we might as well

18:17.996 --> 18:20.431
just kiss
our modern ways of life goodbye.

18:20.466 --> 18:23.167
NARRATOR: Authorities in Kenner
continue to insist

18:23.235 --> 18:24.936
the explosions were caused by

18:25.003 --> 18:27.705
a transformer on the street
blowing up in a bad

18:27.773 --> 18:29.240
electrical storm.

18:29.308 --> 18:32.643
But whether accidental
or deliberate, 10,000 people in

18:32.711 --> 18:35.847
the New Orleans area
were left without power

18:35.914 --> 18:37.281
for several hours.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.917
So an event like this really
shows you how vulnerable

18:39.985 --> 18:41.452
our power grid is

18:41.520 --> 18:44.755
and the necessity of making it
stronger and innovating it

18:44.823 --> 18:47.592
to protect against this type
of situation.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.230
NARRATOR:
Now, Akron, Ohio.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.967
June 2017.

18:56.034 --> 18:59.237
Two girls drive through one of
the town's cemeteries when

18:59.304 --> 19:02.140
a strange movement catches
their attention.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.513
GIRL: Super weird!

19:08.580 --> 19:10.414
What is that thing?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.917
It's hiding out back of
the cemetery building,

19:12.985 --> 19:14.118
but what is it doing?

19:14.186 --> 19:17.288
It looks like someone
or something

19:17.356 --> 19:19.557
is digging up a grave.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.359
NARRATOR:
The girls are terrified

19:21.426 --> 19:24.328
and don't get any closer.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.797
This is clearly

19:26.865 --> 19:29.901
no ordinary cemetery worker.

19:29.968 --> 19:33.304
It's digging at this frenetic
pace, like it's

19:33.372 --> 19:35.640
madly trying to get something
out of the ground.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.542
Whatever this is,
it's completely

19:37.609 --> 19:39.710
out of place
and completely shocking.

19:39.778 --> 19:43.548
Cemeteries are creepy enough
by themselves,

19:43.615 --> 19:47.018
but to have
this crazy-looking creature

19:47.085 --> 19:50.488
digging around
and disturbing the dead --

19:50.556 --> 19:51.856
Whatever this thing is,

19:51.890 --> 19:54.425
those girls need to get heck
out of there.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.565
NARRATOR: The digging figure
is humanoid in shape,

20:00.632 --> 20:04.702
but oddly animal-like
in its actions.

20:04.770 --> 20:08.706
Many Ohioans are reminded of
a powerful local legend.

20:08.774 --> 20:12.343
Tales of strange dogs too big

20:12.411 --> 20:14.345
to be a domestic dog, walking on

20:14.413 --> 20:18.082
their hind legs and moving at
tremendous speeds

20:18.150 --> 20:20.918
have spread fear
into the Midwest.

20:20.986 --> 20:24.555
NARRATOR: These so-called
dog men are like werewolves,

20:24.623 --> 20:27.425
but are encountered almost
exclusively in this part

20:27.492 --> 20:28.993
of the United States.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.928
These things
were reported back in

20:30.996 --> 20:33.264
the 1930s
by loggers in Michigan.

20:33.331 --> 20:36.133
The more modern sightings
have occurred in Ohio,

20:36.201 --> 20:38.736
starting in the 1970s
and going forward.

20:38.804 --> 20:41.706
[howling]

20:41.773 --> 20:44.075
FOX: One of the first
incidences were two

20:44.142 --> 20:46.544
railroad workers
who were attacked

20:46.612 --> 20:48.112
in Defiance, Ohio.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.681
NARRATOR: Ted Davis,
one of the workers,

20:50.749 --> 20:52.817
describes being struck
on the shoulder

20:52.884 --> 20:54.719
and then turning to see

20:54.786 --> 20:57.722
a hairy canine beast
with fangs and claws

20:57.756 --> 21:00.291
towering over him.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.093
A week later, a local grocer

21:02.160 --> 21:05.796
claims to encounter
a similar beast.

21:05.831 --> 21:07.231
FOX:
Sightings were reported in

21:07.299 --> 21:09.333
the newspaper, and children
were kept indoors.

21:09.401 --> 21:10.501
The police took it seriously,

21:10.569 --> 21:13.237
and they combed
the neighborhoods at night.

21:13.305 --> 21:15.606
Today, there are hundreds of
sightings across

21:15.674 --> 21:16.941
several states.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.177
Locals have reported being
chased down dark country roads,

21:20.245 --> 21:22.013
and farmers have even fought off

21:22.080 --> 21:24.515
these things
when it maims or kills

21:24.583 --> 21:26.017
their livestock.

21:26.084 --> 21:27.818
Look, there's
something out there,

21:27.886 --> 21:29.854
and it's scary as hell.

21:32.824 --> 21:35.092
NARRATOR: Coming up,
is this ghoulish grave digger

21:35.160 --> 21:37.695
hungry for flesh
or greedy for gold?

21:37.763 --> 21:41.365
When you're buried, you're meant
to be laid to rest.

21:41.433 --> 21:44.568
To think that your body could be
desecrated like this

21:44.636 --> 21:46.704
is disgusting.

21:46.772 --> 21:50.608
NARRATOR: And in a country
famous for booby traps...

21:50.676 --> 21:54.645
The revolving door just
collapses in on itself.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.213
How in the world does
this happen?

22:04.222 --> 22:07.458
NARRATOR: Two girls traveling
through an Ohio cemetery film

22:07.492 --> 22:10.795
a demonic figure appearing to
dig up a grave.

22:10.862 --> 22:15.966
Mallie Fox thinks this isn't
some predatory wild animal

22:16.034 --> 22:19.603
but a human disguised
in black to commit a grim

22:19.671 --> 22:20.805
and ghoulish crime.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.606
Could this be a grave robber

22:22.674 --> 22:24.975
brazenly digging up for riches?

22:25.043 --> 22:28.245
NARRATOR: There are more than
140,000 cemeteries

22:28.347 --> 22:31.115
scattered across
the United States,

22:31.183 --> 22:35.786
and each year, over a million
Americans are buried in them.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.422
But as we lay
our loved ones to rest,

22:38.490 --> 22:40.458
little do we suspect
that their corpses

22:40.525 --> 22:43.461
could be a target
for twisted thieves.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.799
Humans are often buried
with all sorts of valuables.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.601
So as long as we've had
a human burials,

22:50.669 --> 22:53.070
we've also had
human grave robbers.

22:53.138 --> 22:56.874
NARRATOR: Some people have been
buried with fantastic wealth.

22:56.942 --> 23:00.845
Whitney Houston was buried in
2012, encased in thick

23:00.912 --> 23:02.146
concrete to protect

23:02.214 --> 23:04.949
the $500,000 worth of diamonds

23:05.016 --> 23:07.184
that she was buried with.

23:07.252 --> 23:09.286
NARRATOR: Comedian Benny Hill
was one of Britain's

23:09.354 --> 23:13.023
wealthiest entertainers
when he died in 1992.

23:13.091 --> 23:15.793
That year, ghouls dug up

23:15.861 --> 23:18.095
his grave in
Southampton, England,

23:18.163 --> 23:19.597
after rumors that he was buried

23:19.664 --> 23:23.634
along with a vast trove
of jewelry.

23:23.702 --> 23:26.871
But a grave robber doesn't
need to find diamonds

23:26.938 --> 23:29.473
to strike it rich.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.509
This isn't just people
who have recently been

23:31.576 --> 23:32.943
buried, either --
So if you think about,

23:33.011 --> 23:35.045
for example,
someone who is buried

23:35.113 --> 23:37.448
in a Civil War uniform,

23:37.516 --> 23:40.718
those buttons that are on
their coat are incredibly

23:40.786 --> 23:42.353
valuable today and would have

23:42.421 --> 23:46.023
withstood the test of time,
and these are easy targets for

23:46.057 --> 23:49.560
someone who might be looking
for valuables.

23:49.628 --> 23:52.696
NARRATOR: One single Civil War
coat button can fetch as much

23:52.764 --> 23:55.232
as $750.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.602
Heartless looters
ransack and vandalize graves

23:58.670 --> 24:01.572
across California,
Virginia, and Kentucky

24:01.640 --> 24:03.974
in the run up to
the Memorial Day weekend

24:04.042 --> 24:06.177
of 2020.

24:08.146 --> 24:09.213
In the worst incident,

24:09.247 --> 24:12.249
robbers dug up and stole
relics from the Petersburg

24:12.317 --> 24:14.185
National Battlefield, where more

24:14.219 --> 24:17.555
than 1,000 Confederate
and Union soldiers died.

24:17.622 --> 24:21.592
When you're buried,
you're meant to be laid to rest.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.961
To think that your body
could be desecrated

24:24.029 --> 24:26.764
like this is disgusting.

24:26.831 --> 24:29.066
NARRATOR: Jade Lovell
examines the video.

24:29.134 --> 24:32.369
She doubts this is
a professional grave robber.

24:32.437 --> 24:34.004
LOVELL: This doesn't look like
someone who

24:34.072 --> 24:35.606
should know how to dig a grave.

24:35.674 --> 24:38.576
They're not using tools,
they don't have a shovel,

24:38.643 --> 24:40.010
no spade, and they're digging

24:40.078 --> 24:42.947
with this strange
backhand motion,

24:43.014 --> 24:45.015
like they're pushing
the soil instead

24:45.083 --> 24:46.650
of digging in the soil.

24:46.718 --> 24:48.886
NARRATOR: Lovell
finds a troubling new trend

24:48.954 --> 24:51.088
in grave robbery
that could explain

24:51.122 --> 24:53.824
this digger's
unconventional methods.

24:53.892 --> 24:56.694
Tragically, since the early
2000s, there has been

24:56.761 --> 24:59.263
a rise in drug addicts
robbing graves,

24:59.330 --> 25:04.001
unearthing people, and also
robbing archaeological sites,

25:04.069 --> 25:08.973
looking for valuables that are
easily tradable for more drugs.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.774
NARRATOR:
An authentic Native American

25:10.842 --> 25:14.712
war ax can fetch over $600.

25:14.779 --> 25:17.314
Drug addicts have been blamed
for the desecration

25:17.382 --> 25:20.017
and looting of important
Native American and other

25:20.084 --> 25:21.819
archaeological sites.

25:23.388 --> 25:25.990
Many archaeologists
report having to flee

25:26.057 --> 25:29.426
from armed confrontations
with violent plunderers.

25:29.494 --> 25:33.464
It's been described as
an epidemic of looting.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.834
A nation's priceless history
is going up in meth smoke.

25:39.237 --> 25:42.039
We could be looking at
a drug addict frantically

25:42.107 --> 25:46.577
digging for valuables in order
to score his next hit.

25:46.645 --> 25:49.547
NARRATOR: Does this video show
the moment a desperate,

25:49.614 --> 25:52.316
drug-crazed digger
was disturbed?

25:52.384 --> 25:54.385
When you look at the hole
that was left behind,

25:54.452 --> 25:57.521
it doesn't look like whoever
was doing this digging managed

25:57.589 --> 25:59.323
to unearth what they were
looking for.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.159
It's still quite a shallow hole,

26:02.227 --> 26:03.961
and it begs the question if
they were interrupted

26:04.029 --> 26:06.297
this time,
will they be back again?

26:10.101 --> 26:12.636
NARRATOR:
Now, Brussels, Belgium.

26:15.607 --> 26:17.641
Winter, 2008.

26:17.709 --> 26:20.277
A CCTV camera captures
a building lobby

26:20.345 --> 26:22.713
at the end of an ordinary
working day.

26:25.350 --> 26:28.218
People are leaving the office
for the day, and they're taking

26:28.286 --> 26:30.654
their time going
through the revolving door.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.690
WOLSHON: And there is
a group of men.

26:32.757 --> 26:36.093
It looks like
they're entering one at a time.

26:36.161 --> 26:39.096
NARRATOR: Then, as the first
man enters the door...

26:40.699 --> 26:42.466
Bam! Just explodes!

26:42.534 --> 26:44.401
Whoa!

26:44.469 --> 26:46.637
NARRATOR: The door is
savagely snapped shut on

26:46.705 --> 26:49.807
the man, showering him in glass.

26:51.843 --> 26:53.611
The revolving door just
collapses in on itself.

26:53.678 --> 26:56.246
How in the world does
this happen?

26:56.314 --> 26:59.683
It's unclear from the footage
if he's seriously hurt.

26:59.751 --> 27:01.118
The guy's in shock.

27:01.186 --> 27:02.686
He's staggering over to
the front desk, and he's got to

27:02.787 --> 27:04.922
be a lacerated everyone.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.590
I can't imagine the amount of

27:06.658 --> 27:09.293
damage that could do
to someone's face.

27:09.361 --> 27:13.430
NARRATOR: But what caused these
doors to close around the man?

27:13.498 --> 27:17.868
Maybe this is what we mean by
being at death's door.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.537
WOLSHON: There's glass
that's been thrown everywhere.

27:20.605 --> 27:22.272
Is this some kind of an attack?

27:25.877 --> 27:27.511
NARRATOR: Coming up,
Matt Kutcher

27:27.579 --> 27:30.247
and his team have
a shattering experience.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.949
I feel a storm coming.

27:34.285 --> 27:37.821
NARRATOR: And a terrifying
thing emerges from the toilet.

27:37.889 --> 27:40.524
That is literally the stuff
of nightmares.

27:47.732 --> 27:49.500
NARRATOR:
A surveillance camera captures

27:49.567 --> 27:53.504
a revolving door exploding
on an office worker.

27:53.571 --> 27:55.039
Man, that poor guy.

27:55.106 --> 27:57.775
It's like the garbage
compactor from Star Wars.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.177
NARRATOR: The office can
be a dangerous place.

28:00.245 --> 28:02.746
More than 5,000 Americans
are killed

28:02.814 --> 28:06.850
by fatal work-related injuries
every year.

28:06.918 --> 28:09.620
But data analyst
Liberty Vittert wonders

28:09.688 --> 28:12.790
if this is really an accident.

28:12.857 --> 28:16.226
Doors shouldn't spontaneously
explode like this.

28:16.294 --> 28:18.028
So, my first thought is that it

28:18.096 --> 28:19.930
might be some sort of
booby trap.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.135
NARRATOR: In America,

28:25.203 --> 28:29.473
over 15 perfect of all workplace
fatalities are intentional,

28:29.541 --> 28:33.577
some carried out by vengeful
workers or ex-employees.

28:36.581 --> 28:38.749
And here in Belgium,
there's a history of

28:38.817 --> 28:43.554
people creating booby traps
with deliberate malice in mind.

28:43.621 --> 28:45.756
In 2002,
a retired Belgian engineer

28:45.824 --> 28:49.393
filled his entire home
with booby traps.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.595
NARRATOR: Investigation of
the man's three-story home

28:51.663 --> 28:54.398
reveals a total of
19 death traps,

28:54.465 --> 28:57.568
including a harmless-looking
but lethal pile of

28:57.635 --> 29:01.338
dinner plates and an exploding
crate of beer.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.208
It's like a really brutal
version of "Home Alone,"

29:04.275 --> 29:05.776
where the traps are deadly.

29:05.844 --> 29:09.246
The booby traps were intended
to kill his entire family.

29:11.382 --> 29:14.651
However, he was discovered
by police after being

29:14.719 --> 29:16.920
the victim of one of
his own traps.

29:16.988 --> 29:19.757
Poetic justice, if you ask me.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.361
Revolving doors
don't just collapse on

29:24.429 --> 29:25.896
themselves randomly.

29:25.964 --> 29:28.332
Could this have
been intentional?

29:28.366 --> 29:32.202
NARRATOR: But Greg Szulgit takes
a closer look at the footage

29:32.270 --> 29:35.506
and sees a detail that seems
to rule out a trap.

29:35.573 --> 29:40.377
We see the woman walk
through the door just prior.

29:40.445 --> 29:43.714
So, if it were a booby trap,
it should have sprung on her.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.450
There must be something else
going on here,

29:49.687 --> 29:53.457
NARRATOR: Szulgit discovers that
the revolving door, invented in

29:53.525 --> 29:59.763
Philadelphia in 1888, has
a history of gruesome accidents.

29:59.831 --> 30:02.666
Many deaths have actually been
caused by revolving doors,

30:02.734 --> 30:04.168
where the person gets trapped,

30:04.235 --> 30:06.603
but the mechanism
keeps going forward.

30:06.671 --> 30:09.373
Usually, the types of
injuries that we would see

30:09.440 --> 30:13.877
in a revolving door would be
brain or head injuries.

30:13.945 --> 30:17.514
It's often children who are
the most vulnerable.

30:17.582 --> 30:19.750
In 2004, a six-year-old boy
ran ahead of

30:19.818 --> 30:23.053
his mom and got into one of
these revolving doors.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.389
He managed to get
his head stuck.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.960
NARRATOR: The infrared safety
sensors failed to detect

30:30.028 --> 30:31.962
the boy, and the door
keeps turning.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.466
Tragically,
he was crushed to death.

30:36.534 --> 30:39.102
Considering the checkered past
of revolving doors,

30:39.170 --> 30:40.737
it's not surprising
that something

30:40.805 --> 30:42.172
like this could happen.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.108
NARRATOR: But this bizarre
incident isn't caused by

30:45.176 --> 30:48.512
the doors continuing to revolve
as a person is trapped.

30:48.580 --> 30:51.582
The doors snap in on each
other, enveloping

30:51.649 --> 30:53.350
the man stuck inside.

30:57.121 --> 30:58.956
[explosion blasts]

30:59.023 --> 31:02.025
Matt Kutcher is a Hollywood
explosives and special

31:02.093 --> 31:05.262
effects expert with over
20 years experience.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.264
Action!

31:07.332 --> 31:10.100
NARRATOR: He suspects that some
kind of powerful external force

31:10.168 --> 31:12.536
could have caused the door to
explode around

31:12.604 --> 31:14.638
the unfortunate office worker.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.773
It all looks pretty normal.

31:16.841 --> 31:18.408
Just another day
at the office there --

31:18.476 --> 31:20.110
Or trying to leave the office.

31:22.447 --> 31:24.581
Oh! [laughs]

31:24.649 --> 31:26.717
That looks pretty wild, man.

31:26.784 --> 31:29.753
You know, something hits
the glass here, and you can

31:29.821 --> 31:31.555
tell it's tempered, because
the way it all shatters

31:31.623 --> 31:32.923
into pieces, right?

31:34.225 --> 31:37.527
Look at that -- the glass just
explodes around the guy.

31:37.595 --> 31:39.897
It actually snaps
this far outer one,

31:39.964 --> 31:42.032
and it slams into the secondary.

31:43.468 --> 31:45.502
NARRATOR: Kutcher notices
the people in the video are

31:45.570 --> 31:49.740
wearing heavy coats, as if
prepared for severe weather.

31:49.807 --> 31:52.843
You know, do you think it's
windy enough outside there that

31:52.911 --> 31:55.212
a high wind could slam these
doors hard enough

31:55.280 --> 31:56.480
to get them to smash like that?

31:56.547 --> 31:59.216
I think it's possible.

31:59.284 --> 32:01.251
NARRATOR: Modern buildings
are designed to withstand

32:01.286 --> 32:04.087
ferocious weather,
but could a safety design

32:04.155 --> 32:07.224
feature have gone
horribly wrong?

32:07.292 --> 32:08.825
It seems like they built in
a safety feature

32:08.893 --> 32:12.262
there that allows the doors to,
like, spring shut quickly,

32:12.330 --> 32:14.865
so they could get out,
like in the case of a fire.

32:14.899 --> 32:19.036
But in this case, I think
the wind and the pressure --

32:19.103 --> 32:21.104
Safety became an accident.

32:21.172 --> 32:22.706
NARRATOR: Kutcher wants
to test his theory.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.508
KUTCHER: We're gonna have
to generate some wind

32:24.575 --> 32:26.243
to create that kind of force,
something like

32:26.311 --> 32:28.545
130 pounds or so,
in order to get

32:28.613 --> 32:31.315
our tempered glass
to break like this.

32:31.382 --> 32:32.683
You know what?

32:32.750 --> 32:35.118
We ain't gonna know
till we let it blow.

32:35.186 --> 32:36.887
NARRATOR: Kutcher's team builds
a replica of

32:36.955 --> 32:39.389
the revolving doors
seen in the video,

32:41.392 --> 32:44.995
while Matt
brings in the storm --

32:45.063 --> 32:48.231
An industrial wind machine
capable of generating

32:48.266 --> 32:50.600
70 mile-per-hour gusts.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.837
The tempered glass doors
are designed to

32:53.905 --> 32:58.675
fail when 130 pounds
of pressure is applied.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.310
The setup is ready.

33:00.378 --> 33:02.846
All that's needed is
a volunteer.

33:05.550 --> 33:06.583
There you go.

33:06.651 --> 33:09.386
Okay, Mr. Harris, let's
get you into position.

33:09.454 --> 33:13.056
Matthew, let's get
the wind ready.

33:13.124 --> 33:15.192
All right,
son, turn on the wind.

33:18.763 --> 33:20.063
NARRATOR: Kutcher waits
for the wind machine

33:20.131 --> 33:21.531
to rev up to speed.

33:21.566 --> 33:23.166
All right, and let her rip

33:23.234 --> 33:25.669
in 3, 2, 1 -- go!

33:29.007 --> 33:30.707
NARRATOR:
The 70-mile-per-hour wind

33:30.775 --> 33:33.443
hits the doors,
which act like a ship's sail,

33:33.511 --> 33:36.313
catching the blast of air
and putting pressure on

33:36.381 --> 33:38.582
the safety mechanism
until it fails,

33:38.649 --> 33:41.685
triggering a violent
explosion of glass.

33:43.955 --> 33:46.123
Wow, man, that's pretty cool.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.724
- Glass everywhere.
- Yeah, at least it didn't

33:47.792 --> 33:49.159
shatter your expectations.

33:50.495 --> 33:52.562
You've been waiting to say that
all day, haven't you?

33:54.699 --> 33:56.333
NARRATOR: The collapse of
Kutcher's door closely

33:56.401 --> 33:59.770
matches the CCTV footage
from the lobby.

33:59.837 --> 34:02.105
Well, there's one thing we've
proved here -- with enough wind,

34:02.173 --> 34:05.675
we can get these doors to slam
shut, and violently.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.477
That mechanism on the door was

34:07.545 --> 34:09.112
totally overpowered by
the wind, wasn't it?

34:09.180 --> 34:11.314
We definitely proved
that here with the fan.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.816
Absolutely.

34:14.018 --> 34:15.786
NARRATOR: Kutcher's experiment
demonstrates how

34:15.853 --> 34:18.221
a well-intentioned
safety feature can

34:18.289 --> 34:22.893
quickly turn a revolving door
into snapping jaws of death.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.161
You know, I think
from here on out,

34:24.228 --> 34:26.730
I'm gonna avoid
all these revolving doors.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.103
NARRATOR: Now,
Alor Setar, Malaysia.

34:35.606 --> 34:39.176
October 6th, 2017.

34:39.243 --> 34:43.713
A man finds a pulsating
black beast inside his house.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.852
Ugh! just looking
at that gives me creeps.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.954
Ah, that's disgusting.

34:51.022 --> 34:53.190
What is that?

34:53.224 --> 34:56.493
NARRATOR: Its dark color almost
seems to absorb the light.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.699
That is the most terrifying
thing I have ever seen.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.702
That is literally the stuff
of nightmares.

35:05.769 --> 35:08.171
NARRATOR: This slithering
creature looks like

35:08.239 --> 35:11.308
nothing encountered
by humans before.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.876
MONTANARI: Why is it coming
towards them?

35:12.944 --> 35:16.546
You'd expect a wild animal to
be scared of humans.

35:16.614 --> 35:19.449
NARRATOR: It appears to probe
the floor as it goes,

35:19.517 --> 35:21.218
as if in search of a meal.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.820
If this thing came out of
my bathroom,

35:23.888 --> 35:25.789
I would be gone.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.393
NARRATOR: As if this strange,
writhing object

35:30.461 --> 35:32.295
wasn't scary enough,

35:32.363 --> 35:34.397
the family discovers
this thing in a room

35:34.465 --> 35:35.832
with a locked door.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.367
If this room was locked,

35:37.435 --> 35:39.636
how on earth did a creature of

35:39.704 --> 35:42.172
this size manage to get inside?

35:42.240 --> 35:43.640
NARRATOR:
The doors were bolted.

35:43.708 --> 35:48.044
The windows were closed, but the
seat of the toilet was up.

35:48.112 --> 35:51.414
It's easy to think that this
is just a one-way passage,

35:51.482 --> 35:54.017
but in reality, it's not.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.754
NARRATOR: Coming up,
slithering beasts

35:57.822 --> 36:01.191
that slide out of the sewers.

36:01.259 --> 36:04.661
VITTERT: If man-eating animals
can invade our houses

36:04.729 --> 36:06.062
through the toilet,

36:06.130 --> 36:09.132
then every man, woman,
and child is in danger.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.874
NARRATOR:
A frightened family film as

36:17.942 --> 36:22.412
a terrifying thing emerges
from their toilet.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.282
Liberty Vittert discovers
that our toilets make

36:25.349 --> 36:28.185
a convenient porcelain portal
for opportunistic

36:28.252 --> 36:29.586
home invaders.

36:31.689 --> 36:34.257
VITTERT: If a creature
can fit in the drain pipes,

36:34.325 --> 36:37.527
they can get in your house --
In 2008,

36:37.595 --> 36:40.330
a woman in London was bitten
by a rat while sitting on

36:40.397 --> 36:41.498
the toilet.

36:41.532 --> 36:44.668
She falls to the floor in
agony, saying it felt like

36:44.735 --> 36:46.536
she was jabbed by a needle.

36:46.604 --> 36:49.773
And there was a rat,
about 9 inches long,

36:50.942 --> 36:52.742
and I've got a plunger

36:52.810 --> 36:55.345
and a bottle of bleach,
trying to push it down,

36:55.413 --> 36:58.949
because there was a couple of
others there, as well.

36:59.016 --> 37:01.251
She called the exterminator
for help, but was told there

37:01.285 --> 37:03.887
was a three-week wait list.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.189
NARRATOR:
But this is no rat.

37:06.257 --> 37:10.393
It really pays to look twice
before you sit on the john.

37:14.832 --> 37:17.300
NARRATOR: Biologist Carin Bondar
suspects this might be

37:17.368 --> 37:19.236
a dangerous creature that has

37:19.303 --> 37:23.106
made itself at home in sewers
all across tropical parts

37:23.174 --> 37:25.108
of the world.

37:25.176 --> 37:28.011
Snakes can actually navigate
the entire sewer system.

37:28.079 --> 37:32.882
They can fit easily into pipes
and crevices and small places,

37:32.950 --> 37:36.286
and what's more,
they really like it there.

37:36.354 --> 37:39.556
NARRATOR: Some snakes can
hold their breath for up to 40 minutes,

37:39.624 --> 37:40.824
meaning a sewer's

37:40.891 --> 37:43.960
water-filled pipes
are no obstacle.

37:44.028 --> 37:46.429
And this wouldn't be
the first case

37:46.464 --> 37:48.031
of a snake in the sewage system.

37:48.065 --> 37:52.435
There was a case as recently
as 2020 in Thailand where

37:52.503 --> 37:56.473
a woman sat down on the toilet
and was bitten by a python.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.375
They talk about having
a snake in the grass --

37:58.442 --> 38:00.110
How about a snake in the toilet?

38:00.177 --> 38:02.879
LOVELL: What's particularly
creepy about the idea of a snake

38:02.947 --> 38:04.881
in the toilet bowl
is that they're catching us

38:04.949 --> 38:07.751
at our most vulnerable,
with our pants down.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.855
NARRATOR: But this creature's
flaccid appearance is unusual

38:11.922 --> 38:13.723
for a snake.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.359
MONTANARI: This doesn't look
like your run-of-the-mill snake.

38:16.427 --> 38:18.561
Its body is wide,
and its skin looks

38:18.629 --> 38:21.698
like it's a little bit baggy
for its body.

38:21.765 --> 38:24.301
NARRATOR: Although most species
of snake have sleek,

38:24.368 --> 38:25.702
streamlined bodies,

38:25.770 --> 38:27.737
there are some that are wrinkly.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.308
You only actually see this
characteristic

38:31.375 --> 38:33.743
on a small number
of snake species,

38:33.811 --> 38:36.946
and there's only one
indigenous to this region that

38:37.014 --> 38:39.015
has this characteristic.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.785
That is
the elephant trunk snake.

38:41.852 --> 38:44.487
NARRATOR: The elephant
trunk snake is an eight-foot

38:44.555 --> 38:48.491
aquatic species that spends
most of its life underwater.

38:50.428 --> 38:51.828
This is a snake that would feel

38:51.862 --> 38:54.230
right at home
in your toilet bowl.

38:54.298 --> 38:57.334
Their baggy skin gives them
a lot of flexibility to

38:57.401 --> 39:00.003
swim through the water,
and they're covered

39:00.070 --> 39:02.038
in pyramid-shaped scales.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.942
NARRATOR: This unusual skin
doesn't just make

39:06.010 --> 39:08.078
the elephant trunk snake
a good swimmer.

39:08.145 --> 39:10.914
It also makes them
formidable hunters.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.317
KASKY:
These snakes are not venomous,

39:14.385 --> 39:16.219
but they don't have to be.

39:16.286 --> 39:19.055
Their pointy scales means
that when they start to

39:19.123 --> 39:22.425
constrict their prey,
there is no escape.

39:22.493 --> 39:25.729
NARRATOR: These scales act like
a natural bear trap that holds

39:25.796 --> 39:29.032
the prey in place while
the snake coils its powerful

39:29.100 --> 39:30.433
muscles around them.

39:30.501 --> 39:34.037
Even pythons don't have that
kind of extra leverage.

39:34.105 --> 39:37.941
NARRATOR: Although most people
have a fear of venomous snakes,

39:38.008 --> 39:41.244
their constrictor cousins
can be just as lethal.

39:42.747 --> 39:44.881
Large snakes, when they
captured their prey,

39:44.949 --> 39:48.585
they don't have teeth designed
to crush their prey,

39:48.652 --> 39:51.955
so they have to swallow
their prey whole.

39:52.022 --> 39:55.425
NARRATOR: Unlike a mammal's jaw
that is built for brute force,

39:55.493 --> 39:57.827
a snake's jaw is rigged
with tendons,

39:57.862 --> 40:01.631
ligaments, and muscles that
allow it to stretch and flex in

40:01.665 --> 40:05.402
order to consume large prey.

40:05.469 --> 40:07.670
They've even been known to
swallow other

40:07.738 --> 40:09.572
large apex predators.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.511
Scientists x-rayed a python
after it had eaten an entire

40:14.578 --> 40:16.112
alligator and found that it

40:16.180 --> 40:19.015
took one week for it to
turn the entire animal,

40:19.083 --> 40:22.018
plus its scales, to mush.

40:22.086 --> 40:24.721
NARRATOR: Breaking down
an entire alligator in just

40:24.789 --> 40:26.256
a matter of days

40:26.323 --> 40:29.025
places an enormous
strain on the snake.

40:29.093 --> 40:32.929
The snake's heart, kidneys,
and small intestines grew

40:32.997 --> 40:36.366
to double the size
to help with digestion.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.902
NARRATOR: A large python
can swallow an adult

40:38.969 --> 40:41.137
human being
in less than an hour.

40:41.205 --> 40:45.375
In 2017, 25-year-old

40:45.443 --> 40:48.311
Akbar Salubiro
from Indonesia suffers

40:48.379 --> 40:50.146
this grim fate after

40:50.214 --> 40:52.182
his friends discover his body

40:52.249 --> 40:55.318
inside the stomach of
a 23-foot-long

40:55.419 --> 40:58.254
reticulated python.

40:58.322 --> 41:00.590
Although a python
this size could squeeze

41:00.658 --> 41:02.492
the life out of someone
in minutes,

41:02.560 --> 41:04.627
they have been known to swallow

41:04.695 --> 41:07.230
their prey
while it's still alive.

41:07.297 --> 41:10.099
I mean,
what a horrific way to go.

41:10.167 --> 41:14.070
You wake up incapacitated,
inside the body of a snake.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.840
That's not a good way to go.

41:16.907 --> 41:19.342
NARRATOR: Elephant trunk snakes
are normally shy

41:19.410 --> 41:21.978
and elusive,
but this one seems to be making

41:22.046 --> 41:23.813
a beeline for the family.

41:26.650 --> 41:29.385
A snake on its own is
terrifying enough.

41:29.453 --> 41:32.355
But if this one is extra
bloodthirsty,

41:32.423 --> 41:34.524
those people need
to get out of there.

41:34.592 --> 41:38.561
NARRATOR: The man
risks his safety to cajole

41:38.629 --> 41:40.730
and steer the snake
out of his home.

41:40.798 --> 41:43.366
He and his family
escape unharmed,

41:43.434 --> 41:47.971
but fear that this giant from
the toilet could return.

41:48.005 --> 41:51.574
If these creatures can break
into our homes through

41:51.609 --> 41:53.610
our toilets, who's to say

41:53.677 --> 41:56.646
they can't slither into
our bedrooms while we sleep?

41:56.714 --> 41:58.515
I don't know if I'll be able
to go to the bathroom

41:58.582 --> 42:00.149
alone ever again.
