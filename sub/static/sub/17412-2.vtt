00:07.308 --> 00:09.341
        Of getting hurt.
        But I only have

    One thing to say to you:
           Nut...Up.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.081
   - Shouldn't you be packing
      instead of sumo-ing?

00:16.082 --> 00:19.184
  I mean, you leave in a week
and you haven't packed a thing.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.353
           - Packing,
     my lilliputian friend,

00:21.355 --> 00:24.723
         Is 90% mental.
   So, I'm basically packed.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.658
      - Is there anything
     you're not awesome at?

00:26.660 --> 00:29.661

             Hooh!

00:36.470 --> 00:38.070

       if you could do me

00:38.072 --> 00:40.239
      A tiny favor before
      you leave next week.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.440

       a new best friend?

        I mean, it's not
     that I'm blaming you.

     kidding me right now?

      knickers in a twist.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.536
 - No! That is a horrible idea.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.137
     I'm gonna have to stop
         what I'm doing

07:19.139 --> 07:22.107
          To not only
      fix your dumbwaiter,

07:22.109 --> 07:25.644
   But also build your stupid
        kombucha closet

07:25.646 --> 07:27.045
        So you don't do
        any more damage.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.213
       - No, no, no, no.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.148
       I'm not asking you
    to build anything, will.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.451
    I just need some proper
          bloody tools

07:32.453 --> 07:34.853
         With non-stick
  bloody handles, that's all.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.756
 - Although you might not need
    my help, your son marcus

07:37.758 --> 07:40.725
     Badly needs it to help
     find a new best friend

07:40.727 --> 07:43.528
         To replace me.
  Thus,<i> the dating game</i> setup

07:43.530 --> 07:45.163
    That you see before you.

07:45.165 --> 07:50.101
     - I have three friends
 coming over to be candidates,

07:50.103 --> 07:52.504
   And marcus is gonna choose
    which one he likes best.

07:52.506 --> 07:56.208
    - You're playing a game
  to set a date with my child?

07:56.210 --> 07:57.909
   Are you completely insane?

07:57.911 --> 08:00.111
- To help marcus find a friend--

08:00.113 --> 08:03.215
        An adult like me
    who will be sympathetic

08:03.217 --> 08:05.750
       To what a special,
    weird little dude he is,

08:05.752 --> 08:07.219
 Because that's what he needs.

08:07.221 --> 08:09.254
      - Will, will, will,
       will, will, will.

08:09.256 --> 08:13.058
Your head is so far up your ass

08:13.060 --> 08:15.060
       If you think that
      that is the best way

08:15.062 --> 08:16.828
  Of finding marcus a friend.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.065
  - Do you have a better idea?
 - Why don't you just teach him

08:20.067 --> 08:22.834
  Some of your social skills,
           you know?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.202
     Why don't you tell him
          how you made

08:24.204 --> 08:26.972
      All your new friends
          in new york?

08:26.974 --> 08:28.507
   - My friends in new york?

08:28.509 --> 08:29.808
            - Yeah.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.548
    Yeah, all right, I mean,
    I met my--I met my, uh,

08:36.549 --> 08:38.283
 My asiago bagel dude, edelman.

08:38.284 --> 08:41.553
 He locked me out of the store.
     We had a thing going.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.188
 Um, oh, and then there's vlad,

08:44.191 --> 08:47.259
   My obese, eastern european
          doorman guy.

08:47.261 --> 08:49.861
       He's always like,
      "vat is your name?"

08:49.863 --> 08:51.663
  But, like, he knows my name.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.766
   Then there's the newspaper
  kiosk dude across the street

08:54.768 --> 08:57.569
    Who, like, totally knows
that I always go with <i> the post,</i>

08:57.571 --> 08:59.905
     But, like, sometimes,
       I'll fake <i> the post</i>

08:59.907 --> 09:02.173
        And then I'll go
      with <i> rolling stone.</i>

09:02.175 --> 09:03.842
           [chuckles]
         he loves that.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.811
   I don't remember his name.
      I think it's hiram.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.684
     - It...It sounds like

09:12.686 --> 09:15.854
      You haven't actually
       made any friends.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.255
 - No, I mean, not great ones,

09:17.257 --> 09:20.258
   But...You know, I-I will.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.295
      - You still got sam.

09:23.297 --> 09:26.164
- The thing is, I just don't see
  her as much as I'd like to,

09:26.166 --> 09:28.099
    You know, 'cause she's-
     her schedule's crazier

09:28.101 --> 09:30.268
 Than it was even here, but...
  It is what it is, you know?

09:30.270 --> 09:32.637
        It's still cool.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.673
   - Doesn't sound that cool.

09:34.675 --> 09:35.840
          [door opens]

09:35.842 --> 09:38.310
         - Yo, yo, yo!
       - Yo, yo, yo, dj!

09:38.312 --> 09:42.914
     That microwave, baby.
   Love that grill function.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.684
    Oh, hello, my fair lady.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.285
             - Dj.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.323
- What's with the wall of boxes?
- All right, microwave's yours.

09:51.325 --> 09:55.160
       How would you like
   to play a game for my tv,

09:55.162 --> 09:58.063
       My gaming center,
       and all my games?

09:58.065 --> 10:01.666
       - Bro, I am insky.
       - Insky and hutch.

10:03.903 --> 10:04.135
               .

10:04.137 --> 10:07.339
 To <i> the potential friend game.</i>

10:07.341 --> 10:08.707
   - Now, if I win this game,

10:08.709 --> 10:10.375
     I am gonna take the tv
         and the games

10:10.377 --> 10:13.211
     - Yes, yes, all right?
          Just chill.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.180
  Marcus, let's take it away.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.115
 - All right, potential friend
          number one.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.117
       - Yes, that's me.
          - Moving on.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.019
 - What do you mean, moving on?
 - Potential friend number two?

10:21.021 --> 10:22.687
     - How can he move on?
   Come on, that's not fair!

10:22.689 --> 10:25.290
           - Marcus?
        - Fine. [sighs]

10:25.292 --> 10:27.792
  If we're going for a picnic
  lunch, what would you pack?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.894
        - This is easy.
   I would pack peanut butter

10:29.896 --> 10:31.830
     And jelly sandwiches.
     - You just killed him!

10:31.832 --> 10:34.733
       Nut allergy, dude.
    Did you bring an epipen?

10:34.735 --> 10:37.102
 - Is it like a ballpoint pen?
    - Andy, are you serious?

10:37.104 --> 10:39.037
     Next potential friend,
          number two.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.406
 - All right, potential friend
          number two.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.742
  I'm 15 and it's time for me
       to start shaving.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.044
     Wet shave or electric?

10:46.046 --> 10:48.413
    - Easiest question ever!
            - Eh...

10:49.849 --> 10:52.817
    When it comes to close,
     nothing beats a blade.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.419
           - A blade?
        You killed him?

10:54.421 --> 10:56.655
   You're giving him a blade?
 He just cut himself last week

10:56.657 --> 10:57.889
      On a plastic spork.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.324
- I had no business handling it.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.192
 - If you guys are gonna treat
       this like a game--

11:01.194 --> 11:03.028
        - It is a game.
   That's what we're playing.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.664
        Playing a game--
         - just...Shh!

11:05.666 --> 11:07.899
    Contestant number three.
Marcus is going on a first date.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.901
  He wants to borrow the car.
        What do you do?

11:09.903 --> 11:12.237
    - I verify his insurance
coverage and give him the keys.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.105
            - Dead!
  All three of you have killed

11:14.107 --> 11:15.740
       A 12-year-old boy.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.075
     You obviously rent him
          a limousine

11:17.077 --> 11:18.843
    Because he's under age,

11:18.845 --> 11:21.880
And so he has a better potential
  of scoring with the hot bait

11:21.882 --> 11:23.148
       That's in the back
      of the car with him.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.884
          - Obviously?
  - Guys, these are softballs

11:25.886 --> 11:27.218
      I'm throwing at you.
           All right?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.054
     We haven't even gotten
   to the hard questions yet.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.321
       [door bell rings]
             I hope

11:30.323 --> 11:32.157
   That's another contestant.

11:34.093 --> 11:36.161
              Oh!
             - Hey!

11:36.163 --> 11:37.796
        [both laughing]

11:37.798 --> 11:39.731
           - Oh, hey.
          Oh, my god.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.032
     You're--you're early.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.768
       - I know, I wanted
        to surprise you.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.470
            - Um...
          - You, um...

11:45.472 --> 11:48.006
  You haven't packed anything.
          - Well, uh--

11:48.008 --> 11:49.808
            - Ciao.
     - Hey, how's it going?

11:53.479 --> 11:55.413
         - You're mad?
       Are you mad at me?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.115
      - I rearranged a lot
       to get here, will.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.483
         - I know that.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.119
    But you weren't supposed
 to be here till noon tomorrow.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.088
    - So, what, you weren't
   gonna pack up until then?

12:03.090 --> 12:06.257
     I mean, have you even
      rented a truck yet?

12:06.259 --> 12:08.827
   See, I'm confused because
   you seemed really excited

12:08.829 --> 12:10.195
  About driving cross-country
           together.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.831
            - I am!
        I'm so excited.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.500
    I got my lady, a truck.
      My lady in a truck.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.903
  - I fly all the way out here
 and I find you screwing around

12:18.905 --> 12:20.772
       With your buddies.
   - I'm not screwing around.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.774
       I'm busting my ass
     trying to find marcus

12:22.776 --> 12:24.075
       A new best friend.
        - By re-enacting

12:24.077 --> 12:25.510
        <i> The dating game?</i>
         - I didn't say

12:25.512 --> 12:27.245
    It wasn't a reach, okay?

12:27.247 --> 12:30.782
 Look, I'm sorry, but I cannot
      leave here for good

12:30.784 --> 12:33.318
  Without knowing that marcus
       is taken care of.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.819
          - Right now?

12:34.821 --> 12:36.821
 When you have your entire life
           to pack up

12:36.823 --> 12:37.922
  And move across the country.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.024
      - He's lonely, okay?

12:40.026 --> 12:41.359
   And I might know something
          about that,

12:41.361 --> 12:43.862
        'cause it hasn't
      exactly been like...

12:43.864 --> 12:46.498
I haven't made a ton of friends
          in new york.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.067
   But it's--it's no biggie.
            I will.

12:50.970 --> 12:54.506
 I just...I get what he's going
       through 'cause I--

12:54.508 --> 12:59.778
  It's like when you are used
 to all your boys being around

12:59.780 --> 13:04.549
     And then they're gone,
  it just doesn't feel great.

13:04.551 --> 13:08.553
          - I get it.
        I do, I get it.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.156
     But I have to get back
         to work, okay?

13:11.158 --> 13:13.424
 So if you can't get this place
      packed up in a day,

13:13.426 --> 13:16.294
   I'm gonna have to fly back
    to new york without you.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.829
            - Okay.

13:22.201 --> 13:25.837
    [sam's footsteps recede]

13:32.111 --> 13:33.578
            - Will?
             Andy?

             - Hey.
        Uh, bud, listen.

13:35.916 --> 13:39.551
     I, uh...I had to drop
 the whole friend search thing

13:39.553 --> 13:41.820
          To pack up.
         I'm so sorry.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.455
     - Not a problem, will.
   I've decided to give andy

13:44.457 --> 13:46.825
     A trial shot at being
      my new best friend.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.459
            - What?
              Yes!

13:48.461 --> 13:51.563
        That is so hype.
      Dude, you hear that?

13:51.565 --> 13:53.998
- Yeah, it's super, super hype.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.935
    - I need to know exactly
what will looks for in a friend.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.002
          A boyfriend.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.571
          - I'm sorry,
    you just said boyfriend.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.873
  What exactly are you working
         on there, pal?

14:01.875 --> 14:03.074
         - Focus, andy.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.509
      I need you to get me
       a picture of will

14:04.511 --> 14:08.012
    Where he looks awesome.
      Like, on the beach.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.615
       - Um, I'm not sure
  what you're going for here.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.151
  - Andy, just scroll through
           your phone

14:13.153 --> 14:16.921
      And get me your best
      will picture, okay?

14:16.923 --> 14:18.623
       - A little bossy.
           - Come on!

     - What, are you okay?

14:35.575 --> 14:37.542
            - Yeah.
    I was just getting some

14:37.544 --> 14:39.410
     Pretty paranoid ideas
       as to why you were

14:39.412 --> 14:41.045
      Putting off packing.
           - Really?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.914
  Well, banish those thoughts
            forever.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.283
   Everything has worked out.
     I got marcus a friend,

     packing your crap up.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.960
  You think you could put out
    a cracker or something?

14:55.962 --> 14:58.396
 - I-I could go for a cracker.
     - Yeah, we're hungry.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.432
 - Less talking, more packing.

15:02.601 --> 15:05.436
              Ugh.
 Man, I have just been getting

15:05.438 --> 15:09.274
           A barrage
    of the gnarliest emails.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.309
         Look at this.
      - That's disgusting.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.945
         Send you this?
       - I have no idea.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.413
       And I've got like
          50 of them.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.648
           [knocking]

15:16.650 --> 15:18.583
        - Will freeman?
            - Yeah.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.652
 - We're with the san francisco
       police department.

15:20.654 --> 15:23.488
    - Okay. Can I help you?
  - Did you post an ad online

15:23.490 --> 15:25.323
          Seeking sex
     with an underage boy?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.325
            - What?
    - No, not a word, will.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.927
       I'm his attorney.
             - Oh.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.595
      - I'm on the clock.
       And I ain't cheap.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.397
   - Uh, no, he doesn't have
           any money.

15:32.399 --> 15:36.935
  - What, no, no, no, no, no.
- First, I thought that you guys

15:36.937 --> 15:40.204
        Were strippers,
   but now...I am less sure.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.606
    - Say something, lawyer!

15:41.608 --> 15:43.041
     - Officers, don't talk
         to my client,

15:43.043 --> 15:44.575
           And you--
    I don't like that tone.

15:44.577 --> 15:48.246
         - I hired you.
   - Uh, excuse me, officers.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.349
   Does this ad possibly say,
     "lonely, bi-man seeks

15:51.351 --> 15:54.419
   Special boy, 12, for deep
   friendship in manhattan"?

15:54.421 --> 15:56.721
           - It does.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.223
        - That's my ad.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.692
             Look.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.732
 - Marcus, what are you doing?

16:07.734 --> 16:10.034
     - I'm so sorry, will.

16:10.036 --> 16:13.037
It's just that you tried so hard
  to find me a friend like you

16:13.039 --> 16:14.572
 So I wouldn't be lonely here.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.441
  I want to find you a friend
            like me

16:16.443 --> 16:18.710
 So you won't be lonely there.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.679
         - Marcus, man.
           Come here.

16:27.119 --> 16:30.121
            Oh, man.
  Hey, why did you say bi-man?

16:30.123 --> 16:31.322
      - Bi-coastal, right?

16:31.324 --> 16:34.158
   - Yeah, that makes sense.
             Yeah.

16:36.997 --> 16:40.999
             - Why?
 - Because there's 20 of them.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.767
    - Don't listen to that.
      - When they put you

16:42.769 --> 16:44.569
      On those registries,
   do they have to like take

16:44.571 --> 16:47.739
    Your picture or you just
    have to fill out a form?

16:47.741 --> 16:51.009
- Oh, man, that is so childish.
 Which is just your type, will.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.711
            All: Oh!

16:53.713 --> 16:55.680
      - We're done piling
     on the pedophile here.

          - Good joke!

17:00.754 --> 17:04.355
      - Um...I would like
        to make a toast.

17:06.791 --> 17:11.362
  I would just like all of you
      to know that, um...

17:11.364 --> 17:14.232
      That I'm gonna miss
    the crap outta you guys.

17:14.233 --> 17:20.070
   And that, uh, that no one
          has ever had

17:20.073 --> 17:22.406
   A better bunch of friends.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.742
    You're more than friends
         to me, really.

17:24.743 --> 17:28.713
   You guys...Are my family.

17:30.582 --> 17:34.685
   So...And I'd say something
         to all of you,

17:34.687 --> 17:37.588
    But I probably wouldn't
      make it through it.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.090
    There is one person here

17:39.092 --> 17:40.625
    That I can't really say
          good-bye to.

17:40.627 --> 17:44.262
  Marcus, I am not gonna look
     for a friend like you

17:44.264 --> 17:46.464

17:46.466 --> 17:49.500
