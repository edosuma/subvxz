WEBVTT

00:02.368 --> 00:05.120
Look, Dad's gone now.
We have to carry out his legacy.

00:05.287 --> 00:08.988
And that means hunting down as many
evil sons of bitches as we possibly can.

00:12.419 --> 00:14.162
- Lisa.
- Dean, ha, ha.

00:14.379 --> 00:17.084
If you wanna stick around,
you're welcome to stay.

00:17.257 --> 00:19.048
I can't. I got a lot of work to do.

00:19.217 --> 00:20.592
And it's not my life.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.171
Bela Talbot's her real name.

00:22.345 --> 00:25.049
I procure unique items
for a select clientele.

00:25.222 --> 00:27.215
A thief.
A great thief.

00:27.391 --> 00:30.012
<i>You wanna
break Dean of that demon deal...</i>

00:30.185 --> 00:32.094
...you ain't gonna find the answer
in no book.

00:32.271 --> 00:34.844
- Then where, Bobby?
- Kid, I wish I knew.

00:35.023 --> 00:38.687
I've been busting my ass trying to keep
you alive and you couldn't care less.

00:38.860 --> 00:42.394
I don't want you to worry about me.
I want you to worry about you.

00:42.572 --> 00:44.445
I want you to give a crap
that you're dying.

00:44.615 --> 00:46.822
Every damn demon,
they were all human once?

00:46.993 --> 00:48.570
Every one I've ever met.

00:48.744 --> 00:51.366
The answer is yes, by the way.
Same thing will happen to you.

00:51.539 --> 00:54.029
There's no way of saving me
from the pit, is there?

00:54.416 --> 00:55.791
No.

01:53.804 --> 01:56.556
Oh! I'm sorry.

02:00.644 --> 02:02.138
Sir?

02:08.943 --> 02:10.485
Wake up.

02:15.617 --> 02:17.573
Wake up, you hear me? Wake up.

02:17.743 --> 02:18.822
Sir, wake up!

02:18.994 --> 02:21.450
Help! I need some help in here!

02:30.297 --> 02:31.755
Cheers.

02:52.317 --> 02:54.523
There you are. What are you doing?

02:56.154 --> 02:57.269
Having a drink.

02:58.198 --> 03:00.189
It's 2 in the afternoon.
Drinking whiskey?

03:00.365 --> 03:02.025
- I drink all the time.
- No, you don't.

03:02.201 --> 03:03.232
What's the big deal?

03:03.410 --> 03:07.787
You get sloppy in bars, you hit on chicks
all the time. Why can't I?

03:09.833 --> 03:12.159
It's kind of slim pickings around here.

03:12.585 --> 03:14.376
What's going on with you?

03:19.091 --> 03:20.420
I tried, Dean.

03:21.928 --> 03:24.679
- To do what?
- To save you.

03:29.059 --> 03:30.932
Could I get a whiskey, double, neat.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.220
- I'm serious, Dean.
- No, you're drunk.

03:33.396 --> 03:35.638
I mean, where you're going...

03:36.066 --> 03:38.224
...what you're gonna become.

03:40.819 --> 03:42.859
I can't stop it.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.990
I'm starting to think
maybe even Ruby can't stop it.

03:49.662 --> 03:52.283
But really, the thing is,
no one can save you.

03:52.456 --> 03:54.745
- I've been telling you.
- No, that's not what I mean.

03:54.916 --> 03:57.917
I mean, no one can save you
because you don't wanna be saved.

03:59.170 --> 04:02.290
I mean, how can you care so little
about yourself?

04:03.716 --> 04:05.709
What's wrong with you?

04:11.098 --> 04:12.722
Hello?

04:13.433 --> 04:16.007
Yes, this is Mr. Sniderson.

04:18.397 --> 04:19.939
What?

04:20.732 --> 04:22.060
Where?

04:28.948 --> 04:30.406
So, what's the diagnosis?

04:30.574 --> 04:32.733
We've tested everything
we can think to test.

04:32.910 --> 04:35.579
- He seems perfectly healthy.
- Except that he's comatose.

04:35.746 --> 04:39.079
Mr. Sniderson,
you're his emergency contact.

04:39.249 --> 04:41.325
Anything we should know?
Any illnesses?

04:41.501 --> 04:44.704
No, he never gets sick.
I mean, he doesn't even catch cold.

04:45.171 --> 04:48.089
Doctor, is there anything you can do?

04:48.967 --> 04:52.714
Look, I'm sorry, but we don't know
what's causing it...

04:52.886 --> 04:55.342
...so we don't know how to treat it.

04:55.514 --> 04:57.091
He just...

04:57.516 --> 05:00.967
...went to sleep and didn't wake up.

05:11.112 --> 05:13.318
So, what was Bobby doing
in Pittsburgh?

05:13.489 --> 05:16.490
Unless he was taking
an extremely lame vacation...

05:16.659 --> 05:19.493
I mean, he must have
been working a job, right?

05:19.661 --> 05:24.738
Well, you think there'd be some
sort of sign or something, you know?

05:25.667 --> 05:29.499
Research, news clippings...

05:31.881 --> 05:34.834
Or a frigging pizza box or a beer can.

05:44.727 --> 05:46.600
How about this?

05:50.523 --> 05:52.681
Good old Bobby,
always covering up his tracks.

05:52.859 --> 05:55.231
You make heads or tails
of any of this?

05:58.906 --> 06:02.985
<i>"Silene capensis," which, of course,
means absolutely nothing to me.</i>

06:03.160 --> 06:05.033
Here, obit.

06:05.871 --> 06:09.571
"Dr. Walter Gregg, 64,
university neurologist. "

06:09.749 --> 06:12.454
- How'd he bite it?
- Um, actually, they don't know.

06:12.627 --> 06:15.297
They say he just went to sleep
and didn't wake up.

06:16.922 --> 06:18.915
That sound familiar to you?

06:19.091 --> 06:20.585
All right, um...

06:21.260 --> 06:23.466
So let's say Bobby was looking
into the doc's death.

06:23.637 --> 06:25.844
- Hunting after something...
- That started hunting him.

06:26.015 --> 06:27.094
Yeah.

06:27.266 --> 06:29.093
See if you can make
heads or tails of this.

06:29.268 --> 06:32.636
- What are you gonna do?
- Look into the good doctor myself.

06:36.149 --> 06:38.604
So you're Dr. Gregg's lab assistant?

06:38.776 --> 06:40.520
That's right.

06:41.154 --> 06:44.273
Well, his death must have come
as a shock to you.

06:44.448 --> 06:45.906
Yeah, it did.

06:46.074 --> 06:49.693
But, still, go in your sleep, peaceful...
That's what you wish for, right?

06:49.870 --> 06:51.530
Yeah. Right.

06:51.913 --> 06:55.863
Dr. Gregg, uh,
studied sleeping disorders?

06:56.043 --> 06:57.157
Dreams?

06:57.336 --> 07:00.335
I don't understand. I went over this
with the other detective.

07:00.504 --> 07:04.123
- You spoke to another detective?
- Yes. A very nice older man with a beard.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.842
Well, I'd love to hear it again.

07:06.010 --> 07:09.094
Thing is, I'm sort of busy.
Maybe we could do this later?

07:10.431 --> 07:12.009
Sure. Yeah.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.589
Just bring you down to the station
later this afternoon.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.437
Get your statement on tape,
do it all official-like.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.731
Look, okay, I didn't know
about Dr. Gregg's experiments.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.901
- Not until I was cleaning out his files.
- His experiments, uh...?

07:25.070 --> 07:27.357
The ones he was conducting
on sleeping?

07:27.529 --> 07:30.981
No one knew, okay?
Not the university, not anybody.

07:31.241 --> 07:35.619
I already spoke with a lawyer, he told
me I can't be held liable for anything.

07:36.330 --> 07:40.030
Maybe you couldn't, but that was
before the new evidence came to light.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.536
- New evidence?
- Mm-hm.

07:41.709 --> 07:43.037
What new evidence?

07:44.921 --> 07:46.545
I'm not at liberty to say.

07:47.965 --> 07:50.752
Look, I'm just a grad student,
this was a gig to cover tuition.

07:50.927 --> 07:54.130
Maybe so. But, uh, still...

07:54.347 --> 07:57.015
...this could go
on your permanent record.

07:57.599 --> 07:59.971
Unless you hand over
the doctor's research to me.

08:00.143 --> 08:01.518
All of it.

08:04.481 --> 08:08.348
Look, I don't know what the RA said,
but, ahh, I was growing ferns.

08:08.525 --> 08:11.016
Ha. Take it easy, Phish,
that's not why I'm here.

08:11.195 --> 08:12.737
Really?

08:12.905 --> 08:14.565
Oh, thank God. Okay.

08:14.949 --> 08:17.440
I wanna talk to you
about Dr. Gregg's sleep study.

08:17.618 --> 08:19.445
Yeah. Dr. Gregg just died, right?

08:19.620 --> 08:22.537
- You were one of his test subjects?
- Yeah.

08:25.750 --> 08:29.664
Unless you're on duty or whatever?

08:31.214 --> 08:33.787
I guess I can make an exception.

08:45.560 --> 08:49.938
Now, Dr. Gregg was testing treatments
for a, uh, "Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome"?

08:50.107 --> 08:51.137
Which means...?

08:51.315 --> 08:52.595
Um, I, uh...

08:52.775 --> 08:54.234
I can't dream.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.809
I had this bike accident
when I was a kid...

08:56.987 --> 09:01.115
...and I banged my head pretty good
and I haven't had a dream since.

09:01.826 --> 09:04.530
Till the study. You know. Sort of.

09:04.703 --> 09:07.490
- What'd the doc give you?
- It's this yellow tea.

09:07.664 --> 09:10.534
- It smelled awful, tasted worse.
- What did it do?

09:10.708 --> 09:12.831
Just passed right out.

09:13.002 --> 09:17.581
And I had the most vivid,
super-intense dream.

09:17.757 --> 09:20.757
- Like a bad acid trip, you know?
- Totally.

09:20.926 --> 09:22.918
- I mean, no.
- That was it.

09:23.345 --> 09:28.340
I dropped out of the study
right after that. I didn't like it.

09:28.642 --> 09:30.765
To tell you the truth...

09:31.061 --> 09:32.935
...it kind of scared me.

09:47.076 --> 09:48.783
How is he?

09:49.244 --> 09:51.913
No change. What you got?

09:52.080 --> 09:55.200
Well, considering what you told me
about the doc's experiments...

09:55.375 --> 09:57.700
...Bobby's wall is starting to make
a lot more sense.

09:57.877 --> 09:59.751
<i>- How so?
- This plant, Silene capensis...</i>

09:59.921 --> 10:01.580
...is also known as African Dream Root.

10:01.755 --> 10:04.425
It's been used by shaman
and medicine men for centuries.

10:04.591 --> 10:06.002
Let me guess. They dose up...

10:06.176 --> 10:08.846
...bust out didjeridus,
start kicking around the hackey.

10:09.012 --> 10:11.338
Not quite.
If you believe the legends...

10:11.515 --> 10:13.009
...it's used for dreamwalking.

10:13.183 --> 10:16.267
Entering another person's dreams,
poking around in their heads.

10:16.436 --> 10:18.594
- I take it we believe the legends?
- When don't we?

10:18.771 --> 10:21.558
- Dreamwalking's the tip of the iceberg.
- What do you mean?

10:21.732 --> 10:24.223
Dream Root is serious mojo.
You take enough of it...

10:24.402 --> 10:26.975
...with practice,
you become a regular Freddy Krueger.

10:27.155 --> 10:28.400
You can control anything.

10:28.573 --> 10:32.071
You could turn bad dreams good,
you could turn good dreams bad.

10:32.242 --> 10:34.448
And killing people in their sleep?

10:34.619 --> 10:36.528
For example.

10:36.746 --> 10:40.530
So let's say this doc was testing this
stuff on his patients, Tim Leary-style.

10:40.709 --> 10:43.874
Somebody gets pissed at him,
decides to give him a dream visit...

10:44.044 --> 10:45.242
...he goes nighty-night.

10:45.421 --> 10:46.998
What about Bobby?

10:47.172 --> 10:50.791
I mean, if the killer came after him,
how come he's still alive?

10:51.260 --> 10:53.003
I don't know.

11:05.273 --> 11:06.767
Help me!

11:06.941 --> 11:08.815
Somebody help me!

11:08.985 --> 11:11.606
Help me!

11:20.411 --> 11:22.784
So how do we find
our homicidal sandman?

11:22.956 --> 11:24.236
- Could be anyone.
- Yeah?

11:24.415 --> 11:27.415
Yeah, anyone who knew the doctor
and had access to his dream shrooms.

11:27.584 --> 11:29.244
Maybe one of his test subjects?

11:29.419 --> 11:32.337
Possible. But his research was
pretty sketchy. I mean...

11:32.506 --> 11:36.041
...I don't know how many subjects
he had or who all of them were.

11:36.218 --> 11:37.249
What?

11:37.427 --> 11:41.376
Any other case, we'd be calling Bobby
and asking him for help right now.

11:41.639 --> 11:43.014
You know what? You're right.

11:43.182 --> 11:44.641
- What?
- Let's go talk to him.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.765
Sure, I think we might find
the conversation a bit one-sided.

11:48.938 --> 11:51.061
Not if we're tripping
on some Dream Root.

11:51.232 --> 11:52.975
- What?
- You heard me.

11:53.150 --> 11:55.059
You wanna go dreamwalking
inside Bobby's head?

11:55.235 --> 11:58.070
- Yeah. Maybe we could help.
- We have no idea what's in there.

11:58.238 --> 11:59.518
- How bad could it be?
- Bad.

12:00.323 --> 12:01.983
Dude, it's Bobby.

12:04.411 --> 12:06.237
Yeah, you're right.

12:07.622 --> 12:10.242
One problem, we're fresh out
of African Dream Root.

12:10.416 --> 12:13.333
So unless you know someone
who can score some...

12:13.794 --> 12:14.825
- Crap.
- What?

12:15.003 --> 12:16.332
- Bela.
- Bela?

12:16.505 --> 12:17.880
Crap.

12:18.048 --> 12:19.211
Huh.

12:19.383 --> 12:23.296
- You're suggesting we ask her a favor?
- I feel dirty thinking about it, but yeah.

12:45.699 --> 12:47.109
Hey, Sam.

12:47.951 --> 12:50.951
Bela, I didn't think there's a chance
in hell you'd show up.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.741
Well, I'm full of surprises.

12:53.914 --> 12:55.325
Though, truthfully...

12:55.499 --> 12:57.658
...you wanna know why I'm here?

12:58.085 --> 12:59.745
Okay.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.331
Because of you.

13:03.841 --> 13:06.960
- Uh, what are you doing?
- I can't stop thinking about you.

13:07.135 --> 13:08.712
What?

13:12.640 --> 13:13.803
Are you sure?

13:17.520 --> 13:20.140
Sam. Sam. Sam. Oh.

13:20.313 --> 13:22.306
Sam, wake up!

13:30.574 --> 13:31.605
Dude, you were out.

13:32.325 --> 13:34.282
Making some serious happy noises.

13:34.452 --> 13:37.369
- Who were you dreaming about?
- What? No one. Nothing.

13:37.538 --> 13:40.290
- You can tell me. Angelina Jolie?
- No.

13:40.458 --> 13:42.699
- Brad Pitt?
- No. No.

13:42.877 --> 13:45.083
- It doesn't matter.
- Whatever.

13:45.254 --> 13:48.170
- Whatever.
- I called Bela.

13:50.008 --> 13:51.799
Bela? Yeah?

13:52.760 --> 13:55.845
What'd she, you know, say?

13:56.014 --> 13:58.090
She gonna help us?

13:58.683 --> 14:01.255
Shockingly, no,
which puts us back to square one.

14:01.435 --> 14:03.677
I've been trying to decipher
the doctor's notes.

14:03.854 --> 14:06.808
Unfortunately, he has worse handwriting
than you do.

14:08.650 --> 14:10.773
You wanna come help me
with this stuff?

14:12.404 --> 14:15.025
Yeah, yeah. Just give me a sec.

14:30.253 --> 14:34.547
- Bela. As I live and breathe.
- You called me. Remember?

14:35.300 --> 14:36.794
I remember you turning me down.

14:36.968 --> 14:38.925
Well, I'm just full of surprises.

14:39.721 --> 14:41.760
Hey, Bela. What's going on?

14:41.931 --> 14:44.421
I brought you your African Dream Root.

14:44.600 --> 14:48.183
Nasty stuff, and not easy to come by.

14:48.354 --> 14:49.896
Why the sudden change of heart?

14:50.064 --> 14:52.733
What, I can't do you a little favor
every now and again?

14:52.900 --> 14:54.275
No. You can't.

14:55.069 --> 14:58.318
Come on, I wanna know what
the strings are before you attach them.

14:58.488 --> 15:00.860
You said this was
for Bobby Singer, right?

15:01.032 --> 15:03.653
Well. I'm doing it for him, not you.

15:04.243 --> 15:06.070
Bobby? Why?

15:07.705 --> 15:09.532
He saved my life once.

15:09.707 --> 15:11.499
In Flagstaff.

15:14.044 --> 15:16.795
I screwed up and he saved me, okay?
You satisfied?

15:18.089 --> 15:19.714
Maybe.

15:20.091 --> 15:22.665
So when do we go on this
little magical mystery tour?

15:22.844 --> 15:24.255
Oh, you're not going anywhere.

15:24.429 --> 15:27.963
I don't trust you enough to let you
in my car, much less Bobby's head.

15:28.349 --> 15:29.759
No offense.

15:31.560 --> 15:32.591
None taken.

15:36.190 --> 15:39.274
- It's 2 a. m. Where am I supposed to go?
- Get a room.

15:39.859 --> 15:44.106
<i>They got the Magic Fingers, Casa Erotica
on pay-per-view. You'll love it.</i>

15:44.280 --> 15:45.774
You...

15:46.950 --> 15:49.238
Nice to... Seeing you...

15:49.911 --> 15:51.191
...Bela.

16:00.128 --> 16:04.707
<i>Should we dim the lights and synch up
Wizard of Oz to Dark Side of the Moon?</i>

16:04.883 --> 16:05.962
Why?

16:07.052 --> 16:09.459
What did you do during college?

16:09.762 --> 16:11.553
Wait, wait, wait.

16:11.722 --> 16:13.549
Can't forget this.

16:14.767 --> 16:16.309
Here.

16:17.186 --> 16:19.226
- What the hell is that?
- Bobby's hair.

16:20.106 --> 16:21.564
We have to drink Bobby's hair?

16:21.732 --> 16:25.432
That's how you control whose dream
you're entering. Drink some of their...

16:26.778 --> 16:27.976
Some of their body.

16:29.864 --> 16:33.280
Well, guess the hair of the dog
is better than other parts of the body.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.280
- Bottoms up.
- Yeah.

16:50.758 --> 16:52.466
Feel anything?

16:53.553 --> 16:54.667
No.

16:54.846 --> 16:56.803
You feel anything?

16:57.223 --> 16:58.717
No.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.926
Maybe we got some bad shwag.

17:04.188 --> 17:06.559
Hey, when did it start raining?

17:18.285 --> 17:21.035
When did it start raining upside down?

17:31.839 --> 17:35.289
Okay, I don't know what's weirder,
the fact that we're in Bobby's head...

17:35.466 --> 17:37.755
<i>...or that he's dreaming of
Better Homes and Gardens.</i>

17:37.927 --> 17:41.343
Wait. Wait a sec.
Imagine the place without the paint job.

17:41.514 --> 17:46.093
More cluttered, dusty,
books all over the place.

17:47.352 --> 17:49.926
- It's Bobby's house.
- Yeah.

17:50.272 --> 17:52.063
Bobby?

18:06.287 --> 18:08.114
Bobby?

18:11.584 --> 18:13.126
Dean?

18:14.753 --> 18:17.160
- I'm gonna go look outside.
- No, no, stay close.

18:17.338 --> 18:19.746
Dude, I'll be fine.
Just look around in here.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.751
Look, we gotta find him.

18:22.343 --> 18:24.419
Don't do anything stupid.

18:53.998 --> 18:55.658
Dean!

19:01.963 --> 19:03.541
Dean!

19:21.523 --> 19:23.183
Bobby?

19:28.029 --> 19:29.606
Bobby.

19:35.745 --> 19:37.737
Who's out there?

19:44.586 --> 19:46.579
Bobby, you in there?

19:46.796 --> 19:48.872
Dean?
- Yeah. It's me. Open up.

19:49.049 --> 19:50.543
Hey.

19:53.303 --> 19:54.844
How in the hell did you find me?

19:55.012 --> 19:57.337
Sam and I got our hands on
some of that Dream Root stuff.

19:57.514 --> 19:59.092
Dream Root? What?

19:59.266 --> 20:01.259
Dr. Gregg, the experiments?

20:01.435 --> 20:03.760
What the hell are you talking about?

20:04.563 --> 20:05.642
Hurry.

20:05.814 --> 20:07.190
- What's going on?
- She's coming.

20:07.358 --> 20:09.729
Okay, you know this is a dream,
don't you?

20:09.901 --> 20:12.736
- What are you, crazy?
- It's a dream, none of this is real.

20:12.904 --> 20:15.110
Does that look made-up?

20:21.787 --> 20:24.028
Bobby, who is that?

20:24.456 --> 20:27.706
She's... She's my wife.

20:54.734 --> 20:55.765
Why, Bobby?

20:57.153 --> 20:59.822
Why did you do this to me?

21:02.950 --> 21:05.072
I would rather die myself
than hurt you.

21:05.243 --> 21:06.868
But you did hurt me.

21:07.662 --> 21:09.489
You shoved that knife into me.

21:11.166 --> 21:14.083
Again and again.

21:15.211 --> 21:16.622
You watched me bleed.

21:18.006 --> 21:19.167
Watched me die.

21:20.257 --> 21:23.708
- Bobby, she's not real.
- How could you?

21:24.511 --> 21:28.212
You were possessed, baby.
You were rabid.

21:28.390 --> 21:30.597
And I didn't know what I know now.

21:30.976 --> 21:33.300
- I didn't know how to save you.
You're lying.

21:33.478 --> 21:34.972
You wanted me dead.

21:35.855 --> 21:38.013
If you'd loved me,
you would've found a way.

21:38.191 --> 21:40.148
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.

21:52.704 --> 21:54.661
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

21:55.123 --> 21:56.202
You don't belong here.

21:56.374 --> 21:58.663
You're one to talk.
You're in my friend's head.

21:58.835 --> 22:02.535
You got a poor choice in friends.
This is self-defense. He came after me.

22:02.713 --> 22:04.172
He wanted to hurt me.

22:04.340 --> 22:05.964
Maybe because you're a killer.

22:06.550 --> 22:08.757
You should be nicer to me.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.671
In here...

22:10.846 --> 22:13.681
...you're just an insect. I'm a god.

22:15.725 --> 22:19.936
I'm telling you, all of it.
Your house, your wife, it's a nightmare.

22:23.316 --> 22:24.858
- I killed her.
- Bobby!

22:25.193 --> 22:28.976
This is your dream that you can wake up.
I mean, hell, you can do anything.

22:29.154 --> 22:32.653
Just leave me alone.
Let her kill me already.

22:32.824 --> 22:36.443
Look at me. You snap out of this now.
You gotta snap out of this now.

22:36.620 --> 22:39.075
You're not gonna die.
I'm not gonna let you die.

22:39.247 --> 22:41.370
You're like a father to me.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.494
You gotta believe me, please.

22:48.047 --> 22:51.546
- I'm dreaming?
- Yes. Now take control of it.

23:11.944 --> 23:13.106
I don't believe it.

23:16.740 --> 23:18.483
Believe it.

23:20.285 --> 23:21.614
Now would you please wake up?

23:21.787 --> 23:23.115
Sweet dreams.

23:39.469 --> 23:41.343
Hey, Bobby.

23:42.097 --> 23:43.805
That, uh...

23:44.057 --> 23:46.050
That stuff,
all that stuff with your wife?

23:48.561 --> 23:50.471
That actually happen?

23:53.607 --> 23:56.643
Everybody got into hunting somehow.

23:58.112 --> 24:00.235
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

24:00.406 --> 24:02.861
If it weren't for you,
I'd still be lost in there.

24:03.033 --> 24:04.777
Or dead.

24:06.787 --> 24:08.066
Thank you.

24:15.753 --> 24:20.000
So, uh, stoner boy wasn't in his dorm.
My guess is he's long gone by now.

24:20.174 --> 24:22.130
- He ain't much of a stoner.
- No?

24:22.300 --> 24:24.922
No. His name's Jeremy Frost.

24:25.095 --> 24:27.847
Full-on genius. Hundred-and-sixty IQ.

24:28.014 --> 24:32.344
Which is saying something, considering
his dad took a baseball bat to his head.

24:32.519 --> 24:34.310
Here's Father of the Year.

24:35.063 --> 24:37.683
- He died before Jeremy was 10.
- Looks like a real sweetheart.

24:37.857 --> 24:41.107
Injury gave him Charcot-Wilbrand,
he hasn't dreamt since.

24:41.277 --> 24:44.480
- Till he started dosing the dream drug.
- Yep.

24:44.655 --> 24:47.609
How'd he know how to dig up your
worst nightmare and throw it at you?

24:47.783 --> 24:50.736
He was rooting around in my skull.
God knows what he saw in there.

24:50.910 --> 24:52.191
How'd he get in there?

24:52.370 --> 24:54.446
Isn't he supposed to have
your DNA or something?

24:54.622 --> 24:56.081
- Yeah.
Yeah.

24:56.791 --> 24:59.662
Before I knew it was him,
he offered me a beer.

24:59.836 --> 25:01.579
I drank it.

25:01.754 --> 25:04.458
Dumbest frigging thing.

25:04.756 --> 25:07.378
Oh, I don't know.
It wasn't that dumb. Ha.

25:08.677 --> 25:10.385
- Dean, you didn't.
- I was thirsty.

25:10.554 --> 25:12.712
Great, now he can come after
either one of you.

25:12.889 --> 25:14.549
We'll just have to find him first.

25:15.684 --> 25:18.553
We better work fast and coffee up.

25:18.728 --> 25:22.097
Because one thing we cannot do
is fall asleep.

25:26.569 --> 25:30.401
This Jeremy guy's not a frigging ghost.
Where the hell could he be?

25:31.240 --> 25:34.026
You sure you don't want me to drive?
You seem a little...

25:34.200 --> 25:36.323
...caffeinated.
- Thanks for the news flash, Edison.

25:41.875 --> 25:44.413
- Tell me you got something.
- Strip club was a bust, huh?

25:44.586 --> 25:45.961
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:46.129 --> 25:48.880
- That was our last lead.
- What the hell, Bobby.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.336
Don't yell at me, boy.
I'm working my ass off here.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.750
Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm tired.

25:53.927 --> 25:56.632
<i>- Well, who ain't?
What's Bela got?</i>

25:56.805 --> 25:58.513
- What do you got, Bela?
Sorry.

25:58.682 --> 26:02.097
Sometimes the spirit world is in
a chatty mood, and sometimes it isn't.

26:02.268 --> 26:03.679
<i>- She's got nothing.
Great.</i>

26:03.853 --> 26:06.308
Well, I'm just gonna go blow
my brains out now.

26:14.779 --> 26:16.108
Let me ask you something.

26:17.407 --> 26:19.530
What are you doing helping us?

26:20.327 --> 26:22.996
Bobby, I'm surprised
you don't remember.

26:23.872 --> 26:24.903
Flagstaff?

26:27.334 --> 26:28.708
Oh.

26:28.876 --> 26:29.955
Yeah.

26:30.127 --> 26:31.752
Right.

26:33.380 --> 26:35.207
Flagstaff.

26:51.439 --> 26:53.811
All right, that's it. I'm done.

26:54.567 --> 26:57.022
- What are you doing?
- Taking myself a long-overdue nap.

26:57.194 --> 26:59.020
What? Dean,
Jeremy can come after you.

26:59.196 --> 27:00.738
- That's the idea.
- Excuse me?

27:00.906 --> 27:03.397
Come on, we can't find him,
so let him come to me.

27:03.575 --> 27:05.947
On his own turf?
Where he's basically a god?

27:06.119 --> 27:07.150
I can handle it.

27:08.205 --> 27:10.244
- Not alone, you can't.
- Ow!

27:10.956 --> 27:12.949
- What are you doing?
- Coming in with you.

27:13.125 --> 27:14.703
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

27:14.877 --> 27:17.712
At least then it'll be two against one.

27:19.173 --> 27:21.664
- I don't want you digging in my head.
- Too bad.

27:36.731 --> 27:38.391
Dean.

27:38.566 --> 27:40.225
Jeez.

27:41.068 --> 27:43.356
For the love of God.

27:44.988 --> 27:48.606
- What are we still doing here?
- I have no idea.

27:52.496 --> 27:54.487
There's someone out there.

28:19.729 --> 28:21.388
Hey.

28:21.563 --> 28:22.892
You gonna sit down?

28:24.858 --> 28:26.317
Come on.

28:26.485 --> 28:30.068
We only have an hour before
we have to pick Ben up from baseball.

28:34.952 --> 28:37.406
I've never had this dream before.

28:40.873 --> 28:42.949
Stop looking at me like that.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.952
- Sorry.
- Dean.

28:47.839 --> 28:49.711
I love you.

28:58.056 --> 28:59.171
Where'd she go?

29:02.477 --> 29:04.054
Dean.

29:24.747 --> 29:26.491
Okay.

29:42.681 --> 29:43.926
Dean?

30:14.126 --> 30:15.869
Jeremy?

30:32.810 --> 30:34.304
Hey, Dean.

30:43.786 --> 30:45.744
Well, aren't you a handsome
son of a gun.

30:46.623 --> 30:48.449
We need to talk.

30:48.625 --> 30:50.285
I get it. I get it.

30:50.585 --> 30:54.084
I'm my own worst nightmare, that it?
Huh?

30:54.255 --> 30:56.828
<i>Kind of like the Superman llI
junkyard scene?</i>

30:57.007 --> 30:58.715
<i>A little mano y mano with myself?</i>

30:58.884 --> 31:00.876
Joke all you want, smart-ass.

31:02.471 --> 31:05.804
But you can't lie to me.
I know the truth.

31:06.183 --> 31:08.389
I know how dead you are inside.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.801
How worthless you feel.

31:10.978 --> 31:13.552
I know how you look into a mirror...

31:14.607 --> 31:16.149
...and hate what you see.

31:18.778 --> 31:21.399
Sorry, pal, it's not gonna work.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.321
- You're not real.
- Sure I am.

31:25.533 --> 31:27.241
- I'm you.
- I don't think so.

31:28.703 --> 31:30.197
See, this is my siesta.

31:31.247 --> 31:32.576
Not yours.

31:32.749 --> 31:36.367
All I gotta do is snap my fingers
and you go bye-bye.

31:47.596 --> 31:49.672
I'm not going anywhere.

31:49.848 --> 31:51.592
Neither are you.

31:56.103 --> 31:58.013
Like I said...

31:58.606 --> 31:59.637
...we need to talk.

32:03.152 --> 32:04.611
Dean.

32:05.613 --> 32:07.106
Hey.

32:07.364 --> 32:08.858
Wake up.

32:15.914 --> 32:19.164
Boy, you just don't know when to leave
well enough alone, do you?

32:19.334 --> 32:20.912
- You're a psycho.
- You're wrong.

32:21.085 --> 32:23.042
Yeah? Tell that to Dr. Gregg.

32:23.754 --> 32:25.581
The doc? No, no.

32:25.756 --> 32:28.959
The doc's the one that got me hooked
on this stuff and then he took it away.

32:29.885 --> 32:32.506
But I needed it,
and he wouldn't let me have it.

32:32.930 --> 32:34.044
So you killed him?

32:34.431 --> 32:36.637
I can dream again.

32:36.808 --> 32:40.259
You know what that's like,
not to be able to dream?

32:40.645 --> 32:45.105
You never rest, not really.
It's like being awake for 15 years.

32:45.441 --> 32:47.730
And let me guess,
that makes you go crazy?

32:47.902 --> 32:49.479
I just wanna be left alone.

32:50.779 --> 32:52.190
I just wanna dream.

32:52.989 --> 32:55.397
Sorry. Can't do that.

32:55.867 --> 32:57.030
That's the wrong answer.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.709
I'm getting better and better at this.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.333
Stronger and stronger all the time.

33:17.179 --> 33:18.553
But you and your brother...

33:19.180 --> 33:21.089
...you're not waking up.

33:21.849 --> 33:23.641
Not this time.

33:23.810 --> 33:25.138
I'm not gonna let you.

33:25.311 --> 33:28.645
I mean, you're going to hell
and you won't lift a finger to stop it?

33:28.815 --> 33:31.057
Talk about low self-esteem.

33:31.234 --> 33:33.724
Then again,
it's not much of a life worth saving.

33:33.902 --> 33:35.231
Wake up, Dean. Wake up.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.811
After all, you've got nothing,
outside of Sam.

33:39.241 --> 33:40.320
You are nothing.

33:41.827 --> 33:44.318
You're as mindless and obedient
as an attack dog.

33:44.496 --> 33:45.954
- That's not true.
- No?

33:47.873 --> 33:49.700
What are the things that you want?

33:49.875 --> 33:51.951
What are the things that you dream?

33:52.545 --> 33:55.000
I mean, your car, that's Dad's.

33:55.172 --> 33:58.672
Your favorite leather jacket, Dad's.
Your music, Dad's.

33:58.843 --> 34:01.380
Do you even have an original thought?

34:02.429 --> 34:05.180
No. No, all there is is,
"Watch out for Sammy.

34:05.348 --> 34:07.756
Look after your little brother, boy!"

34:08.893 --> 34:11.764
You can still hear your Dad's voice
in your head, can't you?

34:12.230 --> 34:14.304
- Clear as a bell.
- Just shut up.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.476
When you think about it...

34:18.652 --> 34:23.279
...all he ever did was train you,
boss you around.

34:23.449 --> 34:24.480
But Sam...

34:25.367 --> 34:26.909
Sam, he doted on.

34:27.744 --> 34:29.735
- Sam, he loved.
- I mean it.

34:29.911 --> 34:32.830
- I'm getting angry.
- Dad knew who you really were.

34:33.541 --> 34:35.165
A good soldier and nothing else.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.250
Daddy's blunt little instrument.

34:39.672 --> 34:42.161
Your father didn't care
whether you lived or died.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.748
- Why should you?
- Son of a bitch!

34:45.844 --> 34:47.835
My father was an obsessed bastard!

34:51.933 --> 34:55.467
All that crap he dumped on me,
about protecting Sam, that was his crap.

34:55.645 --> 34:58.681
He's the one
who couldn't protect his family.

34:59.523 --> 35:01.563
He's the one who let Mom die.

35:01.734 --> 35:04.984
Who wasn't there for Sam.
I always was. He wasn't fair!

35:05.154 --> 35:09.234
I didn't deserve what he put on me.
And I don't deserve to go to hell!

35:36.058 --> 35:37.931
You can't escape me, Dean.

35:38.101 --> 35:39.263
You're gonna die.

35:39.435 --> 35:42.104
And this,
this is what you're gonna become.

35:43.272 --> 35:45.015
You can't stop me.

35:45.941 --> 35:47.815
There's nothing I can't do in here.

35:48.194 --> 35:50.400
- Because of the Dream Root.
- That's right.

35:50.571 --> 35:53.773
Yeah?
Well, you're forgetting something.

35:53.948 --> 35:55.490
What's that?

35:57.827 --> 36:00.152
I took the Dream Root too.

36:00.580 --> 36:01.991
Jeremy!

36:02.373 --> 36:03.618
Jeremy!

36:05.251 --> 36:06.330
No.

36:06.835 --> 36:08.543
No.

36:08.921 --> 36:11.328
- Dad?
- Answer me when I'm talking to you.

36:12.090 --> 36:13.750
No.

36:42.427 --> 36:46.010
So you did a little dream-weaving
of your own in there, huh?

36:46.181 --> 36:49.762
Yeah. I just sort of concentrated
and it happened, you know?

36:49.933 --> 36:52.259
Didn't have anything to do with...

36:52.561 --> 36:55.562
...you know, your psychic stuff?

36:59.026 --> 37:00.603
No.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.943
I mean, I don't think so.

37:04.572 --> 37:07.027
Good. Good.

37:13.998 --> 37:17.413
You guys seen Bela? She's not in
her room, not answering her phone.

37:18.627 --> 37:21.996
- She must've taken off or something.
- Just like that? A little weird.

37:22.172 --> 37:24.923
What's weird is why she helped us
in the first place.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.543
I thought you saved her life.

37:27.719 --> 37:29.925
What the hell are you talking about?

37:30.096 --> 37:31.637
That thing at Flagstaff?

37:32.973 --> 37:37.185
That thing at Flagstaff was an amulet.
I gave her a good deal, that's all.

37:40.439 --> 37:41.719
Well, then why did...?

37:41.899 --> 37:43.975
You boys better check your pockets.

37:45.610 --> 37:47.899
Not literally.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.280
No, no, no.

37:55.453 --> 37:57.446
The Colt.

37:57.872 --> 37:59.413
Bela stole the Colt.

37:59.581 --> 38:01.206
Damn it, boys.

38:01.374 --> 38:02.999
Pack your crap.

38:03.168 --> 38:04.579
Why? Where we going?

38:04.753 --> 38:06.959
We're gonna go hunt the bitch down.

38:10.467 --> 38:12.673
Hey, Sam, I was wondering.

38:12.844 --> 38:14.670
When you were in my head,
what did you see?

38:14.845 --> 38:17.597
Uh, just Jeremy.
He kept me separated from you.

38:18.224 --> 38:20.762
Easier to beat my brains out that way,
I guess.

38:21.393 --> 38:23.682
What about you? You never said.

38:23.854 --> 38:26.392
Nothing. I was looking for you
the whole time.

38:35.156 --> 38:37.777
- Sam.
- Yeah?

38:38.284 --> 38:41.036
Ahem. I've been doing some thinking.

38:41.287 --> 38:43.030
And...

38:44.581 --> 38:46.657
Well, the thing is...

38:48.877 --> 38:50.419
...I don't wanna die.

38:54.549 --> 38:56.458
I don't wanna go to hell.

39:01.389 --> 39:03.381
All right. Yeah.

39:03.933 --> 39:06.175
We'll find a way to save you.

39:09.063 --> 39:10.770
Okay, good.

39:13.024 --> 39:16.523
<i>You can't escape me,
Dean. You're gonna die.</i>

39:16.695 --> 39:19.232
And this?
This is what you're gonna become.
