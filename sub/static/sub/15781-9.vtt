you Sphinx guys sure
aren't very discreet.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.733
Huh? Ah.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.701
Sorry to disappoint you
fellas,

17:16.769 --> 17:19.295
but you ain't gonna be doing
any arching tonight.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.566

you might call

17:20.638 --> 17:23.074
a, uh, medical emergency
on our hands here

17:23.142 --> 17:26.476
and, well, the Monarch knows
it's against Guild rules.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.537
Yeah, that might
be a problem.

17:28.614 --> 17:29.877
Well, I should say so --

17:29.948 --> 17:31.849
If we worked
for the Monarch.

17:31.917 --> 17:35.445
You see, we're what you might
call "on strike,"

17:35.521 --> 17:37.490

no Guild.
