00:18.947 --> 00:21.115
Four days till Halloween.

00:21.116 --> 00:24.067
So five days till I'm feeling
dandy and pooping candy.

00:24.068 --> 00:25.986
I don't know what
my costume's gonna be,

00:25.987 --> 00:29.072
but I do know it'll be last
minute and Mom will make it.

00:29.073 --> 00:30.958
I think I have a pretty
great idea for a costume.

00:30.959 --> 00:32.241
(singsongy):
Maybe even great enough

00:32.243 --> 00:33.910
to win the costume contest.

00:33.995 --> 00:35.746
Oh, yeah, the costume contest.

00:35.747 --> 00:38.414
I'm disqualified
because of last year.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.468
And next we have Louise
Belcher dressed as,

00:41.469 --> 00:43.303
ah, Phillip Frond.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.339
(imitating Mr. Frond):
I'm a guidance counselor.

00:45.340 --> 00:47.557
Council, council, council, council.
‭No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:47.592 --> 00:49.143
Safe to cross.

00:49.144 --> 00:50.844
I don't do
costume contests.

00:50.845 --> 00:52.479
The only contests
I do start with

00:52.480 --> 00:54.097
either "Miss"
or "Pie Eating."

00:54.098 --> 00:55.566
I'm gonna be a hot mess.

00:55.567 --> 00:56.900
I'm gonna dress really messy

00:56.901 --> 00:58.318
and then decorate myself
in flames.

00:58.319 --> 01:00.437
Ooh, Tina,
that's a good idea.

01:00.438 --> 01:03.190
Yeah. Wait, you're
gonna be a hot mess?

01:03.191 --> 01:05.409
Because I'm actually
gonna be a hot mess.

01:05.410 --> 01:08.162
Wait, I thought we were
gonna be sexy Judge Judys?

01:08.163 --> 01:10.697
No, Jocelyn,
I'm gonna be a hot mess.

01:10.698 --> 01:12.032
Tammy, are you saying
that because you just

01:12.033 --> 01:13.450
heard me say it
and like the idea?

01:13.451 --> 01:15.701
No, I like the idea
because it's mine now.

01:15.787 --> 01:17.788
I mean, it was always mine.
Always. I always had it.

01:17.789 --> 01:19.173
She's got you there, T.

01:19.174 --> 01:20.674
Back on the sidewalk.

01:20.675 --> 01:22.459
Wait, Tammy!
‭See ya later!

01:22.460 --> 01:23.709
I'm gonna sign up for the
costume contest right now.

01:23.795 --> 01:26.012
My hot mess idea
is totally gonna win.

01:26.097 --> 01:27.798
It's my idea!

01:27.799 --> 01:29.349
I need to cross the street.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.434
Not safe.

01:30.435 --> 01:31.969
Jackie, please, let me cross!

01:31.970 --> 01:33.470
Tammy's stealing
my costume idea!

01:33.471 --> 01:35.022
Not safe.

01:35.023 --> 01:36.640
But there are
no cars coming, look!

01:36.641 --> 01:38.308
Now I'm not
letting you cross

01:38.309 --> 01:39.693
because you're
getting on my nerves.

01:39.694 --> 01:41.144
(groans)

01:41.145 --> 01:43.063
Thanks a lot, Jackie.
Thank you.

01:43.064 --> 01:45.449
I can see two things
coming from a mile away:

01:45.450 --> 01:46.817
cars and sarcasm.

01:46.818 --> 01:48.061
Crossing guard burn.

01:49.654 --> 01:51.153
All right, guys.

01:51.206 --> 01:52.955
Here it is.
‭Wow.

01:52.991 --> 01:55.459
Ooh, I love it!
My little Bobbleangelo.

01:55.460 --> 01:56.993
It's a perfect burger.

01:57.078 --> 01:59.129
Yeah. I used a stencil.

01:59.130 --> 02:01.163
Oh. ‭Okay.
Slightly less impressed.

02:01.249 --> 02:03.166
It's clever though, right?
We're a burger restaurant.

02:03.167 --> 02:04.500
It's advertising.

02:04.552 --> 02:05.919
I wouldn't
say "clever."

02:05.920 --> 02:08.005
I'm gonna go put this outside.
‭Outside?

02:08.006 --> 02:10.256
Why don't you put it
on the counter for decoration?

02:10.341 --> 02:12.175
No, jack-o'-lanterns go outside.

02:12.176 --> 02:14.811
That's what people do
with jack-o'-lanterns.

02:14.812 --> 02:17.848
But what if some kid smashes it
or eggs it or something?

02:17.849 --> 02:19.850
I'll bring it in tonight,
when we close up.

02:19.851 --> 02:23.487
When I was a kid, squirrels used
to eat our jack-o'-lanterns. Aw.

02:23.488 --> 02:25.989
And then one year my dad sat
in the bushes with a BB gun

02:25.990 --> 02:27.741
and he waited
for the squirrels to come.

02:27.742 --> 02:30.027
Oh. ‭Huh.
‭Eh. Well, it wasn't BBs that got 'em.

02:30.028 --> 02:31.695
He also poisoned
the pumpkins.

02:31.696 --> 02:34.363
That was, uh,
not my favorite Halloween.

02:34.449 --> 02:35.831
(Tina groaning)

02:35.867 --> 02:38.368
I can't believe
Tammy stole my costume.

02:38.369 --> 02:40.369
I can't believe
that you can't believe it.

02:40.455 --> 02:42.205
I really wanted
to win this year.

02:42.206 --> 02:43.957
(sighs) I've come so close
so many times.

02:43.958 --> 02:45.509
I can taste it.

02:45.510 --> 02:46.759
FROND:
And the winner is...

02:46.844 --> 02:48.545
Katie Waxman!

02:48.546 --> 02:50.047
Aw.

02:50.048 --> 02:51.882
And the winner is...

02:51.883 --> 02:54.184
Nicholas Mendoza!

02:54.185 --> 02:55.185
(sighs)

02:55.186 --> 02:56.970
And the winner is...

02:56.971 --> 02:58.522
Tina Belch...
‭(gasps)

02:58.523 --> 03:00.774
Oh, wait, sorry.
Trina Belson!

03:00.775 --> 03:01.891
(groans)

03:01.976 --> 03:03.894
(sighs)
Now what am I gonna be?

03:03.895 --> 03:05.479
You could go as a
sore loser again.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.281
You're great at
that costume.

03:07.282 --> 03:10.033
Okay, you guys, what about...
what about, what about...

03:10.034 --> 03:11.734
what about a sand-witch?

03:11.786 --> 03:14.454
I've got fish sticks,
but I'm open to the possibility.

03:14.455 --> 03:17.207
No, no, I mean a sand-witch...
two pieces of bread

03:17.208 --> 03:18.992
with a witch in the middle.
Eh. ‭Eh.

03:18.993 --> 03:20.911
I'm gonna go to the library
to research witches and bread.

03:20.912 --> 03:24.164
Oh, sure, yeah, just check out
that book Witches and Bread.

03:24.165 --> 03:25.749
And then check out
Vampires and Cake.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.167
It's a classic.

03:27.168 --> 03:29.086
TINA:
Hi, Mr. Ambrose.

03:29.087 --> 03:30.837
I'm looking for books on witches.
‭Witches?

03:30.838 --> 03:33.090
Yeah. I need to find
some good pictures.

03:33.091 --> 03:35.808
I'm gonna be a sand-witch
for Halloween. Get it?

03:35.893 --> 03:37.311
Yeah. I get it, yeah.

03:37.312 --> 03:38.812
I mean, I know witches
wear pointy hats

03:38.813 --> 03:40.347
and fly on broomsticks,
but it'd be helpful

03:40.348 --> 03:42.265
to have a reference
picture to work off of.

03:42.266 --> 03:43.933
I really want to win
the costume contest.

03:44.018 --> 03:46.436
Witches don't wear pointy hats
and fly on broomsticks.

03:46.437 --> 03:48.188
They look like everyone else.

03:48.189 --> 03:50.240
They do? Yeah,
you're describing a stereotype.

03:50.241 --> 03:51.407
Don't be a witchist.

03:51.442 --> 03:52.943
I-I'm not! I didn't know.

03:52.944 --> 03:54.611
I-I mean...
What-what do you mean?

03:54.612 --> 03:57.279
Witches are powerful
and alluring.

03:57.365 --> 03:59.199
Wow. I like
powerful and alluring.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.167
How do you know so much
about witches, Mr. Ambrose?

04:01.252 --> 04:03.420
Duh! I work in a library!

04:03.421 --> 04:05.589
Oh. Right.
‭(whispering): And I am one!

04:05.590 --> 04:07.257
What?
‭I am one!

04:07.258 --> 04:08.958
Shh!
‭Really?

04:09.010 --> 04:10.677
Don't look so surprised.

04:10.678 --> 04:12.345
Listen, do you really want
to win this contest?

04:12.430 --> 04:14.264
Yes.
Then be a witch.

04:14.265 --> 04:16.798
I think I made it pretty clear
I'm going to be a witch.

04:16.884 --> 04:18.969
No, I mean be a witch.

04:18.970 --> 04:21.721
Then you can cast a spell
to win the contest.

04:21.723 --> 04:24.024
There's such a thing as a spell
to win a costume contest?

04:24.025 --> 04:25.809
Of course there is.
You think people just win

04:25.810 --> 04:27.277
the Nobel Peace Prize?

04:27.278 --> 04:28.778
I mean, I thought
they did.

04:28.813 --> 04:31.313
Wake up, Tina!
Witches are everywhere.

04:31.366 --> 04:33.066
Oh.
‭Here. You can try a spell.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.401
It might work,
it might not.

04:34.402 --> 04:36.319
Not everyone
is able to do it.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.655
Huh. Okay, well,
I guess I'll give it a try.

04:38.656 --> 04:40.489
But, Tina, beware.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.958
Casting spells
can be really dangerous.

04:42.994 --> 04:44.243
Oh, wait, should I not...

04:44.328 --> 04:46.163
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
you totally should.

04:46.164 --> 04:47.831
But I'm just saying...
(whispers): beware!

04:47.832 --> 04:50.167
Okay. Um, do I go now?

04:50.168 --> 04:51.550
Yeah, you go.

04:51.636 --> 04:52.886
TINA:
My first spell.

04:52.887 --> 04:55.304
Here I go into the dark arts.

04:55.339 --> 04:57.674
"First, carve the word 'contest'
into a candle."

04:57.675 --> 04:59.392
Okay, did that.

04:59.477 --> 05:02.312
"Then light the candle
and say the following words:

05:02.313 --> 05:04.681
"'I make this true
by closing my eyes

05:04.682 --> 05:06.483
and see myself winning
first prize.'"

05:06.484 --> 05:07.984
Tina!
‭Aah!

05:07.985 --> 05:09.735
We thought of another
costume idea for you.

05:09.821 --> 05:12.522
Cheer-bacca. It's Chewbacca
in a cheerleading uniform.

05:12.523 --> 05:14.524
What's, uh,
happening in here?

05:14.525 --> 05:16.410
You trying to cover up
your room funk?

05:16.411 --> 05:18.412
(sniffs) Whew,
'cause it's not working.

05:18.413 --> 05:20.363
Wait, is that
a spell book?

05:20.364 --> 05:22.416
Mr. Ambrose gave me this book.
He's a witch.

05:22.417 --> 05:24.034
Seriously?
Ambrose? Huh.

05:24.035 --> 05:26.036
Well, he does ride
to school on a bike

05:26.037 --> 05:27.838
with a little dog
in the front basket.

05:27.839 --> 05:30.090
Yeah. So, I'm kinda

05:30.091 --> 05:32.375
learning how to be a witch, too.
‭What?! ‭What?!

05:32.376 --> 05:34.878
And I just cast a spell
to win the costume contest.

05:34.879 --> 05:37.596
What a fun way to cheat
at a costume contest.

05:37.682 --> 05:39.966
Well, after Tammy stole my idea,
which was unfair,

05:39.967 --> 05:41.551
I decided it was okay
to be unfair.

05:41.552 --> 05:43.687
I could use a spell.
Anything in there to get me

05:43.688 --> 05:45.388
out of my book report tomorrow?
Huh.

05:45.389 --> 05:47.274
Oh, there's a spell here
that could work for you.

05:47.275 --> 05:49.693
Cast it. Cast away.
‭Don't bring up that movie!

05:49.694 --> 05:51.560

No, I just realized I forgot to
take my jack-o'-lantern inside.

lunch at school.

today's lunch?

Nothing, nothing.

Shocking. I just need
something of Jimmy Jr.'s.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.194
Maybe his old, um, gym sock?

06:41.195 --> 06:43.413
You have a drawer
of Jimmy Jr.'s things?

06:43.414 --> 06:45.332

wet marshmallows?

06:48.669 --> 06:51.121
From his hot chocolate.

06:51.122 --> 06:53.206
Jimmy Jr., Jimmy Jr.,
Jimmy Jr.

06:53.207 --> 06:55.175
Okay. Done.
Give me one of those marshmallows.

06:55.176 --> 06:57.594

where I put it in my mouth.

Tina, look!

07:14.695 --> 07:16.363
Is that a fish stick?

07:16.364 --> 07:19.032
Yes! Spell fulfilled.
I found it in my locker.

07:19.033 --> 07:21.067
I was using it
as a bookmark.

07:21.068 --> 07:23.369
That's not all.
Guess who got jury duty.

07:23.454 --> 07:24.654
Who? Dish.

to do my book report!

07:28.292 --> 07:30.243
Wow. So those spells
actually worked.

07:30.244 --> 07:32.462
But what about my love spell?
Hey, Tina.

07:32.463 --> 07:34.130
Hey, Jimmy Jr., Zeke.

07:34.131 --> 07:36.666

Where are you gonna sit?

07:36.667 --> 07:38.752
I don't know.
Can we sit here? ‭Sure.

07:38.753 --> 07:40.720
Move over, Rover!
Come on! ‭Ow.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.172
Son of a witch. (Jimmy Jr.
and Zeke arguing)

07:42.173 --> 07:43.807
The spells worked!

07:43.808 --> 07:45.140
(quietly):
I guess I'm a real witch.

07:45.176 --> 07:47.861
We'd better get you registered
for some cauldrons.

07:47.862 --> 07:49.464
Get Crate and Barrel
on the phone.

07:51.066 --> 07:51.898
(Bob snoring)

07:51.984 --> 07:53.901
(sniffs) Bob?

07:53.902 --> 07:56.604
Do you smell that?
Something's burning.

07:56.605 --> 07:59.322
Okay, you keep sleeping.
I'll go save our lives.

07:59.358 --> 08:01.691
Normal.

08:01.743 --> 08:03.526
Normal.

08:03.579 --> 08:05.663
Normal... What?!

08:05.664 --> 08:08.032
Tina, what the hell
is going on?!

08:08.033 --> 08:10.334
(groans)
Mom. It's hard to explain.

08:10.335 --> 08:12.620
You wouldn't get it.
I get that it's late

08:12.621 --> 08:14.255
and you're gonna
burn the house down.

08:14.256 --> 08:16.456
It's like Kenny G's
rehearsal space in here.

08:16.541 --> 08:18.009
(blowing)

08:18.010 --> 08:19.460
Linda Belcher, not a peep.

08:19.461 --> 08:21.128
Close your eyes
and go to sleep.

08:21.129 --> 08:23.713
I am going to sleep.
All right.

08:23.765 --> 08:26.467
Good night.
No more candles.

08:26.468 --> 08:29.170
Don't call me Linda Belcher.
It's creepy.

08:29.221 --> 08:31.054
(rock intro playing)

08:33.392 --> 08:34.859
♪ Ha-ha, ha, ha, ha... ♪

08:34.860 --> 08:37.693
Ow! Tina!
What the hell?

08:37.729 --> 08:39.981
Darryl, I hear you're gonna be
E.T. for Halloween.

08:39.982 --> 08:41.782
You might want
to phone home to me

08:41.783 --> 08:43.317
to congratulate
me on winning.

08:43.318 --> 08:46.153
Hey, Peter, your costume
is gonna be the Mona Lisa?

08:46.154 --> 08:47.905
Yeah.
‭Well, you might want to...

08:47.906 --> 08:50.291
Mone home... after
I win the contest.

08:50.292 --> 08:51.492
What?

08:51.493 --> 08:53.077
Jimmy Jr., want to walk my ass
to class?

08:53.078 --> 08:54.829
Uh... okay.

08:54.830 --> 08:57.498
Someone woke up
all witchy today.

08:57.499 --> 08:59.583
What do you got there,
a second jack-o'-lantern?

08:59.584 --> 09:01.252
Actually, it's my third.

09:01.253 --> 09:03.671
The first one was my fault;
I forgot to bring it in.

09:03.672 --> 09:05.256
But the second one,
when I put it out...

09:05.257 --> 09:08.259
I'll tell it, I'll tell it!
It's a mystery.

09:08.260 --> 09:10.928
Bob was locking up the
restaurant when he remembered

09:10.929 --> 09:12.930
the jack-o'-lantern
was still sitting there.

09:12.931 --> 09:15.099
He looked away for a second
to unlock the door,

09:15.100 --> 09:16.734
and when he turned back,

09:16.735 --> 09:19.602
the jack-o'-lantern
had vanished!

09:19.688 --> 09:24.608
And then he went, "No...!"

09:24.609 --> 09:27.912
I-I didn't scream,
"No..." I said, "No."

09:27.913 --> 09:30.164
Actually, I don't even
think I said, "No."

09:30.165 --> 09:32.666
I think I said something
cool, like a swear.

09:32.751 --> 09:35.786
So the pumpkin just disappeared?
Oh, spooky.

09:35.787 --> 09:38.839
Well, I mean, someone took it
and was very good at doing that.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.542
Or something.
Like a ghost.

09:41.543 --> 09:43.010
(gasps)
‭It wasn't a ghost.

09:43.011 --> 09:44.962
I'm staying away
from that pumpkin just in case.

09:44.963 --> 09:46.596
Okay. Done.

09:46.631 --> 09:47.631
I'm putting it outside.

09:47.632 --> 09:49.550
Outside? Are you nuts?

09:49.551 --> 09:50.968
Leave it in here
where it's safe.

09:50.969 --> 09:52.770
No, no, no, no, Lin,
I want someone

09:52.771 --> 09:54.271
to try and take this one.

09:54.272 --> 09:55.973
And I'm gonna catch them
when they do.

09:55.974 --> 09:57.641
This pumpkin is bait.

09:57.642 --> 09:59.143
Bait for a ghost.
Pumpkin Ghost,

09:59.144 --> 10:01.479
I want it on record,
I have nothing to do with this!

10:01.480 --> 10:02.897
Me neither!
It's just Bob!

10:02.898 --> 10:05.032
Get him! Don't get us!
Sorry, Bob.

10:05.033 --> 10:07.485
I cast all the spells
in this book.

10:07.486 --> 10:08.786
Can I get a new one?

10:08.787 --> 10:10.121
You cast all the spells?
‭Yeah.

10:10.122 --> 10:12.156
It's a reference book.

10:12.157 --> 10:14.658
You're not supposed to run
through it like an Us Weekly!

10:14.659 --> 10:16.827
Well, I did. I think I'm good
at this witch thing.

10:16.828 --> 10:18.879
Ugh. You've been a witch
for, what, two days?

10:18.880 --> 10:20.381
Take it down a notch!

10:20.382 --> 10:21.665
You're playing
with powerful forces!

10:21.666 --> 10:22.967
This is not kids' stuff!

10:22.968 --> 10:24.418
I am powerful forces.

10:24.419 --> 10:25.585
Witch, please!

10:25.670 --> 10:26.837
Fine. I don't need your books.

10:26.838 --> 10:27.922
I'll just go on the Internet.

10:27.923 --> 10:29.055
Because print is dead.

10:29.141 --> 10:30.508
Tell me about it.

10:30.509 --> 10:31.642
Can you log me
into the computer?

10:31.643 --> 10:32.843
Yeah, sure, yeah.

10:32.844 --> 10:35.563
TINA: (groans)
This is taking forever.

10:35.564 --> 10:37.481
It's the last phase
of a waning moon.

10:37.482 --> 10:39.100
We're wasting good
spell-casting time.

10:39.101 --> 10:41.352
I'm beginning to understand
why they burned witches.

10:41.353 --> 10:44.687
Yeah, T, you don't have to be
such a spell hound.

10:44.773 --> 10:46.023
Okay to cross.

10:46.024 --> 10:47.241
Finally. I thought
this was a crosswalk,

10:47.242 --> 10:48.576
not a "wait around
all day" walk.

10:48.577 --> 10:49.576
Excuse me?

10:49.661 --> 10:50.744
You heard me.

10:50.829 --> 10:52.496
You watch your mouth.

10:52.497 --> 10:54.414
You watch my mouth...
cast a spell on you.

10:54.499 --> 10:56.082
Excuse me?

10:56.168 --> 10:57.535
Didn't we just do this?

10:57.536 --> 10:59.620
You're gonna cast
a spell on me?

10:59.621 --> 11:00.704
I could.

11:00.705 --> 11:01.872
Really?
‭Really.

11:01.873 --> 11:03.124
Hey! What are you doing?

11:03.125 --> 11:04.375
My barrette.
Give it back.

11:04.376 --> 11:06.593
Can't. I need it for my spell.

11:06.678 --> 11:07.878
Your spell?

11:07.879 --> 11:11.047
In 24 hours,
your fate will be worse,

11:11.099 --> 11:14.935
'cause the girl who cast spells
now is cursed!

11:14.936 --> 11:15.886
You can keep
crossing now.

11:15.887 --> 11:17.021
Wait, but...

11:17.022 --> 11:18.722
Cross!
(screams)

11:18.723 --> 11:19.723
Oh, my God.

11:19.724 --> 11:21.142
Did you just get cursed?

11:21.143 --> 11:22.226
I think so?

11:22.227 --> 11:23.310
Look on the bright side:

11:23.311 --> 11:25.388
your hair looks great like that.

11:27.330 --> 11:28.947
Tina, you okay?

11:28.948 --> 11:30.616
You're just pushing
around your meatballs.

11:30.617 --> 11:32.201
Are you eating dinner
or playing pool?

11:32.202 --> 11:33.419
(chuckles)
‭Yeah...

11:33.420 --> 11:34.920
I'm just
kind of distracted

11:34.921 --> 11:36.872
thinking about this thing
someone said to me today.

11:36.873 --> 11:38.374
Wha? What thing?

11:38.375 --> 11:39.958
It's about being cursed
and my fate.

11:39.959 --> 11:41.510
You know, that kind of thing.

11:41.511 --> 11:44.213
Sheesh, school bullies have
gotten so much more poetic.

11:44.214 --> 11:45.931
Back in my day,
you just got called

11:45.932 --> 11:47.966
"poop-stain-pinkpants"
or something.

11:47.967 --> 11:49.968
They would just say it
over and over again.

11:49.969 --> 11:51.437
(screams)
Did you guys see that?

11:51.438 --> 11:52.603
The knife almost
stabbed my foot!

11:52.689 --> 11:54.139
You could've lost a toe.

11:54.140 --> 11:56.442
But maybe that little weird one.
That would've been fine.

11:56.443 --> 11:58.060
BOB: Hey, Lin?
Can you bring me the salt?

11:58.061 --> 11:59.310
Come get it yourself!

11:59.396 --> 12:01.530
You know I can't leave my post.

12:01.531 --> 12:03.732
LINDA: Bob, Tina got
cursed today!

12:03.733 --> 12:05.534
Oh. Sorry, Tina!

12:05.535 --> 12:07.369
Would it help if you
brought me the salt?

12:07.370 --> 12:08.787
Just come get it, Bob!

12:08.788 --> 12:10.539
Fine!

12:10.540 --> 12:11.957
Quick, quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick, quick,

12:11.958 --> 12:13.325
quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick...

12:13.326 --> 12:14.877
I've never seen Dad
move that fast

12:14.878 --> 12:16.161
when it wasn't bathroom related.

12:16.162 --> 12:17.161
(Bob screams)

12:17.247 --> 12:18.914
It's gone!

12:18.915 --> 12:20.382
LINDA:
What? Really?

12:20.383 --> 12:22.584
You made me come
get the salt!

12:22.585 --> 12:24.136
Wait a minute.

12:24.137 --> 12:25.921
Pesto.

12:25.922 --> 12:27.506
Jimmy Pesto didn't
steal your pumpkin, Bob.

12:27.507 --> 12:29.758
He's bussing a table.
Oh, he did it.

12:29.759 --> 12:31.643
I don't know how he did it,
but he did it.

12:31.644 --> 12:33.679
I'm watching you, Jimmy!

12:33.680 --> 12:36.148
I'm watching you!
Oh, yeah?

12:36.149 --> 12:37.232
Watch this.

12:37.233 --> 12:39.434
(farts)
Zoom! Ha!

12:39.519 --> 12:42.020
No, Jimmy, no, not zoom!

12:42.021 --> 12:43.989
I do... don't go inside!

12:43.990 --> 12:45.774
(muffled):
I cannot hear you!

12:45.775 --> 12:46.941
Ha, ha, ha!

12:47.026 --> 12:48.409
Oh, my God!

12:48.445 --> 12:50.361
(wind whistling softly)

12:50.447 --> 12:52.163
Huh.

12:52.248 --> 12:54.352
Why is my window open?

12:57.036 --> 12:58.002
(gasps)

12:58.087 --> 12:59.921
(chuckles nervously)

12:59.956 --> 13:01.757
That was weird.

13:01.758 --> 13:03.007
JACKIE (whispering):
The girl who cast spells

13:03.092 --> 13:04.625
now is cursed!

13:04.677 --> 13:06.128
(screams)

13:06.129 --> 13:08.212
(cackling)

13:08.298 --> 13:12.996
(screaming)

13:18.358 --> 13:20.476
You know what?
I'm gonna cross down there.

13:20.477 --> 13:22.311
Does it have to do with
the woman who cursed you

13:22.312 --> 13:23.695
waving you into the street?

13:23.696 --> 13:26.031
Is it just so you can
get your steps in today?

13:26.032 --> 13:28.233
Yeah... I'll catch up
with you guys later.

13:28.234 --> 13:31.153
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

13:31.154 --> 13:32.571
(screams) BIKER:
Bike lane, ma'am!

13:32.572 --> 13:34.039
Sorry! Cursed!

13:34.040 --> 13:35.824
And I'm only 13;
please don't call me "ma'am."

13:35.825 --> 13:36.792
Mr. Ambrose?

13:36.793 --> 13:38.042
Yes, Goth Brooks?

13:38.127 --> 13:39.661
I think I got cursed...

13:39.662 --> 13:40.546
Yawn.

13:40.547 --> 13:42.047
...by Jackie the crossing guard.

13:42.048 --> 13:45.167
Did you say
"Jackie the crossing guard"?

13:45.168 --> 13:47.152
Yeah. ‭Oh, if that's true,
you're in trouble.

13:47.153 --> 13:49.171
Jackie's a witch.
A mean witch.

13:49.172 --> 13:51.273
God! How many witches are
there at this school?!

13:51.274 --> 13:52.708
I told you,
witches are everywhere!

13:52.709 --> 13:54.009
I thought you were just
being dramatic!

13:54.010 --> 13:55.811
I was! But it's also true!

13:55.812 --> 13:57.012
Then it's not just
being dramatic!

13:57.013 --> 13:58.514
I did both!

13:58.515 --> 13:59.982
Jackie and I used to be
in the same coven.

13:59.983 --> 14:01.400
She's a powerful witch.

14:01.401 --> 14:03.151
But she always wanted
to go dark.

14:03.152 --> 14:05.153
Revenge spells this.
Curse your enemies that.

14:05.154 --> 14:07.356
And she never
chipped in for pizza.

14:07.357 --> 14:09.608
Whoa.
Tell me exactly what she said.

14:09.609 --> 14:11.076
First, she took
my barrette.

14:11.077 --> 14:12.076
Oh, God.
What?

14:12.161 --> 14:13.077
Oh, forget it. Keep going.

14:13.162 --> 14:15.163
Um... And then she said,

14:15.164 --> 14:16.949
"In 24 hours,
your fate will be worse,

14:16.950 --> 14:19.034
'cause the girl
who cast spells now is cursed."

14:19.035 --> 14:20.668
Okay. So yeah. You're cursed.

14:20.703 --> 14:21.753
Oh, no!

14:21.754 --> 14:23.038
(both scream)

14:23.039 --> 14:24.623
Hey, do you think
there's any way

14:24.624 --> 14:26.758
I could get you to leave
the library? ‭What?

14:26.759 --> 14:28.427
I don't want to die
in some freak accident

14:28.428 --> 14:30.512
just because I'm next to you.
So get out!

14:30.513 --> 14:31.547
Out!
‭(screams)

14:31.548 --> 14:32.742
Best of luck!

14:37.387 --> 14:39.271
I know. I know
what you're doing.

14:39.272 --> 14:40.973
Oh, yeah? Well, I know
what you're doing.

14:40.974 --> 14:42.891
You're stinking up
my sidewalk.

14:42.892 --> 14:44.276
(laughs) ‭Ha! 'Cause he stinks.

14:44.277 --> 14:45.644
Yeah, that's right, Trev.

14:45.645 --> 14:48.230
No. I know about
the pumpkins, Jimmy.

14:48.231 --> 14:52.034
You've been sneaking over
on your kitty cat paws

14:52.035 --> 14:54.319
in the dark to my place.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.288
Eh... okay.

14:56.289 --> 14:58.073
Wow. Finally
snapped, huh, Bob?

14:58.074 --> 15:00.576
Pumpkinhead's lost his gourd.
(laughs)

15:00.577 --> 15:02.411
Whoa. Mental illness.
No joke.

15:02.412 --> 15:04.246
No, don't say "mental illness."

15:04.247 --> 15:05.831
Come on, you're ruining it.
Just...

15:05.832 --> 15:06.915
Not a joke.

15:06.916 --> 15:08.194
Listen, just go inside,
would ya?

15:08.217 --> 15:09.501
It's a disease.
(stammers)

15:09.502 --> 15:11.336
Would you go inside?
I'm talking to Bob.

15:11.337 --> 15:14.256
Jimmy, you steal this one,
I'm gonna call the police.

15:14.257 --> 15:17.643
And they will come, immediately,

15:17.644 --> 15:20.061
because this is serious.

15:20.096 --> 15:21.597
Zoom.

15:21.598 --> 15:23.899
Hey, hey. Don't say
"zoom." That's mine.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.182
Zoom, Jimmy.

15:25.268 --> 15:26.268
Hey...

15:26.269 --> 15:29.154
Zoom, Jimmy!

15:29.155 --> 15:30.656
On your right, ma'am.
Ooh! Sorry.

15:30.657 --> 15:32.051
I'm not a ma'am.
Close enough!

15:33.776 --> 15:35.888
(indistinct chatter)

15:37.566 --> 15:39.698
TAMMY: Tina, you have to
admit that I look better

15:39.699 --> 15:42.367
as a hot mess than you would
have... if it had been your idea.

15:42.368 --> 15:43.785
Tammy, it doesn't matter
because I'm gonna win

15:43.786 --> 15:45.287
the contest... that much I know.

15:45.288 --> 15:47.122
I just hope I don't die first.

15:47.123 --> 15:48.957
What? ‭What are
you talking about?

15:48.958 --> 15:50.958
I don't speak bread.
‭Yeah.

15:51.044 --> 15:52.961
Tina, we came back
to say break a leg.

15:52.962 --> 15:55.180
But not really. I know
you're worried about that.

15:55.181 --> 15:57.633
What if the curse happens now,
during the contest?

15:57.634 --> 15:58.967
Tina, nothing's
gonna happen.

15:58.968 --> 16:00.636
Just wiggle your nose
or something

16:00.637 --> 16:01.852
and un-curse yourself.

16:03.272 --> 16:04.605
(both screaming)

16:04.641 --> 16:05.941
Do you have a lint roller?

16:05.942 --> 16:07.943
No! God! Wait, yes, I do.

16:07.944 --> 16:09.895
Can I borrow it? ‭Yep, yep.
Here you go.

16:09.896 --> 16:13.782
Welcome to
the Wagstaff Costume Contest!

16:13.783 --> 16:16.652
Let's kick off
this monster mash.

16:16.653 --> 16:19.154
(laughing)

16:19.155 --> 16:22.456
First, we have
Rudy Stieblitz as

16:22.492 --> 16:23.992
Marcel Marceau!

16:23.993 --> 16:25.626
(applause)

16:27.380 --> 16:31.917
And next we have Peter Pescadero
as the Mona Lisa.

16:31.918 --> 16:34.720
Isn't she
mysterious... sort of?

16:34.721 --> 16:36.304
(applause continues)

16:36.305 --> 16:40.592
And next is Tina Belcher
as a sand-witch.

16:40.593 --> 16:43.478
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

16:43.479 --> 16:44.929
(gasps)

16:45.014 --> 16:47.460
Here I go, from bread to dead.

16:49.167 --> 16:51.168
(nervous laughing)
Ha, ha, ha.

16:51.169 --> 16:52.603
(harsh whisper):
Tina! Let's keep it moving!

16:52.604 --> 16:54.488
Ha, ha, ha. ‭LOUISE: Psst. Tina.

16:54.489 --> 16:56.573
What's going on up there?

16:56.574 --> 17:00.277
You're going a weird way
with the sand-witch character.

17:00.278 --> 17:01.862
No one gets it.

17:01.863 --> 17:03.697
I think the curse
is gonna happen now,

17:03.698 --> 17:05.082
while I'm on stage.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.500
(groans) What if I fall?

17:06.501 --> 17:07.867
Um, well, Gene and I

17:07.868 --> 17:09.752
can stay down here
and walk next to you.

17:09.753 --> 17:11.338
We'll catch you.

17:11.339 --> 17:13.207
And then we'll pass you
around like you were

17:13.208 --> 17:15.008
intentionally crowd-surfing.

17:15.009 --> 17:16.542
(groans) ‭Excuse me. Pardon me.

17:16.544 --> 17:18.262
Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me.
‭Excuse me. Pardon me.

17:18.262 --> 17:19.930
(harsh whisper):
Tina, what is going on?

17:19.931 --> 17:23.133
I know this isn't normally
how you walk down a catwalk.

17:23.134 --> 17:25.051
I'm walking slowly
because something terrible

17:25.053 --> 17:27.054
is gonna happen to me right now.

17:27.055 --> 17:30.224
I accidentally pissed off the
wrong witch, and now I'm cursed.

17:30.225 --> 17:32.109
Wait. Were we supposed
to prepare a speech?

17:32.110 --> 17:33.893
I don't know.

17:33.978 --> 17:35.896
Maybe I got
a little carried away.

17:35.897 --> 17:38.114
Maybe I-I shouldn't
have cast so many spells.

17:38.199 --> 17:41.118
On you. And you. And you.
Lot of love spells. Sorry.

17:41.119 --> 17:43.454
Ugh! What?
What are you talking about?

17:43.455 --> 17:44.988
I also cast a spell
to win this contest,

17:44.989 --> 17:46.539
and I know I shouldn't
have done that.

17:46.574 --> 17:48.208
But now that I think
about it, I'm not sure

17:48.209 --> 17:49.626
my spells worked
in the first place.

17:49.627 --> 17:51.495
I mean, I don't even know
if this stuff is real.

17:51.496 --> 17:52.996
I think it was more
just something

17:52.997 --> 17:54.380
that made me feel
more confident.

17:54.415 --> 17:56.333
Jimmy Jr., maybe
you just responded

17:56.334 --> 17:58.584
to my bold attitude
and choker necklace.

17:58.670 --> 18:00.920
Eh, I don't know.
I liked it!

18:01.005 --> 18:02.422
And come to think of it,
Gene always

18:02.423 --> 18:03.890
has fish sticks in his locker.

18:03.925 --> 18:05.225
Oh, yeah, I do.

18:05.226 --> 18:06.426
And maybe Ms. Labonz
getting jury duty

18:06.427 --> 18:07.978
was just a coincidence.

18:07.979 --> 18:10.063
He was guilty.
We were done before lunch.

18:10.064 --> 18:12.431
I went to the mall
for the rest of the day.

18:12.517 --> 18:15.235
Okay. (chuckles) We're just
gonna keep moving along.

18:15.236 --> 18:17.236
And next we have Tammy Larson

18:17.272 --> 18:19.273
dressed as a hot mess.
‭(grunting)

18:19.274 --> 18:21.325
Love it. So original.

18:21.326 --> 18:23.827
(groans) Hot mess. That's how
this whole thing started!

18:23.828 --> 18:26.078
I wanted to win
the contest so bad.

18:26.114 --> 18:28.749
I'm sorry I got myself
into this stupid curse!

18:28.750 --> 18:31.501
I'm sorry I said those things
to you, Jackie. I'm sorry!

18:31.586 --> 18:32.920
And I'm sorry I ever
listened to you

18:32.921 --> 18:34.453
about witchcraft, Mr. Ambrose!

18:34.506 --> 18:36.840
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

18:36.841 --> 18:38.791
(harsh whisper):
Stop it! Shh!

18:38.843 --> 18:40.344
Jackie, if you're gonna
do something to me,

18:40.345 --> 18:42.379
just do it already!
I'm done being a witch,

18:42.380 --> 18:43.797
and I'm done with this curse!
(groans)

18:43.798 --> 18:45.182
I'm just gonna try
and be more confident

18:45.183 --> 18:46.517
and less mean
to crossing guards.

18:46.518 --> 18:47.601
I know that's a really cliché
thing to say,

18:47.602 --> 18:48.719
but I mean it.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.137
Move it, loaf!
(grunts)

18:50.138 --> 18:51.638
Whoa!

18:51.639 --> 18:53.190
I got her! I got her!
I got her! I got her!

18:53.191 --> 18:55.442
Oh, no! Aah!
(screams)

18:55.443 --> 18:57.778
(audience gasps) TINA: I'm okay!
Tammy broke my fall.

18:57.779 --> 18:59.612
TAMMY: Oh, my God,
I can't feel my legs!

18:59.647 --> 19:01.365
TINA: Those are my legs.
TAMMY: Ew! Gross!

19:01.366 --> 19:02.649
Get your legs off me!

19:02.650 --> 19:04.952
Congratulations, Rudy.

19:04.953 --> 19:06.486
Sorry you fell, Tina.

19:06.487 --> 19:08.372
Not our fault. We were
nailing it, for the record.

19:08.373 --> 19:10.957
Do we have to keep spotting you
for the rest of your life?

19:10.992 --> 19:12.792
I don't know. I guess maybe?

19:12.827 --> 19:14.912
Uh-oh. Here comes Jackie.
Louise, hands up.

19:14.913 --> 19:16.662
Here we go.
‭Uh...

19:16.748 --> 19:19.633
I accept your apology.
Here's your barrette.

19:19.634 --> 19:22.169
Consider yourself un-cursed.

19:22.170 --> 19:25.088
Okay, phew. You have to admit,
we got a little crazy.

19:25.089 --> 19:26.840
I mean,
you more than me, but...

19:26.841 --> 19:28.175
Re-cursed!
What?!

19:28.176 --> 19:30.260
Kidding! Oh. Good. ‭Whew!

19:30.261 --> 19:31.762
You got me.
I mean, don't get me.

19:31.763 --> 19:33.597
I mean, we're cool, right?
(nervous laugh)

19:33.598 --> 19:35.515
(cackles)

19:35.516 --> 19:37.683
Uh, sorry, that's just my laugh.
Yeah, we're cool.

19:37.735 --> 19:40.737
Bob, you can't just stare
at Jimmy Pesto all day.

19:40.738 --> 19:42.271
He's gonna try
for it, Lin.

19:42.357 --> 19:44.157
I know he's coming
for this one.

19:44.158 --> 19:45.491
Oh, my God!

19:45.526 --> 19:46.826
Mr. Fischoeder!
What are you doing?

19:46.861 --> 19:48.028
Hello, Bob.

19:48.029 --> 19:49.029
I'm taking this
jack-o'-lantern home

19:49.030 --> 19:50.830
to put with the others.

19:50.865 --> 19:53.499
Wait. You're the one who's been
stealing my jack-o'-lanterns?

19:53.534 --> 19:55.786
Stealing? No. I thought
we had an understanding.

19:55.787 --> 19:58.789
You carve them and leave them
out, and then I take them.

19:58.790 --> 20:00.707
It's-it's like how people
keep giving me bikes.

20:00.708 --> 20:02.175
That's insane.

20:02.176 --> 20:03.460
Well, you're the one
who keeps doing it.

20:03.461 --> 20:05.711
How many have you made,
four, five?

20:05.797 --> 20:07.347
Well, what are you doing
with them?

20:07.348 --> 20:08.715
What aren't I
doing with them?

20:08.716 --> 20:10.384
Come to my house tonight
and I'll show you.

20:10.385 --> 20:11.385
Um...

20:11.386 --> 20:14.304
Welcome to Jack-O-Land!

20:14.305 --> 20:16.889
Your Halloween just got
a little Halloween-er.

20:16.941 --> 20:20.776
Wow! Oh, it's so pretty.
And spooky.

20:20.862 --> 20:22.813
See how much less pathetic
they look over here

20:22.814 --> 20:24.614
than they did on your sidewalk?

20:24.699 --> 20:26.650
Oh, it's like night and day.
Linda.

20:26.651 --> 20:29.486
What? They're happy
here. Look at them.

20:29.487 --> 20:31.203
We could never give them
all this.

20:31.239 --> 20:32.906
Children, you want a picture

20:32.907 --> 20:34.875
with your father's
burg-o'-lanterns?

20:34.876 --> 20:36.460
- Sure. Yes! ‭Okay.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:36.461 --> 20:37.744
That's, uh, five dollars.

20:37.745 --> 20:38.911
Father, pay the man.

20:38.997 --> 20:40.330
I'm not paying
for a picture

20:40.331 --> 20:42.215
of you with
my jack-o'-lanterns.

20:42.216 --> 20:44.418
Come on, Bob.
It's Halloween.

20:44.419 --> 20:46.753
(sighs) Fine.
(kids cheering)

20:46.754 --> 20:48.754
Where do you want these bikes,
Mr. Fischoeder?

20:48.840 --> 20:51.224
Around the back, Freddy!
You got it.

20:51.225 --> 20:54.143
Good man. ‭Teddy.
It's Teddy. His name's Teddy.
