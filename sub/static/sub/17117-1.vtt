16:20.970 --> 16:23.900
Pull up easy. The
temperature in Newark is 54.

16:23.970 --> 16:27.530
In Morristown it's 57,
and in Asbury Park..

17:21.030 --> 17:25.990
Saint Dominic's: 2,712.

17:26.060 --> 17:28.460
Saint Michael's: 983.

17:28.530 --> 17:32.060
What do you have on Saint Bartholomew?

17:32.140 --> 17:34.500
Fifty-eight. 5,800?

17:34.570 --> 17:36.510
George, what about Loyola?

17:36.570 --> 17:39.100
All right, up against the wall!

17:39.180 --> 17:41.110
What is this? What's going on?

17:41.910 --> 17:45.080
My dear friends, you have
come together in this church..

17:45.150 --> 17:47.080
that the Lord may seal
and strengthen your love..

17:47.150 --> 17:50.680
in the presence of the church's
minister and this community.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.690
Christ abundantly blesses you.

17:52.760 --> 17:56.160
Oh, my God! Get that money!

17:56.230 --> 17:59.820
What are you doing? Do you
know whose parish this is?

17:59.900 --> 18:01.990
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.

18:02.070 --> 18:04.630
May daily problems never
cause you anxiety..

18:04.700 --> 18:08.040
or the desire for earthly
possessions dominate your lives.

18:08.110 --> 18:10.340
May you find happiness and
satisfaction in your work.

18:12.140 --> 18:15.630
Just kiss that pipe, boys.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.340
Shut up!

18:19.420 --> 18:21.610
You have declared your
consent before the church.

18:21.690 --> 18:25.780
May the Lord strengthen your consent
and fill you with His blessings.

18:25.860 --> 18:28.590
What God has joined man must not divide.

18:28.660 --> 18:31.360
Leave the change alone!

18:32.830 --> 18:35.320
Don't touch it. Beautiful.

18:35.400 --> 18:39.770
May Almighty God bless you. The
Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.

18:51.850 --> 18:53.040
We've been hit!

18:54.750 --> 18:56.410
Son of a bitch!

18:57.890 --> 19:02.020
In the days I went a-courtin.
I was never tired of resortin..

19:02.090 --> 19:05.760
To the ale house or the playhouse
And many's the house besides.

19:05.830 --> 19:09.930
As sure as me name is Barney
I'll be off to "Californy".

19:10.000 --> 19:13.370
Instead of diggin praddies
I'll be diggin lumps of coal..

19:23.710 --> 19:27.280
Don't get us glommed over. No way.

19:27.350 --> 19:29.480
We've already got a driver in the car.

19:31.690 --> 19:33.620
Keep it up.

19:34.730 --> 19:36.960
Don't press me, pal.

19:37.030 --> 19:39.260
Couldn't you have stopped
him without doing that?

19:39.330 --> 19:41.460
Shut your mouth before you get it.

19:41.530 --> 19:45.130
What do you mean? Just what
I'm tellin' ya, hard on.

19:47.740 --> 19:50.760
If you'd shoot a priest for
$67,000, how much is my life worth?

19:50.840 --> 19:52.430
Zero.

19:52.510 --> 19:54.440
You're a piece of shit.

19:55.810 --> 19:58.300
You bastard! What are you doing?

19:58.380 --> 20:00.250
Look out!

20:26.080 --> 20:30.380
He's gone! He's gone!

20:30.450 --> 20:32.440
We better leave 'em
till the cops get here.

20:49.370 --> 20:50.700
Ooh!

21:10.620 --> 21:12.050
Call another ambulance.

21:13.920 --> 21:17.760
There's one in back. There's
a guy in the car here.

21:17.830 --> 21:19.730
Hurt awful bad.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.860
Everybody stay out of the way
and let these guys through.

21:33.180 --> 21:35.110
Hey, Mickey, over here!

22:04.440 --> 22:07.840
What's the latest on
your brother, Mr. Ricci?

22:07.910 --> 22:10.880
He's gonna be all right.
That's fine. Thank God.

22:12.580 --> 22:16.080
One of those pigs walked
away from that accident.

22:16.150 --> 22:17.810
His name is Jackie Scanlon.

22:17.890 --> 22:20.380
He's a punk from Queens
with the Donnelly mob.

22:20.460 --> 22:21.890
Real piece of shit.

22:23.730 --> 22:26.160
Mr. Ricci, everybody
wants to help you on this.

22:26.230 --> 22:28.060
The guy can't make a move.

22:28.970 --> 22:29.960
He can't go nowheres.

22:30.030 --> 22:32.590
Could be on his way to the moon by now.

22:32.670 --> 22:36.110
We'll get the best, but it's gonna
have to come from the outside..

22:36.170 --> 22:37.660
and it's gonna cost.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.310
He robbed my church.

22:41.380 --> 22:43.940
Shot my brother.

22:44.010 --> 22:48.780
I don't care where he is or
what it costs. I want his ass.

23:05.670 --> 23:08.370
You got a problem. Tell me about it.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.810
You're on the hit parade. What?

23:11.880 --> 23:14.640
That priest you whacked
was Carlo Ricci's brother.

23:14.710 --> 23:18.550
Forget the heat. Ricci
himself is out looking for you.

23:18.620 --> 23:23.480
I never carry a pistol. Want
to tell him that in person?

23:23.550 --> 23:25.580
Got any money?

23:25.660 --> 23:27.090
Two thousand.

23:27.890 --> 23:30.050
How about a passport? What for?

23:30.130 --> 23:32.650
For 2,000 I'll get you a passport.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.890
You mean out of the country? Uh-huh.

23:38.570 --> 23:41.560
Where? A good place to stay low.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.040
Why?

23:43.110 --> 23:45.700
It's a place nobody wants to look in.

23:47.740 --> 23:49.180
It's covered, okay?

23:49.250 --> 23:51.580
Where am I going? Get
a train in Baltimore.

23:51.650 --> 23:53.580
Go to pier 47.

23:53.650 --> 23:56.240
At customs, ask for Nat Glick.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.480
Don't mention my name.

23:58.560 --> 24:02.690
As of right now, I don't know
you and I don't want to know you.

24:02.760 --> 24:06.530
I owed you a favor. This is it.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.620
You gonna tell me where I'm going?

24:08.700 --> 24:10.630
I swear to Christ, I don't know.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.430
Arriba!! Fuerza atras!

28:04.130 --> 28:06.800
 Vamos!! Arriba!! Arriba!

28:06.870 --> 28:09.000

28:09.070 --> 28:11.040

28:11.110 --> 28:13.200
 Arriba! Eso..

28:14.110 --> 28:16.170
No!

28:36.400 --> 28:37.830
Ramirez.

28:39.340 --> 28:40.630
Serrano.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.010
Marquez.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.900
Transito? Pase.

30:25.740 --> 30:29.510
Transito. Pase. Pasaporte.
Pase. Pasaporte. Pase.

30:29.580 --> 30:30.740
I am in transit? Que?

30:30.810 --> 30:32.180
Transito, me.

30:32.250 --> 30:36.980
I am going to Managua.
Ah, Managua. Si. Pase.

30:41.560 --> 30:45.390
Can I get something to drink? Pasaporte.

30:45.460 --> 30:49.630
In the plane with my
baggage. I. m very thirsty.

30:54.870 --> 30:56.200
Pase.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.860
Forget it, pal.

31:25.940 --> 31:29.870
Stop eating. A year's pay might get you
a seat to the next rat hole. Come on.

31:56.770 --> 31:59.830
I have three rooms.

32:16.450 --> 32:19.080
One of them's taken.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.780
Agrippa, traeme las llaves.

32:43.850 --> 32:45.280
I'll take it.

32:45.350 --> 32:47.280
For how long? Let's say a week.

33:18.950 --> 33:21.080
Aqui esta. Espere.

33:21.950 --> 33:23.650
Esperate alla.

33:45.380 --> 33:48.340
How much do you suppose
from here to Argentina?

33:48.410 --> 33:52.180
An airline ticket costs 470 pesos.

33:52.250 --> 33:55.650
Passports, maybe another thousand.

33:55.720 --> 33:58.240
I have less than 100.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.290
Everything I could save in a year.

34:01.420 --> 34:06.360
My house, maybe for
600, if I could sell it.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.670
 Comprende ingles?

34:22.080 --> 34:23.510
Yes, I speak some.

34:23.580 --> 34:27.239
Want to travel away? Yes.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.909
I can fix for you la capital.

34:29.989 --> 34:34.050
I want to go out of this country.
Out of this country? Dificil.

34:34.120 --> 34:36.090
Very difficult.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.650
Impossible?

34:37.730 --> 34:40.659
No, es posible. Costoso.

34:40.730 --> 34:42.630
Comprende? Cost much.

34:43.530 --> 34:44.800
Comprende.

35:04.290 --> 35:07.220
I can fix for you to
go out from the country.

35:07.290 --> 35:12.560
This reloj plus 1,000
pesos. I have only the watch.

35:38.150 --> 35:39.520
Whiskey.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.030
Danke shon.

35:51.100 --> 35:54.540
Put it on my account. Thank you.

36:00.510 --> 36:03.340
During the work it's hotter.

36:03.410 --> 36:07.040
Yeah. I like a southern exposure. Yes.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.480
I thought about it myself.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.090
I understand you used to be in banking.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.100
That's the rumor.

36:21.260 --> 36:24.320
I had no idea I was the subject of rumors.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.730
Carlos used to be an ex Reichs Marschall.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.240
Right, Carlos?

36:32.440 --> 36:35.670
What is your profession, Mr..?

36:35.750 --> 36:39.080
Dominguez. Dominguez.

36:39.150 --> 36:40.410
Ice hockey.

36:42.390 --> 36:44.720
Read about this place
in a travel brochure?

36:45.660 --> 36:48.590
I heard it had a healthy climate.

36:49.860 --> 36:52.760
Not what you expected.

36:52.830 --> 36:55.350
It was exactly what I expected.

37:13.050 --> 37:14.480
Juan Dominguez?

37:17.050 --> 37:18.990
Aren't you the laborer, Juan Dominguez?

37:19.060 --> 37:22.050
Oiga, le estamos hablando. No comprendo.

37:27.830 --> 37:29.130
No.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.030
You don't understand, huh?

37:33.100 --> 37:35.040
Let's see your identity card.

37:36.140 --> 37:37.400
 Como?

37:37.470 --> 37:39.960
The identity card you keep here.

37:50.220 --> 37:53.190
Juan Dominguez, born November 1939..

37:53.260 --> 37:55.990
in Las Calumnas in this country.

37:59.100 --> 38:01.030
That is you?

38:01.930 --> 38:04.870
You don't look to me like
you were born in Las Calumnas.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.100
 Por que?

38:07.170 --> 38:09.570
Because you don't even speak Spanish.

38:09.640 --> 38:13.200
And because you are a
filthy gringo asshole.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.570
Es un asunto muy serio.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.810
This is false.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.910
It's a violation of the immigration laws.

38:19.980 --> 38:22.580
Piernas asi. Manos encima del bar.

38:22.650 --> 38:24.750
Atras!! Mas atras!! No te muevas!

38:26.990 --> 38:28.250
Hey!

38:59.360 --> 39:01.520
Mas? Tienes mas?

39:05.660 --> 39:07.600
Do you have more?

39:07.660 --> 39:08.860
That's it.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.090
Que cabron es. Tiene plata.

39:13.570 --> 39:16.370
Okay, next time you pay.

39:17.640 --> 39:19.610
You make three..

39:20.610 --> 39:22.700
we take one.

39:22.780 --> 39:24.210
Understand?

39:26.780 --> 39:27.840
Comprendo.

39:27.920 --> 39:30.180
Okay.

39:30.250 --> 39:32.810
Puedes irte. Fuera.

39:32.890 --> 39:35.380
I need my card.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.650
Que?! Fuera!

39:39.000 --> 39:42.260
I can't make shit without my card.

39:42.330 --> 39:45.320
I need that. Ah.

39:45.400 --> 39:46.830
La tarjeta. Si.

39:48.500 --> 39:49.940
Para trabajar.

39:50.970 --> 39:52.410
Para ganar.

40:06.220 --> 40:09.160
Adios, señor Dominguez.

40:41.290 --> 40:45.690
It should produce twice as much as
this last zone that we come out of.

40:45.760 --> 40:47.560
When can you get this one pinched off?

40:47.630 --> 40:51.360
Our trucks have already been ordered.

40:51.430 --> 40:52.920
They should be here.

41:19.660 --> 41:21.690
Cuidado!

41:21.760 --> 41:25.330
Alejense del campo!! Afuera!! Afuera!

41:50.060 --> 41:51.490
Very professional.

41:51.560 --> 41:54.090
Get it to the capital.
Maybe we'll get results.

41:54.160 --> 41:56.390
The government's been
told it was an accident.

41:57.400 --> 41:58.870
What?

41:58.930 --> 42:03.100
In this country, terrorists who blow
up American oil wells are heroes.

42:03.170 --> 42:06.110
We're paying that government
to give us protection.

42:06.180 --> 42:08.370
El presidente cannot
risk his liberal image..

42:08.440 --> 42:10.940
by sending us troops to chase patriots.

42:11.010 --> 42:12.450
Shit!

42:13.320 --> 42:15.940
This is a telex from home
responding to my report.

42:16.020 --> 42:17.850
First part concerns..

42:17.920 --> 42:21.720
regret loss of life,
etcetera, injuries and so on.

42:21.790 --> 42:25.160
Apparently we have no insurance
position because of the sabotage thing.

42:25.230 --> 42:27.750
This is the part that concerns you.

42:27.830 --> 42:29.860
"Limitations on production
in recent months.."

42:29.930 --> 42:32.630
due to acts of terrorism and
political uncertainties..

42:32.700 --> 42:36.600
emphasize attention immediate
supply obligations..

42:36.670 --> 42:39.110
with minimum concern R & D..

42:39.180 --> 42:40.610
What is R & D?

42:40.680 --> 42:43.240
Research and Development.

42:43.310 --> 42:46.180
"Please apprise course
of action soonest.."

42:46.250 --> 42:48.810
It's signed.. Weber..

42:49.690 --> 42:51.120
Is that it?

42:51.190 --> 42:52.620
Yes.

43:06.970 --> 43:09.630
What are the immediate supply obligations?

43:09.710 --> 43:14.470
One tanker, 160,000 barrels
by the end of next month.

43:14.540 --> 43:16.840
We need that well to fill it.

43:16.910 --> 43:18.850
They'll have to delay it.

43:21.480 --> 43:23.080
They can't.

43:23.150 --> 43:25.450
Charter's running. If we have
to take a loss that big..

43:25.520 --> 43:28.550
we might as well shut
down now and save expenses.

44:05.760 --> 44:09.030
Asesinos!

44:51.540 --> 44:53.740
Mi papa!! Mi papa!

45:01.320 --> 45:03.810
 Fuera gringos!! Fuera gringos!

45:03.890 --> 45:06.180
Malditos desgraciados!

45:14.600 --> 45:16.830
Hay que matar a esos gringos!

45:23.940 --> 45:27.100
Asesinos!! Asesinos!

48:06.240 --> 48:08.200
I've seen worse.

48:12.010 --> 48:13.940
Let's clear away that
junk and blow her out.

48:51.510 --> 48:53.140
Dame el machete.

48:57.190 --> 48:58.550
Esta bueno.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.030
This stuff is too dry to spark.

50:32.510 --> 50:34.510
That stuff has been sitting for a year.

50:34.580 --> 50:37.680
It's worthless. What do you mean?

50:37.750 --> 50:39.740
When it sits a long time
without being turned..

50:39.820 --> 50:42.290
that liquid nitro seeps out
of the sticks and into the bag.

50:42.360 --> 50:44.660
If you give those cases any
kind of a bump, it'll blow.

50:48.160 --> 50:52.430
It's risky moving a case ten feet.
That fire's over 200 miles away.

50:53.370 --> 50:55.460
If it were up there, could you use it?

50:56.910 --> 50:59.400
We could boom-load a
little at a time. Yes.

50:59.470 --> 51:01.470
How you gonna get it there?

51:01.540 --> 51:04.240
That's not your problem.
We'll get it there.

51:21.330 --> 51:23.390
What do you think?

51:23.470 --> 51:27.090
The major problem is the vibration.
This thing is like an egg beater.

51:27.170 --> 51:31.770
No matter how we shock-mount something,
it will have a severe lateral vibration.

51:31.840 --> 51:35.780
I thought maybe you could
swing-load it on a pallet.

51:35.840 --> 51:39.470
Twenty feet down there's no vibration,
but the problem is turbulence.

51:39.550 --> 51:42.110
We might move it half a
mile that way but not 200.

51:42.180 --> 51:44.950
We've never had a flight here
without some turbulence in it.

51:47.690 --> 51:49.280
What are you saying?

51:49.360 --> 51:51.790
Not with a chopper. There's no way.

51:53.900 --> 51:55.860
I'll double the amount
if you can think of a way.

51:55.930 --> 51:59.330
It's not the money. Nobody's gonna
get into a chopper with that shit.

51:59.400 --> 52:01.060
You need a suicide jockey.

52:03.370 --> 52:06.810
We now need experienced truck drivers..

52:06.880 --> 52:09.110
men who are willing to do a dangerous job.

52:09.180 --> 52:11.910
This job must be done..

52:11.980 --> 52:17.040
before we can reopen our gates and
bring back full employment to you people.

52:17.120 --> 52:22.990
The men who qualify will
receive exceptional wages.

52:23.060 --> 52:26.050
Only experienced truck drivers
willing to risk their life can do it.

52:26.130 --> 52:28.060
No one else should apply.

52:28.130 --> 52:31.500
The company will pay
8,000 pesos to each driver.

52:35.700 --> 52:37.930
Wait a minute!

52:38.010 --> 52:39.370
 Silencio, por favor!

52:40.880 --> 52:42.970
Four men with enough guts..

52:43.050 --> 52:45.210
can save Poza Rica and your village!

52:57.360 --> 53:01.020
Stop at the bottom of the hill.
I need to know the machine.

53:01.100 --> 53:02.530
Pull over.

53:41.170 --> 53:43.400
You crazy bastard!

53:58.190 --> 54:00.680
Teamster?

54:00.760 --> 54:02.190
Greyhound.

54:09.200 --> 54:10.290
Vamos.

54:20.510 --> 54:23.340
Serrano.

54:23.410 --> 54:25.110
Dominguez.

54:25.180 --> 54:26.840
Marquez.

54:26.920 --> 54:29.180
Martinez. Pueden quedarse.

54:29.250 --> 54:32.550
Los demas, pueden irse.

59:32.520 --> 59:34.820
We're carrying three cases each.

59:34.890 --> 59:39.120
One is enough to blow your fire. Six
cases will blow out the whole field.

59:39.190 --> 59:42.890
You don't think all the trucks
will make it. One of us is a backup.

59:42.960 --> 59:48.100
We want double, and legal
residence, or we don't drive.

59:53.070 --> 59:55.130
You leave in four hours.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.260
Only one machete?

01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:53.770
How many would you like?

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:57.170
Have to put half the jungle underneath
our wheels to get through the mud.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.170
How many machetes you want us to carry?

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.170
Should be two.

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:04.900
Condensers. Points.

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.570
Floats. Filters.

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.210
Tape. Wire. Channel locks.

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:12.840
Rags.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.750
Where's the rest of
this cable? In the car.

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:19.760
Where the hell is the German?

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:22.890
Toque el claxon.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.000
Que quiere?

01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:29.060
Tengo algo para el señor Serrano.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.810
She's got something for you.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.370
Para su buena suerte, señor Serrano.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:44.980
What is it?

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:50.920
Toque el claxon otra vez.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.910
Marquez!

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.150
Marquez!

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:08.030
Murderer! Zionist! I'll kill you!

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.440
What happened? What happened?

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:13.670
This Jew dog cut his throat!

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.370
Vete a avisar a la policia. No police.

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:18.710
Vete a la policia.

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:22.010
Hold it! We lost a driver.
We need another one.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.380
When the money's up, I'm
as good as any of you.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.460
Where you from?

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:11.060
Listen, Pancho, I've been clocking you
every second that you got into this town.

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:14.070
If you pick your nose in this
truck, clear it with me first..

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.630
or I'll take you and
this nitro into a ditch.

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:01.170
They've had 15 minutes.

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.480
Yes.

01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:04.980
One moment.

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.760
I have a letter.

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:14.120
I wonder if you would
post it for me? Paris.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.930
That could take a month. Yes.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.800
Just keep it for me.
I'll take care of it.

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.109
Get outta there!

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.700
Fuera!! Fuera!

01:08:25.090 --> 01:08:27.710
Esta loco!

01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:30.620
Ha-ha-ha!

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:32.560
Get the hell outta there!

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:40.290
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:25.779
I guide you.

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.840
No. You drive, and I guide you. Okay?

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.580
Get in the truck.

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:33.340
Come on! No!

01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:34.740
Come on!

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.910
Okay.

01:13:58.190 --> 01:14:00.680
Is this the road to Poza Rica?

01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:21.640
Esta loco.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.640
That's the wrong road.

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:52.670
I think this road's better
for us because it's higher.

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.110
We take this one.

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:58.630
You don't understand. This road is
too low. It goes through the swamp.

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:00.680
There's too much mud.

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:04.680
Can't you read a map? We have
no information on that road.

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:09.010
You're full of shit! You take that road!

01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:13.350
We follow the map.

01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:02.240
It's the wrong road.

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.180
This is the wrong road!

01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:07.400
Where the hell are you going?

01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:17.650
We're going across that bridge..

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.710
and you're going to guide me..

01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:21.810
because I can't do it alone.

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:23.260
They've had it.

01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:27.030
We're sitting on double
shares. 20,000 apiece!

01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:31.410
No way they're gonna make
that bridge, I'll tell ya that.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.670
That's 20,000 apiece.

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:37.080
We're sitting on 20,000. Double shares.

01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:52.790
Come on!

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.270
Come on!

01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:02.100
Stop! Stop!

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:15.550
Come on! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:21:19.690 --> 01:21:21.060
Stay close!

01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:43.980
Where are you?

01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:50.980
Where are you?

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:04.070
Stop! Stop!

01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:08.030
Stop! I don't see you!

01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:10.370
Stop! No!

01:22:11.410 --> 01:22:13.940
Stop! Stop!

01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:15.540
Stop! Stop!

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.710
No!

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.650
Are you all right?

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:39.370
The winch!

01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:44.100
Get the winch!

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.280
Come on!

01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:31.680
Come on! Come on!

01:24:46.230 --> 01:24:49.330
Come! Come!

01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.810
Come, come!

01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:36.070
Yes, come!

01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:48.920
Come!

01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:58.030
Come! Come! Come!

01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:07.640
Come on! Come! Come!

01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:16.520
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:39.400
You're crazy.

01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:28.750
It's eight trees!

01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:31.250
No way.

01:29:46.130 --> 01:29:48.070
Start chopping!

01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:53.000
Make your move.

01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:05.040
Kaoba.

01:31:05.110 --> 01:31:07.050
Excellent wood.

01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:11.140
We're going around it if
we can hack out eight trees.

01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:16.650
If you cut them down,
how do you move them?

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.160
The winch.

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:22.090
How are you going to clear the
stumps or drive through a swamp?

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:24.360
We're gonna go through it!

01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:25.860
Impossible.

01:31:25.930 --> 01:31:27.590
Impossible?

01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:30.650
I think I can clear it.

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:27.910
Too small.

01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:33.880
Show me your pockets.

01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.540
Perfect.

01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:36.310
Are you from Paris?

01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:38.940
I lived there. Yes. Where?

01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:42.870
Do you know Paris?

01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:45.420
I was there for two days.

01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:50.050
Very expensive. So they say.

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.350
Your family is there?

01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:56.660
My wife. Just my wife. No children?

01:41:56.730 --> 01:41:58.360
No children.

01:42:01.330 --> 01:42:04.600
I met my wife..

01:42:04.670 --> 01:42:08.900
when I first came to Paris.

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:21.650
The day she gave me this
was the last day I saw her.

01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:32.060
It's five minutes before 9:00 in Paris.

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:08.520
Dominguez.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.430
No te muevas!

01:44:20.710 --> 01:44:22.140
De rodillas!

01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:27.670
Get down.

01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:29.680
Get down on the ground!

01:44:34.150 --> 01:44:36.090
Saca al otro del camion.

01:44:41.490 --> 01:44:44.490
Vamos, para fuera!

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:45.860
 He dicho fuera!

01:44:59.010 --> 01:45:01.910
What do you have in the truck?

01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:06.010
Supplies.

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.680
What supplies?

01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:09.220
Vienna sausage.

01:45:10.290 --> 01:45:11.720
Wonder bread.

01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.060
Northern Tissue.

01:45:16.230 --> 01:45:17.660
Kleenex.

01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:21.030
Nothing else?

01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:26.360
Dice que el camion lleva provisiones.

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:31.540
Okay. So you got just what we need.
You don't have to be afraid from us.

01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:40.710
Es un loco! Oye, fuera!

01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:58.200
Listen, amigo, just come
out. We just need this truck.

01:45:58.270 --> 01:46:01.030
We need food, you know..

01:46:01.110 --> 01:46:03.770
and toilet paper.

01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:36.970
Hay un monton de explosivos!

01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:39.370
What are you gonna do with all that money?

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:41.870
Talk to me! What are you gonna do?

01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:45.370
Get laid.

01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:51.110
Best whore in Managua.

01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:54.640
Two whores.

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.160
Two best whores in Managua. You do it.

01:47:59.930 --> 01:48:02.160
Do it for me. With you, Pancho.

01:48:02.230 --> 01:48:06.390
You do it for me. Okay? I'll do it!

01:48:22.850 --> 01:48:25.040
What do you mean you don't know?

01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:30.890
Get a train down to
Baltimore. Go to pier 47.

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:35.220
Where am I goin.? Where am I goin.?

01:49:16.570 --> 01:49:17.900
Where am I goin.?

01:49:17.970 --> 01:49:19.960
What do you mean you don't know?

01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:23.640
It's good. No good to me.

01:54:23.710 --> 01:54:29.240
Do I take it to a bank, flash an I. D.,
give a thumbprint? Our deal was cash.

01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:33.550
Head office is sending
Gus Lefferts to meet you.

01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:36.250
He'll take you to our bank. You.
II have that cashed before supper.

01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:43.260
Ask Lefferts what's
available in the capital.

01:54:43.330 --> 01:54:45.350
I told him you were a first-rate driver.

01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:47.160
Not anymore.

01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:49.530
Yeah, well.

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.300
Find anything good, send a
postcard. Maybe I'll join you.

01:54:55.670 --> 01:54:58.440
You'd give all this up?

01:54:58.510 --> 01:55:01.910
In six months time, who
knows? I may have no choice.

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:06.780
Carlos! Traiganos
tres cervezas, por favor.

01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:12.750
You know, there, uh..
There's one place down here..

01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:16.490
that might be nice for
a guy in your situation.

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:19.620
Ever think of going to Managua?

01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:21.790
Managua?

01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:25.300
Shit! There's no way
I can go to Managua.

01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:27.840
Too bad. It's a nice place.

01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:32.040
No. Managua is no good for me.

01:55:34.710 --> 01:55:36.940
Carlos, haben sie Scotch, bitte?

01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:54.900
Oh, by the way, when you get into
Bonao, would you mail that for me?

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.700
- Do I have a couple of minutes?
- For you, they'll hold the plane.

01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:12.500
May I have this dance?
