02:02.500 --> 02:04.834
- Obituaries.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.367
A man or a woman lives
their entire life.

02:07.433 --> 02:11.400
They work and love
and dream and laugh and cry,

02:11.467 --> 02:12.500
then they die.

02:16.233 --> 02:18.133
And then somebody
who they don't even know,

02:18.200 --> 02:21.100
who's never met them once,

02:21.166 --> 02:24.033
boils their entire life down
to a paragraph or two

02:24.100 --> 02:25.800
in a local newspaper,

02:25.867 --> 02:27.367
and that's only if
they've achieved something,

02:27.433 --> 02:30.300
something that the editor
thinks is important.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.600
Now, if they're real movers,
real shakers,

02:32.667 --> 02:34.700
maybe they get two columns,

02:34.767 --> 02:38.000
maybe they get a photo
from 1974.

02:40.233 --> 02:43.266
And if they've achieved nothing,

02:43.333 --> 02:45.533
they get buried
at the bottom of the page,

02:45.600 --> 02:47.333
or ignored completely.

02:55.133 --> 02:58.000
- The homicide unit
has finished its investigation.

02:58.066 --> 02:59.767
Guillaume Tarrant
shot seven people

02:59.834 --> 03:02.000
before killing himself.

03:02.066 --> 03:04.400
Four people are dead:
Officer Joseph Howard,

03:04.467 --> 03:06.400
and prisoners Lou Rath,
Junior Pierce,

03:06.467 --> 03:08.100
and Kenny Wangler.
- What's the status

03:08.166 --> 03:10.533
of the other three inmates,
Keller, Cyran, and Ahmed?

03:10.600 --> 03:12.033
- They're all
at Benchley Memorial.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.800
Cyran and Ahmed
had superficial wounds.

03:14.867 --> 03:18.600
They should be back today,
but, Keller had internal damage.

03:18.667 --> 03:20.867
He'll be in the hospital awhile.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.500
You know,
I keep asking myself:

03:22.567 --> 03:25.300
How did that fucking gun
get in Oz?

03:25.367 --> 03:26.467
- I don't know, Murphy,

03:26.533 --> 03:29.400
but, I'm sure as Christ
gonna find out.

03:29.467 --> 03:31.767
- We don't know
where the gun came from.

03:31.834 --> 03:33.467
- Why you asking us?

03:33.533 --> 03:35.734
That was a white man's finger
on the trigger.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.700
- I'm talking to everyone.

03:37.767 --> 03:40.800
- Whether you find out
the truth or not,

03:40.867 --> 03:43.000
one thing is clear.

03:43.066 --> 03:45.166
Emerald City is out of control.

03:45.233 --> 03:47.734
McManus must go.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.934
- You telling me who to hire
and who to fire, Adebisi?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.700
- Just pointing out reality.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.567
- McManus was lax.

03:54.633 --> 03:57.200
Ultimately,
the responsibility is his.

03:57.266 --> 03:59.500
And you'd better act fast,
the press wants answers.

03:59.567 --> 04:01.333
Public wants someone to blame.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.900
- Thank you for your concern.

04:04.967 --> 04:07.633
- You two were very chummy
in there.

04:07.700 --> 04:10.633
Rare finding such agreement.

04:10.700 --> 04:14.033
- So, you are saying you don't
want McManus to get fired?

04:16.233 --> 04:19.133
- Zahir, what is going on?

04:19.200 --> 04:21.033
- What do you care?

04:21.100 --> 04:23.133
You lost the taste for power,
isn't that what you said?

04:23.200 --> 04:25.400
- Yeah.
- Then you're out of this.

04:25.467 --> 04:26.834
- Beginning of the day,

04:26.900 --> 04:29.433
the way, the wisdom,
the wish, the will to treat,

04:29.500 --> 04:31.166
to try, to trip.
- Shut up.

04:31.233 --> 04:32.600
- You can memorialize
them hacks...

04:32.667 --> 04:34.233
- Shut the fuck up already!
- But, my brothers,

04:34.300 --> 04:36.000
they on they backs
in corners like--

04:36.066 --> 04:38.734
like roaches after another
fucking raid sweepin'.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.133
- Enough!
Shut the fuck up, man!

04:40.200 --> 04:41.700
- Back on the thigh,
the glimmer in the eye.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.467
- Poet.

04:44.533 --> 04:47.100
Poet, enough.
- Stupid ass motherfucker.

04:47.166 --> 04:48.667
- Get the fuck away from me,
man.

04:48.734 --> 04:51.100
You know, Bricks--
Bricks and Junior is dead.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.967
They dead!
- You and me are alive.

04:54.033 --> 04:55.834
- Ain't got no heart, Adebisi.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.533
- I have a heart.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.667
I have a heart of a lion.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.600
Instead of crying
for Kenny and Junior,

05:02.667 --> 05:05.233
help me revenge them.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.100
- Revenge against who, Adebisi?

05:07.166 --> 05:10.834
You seen Tarrant
greased himself.

05:10.900 --> 05:13.934
- You see,
against them.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.967
All of those white bastards.

05:17.033 --> 05:19.033
- Wasn't no fucking
white bastard,

05:19.100 --> 05:20.533
that poured hot soup
on my face,

05:20.600 --> 05:21.800
scarring my skin.

05:21.867 --> 05:23.633
That was you.
That was you!

05:23.700 --> 05:26.266
- Yeah, that was then.
This is now.

05:26.333 --> 05:28.166
If you'd been standing
1 inch to the left

05:28.233 --> 05:29.767
when the shooting started,
you'd be dead

05:29.834 --> 05:33.867
and Kenny Wangler would be
my new best friend.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.567
- Yo, brother,
shit's going down.

05:40.633 --> 05:41.967
- Yeah, but, what?

05:42.033 --> 05:44.133
We're on the outside,
nose against the glass.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.266
- Yeah, not for long, brother.

05:46.333 --> 05:49.100
Fucking hacks want to know
how Frenchy got the gun.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.166
- And you know who did it?

05:51.233 --> 05:53.800
- Fucking coco, man.
Adebisi.

05:53.867 --> 05:56.367
I saw him with the gun
the day before the shooting.

05:56.433 --> 05:58.300
- Does Adebisi know you know?

05:58.367 --> 05:59.433
- Not yet, brah,

05:59.500 --> 06:03.000
but he gonna find out
soon enough.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.333
- Integrity.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.600
It's what sets
real leaders apart

06:10.667 --> 06:12.633
from typical politicians.

06:12.700 --> 06:16.166
One man running for governor
has real integrity.

06:16.233 --> 06:17.333
Alvah Case.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.100
Activist lawyer,
law school dean,

06:20.166 --> 06:22.100
State Bar president.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.767
Nobody questions his integrity.

06:24.834 --> 06:27.533
So, after the riots
at Oswald Prison,

06:27.600 --> 06:30.533
to whom did even James Devlin
turn to sort it out?

06:30.600 --> 06:31.800
That's right...

06:37.333 --> 06:39.367
- Wendy.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.567
- McManus has to go.

06:42.633 --> 06:44.033
- That seems to be
the mantra of the week.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.700
- Have you seen The Trib?

06:45.767 --> 06:47.567
Front page,
above the fold.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.967
"Prison Shooting
Leaves Four Dead."

06:50.033 --> 06:51.533
And two op-ed pieces.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.700
- I can handle
a little negative press.

06:53.767 --> 06:56.100
- Not if you want
to be lieutenant governor.

06:56.166 --> 06:59.266
You need a scapegoat.
You have to fire McManus.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.200
- Now's not the time.

07:01.266 --> 07:02.934
- He screwed things up
from the get-go.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.233
Have you forgotten the riot?
- The riot was not Tim's fault.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.166
- His entire history of Emerald
City has been a disaster.

07:09.233 --> 07:11.367
He's a weak,
limp-wristed liberal

07:11.433 --> 07:13.767
and you gotta toss him out
with the other garbage.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.567
- Here's your mail.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.734
You're welcome.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.500
- "Dear Tim,
I know by now

07:50.567 --> 07:52.266
that Sister Pete
has given you the news

07:52.333 --> 07:54.200
"that I'm not coming back to Oz.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.400
"This all must seem
unreal to you.

07:56.467 --> 07:58.600
"It sure as hell does to me.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.500
"When I left two weeks ago
on vacation,

08:00.567 --> 08:02.166
"I never dreamed my entire life

08:02.233 --> 08:05.000
"could turn around
so far so fast.

08:05.066 --> 08:07.767
"I never dreamed that
I'd meet a man like Cary.

08:07.834 --> 08:10.600
So loving,
so understanding..."

08:41.467 --> 08:44.000
- I've been asked
to pick one staff member

08:44.066 --> 08:46.867
to serve as part of
a state delegation

08:46.934 --> 08:48.600
that's going to South Africa

08:48.667 --> 08:51.800
for a discussion
of human rights issues.

08:51.867 --> 08:54.533
That group will visit
the Pretoria Prison,

08:54.600 --> 08:58.500
the Zonder Water Prison,
as well as go on a safari.

08:58.567 --> 09:00.200
- Sorry.

09:00.266 --> 09:02.500
Uh, Leo, I just want to talk
for one minute, okay?

09:02.567 --> 09:03.700
- Not now.
I'm in the middle of something.

09:03.767 --> 09:04.934
- Ah, yeah,
just one minute

09:05.000 --> 09:07.100
about Officer Howard's
memorial service.

09:07.166 --> 09:08.667
You know,
it's important, goddamn it,

09:08.734 --> 09:12.100
because the man was killed
right in front of me.

09:13.467 --> 09:15.500
- All right, go ahead.

09:17.533 --> 09:19.233
Okay, uh...

09:19.300 --> 09:21.500
I think that
we should videotape the ceremony

09:21.567 --> 09:25.433
so that when his grandkids
get older they can watch it.

09:26.867 --> 09:30.133
- Eternal rest grant unto him,
oh, Lord,

09:30.200 --> 09:33.200
and let perpetual light
shine down upon him.

09:33.266 --> 09:35.300
all: Amen.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.967
- And now, Tim McManus would
like to say a few words.

09:38.033 --> 09:40.200
Tim.

09:41.100 --> 09:45.867
- Uh,
Joe loved to bet on the horses,

09:45.934 --> 09:49.333
and so, in honor of him,
I would like to...

09:49.400 --> 09:52.633
♪ Camp town ladies

09:52.700 --> 09:55.700

10:15.100 --> 10:17.800
- Come in.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.000
- Leo, we want
to talk about Tim.

10:21.066 --> 10:23.033
I have had all the discussions

10:23.100 --> 10:24.367
about Tim McManus
I'm gonna have.

10:24.433 --> 10:26.300
- He's clearly in distress.

10:26.367 --> 10:27.767
- Yes.
- He needs help.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.867
- That's what I told him.
- So, you've seen him?

10:29.934 --> 10:32.266
- We've been looking everywhere.
- He just left.

10:32.333 --> 10:33.400
- Well, where'd he go?

10:33.467 --> 10:34.934
- I have no idea.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.500
- All right,
we'll try him at home tonight.

10:36.567 --> 10:38.266
- If not, we'll just
see him here tomorrow.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.700
- Right.
- I don't think so.

10:39.767 --> 10:40.900
- Why not?

10:40.967 --> 10:42.633
- I just fired him.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.800
Goodnight.

10:48.433 --> 10:51.200
- I saw this obituary once
of a guy I knew,

10:51.266 --> 10:55.166
and the newspaper
had misspelled his name.

10:55.233 --> 10:59.367
They misspelled his goddamn,
motherfucking name,

10:59.433 --> 11:01.734
and that's it.
It ain't no going back.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.333
It's not like they
gonna get his name right

11:03.400 --> 11:05.066
the next time he dies.

11:05.133 --> 11:07.734
No.
That edition of the newspaper

11:07.800 --> 11:10.734
is going in the archives.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.133
And this guy I know,
his name,

11:14.200 --> 11:17.266
which is probably the thing
he's proudest of in life,

11:17.333 --> 11:19.667
it's gonna be wrong

11:19.734 --> 11:22.500
forever and ever.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.633
- All right.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.133
Everybody, listen up.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.700
Last night,

11:50.767 --> 11:53.800
Tim McManus resigned
as unit manager of Emerald City.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.667
- All right, quiet down.

11:59.734 --> 12:02.000
Until a new unit manager
is named,

12:02.066 --> 12:04.467
the warden has asked me
to temporarily

12:04.533 --> 12:06.667
take over McManus' duties.

12:06.734 --> 12:08.066
Hear this.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.266
Nothing,

12:09.333 --> 12:11.300
and I mean nothing's
gonna change.

12:11.367 --> 12:14.233
- Yeah, that's what you think.
- Alright, that's it.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.266
- Officer Murphy,

12:19.333 --> 12:21.000
have you heard the latest
on Chris Keller?

12:21.066 --> 12:23.533
- Haven't heard anything new.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.133
- Could you call 'em
and check on his status?

12:26.200 --> 12:27.900
- Beecher, we had
a major incident here,

12:27.967 --> 12:29.834
all right?
Now, we lose Tim McManus.

12:29.900 --> 12:34.133
Your boyfriend's health
ain't a priority for me.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.667
- Please?

12:35.734 --> 12:37.367
- Go away.

12:40.066 --> 12:42.967
- I asked my father to locate
Schillinger's other son.

12:43.033 --> 12:46.300
- Oz didn't make you a bitch.

12:46.367 --> 12:48.100
You were born one.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.667
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

12:53.367 --> 12:54.967
- You were tormented
in your role in the death

12:55.033 --> 12:56.500
over Andrew ScHillinger.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.233
You went looking,
you came to me.

12:58.300 --> 13:00.900
You asked for guidance
in the ways of Islam.

13:00.967 --> 13:02.934
You felt comfort,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.600
peace of mind
in the arms of Allah.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.500
But, you have this

13:07.567 --> 13:09.333
thing

13:09.400 --> 13:11.533
between you and Keller.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.166
Homosexual acts are blasphemy.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.600
I know that.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.266
I don't want to love him,
Kareem,

13:21.333 --> 13:23.367
but, I do.

13:23.433 --> 13:24.834
And as for Allah,

13:24.900 --> 13:27.166
I'll take my chances with him
when the time comes.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.166
- Hey, Beecher.

13:34.233 --> 13:36.600
Sorry about what happened
to your little butt buddy.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.767
Of course, knowing that kind,

13:38.834 --> 13:40.166
he's probably fucked
half his nurses

13:40.233 --> 13:43.433
and a couple orderlies by now.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.500
Hope he don't come back to you

13:44.567 --> 13:46.266
with any of them
staph infections.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.100
- Toby.
Hey, Dad.

14:00.166 --> 14:02.533
- Oh.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.300
Good news.

14:04.367 --> 14:08.333
We found Hank ScHillinger,
by the way.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.200
- Well, Jesus, that was fast.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.467
- Well, I told you,
Swannie's the best,

14:12.533 --> 14:14.333
and if you turn
over the right rock,

14:14.400 --> 14:16.500
you'll find a worm.

14:16.567 --> 14:18.533
- Meaning?

14:18.600 --> 14:21.100
- Hank Schillinger's
one screwed up kid.

14:21.166 --> 14:23.400
Swannie said he's a--
he's a drug addict,

14:23.467 --> 14:25.300
he's a petty thief.

14:25.367 --> 14:28.900
He pimped his girlfriend.

14:28.967 --> 14:31.400
- How long before he'll come
and visit ScHillinger?

14:31.467 --> 14:33.667
- Well, there's one
slight complication.

14:33.734 --> 14:37.066
Boy says he won't come
unless he gets paid.

14:37.133 --> 14:38.233
- Paid.
How much?

14:38.300 --> 14:39.633
- I don't know.

14:39.700 --> 14:42.967
Probably what it'll cost
to get him his next high.

14:43.033 --> 14:45.967
Mm.

14:46.033 --> 14:48.133
Make the deal.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.967
- Toby.
- Make the deal, Dad.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.266
- Vern.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.700
- What the hell--sorry,
heck do you want?

15:04.767 --> 15:06.166
- You have a visitor.

15:06.233 --> 15:09.934
- What, suddenly you're
my appointment secretary?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.767
- Hank is here.

15:11.834 --> 15:13.367
- Hank?

15:13.433 --> 15:15.767
My hank?

15:29.400 --> 15:32.667
- Your father's on his way.

15:32.734 --> 15:35.734
- So, when do I get
the other half of the money?

15:35.800 --> 15:38.166
- When you're done.

15:38.233 --> 15:39.667
- Cool.

15:39.734 --> 15:41.834
So, bring him on.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.367
How long is this gonna take?

15:47.433 --> 15:50.100
'cause I gotta meet somebody.

15:54.100 --> 15:57.900
Dude, you look awesome.

15:57.967 --> 16:00.033
- Hello, son.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.200
- Skinny as shit.

16:02.266 --> 16:03.367
They don't feed you in here?

16:03.433 --> 16:05.233
- Oh.

16:05.300 --> 16:08.600
Oh, God!
Good to see you.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.400
- Dad.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.166
- Let me look at you.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.934
- Yeah.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.700
- How you doing?

16:17.767 --> 16:20.800
I mean, about Andrew.

16:20.867 --> 16:23.600
- Well, I miss him,

16:23.667 --> 16:25.533
but, before he got clipped,

16:25.600 --> 16:28.133
we weren't hanging
as much together.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.000
All the freaks he'd be with,

16:30.066 --> 16:32.100
dragging a nigger
from the back of a truck.

16:32.166 --> 16:34.767
What is that shit?

16:35.900 --> 16:37.133
- Well, go on, sit down.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.066
So much I want
to talk to you about.

16:39.133 --> 16:40.600
- You know,
I'd love that,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.834
but, I mean,
I gotta bolt.

16:44.333 --> 16:47.266
- Hank, you just got here.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.133
Hank.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.200
- You know, fuck it.

16:52.266 --> 16:53.667
I got time.

16:53.734 --> 16:57.100
I mean, you're my daddy, right?

17:05.533 --> 17:06.800
- How'd it go?

17:06.867 --> 17:08.734
- Well, it started out
kind of bizarre,

17:08.800 --> 17:11.533
but, Hank eventually
settled down.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.400
- And ScHillinger?

17:13.467 --> 17:14.600
- You know, I've actually
never seen him happy,

17:14.667 --> 17:18.033
but, that's what he seems to be.

17:18.100 --> 17:20.300
He asked Hank to come back,
Hank said yes,

17:20.367 --> 17:23.000
but, whether he shows up
is anybody's guess.

17:23.066 --> 17:25.100
- I'll make sure he does.

17:25.166 --> 17:27.767
- You know,
the most startling thing for me

17:27.834 --> 17:31.200
is how much ScHillinger
truly loves this kid.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.266
- Father?
- Yeah?

17:34.333 --> 17:37.400
- Have you ever loved
anybody too much?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.934
Of course, you're not allowed.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.400
I mean, the celibacy thing.

17:44.467 --> 17:46.233
I guess my question is:

17:46.300 --> 17:48.066
Is it wrong

17:48.133 --> 17:51.467
to love somebody too much?

17:51.533 --> 17:55.200
- Well, I guess that depends on
how the love manifests itself.

17:57.400 --> 18:01.367
And the answer
to your first question is...

18:01.433 --> 18:03.233
yes, I have.

18:07.867 --> 18:09.200
- You gotta pity the guy

18:09.266 --> 18:11.867
who had one thing go
wrong in his whole life.

18:11.934 --> 18:15.400
I mean, other than that
one thing that got fucked up,

18:15.467 --> 18:17.467
he led a good,
average life.

18:17.533 --> 18:19.367
But, some incident or other,

18:19.433 --> 18:22.266
some bad decision
or bad behavior

18:22.333 --> 18:24.867
which maybe gained him
a moment of notoriety,

18:24.934 --> 18:27.667
that'll be the headline
in his obit when he dies.

18:27.734 --> 18:29.667
You know,
like Charles Van Doren,

18:29.734 --> 18:31.000
quiz show scandal.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.800
No matter what else he's done,

18:32.867 --> 18:34.500
that's how he'll be remembered

18:34.567 --> 18:36.867
forever and ever.

18:45.367 --> 18:46.467
Sorry.

18:53.834 --> 18:56.033
She yours?
- My girlfriend.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.200
- Oh, yeah?

18:57.266 --> 18:59.266
My wife.

19:06.967 --> 19:08.433
Mmm.

19:10.633 --> 19:12.567
The lieutenant
wants an update.

19:12.633 --> 19:16.166
He wants to know when
he's gonna see some arrests.

19:22.300 --> 19:23.900
- The shooting
has brought everything

19:23.967 --> 19:26.767
to a complete standstill.

19:26.834 --> 19:30.467
Two of the guys on my initial
drug connection got killed.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.467
- Take it slow, partner.

19:37.867 --> 19:40.467
- I know.
I know.

19:40.533 --> 19:42.166
But, I gotta tell you,

19:42.233 --> 19:44.133
I don't want to spend
any more time in this place

19:44.200 --> 19:46.266
than I have to.

19:57.533 --> 20:00.200
- I miss my wife constantly.

20:03.900 --> 20:06.300
And lately, I...

20:06.367 --> 20:09.200
feel like I'm losing her.

20:09.266 --> 20:11.667
- Think she's sleeping
with another guy?

20:11.734 --> 20:13.133
- No.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.600
I'm just becoming,

20:15.667 --> 20:18.000
you know,
less and less important to her.

20:18.066 --> 20:21.200
She filling in the space
that I left.

20:21.266 --> 20:23.266
- That could never happen
to Kina and me.

20:23.333 --> 20:24.700
- No?

20:24.767 --> 20:26.800
- No.

20:26.867 --> 20:28.767
- Yeah, we'll see.

20:30.166 --> 20:31.934
- Where she from?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.867
- D.C.

20:33.934 --> 20:35.333
- Really?

20:35.400 --> 20:37.133
- Why?

20:37.200 --> 20:39.166
- No, she just--
she looked familiar to me.

20:39.233 --> 20:42.333
I was trying to figure out
from where.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.700
How long she been in the city?

20:43.767 --> 20:46.867
- Six month or so.
- Oh.

20:46.934 --> 20:48.433
I definitely don't know her.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.633
All right, man, a'ight!

20:52.700 --> 20:55.233
- Hey, Kina.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.767
Did you ever have any run-ins
with a guy named Augustus Hill?

21:02.333 --> 21:03.567
Yeah, I thought so.

21:03.633 --> 21:05.367
He says he recognized you.

21:05.433 --> 21:07.333
Well, I think to be safe,

21:07.400 --> 21:10.200
you shouldn't come visit
for a while.

21:10.266 --> 21:11.800
Mm-hmm.

21:18.767 --> 21:21.100
- You know, in Jamaica,
I worked the line.

21:21.166 --> 21:22.567
Yeah?

21:22.633 --> 21:25.367
- Maybe you have a place for me.

21:25.433 --> 21:28.967
- So many of your men
were killed.

21:32.834 --> 21:35.667
- Let me speak to some people.

22:01.834 --> 22:03.767
- Mr. Adebisi.

22:03.834 --> 22:07.000
- Nice island, Jamaica.

22:07.066 --> 22:10.133
- You've been?

22:10.200 --> 22:12.900
- I ask the questions.

22:12.967 --> 22:15.200
- Understood.

22:15.266 --> 22:17.633
- How's Juni Numba doing?

22:17.700 --> 22:19.100
- I know who he is,

22:19.166 --> 22:20.734
but, we have never
danced together.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.500
- Marcus Surrey?

22:22.567 --> 22:25.433
- Again, I know of him.

22:25.500 --> 22:28.333
- William Pouches?

22:28.400 --> 22:31.967
- Him I don't know at all.

22:32.033 --> 22:35.667
- That's because I made him up.

22:35.734 --> 22:38.567
You know Harlem King?

22:38.633 --> 22:41.300
- Barely.

22:41.367 --> 22:43.033
- Then who do you know?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.867
Who can vouch for you?

22:44.934 --> 22:47.633
- Nester Parks.

22:48.834 --> 22:51.567
- Nester Parks?

22:53.333 --> 22:55.433
He's in Lardner.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.066
- Servin' 15 years.

22:58.133 --> 23:00.600
- You can go now.

23:00.667 --> 23:02.633
- Give me a chance
to prove myself.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.934
- Go.

23:12.066 --> 23:14.233
- Poet...

23:14.300 --> 23:16.333
contact Nester Parks.

23:16.400 --> 23:20.300
I want to hear stories
about our new monkey.

23:22.066 --> 23:24.300
- So, the trial starts today.

23:24.367 --> 23:26.000
- Yes.

23:26.066 --> 23:28.967
And I plan to go to court
and be there every day

23:29.033 --> 23:30.400
until we get justice.

23:30.467 --> 23:33.767
- Oh, and you're certain
that we will get justice.

23:33.834 --> 23:36.166
- I have a very good feeling
about this.

23:36.233 --> 23:38.033
I think we're gonna win.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.967
I think the state
and this prison and Devlin

23:41.033 --> 23:43.166
are gonna have to finally
face the facts

23:43.233 --> 23:44.500
that after all these years,

23:44.567 --> 23:46.633
they were responsible
for the riot.

23:46.700 --> 23:48.000
Well, they were responsible,

23:48.066 --> 23:50.233
for all the inmates
who were injured,

23:50.300 --> 23:52.133
and the men,

23:52.200 --> 23:54.100
like my brother, who died.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.233
- You're laughing at me?

23:57.300 --> 23:59.834
- No, I'm not laughing at you.

23:59.900 --> 24:02.533
I just remember the frightened
little girl that you were,

24:02.600 --> 24:04.734
and I'm stunned.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.834
And very pleased,

24:08.900 --> 24:12.200
at all the changes within you.

24:12.266 --> 24:15.133
I wanna kiss you.

24:21.367 --> 24:23.400
- I wish we could.

24:23.467 --> 24:25.433
- You know what?

24:25.500 --> 24:28.600
Everything that
I respect about you,

24:28.667 --> 24:32.200
also really pisses me off.

24:40.700 --> 24:42.133
- Okay.

24:42.200 --> 24:44.967
I've asked you all here today
because as co-plaintiffs,

24:45.033 --> 24:46.767
I want to give you an update

24:46.834 --> 24:48.433
on the lawsuit
against the state.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.834
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.233
We saw that on the news.

24:51.300 --> 24:53.567
When do we get
our fucking money?

24:53.633 --> 24:57.700
- As I have said, O'Reily,
this is not about money.

24:57.767 --> 24:59.767
This is about the state
admitting culpability

24:59.834 --> 25:01.266
in the riot.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.834
- Excuse me,
will each of us be testifying?

25:03.900 --> 25:05.433
- I doubt it.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.367
I have all of your depositions

25:07.433 --> 25:09.200
and our lawyer, Arnie Zelman,

25:09.266 --> 25:10.900
he believes that
only one of us is necessary

25:10.967 --> 25:12.400
to plead our case in court.

25:12.467 --> 25:15.033
- And that someone would be you.

25:15.100 --> 25:16.367
- Yes.

25:16.433 --> 25:18.233
I leave in an hour.

25:18.300 --> 25:21.200
- It's taken all these months
for the trial to start.

25:21.266 --> 25:23.734
How long before the jury
reaches a verdict?

25:23.800 --> 25:25.800
- I would say about a week.

25:25.867 --> 25:27.900
- Well,
aren't we feeling optimistic?

25:27.967 --> 25:29.266
- Well,
given the fact that I believe

25:29.333 --> 25:32.200
the American legal system
to be inherently corrupt,

25:32.266 --> 25:35.433
unfair, chaotic.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.266
Oh, yes,

25:37.333 --> 25:39.367
I'm feeling very optimistic.

25:47.433 --> 25:48.867
Take it away.
- Kareem.

25:48.934 --> 25:50.467
- No, I absolutely refuse.

25:50.533 --> 25:52.400
- Kareem, it's a new
statewide requirement.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.967
Whenever a prisoner
leaves a facility,

25:54.033 --> 25:55.834
he or she must put on
an orange jumpsuit.

25:55.900 --> 25:57.033
- And if I wear that
in the court,

25:57.100 --> 25:59.066
how do you think
the jury will see me?

25:59.133 --> 26:00.800
They will see me as a criminal,

26:00.867 --> 26:02.700
and that is someone
who is not to be believed.

26:02.767 --> 26:04.867
- You can't leave Oz without it.

26:04.934 --> 26:07.266
- Go to the Board of Prisons.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.000
You get me a waiver.
- I tried.

26:10.066 --> 26:11.900
- Then you sue
the Board of Prisons.

26:11.967 --> 26:14.200
- Fine, and maybe Judge Dolloff
will delay the proceedings,

26:14.266 --> 26:15.633
or maybe he won't.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.533
In any case, the legal haggling
is going to eat up time.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.433
I thought you wanted this trial
over as soon as possible.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.700
- You know what I want?

26:20.767 --> 26:24.433
I want this trial done right.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.867
- Okay.

26:25.934 --> 26:28.200
I'll file the proper motions.

26:39.467 --> 26:41.500
- Hey.

26:41.567 --> 26:44.533
- Hey.
- Back so soon?

26:44.600 --> 26:46.734
- Yeah.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.367
There was a complication.

26:48.433 --> 26:50.133
- There always is with you.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.000
- What'd you mean by that?

26:52.066 --> 26:54.700
- Well, you say you're not
in this for the money,

26:54.767 --> 26:56.867
and I believe that.

26:56.934 --> 26:58.934
You say you are in it
for justice.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.467
I think there's
something else involved.

27:02.533 --> 27:05.500
I think you want
this case to fail.

27:05.567 --> 27:08.400
If the jury rejects our lawsuit,

27:08.467 --> 27:11.300
then you'll be able to point
with righteous indignation

27:11.367 --> 27:13.166
at a system that doesn't work.

27:13.233 --> 27:16.667
But, if we succeed,
then what do you have?

27:16.734 --> 27:19.100
What can you rage against?

27:19.166 --> 27:21.066
So, you'll do anything

27:21.133 --> 27:23.900
to find a complication.

27:23.967 --> 27:25.633
- I will not be made a slave too

27:25.700 --> 27:28.100
by the laws of this state,
Beecher.

27:28.166 --> 27:32.333
- Yeah, well, that's where
you and I are different,

27:32.400 --> 27:34.333
'cause I love the law.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.433
Even though it didn't work
in my favor

27:36.500 --> 27:38.567
and I ended up in here,

27:38.633 --> 27:41.133
I thank God every night
for the laws we have.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.400
'cause it keeps people
like Adebisi

27:43.467 --> 27:47.433
and Hernandez and ScHillinger
away from my children.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.500
You know what?

27:49.567 --> 27:52.767
I'm gonna tell Zelman that,
if he needs me to,

27:52.834 --> 27:55.467
I'm gonna testify
instead of you.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.967
- Beecher!
- Beecher's testimony

28:02.033 --> 28:04.600
about physical abuse
by guards at Oswald

28:04.667 --> 28:07.000
before and after the riot
stunned the jury.

28:07.066 --> 28:10.500
- Beecher?
How does Beecher know this?

28:10.567 --> 28:12.500
- Beecher claims that even after

28:12.567 --> 28:14.333
the SORT team
had gained control,

28:14.400 --> 28:15.867
prisoners were tortured.

28:15.934 --> 28:18.667
This is Kevin Gurston reporting
from the courthouse.

28:40.633 --> 28:41.667
- You Mrs. Lazarus?

28:41.734 --> 28:43.166
- Yes.

28:43.233 --> 28:45.934
- I got word somebody
was waiting to see me.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.100
I'm sorry, do I know you?

28:47.166 --> 28:49.967
- No.
Yes.

28:50.033 --> 28:52.567
I was one of the jurors
at your trial.

28:52.633 --> 28:54.133
- Oh.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.500
You came to make sure
I was being punished?

28:55.567 --> 28:57.967
- No, I...

28:58.033 --> 28:59.533
there is something
that has been haunting me

28:59.600 --> 29:01.333
ever since you were convicted.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.767
- What?
You think I'm innocent?

29:02.834 --> 29:04.800
- Oh, I know you're guilty.

29:04.867 --> 29:06.734
I know you killed that young man
and cut off his head

29:06.800 --> 29:08.800
and tried to ship it
Airborne Express.

29:08.867 --> 29:11.834
That is what makes
this whole thing so hard.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.633
I am a Christian.
I know the difference

29:14.700 --> 29:16.266
between what is God's will
and what isn't.

29:16.333 --> 29:18.066
I know that everyone is owed
a fair trial

29:18.133 --> 29:20.066
and that means being judged
without prejudice.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.066
- Lady, what are you
jabbering about?

29:22.133 --> 29:24.600
- At your trial,
you were not judged

29:24.667 --> 29:26.233
without prejudice.

29:26.300 --> 29:29.467
- So, then Mrs. Lazarus says
after the jury got sequestered,

29:29.533 --> 29:32.834
one of the other jurors,
a redneck motherfucker,

29:32.900 --> 29:35.066
announced to everybody,

29:35.133 --> 29:36.633
"This shouldn't take long.

29:36.700 --> 29:39.000
This guy's a fag.
All fags should be dead."

29:39.066 --> 29:40.567
Then he proceeds
to bully the rest of them,

29:40.633 --> 29:42.967
accusing anyone
who wanted to discuss my case

29:43.033 --> 29:45.467
of being a fag.

29:45.533 --> 29:48.000
Mrs. Lazarus says this juror
got 'em all to vote guilty

29:48.066 --> 29:49.734
based solely on the fact
that I'm gay.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.100
- Jesus.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.667
- What are you gonna do?
- I figure I got a shot

29:53.734 --> 29:57.033
at getting the guilty verdict
overturned.

29:57.100 --> 30:00.233
Maybe get a new trial.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.166
Maybe get the fuck outta here.

30:09.967 --> 30:13.300
- Minister Said,

30:13.367 --> 30:16.533
may we talk?

30:16.600 --> 30:18.266
- What is it that you and I
could possibly have

30:18.333 --> 30:19.900
to talk about?

30:19.967 --> 30:22.166
- Oh, you mean 'cause I'm queer

30:22.233 --> 30:27.166
and you Muslims consider
homosexuality an abomination?

30:27.233 --> 30:28.166
- Yes.

30:28.233 --> 30:31.333
There you have it.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.967
- Would you say you're
prejudiced against me?

30:35.033 --> 30:37.100
- No.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.667
I pray every day

30:40.734 --> 30:43.633
for your kind
to find their way to God.

30:43.700 --> 30:46.834
- Seems to me that makes you
all the more prejudiced.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.900
I mean, I'm not going
around asking Allah

30:48.967 --> 30:51.934
to turn you into a faggot.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.900
What is it that you want?

30:59.967 --> 31:01.934
- Justice.

31:31.900 --> 31:34.533
- Shirley Bellinger's execution
has been set

31:34.600 --> 31:37.700
for two weeks from Thursday.

31:37.767 --> 31:41.066
Now execution brings us
a lot of undue attention

31:41.133 --> 31:43.133
from the media,
from protesters.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.300
Shirley is the first woman
to be executed in this state

31:46.367 --> 31:47.867
since 18-something or other,

31:47.934 --> 31:51.333
so, we're gonna eat
more shit than usual.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.800
- Warden?
- Yeah, Lopresti?

31:53.867 --> 31:56.600
If you're gonna have
TV cameras up in death row,

31:56.667 --> 32:00.600
you might wanna think
about having the place painted.

32:00.667 --> 32:03.066
- Okay, all right,
I'll put somebody on it.

32:03.133 --> 32:05.133
Anything else?

32:12.734 --> 32:16.300
- Shirley.

32:16.367 --> 32:18.867
- Good morning,
Officer Lopresti.

32:18.934 --> 32:20.867
And who is this fine gentleman?

32:20.934 --> 32:22.066
- Ralph Galino.

32:22.133 --> 32:23.367
He's gonna paint your cell.

32:23.433 --> 32:24.934
- How do you do?

32:25.000 --> 32:26.834
- Well, the truth be told,
I'm a little pissed off.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.867
On the outside,
I was a contractor.

32:28.934 --> 32:31.467
Housing complex I built
collapsed, killed two people,

32:31.533 --> 32:33.367
but, it wasn't my fault.

32:33.433 --> 32:34.934
I used to supervise painters.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.400
I never painted.

32:37.467 --> 32:39.567
Somehow the warden decided
I was qualified.

32:39.633 --> 32:41.333
- Enough yapping,
Get to work.

32:41.400 --> 32:42.433
Shirley, you can step out.

32:42.500 --> 32:45.400
- Step out?
- Yeah.

32:45.467 --> 32:47.233
Warden decided you're free
to roam around here

32:47.300 --> 32:48.633
'til Galino's done.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.734
- Tell Mr. Glynn
I'm much obliged.

32:53.066 --> 32:54.367
Excuse me.

32:54.433 --> 32:56.767
Sorry, I'm so sorry.
- No problem.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.400
- How are you today, Nat?

32:59.467 --> 33:01.600
- Just fine, honey lamb.

33:01.667 --> 33:03.033
- What are you working on?

33:03.100 --> 33:04.467
- New dress.

33:04.533 --> 33:06.233
- Fucking girlie queer bait.

33:06.300 --> 33:08.834
- Oh, that pierces me
to the very bone.

33:08.900 --> 33:10.400
Especially coming
from a jizzball

33:10.467 --> 33:11.667
who murdered his family.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.433
- You murdered your family?

33:23.500 --> 33:24.700
- Twice.

33:33.700 --> 33:35.967
- Prisoner number
97m573,

33:36.033 --> 33:37.533
Mark Miles.

33:37.600 --> 33:40.300
Convicted
July 10th, 1997,

33:40.367 --> 33:42.433
three counts of murder
in the first degree.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.200
Sentence: death.

33:44.266 --> 33:47.033
- You murdered
two of your families?

33:47.100 --> 33:50.600
My, my, that makes me feel
like a downright amateur.

33:51.900 --> 33:55.900
- 20 years ago,
I shot my wife and my son.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.066
I pleaded insanity,
served 10 years

33:58.133 --> 34:00.000
in the Conley Institute.

34:00.066 --> 34:01.500
I was cured.

34:01.567 --> 34:03.233
- Fucking psychopath.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.300
- Well, that's the pot calling
the kettle black, boy.

34:05.367 --> 34:06.467
- Hey,
don't fucking call me boy.

34:06.533 --> 34:08.734
- Gentlemen, please,
no ruckus.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.900
At least wait
'til I'm dead.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.533
- They set the date yet?

34:13.600 --> 34:16.400
- Two weeks.

34:16.467 --> 34:18.066
- That don't fuck
with your head?

34:18.133 --> 34:19.867
- No.

34:19.934 --> 34:22.834
After all the bullshit,
the trial, the appeals,

34:22.900 --> 34:26.900
the miscarriage,
I'm ready to go.

34:26.967 --> 34:30.066
I am ready
to meet my maker.

34:30.133 --> 34:31.967
'Course whether he's ready
for the likes of me

34:32.033 --> 34:35.333
is another story.

34:37.734 --> 34:41.767
- When you smile,
you are a very attractive man.

34:42.633 --> 34:44.300
- For a nigga?

34:45.633 --> 34:49.133
- I admit I've had
my prejudices,

34:49.200 --> 34:52.133
but now that I am so
close to the end,

34:52.200 --> 34:56.200
I see that all of us
is the same.

34:56.266 --> 34:58.734
Same needs,

34:58.800 --> 35:00.600
same desires.

35:00.667 --> 35:02.734
- Yo, Lopresti!
- Hey, hey, hey!

35:02.800 --> 35:04.800
What's going on here?

35:04.867 --> 35:07.000
- Just a little
fraternization.

35:07.066 --> 35:09.233
- That is not on
the goddamn program.

35:09.300 --> 35:12.633
- Done.
- Good, get inside.

35:14.834 --> 35:16.867
- Careful of the fumes,
you might get high.

35:16.934 --> 35:19.233
- I'm looking forward to it.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.767
- Hey.

35:22.834 --> 35:24.567
- Hey, Pete, I was just
gonna come find you.

35:24.633 --> 35:26.533
- Oh, yeah?

35:26.600 --> 35:29.633
- I had dinner last night
with Preston's parents.

35:29.700 --> 35:32.033
It's been awhile
since I'd seen them.

35:32.100 --> 35:35.333
Anyway, I mentioned
your interaction program.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.567
- Really?

35:37.633 --> 35:38.967
How'd they react?

35:39.033 --> 35:42.800
- Patricia seemed more intrigued
by the idea than Lars.

35:42.867 --> 35:46.066
- Would you like me
to call them?

35:46.133 --> 35:49.400
- Nope. I convinced them
to participate.

35:49.467 --> 35:51.767
- You?

35:51.834 --> 35:55.467
- I always had a really good
relationship with them,

35:55.533 --> 35:59.767
you know, even though Preston
married outside of his religion,

35:59.834 --> 36:02.033
outside his tribe.

36:02.100 --> 36:04.834
It's funny, during dinner
Patricia kept saying,

36:04.900 --> 36:07.834
"it's not like
we blame you, Gloria."

36:07.900 --> 36:09.633
Which of course means
that they do blame me

36:09.700 --> 36:11.834
for Preston's death,

36:11.900 --> 36:14.300
only they're too wasp
to be confrontational.

36:17.900 --> 36:20.600
And then I realized
that I blame myself, too.

36:28.734 --> 36:32.266
- Cyril, stop that,
put that down.

36:32.333 --> 36:35.033
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

36:35.100 --> 36:38.367
Cyril, you do understand
that you may have to talk

36:38.433 --> 36:42.233
to the mother and father
and wife of the man you killed?

36:42.300 --> 36:44.633
- Yes.

36:44.700 --> 36:47.633
Dr. Nathan.

36:47.700 --> 36:50.533
I like her.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.767
- When you meet them,

36:52.834 --> 36:55.266
do you know what
you might want to say?

36:56.667 --> 36:58.033
- Um...

36:58.100 --> 37:02.333
that--that I wanna be
their friend.

37:06.233 --> 37:08.700
- Uh, Ryan, how about you?

37:08.767 --> 37:11.133
What do you want to say?
- Hey, we're not here for me.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.600
We're here to cure him
of those nightmares.

37:13.667 --> 37:16.467
- No, no, no.
We're here to help you, too.

37:16.533 --> 37:19.266
I think you might
want to talk about

37:19.333 --> 37:21.834
getting diagnosed
for breast cancer,

37:21.900 --> 37:24.033
about how
frightening that was,

37:24.100 --> 37:26.300
how kind Gloria was,

37:26.367 --> 37:28.266
and how you developed
feelings for her,

37:28.333 --> 37:30.033
and how that led to you

37:30.100 --> 37:31.967
having Cyril murder Preston.

37:35.667 --> 37:38.767
- I still love her,
I do.

37:38.834 --> 37:41.767
And that ain't never
gonna go away.

37:53.300 --> 37:55.633
Oh, fuck!

38:03.867 --> 38:06.233
- I don't understand
why it's still bleeding.

38:06.300 --> 38:08.000
- Maybe Dr. Nathan
should take a look at it.

38:08.066 --> 38:09.200
What do you say?

38:09.266 --> 38:11.667
- Well, Dr. Nathan's
gone for a few hours.

38:11.734 --> 38:12.967
- What?

38:13.033 --> 38:15.066
- I think I'll see if
I can find Dr. Stopnik.

38:16.467 --> 38:18.266
- Oh, fuck.

38:19.567 --> 38:21.767
- Sister Peter Marie,

38:21.834 --> 38:23.633
I'd like you to meet
Lars and Patricia Nathan.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.767
- Hello.
Welcome.

38:25.834 --> 38:27.500
- Thank you.

38:27.567 --> 38:29.033
- Weren't you at
Preston's funeral?

38:29.100 --> 38:31.467
- Yes, we spoke very briefly.

38:31.533 --> 38:32.900
I wasn't sure
if you'd remember.

38:32.967 --> 38:35.567
- I remember everything
about that day.

38:35.633 --> 38:38.166
- Why don't we all sit down?

38:43.467 --> 38:45.767
- When Gloria asked us
about coming here,

38:45.834 --> 38:48.333
I have to admit
I was skeptical.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.467
I'm not sure what
good it'll do

38:50.533 --> 38:53.233
bringing up all
those feelings again.

38:53.300 --> 38:55.100
- The bottom line, Lars,

38:55.166 --> 38:57.100
is that by facing
the men responsible

38:57.166 --> 38:59.033
for your son's death,

38:59.100 --> 39:01.333
you have the opportunity
to express things

39:01.400 --> 39:03.700
you might not
otherwise get to say.

39:03.767 --> 39:04.967
- That's what I told him.

39:05.033 --> 39:08.033
- Right, so,
from now until then,

39:08.100 --> 39:09.934
we'll have a series
of conversations to help

39:10.000 --> 39:12.767
prepare you for meeting
the O'Reilly brothers.

39:12.834 --> 39:15.867
Now, at times the process
might seem slow,

39:15.934 --> 39:19.867
frustrating,
even counterproductive.

39:19.934 --> 39:22.033
- We can drop out at any time.

39:22.100 --> 39:24.333
- Yes, but, ultimately,

39:24.400 --> 39:27.433
the experience
can be very satisfying.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.767
- Let's get started.

39:33.834 --> 39:35.433
- What's the single
most important thing

39:35.500 --> 39:37.734
you want to ask
Cyril and Ryan?

39:44.367 --> 39:48.033
- Why did you
murder my baby?

39:56.800 --> 39:57.800
- Hey.

39:57.867 --> 39:59.467
- Ryan?
- Yo.

39:59.533 --> 40:01.333
- Why do you use
the pay phone?

40:01.400 --> 40:04.734
- To call out, Cyril,
that's why.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.667
- Why not use
your cell thing?

40:06.734 --> 40:08.500
- You mean a cell phone?

40:08.567 --> 40:09.767
Because they're illegal in Oz.

40:09.834 --> 40:11.533
They're against the rules.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.333
- Hmm.

40:13.400 --> 40:16.967
Then why does the man
who talks funny have one?

40:17.033 --> 40:18.567
- What man who talks funny?

40:18.633 --> 40:22.467
Everyone in this shit hole
talks funny, Cyril.

40:22.533 --> 40:24.667
- Him.

40:31.433 --> 40:33.333
- Stanislofsky's
got a cell phone?

40:33.400 --> 40:35.233
- I saw him
talking on it.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.400
- Really?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.900
Fuck.

40:40.967 --> 40:44.066
- You wait here, okay?
I'll be right back.

40:53.500 --> 40:56.800
Nikolai, Nikolai,
Nikolai...

40:56.867 --> 40:58.734
How's it hanging
there, buddy?

40:58.800 --> 41:01.567
- O'Reilly, always
a pleasure to see you.

41:01.633 --> 41:03.533
- Yeah, right.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.633
You know, a little birdy
told me a secret about you

41:05.700 --> 41:09.033
and I just came by to see
if it was true or not.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.033
You got a cell phone?

41:11.100 --> 41:12.934
- No.

41:13.000 --> 41:13.967
- Hmm.

41:14.033 --> 41:15.133
Well, I guess
that's what I get

41:15.200 --> 41:17.166
for listening to
little birdies, huh?

41:17.233 --> 41:18.967
Because if you did
have a cell phone,

41:19.033 --> 41:23.033
you'd let me borrow it.
You'd share, right?

41:23.100 --> 41:25.033
- Share?
- Yeah.

41:25.100 --> 41:28.066
- Mmm, rent maybe,

41:28.133 --> 41:31.233
if I had one,
which I don't.

41:31.300 --> 41:34.400
- I know.
You told me and I believe you,

41:34.467 --> 41:37.767
because that's just the kind
of trust that we have.

41:37.834 --> 41:40.000
- Yes.

41:40.066 --> 41:41.667
Absolutely.

41:41.734 --> 41:46.467
- Well, I'm sorry
to disturb you.

41:46.533 --> 41:48.233
- Not a problem.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.667
- Bye, Nikolai.

41:57.300 --> 42:00.400
There you go, Niko,
eat hearty.

42:03.266 --> 42:05.233
Yo, Pancamo,

42:05.300 --> 42:07.900
my brother's sick, I gotta
get him back to Em City.

42:07.967 --> 42:09.300
- We're in the middle
of fucking lunch.

42:09.367 --> 42:10.767
- Look, I don't get him
back to Em City now,

42:10.834 --> 42:13.333
he's gonna blow chunks into
that salad bowl right there.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.000
- Okay, okay, go,
get him out of here.

42:15.066 --> 42:16.800
- Cyril, you all right?
Come on.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.000
You feeling alright?
Come on, let's go.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.567
You all right?

42:31.500 --> 42:33.300
- But I feel good,
Ryan.

42:33.367 --> 42:35.500
- Oh, shut up.

42:35.567 --> 42:37.800
Stand here and tell
me if you see Stanislofsky

42:37.867 --> 42:39.433
coming, okay?

42:51.800 --> 42:53.433
Fuck.

42:54.500 --> 42:57.400
Where's the fucking phone?

43:08.000 --> 43:10.133
- Couldn't find it,
could you?

43:10.200 --> 43:12.367
- Find what?

43:12.433 --> 43:13.533
- The cell phone.

43:13.600 --> 43:14.834
- Cell phone?

43:14.900 --> 43:16.266
I thought you said
you had no cell phone.

43:16.333 --> 43:17.867
- I don't.

43:17.934 --> 43:19.133
- Well, then how could I
look for something

43:19.200 --> 43:21.533
that doesn't exist?

43:21.600 --> 43:24.166
- Exactly.

43:42.100 --> 43:43.834
What's up, jizz?
- Fuck you.

43:46.333 --> 43:47.900
- Hey, Ralph.
- What do you want?

43:47.967 --> 43:50.333
- Jesus, can't a guy
just be friendly?

43:50.400 --> 43:52.533
- I been here for days
and you ain't been friendly.

43:52.600 --> 43:56.000
- Well, that's why I'm here, to
make up for my lack of manners.

43:56.066 --> 43:57.600
You mind if I sit?

43:59.633 --> 44:02.600
Jesus,
this mattress sucks.

44:02.667 --> 44:05.033
Hard adjusting to
life in Oz, isn't it?

44:05.100 --> 44:07.467
Especially with
that jizz-bag roommate of yours.

44:07.533 --> 44:09.000
- Hoyt. Hoyt is a pig.
I don't even know why

44:09.066 --> 44:12.000
they moved me in here
after that French guy died.

44:12.066 --> 44:14.033
- You know what
the hardest part is?

44:14.100 --> 44:15.233
It's getting used to life

44:15.300 --> 44:17.333
without all the trimmings,
you know?

44:17.400 --> 44:21.467
I'm talking about sex,
a good cigar.

44:21.533 --> 44:23.200
- Oh.
- Yeah, a fine bottle

44:23.266 --> 44:25.367
of vino, a cell phone.

44:25.433 --> 44:27.867
- I didn't know that
cell phones weren't allowed.

44:27.934 --> 44:29.667
Stanislofsky set
me straight.

44:29.734 --> 44:31.700
- Yeah?

44:31.767 --> 44:33.133
Ralph, you grow up
in America?

44:33.200 --> 44:34.367
- Yeah.

44:34.433 --> 44:37.033
- Growing up, who was
the one enemy we had?

44:37.100 --> 44:39.900
The one country
that we never trusted?

44:43.567 --> 44:45.400
- Russia.
- Yeah.

44:45.467 --> 44:49.133
And Stanislofsky, he's...

44:49.200 --> 44:51.033
- Russian.
- Right.

44:52.266 --> 44:54.166
He was telling you the truth
about not being allowed cells,

44:54.233 --> 44:55.900
but, instead of
turning yours in,

44:55.967 --> 44:57.200
he kept yours for himself.

44:57.266 --> 44:58.600
- Fucking cocksucker.

44:58.667 --> 45:01.834
- Yeah, if I were you,
I'd go take back what was mine.

45:09.834 --> 45:11.533
- Hey, you fucker,
I want my cell phone back.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.500
- Lower your voice.

45:13.567 --> 45:15.000
Fuck you, I want it.

45:15.066 --> 45:18.633
- You think I carry
the thing around with me?

45:18.700 --> 45:21.000
I have to get it
from the hiding place.

45:21.066 --> 45:22.800
Will take time.

45:22.867 --> 45:24.900
- Okay.

45:24.967 --> 45:28.867
But I want that cell phone
in my hands by lights out.

45:51.066 --> 45:54.100
- Mr. Pancamo, a question.

45:54.166 --> 45:57.200
Ralph Galino,
is he a friend of yours?

45:57.266 --> 46:00.266
- We don't associate.

46:00.333 --> 46:03.066
- So if he were ill

46:03.133 --> 46:07.266
or hurt in an accident?

46:07.333 --> 46:10.100
- I don't care if that
motherfucker lives or dies.

46:28.200 --> 46:30.133
- Excuse me.

46:33.700 --> 46:35.867
- Where the fuck you going?
And don't tell me Cyril's sick.

46:35.934 --> 46:37.467
- No, but, I gotta--
- No, the only thing

46:37.533 --> 46:39.166
you gotta do is
go back to fucking work

46:39.233 --> 46:40.633
or I'll have you and
your brother transferred up

46:40.700 --> 46:41.867
to making ladies'
dresses, okay?

46:41.934 --> 46:43.166
- No, but, I gotta--
- No, no, okay?

46:43.233 --> 46:44.166
Get to fucking work.

46:44.233 --> 46:46.266
- You got yourself a deal.

47:21.433 --> 47:23.800
- Motherfucker!

47:23.867 --> 47:25.900
Fuck!

47:28.633 --> 47:31.333
- You looking for Galino?

47:31.400 --> 47:34.066
He went for
a walk with Hoyt.

47:44.633 --> 47:47.567
- Looks to me like an O.D.

47:47.633 --> 47:49.266
- Let's get him
to the morgue.

47:49.333 --> 47:51.300
- Yeah.

48:01.667 --> 48:04.300
- You played this one well.

48:04.367 --> 48:09.100
You covered all the bases,
kept your hands clean.

48:09.166 --> 48:10.667
No one knows
about the cell phone,

48:10.734 --> 48:12.433
so no one suspects you.

48:12.500 --> 48:14.400
It's nice.

48:14.467 --> 48:16.300
I think I underestimated you,
Nikolai,

48:16.367 --> 48:19.100
and I don't
usually do that.

48:19.166 --> 48:22.333
Listen, we could
drag this thing out,

48:22.400 --> 48:26.300
go to war, but, you know,
eventually I'd win.

48:26.367 --> 48:29.734
So I say let's
just work together,

48:29.800 --> 48:33.533
like Russia and the U.S.,
what was that called again?

48:33.600 --> 48:34.767
- Detente.

48:34.834 --> 48:38.300
- Detente, exactly.

48:38.367 --> 48:40.433
What do you say?

49:09.867 --> 49:11.900
- Miguel.

49:13.967 --> 49:15.633
Miguel?

49:15.700 --> 49:17.100
What happened?

49:17.166 --> 49:18.667
- You're in
the hospital ward.

49:18.734 --> 49:20.633
Do you remember what happened?

49:23.467 --> 49:25.734
You were both stabbed
by William Giles.

49:29.867 --> 49:32.400
Bevilaqua's dead.

49:34.467 --> 49:37.967
- You know, I promised myself
I'd never get stuck again,

49:38.033 --> 49:40.867
and that little freak
Giles gets me.

49:44.734 --> 49:46.333
What's with these?

49:46.400 --> 49:48.767
- Standard procedure
for anyone from Solitary.

50:00.567 --> 50:02.633
- Chico, chico, chico.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.400
Man, you fucking
disappoint me.

50:04.467 --> 50:06.333
- Why, El Cid?

50:06.400 --> 50:08.734
- I asked you
to kill Miguel Alvarez.

50:08.800 --> 50:09.800
Is he dead?

50:09.867 --> 50:11.200
- No.

50:11.266 --> 50:13.166
- I don't like that word, no.

50:13.233 --> 50:16.133
- Carlos Martinez is
in the bed next to Alvarez,

50:16.200 --> 50:18.000
but he's having trouble
getting a weapon, man.

50:18.066 --> 50:20.633
- I don't give a fuck if his
mother's in bed next to him,

50:20.700 --> 50:24.333
get the fucking job done or
I find me another lieutenant.

50:24.400 --> 50:27.200
Get the fuck
out of my face, now.

50:54.500 --> 50:57.133
- You having fun?

50:57.200 --> 50:58.433
- Hey.

50:58.500 --> 51:00.200
How you doing there,
Alvarez?

51:00.266 --> 51:02.066
I heard what happened.

51:02.133 --> 51:04.000
- How's Emerald City doing?

51:04.066 --> 51:05.066
- Scary.

51:05.133 --> 51:06.800
I'm in constant fear.

51:06.867 --> 51:10.000
- Well, what are you gonna do?

51:10.066 --> 51:11.200
- Dig.

51:11.266 --> 51:14.433
- What?

51:14.500 --> 51:15.967
- Dig.

51:16.033 --> 51:17.500
- You're digging
another tunnel?

51:17.567 --> 51:19.266
- Shh.

51:19.333 --> 51:21.500
I'm almost done.

51:21.567 --> 51:23.266
- You're a crazy fuck.

51:23.333 --> 51:25.066
- You say that tomorrow,

51:25.133 --> 51:28.133
you'll be saying it
to my backside.

52:05.800 --> 52:09.934
- Prisoner number 98M232,
Carlos Martinez,

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
convicted
October 6, 1998,

52:13.066 --> 52:15.467
two counts murder
in the first degree.

52:15.533 --> 52:18.633
Sentence: life without
the possibility of parole.

52:43.033 --> 52:45.266
- Whoa!
Fuck!

52:45.333 --> 52:48.266
Help! Help!

52:48.333 --> 52:49.934
- Put it down, Martinez!

52:50.033 --> 52:52.333
There's no way out,
so put the shank down now!

52:52.400 --> 52:55.000
- Fuck you, bitch!

52:55.066 --> 52:57.734
- Down, motherfucker.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.700
- Shit, shit.

53:11.967 --> 53:13.500
- Count.

53:13.567 --> 53:15.333
- 88K214.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.133
95H522.

53:17.200 --> 53:19.133
96G415.

53:19.200 --> 53:21.033
98T304.

53:21.100 --> 53:23.100
65R814.

53:23.166 --> 53:24.767
98B242.

53:25.867 --> 53:27.800
98B242!

53:29.000 --> 53:30.266
- Where is he, Rebadow?

53:30.333 --> 53:31.600
- I don't know.

53:31.667 --> 53:32.800
- Don't bullshit me.

53:32.867 --> 53:34.166
You guys are joined
at the brain.

53:34.233 --> 53:35.433
Where's Busmalis?

53:35.500 --> 53:38.600
- I really have no idea.

53:38.667 --> 53:40.934
- Check the log.
Where was he last?

53:42.133 --> 53:44.867
- On work detail
mopping the hospital.

53:44.934 --> 53:46.000
- I'll go check.

54:23.433 --> 54:27.400
Oh, great.
Just great!

54:27.467 --> 54:29.433
Central, this is 214.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.900
We got a 69, hospital unit.

54:31.967 --> 54:34.000
- Roger, copy that. Over.

54:55.233 --> 54:56.700
- Ultimately I guess it
don't matter

54:56.767 --> 54:58.567
what they write
in your obituary

54:58.633 --> 55:01.166
'cause you ain't gonna
be around to read it.

55:01.233 --> 55:04.900
Newsprint fades,
paper turns to pulp.

55:04.967 --> 55:08.367
The mark you leave behind
has to be deeper.

55:08.433 --> 55:12.000
The mark you leave behind has
to be on another person's soul.
