01:15.708 --> 01:17.699
Forget about him.

01:18.344 --> 01:23.216
And coming here every week

01:23.251 --> 01:25.013
won't change your fate.

01:25.718 --> 01:28.687
If that were the case,
I'd be making a fortune.

01:28.855 --> 01:30.049
But it's not.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.587
Should I tell you again?

01:33.193 --> 01:36.993
You've had a tough life,
and you will.

01:37.197 --> 01:40.598
And you don't stand
a chance with this man.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.337
I wish otherwise,
but it's the truth.

01:44.372 --> 01:47.272
Don't tell me
it's written on my face.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.875
It is.

01:48.910 --> 01:51.742
But you never know.

01:52.178 --> 01:55.909
Then why try to find out?

01:58.852 --> 02:01.218
I'll write you an amulet.

02:01.488 --> 02:06.585
Look at your hair.
When'd you wash it?

02:07.427 --> 02:09.395
Have him carry this.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.386
I can't guarantee anything.

02:11.564 --> 02:14.192
Free of charge.
Take it and leave.

02:20.773 --> 02:21.608
What?

02:21.643 --> 02:23.042
Let me bow to you.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.703
You don't need to.

02:25.011 --> 02:26.513
To show my gratitude.

02:26.548 --> 02:28.548
No, just go.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.015
Thank you.

03:05.885 --> 03:06.977
Way to go, girl.

03:07.453 --> 03:08.977
Keep it up.

03:10.924 --> 03:16.021
I'm so curious.
What are you good at?

03:19.432 --> 03:23.892
<i>Oh, not that.</i>

03:24.270 --> 03:30.732

You'll be amazed.

03:54.435 --> 04:00.464
My bust is 34 inches.
Waist is 24, and hip is 36.

Why is she showering?</i>

What's wrong?

09:19.125 --> 09:21.218
It was a good show.
Thanks.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.028
Tired?

09:26.198 --> 09:28.189
Don't you ever dance.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.037
You almost blew it.

09:33.806 --> 09:38.106
I dance along with you
to make it seem real.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.344
Are you performing?

09:42.882 --> 09:44.975
Wear a sweat shirt.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.316
There isn't any that fits me.

09:52.625 --> 09:53.785
Sang-jun?

09:56.762 --> 09:58.354
Why'd the stage collapse?

09:58.864 --> 10:00.058
Sang-jun?

10:02.535 --> 10:03.627
Good job.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.237
Great job.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.733
You okay?

10:10.977 --> 10:13.468
They built the stage poorly.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.739
I was worried sick.

10:19.318 --> 10:20.080
Okay.

10:28.027 --> 10:32.396
I need to assess the situation.

10:32.598 --> 10:36.796
So he's interested in you?

10:37.770 --> 10:43.333
It's the feeling.
He's very nice to me.

10:43.609 --> 10:45.144
Save it.

10:45.179 --> 10:49.740
There are 3 types of women

They're a treasure.

We're a present.

10:56.455 --> 11:00.755
You? A reject!
Get it now?

11:02.461 --> 11:04.588
Don't eat the fat.

11:05.097 --> 11:09.969
Listen.
I have a woman's intuition.

11:10.004 --> 11:12.995
It's your illusion.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.307
Intuition is from experience.

11:15.342 --> 11:20.540
Have you ever been in love?

11:20.713 --> 11:22.772
<i>- Tell me.
- Have I been in love?</i>

11:22.982 --> 11:27.385
<i>Yes, I have. My first love.</i>

11:29.622 --> 11:30.919
Sweetie?

11:33.993 --> 11:37.451
Did I ask you to buy
diet pills from me?

11:38.497 --> 11:40.021
What am I?

11:41.967 --> 11:46.505
A guy who sells you diet pills
costing 3 grand?

11:46.540 --> 11:48.200
Don't say that.

11:48.441 --> 11:53.779
Your business is slow.
I just wanted to help.

11:53.814 --> 11:57.681
It is.
And you're not helping.

11:58.050 --> 12:03.283
You made me feel
so miserable.

12:03.589 --> 12:05.523
I'm sorry.

12:06.192 --> 12:09.958
I'm warning you.
Don't do it again.

12:10.329 --> 12:11.990
Give pills to Jung-min.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.433
You're as pretty as you are.

12:14.468 --> 12:18.392
Try to lose weight,
and we're through. Okay?

12:20.005 --> 12:22.007
These are checks.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.736
- Okay.
- Endorse them.

12:25.277 --> 12:28.713
Just do the first one.

12:29.081 --> 12:32.915
If you do this again,
we're done.

12:33.385 --> 12:36.377
<i>It was the last of him I saw.</i>

12:36.655 --> 12:40.559
<i>I'm sorry. I don't deserve
a girl like you.</i>

12:40.594 --> 12:46.794
<i>I'll pray for you to meet
someone better than me. Amen.</i>

12:49.268 --> 12:52.431
<i>That day,
I decided not to eat.</i>

12:53.806 --> 12:56.866
<i>And to lose some weight.</i>

13:05.751 --> 13:06.945
Move.

13:07.153 --> 13:10.554
This requires a skill.
Grab that end.

13:10.756 --> 13:12.656
Lift her at the count of 3.

13:12.892 --> 13:15.725
One, two, three.

13:20.065 --> 13:21.225
Lift her.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.767
I said at the count of 3.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.741
You lifted at 2. Hey!

13:28.776 --> 13:29.833
Yes?

13:30.242 --> 13:31.709
Lift at 3, okay?

13:31.844 --> 13:33.712
We need to work together.

13:33.747 --> 13:36.237
Grab it.
At 3, okay?

13:38.117 --> 13:39.641
One, two, three!

13:43.689 --> 13:44.986
Bring that bed.

13:45.691 --> 13:46.919
Put them together.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.419
We'll roll her over.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.020
I'll do it.

14:02.274 --> 14:05.107
Excuse me?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.011
I'll roll over.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.553
Why didn't you wake her?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.385
<i>I learned that night.</i>

14:19.792 --> 14:24.661
<i>I'm not cut out

14:38.911 --> 14:40.902
It's Hakuna Matata.

Africans believe

14:46.585 --> 14:47.386
Oh!

14:47.421 --> 14:48.614
Nicely done.

15:18.484 --> 15:19.485
Are you hung over?

15:19.520 --> 15:21.578
Give it some feelings.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.585
God!

15:25.991 --> 15:28.193
It's a vital part.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.024
Try to feel the rhythm.

15:30.963 --> 15:32.658
It's taking forever.

16:10.936 --> 16:13.200
She's trying hard?

16:13.472 --> 16:15.307
Is trying hard enough?

16:15.342 --> 16:16.865
Everyone does that.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.842
Doing well is what counts.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.411
Like you.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.954
Keep up the good work.

16:28.989 --> 16:32.057
<i>- Chances are slim.
- I believe in you.</i>

16:32.092 --> 16:34.651
<i>Why does my hope get higher?</i>

16:40.699 --> 16:42.929
Thanks for the ride.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.658
You're welcome.

16:45.704 --> 16:48.502
Who are you visiting?

16:48.707 --> 16:54.304
Someone that I love.

17:00.252 --> 17:01.276
Who's he?

17:02.488 --> 17:04.046
Check me out.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.699
Sorry! Bye.

17:17.903 --> 17:23.272
Wait. I'm having a
birthday party tomorrow.

17:24.276 --> 17:25.675
Don't miss it.

17:36.422 --> 17:40.950

17:44.463 --> 17:48.729
Darling, how's Hanna?

17:49.701 --> 17:54.070
I told you.
She's become a singer.

17:54.573 --> 17:57.235
And she's in love.

18:05.217 --> 18:11.918
Darling? Why do you
get heavier by the day?

18:13.692 --> 18:16.286
Let's keep on dancing.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.061
A delivery for you.

19:00.405 --> 19:05.604
"Hanna, I'm so grateful
for your hard work."

19:08.747 --> 19:13.184
"Wear this dress

19:13.418 --> 19:15.409
"HAN Sang-jun" HAN Sang-jun?

19:15.888 --> 19:17.788
It's a dress?

19:21.560 --> 19:24.120
What's this?
A strap on the bus?

19:33.305 --> 19:34.704
I'm not so sure.

19:50.055 --> 19:51.156
Hi!

19:51.191 --> 19:52.282
Hi.

19:54.092 --> 19:55.957
Hanna, sit here.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.020
Come on.
Pass around drinks.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.065
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.035
You could've come around.

20:10.709 --> 20:11.676
Thanks.

20:12.177 --> 20:14.407
Just come!

20:17.216 --> 20:18.513
Thanks.

20:25.424 --> 20:27.551
I got you something.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.859
You shouldn't have.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.632
Oh, I love this.

20:35.867 --> 20:36.856
Thanks.

20:39.271 --> 20:43.071
Take off your coat.
It's so heavy.

20:44.042 --> 20:48.680
Aren't you hot?
Make yourself comfortable.

20:48.715 --> 20:49.669
Yes.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.447
Go ahead.

21:20.979 --> 21:25.609
You sent it.
So I'm wearing it.

21:27.419 --> 21:28.353
Yeah?

21:28.388 --> 21:30.150
Yeah, Hanna.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.451
Wear a dress like
that more often.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.625
I'm totally fine with that.

21:37.896 --> 21:41.093
Right?
I love the design.

21:46.505 --> 21:47.665
She's here.

21:48.006 --> 21:51.533
Is she the Queen?
You don't need to announce her.

21:52.177 --> 21:54.111
Let her in.

22:31.316 --> 22:32.451
Where are you going?

22:32.486 --> 22:33.713
I feel like dancing.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.325
Let her through.

22:45.731 --> 22:47.432
- Hold on.
- What?

22:47.467 --> 22:49.866
They're cleaning.
Use the other restroom.

22:50.469 --> 22:53.097
You're so funny.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.306
How stupid can you get?

22:55.474 --> 22:57.738
I'd never know.

22:58.944 --> 23:01.310
I wanna live with style.

23:04.082 --> 23:06.642
But you're not helping.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.944
That's a problem for me.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.692
Miss backup dancer days?

23:13.727 --> 23:16.490
The bitch gets on my nerves.

23:23.001 --> 23:25.094
If so, you sing.

23:26.304 --> 23:28.898
You think I like her?

23:30.409 --> 23:32.210
You don't have to remind her

23:32.245 --> 23:35.313
what a turnoff she is.

23:35.348 --> 23:37.008
Leave her be.

23:37.282 --> 23:40.479
Be grateful she's come to us.

23:40.652 --> 23:42.779
I'll teach her a lesson.

23:46.057 --> 23:49.652
Give me back the keys
to the house and the car.

23:50.028 --> 23:52.519
Then teach her a lesson.

23:56.568 --> 24:01.437
Why are you crying?
Why?

24:02.541 --> 24:05.476
Hanna is the one to be crying.

24:06.144 --> 24:09.602
She's talented,
but ugly and fat.

24:09.815 --> 24:12.617
You're untalented,
but gorgeous and sexy.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.642
You got it all going.

24:14.853 --> 24:17.287
She exists for you.

24:17.556 --> 24:22.186
Listen.
We're just using her.

24:22.394 --> 24:25.886
Understood?
Be nice to her.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.826
If she walks, it's over.

24:47.953 --> 24:54.449
<i>I couldn't be happier
dreaming about you.</i>

24:56.962 --> 25:04.334
<i>Even if it didn't last long...
Thanks for making me happy.</i>

25:07.906 --> 25:09.897
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

25:17.949 --> 25:20.076
<i>My wife is showering again.</i>

25:21.253 --> 25:24.416
<i>Why can't I die with style?</i>

25:24.689 --> 25:29.319
<i>I'll make love to her,
but it's gonna be hard.</i>

25:29.494 --> 25:31.663
<i>I wanna hear your voice.</i>

25:31.698 --> 25:33.153
<i>Aren't you there?</i>

25:33.365 --> 25:36.960
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>

25:37.369 --> 25:42.170
What a story!
Don't tell me you made it up.

25:45.510 --> 25:48.536
Can you make it happen?

25:48.780 --> 25:50.805
Your willpower can.

25:50.982 --> 25:53.018
All I do is to remove a scar

25:53.053 --> 25:55.213
from your hurt soul.

25:55.787 --> 25:59.245
How much will it cost?

26:01.126 --> 26:03.720
I'm a doctor,
not a businessman.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.030
Is it expensive?

26:07.599 --> 26:13.505
All the things you want done
with 30% discount...

26:13.540 --> 26:17.066
I'll pay you every penny
with interest.

26:17.943 --> 26:19.570
Can I do it on credit?

26:20.946 --> 26:22.814
<i>- Ms. KIM?
- Yes?</i>

26:22.849 --> 26:26.773
Will you show this lady out?

26:27.352 --> 26:28.876
Don't validate parking.

26:31.289 --> 26:35.783
Jesus protects me
How blessed I am

26:36.094 --> 26:39.723
Don't you recognize my voice?

26:39.965 --> 26:44.459
Shall we go
to the injection room?

26:44.869 --> 26:47.736
And tear up stockings?

26:47.973 --> 26:49.372
Right.

26:49.741 --> 26:53.837
Did you make love last night
after she showered?

26:55.380 --> 26:57.315
Who did the eye job
on that patient yesterday?

26:57.350 --> 27:00.452
It was horrible.

27:00.487 --> 27:03.088
And what's up with meals
for patients?

27:03.123 --> 27:05.256
They complained to me.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.883
Get out! Leave!

27:12.964 --> 27:14.625
Who are you?

27:16.301 --> 27:20.635
I know you're a good person.

27:20.939 --> 27:24.397
You've given your wife
a full body makeover.

27:24.576 --> 27:28.535
Now you dread
laying your hands on her.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.478
You must know how I feel.

27:32.117 --> 27:36.213
I've done crazy things
during phone sex.

27:36.421 --> 27:39.447
You say they don't respect
plastic surgeons.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.990
That's because they don't
deal with lives.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.560
I'm doing this
so I can live a life.

27:44.729 --> 27:48.790
Not to satisfy my vanity.

27:49.267 --> 27:54.432
It's the right cause
you've been looking for. Right?

27:54.873 --> 27:57.671
Did you memorize all that?

27:58.309 --> 28:01.176
You could die from all these.

28:04.916 --> 28:07.248
I died yesterday.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.763
Go ahead.

28:25.103 --> 28:28.664
I knew you'd do that
so I made a copy.

28:35.246 --> 28:36.781
You'll put it on the net?

28:36.816 --> 28:38.578
You can't blackmail me!

28:46.825 --> 28:49.316
My life is in your hands.

28:50.295 --> 28:54.254
You can end it.
Or save it.

29:01.139 --> 29:05.940
<i>- Yes?
- Get me my operation schedule.</i>

29:11.316 --> 29:12.681
These eyes.

29:13.017 --> 29:14.245
What about a nose?

29:15.019 --> 29:17.146
Okay, this.
Without a mole.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.390
Pick the face shape

29:19.425 --> 29:21.688
from these actresses.
Which one?

29:22.327 --> 29:23.259
Kate Moss!

29:29.000 --> 29:32.237
Meet a skinny, pretty master

29:32.272 --> 29:35.673
and live happily. Okay?

29:36.641 --> 29:40.509
Love... I love you!

29:51.956 --> 29:55.414
Here we go.
Count backwards from ten.

29:57.595 --> 30:01.900
Ten, eleven, twelve...

30:01.935 --> 30:03.162
Backwards!

30:03.735 --> 30:09.696
Nine, eight, seven...

30:16.681 --> 30:18.808
<i>Ammy's 2nd album postponed</i>

30:21.619 --> 30:23.746
You call yourself an agent?
Don't take it out on me!

30:47.345 --> 30:49.314
<i>How can you do this to me?</i>

30:49.349 --> 30:52.408
<i>Call me now,
or I'll report you missing.</i>

30:57.856 --> 31:00.188
Years of suffering is over.

31:00.525 --> 31:04.086
Make peace with yourself
and enjoy freedom.

31:05.530 --> 31:11.435
What was once you...
It's gone forever.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.063
We'll redo the nose.

31:16.341 --> 31:21.301
You bought me this
saying that I'd be as pretty.

31:22.213 --> 31:23.805
Remember?

31:25.984 --> 31:30.353
I'll be pretty soon.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.413
That...

32:33.451 --> 32:35.715
That's me?

32:36.254 --> 32:39.815
Sir, it's flawless.

32:40.458 --> 32:46.260
That's the only flaw.
It's too natural.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.369
I even cry prettily.

33:04.482 --> 33:10.682
Hey! Take it easy.
Your jawbone will drop.

33:39.283 --> 33:40.910

Rating is 5%?

That's hard to achieve.

Bye. Smile, dude.

That's for your eyes.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.567
I don't wanna do the sitcom.

36:14.772 --> 36:17.866
It cost me a fortune

Get in the car.

36:28.352 --> 36:29.876

37:01.819 --> 37:04.788
You got a cut here.

38:05.850 --> 38:08.419
How much is this?

38:08.454 --> 38:10.387
I wouldn't recommend it.

38:10.655 --> 38:15.092
It has a lot of miles on it,

38:15.293 --> 38:17.853
and the brakes are bad.

38:18.362 --> 38:20.887
No air conditioning?

38:21.065 --> 38:23.556
What do you expect

38:24.135 --> 38:28.071

38:30.308 --> 38:32.071
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

Bye.

You're gorgeous.

39:06.410 --> 39:09.140
Don't mind me saying this.

39:10.748 --> 39:12.306
You're beautiful.

39:21.959 --> 39:23.688
I made the right decision.

39:24.095 --> 39:25.995
I needed a car.

39:28.833 --> 39:30.960
The seatbelt?

39:36.307 --> 39:41.040
It's only 5 grand.
No problem.

39:43.147 --> 39:44.444
"You're gorgeous."

39:46.384 --> 39:47.874
"You're beautiful."

39:58.329 --> 40:00.297
It's a bad business day.

40:00.332 --> 40:02.788
And you've added insult
to injury.

40:03.334 --> 40:04.699
Get out of the car.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.499
Get out!

this is happening.

What a moron!

40:37.868 --> 40:40.971
Can you believe this?

40:41.006 --> 40:44.031
She has no conscience.

40:44.208 --> 40:45.232
Damn!

40:45.476 --> 40:47.378
Sir...

40:47.413 --> 40:51.315
If you can't drive, don't!

40:51.350 --> 40:55.085
The road is so wide.
Why crash into me?

40:55.120 --> 40:57.519
I live from hand to mouth,

40:59.423 --> 41:01.186
- You okay?
- What?

41:01.358 --> 41:05.226
You look familiar.
Ever been in my taxi?

41:06.096 --> 41:09.623
You're blocking the traffic!

41:14.038 --> 41:18.375
Direct the traffic.
Move it.

41:18.410 --> 41:19.569
We have an accident here.

41:20.411 --> 41:22.480
You okay?

41:22.515 --> 41:23.414
Yes.

41:23.449 --> 41:24.348
Not hurt?

41:24.383 --> 41:27.317
No, I'm totally fine.

41:28.853 --> 41:29.720
God!

41:29.755 --> 41:32.587
Hey, you're bleeding.

41:32.857 --> 41:34.825
Are you okay?

41:34.860 --> 41:36.417
Absolutely.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.528
But...

41:37.563 --> 41:40.986
It doesn't hurt.
This is embarrassing.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.801
I'm really okay.

41:43.836 --> 41:45.236
The damage to your car is bad.

41:45.271 --> 41:48.038
Know any garage?
I know a good one.

41:48.073 --> 41:49.773
What's your cell number?

41:49.808 --> 41:50.967
What?

41:53.577 --> 41:55.374
I saw the whole thing.

41:55.613 --> 41:57.147
You cut in front of her.

41:57.182 --> 42:00.173
Didn't I?
What was I thinking?

42:01.519 --> 42:03.180
Check her license.

42:03.187 --> 42:04.688
She might not have one.

42:04.723 --> 42:05.789
Are you a cop?

42:05.824 --> 42:08.656
Check her license!

42:09.627 --> 42:10.889
Can I see it?

42:12.129 --> 42:13.323
Here.

42:26.844 --> 42:28.607
There's nothing to worry.

42:28.846 --> 42:32.907
If your friend confirms your ID,
we'll let you go.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.508
I knew she didn't have
a license.

42:35.819 --> 42:39.915
How convenient.
Plastic surgery?

42:40.257 --> 42:44.395
Which hospital is it?
I should get it done, too.

42:44.430 --> 42:48.559
Ma'am?
Her friend is coming.

42:48.899 --> 42:50.301
We don't need her, do we?

42:50.336 --> 42:51.393
Right.

43:14.325 --> 43:15.087
Hanna?

43:19.096 --> 43:20.290
Hanna?

43:20.831 --> 43:22.560
Pork.

43:22.967 --> 43:27.734
I want some... Pork.

43:29.406 --> 43:31.475
Why didn't you feed her?

43:31.510 --> 43:33.577
We sure did!

43:33.612 --> 43:36.705
You should've fed her
3 portions at a meal.

43:38.949 --> 43:42.544
Let's get out of here
and eat some pork.

43:43.520 --> 43:47.047
God, you've lost
so much weight.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.322
When'd you get a perm?

43:59.169 --> 44:00.864

44:03.741 --> 44:05.174
Do I know you?

44:15.052 --> 44:16.417
Hanna?

44:21.225 --> 44:22.351
You...

44:26.930 --> 44:27.897
It's really you!

44:28.365 --> 44:29.457
What?

44:30.401 --> 44:32.335
The silicon might slip
out of place.

44:35.439 --> 44:36.736
Look at you!

44:38.776 --> 44:40.641
What? Go where?

44:40.844 --> 44:42.012
I shouldn't?

44:42.047 --> 44:44.071
They'll recognize you.

44:44.481 --> 44:48.417
You disappeared a year ago.

44:48.585 --> 44:50.746
They've been looking
all over for you.

44:52.489 --> 44:54.787
You ruined Ammy's 2nd album.

44:55.459 --> 44:58.451
They're looking hard
for your replacement.

44:58.629 --> 45:00.927
I can be the replacement.

45:01.131 --> 45:04.328
They'll like me
since I have the same voice.

45:05.335 --> 45:06.270
No?

45:06.305 --> 45:08.172
If they find out, you're done.

45:08.207 --> 45:11.471
You didn't recognize me
until I told you.

45:12.710 --> 45:13.972
No way!

45:14.578 --> 45:23.646
I hate myself
I know I'm fool

45:24.154 --> 45:34.359
But, I can't stop loving you
It hurts me

45:36.300 --> 45:40.430
You're hurting my ears.
See you later.

45:40.904 --> 45:43.634
I'm just so nervous.

45:43.807 --> 45:45.743
Give me another shot.

45:45.778 --> 45:46.710
Get out!

45:46.877 --> 45:47.809
Okay.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.609
Excuse me? Here.

45:58.655 --> 46:00.247
A Korean-American?

46:00.524 --> 46:01.456
Yes.

46:04.728 --> 46:05.922
Send her in.

46:13.270 --> 46:14.635
Jenny?

46:18.876 --> 46:21.970
It says here
you're fluent in Korean.

46:22.579 --> 46:23.876
A little bit.

46:24.014 --> 46:25.413
Lose those shades.

46:32.256 --> 46:33.985
Face us, will you?

46:45.469 --> 46:46.800
Hit it.

46:57.514 --> 47:03.009
# The wind knocks on the window

47:03.253 --> 47:10.022
# Over the room as small as me

47:10.327 --> 47:20.464
# Twinkling stars so beautiful
Filling the room with love

47:20.737 --> 47:24.842
# Don't be hurt

47:24.877 --> 47:32.382
# Caressing my wound gently

47:32.417 --> 47:40.255
# Embracing me to sleep

47:40.891 --> 47:48.889
# Too hurt for my legs to walk

47:49.099 --> 47:54.503
# Eyes so blurry with tears

47:54.671 --> 48:04.081
# Before love
Never meant for me

48:04.116 --> 48:07.244
# I will keep on smiling

48:07.451 --> 48:09.009
She's a slugger.

48:10.087 --> 48:14.456
Look at her, man.
She's far from a slut.

48:19.529 --> 48:25.661
# Like those stars
embroidered in my eyes

48:26.336 --> 48:30.796
# I will love you forever

48:44.821 --> 48:48.757
I think it's over.

48:50.127 --> 48:51.361
Wait outside, please.

48:51.396 --> 48:52.623
Okay.

49:00.971 --> 49:03.997
We're good now!

49:04.508 --> 49:06.738
We're good!

49:08.278 --> 49:10.712
Sang-jun, congratulations.

49:11.949 --> 49:13.416
Putting out my album now?

49:14.985 --> 49:16.282
Leave us alone.

49:17.220 --> 49:18.585
Leave.

49:18.655 --> 49:21.988
Ammy, let's go.

49:25.429 --> 49:28.489
Look.

49:30.567 --> 49:32.169
Can't you see who she is?

49:32.204 --> 49:33.659
Huh?

49:44.014 --> 49:45.276
You know me, don't you?

49:48.685 --> 49:50.653
I think I know you.

49:56.159 --> 49:57.421
You can tell?

49:59.663 --> 50:01.231
You can, can't you?

50:01.266 --> 50:03.756
Of course I can.

50:04.334 --> 50:06.199
Why can't you be honest?

50:07.604 --> 50:09.970
Thought you could fool me?

50:10.941 --> 50:14.344
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

50:14.379 --> 50:16.780
Listen. I just...

50:16.815 --> 50:20.181
You're no different.
Why lie to me?

50:21.385 --> 50:24.755
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

50:24.790 --> 50:28.851
The department store,
the used car market...

50:30.160 --> 50:31.627
You followed me?

50:33.764 --> 50:35.391
Thought I wouldn't know?

50:36.633 --> 50:38.863
You told her I'm the best
producer in the business?

50:38.935 --> 50:40.425
Yes, I am.

50:40.804 --> 50:43.407
Why couldn't you face me...

50:43.442 --> 50:48.071
...and tell me
you wanna be a singer?

50:49.112 --> 50:53.014
Yes, I do.
I want to be a singer.

50:54.751 --> 50:55.619
Right?

50:55.654 --> 51:00.215
Yes, she'll be awesome.
A top singer.

51:00.991 --> 51:02.356
Let's go!

51:04.828 --> 51:07.524
What's wrong with you?

51:07.831 --> 51:09.059
Bye.

51:11.168 --> 51:13.636
She's a dog.

51:16.907 --> 51:20.434
Why the tears?

51:20.677 --> 51:24.044
Look what you did.
You made her cry.

51:25.148 --> 51:30.814
By the way...
Let's get your face fixed up.

51:31.221 --> 51:34.858
Slit your eyes bigger
and get your nosed raised.

51:34.893 --> 51:37.622
No! No way.

51:38.995 --> 51:40.690
You know what?

51:41.331 --> 51:44.823
I'm too scared to go
under a knife.

51:45.001 --> 51:50.337
Plastic surgery?
I would never do it.

51:51.374 --> 51:56.311
It's for those who lack
confidence in themselves.

51:57.214 --> 51:58.415
What?

51:58.450 --> 51:59.677
Wait.

52:02.786 --> 52:07.824
Are you telling me
I'm not pretty enough?

52:07.859 --> 52:10.594
No, I'm not.

52:10.629 --> 52:13.995
A natural beauty?
I love it!

52:14.197 --> 52:17.701
Good for building your image.

52:17.736 --> 52:19.225
Right, Sang-jun?

52:19.503 --> 52:21.835
So you're all natural?

52:26.042 --> 52:28.408
I surely am.

52:33.517 --> 52:34.745
Let's sign a contract.

52:34.918 --> 52:37.187
Take a good look at her.

52:37.222 --> 52:38.688
Think about it, Dad.

52:38.723 --> 52:42.392
Jenny has a quality
that you can't find...

52:42.427 --> 52:46.062
...in any other girls today.

52:46.097 --> 52:47.859
What's so special about her?

52:48.365 --> 52:50.526
She looks a bit awkward.

52:50.734 --> 52:53.202
Personally, I prefer Ammy.

52:53.370 --> 52:57.136
An image of innocence.
A natural beauty.

52:57.440 --> 53:00.204
It's what money can't buy.

53:00.877 --> 53:03.209
Right. That's what it is.

53:03.713 --> 53:05.647
You're sleeping her,
aren't you?

53:06.650 --> 53:09.414
She's not a tramp.

53:09.886 --> 53:14.891
She has a special quality
that money can't buy.

53:14.926 --> 53:18.156
Can't you see that?

53:18.328 --> 53:20.159
You're a hound dog.

53:20.330 --> 53:22.423
Look who's talking.

53:27.204 --> 53:28.398
Dad?

53:32.842 --> 53:33.710
Come on!

53:33.745 --> 53:37.806
We don't need his help.
Let's just do it.

53:38.114 --> 53:40.550
Don't disappoint me.

53:40.585 --> 53:42.450
It'll speed up things.

53:42.619 --> 53:45.222
I can't kiss his ass anymore.

53:45.257 --> 53:46.356
Come on!

53:46.391 --> 53:47.687
What?

53:47.924 --> 53:51.027
This isn't so like you.

53:51.062 --> 53:52.494
What's your good quality?

53:53.196 --> 53:54.397
Perseverance!

53:54.432 --> 53:56.092
Why trashing it now?

53:56.299 --> 54:02.329
I'm counting on you. Big brother.
You trust me, don't you?

54:02.939 --> 54:07.376
Don't call me that.
I'm only 13 months older.

54:07.577 --> 54:11.172
Let's do this, okay?

54:11.815 --> 54:13.214
God damn it!

54:13.383 --> 54:15.613
You're bad!

54:17.487 --> 54:24.484
Dad, please... Dad!

54:25.262 --> 54:26.593
Okay, that's it.

54:26.630 --> 54:30.400
Just like that.
That's good.

54:30.435 --> 54:31.560
Good! Okay!

54:48.275 --> 54:50.243
Ammy!

54:50.944 --> 54:52.605
Drag it out at the end.

54:55.449 --> 54:58.077
They'll go crazy.

55:12.833 --> 55:14.061
Pee...

55:15.135 --> 55:20.774
Pee... Pee is coming.

55:20.809 --> 55:23.641
Excuse me? Nurse!

55:25.378 --> 55:27.107
What's new isn't always good.

55:27.280 --> 55:31.685
That's not it.

55:31.720 --> 55:34.988
You're making me sick
of what I had before.

55:35.023 --> 55:37.157
<i>You want me to walk?</i>

55:37.192 --> 55:38.759
You'll be sorry.

55:38.794 --> 55:40.494
I never look for a dog
that's run.

55:40.529 --> 55:42.962
I always find my dog,
no matter what.

55:43.063 --> 55:44.997
Watch me. I'll find Hanna.

55:45.065 --> 55:46.498
Don't bring Hanna up!

55:50.203 --> 55:51.795
Stop talking about her.

55:56.476 --> 55:57.704
More coming.

55:57.878 --> 56:00.714
<i>If she was worried
about her father...</i>

56:00.749 --> 56:02.739
...she would've showed up
long ago.

56:03.850 --> 56:06.186
You're wasting your time.

56:06.221 --> 56:09.314
Focus on the sitcom.
Memorize your lines.

56:09.589 --> 56:10.824
I'm a singer.

56:10.859 --> 56:11.916
You realized that now?

56:15.028 --> 56:16.427
Hello?

56:18.532 --> 56:21.831
I'm a singer. A singer!

56:22.235 --> 56:23.637
I want to be a singer!

56:23.672 --> 56:26.071
A singer!

56:26.373 --> 56:30.833
God is the only one
who can do everything.

56:32.045 --> 56:37.881
We humans do
what we're capable of.

56:44.591 --> 56:46.226
Jung-min, look at him.

56:46.261 --> 56:49.662
He's been waving at me.

56:51.731 --> 56:52.966
What took you so long?

56:53.001 --> 56:55.332
I've been admiring you.

56:57.437 --> 56:58.768
What are we doing today?

56:59.172 --> 57:01.640
We're making you happy.

57:02.709 --> 57:05.473
How does that sound?

57:10.517 --> 57:14.681
That's right.
I'm THE Jenny.

57:18.558 --> 57:20.253
Put suntan oil on me.

57:22.762 --> 57:24.354
Why should I?

57:29.336 --> 57:31.031
You have nice boobs.

57:31.872 --> 57:34.397
Of course.
You know how much...

57:35.475 --> 57:37.807
I love them so much.

57:39.412 --> 57:41.846
They're natural, right?

57:42.415 --> 57:44.849
You're a natural beauty,
aren't you?

57:45.151 --> 57:48.951
Of course!
It's done so naturally.

57:52.158 --> 57:54.092
I'm natural.

57:54.861 --> 58:01.528
Turn around.
Come on. Good.

58:04.604 --> 58:09.632
Hey, you're so fair-skinned.
You're from California, right?

58:10.377 --> 58:11.503
Yes.

58:12.012 --> 58:13.775
Did you live in the basement?

58:16.316 --> 58:18.716
You look like a bean curd.

58:19.119 --> 58:24.716
So tacky. Never got a tanning?
Never been to a tanning saloon?

58:29.162 --> 58:36.034
So? You covered your breasts
for 3 hours?

58:36.469 --> 58:40.906
You thought they'd pop
inside the tanning machine?

58:43.443 --> 58:46.310
That's a load of bullshit.

58:46.713 --> 58:49.182
She got a boob job, too.

58:49.217 --> 58:51.207
You're talking about one
on that sitcom, right?

58:51.484 --> 58:55.443
She has bags of saline solution
for boobs.

58:55.622 --> 58:58.391
They hurt when touched.

58:58.426 --> 59:00.894
And they don't feel good
to touch.

59:00.929 --> 59:05.732
That's why
I put silicone bags in you.

59:05.767 --> 59:10.403
Right?
Not because they're cheaper.

59:10.438 --> 59:14.863
Right? Please, tell me.

59:15.241 --> 59:19.200
I'm sad. So sad.

59:19.813 --> 59:23.010
Do you know what it is?

59:24.451 --> 59:28.788
It's lack of confidence.
Didn't I tell you?

59:28.823 --> 59:30.156
Unless you act confidently,

59:30.191 --> 59:32.784
you can't win his heart.

59:32.993 --> 59:35.052
Beauty is attitude, okay?

59:40.500 --> 59:42.661
This is an engine.

59:44.738 --> 59:47.639
No way I'm doing that.

01:00:01.421 --> 01:00:03.981
# Here we go again

01:00:04.758 --> 01:00:07.454
# Make it hot, Baby

01:00:07.694 --> 01:00:11.858
# Oh. Don't be afraid

01:00:13.533 --> 01:00:16.024
# High in the sky

01:00:16.302 --> 01:00:19.499
# The sun shines the way

01:00:19.672 --> 01:00:24.405
# Oh. Don't you stop, Baby

01:00:26.813 --> 01:00:29.043
# Maria...

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:32.349
Let's call it a day.

01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.452
What do you say?

01:00:38.892 --> 01:00:44.956
The video quality is good.

01:00:45.131 --> 01:00:46.860
What cam did you use?

01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:51.770
Not that.
What do you feel from her song?

01:00:55.742 --> 01:00:58.267
Her song carries her heart...

01:00:59.446 --> 01:01:05.985
...for someone that she loves.
I think. No?

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.316
Can't you sing like her?

01:01:08.488 --> 01:01:11.855
You care too much
about how you look.

01:01:14.561 --> 01:01:20.158
Come on, she's ugly.

01:01:20.567 --> 01:01:24.170
You must've been embarrassed
seen with her.

01:01:24.205 --> 01:01:25.933
Stop it!

01:01:28.908 --> 01:01:31.001
She was special to me.

01:01:32.946 --> 01:01:36.404
You're here, thanks to her.

01:01:42.522 --> 01:01:43.590
Still...

01:01:43.625 --> 01:01:45.922
You're no half of her.

01:01:47.994 --> 01:01:49.291
Why are you crying?

01:01:53.399 --> 01:01:54.798
Are you nuts?

01:01:57.504 --> 01:02:00.337
So you'll confess to him?

01:02:01.007 --> 01:02:02.770
After all this?

01:02:03.977 --> 01:02:06.513
You've committed a fraud.

01:02:06.548 --> 01:02:09.573
So I should do it
before it's too late.

01:02:09.782 --> 01:02:11.977
He'll understand.

01:02:13.186 --> 01:02:16.622
Remember 3 types of women
I told you about?

01:02:17.757 --> 01:02:20.360
I'm a pretty one now.

01:02:20.395 --> 01:02:24.023
No, it doesn't apply.

01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:25.595
You know why?

01:02:26.099 --> 01:02:30.433
Those with plastic surgery
aren't women. But monsters.

01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:36.372
Jung-min...

01:02:36.776 --> 01:02:41.347
All men are the same.
They say plastic surgery is OK,

01:02:41.382 --> 01:02:44.417
but not with their girls.
That's men.

01:02:44.452 --> 01:02:48.877
And Sang-jun is a typical man.
Or he's gay.

01:02:49.155 --> 01:02:52.488
What are you,
an expert in relationships?

01:02:52.692 --> 01:02:56.025
You sound like you have
tons of experience.

01:02:56.996 --> 01:03:01.401
More than you.
At least, my love isn't one-way.

01:03:01.436 --> 01:03:06.100
Oh, you're in a crazy love?

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.307
With whom? This guy?

01:03:10.843 --> 01:03:13.505
Is he in love with you, too?

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.873
Or trying to sell you stuff?

01:03:16.049 --> 01:03:17.650
You ransacked my bag?

01:03:17.685 --> 01:03:23.213
You didn't empty the pockets
after wearing my clothes.

01:03:26.559 --> 01:03:32.498
Whatever it is...
Don't buy anything from him.

01:03:32.665 --> 01:03:34.234
I'm not like you.

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:40.503
I know. Like I did.
No, like the old Hanna.

01:03:41.007 --> 01:03:46.012
Don't do everything his way
like a fool.

01:03:46.047 --> 01:03:49.413
At the end of the day, you get
the same thing. "We're too different."

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:54.653
He'll never say
you're ugly and fat.

01:03:57.857 --> 01:04:02.385
Like the old saying,
nothing beats experience.

01:04:03.196 --> 01:04:04.754
Confess to him.

01:04:11.404 --> 01:04:12.769
What are you doing here?

01:04:13.039 --> 01:04:17.476
That video...
Should we study it more?

01:04:21.748 --> 01:04:24.239
Come in.

01:04:30.256 --> 01:04:34.625
Mr. CHOI once told me.

01:04:35.628 --> 01:04:39.223
Do many Korean girls
do plastic surgery?

01:04:39.999 --> 01:04:42.866
I'm just asking.

01:04:43.202 --> 01:04:46.694
What do you think about it?

01:05:02.755 --> 01:05:06.247
Didn't you tell me
you didn't understand?

01:05:06.626 --> 01:05:08.560
What are you doing?

01:05:09.729 --> 01:05:13.066
You said it was for those
who lack confidence.

01:05:13.101 --> 01:05:15.261
I think the same.
Stop it.

01:05:16.569 --> 01:05:17.729
Come here.

01:05:18.371 --> 01:05:21.807
Sorry. Let's go.

01:05:32.452 --> 01:05:33.976
We're doing the concert.

01:05:34.454 --> 01:05:36.046
It's been a while.

01:05:40.226 --> 01:05:41.420
Love!

01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:48.768
How'd you end up here?
What happened?

01:05:48.803 --> 01:05:52.602
I'm sorry.
It's my bad. Love!

01:05:57.677 --> 01:06:00.771
You feed her raw fish?

01:06:01.214 --> 01:06:05.674
Why am I yawning?
She loves raw fish.

01:06:09.122 --> 01:06:12.888
Anyway, we're on the same page
about plastic surgery.

01:06:16.262 --> 01:06:22.326
Go away.
Then again...

01:06:22.535 --> 01:06:26.232
Desire to become pretty
isn't a bad thing.

01:06:26.472 --> 01:06:30.738
Men who are only after
pretty women are bad.

01:06:30.943 --> 01:06:37.781
And these days...
Okay, okay. And these days...

01:06:39.352 --> 01:06:41.149
Hey. Bang!

01:06:42.989 --> 01:06:48.359
And it's like cosmetics today.

01:06:49.395 --> 01:06:54.298
Why do they hide it then?
They hate revealing it.

01:06:54.667 --> 01:06:57.101
It's a lame self-justification.

01:06:59.038 --> 01:07:00.369
Can't you see?

01:07:00.606 --> 01:07:04.975
That's why you stand out
in this business.

01:07:05.778 --> 01:07:08.110
This is fresh.
Eat some.

01:07:15.621 --> 01:07:17.316
About plastic surgery...

01:07:18.791 --> 01:07:21.123
I've thought about it.

01:07:23.196 --> 01:07:25.289
I think I can understand.

01:07:31.437 --> 01:07:33.530
Only if it's not my girl.

01:07:36.776 --> 01:07:38.403
I absolutely hate it.

01:07:42.648 --> 01:07:44.115
But I understand.

01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:51.850
Let's go.

01:07:52.525 --> 01:07:54.288
Go, Natural beauty!

01:07:55.895 --> 01:07:57.522
Goodnight.

01:08:03.135 --> 01:08:04.193
Jenny!

01:08:06.973 --> 01:08:07.701
Out of the way!

01:08:09.842 --> 01:08:11.104
Hi.

01:08:11.944 --> 01:08:13.878
What's wrong?

01:08:19.285 --> 01:08:22.220
You shot a film here.

01:08:23.788 --> 01:08:25.484
How long has it been?

01:08:29.895 --> 01:08:31.261
Who put you up to this?

01:08:32.865 --> 01:08:34.992
Put it out.

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:41.840
Nobody did.
I just like her so much.

01:08:42.041 --> 01:08:46.045
Aren't you that delivery man?

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.014
That's right.
You remember me.

01:08:52.919 --> 01:08:54.944
I understand, but...

01:08:56.889 --> 01:08:57.857
Why laughing?

01:08:57.892 --> 01:08:59.221
It tickles.

01:09:01.894 --> 01:09:04.764
If this gets out,
it's the violation of publicity.

01:09:04.799 --> 01:09:07.961
I like her so much, and...

01:09:08.134 --> 01:09:10.169
You like her so much...

01:09:10.203 --> 01:09:13.627
...but didn't care
how she feels being watched?

01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:17.009
Documenting her private life
is a crime.

01:09:17.044 --> 01:09:22.948
No, it was for myself.

01:09:23.282 --> 01:09:25.408
Stop laughing.

01:09:25.585 --> 01:09:28.884
This is what stalkers do.

01:09:29.087 --> 01:09:32.615
Aren't you ashamed
of yourself?

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.359
Wait.
Don't be too harsh.

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:41.298
Give him a break.
He did it out of liking me.

01:09:42.134 --> 01:09:45.103
What's the big deal?

01:09:45.438 --> 01:09:48.908
What's a person to do
when all they can do is...

01:09:48.943 --> 01:09:50.738
...watch from afar?

01:09:51.042 --> 01:09:54.069
Do you have any idea
what it feels like...

01:09:54.313 --> 01:09:59.151
...not being able to confess
one's love?

01:09:59.186 --> 01:10:00.345
Excuse me.

01:10:01.354 --> 01:10:05.791
How do you know so well
how I feel?

01:10:07.693 --> 01:10:12.096
This is what
you had to say, right?

01:10:29.415 --> 01:10:30.507
Daddy...

01:10:32.518 --> 01:10:33.285
Ammy!

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.947
Let go of me. Let go.

01:10:45.064 --> 01:10:46.929
<i>Becoming someone new?</i>

01:10:47.233 --> 01:10:50.259
<i>You have to forget yourself.</i>

01:10:50.670 --> 01:10:55.369
<i>Your past, memories...
Erase them all.</i>

01:11:20.433 --> 01:11:21.866
I even sweat pretty.

01:11:26.605 --> 01:11:29.199
<i>Maria.</i>

01:11:31.577 --> 01:11:39.916
Ave maria, a~ maria~ mari

01:11:40.519 --> 01:11:44.114
Practicing at the sauna
will help.

01:11:44.523 --> 01:11:50.223
Tell me.
Do you have to sing?

01:11:50.629 --> 01:11:55.566
Of course! Singers sing.
You kidding me?

01:11:55.935 --> 01:11:58.927
No. All I'm saying is...

01:11:59.105 --> 01:12:01.198
Do what you can.

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:05.101
You'd be God if you did
everything you want.

01:12:07.747 --> 01:12:08.975
What?

01:12:10.049 --> 01:12:11.778
It's what my dad says.

01:12:12.618 --> 01:12:16.952
God is the only one
who can do everything.

01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:22.784
We humans do
what we're capable of.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:38.239
<i>You're a phony</i>

01:12:42.615 --> 01:12:44.810
Is this van a phony?

01:12:53.259 --> 01:12:55.557
Jenny, it's your phone.

01:13:00.399 --> 01:13:04.165
Hello? What?
Jung-min did?

01:13:04.804 --> 01:13:06.672
<i>To a hospital? Why?</i>

01:13:06.707 --> 01:13:09.004
Jung-min tried to kill herself.

01:13:09.208 --> 01:13:12.234
It's your first TV show.
You can't screw it up.

01:13:12.578 --> 01:13:16.036
My friend is more important!

01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:21.817
We were quiet worried.

01:13:22.054 --> 01:13:23.885
But we found nothing
in her stomach.

01:13:24.423 --> 01:13:26.516
It'd been digested.

01:13:26.992 --> 01:13:31.622
30 sleeping pills can be
lethal for others.

01:13:31.964 --> 01:13:34.865
So she's in a coma?

01:13:35.801 --> 01:13:37.894
She's just sleeping.

01:13:38.237 --> 01:13:40.797
Like a bear hibernating.

01:13:41.006 --> 01:13:45.943
It can't be explained medically.
She was lucky.

01:13:46.378 --> 01:13:49.006
30 sleeping pills could
kill an elephant.

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:01.918
What's this?

01:14:02.561 --> 01:14:04.290
She bought this?

01:14:07.199 --> 01:14:08.962
A home sauna?

01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:12.602
Jenny?

01:14:12.972 --> 01:14:14.406
I've been calling you, Babe.

01:14:14.441 --> 01:14:16.499
What's going on?

01:14:16.742 --> 01:14:19.438
Think of what you want
for lunch.

01:14:20.946 --> 01:14:23.005
Hey, Su-jin.
How are you?

01:14:26.318 --> 01:14:28.878
Su-jung! I meant Su-jung.

01:14:29.421 --> 01:14:31.355
Wanna go swimming?

01:14:32.758 --> 01:14:33.884
Excuse me.

01:14:36.128 --> 01:14:38.187
I'll call you back.

01:14:46.272 --> 01:14:50.003
Did you dump her
because you loved her?

01:14:52.778 --> 01:14:56.215
Why so fast?

01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:59.818
You should've waited to see
what a home sauna can do.

01:14:59.853 --> 01:15:02.946
Did you tell her
not to go on a diet?

01:15:03.856 --> 01:15:08.850
"I'll be upset if you lose weight."
You told her so?

01:15:10.095 --> 01:15:14.122
Why didn't you be a man
and tell her the truth?

01:15:16.835 --> 01:15:19.531
That you hate her being fat.
And you were desperate...

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:24.473
...to sell your products.

01:15:26.912 --> 01:15:28.641
If you loved her...

01:15:30.916 --> 01:15:33.817
Why'd you have to dump her?

01:15:38.524 --> 01:15:40.025
You bastard!

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:42.695
Wait! What's wrong?

01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:47.833
You don't know?
Is it a crime to be ugly?

01:15:47.868 --> 01:15:52.237
We're not charity cases.
I have so much to say, but...

01:15:52.272 --> 01:15:54.073
Wait! Who are you?

01:15:54.108 --> 01:15:55.165
Damn!

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:06.585
What's going on?

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:07.653
Who's this?

01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:08.554
Who are you?

01:16:08.589 --> 01:16:12.012
Oh, you're in this together.

01:16:12.691 --> 01:16:13.993
Calm down!

01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:18.163
Hey! You two are dead.

01:16:18.198 --> 01:16:19.765
Stay right here.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.426
I'll call the cops.

01:16:22.434 --> 01:16:24.026
You okay?

01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:26.397
My nose...

01:16:44.423 --> 01:16:48.416
Call the cops.
Or take this and shut up.

01:16:53.198 --> 01:16:55.067
What'd I tell you?

01:16:55.102 --> 01:16:56.402
That miniskirt is
an invitation to a rapist.

01:16:56.437 --> 01:16:59.394
Look what happened.

01:16:59.905 --> 01:17:04.205
Sorry. What if I was late?
Let's go.

01:17:13.585 --> 01:17:14.745
Get her dress!

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.946
She's here.
1 minute to go. Standby.

01:17:18.123 --> 01:17:19.425
What happened?

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.292
How much time?

01:17:20.327 --> 01:17:21.860
Less than a minute!

01:17:21.895 --> 01:17:23.885
Okay.

01:17:40.546 --> 01:17:44.083
Look who's here.
Isn't this Sang-jun?

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:47.486
What's that?
Is that her concept?

01:17:47.521 --> 01:17:51.290
Sang-jun, this concept
doesn't appeal to me.

01:17:51.325 --> 01:17:53.190
Hurry!

01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:07.666
Don't worry.
They'll love your voice.

01:18:12.811 --> 01:18:14.711
This is it.

01:18:17.516 --> 01:18:21.646
Show them what you got.

01:18:22.121 --> 01:18:24.453
We can't lose to them.

01:18:25.057 --> 01:18:26.149
Right.

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:30.093
Can you do it?

01:18:31.230 --> 01:18:33.664
Okay. I believe in you.
No matter what...

01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:42.067
Get a room!
Get out there!

01:18:42.241 --> 01:18:46.007
Okay, Jenny.

01:18:49.648 --> 01:18:52.617
They're not a couple.
Trust me.

01:18:57.156 --> 01:18:59.556
Here is Jenny!

01:18:59.691 --> 01:19:00.623
"Maria"

01:19:18.377 --> 01:19:20.777
# Here we go again

01:19:21.647 --> 01:19:24.343
# Make it hot, Baby

01:19:24.516 --> 01:19:28.748
# Oh, don't be afraid

01:19:30.389 --> 01:19:36.294
# High in the sky
The sun shines the way

01:19:36.495 --> 01:19:40.659
# Oh, don't you stop, Baby

01:19:43.802 --> 01:19:48.466
# Maria Ave maria

01:19:49.741 --> 01:19:54.303
# Fly and catch those clouds

01:19:55.681 --> 01:20:00.277
# Maria Ave maria

01:20:01.687 --> 01:20:06.351
# Strong against violent waves

01:20:06.592 --> 01:20:07.718
She's pretty good.

01:20:07.893 --> 01:20:12.330
# Maria Ave maria

01:20:12.531 --> 01:20:14.032
She's good.

01:20:14.067 --> 01:20:18.526
# Fly and catch those clouds

01:20:19.738 --> 01:20:24.402
# Maria Ave maria

01:20:25.844 --> 01:20:29.514
# Strong against violent waves

01:20:29.549 --> 01:20:31.641
What's her concept?

01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:34.584
It's singing.

01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:39.853
What's yours?

01:20:41.893 --> 01:20:43.121
Strawberry milk?

01:20:46.832 --> 01:20:51.565
# Maria Ave maria

01:20:52.904 --> 01:20:57.534
# Flay and catch those clouds

01:20:58.810 --> 01:21:03.509
# Maria Ave maria

01:21:04.883 --> 01:21:09.286
# Strong against the violent waves

01:21:10.822 --> 01:21:15.156
# Maria~

01:21:21.967 --> 01:21:25.494
This sauna thing is okay.

01:21:32.844 --> 01:21:35.506
<i>You're a phony</i>

01:21:36.248 --> 01:21:43.288
Thanks to a new model,
the sales have...

01:21:43.323 --> 01:21:46.416
Skyrocketed! Dad?

01:21:48.293 --> 01:21:49.726
Spit out the gum.

01:22:03.542 --> 01:22:04.873
<i>"Jenny"</i>

01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:06.941
<i>"New star comes up!"</i>

01:22:49.688 --> 01:22:53.419
I'm drunk.
God, this is awkward.

01:23:25.657 --> 01:23:28.683
He'll know they're fake
if he touches them.

01:23:33.298 --> 01:23:36.665
Not there.

01:23:47.813 --> 01:23:49.872
Not there, either.

01:24:31.623 --> 01:24:34.217
Should I sing for you?

01:24:35.126 --> 01:24:36.957
You wanna work now?

01:24:57.215 --> 01:24:58.049
This way.

01:24:58.084 --> 01:24:58.817
What?

01:24:58.852 --> 01:25:00.216
Come on.

01:25:00.385 --> 01:25:01.283
Jenny?

01:25:05.223 --> 01:25:10.456
Answer it.
Answer it, will you?

01:25:10.829 --> 01:25:12.864
I know it all.

01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:14.559
You even watch porn.

01:25:18.169 --> 01:25:19.771
What are we doing?

01:25:19.806 --> 01:25:21.534
What type do you want?

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.741
A nurse, a high school girl,
a secretary?

01:25:24.876 --> 01:25:27.367
What? A nurse?

01:25:28.046 --> 01:25:31.846
Okay, it's a favorite pick.
A nurse it is.

01:25:34.286 --> 01:25:38.814
Jenny, open the door.
This isn't it.

01:25:43.528 --> 01:25:47.132
Just try to relax.
It'll help.

01:25:47.167 --> 01:25:48.463
What should I do with it?

01:25:52.337 --> 01:25:53.395
Should I rip it?

01:25:53.572 --> 01:25:59.135
See? There you go.
You can wear it over your head.

01:26:16.962 --> 01:26:23.492
Hakuna Matata. The African symbol
has granted me my wish.

01:28:01.533 --> 01:28:04.661
Do many Korean girls
do plastic surgery?

01:28:05.403 --> 01:28:10.033
Do you know how it feels
hiding your love?

01:28:21.219 --> 01:28:23.822
<i>You wrote this song?</i>

01:28:23.857 --> 01:28:25.084
<i>Yes.</i>

01:28:26.191 --> 01:28:32.027
<i>When you were writing it...
What came across your mind?</i>

01:28:32.197 --> 01:28:36.531
<i>I just wrote it
looking at the stars.</i>

01:28:42.107 --> 01:28:43.438
What are you doing?

01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:47.637
Watching porn again?

01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:02.382
About last night...
It never happened, okay?

01:29:04.429 --> 01:29:05.497
Last night...

01:29:05.532 --> 01:29:10.025
Leave, will you?
Let me finish watching porn.

01:29:22.113 --> 01:29:23.603
<i>Jenny's Album Launching Party</i>

01:29:51.643 --> 01:30:00.073
Pull that up. If Sang-jun sees it,
he'll be upset. Hello?

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:06.250
Damn, she's almost naked.
I'll be back.

01:30:09.828 --> 01:30:15.824
Hey. Hey! Congrats!
Your fan is here.

01:30:16.601 --> 01:30:19.695
Someone dying to see you.

01:30:20.371 --> 01:30:22.396
I can't hear you.
What?

01:30:31.416 --> 01:30:32.747
I brought this for you.

01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:39.649
- Here.
- What are you doing?

01:30:44.395 --> 01:30:46.226
What are you doing?

01:30:52.370 --> 01:30:54.031
Take it.

01:31:14.025 --> 01:31:15.617
You know him?

01:31:17.762 --> 01:31:21.960
Just... A fan of mine, I hear.

01:31:31.409 --> 01:31:33.104
Who brought him?

01:31:35.079 --> 01:31:36.410
Did you?

01:31:39.784 --> 01:31:41.979
Take him back home.

01:31:51.496 --> 01:31:56.434
He's your fan.
Why didn't you take the doll?

01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:57.201
Jung-min...

01:31:57.236 --> 01:31:58.259
Let's go.

01:32:16.955 --> 01:32:18.684
Still here?

01:32:20.692 --> 01:32:23.855
Go to bed early
for the concert tomorrow.

01:32:27.165 --> 01:32:31.966
I know that old man.

01:32:33.271 --> 01:32:36.263
I know.
He's your fan.

01:32:38.509 --> 01:32:43.913
No. I mean he is...

01:32:44.248 --> 01:32:47.775
Stop it. KANG Hanna.

01:32:52.857 --> 01:32:57.351
What'd you just call me?

01:32:58.963 --> 01:33:01.830
Don't worry.
Nobody else knows.

01:33:03.801 --> 01:33:05.462
I didn't, either.

01:33:09.707 --> 01:33:12.972
When'd you find out?

01:33:17.615 --> 01:33:19.947
Is that important?

01:33:20.685 --> 01:33:23.153
You're Jenny now.

01:33:24.122 --> 01:33:26.215
And it's Jenny's
first concert tomorrow.

01:33:28.393 --> 01:33:36.323
How... You knew
he was my dad?

01:33:38.770 --> 01:33:44.037
I gave both Hanna
and Jenny a chance.

01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:54.841
It's scary.
So I'm only a product.

01:33:56.054 --> 01:33:58.318
Hanna is worthless,

01:33:58.656 --> 01:34:01.716
but Jenny is worth a fortune.
Is that it?

01:34:03.227 --> 01:34:05.718
Because of you...

01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:11.891
That I've been deceiving you...
It's been so hard.

01:34:15.006 --> 01:34:18.533
Now I see I was a big fool.

01:34:20.178 --> 01:34:24.512
Why'd you take my dog?

01:34:24.749 --> 01:34:26.484
As a hostage?

01:34:26.519 --> 01:34:27.951
That's enough.

01:34:28.486 --> 01:34:32.980
You find me repulsive
with plastic surgery?

01:34:33.191 --> 01:34:36.649
I said enough! Stop it.

01:34:36.861 --> 01:34:38.692
So you avoided me.

01:34:40.164 --> 01:34:41.654
Watch your voice.

01:34:49.841 --> 01:34:56.474
I'll do the concert.
I'll do it well. But...

01:34:58.649 --> 01:35:01.083
Get rid of these.

01:35:03.955 --> 01:35:06.549
They're repulsive and scary.

01:35:23.641 --> 01:35:26.576
I'm fine.
It doesn't hurt.

01:35:27.311 --> 01:35:30.474
It's nothing, compared to
what I went through.

01:35:31.215 --> 01:35:34.480
I cut off my bone and skin.

01:35:35.887 --> 01:35:43.427
Laying on the table...

01:35:43.462 --> 01:35:46.089
You know whom I thought of?

01:35:51.569 --> 01:35:53.969
I never knew...

01:35:55.973 --> 01:35:58.339
I thought that was painful.

01:35:58.943 --> 01:36:00.467
But this is worse.

01:36:15.126 --> 01:36:20.826
You broke my heart.
Tissue won't fix it.

01:36:34.312 --> 01:36:36.803
Now you cut yourself?

01:36:37.215 --> 01:36:41.845
You should be able to fix
something simple like this.

01:36:42.653 --> 01:36:45.144
Give it a shot, okay?

01:36:45.656 --> 01:36:47.180
Thanks, Doc.

01:36:50.895 --> 01:36:54.991
And pay me.
You're making a fortune.

01:36:57.768 --> 01:37:02.330
That ticket is expensive.
Please, come.

01:37:04.408 --> 01:37:06.774
I want money,
not a concert ticket.

01:37:12.250 --> 01:37:15.947
God damn it!
It's complimentary!

01:37:20.891 --> 01:37:24.691
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to the concert?

01:37:28.966 --> 01:37:31.628
Someone sent this.

01:37:36.173 --> 01:37:39.939
I'm sorry.
I'll take the responsibility.

01:37:40.244 --> 01:37:42.337
You will?

01:37:42.546 --> 01:37:46.642
Okay then.
Cancel the concert.

01:37:50.388 --> 01:37:52.413
I can't do that.

01:37:54.191 --> 01:37:57.524
Dad, that's unnecessary.

01:37:58.062 --> 01:38:00.155
I will quit.

01:38:01.899 --> 01:38:07.166
Stay out. If we don't,
this will go to the press.

01:38:07.471 --> 01:38:10.201
That she was a singer
for Ammy.

01:38:11.509 --> 01:38:14.307
It isn't just about the label.

01:38:14.912 --> 01:38:19.611
What about cosmetics?
You'll eat them all?

01:38:22.787 --> 01:38:26.382
You know the contract
inside and out.

01:38:26.691 --> 01:38:30.422
Unless you'll pay penalty,
do as I say.

01:38:30.895 --> 01:38:33.693
Put out her nude album.

01:38:33.998 --> 01:38:36.100
Do it before it's too late.

01:38:36.135 --> 01:38:39.001
We'll squeeze out of her
whatever we can.

01:38:39.170 --> 01:38:40.797
Dad!

01:38:42.306 --> 01:38:46.344
You're grown old.
And scared.

01:38:46.379 --> 01:38:49.313
Son of a bitch,
I made you who you are!

01:39:23.314 --> 01:39:25.248
Company's stock price...

01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:28.784
You forgot
who helped it rise?

01:39:30.187 --> 01:39:33.623
I know who's behind this.
I'll handle it.

01:39:34.258 --> 01:39:36.158
We're doing the concert.

01:39:37.628 --> 01:39:39.653
And it'll be a success.

01:39:46.804 --> 01:39:49.295
Let's go.
We have a concert to do.

01:39:52.176 --> 01:39:53.507
Get up.

01:40:03.721 --> 01:40:06.781
Damn, he messed it up.

01:40:08.392 --> 01:40:10.758
I made it worse.

01:40:15.933 --> 01:40:19.664
You said it didn't hurt.
But it does.

01:40:21.839 --> 01:40:26.606
Don't worry about it.
I'll handle Ammy.

01:40:50.534 --> 01:40:54.903
Jung-min, last night...
I'm sorry.

01:40:55.906 --> 01:40:57.305
About what?

01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:02.973
You brought my dad?

01:41:05.015 --> 01:41:06.949
Your dad?

01:41:07.618 --> 01:41:12.851
Oh, that old man?
He slept at my place.

01:41:13.824 --> 01:41:19.854
Cause he was locked
out of the hospital.

01:41:21.932 --> 01:41:25.891
And, doesn't he have to
see your concert?

01:41:27.771 --> 01:41:30.296
If you got a problem,
tell me.

01:41:30.875 --> 01:41:35.175
Then again,
he means nothing to you.

01:41:38.649 --> 01:41:46.681
Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Jenny!

01:42:03.741 --> 01:42:05.868
Why can't you do it?

01:42:10.548 --> 01:42:13.108
I said it was okay.

01:42:51.088 --> 01:42:52.919
Don't you get it?

01:42:54.291 --> 01:42:57.385
This isn't for me
nor Ammy.

01:42:57.695 --> 01:43:01.495
It's your show.
Do it for yourself.

01:43:01.966 --> 01:43:05.732
For nobody else,
but yourself.

01:44:44.268 --> 01:44:45.428
Stop!

01:44:54.078 --> 01:44:55.670
I can't do this.

01:44:58.382 --> 01:45:00.009
I really can't.

01:45:02.619 --> 01:45:06.646
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

01:45:12.196 --> 01:45:14.391
I'm not Jenny.

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:20.330
I'm Hanna. KANG Hanna.

01:45:27.277 --> 01:45:33.978
I was an ugly, fat girl.

01:45:35.419 --> 01:45:43.656
So... I sang for someone else
hiding in the back.

01:45:47.598 --> 01:45:49.463
Then I got plastic surgery.

01:45:51.835 --> 01:45:57.000
From head to toe...
Everything.

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:05.510
Now that I'm pretty...

01:46:06.784 --> 01:46:08.945
I can sing.

01:46:11.822 --> 01:46:13.585
I've been in love.

01:46:17.628 --> 01:46:22.292
I was so happy
being Jenny.

01:46:25.369 --> 01:46:28.634
But I'm sorry.

01:46:29.973 --> 01:46:32.373
I ruined it.

01:46:38.415 --> 01:46:40.349
I've deserted my friend.

01:46:42.886 --> 01:46:44.911
My dad.

01:46:47.124 --> 01:46:49.217
And myself.

01:46:51.628 --> 01:46:56.622
I don't know who
I am anymore.

01:46:59.703 --> 01:47:02.228
I can't remember

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:07.137
what I looked like.
I can't.

01:47:08.946 --> 01:47:11.278
I miss you, Hanna.

01:47:34.004 --> 01:47:35.096
Hanna...

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.667
That's me.

01:47:42.045 --> 01:47:43.706
KANG Hanna.

01:47:53.724 --> 01:47:56.557
It's okay.

01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:06.858
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:48:21.919 --> 01:48:23.147
Dad!

01:48:24.288 --> 01:48:27.086
Jenny isn't here.

01:48:27.824 --> 01:48:33.262
But if you wanna hear...

01:48:33.497 --> 01:48:36.625
...that fat, ugly girl sing...

01:48:38.502 --> 01:48:43.769
Please, listen to me sing
once for all.

01:48:46.276 --> 01:48:51.805
# Crawling to me like a dream

01:48:51.982 --> 01:48:59.047
# My little star up high
Dazzling my eyes

01:48:59.256 --> 01:49:05.058
# Shining brightly

01:49:05.262 --> 01:49:09.255
# Falling on my shoulders

01:49:09.433 --> 01:49:13.494
# Don't be sad anymore

01:49:13.670 --> 01:49:21.099
# Holding my hands tightly
Caressing my wound

01:49:21.311 --> 01:49:28.877
# It embraces me warmly

01:49:29.619 --> 01:49:37.788
# Too hurt for my legs to walk

01:49:37.995 --> 01:49:43.456
# Eyes so blurry with tears

01:49:43.633 --> 01:49:48.772
# Before love
Never meant for me

01:49:48.807 --> 01:49:52.902
# I will keep on smiling

01:49:53.076 --> 01:49:56.380
# Dear moments with you

01:49:56.415 --> 01:50:06.881
# Buried deep in my heart

01:50:07.057 --> 01:50:12.689
# Like those stars
embroidered in my eyes

01:50:14.498 --> 01:50:16.523
Look at you.

01:50:17.334 --> 01:50:19.996
Your undershirt shows.

01:50:29.946 --> 01:50:31.641
Can you tell?

01:50:31.815 --> 01:50:32.713
No.

01:50:33.150 --> 01:50:35.584
No, you can't.

01:50:37.354 --> 01:50:40.653
Dad, I really didn't know.

01:50:45.095 --> 01:50:46.562
Sang-jun, I love this.

01:50:53.303 --> 01:50:58.036
# Like those stars
embroidered in my eyes

01:50:58.842 --> 01:51:03.609
# I will love you forever

01:51:12.656 --> 01:51:15.158
<i>"A Shocking Confession
Jenny was a fake!"</i>

01:51:15.193 --> 01:51:19.595
<i>Jenny went down like that.
Completely.</i>

01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:27.093
<i>But Hanna made it.</i>

01:51:28.305 --> 01:51:30.500
<i>How? Beats me.</i>

01:51:31.441 --> 01:51:35.011
Lower it a bit.
Make it lower.

01:51:35.046 --> 01:51:36.146
That's nice.

01:51:36.181 --> 01:51:39.116
It's cool, isn't it?

01:51:39.151 --> 01:51:40.447
Leave!

01:51:41.251 --> 01:51:42.582
It's cool.

01:51:42.853 --> 01:51:48.519
<i>She's got more fans now.
More anti-fans, too.</i>

01:51:48.892 --> 01:51:50.086
Hey!

01:51:51.194 --> 01:51:53.788
"A pig"? I'll kill you!

01:51:54.431 --> 01:51:55.796
Stay away from me!

01:51:55.966 --> 01:51:59.469
<i>I don't think
she likes me anymore.</i>

01:51:59.504 --> 01:52:00.770
I'm doing my best.

01:52:00.805 --> 01:52:05.434
Your best isn't enough.
Doing well is what counts.

01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:09.105
<i>I don't wanna admit it...</i>

01:52:09.412 --> 01:52:12.382
<i>...but people say
I like her more now.</i>

01:52:12.417 --> 01:52:14.748
What do you like about her?

01:52:16.419 --> 01:52:17.977
I don't know.

01:52:21.191 --> 01:52:22.886
Because she's pretty?

01:52:25.395 --> 01:52:28.125
Assholes like you
would say so.

01:52:31.301 --> 01:52:32.928
Because she's innocent?

01:52:33.737 --> 01:52:38.037
Assholes like me
would say so.

01:53:53.917 --> 01:53:56.010
I'm the famous Dr. Lee,

01:53:56.186 --> 01:53:58.711
known as Hand of God.

01:53:59.489 --> 01:54:02.322
I might win the next
Nobel Prize.

01:54:08.498 --> 01:54:11.729
What do you want fixed?

01:54:12.869 --> 01:54:14.302
My whole body.

01:54:18.575 --> 01:54:19.769
Your whole body?
