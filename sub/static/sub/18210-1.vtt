WEBVTT

00:38.506 --> 00:41.342
Sheriff Boone.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.213
They said you were
the one to call.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.642
BOONE:
What are they

01:49.109 --> 01:51.479
Satanists?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.650
Amateurs.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.739
Sheriff, I need your light.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.810
What are you doing?

02:22.843 --> 02:24.779
No wonder this didn't work.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.749
What didn't work?

02:29.817 --> 02:32.887
Well, they summoned
something,

02:32.920 --> 02:35.322
but they couldn't hold it.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.428
Light, Sheriff.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.764
Light!

02:48.436 --> 02:50.805
Well, that's not good.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.416
Who are you?

03:01.449 --> 03:03.718
It's all right.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.786
It's all right.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.689
Come here.

03:08.723 --> 03:10.425
Oh.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.496
Oh, you are
something special.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.734
Those idiots didn't know
what to do with you, did they?

03:19.767 --> 03:21.736
That's all right.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.471
It's okay.

03:24.739 --> 03:26.741
I know all about you.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.511
I know where you're from.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.881
I know what you need.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.851
May I show you something?

03:36.884 --> 03:38.753
Don't be scared.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.821
Here.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.894
A pretty crown
for a pretty princess.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.663
Hmm?

03:51.599 --> 03:53.400
I want to help you...

03:54.502 --> 03:56.504
because you...

03:56.937 --> 03:58.773
are... perfect.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.410
There.

04:05.780 --> 04:07.648
Now we can be friends.

04:28.903 --> 04:30.938
Tell me what you want.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.608
You know what I want.
Say it.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.646
Mmm.
Look at me.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.716
Look at me, slut!

04:43.984 --> 04:45.820
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.955
It's fine. Whatever!
Oh, no. God. I'm sorry.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.057
Hey, it's cool.
It's fine.
No.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.059
Slut is cool.
I can do slut.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.961
Okay, ready?
I don't know. Okay.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.831
Take two.
Okay.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.502
Mmm. Oh, no,
no, no, no, no.

05:01.536 --> 05:04.071
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
It's like--

05:04.104 --> 05:06.574
This is why
we can't role-play.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.976
Am I supposed to be me?
Yeah. You're you.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.979
You're, like,
a slut, right?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.881
Um--

05:15.015 --> 05:17.718
Sorry. I don't know.

05:17.752 --> 05:20.955
God, can't we just
be Jonah and Eva?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.790
Eva's who I want.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.860
I know. I just wanted to
make sure you remembered
that this weekend.

05:25.893 --> 05:29.096
Of course I will.
You know I want you
to have fun. I do.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.799
Strippers are one thing.
Who said anything
about strippers?

05:31.832 --> 05:34.669
I did, and I say they're fine.
Get some ones, some fives.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.004
Put a few girls
through college.
Everybody wins.

05:37.037 --> 05:40.107
Just stay away
from the seedy dives.
The seedy dives?

05:40.140 --> 05:44.011
The ones where the girls
don't really want to be there.
Oh, God, Eva.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.881
No, I'm not into
that kind of stuff.
You know me.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.316
I do.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.819
I also know
your brother.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.889
Heads up, pussies!
We gotta lay down
some ground rules.

05:54.922 --> 06:00.761
Rule number one:
no texting or calling
girlfriends/fiancÃ©es

06:00.795 --> 06:03.030
once we make landfall,
all right?

06:03.063 --> 06:06.934
This is dude time.
We don't want anything getting
back to the bride-to-be.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.704
I've seen that shit happen,
and it's brutal.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.806
Yo, earbuds out.
Oh, what's up?

06:11.839 --> 06:13.808
Come on, man.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.343
Matter of fact, everyone
give me their cell phones.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.912
-Hey, come on!

06:17.945 --> 06:20.781
Please, watch the road.
Please don't kill me.

06:20.815 --> 06:21.816
Relax.

06:21.849 --> 06:25.119
I don't want you guys
sending out any damn tweets,

06:25.152 --> 06:28.823
get my main man in trouble
while he's trying to
get his freak on.

06:28.856 --> 06:33.127
Rule number two:
we say yes.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.997
We don't say maybe.
We don't say, "Gee,
I don't know. I've never--"

06:37.031 --> 06:40.000
And we damn sure
don't say no.

06:40.034 --> 06:43.070
Say yes to living

06:43.103 --> 06:45.205
and yes
to living it up!

06:45.239 --> 06:47.642
Do you feel me?
Yes!

06:47.675 --> 06:49.944
Yes.
Gee, I don't know.
I never

06:49.977 --> 06:52.112
That's it.
Whatever happened
to Vegas?

06:52.146 --> 06:56.784
Vegas is shit, man.
It's hot as balls, and
it smells like hot balls.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.687
Trust me, Garden City
is where we want to be.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.122
See that?
That's the spot.

07:02.156 --> 07:04.692
Hottest place
on the East Coast, baby!

07:04.725 --> 07:07.928
Let's light this up!
Whoo-hoo!

07:11.165 --> 07:15.069
-This place sucks.
-Uh, no, it's okay.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.071
She's wearing flip-flops.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.973
I almost forgot.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.709
Got some groomsmen's gifts
for you guys.
What?

07:21.742 --> 07:23.678
Thanks for coming.
Such a Boy Scout.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.914
Love you.
Classic Jonah.
Always prepared.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.983
Oh, cool.
You hate 'em.
No, I don't.

07:29.016 --> 07:32.853
Yeah, you do.
You never know when you need
to open a tiny bottle of beer.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.889
Stop. You know what?
We love them.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.124
Thank you, Jonah.
Don't we?

07:37.157 --> 07:41.195
I love it, Jonah.
-Let's drink till they're hot.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.972
I know, man.
It should have been you.
What? No.

07:52.006 --> 07:53.908
Hey, look, I wouldn't
want the responsibility.

07:53.941 --> 07:56.844
I want you to have it.
You are my best man.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.146
You are. See, this
is the difference.

07:59.179 --> 08:02.282
When I tell you I had
to pick Mac over you,
you get it.

08:02.316 --> 08:06.153
If I were to tell him I'm
picking you over my brother,
he'd never let it go.

08:06.186 --> 08:10.190
It's fine. Who cares?
How are you feeling?
You ready for next week?

08:10.224 --> 08:12.026
Oh, yeah. I feel great.

08:12.059 --> 08:15.763
I mean, I'm not nervous,
but that kind of makes me
nervous, you know?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.732
Does that make sense?
It's gonna be fine, buddy.

08:17.765 --> 08:18.766
Yeah?
Yeah.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.467
Hey, big boy.
How 'bout a dance?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.303
You know what?
He would love one.
I got it.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.039
Okay.
Enjoy, my man.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.808
Thank you.
Oh, here?

08:27.842 --> 08:29.309
Okay.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.246
It's kind of like
I'm not really feeling
anything right now.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.249
-I feel like I should
be feeling something.
-I guess so. Yeah.

08:35.282 --> 08:39.053
What if I'm actually nervous,
but I put all my emotions
on mute or something,

08:39.086 --> 08:42.756
so I can get through it,
and I wake up in a year
or a month,

08:42.789 --> 08:44.992
and I realize I'm trapped,
and I totally freak out?

08:45.025 --> 08:48.195
No way, man. Eva's awesome.
It's gonna be great.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.031
You two are perfect
for each other.
She's the best.

08:51.065 --> 08:53.868
Yeah, it's disgusting.
Yeah, I love her.

08:53.901 --> 08:57.772
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's alcohol abuse.
Don't spill it.

08:59.874 --> 09:01.842
Yo, brother.
It's declined.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.980
All right.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.750
Use that one.

09:09.784 --> 09:11.819
I'll take another one.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.090
Bullshit, isn't it?

09:16.123 --> 09:17.925
Excuse me?

09:17.958 --> 09:20.961
The club.
Can read it on your face.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.230
Yeah, well, stop
reading my face.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.971
Sorry. It's just--
You hear all these stories
about Garden City.

09:31.005 --> 09:33.073
It's supposed to be
the greatest underground
party scene.

09:33.107 --> 09:36.143
There's nothing here
I couldn't see in Tampa.

09:36.176 --> 09:39.246
My baby brother's
getting married next week,
and I'm the best man.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.015
I have to deliver.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.749
I hear you.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.320
Look, I know a place.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.089
I'm talkin'... a place.

09:49.123 --> 09:51.225
This thing
is drippin' with pussy.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.260
The music's amazing.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.262
The vibe...

09:55.295 --> 09:58.833
makes this place look
like fucking Sunday school.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.234
I can probably
get you in.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.771
But only
if you and your boys
are serious.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.342
Or you can stay here,

10:08.375 --> 10:10.210
drink that bottle,

10:10.244 --> 10:12.146
go home and pass out

10:12.179 --> 10:17.784
and in your drunken dreams
maybe come close
to things I've seen.

10:21.088 --> 10:25.025
A toast to Jonah.
All right? Man of the hour.

10:25.059 --> 10:27.394
And lamb
for the slaughter.

10:27.427 --> 10:32.066
He's younger than me,
he's less handsome,
much thinner penis.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.001
That's not true.
Don't interrupt.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.302
It's not.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.172
But in spite of all that,

10:38.205 --> 10:40.107
you're movin' on up, man.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.210
And you're marrying up.
God, she's got money.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.045
You're surpassing me, Bro.

10:45.079 --> 10:48.916
You're making
an honest woman
out of Eva

10:48.949 --> 10:50.250
and a man out of yourself.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.888
ALL: Cheers.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.358
Mmm!
Thank you.

10:58.392 --> 11:00.861
Yes, sir.

11:00.895 --> 11:03.330
And that concludes
the opening ceremonies.
What?

11:03.363 --> 11:07.001
Oh, no. No, no.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.436
Here we go.
That's for you.
'Shrooms.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.639
Yup.
Like an old friend.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.909
Yeah.
Thank you, sir.

11:14.942 --> 11:18.145
-Wow.
-Mmm!

11:19.446 --> 11:23.017
See this Wyatt Earp
son of a bitch here
at the end of the bar?

11:23.050 --> 11:25.886
-Says he can show us
to the real Garden City.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.122
There's this club.
It's very underground.
He's going there now.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.925
He says
we can follow him.
Uh, no?

11:30.958 --> 11:33.660
We don't say no.
Rule number two: no "nos."

11:33.693 --> 11:35.462
Rule number four:

11:35.495 --> 11:39.366
Always trust a dude
with a dick duster
on his face like that.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.936
It's a con.
You think so?

11:41.969 --> 11:43.971
Yes.
Then we vote.

11:44.004 --> 11:48.909
Look, if you guys came here
with a matching set of sack,

11:48.943 --> 11:52.379
and you came here to do
what you came here to do,
then you seize your destiny,

11:52.412 --> 11:55.249
show your support,
gobble that mushroom down
like a Mario brother.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.918
I already did mine. No.
Rand's in. Yeah.

11:57.952 --> 12:00.254
-Actually, I'm kind of tired.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.257
You can be tired
when you're married
and Eva's fat.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.526
How 'bout it, Duncan?
I'm the designated driver.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.295
We'll cab it.
Don't worry about it.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.065
I'm not leaving my car
here in this shady-ass
strip mall.

12:11.098 --> 12:15.435
-As long as we get there
in 30 minutes, we're fine.
-All right. I'm into it.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.471
Oh! Nice!
Yes!

12:17.504 --> 12:20.074
Attaboy.
I think I took two.

12:20.107 --> 12:23.210
-Jonah! Jonah! Jonah!
-Jonah! Jonah!

12:23.243 --> 12:26.280
I've never 'shroomed!
Really?
Jonah! Jonah!

12:28.382 --> 12:31.918
-Yes! Attaboy!

12:33.453 --> 12:36.290
DUNCAN: How far away
is this place?

12:36.323 --> 12:38.525
MAC: He said it's hard
to tell sometimes.

12:38.558 --> 12:42.429
It's hard to tell?
Why?

12:42.462 --> 12:45.032
It moves.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.467
What the hell
does that mean?

12:47.501 --> 12:50.437
How you holding up?
You got ten minutes
or so, man.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.372
Seen any colors yet?
I see red.

12:52.406 --> 12:54.374
Taillights.

12:54.408 --> 12:57.077
That's it.
There's nothing else
out here, man.

12:57.111 --> 12:59.146
-Man, this is a bad idea.
-Yeah, Mac.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.281
We should probably
just turn around.
Oh, come on.

13:01.315 --> 13:04.318
Jonah is the man
of the night. We should
listen to Jonah.

13:04.351 --> 13:07.187
Jonah says go,
so let's go.
He just said turn around.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.489
Jonah said go.
I'm speaking for Jonah.
Jonah says go.

13:09.523 --> 13:12.459
We don't even know
where this place is.
RAND: Really, man.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.262
He's turning. Follow him.
Right there, right there.

13:17.164 --> 13:21.268
-DUNCAN: He's gonna kill us all,
and it's gonna be your fault.
-RAND: Just relax.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.971
This guy has us
on a dirt road, man.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.047
MAC: Where the hell are we?
I love it.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.215
RAND: We're out in the woods.
That's for certain.

13:35.249 --> 13:38.285
DUNCAN: Only good things
happen in the woods.
Everybody knows that.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.055
Arbor Day. Arbor Day
happens in the woods.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.490
MAC: What is this guy doing?

13:43.523 --> 13:46.993
-DUNCAN: Now he just turned off.
-RAND: Don't lose him.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.031
Shit.
Oh, shit.

14:25.132 --> 14:28.135
Welcome to
50 North, 40 West.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.043
Are you guys coming?

14:37.677 --> 14:40.147
After you.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.593
Brought you
some new friends.

14:53.627 --> 14:56.130
Boys, step inside.

15:29.263 --> 15:32.499
**

17:11.397 --> 17:13.300
Hey.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.635
You all right, man?

17:15.669 --> 17:19.772
I'm messed up, man.
This place is messed up.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.608
Yeah, it is!

17:38.758 --> 17:44.831
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have some first-timers
with us here tonight!

17:44.864 --> 17:47.401
They're here for
a very special occasion,

17:47.434 --> 17:52.406
and that calls for
some very special treatment.

17:52.439 --> 17:55.575
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your paws together.

17:55.609 --> 17:59.413
Happy stag party!

17:59.446 --> 18:02.582
-Jonah!

18:05.585 --> 18:08.722
Did you set this up?
Don't look at me, man.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.525
No. Look at me.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.760
Gentlemen, welcome.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.363
Thank you so much for coming.
I'm the proprietor.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.632
You can call me Nyx.

18:20.334 --> 18:25.271
Coming up next,
the lovely Miss Tauren!

18:27.407 --> 18:31.745
You boys... are with me.

18:39.586 --> 18:43.323
So, Jonah, we have worlds
of experiences here.

18:43.357 --> 18:45.759
What's your particular
flavor of poison?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.727
Um--
Who's the best man?

18:47.761 --> 18:49.663
Here.
What's he want?

18:49.696 --> 18:51.665
Something wild.
Mm-hmm.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.333
And private.
All right.

18:53.367 --> 18:55.101
But no sex.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.338
No sex, as in the act,
or no sex, as in no gender?

18:58.372 --> 19:00.874
Uh... the act.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.677
He's getting married
next week.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.345
Got it.

19:05.379 --> 19:06.780
I have just the thing.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.683
Gentlemen,
come right on in.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.618
Make yourselves comfortable.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.689
Money is no object.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.425
NYX :
Well, of course it is.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.460
That's all it is.

19:20.494 --> 19:24.464
And what are objects,
ultimately, but worthless?

19:24.498 --> 19:29.703
But what in this world
has worth?

19:29.736 --> 19:31.871
Experience!

19:31.905 --> 19:34.974
Experience.

19:35.008 --> 19:38.512
And experiences
are what I deal in.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.347
So you're saying
there's no charge?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.150
Now, did I say that?

19:48.988 --> 19:51.157
All right.
You ready to do this?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.660
Sure.
All right!

19:53.693 --> 19:56.496
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

19:56.530 --> 19:58.532
This is just for Jonah.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.967
This is a private show.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.871
The more men in the room,
the more diluted the experience.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.173
Hmm?
I don't know.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.178
JONAH: Mm-mmm.
Are you married?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.981
No.
Not yet, technically.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.750
So do it for us.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.885
Do it for me.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.754
Yeah, what do you say?

20:20.787 --> 20:24.558
They buy the ticket,
you take the ride.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.464
Hmm

20:30.497 --> 20:33.433
-Hold this for me.

20:33.467 --> 20:36.903
-Yeah!
-Hey. Keep your pants on.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.772
Yeah.

20:38.805 --> 20:42.408
You ready for a peek
behind door number one?

20:43.877 --> 20:45.912
And away we go.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.414
Have fun.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.519
Sh--

21:46.773 --> 21:48.474
Can you see me?

22:02.021 --> 22:04.490
Now we talk payment.

22:05.925 --> 22:10.764
I want... the fondest
memory of your mother

22:10.797 --> 22:12.599
from each of you.

22:13.867 --> 22:14.934
All of you.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.538
Now, you give me that,

22:18.572 --> 22:22.876
and Jonah will have a night
he will never forget.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.944
I'm-I'm sorry.

22:24.978 --> 22:28.915
You want us to tell you
about the best time we had
with our mothers?

22:28.948 --> 22:31.685
No. I want
the memory of it.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.787
It won't take
but a moment.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.990
The most beautiful
part about it is,
you won't even miss it.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.593
You can't miss a memory
you can't even remember.

22:39.626 --> 22:42.596
That's right.

22:42.629 --> 22:45.599
Do we have a deal?

22:45.632 --> 22:48.534
Deal. Yeah. Okay.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.940
Sure.

22:55.642 --> 22:58.645
All right, gentlemen,
I'm gonna need you all

22:58.678 --> 23:00.179
to look at your shoes.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.948
What?

23:03.116 --> 23:05.952
Look... at your shoes.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.957
What am I lookin' for?

23:12.091 --> 23:14.828
Go on.
Look at your shoes.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.835
Look... down.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.943
Look down...

23:31.144 --> 23:32.912
and think of Mother.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.855
And we're done.

23:44.223 --> 23:47.193
That's it?
That's it!

23:47.226 --> 23:52.098
Paid in full! Go on.
Have a great evening!

23:52.131 --> 23:54.834
Come on.
Get out of here.
Scat!

23:54.868 --> 23:57.971
Can I get a receipt
or something?
Get the fuck out!

23:58.004 --> 23:59.639
Okay.

24:05.979 --> 24:09.783
I'm sorry. Am I supposed
to do something?

24:09.816 --> 24:14.654
**

24:26.165 --> 24:28.634
**

24:49.723 --> 24:51.925
My parents are asleep.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.700
JONAH: Eva.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.969
Hit me.
We are paid in full.

26:10.003 --> 26:12.872
Okay? I want one
of them worm drinks
right there.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.943
-It's a leech.
-Leech drink.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.246
You're not scaring me.
Okay?

26:20.279 --> 26:23.182
I don't like it?
My funeral.

26:36.996 --> 26:39.966
-Murder.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.368
Hmm?

26:45.438 --> 26:47.874
Cheers.

26:50.877 --> 26:54.080
Nicely done, Duncan!

26:58.284 --> 27:00.186
Whoo!

27:05.124 --> 27:08.227
-No, I'm not tatted up.
-No, right here.

27:08.261 --> 27:11.865
Haven't seen that before.
No, hey, wait, wait.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.200
You got one too.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.371
Did you do this?

27:18.404 --> 27:21.207
What's the matter?
You don't remember?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.927
WOMAN: Don't go.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.264
Hello?

27:51.470 --> 27:53.940
Did you say something?

28:01.247 --> 28:03.016
Oh, shit.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.253
Hi. Hi. Can you hear me?

28:14.127 --> 28:18.064
Hey, are you--
are you okay in there?

28:19.298 --> 28:24.037
I mean, do--
do they have you locked up?
Can you get out?

28:25.972 --> 28:28.007
I'm a little high.

28:28.041 --> 28:30.276
That's maybe
a stupid question.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.213
Are you okay in there?

28:36.349 --> 28:38.284
Where are you?

28:45.191 --> 28:46.892
Shit.

28:48.962 --> 28:50.329
**

28:52.565 --> 28:55.068
-Aaah!

28:55.101 --> 28:56.469
Whoa!

28:56.502 --> 28:59.538
Dude! Shit.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.207
Bro.
Sorry.

29:02.308 --> 29:06.045
It's cool. Happens to
the best of us, man.

29:06.079 --> 29:08.547
I didn't mean to.
It's fine. Fine.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.984
It's cool.
I didn't mean to.

29:13.219 --> 29:16.255
RAND: Let's get, uh--
Let's get this
cleaned up, dude.

29:16.289 --> 29:18.157
Who was she?

29:19.058 --> 29:22.395
-Whoa, whoa!

29:22.428 --> 29:23.963
I--

29:23.997 --> 29:26.565
Jesus! Come on, man.

29:26.599 --> 29:30.469
Really? Grab this chair
over here, man.

29:30.503 --> 29:32.571
It's cool.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.307
MAC: Shit.

29:48.221 --> 29:51.124
Thank God, man.
We have overstayed
our welcome.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.059
I need you
to come with me.
What?

29:53.092 --> 29:56.229
-Come with me.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.566
-He puked.
-Take him to the car,
get it started.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.568
-Be ready to go.

30:02.601 --> 30:05.771
Just trust me.
What's going on?

30:05.804 --> 30:08.774
I'm about to do something
really stupid.

30:12.611 --> 30:16.982
Are you sure you know
where we're going?
Yeah, I counted the doors.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.290
Jonah. Jonah.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.359
What the hell
is this place?
Shh.

30:26.392 --> 30:29.028
MAN: I wasn't even
gonna come in, you know?

30:29.062 --> 30:31.364
Thought I'd go easy
tonight.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.268
It's meant to be,
you know?

30:35.301 --> 30:39.072
I got kind of lucky there.

30:39.105 --> 30:42.375
I get four.
Four hours, right?

30:43.676 --> 30:46.512
One for each of the boys
I brought in?

30:46.545 --> 30:48.314
New fish.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.517
Hey, you be sure
to tell him thank you
from me

30:51.550 --> 30:54.220
for letting me see
my baby again.

30:58.191 --> 31:00.126
Jonah. Jonah.
What is going on?

31:00.159 --> 31:01.494
There's a girl.
What?

31:01.527 --> 31:04.097
In a booth.
She's locked up.
No, locked in.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.399
So guys can't get
to her, right?

31:06.432 --> 31:09.668
Come on, man.
Elliot's sick, and I've seen
some... really weird shit.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.304
Give me your knife.
Why?

31:11.337 --> 31:13.206
Just give it to me!
Jonah, stop.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.308
This is like
sex trafficking
or something.

31:15.341 --> 31:18.411
Yeah. Of course, Mac
would bring us to a place
with sex trafficking.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.413
You had sex with her?
No.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.648
Then what happened?
I don't know really.

31:22.681 --> 31:25.318
She, uh-- She sang.

31:26.452 --> 31:29.322
What?
She sang, okay?
Just give me the knife.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.496
This is ridiculous.
What are they doing?

31:37.530 --> 31:39.432
I killed her.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.703
Who did you kill,
buddy?

31:44.737 --> 31:48.374
I don't know.
I don't know who she was.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.511
She was young.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.084
What'd they put
in that drink?

31:59.685 --> 32:02.121
Memories.

32:02.155 --> 32:03.322
New memories.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.163
Wh
What if it is
sex traffickers, huh?

32:10.196 --> 32:13.699
You know those type of people
you don't want to mess with?
It's sex traffickers.

32:13.732 --> 32:17.670
That's who, Jonah.
They're gonna know it's you.
That Nyx guy? He'll know.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.606
-We can't leave her here.
-Can't we make
an anonymous phone call?

32:20.639 --> 32:24.210
-I think she needs help, man,
like now and not later.
-This is crazy.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.212
Isn't that
what tonight's about?

32:26.245 --> 32:28.481
Right? It's the last hurrah
for crazy, right?

32:28.514 --> 32:32.185
We say yes.
Okay, tonight we say yes.

32:36.255 --> 32:38.457
Got it. Here. Here.

32:51.604 --> 32:55.774
Yes. Uh, hello.
We're here to rescue you.
Okay.

32:55.808 --> 32:58.644
Hey, you okay?

32:58.677 --> 33:02.515
You want my shirt?

33:04.217 --> 33:05.951
-Here you go.
-Come on. We need to leave.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.553
Hang on. Here you go.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.522
Take this.

33:09.555 --> 33:12.525
Here. You're okay.
Yeah, yeah. Here you go.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.327
There you go.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.264
You're fine.

33:18.297 --> 33:22.535
Here. Listen.
My name's Jonah.
This is Rand.

33:22.568 --> 33:25.671
We can take you out of here
if you want to go.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.473
Do you want to go?

33:27.506 --> 33:29.542
You do?
She wants to go.
Come on.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.444
Let's go.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.384
Which way?
I don't remember.

34:11.417 --> 34:15.588
I thought you said
you counted the doors.
It wasn't like this before.

34:15.621 --> 34:19.224
There's someone back here,
Jonah. Pick a way.
I don't know!

34:20.759 --> 34:22.728
She does.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.496
Let's go.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.266
Shit.

34:29.868 --> 34:33.739
-Shit! Hey! Hey, hey.

34:33.772 --> 34:37.376
It's cool, man.
We're trying to find a way
out of here. Can you help us?

34:39.312 --> 34:41.380
Look, you don't
have to do this.
Aaah!

34:42.715 --> 34:47.585
Take her, Jonah! Run!
-Whoa, whoa! Rand!

34:47.620 --> 34:49.322
Oh, my God!

34:50.088 --> 34:52.391
JONAH:
Stop it, please, please!

34:53.458 --> 34:55.628
-Stop it!

34:55.661 --> 34:57.330
That way!

35:14.580 --> 35:17.583
**

35:17.616 --> 35:21.354
Wait. What are you doing?
Can we worry about that
later, please?

35:21.387 --> 35:23.356
Bind.

35:23.389 --> 35:26.291
What?
Bind.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.537
What?

38:09.888 --> 38:12.525
What is taking so long?

38:14.593 --> 38:16.929
I should go back inside.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.864
He said
to meet us here.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.835
Yeah, but I want
another drink.

38:25.671 --> 38:27.740
-Open the door! Open it!
-Come on, dude.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.076
-He was with you!

38:31.109 --> 38:32.978
We got separated.
What the hell happened?

38:33.011 --> 38:36.782
There was a girl in the back.
She was locked up,
so we let her out.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.984
Thought she was there
against her will.

38:44.757 --> 38:47.793
Okay. We're out of here.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.998
-We gotta wait for Rand.

38:53.031 --> 38:56.034
We gotta wait for Rand!
Mac, we gotta wait for Rand.

38:56.068 --> 38:58.771
This isn't happening.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.739
Wait. Mac! Mac!
He's there, he's there!

39:04.810 --> 39:07.646
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go! Go, go, go!

39:09.582 --> 39:11.516
What the hell
is he laughing about?

39:12.818 --> 39:14.653
Is that your blood?
Are you okay?

39:14.687 --> 39:16.922
This is fucked.
This is fucked!

39:21.794 --> 39:23.796
What the hell
is going on?

39:23.829 --> 39:25.864
Where's the girl?
She's not a girl.

39:25.898 --> 39:28.801
She's not a girl, man.
She's something else.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.903
Like a transsexual?
That could be cool.

39:30.936 --> 39:33.906
No!
What do you mean,
"something else?"

39:39.211 --> 39:41.814
JONAH: Look out!

39:45.383 --> 39:47.820
Is everyone okay?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.822
RAND: Yeah. Shit.

39:51.123 --> 39:53.859
What's--
That's my jacket.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.795
Wait. Where's Elliot?
Elliot!

39:56.829 --> 39:58.831
Dude, he's alive.
He's alive.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.766
Elliot!

40:03.201 --> 40:05.103
Come on.

40:05.137 --> 40:06.171
Elliot!

40:08.206 --> 40:11.076
MAC: Shit!
What the hell is that?

40:11.109 --> 40:14.212
Oh, no!
Fuck! Fuck!

40:14.246 --> 40:17.816
Shit! There's a car coming!
Get it, get it!

40:17.850 --> 40:22.755
I'll flag 'em. I'll flag 'em.
Hey! Hey! Help! Please, stop!

40:22.788 --> 40:24.723
-Hey!
-Rand, look out!

40:25.858 --> 40:28.827
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
They're coming back.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.730
Let's go!
Everybody's dying!

40:31.764 --> 40:33.598
Then let's not!
Come on!

40:50.015 --> 40:51.717
Damn it.

40:54.286 --> 40:56.889
NYX: We're gonna need
that boy now.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.726
Luckily, we have
something that's his.

41:01.727 --> 41:04.897
Under the C-A-R.

41:09.902 --> 41:11.236
Oh.

41:11.269 --> 41:13.271
Well, hey there.

41:27.285 --> 41:29.788
Wait, wait.
Where are we going?

41:31.023 --> 41:33.759
You don't know either.
We're going this way,
Mac.

41:33.792 --> 41:36.762
So I can get
a signal on my phone
and call the police

41:36.795 --> 41:39.698
so I can tell them that
two of my friends are dead.

41:39.732 --> 41:43.101
-We don't know if that
one guy's actually dead.
His name is Rand!

41:43.135 --> 41:47.305
Rand! He's been my best friend
for, like, 15 years, and
you don't even know his name.

41:47.339 --> 41:51.009
Yeah, I do.
And Ra might not be dead!

41:51.043 --> 41:53.746
Well, we left him for dead.
You made me.

41:53.779 --> 41:56.815
-I saved you!

41:56.849 --> 41:59.317
"That one guy
might not be dead." Wow.

41:59.351 --> 42:02.788
-I'm trying to help.
-Oh. Well, thank you, Mac.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.758
Thank you so much for your help.
This has been so much fun.

42:05.791 --> 42:09.094
Thank you for taking
your dick out and swinging it
in front of everybody.

42:09.127 --> 42:12.831
And thanks for getting two of
my actual friends killed too.
Thank you for that.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.136
I didn't tell you
to mess with anything.

42:18.170 --> 42:21.506
-I didn't tell you to let
anyone out of any booth.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.975
Wait. Shut up.

42:23.008 --> 42:26.078
MAC: What is that?

42:40.058 --> 42:42.861
Shit!

42:43.896 --> 42:45.931
You okay?

42:48.266 --> 42:50.102
Come on.

42:50.135 --> 42:51.837
It smells like shit.

42:54.306 --> 42:56.108
Hold on.

42:57.275 --> 42:59.544
It's quicksand!
It's not quicksand.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.179
-I'm about to lose my shoe.
-Come on!

43:05.183 --> 43:06.885
What does she want?

43:08.386 --> 43:09.988
Me.

43:12.925 --> 43:15.260
When I let her
out of that booth,
she, like--

43:15.293 --> 43:17.562
she, like, sniffed me.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.866
That's why she took
Elliot-- 'cause he was
wearing my jacket.

43:20.899 --> 43:22.868
Why don't you lose
your clothes then?

43:22.901 --> 43:24.870
Come on, dude!
Stop it!

43:24.903 --> 43:28.841
-It's not the first time
I've seen your dick.
-It's not the clothes, dumb-ass.

43:28.874 --> 43:30.175
The clothes
smell like me.

43:36.949 --> 43:39.284
Oh, shit. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:39.317 --> 43:41.854
Great idea. Shit.

43:44.923 --> 43:46.992
Get down.
Oh, shit!

43:53.431 --> 43:55.800
Shh.

44:49.387 --> 44:52.891
Let's get back to the route.
If we follow it,
we can find someplace.

44:52.925 --> 44:55.160
How's your ankle?
Can you walk?

44:56.394 --> 44:58.997
No. But I can run.

45:03.368 --> 45:06.071
My--
Shit.

45:07.405 --> 45:09.207
Oh, shit.

45:23.989 --> 45:25.523
Who are you?

45:25.557 --> 45:27.259
Wh

45:28.460 --> 45:32.097
Who... are you?

45:32.130 --> 45:34.032
I'm, uh...

45:34.066 --> 45:37.069
I'm Rand. Wilson.
Rand Wilson.

45:38.103 --> 45:40.405
Who are you,
Rand Wilson?

45:40.438 --> 45:44.409
I'm n-- I'm nobody.
That's who you're going to be if
you don't answer my questions.

45:44.442 --> 45:47.379
What do you want
with the Lilith

45:47.412 --> 45:51.149
Who hired you?
Was it that prick Sharman
down in Panama City?

45:51.183 --> 45:54.286
No! I-I don't know anything
about that. Okay?

45:54.319 --> 45:57.255
I-I-I told you,
it was our friend Jonah.

45:57.289 --> 45:59.324
He was-- It was
his bachelor party.
Jonah.

45:59.357 --> 46:03.095
Yeah. And the man there,
he brought us here.
We followed him--

46:03.128 --> 46:05.363
You bought it all
with good memories

46:05.397 --> 46:10.235
so your friend Jonah
could spend some time with
one of my star attractions.

46:10.268 --> 46:14.172
That's great!
So why did he let her go?

46:14.206 --> 46:17.175
I don't know.
I don't know. Okay?
I-I don't--

46:17.209 --> 46:19.244
He thought you had her
locked up in there.

46:19.277 --> 46:24.216
I did have her locked up,
for some very good reasons,
as we have seen.

46:36.561 --> 46:38.463
Oh, thank God.

46:38.496 --> 46:40.598
Hey!
You okay, son?
No. No.

46:40.632 --> 46:43.368
I'm not okay, Officer.
No.

46:43.401 --> 46:47.139
His friend-- His--
Our friends are dead.

46:47.172 --> 46:50.008
There's someone
following us.
Hold on now.

46:50.042 --> 46:52.277
Who's following you?

46:52.310 --> 46:56.781
We went to this club
in the swamp, and--
The 50-something.

46:56.814 --> 46:59.117
And there was this guy...

46:59.151 --> 47:02.020
Hey, why don't you
get these boys some water.

47:02.054 --> 47:05.090
Just catch your breath.
Ma'am, a couple waters
for these boys.

47:05.123 --> 47:06.624
All right?
Yeah.

47:06.658 --> 47:09.161
And the check too, please.

47:09.194 --> 47:11.163
JONAH: It's some
satanist cult shit.

47:11.196 --> 47:13.165
They had these people
with robes.

47:13.198 --> 47:16.000
Had her locked up
in, like, a cage.

47:20.438 --> 47:22.474
We're busy.
Found 'em.

47:22.507 --> 47:26.278
Couple cops picked 'em up
at a diner on the edge of town.

47:26.311 --> 47:28.480
Well, what do you know
about that?

47:28.513 --> 47:32.117
Take 'em to the church.
Make everything ready.

47:34.119 --> 47:37.189
So that's really it?
That's all of it?
Mm-hmm.

47:37.222 --> 47:39.491
Just some failed
knight

47:39.524 --> 47:43.228
Yes, I s--
I swear to God, that's it.
That's it. Yes.

47:44.696 --> 47:47.099
Well, that does
make things easier.

47:47.132 --> 47:50.268
No. God, no. Please, wait.
Please don't. Please don't!

47:50.302 --> 47:53.638
I wouldn't move
if I was you.

47:53.671 --> 47:58.410
Now, you know, I think
you owe my associate
Barry here an apology.

47:58.443 --> 48:00.545
Because of your friend's
thoughtless actions,

48:00.578 --> 48:04.316
he now has a very deep,
personal family tragedy
to deal with.

48:04.349 --> 48:06.284
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay?
Tell him!

48:06.318 --> 48:10.588
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please. I j-- I wanna leave.
I wanna go home.

48:10.622 --> 48:12.424
I'm so sorry.

48:12.457 --> 48:15.460
We both know
your brother
is irreplaceable.

48:16.428 --> 48:19.297
Don't blame the Lilith.
Blame them.

48:19.331 --> 48:21.433
N-No, please.
I said I'm sorry.
I-I'm sorry.

48:21.466 --> 48:24.236
I'm sorry. Please.
I wanna go home.
Shh.

48:24.269 --> 48:26.571
What is he doing?
What are you doing?

48:26.604 --> 48:30.408
Well, um, he's gonna
hurt you for a while,
and I'm gonna watch.

48:30.442 --> 48:32.677
I told you
everything I know.
Okay?

48:32.710 --> 48:34.446
I believe you.
I know.

48:34.479 --> 48:36.448
Please! No!

48:36.481 --> 48:38.450
Please. Please stop.

48:38.483 --> 48:42.154
But you boys
stuck your hand
in the fire tonight,

48:42.187 --> 48:45.457
and it is my right
to see you get burned.

48:45.490 --> 48:47.325
Wh I don't...

48:47.359 --> 48:49.461
Why?

48:49.494 --> 48:51.529
'Cause you messed with
the wrong motherfucker.

48:57.202 --> 49:00.272
She took off into the woods.

49:00.305 --> 49:03.475
I don't know where she went.
But you guys
got away?

49:03.508 --> 49:07.612
Yeah. Well, we found the road.
This is the first place
that we saw.

49:07.645 --> 49:09.481
Are you boys
on something?

49:09.514 --> 49:14.152
No, we are not!
Yes! Take me to the station.
Just get me out of here.

49:14.186 --> 49:15.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jonah!

49:15.953 --> 49:18.423
Come on, man!
No! Come on.

49:18.456 --> 49:21.626
-Said take 'em to the church.

49:21.659 --> 49:24.629
Who said that? Wait!

49:24.662 --> 49:26.398
What the--

49:26.431 --> 49:28.633
They work for him!

49:28.666 --> 49:30.402
Up.

49:30.435 --> 49:32.337
Hey!

49:33.605 --> 49:35.640
Aaah! God!

49:35.673 --> 49:37.375
Go.

49:37.409 --> 49:40.212
No. No.

49:40.245 --> 49:44.516
**

49:49.621 --> 49:54.192
**

49:56.728 --> 50:00.164
**

50:20.818 --> 50:22.987
It killed him!

50:23.020 --> 50:26.224
(groaning, screaming,
muffled)

51:04.829 --> 51:06.498
I like you.

51:12.804 --> 51:14.639
I like you.

51:48.673 --> 51:50.675
Mac. Mac!

52:17.935 --> 52:21.573
(whimpering, screaming,
faint)

52:24.709 --> 52:26.911
Holy shit.

53:13.891 --> 53:15.627
Wait. Stop. No, please.

53:36.514 --> 53:39.817
**

53:47.792 --> 53:50.762
**

53:57.869 --> 53:59.604
JONAH:
Eva.

54:00.738 --> 54:02.674
Eva.

55:16.781 --> 55:18.215
Jonah!

55:22.119 --> 55:25.489
Wow. You guys really
did a number on him.

55:26.023 --> 55:27.992
I want all of it.

55:28.025 --> 55:30.995
Every blow,
every scream,

55:31.028 --> 55:33.865
every drop of piss
in his pants.

55:33.898 --> 55:37.501
Let's give Jonah something
to really think about, hmm?

55:37.969 --> 55:39.704
You got it.

55:50.047 --> 55:52.717
Rand.

55:53.918 --> 55:56.087
Look down.

55:56.120 --> 55:58.322
Now, bear with us.

55:58.355 --> 56:01.959
In a moment you won't even
recall the worst of it.

56:17.742 --> 56:18.943
Got it.

56:37.629 --> 56:39.563
See that he gets it.

56:40.397 --> 56:42.767
Don't leave until
you're sure he has.

57:16.734 --> 57:18.069
Eva?

57:18.102 --> 57:21.105
Shit. I shouldn't have called.
I interrupted your party.

57:21.138 --> 57:24.041
No. No, no. Actually,
I really need to hear
your voice right now.

57:25.042 --> 57:26.678
Are you okay?

57:26.711 --> 57:28.980
Um, yeah.
It's stupid. I just...

57:29.013 --> 57:32.116
I had this dream
that I couldn't find you.

57:32.149 --> 57:33.985
When I woke up,
you weren't here.

57:34.018 --> 57:36.854
I even went to look
for you in the kitchen.

57:36.888 --> 57:41.793
Then I just got
this bad feeling,
like I needed to talk to you.

57:41.826 --> 57:44.628
I really want to talk
to you right now too.

57:45.262 --> 57:48.265
I don't know if I--
if I can right now.

57:48.299 --> 57:50.167
Jo-- Jonah--
Hello?

57:50.201 --> 57:53.738
Can you
You're-- reaking up--
Ar-- you ther--

57:53.771 --> 57:56.640
Listen, listen.
Uh, something happened.

57:57.274 --> 57:59.110
Elliot?

57:59.143 --> 58:01.846
He's dead.
And-- And Rand, he's--

58:01.879 --> 58:03.915
EVA: Are you there?
Hello--

58:03.948 --> 58:05.683
Goddamn it.

58:06.918 --> 58:09.821
Eva, listen to me.
I don't know
if you can hear me.

58:09.854 --> 58:12.724
But, um, my phone's
about to die,

58:12.757 --> 58:15.126
and I just want
to tell you
that I love you.

58:15.159 --> 58:17.028
I love you so much.

58:17.061 --> 58:19.163
That's scary.
What did you do?

58:19.196 --> 58:21.665
Nothing. No, um--

58:22.299 --> 58:25.937
I just... really
wanted to say it.

58:28.806 --> 58:33.177
There's no place
in the world I'd rather be
than home with you right now.

58:33.210 --> 58:34.846
EVA: Are you the--

58:34.879 --> 58:36.080
Hello?

59:50.387 --> 59:52.756
-What--

59:53.858 --> 59:55.893
Get the hell outta here!

59:57.394 --> 59:59.096
Brought you a drink.

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:03.134
I'm not thirsty.
I'm not patient.

01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:06.770
I was supposed to be
off work two hours ago.

01:00:07.839 --> 01:00:09.941
So you gonna drink that
or not?

01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:11.976
-Because if not--

01:00:12.009 --> 01:00:14.211
I'm supposed to kill you.

01:00:15.312 --> 01:00:17.181
Okay. Okay.

01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:21.953
All right.

01:00:34.866 --> 01:00:37.201
Good boy.

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:46.878
God!

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:48.946
JONAH: No!

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:52.183
-'Cause you messed with
the wrong motherfucker.
-No, wait! Please!

01:00:58.022 --> 01:01:01.625
Jonah? Jonah, are you--

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.195
There you are. Hi, Jonah.

01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:07.131
Well, as you can feel--
or remember feeling--

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:10.067
I've obviously put Rand
into a great deal of pain.

01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:12.103
Now, he's not dead.
Not yet.

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:14.939
But that can change,
and will,

01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:16.373
if we can't make a deal.

01:01:16.407 --> 01:01:18.409
So, you have my girl,

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:21.012
and I obviously have
your man.

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:24.215
So let's make a trade, hmm?

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:26.117
No games, no tricks.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:29.220
Everybody can walk away
with what they want.

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:32.323
My associate will give you
all the details,

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:36.060
and, uh,
I'll be seeing you soon.

01:01:37.428 --> 01:01:39.130
Toodle-oo.

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:46.938
Shit. He wants
to make a trade.

01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:49.140
It's your choice, man.
I'm just the messenger.

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:53.210
But that girl,
I don't have her.
She's not with me.

01:01:53.244 --> 01:01:56.880
She's following you.
Taking you to him
is as good as taking her.

01:02:05.456 --> 01:02:07.891
Then take me to him.

01:02:09.126 --> 01:02:10.361
Yes, sir.

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:41.092
Ticktock, Jonah.
Your old friend's inside.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:44.228
And I don't wanna be here
when the new one shows up.

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:56.040
NYX: My, my. Hell is empty
and the devils are all here.

01:02:57.241 --> 01:03:00.444
-You look horrible.

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:02.279
No hello

01:03:02.313 --> 01:03:04.181
Rude.

01:03:04.215 --> 01:03:07.118
Come on.
I'll take you to him.

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:10.954
So she didn't catch you?

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.325
Ha-ha-ha! She did!

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:18.395
Well, you don't look
too worse for wear.
That's somethin'.

01:03:18.429 --> 01:03:20.164
I mean, she likes you.

01:03:21.265 --> 01:03:23.467
That means
you've been chosen.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.469
You know,
they mate for life.

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:27.338
We'll use that.

01:03:27.371 --> 01:03:30.374
You didn't have to hurt Rand.
You coulda just brought me here.

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:35.012
No, I didn't have to.
I was willing to, and I did.
Don't forget that.

01:03:35.046 --> 01:03:37.381
Just do what you're told,
Jonah,

01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:42.453
and you'll be banging away
at Mrs. Jonah
by suppertime tomorrow.

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:45.056
Defy me,

01:03:45.089 --> 01:03:48.225
and your boy Rand
gets a bullet in the brain

01:03:48.259 --> 01:03:50.294
he'll be thinking about
forever.

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:57.000
What is this?

01:03:58.269 --> 01:04:02.073
Think of it like
a shock collar for dogs,
except for her kind.

01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:04.041
Helps prevent incidents
like this evening.

01:04:04.075 --> 01:04:05.576
Keeps her in line,

01:04:05.609 --> 01:04:08.379
makes her more susceptible
to suggestion.

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:12.015
No, no, no, no.
That's for you.
You're going to put it on her.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:16.153
-Yes.

01:04:16.187 --> 01:04:17.354
You.

01:04:17.388 --> 01:04:20.357
Why do you think
I brought you here?

01:04:20.391 --> 01:04:22.226
She and I have a...

01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:26.063
complicated history.

01:04:26.097 --> 01:04:31.034
Besides, you're probably
the only one she trusts enough
to let get close.

01:04:31.602 --> 01:04:33.370
Magic?

01:04:35.606 --> 01:04:37.541
Sure.

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:39.310
Magic.

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:43.380
Like everything else
people like you
will just never understand.

01:04:43.414 --> 01:04:47.318
Now, when our little
transaction is complete,

01:04:47.351 --> 01:04:51.255
you and, uh, Mr. Gimpy
are free to go.

01:04:52.323 --> 01:04:55.192
Don't worry.
Won't be long.

01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:02.666
Rand! God, Rand.

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:06.170
Are you all right?
I'm so sorry, man.

01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:09.573
So sorry
for what they did to you.

01:05:09.606 --> 01:05:11.542
What did they do?

01:05:14.145 --> 01:05:16.480
What's up?
What'd you say
Jonah?

01:05:17.648 --> 01:05:20.184
What did they do to me?

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.289
Listen to me.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:30.494
I'm going home to Eva,
and I'm taking you with me.
All right?

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:32.163
Mmm.

01:05:32.196 --> 01:05:34.165
Mmm.
Yeah.

01:05:50.514 --> 01:05:53.217
** (humming
"Wedding March")

01:06:00.191 --> 01:06:01.458
JONAH: Rand!

01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:06.430
RAND: Jonah.
JONAH: Are you okay?

01:06:15.206 --> 01:06:17.208
What are you doing?

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:21.412
Lily!

01:06:26.517 --> 01:06:29.520
NYX:
Oh, here you are.

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:33.224
So pretty.

01:06:33.257 --> 01:06:35.292
Come on, Lily.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:38.429
Stand in the center.
Go on.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:41.298
Like it was
a long time ago.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:44.435
Lily.

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:48.572
Stand in the center,
or he dies.

01:06:50.707 --> 01:06:52.443
Come on now.

01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:54.445
That's right.

01:06:54.478 --> 01:06:55.712
Here we go.

01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:57.448
Good.

01:06:57.481 --> 01:06:59.550
You...

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:03.220
You were much younger then.
That made it a lot easier.

01:07:03.254 --> 01:07:05.289
You're up.

01:07:09.493 --> 01:07:11.262
RAND: No.

01:07:27.344 --> 01:07:30.213
I'm sorry.

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:33.817
I'm sorry.

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:37.488
You came here for me,
a-and it was a trap.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:40.457
I didn't know...

01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:43.560
what you were.

01:07:45.496 --> 01:07:47.230
What he was.

01:07:50.401 --> 01:07:52.469
I just wanna go home.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.474
Do you?

01:07:57.508 --> 01:08:00.311
NYX: She's a killer, Jonah.
You know that.

01:08:00.344 --> 01:08:02.546
Now put her back
where she belongs.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.615
She belongs to me.

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:07.384
Do it. Now.

01:08:07.418 --> 01:08:09.520
How 'bout we go home?

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:14.525
Both of us,
to our own homes.

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.495
Can we just leave it
at that?

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:22.399
You're wasting time.
Do it.

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:25.402
Do it now!

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:27.671
Okay?

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:54.430
-You...

01:08:54.465 --> 01:08:57.368
-are on my very last nerve.

01:08:57.401 --> 01:09:00.571
Now listen here.
We are gonna try this
one more time.

01:09:04.575 --> 01:09:07.578
-Good to see you, shithead.

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:11.314
-Get the fuck outta here.

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:14.618
You all right?
Yeah.

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:18.654
Here, take this.
All right.

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:20.357
Cut Rand loose.

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:25.429
MAC: Hurry!

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:28.465
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:04.535
Shit! Shit!

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:13.376
You circus freak.

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:15.746
What?

01:10:15.779 --> 01:10:18.415
You hick piece of shit.

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:20.984
Eloquent.

01:10:30.694 --> 01:10:32.563
Come on, Jonah.

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:36.600
Don't go anywhere.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.638
Jonah! Run!

01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:46.777
No!

Cover your ears!

It's okay.
It's okay.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.732
It's okay.

01:12:15.766 --> 01:12:16.967
It's okay.

Don't go.

Oh, shit.

01:12:55.606 --> 01:12:57.674
Oh, no. No.

01:12:58.742 --> 01:13:00.677
Jonah,
we should leave.
It's okay.

Jonah!

Honey! Let's get
this special night started.
I'm sleepy.

come down here?

That's Eva.
