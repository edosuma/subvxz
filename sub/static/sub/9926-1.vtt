a new ad campaign
for a malt liquor division

in the African-American market.

the buying power

10:19.793 --> 10:21.272

of our junior executives.

don't hurt yourself.

01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:44.412
Oh, let the boy be.

01:02:44.456 --> 01:02:45.631
He's already wearing
more protection

01:02:45.674 --> 01:02:48.460
then they gave me
when I fought in the war.

01:02:48.503 --> 01:02:49.809
Oh!

01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:53.247
You're the pain
in the butt from
the barbershop.

01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:55.859
He must have heard
that somewhere.

01:02:55.902 --> 01:02:57.817
Hi, there, young man.

01:02:57.861 --> 01:03:00.254
I'm Lilly's grandfather.

01:03:00.298 --> 01:03:01.516
Hello, sir.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.692
I've been waiting
for a nice, strong young man

01:03:03.736 --> 01:03:05.259
to come and whisk Lilly away.

01:03:05.303 --> 01:03:07.087
Somebody did that already,
remember?

01:03:07.131 --> 01:03:09.960
She shouldn't be wasting
the next 25 years of her life

01:03:10.003 --> 01:03:12.092
taking care of no old man.

01:03:12.136 --> 01:03:13.920
No, she should go off

01:03:13.964 --> 01:03:16.967
and have a life
of her own.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.276
Cool!

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.756
Sammy Sosa.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.670
What do you say?

01:03:24.713 --> 01:03:26.454
He said cool.

01:03:26.498 --> 01:03:27.716
Dean?

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.631
Thank you.

01:03:29.675 --> 01:03:31.546
Look, Granddaddy.

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:33.244
I got Sammy Sosa.
Oh, okay.

01:03:33.287 --> 01:03:35.986
So have you changed
your mind about the choir?

01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:39.728
Why should I,
'cause you gave Dean a toy?

01:03:39.772 --> 01:03:43.297
No. Yes?

01:03:44.255 --> 01:03:46.561
Why is this so important to you?

01:03:46.605 --> 01:03:49.869
Because it's what
my Aunt Sally wanted me to do.

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:51.828
Every time I pack my bags
to leave,

01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:53.960
I get that image
of her helping my Mom out

01:03:54.004 --> 01:03:55.092
when I was little...

01:03:55.135 --> 01:03:56.963
and because
it was her last wish

01:03:57.007 --> 01:03:58.399
to get into the Explosion,

01:03:58.443 --> 01:04:01.228
and because...
And because you're
getting $150,000.

01:04:01.272 --> 01:04:04.710
I thought I'd finish
your sentence for you.

01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:07.060
That is the truth, right?

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:13.937
Yeah. Yes.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.852
Thanks for being honest,

01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:18.506
but I can't.

01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:20.813
You mean, I just told the truth
for nothing?

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:23.424
Thank you for the loan
yesterday.

01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:24.991
I know you want cash.

01:04:25.035 --> 01:04:29.561
You know, this truth stuff
is highly overrated.

01:04:29.604 --> 01:04:32.042
I don't care
who started it.

01:04:32.085 --> 01:04:33.826
You both should be ashamed.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:38.570
Okay, let's try it
once more from the top.

01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:41.703
Hey. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:42.791
I'm not doing this for you.

01:04:42.835 --> 01:04:44.532
The truth is I'm doing this
for Sally.

01:04:44.576 --> 01:04:47.187
Well, thank you anyway.

01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:52.714
Choir, I'd like you
to meet our new
soloist, Lilly.

01:04:52.758 --> 01:04:54.542
What's your last name?
Tramp.

01:04:54.586 --> 01:04:56.022
I knew this would happen.

01:04:56.066 --> 01:04:58.242
No-no-no, wait, wait,
wait, please, please.

01:04:58.285 --> 01:05:03.377
Let me handle this. Please.

01:05:03.421 --> 01:05:07.729
Have you forgotten
that Jesus loved
Mary Magdalene?

01:05:07.773 --> 01:05:08.948
She was a ho.

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:10.558
"Let him who is without sin

01:05:10.602 --> 01:05:12.082
cast the first stone."

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.170
Thank you for handling it.

01:05:13.213 --> 01:05:15.302
No, no, no, no, no,
I-I don't mean it.

01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:19.350
I'm just saying it
for effect. Please.

01:05:19.393 --> 01:05:20.960
[ sighs]

01:05:21.004 --> 01:05:22.179
It is your duty

01:05:22.222 --> 01:05:23.702
to help fallen women.

01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:25.051
I'm willing to help.

01:05:25.095 --> 01:05:26.705
Hi.
I agree.
It's about time

01:05:26.748 --> 01:05:29.012
we get some young Baptist booty
up in this choir.

01:05:29.055 --> 01:05:31.884
Ask her how come
she has to keep
so many husbands

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:35.322
away from their homes
down at that old sin
hole she be working at.

01:05:35.366 --> 01:05:38.586
DARRIN:
Would Aunt Sally
have been this harsh?

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:41.285
No, Sally would've
wanted Lilly to
stay in the choir...

01:05:41.328 --> 01:05:43.287
WOMAN:
Amen.
unlike some people.

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:44.723
Amen again.
MAN:
That's right.

01:05:44.766 --> 01:05:46.420
If she was a
respectable woman,

01:05:46.464 --> 01:05:47.944
she would have a
respectable job.

01:05:47.987 --> 01:05:50.729
The last thing we need
is another loose woman

01:05:50.772 --> 01:05:51.904
up in the choir stand.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.427
Now she should just
go on home, take care

01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:56.213
of that little
bastard baby...
Leave my son out of this.

01:05:56.256 --> 01:05:57.257
Talk to her. Tell her.

01:05:57.301 --> 01:05:58.955
Dean is a gift from God.

01:05:58.998 --> 01:06:00.043
So is snow and rain,

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:04.264
but we still have
to wear our rubbers.

01:06:04.308 --> 01:06:06.005
You know what Sally
told me once?

01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.093
She said,

01:06:07.137 --> 01:06:08.007
"When life makes you
have to put up

01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.313
"with mean and hateful people,

01:06:09.356 --> 01:06:10.705
"just think of them
as sandpaper.

01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:13.491
"They may scratch you,
rub you the wrong way,

01:06:13.534 --> 01:06:17.103
"but eventually...
you end up smooth and polished,

01:06:17.147 --> 01:06:18.626
"and the sandpaper--

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:22.108
it's just going to be
worn out and ugly."

01:06:23.849 --> 01:06:25.329
Lilly, you don't need
my help.

01:06:25.372 --> 01:06:28.506
Now if I could get
you all to sing
as well as you fight,

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:31.639
you'd be the baddest choir
in all of Georgia.

01:06:31.683 --> 01:06:32.640
Now, Lilly is a member

01:06:32.684 --> 01:06:34.860
of this choir
like everyone else.

01:06:34.903 --> 01:06:37.254
If you don't like it, well...

01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:38.646
you can just leave.

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:42.259
Oh, well that's my cue.

01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:46.611
Y'all coming?

01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:56.142
Uh, Paulina,
I thought you were leaving.

01:06:56.186 --> 01:06:58.884
The choir, yes,
but I'll stay in this church

01:06:58.927 --> 01:07:00.016
as long as I want.

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:01.495
I'm the treasurer.

01:07:01.539 --> 01:07:06.718
Fine. Fine. Then we'll rehearse
with Lilly as our lead.

01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:07.762
Watch it, bro.
Hey!

01:07:07.806 --> 01:07:10.330
Get down.
That's mine.
Right there.

01:07:10.374 --> 01:07:12.376
Aw, man!

01:07:12.985 --> 01:07:14.291
The Lord is good.

01:07:14.334 --> 01:07:15.988
[ all shouting
over one another]

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.859
The Lord bless you.

01:07:17.903 --> 01:07:20.340
Mr. Clean!

01:07:20.384 --> 01:07:23.082
liked church.
There's a hell
of a lot more action

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:24.736
than in the barbershop.

01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:26.520
Okay.

01:07:26.564 --> 01:07:28.696
Ready?

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:31.264
Do I come in on the upbeat
or the downbeat?

01:07:31.308 --> 01:07:34.180
Suit yourself. You're the pro.

01:07:34.224 --> 01:07:35.703
Try the downbeat, honey.

01:07:35.747 --> 01:07:39.968
I usually let the Neptunes
program on my upbeat, so...

01:07:40.012 --> 01:07:41.231
Let's try it again

01:07:41.274 --> 01:07:43.102
from the top.

01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:44.147
Aren't you going
to arrange us

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:45.278
for the performance?

01:07:45.322 --> 01:07:48.847
Right, right.
Lilly, Lilly, please, up.

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:50.109
Ladies, all three, up.

01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:51.850
Okay, Tasha,

01:07:51.893 --> 01:07:52.851
Tasha, please, down...

01:07:52.894 --> 01:07:55.114
and, uh... oh,
please, yes, Bessie,

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:56.507
Alma and Miss Stringer.

01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:59.945
Yeah, cute. Yes, yes,
there you go.

01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:03.209
Okay. Young and
foxy in the front

01:08:03.253 --> 01:08:05.124
and weird and funky
in the back...

01:08:05.168 --> 01:08:06.865
but we love you.

01:08:06.908 --> 01:08:08.910
All right. Ready?

Great! Yee-haw!

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:23.055
With a little more work,

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.578
I think we've got a real shot
at the Explosion.

01:08:24.622 --> 01:08:27.363
And after that,
maybe even a record deal.

01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:30.627
Then we'll tour on our own bus
with a clean bathroom.

01:08:30.671 --> 01:08:34.109
A tour? Girl, like
I'm going to leave
my granddaddy behind

01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:35.589

It saddens me
that the deadline

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:49.995
for entering the Gospel
Explosion has passed.

01:08:50.037 --> 01:08:51.170

Why didn't you say something?

You're the director

are your problem.

01:26:00.677 --> 01:26:04.855
I always thought she lost
contact with everyone here.

01:26:06.552 --> 01:26:10.687
1985.

01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:13.429
"Dear Sally, I think
this will be my big year.

01:26:13.472 --> 01:26:16.301
"We're settled
into our apartment

01:26:16.345 --> 01:26:17.259
and the rent is covered."

01:26:17.302 --> 01:26:21.045
She has "Thanks"
in parentheses.

01:26:21.088 --> 01:26:21.959
Sally.

01:26:22.002 --> 01:26:23.265
"Here's a picture of Darrin.

01:26:23.308 --> 01:26:26.181
Doesn't he look like
a future doctor or lawyer?"

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:28.792
This one was actually
addressed to you

01:26:28.835 --> 01:26:29.619
from Aunt Sally.

01:26:29.662 --> 01:26:31.273
It says "Return to Sender."

01:26:31.316 --> 01:26:34.363
It's because I moved
around a lot.

01:26:35.668 --> 01:26:37.670
[ laughs]:
Oh, my God.

01:26:37.714 --> 01:26:39.194
Not that funny.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.506
Dear Darrin,
I'm worried about you.

01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:50.683
All the different addresses
and phone numbers.

01:26:50.727 --> 01:26:52.511
The people calling here
looking for you.

01:26:52.555 --> 01:26:55.166
You seem to be lying
about who you are.

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:58.038
Why can't you accept
who you are?

01:26:58.082 --> 01:26:59.083
God accepts you.

01:26:59.126 --> 01:27:01.041
New York is so dangerous,

01:27:01.085 --> 01:27:03.783
criminals, crazy people,
and me

01:27:03.827 --> 01:27:05.916
if I have to come up there
and whip your ass.

01:27:05.959 --> 01:27:11.269
Up there acting like you ain't got no home training.

01:27:11.313 --> 01:27:12.749
It's my fault.

01:27:12.792 --> 01:27:17.275
I never should have let Paulina run your mom out.

01:27:17.319 --> 01:27:19.059
I love you, Darrin.

01:27:19.103 --> 01:27:21.105
I'm the only family you have,

01:27:21.148 --> 01:27:25.370
and you're the only
family I have.

01:27:25.414 --> 01:27:28.243
What does
the letter say?

01:27:28.286 --> 01:27:31.158
Something in my eye.

01:27:31.202 --> 01:27:32.551
What does the letter say?

01:27:32.595 --> 01:27:35.250
Oh, just stuff, stuff
I probably should have known.

01:27:35.293 --> 01:27:36.120
Let me see your eye.

01:27:36.163 --> 01:27:39.254
Huh? Oh.
Let me see your eye.

01:27:55.618 --> 01:27:58.838
She looks kind of disapproving.

01:28:00.579 --> 01:28:02.233
I can turn the
picture down.

01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:04.104
[ laughs]:
No.

01:28:04.148 --> 01:28:05.236
It's getting kind of late.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.934
I should go home
and check on my Dean.

01:28:07.978 --> 01:28:11.416
I should go home.
Yeah, let me walk you home.

01:28:15.464 --> 01:28:19.294
I love being back
in the choir.

01:28:19.337 --> 01:28:23.036
It's amazing how,
over the years,

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.125
the music has moved people,

01:28:25.169 --> 01:28:29.608
makes people feel better
about themselves, you know?

01:28:29.652 --> 01:28:30.435
Sure.

01:28:30.479 --> 01:28:31.915
Gospel music
moves people--

01:28:31.958 --> 01:28:34.352
people looking to be moved
and haven't figured out

01:28:34.396 --> 01:28:37.442
they're just a bunch
of old songs, anyway.

01:28:37.486 --> 01:28:39.357
You're so cynical.

01:28:39.401 --> 01:28:40.880
It gives people comfort.

01:28:40.924 --> 01:28:43.622
That's why my granddaddy
is not scared of dying.

01:28:43.666 --> 01:28:49.585
Simple, effective, comforting.
It must be nice.

01:29:03.642 --> 01:29:06.689
Simple isn't always wrong.

01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:09.256
Experience has taught me

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:11.998
that fighting temptation
makes you strong.

01:29:12.042 --> 01:29:14.174
Yes, but the trouble
with fighting temptation

01:29:14.218 --> 01:29:17.526
is you might not
get another chance.

01:29:17.569 --> 01:29:20.398
Oh, ye of little faith.

01:29:26.230 --> 01:29:29.668
What advertising agency?

01:29:31.757 --> 01:29:32.976
Oh.

01:29:33.019 --> 01:29:35.370
I'm afraid he's out.

01:29:35.413 --> 01:29:37.546
But I'm family.

01:29:37.589 --> 01:29:42.202
Uh-huh, you can
tell me everything

01:29:42.246 --> 01:29:46.424
and I'll give him the message.

01:29:46.468 --> 01:29:48.557
Uh-huh.

01:29:49.035 --> 01:29:50.863
Really?

01:29:50.907 --> 01:29:53.039
Oh.

01:30:00.307 --> 01:30:02.484
I'm on location
down here live

01:30:02.527 --> 01:30:05.356
at the Beulah Baptist
Church barbeque, mm-hmm.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.705
Folks down
at Polk's Funeral Home

01:30:06.749 --> 01:30:08.141
send their best wishes
to the choir

01:30:08.185 --> 01:30:11.318
and best of luck at the
Gospel Explosion next weekend.

01:30:11.362 --> 01:30:15.061
Polk's Funeral Home, make you
look good when you're dead.

01:30:15.105 --> 01:30:18.717
So good, they guarantee you
an open-casket funeral

01:30:18.761 --> 01:30:20.893
or the next one
is going to be free.

01:30:20.937 --> 01:30:22.765
See Darrin?

01:30:22.808 --> 01:30:23.983
Dean!

01:30:24.027 --> 01:30:25.463
Hey!

01:30:25.507 --> 01:30:26.551
Hey, what's up Dean?

01:30:26.595 --> 01:30:28.118
Hi, Lilly.

01:30:30.599 --> 01:30:33.340
I knew I could do it.
I want that one.

01:30:33.384 --> 01:30:35.778
Congratulations
to Willy Johnson's

01:30:35.821 --> 01:30:37.214
little boy, Bobby Johnson.

01:30:37.257 --> 01:30:39.477
He won
the rock-throwing contest.

01:30:39.521 --> 01:30:40.913
You want chicken?
You want chicken?

01:30:40.957 --> 01:30:41.523
Ribs.

01:30:41.566 --> 01:30:42.785
Oh, ribs, please.

01:30:42.828 --> 01:30:43.916
I don't know where that boy

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.570
learned how to throw
a rock like that at.

01:30:45.614 --> 01:30:46.745
Probably the one that

01:30:46.789 --> 01:30:48.617
broke the window
down at the radio station.

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:49.705
I ain't trying
to put that out there or nothing

01:30:49.748 --> 01:30:52.403
but somebody broke the window.

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:53.926
I ain't saying he did it,

01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:56.973
but he sure can throw a rock,
that's all I've got to say.

01:30:57.016 --> 01:30:58.278
Choir, choir!

01:30:58.322 --> 01:30:59.279
Yoo-hoo!

01:30:59.323 --> 01:31:00.498
Choir, gather around,

01:31:00.542 --> 01:31:01.586
I have great news.

01:31:01.630 --> 01:31:03.501
You'll be
happy to know

01:31:03.545 --> 01:31:05.242
that someone from
New York named Rosa

01:31:05.285 --> 01:31:09.072
called last night
with great news
about your job.

01:31:09.115 --> 01:31:10.290
She did?

01:31:10.334 --> 01:31:11.814
Oh, we got our
record deal already?

01:31:11.857 --> 01:31:14.120
No, no, no, he's
not a record producer.

01:31:14.164 --> 01:31:19.604
He's a junior level executive
at an advertising agency.

01:31:19.648 --> 01:31:21.780
But Rosa said
they are sorry
that they fired you

01:31:21.824 --> 01:31:24.000
and they want you
to come back.

01:31:24.043 --> 01:31:25.654
They're even willing
to overlook the fact

01:31:25.697 --> 01:31:27.525
that you faked
your high school diploma

01:31:27.569 --> 01:31:29.484
and your Yale degree.

01:31:29.527 --> 01:31:30.615
They're even willing

01:31:30.659 --> 01:31:32.312
to take care of your
credit card trouble,

01:31:32.356 --> 01:31:35.141
so there's no
evidence of fraud.

01:31:35.185 --> 01:31:36.839
Isn't that great news?

01:31:36.882 --> 01:31:39.972
What is she talking about,
Darrin?

01:31:41.147 --> 01:31:42.061
Well...

01:31:42.105 --> 01:31:44.150
You know why
they want you back?

01:31:44.194 --> 01:31:45.195
The liquor company

01:31:45.238 --> 01:31:48.546
can't find any
other firm with ideas

01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:50.330
as good as yours.

01:31:50.374 --> 01:31:51.897
That's a good thing.

01:31:51.941 --> 01:31:54.117
They said they're
willing to sign on

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.553
as clients, but only if

01:31:55.597 --> 01:31:57.816
you are in charge
of their account.

01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:01.559
So I say, congratulations
are in order.

01:32:02.734 --> 01:32:03.779
Oh. Rosa said
they need

01:32:03.822 --> 01:32:05.389
your answer as soon
as possible,

01:32:05.432 --> 01:32:07.391
so you better
call them now.

01:32:07.434 --> 01:32:09.872
I brought your phone.

01:32:10.612 --> 01:32:13.092
Is it true, son?

01:32:16.748 --> 01:32:19.490
Well, these things
she's saying,

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:21.361
I mean, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

01:32:21.405 --> 01:32:23.189
You're not leaving are you?

01:32:23.233 --> 01:32:24.277
Boy, don't you know

01:32:24.321 --> 01:32:27.280
once you go gospel,
you can't go back.

01:32:27.324 --> 01:32:29.195
God don't like ugly.

01:32:29.239 --> 01:32:30.370
Look at Sam Cooke.

01:32:30.414 --> 01:32:33.112
Left the church,
few years later...

01:32:33.156 --> 01:32:34.549
Shot dead in a motel.

01:32:34.592 --> 01:32:35.593
And Otis Redding

01:32:35.637 --> 01:32:37.116
left the church,

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.509
plane crash.

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:41.773
What about Whitney Houston,
and, uh, Arethra, Snoop?

01:32:41.817 --> 01:32:43.383
They started in the church.

01:32:43.427 --> 01:32:45.472
Boy, you just
killed three people.

01:32:45.516 --> 01:32:47.083
What about the Explosion?

01:32:47.126 --> 01:32:49.607
What about that money exploding
in my pocket, that prize money

01:32:49.651 --> 01:32:51.174
you said you were going

01:32:51.217 --> 01:32:53.350
to split with me 50/50?

01:32:53.393 --> 01:32:54.917
You promised him my half?

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:55.918
Your half?

01:32:55.961 --> 01:32:57.267
I have a half
in there somewhere.

01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:58.660
You're talking
about my half.

01:32:58.703 --> 01:33:00.575
And I'm in the
same church

01:33:00.618 --> 01:33:01.880
with these people?

01:33:01.924 --> 01:33:06.581
And I thought they was
holy and sanctified.

01:33:06.624 --> 01:33:08.844
They're waiting
for your answer.

01:33:17.809 --> 01:33:19.158
I don't care what you do.

01:33:19.202 --> 01:33:22.553
I was just using you
to get a record deal,

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:25.077
just like you were using me.

01:33:25.121 --> 01:33:26.731
Is that true?

01:33:36.959 --> 01:33:37.742
Rosa?

01:33:37.786 --> 01:33:39.962
Yeah, I got your message.

01:33:41.485 --> 01:33:44.401
Tell them I accept.

01:33:44.444 --> 01:33:47.622
Tomorrow?
I'll be there.

01:33:52.844 --> 01:33:55.107
So it's all about the money?

01:33:55.151 --> 01:33:56.456
Hell, yes.

01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:00.373
That's the reason why half
of you joined the choir.

01:34:00.417 --> 01:34:02.288
And why shouldn't I go back?

01:34:02.332 --> 01:34:04.639
What loyalty should
I have to this place?

01:34:04.682 --> 01:34:06.162
Sure, I've been lying,

01:34:06.205 --> 01:34:08.773
but that's nothing compared
to what this church

01:34:08.817 --> 01:34:10.470
did to me and my mom.

01:34:10.514 --> 01:34:11.689
If you leave,

01:34:11.733 --> 01:34:14.257
you'll be forfeiting
your inheritance money.

01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:16.955
I don't need it now.

01:34:16.999 --> 01:34:18.261
Look, just because
he's quitting,

01:34:18.304 --> 01:34:20.785
you don't have to give up
on all your hard work.

01:34:20.829 --> 01:34:23.614
We're still going
to the Explosion.

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:25.311
Shut up, Grandma.

01:34:25.355 --> 01:34:26.399
Don't you dare

01:34:26.443 --> 01:34:27.226
talk to me like that!

01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:28.358
Are you out
of your mind?

01:34:28.401 --> 01:34:29.446
Control yourself, Grandma.

01:34:29.489 --> 01:34:30.839
Come back here.
Don't you run from me!

01:34:30.882 --> 01:34:35.147
I cannot believe that I
was going to sleep with you.

01:34:52.904 --> 01:34:54.819
There you go.

01:34:56.342 --> 01:34:59.389
Home, sweet home.

01:35:03.785 --> 01:35:06.875
How about a cigar?

01:35:07.571 --> 01:35:08.833
How about a corner office?

01:35:08.877 --> 01:35:10.835
[ chuckling]
I'm serious.

01:35:10.879 --> 01:35:14.230
Of course, of course.

01:35:17.886 --> 01:35:21.324
♪ Uh-huh

01:35:21.367 --> 01:35:23.369
♪ Uh-huh...

01:35:23.413 --> 01:35:26.590
W-Why can't they do it deep
fried like they do in the South?

01:35:26.633 --> 01:35:29.027
Okay, okay, fine, fine,
I'll take

01:35:29.071 --> 01:35:32.857
the boneless,
skinless baked chicken.

01:35:32.901 --> 01:35:35.077
Yes, that's fine.

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.557
Oh, oh,
can I get the collard greens

01:35:37.601 --> 01:35:39.472
without the goat cheese?

01:35:51.049 --> 01:35:53.878
MAN:
Darrin? Darrin?

01:35:53.922 --> 01:35:56.663
Darrin,
we can't wait

01:35:56.707 --> 01:35:58.187
to hear your ideas.

01:35:59.623 --> 01:36:03.235
I'm the one
who got him back.

01:36:03.279 --> 01:36:06.848
Ladies and gentlemen,
since we last spoke,

01:36:06.891 --> 01:36:08.806
I've developed
a mega-campaign

01:36:08.850 --> 01:36:10.808
that will triple our revenue
within one year.

01:36:10.852 --> 01:36:13.593
This represents
the current markets

01:36:13.637 --> 01:36:14.769
targeted by
your competitors.

01:36:14.812 --> 01:36:16.466
From it, you see

01:36:16.509 --> 01:36:18.947
that the metropolitan areas
are saturated.

01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:20.687
We're selling
an urban product.

01:36:20.731 --> 01:36:23.125
Wrong-- you're selling
an urban image.

01:36:23.168 --> 01:36:25.736
Thus the primary focus
of my plan

01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:27.825
is to change brand identity.

01:36:27.869 --> 01:36:30.828
No more thugs and bums
drinking 40s.

01:36:30.872 --> 01:36:32.090
Instead,

01:36:32.134 --> 01:36:35.006
only young,
successful urbanites.

01:36:35.050 --> 01:36:37.835
That means appealing
to the little man

01:36:37.879 --> 01:36:39.706
who dreams of making it
in the fast lane.

01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:42.100
We capitalize on
people who dream

01:36:42.144 --> 01:36:43.188
of a more glamorous life

01:36:43.232 --> 01:36:44.842
than the one
that they currently have.

01:36:44.886 --> 01:36:46.801
People
who are easily influenced.

01:36:46.844 --> 01:36:49.455
People here,

01:36:49.499 --> 01:36:52.894
and here, and he...

01:36:52.937 --> 01:36:54.721
And here.

01:36:54.765 --> 01:36:58.073
The small-town barber.

01:37:00.162 --> 01:37:02.381
The clerk
at the local dry cleaners.

01:37:04.383 --> 01:37:06.472
The people that think
that urban life

01:37:06.516 --> 01:37:09.301
is where their dreams are.

01:37:09.345 --> 01:37:12.174
Those are the people
that need your product.

01:37:17.048 --> 01:37:18.180
They need your lies,

01:37:18.223 --> 01:37:20.138
your false images
of success and glamour.

01:37:20.182 --> 01:37:22.010
The poison that
causes them to look

01:37:22.053 --> 01:37:23.141
for fulfillment

01:37:23.185 --> 01:37:25.665
in material things
rather than in people.

01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:27.102
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

01:37:27.145 --> 01:37:28.494
if making money
is our number-one goal,

01:37:28.538 --> 01:37:31.976
then it's the little people
in the little towns

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:33.195
that we should exploit.

01:37:33.238 --> 01:37:35.588
After all, what do they know?

01:37:35.632 --> 01:37:40.550
They're just a bunch of country
bumpkins anyway, right?

01:37:50.734 --> 01:37:53.476
Way to go, Darrin.

01:37:55.608 --> 01:37:57.697

01:37:57.741 --> 01:37:59.874
Yes!

01:37:59.917 --> 01:38:03.529
That's the way
we're all going to make money.

01:38:06.184 --> 01:38:09.579
Well done, Darrin.

01:38:22.374 --> 01:38:27.423

you'd be here.

01:38:39.957 --> 01:38:43.700
It was on the radio
in the back.

01:38:43.743 --> 01:38:45.180
Where is everybody?

01:38:45.223 --> 01:38:49.227
They're on the way to Columbus
for the Gospel Explosion.

01:38:49.271 --> 01:38:51.838
I didn't think
they'd have left yet.

01:38:51.882 --> 01:38:53.666
Why aren't you with them?

01:38:53.710 --> 01:38:56.278
Paulina found out I gave you
the names of them singers.

01:38:56.321 --> 01:38:59.020
We had a fight,
and I asserted myself.

01:38:59.063 --> 01:39:00.064
What happened?

01:39:00.108 --> 01:39:01.979
They went without me.

01:39:02.023 --> 01:39:03.111
Oh.

01:39:03.154 --> 01:39:05.940
I'm afraid Lilly's
not with them, either.

01:39:05.983 --> 01:39:07.811
Nobody has seen her
since you left.

01:39:07.854 --> 01:39:10.988
Uh, but I've been fine
since you left.

01:39:11.032 --> 01:39:13.730
Thanks for asking.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.610
What are you doing here?

01:39:24.654 --> 01:39:26.047
I came back.

01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:27.962
I should have never left
in the first place.

01:39:28.005 --> 01:39:29.224
Go away.

01:39:29.267 --> 01:39:32.575
I don't want to see you.

01:39:32.618 --> 01:39:36.057
Is it because I lied
about being a music producer?

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:38.450
I'm sorry
about that, too.

01:39:38.494 --> 01:39:39.364
I'm not a fool.

01:39:39.408 --> 01:39:40.539
I knew you weren't
a producer.

01:39:40.583 --> 01:39:43.673
You didn't even know
what a downbeat was.

01:39:43.716 --> 01:39:44.979
You didn't know the difference

01:39:45.022 --> 01:39:46.154
in keys and notes.

01:39:46.197 --> 01:39:48.678
You didn't know...
Right, I get your point.

01:39:48.721 --> 01:39:51.115
If you knew all that,
why'd you get so mad?

01:39:51.159 --> 01:39:54.031
I was angry with myself.

01:39:54.075 --> 01:39:57.078
It's my own fault.

01:39:57.121 --> 01:39:58.340
I don't know
why I expected

01:39:58.383 --> 01:40:00.472
anything different
from someone like you.

01:40:00.516 --> 01:40:03.214
Yeah. I blamed you, too,
at first.

01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:08.350
Well, I had to blame someone.

01:40:08.393 --> 01:40:11.048
But when I got back to New York,
something was different.

01:40:11.092 --> 01:40:12.919
For some reason,
I felt like

01:40:12.963 --> 01:40:14.312
I didn't have to lie anymore.

01:40:14.356 --> 01:40:16.271
The truth felt better.

01:40:16.314 --> 01:40:19.752
Why should I believe you now?

01:40:19.796 --> 01:40:20.927
Because I came back

01:40:20.971 --> 01:40:23.104
so that the commitment
I made to the choir

01:40:23.147 --> 01:40:25.193
wouldn't be a lie.

01:40:27.978 --> 01:40:29.066

I deserve it.

01:40:32.765 --> 01:40:36.204
But don't let the choir down.

01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:37.727
Please.

01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:40.077
Come with me to the Explosion.

I can't.

as soon as you left.

01:40:45.126 --> 01:40:46.388
You got to come with me.

Without you, that choir

01:40:47.824 --> 01:40:50.218

and Miss Round-the-Way here

01:45:04.036 --> 01:45:05.299
can just leave.

01:45:05.342 --> 01:45:06.430
Tell 'em, Paul.

01:45:06.474 --> 01:45:07.736
Let's not go...

01:45:07.779 --> 01:45:08.998
Let's not forget
that when you went to New York,

01:45:09.041 --> 01:45:11.653
you forfeited your rights
to the inheritance.

01:45:11.696 --> 01:45:13.611
Isn't that
what the will says,

01:45:13.655 --> 01:45:16.005
Paul?

01:45:16.658 --> 01:45:18.355
Paul!

01:45:18.399 --> 01:45:20.009
Oh, now, don't worry,
he agrees with me.

01:45:20.052 --> 01:45:21.053
The will doesn't
say anything

01:45:21.097 --> 01:45:23.534
about a cackling,
overbearing,

01:45:23.578 --> 01:45:26.798
hypocritical, old
bitty who's about
to drive me crazy

01:45:26.842 --> 01:45:28.452
just like she
did her husband!

01:45:28.496 --> 01:45:32.021
I didn't drive James crazy,
Paul-- God rest his soul.

01:45:32.064 --> 01:45:33.109
And that's
another thing.

01:45:33.152 --> 01:45:34.328
I'm tired of
telling this lie

01:45:34.371 --> 01:45:37.331
to everybody about
you being a widow.
What?

01:45:37.374 --> 01:45:39.637
James lives in Patterson County,
y'all.

01:45:39.681 --> 01:45:40.986
[ gasping]
Yeah, with a big,

01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:44.425
fine, new young wife--
know how to make a man say,

01:45:44.468 --> 01:45:45.513
"Amen" when he at home,

01:45:45.556 --> 01:45:47.819
as well as
in the church.

01:45:47.863 --> 01:45:49.125
[ laughter]

01:45:49.168 --> 01:45:50.605
LILLY:
You can nitpick about
the church bylaws

01:45:50.648 --> 01:45:53.172
and the technicalities of Aunt
Sally's will all you want,

01:45:53.216 --> 01:45:55.827
but what really matters
is the spirit of her wishes,

01:45:55.871 --> 01:46:00.179
and Aunt Sally's dying wish was
for Darrin to lead this choir.

01:46:00.223 --> 01:46:01.920
End of story.

01:46:03.574 --> 01:46:08.144
You think you can
challenge me, boy?

01:46:11.408 --> 01:46:13.410
Reverend Lewis...
Hmm?

01:46:13.454 --> 01:46:14.542
do the bylaws say anything

01:46:14.585 --> 01:46:18.720
about voting someone out
of the choir?

01:46:20.069 --> 01:46:21.331
Yes, they do...

01:46:21.375 --> 01:46:23.377
as long as it's
by a majority

01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:25.422
of baptized
choir members.

01:46:25.466 --> 01:46:27.424
Paulina, thank you
for making sure

01:46:27.468 --> 01:46:30.166
all of us are baptized.

01:46:30.209 --> 01:46:35.040

out of the choir...

mail your
inheritance check?
Keep it.

01:47:24.438 --> 01:47:26.744
Make it out
to the Beulah Baptist Church.

01:47:26.788 --> 01:47:29.268
Don't you want to
know how much it is?

01:47:29.312 --> 01:47:33.447
I want to give the church
a Sally Walker Day Care Center

01:47:33.490 --> 01:47:34.273
and a new roof.

01:47:34.317 --> 01:47:37.929
It was only worth $357.

01:47:37.973 --> 01:47:40.497
I-I thought you said
the portfolio

01:47:40.541 --> 01:47:41.585
was worth $150,000.

01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:42.717
Didn't you
read about it?

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:45.328
Georgia Telecom
went belly-up

01:47:45.371 --> 01:47:47.635
when you were
up in New York.

01:47:47.678 --> 01:47:49.593
I guess we better
go win this church some money.

01:47:59.908 --> 01:48:02.301
I want you to hear
how they announce us.

01:48:02.345 --> 01:48:04.129
Why?

01:48:04.173 --> 01:48:05.130
You inspired it.

01:48:05.174 --> 01:48:07.132
I did?
Yes.

01:48:07.176 --> 01:48:09.178
Right now, from
the Beulah Baptist Church

01:48:09.221 --> 01:48:10.788
in Monte Carlo, Georgia...

01:48:10.832 --> 01:48:14.836
Here are the
Fighting Temptations!

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.623
Okay. Is everyone ready?

01:48:19.667 --> 01:48:21.625
Yo, why do we have
to wear these robes?

01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:22.887
I don't wear this stuff.

01:48:22.931 --> 01:48:24.802
Yes, everyone has to
wear the same thing.
Why?

01:48:24.846 --> 01:48:26.630
My suit is tight,
and ladies don't like

01:48:26.674 --> 01:48:27.675
to see Lucius in no robe.

01:48:27.718 --> 01:48:30.765
Okay, everyone
takes their robe off.

01:48:30.808 --> 01:48:32.375
No.

01:48:32.418 --> 01:48:37.772
Well, apparently the
Fighting Temptations
aren't quite ready.

01:48:38.599 --> 01:48:40.165

from the Fighting Temptations
Yes.
