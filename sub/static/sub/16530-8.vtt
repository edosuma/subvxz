00:06.040 --> 00:06.174
.

00:07.208 --> 00:07.841
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:07.875 --> 00:08.876
sexually based offenses

00:08.909 --> 00:11.512
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.148
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.182 --> 00:16.084
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.117 --> 00:17.351
are members of an elite squad

00:17.385 --> 00:19.420
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.156
These are their stories.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.227
- Hey, uh, I was just about
to put Noah to bed,

00:26.260 --> 00:28.162
but I have a sec.

00:28.196 --> 00:31.265
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:31.299 --> 00:34.135
I know.
Never enough time, right?

00:35.303 --> 00:38.239
Okay, um, well,
I could do lunch.

00:38.272 --> 00:41.275
- Mommy, Mommy, look!

00:41.309 --> 00:42.576
- Noah, don't move.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.445
Ed, I gotta call you back.

00:44.478 --> 00:48.048
Noah, honey,
what're you doing up there?

00:48.682 --> 00:51.285
What are you doing, my love?

00:51.319 --> 00:53.287
- Please I can have a cookie.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.556
- Oh, honey,
that's so dangerous.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.425
You gotta ask Mommy first.
Right?

00:57.458 --> 01:00.394
You could have fallen down
and hurt yourself.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.529
Right?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.531
Oh, Noah.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.200
All right, it's time for bed,
sweet boy.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.569
- [gasps]

01:08.602 --> 01:10.871
Wow, wow.
- [giggles softly]

01:10.904 --> 01:12.506
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.308
- Okay.
Good night,

01:14.342 --> 01:17.111
sleep tight,
don't let the bed bugs bite.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.279
- [chuckles]
Tighter.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.348
- Tighter, like a mummy?
Okay.

01:20.381 --> 01:23.417
- [growls playfully]
- [giggles]

01:23.451 --> 01:25.319
- I'll see you in the morning,
Theo, okay?

01:25.353 --> 01:26.587
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.589
Good night.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.560
Nadine, I'm leaving now.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.563
- Oh, Gloria,
I forgot to get cash.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.431
- Oh, it's no problem.
- Theo's in bed?

01:37.465 --> 01:40.201
- Yes, he's tired.
It's late.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.435
- Well, he doesn't
have school tomorrow,

01:41.469 --> 01:44.605
so he'll be fine.
- Okay.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.507
- Hey, you ready for lights out?

01:46.540 --> 01:50.344
- Not all the way.
- I know, I know.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.913
There we go.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.683
Do you wanna wear
your quiet headphones tonight?

01:55.716 --> 01:57.451
Mommy's having company.

01:57.485 --> 02:00.921
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.224
There you go.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.531
Love you.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.538
- There she is.
- Entrez, entrez.

02:17.571 --> 02:18.639
both: Mwah!

02:18.672 --> 02:20.541
- Looking fabulous.
- Oh.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.443
Mm, peonies.
My favorite.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.645
- Theo asleep?
- He is out like a light.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.281
He was exhausted.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.476
- Theo?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.712
Theo, where are you?

02:58.746 --> 03:01.249
Theo?

03:01.282 --> 03:02.950
Theo.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.686
[breathing shakily]
Theo!

03:05.719 --> 03:08.689
Theo!
- Gloria, what is it?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.424
- Theo's missing.
Is he with you?

03:10.458 --> 03:12.326
- No.
What are you talking about?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.495
- He's gone.
- He's not gone, okay.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.597
He's in the house somewhere.
- No, no, I looked everywhere.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.367
He's not here,
and the front door was open.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.337
His room is a mess.
Please, maybe--I--

03:23.371 --> 03:24.772
- Oh, my God.
Theo?

03:24.805 --> 03:27.275
- What is it?
- I have to call 911.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.976
Where the hell is my cell phone?

03:29.009 --> 03:31.479
Theo!

03:31.512 --> 03:32.813
- We have a missing
six-year-old boy?

03:32.846 --> 03:35.716
- Theo Lachere.
Nanny came to wake him at 7:30,

03:35.749 --> 03:37.551
front door was open,
he was gone.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.752
- Nanny?
What about the parents?

03:38.786 --> 03:40.488
- No father in the picture.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.723
The mother, Nadine Lachere,

03:42.756 --> 03:45.493
had some friends over
last night.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.994
- Friends over?

03:47.027 --> 03:48.829
Okay.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.302
- This is more
than friends over.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.271
With a six-year old
in the house?

04:01.309 --> 04:04.278
[dramatic music]

04:04.312 --> 04:11.385
*

04:47.355 --> 04:49.623
- He was right there sleeping.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.059
I came to check on him.
- What time was this?

04:52.092 --> 04:56.063
- About every--every hour or so.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.967
His floor rug is missing.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.403
It was here last night.
- Okay, that's helpful.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.505
Now when was the last time
that you saw Theo?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.407
- About 2:00 or 2:30.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.975
- Were any of the guests
still here at that time?

05:08.008 --> 05:10.411
- Kat, but she didn't do this.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.480
She was in bed with me.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.448
- I was with Nadine all night.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.617
Th--we looked in
on Theo together.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.352
- Okay, what time was this?

05:18.386 --> 05:20.120
- Around 2:00.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.955
He was sound asleep.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.624
- Okay, what's your relationship
with her?

05:23.657 --> 05:26.627
- We're friends.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.128
I know all this looks bad,

05:28.161 --> 05:31.031
but, Nadine,
she's a good mother.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.533
- Theo always sleeps
through the night

05:32.566 --> 05:34.402
when I have people over.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.370
- Okay, and how many people
did you have over?

05:36.404 --> 05:40.007
- Uh, I don't know,
maybe at some point 15, 16.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.742
- And you're sure none of them
were here in the loft

05:41.775 --> 05:43.076
when you went to sleep?
- I don't know.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.645
I'm not sure.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.480
They were friends
bringing friends.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.049
- Okay, we're gonna make a list
of everyone that you did know.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.117
All right?
Now, listen.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.620
Can you think of anyone that
would want to take Theo?

05:52.653 --> 05:54.388
- No, no one.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.623
- Detective.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.491
- What is it?

05:59.660 --> 06:01.094
What is that?

06:01.128 --> 06:03.130
- Ms. Lachere, come on.
Let's--let's step out.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.933
Let's let the tech do his work.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.068
- I offered
to stay over last night,

06:08.101 --> 06:09.770
but Nadine said
that I should go home.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.039
- And what time was this?

06:12.072 --> 06:14.107
- Uh, 9:00.

06:14.141 --> 06:17.044
I tucked Theo in bed,
and then I went home,

06:17.077 --> 06:18.546
and when I came back
this morning,

06:18.579 --> 06:20.080
the front door was open.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.115
- What time was that?
- 7:30.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.752
I made sure I was on time.
I knew that Theo would need me.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.186
- Any of these people

06:26.219 --> 06:29.723
maybe you worry
about being around Theo?

06:29.757 --> 06:32.993
Look, I can tell
that you care about him.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.662
You been his nanny a long time?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.764
- Since he was born.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.633
He's such a shy boy.
He must be so scared.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.038
- So what do we got?
- The mother has a wild party

06:45.072 --> 06:48.542
and her son disappears sometime
between 2:00 and 7:30 a.m.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.677
- Is there a ransom note
or a call?

06:49.710 --> 06:50.878
- Nothing yet.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.447
We're monitoring Nadine's
house phone and her cell though.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.615
- Could he have wandered off?

06:54.648 --> 06:56.450
- There's signs of a struggle.
See?

06:56.484 --> 06:58.051
They found blood
there on the table.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.653
- Excuse me.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.522
[exhales]

07:01.555 --> 07:03.023
It's not enough
for an Amber Alert

07:03.056 --> 07:04.224
unless we have a suspect
or a vehicle.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.694
- I'll check the security cams
and canvas the neighborhood.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.828
- Yeah.

07:07.861 --> 07:11.064
- So, uh, the mom is a mess

07:11.098 --> 07:12.666
and hungover's
just the half of it.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.767
- Is there any way
she's involved?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.803
- Well, she's not
Mother of the Year.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.771
Anything's possible.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.511
- Ms. Lachere,
I'm Lieutenant Benson.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.646
- You have to find my son.
You have to find Theo.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.648
- We're doing
everything that we can,

07:27.681 --> 07:29.483
but right now
I need you to provide us

07:29.517 --> 07:31.151
with the most recent photo
of Theo

07:31.184 --> 07:33.654
and something that
has his DNA on it.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.755
- I don't understand.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.156
- Well, we found blood
in his room.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.625
We need to see if it's Theo's.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.559
- Blood.
Oh, my God.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.160
- No, no, we--
it's just a small amount.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.762
It could be nothing.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.765
- [crying]
I know what this must look like,

07:44.798 --> 07:47.668
but I would never
put my little boy in danger.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.538
- Okay, but we're, uh--
we're gonna need you

07:50.571 --> 07:54.141
to come down to the station
and give us a full statement.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.843
- [quietly]
What--uh, am I in trouble?

07:55.876 --> 07:57.778
Because those aren't mine.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.114
- Right now our only concern is
to find your son,

08:01.148 --> 08:04.718
so how about you get dressed
and then you come with us, okay?

08:09.256 --> 08:11.191
Any names you can
provide us with is a start.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.226
- And anyone else
with a role in Theo's life?

08:13.260 --> 08:15.596
His father, maybe?
- Just my ex-wife.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.197
Fran Conway.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.066
Theo's a sperm donor baby.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.300
Fran and I raised him together

08:20.333 --> 08:21.802
until we got divorced
two years ago.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.605
- Okay, does she have custody?
Visitation rights?

08:24.638 --> 08:25.606
- Not officially.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.108
Fran's an orthopedic surgeon,
top of her field.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.543
She's at the hospital
all the time.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.812
- Okay, does she have
a relationship with Theo?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.814
- I let her see him
a few times a month.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.616
It's hard to work
around her schedule.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.685
- Okay, we're gonna need
her contact information.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.286
- I've been calling.
She's not answering.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.821
- She wasn't at the party?
- No.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.824
Fran's not like that.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.827
Oh, she's gonna be so angry.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.828
She's gonna blame me.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.731
- Nadine, was there anybody
that you didn't know

08:50.764 --> 08:52.833
who may have given you
a bad feeling?

08:52.866 --> 08:55.235
- There was some young guy.
You know, super drunk.

08:55.268 --> 08:58.205
He spilled red wine.
He left early.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.773
[exhales sharply]

08:59.807 --> 09:02.676
I don't know,
the night's a blur, okay?

09:02.710 --> 09:04.544
[sighs, sniffles]

09:05.979 --> 09:08.716
There was...

09:08.749 --> 09:10.918
there was another man
that I didn't know.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.285
- Okay.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.689
- He was taking
lots of pictures on his phone.

09:15.723 --> 09:16.824
He asked if my son was home.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.592
- Did he come
with someone you know?

09:18.626 --> 09:19.827
- I'm not sure.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.762
Uh, Kat saw
how freaked out I was.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.263
She made sure that he was gone.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.165
She said he took a QuikRide.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.768
Why was he asking about Theo?
Was it him?

09:29.970 --> 09:32.873
- Nadine's friend Kat confirms
that a white male in his 30s

09:32.906 --> 09:34.207
was taking pictures
on his phone.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.743
He left in a QuikRide
around 11:00.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.845
- QuikRide reports a pickup
on that block

09:37.878 --> 09:39.947
around 11:15.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.949
Passenger's name
was Kevin Dorsey.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.851
Driver confirms
that he was alone,

09:43.884 --> 09:45.318
on his phone,
and agitated.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.754
- Okay, you get
a drop off address?

09:46.787 --> 09:48.622
- Yeah, on our way, Lieutenant.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.824
- Okay, did CSU get anything
from the boy's room?

09:50.858 --> 09:52.826
Prints, DNA?
- They're still processing.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.194
There's a lot of prints,
hair fibers,

09:54.227 --> 09:55.863
but, um, they did confirm that

09:55.896 --> 09:58.331
the blood on the table
is a match to Theo.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.835
- What about the nanny?

10:01.869 --> 10:02.936
- Gloria Ramirez.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.272
Mexican national,
green card, no record.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.641
She's worked for the family
for the last six years,

10:07.675 --> 10:09.743
and she used her Metrocard
last night

10:09.777 --> 10:11.845
at the E Train at Canal at 9:45,

10:11.879 --> 10:13.213
and then swiped again
at Jamaica Station

10:13.246 --> 10:14.147
at 6:30 this morning.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.216
- What about street cams,
surveillance?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.651
- Well, it's just
a lot of people

10:17.685 --> 10:19.019
going in and out
of Nadine's loft.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.321
Uh, there's no sign of Theo,

10:21.354 --> 10:22.823
but there are
a couple of blind spots,

10:22.856 --> 10:24.825
including the service entrance
to her building

10:24.858 --> 10:26.026
and two side streets,

10:26.059 --> 10:27.861
so TARU's going through
the footage.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.663
- And the neighbors
didn't hear anything?

10:29.697 --> 10:30.831
Didn't see anything?
[cell phone buzzes]

10:30.864 --> 10:34.367
- No, it's a lot of complaints
about noise from the party.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.806
- Okay.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.941
Just keep the pressure on TARU

10:40.974 --> 10:43.443
and did you get anything
from the tip line?

10:43.476 --> 10:46.213
- Nothing solid.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.215
I mean, I just...

10:48.248 --> 10:49.783
I can't imagine
what she's going through.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.352
Having your kid
out there somewhere.

10:52.385 --> 10:55.055
You don't know anything.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.857
- [quietly]
Yeah.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.764
- I didn't do anything illegal.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.233
It's not a crime
to take pictures at a party.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.035
- Might be.
- What are you talking about?

11:08.068 --> 11:09.737
- You were
at Nadine Lachere's apartment,

11:09.770 --> 11:11.371
you were taking photos,
you were asking questions

11:11.404 --> 11:14.074
about her son.
Well, now he's missing.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.876
- I-I didn't know.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.010
You think I had
something to do with it?

11:17.044 --> 11:18.445
- Did you?
- No, that's crazy.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.080
- Not to us.
Why were you taking photos?

11:20.113 --> 11:21.849
- Okay.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.383
I'm a licensed
private detective.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.353
I was hired to follow
Nadine Lachere and her son.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.321
- Hired by who?

11:31.291 --> 11:32.760
Fran Conway?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.762
- Yes, can I help you?
- NYPD.

11:34.795 --> 11:35.863
We'd like to ask you
some questions

11:35.896 --> 11:37.097
about Nadine Lachere
and her son.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.399
- Theo?

11:39.432 --> 11:40.768
What happened?
Is he okay?

11:40.801 --> 11:41.902
- No, he's not.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.370
He went missing
earlier this morning.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.038
- What?
Missing?

11:45.072 --> 11:47.274
- Your ex-wife's been calling.
You didn't pick up.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.109
- I've been in surgery
since 6:00 a.m.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.044
So what are you saying?
He's--he's been kidnapped?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.846
- He disappeared
from Nadine's loft.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.014
She had a party last night,

11:54.047 --> 11:55.983
but you already knew that,
didn't you?

11:56.016 --> 11:57.350
- Excuse me?

11:57.384 --> 11:58.886
- You hired a PI
to take pictures.

11:58.919 --> 11:59.853
- Hang on.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.055
You think I'm involved
in kidnapping Theo?

12:02.089 --> 12:04.724
- We're just asking questions.
Why was he taking pictures?

12:06.326 --> 12:08.829
- Because I needed evidence.

12:08.862 --> 12:12.032
I'm suing Nadine for custody.

12:22.542 --> 12:22.675
.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.477
- Dr. Conway,
I'm Lieutenant Benson.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.412
- Have you found anything yet?
- Not yet.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.481
- Fran, where's Theo?
Did you take him?

12:28.515 --> 12:30.017
- No, of course not.
- Where is he?

12:30.050 --> 12:32.485
- Nadine, let's go.
- What were you thinking

12:32.519 --> 12:34.487
having a party like that?
Was Theo there?

12:34.521 --> 12:35.755
- No, he was fine.
He was fine.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.025
He was wearing his headphones.
- What are you talking about?

12:38.058 --> 12:40.227
He is missing!
- Okay, calm down, Dr. Conway.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.561
- My office.
- All right, this way.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.930
Come on.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.098
- Did we send unis
to the doctor's house

12:45.132 --> 12:47.000
and search her house, her car?

12:47.034 --> 12:48.902
- So far, nothing.
- [sighs]

12:48.936 --> 12:51.905
- I hired a private detective
to protect Theo.

12:51.939 --> 12:52.806
You saw that party.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.908
- We don't know
that Theo's disappearance

12:54.942 --> 12:56.009
had anything to do
with that party.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.578
- Well, who else could it be?
- Well, you tell me.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.481
A lot of child abductions
turn out to be orchestrated

13:01.514 --> 13:02.916
by the non-custodial parent.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.485
- What are you saying?
That I'm a suspect?

13:05.518 --> 13:06.586
- I'm saying that
we're gonna be

13:06.619 --> 13:08.188
going through
your phone records,

13:08.221 --> 13:10.891
through your bank statements,
and talking to the PI,

13:10.924 --> 13:12.159
and getting a warrant

13:12.192 --> 13:14.027
for any of the photos
that he may have taken.

13:14.061 --> 13:16.296
So if there's anything
that you wanna tell me,

13:16.329 --> 13:18.899
now would be the time.
- Wow.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.201
Yeah, I-I didn't take Theo.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.469
I've just hired a lawyer.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.304
I am going to fight for him
in court.

13:24.337 --> 13:27.007
- And when is the last time
you did see Theo?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.208
- Two weeks ago,

13:28.241 --> 13:29.609
and before you judge me,

13:29.642 --> 13:31.211
that's all Nadine
would agree to.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.479
- Okay.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.147
- [exhales sharply]
- I understand.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.917
Look, why don't you have a seat.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.253
- Look, after Nadine
and I separated,

13:40.287 --> 13:41.989
I tried to get visitation.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.091
I was told that
under the New York law,

13:44.124 --> 13:47.094
a non-adoptive,
non-biological caretaker

13:47.127 --> 13:48.962
is not defined as a parent.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.064
Now, thank God,
the laws have changed.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.166
My lawyer thinks
I have a good shot.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.536
So why would I ruin that
by kidnapping Theo?

13:56.569 --> 13:58.305
- Well, when were you gonna
tell Nadine all of this?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.907
- Well, not until
I had enough evidence

13:59.940 --> 14:03.543
to convince a judge that
I should have joint custody.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.946
Theo told me
they're moving to Ibiza.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.647
- Okay, Nadine didn't
mention that.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.950
- Yeah, well, Nadine doesn't
mention a lot of things.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.119
She barely lets me
see Theo as it is.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.553
If she takes him
out of the country,

14:13.586 --> 14:15.622
I won't see him again.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.290
- She never even adopted Theo.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.626
She can't do that.
- Actually, now she can.

14:19.659 --> 14:20.928
- She doesn't have time
for a kid.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.062
She doesn't want a kid.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.264
- Nadine, you accused her
of kidnapping three times

14:24.297 --> 14:26.233
in the last hour.
- Ugh, I didn't mean that.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.301
Fran would never break the law.
- Okay, which brings us back.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.669
Is there anybody
in your circle who would?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.205
- No.
- Stranger abductions are rare.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.641
So is there anybody in your life
that could be angry with you?

14:34.674 --> 14:37.044
Maybe--maybe someone
you owed money?

14:37.077 --> 14:38.278
A drug dealer?

14:38.311 --> 14:40.113
- No.
All right?

14:40.147 --> 14:42.149
I don't know why the hell you're
asking me these questions.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.952
Just go find my son.
I can't take this anymore.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.154
- We're doing everything we can.

14:47.187 --> 14:50.357
- Okay, Dr. Conway,
is there anyone in Theo's life

14:50.390 --> 14:52.159
that you've had
suspicions about?

14:52.192 --> 14:55.128
Anybody from the neighborhood?
Anyone from his school?

14:55.162 --> 14:56.329
- I don't know anyone
at the school.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.031
I'm not even on the pickup list.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.933
I brought cupcakes
for his birthday,

14:59.967 --> 15:01.168
had to leave 'em
at the front desk.

15:01.201 --> 15:05.172
- Anybody else
that you can think of?

15:05.205 --> 15:07.240
- Yes, my--

15:07.274 --> 15:09.042
my private detective
was investigating

15:09.076 --> 15:12.179
Nadine's girlfriends
and boyfriends.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.214
After we separated,
she was searching for something.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.083
Love, I guess.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.650
- So she started dating men?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.352
- More like boys.
Bad boys.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.254
Musicians, actors, models

15:21.288 --> 15:23.223
turned drug dealers.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.326
- Okay, anyone in particular
that you're talking about?

15:27.294 --> 15:29.296
Who is this?
- That's Gabriel,

15:29.329 --> 15:31.298
but I haven't dated him
in two months.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.200
- So a man you recently went out
with has a criminal record

15:33.233 --> 15:34.334
and you didn't
tell us about that?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.303
- I'm sure he didn't take Theo.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.105
- Was he at the party
last night?

15:38.138 --> 15:41.174
- No, I broke up with him,
like I said, two months ago.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.210
- For what reason?
- He's an angry, British

15:43.243 --> 15:44.377
failed musician.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.080
He'd drink and do coke all day.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.149
He gave me a black eye, okay?
I'd had enough.

15:49.182 --> 15:52.119
- Did he ever threaten
to hurt Theo?

15:52.152 --> 15:55.255
- I broke up with him
to keep him away from Theo.

15:57.057 --> 16:00.093
- Why didn't you
tell us about this?

16:00.127 --> 16:02.695
- Because I thought you'd think
that I was a bad mother,

16:02.729 --> 16:04.264
and then when you did find Theo,

16:04.297 --> 16:06.099
you would take him away from me.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.667
[knocking on door]

16:09.102 --> 16:11.738
- Okay, Nadine,
give us a second.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.708
[door closes]

16:15.742 --> 16:17.144
- We ran Gabriel Norton.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.112
Drug charges,
disorderly conduct.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.081
- Nadine said he wasn't
at the loft last night.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.649
- Yeah, well,
the lab says differently.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.185
Hairs found in Theo's bedroom
are a DNA match for Gabriel.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.020
- Do you have a last known?
- Lower East Side.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.289
We're headed there now.
- Great.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.490
- Hey.
- Ed.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.392
- Sorry to just drop by.
I was worried.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.061
I didn't hear back from you.
- Oh.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.196
- Noah okay?
- Yeah, he ju--he's fine.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.299
He just climbed up
on the kitchen counter.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.267
- Ah.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.136
- I'm so sorry I didn't
get back to you today.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.504
We have a missing six-year-old.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.806
- Yeah, I know.
I saw the news.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.241
You all right?

16:48.275 --> 16:51.078
- Yeah, just a lot to deal with.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.713
- Yeah, I can imagine.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.282
You know, it's only
been a week

16:55.315 --> 16:58.485
since you shot
and killed a man, Liv.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.287
I mean, I know it was
a clean shoot and everything,

17:00.320 --> 17:02.455
but it can still take a toll.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.325
- Yeah, I'm fine.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.763
- I don't figure I could
persuade you to get out of here?

17:10.797 --> 17:12.165
Maybe take a walk,
get a cup of coffee

17:12.199 --> 17:14.234
or something?

17:14.267 --> 17:16.236
- I can't leave now.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.306
I'm--I'm just right
in the middle of everything.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.440
I'm sorry.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.209
- I know.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.347
All right.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.452
[door closes]

17:35.888 --> 17:39.792
[knocks on door]
- Gabriel Norton, NYPD, open up!

17:39.826 --> 17:43.730
- Gabriel's not here.
- Yeah, we've got a warrant.

17:43.763 --> 17:44.831
- Sit back down.

17:44.864 --> 17:45.765
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.534
You sit down too.
- Where's Gabriel now?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.102
- I don't know.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.281
- We got kids' toys and clothes.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.482
- He's out the window!

18:02.515 --> 18:04.217
- Here.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.460
- NYPD, stop!

18:19.532 --> 18:23.170
- Nowhere to run, Gabriel.
Put your hands up.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.472
- Where's Theo?

18:25.505 --> 18:26.573
- Theo?
I've no idea.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.309
- Yeah, then why do you have
kids' clothes, toys, huh?

18:29.342 --> 18:31.311
- I bought those for Theo
for Christmas.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.913
Nadine threw them in my face.
I don't know where he is.

18:33.946 --> 18:37.150
- Why'd you run?
- Huh, maybe because of this?

18:37.184 --> 18:38.585
- That registered?

18:38.618 --> 18:39.919
- I think I should
call my lawyer.

18:46.626 --> 18:46.759
.

18:47.894 --> 18:48.861
- My client is here
because he wants to cooperate.

18:48.895 --> 18:49.996
- Your client is here
because we busted him

18:50.029 --> 18:53.466
with an unregistered gun
and cocaine in his apartment.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.534
- And as a lawyer,
you should know that

18:54.567 --> 18:56.436
with those additional charges
and his rap sheet,

18:56.469 --> 18:58.171
he's looking at 7 to 15.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.639
- Let's not get contentious.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.441
- We just wanna know
what happened to Theo.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.243
- I don't know anything
about the kid.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.577
- Then how come we found hair
matching your DNA

19:04.611 --> 19:05.645
in Theo's room.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.380
- My client dated
the boy's mother.

19:07.414 --> 19:08.448
Those hairs could have
been there for months.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.417
- When was the last time you
were at Nadine's loft?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.285
- Two months ago.
She broke it off with me.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.653
I never went back.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.223
- And why would anyone
ever break up with you, Gabriel?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.591
- She said she was happier
being a lesbian.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.593
Crazy bitch.
- Right.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.462
Dumping a wonderful guy
like you.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.231
I could see why
that would piss you off.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.832
- She was lucky to be with me.
- All right, Gabriel,

19:25.865 --> 19:28.268
take it down a notch.
- You seem angry, Gabriel.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.569
Maybe angry enough
to take it out on Theo?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.771
- My client held nothing
against the boy or her.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.240
- Oh, really?

19:33.273 --> 19:35.575
His, uh, text messages
say differently.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.345
"Go to hell, Nadine.
You and your snot-nosed kid."

19:38.378 --> 19:39.379
That's not looking good,
Gabriel.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.447
- All right, all right.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.581
So he was upset
about a bad breakup.

19:41.614 --> 19:45.285
- She had the nerve to tell me
her son was afraid of me.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.653
I bought him presents.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.555
I was trying.
- Mm.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.557
- Okay, where were you
last night?

19:50.590 --> 19:52.792
- At home watching football.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.394
Real football.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.396
- You think this is funny?

19:56.429 --> 19:57.864
There's a six-year-old boy
missing.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.666
- I've told you
everything I know!

19:59.699 --> 20:02.402
- Okay, fellas,
I think we're done here.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.239
[door opens]
- Not much of an alibi.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.274
- Yeah, this guy
seems like more like

20:07.307 --> 20:08.875
an angry, British douchebag
than a child abductor.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.378
- I still want a search warrant
for his car and computer.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.480
- Oh, absolutely, and he's not
walking out of here.

20:13.513 --> 20:14.781
Hold him on that gun charge.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.883
- Tell him myself.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.553
- It's been 12 hours.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.889
- Lieutenant, I hear you.
- Do we have anything?

20:22.922 --> 20:25.858
What about those photos that
the PI took at the party?

20:25.892 --> 20:27.527
- Facial recognition
didn't get anything.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.462
All of Nadine's friends are
amazing New Yorkers,

20:29.496 --> 20:31.664
but none of 'em have a record.
What about Fran?

20:31.698 --> 20:34.401
- Oh, there's no motive,
no evidence.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.835
She didn't have anything
to do with this.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.704
- I gotta believe
we're missing something here.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.905
This kid did not just vanish.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.474
- We both know that
sometimes they just do.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.510
- TARU came through.
- What do you got?

20:43.543 --> 20:47.380
- So this was taken at 4:37 a.m.
three blocks from Nadine's loft,

20:47.414 --> 20:49.349
and Nadine said that
she thought a rug was missing

20:49.382 --> 20:50.617
from Theo's room.
- I'll call the company.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.718
See who has access to that van.
- Okay.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.520
See if Nadine
recognizes that rug.

20:53.553 --> 20:54.587
- And, uh, what about
the other mother?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.589
- Uh, she's in the breakroom.
Send me that picture

20:56.623 --> 20:58.825
and I'll show it to her.
- Listen, I saw Tucker here.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.627
Is everything okay?
- It's fine.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.395
It's just--

21:02.429 --> 21:04.331
you know, we're not--
we're not connecting right now.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.300
We're just missing each other.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.836
- That's too bad.
- Thanks.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.606
[door closes]

21:15.575 --> 21:17.844
- I'm...

21:17.877 --> 21:20.413
I'm not sure.
That could be Theo's rug.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.948
- Do you by chance
recognize the man maybe?

21:21.981 --> 21:23.516
Or--or the vehicle?

21:23.550 --> 21:25.385
- No.

21:27.554 --> 21:29.456
Is that Theo rolled up in there?

21:29.489 --> 21:31.891
- Oh, we don't know.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.926
- Did Gabriel have something
to do with this?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.862
- No, this is a separate lead.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.830
- But you still think
it's my fault?

21:37.864 --> 21:39.732
- Nadine, it's not
all about you.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.601
We are trying
to find your child.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.704
- Do you know how hard it is
to be a single mother?

21:46.373 --> 21:47.907
No backup.

21:47.940 --> 21:51.611
Trying to have some kind
of your own life.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.614
I didn't want Theo
to grow up smothered.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.616
Restricted.
I just wanted him to be happy,

21:56.649 --> 21:58.918
but I can't be there
every single second.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.623
- Then why'd you shut out Fran?

22:06.593 --> 22:09.662
- Maybe I was afraid
he would like her more than me.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.370
- It's me.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.538
Look, I still don't know
what time I'm gonna be home.

22:18.571 --> 22:19.472
I'm so sorry.

22:19.506 --> 22:20.940
I'll let you know as soon
as I can, okay?

22:20.973 --> 22:22.609
Thanks, honey.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.511
- Did you find something?
- Uh, we did

22:24.544 --> 22:26.713
on the security footage.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.848
Does this picture
mean anything to you?

22:28.881 --> 22:31.751
It was taken a couple blocks
from Nadine's apartment,

22:31.784 --> 22:34.387
uh, about 4:30 in the morning.

22:34.421 --> 22:35.922
- That's Theo, isn't it,
in the carpet?

22:35.955 --> 22:37.990
I mean, who loads a truck
at 4:00 in the morning?

22:38.024 --> 22:41.628
- Actually, in New York,
that's not so uncommon.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.829
- Right, right.
[laughs nervously]

22:42.862 --> 22:44.597
- Look, you've got--you've got
a lot on your mind, okay?

22:44.631 --> 22:45.965
- Yeah, I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.667
- Have a seat, okay?
Have a seat.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.968
- Okay, thanks.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.876
You must be used
to talking to people

22:56.909 --> 22:58.044
on the worst night
of their lives.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.780
- I am.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.782
But as a doctor,
I'm sure that you've had

23:02.815 --> 23:05.818
a few rough conversations
yourself.

23:05.852 --> 23:08.455
- Yeah.
[chuckles, sniffles]

23:08.488 --> 23:10.890
When Nadine and I decied
to get pregnant,

23:10.923 --> 23:14.561
one option was that
both of us get inseminated,

23:14.594 --> 23:16.829
and then I thought,
how would that work?

23:16.863 --> 23:18.731
You know, both of us pregnant?

23:18.765 --> 23:20.667
How is that practical?

23:20.700 --> 23:23.603
I really wanted
to take care of her.

23:23.636 --> 23:27.073
- Hey, I certainly understand
the impulse.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.642
- The problem is...
[sighs]

23:29.676 --> 23:31.844
You take care of someone,

23:31.878 --> 23:34.013
you become their mother.

23:34.046 --> 23:37.450
It's not sexy anymore.

23:37.484 --> 23:38.718
They get bored.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.921
They resent you.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.956
[sighs]
No wedding ring.

23:43.990 --> 23:47.460
Are you in a relationship,
Lieutenant?

23:47.494 --> 23:49.462
- Uh, actually--
- I'm so sorry.

23:49.496 --> 23:50.897
[laughs]
I-I shouldn't have asked.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.499
I'm sorry.
- That's okay, that's okay.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.534
I am seeing someone.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.604
- Anybody ever get it right?
[laughs softly]

23:57.637 --> 24:00.006
- That's a good question.
- [laughs]

24:01.608 --> 24:03.009
I really--I really thought

24:03.042 --> 24:05.578
Nadine and I would
be together forever.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.614
That's why I didn't rush
to adopt Theo.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.616
You know, he was...

24:09.649 --> 24:12.719
he was just a baby and...

24:13.686 --> 24:16.589
I was working so much.

24:16.623 --> 24:19.659
I was really busy, so...

24:20.827 --> 24:23.930
Then I looked up one day,
and, uh, bam, he was six,

24:23.963 --> 24:26.933
and I lost my chance.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.902
You think I lost my chance?

24:29.936 --> 24:32.071
- Hey, Lieutenant, we got a list
of employees from Sal and Son.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.139
Nadine recognized a name.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.575
- Oscar Ramirez,
Gloria's brother.

24:35.608 --> 24:36.743
- Gloria Ramirez,
your nanny?

24:36.776 --> 24:39.011
- Her cell goes straight
to voice mail, so does Oscar's,

24:39.045 --> 24:40.847
but his employer says
he lives with his sister.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.014
- Where does your nanny live?

24:42.048 --> 24:43.950
- I-I don't know.
Somewhere in Queens?

24:43.983 --> 24:45.752
I don't have the address.
- I do.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.119
- Great.
Let's go.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.858
- Hey, Gloria,
it's Detective Carisi.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.025
[pounding on door]

24:53.059 --> 24:55.562
- Gloria,
we need to talk to you now.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.670
- Get the bathroom.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.974
Bathroom clear.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.678
- Clear up here.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.680
- It's clear!

25:13.713 --> 25:15.915
- Guys, I got something.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.718
- Well, there's no sign
of Oscar, Theo, or Gloria.

25:41.107 --> 25:41.240
.

25:42.341 --> 25:43.242
- I don't understand.
You think Gloria has Theo?

25:43.275 --> 25:44.176
- We don't know
what we're looking at yet.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.846
- Gloria loves him.
- Well, this shrine,

25:46.879 --> 25:49.682
she seems obsessed.
- Wh--tell them.

25:49.716 --> 25:50.817
We both hired her.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.719
We both saw
how good she was for Theo.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.854
- Nobody's blaming anyone.
- We do need you to tell us

25:54.887 --> 25:57.156
everything that you know
about Gloria.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.925
Right, she's from Mexico, right?
- Yes.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.860
We thought it would be good
for Theo to learn Spanish.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.862
- We found her on Craigslist.
We paid her cash.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.330
She's been with us
since Theo was a baby.

26:04.363 --> 26:05.898
This makes no sense.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.967
Unless things have changed
the past few years.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.636
You always forgot to pay her.
Maybe she's angry.

26:09.669 --> 26:10.837
- No, nothing has changed,
all right?

26:10.870 --> 26:11.938
Maybe she's more religious.
- Yeah, well,

26:11.971 --> 26:14.641
I'm sure she doesn't approve
of your lifestyle, Nadine.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.175
- Okay, we need to know
about Gloria's family.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.810
What about Oscar?
What about family members

26:17.844 --> 26:18.845
that she has in Mexico.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.813
- What are you saying,
they traffic kids in Mexico?

26:20.847 --> 26:22.949
- We're not saying anything.
We're just trying to figure out

26:22.982 --> 26:25.685
what's going on here.
- Maybe Oscar took them both.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.019
- Well, then, has Oscar
ever been to your loft?

26:27.053 --> 26:28.154
Has he ever interacted
with Theo?

26:28.187 --> 26:29.956
- Sometimes he'd
drive Gloria home.

26:29.989 --> 26:32.091
- Well, has he interacted
with Theo, Nadine?

26:32.124 --> 26:34.994
- I don't know.
He always seemed responsible.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.096
- Well, you're right about that.
Oscar just showed up at work

26:37.129 --> 26:38.898
to drop off the van.
- Was Theo with him?

26:38.931 --> 26:40.132
- No.

26:41.668 --> 26:42.902
- I told you
I don't know where they are.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.704
Why you even talking to me?
- Sit down.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.072
- [exhales sharply]

26:46.105 --> 26:47.874
- That's you right there, right?

26:47.907 --> 26:49.676
Is that Theo
rolled up in that rug?

26:49.709 --> 26:52.011
- Listen, Oscar,
we're gonna search that van.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.980
If we find any evidence
that Theo was inside,

26:54.013 --> 26:55.748
you're on the hook
for first-degree kidnapping.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.417
- You better come clean.
That's 15 years, son.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.921
- I just--I just did
what my sister told me to do.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.856
- Okay, go on.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.825
- [exhales] She said Theo's mom
was having a party.

27:05.858 --> 27:08.227
She gave me a key,

27:08.260 --> 27:10.763
said I should wait
for everyone to leave,

27:10.797 --> 27:12.131
then come
and make the room a mess,

27:12.164 --> 27:14.233
take Theo.
- The blood was fresh.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.903
Did you hurt that boy?
- No.

27:16.936 --> 27:18.237
Just a pinprick on his finger.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.673
I swear to God.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.141
- Okay, okay, Oscar.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.810
Where is Gloria taking Theo
right now?

27:23.843 --> 27:25.812
- Why should I tell you?

27:25.845 --> 27:28.014
You should ask Nadine
why this happened.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.182
- Is that what this is about?

27:30.216 --> 27:33.085
You and your sister getting back
at Nadine by taking Theo?

27:33.119 --> 27:34.821
- Well, people get
what they deserve.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.923
- You're gonna get
what you deserve, Oscar.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.090
You're going to prison.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.926
You heard of that Mexican Mafia?

27:39.959 --> 27:43.229
Gonna make sure they know you
like little six-year-old boys.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.798
- I pray for your soul.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.801
- We're done with you.
Call the prosecutor.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.269
- No, no, no.
No, no, no, my sister.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.805
She's...

27:53.973 --> 27:57.476
She gave me cash
to buy her a used car.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.278
- That's good, Oscar.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.447
Give me the make, model,
and year number.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.916
- I give you that,
I get to go?

28:03.950 --> 28:05.151
- You tell me the truth,

28:05.184 --> 28:07.920
we'll take it
into consideration.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.457
Hey, early '90s,
base Toyota Tercel,

28:11.490 --> 28:12.859
bought last week
in an off-record sale

28:12.892 --> 28:14.026
with the plates intact.
Did you get that?

28:14.060 --> 28:15.461
- Got it.
I'm on Craigslist checking ads.

28:15.494 --> 28:16.662
- Think they're taking
the boy to Mexico

28:16.695 --> 28:19.165
to sell him to the cartel?
- They wanted to sell the boy,

28:19.198 --> 28:21.834
they could have done that here.
- Got something.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.870
This.
Tercel for sale in Queens.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.738
Listing's from a week ago.
- Photos?

28:25.772 --> 28:27.106
- Yeah, and...
[exhales]

28:27.139 --> 28:29.876
A license plate number.
NSO7946.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.210
- There it is.
Put out an Amber Alert.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.945
Get Gloria's picture
to the media.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.947
Check the license plate readers
for that car.

28:34.981 --> 28:36.949
We need to find Theo now.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.788
- Yes, a Hispanic woman
with a young child.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.522
I got the alert on my phone.
- This one?

28:43.555 --> 28:45.057
- That's her.
Checked in last night.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.258
Kid was asleep in her arms.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.060
- Okay, and what about the boy?
Is this him?

28:48.094 --> 28:50.129
- Yeah, looks like him.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.166
Car's gone.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.168
- You didn't say
she checked out.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.269
- She didn't.

28:57.303 --> 28:58.838
Uh, let me call
the front office.

28:58.871 --> 29:01.040
- Whoa, hold on.
What room was she in?

29:06.078 --> 29:07.847
- We missed 'em.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.248
- Looks like she left
in a hurry.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.516
She's onto us.

29:10.549 --> 29:13.119
Maybe she saw herself
on the news.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.327
- It's directions to Juarez.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.964
- So she's headed to the border.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.269
- The manager talked to a motel
guest who saw a Hispanic woman

29:30.302 --> 29:32.271
put a boy in the backseat
of a Toyota around 10:00 a.m.

29:32.304 --> 29:33.873
- And this guy
didn't call the police?

29:33.906 --> 29:35.074
- He said the kid seemed okay.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.242
- Hey, Liv, we got something.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.010
A license plate reader
on a tow truck

29:38.044 --> 29:39.879
just tagged the car.
It's a breakdown.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.580
- Where?
- A gas station off I-95.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.882
15 miles from here.

29:42.915 --> 29:43.950
- That's not much of
a headstart.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.885
- We need to get to
that gas station immediately

29:45.918 --> 29:48.187
before she
does something desperate.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.300
[car doors close]

30:01.333 --> 30:03.202
- Get back.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.273
- Nobody's here.
- Check the trunk.

30:09.608 --> 30:10.910
- It's empty.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.278
- Where are they?
- I don't know, man.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.380
I just work here.

30:17.950 --> 30:18.918
- Gloria!
- [gasps]

30:18.951 --> 30:20.186
Go, come on, come on,
come on, come on, go, go!

30:20.219 --> 30:21.387
- Gloria!

30:21.420 --> 30:23.822
- Go, go, go!

30:25.324 --> 30:28.194
Come on!
- Whoa, careful!

30:28.227 --> 30:29.862
- [gasps, breathing heavily]

30:29.896 --> 30:31.597
- Gloria, there's
no place to go, all right?

30:31.630 --> 30:33.632
- Let go of the boy.
- Gloria, let him go.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.201
- Gloria, put him down.
- No, no, no, no!

30:35.234 --> 30:38.204
- Put the boy down.
- No, I don't wanna go home!

30:38.237 --> 30:39.405
I want Gloria!
- Theo--

30:39.438 --> 30:42.074
- Please, no.
No, please, don't do this.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.210
- [straining]
- No, please.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.212
- No.
I want you, Gloria!

30:46.245 --> 30:47.980
- [sobbing]
- Theo...it's okay.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.448
- Theo, we gotta get you home,
okay?

30:49.481 --> 30:52.084
- It's okay, sweetheart.
We gotta go.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.086
Come on.
- No, no, no, no!

30:54.120 --> 30:56.322
- It's okay.
- No, no, please!

30:56.355 --> 30:58.090
- We're gonna take you
to your mom, honey.

31:04.496 --> 31:04.630
.

31:05.097 --> 31:05.664
- Oh, God, Theo.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.633
Oh, thank God.
- What--

31:07.666 --> 31:10.269
- Is he okay?
- The doctor says he's fine.

31:10.302 --> 31:11.437
- I want Gloria.
- Theo--

31:11.470 --> 31:12.371
- I know you do, honey.
- Gloria?

31:12.404 --> 31:14.173
What are you talking about,
sweetheart?

31:14.206 --> 31:17.043
- Nadine, Fran, listen.
- Theo?

31:17.076 --> 31:19.578
- Listen, we need to--
we need to question Theo,

31:19.611 --> 31:21.380
and it's best
if we do it by himself,

31:21.413 --> 31:24.250
alone, with you two not here.
He may not be as forthcoming.

31:24.283 --> 31:27.519
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
I just wanna take him home.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.121
- Nadine, Nadine.
Let them do their jobs.

31:29.155 --> 31:31.090
- Theo, you wanna go home
right now, right?

31:31.123 --> 31:32.558
- Okay, listen, we are speaking
with her ight now.

31:32.591 --> 31:35.527
Thank you.
- Theo, Mommy'll be right back.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.465
- Theo was endangered.
I had to take him.

31:39.498 --> 31:40.699
- Why did you have to take him?

31:40.732 --> 31:42.534
- She was going to take him
to Ibiza.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.436
- She's the parent.
It's her decision.

31:44.470 --> 31:47.206
- He would die there.

31:48.707 --> 31:51.443
She wouldn't pay attention.

31:51.477 --> 31:54.280
Partying with her friends.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.682
He'd wander off.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.488
We went to a party
in the Hamptons.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.324
Theo fell in a pool.

32:05.357 --> 32:08.160
Nobody watching.

32:08.194 --> 32:10.329
He could have drowned.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.164
- But you were watching.

32:12.198 --> 32:13.665
You saved him.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.135
- I jumped in the pool
with all of my clothes on.

32:16.168 --> 32:20.106
I was so scared.

32:20.139 --> 32:23.209
[crying]

32:30.616 --> 32:34.153
I am the one
who cooks him dinner.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.256
I know how he likes
his rice and beans.

32:37.289 --> 32:41.227
Exactly half and half.
Not touching on the plate.

32:43.662 --> 32:47.599
I know how he likes
to get tucked into bed at night.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.545
Theo...

33:01.313 --> 33:04.450
Theo wanted to be with me.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.519
He wanted to go to Mexico.

33:07.553 --> 33:11.490
My family has a ranch
with goats and chickens.

33:11.523 --> 33:14.593
He would have been
so happy there.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.698
- I believe he would have been,

33:19.731 --> 33:21.600
but what you did is a crime.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.535
- No.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.771
[sobbing]

33:25.804 --> 33:29.441
I'm sorry.

33:29.475 --> 33:32.544
I'm so sorry.

33:35.647 --> 33:38.784
- Gloria was going to take me
to a farm with real goats,

33:38.817 --> 33:41.187
so I didn't have to go to Ibiza.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.722
'Cause then I'd never
see her again.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.491
- Is that what she told you?

33:45.524 --> 33:47.459
- Yep, and she always
tells the truth.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.728
She says God's listening.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.597
- So can you tell us the truth?
What happened?

33:51.630 --> 33:54.800
How did you end up
in Gloria's car?

33:54.833 --> 33:56.468
- Well, Oscar took me.

33:56.502 --> 34:00.372
- So Oscar came
into your room that night?

34:00.406 --> 34:01.640
- Yeah.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.809
It was kind of like a game.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.578
- Can you tell us about that?

34:06.612 --> 34:08.647
- I was supposed
to pretend to be a mummy.

34:08.680 --> 34:11.583
Oscar rolled me into my rug.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.686
- So you and Oscar were just--
were just playing.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.622
- It was fun.

34:16.655 --> 34:19.758
We got in a van
and we met Gloria at a motel.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.527
I got to watch cartoons.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.362
- And what did Gloria tell you?

34:23.395 --> 34:24.763
- We had to wait
a few days.

34:24.796 --> 34:26.665
Then we could drive to Mexico.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.367
We could live there.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.736
Me, her,

34:30.769 --> 34:33.539
and the goats.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.377
Where is Gloria?
Is she okay?

34:38.410 --> 34:40.312
- You know,
I'm gonna go find out right now,

34:40.346 --> 34:43.715
and you stay here and talk
to Detective Rollins, okay?

34:43.749 --> 34:45.817
- Okay.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.857
- He said he wants
to go to Mexico with Gloria?

34:51.890 --> 34:53.492
- He did.
- Nadine...

34:53.525 --> 34:55.527
Theo is not hurt.

34:55.561 --> 34:56.895
That's what's important.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.431
So what's going
to happen to Gloria?

34:59.465 --> 35:01.467
- Well, she will be charged
with kidnapping,

35:01.500 --> 35:03.535
but given the circumstances,

35:03.569 --> 35:05.837
our ADA will probably
offer her a deal.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.773
- So Gloria is
out of Theo's life

35:07.806 --> 35:09.575
even though that's not
what Theo wants?

35:09.608 --> 35:12.678
- Yes.
- So I'll hire another nanny.

35:12.711 --> 35:13.845
All right?
I just wanna take my son home.

35:13.879 --> 35:17.449
Everything's gonna be okay.
- Were you even listening?

35:17.483 --> 35:18.650
Nothing is okay.

35:18.684 --> 35:21.353
- I am still his mother.

35:21.387 --> 35:22.688
- Yes, you are,

35:22.721 --> 35:25.424
but with everything
that's happened,

35:25.457 --> 35:29.395
Child Services is now involved.

35:29.428 --> 35:30.596
- Wait, so I can't take him?

35:30.629 --> 35:34.433
- Not right now.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.835
- Then--then let me take him.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.405
I-I don't--I don't want Theo
staying with strangers.

35:39.438 --> 35:41.807
- I'm afraid
that's not possible.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.844
- Right.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.546
I'm not Theo's parent.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.481
Not in the eyes of the law.

35:49.515 --> 35:52.651
Not yet, anyway.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.620
- I'm sorry.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.795
- Ready, Theo?
- That's really good.

36:05.397 --> 36:07.766
- You'll be coming with me.
- For how long?

36:07.799 --> 36:09.935
- Well, there will be
a family court hearing

36:09.968 --> 36:12.538
first thing in the morning.

36:12.571 --> 36:15.774
- Let's say good-bye, Nadine.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.844
- I love you.
[laughs softly]

36:18.877 --> 36:21.713
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

36:23.915 --> 36:26.785
- See you tomorrow too, Fran?
- Yes, you will.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.387
I promise.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.921
- Bye.

36:29.955 --> 36:32.624
- I love you, Theo.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.966
What happens now?

36:40.999 --> 36:44.570
- Social Services will interview
Nadine and then Theo,

36:44.603 --> 36:46.472
and then inspect the home.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.906
- Oh, God.
- Listen.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.376
Family court judges
tend to rule in favor

36:50.409 --> 36:52.878
of the custodial parent.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.846
- I'll help you.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.916
I'll testify in court
that you're a good person

36:57.949 --> 37:00.752
and a good mother,

37:00.786 --> 37:03.955
but Theo needs both of us
in his life.

37:05.991 --> 37:08.594
- I thought Theo
didn't need two mommies.

37:08.627 --> 37:11.497
- He does.

37:11.530 --> 37:14.533
- I know.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.934
I'm sorry, Fran.

37:15.967 --> 37:19.638
I just--
I was just--

37:19.671 --> 37:21.473
- [sniffles]

37:21.507 --> 37:23.675
We almost lost him forever.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.750
- You guys are still here?

37:31.783 --> 37:35.487
- I'm walking you out.
- Go home.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.556
Paperwork can wait
till tomorrow.

37:37.589 --> 37:38.990
- Copy, Lieutenant.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.728
- Good night.

37:45.564 --> 37:46.632
- What?

37:46.665 --> 37:47.766
- I know what you're thinking,
Amanda,

37:47.799 --> 37:49.468
and you're wrong.

37:49.501 --> 37:52.671
You're a great mother.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.440
- I'm not so sure.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.908
- Well, I am.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.010
- I--

37:59.044 --> 38:02.581
it just gets lonely sometimes.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.882
- Jesse still up?

38:03.915 --> 38:05.984
- Yep, uh, sitter said she was.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.453
- All right, well,
let's go get some groceries.

38:07.486 --> 38:08.854
I wanna make spaghetti
for all three of us,

38:08.887 --> 38:10.088
and then we're gonna watch

38:10.121 --> 38:12.090
some terrible reality TV.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.726
I mean, it is gonna be so bad.

38:14.760 --> 38:15.994
- You got nothing better to do?

38:16.027 --> 38:17.095
- No, I do not.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.730
Here.
Take your coat.

38:18.764 --> 38:21.032
Let's go.
- Okay.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.901
- Come on.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.472
- Don't forget
to brush your teeth,

38:26.505 --> 38:28.507
top and bottom, okay?

38:28.540 --> 38:29.675
Good night, sweetie.
I'll be right in.

38:29.708 --> 38:30.976
Mwah.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.812
- Bye, Tucker.

38:33.845 --> 38:34.813
- Night, night, Noah.

38:34.846 --> 38:38.584
- All right, go on.
Be right in, sweet boy.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.586
Go in.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.854
- [sighs deeply]

38:44.523 --> 38:47.693
So, can I ask...

38:47.726 --> 38:50.696
what's going on with me and you?

38:50.729 --> 38:51.897
Is it that dinner
when I told you

38:51.930 --> 38:55.000
I was thinking about retiring?
- No.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.870
Yes.
I-I don't know.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.806
[sighs]

39:00.839 --> 39:03.909
- But I'm not imagining it?
- No.

39:05.544 --> 39:08.046
No, you're not.

39:12.951 --> 39:16.788
You know, maybe we're--
we're, um...

39:16.822 --> 39:20.058
in different places right now.

39:20.091 --> 39:22.127
I did get a little scared

39:22.160 --> 39:25.697
about the retirement thing,

39:25.731 --> 39:27.032
and, Ed, you know, this job,

39:27.065 --> 39:30.636
this is...

39:30.669 --> 39:32.738
this is who I am.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.840
- I know.

39:36.975 --> 39:39.945
When, uh...

39:39.978 --> 39:41.980
when I was at IAB,

39:42.013 --> 39:44.750
I learned to listen.

39:46.852 --> 39:49.688
To know when people
are telling me who they are.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.891
What they're really thinking.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.693
A few months ago,

39:54.726 --> 39:57.763
you said you were happy,

39:57.796 --> 40:00.065
but you were crying.

40:00.098 --> 40:03.068
You were afraid
it wasn't gonna last.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.904
- I remember.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.707
- You were telling me the truth.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.876
That we weren't gonna last.

40:12.978 --> 40:15.113
- [quietly]
I tried, Ed.

40:15.146 --> 40:17.983
And I know you tried too.

40:19.651 --> 40:23.689
But if we've both
been trying this hard...

40:27.158 --> 40:29.895
I have this little boy who--
who needs me.

40:29.928 --> 40:33.799
Who needs his mother,

40:33.832 --> 40:36.802
and I have to give him...

40:36.835 --> 40:39.871
all the attention
and all the time

40:39.905 --> 40:43.909
and--and all the love
that I have.

40:46.912 --> 40:49.948
- He has to be your priority
right now.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.151
I get that.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.153
I do.

40:55.186 --> 40:58.056
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

41:14.305 --> 41:17.709
Take care of yourself,
Olivia Benson.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.057
- Mommy.
