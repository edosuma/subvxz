You forgot to say,
"it's hero time."

00:34.267 --> 00:38.670
Sorry, kid.
No time for autographs.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.405
Huh?

00:51.152 --> 00:53.256
Hot, hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

00:53.292 --> 00:56.693
<i>Ben Tennyson,
I demand that you ...</i>

00:56.728 --> 00:59.832
Dude, I don't have time
for fan boys right now.

00:59.901 --> 01:03.636
We're in the middle of fight here!

01:17.148 --> 01:20.184
Halt!

01:20.252 --> 01:24.890
Um, Ben, I do not
believe this is a fan boy.

01:24.925 --> 01:28.360
Ha!
Furthest thing from it, in fact.

01:28.395 --> 01:29.994
I just wanted you to acknowledge

01:30.029 --> 01:33.898
me as your
arch-nemesis and destroyer.

01:33.933 --> 01:38.535
And now that that's out of the
way, Humungo-bore...

01:38.570 --> 01:40.304
Attack.

02:10.095 --> 02:11.196
Huh?

02:11.231 --> 02:14.199
I don't know you're
controlling those things,

02:14.234 --> 02:18.872
but tell them to back off.

02:18.941 --> 02:20.507
Unh-unh.

02:20.542 --> 02:24.312
Ben, that child may, in fact,
be an adversary, rather than a ...

02:24.347 --> 02:25.712
Duck!
- Where?

02:50.141 --> 02:51.040
Missed!

02:51.076 --> 02:54.177
Close one.

02:54.246 --> 02:57.548
This is not safe.
You must leave.

02:57.583 --> 03:01.785
No!
I want to see Tennyson suffer.

03:07.425 --> 03:10.360
Hold still, you big lizard!

03:48.034 --> 03:51.002
All right.
Start talking, kid ... now!

03:51.037 --> 03:53.672
Who are you?

03:59.612 --> 04:03.148
Of course.
You don't even remember me.

04:03.183 --> 04:05.317
Hello!
I'm Billy Billions.

04:05.386 --> 04:06.952
We were in middle school together.

04:07.021 --> 04:09.321
I sat behind you in
Mrs. Rheault's class.

04:15.796 --> 04:20.934
<i>I was richer than you.
I was smarter than you.</i>

04:24.905 --> 04:29.410
<i>I should have been
running that school.</i>

04:40.028 --> 04:44.064
Now do you remember?
- Um, no.

04:44.133 --> 04:48.702
Then maybe you'll
remember this!

04:55.778 --> 04:59.146
<i>You weren't smarter than me.
You were just lucky.</i>

04:59.215 --> 05:04.985
<i>So I decided to show
you up once and for all!</i>

05:15.432 --> 05:18.434
Wait.
So instead of zapping me,

05:18.469 --> 05:22.638
you got sucked into dimension 12?

05:26.144 --> 05:29.445
Not funny.
- Oh, come on, man.

05:29.514 --> 05:31.815
You got to admit, it's
a little bit funny.

05:32.851 --> 05:36.621
I don't got to admit
anything! I said it's not funny!

05:39.158 --> 05:43.829
<i>There I was, stranded in a
dimension where time stood still.</i>

05:43.897 --> 05:49.001
<i>A place where all organic life
had been hunted into extinction.</i>

05:49.070 --> 05:53.973
<i>Destroy all flesh and the
works of flesh.</i>

06:03.817 --> 06:05.650
<i>You know the worst part?</i>

06:05.686 --> 06:08.719
<i>That five years of
isolation drove you crazy?</i>

06:08.755 --> 06:12.189
That five years of
isolation drove me ... no!

06:12.258 --> 06:14.325
The worst part is, because of dimension

06:14.326 --> 06:16.393
12's weirdo time
effect, I stopped aging.

06:16.461 --> 06:19.396
So I'm stuck looking like this!

06:19.464 --> 06:24.000
<i>My body stopped growing,
but not my brain.</i>

06:24.035 --> 06:27.170
<i>I'm a genius, by the
way, born of geniuses.</i>

06:27.206 --> 06:31.908
<i>My parents basically
invented modern robotics.</i>

06:38.515 --> 06:45.821
<i>Destroy all flesh and the
works of flesh.</i>

06:58.735 --> 07:04.107
After that, reopening the portal
to Earth was only a matter of time.

07:04.142 --> 07:07.945
Huh? Sorry, what?
- Weren't you listening?!

07:07.980 --> 07:10.247
When you're a
world-famous superhero, you've

07:10.283 --> 07:12.950
heard one "blah blah blah" evil
tirade, you've heard them all.

07:12.985 --> 07:17.421
"World-famous"?
- Yes.

07:17.490 --> 07:21.158
According to Ben, he has saved
the universe billions of times.

07:21.193 --> 07:23.160
At least.

07:23.196 --> 07:26.764
Of course you became
world famous.

07:26.800 --> 07:32.237
Why wouldn't you be?

07:32.306 --> 07:38.076
That all changes ... right now!

07:43.550 --> 07:46.352
I feel... weird.

07:50.825 --> 07:55.061
What's going on?
Rook, you okay?

07:55.097 --> 07:57.798
I am entirely not sure.

07:58.199 --> 08:00.500
How embarrassing.

08:00.535 --> 08:04.137
Dude, you have a tail.
- That is the only

08:04.172 --> 08:06.072
thing you notice about our
predicament?

08:06.141 --> 08:09.743
Your voice is kind
of weird, too.

08:13.203 --> 08:18.707
Seriously, Rook,
you have a tail!

08:18.742 --> 08:23.446
I'm Inthak. It...
falls off at puberty. Stop that.

08:23.481 --> 08:26.048
Stop that right now.
Stop that!

08:26.084 --> 08:29.251
Just a little something
I cooked up when I was

08:29.287 --> 08:32.988
stranded in dimension 12.
Now you know it feels to be

08:33.024 --> 08:37.826
stuck looking like a kid
for the rest of your life!

08:37.895 --> 08:42.464
Just some kid that nobody knows.

08:42.533 --> 08:44.099
Change us back!

08:44.168 --> 08:47.736
You don't scare me, Tennyson.
I've seen you in action.

08:47.805 --> 08:51.740
You can't even control that thing.

08:51.776 --> 08:55.278
Hey, no matter
what I turn into, I'll still be

08:55.346 --> 08:59.549
able to take you down.
- Like I'd give you a chance.

09:03.356 --> 09:04.922
Rook, run!

09:15.102 --> 09:18.403
<i>Error. Biometric data
does not match Ben Tennyson.</i>

09:18.471 --> 09:20.104
That's
because I'm 11 again!

09:20.173 --> 09:21.639
What do you want from me?

09:21.675 --> 09:25.843
<i>Error. Vocal pattern
does not match Ben Tennyson.</i>

09:25.878 --> 09:28.479
<i>Please provide alternate
identification.</i>

09:28.514 --> 09:31.516
I'm Benjamin Kirby
Tennyson. I live in Bellwood.

09:31.584 --> 09:33.918
My grandfather's name is
Max Tennyson.

09:33.953 --> 09:36.894
I like soccer and chili fries and...

09:36.895 --> 09:38.855
I'm scared of peacocks!

09:38.891 --> 09:41.758
<i>Identity confirmed.
Thank you.</i>

09:45.030 --> 09:47.665
Ballweevil!

09:58.443 --> 10:02.646
This is a piece of cake.
Hey, Mazuma, who's more famous?

10:02.681 --> 10:07.851
The superhero or the
guy who destroys him?

10:50.730 --> 10:52.530
I advise you to surrender.

10:52.566 --> 10:56.000
I have injured all of your extremities.

10:56.069 --> 10:59.503
Almost all.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.322
You okay?

11:18.357 --> 11:22.627
Yes. However, our foes
have left the scene.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.697
We should go to headquarters.

11:25.732 --> 11:28.800
Perhaps the Plumbers
can return us to normal.

11:28.835 --> 11:30.369
Good idea.

11:48.522 --> 11:52.392
Yes, I am
Ben Tennyson, superhero.

11:52.461 --> 11:56.163
Saved the world a few times.
Maybe you've heard of me.

11:58.768 --> 12:01.802
O.M.G.!
That is so adorable!

12:01.837 --> 12:05.039
"I'm a superhero.
Maybe you've heard of me."

12:07.244 --> 12:10.812
What was that thing
you said back at the library?

12:10.847 --> 12:13.048
How embarrassing?
- Bingo.

12:13.116 --> 12:16.384
Blukic and Driba are
working as fast as they can.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.386
Then they
have to work faster.

12:18.421 --> 12:20.855
I need to be normal so I can
battle Billy Billions and his

12:20.924 --> 12:23.290
bionic babysitter.
- Patience, Ben.

12:23.326 --> 12:26.678
I know that you're worried,
but we're doing everything

12:26.679 --> 12:30.030
possible to help. I
promise, it will be okay.

12:30.065 --> 12:31.398
Come on, grandpa.

12:31.467 --> 12:35.836
I just look like I'm 11,
but I'm still 16 ... in here.

12:35.871 --> 12:40.776
Well, then, in that case,
stop whining and act your age.

12:41.811 --> 12:43.878
What are you guys
doing to Rook?

12:43.947 --> 12:46.681
We are about to reverse
the de-aging effect.

12:46.750 --> 12:50.284
Obviously.

12:53.523 --> 12:57.758
<i>Yadity-yadity!</i>

12:59.729 --> 13:04.865
As we said, we have no clue
how to reverse the de-aging effect.

13:04.901 --> 13:07.702
Obviously.
- Well, it looks like our

13:07.771 --> 13:10.438
only choice is to get that
de-ager away from Billy.

13:10.473 --> 13:12.774
Works for me.
You in, Rook?

13:12.809 --> 13:14.484
Obviously.

13:20.783 --> 13:24.152
<i>Once the projector's
working again, I'll use it to</i>

13:24.188 --> 13:27.056
<i>send Ben into dimension 12 forever.</i>

13:27.091 --> 13:30.859
Then I'll be the winner,
and he'll be the loser.

13:30.895 --> 13:34.300
And then what?
- Then I can take my Revenger

13:34.335 --> 13:37.500
against everyone in Bellwood
who ever gave me a hard time.

13:37.535 --> 13:41.604
That's right, lunch lady!
You're next.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.974
<i>Hey, robots, what's the holdup?</i>

13:44.009 --> 13:46.243
What part of "hurry up" don't
you understand?

13:49.749 --> 13:53.284
I said faster!
Faster! Faster!

13:53.319 --> 13:55.821
I said faster!

14:02.527 --> 14:04.894
Yowch!

14:10.633 --> 14:15.036
<i>This realm is overrun with
useless organic life-forms.</i>

14:15.372 --> 14:19.708
<i>Activate the portal projector
and initialize invasion protocol.</i>

14:19.743 --> 14:24.446
<i>This dimension must be sterilized.</i>

14:24.481 --> 14:29.084
How dare you.
Halt! Halt, I say!

14:29.119 --> 14:31.887
I am your master.
Obey me!

14:35.925 --> 14:39.094
<i>Destroy all flesh
and the works of flesh.</i>

14:39.129 --> 14:42.998
Stop! Cease! Desist!
I command you!

14:50.506 --> 14:53.575
<i>Destroy all flesh
and the works of flesh.</i>

14:53.644 --> 14:56.545
<i>Destroy all flesh and
the works of flesh.</i>

15:06.100 --> 15:08.401
Billions
technology tower.

15:08.437 --> 15:11.271
The kid's got his own skyscraper?

15:11.306 --> 15:14.942
What's he so jealous of me for?

15:21.216 --> 15:24.217
I knew you wouldn't leave me.

15:27.188 --> 15:30.323
Ahem!
Ben Tennyson.

15:30.359 --> 15:34.594
Well, I hate to seem rude,
but... I have a dentist's

15:34.663 --> 15:37.964
appointment, so if you'll excuse me.
- Not so fast!

15:39.267 --> 15:40.866
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

15:40.935 --> 15:42.234
Drop him!

15:42.269 --> 15:44.570
Master Billy?
- Okay, okay.

15:44.605 --> 15:46.472
You let me go, and she'll let you go.

15:46.507 --> 15:48.840
Ow, ow, ow!
Uhh!

15:48.876 --> 15:53.878
Let me guess. Dimension 12 robots
plus big explosion equals your

15:53.914 --> 15:56.314
super-genius brain screwing up royally.

15:56.382 --> 16:00.165
I had everything under control!

16:00.166 --> 16:04.957
Come on! Let me see!
I bet I could figure out how it works.

16:04.992 --> 16:07.894
The proto-tool is
a very complicated mechanism.

16:07.929 --> 16:10.897
Come on!
- I can't believe

16:10.966 --> 16:13.801
you built your tower right next
to Captain Nemesis' building.

16:13.869 --> 16:18.439
Yeah, except my building
is taller than his building.

16:18.508 --> 16:20.174
Why does that matter?

16:20.209 --> 16:23.177
You keep trying to prove that
you're better than everybody else.

16:23.246 --> 16:25.445
But what happens?
You end up making this huge mess

16:25.514 --> 16:27.348
that you don't even know how to fix.

16:27.383 --> 16:32.519
I'll think of something.
After all, I am a super-genius.

16:32.555 --> 16:33.887
Based on what?

16:33.956 --> 16:37.057
'Cause you brought dimension 12
robots here to attack me?

16:37.092 --> 16:40.593
Oh, brilliant.
Except Nemesis did it first.

16:40.629 --> 16:43.630
Even that pocket watch
is a wannabe Omnitrix.

16:43.665 --> 16:47.166
Honestly, have you ever
had an original idea?

16:47.202 --> 16:49.802
I came up with
"I.Q. Lad" myself.

16:49.871 --> 16:52.805
What is that?
Your super-villain name?

16:52.840 --> 16:58.077
As a matter of fact, it is.
- Well, it's super-lame.

16:58.112 --> 17:00.446
Like you could come up
with something better?

17:00.481 --> 17:03.548
Look, you think
you're an evil genius, right?

17:03.617 --> 17:07.185
Then go for something like ...
I don't know ... "Whiz Kid"

17:07.253 --> 17:10.288
or "Wits' End" or...
"Brain Power."

17:10.357 --> 17:12.991
Ooh!
That is a good one.

17:13.059 --> 17:14.925
I didn't
say you could use it.

17:14.961 --> 17:16.794
Then why did
you even mention it?

17:16.829 --> 17:20.163
To prove that you're not
as smart as you think you are, Billy!

17:20.199 --> 17:22.465
You're just a spoiled brat, Billy!

17:22.534 --> 17:25.836
A petty, jealous copycat, Billy!

17:25.871 --> 17:27.369
At least you know my name now.

17:27.406 --> 17:29.460
Could you settle this

17:29.461 --> 17:32.542
after we stop a
pan-dimensional invasion?

17:33.844 --> 17:36.913
As soon as we're
inside, you get the de-ager and

17:36.982 --> 17:39.616
turn us back to normal.
Then we'll stop the robots.

17:39.651 --> 17:44.287
No. First, we stop the robots.
Then, I turn you back.

17:48.326 --> 17:51.761
These guys could
use a blast from Shocksquatch.

17:51.830 --> 17:55.052
Come on, Shocksquatch!

17:55.053 --> 17:57.200
How about...

17:57.269 --> 18:01.271
Shocksquatch?
It's me, Omnitrix.

18:01.306 --> 18:04.474
<i>Hello? Anything?</i>

18:04.543 --> 18:07.744
Blox?!
- Oh! Well, that's useful.

18:07.779 --> 18:11.314
You just have to be
smart enough to adapt, Billy.

18:11.350 --> 18:16.653
<i>Quiet. They might hear you.</i>

18:29.735 --> 18:33.304
What are you doing?
- I'm ... I'm thinking.

18:33.339 --> 18:37.876
<i> While ben Tennyson
steals the spotlight, as usual.</i>

18:37.944 --> 18:40.945
Not this time.

19:03.666 --> 19:07.869
Hey, Tennyson!
Looky what I got.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.438
Billy! Look out!

19:15.044 --> 19:19.313
Please be careful
with that device.

19:40.136 --> 19:46.443
You're going nowhere
fast, dish heads!

19:47.478 --> 19:52.348
Again?! I have got to
put a better grip on that thing.

19:52.384 --> 19:55.452
Cool!

19:55.487 --> 19:59.056
<i>Destroy all flesh and the
works of flesh.</i>

19:59.091 --> 20:02.059
No, Billy!
Grab the de-ager!

20:02.095 --> 20:04.562
Huh?
What?

20:04.630 --> 20:07.998
I told
you it was complicated.

20:53.077 --> 20:55.644
<i>I did it.
I did it!</i>

20:55.680 --> 20:59.482
<i>I overloaded the portal
generator. I saved the Earth.</i>

20:59.551 --> 21:02.385
After having
been the one who doomed it.

21:02.454 --> 21:05.589
I saved the world!
Ha ha. Me!

21:05.658 --> 21:08.592
Billy Billions.
I mean, I.Q. Lad. I mean ...

21:08.627 --> 21:10.327
Been there, done that.

21:10.362 --> 21:11.495
A billion times.

21:11.564 --> 21:15.299
I did it this time ...
not you, Ben Tennyson!

21:15.335 --> 21:18.470
Me! Me!
Meeee!

21:21.208 --> 21:23.308
That's gonna hurt
when he wakes up.

21:23.377 --> 21:26.578
The de-aging ray.
Ready to say goodbye to that tail?

21:26.613 --> 21:30.115
I do not know.
I was just getting used to it again.

21:31.350 --> 21:32.951
I am over it.

21:32.986 --> 21:34.686
<i>Ben, what happened in there?</i>

21:34.721 --> 21:37.889
Guys, guys, please.
One at a time.

21:37.924 --> 21:41.793
<i>- Was it Captain Nemesis?
- Will you show us one of your aliens?</i>

21:41.861 --> 21:45.663
It's not fair!
It's not fair!

21:45.698 --> 21:48.232
I did all the work!
I saved the world!

21:48.301 --> 21:51.402
And he gets all the credit!
Again!

21:51.437 --> 21:53.871
Stop whining, Billy.

21:53.906 --> 21:57.340
Act your age.
- Yeah. Grow up, will you?
