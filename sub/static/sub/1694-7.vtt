00:01.027 --> 00:03.028
I need your help to arrange a loan.

00:03.062 --> 00:04.382
There's the house for collateral.

00:04.383 --> 00:06.097
- You don't own the house.
- My son does.

00:06.131 --> 00:10.001
Before anything else, the process
of having him declared dead...

00:10.036 --> 00:11.703
He's prone to long disappearances.

00:11.737 --> 00:13.571
<i>We've been through this, Gillian.</i>

00:13.605 --> 00:15.940
If I could just leave some of these here.

00:19.178 --> 00:20.779
Why don't we just...

00:20.813 --> 00:22.581
Why don't we discuss this later?

00:22.615 --> 00:23.848
There's no need.

00:26.586 --> 00:28.654
When your father left his jacket

00:28.689 --> 00:30.256
this fell out of the pocket.

00:30.290 --> 00:33.058
This was my brother's.
He died in the Argonne.

00:33.093 --> 00:34.759
My father can't forgive that.

00:34.794 --> 00:36.554
I tried to stop them.
They wouldn't listen.

00:36.555 --> 00:39.697
<i>'Cause they were under orders</i>
<i>to get you what you paid for.</i>

00:39.732 --> 00:41.199
Thanks for your input.

00:41.233 --> 00:43.201
How long have you
known Mr. Rosetti?

00:43.236 --> 00:44.470
He kicks up to Joe Masseria.

00:44.504 --> 00:47.840
With whom I have a very delicate truce.

00:47.874 --> 00:50.076
<i>What might solve a problem for you,</i>

00:50.110 --> 00:53.079
<i>creates a bigger one for me.</i>

00:53.113 --> 00:55.348
- What's your name?
- Roger.

00:55.382 --> 00:57.717
You remind me of someone.

00:57.751 --> 00:59.685
I'm gonna call you James.

00:59.719 --> 01:01.954
- Why James?
- He was a king.

01:01.988 --> 01:04.089
- Good night.
- Wait.

01:04.123 --> 01:06.157
I don't think it's wise.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.325
Don't we both know how to keep a secret?

Is that you?

04:29.663 --> 04:31.331
Yes.

04:31.365 --> 04:33.800
You did as I said?

04:33.835 --> 04:37.337
The only one still
in the house is the cook.

04:37.371 --> 04:41.374
I'm not paying her to loaf
about with nothing to do.

04:42.576 --> 04:44.811
- Tell her to go.
- All right.

04:44.845 --> 04:47.614
This event of yours...

04:47.648 --> 04:51.084
It's for the men from the Legion Hall.

04:51.118 --> 04:53.953
I suppose you have some
sort of bond with them.

04:53.988 --> 04:56.389
Trenches and such?

04:56.424 --> 04:58.558
I wasn't in the trenches.

04:58.593 --> 05:00.727
I was a sharpshooter.

05:00.762 --> 05:04.164
In any case, Tommy's not to be subjected

05:04.199 --> 05:06.934
to any rough language.

05:06.968 --> 05:10.237
At the first sign of crude
behavior, you're to leave.

05:10.271 --> 05:13.240
Take him to the Blenheim.

05:13.274 --> 05:17.378
<i>They set a proper Easter table there.</i>

05:17.412 --> 05:20.247
There's $10 in my purse.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.384
Go on.

05:35.396 --> 05:37.030
How are you feeling?

05:38.432 --> 05:40.334
Murderous.

05:40.368 --> 05:43.804
A man has no idea what we
go through every month.

05:43.838 --> 05:45.506
Can I help?

05:45.540 --> 05:48.309
I just want to be left alone

05:48.343 --> 05:50.912
and sit in the dark.

05:50.946 --> 05:53.915
It's a terrible day for business anyway.

05:53.949 --> 05:56.351
All these family gatherings.

05:56.385 --> 05:58.987
It makes the customers feel guilty.

06:19.842 --> 06:22.477
<i>Kathleen, Nora,</i>

06:22.511 --> 06:24.512
Anne, Edith,

06:24.546 --> 06:27.648
Brian, Patrick, Dermott.

06:27.683 --> 06:29.216
And the oldest is Willie.

06:29.251 --> 06:31.285
How do you know their names?

06:31.319 --> 06:34.454
Mama told me.
It's not hard to remember.

06:34.489 --> 06:36.323
Who's our uncle again?

06:38.325 --> 06:41.394
I know everybody's name by heart.

06:41.428 --> 06:43.463
You'll make a fine politician someday.

06:43.497 --> 06:45.398
A girl can't be a politician.

06:45.432 --> 06:47.099
Doesn't England have queens?

06:47.134 --> 06:48.801
Are we all ready?

06:50.037 --> 06:52.138
Then let's go meet your cousins.

07:01.180 --> 07:03.448
You always leave your front door open?

07:04.984 --> 07:07.886
That depends on whom I'm expecting.

07:14.895 --> 07:17.195
Wasn't sure I had the right address.

07:17.230 --> 07:20.132
I hope you're sure now.

07:20.166 --> 07:22.801
Is this really where you live?

07:22.836 --> 07:24.904
My late husband left it to me.

07:24.938 --> 07:26.072
<i>Never said you was married.</i>

07:26.106 --> 07:28.275
It was a troubled relationship

07:28.309 --> 07:30.878
full of sunlight and shadow.

07:30.912 --> 07:32.379
You're talking funny.

07:32.414 --> 07:34.381
Perhaps it's the day.

07:34.416 --> 07:37.652
Puts me in an odd mood.

07:37.686 --> 07:40.354
So you're rich,

07:40.388 --> 07:45.059
Darling, I can barely keep the lights on.

07:45.093 --> 07:47.061
<i>Why don't you sell up?</i>

07:47.095 --> 07:49.463
I bet you'd do all right.

07:49.498 --> 07:52.165
Did you come all the way over
to talk about real estate?

07:52.200 --> 07:53.934
Anybody else here?

07:53.968 --> 07:56.502
No.
Just me.

07:56.537 --> 08:00.273
Rattling through the halls like a ghost.

08:01.976 --> 08:03.810
How many rooms in this place?

08:03.844 --> 08:06.179
20.

08:06.214 --> 08:08.649
Get over here and we'll start in this one.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.492
Let's eat first.

08:16.526 --> 08:18.360
Shall we?

08:18.394 --> 08:20.295
Ain't hungry.

08:22.131 --> 08:24.700
You're going to need your strength.

08:40.116 --> 08:41.650
Are you sure we shouldn't help?

08:41.684 --> 08:43.419
Not unless she asks.

08:47.424 --> 08:48.790
Okay.

08:48.825 --> 08:51.026
I got you.

08:52.028 --> 08:54.997
- You're Willie.
- That's me.

08:59.135 --> 09:02.238
Well, now that we're all finally together,

09:02.272 --> 09:05.241
the rest of you say hello
to your aunt and uncle.

09:07.044 --> 09:09.613
Nora.
You're a big girl now.

09:09.647 --> 09:11.248
Thank you for coming, Uncle Nucky.

09:11.282 --> 09:14.151
This is my wife Margaret.

09:14.185 --> 09:15.819
How do you do, Auntie Margaret?

09:15.854 --> 09:17.488
A pleasure to meet you, Nora.

09:17.522 --> 09:19.757
- This is Teddy.
- Hi.

09:19.791 --> 09:22.059
- Patrick.
- Brian.

09:22.094 --> 09:24.162
- Brian.
- Brian.

09:24.196 --> 09:25.930
- Nice to meet you.
- Kathleen.

09:25.964 --> 09:28.633
- Hello.
- Dermott.

09:28.667 --> 09:31.135
Pleasure to meet you.

09:33.739 --> 09:37.142
Is this where your sister lives?

09:37.176 --> 09:39.310
I told you I had a sister?

09:39.345 --> 09:41.446
You don't remember anything.

09:41.480 --> 09:45.016
You have a sister and a daddy and a mommy

09:45.050 --> 09:46.951
and they live on a farm.

09:46.985 --> 09:48.853
In Wisconsin.

09:48.887 --> 09:50.588
Is that here?

09:50.622 --> 09:52.390
This is Michigan Avenue.

09:52.424 --> 09:54.425
Not the same thing.

10:00.165 --> 10:02.065
How do I look?

10:03.701 --> 10:06.536
You need to fix your glasses.

10:12.076 --> 10:14.678
Mr. Harrow.
Hello.

10:14.712 --> 10:16.513
Hello.

10:18.182 --> 10:21.352
- I'm here.
- Yes, you are.

10:21.386 --> 10:23.120
This must be Tommy.

10:23.154 --> 10:25.523
We walked the whole way.

10:29.527 --> 10:31.562
Here.

10:31.596 --> 10:34.832
Did you bring those for me?

10:40.972 --> 10:42.539
<i>Girls.</i>

10:42.574 --> 10:45.443
<i>Please come prep the table.</i>

10:45.477 --> 10:48.312
<i>Edith, grab the beef by the stove.</i>

10:48.347 --> 10:49.647
<i>Nora, cutlery.</i>

10:49.681 --> 10:51.415
All going smoothly?

10:51.450 --> 10:53.318
How's that?

10:53.352 --> 10:56.053
Shipments to New York.

10:58.223 --> 11:01.859
Is this the topic of conversation?

11:03.061 --> 11:04.428
Up to you.

11:04.463 --> 11:06.564
You're the one who's working
there, aren't you?

11:06.598 --> 11:08.499
Mickey doesn't tell me anything.

11:08.534 --> 11:09.901
And you'd like me to address that?

11:09.935 --> 11:12.436
- I'm not complaining.
- Eli.

11:12.471 --> 11:14.005
Can I get a drink?

11:14.039 --> 11:16.408
Right this second?

11:16.442 --> 11:18.810
Do I need an appointment?

11:18.845 --> 11:20.178
I promised June.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.914
<i>Not before sundown.</i>

11:21.948 --> 11:23.615
<i>Not in the house.</i>

11:23.649 --> 11:26.485
I got to tell you,
it keeps your head clear.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.153
Preaching temperance now?

11:28.188 --> 11:31.590
Look, Nucky, I'm glad you came.

11:34.093 --> 11:36.462
We don't have to talk about anything.

11:37.797 --> 11:41.400
All I want is for us
to have a nice dinner.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.402
<i>Can we do that?</i>

11:43.436 --> 11:46.171
<i>Bless us, O Lord, and...</i>

11:46.205 --> 11:48.473
<i>And these, Thy gifts.</i>

11:48.507 --> 11:53.245
And these, Thy gifts,
which we are about to receive.

11:53.279 --> 11:55.280
From Thy bount...

11:55.315 --> 11:57.182
From Thy bounty.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.917
From Thy bounty...

11:58.951 --> 12:02.587
...through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.389
Amen.

12:04.423 --> 12:06.658
- Make the sign.
- Let's eat.

12:06.692 --> 12:09.227
There's just something I'd like to say,

12:09.261 --> 12:11.629
if that's all right.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.533
We've been through some hard times.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.902
And I want Uncle Nucky to know

12:17.937 --> 12:21.506
we're grateful for
all that he's done for us.

12:21.540 --> 12:24.643
<i>We're grateful to have</i>
<i>him back at our table</i>

12:24.677 --> 12:27.012
<i>after so long.</i>

12:27.046 --> 12:30.048
We're grateful to meet Margaret at last,

12:30.083 --> 12:32.551
<i>who is so lovely,</i>

12:32.585 --> 12:34.052
and we welcome her

12:34.087 --> 12:37.623
and Teddy and Emily to our family.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.159
What I love about spring,

12:40.193 --> 12:43.595
how everything starts growing again

12:43.630 --> 12:47.032
when it's all been so gray.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.036
And for this to be the day

12:51.071 --> 12:53.872
that all of us...

12:53.907 --> 12:56.308
look at me now.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.917
Beautiful words.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.651
Eat your soup before it gets cold.

13:07.686 --> 13:09.820
<i>About time.</i>

13:11.456 --> 13:13.958
Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest.

13:13.992 --> 13:16.226
Let these gifts to us be blessed.

13:16.261 --> 13:19.162
Amen.

13:19.197 --> 13:22.031
- That's how you say grace?
- What's wrong with it?

13:22.066 --> 13:23.967
Nothing, if you're six years old.

13:24.001 --> 13:26.236
I'll bet you liked it.

13:26.270 --> 13:28.037
It was okay.

13:28.072 --> 13:31.474
- Tell me this, kid.
- Shoot.

13:31.509 --> 13:33.509
Who the hell are you
and why are you at my table?

13:33.510 --> 13:34.444
Dad.

13:34.479 --> 13:37.081
Mama's sick, so we came to eat here.

13:37.115 --> 13:39.149
Now, that's all straightened out.

13:39.184 --> 13:41.985
I told you, Dad,
Mr. Harrow takes care of him.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.954
Like Julia takes care of you, Paul.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.756
Only without the diaper changes.

13:45.791 --> 13:48.893
You know what? You can go right
back next door for all I care.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.562
Thank you.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.916
Of all the days on the calendar,
this one takes the cake.

13:52.917 --> 13:55.133
He dies, comes back to life,

13:55.167 --> 13:57.435
disappears for 2,000 years,
but don't worry.

13:57.469 --> 14:00.037
He'll turn up again.

14:00.072 --> 14:02.574
- Suckers.
- There's a child at the table.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.776
Am I shocking you?

14:05.945 --> 14:08.346
Put all this nonsense in their heads.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.415
Man in the sky, everlasting life.

14:10.449 --> 14:13.113
10 years later, we dump 'em
on some godforsaken shore

14:13.114 --> 14:15.754
with a rifle in their hands waiting
to get their heads blown off.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.123
- What good is Jesus then?
- Dad!

14:18.157 --> 14:19.825
Stop it.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.660
What good did he do you?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.262
You don't have to answer that.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.898
No, no, no. He's a man and
I asked him a question.

14:28.402 --> 14:31.471
Just because you
don't believe in something

14:31.505 --> 14:34.607
doesn't mean it isn't true.

14:36.677 --> 14:40.213
Well, you're shaping up
into a disappointment.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.248
Can we eat now, Your Lordship?

14:42.283 --> 14:44.283
Who's stopping you?

14:44.318 --> 14:45.751
Let's go, guys.

14:49.056 --> 14:52.526
Mr. Harrow, could you help me
with something in the kitchen?

15:01.970 --> 15:04.505
Put an apron on him.

15:12.380 --> 15:14.815
This is going well.

15:16.118 --> 15:17.852
I'm used to him.

15:17.886 --> 15:20.020
You only think you are.

15:20.055 --> 15:23.023
He's got a lot more in his kit bag,

15:23.058 --> 15:26.360
believe me.

15:26.394 --> 15:29.329
He's got you at least.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.364
What's a boxer without a sparring partner?

15:31.399 --> 15:34.834
- He hits you?
- What? No.

15:34.868 --> 15:36.869
I just...

15:36.904 --> 15:40.506
when you compare a thing to another thing.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.377
He likes you, though.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.812
Why do you say that?

15:45.846 --> 15:47.615
He wants to know what you think.

15:47.649 --> 15:50.284
<i>That's not usual.</i>

15:52.754 --> 15:55.155
I better get back in there

15:55.190 --> 15:57.392
with a chair and a whip.

15:59.862 --> 16:03.397
That's for you.

16:03.432 --> 16:05.966
<i>I figured you wouldn't</i>
<i>want to make a fuss.</i>

16:13.441 --> 16:15.609
Did I do the wrong thing?

16:15.643 --> 16:17.978
- Just tell me.
- No.

16:19.513 --> 16:21.915
It smells good.

16:21.949 --> 16:23.583
Thank you.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.155
I'll keep watch on the little one.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.657
Come out whenever you're ready.

16:57.985 --> 16:59.619
Keep us ever mindful

16:59.654 --> 17:01.788
of the needs of others.

17:01.822 --> 17:04.891
Amen.

17:04.925 --> 17:07.828
Just to cover the plus side first,

17:07.862 --> 17:11.564
we still got the stretch along
Canal over to West Street.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.634
The speaks on Laight and Hubert,

17:14.667 --> 17:17.136
cathouse on North Moore.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.771
The rest, I can say it,

17:19.807 --> 17:22.407
not say it, your choice.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.210
<i>We're ready.</i>

17:27.047 --> 17:29.949
We lost a lot of turf with
that Tabor Heights business.

17:29.984 --> 17:31.051
Just a fact.

17:31.085 --> 17:34.287
And right now, in terms of the manpower,

17:34.321 --> 17:35.788
we don't have it.

17:35.823 --> 17:38.057
We don't have it and they know it.

17:38.092 --> 17:40.327
If we were having that conversation.

17:45.766 --> 17:49.102
So this is thin.

17:50.071 --> 17:52.372
And that is why.

17:53.909 --> 17:55.142
<i>Giuseppe.</i>

17:55.177 --> 17:57.044
<i>Giuseppe, come out of there.</i>

17:57.079 --> 17:59.881
<i>It's getting cold.</i>
<i>Giuseppe!</i>

18:02.084 --> 18:04.285
Now, not my place,

18:04.320 --> 18:06.621
only conversation,

18:06.656 --> 18:09.991
but Joe the Boss that we respect

18:10.025 --> 18:11.860
and admire,

18:11.894 --> 18:15.763
he's not gonna care about
these circumstances of ours.

18:15.798 --> 18:18.466
So what I would ask, maybe,

18:18.500 --> 18:22.403
is how do you want to handle that?

18:22.437 --> 18:24.472
'Cause he's waiting.

18:26.274 --> 18:28.742
- What?!
- <i>Are you coming in or not?</i>

18:28.776 --> 18:31.096
- I'm in the middle of a meeting.
- <i>It's turning to mush.</i>

18:31.097 --> 18:32.213
So start without me.

18:32.247 --> 18:34.327
<i>And then you're the big baby</i>
<i>'cause we didn't wait.</i>

18:34.328 --> 18:36.050
<i>Come in and eat or don't come in at all.</i>

18:40.288 --> 18:42.523
Well?

19:00.742 --> 19:03.077
This is how you're dressing?

19:03.111 --> 19:05.591
- What's wrong with it?
- We're not good enough for the suit?

19:05.614 --> 19:07.815
It's not a house suit.
It's a business suit.

19:07.849 --> 19:11.052
- Important business.
- Like you know all about it.

19:15.424 --> 19:17.525
I love you.
I love you.

19:17.559 --> 19:19.293
I'll sit here naked.
How about that?

19:26.902 --> 19:30.038
- I'm gonna go now.
- I made all the extra.

19:30.073 --> 19:31.974
Very generous, but...

19:34.411 --> 19:36.579
Thank you, yes.

19:43.587 --> 19:44.920
Let's start.

19:44.955 --> 19:47.256
What are we, cats in an alley?

19:58.767 --> 20:01.135
- Amen.
- Amen.

20:01.169 --> 20:03.037
<i>Basta!</i>

20:09.711 --> 20:11.479
<i>Father, Son, Holy Ghost,</i>

20:11.513 --> 20:14.048
who eats the fastest gets the most.

20:14.083 --> 20:17.018
Did you think that up yourself?

20:17.053 --> 20:19.454
Just pick stuff up along the way.

20:19.488 --> 20:23.025
I imagine you've had
all sorts of escapades

20:23.059 --> 20:24.627
between Indiana and here.

20:24.661 --> 20:27.530
Heck, I've been all over.

20:28.732 --> 20:30.900
Worked a logging crew in the Bitterroots.

20:30.934 --> 20:34.370
Picked oranges right off
the tree in Redlands.

20:34.404 --> 20:38.373
Had a little go digging
silver in Zacatecas, Mexico.

20:38.408 --> 20:40.909
What about girls?

20:40.944 --> 20:42.878
They got 'em down there.

20:42.912 --> 20:44.780
Did you break their hearts?

20:44.814 --> 20:47.349
<i>I gave them a good adios.</i>

20:50.120 --> 20:51.954
Such an adventurer.

20:51.988 --> 20:55.591
It makes me feel so timid.

20:56.827 --> 20:59.562
What's keeping you here?

20:59.597 --> 21:01.631
Memories, I suppose.

21:01.666 --> 21:03.867
And dreams.

21:03.902 --> 21:06.704
That don't pay the bills, though, do it?

21:09.675 --> 21:11.242
How did you become so wise?

21:11.276 --> 21:14.145
Tell you what, you put this
mausoleum up on the block,

21:14.180 --> 21:17.049
we hit the road with the stash,
have us a fine old time.

21:17.083 --> 21:18.717
I thought you came here for work.

21:18.752 --> 21:20.686
Who wants to do that if you don't have to?

21:20.721 --> 21:23.756
You wouldn't be trying to take advantage

21:23.790 --> 21:27.293
of a lonely widow, would you?

21:32.265 --> 21:35.067
Hike up that dress.

21:49.482 --> 21:51.683
Spread your legs.

21:57.823 --> 21:59.791
My.

21:59.825 --> 22:02.760
Is there nothing I can do to stop you?

22:11.036 --> 22:12.503
All right, kids, listen up.

22:12.537 --> 22:15.573
For those of you that are new
to this, these are the rules.

22:15.607 --> 22:18.242
No fighting.
No arguing.

22:18.277 --> 22:20.645
Whoever finds the most eggs wins 10 cents.

22:20.679 --> 22:22.981
But whoever finds a red egg

22:23.015 --> 22:25.484
wins a quarter.

22:25.518 --> 22:28.754
Okay, one,

22:28.788 --> 22:32.592
two...
did I say three?

22:32.626 --> 22:35.194
- No.
- Well, I'm saying it now.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.897
Three.

22:43.870 --> 22:46.105
You point and I'll look.

22:46.140 --> 22:48.274
I'll do it, Uncle Nucky.

22:49.676 --> 22:52.144
He hides 'em in the same place every year.

22:55.782 --> 22:58.650
What I always think about with this?

22:59.819 --> 23:04.089
Ma putting out three red eggs.

23:04.123 --> 23:06.124
I remember Dad keeping the money.

23:06.159 --> 23:07.859
Psst.

23:11.397 --> 23:13.298
Still up for that drink?

23:13.332 --> 23:15.566
Why not?

23:19.871 --> 23:23.607
Willie, you're the man in charge.

23:23.642 --> 23:25.275
You make it seem easy.

23:25.310 --> 23:26.877
<i>How do you mean?</i>

23:26.912 --> 23:29.346
Managing a brood of eight.

23:30.849 --> 23:33.951
There are moments I just want
to lie down and shut the door.

23:33.985 --> 23:37.855
But then there are days like this.

23:37.889 --> 23:40.458
And I think this is how
life is supposed to be.

23:40.492 --> 23:43.228
Your two seem awfully nice.

23:43.262 --> 23:45.664
They're eager to make a good impression.

23:45.698 --> 23:47.399
But thank you.

23:47.434 --> 23:50.269
Well, they've all got a bit
of devil in them, don't they?

23:50.303 --> 23:53.373
Willie ran me ragged for the longest time,

23:53.407 --> 23:55.141
if you want to know the truth.

23:55.175 --> 23:57.744
He's quite the young gentleman now.

23:57.778 --> 24:00.714
There was a lot of growing up
the last couple of years.

24:04.084 --> 24:05.485
I'm sorry, June,

24:05.519 --> 24:08.054
for all that's happened.

24:08.089 --> 24:09.823
It's not your fault.

24:09.857 --> 24:12.492
And Nucky did everything
he could to help us out.

24:13.727 --> 24:16.896
Yes, of course he did.

24:18.532 --> 24:20.033
I didn't think you'd come.

24:21.636 --> 24:23.437
Eli said I shouldn't bother.

24:23.471 --> 24:26.306
But you're
my sister-in-law.

24:26.341 --> 24:28.809
And we've never even met.

24:30.312 --> 24:33.113
- It's just that...
- You don't have to explain.

24:33.147 --> 24:36.784
Eli and Nucky, you know,

24:36.818 --> 24:39.553
they've had a lot of ups and downs.

24:40.656 --> 24:42.557
But Eli worships him.

24:43.959 --> 24:46.594
- He does?
- You know what that house was like.

24:46.629 --> 24:49.297
Ethan was a difficult man.

24:49.331 --> 24:52.200
And their mother, you never met her.

24:52.234 --> 24:55.436
Elenore was the sweetest woman.

24:55.471 --> 24:57.339
But like a wisp.

24:57.373 --> 24:59.407
A breeze might blow her away.

24:59.442 --> 25:02.043
<i>Nucky held them together.</i>

25:02.077 --> 25:05.246
He doesn't discuss such things with me.

25:05.281 --> 25:08.316
That's how he is.
All on the inside.

25:08.350 --> 25:11.085
But he has a good heart.

25:19.461 --> 25:21.662
Are you all right?

25:24.066 --> 25:26.266
He has a mistress.

25:26.301 --> 25:29.102
- Pardon?
- <i>An actress in New York.</i>

25:29.137 --> 25:31.971
He's there half the week.

25:32.006 --> 25:34.640
We hardly talk.

25:36.243 --> 25:39.044
He's involved in doings

25:39.079 --> 25:41.147
I can't bear to think about.

25:42.282 --> 25:45.418
He blames me.
I blame him.

25:47.121 --> 25:49.422
And I feel like

25:49.456 --> 25:52.291
the life is being pressed out of me.

25:56.697 --> 25:58.998
Well...

26:00.434 --> 26:02.535
I...

26:06.908 --> 26:09.676
You brought pineapple
upside-down.

26:12.813 --> 26:14.848
Yes.

26:14.882 --> 26:17.651
I hope everyone likes it.

26:19.921 --> 26:22.689
Let me find another cake dish.

26:32.367 --> 26:34.468
<i>Red egg!</i>

26:34.502 --> 26:36.570
<i>Red egg! Red egg!</i>

26:36.605 --> 26:38.039
I'll tell you what they are.

26:38.073 --> 26:39.873
Hayseed crooks with
their hands in the till.

26:39.875 --> 26:41.342
It started with Forbes.

26:41.377 --> 26:43.244
If there's any justice, which there isn't,

26:43.266 --> 26:45.146
they'll put the whole
cabinet in the hoosegow.

26:49.518 --> 26:51.486
Look who came back from the dead.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.588
What did I miss?

26:53.622 --> 26:56.158
Where to begin?

26:56.192 --> 26:58.827
- Who'd you vote for, Paul?
- Eugene V. Debs.

26:58.862 --> 27:00.429
You voted for a Bolshevik?

27:00.463 --> 27:03.733
- Debs is a socialist.
- What's the difference?

27:03.767 --> 27:05.687
What's the difference
between you and a baboon?

27:11.109 --> 27:13.644
I have to go sis.

27:13.678 --> 27:16.680
How is that my problem?

27:16.715 --> 27:18.482
You could tell him where the bathroom is.

27:18.517 --> 27:19.917
Is he housebroken?

27:19.952 --> 27:22.153
Pretty much.

27:22.187 --> 27:24.855
Upstairs, second door on the left.

27:25.758 --> 27:27.492
Come here.

27:27.526 --> 27:29.686
Make sure you aim that pistol
straight into the bowl.

27:29.687 --> 27:31.329
- You got me? Okay.
- Yeah.

28:53.079 --> 28:55.180
Go to church this morning?

28:55.214 --> 28:56.948
I had to.

28:56.983 --> 28:58.717
I'm a knight now.

28:58.751 --> 29:01.353
How you manage that?

29:01.387 --> 29:04.589
It helps to lose an awful lot of money.

29:06.459 --> 29:08.393
They don't make you confess or anything?

29:09.862 --> 29:12.664
That's for the people in steerage.

29:27.948 --> 29:30.650
I did 16 months.

29:30.684 --> 29:33.019
Handed in the badge.

29:33.053 --> 29:36.322
Missed my kids growing up.

29:36.356 --> 29:37.990
Haven't I taken my licks?

29:38.024 --> 29:41.026
You're back home.
You have a job.

29:41.061 --> 29:44.563
Under the circumstances, I say
you've made out pretty well.

29:44.598 --> 29:46.599
I can't survive this way.

29:46.633 --> 29:48.668
Loading trucks

29:48.735 --> 29:52.338
and riding shotgun for 30 bucks a day?

29:52.372 --> 29:53.606
Taking shit from Doyle?

29:53.640 --> 29:57.643
That's what this is about,

29:59.112 --> 30:00.546
Your wife begs me to come,

30:00.581 --> 30:03.349
your children smile and curtsey,

30:03.384 --> 30:05.385
and you and I wind up out here.

30:05.419 --> 30:06.779
You're the one who wanted a drink.

30:06.780 --> 30:09.122
And you're the one who wasn't drinking.

30:10.057 --> 30:12.292
Do you have to, Nucky?

30:12.326 --> 30:14.794
Do you really have to?

30:14.829 --> 30:18.498
You think I'm bottomless, don't you?

30:18.533 --> 30:21.234
Just keep reaching in there.

30:21.268 --> 30:23.536
And no matter what you do, it's all right.

30:23.571 --> 30:26.439
No matter what.

30:26.474 --> 30:30.176
<i>You sit down with my enemies.</i>

30:30.211 --> 30:32.945
You make choices you can't ever take back.

30:32.980 --> 30:35.581
And still...

30:35.616 --> 30:39.519
still you call yourself my brother.

30:40.787 --> 30:44.323
Don't you know how that hurts me?

30:57.603 --> 30:59.603
You must be kidding.

31:02.607 --> 31:05.042
Take it.
Go on.

31:06.644 --> 31:08.144
Pick it up.

31:08.179 --> 31:11.481
Put a bullet in me.

31:11.516 --> 31:13.116
Get it over with.

31:13.151 --> 31:17.021
'Cause I know you will sooner or later.

31:17.055 --> 31:20.157
And I'm sick of waiting for it.

31:38.241 --> 31:41.243
Why does it always need to be
such a melodrama with you?

31:43.513 --> 31:45.948
- So what was he like?
- Who?

31:47.184 --> 31:50.319
The guy you got hitched to for all this.

31:50.354 --> 31:53.222
I'd rather not talk about
it, if you don't mind.

31:53.257 --> 31:56.693
Sorry.
I just figured...

31:56.727 --> 31:58.761
That I did it for the money?

31:58.795 --> 32:01.697
That's none of my business.

32:06.403 --> 32:09.439
We knew each other since we were children.

32:11.475 --> 32:15.211
Though I was older than he.

32:16.847 --> 32:19.882
That's a difficult situation for a woman.

32:19.917 --> 32:22.886
<i>But somehow we put that aside.</i>

32:22.920 --> 32:26.423
For a little while, at least.

32:26.457 --> 32:29.092
What happened to him?

32:29.126 --> 32:31.694
He walked out one night

32:31.729 --> 32:34.431
and I never saw him again.

32:36.033 --> 32:40.536
So you don't really know
if he's dead or not.

32:43.707 --> 32:45.541
Where will we go?

32:45.576 --> 32:47.811
You and me?

32:49.513 --> 32:51.480
Anywheres.

32:51.515 --> 32:52.949
Ever been to Cuba?

32:52.983 --> 32:55.785
I've never been south of Cape May.

32:55.819 --> 32:58.421
Well, we steam on down there,

32:58.455 --> 33:01.824
order us a big pitcher of rum punch

33:01.859 --> 33:04.427
and just see where it takes us.

33:04.461 --> 33:06.896
- Just like that?
- Why not?

33:09.900 --> 33:12.368
We'd be free, wouldn't we?

33:14.171 --> 33:16.972
What else we kicking
around this old world for?

33:24.714 --> 33:26.482
Don't you want to do it again?

33:26.516 --> 33:28.117
Very much.

33:28.151 --> 33:30.786
But there's something
I wish we could do first.

33:30.820 --> 33:33.188
What?

33:34.357 --> 33:35.891
Take a bath.

33:35.926 --> 33:38.160
Right now?

33:38.195 --> 33:39.995
What for?

33:40.030 --> 33:43.065
I'm feeling just the tiniest bit greasy.

33:47.604 --> 33:49.471
<i>I'm going to send you in there.</i>

33:49.505 --> 33:51.707
You can dig a hole.

33:51.741 --> 33:55.110
- While you're in the hole...
- What are you doing?

33:55.144 --> 33:57.913
The cowboys are fighting the Germans.

33:59.582 --> 34:02.117
Dad?

34:03.603 --> 34:05.963
This little shit is sneaking
around where he don't belong.

34:05.982 --> 34:08.101
- Dad, let go of him.
- He's breaking into his room.

34:08.103 --> 34:10.143
- So what?
- Putting his paws all over his things.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.460
He's a kid, Dad, and Freddie's
things don't matter.

34:12.495 --> 34:14.129
They matter to me.
He's my son.

34:14.164 --> 34:17.331
They matter to me. They matter
more than this freak you invited.

34:17.367 --> 34:19.333
Mr. Harrow is a guest
in our house.

34:19.369 --> 34:20.803
They matter more than you.

34:22.739 --> 34:26.275
You're drunk and you don't
know what you're saying.

34:26.309 --> 34:27.810
How the fuck would you know?

34:30.647 --> 34:33.549
Paul, let go of him right now.

34:33.583 --> 34:36.786
- Or what?
- Or I'll kill you.

34:39.523 --> 34:41.190
Get out of my house.

34:43.328 --> 34:46.364
<i>You're all a bunch of goddamn strangers.</i>

34:46.398 --> 34:48.632
Every one of you.

35:03.549 --> 35:05.550
Take some food at least.

35:05.584 --> 35:07.352
We ate plenty, miss.

35:07.386 --> 35:09.187
Thanks just the same.

35:09.221 --> 35:10.755
- Mr. Corbett...
- Not a word.

35:10.789 --> 35:13.157
I've been down in that same bottle.
Believe me.

35:13.192 --> 35:14.759
How did you climb out?

35:14.793 --> 35:16.394
That's a talk for another day.

35:16.428 --> 35:18.963
If you need anything, you
make sure you knock, okay?

35:26.506 --> 35:29.842
Give him this.
Dad won't know the difference.

35:29.876 --> 35:33.012
- We're leaving.
- I'm only trying to explain...

35:33.046 --> 35:36.983
- We're all leaving.
- You mean me?

35:37.018 --> 35:39.319
- I should go with...
- I wasn't...

35:39.353 --> 35:42.655
- You're asking...
- Yes.

35:42.689 --> 35:45.524
You should get your coat

35:45.558 --> 35:48.994
and you should come with me.

35:53.732 --> 35:55.333
Okay.

36:21.827 --> 36:24.162
Who's next?

36:25.130 --> 36:27.632
Eli?
Do your pirate.

36:27.666 --> 36:28.700
Gonna sit it out.

36:28.734 --> 36:31.770
Someone has to keep the tradition up.

36:31.804 --> 36:33.371
- Uncle Nucky?
- Uncle Nucky.

36:33.406 --> 36:35.640
- <i>We want Uncle Nucky.</i>
- <i>Yeah, we want Uncle Nucky.</i>

36:35.675 --> 36:37.442
No. No, no, no.

36:37.477 --> 36:40.879
We want Uncle Nucky.
We want Uncle Nucky.

36:40.913 --> 36:43.515
We want Uncle Nucky.
We want Uncle Nucky.

36:43.549 --> 36:44.983
We want Uncle Nucky.

36:45.018 --> 36:47.219
As you all know, it's been many years

36:47.253 --> 36:49.922
since I've toured the act
and I may be a little rusty.

36:49.956 --> 36:51.623
- Let's see it!
- Stop stalling!

36:51.658 --> 36:54.326
Show some leg.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.796
You're a rough crowd.

36:56.830 --> 36:58.664
All right.

36:58.698 --> 37:01.634
- Where are you from, sir?
- Your house.

37:01.668 --> 37:03.136
I thought you looked familiar.

37:03.170 --> 37:05.671
- Yeah.
- May I borrow these?

37:05.706 --> 37:07.173
Or should I just lay my own?

37:07.207 --> 37:08.708
You can borrow them.

37:08.742 --> 37:11.711
Much less painful. Okay.

37:16.417 --> 37:20.320
There's this one fella,
Theodore by name, I believe,

37:20.355 --> 37:22.789
was strolling along the boardwalk one day

37:22.824 --> 37:25.592
taking it over easy...

37:25.627 --> 37:27.528
when who should he see,

37:27.562 --> 37:29.663
coming off the steeplechase,

37:29.697 --> 37:33.000
but his old pal Patrick.

37:33.034 --> 37:34.635
- Brian.
- <i>"Pat," says he,</i>

37:34.669 --> 37:36.437
"how are you
this fine day?"

37:36.471 --> 37:38.405
And Pat says, "Well, since you asked,

37:38.439 --> 37:41.441
I'm feeling sunny-side up."

37:41.476 --> 37:43.477
And they stroll a little bit further.

37:43.511 --> 37:46.947
They do a bit of this, a bit of that.

37:46.981 --> 37:50.150
When who should they run
smack into but old Officer...

37:50.184 --> 37:52.519
- Eli.
- Old Officer Eli.

37:52.553 --> 37:56.190
<i>"What are you rascals up to?"</i>

37:56.224 --> 37:58.392
Theodore looks at Patrick,

37:58.426 --> 38:00.761
and Patrick looks at Theodore.

38:00.795 --> 38:03.063
<i>And they both say,</i>

38:03.098 --> 38:05.966
"We better scramble."

38:13.475 --> 38:15.943
- Who's next?
- That's great.

38:15.977 --> 38:17.911
Margaret?

38:17.945 --> 38:20.980
I wouldn't dare follow that.

38:21.015 --> 38:23.650
I'd like to see what's up your sleeve.

38:23.684 --> 38:25.385
You would, would you?

38:25.419 --> 38:28.688
- <i>Yeah, come on, please?</i>
- <i>Aunt Margaret.</i>

38:30.991 --> 38:32.358
Aunt Margaret.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.562
- <i>Yay!</i>
<i>- Goodie.</i>

38:37.264 --> 38:39.532
Well, now...

38:39.567 --> 38:42.035
this is just a bit of nonsense, really,

38:42.069 --> 38:44.437
but all right.

38:44.472 --> 38:47.908
♪ Tell me ma when I go home ♪

38:47.942 --> 38:50.143

<i>♪ Tell me ma when I go home,</i>

39:07.295 --> 39:09.664
Tommy, hey.
Stay close.

39:09.698 --> 39:12.767
Why did I think today
would be a good idea?

39:12.801 --> 39:15.069
Didn't really turn out very well.

39:16.672 --> 39:19.941
You're supposed to say something
comforting when people are upset.

39:19.975 --> 39:21.509
In that case,

39:21.543 --> 39:23.911
I had a wonderful time.

39:23.946 --> 39:27.115
Are you teasing me?

39:27.149 --> 39:28.983
You aren't.

39:30.352 --> 39:32.653
You are.

39:32.688 --> 39:34.489
What difference does it make?

39:34.523 --> 39:37.191
Do you really think
there's a crocodile boy?

39:37.226 --> 39:39.194
<i>For a nickel, we can find out.</i>

39:39.228 --> 39:41.096
No, thank you.

39:41.130 --> 39:43.065
Not that I couldn't look at a...

39:43.099 --> 39:45.567
Jesus Christ.
Pardon my French,

39:45.602 --> 39:48.337
but it's hard to know what to say to you.

39:48.372 --> 39:51.074
Say anything you want.

39:51.108 --> 39:53.410
Anything?
All right.

39:53.444 --> 39:55.479
Don't threaten to kill my father.

39:55.513 --> 39:58.548
He's a mean drunk and a horse's ass,

39:58.583 --> 40:01.051
but I don't like it.

40:01.085 --> 40:03.120
I was just trying to sound tough.

40:03.154 --> 40:06.523
I've had plenty of that and I'm
sure not looking for more.

40:06.557 --> 40:08.492
What are you looking for?

40:08.526 --> 40:11.194
I don't know.

40:11.229 --> 40:13.564
A raise.

40:13.598 --> 40:16.366
Should he be that close to the camel?

40:16.401 --> 40:18.635
Hey, Tommy.
Tommy.

40:20.138 --> 40:22.105
- They bite.
- I don't care.

40:22.140 --> 40:24.207
- Well, I do.
<i>- Hey.</i>

40:24.241 --> 40:26.676
Are you gonna sulk all night
because my father's a dope?

40:26.711 --> 40:30.213
- No.
- Okay, then.

40:34.652 --> 40:37.053
I think he needs to go home.

40:37.088 --> 40:40.757
And honestly, so do I.

40:40.792 --> 40:42.659
I,

40:46.264 --> 40:48.031
Miss Sagorsky...

40:48.065 --> 40:50.099
My name is Julia.

40:50.133 --> 40:51.600
I'm Richard.

40:51.635 --> 40:53.969
Well...

40:54.004 --> 40:56.739
how the hell do you do?

40:58.374 --> 41:00.576
Folks, 50 cents, five minutes,

41:00.610 --> 41:02.311
happy Easter memories,

41:02.345 --> 41:06.549
World's Playground year of our Lord 1923.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.817
Sonny, up here.
Mommy over there.

41:08.852 --> 41:11.987
Daddy over there. And what
do you have when it's all gone?

41:12.022 --> 41:13.389
Nothing without a picture.

41:13.423 --> 41:15.257
And...

41:15.292 --> 41:17.860
Parcheesi.

41:17.894 --> 41:20.563
Beautiful. Beautiful.

41:22.766 --> 41:25.769
I just need to get this said.

41:25.803 --> 41:28.305
With all due respect,

41:28.340 --> 41:31.642
You've put me down in this game.

41:31.677 --> 41:34.612
I didn't ask for that.

41:34.647 --> 41:36.982
Not even a handshake.

41:37.016 --> 41:39.751
Make me want things,

41:39.786 --> 41:42.554
things I can see,

41:42.589 --> 41:45.257
that I can almost touch.

41:45.291 --> 41:48.894
Then You take them away.

41:48.928 --> 41:51.564
Not for me, right?

41:51.598 --> 41:55.301
Everyone else, but not me.

41:55.335 --> 41:57.003
I'm what?

41:57.037 --> 41:59.672
A mistake You made?

41:59.706 --> 42:02.475
Like some leftovers?

42:03.611 --> 42:06.780
And I'm supposed to go through my life,

42:06.814 --> 42:09.149
no friendship,

42:09.183 --> 42:12.185
no love till I'm pissing in my bed,

42:12.219 --> 42:14.654
coughing up blood on the sheets.

42:14.688 --> 42:16.323
Then I'll know, right?

42:16.357 --> 42:18.959
Then it'll all be clear.

42:18.993 --> 42:20.861
Put it front of me, take it away.

42:20.895 --> 42:23.663
Why would You do that?

42:24.799 --> 42:26.332
Just to screw with me?

42:26.367 --> 42:29.402
What kind of sick fuck thinks that way?

42:31.238 --> 42:35.308
I'm supposed to trust You.

42:35.342 --> 42:37.343
Based on the treatment so far,

42:37.377 --> 42:39.778
what are You up to,

42:39.813 --> 42:42.147
I'm here.

42:42.181 --> 42:44.216
I'm listening!

42:44.250 --> 42:47.286
I'm ready for any kind of explanation!

42:52.958 --> 42:54.826
<i>Are you all right?</i>

43:01.066 --> 43:03.067
I'm praying.

43:03.101 --> 43:05.702
You're yelling.

43:09.174 --> 43:11.008
Can I ask you something?

43:11.042 --> 43:13.176
Of course.

43:22.754 --> 43:25.256
Where's God keep the rest of it?

43:26.792 --> 43:29.327
Answer me!

43:29.361 --> 43:32.063
Get the money!

43:34.366 --> 43:37.535
Prepare to be enchanted.

43:52.349 --> 43:54.217
Do you like it?

43:56.620 --> 43:59.255
Beats a 10-cent bathhouse
by a country mile.

44:00.790 --> 44:02.891
We're going to have a wonderful time here.

44:02.926 --> 44:05.361
But you have to indulge me

44:05.395 --> 44:08.164
and do exactly as I say.

44:12.536 --> 44:14.971
First you need to undress.

44:26.518 --> 44:28.586
What am I supposed to do next?

44:31.223 --> 44:34.158
- What about you?
- You first.

44:36.728 --> 44:39.329
Careful.
It's very warm.

44:41.833 --> 44:43.500
<i>Slowly.</i>

44:43.535 --> 44:45.970
Slowly.

44:47.506 --> 44:49.708
There you go.

44:52.878 --> 44:56.081
- Well?
- A little lonely.

45:04.824 --> 45:06.058
Better?

45:06.093 --> 45:08.528
Getting there.

45:09.930 --> 45:12.866
I'm going to wash you now.

45:12.900 --> 45:16.135
And you don't have to do a thing.

45:26.280 --> 45:28.347
What happened here?

45:30.884 --> 45:32.652
A little dust-up.

45:32.686 --> 45:34.754
Don't tell me.

45:34.788 --> 45:36.489
A girl?

45:36.523 --> 45:38.724
Somebody was treating her
a way I don't like.

45:38.759 --> 45:41.160
And you rode to the rescue.

45:41.194 --> 45:43.062
I don't know about that,

45:43.096 --> 45:46.665
but someone had to do something.

45:48.501 --> 45:51.636
Is it nice?

45:54.206 --> 45:56.974
Then close your eyes and relax.

45:57.008 --> 46:00.410
I'm going to make you feel very good.

46:10.688 --> 46:13.323
You really are rather a
decent person, aren't you?

46:13.357 --> 46:15.625
<i>I'm just trying to get along.</i>

46:15.659 --> 46:19.362
But it ain't been the easiest life.

46:23.500 --> 46:26.536
Well, it's going to be easier now.

46:46.123 --> 46:47.657
Fucking hell!

46:47.692 --> 46:50.928
- What did you just do?
- Don't concern yourself.

46:52.798 --> 46:55.433
- What is this?
- Something special for you.

46:55.467 --> 46:57.107
What the goddamn you trying to pull here?

46:57.108 --> 46:58.436
It's just heroin.
That's all.

46:58.471 --> 47:00.372
- Lovely heroin.
- How much was in this?

47:00.406 --> 47:02.474
I suppose rather a lot.

47:02.508 --> 47:04.876
How about I put this in you,

47:04.911 --> 47:06.645
How about I stick this...

47:06.679 --> 47:08.847
stick this...

47:10.549 --> 47:13.318
I'm getting up.
I'm getting up.

47:13.352 --> 47:15.053
You shouldn't fight it.

47:15.087 --> 47:17.322
Enjoy it.

47:17.356 --> 47:19.857
Have a new adventure.

47:28.800 --> 47:31.636
Am I talking?

47:31.670 --> 47:33.337
No, darling.

47:33.372 --> 47:36.007
You're dreaming.

49:12.802 --> 49:14.036
You know how it is, Joe.

49:14.070 --> 49:15.771
I had the whole thing with the family.

49:29.453 --> 49:32.321
- It won't happen again.
- You think I'm blind,

49:32.356 --> 49:33.556
I'm deaf?

49:33.590 --> 49:36.259
You make a war in New Jersey,

49:36.293 --> 49:38.061
bodies on the road,

49:38.095 --> 49:41.298
but you can't hold onto 20
blocks here where you belong?

49:41.332 --> 49:42.852
I'm gonna turn the whole thing around.

49:42.853 --> 49:44.568
No more problems.
You'll see.

49:49.775 --> 49:51.910
I'm your guy, Joe.

49:51.977 --> 49:54.846
Whatever else happens,
I ain't never forget...

50:05.892 --> 50:07.626
It's Easter Sunday, Joe.

50:07.660 --> 50:09.027
Also April Fools'.

50:09.061 --> 50:10.595
Then what are we joking about?

50:13.465 --> 50:15.766
I'm not joking.

50:22.373 --> 50:25.309
Nucky Thompson, Arnold Rothstein.

50:26.579 --> 50:28.679
What about them?

50:28.714 --> 50:31.349
They're not losing sleep over
no 20 blocks on the Westside.

50:31.383 --> 50:33.384
They're working together.

50:33.418 --> 50:36.287
They're building something
a lot bigger than you and me.

50:36.322 --> 50:37.456
Let them do what they want.

50:37.490 --> 50:39.410
Because you think you got
what you have, right?

50:39.411 --> 50:42.961
But not for long.
Things are changing.

50:42.996 --> 50:44.596
The Luciano kid...

50:44.631 --> 50:47.700
I straighten him out.
You don't worry.

50:47.734 --> 50:52.071
He's not like you and me!
Look who he works for, Joe.

50:52.105 --> 50:56.609
<i>They're building something</i>
<i>and it don't include us.</i>

50:56.643 --> 50:59.845
Who's gonna own this business,

50:59.879 --> 51:02.081
Heebs and Micks

51:02.115 --> 51:05.284
and backstabbing fucks that don't
respect where they come from.

51:05.318 --> 51:07.987
<i>After all the blood we put into it?</i>

51:14.327 --> 51:16.229
<i>You do what you got to do with me,</i>

51:16.263 --> 51:18.164
but you're gonna be in a war

51:18.198 --> 51:20.633
whether you like it or not.

51:20.668 --> 51:24.570
You gonna save me,

51:24.605 --> 51:26.238
Give me your blessing.

51:26.273 --> 51:27.840
<i>Let me finish what I started,</i>

51:27.874 --> 51:30.009
<i>but with enough juice</i>
<i>this time to make it stick.</i>

51:30.110 --> 51:32.411
- I'll bring you Thompson.
- And what do I care about...

51:32.445 --> 51:34.680
And I'll bring you Rothstein.

51:34.714 --> 51:36.815
Luciano and the kikes he runs with.

51:36.850 --> 51:38.417
I'll kill 'em all.

51:39.685 --> 51:42.020
<i>And when I do,</i>

51:42.054 --> 51:44.555
they're not gonna call
you Joe the Boss no more.

51:44.590 --> 51:47.258
They're gonna call you

51:47.292 --> 51:49.460
Joe the King.

52:00.240 --> 52:02.308
Go get two coffees.

52:14.987 --> 52:17.022
All right?

52:17.056 --> 52:18.957
Asleep like a shot.

52:20.993 --> 52:23.762
They seemed to enjoy themselves.

52:23.796 --> 52:26.465
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

52:26.499 --> 52:28.967
I don't know. Yes.

52:29.002 --> 52:32.471
Something for them outside of this house.

52:37.144 --> 52:39.479
June's very sweet.

52:41.549 --> 52:43.416
Eli was 20.

52:43.450 --> 52:45.418
She was 17.

52:45.453 --> 52:47.988
He's never looked at anyone else.

52:48.022 --> 52:51.424
<i>Not that he hasn't kept her busy.</i>

52:51.459 --> 52:53.026
She's grateful to you.

52:53.060 --> 52:55.762
<i>For all you've done for them.</i>

52:55.796 --> 52:59.766
Well, maybe I could do more.

53:02.036 --> 53:03.803
And you juggle.

53:06.072 --> 53:08.974
I hadn't done it in years.

53:09.008 --> 53:12.010
Picked it up as a kid
hanging around the midway.

53:13.746 --> 53:15.780
You can juggle.

53:15.815 --> 53:17.783
You can be charming and funny.

53:17.817 --> 53:21.186
- <i>Generous.</i>
- Say the same about you.

53:22.521 --> 53:24.923
I can't juggle.

53:24.957 --> 53:27.726
I'll teach you right now.

53:30.563 --> 53:32.564
It's too late.

53:34.066 --> 53:36.667
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

53:36.702 --> 53:38.802
but it's just too late.

53:59.859 --> 54:02.160
Hey.

54:02.195 --> 54:03.662
Yes.

54:03.696 --> 54:05.931
Just taking a minute.

54:05.965 --> 54:08.701
No, come on.

54:08.735 --> 54:11.804
That's enough for tonight.
Go to bed.

54:13.674 --> 54:16.643
It was all right, wasn't it?

54:16.677 --> 54:18.779
The way it used to be.

54:20.015 --> 54:22.349
You did a great job.

54:22.384 --> 54:24.684
They love to see him.

54:25.953 --> 54:28.321
And she...

54:28.355 --> 54:31.124
I liked her.

54:31.159 --> 54:33.293
I liked her,

54:33.327 --> 54:36.062
but she's not happy.

54:36.097 --> 54:38.798
Hon,

54:38.832 --> 54:41.467
that's their problem.

54:46.239 --> 54:48.640
I got it.

54:52.612 --> 54:54.646
Bed.

54:58.017 --> 55:00.218
- Hello?
- It's me.

55:00.286 --> 55:02.755
Something up?

55:02.789 --> 55:04.557
<i>That mess in Tabor.</i>

55:04.591 --> 55:06.592
I should have said

55:06.626 --> 55:08.561
you were the only smart one in the bunch.

55:08.595 --> 55:11.163
<i>Well, I wasn't able to stop it.</i>

55:11.198 --> 55:13.432
But you put yourself on the line.

55:13.467 --> 55:14.934
It didn't go unnoticed.

55:14.968 --> 55:17.870
<i>I'll be making a change.</i>

55:17.905 --> 55:20.306
<i>You're running the warehouse with Mickey</i>

55:20.340 --> 55:22.942
<i>starting tomorrow.</i>

55:22.977 --> 55:25.245
Okay?

55:25.279 --> 55:27.947
Yeah.

55:27.981 --> 55:30.550
I...

55:32.552 --> 55:34.320
thank you.

55:34.354 --> 55:36.355
All right.

55:37.658 --> 55:40.793
Eli, the whole family had a good time.

56:18.397 --> 56:20.632
Come in.

56:23.870 --> 56:25.671
Am I interrupting?

56:25.705 --> 56:27.873
No.

56:27.907 --> 56:30.676
How was your afternoon?

56:30.710 --> 56:33.946
There were ups and downs,

56:33.980 --> 56:37.483
but in the end it turned out nice.

56:42.455 --> 56:44.690
The girls are back.

56:50.864 --> 56:53.066
Tommy behaved?

56:53.100 --> 56:55.835
Yes.

56:55.869 --> 56:59.005
No untoward vulgarity?

57:00.641 --> 57:03.109
No, not very much.

57:10.986 --> 57:14.188
Are you feeling better?

57:22.165 --> 57:24.733
My son is dead.

57:34.010 --> 57:36.746
And nothing on earth

57:36.780 --> 57:40.116
will ever bring him back.

57:51.929 --> 57:53.196
<i>Get Mr. Harrow.</i>

57:53.230 --> 57:55.365
<i>Go get him.</i>
<i>Get Mr. Harrow.</i>

57:55.399 --> 57:57.767
<i>Get him now.</i>

58:06.743 --> 58:09.044
<i>- What's happened?</i>
<i>- What do we do?</i>
