One-two-three-four ♪</i>

00:33.511 --> 00:35.818
Yeah, perfect!
All right family,

00:35.861 --> 00:38.777
who's ready for a round
of Cricket Darts?

00:38.821 --> 00:40.475
How is this different
from regular darts?

00:40.518 --> 00:41.606
Simple!

00:41.650 --> 00:42.999
Normally you get more points

00:43.043 --> 00:44.542
the closer your dart
gets to the middle.

00:44.566 --> 00:45.741
But in Cricket Darts,

00:45.784 --> 00:47.438
all the highest points
are on the edge!

00:47.482 --> 00:50.354
That way everyone's
guaranteed a high score!

00:50.398 --> 00:52.791
Doesn't that take away
any of the skill required,

00:52.835 --> 00:54.445
and thus, the point of the game?

00:54.489 --> 00:56.317
Naw, everyone loves
being a big winner!

00:56.360 --> 00:57.360
Here, I'll show ya!

00:59.798 --> 01:00.930
A perfect bullseye?!

01:00.973 --> 01:02.845
That means nothing
in Cricket Darts.

01:02.888 --> 01:05.500
Now what is going on out there?

01:06.153 --> 01:07.197
Well, I'll be.

01:07.545 --> 01:08.653
Looks like they're finally
doing something

01:08.677 --> 01:10.244
with the old Big Coffee space!

01:10.287 --> 01:11.680
Huh. Wonder what it's gonna be.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.986
Last thing that opened there
was Wholesome Foods!

01:14.030 --> 01:16.293
I'm not gonna even bother
getting my hopes up.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.469
Ah!

01:19.035 --> 01:20.341
Ah!

01:20.384 --> 01:21.951
Oh, hey! Isn't that
that burger chain

01:21.994 --> 01:23.518
-you like so much, Cricket?
They're up!

01:23.561 --> 01:25.346
Cricket's hopes are up!

01:25.389 --> 01:26.608
What's out there, Cricket?

01:29.176 --> 01:30.351
Uh, brother?

01:30.612 --> 01:33.136
Careful, sweetie!
He's speaking in tongues...

01:33.180 --> 01:35.573
Burger Clown! Go to...

01:35.617 --> 01:36.792
Go to now!

01:36.835 --> 01:38.707
Oh, good! I like clowns.

01:43.625 --> 01:44.756
Wa-Hey there!

01:44.800 --> 01:46.889
-The Burger Clown!

01:46.932 --> 01:48.456
That's me!

01:48.499 --> 01:51.111
I'm so happy you could
make our grand opening!

01:51.154 --> 01:52.199
If you need anything,

01:52.460 --> 01:54.679
be sure to ask one of our
helpful employees!

01:55.158 --> 01:57.073
Oh? B-burger?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.206
Burger? Burger! Burger!

02:00.294 --> 02:01.556
Burger ordered.

02:01.599 --> 02:04.385
-Burger.-Thank you for
comingto Burger Clown.

02:04.428 --> 02:06.169
Wow, Gloria, you work here now?

02:06.213 --> 02:08.780
Aw man, you get to work at
the best place on earth!

02:08.824 --> 02:10.739
You must be so happy!

02:10.782 --> 02:13.307
Yes. All my dreams
are coming true.

02:13.350 --> 02:16.179
Hmm. Super Burger,
Extra-Double Burger...

02:16.223 --> 02:17.963
Deep-Fried Cotton Candy Burger?

02:18.007 --> 02:19.269
Seems like a bit much.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.097
Well, luckily for you,

02:21.141 --> 02:23.317
for the first week of our
grand opening special,

02:23.360 --> 02:25.797
all our customers
get to eat for free!

02:25.841 --> 02:28.104
Here, pal, first one's on me!

02:31.673 --> 02:33.240
Oh, uh, I...

02:33.283 --> 02:35.764
Bill! If someone's
offering you a free meal,

02:35.807 --> 02:37.069
you take them up on it!

02:38.767 --> 02:40.464
Yay!

02:42.988 --> 02:45.904
Man. Food, toys,
and burger mascots?

02:45.948 --> 02:47.776
Heaven does exist!

02:47.819 --> 02:50.692
Usually we only get toeat at
Burger Clownevery once in awhile,

02:50.735 --> 02:54.739
- but now that it's right next
door we can eat it every day!
- Yeah!

02:54.783 --> 02:57.002
What? Oh, no,
we couldn't do that.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.875
Why not? Do you hate
thingsthat are good and fun?

02:59.918 --> 03:01.920
Burger Clown can be good
in moderation,

03:01.964 --> 03:04.619
but it isn't what I'd call
a balanced diet.

03:04.662 --> 03:05.968
It's plenty balanced!

03:06.011 --> 03:08.231
Fries are made of <i>potatoes.</i>

03:08.275 --> 03:10.320
Plus you got pickles
on that li'l burger of yours.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.453
That's practically a salad, Dad!

03:12.496 --> 03:14.629
"Practically a salad"
isn't a salad!

03:14.672 --> 03:16.021
If you ate Burger Clown
every day,

03:16.065 --> 03:18.459
I bet it'd make you sick
within a week!

03:18.502 --> 03:21.244
You know what, Dad?
I'll take that bet!

03:21.288 --> 03:23.812
"Bet"? No, I was speaking
metaphorically...

03:23.855 --> 03:25.596
Ye-heh-hess, a bet!

03:25.640 --> 03:27.598
Me and Tilly are gonna eat
at Burger Clown

03:27.642 --> 03:31.080
for every meal for a whole week
and prove you wrong!

03:31.123 --> 03:33.865
- I don't need you to...
- It's on, old man!

03:35.606 --> 03:38.696
Burger Clown!
Burger Clown! Burger Clown!

03:38.740 --> 03:40.524
How can I help you...?

03:40.568 --> 03:43.223
Hiya, kids!
Say, where are your parents?

03:43.266 --> 03:44.920
Our dad's being ridiculous!

03:44.963 --> 03:47.575
And not in a funny-clown
kinda way.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.620
- Hyuk!
- But, good news,

03:49.664 --> 03:51.709
We're gonna be
eatin' here all week!

03:51.753 --> 03:54.364

04:42.804 --> 04:44.371
Wakey, wakey, Tilly!

04:44.414 --> 04:46.111
Ready to get down
with the clown?

04:46.155 --> 04:49.289
Ugh. I don't feel very good.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.378
Dang, you're lookin'
a little greener than usual.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.336
Nothin' a little food
can't fix right?

04:53.380 --> 04:54.555
Everything all right in here?

04:54.598 --> 04:56.644
Kids?! Oh, my gosh,
are you okay?

04:56.687 --> 04:59.211
Pssh. We're fine,
right, Tilly?

04:59.255 --> 05:02.302
Actually, Papa,
I feel the contrary.

05:02.345 --> 05:05.609
I don't want to look at
another burger ever again.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.350
Oh, no, my poor sweet baby!

05:07.394 --> 05:10.005
See, Cricket? This is exactly
what I said would happen!

05:10.048 --> 05:12.616
Oh, she'll be fine once
she gets a burger or two in her.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.749
Nope, that does it!
I'm putting my foot down!

05:14.792 --> 05:16.707
No more fast food for a while.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.230
Sounds chill.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.885
Oh, what?! Come on,
don't cut us off now!

05:20.929 --> 05:22.365
We're perfectly...

05:22.409 --> 05:24.933
fine...

05:24.976 --> 05:26.693
Cricket, you couldn't even
finish that sentence

05:26.717 --> 05:27.936
without running out of breath!

05:27.979 --> 05:29.459
Just look at you
and your sister!

05:29.503 --> 05:30.808
You're destroying yourselves!

05:30.852 --> 05:32.723
Go away, burger demons!

05:32.767 --> 05:34.812
Haunt me no more.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.771
Now I'm gonna chop
some fresh chard for Tilly.

05:36.814 --> 05:39.208
Don't you even think about
trying to go to Burger Clown!

05:39.251 --> 05:41.819
Hmph! We'll see about that!

05:43.212 --> 05:45.780
Hey, buddy.
Good to see ya!

05:45.823 --> 05:49.349
H-hey, Cricket!
Are... are you doing okay?

05:49.392 --> 05:51.351
Y-you look... different.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.265
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
everything's good.

05:53.309 --> 05:56.225
My whole thing looks weird when
I'm not wearing the overalls.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.922
So! You got "the stuff"?

05:57.966 --> 05:59.489
I do indeed!

05:59.533 --> 06:01.578
Yes...

06:01.622 --> 06:03.406
Now hurry.
Gotta keep extra quiet...

06:03.450 --> 06:05.930
so we don't alert...
Ahh! Daddy!

06:05.974 --> 06:07.192
Hello, boys.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.846
Hello, Mr. Green.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.370
You know that's
a nice jacket, Remy.

06:10.413 --> 06:13.329
Odd choice to wear
a winter coat this time of year.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.635
Be cool, man...

06:14.678 --> 06:17.159
I have thin blood
and am often chilly!

06:24.122 --> 06:26.081
- Remy...
- I'm sorry!

06:26.124 --> 06:27.691
It's okay. Just go home.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.824
I need to have
a private talk with my son.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.304
And please put a shirt on.

06:32.348 --> 06:33.654
- Okay...
- What?!

06:33.697 --> 06:36.265
It's not my fault
Remy likes <i>sharing!</i>

06:36.308 --> 06:37.875
Cricket, go to your room.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.964
-Hmph!

06:40.008 --> 06:41.662
What does Dad know anyway?!

06:41.705 --> 06:43.620
I can eat as many burgers
as I want!

06:43.664 --> 06:45.230
Nothing bad's gonna happen!

06:46.144 --> 06:48.408
Hmph!

06:49.844 --> 06:51.715
But... maybe he has a point.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.588
Lately I haven't felt like
my rascally ol' self.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.852
Now what is going on out there?

06:59.854 --> 07:02.204
Ahhh...!

07:03.814 --> 07:05.381
Ah, that's the stuff.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.601
So how're you likingall the fresh food,
Tilly?

07:07.644 --> 07:09.690
Oh, Papa! It's marvelous!

07:09.733 --> 07:12.606
I can see clearly,
breathe deeply,

07:12.649 --> 07:15.130
it's as if my senses
are heightened!

07:15.173 --> 07:17.306
Tilly,
that's just your bodyreturning to normal.

07:17.349 --> 07:18.960
But I'm glad
you're enjoying the food.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.962
Wish I could say the same
for your brother...

07:21.005 --> 07:23.094
Well, from now on,
I plan on eating

07:23.138 --> 07:25.445
any fruit or veggie
I can get my hands on!

07:25.488 --> 07:28.448
Who knows what other sensory
powers they'll unlock?

07:28.491 --> 07:30.537
- Aaah...
- Hmm...

07:30.580 --> 07:32.408
Maybe it's time to
check up on him.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.323
Cricket? How're you doin', son?

07:34.366 --> 07:35.866
I know things got
a little tense earlier,

07:35.890 --> 07:38.066
but, um, Son?

07:39.502 --> 07:41.678
Cricket.
Where the heck did he go?!

07:42.853 --> 07:44.028
He was here moments ago.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.117
My newly heightened
sense of smell

07:46.161 --> 07:48.990
can track his greasy essence.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.514
He tried to squeeze
through a secret exit...

07:51.558 --> 07:52.907
but failed.

07:52.950 --> 07:55.344
Exhausted, he took
a sweat nap on the floor.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.912
And then
he jumped out the window.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.261
Say what you want about him,

07:59.304 --> 08:01.132
but he leaves
a clean silhouette.

08:01.176 --> 08:03.221
-OH, my Gosh.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.745
Burger Clown opened...

08:04.788 --> 08:06.268
<i>a play place?!</i>

08:06.921 --> 08:09.314
Hey, you're not supposed
to eat in here.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.316
What are ya, a cop?
You gonna arrest me?

08:12.709 --> 08:14.798
Yeah, come back when
you have a real story.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.888
Cricket! Enough is enough!
Time to go home.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.542
No! This is my home now!

08:19.586 --> 08:21.694
I'm gonna live in the Play Place
and sleep in the ball pit

08:21.718 --> 08:23.981
and live off of Burger Clown
burgers forever!

08:24.025 --> 08:25.026
Just try to stop me!

08:25.722 --> 08:27.724
Oh, come on...!
"Kids Only"?

08:27.768 --> 08:29.813
Well, rules are rules.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.512
Veggie powers! Activate!

08:33.643 --> 08:35.384
Cricket? Come home!

08:35.427 --> 08:38.300
- Give up on this burger fantasy!
- No!

08:40.824 --> 08:43.610
Come on.
There we go.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.090
Cricket!

08:46.134 --> 08:47.657
Huh?

08:48.266 --> 08:49.964
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.706
Ahh!

08:52.749 --> 08:53.837
Gotcha!

08:53.881 --> 08:55.709
Gah! Big sister strength!

08:55.752 --> 08:57.798
- Pocket mustard!
- Whoa!

09:00.844 --> 09:02.498
Boy, this ain't a running body.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.719
Brother...
Time to eat your vegetables.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.024
Uh...

09:07.068 --> 09:09.026
My sweet burger! Ahhh!

09:10.245 --> 09:13.117
No! It burns. I'm blind!

09:13.161 --> 09:15.859
I'm gonna be a Burger Clown
and none of you can stop me!

09:17.382 --> 09:21.169
Aw, rats.

09:21.212 --> 09:22.779
Everything okay in there,
Cricket?

09:22.823 --> 09:23.954
Are ya stuck?

09:23.998 --> 09:27.436
No! Well, yeah.
But on purpose!

09:27.479 --> 09:30.961
Yeah! On purpose.
This is everything I wanted!

09:31.005 --> 09:33.703
Me, the slide, and Burger Clown!

09:33.747 --> 09:35.313
Cricket, look at yourself!

09:35.357 --> 09:37.141
You're out of breath,
you feel terrible,

09:37.185 --> 09:38.665
and you're stuck in a slide!

09:38.708 --> 09:40.623
Do you really wanna spend
the rest of your life

09:40.667 --> 09:41.972
in a slide?

09:42.016 --> 09:44.453
We're here on Day 43
of the Burger Vigil...

09:44.496 --> 09:46.411
Come back to us, Cricket!

09:46.455 --> 09:47.935
Brought you a present, son.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.066
Wish you could see it.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.634
You're an old butt now.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.375
Was it worth it, brother?

09:53.418 --> 09:54.768
Oh.

09:55.246 --> 09:57.031
Hey, Dad...?

09:57.074 --> 09:58.206
Yes, Cricket?

09:58.249 --> 10:00.208
I don't wanna live in a slide,

10:00.251 --> 10:03.080
and I don't wanna only eat
Burger Clown anymore,

10:03.124 --> 10:06.170
and I realize you were just
lookin' out for me.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.824
So, thanks, Dad.

10:07.868 --> 10:08.912
It's okay, son.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.087
You wanna go home?

10:10.131 --> 10:12.829
Uh-huh!

10:12.873 --> 10:14.614
Then let's get outta this slide.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.573
Uh-oh.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.097
Hey, they're stuck!

10:20.141 --> 10:21.838
Scandal at Burger Clown!

10:21.882 --> 10:24.058
Two innocent customers
stuck in a slide.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.123
Turns out it was the only thing
that could take down

10:26.147 --> 10:28.366
Burger Clown's
newest restaurant.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.238
I'm here withMr. Burger Clown himself.

10:30.281 --> 10:31.935
Mr. Burger Clown, how are you doing?

10:31.979 --> 10:33.284
Why, I'm fine!

10:33.328 --> 10:35.678
It'll take a sack of hammers
to take me out!

10:35.722 --> 10:39.726
Hey kiddos, come visit any one
of my other 600 locations!

10:39.769 --> 10:41.031
Hyuk!

10:43.686 --> 10:45.862
He may be a clown,
but I'm not laughing.

10:45.906 --> 10:48.430
I'm Maria Media
with <i>Channel 11 News.</i>

10:49.649 --> 10:51.563
Well, all's well that ends well.

10:51.607 --> 10:54.088
Sorry about your favorite place
closing down, Cricket.

10:54.131 --> 10:56.699
Ah, it's fine.
It's probably better this way.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.179
That's a good point, Son.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.137
Hey all this talk is
makin' me hungry.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.096
- Let's go get some
Burger Clown.
- No!
