01:17.327 --> 01:19.029
<i>Achtung</i>!

03:24.454 --> 03:27.623
It was in the Clouvet
collection, wasn't it?

03:27.624 --> 03:29.041
It was.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.163
- Do you like it?
- Need you ask?

03:47.811 --> 03:50.434
This is degenerate art, you know.

03:51.648 --> 03:55.193
As a loyal officer of the Third
Reich, I should detest it.

03:56.987 --> 04:00.489
I've often wondered at the curious
conceit that would attempt

04:00.490 --> 04:04.490
to determine tastes
and ideas by decree.

04:07.789 --> 04:11.625
Many times over the past four
years I have wanted to thank you.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.754
For not being what you'd expected?

04:14.755 --> 04:18.380
For saving all this. Protecting it.

04:19.216 --> 04:24.969
Do you feel free to thank me now because
the liberation of Paris is so close?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.842
Perhaps.

04:27.684 --> 04:31.684
- It's not necessary.
- I could have been sent away.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.810
Someone else brought in to
be in charge of the museum.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.320
Perhaps I should thank you.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.652
I was foolish.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.705
I knew of books being burned.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.741
Other things.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.713
I was terrified that
these would be lost.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.299
A book is worth a few francs.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.803
We Germans can afford
to destroy those.

05:03.804 --> 05:08.891
We all may not appreciate artistic
merit, but cash value is another matter.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.519
You won't convince me
that you're cynical.

05:11.520 --> 05:15.350
I know what these
paintings mean to you.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.273
You are a perceptive woman.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.946
We're removing the paintings.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.578
- Pack them carefully.
- Where are you taking them?

05:29.579 --> 05:33.749
- To a safe place.
- But no place is as safe as Paris.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.329
The city has been declared open.
It won't be bombed or shelled.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.124
Captain.

05:40.924 --> 05:45.755
I want these at the station tomorrow,
crated and ready to be put on the train.

08:06.528 --> 08:10.198
- What about my train?
- It has been canceled, sir.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.369
- Who canceled it?
- I did.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.705
- Who are you?
- Labiche, Colonel. Area Inspector.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.250
Under my supervision, of course.

08:21.251 --> 08:25.879
Since when does a Frenchman have the
authority to cancel a German train?

08:25.880 --> 08:28.424
We're making up a special
armament train, Colonel.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.877
Highest priority.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.054
- Whose orders?
- Von Rundstedt.

08:34.054 --> 08:36.474
Military Commander, Western Front.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.306
How soon can my train
be cleared to leave?

08:44.065 --> 08:47.940
As soon as I get another order.
It's your army, Colonel, not mine.

08:48.361 --> 08:52.486
You'll get the order. Have the train
ready this afternoon at 3.30.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.004
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.320
I'm calling for General Von Lubitz.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.656
I want the line for the
Field Command Headquarters.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.029
Yes, immediately!

09:37.786 --> 09:41.205
Field Command Headquarters?
General Von Lubitz's office calling.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.874
Colonel Muller, please.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.978
I tried to reach you,
Colonel Von Waldheim.

10:04.979 --> 10:08.398
The general canceled all appointments
not dealing with the evacuation of Paris.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.817
- Is he in? Alone?
- Yes, Colonel,

10:09.818 --> 10:11.816
but I have orders not
to let anyone in...

10:20.787 --> 10:24.582
- What is it, Colonel?
- A train I ordered was canceled.

10:25.542 --> 10:29.588
I've been advised your personal
authorization is now required.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.048
Signal from General
Von Rundstedt, sir.

10:33.049 --> 10:37.675
The highway between Avranches and
Mortain has been cut by the Americans.

10:40.807 --> 10:44.181
You can make application
through normal channels.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.187
You once said normal
channels were a trap,

10:47.188 --> 10:50.562
in which to snare officers
who lacked initiative.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.487
What's your cargo?

11:13.882 --> 11:16.592
I don't share your
enthusiasm for art.

11:16.593 --> 11:21.680
Even if I did, it would not be
centered on this degenerate trash.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.727
Nor would I expect priority over
vitally needed war transport.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.145
Good morning, Colonel.

11:29.856 --> 11:33.692
The second SS armored division
has fallen back towards Falaise.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.817
Report on their remaining
effective strength.

11:37.989 --> 11:43.992
Might it not be unwise to leave a billion
gold reichsmarks in the Bank of France?

11:44.454 --> 11:47.498
Enough money to equip
ten panzer divisions?

11:53.421 --> 11:55.214
Make your point, Colonel.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.509
Money is a weapon.

11:59.052 --> 12:04.304
The contents of that train are as
negotiable as gold, and more valuable.

12:05.016 --> 12:09.062
I feel Berlin would prefer it in
the hands of the Third Reich.

12:27.538 --> 12:28.622
I must warn you, Colonel.

12:28.623 --> 12:32.873
If conditions at the front become more
critical, I will rescind this authorization.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.234
When will you be ready?

12:57.235 --> 13:00.564
Train will be ready to leave
tomorrow morning at 9:15, Major.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.559
Come in. Come in.

13:45.616 --> 13:49.411
This is Mademoiselle Villard from
the Jeu de Paume, the museum.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.034
I brought her with me.

14:00.715 --> 14:03.258
Mademoiselle Villard has a problem.

14:03.259 --> 14:07.012
- I thought your group might help her.
- It's not to help me.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.968
You understand? The
paintings belong to France.

14:11.601 --> 14:15.228
- Paintings?
- The train you are preparing for the Colonel.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.481
He's stealing a load of pictures.

14:17.482 --> 14:20.652
You should hear what they're worth!

14:21.277 --> 14:24.529
- It's not just the money.
- What does she want us to do?

14:24.530 --> 14:28.784
- She wants us to blow up the train.
- Oh, no! No, you misunderstand.

14:28.785 --> 14:33.205
They must not even be damaged.
They could never be replaced.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.330
They're not just...
Here, I have the list.

14:39.170 --> 14:44.297
Renoirs, CÃ©zannes, 64
Picassos, 29 Braques.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.468
Degas, Matisse.

14:46.469 --> 14:51.807
He chose very carefully. Only
the best. The national heritage.

14:51.808 --> 14:55.477
- What do you want us to do, madame?
- Mademoiselle.

14:55.478 --> 14:59.273
Well, I thought, perhaps, if
you could just stop the train.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.820
Stopping the train is not
simple, mademoiselle.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.323
- You can get killed stopping a train.
- Especially if you are French,

15:08.324 --> 15:10.526
and the train is German.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.863
I know. I realize.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.705
But soon Paris will be
free, isn't that true?

15:20.294 --> 15:22.462
But if the paintings
are not here...

15:22.463 --> 15:25.966
Our latest report is that the Allies
will be in Paris within a week.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.051
Maybe three or four days.

15:28.052 --> 15:31.179
Von Waldheim has to get the
train out before that.

15:31.180 --> 15:35.351
Can we slow it down?
Delay it? What do you think?

15:36.894 --> 15:39.096
We can blow it up. Maybe.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.649
Put some plastique under
the cars and blow it up.

15:42.650 --> 15:46.194
They'd shoot a few hostages,
but that's the price you pay.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.865
- Are your paintings that important?
- She doesn't want it blown up.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.534
London agrees the art is important.

15:52.535 --> 15:56.830
Anything we can do to save it.
But they leave it up to us.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.534
Why not? What can they lose?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.545
This morning we had four
men left in this group.

16:03.546 --> 16:07.591
Now we are three. One, two, three.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.302
- Bernard?
- We started with 18.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.555
Like your paintings, <i>mademoiselle,</i>
we couldn't replace them.

16:13.556 --> 16:18.059
For certain things, we take the risk.
But I won't waste lives on paintings.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.433
But they wouldn't be wasted.

16:21.397 --> 16:26.023
Excuse me. I know that's
a terrible thing to say.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.739
But those paintings
are part of France.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.241
The Germans want to take them away.

16:33.242 --> 16:37.621
They've taken our land, our
food. They live in our houses.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.416
And now they're trying
to take our art.

16:41.250 --> 16:45.830
This beauty, this vision of
life born out of France.

16:46.297 --> 16:49.376
Our special vision. Our trust.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.929
We hold it in trust. Don't you see?

16:53.930 --> 16:58.055
For everyone. This is our pride.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.558
What we create and
hold for the world.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.273
There are worse things to
risk your life for than that.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.728
I'm sorry, mademoiselle.
We can't help you.

17:13.491 --> 17:16.991
The train goes through his
section. It's up to him.

17:17.994 --> 17:20.414
Don't you have copies of 'em?

17:22.959 --> 17:26.086
Excuse me for taking your time.

17:26.087 --> 17:29.005
I respect you for
what you are doing.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.675
I hope none of you will be harmed.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.937
- She's a nice lady.
- What happened to Bernard?

17:45.731 --> 17:49.151
I had a cup of coffee with
him early this morning.

17:49.735 --> 17:53.860
They came into the yards and
picked him up, with some refugees.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.609
I saw the whole thing.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.289
They just came into the
yards and picked him up.

18:02.290 --> 18:05.208
I thought we came here to talk
about the armament train.

18:05.209 --> 18:08.336
It's a big one, huh, Labiche?
When does it leave?

18:08.337 --> 18:10.922
9:15 tomorrow morning, on the dot.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.127
They must be desperate
to risk a daylight run.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.301
Tell me the schedule.

18:17.722 --> 18:20.682
It'll arrive at the yards
at Vaires by 9:45.

18:20.683 --> 18:24.477
Five minutes to switch on the armored
engine and pick up the antiaircraft crews.

18:24.478 --> 18:28.228
It should be on its way by ten
minutes of ten, no later.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.615
It would be nice if it were
delayed for ten minutes.

18:40.870 --> 18:44.998
British planes will hit the yard at
Vaires tomorrow morning at 10:00.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.917
Saturation bombing.

18:48.711 --> 18:51.212
If the train was in the
yard at that time...

18:51.213 --> 18:53.256
Ten minutes? It won't be easy.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.755
Can you do it?

18:59.138 --> 19:02.763
- At the moment, I'm not sure how.
- That's up to you.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.894
The planes will bomb
at exactly 10:00.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.893
Will the train be there or not?

19:12.068 --> 19:13.611
We'll have it waiting.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.619
I wonder where he'll be at 10:00.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.369
Where I'd like to be.
In his office.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.501
- I don't like it.
- Who does?

19:29.502 --> 19:31.378
I mean the art train.

19:31.379 --> 19:35.048
If the Germans want it so much,
maybe we should do something.

19:35.049 --> 19:38.002
Forget the art train. We'll
have enough to do tomorrow.

19:39.762 --> 19:43.432
Which reminds me, I'll need another
engineer for the art train.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.395
- I'll have to give it to Papa Boule.
- Papa Boule?

19:48.396 --> 19:52.023
- Not Papa Boule!
- I have no choice. Who else is there?

19:52.024 --> 19:55.026
It's an easy run. The train
doesn't leave till dark.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.025
It'll be in Germany by morning.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.320
See you later.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.872
Don't just slap the oil
on anywhere, damn it!

20:07.873 --> 20:10.075
Look where the hell
you're putting it.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.045
This machine was running
before you were born.

20:14.046 --> 20:19.092
She's like a woman. If you don't treat her
just right, she'll make your life miserable.

20:19.093 --> 20:22.095
Take this. Do it right,
for God's sake.

20:22.096 --> 20:25.807
Because I'll be back to check
after I've had my coffee.

20:25.808 --> 20:29.478
Now remember. A grease
job is not a bath.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.500
- Papa.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.003
A cup.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.681
I see Labiche is finally
giving you a train.

21:07.892 --> 21:11.312
- And all the way to Germany.
- Some train.

21:11.395 --> 21:15.356
You see any artillery? A load
that a man can feel is important?

21:15.357 --> 21:17.525
That might change the war, huh?

21:17.526 --> 21:20.149
Any important shipment
goes to the front.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.152
Boule.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.992
Have you read what's
in those crates?

21:25.993 --> 21:30.747
I don't believe anything they
write. Paintings! Open a case.

21:30.748 --> 21:34.751
You'll find champagne, perfume and
everything else they stole from us.

21:34.752 --> 21:38.957
I've talked to one of the truck
drivers. These are paintings.

21:40.174 --> 21:44.004
- So what?
- Great art. Picasso. Gauguin. Renoir.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.975
Renoir. I used to know a
girl who modeled for Renoir.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.974
She smelled of paint.

21:54.396 --> 21:58.772
Boule, you are a good engineer,
you have told me so.

21:59.068 --> 22:02.237
But in matters of culture,
you are sadly deficient.

22:02.238 --> 22:06.033
Champagne and perfume
can be replaced. Not art.

22:06.700 --> 22:10.200
- These paintings are important.
- Really?

22:11.372 --> 22:12.915
The glory of France.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.084
Glory of France?

22:16.085 --> 22:21.256
And to think, two days, three at the
most, the Allies should be here.

22:21.257 --> 22:25.257
The Nazis wouldn't have the
train. Maybe even one day...

22:26.929 --> 22:29.764
- Are you the engineer?
- Does he look like an engineer?

22:29.765 --> 22:33.184
You will not leave the station
tonight. Stand by your engine,

22:33.185 --> 22:35.520
ready to leave at a
moment's notice.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.072
- Pig!
- Be careful how you talk to them.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.321
I'm too old to be careful.

22:52.329 --> 22:55.499
- The glory of France.
- Huh? Oh, yes.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.585
The glory of France.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.008
Give me the change in franc pieces.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.013
Engineer!

23:16.145 --> 23:17.688
Start the engine!

24:28.467 --> 24:30.089
Heil Hitler.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.762
Loaded and ready, sir.

24:40.104 --> 24:41.851
Very good, Schmidt.

24:42.231 --> 24:45.900
- What time do you leave?
- As soon as it's dark, sir.

24:45.901 --> 24:49.445
Colonel Von Waldheim!
Telephone call, sir.

24:49.446 --> 24:52.320
General Von Lubitz's headquarters!

24:55.953 --> 24:58.201
The officer says it's urgent.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.466
Colonel Von Waldheim speaking.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.460
Yes, Major.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.423
I'm sorry to hear that.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.843
Let's hope the reverses at
the front are temporary.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.937
Yes, of course I understand.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.940
The general explained
it might be necessary

25:25.941 --> 25:28.815
to rescind the authorization
for my train.

25:32.239 --> 25:37.285
Unfortunately, I can't help you.
The train left over half an hour ago,

25:37.286 --> 25:39.864
and is now on its way to Germany.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.833
Please express my
regrets to the general.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.799
In view of the fact that
you've already left, Schmidt,

25:51.800 --> 25:55.428
I think perhaps you'd better get aboard
and order the train out immediately, huh?

25:55.429 --> 25:58.348
- Yes, sir!
- Have a good trip, Schmidt.

25:59.308 --> 26:02.352
Start the train! Start the train!

26:03.145 --> 26:04.847
Move the train!

26:07.816 --> 26:10.690
Boule! Start the train.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.022
Start the train!

28:16.153 --> 28:19.152
Uncouple that engine!
Get it out of here!

28:40.010 --> 28:41.761
Is the armored engine ready?

28:41.762 --> 28:44.385
Yes, sir. The antiaircraft
crews are all aboard.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.851
Move your engine.
Get it out of here!

30:04.928 --> 30:08.055
Hey, you! You pig!

30:08.056 --> 30:09.640
- What?
- Who did that?

30:09.641 --> 30:12.059
The steam is released
or the engine blows up.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.354
- Which do you want?
- You did it on purpose.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.107
What is this?

30:26.908 --> 30:29.577
Take your assigned position.
Back of the cab.

30:29.578 --> 30:32.038
- Everything all right?
- Move your engines...

30:32.039 --> 30:34.790
- It's okay.
- Go back. I want this train out of here!

30:34.791 --> 30:36.038
Okay.

30:37.919 --> 30:41.623
- What's going on down there, Labiche?
- Sabotage.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.358
Throw five.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.820
Throw eight.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.746
Throw ten.

32:47.883 --> 32:49.551
- Throw ten.
- It's stuck!

32:52.053 --> 32:53.755
Don't force it.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.867
- Stop!
- Hey! Hey!

33:18.371 --> 33:20.744
Hey! Stop!

33:21.041 --> 33:24.040
Stop! You're on the wrong track!

33:28.381 --> 33:31.676
Don't play games with me, Labiche.
I know sabotage when I...

33:36.348 --> 33:37.765
What is it?

33:44.606 --> 33:46.058
But I...

33:50.070 --> 33:51.738
Give me the switch tower.

33:58.370 --> 34:01.622
Dietrich! What the hell
is going on up there?

34:01.623 --> 34:04.250
You idiot! You get those
switches working!

34:04.251 --> 34:07.002
We have got to get this
train out of here!

34:07.003 --> 34:09.672
I'm tired of your
inefficiency, Dietrich!

34:54.509 --> 34:57.177
You can't ride through an air raid!

34:57.178 --> 34:59.881
Watch me! Fire up that engine!

35:22.329 --> 35:24.872
You old goat! Get out of
there and get under cover!

35:24.873 --> 35:28.500
- Get off my train!
- You fool! It'll rain bombs any second!

35:28.501 --> 35:30.078
Get off my train!

35:33.757 --> 35:36.881
- You can't go! The switch is closed!
- Open it!

37:28.288 --> 37:29.865
What is it?

37:31.666 --> 37:33.243
What is it?

37:35.462 --> 37:36.663
Engineer!

37:39.966 --> 37:42.092
- What is it?
- The oil line.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.385
Can you fix it?

37:45.680 --> 37:49.726
- Can we run it back to Vaires?
- Maybe, but just the engine.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.061
Where's the phone?

37:57.066 --> 37:58.813
Start the pump.

38:50.745 --> 38:54.414
The repair of my train is to
take top priority, Major.

38:54.415 --> 38:58.752
This whole yard needs repair, Colonel.
I'll see to your engine as soon as I can.

38:58.753 --> 39:03.131
- You'll see to it at once.
- I have my orders. I'll do what I can.

39:03.132 --> 39:07.087
I've given you an order.
I take full responsibility.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.611
- What happened?
- Fault in the oil line.

39:24.612 --> 39:27.736
I'll take care of it.
Hand me the spanner.

39:29.617 --> 39:31.490
Take over the crane engine.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.497
Boule!

39:40.503 --> 39:41.875
Boule!

39:44.257 --> 39:45.504
Come here.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.837
Come here!

39:56.436 --> 39:58.980
- Take off the oil caps.
- I'll do it.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.689
He will do it. Go on.

40:17.206 --> 40:21.661
- You can settle the blame for this later.
- One moment, please, sir.

40:31.179 --> 40:32.972
Turn out your pants pockets.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.732
Slick with oil.

40:51.532 --> 40:54.743
Sabotage, Colonel. It's
an old trick around here.

40:54.744 --> 40:58.323
They slip in franc pieces
and cut off the oil supply.

41:02.543 --> 41:06.793
- You should have thrown them away.
- Four francs are four francs.

41:15.556 --> 41:18.976
Major, please. It's not important.
I'll have the engine fixed overnight.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.769
I'll work on it myself.

41:20.770 --> 41:22.392
Take him away.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.103
Colonel! Stop them.

41:30.071 --> 41:31.397
Wait.

41:33.574 --> 41:38.370
Colonel. He slowed up your train
for a few hours but he saved it.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.998
He took it through the bombs
at the risk of his own life.

41:40.999 --> 41:44.292
He's an old man. He doesn't
know what he's doing.

41:44.293 --> 41:48.296
I'll get your train through for you.
He's just a foolish old man.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.590
His train! His!

41:50.591 --> 41:52.092
It's my train.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.720
I know what I'm doing.

41:54.721 --> 41:57.723
Do you? Huh? You'll help them.

41:57.724 --> 42:02.600
I practically raised you, but
you're no better than they are.

42:03.896 --> 42:05.643
Swine!

42:18.327 --> 42:21.455
Colonel! What can you gain
by the death of one old man?

42:21.456 --> 42:24.041
- What he did can make no difference.
- <i>Achtung! Feuer!</i>

42:24.042 --> 42:25.208
You can stop...

42:29.881 --> 42:33.085
You will deliver that
engine to me personally.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.633
I'm holding you responsible.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.029
Simon!

44:24.579 --> 44:26.702
Turn on the forced-draft.

44:28.499 --> 44:32.377
Hurry it up! We're working on a
locomotive, not a pocket watch!

44:32.378 --> 44:35.548
Hubert! Take down the grate.

44:37.133 --> 44:40.428
Didont... What are you doing here?

44:41.220 --> 44:44.799
- Where's Hubert?
- I decided to go along as fireman.

44:46.184 --> 44:48.476
You damn fools. You
lookin' to be shot too?

44:48.477 --> 44:51.813
- Papa Boule wanted it stopped.
- Papa Boule! Papa Boule is dead!

44:51.814 --> 44:56.651
- Stop acting like children.
- Don't be mad, Paul. We want to do this.

44:56.652 --> 44:58.153
Listen, you idiots.

44:58.154 --> 45:01.699
The war'll be over in a few
days. Now leave it alone.

45:02.491 --> 45:06.537
You get caught up in something...
You can't leave it alone.

45:07.538 --> 45:10.912
- You know how it is.
- We'll get away with it, Paul.

45:11.292 --> 45:15.503
All contacts have been made except
at Metz, and you have to call Metz.

45:15.504 --> 45:18.798
Maurice won't go along with
us until he talks to you.

45:18.799 --> 45:21.843
Oh, you know Maurice.
He's stubborn.

45:22.887 --> 45:28.016
To hell with you. To hell with both of you.
You wanna be killed, I can't stop you.

45:28.017 --> 45:30.352
We will be killed if you
don't call Maurice.

45:30.353 --> 45:33.688
Labiche! Are you
taking the night off?

45:33.689 --> 45:38.193
It'll be ready in a couple of hours, by
morning. I'll take it through after dark.

45:38.194 --> 45:41.279
When it's ready get it
out of here. Deliver it.

45:41.280 --> 45:44.324
- In broad daylight?
- Deliver it.

45:44.325 --> 45:47.702
That engine has blocked work
on four trains for the front.

45:47.703 --> 45:53.083
The Colonel gave orders for it to
be given top priority. He's got it.

45:53.084 --> 45:59.214
For all I care, it could be shot full of
holes, and his precious train with it.

45:59.215 --> 46:00.667
Move it!

47:03.112 --> 47:04.529
Spitfire.

47:27.136 --> 47:31.261
- No! No, Didont!
- Not us! Not us!

47:32.266 --> 47:34.639
Not us! Not us!

49:37.391 --> 49:40.094
This is the last job. The last one.

49:57.870 --> 50:02.291
When we get to Rive-Reine,
I'll make that call to Maurice.

50:16.013 --> 50:20.468
- What happened?
- Allied aircraft, ten miles back.

50:20.518 --> 50:22.311
Any serious damage?

50:23.562 --> 50:24.979
Any serious damage?

50:24.980 --> 50:28.275
Not enough to stop you
from getting to Germany.

50:29.193 --> 50:31.691
Camouflage the engine. Schwartz!

50:32.988 --> 50:34.447
Your engine and your crew.

50:34.448 --> 50:38.535
Was it your clever idea to risk
this engine in a daylight run?

50:38.536 --> 50:41.535
Major Herren was following
your orders to the letter.

50:42.414 --> 50:45.291
I admire your efficiency, Labiche,

50:45.292 --> 50:47.669
and your sense of survival.

50:47.670 --> 50:51.591
I don't suppose you have much
trouble with saboteurs, do you?

50:51.882 --> 50:53.299
Tell me, Labiche.

50:53.300 --> 50:56.844
Do you think there will be
sabotage attempts on this train?

50:56.845 --> 50:58.972
I'm a rail road man, not a prophet.

50:58.973 --> 51:02.393
Prophecy is not required,
only determination.

51:03.227 --> 51:07.682
This train will get through to Germany.
You agree, don't you, Labiche?

51:08.065 --> 51:11.860
What do you want me to do,
Colonel? Give you a guarantee?

51:12.319 --> 51:14.613
I'll settle for a
partial guarantee.

51:15.781 --> 51:16.982
You, Labiche.

51:17.783 --> 51:19.360
You'll drive the engine.

51:19.994 --> 51:23.619
The engineer's been assigned.
My orders are to return to Vaires.

51:29.336 --> 51:31.879
Stay with the engine.
Keep steam up.

51:31.880 --> 51:34.549
You can go now. You're not needed.

51:36.135 --> 51:38.303
I've worked all night
on this engine.

51:38.304 --> 51:41.681
I haven't slept for two days.
I'll fall asleep at the control.

51:41.682 --> 51:45.432
You'll leave at 7:00. I think
you should rest until then.

51:45.853 --> 51:47.270
Take him to the hotel.

51:47.271 --> 51:50.441
He is to stay there until
he returns here at seven.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.063
Sleep well.

51:58.699 --> 52:00.276
My bicycle.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.449
Your transportation to Paris.

52:34.318 --> 52:35.690
<i>Danke.</i>

52:48.874 --> 52:52.078
- A room for this man.
- Identity card, please.

53:05.432 --> 53:07.134
- 60 francs.
- Pay her.

53:08.435 --> 53:10.808
You pay her. I'm a guest
of the German army.

53:13.774 --> 53:16.693
- He is a rail road man.
- 60 francs.

53:17.611 --> 53:20.655
- Isn't there a discount for rail road men?
- 60 francs.

53:27.329 --> 53:30.623
Top of the stairs, first door on
the right. The sheets are clean.

53:30.624 --> 53:31.825
Thank you.

53:32.876 --> 53:34.328
Labiche!

53:34.753 --> 53:38.297
You heard the Colonel. Seven
o'clock. Get some rest.

53:38.298 --> 53:40.045
Would like to tuck me in?

53:41.927 --> 53:43.504
Call me at 6:45.

55:21.819 --> 55:23.362
Pesquet.

55:24.988 --> 55:27.816
One German in the
office with Jacques.

55:28.242 --> 55:30.444
Give me about two minutes.

55:43.173 --> 55:45.091
Where are you going?

55:48.136 --> 55:50.714
Back in the engine.
Use your coal pile.

58:01.687 --> 58:04.522
- What started this?
- We don't know, sir.

58:04.523 --> 58:07.647
You aren't all needed.
Get back to the train.

58:24.251 --> 58:27.336
- Where's Labiche?
- I put him in the hotel, sir.

58:27.337 --> 58:29.130
A few minutes ago.

58:32.467 --> 58:34.635
- Sergeant!
- You two, come!

58:59.953 --> 59:01.162
Labiche!

59:02.330 --> 59:03.531
Labiche!

59:05.625 --> 59:07.168
Break it down.

59:14.134 --> 59:15.631
Look in the cellar!

59:20.307 --> 59:24.262
- Why are you breaking down my door?
- Labiche, where is he?

59:26.354 --> 59:28.147
Who's your commanding officer?

59:28.148 --> 59:29.474
Captain!

59:34.321 --> 59:36.194
Mademoiselle, come here!

59:39.618 --> 59:41.866
How long has he been here?

59:45.832 --> 59:49.252
Since soup, cabbage and potatoes.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.904
Thank you.

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:19.949
I don't want your thanks.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:23.244
If they'd caught me helping
you, I would have been shot.

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:24.703
I know. I'm sorry.

01:00:24.704 --> 01:00:27.331
You think you can run in
here and make trouble?

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:28.874
I run a hotel, not a madhouse.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.669
Who's going to pay for
the door and the lock?

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:33.963
Do you think money grows on trees?

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.423
- There's a war.
- You talk about the war.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:38.501
I'll talk about what it costs.

01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:47.060
I'll be leaving in a few hours. You
can go back to your good customers.

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:50.271
They pay. That's what
I'm in business for.

01:00:50.939 --> 01:00:52.436
You should be paid.

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:58.438
- How much for the damage?
- 100 francs.

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:04.031
How much for saving my life?

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:14.628
Who did it?

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:20.384
I'm not sure. I can't
remember. I was struck!

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:21.837
You're lying!

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.472
Enough, Pilzer.

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:36.977
If you tell the truth, you'll live.

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:40.487
Now, what does he look like?

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:42.486
Colonel, I can't remember!

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.322
A big man.

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.416
A gray suit.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.377
A hat, I think.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:58.673
Sir, Labiche never left the hotel.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:02.460
Let him go.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.570
Do you want some coffee?

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:34.409
It goes with the room.

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:36.836
No extra charge.

01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:39.872
What's your name?

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:44.006
Labiche, the Colonel is waiting.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.308
Christine.

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:09.368
Did you get through?

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:13.824
- Jacques, is the track all clear up ahead?
- All the way to Germany.

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:18.878
Sleep well, Labiche?

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.379
Like a baby, Colonel.

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:33.017
I trust this time the
bearings are well-oiled?

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:35.060
Why don't you check them yourself?

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.558
Sergeant!

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.316
Sergeant Schwartz
will ride with you.

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:44.361
The last town before entering
Germany will be St. Avold.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:48.282
You will stop there for Captain
Schmidt to telephone a report to me.

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:50.576
A pleasant trip, Captain.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.154
Is that clear?

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:55.957
I will stop at St. Avold.

01:03:57.751 --> 01:04:00.252
Have you ever been
to Germany, Labiche?

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:01.830
No, Colonel.

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:05.716
You should find the
experience interesting.

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:08.295
A chance to broaden your horizon.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.638
All right, stationmaster.

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:39.166
Just keep out of my way.

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:46.879
Stop at St. Avold, we'll
get our heads blown off.

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:30.881
Get me Commercy, please.

01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:36.891
I don't have a direct line.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.391
This is rail road business!

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:51.321
What's the matter?

01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:53.240
Your army regulations.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:07.084
Montmirail.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:20.760
ChÃ¢lons.

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:59.470
Hello, Metz? It's on time.

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:13.400
Hello, Metz? Rive-Reine.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:16.190
Is that you, Maurice?

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:18.575
Ah.

01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:20.403
Where is he?

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:23.497
When will he be back?

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:29.166
Have him call Jacques at
Rive-Reine as soon as possible.

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.247
Yes, it's important.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:33.090
Thank you.

01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:45.310
- What time will you be home, Uncle?
- When I get home, I'll be home!

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:47.229
I'm sitting enjoying myself!

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.565
Drinking, playing cards,
having a good time.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:51.650
You can see that, can't you?

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:54.149
Aunt Helene wanted to know.

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:56.280
Robert.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.868
I'm a bad tempered old man.

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:47.038
Why are we slowing down?

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:50.084
Are you blind? There's
been an air raid.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.578
We slow down for switching.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.134
What are you going to do?

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:11.063
I don't want to stop at St. Avold.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:13.312
You wanna go to Germany?

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:16.814
Jacques will send word.

01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:40.319
This is taking us south.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:44.114
I said this is taking us south!

01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:46.158
You saw the main
tracks are blown up.

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:48.994
We have to go around
the bend in the river.

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:50.912
What's the next town on your map?

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:52.865
RÃ©milly.

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:56.960
Keep your eyes open.

01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:58.641
Your horizon's about
to be broadened.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.340
Rive-Reine.

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:46.381
Ah, Maurice.

01:11:46.928 --> 01:11:50.013
Mmm. You have a direct
line to Commercy.

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:52.137
Right. Call them.

01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:56.394
My wife's cousin has
some cheese for me.

01:11:56.395 --> 01:12:00.190
It could be put on the midnight
train when it stops at Commercy.

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:02.734
Yes. Yes, Maurice.

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:06.109
The train will stop,
to unload passengers.

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:09.741
Good.

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:12.491
I'll save a piece
of cheese for you.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:15.823
Railroad business, huh?

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.617
Ah.

01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:43.480
Next stop, St. Avold, sir.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.008
Do we run?

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.386
Sergeant. Can we stretch our legs?

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.763
All right. Get down.

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:23.690
Corporal, watch them.

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:33.401
You! Where's the telephone?

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.828
Sergeant!

01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:38.496
Nobody leaves the train. We will
stop here only for two minutes.

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:40.620
<i>Ja</i>, Captain.

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:00.978
Tell Jacques the
cheese on the train.

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:05.395
And to save a piece
for Pierre and Raoul.

01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:12.030
Hello, Colonel.

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:14.734
Colonel, we are at St. Avold.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:17.365
Yes, Colonel.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.643
What's it like here in St. Avoid?

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:49.481
Well?

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:58.952
I know what you mean.

01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:01.746
I'll be glad to get back to Berlin.

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:04.541
- Schwartz!
- Yes, Captain?

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:07.002
- We go.
- Get up.

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:15.085
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:28.708
We are home, Tauber.

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.836
We are in Germany.

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:39.939
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:45.326
You're crazy! Why did you mean
speeding into a curve like that?

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:48.746
- But you told me to go ahead, didn't you?
- Yes, but at full speed?

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:49.831
What do you mean?

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:53.209
Hey, you should have signaled
to go slow! How should I know?

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:56.504
You're just as big a fool as your
brother, and he's the worst I ever saw!

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.127
Look at my rails!

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:16.642
How close?

01:18:17.985 --> 01:18:19.812
Two minutes.

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:21.780
Good luck.

01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:24.866
If anything happens,
if we get separated,

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:27.067
I'll meet you at the old
farmhouse above the river.

01:19:20.714 --> 01:19:22.507
Take the stick.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.608
Halt!

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:01.619
Pilzer! Get Labiche!

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:03.447
Yes, sir.

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:16.885
Get him! Kill him, kill him!

01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:20.256
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!

01:24:21.014 --> 01:24:23.140
Kill him! Kill him!

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:21.070
No. No, you can't stay here.

01:25:26.747 --> 01:25:28.574
Fire!

01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:33.328
Pilzer!

01:25:34.546 --> 01:25:38.467
- How soon will the cranes be here?
- Major Herren is on his way now, sir.

01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:41.469
Everything that can be done without heavy
equipment will be completed by dark.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.889
Put more men to work.
I want it done faster.

01:25:44.765 --> 01:25:47.639
But, Colonel, till the crane
can move the engines...

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:51.604
Yes, Colonel.

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:58.235
Sir! No sign of Labiche, sir.

01:25:58.236 --> 01:26:00.404
We searched the woods for hours.
We can't find him anywhere.

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:03.324
- I've had two squads looking...
- I want him!

01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:06.786
- He could have gone back to Paris.
- No.

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:09.747
He's around somewhere, I know.

01:26:09.748 --> 01:26:12.625
He'll twist and turn. He'll
hide and make his plans.

01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:15.124
But he won't leave the train.

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:16.962
I'm beginning to know him.

01:26:16.963 --> 01:26:19.757
Keep looking for him!
Search the town.

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:36.650
I've brought you some clothes.

01:26:37.317 --> 01:26:40.361
- How's your leg?
- Much better, thank you.

01:26:51.164 --> 01:26:54.334
- What's going on out there?
- You should know.

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:56.919
Engines and cars all
over the tracks.

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.542
Rails torn.

01:26:58.797 --> 01:26:59.998
Any reprisals?

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:03.509
Do you think they'd
declare a holiday?

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:08.140
Jacques, the stationmaster,
and an engineer shot.

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:12.554
Another engineer, the thin one,
was shot trying to escape.

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:14.604
Pesquet.

01:27:16.106 --> 01:27:18.525
There'll be others.

01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:38.708
Labiche. Have you seen
the man, Labiche?

01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:40.713
- Labiche?
- Yes, Labiche!

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:42.840
He was in room five.
He left yesterday!

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:44.675
Yes, he left yesterday.

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:46.469
I know that. I know
he left yesterday!

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:48.429
I want to know if you
have seen him here today!

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.973
Labiche, Labiche. Yes,
I've seen Labiche.

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:53.392
I see him every day. And
General de Gaulle too.

01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:57.643
They're my best customers and I
keep them cool in the wine cellar.

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:36.595
Please.

01:28:36.686 --> 01:28:38.896
Why did you come back here?

01:28:38.897 --> 01:28:41.273
Do you want everyone killed?

01:28:41.274 --> 01:28:45.027
Maybe you think you're a hero.
Maybe you don't care if you live.

01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:48.357
What right have you to
do this? Leave us alone.

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:53.949
I knew Jacques all my life.

01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:58.959
He and his wife sat with me
when my husband was killed,

01:28:59.084 --> 01:29:01.332
the first year of the war.

01:29:01.878 --> 01:29:04.046
And now I sit with her.

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:07.341
Men are such fools.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:11.054
Men want to be heroes
and their widows mourn.

01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:21.147
Perhaps men are fools.

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:28.195
There were over a hundred
involved in stopping that train.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:32.742
Switchmen, brakemen,
yard gangs, stationmasters.

01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:37.201
God knows how many will
be shot, like Jacques.

01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:42.459
You know what's on that train?

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:46.164
Paintings. That's right,
paintings. Art.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:52.053
The national heritage.
The pride of France.

01:29:56.433 --> 01:29:57.725
Crazy, isn't it?

01:30:09.446 --> 01:30:11.569
It's quiet up there.

01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:15.868
Where are you going?

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:18.162
Perhaps I can leave now.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:21.243
You can't take two steps in daylight.
They're looking for you everywhere.

01:30:21.499 --> 01:30:24.710
My friend who was with me on
the train, I have to meet him.

01:30:24.711 --> 01:30:25.836
He may not even be alive.

01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:29.712
It won't help him if you're
killed. Wait until it's dark.

01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:36.139
Eat your food.

01:30:38.683 --> 01:30:40.931
It's a sin to waste bread.

01:31:01.206 --> 01:31:03.249
Ready? Take it up.

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:28.350
Put it on its side over there.

01:31:29.693 --> 01:31:31.270
Major!

01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:34.572
Can't you move any faster?

01:31:34.906 --> 01:31:37.282
This is a hell of a mess you
have got here, Colonel.

01:31:37.283 --> 01:31:38.951
We're doing the best we can.

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:40.411
I asked for two cranes.

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:46.375
It took an order by staff
headquarters to get this one.

01:31:46.376 --> 01:31:49.830
With Von Rundstedt falling back, the army
has other uses for railway equipment.

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:53.799
All Von Rundstedt can lose is men.

01:31:53.967 --> 01:31:56.261
This train is more valuable.

01:32:31.337 --> 01:32:32.663
It's all right.

01:33:25.517 --> 01:33:28.596
At Commercy, they shot
the stationmaster.

01:33:29.938 --> 01:33:32.523
At Metz, they took hostages.

01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:35.443
Ten of them. Shot them on the spot.

01:33:36.528 --> 01:33:38.275
Kids, mostly.

01:33:39.155 --> 01:33:41.824
You know Lefevre,
the inspector there?

01:33:41.825 --> 01:33:44.403
His kid, the one with asthma?

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:46.575
They cured it for him.

01:33:48.248 --> 01:33:50.496
At ChÃ¢lons, three dead.

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:53.127
That's all I know so far.

01:33:54.587 --> 01:33:56.505
Pesquet was right.

01:33:57.257 --> 01:33:59.425
This was his last job.

01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:16.233
- What about the train?
- Mmm.

01:34:16.234 --> 01:34:18.778
It'll be ready to move tomorrow.

01:34:19.445 --> 01:34:21.943
Where the hell are the Allies?

01:34:22.574 --> 01:34:25.242
What are they taking, the
tourist route to Paris?

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:27.946
I'll believe them when I see them.

01:34:32.584 --> 01:34:34.786
In case they don't come.

01:35:11.664 --> 01:35:12.789
Labiche, it's me!

01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:15.869
- Who's with you?
- Robert, Jacques' nephew.

01:35:15.919 --> 01:35:17.792
Come in.

01:35:30.099 --> 01:35:32.848
I'm glad to see you're still alive.

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:37.019
You're to be complimented.

01:35:39.525 --> 01:35:41.147
That was quite a job you did.

01:35:41.486 --> 01:35:42.986
Where are the Allies?

01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:44.863
What shape is the train in?

01:35:44.864 --> 01:35:47.362
It'll be repaired by morning.

01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:48.655
Thank you.

01:35:52.914 --> 01:35:56.869
- When does it leave Rive-Reine?
- It won't move in daylight.

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:01.213
Where are the Allies?

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:05.836
It has been arranged for a French
division to reach Paris first. A gesture.

01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:09.218
A gesture?

01:36:09.847 --> 01:36:12.141
They can make gestures?

01:36:12.517 --> 01:36:15.394
Let them make one for
Pesquet or Jacques.

01:36:15.395 --> 01:36:18.724
That kid of Lefevre's,
he'd appreciate a gesture.

01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:22.852
What do you intend to do?

01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.321
This is what we intend
to do, plastique.

01:36:26.322 --> 01:36:27.823
What we should have
done in the first place.

01:36:27.824 --> 01:36:30.743
Tomorrow night, no Allies,
we blow the train to hell.

01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:33.701
London wants the train saved.

01:36:34.205 --> 01:36:35.789
What do they want us to do?

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:38.709
Stop it with our bare hands?
Lay down across the tracks?

01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:43.922
Right after dawn, all switching tracks
and trains in the area will be bombed.

01:36:43.923 --> 01:36:46.591
The art train is not
to be destroyed.

01:36:46.592 --> 01:36:50.217
Orders are to mark it so the
planes will pass it up.

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:53.303
- Mark it?
- White paint,

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:56.435
on the top of the first three cars.

01:36:56.436 --> 01:36:59.640
London has decided the
paintings must not be damaged.

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:04.519
Save it?

01:37:05.111 --> 01:37:07.939
For Von Waldheim?
Make him a present?

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:09.990
To hell with London.

01:37:09.991 --> 01:37:11.742
We started this whole
thing for one reason.

01:37:11.743 --> 01:37:15.078
To stop the train because the
Allies were going to be here.

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:17.706
Where are they? Every
day they've been due.

01:37:17.707 --> 01:37:20.834
And every day, a man has been killed for
thinking they were just over the hill.

01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:22.210
I say to hell with it!

01:37:22.211 --> 01:37:25.961
Now they want us to paint the
train? Let 'em blow it up!

01:37:35.266 --> 01:37:37.093
Paul.

01:37:38.436 --> 01:37:40.855
It'd be too bad if it got blown up.

01:37:41.356 --> 01:37:43.809
That is, if it could be saved.

01:37:45.318 --> 01:37:47.611
Papa Boule, Pesquet, the others,

01:37:47.612 --> 01:37:49.860
they wanted it saved.

01:37:49.864 --> 01:37:52.487
And they're dead,
and they'll never know.

01:37:54.327 --> 01:37:56.074
But we will.

01:37:56.412 --> 01:37:59.331
White paint. Just the
first three cars.

01:38:03.461 --> 01:38:05.834
I can find my way back.

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:20.811
You know what it's like down there?

01:38:20.812 --> 01:38:24.312
There are Germans all over the
place. You haven't got a chance!

01:38:25.983 --> 01:38:27.685
I'll figure something.

01:38:28.611 --> 01:38:30.070
What are you gonna do?

01:38:30.071 --> 01:38:32.697
You gonna walk up to the Germans and
tell them you want to paint the train

01:38:32.698 --> 01:38:35.033
so it will look nice when
it gets to Germany?

01:38:35.034 --> 01:38:36.827
Don't you see? It's hopeless.

01:38:36.828 --> 01:38:42.000
Those cars have been needing a coat
of paint ever since the war started.

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:49.378
You crazy bastard.

01:38:50.508 --> 01:38:52.801
Who are you gonna get to help you?

01:38:52.802 --> 01:38:54.428
Have you thought of that?

01:38:54.429 --> 01:38:56.723
Who are you gonna get to help you?

01:38:57.181 --> 01:38:59.008
Me.

01:38:59.183 --> 01:39:01.010
I can fight.

01:39:03.104 --> 01:39:06.854
That's two of us. A small army.

01:39:16.576 --> 01:39:19.119
- What do you shoot with this?
- Rabbits.

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.448
You're not fighting rabbits.

01:39:27.545 --> 01:39:29.379
How well do you know the
station in Rive-Reine?

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:31.381
- Have you got a plan?
- Shut up.

01:39:31.382 --> 01:39:34.131
- I lived there all my life.
- Can you get some men to help?

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.345
Not in Rive-Reine. They're
all working on the tracks.

01:39:37.346 --> 01:39:38.907
Even I serve food to the soldiers.

01:39:39.056 --> 01:39:40.257
Other towns?

01:39:42.143 --> 01:39:43.268
Montmirail.

01:39:43.269 --> 01:39:46.229
Uncle Jacques had friends there,
rail road men. I can get them.

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:48.933
- And paint?
- Yes. And brushes too.

01:39:49.108 --> 01:39:51.652
See about the men and the paint.

01:39:52.069 --> 01:39:54.488
Be back an hour before dawn.

01:40:07.418 --> 01:40:09.586
With luck,

01:40:12.173 --> 01:40:13.716
no one will be hurt.

01:40:14.425 --> 01:40:17.504
No one's ever hurt. Just dead.

01:40:23.643 --> 01:40:27.643
Paul, have you ever seen any of
those paintings on the train?

01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:29.849
I haven't.

01:40:30.399 --> 01:40:34.445
You know, when it's over, I think
maybe we should take a look.

01:42:25.139 --> 01:42:27.307
Alarm!

01:44:20.337 --> 01:44:21.584
Herren!

01:44:23.132 --> 01:44:24.879
Lights!

01:44:29.346 --> 01:44:30.798
Pilzer!

01:44:43.694 --> 01:44:45.862
Didont, get off! Get off!

01:45:07.718 --> 01:45:09.928
Didont! Didont, run, run!

01:46:14.076 --> 01:46:16.825
Not thunder, Colonel. Artillery.

01:46:17.913 --> 01:46:19.535
How close?

01:46:19.832 --> 01:46:22.251
Ten miles, perhaps fifteen.

01:46:22.501 --> 01:46:26.421
88s I think. Our guns
falling back, retreating.

01:46:26.422 --> 01:46:27.797
When will you be finished?

01:46:27.798 --> 01:46:29.625
Half an hour.

01:46:30.092 --> 01:46:31.718
Does it matter?

01:46:31.719 --> 01:46:34.137
You can't take the
train out in daylight.

01:46:34.138 --> 01:46:36.136
The Allies could be
here before night.

01:46:36.849 --> 01:46:40.053
Possibly. But a moving
train has no chance.

01:47:04.835 --> 01:47:07.288
Colonel, get down! Get down!

01:47:57.763 --> 01:47:59.590
Why?

01:48:00.557 --> 01:48:03.431
The paint, Herren. It's a signal.

01:48:03.519 --> 01:48:05.645
They're not going
to bomb the train.

01:48:05.646 --> 01:48:08.231
Don't scrape it off.
Leave it there.

01:48:08.232 --> 01:48:10.184
It's my ticket to Germany.

01:50:51.186 --> 01:50:52.937
After him! Search the woods!

01:50:52.938 --> 01:50:54.230
Wait!

01:50:54.773 --> 01:50:57.317
Colonel, while they
search the woods,

01:50:57.359 --> 01:50:59.735
Labiche can blow another
section of the track.

01:50:59.736 --> 01:51:01.070
And another and another.

01:51:01.071 --> 01:51:03.945
Do you suggest he will stop
if we let him run free?

01:51:04.199 --> 01:51:05.776
He could have blown up the engine.

01:51:06.201 --> 01:51:09.245
The hostages you put
aboard prevented that.

01:51:09.454 --> 01:51:12.415
I can have this repaired
in less than an hour.

01:51:12.416 --> 01:51:16.294
Keep Labiche away from the train
for the next four or five miles,

01:51:16.295 --> 01:51:19.465
till we reach Montmirail, then
we will leave him behind.

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:25.295
Labiche or the train. Which
do you want, Colonel?

01:51:59.963 --> 01:52:01.335
<i>Hier.</i>

01:52:35.958 --> 01:52:37.626
Stop!

01:53:15.038 --> 01:53:16.660
Bring over the rails!

01:53:43.525 --> 01:53:46.478
Now up! Good!

01:59:57.941 --> 01:59:59.688
Come here.

02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:08.948
I think I saw something.

02:00:59.836 --> 02:01:01.170
Stop here!

02:01:03.882 --> 02:01:06.210
I'll ride the front to Montmirail.

02:01:35.246 --> 02:01:37.869
Ten miles an hour, no more.

02:02:03.066 --> 02:02:05.268
Stop! Stop! Stop!

02:03:08.089 --> 02:03:09.791
Major!

02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:18.887
Yes, Colonel?

02:03:20.602 --> 02:03:23.100
Can we get this back on the rails?

02:03:24.314 --> 02:03:26.733
The crane is in Paris by now.

02:03:26.941 --> 02:03:29.564
Without a crane, impossible.

02:03:29.611 --> 02:03:31.779
Nothing is impossible!

02:03:32.822 --> 02:03:34.656
Get the men to work!

02:03:34.657 --> 02:03:36.734
I want this engine
back on the rails!

02:03:37.076 --> 02:03:39.828
If we had ten times as many
men it couldn't be done.

02:03:39.829 --> 02:03:41.663
I tell you it will!

02:03:41.664 --> 02:03:44.617
Do you hear me? I tell you it will!

02:03:46.085 --> 02:03:47.662
It's hopeless, Colonel.

02:04:15.365 --> 02:04:17.567
Unload those paintings!

02:04:18.034 --> 02:04:20.532
All of you, start to
unload them at once!

02:04:21.621 --> 02:04:23.323
Go on, now, Schwartz.

02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:26.083
Come on. Get to work!
Unload the crates!

02:04:26.084 --> 02:04:27.292
Stop!

02:04:27.293 --> 02:04:28.745
Come on, hurry up!

02:04:32.048 --> 02:04:33.591
Stop!

02:04:34.217 --> 02:04:37.671
Stop! Stop! Stop!

02:04:39.013 --> 02:04:41.723
- Get your men off the trucks, Lieutenant.
- Sir, we have orders...

02:04:41.724 --> 02:04:43.141
- I want those trucks.
- But, sir...

02:04:43.142 --> 02:04:45.811
I don't care about your
orders. Do as I say!

02:04:48.690 --> 02:04:50.858
Off the trucks!

02:04:51.651 --> 02:04:53.524
Off the trucks!

02:04:55.488 --> 02:04:56.735
Come on!

02:04:57.573 --> 02:04:58.774
Off the trucks!

02:05:02.537 --> 02:05:04.614
<i>Heil</i>!

02:05:04.664 --> 02:05:07.287
Move back! Back in your trucks!

02:05:07.417 --> 02:05:09.711
Back! Move back!

02:05:11.546 --> 02:05:13.380
Back in the trucks!
Back in the trucks!

02:05:13.381 --> 02:05:15.834
- What the hell's going on here?
- Him.

02:05:23.266 --> 02:05:24.891
I need your trucks,
Major. All of them.

02:05:24.892 --> 02:05:28.353
I have a cargo to deliver to
Germany. It's of vital importance.

02:05:28.354 --> 02:05:30.689
There's a French armored
division just over that hill.

02:05:30.690 --> 02:05:32.733
- What about my men?
- I don't care about your men!

02:05:32.734 --> 02:05:34.777
I order you to unload those trucks!

02:05:35.153 --> 02:05:38.232
Save your orders, Colonel.
In this sector the war is over.

02:05:38.239 --> 02:05:41.318
- Back in the trucks!
- I'll have you shot!

02:05:42.869 --> 02:05:45.037
Back in the trucks!

02:05:45.788 --> 02:05:47.865
Herren! Shoot that man!

02:05:48.082 --> 02:05:51.582
He is to be executed for
gross insubordination!

02:05:53.838 --> 02:05:56.541
Unload the trucks!

02:05:57.925 --> 02:06:00.674
Herren! I gave you an order!

02:06:00.803 --> 02:06:03.051
Move! Go! Schnell!
Schnell! Schnell!

02:06:04.307 --> 02:06:05.679
Out!

02:06:08.186 --> 02:06:10.354
We have lost, Colonel.

02:06:11.481 --> 02:06:13.183
It's hopeless.

02:06:13.608 --> 02:06:15.025
Look at those men.

02:06:15.818 --> 02:06:17.565
A defeated army.

02:06:21.783 --> 02:06:23.200
Lost, Herren?

02:06:25.953 --> 02:06:27.655
Lost?

02:06:29.791 --> 02:06:31.163
<i>Ja</i>.

02:06:35.171 --> 02:06:36.497
Come on!

02:06:39.592 --> 02:06:41.840
- You want transport?
- Thank you.

02:06:42.136 --> 02:06:45.055
- I have 50 men.
- Tell them to move fast.

02:06:45.181 --> 02:06:48.517
Schwartz! Bring the men on the
double! We are moving out!

02:06:48.518 --> 02:06:50.811
Grote, get the men in the
trucks. We are moving out.

02:06:50.812 --> 02:06:53.606
All of you get in the
trucks! In the trucks!

02:06:54.649 --> 02:06:56.858
Drop the paintings and
get in the trucks!

02:06:56.859 --> 02:06:58.402
Gunther!

02:07:10.414 --> 02:07:12.040
Stop.

02:07:12.041 --> 02:07:13.584
Colonel.

02:07:17.547 --> 02:07:19.294
You go on, Herren.

02:07:19.507 --> 02:07:21.755
There is nothing to
stay for, Colonel.

02:07:23.052 --> 02:07:25.175
You're a good officer, Herren.

02:07:28.766 --> 02:07:31.515
I'll be along in a few minutes.

02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:34.097
There'll be other trucks.

02:09:39.146 --> 02:09:41.314
Labiche!

02:09:43.401 --> 02:09:45.274
Here's your prize, Labiche.

02:09:46.988 --> 02:09:49.907
Some of the greatest
paintings in the world.

02:09:55.705 --> 02:09:57.077
Does it please you, Labiche?

02:09:59.834 --> 02:10:03.004
Do you feel a sense of excitement
in just being near them?

02:10:05.172 --> 02:10:09.593
A painting means as much to you
as a string of pearls to an ape.

02:10:11.721 --> 02:10:13.889
You won by sheer luck.

02:10:14.682 --> 02:10:18.682
You stopped me without knowing
what you were doing, or why.

02:10:20.438 --> 02:10:22.686
You are nothing, Labiche.

02:10:24.150 --> 02:10:26.273
A lump of flesh.

02:10:27.570 --> 02:10:29.612
The paintings are mine.

02:10:29.613 --> 02:10:31.736
They always will be.

02:10:32.366 --> 02:10:35.945
Beauty belongs to the man
who can appreciate it.

02:10:36.078 --> 02:10:39.248
They will always belong to
me or to a man like me.

02:10:44.295 --> 02:10:47.339
Now, this minute,

02:10:49.091 --> 02:10:52.636
you couldn't tell me why
you did what you did.

02:10:53.305 --> 02:10:59.826
