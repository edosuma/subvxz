(INTENSE MUSIC)

00:22.921 --> 00:25.521
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to The FringeFacts.com,

00:25.523 --> 00:27.424
I'm Michael Stone and
I'm just gonna go ahead

00:27.426 --> 00:28.925
and jump right in to here.

00:28.927 --> 00:31.395
Now I'm sure you've heard
about some of the chaos

00:31.397 --> 00:34.200
that went down in Madison last
month.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.533
The police incident that
spurred multiple protests

00:37.535 --> 00:40.503
intensifying over the next
passing days

00:40.505 --> 00:42.973
culminating in that
faithful night on June 8th

00:42.975 --> 00:47.443
but you haven't heard the
entire story have you?

00:47.445 --> 00:51.982
Because until now, the entire
story hasn't been visible.

00:51.984 --> 00:56.753
The events of June 8th were
an enormous provocateur

00:56.755 --> 01:00.890
staged attack on the people
of Madison implemented

01:00.892 --> 01:04.363
by major institutions
within our own very system.

01:05.396 --> 01:08.298
And we here at The
FringeFacts.com have been thrust

01:08.300 --> 01:11.635
right into the middle of this
story

01:11.637 --> 01:14.870
that the mainstream media
outlets have published is so

01:14.872 --> 01:19.913
misinformed and so full of
propaganda, disgusting, truly.

01:22.947 --> 01:25.983
But thanks to the outstanding
and diligent effort

01:25.985 --> 01:28.951
of my field reporter Tessa
Monroe,

01:28.953 --> 01:32.489
we have in our possession,
first hand account

01:32.491 --> 01:34.827
of that night and what actually
happened.

01:36.428 --> 01:41.434
Now, to reiterate, at every
branch, at every level

01:44.270 --> 01:49.373
within this machine, they do
not want this video circulating

01:49.375 --> 01:52.808
at every level, they got
something to hide

01:52.810 --> 01:54.578
and at every level, they
are doing their best

01:54.580 --> 01:57.881
to prevent you from seeing
what is truly going on.

01:57.883 --> 02:02.352
But tonight, you're gonna
have a chance to see the truth

02:02.354 --> 02:03.756
and forge your own opinion.

02:05.291 --> 02:10.294
Now, be aware, some of
this footage is violent

02:13.331 --> 02:18.337
and very disturbing, viewer
discretion is advised,

02:20.606 --> 02:25.612
so put the kids to bed, dim the
lights

02:26.811 --> 02:29.412
and get ready for this
never before seen footage

02:29.414 --> 02:31.950
of these events from Madison.

02:34.787 --> 02:37.523
(WATER RUSHING)

02:40.793 --> 02:43.696
ASH: Hey Mark, check this
out.

02:46.497 --> 02:51.503
Mark, look there's like these
icicles, they're enormous.

02:55.441 --> 02:57.673
Hey, how old do you think this
is?

02:57.675 --> 03:01.644
MARK: Wait what?
I can't hear you.

03:01.646 --> 03:02.979
- ASH: Mark
- The signals really bad,

03:02.981 --> 03:04.780
- you're going in and...
- ASH: Jeez.

03:04.782 --> 03:09.785
Steph?
Stephanie, Stephanie.

03:09.787 --> 03:13.292
- Mark, get off your phone.
- What?

03:14.660 --> 03:16.829
What year do you think
this became a park?

03:17.930 --> 03:22.565
I don't know, what do I
look like Indiana Jones?

03:22.567 --> 03:23.899
(LAUGHING)

03:23.901 --> 03:27.339
Hey, he was an
archeologist, not a geologist.

03:28.874 --> 03:31.708
Whatever, when did you get so
interested

03:31.710 --> 03:34.710
- in all of this anyway?
- Since forever.

03:34.712 --> 03:38.849
Wow, thanks for noticing
the past two decades.

03:38.851 --> 03:41.650
Well poor little baby brother
didn't get enough attention.

03:41.652 --> 03:43.489
Stop, stop.

03:44.889 --> 03:48.727
Seriously though dude, if
I was half as smart as you,

03:49.595 --> 03:52.161
(GRUNTS) I'd start looking into
something

03:52.163 --> 03:54.930
a little more beneficial,
you know what I mean?

03:54.932 --> 03:58.934
- Such as?
- I don't know,

03:58.936 --> 04:03.942
a doctor, scientist, a
lawyer because something man.

04:09.481 --> 04:11.614
Well, I'm still young, you
know,

04:11.616 --> 04:14.453
I have a shot at it unlike some
people.

04:16.422 --> 04:19.154
- So now I'm the old fart?
- Just saying.

04:19.156 --> 04:22.561
Dude, look don't worry about
me alright?

04:23.628 --> 04:26.463
Once my business idea takes
off, the whole family's

04:26.465 --> 04:29.568
not gonna have to worry
about anything every again.

04:30.469 --> 04:32.169
Steph and I are getting married.

04:32.171 --> 04:35.838
Married, to your
girlfriend of nine months?

04:35.840 --> 04:38.908
- A year, alright?
- Uh huh.

04:38.910 --> 04:41.146
We get mom and dad a nice
house,

04:42.013 --> 04:47.018
some cool cars, you can
live in my basement.

04:47.719 --> 04:49.186
I am not living in a basement.

04:49.188 --> 04:52.021
Whoa, dude, dude it's
gonna be the nicest basement

04:52.023 --> 04:55.792
you've ever seen, really,
I mean a pool table,

04:55.794 --> 04:59.528
fuse ball, cute little race car
bed.

04:59.530 --> 05:03.402
(LAUGHING) race care bed,
great thanks.

05:12.677 --> 05:16.112
But actually, that's one of
the reasons

05:16.114 --> 05:20.917
- I wanted to take this trip.
- For a race car bed?

05:20.919 --> 05:25.855
No dude seriously, I mean my
business.

05:25.857 --> 05:29.828
I know we've talked
about it and mom and dad

05:31.128 --> 05:33.896
and I know that you're
not thrilled with it.

05:33.898 --> 05:38.804
- Wait you asked them?
- They offered.

05:40.605 --> 05:45.610
- You said no right?
- No.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.177
How can you be so selfish,
Mark?

05:48.179 --> 05:50.780
- I'm not being selfish.
- Yes you are,

05:50.782 --> 05:52.047
you're being selfish.

05:52.049 --> 05:53.249
How is that being selfish?

05:53.251 --> 05:54.818
They don't have the money for
it.

05:54.820 --> 05:57.254
- Money's not the issue.
- Yes it is the issue.

05:57.256 --> 05:59.758
If it was an issue they
wouldn't have offered.

06:00.725 --> 06:01.958
You're just doing this for
you.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.828
I'm not doing it just for
me, I'm doing it for all of us

06:04.830 --> 06:07.030
- because Steph said that
- No it doesn't matter

06:07.032 --> 06:09.101
what Steph said, she's not
family.

06:18.210 --> 06:21.813
Forgot your camera.
(INTENSE MUSIC)

06:28.720 --> 06:29.919
Okay here it goes.

06:29.921 --> 06:33.590
Alright Ash, I know that you
don't like birthday presents

06:33.592 --> 06:35.658
and I know you also hate being
on camera

06:35.660 --> 06:38.627
but I promise this is
strictly for personal use.

06:38.629 --> 06:41.533
I swear I will not put this on
my channel

06:42.301 --> 06:44.737
unless, of course, I say
something funny.

06:47.672 --> 06:49.306
(DOOR KNOCKING)

06:49.308 --> 06:51.040
Oh and also I borrowed your SD
card,

06:51.042 --> 06:55.614
I hope that's not a problem.
Hey, there he is, hey!

06:57.015 --> 06:59.583
No I get it Donny, but
seriously I'll open it

06:59.585 --> 07:02.852
but not everything has to go
on your stupid channel okay?

07:02.854 --> 07:05.287
DONNY: What, c'mon man, can't
I film

07:05.289 --> 07:07.290
my best friend opening
his birthday present

07:07.292 --> 07:09.359
without being accused
of trying to get views?

07:09.361 --> 07:13.763
Dude just open it up, I
think you're gonna like it.

07:13.765 --> 07:16.568
(PAPER RUSTLING)

07:21.039 --> 07:24.139

It's a new head mountain
1080P POV camera man!

07:27.612 --> 07:32.617
Yeah, it is, yeah, I love it
man, yeah, just what I wanted

07:35.886 --> 07:39.858
You hate it.
Oh my god, I knew it.

07:40.792 --> 07:42.958
That was just stupid, stupid me,

07:42.960 --> 07:45.194
I was just wanted to get a
camera

07:45.196 --> 07:46.896
and I thought we could
make videos together

07:46.898 --> 07:50.333
like we used to but you know
what I still have the receipt,

07:50.335 --> 07:52.167
we can just return it, I'll take
it back.

07:52.169 --> 07:55.338
No Donny, Donny, seriously
it's cool I like it.

07:55.340 --> 07:57.206
- You sure?
- Yeah man, it's awesome

07:57.208 --> 07:58.874
I can't wait to try it out.

07:58.876 --> 08:02.211
Alright then, let's
get this bad boy opened.

08:02.213 --> 08:03.078
ASH: I didn't mean right now.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.179
Here take the camera.

08:04.181 --> 08:06.415
Guys, Donny D coming at you
live with a new unboxing

08:06.417 --> 08:07.751
and tech review today.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.819
ASH: Donny, seriously?
No

08:09.821 --> 08:11.321
We have an amazing, we have an
amazing.

08:11.323 --> 08:13.155
It doesn't look terrible.

08:13.157 --> 08:14.924
I'm glad you're enjoying this.

08:14.926 --> 08:17.259
No dude I'm serious, look.
(CAMERA SHUTTERS)

08:17.261 --> 08:20.830
See, it's cool on, you look
like you're from the future.

08:20.832 --> 08:22.766
Alright look, I'll
wear it today but only

08:22.768 --> 08:26.903
because it'll make for some
cool home video or whatever.

08:26.905 --> 08:28.071
Understood, completely
understood.

08:28.073 --> 08:31.644
Purely for family-oriented
documentation purposes only.

08:32.376 --> 08:35.943
- But we better get going.
- We still have time.

08:35.946 --> 08:37.212
Dude, it's almost three.

08:37.215 --> 08:39.149
Well why are you in such a
hurry?

08:39.150 --> 08:41.082
Why aren't you?
Mark is your brother

08:41.085 --> 08:44.154
and you guys haven't seen
each other in forever.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.256
Yeah, there's a reason for
that.

08:46.258 --> 08:48.992
Look dude, all I'm saying
is if I had a brother

08:48.994 --> 08:51.261
and then for whatever
reason we quit talking

08:51.263 --> 08:53.429
and then years down the
road I had the opportunity

08:53.431 --> 08:56.900
to be the bigger man, I would
take it.

08:56.902 --> 08:58.767
Life's too short to hold
grudges.

08:58.769 --> 09:00.005
It's not a grudge man.

09:01.473 --> 09:03.238
Mark and I's relationship
it's not like you

09:03.240 --> 09:05.311
and your imaginary brother,
okay?

09:06.811 --> 09:08.477
What happened between
him and my family and me,

09:08.479 --> 09:12.448
it's in the past but
forgive me if I'm reluctant

09:12.450 --> 09:14.918
to take a trip down memory
lane even if it is my birthday.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.753
I'm not trying to tell you
what to do.

09:17.755 --> 09:18.722
That's alright man, I was just

09:18.724 --> 09:19.988
a little wound up that's all.

09:19.990 --> 09:22.092
Just relax okay?
It'll be fine.

09:22.094 --> 09:24.093
I'll be there, Mark's wife will
be there.

09:24.095 --> 09:25.995
- Fiance.
- Well whatever.

09:25.997 --> 09:27.830
- Are you cool?
- Yeah, yeah,

09:27.832 --> 09:28.733
I'm gonna be fine.

09:30.969 --> 09:33.269
And you're wrong, you do have a
brother.

09:33.271 --> 09:34.707
Alright, I'm your brother.

09:36.441 --> 09:39.011
DONNY: Wow, that was kind of
weird man.

09:39.978 --> 09:41.276
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
I know where I've seen

09:41.278 --> 09:42.911
that before, where I've heard
that.

09:42.913 --> 09:47.919
Donny, Donny, I am your brother
(GRUNTING)

09:49.787 --> 09:51.788
- Where are my keys?
- DONNY: Brother.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.923
Seriously, where are my keys?

09:53.925 --> 09:57.128
DONNY: I have no
idea, I don't live here.

09:58.797 --> 10:02.397
- And there, wait hold on, no
- ASH: Stop.

10:02.399 --> 10:05.234
I got it Ash, stop leave it
alone.

10:05.236 --> 10:07.203
ASH: Why do you need
to have it on right now?

10:07.205 --> 10:10.376
Dude, we're gonna
wanna film this, come on.

10:12.143 --> 10:16.246
TESSA: Residents of Madison,
when will we be silenced?

10:16.248 --> 10:17.413
GROUP: Never!

10:17.415 --> 10:18.348
TESSA: When will we

10:18.350 --> 10:19.216
GROUP: Never!

10:19.218 --> 10:19.915
Dude it's that chick from the

10:19.917 --> 10:20.851
TESSA: When shall we be free?

10:20.853 --> 10:21.818

- Ash: What's she doing?

10:21.820 --> 10:25.789
GIRL: Take back your
country, follow me!

10:25.791 --> 10:27.056
- (GROUP CHEERING)
- Donny: I wish could.

10:27.058 --> 10:28.125
- ASH: Let's get outta here.
- DONNY: Do you have any idea

10:28.127 --> 10:30.796
how cool it would be if I
had a channel like that?

10:32.096 --> 10:33.163
STEPH: Now say it again.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.998
Oh come on, what're
you doing, turn that off.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.071
- STEPH: Say it!
- I'm not gonna say it.

10:41.038 --> 10:44.573
- You look nice.
- STEPH: Nice?

10:44.575 --> 10:46.508
You say it again or I will
make a huge scene right here.

10:46.510 --> 10:50.213
You heard me, come on
what more do you want?

10:50.215 --> 10:52.218
- STEPH: Marcus Whitmore!
- Shh, shh!

10:54.485 --> 10:57.523
- What do you want from me?
- STEPH: Say it.

11:01.292 --> 11:06.297
Okay, okay, Stephanie, you're
the most

11:07.364 --> 11:10.436
gorgeous fiance a man could ever
ask for.

11:11.936 --> 11:14.840
I'm the luckiest guy in the
world to have you in my life.

11:16.374 --> 11:17.509
You're my one and only.

11:20.545 --> 11:25.551
- And?
- And I'm your Marcusaurus.

11:26.450 --> 11:29.888
- My what?
- You heard me, come on.

11:32.056 --> 11:35.193
- I want you to yell it.
- I'm not gonna yell it.

11:36.094 --> 11:38.428
STEPH: I will post
this all over your wall

11:38.430 --> 11:41.130
and your friends will see
just how macho you really are.

11:41.132 --> 11:45.300
I'm you're Marcusaurus Rex!
(LAUGHING)

11:45.302 --> 11:47.904
STEPH: See, when's your
brother supposed to be here?

11:47.906 --> 11:50.205
Soon I guess.

11:50.207 --> 11:52.574
Dude, all I'm saying is
if I had that many viewers

11:52.576 --> 11:54.010
I would have sponsors lining up

11:54.012 --> 11:55.310
around the block to give me
money.

11:55.312 --> 11:56.979
ASH: Yeah Donny, I get it but
would you

11:56.981 --> 11:58.314
really wanna stoop that low?

11:58.316 --> 12:02.484
- (LAUGHING)
- Wait you're serious?

12:02.486 --> 12:04.856
- ASH: Yeah.
- Did you hear that?

12:06.590 --> 12:09.291
ASH: What the heck are you
doing man?

12:09.293 --> 12:11.526
It's that woman from the news.

12:11.528 --> 12:13.262
Man she really knows her stuff.

12:13.264 --> 12:15.397
Hey, what're you doing in my
garage kid?

12:15.399 --> 12:17.099
DONNY: Sorry man I was
just checking out your radio

12:17.101 --> 12:18.101
Yeah beat feet, get outta
here, out.

12:18.103 --> 12:18.801
- ASH: Sorry.
- DONNY: We're just listening

12:18.803 --> 12:20.370
- Out, bye.
- DONNY: Okay.

12:20.372 --> 12:21.905
- Bye, bye
- ASH: My friend's crazy.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.238
DONNY: Alright,
we're going, we're gone.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.607
ASH: Are you nuts man?
What is this?

12:25.609 --> 12:27.879
A mechanic shop in Nazi
Germany.

12:29.681 --> 12:34.284
STEPH: They're here,
Ash is here, be nice.

12:34.286 --> 12:36.255
You really think you
should be filming this?

12:38.223 --> 12:40.189
- Hey Ash.
- Hey,

12:40.191 --> 12:42.157
it's good to see you again.

12:42.159 --> 12:43.628
Happy birthday little brother.

12:45.596 --> 12:47.566
Mark, how are you doing?

12:48.600 --> 12:50.433
- What's this?
- That my friend

12:50.435 --> 12:53.272
- is a brand spanking new 1080P
- It's a gift.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.271
- You must be Donny.
- Yeah, what's up Mark?

12:56.273 --> 12:57.272
How you doing?

12:57.274 --> 12:58.540
MARK: Heard a lot of
good things about you.

12:58.542 --> 13:02.344
Yeah, I've heard a lot of, you
too.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.647
Hey Ash, I'm sorry I
wanted to get you something

13:05.649 --> 13:07.482
but with the wedding and
everything.

13:07.484 --> 13:10.687
- It's fine.
- Money's just tight right now

13:10.689 --> 13:13.559
- It's okay, really.
- Where's mom and dad?

13:15.326 --> 13:17.462
They're out of town
visiting Aunt Sherri.

13:18.529 --> 13:19.562
They didn't know I was coming?

13:19.564 --> 13:21.229
Well with work and everything

13:21.231 --> 13:22.901
it just must've slipped my mind.

13:26.437 --> 13:29.604
Hey, does anybody want
some birthday muffins?

13:29.606 --> 13:32.208
Yes, that is great, I could
definitely

13:32.210 --> 13:34.209
go for some muffins right now.

13:34.211 --> 13:35.246
When in Rome.

13:41.186 --> 13:44.422
So Donny, what do you do?

13:45.356 --> 13:49.257
Well I am an internet
celebrity.

13:49.259 --> 13:51.461
- Oh really?
- He wishes.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.596
So you make like videos and
stuff?

13:53.598 --> 13:57.065
- Yeah, mostly tech related.
- You get paid for that right?

13:57.067 --> 13:59.168
I mean how is that even work?

13:59.170 --> 14:01.471
Well usually big sponsors
will pay you to run ads

14:01.473 --> 14:03.072
and promote them on your
channel.

14:03.074 --> 14:05.341
Oh, so you can actually
make pretty good money then?

14:05.343 --> 14:08.711
Well, yeah theoretically
but it's a little bit

14:08.713 --> 14:09.846
of a work in progress.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.580
You gotta get a big audience,
get a lot of viewers,

14:11.582 --> 14:13.348
that sort of thing.

14:13.350 --> 14:15.650
Everything is potentially
public domain with Donny.

14:15.652 --> 14:17.520
- DONNY: Really?
- If he thinks

14:17.522 --> 14:19.425
it'll get him views, he'll
record it.

14:20.657 --> 14:22.091
So you're saying, even I'm not
safe?

14:22.093 --> 14:24.359
ASH: No, you are most
definitely not safe.

14:24.361 --> 14:25.495
What, come on dude.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.195
You can give me a little bit of
credit.

14:27.197 --> 14:28.967
- (LAUGHING)
- Ash: No one's safe.

14:32.103 --> 14:35.407
So Ash, you still
thinking about law school?

14:36.673 --> 14:39.409
No as it turns out I can't
afford it.

14:39.411 --> 14:41.309
I know that feeling,
Mark's business closed

14:41.311 --> 14:43.612
two years ago and we're
still feeling the pinch.

14:43.614 --> 14:45.280
Can't afford our dream wedding.

14:45.282 --> 14:48.617
- Steph, let's not.
- STEPH: What?

14:48.619 --> 14:50.218
Mark, you're an entrepreneur.

14:50.220 --> 14:51.286
Your first business didn't work
out,

14:51.288 --> 14:54.424
it's not a big deal
everyone came out unharmed.

14:54.426 --> 14:55.694
- Stephanie.
- What?

14:56.860 --> 14:59.295
Yeah, what's wrong Mark?
Everyone came out unharmed.

14:59.297 --> 15:00.796
She didn't know, alright
let's just drop it okay?

15:00.798 --> 15:03.366
- Didn't know what?
- Nothing, okay?

15:03.368 --> 15:04.467
We'll talk about it later.

15:04.469 --> 15:06.102
ASH: No let's talk
about it now, you tell her.

15:06.104 --> 15:07.636
- DONNY: Just cool it, man.
- Tell me what?

15:07.638 --> 15:09.204
You really wanna do this here?

15:09.206 --> 15:12.074
- Mark.
- ASH: Oh, he's just bein shy

15:12.076 --> 15:13.775
Guess he never told you
how he was able to afford

15:13.777 --> 15:15.243
to open that business, right?

15:15.245 --> 15:16.312
Ash let's just step
outside for a second.

15:16.314 --> 15:18.613
Must've never shared
the fact that his parents

15:18.615 --> 15:21.416
invested their retirement and
put up their house for a loan

15:21.418 --> 15:24.420
and all because of his willingness
to gamble their security

15:24.422 --> 15:26.389
with his ignorance in running a
business,

15:26.391 --> 15:28.458
- they lost everything.
- You watch your mouth.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.525
ASH: Or what, Mark?

15:29.527 --> 15:30.727
What else you gonna try
and take away from me huh?

15:30.729 --> 15:34.097
After you bankrupted mom and
dad and left for two years,

15:34.099 --> 15:36.165
I was left to pick up the
pieces.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.733
I gave up my dreams, my life
goals,

15:38.735 --> 15:40.736
all so I could get a
nine to five to help pay

15:40.738 --> 15:42.671
for mom and dad's one
bedroom apartment on 6th.

15:42.673 --> 15:46.108
- We're leaving.
- Oh, what a surprise!

15:46.110 --> 15:47.642
Mark, you're running away again.

15:47.644 --> 15:49.344
Don't worry about paying for the
coffee,

15:49.346 --> 15:50.445
I'm used to bailing you out.

15:50.447 --> 15:53.248
- You know what, you little
- No you listen to me.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.450
Just tell the truth, Mark.

15:55.452 --> 15:56.618
You didn't come back for my
birthday,

15:56.620 --> 15:59.222
you haven't been to one of
my birthdays since I was 12.

15:59.224 --> 16:01.390
You need mommy and daddy again.

16:01.392 --> 16:02.891
What is it, another half baked
scheme,

16:02.893 --> 16:05.129
another get rich quick scam?

16:07.398 --> 16:10.134
Oh, you need money for that
dream wedding don't you?

16:12.137 --> 16:13.301
Oh, that's great, we wouldn't
want you

16:13.303 --> 16:15.473
to miss out on any of the fancy
amenities.

16:20.311 --> 16:22.277
(DOOR BELL RINGING)

16:22.279 --> 16:26.117
Is that true?
Mark?

16:26.817 --> 16:28.284
DONNY: Yeah, I think that's
about...

16:28.286 --> 16:29.785
- Donny.
- Go.

16:29.787 --> 16:31.887
Okay, jeez just trying to
help.

16:31.889 --> 16:33.789
Sorry for the disturbance
people.

16:33.791 --> 16:36.626
Go back to your coffees,
nothing to see here.

16:36.628 --> 16:39.362
Hey Ash, wait up man.

16:39.364 --> 16:40.695
- Not now Donny.
- DONNY: Look,

16:40.697 --> 16:42.497
maybe just calm down a little
bit?

16:42.499 --> 16:45.136
You seriously gonna tell
me to calm down right now?

16:45.903 --> 16:49.438
Alright, you're right my bad
I'm sorry.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.707
It's just, look at it this way
man,

16:51.709 --> 16:55.747
it's good to get all your
feelings out in the open.

16:56.781 --> 17:00.719
Feel any better?
Come on, how do you feel?

17:02.420 --> 17:04.787
- A little better actually.
- DONNY: See, I told you.

17:04.789 --> 17:06.825
It's soul cleansing, it's
cathartic.

17:07.958 --> 17:12.861
- Look I'll be fine, alright?
- Alright, good.

17:12.863 --> 17:14.896
Well, they're definitely not
gonna let us back in there

17:14.897 --> 17:17.232
but I'll go grab the other
two and tell them that

- Yeah, Donny?

ever hear anything like that?

17:32.984 --> 17:33.950
Never.

makes a noise like that?

I don't know but we
gotta get outta here.

hear anything right now.

you guys see anything?

- Sorry.

know?

not like I spend a whole lot

does a small town like this
even have all that gear?

to be protocol right?

guys, they know what's legal,

trying to get the bad guys

I do know this is the biggest,

most blatant crack down ever

to your social media pages.

- It's one of those documents

dictates

22:03.888 --> 22:06.555
I wouldn't feel safer with
either.

22:06.557 --> 22:10.225
I'm sorry Erin, Erin, just
pause this for a second, okay?

22:10.227 --> 22:12.627
Sorry folks, but I didn't
wanna bite my tongue

22:12.629 --> 22:14.930
for too much longer and
miss the opportunity

22:14.932 --> 22:18.166
to add in some new information
we recently gathered.

22:18.168 --> 22:20.202
For the past few months,
we've been reporting

22:20.204 --> 22:23.271
that there were drills taking
place weeks before the events

22:23.273 --> 22:27.609
of June 8th and just now,
the corporate news outlets

22:27.611 --> 22:28.779
are reporting the same.

22:30.214 --> 22:34.015
The Dispatch: Routine Crowd
Control Drills

22:34.017 --> 22:36.719
take place in Madison Last May.

22:36.721 --> 22:39.655
I mean, there were events
taken place, drills taken place

22:39.657 --> 22:44.527
in Madison weeks before
those incidents broke out

22:44.529 --> 22:46.064
and that's from the press okay?

22:47.098 --> 22:49.697
They were training how to
handle a city wide event

22:49.699 --> 22:52.134
like the one that happened
and how to prepare

22:52.136 --> 22:55.303
for a Marshall law type
atmosphere

22:55.305 --> 22:58.107
but their denials of that?

22:58.109 --> 23:01.480
I mean, that just shows that
they got something to hide.

23:02.980 --> 23:06.147
This is big folks, this is real
big

23:06.149 --> 23:09.952
and we here at The FringeFacts.com
are in grave danger,

23:09.954 --> 23:12.620
I mean this is the most
we have ever been in

23:12.622 --> 23:15.624
because we are following
this trail and it is hot.

23:15.626 --> 23:20.632
Folks, it is red hot but we
have a lot more information

23:22.632 --> 23:25.134
and a very special guest star
in our studio in a little bit

23:25.136 --> 23:29.938
so let's get back to the
footage, Erin go ahead.

23:29.940 --> 23:30.808
Roll it again.

23:32.142 --> 23:34.209
DONNY: So tell me
again, why we're walking?

23:34.211 --> 23:36.645
Because your girlfriend
wants to keep a low profile.

23:36.647 --> 23:38.146
- (LAUGHING)
- Donny: Girlfriend.

23:38.148 --> 23:39.615
Please, I just happen to respect

23:39.617 --> 23:41.051
a fellow journalist that's all.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.719
- Yeah.
- DONNY: Why,

23:43.721 --> 23:45.156
did she say something about me?

23:47.058 --> 23:48.357
Where is everybody?

23:48.359 --> 23:51.225
Yeah, probably at
home where we should be.

23:51.227 --> 23:52.828
(BICKERING)

23:52.830 --> 23:55.063
Why can't you just
listen to me for once?

23:55.065 --> 23:56.764
DONNY: Think they'll ever
stop arguing?

23:56.766 --> 23:59.169
Yeah, not as long as
they are both breathing.

24:00.170 --> 24:01.971
DONNY: Yeah, hey Ash.

24:01.973 --> 24:03.806
MARK: Okay, I'm not
saying we need to trust her

24:03.808 --> 24:05.674
but we can use her to help
us get out of Madison.

24:05.676 --> 24:07.943
ASH: We can find a way out
of our own town ourselves.

24:07.945 --> 24:09.211
Yeah, and we might find
ourselves

24:09.213 --> 24:10.111
in the middle of another war
again.

24:10.113 --> 24:12.080
Alright, she can help us get
outta here

24:12.082 --> 24:13.214
without finding anymore trouble.

24:13.216 --> 24:15.117
For all we know, she is the
trouble.

24:15.119 --> 24:16.851
Ash, look I think Mark's right
man.

24:16.853 --> 24:18.921
- Stay out of this Donny.
- Dude, what's your deal?

24:18.923 --> 24:21.790
Alright, you hate me.
Alright, I get that.

24:21.792 --> 24:22.991
But you're so wrapped up in it

24:22.993 --> 24:25.394
that you'd really put everyone
here in danger, for what?

24:25.396 --> 24:26.729
To prove you don't need your big
brother

24:26.731 --> 24:27.730
looking over your shoulder?

24:27.732 --> 24:28.598
Oh you think you know
everything don't you?

24:28.600 --> 24:31.000
Oh my god, why are you here
then?

24:31.002 --> 24:33.636
Huh, you're a big boy, why
don't you just go home?

24:33.638 --> 24:34.703
You know what, maybe I will.

24:34.705 --> 24:35.637
Okay, come on guys.

24:35.639 --> 24:36.704

complaining.

Oh, I'll send you a
postcard from mom and dads.

24:42.279 --> 24:43.145
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah,

24:43.147 --> 24:44.780

horse

24:44.782 --> 24:45.914

24:45.916 --> 24:47.081

24:47.083 --> 24:49.018
I'm not gonna listen to this
the whole way there, okay?

we will turn around right now

24:51.388 --> 24:52.924

young to be out proesting?

going on?

25:56.486 --> 25:58.953

thing.

31:34.291 --> 31:37.291
That's cool, so you knew all
about those LRADs then today,

31:37.293 --> 31:38.726
that didn't surprise you at all.

31:38.728 --> 31:39.761

31:39.763 --> 31:42.196
The long range acoustic
devices, the LRADs.

31:42.198 --> 31:45.800

Yeah those LRADs.

31:45.802 --> 31:47.301
Yeah that's crazy right?

31:47.303 --> 31:48.604
I never heard anything like that
before.

31:48.606 --> 31:52.206
Well except for when I researched
it to find out what it was

31:52.208 --> 31:54.309
but yeah I tried to warn the
other guys,

31:54.311 --> 31:55.810
but they wouldn't listen.

followers?

you more about your research

32:13.429 --> 32:16.431
in the government tech
developments so tell me

32:16.433 --> 32:21.168
what you know about CTGWs,
HD's, militarized max.

32:21.170 --> 32:25.240
Militarized max, CT, yeah
well the last time I researched

32:25.242 --> 32:30.248
it and looked into it, what
I found was, hey, what?

32:30.880 --> 32:33.682
What'd you say?
You called me.

32:33.684 --> 32:35.817
- You need me over there?
- ASH: No?

32:35.819 --> 32:37.452

anything.

32:38.821 --> 32:40.789

time,

32:40.791 --> 32:43.258

does

32:43.260 --> 32:47.098
but we should probably go
checkout what he wants, come on.

32:47.865 --> 32:49.798
Rain check on the whole
interview thing okay?

32:49.800 --> 32:50.866
TESSA: Okay?

32:50.868 --> 32:53.171
Can you please talk some
sense into your friend?

32:54.271 --> 32:55.270
Why, what's going on?

32:55.272 --> 32:57.472
He wants to go to the
police station and quote

32:57.474 --> 33:00.207
"demand the release of
Mark and Becca's mom."

33:00.209 --> 33:01.842
What?
Ash are you crazy?

33:01.844 --> 33:03.377
No, I'm not crazy okay?

33:03.379 --> 33:05.280
This is me logically trying
to solve a problem okay?

33:05.282 --> 33:06.848
No, if you go to the police
station,

33:06.850 --> 33:09.584
the only thing that will happen
is you will get arrested too

33:09.586 --> 33:12.453
- Dude, she's right.
- Tessa,

33:12.455 --> 33:14.289
you said cameras fight tyranny,
right?

33:14.291 --> 33:17.291
So we go down there, we
show them the footage,

33:17.293 --> 33:19.362
and we show the captain what
their psycho,

33:20.531 --> 33:22.563
we show the captain what those
psychos did

33:22.565 --> 33:23.865
and we get justice.

33:23.867 --> 33:26.167
No we get a lawyer to get
justice.

33:26.169 --> 33:28.403
Justice only happens
when those who are intact

33:28.405 --> 33:30.475
are as indignant as those who
are injured.

33:32.842 --> 33:34.276
What?

33:34.278 --> 33:35.844
Look, what I'm saying
is we can't expect help

33:35.846 --> 33:37.646
from anyone who doesn't
believe what's going on here

33:37.648 --> 33:39.848
is wrong in the first place
and I really don't think

33:39.850 --> 33:42.184
the cops understand that
what they're doing is wrong.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.386
Wait so we do nothing, that's
your plan?

33:44.388 --> 33:45.553
No, I'm saying the opposite.

33:45.555 --> 33:47.454
We have to act now and fast,

33:47.456 --> 33:50.791
but going to the police
for help, that's pointless.

33:50.793 --> 33:53.228
Okay Ash, Mark would not
want this, you know that.

33:53.230 --> 33:54.195
- Mark's not here right now.
- Yeah

33:54.197 --> 33:56.798
and you won't be either
if you go with her.

33:56.800 --> 33:57.898
Okay, you had the right idea
earlier,

33:57.900 --> 33:59.967
we never should've gone
with her in the first place.

33:59.969 --> 34:01.203
Yeah, well now we need her.

34:01.205 --> 34:01.906
- No Ash!
- Guys!

34:04.942 --> 34:07.309
My phone's not working.

34:07.311 --> 34:09.679
Let me see.
(BEEPING)

34:16.252 --> 34:20.288
All the channels are out.
Whoa, what was that?

34:20.290 --> 34:22.724
- TESSA: The phones are out.
- Wait,

34:22.726 --> 34:26.228
so there's no TV, no lights, no
service.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.962
They hit the kill switch,
they're

34:27.964 --> 34:30.297
cutting us off from the
rest of the country.

34:30.299 --> 34:31.498
Why?

34:31.500 --> 34:33.768
So that they can control
what information is released.

34:33.770 --> 34:36.938
- No, we need to go.
- Go where?

34:36.940 --> 34:39.407
I'm not leaving without my mom.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.875
There's no where to go, it's
too late

34:41.877 --> 34:43.378
we're not getting out of town
now.

34:43.380 --> 34:44.282
Okay, I'm going.

34:50.953 --> 34:52.920
- What's her deal?
- DONNY: I don't know,

34:52.922 --> 34:54.088
she's just upset okay?

34:54.090 --> 34:56.991
ASH: Look, I'm sorry, I
am, you were right, alright?

34:56.993 --> 34:59.027
We should've just went
back to my apartment

34:59.029 --> 35:01.730
after the coffee shop but you
saw what they did alright?

35:01.732 --> 35:03.965
We can't just sit back
and do nothing, alright?

35:03.967 --> 35:04.799
He's my brother.

35:04.801 --> 35:05.733
What do you think Mark would
say,

35:05.735 --> 35:06.967
if he knew what you were doing
right now?

35:06.969 --> 35:10.038
Well I don't know but I don't
need yours or his permission

35:10.040 --> 35:10.905
I'm doing this.

35:10.907 --> 35:12.040
Okay, I love Mark just as much
as you.

35:12.042 --> 35:14.409
- See that's the problem.
- What, that I love Mark?

35:14.411 --> 35:16.744
No that you love Mark
and he knows you do.

35:16.746 --> 35:18.846
Come on Ash, Mark knows you
love him

35:18.848 --> 35:20.782
and you know he'd do
anything to keep you safe.

35:20.784 --> 35:22.317
Well now I get to return the
favor.

35:22.319 --> 35:25.387
No, no okay, Mark can
still walk out of this okay,

35:25.389 --> 35:27.788
but that doesn't happen if
you end up in prison or jail

35:27.790 --> 35:29.824
okay that's not a happy ending.

35:29.826 --> 35:31.826
Your brother isn't at the
police station

35:31.828 --> 35:33.628
but if you wanna find
him, we need to hurry.

35:33.630 --> 35:34.532
- Why?
- Move.

35:43.540 --> 35:44.639
There's a good angle over there.

35:44.641 --> 35:45.806
- DONNY: Are you sure?
- TESSA: You want viewers,

35:45.808 --> 35:46.541
- right?
- DANNY: Yeah.

35:46.543 --> 35:48.813
- TESSA: Go.
- DONNY: Okay.

ASH: Oh god.
They can't do that.

36:19.942 --> 36:21.409
Tessa what are they doing?

36:21.411 --> 36:24.882
Looks like they're
rounding up civilians.

36:29.985 --> 36:33.056
ASH: What is going on?
Look at him.

36:38.494 --> 36:41.565

I said don't move.

using rubber bullets.

hands, show me your hands.

36:53.909 --> 36:54.775
Hands where I can see them.

36:54.777 --> 36:56.578
If they have my mom.

36:56.580 --> 36:57.712
ASH: We're gonna get you your
mom,

36:57.714 --> 36:58.947
- she's gonna be okay, alright?
- DONNY: What the hell

36:58.949 --> 37:01.148
Tessa, if Marks not at the
police station, he's probably

37:01.150 --> 37:03.150
wherever they're taking
those people right now.

37:03.152 --> 37:04.719
TESSA: I believe so.

High,

37:06.623 --> 37:08.690
High connects with Ventura
right?

37:08.692 --> 37:10.628
Uh, yeah, yeah why?

37:11.627 --> 37:15.429
If we cross the street here,
we can go down the side alley

37:15.431 --> 37:17.831
and then we can meet up with the
trunk

37:17.833 --> 37:18.967
and follow it the rest of the
way.

37:18.969 --> 37:19.900
No, if we cross now, the
soldiers are gonna see us

37:19.902 --> 37:21.802
and we'll get scraped off the
pavement.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.637
Well we don't have any other
choice.

37:23.639 --> 37:24.505
TESSA: He's right,
if we're gonna do this

37:24.507 --> 37:25.475
we have to go now.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.076
Becca, you think you can do
this?

37:29.078 --> 37:31.579
- I'll be fine.
- Alright,

ASH: You sure you
know what you're doing?

38:36.513 --> 38:37.811
You don't grow up in a
hospital

38:37.813 --> 38:40.047
without learning a few things.

38:40.049 --> 38:41.715
You need a doctor.

No, they're gonna be stationed
at the hospitals by now.

wound

be okay to keep going?

38:50.025 --> 38:51.925
What?
She's not going anywhere.

38:51.927 --> 38:53.194
- You tell me.
- Ash,

38:53.196 --> 38:54.529
if we can a car, we can get her

38:54.531 --> 38:55.864
to another hospital outside of
town.

can't risk being seen.

38:58.634 --> 38:59.333
We can't drive.

38:59.335 --> 39:00.770

- You leave me here.
- What?

DONNY: We're not leaving you
here okay?

Donny but your friends need you

39:08.978 --> 39:10.645
and I can take care of myself.

where Mark is right now.

- You're not with them?
- No.

anything,

Kurt and we're big fans.

what's going on over there?

- Power down.

you're dressing this wound,

40:42.105 --> 40:44.672
we're gonna need all hands all

40:44.674 --> 40:47.708
and if you want answers,
we don't talk on tape

40:47.710 --> 40:49.546
so power down.

40:54.317 --> 40:55.616

were

40:55.618 --> 40:57.819
buying up billions of rounds of
amo?

40:57.821 --> 40:59.820
You just go do a little
research for yourself and you'll

40:59.822 --> 41:02.826
find the ground work for this
has been in place for years.

41:03.726 --> 41:05.759
In an instant these guys can
take over

41:05.761 --> 41:08.195
communications, transportation,
food.

41:08.197 --> 41:10.764
I mean, what's in it for them?

41:10.766 --> 41:12.400
Global totalitarianism.

41:12.402 --> 41:15.802
But you guys are like
mechanics by day,

- Rambo vigilantes by night?
- We're patriots.

41:19.375 --> 41:21.742

sheep

that just accept the way things
are.

41:26.315 --> 41:27.917
and join the resistance, good.

it?

aid

into town a few hours ago.

With the help of what we
believe to be the DHS.

41:54.777 --> 41:57.744
We think those were the
fellas you met on the street.

41:57.746 --> 42:00.081
DONNY: Wait the DHS is in on
this?

42:00.083 --> 42:01.416
Yeah, they have a detention
camp

42:01.418 --> 42:02.849
set up at the local school.

That's where your people will
be.

42:06.188 --> 42:09.389

know the first thing.

42:09.391 --> 42:11.094
We can't do this alone.

42:13.763 --> 42:16.230
Well lucky for you
Kurt and I were prepping

42:16.232 --> 42:17.732
to do some recon on that camp

42:17.734 --> 42:21.201
and possibly set some
of them innocents free.

42:21.203 --> 42:23.170

far.

true, we're talking about

42:25.275 --> 42:28.141
the Department of Homeland
Security, alright?

42:28.143 --> 42:30.311
I want Mark and Becca's
mom free just as much as

42:30.313 --> 42:33.047
everyone else and I wanna
get the hell out of Madison

42:33.049 --> 42:37.384
but you're talking about
taking on the actual U.S. army

42:37.386 --> 42:40.987
with a couple of wannabe
badasses, three civilians,

42:40.989 --> 42:43.925
a wounded internet truther and a
child.

42:43.927 --> 42:45.059
BECCA: Hey.

42:45.061 --> 42:47.829
Yeah, I mean I played my
fair share of Call of Duty

42:47.831 --> 42:50.364
and everything but you're
talking about

42:50.366 --> 42:52.900
some real life serious stuff
here okay?

42:52.902 --> 42:56.471
I am totally, totally
not prepared for a war.

42:56.473 --> 42:59.005
No one's ever prepared for a
war,

42:59.007 --> 43:00.373
but those who are victorious are
the ones

43:00.375 --> 43:02.211
that rise up when all others
falter.

43:03.112 --> 43:05.145
No wait, hold up nobody's
saying

43:05.147 --> 43:07.982
anything about going to war,
alright?

43:07.984 --> 43:09.851
We're not gonna be going in
there,

43:09.853 --> 43:12.255

commandos.

43:13.188 --> 43:15.725
Can you guys get us in there
quietly?

43:17.793 --> 43:19.328
Sure, we can think of
something.

here.

of time.

43:27.369 --> 43:29.105
STEPH: What does that even
mean?

43:32.942 --> 43:34.407
Tomorrow morning the
mainstream media

43:34.409 --> 43:37.445
will tell the country
that a few terrorists

43:37.447 --> 43:39.450
were posing as demonstrators in
Madison.

43:40.917 --> 43:43.050
Troops were ordered in
early in the morning

43:43.052 --> 43:46.119
to detain the criminals
and evacuate some civilians

43:46.121 --> 43:48.458
to a temporary safety
camp at the county school.

43:50.860 --> 43:52.360
Unfortunately, there was a
detonation

43:52.362 --> 43:56.029
at the camp and many lives were
lost.

43:56.031 --> 43:57.898
Wait, there were no terrorists

43:57.900 --> 43:59.933
so why would they blow up the
camp?

43:59.935 --> 44:01.501
Falsifying attacks are
always a sure fire way

44:01.503 --> 44:04.505
to get the public on
board with your cause.

44:04.507 --> 44:06.574
I'm sorry, you think the U.S.
Military

44:06.576 --> 44:08.212
is gonna blow up that camp?

44:09.378 --> 44:11.344
I'm saying the danger
is typically exaggerated

44:11.346 --> 44:12.850
to encourage submission.

44:14.049 --> 44:16.483
We live in a safer world
now than we ever have

44:16.485 --> 44:18.888
but our perception is of a
dangerous one

44:19.956 --> 44:21.422
and that's a perception
that's manufactured

44:21.424 --> 44:24.991
by those who would like to
relieve us of our rights.

44:24.993 --> 44:26.496
So why are they doing all
this?

44:27.596 --> 44:31.431
Who knows, could be war
profiteering,

44:31.433 --> 44:35.069
could be a political move
or it could be just see

44:35.071 --> 44:36.938
how much they can get away with.

44:36.940 --> 44:39.342
Slowly ease the people
into this new way of life.

44:41.411 --> 44:43.444
Nevertheless, it will surely
cause more widespread marshall

44:43.446 --> 44:45.478
all the while demonizing those
of us

44:45.480 --> 44:46.547
who believe in the Constitution.

44:46.549 --> 44:49.016
No, okay you don't know
what's going on, okay?

44:49.018 --> 44:50.286
You are just a nobody.

44:51.554 --> 44:53.456
You're right, you're right we
don't

44:54.857 --> 44:58.125
but the soldier Kurt and I
talked to

44:58.127 --> 45:00.898
on the other hand well now he
was pretty positive about it.

45:01.630 --> 45:03.266
So then how long do we have?

45:04.467 --> 45:07.500
0500, then the bombs go off.

45:07.502 --> 45:09.402
I gotta get moving.

45:09.404 --> 45:10.471
- Come on.
- DONNY: Easy, easy

45:10.473 --> 45:11.572
BECCA: You need to sit.

45:11.574 --> 45:13.608
Tessa, as much as Kurt
and I would love to have you

45:13.610 --> 45:15.175
by our side, the little one's
right.

45:15.177 --> 45:16.911
If you pop one of those stitches
and start to bleed again

45:16.913 --> 45:18.512
you might not be so lucky next
time.

45:18.514 --> 45:19.447
You can't stop me soldier.

45:19.449 --> 45:22.983
No ma'am I can't, but I can
remind you

45:22.985 --> 45:25.054
of how important you are to this
cause.

45:26.589 --> 45:29.523
Look, just bed down here
for the night, alright?

45:29.525 --> 45:32.930
Take this here radio, call
your friends in the morning

45:33.962 --> 45:37.967
and tell the story, that's
what you're meant to do.

45:41.170 --> 45:43.337
- Becca should stay too.
- No.

45:43.339 --> 45:46.273
No we need as many
healthy hands as possible.

45:46.275 --> 45:48.978
Tessa, Roland's right okay?
Just stay here

45:50.212 --> 45:52.982
we'll be fine alright?
We can take care of ourselves.

45:53.683 --> 45:56.683
Besides, you and I still
needa do that interview okay?

45:56.685 --> 45:58.888
So get some rest.

46:00.389 --> 46:02.326
You're gonna be a
great journalist Donny.

46:05.560 --> 46:09.265
- Do me a favor.
- Yeah, of course anything.

46:10.699 --> 46:12.869
- Run my camera.
- Really?

46:20.076 --> 46:21.645
This is Tessa Monroe in
Madison.

46:23.246 --> 46:26.279
Everyone remind yourselves that
what you accomplish tonight

46:26.281 --> 46:27.917
will impact the world tomorrow.

46:29.384 --> 46:31.487
Help those who cannot help
themselves.

46:33.489 --> 46:35.723
Free the minds of those who are
lost

46:35.725 --> 46:39.096
to the chaos of
misinformation and propaganda

46:40.429 --> 46:44.699
but always remember, if
you forgo your freedoms

46:44.701 --> 46:49.172
for the promise of security,
you will have neither.

46:52.074 --> 46:54.110
Okay, I'm gonna cut it there.

46:55.143 --> 46:56.610
Everyone just remember
to send me your footage

46:56.612 --> 46:58.581
in a few days when this all
calms down.

46:59.681 --> 47:01.217

47:03.286 --> 47:05.085

little girl, you know that?

47:05.087 --> 47:08.322
Thanks, you too.
(LAUGHING)

47:08.324 --> 47:10.991

helped out back there.

47:10.993 --> 47:13.527
We're all really glad you're
safe.

47:13.529 --> 47:15.996
We're gonna get you your mom
okay?

47:15.998 --> 47:18.601
I know, I wouldn't be here
if I thought you couldn't.

47:20.603 --> 47:23.570
DONNY: Where'd you guys
get all that sweet gear?

47:23.572 --> 47:27.076
We've had it, should always
be prepared for an emergency.

47:27.743 --> 47:30.244
DONNY: I mean, I've got a
flashlight,

47:30.246 --> 47:33.514
extra battery or two, maybe
half a tube of Neosporin

47:33.516 --> 47:36.483
somewhere but you know, when
I left my house this morning,

47:36.485 --> 47:38.585
I just must've forgotten my
assault rifle

47:38.587 --> 47:40.554
and bullet proof vest, I don't
know.

47:40.556 --> 47:42.489
Yeah, well now you know for
next time.

47:42.491 --> 47:44.324
Next time, there ain't
gonna be a next time.

47:44.326 --> 47:49.332
ASH: My brother and I, our
relationship is complicated

47:49.732 --> 47:52.733
and Stephanie has always
been the one to try

47:52.735 --> 47:55.539
and bring us back together and
uh,

47:56.605 --> 47:59.141
- BECCA: Will she be okay?
- ASH: I hope so.

48:01.277 --> 48:04.246
She's family, you know, and
I'd do anything for family.

48:05.647 --> 48:08.117
(WHISTLING)

48:13.556 --> 48:14.424
What's going on?

48:22.264 --> 48:23.232
So what's the plan?

48:25.067 --> 48:28.436
I just feel a hoard of 'em's
gonna be inside this school.

48:28.438 --> 48:31.572
A big and open area maybe a
gymnasium.

48:31.574 --> 48:33.574
DONNY: So how do we get in?

48:33.576 --> 48:34.775
RAYMOND: Working on it.

48:34.777 --> 48:37.777
I saw this movie once where
this crew, they snuck into

48:37.779 --> 48:40.346
a top secret government
base by sending in someone

48:40.348 --> 48:42.282
as a decoy who pretended he was
hurt.

48:42.284 --> 48:44.250
I mean chances are, if they
already think you're injured,

48:44.252 --> 48:45.853
no one's gonna shoot you right?

48:45.855 --> 48:49.255
So anyways, all I'm saying
is one of us could totally

48:49.257 --> 48:50.724
go up to the fence there with a
limp

48:50.726 --> 48:53.163
or act like they're
hurt and need a bandage.

48:55.397 --> 48:59.266
Wait, no no no no no no
no no that was a bad idea.

48:59.268 --> 49:02.203
Don't listen to me, I don't
really know what I'm saying.

49:02.205 --> 49:05.241
Wait, my camera.
Hold my camera.

49:06.342 --> 49:09.079
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, wish me luck.

49:10.679 --> 49:15.685
ASH: Alright, you two just
hang back and find some cover.

49:16.485 --> 49:17.617
We'll take care of the guards
and then

49:17.619 --> 49:20.154
we'll signal you when it's safe,
okay?

49:20.156 --> 49:20.824
Okay.

49:29.898 --> 49:31.799
BECCA: You don't know
how good you have it.

49:31.801 --> 49:32.933

49:32.935 --> 49:35.869
BECCA: To have so many
people who care about you.

49:35.871 --> 49:37.904
Becca you have family.

49:37.906 --> 49:40.376
BECCA: I have a mom, when
she's there.

49:41.277 --> 49:44.911
Your mom loves you, she
would do anything for you.

49:44.913 --> 49:47.547
BECCA: She would, that's my
point.

49:47.549 --> 49:50.650
Even after giving all
her energy to others,

49:50.652 --> 49:53.089
she will always be by
my side when I need her.

49:53.788 --> 49:55.288
I would do the same for her

49:55.290 --> 49:59.226
'cause that's what family really
is.

alright?

like a wounded hiker.

that your buddy back here

50:24.953 --> 50:26.686
and he needs a medic okay?

50:26.688 --> 50:27.887

50:27.889 --> 50:29.556

that no matter what you do

50:29.558 --> 50:30.690
you turn around and you
come right back here.

freeze?

01:08:33.607 --> 01:08:35.841
into the middle of a blood bath.

01:08:35.843 --> 01:08:37.408
She and you are the terrorists.

01:08:37.411 --> 01:08:41.381
Mark, I know you're in a lot
of pain

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:43.783
but even you have to admit that
this,

01:08:43.785 --> 01:08:47.487
this operation was a false
fly, manufactured by the MGI,

01:08:47.488 --> 01:08:49.654
The Major Globalists
Institutions.

01:08:49.657 --> 01:08:51.689
Mark, please.

01:08:51.692 --> 01:08:55.394
All of you, sitting at home
in your comfy little chairs

01:08:55.395 --> 01:08:56.962
pretending like none of this is
real,

01:08:56.964 --> 01:08:59.532
you should all be ashamed of
yourselves.

01:08:59.533 --> 01:09:02.635
Because of people like
you that humor this idiot

01:09:02.636 --> 01:09:06.537
a lot of good people
are dead or in prison.

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:11.546
Mark, where's he going?
Go get him back here.

01:09:11.745 --> 01:09:15.747
Just, go!
Alright, alright,

01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:18.082
you can cut the feed now.
Cut it.

01:09:18.085 --> 01:09:19.685
(STATIC)

01:09:19.687 --> 01:09:22.423
(INTENSE MUSIC)

01:09:33.868 --> 01:09:37.069
Alright viewers, welcome
back to the Donny D Show.

01:09:37.071 --> 01:09:39.104
We have a very special episode
today,

01:09:39.106 --> 01:09:40.671
this is not a normal video,

01:09:40.674 --> 01:09:42.809
instead, this is a reaction
video.

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:45.042
I just finished watching my good
friend

01:09:45.045 --> 01:09:50.049
Mark's appearance on The
FringeFacts.com site.

01:09:50.051 --> 01:09:52.551
I didn't wanna do a reaction
videos but we just hit

01:09:52.553 --> 01:09:54.686
three million subscribers,
thank you all for that

01:09:54.688 --> 01:09:58.358
and as you know everything
I do is for you, you know,

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.126
the shirt off my back,
the belt around my waist,

01:10:00.128 --> 01:10:01.927
the cat that's running
around my apartment.

01:10:01.929 --> 01:10:03.695
I don't know why you would need
my cat

01:10:03.697 --> 01:10:05.864
and in fact your not getting my
cat.

01:10:05.866 --> 01:10:07.899
But, the thing with reaction
videos is

01:10:07.901 --> 01:10:09.601
I think they're pointless,
they're stupid,

01:10:09.603 --> 01:10:11.069
and they're a waste of
time and there are a lot

01:10:11.071 --> 01:10:13.139
of other things in life
that are pointless, stupid,

01:10:13.141 --> 01:10:15.640
and a waste of time that you
could waste your time on.

01:10:15.642 --> 01:10:18.110
For instance, unboxing videos.

01:10:18.112 --> 01:10:20.445
If you don't know what
an unboxing video is,

01:10:20.447 --> 01:10:21.881
number one you're missing out,
two,

01:10:21.883 --> 01:10:23.582
it is exactly what it sounds
like.

01:10:23.584 --> 01:10:26.485
You watch a video wherein
someone unboxes a box

01:10:26.487 --> 01:10:29.020
that they bought presumably
from a box store.

01:10:29.022 --> 01:10:30.890
Sometimes, the box was
shipped to them from

01:10:30.892 --> 01:10:32.759
an online distributor so they're
opening

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:35.761
a box inside of another box and
sometimes

01:10:35.763 --> 01:10:38.096
those boxes have boxes in them
as well.

01:10:38.098 --> 01:10:40.433
Now, I'm not gonna keep going
on about unboxing videos

01:10:40.435 --> 01:10:41.567
because if you're watching my
channel,

01:10:41.569 --> 01:10:43.871
you know what an unboxing video
is.

01:10:45.773 --> 01:10:48.707
What're we talking about?
Oh, right.

01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:50.143
The whole point of what I'm
doing.

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:52.478
We started talking about
the fact that this video

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.578
was going to be a reaction video

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.648
and I haven't actually
given you my thoughts on it.

01:10:55.650 --> 01:11:00.519
I think the whole thing was a
terrible display of journalism

01:11:00.521 --> 01:11:02.854
which is really the state
of America right now.

01:11:02.856 --> 01:11:07.592
Again, I'm topical and
informative, put that down.

01:11:07.594 --> 01:11:12.564
So it's difficult to watch
that Mark obviously, you know,

01:11:12.566 --> 01:11:15.100
hasn't spent the kind of
time in front of the camera

01:11:15.102 --> 01:11:18.171
and in the media that I have
so he wasn't really prepared

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:21.006
for those kinds of things to
happen

01:11:21.008 --> 01:11:21.975
and how to deal with that.

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:24.577
I haven't heard from
Mark in a little while.

01:11:24.579 --> 01:11:26.645
I've reached out to him a
little bit, I'm sure he's busy

01:11:26.647 --> 01:11:29.215
and obviously he's dealing
with a lot of things

01:11:29.217 --> 01:11:33.685
as thousands of people
that were from Madison

01:11:33.687 --> 01:11:36.221
and were there during
the whole incident are.

01:11:36.223 --> 01:11:37.657
Well hopefully he gets back to
me.

01:11:37.659 --> 01:11:40.158
I would make a plead for him
right on here

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.796
to get back to me but he
does not watch my channel.

01:11:43.798 --> 01:11:46.131
He told me so, it's not a big
deal.

01:11:46.133 --> 01:11:50.168
It kind of is, I wanted feedback
from him.

01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:53.672
Just give me something.
I don't like this take.

01:11:53.674 --> 01:11:55.207
Can we do it again 'cause I
don't really

01:11:55.209 --> 01:11:56.475
know what I'm talking about now.

01:11:56.477 --> 01:11:59.644
I mean they totally railroaded
Mark with all those questions

01:11:59.646 --> 01:12:03.985
and to bring up all that
stuff about Stephanie.

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:07.220
God it's hard to say that name.

01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:09.588
(LAUGHING)

01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:11.727
We're not gonna use that part,
hold on.

01:12:18.098 --> 01:12:19.799
Where was I?

01:12:19.801 --> 01:12:24.036
So Tessa, obviously she used
the footage The FringeFacts,

01:12:24.038 --> 01:12:27.676
they used the footage to look
the way that they wanted it to

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:32.177
I still haven't receive my
own footage from my camera

01:12:32.179 --> 01:12:35.547
that was taken, they said they
would be getting back to me.

01:12:35.549 --> 01:12:36.916
I don't know where it is.

01:12:36.918 --> 01:12:38.850
They've been impossible
to get in touch with.

01:12:38.852 --> 01:12:41.653
I mean, you cannot get
in touch with anyone.

01:12:41.655 --> 01:12:43.055
The government's impossible to
talk with,

01:12:43.057 --> 01:12:44.223
obviously as we knew they would.

01:12:44.225 --> 01:12:46.692
The lawyers, are even hard to
talk with.

01:12:46.694 --> 01:12:48.060
You would think the lawyers
would

01:12:48.062 --> 01:12:50.762
want to get in touch with us.

01:12:50.764 --> 01:12:55.771
Maybe that's them.
No, it is not.

01:12:58.005 --> 01:13:03.011
Tessa, okay.
Footage, is this the footage?

01:13:04.846 --> 01:13:06.811
That would be amazing
if I'm actually talking

01:13:06.813 --> 01:13:08.717
about something and then it
happened.

01:13:10.985 --> 01:13:14.889
This is not the footage.
What is this?

01:13:21.228 --> 01:13:23.065
What is this?
Are you getting this?

01:13:24.197 --> 01:13:25.131
Like it's not grainy on the
screen,

01:13:25.133 --> 01:13:27.135
do you need me to move the
screen at all?

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:37.746
ROLAND: Yeah, yeah,
yes sir we have them

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:44.585
in our custody as we speak.
Tessa, Tessa Monroe is nuts.

01:13:48.889 --> 01:13:50.855
I'll send her my footage 'cause
I think

01:13:50.857 --> 01:13:54.663
that it'll help distract
from tonight's events.

01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:59.133
I mean, the rest of them believed
all the crazy conspiracies

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:01.199
I mean, they were doubtful at
first

01:14:01.201 --> 01:14:03.804
but it didn't take much to
persuade 'em.

01:14:06.374 --> 01:14:07.242
Yes sir.

01:14:08.843 --> 01:14:10.042
Yeah, with his family in our
custody,

01:14:10.044 --> 01:14:14.182
I don't think we'll have a
problem getting John to talk.

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.319
Yes sir.
Yes sir,

01:14:21.321 --> 01:14:22.723
we'll wait for your call.

BECCA'S MOM: Roland, what?

01:14:29.297 --> 01:14:31.700
What, no, Becca, Becca, no!

01:14:33.034 --> 01:14:35.067
- Let go of me, let go of me.
- KURT: Move it, move it

01:14:35.069 --> 01:14:38.037
- move it, pipe down.
- BECCA'S MOM: No, Becca!

01:14:38.039 --> 01:14:40.305
- KURT: Let's go, let's go.
- BECCA'S MOM: No, no!

01:14:40.307 --> 01:14:42.308
- KURT: Quiet down, come on.
- BECCA'S MOM: No, no!

01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:43.408
- Enough.
- BECCA'S MOM: Becca, Becca,

01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:45.279
No, let me down!
Becca!

really is?
