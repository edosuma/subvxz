00:22.731 --> 00:24.941
ADAMA: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.694
I have a message for you.

00:27.778 --> 00:32.198
The fruit born
of two peoples is alive.

00:32.282 --> 00:35.743
A child named after

00:35.828 --> 00:39.205
the wife and sister
of the all-knowing Zeus,

00:39.289 --> 00:42.125
Hera, lives.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.292
It's not true.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.546
SAM: I don't suppose you're gonna
tell me what this is all about.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.965
I mean, what's so important
about this kid?

00:49.049 --> 00:52.218
She may very well be
the shape of things to come.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.011
The Cylons knew exactly
where we were gonna be.

00:54.138 --> 00:55.722
Well, that doesn't mean
Ellen... I didn't do anything!

00:55.806 --> 00:57.390
This is the map, Colonel!

00:57.474 --> 00:59.726
The map that I drew for you. I
gave this to you in your tent.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.603
You were gonna burn it, but then
your wife offered to do it for you.

01:02.688 --> 01:03.688
But she didn't, did she?

01:03.772 --> 01:06.733
I... I want to explain...

01:06.817 --> 01:08.568
He said he'd kill you...
Who said it?

01:08.652 --> 01:11.654
One of the Brother Cavils.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.573
This is Kacey.

01:15.784 --> 01:20.496
Kacey, this is Kara,
your mother.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.254
Our people are gonna attack the
airbase, the detention center,

01:28.338 --> 01:30.339
power station, and other
critical facilities.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.759
The plan is to sow as much
chaos and confusion as possible

01:32.843 --> 01:34.510
the moment Galactica
and Pegasus arrive.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.096
No Pegasus.
Just Galactica.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.264
These are your orders.

01:38.348 --> 01:42.059
Take the civilian fleet,
and wait for me for 18 hours.

01:42.144 --> 01:45.229
If I'm not back in 18 hours,
then find Earth.

01:45.481 --> 01:46.773
ADAMA: You know the mission.

01:46.857 --> 01:50.067
You should also know that there's
only one way that this mission ends,

01:50.152 --> 01:54.697
and that's with the successful rescue
of our people off of New Caprica.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.075
Good hunting.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.877
Hoshi's working on updating
our map coordinates

02:07.961 --> 02:09.879
for the search for Earth.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.217
DUALLA: Civilian captains
want to meet with you.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.136
They have questions,
problems.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.184
Talk to me, Lee.

02:27.397 --> 02:31.692
I'm having trouble
accepting this.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.738
I know. But we have
to push forward,

02:37.282 --> 02:40.034
keep the Fleet together,
find Earth.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.996
Right. That's our duty.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.957
There's still a chance
they'll come back.

02:46.041 --> 02:49.919
Your father has pulled off more
than a few miracles in his day.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.046
I know that.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.759
Yet I haven't given up hope.

02:59.388 --> 03:00.388
Yes, you have.

03:03.267 --> 03:07.311
I saw the look on your face when
you came back from Galactica.

03:07.813 --> 03:10.606
Like you were never
gonna see him again.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.318
Am I that easy to read?

03:16.154 --> 03:17.572
Just to me.

03:22.578 --> 03:27.874
He's taking on too much for one
half-strength battlestar to handle.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.461
That's not opinion.
That's a military fact.

03:34.089 --> 03:37.258
He's not coming back
from this. None of them are.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.386
All we can do is make
plans for the future.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.431
We have to survive.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.058
We have to find Earth.

03:46.977 --> 03:51.147
If we don't, there'll be no one to
remember a man named William Adama,

03:51.231 --> 03:53.608
or a battlestar
named Galactica.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.111
That is our charge to keep.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.240
To keep humanity going.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.284
No matter what the cost,
no matter...

04:03.702 --> 04:05.411
No matter
who we leave behind.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.164
You can do this.
You can get us there.

04:12.002 --> 04:16.213
You are commander of this fleet
and you will guide us to safety.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.424
And you will do it,
no matter the cost.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.552
Because you're an Adama.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.270
Did I ever tell you how
proud I am to serve with you?

04:31.355 --> 04:33.356
Not in so many words, no.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.901
Well, I am proud to serve
with you, Lieutenant.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.029
And to call you my wife.

04:46.286 --> 04:52.291
Now, let's talk about map coordinates,
meeting with ships' captains...

05:03.303 --> 05:04.804
I lost three men today,

05:04.888 --> 05:07.890
and if that Marine sergeant wasn't on
her game, they'd have killed us all.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.308
I know, Gods damn it! I know!

05:09.393 --> 05:12.395
You don't have to keep running your
mouth about it. I get it, all right?

05:12.562 --> 05:15.272
Do you get this?
If Sharon had been killed,

05:15.357 --> 05:17.274
not only would we not get
the launch keys,

05:17.359 --> 05:20.736
but the Cylons would know that we
were in direct contact with Galactica.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.824
Now, this whole plan... The fate of
this whole city would have fallen apart.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.283
Do you understand that,
Colonel?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.827
I get it.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.415
Good. Hey,

05:34.501 --> 05:37.253
you know what has
to be done here.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.130
And if you don't want
to do it, I understand.

05:39.214 --> 05:42.425
But believe me, Colonel,
someone is gonna do this.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.679
Now, it would be better
for her sake if it was you.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.614
(THEME MUSIC)

06:53.497 --> 06:57.958
I had to do it, Saul.
I had to.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.754
It was all for you.

07:01.838 --> 07:06.342
And I want you to know that I
would've done anything to save you.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.178
I know. I know. It's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.263
No, you don't understand.

07:13.683 --> 07:18.020
I got you out of detention,
Saul. It was me.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.689
I got you out.

07:22.692 --> 07:26.320
I went to see them.
The Cylons.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.614
(SIGHING)

07:28.698 --> 07:30.783
Finally got to
the one in charge.

07:32.786 --> 07:38.541
And I got him to notice me
the way men notice me.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.339
I slept with him.

07:45.715 --> 07:49.635
I felt like puking every time
he put his filthy hands on me.

07:50.387 --> 07:55.641
But I smiled and I faked
it to save you, Saul.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.895
But you listen to me.

07:59.980 --> 08:04.650
I'd do it again.
Frak anybody, do anything,

08:08.613 --> 08:11.073
even give them the map.

08:15.078 --> 08:19.915
I didn't want anybody
to be killed.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.225

09:12.260 --> 09:13.677

09:14.512 --> 09:16.639

just curl up here.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.228
There. Attagirl.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.812
I should've listened
to you, Saul.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.274
Should've stayed on Galactica.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.735
Oh, no, don't worry
about any of that now.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.113
You just...

09:35.075 --> 09:36.617
You just go to sleep.

09:36.701 --> 09:37.952

and I've told you,

10:47.897 --> 10:49.231
but to what end?

10:49.983 --> 10:53.193
Too secure in your smug
superiority to listen.

10:53.403 --> 10:57.865
Too comfortable in your
predictions of success

10:58.950 --> 11:01.660
to even consider
the possibility of defeat.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.787
And where are we now?

11:05.582 --> 11:09.168
And more to the point,
where's Laura Roslin?

11:11.504 --> 11:13.255
Where's Tom Zarek?

11:14.632 --> 11:15.883
At large.

11:16.760 --> 11:20.929
Whereabouts unknown, free at any
rate. Probably with Colonel Tigh,

11:22.974 --> 11:25.893
solidifying the insurgency's hold
over the public's imagination.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.437
What would you
have us do, Gaius?

11:31.941 --> 11:33.108
Leave.

11:34.611 --> 11:38.489
Pack up your Centurions
and go.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.118
Please go.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.328
And then what?

11:45.622 --> 11:48.540
What would you do if we
really just left you here?

11:48.625 --> 11:49.833
You'd live out
your lives in peace

11:49.918 --> 11:52.920
and never trouble yourselves
with thoughts of us again?

11:53.004 --> 11:56.215
Or would you raise your children
with stories of the Cylon?

11:56.299 --> 12:00.302
The mechanical slaves who once did
your bidding only to turn against you.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.680
Killers who committed
genocide against your race,

12:03.765 --> 12:06.850
and the occupiers of this city
until we just ran away.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.522
Would you tell them to tell
the story to their children,

12:11.606 --> 12:14.066
and to their
children's children,

12:14.150 --> 12:16.735
and nurse a dream of vengeance
down through the years,

12:16.820 --> 12:18.904
so that one day they could
just go out into the stars

12:18.988 --> 12:21.115
and hunt the Cylon once more?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.496
Blood for blood.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.624

38:38.733 --> 38:41.026
TIGH: Permission
to come aboard, sir?

38:49.911 --> 38:51.078
Hey.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.586
Permission granted.

39:09.597 --> 39:13.308
You did it. You brought 'em home, Saul.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.353
Not all of them.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.068
(WHISPERING) I'm sorry.

We're still double-checking
the Fleet's manifests,

40:26.299 --> 40:29.676
but it doesn't look like Maya
made it off of New Caprica.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.892
What about the baby?

40:42.315 --> 40:46.693
(SOBBING) I was there when the two
guards left to take them to their ship.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.863
I don't know what happened.

40:51.574 --> 40:52.866
I'm so sorry.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.035
I let you down
and I know that.

40:58.373 --> 40:59.832
No, you didn't.

41:02.043 --> 41:03.877
It's not your fault.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.713
This is bigger than us.

41:18.393 --> 41:19.893
This is life.
