WEBVTT

00:11.280 --> 00:12.480
How was that?

00:13.790 --> 00:17.360
Let's try something a bit more challenging, shall we?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.280
Try now.

00:30.950 --> 00:33.720
You told me I have this destiny to save the world from darken

00:33.730 --> 00:37.150
Rahl, and that his soldiers are out there, trying to kill me

00:37.440 --> 00:41.520
But instead of looking for him, I'm slicing fruit for your breakfast.

00:41.780 --> 00:44.330
Rahl and his minions live in the shadows.

00:44.340 --> 00:47.350
Some even cloak themselves in black magic.

00:47.360 --> 00:53.360
By the time you lay eyes on them. Again.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074

01:04.640 --> 01:05.900
What are you doing?

01:06.430 --> 01:08.060
Following my instincts?

01:08.150 --> 01:09.780
You're guessing.

01:10.550 --> 01:12.590
Lesson number four, seeker.

01:12.700 --> 01:16.880
"to see that which is not there, gaze upon what is."

01:16.940 --> 01:19.830
You must learn to perceive the world as no one else can.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.150
Again.

01:54.630 --> 01:55.860
It worked.

01:56.930 --> 01:59.740
Don't be too impressed with yourself.

01:59.750 --> 02:03.520
Your enemies will be far more devious than a melon.

02:36.150 --> 02:37.640
Uh, I'm sorry. richard!

02:37.650 --> 02:41.490
What are you--? no, sorry. i-- I didn't know you were there. richard!

02:41.660 --> 02:44.040
Someone's stealing our horses! what?

02:44.050 --> 02:45.390
The horses!

03:46.630 --> 03:48.560
A highwayman makes off with our

03:48.570 --> 03:51.310
Horses, right under the nose of the seeker

03:51.320 --> 03:53.440
I was distracted.

03:53.450 --> 03:57.160
What on the prophet's good earth could have distracted you?

03:59.610 --> 04:02.120
He was just a boy. he couldn't have been any older than 16.

04:02.130 --> 04:03.350
Was I supposed to kill him?

04:03.360 --> 04:06.600
"where there is no way, the seeker will find a path."

04:06.610 --> 04:07.980
Lesson number four.

04:07.990 --> 04:09.620
You said the last one was number four.

04:09.630 --> 04:12.080
Number five, then!

04:12.210 --> 04:13.390
Are you making these up?

04:13.400 --> 04:14.790
Which way did he go?

04:15.050 --> 04:16.570
Southeast.

04:16.660 --> 04:18.230
He's riding for drundril.

04:18.240 --> 04:23.340
Perhaps someone there will be kind enough to sell us back our horses.

04:26.170 --> 04:29.280
Uh, kahlan, uh, about back at the river.

04:29.290 --> 04:30.750
I didn't see anything.

04:31.680 --> 04:35.790
Richard, you should never lie to a confessor.

04:56.340 --> 04:57.800
Back so soon?

04:58.490 --> 05:00.050
How much for the horses?

05:03.240 --> 05:04.510
One vial.

05:04.710 --> 05:05.680
That's all?

05:05.690 --> 05:07.190
You want it or not?

05:19.770 --> 05:21.670
A pleasure doing business.

05:26.450 --> 05:29.000
Mm. that one.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.490
Miranda.

05:35.010 --> 05:38.110
Yeah. thanks.

05:51.990 --> 05:53.250
Miranda.

06:07.370 --> 06:09.350
Stay away from me.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.210
So any idea? any idea at all?

06:14.220 --> 06:15.680
Take a look around.

06:15.690 --> 06:17.950
This town is filled with thieves and cheats.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.810
There are dozens of boys who could've stolen your horses.

06:22.350 --> 06:23.950
My compliments.

06:24.190 --> 06:25.910
Looks like you could use it.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.590
Thanks.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.970
I hope you had better luck than I did.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.670
No one admits to knowing anything.

06:38.680 --> 06:42.610
Maybe you should just confess them all to find out if anyone's lying.

06:42.680 --> 06:43.990
You can do that?

06:55.810 --> 06:58.000
I think I know where to find our horse thief.

07:07.030 --> 07:08.320
How do you know where we're going?

07:08.330 --> 07:10.400
I don't know. I've just got this feeling.

07:10.410 --> 07:11.640
It's this way.

07:11.850 --> 07:13.280
Something you've been teaching him?

07:13.290 --> 07:15.360
No, I can't take credit for this.

07:15.370 --> 07:17.310
There hasn't been a true seeker in a thousand years.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.550
We may not know what richard's full potential is.

07:23.890 --> 07:25.140
That's him.

07:25.990 --> 07:29.840
Maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to dismiss your instincts.

07:36.420 --> 07:38.140
Tell us where the horses are.

07:41.530 --> 07:43.080
I don't have them anymore.

07:43.090 --> 07:47.660
But I can tell you who does for 10-- no, 20 pieces of gold.

07:49.940 --> 07:52.520
All I have is one piece of steel.

07:52.530 --> 07:54.440
Now tell me where they are.

07:54.450 --> 07:56.830
I can't. the peddlers will kill me.

07:56.840 --> 07:57.940
What peddlers?

07:57.950 --> 08:00.180
Perhaps the gentle touch of a confessor

08:00.190 --> 08:03.080
Will, uh, convince you to be more cooperative

08:03.090 --> 08:04.330
All right.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.910
I'll take you to them.

08:09.620 --> 08:12.690
I need something to give me luck at the table.

08:12.800 --> 08:17.950
I can't make you lucky, but I can give you this.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.690
You'll be able to see right through your opponents' cards.

08:21.770 --> 08:23.130
Sir.

08:23.430 --> 08:28.110
I believe you have some horses that were stolen from us.

08:28.270 --> 08:29.830
We want them back.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.909
You mean the horses he traded me?

08:34.320 --> 08:36.570
Look, we didn't come here to fight.

08:36.580 --> 08:38.760
We just want what belongs to us.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.320
Get rid of them.

08:54.670 --> 08:55.960
You!

08:58.270 --> 09:00.110
You brought these people here!

09:36.570 --> 09:37.840
Stop.

09:39.060 --> 09:41.010
I'm warning you.

09:41.230 --> 09:42.530
No!

09:48.030 --> 09:49.430
He's a wizard!

09:58.890 --> 10:00.080
Are you all right?

10:04.220 --> 10:05.640
Hello again.

10:06.580 --> 10:09.030
I see you found the boy you were looking for.

10:09.270 --> 10:11.170
Glad I could be of service.

10:11.340 --> 10:13.050
What? what do you mean?

10:13.060 --> 10:17.410
The pint you drank. I mixed in something magical.

10:17.420 --> 10:19.010
An elixir.

10:19.010 --> 10:21.900
Helps you find whatever it is you're looking for.

10:21.910 --> 10:23.750
You put something in my drink?

10:24.390 --> 10:28.340
Heh. you didn't really think you had some kind of special power, did you?

10:28.830 --> 10:30.840
I have more of that potion.

10:30.890 --> 10:32.320
Others too.

10:32.750 --> 10:37.000
If you're interested, you know where to find me.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.690
Something wrong?

10:42.700 --> 10:43.950
Oh, I'm fine.

10:44.490 --> 10:45.800
Gentlemen.

10:46.430 --> 10:48.610
Um, this is my store.

10:48.620 --> 10:50.910
If you need supplies-- oh, no.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.540
Thanks. we have to be on our way.

10:52.550 --> 10:56.590
I-- I saw your blade.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.680
The, uh-- the markings.

11:02.940 --> 11:04.950
It's the sword of truth, isn't it?

11:06.640 --> 11:08.020
It is.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.860
You're the seeker.

11:12.150 --> 11:16.450
You can save this town from the men who are trying to destroy it.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.230
There's another wizard in the village.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.070
Another wizard.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.910
It'll be good to have some company.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.260
Bring him to me.

11:55.570 --> 11:58.350
the prophecy said that the seeker would one

11:58.360 --> 12:01.500
Day return, and lift the shroud of darkness from our--

12:01.510 --> 12:06.020
From our lives, but-- most people thought it was just legend

12:06.540 --> 12:13.390
But here you are, ready t-t-to save our village from these magic peddlers.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.410
They sell magic?

12:15.420 --> 12:19.310
They're on every street corner, in the tavern...

12:19.320 --> 12:23.260
Seems like everybody in the village is buying their potions.

12:23.270 --> 12:27.340
I-i've lost most of my customers.

12:27.530 --> 12:34.510
Farmers are not sowing their fields, children are being left to go hungry.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.320
That boy I saw you with, jack...

12:37.330 --> 12:38.810
What about him?

12:39.360 --> 12:42.530
He was a-- he was a fine young man until his

12:42.620 --> 12:45.540
Parents traded everything they had for magic

12:45.550 --> 12:47.060
Even their home.

12:47.260 --> 12:50.030
He was, uh-- he was left to fend for himself.

12:50.780 --> 12:53.590
What kind of potions are these peddlers selling?

12:54.050 --> 12:58.790
The kind that give ordinary folk powers they shouldn't have.

12:59.380 --> 13:04.100
Curses, hexes, spells of every kind.

13:04.190 --> 13:09.500
These peddlers, they're not wizards or sorcerers.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.100
Where does the magic they sell come from?

13:13.450 --> 13:14.920
Couldn't say.

13:15.670 --> 13:19.440
Uh, one day, they were just here.

13:20.350 --> 13:24.660
Drundril was a good place to live before they came.

13:26.100 --> 13:31.450
And now that the seeker is here, it can be good again.

13:42.670 --> 13:47.090
I want to help these people, but my mission is to fight darken rahl.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.700
Rahl isn't the only evil in the midlands.

13:49.710 --> 13:52.820
He has his sympathizers and collaborators.

13:52.830 --> 13:55.610
It's the seeker's duty to fight them wherever he can.

13:55.620 --> 13:58.120
remember "before chopping off the head,

13:58.130 --> 14:01.160
"make certain the body is dead, lest the head grow back.

14:01.170 --> 14:03.180
What lesson is that? no lesson.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.000
Just something I learned in a cookbook.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.390
My lady.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.530
It's all right.

14:09.950 --> 14:14.360
Theodoro rymus, at your service.

14:18.550 --> 14:21.470
I've chased away the men who were threatening you.

14:22.090 --> 14:24.470
Is there anything more I can do to please you?

14:24.480 --> 14:25.750
There is.

14:25.760 --> 14:29.190
The potions you sell. where do they come from?

14:29.200 --> 14:30.600
The old prophets' temple.

14:30.610 --> 14:32.290
Two leagues north of here.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.360
We'll need our horses back.

14:34.470 --> 14:37.730
I'm sorry. I sold them to a trader.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.450
You what? no.

14:40.030 --> 14:41.940
He left town this morning.

14:42.110 --> 14:43.620
But I can take you to the temple.

14:43.630 --> 14:46.350
That's not necessary. you can draw us a map.

14:46.360 --> 14:50.420
Then, theodoro, I want you to leave this village.

14:50.430 --> 14:51.740
Leave?

14:51.870 --> 14:53.710
We can't just let him go.

14:53.720 --> 14:57.780
Leave this village and take up honest work.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.730
Do you understand me?

15:00.610 --> 15:02.070
As you wish.

15:13.340 --> 15:15.330
That magic peddler, rymus.

15:15.340 --> 15:16.810
What did kahlan do to him?

15:16.820 --> 15:18.900
Now you know why she's called a "confessor."

15:18.910 --> 15:22.200
With a single touch, kahlan can bend anyone to her will.

15:22.210 --> 15:25.430
She can make a person tell the truth, that's the "confessor" part.

15:25.440 --> 15:28.830
Or she can compel him to do unimaginable things.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.330
I saw her do it back in hartland.

15:30.340 --> 15:33.140
She made a d'haran soldier kill his comrades.

15:33.150 --> 15:34.810
I didn't understand what was happening.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.220
But why did rymus come back?

15:37.230 --> 15:39.500
And the way he was looking at her...

15:39.530 --> 15:42.490
It's one of the repercussions of kahlan's powers.

15:42.500 --> 15:47.310
The confessed falls in love with the woman who confessed him.

15:47.320 --> 15:48.630
In love?

15:49.200 --> 15:50.410
I don't understand.

15:50.420 --> 15:53.230
It's complicated.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.510
I'd like to know.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.590
It's something that's not easy for kahlan.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.330
It's a heavy burden she carries.

15:59.340 --> 16:00.820
It's not for me to talk about.

16:00.830 --> 16:05.280
Maybe she'll tell you-- I didn't mean now!

16:10.140 --> 16:11.560
Kahlan!

16:11.910 --> 16:14.320
Richard!

16:47.350 --> 16:48.630
Ä§×èÏîÈ¦.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.110
What if he wakes up?

16:50.120 --> 16:54.810
As long as he's wearing this, he won't be able to use his magic.

17:15.609 --> 17:17.910
Kahlan? Kahlan!

17:25.000 --> 17:26.420
Zedd?

17:27.740 --> 17:29.070
He's gone.

17:29.490 --> 17:30.910
We have to find him.

17:36.290 --> 17:37.690
Peddlers.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.830
We know where their temple is.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.610
Maybe this is the wrong place.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.790
Maybe rymus lied to you.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.220
That's not possible.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.800
Well, what?

18:04.980 --> 18:06.380
They've moved?

18:06.730 --> 18:07.960
But where?

18:16.700 --> 18:18.200
Jeziah?

18:20.930 --> 18:22.780
Zeddicus, old friend.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.090
Forgive me.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.000
I hope my men didn't hurt you.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.580
M-- my companions.

18:29.810 --> 18:31.340
They weren't harmed.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.610
If this is how you greet an old friend,

18:34.620 --> 18:37.550
I'm glad we didn't part on worse terms

18:37.690 --> 18:39.040
When I heard there was a wizard in the

18:39.050 --> 18:41.560
Village, I assumed he was working for darken rahl

18:41.980 --> 18:43.840
If I'd known it was you, I would've invited you

18:43.850 --> 18:46.330
For roasted partridge instead of having you abducted

18:46.340 --> 18:49.540
Why would you assume I worked for that tyrant?

18:49.790 --> 18:52.800
The midlands have changed since you disappeared, zeddicus.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.860
Sorcerers and dark wizards are everywhere,

18:55.870 --> 18:58.660
Ready to do the bitng of whoever pays the most

18:59.890 --> 19:02.490
I have so much to tell you, zeddicus.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.100
But first...

19:05.540 --> 19:08.380
Where have you been all these years?

19:10.950 --> 19:13.600
No tracks. anywhere.

19:13.610 --> 19:16.190
They must've used a spell to cloak their trail.

19:16.970 --> 19:18.550
You shouldn't have let rymus go.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.280
He could've helped us find zedd.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.790
What?

19:28.420 --> 19:33.600
When I confess someone, they lose their free will.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.770
They become...

19:36.480 --> 19:38.020
...like a slave.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.620
I don't believe it's right to continue forcing

19:41.630 --> 19:44.140
Them to do my bidding any longer than I have to

19:44.150 --> 19:45.960
Even someone like rymus?

19:45.970 --> 19:48.400
People deserve a chance to change.

19:49.220 --> 19:51.620
To become better than what the world made them.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.440
Your instinct as a seeker. it led you to the boy.

19:56.740 --> 19:58.550
You could use it to find zedd.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.130
It wasn't any "seeker instinct."

20:06.210 --> 20:08.330
But you found jack.

20:08.710 --> 20:11.700
The barmaid at the tavern slipped something in my drink.

20:11.770 --> 20:13.890
One of those potions. what?

20:13.900 --> 20:16.550
That's how I found jack. it had nothing to do with me.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.620
But it did work.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.250
I could go back and get more.

20:24.260 --> 20:27.570
No. magic is not meant to be used in that way.

20:27.580 --> 20:30.090
You use magic. you confessed rymus.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.100
I was born with this power.

20:32.110 --> 20:34.580
I didn't buy it in a tavern.

20:34.590 --> 20:36.200
What's the difference?

20:36.210 --> 20:38.740
Richard, you've seen what these potions can do.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.830
What happened to that village, to jack.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.370
I know you wanna protect me 'cause I'm the

20:42.380 --> 20:45.020
Seeker, but-- it's not just because you're the seeker

20:45.930 --> 20:47.350
Richard, i...

20:48.780 --> 20:50.440
Seeker!

20:51.220 --> 20:53.860
You gotta come right away!

20:54.320 --> 20:56.740
Jack's in trouble!

21:00.230 --> 21:03.010
We crossed the boundary two months ago,

21:03.020 --> 21:05.590
And we've been on the road since then

21:06.310 --> 21:08.430
And this young man you're traveling with,

21:08.940 --> 21:11.210
You really believe he's the true seeker

21:11.220 --> 21:13.620
He has a lot to learn, but...

21:13.910 --> 21:17.880
Yes, he is the genuine article.

21:20.180 --> 21:21.890
And take it from one who knows,

21:22.030 --> 21:24.500
He could have no better teacher than you, zeddicus

21:25.410 --> 21:28.200
The people of the midlands have new reason to hope.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.660
Dare I ask, what you were planning to do with

21:31.670 --> 21:34.790
Me in the event that I wasn't your old friend

21:35.940 --> 21:37.320
Let me show you.

21:54.510 --> 21:55.950
A quillion?

21:57.040 --> 21:57.940
Where did you--?

21:57.950 --> 21:59.910
It wasn't easy to come by.

22:00.740 --> 22:02.470
If you had been one of rahl's wizards,

22:02.480 --> 22:09.180
I would've used it to absorb your magic, and distill it into this

22:11.680 --> 22:16.550
You're making the magic that's being peddled on the streets of drundril.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.130
Why?

22:20.330 --> 22:23.650
The sale of these potions will allow me to raise a militia.

22:23.660 --> 22:25.580
An army of the midlands.

22:25.750 --> 22:28.660
A force powerful enough to fight rahl and his followers.

22:28.670 --> 22:29.910
Jeziah.

22:30.220 --> 22:33.040
I want to defeat darken rahl too.

22:33.050 --> 22:35.450
But selling magic?

22:35.460 --> 22:37.680
It goes against everything we believe in.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.630
Everything I taught you.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.340
Those teachings are from another era, old friend.

22:42.350 --> 22:44.950
Rahl isn't playing by any rules.

22:45.740 --> 22:49.810
And that justifies exploiting these villagers?

22:49.820 --> 22:51.770
Their lives are dreary.

22:51.780 --> 22:54.400
They're suffocating under rahl's edicts.

22:54.410 --> 22:56.590
The magic gives them an escape.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.570
Magic is-- is rare.

22:59.580 --> 23:01.460
It's-- it's special.

23:01.470 --> 23:05.670
You can't just sell it on the streets to anyone for a few copper coins.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.960
In the wrong hands, it-- it ruins lives.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.410
It kills!

23:09.850 --> 23:11.570
One village is a small price to pay

23:11.580 --> 23:13.870
If we can save the rest of the midlands

23:16.380 --> 23:19.280
You've forgotten more about magic than I'll ever know.

23:19.290 --> 23:20.870
If we work together,

23:21.290 --> 23:24.650
We can find other wizards and sorcerers working for rahl

23:24.660 --> 23:28.110
Drain them of their magic. create a more powerful army!

23:28.240 --> 23:31.480
You expect me to help you?

23:31.490 --> 23:33.690
Hear me out. I've heard more than enough!

23:38.460 --> 23:42.410
Tell them to move. jeziah!

23:48.080 --> 23:49.610
What are you doing?

23:49.620 --> 23:51.110
I'm sorry, old friend.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.280
My work is too important.

23:59.800 --> 24:03.690
I paid rymus before you and your mates drove him off.

24:03.760 --> 24:08.940
Now, I want my money, or the potion I paid for.

24:09.350 --> 24:10.920
I don't have either!

24:13.910 --> 24:16.400
I guess I'm gonna have to take it out on your hide, then.

24:16.730 --> 24:18.200
Leave the boy alone.

24:22.020 --> 24:23.590
This ain't your village.

24:24.110 --> 24:25.980
And who are you to interfere?

24:31.680 --> 24:33.300
Get out of here, now!

24:38.460 --> 24:40.900
Take care of him. I'll be back. where are you going?

24:40.910 --> 24:43.320
Richard, no! this is getting worse.

24:43.330 --> 24:46.130
And we need to find zedd. who knows what's happening to him?

24:46.140 --> 24:47.180
This is not the way.

24:47.190 --> 24:49.480
You can't keep using these potions.

24:50.110 --> 24:51.950
I don't want to do it, either.

24:52.430 --> 24:54.270
But I don't have any other idea.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.610
Do you?

25:02.430 --> 25:04.120
I knew you'd be back.

25:05.210 --> 25:07.420
It's that pretty girl you were with, isn't it?

25:07.630 --> 25:09.860
I saw the way you were looking at her.

25:10.600 --> 25:14.060
I have something that'll make you irresistible to her.

25:14.070 --> 25:15.940
No, no. I want what you gave me before.

25:16.190 --> 25:17.780
How much can you pay?

25:18.770 --> 25:20.250
I don't have any money.

25:20.340 --> 25:22.540
Then I'm sorry, I can't help you.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.610
My friend is in a lot of trouble.

25:26.620 --> 25:28.950
There's must be something I can trade.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.890
That's an interesting pendant.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.830
This? my father gave it to me.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.050
It's all I have left of him.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.160
Must be valuable.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.420
Only to me.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.510
There must be something else I can give. please.

25:43.150 --> 25:44.980
You have nothing else I want.

25:51.090 --> 25:52.280
Fine.

26:15.130 --> 26:16.620
What did you see?

26:16.630 --> 26:19.010
My friend. he's hurt.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.570
He was underground. are their caves near here?

26:21.580 --> 26:23.880
Dozens of them. south of the gully.

26:24.210 --> 26:26.770
How do I know which one? the potion will lead you.

26:26.780 --> 26:29.030
But it won't last. you'd better hurry.

26:36.450 --> 26:38.820
This is your fault. you and your friends.

26:38.830 --> 26:41.690
I guess you should've stolen someone else's horses.

26:42.020 --> 26:43.400
I needed them.

26:43.650 --> 26:45.050
To buy magic.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.010
What did you use it for?

26:48.030 --> 26:49.340
A girl.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.720
A girl? yeah.

26:52.180 --> 26:53.710
Tell me about her.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.820
Her name's miranda.

26:56.850 --> 26:58.900
She works at the flower stand.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.710
Prettiest in the whole town.

27:01.980 --> 27:05.330
But she won't even look at me, unless I use the potion.

27:06.510 --> 27:08.520
Have you tried talking to her?

27:08.530 --> 27:09.900
I-i don't know what to say.

27:09.910 --> 27:11.790
I can't even think when I'm around her.

27:13.970 --> 27:15.250
Of course.

27:15.690 --> 27:17.380
You could confess miranda.

27:17.390 --> 27:18.830
Make her like me.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.820
Not just for a few minutes, but all the time.

27:21.830 --> 27:24.550
I could never use my power in that way, jack.

27:25.750 --> 27:27.720
Love is a choice we make.

27:28.150 --> 27:33.570
If you take away that choice, it's not really love, is it?

27:33.580 --> 27:39.500
Someone loving you, wanting to be with you, because you forced them...?

27:40.840 --> 27:44.640
Trust me, it won't make you happy.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.200
I can find zedd, but we have to go now.

28:40.860 --> 28:42.040
One word from me and

28:42.050 --> 28:44.640
My little friend will make a meal out of you

28:46.020 --> 28:48.690
Cut me loose and I'll tell him to let you go.

28:55.450 --> 29:00.080
The quillion will absorb all of your power in a matter of hours.

29:01.510 --> 29:04.110
Then not even the rats will follow you.

29:06.410 --> 29:08.220
But it doesn't have to be this way.

29:09.690 --> 29:11.980
Where is your militia, jeziah?

29:12.950 --> 29:15.170
All I see are thugs and thieves.

29:15.900 --> 29:20.500
Are they going to be the generals in your army of the midlands?

29:21.650 --> 29:22.960
If you wanted to fight rahl,

29:22.970 --> 29:26.100
You could be out there doing it now, but you're not, are you

29:26.110 --> 29:28.560
I need time and money to build an army.

29:28.570 --> 29:30.790
How much more do you need?

29:30.990 --> 29:33.810
The villagers have given you everything they own.

29:34.950 --> 29:38.300
Are you sure you're not just making yourself rich?

29:38.490 --> 29:42.370
Using magic to acquire power over others?

29:42.430 --> 29:44.660
Do not judge me, zeddicus.

29:44.670 --> 29:46.430
You of all people have no right.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.400
You ran away at the moment you were needed most.

29:48.410 --> 29:50.610
I left to protect the seeker!

29:50.620 --> 29:53.640
Are you sure you weren't really protecting yourself?

29:54.460 --> 29:58.060
Using magic for your own gain.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.950
You say you want to destroy rahl?

30:01.160 --> 30:03.590
You're just like him.

30:10.050 --> 30:11.930
And you're just an old fool.

30:18.390 --> 30:19.660
Here.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.580
Are you angry with me?

30:25.950 --> 30:27.300
I'm not angry.

30:27.310 --> 30:29.500
Your forehead wrinkles when you're upset.

30:31.060 --> 30:35.260
I'm not upset, I'm-- ah.

30:43.490 --> 30:44.710
You all right?

30:48.410 --> 30:50.270
Maybe I shouldn't have gone back for the potion.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.030
But you have to admit, it's working.

30:53.150 --> 30:54.710
And when you have a problem that you

30:54.720 --> 30:57.110
Can't solve with magic, what will you do then

30:59.720 --> 31:00.990
Richard!

31:01.190 --> 31:03.790
I'll protect you. I told you to leave.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.230
You told me to leave the village.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.440
And I did.

31:06.450 --> 31:09.010
But I love you too much to be out of your sight.

31:09.870 --> 31:13.200
I won't leave you again, my lady.

31:24.370 --> 31:25.600
Richard.

31:32.020 --> 31:32.980
Richard.

31:32.990 --> 31:35.150
Don't hurt him.

31:35.430 --> 31:36.630
He tried to kill me.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.310
He thought he was protecting me.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.940
I'm prepared to die for her. are you?

31:41.480 --> 31:43.220
He can't help it.

31:43.850 --> 31:46.280
He's not in control of his feelings.

31:49.850 --> 31:51.440
We have to find zedd.

31:54.300 --> 31:55.620
Which way?

31:56.520 --> 31:57.870
I don't know.

31:59.270 --> 32:00.520
Richard.

32:00.890 --> 32:05.400
The potion, I think it's wearing off.

32:07.180 --> 32:08.410
Pack everything.

32:08.420 --> 32:11.380
We're leaving as soon as the quillion has done its work.

32:11.490 --> 32:14.450
Why? no one can find us here.

32:14.820 --> 32:16.720
He's traveling with the seeker.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.000
Do you want me to kill him?

32:23.180 --> 32:25.370
I don't know which is more merciful.

32:26.210 --> 32:30.570
To kill him, or force him to live without his powers.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.960
This is his fault. if he hadn't delayed us...

32:37.970 --> 32:40.180
You worked for these people, you know where their cave is?

32:40.190 --> 32:42.110
I only knew about the temple.

32:43.900 --> 32:45.750
Where are you going? back to the tavern.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.980
You can do this without the potion, richard.

32:47.990 --> 32:49.060
You're the seeker.

32:49.070 --> 32:51.190
The seeker of truth, not of wizards.

32:51.200 --> 32:54.100
The potion's gotten us this far, it can help us the rest of the way.

32:54.110 --> 32:56.200
What would zedd say if he were here?

32:57.290 --> 33:02.240
If he saw you relying on magic instead of your wits, and your senses?

33:04.960 --> 33:07.620
You can do this without magic, richard.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.190
I believe in you.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.170
I don't know where to start.

33:14.430 --> 33:17.440
The vision you had of zedd, what do you remember?

33:20.590 --> 33:26.400
It was dark, there was green on the wall.

33:27.810 --> 33:29.570
Glittermoss.

33:30.320 --> 33:31.620
Does that help us?

33:31.630 --> 33:36.400
It only grows where there's fresh water nearby, like a river or lake.

33:36.410 --> 33:38.010
Echo lake isn't far.

33:38.020 --> 33:39.010
That must be it.

33:39.020 --> 33:40.390
There are a lot of caves.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.120
It could take us days to search them.

33:42.130 --> 33:44.380
The moss was being fed by water dripping downwards.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.010
It's below the waterline.

33:46.020 --> 33:48.620
The lowlands. south of the lake.

33:48.630 --> 33:50.470
There are only a few caves there.

33:50.480 --> 33:53.120
Take us. I only follow her orders.

33:53.130 --> 33:54.620
Take us there.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.550
Glittermoss.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.280
Zedd?

34:19.530 --> 34:20.739
Zedd.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.699
My boy.

34:25.449 --> 34:28.150
They've taken my powers.

34:41.929 --> 34:43.469
Why aren't they masking their trail?

34:43.480 --> 34:45.739
They're moving too fast. they mustn't have time.

34:46.790 --> 34:48.719
There they are.

34:54.650 --> 34:56.290
Hey, stop the cart.

35:00.260 --> 35:01.610
There's only two of them.

35:01.620 --> 35:04.290
You forget who's after us. stop them.

35:06.260 --> 35:08.970
That's the wizard who stole my powers.

35:13.470 --> 35:14.760
My lady!

35:16.470 --> 35:17.910
I'll save you!

35:40.130 --> 35:42.810
Ai Tieah Deirry Narlah

35:44.460 --> 35:47.110
Strike me down if you can, seeker.

35:54.470 --> 35:59.020
To see that which is not there, gaze upon what is.

36:30.140 --> 36:31.510
Kahlan!

36:34.460 --> 36:36.070
Richard, the wizard!

36:48.460 --> 36:49.670
No!

36:55.500 --> 36:56.920
No!

37:23.820 --> 37:25.200
Oh, my lady.

37:25.210 --> 37:26.560
Try not to move.

37:26.850 --> 37:31.900
All my life, I've been a thief, a liar.

37:33.030 --> 37:39.350
Thank you for letting me die with honor.

37:45.260 --> 37:46.840
You should kill me.

37:47.230 --> 37:49.620
We're taking you to a healer.

37:50.520 --> 37:53.690
You'll wear the rada'han for the rest of your life.

37:54.070 --> 37:57.720
You'll never have the powers of a wizard again, old friend.

37:58.980 --> 38:00.540
You know him?

38:01.330 --> 38:03.040
I thought I did.

38:10.990 --> 38:12.470
You all right?

38:13.750 --> 38:15.880
I've absorbed most of my powers.

38:16.550 --> 38:18.530
Not quite back to my old self.

38:18.540 --> 38:20.170
Maybe in a couple of days.

38:20.290 --> 38:21.490
Maybe?

38:22.030 --> 38:24.380
If there's one thing I've learned about

38:24.390 --> 38:26.220
Magic, it's that nothing is guaranteed

38:27.580 --> 38:29.570
Magic tore this town apart.

38:30.010 --> 38:31.560
I used it twice.

38:31.670 --> 38:34.330
I would've gone back a third time if kahlan hadn't stopped me.

38:34.380 --> 38:38.170
According to her, it was your tracking skills that found me in the end.

38:38.810 --> 38:42.540
It was our training that helped you defeat jeziah.

38:43.080 --> 38:49.660
But if I hadn't used the potion, I wouldn't have known you were in a cave.

38:50.190 --> 38:51.640
You could have died.

38:52.070 --> 38:55.820
So then, magic is a good thing?

38:56.580 --> 39:01.250
Rymus wouldn't have helped us if kahlan hadn't used magic to confess him.

39:01.450 --> 39:02.910
True enough.

39:03.150 --> 39:05.740
But on the other hand, he'd still be alive.

39:06.940 --> 39:09.400
I can see why it's such a burden for her.

39:09.830 --> 39:13.620
So, what lessons do you draw from all this, seeker?

39:14.980 --> 39:17.180
There aren't any easy answers.

39:17.190 --> 39:21.590
Magic isn't good or bad, it's...complicated.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.390
Ah, yes.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.820
That's lesson number six.

39:27.910 --> 39:30.660
You are making these up, aren't you?

39:38.330 --> 39:39.550
Richard.

39:39.560 --> 39:42.770
I found something that belongs to you.

39:47.640 --> 39:48.930
How did you--?

39:48.940 --> 39:52.660
Confessors can be quite persuasive.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.620
I can't thank you enough.

40:01.630 --> 40:04.150
Everyone in this village is in your debt.

40:04.270 --> 40:07.050
Even if they're not gonna be happy about it.

40:09.030 --> 40:10.520
Your neighbors are just gonna have to

40:10.530 --> 40:12.840
Learn to fix their problems without magic

40:13.390 --> 40:15.180
Maybe you can show them how.

40:15.310 --> 40:16.500
Me?

40:23.160 --> 40:24.450
Excuse me.

40:25.020 --> 40:27.450
One rose, please. a white one.

40:28.210 --> 40:29.630
Five pence.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.220
Is it for her?

40:36.570 --> 40:38.810
No, it's for you.

40:39.220 --> 40:42.420
I never see anyone buy flowers for the flower girl.

40:45.470 --> 40:47.720
I know this doesn't make up for what I did.

40:48.120 --> 40:51.270
But I hope someday we can be friends.

41:00.190 --> 41:02.090
Maybe there's hope for them.

41:02.760 --> 41:07.200
Maybe for them, but not for the two of you.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.490
What are you talking about?

41:11.880 --> 41:14.430
Kahlan, richard has feelings for you.

41:16.660 --> 41:18.470
You're imagining things.

41:18.480 --> 41:23.420
To see that which is not there, gaze upon what is.

41:24.370 --> 41:29.190
I see the way he looks at you, and how you're starting to notice him.

41:30.040 --> 41:34.210
But you know neither of you can ever act on these feelings.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.650
So the question is,

41:37.310 --> 41:41.120
Are you going to tell him, or shall i?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
