>> IT'S IN MY BEST INTEREST TO
HAVE CHRISTMAS STAY IN THIS

02:08.862 --> 02:11.665
HOUSE INSTEAD OF JILLIAN BECAUSE

02:28.316 --> 02:31.385
WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS THAT I
AM PLAYING MY OWN GAME, PLAYING

02:31.419 --> 02:32.553
FOR ME.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.556
>> BEFORE THE LIVE EVICTION,
CHRISTMAS REVEALS HER NAUGHTY

02:35.589 --> 02:36.724

PLUS THE FOURTH OF JULY MAY BE
OVER, BUT THE FIREWORKS ARE JUST

03:33.947 --> 03:35.082
GETTING STARTED.

03:35.115 --> 03:40.488
>> YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE A MAN AT

03:40.521 --> 03:41.722
YOU SOUND LIKE A CHILD, A POUTY
CHILD THAT IS-- SIT AND CRIES

03:41.755 --> 03:42.690

04:42.215 --> 04:46.454
>> I'M GETTING PEGGED IN THE
HEAD.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.523
>> GOING INTO THE EVICTION,
CHRISTMAS SHOULD BE OUT THIS

04:49.557 --> 04:50.691
WEEK.

04:50.724 --> 04:54.895
JESSICA AND I WERE BLINDSIDED
BECAUSE MARK, RAMSES, JOSH,

04:54.928 --> 04:59.333
ALEX, JASON AND KEVIN WERE ALL
SUPPOSED TO VOTE OUT CHRISTMAS.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.668
>> CHRISTMAS, I WANT HER OUT.

05:00.701 --> 05:04.938
IF WE CAN GET THE NUMBERS TO GET
HER OUT, I'M ON BOARD.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.841
>> TOMORROW NIGHT WHEN I GO IN
THERE, I WILL SAY I VOTE FOR

05:07.875 --> 05:09.977
CHRISTMAS TO LEAVE, THAT'S MY
WORD.

>> YOU GUYS ARE ON OUR SIDE NOW.

05:11.879 --> 05:12.312
>> ABSOLUTELY.

05:12.346 --> 05:12.946
>> GOOD.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.715
>> THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.249
>> CHRISTMAS SHOULD GO HOME THIS
WEEK.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.385
>> OKAY.

05:17.418 --> 05:20.654
I'M GOING TO DO THAT, BUT DO I
HAVE SAFETY WITH YOU GUYS.

05:20.688 --> 05:21.855
>> SAFETY FOR YOU, SAFETY FOR
US.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.324
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

05:24.358 --> 05:24.992
>> OKAY, COOL.

05:25.025 --> 05:32.132
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

05:32.165 --> 05:32.966
>> O-W!

05:33.000 --> 05:36.904
>> COME ON.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.407
>> THE HOUSE IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY
RIGHT NOW.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.709
THE VOTES WENT THE WAY I WANTED
THEM TO.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.478
CODY AND JESSICA WERE
BLINDSIDED, PEOPLE ARE SAD,

05:44.512 --> 05:46.213
PEOPLE ARE MAD, EVERYBODY'S
LOSING IT.

05:46.246 --> 05:56.289
THIS IS PERFECT.

05:56.289 --> 06:04.398
THIS IS PERFECT.

06:04.432 --> 06:08.268
SO AFTER THE VOTES ARE REVEALED
I TELL CODY THE TRUTH ABOUT MY

06:08.301 --> 06:11.505
VOTE BECAUSE I KNOW AS SOON AS I
CAST THAT VOTE, THE SIDES WERE

06:11.539 --> 06:12.773
SPLIT.

06:12.806 --> 06:19.146
I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH CODY
BECAUSE I STILL RESPECT HIM AS A

06:19.179 --> 06:20.013
MAN.

06:20.047 --> 06:24.752
>> THAT'S FINE, THAT'S FINE,
THAT'S FINE.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.655
>> YOU'RE KIND OF A COULD YOU
AD, YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID

06:27.688 --> 06:31.091
SOMETHING TO ME WHEN I WASN'T
ALLOWED TO HAVE A VOTE.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.159
>> ACTUALLY, YOU LIED.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.360
>> ACTUALLY I DIDN'T.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.129
YOU LITERALLY LOOKED ME IN THE
EYE SAYING IF YOU STAY IN THIS

06:36.163 --> 06:38.699
HOUSE ARE YOU COMING FOR ME AND
CODY, WHY WOULD I GIVE YOU MY

06:38.732 --> 06:39.232
VOTE.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.100
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.002
>> WHY WOULD I VOTE FOR YOU TO
STAY HERE.

06:42.035 --> 06:45.372
>> DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME OR
DO YOU WANT TO LISTEN.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.442
>> DO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, YOU
HAD DAYS TO TALK TO ME AND YOU

06:48.476 --> 06:49.843
CHOSE NOT TO.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.579
YOU DID IT ON LIVE TV.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.582
YOU ARE A COULD YOU AD.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.183
>>-- COW DS ARD.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.350
>> DO YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.

06:57.384 --> 07:03.591
>> GOOD FOR YOU, CHRISTMAS, ARE
YOU SO-- TOUGH.

07:03.624 --> 07:08.295
>> I'M REALLY PISSED OFF, I KNOW
FOR SURE IT IS JOSH.

07:08.328 --> 07:11.732
I KNOW IS HE ONE OF THE
TRAITORS, HE IS A LIARER AND A

07:11.765 --> 07:13.366
SNAKE.

07:13.400 --> 07:18.105
>> WHY ARE YOU-- POINTING AT ME,
WHY ARE YOU BULLYING ME.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.540
>> WHY ARE YOU GRILLING ME?

07:19.573 --> 07:22.309
>> LISTEN, CODY, I THINK YOU ARE
A GREAT GUY BUT YOU DON'T KNOW

07:22.342 --> 07:25.145
ME, DON'T YOU EVER GRILL ME.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.980
>> OKAY.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.717
>> COME ON, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE A GOOD TIME HERE.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.118
>> NO, NO, PLEASE DON'T.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.186
>> NO, COME ON.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.355
>> I NEVER HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT
NICE TO YOU AND I GOT RESPECT

07:35.388 --> 07:37.124
FOR ME BUT DON'T GRILL ME.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.593
>> THIS ISN'T A FIGHT, MAN.

07:39.627 --> 07:40.193
>> WE'RE ON TV.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.662
>> WHY IS HE GRILLING ME?

07:41.695 --> 07:48.435
>> DOESN'T MATTER, DOESN'T
MATTER, DOESN'T MATTER.

07:48.468 --> 07:53.774
>> COMING IN THIS HOH IS
IMPORTANT.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.308
I JUST SURVIVED THE BLOCK BUT I
HAD FOUR OF THOSE AGAINST ME.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.679
NOW I KNOW ONE OF THOSE VOTES
WAS JESSICA.

07:58.712 --> 08:02.516
IF JESSICA GETS IT, I'M
DEFINITELY GOING HOME NEXT WEEK,

08:02.550 --> 08:07.354
THOSE LINES WERE DEFINITELY
DRAWN AND SHE'S OUT FOR BLOOD.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.590
>> I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I
WIN THIS HOH.

08:09.623 --> 08:13.426
CODY'S GUNNING FOR ME FOR NOT
HOLDING HIS-- AND I KNOW JESSICA

08:13.460 --> 08:17.164
IS COMING FOR ME AS WELL SO I
NEED SAFETY TO MAKE MY MOVE

08:17.197 --> 08:20.668
SECURE ANOTHER WEEK FOR MYSELF
AND HAVE CONTROL.

08:20.701 --> 08:26.006
>> GET THE LOLLIPOP.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.376
>> SO IN THIS COMPETITION, WE

08:29.409 --> 08:32.680
CANDY AND FIND THE SILVER
TICKET.

08:32.713 --> 08:37.050
ONCE WE DO, WE CAN EXCHANGE UP

08:37.084 --> 08:38.118
BALLS.

08:38.151 --> 08:41.154

YOU LIKE TO REDEEM.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.355
>> THREE.

08:42.389 --> 08:46.259
>> NOW THAT I HAVE MY BALLS, I
CAN CHOOSE ONE OF THREE GIANT

08:46.293 --> 08:50.631
RAMPS THAT ALL LEAD TO THE SWEET
SUGAR SHOT ON THE CANDY CRUSH

08:50.664 --> 08:51.932
GAME BOARD.

08:51.965 --> 08:57.738
>> THERE'S THE STRAIGHT BUT VERY
NARROW RAMP.

08:57.771 --> 09:03.143
THERE'S AN L-SHAPED RAMP WITH A
TRICKY BANK SHOT.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.613
AND A WICKED CURVE RAMP.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.716
AND THE FIRST PERSON TO MAKE
THEIR BALL INTO THE SUGAR SHOT

09:08.749 --> 09:14.888
WINS HOH.

09:14.922 --> 09:19.559
>> I MISS ON ALL THREE RAMPS SO
IT'S BACK TO THE FRAI.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.594
FIND MORE TICKETS.

09:20.628 --> 09:26.099
>> ALEX, HOW MANY DICTS WOULD
YOU LIKE TO REDEEM.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.300
>> THREE.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.838
>> I DID NOT EXPECT IT THE VOTE
TO GO THAT WAY, I THOUGHT IT

09:30.871 --> 09:41.281
WOULD BE A 6-6 TIE OR A 5-7 VOTE
TO KEEP JILLIAN IN THE HOUSE.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.783
>> MY CIRCLE OF PEOPLE I TRUST
IS GETTING A LOT SMALLER.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.986
EITHER HAVE I TO PULL OUT THIS
HOH WIN, JASON OR KEVIN.

09:46.019 --> 09:50.157
THOSE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE I
TRUST RIGHT NOW.

09:50.190 --> 10:01.168
>> OOPS.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.504
>> GOOD ONE, KEV, GOOD SHOT,
BUDDY.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.741
>> TWO TICKETS.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.944
>> MY ONLY ALLY IN THIS HOUSE
RIGHT NOW IS SITTING OUT.

10:10.978 --> 10:14.682
>> SO I KNOW THAT I HAVE TO PULL
THIS OUT FOR CODY AND I.

10:14.715 --> 10:19.753
RIGHT NOW IT IS
SWLEUTLY-- ABSOLUTELY CODY AND I

10:19.787 --> 10:25.926
VERSUS THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.160
>> THREE.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.830
>> SO MY STRATEGY GOING TOO THIS
GAME IS GOING STRAIGHT FOR THE

10:29.863 --> 10:31.031
CURVE.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.366
I KNOW IF I GET THE RIGHT SPEED
I'M GOING TO GET STRAIGHT IN

10:33.400 --> 10:47.781
THAT HEART.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.617
>> IN THIS COMPETITION WE'RE
ABLE TO STOCK PILE TICKETS AND

10:50.650 --> 10:55.355
HAND THEM OFF TO WHOEVER WE
WANT.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.325
SO WE'RE ALL JUST COLLECTING
TICKETS AND HANDING THEM OFF TO

10:58.358 --> 11:02.863
PAUL SO HE CAN PERFECT HIS SHOT
AND THEN WIN HOH AND TAKE HIS

11:02.896 --> 11:05.598
SHOT AT CODY.

11:05.632 --> 11:09.837
>> THANK YOU.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.706
>> CODY CAN CLEARLY SEE I'M
PASSING OFF TICKETS TO PAUL AND

11:12.740 --> 11:16.910
I JUST USE THE LINE IN THE SAND
FOR US.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.913
>> I'M SEEING THAT IT IS A
LITTLE DANGEROUS FOR ME TO HOP

11:19.947 --> 11:24.051
AROUND SO I'M DITCHING MY
CRUSHES AND I JUST START SLIDING

11:24.084 --> 11:27.320
ON MY BELLY LIKE A BABY SEAL AND
PASSING OFF TICKETS TO PAUL.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.456
>> THANK YOU, BABY GIRL, YOU'RE
DOING GREAT.

11:29.489 --> 11:32.926
>> ALL THESE SUGAR MOMMAS AND
SUGAR DADDIES ARE HANDING MAY

11:32.960 --> 11:36.296
TICKETS TO I CAN BE THE ONE TO
SINK THE SUGAR SHOT IN FOR THE

11:36.329 --> 11:36.629
GROUP.

11:36.663 --> 11:37.697
>> THREE.

11:37.731 --> 11:41.101
>> RIGHT OFF THE BAT I NOTICE
THAT THE STRAIGHT ONE,

11:41.134 --> 11:41.701
IMPOSSIBLE.

11:41.735 --> 11:46.840
THE BANK SHOT, IMPOSSIBLE.

11:46.874 --> 11:56.917
THE CURVE THAT LOOKS THE
HARDEST, THE MOST PROMISING.

11:56.917 --> 12:06.693
THE CURVE THAT LOOKS THE
HARDEST, THE MOST PROMISING.

PUT ME UP.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.914
>> IS THAT HOLE MOVING?

12:26.947 --> 12:31.751
>> IF YOU GET IT IN THIS TOP
SHOOT IT GOES STRAIGHT TO THE

HANDING PAUL THEIR TICKETS, I

12:50.537 --> 12:52.505
JUST NEED TO MAKE ONE BALL IN.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.742
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO STAY

13:33.513 --> 13:36.049
IT GOES RIGHT INTO THE SLOT AND
GOES RIGHT IN.

13:36.083 --> 13:42.255
YOU GOT TO GO FOR THE TOP ONE.

13:42.289 --> 13:48.528
>> I'M TRYING TO GIVE PEOPLE
ADVICE.

13:48.561 --> 13:55.869
I'M NOT REALLY SURE IF THEY'RE
HEARING IT.

13:55.903 --> 14:00.140
I'M BASICALLY HELPLESS IN THIS
HOH COMPETITION.

14:00.173 --> 14:03.443
>> I GOT TO MAKE THIS IN AND
MAKE SURE THAT I GET RID OF CODY

14:03.476 --> 14:17.057

GOING TO BE EVEN SWEETER.

14:34.474 --> 14:39.779
>> PAUL WINS HOH AND I'M FEELING
LIKE I WIN HOH.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.481
CODY'S FACE IS SO UPSET.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.750
JESSICA IS SO MAD.

OF THIS GAME.

15:01.268 --> 15:05.672
EVERYONE JUST GROUPIED UP ON
HIM, UNLESS I CAN PLAY IN THIS

15:05.705 --> 15:08.241
POV COMPETITION, THERE IS
NOTHING THAT I CAN DO.

15:08.275 --> 15:14.181
>> OH, AND THERE'S A TICKET IN
HERE.

15:14.214 --> 15:18.918
>> PAUL WINNING HOH REALLY SUCKS
BECAUSE HE'S THE WORST-CASE

15:18.952 --> 15:19.987
SCENARIO.

15:20.020 --> 15:25.392
I FEEL LIKE I HAD FRIENDS IN
THIS HOUSE AND I DON'T.

15:25.425 --> 15:29.029
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO
MOVE FORWARD RIGHT NOW.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.064
I REALLY CAN'T IMAGINE IT
GETTING ANY WORSE.

15:45.745 --> 15:50.450
>> SO CODY, YOU WANTED TO MAKE A
MAVERICK MOVE AND TAKE ME OUT OF

15:50.483 --> 15:52.986
THIS GAME EARLY AFTER I TRUSTED
YOU.

15:53.020 --> 15:57.290
BUT GUESS WHAT, YOU SHOT, YOU
MISSED AND NOW ITS' MY TURN TO

15:57.324 --> 15:58.992
SHOOT BACK.

15:59.026 --> 16:03.063
>> HEY, CONGRATS, CHRISTMAS, FOR
STAYING IN THIS HOUSE AND BEING

16:03.096 --> 16:04.097
A WARRIOR.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.965
>> THANKS FOR INCLUDING ME, MAN.

16:05.999 --> 16:09.536
>> THERE MIGHT BE SOME SNAKES IN
THIS GAME BUT THERE'S ALSO A

16:09.569 --> 16:10.737
DEVIL.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.906
>> PAUL AND I HAVE THE SAME
EXACT TARGETS, NUMBER ONE CODY.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.876
NUMBER TWO, JESSICA.

16:16.909 --> 16:20.213
AND WE BOTH WANT TO DRAW SOME
BLOOD.

16:20.247 --> 16:25.385
>> THAT IS THE MOST EXERCISE I
HAVE HAD IN FOUR DAYS.

16:25.418 --> 16:29.156
>> I HAVE LEGITIMATELY GOTTEN
BLINDSIDED IN EVERY ASPECT OF

16:29.189 --> 16:30.323
THIS GAME.

16:30.357 --> 16:35.695
SO IF THEY WANT TO PLAY DIRTY I
WILL LIE, BACK STAB, THROW

16:35.728 --> 16:36.796
PEOPLE UNDER THE BUS.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.166

MORE, PAUL IS THE HOH.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.368
THEY WILL PIT US AGAINST EACH
OTHER, IT WILL BE EITHER ME OR

16:41.401 --> 16:42.202
YOU, I GUARANTEE YOU.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.970
>> I DON'T REGRET ANYTHING.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.138
>> I DON'T EITHER.

16:45.172 --> 16:51.211
I KNOW IT WAS YOU CAN YOU,
KEVIN, JASON AND ALEX WHO VOTED

16:51.244 --> 16:54.414
TO KEEP JILLIAN.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.616
>> RAMSES.

16:56.649 --> 17:00.220
>> THAT COWARD, SAME THING WITH
JOSH.

17:00.253 --> 17:00.853

17:06.126 --> 17:08.795
>> I VOTE TO EVICT JILLIAN.

17:08.828 --> 17:13.800
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.034
I'M NOT TELLING NO ONE NOTHING.

17:15.068 --> 17:15.702
INITIALLY I WAS GOING TO VOTE
FOR JILLIAN BUT I'M FRIENDS WITH

17:15.735 --> 17:16.936
CHRISTMAS SO I VOTED FOR HER.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.037
THE GIRL MAKES ME BREAKFAST.

17:18.071 --> 17:21.508
IF THE WOMAN MAKES YOU
BREAKFAST, WITH YOU VOTE FOR

17:21.541 --> 17:22.675
HER.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.245
>> I WAS PRETTY POSITIVE BY
KEVIN'S FACE THAT HE DIDN'T GO

17:25.278 --> 17:28.981
AGAINST HIS WORD, JOSH AND
RAMSES WERE THE ONES THAT LIED.

17:29.015 --> 17:40.627
>> YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOUR OWN,
WIN THINGS, SIMPLE AS THAT.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.496
>> YOU GUYS DON'T THINK I
FLIPPED, DID YOU.

17:43.530 --> 17:43.963
>> YES, YOU DID.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.132
>> I DID NOT.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.466
>> I KNOW EVERYONE WHO FLIPPED
AND EVERYONE WHO DIDN'T, AND

17:46.499 --> 17:48.468
WERE YOU ONE OF THE ONES THAT
FLIP.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.303
>> I VOTE TO EVICT CHRISTMAS.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.372
>> WE COUNT EVERYBODY RIGHT NOW.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.041
>> DUDE, IT MAKES NO SENSE
WHATSOEVER FOR ME TO WANT TO

17:55.074 --> 17:56.343
VOTE OUT JILLIAN.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.411
JILLIAN IS MY BEST FRIEND IN
THIS HOUSE.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.348
WHY THE HECK WOULD I WANT TO
VOTE HER OUT THIS WEEK.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.082
>> ARE YOU STUPID?

18:03.116 --> 18:05.918
>> SO YOU ARE SAYING KEVIN
FLIPPED.

18:05.952 --> 18:09.122
>> THAT'S WHY I'M CONFUSED
BECAUSE I DID NOT.

18:09.156 --> 18:12.325
>> EVERYBODY KNEW I WAS VOTING
TO EVICT CHRISTMAS.

18:12.359 --> 18:15.828
AND I'M NOT-- I DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO TELL ANYBODY, CHRISTMAS KNOWS

18:15.862 --> 18:16.896
HERSELF.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.898
>> FRANKLY, RAMSES, I DON'T EVEN
WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.066
THERE IS NO SENSE.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.770
AND IT DOESN'T DO YOU ANY GOOD
TO TALK GAME WITH US EITHER,

18:23.803 --> 18:24.171
SO.

18:24.204 --> 18:32.379

BETWEEN ME AND CODY AFTER THE

18:39.619 --> 18:40.820
EVICTION.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.622
SO I WANT TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I
DON'T WANT ANY MORE TENSION OR

18:42.655 --> 18:43.890

HE'S A CONSTANT VICTIM, MAKING
VICTIM NOISES.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.510
AND NOW HE'S A TRAITOR.

YOUR FRIENDS DOES, DUDE, IT'S

23:20.700 --> 23:23.636
UNBELIEVABLE IT HAD TO COME TO
THIS BNS DID YOU SEE THAT, DID

23:23.670 --> 23:26.038
YOU SEE HOW BEAUTIFULFULLY THAT
ALL HAPPENED.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.474
>> CODY, YOU ARE A HOT HEAD.

23:27.507 --> 23:32.211
YOU DID EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.446
YOU SHOWED YOUR TRUE COLORS.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.280
SO IF SOMEBODY TRIES TO BITE ME,
I GOT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT

23:34.313 --> 23:37.216
THERE THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO BITE
AGAIN.

23:37.249 --> 23:37.917
GOOD LUCK, BUDDY.

23:37.950 --> 23:43.856
>> I WANT TO GO TO WAR WITH YOU.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.892
>> NAH.

23:45.925 --> 23:51.998
>> WHO WANTS TO SEE MY HOH ROOM!

23:52.031 --> 23:54.501
COME ON, DUCK LINGS.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.102
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO
THIS.

23:56.135 --> 24:03.175
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THIS.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.678
>> THERE HE IS.

24:05.712 --> 24:11.784
WHERE IS DR.
JESS IS IN THE DR.

24:11.818 --> 24:12.585
>> YEAH.

24:12.619 --> 24:13.152
>> WHAT?

24:13.185 --> 24:15.555
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

24:15.588 --> 24:16.889
>> ARE YOU SURE?

24:16.923 --> 24:19.959
>> IF THEY WANT TO PUT ME UP AND
GET ME OUT OF THE HOUSE, GO FOR

24:19.992 --> 24:23.663
IT BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SIT IN A
ROOM WITH ALL OF THEM.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.131
>> SHOULD WE WAIT.

24:25.164 --> 24:33.305
>> LIKE GIVE ME A BREAK.

24:33.339 --> 24:37.577
>> WHERE IS THE BEARDLESS PHOTO,
COME ON, PAUL!

24:37.610 --> 24:38.244
>> THAT'S BLAIR.

24:38.277 --> 24:38.978
>> I LOVE HER.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.613
>> IS THAT YOUR SISTER.

24:40.647 --> 24:44.917
>> THAT'S MY SISTER.

24:44.951 --> 24:47.654
>> YEAH, I GOT.

24:47.687 --> 24:53.092
>> I'M SO JEALOUS.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.328
>> LET'S READ THIS SUCKER.

24:56.362 --> 24:59.165
>> ARE YOU GOING TO CRY?

24:59.198 --> 24:59.899
>> PROBABLY.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.100
>> HELLO, MY BOY.

25:01.133 --> 25:07.106
AS YOU CAN GUESS, THE HOUSE IS
VERY QUIET, CRICKET, CRICKET.

25:07.139 --> 25:11.944
MISS YOU SO MUCH AND I BET THAT
YOU MISS HEARING, PAUL!

25:11.978 --> 25:14.981
EVERY DAY.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.749
LOVE YOU AND AM PROUD OF YOU.

25:16.783 --> 25:20.553
BEHAVE, ALWAYS STAY TRUE TO
YOURSELF, AND NO HUMPING, LOVE

25:20.587 --> 25:25.124
AND KISSES, EVERYONE.

25:25.157 --> 25:34.533
>> AWKWARD.

25:34.567 --> 25:39.706
>> AWKWARD.

25:39.739 --> 25:43.542
>> LAST WEEK CODY LEFT EVERYONE
IN THE DARK AND IT REALLY UPSET

25:43.576 --> 25:44.443
EVERYBODY.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.078
SO I'M GOING TO DO THE COMPLETE
OPPOSITE.

25:46.112 --> 25:51.183
NO SECRETS, NO BS, NOTHING TO
HIDE, JUST A SOLID STRATEGY.

25:51.217 --> 25:57.489
>> SO WHAT I AM THINKING OF
DOING IS PUTTING MATT AND RAVEN

25:57.523 --> 26:02.629
UP AS PAWNS.

26:02.662 --> 26:05.598
>> I'M THINKING RAVEN AND MATT
ARE GOOD PAWNS TO PUT ON THE

26:05.632 --> 26:08.134
BLOCK BECAUSE I TRUST THEM, I
KNOW THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GUN

26:08.167 --> 26:12.004
IT FOR THIS VETO AS HARD AS I
AM, AND IF WE WIN THE VETO I CAN

26:12.038 --> 26:16.876
PULL MATT OFF AND REPLACE HIM
WITH CODY, AND IF CODY IS UP ON

26:16.909 --> 26:21.380
THE BLOCK AGAINST RAVEN, THERE
IS NO CHANCE ANYBODY IS VOTING

26:21.413 --> 26:24.150
THAT SWEET LITTLE ANGLE RAVEN
OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

26:24.183 --> 26:27.519
>> I JUST DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED
TO RISK EVEN PUT RAVEN OR MYSELF

26:27.553 --> 26:30.857
UP THERE, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
HE HAS THE VOTES TO DO ANYTHING.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.559
>> I'M DEFINITELY WILLING TO GO
UP AS A PAWN IF THAT IS WHAT IS

26:33.592 --> 26:34.794
BEST FOR THE TEAM.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.596
BUT SOMETIMES PAWNS CAN GO HOME
EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT MEANT TO.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.666
>> I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT THAT
TO BE ME.

26:39.699 --> 26:53.445
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE MINIMALIST IS
TAKING FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

26:53.479 --> 26:54.580
>> BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T
JEOPARDIZE ANYBODY ON THIS SIDE.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.082
>> WE HAVE SIX PEOPLE IN HERE.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.817
THAT ARE VOTING TO GET CODY OUT.

26:57.850 --> 27:01.353
THE ONLY REASON YOU LOSE THE
NUMBERS IS IF ONE OF US ARE ON

27:01.387 --> 27:02.388
THE BLOCK.

27:02.421 --> 27:05.925
IF NONE OF US ARE BE O THE
BLOCK, THAT'S SIX VOTES.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.961
>> ALL THE TEMPTATIONS, I DONE
FEEL SAFE GOING ON THE BLOCK

27:30.416 --> 27:34.053
>> AND THE GIRLS ARE-- WE'RE
GOING, WE'RE GOING.

27:34.086 --> 27:41.060
>> HOUSEGUESTS, IT'S TIME TO
RETURN TO THE DEN OF TEMPTATION.

27:41.093 --> 27:45.164
>> DEN OF TEMPTATION, I KNEW IT.

27:45.197 --> 27:49.902
>> AMERICA'S BEEN VOTING ALL

27:49.936 --> 27:54.006
WEEK TO TEMPT A NEW HOUSEGUEST
INSIDE OF DEN OF TEMPTATION.

27:54.040 --> 27:57.609
ONE AT A TIME WE WILL REENTER
THE DEN WHERE WE WILL BE TOLD IN

27:57.643 --> 28:00.713
SECRET IF WE ARE BEING TEMPTED
OR NOT, AND REMEMBER THE

28:00.747 --> 28:03.783
TEMPTATION IS ACCEPTED, IT WILL
UNLEASH A CONSEQUENCE ON THE

28:03.816 --> 28:04.951
HOUSE.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.919
SINCE I HAVE ALREADY BEEN
TEMPTED, I WILL NOT BE ENTERING

28:06.953 --> 28:09.021
THE DEN.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.323
FEEL FREE TO POV ABOUT THE HOUSE
WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN YOU WILL BE

28:11.357 --> 28:12.058
SUMMONED TO THE DEN.

28:12.091 --> 28:17.997
GOOD LUCK.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.599
>> NEW IF THE POLICE COME IN, BY
THE TIME THEY GET FROM THE DOOR

28:20.632 --> 28:22.168
TO THE.

28:22.201 --> 28:22.701
>> RAMSES.

28:22.735 --> 28:23.369
>> TO THE PHONE BOOTH.

28:23.402 --> 28:29.909
>> YOU MAY NOW ENTER THE DEN.

28:29.942 --> 28:43.856
>> OH STOP IT.

28:43.890 --> 28:44.991
>> NO!

28:45.024 --> 28:52.331
>> I WALK INTO THE DEN OF
TEMPTATION AND I SEE FRICKING

28:52.364 --> 28:57.469
VOO DO DOLLS OF ALL OF THE
HOUSEGUESTS WITH STICKSES AND

28:57.503 --> 28:59.305
CREEPY THINGS POKING OUT OF OUR
BODIES.

28:59.338 --> 29:02.141
AND MINE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE ME.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.410
>> WHAT THE HECK!

29:04.443 --> 29:09.648
WHICH IS FREAKING CREEPY.

29:09.681 --> 29:17.890
>> SORRY, AMERICA HAS CHOSEN NOT
TO TEMPT YOU THIS WEEK.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.391
>> QUOOL COOL, THANKS.

29:19.425 --> 29:20.526
>> SICK.

29:20.559 --> 29:28.300
>> SORRY, AMERICA HAS CHOSEN NOT
TO TEMPT YOU THIS WEEK.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.435
>> NO!

29:29.468 --> 29:31.137
IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY IS
GETTING STABBED IN THE FRONT.

29:31.170 --> 29:35.942
>> I DONE KNOW WHAT THIS
TEMPTATION IS BUT IF IT IS-- I

29:35.975 --> 29:38.444
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT I REALLY
HOPE AMERICA TELLED ME THIS WEEK

29:38.477 --> 29:42.314
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR
MY GAME.

29:42.348 --> 29:45.151
>> SORRY, AMERICA HAS CHOSEN NOT
TO TEMPT YOU THIS WEEK.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.486
THANKS AGAIN, GUYS.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.755
>> SORRY, AMERICA HAS CHOSEN NOT
TO.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.923
>> TEMPT YOU THIS WEEK.

29:50.957 --> 29:51.623
>> SORRY.

29:51.657 --> 29:53.025
>> SORRY.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.160
>> WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

29:54.193 --> 29:57.830
>> YOU GAVE ME BIG BOOBS ON THIS
THING.

29:57.864 --> 30:00.466
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS
TEMPTATION IS.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.903
BUT I WILL TAKE ANYTHING AT THIS
POINT TO KEEP CODY AND I IN THIS

30:03.936 --> 30:04.603
GAME TOGETHER.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.872
WE ARE DESPERATE.

30:05.905 --> 30:09.275
WE'RE DOWNING AND I'M PRAYING
THAT AMERICA WANTS TO KEEP US IN

30:09.308 --> 30:13.679
THIS GAME AND VOTE TO GIVE US
THIS TEMPTATION.

30:13.712 --> 30:23.755
>> SORRY, AMERICA HAS CHOSEN NOT
TO TEMPT YOU THIS WEEK.

30:23.755 --> 30:33.765
>> SORRY, AMERICA HAS CHOSEN NOT
TO TEMPT YOU THIS WEEK.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.512
>> CON GRATED LAIRGSESES,
CHRISTMAS, AMERICA HAS CHOSE

30:46.545 --> 30:52.851
TONE TELL YOU WITH THE RING OF
RE-- THANK YOU, AMERICA.

30:52.885 --> 30:55.521
ACCEPT THIS TEMPTATION AND THE
RING OF REPLACEMENT WILL LET YOU

30:55.554 --> 30:59.125
PLAY IN ANY ONE VETO COMPETITION
YOU CHOOSE THIS SUMMER.

30:59.158 --> 31:02.261
THAT MEANS YOU MAY CHOOSE ONE
HOUSEGUEST THAT YOU WANT TO

31:02.294 --> 31:06.232
REPLACE FROM THE PLAYER SELECTED
BY WEARING IT.

31:06.265 --> 31:09.668
ONCE YOU USE IT, THE POWER IS
GONE FOR THE REST OF THE SUMMER.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.071
NO ONE WILL KNOW YOU HAVE
ACCEPTED THIS TEMPTATION UNTIL

31:12.104 --> 31:14.006
YOU REVEAL THE RING'S POWER.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.408
OTHERWISE THE SECRET IS YOURS TO
KEEP.

31:16.442 --> 31:19.211
SO REMEMBER, EVERY TEMPTATION
COMESES WITH A CONSEQUENCE.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.013
SO DO YOU ACCEPT THE TEMPTATION?

31:21.047 --> 31:23.282
>> THIS TEMPTATION IS A GAMBLE.

31:23.315 --> 31:28.520
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE UNKNOWN,
AND THEY COULD BE HUGE.

31:28.554 --> 31:32.391
BUT I'M GOING TO DIVE IN WITH
SOME FAITH.

31:32.424 --> 31:41.133
>> I CHOOSE TO ACCEPT THIS
TEMPTATION.

31:41.167 --> 31:46.205
>> OKAY.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.608
>> IN ORDER TO RELEASE THE POWER
OF THE RING OF REPLACEMENT YOU

31:49.641 --> 31:53.879
MUST CURSE THREE OF YOUR HOUSE
MATES BY TURNING THEM INTO

31:53.912 --> 31:59.485
VETTEDOS FOR THE WEEK, CHOOSE
THE VOODOO DOLLS OF THE THREE

31:59.518 --> 32:03.489
HOUSEGUESTS TO TURN TOO.

32:03.522 --> 32:06.092
>> THE CURSE WILL BE REVEALED TO
THE SELECTED HOUSEGUESTS IN DUE

32:06.125 --> 32:07.193
TIME.

32:07.226 --> 32:08.794
>> I MADE MY LIST AND AM
CHECKING IT TWICE, THERE ARE A

32:08.827 --> 32:11.897
FEW PEOPLE GOING TO THE NAUGHTY
LIST TODAY.

32:11.930 --> 32:21.240
I SELECT JASON, FOR THE CURSE.

32:21.273 --> 32:30.782
I SELECT CODY FOR THE CURSE.

32:30.816 --> 32:33.152
I SELECT JESSICA.

32:33.185 --> 32:43.229
FOR THE CURSE.

32:43.229 --> 32:49.268
FOR THE CURSE.

32:49.301 --> 32:55.174
>> SORRY, AMERICA HAS CHOSEN NOT
TO TEMPT YOU THIS WEEK.

32:55.207 --> 32:56.275
>> DAMN.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.277
>> I WALK INTO THE DEN OF
TEMPTATION, I LOOK AROUND, I

32:58.310 --> 32:59.911
DON'T CARE.

32:59.945 --> 33:05.584
I'M NOT INTO DOLLS.

33:05.617 --> 33:15.861
SORRY, AMERICA HAS CHOSEN NOT TO
TEMPT YOU THIS WEEK.

33:15.894 --> 33:20.099
>> YOU THINK THE TEMPTEE GETS TO
CHOOSE WHO GETS CURSED.

33:20.132 --> 33:23.335
>> OH YEAH, FOR SURE, BECAUSE
WHY WOULD THEY HAVE OUR DOLLS

33:23.369 --> 33:24.603
THERE.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.772
>> I KNOW THAT I DIDN'T GET THAT
TEMPTATION, THAT MEANS SOMEBODY

33:26.805 --> 33:27.239
ELSE DID.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.075
IT IS OUT THERE.

33:29.108 --> 33:33.079
AND THE LAST THING I WANT IS
SOMEONE TO DO SOME VOODOO MAGIC

33:33.112 --> 33:40.286
AND PUT A VOODOO CURSE ON THIS
COWBOY.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.154
>> WELL, WE'RE GETTING CURSED.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.389
>> YEAH.

33:43.422 --> 33:46.558
>> AMERICA DECIDED NOT TO CHOOSE
US FOR THE DEN OF TEMPTATION.

33:46.592 --> 33:50.929
AND AT THIS POINT, THE ONLY
THING THAT COULD GET WORSE IS IF

33:50.962 --> 33:54.833
WHATEVER PUNISHMENT IT IS, LANDS
ON CODY AND I.

33:54.866 --> 34:01.039
>> THIS HOUSE IS TAKING FIVE
YEARS OFF MY LIFE.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.309
>> THIS WEAK HAS BEEN COMPLETELY
NUTS.

34:03.342 --> 34:06.378
WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHO
HAS THIS TEMPTATION.

34:06.412 --> 34:13.185
BUT I AM JUST REALLY HOPING THAT
IT DOESN'T BLOW UP OUR GAME.

34:13.219 --> 34:19.125
>> THAT IS ALL I REALLY CARE
ABOUT.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.326
>> UH-HUH.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.394
>> I'VE GOT AN A PLUS PLAN TO
GET CODY OUT OF THIS HOUSE AND

34:22.428 --> 34:25.864
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD SCREW
THIS UP IS THE DEN OF TEMPTATION

34:25.897 --> 34:29.668
IT COULD POTENTIALLY THROW A
WRENCH IN MY PLAN, AND ALL MY

34:29.701 --> 34:30.736
PLANS WILL BE SOILED.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.638
AND SO WILL MY PANTS.

34:32.671 --> 34:35.073
>> WHAT COULD THE TEMPTATION BE.

34:35.107 --> 34:37.109
>> WE'LL NEVER KNOW THAT.

34:51.089 --> 34:56.995
>> TO BE HONEST, I DON'T WANT
THIS SPOT OF TWO OF OUR OWN.

34:57.028 --> 34:59.898
>> PAUL WANTS TO BACK DOOR CODY
AND I LOVE THE IDEA BUT PUTTING

34:59.931 --> 35:02.934
UP MATT AND RAVEN IS AN
UNNECESSARY RISK WE DON'T NEED

35:02.968 --> 35:04.136
TO TAKE AT THIS MOMENT.

35:04.170 --> 35:06.905
>> YOU WERE RIGHT, YOU MADE A
GREAT POINT, I DIDN'T THINK OF

35:06.938 --> 35:11.443
IT FROM THAT ANGLE.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.913
>> ITS I DON'T WANT TO GAMMABLE
WITH MY OWN PEOPLE.

35:14.946 --> 35:20.786
>> I THINK THE BEST BET IS TO
PUT ALEX, IF YOU TRULY TRUST

35:20.819 --> 35:22.020
SHE.

35:22.053 --> 35:23.889
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I GET IT, WHY
PUT MY PEOPLE IN DANGER WHEN I

35:23.922 --> 35:25.090
DON'T HAVE TO.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.194
EVEN THOUGH I'M CONFIDENT WITH
MY PLAN, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE

35:28.227 --> 35:29.595
ANYBODY UNCOMFORTABLE.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.129
AND I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO GO
WRONG.

35:31.163 --> 35:34.233
SO MAYBE I GOT TO FIGURE
SOMETHING ELSE OUT.

35:34.266 --> 35:36.602
>> BEFORE I MAKE ANYTHING,
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE ON THE

35:36.635 --> 35:37.769
SAME PAGE.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.971
>> I KNOW, THAT I TRUST YOU 100
PERCENT, I'M NOT WORRIED.

35:40.005 --> 35:52.818
>> THANK YOU, I LOVE YOU, BUDDY.

35:52.851 --> 35:56.322
>> I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
YOU AND I FURTHERING OUR GAME.

35:56.355 --> 36:00.292
WHATEVER SWEET DEAL CODY IS
PROMISING YOU, PEOPLE DON'T LIKE

36:00.326 --> 36:01.393
HIM.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.429
EVERYBODY IS ON BOARD WITH BACK
DOORING HIM THIS WEEK.

36:03.462 --> 36:04.663
>> YEAH.

36:04.696 --> 36:07.733
>> ALL ABOUT TO UNLEASH PHASE
ONE OF OPERATION GET CODY OUT OF

36:07.766 --> 36:09.000
THIS HOUSE.

36:09.034 --> 36:13.872
FIRST I NEED TO CONVINCE ALEX TO
BE ON MY SIDE, WORK WITH ME AND

36:13.905 --> 36:17.476
BE ONE OF MY PAWNS THIS WEEK SO
THAT WE CAN GO AFTER CODY AND

36:17.509 --> 36:20.546
BLINDSIDE HIM, THE SAME WAY HE
BLINDSIDED US LAST WEEK.

36:20.579 --> 36:25.784
>> I WANT HIM OUT THIS WEEK.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.052
THIS IS MY AGENDA.

36:27.085 --> 36:28.254
IF I PUT JESSICA AND CODY ON THE
BLOCK, THEY BOTH COMPETE IN THE

36:28.287 --> 36:29.455
POV GUARANTEED.

36:29.488 --> 36:32.324
CODY IS EXPECTED TO BE BACK
DOORED AND THAT IS WHAT IS GOING

36:32.358 --> 36:33.124
TO HAPPEN.

36:33.158 --> 36:34.826
I'M GOING TO BACK DOOR HIM.

36:34.860 --> 36:35.961
>> OKAY.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.796
>> I WOULD RATHER HAVE TWO
STRONG PEOPLE COMPETE AND KEEP

36:37.829 --> 36:41.733
POT WE ARE WHERE IT NEEDS TO
BEMENT NOW LISTEN TO MY PLAN.

36:41.767 --> 36:45.103
IF YOU ARE ONE OF MY PAWNS, I
PUT YOU UP.

36:45.136 --> 36:47.873
I PUT YOU NEXT TO SOMEONE LIKE
JOSH.

36:47.906 --> 36:51.410
IF I WIN THAT VETO, I PUT IT
OVER YOUR NECK AND SAY ALEX,

36:51.443 --> 36:54.680
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION,
CODY, CHECK MATE.

36:54.713 --> 36:58.284
>> I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO
ALONG WITH THIS BUT I HAVE TO.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.952
THE NUMBERS WITHIN THE OTHER
SIDE ARE TOO GREAT NOW.

37:00.986 --> 37:05.190
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TARGET
JESSICA AND HAVE TO TARGET CODY.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.625
IT'S THE ONLY WAY CAN I SAVE
MYSELF.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.328
RIGHT NOW MY BACK IS UP AGAINST
A WALL.

37:09.361 --> 37:12.831
>> JOSH HATES CODY.

37:12.864 --> 37:13.932
LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.166
>> HE'S A LOOSE CANON.

37:15.200 --> 37:19.671
>> HE'S A LOOSE CANON BEFORE BUT
AFTER WHAT CODY DID TO HIM AND

37:19.705 --> 37:23.775
HUMILIATE HIM FROM FRONT OF
EVERYONE, WE NEVER PICK CODY TO

37:23.809 --> 37:25.777
COMPETE AND JOSH WANTS TO BE
PART OF GETTING CODY OUT OF THIS

37:25.811 --> 37:26.978
GAME.

37:27.012 --> 37:30.316
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED ME
FIRST INSTEAD OF BLINDSIDING ME

37:30.349 --> 37:31.717
LIKE CODY DID.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.853
>> TO WIN THIS IS LUCK AND
CHANCE TO GET FAR IT IS

37:34.886 --> 37:35.454
STRATEGY.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.455
I THINK IT'S A GOOD PLAN.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.790
>> I THINK IT'S A GOOD PLAN.

37:38.824 --> 37:41.159
>> SURPRISINGLY, ALEX IS TAKING
THIS IDEA SUPERWELL.

37:41.192 --> 37:42.894
SHE SEEMS TO REALLY TRUST ME.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.396
AND SHE WANTS TO GET CODY OUT.

37:44.430 --> 37:55.941
SO THOSE ARE ALL CHECKS IN MY
BOOK.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.709
>> SO HERE'S THE GAME PLAN.

37:57.743 --> 38:00.245
AND I MIGHT NEED YOUR HELP,
OKAY.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.014
>> PHASE TWO OF OPERATION GET
CODY OUT OF HERE.

38:03.048 --> 38:07.052
I NEED TO CONVINCE JOSH TO ALSO
GO UP OS A PAWN AND BE PLAYING

38:07.085 --> 38:10.356
FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF GETTING
CODY OUT OF THIS GAME AND

38:10.389 --> 38:12.324
GETTING HIS SWEET REVENGE.

38:12.358 --> 38:19.197
>> SO THE PLAN HERE IS CODY GOES
HOME, THIS IS MY PLAN.

38:19.230 --> 38:23.735
THE PLAN IS FLAWLESS, DOG.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.203
>> OH, IT'S ABOUT TO GET KEEP
CREEPEE.

38:25.236 --> 38:29.908
>> I CONVINCED ALEX TO BE A
PAWN.

38:29.941 --> 38:30.809
I NEED ANOTHER PAWN.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.478
I DON'T WANT EVEN CODY TO PLAY
IN THE VETO.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.679
>> I DON'T WANT.

38:33.712 --> 38:37.282
>> YOU DO THOUGH, IN THE OFF
CHANCE CODY GETS PICKED TO PLAY

38:37.315 --> 38:43.855
VETO AND WE DON'T WANT HIM TO
WIN, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST

38:43.889 --> 38:47.158
CALL THIS THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE
VETO COMPETITION.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.360
>> PAUL, YOU'RE BAD.

38:48.394 --> 38:53.198
>> BUT YOU FOA I'M RIGHTMENT YOU
SEE HOW PISSED YOU MADE HIM?

38:53.231 --> 38:54.332
>> YES, UH-HUH.

38:54.366 --> 38:57.736
>> IF YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH IT, YOU CAN SAY NO.

38:57.769 --> 39:00.372
>> I BETTER NOT GO HOME.

39:00.406 --> 39:01.673
>> DOG, I PROMISE.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.274
>> I NEVER QUESTIONED YOU.

39:03.308 --> 39:05.511
>> DOG, I WILL NOT LET THAT
HAPPEN.

39:05.544 --> 39:09.280
MY TARGET IS CODY.

39:09.314 --> 39:12.984
>> IF ANYBODY ELSE ASKED ME TO
BE A PAWN I WOULD SHUT IT DOWN

39:13.018 --> 39:14.720
RIGHT AWAY AM BUT YOU KNOW,
EVERYTHING THAT PAUL HAS TOLL ME

39:14.753 --> 39:18.156
IN THIS GAME HAS HELPED ME AND I
KIND OF TRUST HIM AT THIS POINT.

39:18.189 --> 39:21.527
I THINK THAT BY DOING THIS IT
COULD EITHER BURN ME AND I CAN

39:21.560 --> 39:24.463
GO HOME OR THIS CAN BE A MOMENT
TO SHOW PAUL THAT I'M LOYAL TO

39:24.496 --> 39:27.065
HIM AND WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER
IN ORDER TO FURTHER OUR GAME AND

39:27.098 --> 39:29.568
TO FURTHER MY GAME.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.670
>> LET'S DO IT.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.072
>> JOSH IS TAKING THIS VERY,
VERY WELL.

39:34.105 --> 39:38.444
I DON'T KNOW WHY ALL THESE
PEOPLE HAVE SO MUCH TRUST IN ME.

39:38.477 --> 39:41.747
JUST GETTING, I KNOW WHY,
BECAUSE CODY PRETTY MUCH SCREWED

39:41.780 --> 39:43.782
OVER EVERYBODY IN THIS HOUSE.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.817
>> 1 BILLION PERCENT I WILL MAKE
SURE CODY GOES HOME.

39:54.259 --> 39:56.695
> IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA'S
VOTE,

39:56.728 --> 39:59.798
YOU CAN VOTE TO TEMPT THE
HOUSEGUEST OF YOUR CHOICE INSIDE

39:59.831 --> 40:03.301
THE DEN OF TEMPTATION.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.671
EACH TEMPTATION OFFERS AN
ADVANTAGE THAT CAN HELP THEM IN

40:05.704 --> 40:09.140
THE GAME BUT REMEMBER, IT ALSO
COMES WITH A CONSEQUENCE THAT

40:09.174 --> 40:11.843
WILL AFFECT ONE OR MORE OF THEIR
HOUSE MATES.

40:11.877 --> 40:17.983
THE THIRD TEMPTATION IS THE
HALTING HEX.

40:18.016 --> 40:26.324
WITHOUT DO YOU WANT TO RECEIVE
THIS WEEK'S TEMPTATION GO TO

40:26.357 --> 40:31.830
CBS.COM/DT VOTE.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.031
REMEMBER, A HOUSEGUEST CAN ONLY
BE TEMPTED INSIDE THE DEN OF

40:33.064 --> 40:43.108
TEMPTATION ONCE SO CHOOSE WISELY
. WITHIN LAST WEEK I WAS

40:43.108 --> 40:51.116
TEMPTATION ONCE SO CHOOSE WISELY
. WITHIN LAST WEEK I WAS

40:51.149 --> 40:52.884
BIT BY THE SNAKE IN THE DEN OF
TEMPTATION.

40:52.918 --> 40:57.355
THIS MEANS I WAS CURSED AND HAVE
TO PUT MYSELF AS A THIRD NOMINEE

40:57.388 --> 40:58.890
IN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS.

40:58.924 --> 41:02.227
RIGHT NOW I'M THINKING THE PLAN
IS TO EVICT CODY THIS WEEK SO

41:02.260 --> 41:05.430
THE PROS OF GOING ON THE BLOCK
ARE THAT CODY AND JESSICA ARE A

41:05.463 --> 41:06.965
BIGGER TARGET THAN MYSELF.

41:06.998 --> 41:11.002
THE CONS ARE THAT I AM ON THE
BLOCK PERIOD.

41:11.036 --> 41:25.216
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD USE MY
CURSE THIS WEEK OR NOT.

41:25.250 --> 41:29.320
MY GOAL THIS WEEK IS TO BACK
DOOR CODY.

41:29.354 --> 41:31.222
>> HI, EVERYONE, TIME FOR THE
NOMINATION CODY.

41:31.256 --> 41:34.225
>> YOU STABBED WAY TOO MANY
PEOPLE IF THE BACK AND

41:34.259 --> 41:36.828
ESPECIALLY YOU BLEW UP MY
FRIENDSHIP SO GUESS WHAT, BUDDY,

41:36.862 --> 41:39.898
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE REVENGE AND
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

41:39.931 --> 41:42.267
DON'T COME BACK.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.802
THIS IS THE NOMINATION CEREMONY.

41:43.835 --> 41:47.105
IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE

41:47.138 --> 41:57.048
TWO HOUSEGUESTS FOR EVICTION.

41:57.082 --> 41:59.685
ACTUALLY.

41:59.718 --> 42:02.621
>> SO LAST WEEK INSIDE OF THE
DEN OF TEMPTATION I WAS BITEN BY

42:02.654 --> 42:03.655
THE SNAKE.

42:03.689 --> 42:07.425
AND RECEIVED A NOMINATION CURSE.

42:07.458 --> 42:12.363
THE CURSE FORCES ME TO PUT
MYSELF ON THE BLOCK AS A THIRD

42:12.397 --> 42:13.331
NOMINEE.

42:13.364 --> 42:14.499
AT ONE OF THE NEXT THREE
NOMINATION CEREMONIES.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.435
MI USING THIS CEREMONY TO
NOMINATE MYSELF FOR EVICTION AS

42:17.468 --> 42:21.506
A SPECIAL THIRD NOMINEE.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.075
>> I WOULD PLAY IN THE VETO
COMPETITION LIKE THE OTHER

42:24.109 --> 42:26.912
NOMINEES AND IF I WIN THE VETO
AND TAKE MYSELF DOWN, THERE WILL

42:26.945 --> 42:29.280
NOT BE A REPLACEMENT NOMINEE FOR
ME.

42:29.314 --> 42:32.450
THERE WILL ONLY BE A REPLACEMENT
IF ONE OF PAUL'S TWO NOMINEES

42:32.483 --> 42:33.585
COME DOWN.

42:33.619 --> 42:36.755
PAUL, YOU STILL HAVE TO NOMINATE
TWO MORE HOUSEGUESTS FOR

42:36.788 --> 42:37.889
EVICTION.

42:37.923 --> 42:46.197
YOU MAY PROCEED. IN MY
NOMINATION BLOCK ARE THE KEYS OF

42:46.231 --> 42:49.668
THE HOUSE GUEST I'M NOMINATING
FOR EVICTION.

42:49.701 --> 42:53.605
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO LOCK IN
MY NOMINATION AND THE FACES WILL

42:53.639 --> 42:55.040
APPEAR ON THE MEMORY WALL.

42:55.073 --> 43:07.719
FIRST HOUSEGUEST HAVE I
NOMINATED IS.

43:07.753 --> 43:17.796
THE NEXT HOUSEGUEST HAVE I
NOMINATED IS.

43:17.796 --> 43:23.501
THE NEXT HOUSEGUEST HAVE I
NOMINATED IS.

43:23.534 --> 43:27.338
>> I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, JUSH,
AND YOU ALEX.

43:27.372 --> 43:35.246
JOSH, ARE YOU A LITTLE BIT WILD,
YOU CALLED ME MEATBALL LIKE 30

43:35.280 --> 43:36.447
TIMES.

43:36.481 --> 43:38.016
YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN THE TIME TO
MAKE A GENUINE CONNECTION WITH

43:38.049 --> 43:44.189
ME, THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

43:44.222 --> 43:48.894
>> I JUST NOMINATED THIS AND
CODY AND JESSICA ARE NOT

43:48.927 --> 43:50.095
NOMINATED.

43:50.128 --> 43:52.898
IT'S KIND OF SKETCHY, IF I DON'T
WIN THIS VETO I PRAY TO THE

43:52.931 --> 43:55.600
WORLD ALMIGHTY THAT THERE IS A
BACK DOOR PLAN TO GET CODY OUT

43:55.633 --> 43:57.235
OR ELSE I COULD DEFINITELY BE
SCREWED.

43:57.268 --> 43:59.671
>> I ALREADY KNOW PAUL'S
NOMINATION ARE BS.

43:59.705 --> 44:02.407
HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE IS
GOING IT BACK DOOR ME.

44:02.440 --> 44:04.442
IT'S ALL A SHOW.

44:04.475 --> 44:07.345
BUT IF YOU PLAY IN THE POWER OF
VETO I WILL COME BACK WITH A

44:07.378 --> 44:07.879
VENGEANCE.

44:07.913 --> 44:09.147
>> THIS REALLY SUCKS.

44:09.180 --> 44:12.650
I JUST HAVE TO HOPE THAT EITHER
MY NAME, CODY'S NAME OR BOTH OUR

44:12.684 --> 44:16.187
NAMES GET DRAWN FOR VETO AND WE
CAN KEEP NOMS THE SAME.

44:16.221 --> 44:18.389
>> LAST WEEK THE TEMPTATION
SAVED MY GAME.

44:18.423 --> 44:22.160
BUT THIS WEEK, THE CURSE OF
RAMSES COULD VERY WELL RUIN IT

44:22.193 --> 44:26.164
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD GO
WRONG HERE IS IF RAMSEST WINS

44:26.197 --> 44:27.766
THE VETO, PULLS HIMSELF OFF.

44:27.799 --> 44:32.904
I AM NOT ALLOWED TO REPLACE THE
NOMINEE, AKA PUT CODY ON THE

44:32.938 --> 44:35.373
BLOCK WHICH MEANS ONE OF MY
PAWNS GOES HOME AND OPERATION

44:35.406 --> 44:39.310
GET CODY OUT IS A TOTAL FAILURE.

44:39.344 --> 44:42.647
>> WHO WILL WIN THE POWER OF
VETO AND WILL IT BE USED TO SAVE

44:42.680 --> 44:45.817
EITHER ALEX, JOSH OR RAMSES FROM
EVICTION?

44:45.851 --> 44:55.693
