M_I_SForEver

00:41.272 --> 00:43.139
Whoa...

00:44.371 --> 00:47.039
Incredible!

00:47.073 --> 00:51.007
I didn't know there was
a dungeon underneath our town.

00:55.405 --> 00:59.438
Well, let's look.
What do we have here?

00:59.471 --> 01:01.873
Pyramid construction?

01:01.906 --> 01:04.572
Uh, I doubt
that'll be useful.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.605
Riding seahorses?

01:06.639 --> 01:09.040
Well, no one
will be really impressed.

01:10.038 --> 01:11.339
What is this?

01:11.372 --> 01:14.139
Looks like...

01:14.172 --> 01:16.171
a blow or something.

01:16.204 --> 01:18.873
Unbelievable!

01:18.906 --> 01:22.506
It's the secret punch that
tears holes in the walls!

01:22.539 --> 01:25.007
It's absolute pure magic!

at the Dolph-cathlon?

02:15.939 --> 02:19.239
Oh, hello! Nope,
I had serious business to attend to.

02:19.271 --> 02:22.939
Don't tell me you
discovered underwater aliens again.

02:24.205 --> 02:27.472

02:49.371 --> 02:53.104
No problem, Delphi.
Did you see the match?

02:53.138 --> 02:55.605
No, Uncle Ray,
that's not my thing.

02:55.638 --> 02:58.939
Oh! I see.
Ha, let me guess.

02:58.972 --> 03:02.205
Have you invented another
wheel that rules the currents?

03:04.038 --> 03:07.840
Your discoveries are going to
turn our world upside down.

03:11.138 --> 03:14.538
"Your discoveries are gonna
turn our world upside down."

03:14.572 --> 03:17.606

03:59.305 --> 04:03.272
In the name of the shark that will bite
me, Delphi! Where were you?!

04:03.304 --> 04:06.339
You promised to go to the
Dolph-cathlon together!

04:06.371 --> 04:08.438
To the greatest,
most exciting event

04:08.471 --> 04:11.305
in the greatest town
in the Seven Seas!

04:12.971 --> 04:14.871
Oh, sorry, Zeb.

04:14.904 --> 04:16.338
I was exploring
the ancient ruins

04:16.372 --> 04:17.606
- on the lower floors.
- Mm-hmm.

04:17.637 --> 04:19.505
And I found
some unusual pictures,

04:19.539 --> 04:21.539
some kind
of instructions.

04:21.571 --> 04:24.438
It's some way of tossing
stones with your tail.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.971
A secret punch,
can you imagine?

04:28.504 --> 04:30.171
Oh, no!

04:30.204 --> 04:33.071
You will never quit
fantasizing, will you?

04:33.105 --> 04:35.072
Everyone already
laughs at you.

04:35.105 --> 04:37.239
Let 'em laugh.
It's a lot better

04:37.272 --> 04:38.605
than watching
some stupid match

04:38.638 --> 04:41.872
with a long time
predestined winner.

04:41.904 --> 04:43.305
- Alpha, Alpha.
- Alpha, look at me.

04:43.338 --> 04:44.572
One smile, please.

04:58.505 --> 04:59.905
Great! Let me guess.

04:59.938 --> 05:01.473
Alpha won again,
am I right?

05:02.571 --> 05:04.406
Okay, you're right.

05:04.439 --> 05:06.372
Yeah, this time
Alpha won again.

05:06.404 --> 05:09.605
But that's just because you
didn't want to take part.

05:09.639 --> 05:11.439
He definitely'd be
no match for you,

05:11.471 --> 05:13.572
once he saw
your secret punch.

05:25.005 --> 05:26.904
Catch me, stuff me,

05:26.938 --> 05:30.538
and dip me in hot fish oil!

05:30.572 --> 05:33.338
Looks like
one naive dolphin

05:33.372 --> 05:36.839
has been struck
by Cupid's love harpoon.

05:40.204 --> 05:41.438
Well, what?

05:41.472 --> 05:43.472
All I'm saying
is that Mia will be glad

05:43.504 --> 05:46.505
if you won't shy away and
finally take her someplace.

05:46.539 --> 05:49.506
To check out the brown algae
or black rocks, for instance.

05:50.638 --> 05:53.438
Me, Mia and brown algae
all around?

05:53.472 --> 05:57.405
That'll never happen,
not even in my wildest dreams.

05:57.439 --> 05:59.372
Mia's about to marry Alpha.

05:59.404 --> 06:01.138
That's what her father wants.

06:01.171 --> 06:04.171
Have you forgotten that Octavian
is the mayor of our town?

06:04.204 --> 06:06.405
She's not his blood,
she's his stepdaughter.

06:06.438 --> 06:09.238
He's an octopus,
and she's a dolphin, right?

06:09.271 --> 06:11.171
Trust me, Mia
will go out with me

06:11.204 --> 06:13.238
only on the day
the Gulf turns cold

06:13.272 --> 06:15.438
and all the salt
disappears from the ocean.

06:15.472 --> 06:17.472
Hi there, Delphi.

06:35.871 --> 06:38.172
What? Catfish
got your tongue?

06:38.204 --> 06:40.072
Oh, no, hi.

06:40.105 --> 06:41.104
Hi, Delphi.

06:41.138 --> 06:43.306
Ah, Delphi.

06:43.338 --> 06:46.538
I see you missed
the Dolph-cathlon again?

06:46.571 --> 06:51.572
I think he's just scared to face
a mighty mammal like you, Alpha.

06:51.606 --> 06:56.238
He's no warrior.
He's just a dreamer.

06:56.272 --> 06:57.573
"A dreamer"?

06:57.605 --> 07:01.039
Not a bit!
He's a supremer!

07:01.072 --> 07:03.905
Come on, Delphi, tell him
about your secret punch.

07:03.937 --> 07:05.438
Zeb, please,
don't start that.

07:05.472 --> 07:09.004
A secret punch?

07:09.038 --> 07:10.539
Try it on me, baby face.

07:10.571 --> 07:13.271
Come on, Alpha.
We'll be late for the council.

07:13.305 --> 07:17.239
Hang on. I really want
to see his secret punch.

07:18.339 --> 07:20.838
Come on, show me
this punch.

07:23.471 --> 07:26.439
Well, I'd love to show
you the secret punch,

07:26.472 --> 07:30.439
but then it wouldn't really be a
secret, would it?

07:30.471 --> 07:32.371
No. Uh...

07:32.404 --> 07:33.905
I mean, yes.

07:33.938 --> 07:36.406
I mean...
You're confusing me!

07:36.439 --> 07:38.105
This dreamer
is giving me a headache

07:38.138 --> 07:40.539
and a stomachache
and a tail ache.

07:40.572 --> 07:42.139
Let's swim.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.138
We really need
to get to the council.

07:45.938 --> 07:47.871
Mia,
don't fall behind!

07:52.372 --> 07:54.406
<i>My dear citizens,</i>

07:54.438 --> 07:58.471
I have been a mayor of this
town for a few years now.

07:58.505 --> 08:03.172
You and I, tentacle to
tentacle, fin to fin,

08:03.205 --> 08:06.606
have been through a lot
and have swum through a lot.

08:06.638 --> 08:10.905
But now we see the
currents are changing.

08:10.937 --> 08:13.306
Fish Town
needs a new hero,

08:13.339 --> 08:17.172
someone who can navigate
through the storm

08:17.205 --> 08:20.105
and lead us
to calmer waters.

08:20.137 --> 08:23.372
Fish Town needs
a new leader.

08:23.404 --> 08:27.939
And this leader
is... me.

08:27.972 --> 08:30.272
Do you have
any more questions?

08:30.304 --> 08:34.238
Huh? What? Where am I?

08:34.270 --> 08:36.938
Oh, my dear
lady Demetra,

08:36.972 --> 08:40.139
you are here now,
at the council.

08:40.172 --> 08:42.837
Well, I have a question.

08:42.871 --> 08:44.573
Very well.

08:44.605 --> 08:48.439
I'm happy to give the floor
to anglerfish Udo,

08:48.472 --> 08:51.872
'cause they complain that we
always dismiss the opposition

08:51.905 --> 08:53.439
and never
let them speak.

08:53.472 --> 08:55.972
Hah. We're listening.

08:56.004 --> 08:59.938
My dear mayor,
we all actually remember

08:59.971 --> 09:02.505
what you promised us
before the elections.

09:02.539 --> 09:06.573
Well, but nothing ever
came out of that.

09:06.604 --> 09:09.604
For example,
what about street lights?

09:09.638 --> 09:14.372
You promised all of us fish that
nights would be as bright as day,

09:14.404 --> 09:18.539
but many streets in our
town are still very dark,

09:18.571 --> 09:22.173
and your beloved citizens
still get bumps and bruises.

09:27.472 --> 09:29.239
Yes, indeed.

09:29.272 --> 09:32.239
Some of the lights are still
missing, that's true.

09:32.271 --> 09:34.172
But we conducted
an investigation

09:34.205 --> 09:38.839
that showed your own
employees from AnglerLights,

09:38.872 --> 09:42.105
who, as we know,
report to you, my dear sir,

09:42.138 --> 09:44.906
have themselves
taken out those bulbs.

09:46.605 --> 09:48.604
Mm...

09:48.637 --> 09:54.339
I'll make sure that the guilty
ones will bear the consequences.

09:54.372 --> 09:57.471
But there is also
disorder in the town.

09:57.504 --> 10:01.605
Three days ago,
soccer fans trashed half a block

10:01.638 --> 10:05.405
after the final match
of Tuna vs. Codfish.

10:09.938 --> 10:15.371
Hmm, well, I admit,
that did happen, yes.

10:15.405 --> 10:20.172
But we found out that the
reason for that...

10:20.204 --> 10:22.938
was an unlicensed
betting house,

10:22.972 --> 10:26.939
as the fans had not
received their winnings.

10:26.971 --> 10:29.571
And we tend to believe

10:29.605 --> 10:33.472
that the game was
organized by some...

10:33.504 --> 10:37.072
unknown anglerfish.

10:37.104 --> 10:41.038
A coincidence?
I don't think so.

10:44.438 --> 10:47.972
Well, me...
I-I've heard...

10:48.005 --> 10:50.038
I know for a fact

10:50.072 --> 10:54.206
that the wedding of our famous
elite dolphin guard Alpha

10:54.239 --> 10:58.905
and your stepdaughter has been
financed from the town budget.

10:58.938 --> 11:01.038
Am I right, Mr. Mayor?

11:01.071 --> 11:04.005
You want to have fun
at our expense?

11:04.038 --> 11:06.339
No, it's you, Udo!

11:06.372 --> 11:10.471
You're desperately trying to fish
out some lucre from the town budget.

11:10.503 --> 11:14.504
But I'll make sure
your angle never gets there.

11:14.537 --> 11:16.439
I'll never let you do that.

11:16.471 --> 11:20.538
Hah!
Once I become mayor...

11:20.570 --> 11:24.338
I will... I will...
I will...

11:24.371 --> 11:28.071
I will show all of you!
Foolish fish!

11:28.105 --> 11:32.239
Thank goodness.
Let our assembly proceed.

11:32.271 --> 11:34.405
So, what's up next,
Celine?

11:41.104 --> 11:44.271
Every day,
Alpha and Octavian

11:44.305 --> 11:49.239
discuss dolphin guards posts and
passwords for entering the city.

11:49.272 --> 11:52.571
Do they really think
I don't know them?

11:52.605 --> 11:54.004
Hah!

11:54.037 --> 11:56.871
They're
laughing at me.

11:56.904 --> 11:59.838
Well, soon the tides

11:59.872 --> 12:04.039
will for sure turn
against you, Octavian.

12:24.104 --> 12:27.172
We are morays!

12:27.205 --> 12:34.072
So stop living in the dark and barren
murky trenches, like some petty nomads,

12:34.104 --> 12:39.138
while all those other
worthless finned nullities

12:39.171 --> 12:42.370
live in the prosperous
Fish Town.

12:42.404 --> 12:45.505
Boss! But what are we
planning to do

12:45.537 --> 12:47.972
about their elite
dolphin guards?

12:48.005 --> 12:51.239
For them,
I have a master plan.

12:51.272 --> 12:56.872
I need you three to swim out to
the Black Rock by the old fortress.

12:56.905 --> 13:00.572
There you will wait
for a secret contact of mine.

13:00.604 --> 13:02.972
- A double agent?
- Yes.

13:03.005 --> 13:04.571
- I wonder who he works for.
- Exactly.

13:04.605 --> 13:06.939
- Is it clear?
- Yeah.

13:06.972 --> 13:08.370
Off you go, then!

13:08.404 --> 13:11.171
Fish Town will be ours!

13:11.205 --> 13:12.938
Once and forever.

13:14.370 --> 13:16.205
Why do you have
to train your secret punch

13:16.238 --> 13:19.206
by the old fortress?
We can't get in there.

13:19.239 --> 13:21.438
Its walls rise
over the water.

13:21.471 --> 13:23.872
Besides, Octavian
forbade us to go there

13:23.904 --> 13:25.537
after your Dad's
disappearance.

13:25.570 --> 13:28.571
You know, it's been a year
since he disappeared.

13:28.605 --> 13:31.104
Yes, a whole year.

13:31.137 --> 13:32.904
But I believe
he's alive,

13:32.937 --> 13:35.171
even though everybody
keeps saying he's dead.

13:35.205 --> 13:38.571
Well, maybe you don't need
any secret punch.

13:38.605 --> 13:42.005
Maybe you just want
to find your father.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.405
Me? No.

13:43.437 --> 13:45.304
I mean...
I just...

13:45.338 --> 13:48.172
His disappearance
was really strange.

13:48.205 --> 13:51.305
I think he sensed
something.

13:53.403 --> 13:55.405
Delphi, my son.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.470
In life, you can achieve
anything you want.

14:00.504 --> 14:02.537
Just remain
brave and honest.

14:02.571 --> 14:05.838
And never give up
following your dream.

14:05.871 --> 14:08.904
Dad, why are you
telling me all this?

14:08.938 --> 14:11.005
Has something happened?

14:11.038 --> 14:13.305
No. But it could.

14:13.338 --> 14:16.504
Soon I must embark
on a dangerous trip, son,

14:16.538 --> 14:18.537
and I'm afraid
I may never come back.

14:18.570 --> 14:21.905
"May never come back"?
What do you mean?

14:23.071 --> 14:25.238
Are you going somewhere
far away?

14:25.270 --> 14:28.939
Yes, Delphi.
Very, very far away.

14:28.972 --> 14:31.239
But I hope that
everything will be fine,

14:31.271 --> 14:34.072
and I will come home.

14:34.104 --> 14:35.504
It's gonna be fine.

14:38.338 --> 14:39.539
Father!

14:42.271 --> 14:45.239
Yeah. Your dad
is a great dolphin,

14:45.270 --> 14:48.205
a brilliant scientist.
He'll find a way back.

14:48.237 --> 14:51.938
But if not, guess what?
I can replace him. Check it out:

14:51.972 --> 14:53.572
"Tell me, my son,

14:53.605 --> 14:56.538
why are you embarrassing me
in front of fish and mammals?

14:56.570 --> 14:59.304
Why are you such a wimp
when it comes to that Mia?

14:59.337 --> 15:01.205
If I were younger,
I would..."

15:01.238 --> 15:03.838
What?

15:03.871 --> 15:06.604
Bite my fins off!

15:06.637 --> 15:08.904
Look at this place!

15:28.370 --> 15:31.304
Okay, it's time to start
mastering my punch.

15:31.338 --> 15:32.871
What do we have here?

15:32.904 --> 15:35.238
For example,
I'll start with, uh...

15:35.271 --> 15:37.971
I should start with...
With that wall!

15:40.204 --> 15:42.572
- This one?
- Well, yeah.

15:42.605 --> 15:43.939
Really, why not?

15:46.637 --> 15:48.938
One, two, three!

15:52.871 --> 15:56.404
Um... if you wanna break
that wall with the rock,

15:56.438 --> 16:01.337
use the Force inside you
to throw you must, my young Padawan.

16:01.370 --> 16:02.971
I saw that on <i>Sea Wars.</i>

16:03.004 --> 16:04.939
All this is such nonsense.

16:04.972 --> 16:08.872
Oh, come on, Delphi.
You are the only true superhero.

16:08.905 --> 16:11.371
Yeah?
Okay then.

16:21.871 --> 16:22.905
Well...

16:24.371 --> 16:26.404
Let's do it again.
I believe in you.

16:26.437 --> 16:28.504
- You do?
- Absolutely, bro.

16:28.537 --> 16:30.971
And you have to believe
in yourself, too.

16:31.005 --> 16:33.071
"Believe in myself"?

16:33.104 --> 16:35.437
Yeah, I believe in me.

16:35.471 --> 16:36.471
Hold my water...

17:05.369 --> 17:08.503
I think it kinda
looks like me.

17:08.538 --> 17:10.171
Don't you think so?

17:10.203 --> 17:14.369
Why it resembles you?
It looks more like me.

17:17.471 --> 17:21.338
Nah, nothing in common.
He looks just like me.

17:21.371 --> 17:23.405
Like me!

17:23.436 --> 17:25.070
- Like me!
- Like me!

17:25.104 --> 17:26.171
Like me!

17:26.203 --> 17:28.404
- Me! Me!
- Me! Me!

17:28.438 --> 17:31.171
- Me! Me! Me!
- Me! Me! Me!

17:37.605 --> 17:39.305
- Me! Me!
- Me! Me!

17:39.337 --> 17:41.304
- Me! Me! Me!
- Me! Me! Me!

17:41.338 --> 17:42.572
- Me!
- Me!

17:42.604 --> 17:44.437
Shut up, you two!

17:44.471 --> 17:45.905
Hm?

17:45.937 --> 17:48.971
I'm behind you, you morons.

17:49.005 --> 17:51.006
Did you hear that sound?

17:52.137 --> 17:54.972
What? What happened?

17:55.004 --> 17:57.204
Let's swim,
let's check it out.

18:08.005 --> 18:10.006
Where're those morays?

18:12.404 --> 18:14.939
Eels can be so slippery.

18:14.972 --> 18:18.604
You just can't
do business with them.

18:18.638 --> 18:23.271
Well... I'll have
to use plan B.

18:32.137 --> 18:33.872
That's unbelievable!

18:33.905 --> 18:36.337
Holy sashimi!

18:36.371 --> 18:38.472
I have always
believed in you, bro!

18:42.503 --> 18:46.337
I can't believe it, Zeb!
I made a discovery!

18:46.371 --> 18:48.138
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

18:49.303 --> 18:53.038
I'm cool! I'm smart!
I'm wise!

18:53.070 --> 18:56.037
I'm just like
the old turtle Demetra!

19:00.071 --> 19:04.171
Aunt Demetra!
What did you do?!

19:04.203 --> 19:06.537
You accidentally swallowed
up my best friend!

19:06.571 --> 19:09.205
Delphi, hold on!
I'll save ya!

19:09.237 --> 19:11.504
Ah, just don't
eat anything in there!

19:11.538 --> 19:13.605
She's full of everything
that's expired!

19:13.637 --> 19:15.838
It's me, Delphi.

19:15.872 --> 19:18.938
Cross my stripes, Delphi!

19:18.971 --> 19:21.539
You now look like
Auntie Demetra!

19:23.570 --> 19:25.604
But that's impossible.

19:25.638 --> 19:28.004
Am I really a turtle now?

19:28.036 --> 19:31.204
Whoa! No way.

19:32.637 --> 19:35.470
I look just like
Auntie Demetra.

19:35.504 --> 19:37.171
All I did was say her name

19:37.204 --> 19:39.471
just before I went through
the ancient arch.

19:39.503 --> 19:41.938
And now look at me, Zeb.

19:44.203 --> 19:46.003
It's pure magic.

19:46.036 --> 19:49.271
First you name someone,
then you become them.

19:49.303 --> 19:50.405
Voila!

19:50.437 --> 19:51.539
Let's give it a try.

19:52.605 --> 19:56.438
I want to be a-a shark.

19:56.470 --> 19:57.604
Whoo-hoo!

19:57.638 --> 19:59.971
I'm a striped shark now!

20:00.003 --> 20:01.270
Are my teeth sharp enough?

20:02.238 --> 20:04.438
What is this arch?

20:04.470 --> 20:06.937
I have no idea!

20:06.971 --> 20:08.905
But it's definitely magic.

20:08.936 --> 20:10.838
Let me try.

20:10.872 --> 20:13.438
I want to have loads of money!

20:18.605 --> 20:21.538
Hey, what's this?!
I didn't mean it like that!

20:21.570 --> 20:23.305
Delphi, help!

20:23.337 --> 20:25.470
I don't wanna be
a piece of metal.

20:25.504 --> 20:28.104
I'll pay ya. Any money!

20:28.137 --> 20:29.806
I have a lot now.

20:30.970 --> 20:32.404
Let's try one more time.

20:32.438 --> 20:34.538
Maybe we'll manage
to become ourselves again.

20:34.571 --> 20:36.971
Mm-hmm!

20:37.003 --> 20:39.971
We wanna become
Delphi and Zeb again.

20:42.036 --> 20:44.505
It worked!

20:44.537 --> 20:47.004
Yeah, I can see
my fins now.

20:49.437 --> 20:51.103
Delphi, you know?

20:51.136 --> 20:53.237
I can still feel
some coins in my belly.

21:00.171 --> 21:04.538
Bite me, my dumb brothers,
I must be dreaming.

21:06.103 --> 21:08.437
Hey, what are you?
What are you, crazy?

21:08.471 --> 21:10.904
It was just a figure of
speech, morons.

21:17.037 --> 21:19.271
We made
the greatest discovery!

21:19.304 --> 21:21.904
We should tell Octavian
as soon as possible!

21:21.937 --> 21:23.839
No, Delphi,
it's a big mistake.

21:23.870 --> 21:27.337
The magic arch is our secret.
You didn't forget, did you?

21:27.370 --> 21:31.504
The magic arch could make Fish
Town safe forever and ever.

21:31.537 --> 21:35.470
The main thing is we don't
let it get into any nasty fins.

21:36.501 --> 21:38.137
"Some nasty fins"?
It won't!

21:38.171 --> 21:39.871
You and me have
the best fins ever.

21:39.903 --> 21:41.104
Halt you two!

21:43.170 --> 21:47.003
- What's the password?
- Come on, Alpha, let us through.

21:47.037 --> 21:49.537
No, Delphi.
Not without the password.

21:49.571 --> 21:51.205
Come on, stop it.

21:51.237 --> 21:53.537
I have something important
to tell Octavian.

21:53.571 --> 21:55.837
- What is it?
- It's a secret.

21:55.870 --> 21:59.070
Again your secrets.
I'm sorry, Delphi.

21:59.104 --> 22:02.537
You don't know the password,
so you can't swim inside.

22:02.571 --> 22:05.137
Don't you know that place
is out of bounds?

22:05.171 --> 22:06.871
What did you do there?

22:06.903 --> 22:09.505
I bet he saw those two-legged
creatures with strange tubes.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.037
Again, for the tenth time.

22:12.071 --> 22:14.305
Delphi, they say you're still
planning to become one of our guards.

22:14.338 --> 22:16.505
Well,
don't even bother.

22:17.605 --> 22:19.838
A wimp can never become
one of us.

22:19.871 --> 22:22.103
But I can promise you,
whenever we decide

22:22.137 --> 22:24.538
to put together
a seahorse SWAT team,

22:24.570 --> 22:27.305
you'll be on the list.
Number one.

22:27.337 --> 22:28.537
Me, wimp?

22:28.571 --> 22:31.437
- Yeah.
- You all... I will...

22:31.470 --> 22:34.070
I will show you
how strong I am!

22:38.638 --> 22:40.104
Oh, no, no, Delphi.

22:40.137 --> 22:43.003
No, no, don't do that,
please!

22:43.037 --> 22:48.572
You, minnow, don't ever
show your snout here again!

22:48.604 --> 22:49.970
- Alpha?
- Hm?

22:50.004 --> 22:52.070
What's going on here?

22:52.104 --> 22:55.871
Delphi was trying to swim out of
a no-go zone without a password.

22:55.903 --> 22:58.470
Yeah. And Alpha
didn't let him through.

22:58.504 --> 23:00.370
- Alpha?
- What?

23:00.404 --> 23:04.371
Honey, I'm just doing my duty.
By the way,

23:04.404 --> 23:06.871
why do you care about
this useless piece of crap?

23:06.903 --> 23:08.137
Piece of crap.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.870
I think it's none
of your business.

23:09.904 --> 23:11.038
Just you wait.

23:11.070 --> 23:13.104
You're gonna sing
a different tune

23:13.136 --> 23:15.238
the day that you
become my wife.

23:15.270 --> 23:17.037
Well, I'm not
your wife yet,

23:17.071 --> 23:19.205
and I can say
whatever I want to.

23:28.004 --> 23:29.971
I just don't get it.

23:30.003 --> 23:32.305
What do you
like about this Delphi?

23:32.337 --> 23:35.903
He's a dreamer,
who has too much whitecaps on his mind.

23:35.937 --> 23:40.271
True, but still...
But he-he's really romantic.

23:40.303 --> 23:43.204
Although
he's also very shy.

23:43.238 --> 23:46.071
You're
dating Alpha.

23:46.103 --> 23:48.205
He's a hundred times cooler.

23:48.237 --> 23:50.070
Alpha? Hah!

23:50.104 --> 23:52.305
Alpha's too selfish
and swell-headed.

23:52.337 --> 23:54.270
And he thinks
that I'm his property,

23:54.304 --> 23:56.205
even though we
are not married yet.

23:56.237 --> 23:57.537
That's not true.

23:57.571 --> 24:00.271
Alpha... He's not
like that at all!

24:00.303 --> 24:03.937
Dora, dear, why are you
defending him like that?

24:03.970 --> 24:06.270
Maybe you're the one
who is into him?

24:06.303 --> 24:07.470
What? Me?

24:07.504 --> 24:11.438
No. I just... Uh...

24:11.471 --> 24:14.037
You're my friend.
I want you to be happy.

24:14.071 --> 24:16.438
Yeah, right.
I see that, of course.

24:16.470 --> 24:19.470
Everybody all the time
wants me to be happy.

24:19.503 --> 24:23.171
Dad, Alpha, now you too.

24:23.203 --> 24:25.137
Okay, let's just swim.

24:25.170 --> 24:26.870
And enough about Delphi.

24:34.004 --> 24:35.904
Calling me a wimp!

24:35.937 --> 24:39.338
Just you wait.
I'll show Alpha who's who.

24:39.370 --> 24:43.372
I'll turn into a giant shark,
and then I'll kick his tail!

25:00.538 --> 25:04.405
Why don't we, you know,
also turn into someone?

25:04.438 --> 25:06.471
Yeah!

25:06.503 --> 25:09.404
Into whom? Morays are
the most beautiful

25:09.437 --> 25:12.404
and strong creatures
in the global ocean.

25:12.438 --> 25:16.038
But not the largest ones.

25:16.070 --> 25:19.871
I am a big,
a really big moray.

25:24.237 --> 25:25.404
Hmm...

25:25.437 --> 25:29.871
Whoa, Nik.
You're as big as a shark.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.337
Yeah.

25:31.371 --> 25:35.205
Come on, brothers.
Transform yourselves now.

25:37.636 --> 25:42.037
Whoa! I have become
a real giant.

25:42.071 --> 25:43.538
Me too.

25:43.571 --> 25:46.571
Quiet! Listen
to my new plan.

25:46.604 --> 25:50.205
You two stay here
and guard the magic arch,

25:50.238 --> 25:54.504
and I'll swim to Morenius
and tell him the news.

25:54.538 --> 25:56.538
He'll take
all the morays here.

25:56.569 --> 25:58.570
We'll all transform,

25:58.604 --> 26:02.005
and then we'll easily
conquer Fish Town.

26:05.636 --> 26:09.603
Delphi! Delphi!

26:09.637 --> 26:13.003
Delphi, where are you?

26:13.036 --> 26:15.103
Delphi!

26:15.136 --> 26:17.238
Delphi?

26:20.970 --> 26:24.070
- Delphi, where're you going?
- To Octavian!

26:24.104 --> 26:27.205
Has he decided
to tell him our secret?

26:27.238 --> 26:29.372
Delphi, wait!

26:31.271 --> 26:34.971
Alpha is one big fool for
letting Mia talk like that.

26:35.003 --> 26:37.270
- If I had a girlfriend, I...
- Stop your bubbling!

26:37.304 --> 26:39.271
Find yourself
a girlfriend, Beta,

26:39.304 --> 26:41.370
and then you will judge me.

26:43.503 --> 26:46.337
Hey, I said no entry
without a password.

26:46.371 --> 26:50.205
We don't have much time!
We have to warn Octavian now!

26:53.238 --> 26:55.838
Hey, that was
the wrong password!

27:04.270 --> 27:05.970
<i>Father?</i>

27:06.004 --> 27:09.104
I think I need
to talk to you.

27:09.137 --> 27:11.604
It's about Alpha
and our wedding.

27:11.637 --> 27:13.604
- I...
- What about the wedding?

27:13.636 --> 27:17.305
Well,
don't you worry, Mia.

27:17.337 --> 27:19.304
You'll marry soon.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.471
First, we'll have
elections, then...

27:21.502 --> 27:23.870
No, in fact
I wanted to say...

27:25.070 --> 27:27.304
You can't just barge
in here unannounced!

27:27.337 --> 27:28.603
What in the Neptune's name?

27:28.637 --> 27:30.971
I'm sorry, Octavian.

27:31.003 --> 27:34.305
I have very...
important news for you.

27:34.337 --> 27:35.837
A-ha! Gotcha!

27:35.871 --> 27:38.103
Get lost,
you dumb piece of muscle!

27:38.137 --> 27:40.338
Not now, Alpha.
Fish Town is in danger.

27:40.370 --> 27:43.837
The only one in danger is you.
You didn't say the password!

27:43.871 --> 27:45.504
There's no time
for this nonsense now.

27:45.536 --> 27:49.338
What? What you mean,
"No time for this nonsense now"?

27:49.370 --> 27:52.171
Protocols and passwords
are not "this nonsense."

27:52.203 --> 27:55.438
Such words are a slippery
slope to town problems!

27:55.469 --> 27:56.938
Just listen to us.

27:56.970 --> 27:59.237
Zeb and I were exploring

27:59.271 --> 28:00.938
the old fortress this morning...

28:00.971 --> 28:03.438
Oh, I don't want to listen
to this rubbish.

28:03.469 --> 28:06.205
Without regulations
and protocols,

28:06.237 --> 28:08.469
society would rot
and collapse.

28:08.503 --> 28:10.537
Okay, point taken.
But the thing is,

28:10.569 --> 28:12.903
we were there and I was
training and suddenly...

28:12.937 --> 28:16.571
Oh, please, don't say you were
training your secret punch.

28:16.603 --> 28:18.536
Yes. The secret punch.

28:18.570 --> 28:21.204
I was practicing it
and-and I tore

28:21.238 --> 28:23.469
a little hole
in the fortress wall.

28:23.503 --> 28:26.305
Yeah! And there, inside,
we found a hidden city!

28:26.338 --> 28:29.871
Amazing pyramids and buildings and...
a magic arch, too!

28:29.904 --> 28:32.305
Okay, you're crazy
too, Zeb.

28:32.337 --> 28:34.270
Delphi's imagination
is contagious.

28:34.304 --> 28:37.205
Can't you understand?
The magic arch is real!

28:37.237 --> 28:39.070
And it can turn you
into anything, so...

28:39.104 --> 28:43.371
I understand, but regulations
and laws are there for a reason.

28:43.402 --> 28:45.104
They must be followed.

28:46.536 --> 28:49.503
Father, I think
you're missing the point.

28:49.537 --> 28:51.469
Excuse me, then.

28:51.502 --> 28:54.170
I think that this is
the very point, Mia.

28:54.204 --> 28:57.338
Fish Town
requires law and order.

28:57.370 --> 28:59.971
You can't have one
without the other.

29:00.003 --> 29:03.237
Without regulations,
we're no better than jellyfish.

29:03.270 --> 29:04.970
Octavian, I beg you!

29:05.004 --> 29:07.338
I saw several
moray eels there.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.603
They swam through the arch

29:08.636 --> 29:11.070
and transformed
into the size of whales.

29:11.104 --> 29:13.504
And now they're going to lead
Morenius to the arch

29:13.536 --> 29:17.237
and the other morays, for them to
transform and invade Fish Town!

29:17.271 --> 29:21.903
A magic transformative arch?
Delphi, who will believe you?

29:21.937 --> 29:23.838
Everyone knows
the sunken fortress

29:23.870 --> 29:26.537
was built by the ancients,
just like the very Fish Town.

29:26.569 --> 29:28.570
You can't simply
break its outer wall,

29:28.604 --> 29:30.838
even with some secret punch.

29:30.871 --> 29:32.470
But I did break it!

29:32.503 --> 29:35.604
The secret punch?
I want to see this punch.

29:35.637 --> 29:38.970
What? N-no.
It's not important.

29:39.003 --> 29:41.469
Oh, I think
it is, though.

29:41.503 --> 29:44.104
If with my very exceptional
critical eyes

29:44.137 --> 29:45.971
I see this power
you speak of,

29:46.003 --> 29:49.970
then perhaps I'll believe the
rest of your fairytale, then.

29:50.004 --> 29:51.170
So, go on.

29:51.203 --> 29:53.937
Show me this secret punch,
if you dare.

29:53.971 --> 29:55.571
Oh.

29:55.604 --> 29:58.437
Well, it takes
some concentration.

29:58.470 --> 30:02.004
Oh, of course.
Concentrate then, Delphi.

30:02.036 --> 30:03.904
There's no hurry.

30:06.037 --> 30:07.272
Okay.

30:13.436 --> 30:15.137
Hm? Hm?

30:17.037 --> 30:18.938
Oh, a dreamer.

30:18.970 --> 30:21.270
His father
was exactly the same.

30:21.302 --> 30:23.904
He didn't follow
protocols either.

30:23.936 --> 30:26.870
And where is he now?
Nobody knows.

30:26.903 --> 30:30.437
Because your father
simply vanished.

30:30.469 --> 30:34.503
In the future,
do try to follow the regulations, kiddo.

30:45.070 --> 30:49.003
Ah, that's news to me.

30:49.036 --> 30:52.838
So, the morays think they can
play it their way without me.

30:52.870 --> 30:56.970
Fine, then. I'll make
sure they regret it.

30:58.469 --> 31:02.070
Father, what if Delphi
was telling the truth?

31:02.103 --> 31:06.469
What if he did actually uncover
the secret transformative arch,

31:06.502 --> 31:10.003
and now Morenius might use
it to attack Fish Town?

31:10.036 --> 31:14.503
Oh, don't make
my tentacles laugh.

31:14.537 --> 31:18.037
Such event is the highest
of highly unlikely things.

31:18.071 --> 31:21.172
Perhaps you're right.
But what if not?

31:22.204 --> 31:25.004
Oh, very well. Okay.

31:25.037 --> 31:27.236
Alpha,
take Beta and Gamma,

31:27.269 --> 31:30.403
swim there and check
the sunken fortress.

31:30.436 --> 31:33.003
We can't have "Fake News"
casting a pall

31:33.037 --> 31:35.304
over our elections
that can kick up silt.

31:35.336 --> 31:38.504
- But look...
- It's an order, Alpha.

31:38.536 --> 31:42.070
- Yes, aye-aye, Octavian.
- Thank you so much, father.

31:42.104 --> 31:44.537
There's no need
to thank me, my dear.

31:44.569 --> 31:49.303
You know I care about Fish Town
with all three hearts.

31:57.137 --> 32:00.904
Delphi always comes up
with crazy ideas.

32:00.936 --> 32:02.369
Yeah, he's hopeless.

32:02.403 --> 32:05.838
And to think his father
was such a respected man.

32:05.871 --> 32:07.370
Great man.

32:07.402 --> 32:11.469
But how? How could I have
failed so terribly there?

32:11.502 --> 32:13.403
And every shrimp saw it.

32:13.437 --> 32:16.470
I can't believe I couldn't
repeat my secret punch.

32:16.503 --> 32:20.137
How humiliating!
Such a disgrace!

32:20.171 --> 32:22.370
Listen, don't be
hard on yourself.

32:22.403 --> 32:24.603
Your conscience is clear.
You warned them,

32:24.637 --> 32:26.838
and after all, you should learn
how to lose.

32:26.870 --> 32:29.870
Before you learn to lose,
you need to learn how to win.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.537
And I can't win!

32:31.569 --> 32:34.903
You just needed
to believe in yourself.

32:34.937 --> 32:38.270
No, my friend.
I need others to believe in me too.

32:38.302 --> 32:40.203
But wait,
I believe in you.

32:40.237 --> 32:41.370
Me too.

32:41.403 --> 32:44.537
- I also believe in you.
- Really?

32:45.903 --> 32:47.903
Well, I mean,

32:47.936 --> 32:49.971
I think your words
should be considered,

32:50.003 --> 32:51.369
and we need
to check everything.

32:51.402 --> 32:54.536
There. I don't believe
that you believe in me!

32:54.570 --> 32:56.369
You just feel
sorry for me.

32:56.403 --> 32:58.370
And I don't need
your pity, Mia!

32:58.403 --> 33:01.537
- I'll do it myself.
- Delphi!

33:03.036 --> 33:05.571
Oh, my goldfish!
What do I do with him now?

33:05.603 --> 33:08.970
Nothing, Zeb.
Dora and I will swim to the fortress.

33:09.003 --> 33:11.170
And if everything
is like Delphi told us,

33:11.202 --> 33:14.236
then I will back up his words.
Octavian will believe me.

33:15.637 --> 33:17.104
No! You're crazy!

33:17.136 --> 33:19.070
What if the morays
are still around?

33:19.104 --> 33:20.437
Then it's too dangerous.

33:20.470 --> 33:23.938
Dangerous?
Doesn't matter.

33:23.970 --> 33:25.570
Dora and I will do it.

33:25.603 --> 33:27.870
Otherwise the town
can be ruined.

33:29.336 --> 33:32.103
Mia, wait, don't go!

33:32.136 --> 33:34.038
You don't understand!

33:41.370 --> 33:43.870
Faster, faster now!

33:43.904 --> 33:46.004
Get the lead out of your tail!

33:46.037 --> 33:48.304
Come on! Come on!

33:48.336 --> 33:50.336
Another ten times around!

33:50.370 --> 33:52.571
That's it! Come on!

33:52.603 --> 33:54.037
Move it!

33:58.269 --> 34:01.270
Faster! Faster now!

34:01.303 --> 34:04.071
Alpha, I thought
my father ordered you

34:04.102 --> 34:07.103
to go to the fortress
and to check Delphi's words.

34:07.135 --> 34:10.404
He did, you see, and now we're
busy training for our mission.

34:13.202 --> 34:15.603
Who said you could
stop swimming now?!

34:15.636 --> 34:16.904
Keep moving!

34:19.203 --> 34:20.204
Move your tailfins!

34:22.370 --> 34:23.871
You're training?

34:23.904 --> 34:26.136
Delphi said that Morenius
and the morays

34:26.168 --> 34:27.969
are planning
to attack our town.

34:28.003 --> 34:29.837
Delphi says a lot of things.

34:29.871 --> 34:31.838
That luna-fin can tell
a fairytale

34:31.870 --> 34:34.170
as easy as he can
wave his tail.

34:34.203 --> 34:38.170
Alpha, if Delphi is right,
then Fish Town is in danger.

34:38.202 --> 34:42.137
Your father ordered me
to go check the fortress.

34:42.168 --> 34:46.235
But he didn't say
<i>when</i> I had to swim there.

34:46.270 --> 34:48.603
So, show some respect
to your boy-fin

34:48.636 --> 34:52.337
and stop bothering him while
he trains his elite guards!

34:52.369 --> 34:53.469
Hmm.

34:55.034 --> 34:57.937
Fine, then.
We'll check it ourselves.

34:57.971 --> 34:59.337
Let's swim, Dora.

34:59.370 --> 35:01.469
Sorry, Mia, but...

35:01.502 --> 35:04.336
but I trust
Alpha's opinion on this.

35:04.370 --> 35:08.371
He's in charge here.
And he's my commander.

35:10.603 --> 35:12.837
Yeah, I understand.

35:14.036 --> 35:15.437
I'll manage without you.

35:25.436 --> 35:27.570
Okay. Fine.

35:27.604 --> 35:28.971
They didn't believe me,

35:29.003 --> 35:31.504
but anyway,
I need to do something.

35:31.537 --> 35:32.905
But how?

35:34.237 --> 35:37.536
I can't take on the morays
all by myself.

35:37.569 --> 35:41.369
But, on the other fin,
if I don't do that now,

35:41.402 --> 35:45.136
Fish Town may fall
into their sharp-toothed mouths!

35:45.170 --> 35:46.871
Hey, buddy!
I was looking for you.

35:46.904 --> 35:50.304
Listen, Mia decided
to swim into the fortress

35:50.337 --> 35:52.369
to see the morays herself.

35:52.402 --> 35:55.903
Huh? Mia is in danger
because of me now?

35:55.937 --> 35:57.237
I'll be right back!

35:59.603 --> 36:03.536
Again?! Bless my tuna!
My mom was right.

36:03.570 --> 36:06.370
I should have made friends
with turtles.

36:06.402 --> 36:09.070
Delphi! Wait!

36:16.035 --> 36:19.404
Oh, some crabs
are gnawing at my hearts.

36:19.436 --> 36:22.269
What if Delphi
was telling the truth?

36:22.303 --> 36:24.603
What will happen
to the town? To Mia?

36:24.636 --> 36:26.837
Do you remember
how we found her?

36:26.871 --> 36:28.437
Of course I do.

36:38.070 --> 36:42.002
Oh, Celine,
look at this little thing.

36:42.035 --> 36:44.002
- Hm.
- Hmm...

36:44.036 --> 36:47.404
I think her parents must have
died in a fight or something.

36:52.036 --> 36:54.003
Dad-dy?

36:55.502 --> 36:57.136
Oh.

36:57.170 --> 37:01.537
She... she called me
"Daddy."

37:01.570 --> 37:04.003
Aww, it was meant to be.

37:04.036 --> 37:06.970
You should adopt
this poor child.

37:08.270 --> 37:10.003
Yeah.

37:10.036 --> 37:13.203
And now
she's all grown up.

37:13.236 --> 37:15.804
She's become so stubborn.

37:20.970 --> 37:25.037
What? The morays?
I don't see any morays here.

37:25.070 --> 37:27.169
There're no morays,
I'm sure.

37:27.202 --> 37:28.536
Me, afraid?

37:30.935 --> 37:32.937
I'm not afraid of anything.

37:33.936 --> 37:37.270
What a place.

37:42.437 --> 37:45.271
Okay, Mia,
you made it here.

37:57.469 --> 38:00.036
How beautiful.

38:00.069 --> 38:03.003
It turns out Delphi
was telling the truth.

38:06.270 --> 38:07.903
Oh, it's you.

38:07.936 --> 38:09.571
Well, who else
could it be?

38:09.604 --> 38:12.137
Did you really think
I'd let you swim here alone?

38:12.169 --> 38:15.170
- You're my best friend.
- I hope so.

38:15.203 --> 38:18.936
All right, let's swim and see
what there is to find here.

38:25.069 --> 38:26.404
Look!

38:26.436 --> 38:29.370
This must be that magic arch
of transformations

38:29.402 --> 38:31.236
Delphi was
telling us about.

38:31.270 --> 38:32.970
Arch of transformations?

38:33.002 --> 38:36.503
It can turn you into anything
you ever wanted to be.

38:36.537 --> 38:40.337
So, it could make me
just as beautiful as you are?

38:40.370 --> 38:43.537
Or it can make me
as strong as <i>you</i> are!

38:43.570 --> 38:45.836
At least that's what
Delphi told us.

38:45.869 --> 38:47.203
Hard to believe.

38:47.236 --> 38:51.102
But in any case,
we should check it out.

38:51.136 --> 38:52.869
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

38:52.902 --> 38:56.537
I smell dolphin sashimi.
Yum, yum, yum.

38:56.569 --> 38:58.002
Yeah!

39:01.936 --> 39:05.204
I can't believe it.
Zeb, what were you thinking?

39:05.236 --> 39:07.503
How could you let her go
into the fortress alone?

39:07.536 --> 39:09.270
The morays are there!

39:09.303 --> 39:11.571
Is this what
true friends do now?

39:11.603 --> 39:15.170
I tried to stop her,
but she didn't bother to listen to me.

39:15.202 --> 39:16.370
Just like you.

39:25.236 --> 39:26.937
Swim faster, Mia!

39:26.969 --> 39:31.337
I'll hold them back!

39:31.369 --> 39:34.236
Well, boys, you wanna fight?

39:37.503 --> 39:39.003
Dora! Mia!

39:39.035 --> 39:40.337
Hold on, girls!

39:45.569 --> 39:47.869
You filthy,
fat water snake!

39:49.536 --> 39:51.936
Delphi, come
to your senses, come on.

39:55.369 --> 39:57.203
Delphi, get up!

39:57.236 --> 39:59.503
They're here now!

40:02.503 --> 40:05.970
Oh, hi.
Catch me if you can!

40:06.003 --> 40:07.237
Yeah!

40:16.536 --> 40:18.002
Dora! Zeb!

40:18.036 --> 40:20.537
Get Delphi,
and get out of here!

40:20.570 --> 40:22.437
And bring some help soon!

40:46.470 --> 40:48.970
- Mia...
- We can't handle them alone!

40:49.003 --> 40:50.836
We need to get somebody
to help!

40:50.869 --> 40:53.304
But I can't just
leave Mia here alone!

40:53.336 --> 40:54.836
You don't have a choice!

40:54.869 --> 40:57.436
If we don't get help soon,
she's a goner.

40:57.470 --> 41:00.170
Let's get going!

41:05.569 --> 41:07.002
Hold on, Mia!

41:07.036 --> 41:09.371
We'll be back,
and we'll save you!

41:20.536 --> 41:23.403
They're getting away.

41:23.437 --> 41:25.504
Yeah.

41:25.536 --> 41:27.869
What do you think we should do
with that pink lady?

41:27.903 --> 41:30.804
- You feel like eating her?
- Yeah.

41:40.003 --> 41:45.003
Celine, do you think I'm
a good mayor or a great one?

41:45.036 --> 41:46.437
Octavian! Help!

41:46.470 --> 41:48.069
Listen to me,
the morays, they...

41:48.102 --> 41:50.002
You swam
without password again!

41:50.035 --> 41:51.869
How could you disobey me,
you wimp?!

41:51.902 --> 41:53.570
How could you
disobey Octavian?

41:53.604 --> 41:55.270
You never went
to the sunken fortress!

41:55.303 --> 41:57.571
- That's right.
- You never went there?

41:57.604 --> 41:59.571
I gave you a strict order!

41:59.603 --> 42:02.537
I know, Octavian.
But I first wanted to make sure

42:02.570 --> 42:06.037
my guards were properly trained
for such an important mission.

42:06.069 --> 42:08.236
I suppose that's prudent,
but still.

42:08.270 --> 42:11.037
It's very important
orders must be followed.

42:11.070 --> 42:14.103
That's the point;
orders, discipline, protocol.

42:14.136 --> 42:16.404
Just stop!
None of that matters now!

42:16.436 --> 42:19.102
The morays have Mia.
We need to save her!

42:19.136 --> 42:22.404
What?! My daughter
is trapped, you say?!

42:22.436 --> 42:25.303
Alpha, what the heck
does it mean?

42:25.337 --> 42:29.237
But-but, sir, Mr. Mayor,
I-I was just thinking...

42:29.269 --> 42:31.036
"Thinking"?
You can think?

42:31.070 --> 42:35.470
Yes, Alpha. Thinking is not
your strong suit, is it?

42:35.502 --> 42:37.069
I'll handle it all,
Octavian.

42:37.102 --> 42:39.136
Can you just listen to me,
please?

42:39.169 --> 42:41.902
I saw it with my own eyes.
The morays used the arch

42:41.936 --> 42:45.270
to transform and became gigantic.
They're way too strong!

42:45.302 --> 42:47.403
To conquer them,
we'll need the entire town army!

42:47.436 --> 42:49.969
You know what?
Only cowards say that.

42:50.002 --> 42:51.936
Octavian,
I will handle those eels,

42:51.969 --> 42:53.869
and I'll return
with your daughter.

42:53.902 --> 42:55.969
Now, my war
with them is personal.

42:56.003 --> 42:58.170
- Take me!
- No way, pal.

42:58.202 --> 43:00.503
I don't need marinated fish.
Get some rest.

43:00.537 --> 43:02.903
Let the professionals
do their job.

43:02.936 --> 43:05.837
You should take me with you, Alpha.
It's dangerous out there.

43:05.870 --> 43:08.136
Don't you worry.
I'll take care of myself.

43:08.169 --> 43:09.836
Without you.

43:09.870 --> 43:13.236
And don't you dare
come back without my daughter!

43:13.269 --> 43:14.970
That was
very convincing, sir.

43:15.002 --> 43:17.136
You should remember
that tone in the future.

43:32.070 --> 43:35.937
Alpha, look at that hole in the
fortress wall. It's impressive.

43:35.970 --> 43:37.470
Did Delphi really do this?

43:37.502 --> 43:40.204
Uh-huh. With his
so-called secret punch.

43:40.236 --> 43:42.002
I'm tired of you two!

43:42.035 --> 43:44.836
No more talk
of some stupid fake punch.

43:44.869 --> 43:48.102
This is an official mission
of the Fish Town Elite Guard.

43:48.136 --> 43:51.102
- Understood?
- Yes, sir. Understood, sir.

43:51.135 --> 43:52.936
Yes, that's more like it.

43:52.970 --> 43:57.004
Come on, let's go fillet those
morays and save my girlfriend.

44:02.902 --> 44:05.403
Holy mackerel!

44:05.436 --> 44:08.203
Alpha, see,
I'm kind of nervous.

44:08.237 --> 44:10.103
- Yeah, me too.
- Shut up, both of you!

44:10.136 --> 44:11.337
We're on a mission.

44:11.370 --> 44:14.103
Whazzup, fin-fellas?

44:14.135 --> 44:17.136
Are you guys staying...
for dinner?

44:29.536 --> 44:32.103
What should we do?
What should we do?

44:32.135 --> 44:33.570
What should we do?
What should we do?

44:33.603 --> 44:36.303
What should we do?
What should we do?

44:36.336 --> 44:38.902
What should we do?
What should we do?

44:38.936 --> 44:40.937
What should we do?
What should we do?

44:40.969 --> 44:44.602
Hey, you've said that
654 times in a row already.

44:44.635 --> 44:46.036
Okay,
but what should we do?

44:46.069 --> 44:47.336
That's 655.

44:49.969 --> 44:52.236
This whole thing
is all my fault!

44:52.269 --> 44:54.336
Yeah, buddy,
it's all your fault.

44:54.369 --> 44:56.136
If I hadn't punched
through that wall,

44:56.169 --> 44:58.435
if I hadn't found
that stupid arch...

44:58.469 --> 45:00.503
Yeah, if you hadn't
punched through that wall,

45:00.536 --> 45:02.237
if you hadn't found that arch.

45:02.270 --> 45:06.170
I am a hopeless rotten cod,
and I ruined everything.

45:06.203 --> 45:08.569
That's honey for my ears!

45:08.602 --> 45:11.502
Hey, don't be such a wuss!
Stop blowing bubbles!

45:11.536 --> 45:13.936
Mia is trapped!
Do something at last!

45:13.970 --> 45:16.503
Oh, yeah.
You're right, Zeb.

45:16.536 --> 45:18.404
Here's what I think:

45:18.436 --> 45:21.370
If there's water
already inside the fortress,

45:21.402 --> 45:24.904
it means that there must be
another way to get inside.

45:26.069 --> 45:27.969
And you know
what that means?

45:28.003 --> 45:30.370
The law of communicating
vessels, buddy?

45:30.401 --> 45:33.369
- Exactly.
- Hmm, you may be right somehow.

45:33.401 --> 45:36.269
The walls of the fortress
rise over the water.

45:36.303 --> 45:38.436
Yeah. We need to find
the other way in,

45:38.469 --> 45:42.170
somehow sneak inside the
fortress and then save Mia!

45:42.203 --> 45:45.570
That sounds like a plan.
But how do we find a way in?

45:45.603 --> 45:48.804
I know somebody
who may know this secret.

46:00.169 --> 46:01.936
Hi, Auntie Demetra?

46:05.369 --> 46:07.104
Auntie Demetra?

46:08.870 --> 46:10.137
Hey!

46:10.170 --> 46:11.337
What are you doing?

46:18.603 --> 46:20.103
Auntie Demetra.

46:21.536 --> 46:23.337
Dolphius?

46:23.369 --> 46:24.837
Dude.

46:24.870 --> 46:28.103
I'm so glad to see you.

46:28.135 --> 46:32.536
- No, I'm Delphi, his son.
- Oh, are you sure?

46:32.569 --> 46:34.369
Yes.

46:34.402 --> 46:36.970
Auntie Demetra, um,
do you remember...

46:37.003 --> 46:39.904
Did my father ever talk to you
about a sunken fortress?

46:41.035 --> 46:43.169
"Sunken"?

46:43.202 --> 46:48.103
Well, there're-there're
different kinds of sunken.

46:48.135 --> 46:50.870
If you suffer
from sunken eyes,

46:50.902 --> 46:52.070
get some rest, my boy.

46:52.102 --> 46:54.502
And if you have
sunken abdomen,

46:54.536 --> 46:56.136
then you should eat more.

46:56.169 --> 46:57.902
Ah, come on,
let's swim.

46:57.935 --> 46:59.103
She doesn't know
anything.

46:59.135 --> 47:02.136
Auntie Demetra,
we don't have much time.

47:02.170 --> 47:03.970
I think I should get swimming.

47:04.003 --> 47:07.137
Then swim, boy,
but I just want to say

47:07.169 --> 47:10.435
that you really look
like Dolphius.

47:10.469 --> 47:14.369
Are you absolutely sure
you're not him?

47:14.402 --> 47:17.837
I am. And I'm sorry
I bothered you.

47:17.870 --> 47:20.170
I really have to swim.

47:20.203 --> 47:23.236
Your father
used to come visit me

47:23.269 --> 47:26.169
and told me
about an old fortress.

47:26.202 --> 47:27.903
An old fortress?

47:27.936 --> 47:29.602
That's-that's what
I was asking you about.

47:29.635 --> 47:31.602
You should have said so!

47:31.635 --> 47:36.368
Why on Earth would you go on
about your sunken abdomen?

47:36.401 --> 47:38.036
Anyway...

47:45.203 --> 47:48.870
<i>He swam through some
hidden tunnel and, um...</i>

47:48.902 --> 47:53.036
<i>and found some pyramids
and arches inside.</i>

48:02.569 --> 48:04.402
What can it be?

48:24.236 --> 48:26.268
<i>Dolphius told me</i>

48:26.301 --> 48:30.102
<i>that the stone was thrown
by him through the Arch.</i>

48:30.135 --> 48:36.169
<i>It looked as if it had been in
the water for many, many years.</i>

48:36.203 --> 48:40.103
<i>It was like the stone
went back in time.</i>

48:40.136 --> 48:43.869
<i>So, he realized that this arch</i>

48:43.903 --> 48:47.469
<i>sends you back to the past.</i>

48:47.501 --> 48:52.268
<i>He then found another pyramid
within the fortress</i>

48:52.302 --> 48:55.335
<i>with another arch in it.</i>

48:55.368 --> 49:00.136
<i>Dolphius decided to try it out
with another stone.</i>

49:00.170 --> 49:02.569
<i>The stone disappeared.</i>

49:06.302 --> 49:10.170
<i>And Dolphius assumed
that this arch</i>

49:10.202 --> 49:13.270
<i>sends things to the future.</i>

49:15.435 --> 49:20.036
Consequently,
if he goes back to the past,

49:20.070 --> 49:22.303
he would be able to come back.

49:22.335 --> 49:25.970
He wanted to try
his theory out.

49:26.003 --> 49:27.403
That's just incredible!

49:27.435 --> 49:30.202
Auntie Demetra, you're a genius!
Unbelievable!

49:30.235 --> 49:32.235
Finally, I know
where my father went.

49:32.269 --> 49:35.936
Did he, by any chance,
say where the tunnel was?

49:35.969 --> 49:38.936
Where? Where?

49:38.970 --> 49:43.369
Yeah, he did.
That's right.

49:43.401 --> 49:48.037
It's... it's near
some funny thing.

49:48.069 --> 49:52.602
I've been laughing
for three days straight!

49:58.134 --> 50:00.368
Or was it four days?

50:00.402 --> 50:02.070
Ah...

50:02.102 --> 50:04.569
Near the legged fish!

50:04.603 --> 50:07.269
Yeah, that's really funny.

50:07.301 --> 50:08.903
Thank you,
we got it now.

50:10.035 --> 50:11.569
My pleasure.

50:11.603 --> 50:17.536
And don't forget to tell
your little son hi, Dolphius.

50:17.568 --> 50:21.235
Uh-huh, he sure will.
I'll remind him.

50:24.369 --> 50:29.870
Well, well, well...
It's marvelous, isn't it?

50:29.902 --> 50:33.235
It's absolutely fantastic!

50:33.268 --> 50:35.435
I don't believe my eyes!

50:35.469 --> 50:38.402
So, you're saying

50:38.435 --> 50:42.070
that this magic arch
turned you into a giant?

50:42.101 --> 50:45.602
That's correct,
my underwater Majesty.

50:45.636 --> 50:48.070
Bob and Pete are guarding it.

50:48.101 --> 50:52.469
I love it when the day ends
with some delightful news.

50:54.169 --> 50:56.569
Fish Town
will soon be ours.

50:56.602 --> 50:59.268
And I will call it
Moray-ville!

50:59.302 --> 51:02.902
Hooray!
Long live Moray-ville!

51:02.936 --> 51:06.470
- Long live Morenius!
- Long live Morenius!

51:07.969 --> 51:10.135
We barely got away.

51:10.169 --> 51:14.403
Somehow those morays transformed
themselves into huge monsters.

51:14.435 --> 51:18.036
So Delphi
was telling the truth.

51:18.069 --> 51:20.937
Okay, we need a plan.

51:20.969 --> 51:22.603
I know exactly
what to do.

51:22.636 --> 51:25.136
You, Alpha,
had enough chances

51:25.169 --> 51:27.469
to prove your worth,
but you failed.

51:29.902 --> 51:31.335
Seahorses, your opinion.

51:33.436 --> 51:37.602
Well, we could let's say,
hide somewhere?

51:37.635 --> 51:39.503
That's not a plan!

51:39.535 --> 51:42.036
Fish Town is in actual,
imminent danger.

51:42.069 --> 51:45.203
Manta, do you perhaps
have a suggestion?

51:45.236 --> 51:47.469
Hm, I have an idea.

51:47.502 --> 51:52.236
We could somehow slowly adapt,
grow lungs, learn to breath air.

51:52.269 --> 51:54.937
Eventually, our fins
would turn to legs,

51:54.970 --> 51:57.936
and we could all become
land dwellers.

51:57.970 --> 52:00.269
Too evolutionary!

52:00.302 --> 52:01.603
Is there anybody else?

52:01.635 --> 52:04.068
We... we have a plan!

52:04.101 --> 52:06.068
- I'm sure there's a way...
- Not you again!

52:06.101 --> 52:09.235
This is all his fault
since the very beginning.

52:09.268 --> 52:13.202
If it hadn't been for Delphi,
Mia would be completely safe.

52:13.235 --> 52:15.135
Now that you mention it, Alpha,

52:15.168 --> 52:17.168
Mia would never have gone
to the old fortress

52:17.202 --> 52:19.236
if you had followed Octavian's
order like you should...

52:19.269 --> 52:20.869
That's enough!

52:20.902 --> 52:23.368
It doesn't matter who
should be blamed for this.

52:23.401 --> 52:26.602
Fish Town is in danger,
and we need a plan!

52:26.635 --> 52:28.969
That's exactly
what I'm trying to tell you!

52:29.002 --> 52:30.368
We have a plan.

52:30.401 --> 52:34.102
Fine then. You may speak.

52:34.134 --> 52:37.302
My father found a secret passage
into the old fortress,

52:37.336 --> 52:39.569
and inside,
there're two more arches

52:39.602 --> 52:42.202
that make it possible
to time travel!

52:42.235 --> 52:45.135
We need to go back in time
where there're no giant morays.

52:45.169 --> 52:48.503
Then we can get bigger, and leap in
time to now, and kick the morays' tails!

52:48.535 --> 52:52.535
I think that Manta's plan
is much more likely to happen.

52:55.336 --> 52:58.336
Your plan
is absolute nonsense.

52:58.369 --> 52:59.837
Admit it, Delphi.

52:59.870 --> 53:01.603
Do you need me
to tell you again?

53:01.636 --> 53:04.169
Your Dad disappeared
and never came back.

53:04.202 --> 53:07.436
There's no way
he should be our inspiration.

53:07.469 --> 53:11.269
- Yeah, but...
- No more "buts."

53:11.302 --> 53:13.303
Now, listen to my plan.

53:13.336 --> 53:16.101
The morays will definitely
come back to the fortress

53:16.134 --> 53:18.602
to get transformed
and become invincible.

53:18.636 --> 53:21.069
We have to fight them
before it happens.

53:21.102 --> 53:22.436
The fortress and the town

53:22.469 --> 53:24.935
can only be accessed
from the north or the south.

53:24.969 --> 53:28.569
We're protected by underwater
rocks from the east and west.

53:28.602 --> 53:30.368
They won't attack from the south

53:30.401 --> 53:33.935
because they would have to make
a long trip lasting a few days.

53:33.969 --> 53:38.570
So that means the morays will
be attacking from the north.

53:38.603 --> 53:43.136
<i>They will take the shortest way
through a mountain range,</i>

53:43.169 --> 53:44.870
with only one narrow passage.

53:46.368 --> 53:49.302
<i>We have to meet them
in this very passage.</i>

53:49.335 --> 53:52.935
The morays don't know that we
have figured out their plan.

53:52.968 --> 53:54.435
We'll defeat the morays,

53:54.469 --> 53:56.302
and then we'll get back
to the fortress,

53:56.335 --> 53:57.935
and save Mia!

54:00.369 --> 54:02.269
At last. A plan!

54:02.302 --> 54:05.103
Trumpeters, sound the horns!

54:13.169 --> 54:15.869
It's not gonna work!
Hey, it's not gonna work!

54:15.902 --> 54:18.135
- Shut up, Delphi.
- This plan will fail!

54:18.168 --> 54:20.268
One of them
is really enormous.

54:20.302 --> 54:23.268
Please, Octavian.
Believe me, it's important.

54:33.935 --> 54:37.203
Fine, then.
I'll go back in time myself.

54:37.236 --> 54:39.936
- Alone.
- No, I'm going with you.

54:39.968 --> 54:42.535
It's too dangerous.
What if I'm wrong?

54:42.568 --> 54:45.136
Do you understand
we might never come back?

54:45.168 --> 54:48.169
What do you mean, bro?
We will get back.

54:48.201 --> 54:49.570
I believe in you.

54:49.603 --> 54:51.602
- You do?
- Of course.

54:51.635 --> 54:55.235
What other
choice do I have?

54:55.269 --> 54:57.335
Then let's go!

55:11.969 --> 55:13.368
We're losing time.

55:13.401 --> 55:15.336
Where could this tunnel be?

55:17.569 --> 55:20.203
Maybe Demetra made
some kind of mistake?

55:20.236 --> 55:23.169
What? Aunt Dementia?
Mistaken?

55:23.201 --> 55:26.135
No way. You're wrong.

55:26.169 --> 55:28.136
That can't be.

55:28.169 --> 55:32.101
Her sharp mind
can be an example to...

55:32.134 --> 55:33.435
Hold on a sec.

55:33.468 --> 55:35.537
Didn't that look like a...

55:39.335 --> 55:40.935
Look here!

55:40.969 --> 55:43.068
There's a sign on the stone.

55:43.101 --> 55:47.402
Just like the one on the arch.
You've got a good eye, Zeb.

55:47.436 --> 55:51.069
Okay, and what will happen
if I try and...

55:51.102 --> 55:53.136
No, no, no!
What? Don't do that!

55:53.169 --> 55:54.835
We should not...

56:10.636 --> 56:12.402
Hello?

56:12.436 --> 56:15.503
Is anybody there?

56:17.002 --> 56:22.002
Uh... maybe you go first
and then me?

56:22.035 --> 56:25.969
You see, because, uh, you're the
muscles, and I am the brain.

56:26.002 --> 56:29.203
And the brain
must be taken care of.

56:29.236 --> 56:31.603
Oh, yeah?
You're right.

56:52.302 --> 56:55.169
Look, it must be the
entrance to the pyramid.

56:55.201 --> 56:56.436
Let's swim.

56:59.968 --> 57:01.868
- Uh-oh.
- Let's get outta here!

57:07.135 --> 57:09.836
Delphi, there's something
I have to tell you.

57:09.869 --> 57:13.203
Do you remember how you lost your
Dolph-cathlon cards when you were kid?

57:15.502 --> 57:18.336
Well, you didn't lose them.
They were stolen.

57:18.368 --> 57:20.135
Who stole them?
What are you talking about?

57:20.169 --> 57:22.203
One very little,
but very nice fish!

57:22.236 --> 57:24.002
He wanted to give them
back to you,

57:24.034 --> 57:27.035
but never got a chance to
because...

57:27.068 --> 57:31.935
...a huge ball squeezed him
into clam chowder!

57:31.969 --> 57:33.936
No, it didn't!

57:41.168 --> 57:46.935
Phew. I think I now know
the origins of the flatfish.

57:59.202 --> 58:02.869
Holy mackerel!
Where are we?

58:02.901 --> 58:05.436
Where we need to be.
Look over there.

58:06.868 --> 58:08.001
This is it.

58:08.034 --> 58:11.236
The arch that sends you
into the past.

58:11.268 --> 58:13.370
And here's the stone
that he threw.

58:14.468 --> 58:17.036
It's just
like Demetra told us.

58:17.068 --> 58:18.969
The second pyramid
is out there

58:19.001 --> 58:23.902
and in it, the arch that
will bring us back to now.

58:23.935 --> 58:27.535
Listen, maybe we can just transform
now without any time travel.

58:27.569 --> 58:29.503
I'm not afraid, but the morays
may be asleep...

58:29.535 --> 58:31.268
No, it's way too risky.

58:31.301 --> 58:33.935
If they notice us,
we'll become fish and chips.

58:33.968 --> 58:35.335
Uh, another idea.

58:35.369 --> 58:38.069
You swim in there,
and I'll stay here.

58:38.102 --> 58:40.236
Here, I'll handle all the hard work.
That's right.

58:40.268 --> 58:43.403
I will, by myself, make sure
our mission runs smoothly.

58:43.436 --> 58:45.969
And you...
You'll be safe there.

58:46.001 --> 58:48.570
And you'll get back to me
at once.

58:48.602 --> 58:52.035
Uh, but just in case,
my friend, goodbye.

58:52.068 --> 58:54.868
Okay, now
I have to do it.

58:54.902 --> 58:56.370
Goodbye, Zeb.

58:58.201 --> 59:02.036
Delphi, uh, you're not
serious about this, are you?

59:10.902 --> 59:13.102
Delphi, stop,
don't do it.

59:13.134 --> 59:18.035
You have to try it out first!

59:19.101 --> 59:21.202
Delphi!

59:22.268 --> 59:25.101
Delphi, where are you?

59:25.134 --> 59:26.901
He's gone.

59:26.935 --> 59:28.369
He really went back in time.

59:28.401 --> 59:30.935
And I thought
it was all nonsense.

59:30.969 --> 59:32.836
I shouldn't have
let him go alone.

59:32.869 --> 59:34.902
He'll get into hot water,
like he always does,

59:34.934 --> 59:36.370
and I'll have to chill it.

59:44.968 --> 59:46.502
Huh?

59:46.535 --> 59:47.535
Delphi?

59:48.902 --> 59:49.969
Delphi?

59:51.002 --> 59:52.303
Where are you?

59:54.169 --> 59:56.901
Am I... in the past now?

59:56.934 --> 59:58.069
Or not?

01:00:01.501 --> 01:00:03.035
I'm stuck.

01:00:07.502 --> 01:00:09.436
Did you get scared there?

01:00:09.469 --> 01:00:11.569
Me? Uh, I would never.

01:00:11.602 --> 01:00:13.169
It was my battle-cry.

01:00:13.201 --> 01:00:16.001
I just didn't want
to leave you alone here.

01:00:16.035 --> 01:00:17.569
You'd better stay.

01:00:17.601 --> 01:00:20.203
It seems we have a
serious problem here, Zeb.

01:00:20.235 --> 01:00:22.235
- A problem?
- Yeah.

01:00:22.268 --> 01:00:25.035
We're inside the pyramid,
but the exit is blocked.

01:00:31.868 --> 01:00:34.501
It's no use, Zeb.
I already tried myself.

01:00:34.534 --> 01:00:37.335
Uh... Let's agree
right away, okay?

01:00:37.369 --> 01:00:41.136
No matter how hungry you get,
you won't eat me.

01:00:41.169 --> 01:00:44.569
Some of my ancestors, you
know, were really poisonous!

01:00:44.602 --> 01:00:46.569
We have a deal, Delphi?

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:49.901
Delphi? My son!

01:00:49.935 --> 01:00:52.303
- Dad?
- You're here!

01:00:52.336 --> 01:00:54.869
I don't believe it.
Is that you?

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:58.335
And I started to think
I had lost you.

01:00:58.369 --> 01:00:59.836
I missed you so.

01:00:59.869 --> 01:01:02.036
Whoa, Mr. Dolphius.

01:01:02.068 --> 01:01:06.101
And we thought you kind
of turned into fish food.

01:01:06.135 --> 01:01:09.002
Hello, Zeb.
How did you two get here?

01:01:09.034 --> 01:01:10.835
You won't believe it.

01:01:10.869 --> 01:01:14.468
We went through the hidden
tunnel, found the arch, and...

01:01:14.501 --> 01:01:17.534
Oh, I see.
Exactly what I feared.

01:01:17.567 --> 01:01:19.168
Delphi, let me explain.

01:01:19.202 --> 01:01:21.936
The exit from this pyramid
in our time is open,

01:01:21.969 --> 01:01:24.102
but in the past
it's somehow locked.

01:01:24.135 --> 01:01:26.002
I just haven't
managed to open it.

01:01:26.035 --> 01:01:28.403
But we can try to swim
through the tunnel.

01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:31.535
I've tried it,
but that exit is blocked, too.

01:01:31.567 --> 01:01:34.335
And why don't we try swimming
through the arch one more time?

01:01:34.368 --> 01:01:36.534
Mm-mm.
It doesn't work.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:39.303
That means now we're trapped.

01:01:39.336 --> 01:01:41.368
Unfortunately.

01:01:41.401 --> 01:01:44.335
But I'm so proud of you, my
son, that you could find me.

01:01:44.369 --> 01:01:46.135
I've been digging
a new tunnel for a year.

01:01:48.434 --> 01:01:50.236
Maybe you can help me
with this.

01:01:50.268 --> 01:01:52.268
But we have no time
for a tunnel.

01:01:52.301 --> 01:01:54.135
No time? But why?

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:56.402
Father, let me
explain it to you.

01:02:14.568 --> 01:02:16.369
Brothers and sisters,

01:02:16.401 --> 01:02:19.936
this is it, the moment
that we have trained for!

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:23.968
This is going to be the most
important battle of our lives.

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:27.568
The enemy is very strong,
but we can't let them pass.

01:02:27.602 --> 01:02:30.401
Because otherwise,
if we don't stop them...

01:02:34.101 --> 01:02:35.434
Our Fish Town will perish.

01:02:35.467 --> 01:02:37.269
We may sacrifice our lives,

01:02:37.301 --> 01:02:39.968
but we'll never
let them through!

01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:45.136
Don't you think
he's too emotional?

01:02:46.135 --> 01:02:49.001
Now, guards, citizens,

01:02:49.034 --> 01:02:52.568
for Fish Town, attack!

01:02:58.435 --> 01:03:01.535
If these kids
want to play the game,

01:03:01.568 --> 01:03:03.868
let's kick their tails then!

01:03:03.901 --> 01:03:06.802
Attack!
Let's destroy them!

01:03:24.202 --> 01:03:26.069
Delphi, you have
a great plan,

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:27.969
but how do we
get it into action?

01:03:28.002 --> 01:03:30.136
Dad, for sure
we'll think of something

01:03:30.168 --> 01:03:31.502
now that we're together again.

01:03:31.534 --> 01:03:34.068
Delphi, there should be
a way out!

01:03:34.101 --> 01:03:37.202
I think it's somewhere
right under our very noses.

01:03:37.236 --> 01:03:40.135
- Mm-hmm.
- And that's why we can't see it.

01:03:40.169 --> 01:03:42.501
Hm, right under your nose.

01:03:42.534 --> 01:03:45.334
Hm. Mm-hmm.

01:03:45.368 --> 01:03:48.535
If you can't find a way out,
that means you have to make one.

01:03:55.534 --> 01:03:59.169
Mommy, Mommy, please,
let me ride a seahorse.

01:04:00.601 --> 01:04:03.935
Yeah, me too.

01:04:13.902 --> 01:04:15.602
Come on!

01:04:18.634 --> 01:04:20.967
I hope Delphi
will think of something

01:04:20.969 --> 01:04:25.068
and that he will be back
as he promised.

01:04:45.435 --> 01:04:47.869
What? Huh?
No, no, we don't sleep.

01:04:47.902 --> 01:04:50.469
- Yeah, we're awake.
- We're awake. Yeah.

01:05:01.602 --> 01:05:03.402
What are you doing?

01:05:07.068 --> 01:05:11.068
Stop tickling me!

01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:25.836
Our plan is working well.
Now, it's your turn, Nik.

01:05:33.968 --> 01:05:36.035
Hey, let's finish this!

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:40.969
Hey, everyone!

01:05:41.001 --> 01:05:42.302
The name is Nik.

01:05:42.334 --> 01:05:45.368
Sorry I'm a bit late.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.136
But I'll serve all of ya.

01:05:48.168 --> 01:05:51.467
Yes, who's up
for teeth pulling?

01:05:51.501 --> 01:05:54.335
Who wants to fix their nasal septum?

01:05:54.368 --> 01:05:57.101
I'm your eel!

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.001
Well, who's next, huh?

01:06:03.135 --> 01:06:04.836
I know what I have to do.

01:06:05.634 --> 01:06:07.367
What is your plan, Delphi?

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.402
I'll use my secret punch.

01:06:09.434 --> 01:06:12.368
Blast my gizzard!
You're right, friend.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.068
Mr. Dolphius,
don't you worry.

01:06:16.102 --> 01:06:19.936
Your brilliant son will show
you a marvelous trick now.

01:06:19.968 --> 01:06:20.868
Ta-da!

01:06:32.268 --> 01:06:34.302
Uncle Dolphius,
hold me tight!

01:06:40.102 --> 01:06:42.002
Well, what did I
tell ya?

01:06:42.034 --> 01:06:44.535
Diggity-dolphin!
What a punch, son.

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:47.268
Boy, I didn't even know
you had it in you.

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.869
- But...
- Hah! He's got a whole lot more in him, you know!

01:06:49.901 --> 01:06:52.301
C'mon, stop it, Zeb.
We gotta hurry.

01:06:52.335 --> 01:06:55.301
We have no time for babbling.
We need to rescue Mia!

01:07:09.101 --> 01:07:11.002
Come on, Mia, a little more.

01:07:12.368 --> 01:07:13.903
Hello.

01:07:14.902 --> 01:07:16.168
And bye!

01:07:34.601 --> 01:07:37.935
The arch of transformations!
It will help me!

01:07:39.534 --> 01:07:41.502
I will show you!

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:53.434
- Ladies...
- Hm?

01:07:53.468 --> 01:07:56.135
Yoo-hoo.
If I were your size,

01:07:56.168 --> 01:07:59.369
I would consider
going on a low carb diet.

01:08:00.901 --> 01:08:04.001
He's gonna make
fish sticks out of us.

01:08:04.034 --> 01:08:05.467
Uh, yeah.

01:08:05.501 --> 01:08:07.035
Banzai!

01:08:14.133 --> 01:08:16.134
Mia, are you hurt?

01:08:16.167 --> 01:08:18.167
No.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.033
Delphi? Is that you?

01:08:22.068 --> 01:08:25.134
Well, yeah. It's me,
just a bit bigger, that's all.

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:28.268
Hello, Mia.
You're all grown up now.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.902
Mr. Dolphius?

01:08:31.901 --> 01:08:34.835
Hey-hey. And here am I.

01:08:34.868 --> 01:08:38.868
- Zeb!
- In the flesh!

01:08:38.902 --> 01:08:42.001
Mia, we have to rush
to help Alpha and Octavian.

01:08:42.033 --> 01:08:44.301
Sure, just a moment.

01:08:44.334 --> 01:08:48.535
I... I want to
transform myself, too.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.267
Get away from here,
you nasty morays!

01:09:09.969 --> 01:09:14.501
So, what? Are you satisfied?
Or do you ask for more?

01:09:14.535 --> 01:09:17.935
Hey, you, get away
from my commander!

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.401
So, what will you
say now, huh?

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:32.935
Huh? How did Delphi do that?

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:51.067
Oh, ho! This secret punch
really works!

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.903
Dolphin guards, attack!

01:10:02.602 --> 01:10:06.234
Retreat! Retreat!

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:11.501
Cowards!

01:10:11.535 --> 01:10:12.968
It's a dangerous
maneuver.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.334
They can sneak up
on us.

01:10:14.368 --> 01:10:17.402
Doesn't matter.
Victory is ours.

01:10:17.434 --> 01:10:19.034
Attack!

01:10:28.435 --> 01:10:31.468
Let 'em have it,
so that they never come back!

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:35.201
Don't hurry now,
Octavian.

01:10:37.268 --> 01:10:39.568
What? Udo?

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:43.100
Of course it's me.

01:10:43.134 --> 01:10:46.901
It was all planned
like this from the start.

01:10:46.934 --> 01:10:51.435
I knew you'd chase them
and fall into my trap.

01:10:53.401 --> 01:10:57.968
The tides have turned
against you now, Octavian.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.502
- Celine, did you get anything?
- Of course I get it.

01:11:02.535 --> 01:11:04.868
We've just been served
to the sharks for dinner.

01:11:04.901 --> 01:11:10.235
Holy calamaries! I'm going
to be octopus soup.

01:11:11.535 --> 01:11:14.035
That's right.

01:11:14.067 --> 01:11:16.867
Sharks, attack him now!

01:11:19.535 --> 01:11:23.602
Hah! Not so fast,
you swimming seal burp!

01:11:23.634 --> 01:11:25.967
And who are you?

01:11:26.001 --> 01:11:29.067
I am the terror
that flaps in the sea!

01:11:29.101 --> 01:11:34.334
I am an angel fish
from the underworld!

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.401
That wasn't
in our contract!

01:11:47.435 --> 01:11:49.569
Hey, there, Alpha.

01:11:49.601 --> 01:11:51.868
Delphi, is that you?

01:11:53.033 --> 01:11:55.834
This means your plan
actually worked.

01:11:55.868 --> 01:11:58.901
Good job, soldier,
thanks for your help.

01:11:58.933 --> 01:12:01.234
We would be clam chowder
without you.

01:12:01.267 --> 01:12:04.868
Yeah, we did it together.
We won the battle.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.102
Thanks for holding
those morays up, Alpha.

01:12:17.168 --> 01:12:18.834
Victory?

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:20.534
Victory!

01:12:20.568 --> 01:12:23.169
Yes, my victory!

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.468
Congratulations, Delphi.

01:12:38.467 --> 01:12:42.234
Everyone admitted
you were right.

01:12:42.268 --> 01:12:45.502
I always knew
inside a dreamer's chest

01:12:45.534 --> 01:12:47.434
beats the heart
of a hero.

01:12:48.968 --> 01:12:50.435
Thanks, Mia.

01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:52.501
But don't you have
a wedding to get ready for?

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:54.435
I guess.

01:12:54.467 --> 01:12:57.334
I wanted to talk about
that, by the way.

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.934
Before I swim
down the aisle,

01:13:01.968 --> 01:13:04.101
I just need
to know something.

01:13:04.133 --> 01:13:05.968
What "something"?

01:13:07.235 --> 01:13:08.569
Oh, nothing.

01:13:10.335 --> 01:13:12.000
What's wrong with you?

01:13:12.034 --> 01:13:14.835
You weren't like this when
you were trying to save me.

01:13:14.867 --> 01:13:18.001
Yeah, well, it was a different
situation back there.

01:13:18.033 --> 01:13:20.034
You were in serious danger,
and I...

01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:24.801
I see. Well, then,
I should swim.

01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:29.602
Uh, yeah.

01:13:29.634 --> 01:13:30.902
See ya.

01:13:33.268 --> 01:13:35.569
- Mia!
- Yes?!

01:13:35.601 --> 01:13:38.834
- What?
- N-nothing.

01:13:38.868 --> 01:13:42.035
I wanted...
to congratulate you.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.135
Fool! Fool! Fool! Fool!

01:13:48.168 --> 01:13:50.068
Why I am such a loser?

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.569
Delphi, don't be
so hard on yourself.

01:13:52.601 --> 01:13:54.301
Of course
you're not a loser.

01:13:54.335 --> 01:13:56.268
You are the dumbest dolphin
there can be!

01:13:56.301 --> 01:13:58.234
You've just lost
the love of your life!

01:13:58.268 --> 01:14:00.901
It's not too late
to make up for it, son.

01:14:00.933 --> 01:14:02.934
You can do it.
Don't give up.

01:14:02.967 --> 01:14:06.302
Just find her, and tell her what
you've always wanted to say.

01:14:06.334 --> 01:14:07.601
Don't you think
it's impossible?

01:14:07.635 --> 01:14:10.935
It's possible!
It's all in your own fins.

01:14:10.967 --> 01:14:13.134
Remember.
Sometimes, Delphi,

01:14:13.168 --> 01:14:16.601
even the wildest of
dreams come true.

01:14:16.635 --> 01:14:19.201
"Even the wildest of dreams."

01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:23.035
Yeah, I like it.

01:14:33.334 --> 01:14:36.235
We are gathered here today

01:14:36.267 --> 01:14:38.234
to celebrate the wedding

01:14:38.268 --> 01:14:41.334
of our mayor's
stepdaughter, Mia,

01:14:41.368 --> 01:14:46.401
and the leader of the Elite
Dolphin Guard, Alpha.

01:14:46.435 --> 01:14:50.268
Does anybody object
against this marriage?

01:14:50.301 --> 01:14:52.835
If so, say it now.

01:14:52.867 --> 01:14:55.135
I do.

01:14:55.168 --> 01:14:57.968
No, my dear.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.601
The "I do's" should be said
after the consecration.

01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:06.167
- Wait...
- No, no, no! I do object!

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:10.001
Now it's hardly
time to object, dear.

01:15:10.033 --> 01:15:15.134
- Now, can we continue?
- Yes, I shall proceed.

01:15:15.167 --> 01:15:16.967
Wait!

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.968
I'm-I'm not done yet!

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.600
You see, Father,
I'm-I'm just not sure.

01:15:24.633 --> 01:15:27.867
I mean, I just don't know.
I mean...

01:15:27.901 --> 01:15:30.900
What is it now, my dear?
Spit it out.

01:15:30.934 --> 01:15:32.901
- I...
- I love you, Mia!

01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:35.401
That's incredible!

01:15:35.435 --> 01:15:37.301
I just needed to tell you
how I felt

01:15:37.335 --> 01:15:39.901
before it was too late.

01:15:39.934 --> 01:15:42.901
I've loved you since the
very first time I saw you.

01:15:42.933 --> 01:15:45.367
I'll never be
a macho guy like Alpha.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.100
I'm not a warrior,
I'm just a dreamer.

01:15:49.133 --> 01:15:52.834
But all my wildest dreams
are about you.

01:15:53.934 --> 01:15:55.968
Mia, tell me,
will you marry me?

01:15:57.467 --> 01:16:00.934
Yes. I love you too, Delphi.

01:16:00.968 --> 01:16:04.168
Alpha, hmm,
you gotta do something!

01:16:04.201 --> 01:16:06.335
I think you just
lost a fiancée.

01:16:06.368 --> 01:16:10.401
Octavian, it seems to me
this plan about our marriage

01:16:10.435 --> 01:16:15.267
was not right
since the very beginning.

01:16:15.301 --> 01:16:16.968
Dora...

01:16:17.001 --> 01:16:19.002
I just wanna say...

01:16:21.134 --> 01:16:23.369
You saved my life and...

01:16:27.534 --> 01:16:30.935
Listen...
let's get married.

01:16:32.468 --> 01:16:34.901
I promise I'll be
the best husband

01:16:34.934 --> 01:16:37.068
you could ever find
in the ocean.

01:16:42.334 --> 01:16:46.435
I'll... marry you.

01:17:01.467 --> 01:17:05.567
Ah... Oh, well... Then...

01:17:06.901 --> 01:17:09.435
I have nothing
more to do...

01:17:09.467 --> 01:17:11.500
than to...

01:17:11.534 --> 01:17:15.068
to decree a double wedding!

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:17.435
A double wedding, you say?

01:17:17.468 --> 01:17:19.868
- Wait, a double wedding?
- Double wedding?

01:17:19.901 --> 01:17:21.335
Fine, then.

01:17:21.367 --> 01:17:26.533
Just don't forget to double
my payment for that.

01:17:40.499 --> 01:17:43.000
By the power vested in me,

01:17:43.034 --> 01:17:47.335
I now pronounce you
husbands and wives.

01:19:48.204 --> 01:19:53.204
