06:59.542 --> 07:01.249
I want some alcohol.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.521
She's still wearing

07:02.522 --> 07:03.792
10-inch stilettos.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.583
She's dropping it like it's hot

07:05.625 --> 07:06.625
and picking it up

07:06.626 --> 07:07.875
like it was on sale.

07:07.917 --> 07:09.291
None of it makes sense

07:09.292 --> 07:11.125
and I think she's exaggerating

07:11.167 --> 07:12.417
to get attention.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.292
- So, what's going on.
- With you and Jessica?

07:14.295 --> 07:15.792
We had the most amazing night,

07:15.793 --> 07:17.291
all night.

07:17.292 --> 07:18.457
All night?

07:18.458 --> 07:20.750
You know what I'm saying?

07:20.792 --> 07:22.208
- Right now, me and Jessica.
- Are getting back.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.521
To being, you know,

07:23.522 --> 07:24.791
frisky and playful.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.042
Let's bone in the car.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.375
Sure.

07:28.417 --> 07:29.667
We didn't actually bone

07:29.668 --> 07:30.917
in the car.

07:30.958 --> 07:32.957
You can't really function

07:32.958 --> 07:34.292
- and then you had.
- The uber driver there.

07:34.295 --> 07:36.542
- I didn't want him.
- To f... ing see my wife naked.

07:36.583 --> 07:38.083
Clearly, things must be going

07:38.125 --> 07:39.457
in the right direction.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.250
I turned it up a bit.

07:41.292 --> 07:42.292
It was exciting

07:42.293 --> 07:43.458
and hopefully, it'll flourish,

07:43.500 --> 07:44.583
we'll see.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.458
Thank you so much.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.229
I literally,

07:48.230 --> 07:49.958
my hands had an orgasm.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.166
Damn, my nails look so good.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.500
I need to finger somebody.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.750
Dudes do that too?

07:55.792 --> 07:57.458
- You didn't know?
- Nah.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.583
[Music playing]

08:16.000 --> 08:17.063
Hello.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.125
Hello.

08:18.167 --> 08:19.917
- How are you?
- I'm good.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.500
Good to see you guys.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.000
- Thank you.
- Hello, Tommy.

08:23.042 --> 08:24.417
- How you been?
- I'm good, I'm good.

08:24.458 --> 08:26.333
- How are you?
- So, Tommy, will you sit here?

08:26.336 --> 08:27.563
Sure.

08:27.564 --> 08:28.792
So,

08:28.833 --> 08:29.917
was there any conflicts

08:29.918 --> 08:31.000
this week,

08:31.042 --> 08:32.375
- anything you wanna.
- Sort of, like,

08:32.378 --> 08:35.667
Clean up and understand?

08:35.708 --> 08:36.833
We had a bad fight

08:36.875 --> 08:38.333
but she came to her senses,

08:38.375 --> 08:40.333
- she realized she was wrong.
- What?

08:40.375 --> 08:41.375
Are you joking right now?

08:41.417 --> 08:42.500
No, not at all.

08:42.542 --> 08:44.207
I'm dying to know

08:44.208 --> 08:46.707
what argument

08:46.708 --> 08:47.771
I checked myself

08:47.772 --> 08:48.833
that I was wrong.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.333
I just... because we bicker.

08:50.375 --> 08:53.374
Tommy and I adore one another

08:53.375 --> 08:55.333
but we also fight

08:55.375 --> 08:56.375
like cats and dogs.

08:56.376 --> 08:58.000
I mean, it's like striking

08:58.042 --> 08:59.542
a match and boom,

08:59.583 --> 09:00.874
and it ain't pretty.

09:00.875 --> 09:02.000
When she's in a mood,

09:02.042 --> 09:03.500
I can see it in her eyes.

09:03.542 --> 09:04.709
It's a tornado

09:04.710 --> 09:05.875
where she just yells

09:05.917 --> 09:07.625
- and she, you know,
- she'll ridicule you.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.042
She'll try to make you feel bad.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.500
In the grand scheme of things,

09:10.542 --> 09:11.708
they're insignificant things.

09:11.750 --> 09:12.750
Just let it go.

09:12.792 --> 09:14.000
I know your goal

09:14.001 --> 09:15.208
is to stop the fight

09:15.250 --> 09:16.417
but when you deny

09:16.418 --> 09:17.582
the little stuff,

09:17.583 --> 09:18.875
that's when you're in trouble.

09:18.917 --> 09:20.582
She needs to be able to say

09:20.583 --> 09:21.917
what she needs and wants.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.582
I need you to understand

09:23.583 --> 09:24.917
that if I'm sharing

09:24.918 --> 09:26.249
my life with you,

09:26.250 --> 09:27.417
it's not okay to laugh

09:27.418 --> 09:28.582
everything off.

09:28.583 --> 09:29.708
Okay.

09:31.292 --> 09:32.521
I want to feel

09:32.522 --> 09:33.749
like I'm an adult

09:33.750 --> 09:34.833
with an adult.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.208
I wanna have a baby with you,

09:36.250 --> 09:39.542
not adopt you as my baby.

09:39.583 --> 09:40.750
We're on the same team,

09:40.792 --> 09:42.416
so when she comes at me,

09:42.417 --> 09:44.249
it's like... first off,

09:44.250 --> 09:45.917
- she doesn't do that.
- With anybody else in her life.

09:45.958 --> 09:47.416
Who else do I live with?

09:47.417 --> 09:50.750
I need some motherf... ing slack.

09:50.792 --> 09:52.042
This is the thing

09:52.043 --> 09:53.291
that she does.

09:53.292 --> 09:55.417
I think we know what that is.

09:56.625 --> 09:58.124
Is it vida?

09:58.125 --> 09:59.208
Yes.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.584
We all become

10:00.585 --> 10:01.917
the shadowiest parts

10:01.958 --> 10:03.124
of our parent.

10:03.125 --> 10:05.042
- Like, I see it.
- And I tell her that.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.042
- When she rips me.
- And doesn't stop.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.124
And she's relentless,

10:08.125 --> 10:09.791
if i... if we have a baby

10:09.792 --> 10:12.250
- and I see my little.
- Three-year old daughter or son,

10:12.292 --> 10:13.375
And she's gonna sit there

10:13.417 --> 10:14.750
- and ridicule and ridicule.
- Oh, please.

10:14.792 --> 10:15.959
That's not gonna happen.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.124
That's never gonna happen.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.291
In many ways,

10:18.292 --> 10:20.417
I understand I'm not meant

10:20.458 --> 10:22.624
to be with another person.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.958
I should be on my own,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.457
un-encumbering anyone else

10:27.458 --> 10:28.917
because vida has paved

10:28.918 --> 10:30.375
the road for me.

10:30.417 --> 10:32.832
Like, this is my fate.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.250
I'm not having an easy time

10:34.292 --> 10:36.333
- talking about it right now.
- Okay.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.458
Something is scaring me.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.667
And that would be?

10:39.708 --> 10:40.792
Shadow.

10:40.833 --> 10:41.875
Her fear of being

10:41.876 --> 10:42.917
like her mom.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.625
I just hope

10:45.626 --> 10:47.125
that I haven't gone so far

10:47.167 --> 10:48.917
that I've led him to believe

10:48.958 --> 10:50.125
that I'm hard to live with.

10:50.167 --> 10:51.417
I mean, at the end of the day,

10:51.458 --> 10:52.832
I just want this to be a fight,

10:52.833 --> 10:54.417
not the end.

10:54.458 --> 10:55.667
- Thank you very much.
- Alright,

10:55.670 --> 10:56.709
I will... I'll see you

10:56.710 --> 10:57.750
next session.

10:57.792 --> 10:59.042
Let's go, kiddo.

11:01.042 --> 11:02.125
Coming up...

11:02.167 --> 11:03.958
- I did things wrong.
- What?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.042
You just won't let go

11:05.043 --> 11:06.083
of this anger.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.083
- Because you haven't.
- Admitted anything.

11:18.708 --> 11:20.208
- We'll lay it out,
- just so we can do this.

11:20.211 --> 11:21.375
- While we're talking.
- Okay.

11:21.417 --> 11:22.480
The two of us can like,

11:22.481 --> 11:23.541
finalize the seat...

11:23.542 --> 11:24.875
Right. The seating chart.

11:24.876 --> 11:26.207
Is really important.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.375
- We have to figure out.
- How many chairs.

11:27.378 --> 11:29.125
- We're gonna have out there.
- Absolutely.

11:29.167 --> 11:31.047
- I'm going crazy.
- And I'm super stressed out.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.541
Because we have a fashion show

11:32.542 --> 11:34.542
that has 40 million moving parts

11:34.583 --> 11:36.708
and I'm the conductor of it all.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.229
So, it'll be a cluster five.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.707
Okay.

11:39.708 --> 11:40.833
And so, it'll be Reza, Mike,

11:40.875 --> 11:42.208
Jessica, mj.

11:42.250 --> 11:43.542
So, let's cluster them together.

11:43.583 --> 11:44.707
Okay, perfect.

11:44.708 --> 11:45.792
Do you want me to wear

11:45.793 --> 11:46.875
a one-piece or...?

11:46.917 --> 11:48.208
- I think a bikini.
- Would be better.

11:48.211 --> 11:49.625
And you have a gorgeous body.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.000
Let's see you, baby.

11:51.042 --> 11:52.208
You guys, I'm sorry.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.979
Hello, hello.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.708
Oh hey.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.249
That's gorgeous on you.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.917
- See, on her boobs, it's perfect.
- Yeah, definitely.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.333
- This would not be cute.
- On somebody.

12:00.375 --> 12:01.416
With like, huge, yeah.

12:01.417 --> 12:02.500
Alright, let's see

12:02.501 --> 12:03.582
you walk, honey.

12:03.583 --> 12:04.750
Romantica. Woo.

12:04.751 --> 12:05.916
Beautiful.

12:05.917 --> 12:07.082
Yeah, baby.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.667
- Woo.
- Yes, love it.

12:08.708 --> 12:10.250
Look at the back flowing.

12:10.292 --> 12:11.749
Mashti and arta,

12:11.750 --> 12:13.750
- you guys can come as guests.
- You don't have to come early,

12:13.753 --> 12:15.583
- Just come and enjoy.
- Yourselves tomorrow.

12:15.586 --> 12:17.417
- Love you guys.
- Bye.

12:17.420 --> 12:19.000
See you tomorrow.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.167
So, we're done with these?

12:20.208 --> 12:22.249
I'm extremely nervous.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.708
I invited all these vips

12:23.750 --> 12:24.875
and special people

12:24.917 --> 12:26.667
and what if they hate the stuff?

12:26.708 --> 12:28.021
There should be 90 seats.

12:28.022 --> 12:29.333
Okay.

12:29.375 --> 12:30.646
I think we're planning to do

12:30.647 --> 12:31.917
a 100 gift bags.

12:31.958 --> 12:33.833
- But I feel like we should do,
- like, for the models.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.250
- And stuff too.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

12:35.253 --> 12:36.438
You do your thing,

12:36.439 --> 12:37.624
I'm gonna call mj real quick.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.104
Tell mj bring the toya

12:39.105 --> 12:40.583
with her.

12:42.958 --> 12:44.083
Hello?

12:44.125 --> 12:45.291
Hey, booby.

12:45.292 --> 12:46.791
How you feeling today, girl?

12:46.792 --> 12:48.292
Oh, I don't feel that good.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.125
- Like, I have to finalize.
- The seating thing.

12:50.128 --> 12:51.250
Which brings me...

12:51.251 --> 12:52.375
I was... i thought...

12:52.417 --> 12:54.417
- I'm not sure, is Tommy working.
- Or is he coming?

12:54.458 --> 12:55.500
I wanna just make sure

12:55.501 --> 12:56.542
we get that.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.542
- He's not gonna be able.
- To make it.

12:58.583 --> 12:59.624
Okay, that's what I thought

12:59.625 --> 13:00.791
but I wanted to make sure

13:00.792 --> 13:01.834
and he's always invited

13:01.835 --> 13:02.875
of course, you know?

13:02.917 --> 13:04.208
- Well, I mean,
- I appreciate that.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.354
But right now,

13:05.355 --> 13:06.457
I have bigger fish to fry.

13:06.458 --> 13:08.292
Like, our relationship is not...

13:08.333 --> 13:09.625
- What's...
- at all where

13:09.628 --> 13:10.917
I would've thought it was.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.250
Really? What's going on?

13:13.292 --> 13:15.125
- It's hard and like, now.
- That we're living together

13:15.128 --> 13:17.791
I see that we may not

13:17.792 --> 13:19.832
be compatible, babe.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.250
What?

13:21.292 --> 13:22.332
I don't know if, you know,

13:22.333 --> 13:23.666
he's gonna stay here.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.458
- Well...
- Honestly, I'm thinking

13:25.500 --> 13:27.125
I might dip out

13:27.167 --> 13:29.332
and stay somewhere else.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.499
What?

13:30.500 --> 13:32.666
Babe, this is... i don't,

13:32.667 --> 13:33.958
- I can't believe.
- You're telling me.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.500
- All this stuff.
- I had no idea.

13:35.542 --> 13:36.792
I didn't either.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.750
- You know, like, okay,
- we have an issue.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.500
- Let's talk about it,
- let's work through it.

13:40.542 --> 13:41.999
I thought we were building.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.332
I know it sounds weird

13:43.333 --> 13:44.625
but Tommy's good for her

13:44.667 --> 13:45.980
because I feel like

13:45.981 --> 13:47.292
he doesn't take her sh...

13:47.333 --> 13:48.646
Because once that vida thing

13:48.647 --> 13:49.958
comes in,

13:51.500 --> 13:53.332

20:27.647 --> 20:29.042
big or like, flat.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.583
The stakes for this fashion show

are monumental.

20:52.086 --> 20:53.208
- Yeah, but I love.
- The gold underneath.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.250
The purpose of doing

20:54.251 --> 20:55.250
this fashion show

20:55.251 --> 20:56.917
is to get press, basically.

20:56.958 --> 20:58.291

20:58.292 --> 20:59.583
is falling that much.

21:04.792 --> 21:06.458
- or instagram it,
- snapchat it.

21:06.500 --> 21:07.750
And then, hopefully,

21:07.792 --> 21:09.624
they'll be completely wowed

21:09.625 --> 21:11.458
- by the show.
- Let me run.

21:11.461 --> 21:12.625
And then maybe you and I do

- another run outside.
- Okay, yeah.

21:13.833 --> 21:16.208
Ooh, it's so pretty.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.417
I have a concern.

21:17.458 --> 21:19.125
- That shouldn't be there.
- Yeah, over to the side.

21:19.167 --> 21:20.583
- I think it's okay...
- Yeah,

21:20.625 --> 21:21.625
But I don't want it here.

Where are the flowers?

21:25.625 --> 21:27.042
Yeah, so they changed that.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.957
So, then I need to fix it.

- shouldn't they space.
- The tables...

- Well, we're gonna have.
- The auction table here.

21:32.628 --> 21:33.792
Oh, that's why, okay good.

You're gonna add

21:34.959 --> 21:36.083
like, long-ness to the side?

21:36.125 --> 21:37.917

- very prestigious.

- On time,

21:44.503 --> 21:46.333

22:26.211 --> 22:27.417
A few days now,

22:27.418 --> 22:28.625
about Tommy's breakup.

22:28.667 --> 22:29.708
- He came to his senses.
- Wait, merce,

22:29.711 --> 22:32.542
You cannot do this sh... to me.

22:32.583 --> 22:34.167
- I...

22:34.208 --> 22:35.375

22:35.378 --> 22:36.667
"I told you so, I told you so,

22:36.708 --> 22:38.125
I told you so, I told you so."

22:38.167 --> 22:41.374
Merce, you cannot choose

22:41.375 --> 22:43.042
or not choose a mate

22:43.083 --> 22:44.625
because you're worried

22:44.667 --> 22:46.041
what your mom...

22:46.042 --> 22:47.292
I'm saying like,

22:47.333 --> 22:48.707
I'm gonna hear it.

22:48.708 --> 22:50.000
To say that vida

22:50.001 --> 22:51.292
doesn't approve

22:51.333 --> 22:52.667
of Tommy and mj

22:52.668 --> 22:54.000
is the understatement

22:54.042 --> 22:55.375
of the century.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.333
- I wish she would keep.
- Her mouth shut.

22:57.375 --> 22:58.771
And allow for mj

22:58.772 --> 23:00.167
to figure it out.

23:00.208 --> 23:01.333
- Are we looking.
- For our names too?

23:01.375 --> 23:03.250
- Yeah, we're here.
- There we go.

23:03.292 --> 23:05.375
Oh, okay.

23:05.417 --> 23:06.584
Yeah. You guys, everybody

23:06.585 --> 23:07.750
who's got legs out,

23:07.792 --> 23:09.750
- they need to be bronzed.
- And oiled.

23:09.753 --> 23:11.749
Get the back of her legs too.

23:11.750 --> 23:13.208
Everybody who has slick hair,

23:13.250 --> 23:15.167
- we need to put more oil.
- In the sides,

23:15.208 --> 23:17.082
It looks dry.

23:17.083 --> 23:18.083
There's a little thread

23:18.084 --> 23:19.083
on this one,

23:19.084 --> 23:20.375
do you have a scissors?

23:20.417 --> 23:21.833
Mommy, you look gorgeous.

23:21.875 --> 23:23.042
Let's do a touch-up

23:23.043 --> 23:24.208
on your hair, too.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.750
What shoes do you guys have?

23:25.792 --> 23:26.917
- I have the Jims.
- Oh my god,

23:26.920 --> 23:28.333
I am going crazy now.

23:30.083 --> 23:32.416
What's up?

23:32.417 --> 23:33.875
- That's...
- This is funny though.

23:33.917 --> 23:35.042
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.500
I like your sunglasses.

23:36.542 --> 23:37.582
I like your hat.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.583
So, I'm glad we're all here,

23:38.625 --> 23:39.958
let's go to the bar.

23:41.125 --> 23:42.916
Salamati, everybody please.

23:42.917 --> 23:44.625
- Alright, alright.
- Can we talk about something?

23:44.667 --> 23:45.959
Mike and I were getting

23:45.960 --> 23:47.250
manicures the other day

23:47.292 --> 23:48.625
and we were chatting

23:48.626 --> 23:49.957
about golnesa.

23:49.958 --> 23:50.958
I'm getting sick

23:50.959 --> 23:51.959
of her nonsense.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.146
Golnesa's been

23:53.147 --> 23:54.291
on the campaign trail.

23:54.292 --> 23:55.459
This bitch

23:55.460 --> 23:56.624
is all over social media,

23:56.625 --> 23:58.292
talking about her heart,

23:58.333 --> 23:59.979
chemotherapy,

23:59.980 --> 24:01.624
not being able to have kids.

24:01.625 --> 24:03.292
[Speaking farsi]

24:03.333 --> 24:04.396
But her lifestyle

24:04.397 --> 24:05.457
hasn't changed at all,

24:05.458 --> 24:06.875
so that's

24:06.876 --> 24:08.292
where I'm having trouble

24:08.333 --> 24:10.125
making sense of everything.

24:10.167 --> 24:12.417
- Merce, this is one thing.
- That's permeating in my mind,

24:12.458 --> 24:13.792
Like, really bothering me.

24:13.833 --> 24:16.124
We took golnesa camping

24:16.125 --> 24:17.624
for an intervention

24:17.625 --> 24:19.291
because her behavior

24:19.292 --> 24:20.957
has been out of control.

24:20.958 --> 24:22.625
She has not done anything

24:22.626 --> 24:24.292
to improve

24:24.333 --> 24:26.458
since the camping trip.

24:31.167 --> 24:32.332
Kim is not coming,

24:32.333 --> 24:34.167
- so we have to put somebody.
- In the front.

24:34.170 --> 24:35.500
It's really stressful.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.917
So, who are we gonna put there?

24:36.958 --> 24:38.250
Oh, that's a lot of food.

24:38.292 --> 24:39.958
Hi, arta.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.125
- Love you.
- You too.

24:41.167 --> 24:42.417
How are you?

24:42.458 --> 24:43.833
[Speaking farsi]

24:43.875 --> 24:45.332
We can just... you guys,

24:45.333 --> 24:47.167
- who's hungry?
- Anybody wanna eat some food?

24:47.208 --> 24:49.167
- I'm going crazy.
- And I'm super stressed out,

24:49.208 --> 24:51.333
- But the fact.
- That I can rely on my family.

24:51.336 --> 24:52.458
The way that I can

24:52.459 --> 24:53.583
is so precious.

24:53.625 --> 24:54.666
I know I need them.

24:54.667 --> 24:55.999
[Speaking farsi]

24:56.000 --> 24:57.667
You guys are guests.

24:57.668 --> 24:59.332
Go have a drink.

24:59.333 --> 25:00.583
Amelia, this is too clashy

25:00.584 --> 25:01.832
with this.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.625
- Oh.
- Yeah, that's much better.

25:03.667 --> 25:04.667
- Because it'll blend in.
- Okay.

25:04.708 --> 25:06.292
- So, literally,
- once we're ready to go,

25:06.333 --> 25:08.375
- I want all of us to be stationed.
- In that room.

25:08.417 --> 25:10.167
- Okay.
- So, whatever you need,

25:10.208 --> 25:11.271
Bring it.

25:11.272 --> 25:12.333
And I need to talk to you.

25:17.042 --> 25:19.042
- It's kind of scary though,
- how she can turn it on and off.

25:19.045 --> 25:20.542
- Well, no,
- I feel a little dirty.

25:20.545 --> 25:21.625
For even bringing it up

25:21.667 --> 25:23.000
- because I don't wanna.
- Create problems.

25:23.042 --> 25:24.958
Where no problems exist.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.188
That's so amazing.

25:26.189 --> 25:27.374
Where?

25:27.375 --> 25:28.708
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:28.711 --> 25:29.958
How's it going?

25:29.959 --> 25:31.207
What's up?

25:31.208 --> 25:32.333
How are you?

25:32.375 --> 25:34.208
- My first thought.
- Seeing gg roll up.

25:34.211 --> 25:35.500
At the kaftan show

25:35.542 --> 25:36.542
is that she doesn't

25:36.543 --> 25:37.543
look like someone

25:37.583 --> 25:39.125
who's about to get chemo.

25:39.167 --> 25:41.207
No one can confirm anything.

25:41.208 --> 25:42.374
At this point,

25:42.375 --> 25:44.104
I doubt her chemo story

25:44.105 --> 25:45.833
more than ever.

25:45.875 --> 25:47.458
We're concerned about you,

25:47.500 --> 25:49.207
we wanna know what's going on.

25:49.208 --> 25:50.229
With what?

25:50.230 --> 25:51.250
With you, your health.

25:51.292 --> 25:52.582
What's the news?

25:52.583 --> 25:54.208
I just got the news yesterday,

25:54.250 --> 25:55.916
they say it's very aggressive

25:55.917 --> 25:56.980
and you have to do

25:56.981 --> 25:58.042
the intravenous chemo.

25:58.083 --> 25:59.708
Two hours, once a month,

25:59.750 --> 26:01.334
I sit in a chair

26:01.335 --> 26:02.916
and I get it in my veins.

26:02.917 --> 26:04.333
Two hours, once a month?

26:04.375 --> 26:06.417
- Yes.
- We wanna be more involved,

26:06.420 --> 26:07.917
- We wanna be supportive.
- And we wanna know.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.542
- What's going on.
- Yeah but mj,

26:09.583 --> 26:10.750
Just honestly, like,

26:10.792 --> 26:12.583
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Right now.

26:12.586 --> 26:14.249
People hear the word "chemo"

26:14.250 --> 26:15.250
then they freak out.

26:15.292 --> 26:16.667
So, all these people are here

26:16.708 --> 26:17.916
to make sure everything's okay

26:17.917 --> 26:19.396
and I'm okay and people

26:19.397 --> 26:20.875
should just back off.

26:20.917 --> 26:22.063
It's my life,

26:22.064 --> 26:23.208
it's my f... ing business.

26:23.250 --> 26:25.249
Do they have beer?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.625
They might,

26:26.626 --> 26:28.000
do you want me to go check?

26:28.042 --> 26:31.124
I think that golnesa is lying

26:31.125 --> 26:33.417
about having ra.

26:33.458 --> 26:34.875
I don't know

26:34.876 --> 26:36.291
if she has ra or not.

26:36.292 --> 26:37.771
I think that

26:37.772 --> 26:39.250
if she does have it,

26:39.292 --> 26:40.583
she's exaggerating.

26:40.625 --> 26:41.792
But for all I know,

26:41.793 --> 26:42.958
she's lying.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.458
- Why would somebody.
- Do something like that?

26:44.461 --> 26:46.457
Because they want attention.

26:46.458 --> 26:47.625
This bitch wears like,

26:47.626 --> 26:48.791
stilettos like this,

26:48.792 --> 26:50.292
she drops it like it's hot.

26:50.333 --> 26:52.083
She drinks and chain smokes

26:52.125 --> 26:53.209
and parties

26:53.210 --> 26:54.292
like there's no tomorrow,

26:54.333 --> 26:55.479
yet she's gonna start

26:55.480 --> 26:56.625
chemotherapy.

26:56.667 --> 26:57.813
Why hasn't she changed

26:57.814 --> 26:58.958
her lifestyle?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.792
- Reza brings up.
- Some really good points.

27:00.795 --> 27:02.355
People with ra

27:02.356 --> 27:03.917
don't wear six-inch heels

27:03.958 --> 27:05.918
- and go to the club.
- Until 4:00 in the morning.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.124
Maybe she's exaggerating a bit.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.792
- No, no, no, no.
- She's a sick...

27:08.795 --> 27:10.625
- You don't exaggerate.
- About chemotherapy.

27:10.628 --> 27:11.979
So what are we gonna do?

27:11.980 --> 27:13.332
Are we gonna all shut up again

27:13.333 --> 27:15.667
and let this pass?

27:15.708 --> 27:16.999
Can you please ask her

27:17.000 --> 27:18.500
if she had chemotherapy or not?

27:18.542 --> 27:21.083
Can you ask her?

27:21.125 --> 27:22.625
Ask her,

27:22.667 --> 27:24.292
ask her right now.

27:28.458 --> 27:30.292
- Coming up...
- Right now, there's a problem.

27:30.333 --> 27:31.563
There's a question of,

27:31.564 --> 27:32.792
maybe she doesn't have ra.

27:32.833 --> 27:33.917
Shervin, do you know what,

27:33.958 --> 27:35.625
shut the f... up.

27:45.667 --> 27:47.000
So what are we gonna do?

27:47.001 --> 27:48.332
Are we gonna all shut up again

27:48.333 --> 27:49.832
and let this pass?

27:49.833 --> 27:51.000
Can you please ask her

27:51.042 --> 27:52.667
if she had chemotherapy or not?

27:52.708 --> 27:54.917
Can you ask her?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.625
Ask her,

27:56.667 --> 27:58.375
ask her right now.

28:00.875 --> 28:01.875
Being treated

28:01.876 --> 28:02.875
for chemotherapy,

28:02.876 --> 28:04.542
- you can't just throw that word.
- Around like that.

28:04.545 --> 28:06.375
That's a serious treatment.

28:06.417 --> 28:07.480
We've all had some kind of

28:07.481 --> 28:08.541
experience in our life

28:08.542 --> 28:10.458
- with cancer.
- And it's not fun to sit down.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.167
And see somebody take chemo.

28:12.208 --> 28:13.271
For it to be used lightly

28:13.272 --> 28:14.333
or thrown around

28:14.375 --> 28:16.292
in exaggeration

28:16.293 --> 28:18.207
is almost offensive.

28:18.208 --> 28:19.542
- Golnesa, I know you don't.
- Wanna talk to me.

28:19.545 --> 28:20.875
- But I have to tell you this,
- because you've always.

28:20.878 --> 28:22.542
- Had my back and you've always.
- Been loyal to me.

28:22.545 --> 28:24.625
Right now, there's a problem.

28:24.667 --> 28:25.896
There's... I'm literally

28:25.897 --> 28:27.125
being told

28:27.167 --> 28:28.207
that there's a question of like,

28:28.208 --> 28:30.500
hey, maybe she doesn't have ra.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.750
I'm like, what?

28:31.751 --> 28:32.958
That doesn't make sense.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.042
