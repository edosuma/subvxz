00:28.611 --> 00:31.445
(clanking)

00:32.865 --> 00:34.748
This is Bishop.

00:34.750 --> 00:35.949
I've tracked the final suspect.

00:35.951 --> 00:38.535
Compartment two
tack eight-four tack two.

00:47.096 --> 00:49.463
NCIS! Hands in the air!

00:49.465 --> 00:52.850
I said, “Hands in the air!”

00:52.852 --> 00:54.935
(grunting)

01:02.395 --> 01:03.644
You're dead, Bishop.

01:03.646 --> 01:06.146
I know.

01:06.148 --> 01:08.532
You have pointy elbows.

01:08.534 --> 01:09.983
BISHOP:
I failed.

01:09.985 --> 01:11.285
TONY:
Not exactly.

01:11.287 --> 01:12.486
MAN (over speaker):
Attention, all trainees,

01:12.488 --> 01:13.987
report to the command room
for debriefing.

01:13.989 --> 01:15.205
You heard Gibbs.
I-I died.

01:15.207 --> 01:16.657
There's no coming
back from that.

01:16.659 --> 01:19.426
You are aware that
you didn't actually die

01:19.428 --> 01:21.545
and this is just a
training exercise?

01:21.547 --> 01:23.080
He won't even look at me.

01:23.082 --> 01:24.498
It's a silent form
of encouragement.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.917
BORIN: DiNozzo.
Ah.

01:26.919 --> 01:28.168
If it isn't
the Julie McCoy

01:28.170 --> 01:30.504
of our little
training exercise.

01:30.506 --> 01:32.389
Heard you were knocking boots
with Leia Pendergast.

01:32.391 --> 01:33.424
TONY:
From who?

01:33.426 --> 01:35.426
From Leia. We SoulCycle.

01:36.512 --> 01:38.011
It's a form of exercise,
DiNozzo.

01:38.013 --> 01:40.097
I know.

01:40.099 --> 01:41.348
Well, Leia's fun,

01:41.350 --> 01:42.683
but it just sort of
didn't work out.

01:42.685 --> 01:44.685
Sort of a dalliance.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.153
Calm down, DiNozzo.
I'm not your conscience.

01:46.155 --> 01:48.188
Dally who you want.
(laughs)

01:48.190 --> 01:49.406
Bishop,

01:49.408 --> 01:51.859
this is CGIS Special
Agent Abigail Borin.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.411
She's into cardio and
interagency gossip.

01:54.413 --> 01:55.779
Borin, this is...

01:55.781 --> 01:56.997
Ellie Bishop.

01:56.999 --> 01:58.449
I observed
your exercise.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.284
It was passable
work for a probie.

02:00.286 --> 02:03.370
Mmm. See? You didn't fail.
You passed.

02:04.206 --> 02:05.789
I-I need
to go again.

02:05.791 --> 02:08.709
There are no do-overs
in training.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.127
But hang in there.

02:10.128 --> 02:12.179
You're doing fine.

02:14.683 --> 02:16.049
I don't get it.

02:16.051 --> 02:17.768
I-I mean,
I did everything right.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.970
I-I followed procedure
to the letter.

02:19.972 --> 02:22.055
I could've sworn there was
only one suspect left.

02:22.057 --> 02:24.441
Bishop.

02:24.443 --> 02:26.560
It's not always
about procedure.

02:26.562 --> 02:28.145
It's about this...

02:28.147 --> 02:29.480
and this...

02:29.482 --> 02:30.731
and these.

02:30.733 --> 02:33.066
360-degree awareness.

02:33.068 --> 02:34.902
Comes with experience.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.987
Right, Borin?

02:36.989 --> 02:39.239
Borin?

02:43.212 --> 02:44.711
Gibbs, what do you see?

02:44.713 --> 02:46.213
I don't know. There's
something out there.

02:46.215 --> 02:48.715
At your two o'clock.

02:51.053 --> 02:52.970
Man overboard!
Man overboard!

No bloating.
Yeah. Which means what?

He hasn't been floating

Yeah, and...?

BISHOP:
He's got a gash on his forehead

03:55.664 --> 03:57.164

03:57.166 --> 03:58.365
He was in a fight.

off the side of a ship.
Could be an accident.

04:08.093 --> 04:09.793
BORIN: <i>San Dominick</i>
is a cargo ship

04:09.795 --> 04:11.628
that left port in Norfolk
three hours ago.

04:11.630 --> 04:13.013
Anybody notice
they're one man short?

04:13.015 --> 04:14.464
Well, it's hard to say.

04:14.466 --> 04:16.216
They're not responding
to any of our calls.

04:16.218 --> 04:17.968
Complete radio silence.

04:17.970 --> 04:19.886
That's not the only thing.
Look at this.

04:19.887 --> 04:21.605
The <i> San Dominick</i>
is supposed to be

04:21.607 --> 04:23.473
heading to the Port
of Bilbao, Spain.

04:23.475 --> 04:24.307
They're off course.

04:24.309 --> 04:26.142
Heading south.

04:26.144 --> 04:27.644
The <i> San Dominick</i>
is American owned,

04:27.646 --> 04:29.729
but Panamanian flagged.
Both our jurisdictions.

04:29.731 --> 04:31.147
No Coast Guard patrols
in the area.

04:31.149 --> 04:32.365
We're the closest vessel.

04:32.367 --> 04:34.000
How far?
60 nautical miles.

04:34.002 --> 04:35.485
We can be there
in a couple hours.

04:35.487 --> 04:37.571
Bishop...

04:37.573 --> 04:39.189
pack your bag.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.541
You're escorting the body
back to NCIS.

04:42.461 --> 04:44.377
We're going
after the <i> San Dominick.</i>

05:00.881 --> 05:03.699
Ah, the trainee returns.
How'd it go?

05:04.301 --> 05:05.350
(sighs)

05:05.352 --> 05:06.768
I don't want to talk about it.

05:06.770 --> 05:09.354
That good, huh?
I just spent the last

05:09.356 --> 05:12.073
hour on the choppiest
helo ride of my life,

05:12.075 --> 05:13.992
clutching a dead body
so it didn't shift

05:13.994 --> 05:16.578
because the tie-down
rings were loose.

05:16.580 --> 05:17.939
It was the high
point of my morning.

05:17.963 --> 05:18.915
Mmm.

05:18.916 --> 05:20.282
You run background
on our victim?

05:20.284 --> 05:22.951
Yeah. The company that
owns the <i> San Dominick--</i>

05:22.953 --> 05:26.705
Stalten Shipping-- sent me
Joe Willis's employee records.

05:26.707 --> 05:28.873
40 years old.
From Dover, Delaware.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.458
Lives in Norfolk.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.928
Served 15 years in the Navy.
He's ready reserve.

05:32.930 --> 05:35.430
Yeah. Hired
as security last month

05:35.432 --> 05:37.549
for Stalten's
transatlantic runs.

05:37.551 --> 05:40.302
Why does a cargo ship
need an armed guard?

05:40.304 --> 05:42.103
Piracy, terrorism.

05:42.105 --> 05:45.190
Shipping companies
like to be prepared.

05:45.192 --> 05:46.858
Well, Ducky's
starting his autopsy,

05:46.860 --> 05:48.727
so we'll know
if it was murder soon.

05:50.113 --> 05:52.147
Do you want to talk
about that test now?

05:52.149 --> 05:53.481
No.

05:53.483 --> 05:56.484
Okay.

05:57.988 --> 05:59.487
It's just...

05:59.489 --> 06:01.489
I did everything right.

06:01.491 --> 06:02.991
I mean, I was textbook.

06:02.993 --> 06:04.492
How could I fail?

06:04.494 --> 06:06.745
Everybody fails.
It's the Kobayashi Maru.

06:06.747 --> 06:08.330
The Kobayashi Ma-what?

06:08.332 --> 06:10.298
The Kobayashi Maru.
It's from <i> The Wrath of Khan.</i>

06:10.300 --> 06:12.751
<i>Star Wars</i> again?
<i>Star Trek.</i>

06:12.753 --> 06:14.669
Same difference.
(scoffs) No, no, no.

06:14.671 --> 06:17.889
No. See,<i> Star Wars</i>
is grounded in mythology.

06:17.891 --> 06:19.341
<i>Star Trek</i>
is grounded in science...

06:19.343 --> 06:21.059
Tim. Focus.

06:21.061 --> 06:23.511
Right. Kobayashi Maru

06:23.513 --> 06:25.513
was a training exercise
on the <i> Enterprise.</i>

06:25.515 --> 06:28.266
It's a lose-lose scenario.
No matter what choice you make,

06:28.268 --> 06:29.517
you're not gonna win.

06:29.519 --> 06:30.852
Th-That's cheating.

06:30.854 --> 06:31.903
It's supposed
to build character.

06:31.905 --> 06:33.521
By cheating?
Look, Bishop,

06:33.523 --> 06:35.357
all I'm saying is you
shouldn't feel bad

06:35.359 --> 06:37.692
about this, okay? Nobody
passes this training exercise.

06:37.694 --> 06:40.445
Not me. Not Tony.
Not Captain Kirk.

06:40.447 --> 06:41.529
Well, technically, Kirk...

06:41.531 --> 06:42.814
What about Gibbs?
Gibbs?

06:42.816 --> 06:44.833
Oh, he passed.
How?

06:44.835 --> 06:46.117
He's Gibbs.

06:46.119 --> 06:48.370
Yeah.

06:48.372 --> 06:50.455
WOMAN (over radio):
Boarding party to USS <i> Serano.</i>

06:50.457 --> 06:52.424
we are on board
the <i> San Dominick.</i> Over.

06:52.426 --> 06:53.958
MAN (over radio):
Boarding party, roger.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.677
We'll await your sitrep.

06:55.679 --> 06:58.430
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

06:58.432 --> 06:59.547
This is Special Agent Borin,

06:59.549 --> 07:02.267
CGIS.
We speeding, Officer?

07:02.269 --> 07:04.602
(soft laugh)
Sorry.

07:04.604 --> 07:05.970
Bad joke. It's not every day

07:05.972 --> 07:07.722
you're pulled over
by a Navy cruiser.

07:07.724 --> 07:09.057
Where's the captain?

07:09.059 --> 07:10.108
Below deck.

07:10.110 --> 07:11.559
I'm James Meyer,
first mate.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.311
What can I do you for?
Get the captain.

07:13.313 --> 07:15.613
He's a little busy
captaining right now,

07:15.615 --> 07:17.399
but he'll be up soon.

07:17.401 --> 07:20.035
Maybe I can help.
You aware you're off course?

07:20.037 --> 07:21.403
Sure.

07:21.405 --> 07:24.072
There's, uh,
inclement weather ahead.

07:24.074 --> 07:25.907
We're just
trying to avoid it.

07:25.909 --> 07:28.159
Yeah, well you're not
answering your radio, either.

07:28.161 --> 07:30.245
Yeah, comm's on the fritz.

07:30.247 --> 07:32.747
That's what the captain's
working on right now.

07:32.749 --> 07:34.582
And all crew is accounted for?

07:34.584 --> 07:35.750
Yeah.

07:37.304 --> 07:38.920
MEYER:
I'm sorry, I feel like we're

07:38.922 --> 07:40.422
not on
the same page.

07:40.424 --> 07:41.973
What's this about?

07:41.975 --> 07:44.175
Joe Willis.
Your security officer.

07:44.177 --> 07:46.227
He in some kind of trouble?

07:46.229 --> 07:48.346
Well, yeah,
you could say that.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.015
Holy crap.

07:51.017 --> 07:52.267
Same page now?

07:54.321 --> 07:56.771
I knew it. I'm cursed.

07:56.773 --> 07:58.773
First the radio,
then the weather,

07:58.775 --> 08:00.442
now this...
terrible accident.

08:00.444 --> 08:02.444
Can you tell us
where Joe Willis

08:02.446 --> 08:04.829
was supposed to be, Captain?
Doing his rounds.

08:04.831 --> 08:07.532
Security check, I guess.
Must have slipped off deck.

08:07.534 --> 08:08.583
Did he?

08:08.585 --> 08:09.918
What are you thinking?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.870
Don't know. Body's
being examined.

08:11.872 --> 08:13.366
We need a manifest
and a crew list.

08:13.390 --> 08:14.507
Why?

08:14.508 --> 08:16.154
'Cause we're gonna
question them.

08:16.178 --> 08:17.426
Now?

08:17.427 --> 08:19.427
What is it with the people
on this ship?

08:19.429 --> 08:21.963
Yes, now. A man is dead.

08:21.965 --> 08:24.599
By accident. Now, look,
I appreciate your position,

08:24.601 --> 08:26.134
but you need to
appreciate mine.

08:26.136 --> 08:27.886
I'm-I'm three hours
off schedule.

08:27.888 --> 08:29.471
Gee, that's...
that's rough.

08:29.473 --> 08:31.773
I... I get it.

08:31.775 --> 08:34.808
I get it.
You're investigating a crime.

08:34.811 --> 08:36.977
But from my
perspective,

08:36.980 --> 08:39.397
we're just all trying
to make a living here.

08:39.399 --> 08:40.732
Now, can't we
handle this

08:40.734 --> 08:42.033
after we've
finished our run?

08:42.034 --> 08:43.368
No.

08:45.405 --> 08:48.540
I'm telling you,
as captain of this ship,

08:48.542 --> 08:50.992
there is absolutely
nothing illegal

08:50.994 --> 08:53.828
or suspicious...

08:54.664 --> 08:55.964
Captain, you o... you okay?

08:55.966 --> 08:59.384
Just need to sit.
(breathing heavily)

09:03.723 --> 09:05.340
You've been stabbed.

09:05.342 --> 09:07.142
I need to get you
back to our ship, Captain.

09:07.144 --> 09:10.428
DUCKY:
<i>Our victim was in a fight.</i>

09:10.430 --> 09:12.347
Note the defensive wounds.

09:12.349 --> 09:15.266
Probably caused by
a knife and received

09:15.268 --> 09:19.187
while fending off what could
have been a violent attack.

09:19.189 --> 09:20.238
Was he stabbed?

09:20.240 --> 09:21.606
No. No, no.

09:21.608 --> 09:22.774
The ship's doctor
was correct

09:22.776 --> 09:23.908
in the manner
of death.

09:23.910 --> 09:25.410
This man drowned.

09:25.412 --> 09:27.779
However,
the water in his lungs

09:27.781 --> 09:29.581
was not seawater.

09:29.583 --> 09:31.699
I'm waiting for
a confirmation from Abby,

09:31.701 --> 09:34.586
but my guess is that
it was potable water,

09:34.588 --> 09:36.871
for use aboard
the <i> San Dominick.</i>

09:36.873 --> 09:38.756
Confirms Joe Willis
was murdered.

09:38.758 --> 09:41.042
That I cannot say.

09:41.044 --> 09:44.012
You just told me Joe Willis
drowned on the <i> San Dominick.</i>

09:44.014 --> 09:45.547
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

09:45.549 --> 09:48.683
I said this man drowned
on the <i> San Dominick.</i>

09:48.685 --> 09:50.718
But this man is not Joe Willis.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.971
According to
his records,

09:52.973 --> 09:56.140
Joe Willis served for
15 years in the Navy.

09:56.142 --> 09:58.443
That's right.
The autopsy showed

09:58.445 --> 10:02.113
that this man suffered
from renal agenesis.

10:02.115 --> 10:04.649
It's a birth defect that
has no discernible effects

10:04.651 --> 10:06.784
on living a normal,
healthy life,

10:06.786 --> 10:08.536
with the possible
exception of passing

10:08.538 --> 10:12.740
the medical examination to
serve in the armed forces.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.743
Since there's no waiver for
enlistees with only one kidney.

10:15.745 --> 10:19.247
If this isn't Joe Willis,
then who is he?

10:19.249 --> 10:22.083
Ah...

10:22.085 --> 10:23.801
Skipper gonna be okay?

10:23.803 --> 10:25.503
Special Agent Borin
is escorting him

10:25.505 --> 10:26.838
to our ship's corpsman.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.424
I can't believe
this is happening.

10:29.426 --> 10:31.726
Captain O'Rourke
and Joe Willis--

10:31.728 --> 10:33.011
they have any problems?

10:33.013 --> 10:34.312
Skipper doesn't
have problems.

10:34.314 --> 10:35.763
Everyone loves him.

10:38.568 --> 10:40.184
MEYER:
Oh, my God.

10:40.186 --> 10:42.437
Not everybody.

10:42.439 --> 10:44.072
Holy crap.

10:44.858 --> 10:47.025
What the hell
happened in here?

11:05.795 --> 11:06.961
Excuse me.

11:17.190 --> 11:18.806
You and me need to talk.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.142
Alone.

11:21.144 --> 11:22.477
Hey.

11:22.479 --> 11:24.162
It's not a request.

11:25.699 --> 11:27.615
Petty Officer, remove this
man from the radio room.

11:27.617 --> 11:28.816
Yes, sir.

11:39.245 --> 11:41.296
This radio has been sabotaged.

11:41.298 --> 11:42.714
Holy...
Stop.

11:42.716 --> 11:44.832
I have no...
Don't.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.971
Busted radio,
dead security officer,

11:49.973 --> 11:51.973
wounded captain and him.

11:51.975 --> 11:53.925
Renaldo? He's...

11:53.927 --> 11:56.427
He's wearing canvas shoes,
not steel-toed boots.

11:56.429 --> 11:58.513
Who is he?

11:58.515 --> 12:00.648
Because he is not part
of your crew.

12:02.352 --> 12:05.186
Captain's stable,
but he lost a lot of blood.

12:05.188 --> 12:06.938
Knife nicked an artery.

12:06.940 --> 12:09.023
Security officer's not
a security officer, and Ducky

12:09.025 --> 12:10.742
says our dead guy
was an impostor.

12:10.744 --> 12:11.943
You tell Gibbs?

12:11.945 --> 12:13.578
I was just about to.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.413
(cell phone ringing)

12:16.416 --> 12:18.700
It's Abby.
What's up, Abbs?

12:18.702 --> 12:21.686
Hey. I got a positive I.D.
on our drowning victim.

12:21.688 --> 12:23.705
His name is Ernesto Vilandro.

12:23.707 --> 12:26.624
He's Venezuelan, and he's
wanted in five countries.

12:26.626 --> 12:28.593
For what?
Piracy, Tony.

12:28.595 --> 12:30.211
I e-mailed you his file

12:30.213 --> 12:32.463
and a list
of all known associates.

12:32.465 --> 12:34.499
Got it.

12:37.437 --> 12:39.237
I know that man.

12:40.390 --> 12:42.223
He's the engineer
on the <i> San Dominick.</i>

12:42.225 --> 12:44.142
Tell Gibbs now.
I'm going back on that ship.

12:44.144 --> 12:46.527
Thank you, Abby.

12:47.397 --> 12:49.163
Gibbs, come in. It's Tony.

12:49.165 --> 12:52.066
The man we found in the water
is wanted for piracy.

12:52.068 --> 12:53.901
There's at least another
pirate on that ship.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.870
Renaldo Aranda, the engineer.

12:55.872 --> 12:57.488
Ship's been compromised.

12:57.490 --> 12:59.707
Watch your six. Over.

13:02.245 --> 13:03.628
Don't answer.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.651
BORIN: Spotter saw armed men
leading members

13:17.653 --> 13:18.886
of the boarding party
below deck.

13:18.888 --> 13:19.854
Ship's compromised.

13:19.856 --> 13:21.121
What about Gibbs?

13:21.123 --> 13:22.523
No word.

13:22.525 --> 13:24.525
How does a band of
armed pirates sneak

13:24.527 --> 13:26.760
onto a U.S. cargo ship
without anyone noticing?

13:26.762 --> 13:28.562
Kind of hoping you'd tell us.

13:28.564 --> 13:30.631
Our victim, Ernesto Vilandro,

13:30.633 --> 13:33.133
got on impersonating
the security officer.

13:33.135 --> 13:35.035
And the real security
officer is...?

13:35.037 --> 13:36.503
BISHOP:
Joe Willis-- last seen

13:36.505 --> 13:38.772
at a Norfolk bar ten days ago.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.808
Got his home address.
Heading there now.

13:40.810 --> 13:42.843
Cross-reference crew records
on the <i> San Dominick.</i>

13:42.845 --> 13:44.344
Verify identities.

13:44.346 --> 13:46.513
We got to weed out
if there's another impostor.

13:46.515 --> 13:49.316
And find out if Vilandro has
any more associates in the area.

13:49.318 --> 13:50.918
On it.
Who's in charge here?

13:50.920 --> 13:52.719
I am.
I am.

13:52.721 --> 13:55.289
It's CAMSLANT, Chesapeake,
calling from shore.

13:55.291 --> 13:56.757
Yeah, I...
I'll...

13:56.759 --> 13:58.358
(clears throat)
I got this.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.127
Vilandro was smart.

14:00.129 --> 14:02.563
Knew the crews on these ships
change all the time.

14:02.565 --> 14:04.865
No one would know
he was an impostor.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.833
Someone realized, Tony.

14:06.835 --> 14:08.969
I got a report
from Interpol.

14:08.971 --> 14:12.272
Last time Vilandro took a
ship was two years ago,

14:12.274 --> 14:14.241
outside the Port of Santos.

14:14.243 --> 14:15.876
He held its captain for ten days

14:15.878 --> 14:17.778
during a standoff
with the Brazilian navy.

14:17.780 --> 14:19.913
Somehow escaped when
they forcibly boarded.

14:19.915 --> 14:22.716
The man he held hostage
was Tom O'Rourke,

14:22.718 --> 14:24.551
captain of the <i> San Dominick.</i>

14:24.553 --> 14:26.887
He happen to mention that to you
when he was brought on board?

14:26.889 --> 14:30.123
No. Uh, he was too busy
bleeding from a stab wound,

14:30.125 --> 14:32.392
but I'll be sure to bring it up.

14:32.394 --> 14:34.094
Now, look,
Gibbs isn't there.

14:34.096 --> 14:35.896
Me, neither.

14:35.898 --> 14:37.898
Listen, McGee,

14:37.900 --> 14:40.166
you're the boss now.

14:40.168 --> 14:42.502
Me? Whoa, whoa, Tony...

14:42.504 --> 14:44.237
Don't mess it up.

14:44.239 --> 14:47.807
Guess you're the boss, boss.

14:47.809 --> 14:50.210
Can he even do that?

14:50.212 --> 14:52.112
TONY:
This is the USS <i> Serano.</i>

14:52.114 --> 14:53.580
Come in,<i> San Dominick.</i>

14:53.582 --> 14:55.315
Repeat:
This is the USS <i> Serano.</i>

14:55.317 --> 14:57.383
Come in,<i> San Dominick.</i>
Can't think. Turn it down.

14:57.385 --> 14:59.118
Over.
How many crew on board?

14:59.120 --> 15:00.720
Twelve.

15:01.655 --> 15:02.789
How many hijackers?

15:02.791 --> 15:04.724
No talking.

15:05.593 --> 15:06.693
How many?

15:06.695 --> 15:07.760
I think six or...

15:07.762 --> 15:09.128
ARANDA:
I say shut up!

15:17.037 --> 15:19.238
<i>Vámonos.</i>

15:19.240 --> 15:21.607
(men speaking Spanish)

15:21.609 --> 15:23.776
Where's the crew being held?

15:23.778 --> 15:25.978
He told us to be quiet.
Where?

15:25.980 --> 15:27.914
Mess deck, all right?
Now, can we just...?

15:27.916 --> 15:30.249
Please.

15:31.885 --> 15:34.687
You hanging in there,
Petty Officer?

15:34.689 --> 15:36.489
Trying, sir.

15:36.491 --> 15:38.691
Can't seem to stop
the bleeding.

15:38.693 --> 15:40.059
Feeling dizzy.

15:40.061 --> 15:42.061
What's your name?

15:43.163 --> 15:45.164
Petty Officer Felton.

15:45.166 --> 15:46.632
No. What's your first name?

15:46.634 --> 15:47.667
Patricia.

15:47.669 --> 15:49.068
People call you Patty?

15:50.837 --> 15:52.738
You hate being called Patty.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.006
(laughs)

15:54.008 --> 15:56.142
(groans)
That's it.

15:56.144 --> 15:59.078
You just keep laughing,
Patricia.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.380
Breathe.

16:01.382 --> 16:02.782
Three in, three out.

16:02.784 --> 16:04.583
(exhales slowly)

16:04.585 --> 16:05.784
What the hell are you doing?

16:07.220 --> 16:08.854
(groans)
MEYERS: She's bleeding, man.

16:08.856 --> 16:10.022
She can't stop it.

16:11.558 --> 16:12.758
I can.

16:12.760 --> 16:13.826
By threatening to shoot her?

16:13.828 --> 16:15.094
Who says it's a threat?

16:16.529 --> 16:18.030
You're in way over your head.

16:20.367 --> 16:21.567
Vilandro--

16:21.569 --> 16:22.935
he's the leader, right?

16:22.937 --> 16:24.903
He's gone. Now it's me.

16:24.905 --> 16:26.438
Well, then lead.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.773
Answer the damn walkie.

16:27.775 --> 16:30.542
Get your ransom
and get off this boat.

16:31.444 --> 16:32.911
Breathe.

16:32.913 --> 16:35.581
In-- one, two, three.

16:36.483 --> 16:38.050
Attention, USS <i> Serano.</i>

16:38.052 --> 16:39.485
This is the <i> San Dominick.</i>

16:39.487 --> 16:40.719
We read you,<i> San Dominick.</i>

16:40.721 --> 16:42.454
This is NCIS
Special Agent DiNozzo.

16:42.456 --> 16:44.756
We want $10 million
in unmarked bills

16:44.758 --> 16:46.358
delivered in one hour's time,

16:46.360 --> 16:49.094
or I'll shoot a hostage
and toss them overboard.

16:51.064 --> 16:53.265
This is Special Agent
Abigail Borin.

16:53.267 --> 16:54.733
Is this Renaldo Aranda?
Look, uh,

16:54.735 --> 16:56.401
we're happy to talk
to you about money,

16:56.403 --> 16:58.437
but first we need
a status report on the...

16:58.439 --> 17:00.672
You now have 59 minutes.

17:05.310 --> 17:06.978
McGEE:
Joe Willis?

17:06.980 --> 17:09.247
Open up. NCIS.

17:11.184 --> 17:12.684
(knocks)

17:12.685 --> 17:16.087
Mr. Willis, we need to
ask you a few questions.

17:16.923 --> 17:19.089
What do we do, boss?

17:19.925 --> 17:22.193
Please stop calling me that.

17:25.298 --> 17:27.332
Unlocked.
Mmm.

17:35.541 --> 17:37.709
Ah, it's every smell I
can't stand rolled into...

17:37.711 --> 17:39.344
one super smell.

17:39.346 --> 17:40.945
Yeah. Willis lived alone.

17:40.947 --> 17:43.481
I don't know why it looks
like a frat party exploded.

17:43.483 --> 17:45.550
Kitchen or bathroom?
Where do you want me?

17:45.552 --> 17:47.552
Take the kitchen.

17:47.554 --> 17:49.187
Okay.

18:06.004 --> 18:08.172
Got boxes of ammo.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.975
7.62 millimeter.

18:10.977 --> 18:12.643
A lot of them.

18:12.645 --> 18:14.645
Guess we know where
the hijackers were staying.

18:14.647 --> 18:17.882
Yeah, I think I know how they
snuck on the <i> San Dominick,</i> too.

18:17.884 --> 18:18.950
Falsified their I.D.'s

18:18.952 --> 18:20.818
and walked on
with the rest of the crew.

18:20.820 --> 18:22.820
Mmm. Oof.

18:23.622 --> 18:25.456
That leaves two questions:

18:25.458 --> 18:27.091
Was Joe Willis a conspirator?

18:27.093 --> 18:30.027
And... what exactly
is in this jar?

18:30.029 --> 18:31.862
It's...

18:31.864 --> 18:33.297
urine, isn't it?

18:33.299 --> 18:35.399
Would it have killed them
to use the bathroom?

18:38.537 --> 18:41.072
I'm gonna go with yes.

18:48.613 --> 18:50.214
MAN (over speaker):
Flight deck, stand by.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.649
Hot refuel in progress.

18:51.651 --> 18:53.717
All others, stand clear
of the flight deck.

18:53.719 --> 18:55.085
Give us a second? Thanks.

18:55.087 --> 18:56.420
Sir.

18:56.422 --> 18:57.955
Captain?

18:57.957 --> 19:01.091
(over speaker): Security team Bravo,
security team Bravo...

19:02.027 --> 19:03.894
Where am I?

19:03.896 --> 19:06.263
On the USS <i> Serano.</i>

19:06.265 --> 19:07.865
And my ship?

19:07.867 --> 19:09.466
It's being held by pirates.

19:09.468 --> 19:11.402
I should be there. (groans)
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:11.404 --> 19:12.703
You're not going anywhere,

19:12.705 --> 19:14.438
except a medevac
to Norfolk.

19:15.039 --> 19:17.107
O'ROURKE:
I, uh...

19:17.109 --> 19:19.209
I had a package of chew
in my shirt pocket.

19:19.211 --> 19:20.911
Is there any chance
that's around?

19:20.913 --> 19:23.146
Your shirt's in an evidence bag.
Ah.

19:23.148 --> 19:26.149
Time I quit anyway.
It's a bad habit.

19:26.151 --> 19:28.719
So you want
to tell me what happened?

19:28.721 --> 19:33.590
Trip like this, your eyes
scan the horizon for pirates.

19:33.592 --> 19:37.361
Never expected them to be part
of my own crew.

19:37.363 --> 19:39.496
Yeah, that's what's
giving me trouble.

19:39.498 --> 19:40.731
You didn't notice
that the guy

19:40.733 --> 19:42.132
that took your
boat hostage today

19:42.134 --> 19:44.801
is the same guy who took you
hostage two years ago?

19:44.803 --> 19:47.304
I did notice.
There's not a detail

19:47.306 --> 19:50.907
about Ernesto Vilandro
I haven't committed to memory.

19:54.145 --> 19:56.546
I had to stop him.

19:56.548 --> 20:01.084
Hijackers had locked the crew up
in the mess.

20:01.086 --> 20:05.488
But Vilandro needed me
to work the comm.

20:05.490 --> 20:07.490
It was just him and me.

20:07.492 --> 20:08.925
You jumped him?

20:08.927 --> 20:11.728
I wasn't giving up my ship.
Not to Vilandro, not again.

20:13.564 --> 20:15.665
Radio got smashed
in the fight.

20:15.667 --> 20:17.233
I threw Vilandro overboard,

20:17.235 --> 20:20.336
hoped somebody
would find the body.

20:20.338 --> 20:22.439
MAN (over radio):
Helo's ready, sir.

20:22.441 --> 20:24.073
Copy that.

20:25.109 --> 20:26.643
TONY:
O'Rourke's medevac left.

20:26.645 --> 20:28.311
He's en route to Norfolk.

20:28.313 --> 20:31.447
Hour's up.
Time to contact Aranda.

20:31.449 --> 20:36.386
So, what are you gonna say to
him when he asks for his money?

20:36.388 --> 20:40.223
Well, Tony, I'm gonna ask him
his preference in powerboats.

20:40.225 --> 20:41.958
Did you know there are
17 distinct categories

20:41.960 --> 20:44.060
of fast boats?
I did not.

20:44.062 --> 20:46.529
It's Hostage Negotiation
101, DiNozzo.

20:46.531 --> 20:49.465
You keep 'em stalled,
keep 'em calm,

20:49.467 --> 20:51.401
keep 'em talking.

20:51.403 --> 20:52.902
Just like dating.

20:53.737 --> 20:55.171
You ready?

20:55.173 --> 20:56.806
Oh, yeah.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.643
(clears throat)

21:02.012 --> 21:03.412
This is the USS <i> Serano</i>

21:03.414 --> 21:04.981
to the <i> San Dominick.</i> Come in.

21:04.983 --> 21:06.182
You have my money?

21:06.184 --> 21:07.283
We're close.

21:07.285 --> 21:08.551
My boss signed off
on the request.

21:08.553 --> 21:10.219
The bank's
processing it.

21:10.221 --> 21:12.388
Shouldn't be long.
You're stalling, and it won't work.

21:13.557 --> 21:15.391
Look, you asked
for $10 million.

21:15.393 --> 21:18.060
It's a little more complicated
than a walk down to the ATM.

21:18.062 --> 21:20.429
So, while we're waiting
for your money,

21:20.431 --> 21:22.131
why don't we talk escape boats?

21:22.133 --> 21:23.499
I like the bowrider myself.

21:23.501 --> 21:24.934
I don't want a damn boat.

21:24.936 --> 21:27.236
This isn't a negotiation.
It's a demand.

21:27.238 --> 21:28.871
Blood's on your hands now.

21:28.873 --> 21:30.806
Okay. All right, hold on.

21:30.808 --> 21:32.775
Let's just
take a breath.

21:32.777 --> 21:34.877
We don't need
any more blood.

21:34.879 --> 21:36.846
Hello?

21:36.848 --> 21:38.847
On your feet. Get up now!
What?

21:38.849 --> 21:40.783
Come on, man!
Let her go, let her go.

21:42.385 --> 21:43.811
You want to take her place?!

21:43.811 --> 21:45.377
Huh?!

21:48.014 --> 21:50.048
I do.

21:59.541 --> 22:01.075
I don't care
how you get it.

22:01.077 --> 22:02.843
<i>San Dominick,</i> come in.
This is USS <i> Serano.</i>

22:02.845 --> 22:06.413
I have your cash, but I
need you to respond. Over.

22:06.415 --> 22:08.148
Oh, now you have the money, huh?

22:08.150 --> 22:09.250
TONY:
It's close.

22:09.252 --> 22:10.584
I'd say 30 minutes.

22:10.586 --> 22:11.785
Okay, seriously,
I will take counterfeit.

22:11.787 --> 22:12.920
Hell, I will take
Monopoly money.

22:12.922 --> 22:14.822
Maybe 40.

22:14.824 --> 22:16.857
Still stalling. You're
still trying to trick me.

22:16.859 --> 22:19.159
The only way you take me
seriously is with a bullet.

22:19.161 --> 22:21.462
Look, we're getting your money,
and as soon as we do,

22:21.464 --> 22:23.364
I will bring it
to you personally.

22:23.366 --> 22:24.865
You and how many snipers, huh?

22:24.867 --> 22:25.999
No snipers.

22:26.001 --> 22:27.868
No tricks; just me.

22:27.870 --> 22:29.036
And I'm supposed to believe you?

22:29.038 --> 22:30.571
Look, you chose
this line of work.

22:30.573 --> 22:31.939
You kicked our hornet's nest.

22:31.941 --> 22:33.540
I'm just saying nobody
else has to get hurt.

22:33.542 --> 22:34.875
You're wrong, though.

22:34.877 --> 22:36.210
Your man's going to be hurt.

22:36.212 --> 22:37.311
My man?

22:37.313 --> 22:38.378
You mean Gibbs?

22:38.380 --> 22:39.813
I'm going to make
an example of him.

22:39.815 --> 22:41.048
<i>Muévete!</i> Move!

22:41.050 --> 22:43.183
Hey, man, listen. I get it.

22:43.185 --> 22:45.686
Gibbs can be grumpy,
incommunicative, stubborn.

22:45.688 --> 22:48.188
That's no reason...
Enough. Say good-bye.

22:48.190 --> 22:49.790
I'm working with you here.

22:49.792 --> 22:51.558
Well, now, because
I have the power,

22:51.560 --> 22:53.160
and you people,
you people...

22:53.995 --> 22:56.296
(groaning, gunfire over radio)

22:57.198 --> 22:58.298
Hello?

22:58.300 --> 22:59.966
Is anybody there?

22:59.968 --> 23:03.236
I need a response. I need
to talk to Gibbs right now.

23:07.341 --> 23:09.409
GIBBS:
Hey, Tony. It's me.

23:09.411 --> 23:11.111
I'm fine.

23:11.113 --> 23:13.146
Can't say the same for Aranda.

23:13.148 --> 23:15.315
(panting)

23:19.020 --> 23:21.955
DUCKY: I know, in the end,
we all must die.

23:21.957 --> 23:24.758
And I am not a religious person.

23:24.760 --> 23:27.394
But I find desecration
of the human body

23:27.396 --> 23:30.430
to be positively indecent.
(elevator bell dings)

23:30.432 --> 23:32.866
Well, pirates aren't known
for their decency, Duck.

23:34.101 --> 23:35.902
Something wrong?
No, Timothy,

23:35.904 --> 23:38.304
but I requested
you dispense with the coffee

23:38.306 --> 23:40.173
before joining me.

23:43.744 --> 23:45.278
Joe Willis drown?

23:45.280 --> 23:47.547
The cause of death
was asphyxiation.

23:47.549 --> 23:49.215
And the bathtub
he was floating in?

23:49.217 --> 23:51.417
Mr. Willis was most
likely left in the water

23:51.419 --> 23:54.053
to control odor
and decomposition.

23:54.055 --> 23:56.756
Can being submerged
in water control decomp?

23:56.758 --> 23:58.925
Not water alone,
but as you can see,

23:58.927 --> 24:00.993
there are traces of
chemicals on his skin,

24:00.995 --> 24:04.063
specifically
benzethonium chloride,

24:04.065 --> 24:06.599
cetrimide and good
old-fashioned ammonia.

24:06.601 --> 24:10.536
These would certainly slow
the decaying of the tissue.

24:10.538 --> 24:11.904
How long has he been dead?

24:11.906 --> 24:13.506
It's hard to
be precise.

24:13.508 --> 24:15.808
Five to seven days.

24:15.810 --> 24:19.946
The killer or killers clearly
wanted to preserve his body.

24:19.948 --> 24:21.681
While they used his apartment
while planning their hijacking.

24:21.683 --> 24:23.282
Thanks, Duck.

24:25.018 --> 24:27.953
MAN [over radio]:
Renaldo... (speaks Spanish) (groaning)

24:27.955 --> 24:30.723
(whimpering
and groaning)

24:30.725 --> 24:32.158
Renaldo.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.726
(gasping)

24:33.728 --> 24:34.994
Renaldo... (speaks Spanish)

24:34.996 --> 24:36.796
(whimpering)

24:37.664 --> 24:39.465
Stay still.

24:39.467 --> 24:40.499
(groaning)

24:40.501 --> 24:41.967
(man speaks Spanish over radio)

24:41.969 --> 24:43.102
That's all you're gonna do?

24:43.104 --> 24:44.170
I'm stopping the bleeding.

24:44.172 --> 24:45.704
I need medical attention.

24:45.706 --> 24:49.241
What you need to do...
is respond to your friend.

24:49.243 --> 24:52.011
(man speaking Spanish)
And tell him you're <i> bueno.</i>

24:52.013 --> 24:53.479
Or I can just untie this.

24:53.481 --> 24:54.847
(rapid panting)

24:54.849 --> 24:56.615
Okay. Okay.

24:58.852 --> 25:01.453
(speaking Spanish)

25:05.191 --> 25:07.593
(man speaking Spanish
over radio)

25:08.661 --> 25:11.063
Okay. Okay.

25:11.065 --> 25:12.464
(sighs heavily)

25:12.466 --> 25:14.366
Now... you talk.

25:14.368 --> 25:16.568
What do you want? What-what...
what do you want to hear?

25:16.570 --> 25:18.237
You told me
that you're the leader.

25:18.239 --> 25:19.738
The leader-- he knows.

25:19.740 --> 25:23.275
Vilandro--
he was the real leader.

25:23.277 --> 25:26.645
Outfitted us,
got us fake papers.

25:26.647 --> 25:28.680
(groaning)
What's the plan?

25:28.682 --> 25:30.549
We... (panting)

25:30.551 --> 25:33.018
We take the boat out of port.

25:33.020 --> 25:35.821
Then we contact
the shipping company for ransom.

25:35.823 --> 25:39.591
Then escape boat
comes and meets us.

25:39.593 --> 25:41.660
Simple, clean.

25:41.662 --> 25:43.261
You can't contact
the shipping company.

25:43.263 --> 25:45.397
You destroyed the radio.
That wasn't us.

25:45.399 --> 25:48.266
Vilandro-- he went to the
radio room with the captain,

25:48.268 --> 25:49.868
and they fought.

25:49.870 --> 25:51.770
Everything fell apart
after that.

25:51.772 --> 25:53.405
I saw you
and four others.

25:53.407 --> 25:55.006
You have another man
on this ship.

25:56.909 --> 25:58.743
(groans, pants)

25:58.745 --> 26:00.812
You think you're in control now,

26:00.814 --> 26:03.415
but you're not.
When the others come,

26:03.417 --> 26:05.717
they're gonna kill you.
Who's the sixth man?

26:05.719 --> 26:07.118
(yells, gasps)

26:07.120 --> 26:08.620
Wait.

26:08.622 --> 26:09.954
Where is he?

26:09.956 --> 26:11.656
Deck four.

26:11.658 --> 26:14.692
Vilandro sent him there to
guard a shipping container

26:14.694 --> 26:16.795
right before the fight
with the captain.

26:16.797 --> 26:18.730
I don't know why. I swear.

26:18.732 --> 26:20.398
I swear. I swear.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.967
Now, you were telling me,
who is in control?

26:22.969 --> 26:25.703
ABBY:
<i>What did you find, Bishop?</i>

26:25.705 --> 26:28.239
Anything interesting?
Tons.

26:28.241 --> 26:30.808
It's Vilandro's computer
from Joe Willis's place.

26:30.810 --> 26:32.677
It's filled
with encrypted e-mails.

26:32.679 --> 26:34.445
Shipping timetables,
port security codes,

26:34.447 --> 26:36.214
petty-cash drops
for the hijackers.

26:36.216 --> 26:39.751
I mean, someone planned and
financed this whole operation.

26:39.753 --> 26:41.219
Just can't tell you who yet.

26:41.221 --> 26:42.654
McGEE:
What do you got, Abbs?

26:42.656 --> 26:44.422
Well, uh, I've been

26:44.424 --> 26:47.058
combing through all the evidence
from Joe Willis's apartment.

26:47.060 --> 26:48.793
What'd you find in this garbage?

26:49.928 --> 26:52.697
It may look like garbage
to the untrained eye,

26:52.699 --> 26:55.433
but to me,
every moldy food wrapper

26:55.435 --> 26:57.502
and every soggy cigarette butt--

26:57.504 --> 27:00.271
it just fills in
a vast mosaic.

27:00.273 --> 27:01.405
Details, Abbs.

27:01.407 --> 27:04.008
Um, well, one of our hijackers,

27:04.010 --> 27:06.477
uh, is lactose intolerant.

27:06.479 --> 27:08.546
Uh, two others
are vegetarians.

27:08.548 --> 27:10.715
One is suffering from IBS.

27:10.717 --> 27:12.116
Fewer details, Abbs.

27:13.151 --> 27:15.386
I'm running eight
distinct DNA samples

27:15.388 --> 27:17.154
to try to I.D. the hijackers.

27:17.156 --> 27:18.923
I'm just waiting for results.

27:18.925 --> 27:20.257
But what about
the chemicals

27:20.259 --> 27:22.026
Ducky found on
Joe Willis's body?

27:22.028 --> 27:24.228
Dead-animal deodorizer,
and a lot of it.

27:24.230 --> 27:25.996
BISHOP:
My dad always had a jug

27:25.998 --> 27:27.965
of that stuff
when I was growing up.

27:27.967 --> 27:30.801
Covers the smell and stops
the infestation of flies.

27:30.803 --> 27:32.203
And you use enough of it,

27:32.205 --> 27:33.871
it'll do the same thing
for a dead man.

27:33.873 --> 27:36.640
Anything else?
Um...

27:36.642 --> 27:37.942
just these numbers.

27:37.944 --> 27:39.944
Uh, Gibbs found them
on a slip of paper

27:39.946 --> 27:41.812
at the crime scene
on the <i> San Dominick.</i>

27:41.814 --> 27:44.114
I'm not sure what they are
yet, but I am all over it.

27:44.116 --> 27:45.482
It's good work, Abbs.

27:45.484 --> 27:46.950
Gosh, I just
got chills.

27:46.952 --> 27:48.319
Why is that?

27:48.321 --> 27:50.954
You're just... changing

27:50.956 --> 27:52.990
right in front
of our eyes.

27:52.992 --> 27:55.025
Your gruff
manner, your...

27:55.027 --> 27:56.693
your clipped replies.

27:56.695 --> 27:58.896
You're no
longer McGee.

27:58.898 --> 28:00.564
You're McGibbs.

28:00.566 --> 28:02.833
What?! That's...

28:02.835 --> 28:04.535
Wait. What?!

28:04.537 --> 28:06.069
It's true.

28:06.071 --> 28:07.871
Ever since
Tony put you in charge.

28:07.873 --> 28:09.506
You're, like... channeling him.

28:09.508 --> 28:11.608
Stop it.
ABBY: You got it,

28:11.610 --> 28:13.777
boss.

28:14.879 --> 28:17.914
Hey, MSRT's ready
when you are.

28:17.916 --> 28:20.584
Abby got positive I.D.'s
on several of the hijackers.

28:20.586 --> 28:22.919
It doesn't add up.

28:22.921 --> 28:25.622
Look like an evil boy band.
Exactly.

28:25.624 --> 28:27.924
Matches came
from the Brazilian DNA database.

28:27.926 --> 28:29.726
So they all have
criminal records?

28:29.728 --> 28:31.795
You know, car theft,
shoplifting.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.396
None of them are serious felons.

28:33.398 --> 28:36.099
Yet someone smuggled them
over the border, financed them

28:36.101 --> 28:37.968
and sent them
onto the <i> San Dominick.</i>

28:37.970 --> 28:40.036
Pirates usually
aren't sophisticated enough

28:40.038 --> 28:42.706
to falsify I.D.'s and
override security systems.

28:42.708 --> 28:45.542
These pirates were.
We're missing something.

28:45.544 --> 28:48.111
Well, maybe we'll find it
on that boat.

28:51.048 --> 28:52.315
I've already told you,

28:52.317 --> 28:54.884
we do not comment
on active operations.

28:54.886 --> 28:57.487
You want to try calling my boss,
go right ahead.

28:57.489 --> 28:59.522
Got to go now. Bye.

28:59.524 --> 29:01.458
(phone ringing)

29:01.460 --> 29:03.827
Go for McGee.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.161
Dorneget?

29:05.163 --> 29:07.063
Don't have any updates yet.
Tony and Borin

29:07.065 --> 29:09.299
are taking the ship now.
I'm waiting for a sitrep.

29:09.301 --> 29:10.700
Got to go, Ned.

29:10.702 --> 29:12.769
(phone ringing)

29:12.771 --> 29:15.972
Well, I see you didn't waste
any time going over my...

29:15.974 --> 29:17.840
Oh, Director.

29:17.842 --> 29:20.243
Uh, sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

29:20.245 --> 29:21.978
Never mind.

29:21.980 --> 29:24.314
Yes. Uh, no, nothing yet.

29:24.316 --> 29:25.948
I will.
(phone ringing)

29:25.950 --> 29:28.117
Thanks.

29:28.119 --> 29:30.353
Bishop, phone's ringing.

29:30.355 --> 29:32.422
Bishop?!
You say something?

29:32.424 --> 29:33.756
Yeah. What do you got?

29:33.758 --> 29:37.059
Oh. Um, I ran a trace
on these encrypted e-mails.

29:37.061 --> 29:38.761
They were buried
in a Trojan horse

29:38.763 --> 29:40.363
that bounced
all over the country

29:40.365 --> 29:41.764
through infected host computers.

29:41.766 --> 29:43.332
So, I pinpointed the origin,

29:43.334 --> 29:45.001
and it's a Kinko's
outside Norfolk.

29:45.003 --> 29:46.536
Oh, our mastermind's a local.

29:46.538 --> 29:47.770
They have dozens of customers

29:47.772 --> 29:49.438
renting computer time
by the hour.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.474
We'll need more if we want
to zero in on a suspect.

29:51.476 --> 29:52.942
ABBY: I know what
the numbers mean.

29:52.944 --> 29:55.264
I know what the numbers mean.
I know what the numbers mean.

29:56.179 --> 29:58.547
McGee, what are you doing?

29:58.549 --> 30:01.851
What? I'm just standing.
At Gibbs' desk.

30:01.853 --> 30:04.120
Abby, you said you know
what the number means.

30:04.122 --> 30:05.287
What numbers?

30:05.289 --> 30:06.789
The numbers...

30:06.791 --> 30:08.524
that Gibbs found
at the crime scene.

30:08.526 --> 30:10.993
I thought maybe they were
lottery numbers or coordinates.

30:10.995 --> 30:13.262
But I was wrong,
but I was kind of right.

30:13.264 --> 30:14.697
Explain.

30:14.699 --> 30:16.165
It's a locator number

30:16.167 --> 30:18.400
for a shipping container
from the <i> San Dominick.</i>

30:18.402 --> 30:19.902
What's inside?

30:19.904 --> 30:21.837
It's not what's
in the shipping container

30:21.839 --> 30:24.239
that's important.
It's who owns it.

30:24.241 --> 30:27.142
A company called LCD Liquidated.

30:27.144 --> 30:30.212
They have a cursory Web site,
and a voice mail,

30:30.214 --> 30:33.048
and about 50 shipping containers
that are traveling

30:33.050 --> 30:36.051
around the world
pretty much constantly.

30:36.053 --> 30:37.686
Usually export out of the U.S.

30:37.688 --> 30:38.987
And ending up in countries

30:38.989 --> 30:40.722
with secretive
banking practices.

30:40.724 --> 30:42.057
And they are being investigated

30:42.059 --> 30:44.092
by U.S. Customs
for money smuggling.

30:44.094 --> 30:45.828
Drug money, specifically.

30:45.830 --> 30:48.530
I'm talking tens of millions
of dollars in one container.

30:48.532 --> 30:50.098
This isn't about ransom at all.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.035
Rule number 70-- keep digging
till you hit bottom.

30:54.003 --> 30:55.604
McGee!

30:56.706 --> 30:58.206
There is no rule 70.

30:58.208 --> 31:00.709
Well, I'm...
You just made up a rule.

31:00.711 --> 31:04.046
This McGibbs thing has
really gone to your head.

31:05.148 --> 31:07.582
I don't even recognize you
right now.

31:10.620 --> 31:13.155
(Renaldo panting)

31:14.690 --> 31:16.658
(panting,
speaks Spanish)

31:20.296 --> 31:21.630
(speaking Spanish)

31:23.232 --> 31:25.967
We heard that
gunshot before.

31:25.969 --> 31:27.702
We were sure you were dead.

31:27.704 --> 31:29.704
Patricia?

31:29.706 --> 31:31.873
They took her
right after Aranda grabbed you.

31:31.875 --> 31:33.308
Well, where is she?

31:41.250 --> 31:42.250
Jaime?

31:42.252 --> 31:44.018
What happened
to you, man?

31:44.020 --> 31:46.421
You sent her down here
to be a hostage.

31:46.423 --> 31:48.990
My insurance policy.

31:48.992 --> 31:51.459
Where's the container he
was supposed to be guarding?

31:51.461 --> 31:53.261
It's this one.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.634
He probably got lost
somewhere down here,

31:59.636 --> 32:02.170
but this is the container.

32:02.172 --> 32:03.771
Sit down.

32:05.941 --> 32:07.875
(grunts)

32:11.013 --> 32:12.847
TONY:
Boss, where are you?

32:12.849 --> 32:15.083
Deck four.

32:15.085 --> 32:16.150
We've taken the ship.

32:16.152 --> 32:17.318
We have the rest
of the hijackers.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.519
We're on our way.

32:28.063 --> 32:29.864
Is that a bomb?

32:31.166 --> 32:34.135
Tony?

32:41.076 --> 32:42.343
Just to be clear...

32:42.345 --> 32:44.512
that's not our bomb.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.074
Drop it.

32:58.673 --> 32:59.939
Now!

32:59.941 --> 33:01.107
You want to tell your boy here

33:01.109 --> 33:02.808
to ease up
on his trigger finger?

33:02.810 --> 33:04.577
Soon as you and your people
leave this ship.

33:04.579 --> 33:07.146
Turn off your bomb,
we'll talk about it.

33:07.148 --> 33:09.015
ARANDA:
I already told you,

33:09.017 --> 33:10.282
it's not our bomb.

33:10.284 --> 33:12.018
Then whose is it?
Don't know.

33:12.020 --> 33:15.054
But it's going off
one way or another.

33:15.056 --> 33:16.288
Not if I disarm it.

33:16.290 --> 33:17.256
You can do that?

33:17.258 --> 33:18.657
Do it.

33:18.659 --> 33:21.460
Drop the weapon first
and release the petty officer.

33:36.409 --> 33:38.177
You down here, boss?

33:38.179 --> 33:40.012
Got a bomb down here, DiNozzo!

33:40.014 --> 33:42.247
I need you
to evacuate the ship.

33:42.249 --> 33:43.749
We need to evacuate the ship.

33:43.751 --> 33:45.351
We have a bomb on four.

33:45.353 --> 33:47.553
BORIN: We already left
you on this ship once.

33:47.555 --> 33:49.855
You see how much
trouble you got into?

33:49.857 --> 33:52.257
I guess it's up to you, Jaime.

33:54.794 --> 33:56.495
Well, you're scared.

33:56.497 --> 33:58.163
Means you're smart.

33:58.165 --> 34:01.300
A smart man wouldn't be here.

34:01.302 --> 34:03.001
TONY: Got you
covered, boss.

34:03.003 --> 34:04.903
How's the timer
on that bomb looking?

34:04.905 --> 34:07.039
Less than three minutes.
TONY: I just spoke to McGee.

34:07.041 --> 34:08.106
He said the empty container

34:08.108 --> 34:09.708
was supposed to be filled
with drug money.

34:09.710 --> 34:11.091
Hey. Where's the money?

34:11.114 --> 34:12.844
The container was empty
when I got here.

34:12.846 --> 34:15.147
Millions of dollars
don't just walk off.

34:16.783 --> 34:19.451
The only thing
we wanted was ransom.

34:19.453 --> 34:21.620
Then the escape boat
comes and...

34:21.621 --> 34:22.821
and we go home.

34:22.822 --> 34:24.856
GIBBS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Clean and simple.

34:24.858 --> 34:26.757
You told that story before.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.393
You said you didn't want a boat.

34:28.395 --> 34:30.462
Because you were
expecting one.

34:30.464 --> 34:33.197
Yeah. And it'll be here.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.266
Soon.

34:35.268 --> 34:37.802
BORIN: One of our agents found
the operational plans

34:37.804 --> 34:40.572
for this hijacking,
and here's the thing.

34:40.574 --> 34:43.775
Not one word
about an escape boat.

34:45.077 --> 34:46.244
What are you saying?

34:46.246 --> 34:48.346
There is no boat.

34:48.348 --> 34:50.447
You were never supposed
to get away.

34:50.449 --> 34:53.418
You were set up to take
the fall on this ship.

34:53.420 --> 34:55.652
BORIN: You steal tens of millions
of dollars from the cartel,

34:55.655 --> 34:56.955
they will come after you.

34:56.956 --> 34:58.156
TONY: But not if
you're already dead.

34:58.158 --> 35:00.191
That's what the bomb was for.

35:00.193 --> 35:01.693
It's like <i> Die Hard</i> on a ship.

35:02.394 --> 35:04.095
BORIN:
One minute, Gibbs.

35:04.097 --> 35:06.030
Come on, man. You're a fool.

35:07.266 --> 35:08.666
Time to end this.

35:12.671 --> 35:14.806
Jaime...

35:14.808 --> 35:16.474
(panting)

35:16.476 --> 35:18.476
...listen to him.

35:18.478 --> 35:20.244
There's no boat. There's no...

35:20.246 --> 35:21.779
no way out.

35:21.781 --> 35:24.082
You need to give up, man.
No!

35:24.983 --> 35:26.718
Shoot him, sir.
I'll take my chances.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.287
Yeah, you got it.
JAIME: Everybody shut up!

35:29.289 --> 35:31.622
(panting)

35:32.157 --> 35:33.958
TONY:
35 seconds.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.793
Running out of time, boss.

35:35.795 --> 35:37.528
Jaime, you got two choices:

35:37.530 --> 35:39.797
You drop the weapon
and I defuse the bomb,

35:39.799 --> 35:42.233
or I shoot you
and I defuse the bomb.

35:45.737 --> 35:47.838
BORIN:
20 seconds.

35:47.840 --> 35:48.840
Boss?

35:51.410 --> 35:53.444
ARANDA:
Okay.

35:53.446 --> 35:54.478
BORIN:
Twelve.

35:54.480 --> 35:55.980
Wh-What are you doing?
Defuse it!

35:55.982 --> 35:57.848
Please.
BORIN: Ten.

35:57.850 --> 35:58.816
Gibbs, the bomb.

35:58.818 --> 36:00.384
Seven, six,

36:00.386 --> 36:02.086
five,
Boss?

36:02.088 --> 36:04.388
four... Gibbs!

36:04.390 --> 36:05.390
Two...

36:13.565 --> 36:15.299
(chuckles)

36:15.301 --> 36:18.269
You removed that when you first
saw the bomb, didn't you?

36:18.271 --> 36:20.437
(chuckles)

36:25.744 --> 36:27.444
You okay?

36:27.446 --> 36:29.046
(Borin clears throat)

36:29.881 --> 36:31.815
Ow.

36:33.618 --> 36:35.619
This is Special Agent
Abigail Borin.

36:35.621 --> 36:37.488
The <i> San Dominick</i> is secure.

36:37.490 --> 36:39.456
Bringing up two
prisoners and we need

36:39.458 --> 36:42.192
immediate medical attention
for a petty officer.

36:42.194 --> 36:44.628
Money was never on the ship.
Someone took it off.

36:44.630 --> 36:48.232
Uh-huh. Boy, that bomb thing,
that was kind of fun.

36:48.234 --> 36:49.967
Right? Next time,
you might want to give us

36:49.969 --> 36:51.268
a heads-up, though,
'cause...

36:51.270 --> 36:52.769
I didn't pack a diaper.

36:54.572 --> 36:57.307
Oh, what do we have here?

36:57.309 --> 36:58.475
What do you got?

37:00.445 --> 37:02.646
Bad habit.

37:08.019 --> 37:09.853
TONY:
Hey.

37:09.855 --> 37:12.389
I brought this to the hospital
this morning.

37:12.391 --> 37:15.392
I couldn't find you.
Old Pelton, right?

37:15.394 --> 37:17.260
That's my brand.
Yeah.

37:17.262 --> 37:19.763
We matched it to the spit
we found in the container,

37:19.765 --> 37:21.431
right next to the bomb
you rigged.

37:21.433 --> 37:22.599
Got your DNA, too.

37:22.601 --> 37:23.733
I don't know what...

37:23.735 --> 37:25.168
BORIN:
Hands up.

37:25.170 --> 37:26.903
Where I can see 'em.

37:26.905 --> 37:28.672
Up.

37:28.674 --> 37:31.107
You're a clever
guy, Captain.

37:31.109 --> 37:32.575
Planned a hijacking
as a distraction

37:32.577 --> 37:34.711
while you robbed the cartels.

37:34.713 --> 37:36.813
We almost didn't catch you.
Ah.

37:36.815 --> 37:39.015
Only we found security footage

37:39.017 --> 37:44.187
of you buying $1,000 worth
of dead-animal deodorizer.

37:44.189 --> 37:46.489
Two blocks from the Kinko's
where you sent encrypted e-mails

37:46.491 --> 37:48.525
to the gang
that couldn't shoot straight.

37:48.527 --> 37:51.160
Yeah. You dream that up
with your pal Vilandro

37:51.162 --> 37:52.729
while he held you hostage?

37:52.731 --> 37:54.664
Or maybe he
was the brains,

37:54.666 --> 37:56.266
the Butch to your Sundance.

37:56.268 --> 37:58.001
Only Sundance
wouldn't drown Butch

37:58.003 --> 37:59.369
during a knife fight, would he?

37:59.371 --> 38:01.104
Wouldn't treat a friend
like that.

38:01.106 --> 38:03.439
He wasn't my friend.

38:03.441 --> 38:05.508
Just a business partner.

38:06.610 --> 38:09.011
We're not getting through,
are we?

38:09.013 --> 38:10.580
BORIN:
That's all right.

38:10.582 --> 38:12.648
I have a feeling
that the cartels have people

38:12.650 --> 38:15.985
that can be... very persuasive.

38:15.987 --> 38:19.155
That bastard tortured me
for ten days,

38:19.157 --> 38:20.857
made me beg
for my life,

38:20.859 --> 38:22.758
humiliated me

38:22.760 --> 38:25.628
and then somehow thought I was
going into business with him.

38:25.630 --> 38:28.631
I only needed him
to set up the hijacking.

38:28.633 --> 38:30.132
You always planned to kill him.

38:30.134 --> 38:32.535
He figured out
I'd taken the money

38:32.537 --> 38:35.504
off the container
before we even left port.

38:35.506 --> 38:37.473
He was angry.

38:37.475 --> 38:39.175
He got what he deserved.

38:39.177 --> 38:40.810
So will you.

38:48.185 --> 38:49.785
Hey. Still here,
Borin?

38:49.787 --> 38:51.220
Admit it,
I'm growing on you.

38:51.222 --> 38:52.321
Like a barnacle.

38:52.323 --> 38:53.456
No, I'm just
transferring O'Rourke

38:53.458 --> 38:55.324
to Federal Detention,
and then I am gone.

38:55.326 --> 38:56.625
Well, good working
with you.

38:56.627 --> 38:59.028
Hey, you know, if you ever
want to make a change,

38:59.030 --> 39:00.129
there's room on my team.

39:00.131 --> 39:01.363
(chuckles)
Be your number two?

39:01.365 --> 39:03.532
Oh, no, no, no.
Omagi's my number two.

39:03.534 --> 39:06.368
But you'd make
a solid number three.

39:06.370 --> 39:08.203
See you!

39:08.205 --> 39:10.706
Borin.

39:10.708 --> 39:12.441
Well, McGee,

39:12.443 --> 39:15.010
I just want you to
know I'm proud of you.

39:15.012 --> 39:16.545
You didn't blow
anything up,

39:16.547 --> 39:18.447
and there were no
international incidents.

39:19.682 --> 39:21.550
You're gonna make
a good boss someday.

39:21.552 --> 39:22.785
Thank you, Tony.

39:22.787 --> 39:26.555
So, I watched <i> Star</i>
<i>Trek II</i> last night.

39:26.557 --> 39:28.156
Kobayashi Maru.

39:28.158 --> 39:29.925
I totally get it now.

39:29.927 --> 39:33.128
I figured out how Gibbs
passed the boarding exercise.

39:34.697 --> 39:36.531
He fixed it. Just...

39:36.533 --> 39:37.966
like Captain Kirk. Mm-hmm.

39:37.968 --> 39:40.102
I'm gonna ask him
about it tomorrow.

39:40.937 --> 39:42.204
You're going to accuse the boss

39:42.206 --> 39:45.107
of cheating on an official test?

39:46.209 --> 39:48.076
Sounded better in my head.

39:48.078 --> 39:49.678
TONY: Yeah.
Yeah.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.480
This is what happens
when I'm not around

39:51.482 --> 39:52.647
for a little while.

39:52.649 --> 39:54.249
Walk with me, Bishop.
Let me explain.

39:54.251 --> 39:56.218
The things that happen in your head,
Mm-hmm.

39:56.220 --> 39:58.847
they don't all have to
happen in the real world.

39:58.871 --> 39:59.322
Oh...

39:59.323 --> 40:01.556
You see, you can keep
some of those things

40:01.558 --> 40:03.091
inside the head.
(elevator bell dings)

40:03.093 --> 40:04.259
You can?
You can.

40:04.261 --> 40:07.462
It's called an
inner life.

40:32.655 --> 40:35.223
Really?

40:35.225 --> 40:37.992
Rule 70, McGee?
