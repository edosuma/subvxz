00:00.940 --> 00:03.770
- Yes, i was calling about the stokke sleepi crib...
- Yeah, this is kevin walker from senator mccallister's office.

00:03.780 --> 00:06.460
- That--that has the-- the toddler bed
conversion kit. - Yes. Kevin walker.

00:06.470 --> 00:08.900
- Yeah, i was wondering if maybe you had that in cherry.
- Yes.

00:08.910 --> 00:10.610
- Yes.
- Thank you. Can you keep it down, please?

00:10.620 --> 00:12.920
Sorry, kevin, but this is
my home, not your office.

00:12.930 --> 00:13.880
Okay, thank you.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.300
You're gonna meet with the commercial
fishermen's union today at 4:00 p.m.

00:16.309 --> 00:18.580
You'll be talking to them about
your opposition to offshore drilling.

00:18.590 --> 00:21.630
- That's a good one.
- Oh, look. Why won't you listen to me?

00:21.640 --> 00:25.030
It won't have an impact for years, and
the environmental risks aren't worth it.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.940
Kevin, he's not listening.
Don't you see he's online?

00:27.950 --> 00:29.840
Don't you have a baby
carriage or something to buy?

00:29.870 --> 00:31.600
It's a crib, and i'm on hold.

00:31.620 --> 00:33.730
Look, i-i just got a
link online from my son.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.950
He wants me to take him to
the thanksgiving day parade.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.140
Your kids are coming to
thanksgiving? That's great.

00:38.150 --> 00:40.540
Mom's gonna love that.

00:42.980 --> 00:47.700
Uh, well, you know, the thing
is, kevin, is that, um...

00:48.240 --> 00:51.130
We're not gonna go to mom's
for thanksgiving this year.

00:51.140 --> 00:52.490
- That's impossible.
- Not really.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.710
Robert's uncle jack is coming
and all his cousins and the kids,

00:55.730 --> 00:59.040
And--and we're just gonna have
a thanksgiving dinner here.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.110
Why don't you just take them to mom's?

01:00.120 --> 01:04.180
It's just not that easy.We really want
to spend some time with sophie and jack,

01:04.200 --> 01:06.540
and, you know, talk about the adoption.

01:06.560 --> 01:10.720
Can't you just wait a couple weeks?I
mean, it's not as if you're showing.

01:11.530 --> 01:14.120
Okay, robert, robert,do you think
That maybe you could say something?

01:14.130 --> 01:15.870
Uh,your mom can't get us every year.

01:15.880 --> 01:18.090
Look,i know that. It's just...

01:18.570 --> 01:20.350
I'm not going either.

01:20.370 --> 01:21.350
- You're joking.
- No,i'm not.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.390
Look,scotty and i
were just married,okay?

01:23.410 --> 01:26.130
And he spends every thanksgiving
with his friends in palm springs.

01:26.140 --> 01:28.570
Well--well, is
mom okay with that?

01:28.600 --> 01:31.470
Sh--uh,she's...

01:31.800 --> 01:33.320
I haven't told her yet.

01:33.330 --> 01:36.010
Well,how does she feel
about you being here?

01:37.040 --> 01:39.860
Well,no,i-i-i haven't
told her yet,either.

01:39.870 --> 01:41.540
- Well,what are you waiting for?
- Well,what areyouwaiting for?

01:41.550 --> 01:43.010
- I think i ask you first.
- No,i askedyoufirst!

01:43.020 --> 01:45.060
- All right,look.
- Waiter.

01:45.070 --> 01:46.980
you're mom's gonna have
the whole family with her.

01:46.990 --> 01:50.150
It's not like she's gonna
be left all alone,right?

01:51.290 --> 01:52.550
- Yeah.
- We'll be okay.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.630
- We'll be fine.
- We're cool.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.610
Yeah.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.620
- We better call justin.
- Yeah.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.330
All right,what's wrong?
Why are you calling me here?

02:03.340 --> 02:05.690
- What's that noise?
- Hold on.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.110
Damn on
and off sw--

02:08.120 --> 02:09.360
okay.What's the deal?

02:09.370 --> 02:11.990
You--you're gonna go to
mom's for thanksgiving,right?

02:12.010 --> 02:13.960
- Uh,thanksgiving.
- Yeah,thanksgiving.

02:13.970 --> 02:16.660
I'm sure you've heard of it. It's
the holiday with pilgrims and turkeys.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.800
Wait. What--what
do they want?

02:17.810 --> 02:19.750
Did you tell them that we're not
going to mom's for thanksgiving?

02:19.760 --> 02:21.120
No.

02:21.130 --> 02:23.540
- I heard that!
- Uh,fine.

02:23.550 --> 02:26.250
We're,uh, we're not going to
mom's for thanksgiving this year.

02:26.260 --> 02:27.610
- You have to!
- Oh,that's impossible, justin!

02:27.620 --> 02:29.930
Don't let them pressure you.

02:31.090 --> 02:34.280
Okay,look,uh, rebecca's been getting
really close to her mom this year,

02:34.310 --> 02:38.610
And she wants to go up to the
winery, and as her boyfriend,i,uh...

02:38.620 --> 02:39.740
I'm gonna go,too.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.980
Justin,let me tell you something.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.100
Kevin and i are going away with our
husbands, and husbands trump boyfriends.

02:45.110 --> 02:46.890
Wait a second. You're not going,either?

02:46.900 --> 02:48.230
Oh,it's a freakin' nightmare.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.490
Do not fold,justin.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.930
All right,look, i may not be married.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.890
But you know what i'm doing right now?

02:53.910 --> 02:57.420
I'm vacuuming rebecca's
floor. Yeah. I'm deep in this.

02:57.430 --> 03:01.190
We're a couple,and i'm sorry, but this
year, it's about rebecca and her mom.

03:01.220 --> 03:03.480
- End of discussion.
- Yes.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.020
You haven't told mom yet, have you?

03:08.030 --> 03:10.820
It depends what you mean by "told."

03:12.320 --> 03:14.380
Okay,so i just got off
the phone with my mother.

03:14.420 --> 03:18.810
Her physical therapist says she has to stay
completely off her knee for at leastwo more weeks.

03:18.830 --> 03:21.500
It's gonna be one long mother marathon.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.030
It's okay.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.020
You're being so understanding.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.720
Well,i'd rather spend the weekend
with your disapproving parents

03:27.750 --> 03:30.870
Than spend another holiday with
my equally disapproving brother.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.700
I thought your feud with kevin was over.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.000
You guys seem fine.

03:34.010 --> 03:36.010
Yeah,it's because we've been faking it.

03:36.030 --> 03:38.160
Well,i hope you don't regret this.

03:38.170 --> 03:40.390
My mother's a terrible patient.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.990
And i'm kind of worried about elizabeth.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.440
She's been really cranky lately.
I think she had a fever last night.

03:45.450 --> 03:48.000
Oh,get that. I'm gonna
go check on elizabeth.

03:49.070 --> 03:50.000
- Hello?
- It's kitty.

03:50.010 --> 03:51.450
- And kevin.
- And me,bro.

03:51.460 --> 03:54.200
Oh,god. Why do i feel
like this is bad news?

03:54.210 --> 03:57.120
- Okay,here's the deal-- - we're
not going to thanksgiving this year.

03:57.130 --> 03:58.430
Who's "we"?

03:58.440 --> 04:00.780
All of us, and nobody's told mom yet.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.860
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- What's going on?

04:02.870 --> 04:07.050
Everybody picked thisthanksgiving
not to go, and nobody's told mom.

04:07.060 --> 04:08.970
Look,she's gonna
freak out. Maybe--

04:08.980 --> 04:10.870
tommy walker!No!

04:10.880 --> 04:12.960
But you said your mom was
gonna be in bed the whole time.

04:12.980 --> 04:15.630
- She might not even miss us.
- Give me that.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.550
All right,listen up,walkers.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.350
In all the years i have
been married to your brother,

04:19.360 --> 04:21.890
We havenevergone to my
parents' for thanksgiving.

04:21.899 --> 04:23.040
This time,we are.

04:23.060 --> 04:25.580
Everybody needs to get with
the program. You're adults.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.020
Stop worrying about your mother.

04:27.050 --> 04:29.570
Go over there and tell her the truth.

04:30.230 --> 04:33.500
Well,uh, there you have it.

04:33.510 --> 04:35.410
You haven't told mom
yet either,have you?

04:35.430 --> 04:37.890
No. We thought we were
the only ones not going.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.190
Well,we all did.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.230
Look,why don't we all tell her together?

04:41.250 --> 04:43.730
- Oh,that's a great idea. Safety in numbers.
- Yeah.

04:43.740 --> 04:46.790
Has,uh, anyone talked to sarah?

04:47.630 --> 04:49.670
You're all dead to me.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.750
Come on! This--nobody
did this on purpose.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.780
- Right,yeah.
- Yeah,it's not like we planned this.

04:53.790 --> 04:57.420
Joe's got my kids,saul's gone
to grandma's for thanksgiving,

04:57.430 --> 05:03.520
And you've all just simultaneously decided to form
your own little satellite states like a balkan uprising,

05:03.530 --> 05:07.540
And my neighbor flies to texas,
leaving me with his geriatric cat.

05:07.560 --> 05:11.960
Now you just expect me to
believe that's... Acoincidence?

05:11.970 --> 05:14.820
- Yeah. - I--i'm
not gonna do it.

05:14.830 --> 05:19.460
I'm depressed enough as it is, not having
my kids for the first thanksgiving...

05:19.470 --> 05:23.050
Mom alone, and a 30-pound turkey
will just send me over the edge.

05:23.060 --> 05:25.460
Mnh-mnh,i am going somewhere,too.

05:25.470 --> 05:26.510
- Where?
- Yeah.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.350
Somewhere.

05:27.380 --> 05:29.440
Sarah,i--i'm sorry,
but you can't.

05:29.460 --> 05:32.270
- You want to make a bet?
- What about mr. Fluffy?

05:32.610 --> 05:33.870
Right.

05:35.490 --> 05:37.690
Oh,god. I can't believe it.

05:37.700 --> 05:41.230
I'm having thanksgiving alone
with my mother and a decrepit cat.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.620
Okay,here's
the deal--

05:42.630 --> 05:46.080
- whoever draws the short stick has to tell mom,all right?
- No,no,no,no,no. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

05:46.090 --> 05:48.740
- I'm not doing the stick thing.
- Ladies first.

05:54.400 --> 05:58.200
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I knew
it! I knew it! It's not fair! It's not fair!

05:58.210 --> 06:00.340
- You always cheat.
- I'm outta here.

06:00.350 --> 06:02.320
- Oh,where are you going?
- Sarah,you're the buffer.

06:02.330 --> 06:03.220
- Sarah.
- Sarah.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.150
Look,you gotta put a
good face on this,right?

06:05.170 --> 06:06.940
Just--just act
like this'll be fun.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.810
You know,it's you and mom hanging
out on thanksgiving, you know,

06:09.830 --> 06:12.450
A couple single girls,
ladies' night,you know?

06:12.460 --> 06:14.830
That way,she won't freak out on us.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.900
I hope you all get salmonella and die.

06:21.690 --> 06:24.630
- Looks like,uh, sarah could use a friend.
- Oh,no!

06:24.640 --> 06:26.780
No,no,no,justin, you
can't--oh,that's not--

06:26.790 --> 06:28.450
Kevin! This is ridiculous!

06:28.460 --> 06:30.290
- Well,aren't you cowards?
- You and mom,a one-on-one.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.160
What ever happened to safety in numbers?

06:32.170 --> 06:33.890
You guys,come on,you can't do this...

06:33.900 --> 06:37.840
She's here! She's here!
She's here! She's here!

06:42.340 --> 06:44.460
Sarah?

06:44.840 --> 06:46.800
The recipe is...

06:46.810 --> 06:48.500
- Mom's here.
- Hey,mom.

06:48.510 --> 06:50.630
You're all here.
Well,that's really great...

06:50.640 --> 06:54.810
Because i've got a carload full of
groceries you can help me bring in--

06:54.820 --> 06:59.170
Pumpkins,cranberries,yams and...

06:59.640 --> 07:01.950
Will you look at this turkey?

07:01.970 --> 07:05.000
I had to go to three stores
before i could find one...

07:05.010 --> 07:07.180
Big enough for our entire
group. Oh,look at that!

07:07.190 --> 07:11.030
You know what? We--we--we didn't realize
you were gonna do all the shopping tonight.

07:11.860 --> 07:15.120
Well,i was busy today, and it's
much less crowded in the evening,

07:15.140 --> 07:19.500
And if--you can't wait till the last
minute because the birds get all picked...

07:19.510 --> 07:21.850
Oh,what's wrong?

07:23.190 --> 07:25.480
- Kitty. -
Okay,we've--we've-- we--

07:25.490 --> 07:28.690
we've all decided to go
away for thanksgiving.

07:28.700 --> 07:29.960
Uh,separately.

07:29.980 --> 07:34.850
It's actually kind of funny
if you--if you think about it.

07:35.390 --> 07:38.220
- All of you? - Oh,well,no.
No,no. No. Not--not sarah.

07:38.230 --> 07:40.190
Yeah,no-- yeah,she'll be
here-- be here with you.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.490
it's a horrible coincidence,mom.

07:42.510 --> 07:46.750
So poor sarah got stuck staying with
me. What,did you lose a bet or something?

07:47.890 --> 07:50.370
No. No,mom.

07:50.380 --> 07:53.610
Actually,to be perfectly frank,
i'm looking forward to it.

07:53.620 --> 07:55.820
I mean,two single girls...

07:55.830 --> 07:59.200
We'll baste,we'll roast, hang
out by the fire, drink red wine--

07:59.220 --> 08:00.770
- it'll be fun.
- That is so sweet.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.690
Oh,sarah,please don't patronize me.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.660
I--i'll be just fine
without you holding my hand.

08:05.670 --> 08:08.220
I'm just going out in the car to get
the rest of the useless groceries.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.480
Oh,look,wait up,mom. Let me help.

08:09.490 --> 08:12.290
Honestly,sarah,thank you very
much. I don't need your help.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.530
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.200
I'm gonna dump it all in the trash.

08:15.210 --> 08:16.970
You know,she didn't--
she didn't mean that.

08:16.980 --> 08:18.760
Yeah,i mean,you know,
it was aimed at us,too.

08:18.770 --> 08:22.380
No,kevin. Thisis aimed at you.

08:22.390 --> 08:25.840
- And that's aimed at you! And that one at you!
- That's good!

08:25.850 --> 08:27.410
No! No,sarah! Sarah,no.

08:27.420 --> 08:31.320
No,i bruise--i bruise
easily. Remember? Sarah,no!

08:38.130 --> 08:40.350
Tommy! Tommy!

08:40.360 --> 08:41.640
- Yeah?
- Tommy,come here.

08:41.650 --> 08:42.530
Yeah. What's wrong?

08:42.539 --> 08:45.870
She threw up, and there's
blood in it. She's so pale.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.170
We have to take her
to e.r.,okay? Let's go.

08:48.180 --> 08:50.600
- Come on, let's go right now.
- All right,all right.

08:59.500 --> 09:03.250
She's still running a fever and her
liver function tests are elevated.

09:03.260 --> 09:05.690
What do you mean? What--
what happened to her liver?

09:05.700 --> 09:07.520
There's been some cellular dtruction.

09:07.530 --> 09:09.200
It's probably chemical in origin.

09:09.220 --> 09:14.340
Since elizabeth was bo prematurely, we administered
heavy doses of multiple drugs at the time.

09:14.350 --> 09:17.280
Any one of those could've
caused liver damage.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.590
So... What's the next step?

09:19.600 --> 09:23.770
What we're hoping is that enough cells
remain viable and the liver can regenerate.

09:23.790 --> 09:26.540
We'll keep monitoring her
functions and see what happens.

09:26.550 --> 09:29.110
Please,we just need you
to be honest with us.

09:29.130 --> 09:32.270
I need to know what we're facing.

09:32.580 --> 09:36.940
If her liver fails,she's
going to need a transplant.

09:36.950 --> 09:38.580
Oh,god.

09:38.590 --> 09:41.990
But pediatric liver transplants
are extremely successful.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.890
We can take a slice of either your liver or
your husband's, and it will grow in her body.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.280
Now elizabeth's blood type is
"o," so we'll test you both.

09:50.300 --> 09:53.340
One of you has to match.

09:56.810 --> 10:01.490
Okay. Uh,well,we'll--we'll cross
that bridge when we get to it.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.120
Tommy.

10:07.370 --> 10:11.660
I'm not,um... I'm not
her biological father.

10:11.670 --> 10:14.140
- We had sperm donated.
- I see.

10:14.150 --> 10:17.420
One of my brothers is the donor.

10:17.740 --> 10:21.130
We just don't... We don't which one.

10:21.140 --> 10:25.120
Well... I think we better find out.

10:31.990 --> 10:33.250
I think i have blisters.

10:33.260 --> 10:37.130
Yore the one who wanted to lose 5 pounds
so you could gain it back for thanksgiving.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.930
How far did we run?

10:38.950 --> 10:40.560
- Two miles.
- Two miles?

10:40.570 --> 10:42.550
- That's it,two miles?
- Yeah.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.990
That felt like 22.

10:48.710 --> 10:49.960
Ah,it's tommy.

10:49.970 --> 10:51.540
He fired you months ago. Get over it.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.650
How would you like it if
your own brother fired you?

10:53.660 --> 10:56.080
I don't have a brother.
Stop being so childish.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.990
Youstop being so childish.

11:06.340 --> 11:08.980
If you guys don't take some of this
food, it's all gonna go to waste.

11:09.000 --> 11:09.970
How about some onions?

11:09.980 --> 11:12.390
Mom,holly already has all this stuff.

11:12.410 --> 11:15.150
Well,how about a turkey? Does she have
a turkey? Tell her it's a gift from me.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.680
Mom,mom,she doesn't
want your used turkey.

11:17.690 --> 11:20.160
It's not used. It's
brand-new. It has no cooties.

11:20.170 --> 11:23.030
It's more about the
psychological cooties.

11:25.990 --> 11:27.390
Oh,it's tommy.Hey,bro.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.670
You know,where is tommy and julia?

11:28.680 --> 11:30.300
- They were supposed to come over this morning and take some of this stuff.
- Mom says hi.

11:30.310 --> 11:32.920
- How close is mom to you right now? And don't be obvious.
- I've got a ton of green beans over there.

11:32.930 --> 11:36.680
Two,uh,two big pumpkins and a turkey.

11:36.690 --> 11:38.950
Don't react. I need you to
casually go to the pantry.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.700
There's,uh,something i need to tell you.

11:41.710 --> 11:45.870
Okay. Uh,but why would
i need to go in there?

11:45.880 --> 11:48.710
Forget it. Just make up some
excuse as to why you need to leave

11:48.720 --> 11:51.430
and come here to the st.Francis
hospital as soon as you can,all right?

11:51.440 --> 11:53.520
Whoa,why you at the hospital?

11:53.530 --> 11:54.960
- Why is tommy at the hospital?
- Justin!

11:54.970 --> 11:56.410
- I said don't
react. - Mom,i--mom!

11:56.420 --> 11:59.220
- Tommy,are you hurt?
- I'm fine! It's nothing.

11:59.230 --> 12:00.900
Look,i need to talk to justin.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.520
Why? Is there something wrong with you?

12:02.530 --> 12:04.170
I-i don't think so.

12:04.190 --> 12:07.000
- Wait,is there something wrong with me?
- No!

12:07.620 --> 12:09.570
Look,it's elizabeth, but she's fine now.

12:09.580 --> 12:12.080
They're... They're doing some tests.

12:12.090 --> 12:12.750
Oh,my god.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.790
- Listen,justin...
- Okay,um...

12:14.800 --> 12:16.960
I need onlyyou to come
to the hospital,okay?

12:16.970 --> 12:18.370
Mom,mom,he just
wants me, okay?Mom--

12:18.380 --> 12:21.460
tommy,honey,we're on
our way. Don't worry.

12:22.180 --> 12:24.260
Sorry,tommy.

12:25.150 --> 12:28.380
We just want to find out ahead of time,uh,
which one of you will be the donor.

12:28.390 --> 12:32.090
We're just trying to be prepared if it turns
out that she has to have the transplant.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.540
Of course. Anything you need from us.

12:33.550 --> 12:36.000
W--i don't understand. Why
does it need to be one of them?

12:36.010 --> 12:37.440
I thought it was a blood type issue.

12:37.460 --> 12:39.870
It is,but julia and i
are-- are not a match.

12:39.890 --> 12:41.840
Well,test all of us, don't you think?

12:41.850 --> 12:45.180
Because either kevin or-- or
justin have to be type "o."

12:45.200 --> 12:46.510
That's what i am. I'm a type "o."

12:46.520 --> 12:50.670
- I-i'm,uh... I'm type
"o," tommy. - Me,too.

12:51.490 --> 12:54.010
- Wait,you're both type "o"?
- Yeah.

12:54.020 --> 12:57.160
Well,i called it first...so i-i really
think that i should be the one to--

12:57.170 --> 12:59.810
mom,it's--it's
not that simple.

12:59.830 --> 13:01.840
Why not?

13:02.300 --> 13:06.860
Because liver transplants work
out better with the parent.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.780
- Let's get a coffee.
- Yeah.

13:30.670 --> 13:32.400
Come in.

13:32.410 --> 13:34.690
Just have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

13:34.700 --> 13:36.420
Thank you.

13:43.050 --> 13:45.300
- This is good.
- What?

13:45.580 --> 13:49.550
That they're gonna find out
who... Who'll be able to help.

13:49.950 --> 13:52.070
Yeah.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.970
Uh,will it...

13:54.990 --> 13:57.980
Will it bother you to
know who's able to help?

13:57.990 --> 13:59.190
Not really.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.320
Yeah,me neither.

14:02.230 --> 14:04.610
You think it'll bother tommy?

14:05.110 --> 14:07.270
It's not like he doesn't
know it's either you or me.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.300
Yeah,that's true.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.660
Pretty sure he wants it to be me,though.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.620
Truly delusional.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.250
Well,i mean,kevin, let's face it.

14:16.260 --> 14:19.350
I have better hair, and
your nose on a girl? Tragic.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.430
Do you wanna talk
s.a.t.scores,pretty boy?

14:21.440 --> 14:24.200
- Okay,mr. Walker.
- Yeah.

14:25.750 --> 14:28.230
- You're both getting genetic testing?
- Yeah.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.400
How long will it be for
us to get the results?

14:30.410 --> 14:33.580
Depends on how busy the lab
is. Probably a few hours.

14:33.590 --> 14:35.080
If you're in a hurry,
i can put a rush on it.

14:35.090 --> 14:35.670
- No!
- No.

14:35.870 --> 14:38.270
Yeah,take your time. I mean,this
is--this is pretty much precautionary.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.980
We--we probably won't
even need 'em at all.

14:39.990 --> 14:42.680
Yeah,if--if things go
the way we hope they will,

14:42.690 --> 14:45.160
- this'll all be moot.
- Moot.

14:45.170 --> 14:46.340
- Moot?
- Yeah.

14:46.350 --> 14:47.970
Right.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.990
They've been in there for over an hour.

14:51.000 --> 14:51.730
No. No,thanks.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.160
Oh,for god sake,mom. Would you sit down?

14:53.170 --> 14:57.070
As much as you'd like to worry,
everything's gonna be all right.

14:57.210 --> 14:59.540
God,i wish i could do this myself.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.270
Well,you can't. You're not her mother.

15:01.280 --> 15:05.430
You're her grandmother, and therefore you
have a much older and less desirable liver.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.960
There,i said it.

15:06.970 --> 15:09.250
Yes,you certainly did.

15:12.760 --> 15:16.340
I wonder what kevin and justin
are talking about right now.

15:16.370 --> 15:19.600
- I mean,they're--they're about to
find out who-- - who the father is.

15:19.610 --> 15:22.540
No,tommyis elizabeth's father,sarah.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.410
- You know what i mean.
- No,i don't know what you mean,sarah.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.000
I'm sorry,but words matter.

15:26.010 --> 15:28.550
- Well,i don't know what to call them--sperm
donors? - Well,i--well,okay,fine. All right,fine.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.490
- I don't think about my brothers' sperm.
- I guess i'm just...

15:31.500 --> 15:34.950
- A little overly sensitive to the whole nature versus nurture thing.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.380
no,honestly,guys,stop.
You're both right.

15:38.390 --> 15:41.280
I mean,we have to try to be sensitive
to what tommy is going through.

15:41.290 --> 15:42.900
Knowing tommy,it's a lot.

15:42.910 --> 15:46.100
I mean,he's always seen this
as his own personal failure.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.410
I know.
He has--

15:47.420 --> 15:49.100
What's going on?

15:49.110 --> 15:50.640
Not much. What's happening?

15:50.650 --> 15:51.660
Is everything all right?

15:51.670 --> 15:52.780
Everything's fine.

15:52.790 --> 15:57.270
Uh,justin and kevin are just finishing
up, so there's nothing left to do but wait.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.200
We're just seeing if--if she's
gonna get better on her own.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.760
So i think it'd best if you
guys went home and relaxed.

16:02.770 --> 16:04.630
And if there's any news,
i'll--i'll call you.

16:04.650 --> 16:07.180
No,i re--i really wanna
stay here for--for julia.

16:07.210 --> 16:08.510
Her family's not here.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.720
Mom,julia is fine.

16:10.730 --> 16:13.640
Besides,we might need
you to be strong later.

16:13.650 --> 16:16.510
So sitting here all day
and night isn't gonna help.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.300
Kitty,sarah.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.270
Tommy,elizabeth is
going to be just fine.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.030
I'm sure of it.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.810
- I know,mom. I know.
- Let's go.

16:25.820 --> 16:27.030
All right. I'm going.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.600
- No,i-- - you don't
have to pull me.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.010
You must be freaking out.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.880
Mm,not really. This is about elizabeth.

16:34.890 --> 16:39.080
You know,which sperm cell got there
fastest years ago isn't that important.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.870
Unless it was yours.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.780
You know what? So what. I have a
little surgery. You know,no big deal.

16:44.790 --> 16:46.810
I've been shot at,remember?

16:46.830 --> 16:50.000
I mean,on a scale of one to
ten, this surgery's like a one.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.710
And if you're the father,
it's what,like a two?

16:52.720 --> 16:56.790
She has a father. His name
is tommy. Heraises her.

16:57.660 --> 16:59.370
I know,but...

16:59.390 --> 17:04.310
I mean, i wasn't raised by my father, and i
spent my whole life obsessing over who he was.

17:04.319 --> 17:07.390
I just don't want you to feel like
you need to pretend it--it's...

17:07.400 --> 17:09.890
It doesn't matter,you know?

17:09.900 --> 17:14.290
I mean,look, even if i'm living in some
crazy denial world, like,i'm okay with it.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.740
I mean,being a father is the
most important thing to tommy,

17:16.760 --> 17:19.940
And i don't want to think or--or feel
anything to get in the way of that.

17:19.980 --> 17:23.280
I know,and that's great, and
you've been amazing. I just...

17:23.290 --> 17:27.880
I hope that you understand that once this gets
out of the bottle, you can't put it back in.

17:27.900 --> 17:32.190
Let's not get ahead of ourselves,all righ i mean,elizabeth
still might be able to get better on her own.

17:33.290 --> 17:36.620
Let's just hope we don't
have to let this out,you know?

17:37.720 --> 17:39.410
Yeah,we're all out in the backyard.

17:39.420 --> 17:41.120
The--the kids were
asking where you were.

17:41.130 --> 17:44.450
Maybe you shouldn't tell them. I
don't want them to worry or anything.

17:44.460 --> 17:47.620
Okay. How are you?

17:48.250 --> 17:51.190
Yeah. Yeah. You know,
i'm--i'm okay. I'm okay. I'm...

17:51.200 --> 17:54.060
I don't know. I'm actually
feeling a little weird.

17:54.070 --> 17:57.590
I think this whole thing
is--is pushing buttons in me.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.960
Yeah,well,i guess it'd
be weird if it didn't.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.770
But i think everything'll be okay.

18:05.610 --> 18:09.050
Yeah. Yeah,i hope so. Everybody's here.

18:09.310 --> 18:14.080
Everybody's being so supportive.
It's--it's oddly nice.

18:14.090 --> 18:17.130
Kitty,i-i can't come there. I
ve a house full of relatives.

18:17.140 --> 18:18.560
Robert,it's fine. It's fine.

18:18.570 --> 18:21.240
I'm not telling you to make
you feel guilty.I'm just--

18:21.250 --> 18:24.630
i'm sorry. Look,will--will
you call me if you need me?

18:24.640 --> 18:27.090
I will. I'll talk to you later.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.020
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.590
I told you in my message you
didn't need to cut your trip short.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.050
We don't know anything yet.

18:36.060 --> 18:41.710
First of all,your mother couldn't drag herself away from
her dominoes tournament to even acknowledge my presence.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.650
I don't even think that
she noticed when i left.

18:43.660 --> 18:47.180
Second of all,i thought you
might need me more than she did.

18:50.030 --> 18:52.810
God. I always feel like i need
to take a shower after doing this.

18:52.820 --> 18:57.310
Well,i hate to break this to you,kiddo, but you
can get pumpkin pie filling in cans these days.

18:57.800 --> 19:02.580
I just don't want you to wear yourself out
cooking a meal that might not even get eaten.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.880
You know what?

19:03.900 --> 19:08.470
After elizabeth's tests come back and
they're normal and she doesn't need surgery,

19:08.490 --> 19:10.920
We're all going to be very
thankful... And hungry.

19:10.930 --> 19:14.580
And this is what hungry,
thankful happy families eat.

19:14.610 --> 19:16.330
And it's going to be ready.

19:16.340 --> 19:18.610
If you cook it, they will come?

19:18.620 --> 19:21.370
I cook it, and they'll forgive me.

19:21.380 --> 19:24.940
What,nora? What--what do you
think you need to be forgiven for?

19:25.620 --> 19:28.560
Oh,i don't know. I behaved badly.

19:28.570 --> 19:33.130
I got mad at everyone because they all
made their own plans for thanksgiving,

19:33.150 --> 19:37.920
And i just selshly wanted the whole
family together here, like always.

19:37.930 --> 19:43.660
And now everybody is here, and i just wish they were
all miles and miles away and safe and sound and...

19:43.670 --> 19:45.990
Healthy.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.720
Nora...You're a very powerful woman,

19:49.990 --> 19:52.820
but you didn't cause
this and you can't fix it.

19:52.830 --> 19:53.950
I feel so useless.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.630
I don't know what to do with myself.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.980
Oh,sweetheart.

19:57.990 --> 20:01.170
You know what to do.

20:01.180 --> 20:06.020
You do what you've always done--
you comfort them, you support them,

20:06.030 --> 20:08.430
You let them know how
much you love them.

20:08.450 --> 20:12.180
And then you bake a
pumpkin pie from scratch.

20:12.210 --> 20:17.890
Isn't it good that i came all the way from albuquerque
just to give you this invaluable advice,hmm?

20:18.930 --> 20:21.480
Yes.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.930
And now that you're here, we're
going to need one more pie.

20:24.940 --> 20:27.240
- So ihink you should scoop this.
- No,i don't scoop.

20:27.250 --> 20:30.550
- Yeah,yes, you do. You scoop.
- Oh,no,i don't!

20:30.560 --> 20:33.260
This hospital has the worst
food. I mean,it's not even food.

20:33.270 --> 20:35.750
It's some horrible facsimile of food.

20:35.770 --> 20:39.080
Don't be too hard on it. It may
be my last meal... Or justin's.

20:39.090 --> 20:40.990
- That's not funny,bro.
- No.

20:41.000 --> 20:47.100
there you are. Uh,listen, i just spoke to
the doctors, and,um, she needs the transplant.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.140
Oh,god. Tommy,are you okay?

20:49.150 --> 20:53.820
Yeah. I'm fine. Everything's fine.

20:55.860 --> 20:58.830
Kevin,it's you.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.210
Really?

21:02.220 --> 21:03.180
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:03.190 --> 21:07.430
Um,they wanna run some more tests, make sure
you've never had hepatitis,stuff like that.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.550
Yeah. Sure.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.430
C-congratulations.

21:12.870 --> 21:16.750
Look,he can pass out cigars
later. We--we gotta get to the lab.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.320
Sure.

21:18.330 --> 21:21.360
- I'll,uh, i'll see you later.
- Yeah.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.510
- You okay?
- No.

21:29.990 --> 21:32.480
Are you?

21:32.490 --> 21:35.030
No,not really.

21:37.950 --> 21:41.430
- You have any 4s?
- Nope. Go fish.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.550
I hate this game.

21:42.560 --> 21:46.400
Justin,what's a painting by
degas or a liqueur? Eight letters.

21:46.410 --> 21:48.670
Absinthe.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.440
Can't people know things?

21:52.080 --> 21:54.320
- You have any 7s?
- Yes.

21:54.330 --> 21:55.980
Here,you win. I quit.

21:55.990 --> 21:58.150
Why don't you two go home?

21:58.160 --> 22:01.000
I just wanna stay and make sure
everything's okay,all right?

22:01.710 --> 22:05.280
Um,i'm gonna go home and
get some stuff for kevin.

22:05.310 --> 22:07.250
Oh,no,no. Let me go. You stay here.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.680
Oh,no,you won't be
able to find anything.

22:08.690 --> 22:11.360
Well,i'll find it if
you tell me where it is.

22:11.380 --> 22:14.090
Uh,justin,why don't
you guys come with me?

22:14.110 --> 22:16.430
I just told you i wanna stay.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.640
- Well,just go out for a walk then.
- Yeah,justin, let's go for a walk.

22:18.650 --> 22:22.640
I don't want a walk,okay?
I want another bag of chips.

22:26.220 --> 22:29.080
- Well,thanks. I'll--i'll
make a list for you. - Okay.

22:32.840 --> 22:34.390
How many of those can you eat?

22:34.400 --> 22:37.320
Look,i don't know,mom. We'll see.

22:39.300 --> 22:42.360
I'm sorry. I just feel so bad for
elizabeth and what she's going through.

22:42.370 --> 22:44.400
Ma,she's not even 2 years old.

22:44.410 --> 22:47.950
I know. What are you
going through,justin?

22:47.960 --> 22:49.090
What--what are
you feeling?

22:49.100 --> 22:51.450
Are you--you
disappointed it's kevin?

22:51.460 --> 22:53.810
- Disappointed?
- No.

22:53.820 --> 22:56.630
- Are you relieved?
- No.

22:58.390 --> 23:00.460
Yes,i'm relieved and
yes,i'm disappointed.

23:00.470 --> 23:02.320
Ma,i-i don't know
what i'm feeling,okay?

23:02.340 --> 23:05.910
The only thing idoknow is
that it doesn't feel good.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.750
Oh,look,sarah. This room is lovely.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.470
I wouldn't know,ma. It's pretty
hard to see through the forest.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.950
Oh,well,honey, just
put it down over there.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.020
- Where's kevin?
- Right here.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.120
Hi,honey. How you doing?

23:27.130 --> 23:30.100
I'm fine. Well,i'm wearing
a dress with no backside.

23:30.110 --> 23:31.610
I've been better.

23:31.620 --> 23:34.030
Well,i brought everything
you wanted from home.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.830
- And then some.
- Yep.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.060
So let's see what we have here.

23:38.070 --> 23:39.360
- Your dop kit.
- Great.

23:39.370 --> 23:42.100
And... Your pajamas.

23:42.110 --> 23:45.390
Oh,nora. Those aren't his
pajamas. These are my pajamas.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.110
- I should've gone--
- scotty,it's okay.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.960
- I love your pajamas.
- Yeah?

23:50.820 --> 23:52.090
- Here's your ipod.
- Thank you.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.280
Oh,that's great. Now we can
listen to show tunes all night.

23:54.290 --> 23:56.040
Whatever kevin wants.

23:56.050 --> 23:57.870
Okay,i'm ordering chinese.

23:57.880 --> 23:58.900
I can't eat anything.

23:58.930 --> 24:02.380
I know. That's why i'm gonna order everything
with shrimp because you're allergic.

24:02.390 --> 24:03.890
- How thoughtful.
- I don't think i could eat a thing.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.310
- My smach is doing flip-flops. -
Yes,i'd like to place an order,lease.

24:06.320 --> 24:10.220
One shrimp lo mein,one
special fried rice with shrimp.

24:10.230 --> 24:11.940
- What do you want,justin?
- Uh,beef with broccoli.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.650
Two beef and broccoli with shrimp.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.420
Sarah,you don't have to
order everything with shrimp.

24:15.430 --> 24:18.210
- I'm not even hungry. No,that'll be a pickup.
- Thank you.

24:18.220 --> 24:19.660
When are they taking
you in in the morning?

24:19.670 --> 24:22.830
Ugh,some awful hour like 5:00.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.620
Kevin,i think what you're
doing is incredible.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.140
I don't think i would be so brave.

24:26.150 --> 24:27.740
Well,you're not a morning person,honey.

24:27.760 --> 24:30.540
No,kevin. You're being amazing.

24:30.550 --> 24:31.950
I am amazing.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.110
Hi,tommy.

24:36.090 --> 24:38.160
Hey,tommy. You hungry?
I just ordered chinese.

24:38.170 --> 24:42.040
You can have,uh,shrimp,
shrimp or shrimp.

24:42.410 --> 24:45.480
Well,you must be happy,mom.

24:45.490 --> 24:47.300
Why on earth would i be happy?

24:47.320 --> 24:52.200
Everybody's here, together for
thanksgiving, just the way you wanted it.

24:54.590 --> 24:56.370
Tommy,that's not fair.

24:56.380 --> 24:59.540
Well,then stop treating this
like one of your dinner parties.

24:59.550 --> 25:03.170
I mean,this isn't another
walker family get-together.

25:03.180 --> 25:05.430
Tommy,that's not what we're doing.

25:05.450 --> 25:08.900
Just enjoy your dinner.

25:40.090 --> 25:43.370
I hope this works.

25:43.380 --> 25:48.390
It will. It has to.

26:16.250 --> 26:18.280
Are you asleep?

26:18.300 --> 26:21.150
- No. Are you?
- No.

26:26.800 --> 26:30.820
Wow,you look like you're in the
first-class cabin of swish air.

26:30.830 --> 26:34.210
Seeing as i'm awake, i might as
well sign some of these forms.

26:34.220 --> 26:36.890
Can you pass me that pen, please?

26:37.380 --> 26:39.570
- Thank you.
- What are they for?

26:39.580 --> 26:42.660
Everything. This one's
authorization of payment.

26:42.670 --> 26:45.490
Payment? You're giving them a piece
of your liver. Isn't that enough?

26:45.500 --> 26:49.350
Oh,no. No good deed goes unpunished.

26:49.360 --> 26:54.610
Informed consent. They wanna make sure i'm
aware of all the risks involved, which include...

26:54.870 --> 26:57.580
"loss of limb function,paralysis,
stroke,brain damage, hemorrhage"--

26:57.590 --> 26:59.800
okay,good. Thank you. Moving on.

26:59.810 --> 27:02.360
Hopefully i'll just end up
with a scar and nothing else.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.330
Well,i like scars. I think they're sexy.

27:04.340 --> 27:06.650
- This one needs to be notarized.
- Notarized? What is it?

27:06.660 --> 27:08.520
Power of attorney.

27:08.530 --> 27:09.440
Well,you're an attorney.

27:09.450 --> 27:14.130
Not if i'm on life support, and as my husband,
you'd be in charge of pulling the plug or not.

27:16.980 --> 27:20.840
Okay,this is all starting to
get a little too,um... Real.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.120
Yeah,i might sign that
one in the morning.

27:27.150 --> 27:28.930
It's a good thing wearemarried.

27:28.950 --> 27:32.410
If it was up to my mother, she'd never pull the
plug, and i'd be a vegetable for all eternity.

27:32.430 --> 27:34.210
- It's not funny,kevin.
- I know it's not funny.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.860
But please don't get serious on me now.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.760
We have the whole
operation to get through.

27:38.770 --> 27:43.420
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm scared.

27:44.690 --> 27:48.480
I know. Come here.

27:54.460 --> 27:57.850
everything is gonna
be fine. I promise you.

27:59.590 --> 28:02.110
i know.

28:05.790 --> 28:08.010
come here.

28:20.660 --> 28:22.420
what time is it?

28:22.430 --> 28:25.530
It's really early. You should
probably go back to bed.

28:25.540 --> 28:27.880
Mm,i'm up already.

28:27.890 --> 28:29.190
Want some breakfast?

28:29.200 --> 28:32.030
Uh,no. I'm not really
hungry, but thanks.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.270
And thank you for letting me sleep over.

28:34.280 --> 28:38.960
Rebecca,it's your
house,too. It always will be.

28:39.980 --> 28:42.510
Oh,my god. I had crazy dreams all night.

28:42.520 --> 28:45.860
You were in one, justin was in one, and
there were babies all over the place.

28:45.890 --> 28:49.210
Mm,probably everything got stirred
up from being at the hospital.

28:49.230 --> 28:51.680
Yeah.

28:53.020 --> 28:55.800
You know,i was thinking,
maybe i should call him.

28:55.820 --> 28:59.200
- Who? Justin?
- No. David.

29:00.880 --> 29:04.330
- Well,he's my dad.
- I know who you meant.

29:07.580 --> 29:11.200
How do you do it? How do you just
pretend like he doesn't exist?

29:11.210 --> 29:15.030
I know he exists. I'm just
glad he doesn't exist here.

29:15.040 --> 29:18.310
Yeah,but he left because of me,
because i wanted to still be a walker.

29:18.320 --> 29:21.420
Yeah,that's one reason he left.

29:21.430 --> 29:23.190
Why are you so cynical about him?

29:23.200 --> 29:27.120
Because he would've found
another reason to go.

29:27.130 --> 29:29.900
That is just his m.o.,becca.

29:29.910 --> 29:35.690
I have known him for 25 years, and he can't be
in one place and he can't be with one person.

29:42.200 --> 29:47.840
i know that this has
opened up a lot of wounds.

29:47.850 --> 29:51.090
But he is not the one to fix it.

29:51.120 --> 29:53.610
He can't.

29:53.620 --> 29:58.570
Sweetie,i'm sorry, but he
would only let you down.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.080
Oh,i can't believe this is happening.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.210
I should bhome making
stuffing for the turkey,

30:24.220 --> 30:27.680
not waiting for my son and my
grandbaby to go into surgery.

30:27.690 --> 30:29.400
Nora,come on. We're lucky
they're having surgery.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.200
It's only gonna save elizabeth's life.

30:31.220 --> 30:34.200
Oh,i know,i know. Look,look, when they roll
kevin out, let's just give him some room.

30:34.210 --> 30:36.330
We don't want to scare him.

30:36.340 --> 30:37.660
- Oh,here he is.
- Okay.

30:37.670 --> 30:38.970
Oh,here he is.

30:38.980 --> 30:40.450
Is--is he
under yet?

30:40.460 --> 30:42.380
He's on a drip. He's high as a kite.

30:42.390 --> 30:44.480
There he is. Here he is.

30:44.490 --> 30:49.010
Oh,the whole family is
here. That's so nice.

30:49.020 --> 30:52.080
Sweetie,it's gonna be over
before you know it. Just relax.

30:52.090 --> 30:54.790
Mom,they shaved my chest.
I look like michael phelps.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.800
Oh,i think he's pretty relaxed.

30:56.810 --> 30:58.930
Honey,i'm gonna be the first person
you see when you wake up,okay?

30:58.940 --> 31:01.540
Okay. Just tell 'em to
take a little off the sides.

31:01.550 --> 31:04.220
Whatever you want.

31:05.920 --> 31:09.510
- Okay,good luck.
- Bye.

31:24.780 --> 31:26.580
Julia asked me to bring you that.

31:26.590 --> 31:29.920
Yeah,did she,uh, tell
you to bring me a decaf?

31:29.930 --> 31:32.830
- Uh,yeah.
- Trade me?

31:36.430 --> 31:39.410
I just--i couldn't sit
in that room anymore.

31:39.430 --> 31:44.400
I mean,if one more person asked me how i was
feeling, i thought my head was gonna explode.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.770
No. No.

31:48.940 --> 31:53.910
So at the risk of a-- of an
explosion, how... How are you feeling?

31:53.920 --> 31:56.230
I'm fine.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.320
What,kitty? What? What
do you want me to say?

32:00.330 --> 32:02.050
The doctor's say it's
all gonna work out,so--

32:02.060 --> 32:05.650
Well,i'm sure it will,tommy, but
that doesn't mean you're fine.

32:05.670 --> 32:07.940
Y-you don't have to hide
your feelings from me.

32:07.950 --> 32:11.570
I probably understand a lot
more than you think i do.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.990
I doubt it.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.020
Okay,well,let me take a wild guess.

32:17.040 --> 32:21.340
What you can't talk about is the fact that
you're angry because for some inexplicable reason,

32:21.360 --> 32:23.520
Kevin can father a child and you can't.

32:23.540 --> 32:27.070
And now after everything you've
been through with elizabeth,

32:27.080 --> 32:31.440
The one thing that she needs the most,
you can't give her, but kevin can.

32:31.450 --> 32:35.690
And what really sucks is that deep
down, you--you resent him for it.

32:35.710 --> 32:40.890
And what makes it even worse is that
even deeper down, you're sick of this--

32:40.910 --> 32:44.080
This,uh,grudge that you
guys are carrying on,

32:44.090 --> 32:47.410
and you really, really
miss your brother.

32:47.420 --> 32:50.780
You know,tommy,i really
wanted to be pregnant.

32:50.800 --> 32:54.400
And i would--i would think-- i would think,
well,h-how do people like trish just go out,

32:54.420 --> 32:58.000
They don't even want kids, they have a
one-night stand, and e's immediately pregnant.

32:58.020 --> 33:02.980
And of course i'm, you know,i'm very grateful
that she's bringing our baby into the world,

33:02.990 --> 33:06.920
Just as you're grateful to
kevin,but it-- it's just that--

33:06.930 --> 33:12.070
That little part of you
that--that thinks it's not fair.

33:17.130 --> 33:19.180
Maybe you do understand.

33:19.190 --> 33:21.190
Eh,just,you know...

33:21.200 --> 33:24.380
Yeah,but,uh,you won't-- you
won't say anything, will you?

33:24.400 --> 33:27.460
- Oh,i won't if you won't.
- Good.

33:27.470 --> 33:32.120
Tommy,it's over. She's
in recovery. Kevin,too.

33:32.130 --> 33:33.210
What did the doctor say?

33:33.220 --> 33:35.680
She said it went fine.
That's all she said--fine.

33:35.690 --> 33:40.630
We'll know more in two days, but she's,um,
gonna wake up soon, and we can see her.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.640
Fine is good,right?

33:42.650 --> 33:45.640
Fi-fine is very good.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.720
Oh,god. The doctor told
me about the good news.

33:57.730 --> 34:00.450
Yeah,she said her test
results look really good.

34:00.480 --> 34:05.020
No sign of organ rejection so far, and they
upgraded her condition from fair to good.

34:05.040 --> 34:10.600
I knew she'd be all right. I
just knew it. But i'm so relieved.

34:12.929 --> 34:17.489
Oh,honey. Look at her--her
color is so much better.

34:17.500 --> 34:18.130
- Yeah.
- I know.

34:18.139 --> 34:22.480
Julia gave her some juice earlier, and they're
gonna start her on solid foods tomorrow.

34:22.500 --> 34:25.550
And when do you two start on solid
foods? I mean,you're disappearing.

34:25.560 --> 34:28.120
Yeah,it's the sick baby
diet. Works like a charm.

34:28.130 --> 34:30.130
When's the last time
you had a decent meal?

34:30.150 --> 34:33.350
- Honestly,um...
- I don't know.

34:33.360 --> 34:36.690
Well,let's just go and get
some food into the both of you.

34:36.699 --> 34:37.760
Look,you go. I'll stay.

34:37.770 --> 34:39.310
No,you go. I'll stay.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.790
I've got this great idea.
Why don't the three of us go?

34:41.800 --> 34:43.090
We'll get a nurse to stay here.

34:43.100 --> 34:48.830
She'll come find you if she wakes up, and
then you can have a meal together for a change.

34:50.010 --> 34:52.290
What do you think?

34:53.320 --> 34:53.900
Okay.

34:53.909 --> 34:56.920
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah,let me just...

34:58.140 --> 35:03.780
Uh,mom... About the other
day, i'm... I'm sorry i yelled.

35:03.790 --> 35:06.860
What? I-i don't know
what you're talking about.

35:07.240 --> 35:11.160
I remember my son being worried
sick about his baby daughter.

35:11.170 --> 35:14.140
I don't remember any yelling.

35:14.160 --> 35:17.420
Yelling? Don't remember that.

35:20.540 --> 35:23.850
What? Oh,my gosh.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.990
- Oh,my god. It's thanksgiving.
- Yeah.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.640
I can't believe you did this.

35:29.650 --> 35:34.500
Well,we decided the bird was ambulatory,
so we dressed him up, drove him in.

35:35.070 --> 35:39.700
Hey,guys. Sorry,sorry i'm late, but here
is the lime jell-o with walnuts and bananas.

35:39.710 --> 35:43.230
And i have no idea what that has to do with
thanksgiving, but i'm--i'm not gonna eat it.

35:43.240 --> 35:46.300
I think it actuallcomes,like,
from early colonial times,

35:46.330 --> 35:48.590
It was something with,uh,
something to do with scurvy.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.440
Oh,it's justin's favorite is what it is.

35:50.450 --> 35:53.060
Kitty,it was very nice
for robert to come.

35:53.070 --> 35:54.890
Oh,come on,saul. Don't be sarcastic.

35:54.900 --> 35:56.860
He's got his whole
family in town,and--

35:56.870 --> 36:01.450
excuse me.I wasn't being sarcastic.
It was very nice for robert to come.

36:04.130 --> 36:06.090
Robert.

36:08.170 --> 36:11.380
- You didn't have to come.
- Yes,i did. I missed you.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.370
- Are you,uh, are you hungry?
- Yes.

36:15.380 --> 36:18.190
So,uh,how's kevin doing?
I-i haven't seen him today.

36:18.200 --> 36:23.290
Oh,you know,he's grumpy when he's awake and he
moans when he's asleep, which he's doing right now.

36:25.190 --> 36:29.420
Everybody grab a chair and
assume your usual positions.

36:29.430 --> 36:30.940
Oh,except for justin.

36:30.950 --> 36:34.140
We decided to let you sit at
the big person's table this year.

36:34.150 --> 36:37.460
- Yes. I made it. Uncle saul,i made it.
- No,no,no,no,no.

36:43.630 --> 36:46.490
- You awake?
- Yeah.

36:47.510 --> 36:48.560
How's it going?

36:48.570 --> 36:53.420
Oh,you know, i'm on a morphine
drip, so i can't complain, but god...

36:53.430 --> 36:56.610
I keep thinking... What
if it had been justin?

36:56.620 --> 36:59.200
Well,as soon as he healed, we
would've had an intervention.

36:59.210 --> 37:02.720
We might still need one,
the way i'm enjoying this.

37:05.620 --> 37:09.710
You know... I always thought it was you.

37:10.260 --> 37:11.970
Me,too.

37:11.990 --> 37:13.960
I can't explain it.

37:13.980 --> 37:14.940
There's just something, you know?

37:14.960 --> 37:19.580
I know,but this doesn't
change anything either.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.780
I keep wondering what dad
would think of all this.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.150
I imagine he'd be very happy.

37:25.170 --> 37:27.760
No,no,i meant... Us.

37:27.770 --> 37:31.070
We haven't been getting along,
we both know we've been faking it.

37:31.080 --> 37:34.830
Dad's not responsible for our problems.

37:37.060 --> 37:40.320
I'm sorry i fired you. I really am.

37:40.330 --> 37:41.120
It's okay.

37:41.130 --> 37:44.170
No,it's not, because
i put business first.

37:44.180 --> 37:47.920
And you know what i figured
out? That's bad for business.

37:47.930 --> 37:51.810
Ojai foods is not about
fruit. It never was.

37:51.820 --> 37:55.400
It's about us. It's about our family.

37:56.610 --> 37:59.210
Are you offering me a job?
Because i do already have one.

37:59.220 --> 38:01.440
Good,because i'm not.

38:01.450 --> 38:04.840
Besides, we still can't afford you.

38:05.450 --> 38:10.010
I just wanted to say thank
you... For everything.

38:17.990 --> 38:22.020
Oh,nora,i forgot to tell you,um, those
nurses send their compliments to the chef.

38:22.030 --> 38:24.030
Okay,everybody,attention.

38:24.050 --> 38:28.730
I have a bottle of sparkling apple
cider, and it's an excellent year.

38:28.740 --> 38:33.580
You know, everybody in this building is--is
on some kind of drug, and we can't even drink.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.610
That's not fair.

38:35.620 --> 38:38.380
And that's not sparkling cider.

38:40.020 --> 38:42.500
I'd like to try the sparkling
apple cider,uncle saul.

38:42.510 --> 38:44.610
Some sparkling apple cider
for sister sarah,please.

38:44.630 --> 38:47.580
Since when did you two become amish?

38:50.090 --> 38:51.750
Rebecca,you don't have
anything on your plate.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.070
Yeah,i'm just saving room because
we're going to my mom's later.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.460
- Well,that certainly hasn't been stopping justin,has it?
- Yeah,seriously.

38:56.470 --> 38:58.940
I just don't want to
hurt mom's feelings.

38:59.410 --> 39:01.140
Julia,could you pass
me the cranberry sauce?

39:01.170 --> 39:04.600
- Oh,i think i may have finished that.
- Justin.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.660
What? I mean,i can give
you some of my cran--

39:06.670 --> 39:08.250
uh,no.That's fine.

39:08.260 --> 39:10.370
You know,i've got a toast.

39:10.380 --> 39:14.090
To elizabeth, my
strong,little granddaughter,

39:14.120 --> 39:18.320
Who,this year, out of all the
thanksgivings we've spent together,

39:18.340 --> 39:21.610
- Has given us so much to be thankful for.
- Thank you.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.190
To elizabeth.

39:23.200 --> 39:27.510
Oh,and i'd like to propose a toast to
paige and cooper, who couldn't be here.

39:27.530 --> 39:32.110
You know, i've had a little taste of
why mama was so disappointed at the idea

39:32.140 --> 39:35.320
Of not having anksgiving
with her children.

39:35.330 --> 39:39.320
So to mom--thank you
for this fabulous meal.

39:39.330 --> 39:41.460
- Yeah.
- To nora.

39:41.470 --> 39:42.770
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

39:42.780 --> 39:46.140
Okay,i have--i have one more
toast. Sorry. Just one more.

39:46.150 --> 39:49.770
Every thanksgiving, when mom asks
kevin if he would like a piece of pie,

39:49.800 --> 39:55.870
Kevin always says the same thing, and then he
proceeds to eat half of the pie all by himself.

39:57.410 --> 40:02.310
So here's to kevin, who this year,
gave new meaning to the phrase,

40:02.330 --> 40:05.170
"oh,just a sliver."

40:06.230 --> 40:07.870
Just a sliver.

40:07.880 --> 40:11.930
That is the worst, most
tasteless toast i have ever heard.

40:11.940 --> 40:14.510
- Oh,kevin.
- Hey,mom.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.900
Look at him.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.870
- How you feeling?
- I'm fine.

40:20.880 --> 40:26.310
No-- no,no,no. You don't want
any sparkling apple cider.
