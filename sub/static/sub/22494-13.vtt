Charmed to finally meet your
acquaintance, Mari-- oh!

00:46.819 --> 00:49.040
Did a pig shit out a dead
fetus in here?

00:49.125 --> 00:50.424
[sniffs] Oh-ho-ho!

00:50.426 --> 00:51.826
I beg-a you forgiveness.

00:51.828 --> 00:54.118
I come-a here
through the sewer line.

00:55.231 --> 00:55.796
Eh?

00:55.798 --> 00:56.898
Mario's a plumber.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.870
So he commutes
through human waste?

00:58.935 --> 01:00.101
And he's Italian.

01:00.103 --> 01:01.535
Oh, okay. Say no more.

01:01.537 --> 01:03.271
[chimes play]

01:03.273 --> 01:05.047
Did you lose something,
Mario?

01:05.081 --> 01:06.874
Hey, hey!
I-a found-a one!

01:06.876 --> 01:08.242
[chuckles] Yes.

01:08.244 --> 01:09.944
In <i>our</i> sofa.

01:09.946 --> 01:10.745
[ding!]

01:10.747 --> 01:12.246
And there it goes.

01:12.248 --> 01:13.781
So I says, "Aye, paisan,

01:13.783 --> 01:17.706
toilet paper and-a paper towels--
They ain't the same thing!"

01:17.741 --> 01:18.052
[laughs]

01:18.054 --> 01:21.055
[sarcastically] Mm, another
clogged toilet story.

01:21.057 --> 01:23.824
What a delightful compliment to
our mushroom soup.

Mushrooms?! Ay-yi-yi!

01:25.827 --> 01:27.762

01:27.764 --> 01:30.202
Remind me to bring mushrooms
on our honeymoon.

01:30.203 --> 01:34.502
I'm so sorry.
I have a few allergies.

01:34.504 --> 01:36.404
Mama mia! Flowers!

Oh! My drapes!

01:42.145 --> 01:43.544

02:06.069 --> 02:07.535
I'm okay. I'm okay.

02:07.537 --> 02:09.169
Slight miscalculation.

02:09.172 --> 02:12.833
Science must not be stopped.
I shall attempt again.

02:54.283 --> 02:55.416
Oh, God.

02:55.418 --> 03:00.192
Philip and I-- We had a fight...
A terrible, terrible fight,

03:00.227 --> 03:04.295
and he -- he broke
up with [sobbing] me!

03:04.330 --> 03:06.171
Maybe if you tried dating a
girl for once.

03:06.171 --> 03:07.403
Frank! Be nice.

03:07.405 --> 03:08.071
Nice?

03:08.073 --> 03:12.056
Nice is a father who wants his
son to have the best of everything

03:12.091 --> 03:14.887
and digs through fresh
graves for two weeks--

03:14.913 --> 03:18.789
Two weeks-- to find a big,
thick, veiny penis to give him.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.417
And then you go and put the heart
of a little schoolgirl in his chest.

03:21.419 --> 03:24.360
I wanted him to have some
sensitivity, unlike his father.

03:24.689 --> 03:25.988
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

03:25.990 --> 03:27.557
Is there anything we can do?

03:27.559 --> 03:28.391
Oh, mumsy!

03:28.393 --> 03:31.436
He said he never wanted to talk
to me again!

03:31.471 --> 03:32.742
And if you were a real man,

03:32.812 --> 03:34.813
you would have ripped off
his lower jaw

03:34.848 --> 03:37.811
so he <i>couldn't</i> talk
to you, or anyone else, ever!

03:38.036 --> 03:39.502
Oh, dadums--

03:39.504 --> 03:41.938
Dad! Call me Dad! Or Pops!

03:41.940 --> 03:44.407
Or Pa! The old man!
Anything!

03:44.409 --> 03:46.309
Frank!
But for the love of God--

03:46.311 --> 03:48.850
Stop that, Frank.
Can't you see he's in pain?

03:48.885 --> 03:50.746
A pitchfork in the chest--
That's pain, okay?

03:50.882 --> 03:53.015
Somebody lighting your

04:06.831 --> 04:08.998
Frankie, I-I'm sorry.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.681
I didn't mean
all those things I said.

04:10.716 --> 04:13.381
- There's-- there's just been so much--
- Oh, Philip. I don't care.

04:13.416 --> 04:17.072

You're my yummy mummy.

Ugh. All right.

04:21.045 --> 04:22.897
I'm going upstairs
to take a shit.

04:22.914 --> 04:26.102
Maybe I can mold some sort of a
real son out of that.

04:26.551 --> 04:28.184
Excuse me, God.

04:29.189 --> 04:32.111
Can you make something so heavy
even <i>you</i> can't lift it?

04:32.624 --> 04:35.330
I am fucking eating!
Jesus?!

04:35.827 --> 04:36.726
Yes?

04:36.728 --> 04:38.991

04:39.597 --> 04:41.561
- All right. Come on.
- I thought you were cool, man!

04:41.596 --> 04:42.987
I thought
you were gonna be cool.

04:44.435 --> 04:46.769
Throw it in the fire,
Mr. Frodo.

04:46.771 --> 04:50.500
No! The ring is mine, Sam!

04:55.166 --> 04:59.682

Give us back my precious!

04:59.717 --> 05:00.583
Bleh!

05:00.585 --> 05:06.657
We found Hobbitses' finger, but
where is my precious?

05:06.692 --> 05:10.108
It's there.
It's-- It's just further back.

05:11.729 --> 05:12.862
[choking]

05:12.864 --> 05:13.963
It's there.

05:13.965 --> 05:17.421
Yeah, right there.
But it's stuck.

05:17.456 --> 05:20.513
You'll have to use your tongue
and get it all wet.

05:20.548 --> 05:22.171
You're almost there.

05:22.173 --> 05:24.273
Just a little more.

05:24.275 --> 05:27.325
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yes.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.150
Yes!

05:28.185 --> 05:30.880
The shire!

05:30.882 --> 05:33.049
Where's precious?

05:33.051 --> 05:36.506
Here. You've earned it.

05:36.541 --> 05:38.273
My precious!

05:38.308 --> 05:39.488
[laughs]

05:46.465 --> 05:47.846
Whoopsie.

05:47.881 --> 05:51.813
If Hobbitses puts
my precious on,

05:51.848 --> 05:55.711
we will have to try and
takes it again, won't we?

05:55.746 --> 05:57.340
Mm-hmm.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.038
I got a large double
half-caf, non-fat mocha with soy

06:01.073 --> 06:03.446
- for Kltpzysam?
- That's <i>Kltpzyxm.</i>

06:03.448 --> 06:05.697
Oh! No, wait!

06:05.732 --> 06:05.982

06:07.082 --> 06:09.051
[laughs] Better luck next
time, Mxyzptlk!

06:09.053 --> 06:10.950
Dude, you can't be back here.

06:11.446 --> 06:13.189
The L.Z. may be swarming
with covenant, marines,

06:13.191 --> 06:16.002
but you'll have the master chief
backing you up.

06:16.037 --> 06:18.724
I'm sorry I can't show you what
I really look like.

06:18.759 --> 06:20.273
Chief, do we have enough
ammo for all these--

06:20.308 --> 06:22.398
I'm gonna have to stop you
right there, soldier.

06:22.400 --> 06:26.654
I know I look pretty generic, but
that's so you can identify with me.

06:28.833 --> 06:29.438
Does anyone have a question

06:29.440 --> 06:33.042
that's not about
what I look like?

06:33.530 --> 06:35.810
All right, then.
This is it, boys.

I'm dying, chief!

06:44.815 --> 06:48.393
If you think I'll give you a
dying peek at my face, I'm sorry.

06:48.428 --> 06:49.988
Not gonna happen.

06:50.023 --> 06:54.535
Despite thousands of years of people readily
identifying with distinct protagonists,

06:54.570 --> 06:58.421
I believe showing my face
would alienate my audience.

06:58.456 --> 06:59.875
Will you shut the fuck up!

06:59.910 --> 07:01.833
Where is your gun?!

07:04.776 --> 07:05.541
What?!

07:05.543 --> 07:08.025
I can't tell what you're doing
with your face!

07:08.060 --> 07:08.684
It's a secret.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.228
Well, you better be crying in
there, dickbag, because you were

07:11.263 --> 07:12.561
our last line of defense.

07:14.819 --> 07:18.057
I swear, your expression better
be one of awed epiphany at how

07:18.092 --> 07:19.510
badly you just fucked up
right now.

07:21.392 --> 07:23.785
Can I use your gun if I find
you a needler?

07:23.820 --> 07:24.994
What the fuck did you just
say to me?

07:25.262 --> 07:28.352
If you want to call me an asshole,
you better say it to my face!

07:28.599 --> 07:32.628
You three drowned and melted a woman
based on the color of her skin.

07:32.663 --> 07:34.756
In this court's eyes,
that is a hate crime.

07:34.791 --> 07:36.265
- It was Doro--
- Shut up, Lion!

07:36.300 --> 07:37.921
I don't want to go down for
that bitch!

07:37.956 --> 07:40.299
She ain't missing me
"Most of All," is she?

07:40.334 --> 07:43.078
The court finds you guilty of
murder and sentences you to 10

07:43.080 --> 07:45.876
to 15 years in a
maximum-security prison.

07:46.283 --> 07:47.849
But that ain't fair!

07:47.851 --> 07:49.384
Who was our lawyer?

07:49.386 --> 07:52.822
Sorry, boys-- Good at
flying, bad at lawyering.

07:56.159 --> 07:58.560
I'm gonna rape me a robot
tonight!

08:00.297 --> 08:02.611
Got a new fish for you,
Simmons.

08:04.568 --> 08:05.467
That's my bunk.

08:05.469 --> 08:07.043
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:07.078 --> 08:09.104
- I'll move it down to--
- That one's taken, too, silly straw.

08:09.106 --> 08:11.840
Oh. Okay, um, where do I--

08:11.842 --> 08:14.629
Well, I'll rent you that bunk up
there, but the rent ain't cheap.

08:14.878 --> 08:15.684
That'd be just swell.

08:15.785 --> 08:18.085
You got any jelly or some
kind of syrup or something?

08:18.382 --> 08:19.214
Hmm? For what?

08:19.216 --> 08:21.493
For eating my dick with!

08:21.528 --> 08:24.219
You want that bunk, you got to
toss my salad, prag, or you can

08:24.254 --> 08:26.640
let me add some stuffing to your
muffin-- either way.

08:27.324 --> 08:29.124
[prisoners shouting]

08:29.126 --> 08:31.960
[crying]

08:31.962 --> 08:34.029
Oh, don't listen to them.

08:34.030 --> 08:36.774
They don't have to be so mean.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.643
Come on, buddy.
You've got courage now.

08:39.678 --> 08:41.403
We do a simple dime to 15.

08:41.405 --> 08:42.703
I guess you're right.

08:42.706 --> 08:46.645
Of course I'm right.
You'll see. It's gonna be fine.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.385
"I just don't have the heart."

09:01.191 --> 09:03.082

09:06.163 --> 09:09.213
Oh, Scarecrow, what has
happened to you?

09:09.248 --> 09:10.880
[chuckles]
This place--

09:10.915 --> 09:12.367
This place happened to me.

09:12.369 --> 09:13.501
Is it that bad?

09:13.503 --> 09:15.203
It ain't Kansas, sugarpop.

09:15.205 --> 09:17.951
Oh, dear!
Is there anything I can do?

09:17.986 --> 09:19.270
Why don't you show me a
little skin?

09:19.609 --> 09:21.574
Put 'em on the glass.

09:21.609 --> 09:24.779
- Um, I'm sure I don't know--
- Your tits! Your totos!

09:24.781 --> 09:26.647
Put 'em on the glass!

09:27.951 --> 09:31.119
[crying]

No, I can't. I just can't.

09:34.424 --> 09:37.134
Auntie Em raised a real bitch.

09:38.799 --> 09:40.862
Oh, no.
No. No, no.

09:40.864 --> 09:42.397
No, no, no, no.

Noooooo!

09:47.371 --> 09:49.537
I swear, that's the truth--

09:49.539 --> 09:51.313
And I ain't <i>lion.</i>
