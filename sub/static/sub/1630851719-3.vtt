-[cheering]
-[applause]

00:11.553 --> 00:12.929
[woman] She said yes!

00:13.013 --> 00:15.265
[cheering continues]

00:16.141 --> 00:19.227
It's such a cliché,
saying it was love at first sight, but,

00:19.310 --> 00:20.478
I mean, I think it was.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.939
She worked with my cousin.
I saw her and I was like,

00:23.023 --> 00:25.275
"Um, who is that? Who's that?"

00:25.358 --> 00:26.651
And he's like, "Stop."

00:26.735 --> 00:28.903
-[laughs] "Stop it."
-"She has a boyfriend."

00:28.987 --> 00:32.240
He's like, "Relax."
And I was like, "Okay. Sorry."

00:33.241 --> 00:36.870
The concept of having sex
was not foreign to us,

00:36.953 --> 00:38.747
but what do you define as sex?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.415
-What do you…
-Yeah.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.709
What is lesbian sex?

00:42.792 --> 00:44.335
What is, like, the protocol?

00:44.419 --> 00:46.337
-What are we supposed to do?
-Yeah.

00:48.339 --> 00:50.800
[sensual music playing]

00:57.766 --> 01:00.393
-Do you want to start first?
-Okay. [laughs]

01:00.477 --> 01:03.938
-Um, I'm Shandra and… Camille.
-Hi, I'm Camille.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.192
We've been together for…
It'll be six years in May.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.152
We just got engaged, so we are…

01:09.235 --> 01:11.321
-[woman] Aw!
-Congratulations.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.615
-So, we--
-I'm very excited about it. Sorry.

01:13.698 --> 01:17.368
I was already on, like, the outs
with my then-boyfriend,

01:17.452 --> 01:20.789
and I met her,
and it was just kind of this, like,

01:20.872 --> 01:23.249
"Oh, that's what I've been missing."

01:23.333 --> 01:25.543
It's hard when you're in
a new relationship

01:25.627 --> 01:28.129
and you're trying
to be intimate with this person.

01:28.213 --> 01:31.257
You're in your head and you're thinking,
"What am I gonna do wrong?"

01:31.341 --> 01:33.593
And it was very nerve-racking because

01:33.676 --> 01:37.180
I did still kind of have
that shame of who I was.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.517
I grew up
in a very religious home. [chuckles]

01:40.600 --> 01:42.852
My mom was a Jehovah's Witness and so…

01:42.936 --> 01:44.270
-They love lesbians.
-[all laugh]

01:44.354 --> 01:47.107
Yeah. They… Huge fans.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.441
[Camille] Biggest lesbian fans.

01:48.525 --> 01:51.111
We never talked
about sex in our household,

01:51.194 --> 01:55.031
especially lesbian sex,
we never talked about.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.908
So I'm… [sighs]

01:56.991 --> 02:00.036
I'm excited to kind of see
what we can learn during this process.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.204
[Camille] Yeah.

02:01.287 --> 02:04.165
This was one of my first
relationships with a woman,

02:04.249 --> 02:06.459
and just body image-wise,

02:06.543 --> 02:10.130
I definitely want to gain
more confidence in the bedroom.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.215
And when you don't have
a lot of confidence,

02:12.298 --> 02:14.425
your sex drive kind of like just…

02:14.509 --> 02:16.010
-It dwindles.
-Dwindles and--

02:16.094 --> 02:18.847
It's hard to feel sexy
when you don't feel sexy.

02:18.930 --> 02:19.764
Yeah.

02:19.848 --> 02:23.893
Both of us have a lot of issues with
being in our heads when it comes to sex,

02:23.977 --> 02:28.439
and I think there's just
a lack of education and,

02:28.523 --> 02:30.942
you know, resources out there
that we can go to

02:31.025 --> 02:35.155
for people who have relationships
and people who have sex like us.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.323
There's something so incredible

02:37.407 --> 02:41.536
when you are willing
to ongoingly work on your relationship,

02:41.619 --> 02:45.915
and there's all kinds of things that,
with a bit of skill and intervention,

02:45.999 --> 02:46.833
you can learn.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.002
[upbeat percussive music playing]

02:50.753 --> 02:56.009
We're on our way to day one
of our intensive with Darshana.

02:56.092 --> 02:59.345
It's a little shaky
because we're driving in LA, but--

02:59.429 --> 03:01.639
Darshana, we're coming for you.

03:01.723 --> 03:05.393
I'm Darshana Avila
and I'm an erotic wholeness coach.

03:05.476 --> 03:08.229
-How are you?
-[Camille] Oh, hi! Can we hug? 

03:08.313 --> 03:09.939
-Yes.
-Hi.

03:10.023 --> 03:14.027
A lot of what I teach is around
how to learn intimacy building

03:14.110 --> 03:19.824
and cultivating skill
to help expand what is possible.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.001
Your identity is as lesbian women.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.837
Like, how did it feel
to come into claiming that?

03:33.671 --> 03:35.298
For me, it was… it was rough.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.634
I knew at a very young age, though.

03:37.717 --> 03:41.846
I knew since I was a kid
that I've had these feelings.

03:41.930 --> 03:46.142
It was just the environment I grew up in
was kind of smothering that,

03:46.226 --> 03:48.102
and, like, I hated myself.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.271
I didn't know that I was gay until…

03:52.065 --> 03:53.566
my early twenties.

03:53.650 --> 03:57.820
And I think we're at a place
where we wanna learn.

03:57.904 --> 04:02.617
We wanna learn things that we didn't get
a chance to learn when we were younger.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.161
The biggest thing for them as a couple,

04:05.245 --> 04:11.167
I think, is a claiming of
their authentic expression of lesbianism.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.586
Like, "How do we be lesbians together?"

04:13.670 --> 04:16.714
There's a lot of, like,
lesbian porn out there

04:16.798 --> 04:22.512
that is very clearly not lesbians,
or not made for lesbians, and it's…

04:23.179 --> 04:27.892
It just brings that memory back
of me being young and not out yet.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.852
And I'm like,
"Is this what I'm supposed to be?"

04:29.936 --> 04:33.106
"Is this how I'm supposed to act?
Is this how we have sex?"

04:33.189 --> 04:35.984
Because we are conditioned
to penis-in-vagina intercourse

04:36.067 --> 04:37.944
as, like, the gold standard,

04:38.027 --> 04:40.655
and the experience of the penis
in that equation

04:40.738 --> 04:42.865
outranking the experience of the vagina,

04:42.949 --> 04:46.911
there is a lot of confusion
and mystery of, like,

04:46.995 --> 04:49.831
what do two
vulva-bearing bodies do together?

04:49.914 --> 04:52.166
What do you know that you enjoy?

04:52.750 --> 04:57.171
I love, like, being dominated. I love…

04:57.255 --> 04:59.299
-Oh.
-I love when she's in charge.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.718
I love it when
I don't have to make decisions.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.970
-[laughs]
-Oh, my God.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.346
How do you feel about that?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.765
I am a giver. I love giving.

05:07.849 --> 05:11.227
And that turns me on, especially, and…

05:11.311 --> 05:12.437
-You know.
-Yeah.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.690
You felt it. It's like… And--

05:15.773 --> 05:18.860
I like when she, like, picks me up
or, like, throws me around

05:18.943 --> 05:21.279
because it makes me
feel so tiny, and I like it.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.406
-I don't know why. I--
-[Darshana] Yeah.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.241
-I like--
-I throw her gently around.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.410
Yeah. Consensually throws me around.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.828
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.788
We're extremely passionate people.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.291
Yeah. I was just gonna say.
Both of us are very, like,

05:33.374 --> 05:36.461
"Zero or 100, kind of nowhere in between"
kind of people.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.172
[Darshana] Would you like to explore
one through 99?

05:39.255 --> 05:40.089
Yeah. I would.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.301
This is a moment when I tell Lindsey
to bring sex toys into the room.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.011
-Hey.
-Uh-oh.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.346
-Yay.
-[Shandra laughing]

05:46.429 --> 05:48.514
-We're all about it. Yeah.
-[Darshana] All about it.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.726
Well, I'm gonna reach over here, then.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.854
Camille and Shandra
did let it be very clearly known

05:54.937 --> 06:00.943
that they were interested in bringing
more into their sexual styles and lives.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.654
[Camille] Is it naive of me to say
I don't know what all of this is? 

06:03.738 --> 06:05.198
No, that's the whole point.

06:05.281 --> 06:09.202
When they have gone to a sex shop
in the past, or ordered something,

06:09.285 --> 06:14.540
it doesn't sound like they really had many
educational opportunities around that.

06:14.624 --> 06:19.670
So it was part of that missing experience
of shaping their identities as lesbians.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.298
-What is this? What the heck is this?
-Oh, I know what this is.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.550
-[laughs]
-Oh, you know what that is.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.261
Well, I just bought her
something for Valentine's Day.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.263
Yeah, I don't know
what it's called though.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.016
-Well, it's not a vibrator…
-There's a name for it.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.186
-…but it sucks.
-It's the suction one. That like--

06:35.269 --> 06:36.854
It, like… [sucks]

06:36.938 --> 06:38.648
-I want one now.
-Bless this thing.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.066
[Darshana] Bless the clit suckers.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.234
-God.
-[laughs]

06:41.317 --> 06:43.319
-So, is that what this is, then?
-That is.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.946
-That--
-What is this?

06:45.029 --> 06:47.031
-[Darshana] This is--
-Looks like a bracelet.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.574
-That's not a bracelet.
-I know.

06:48.658 --> 06:49.992
[Darshana] What you think it is?

06:50.076 --> 06:52.912
That looks like the thing that
you put on your nose to stop snoring.

06:52.995 --> 06:53.871
[all laugh]

06:53.955 --> 06:55.623
-But that's--
-It looks like…

06:55.706 --> 06:57.708
When you go to Disney World
and you're like…

06:57.792 --> 06:59.919
-That's what it… Sorry.
-[Shandra] The Magic Band?

07:00.002 --> 07:01.546
[Darshana] It is a magic band.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.673
-Is it?
-Of a certain sort.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.384
-Oh, dang.
-It is dual stimulation.

07:06.467 --> 07:10.596
And so you could have this
inside of one of you,

07:10.680 --> 07:13.391
and then use…
So, like, if you're scissoring or like--

07:13.474 --> 07:16.519
-Shit. Her mind was just blown just now.
-Oh, my God, yes.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.146
[Darshana] Or friction… Yeah.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.648
-So, both pieces…
-We'll be taking that one home.

07:20.731 --> 07:21.774
Both pieces vibrate.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.193
-[vibrates]
-Feel. Oh, my God.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.237
-[trills tongue]
-[Camille] I like it.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.448
Sorry. I'm excited about it.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.661
How about this one? [laughs]

07:33.744 --> 07:36.622
-My name is Joie.
-And my name is Mike.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.292
We've been together
this coming May for 12 years.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.002
I am 66 years old.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.795
I am 62 years old.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.339
Yes, it's gone quickly, to be honest.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.966
Time flies when we're having fun.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.635
Mike was upfront

07:49.719 --> 07:52.763
that sex was important to him
right when we met.

07:52.847 --> 07:56.309
It's healthy. I mean,
every day that I can start out, you know…

07:56.392 --> 07:59.103
Start the day out with a bang is a plus.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.857
We started out,
you know, as any couple does.

08:02.940 --> 08:06.694
The first few years, everything was
hot and heavy and, you know, and…

08:06.777 --> 08:10.156
And then, you know,
it has its ups and downs,

08:10.239 --> 08:12.450
so we need to keep it on the up side.

08:12.533 --> 08:15.036
Do I feel like I have enough sex?

08:15.536 --> 08:19.957
Sometimes it's not
as frequently as I would like.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.251
Uh, but when she gets into it,
she's into it.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.087
She just needs to get
a little motivated to get going.

08:25.171 --> 08:29.800
Mike will 90% initiate sex,
and then I will be pretty frank.

08:29.884 --> 08:33.179
"Maybe in the morning.
Not right now, I'm tired."

08:33.262 --> 08:36.516
It's sad to say, sometimes I'm like,
"I'm gonna catch up on this show."

08:36.599 --> 08:40.353
I mean, I can…
I can imagine how that sounds.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.023
He compares sex to brushing his teeth.

08:44.106 --> 08:47.485
"I can do this,
you know, once, twice a day."

08:47.568 --> 08:49.737
-And I'm just like…
-[all laughing]

08:49.820 --> 08:52.281
-[Joie] Yes.
-You're randy. I like it.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.533
[Michaela] I like it.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.326
-This will be interesting.
-[Gwyneth] I know.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.619
Talk is cheap.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.913
[all laugh]

08:58.996 --> 09:03.626
I think you're perfectly paired up
with your experts so far,

09:03.709 --> 09:07.713
and when you go into a therapy session
with a sense of adventure,

09:07.797 --> 09:10.049
then it's not so horrible and personal.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.635
It's more like, "Hey." You know?

09:12.718 --> 09:14.011
-"Let's see."
-Yeah.

09:14.804 --> 09:18.474
["Marimba Chant" playing]

09:24.188 --> 09:27.441
I'm Amina,
and I'm the director and founder

09:27.525 --> 09:30.319
of the Atlanta Institute
of Tantra and Divine Sexuality.

09:30.403 --> 09:34.240
So, people come to me sometimes just
because they want to learn how to squirt.

09:34.323 --> 09:38.369
The focus of my work
is on embodiment and sensuality,

09:38.452 --> 09:39.996
and really the expansion of that.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.999
-So that's what we're doing this weekend.
-Great.

09:43.082 --> 09:46.419
But some couples come to me
because they are very happy

09:46.502 --> 09:48.671
and they love everything
about what's happening,

09:48.754 --> 09:51.257
but one has a diminished desire.

09:51.340 --> 09:54.594
I work with them around
communicating their erotic needs.

10:00.433 --> 10:04.437
Erotic intimacy is
a primal desire that we have

10:04.520 --> 10:07.732
to be connected and
to be wild and free with someone.

10:07.815 --> 10:12.403
So, I'm gonna have you both just kind of
introduce your animal to each other,

10:12.486 --> 10:14.822
and there's gonna be
a little bit of crawling.

10:15.364 --> 10:17.116
I want you to seduce each other.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.368
So, you're looking at each other

10:19.452 --> 10:20.786
and then you're… [sniffs]

10:20.870 --> 10:24.373
...you're smelling each other
and taking in each other's scents.

10:24.457 --> 10:30.421
You are maybe growling a little bit,
or grunting or purring. Mmm.

10:30.504 --> 10:33.716
Just acknowledging each other's energy.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.595
And you can kind of
get into each other's energetic fields.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.596
How's that sound?

10:39.764 --> 10:40.723
Different.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.558
[all laughing]

10:43.142 --> 10:46.937
The animal crawl is, like, my favorite
thing to do, 'cause it is weird.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.150
And what I love,
'cause it happens every single time,

10:51.233 --> 10:53.736
is everybody
smells each other's butt. [laughs]

10:53.819 --> 10:55.905
It's my favorite thing.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.118
[growls]

11:02.536 --> 11:04.163
[howls]

11:04.789 --> 11:08.876
[Joie] I've always been
a type-A personality.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.294
Acting like an animal?

11:10.378 --> 11:15.841
Yeah, that's not something
I would normally do, even for foreplay.

11:17.677 --> 11:23.349
It's not customary to see couples
in their sixties talking about sex,

11:23.432 --> 11:24.475
thinking about sex,

11:24.558 --> 11:28.020
and it's probably gonna be challenging
on some level to certain people

11:28.104 --> 11:32.400
who are thinking, "I don't want to
think about older people having sex."

11:32.483 --> 11:35.069
[whimsical music playing]

11:36.320 --> 11:38.280
But we are sexual beings.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.617
And that means we're sexual beings
until the day we die.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.077
-[growls]
-[laughs]

11:43.160 --> 11:47.623
Or until the day we decide
we want to retire that part of our lives.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.251
We don't stop wanting to have pleasure,

11:50.334 --> 11:54.755
and, uh,
I'm really happy that in his sixties,

11:54.839 --> 11:56.257
he was also willing to go,

11:56.340 --> 12:00.261
"Well, okay, if I want twice a day,
I'm gonna have to learn a few new tricks."

12:00.344 --> 12:03.973
Crawling around, it lets you
really get into your body.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.558
[all laughing]

12:05.641 --> 12:07.184
[Amina] And it was just fun.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.187
We take this whole ride too seriously.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.983
Can we acknowledge that
sex is how we play as adults?

12:14.066 --> 12:14.984
How you guys doing?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.445
-[Mike] I dunno. How are we doing?
-[laughs]

12:17.528 --> 12:20.197
Doing great. This is excellent.
You're doing wonderful.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.198
Okay.

12:21.991 --> 12:25.745
So, we have our thinking brain,
which is always going,

12:25.828 --> 12:28.581
and then we have our being-feeling body.

12:28.664 --> 12:32.585
So next we're going
to move into a meditation

12:32.668 --> 12:37.173
that's gonna actually help you even get
a little bit more deeply into the body.

12:37.256 --> 12:40.259
Go ahead and
just get comfortable, lie down.

12:40.342 --> 12:44.930
Have you ever had, um,
any BDSM play before? Been tied up?

12:45.514 --> 12:46.724
-No.
-Yes.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.934
[all laughing]

12:49.018 --> 12:52.271
Well, I'm gonna tie you up today.
Not in that fun, kinky way.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.858
But what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
put this strap on you, on your legs.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.444
This is gonna let the body relax.
So, what I'm gonna do…

12:58.527 --> 13:02.573
Breath is probably
the most important function in sex to me.

13:02.656 --> 13:07.036
I always have to remind myself this,
still, years later,

13:07.119 --> 13:12.124
because I learned about
how to be sexy from porn.

13:13.083 --> 13:16.420
And in porn, the women breathe like this…

13:16.504 --> 13:19.131
[pants]

13:19.924 --> 13:23.427
Almost every woman
that I've ever been with sexually,

13:23.511 --> 13:24.845
that I've ever coached,

13:24.929 --> 13:28.891
has also done the same thing,
'cause somebody told us.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.018
[pants]

13:31.101 --> 13:32.895
We're not out of breath.
What are we doing?

13:32.978 --> 13:35.314
Why are we breathing like this?
It doesn't make sense.

13:35.397 --> 13:38.609
Look, a body has
a real serious function in life,

13:38.692 --> 13:40.319
and that's to keep us from dying.

13:40.402 --> 13:44.073
And if we're telling it
that we're not relaxed,

13:44.156 --> 13:47.618
then it's like, "All right, what are we
tense about? Who's coming to get us?"

13:47.701 --> 13:52.957
When you stop that nonsense
that we borrowed from, you know,

13:53.040 --> 13:56.669
from socialization, and we move
into this very deep way of breathing…

13:56.752 --> 13:58.254
[inhales deeply]

13:58.337 --> 14:00.339
[exhales]

14:01.006 --> 14:03.509
[Amina] Now we're in a space
where we open up to pleasure.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.471
[exhales]

14:10.933 --> 14:12.726
[Darshana]
This is more of a teaching session.

14:12.810 --> 14:16.063
You might end up feeling like
you get, like, super into it,

14:16.146 --> 14:20.150
and that's great,
but if you don't, that's okay too.

14:20.234 --> 14:24.488
The teaching is gonna be specifically
around some ideas related to position.

14:24.572 --> 14:27.741
So, you're welcome to undress if you wish.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.203
You're welcome to undress each other.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.289
I'm gonna chuck my sweater off.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.082
-There's layers.
-Layers.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.918
[Camille] Don't mind me.
Don't mind my butt.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.837
-[Shandra] Perfect butt, right?
-Okay.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.464
Why don't you start belly to belly?

14:44.216 --> 14:45.885
-Oh, there she goes.
-[giggles]

14:45.968 --> 14:47.887
[Darshana] Drop in with your breath.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.932
And so you might begin with some touch.

14:52.016 --> 14:56.270
When it comes to technique, like, yes,
it's good to know some basic things

14:56.353 --> 14:59.607
about how to touch bodies,
how to touch vulvas,

14:59.690 --> 15:02.318
and those are teachable skills.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.905
Slide your leg
in between the other's. Yep.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.782
-[Shandra] Ooh. That's--
-[Darshana] Get in… There we go.

15:08.866 --> 15:12.745
It's a great position
for ass grabbing and stroking.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.663
Your mom cannot watch this.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.956
[both laugh]

15:16.040 --> 15:18.792
My main interest in supporting them

15:18.876 --> 15:24.048
was to just create as much space and
permission for them to be authentic.

15:24.131 --> 15:27.009
This is a great way to have reach.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.886
So, you can do a lot of thigh-stroking,

15:28.969 --> 15:31.555
you can hold her hips,
you can grab her ass,

15:31.639 --> 15:34.016
as well as be stimulating her vulva,

15:34.099 --> 15:35.601
penetrating her vagina.

15:35.684 --> 15:39.688
When it comes to positions,
the best are the positions that feel good.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.902
["Aquarium (A Cappella)"
by Paul Sandrone playing]

15:52.409 --> 15:58.207
So, what we're gonna do now is, I'm gonna
show you how to initiate and offer touch

15:58.290 --> 16:02.586
in a way that is sensual
but not necessarily sexual.

16:02.670 --> 16:06.465
One of the things that I noticed with Joie

16:06.548 --> 16:10.552
is there's this nudge
that needs to be in place

16:10.636 --> 16:14.431
to remind the body
that we're moving towards pleasure,

16:14.515 --> 16:17.434
and that we're used to in foreplay

16:17.518 --> 16:22.147
or in other activities
to kind of build up sexual anticipation,

16:22.231 --> 16:23.899
which leads to desire.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.193
Start with just some gentle hand-touching.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.904
Then you're gonna eventually
move through the whole body.

16:28.988 --> 16:34.034
And I'm assuming eyes closed
just as far as concentrating on the touch?

16:34.118 --> 16:36.745
-Don't concentrate on anything.
-[Amina] Yeah, so… Yeah.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.039
-[laughs]
-[Mike] Let your mind go clear.

16:39.123 --> 16:43.252
For Joie, I think a whole day
of building up to the evening

16:43.335 --> 16:46.463
is really what would be great.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.966
And Mike's language is not that.

16:49.049 --> 16:53.929
Mike wakes up, he's ready with some
morning wood and ready to deliver.

16:54.013 --> 17:00.936
And so for him, understanding the need
for touch without having that need,

17:01.020 --> 17:06.025
the need for slowness,
the need for more foreplay, wasn't there.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.361
One of the joys of this practice,
Mike, for you,

17:09.445 --> 17:12.698
it's just really witnessing
what I witness right now, which is,

17:13.407 --> 17:16.368
kind of, the stress
just leaving the face a little bit,

17:16.452 --> 17:19.580
her shoulders shifting, her hip shifting,

17:19.663 --> 17:22.249
and knowing that
you are the catalyst for that.

17:22.332 --> 17:25.502
It can be hard sometimes
for her to let go and relax.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.296
Yeah.

17:27.379 --> 17:30.007
-Well, here you have her completely still.
-Right.

17:34.219 --> 17:37.931
Sometimes, the only time
I get touched during the day is at night.

17:38.015 --> 17:41.351
He will kiss you goodbye,
kiss you hello, you know,

17:41.435 --> 17:43.687
but it's a little peck,
you know, out the door.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.357
And then remember that
this is an act of worship.

17:47.441 --> 17:52.905
So, your touch is really a gift that
you're giving to your goddess right now.

17:54.031 --> 17:57.159
Even though my parents
had four sons in five years,

17:57.242 --> 18:01.705
my folks didn't really
give us a lot of insight.

18:01.789 --> 18:05.375
So, you know,
we shared notes with our friends,

18:05.459 --> 18:07.544
we read Playboy and Hustler.

18:07.628 --> 18:13.050
People may teach you, "Well, this is
how the sexual act results in a child,"

18:13.133 --> 18:16.595
but nobody's really teaching you
how to please a woman,

18:16.678 --> 18:18.138
how to make her happy.

18:18.222 --> 18:22.768
You know, not all porn is realistic
to what real relationships look like.

18:33.862 --> 18:38.117
You willing to get on all fours
and face your booty toward your beloved?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.327
-Sure. Let's do it.
-[Darshana chuckles]

18:40.410 --> 18:42.871
-We're already here. It's like…
-Yeah, let's do it.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.875
So, you can be in this position and
then there's like, a lot of yummy access,

18:46.959 --> 18:51.547
and then you can also get,
like, closer in, in this position

18:51.630 --> 18:54.508
and also have a lot of, like… [grunts]

18:54.591 --> 18:57.094
-Oh, I like that.
-You can pull… You like that.

18:57.177 --> 19:00.013
[Camille] This is where we could
definitely use one of these, like…

19:00.764 --> 19:01.807
[Shandra] This is great.

19:01.890 --> 19:04.685
Yeah. This is where I feel like
you could use this, for sure.

19:04.768 --> 19:05.644
Yeah.

19:06.895 --> 19:09.773
-There are cameras on me now.
-I'm not gonna do it to you, but…

19:09.857 --> 19:14.069
How about instead of like, putting a toy
right on your un-warmed up yoni,

19:14.153 --> 19:16.405
like, maybe, can you reach your hand?

19:16.488 --> 19:19.700
I'm sensing part of you is like,
"I really want to play with this toy!"

19:19.783 --> 19:22.661
-I do. And I'm scared right now.
-But your body's not ready for…

19:22.744 --> 19:25.205
Like, we haven't
done anything to get you ready.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.457
-That's what's terrifying me now.
-That's okay.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.458
Yeah, that's true.

19:28.542 --> 19:34.506
What we saw there with Camille,
I think, was a really potent example

19:34.590 --> 19:39.011
of someone who's overriding
and overextending herself.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.140
Camille, do you wanna say anything
about how you're feeling right now,

19:43.223 --> 19:46.059
and let there be some space
for those emotions?

19:46.143 --> 19:48.478
I don't know why
I'm having so much anxiety now.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.732
It's not something I'm used to doing
with other people in the room,

19:51.815 --> 19:55.277
so I'm very aware of that right now,

19:55.360 --> 19:58.530
and I'm trying really hard
to just focus on you.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.242
But getting in my head is my specialty,

20:02.326 --> 20:05.412
and I can feel myself
doing that right now.

20:05.495 --> 20:06.413
[Darshana] Great.

20:06.496 --> 20:10.751
She was so enthusiastically
wanting to, like, talk about the sex toys

20:10.834 --> 20:12.461
and play with different positions.

20:12.544 --> 20:16.423
Like, she had an idea
in her head of what she wanted,

20:16.506 --> 20:18.383
and then there was the lived reality of,

20:18.467 --> 20:21.261
at a certain point,
she wasn't actually there anymore.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.847
Can I offer a few options?

20:23.931 --> 20:24.932
Yeah.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.017
Would you like
to put your clothes back on?

20:27.100 --> 20:29.144
-Sure. Yeah. Maybe that'll help.
-Let's do that.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.021
Okay. [chuckles]

20:31.104 --> 20:32.689
I was just trying to be in the moment.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.609
-Maybe that's not the right thing.
-This is being in the moment.

20:35.692 --> 20:39.279
In this moment, you need something
different than you needed before.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.197
[Camille] Okay.

20:40.280 --> 20:45.494
And we witnessed her continue
to follow the known pattern of,

20:45.577 --> 20:48.288
"No, it's a little uncomfortable,
but I'm gonna do it anyway."

20:48.872 --> 20:50.332
Oh, gosh. I'm taking up so much time.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.751
-[Darshana] Sweetie, this is--
-[Shandra] It's fine, it's all good.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.920
[Darshana] This is your space and time.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.505
There's no apology needed.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.882
No one is expecting anything.

20:58.966 --> 21:02.552
When I suggested that she might
want to put her clothes back on,

21:02.636 --> 21:04.513
was the pivotal moment.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.724
Okay, that… Apparently that's
what I needed. I already feel better.

21:07.808 --> 21:08.642
-Do you?
-Yeah.

21:08.725 --> 21:09.726
That's fine.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.020
[Camille sighs]

21:12.104 --> 21:15.190
-It's okay.
-I don't like my body, I don't think.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.945
-[sighs] See, I'm getting in my head.
-I know.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.029
About my body.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.658
[Darshana] Let's talk about it.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.868
I'm just, like, hyper aware of it.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.663
I didn't think I would be like this.

21:29.746 --> 21:30.789
Babe, it's okay.

21:30.872 --> 21:36.295
I had this perception of myself that
I was open and cool and confident,

21:36.378 --> 21:39.089
and that body shaming doesn't affect me.

21:39.172 --> 21:42.592
And, uh,
I found out that I'm very much wrong

21:42.676 --> 21:45.012
and maybe even
lying to myself a little bit.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.181
I appreciate that you…

21:50.058 --> 21:53.729
love me, regardless of
what I look like on the outside.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.272
[sniffles]

21:55.355 --> 21:56.565
-Always.
-[chuckles]

22:02.154 --> 22:08.618
I think that shame is actually the most
corrosive emotion that we can have.

22:08.702 --> 22:12.289
It's such a terrible voice inside our head

22:12.372 --> 22:18.086
that's so old, we're taught to feel
ashamed of ourselves when we're so little.

22:18.170 --> 22:22.549
I grew up very, um,
heavily in dance and ballet,

22:22.632 --> 22:26.887
and appearing to not be perfect
was a very, very…

22:26.970 --> 22:28.388
It was a struggle for me.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.681
A lot, so…

22:29.765 --> 22:32.976
Body shame,
I've lived with it for almost 63 years,

22:33.060 --> 22:34.853
because I've see-sawed with weight,

22:34.936 --> 22:39.441
and even recently, nothing major,
but we're talking, like, 20 pounds.

22:39.524 --> 22:43.111
I've lost 1,000 pounds
over 60 some-odd years.

22:43.195 --> 22:47.699
I will say that my body image
does affect my intimacy at times,

22:47.783 --> 22:51.620
just because if I'm feeling
very heavy that day,

22:51.703 --> 22:55.415
I may, like, not want to, uh, engage.

22:55.999 --> 23:00.045
I think you're like, "Aw, jeez.
You know, well, at least it's dark."

23:23.235 --> 23:28.323
There are a lot of messages
that we have taken in since that big,

23:28.407 --> 23:33.787
as girls, as women, telling us what
our bodies were supposed to look like.

23:33.870 --> 23:39.584
And that negativity shows up for us
oftentimes in intimate spaces.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.295
We don't really, fully wanna be seen.

23:42.379 --> 23:45.715
"I don't want you to touch my belly,
I don't want you to touch this part."

23:45.799 --> 23:49.886
And so this exercise
really helps us challenge that idea

23:49.970 --> 23:55.684
so that we can start to see ourselves
as more whole, complete, beautiful,

23:55.767 --> 23:57.352
divine goddesses that we are.

23:58.437 --> 24:04.526
We have so much internalized
misogyny, and fatphobia, and ageism

24:04.609 --> 24:08.363
that we're always looking
for something to fix.

24:08.447 --> 24:13.034
"Oh, if my butt was a little bit bigger
or my waist was a little bit smaller."

24:14.369 --> 24:16.538
Mirror work challenges that.

24:18.081 --> 24:21.209
The first thing I want you to do
is just actually look at yourself.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.379
In fact, do you mind if I am…
If I disrobe?

24:24.463 --> 24:25.505
-No. That's fine.
-Okay.

24:26.506 --> 24:29.342
So, the first task we do, disrobe.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.930
And then you just stand
and you look at yourself,

24:34.014 --> 24:35.474
and you start thinking about,

24:36.266 --> 24:39.394
"Well, what do I like?
What do I see that's pleasant?"

24:39.478 --> 24:43.773
And then I also start looking at,
"Uh, you know, I'm in my forties now."

24:43.857 --> 24:45.817
So there's some things
that have shifted.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.528
My breasts, they're not
where they used to be, right?

24:48.612 --> 24:52.157
I'm starting to get dimples in places,
and I was an athlete, like you.

24:52.240 --> 24:57.704
So, those things challenge us when we have
this athleticism background, especially.

24:57.787 --> 25:02.250
So, I look at these things,
and I think about my breasts, for example,

25:02.334 --> 25:04.211
but then I also have to question. "Well…"

25:05.921 --> 25:09.633
"Who told me that breasts were
supposed to look a certain way?" Right?

25:09.716 --> 25:11.384
So as you start to look at yourself…

25:11.468 --> 25:15.013
Staring at yourself
fully naked and saying…

25:16.306 --> 25:20.060
"Huh. This is what I look like,"
first and foremost.

25:20.977 --> 25:23.563
"What don't I like? What do I like?"

25:24.272 --> 25:25.774
And then, "Why?"

25:25.857 --> 25:26.816
[chuckles]

25:27.400 --> 25:29.069
It's really about getting to the why.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.654
Where did I get that messaging?

25:30.737 --> 25:32.822
Because so much of what we don't like,

25:32.906 --> 25:36.660
and even a lot of what we do like
is coming from somebody else telling us,

25:36.743 --> 25:38.787
"This equates to desirability."

25:40.539 --> 25:44.709
And, listen, we all want to be desirable,
but whose voice is that?

25:45.710 --> 25:47.337
And do we want them?

25:47.420 --> 25:48.964
What do they do for me?

25:49.047 --> 25:52.425
Is this voice that
I now have planted in my head

25:52.509 --> 25:55.512
that's telling me
my stomach should be a little bit flatter,

25:56.096 --> 25:58.932
or my butt should be a little bit bigger,

25:59.015 --> 26:01.685
is that even someone that I desire?

26:02.811 --> 26:04.854
Why are they in my bedroom

26:04.938 --> 26:07.524
and my bathroom
when I look at myself in the mirror?

26:07.607 --> 26:09.985
I don't even know
if I'm attracted to that person.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.612
How did they get here,
and how do I evict them?

26:13.446 --> 26:14.447
[Darshana] So…

26:16.366 --> 26:17.450
This is you.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.911
If and when you're ready,

26:20.996 --> 26:23.707
you are welcome to disrobe
as much as you want,

26:23.790 --> 26:26.751
and that may or may not happen,
and that's okay.

26:31.715 --> 26:37.554
As you look at yourself, and there might
be voices of judgment, or shame, or fear,

26:37.637 --> 26:40.015
there might be repulsion or disgust…

26:43.393 --> 26:45.854
and we're being present
with those feelings.

26:45.937 --> 26:46.938
Okay.

26:49.065 --> 26:55.780
I wish I and every woman
could be more confident in themselves.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.619
Oh, I'm so nervous.

27:00.702 --> 27:01.870
Yeah.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.581
And I just want…

27:06.541 --> 27:10.503
little girls who are in ballet classes,
who have angry French teachers,

27:10.587 --> 27:14.716
to look at themselves
in the mirror in a leotard

27:14.799 --> 27:16.676
and just love themselves,

27:16.760 --> 27:22.932
because I've always struggled
with looking at myself in the mirror

27:23.016 --> 27:25.852
and saying with absolute confidence
that I am beautiful,

27:25.935 --> 27:28.355
because I… I don't believe that,

27:29.314 --> 27:30.273
and I want to.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.524
[Darshana] This is my body.

27:31.608 --> 27:32.692
[exhales] Okay.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.072
[Darshana] This is my body.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.824
It's a precious vessel.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.160
-You can give me that.
-Thank you.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.250
[Darshana] Yeah.

27:50.752 --> 27:53.672
It is a form
of exposure therapy, you know,

27:53.755 --> 27:57.759
a gentle, loving exposure therapy
to do mirror work,

27:57.842 --> 28:02.389
because you are being exposed
to your own voice of judgment,

28:02.472 --> 28:05.433
and criticism,
and shame, and condemnation,

28:05.517 --> 28:07.268
and you need to meet that.

28:07.977 --> 28:11.815
"What is it that I don't like?"
And really name the thing, you know?

28:11.898 --> 28:15.610
Like, "Well, I'm kind of…
I see I have asymmetry." Right?

28:15.694 --> 28:18.321
So, one boob sits
differently than the other.

28:18.405 --> 28:22.117
That conversation is happening
whether we know it or not.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.327
When we're in our most sexiest time,

28:24.411 --> 28:27.580
when someone is there
in devotion to us, trying to worship us,

28:27.664 --> 28:30.625
and we're like, "Eh, don't look at that."

28:30.709 --> 28:32.001
It sits differently.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.087
So, that's the first thing you do.

28:34.170 --> 28:38.675
And as I start to go
through this process, I realize,

28:38.758 --> 28:43.847
so much of that is what someone else
told me I was supposed to look like.

28:43.930 --> 28:49.269
What did you think of Amina
getting all naked in front of the mirror?

28:49.352 --> 28:53.398
What I realized as I was watching it,
I started to track my own thoughts.

28:53.481 --> 28:58.111
Like, "I can't believe she's doing this,"
and seeing her grieving that

28:58.194 --> 29:01.573
her breasts didn't look
the way they used to,

29:01.656 --> 29:03.908
and she didn't like her stomach,

29:03.992 --> 29:07.996
but then bringing
this very deep acceptance

29:08.079 --> 29:12.459
of what happens to the body
as we age, after we have children.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.170
And I feel like the next phase
of work in my life

29:15.253 --> 29:17.255
has to be around real acceptance,

29:17.338 --> 29:23.511
because I drive myself really hard
to not age and to not,

29:23.595 --> 29:25.555
you know,
be disappointed in the way I look,

29:25.638 --> 29:28.099
and I'm still disappointed
in the way I look, you know?

29:28.183 --> 29:33.772
So it was actually very interesting
to watch that and then observe my reaction

29:33.855 --> 29:38.902
and kind of come to these conclusions
about how hard I am on myself still,

29:38.985 --> 29:42.113
and how hard we are,
as women, on our bodies

29:42.197 --> 29:44.908
and what happens to us naturally
as we go through life.

29:44.991 --> 29:45.825
Yeah.

29:45.909 --> 29:51.456
Growing up, I was an athlete and I was,
um, just skinny and muscular, always.

29:51.539 --> 29:56.920
And, I mean, as I get… As anyone
that can get older, they can gain weight.

29:57.003 --> 29:58.379
And I've had, like, my…

29:59.214 --> 30:04.302
One family member that kind of was like,
"Oh, you've gotten a little bit thicker."

30:04.385 --> 30:08.097
And comments like that,
it's just, like, kind of brings you down.

30:08.181 --> 30:12.352
What's a part of your body that
you feel the most uncomfortable about?

30:13.061 --> 30:14.479
-Definitely my waist.
-Okay.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.649
Yeah. And starting
more of the wrinkles too,

30:17.732 --> 30:20.944
but yeah, my waist,
which I've never had… one.

30:21.027 --> 30:24.614
Okay. So, we can acknowledge
the wrinkles and the waist? Right?

30:24.697 --> 30:26.491
You look at yourself and realize, like,

30:26.574 --> 30:30.161
"Okay, the wrinkles are coming.
Like, they're coming in."

30:30.245 --> 30:32.455
But what does that really signify?

30:32.539 --> 30:34.958
-An experienced woman. [laughs]
-Yeah. Like--

30:35.041 --> 30:37.669
-I, you know, earned these wrinkles.
-Yeah.

30:37.752 --> 30:40.088
So you acknowledge,
"This is the thing I don't like,

30:40.171 --> 30:42.131
-but this is what I really do like."
-Mm-hmm.

30:42.215 --> 30:44.884
When I met you, I was a lot thinner.

30:45.426 --> 30:47.262
But… This is happiness.

30:47.345 --> 30:50.849
-I still love every single part of you.
-[Darshana] This is happiness!

30:50.932 --> 30:52.392
-Oh. I love it.
-[Shandra] Right here.

30:52.475 --> 30:55.770
It's like I'm reminded
that I'm powerful as a woman,

30:55.854 --> 30:58.106
-and I've birthed two children.
-Mm-hmm.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.900
And that's a function
of this belly, you know?

31:00.984 --> 31:04.946
And also, you're still very strong
and fit, you're still swimming.

31:05.029 --> 31:08.157
"So then I'm also able to power
through water with this belly,

31:08.241 --> 31:11.035
and I think it actually
looks good in places."

31:11.119 --> 31:14.539
So you start looking at places where,
"Yeah, this part's sticking out,

31:14.622 --> 31:16.291
but what… Do I like this part more?"

31:16.374 --> 31:22.171
But it starts here, just staring
in the mirror, and really just looking.

31:22.255 --> 31:25.133
How often do you get a chance
to just look at yourself?

31:25.216 --> 31:28.219
I mean, this process was
a lot about, obviously, Camille and I,

31:28.303 --> 31:30.346
and, like, looking into her eyes,

31:30.430 --> 31:33.933
but today, like, in the mirror was
the first time I, like, looked at mine.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.435
[laughs]

31:36.311 --> 31:37.228
Whoo.

31:37.937 --> 31:39.230
It gave me a boost,

31:39.314 --> 31:44.861
and I'm getting emotional now 'cause
I'm talking about it, but it was a…

31:46.154 --> 31:47.697
It was just a boost of confidence.

31:47.780 --> 31:51.826
That negativity was
just completely gone today.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.412
[Darshana]
"I love you, curves." Like, you can find…

31:54.495 --> 31:59.626
Shandra having this surge
of confidence and self-love,

32:00.251 --> 32:02.253
it shows us what is possible here,

32:02.337 --> 32:04.672
and Camille's experience is just as valid,

32:04.756 --> 32:10.511
that it might not be instantaneous
and it might take a lot more encouragement

32:10.595 --> 32:12.972
and reinforcement and nurturing

32:13.056 --> 32:15.975
to get to a place
where she can feel peace with herself.

32:16.976 --> 32:23.232
Women in particular are taught
to deny their sexual desire,

32:23.316 --> 32:26.694
or to at least not speak about it,
not frankly.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.738
This is where I'm at. This looks good.

32:28.821 --> 32:34.619
In the mirror work, that is really
where I saw the biggest shift for Joie.

32:35.244 --> 32:40.750
I think it's inspiring,
and a confident body speaks volumes.

32:41.376 --> 32:45.755
I needed for her to feel
more grounded and settled and safe

32:46.422 --> 32:48.132
to express her desires.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.970
[Joie] So, what did you think of today?

32:52.804 --> 32:53.972
[Mike] It was fun.

32:54.055 --> 32:58.059
[Joie] Right. Doing some things
outside the comfort zone,

32:58.142 --> 33:00.645
-even along the lines with foreplay.
-Mm-hmm.

33:00.728 --> 33:05.233
[Joie] And foreplay doesn't
always have to end in the act.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.527
But just spending more time,

33:07.610 --> 33:10.989
not being in a hurry to go to sleep,

33:11.072 --> 33:16.661
or even lovemaking
as a form of falling asleep.

33:17.620 --> 33:18.788
[Mike] I'm good with that.

33:19.455 --> 33:22.875
Really, a lot of the work that I do,
it's about moving you into a space

33:22.959 --> 33:26.796
where you're communicating
what's uncomfortable to communicate.

33:26.879 --> 33:31.592
"Really, what I want is my butt rubbed
a little bit before we get to the sex."

33:31.676 --> 33:34.637
[Joie] Working out like more of a massage,

33:34.721 --> 33:39.809
'cause I think we both enjoy a massage
and we don't take time to do it.

33:39.892 --> 33:43.646
[Mike] And then have
that perhaps be the prelude

33:43.730 --> 33:47.692
to, you know, some more
intimacy and some hot sex.

33:47.775 --> 33:48.985
[Joie] Okay.

33:49.068 --> 33:55.366
So, at the end when I hear Joie say,
"I want more foreplay,"

33:55.450 --> 33:57.160
I'm like, "Ah, it worked."

33:57.660 --> 33:59.495
It was eye-opening in the sense that

33:59.579 --> 34:03.875
we're always in a hurry
to go to bed and have sex,

34:03.958 --> 34:07.045
and maybe not all foreplay
needs to occur in bed.

34:10.673 --> 34:12.091
[whispering] Your boobs look great.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.176
[laughs] Thank you.

34:14.927 --> 34:15.762
[Camille] They do.

34:15.845 --> 34:16.929
Today, I realized

34:17.013 --> 34:22.268
you need to be comfortable
or at least be in tune with yourself first

34:22.351 --> 34:24.937
before you can even bring
somebody else into the equation.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.315
And I guess I need
to work on myself a lot.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.025
A lot more than I thought I did.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.486
This has brought up a lot of things

34:31.569 --> 34:35.948
that we can just even
go home and talk about tonight,

34:36.032 --> 34:38.910
and then bring it again tomorrow and…

34:38.993 --> 34:40.286
'Cause we're not done. [laughs]

34:41.329 --> 34:42.997
-Here we go.
-Oh, thank you.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.207
[all chuckling]

34:45.124 --> 34:49.045
[mellow string music playing]
