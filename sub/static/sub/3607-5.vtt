WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:11.678
Stay down.

00:20.771 --> 00:24.691
Your choice, man. Walk away now,
you won't get your ass kicked.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.535
You should've stayed down, Jack.

00:35.619 --> 00:38.788
Jack! Jack!

00:44.586 --> 00:46.003
There's someone out there!

00:46.088 --> 00:47.964
- The current!
- What?

00:48.048 --> 00:50.800
There's someone out there! Look!

00:51.719 --> 00:53.553
- Help!
- I woke up, and she's...

00:53.637 --> 00:57.140
I don't swim. I don't swim.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.694
You're OK.

01:51.779 --> 01:55.865
Just deep breaths now.
Come on, just breathe.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.826
Just breathe. Yeah.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.997
Did you get her?

02:03.081 --> 02:05.208
What?

02:06.043 --> 02:08.211
There was a woman. I was trying...

02:08.294 --> 02:10.588
Did you get her?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.550
Help!

02:15.803 --> 02:18.387
- We gotta go back.
- Help!

02:24.561 --> 02:31.567
Come on.

02:46.291 --> 02:50.086
- Jack!
- There's someone else still out there.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.067
So, what'd they say?

03:55.652 --> 03:58.154
- Jack, maybe you should...
- Who was she?

04:00.449 --> 04:02.867
Her name was Joanna.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.953
She wasn't supposed
to be on the plane.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.498
She was scuba diving off the
Barrier Reef and got an ear infection

04:09.583 --> 04:12.585
and so the doctor grounded her
for two days.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.629
She bumped her flight.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.464
That's how she ended up with us.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.216
She was just swimming this morning.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.887
Got caught in the riptide.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.892
We've been here six days. I never
talked to her. Never said a word.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.770
- Don't...
- There are 47 of us. Never said a word.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.855
- You tried.
- No, I didn't.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.776
I thought maybe I could...

04:36.860 --> 04:39.987
I thought I could bring him back
and still have the time.

04:40.072 --> 04:44.158
I was there... in the water.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.244
I didn't try.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.665
I decided not to go after her.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.890
Are you OK?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.934
- Did you see that?
- What?

05:10.018 --> 05:12.520
Standing there in the water,
there was a man.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.066
You didn't see that?

05:18.068 --> 05:20.444
Jack, when was
the last time you slept?

05:26.660 --> 05:29.662
I need to put this
with the rest of the gear.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.631
Who taught you that?

05:41.258 --> 05:43.926
Sun. The Korean lady.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.347
- Don't swallow it.
- Why not?

05:48.432 --> 05:51.726
- Ocean water will make you thirsty.
- Why?

05:54.146 --> 05:56.564
Just don't swallow it, man.
All right?

07:12.099 --> 07:14.266
Have you got it or what?

07:14.351 --> 07:15.893
You're in my light, sticks.

07:15.977 --> 07:20.523
- What the hell is that supposed to...?
- Light. Comma. Sticks.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.775
As in, those legs of yours.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.736
While I love my new nickname
and I think it's sweet...

07:25.821 --> 07:27.947
Calm down.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.406
I got your damn stuff.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.786
- It'll keep off sand fleas?
- You bet.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.247
Even has aloe.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.792
How much?

07:40.544 --> 07:44.213
- Your money's no good here.
- Then what the hell do you want?

07:47.384 --> 07:49.927
- If you really think I...
- Five grand.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.388
I thought you said my money
was no good here.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.431
I was negotiating.

07:54.516 --> 07:58.602
I can take an IOU.
Something tells me you're good...

07:58.687 --> 08:00.604
...for it.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.706
You haven't found a hairbrush
in there, have you?

08:18.790 --> 08:20.040
No. Sorry.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.501
God, I must've looked
through 20 suitcases.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.920
Can't find one.
It's weird, right?

08:25.005 --> 08:28.174
I mean, you'd think that
everyone packs a hairbrush...

08:30.552 --> 08:34.263
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's just the heat.

08:35.932 --> 08:39.434
- And I'm pregnant.
- Really?

08:40.395 --> 08:42.104
Thanks.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.608
What are you doing?

08:45.692 --> 08:50.196
I'm sorting the practical clothes
from the impractical.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.574
- Wanna help?
- Sure.

08:54.409 --> 08:57.828
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure. Shoot.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.830
Are you a Gemini?

09:02.542 --> 09:05.044
- Yeah, I am.
- I thought so.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.630
Restless. Passionate.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.549
Everyone thinks astrology
is just a load of crap,

09:10.634 --> 09:12.676
but that's because they don't get it.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.471
I could do your chart if you wanted.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.599
Or not.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.852
Geminis.

09:31.947 --> 09:34.323
You look tired, brother.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.784
I'm fine. What's up?

09:36.868 --> 09:38.869
We've got a problem.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.539
- That's it?
- That's it.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.625
- How many?
- Eighteen.

09:44.709 --> 09:50.589
People just kinda took what they needed
'cause we were supposed to be rescued.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.007
But we weren't.

09:52.092 --> 09:56.220
Even if we divvied it up,
it wouldn't be enough for 47 people.

09:56.304 --> 10:00.474
Forty-six.
There's 46 of us now.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.769
If people find out this is
all we have, they'll freak out.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.897
The boar's running low.
What should we tell them?

10:06.982 --> 10:09.650
- I don't know.
- Make water-finding sticks.

10:09.734 --> 10:13.320
- What should we do with stuff we got?
- I don't know.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.617
- We should put it in the tent, yeah?
- Maybe the dog can find water.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.911
Better if no one
knows how little is left.

10:20.996 --> 10:24.206
Dogs can find pot and bombs,
so I'm sure they can find water.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.917
We tell the others we're running low,
we can ration it.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.962
- Then you can decide...
- I'm not deciding anything!

10:31.298 --> 10:33.090
Why not?

10:49.190 --> 10:51.400
You wanna come in?

11:02.037 --> 11:04.288
So...

11:04.372 --> 11:07.082
You wanna tell me what happened?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.126
A couple of guys
jumped Marc Silverman.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.546
A couple of guys
jumped Marc Silverman?

11:12.630 --> 11:15.341
But they didn't jump you.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.760
No.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.560
I had a boy on my table today.

11:26.644 --> 11:30.105
I don't know, maybe
a year younger than you.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.358
He had a bad heart.

11:32.442 --> 11:35.361
It got real hairy, real fast.

11:35.445 --> 11:38.197
Everybody's looking
to your old man to make decisions.

11:38.281 --> 11:44.119
And I was able to make those decisions
because at the end of the day,

11:44.204 --> 11:48.707
after the boy died,
I was able to wash my hands

11:48.792 --> 11:52.211
and come home to dinner,

11:52.295 --> 11:56.548
you know, watch a little Carol Burnett,
laugh till my sides hurt.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.134
And how can I do that?

11:59.803 --> 12:04.640
I mean, even when I fail,
how do I do that, Jack?

12:07.185 --> 12:09.978
Because I have what it takes.

12:11.981 --> 12:16.193
Don't choose, Jack. Don't decide.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.407
You don't wanna be a hero. You don't
wanna try and save everyone.

12:21.491 --> 12:25.494
Because when you fail...

12:29.249 --> 12:32.334
You just don't have what it takes.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.968
Why didn't you leave me?

12:42.887 --> 12:45.097
Hey, I'm talking to you.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.686
- Not now, man.
- I could have made it back.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.023
What? You're not gonna answer me?

12:55.108 --> 12:58.193
- I told you to leave me.
- You were drowning.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.990
- You should've saved her.
- But I didn't save her.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.617
And neither did you.

13:05.702 --> 13:09.371
You think you're all noble and heroic
for coming after me? I was fine.

13:09.456 --> 13:14.585
You're not the only one who knows what
to do around here. I run a business.

13:14.669 --> 13:18.755
Who appointed you our savior, huh?

13:18.840 --> 13:22.301
What gives you the right? Look at me.

13:22.385 --> 13:25.262
Hey, I'm talking to you.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.723
Look at me, Jack.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.850
Where are you going?

13:31.394 --> 13:33.770
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

14:10.892 --> 14:12.434
Dad?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.746
Your father's gone, Jack.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.918
Did you hear what I said?

14:39.546 --> 14:40.879
He's gone, Jack.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.760
- He'll be back.
- This time it's different.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.848
I want you to bring him back.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.397
- What?
- He hasn't talked to me in two months.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.399
You haven't talked
to him in two months.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.734
He doesn't want me
to bring him back. Trust me.

15:02.819 --> 15:06.738
- Let one of his friends.
- He doesn't have friends anymore.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.240
Why do you think that is?

15:11.869 --> 15:13.662
He was right about you.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.249
Right about what?

15:17.333 --> 15:21.503
- You don't understand the pressure...
- I understand pressure.

15:25.216 --> 15:29.094
Jack, please, you know how he gets.
He doesn't...

15:29.178 --> 15:33.181
He won't take care of himself.
You have to go after him.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.351
I'm sorry.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.438
I can't.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.274
"I can't"?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.696
You don't get to say "I can't."

15:47.780 --> 15:50.532
Not after what you did.

15:55.705 --> 15:59.082
You bring your father home, Jack.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.260
Where is he?

16:13.222 --> 16:15.390
Australia.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.823
- What's the matter?
- That pregnant lady fell down.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.205
- What happened?
- She just dropped.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.165
It must be the heat.
Is she breathing?

16:40.249 --> 16:41.583
I think.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.293
Come on, let's get her inside.

16:49.467 --> 16:53.220
Claire? Claire, honey, wake up.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.138
Claire, can you hear me? Claire?

16:55.223 --> 16:57.557
Come on, wake up. Come on.

16:57.642 --> 17:00.268
Come on, please wake up. Come on.

17:00.353 --> 17:04.146
Claire, can you hear me?
Hi, it's me, it's Kate.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.691
- What...?
- You passed out.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.652
Just take it easy, OK?
She needs water.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.278
- Water.
- Don't move, OK?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.616
She's burning up. She's really hot.
Honey, I think you have a fever.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.452
You need to stay really still. It's OK.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.497
- Just rest.
- What the...?

17:21.624 --> 17:24.041
The water's gone.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.088
Someone stole it.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.384
- Where is the doctor?
- I don't know. No one can find him.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.512
Was this the last
of the camp's water supply?

17:35.596 --> 17:37.639
Keeping it all in one place, foolish.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.850
I can go into the jungle
to find fresh water.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.184
You're not going alone.

17:41.269 --> 17:44.354
When the others find out the
water's gone, it's gonna get ugly.

17:44.439 --> 17:48.650
And when they find out that someone
pinched it, it's gonna get uglier.

17:51.654 --> 17:55.949
I'll go. Camp needs you two here.
Especially with the doctor gone.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.662
And besides, I know where to look.

18:39.368 --> 18:50.712
Where are you?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.091
Where are you?!

18:55.176 --> 18:58.970
The maid says he hasn't used
the bed in the past three days.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.523
- Did he rent a car from the concierge?
- No, sir.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.902
Quite honestly, Mr. Shephard,

19:13.986 --> 19:17.405
I don't think
your father rented a car at all.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.865
Yeah? Why's that?

19:18.950 --> 19:22.118
There was an incident a few nights ago,
here at the hotel bar.

19:22.203 --> 19:25.622
I had to get security
to escort your father to his room.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.416
What's that have to do
with renting a car?

19:28.501 --> 19:30.043
Sorry. I shouldn't have...

19:30.127 --> 19:32.671
What's that have to do
with renting a car?

19:33.297 --> 19:35.715
I don't think
any rental agent in Sydney

19:35.800 --> 19:38.051
would lease your father
a car in his condition.

19:38.135 --> 19:41.137
My father is the chief of surgery.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.807
Of course, sir. I apologize.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.608
He left his wallet.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.989
Who leaves a wallet?

19:59.073 --> 20:02.200
Perhaps you should talk
to the police, Mr. Shephard.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.248
Where are you?

22:02.071 --> 22:04.489
Take my hand.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.121
Come on.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.269
You OK?

22:52.955 --> 22:59.044
Hey.

22:59.837 --> 23:04.007
- How long have I...?
- A couple of hours. Here.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.844
It's not much,
but it's what we have.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.598
Just relax.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.726
You have to think
about the little one now, yeah?

23:14.810 --> 23:17.520
Thanks for the water, Charlie.

23:17.897 --> 23:21.066
There'd be more
if some git hadn't nicked it.

23:22.068 --> 23:25.153
- Is Jack back yet?
- No.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.489
No one's seen him.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.953
But I wouldn't worry.

23:34.038 --> 23:37.123
Good ol' Mr. Locke's gone into
the jungle to get some water for you.

23:37.208 --> 23:40.376
Great. Our only hunter's
gonna get eaten

23:40.461 --> 23:43.129
just so he can get the
pregnant girl some more water.

23:43.214 --> 23:46.883
I wouldn't worry. You tell me, who
would you rather meet in a dark alley,

23:46.967 --> 23:50.345
whatever's out there, or that
geezer with his 400 knives?

23:50.429 --> 23:53.098
I mean, who packs 400 knives?

23:53.182 --> 23:57.560
Personally, I can only have space
for 200. Three hundred, at most.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.735
When are they gonna rescue us?

24:08.030 --> 24:10.198
Soon.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.994
- Thanks, Charlie.
- For what?

24:15.079 --> 24:18.706
People don't seem
to look me in the eye here.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.667
I think I scare them.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.752
The baby.

24:22.837 --> 24:27.966
It's like I'm this time bomb of
responsibility just waiting to go off.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.681
You don't scare me.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.360
The Chinese people have water.

24:50.739 --> 24:56.077
Where did you get this?

24:57.788 --> 25:01.124
- Where did you get...?
- She doesn't understand, Sayid.

25:01.208 --> 25:04.085
She understands me.
Did you steal this water?

25:11.510 --> 25:15.763
OK, just take it easy. All right?
We just want to talk, all right?

25:15.848 --> 25:18.016
This had water in it. Is it yours?

25:21.729 --> 25:24.439
Who gave you this?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.157
I don't see the water.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.659
- And?
- You go after him now,

25:36.744 --> 25:39.913
he'll give you nothing.
But if you wait...

25:39.997 --> 25:43.291
A rat will always lead you to its hole.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.692
- Well, it's about time.
- For what?

26:09.777 --> 26:11.736
I made this birthday wish
four years ago.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.613
Where's the water?

26:18.160 --> 26:20.119
- That's better.
- Get off of me.

26:22.998 --> 26:26.084
- Give us the water now!
- Yeah, touch me again, huh?

26:26.168 --> 26:28.253
You really think
I stoled your damn water?

26:28.337 --> 26:31.923
- You gave two bottles to the Koreans.
- I don't give nothing to nobody.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.676
- It's not here.
- I traded Mr. Miyagi

26:34.760 --> 26:36.761
the last of my water
for a fish he caught.

26:36.845 --> 26:40.598
- We worked it out caveman-style.
- You gave him your last two bottles?

26:40.683 --> 26:44.769
Water has no value, Freckles.
It's gonna rain sooner or later.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.814
And hell, I'm an optimist.

26:59.827 --> 27:03.371
Hey. You forgot something.

27:04.039 --> 27:08.418
Seeing as you're the new sheriff in
town, might as well make it official.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.428
How are they?

27:19.388 --> 27:22.682
- The others.
- Thirsty.

27:23.726 --> 27:26.769
Hungry. Waiting to be rescued.

27:26.854 --> 27:30.189
And they need someone
to tell them what to do.

27:30.274 --> 27:32.400
Me?

27:35.029 --> 27:37.322
- I can't.
- Why can't you?

27:37.406 --> 27:41.200
- Because I'm not a leader.
- And yet they all treat you like one.

27:41.285 --> 27:43.786
I don't know how to help them.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.872
I'll fail, I'll...

27:47.082 --> 27:49.417
I don't have what it takes.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.546
Why are you out here, Jack?

27:56.216 --> 28:00.053
- I think I'm going crazy.
- Oh, you're not going crazy.

28:00.137 --> 28:01.179
No?

28:01.263 --> 28:05.683
Crazy people don't know they're going
crazy. They think they're getting saner.

28:06.769 --> 28:09.103
So...

28:10.314 --> 28:12.148
...why are you out here?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.987
I'm chasing something.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.074
Someone.

28:22.326 --> 28:23.951
The White Rabbit.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.079
Alice in Wonderland.

28:26.163 --> 28:29.916
Yeah, Wonderland,
because who I'm chasing...

28:31.043 --> 28:32.293
...he's not there.

28:32.378 --> 28:35.421
- But you see him?
- Yes.

28:35.506 --> 28:37.423
But he's not there.

28:38.342 --> 28:41.052
And if I came to you
and said the same thing,

28:41.136 --> 28:43.888
then what would your explanation be?
As a doctor.

28:43.972 --> 28:46.057
I'd call it a hallucination.

28:46.141 --> 28:49.268
Result of dehydration.
Post-traumatic stress.

28:49.353 --> 28:52.605
Not getting more than two hours
of sleep a night. All of the above.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.774
All right, then. You're hallucinating.

28:56.026 --> 28:59.862
- But what if you're not?
- Then we're all in a lot of trouble.

29:05.536 --> 29:07.578
I'm an ordinary man, Jack.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.789
Meat and potatoes.
I live in the real world.

29:09.873 --> 29:13.584
Not a big believer in... magic.

29:15.045 --> 29:18.005
But this place is different.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.384
It's special.

29:21.844 --> 29:25.680
The others don't want to talk
about it because it scares them.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.933
But we all know it. We all feel it.

29:29.977 --> 29:33.354
Is your White Rabbit a hallucination?
Probably.

29:33.439 --> 29:39.110
But what if everything
that happened here

29:39.194 --> 29:41.320
happened for a reason?

29:42.030 --> 29:45.867
What if this person
that you're chasing is really here?

29:45.951 --> 29:50.121
- That's impossible.
- Even if it is, let's say it's not.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.127
Then what happens when I catch him?

29:56.211 --> 29:58.754
I don't know.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.884
But I've looked
into the eye of this island.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.386
And what I saw...

30:08.557 --> 30:10.850
...was beautiful.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.693
- Wait, where are you going?
- To find some more water.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.153
- I'll come with you.
- No.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.071
You need to finish what you started.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.158
Why?

30:27.242 --> 30:31.954
Because a leader can't lead
until he knows where he's going.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.822
The police found him
in an alley in Kings Cross.

31:06.907 --> 31:09.534
Our tox screen showed
a blood alcohol content

31:09.618 --> 31:14.080
which, for a man of his size, probably
brought on myocardial infarction:

31:14.164 --> 31:17.542
A sizeable and fatal heart attack.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.995
That's him.

34:30.152 --> 34:35.364
...Oceanic Airlines, flight 125 nonstop
to Singapore, leaving from gate 14...

34:35.449 --> 34:37.574
What do you mean
you won't put it on the plane?

34:37.659 --> 34:40.202
I'm sorry, Mr. Shephard,
but our policy is that the body

34:40.286 --> 34:43.371
must have the proper documentation.
There is no latitude to...

34:43.456 --> 34:44.915
No latitude? No latitude?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.835
- Without the proper documents...
- You can't do this to me.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.588
- I'm ready to go now.
- Perhaps another carrier...

34:50.672 --> 34:52.547
No!

34:57.763 --> 35:01.724
I want you to listen to me. OK?
Because I'm asking you a favor.

35:01.808 --> 35:06.145
Chrissy, I'm standing
in front of you in the same suit

35:06.229 --> 35:10.775
that I'm wearing to my father's funeral
and I'm asking you a favor.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.944
In 16 hours I need to land at LAX.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.946
And I need that coffin to clear customs

35:16.031 --> 35:18.449
because there is gonna
be a hearse waiting there.

35:18.533 --> 35:23.537
And I need that hearse to take me and
that coffin to a cemetery. Why, Chrissy?

35:23.622 --> 35:26.916
Why can't I bring him to a funeral
home and make all the arrangements?

35:27.000 --> 35:30.127
Why can't I really take
my time with it? Because...

35:30.212 --> 35:33.589
Because I need it to be done.

35:33.673 --> 35:36.133
I need it to be over.

35:38.303 --> 35:42.890
I just... I need to bury my father.

37:12.647 --> 37:15.816
Hey, hey, Claire.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.656
How did you get...?

37:24.826 --> 37:27.036
Where'd you get that?

37:27.871 --> 37:29.914
- Here's your thief.
- Where'd he hide it?

37:29.998 --> 37:32.249
I don't know,
but this wanker had three bottles.

37:32.334 --> 37:34.001
Why did you do it, pretty boy?

37:34.085 --> 37:37.963
It was just sitting... it was just
sitting in the tent. Jack just took off.

37:38.048 --> 37:40.633
- Claire could've died.
- I tried to give her some sooner.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.384
It got out of hand.

37:42.469 --> 37:45.012
- What is going on?
- Someone had to take responsibility.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.764
- Forty would never...
- Shut up!

37:46.848 --> 37:49.308
Leave him alone!

38:00.528 --> 38:05.407
It's been six days
and we're all still waiting.

38:06.576 --> 38:08.869
Waiting for someone to come.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.373
But what if they don't?

38:18.755 --> 38:21.256
We have to stop waiting.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.595
We need to start figuring things out.

38:27.764 --> 38:31.183
A woman died this morning
just going for a swim.

38:31.267 --> 38:35.229
And he tried to save her
and now you're about to crucify him?

38:37.232 --> 38:39.608
We can't do this.

38:39.693 --> 38:42.444
"Every man for himself"
is not gonna work.

38:45.657 --> 38:48.325
It's time to start organizing.

38:48.410 --> 38:51.870
We need to figure out
how we're gonna survive here.

38:54.457 --> 38:58.669
Now I found water,
fresh water, up in the valley.

39:00.130 --> 39:03.173
I'll take a group in at first light.
If you don't wanna come,

39:03.258 --> 39:06.510
then find another way to contribute.

39:09.389 --> 39:13.142
Last week, most of us were strangers.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.187
But we're all here now.

39:17.272 --> 39:20.566
And God knows how long
we're gonna be here.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.280
But if we can't live together,

39:28.700 --> 39:31.118
we're gonna die alone.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.706
So how's it feel?

40:18.458 --> 40:20.876
How's what feel?

40:20.960 --> 40:23.921
Taking my place at the top
of everyone's most hated list.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.511
It sucks, don't it?

40:44.734 --> 40:46.944
Thanks.

40:53.368 --> 40:56.537
So where were you today, Jack?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.544
Just had to take care of a few things.

41:07.340 --> 41:09.716
That's all I'm gonna get, huh?

41:13.721 --> 41:16.265
My father died.

41:16.349 --> 41:18.934
In Sydney.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.189
I'm sorry.

41:27.443 --> 41:29.736
Yeah.

41:30.905 --> 41:33.282
I'm sorry too.
