00:35.001 --> 00:36.301
Order up, Jess!

00:44.313 --> 00:45.950
Blue plate and a hot dog?

00:45.985 --> 00:49.047
I think I put in a grilled cheese
and a wedge salad.

00:49.115 --> 00:51.349
Thank you, Cal.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.528
Here we go.

01:10.337 --> 01:13.471
- Wrong table, hon.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:13.506 --> 01:14.506
Okay.

01:14.541 --> 01:17.175
Hi. Enjoy.

01:17.210 --> 01:21.379
Oh, my gosh, I just got a new
prescription. It's driving me nuts.

01:21.448 --> 01:22.614
I got your back.

01:22.649 --> 01:25.817
- Can you take this to table six?
- Sure.

01:25.852 --> 01:27.952
- That way.
- Okay.

01:27.988 --> 01:30.521
Excuse me, please,
but I'm waiting?

01:30.590 --> 01:34.192
I am so sorry, sir.
Okay.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.593
What can I get for you?

01:35.629 --> 01:38.830
Double-burger with fries,
extra pickles, cupcakes,

01:38.865 --> 01:41.666
and a mega-gulp soda.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.167
You know our policy, sir.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.503
If it's not on the menu,
then it's not on the plate.

01:45.538 --> 01:46.838
But you run the place!

01:46.873 --> 01:49.507
I know, I'm sorry. It was
always my grandpa's rule,

01:49.542 --> 01:51.120
and if it's good enough for him,
then it's good enough for me.

01:51.144 --> 01:52.677
Aw, mom.

01:55.081 --> 01:58.316
How was school?
Did my Graham-Cracker flashcards help?

01:58.351 --> 02:03.354
- Well, I aced my math test!
- Yeah? That's great!

02:03.423 --> 02:07.358
Why don't we celebrate
with milk and more flashcards?

02:07.427 --> 02:11.162
Jess, don't look now,
but I think your ex is on TV again.

02:11.197 --> 02:15.366
Chase? I don't think a high-school
boyfriend qualifies as an "ex".

02:15.435 --> 02:17.302
Wesley's dad is "ex" enough.

02:17.337 --> 02:20.138
Look, they're playing Chase's clip
again, from the seventh game.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.739
This never gets old.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.776
<i>...after losing
the seventh game of the series,</i>

02:24.811 --> 02:27.145
<i>with many blaming pitcher
Chase Taynor for the defeat.</i>

02:27.180 --> 02:31.015
<i>Once a star on the mound,
Taynor is now a man without a team,</i>

02:31.084 --> 02:34.919
<i>and many are wondering
if anyone will pick up his contract,</i>

02:34.955 --> 02:37.333
<i>with just two weeks remaining
before the new season starts.</i>

02:37.357 --> 02:40.658
- I feel bad for the guy.
- Oh, come on!

02:40.694 --> 02:43.628
<i>Chase. Chase.
Just a few questions?</i>

02:43.663 --> 02:47.265
<i>Have you gotten over giving up the
grand slam in game seven of the series?</i>

02:47.300 --> 02:49.834
<i>Yeah, my apologies go out
to the fans, and my teammates,</i>

02:49.903 --> 02:52.581
<i>but I got a short memory.
Already thinking about next season.</i>

02:52.605 --> 02:54.906
Miss supermodel
sure doesn't look too happy.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.941
<i>Are you worried about
contract negotiations?</i>

02:56.977 --> 02:58.109
<i>No. Not at all.</i>

02:58.144 --> 03:00.578
Man, the media is really
just hounding him.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.013
Yeah, I know.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.759
<i>That's what sport's all about.
I gotcha there.</i>

03:03.783 --> 03:06.117
Chase always did
love the spotlight.

03:06.152 --> 03:07.752
<i>Okay, guys, thanks.
No more questions.</i>

03:07.787 --> 03:08.853
He still looks great.

03:08.922 --> 03:12.357
Empty restaurant,
staff glued to the TV...

03:12.425 --> 03:14.425
Wesley, hon', let's get
that order to go.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.260
Come on.
Time for baseball practice.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.434
All right.
Here we go. Are you ready?

03:23.470 --> 03:24.769
And...

03:24.804 --> 03:26.237
Swing!

03:27.907 --> 03:29.440
Okay. Just...

03:29.476 --> 03:32.777
Let me see if we need to make
any adjustments.

03:32.812 --> 03:37.515
Okay, so what you need to do is just...
Choke up on the bat.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.450
Like some kid on the Internet?

03:39.486 --> 03:42.820
Hey, look!
His mom's teaching him!

03:43.957 --> 03:45.423
I'm gonna go get some water.

03:53.733 --> 03:59.070
Okay. I can't decide between
this blue dress and the black one?

03:59.105 --> 04:00.973
- You're going with Brett, right?
- Yes.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.674
- Then orange.
- Orange?

04:03.743 --> 04:05.703
You said that orange
makes me look like a pumpkin.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.847
Stop.
Brett is a nice guy.

04:09.916 --> 04:10.916
Come here.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.521
You know I'm not trying
to replace your dad, right?

04:16.555 --> 04:19.089
I would never do that.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.929
I love you.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.266
Be nice.
Brett's here.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.068
I'm off to the Spring Fling
planning meeting.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.503
Have fun with Bonnie
while I'm gone.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.648
Sorry, I know this was date night,

04:43.716 --> 04:47.151
but at least we're even
for the insurance convention.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.953
At least we had a Hawaiian theme.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.789
True.
You've got me there.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.425
I've sold insurance
to half the people here.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.661
I should go say hi to some folks.

04:56.729 --> 05:00.965
Spring's prime time to top up coverage
before tornado and cicada season hit.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.601
- Network away.
- Thank you.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.837
Hello, Jessica.

05:05.905 --> 05:09.774
- Good to see you, Charlie.
- You too, Jessica. How's business?

05:09.809 --> 05:11.742
Well, it was better
before you opened up

05:11.778 --> 05:13.444
your restaurant
next to the highway.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.547
You know, I always thought that
Parker Falls needed another restaurant.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.216
You know, something new.

05:18.251 --> 05:22.286
Besides, a little friendly competition
just helps everyone raise the bar a little.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.155
Well, thank you
for the marketing lesson.

05:24.224 --> 05:27.091
You could always relocate.
Didn't your folks move to Florida?

05:27.127 --> 05:29.594
I hear it's pretty sunny there!

05:29.629 --> 05:31.629
And besides, from what I just
heard at the bank,

05:31.664 --> 05:33.142
you missed your last payment
on your small business loan?

05:33.166 --> 05:37.268
Tell your brother I said hi.
And we're doing just fine.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.971
My grandfather opened
that diner 40 years ago

05:40.039 --> 05:43.608
and I have put my heart and soul
into keeping it open.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.076
Besides...

05:45.111 --> 05:46.811
We still have a few tricks
up our sleeves.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.154
Really?
Oh, do tell.

05:49.189 --> 05:52.083
Taco Wednesday's tomorrow,
and it's gonna be huge.

05:53.253 --> 05:55.454
Taco Wednesday?
Okay.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.656
Shouldn't it be "taco Tuesday"?

06:00.093 --> 06:02.160
If I hadn't
just thought of it now.

06:06.633 --> 06:10.935
- Don't worry, boss. It's still early.
- Taco night's a bust.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.104
"Brunch buddies" bombed.

06:13.139 --> 06:18.709
Clearly, our theme nights are not pulling
customers in, so it's on to plan "b".

06:20.246 --> 06:22.880
Or is it plan "m", at this point?
I'll think of something.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.616
- You never give up, do you?
- I can't.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.919
Took grandpa years
to save up for this place.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.955
The least I can do
is give Charlie a fight.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.875
Spence! How's my favorite agent?
You promised me something soon.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.111
And I'll deliver, buddy,
I got feelers out to a dozen teams,

06:54.147 --> 06:55.580
but this is gonna take some time.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.092
<i>Well, spring training
started without me.</i>

06:57.116 --> 06:59.651
If I don't get an offer before
the season begins, I'm finished.

06:59.719 --> 07:02.954
<i>The memory of game seven
still hasn't quite settled down.</i>

07:02.989 --> 07:06.691
Chase, when I talk to owners, you've
got a reputation for risky moves.

07:06.726 --> 07:10.239
<i>Now, look, when you're on top, people
can forgive a little ego and some swagger.</i>

07:10.263 --> 07:12.897
But, come on, let's face it, your arm
isn't exactly what it used to be.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.766
My arm is fine!
It's my ego that's taken a bruising.

07:15.802 --> 07:19.737
Just lay low for a while and stay out
of sight. Let me work my magic. Okay?

07:19.772 --> 07:22.540
Yeah, I found a good place to lay low
while things sort themselves out.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.042
That's great! You gonna hit the
beaches in Maui with that gal of yours?

07:25.078 --> 07:28.212
Nah. No, she's on a perfume shoot
in Paris for the week.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.581
<i>I'm headed home
to good old Parker Falls, Ohio.</i>

07:30.617 --> 07:32.497
You just get me an offer
before I'm toast, okay?

07:32.552 --> 07:35.553
- My fate's in your hands, bud.
- Okay, pal. Talk to you soon.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.026
Welcome home.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.474
Sorry, officer.

07:56.542 --> 08:00.911
I was, I was on a phone call.
Hands-free, of course.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.947
License, please.

08:07.186 --> 08:08.853
Chase Taynor?

08:08.888 --> 08:12.356
It's Jake. Jake Miller.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.558
I was a freshman when
you were a senior, remember?

08:14.594 --> 08:17.895
Right... yeah. Jake!

08:17.930 --> 08:20.431
Man, I haven't seen you in,
like, what, 15 years now?

08:20.466 --> 08:21.599
Well, except on T.V.

08:21.634 --> 08:24.352
Sorry about that one pitch, man.

08:24.353 --> 08:25.870
I figured you'd be
in spring training by now.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.972
Yeah. Yeah, I just...

08:28.041 --> 08:31.208
Wanted to come back home
and relax a little bit, you know?

08:31.244 --> 08:33.255
Well, good timing. Spring Fling
kicks off this week.

08:33.279 --> 08:34.912
Lucky me.

08:34.947 --> 08:38.515
Say, Chase, I gotta ask.
In game 7...

08:38.551 --> 08:41.284
Jake, were you...
Gonna write me a ticket?

08:41.354 --> 08:42.919
- Or something?
- Nah, nah.

08:42.955 --> 08:45.089
I'm gonna let you off with a
warning, for old time's sake.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.024
See you around.

08:47.060 --> 08:51.562
- And, keep that speed down, now.
- Yeah, you bet.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.729
Aw, man.

09:06.730 --> 09:10.514
Hey, Jess, do you mind if I take the rest
of afternoon off, with it being so slow?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.849
Sure.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.952
Just tell me you're not sneaking off
to Charlie's to apply for a job.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.288
No! No. I just... I need to get
these glasses adjusted.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.789
They're driving me nuts.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.959
You mind also taking this
omelette to the guy at table nine?

09:22.028 --> 09:24.061
He's the... blurry one?

09:24.097 --> 09:26.697
- I got it.
- Useless.

09:28.034 --> 09:30.534
Okay. Here is your omelette.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.842
- Chase?
- Jessica.

09:39.445 --> 09:42.546
I didn't... I didn't know
you still worked here.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.015
I didn't know
you were back in town.

09:46.686 --> 09:52.390
- How are you?
- I'm... I'm good. I'm really good.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.892
- You?
- Great.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.572
Do do you want to...
Want to have a seat?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.195
No. No, no, no, no, no.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.564
The dinner rush is gonna be here
any second and I...

10:02.235 --> 10:07.571
- Who sets a car alarm in Parker Falls?
- That would be me.

10:11.711 --> 10:15.179
Oh, my gosh.
I am... I am so sorry.

10:15.214 --> 10:16.692
No, it's all... it's all good.
I'm okay.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.216
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't touch it. Don't touch it. I got it.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.329
- No, please. Come on.
- I am so sorry.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.219
Now you kind of
have to sit down, right?

10:25.057 --> 10:29.193
That's such a mess.
Would you like some hash browns?

10:30.730 --> 10:33.164
You're running
your grandpa's place now?

10:33.199 --> 10:35.065
More like it's running me.

10:35.101 --> 10:40.871
My folks moved to Florida, and
left me here to, manage the circus.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.774
- Not much changes around here?
- Oh, yeah?

10:43.843 --> 10:46.110
Well, actually...

10:46.179 --> 10:49.413
I got myself a new fella.
And he is pretty amazing.

10:49.449 --> 10:50.449
Really?

10:52.718 --> 10:55.586
- That's a cute kid.
- Thank you.

10:55.655 --> 11:00.357
Yeah, his name is Wesley,
and he is my world.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.525
You want more?

11:01.561 --> 11:04.728
- Kids?
- No. Coffee.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.897
Right!
No. No, no, no, no.

11:06.933 --> 11:10.868
I'm already overly caffeinated as it is.
It's called single parenting.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.671
I'm really sorry
to hear about you and David.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.207
- "Davis".
- Oh, Davis.

11:16.242 --> 11:20.511
Yeah, well, it's been two years,
and Wesley and I are doing fine.

11:20.546 --> 11:24.315
So what brings you back? I can't
imagine that it's for Spring Fling.

11:24.350 --> 11:28.486
Why not? You do remember
I was "Spring King," right?

11:29.755 --> 11:32.823
You always loved
being treated like royalty.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.561
Spring queen would always
knock me down a couple pegs.

11:39.432 --> 11:43.501
I'm here just waiting for my
job situation to sort itself out.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.602
Excuse me?

11:44.670 --> 11:47.338
Chase Taynor?
Can we get a quick photo?

11:47.373 --> 11:50.853
We wanted to tell you this town
still loves you in spite of...

11:50.877 --> 11:53.712
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.247
- Thank you.
- Sorry!

11:59.685 --> 12:01.485
Bye-bye.

12:01.521 --> 12:05.890
You know, I can deal with all the losing,
I just can't take all the sympathy.

12:05.925 --> 12:09.059
- I almost feel sorry for you.
- "Almost"?

12:09.095 --> 12:11.428
You are a baseball star
dating a supermodel.

12:11.497 --> 12:14.899
I am sorry, but there is
only so much sympathy you get.

12:14.934 --> 12:17.668
Well, I guess nothing's
really changed here, then.

12:17.703 --> 12:21.038
Mr. Swenson still paints
his house purple,

12:21.073 --> 12:24.775
and the fountain in front of city hall
still sprays cars as they drive by.

12:24.810 --> 12:28.946
And, I guess, I am still
right here, where you left me.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.083
Hold on.
You broke up with me.

12:33.452 --> 12:36.420
So I hear you're dating
Brett Thompson?

12:39.392 --> 12:41.292
He was a nice guy.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.893
Still is.

12:45.364 --> 12:48.473
I have to go,
but you'll be seeing me soon...

12:49.368 --> 12:50.608
Because you owe me an omelette.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.944
Hey!
Say hi to your folks.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.746
Welcome home.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.783
Well, I'm only here
for a week, so...

13:07.420 --> 13:09.219
I will.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.489
- It's good to see you, Jess.
- You too.

13:16.963 --> 13:21.432
- What was all that about?
- Ancient history.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.946
All right. I know yesterday's
practice was rough...

13:35.982 --> 13:37.414
But what do they say?

13:37.450 --> 13:39.784
You fall off a horse,
what do you do?

13:39.819 --> 13:40.819
Sell the horse?

13:42.855 --> 13:45.901
Listen, if you don't want to play baseball,
you don't have to play baseball.

13:45.925 --> 13:46.957
That's okay with me.

13:47.026 --> 13:52.363
But mom, I do want to play.
I'm just not that good.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.799
Well, you want to get better,
you have to practice.

13:54.867 --> 13:58.035
And for now, you have me,
so, let's go get better, okay?

14:01.874 --> 14:04.441
Mason, are you gonna take a look
at that vacuum today?

14:04.477 --> 14:07.222
- Yes, Lindy. I said I would.
- What's wrong with the vacuum?

14:07.246 --> 14:09.481
One of your mother's paintbrushes
got stuck in the rollers.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.184
That vacuum's been around
before I was born.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.020
What don't I just
buy you a new one?

14:16.055 --> 14:16.954
What?

14:17.023 --> 14:19.456
You afraid to get your hands dirty
fixing it or something?

14:19.525 --> 14:22.004
I didn't mean it like that.
I just figured, while I'm here...

14:22.028 --> 14:23.360
I can fix it at the shop.

14:29.402 --> 14:33.737
Okay, buddy, so you're gonna just...
Keep your eye on the ball.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.639
Right?

14:35.708 --> 14:38.276
At least that's what they say.
Okay.

14:40.846 --> 14:44.615
I'm sorry. It was just a little...
High. Okay.

14:46.118 --> 14:48.886
I know you are good at this.
You just need to concentrate.

14:51.957 --> 14:56.060
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.294
Are you sure?

14:57.363 --> 15:01.432
Mom, every time we practice
together, I just get worse.

15:01.467 --> 15:06.603
Buddy, I'm so sorry. Okay, we'll just,
take a five-minute break.

15:06.672 --> 15:09.206
Fine.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.069
Chase?

15:40.539 --> 15:42.539
- Hey!
- Hey...

15:43.743 --> 15:45.843
- How's it going?
- Good!

15:45.878 --> 15:48.078
Good.

15:48.114 --> 15:52.382
- What are you doing here?
- I'm just...

15:53.953 --> 15:55.385
I... I have a...

15:55.421 --> 15:56.565
There's a loose wire
underneath my dash here.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.288
Right.

15:58.357 --> 16:02.726
- Well, do you need me to call a tow?
- No. I just fixed it. It's all fixed now.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.662
- Any news on the job front?
- Yeah, it's percolating.

16:05.698 --> 16:06.830
Good.

16:06.866 --> 16:10.367
It's gonna take a few days, though,
but it's... It's looking really good.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.237
And in the meantime,
you're... hiding out?

16:13.272 --> 16:18.208
I'm not "hiding out".
I'm... "Laying low".

16:18.244 --> 16:19.943
Besides, I mean, who doesn't like

16:20.012 --> 16:22.513
the solitude of a plush sports car
with a great stereo system?

16:22.548 --> 16:25.836
Come on. Out with you. There's
someone I want you to meet.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.218
Hey, buddy. Come here.

16:33.192 --> 16:34.658
Get out of the car. Come on.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.065
- Who's this big guy?
- I'm Wesley.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.067
Wes, this is Chase.
We went to high school together.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.536
Nice to meet you.

16:45.571 --> 16:48.005
Chase is a baseball player, too.

16:48.040 --> 16:52.242
Wait. You're Chase Taynor?
From Boston?

16:52.278 --> 16:53.744
One and the same.

16:53.779 --> 16:58.048
"The" Chase Taynor?
We're on Chase Taynor field.

16:59.251 --> 17:00.662
Well, they had
to call it something. Right?

17:00.686 --> 17:02.686
All right, buddy,
let's get back to work.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.890
Ask him if he can coach me.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.592
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.993
But, mom, just ask him!

17:11.030 --> 17:13.430
Sweetie, I'm sure
that he has other commitments.

17:13.499 --> 17:16.500
But mom, you don't know
how to pitch,

17:16.535 --> 17:19.403
and there's a real pitcher
standing right here.

17:21.440 --> 17:28.045
Wesley would like to know if you could
help him with some baseball tips.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.016
Well, I...

17:33.052 --> 17:36.253
- I'm kind of... I'm kind of busy.
- See? He's kind of busy.

17:36.322 --> 17:40.057
- But he was just sitting in his car.
- Kid's got tenacity, huh?

17:40.092 --> 17:41.358
Please?

17:43.562 --> 17:46.897
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah. I'll do it.

17:46.932 --> 17:48.098
Yes!

17:51.570 --> 17:53.937
Do you have any idea
what you just agreed to?

17:54.006 --> 17:56.874
- The kid gave me no choice!
- That's true.

18:01.180 --> 18:04.848
All right.
See you tomorrow.

18:16.397 --> 18:20.032
Morning, kiddo.
How'd you sleep?

18:20.067 --> 18:21.900
I dreamed I hit a home run.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.604
Well, dreaming
is the first step to doing.

18:25.639 --> 18:28.006
Come on. Get up. Get up.

18:30.477 --> 18:34.046
Mom.
How do you know Chase anyway?

18:34.114 --> 18:36.214
We were in Spring Fling together.

18:36.283 --> 18:39.818
Actually, we were
Spring King and Spring Queen.

18:39.853 --> 18:43.388
So...
It's like you were married?

18:43.457 --> 18:47.459
No. It was decided on
by a town vote.

18:47.494 --> 18:51.797
So... everyone voted
you two should be together?

18:51.832 --> 18:54.599
Okay! Enough stalling.
It's time for you to get dressed.

18:54.635 --> 18:58.036
I will meet you after school
and walk you to practice with Chase.

19:09.116 --> 19:14.186
All right, I don't know how much
you know about coaching, but...

19:14.221 --> 19:16.021
Okay. Hey.

19:16.056 --> 19:18.824
I've been on baseball diamonds
like this my entire life.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.327
I've had some of
the best coaching in the world.

19:22.363 --> 19:25.075
I know I can teach Wesley the skills
he needs to play this great game.

19:25.099 --> 19:27.499
- I hope so.
- Okay, bud.

19:27.534 --> 19:28.812
You ready to knock out
a home run or two?

19:28.836 --> 19:30.102
Definitely!

19:30.137 --> 19:34.506
We should probably start by managing
expectations, and just teaching the basics?

19:34.541 --> 19:35.952
Are you going to be
hovering here all day?

19:35.976 --> 19:41.113
Wait! So you can ignore thousands
of fans, but I'm a distraction?

19:41.148 --> 19:45.384
Okay. You... Go to the stands.
Please.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.812
All right?
Give the kid some space.

19:48.622 --> 19:53.125
Fine.
I have work to do anyway.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.196
Okay. We're gonna start
with a little warm-up.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.432
18! 19! 20!

20:00.467 --> 20:01.933
Okay. Let's do some high-knees.

20:01.969 --> 20:04.202
Go across here. Let's go.
Come on. Stay focused!

20:04.271 --> 20:07.005
Come on. Get higher.

20:07.841 --> 20:08.940
Come on.

20:08.976 --> 20:12.144
- So, what exactly is happening here?
- We're getting in shape!

20:12.179 --> 20:16.448
- Okay. He's a kid!
- Great. Outstanding.

20:16.483 --> 20:22.988
Okay, Mr. Big-time, he's eight, not 18.
And this is Parker Falls, not Beantown.

20:23.023 --> 20:26.825
He's an athlete! From the Greek
word, "to fight for a prize".

20:28.028 --> 20:30.095
Okay. Okay.
Let's stop that.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.799
Now let's see what you got.

20:40.507 --> 20:43.835
Okay, one sec, then I wanna see you
hurl that ball like a rocket.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.352
That's not funny.

20:54.955 --> 20:55.921
All right,
let me see what you got.

20:55.956 --> 20:56.922
You ready for this?

20:56.957 --> 20:58.690
You can do it!
Come on, Wes!

21:04.465 --> 21:07.200
- My bad!
- Come on, buddy.

21:11.772 --> 21:14.105
Hey! Shake it off. It's okay.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.792
Okay, buddy.
Keep your head up, all right?

21:22.816 --> 21:24.983
I promise,
tomorrow will be better.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.019
Piece of advice?

21:28.088 --> 21:31.756
You don't need to teach Wes
to swing for the fences,

21:31.792 --> 21:33.492
just to swing.

21:33.527 --> 21:35.260
Let the kid dream a little.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.429
There's no harm in getting
a few tips from a pro.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.632
He doesn't need a hero,
he needs a coach.

21:42.903 --> 21:44.169
Trust me.

21:44.238 --> 21:45.804
We'll focus on the basics,

21:45.839 --> 21:48.440
and you never know,
maybe he'll become a slugger.

21:50.844 --> 21:53.945
Chase Taynor...
Always going for the glory.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.458
And what's wrong
with going for glory?

21:55.482 --> 21:57.315
Isn't that what
brought you back here?

21:59.086 --> 22:00.952
I'm kidding.

22:00.988 --> 22:02.087
Brett?

22:02.122 --> 22:06.625
Yeah, the festivities are
tonight and he's my date.

22:06.660 --> 22:07.792
You headed home?

22:07.828 --> 22:11.830
Home, roadhouse...
Who knows.

22:11.899 --> 22:15.233
Well, it's probably too quaint
for a city guy like you,

22:15.269 --> 22:16.968
but you should
stop by the festival.

22:17.004 --> 22:18.236
It's better than hiding out.

22:19.606 --> 22:23.608
I'm not hiding out.
I'm laying low.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.077
Right.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.651
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:32.686 --> 22:35.420
- Hey, Brett.
- Hey, honey.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.588
What's with all the pies?

22:37.724 --> 22:39.157
Hands off.

22:39.226 --> 22:42.060
I'm entering these in a contest
at the Spring Fling tonight.

22:42.095 --> 22:44.796
Are you picking me up,
or am I meeting you there?

22:44.831 --> 22:46.464
Jess, I'd love to go...

22:46.500 --> 22:48.266
But I just got word
of a rate hike.

22:48.302 --> 22:50.569
I got to recalculate
the premiums for all my clients.

22:52.239 --> 22:54.639
But you got yourself a paying
customer for the next six hours.

22:54.675 --> 22:56.074
Thank you.

22:56.109 --> 22:58.843
Now if just had a hundred more
like you, we'd be set.

22:58.912 --> 23:03.181
Welcome to the 42nd annual
Spring Fling festival!

23:03.250 --> 23:06.117
A week of food, music, and fun,

23:06.153 --> 23:09.421
plus our auction Wednesday night
to benefit our local schools,

23:09.456 --> 23:10.889
and don't forget...

23:10.924 --> 23:12.891
Chase! How are you doing?

23:12.926 --> 23:16.761
I just want to say
we're huge fans, we are.

23:16.797 --> 23:21.166
- About what happened...
- Thank you, thank you so much.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.835
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

23:26.306 --> 23:31.810
You are very brave for showing up.
So you found time in your schedule?

23:31.845 --> 23:34.746
Someone suggested
I shouldn't hide out.

23:34.781 --> 23:38.084
So why are you hiding
under that cap? May I?

23:40.387 --> 23:41.419
All right.

23:41.455 --> 23:43.121
That, and this is...
Just ridiculous.

23:43.156 --> 23:45.957
All right.
Much better.

23:45.993 --> 23:49.562
And we save the best for last,
when we wrap up the week

23:49.596 --> 23:52.598
with the father-son baseball
game at Chase Taynor park.

23:52.633 --> 23:57.435
And speaking of whom, did I see
Chase Taynor himself out there?

23:57.471 --> 23:59.471
Chase! Come on up!

24:01.141 --> 24:02.440
Your public awaits.

24:04.144 --> 24:07.212
- I was worried about this.
- Don't be! Just remember to smile!

24:07.247 --> 24:10.081
<i>Don't be shy.
Come on up here, Chase.</i>

24:10.117 --> 24:11.483
There you go.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.288
Chase Taynor,
ladies and gentlemen!

24:20.560 --> 24:22.427
Hey, everybody...

24:25.098 --> 24:27.966
It's fantastic
to be back home again.

24:36.977 --> 24:38.810
Well, it's great having you here,

24:38.879 --> 24:43.448
and about that game seven, well, who
doesn't make a mistake once in a while?

24:43.483 --> 24:44.749
But to us, you're still...

24:44.785 --> 24:46.618
I'm not a very good
public speaker,

24:48.789 --> 24:53.558
but I hope everyone enjoys
this year's Spring Fling.

24:53.593 --> 24:58.763
It should be the best one ever.
It's really good to be back home.

24:58.799 --> 25:00.465
Thanks, everyone.

25:00.534 --> 25:01.766
Give it up for Chase Taynor!

25:04.237 --> 25:06.071
Thank you.

25:06.106 --> 25:07.939
All right, everyone!
Let's have some fun!

25:13.515 --> 25:15.649
My grandfather started
selling sandwiches

25:15.984 --> 25:18.084
out of his canteen truck
to save up for this place,

25:18.120 --> 25:19.953
and now food trucks
are all the rage.

25:19.988 --> 25:21.821
He was ahead of his time.

25:21.890 --> 25:23.534
You're not seriously thinking
about getting one, are you?

25:23.558 --> 25:27.260
I just think a rolling diner
would raise our visibility around town.

25:28.764 --> 25:30.930
Yeah, it's probably not the best idea

25:30.966 --> 25:33.767
to take out a second loan
when I can't pay off the first one.

25:35.704 --> 25:39.372
So, I heard that someone's
got a new private coach.

25:40.475 --> 25:43.404
- You "heard", huh?
- Just, you know, word on the street.

25:44.980 --> 25:47.914
With Wesley's coach retiring
and my lack of skill set,

25:47.949 --> 25:49.983
Chase is pretty much
the only alternative.

25:50.352 --> 25:52.885
So, are there any fireworks
left from high school?

25:52.921 --> 25:57.190
This is just a pit stop for Chase
on the way back to the big-time.

25:57.225 --> 26:00.660
- I'd be sensible to keep my distance.
- Since when is sensible fun?

26:00.695 --> 26:03.429
Chase skipped town
and never looked back,

26:03.498 --> 26:05.231
and Davis left
to go "find" himself.

26:05.266 --> 26:08.034
At this point,
I'll take sensible any day.

26:08.069 --> 26:10.536
Well, speaking of
sensible, right on schedule.

26:10.572 --> 26:11.938
Exactly!

26:12.006 --> 26:13.439
- Hi!
- Hey.

26:13.508 --> 26:14.440
Hello. Hi.

26:14.509 --> 26:17.543
So, how's it going
with Chase coaching Wesley?

26:17.579 --> 26:20.079
Like an ant trying
to climb Everest.

26:20.115 --> 26:22.648
Ah, poor Wes.
He'll figure it out.

26:22.684 --> 26:24.084
Actually, I was
talking about Chase.

26:24.152 --> 26:26.919
Well!
Well, cheer up.

26:26.988 --> 26:29.889
A little something
for you, my dear.

26:29.924 --> 26:32.392
- An invitation.
- To what?

26:32.427 --> 26:35.762
Our reservation at
Le spectre for Thursday.

26:35.830 --> 26:39.766
- For my birthday?
- Yeah.

26:39.834 --> 26:42.034
I can count on you
to think of everything.

26:42.070 --> 26:44.103
Steel trap.

26:48.410 --> 26:52.845
- Spence! Hey, tell me good news.
- You bet, big guy. We got movement.

26:52.881 --> 26:54.847
Movement?
Well, that's great.

26:54.883 --> 26:58.317
Well... more like trial balloons,
but you know how these things go.

26:58.353 --> 27:00.197
<i>Any of the real offers
wait till the 11th hour.</i>

27:00.221 --> 27:02.522
Listen, I just need you to be
patient a little bit longer.

27:02.557 --> 27:05.158
- I'll try.
- Talk to you soon.

27:15.737 --> 27:19.872
Bottom of the ninth, bases are
loaded, and here comes the pitch...

27:24.712 --> 27:25.812
Good power!

27:25.847 --> 27:28.869
Now meet the ball when it comes in,
and you're gonna knock it to Mars.

27:33.488 --> 27:35.521
Okay. All right.
We'll get it.

27:35.557 --> 27:38.991
Hey.
Hey!

27:39.027 --> 27:41.060
I don't know
that your approach is working.

27:41.095 --> 27:43.396
Time out.

27:44.866 --> 27:49.202
Obviously, Wes can't concentrate with
all of your helicopter parenting, okay?

27:49.237 --> 27:52.538
"Helicopter parenting"?
No, I'm sorry.

27:52.574 --> 27:54.474
It's called taking
an interest in your child!

27:54.509 --> 27:59.645
Look, just give us some space.
Let me do this my way.

27:59.681 --> 28:01.881
I'll bring Wesley back to the
diner in an hour or so. Okay?

28:01.916 --> 28:04.585
- Are you okay with that?
- Yeah.

28:04.652 --> 28:09.989
Okay. Fine.
I have an errand to run anyway.

28:12.160 --> 28:13.759
Bye.

28:33.248 --> 28:35.414
Hey there, young lady!
Got your eye on a used car?

28:35.483 --> 28:40.219
- Hey. I'm just looking.
- Looking's the first step to buying.

28:40.255 --> 28:45.358
Yeah. Not today, but that truck
over there is interesting.

28:45.393 --> 28:47.104
Don't see food trucks
like that baby anymore.

28:47.128 --> 28:49.128
It looks like
it's seen better days.

28:49.163 --> 28:53.032
Well, she's a classic, which is why
a truck like this doesn't come cheap.

28:53.067 --> 28:54.300
Tell you what.

28:54.335 --> 28:58.804
I can do something for you, and I think
it's gonna really help you out.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.373
What do you say about that?

29:02.677 --> 29:05.011
Not in this lifetime.

29:06.147 --> 29:07.147
You know where I am!

29:11.719 --> 29:15.021
Okay. All right.
One more time.

29:15.056 --> 29:17.657
Keep your head down, shoulders back,
and keep your eye on the ball.

29:24.365 --> 29:27.400
Okay.
Let's take five.

29:28.570 --> 29:31.504
This is hopeless.
We've been here two hours.

29:31.839 --> 29:36.876
I could practice a million years,
I'm never gonna be like you.

29:36.944 --> 29:38.544
Be like me?

29:38.613 --> 29:41.013
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

29:41.082 --> 29:45.317
- But you're a big star.
- A "big star"?

29:45.353 --> 29:49.822
Wes, I'm the guy that gave up a grand
slam to lose the biggest game of the year.

29:49.857 --> 29:55.194
And now, well, my arm is starting
to fade and no team will touch me.

29:55.263 --> 29:59.665
My best years might be behind me,
but I got an eye for talent,

29:59.700 --> 30:02.968
and I know you have potential.
I wouldn't kid about that.

30:03.004 --> 30:05.104
All right? So let's...

30:05.139 --> 30:06.805
Let's clean up.
Let's get you back home.

30:27.662 --> 30:29.361
Can you do that again?

30:34.135 --> 30:36.235
I think you're ready
for the majors, man!

30:37.571 --> 30:40.906
- What are you so happy about?
- Two base hits!

30:40.942 --> 30:43.175
And Chase even taught me
some fancy pitches.

30:43.244 --> 30:46.413
What? That is great!
High-five!

30:47.481 --> 30:49.949
Go clean up
and I'll make you a snack.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.486
Kid's a natural.

30:54.522 --> 30:56.622
And things actually
went surprisingly well.

30:56.657 --> 30:58.290
How did you do it?

30:58.326 --> 31:01.171
I don't know, I just opened up
to him about my situation,

31:01.195 --> 31:06.098
- ... and he began to improve.
- Your "situation"?

31:06.133 --> 31:08.167
My arm's just not the same
as it used to be.

31:08.235 --> 31:13.439
Well, maybe admitting you lost
was the best way to win him over.

31:13.474 --> 31:14.740
I don't follow.

31:14.775 --> 31:18.344
Every hero Wesley's ever had
disappoints...

31:18.412 --> 31:21.413
Especially his dad,
with all of his big promises.

31:21.449 --> 31:24.850
Take him to a double-header in
Cleveland, teach him electric guitar...

31:24.919 --> 31:28.287
What Wesley needs is somebody
who can be real with him.

31:28.322 --> 31:29.822
He trusts that.

31:29.857 --> 31:30.857
Chase!

31:31.959 --> 31:33.926
Can you come
to my big game tomorrow?

31:33.961 --> 31:35.494
Sweetie, we've asked
enough of Chase.

31:36.731 --> 31:40.632
Honestly, I'm kind of a bad
luck charm right now, but...

31:40.668 --> 31:42.568
But if you want me there,
I'll be there, buddy.

31:42.603 --> 31:43.603
Awesome!

31:47.108 --> 31:50.075
- Hi! Hi.
- Hi, babe. Hi.

31:51.479 --> 31:54.513
Guess who I just sold
a term life policy to?

31:54.582 --> 32:00.185
Do you remember Chase?
He's helping Wesley practice.

32:00.254 --> 32:03.455
Yeah! Hey, Chase.
Been a while since high school.

32:03.491 --> 32:07.926
- Yeah, how you doing, Brett?
- Hey. Bummer about the series, huh?

32:07.962 --> 32:12.731
Too bad there's no baseball
insurance. Am I right?

32:12.767 --> 32:20.529
Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's too bad.
Well, it's good to see you, Brett.

32:20.741 --> 32:22.808
- I'll see you around, okay?
- Thank you.

32:27.314 --> 32:30.049
Dinner was amazing.
What was it again?

32:30.084 --> 32:33.119
- Gnocchi with mushroom sauce.
- Delicious.

32:33.154 --> 32:35.154
Delicious enough to add
to the diner menu?

32:35.189 --> 32:36.500
What's wrong
with the menu you have?

32:36.524 --> 32:38.135
People come to the diner
for burgers and fries.

32:38.159 --> 32:40.326
I'm thinking
of mixing it up a bit.

32:40.361 --> 32:43.462
How about we mix it up with some
of this great-looking apple pie?

32:43.498 --> 32:46.432
No, look, I'm serious.
I've been thinking.

32:46.467 --> 32:49.802
Since Charlie keeps
stealing business away,

32:49.837 --> 32:53.339
with a food truck, maybe we could
just steal some of that business back.

32:53.374 --> 32:54.840
The truck idea again?

32:54.876 --> 32:58.010
Yes! People love the diner,
they've just forgotten about it.

32:58.079 --> 33:00.579
And, with a food truck, we could
remind them that we're here.

33:00.615 --> 33:06.118
We could do ball games, and
fairgrounds and church picnics.

33:06.154 --> 33:09.655
I could revamp the menu,
and have a grand re-opening.

33:09.690 --> 33:11.090
- Jess.
- All I need...

33:11.125 --> 33:13.759
...is for you to just help me
make those numbers work.

33:15.263 --> 33:16.762
That's the problem, Jess.

33:16.798 --> 33:20.699
A truck's a fun idea,
but it's too risky.

33:20.768 --> 33:22.368
Here.

33:22.436 --> 33:27.106
Of all new business ventures,
40% fail right out of the gate.

33:27.141 --> 33:32.511
And those that survive the
first year, 50% fail the next.

33:32.580 --> 33:34.013
And even if you make it that far,

33:34.081 --> 33:38.250
you have amortization on the truck,
added upkeep and costs.

33:38.286 --> 33:41.420
There's just the tiniest chance
of it being truly profitable.

33:41.455 --> 33:43.856
Just better to be safe
than sorry, right?

33:43.925 --> 33:45.958
Now, how about some of this pie?

33:45.993 --> 33:49.295
- I'm not hungry anymore.
- Was it something I said?

33:56.839 --> 33:59.974
- Hey. There he is.
- Hey.

34:00.009 --> 34:01.754
You're sure you're up
for helping me out with this?

34:01.778 --> 34:04.779
Yeah. Of course.
Why would you ask?

34:04.814 --> 34:06.625
What was that you used to say
all the time in high school

34:06.649 --> 34:08.181
when I asked you to help me out?

34:08.217 --> 34:11.485
You didn't want to risk hurting
your million-dollar hands?

34:11.521 --> 34:13.621
Yeah, I said a lot
of dumb things back then.

34:13.656 --> 34:17.625
Anyway, your mother is thrilled
to have you back home for once.

34:17.659 --> 34:19.527
She misses you something fierce.

34:19.562 --> 34:21.329
I've been busy, dad.

34:21.364 --> 34:23.664
But at least we get to see
each other once every season.

34:23.699 --> 34:26.844
It's great when you fly us in,
put us up at those fancy hotels.

34:26.869 --> 34:28.135
That's really generous.

34:28.170 --> 34:30.504
We would just rather have
a bit more of your time.

34:30.540 --> 34:32.460
That's all. What's the matter?
You got a problem?

34:35.110 --> 34:36.487
Don't do anything
without me, all right?

34:36.512 --> 34:38.145
I'll be back in a couple hours!

34:38.181 --> 34:39.181
Hey, ma.

34:44.554 --> 34:47.455
Just like old times?

35:01.037 --> 35:05.206
Chase isn't here?
He's gonna miss my turn at bat.

35:05.274 --> 35:06.941
You know what, sweetie?
It's okay.

35:06.976 --> 35:09.844
You just get out there and you do
the very best you can do, okay?

35:09.879 --> 35:11.379
You're gonna be great!

35:11.447 --> 35:13.514
All right, Wes!
Come on, buddy!

35:13.549 --> 35:15.850
You can do it!

35:17.020 --> 35:19.588
- Chase was supposed to be here, huh?
- He said he would.

35:20.757 --> 35:22.423
- Hey!
- Hey!

35:22.458 --> 35:26.260
- Is this seat taken?
- Yeah! Sit. Now.

35:27.830 --> 35:31.165
Sorry I was late.
I was fixing a fence.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.266
You're just in time.

35:32.301 --> 35:35.369
Okay, come on, buddy. Keep your
eyes on the ball. Stay focused.

35:35.438 --> 35:37.471
Stop talking.
You're making me nervous.

35:37.507 --> 35:38.806
Shh! Both of you. Quiet!

35:45.214 --> 35:46.947
Yeah!

35:49.585 --> 35:51.018
You taught him that?

35:51.087 --> 35:54.522
I'm just a good talent scout.
The kid's a natural.

35:54.590 --> 35:55.590
Way to go, Wes!

36:01.097 --> 36:04.799
Here we go. Good game
today. That was amazing.

36:04.834 --> 36:06.434
And for you.

36:06.469 --> 36:11.472
Good job today, gentlemen.
And... high-five. There you go.

36:11.507 --> 36:13.340
Look at that.

36:15.311 --> 36:19.914
It's so nice to see Wes
bonding with his team.

36:19.949 --> 36:22.249
Finally.

36:22.285 --> 36:25.419
Well, it looks like the coach
has everything under control.

36:26.656 --> 36:29.668
Might go even better without his
mom hovering over him for a bit?

36:29.692 --> 36:31.659
But...

36:33.029 --> 36:34.695
Fine.

36:34.764 --> 36:37.031
Maybe you're right.

36:38.835 --> 36:40.501
I'm sorry,
I didn't expect the rain.

36:40.536 --> 36:42.436
You know what they
say about April showers.

36:42.472 --> 36:46.240
- You get a raincheck?
- Yeah, right.

36:53.783 --> 36:56.350
You know, you really
hung in there with Wes.

36:57.920 --> 37:00.988
I got to say, I'm surprised.

37:01.023 --> 37:05.025
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

37:05.094 --> 37:07.495
- He's a terrific kid.
- Yeah. Thanks.

37:07.530 --> 37:10.030
He's got real talent.

37:10.099 --> 37:11.899
Well, you helped show him
how to use it.

37:11.934 --> 37:13.734
I'm just happy I had the time.

37:13.769 --> 37:15.970
In fact, I might have
more time to help him.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.939
What do you mean?

37:20.276 --> 37:22.910
There haven't been
any real offers yet.

37:24.280 --> 37:26.447
I don't know if there will be.

37:26.482 --> 37:30.117
Come on!
You're a star pitcher.

37:30.153 --> 37:34.455
Or maybe just a has-been
with a fading arm.

37:34.490 --> 37:36.090
Your agent is still
working on it, right?

37:38.127 --> 37:39.327
Okay, well.
There's still hope.

37:40.730 --> 37:44.498
You always did look
on the bright side.

37:45.835 --> 37:47.768
I try.

37:50.439 --> 37:53.307
As long as we're being honest...

37:53.342 --> 37:58.345
I am doing all I can to be mom
and dad to an eight-year-old

37:58.414 --> 38:04.451
and keep grandpa's diner afloat
while the wolves are just circling.

38:04.487 --> 38:08.822
If something doesn't change
soon, I'm gonna lose the diner.

38:08.891 --> 38:10.402
I was thinking about
getting a food truck

38:10.426 --> 38:14.728
to spread the word around town, and
maybe even do a grand re-opening,

38:14.764 --> 38:17.798
but it all just seems so risky.

38:19.168 --> 38:21.268
You know what they say?

38:21.304 --> 38:24.605
If the batting order isn't working,
you might want to switch it up.

38:27.843 --> 38:29.343
It's funny...

38:29.412 --> 38:35.983
Seeing you after all these years reminds
me of how little my life has changed.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.118
Are you kidding me?

38:38.154 --> 38:40.221
You've raised a great kid.

38:41.490 --> 38:43.824
I mean, for me...

38:43.893 --> 38:48.395
These past 15 years
have felt almost like a dream...

38:49.999 --> 38:55.169
I look around, all these people
are in your corner, and then...

38:55.238 --> 38:57.171
The next minute,
you wake up and...

38:57.240 --> 38:59.340
They're all gone.

39:03.512 --> 39:04.745
Remember that lamppost?

39:06.582 --> 39:08.115
That's where we had our first kiss.

39:08.150 --> 39:11.418
No, that lamppost is where
we had our first argument.

39:11.454 --> 39:14.888
This is where we had our first kiss.

39:14.924 --> 39:17.791
Well, it's been more than 15 years.

39:20.062 --> 39:23.597
- Why don't we bury the hatchet?
- Bury the hatchet?

39:23.633 --> 39:28.636
Once you left, you never
even contacted me. Not once.

39:28.671 --> 39:31.105
That was the part
that really hurt.

39:35.378 --> 39:36.810
I know it's years too late, but...

39:38.648 --> 39:40.481
I'm sorry.

39:42.151 --> 39:43.984
Me too.

39:44.053 --> 39:46.453
Peace?

39:46.489 --> 39:48.489
Done.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.767
Dad...

39:59.802 --> 40:01.769
What are you doing?
I was gonna help you.

40:01.804 --> 40:03.070
No, I think I'm done.

40:03.105 --> 40:05.584
Okay, well, let me... Let me take
care of the painting, at least.

40:05.608 --> 40:06.774
Don't worry about it.

40:06.809 --> 40:09.410
You always had
bigger things on your mind.

40:09.445 --> 40:14.381
Why don't you go was up those
million-dollar hands for dinner, huh?

40:19.921 --> 40:23.089
You ready for bed, sweetie?

40:23.125 --> 40:27.627
You smile at Chase.
A lot.

40:30.465 --> 40:31.631
Well...

40:31.700 --> 40:37.637
Maybe that's because he makes you
smile, and that makes me really happy.

40:37.706 --> 40:39.873
I'm so proud of you.

40:39.908 --> 40:41.775
You were really great today.

40:44.780 --> 40:47.480
I had a great coach.

40:47.549 --> 40:49.649
All right, mister.
It's time for bed.

40:49.718 --> 40:53.587
- I love you.
- I love you more.

41:08.539 --> 41:10.305
Hi. How you doing?

41:10.341 --> 41:12.709
You know where I can find some
primer? I gotta paint the fence.

41:12.777 --> 41:16.712
For Chase Taynor? I'll walk you
there myself. Come on!

41:16.781 --> 41:18.380
Thanks, man.

41:18.749 --> 41:20.949
- Hey, Chase.
- Hey, Brett.

41:20.984 --> 41:23.185
- How ya doing?
- Pretty good. Yourself?

41:23.253 --> 41:25.220
Yeah, I'm great, great.
Business is booming.

41:25.255 --> 41:28.256
Baseball seasons, they may come and go,
but people always need insurance.

41:28.292 --> 41:31.660
Yeah. That's...
That's true.

41:31.728 --> 41:33.995
Listen, I really appreciate
you helping Wesley.

41:34.064 --> 41:36.164
We're having a great time.
He's a terrific kid.

41:36.233 --> 41:37.933
So, when are you
heading out of town?

41:37.968 --> 41:41.169
That, that arm still
got some miles left in it?

41:41.238 --> 41:43.638
Jury's still out.

41:43.674 --> 41:45.740
Well, fingers crossed
you'll be on your way soon.

41:45.776 --> 41:46.896
Yeah, well, good to see you.

41:48.412 --> 41:49.845
All right, so,
what do we got here?

42:02.126 --> 42:03.592
Hello?

42:06.463 --> 42:07.496
Wes.

42:07.564 --> 42:11.900
Baseball takes focus.
What's on your mind?

42:11.935 --> 42:15.837
Dad and me used to practice here
almost every day after school.

42:15.906 --> 42:18.173
Did your dad teach you baseball?

42:19.476 --> 42:21.643
Yeah. In fact...

42:23.447 --> 42:25.881
He taught me how to throw
my first curveball.

42:25.916 --> 42:30.652
And then, in junior high, my coach
took over, my dad kind of stepped back.

42:30.721 --> 42:32.654
It's good to have those memories.

42:32.723 --> 42:37.659
The way that I see it,
when things change and life gets tricky,

42:37.728 --> 42:39.561
baseball's still there for you.

42:39.596 --> 42:42.964
- How do you know that?
- Personal experience.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.334
So nobody wants to pick you
for their team, huh?

42:47.838 --> 42:52.207
- Yeah, that pretty much nails it.
- Maybe you gotta be patient, too.

42:52.242 --> 42:53.742
Oh, so now
you're giving me advice?

42:53.777 --> 42:57.045
Somebody has to.
Mom says you never listen.

42:57.080 --> 42:58.213
She does, does she?

42:58.248 --> 43:00.782
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

43:02.052 --> 43:05.120
She also says you're leaving soon.

43:05.155 --> 43:09.257
- Is that true?
- Yeah, it's true.

43:10.727 --> 43:12.661
But you know what?
Until then...

43:12.729 --> 43:15.096
I say we have as much fun
as possible!

43:18.969 --> 43:22.270
Right here, okay?

43:27.110 --> 43:28.577
Way to go, bud.

43:38.755 --> 43:41.556
- Hey, Brett.
- Hi, Jess. How you doing?

43:41.592 --> 43:45.427
Great. And looking especially good
tonight, if I do say so myself.

43:45.462 --> 43:47.896
Look...
I'm so sorry, hon,

43:47.931 --> 43:50.565
but the owner of Bacon Barrel called
and he wants to meet up

43:50.601 --> 43:53.268
<i>to talk coverage
for all 18 of his locations.</i>

43:53.303 --> 43:54.803
<i>Can we take a raincheck
on tonight?</i>

43:54.871 --> 43:57.305
Sure, that's okay.

43:57.374 --> 44:02.811
My grandpa always said, "when
opportunity knocks, better answer".

44:02.879 --> 44:04.145
Thanks, Jess.

44:04.214 --> 44:06.248
We'll celebrate even bigger
next weekend, okay?

44:06.283 --> 44:09.150
<i>In the meantime,
I had a little present sent over.</i>

44:09.219 --> 44:13.355
<i>You might want to peek out your front
door... Just a little something I found.</i>

44:15.359 --> 44:17.259
<i>So...
What do you think?</i>

44:18.695 --> 44:22.397
An air purifier.

44:22.432 --> 44:25.433
I really don't know
quite what to say.

44:25.469 --> 44:29.070
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

44:57.467 --> 45:01.703
Wake up, Jessica.
In a week, he'll be gone.

45:05.809 --> 45:08.310
I tell you, kid,
five home runs in one game.

45:08.378 --> 45:10.345
But Griffin got
10 home runs in one game!

45:10.380 --> 45:11.724
No, he didn't!
He's not even a baseball player.

45:11.748 --> 45:12.847
Yeah, he is.

45:13.336 --> 45:15.116
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:15.185 --> 45:17.686
Mom? I thought
I had the babysitter.

45:17.721 --> 45:20.522
Something came up for Brett
so we postponed.

45:20.557 --> 45:23.391
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.

45:23.427 --> 45:26.394
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

45:26.430 --> 45:27.962
All right, guys.
Well, good night.

45:28.031 --> 45:31.366
Wait! Mom, what're
we doing for dinner?

45:31.401 --> 45:32.701
We have leftovers in the fridge.

45:32.736 --> 45:33.776
I thought I'd heat 'em up.

45:41.445 --> 45:45.113
Well, I'm game, but we're
gonna have to ask your mom.

45:45.182 --> 45:48.416
- Ask me what?
- Well, since it is your birthday...

45:48.452 --> 45:51.286
And you're always cooking for
everyone else at the diner...

45:51.355 --> 45:53.254
When was the last time
somebody made you dinner?

46:00.097 --> 46:03.231
I'll have you know... I once used
mini-bar peanuts, coffee creamer,

46:03.266 --> 46:06.434
and instant noodles
to make an epic Pad Thai.

46:08.905 --> 46:10.939
What?

46:11.007 --> 46:13.041
Well, I must say, I'm impressed.

46:13.076 --> 46:15.744
Your supermodel must
think you're quite the catch.

46:15.779 --> 46:18.113
Actually, I've never even
cooked for her.

46:18.181 --> 46:19.581
I don't even know if she eats.

46:22.018 --> 46:23.718
That was fun today, coach.

46:23.754 --> 46:27.122
- We're on again for tomorrow, right?
- You bet, champ.

46:31.128 --> 46:33.769
- What's going on?
- Is there something else, Wesley?

46:34.998 --> 46:39.167
Well, kind of...
I mean...

46:39.202 --> 46:42.070
You can say it, pal.
What's on your mind?

46:42.105 --> 46:45.573
Will you play in my father-son
baseball game on Friday?

46:46.843 --> 46:51.112
I know you're not my dad,
but the other kids'll have theirs and...

46:56.253 --> 47:00.255
Sweetie, he's probably
gonna be gone by then.

47:00.290 --> 47:04.659
I'd love to be there.
It'd be an honor.

47:13.336 --> 47:15.170
Thanks, Chase.

47:15.205 --> 47:16.337
You bet, pal.

47:19.109 --> 47:21.509
Well, I think the only thing
missing is dessert.

47:21.545 --> 47:23.745
Wish I could whip up
a birthday cake.

47:25.015 --> 47:27.415
I know where
we can get a funnel cake.

47:29.753 --> 47:32.053
Thank you so much
for spending time with Wesley.

47:32.088 --> 47:37.091
Not having his dad around the last
two years has not been easy on him.

47:37.160 --> 47:41.095
No thanks needed.
He's great.

47:41.164 --> 47:43.198
So, any nibbles
from the baseball world?

47:43.233 --> 47:45.667
Nibbles.
That's about it.

47:45.702 --> 47:48.503
- Maybe it's all for the best.
- What do you mean?

47:48.538 --> 47:50.104
Where's all that glory
gotten me?

47:50.173 --> 47:54.108
Fifteen years gone, my dad
thinks I'm full of myself.

47:54.177 --> 47:56.678
Maybe I was... or am.

47:56.713 --> 48:00.081
Come on. Deep down,
your dad is proud of you.

48:00.150 --> 48:01.483
There's no way he couldn't be.

48:01.518 --> 48:04.919
I don't know about that.
We just don't get along.

48:04.988 --> 48:07.655
Well, maybe you're just
out of practice.

48:12.028 --> 48:13.539
You know, I forgot how
friendly everyone here is.

48:14.664 --> 48:20.435
Parker Falls isn't Boston, but
there's a reason people love it.

48:20.504 --> 48:23.037
I just wish I could figure out
the diner part of the puzzle.

48:23.073 --> 48:25.039
Things are starting
to get really desperate.

48:25.075 --> 48:27.275
Well, what about
the food truck idea?

48:27.344 --> 48:29.322
I mean, you said yourself,
everyone loves the diner.

48:29.346 --> 48:30.857
Maybe they just need
to be reminded of it.

48:30.881 --> 48:32.558
And the food truck will
give you more visibility.

48:32.582 --> 48:34.415
And you could do
that grand re-opening.

48:34.484 --> 48:38.553
Yeah, I don't know.
I am barely hanging on as it is.

48:38.588 --> 48:39.821
Thank you.

48:39.856 --> 48:40.722
I mean, maybe Brett's right.

48:40.757 --> 48:43.258
Doubling down on the food truck
is not a good idea.

48:43.326 --> 48:47.595
Come on, Jess. You've gotta...
you've got to take a chance.

48:47.664 --> 48:52.233
Chase Taynor.
Always rolling the dice.

48:54.104 --> 48:56.905
Hey, look, I'll help you out.

48:56.973 --> 48:58.806
Thank you,

48:58.842 --> 49:01.743
but I have been standing on my own
two feet for a very long time now.

49:01.811 --> 49:05.813
Believe me, I can see that.
But I got my hands free.

49:05.849 --> 49:08.349
This will give me a chance
to make up for the past.

49:08.385 --> 49:10.752
Step right up!

49:10.820 --> 49:12.086
How about you, sir?

49:14.424 --> 49:15.924
No, I'm okay, man.

49:19.331 --> 49:25.034
- What exactly is this, again?
- New silicone spatula. Lightweight.

49:25.103 --> 49:28.037
Good grip. Colorful.

49:28.106 --> 49:30.606
Or the old standard
metal flipper.

49:30.642 --> 49:32.808
Good to have choices, right?

49:34.045 --> 49:37.780
Speaking of which, how are
things with, you know, Brett?

49:38.850 --> 49:40.883
Fine.

49:40.952 --> 49:43.519
Okay, now that we've got
"fine" out of your system,

49:43.554 --> 49:46.155
how about you tell
your old friend the truth?

49:48.893 --> 49:50.526
Things are fine.

49:50.561 --> 49:53.396
Brett is... Brett.

49:53.558 --> 49:56.477
Very dependable, and pretty cute,
in a total nerdy kind of way.

49:57.535 --> 49:59.297
And then there's Chase...

50:00.839 --> 50:03.773
This is not about
spatulas at all, is it?

50:03.808 --> 50:06.442
I don't know, Nina. I just...

50:06.477 --> 50:08.210
I've been thinking lately

50:08.279 --> 50:12.177
that maybe the last couple of years
I've just been playing it safe.

50:12.269 --> 50:13.415
What do you mean?

50:13.451 --> 50:15.329
Well, I've had two guys
leave town on me...

50:15.353 --> 50:17.486
Wesley's dad and Chase...

50:17.522 --> 50:20.467
And maybe that's why I've picked
the most reliable man in the world,

50:20.491 --> 50:23.693
and I'm still serving the same menu
my grandpa did 40 years ago.

50:23.761 --> 50:25.127
So what are you saying?

50:26.364 --> 50:29.832
The diner's hanging on
by a thread anyway.

50:29.867 --> 50:34.470
Maybe it's high time I...
Swung for the fences.

50:37.208 --> 50:39.409
You know how to play baseball?

50:41.613 --> 50:43.413
Okay, this is gonna
call for some teamwork.

50:44.616 --> 50:46.449
You do your part,
and I'll handle the rest.

50:46.484 --> 50:47.317
- Here he comes.
- Okay.

50:48.386 --> 50:50.219
Hello again!
You're back.

50:51.690 --> 50:53.367
Guess you couldn't forget
about this baby, could you?

50:53.391 --> 50:55.151
You seem like a man
who wants to make a deal.

50:56.127 --> 50:58.227
You're Chase Taynor.

50:58.263 --> 51:02.076
Of course.
Always up for a deal, but...

51:02.100 --> 51:03.433
Good! Good.

51:03.468 --> 51:07.704
'Cause I can see, by the way this truck
is sitting, that the struts need work.

51:07.739 --> 51:10.640
- Struts?
- Yeah. The struts.

51:14.145 --> 51:15.856
And there's... there's a puddle
underneath there.

51:15.880 --> 51:18.748
Looks like the coolant
reservoir's got some issues, too.

51:18.783 --> 51:21.284
- Minor adjustment.
- I'll take it from here.

51:21.353 --> 51:25.254
And from what I've seen
of how you tip at the diner...

51:25.290 --> 51:27.924
I think you could really
use this sale.

51:27.959 --> 51:30.526
But I'm in sales myself,
so I'm willing to deal.

51:30.562 --> 51:34.063
I checked the bluebook,
and this is my offer.

51:34.099 --> 51:35.965
Take it or leave it.

51:38.436 --> 51:41.404
Well, what you fail to consider...

51:41.439 --> 51:44.073
Nope.
I considered it all.

51:44.109 --> 51:48.177
The question is,
have you?

51:48.213 --> 51:51.014
- I'll go write it up.
- Thank you.

51:51.049 --> 51:53.050
- Good man!
- Yeah.

51:55.120 --> 51:57.120
Now that was teamwork.

52:07.799 --> 52:11.300
- Why are we stopping here?
- I called up your dad.

52:26.518 --> 52:28.384
These are for you.

52:31.523 --> 52:33.557
All right, buddy. Let's go.
Put some muscle into it.

52:38.129 --> 52:41.364
Wait. Way up here.
Water... water...

53:01.019 --> 53:02.518
There you go.

53:05.056 --> 53:06.756
Nice!
Hood job, buddy.

53:14.866 --> 53:15.898
There you go.

53:26.344 --> 53:29.579
We've still got a long way to go,
but that's a good start.

53:29.614 --> 53:31.581
Not bad for a day's work.

53:34.085 --> 53:37.587
Looks like you got those
million-dollar hands a little dirty.

53:37.622 --> 53:40.089
I think it suits me just fine.

53:49.601 --> 53:52.001
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey.

53:52.036 --> 53:53.569
Thanks for
finally calling me back.

53:53.605 --> 53:57.773
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I've just been busy.

53:57.842 --> 53:59.053
Don't tell me
you bought a food truck.

53:59.077 --> 54:00.409
I did!

54:02.280 --> 54:03.412
What do you think?

54:06.351 --> 54:09.185
I guess I just thought
that you would be happy for me.

54:09.220 --> 54:11.087
I am happy for you,

54:11.156 --> 54:14.824
but we talked about this,
the costs, the risks.

54:14.859 --> 54:17.527
And I appreciate
your perspective,

54:17.562 --> 54:21.264
but this is something
that I really want to do.

54:21.332 --> 54:23.099
And the odds that
I explained to you?

54:23.168 --> 54:26.035
Yes, there are gonna be
challenges, of course, but...

54:26.070 --> 54:27.703
Jessica. Jessica.

54:27.739 --> 54:30.339
I'm only trying to keep you
from making a mistake.

54:30.375 --> 54:33.876
Rolling the dice on a food truck,
you could lose the diner.

54:33.912 --> 54:37.914
And if I do nothing and
business doesn't get any better,

54:37.982 --> 54:39.582
then I'm gonna
lose the diner anyway.

54:39.651 --> 54:42.018
You need to weigh the risks,
it's just not worth it.

54:42.053 --> 54:44.487
You are always trying
to talk me out of these things!

54:44.522 --> 54:46.155
I'm just trying to help.

54:46.191 --> 54:48.891
And who's been putting these
ridiculous ideas into your head anyways?

54:50.261 --> 54:51.561
I have.

54:53.231 --> 54:58.434
- You think my dreams are ridiculous?
- I'm just giving you advice.

55:00.905 --> 55:03.406
Look.

55:03.474 --> 55:05.308
You're a really great guy...

55:06.711 --> 55:09.712
But maybe we just need
some time off.

55:13.651 --> 55:15.818
Yeah. Maybe we do.

55:31.869 --> 55:33.836
Jessica.

55:35.039 --> 55:36.706
I'm sorry about you and Brett.

55:36.741 --> 55:38.541
Don't be.

55:38.576 --> 55:40.343
So I didn't take his advice.

55:40.378 --> 55:45.248
If he can't handle that, then we weren't
as close as I thought we were to begin with.

55:45.316 --> 55:48.884
That...
That makes two of us.

55:48.920 --> 55:52.488
- What happened?
- I saw this online this morning.

55:52.523 --> 55:55.658
Picture of Heather
on my old teammate's yacht.

55:55.693 --> 55:58.027
I guess she went
from Paris to Miami.

55:58.062 --> 56:01.831
Yeah. They look a little
too friendly to be friends.

56:01.866 --> 56:04.967
Explains why she wasn't
returning my texts.

56:05.003 --> 56:06.513
I guess she wants to be
on the winning team.

56:06.537 --> 56:09.705
- I'm sorry.
- Guess her trip's off.

56:09.741 --> 56:13.142
Something tells me that she wouldn't
have enjoyed it much here anyway.

56:15.580 --> 56:18.714
- Yeah... probably not.
- Probably not.

56:20.918 --> 56:24.854
You know, we have
a couple of hours.

56:24.889 --> 56:27.556
Maybe we could both
use a change of scenery.

56:36.901 --> 56:39.201
- I remember this path.
- I hope so!

56:39.237 --> 56:41.470
We came here almost
every week after school.

56:41.506 --> 56:44.674
Yeah, we'd hide underneath a tree
and I'd try to steal a kiss.

56:46.711 --> 56:48.978
Plan your escape from this town.

56:51.816 --> 56:53.349
Our escape.

56:58.856 --> 57:02.358
This town always gave me
a reason to stay.

57:03.685 --> 57:07.163
First, grandpa...
And then my parents.

57:07.198 --> 57:09.498
And then Davis.

57:09.534 --> 57:11.867
I think, deep down,
I was just scared.

57:13.137 --> 57:15.371
Happens to the best of us.

57:17.909 --> 57:20.309
No way.

57:25.616 --> 57:27.683
I can't believe
this is still here.

57:27.719 --> 57:33.189
"J & C forever"?
That was a little overly optimistic.

57:34.392 --> 57:37.793
Maybe the game isn't over yet.

57:40.865 --> 57:42.031
Hold on. Sorry.

57:45.203 --> 57:49.205
It's your mom.
They're done painting the truck.

57:49.240 --> 57:50.240
Okay.

57:50.308 --> 57:54.777
- Isn't it great?
- Yeah, it's fantastic.

57:54.812 --> 57:56.612
The kitchen's still
a work-in-progress,

57:56.647 --> 57:58.258
but I say we load it up
with stuff from the diner,

57:58.282 --> 58:00.683
and take this baby
out for a test run.

58:00.718 --> 58:02.885
Maybe even field-test
some new menu items.

58:02.954 --> 58:04.687
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah.

58:04.722 --> 58:06.689
Where do you think
should be our first stop?

58:08.726 --> 58:11.127
I know just the place.

58:15.066 --> 58:17.032
An empanada, please.

58:17.068 --> 58:18.734
Okay. Hey, guys.
Empanada.

58:20.138 --> 58:22.104
There's more
where that came from.

58:22.140 --> 58:24.840
- Three corn dogs then, please.
- Three corn dogs.

58:26.110 --> 58:28.344
Is that Chase Taynor
serving burgers?

58:28.379 --> 58:29.379
It is!

58:29.447 --> 58:32.148
Would he be willing to autograph
my hamburger in mustard?

58:32.183 --> 58:34.484
He will!
Yes.

58:35.820 --> 58:38.320
There's a first time
for everything, right?

58:39.457 --> 58:40.457
Fancy!

58:43.194 --> 58:44.894
Enjoy!

58:46.030 --> 58:50.599
- What is this?
- Well, hello, Charlie!

58:50.635 --> 58:53.669
A rolling diner
with a celebrity chef? Really?

58:53.704 --> 58:59.041
But didn't you say a little competition
raises the bar for everyone?

58:59.110 --> 59:01.277
Would you like a corndog, sir?

59:02.513 --> 59:05.681
No. I wouldn't like a corndog.
Thank you.

59:06.984 --> 59:08.884
A celebrity chef.

59:11.222 --> 59:13.622
Do you cater?
My company picnic's coming up.

59:13.658 --> 59:17.927
Yes! We do, and also, we love seeing
old friends back at Wesley's diner.

59:17.962 --> 59:20.596
In fact, tomorrow
is the grand re-opening,

59:20.631 --> 59:22.798
and we're debuting
new items on the menu,

59:22.834 --> 59:25.634
so, everyone, please come,
and tell all of your friends.

59:25.670 --> 59:28.304
Thank you so much!
We're all out.

59:28.339 --> 59:30.773
Let's go back to the diner,
we'll restock,

59:30.808 --> 59:32.508
and then we'll take
a trip around town.

59:32.543 --> 59:33.776
- Okay.
- Yeah?

59:33.811 --> 59:34.844
Yeah!

59:34.879 --> 59:36.679
- Thanks, guys!
- Thank you!

59:41.522 --> 59:44.490
Well, guys. Thanks for today.
That was fun.

59:44.525 --> 59:45.657
Yeah!

59:49.563 --> 59:51.897
And thanks for helping me
mend the fences with my dad.

59:51.966 --> 59:54.232
It's the least I could do.

59:58.806 --> 01:00:01.506
Don't forget, the auction's tonight.

01:00:01.542 --> 01:00:03.542
- Yeah. I'll be there.
- 'Kay.

01:00:03.577 --> 01:00:04.577
See you later, bud.

01:00:04.645 --> 01:00:07.379
- Bye!
- Bye.

01:00:08.849 --> 01:00:12.317
Hey, Chase.
Look what your mother found.

01:00:12.353 --> 01:00:15.687
This is my junior high school paper.

01:00:15.723 --> 01:00:18.357
Yeah, you took the team
all the way to state that year.

01:00:18.392 --> 01:00:22.394
And that... Is the first time you
were mentioned in a real newspaper.

01:00:22.463 --> 01:00:25.063
That's when I signed my first contract.

01:00:25.132 --> 01:00:29.334
The tickets stubs, everything there
from your first game.

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:31.703
I didn't know you were there.

01:00:31.739 --> 01:00:33.405
Why didn't you tell me?

01:00:33.474 --> 01:00:35.974
We didn't want to throw you off
on your big day.

01:00:37.077 --> 01:00:40.345
Why haven't you
shown me this before now?

01:00:40.381 --> 01:00:42.981
Well, your mom always
puffed you up so much,

01:00:43.017 --> 01:00:45.384
I figured it was my job
to keep you grounded.

01:00:47.454 --> 01:00:50.222
I don't wear
my heart on my sleeve,

01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:52.290
but I've always
been proud of you.

01:00:52.326 --> 01:00:54.326
You chased your dreams.

01:00:59.366 --> 01:01:02.000
What's really
bothering you, son?

01:01:04.571 --> 01:01:08.006
I guess I just don't know what
to hope for these days...

01:01:08.042 --> 01:01:11.043
I've spent 15 years
building my career, and...

01:01:11.405 --> 01:01:17.149
Lately, I'm afraid to check my messages
'cause I don't know what I want to hear.

01:01:17.184 --> 01:01:18.550
Afraid?

01:01:18.619 --> 01:01:22.320
That's not a word we hear much
from you.

01:01:22.356 --> 01:01:24.956
You always made
your dreams happen.

01:01:24.992 --> 01:01:28.527
Don't give up on them now.
Whatever they are.

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:32.164
Thanks, dad.

01:01:39.106 --> 01:01:42.007
- Is mom painting us over there?
- Yes, she is.

01:01:46.947 --> 01:01:48.980
And congratulations
to Becky's best pies,

01:01:49.016 --> 01:01:51.650
the winner of this year's
pie contest!

01:01:51.685 --> 01:01:54.453
Okay, everyone, it's time
for tonight's big auction!

01:01:56.523 --> 01:01:58.523
Come on, folks!
It's for the school,

01:01:58.559 --> 01:02:00.992
and I see a lot
of bad haircuts out there.

01:02:01.028 --> 01:02:05.797
So do I hear $40 for a deluxe
styling from Betty's hair salon?

01:02:05.833 --> 01:02:07.766
$10.

01:02:07.801 --> 01:02:11.837
Going once, going twice...
Sold!

01:02:13.774 --> 01:02:16.041
Not exactly raising a mint here.

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:17.609
The bids are almost over.

01:02:17.644 --> 01:02:18.510
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:02:18.545 --> 01:02:20.712
- Hey.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

01:02:20.781 --> 01:02:23.782
I didn't know what to bring,
so I just brought some options.

01:02:23.817 --> 01:02:24.783
What do you think
for the auction...

01:02:24.818 --> 01:02:27.319
I got signed baseballs,
a Jersey...

01:02:27.354 --> 01:02:29.454
I have a glove in there as well.

01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:31.690
Whatever you guys...
Whatever you guys need.

01:02:31.725 --> 01:02:34.326
Really?
Anything?

01:02:37.831 --> 01:02:39.331
What are you thinking?

01:02:39.366 --> 01:02:42.434
We had an idea
of how you could help.

01:02:44.705 --> 01:02:46.772
We can auction you off.

01:02:50.677 --> 01:02:51.677
You're joking.

01:02:55.382 --> 01:02:58.984
- I guess it's for a good cause.
- Thank you!

01:03:01.288 --> 01:03:02.854
We're gonna auction off Chase.

01:03:04.191 --> 01:03:06.291
Please bring the next item
to the podium.

01:03:06.326 --> 01:03:07.592
That's you!

01:03:14.101 --> 01:03:19.171
Our final item for auction is Parker Falls'
most famous former resident.

01:03:19.206 --> 01:03:22.774
Sure, he's got a few dings,
but he shines up okay.

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:26.678
So, what's the first bid for
a dance date with a hometown hero?

01:03:26.713 --> 01:03:27.713
$20!

01:03:28.816 --> 01:03:30.482
$50!

01:03:30.517 --> 01:03:32.952
- Do I hear 100?
- $100!

01:03:33.787 --> 01:03:34.787
120!

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:36.454
140.

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:37.923
140!

01:03:39.993 --> 01:03:41.126
Going once...

01:03:42.663 --> 01:03:43.628
Going twice...

01:03:43.664 --> 01:03:44.863
Can we bid as a group?

01:03:46.166 --> 01:03:47.999
I don't see why not.

01:03:50.604 --> 01:03:52.637
$300... and 12!

01:03:54.942 --> 01:03:59.611
$312! Going once!
Twice! Sold!

01:04:07.955 --> 01:04:10.689
- I don't know if I like the looks of this.
- Me neither.

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:18.663
At least it's for a good cause.

01:04:18.699 --> 01:04:20.365
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:04:20.434 --> 01:04:22.434
And, really, you
shouldn't be surprised.

01:04:22.469 --> 01:04:24.469
This town always gets
in everyone's business.

01:04:27.407 --> 01:04:31.176
Well, just so half the town
doesn't feel cheated...

01:04:32.479 --> 01:04:34.946
Any chance you want to dance?

01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:37.649
Let's dance.

01:04:49.263 --> 01:04:52.530
This takes me back.

01:04:52.599 --> 01:04:54.499
The lights, the music...

01:04:59.139 --> 01:05:01.106
And you.

01:05:03.277 --> 01:05:05.310
Maybe you can go home again.

01:05:31.772 --> 01:05:34.105
Come on. Let's get ready
for our grand re-opening.

01:06:21.822 --> 01:06:24.122
This what it feels like
before a big game?

01:06:24.157 --> 01:06:25.457
Pretty much.

01:06:32.499 --> 01:06:34.165
How do I look?

01:06:41.475 --> 01:06:43.441
Perfect.

01:06:44.611 --> 01:06:46.778
Guys?
I think it's time.

01:06:52.652 --> 01:06:56.121
- Okay.
- You've got this.

01:07:01.928 --> 01:07:04.462
I'd say we got the word out.

01:07:04.498 --> 01:07:06.831
I'd say we did!

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:11.803
Thank you, guys, so much.
For everything!

01:07:12.973 --> 01:07:16.408
- Group hug!
- Yeah!

01:07:19.646 --> 01:07:24.115
Come in! Hi!
Welcome to the new Wesley's.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.253
So many... people.

01:07:33.694 --> 01:07:37.229
Charlie?
What a surprise.

01:07:37.264 --> 01:07:39.798
- Isn't your restaurant open tonight?
- Of course.

01:07:39.867 --> 01:07:44.669
I just thought I would turn out to
help support a fellow restaurateur,

01:07:44.705 --> 01:07:47.272
and, you know, scope out
the local competition.

01:07:49.409 --> 01:07:53.178
Well, I hope you enjoy!
Let me show you to your table.

01:07:55.515 --> 01:07:58.750
- I think we did it, kiddo.
- We sure did.

01:07:58.785 --> 01:07:59.918
How's this?

01:07:59.953 --> 01:08:01.186
Perfect.

01:08:01.221 --> 01:08:03.388
Well, I'm gonna go
check on that stew, okay?

01:08:23.777 --> 01:08:25.076
Hey, Spence.

01:08:25.112 --> 01:08:27.245
Hey, Chase!
I got news.

01:08:27.281 --> 01:08:29.180
<i>You are officially back.</i>

01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:32.517
<i>Chase? You listening?</i>

01:08:32.551 --> 01:08:33.952
You're back in business!

01:08:35.122 --> 01:08:38.122
Back? Back where? Boston?

01:08:38.191 --> 01:08:40.492
Better than that.
Southern California.

01:08:40.527 --> 01:08:42.359
And they want you there Friday.

01:08:45.999 --> 01:08:48.234
You are on your way.
Start packing those bags, pal,

01:08:48.268 --> 01:08:50.535
<i>because you are
back in the game.</i>

01:08:51.872 --> 01:08:54.238
<i>Chase? Hello?</i>

01:08:54.274 --> 01:08:55.318
Chase, buddy. Listen to me.

01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:58.209
<i>Second chances like this
don't come by every day.</i>

01:08:58.245 --> 01:08:59.778
I'm gonna call you back,
okay, Spence?

01:09:04.917 --> 01:09:06.785
How's the stew coming?

01:09:08.854 --> 01:09:10.555
You okay?

01:09:11.858 --> 01:09:17.696
- Yeah. Yeah, it's just my game face.
- Okay. Well, come on. Chop-chop.

01:09:17.731 --> 01:09:19.663
Stir-stir. We have
a full house out there.

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.765
Okay. Yeah. All right, boss.

01:09:36.218 --> 01:09:37.917
So what'd you think?

01:09:37.987 --> 01:09:40.754
- It was okay.
- Just okay?

01:09:40.823 --> 01:09:44.892
Well, actually, the risotto was...
Superb.

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:48.729
That means a lot
coming from you.

01:09:48.764 --> 01:09:51.064
Looks like the competition
just upped its game a bit.

01:09:52.702 --> 01:09:54.835
A little competition
never hurt anyone.

01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:57.771
I have a feeling
we're both gonna be just fine.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.042
- Good night, Charlie.
- Good night, Jessica.

01:10:07.717 --> 01:10:09.717
We did it.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.820
We did it!

01:10:15.825 --> 01:10:17.391
Well, I should probably go.

01:10:17.426 --> 01:10:21.495
No! It's 9:00.
Celebrate with me.

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:25.599
Kiwi tarts and ice cream,
then Spring Fling?

01:10:27.002 --> 01:10:29.837
I wish I could, but...

01:10:29.872 --> 01:10:32.740
You know, you should be
really proud of yourself.

01:10:32.808 --> 01:10:34.975
You took a big risk.

01:10:35.010 --> 01:10:37.511
And I think it paid off.

01:10:38.914 --> 01:10:40.981
Thank you, for everything.

01:11:01.637 --> 01:11:03.704
How'd it go tonight?

01:11:05.407 --> 01:11:08.308
Perfect.

01:11:08.344 --> 01:11:10.377
So why the long face?

01:11:12.214 --> 01:11:17.151
I got an offer, dad.
In Southern California.

01:11:17.186 --> 01:11:21.722
- Fantastic!
- It's complicated.

01:11:21.757 --> 01:11:24.491
Jessica?

01:11:25.761 --> 01:11:27.227
Yeah, I thought as much.

01:11:27.263 --> 01:11:30.063
- How soon you gotta be there?
- Friday.

01:11:30.824 --> 01:11:36.001
And, if you go, we won't know
if, or when, you'll be back, right?

01:11:37.006 --> 01:11:40.174
I see, that's
a pretty serious problem.

01:11:40.209 --> 01:11:44.211
Yeah, and I promised Wesley I'd play in
the father/son baseball game this Friday.

01:11:44.246 --> 01:11:47.014
So no matter what ya do,
something's got to give.

01:11:49.318 --> 01:11:51.485
You know, dad,

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.422
I don't usually ask your advice,
but what should I do?

01:11:55.491 --> 01:11:57.624
That's a tough one.

01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:02.029
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life,
even a few with your mother.

01:12:02.064 --> 01:12:03.197
Really?

01:12:03.232 --> 01:12:07.067
Did you know I almost
didn't ask her to marry me?

01:12:07.136 --> 01:12:09.136
I bought the ring and all,
but then I got an offer

01:12:09.171 --> 01:12:11.638
to work a pit crew
in north Carolina.

01:12:11.674 --> 01:12:15.375
Then what happened?
How'd you make a decision?

01:12:15.411 --> 01:12:17.044
Well, simple, eventually.

01:12:17.079 --> 01:12:19.413
I got out a piece of paper
and I wrote down

01:12:19.481 --> 01:12:22.649
everything I had to gain, everything
I had to lose if I took the job.

01:12:22.685 --> 01:12:24.318
What'd you have on the list?

01:12:24.353 --> 01:12:30.657
One column was full. It was...
More money, opportunity, travel.

01:12:30.693 --> 01:12:33.994
The other column
only had one word in it.

01:12:35.631 --> 01:12:37.064
What was the word?

01:12:38.901 --> 01:12:40.868
"Lindy".

01:12:40.903 --> 01:12:46.139
I realized the only column that mattered
was the one that had her name on it.

01:12:46.175 --> 01:12:51.712
Most things in life that seem
complicated are really pretty simple

01:12:51.747 --> 01:12:53.146
when you take a good, hard look.

01:13:08.063 --> 01:13:10.697
Ready for the most important
job in the world?

01:13:10.733 --> 01:13:14.368
More important than
cleaning the deep-fryer?

01:13:14.403 --> 01:13:17.037
Run this down to the bank.

01:13:17.072 --> 01:13:20.173
It has been a long time
since we have been in the black.

01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:22.175
I will guard it with my life.

01:13:26.048 --> 01:13:27.447
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:13:29.318 --> 01:13:30.350
Hey, Jess.

01:13:30.386 --> 01:13:32.286
Hey!

01:13:34.123 --> 01:13:36.957
- I need to tell you something.
- Okay.

01:13:36.992 --> 01:13:40.127
It's kind of important.
Is Wes here?

01:13:40.162 --> 01:13:42.029
No, I dropped him at school.

01:13:42.064 --> 01:13:45.999
He's so excited about the father/son
game, that he left his lunch in the car.

01:13:47.636 --> 01:13:49.403
He is so proud
that you're his partner,

01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:53.707
he wanted to get to school early
to remind all of his friends.

01:13:53.776 --> 01:13:55.475
So, what's going on?

01:13:57.813 --> 01:14:01.982
Well, I got an offer coming in,

01:14:02.017 --> 01:14:05.452
and they want to fly me to
California to talk about my future.

01:14:13.963 --> 01:14:16.163
That is amazing!

01:14:16.198 --> 01:14:17.731
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

01:14:18.968 --> 01:14:21.168
There's one more thing.

01:14:22.438 --> 01:14:24.204
They want me there now.

01:14:25.374 --> 01:14:27.474
Now? Well, well, how soon is now?

01:14:27.509 --> 01:14:31.445
- Friday.
- Wait. This Friday?

01:14:32.548 --> 01:14:33.981
Yeah.

01:14:34.016 --> 01:14:38.185
- That is sudden.
- I'm in shock, too.

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:41.655
And Wesley's game on Friday...

01:14:43.726 --> 01:14:47.160
I... I'm so...

01:14:47.196 --> 01:14:49.196
No. Hey.
It's okay. It's okay!

01:14:49.264 --> 01:14:53.800
These things happen,
and I'm so happy for you.

01:14:53.836 --> 01:14:56.603
And Wesley is going to be
really happy for you, too.

01:14:57.973 --> 01:14:59.651
I just... I didn't want it
to go like this, you know?

01:14:59.675 --> 01:15:00.540
I know.

01:15:00.609 --> 01:15:04.378
You deserve a second chance.
And you got one!

01:15:06.882 --> 01:15:11.451
And thank you for reminding me
that I can dream big, too.

01:15:15.457 --> 01:15:17.924
- Look...
- I gotta go.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.993
I need
to get Wesley his lunch.

01:15:20.029 --> 01:15:22.662
Well, maybe I'll come with you.
I'd love to explain to Wes...

01:15:22.698 --> 01:15:24.798
I think it's... I need
to just handle it myself.

01:15:24.833 --> 01:15:26.666
- But...
- Trust me.

01:15:26.702 --> 01:15:29.469
I've been there before.

01:15:29.505 --> 01:15:31.038
Congratulations.

01:15:37.379 --> 01:15:40.714
So I told Tommy that Chase is
gonna play in the father-son game,

01:15:40.783 --> 01:15:44.351
and he's so jealous.
It's awesome!

01:15:47.022 --> 01:15:49.956
Yeah, buddy...
About that.

01:15:51.627 --> 01:15:55.495
There's... there's been
a bit of a complication.

01:15:55.531 --> 01:15:57.864
What do you mean?

01:15:57.933 --> 01:16:01.935
Well, it looks like
Chase is going to California,

01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:04.871
and that, they're
gonna make an offer.

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:07.641
Yes!
That is so cool!

01:16:07.676 --> 01:16:08.708
I know.

01:16:08.777 --> 01:16:12.679
- I told him to just be patient.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:16:12.748 --> 01:16:15.182
Well, that is
the really cool part.

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:21.321
But, the uncool part is that it looks
like he's got to be there tomorrow.

01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:24.958
The same night as your game.

01:16:24.993 --> 01:16:29.796
So...
He won't be at our game?

01:16:30.866 --> 01:16:33.767
No.
But you know what?

01:16:33.802 --> 01:16:36.636
He said he'd come back
at the end of the season,

01:16:36.672 --> 01:16:39.639
and maybe we could go up to Cleveland
and watch him play this summer.

01:16:39.675 --> 01:16:43.410
- Wouldn't that be fun?
- I don't want to.

01:16:43.445 --> 01:16:46.012
Aw, Wesley...

01:16:46.081 --> 01:16:48.782
Everybody makes promises
'cause it's easy,

01:16:48.817 --> 01:16:51.118
but it's also easy
to break them.

01:16:51.153 --> 01:16:54.287
I know.
I know this really stinks.

01:16:54.323 --> 01:16:56.189
Everyone at school
is gonna laugh at me.

01:16:56.258 --> 01:16:58.625
No, they won't.
Not if they're your real friends.

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:01.461
I thought Chase
was my real friend.

01:17:01.497 --> 01:17:03.930
Hey. Hey-hey-hey.

01:17:03.966 --> 01:17:06.166
He is your real friend.

01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:07.767
But sometimes, even friends

01:17:07.803 --> 01:17:09.636
have to do things
that they don't want to do.

01:17:17.415 --> 01:17:22.351
You know, I'm actual surprised.
I thought I was all washed up.

01:17:22.386 --> 01:17:24.953
Well, I am so proud of you, son.

01:17:25.022 --> 01:17:26.522
It's just...

01:17:27.625 --> 01:17:28.957
It's just what?

01:17:29.026 --> 01:17:32.494
We see how happy
you already are... here.

01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:34.396
It's true, mom, I know.

01:17:35.833 --> 01:17:37.433
But this is my shot.

01:17:37.501 --> 01:17:40.736
Yeah, we get it, son.
It's just...

01:17:40.771 --> 01:17:43.238
Jessica is one in a million.

01:17:43.274 --> 01:17:48.043
And we're a little afraid that
if you go, you won't come back.

01:17:48.079 --> 01:17:51.180
I'll be back.
I promise.

01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:53.949
Well...

01:17:54.018 --> 01:17:55.784
You better get a move on it, then.

01:17:55.853 --> 01:17:57.252
You don't want to miss your flight.

01:18:01.225 --> 01:18:02.558
Come here, mom.

01:18:04.261 --> 01:18:05.994
I'll miss you.

01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:07.030
It's okay.
I'll be back.

01:18:19.743 --> 01:18:23.212
I know homework is important,
but how about a break?

01:18:23.247 --> 01:18:25.047
Thanks, mom.

01:18:25.082 --> 01:18:27.749
So...

01:18:27.785 --> 01:18:30.486
Think Chase is gone yet?

01:18:30.521 --> 01:18:32.855
I'm not sure.

01:18:32.890 --> 01:18:35.357
But just know that
I'm not going anywhere.

01:18:35.392 --> 01:18:37.226
Okay?

01:18:37.261 --> 01:18:39.261
Okay.

01:18:41.565 --> 01:18:43.499
Hey, I was thinking.

01:18:43.534 --> 01:18:45.400
If business keeps
going like this,

01:18:45.436 --> 01:18:48.170
maybe we can take
a vacation this summer,

01:18:48.205 --> 01:18:51.273
visit a few of those places
we've been reading about?

01:18:51.342 --> 01:18:53.175
You bet, mom.

01:20:26.804 --> 01:20:28.870
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:20:28.906 --> 01:20:34.910
<i>welcome to the 42nd annual Parker
Falls father/son baseball game!</i>

01:20:34.979 --> 01:20:37.980
<i>Playing on the blue team,
Scott and Mike Smith,</i>

01:20:38.015 --> 01:20:41.984
<i>Steve and Finch Monroe,
Gordon and Ronnie Runyan,</i>

01:20:42.019 --> 01:20:45.887
<i>Jeff and Cole Campbell.
Ben and Brian Callahan.</i>

01:20:45.923 --> 01:20:48.323
<i>And Jessica and Wesley Parker!</i>

01:20:48.359 --> 01:20:50.125
You okay, Wes?

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.661
I know you wanted
Chase to be here.

01:20:52.696 --> 01:20:55.731
I'm just glad you're here, mom.

01:20:59.737 --> 01:21:02.704
<i>Hold on!
There's one more player!</i>

01:21:18.322 --> 01:21:20.122
You're a little late.

01:21:20.157 --> 01:21:26.295
Well, I'm sorry, but...
I had a bit of a busy day.

01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:27.529
What'd you come back for?

01:21:27.564 --> 01:21:28.530
Two reasons.

01:21:28.565 --> 01:21:29.565
You...

01:21:30.734 --> 01:21:32.668
And you.

01:21:36.407 --> 01:21:38.874
And what happens after the game?

01:21:38.909 --> 01:21:42.844
I accepted a new offer...
One where I'm not a pitcher.

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.579
I don't understand.

01:21:44.648 --> 01:21:47.783
Well, it turns out they wanted
to hire me as a pitching coach,

01:21:47.818 --> 01:21:49.184
so I made them a counter-offer.

01:21:49.219 --> 01:21:51.853
To...

01:21:51.889 --> 01:21:56.191
Be a scout for the Midwest...
Based in Parker Falls.

01:21:57.394 --> 01:22:00.996
- Are you serious?
- Well, yeah!

01:22:01.031 --> 01:22:02.531
You know I got an eye for talent.

01:22:02.566 --> 01:22:05.378
And, besides, the traffic is
much better here than over there.

01:22:05.402 --> 01:22:07.669
And I can make
my own schedule, so...

01:22:07.705 --> 01:22:09.071
So?

01:22:09.139 --> 01:22:13.342
So I figured, since
Wesley's coach is retiring...

01:22:13.377 --> 01:22:16.111
- I could maybe step in.
- That's awesome!

01:22:21.185 --> 01:22:22.617
Not a lot of privacy
in this town.

01:22:26.657 --> 01:22:29.391
Well, looks like
the crowd still loves you.

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:31.626
I think they're cheering for you.

01:22:41.338 --> 01:22:43.271
Yeah, buddy!
