00:00.730 --> 00:02.230
Hello everyone

00:02.240 --> 00:06.930
I'm so happy to see all of you
and to welcome you to season four

00:07.100 --> 00:11.490
which is of course the name of the restaurant
the number one asian fusion restaurant in new york

00:11.500 --> 00:15.880
We'll be eating the number one selling food In
the rest of america.

00:18.260 --> 00:21.170
- What it is?
- All right! Cheesy blasters.

00:21.180 --> 00:25.580
?You take a hot dog Stuff it with
some jack cheese Fold it in a pizza ?

00:25.770 --> 00:27.600
?You got cheesy blasters ?

00:27.620 --> 00:29.360
And then all the kids
say, "thanks, meat cat."

00:29.380 --> 00:32.200
And then meat cat flies away
on his, um, skateboard.

00:32.210 --> 00:33.930
I can't eat this. I'm a foodie.

00:33.940 --> 00:37.410
These cheesy blasters are
here to teach us a lesson.

00:37.420 --> 00:41.690
The economy is struggling and your
parent company is struggling with it why?

00:41.700 --> 00:46.100
Because we've lost tou with the
heartland, consumers, with the real america.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.810
Ay, that's a vonsense term
all of america is america.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.360
Like it or not, you are all part of the elite.

00:51.390 --> 00:54.340
When was the last time any of
you worked for the minimum wage?

00:55.080 --> 00:58.990
Well, before i made it as a stand-up,
i was a bucketrummer in the subway.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.400
- That's not a real job.
- Oh, yeah?

01:00.410 --> 01:03.620
Then how come i got sued
for sexual harassment at it?

01:03.630 --> 01:08.180
Acy, you may come from humble beginnings,
but yove been rich for a long time.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.170
I think it's affecting your act.

01:10.180 --> 01:13.500
You know how on St. Barth's people
be eating they lobster like this?

01:18.510 --> 01:20.290
Don't look at me in the eyes!

01:20.300 --> 01:22.590
Have i lost touch with my roots?

01:23.470 --> 01:25.830
I better talk to rabbi
shmuley about this.

01:25.860 --> 01:29.540
Jack, if it would help the show,
i would be willing to "go country."

01:29.550 --> 01:31.440
- Really?
- "go country"?What does that mean?

01:31.450 --> 01:33.570
It's a totally legitimate career move, Liz

01:33.600 --> 01:37.290
the best way for a lady to get heat in
this in is to either record a country album

01:37.300 --> 01:38.980
or have a lesbian relationship.

01:38.990 --> 01:41.940
We'll start with going
country. To "tgs."

01:41.950 --> 01:45.480
We'll trick those racecar-loving
wide loads into watching your lefty,

01:45.510 --> 01:48.360
Homoerotic propaganda hour yet.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.670
You just don't like anybody, do you?

01:50.840 --> 01:52.010
Well...

02:14.610 --> 02:17.630
Lemon, how soon can you
start the talent search?

02:17.660 --> 02:18.720
What talent search?

02:18.730 --> 02:21.920
"tgs" needs to find someone who
can appeal to a broader audience.

02:21.950 --> 02:25.320
Those two do not test
well outside the cities.

02:25.340 --> 02:27.960
Oh, he's burning money again.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.810
- What about josh?
- Right, josh. I forgot about that guy.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.150
You think that's a good sign?

02:34.170 --> 02:37.110
Oh, jack, please don't make
me look for a new cast member.

02:37.130 --> 02:39.520
You make these pronouncements
on a whim and then i have to--

02:39.540 --> 02:41.250
Lemon, this is a financial necessity.

02:41.270 --> 02:44.520
Every division of the company is
reaching out to the middle of the country.

02:44.560 --> 02:47.420
Our new mammogram machine is
called the "git 'er done 2000."

02:49.500 --> 02:53.400
Another actor? Why? They have
so many feelings and opinions.

02:53.830 --> 02:57.150
All right, fine. I'll make reservations
for us at some stand-up clubs.

02:57.380 --> 02:59.550
But don't tell anyone.

02:59.570 --> 03:03.840
Are you kidding me? Remember when jenna thought
that blonde intern wanted to be an actress?

03:04.200 --> 03:08.610
I'm studying acting and singing and
someday i'm gonna be just like you.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.550
I never did find her earlobe.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.660
- No one can know about this.
- Know about what?

03:16.960 --> 03:19.120
- Pete's stealing money.
- Liz's uterus fell out.

03:20.410 --> 03:22.660
I think i already knew that.

03:26.010 --> 03:27.870
Thank you, kenneth.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.640
Sir, i have a problem with my time card.

03:31.670 --> 03:35.650
So naturally you came to me because
this company is just the two of us.

03:35.660 --> 03:40.140
I received a memo saying that pages are no
longer allowed to work more than 16 hours a day.

03:40.160 --> 03:45.280
Yes, kenneth. Thanks to comrade obama's
recession, we've had to cut overtime for pages.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.230
Oh, it's not the money, sir.

03:47.260 --> 03:50.250
It's just that i always
work more than 16 hours.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.590
So i would be signing my name to a lie.

03:53.630 --> 03:58.900
The parcell name is synonymous
with honesty as the hill people say,

03:58.910 --> 04:02.620
"parcell, gon' say
del go up del saw say."

04:04.340 --> 04:07.250
We've all had to make
sacrifices, kenneth.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.870
I had to downsize the payroll department
to one guy and an envelope-stuffing machine.

04:12.810 --> 04:15.140
Today's my birthday.

04:15.490 --> 04:18.380
You can hand in an accurate time
card as soon as we can pay for it.

04:18.390 --> 04:21.570
But trust me, we literally
have no extra money.

04:21.589 --> 04:24.390
So do your part. Sign your time card.

04:31.510 --> 04:33.980
"dah don say da bay ton daw."

04:38.380 --> 04:40.640
Kenneth. Boop.

04:40.650 --> 04:43.560
- Thank you, sir.
- Elizabeth, i have your paycheck.

04:43.810 --> 04:45.650
Thank you, peter.

04:51.130 --> 04:53.040
All right, we're on for
8:00 at the stand-up cellar,

04:53.080 --> 04:55.090
Then we're going to nyu
to see that improv troupe.

04:55.110 --> 04:58.600
Okay, i guess we leave separately and
then meet there? I hate being sneaky.

04:58.610 --> 05:02.400
Luckily everybody here is dumb
and you and i are good at lying.

05:02.410 --> 05:04.550
What are you two
lovebirds whispering about?

05:04.580 --> 05:05.920
- Nothing.
- Uterus nothing.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.350
Geez. I was just joking.

05:12.490 --> 05:14.190
I blame you and dotcom.

05:14.210 --> 05:18.970
You two have built a protective shell around
me like a hermit crab or a mermaid booby.

05:19.020 --> 05:21.820
And now i've lost touch
with the common man.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.020
Who's that?

05:24.030 --> 05:25.970
This is rolly the custodian.

05:25.990 --> 05:28.430
You said you wanted an ordinary
person to reconnect with.

05:28.450 --> 05:31.290
Oh, hey, guy. Come on in.

05:33.180 --> 05:36.040
- So, rolly, where you from?
- Brooklyn.

05:36.050 --> 05:37.410
Right on, my brother.

05:37.460 --> 05:40.470
My dear friend moby opened
up a tea house in park slope.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.280
Does he know you?

05:46.050 --> 05:50.470
- Hey, rolly, you ever lose your remote control?
- Yeah.

05:51.650 --> 05:55.340
And then your wife start getting
all mad because the roof won't close

05:55.350 --> 05:59.140
And the bed that's in the shape
of your face is getting rained on?

06:01.760 --> 06:03.420
I like you, rolly.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.230
Can i feel the rough skin on your hands?

06:07.870 --> 06:09.830
Sorry about that.

06:12.270 --> 06:14.160
What do you mean that was weird?

06:14.180 --> 06:16.310
You've sheltered me too much.

06:16.340 --> 06:20.930
I'm going out on the street and i
don't want nobody to follow me. Nobody!

06:21.400 --> 06:25.040
Um, which one is the
elevator i'm not afraid of?

06:25.880 --> 06:27.820
Right!

06:35.660 --> 06:39.820
I think the machine gave
me someone else's paycheck.

06:40.580 --> 06:42.940
"john francis donaghy."

06:42.970 --> 06:45.540
Hey, he's got a girl's middle name too.

06:49.720 --> 06:54.060
But he said sacrifice...
And no overtime.

06:54.610 --> 06:56.860
So many zeros.

07:01.460 --> 07:03.900
I thought you were leaving
ten minutes ago of me.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.890
Oh, well, we're going two
separate places, so it's not weird.

07:06.910 --> 07:09.200
No, nothing's ever weird now.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.690
Oh, hey, liz. You want to share a cab?

07:13.700 --> 07:19.980
I can't. I'm picking up my
nutritionist and his elderly son, so.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.090
Pete, are you driving uptown?

07:23.100 --> 07:25.840
Love you too! Bye!

07:33.270 --> 07:34.790
Good morning, mr. Donaghy.

07:34.820 --> 07:37.690
I would like to speak to you
on behalf of all the nbc pages.

07:37.710 --> 07:40.160
I'll give you a new york
minute. That's seven seconds.

07:40.540 --> 07:45.590
Well, sir, we pages and i feel that me
and they are not being treated fairly

07:45.600 --> 07:48.460
as regards paychecking. I'm nervous.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.120
We demand that you give
us back our overtime.

07:51.140 --> 07:53.430
We went over this yesterday,
kenneth. There's no money.

07:53.440 --> 07:57.110
Sir, i accidentally saw your paycheck.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.040
Well, i hope it was inspirational.

08:00.060 --> 08:03.380
All those zeros. It's
downright un-american.

08:03.390 --> 08:06.580
That's where you're wrong,
kenneth. It's extremely american.

08:06.590 --> 08:09.540
My talents are more valuable than
yours, so i'm paid accordingly.

08:09.570 --> 08:12.100
Therefore, i'm entitled to my bonus.

08:12.130 --> 08:15.780
That's a bonus check? You
said there was no extra money.

08:15.790 --> 08:17.940
"bonus" means "extra."

08:17.950 --> 08:20.760
I know that from game shows.

08:20.770 --> 08:22.530
You lied to me.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.670
I didn't lie, kenneth.
I massaged the truth.

08:26.650 --> 08:28.940
What do you need to move past this?

08:28.950 --> 08:33.799
Well, sir, you made a liar out of
me by making me sign that time card.

08:33.809 --> 08:39.600
I would like you to sign your name to a piece
of paper that says, "i'm a big ol' liar."

08:40.039 --> 08:41.470
I'm not doing that.

08:41.490 --> 08:45.290
Well, then we pages have no
choice but to go on strike!

08:45.610 --> 08:48.270
I like you, kenneth, but you do
not want to mess with me right now.

08:48.290 --> 08:51.170
I am in the middle of a raging period...

08:51.180 --> 08:52.650
Of economic turmoil.

08:52.670 --> 08:55.980
Too late, sir! Page strike!

09:00.310 --> 09:02.350
I will wait.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.950
Ken! How do i get out of this building?

09:10.580 --> 09:12.710
- What do we want?
- To get you sandwiches.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.540
- When do we want it?
- Whenever would Be convenient for you.

09:15.550 --> 09:17.950
- What do we want?
- To get you sandwiches.

09:17.960 --> 09:21.080
- When do we want it?
- Whenever would Be convenient for you.

09:21.090 --> 09:23.410
- What do we want?
- To get you sandwiches.

09:23.420 --> 09:26.590
- When do we want it?
- Whenever would Be convenient for you.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.130
- What do we want?
- To get you sandwiches.

09:29.890 --> 09:31.360
Lemon, how's our talent search going?

09:31.370 --> 09:32.360
The worst.

09:32.380 --> 09:35.250
I'm lying to everybody about something
i don't even want to be doing.

09:35.270 --> 09:39.510
Pete and i keep accidentally touching
knees under those little comedy club tables.

09:39.800 --> 09:43.540
What is a new cast member--
shut up! Shut up! Here it comes.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.300
Good morning, y'all.

09:45.310 --> 09:47.850
Well, who's this southern peach?

09:47.860 --> 09:49.730
Do you know the song are
you ready for some football?

09:49.760 --> 09:52.630
Do i? That's what my phone plays
whenever ray lewis calls me.

09:52.640 --> 09:57.130
Well, you are going to record a rollicking
new southern rock theme for nbc sports.

09:57.150 --> 09:58.940
Yee haw!

09:58.970 --> 10:00.510
What sports does nbc have these days?

10:00.540 --> 10:03.960
Off-season tennis. Liz, i'm
going to need jenna all day today.

10:03.970 --> 10:07.610
No. Wednesday is a very
important rehearsal day.

10:09.190 --> 10:11.480
- Where's kenneth?
- Picketing the building.

10:11.490 --> 10:14.590
Whatever religious undergarment
kenneth wears is in a twist

10:14.600 --> 10:16.430
'cause i took my bonus this year.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.290
They lost their overtime
and you took a bonus?

10:19.320 --> 10:21.790
Is someone going to answer these phones?

10:22.830 --> 10:24.650
Studio 6h.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.910
- Hello?
- Hello?

10:26.920 --> 10:29.880
Why don't you give them some
overtime out of your giant bonus?

10:29.910 --> 10:31.940
Aren't you trying to be
johnny america right now?

10:31.970 --> 10:36.000
I am johnny america and
this strike ends now.

10:37.130 --> 10:39.400
Hello? Is anyone there?

10:39.410 --> 10:43.310
I'm in sort of a tunnel and i
see a man with a blue uniform.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.410
I think he's a friend.

10:45.430 --> 10:49.090
Oh, never mind. There's a door. I'm out.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.350
Oh, it's sunny!

10:53.520 --> 10:55.640
Hello, fellow human being.

10:55.650 --> 10:57.780
Would you like to ask
me what time it is?

10:58.520 --> 11:00.900
Are you a large child or a small adult?

11:00.910 --> 11:03.750
You look regular. Can i get your name?

11:04.350 --> 11:07.720
Is it pedro? Is it
craigford? Is it swimming?

11:07.730 --> 11:10.110
Are you a pre-op
trans-centaur?

11:11.710 --> 11:14.780
Excuse me, do you have
change for a $10,000 bill?

11:14.800 --> 11:19.280
I would like some chicken nuggets, a
beer, and some of my wife's rice to stay.

11:19.290 --> 11:22.990
Excuse me, sir. Do you want to
hold hands with a black millionaire?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.590
Does anyone want to be my friend?

11:27.260 --> 11:29.810
I'm normal!

11:30.640 --> 11:35.300
Len, this page strike is an
embarrassment to the company.

11:35.310 --> 11:37.930
I get it.It's like i tell my assistant,

11:37.940 --> 11:40.380
"your weight is a reflection on me."

11:40.390 --> 11:45.130
I can't have that apple-cheeked goon
outside screaming about my bonus.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.590
What are my options?

11:46.610 --> 11:48.760
Let me ask you a question, mr. Donaghy.

11:48.770 --> 11:50.690
How do you kill a snake?

11:50.700 --> 11:54.370
- Cut off the head.
- Of course! Thank you.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.550
Now i won't be afraid
to go into my garage.

11:57.930 --> 12:00.160
All right, here's how
we play this page thing.

12:00.190 --> 12:04.620
I go undercover, infiltrate the union,
take this parcell guy down from the inside.

12:04.630 --> 12:07.690
Very well. And you have
undercover experience?

12:07.700 --> 12:09.940
They used to call me "the chameleon."

12:10.480 --> 12:13.620
Because of my slender
frame and my big wet eyes.

12:16.860 --> 12:19.070
Has anybody seen my wallet?

12:19.080 --> 12:22.800
It's an l.l. Bean child's
wallet from the 1970s.

12:23.140 --> 12:27.280
There's no money in it, but i was one
hole-punch away from a free tasty d-lite.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.170
Damn it to hell! I hate my life!

12:29.180 --> 12:33.790
Liz, maybe you left your wallet
in a friend's car last night.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.110
Maybe.

12:35.130 --> 12:40.380
And maybe i will run into that friend again
tonight and then i will get it back from her.

12:40.410 --> 12:47.040
Yes, she will give it back to you when
he goes home and gets it from her wife.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.630
What's up with you two? You've
been acting weird all week.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.000
- Weird?
- You left together last night.

12:54.010 --> 12:56.700
And then later, i saw you
in front of a comedy club.

12:56.710 --> 12:58.020
- Oh, boy.
- Uterus, oh.

12:58.030 --> 13:00.080
Are you guys doing it?

13:02.420 --> 13:05.880
Yes. Yes. We are doing it.

13:06.390 --> 13:07.510
That's disgusting.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.520
So there you go. Case closed.

13:09.530 --> 13:12.410
Pete and i are intercoursing each other.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.050
Hi, honey.

13:16.060 --> 13:21.910
Liz, i found your wallet in what
our children call, "big wed cawr."

13:21.920 --> 13:24.250
- No, paula. No.
- Let me get through this.

13:27.910 --> 13:30.690
If this is what pete needs...

13:31.220 --> 13:34.620
I would be willing to welcome
you into our lovemaking.

13:34.630 --> 13:35.530
No.
It's--no.

13:35.540 --> 13:39.190
Pete, i know that i haven't been
very sexual since my mother died.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.400
No! Stop! Paula, stop!
Okay, now look.We--

13:42.890 --> 13:48.150
pete and i have been sneaking around because
jack is making us look for a new cast member.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.230
- No!
- I hate that!

13:49.240 --> 13:50.740
Lutz want to smash!

13:50.770 --> 13:53.880
Yeah, but you can't
tell any of the actors.

13:54.780 --> 13:56.400
Do you not see me?

13:56.430 --> 13:59.000
Oh, dang it. I keep
forgetting about you.

13:59.010 --> 14:02.390
You know what? I've
had it with this place.

14:02.400 --> 14:07.690
I don't need this show because i could
get a job tomorrow in the air force.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.170
I quit!

14:11.710 --> 14:14.370
Oh, somebody help him
out, for god's sake.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.570
You got to use your lower back.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.920
That's incorrect. Lift with your legs.

14:19.750 --> 14:23.580
Attention! Attention,
everyone! Strike update!

14:23.590 --> 14:28.980
I am happy to report that
local 415 has joined our cause!

14:28.990 --> 14:30.620
I think we should just give up.

14:30.650 --> 14:32.510
"yeah, brandon's right."

14:32.540 --> 14:38.040
They are a blanket union that includes mall
santas, horse whisperers, and bucket drummers.

14:38.060 --> 14:42.500
Hey, dudes, i'm organizing a viral
protest on tweeter and youtubes.

14:42.520 --> 14:46.260
Anyone wants to get in on that, just
write down your social security numbers.

14:46.270 --> 14:50.110
I'm sorry, brandon, what show
are you assigned to again?

14:50.730 --> 14:52.780
Donahue.

14:53.330 --> 14:56.850
Hey, tray. How's the connecting
to the common man going?

14:56.860 --> 14:59.800
It's going super great, dotcom.

14:59.830 --> 15:04.830
Meet my new friends, nobody and his
wife susan walters-hyphen-nobody.

15:04.860 --> 15:08.420
I'm so far from my roots, i
don't think i'll ever get back.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.840
What's that sound?

15:15.130 --> 15:17.330
Bucket drummers!

15:18.970 --> 15:21.410
Once i'm vested, i'm out of here.

15:22.790 --> 15:23.920
Who are we?

15:23.930 --> 15:26.500
- Pages.
- Mall santas.

15:26.510 --> 15:27.830
And what do we want?

15:27.840 --> 15:30.540
- Overtime.
- Cleaner beards.

15:30.550 --> 15:33.600
- Who are we?
- These! These are my people.

15:33.610 --> 15:36.320
Bucket drummers, if
you're striking, so am i.

15:36.690 --> 15:41.020
2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12, 14, 16, 18--

15:41.030 --> 15:43.690
?It's tennis night in america ?

15:43.710 --> 15:46.650
?Grab some buds and some brews
? ?It's gonna be a fight ?

15:46.660 --> 15:50.630
Okay, i have to tell her that josh quit without
her getting wind of the "new cast member" part.

15:50.640 --> 15:53.170
Well, do it now while
she's drunk on attention.

15:53.180 --> 15:55.160
Or in an hour when she's just drunk.

15:55.170 --> 15:57.630
Cut! Good. Let's take five.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.350
You look pretty.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.810
Did you hear what
happened? I am so upset.

16:01.820 --> 16:03.410
Oh, no. Okay, let me explain.

16:03.420 --> 16:07.030
I came in here to shoot these tennis
promos and they had blue gels on the lights.

16:07.060 --> 16:09.240
You know that makes my
teeth look see-through.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.360
You weren't here to do your job, liz.

16:11.380 --> 16:14.190
- Okay, well, josh quit.
- Who?

16:14.200 --> 16:17.030
Jack's counting on country
jenna to save the show,

16:17.060 --> 16:19.310
But i just want to understand
what it is that's distracting you

16:19.320 --> 16:20.940
from the one thing
you've been told to do.

16:20.950 --> 16:22.980
Really? You want to know
what i've been doing?

16:22.990 --> 16:25.000
Yes, liz. Enlighten me.

16:25.660 --> 16:27.620
Jack is hiring a new cast member.

16:27.640 --> 16:31.170
If it is a blonde woman,
i will kill myself!

16:32.640 --> 16:34.530
Jenna maroney is great!

16:34.550 --> 16:37.790
- No new cast member!
- New what?

16:37.800 --> 16:40.880
If it's a blonde
woman, i'ma kill myself!

16:41.310 --> 16:42.850
I don't know what to
tell you, mr. Donaghy.

16:42.870 --> 16:46.670
Sympathy strikers,
celebrities, clever signs.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.240
This strike is getting out of control.

16:48.260 --> 16:52.020
Then step up the pressure,
len. Take parcell down.

16:52.030 --> 16:55.000
I can't. The man is incorruptible.

16:55.230 --> 17:00.510
He was impervious to the charms
of the nympho coed charlene larue.

17:03.920 --> 17:09.060
Guide me. Tell me what to do... Nixon.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

17:18.510 --> 17:20.050
May i come in, kenneth?

17:20.060 --> 17:21.890
Of course, sir.

17:24.050 --> 17:25.960
Would you like something to eat?

17:25.970 --> 17:28.860
I have some leftover
turtle meat from dinner.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.080
Or as you would call
it, "bonus" turtle meat.

17:32.090 --> 17:34.850
I'll just make myself a drink, if
you don't mind. Where's the bar?

17:34.860 --> 17:39.140
Well, there's a bar in the shower that the
previous tenant installed to keep from slipping.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.900
He still died in there though.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.340
We're not so different... You and i.

17:47.350 --> 17:49.370
Those glasses are for display only.

17:49.390 --> 17:51.400
We both grew up poor.

17:51.940 --> 17:55.530
We both put work above all else.

17:57.180 --> 18:01.010
And yet when people look at you,
they see who they want to be.

18:01.570 --> 18:04.290
When they look at me,
they see who they are.

18:04.760 --> 18:08.470
Sir, you sound like the mall santas
when they come back from lunch.

18:09.410 --> 18:11.660
You win, kenneth.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.490
You have the moral high
ground. I can't change that.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.250
But i can destroy you.

18:19.260 --> 18:23.810
If the pages are not back at work tomorrow
morning, i am shutting down the page program...

18:24.590 --> 18:27.110
- Forever.
- You wouldn't.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.960
Okay, josh refuses to un-quit.
Jenna and tracy are on strike.

18:35.970 --> 18:38.580
We have no actors. Now we
could rerun episode 214.

18:38.590 --> 18:41.330
No, no, no. That's the one where
tracy tore up that picture of the pope.

18:41.340 --> 18:45.470
In his defense, it was pope innocent the fourth
because he increased taxation in the papal states.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.680
Well, where are your solutions, liz lemon?
You know, this whole thing is your fault.

18:48.690 --> 18:52.030
It's not my fault.Blame jack
or kenneth or tracy or meat cat,

18:52.040 --> 18:54.440
'cause i've had the cheesy
blasters for three days.

18:54.450 --> 18:56.780
We have no show, liz. You better
hope that strike ends soon.

18:56.790 --> 18:59.260
Why, so they can all go back
to making my life a living hell?

18:59.270 --> 19:01.360
I hope they stay on strike forever!

19:01.840 --> 19:04.430
Is this really our first week back?

19:05.300 --> 19:07.780
Whenever would be convenient for you.

19:07.790 --> 19:10.280
- Who are we?
- Pages.

19:10.290 --> 19:11.590
And what do we want?

19:11.620 --> 19:13.740
What are you still doing here,
kenneth? I made myself clear.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.380
Well, sir, now that
i know you're a liar,

19:16.400 --> 19:19.480
I was wondering if you were lying
about canceling the page program.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.820
And then i thought if
there were no pages,

19:21.860 --> 19:26.260
You'd have to pay somebody real money to
do our jobs and give them health insurance.

19:26.270 --> 19:28.960
And if you don't even have
money to pay our overtime,

19:28.980 --> 19:31.510
Then you certainly
can't afford all that.

19:33.690 --> 19:35.380
What do you want?

19:35.420 --> 19:37.780
You know what i want, sir.

19:43.300 --> 19:48.810
"i am a big ol' liar."

19:53.080 --> 19:56.070
The strike is over!

19:56.820 --> 19:57.760
What did we get?

19:57.790 --> 20:01.300
A piece of paper that i
can't really tell you about!

20:01.310 --> 20:06.430
Wait. Was this strike just over a
personal thing between you and mr. Donaghy?

20:09.530 --> 20:11.590
Massage it, kenneth.

20:12.720 --> 20:15.450
No, it wasn't!

20:46.480 --> 20:49.370

I hate that i kinda like that

20:57.060 --> 21:03.160

There's nothing wrong with being fun and popular
and just giving people what they want
