<i>Previously on "The Real</i> <i>
Housewives of New Jersey"...</i>

00:03.829 --> 00:04.917
I'm gonna invite everyone

00:04.961 --> 00:06.093
to come down
to our shore house.

00:06.136 --> 00:07.311
We're gonna open up Missy G's.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.791
Audriana? She had dance.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.010
Okay.

00:10.053 --> 00:10.880
I'm going to Boston
for a week.

00:10.923 --> 00:11.968
She has nationals.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.665
This is unfinished.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.058
The molding is not done.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.364
I cannot wait
till the house is done.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.192
Well, I got news for you.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.845
Dad's coming home.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.195
<i>â™ª</i>

00:21.238 --> 00:23.240
I'm looking to move
back into Dolores' house.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.198
Dolores sends out
a group text message.

00:24.241 --> 00:25.373
"Family meeting."

00:25.416 --> 00:26.635
You know
they're gonna kill you.

00:26.678 --> 00:27.810
"What the [BLEEP]?
Why isn't the house done?

00:27.853 --> 00:29.029
Etcetera.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.073
I'm so scared
of gaining weight,

00:30.117 --> 00:31.553
and I'm hungry all the time.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.381
That's why I think you
should see somebody, sweetie.

00:33.424 --> 00:37.515
I'm afraid that I'm gonna
relapse and kill myself.

00:37.559 --> 00:40.344
In this video,
Louie is on the beach

00:40.388 --> 00:42.433
<i>in the middle</i> <i>
of this pack of men.</i>

00:42.477 --> 00:43.608
<i>Louie should just</i> <i>
address the video.</i>

00:43.652 --> 00:45.349
You can't have
all this sh-- out there

00:45.393 --> 00:46.437
and expect no one to talk
about it; I'm sorry.

00:46.481 --> 00:47.656
You always say,
"Bill's the best."

00:47.699 --> 00:49.049
He had an affair.
- You're jealous.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.354
Everybody knows.

00:50.398 --> 00:51.703
Don't cry because
there's no reason to.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.879
You think I'm ----ing weak
for crying?

00:53.923 --> 00:55.316
I'm not weak for crying.

00:55.359 --> 00:56.708
Let me tell you something, Jennifer.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.188
I don't think Dolores

00:58.232 --> 01:00.843
is just being the kind
of friend you need right now.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.498
- Do I support you or no?
- I would love more.

01:03.541 --> 01:04.977
Fine, then I'll work on that.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.718
But I don't need
to hear from this.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.068
Don't ----ing call me--

01:08.111 --> 01:08.981
What are you
gonna do about it?

01:09.025 --> 01:10.548
Frank.

01:10.592 --> 01:11.767
Really, what the
are you gonna do about it?

01:11.810 --> 01:12.985
Frank.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.291
Don't ----ing talk
in my face.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.337
Don't talk in my ----ing face.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.252
What are you--
what is going on here?

01:18.295 --> 01:19.731
<i>What is going on here?</i> <i>
- No, I don't want--</i>

01:19.775 --> 01:21.733
- Don't ----ing--
- All right, no, all right.

01:21.777 --> 01:24.214
Don't ----ing talk
in my ----ing face.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.520
What is going on here?

01:25.563 --> 01:27.261
- What's happening?
- What's the matter?

01:27.304 --> 01:28.871
She gets on my nerves.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.307
I've known Dolores
since she was 19 years old.

01:30.351 --> 01:32.092
<i>Dolores grew up</i> <i>
on the streets of Paterson.</i>

01:32.135 --> 01:33.180
<i>She's a street fighter.</i>

01:33.223 --> 01:35.182
<i>She got in a fight in a bar,</i>

01:35.225 --> 01:36.618
she bit through the girl--
two of her nails.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.228
- She's heated.
- Yeah.

01:38.272 --> 01:39.838
When Dolores
goes into a rage,

01:39.882 --> 01:42.058
you need to separate her.
- Hey, sweetie.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.755
Dolores referred to me
as "this."

01:43.799 --> 01:45.757
She doesn't know
who she's dealing with.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.411
Or she'll do something
that she's gonna regret.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.239
- I'm good.
- Yeah, all right.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.936
If you think
I'm not your friend,

01:50.980 --> 01:53.504
if you think I should support
you more, you don't tell her.

01:53.548 --> 01:54.679
I was just being honest.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.290
I didn't think it was
gonna start--

01:56.333 --> 01:57.421
You're not that
close with her.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.510
We're starting,
we're starting.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.904
But then she wants
to pick apart your friendship.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.340
I'm not picking apart
your friendships.

02:03.384 --> 02:06.082
I'm telling her
so she doesn't rely on somebody

02:06.126 --> 02:07.649
who's not gonna follow through.

02:07.692 --> 02:10.608
Dolores wants to come for me
because I'm the first one

02:10.652 --> 02:12.523
with balls to call her out
on her bullsh--.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.612
I've done more
for my friends

02:14.656 --> 02:17.049
than you would ever do
in a million years.

02:17.093 --> 02:18.790
You have no idea what I do.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.663
And not only am I
zero percent scared of her,

02:21.706 --> 02:23.882
I'm also not going to pretend
she's a good friend

02:23.926 --> 02:25.188
to Jennifer when she's not.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.059
I can be friends
with both of them,

02:27.103 --> 02:28.670
and I don't have to take sides.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.802
I'm going through
an emotional ringer right now.

02:30.846 --> 02:34.632
David and I aren't together.
I'm very hurt.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.330
<i>Everybody should go</i> <i>
themselves</i>

02:36.373 --> 02:37.809
because I know who I am,
and I know

02:37.853 --> 02:41.161
how I've backed every one
of these mother----ers.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.640
They can work it out themselves.

02:42.684 --> 02:45.339
Last time, Jennifer
didn't want to talk about it.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.776
All right.
We can talk about it.

02:47.819 --> 02:50.126
Okay, fine,
then we'll let them talk.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.867
So then let's talk,
me and you.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.869
Okay.

02:53.912 --> 02:55.740
I don't want
to have issues with you,

02:55.784 --> 02:57.264
but you've had
a double standard

02:57.307 --> 02:59.091
about that I had an affair.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.484
You've crucified me for it.

03:00.528 --> 03:01.833
- It's not the same.
- It's the judging--

03:01.877 --> 03:04.009
It is the same.
Your husband was like me.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.838
And then you called me slutty
for the same behavior.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.058
That's what it was.

03:09.101 --> 03:10.494
Okay. That's fair.

03:10.538 --> 03:13.193
I went in on you
a little bit too much

03:13.236 --> 03:14.672
with your relationships.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.284
<i>I'm just starting to realize</i> <i>
now that the way</i>

03:17.327 --> 03:20.591
that she's been boasting
about her affair

03:20.635 --> 03:22.245
was a real trigger for me.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.986
I was quick to judge.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.640
<i>I think, you know,</i> <i>
what if this girl</i>

03:25.683 --> 03:27.685
that Bill cheated on me with
was going around

03:27.729 --> 03:30.862
bragging about her affair
with my husband?

03:30.906 --> 03:35.345
I mean, if I ever heard that,
it's so heart-wrenching.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.694
But I still gotta tell you, like,

03:36.738 --> 03:39.871
I still feel so hurt
by what you did.

03:39.915 --> 03:42.091
Listen, my only motivation
in all of this

03:42.134 --> 03:44.267
was to make sure she's
surrounded by people who--

03:44.311 --> 03:45.747
You questioning
my friendship to her...

03:45.790 --> 03:46.661
Yeah, I did.

03:46.704 --> 03:47.705
And she did too.
- Was wrong.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.577
If I thought
she was really that bad,

03:49.620 --> 03:50.926
I've been there for friends--
I'll call and say,

03:50.969 --> 03:53.711
"Do you need me?"
But this, I think she's okay.

03:53.755 --> 03:56.018
Dolores just brushes off
everybody's feelings.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.063
I'm tired of this
whole thing with Jackie.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.282
Get over it.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.718
I don't want
to hear it anymore.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.372
When I was going through
all the infidelity rumors

04:02.416 --> 04:04.722
last year, I was not okay.

04:04.766 --> 04:07.899
It put me in a really dangerous
path with my eating disorder.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.205
- Are with happy with--
- I don't think she's okay

04:09.249 --> 04:10.380
if she leaves crying.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.077
And a real friend
doesn't just assume

04:12.121 --> 04:14.558
that you're gonna get
through it and you're fine.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.691
Not everybody does things
the same, Jackie.

04:16.734 --> 04:19.084
But I'll be there for her
if she needs me.

04:19.128 --> 04:22.305
Listen, you ambushed me
to intentionally hurt me.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.741
I didn't ambush you.
I didn't--

04:23.785 --> 04:25.047
It's how I felt.
It's how I feel.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.353
But you knew about it.

04:26.396 --> 04:27.919
Do you understand why
I kept it a secret?

04:27.963 --> 04:30.487
You must understand.
It was for him.

04:30.531 --> 04:31.575
- From what?
- My kids are still little.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.011
They look up to their father.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.100
I'm part of the Syrian
Orthodox community.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.450
They want--no, Bill.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.408
I don't want him
to be humiliated.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.931
He's not gonna be humiliated.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.411
You know, it's always
about, like, protecting him.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.544
My family's name, my in-laws.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.110
Like, they're gonna blame me
for everything.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.764
What are they gonna say?
What are they gonna say?

04:46.808 --> 04:49.332
I wouldn't be surprised if
they thought I was a bad wife,

04:49.376 --> 04:51.378
<i>that I wasn't sleeping</i> <i>
with him enough.</i>

04:51.421 --> 04:53.684
You're putting on this front
trying to cover up everything.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.165
You don't have to ----ing
hit it home how great he is.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.298
But that makes me happy
to say how great he is.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.429
Of course.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.996
Do I want another
infidelity?

05:01.039 --> 05:02.650
Or I gotta keep gassing my
husband--you know what I mean?

05:02.693 --> 05:04.260
No, you don't have to.
That's not why he--

05:04.304 --> 05:05.827
- Like, we make it work now.
- That's not why it happened.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.612
You do a great job.
That's not why it happened.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.484
This girl and I
are further apart

05:10.527 --> 05:12.181
than I even realized.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.139
You had nothing to ----ing do
with it, believe me.

05:14.183 --> 05:17.099
She's brainwashed to think
that all women are blamed

05:17.142 --> 05:18.492
for men's poor behavior,

05:18.535 --> 05:20.755
not just the other woman,
but the wife too.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.496
It's actually very, very sad.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.846
I just don't want to hurt him.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.501
You're not hurting him.
You're the one that's hurt.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.111
I want them to work it out.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.156
Then they have to figure it
out between the two of them.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.028
- What am I gonna say?
- Hi. Are you guys good?

05:33.071 --> 05:34.072
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:34.116 --> 05:36.074
We know how to talk
like adults.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.293
All right, so are you

05:37.337 --> 05:38.599
gonna be down
the shore this week?

05:38.642 --> 05:39.600
- Yeah.
- Okay, 'cause I'm gonna

05:39.643 --> 05:41.166
go down, and, like,

05:41.210 --> 05:42.124
I think we should, like,
hang out.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.343
Yeah. Definitely.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.256
You know, Teresa rented
a shore house.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.475
She's in Lavallette.

05:45.519 --> 05:46.737
Yeah, and if you'd
like to come down--

05:46.781 --> 05:47.869
Why?

05:47.912 --> 05:49.261
Why don't you sleep over
one night?

05:49.305 --> 05:50.698
I feel like I want to throw
a little pink party,

05:50.741 --> 05:52.308
opposed to a white party.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.050
- I would love...
- Come on, let's go.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.356
Let's go.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.403
- Look at them.
- Frank is doing a keg stand.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.187
Oh, I would love
to see that.

06:02.231 --> 06:03.188
Oh!

06:03.232 --> 06:05.060
Oh, oh!

06:05.103 --> 06:07.802
Jennifer, I do not want
to hurt you.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.238
Ahh!

06:09.281 --> 06:11.936
Oh, sh--!

06:11.980 --> 06:13.373
- Ooh!
- Oh!

06:13.416 --> 06:14.417
I don't want to see you
crying and leaving events.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.766
Same.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.855
I would like to move
past it, okay?

06:17.899 --> 06:19.683
All right. Listen.
We're gonna put this to bed.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.076
All our dirty laundry's
out there.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.425
It's done, it's over.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.514
We don't talk
about infidelities.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.907
Hi. We're much better.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.256
- Yeah?
- We're much better.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.692
- Good. Oh, I'm happy.
- We're baby steps, yeah.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.738
Well, 'cause Melissa
was talking about

06:30.781 --> 06:32.740
everybody coming down
to the shore next weekend.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.045
I know you have a house.
- She got a house.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.438
Yeah, I do. Yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.570
Yeah,
we have to have a good time.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.398
Traci's doing it.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.573
Oh, the hair went back,
it's real.

06:39.616 --> 06:40.878
Don't spill it.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.227
- I'm so ready--
- She's having a better time.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.446
Go!

06:43.490 --> 06:46.406
- One, two!
- Are you guys good?

06:46.449 --> 06:47.537
You're okay?
- I don't know.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.365
We're going
in the right direction.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.627
- Ah!
- Seven!

06:50.671 --> 06:53.108
Baby steps, right?
Baby steps.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.371
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

06:55.415 --> 06:58.766
You want to continue
this party at my shore house.

06:58.809 --> 07:01.986
I'm gonna get a ----ing keg.

07:02.030 --> 07:05.076
There's no better idea
than a keg.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.556
<i>Coming up...</i>

07:06.600 --> 07:08.558
I'm not allowed to take
a woman home, to the house?

07:08.602 --> 07:10.386
- Nope.
- Oh, my God.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.561
Your girlfriend
doesn't stay over?

07:11.605 --> 07:13.041
Your boyfriend
doesn't stay over?

07:13.084 --> 07:14.434
- That was different.
- What are you trying to say?

07:14.477 --> 07:15.783
That your boyfriend

07:15.826 --> 07:17.567
don't have sex
when we're in the house?

07:17.611 --> 07:19.439
- Frank!
- This is disgusting.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.570
All right.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.883
Dog, wanna match today? Yo.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.493
You're getting
as fat as me.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.016
Let me see.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.279
It's your new harness.
Do you love it?

07:35.759 --> 07:37.152
<i>â™ª</i>

07:37.195 --> 07:40.198
Hi, honey, how's Boston?

07:40.242 --> 07:42.200
<i>Boston's great.</i>

07:45.813 --> 07:49.904
It's choppy.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.166
I can't hear you.

07:51.209 --> 07:54.430
<i>â™ª</i>

07:55.562 --> 07:57.825
- He hates you.
- No, he loves me.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.783
- He's gonna growl at you.
- You think he likes you?

07:59.827 --> 08:01.176
You're so annoying.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.569
<i>I know you love me,</i> <i>
I'm your mother.</i>

08:02.612 --> 08:04.440
<i>Stop.</i>

08:04.484 --> 08:11.534
<i>â™ª</i>

08:12.013 --> 08:14.537
Hi, I have a 2:00 consult.

08:14.581 --> 08:15.930
Someone will be right out
with you.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.409
You can just have a seat.

08:17.453 --> 08:18.933
- Hi, Jackie?
- Hi.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.021
Hi, I'm Kristen.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.588
Come on back.
- Okay.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.241
Right down at the end
of the hallway.

08:23.285 --> 08:24.765
Just grab a seat on the couch.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.158
Okay, great, thank you.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.551
All right,
the first thing we'll talk

08:28.595 --> 08:30.901
a lot about
is your medical history

08:30.945 --> 08:32.512
and your eating patterns
in detail.

08:32.555 --> 08:33.991
- Okay.
- And I definitely

08:34.035 --> 08:35.515
encourage you
to be open and honest.

08:35.558 --> 08:38.256
That way, we can really
figure out next steps for you.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.519
- Sounds good.
- Sounds okay?

08:39.562 --> 08:40.824
Yeah.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.131
So, first, how did you
initially hear about us?

08:43.174 --> 08:44.480
I've always known
about Renfrew.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.656
I've been struggling
with an eating disorder

08:46.700 --> 08:48.179
for 20 years, so...

08:48.223 --> 08:52.357
Renfrew is the preeminent
treatment center

08:52.401 --> 08:55.143
for people suffering
from eating disorders.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.145
Was there anything
in particular

08:57.188 --> 08:58.538
that caused you
to want to reach out?

08:58.581 --> 09:00.496
My kids
are getting older and...

09:00.540 --> 09:02.672
apparently noticing
certain things.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.456
What did they say to you?

09:04.500 --> 09:05.414
They said,
"Why is Mom eating

09:05.457 --> 09:07.024
the same dinner every night?"

09:07.068 --> 09:08.373
I know at some point

09:08.417 --> 09:11.333
I have to stop what I'm doing
and get started.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.987
If you wouldn't mind
letting me know

09:13.030 --> 09:15.293
when in your life you started
to make intentional changes

09:15.337 --> 09:16.860
around what you were
eating every day.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.993
Okay. I've always been
concerned about my body image.

09:19.036 --> 09:21.822
<i>As a senior in high school,</i> <i>
I went on Weight Watchers.</i>

09:21.865 --> 09:24.651
<i>And then I went to college,</i> <i>
and I really wanted to be thin</i>

09:24.694 --> 09:26.174
<i>so I was cutting</i> <i>
more and more.</i>

09:26.217 --> 09:28.437
And I just got to a place
where I just had

09:28.480 --> 09:30.352
cut everything out of my diet.

09:30.395 --> 09:31.745
<i>When I was in high school,</i>

09:31.788 --> 09:35.009
I remember a guy once saying
that he loves a girl

09:35.052 --> 09:36.750
that he can pick up
with his pinkie.

09:36.793 --> 09:39.883
Those were the girls that
everyone wanted to be around.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.537
Do you feel like
you're currently

09:41.581 --> 09:43.365
kind of counting
your calories in any way?

09:43.408 --> 09:44.932
I'm always counting my
calories, every single calorie.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.674
<i>When I finally got there</i> <i>
and people were paying me</i>

09:47.717 --> 09:51.025
so much attention,
I just never wanted to leave.

09:51.068 --> 09:54.506
I give myself
two to three meals a week

09:54.550 --> 09:57.161
that are foods
that are different.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.120
The rest of my meals are salad.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.382
Lots of lettuce.
- Lettuce.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.384
Yeah. So I worry about

10:02.427 --> 10:04.038
I'm not getting any nutrients
from my food.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.517
All right. Right now,

10:05.561 --> 10:07.302
I want to talk about current
medical symptoms

10:07.345 --> 10:08.520
you might be experiencing.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.522
Any, like, numbness
or tingling?

10:10.566 --> 10:12.699
Yeah, sometimes
my fingertips go numb.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.309
- Okay.
- Yeah.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.485
And do you ever feel like
you're cold a lot of the time?

10:16.528 --> 10:17.965
Yes, I'm always cold.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.532
And do you ever notice
lightheadedness or dizziness?

10:20.576 --> 10:23.100
I have a really
slow heart rate.

10:23.144 --> 10:26.408
If I get up too quickly,
I'm always dizzy.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.498
- Okay.
- This definitely sounds

10:29.541 --> 10:31.500
like the kind of stuff
you can help with, right?

10:31.543 --> 10:35.025
Yes, but I think in order
to really be able to solidify

10:35.069 --> 10:36.723
what we'd want
to offer you next steps,

10:36.766 --> 10:40.074
we'd want you to see
your doctor too and, you know,

10:40.117 --> 10:41.423
have routine labs.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.251
There's an EKG
included in that,

10:43.294 --> 10:44.905
because your heart rate's
a little bit lower.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.384
Okay.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.908
I can't start treatment
until all that gets done?

10:47.951 --> 10:49.605
Yes.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.129
We'd want to make sure
your body is okay,

10:52.173 --> 10:53.870
and you definitely flagged,
you know,

10:53.914 --> 10:55.785
feeling that you're not eating
foods that are nutrient dense.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.701
So as you start to increase
your food intake,

10:58.745 --> 11:00.616
your circulation
actually increases.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.923
So that can cause your heart
or your other organs

11:02.966 --> 11:04.272
to get overwhelmed.
- Oh.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.969
So we've seen people
experience heart attacks

11:06.013 --> 11:07.231
or cardiac issues.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.842
Do you think
I'm at risk for that?

11:08.885 --> 11:10.626
You could be.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.629
We can't rule it out
until we get your medical.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.110
Okay, I'll do whatever
I have to do.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.373
Now I'm scared.

11:18.416 --> 11:24.161
<i>â™ª</i>

11:24.205 --> 11:25.293
Hi.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.511
- Welcome.
- How are you?

11:26.555 --> 11:27.774
I have reservations
for Catania.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.210
Yes. Is everyone here?

11:29.253 --> 11:31.125
<i>You can sit me,</i> <i>
they'll find me.</i>

11:31.168 --> 11:33.083
- Okay.
- So cute.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.650
<i>â™ª</i>

11:34.694 --> 11:35.738
Thank you.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.609
Of course. Enjoy.

11:37.653 --> 11:38.872
Hey, Mama.

11:38.915 --> 11:41.396
- Oh, hi, little guy.
- How are you? Good?

11:41.439 --> 11:43.180
I don't want
to get makeup on you.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.400
- It's all right.
- Sit next to me?

11:45.443 --> 11:48.533
- This place looks good.
- My little Frankie.

11:48.577 --> 11:49.665
We haven't gotten together
in so long.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.145
I know, we got a lot
to talk about.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.016
Look at this one.
- Family.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.584
- Oh, doctor.
- Frankie.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.499
My brother gets up to see me.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.501
I'm your mother,
you come to see me.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.245
The drinks here
are really good.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.637
Let's get Gabby drunk.

12:05.681 --> 12:06.987
I have to go
to work tomorrow.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.510
I have a feeling that's where

12:08.553 --> 12:09.772
this is gonna be going though.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.731
So here's the thing.
You guys are gonna be

12:11.774 --> 12:13.863
living with your dad full time
for the first time.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.299
We were infants
when we lived together.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.214
Yeah.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.563
And that's why I called
a family meeting.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.870
Like, I want everybody
to get it off your chest.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.698
If anyone has preferences,
it's this one.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.352
I just think we have
to, like, set ground rules

12:24.395 --> 12:25.527
that, like, Frank
can't have guests.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.833
So if Dad
brings girls home...

12:26.876 --> 12:28.573
They can't be coming
around the house.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.837
Frank doesn't realize
it's disrespectful.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.187
<i>You don't want girls</i> <i>
in the house?</i>

12:33.230 --> 12:35.145
<i>There's no girls in the house.</i>

12:35.189 --> 12:36.886
Seriously, guys,
I want it all out tonight

12:36.930 --> 12:38.932
while I'm here
if I need to be a referee.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.804
- Oh, wow, look at this guy.
- Love you.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.546
- Love you.
- What's happening?

12:44.589 --> 12:46.069
Looks like a good--

12:46.113 --> 12:47.984
We're laying down rules
for when you come home.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.333
No hoes.

12:49.377 --> 12:53.729
- No boats, no hoes.
- Oh, my God. Listen.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.864
Check. I just sat down, guys. Seriously.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.039
We're only kidding.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.736
Hello, guys,
welcome to the Craftsman.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.781
Can we get you guys started off
with anything to drink?

13:01.824 --> 13:02.825
Can I have red sangria,
please?

13:02.869 --> 13:03.957
Of course.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.436
I heard you guys
make a incredible,

13:05.480 --> 13:07.395
what's it called, a tequila--
- A tequila mockingbird.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.831
That's it.
Let me have one of those.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.050
- Okay.
- I'll have a water, please.

13:10.093 --> 13:11.225
Of course.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.879
I'll have whatever
he's having.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.881
We're gonna do some food,
what are you guys having?

13:14.924 --> 13:16.273
Lamb chops for my main.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.406
Can I have
the farmer's market platter?

13:18.449 --> 13:19.711
Can I have
a miso glazed salmon?

13:19.755 --> 13:20.843
Shrimp scampi. Thank you.

13:20.887 --> 13:21.975
No problem,
we'll be right back.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.019
Thank you.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.891
So my concern is that

13:24.934 --> 13:26.675
I don't want any trouble
under this roof.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.416
I know you guys
have concerns.

13:28.459 --> 13:31.985
I know my lifestyle
is not exactly conducive

13:32.028 --> 13:33.769
to a normal family,

13:33.813 --> 13:35.423
but I'm still
the ----ing father.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.772
But it's about
being respectful

13:36.816 --> 13:38.165
when there's other people
in the house.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.470
So what are you
trying to say?

13:39.514 --> 13:40.732
You know exactly
what I'm trying to say.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.517
No, I don't.
I'm not allowed to take

13:42.560 --> 13:44.432
a woman home to the house
and have sex with her?

13:44.475 --> 13:46.173
- Nope.
- Oh, my God.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.871
- No sleepovers.
- Why?

13:48.915 --> 13:50.351
Your girlfriend
doesn't stay over?

13:50.394 --> 13:52.005
Your boyfriend
doesn't stay over?

13:52.048 --> 13:53.354
- That was different.
- What are you trying to say?

13:53.397 --> 13:54.790
That your boyfriend
don't have sex

13:54.834 --> 13:56.705
when we're in the house?
- No--

13:56.748 --> 13:58.794
Frank, I don't talk like that.
We don't talk like that.

13:58.838 --> 13:59.969
No, no, no--

14:00.013 --> 14:00.752
We don't talk like that
with our kids.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.015
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.277
Nothing is loud enough

14:03.320 --> 14:04.626
that you can hear
three floors down.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.367
Like when your friend
from Texas came.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.672
Quite honestly,
maybe your boyfriend

14:07.716 --> 14:10.632
doesn't satisfy you
like I satisfy my--

14:10.675 --> 14:13.113
Okay.
- Stop it!

14:13.156 --> 14:14.723
This is disgusting.

14:14.766 --> 14:15.898
This is coming from the guy

14:15.942 --> 14:17.204
with the ----ing ball gag
in his room.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.467
- It was a joke.
- It was a joke?

14:19.510 --> 14:21.295
The teeth marks
in it were too.

14:21.338 --> 14:22.731
Yeah, it was a joke.

14:22.774 --> 14:23.819
And I'm gonna pop this
right in front of you.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.864
Thank you.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.604
- No problem.
- That looks good.

14:26.648 --> 14:27.823
Guys, listen to me,
my family

14:27.867 --> 14:29.216
is the most important
thing to me

14:29.259 --> 14:30.826
and I promise you guys

14:30.870 --> 14:33.829
I will not let my life take
priority over their lives.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.484
- That's good.
- You really never told us

14:36.527 --> 14:38.225
exactly why you're
on your way home again.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.314
Well, honestly, ever since
you started the renovations,

14:40.357 --> 14:41.706
I'm like a gypsy.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.230
If anybody asks where
my home is right now,

14:43.273 --> 14:45.188
what would I say?
My shore house?

14:45.232 --> 14:47.321
- No, that's fair.
- And also, I'm getting older.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.757
The things that matter
are my family.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.802
It is a temporary place
to live.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.501
Obviously, it's not going
to be my last homestead,

14:53.544 --> 14:55.633
but Dolores and I got divorced

14:55.677 --> 14:57.113
<i>when she was pregnant</i> <i>
with Frankie.</i>

14:57.157 --> 14:58.985
So it's a great opportunity

14:59.028 --> 15:00.943
<i>'cause I've never lived</i> <i>
with both of my kids</i>

15:00.987 --> 15:02.684
at the same time
in the same house.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.512
I'm very thankful to be
living with you guys.

15:04.555 --> 15:07.689
100 percent.
When are you coming back?

15:07.732 --> 15:11.475
I'm not coming anytime soon.
I may extend my lease.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.695
- Oh, why?
- I mean, I like where I live.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.088
I just want to be
alone and chill and--

15:15.131 --> 15:17.699
What's going on
between you and David?

15:17.742 --> 15:24.445
So, you know, we kind
of grew apart a little bit.

15:24.488 --> 15:27.709
A lot. I don't see him much.
He's been asking to see me,

15:27.752 --> 15:30.407
but spending the time
that I have alone,

15:30.451 --> 15:31.669
I wonder what I want
in a relationship.

15:31.713 --> 15:32.888
Cut to the point.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.456
Just tell the kids
what the deal is.

15:35.499 --> 15:36.892
Okay? Tell them.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.589
Unfortunately,
this is the end of the road

15:38.633 --> 15:41.810
for me and David.
- Oh, my gosh.

15:41.853 --> 15:44.552
This is terrible to hear about.

15:44.595 --> 15:47.120
But why?

15:47.163 --> 15:49.905
It's because the lack
of communication.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.560
I feel that he hasn't been
there for me in a lot of ways.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.518
He didn't meet me halfway
on a lot of things.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.085
He didn't even meet me
a little bit.

15:56.129 --> 16:00.220
It's the hardest thing to do
is to part ways with someone

16:00.263 --> 16:04.050
that you still love
and care about very much.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.095
But I had nowhere else
to go with this.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.096
That's understandable.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.011
You did your best
to compromise.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.404
It's very sad.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.188
I loved you and David
as a couple.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.625
Frankie, do you think
that your mom and David

16:14.669 --> 16:17.063
will ever get married?

16:17.106 --> 16:18.412
Honestly, yes.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.414
It's like the way
it ended, it sucks.

16:20.457 --> 16:21.937
I feel really bad about it

16:21.981 --> 16:23.330
because I really like David
as a person.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.635
- I loved him.
- It's very hard.

16:24.679 --> 16:27.508
- I loved David too.
- I feel so bad, Frank.

16:27.551 --> 16:30.163
I know you do.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.512
You know my loyalty is to you.

16:31.555 --> 16:32.817
Right.

16:32.861 --> 16:33.993
And you know your kids'
loyalty is to you.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.777
Do you have a problem
with any of us?

16:35.820 --> 16:37.387
Maintaining
a relationship with him.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.954
It's hard to be there for him

16:38.998 --> 16:41.435
because David has become
very attached to this family.

16:41.478 --> 16:44.960
<i>I never realized how close</i> <i>
the kids would get to David.</i>

16:45.004 --> 16:47.093
Because he wasn't too fond
on getting close with me

16:47.136 --> 16:50.052
sometimes,
you know, as we can all see.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.488
But they're there.

16:51.532 --> 16:52.968
Nothing but very sad.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.275
<i>I brought this man</i> <i>
into their lives.</i>

16:55.318 --> 16:58.104
I'm not taking him out
because we didn't work out.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.236
I feel terrible.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.718
- It's all right, Mom.
- Home is with us.

17:05.502 --> 17:06.503
<i>Coming up...</i>

17:06.547 --> 17:07.896
Oh, yeah.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.115
These people don't know
what they're in for.

17:09.158 --> 17:10.246
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.465
Yeah, I want a little water.

17:11.508 --> 17:12.640
Give her a little water,
she's parched.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.729
This woman.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.349
<i>â™ª</i>

17:26.393 --> 17:28.090
<i>- Joe?</i> <i>
- Yeah?</i>

17:28.134 --> 17:29.613
I'm trying to decide
for the shore.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.789
I think I'm gonna take this
green terrycloth jumpsuit.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.661
I got you a beautiful
matching terrycloth.

17:33.704 --> 17:35.619
I mean, we're like
little matching towels.

17:37.143 --> 17:40.972
<i>â™ª</i>

17:41.016 --> 17:42.278
- Babe?
- Yeah, honey?

17:42.322 --> 17:43.888
- You packing?
- I am.

17:43.932 --> 17:46.326
Look, I have this outfit.
I mean, it's cute,

17:46.369 --> 17:47.414
it's a little big on me,
but whatever.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.372
It'll just make me
look skinnier.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.679
They'll be like, "Oh, my God,
you're losing so much weight!"

17:51.722 --> 17:54.551
I'll be like, "It's the stress
you bitches are causing me."

17:55.987 --> 17:58.381
<i>â™ª</i>

17:58.425 --> 18:00.122
<i>Are you guys happy</i> <i>
to be home from camp?</i>

18:00.166 --> 18:02.429
- Yes!
- Yeah? You had fun?

18:02.472 --> 18:06.302
Oh, I missed you so much.
All right.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.174
Daddy's gonna come stay
with you guys tomorrow

18:08.217 --> 18:09.740
when we're
at the Jersey shore.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.438
But, listen, when do I get
to cut these hairs?

18:11.481 --> 18:14.615
- Never! I like growing it.
- You look like a Chia Pet.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.486
How about this?

18:18.706 --> 18:20.011
You guys are so weird.

18:23.058 --> 18:29.195
<i>â™ª</i>

18:29.238 --> 18:31.022
Oh, my happy place.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.850
I got, like, some snacks,

18:32.894 --> 18:34.678
and I got so much alcohol.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.898
Soon as I get down here,
something happens to me.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.291
You get horny.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.380
I get very horny,
very horny.

18:40.423 --> 18:41.859
Listen to me,
don't be all about

18:41.903 --> 18:42.991
just getting everybody drunk.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.732
I don't anyone puking
in my bathrooms.

18:44.775 --> 18:47.561
Always me.
I'm always the bad guy.

18:50.607 --> 18:55.351
<i>â™ª</i>

18:55.395 --> 18:57.092
All right, we're here.
Let's go.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.053
- Right?
- I don't know.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.881
God knows what you brought
in the house.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.361
You had orgies.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.102
Come on, we just got here.
Don't ruin my vacation.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.059
All right?
Come on, let's go.

19:09.626 --> 19:12.020
<i>â™ª</i>

19:12.063 --> 19:13.587
Oh, babe,
look how pretty this is.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.154
- I like it.
- I'm so happy

19:15.197 --> 19:16.633
that we're staying
at Melissa's house.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.722
- Yeah?
- I'm just--I don't know.

19:18.766 --> 19:21.551
Like, I can't wait to start
moving forward with recovery

19:21.595 --> 19:23.553
'cause, like, going to the
shore should be totally fun,

19:23.597 --> 19:25.381
and, like,
my first thought's always,

19:25.425 --> 19:26.991
"Well, what am I gonna do
about lunch?"

19:27.035 --> 19:29.516
Like, I don't want that to be
my first line of thinking,

19:29.559 --> 19:31.126
you know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, of course.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.389
I've just been worried about
this whole heart rate thing.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.391
IT's scary for me knowing

19:35.435 --> 19:38.655
that I could be really doing,
like, significant damage.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.179
It's just gonna be hard.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.487
Maybe, though, like, being away

19:44.531 --> 19:46.141
will take my mind
off of things, you know?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.751
- It usually does, yeah.
- And we'll have fun

19:47.795 --> 19:49.579
because, remember,
at Joe Gorga's house,

19:49.623 --> 19:51.712
everybody has to have sex.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.235
Lucky you.
What are you talking about?

19:54.628 --> 19:56.673
Frank, do you have
any extra hangers?

19:56.717 --> 20:00.416
I think so.
See what happened?

20:00.460 --> 20:02.244
- Come on, Frank.
- My girlfriend's over.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.941
During the orgasm,
she's kicking--

20:03.985 --> 20:06.292
Frank! Oh, my God.

20:06.335 --> 20:07.815
You're telling me
the whole time, in five years,

20:07.858 --> 20:09.773
you and David
haven't broken any furniture?

20:09.817 --> 20:11.297
- No!
- No?

20:11.340 --> 20:14.474
Don't bring up David.
You know, I feel bad.

20:14.517 --> 20:15.866
Like, I tunnel out
when I get emotional.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.520
Like, I try to not cry.

20:17.564 --> 20:20.262
Are you seriously telling me
that you're crying over David?

20:20.306 --> 20:21.481
I don't even think
you cried over our divorce.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.657
I cried.
You just didn't see me crying.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.658
Oh.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.094
What time is everybody
coming?

20:26.137 --> 20:28.488
Tomorrow. Tiki and Traci
are gonna stay with us.

20:28.531 --> 20:29.793
It's gonna be a packed house.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.621
Margaret and Joe and Jackie
and everyone.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.362
And I'm thinking,
let's do a beach day.

20:33.406 --> 20:35.886
And then tomorrow night
maybe by Teresa's.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.714
She wants to barbecue
or something, she said.

20:37.758 --> 20:39.847
- I hope Jen's not going.
- By the way,

20:39.890 --> 20:41.022
Jennifer rented
a shore house, too,

20:41.065 --> 20:42.676
like fricking around the block.

20:42.719 --> 20:45.722
Margaret like made up with her
I guess or whatever, whatever.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.463
You know me,
I don't trust this girl

20:47.507 --> 20:48.986
as far as I can throw her.
The fact that she would go

20:49.030 --> 20:52.251
after our livelihood
and say the word "crooks"?

20:52.294 --> 20:54.731
Like, you.
I really don't.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.559
All right, so what else
are we taking?

20:56.603 --> 20:58.605
Well, I'm only gonna be there
for two days, so...

20:58.648 --> 21:01.129
Oh, all right, well, listen,

21:01.172 --> 21:02.652
it's definitely I'd feel better

21:02.696 --> 21:05.002
if you were there with me
the whole time, but of course,

21:05.046 --> 21:06.656
I understand, you gotta work.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.485
Right. So Teresa
wasn't there the other night?

21:09.529 --> 21:12.314
No, because she's in Boston.
Louie's with her.

21:12.358 --> 21:13.794
Audriana has her dance.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.230
Is she gonna be
at the shore then?

21:15.274 --> 21:16.362
Yeah, they have
a shore house.

21:16.405 --> 21:20.496
And I had some progress
with Margaret.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.845
- Yeah?
- Baby steps.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.326
But then Dolores
was just yelling at me

21:24.370 --> 21:25.849
for not believing
that she's my friend.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.460
You know what?
Jackie had my back

21:27.503 --> 21:29.723
and I don't like that Dolores
did that to her,

21:29.766 --> 21:32.029
like the bulldog attack,
you know?

21:32.073 --> 21:35.859
I just feel like for as much
as Dolores was yelling

21:35.903 --> 21:37.513
that she is a friend,

21:37.557 --> 21:40.951
I feel like all of the proof
shows otherwise.

21:40.995 --> 21:43.389
<i>My loyalty was questioned</i> <i>
the other day.</i>

21:43.432 --> 21:44.825
Jackie said to Jennifer,

21:44.868 --> 21:46.827
"Dolores really
isn't your friend."

21:46.870 --> 21:48.698
And you know what else?
She's saying,

21:48.742 --> 21:51.048
"I just want Jennifer to know
I care about her."

21:51.092 --> 21:53.703
When we were leaving Teresa's
----ing party, we all said,

21:53.747 --> 21:56.184
"Oh, jeez,
we feel bad for Bill."

21:56.227 --> 21:58.447
And she goes, "I don't feel
bad for him because he

21:58.491 --> 22:00.580
shouldn't have stuck his dick
in somebody else."

22:00.623 --> 22:03.017
- Jennifer's leaving.
- I feel bad.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.366
Now we expose Bill.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.672
I feel worse for Jen
than I feel for Bill.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.108
Don't cheat on your wife then.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.850
How about you don't stick
your dick in someone else?

22:09.893 --> 22:11.373
She didn't say he shouldn't
have done that,

22:11.417 --> 22:13.070
she said it ----ing nasty.

22:13.114 --> 22:14.376
To me, it was vulgar.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.551
Jackie got a set of balls.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.292
<i>Watch your words.</i>

22:17.336 --> 22:19.381
You're still talking
about her husband,

22:19.425 --> 22:21.078
who she stayed with,
who she loves.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.297
But you know what, Frank?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.255
I'm not here to ----ing
prove my loyalty

22:24.299 --> 22:25.431
to any ----ing body.

22:25.474 --> 22:26.736
Good.
Because I'm gonna keep

22:26.780 --> 22:28.259
running over to you over there,
all right?

22:28.303 --> 22:29.391
I haven't seen that look
on your face

22:29.435 --> 22:31.262
in quite a long time,
all right?

22:31.306 --> 22:32.873
I know sh-- bothers you.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.962
You're at a vulnerable point
right now.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.398
Calm down, promise me.

22:36.442 --> 22:39.575
Look at me. Promise me.

22:39.619 --> 22:42.926
- Stay close. Stay close.
- All right. You got it.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.058
<i>Coming up...</i>

22:44.101 --> 22:45.799
Dolores, how are you
a loyal friend

22:45.842 --> 22:48.105
if you don't see that
what Margaret did was wrong?

22:48.149 --> 22:50.412
So we're gonna have to find
a way to make it nice.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.371
Just keep everybody away
from the pool.

23:02.293 --> 23:03.425
<i>â™ª</i>

23:03.469 --> 23:04.774
Margie.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.428
Joe, I don't want to show
my cooch caboodle.

23:06.472 --> 23:07.473
No, you wanna.

23:07.516 --> 23:08.822
We gotta get the luggage.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.171
There's so much stuff.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.434
- Thank you.
- Hi.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.610
Oh, my God,
little Goldschneiders.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.395
I'm excited for this trip.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.440
I'm gonna put
the big ones in first.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.528
Okay.

23:19.572 --> 23:20.573
Me and you will sit
in the back.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.052
Okay, perfect.

23:22.096 --> 23:25.316
All right, let's go, fellas.
I got to start drinking.

23:25.360 --> 23:31.366
<i>â™ª</i>

23:31.410 --> 23:35.283
- I have a brilliant idea.
- Oh, yeah!

23:35.326 --> 23:39.113
These people don't know
what they're in for, this one.

23:39.156 --> 23:41.768
- Oh, perfect. Thanks.
- Traci's here.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.596
Let me just put my cover-up on.

23:43.639 --> 23:47.426
<i>â™ª</i>

23:47.469 --> 23:48.949
- Mmm.
- Hi!

23:48.992 --> 23:51.952
Hell--welcome to Missy G's.

23:51.995 --> 23:53.475
I wouldn't want
to be anywhere else.

23:53.519 --> 23:56.043
- What about Joey G's?
- Joe, learn that we

23:56.086 --> 23:57.261
rule the roost
at the shore today.

23:57.305 --> 24:00.613
- Thank you!
- Wait, where is Tiki?

24:00.656 --> 24:03.224
Still back at home doing
his work today, so he's--

24:03.267 --> 24:04.573
Work?

24:04.617 --> 24:05.487
I know, he'll probably
meet us over at Teresa's.

24:05.531 --> 24:06.749
He's meeting us later.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.055
Must be spending
too much money.

24:08.098 --> 24:09.709
I'm very expensive, Joe.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.319
I know. You want some water?

24:11.362 --> 24:12.538
You should have some.
Come on, have some.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.104
Yeah, we're gonna get you--

24:14.148 --> 24:16.237
- I love it. This is so nice.
- Thank you.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.325
When is Jackie
and Marge coming?

24:17.368 --> 24:18.761
They're on their way
right now.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.284
Let me get my--

24:20.328 --> 24:21.982
Let me get my glass,
let me get my drink.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.897
Whoa. Thank God
I didn't take a big swallow.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.900
Who puts vodka in their thing?

24:26.943 --> 24:30.338
- I'm drunk.
- I like you a little drunk.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.514
<i>â™ª</i>

24:32.558 --> 24:34.211
So we're gonna get
to Melissa's

24:34.255 --> 24:37.301
and then we're gonna go to the
beach, we're gonna hang out.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.260
- Is Tiki coming down?
- Yeah.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.523
Tiki and Louie are really
good additions.

24:41.567 --> 24:42.481
They're good people.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.221
I mean, let's not exaggerate.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.571
I want to like Louie.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.311
I want to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

24:47.355 --> 24:49.052
But the jury's out right now.

24:49.096 --> 24:50.924
Let's not forget that
weird video, right?

24:50.967 --> 24:52.273
That was weird.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.404
And sh-- came out
again today.

24:53.448 --> 24:54.623
You're kidding.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.364
<i>- Again?</i> <i>
- It's all over social media.</i>

24:56.407 --> 24:58.148
<i>People said his family</i> <i>
doesn't like him,</i>

24:58.192 --> 24:59.541
<i>- Wow.</i> <i>
- Listen, we don't know</i>

24:59.585 --> 25:01.456
<i>if it's true,</i> <i>
but someone wants him dead.</i>

25:01.500 --> 25:03.197
<i>I mean, this stuff</i> <i>
keeps leaking.</i>

25:03.240 --> 25:04.285
How do you think Teresa's
gonna handle it

25:04.328 --> 25:06.287
when we're, like, all together?

25:06.330 --> 25:07.680
She's gonna do
exactly what she did

25:07.723 --> 25:08.898
at her last party.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.596
He doesn't owe anybody
an explanation.

25:10.639 --> 25:11.945
No! I'm not--

25:11.988 --> 25:13.599
This is my home,
give me the respect.

25:13.642 --> 25:15.949
Because if not,
it's not gonna be good.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.429
His past,
it's a little bizarre.

25:18.473 --> 25:19.953
Yeah.

25:19.996 --> 25:21.041
And she spends a lot of time
trying to shut it down.

25:21.084 --> 25:26.220
<i>â™ª</i>

25:27.090 --> 25:29.397
- We're here!
- Hooray!

25:29.440 --> 25:31.225
Let's just get the bags
from the car.

25:31.268 --> 25:32.705
Do you need the bra thingy?

25:32.748 --> 25:34.141
No. Leave those there.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.189
Yay!

25:39.233 --> 25:40.800
I'm gonna take off
my cover up.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.410
Just give me a few minutes.

25:42.453 --> 25:46.545
Let me go upstairs and change
because Teresa's on her way.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.418
<i>Can you get</i> <i>
more pepperoni, honey?</i>

25:50.461 --> 25:54.161
I'm hungry. Mmm.
- Want an Italian sausage?

25:54.204 --> 25:55.989
You always got to go
down that road.

25:56.032 --> 25:57.947
- There is no other road.
- Mmm.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.341
Talk about a wake-me-up
in the morning.

26:00.384 --> 26:03.170
- This one's drunk.
- Oh, I'm such a fun drunk.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.302
Thank you for driving.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.653
Oh, I see
these little hookers.

26:07.696 --> 26:09.089
Hey, you.

26:09.132 --> 26:10.264
Oh, she's still got more
here I can't take.

26:10.307 --> 26:11.439
- Oh, there's more here.
- Ding, dong.

26:11.482 --> 26:12.614
We didn't ring the doorbell.
- Oh!

26:12.658 --> 26:13.833
all: Hi!

26:13.876 --> 26:15.443
Oh, look at you!
Look at that little bod!

26:15.486 --> 26:18.272
- Whoo!
- Whoo! My vagina!

26:18.315 --> 26:20.666
Hi!

26:20.709 --> 26:22.102
- Hi, baby girl!
- Hi!

26:25.671 --> 26:27.629
I love it.

26:27.673 --> 26:30.197
Sh--, you guys, come in,
my back's out

26:30.240 --> 26:32.025
and I don't have
no underwear on!

26:32.068 --> 26:34.462
- I need a little bit.
- Just some water.

26:34.505 --> 26:35.942
Party house!

26:35.985 --> 26:38.509
<i>â™ª</i>

26:38.553 --> 26:42.252

Joe, I'm gonna throw up!

26:47.257 --> 26:48.563
- Joe?
- No.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.957
- It's good water actually.
- Oh, my God.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.004
<i>â™ª</i>

26:55.048 --> 26:58.051
Mom, I need you
to cut the pineapple.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.966
Okay, I'm coming.
All right.

27:00.009 --> 27:01.576
So into little squares
then, right?

27:01.620 --> 27:04.666
Oh, this pineapple's juicy.
We picked a good one.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.886
<i>â™ª</i>

27:06.929 --> 27:09.018
Okay, why don't you make one
that's just pineapple?

27:12.369 --> 27:15.024
- Hi.
- Hey, babe.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.896
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

27:16.939 --> 27:19.072
Good.
both: Mwah.

27:19.115 --> 27:21.857
Oh, my God, I'm so tired.
We drove home.

27:21.901 --> 27:22.858
You came back from Boston.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.207
- Yeah.
- Leave this here.

27:24.251 --> 27:25.774
We'll bring it
to your room after.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.689
Come on in. Where's Louie?
He's not with you?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.604
Louie's gonna come later.
He went home.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.475
He has three dogs.
- Okay.

27:31.519 --> 27:34.696
So this is a nice turn
of events, you staying with me.

27:34.740 --> 27:35.828
I know.

27:35.871 --> 27:36.829
Oh, my God.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.657
I mixed up my weekends,

27:38.700 --> 27:40.484
so I have Louie's parents

27:40.528 --> 27:42.095
coming to my shore house
this weekend.

27:42.138 --> 27:43.792
I have my kids.
I have his son.

27:43.836 --> 27:47.056
So it's really not gonna
be the relaxing weekend

27:47.100 --> 27:48.667
that I thought
I was gonna have.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.366
I gave you the room
down here so that

27:52.409 --> 27:54.368
you and Louie can have privacy.
- Thank you.

27:54.411 --> 27:55.848
I'm so excited
that Louie and Bill

27:55.891 --> 27:57.110
are gonna hang out again.

27:57.153 --> 27:58.502
Yeah.
Oh, my God, it's so nice.

27:58.546 --> 27:59.721
This is, like,
the kids' hangout, right?

27:59.765 --> 28:01.070
Yeah.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.637
But Jakey wants to go biking
with his friends,

28:02.681 --> 28:05.074
Gabby has a birthday party,
and Justin started tutoring.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.815
So they're gonna
just all come Friday.

28:06.859 --> 28:09.035
And honestly, we just sit
out here in the morning.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.819
Yeah. It's so nice.

28:10.863 --> 28:13.126
Yeah, it was
absolutely freezing in Boston.

28:13.169 --> 28:14.301
It's just you, him,
and Audriana?

28:14.344 --> 28:15.606
Yeah. You know, like,

28:15.650 --> 28:17.608
he didn't have to do that,
like come with me.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.480
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.

28:19.523 --> 28:22.788
Louie's got such a good heart
and I love how he's so into

28:22.831 --> 28:24.485
wanting to see Audriana.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.574
<i>She did post a picture of me,</i>

28:26.617 --> 28:29.055
<i>her, and Louie,</i> <i>
which is really cute.</i>

28:29.098 --> 28:30.839
- Aww. That's great.
- Yeah.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.581
<i>We had joining rooms,</i> <i>
so, like, the three of us</i>

28:33.624 --> 28:35.757
laid in bed together
and watched movies,

28:35.801 --> 28:39.543
we went to dinner, and
Audriana's like, "Mom, no PDA."

28:39.587 --> 28:42.111
You know, like--

28:42.155 --> 28:44.287
It was a lot being there.
- Yeah.

28:44.331 --> 28:46.202
I feel like I haven't seen you.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.987
I know. What did I miss?

28:48.030 --> 28:51.773
Well, Jackie's party, it was
tense for me walking in there,

28:51.817 --> 28:54.384
but Jackie, she was very nice,
I have to say.

28:54.428 --> 28:56.430
I mean, I'm glad that
she feels for you.

28:56.473 --> 28:58.258
Yeah.
And Jackie was telling me

28:58.301 --> 28:59.433
that she doesn't really think

28:59.476 --> 29:00.869
that Dolores
is a supportive friend.

29:00.913 --> 29:03.480
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. And Dolores is like,

29:03.524 --> 29:05.700
"Well, after I
talked to Margaret,

29:05.744 --> 29:09.399
I kind of think what she did
to you was not wrong either."

29:09.443 --> 29:11.575
- What?
- Yeah.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.795
And then, like, that's
when Jackie came over

29:13.839 --> 29:15.579
and, girl, it went left.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.277
Like, Paterson Dolores
came out.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.974
Oh, my God.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.454
Dolores is mad at me

29:20.497 --> 29:22.630
for listening to Jackie,

29:22.673 --> 29:25.807
but like, how are you
really a loyal friend

29:25.851 --> 29:27.722
if you don't see that
what Margaret did was wrong?

29:27.766 --> 29:29.289
- Yeah.
- So we're gonna have

29:29.332 --> 29:31.465
to find a way to make it nice.

29:31.508 --> 29:32.727
Listen, we're all
gonna go to the beach,

29:32.771 --> 29:34.337
so, you know, obviously
you're gonna come.

29:34.381 --> 29:35.904
- Yeah.
- And I'm staying with you.

29:35.948 --> 29:39.473
Can we just have the barbecue
at your house?

29:39.516 --> 29:40.953
Have everybody over here?

29:40.996 --> 29:42.389
Yeah, is that all right?
Like, do you mind?

29:42.432 --> 29:43.912
No, it--no.
No, it's all right. It's good.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.653
All right, we'll do it
outside right here.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.829
Let's just keep
everybody away from the pool.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.398
<i>Coming up...</i>

29:51.441 --> 29:52.878
Teresa just texted me
and was like,

29:52.921 --> 29:54.749
"Back up my boyfriend,
buh-buh-buh."

29:54.793 --> 29:56.142
Guess what.
You know what that means?

29:56.185 --> 29:58.840
She's gonna have
a ----ing freakout.

30:05.238 --> 30:08.807
<i>Are you guys ready</i> <i>
for the Jersey shore?</i>

30:08.850 --> 30:11.592
Put your bathing suits on,
and let's go!

30:11.635 --> 30:12.985
Oh.

30:13.028 --> 30:14.856
I know it's heavy,
I'm sorry.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.423
- Oh.
- Wait.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.033
Wait? Ooh.

30:18.077 --> 30:19.861
I've never been on a bed
with another woman in 10 years.

30:19.905 --> 30:22.168
Do it, do it, do it, do it!
both: Ooh!

30:22.211 --> 30:23.647
Wait, do you want me
to close the door?

30:23.691 --> 30:25.954
- Yes, mind.
- Bom-chicka-bom-bom!

30:25.998 --> 30:28.870
All right. Come on, Joe,
I got to get changed.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.437
I think I should
wear my caftan.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.831
I'm gonna give everybody
their towel for showering.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.876
- Ooh, yeah.
- Oh, you like my ass?

30:34.920 --> 30:36.312
That's nice.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.358
I'm trying to see
your wife's cha-ching-ching.

30:38.401 --> 30:39.968
What do you mean "trying"?
You've seen it 10 times.

30:40.012 --> 30:43.406
- I know.
- Oh, she's in! Ooh!

30:43.450 --> 30:45.887
I see a vagina.

30:45.931 --> 30:46.888
Look at yours
compared to mine.

30:46.932 --> 30:47.889
Look at it.
- Bigger glass.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.239
Bigger glass.
- Size matters.

30:52.111 --> 30:55.288
Joe! I walk in Margaret's
bedroom, fully naked.

30:55.331 --> 30:58.595
I'm locking my door.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.075
- Oh!
- Oh! Look at Joe!

31:00.119 --> 31:02.556
You look so cute.
- Whoo!

31:02.599 --> 31:04.819
Marge, you got your sh--
aired out or what?

31:04.863 --> 31:05.907
Yeah.

31:05.951 --> 31:06.908
I have a bathing suit on.

31:06.952 --> 31:07.996
I can show my vagina now.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.824
- She goes, "Yeah."
- Hey.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.913
Have you been feeding him
that vodka?

31:11.957 --> 31:14.350
He's already sticking his sh--
on my back.

31:15.612 --> 31:19.268
<i>â™ª</i>

31:19.312 --> 31:22.228
- Teresa!
- Okay, I'm ready.

31:22.271 --> 31:24.447
- But Louie's coming?
- Yeah, he's on his way down.

31:24.491 --> 31:25.884
- So you ready to go then?
- Yeah.

31:25.927 --> 31:28.408
Let's go.

31:28.451 --> 31:29.583
Hello.

31:29.626 --> 31:32.978
<i>â™ª</i>

31:33.021 --> 31:34.805
<i>Guys, the car's here,</i> <i>
let's go.</i>

31:34.849 --> 31:37.243
- We gotta go.
- Let's have a beach day.

31:37.286 --> 31:39.506
Come on, get in, get in,
get in. Off we go.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.421
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

31:41.464 --> 31:45.207
<i>â™ª</i>

31:45.251 --> 31:46.600
A lot of people
on the beach.

31:46.643 --> 31:47.993
Remember when you used
to work out on the beach?

31:48.036 --> 31:50.430
Exactly. Where's my Speedos?

31:50.473 --> 31:52.780
<i>â™ª</i>

31:52.823 --> 31:53.955
- Coming, dear?
- Yeah.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.478
Oh, we're
the first ones here.

31:55.522 --> 31:58.351
- At least it's not raining.
- I know.

31:58.394 --> 32:00.092
Can I set you up
with something to drink?

32:00.135 --> 32:01.658
Yeah, can I have
a piÃ±a colada please?

32:01.702 --> 32:03.051
- Sure.
- Tito's and Red Bull.

32:03.095 --> 32:04.835
And a small piÃ±a colada.
- Sure.

32:04.879 --> 32:05.924
Thank you.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.013
<i>â™ª</i>

32:08.056 --> 32:09.971
- It's really pretty here.
- This is so nice.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.407
Oh, thank you.

32:11.451 --> 32:13.105
Don't go too far
because my friends are coming.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.977
- Oh, I see them.
- Hi, honey, what's up?

32:16.021 --> 32:17.022
- How are you?
- What's up, guys?

32:17.065 --> 32:19.763
Hi. How are you?
What's up, babe?

32:19.807 --> 32:21.200
- Mwah.
- Where's Bill?

32:21.243 --> 32:22.201
- Good. He's working.
- Is he gonna be coming?

32:22.244 --> 32:23.506
Tonight, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:23.550 --> 32:24.681
Can I start you off
with something to drink?

32:24.725 --> 32:25.987
I'll have Casamigos.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.293
- Do you want a piÃ±a colada?
- I'll take one.

32:27.336 --> 32:28.729
You want a piÃ±a colada?
There you go, babe.

32:28.772 --> 32:30.252
Can we get another piÃ±a colada
for me, too, please?

32:30.296 --> 32:32.124
- Okay, you got it.
- Thank you.

32:32.167 --> 32:34.474
- All right, thank you.
- Did I take yours?

32:34.517 --> 32:36.563
- He has a drink.
- I already got one drink.

32:36.606 --> 32:39.218
- Oh, my God, this is so nice.
- I know, right?

32:39.261 --> 32:41.829
I used to hang out here
all the time in my 20s.

32:41.872 --> 32:43.483
Oh, yeah, I know, right?

32:43.526 --> 32:47.574
Teresa was fist-pumping,
partying, doing it all.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.010
<i>It seems like yesterday.</i>

32:49.054 --> 32:51.056
<i>But growing up,</i> <i>
I was afraid of my dad.</i>

32:51.099 --> 32:52.666
The daughter of a cop,
you're not coming home

32:52.709 --> 32:54.059
<i>smoking pot, drinking,</i>

32:54.102 --> 32:55.538
<i>so I first started</i> <i>
going down the shore,</i>

32:55.582 --> 32:58.585
a lot of my experience
was very sober,

32:58.628 --> 33:02.154
going to the beach,
lying out, but very fun.

33:02.197 --> 33:06.549
So, Jennifer, how are you
feeling about today?

33:06.593 --> 33:07.898
I'm fine.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.639
Okay, you got a little
upset, but that's normal.

33:09.683 --> 33:12.077
So now you think I have
a right to be upset?

33:12.120 --> 33:14.079
Thank you, Dolores,
for acknowledging

33:14.122 --> 33:16.690
that it's actually normal
to be upset

33:16.733 --> 33:17.865
when the whole world finds out

33:17.908 --> 33:19.258
that your husband
cheated on you.

33:19.301 --> 33:21.086
Now I've had time to process.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.827
Normal beings have feelings.

33:23.871 --> 33:25.264
Who knew?

33:25.307 --> 33:27.135
- Hi, people.
- Hi.

33:27.179 --> 33:29.050
What's up, my man?

33:29.094 --> 33:30.530
What's up, baby?
How you doing, huh?

33:30.573 --> 33:32.880
- Everything good?
- What's going on?

33:32.923 --> 33:34.055
Hi, how are you?

33:34.099 --> 33:36.188
Hi, Dolores,
you look great.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.320
Hey, guys, I got
these two tables over here.

33:38.364 --> 33:40.061
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

33:40.105 --> 33:41.628
We're gonna do a round
of Casamigos shots.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.108
And a piÃ±a colada, please.

33:43.151 --> 33:44.500
Can I get wings?

33:44.544 --> 33:47.982
And a sweet potato pie
too please, thank you.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.810
Nice beach day, guys.

33:49.853 --> 33:51.899
I have been drinking
since 10:00 a.m.

33:51.942 --> 33:53.727
Who wants to be fondled
right now?

33:53.770 --> 33:56.469
Anyone? Anyone?

33:56.512 --> 33:57.470
After a couple drinks,

33:57.513 --> 33:59.080
she gets
a little more fondling.

33:59.124 --> 34:00.429
She's come close to ----ing

34:00.473 --> 34:02.301
finger banging me at times, Trace.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.392
So, Teresa, do you need
anything for tonight?

34:06.435 --> 34:07.741
Yeah, so, guys,
I don't know if you know,

34:07.784 --> 34:09.003
a switch of plans,

34:09.047 --> 34:10.439
we're gonna have
the barbecue tonight

34:10.483 --> 34:13.573
at Jen's house because
I'm staying at Jen's house

34:13.616 --> 34:15.618
because I have
a full house of children,

34:15.662 --> 34:16.924
but I'm still doing
the barbecue.

34:16.967 --> 34:19.013
We're just switching addresses.

34:19.057 --> 34:22.016
Yeah, I'm happy to welcome
all of you guys to the house.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.322
That is very nice.
Thank you.

34:23.365 --> 34:24.932
- Thank you.
- Appreciate that.

34:24.975 --> 34:27.239
- Here's to Louie and Tiki.
- Salut.

34:27.282 --> 34:29.806
Listen, I just want him
to be great to my sister.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.592
As long as she's happy,
takes care of those kids.

34:32.635 --> 34:35.116
- Do the kids like him?
- I think so.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.596
- Yeah?
- I think so.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.772
- Wait, so Tre, where's Louie?
- He's driving down.

34:38.815 --> 34:39.903
- Okay.
- Yeah, I mean--

34:39.947 --> 34:40.904
Is he gonna come
straight here?

34:40.948 --> 34:42.602
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yes.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.125
We're gonna go
to the ladies' room.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.561
I need to pee too.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.563
Dolores!
Stand back up a second.

34:47.607 --> 34:49.652
We're just looking
at your side boob.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.611
Oh, do they ever grow up?

34:51.654 --> 34:53.003
She wants to
kill you right now.

34:53.047 --> 34:54.135
She's still wondering

34:54.179 --> 34:55.615
whether you had sex
with Dolores.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.138
Did you have sex with
Dolores when you were young?

34:57.182 --> 34:58.792
No, never.

34:58.835 --> 35:01.447
When I went home that night,
she woke up at 2:00

35:01.490 --> 35:03.405
and she was standing over me
like the exorcist, right?

35:03.449 --> 35:04.406
Looking up--

35:11.021 --> 35:12.632
I'm coming over here.

35:12.675 --> 35:15.635
Wait, so Teresa is staying
at Jennifer's house?

35:15.678 --> 35:17.071
I guess 'cause she has
a house full of kids.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.291
Is Louie sleeping at
Jennifer's house too though?

35:19.334 --> 35:20.944
- Guess so.
- No, listen, listen,

35:20.988 --> 35:23.164
she has a lot of kids
that have a lot of friends.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.166
It's like a tornado hit it
all the time.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.821
All right, Louie has to be
able to deal with that.

35:27.864 --> 35:30.040
Listen, you know Louie
much better than I do.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.651
And she seems very happy,

35:31.694 --> 35:34.001
Joe and I, obviously,
we're hearing stuff.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.177
Can I check you right now?
And you guys are all gonna

35:36.221 --> 35:39.702
agree that this guy
is charming as sh-- in person.

35:39.746 --> 35:41.574
But we see Teresa's face
when she's with him.

35:41.617 --> 35:44.011
<i>He's good to her,</i> <i>
with her every night and day.</i>

35:44.054 --> 35:45.969
I mean, how do you
question the guy?

35:46.013 --> 35:48.146
He is charming,
he's good-looking.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.756
So is a car salesman.

35:49.799 --> 35:52.541
There's so much crap
coming out about him.

35:52.585 --> 35:55.414
But you know what?
Sometimes,

35:55.457 --> 35:58.504
when there's much smoke,
there's got to be some fire.

35:58.547 --> 36:00.201
You know, that's upsetting.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.203
So just, like, address it,
you know?

36:02.247 --> 36:04.249
- Right.
- I gotta run.

36:04.292 --> 36:05.685
Sorry, it's hot.
- I'm good with the sunscreen.

36:05.728 --> 36:06.686
It is hot, right?

36:09.645 --> 36:11.256
Great, thank you.

36:11.299 --> 36:12.779
Okay, all right. Food.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.215
I'm, like, weak.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.086
Listen, I just want
to relax.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.610
This is the first time

36:17.653 --> 36:20.352
I'm down the shore by myself
since David and I broke up.

36:20.395 --> 36:22.049
So it's just really done?
That's it?

36:22.092 --> 36:24.182
I didn't hear from him again.

36:24.225 --> 36:26.706
- That's ----ed up.
- I haven't told Teresa.

36:28.098 --> 36:29.448
What?

36:29.491 --> 36:32.146
That David and I broke up
like over a week ago.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.756
What, what?

36:33.800 --> 36:36.542
Why didn't you text me
and tell me?

36:36.585 --> 36:39.240
Because it wasn't easy
for me to even talk about

36:39.284 --> 36:40.502
and then the other thing is

36:40.546 --> 36:43.026
I'm taking it very bad, horrible.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.202
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.204
Who's this? Who got tacos?
Traci?

36:46.247 --> 36:47.292
Me. I'm gonna sit
this way though

36:47.335 --> 36:48.815
because
I want my back to the sun.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.643
Wait, what day did you
break up with him?

36:50.686 --> 36:53.254
Was it the day
of Jackie's party?

36:53.298 --> 36:55.474
You were ----ing bananas
that day.

36:55.517 --> 36:58.346
You know she ----ing blew up
at Jackie out of nowhere.

36:58.390 --> 36:59.913
Now, I know you got
a hot temper,

36:59.956 --> 37:02.350
but like, now it makes sense.

37:02.394 --> 37:03.830
But then she ended up
getting mad at me towards

37:03.873 --> 37:06.093
the end and I was like--
- Listen, Jennifer,

37:06.136 --> 37:08.269
I'm sorry that you were hurt,

37:08.313 --> 37:10.445
but you want to know
what really got me?

37:10.489 --> 37:11.707
Why is Jackie coming,

37:11.751 --> 37:13.622
all of a sudden
being friends with you

37:13.666 --> 37:15.537
when you're fighting
with her friends?

37:15.581 --> 37:18.279
Well, I feel like she knows
what I'm going through

37:18.323 --> 37:20.847
and realizes
how cruel this was to me.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.936
You want to know something?
Your friend over here?

37:22.979 --> 37:24.677
You know what she said when
we were leaving her party?

37:24.720 --> 37:26.505
"I don't care,
he shouldn't have

37:26.548 --> 37:28.376
stuck his dick
in somebody else."

37:28.420 --> 37:32.337
- Who said that?
- Jackie. She's a friend?

37:32.380 --> 37:34.556
This is the most disgusting,
vile thing

37:34.600 --> 37:36.558
that anybody could ever say.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.300
Jennifer,
she's ----ing playing you,

37:39.344 --> 37:40.736
don't be a pussy about this.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.869
It's ----ing gross.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.268
Guess what, Jennifer.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.791
Your friend over here,

37:51.834 --> 37:53.532
you know what she said
when we were leaving her party?

37:53.575 --> 37:55.185
"I don't care,
he shouldn't have

37:55.229 --> 37:58.058
stuck his dick
in somebody else."

37:58.101 --> 38:00.800
That is the most
disgusting thing

38:00.843 --> 38:02.497
that anybody could ever say.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.891
That's ----ing gross.

38:04.934 --> 38:06.284
She ----ing said that?

38:06.327 --> 38:08.198
<i>Saying that about</i> <i>
somebody's husband</i>

38:08.242 --> 38:10.244
who actually did
have an affair?

38:10.288 --> 38:12.464
That's just cruel.
Who else heard it?

38:12.507 --> 38:13.900
It's a blur to me.

38:13.943 --> 38:15.293
<i>I thought she was my friend.</i>

38:15.336 --> 38:17.382
Or I thought she wanted
to try to be my friend.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.079
How about that? No?

38:19.122 --> 38:21.516
Listen, at what point did
she start to feel bad for me?

38:21.560 --> 38:22.952
I'm just curious.
I don't know.

38:22.996 --> 38:25.477
Was it right after she said it?

38:25.520 --> 38:26.782
Was it before she said it?

38:26.826 --> 38:31.221
So just open your eyes
a little bit, okay?

38:31.265 --> 38:33.702
Oh, Louie just--there's
so much traffic, I guess,

38:33.746 --> 38:36.314
he won't be at the house.
- Where's Louie?

38:36.357 --> 38:38.359
I just texted him, I said,
"Louie, where are you?"

38:38.403 --> 38:39.795
What did he say?

38:39.839 --> 38:43.103
He says, "Driving down,
had so much work."

38:43.146 --> 38:44.452
- Okay.
- All right.

38:44.496 --> 38:45.888
Whoo, it's hot.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.325
You guys want to go
in the ocean for a swim?

38:47.368 --> 38:49.370
No. I need a drink
and air conditioning.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.154
You wanna go back
to the house, go in the pool?

38:51.198 --> 38:52.504
- Yes, I'll go in the pool.
- Yes.

38:52.547 --> 38:53.722
Let's go, babe.

38:53.766 --> 38:55.028
I need an iced coffee
like pronto.

38:55.071 --> 38:56.377
I am sweating terribly.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.336
All right, guys,
we'll see you later.

38:58.379 --> 38:59.598
All right, I'm gonna go

38:59.641 --> 39:00.686
to her house then
I'll see you guys tonight.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.209
- Okay.
- Ciao, bella.

39:02.252 --> 39:03.471
Ciao, bella.
Ciao, bella.

39:03.515 --> 39:05.212
Okay, let's go.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.259
- Where was Louie today?
- Maybe he doesn't want

39:09.303 --> 39:11.174
to deal with us,
all of us together.

39:11.218 --> 39:12.828
He's probably like,
"that."

39:14.308 --> 39:17.529
<i>â™ª</i>

39:17.572 --> 39:18.921
Oh, it was so hot out there

39:18.965 --> 39:19.966
I was getting a headache.

39:20.009 --> 39:21.010
Oh, dude, I'm tired.

39:21.054 --> 39:22.142
And we got to go
to this barbecue?

39:22.185 --> 39:23.578
Can I just rest
for a little while?

39:23.622 --> 39:24.666
Yeah.
I'm gonna go get dressed.

39:24.710 --> 39:25.841
Guys, you hear that? Come on.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.495
Come sit with me.
Stay away from her.

39:30.542 --> 39:31.673
<i>â™ª</i>

39:31.717 --> 39:33.109
Home, sweet home.

39:33.153 --> 39:34.589
Oof.
- Want an espresso?

39:34.633 --> 39:36.765
Margaret's making
iced coffee.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.245
- All right.
- I got to shower,

39:38.288 --> 39:40.595
do my makeup, make a doodie,
and have an iced coffee.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.510
Oh, my gosh, she did not.

39:42.554 --> 39:47.472
<i>â™ª</i>

39:47.515 --> 39:49.430
Okay, finally we're home.

39:49.474 --> 39:54.914
<i>â™ª</i>

39:54.957 --> 39:57.873
All right, the chef's
gonna be here any minute.

39:57.917 --> 39:59.614
So we'll start preparing.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.877
So nice, air conditioning.

40:01.921 --> 40:06.708
- Mom!
- Hi, my babies.

40:06.752 --> 40:10.712
- Aww.
- What you guys doing?

40:10.756 --> 40:12.235
Who's here, Erica?

40:13.802 --> 40:15.413
The florist left?

40:16.588 --> 40:20.069
Okay, thank you. Okay.

40:20.113 --> 40:21.419
Oh, the chef.
I think he's here.

40:21.462 --> 40:22.550
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

40:22.594 --> 40:23.421
- I'll go get it.
- You'll go get it?

40:23.464 --> 40:24.813
Mm-hmm.

40:27.250 --> 40:29.949
- Hi.
- Hi, come on in.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.868
I feel like you'll have
enough time if you leave now.

40:35.911 --> 40:38.479
All right, Jen,
I'm gonna go get ready.

40:38.523 --> 40:40.089
All right, babe,
I'll see you later.

40:40.133 --> 40:41.482
- All right.
- It's a little slow starting.

40:41.526 --> 40:42.570
Okay.

40:42.614 --> 40:44.267
Do you think this
is enough space?

40:44.311 --> 40:46.705
Absolutely.
We can start getting set up.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.924
- Okay, great.
- Thank you, ladies.

40:48.968 --> 40:51.753
<i>â™ª</i>

40:53.189 --> 40:54.930
- Hello? <i>
- Hey, Teresa.</i>

40:54.974 --> 40:56.976
Hi. How far away are you?

40:57.629 --> 40:58.804
Okay.

41:00.153 --> 41:03.199
Why? Oh, I'm mic-ed.

41:03.809 --> 41:06.333
All right.

41:06.376 --> 41:08.117
I'm gonna bring the guys
their iced coffee.

41:08.161 --> 41:10.032
- I'm gonna go take a shower.
- Go ahead.

41:10.076 --> 41:11.512
You start, because everyone's
gonna want to go in

41:11.556 --> 41:12.557
at the same time, you know?

41:12.600 --> 41:14.646
Yes.

41:14.689 --> 41:17.300
The pool is wonderful.

41:17.344 --> 41:20.042
Oh, God,
it's always something.

41:20.086 --> 41:21.827
Teresa just texted me
and was like,

41:21.870 --> 41:24.482
"Do not say a word, make sure
you do the right thing,

41:24.525 --> 41:26.309
back up my boyfriend,
buh-buh-buh."

41:26.353 --> 41:29.138
It's weird Louie didn't
show up to the beach.

41:29.182 --> 41:30.792
Guess what.
You know what that means?

41:30.836 --> 41:32.228
She's gonna have
a ----ing freakout.

41:32.272 --> 41:33.882
That's what that means.

41:33.926 --> 41:35.318
- Mm-hmm. <i>
- Teresa's no dummy.</i>

41:35.362 --> 41:37.495
Even if we don't talk
about Louie to her face,

41:37.538 --> 41:39.714
<i>she must realize</i> <i>
that everyone's talking.</i>

41:39.758 --> 41:41.542
I mean, I guess we shall see.

41:41.586 --> 41:42.804
<i>And she basically</i> <i>
just told us all,</i>

41:42.848 --> 41:44.371
"Hmm, you better shut up."

41:44.414 --> 41:45.546
So I don't know.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.374
There might be
a little chaos tonight.

41:47.417 --> 41:48.636
<i>â™ª</i>

41:50.725 --> 41:51.987
What happened with Louie?

41:53.380 --> 41:54.337
What?

41:57.689 --> 41:58.690
No.

41:58.733 --> 42:02.650
<i>â™ª</i>

42:02.694 --> 42:03.956
I told him not to come around
if he feels like that.

42:03.999 --> 42:05.174
Well, so...

42:05.218 --> 42:06.698
<i>Louie did not</i> <i>
sign up for this.</i>

42:06.741 --> 42:08.743
To be antagonized,

42:08.787 --> 42:10.571
<i>to be questioned, anything.</i>

42:10.615 --> 42:12.007
I told him, like,
"You don't deserve this."

42:12.051 --> 42:13.835
He does not
have to prove anything.

42:13.879 --> 42:15.489
I'm in the public eye,
not Louie.

42:17.404 --> 42:18.927
I don't want to discuss it.

42:18.971 --> 42:20.146
<i>He's the love of my life.</i>

42:20.189 --> 42:22.017
Like, I want to protect him.

42:22.061 --> 42:24.237
They're not happy for us.
They want to sabotage us.

42:25.107 --> 42:26.587
I'm leaving.

42:26.631 --> 42:30.199
I swear to God
you guys are the devil.

42:30.243 --> 42:31.984
Why are you still filming?

42:32.027 --> 42:34.464
Go yourself.
I'm serious.

42:37.467 --> 42:44.431
