<i>Previously on "The Real</i> <i>
Housewives of New Jersey"...</i>

00:03.829 --> 00:04.917
I'm gonna invite everyone

00:04.961 --> 00:06.093
to come down
to our shore house.

00:06.136 --> 00:07.311
We're gonna open up Missy G's.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.791
Audriana? She had dance.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.010
Okay.

00:10.053 --> 00:10.880
I'm going to Boston
for a week.

00:10.923 --> 00:11.968
She has nationals.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.665
This is unfinished.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.058
The molding is not done.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.364
I cannot wait
till the house is done.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.192
Well, I got news for you.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.845
Dad's coming home.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.195
<i>♪</i>

00:21.238 --> 00:23.240
I'm looking to move
back into Dolores' house.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.198
Dolores sends out
a group text message.

00:24.241 --> 00:25.373
"Family meeting."

00:25.416 --> 00:26.635
You know
they're gonna kill you.

00:26.678 --> 00:27.810
"What the [BLEEP]?
Why isn't the house done?

00:27.853 --> 00:29.029
Etcetera.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.073
I'm so scared
of gaining weight,

00:30.117 --> 00:31.553
and I'm hungry all the time.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.381
That's why I think you
should see somebody, sweetie.

00:33.424 --> 00:37.515
I'm afraid that I'm gonna
relapse and kill myself.

00:37.559 --> 00:40.344
In this video,
Louie is on the beach

00:40.388 --> 00:42.433
<i>in the middle</i> <i>
of this pack of men.</i>

00:42.477 --> 00:43.608
<i>Louie should just</i> <i>
address the video.</i>

00:43.652 --> 00:45.349
You can't have
all this sh-- out there

00:45.393 --> 00:46.437
and expect no one to talk
about it; I'm sorry.

00:46.481 --> 00:47.656
You always say,
"Bill's the best."

00:47.699 --> 00:49.049
He had an affair.
- You're jealous.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.354
Everybody knows.

00:50.398 --> 00:51.703
Don't cry because
there's no reason to.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.879
You think I'm ----ing weak
for crying?

00:53.923 --> 00:55.316
I'm not weak for crying.

00:55.359 --> 00:56.708
Let me tell you something, Jennifer.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.188
I don't think Dolores

00:58.232 --> 01:00.843
is just being the kind
of friend you need right now.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.498
- Do I support you or no?
- I would love more.

01:03.541 --> 01:04.977
Fine, then I'll work on that.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.718
But I don't need
to hear from this.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.068
Don't ----ing call me--

01:08.111 --> 01:08.981
What are you
gonna do about it?

01:09.025 --> 01:10.548
Frank.

01:10.592 --> 01:11.767
Really, what the
are you gonna do about it?

01:11.810 --> 01:12.985
Frank.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.291
Don't ----ing talk
in my face.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.337
Don't talk in my ----ing face.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.252
What are you--
what is going on here?

01:18.295 --> 01:19.731
<i>What is going on here?</i> <i>
- No, I don't want--</i>

01:19.775 --> 01:21.733
- Don't ----ing--
- All right, no, all right.

01:21.777 --> 01:24.214
Don't ----ing talk
in my ----ing face.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.520
What is going on here?

01:25.563 --> 01:27.261
- What's happening?
- What's the matter?

01:27.304 --> 01:28.871
She gets on my nerves.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.307
I've known Dolores
since she was 19 years old.

01:30.351 --> 01:32.092
<i>Dolores grew up</i> <i>
on the streets of Paterson.</i>

01:32.135 --> 01:33.180
<i>She's a street fighter.</i>

01:33.223 --> 01:35.182
<i>She got in a fight in a bar,</i>

01:35.225 --> 01:36.618
she bit through the girl--
two of her nails.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.228
- She's heated.
- Yeah.

01:38.272 --> 01:39.838
When Dolores
goes into a rage,

01:39.882 --> 01:42.058
you need to separate her.
- Hey, sweetie.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.755
Dolores referred to me
as "this."

01:43.799 --> 01:45.757
She doesn't know
who she's dealing with.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.411
Or she'll do something
that she's gonna regret.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.239
- I'm good.
- Yeah, all right.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.936
If you think
I'm not your friend,

01:50.980 --> 01:53.504
if you think I should support
you more, you don't tell her.

01:53.548 --> 01:54.679
I was just being honest.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.290
I didn't think it was
gonna start--

01:56.333 --> 01:57.421
You're not that
close with her.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.510
We're starting,
we're starting.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.904
But then she wants
to pick apart your friendship.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.340
I'm not picking apart
your friendships.

02:03.384 --> 02:06.082
I'm telling her
so she doesn't rely on somebody

02:06.126 --> 02:07.649
who's not gonna follow through.

02:07.692 --> 02:10.608
Dolores wants to come for me
because I'm the first one

02:10.652 --> 02:12.523
with balls to call her out
on her bullsh--.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.612
I've done more
for my friends

02:14.656 --> 02:17.049
than you would ever do
in a million years.

02:17.093 --> 02:18.790
You have no idea what I do.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.663
And not only am I
zero percent scared of her,

02:21.706 --> 02:23.882
I'm also not going to pretend
she's a good friend

02:23.926 --> 02:25.188
to Jennifer when she's not.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.059
I can be friends
with both of them,

02:27.103 --> 02:28.670
and I don't have to take sides.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.802
I'm going through
an emotional ringer right now.

02:30.846 --> 02:34.632
David and I aren't together.
I'm very hurt.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.330
<i>Everybody should go</i> <i>
themselves</i>

02:36.373 --> 02:37.809
because I know who I am,
and I know

02:37.853 --> 02:41.161
how I've backed every one
of these mother----ers.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.640
They can work it out themselves.

02:42.684 --> 02:45.339
Last time, Jennifer
didn't want to talk about it.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.776
All right.
We can talk about it.

02:47.819 --> 02:50.126
Okay, fine,
then we'll let them talk.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.867
So then let's talk,
me and you.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.869
Okay.

02:53.912 --> 02:55.740
I don't want
to have issues with you,

02:55.784 --> 02:57.264
but you've had
a double standard

02:57.307 --> 02:59.091
about that I had an affair.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.484
You've crucified me for it.

03:00.528 --> 03:01.833
- It's not the same.
- It's the judging--

03:01.877 --> 03:04.009
It is the same.
Your husband was like me.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.838
And then you called me slutty
for the same behavior.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.058
That's what it was.

03:09.101 --> 03:10.494
Okay. That's fair.

03:10.538 --> 03:13.193
I went in on you
a little bit too much

03:13.236 --> 03:14.672
with your relationships.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.284
<i>I'm just starting to realize</i> <i>
now that the way</i>

03:17.327 --> 03:20.591
that she's been boasting
about her affair

03:20.635 --> 03:22.245
was a real trigger for me.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.986
I was quick to judge.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.640
<i>I think, you know,</i> <i>
what if this girl</i>

03:25.683 --> 03:27.685
that Bill cheated on me with
was going around

03:27.729 --> 03:30.862
bragging about her affair
with my husband?

03:30.906 --> 03:35.345
I mean, if I ever heard that,
it's so heart-wrenching.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.694
But I still gotta tell you, like,

03:36.738 --> 03:39.871
I still feel so hurt
by what you did.

03:39.915 --> 03:42.091
Listen, my only motivation
in all of this

03:42.134 --> 03:44.267
was to make sure she's
surrounded by people who--

03:44.311 --> 03:45.747
You questioning
my friendship to her...

03:45.790 --> 03:46.661
Yeah, I did.

03:46.704 --> 03:47.705
And she did too.
- Was wrong.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.577
If I thought
she was really that bad,

03:49.620 --> 03:50.926
I've been there for friends--
I'll call and say,

03:50.969 --> 03:53.711
"Do you need me?"
But this, I think she's okay.

03:53.755 --> 03:56.018
Dolores just brushes off
everybody's feelings.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.063
I'm tired of this
whole thing with Jackie.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.282
Get over it.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.718
I don't want
to hear it anymore.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.372
When I was going through
all the infidelity rumors

04:02.416 --> 04:04.722
last year, I was not okay.

04:04.766 --> 04:07.899
It put me in a really dangerous
path with my eating disorder.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.205
- Are with happy with--
- I don't think she's okay

04:09.249 --> 04:10.380
if she leaves crying.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.077
And a real friend
doesn't just assume

04:12.121 --> 04:14.558
that you're gonna get
through it and you're fine.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.691
Not everybody does things
the same, Jackie.

04:16.734 --> 04:19.084
But I'll be there for her
if she needs me.

04:19.128 --> 04:22.305
Listen, you ambushed me
to intentionally hurt me.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.741
I didn't ambush you.
I didn't--

04:23.785 --> 04:25.047
It's how I felt.
It's how I feel.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.353
But you knew about it.

04:26.396 --> 04:27.919
Do you understand why
I kept it a secret?

04:27.963 --> 04:30.487
You must understand.
It was for him.

04:30.531 --> 04:31.575
- From what?
- My kids are still little.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.011
They look up to their father.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.100
I'm part of the Syrian
Orthodox community.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.450
They want--no, Bill.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.408
I don't want him
to be humiliated.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.931
He's not gonna be humiliated.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.411
You know, it's always
about, like, protecting him.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.544
My family's name, my in-laws.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.110
Like, they're gonna blame me
for everything.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.764
What are they gonna say?
What are they gonna say?

04:46.808 --> 04:49.332
I wouldn't be surprised if
they thought I was a bad wife,

04:49.376 --> 04:51.378
<i>that I wasn't sleeping</i> <i>
with him enough.</i>

04:51.421 --> 04:53.684
You're putting on this front
trying to cover up everything.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.165
You don't have to ----ing
hit it home how great he is.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.298
But that makes me happy
to say how great he is.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.429
Of course.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.996
Do I want another
infidelity?

05:01.039 --> 05:02.650
Or I gotta keep gassing my
husband--you know what I mean?

05:02.693 --> 05:04.260
No, you don't have to.
That's not why he--

05:04.304 --> 05:05.827
- Like, we make it work now.
- That's not why it happened.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.612
You do a great job.
That's not why it happened.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.484
This girl and I
are further apart

05:10.527 --> 05:12.181
than I even realized.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.139
You had nothing to ----ing do
with it, believe me.

05:14.183 --> 05:17.099
She's brainwashed to think
that all women are blamed

05:17.142 --> 05:18.492
for men's poor behavior,

05:18.535 --> 05:20.755
not just the other woman,
but the wife too.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.496
It's actually very, very sad.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.846
I just don't want to hurt him.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.501
You're not hurting him.
You're the one that's hurt.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.111
I want them to work it out.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.156
Then they have to figure it
out between the two of them.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.028
- What am I gonna say?
- Hi. Are you guys good?

05:33.071 --> 05:34.072
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:34.116 --> 05:36.074
We know how to talk
like adults.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.293
All right, so are you

05:37.337 --> 05:38.599
gonna be down
the shore this week?

05:38.642 --> 05:39.600
- Yeah.
- Okay, 'cause I'm gonna

05:39.643 --> 05:41.166
go down, and, like,

05:41.210 --> 05:42.124
I think we should, like,
hang out.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.343
Yeah. Definitely.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.256
You know, Teresa rented
a shore house.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.475
She's in Lavallette.

05:45.519 --> 05:46.737
Yeah, and if you'd
like to come down--

05:46.781 --> 05:47.869
Why?

05:47.912 --> 05:49.261
Why don't you sleep over
one night?

05:49.305 --> 05:50.698
I feel like I want to throw
a little pink party,

05:50.741 --> 05:52.308
opposed to a white party.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.050
- I would love...
- Come on, let's go.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.356
Let's go.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.403
- Look at them.
- Frank is doing a keg stand.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.187
Oh, I would love
to see that.

06:02.231 --> 06:03.188
Oh!

06:03.232 --> 06:05.060
Oh, oh!

06:05.103 --> 06:07.802
Jennifer, I do not want
to hurt you.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.238
Ahh!

06:09.281 --> 06:11.936
Oh, sh--!

06:11.980 --> 06:13.373
- Ooh!
- Oh!

06:13.416 --> 06:14.417
I don't want to see you
crying and leaving events.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.766
Same.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.855
I would like to move
past it, okay?

06:17.899 --> 06:19.683
All right. Listen.
We're gonna put this to bed.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.076
All our dirty laundry's
out there.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.425
It's done, it's over.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.514
We don't talk
about infidelities.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.907
Hi. We're much better.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.256
- Yeah?
- We're much better.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.692
- Good. Oh, I'm happy.
- We're baby steps, yeah.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.738
Well, 'cause Melissa
was talking about

06:30.781 --> 06:32.740
everybody coming down
to the shore next weekend.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.045
I know you have a house.
- She got a house.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.438
Yeah, I do. Yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.570
Yeah,
we have to have a good time.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.398
Traci's doing it.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.573
Oh, the hair went back,
it's real.

06:39.616 --> 06:40.878
Don't spill it.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.227
- I'm so ready--
- She's having a better time.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.446
Go!

06:43.490 --> 06:46.406
- One, two!
- Are you guys good?

06:46.449 --> 06:47.537
You're okay?
- I don't know.

We're going

Baby steps.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.371
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

06:55.415 --> 06:58.766
You want to continue
this party at my shore house.

06:58.809 --> 07:01.986
I'm gonna get a ----ing keg.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.041

- That was different.
- What are you trying to say?

That your boyfriend

07:15.826 --> 07:17.567
don't have sex

07:17.611 --> 07:19.439

All right,
the first thing we'll talk

08:28.595 --> 08:30.901
a lot about
is your medical history

08:30.945 --> 08:32.512
and your eating patterns
in detail.

08:32.555 --> 08:33.991
- Okay.
- And I definitely

08:34.035 --> 08:35.515
encourage you

That way, we can really

- Sounds good.
- Sounds okay?

08:39.562 --> 08:40.824
Yeah.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.131
So, first, how did you
initially hear about us?

08:43.174 --> 08:44.480
I've always known
about Renfrew.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.656
I've been struggling
with an eating disorder

08:46.700 --> 08:48.179
for 20 years, so...

08:48.223 --> 08:52.357
Renfrew is the preeminent
treatment center

08:52.401 --> 08:55.143
for people suffering
from eating disorders.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.145
Was there anything
in particular

08:57.188 --> 08:58.538
that caused you
to want to reach out?

08:58.581 --> 09:00.496
My kids
are getting older and...

09:00.540 --> 09:02.672
apparently noticing
certain things.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.456
What did they say to you?

09:04.500 --> 09:05.414
They said,
"Why is Mom eating

09:05.457 --> 09:07.024
the same dinner every night?"

09:07.068 --> 09:08.373
I know at some point

09:08.417 --> 09:11.333
I have to stop what I'm doing
and get started.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.987
If you wouldn't mind
letting me know

09:13.030 --> 09:15.293
when in your life you started
to make intentional changes

09:15.337 --> 09:16.860
around what you were
eating every day.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.993
Okay. I've always been
concerned about my body image.

09:19.036 --> 09:21.822
<i>As a senior in high school,</i> <i>
I went on Weight Watchers.</i>

09:21.865 --> 09:24.651
<i>And then I went to college,</i> <i>
and I really wanted to be thin</i>

09:24.694 --> 09:26.174
<i>so I was cutting</i> <i>
more and more.</i>

09:26.217 --> 09:28.437
And I just got to a place
where I just had

09:28.480 --> 09:30.352
cut everything out of my diet.

09:30.395 --> 09:31.745
<i>When I was in high school,</i>

09:31.788 --> 09:35.009
I remember a guy once saying
that he loves a girl

09:35.052 --> 09:36.750
that he can pick up
with his pinkie.

09:36.793 --> 09:39.883
Those were the girls that
everyone wanted to be around.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.537
Do you feel like
you're currently

09:41.581 --> 09:43.365
kind of counting
your calories in any way?

09:43.408 --> 09:44.932
I'm always counting my
calories, every single calorie.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.674
<i>When I finally got there</i> <i>
and people were paying me</i>

09:47.717 --> 09:51.025
so much attention,
I just never wanted to leave.

09:51.068 --> 09:54.506
I give myself
two to three meals a week

09:54.550 --> 09:57.161
that are foods
that are different.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.120
The rest of my meals are salad.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.382
Lots of lettuce.
- Lettuce.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.384
Yeah. So I worry about

10:02.427 --> 10:04.038
I'm not getting any nutrients
from my food.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.517
All right. Right now,

10:05.561 --> 10:07.302
I want to talk about current
medical symptoms

10:07.345 --> 10:08.520
you might be experiencing.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.522
Any, like, numbness
or tingling?

10:10.566 --> 10:12.699
Yeah, sometimes
my fingertips go numb.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.309
- Okay.
- Yeah.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.485
And do you ever feel like
you're cold a lot of the time?

10:16.528 --> 10:17.965
Yes, I'm always cold.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.532
And do you ever notice
lightheadedness or dizziness?

10:20.576 --> 10:23.100
I have a really
slow heart rate.

10:23.144 --> 10:26.408
If I get up too quickly,
I'm always dizzy.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.498
- Okay.
- This definitely sounds

10:29.541 --> 10:31.500
like the kind of stuff
you can help with, right?

10:31.543 --> 10:35.025
Yes, but I think in order
to really be able to solidify

10:35.069 --> 10:36.723
what we'd want
to offer you next steps,

10:36.766 --> 10:40.074
we'd want you to see
your doctor too and, you know,

10:40.117 --> 10:41.423
have routine labs.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.251
There's an EKG
included in that,

10:43.294 --> 10:44.905
because your heart rate's
a little bit lower.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.384
Okay.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.908
I can't start treatment
until all that gets done?

10:47.951 --> 10:49.605
Yes.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.129
We'd want to make sure
your body is okay,

10:52.173 --> 10:53.870
and you definitely flagged,
you know,

10:53.914 --> 10:55.785
feeling that you're not eating
foods that are nutrient dense.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.701
So as you start to increase
your food intake,

10:58.745 --> 11:00.616
your circulation
actually increases.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.923
So that can cause your heart
or your other organs

11:02.966 --> 11:04.272
to get overwhelmed.
- Oh.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.969
So we've seen people
experience heart attacks

11:06.013 --> 11:07.231
or cardiac issues.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.842
Do you think
I'm at risk for that?

11:08.885 --> 11:10.626
You could be.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.629
We can't rule it out
until we get your medical.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.110
Okay, I'll do whatever
I have to do.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.214
Yeah.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.563
And that's why I called
a family meeting.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.870
Like, I want everybody
to get it off your chest.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.698
If anyone has preferences,
it's this one.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.352
I just think we have
to, like, set ground rules

12:24.395 --> 12:25.527
that, like, Frank
can't have guests.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.833
So if Dad
brings girls home...

12:26.876 --> 12:28.573
They can't be coming
around the house.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.837
Frank doesn't realize

13:23.063 --> 13:24.891

13:24.934 --> 13:26.675
I don't want any trouble
under this roof.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.416
I know you guys
have concerns.

13:28.459 --> 13:31.985
I know my lifestyle
is not exactly conducive

13:32.028 --> 13:33.769
to a normal family,

13:33.813 --> 13:35.423
but I'm still
the ----ing father.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.772
But it's about
being respectful

13:36.816 --> 13:38.165
when there's other people
in the house.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.470
So what are you
trying to say?

13:39.514 --> 13:40.732
You know exactly
what I'm trying to say.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.517
No, I don't.
I'm not allowed to take

13:42.560 --> 13:44.432
a woman home to the house
and have sex with her?

13:44.475 --> 13:46.173
- Nope.
- Oh, my God.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.871
- No sleepovers.
- Why?

13:48.915 --> 13:50.351
Your girlfriend
doesn't stay over?

13:50.394 --> 13:52.005
Your boyfriend
doesn't stay over?

13:52.048 --> 13:53.354
- That was different.
- What are you trying to say?

13:53.397 --> 13:54.790
That your boyfriend
don't have sex

13:54.834 --> 13:56.705
when we're in the house?
- No--

13:56.748 --> 13:58.794
Frank, I don't talk like that.
We don't talk like that.

13:58.838 --> 13:59.969
No, no, no--

14:00.013 --> 14:00.752
We don't talk like that
with our kids.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.015
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.277
Nothing is loud enough

14:03.320 --> 14:04.626
that you can hear
three floors down.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.367
Like when your friend
from Texas came.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.672
Quite honestly,
maybe your boyfriend

14:07.716 --> 14:10.632
doesn't satisfy you
like I satisfy my--

14:10.675 --> 14:13.113
Okay.
- Stop it!

14:13.156 --> 14:14.723
This is disgusting.

14:14.766 --> 14:15.898
This is coming from the guy

14:15.942 --> 14:17.204
with the ----ing ball gag
in his room.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.467
- It was a joke.
- It was a joke?

14:19.510 --> 14:21.295
The teeth marks
in it were too.

14:21.338 --> 14:22.731
Yeah, it was a joke.

14:22.774 --> 14:23.819

right in front of you.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.864
Thank you.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.604
- No problem.
- That looks good.

14:26.648 --> 14:27.823

14:27.867 --> 14:29.216

thing to me

14:29.259 --> 14:30.826
and I promise you guys

14:30.870 --> 14:33.829
I will not let my life take
priority over their lives.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.484
- That's good.
- You really never told us

14:36.527 --> 14:38.225
exactly why you're
on your way home again.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.314
Well, honestly, ever since
you started the renovations,

14:40.357 --> 14:41.706
I'm like a gypsy.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.230
If anybody asks where
my home is right now,

14:43.273 --> 14:45.188
what would I say?
My shore house?

14:45.232 --> 14:47.321
- No, that's fair.
- And also, I'm getting older.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.757
The things that matter
are my family.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.802
It is a temporary place
to live.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.501
Obviously, it's not going
to be my last homestead,

14:53.544 --> 14:55.633
but Dolores and I got divorced

14:55.677 --> 14:57.113
<i>when she was pregnant</i> <i>
with Frankie.</i>

14:57.157 --> 14:58.985
So it's a great opportunity

14:59.028 --> 15:00.943
<i>'cause I've never lived</i> <i>
with both of my kids</i>

15:00.987 --> 15:02.684
at the same time
in the same house.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.512
I'm very thankful to be
living with you guys.

15:04.555 --> 15:07.689
100 percent.
When are you coming back?

15:07.732 --> 15:11.475
I'm not coming anytime soon.
I may extend my lease.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.695
- Oh, why?
- I mean, I like where I live.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.088
I just want to be
alone and chill and--

15:15.131 --> 15:17.699
What's going on
between you and David?

15:17.742 --> 15:24.445
So, you know, we kind
of grew apart a little bit.

15:24.488 --> 15:27.709
A lot. I don't see him much.
He's been asking to see me,

15:27.752 --> 15:30.407
but spending the time
that I have alone,

15:30.451 --> 15:31.669
I wonder what I want
in a relationship.

15:31.713 --> 15:32.888
Cut to the point.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.456
Just tell the kids
what the deal is.

15:35.499 --> 15:36.892
Okay? Tell them.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.589
Unfortunately,
this is the end of the road

15:38.633 --> 15:41.810
for me and David.
- Oh, my gosh.

15:41.853 --> 15:44.552
This is terrible to hear about.

15:44.595 --> 15:47.120
But why?

15:47.163 --> 15:49.905
It's because the lack
of communication.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.560
I feel that he hasn't been
there for me in a lot of ways.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.518
He didn't meet me halfway
on a lot of things.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.085
He didn't even meet me
a little bit.

15:56.129 --> 16:00.220
It's the hardest thing to do
is to part ways with someone

16:00.263 --> 16:04.050
that you still love
and care about very much.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.095
But I had nowhere else
to go with this.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.096
That's understandable.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.011
You did your best
to compromise.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.404
It's very sad.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.188
I loved you and David
as a couple.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.625
Frankie, do you think
that your mom and David

16:14.669 --> 16:17.063
will ever get married?

16:17.106 --> 16:18.412
Honestly, yes.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.414
It's like the way
it ended, it sucks.

16:20.457 --> 16:21.937
I feel really bad about it

16:21.981 --> 16:23.330
because I really like David
as a person.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.635
- I loved him.
- It's very hard.

16:24.679 --> 16:27.508
- I loved David too.
- I feel so bad, Frank.

16:27.551 --> 16:30.163

16:30.206 --> 16:31.512
You know my loyalty is to you.

16:31.555 --> 16:32.817
Right.

16:32.861 --> 16:33.993
And you know your kids'
loyalty is to you.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.777
Do you have a problem
with any of us?

16:35.820 --> 16:37.387
Maintaining
a relationship with him.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.954
It's hard to be there for him

16:38.998 --> 16:41.435
because David has become
very attached to this family.

16:41.478 --> 16:44.960
<i>I never realized how close</i> <i>
the kids would get to David.</i>

16:45.004 --> 16:47.093
Because he wasn't too fond
on getting close with me

you know, as we can all see.

for acknowledging

Yeah, so, guys,
I don't know if you know,

34:07.784 --> 34:09.003
a switch of plans,

34:09.047 --> 34:10.439
we're gonna have
the barbecue tonight

34:10.483 --> 34:13.573
at Jen's house because
I'm staying at Jen's house

34:13.616 --> 34:15.618
because I have
a full house of children,

34:15.662 --> 34:16.924
but I'm still doing
the barbecue.

34:16.967 --> 34:19.013
We're just switching addresses.

34:19.057 --> 34:22.016
Yeah, I'm happy to welcome
all of you guys to the house.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.322
That is very nice.
Thank you.

34:23.365 --> 34:24.932
- Thank you.
- Appreciate that.

34:24.975 --> 34:27.239
- Here's to Louie and Tiki.
- Salut.

34:27.282 --> 34:29.806
Listen, I just want him
to be great to my sister.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.592
As long as she's happy,
takes care of those kids.

34:32.635 --> 34:35.116
- Do the kids like him?
- I think so.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.596
- Yeah?
- I think so.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.772
- Wait, so Tre, where's Louie?
- He's driving down.

34:38.815 --> 34:39.903
- Okay.
- Yeah, I mean--

34:39.947 --> 34:40.904
Is he gonna come
straight here?

34:40.948 --> 34:42.602
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yes.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.125
We're gonna go
to the ladies' room.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.561
I need to pee too.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.563
Dolores!
Stand back up a second.

34:47.607 --> 34:49.652
We're just looking
at your side boob.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.611
Oh, do they ever grow up?

34:51.654 --> 34:53.003
She wants to
kill you right now.

34:53.047 --> 34:54.135
She's still wondering

34:54.179 --> 34:55.615
whether you had sex
with Dolores.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.138
Did you have sex with
Dolores when you were young?

34:57.182 --> 34:58.792
No, never.

34:58.835 --> 35:01.447
When I went home that night,
she woke up at 2:00

35:01.490 --> 35:03.405
and she was standing over me
like the exorcist, right?

35:03.449 --> 35:04.406
Looking up--

35:11.021 --> 35:12.632
I'm coming over here.

35:12.675 --> 35:15.635
Wait, so Teresa is staying
at Jennifer's house?

35:15.678 --> 35:17.071
I guess 'cause she has
a house full of kids.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.291
Is Louie sleeping at
Jennifer's house too though?

35:19.334 --> 35:20.944
- Guess so.
- No, listen, listen,

35:20.988 --> 35:23.164
she has a lot of kids
that have a lot of friends.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.166
It's like a tornado hit it
all the time.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.821
All right, Louie has to be
able to deal with that.

35:27.864 --> 35:30.040
Listen, you know Louie
much better than I do.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.651
And she seems very happy,

35:31.694 --> 35:34.001
Joe and I, obviously,
we're hearing stuff.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.177
Can I check you right now?
And you guys are all gonna

35:36.221 --> 35:39.702
agree that this guy
is charming as sh-- in person.

35:39.746 --> 35:41.574
But we see Teresa's face
when she's with him.

35:41.617 --> 35:44.011
<i>He's good to her,</i> <i>
with her every night and day.</i>

35:44.054 --> 35:45.969
I mean, how do you
question the guy?

35:46.013 --> 35:48.146
He is charming,
he's good-looking.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.756
So is a car salesman.

35:49.799 --> 35:52.541
There's so much crap
coming out about him.

35:52.585 --> 35:55.414
But you know what?
Sometimes,

35:55.457 --> 35:58.504
when there's much smoke,
there's got to be some fire.

35:58.547 --> 36:00.201
You know, that's upsetting.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.203
So just, like, address it,
you know?

36:02.247 --> 36:04.249
- Right.
- I gotta run.

36:04.292 --> 36:05.685
Sorry, it's hot.
- I'm good with the sunscreen.

36:05.728 --> 36:06.686
It is hot, right?

36:09.645 --> 36:11.256
Great, thank you.

36:11.299 --> 36:12.779
Okay, all right. Food.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.215
I'm, like, weak.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.086
Listen, I just want
to relax.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.610
This is the first time

36:17.653 --> 36:20.352
I'm down the shore by myself
since David and I broke up.

36:20.395 --> 36:22.049
So it's just really done?
That's it?

36:22.092 --> 36:24.182
I didn't hear from him again.

36:24.225 --> 36:26.706
- That's ----ed up.
- I haven't told Teresa.

36:28.098 --> 36:29.448
What?

36:29.491 --> 36:32.146
That David and I broke up
like over a week ago.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.756
What, what?

36:33.800 --> 36:36.542
Why didn't you text me
and tell me?

36:36.585 --> 36:39.240
Because it wasn't easy
for me to even talk about

36:39.284 --> 36:40.502
and then the other thing is

36:40.546 --> 36:43.026
I'm taking it very bad, horrible.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.202
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.204
Who's this? Who got tacos?
Traci?

36:46.247 --> 36:47.292
Me. I'm gonna sit
this way though

36:47.335 --> 36:48.815
because
I want my back to the sun.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.643
Wait, what day did you
break up with him?

36:50.686 --> 36:53.254
Was it the day
of Jackie's party?

36:53.298 --> 36:55.474
You were ----ing bananas
that day.

36:55.517 --> 36:58.346
You know she ----ing blew up
at Jackie out of nowhere.

36:58.390 --> 36:59.913
Now, I know you got
a hot temper,

36:59.956 --> 37:02.350
but like, now it makes sense.

37:02.394 --> 37:03.830
But then she ended up
getting mad at me towards

37:03.873 --> 37:06.093
the end and I was like--
- Listen, Jennifer,

37:06.136 --> 37:08.269
I'm sorry that you were hurt,

37:08.313 --> 37:10.445
but you want to know
what really got me?

37:10.489 --> 37:11.707
Why is Jackie coming,

37:11.751 --> 37:13.622
all of a sudden
being friends with you

37:13.666 --> 37:15.537
when you're fighting
with her friends?

37:15.581 --> 37:18.279
Well, I feel like she knows
what I'm going through

37:18.323 --> 37:20.847
and realizes
how cruel this was to me.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.936
You want to know something?
Your friend over here?

37:22.979 --> 37:24.677
You know what she said when
we were leaving her party?

37:24.720 --> 37:26.505
"I don't care,
he shouldn't have

37:26.548 --> 37:28.376
stuck his dick
in somebody else."

37:28.420 --> 37:32.337
- Who said that?
- Jackie. She's a friend?

37:32.380 --> 37:34.556
This is the most disgusting,
vile thing

37:34.600 --> 37:36.558
that anybody could ever say.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.300
Jennifer,
she's ----ing playing you,

37:39.344 --> 37:40.736
don't be a pussy about this.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.869
It's ----ing gross.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.268
Guess what, Jennifer.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.791
Your friend over here,

37:51.834 --> 37:53.532
you know what she said
when we were leaving her party?

37:53.575 --> 37:55.185
"I don't care,
he shouldn't have

37:55.229 --> 37:58.058
stuck his dick
in somebody else."

37:58.101 --> 38:00.800
That is the most
disgusting thing

38:00.843 --> 38:02.497
that anybody could ever say.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.891
That's ----ing gross.

38:04.934 --> 38:06.284
She ----ing said that?

38:06.327 --> 38:08.198
<i>Saying that about</i> <i>
somebody's husband</i>

38:08.242 --> 38:10.244
who actually did
have an affair?

38:10.288 --> 38:12.464
That's just cruel.
Who else heard it?

38:12.507 --> 38:13.900
It's a blur to me.

38:13.943 --> 38:15.293
<i>I thought she was my friend.</i>

38:15.336 --> 38:17.382
Or I thought she wanted
to try to be my friend.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.079
How about that? No?

38:19.122 --> 38:21.516
Listen, at what point did
she start to feel bad for me?

38:21.560 --> 38:22.952
I'm just curious.
I don't know.

38:22.996 --> 38:25.477
Was it right after she said it?

38:25.520 --> 38:26.782
Was it before she said it?

38:26.826 --> 38:31.221
So just open your eyes
a little bit, okay?

38:31.265 --> 38:33.702
Oh, Louie just--there's
so much traffic, I guess,

38:33.746 --> 38:36.314
he won't be at the house.
- Where's Louie?

38:36.357 --> 38:38.359
I just texted him, I said,
"Louie, where are you?"

38:38.403 --> 38:39.795
What did he say?

38:39.839 --> 38:43.103
He says, "Driving down,
had so much work."

38:43.146 --> 38:44.452
- Okay.
- All right.

38:44.496 --> 38:45.888
Whoo, it's hot.
