Where'd you get yours?

00:21.062 --> 00:22.063
Your drawer.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.817
Zuri, I told you to ask
before you take my things.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.944
Okay, then can I borrow
your headphones?

00:28.945 --> 00:29.821
No, you may not.

Cute outfit.

Aw, thanks.
I love my fashion
sense, too.

Man, I've seen someone
fall off a horse.

But I've never seen someone
fall off a step stool

you enjoyed it so much.

Too bad Matteo
wasn't there to see it.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.638
We have got to coax him
out of the cabin.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.098
Perhaps,
we could employ
a bit of skulduggery.

It's the best, right?
Nothing else gives me

You know, Emma,
I won Chattanooga's
Little Miss Fitness pageant

02:25.478 --> 02:27.522
I clinched it
by singing Doe, a Deer

while dead-lifting
125 pounds.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.527
Wow, Destiny,
you are amazing.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.780
That's what I say to myself
in the mirror every morning.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.408
You also do
a daily affirmation?

02:38.992 --> 02:41.119
I had no idea
we had so much in common.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.079
I didn't know
we had so much
in common, either.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.331
Hey, that's another thing
we have in common.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.627
Wait, Destiny,
are you wearing
Emma's necklace?

02:49.961 --> 02:50.962
Yes.

02:51.212 --> 02:52.881
I was looking
all over for that.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.925
And Emma,
you're okay with this?

02:56.467 --> 02:59.554
You freak out on me
when I borrow your stuff,
and I'm your sister.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.055
Well,
she asked.

03:01.055 --> 03:02.140
So?

03:02.473 --> 03:04.976
So, she's considerate.
She thought about
my feelings.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.812
Something you never do.
Come on, Destiny.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.901
I think about your feelings
all the time.

03:13.651 --> 03:17.572
When I borrowed this watch
I thought, "Hey,
Emma's gonna be upset."

03:22.201 --> 03:26.539
Finn, we have discussed
operating motor vehicles
inside the cabin.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.917
Must I remind you
what that speedboat
did to the bath tub?

03:30.209 --> 03:33.254
Dude, this is how
we're going to trick
Matteo into having some fun.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.925
It's a fake ATV
"virtual reality
simulator."

03:37.884 --> 03:39.594
Oh, I see.

03:39.594 --> 03:43.514
We will tell him
he's going on an ATV ride
in virtual reality,

03:43.514 --> 03:45.058
but instead we take him
on a real one.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.852
I will say something
I have never said before,

03:47.852 --> 03:49.103
Finn, brilliant.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.233
Hey, what are you
guys up to?

03:53.233 --> 03:56.444
We came up with a way
for you to have fun from
the safety of the cabin.

03:56.861 --> 03:59.364
Yeah, I programmed
a virtual reality version

03:59.364 --> 04:00.823
of Camp Kikiwaka
for you.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.450
(DOUBTFULLY)
You programmed it?

04:02.992 --> 04:04.827
(WHISPERS)
He's onto us.
Bail, bail.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.289
I programmed it.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.251
Finn picked something out
of his armpit and ate it.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.127
That makes
more sense.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.048
Matteo,

04:18.132 --> 04:19.676
if you put on this
helmet, you can
hop on the simulator,

04:19.676 --> 04:23.221
and Finn can take you
for an ATV ride
around virtual camp.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.598
Well, as long as
I'm back soon.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.725
I have some
virtual reading to do.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.396
All of the intellectual
stimulation, with none
of the paper cuts.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.025
I can't see.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.238
Welcome
to Camp Virtu-waka!

04:41.406 --> 04:44.951
Whoa, not only does
everything look real,

04:44.951 --> 04:48.079
but I swear I can even
smell the algae bloom
from the lake.

04:49.163 --> 04:53.960
Uh, yes, because
that is not just
a virtual reality helmet,

04:54.335 --> 04:56.754
it is a virtual reality
smell-met.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.550
Okay,
let's ride, baby!

05:00.550 --> 05:02.051
And try
to pop a wheelie!

05:02.510 --> 05:05.471
I can't go yet,
there are too many
campers in our way.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.807
Those campers
can't get hurt.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.143
They only exist
in virtual reality.

05:11.185 --> 05:14.897
Yes, but, um,
remember the song
from ATV safety class.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.650

05:33.249 --> 05:34.625
"Camp Virtu-waka?"

05:34.917 --> 05:37.837
I can't believe
you thought I'd fall
for this stupid plan.

05:38.212 --> 05:42.050
In my defense,
I took a pretty nasty fall
off a ten-inch step stool.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.512
Hey, Emma.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.806
To show
how considerate I am,

05:48.806 --> 05:50.183
I wanted
to give you something.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.393
My suitcase?
Thanks?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.229
Oh geez,
this is yours, huh?

05:56.564 --> 05:58.107
Well, inside
your suitcase

05:58.107 --> 05:59.776
is all the stuff
I've borrowed from you.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.611
Thanks for
lending it to me.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.863
I didn't,
but you're welcome.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.908
Look,
I'm trying here.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.410
How about we have
some sister time together?

06:09.660 --> 06:11.120
Let's get some
ice cream?

06:11.412 --> 06:12.872
Zuri, I'm lactose
intolerant.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.123
Since when?

06:15.625 --> 06:17.418
Since my tenth birthday,
when Mom and Dad
got me an ice cream cake,

06:17.418 --> 06:19.045
and I threw up so much
it came out of my nose.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.172
Oh, yeah,
that was awesome.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.425
I mean,
you poor thing.

06:26.260 --> 06:29.138
Hey, Emma, you know,
since we started
hanging out,

06:29.639 --> 06:32.100
you've become like
the big sister
I always wanted.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.310
Aw, that's
so sweet.

06:35.186 --> 06:39.315
So, as a token
of my appreciation,
I got you a little something.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.526
Aw, Destiny,

06:41.526 --> 06:44.612
I hate to have
to break this to you,
but if Emma eats ice cream,

06:44.612 --> 06:47.156
vomit's gonna fly out
of every hole in her face.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.619
That's why I bought her
this dairy-free sorbet.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.163
Thank you, Destiny.
How thoughtful.

06:55.456 --> 06:56.541
Sister power.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.750
Sister power.

06:58.793 --> 06:59.836
Let's go grab
some spoons.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.301
Fine, I'm keeping
the suitcase.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.938
Hey, Ravi,
what's for lunch?

07:18.938 --> 07:21.315
Something
flavorful.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.694
Wait,
where is Matteo?

07:25.236 --> 07:27.280
In the cabin,
being boring.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.074
Any other ideas
to get him out of there.

07:30.658 --> 07:34.328
Actually, there is something
I used to overcome
my phobia of bees.

07:34.328 --> 07:35.872
Why were you
afraid of bees?

07:36.497 --> 07:37.832
They don't sting
unless you bother them.

07:38.207 --> 07:39.625
Oh, not the insect,
the grade.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.796
Not getting an A
is the worst sting of all.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.258
Well, how did you
get over it?

07:48.050 --> 07:49.594
I used the power
of hypnotism.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.345
You mean one
of those talking dummies?

07:51.721 --> 07:53.431
No, that is
ventriloquism

07:53.848 --> 07:55.558
which happens to be
another passion of mine.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.937
But I am talking about
the controlling of
someone else's mind.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.857
That's cool.
But if you can do that,

08:03.107 --> 08:05.443
why don't you hypnotize
a girl into liking you?

08:06.068 --> 08:08.529
Well, the process
involves looking deeply
into my eyes...

08:08.529 --> 08:10.448
Say no more.
I get it.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.579
These flavor packets
Ravi uses are amazing.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.165
It just dissolved
a ten pound hairball
in the drain.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.417
That's great.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.253
Hey, Zuri,
is everything okay?

08:24.712 --> 08:27.089
It's nothing I could talk
to you about, anyway.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.592
It has to do with Emma,
and you're her best friend.

08:30.426 --> 08:31.802
Oh, well...

08:34.514 --> 08:37.433
(WOODCHUCK VOICE) Maybe you
could talk about it with me,

08:37.975 --> 08:39.769
Woody the Woodchuck?

08:44.607 --> 08:46.359
Lou, get that thing
out of my face.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.153
It's creepy
and smells like smoke.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.865
(AS WOODY) Yeah, well,
that's what happens
when someone

08:52.865 --> 08:54.492
leaves you
behind in a fire.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.495
(NORMAL VOICE) Hey now,
Woody, that's unfair.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.955
You know if I knew
you were in the cabin,

08:58.955 --> 09:00.289
I would have tried
to rescue you.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.208
(AS WOODY) Where else
would I have been?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.126
It's not like dead animals
are always going out
for walks!

09:07.797 --> 09:09.966
Should I leave,
so you two can work this out?

09:11.133 --> 09:14.887
Sorry, he's still dealing
with some post-traumatic
stress from the fire.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.183
Yeah, clearly
he's the one with issues.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.395
Zuri, I might be close
with Emma,

09:22.395 --> 09:23.521
but I'm here
for you too.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.398
Tell me what's up.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.275
It's just...

09:27.817 --> 09:30.444
I can't believe that Emma
is spending all her time

09:30.444 --> 09:31.862
with Destiny
instead of me.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.490
It kinda hurts
my feelings.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.034
Oh... Well,

09:37.034 --> 09:39.537
if it's really bothering you,
you should talk about it
with Emma.

09:40.371 --> 09:41.330
No way.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.583
I am not telling Emma
that I'm jealous of her

09:43.583 --> 09:44.959
for hanging out
with a ten-year-old.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.961
And you better
not tell her either.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.839
Okay. I promise
I won't say a word.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.757
And that goes
for Woody, too.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.053
Oh, Zuri, Woody's
a stuffed animal.
He can't talk.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.473
Can you believe
that she thought
you could talk?

10:00.808 --> 10:04.520
Lou, you have got to crack
a window when you're using
those flavor packets.

10:09.358 --> 10:12.361
Okay, in order to put
Matteo under hypnosis,

10:12.361 --> 10:15.406
I will guide him
to a state of
extreme relaxation

10:15.656 --> 10:18.242
then tap a tea cup
with a spoon
exactly three times.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.578
Won't Matteo
know something is up

10:20.578 --> 10:22.455
if we follow him around
holding a tea cup?

10:23.289 --> 10:26.375
He would if I were
simply holding the cup
like a Neanderthal.
