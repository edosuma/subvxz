00:46.681 --> 00:49.916
- Susan, how's it sounding out there?
- You sound great Burt.

00:49.918 --> 00:51.684
Alright.
Check check check.

00:51.686 --> 00:52.985
Loretta!

00:52.987 --> 00:54.787
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

00:54.789 --> 00:57.523
- Am I that hard to find?
- Everything's falling apart.

00:57.525 --> 01:01.961
- Nothing's falling apart Gretchen.
- What about the ice, the music?

01:01.963 --> 01:03.162
The catering truck?

01:03.164 --> 01:06.065
The ice is going in the deer freezer,
Burt is organizing the music,

01:06.067 --> 01:07.567
and Turner is cutting
branches to make

01:07.569 --> 01:09.268
room for the catering Truck.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.770
Look, it's all planned out.

01:10.772 --> 01:13.172
Your grandparents
anniversary will be perfect.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.475
Excuse me.

01:19.647 --> 01:22.815
- Hey mom.
- Hi sweetie.

01:22.817 --> 01:24.417
Aren't those azaleas beautiful?

01:24.419 --> 01:27.553
They are mom, but I thought we were using
cherry blossoms for the centerpieces?

01:27.555 --> 01:30.189
You don't think these azaleas
are pretty?

01:30.191 --> 01:34.026
No I do, it's just, well azaleas
are just so common around here.

01:34.028 --> 01:36.662
- Aren't you a little bored of them?
- No, not really.

01:36.664 --> 01:39.066
I have an idea, we could put the
azaleas by the photo booth.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.535
It's just I had the cherry
blossoms shipped in from Oregan.

01:42.537 --> 01:43.302
Please use them for
the centerpieces.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.704
Okay of course.

01:44.706 --> 01:49.041
- Have you seen Wayne?
- I think he's finishing up with a guest.

01:49.043 --> 01:51.143
Have you told him yet?

01:51.145 --> 01:52.845
- I'm going to.
- Loretta.

01:52.847 --> 01:54.647
I can't wait for him forever.

01:54.649 --> 01:57.550
I've been trying for weeks mom,
he keeps changing the subject.

01:57.552 --> 02:02.221
But this time now it's for sure?
Honey you have to tell him.

02:12.934 --> 02:15.368
Hey Abby.
Good girl Abby.

02:19.674 --> 02:23.275
- Hey Wayne, can you give me a hand?
- Yeah what do I pay you for?

02:23.277 --> 02:25.978
You can always fire me.
Give my job to Abby.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.114
I'm not sure she would
take the job and salary.

02:29.751 --> 02:32.585
Hey, you might wanna schedule
regular maintenance for that gear.

02:32.587 --> 02:34.520
When something breaks
let me know.

02:34.522 --> 02:37.657
- It ain't a crime to think about tomorrow.
- And miss today?

02:38.793 --> 02:40.926
Hey I'm just your employee.

02:40.928 --> 02:44.597
But you own the inn now.
It's a lot of responsibilities.

02:46.134 --> 02:48.801
- You sound like Loretta.
- Smart woman.

02:48.803 --> 02:50.169
Smart man would already
put a ring on her finger.

02:50.171 --> 02:53.072
Yeah, I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

02:53.074 --> 02:54.440
Speak of the angel.

02:57.078 --> 02:58.078
Lori!

03:01.315 --> 03:02.948
You know how much
I miss you today?

03:04.085 --> 03:07.253
- Things go well with the guests?
- It's a great, fish are biting all day.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.321
I hear Gretchen's
party was a blowout.

03:09.323 --> 03:12.858
- It's only 30 guests.
- Now it sounds like plenty to me.

03:14.028 --> 03:15.561
You know what, I was
thinking, this winter

03:15.563 --> 03:17.930
when things slow down we
should refurbish the old barn.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.131
Wayne...

03:19.133 --> 03:21.534
We could redo the wood, put in a bar,
you could use it for events.

03:21.536 --> 03:24.136
We can't avoid talking
about it forever.

03:24.138 --> 03:28.307
- Yeah fine, fine, let's talk about it.
- Well it's a huge opportunity for me.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.709
There aren't opportunities here?

03:29.711 --> 03:32.611
I'd be working for one of the biggest
event planners in the country.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.013
Yeah in Los Angeles.

03:34.015 --> 03:36.649
Loretta we can build the
Sundown into something special.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.784
This is your hometown.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

03:38.786 --> 03:40.219
Of course it does.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.257
You took it.

03:48.463 --> 03:51.064
- I leave next week.
- Okay.

03:53.134 --> 03:54.734
And what does that mean for...

03:54.736 --> 03:57.737
You have no idea how hard
this decision was for me.

03:57.739 --> 03:58.739
No.

04:00.141 --> 04:02.675
If I don't do this...

04:02.677 --> 04:04.844
...I'll always wonder
whether I'm good enough.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.013
Yeah fine.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.783
You do whatever you got to.

04:10.785 --> 04:11.785
I'm sorry Wayne.

04:44.018 --> 04:46.218
- Good morning Ms. Bennett.
- Good morning.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.523
- Feeling okay?
- I'm fine.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.659
If you're getting sick
I could always do the...

04:53.661 --> 04:55.527
I don't get sick.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.764
Now, what do we
have for tomorrow?

04:58.766 --> 05:02.167
Zack Carroway's birthday party.
Beverly Hills, invitation only.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.403
Bouncy castle arrives at
8 am followed by cake.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.139
- Loretta.
- Yes Ms. Bennett.

05:07.141 --> 05:10.476
This isn't a presidential inauguration,
it's an eight year olds birthday party.

05:10.478 --> 05:13.479
Which we are only doing
so Zack's mommy and daddy

05:13.481 --> 05:15.514
will hire us for
the Richmond Ball.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.983
- I just like to be prepared.
- And that is wonderful.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.520
But remember, no plan survives
contact with the enemy.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.426
Still, I appreciate
your hard work.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.596
Especially now that
Dee Dee has retired.

05:30.598 --> 05:33.599
Right, have you chosen anyone
to be the new lead planner?

05:33.601 --> 05:36.301
I don't know.
You have someone in mind?

05:42.643 --> 05:44.343
Hello.

05:44.345 --> 05:47.379
Hi Lori, I hope I'm
not interrupting anything.

05:47.381 --> 05:50.782
No no, I'm just finishing dinner.
Pretty casual.

05:50.784 --> 05:55.120
- So, how is the City of Angels?
- Yeah, everything's great.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.756
Well you know, the Spring
Festival's coming up.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.691
I sure wish you'd
come home to visit.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.693
As soon as things
slow down I promise.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.330
- I know honey, you work so hard.
- Well I think it's finally paying off.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.599
I think Ms. Bennett's
promoting me to lead planner.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.536
Well that's great!
You deserve it.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.238
I mean, I know they miss
you here at the Sundown.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.441
- How is everything over there?
- Well you could call and ask for yourself.

06:16.443 --> 06:19.645
- I tried calling.
- You tried two years ago.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.648
- Well Wayne doesn't wanna talk.
- Well maybe he'll surprise you.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.284
Yeah maybe.
Look, I gotta run, I love you mom.

06:25.286 --> 06:26.451
I love you too honey.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.683
I'm on my way, they took
forever with your dry cleaning.

06:44.605 --> 06:45.971
Ms. Bennett are you okay?

06:45.973 --> 06:48.006
I might be coming
down with something.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.741
If you don't feel
up to making the party...

06:49.743 --> 06:51.109
...I could totally
handle it on my own.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.578
Loretta you sure?

06:52.580 --> 06:55.480
Absolutely, it's an eight year olds
birthday party. How bad could it be?

06:55.482 --> 06:59.117
- I will remember this.
- Don't worry, I have it all under control.

07:01.889 --> 07:02.889
Okay.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.301
There's no need to rush, there's
plenty of cake for everyone.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.669
There ya go.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.271
Could you move the
gifts inside please?

07:19.273 --> 07:20.273
Thank you.

07:21.141 --> 07:25.010
This is Adelay and Adelay gets
the special cake with no nuts.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.351
There ya go.

07:37.091 --> 07:40.025
No, the bouncy house!

07:40.894 --> 07:42.861
Is anybody in here?

07:58.078 --> 08:00.212
Oh thank god.

08:05.019 --> 08:07.387
- Thank you.
- Of course.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.015
So sorry, head in the clouds.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.251
Hold on a second.
You might be looking for this.

08:40.254 --> 08:42.386
My planner.
Thank you.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.823
Hope you don't mind.
I took a peak inside.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.592
- Are you always so thorough?
- Afraid so.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.194
It's very impressive.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.430
- I'm Paul Perenti.
- Perenti like the law firm?

08:51.432 --> 08:53.398
- You've heard of us?
- Yeah, Adelay's your dau...

08:53.400 --> 08:57.235
Adelay's my niece, and this is
my fiance Michelle Wellerson.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.870
The party is amazing.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.405
And the way that you
fixed the bouncy castle.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.907
Well, thank my dad.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.810
He had me fixing engines soon
as I could lift a wrench.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.745
- Tomboy huh?
- Yeah big time.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.347
As a kid I practically
lived in the woods.

09:08.349 --> 09:10.849
- You grew up in the woods?
- Not literally.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.784
This is gonna be perfect.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.320
We have to go but we would love
to discuss an event with you.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.555
Can you stop by my
office tomorrow?

09:16.557 --> 09:18.490
Yeah, I think I have some time.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.826
Great, I'll have the garage
reserve a space for Amy Bennett.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.622
Awesome meeting you, and look
forward to seeing you tomorrow.

09:35.542 --> 09:38.710
Excuse me madam,
I'm here to offer you my eyes.

09:38.712 --> 09:42.180
Because after seeing you,
I won't be needing them again.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.983
- Hey Howard.
- Hey honey, I'm sorry I'm late.

09:44.985 --> 09:48.153
- Audition went well?
- Well, you just saw it so...

09:48.155 --> 09:48.987
...what'd you think?

09:48.989 --> 09:51.223
- Oh stirring.
- Good.

09:51.225 --> 09:53.425
It was for a soap, so
stirring was the goal.

09:53.427 --> 09:54.559
Go over the menu?

09:54.561 --> 09:57.295
- Yeah, they're still serving brunch.
- Great, I love brunch.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.965
Is brunch so popular in LA because
no one's up in time for breakfast?

09:59.967 --> 10:03.235
And mimosa's are fantastic.

10:03.237 --> 10:04.970
Speaking of fantastic
I'm loving this suit.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.472
It's my bosses.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.841
Why are you wearing
your bosses clothes?

10:09.843 --> 10:12.310
Long story. Have you heard
of Paul Perenti?

10:12.312 --> 10:13.745
I don't think so.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.080
Well he's one of the most
powerful lawyers in the city.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.248
Go on.

10:16.250 --> 10:19.951
He mistook me for my boss today
and I didn't correct him.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.219
Well look at you.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.990
He wants me, or Amy Bennett rather
to come to his office tomorrow.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.025
- You have to go.
- Howard...

10:27.027 --> 10:30.829
Babe, this is why people come to LA.
Okay, to become something we're not.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.497
I mean this could
be your big break.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.232
Look, I'm seeing Amy
tomorrow morning anyway.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.501
I'll talk to her about it then
and then we can go together.

10:36.503 --> 10:39.704
Okay fine, but I'm telling ya,
I don't think that's the way...

10:39.706 --> 10:41.206
Crepes florentine.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.352
Loretta!

10:54.488 --> 10:58.757
Congratulations on the party!
Zack's parents were thrilled.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.526
They just called to hire us
for the Richmond Ball.

11:01.528 --> 11:02.994
That's wonderful.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.031
What's this I hear about
you fixing a bouncy castle?

11:06.033 --> 11:08.300
It was nothing.
Actually, funny story.

11:08.302 --> 11:09.434
I met someone at the party...

11:09.436 --> 11:13.438
Wait, before we talk about the party,
I have a surprise for you.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.807
You know I've been looking
for a new lead planner.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.975
Yeah.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.711
Well, Elizabeth, can you
come in here please?

11:19.713 --> 11:20.713
Sure.

11:22.082 --> 11:25.083
Elizabeth Nash,
meet Loretta Johnson.

11:25.085 --> 11:28.386
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.589
Elizabeth is our
new lead planner.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.358
Amy tells me you're great.

11:33.360 --> 11:37.629
Elizabeth has tons of experience.
You're gonna learn a lot from her.

11:37.631 --> 11:40.432
So what were you saying about
the party? You met someone?

11:42.102 --> 11:43.268
It's not important.

11:44.571 --> 11:45.770
Okay.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.072
I have some swatches
I wanna show you.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.175
- Okay, it was great meeting you.
- Yeah.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.303
Hi this is Amy Bennet,
I just wanted to confirm...

11:59.338 --> 12:01.620
...my appointment with
Mr. Perenti this afternoon.

12:02.990 --> 12:03.990
Thank you.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.739
Sorry for the wait Ms. Bennett.

12:20.741 --> 12:21.741
Please, come on in.

12:22.976 --> 12:26.478
- How's your day going?
- Great, great, and you?

12:26.480 --> 12:28.613
Yeah fine, thank you.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.082
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.052
- Hi Amy.
- Hello.

12:34.054 --> 12:39.190
Let me tell you first off Amy, even
though I'm a lawyer, I hate liars.

12:39.192 --> 12:43.828
- Mr. Perenti, there's actually...
- So I apologize for lying to you.

12:44.998 --> 12:48.767
I told you Michelle was my fiance
and technically we're not engaged.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.368
I'm not sure I understand.

12:50.370 --> 12:54.339
My father, Arthur,
he's a bit old fashioned.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.608
Paul hasn't received his
blessing to marry me yet.

12:56.610 --> 13:00.445
- That's where you come in.
- You want me to ask him for you?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.982
No, no, nothing like that.
It's just...

13:03.884 --> 13:05.917
...he's very hard to impress.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.887
Well if Paul Perenti doesn't
impress him I'm not sure who could...

13:08.889 --> 13:11.523
My dad is not impressed
by stuff like this.

13:11.525 --> 13:15.260
He's an outdoorsman
and Paul is...

13:15.262 --> 13:16.262
Not.

13:18.298 --> 13:22.601
Wait, Michelle Wellerson, your father
is Arthur Wellerson the billionaire?

13:22.603 --> 13:24.436
Well he prefers Arthur Wellerson
the philanthropist, yes.

13:24.438 --> 13:27.339
Arthur and I haven't
exactly hit it off.

13:27.341 --> 13:30.008
And I think it's because we're
doing things that I like.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.978
So I would like to plan
a, what'd you call it?

13:32.980 --> 13:34.946
- A retreat?
- A retreat is fine honey yes.

13:34.948 --> 13:38.383
Yes, a weekend outdoors,
with hiking, and fishing,

13:38.385 --> 13:39.884
and get him in a
really great mood.

13:39.886 --> 13:43.188
And if you can make Paul look
more comfortable, all the better.

13:43.190 --> 13:47.359
- He's very hard to impress.
- Yeah you mentioned that.

13:47.361 --> 13:52.097
Most LA event planners spend
even less time outdoors than I do.

13:52.099 --> 13:55.133
But we were blown away
with Zack's party.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.569
And when you mentioned that
you grew up in the woods?

13:57.571 --> 14:00.105
We thought that
you might be perfect.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.040
Okay so, just for my own...

14:04.211 --> 14:06.578
You want me to plan a retreat

14:06.580 --> 14:08.647
to make Paul look
like an outdoorsman

14:08.649 --> 14:11.750
so that your father will give him
his blessing to marry you?

14:13.520 --> 14:16.354
It sounds crazy when
you say it, but yeah.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.624
- Well tell her about the wedding.
- Right, the wedding.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.027
Now we haven't chosen a
firm to plan our wedding,

14:22.029 --> 14:25.063
if you can do this, I don't
see why we can't hire you.

14:25.065 --> 14:28.500
- To plan the Wellerson Perenti wedding.
- Our wedding, yes.

14:28.502 --> 14:31.069
That will be one of the biggest
wedding's of the season.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.339
Yeah you flatter us, but we do
expect it to be a pretty good party.

14:34.341 --> 14:37.342
So, can you please help us out?

14:41.882 --> 14:45.684
There's something I have to tell...
Sorry, sorry.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.891
Everything okay Amy?

14:52.893 --> 14:58.029
Yeah, I have to tell you...
I can't wait to get started.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.998
- Fantastic!
- Thank you so much.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.633
You have no idea what
this means to us.

15:02.636 --> 15:03.636
Well great.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.639
What have I done?

15:07.641 --> 15:09.374
You told a white lie,
it's not that big a deal.

15:09.376 --> 15:13.044
I pretended to be my boss to get
work from a high powered attorney.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.813
He could sue me for fraud.

15:14.815 --> 15:17.982
Okay fine.
A gray lie.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.451
Oh my god.

15:19.453 --> 15:22.487
You can't forget these alright.
You're gonna need your energy.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.725
- Where do you keep your heels?
- Back of the closet.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.361
Don't think of it as lying okay?

15:30.363 --> 15:33.298
Think of it as saving
your boss a lot of work.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.717
Well if I pull this off
Ms. Bennett will get to plan...

15:35.718 --> 15:36.935
...one of the biggest weddings
of the year.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.137
You see, it's a win win.

15:39.139 --> 15:42.841
And this can just be a funny story
we tell the company Christmas parties.

15:42.843 --> 15:44.642
That's my girl.
Alright, try these.

15:44.644 --> 15:47.479
It's a hiking lodge Howard.
I can't wear high heels.

15:47.481 --> 15:49.681
- Honey, see you're thinking
like Loretta Johnson though.

15:49.683 --> 15:52.417
Okay you need to start
thinking like Amy Bennett.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.819
Hey what if I came with you?

15:54.821 --> 15:56.755
I could be Amy's assistant.

15:56.757 --> 15:59.190
I don't think we should stack anymore
lies onto this than we have to.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.426
Look, I gotta shoot in Memphis
this weekend anyway okay.

16:01.428 --> 16:04.829
And it's been six months. I gotta
see your hometown at some point.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.731
There's not much to see.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.701
Well if it produced a woman like you,
I'm sure it's wonderful.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.364
You always did love azaleas.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.169
Loretta!
Oh my goodness!

16:44.171 --> 16:45.737
Hi!

16:45.739 --> 16:47.438
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming home?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.440
Are you here for
the spring festival?

16:49.442 --> 16:50.542
Not exactly.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.014
Yeah.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.551
- And I have to call you Amy?
- Only in front of Paul and Arthur.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.888
Are you sure you just
can't tell them the truth?

17:02.890 --> 17:05.857
If I tell the truth now they'll
call my boss and I'll get fired.

17:08.095 --> 17:11.262
- Think Wayne will go for it?
- I'm not sure he's gonna have a choice.

17:11.265 --> 17:13.464
- What do you mean?
- Well, don't tell him I said this,

17:13.467 --> 17:16.268
but since you've been gone,
Sundown's not doing so well.

17:16.270 --> 17:17.502
What?

17:17.503 --> 17:20.105
Well Wayne, he's great with the
outdoors stuff but you know Wayne.

17:20.107 --> 17:23.175
He's just not organized enough
to keep up with the events.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.277
No, you two were a great team.

17:25.279 --> 17:28.480
- Do you still help out over there?
- No, not so much.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.282
I think Wayne's afraid that
he can't afford to pay me.

17:30.284 --> 17:32.884
I had not idea the inn
was in this much trouble.

17:32.886 --> 17:36.087
Honey, it's not your fault.
What could you do?

17:36.089 --> 17:37.823
You're out there living in LA.

18:03.050 --> 18:04.050
Hello Wayne.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.353
You shouldn't be
wearing high heels.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.288
Could stick in the mud
and twist an ankle.

18:11.825 --> 18:12.924
Good to see you too.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.460
And you Abby!

18:19.666 --> 18:22.400
- Trouble with the engine?
- Nothing I can't handle.

18:22.402 --> 18:26.571
- If you want, I could take a look at it.
- What are you doing here Loretta?

18:26.573 --> 18:27.973
I have some work for you.

18:29.209 --> 18:32.377
- Feel free to call our booking line.
- You mean your cellphone?

18:32.379 --> 18:35.914
- It's a small operation.
- You never answer when I call.

18:35.916 --> 18:36.916
Can you blame me?

18:38.018 --> 18:41.453
Two clients, three days,
deep pockets.

18:41.455 --> 18:44.956
You have been in LA too long if
you think I care about deep pockets.

18:49.530 --> 18:52.297
- They already gave me the deposit.
- Why did they give it to you for?

18:52.299 --> 18:54.566
- You don't work here.
- I'm their event planner.

18:56.069 --> 18:58.436
Actually that's complicated.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.506
- Complicated how?
- Well they think I'm my boss.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.077
So all this getup is
some sort of disguise?

19:06.079 --> 19:08.847
And all you'd have to do
is call me Amy.

19:08.849 --> 19:12.984
I am not interested.
Safe travels Loretta.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.453
I'm glad you found yourself
out there on the coast.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.855
How's the inn doing Wayne?

19:19.226 --> 19:21.560
What is that supposed to mean?

19:21.562 --> 19:24.863
Please.
Okay it's three days.

19:24.865 --> 19:27.766
You could use the money to
finally refurbish the old barn.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.770
I'm sorry,
but we are all booked up.

19:32.873 --> 19:34.205
Have a safe trip home.

19:37.144 --> 19:38.543
It was good to see you Wayne.

19:40.681 --> 19:41.681
I mean it.

20:08.575 --> 20:12.110
That barn is long past due
for some renovations.

20:12.112 --> 20:14.179
Sure is.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.648
I don't see why we couldn't fit in
a couple more guests.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.417
Great, I already told them yes.
They'll be here Friday.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.872
So what'd you tell your boss?

20:40.874 --> 20:43.341
I was going home
for a quick vacation.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.442
And she believed that?

20:47.347 --> 20:50.515
- I should visit more.
- That's fine.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.597
We'll see you every time
you pretend to be your boss.

20:54.421 --> 20:57.022
Obviously my clients will stay
in the main house.

20:57.024 --> 20:59.891
- Really?
- Yeah for what they're paying?

20:59.893 --> 21:04.129
Fine, we have the Millers but I guess
they can stay in one of the cottages.

21:04.131 --> 21:07.332
And I told my mom we'd hire
her back on for the weekend.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.200
And here I thought
I owned this place.

21:09.202 --> 21:11.703
Well we need her help.
It can come out of my cut.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.474
When was the last
time you dusted?

21:16.476 --> 21:20.979
- I leave the windows open on Sundays.
- Yeah that's not how dust works.

21:20.981 --> 21:24.149
Fine, we'll...
we'll do some dusting too.

21:31.925 --> 21:34.325
And now you don't
like my coffee.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.929
Well, these guys drink French
press coffee in an actual French cafe.

21:37.931 --> 21:40.432
They're not gonna drink
Doug's Mellow Brew Mud.

21:40.434 --> 21:43.968
Well that's a shame 'cause Doug
makes a mean cup of coffee.

21:46.273 --> 21:48.306
What is all this?

21:48.308 --> 21:50.175
I'm working on the itinerary
for the weekend.

21:50.177 --> 21:52.444
- An itinerary?
- Yeah a schedule.

21:52.446 --> 21:55.580
Yeah I know what an itinerary is,
why do we need one?

21:55.582 --> 21:59.551
Well, there's a lot riding on this weekend.
Not just for me but for Paul too.

21:59.553 --> 22:03.288
You mentioned that Paul's gonna
ask this billionaire Andrew...

22:03.290 --> 22:05.804
- Arthur.
- Paul is gonna ask Arthur...

22:05.826 --> 22:08.893
...if he can marry his daughter
and he wants to do it out here?

22:08.895 --> 22:10.895
Arthur's an outdoorsman.

22:10.897 --> 22:13.398
Paul wants to show that he's
capable in the outdoors.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.400
- But he's not.
- That' why we need a plan.

22:15.402 --> 22:19.003
We need to put Paul in positions
that make him look comfortable.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.172
Alright.

22:21.174 --> 22:24.709
You might be the event wizard, but
out in the woods, that is my domain.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.679
I have never used an itinerary
and I'm not gonna start now.

22:27.681 --> 22:29.180
I need to make a shopping list.

22:29.182 --> 22:31.649
Do you have any pens or are
those not part of your domain?

22:31.651 --> 22:34.720
- Drawer under the telephone.
- Thank you.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.242
- No stamps.
- What?

22:57.244 --> 22:58.409
You got a passport?

23:00.013 --> 23:02.614
Once you left I thought
it would be a good idea.

23:02.616 --> 23:04.749
So you would leave
Saint Francisville?

23:04.751 --> 23:07.852
- It's just a passport.
- So that's a no.

23:07.854 --> 23:10.889
You know, maybe I don't see much
of a reason to go anyplace else.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.590
Well you must of thought about it.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.593
Didn't you say we've
got some work to do?

23:18.465 --> 23:20.999
Let's take a look at that truck engine
while we still have daylight.

23:21.001 --> 23:23.868
- I told you I could handle that.
- Wayne, are you still insecure...

23:23.870 --> 23:25.937
...about my superior
mechanic skills?

23:31.480 --> 23:35.649
- Look just, don't get electrocuted.
- Do you know nothing about engines?

23:35.651 --> 23:38.585
Honestly I just hope for the best.
It works most of the time.

23:38.587 --> 23:42.022
Well maybe if you focused
on the details a little more...

23:42.024 --> 23:45.726
...stuff would work all the time.
Want me to start it for you?

24:03.312 --> 24:04.312
Hey sounds good.

24:14.123 --> 24:16.323
What do you say we take
it for a test drive?

24:16.325 --> 24:18.992
No, no, I need to wash up
before Turner and my mom get here.

24:18.994 --> 24:23.998
- Come on Lori, quick spin.
- Fine.

24:53.395 --> 24:57.597
Well it seems to be working,
so if I could just get back to the inn...

24:57.599 --> 25:01.301
- What are you doing?
- You don't ever just waste 15 minutes?

25:02.805 --> 25:04.538
Look at where you are.

25:04.540 --> 25:07.841
The sky.
These trees, this town.

25:07.843 --> 25:10.610
Saint Francisville is in my
blood, you don't feel that?

25:21.456 --> 25:22.838
We should get back.

25:26.428 --> 25:27.561
Yeah sure, okay.

25:41.376 --> 25:45.645
- So there we were lost, hungry.
- Tired.

25:45.647 --> 25:46.647
Dog tired.

25:48.050 --> 25:50.350
And Wayne wants to call Loretta.

25:50.352 --> 25:55.322
I have had to wake up Loretta.
That is not a decision you make lightly.

25:56.058 --> 25:59.359
So we're arguing, and who should
appear but Loretta herself.

25:59.361 --> 26:01.628
You two, talk about a sad sight.

26:01.630 --> 26:04.331
Wayne says, "Honey,
how did you find us?"

26:04.333 --> 26:07.033
And she says "Well you two
are making so much racket

26:07.035 --> 26:09.069
"I heard you clear from the tree line".

26:10.405 --> 26:13.740
So, Wayne says,
"Honey, you said you wanted

26:13.742 --> 26:15.609
"wild violets for your party.

26:15.611 --> 26:17.644
"And if it takes me all night
I'm gonna get you some".

26:17.646 --> 26:21.548
And Loretta says,
"Well Wayne, that's very sweet

26:21.550 --> 26:23.783
"but when I said
I wanted wild violets

26:23.785 --> 26:27.921
"I meant I wanted you to go in
my mom's store "and pick some up".

26:31.827 --> 26:36.363
Loretta, we're lost without you.
It's great to have you back.

26:38.166 --> 26:42.168
Oh, Turner.
I'm not back back.

26:42.170 --> 26:44.304
- What do you mean?
- I'm only here for work.

26:44.306 --> 26:46.139
I go back to Los
Angeles next week.

26:52.748 --> 26:53.748
Hey Turner.

26:54.383 --> 26:56.249
Hey, staying with your mom?

26:57.252 --> 26:58.652
My old room.

26:58.654 --> 27:02.189
Coming back home can be
one heck of a thing.

27:03.558 --> 27:05.158
- Everything good in LA?
- Yeah.

27:05.160 --> 27:08.561
Yeah I mean,
my job's a little crazy,

27:09.431 --> 27:12.065
but I'm seeing someone
so that's nice.

27:12.067 --> 27:13.067
Really?

27:14.569 --> 27:16.836
- Have you told Wayne?
- Well is hasn't come up.

27:18.440 --> 27:19.606
Wonder why that is?

27:53.241 --> 27:54.808
I need a hammer and nails.

27:55.744 --> 27:58.611
- Do I wanna know?
- The signs crooked.

27:58.613 --> 27:59.746
No.

27:59.748 --> 28:01.448
Wayne, it's hanging
from a piece of twine.

28:01.450 --> 28:04.284
Exactly. The first thing
you see you go okay...

28:04.286 --> 28:07.053
...at the Sundown Lodge
I don't need to be perfect.

28:07.055 --> 28:08.855
Paul and Arthur are
gonna be here any minute.

28:08.857 --> 28:10.991
I don't have time to argue
with you about this.

28:13.762 --> 28:16.830
Check the barn, there should
be some nails in the toolbox.

28:19.167 --> 28:21.468
- Thank you.
- Put your shoes on.

28:57.706 --> 28:59.672
Hey you find anything?

29:01.610 --> 29:04.411
- What?
- You said you were looking for nails.

29:04.413 --> 29:08.181
- Yeah yeah, I found some.
- Well that's gonna have to wait.

29:08.183 --> 29:09.949
Your guests have
arrived Ms. Bennett.

29:12.254 --> 29:13.254
Okay.

29:17.392 --> 29:19.392
Hello there.

29:19.394 --> 29:22.228
- Mr. Wellerson?
- Guilty.

29:22.230 --> 29:24.597
You must be Amy Bennett.

29:24.599 --> 29:28.668
- This is Wayne Hendricks, he owns the inn.
- Great to meet you Wayne.

29:28.670 --> 29:31.271
Looks like you've got a beautiful
piece of property here.

29:31.273 --> 29:34.174
- Thank you Arthur.
- And I'm sorry we're late.

29:34.176 --> 29:35.992
- I wasn't driving.
- What's that?

29:36.045 --> 29:38.211
- Nothing Paul.
- Okay.

29:38.213 --> 29:41.481
Mrs. Johnson, could you show
Mr. Wellerson to his room?

29:41.483 --> 29:45.418
Of course Ms. Bennett.
It's right this way.

29:45.420 --> 29:48.288
No no, I could not let you do that.

29:48.290 --> 29:49.290
Lead the way.

29:51.960 --> 29:56.329
- Mr. Perenti, so glad you're here.
- Glad to be here Amy.

29:56.331 --> 29:57.764
You have a...

29:59.234 --> 30:00.867
Oops, I must have missed one.

30:00.869 --> 30:02.736
- I'm Paul.
- Wayne.

30:04.106 --> 30:06.773
- Are those new boots?
- Yup.

30:06.775 --> 30:08.775
Guy at the store said
they were top of the line.

30:08.777 --> 30:12.145
Well new boots can blister your feet.
I'll find you some old ones.

30:12.147 --> 30:15.181
Thanks. Well I just want you
to know I'm a little nervous.

30:15.183 --> 30:17.650
After this weekend Arthur goes
to Tanzania for two months.

30:17.652 --> 30:19.152
This is my last
chance for a while.

30:19.154 --> 30:21.855
Don't worry, we're gonna show
Arthur the time of his life.

30:26.361 --> 30:27.361
Was the journey okay?

30:30.499 --> 30:33.566
So we're supposed to make that guy
look like an outdoorsman?

30:33.568 --> 30:35.835
He looks like a mannequin
in a hiking catalog.

30:35.837 --> 30:37.670
Please, don't embarrass him.

30:37.672 --> 30:40.140
I'm sure he'll do
plenty well of that on his own.

30:41.743 --> 30:44.444
Alright, I'll see you outside Amy.

30:59.695 --> 31:02.814
I can't help but notice you've had
your eyes up in the trees.

31:02.831 --> 31:05.866
- Yeah there's a bird I'm looking for.
- Which one?

31:05.868 --> 31:09.836
- You ever hear of a pileated woodpecker?
- The same one as Woody Woodpecker?

31:09.838 --> 31:11.238
Very good.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.773
Yeah I hear you got 'em down here.

31:12.775 --> 31:14.941
Well not real active
this time of year,

31:14.943 --> 31:17.678
but, one morning we can make
a mission of finding one.

31:20.182 --> 31:23.051
- Were the boots okay Mr. Perenti?
- It was fine.

31:24.286 --> 31:25.952
How much further?

31:28.590 --> 31:30.957
- Here.
- What?

31:30.959 --> 31:33.319
- Trade packs with me, mines lighter.
- No really, I'm fine.

31:34.797 --> 31:36.997
The hike's at least
another couple miles.

31:38.300 --> 31:40.033
Can we switch back
once I catch my breath?

31:40.035 --> 31:41.836
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

31:49.044 --> 31:50.343
Come on now.

32:01.423 --> 32:04.491
What, are you lagging behind already
Paul? We're just getting started.

32:04.493 --> 32:06.927
- Oh no, Mr. Perenti came
back for me when I fell behind.

32:06.929 --> 32:08.361
He's like a gazelle.

32:08.363 --> 32:10.263
Arthur and I were just
discussing the route.

32:10.265 --> 32:13.133
- Aren't we taking the Gullawack?
- No Gullawack's barely a hike.

32:13.135 --> 32:16.336
Well as I said in my itinerary, the
Gullawack's a good warmup for the hike.

32:16.338 --> 32:18.972
The Gullawack isn't gonna push
a gazelle like Paul.

32:18.974 --> 32:19.974
Right Paul?

32:22.377 --> 32:24.144
How ya feeling Arthur?

32:24.146 --> 32:25.712
Hey, fresh as a daisy.

32:25.714 --> 32:28.081
What do you say
we try a real hike?

32:28.083 --> 32:29.950
No trails, see where
the trees lead us.

32:29.952 --> 32:32.953
See, that sounds like
an adventure to me.

32:32.955 --> 32:35.489
All settled then.
Let's go exploring.

32:55.110 --> 32:58.111
- Can we take a break?
- The gazelle wearing out?

32:58.113 --> 33:01.081
No, no, it's me.
I have weak ankles.

33:05.687 --> 33:07.989
Great.
Come on Paul.

33:10.359 --> 33:15.028
- So did you grow up around here Amy?
- What, why do you ask?

33:15.030 --> 33:17.430
You seem to know your way
around pretty well.

33:19.268 --> 33:20.534
I brought a lot of clients.

33:20.536 --> 33:21.601
You sure you didn't
grow up around here

33:21.603 --> 33:26.006
because I had an ex-girlfriend
and you are her spitting image.

33:26.008 --> 33:29.609
- Must have one of those faces.
- Well that must be it.

33:29.611 --> 33:32.245
Well, if the lady's
ankles have recovered,

33:32.247 --> 33:33.713
we should be heading home soon.

33:46.562 --> 33:50.730
- Hey, how was the hike?
- Paul barely made it, the poor thing.

33:51.600 --> 33:54.267
Well I'm glad I made extra.
There'll be some hungry boys.

33:54.269 --> 33:56.570
- What'd you make?
- Spam sausage.

33:56.572 --> 33:57.771
Mom you didn't.

33:57.773 --> 34:00.907
Well we always used to serve
spam sausage on the first night.

34:00.909 --> 34:03.343
I don't want Paul to look
squeamish in front of Arthur.

34:04.413 --> 34:05.979
Well he'll just have to make do.

34:07.416 --> 34:09.748
Okay don't lie,
just don't get specific.

34:13.889 --> 34:14.889
Oh boy.

34:18.327 --> 34:20.726
- Hello?
- Hey Amy, it's Michelle.

34:20.728 --> 34:23.929
- Hey Ms. Wellerson.
- Soon to be Mrs. Perenti I hope.

34:23.931 --> 34:27.333
Sure, Arthur and Paul
are really hitting it off.

34:27.335 --> 34:29.603
Oh god, that's such a relief.

34:29.605 --> 34:32.038
My father can be
very hard to impress.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.742
I better head back inside.
We're about to sit down for dinner.

34:35.744 --> 34:40.213
Amy, please. I know this
whole thing can seem antiquated,

34:40.215 --> 34:44.885
but promise me you will
get Paul my father's blessing.

34:44.887 --> 34:45.887
I promise.

34:47.356 --> 34:48.788
Thank you.

34:48.790 --> 34:50.223
I'll talk to you soon.

34:51.693 --> 34:54.092
Well it sounds like Amy Bennett
has everything under control.

34:56.364 --> 34:57.365
Yeah.

35:02.337 --> 35:03.570
Thank you Susan.

35:03.572 --> 35:06.306
Sorry, still work hours
on the west coast.

35:06.308 --> 35:08.608
What?!
They work in LA?

35:08.610 --> 35:11.077
Some of us actually
work pretty hard Arthur.

35:11.079 --> 35:14.080
I know you do Paul.
Just kidding around.

35:15.317 --> 35:19.653
- This sausage smells great.
- Thank you, it's old recipe.

35:19.655 --> 35:21.655
While we have a moment,

35:21.657 --> 35:25.258
I thought we could go through the
itinerary for the next couple of days.

35:28.297 --> 35:33.366
Well, this looks, very detailed.

35:33.368 --> 35:35.602
I think what Amy wants is for us

35:35.604 --> 35:37.704
to get the most out
of our time here.

35:37.706 --> 35:39.306
What do you say we
play things by ear?

35:39.308 --> 35:41.441
I need to narrow things down.

35:41.443 --> 35:43.610
Now there's a man
after my own heart.

35:48.750 --> 35:52.018
You know what, I'll look
over this later on alright?

35:52.020 --> 35:54.454
There's nothing wrong
with having a few ideas.

36:08.103 --> 36:11.638
- Sure I can't help with those dishes?
- Please, you're our guest.

36:13.241 --> 36:15.943
Alright.
See y'all tomorrow.

36:17.913 --> 36:20.880
- Goodnight Arthur.
- Goodnight.

36:24.486 --> 36:27.454
Hey careful, those are antiques.

36:27.456 --> 36:30.123
Come on, I called
you Amy all night,

36:30.125 --> 36:33.493
I took your clients out for a great
hike, what more do you want?

36:33.495 --> 36:35.462
You've been trying to humiliate
Mr. Perenti since he got here.

36:35.464 --> 36:39.099
- I am not trying to humiliate Paul!
- Keep your voice down.

36:39.101 --> 36:41.634
If this is how you treat guests
no wonder the inn is in...

36:42.270 --> 36:46.239
- No wonder the inn is what?
- Don't worry about it.

36:46.241 --> 36:49.175
You don't worry about anything
right? Just play it by ear.

36:49.177 --> 36:51.911
Even if Paul gets Arthur's
blessing, then what?

36:51.913 --> 36:54.481
He spends the rest of his life
pretending to be someone he's not?

36:54.483 --> 36:55.849
Why does that sound familiar?

37:13.502 --> 37:15.535
Loretta, I'm sorry.

37:17.572 --> 37:21.374
My dad told me you never see more
stars than in a Saint Francisville sky.

37:24.046 --> 37:27.213
That's kinda hard to argue
on a night like this.

37:27.215 --> 37:30.804
But how would he know, he never left
Saint Francisville his entire life.

37:33.455 --> 37:35.355
That last summer I was here,

37:36.591 --> 37:37.957
I didn't wanna live my whole life

37:37.959 --> 37:40.460
and think I'd missed my chance
to see the world.

37:48.537 --> 37:50.136
Don't stay out here too long.

37:51.373 --> 37:52.572
We got a big day tomorrow.

38:06.721 --> 38:09.089
I love these late harvest berries.

38:10.125 --> 38:11.758
They're like candy.

38:14.262 --> 38:15.929
Mom is everything okay?

38:15.931 --> 38:18.098
You should tell Arthur
and Paul the truth.

38:19.134 --> 38:22.001
- I want to, I do...
- Then why don't you?

38:22.003 --> 38:25.271
Your father and I
raised you to be honest.

38:25.273 --> 38:26.639
No matter the consequences.

38:26.641 --> 38:30.009
I'm going to tell them. I'm just
waiting for the right moment.

38:31.346 --> 38:33.780
You don't need the right moment
to tell the truth.

38:43.158 --> 38:44.158
I mean, you know.

38:47.529 --> 38:49.229
Something on your mind?

38:49.231 --> 38:52.465
I mean I remember you being bad but
I don't remember you being this bad.

38:57.739 --> 39:01.808
- Throwing arm must still be asleep.
- Yeah, must be.

39:06.014 --> 39:09.716
You ever think about
leaving Saint Francisville?

39:09.718 --> 39:13.186
- Well I went to the Bahamas last December.
- You never told me that.

39:13.188 --> 39:14.954
What do you think I do when
you shut down for the winter?

39:14.956 --> 39:17.824
Do you think I just roast
pecans and twiddle my thumbs?

39:19.127 --> 39:21.828
I guess I'm crazy if you're thinking
this town is all I need.

39:24.733 --> 39:26.432
Wayne.

39:26.434 --> 39:28.501
Look at where I'm standing.

39:28.503 --> 39:31.237
Home isn't where you go,
it's where you come back.

39:33.175 --> 39:35.642
- That's pretty good.
- Read it off a bottle cap.

39:48.190 --> 39:49.623
Good morning Arthur.

39:49.625 --> 39:52.025
- Morning.
- Morning.

39:54.296 --> 39:56.696
- What is this?
- Mi Esperanza, it's from Honduras.

39:56.698 --> 39:58.531
It's delicious Arthur.

39:58.533 --> 40:03.236
Mi Esperanza. This stuff's
like 35 bucks a pound.

40:03.238 --> 40:06.172
Well we wanted to make sure
you're as comfortable as possible.

40:06.174 --> 40:10.710
I appreciate the gesture but,
I just like my coffee a little simpler.

40:12.848 --> 40:17.017
I think we have simpler coffee
lying around somewhere.

40:18.220 --> 40:20.453
Hey you guys
need to get ready to go.

40:20.455 --> 40:22.822
- Why, where are we going?
- Port Hudson.

40:22.824 --> 40:27.193
Yes, it's part of Spring Festival.
They're giving tours of civil war sights.

40:27.195 --> 40:28.328
Well yeah, it was on my itinerary.

40:28.330 --> 40:32.232
Itinerary yes.
I told ya I'd look it over.

40:32.234 --> 40:33.366
More walking.

40:34.469 --> 40:37.337
- Would you be joining us Amy?
- Sure.

40:37.339 --> 40:38.838
I'll change into something
more comfortable and then...

40:38.840 --> 40:41.308
Actually Amy and I have
some errands to run in town.

40:41.310 --> 40:43.143
We'll catch up
with you in a bit.

40:45.948 --> 40:50.250
Doug's Mellow Brew Mud.
I'm gonna have to give this a try.

41:04.433 --> 41:06.166
What are you doing?

41:06.168 --> 41:09.602
Well there are classic cars this year
so I think if we go around the...

41:09.604 --> 41:12.439
Why don't you look with your
eyes, not your itinerary.

41:17.112 --> 41:19.112
- Well I'll be.
- Good morning Burt.

41:19.114 --> 41:20.447
Loretta Johnson.

41:21.783 --> 41:24.417
- I'd heard rumors.
- Good ears.

41:24.419 --> 41:26.086
News travels fast
in a small town.

41:27.255 --> 41:30.824
- Truck looks great.
- Don't she?

41:30.826 --> 41:33.493
Yeah, see what happens when
you take care of something?

41:33.495 --> 41:34.961
Remember Loretta's old car?

41:36.498 --> 41:38.665
You used to cruise around
that little red Miata.

41:38.667 --> 41:41.334
I can't believe
you remember my Miata.

41:41.336 --> 41:44.738
- And your mom drives a two tone
teal green Subaru station wagon.

41:44.740 --> 41:47.874
And your dad, he drove
that 68 Chevy Nova SS,

41:47.876 --> 41:51.711
big block 396 rock crusher,
four speed two door coupe.

41:52.848 --> 41:55.682
Got some work coming your way.
Fixing up that old barn.

41:55.684 --> 41:59.419
Finally, you've only been talking
about it for like two years.

41:59.421 --> 42:03.056
Well Loretta brought some clients
and they're overpaying frankly so...

42:03.058 --> 42:04.591
Don't sell yourself short Wayne.

42:04.593 --> 42:07.293
Sometimes, the good guys win.

42:08.296 --> 42:11.164
Y'all have a fun day.
And you come back and see me.

42:11.166 --> 42:13.833
I will do.
So good to see you.

42:15.137 --> 42:17.972
See ya bud, have fun.
Alrighty.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.107
Gosh, I haven't seen Burt in so long.

42:22.210 --> 42:25.745
- What a spread!
- You're so sweet.

42:26.882 --> 42:29.749
And Loretta, I haven't
seen you in ages.

42:29.751 --> 42:33.019
Smell these pecans.
I have got to get a jar.

42:33.021 --> 42:34.021
Of course.

42:34.656 --> 42:36.222
Alright, how much do I owe ya?

42:36.224 --> 42:38.758
After what you did for us,
they're on the house.

42:38.760 --> 42:40.193
Thank you.

42:40.195 --> 42:43.363
Hey Wayne. Forgot to show you
something. Come her real quick.

42:43.365 --> 42:45.698
Sure thing Burt.
I will be right back.

42:46.802 --> 42:49.669
- I wish you'd let us pay for those.
- No way.

42:49.671 --> 42:51.704
When my husband broke his ankle,

42:51.706 --> 42:55.341
Wayne stepped up and helped out
with our harvest. Free of charge!

42:55.343 --> 42:57.777
We would have been
sunk without him.

42:57.779 --> 43:01.081
Sorry, Burt was just showing me
pictures of his new plane.

43:01.083 --> 43:02.582
Burt has a plane?

43:02.584 --> 43:04.384
Yeah, yeah, this little
crop duster he fixed up.

43:04.386 --> 43:06.619
He's been volunteering
it to hospitals.

43:06.621 --> 43:09.189
Back and forth between
Baton Rouge and Dallas

43:09.191 --> 43:10.090
and that sort of thing.

43:10.092 --> 43:12.625
- Captain Burt.
- I know right?

43:12.627 --> 43:17.330
Well, we have bothered
Mrs. Wilson long enough.

43:17.332 --> 43:18.431
Let's get moving.

43:18.433 --> 43:20.934
Stop.
Don't forget your pecans.

43:20.936 --> 43:21.936
How could I.

43:22.737 --> 43:24.671
- Thank you Mrs. Wilson.
- You're welcome, bye bye.

43:24.673 --> 43:27.607
- Good to see you.
- Enjoy the festival.

43:27.609 --> 43:30.243
That was very sweet of you
to help Mrs. Wilson like you did.

43:30.245 --> 43:32.846
Well this is Saint Francisville.
We help our neighbors.

43:32.848 --> 43:34.981
Thank you Wayne.

43:38.653 --> 43:39.819
We can catch up with
Paul and Arthur if we...

43:39.821 --> 43:40.821
Wait.

43:42.257 --> 43:43.990
Can I grab one of these?

43:47.262 --> 43:49.129
Wild violets.

43:49.131 --> 43:51.731
Took me a couple of years,
but I finally found you some.

43:51.733 --> 43:54.834
- Okay, what is this?
- Well it's the Spring Festival.

43:54.836 --> 43:59.606
No, this. I feel like you're playing
me a Saint Francisville mix tape.

44:01.109 --> 44:03.443
After what you said about
your father never leaving town...

44:04.746 --> 44:06.846
...I wanted to remind you
that Saint Francisville

44:06.848 --> 44:08.848
isn't the worst place
to spend your life.

44:11.520 --> 44:13.786
Well that's very sweet.

44:26.334 --> 44:28.168
Five bucks.

44:28.170 --> 44:29.170
What?

44:44.186 --> 44:45.186
Oh man.

44:47.522 --> 44:52.125
- Everything okay Mr. Perenti?
- Yeah yeah, just got a,

44:52.127 --> 44:53.426
I don't...

44:53.428 --> 44:54.994
Here.

44:54.996 --> 44:57.363
Any progress with
Arthur on the walk?

44:57.365 --> 44:58.831
Not an inch.

44:58.833 --> 45:01.535
- I don't mean to add more pressure...
- I know.

45:02.837 --> 45:05.905
Michelle would marry me with
or without Arthur's blessing.

45:05.907 --> 45:07.974
I just don't want to put her
in that position.

45:09.578 --> 45:10.578
There's still time.

45:14.316 --> 45:17.217
- Hey there's getting it out there.
- Yeah, a little better.

45:17.219 --> 45:19.085
It's kind of all on
the rod tip isn't it?

45:21.723 --> 45:22.989
So what do you think of Paul?

45:24.693 --> 45:27.994
- I think he's a nice enough guy.
- Yeah he is.

45:27.996 --> 45:31.864
Just not the kind of guy I pictured
marrying my daughter I guess.

45:45.547 --> 45:47.714
- Need any help with that?
- I got it.

45:48.817 --> 45:52.052
- Sure is a pretty day huh?
- Yeah, sure is.

45:53.255 --> 45:55.888
- Get any bites?
- Yeah, yeah.

45:57.058 --> 46:00.294
- Lot of fun fishing.
- Yeah.

46:01.463 --> 46:02.463
Yeah it is.

46:03.565 --> 46:05.098
At least he's trying.

46:05.100 --> 46:08.401
Maybe that's the problem,
he's trying too hard.

46:08.403 --> 46:11.137
You should tell him to be himself,
he'd get a lot further that way.

46:30.692 --> 46:34.594
You know, I am out here every day
and still I forget how pretty it can be.

46:35.831 --> 46:37.831
It's like I'm seeing it
for the first time.

46:40.102 --> 46:42.569
- A little knotted up.
- It came from Paul's reel.

46:42.571 --> 46:43.571
Oh boy.

46:45.207 --> 46:47.768
It's not that bad. You think
you could give me a hand?

46:48.977 --> 46:51.578
You know the secret
to untangling a knot?

46:51.580 --> 46:54.481
- A knife?
- Yeah sure.

46:54.483 --> 46:57.984
You could always give up, cut it loose.

46:57.986 --> 47:01.454
Or you find where the lines starts.

47:02.524 --> 47:04.224
If you find where the line starts

47:04.226 --> 47:08.294
you can follow it
all the way to the end.

47:11.366 --> 47:12.366
Yeah.

47:14.069 --> 47:15.969
I found the ring in your toolbox.

47:18.840 --> 47:19.840
Lori...

47:20.542 --> 47:21.775
You were gonna propose?

47:22.944 --> 47:24.477
Maybe it's a good thing I didn't.

47:26.615 --> 47:27.647
What do you mean?

47:28.717 --> 47:31.918
Well your big opportunity in LA,
you would of had to choose.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.453
That wouldn't be fair to you.

47:33.455 --> 47:36.923
But you didn't know I was leaving.
Why didn't you propose sooner?

47:36.925 --> 47:38.892
We had a good thing going.

47:38.894 --> 47:41.795
And it never really felt
like the right moment.

47:44.232 --> 47:46.666
What if there's no such thing
as the right moment?

47:48.103 --> 47:51.671
What if that's just an excuse we use
to put off doing hard things?

47:55.577 --> 47:57.677
I need to tell Paul
and Arthur the truth.

47:59.047 --> 48:01.347
- Are you sure?
- It's gonna come out sooner or later.

48:01.349 --> 48:03.349
It might as well be sooner.

48:03.351 --> 48:04.517
That takes guts.

48:28.143 --> 48:29.911
- Hello?
- Hi.

48:30.979 --> 48:31.979
Who is this?

48:33.081 --> 48:34.081
Well who's this?

48:35.350 --> 48:37.584
This is Amy Bennett,
I was looking for Loretta.

48:50.899 --> 48:53.266
Where did I put that phone?

48:55.904 --> 48:57.103
Looking for this?

48:58.173 --> 48:59.272
Yeah thanks.

49:00.876 --> 49:01.876
Everything okay?

49:02.811 --> 49:04.311
I'm a little sore.

49:04.313 --> 49:07.280
Came in looking for some ice and
then you got a phone call.

49:08.350 --> 49:10.684
- Okay.
- From Amy Bennett.

49:12.321 --> 49:15.288
- Don't worry I covered for you.
- Mr. Perenti I am so sorry.

49:15.290 --> 49:18.258
If this weekend hasn't been
embarrassing enough for me...

49:18.260 --> 49:20.627
- Look, I was gonna tell you...
- Why did you lie to me?

49:21.964 --> 49:24.898
I was mad at my boss for
passing me up for promotion.

49:24.900 --> 49:26.466
I thought if I did this on my own,

49:26.468 --> 49:28.702
she could see that I could be
more than just an assistant.

49:28.704 --> 49:30.937
You're her assistant.
That's just perfect.

49:30.939 --> 49:34.708
I'll talk to Arthur in the morning.
And accept full responsibility.

49:34.710 --> 49:35.609
No.

49:35.611 --> 49:37.978
That'll make me look even worse.

49:37.980 --> 49:39.145
What do you want me to do?

49:39.147 --> 49:41.414
I guess just keep up the Amy Bennett
act for the rest of the weekend.

49:41.416 --> 49:46.152
And then when we get back to LA
we'll have a much longer conversation.

49:59.201 --> 50:01.301
I need you to keep calling me Amy.

50:01.303 --> 50:04.304
- What happened to telling the truth?
- Paul found out last night.

50:04.306 --> 50:06.106
He's afraid it'll make him look bad.

50:06.108 --> 50:08.074
So Arthur's the only one
that doesn't know?

50:08.076 --> 50:09.509
Yeah.

50:09.511 --> 50:11.778
You better hope he doesn't find out.
I don't think he'd like being the

50:11.780 --> 50:13.313
only one not in on a secret.

50:16.685 --> 50:21.354
We are going to split up into groups
of two so we can cover more woods.

50:21.356 --> 50:25.025
Arthur, you and Susan stick together.
Paul, you're with Amy.

50:25.027 --> 50:26.593
Maybe Arthur and Paul
could go together.

50:26.595 --> 50:28.828
I want one person in
each group that knows

50:28.830 --> 50:30.597
the woods so nobody gets lost.

50:31.733 --> 50:35.068
I gave each one of you
one of Abby's old dog trackers.

50:35.070 --> 50:37.170
If you see the wood pecker
we don't wanna spook him

50:37.172 --> 50:38.772
so hit the button on the side.

50:38.774 --> 50:41.041
It'll come up on my phone
and we will come find you.

50:41.043 --> 50:45.111
Now you could hook it
on your belt and let's do it.

50:46.281 --> 50:47.781
After you Mrs. Johnson.

50:49.217 --> 50:50.217
Come on Paul.

50:53.121 --> 50:54.587
I'm sorry Mr. Perenti.

50:54.589 --> 50:56.990
I know this weekend hasn't
exactly gone according to my plan.

50:56.992 --> 50:59.626
No it hasn't Amy, Loretta.

51:01.029 --> 51:02.629
But I tell you what.

51:02.631 --> 51:05.231
I would spend a thousand
weekends like this for Michelle.

51:06.268 --> 51:07.567
She's lucky to have you.

51:08.904 --> 51:11.238
You ever felt that way about anyone?
Or anything?

51:12.741 --> 51:13.741
I'm not sure.

51:14.776 --> 51:17.744
Well you did lie to further your career
so you must want that pretty badly.

51:44.706 --> 51:49.442
- Hey, something the matter ma'am?
- Are you always so set in your ways?

51:49.444 --> 51:52.979
- I'm not so set in my ways.
- I don't know about that.

51:52.981 --> 51:56.116
I think it's good to change
the way we think from time to time.

51:56.118 --> 51:57.584
At least the way we
think about people.

51:57.586 --> 52:00.587
- Oh you mean Paul.
- I think you should give him a chance.

52:00.589 --> 52:03.123
I just want what's best
for my daughter.

52:03.125 --> 52:05.191
And how would you know
what's best for your daughter?

52:05.193 --> 52:06.793
We do the best we can but,

52:06.795 --> 52:09.963
at some point, they become
their own person.

52:11.233 --> 52:14.534
So if Paul makes
your daughter happy,

52:14.536 --> 52:16.302
maybe that's what's
best for her.

52:31.153 --> 52:32.153
Oh shoot.

52:33.288 --> 52:35.388
Don't worry, it happens all the time.

52:36.658 --> 52:39.859
- Would you please stop doing that?
- What?

52:39.861 --> 52:43.129
Telling me everything's okay.
I mess up I mess up.

52:44.199 --> 52:45.199
Sorry.

52:46.768 --> 52:47.768
Wait wait wait.

52:50.172 --> 52:52.672
Do you hear that?
Pileated woodpecker.

53:00.816 --> 53:02.115
Got him!

53:02.117 --> 53:04.484
You're a wise woman Mrs. Johnson.

53:04.486 --> 53:06.586
Well maybe wisdom comes with age.

53:06.588 --> 53:08.988
Yeah, we both ought
to be pretty wise then.

53:10.759 --> 53:11.858
Any luck?

53:11.860 --> 53:17.297
Awe no woodpeckers but, you know,
a day spent in the woods is never wasted.

53:17.299 --> 53:20.200
I'm sorry Arthur.
I thought we'd find one.

53:20.202 --> 53:22.802
- Where's Amy and Paul?
- We haven't seen them.

53:22.804 --> 53:25.439
Maybe I should.
One sec.

53:26.975 --> 53:28.675
And that was Paul's tracker.

53:28.677 --> 53:30.810
He probably fell down
and pushed the button.

53:30.812 --> 53:34.448
- Or maybe he found a bird.
- Alright come on.

53:39.855 --> 53:42.189
- You're absolutely sure?
- I'm sure.

53:44.726 --> 53:47.427
'Cause a lot of different birds
sound the same you know?

53:47.429 --> 53:49.729
Loretta, I know you think
I'm helpless.

53:49.731 --> 53:51.498
In your defense I've given you
plenty of reason.

53:51.500 --> 53:55.769
- But in this case I am sure okay.
- Okay.

54:19.294 --> 54:20.294
Good.

54:26.668 --> 54:28.334
Hey, you find anything?

54:28.336 --> 54:30.370
- Paul thought he heard...
- I know what I heard.

54:30.372 --> 54:32.205
It's around here somewhere.

54:32.207 --> 54:35.141
It can be tough. The way the bird
calls bounce around the trees.

54:35.143 --> 54:37.278
There it is!
There it is.

54:38.380 --> 54:39.380
See.

54:43.885 --> 54:46.619
- Well I'll be.
- Well look at that little cutie.

54:46.621 --> 54:49.055
- Paul how'd you know?
- I knew what I heard.

54:49.057 --> 54:51.124
I looked up the call online
this morning.

54:52.060 --> 54:53.426
Sounds almost like a monkey.

54:57.699 --> 54:58.699
Boy Paul!

55:06.575 --> 55:09.042
You should see Tanzania Paul.

55:09.044 --> 55:12.946
Impalas, far as the eye can see.
Herds of them.

55:12.948 --> 55:15.715
- Really?
- You've seen Impalas.

55:15.717 --> 55:19.385
- Only in pictures.
- Well, pictures don't do 'em justice.

55:19.387 --> 55:22.622
I don't know what you told Arthur
mom, but it did the trick.

55:22.624 --> 55:25.325
You have to tell Arthur
the truth about who you are.

55:25.327 --> 55:28.194
Mom please, Arthur and Paul
are finally getting along.

55:29.497 --> 55:32.432
- She's got a point Ms. Johnson.
- What, now you too?

55:34.035 --> 55:37.203
Alright, I'm gonna go start dinner.
See you two inside.

55:39.007 --> 55:41.307
She's right, this whole thing's
gotten out of hand.

55:41.309 --> 55:43.862
If Paul already knows the truth,
then Arthur,

55:43.897 --> 55:47.213
maybe I'd wait until he signs
the marriage license.

55:50.852 --> 55:52.385
God this weekend...

55:53.722 --> 55:56.089
...I would never have been
able to do without you.

55:56.091 --> 55:58.391
Be careful, you aint
out of the woods yet.

56:03.098 --> 56:05.699
- Are you expecting more guests?
- No.

56:09.704 --> 56:10.704
Howard?

56:14.309 --> 56:16.476
- Howard!
- Well hello darling.

56:18.179 --> 56:22.315
I tried to call, believe me but,
you know, service looks a little,

56:22.317 --> 56:23.583
a little spotty down here.

56:25.053 --> 56:27.954
- Hey man, Howard Hodgekiss.
- Wayne Hendricks.

56:27.956 --> 56:29.489
I thought you were filming
in Memphis?

56:29.491 --> 56:32.793
Yeah yeah I had the evening off
so, you know, road trip.

56:33.695 --> 56:34.695
Yeah I missed you,

56:35.463 --> 56:36.229
Amy.

56:36.231 --> 56:38.798
Wait, Wayne knows who I am
so you don't have to call me Amy.

56:38.800 --> 56:42.670
Okay, got it.
Our little secret huh?

56:43.972 --> 56:47.040
- Wait a minute...
- Loretta's boyfriend, yeah.

56:47.042 --> 56:49.676
Yeah, I just hope she doesn't
talk about me too much.

56:56.418 --> 56:59.619
- Things are delicate right now.
- Delicate how?

56:59.621 --> 57:02.455
Well Mr. Perenti and Mr. Wellerson
are finally getting along.

57:02.457 --> 57:04.023
Well what do you think
I'm gonna do?

57:04.025 --> 57:06.959
- I just don't want a scene.
- Honey, why would I make a scene?

57:08.630 --> 57:10.997
Though I was thinking
on the ride down here,

57:10.999 --> 57:13.333
would Amy Bennett really
be dating an actor?

57:13.335 --> 57:14.967
- Absolutely.
- Just hear me out.

57:14.969 --> 57:17.303
Or, would she be with,

57:19.040 --> 57:22.475
Pierce Bonham, galleria
owner and aficienado.

57:26.247 --> 57:30.859
When Ms. Bennett first strode
into my art gallery,

57:30.894 --> 57:33.319
it was like a masterpiece come to life.

57:34.656 --> 57:36.789
What was it you came in for
that first night my love?

57:36.791 --> 57:40.126
Was it a, a Monet print
for your charity auction yes?

57:40.128 --> 57:42.161
You remember it better than I do.

57:42.163 --> 57:46.032
And just like that,
we fell in love.

57:46.034 --> 57:49.969
- Where's your gallery Pierce?
- Small neighborhood.

57:49.971 --> 57:52.138
If you aren't from Los Angeles you...

57:52.140 --> 57:56.109
Silver Lake, Venice, Beverly Hills?

57:56.111 --> 57:58.511
Ms. Johnson,
could you show Pierce to his room?

57:59.881 --> 58:02.015
- Absolutely.
- Pardon me.

58:02.684 --> 58:03.684
Right this way.

58:05.587 --> 58:08.054
Take your time.
As much as you need.

58:08.056 --> 58:09.756
Well he's quite a character.

58:12.060 --> 58:13.760
Character's right.

58:16.264 --> 58:20.466
- So you're dating Loretta.
- Who?

58:20.468 --> 58:24.036
- It's okay I'm Loretta's mother.
- Hi.

58:24.038 --> 58:27.440
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- Finally?

58:27.442 --> 58:29.609
How long have you two
been dating?

58:29.611 --> 58:34.180
- Well April makes, about six months.
- Six months.

58:35.049 --> 58:36.816
That sounds serious.

58:36.818 --> 58:39.752
- Yeah, we're taking it pretty slow.
- Yes, I'd say very slow.

58:39.754 --> 58:42.922
She hasn't even mentioned you,
much less brought you home to visit.

58:42.924 --> 58:44.524
Well look, I've been wanting
to come,

58:44.526 --> 58:48.561
but, you know Loretta.
She just works so hard.

58:50.098 --> 58:51.098
Yes she does.

58:53.101 --> 58:55.135
- Enjoy your stay.
- Okay.

58:59.474 --> 59:00.474
Wayne.

59:01.743 --> 59:02.743
Wayne talk to me.

59:04.379 --> 59:06.312
What's there to talk about?
Pierce?

59:06.314 --> 59:09.048
- He seems like a great guy.
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

59:10.351 --> 59:11.818
I don't care.

59:11.820 --> 59:13.986
You might want to tell him
to tone down the act though.

59:13.988 --> 59:16.889
So Howard's an actor,
he can be a little dramatic.

59:16.891 --> 59:20.293
He's an actor. 'Cause Pierce
Bohnam really had me fooled.

59:20.295 --> 59:23.463
You know you're kind of being a jerk.
You never even asked if I was single.

59:23.465 --> 59:27.033
Kinda how Arthur never asked
if you're really Amy Bennett?

59:27.035 --> 59:29.502
That's not the same thing
and you know it.

59:29.504 --> 59:30.837
You're right, I'm sorry.

59:32.373 --> 59:35.308
You've got your life in LA,
I've got my life here.

59:35.310 --> 59:36.310
I get that now.

01:00:02.537 --> 01:00:04.338
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:00:05.406 --> 01:00:08.508
You didn't think that Pierce Bonham
might have been a little bit much?

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:10.877
My boyfriend.
I didn't ask him to do that.

01:00:17.085 --> 01:00:18.085
Loretta...

01:00:19.521 --> 01:00:24.891
If a story starts with a lie, does
it matter if it has a happy ending?

01:00:25.593 --> 01:00:29.196
- I don't know Mr. Perenti.
- Neither do I.

01:00:30.698 --> 01:00:34.100
I don't know if Arthur's ever gonna
think I'm good enough for his daughter.

01:00:34.102 --> 01:00:35.468
This weekend has been hard.

01:00:36.704 --> 01:00:39.939
But the hardest part by far has been
being away from Michelle.

01:00:39.941 --> 01:00:41.841
Ask him for his blessing tonight.

01:00:43.011 --> 01:00:45.578
- What if he says no?
- Then he says no.

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:48.147
But you can waste your whole life
waiting for the right moment.

01:00:48.149 --> 01:00:49.515
You have to ask him.

01:00:55.056 --> 01:00:56.340
You a picker?

01:00:56.341 --> 01:00:59.225
Yeah, I might of had a band
back in college.

01:00:59.227 --> 01:01:02.094
Fire's going. You should
come out and play something.

01:01:02.096 --> 01:01:04.297
No.
I couldn't do that.

01:01:04.299 --> 01:01:08.167
Arthur, I could sure use
a love song right about now.

01:01:10.305 --> 01:01:11.305
I might have one.

01:01:15.443 --> 01:01:18.945
Well I might be a little
rusty so hang with me.

01:02:53.975 --> 01:02:55.742
- Very nice.
- Thanks.

01:02:56.811 --> 01:03:03.716
- Is there anything that you can't do?
- Well, I'm not a very good dancer.

01:03:03.718 --> 01:03:07.353
Actually that's not true.
I'm a great dancer.

01:03:16.431 --> 01:03:18.764
- Arthur.
- Yeah Paul.

01:03:18.766 --> 01:03:19.732
There's something
that I've been wanting...

01:03:19.734 --> 01:03:21.067
I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:03:22.403 --> 01:03:26.072
I just, I simply can't hold it in
any longer.

01:03:29.977 --> 01:03:32.344
I was going to do this
back in Los Angeles but,

01:03:33.614 --> 01:03:35.681
after hearing Arthur's song
I just, I can't.

01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:38.417
I can't wait another minute.

01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:45.591
Amy Antoinette Bennett,

01:03:48.696 --> 01:03:50.196
will you marry me?

01:03:57.638 --> 01:03:59.004
Is this for real?

01:04:03.611 --> 01:04:07.947
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, I guess love is in the air huh?

01:04:21.497 --> 01:04:22.497
Was that real?

01:04:23.566 --> 01:04:25.032
What do you mean?

01:04:25.034 --> 01:04:27.501
Well was that Pierce
proposing to Amy

01:04:27.503 --> 01:04:30.270
or was that Howard
proposing to Loretta?

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.142
You know, I got lost
in the character.

01:04:36.245 --> 01:04:38.545
- I can't marry you.
- I'm so glad you said that.

01:04:39.882 --> 01:04:43.450
I've been hiding away. Not just
from you but from myself too.

01:04:44.653 --> 01:04:45.653
I'm so sorry.

01:04:46.655 --> 01:04:50.958
Yeah it's been six months.
Never thought to bring me here.

01:04:51.594 --> 01:04:53.060
This is your home.

01:04:53.062 --> 01:04:57.464
I guess you never saw me
being a part of that.

01:04:57.466 --> 01:05:01.735
You know I think I got lost
in Pierce and Amy because

01:05:03.238 --> 01:05:06.673
inside I kind of knew
that Howard and Loretta...

01:05:06.675 --> 01:05:08.008
Weren't meant to be.

01:05:12.181 --> 01:05:13.181
It's alright.

01:05:16.785 --> 01:05:18.185
Alright, I'm gonna head out.

01:05:19.455 --> 01:05:22.255
Sorry Pierce is leaving ya
with a bit of a mess.

01:05:22.257 --> 01:05:26.259
Don't worry about it.
I could do with a plot twist anyway.

01:05:32.134 --> 01:05:33.500
We'll always have brunch.

01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:35.836
We'll always have brunch.

01:05:47.316 --> 01:05:50.917
Pierce had to head back to Memphis.
He's sorry he couldn't stay for dinner.

01:05:50.919 --> 01:05:53.053
Oh well that's too bad.

01:05:54.657 --> 01:05:58.358
Hey Paul, before Pierce
stole the show out there,

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.861
it seemed like there was something
you were trying to say.

01:06:00.863 --> 01:06:01.863
There was.

01:06:03.832 --> 01:06:06.733
I mean, there is.

01:06:06.735 --> 01:06:07.868
Well go ahead.

01:06:10.806 --> 01:06:12.472
Excuse me.

01:06:12.474 --> 01:06:17.210
Before I bring out supper,
I would like to propose a toast.

01:06:17.212 --> 01:06:21.448
First, to Arthur and to Paul.

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:24.484
We sincerely hope that
you had a really good time.

01:06:24.486 --> 01:06:26.887
It could not have been
any better Susan.

01:06:26.889 --> 01:06:27.587
Really.

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:28.922
And to Ms. Bennett.

01:06:30.459 --> 01:06:35.128
I know your own mother could not
be here for your engagement so,

01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:38.065
I would like to congratulate you
on her behalf.

01:06:39.501 --> 01:06:46.273
Now I can only say what I would say
to my own daughter which is,

01:06:46.275 --> 01:06:49.743
you are my whole world.

01:06:49.745 --> 01:06:55.682
And I wish you the happiest life
that you can ever imagine.

01:06:59.254 --> 01:07:00.687
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:03.957
I should have done
this a long time ago.

01:07:06.228 --> 01:07:10.130
My name is not Amy Bennett.
It's Loretta Johnson.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.368
I grew up in Saint Francisville Louisiana
and this is my mother.

01:07:18.307 --> 01:07:20.107
Come on,
what are you talking about?

01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:25.145
I pretended to be my boss so Mr. Perenti
would hire me to plan this trip.

01:07:25.147 --> 01:07:30.016
I don't understand.
You know about this Paul?

01:07:30.018 --> 01:07:32.986
- Not at first.
- So you did know about this?

01:07:32.988 --> 01:07:36.223
Arthur, I eventually figured it out.

01:07:36.225 --> 01:07:38.191
Please, I would do anything
for your daughter

01:07:38.193 --> 01:07:40.327
and I didn't wanna disrupt
this weekend.

01:07:43.098 --> 01:07:45.165
So you were all in on this?

01:07:47.236 --> 01:07:50.337
Well you must think
I'm a pretty big joke huh?

01:07:53.909 --> 01:07:55.342
Hope you had a good laugh.

01:07:57.212 --> 01:08:00.413
Arthur, it's not like that.

01:08:14.196 --> 01:08:16.429
I'm really not in the mood
for I told you so's.

01:08:17.599 --> 01:08:19.832
- Actually I'm impressed.
- Impressed?

01:08:19.835 --> 01:08:22.234
- This is a disaster.
- Yeah it's a disaster.

01:08:22.237 --> 01:08:24.537
But before it turned
into a disaster,

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:27.140
you showed those
guys a great weekend.

01:08:27.142 --> 01:08:28.707
God, I don't know what to do.

01:08:29.978 --> 01:08:32.479
Well you know where
those answers aren't?

01:08:32.481 --> 01:08:33.481
In that binder.

01:08:34.783 --> 01:08:36.483
The plan's kaput.

01:08:36.484 --> 01:08:38.185
And that leaves you
with one option, to improvise.

01:08:38.187 --> 01:08:39.953
But I'm not like you.

01:08:39.955 --> 01:08:42.189
I don't just improvise.
I plan things out.

01:08:42.191 --> 01:08:43.890
Loretta, listen to me.

01:08:43.892 --> 01:08:46.225
You are the smartest person
that I know.

01:08:47.296 --> 01:08:50.462
If anybody can figure this out,
it's you.

01:08:57.406 --> 01:08:58.406
Hey Wayne.

01:08:59.675 --> 01:09:01.073
What's Burt's phone number?

01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:34.709
Good morning.

01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:40.779
- Loretta Johnson.
- I think we've met.

01:09:40.782 --> 01:09:44.283
You met Amy Bennett.
Now you're meeting me.

01:09:47.089 --> 01:09:48.520
Well nice to meet you Loretta.

01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:52.559
There's someone here
who wants to talk to you.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.897
- I don't wanna talk to Paul.
- It's not Paul.

01:10:00.402 --> 01:10:01.701
Sweetheart!

01:10:03.005 --> 01:10:05.872
Hi dad!

01:10:05.874 --> 01:10:09.142
- Well how...
- Fresh off a red eye.

01:10:09.144 --> 01:10:12.679
There's a red eye from Los Angeles
to Saint Francisville?

01:10:12.681 --> 01:10:14.381
LA to Dallas.

01:10:14.383 --> 01:10:15.815
My friend Burt picked her up
in his plane

01:10:15.817 --> 01:10:17.884
so she could see you
before you left for Tanzania.

01:10:17.886 --> 01:10:21.354
You flew an airplane in the middle
of the night from Dallas Texas?

01:10:21.356 --> 01:10:25.492
He's from Saint Francisville.
Neighbors help each other.

01:10:25.494 --> 01:10:26.893
I'm exhausted.

01:10:26.895 --> 01:10:29.896
So if you could hear what I have
to say that would be great.

01:10:29.898 --> 01:10:35.035
- All ears.
- I am going to marry Paul.

01:10:35.037 --> 01:10:37.570
And I'm not asking you,
I'm letting you know.

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:42.475
I love him dad.
And he loves me.

01:10:42.477 --> 01:10:45.412
He came with you this weekend
and he hates the outdoors.

01:10:45.414 --> 01:10:48.148
If you can't see
what a great guy he is then...

01:10:50.252 --> 01:10:51.651
...I'm sorry, we're gonna
have to get married

01:10:51.653 --> 01:10:52.653
without your blessing.

01:11:00.996 --> 01:11:02.529
Come on out Paul.

01:11:12.574 --> 01:11:14.674
Are you gonna make
my daughter happy?

01:11:14.676 --> 01:11:15.676
Yes sir.

01:11:16.845 --> 01:11:19.379
And I never meant anything
more my entire life.

01:11:21.249 --> 01:11:27.387
Well, I know you don't need it,
but you have my blessing.

01:11:35.497 --> 01:11:36.963
Thank you dad.

01:11:40.202 --> 01:11:41.202
Hello.

01:11:42.471 --> 01:11:45.505
- Good morning Ms. Bennett.
- Loretta, I hope you're well rested,

01:11:45.507 --> 01:11:47.040
we have a lot of work to do.

01:11:47.042 --> 01:11:49.542
Actually there's something
I have to tell you.

01:11:49.544 --> 01:11:52.746
I pretended to be you so that
Mr. Perenti would hire me.

01:11:52.748 --> 01:11:54.481
Things are a whole lot simpler
when you're a dog huh?

01:11:54.483 --> 01:11:57.250
But he has given us
the Perenti-Wellerson wedding.

01:11:58.587 --> 01:12:00.387
So that's what happened.

01:12:00.389 --> 01:12:02.822
If you want to fire me
I understand.

01:12:04.159 --> 01:12:05.492
Yeah.

01:12:05.494 --> 01:12:09.195
You put at risk the integrity of my company,
everything that I've worked for.

01:12:09.197 --> 01:12:10.597
I know, I'm sorry.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.067
Younger me would've done
the same thing.

01:12:15.003 --> 01:12:17.303
So you're not firing me?

01:12:17.305 --> 01:12:21.875
I do admit that the Perenti-Wellerson
wedding does soften the blow.

01:12:21.877 --> 01:12:23.710
Oh my god I can't believe it.

01:12:23.712 --> 01:12:28.148
I always knew that you were great
with a plan. Very smart Loretta.

01:12:28.150 --> 01:12:30.316
I just needed to see you
sail uncharted waters

01:12:30.318 --> 01:12:32.652
before I made you lead planner.

01:12:32.654 --> 01:12:36.356
- You're making me lead planner?
- I know, shocked myself.

01:12:36.358 --> 01:12:37.991
I must be loopy from the flu meds?

01:12:37.993 --> 01:12:39.292
Wait, what about Elizabeth?

01:12:39.294 --> 01:12:44.998
She took a job doing Oktoberfest
tours. Beer crazy that one.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.768
- Thank you so much Ms. Bennett!
- You and your southern manners.

01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:52.038
- You're coming back today right?
- My flight's in two hours.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.008
Great, I will see you
in my office tomorrow.

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:56.176
Lead planner.

01:12:56.178 --> 01:12:57.178
See ya there.

01:13:02.451 --> 01:13:03.451
Oh my god.

01:13:13.795 --> 01:13:15.161
Thanks for everything mom.

01:13:18.333 --> 01:13:21.835
Sweetheart, don't wait
two years to visit next time.

01:13:21.837 --> 01:13:23.436
I won't, I promise.

01:13:23.438 --> 01:13:26.172
- Heard you got that big promotion.
- How did you...

01:13:26.174 --> 01:13:27.674
I might have been eavesdropping.

01:13:29.478 --> 01:13:31.010
Wayne...

01:13:31.012 --> 01:13:34.147
On behalf of everybody from
Saint Francisville Louisiana,

01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:36.749
let me just say congratulations.

01:13:36.751 --> 01:13:39.519
We couldn't be more proud of you.

01:13:42.457 --> 01:13:43.590
You deserve it.

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.526
Thank you.

01:14:44.619 --> 01:14:48.287
- So you see your lady off?
- Yeah, shouldn't be on a safari?

01:14:48.289 --> 01:14:49.689
Tanzania's not going anywhere.

01:14:49.691 --> 01:14:52.892
I wanna see if there's
any fish left in this river.

01:14:52.894 --> 01:14:56.328
Sundown fever. I've seen it happen
to better men than you.

01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:57.530
You have have you?

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.868
- You've traveled a lot.
- Seven continents.

01:15:04.272 --> 01:15:05.871
Well in all your travels,

01:15:07.775 --> 01:15:09.942
you ever feel like
you lost track of home?

01:15:11.612 --> 01:15:14.080
Wayne, you know,

01:15:14.082 --> 01:15:18.884
when I was a kid I was sweet
on this little girl Lucille.

01:15:18.886 --> 01:15:21.087
- Lucille huh?
- Yeah.

01:15:21.089 --> 01:15:22.988
Me and Lucille were walking
home from church one day

01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:24.457
and she pointed out a bird.

01:15:24.459 --> 01:15:27.660
Now we didn't have a
clue what it was but,

01:15:27.662 --> 01:15:30.429
we just knew it looked
like Woody Woodpecker.

01:15:30.431 --> 01:15:32.364
And that's not the best part.

01:15:32.366 --> 01:15:37.737
While I was looking at the bird, Lucille
gave me a kiss right on the cheek.

01:15:37.739 --> 01:15:40.373
- Arthur you dog.
- Yeah.

01:15:41.309 --> 01:15:42.908
Must have been quite a kiss.

01:15:45.079 --> 01:15:48.581
Lucille ended up becoming my wife.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.253
Wayne I've traveled
the world over.

01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:59.592
You know I never forgot
that pileated woodpecker,

01:16:00.962 --> 01:16:01.962
Lucille,

01:16:04.265 --> 01:16:05.731
or my hometown.

01:16:11.239 --> 01:16:12.772
Hey you better go get her kid.

01:16:14.275 --> 01:16:15.674
She's something special.

01:16:22.183 --> 01:16:25.885
We are gonna be burning a lot of midnight
oil to plan Paul and Michelle's wedding

01:16:25.887 --> 01:16:27.453
and keep up with the other events.

01:16:27.455 --> 01:16:29.054
Yes ma'am.

01:16:29.056 --> 01:16:30.422
I had a thought.

01:16:31.759 --> 01:16:34.326
- You take over the Richmond Ball.
- You're kidding.

01:16:34.328 --> 01:16:38.798
2,000 guests, paparazzi,
one night, all eyes on you.

01:16:40.201 --> 01:16:42.535
I was expecting a little bit
more jumping up and down.

01:16:42.537 --> 01:16:45.772
- This is your dream right?
- Right.

01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:48.474
Good.

01:16:48.476 --> 01:16:53.646
Alright, so what do you think
about this with this?

01:16:55.316 --> 01:16:56.448
Yeah great.

01:17:32.086 --> 01:17:33.086
Wayne?

01:17:34.889 --> 01:17:35.889
Can I come in?

01:17:38.092 --> 01:17:39.092
Yeah.

01:17:43.197 --> 01:17:44.530
You got on an airplane?

01:17:48.269 --> 01:17:49.501
Security is...

01:17:50.671 --> 01:17:54.440
And is LA's weather always like this
because that would drive me insane.

01:17:54.442 --> 01:17:57.743
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see the ocean.

01:17:58.946 --> 01:18:01.982
- And your mom told me about Pierce.
- You mean Howard.

01:18:02.884 --> 01:18:05.217
Guess things didn't work out.

01:18:05.219 --> 01:18:07.720
You flew across the country
to talk to me about my breakup?

01:18:09.123 --> 01:18:11.991
No, no I flew across
the country to tell you

01:18:11.993 --> 01:18:14.460
that I am crazy
about you Loretta.

01:18:14.462 --> 01:18:18.497
All that wide open space,
it feels empty without you.

01:18:18.499 --> 01:18:21.100
Now maybe I'm too late,
maybe I missed my moment but,

01:18:23.371 --> 01:18:25.070
I just wanted to tell you how I feel.

01:18:29.277 --> 01:18:30.109
And now I have.

01:18:30.111 --> 01:18:31.111
So...

01:18:34.115 --> 01:18:35.115
I quit my job.

01:18:39.086 --> 01:18:40.452
But you love your job.

01:18:40.454 --> 01:18:45.224
I know, it was everything
I thought I wanted.

01:18:45.226 --> 01:18:48.227
- So what's the plan?
- I don't have a plan.

01:18:50.598 --> 01:18:51.830
I don't know what's gonna
happen next.

01:18:51.832 --> 01:18:52.898
All I know is,

01:18:55.236 --> 01:18:56.236
I wanna be with you.

01:18:58.406 --> 01:18:59.438
I wanna come home.

01:19:50.291 --> 01:19:53.292
- Hey there beautiful.
- Hey.

01:19:53.294 --> 01:19:55.494
So glad Paul and Michelle decided
to have their wedding here.

01:19:55.496 --> 01:19:56.996
Oh me too.

01:19:56.998 --> 01:20:01.266
- And these azaleas, beautiful.
- They were mom's idea.

01:20:01.268 --> 01:20:02.701
Locally grown too.

01:20:02.703 --> 01:20:05.838
- You nervous Arthur?
- No.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:06.840
No.

01:20:08.609 --> 01:20:09.675
Maybe.

01:20:11.879 --> 01:20:14.046
Don't lock your knees
and you'll be fine.

01:20:35.703 --> 01:20:37.036
She's all yours Paul.

01:20:38.539 --> 01:20:39.539
Thank you sir.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.920
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

01:21:21.248 --> 01:21:25.150
I don't know what's more
beautiful. This lake or you.

01:21:25.152 --> 01:21:28.120
You brought me all the way
out here to tell me that?

01:21:28.122 --> 01:21:32.791
No, I brought out here
to give you this.

01:21:32.793 --> 01:21:34.793
Now I don't know
if the timing feels right.

01:21:34.795 --> 01:21:38.097
I just know that every moment
with you feels right.

01:21:39.567 --> 01:21:43.735
- I love you Loretta Johnson.
- I love you too Wayne Hendricks.

01:21:44.605 --> 01:21:46.572
I wanna show you the world.

01:21:48.142 --> 01:21:50.142
As long as we always come back here.

01:21:58.719 --> 01:22:00.419
Will you marry me?

01:22:01.889 --> 01:22:03.622
Yes, absolutely.
