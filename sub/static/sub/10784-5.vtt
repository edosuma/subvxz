Pacey: THE GUY
ON THE TAPE,

00:03.834 --> 00:06.333
THE GUY WITH
TAMARA JACOBS,

00:06.333 --> 00:07.667
THAT'S ME.

00:07.667 --> 00:08.834
NO.

00:10.417 --> 00:14.375
DO YOU PROMISE ME THAT
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE HONEST
AND UP-FRONT WITH ME?

00:14.375 --> 00:16.166
DON'T YOU THINK,
IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS,

00:16.166 --> 00:19.125
THAT THERE ARE THINGS
THAT PEOPLE JUST
DON'T WANT TO KNOW?

00:19.125 --> 00:21.000
I TOLD HIM
I WASN'T A VIRGIN.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.333
DAWSON, LOOK,
THERE'S YOUR MOM.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.166
YOU KNEW.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.875
HOW COULD YOU
NOT SAY ANYTHING?

00:27.875 --> 00:29.667
I WAS TRYING
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

00:29.667 --> 00:31.166
NO, JOEY.
YOU LIED TO ME!

00:38.291 --> 00:39.625
WHOA.

00:39.625 --> 00:42.083
WELL, SO MUCH
FOR TWISTER.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.083
WHAT'S NEXT?

00:43.083 --> 00:45.208
I VOTE FOR
THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.708
YEAH, BUT TOWERING
INFERNO  HAS A HIGHER
ALL-STAR BODY COUNT.

00:47.708 --> 00:49.333
BUT THEY JUST BURNED.
IN THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE,

00:49.333 --> 00:50.750
THE DEATHS ARE MUCH MORE
INTERESTING.

00:50.750 --> 00:51.375
EVERYTHING'S UPSIDE DOWN.

00:51.375 --> 00:53.041
HEY, IT'S TIME.

00:53.041 --> 00:54.708
LET'S SEE
IF OUR DISASTER

00:54.708 --> 00:56.125
GOOD EVENING
FROM THE WEATHER CENTER,

00:56.125 --> 00:58.667

00:58.667 --> 01:00.667

01:03.208 --> 01:04.708

01:04.708 --> 01:07.875
LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE
GONE AHEAD AND CANCELED
CLASSES FOR TOMORROW

01:07.875 --> 01:09.542

01:12.583 --> 01:14.500
YEAH!
Bob: STAY WITH US. GALE?

01:14.500 --> 01:16.000
Gale: THANKS, HAL.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.208
WELL, BOB, SOUNDS LIKE
TOMORROW WOULD BE A GOOD DAY

01:18.208 --> 01:19.792
JUST TO STAY IN BED.

01:19.792 --> 01:21.000
YOU'VE GOT
THAT RIGHT, GALE.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.166
GOD! COULD THEY BE
ANY MORE OBVIOUS?

01:23.166 --> 01:25.250
SO, GALE, WHAT IS
YOUR VIEW ON THE CURRENT
SITUATION IN BOSNIA,

01:25.250 --> 01:28.125
AND WILL YOU BE
JUMPING MY BONES
AFTER THE BROADCAST?!

01:33.250 --> 01:34.667
DOES YOUR MOM
KNOW YOU KNOW?

01:34.667 --> 01:35.667
NO.

01:35.667 --> 01:37.834
YOUR DAD?

01:37.834 --> 01:39.208
PROFOUNDLY CLUELESS.

01:42.917 --> 01:46.250
SO...PAUL NEWMAN
OR GENE HACKMAN?

01:46.250 --> 01:48.083
UH, YOU KNOW, JOEY,
I'M A LITTLE TIRED.

01:48.083 --> 01:49.291
YOU MIND IF I SACK?

01:49.291 --> 01:52.333
UH...NO. THAT'S FINE.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

02:00.834 --> 02:04.583
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS,
DAWSON.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.708
UH, EVERYTHING'S
POSTPONED BECAUSE
OF THE HURRICANE.

02:07.708 --> 02:08.583
MY LIFE INCLUDED.

02:08.583 --> 02:10.625
YOUR LIFE IS
A HURRICANE.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.375
NO METAPHORS, JOEY.
IT'S TOO LATE.

02:15.375 --> 02:16.625
LATER.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.542
I'LL SEE YA TOMORROW,
JOEY.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.750
HEY, DAWSON?
YEAH?

02:21.750 --> 02:23.291
FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT.

02:23.291 --> 02:25.250
IT'S GONNA BE
A BUMPY LIFE.

02:31.125 --> 02:33.959
Gale: NOW IN OTHER NEWS,
WILLIAM BENNETT SAID TOM BURTON
WOULD CONFER WITH DEMOCRATS

02:33.959 --> 02:38.625
ON THE PANEL TODAY ABOUT
WHETHER THEY WOULD BE WILLING
TO JOIN GOP MEMBERS

02:38.625 --> 02:41.000
IN VOTING TO CONFER
IMMUNITY ON 3 WITNESSES.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.125
A 2/3 VOTE IS REQUIRED.

02:43.125 --> 02:44.625
BACK TO YOU, BOB.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.750
OH, WELL, I GUESS IF IT WERE
THE CAPESIDE BAKE-OFF,

04:03.750 --> 04:05.041
THEN I WOULD BE YOUR MAN.

04:05.041 --> 04:06.959
NO, I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE SARCASTIC.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.750
I'M TRYING
TO BE A REPORTER.

04:08.750 --> 04:12.583
FINE, JIM.
IF ANYBODY NEEDS ME,
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE,

04:12.583 --> 04:14.166
DARNING MY HUSBAND'S SOCKS.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.333
UNBELIEVABLE.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.666
I TAKE IT THEY'RE NOT LETTING
YOU COVER THE HURRICANE.

04:19.666 --> 04:22.208
OF COURSE NOT. I'M MISSING
A CERTAIN APPENDAGE
BETWEEN MY LEGS,

04:22.208 --> 04:23.166
WHICH APPARENTLY
MAKES ONE
UNIQUELY QUALIFIED

04:23.166 --> 04:25.500
TO COVER
INCLEMENT WEATHER.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.583
WELL, ME AND MY APPENDAGE
ARE BOTH THRILLED

04:26.583 --> 04:32.041
THAT YOU WILL BE HERE SAFE,
WHERE YOU BELONG.

04:32.041 --> 04:36.500
ALL RIGHT. FLASHLIGHTS,
CANDLES, COLD SHOWER,
AND BATTERIES.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.291
THANKS, DAWSON. LISTEN,
I'M GONNA RUN NEXT DOOR

04:39.291 --> 04:41.000
AND CHECK ON JEN

EXTEND AN INVITATION
TO RIDE OUT THE STORM.

04:42.625 --> 04:43.834
OK.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.917
MY DAD'S A GREAT GUY,
ISN'T HE?

04:51.917 --> 04:54.000
MAYBE ON THE TOM HANKS,
HARRISON FORD
IDEALISTIC SIDE,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.667
BUT SOLID LIKE A ROCK.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.125
WITHOUT QUESTION.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.625
AND FAITHFUL.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.542
EVEN TO A FAULT.

05:03.542 --> 05:05.792
MM-HMM.

05:05.792 --> 05:08.166
SO WHO'S COVERING,

05:08.166 --> 05:10.875
HUH. BOB GOT THE GIG.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.458

05:18.375 --> 05:22.375
UM, HONEY, DID YOU
SECURE THE FRONT PORCH?

05:22.375 --> 05:23.333
I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

05:23.333 --> 05:26.708
UM, GOTTA GET READY

OH, BOY.

05:45.583 --> 05:47.458
I JUST WANT IT KNOWN

05:47.458 --> 05:48.750
THAT I AM HERE
UNDER COMPLETE DURESS.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.166
OH, JUST STOP
YOUR PUNK-ASS WHINING.

05:50.166 --> 05:52.417
SCHOOL'S OUT TODAY.

05:52.417 --> 05:54.625
IT'S MY ONE CHANCE
TO SLEEP IN,

05:54.625 --> 05:56.500
CATCH UP ON MY SOAPS,
ENJOY THE STORM.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.166
HEY, DAD'S ORDERS.

05:58.166 --> 06:01.166
DAD'S ORDERS. YOU SAY THAT
WITH SUCH A LAPDOG ENTHUSIASM.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.583
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA
KICK YOUR ASS.

06:02.583 --> 06:04.291
[EFFEMINATE TONE]
OH, YOU'RE SO BUTCH, DOUGIE.

06:04.291 --> 06:06.166
OH...SCREW YOU.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.667
DOUG, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO LEARN HOW TO PROCESS

06:07.667 --> 06:08.667
THESE HOSTILE
OUTBURSTS OF RAGE.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.542
I MEAN, ANY THERAPIST
IS GONNA TELL YOU

06:10.542 --> 06:12.458
THAT THESE ARE JUST
MERE REPRESSION TACTICS

06:12.458 --> 06:15.333
TO MASK YOUR TRUE
HOMOSEXUAL DESIRES.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.750
JUST BECAUSE I'M PRETTY
DOESN'T MEAN I'M GAY.

06:17.750 --> 06:19.875
I HAPPEN TO BE
THE STRAIGHTEST GUY I KNOW.

06:19.875 --> 06:21.208
OH, REALLY?

06:21.208 --> 06:23.583
I THINK YOUR
CD COLLECTION WOULD
CONTRADICT THAT.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.792
BARBRA STREISAND,
THE SOUNDTRACK
TO LES MIZ...

06:26.792 --> 06:29.542
I HAVE AN INTERESTING
AND SOFT COMPLEXITY.

06:29.542 --> 06:32.166
YOU KNOW, DOUG,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DEFEND YOURSELF TO ME.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.625
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

06:33.625 --> 06:36.333
I JUST WANT YOU TO LIVE
A HAPPY AND, UH,
FRUITFUL LIFE.

06:36.333 --> 06:39.375
YOU KNOW, WOMEN HAPPEN
TO LOVE MY CD COLLECTION.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.708
ANSWER ME THIS.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.458
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
A PROFESSION THAT
REQUIRES YOU TO DRESS

06:44.458 --> 06:46.458
LIKE ONE
OF THE VILLAGE PEOPLE?

06:46.458 --> 06:49.500
I CHOSE TO WEAR A BADGE
BECAUSE OUR FATHER,

06:49.500 --> 06:51.166
THE CHIEF OF POLICE
OF CAPESIDE,

06:51.166 --> 06:54.041
INSTILLED IN ME
A SENSE OF DUTY
AND A BELIEF IN JUSTICE.

06:54.041 --> 06:55.208
RIGHT, WHICH MAKES IT
ALL THE HARDER FOR YOU
TO COME OUT.

06:55.208 --> 06:57.667
I UNDERSTAND THAT, DOUG.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.959
YOU KNOW, I'M SURE THAT
THERE ARE SUPPORT GROUPS
FOR GAY OFFICERS.

06:59.959 --> 07:02.583
LISTEN, PACEY!
I'M NOT GAY!

07:07.750 --> 07:09.250
Bodie: YOU'RE WAFFLING.
WE ALREADY AGREED ON THIS.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.542
IT'S MUTILATION.

07:11.542 --> 07:14.750
STUDIES SHOW
THE TRAUMA OF HAVING
YOUR GENITALS SLICED

07:14.750 --> 07:16.792
CAN HAVE A LASTING
EFFECT INTO ADULTHOOD.

07:16.792 --> 07:19.417
TRUST ME. IF I WAS
CONSCIOUS OF IT,

07:19.417 --> 07:21.125
I'D MOST DEFINITELY
REMEMBER.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.583
YOU KNOW, JUNIOR'S FORESKIN
WILL BE A NON-ISSUE

07:23.583 --> 07:25.875
IF WE ALL BLOW AWAY
IN A TYPHOON.

07:25.875 --> 07:28.667
IT'S JUST A WARNING.
THESE THINGS NEVER
COME THIS FAR NORTH.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.375
WELL, I VOTE WE GO
TO DAWSON'S.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.792

DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
THIS KID--PFFT--IS BEING
CIRCUMCISED.

07:35.834 --> 07:36.875
NO...HE'S NOT.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.166
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE PREGNANT,

07:38.166 --> 07:40.250
DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA
GET THE LAST WORD ON THIS.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.375
WATCH ME.

08:01.875 --> 08:05.291

IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, PACEY.

08:15.959 --> 08:18.959

TO HELP ME SECURE THE PLACE.

HOMEWORK COMING?

08:24.708 --> 08:27.542
I HOPE THIS BAD WEATHER'S
GIVING YOU A CHANCE
TO CATCH UP ON YOUR READING.

08:27.542 --> 08:30.834
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THE GUY'S A GOOF.

08:30.834 --> 08:33.250
HE HASN'T CRACKED A BOOK
SINCE THIRD GRADE.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.207

[THUNDERCLAP]
OH!

08:50.959 --> 08:52.917
I'M SORRY. I HATE STORMS.

08:52.917 --> 08:56.166
I--I REALLY DON'T DO WELL
AT ALL IN BAD WEATHER.

08:56.166 --> 08:59.417

SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

MORE STORMS IN MY TIME
THAN YOU CAN COUNT.

IF YOU GUYS ARE OVER
HERE WITH US.

IF THE LORD DECIDES
TO BLOW MY HOUSE AWAY,
SO BE IT.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.250
OH, GRAMS,
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,

09:18.250 --> 09:19.583
THE LORD SENT A FAX
WHILE YOU WERE OUT.

09:19.583 --> 09:21.291
SOMETHING ABOUT
THE ARMAGEDDON.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.542
HEY, STRANGER.

I HEARD YOUR GRANDPA WAS
BACK IN THE HOSPITAL.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.208
I'M SORRY.
OH, YEAH.

09:32.208 --> 09:35.917

SOME TESTS. HE'LL BE OK.

KINDA ANXIOUS, THOUGH.

09:39.542 --> 09:40.000

09:53.333 --> 09:54.542
IT'S NOT A JUDGMENT
OR ANYTHING.

09:54.542 --> 09:55.959
IT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION.

09:55.959 --> 09:57.708
DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

20:56.500 --> 20:58.917
I HAVE BEEN
WITH SOMEONE ELSE,

20:58.917 --> 21:02.500
ANOTHER MAN,

21:02.500 --> 21:05.792
HAVING SEX WITH ANOTHER MAN.

21:10.291 --> 21:13.917
NOW, I WON'T BE SO INSULTING
AS TO OFFER AN APOLOGY.

21:13.917 --> 21:16.375
THIS IS, AFTER ALL,
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF FORGIVENESS.

21:16.375 --> 21:19.542
I JUST THOUGHT THAT
YOU SHOULD KNOW, MITCH.

21:23.250 --> 21:26.166
MITCH?

21:26.166 --> 21:27.875
[THUNDER]

21:38.959 --> 21:41.291
BATTERIES.

21:43.125 --> 21:46.667
I KNEW I SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN SOME MORE
BATTERIES. DAWSON--

21:46.667 --> 21:47.959
MITCH.

21:47.959 --> 21:52.542
DAWSON, DAWSON, TAKE
THESE, UH, CANDLES
AND FLASHLIGHT

21:52.542 --> 21:54.583
INTO THE OTHER ROOM,
ALL RIGHT?

21:54.583 --> 21:56.667
NOW, WHERE IS
THAT LANTERN?

21:56.667 --> 21:58.750
I FILLED IT
WITH KEROSENE
THIS MORNING,

21:58.750 --> 21:59.500
AND NOW IT IS GONE.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.083
MITCH, PLEASE
TALK TO ME.

22:02.083 --> 22:04.542
I HAD IT IN MY HANDS,
AND NOW IT'S
DISAPPEARED.

22:04.542 --> 22:05.625
WHERE IS IT?

22:06.834 --> 22:08.750
WHERE'D IT GO?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.959
DON'T YOU CRY!

22:17.333 --> 22:18.625
YOU DON'T GET TO CRY.

22:25.125 --> 22:27.333
[SOBBING]

22:32.125 --> 22:33.667
IS EVERYTHING OK?

22:35.875 --> 22:37.333
OH, YEAH,
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

22:37.333 --> 22:41.083
UM, I THINK
THERE'S SOME MORE
CANDLES UPSTAIRS.

22:45.291 --> 22:47.667
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE
SUCH A CLUMSY IDIOT.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.083
TAMMY, I AM REALLY
SORRY ABOUT MY BROTHER.

22:50.083 --> 22:53.667
WE'VE HAD TO PUT UP WITH
THIS PINHEAD IMBECILE
FOR YEARS NOW.

22:53.667 --> 22:56.166
HE'S KIND OF THE FAMILY
EMBARRASSMENT, YOU KNOW.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.208
I'M REALLY SORRY.

22:57.208 --> 22:58.375
IT'S OK, DOUG.

22:58.375 --> 23:01.208
REALLY, IT WAS MY FAULT.
I RAN INTO HIM.

23:01.208 --> 23:02.583
I'M THE CLUMSY ONE.

23:02.583 --> 23:04.291
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

23:04.291 --> 23:06.917
OH, JUST SOME POSSIBLE
RIDING-OUT-THE-STORM
ENTERTAINMENT.

23:06.917 --> 23:09.208
WELL, HAVE YOU EVER
PLAYED THE IF GAME?

23:09.208 --> 23:10.500
NO. HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

23:10.500 --> 23:12.834
OH, IT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

23:12.834 --> 23:15.041
UH, I ASK YOU
A QUESTION LIKE

23:15.041 --> 23:17.834
IF YOU COULD ONLY EAT
ONE FOOD FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE,

23:17.834 --> 23:18.875
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

23:18.875 --> 23:21.333
AND THEN YOU ANSWER
AND ASK ME SOMETHING.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.625
OK. WHO'S FIRST?

23:22.625 --> 23:25.083
I VOTE FOR MONOPOLY.
THAT GAME
HAS A POINT.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.875
IT'S JUST
A REALLY GOOD WAY

23:26.875 --> 23:28.250
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
BETTER, THAT'S ALL.

23:28.250 --> 23:30.917
ALL RIGHT,
LET ME SEE.

23:30.917 --> 23:33.542
UM, IF YOU HAD
TO PICK ONE CITY

23:33.542 --> 23:35.333
THAT YOU HAD TO LIVE IN
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

23:35.333 --> 23:37.708
WHAT CITY WOULD YOU PICK?

23:37.708 --> 23:38.917
EASY. NEW YORK,

23:38.917 --> 23:40.166
MY HOMETOWN.

23:40.166 --> 23:41.750
NO OTHER PLACE
LIKE IT.

23:41.750 --> 23:42.917
SO WHY'D YOU MOVE?

23:42.917 --> 23:46.792
UH, WELL, BECAUSE
I NEEDED A CHANGE.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.708
I HAVE A DYSFUNCTIONAL
EX-HUSBAND,

23:48.708 --> 23:52.291
AND NEW YORK
WASN'T BIG ENOUGH
FOR THE 2 OF US.

23:52.291 --> 23:54.291
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU,
IF I WAS YOUR EX-HUSBAND,

23:54.291 --> 23:57.000
I'D BE FULL OF REGRET
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

23:58.917 --> 24:01.375
OK. MY TURN.

24:01.375 --> 24:04.166
DOUGIE, IF YOU
COULD STAR IN ANY
BROADWAY MUSICAL,

24:04.166 --> 24:05.500
WHICH ONE WOULD
YOU CHOOSE?

24:05.500 --> 24:07.125
EASY.

24:07.125 --> 24:08.542
TONY. WEST SIDE STORY.

24:08.542 --> 24:09.834
I LOVE THAT.

24:09.834 --> 24:11.041
YEAH?
SOMEWHERE...

24:11.041 --> 24:12.750
IS MY FAVORITE.
IT'S MINE, TOO.

24:12.750 --> 24:15.083
I MUST HAVE WATCHED
THAT MOVIE TEN TIMES
WHEN I WAS A KID.

24:15.083 --> 24:16.583
TEN TIMES?
TRY FIFTEEN!

24:16.583 --> 24:19.291
A MILLION BABIES ARE
CIRCUMCISED EVERY YEAR.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.834
IT'S A HUMAN RIGHTS
ISSUE.

24:21.834 --> 24:25.250
IT'S A HARSH AND
BARBARIC EXAMPLE
OF CHILD ABUSE.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.583
Bodie: WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF IT'S GOING
TO BE A GIRL OR BOY.

24:27.583 --> 24:28.625
OR BLACK OR WHITE.

24:28.625 --> 24:30.834
WHOO. SHE'S OFF
AND RUNNING.

24:30.834 --> 24:32.041
BODIE, DON'T.

24:32.041 --> 24:33.708
IT'S NOT A JUDGMENT, BODIE.
JUST AN OBSERVATION.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.959
WHICH DO YOU OBJECT
TO MORE, MRS. RYAN--

24:35.959 --> 24:38.417
THE FACT THAT I'M BLACK
AND SHE'S WHITE

24:38.417 --> 24:41.208
OR THAT WE'RE UNMARRIED AND
ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD IN SIN?

24:41.208 --> 24:42.542
WHAT I OBJECT TO
MOST, BODIE,

24:42.542 --> 24:45.667
IS WHEN CHILDREN
RAISE CHILDREN.

24:45.667 --> 24:47.708
GET READY, BODIE.

24:47.708 --> 24:50.375
THAT CHILD WILL BE
IDENTIFIED AS DIFFERENT.

24:50.375 --> 24:51.583
PART BLACK,
PART WHITE,

24:51.583 --> 24:53.333
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
MRS. RYAN.

24:53.333 --> 24:57.208
THIS CHILD
WILL BE 100% LOVED.

25:09.125 --> 25:11.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?
IT'S PRETTY COLD.

25:11.667 --> 25:14.000
IT'S PRETTY COLD IN THERE,
TOO.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.583
I JUST NEED
A LITTLE BREAK.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.333
SO WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

25:19.333 --> 25:23.083
JUST WATCHING MR. LEERY.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.959
I GUESS THE...
[THUNDERCLAP]

25:27.959 --> 25:29.667
REALLY HIT THE FAN TODAY.

25:29.667 --> 25:31.208
SO WHERE'S DAWSON?

25:31.208 --> 25:32.834
DON'T KNOW.
DON'T CARE.

25:32.834 --> 25:34.375
I'M TAKING A BREAK.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.000
YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST AN EGO THING.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.166
I MEAN, "HOW COULD THERE
POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ANYONE
BEFORE ME?

25:39.166 --> 25:41.500
HOW CAN I MEASURE UP?"

25:41.500 --> 25:42.625
IS HE REALLY THAT TRITE?

25:42.625 --> 25:43.875
I'M SURE THERE'S
A MEASURING TAPE

25:43.875 --> 25:46.500
SITTING IN HIS BATHROOM
RIGHT NOW.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT'S MARKED UP AT?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.166
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

25:49.166 --> 25:50.417
OH, COME ON.

25:50.417 --> 25:52.542
DO YOU THINK DAWSON'S
GOT A PISTOL OR A RIFLE?

25:52.542 --> 25:53.583
UHH...

25:53.583 --> 25:55.375
HOW WOULD I KNOW?

25:55.375 --> 25:55.834
OH, COME ON.

26:02.834 --> 26:05.208
DAWSON WAS WRONG TO SPEW
HIS ANGER AT HIS MOM ONTO YOU.

26:05.208 --> 26:07.917
SO YOU HEARD?

26:07.917 --> 26:10.417
INVOLUNTARY EAVESDROPPING.

26:10.417 --> 26:13.458
WELL,
I GUESS I'M NO LONGER
THE VIRGIN QUEEN

26:13.458 --> 26:16.041
OF DAWSON LEERY'S
HAND-HELD FANTASIES.

26:16.041 --> 26:19.208
YEAH, I THINK DAWSON'S
HAVING A LIFE-DEFINING,
TURNING POINT

26:19.208 --> 26:21.000
IN HIS LIFE RIGHT NOW.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.667
AREN'T WE ALL?

26:23.917 --> 26:25.750
YOU KNOW, TAKING
INTO CONSIDERATION

26:25.750 --> 26:28.542
HIS HEIGHT, WEIGHT,
FEET AND HAND SIZE,

26:28.542 --> 26:31.333
I'D SAY HE'S SLIGHTLY
ABOVE AVERAGE.

26:32.750 --> 26:34.667
OH, SO YOU HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

26:45.333 --> 26:47.792
CAN I HELP YOU WITH THAT?

26:47.792 --> 26:49.750
NO, IT'S FINE. I'M...
I'M FINE, THANKS.

26:53.417 --> 26:56.208
MR. RYAN USED TO SAY,

26:56.208 --> 26:57.750
"IF YOU WANT THE RAINBOW...

26:57.750 --> 26:59.417
YOU GOTTA PUT UP
WITH A LOT OF RAIN."

26:59.417 --> 27:00.959
[SIGHS]

27:00.959 --> 27:02.375
SO YOU KNOW, TOO?

27:05.250 --> 27:08.208
I USED TO BE A BIG FAN
OF MOTION PICTURES.

27:08.208 --> 27:10.291
FRANK CAPRA--

27:10.291 --> 27:11.166
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE,

27:11.166 --> 27:13.291
MR. SMITH GOES
TO WASHINGTON,

27:13.291 --> 27:14.458
POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES.

27:14.458 --> 27:20.208
SIMPLE DESIRES FULFILLED,
ASPIRATIONS REALIZED.

27:20.208 --> 27:24.625
FEARS OF ABANDONMENT TURNED
INTO FANTASY SPECTACLES
OF SECURITY AND JOY.

27:25.708 --> 27:27.458
FRANK CAPRA
AND STEVEN SPIELBERG

27:27.458 --> 27:29.917
ARE OFTEN COMPARED FOR
THEIR THEMATIC CONTENT.

27:29.917 --> 27:32.583
WHAT I LIKED MOST
ABOUT THOSE MOVIES

27:32.583 --> 27:36.959
IS THE FACT THAT NO MATTER
HOW FAR OFF THE PEDESTAL
THE CHARACTER FELL,

27:36.959 --> 27:39.250
HE ALWAYS GOT
A SECOND CHANCE.

27:39.250 --> 27:44.083
FORGIVENESS IS ONE
OF THE GREATEST GIFTS
THE LORD HAS GIVEN US.

27:44.083 --> 27:45.959
WITH IT COMES...
UNDERSTANDING.

27:49.291 --> 27:51.375
THE SAME WAY RAIN
BRINGS A RAINBOW?

27:54.291 --> 27:56.667
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN
OF YOU SO FAR,

27:56.667 --> 27:59.583
YOU BETTER BUY YOURSELF
A GOOD UMBRELLA.

28:08.708 --> 28:11.583
ST. CHARLES PLACE
WITH A HOTEL--

28:11.583 --> 28:12.500
$750.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.792
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

28:14.792 --> 28:16.834
OH, NOW, SO WHAT
ABOUT GYPSY?

28:16.834 --> 28:17.917
OH, I LOVE THAT.

28:17.917 --> 28:19.875
DID YOU SEE
THE BETTE MIDLER
TV VERSION?

28:19.875 --> 28:20.375
OH, SHE WAS GREAT.

28:20.375 --> 28:22.250
BUT, YOU KNOW,

28:22.250 --> 28:24.041
I STILL LOVE
ETHEL MERMAN.

28:24.041 --> 28:26.000
Tamara:
YEAH. A CHORUS LINE?

28:26.000 --> 28:27.708
â™ª KISS TODAY GOOD-BYE â™ª

28:27.708 --> 28:30.417
â™ª THE SWEETNESS
AND THE SORROW â™ª

28:30.417 --> 28:31.875
IT'S YOUR TURN.

28:31.875 --> 28:33.333
OH.

28:33.333 --> 28:34.542
LISTEN, TAMARA,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
GO OUT WITH ME SOMETIME,

28:34.542 --> 28:36.959
MAYBE CATCH A MOVIE?

28:36.959 --> 28:38.875
THE RIALTO'S GOT THIS
WHOLE OLDIES CLASSICS THING

28:38.875 --> 28:39.875
ON WEDNESDAY NIGHTS.

28:39.875 --> 28:42.291
THEY PLAY A LOT OF
THE OLD MGM MUSICALS.

28:42.291 --> 28:43.291
IT'S REALLY GREAT.

28:43.291 --> 28:44.667
I'D LOVE TO.

28:44.667 --> 28:47.375
YEAH? GREAT. OK, WE'LL
MAKE A WHOLE NIGHT OF IT.

28:47.375 --> 28:50.875
NICE ROMANTIC DINNER,
LEAVE BABY BROTHER HERE
AT HOME.

28:50.875 --> 28:53.291
JUST GIVE US
A CHANCE TO, UH,

28:53.291 --> 28:55.542
I DON'T KNOW,
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
A LITTLE MORE INTIMATELY.

28:55.542 --> 28:57.500
YOU KNOW,
MAKE IT A REAL DATE.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.792
WELL, NOT REALLY
A REAL DATE.

28:59.792 --> 29:01.417
WHY NOT?

29:01.417 --> 29:05.667
WELL, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE I...

29:05.667 --> 29:07.041
I KNOW.

29:07.041 --> 29:08.208
IT'S NOT BECAUSE
I'M TOO YOUNG, IS IT?

29:08.208 --> 29:11.333
I MEAN, PLEASE DON'T PULL
THE AGE THING ON ME.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.500
I'M 24. SOON TO BE 25.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.000
NO, NO,
IT'S NOT THAT AT ALL.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
IT'S JUST THAT I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE...

29:18.000 --> 29:19.500
GAY.

29:20.208 --> 29:22.417
WHAT?

29:26.542 --> 29:27.625
DID YOU TELL HER
I'M GAY?

29:27.625 --> 29:30.625
Tamara: NO.
I GUESSED IT.

29:30.625 --> 29:32.667
WH-WHEN I LIVED
IN NEW YORK,

29:32.667 --> 29:34.166
I LIVED ON
CHRISTOPHER STREET.

29:34.166 --> 29:35.625
I HAVE GOOD GAYDAR.

29:37.333 --> 29:38.041
YOU TOLD HER, DIDN'T YOU?

29:38.041 --> 29:40.959
TELL HER I'M NOT GAY!

29:40.959 --> 29:42.166
SHE HAS GAYDAR.

29:42.166 --> 29:45.792
TAMARA, I AM NOT GAY.
IT'S OK TO BE GAY.

29:45.792 --> 29:47.875
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL HIM, TAMARA.

29:47.875 --> 29:50.417
ALL RIGHT. YOU TELL HER
RIGHT NOW I AM NOT GAY!

29:50.417 --> 29:52.375
GUYS, GUYS, HEY!

29:52.375 --> 29:53.417
IT'S OK, TAMARA.

29:53.417 --> 29:54.291
HE DOES THIS KIND
OF STUFF ALL THE TIME.

29:54.291 --> 29:56.291
[EXHALES]

29:56.291 --> 29:57.792
TELL HER.

29:57.792 --> 29:59.041
NOW.

30:00.959 --> 30:02.083
[WHIMPERING]

30:04.333 --> 30:06.875
OK. ALL RIGHT.

30:08.959 --> 30:10.583
HE'S NOT GAY.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.625
ALL RIGHT THEN.

30:13.625 --> 30:16.417
SO WHOSE TURN IS IT?

30:29.417 --> 30:32.000
[SHIVERING]

30:36.625 --> 30:38.917
IT'S BOB, ISN'T IT?

30:48.834 --> 30:53.959
THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU...

30:53.959 --> 30:57.750
IT WAS, UH, ON THE PIER
AT THE MARINA,

30:57.750 --> 31:01.000
AND YOU WERE WITH THAT
GIRLFRIEND OF YOURS...

31:01.000 --> 31:03.667
THE WOMAN WHO NEVER SHUT UP--
TALK, TALK, TALK ALL THE TIME.

31:03.667 --> 31:06.208
I CAN'T REMEMBER

31:06.208 --> 31:07.291
HER NAME.
IT WAS, UH...

31:07.291 --> 31:10.917
ONE OF THOSE
SOAP-OPERA NAMES,
YOU KNOW,

31:10.917 --> 31:13.417
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
ALEXIS OR DORIAN.

31:13.417 --> 31:14.500
PHOEBE.

31:14.500 --> 31:18.166
AH, PHOEBE.

31:18.166 --> 31:23.250
FROM THE MINUTE PHOEBE
INTRODUCED US, I KNEW...

31:23.250 --> 31:24.166
THAT I LOVED YOU.

31:26.959 --> 31:28.792
I MEAN, IT WAS THAT QUICK,
YOU KNOW,

31:28.792 --> 31:30.834
BECAUSE LOVE COMES
THAT QUICK.

31:30.834 --> 31:32.875
IT'S LIKE A DECISION.

31:32.875 --> 31:36.208
LOVE IS A DECISION THAT
YOU MAKE, AND I MADE IT.

31:36.208 --> 31:37.083
RIGHT THERE, ON THE SPOT.

31:44.208 --> 31:47.708
WHAT I NEED FOR YOU
TO KNOW

31:47.708 --> 31:51.792
IS THAT OUR LOVE CAME QUICK,
AND IT'S LASTED.

31:53.208 --> 31:55.667
IT'S WEATHERED THE STORM.

31:57.500 --> 32:02.125
BUT AS QUICKLY AS I MADE
THAT DECISION 20 YEARS AGO
TO LOVE YOU...

32:03.667 --> 32:06.542
I'M TAKING IT BACK.

32:06.542 --> 32:12.250
I DON'T WANT TO LOVE YOU
ANYMORE.

32:12.250 --> 32:14.333
I CHOOSE TO HATE YOU NOW.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.750
NO, MITCH, DON'T--

32:16.750 --> 32:18.792
IT'S ALREADY DONE.

32:18.792 --> 32:21.792
JUST LIKE THAT.

32:24.834 --> 32:27.834
SO I SUGGEST YOU
GET OUTTA THE CAR...

32:29.625 --> 32:32.291

REMOVE YOU FROM IT.

LOCAL RESIDENTS TODAY.

HAS TAKEN A SUDDEN DETOUR,

33:00.375 --> 33:03.792
AND IT'S LEFT ONLY
MODERATE DAMAGE TO CAPESIDE
AND ITS SURROUNDING AREAS.

33:03.792 --> 33:05.250
AND NOW THAT
THE STORM IS OVER,

33:05.250 --> 33:07.792
I GUESS IT'S TIME THAT
WE CAN ALL FINALLY SAY
GOOD-BYE

33:07.792 --> 33:09.250

BAD WEATHER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

33:15.959 --> 33:17.625

INTERESTING DAY.

33:17.625 --> 33:18.959
OH, ANYTIME.

33:18.959 --> 33:21.250

THE GUNPLAY.

HONEST WITH YOU, DOUG.

RIGHT NOW.

33:31.959 --> 33:34.458
OH. WELL,
FAIR ENOUGH.

33:34.458 --> 33:36.750

33:36.750 --> 33:37.792

THERE ARE
A FEW THINGS--

34:16.083 --> 34:18.708
OK, LOOK, JEN--
NO. HEAR ME OUT,

34:18.708 --> 34:20.417
DAWSON, PLEASE, OK?

34:20.417 --> 34:22.333
BECAUSE THIS SEEMS TO
BE THE DAY OF TRUTHS,

34:22.333 --> 34:24.417
AND I'M TAKING MY TURN.

34:24.417 --> 34:25.542
[SOB]

34:25.542 --> 34:27.291
I LOST MY VIRGINITY...

34:28.625 --> 34:32.291
WHEN I WAS 12
TO SOME OLDER GUY
WHO GOT ME DRUNK.

34:32.291 --> 34:34.041
I DON'T REALLY
REMEMBER HIS NAME,

34:34.041 --> 34:35.458
BUT AFTER THE FIRST
PREGNANCY SCARE,

34:35.458 --> 34:38.875
I WENT ON THE PILL,
AND I USED CONDOMS...

34:38.875 --> 34:43.417
MOST OF THE TIME...
SOME OF THE TIMES.

34:43.417 --> 34:44.458
UM...

34:44.458 --> 34:47.125
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S KINDA BLURRY.

34:47.125 --> 34:49.083
I WAS REALLY--
I WAS REALLY
DRINKING A LOT

34:49.083 --> 34:50.750
AND HAVING BLACKOUTS
AND STUFF AND...

34:50.750 --> 34:52.583
[SNIFFLES]

34:52.583 --> 34:55.083
[SIGHS]

34:55.083 --> 35:00.041
I WAS SEXUALIZED
WAY TOO YOUNG,

35:00.041 --> 35:02.083
AND I DON'T WISH THAT
ON ANYBODY.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.625
I MEAN, SEX
AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE

35:04.625 --> 35:07.667
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
IS A BAD IDEA.

35:09.125 --> 35:12.041
I FINALLY GOT CAUGHT
HAVING SEX IN
MY PARENTS' BED.

35:12.041 --> 35:14.917
DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL...

35:14.917 --> 35:17.417
FORNICATING RIGHT BEFORE
HIS VERY EYES.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.708
HE STILL CAN'T LOOK ME
IN THE FACE,

35:21.708 --> 35:23.000
BUT THEN AGAIN
HE SHIPPED ME
200 MILES AWAY

35:23.000 --> 35:25.417
SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

35:25.417 --> 35:29.083
BUT, DAWSON, I'M NOT
THAT GIRL ANYMORE.
I NEVER REALLY WAS.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.250
AND I'M NOT THAT
WHITE-AS-SNOW IMAGE
YOU'VE GOT, EITHER.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.583
I'M SOMEWHERE
IN-BETWEEN,

35:32.583 --> 35:36.333
AND I'M JUST--
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

35:36.333 --> 35:40.583
JEN, Y-YOU DON'T NEED--
IT'S NOT...IT'S NOT YOU, OK?

35:40.583 --> 35:42.250
IT'S MY OWN
STUPID HANGUPS.

35:43.583 --> 35:44.917
MY PARENTS HAVE
THIS RAGING SEX LIFE,

35:44.917 --> 35:49.291
AND I GUESS I SECRETLY
USED IT AS A MEASURE
OF HAPPINESS.

35:49.291 --> 35:51.667
WELL, SEX DOESN'T
EQUAL HAPPINESS.

35:51.667 --> 35:53.708
JEN, I KNOW.

35:53.708 --> 35:55.250
I KNOW THAT NOW.

35:56.417 --> 35:59.083
I'M SORRY ABOUT
LYING TO YOU.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.583
BUT I CAN'T APOLOGIZE
FOR MY PAST.

36:02.583 --> 36:03.959
I MEAN,
I'VE LEARNED FROM IT.

36:03.959 --> 36:06.667
I'M A BETTER PERSON.
IT'S GOTTEN ME HERE.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.500
AND THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO START OVER.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.166
THIS IS MY CHANCE.

36:13.166 --> 36:16.917
AND IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE
IF YOU'D BE A PART OF THAT.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.375
ON ONE CONDITION...

36:21.917 --> 36:25.875
THAT YOU'LL HAVE ME.

36:25.875 --> 36:29.333
BECAUSE, JEN, MY BEHAVIOR
HAS BEEN UNREDEEMABLE...

36:29.333 --> 36:32.667
AND I DON'T DESERVE
SOMEONE AS...

36:32.667 --> 36:36.542

AND HONEST AND BEAUTIFUL
AS YOU ARE.

OHH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?

37:00.542 --> 37:02.000

37:02.000 --> 37:04.291
IT'S LATE, PACEY.

IF QUESTION.

37:06.125 --> 37:07.458
HERE, I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

37:07.458 --> 37:12.708
IF YOU COULD DO ANY ONE THING
IN YOUR LIFE AGAIN,

37:12.708 --> 37:14.375
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

37:14.375 --> 37:17.583
WELL, I WOULDN'T HAVE
MARRIED AN ABUSIVE,
FAT STOCKBROKER.

37:19.333 --> 37:20.959

BACK AT YA.

37:20.959 --> 37:23.834
WELL, I'D BE OLDER...

37:23.834 --> 37:26.375
SO I COULD TELL THE WORLD
ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL WOMAN

37:26.375 --> 37:28.417
WHO I AM RAPIDLY
FALLING IN LOVE WITH.

37:30.625 --> 37:33.166

THAT IT WAS GOING
TO MAKE ME JEALOUS

37:33.166 --> 37:35.750
BY FLIRTING
WITH DEPUTY DOUG?

37:35.750 --> 37:37.834

I DON'T FLIRT.

37:38.417 --> 37:40.750
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,

37:40.750 --> 37:42.458
IT'S EXCEEDINGLY
UNNECESSARY.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.041
I'M ALREADY JEALOUS OF
EVERY GUY WHO'S EVER BEEN
IN YOUR FIELD OF VISION...

37:52.917 --> 37:55.917
WHO'S KNOWN
THE SMELL OF YOUR HAIR...

37:55.917 --> 37:58.250
WHO'S HELD YOUR BODY
AGAINST HIS.

WE'RE GETTING SLOPPY, PACEY.

38:02.417 --> 38:05.792

GONNA HAVE TO END THIS.
IT'S GETTING TOO DANGEROUS.

38:05.792 --> 38:07.166
UHH! BUT...

38:07.166 --> 38:09.667
TELL ME THAT ISN'T
A TURN-ON.

38:09.667 --> 38:11.041
OH, PACEY.

38:11.041 --> 38:12.291

38:12.291 --> 38:14.000
JUST ONE MORE
QUESTION.

38:15.542 --> 38:16.959
[EXHALES]

38:16.959 --> 38:20.667
IF YOU COULD DO ANY
ONE THING RIGHT NOW...

38:20.667 --> 38:22.333
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

39:13.542 --> 39:14.917

BECAUSE IF YOU THINK
IT CAN'T GET WORSE, IT CAN.

ONE DAY, MITCH,

AND I REALIZED
MY LIFE WAS PERFECT.

39:45.083 --> 39:50.667

FROM THE TIME I WAS 6
HAD BEEN REALIZED.

39:52.875 --> 39:54.959

39:54.959 --> 39:58.041

A DISCOMFORTING STATE.

39:58.041 --> 40:00.875

40:02.250 --> 40:05.083

IS JUST THE WAY YOU'VE
ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE?

40:32.041 --> 40:34.542

TO WANT AGAIN.

40:38.417 --> 40:40.875
SO...I SET OUT
TO ACHIEVE IT.

40:40.875 --> 40:42.542
