       I live my spirit.
      I nurture my truth.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.307
         I celebrate--
    what are you doing here?

00:08.309 --> 00:09.441
          - Hi there.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.076
          Yeah, I came
      to borrow some milk.

00:11.078 --> 00:12.611
   Do you have any real milk,
 like something from an animal?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.713
        - That is real.
          - Ah, okay.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.448
        - What happened
        to your asiagos?

00:16.450 --> 00:18.117
  - Well, now that my finances
         are influxed,

00:18.119 --> 00:20.352
      Richard has told me
  it's fiscally irresponsible

00:20.354 --> 00:22.187
   To have bagels messengered
  from new york every morning,

00:22.189 --> 00:26.258
     So what I'm doing here
        is I'm cooking!

00:26.260 --> 00:28.694
   - You're not busy cooking
   all day, though, are you?

00:28.696 --> 00:30.162
            I mean,
  generally you're available.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.296
  - Not to do things for you,
              no.

00:31.298 --> 00:34.333
        Look, I'm going
   through his school forms,

00:34.335 --> 00:37.302
           And I need
 an emergency contact for him.

00:37.304 --> 00:40.339
           Normally,
   I would put his dad down.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.307
   - Who lives in antarctica.
 - Which is why I'm asking you.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.542
     - Because I'm awesome
          and a hero.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.244
     - No, because you live
           next door.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.812
     - I think we both know
    it's 'cause I'm a hero.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.748
  - You understand that you'd
 have to be responsible, will?

00:49.750 --> 00:53.318
    You can't just be will,
 the fun neighbor idiot person.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.488
- Fun will and responsible will
  are one and the same, fiona.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.257
    What is it going to take
  for you to understand that?

00:58.259 --> 01:00.192
         - I'm a strong
      and independent boy.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.127
       I live my spirit.
             - Hey.

01:02.129 --> 01:03.562
        - Oh, hey, will.
  Did you hear what today is?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.397
   - "wear a woman's sweater
        to school" day?

01:05.399 --> 01:08.267
             - Pew!
          - Principal?

01:08.269 --> 01:10.736
       - No, princi-pal.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.405
       - Sweater back on!
    Sweater back on, marcus!

01:13.407 --> 01:16.141
    - Marcus has been given
       the highest honor.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.276
         - I get to be
principal goldenrod's assistant

01:17.278 --> 01:20.245
           All right,
   come on, mom, we gotta go.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.214
  We gotta go check in on the
early morning detention students

01:22.216 --> 01:25.250
   And then get in some good
 old-fashioned hall monitoring

01:25.252 --> 01:26.185
      Before first period.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.220
   Ah, I am drunk with power.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.122
           Bye, will.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.259
      - Fiona, you cannot
        let him do this.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.395
 - What are you talking about?
     It's a very big deal.

01:36.397 --> 01:39.364
      - He'll be a pariah!
     Principal's assistant?

01:39.366 --> 01:40.699
  He might as well be wearing
             a sash

01:40.701 --> 01:42.734
  That says "volunteer narc."

01:42.736 --> 01:44.536
           - You see,
 if you were responsible, will,

01:44.538 --> 01:45.871
  Really, you would appreciate

01:45.873 --> 01:50.242
   And also, don't undermine
 my parenting in front of him.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.244
    - I waited till he went
   to the car--you saw that.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.512
      - The sweater, will,
          the sweater.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.347
     For your information,
         it is unisex.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.349
  - Nothing about that sweater
      is any kind of sex!

01:57.351 --> 02:00.219
      - Will you just fill
     this form in, please?

02:00.221 --> 02:03.555
           Thank you.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.792
       - Be cool, marcus.
         Be cool, dude.

   supposed to come in here.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.273

 that brown stuff on your nose,

03:33.747 --> 03:35.380
    Or did you put it there
           yourself?

03:35.382 --> 03:38.884
 Must be from the hot chocolate
 I made the principal earlier.

03:38.886 --> 03:44.656

 cinnamon in as a fun surprise.

           about you?

04:16.290 --> 04:19.391
            - What?
   - Nothing, just that, uh,

04:19.392 --> 04:21.026
Just that you got kicked out of
    your last three schools.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.028
         That you have
      a boyfriend in jail.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.697
That you can make a teacher cry
     using only your words?

04:25.699 --> 04:28.834
       That you once ate
        a live squirrel?

04:28.836 --> 04:31.336
 - Once I ate a seventh grader
   wearing a woman's sweater.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.341
     - Just kidding, pasty.
           Calm down.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.343
      - [nervous laughter]

04:38.345 --> 04:40.779

      lame taste in music.

   Let's get some good stuff
            on here.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.316
  Do you like the sex pistols?

04:44.318 --> 04:45.717
   - Uh, those are two things

04:45.719 --> 04:47.319
     That are not permitted
        in my household.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.588
  - I think this school needs
         a dance break.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.858
          - Huh? Wait,
     that's the pa system.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.493
       If you turn it on,
  the whole school will hear--

           I did it.

05:28.329 --> 05:32.064
           It was me.

05:42.343 --> 05:46.111
  But I can't tell you I'm not
 a tiny bit proud of you, man.

I mean, clearly I'm having more
   of a positive influence--

       - I didn't do it.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.555

     that makes more sense.

   We were in the principal's
        office together,

  And she turned on the music
      and started dancing.

   It's like--it's like I was
 in a trance, I was hypnotized.

          take drugs?

06:33.594 --> 06:35.160
    That she likes you back?

06:35.162 --> 06:37.396
    - Hmm, I don't think so.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.997
           Oh, wait!
      She called me pasty.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.866
 - Okay, that's gonna be tough
        for me to spin.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.869
     Uh, what kind of vibe
    is she throwing at you?

06:43.871 --> 06:46.505
    - Huh. Oh, she's a year
         older than me.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.673
           - Mm-hmm.
  - She's possibly a criminal.

06:48.675 --> 06:51.109
    And she has a boyfriend,
   but I think he's in jail.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.445
     - Oh, oh, marcus, no,
       she's a bad girl.

  Dude, no, this is not gonna
       end well for you.

 principal goldenrod the truth?

        not tell my mom

07:13.467 --> 07:16.468
  About the whole "shea" part?

07:16.470 --> 07:20.705

anything, ever, about anything.

           - Oh. Hey.
    What are you doing here?

07:38.826 --> 07:40.759
   - They're saying I popped
       a teacher's tires.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.461
           - Did you?

07:42.463 --> 07:44.196
   - Look, it doesn't matter
         if you did it

07:44.198 --> 07:47.466
 If the man thinks you did it.

07:47.468 --> 07:50.769
    Did you get in trouble?

07:50.771 --> 07:54.039
      - Well...My mom was
          pretty mad.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.674
     - What about your dad?

07:55.676 --> 07:58.677
 - My dad lives in antarctica.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.479
      We're not in touch
       as much as I like

08:00.481 --> 08:02.547
 During penguin mating season.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.087
       - I got kicked out
    of my last two schools.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.922
           Not three.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.657
    I don't have a boyfriend
            in jail.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.126
    Can I make a teacher cry
      using only my words?

08:15.128 --> 08:16.995
             Yeah.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.764
      And, no, I never ate
        a live squirrel.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.233
      I'm an animal lover.

08:21.235 --> 08:25.604
           - Me too.

08:25.606 --> 08:30.242
         - Hi, darling.
    Hello, I'm marcus's mom.

08:30.244 --> 08:32.244
             - No.

08:32.246 --> 08:36.280
         - Yes...I am.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.650
       Come on, darling,
           let's go.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.520
          - Uh, okay.

08:41.522 --> 08:42.854
      - Don't let the man
         get you down.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.162
        - I wouldn't say
     that I'm disappointed.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.797
       - Oh, I'm so happy
         to hear that.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.300
       - I am devastated.
             - Oh.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.936
        - I am shaken to
         my very core.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.972
       In all my 30 years
        as an educator--

09:00.974 --> 09:04.309
         Nay, 50 years
       as a human being,

09:04.311 --> 09:07.913
       I have never felt
          so betrayed.

09:07.915 --> 09:11.316
           - Alan...
      May I call you alan?

09:11.318 --> 09:14.786
     We're terribly sorry.
     We are terribly sorry.

09:14.788 --> 09:18.256
    Now, why don't you tell
 principal goldenrod the truth?

09:23.863 --> 09:25.096
          - I did it!
            - What?

09:25.098 --> 09:26.831
       What, what, what?
         No you didn't!

09:26.833 --> 09:28.600
          - I did it!
        I'd do it again.

09:28.602 --> 09:32.137
   I'd do it a thousand times
   with absolutely no regret.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.738
   What do you think of that,
            the man?

09:33.740 --> 09:36.207
       I played the sex,
     I played the pistols,

09:36.209 --> 09:38.143
      I played them both.

09:50.790 --> 09:51.022
               .

09:51.024 --> 09:52.624
             - Hey!

09:52.626 --> 09:54.626
  It's 4:00 in the afternoon.
          - Hey, stop!

09:54.628 --> 09:56.127
           - Get up!
           - Stop it!

09:56.129 --> 09:58.730
   I'm trying to save money.
         - By napping?

09:58.732 --> 10:01.132
          - Yes, okay,
     it's a good strategy.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.335
     You can't spend money
    when you're unconscious.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.303
           Although,
    this one time in cabo--

10:05.305 --> 10:07.038
      - All right, listen,
        listen, listen!

10:07.040 --> 10:10.208
 I just came from an incredibly
      humiliating meeting

10:10.210 --> 10:11.743
    With marcus's principal.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.044
     Marcus was prepared to
       fall on his sword,

10:13.046 --> 10:14.346
     But I figured it out.

10:14.348 --> 10:16.181
  He's trying to protect this
         very odd girl.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.316
     - Shea garcia-miller.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.652
     - You know about shea?
    - Yeah, he has a crush.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.087
   - Why didn't you tell me?

10:22.089 --> 10:24.689
        - Because marcus
      asked for "privacy."

10:24.691 --> 10:26.391
           - He's 12.
        I'm his mother.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.994
     - Well, I'm his weird
      adult father figure,

10:28.996 --> 10:30.328
         And I need to
      have trust with him,

10:30.330 --> 10:32.364
         But I told him
    that she was a bad idea.

10:32.366 --> 10:36.368
 - Look, I have never had cause
to take such draconian measures.

10:36.370 --> 10:39.304
      But I am banning him
     from speaking to her.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.272
         - Well, that's
     a little bit drastic.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.141
  - He is very impressionable,
             will.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.976
     And you have not seen

10:44.978 --> 10:46.745
       The kind of power
     that she has over him.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.279
        She's using him.

10:48.281 --> 10:53.084
   With her sly little looks
 and her prepubescent breasts.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.853
  - I could get arrested even
     hearing you say that.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.655
         You stop that.
           - Listen.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.289
         You just gotta
    tow the line, all right?

10:58.291 --> 11:01.826
No shea, or I will ban him from
      speaking to you too.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.294
            - What?
             - Yes.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.730
   - You can't even do that.
     - Draconian measures!

11:05.732 --> 11:06.931
        - I can see him
        whenever I want!

          [door slams]

11:09.069 --> 11:10.402
     - I need to find a way
          to see her.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.737
    - I cannot support that,
            marcus.

11:12.739 --> 11:15.106
   - But, will, she likes me.

11:15.108 --> 11:18.376
  She's the first person ever
   that I have connected with

11:18.378 --> 11:20.779

      and emotional level.

          No offense.
    - None taken, my friend.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.116
  - We shared secrets, will.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.919

       never told anyone.

 First of all, your mom doesn't
   want you to see her, okay?

       Do you get that?
        And second off,

 What kind of evidence are you
     getting from this girl

11:39.800 --> 11:41.366

       You go hide behind
     that couch, right now.

       - Is marcus here?
           - No, no.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.166
    - That's weird, because
    I hacked into his phone,

12:15.168 --> 12:17.068
 And the gps said he was here.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.104

      - Also, he's hiding
       behind that chair.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.344

  Oh, this is my cool neighbor

          - Doubtful.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.252
      Wanna go somewhere?
          - Okay, no.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.254
 Marcus, you're not allowed to
          go anywhere.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.891

15:34.467 --> 15:36.334
       - You can go now.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.078
  - Quite fancy some biscuits.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.147
              Ew.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.588
      - You don't have any
      almond milk, do you?

15:59.258 --> 16:01.426
             Sorry.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.530
   - How is it possible that
        I eat and I eat,

16:05.532 --> 16:07.298
     But I just don't feel
          any better.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.033
         This has never
        happened before.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.668
       - All right, here,
  try it with chocolate milk.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.308
        - Nope. Nothing.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.078
       Ah, what is taking
            so long?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.113
  What could they possibly be
         talking about?

16:22.115 --> 16:25.049
        This is torture.
             - Yep.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.484
      - Thanks for taking
         my side, will.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.619
   - Well, about that marcus,
         you know, I--

16:28.621 --> 16:30.355
            - My mom
    just doesn't understand.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.324
      She doesn't get what
     being in love is like.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.361
      Man, it's hard to be
        a boy sometimes.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.096
   Thank goodness I have you.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.597
            - Yeah.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.599
         Well, listen,
   here's the thing, marcus.

16:41.601 --> 16:45.103
         You know, I am
       your buddy, right?

16:45.105 --> 16:46.671
   I am always gonna be there
            for you

16:46.673 --> 16:48.406
       And that is never
         gonna change.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.776
      But there's gonna be
       select situations

16:51.778 --> 16:53.311
  Where I'm gonna have to act

16:53.313 --> 16:55.613
     A little bit more like
      an adult, you know?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.115
         - But, you're
    in arrested development.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.316
   That's one of your charms.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.451
       - Luckily for you,
    I have numerous charms.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.787
So, you know, you won't miss one
    of them if they're gone.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.789
       [car door closes]
       - uh, that's her.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.759
- Okay, I want you to look sad.
 I want you to look apologetic.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.260
    I want you to look like
         you understand

17:09.262 --> 17:10.762
 The gravity of the situation,

17:10.763 --> 17:12.329
        And you're never
       gonna do it again.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.298
            - Okay.
       - What do you got?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.267
    Okay, you look like you
        have to go poop.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.435
      - That's impossible,
 I only poop on Sunday mornings

17:18.438 --> 17:20.271
       With a copy of the
    arts & leisure section.

17:20.272 --> 17:23.273
          - Ok, t.M.I.
    And also very unhealthy.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.609
Now, just relax your face, bud.
           Relax it.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.045
             - Unh!

17:27.047 --> 17:30.548
      - There you go, now,
     there you go, perfect.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.350
 - How was it? You weren't mean
       to her, were you?

17:32.352 --> 17:34.218
    You didn't yell at her,
            did you?

17:34.220 --> 17:36.254
    Was she mad? Did she say
       anything about me?

17:36.256 --> 17:38.089
     - She's not a bad kid,
            marcus.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.524
           - Exactly!

17:39.526 --> 17:41.426
   - But she is a year older
           than you,

17:41.428 --> 17:46.397
 And she is in a very different
      place than you are.

17:46.399 --> 17:50.735
   I don't want you racing to
 catch up with her, or anyone.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.604
     - What are you saying?

17:53.606 --> 17:55.673
          - That I...

17:55.675 --> 17:57.575
        I don't want you
     hanging out with shea.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.710
           - Mom, no!
    That's not fair, please!

17:59.712 --> 18:01.479
      - I don't expect you
         to understand.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.281
            Really.

18:03.283 --> 18:06.717
 But I'm only doing it because
    of how much I love you.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.220
            - Will?

18:09.222 --> 18:11.856
        - Sorry, buddy.
    What your mom says goes.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.363
     - Better go back home,
       do your homework,

18:19.365 --> 18:22.533
        And maybe write
        an apology poem

18:22.535 --> 18:25.770
    To principal goldenrod.

18:28.474 --> 18:31.742
            - Poem?
    - Doesn't have to rhyme.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.884
      - Hey, fiona, I, uh,

18:39.886 --> 18:43.387
   I just, you know, want you
       to know that I...

18:43.389 --> 18:46.824
 It means a lot to me that I'm
  marcus's emergency contact.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.659
    It's not something that
        I take lightly.

18:52.364 --> 18:55.433
 - I know I make it look easy,

18:55.435 --> 18:58.202
   But parenting is actually
        quite difficult.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.671
            - Yeah,
  you don't make it look easy.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.307
 - I didn't have great parents,
            myself.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.610
     I always promised that
      I'd do a better job.

19:07.513 --> 19:11.415
      You think parenting
  is gonna be black and white.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.484
 But it's actually quite gray.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.590
    - Yeah, well, that's why
 they invented whiskey, right?

19:19.592 --> 19:21.292
            - Right.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.395
  - I got a seventeen-year-old
       macallan in there.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.563
        It's been around
      longer than marcus.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.833
       Do you want some?
     - Ooh, need not want.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.570
       - Quick question.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.472
        I'm not too old
     to wear skinny jeans?

19:34.474 --> 19:35.806
       I mean, I totally
     pull them off, right?

19:35.808 --> 19:37.508
          - Oh, yeah.
          Yeah, yeah.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.879
        - What the hell?

19:41.881 --> 19:44.882
             I know
    I just saw it yesterday.

19:44.884 --> 19:48.286
  I know I have this whiskey.
       Am I going crazy?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.688
        The only people
  that have been in this house

19:50.690 --> 19:53.691
      Are you, me, marcus,
             and...

19:53.693 --> 19:55.760
            Oh, boy.
