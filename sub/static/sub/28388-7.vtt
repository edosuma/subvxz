WEBVTT

00:04.174 --> 00:07.365
Oh! See?
New posters!

00:07.413 --> 00:09.149
We never had those
underwater!

00:11.678 --> 00:13.707
I won't keep you in
suspense any longer.

00:13.795 --> 00:16.137
We're bringing one of
Ponyville's oldest traditions

00:16.225 --> 00:18.514
to our school!
The Fetlock Fete.

00:18.717 --> 00:20.026
The what-lock-what?

00:20.113 --> 00:22.897
It's a pony dance party!
They're the best.

00:23.030 --> 00:24.065
I'm ready.

00:26.295 --> 00:28.481
You don't need to
do that, Ocellus.

00:28.569 --> 00:30.254
This year, the
event's at school

00:30.342 --> 00:32.072
and open to everycreature.

00:32.159 --> 00:34.786
We're calling our
dance the "Amity Ball".

00:34.874 --> 00:36.161
Even better!

00:37.897 --> 00:40.981
Yona not know
"Amity Ball" dance.

00:41.068 --> 00:43.717
Yona only know traditional
dance of Yakyakistan.

00:43.805 --> 00:44.805
Go like this.

00:48.032 --> 00:49.426
Ball dance like that?

00:52.279 --> 00:55.061
Not exactly. It isn't
just one dance;

00:55.148 --> 00:58.866
it's a whole night of 'em!
Plus an awesome party!

00:58.995 --> 01:01.400
And we'll have all the old
Fetlock Fete traditions!

01:01.488 --> 01:03.030
The Pony-Pal contest,

01:03.118 --> 01:05.022
the Lucky Pot Dinner...
You'll love it!

01:05.131 --> 01:09.085
So like this says, "Get your
Pony-Pal and come along!"

01:09.262 --> 01:11.475
Wanna go? I got
nothing better to do.

01:11.585 --> 01:14.303
You had me at "Dinner."

01:15.944 --> 01:18.435
Now, who wants to help
me hang more posters?

01:18.523 --> 01:20.413
ME!
Sure!

01:24.511 --> 01:27.494
Hey Yona, want to
be my Pony-Pal?

01:27.632 --> 01:29.929
We can enter the
contest together.

01:30.108 --> 01:33.015
But Yona yak.
Yona not pony.

01:33.123 --> 01:34.296
So?

01:34.429 --> 01:37.203
Pony. Pony. More Pony.

01:37.290 --> 01:38.906
Aw, that's just a poster.

01:39.023 --> 01:42.367
C'mon, it'll be tons of
fun together! Promise.

01:42.757 --> 01:45.195
OK. Yona go with Sandbar.

01:45.365 --> 01:48.554
Great! I'll get the
tickets. See you later!

01:48.663 --> 01:50.183
Ha ha ha ha!

01:50.270 --> 01:54.968
Yona not let Sandbar down!
Yak best at being Pony-pal!

01:55.548 --> 01:59.695
But Yona not sure
how if she not pony.

02:01.273 --> 02:03.810
Oh! Terribly sorry, Yona.

02:03.898 --> 02:05.700
All these dresses I'm
sewing for the dance

02:05.788 --> 02:08.170
have me completely frazzled!

02:08.374 --> 02:11.571
Dress? Yona need
dress for dance?

02:11.687 --> 02:15.601
Yona have lots to learn
about being best Pony-Pal.

02:57.256 --> 02:59.099
Yona interrupting?

02:59.272 --> 03:02.288
Oh! Ha ha! Well, not
interrupting exactly.

03:02.375 --> 03:03.911
More like blocking the flow...

03:03.999 --> 03:05.599
stopping me
from what I'm doing.

03:05.687 --> 03:07.484
So, yes, interrupting.

03:07.572 --> 03:08.450
Ha ha.

03:08.538 --> 03:10.897
Now... what can I
do for you, Yona?

03:11.117 --> 03:14.411
Yona not know yak need
special pony dress for dance.

03:14.499 --> 03:17.140
Yona no can wear what
Yona always wear?

03:17.546 --> 03:19.982
Yona could. I
mean, you could.

03:20.070 --> 03:21.405
But the Fetlock Fete,

03:21.493 --> 03:23.474
or whatever
Twilight is calling it,

03:23.562 --> 03:25.210
it's all about a tradition.

03:25.312 --> 03:28.347
There's a certain way to do
everything at the dance.

03:28.434 --> 03:30.716
Yes! That what
Yona want to learn.

03:30.803 --> 03:35.654
How to do all the Pony things.
Even if Yona has to wear dress.

03:35.741 --> 03:39.202
Well, if that's
what you really want.

03:39.290 --> 03:43.421
Mm hm! Yona be best
Pony-pal for Sandbar!

03:44.562 --> 03:48.500
In that case, at an elegant
affair like a Pony dance,

03:48.587 --> 03:52.037
one must converse in a
sophisticated fashion.

03:52.124 --> 03:54.163
Talking with Brussels
sprouts in your mouth

03:54.288 --> 03:57.452
helps you learn to articulate.

03:57.596 --> 04:01.046
Take a mouthful and
repeat after me.

04:01.467 --> 04:04.749
"How kind of you
to ask me to tea!"

04:08.468 --> 04:11.623
"May I offer you
a glass of punch?"

04:15.367 --> 04:18.640
"The weather is quite
agreeable today."

04:26.859 --> 04:29.875
Yona like Brussels sprouts.

04:30.016 --> 04:31.398
Let's move on.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.679
We will need to do something
about your hair style,

04:34.767 --> 04:38.359
but first, let's
find the right dress.

04:39.202 --> 04:42.810
Now... purple taffeta,
frosted chiffon,

04:42.898 --> 04:46.392
gold brocade,
one of my favorites.

04:46.479 --> 04:48.627
Yona like brown.

04:48.714 --> 04:52.998
Earth tones. They're so...
earthy, aren't they?

04:53.124 --> 04:54.533
Don't worry; we
shall find something

04:54.620 --> 04:56.202

04:56.290 --> 04:59.473

04:59.679 --> 05:02.716

Oh, Yona already
have Pony-Pal.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.128
Oh, not that, darling.
The DANCING!

07:04.216 --> 07:06.984
And I know precisely
who can help.

07:09.960 --> 07:13.999
Uh, Rainbow Dash and
Fluttershy good at dancing?

07:14.191 --> 07:18.041
Don't be so surprised! I'm
awesome at EVERYTHING!

07:18.230 --> 07:19.898
Except for baking.

07:20.031 --> 07:21.859
There are two traditional dances

07:21.947 --> 07:23.906
that everypony does at the Fete.

07:23.994 --> 07:25.755
After a few days of
practicing with us,

07:25.843 --> 07:27.152
you'll know them both.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.601
And fit right in!

07:28.689 --> 07:31.172
Absolutely. We'll start
with the slow dance.

07:31.377 --> 07:34.913
The Pony Cotillion. That's
Fluttershy's specialty.

07:35.124 --> 07:38.968
Oh, I wouldn't say
specialty; it's just fun!

07:39.184 --> 07:41.820
Here, Yona. I made you a chart.

07:43.655 --> 07:46.371
All you have to do is
follow these dance steps.

07:46.527 --> 07:48.226
You'll learn
them in no time.

07:51.937 --> 07:53.852
Now. Just start walking.

07:57.753 --> 08:00.757
Step on whatever color
I name. Let's begin.

08:00.915 --> 08:04.565
Blue. Red. Step ahead
Green, black, now step back.

08:04.683 --> 08:06.264
Now you
try!

08:06.445 --> 08:10.507
Blue. Red. Step... Oop.
No. Yona start over.

08:10.601 --> 08:11.624
Blue, red,

08:11.712 --> 08:13.888
Green, black...
Yak step back?

08:13.976 --> 08:15.701
Good! Now...

08:15.788 --> 08:17.646
Black, green, red and blue.

08:17.734 --> 08:19.406
Red, black, hold one and two...

08:19.531 --> 08:21.302
Red. Blue. Red
once more.

08:21.390 --> 08:23.318
Green black blue
red three and four!

08:23.406 --> 08:24.499
Agh!

08:24.587 --> 08:27.171
Yona feel like she
have four front feet!

08:32.842 --> 08:36.433
Um, maybe we should
try this again later.

08:36.522 --> 08:39.722
Don't worry, Yona!
That was the hard one!

08:39.878 --> 08:41.871
Mine's WAY easier.

08:46.580 --> 08:49.122
A little dance called
the "Pony-Prance."

08:49.258 --> 08:51.409
The key to this one is SPEED!

08:56.526 --> 08:58.176
Come on, Yona! Try it!

08:58.264 --> 09:01.881
Just get with the flow
and let yourself GO!

09:09.921 --> 09:11.426
Oh, my!

09:11.766 --> 09:13.377
Whoa, there!

09:15.781 --> 09:18.296
Yona LIKE to flow and go!

09:20.000 --> 09:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:27.426 --> 09:29.723
Welcome to Sweet
Apple Acres, Yona!

09:29.817 --> 09:31.239
Rarity tells us
ya need some help

09:31.327 --> 09:32.737
getting ready for
the big dance.

09:32.825 --> 09:36.408
SOME! Ha! Indeed. And we only
have a few more days.

09:36.558 --> 09:38.583
Well, you've come
to the right place!

09:38.671 --> 09:40.859
Because if you ask me what my
favorite part of the dance is,

09:40.946 --> 09:45.130
I'd say everything about the
dance, but especially... this!

09:45.444 --> 09:47.825
The Fetlock Lucky
Pot Dinner!

09:47.913 --> 09:49.928
It's part of the
Ponyville dance tradition.

09:50.115 --> 09:52.051
Everypony brings
a dish to share,

09:52.175 --> 09:54.257
and we swap 'em without
knowin' whose is whose.

09:54.345 --> 09:57.254
Although my Lucky Pot
probably gives me away.

09:57.456 --> 09:59.629
You can cook
anything you want!

09:59.717 --> 10:03.708
But can I suggest... oh, I
don't know maybe cupcakes?

10:03.928 --> 10:06.997
I already told Yona a little
bit about that tradition.

10:07.085 --> 10:09.413
She's even brought her
own Lucky... bucket.

10:09.501 --> 10:12.017
Yak buckets are best buckets.

10:12.105 --> 10:15.138
Yona think make
traditional Yak dish.

10:15.411 --> 10:16.903
Tree Root Stew.

10:18.023 --> 10:21.373
Extra fiber! Mmm!
Ponies like?

10:21.667 --> 10:22.672
I'm not sure.

10:22.760 --> 10:26.830
So, just in case,
let's get baking!

10:29.288 --> 10:30.868
Flour, milk, sugar,
butter icing.

10:30.956 --> 10:32.871
Then we mix and we beat
and we pour into pans

10:32.958 --> 10:33.994
and we bake!

10:34.933 --> 10:36.307
And now YOU try it!

10:39.131 --> 10:40.619
Achoo!

10:41.500 --> 10:43.315
Well, that's one way to mix it.

10:43.402 --> 10:45.776
Let's try something
a little simpler.

10:45.864 --> 10:47.846
I'm sure we can do
something with these.

10:50.172 --> 10:53.401
OK! Applesauce it is.

10:54.616 --> 10:57.924
Blue... red... green... blue.

11:21.855 --> 11:25.289
How kind of you
to ask me to tea!

11:34.381 --> 11:39.480
How kind of you
to ask me to tea!

11:46.231 --> 11:47.966
Blue. Red. Step ahead.

11:48.054 --> 11:52.072
How kind of you. Green,
black, Yona step back.

11:52.185 --> 11:54.300
...to ask Yona to tea.

11:54.441 --> 11:56.279
Black, green, red and blue.

11:56.404 --> 11:58.323
Red, black, hold one and two.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.251
Red. Blue. Red once more.

12:00.339 --> 12:02.227
Green black blue
red three and four!

12:02.314 --> 12:05.081
Look! She's dancing!

12:05.169 --> 12:08.218
How 'bout that?
And she's good!

12:08.306 --> 12:11.688
Yona! If someone at the party
tells you they're thirsty,

12:11.776 --> 12:12.909
you say...?

12:12.997 --> 12:19.283
May Yona, um, may I
offer you a cup of punch?

12:19.531 --> 12:21.513
By Celestia, I
think she's got it!

12:21.600 --> 12:23.448
She's really got it!

12:23.535 --> 12:25.183
Yona, you did it!

12:25.270 --> 12:27.118
You dance great!

12:27.205 --> 12:29.521
And are so well-spoken!

12:29.608 --> 12:32.063
You'll be the hit of the Ball!

12:32.151 --> 12:35.790

so many pony ways ♪

12:35.948 --> 12:39.497

Hello, everycreature! I'm
your DJ Scales N' Tail,

12:57.603 --> 13:00.057
spinning your favorite
tunes all night long.

13:00.145 --> 13:04.119
So welcome to the Fetlock
Fe--I mean, the Amity Ball!

13:14.954 --> 13:17.903
I'm just glad I'm
here with you guys.

13:17.991 --> 13:20.537
At least I'm not the only
non-pony in the crowd.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.674
You're not still worried
about that, are you?

13:22.761 --> 13:24.643
Like Headmare Twilight said,

13:24.730 --> 13:27.012
This is a dance
for everycreature.

13:27.099 --> 13:28.799
There's no
"pony pressure."

13:31.415 --> 13:33.782
You should have
told Yona that.

13:33.870 --> 13:34.951
What do you mean?

13:35.039 --> 13:36.187
Didn't you hear?

13:36.275 --> 13:39.057
Our teachers have been helping
her get ready for the dance.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.967
She's been taking lessons.

13:42.896 --> 13:45.396
She's gone full
pony for the dance.

13:45.484 --> 13:46.547
All for you.

13:47.519 --> 13:50.057
For me? Why?

13:50.186 --> 13:55.057
How kind of you to ask me
to this soiree, Sandbar.

14:01.635 --> 14:02.347
What?

14:02.434 --> 14:04.282
You look
so... weird!

14:04.369 --> 14:05.502
Yona?

14:05.590 --> 14:10.525
Quite. Oh, I do hope I make
a good pony-pal for you.

14:11.509 --> 14:13.572
Of course you do!

14:13.660 --> 14:17.478
But Yona, you didn't need
to do any of... this.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.948
And why are you
talking so funny?

14:20.175 --> 14:25.197
I am not talking
funny. I'm fitting in.

14:25.430 --> 14:26.878
Could've fooled me.

14:26.966 --> 14:31.508
Yona! You look absolutely
scrumptious, darling!

14:32.965 --> 14:34.603
Why don't I get that for you?

14:37.587 --> 14:39.268
You made a
Lucky Pot?

14:39.356 --> 14:42.272
Precisely like ponies prepare!

14:43.262 --> 14:45.244
Welcome, everycreature
to our school's

14:45.332 --> 14:48.081
first annual Amity Ball!

14:48.169 --> 14:50.643
For those of you who've never
attended a Fetlock Fete,

14:50.731 --> 14:53.246
we can't wait to show you
some of our fun traditions

14:53.351 --> 14:54.666
on this special night.

14:57.549 --> 14:59.236
So Spike.

14:59.324 --> 15:00.963
Scales N' Tail.

15:01.051 --> 15:06.170
Uh, right. Scales N' Tail.
Let's get this party started!

15:06.736 --> 15:11.583
Oh, yeah, party ponies! It's
time to raise the roof

15:11.670 --> 15:14.648
and stomp your hoof for the
traditional first dance

15:14.736 --> 15:17.846
of the night... the
Pony Cotillion.

15:26.198 --> 15:28.399
Ah! Yona know this one.

15:28.487 --> 15:29.768
You do?

15:29.855 --> 15:34.713
Indeed! Green, black,
then step back. Shall we?

15:39.231 --> 15:40.564
Hee hee!

15:43.861 --> 15:46.439
Wow! How did you learn this?

15:46.819 --> 15:49.447
I had good teachers.

15:51.359 --> 15:52.589
Whoa!

15:55.280 --> 15:58.088
Yona! Are you all right?

15:58.176 --> 16:00.596
Yona never practice
dance with dress on.

16:00.684 --> 16:06.705
I mean... heh, heh, may I offer
you a cup of punch?

16:07.762 --> 16:10.049
Time to shake
things up a little!

16:10.137 --> 16:14.002
That's right, everycreature,
it's the Pony Prance!

16:15.934 --> 16:18.015
Maybe we should
sit this one out.

16:18.103 --> 16:21.812
No! I do so LOVE
the Pony Prance!

16:21.900 --> 16:23.088
Whoa!

16:46.731 --> 16:48.113
Whoa!

16:48.200 --> 16:49.514
It's OK, Yona!

16:49.601 --> 16:50.849
Just stop bouncing!

16:50.936 --> 16:52.217
We got you!

16:55.507 --> 16:58.156
ARGH! Wig... come... OFF!

16:58.243 --> 16:59.243
Huh?

17:07.233 --> 17:08.532
Ah!

17:09.460 --> 17:11.896
What a calamitous Yakciddent!

17:13.396 --> 17:14.505
Yona!

17:14.593 --> 17:15.473
What happened?

17:15.560 --> 17:16.851
Are you all right?

17:17.051 --> 17:22.779
No! Yona not all right.
Yona want to be alone!

17:33.902 --> 17:40.601
Yona sad. Yona sing
sad song. Sad Yona.

17:42.298 --> 17:44.003
Yona no blame bird.

17:44.091 --> 17:47.312
Yona no want to be
around Yona either.

17:47.791 --> 17:53.243
Yona sad, Yona sing sad song.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.595
Yona?

18:01.473 --> 18:03.522
How Sandbar find Yona?

18:03.704 --> 18:06.895
I know you pretty well by now.
I figured you'd come here.

18:06.983 --> 18:08.660
Besides, it's
where I'd go

18:08.747 --> 18:10.240
if something like
that happened to me.

18:10.333 --> 18:13.482
Sandbar mean something
awful and embarrassing.

18:13.632 --> 18:17.490
So awful, Yona cannot come
down from treehouse ever.

18:19.143 --> 18:21.491
Will Sandbar bring
Yona food and water?

18:21.726 --> 18:24.084
You know, it really
wasn't that bad.

18:24.172 --> 18:26.733
I don't think anycreature
hardly even noticed.

18:28.051 --> 18:30.459
Well, maybe one
or two didn't.

18:30.584 --> 18:32.533
If they happened to be in
Canterlot for the day.

18:32.738 --> 18:34.453
But anyway, it's
all over now.

18:34.541 --> 18:37.170
So, will you come back
to the dance with me?

18:39.565 --> 18:43.381
Yona disappoint Sandbar.
Yona not make very good pony.

18:43.531 --> 18:45.646
Why would you think
you disappointed me?

18:45.734 --> 18:48.631
And who said anything about
having to be a good pony?

18:48.762 --> 18:51.702
Yona just want to do all
the right pony things

18:51.790 --> 18:53.467
and fit in at dance.

18:53.555 --> 18:57.498
Then maybe Sandbar and Yona
win Best Pony-pals Contest.

18:57.818 --> 19:00.600
Instead, Yona win
Worst Pony Ever.

19:02.217 --> 19:03.553
That's not true.

19:03.641 --> 19:06.717
Really? Sandbar name two
ponies worse than Yona.

19:06.805 --> 19:08.522
Cozy Glow and Sombra.

19:08.632 --> 19:11.943
OK. Sandbar right.
They worse.

19:12.062 --> 19:14.510
Yona, it doesn't really
matter if you're a great pony

19:14.598 --> 19:18.482
or a horrible pony.
You're the best YONA I know.

19:18.695 --> 19:20.990
That's why I asked
you to the dance.

19:21.359 --> 19:22.483
Really?

19:22.571 --> 19:24.137
I never wanted you
to be anything

19:24.225 --> 19:25.381
other than
what you are.

19:25.469 --> 19:28.819
My friend,
Yona the Yak.

19:29.187 --> 19:30.234
Agh!

19:30.890 --> 19:34.507
So, what do you say? Let's
go back to the dance?

19:46.759 --> 19:48.709
Don't worry.
I'm with you.

19:50.388 --> 19:51.787
We ALL are.

19:52.021 --> 19:54.412
Yona, are
you all right?

19:54.500 --> 19:57.282
We were so worried when
you disappeared like that!

19:57.370 --> 20:00.620
Yona fine. But Yona sorry.

20:00.708 --> 20:04.146
Not mean to make such a mess
and ruin the pony dance.

20:04.477 --> 20:06.381
It's not your fault, Sugarcube.

20:06.469 --> 20:07.850
It's the opposite!

20:07.993 --> 20:10.743
If anything, we
should be apologizing.

20:10.869 --> 20:12.050
I thought we were
just teaching you

20:12.137 --> 20:14.068
how to have fun at the dance.

20:14.164 --> 20:17.414
We never meant to try to turn
you into something you're not.

20:17.876 --> 20:18.935
Is OK.

20:19.122 --> 20:21.436
Friend help Yona feel better.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.394
And that's why we're
giving you this.

20:25.750 --> 20:28.672
No way! The Pony-Pal Prize!

20:28.895 --> 20:31.768
From now on, it's the
Annual Amity Ball Award

20:31.856 --> 20:32.804
for Friendship.

20:32.891 --> 20:34.750
No pony-ness required.

20:34.844 --> 20:38.508
We all decided that you and
Yona totally earned this.

20:39.686 --> 20:41.011
Your actions tonight

20:41.099 --> 20:43.907
exemplified the true
meaning of friendship.

20:45.142 --> 20:47.090
Congratulations, you two.

20:52.838 --> 20:55.821
Yona! I'm glad you're back.

20:55.909 --> 20:58.813
Everypony wants to learn
that crazy dance you did!

20:59.715 --> 21:02.664
Yak-Dance?
Is easy. Yona teach.

21:02.821 --> 21:05.461
If everycreature
want to learn?

21:05.657 --> 21:07.243
It would be an honor.

21:08.351 --> 21:11.740
You asked for it and
DJ Scales N' Tail

21:11.828 --> 21:13.144
is gonna deliver!

21:13.231 --> 21:17.782
Everycreature join Yona for...
the Yakyakistan Stomp!
