[Michelangelo humming]

00:24.455 --> 00:26.523
[British accent)
Hmm, I do believe this plutonium

00:26.525 --> 00:29.626
should react flawlessly
with the sodium bicarbonates.

00:29.628 --> 00:32.829
What do you think,
Professor Ice Cream Kitty?

00:32.831 --> 00:34.731
[meows]

00:34.733 --> 00:37.901
Then perhaps we should add
this hyperbole solution

00:37.903 --> 00:40.637
to Donnie's Retro-Mutagen.

00:40.639 --> 00:41.738
Mikey?

00:41.740 --> 00:43.573
Have you lost your shell?!

00:43.575 --> 00:45.609
Pishposh and tut-tut,
my good man!

00:45.611 --> 00:48.745
I've been brewing that
Retro-Mutagen for months!

00:48.747 --> 00:51.715
Oh, if you've ruined it,
I swear I'll--

00:51.717 --> 00:54.084
Hold on dude,
I got this!

00:54.086 --> 00:56.987
[both grunting and groaning]

00:56.989 --> 01:00.590
Aah!

01:04.061 --> 01:06.863
Phew.

01:09.433 --> 01:12.035
Oh.
Oh no, Mikey!

- Now, you listen to me!
- No! You listen to me!

02:42.361 --> 02:45.929
I am gonna teach you
such a lesson! I--

02:45.931 --> 02:47.030
Ooh! Aah!

02:47.032 --> 02:50.300
What is going on in here?

02:50.302 --> 02:55.205
Since when did Retro-Mutagen
start doing that?

03:01.212 --> 03:04.447
(Donatello) Wow!
Its bonding rate is phenomenal.

03:04.449 --> 03:05.849
Haha, I can't believe it!

03:05.851 --> 03:08.118
This will save me months
of lab work!

03:08.120 --> 03:09.252
Okay, let me see.

03:09.254 --> 03:10.954
One small drop

03:10.956 --> 03:14.090
and I'm able to transform
an entire vial of Mutagen

03:14.092 --> 03:15.158
into Retro-Mutagen!

03:15.160 --> 03:18.728
[laughs]
Mikey, you're amazing!

03:18.730 --> 03:19.195
I know.

03:19.197 --> 03:23.199
Wow, did we step into some kinda
alternate dimension here?

03:23.201 --> 03:25.235
Okay, what chemicals
did you use

03:25.237 --> 03:27.337
to help create
the rapid cellular bonding?!

03:27.339 --> 03:30.840
Uh, I think I added
a bunch of stuff like...

03:30.842 --> 03:34.344
uranate, anolite,
uh, moronic acid,

03:34.346 --> 03:38.748
and some, uh,
garlic-cappuccino pizza?

03:38.750 --> 03:40.417
Nope. Same dimension.

03:40.419 --> 03:42.819
Are you kidding me?

03:42.821 --> 03:44.154
You do one awesome thing,

03:44.156 --> 03:45.822
and you can't even remember
how you did it?!

03:45.824 --> 03:50.327
Donatello, be glad that
Michelangelo's tomfoolery

03:50.329 --> 03:52.262
yielded the gift
that it did.

03:52.264 --> 03:53.430
Focus on the goal at hand.

03:53.432 --> 03:57.000
You must find all of the
transformed people of New York

03:57.002 --> 03:57.901
and change them back.

03:57.903 --> 04:00.804
But, Sensei, we don't even know
what happened to them.

04:00.806 --> 04:02.005
(April)
I think I know.

04:02.007 --> 04:05.108
They were taken to Dimension X
by the Kraang.

04:05.110 --> 04:06.910
I can see them in my dreams,

04:06.912 --> 04:11.848
millions of mutated humans
trapped there.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.350
So we drop in to TCRI,

04:13.352 --> 04:16.853
break into their portal and zap
ourselves to Dimension X.

04:16.855 --> 04:19.856
Yo, we can do this!
We can save New York!

04:19.858 --> 04:24.160
And I've got the perfect new
invention to storm Dimension X!

04:24.162 --> 04:28.465
(Leonardo) A water tower.
That's your new invention?

04:28.467 --> 04:29.933
[laughter]

04:29.935 --> 04:30.367
Oh, man!

04:30.369 --> 04:34.404
Wow, that's one giant step
for turtlekind, Donnie. Nice.

04:34.406 --> 04:37.073
It's not exactly
what it appears to be.

04:37.075 --> 04:39.075
Get down!

04:39.077 --> 04:42.812
[spaceship whirring]

04:44.849 --> 04:48.518
(Leonardo)
They're scanning for humans.

04:53.424 --> 04:57.427
[quivering]

04:58.963 --> 04:59.996
[woman whimpers]

04:59.998 --> 05:01.264
[electronic beeps]

05:01.266 --> 05:05.869
Resistance to Kraang is that
which is known as futile.

05:05.871 --> 05:06.836
[both groan]

05:06.838 --> 05:09.339
Prepare to be mutated
by Kraang!

05:09.341 --> 05:13.376
- Please! No!
- Don't do it! No!

05:21.852 --> 05:24.220
[grunts, groans]

05:24.222 --> 05:26.089
Phew!
Are you two all right?

05:26.091 --> 05:29.926
- Aah! Alien turtles!
- Run!

05:29.928 --> 05:30.827
No, that's okay!

05:30.829 --> 05:35.965
It's not like we saved
your lives or anything!

05:35.967 --> 05:37.233
Booyakasha!

05:37.235 --> 05:39.602
[metal clanging]

05:39.604 --> 05:41.438
[groans]

05:41.440 --> 05:45.108
Aah!
Let's kick some Kraang!

05:50.514 --> 05:53.216
Yah!
Coming at you, Raph!

05:53.218 --> 05:54.584
Huh!

05:54.586 --> 05:56.486
[electronic beeps]

05:57.555 --> 05:58.988
- Whoa!
- Aah!

05:58.990 --> 06:01.624
Stupid probe!
Hiya!

06:01.626 --> 06:03.126
[electronic beeps]

06:03.128 --> 06:05.361
Hah!

06:05.363 --> 06:07.931
[laser guns firing]

06:07.933 --> 06:10.333
Back up off me, yo!

06:11.235 --> 06:15.572
[grunts]
That all you got?!

06:15.574 --> 06:17.907
Apparently not!

06:17.909 --> 06:20.543
Yah!

06:20.545 --> 06:23.580
(Michelangelo)
This isn't good, Bros.

06:23.582 --> 06:27.350
[gun cocks, lasers whir]

06:28.953 --> 06:32.322
(Pigeon Pete)
Oh, bread!

06:32.324 --> 06:36.426
[pecking]

06:36.428 --> 06:38.528
Oh, hiya fellas!

06:43.968 --> 06:44.634
[roars]

06:44.636 --> 06:48.071
(Michelangelo)
Leatherhead!

06:54.011 --> 06:55.078
Aah!

06:55.080 --> 06:56.112
Oh, oh!

06:56.114 --> 06:58.381
(Donatello)
Doctor Rockwell?

06:58.383 --> 07:00.183
[laughs]

07:00.185 --> 07:02.218
Pigeon Pete?!

07:02.220 --> 07:04.621
Aah!

07:12.563 --> 07:14.063
You!

07:14.065 --> 07:19.035
Greetings, Turtles!
Long time no see.

07:19.037 --> 07:22.005
[roars]

07:24.275 --> 07:27.577
(Slash)
Raphael,
good to see you, brother,

07:27.579 --> 07:29.612
and the rest of you.

07:29.614 --> 07:32.048
Turtles, meet my team,

07:32.050 --> 07:35.184
dedicated to fighting
the Kraang.

07:35.186 --> 07:37.287
The Mighty Mutanimals!

07:37.289 --> 07:41.357
Ya already know
my second in command.

07:41.359 --> 07:43.259
(Michelangelo)
Leatherhead!

07:43.261 --> 07:49.265
Heh heh, it's good to see you,
too, Michelangelo.

07:49.267 --> 07:52.502
All of you.

07:52.504 --> 07:56.739
And what, dear boy,
are you staring at?

07:56.741 --> 07:58.408
Doctor Rockwell?

07:58.410 --> 07:59.208
Indeed!

07:59.210 --> 08:01.544
The Kraang experimented
on my mind,

08:01.546 --> 08:02.579
giving me psychic powers

08:02.581 --> 08:06.516
and accidentally returning my
vast intellect in the process!

08:06.518 --> 08:08.318
[blows raspberry]

08:08.320 --> 08:10.453
Rockwell's the brains
of the team.

08:10.455 --> 08:14.724
And this is the final member
of the Mutanimals.

08:14.726 --> 08:19.495
(Raphael)
Pigeon Pete?
The world's most useless mutant?

08:19.497 --> 08:20.763
Hey!

08:20.765 --> 08:21.497
Wah! Ooh!

08:21.499 --> 08:25.335
I've toughened up a lot
since the last time you saw me!

08:25.337 --> 08:29.806
I was just a pigeon-boy,
now I'm a pigeon-man.

08:29.808 --> 08:31.641
I'm the team spy!

08:31.643 --> 08:33.775
More like decoy.

08:33.778 --> 08:36.613
Ooh, bread!

08:36.880 --> 08:40.582
Some leader, Slash.
Using your teammate as bait!

08:40.585 --> 08:43.251
You got a problem with that,
Leonardo?

08:43.254 --> 08:45.722
You attacked us.
You tried to destroy us!

08:45.724 --> 08:48.658
I wasn't right
in the head then.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.628
It was the Mutagen!

08:52.896 --> 08:54.263
He did help us,

08:54.265 --> 08:59.135
and everyone
deserves a second chance.

08:59.837 --> 09:04.407
(Leatherhead)
We trust him with our lives.

09:04.409 --> 09:08.344
Come, Turtles.
Meet our benefactor.

09:08.346 --> 09:14.350
Then you will surely
change your mind, Leonardo.

09:17.688 --> 09:19.656
[sighs]
Fine.

09:19.658 --> 09:25.228
But if this is a trap,
your shell is mine, Slash.

09:26.764 --> 09:30.299
[whirring]

09:44.281 --> 09:47.717
Huh?

09:47.719 --> 09:50.219
[all gasp]

09:51.955 --> 09:54.824
Greetings,
Ninja Turtles.

09:54.826 --> 09:57.927
[gasps]

09:57.929 --> 09:58.861
(Leonardo)
Kurtzman?

09:58.863 --> 10:01.764
Good to see you boys.
Been a long time.

10:01.766 --> 10:05.868
(Raphael)
We thought you got mutated
like the rest of New York!

10:05.870 --> 10:06.736
I made it through.

10:06.738 --> 10:09.405
I tried to find you four,
but you were gone.

10:09.407 --> 10:12.208
Fortunately, I tracked down
these noble warriors

10:12.210 --> 10:14.444
to help keep up the fight
against the Kraang.

10:14.446 --> 10:17.313
I wouldn't exactly
call them all "noble."

10:17.315 --> 10:20.717
No one in the outside world
knows what's really going on.

10:20.719 --> 10:23.419
The military, the media,
they're no help.

10:23.421 --> 10:25.555
They're all controlled by
the Kraang.

10:25.557 --> 10:27.323
But now that the Turtles
are back,

10:27.325 --> 10:29.992
we can stop the invasion,
together!

10:29.994 --> 10:30.626
What?!

10:30.628 --> 10:32.328
- No way!
- I'm not teamin' up with him.

10:32.330 --> 10:37.867
That's enough! We can't afford
to waste any more time.

10:40.437 --> 10:43.506
(Kurtzman)
The Kraang have spent
the last few months

10:43.508 --> 10:45.575
building a Mutagen Missile,

10:45.577 --> 10:49.679
which they're gonna fire
at the earth itself.

10:49.681 --> 10:50.713
[gasps]

10:50.715 --> 10:52.281
[clears throat]
Just ignore that.

10:52.283 --> 10:53.950
There's enough Mutagen
in that payload--

10:53.952 --> 10:56.819
To mutate the earth
into another Dimension X.

10:56.821 --> 10:58.955
It's rude to finish other
people's sentences, Rockwell.

10:58.957 --> 11:02.725
Well then, clearly you'll have
to speak faster, Donatello!

11:02.727 --> 11:05.428
If you think I'm gonna work with
this scrawny shelled wimp--

11:05.430 --> 11:07.396
I've had way more experience
leading a team than you!

11:07.398 --> 11:08.498
We should sit
and break bread!

11:08.500 --> 11:10.433
You are the biggest waste
of Mutagen ever!

11:10.435 --> 11:11.400
Tiny brained reptile!

11:11.402 --> 11:13.736
(Michelangelo)
Can't we just give pizza
a chance?

11:13.738 --> 11:16.005
There's enough pizza
for everyone!

11:16.007 --> 11:17.273
[arguing continues]

11:17.275 --> 11:18.674
(Kurtzman)
Oh, no!

11:18.676 --> 11:19.442
They found me!

11:19.444 --> 11:21.744
I don't know how,
but they found me!

11:21.746 --> 11:25.982
[door bangs]

11:25.984 --> 11:26.582
Aah!

11:26.584 --> 11:28.651
It is the ones called
the Turtles!

11:28.653 --> 11:31.053
(Kraangdroid)
And the others
calling themselves

11:31.055 --> 11:32.755
the Mighty Mutanimals!

11:32.757 --> 11:33.790
Get 'em!

11:33.792 --> 11:36.759
[all roar]

11:36.761 --> 11:39.729
[roars]

11:39.731 --> 11:40.563
Wah!

11:40.565 --> 11:42.565
Ow.
[grunts]

11:42.567 --> 11:45.535
[roars]

11:45.537 --> 11:46.002
[grunts]

11:46.004 --> 11:50.072
Gotta love smashing
Kraangdroids!

11:51.308 --> 11:53.943
Allow me, Donatello.

11:56.313 --> 11:56.779
Ooh!

11:56.781 --> 11:58.581
I had things
under control!

11:58.583 --> 12:02.785
Oh, yes,
you and your little stick.

12:02.787 --> 12:06.889
I can't stop it!

12:07.558 --> 12:10.426
Look out, Pete!

12:10.428 --> 12:11.060
Whoa!

12:11.062 --> 12:13.496
[both growling]

12:13.498 --> 12:15.698
Darn dirty ape! Aah!

12:15.700 --> 12:19.468
Watch out! He's got a hot one
in the chamber!

12:19.470 --> 12:22.605
[Raphael screams]

12:26.376 --> 12:29.545
The Kraang intel!

12:32.749 --> 12:35.785
Aah!

12:35.787 --> 12:36.853
- No!
- No!

12:36.855 --> 12:41.824
Mr. Kurtzman! No!

12:48.632 --> 12:51.567
Ha!

12:53.070 --> 12:55.004
Mutanimals, we're leaving!

12:55.006 --> 12:58.040
Ninjas, fall back!

12:59.810 --> 13:02.511
[Pigeon Pete screams]

13:16.894 --> 13:21.030
[labored breathing]

13:21.032 --> 13:22.098
[groans]

13:22.100 --> 13:25.635
All the intel I have
on this Kraang missile...

13:25.637 --> 13:26.836
[groans]

13:26.838 --> 13:27.904
is on this drive.

13:27.906 --> 13:30.873
You and the Turtles
have to work together.

13:30.875 --> 13:33.175
I don't think
that's a good idea.

13:33.177 --> 13:34.577
We agree on that much.

13:34.579 --> 13:36.913
Whatever problem
is between you,

13:36.915 --> 13:39.916
you both have
a common purpose.

13:39.918 --> 13:43.519
We're running
out of time.

13:43.521 --> 13:47.156
(Slash)
Jack! Is he?

13:47.158 --> 13:48.658
(Splinter)
No. He is fine.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.860
I'm going to need
to cauterize the wound.

13:50.862 --> 13:53.029
We need alcohol,
bandages, meds.

13:53.031 --> 13:54.263
(Casey)
I'm on it, Red.

13:54.265 --> 13:55.865
There's a pharmacy
down the street

13:55.867 --> 13:57.099
I'll hit for supplies.

13:57.101 --> 13:58.768
The three of us
will take care of him.

13:58.770 --> 14:00.536
You must unite
and stop that missile

14:00.538 --> 14:03.539
before it is too late.

14:03.541 --> 14:04.740
(Donatello)
I've got it!

14:04.742 --> 14:06.242
We can disable the guidance
system, or better yet--

14:06.244 --> 14:10.112
Hack in and send the missile
somewhere it can't do any harm!

14:10.114 --> 14:12.248
You stupid
psychic chimp.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.250
[screeches]

14:14.252 --> 14:15.751
Okay, we ninja in
from above,

14:15.753 --> 14:17.853
and then we drop down
and disarm the missile.

14:17.855 --> 14:19.922
Forget it!
I say ground attack.

14:19.924 --> 14:21.724
They won't even know
what hit 'em.

14:21.726 --> 14:24.093
A ground attack
is way too risky!

14:24.095 --> 14:26.996
I think the only way
this mission is gonna work

14:26.998 --> 14:28.164
is if we do both.

14:28.166 --> 14:29.065
Forget it, Raphael.

14:29.067 --> 14:31.968
Leave this to
the Mighty Mutanimals!

14:31.970 --> 14:33.669
Come on, guys!
We're outta here!

14:33.671 --> 14:35.237
Leatherhead?
Wait, hold up!

14:35.239 --> 14:39.742
Just let 'em go, Mikey.
It's not worth it.

14:39.744 --> 14:43.079
We need a way to drop down
on that missile. Donnie?

14:43.081 --> 14:46.015
I've got something
that just might work.

14:46.017 --> 14:49.051
[Leonardo and Raphael groan]

14:49.053 --> 14:50.319
Not this again!

14:50.321 --> 14:53.622
Are we gonna
flood the place?

14:53.624 --> 14:56.125
Not exactly.

15:00.330 --> 15:04.633
Whoa.

15:04.635 --> 15:06.635
I give you...

15:06.637 --> 15:07.803
the Turtle Blimp!

15:07.805 --> 15:10.639
- Cool!
- Uh, what is it?

15:18.181 --> 15:20.816
[roars]

15:48.145 --> 15:52.014
You guys are as dumb
as a box of rocks!

15:52.016 --> 15:55.851
Seriously!
What's taking you so long?

15:55.853 --> 15:57.253
It's been three months!

15:57.255 --> 15:59.221
Much of Kraang's Mutagen
supply was spent

15:59.223 --> 16:02.191
in the invasion of a city
known as New York City.

16:02.193 --> 16:05.961
What is it with the "Kraang's
invasion of the city

16:05.963 --> 16:07.963
known as New York City"?!

16:07.965 --> 16:08.798
What is that?!

16:08.800 --> 16:11.200
We've been here
for thousands of years,

16:11.202 --> 16:14.870
ya can't even speak
proper English?

16:14.872 --> 16:16.739
Kraang does not
understand the query

16:16.741 --> 16:18.641
known as
Kraang Subprime's query.

16:18.643 --> 16:23.045
I should vaporize your sorry,
pink, tentacled butt

16:23.047 --> 16:27.083
for insubordi--what?

16:27.085 --> 16:27.883
[growls]

16:27.885 --> 16:30.886
Come on, fellas!
Keep moving!

16:32.856 --> 16:35.357
I am surrounded by
incompetence!

16:35.359 --> 16:40.796
Go! Move it!
Hustle! Get them!

16:49.339 --> 16:50.439
Guys, check it out.

16:50.441 --> 16:53.442
The Mutanimals' ground attack is
the perfect distraction.

16:53.444 --> 16:57.179
While the Kraang are focusing
on them, we'll stop the missile!

16:57.181 --> 17:00.883
See, Leo. Maybe we're meant
to work together.

17:00.885 --> 17:04.752
Huh? Huh? Yeah?

17:04.755 --> 17:08.723
Feel the power of my mind!

17:08.726 --> 17:12.060
[roars, grunts]

17:17.166 --> 17:19.167
Oh, no ya don't!

17:19.170 --> 17:21.837
Aah!

17:21.839 --> 17:24.306
[laughs]

17:44.995 --> 17:46.495
Now, according to
Kurtzman's data,

17:46.497 --> 17:49.932
the missile guidance system
uses a form of binary code.

17:49.934 --> 17:53.502
Um, guys. What's worse
than regular Kraang?

17:53.504 --> 17:55.371
(Leonardo)
Flying Kraang?!

17:55.373 --> 17:58.274
Everyone cover Donnie!

17:58.276 --> 17:59.742
[growling]

17:59.744 --> 18:03.078
Aah!

18:07.017 --> 18:08.784
My head!

18:08.786 --> 18:10.386
You jerk!

18:10.388 --> 18:15.157
Ha! Nobody messes with
Kraang Subprime!

18:15.159 --> 18:19.195
Now, to launch this sucker.

18:19.197 --> 18:21.063
Huh!

18:21.065 --> 18:22.464
[groans]

18:22.466 --> 18:24.967
[roars]

18:24.969 --> 18:26.535
Rah!

18:26.537 --> 18:28.837
[groaning]

18:28.839 --> 18:29.371
Aah!

18:29.373 --> 18:31.373
Get off of me,
you freaks!

18:31.375 --> 18:36.145
[groaning]

18:39.015 --> 18:40.249
No!

18:40.251 --> 18:41.450
[gasps]

18:41.452 --> 18:44.019
(Michelangelo)
Oh, snap! Dudes!!

18:44.021 --> 18:44.987
Hang on!

18:44.989 --> 18:48.524
For the glory of Kraang!

18:58.835 --> 19:00.803
[screams]

19:00.805 --> 19:02.838
[grunts]

19:02.840 --> 19:05.874
[electronic beeps]

19:08.311 --> 19:11.213
[grunts]

19:11.215 --> 19:12.348
Aah!

19:12.350 --> 19:14.316
[grunts]

19:14.318 --> 19:18.587
[grunts, groans]

19:18.589 --> 19:19.989
[screams]

19:19.991 --> 19:21.590
[screams]

19:21.592 --> 19:23.359
Oh!

19:23.361 --> 19:26.595
[screams]

19:26.597 --> 19:27.229
Aah!

19:27.231 --> 19:28.597
(Raphael)
Donnie! Make it quick!

19:28.599 --> 19:30.499
We're about to leave
the atmosphere!

19:30.501 --> 19:31.467
Stop pressuring me!

19:31.469 --> 19:35.070
Setting a course
for the heart of the sun!

19:36.873 --> 19:37.973
[screams]

19:37.975 --> 19:39.875
[screams]

19:42.012 --> 19:45.581
Now what do we do?!

19:45.583 --> 19:48.384
Jump!

19:48.386 --> 19:50.953
[grunts]

19:50.955 --> 19:51.553
Aah!

19:51.555 --> 19:55.257
[all screaming]

20:01.231 --> 20:04.066
Activate Turtle gliders!

20:13.376 --> 20:18.113
[all scream]

20:20.250 --> 20:22.084
(Michelangelo)
Wow. Too close.

20:22.086 --> 20:26.088
I saw my entire life
flash before my eyes.

20:26.090 --> 20:28.090
(Donatello)
What did you see?

20:28.092 --> 20:30.893
Pizza. Mostly pizza.

20:30.895 --> 20:31.994
It was awesome!

20:31.996 --> 20:33.629
The Turtles got the missile!

20:33.631 --> 20:38.100
Yeah!
This calls for a loaf!

20:40.103 --> 20:42.237
(Slash)
Pete, look out!

20:42.239 --> 20:43.539
Aah!

20:43.541 --> 20:47.643
[roars, grunts]

20:47.645 --> 20:49.178
You okay?

20:49.180 --> 20:52.114
I'm good.

20:52.116 --> 20:54.249
(Kraang Subprime)
No!

20:54.251 --> 20:56.118
Booyakasha!

20:56.120 --> 21:02.124
Kraang! Retreat for now!
Retreat!

21:04.260 --> 21:07.329
[cheering]

21:07.331 --> 21:09.231
Leatherhead!

21:09.233 --> 21:10.332
My friend.

21:10.334 --> 21:13.202
I was so scared
I'd never see you again.

21:13.204 --> 21:15.537
Nice job back there,
Pete.

21:15.539 --> 21:17.039
Aw, too slow!

21:17.041 --> 21:18.407
You know...
[clears throat]

21:18.409 --> 21:21.276
I think there's room enough
for two mutant geniuses

21:21.278 --> 21:22.644
in this city, Rockwell.

21:22.646 --> 21:23.445
I concur.

21:23.447 --> 21:25.114
Of course,
warm-blooded mammals

21:25.116 --> 21:27.082
are still considered
far more intelligent

21:27.084 --> 21:31.086
than inferior, cold-blooded,
tiny-brained reptiles.

21:31.088 --> 21:32.354
[chuckles])

21:32.356 --> 21:33.021
Burn.

21:33.023 --> 21:35.524
I gotta admit, Slash,
I'm impressed.

21:35.526 --> 21:37.493
You stepped up
and saved your teammates

21:37.495 --> 21:38.560
when they needed you
the most.

21:38.562 --> 21:40.629
Told ya I changed,
Leonardo.

21:40.631 --> 21:45.100
I'm a different
kinda turtle now.

21:45.102 --> 21:48.570
All right, fellas,
time to storm TCRI!

21:48.572 --> 21:53.742
We go to Dimension X and save
the citizens of New York.

22:04.687 --> 22:06.488
So do we even have
a real plan here

22:06.490 --> 22:08.157
or are we just winging it
for laughs?

22:08.159 --> 22:10.392
(Donatello)
It's all on
the Mighty Mutanimals.

22:10.394 --> 22:11.693
First they break into TCRI,

22:11.695 --> 22:14.163
then Doc Rockwell activates
the portal.

22:14.165 --> 22:16.532
And then it's back
to Dimension X!

22:16.534 --> 22:19.802
Yeah, boy!
I get to be smart again.

22:19.804 --> 22:21.437
I get the first part.
Makes sense.

22:21.439 --> 22:24.306
It's the "save millions
of mutated New Yorkers" part

22:24.308 --> 22:24.840
I don't get.

22:24.842 --> 22:27.643
Well, Donnie's got
his super Retro-Mutagen stuff.

22:27.645 --> 22:31.413
That'll work.
Uh, right, Donnie?

22:31.415 --> 22:32.181
Heck yeah!

22:32.183 --> 22:33.615
And once we change
all the humans back,

22:33.617 --> 22:35.684
Rockwell will hone in on us
with the Kraang portal

22:35.686 --> 22:40.856
and, theoretically,
teleport us all back to Earth.

22:40.858 --> 22:42.724
Hopefully.

22:42.726 --> 22:43.559
Maybe.

22:43.561 --> 22:44.893
Yep. We're doomed.

22:44.895 --> 22:47.429
It's an awesome plan,
Raph.

22:47.431 --> 22:49.832
Dimension X,
here we come!

22:49.834 --> 22:52.601
I just hope the Mutanimals
don't screw this up.

22:52.603 --> 22:57.239
If they can't get
that portal open...

22:57.241 --> 22:59.308
[all roar]

22:59.310 --> 23:00.609
Aw, Kraang.

23:00.611 --> 23:02.778
Mutanimals, ho!

23:02.780 --> 23:04.580
[roars]

23:10.420 --> 23:13.589
Crush Kraang!

23:17.594 --> 23:21.396
Doc, get that
portal up pronto!

23:25.935 --> 23:27.636
Hacking in now.

23:27.638 --> 23:31.707
Doc, hurry it up!

23:33.543 --> 23:37.379
Bread! Give me bread!

23:37.780 --> 23:41.550
(Doc Rockwell)
The portal is up!

23:50.460 --> 23:52.394
Yes! They did it!!

23:52.396 --> 23:53.495
Unbelievable.

23:53.497 --> 23:54.763
Hoist the mizzenmast, lads!

23:54.765 --> 23:57.933
This pirate ship's about to jack
Dimension X!

23:57.935 --> 24:01.803
Ready your oxygen converters,
guys.

24:01.805 --> 24:05.707
(Michelangelo)
Booyakasha!

24:13.616 --> 24:15.317
So those Turtle freaks think

24:15.319 --> 24:18.020
they're goin' to
my home turf?

24:18.022 --> 24:21.490
Fuggedaboutit!

24:27.964 --> 24:31.466
- Aah!
- [laughs]

24:35.672 --> 24:36.972
[screams]

24:36.974 --> 24:42.578
Okay.
Welcome back to Dimension X.

24:46.416 --> 24:48.951
Phew.
Well, that's 23% better.

24:48.953 --> 24:53.021
And I got a way of making it
a thousand times better.

24:53.023 --> 24:55.524
Booyakasha!

24:55.526 --> 24:58.026
[Leonardo coughing]
Mikey!

24:58.028 --> 24:58.660
[coughs]

24:58.662 --> 25:02.831
Savage Mikey
of Dimension X returns!

25:02.833 --> 25:04.866
Again with the costumes!

25:04.868 --> 25:06.768
Let's just
go with it.

25:06.770 --> 25:07.569
[groans]

25:07.571 --> 25:08.837
[clears throat]
Great, "Savage Mikey,"

25:08.839 --> 25:11.740
so, uh, where do you think
the Kraang are keeping

25:11.742 --> 25:13.742
all those mutated humans?

25:13.744 --> 25:15.077
Hold on.

25:15.079 --> 25:18.981
I can sense them close by
with my organic antenna.

25:18.983 --> 25:21.783
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa.

25:21.785 --> 25:24.653
Wa, wa, wa, wa,
wa, wa, wa, wa.

25:24.655 --> 25:26.755
Wah, beep, beep.
[gasps]

25:26.757 --> 25:27.823
That way!

25:27.825 --> 25:29.858
You heard the man,
Donnie.

25:29.860 --> 25:32.561
Full speed ahead!
Hiya!

25:32.563 --> 25:36.965
We gotta keep that portal open
for the sake of the city!

25:36.967 --> 25:39.768
It's impossible!
They just keep coming!

25:39.770 --> 25:43.538
And we're getting low
on sourdough!

25:49.412 --> 25:51.446
Biodroids. Irmabots.

25:51.448 --> 25:55.651
We are in a staggeringly
phenomenal amount of danger.

25:55.653 --> 25:58.520
Destroy the mutants!

25:58.522 --> 26:02.524
Mutanimals, don't let 'em
near Rockwell!

26:03.426 --> 26:06.828
Aah! Help, fellas!

26:06.830 --> 26:08.730
[grunts]

26:08.732 --> 26:11.967
[grunts, groans]

26:20.143 --> 26:22.511
[screeches]

26:22.513 --> 26:26.648
My psychic amplifier!

26:26.650 --> 26:28.417
[screams]

26:28.851 --> 26:30.786
(Leonardo)
So where are all the people?

26:30.788 --> 26:32.754
Feels like we've
been searching forever.

26:32.756 --> 26:36.525
You got any idea where we're
going, Mikey, for real?

26:36.527 --> 26:39.594
Of course I do, dude!

26:39.596 --> 26:40.796
[laughs weakly]

26:40.798 --> 26:41.396
[roars]

26:41.398 --> 26:43.832
But there are always surprises
along the way.

26:43.834 --> 26:44.766
[laughs weakly]

26:44.768 --> 26:48.570
It's a Kraathatrogon!
Man the defenses!

27:00.750 --> 27:03.819
[screams]

27:05.855 --> 27:09.591
[all scream]

27:14.797 --> 27:18.600
Uh,
I think I broke my brain.

27:18.602 --> 27:19.601
Ha, what brain?

27:19.603 --> 27:24.806
I'm takin' this freaky
space worm down myself!

27:24.808 --> 27:27.976
[screams]

27:30.046 --> 27:32.681
Whoa!

27:33.082 --> 27:34.916
I got this, D!

27:34.918 --> 27:38.019
Hoo! Hoo! Ha!

27:38.021 --> 27:41.189
[space worm rattles]

27:43.092 --> 27:45.160
Hiya!

27:45.162 --> 27:49.464
Aah!
Ooh, wah!

27:49.466 --> 27:50.499
Wah!

27:50.501 --> 27:54.836
FYI, guys, Kraang worms'
weak spot are their butt faces.

27:54.838 --> 27:56.571
Got that?

27:56.573 --> 27:57.706
Guys, look!

27:57.708 --> 28:04.012
(Leonardo)
This just keeps getting worse
and worse and worse.

28:04.014 --> 28:05.213
Let me guess.

28:05.215 --> 28:08.550
The humans that got Kraangatized
have been turned into servants

28:08.552 --> 28:11.186
and are mining energy crystals
for the Kraang.

28:11.188 --> 28:14.890
Mikey, you never cease
to amaze me.

28:14.892 --> 28:16.958
I'm sweet like that,
dude.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.795
So we figure out a way
to turn the humans back--

28:19.797 --> 28:23.064
And then the Mutanimals figure
out a way to bring us all home.

28:23.066 --> 28:24.666
It doesn't seem possible.

28:24.668 --> 28:27.002
Dude, it's
the Mighty Mutanimals,

28:27.004 --> 28:29.137
the operative word being
"mighty."

28:29.139 --> 28:31.940
They got it all
under control!

28:31.942 --> 28:35.744
(Slash)
Rockwell! Ugh!

28:35.746 --> 28:39.214
Leatherhead, take down
that robot now!

28:39.216 --> 28:42.884
[roars]

28:49.926 --> 28:53.195
[roars]

28:56.165 --> 28:58.834
Let me go, beast!

28:58.836 --> 29:01.169
[growls]

29:01.171 --> 29:04.039
[both grunting]

29:06.576 --> 29:07.242
Aah!

29:07.244 --> 29:09.644
(Slash)
No. My team.

29:09.646 --> 29:12.214
Give up, Mutant,
or your friends will perish.

29:12.216 --> 29:15.217
Slash! You can't let them
deactivate the portal!

29:15.219 --> 29:18.753
The Turtles will be trapped
in Dimension X!

29:18.755 --> 29:22.891
[growls]

29:32.668 --> 29:35.604
My friends.

29:35.606 --> 29:43.845
No!

29:43.847 --> 29:46.681
(Leonardo)
It looks like the Kraang
have human hybrids

29:46.683 --> 29:48.049
on those three islands.

29:48.051 --> 29:49.351
Those islands
are huge, man.

29:49.353 --> 29:51.920
I mean, how are we gonna turn
all those mutants

29:51.922 --> 29:52.888
back into people?

29:52.890 --> 29:54.055
(Donatello)
You forget, Raph.

29:54.057 --> 29:56.391
We just need to find
a massive amount of Mutagen

29:56.393 --> 29:59.227
and convert it into
Retro-Mutagen with this.

29:59.229 --> 30:02.931
Oh, is that all?
A massive amount of Mutagen?

30:02.933 --> 30:05.700
Let me just milk
a few thousand Kraang worms.

30:05.702 --> 30:08.803
I bet that thing has a ton
of Mutagen inside of it!

30:08.805 --> 30:11.106
(Leonardo)
A technodrome? Mikey.

30:11.108 --> 30:13.875
Don't say it. I know.
I'm a genius.

30:13.877 --> 30:17.779
I was gonna say you're crazy!
Steal a technodrome?!

30:17.781 --> 30:20.715
And how would we even get there?
The blimp's a wreck.

30:20.717 --> 30:23.752
Or we could borrow one of
those stealth ships

30:23.754 --> 30:24.986
parked over there.

30:24.988 --> 30:25.787
Just sayin'.

30:25.789 --> 30:29.457
This is so crazy,
I'm starting to like this plan.

30:29.459 --> 30:32.394
All right, guys. Stay frosty.
And keep quiet.

30:32.396 --> 30:36.097
And all those other Leo-isms
Leo likes to say.

30:36.099 --> 30:39.768
[sighs]

30:39.770 --> 30:43.905
(all) Whoa!

30:44.974 --> 30:47.042
(Leonardo) Okay team,
when I give the signal--

30:47.044 --> 30:49.844
It'll be this--
Caw caw! Caw caw!

30:49.846 --> 30:52.747
And then we sneak inside
the ship.

30:52.749 --> 30:56.251
That sounds like
a great idea!

30:56.253 --> 30:58.453
(Donatello)
Not this guy again.

30:58.455 --> 31:02.991
That's right, mutant freaks!

31:02.993 --> 31:04.960
Kraang Subprime returns!

31:04.962 --> 31:09.030
You like that, don't ya?
Do you like this?

31:09.032 --> 31:09.831
Huh!

31:09.833 --> 31:11.032
Yeah, you like that.

31:11.034 --> 31:16.237
Now come quietly
or I vaporize ya.

31:17.740 --> 31:20.075
Ha! You missed!

31:21.510 --> 31:23.478
Huh?

31:23.480 --> 31:26.247
[high-pitched scream]

31:26.249 --> 31:27.248
[Kraang subprime screams]

31:27.250 --> 31:28.516
You did it,
little brother!

31:28.518 --> 31:33.288
That's cause I'm
suh-suh-suh-sweet.

31:35.191 --> 31:36.925
Get this baby moving, D!

31:36.927 --> 31:40.095
I'm starting it.
I'm starting it!

31:41.831 --> 31:43.264
So you really know how
to fly this thing?

31:43.266 --> 31:46.101
Um, sort of.
I kinda did it before.

31:46.103 --> 31:47.035
Not exactly.

31:47.037 --> 31:51.773
(Raphael)
Just get this bird
in the air already!

31:51.775 --> 31:54.209
Forward might be nice.

31:54.211 --> 31:57.245
Let me handle this, D!

32:02.118 --> 32:04.319
[groans]

32:04.321 --> 32:06.421
[mumbling]

32:06.423 --> 32:09.991
Kraang Subprime to hive base!

32:09.993 --> 32:12.961
Turtles have hijacked
a stealth ship!

32:12.963 --> 32:16.531
What are the orders that
Kraang Subprime wishes to order

32:16.533 --> 32:17.499
as an order to--

32:17.501 --> 32:19.367
Oy, just shut up already.

32:19.369 --> 32:25.040
Do me a favor and unleash
the dracodroid!

32:33.049 --> 32:36.851
[roaring]

32:47.830 --> 32:52.267
So what are we gonna do when
we reach that technodrome, huh?

32:52.269 --> 32:54.469
Anyone thought
that far ahead?

32:54.471 --> 32:55.336
Um, not really?

32:55.338 --> 32:59.874
Uh, guys. I think we've got
bigger, badder problems.

32:59.876 --> 33:01.309
Look!

33:01.311 --> 33:02.277
(Raphael)
Mikey?

33:02.279 --> 33:06.081
I've never seen that thing
before.

33:06.083 --> 33:09.084
Brace yourselves!
Whoa!

33:09.086 --> 33:11.519
Whoo-hoo!

33:11.521 --> 33:13.855
Whoa! Whoa!

33:13.857 --> 33:16.224
Aah!

33:16.992 --> 33:21.996
Strap your shells on tight,
bros.

33:25.267 --> 33:27.202
[roars]

33:27.204 --> 33:29.604
(Michelangelo)
Booyakasha!

33:29.606 --> 33:32.040
(Raphael)
Left! Go left!

33:32.042 --> 33:35.577
(Leonardo)
No, go right! Right!

33:35.579 --> 33:37.445
(Donatello)
Look out!

33:37.447 --> 33:41.516
(all)
Aah!

33:47.022 --> 33:48.890
[Slash grunting]
Let us out!

33:48.892 --> 33:52.127
I swear, once I break
these walls down, I'll--

33:52.129 --> 33:54.462
It is useless, my friend.

33:54.464 --> 33:57.532
It's my fault
we got captured.

33:57.534 --> 34:00.268
Maybe Leonardo was right.

34:00.270 --> 34:04.372
Maybe I'm not fit
to lead this team.

34:04.374 --> 34:08.543
I have seen you save humans
from the Kraang,

34:08.545 --> 34:11.179
rescue your fellow mutants.

34:11.181 --> 34:15.449
You are a good soul,
Slash.

34:15.452 --> 34:16.650
Thank you, brother.

34:16.652 --> 34:18.286
But if we can't save
the Turtles,

34:18.288 --> 34:22.223
then all of the humans
of New York are doomed.

34:22.225 --> 34:24.525
We failed.

34:24.527 --> 34:27.027
I'm--I'm losing it, guys.

34:27.030 --> 34:28.295
The walls. Too cramped!

34:28.297 --> 34:30.264
I have to go
to the bathroom!

34:30.266 --> 34:30.931
Ugh!

34:30.934 --> 34:35.402
Calm down, man!
I'm trying to focus!

34:35.405 --> 34:39.274
Om.

34:39.275 --> 34:42.476
Om.

34:46.581 --> 34:48.449
Ha!

34:48.451 --> 34:51.351
[all yelling]

34:53.656 --> 34:56.391
We made it!
Wow, that was easy.

34:56.393 --> 34:59.260
Um, Raph.

35:07.102 --> 35:12.106
(Raphael)
Aw, Kraang.

35:12.108 --> 35:13.341
Turtles, attack!

35:13.343 --> 35:17.478
Leo, I'm leader
in Dimension X!

35:17.480 --> 35:19.747
Hoo-ah!

35:19.749 --> 35:21.549
Attack!

35:21.551 --> 35:26.254
Then figure out a way to take
out all these Kraangdroids!

35:30.192 --> 35:31.626
Hoo-ah!

35:31.628 --> 35:34.295
Hiya!

35:36.832 --> 35:39.767
Huh!

35:39.769 --> 35:41.569
Aah!

35:43.439 --> 35:47.208
Oh, yeah!
Check me out!

35:48.143 --> 35:51.613
[laughs]

35:54.483 --> 35:56.551
(Raphael)
Mikey, that was amazing!

35:56.553 --> 35:58.686
Dimension X
plus years of video games

35:58.688 --> 36:01.122
equals Mikey awesomeness!

36:01.124 --> 36:03.224
Great, just get
this thing moving!

36:03.226 --> 36:04.392
Donnie,
what have we got?

36:04.394 --> 36:05.693
Good news.
It looks like we have access

36:05.695 --> 36:08.096
to their mutagen supply
through this fuel tube.

36:08.098 --> 36:09.831
Not only do they use Mutagen
to terraform,

36:09.833 --> 36:14.269
they use it to power the ship.
We've got a massive supply!

36:14.271 --> 36:15.803
Like--like this much!

36:15.805 --> 36:20.541
[computer beeping]

36:27.416 --> 36:29.817
(Michelangelo)
Yes! She's moving!

36:29.819 --> 36:31.619
Let's save New York!

36:31.621 --> 36:34.722
What's Rockwell doing,
Leatherhead?

36:34.724 --> 36:35.857
Focusing.

36:35.859 --> 36:38.459
Without
his psychic amplifier,

36:38.461 --> 36:42.196
his power is
greatly diminished.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.833
(Pigeon Pete)
It's working!

36:45.835 --> 36:50.438
It's working!
Joy, joy!

36:52.341 --> 36:54.208
You did good, Doc!

36:54.210 --> 36:55.510
Freedom!

36:55.512 --> 36:58.880
[all growling and roaring]

36:58.882 --> 37:03.651
(Doc Rockwell) We still have to
reactivate that portal!

37:10.492 --> 37:13.895
(Leonardo)
We have a visual on
the human hybrids, Donatello.

37:13.897 --> 37:15.229
We need that portal
ready to go.

37:15.231 --> 37:19.734
Give me two seconds. I've
got to add the Retro-Mutagen.

37:25.374 --> 37:26.174
[grinding]

37:26.176 --> 37:27.375
(Leonardo)
Something's wrong.

37:27.377 --> 37:29.177
What's going on, Donnie?!
Report!

37:29.179 --> 37:32.280
I told you,
the technodrome runs on Mutagen.

37:32.282 --> 37:36.751
Aah! The engines just can't take
Retro-Mutagen, Captain!

37:36.753 --> 37:37.852
(Michelangelo)
Not necessarily.

37:37.854 --> 37:40.355
I just need to alter
the ship's fuel convertors,

37:40.357 --> 37:45.593
tweak the quantum
defiblitrons, and...

37:45.595 --> 37:49.731
voilà!

37:52.768 --> 37:53.868
Mikey, you're--

37:53.870 --> 37:54.936
A genius, I know.

37:54.938 --> 37:56.804
Wasting time!
Get this thing moving!

37:56.806 --> 38:00.975
We have to save
the humans already!

38:02.778 --> 38:04.779
Here's Kraangy!

38:04.781 --> 38:07.348
Okay, Donnie,
we need that portal open!

38:07.350 --> 38:08.816
Call up
the Mutanimals!

38:08.818 --> 38:11.886
Come in, Doctor Rockwell.
Doc? You there?

38:11.888 --> 38:13.321
Anybody?!

38:13.323 --> 38:16.257
Great. If the Mutanimals
can't transport us back,

38:16.259 --> 38:18.626
cancel the entire
rescue mission.

38:18.628 --> 38:21.429
And us going home.

38:22.498 --> 38:26.701
Just do it already!

38:26.703 --> 38:29.370
Now, if we can transform
the portal

38:29.372 --> 38:32.407
into a three-dimensional
coordinate locked beam--

38:32.409 --> 38:35.743
[metal clangs]

38:36.879 --> 38:38.746
[roars]

38:42.251 --> 38:44.986
Yes! The portal is a go!

38:47.689 --> 38:49.424
We did it!

38:49.426 --> 38:52.026
Donatello,
we are back online.

38:52.028 --> 38:55.263
30 seconds until we teleport
you home.

38:55.265 --> 38:56.330
Sending coordinates now,

38:56.332 --> 38:59.567
adjusting for
fifth dimensional space.

38:59.569 --> 39:02.637
(Michelangelo)
There they are! The hybrids.

39:02.639 --> 39:03.905
Aw, man, look at them!

39:03.907 --> 39:07.008
They're forced to work
like Kravarian ant-people.

39:07.010 --> 39:07.942
Well, not much longer.

39:07.944 --> 39:09.844
You ready with that
Retro-Mutagen, Raph?

39:09.846 --> 39:11.846
(Raphael)
Locked and loaded!

39:11.848 --> 39:15.383
(both)
Fire!

39:19.621 --> 39:21.889
[all gasping]

39:21.891 --> 39:23.858
Sweet skills, Raph.

39:23.860 --> 39:25.393
We're not
outta this mess yet.

39:25.395 --> 39:28.529
I'm just getting started,
Turtles!

39:28.531 --> 39:31.999
I'm coming for
your sweet shells!

39:32.001 --> 39:35.703
Donnie, we need those humans
teleported out now!

39:35.705 --> 39:38.339
I'm on it!

39:40.075 --> 39:43.744
We did it. We turned a
multidimensional transmat device

39:43.746 --> 39:45.546
into a mass-displacement
teleporter!

39:45.548 --> 39:48.850
I have no idea what you just
said, but hooray?

39:48.852 --> 39:51.652
That's how
we're going home, Raph.

39:51.654 --> 39:54.055
Teleportation, y'all.

39:54.057 --> 39:55.056
Just like space heroes!

39:55.058 --> 39:59.827
No way! Forget it.
You're not beaming my particles!

40:00.729 --> 40:02.797
Surprise!

40:02.799 --> 40:06.434
Forget about me, Turtles?

40:06.436 --> 40:09.003
Okay, let's start beaming
particles, Donnie!

40:09.005 --> 40:10.471
[grunting]

40:10.473 --> 40:14.475
Eliminate the ones
called the Turtles.

40:15.477 --> 40:17.912
[grunting]

40:17.914 --> 40:22.783
You've gotta hold 'em off, Leo!
I've gotta pilot this thing!

40:22.785 --> 40:24.986
Hold 'em off? How?!

40:24.988 --> 40:30.591
Yeah, that's a real good
question, Greenie.

40:30.593 --> 40:32.827
[all scream]

40:32.829 --> 40:35.062
[grunts]

40:36.798 --> 40:40.101
Ha! Hiya!

40:40.103 --> 40:41.969
[laughs]

40:41.971 --> 40:45.106
[grunts]

40:48.043 --> 40:48.676
Ya!

40:48.678 --> 40:53.481
There's one last island, Raph.
Do we have enough Retro-Mutagen?

40:53.483 --> 40:57.418
Down to 10%.

40:57.420 --> 41:00.154
[all gasp]

41:00.156 --> 41:02.423
That's it,
that's all the humans.

41:02.425 --> 41:04.825
Sending the last set
of coordinates--ours!

41:04.827 --> 41:06.861
Get us outta here,
Rockwell!

41:06.863 --> 41:09.063
Confirmed.

41:09.065 --> 41:10.798
(Raphael)
Leo!

41:10.800 --> 41:13.834
You're finished,
Turtle scum.

41:13.836 --> 41:15.403
Finished!

41:15.405 --> 41:18.739
[laughs]

41:18.741 --> 41:21.108
No! It can't be!

41:21.110 --> 41:22.510
No!

41:22.512 --> 41:25.813
I was so close this time!

41:25.815 --> 41:29.684
So close!

41:31.954 --> 41:35.056
Aw, Kraang.

41:40.095 --> 41:44.098
[electricity crackling]

42:05.821 --> 42:08.723
[all grunt]

42:10.492 --> 42:14.795
[cheers and applause]

42:15.497 --> 42:18.099
We did it.
Somehow we did it!

42:18.101 --> 42:19.567
We're the best!

42:19.569 --> 42:23.104
Go, Ninja!
Go, Ninja, go!

42:29.878 --> 42:33.648
Dad? Dad!

42:37.986 --> 42:42.023
(Donatello) Finally everything
is gonna go back to normal.

42:42.025 --> 42:45.026
Well, as normal as
this city can get.

42:45.028 --> 42:48.129
Yeah, but what about
the Mighty Mutanimals?

42:48.131 --> 42:51.132
What about us?

42:51.134 --> 42:54.769
Leatherhead!
My big green buddy!

42:54.771 --> 42:57.605
We made it,
my friend.

42:57.607 --> 42:58.773
Looks like our plan worked,
Doctor.

42:58.775 --> 43:02.176
Yes, and teleporting the Kraang
back to Dimension X

43:02.178 --> 43:04.245
was a stroke of genius.

43:04.247 --> 43:05.146
You gotta admit, Leo.

43:05.148 --> 43:07.782
We couldn't have done this
without Slash and his team.

43:07.784 --> 43:11.619
You did great, Slash.
I'm sorry I doubted you.

43:11.621 --> 43:14.822
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

43:14.824 --> 43:16.991
I just tried
to model myself

43:16.993 --> 43:20.628
after the best leader
I ever knew.

43:20.630 --> 43:21.595
You.

43:21.597 --> 43:24.532
Turtles.
Mutanimals.

43:24.534 --> 43:26.133
It's time to celebrate!

43:26.135 --> 43:33.974
(all)
Booyakasha!
