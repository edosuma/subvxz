[music playing]

00:03.737 --> 00:07.041
[theme music]

00:13.414 --> 00:15.816
No beer?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.485
Oh, I think Mark
took the last one.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.125
I'll get you more beer, Dan.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.160
After all, it is
Thanksgiving, the day

00:26.194 --> 00:27.795
where I do everything
and the rest of you

00:27.828 --> 00:30.431
sit around like Plymouth Rock.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.533
DAN: Fine, don't get the beer.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.835
No, I feel I should, Dan.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.172
I mean, you do too much, what
with having to carve the turkey

00:38.206 --> 00:42.009
tomorrow from 5:00 to 5:10.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.179
Mom, why don't you let me
do the cooking this year?

00:45.213 --> 00:46.514
I mean, ever since
we've moved in here,

00:46.547 --> 00:48.449
I've just felt like a burden,
especially seeing how much

00:48.482 --> 00:49.983
Dad hates having Mark around.

00:50.017 --> 00:52.353
Oh, Becky, you're no burden.

00:52.386 --> 00:55.789
What about Dad hating Mark?

00:55.823 --> 00:58.992
What makes you feel
like you're a burden?

00:59.026 --> 00:59.893
Come on, Mom.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.295
You do everything for us.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.730
Please?

01:02.763 --> 01:03.631
OK.

01:03.664 --> 01:04.865
I'll let you do it.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.568
I'll let you do all the
cooking, all the cleaning up.

01:07.601 --> 01:08.469
And all the laundry.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.238
The laundry?

01:10.271 --> 01:11.439
I took a shot.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.907
[phone ringing]

01:13.941 --> 01:15.976
Hey, by the way,
you're out of beer.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.612
[phone ringing]

01:18.646 --> 01:20.514
Hello?

01:20.548 --> 01:22.150
Oh, hi, Darlene.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.152
What time is your bus coming in?

01:24.185 --> 01:26.754
Actually, Mom I was wondering
if instead of coming home

01:26.787 --> 01:29.357
it'd be OK if I went to
Michigan to see David.

01:29.390 --> 01:33.127
You know, I don't really
get to see him that often.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.162
Fine, go ahead.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.062
Go.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.997
DARLENE (ON PHONE): Thanks.

01:37.030 --> 01:40.401
[sigh] Don't feel guilty about
missing your great grandma.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.637
I'm sure she can hang
on 'til Christmas.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.507
OK, bye.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.841
Wow, she bought it?

01:47.875 --> 01:48.842
Yeah.

01:48.876 --> 01:52.045
We should join together
and give thanks.

JACKIE: Hello!

02:44.565 --> 02:45.733
BECKY: Hey, Jacks.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.368
Did you bring the cranberry
sauce like I asked?

02:47.401 --> 02:48.269
Oh, isn't that cute.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.204
Just like a little Roseanne.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.405
What time did you to get up?

02:51.439 --> 02:53.607
Look at the circles
under your eyes!

02:53.641 --> 02:57.044
It's not cute anymore.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.011
Need some help with that?

02:58.045 --> 02:58.912
No, no, no.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.414
I got it.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.815
No, I'm good.

03:01.849 --> 03:07.555
I see you got the, uh,
canned yams and the carrots.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.822
By the way, I invited Fred.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.923
And the potato--

03:09.957 --> 03:11.725
Roseanne!

03:11.759 --> 03:14.528
Well, Dan said he doesn't
have any family here,

03:14.562 --> 03:16.497
and, you know,
it's Thanksgiving,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.666
and nobody should be
alone on Thanksgiving.

03:18.699 --> 03:19.500
Except maybe Mom.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.036
Alone?

03:23.070 --> 03:24.638
Really?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.674
But still, ever since
he got me pregnant

03:26.707 --> 03:28.942
Mom's been pushing me to go out
with him, and if she sees him

03:28.976 --> 03:31.211
here she's just going to
think I listened to her.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.480
If she thinks I
listened to her, she's

03:32.513 --> 03:33.847
going to keep talking to me.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.383
Well, don't worry about it.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.285
We'll just tell her
that Fred wanted

03:37.318 --> 03:38.519
turkey when he slept with you.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.624
I just caught the biggest
rat you've ever seen

03:43.657 --> 03:45.693
in that trap out in the garage.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.095
Unless-- what color
is the Martins' dog?

03:52.032 --> 03:53.233
Need some help
taking care of that?

03:53.267 --> 03:54.134
No, I'll get it later.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.068
You sure?

03:55.102 --> 03:56.837
Yeah, I'm sure.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.739
Suit yourself

03:58.772 --> 04:00.441
Thanks a lot, Dad.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.410
Mark, wait!

04:02.443 --> 04:04.177
Jeez.

04:04.211 --> 04:07.180
Can't you even make an effort
to try to be nice to him.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.181
I don't know, Roseanne.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.617
I just find it a
little awkward sharing

04:09.650 --> 04:12.620
a house with a guy who eloped
with my 17-year-old daughter.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.756
And now he's run
off with my beer.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.724
Hello.
DAN: Hey, Fred.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.326
- Hi!
- Hey, Jackie.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.727
Glad you could make it, Fred.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.363
Yeah, well, with 16 cousins my
family could use the extra room

04:22.396 --> 04:24.465
at the kid's table.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.133
16 cousins.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.636
I didn't know Fred
had 16 cousins.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.905
We're a fertile
people, Jackie.

04:31.939 --> 04:35.376
You know, Fred, us speaking
here is making it very hard

04:35.409 --> 04:37.177
for them to talk about
us behind our back.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.579
To the living room!

04:38.612 --> 04:41.014
For football!

04:41.048 --> 04:42.783
No family for
Thanksgiving, huh?

04:42.816 --> 04:44.952
Stop trying to
shove us together.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.720
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I think the two of you

04:46.754 --> 04:50.090
have already been
shoved together.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.993
[doorbell ringing]

04:54.094 --> 04:57.998
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!

04:58.031 --> 05:00.401
You know, I had a lot
more chips in there

05:00.434 --> 05:04.738
but Shirley ate them
all on the way down.

05:04.772 --> 05:05.573
Hello, Jackie!

05:09.109 --> 05:11.144
Is it true you're going
to let little Betty cook

05:11.178 --> 05:14.815
the whole dinner
this Thanksgiving?

05:14.848 --> 05:17.585
Mother, hang your coat
up there, right over there.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.486
All right.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.620
Roseanne, it's awful.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.455
This started last month
and it's gotten worse.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.924
She keeps confusing me
with your Aunt Shirley.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.593
She forgets everything.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.829
I'm afraid your Nana
Mary's mind is going.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.031
Oh, I know this little guy!

05:31.064 --> 05:34.034
You're, um, uh, uh, uh--

05:34.067 --> 05:34.968
DJ!

05:35.002 --> 05:35.869
DJ!

05:35.903 --> 05:38.606
That's right, of course, DJ.

05:38.639 --> 05:39.940
All right, honey.

05:39.973 --> 05:43.811
You better run home now, we're
going to have our dinner.

05:43.844 --> 05:44.745
Hi, Nana Mary!

05:44.778 --> 05:46.747
Hello, little Betty!

05:46.780 --> 05:47.715
Oh, it's nice--

05:47.748 --> 05:48.782
Uh--

05:48.816 --> 05:50.350
It's nice to see
her again, she's cute.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.785
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.888
Listen, her name is
Becky, not Betty.

05:54.922 --> 05:55.856
Yeah!

05:55.889 --> 05:58.191
And I'm not
Jackie, I'm Roseanne.

05:58.225 --> 05:59.192
Roseanne.
- Roseanne?

05:59.226 --> 06:00.193
Yes.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.663
Jackie is the one
that tried to iron

06:02.696 --> 06:05.666
your neck when she was four.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.035
Oh, my aching butt.

06:08.068 --> 06:11.238
That wasn't Jackie,
that was you, Roseanne.

06:11.271 --> 06:14.241
Well, what's going on?

06:14.274 --> 06:16.677
Listen, I'm not senile.

06:16.710 --> 06:20.347
I'm just having a little
fun with your mother.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.751
Wow, that is so cool.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.185
Fred!

06:25.218 --> 06:26.620
This is my Nana Mary.

06:26.654 --> 06:27.521
Nice to meet you.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.389
Nice to meet you, Fred.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.525
You're the guy finally
knocked up Jackie, huh?

06:34.294 --> 06:36.964
I hear that you busted
right through the condom.

06:43.704 --> 06:49.443
I don't think I should
sit too close to him, huh?

06:49.477 --> 06:50.844
Is this too close?

06:58.318 --> 07:00.754
I see Fred is here.

07:00.788 --> 07:04.592
How with it for our Jackie to
invite the father of her child

07:04.625 --> 07:05.693
to Thanksgiving.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.594
No,

07:06.627 --> 07:07.595
She didn't invite him.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.696
I did.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.364
Well, what is wrong
with the girl, Roseanne?

07:11.398 --> 07:13.967
I keep telling her that
child needs a father!

07:14.001 --> 07:15.268
Well, that's
exactly what's wrong.

07:15.302 --> 07:18.205
You keep telling her that,
she's never going to do it.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.172
So, what should I do then?

07:19.206 --> 07:20.273
Just say nothing?

07:20.307 --> 07:23.544
No, I mean, I would
enjoy that, but--

07:23.577 --> 07:26.480
see, if you really want Jackie
to get together with him,

07:26.514 --> 07:29.517
then you should tell
her that you hate him.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.851
That's ridiculous!

07:30.884 --> 07:32.319
No it isn't.

07:32.352 --> 07:33.854
Our whole lives
we've done everything

07:33.887 --> 07:36.256
just to disappoint you.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.226
Why do you think
I live like this?

07:39.259 --> 07:40.561
Fine, Roseanne.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.996
If I have to lie in order to
give advice to my daughter,

07:43.030 --> 07:45.065
then so be it.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.868
By the way, your cheekbone
makeup is lovely!

07:47.901 --> 07:50.370
The more you use,
the more I like it.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.378
Mark, it's Thanksgiving
and you're a guy.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.914
Your job is to be out
there watching football.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.516
I don't know
anything about it,

08:02.550 --> 08:03.851
I haven't cared about
football since I

08:03.884 --> 08:05.318
was about eight years old.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.954
Well, just say
what do you know.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.022
Dad'll appreciate the effort.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.291
Or you could stay
in here with us girls

08:11.324 --> 08:15.729
and talk about
Jackie's hemorrhoids.

08:15.763 --> 08:18.465
Standing's getting to be worse
than sitting, I don't know!

08:29.109 --> 08:31.511
So it's, uh, too bad about
old Brian Piccolo, huh?

08:38.418 --> 08:43.223
[music playing]

08:43.256 --> 08:44.391
Hello, Jackie.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.493
Hi, Mom.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.228
You and Nana Mary
have a nice drive?

08:48.261 --> 08:49.597
Yes!

08:49.630 --> 08:52.299
Now she's in there
entertaining Fred.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.735
Hmph!

08:54.768 --> 08:56.003
What's that supposed to mean?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.638
Oh, you want me in
there entertaining Fred.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.740
I told you before, Mom,
he's not my boyfriend.

08:59.773 --> 09:00.641
No?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.843
Well thank heaven.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.979
Him being here for Thanksgiving
and all, I was afraid he was.

09:06.013 --> 09:06.814
Phew!

09:12.319 --> 09:13.654
You don't want him
to be my boyfriend?

09:13.687 --> 09:14.755
Him?

09:14.788 --> 09:15.589
Ish!

09:20.093 --> 09:21.494
Why not?

09:21.528 --> 09:23.731
Because he's not good.

09:23.764 --> 09:24.632
He's bad.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.499
He's bad, that's why.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.467
Just thought I'd let you know!

09:31.805 --> 09:33.907
So, Fred.

09:33.941 --> 09:37.044
We have a little
time before dinner.

09:37.077 --> 09:41.514
Do you ever wonder what sex is
going to be like with Jackie,

09:41.548 --> 09:42.616
say in 50 years?

09:49.623 --> 09:54.227
Fred, even though you have
a full beer in your hand,

09:54.261 --> 09:56.730
my guess is that you'd like
to go to the kitchen right now

09:56.764 --> 09:57.631
and get another one.

09:57.665 --> 10:00.868
You read my mind.

10:00.901 --> 10:01.935
All right.

10:01.969 --> 10:02.836
Kid.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.572
Rub my feet, will you?

10:05.605 --> 10:06.473
Wait for me!

10:11.011 --> 10:14.614
Mother, what were you just
trying to pull in there?

10:14.648 --> 10:16.383
Oh, whatever are
you talking about?

10:16.416 --> 10:18.952
OK, Roseanne, you
got to hear this.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.220
For three months now
she's been trying

10:20.253 --> 10:21.421
to get me to go out with Fred.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.857
Now all of a sudden she
doesn't like him anymore.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.125
I don't think Nana
Mary's the only one

10:25.158 --> 10:26.994
around here losing her mind.

10:27.027 --> 10:30.597
Oh, Jenny, give
it to her good!

10:30.630 --> 10:33.066
By the way, when do we
start hunting for the eggs?

10:37.337 --> 10:39.106
I haven't lost my mind.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.209
Maybe I've just changed my mind.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.712
No, I know what you're doing.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.114
What, did you read about
reverse psychology in Ladies

10:47.147 --> 10:48.115
Home Journal or something?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.650
Can you believe this, Roseanne?

10:50.684 --> 10:56.389
[nervous laughter]
No, I don't believe it.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.657
I don't believe it at all!

10:57.691 --> 11:00.660
God, Mom, it's so lame!

11:00.694 --> 11:04.331
Try to Jackie a little credit.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.766
It was her!

11:05.799 --> 11:06.734
It was all her!

11:06.767 --> 11:08.101
She made me do it!

11:08.135 --> 11:09.469
That's so ridiculous!
I did not--

11:09.502 --> 11:10.637
Roseanne!

11:10.670 --> 11:11.538
--say anything like
that, it's totally untrue.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.073
You think I would do--

11:13.106 --> 11:15.142
all right, I did.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.245
I can't believe that you
would use Mom to manipulate me.

11:18.278 --> 11:22.816
Well, I applaud her efforts
to get you two together.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.484
You got pregnant, Jackie.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.686
Now you must face
the consequences

11:26.720 --> 11:28.388
and marry the father.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.724
Oh, come off it, Bev.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.861
You think everybody's got to
make the same stupid mistake

11:33.894 --> 11:36.663
you made?

11:36.696 --> 11:37.597
What?

11:37.630 --> 11:38.766
Mother.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.134
So you got yourself
knocked up with Roseanne

11:41.168 --> 11:42.335
and you had to get married.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.204
That doesn't mean
Jackie has to do it.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.344
You were pregnant with
me before you married Dad?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.846
Damn right, she was.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.315
Now, we always lied about
the day she got married.

11:55.348 --> 12:01.755
She got married June 1952, and
you were born in November 1952.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.223
Do a little math.

12:03.256 --> 12:06.626
You are not senile,
you're just mean!

12:06.659 --> 12:10.097
You promised me that you
would never tell that!

12:10.130 --> 12:12.399
No one in this whole
family cares about me!

12:12.432 --> 12:13.967
My children don't love me!

12:14.001 --> 12:15.402
You don't love me!

12:15.435 --> 12:19.572
I'm all alone, alone!

12:19.606 --> 12:20.941
I'm going after her, Dan.

12:20.974 --> 12:21.909
Release the dogs!

12:25.478 --> 12:27.247
- You OK, Jackie?
- Get out of my way, Fred.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.115
I'm not missing this!

12:31.351 --> 12:35.055
Yeah, Fred, we're
quite a family.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.325
Now that you've got
one of us pregnant,

12:38.358 --> 12:40.593
it's too late to escape.

12:40.627 --> 12:44.031
[evil laughter]

12:50.603 --> 12:53.073
[music playing]

12:53.306 --> 12:56.376
Dad, Mom and Jackie are
still chasing Grandma,

12:56.409 --> 12:58.045
so can you put the
leaves in the table?

12:58.078 --> 12:58.946
Yeah, OK.

12:58.979 --> 12:59.847
Mark'll help you.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.548
No, I can do it.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.382
Fine.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.253
Oh, that's just great, Dad.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.855
You won't even let Mark
help you with the table?

13:07.888 --> 13:08.856
Not that big a job.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.690
It's got nothing
to do with that!

13:10.723 --> 13:13.460
[sighs] Fine, I'll let
him help me with the table.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.963
I know he's looking for work.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.098
He keeps on trying
to be nice to you

13:18.131 --> 13:20.300
and you won't even be in
the same room with him!

13:20.333 --> 13:21.534
[clang] Ow!

13:21.568 --> 13:22.502
- Becky!
- Dad!

13:22.535 --> 13:23.403
What happened?

13:23.436 --> 13:24.404
I burnt my hand!

13:24.437 --> 13:25.772
All right, I'll get some ice.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.739
My hand, it hurts!

13:26.773 --> 13:27.841
Mark, I burnt my hand!

13:27.875 --> 13:28.741
Dunk it under cold water.

13:28.775 --> 13:29.742
No, no, ice is better.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.411
She's all right!
How'd it happen?

13:31.444 --> 13:32.479
It was really stupid--

13:32.512 --> 13:33.446
What's the difference
how it happened--

13:33.480 --> 13:34.581
I grabbed the
pot without a mitt!

13:34.614 --> 13:35.148
--she burned herself!
I'm putting ice on it!

13:35.182 --> 13:36.016
Don't push him!

13:36.049 --> 13:37.117
What the hell's
wrong with you?

13:37.150 --> 13:37.918
Hey, you want to help,
clean up the spill.

13:37.951 --> 13:38.852
I don't need ice, I'm fine!

13:38.886 --> 13:39.920
Hey, everybody,
let's mellow out!

13:39.953 --> 13:40.687
Look, I can handle
this, Dan you know?

13:40.720 --> 13:41.554
Yeah, you can handle it.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.956
What's that supposed to mean?

13:42.990 --> 13:44.724
It means you're living here,
you're handling things great!

13:44.757 --> 13:46.126
You told us to move
in here, you know!

13:46.159 --> 13:47.060
What's the problem now?

13:47.094 --> 13:48.661
My problem is my
daughter married

13:48.695 --> 13:50.697
a guy that can't take of her!

13:50.730 --> 13:51.965
[interposing voices]

13:51.999 --> 13:53.533
DAN: I'm begging
you, do it again!

13:53.566 --> 13:55.903
That's the first time
you've acted like a man

13:55.936 --> 13:56.904
the whole time I've known you!

13:56.937 --> 13:59.206
What in the hell is going on?

13:59.239 --> 14:00.473
Everything's fine, Rosie.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.875
Dan, bedroom!

14:03.176 --> 14:06.046
DJ: Mark hit Dad, and then
Dad hit Mark real hard.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.581
Man, Darlene, you
picked the wrong year

14:08.615 --> 14:12.419
to miss Thanksgiving.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.155
Sorry, Roseanne,
I know it was wrong.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.025
What was it like to hit him?

14:18.058 --> 14:18.926
What?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.060
Oh, was it great?

14:20.093 --> 14:22.229
Did you feel bone?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.530
Roseanne, this
isn't a good thing!

14:23.563 --> 14:24.431
It was stupid!

14:24.464 --> 14:25.432
I could have really hurt him!

14:25.465 --> 14:26.366
Yeah, I know that.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.368
Of course I know that.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.736
You're right.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.804
Man, what a Thanksgiving
this turned out to be, huh?

14:31.838 --> 14:35.475
Mom runs away, and then
you beat up our son-in-law.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.877
Did you draw blood?

14:37.911 --> 14:40.213
Oh, no.

14:40.247 --> 14:45.118
You know, now that I got out of
my system, I feel pretty good.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.586
I think I'm going to
calm down for a minute,

14:46.619 --> 14:50.323
and go out there and apologize.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.225
Hey, Dan.

14:52.259 --> 14:56.529
I'm sorry for taking the
first shot, you know?

14:56.563 --> 14:57.497
You OK?

14:57.530 --> 14:58.398
Yeah.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.466
You?

14:59.499 --> 15:00.700
Nice right.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.202
Hey, you too.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.205
That is, uh, the other side.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.039
Hey.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.815
[laughing]

15:15.848 --> 15:18.918
Wow, man are amazing.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.924
Just like, one shot, OK, you
get it all out of your system

15:24.958 --> 15:27.327
and now you're like buddies?

15:27.360 --> 15:30.597
Maybe you should hit him too!

15:30.630 --> 15:32.232
No, not after
the fight is over,

15:32.265 --> 15:34.968
it would just seem mean now.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.170
Uh, Roseanne?

15:37.204 --> 15:38.905
Your mother is out
on the porch, and she

15:38.938 --> 15:42.342
absolutely does not want you to
go out there and talk to her.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.310
She told me to tell you that.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.716
Hey, maybe it's time to
become buddies with Mom.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.523
[music playing]

16:03.396 --> 16:04.464
Mom, it's cold out here.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.066
Come on.
Come back in the house.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.134
I'm too embarrassed.

16:07.167 --> 16:10.537
I acted like such a fool.
- Yeah, I know.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.073
But this time it was
so extreme that we

16:13.106 --> 16:16.009
all felt really sorry for you.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.944
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you, Roseanne,

16:17.977 --> 16:19.612
but it was a different time.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.549
People didn't talk
about these things.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.052
OK, well, what about
the last two decades?

16:25.085 --> 16:27.520
I'm an adult, I could handle it.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.922
I'm not sure I could have
handled you knowing it.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.258
Are you kidding me?

16:31.291 --> 16:34.127
This is like the coolest thing
I've ever heard about you.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.129
Really?

16:36.163 --> 16:38.598
Then-- then you don't
think less of me?

16:38.631 --> 16:42.069
No way, Mom.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.636
I guess I should have
been honest with you

16:43.670 --> 16:45.505
girls about this years ago.

16:45.538 --> 16:49.342
If I had, maybe Jackie wouldn't
be repeating my mistakes.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.111
Oh, Mom, Jackie's
kid isn't born yet.

16:51.144 --> 16:55.082
She hasn't even begun to
repeat your real mistakes.

16:55.115 --> 16:58.118
Well, this wasn't
nearly as bad as I

16:58.151 --> 16:59.986
thought it was going to be.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.754
Mm, well, wait a
minute, Mom, I'm not

17:01.788 --> 17:03.923
done talking about this yet.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.158
All right, I guess
you have a right

17:05.192 --> 17:06.759
to ask me a few questions.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.232
If you hadn't got
pregnant with me,

17:12.265 --> 17:13.533
would you still
have married Dad?

17:17.070 --> 17:20.307
Well, no.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.809
Do you think that's why
he was mad all the time?

17:22.842 --> 17:24.177
You know, you think
that's why he treated

17:24.211 --> 17:25.845
me and Jackie like he did?

17:25.878 --> 17:27.780
Oh, Roseanne, you know
your father loved you.

17:27.814 --> 17:28.815
Do you think that's why?

17:28.848 --> 17:34.887
Well, I don't know.

17:34.921 --> 17:35.922
OK.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.357
I'm going to ask one
more question, OK?

17:37.390 --> 17:40.026
All right.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.795
Was Dad the only guy that
you were sleeping with,

17:42.829 --> 17:46.399
or is it possible that you've
been lying to me my whole life

17:46.433 --> 17:48.835
about who my real father is?

17:48.868 --> 17:52.739
Of course he was the only one!

17:52.772 --> 17:55.242
Damn.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.178
[music playing]

17:59.879 --> 18:00.680
Bye.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.886
I feel kind of bad
that we're not there.

18:06.919 --> 18:07.787
Why?

18:07.820 --> 18:09.389
They're not even your family.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.290
I know.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.392
I still feel bad.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.826
Don't you miss them?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.895
No, I'm fine here.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.963
Not at all?

18:16.996 --> 18:17.830
No, just shut up.

18:23.069 --> 18:23.936
Want some dinner?

18:23.970 --> 18:25.037
I'm carving.

18:25.071 --> 18:25.872
Sure.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.277
You want light or dark?

18:30.310 --> 18:31.578
You burnt the macaroni?

18:34.181 --> 18:35.548
No, most of it's OK.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.763
Darlene, the fact that
we're having macaroni

18:50.797 --> 18:54.401
and cheese on Thanksgiving is
like, cool and nonconformist,

18:54.434 --> 18:55.568
right?

18:55.602 --> 18:59.572
I mean, it's not pathetic
or anything, is it?

18:59.606 --> 19:01.040
Are you kidding?

19:01.073 --> 19:02.141
This is totally cool.

19:06.179 --> 19:09.081
Yeah.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.082
Cool.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.952
[music playing]

19:16.989 --> 19:18.325
Well, I'm back.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.992
Hope no one missed me.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.395
I always like to take a
little walk before dinner.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.901
If only we lived on
the rim of a volcano.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.307
You OK?

19:34.341 --> 19:35.808
Yeah.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.110
You know, it's funny, but
being unmarried and knocked up

19:38.144 --> 19:41.914
is the first thing I've
ever had in common with Mom.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.483
Well, yeah, that
and the roids.

19:48.087 --> 19:51.424
Dad, me and Mark, Jackie
and Fred, Nana Mary--

19:51.458 --> 19:55.061
Uh, don't sit
Jackie next to Fred.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.128
OK.

19:56.162 --> 19:57.697
Thanks.

19:57.730 --> 19:58.865
Yeah.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.700
After having a talk
with Mom about her life

20:00.733 --> 20:02.702
and all the mistakes
she made, I decided

20:02.735 --> 20:06.339
I'm not going to push you to
get together with Fred anymore.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.742
'Til after the holidays.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.744
So, Becky, how's the hand?

20:11.778 --> 20:14.447
Oh, it's OK.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.716
Well, why don't you go
call everybody for dinner.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.986
You go take all the glory and
I'll take over for you in here.

20:20.019 --> 20:20.987
No, Mom.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.221
I said I'd do everything
and I'll do it.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.356
Oh, don't be a martyr, Becky.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.657
You've been on
your feet all day.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.493
You deserve to sit
down with your husband

20:26.526 --> 20:28.060
and have a nice dinner.

20:28.094 --> 20:30.730
Thanks, Mom.

20:30.763 --> 20:34.166
Dinner's ready!

20:34.200 --> 20:37.003
God, I have to do
everything around here.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.906
[music playing]

20:44.477 --> 20:46.879
Well, Becky, your
first Thanksgiving

20:46.913 --> 20:49.215
is a total success.

20:49.248 --> 20:53.420
Oh, Bev, I'm sorry I
upset you so much before.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.423
I shouldn't have given away your
little secret about how you got

20:56.456 --> 20:58.291
pregnant and had to marry Al.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.893
Mother, what are
you talking about?

21:00.927 --> 21:03.763
Well, you don't have to
get so embarrassed nowadays.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.733
I mean, you threw a tantrum
and ran down the streets

21:06.766 --> 21:08.067
like a raving lunatic.

21:08.100 --> 21:13.640
Mother, that was
Thanksgiving five years ago.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.207
What the hell
you talking about?

21:15.241 --> 21:16.108
DAN: Yeah.

21:16.142 --> 21:17.677
[interposing voices]

21:19.245 --> 21:20.913
No, it wasn't.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.149
Was it?

21:23.182 --> 21:27.787
I know it's hard at your
age, but try to stay with us.
