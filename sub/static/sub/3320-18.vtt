00:02.089 --> 00:04.003
Hello? Mom!

00:06.093 --> 00:08.051
BONNIE:
Christy?

00:08.138 --> 00:10.314
Can you help me
with the groceries?

00:10.401 --> 00:11.620
Help!

00:11.707 --> 00:13.883
Yeah, I need your help!

00:13.970 --> 00:15.711
No! I need your help!

00:17.669 --> 00:20.716
'’Cause your life'’s
more important than mine.

00:20.803 --> 00:23.458
Damn it! Get your
ass up here!

00:23.545 --> 00:25.721
Well, I know what this is about.

00:29.507 --> 00:30.465
Hurry!

00:30.552 --> 00:31.901
Relax.

00:31.988 --> 00:34.121
I splurged and got
the kind the bears like.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.647
Oh, my God!
What happened?!

00:38.734 --> 00:41.432
I threw my back out really bad.

00:41.519 --> 00:42.694
How?

00:42.781 --> 00:44.218
I was taking a shower.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.829
I bent down to pick up the soap.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.048
And?

00:48.135 --> 00:49.875
That'’s it!

00:49.962 --> 00:52.835
How did you get
out of the shower?

00:52.922 --> 00:55.794
I don'’t know. Gravity.

00:55.881 --> 00:58.319
Should I call 911?

00:58.406 --> 01:00.408
No, just get me
to the bed.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.323
Okay, well, can you stand up?

01:02.410 --> 01:05.543
Do you think if I could stand
up, I might'’ve done that by now?

01:05.630 --> 01:07.545
Good point.

01:09.808 --> 01:12.115
Oh! That'’s too much Mommy naked.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.117
[clears throat]

01:14.204 --> 01:15.814
All right, well...

01:15.901 --> 01:18.687
let'’s try this.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.689
[grunting]

01:20.776 --> 01:22.473
Oh!Sorry!

01:22.560 --> 01:23.779
Ow!Sorry!

01:23.866 --> 01:25.737
Oh! Aah!Sorry!

01:25.824 --> 01:27.652
[sighing]

01:29.219 --> 01:31.047
How do you want to do
this next part?

01:31.134 --> 01:33.005
Rent a crane?

01:33.093 --> 01:35.660
Pull me to my knees.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.662
[both grunting]

01:41.797 --> 01:43.668
[panting, groaning]

01:46.323 --> 01:47.629
Okay, now what?

01:47.716 --> 01:49.718
We take a break.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.633
This is crazy!

01:51.720 --> 01:52.938
Why don'’t I call a doctor?

01:53.025 --> 01:54.636
No!Why not?

01:54.723 --> 01:56.464
I didn'’t sign up
for ObamaCare, okay?

01:56.551 --> 01:58.944
I forgot.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.121
Now lift my ass

02:01.208 --> 02:04.428
so it'’s parallel
to the bed.

02:06.561 --> 02:09.041
All right.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.478
[yells]

02:10.565 --> 02:13.307
This reminds me
of my eighth birthday.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.265
What are you talking about?

02:15.352 --> 02:17.354
You passed out
at Chuck E. Cheese,

02:17.441 --> 02:20.357
and me and the big rat had
to get you out of the ball pit.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.490
That didn'’t happen.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.927
Yeah, okay, and the rat wasn'’t
sitting at the breakfast table

02:25.014 --> 02:26.581
when I came down in the morning.

02:28.539 --> 02:29.758
You ready?

02:29.845 --> 02:31.325
Uh... yeah.

02:31.412 --> 02:32.543
On the count of three.

02:32.630 --> 02:35.459
One...[yelling]

02:35.546 --> 02:37.505
What was that?!

02:37.592 --> 02:39.507
I didn'’t want you to tense up.

02:41.900 --> 02:42.901
Are you okay?

02:42.988 --> 02:44.903
No, I'’m not okay!

02:44.990 --> 02:46.905
[panting]

02:46.992 --> 02:49.343
All right, well, do you want
to change into something

02:49.430 --> 02:50.909
more comfortable
than a shower curtain?

02:50.996 --> 02:52.476
No! I like my
shower curtain.

02:52.563 --> 02:55.784
We'’ve been through
a lot together.

02:55.871 --> 02:56.872
How about some aspirin?

02:56.959 --> 02:59.962
Yeah, with a
heroin chaser.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.878
Here we go.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.100
I'’m not a dog!

03:08.188 --> 03:09.145
Uh, okay.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.498
I'’m gonna go put
the groceries away.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.326
Is there anything else I can do?

03:16.413 --> 03:19.199
Put a pillow over my face
and finish the job.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.678
So tempting.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.639
[crying]

03:26.162 --> 03:27.642
Mom,

03:27.729 --> 03:28.860
it'’s gonna be okay.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.775
No, it'’s not.

03:30.862 --> 03:33.691
I have to pee.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.451
Oh, hi, Candace.

03:54.538 --> 03:58.063
Is Baxter around?

03:58.150 --> 04:00.718
Ah, in the pool with Roscoe.

04:00.805 --> 04:03.417
Isn'’t that nice?
[chuckles]

04:03.504 --> 04:07.159
No, I don'’t think I can come by
and take a dip.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.727
Uh, actually,
that'’s why I'’m calling.

04:09.814 --> 04:12.817
My mom threw her back out
last night, and I was wondering

04:12.904 --> 04:15.690
if you could keep Roscoe
for another day or two.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.649
Oh, thanks.

04:18.736 --> 04:21.173
That-that really helps me out.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.567
[laughs]

04:23.654 --> 04:25.439
Yeah, sure.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.397
I can see how he might
get confused

04:27.484 --> 04:30.139
as to where his real home is.

04:30.226 --> 04:32.184
Hang on a second.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.622
I hate you, you miserable cow.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.580
[yells]

04:42.978 --> 04:46.808
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.506
Still not funny.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.989
I really think we should
take you to the doctor.

04:54.076 --> 04:55.033
I'’m fine.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.948
Mom, seriously, you need to...

04:57.035 --> 04:58.254
I said I'’m fine.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.082
I just need
some coffee.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.910
Would you like me
to get it for you?
No!

05:01.997 --> 05:04.260
Gonna get it myself.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.742
Okay. [clears throat]

05:07.829 --> 05:09.657
But this is going on YouTube.

05:12.399 --> 05:15.489
Welcome to
Profiles in Courage.

05:17.621 --> 05:20.581
Injured in a tragic soap
retrieval accident,

05:20.668 --> 05:22.713
Bonnie Plunkett
is now attempting

05:22.800 --> 05:24.715
to live a normal life.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.459
Let'’s watch.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.382
Don'’t make me hurt you.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.341
Oh, please try.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.343
Please?

05:47.869 --> 05:50.959
These simple tasks
you and I take for granted

05:51.046 --> 05:55.267
require a heroic effort
from the plucky Plunkett.

06:05.147 --> 06:07.889
Do we have any straws?

06:07.976 --> 06:09.891
Top shelf.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.813
[grunting]

06:27.169 --> 06:29.040
Can I help you now?

06:32.566 --> 06:35.133
Let me hear the words.

06:35.220 --> 06:38.789
Help me!

06:39.877 --> 06:42.445
Good.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.927
Let'’s take you
to the clinic.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.016
[grunting]

06:48.103 --> 06:49.539
Uh, uh, here we go.

06:49.626 --> 06:51.062
Slowly.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.369
Slowly, slowly.

06:53.456 --> 06:54.631
Okay.

06:54.718 --> 06:55.806
[gasping]

06:55.893 --> 06:57.939
Oh! [crying]

06:58.026 --> 06:59.157
Come on, Mom.

06:59.244 --> 07:00.507
Everything'’s
gonna be fine.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.073
No, it'’s not!

07:02.160 --> 07:05.512
I have to pee again!
[crying]

07:05.599 --> 07:08.645
Well, you really shouldn'’t
drink so much coffee.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.170
[sputters]

07:12.257 --> 07:15.173
I can'’t believe we have to wait
this long to see a doctor.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.698
I think the bleeding people
go first.

07:17.785 --> 07:20.701
Fine, then stab me.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.530
Mrs. Plunkett?

07:25.532 --> 07:26.663
It'’s Ms.

07:26.750 --> 07:27.708
He means me.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.711
I'’m the Ms. he means.

07:30.798 --> 07:32.103
Hello.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.627
Hi. All right.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.150
Let'’s take a look here.

07:35.237 --> 07:38.283
Do you want me
to disrobe?

07:38.370 --> 07:39.676
That'’s okay.

07:39.763 --> 07:40.851
How about me?

07:43.332 --> 07:45.073
What were you doing
when you injured your back?

07:45.160 --> 07:48.076
[laughs]
Skiing.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.643
She fell in the shower.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.906
At the ski resort.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.257
[grunting]

07:55.344 --> 07:57.259
It'’s probably just
a severe muscle spasm.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.956
It happens
to people your age.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.483
There'’s the stab.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.223
We'’ll take a few X-rays
just to be sure.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.877
But if everything looks okay,

08:06.964 --> 08:08.488
we'’ll just send you home
with some pain pills.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.751
Ooh!
Ooh!

08:10.838 --> 08:13.101
Problem?

08:13.188 --> 08:14.842
I'’m in recovery.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.888
I have to be, uh, careful
with that stuff.

08:17.975 --> 08:18.933
So, do you not want me to...?No, no.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.369
I didn'’t say that.

08:20.456 --> 08:23.067
Because stretching exercises
could also...

08:23.154 --> 08:25.766
Hang on.
How do we do this?

08:25.853 --> 08:27.245
I'’ll call Marjorie.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.509
Oh, God! We know
what she'’s gonna say.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.423
Pills. P-I-L-L-S.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.904
People In Life Losing Sobriety.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.864
[shushes]
Hang on.

08:36.951 --> 08:38.561
Marjorie?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.215
Here, talk to Bonnie.

08:41.346 --> 08:43.131
Yeah, hey, listen. Um...

08:43.217 --> 08:44.654
I'’m at the clinic.
I hurt my back.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.569
Doctor wants to
give me pain pills.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.789
Uh-huh.

08:48.876 --> 08:49.746
Uh-huh.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.270
She wants to talk to you.

08:52.357 --> 08:54.272
Hi.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.231
No, she'’s not faking.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.061
Hang on.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.280
She wants to
talk to you.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.891
Hello?

09:03.978 --> 09:06.937
One every four hours
as needed for pain.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.112
Hold on.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.505
Back to you.

09:13.030 --> 09:15.729
Yes, he is as hot
as he sounds.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.776
Okay, unless the phone'’s
gonna do another lap,

09:19.863 --> 09:21.648
I'’ll go order the X-rays.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.258
Bye.
Bye.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.566
Thanks, Marjorie.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.437
Yeah, I understand.

09:28.524 --> 09:29.830
Got it.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.658
All right,
I'’ll talk to you later.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.050
She says it shouldn'’t
be a problem

09:33.137 --> 09:35.009
as long as you monitor
how many pills I take.

09:35.096 --> 09:37.577
It'’s my tenth birthday
all over again.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.494
Okay, it'’s 11:00.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.496
No more until 3:00 a.m.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.759
Assuming I'’m in pain.

09:45.846 --> 09:48.022
Exactly. Might
not even need it.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.850
Look at us being
responsible with drugs.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.460
Right? "Take as directed."

09:51.547 --> 09:53.418
It'’s hilarious.

09:57.074 --> 10:00.338
[deep male voice]:
Hey, baby. Miss me?

10:02.036 --> 10:02.993
Coming to bed?

10:03.080 --> 10:04.342
Coming.

10:04.429 --> 10:07.563
'’Cause I miss you.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.052
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.271
Thanks for bringing
the meeting here.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.230
The pain meds are
helping a little,

10:22.317 --> 10:24.580
but I still can'’t get
out of the house.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.365
Did they give you the 500
milligrams or the 750s?

10:27.452 --> 10:29.890
750s.

10:29.977 --> 10:32.849
[all oohing]

10:32.936 --> 10:35.678
God, why can'’t I be old
and fall in the shower?

10:37.506 --> 10:40.422
Yeah, well, anyway, uh,
pills were never my thing,

10:40.509 --> 10:43.425
so it'’s not a big deal.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.993
Are you swallowing them
or are you snorting them?

10:46.080 --> 10:48.996
I'’m taking them as directed.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.737
I don'’t understand.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.044
She'’s following
the doctor'’s orders.

10:54.131 --> 10:55.350
And I'’m proud of her.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.526
Me, too.Thank you.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.223
Anyway, that'’s...
that'’s all from me.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.877
Thanks, Bonnie.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.662
Who wants to go next?

11:02.749 --> 11:04.489
Can we at least
see them?

11:06.274 --> 11:08.319
Who wants to go next?

11:08.406 --> 11:09.930
I'’ll go.
[clears throat]

11:10.017 --> 11:12.759
Hi, I'’m Christy.
I'’m an alcoholic.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.717
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

11:14.804 --> 11:18.286
Okay, well, I'’m
glad my mom is

11:18.373 --> 11:21.115
handling the pain
pills so well,

11:21.202 --> 11:23.117
'’cause I got to tell you,

11:23.204 --> 11:26.729
just having them in the house
is a little tricky for me.

11:26.816 --> 11:30.341
When I was drinking and using,
those things were like candy.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.213
Like M&M'’s without the calories.

11:34.955 --> 11:38.741
Pills were always a way for me
to escape reality,

11:38.828 --> 11:43.833
and lately it'’s been something
I'’ve been kind of wanting to do.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.401
Between my
19-year-old daughter

11:46.488 --> 11:49.665
moving in with her
middle-aged fiancé...

11:49.752 --> 11:51.188
[whispers]:
42.

11:51.275 --> 11:51.972
[whispers]:
Ew!

11:53.756 --> 11:55.758
...and my son who'’d

11:55.845 --> 11:57.586
rather spend his weekends
with his father

11:57.673 --> 11:59.675
and his rich new girlfriend
with the boob job

11:59.762 --> 12:01.677
and the Botox
and the lips and...

12:01.764 --> 12:03.200
No offense.

12:08.858 --> 12:12.035
And on top of that,
there'’s work and school

12:12.122 --> 12:15.865
and, you know, North Korea.

12:15.952 --> 12:19.129
And it all goes away
with a couple of pills,

12:19.216 --> 12:21.653
two bottles of red wine
and a big fat joint.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.961
A big fatty.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.096
But...

12:29.183 --> 12:31.576
you know what else goes away?

12:31.663 --> 12:34.275
My family, my freedom,

12:34.362 --> 12:36.581
my friends.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.888
Pretty much everything
that'’s important to me.

12:40.672 --> 12:43.763
Anyway, I'’m just glad
you all came over.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.895
It really helps
to share.

12:45.982 --> 12:48.768
Speaking of which,
you'’re gonna love this.

12:51.901 --> 12:54.556
CHRISTY:
Welcome to Profiles in Courage.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.650
All right, I'’m going to work.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.608
Do you need anything?I'’m fine.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.915
Got my chips, got some tea,
got my remote.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.264
Do you need to go pee-pee?

13:10.311 --> 13:12.661
No.

13:12.748 --> 13:15.055
Okay, you can take
another pill in two hours

13:15.142 --> 13:16.665
or as needed for pain.

13:16.752 --> 13:17.622
You got it, boss.

13:17.709 --> 13:18.972
See you later then.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.495
And I like that.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.889
Keep calling me that.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.678
[turns TV off]

13:32.594 --> 13:34.509
"As needed."

13:36.903 --> 13:38.426
Well, let'’s see.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.183
Okay.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.228
Not there.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.939
Oh, yeah, it'’s needed!

14:18.031 --> 14:20.642
[deep male voice]:
Hi, beautiful.

14:20.729 --> 14:23.384
No.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.436
Why you playing hard to get?

14:38.486 --> 14:40.401
[sighs]

15:01.988 --> 15:03.554
Oh, who am I kidding?

15:06.209 --> 15:07.558
[high voice]:
Don'’t do it, Bonnie!

15:07.645 --> 15:09.343
Don'’t do it!

15:11.780 --> 15:13.173
[doorbell rings]

15:22.573 --> 15:24.619
Hi, have you heard
the good news?

15:24.706 --> 15:26.447
I have not. Come on in.
Tell me all about it.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.971
Um, okay.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.277
Thanks.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.322
Please, sit.

15:32.409 --> 15:33.845
I'’m Bonnie, by the way.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.586
Hi, Bonnie. I'’m Cliff.And I'’m Chip.

15:35.673 --> 15:38.285
Of course you are!

15:38.372 --> 15:40.156
So, tell me about your god.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.419
Is he a big guy on a throne
or is he just everywhere?

15:42.506 --> 15:44.552
Um, I like the
everywhere idea.

15:44.639 --> 15:45.553
Me, too. Up top.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.251
Oh!

15:48.338 --> 15:49.426
[both laugh]

15:49.513 --> 15:51.037
Okay, let'’s hear the pitch.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.429
Oh, okay, um,
so your immortal soul...Oh!

15:52.516 --> 15:53.953
Hold that thought.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.432
I'’m gonna rustle us up
some pork chops.

15:56.694 --> 15:57.739
Oh.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.349
Does your god let you eat pork?

15:59.436 --> 16:00.524
Uh, yeah.

16:00.611 --> 16:01.438
Sign me up!

16:04.485 --> 16:08.054
We are getting
really good at this!

16:08.141 --> 16:10.839
Okay, I like everything
I'’m hearing.

16:10.926 --> 16:13.102
Love the angels, golden scrolls.

16:13.189 --> 16:15.713
Forgiveness of sins--
very big issue for me.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.065
But here'’s a hypothetical.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.588
Let'’s say I do
something really bad.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.068
And I'’m not talking
masturbation.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.026
Everybody masturbates.

16:27.377 --> 16:30.990
I'’m thinking
I kill a couple of guys.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.731
What'’s your church'’s
forgiveness policy on that?

16:33.818 --> 16:35.342
Wha...?

16:35.429 --> 16:38.823
What couple of guys
you talking about?

16:38.910 --> 16:41.043
I don'’t know.
Anybody who pisses me off.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.176
[bell dings]Ooh! Apple turnovers.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.743
We'’ve got to get out of here.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.400
I left my Bible!

16:50.487 --> 16:52.359
I'’ll get you another one!

17:11.638 --> 17:12.901
Oh, hey.

17:12.988 --> 17:15.034
Hey. How are you feeling?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.776
Oh, not so good.

17:20.604 --> 17:24.391
Sleeping on this couch
didn'’t do me any favors.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.696
When was the last time
you took a pill?

17:26.784 --> 17:28.482
Ooh.
[sputters]

17:28.569 --> 17:30.440
Not since you left.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.661
Mom, don'’t be a hero.

17:35.532 --> 17:36.838
Wait here.
I'’ll go get you one.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.844
Thanks.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.381
Where'’d this come from?

18:00.862 --> 18:03.386
Do you need anything
before I get into bed?

18:03.473 --> 18:04.735
No, I'’m doing
pretty good over here.

18:04.822 --> 18:05.780
How are you doing?

18:05.867 --> 18:08.478
Well, I'’ll admit...

18:08.565 --> 18:11.655
I was kind of wrestling
with these pills being around.

18:11.742 --> 18:14.354
But sharing about it
really helped.

18:14.441 --> 18:17.270
Sure? '’Cause the minute those
things threaten your sobriety,

18:17.357 --> 18:18.923
just say the word,
I'’ll flush them.

18:19.010 --> 18:22.579
Wow. You have
changed so much.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.581
[laughs]

18:26.888 --> 18:29.630
I guess I have.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.153
All right, good night.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.112
I love you.
I love you, too.

19:00.530 --> 19:01.444
Now what?

19:01.531 --> 19:03.185
Nothing. I just got to pee.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.195
[knocking]

19:15.110 --> 19:16.198
Good news.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.113
Your X-rays look fine.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.072
Oh, great! I'’d hate to have
slipped a disk or something.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.552
[chuckles]
Help me down?

19:22.639 --> 19:23.814
Oh, sure.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.120
Thanks, Doc.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.513
Ooh.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.949
Still pretty tender, huh?

19:28.036 --> 19:31.257
Yeah. No more snowboarding
for this gal.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.650
You know, I'’m happy to prescribe
some pain medication.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.522
Gosh, uh, I don'’t know.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.698
As an athlete, I try to stay
away from that stuff.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.396
Please, let me write you
a prescription.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.964
Eh... all right.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.184
Make it for the 750s.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.205
[growls]
