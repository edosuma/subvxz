15:19.519 --> 15:22.689
YOUR SLEEPING HABITS ARE

15:22.789 --> 15:24.524
IN THE TRAILER.

15:24.624 --> 15:28.061
THAT'S REAL SWEET.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.769
AFRAID OF WHAT ?

15:36.869 --> 15:38.605
HAWKINS, PLEASE.

15:38.705 --> 15:42.542
THERE IS MUCH
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU,

15:42.642 --> 15:46.413
BUT I'VE NEVER
LIED TO YOU.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.615
NOT ONCE.

15:51.384 --> 15:55.022
I'M ONLY INTERESTED IN TRUTH
AND THE TRUTH IS,

15:55.122 --> 15:57.557
YOU'RE AN EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT MAN.

15:57.657 --> 15:58.691
NOT JUST TO ME.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.959
WHAT ?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.494
THE GIFT,

16:01.594 --> 16:04.531
IT MUST BE PRACTICED
IF YOU WISH TO ATTAIN THE SKILL

16:04.631 --> 16:09.069
NECESSARY
TO CONTROL IT.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.239
IF YOU DON'T,

16:12.339 --> 16:14.674
YOU RISK PLACING
EVERYONE YOU KNOW,

16:14.774 --> 16:17.710
EVERYONE YOU LOVE

16:17.810 --> 16:20.780
IN MORTAL DANGER.

16:20.880 --> 16:25.018
AND THAT IS WHAT
HAPPENED TO SCUDDER.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.689
YOU MUST SLEEP.

16:29.789 --> 16:33.460
YOU MUST LISTEN TO WHAT
YOUR DREAMS TELL YOU,

16:33.560 --> 16:34.627
BUT...

16:34.727 --> 16:38.498
NO MATTER
HOW TERRIBLE...

16:38.598 --> 16:42.335
THEY WILL GUIDE YOU.

16:42.435 --> 16:47.006
THEY WILL TEACH YOU TO FACE
YOUR OWN POWER AND CONTROL IT.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.409
I CAN'T.
YOU MUST !

16:49.509 --> 16:53.880
THE COST OF COWARDICE IS
FAR TOO HIGH, YOU KNOW THAT !

16:53.980 --> 16:58.685
YOUR MOTHER, SHE WAS
ONLY THE FIRST VICTIM.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.854
WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT IT ?

17:01.954 --> 17:03.256
I KNOW YOU COULD
HAVE SAVED HER,

17:03.356 --> 17:07.327
AND YET YOU LET HER DIE.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.963
HOW MANY MORE,

GO TO HELL.

17:21.908 --> 17:25.678

18:03.650 --> 18:06.219
GRADUAL-LIKE.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.358

18:15.562 --> 18:17.930
LIKE SOMETIMES WE'D CATCH HIM
STARIN' OFF INTO SPACE.

18:18.030 --> 18:23.236

REAL LONG SHOWERS.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.284
SCRUBBIN' HIMSELF BLOODY
ONE DAY SINGING

18:37.384 --> 18:39.486
"TAKE ME OUT

18:39.586 --> 18:43.556
AH, THEY TOOK

21:32.091 --> 21:33.960
NO.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.095
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

21:36.195 --> 21:39.065
WE DIDN'T PICK YOU UP
THAT DAY BY CHANCE.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.968

DARKEST BAYOU OF LOUISIANA,

21:56.849 --> 22:01.521
TURTLE BOY.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.692
I WOULDN'T GIVE TWO CENTS
FOR THAT NO-ACCOUNT.

22:39.792 --> 22:45.532
WHEN HE LEFT YOUR MAMA
HE BROKE IT.

22:45.632 --> 22:47.099
BAD.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.301
HE DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN'.

22:49.402 --> 22:52.371
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.741
IS THIS YOURS ?

22:54.841 --> 22:58.645

23:02.014 --> 23:05.418
HOW COME HE NEVER COMES

23:05.518 --> 23:07.720
WELL, I AIN'T

23:07.820 --> 23:10.356
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IT THOUGH,

23:10.457 --> 23:12.058
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

23:12.158 --> 23:15.227

FOR YOUR FRIEND, THE PROFESSOR.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.597
LODZ ?

23:17.697 --> 23:21.333

CALL HIM A FRIEND.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.903
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.806
I WOULDN'T TRUST THAT EEL

23:26.906 --> 23:28.941
BUT EVEN EELS...

23:29.041 --> 23:31.343

23:31.444 --> 23:34.581

I'M OKAY.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.061
IT'S OKAY.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.195
NO.

39:57.295 --> 39:58.196
BEN...

39:58.296 --> 40:00.632
I'M SORRY.

40:12.444 --> 40:15.313
SOFIE.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.550
ISN'T IT A LITTLE LATE
TO BE SITTIN' OUT HERE

40:18.650 --> 40:21.487
SMOKIN' A CIGARETTE ?

40:23.254 --> 40:24.456
I CAN'T GO IN THERE.

40:24.556 --> 40:27.993
WHY NOT ?

40:31.296 --> 40:34.733
SOFIE ?

40:41.072 --> 40:43.609
SHE...

40:43.709 --> 40:48.413
MY MOTHER ALWAYS TOLD ME
THAT MY FATHER LEFT HER.

40:48.514 --> 40:53.852
BUT HE DIDN'T.

40:55.621 --> 40:58.023
HE RAPED HER.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.499
SHE TOLD YOU THAT ?

41:07.599 --> 41:10.201
NO, I SAW IT.

41:13.004 --> 41:17.509
I SAW IT IN MY HEAD
LIKE I HEAR HER VOICE.

41:23.248 --> 41:25.083
SINCE WHEN ?

41:25.183 --> 41:27.919
LAST NIGHT.

41:28.019 --> 41:32.858
SHE SEES THINGS
THAT NO ONE ELSE DOES.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.460
MEANING THE PRESENT,
AND THE PAST.

41:35.561 --> 41:40.131
IT'S ALL
THE SAME TO HER.

41:43.669 --> 41:46.738
AND I'M STARTING
TO SEE IT TOO.

42:02.087 --> 42:05.190
AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW WHY
WE'VE HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE

42:05.290 --> 42:08.660
WITH YOUNG HAWKINS.

42:14.966 --> 42:20.171
( voice )
I SEE, WE SHOULD'VE
KNOWN THAT FROM BABYLON.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.625
( laughing )

42:39.725 --> 42:43.394
SO I TAKE IT
WE'RE MOVIN' ON.

42:43.494 --> 42:46.031
FIREBALL SHOWS.

42:46.131 --> 42:50.702
THEY LEAVE US
WITH NO OTHER CHOICE.

42:50.802 --> 42:53.839
WELL, THAT'S GOOD,
I'LL GET SOME SLEEP THEN.

42:56.307 --> 42:58.977
REST EASY.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.511
OH.

43:00.612 --> 43:03.915
I ALMOST FORGOT.

43:06.017 --> 43:10.055
WELL PLAYED,
LITTLE MAN.

43:11.422 --> 43:15.226
I WOULDN'T
KEEP HIM WAITING.

43:34.746 --> 43:40.118
( dogs barking )

44:02.708 --> 44:05.443
I WONDER IF
THAT POOR BABY'S

44:05.543 --> 44:07.946
EVER GONNA GET
TO THE LAND OF NOD.

44:08.046 --> 44:10.281
HE WILL.

44:10.381 --> 44:12.984
HE WILL.

44:40.545 --> 44:44.182
