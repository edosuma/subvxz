00:10.077 --> 00:12.580
I think this girl's being murdered.

00:12.581 --> 00:14.882
She's terrified.

00:14.883 --> 00:16.584
There's something here.

00:16.585 --> 00:19.519
Objects being thrown at people.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.156
She can't breathe.

00:22.157 --> 00:24.492
- Scratches up here on my arm.
- That could be a problem.

00:24.493 --> 00:27.960
Oh, my God. What's happening?

00:27.961 --> 00:32.101
Something terrible's happened to her!

00:32.633 --> 00:34.502
It's really bad in here.

00:34.503 --> 00:37.308
My name is Amy Allan.

00:37.309 --> 00:39.744
Something is not right.

00:39.745 --> 00:40.848
I see dead people.

00:40.849 --> 00:43.050
This person might have
been a serial killer.

00:43.051 --> 00:45.019
I speak to dead people.

00:45.020 --> 00:46.378
You get those chills.

00:46.379 --> 00:47.921
And they speak to me.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.297
He is darkness. He is evil.

00:50.298 --> 00:53.457
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:53.458 --> 00:54.791
I think she broke her neck.

00:54.792 --> 00:56.784
I rely on my partner.

00:56.785 --> 01:00.870
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:00.871 --> 01:02.398
Are you telling me the truth?

01:02.399 --> 01:05.501
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:05.503 --> 01:07.137
I think the Devil is down here.

01:07.138 --> 01:08.638
It's my job to reveal them.

01:08.639 --> 01:10.133
Who the hell would do this?

01:10.134 --> 01:12.039
But Steve and I never speak...

01:12.040 --> 01:14.135
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:14.136 --> 01:15.545
Until the very end.

01:15.546 --> 01:16.947
Who's he looking to kill?

01:16.948 --> 01:18.982
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:18.983 --> 01:21.123
You need to get out of here right now.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.291
Or time to get out.

01:22.292 --> 01:25.892
It was like endless darkness.

01:43.515 --> 01:46.639
Amy and I never communicate
during an investigation.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.584
I learn about the dead through
interviews and research.

01:49.585 --> 01:53.268
While Amy speaks directly to them.

01:53.269 --> 01:55.956
In the end, we meet up and reveal
our findings to each other...

01:55.957 --> 01:59.369
And our clients for the first time.

01:59.370 --> 02:04.415
I'm in Waxahachie, Texas, about
20 minutes south of Dallas.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.434
I'm heading over to meet
with a woman named Shawn,

02:06.435 --> 02:09.815
who owns a family restaurant in town.

02:09.816 --> 02:11.870
She says things have
gotten so out of control,

02:11.871 --> 02:16.459
she's worried about the safety
of her employees and her guests.

02:16.460 --> 02:20.780
She says Amy and I are her last hope.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.783
I can't hide the fact
that this is a restaurant.

02:31.784 --> 02:35.143
But I still need to be careful
to remove or cover any pictures,

02:35.144 --> 02:40.784
signs, or decorations that
could influence Amy's findings.

03:02.499 --> 03:06.207
In my opening, a Sheriff came up.

03:06.208 --> 03:09.928
And he pointed to four graves.

03:10.541 --> 03:13.576
I think he knew some of these guys.

03:13.577 --> 03:16.277
And said that...

03:16.805 --> 03:19.471
Those men had...

03:19.472 --> 03:23.492
Caused a lot of fear at the time.

03:25.105 --> 03:28.459
I'm getting a really weird smell.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.695
What a weird smell! What is this?

03:30.696 --> 03:33.576
Blood, it's blood.

03:34.753 --> 03:37.866
I'm tasting it, yeah. Yeah, it's blood.

03:37.867 --> 03:39.727
Ugh.

03:50.949 --> 03:54.185
So, Shawn, you sounded pretty concerned
on the phone about what's going on here.

03:54.186 --> 03:56.698
Yeah, we are... we are very concerned.

03:56.699 --> 03:59.647
My daughter works up
here, she's 16 years old.

03:59.648 --> 04:02.966
My mother, my husband,
and my dad are up here.

04:02.967 --> 04:06.199
And we, you know, want
to make sure everything is

04:06.200 --> 04:08.648
perfectly safe for everyone
that comes through that door.

04:08.649 --> 04:12.568
Okay. So, give me an idea what kind
of experiences you guys are having.

04:12.569 --> 04:16.459
Well, we've seen
apparitions, shadow people...

04:16.461 --> 04:20.240
Things moving around, so it
pretty much runs the gamut.

04:20.241 --> 04:23.307
- So, how long have you been here?
- I've been here for seven years.

04:23.308 --> 04:26.723
Okay. And how long has
the activity been going on?

04:26.724 --> 04:28.912
Forever, as far as I know.

04:28.913 --> 04:30.490
So, why're you calling us in now?

04:30.491 --> 04:32.729
Things have seemed to
kind of start picking up...

04:32.730 --> 04:36.289
Like objects being thrown
at people in my kitchen,

04:36.290 --> 04:40.800
and my daughter Amelia
was physically slapped.

04:40.801 --> 04:44.006
So we're worried about her.

04:44.007 --> 04:46.773
What do you hope we can do for you,
as far as the investigation goes?

04:46.774 --> 04:49.975
I would like my children to be able to

04:49.976 --> 04:53.148
pass on this legacy to
their children, and so on.

04:53.149 --> 04:55.551
This is part of who we are.

04:55.552 --> 04:58.509
Shawn, what about your customers?
Are they experiencing anything?

04:58.510 --> 05:01.518
They have told me about a lot
of the things that are happening.

05:01.519 --> 05:07.279
In fact, I have some ghost
logs that I'm gonna show you.

05:07.963 --> 05:10.225
- Whoa, geez!
- These are some firsthand accounts...

05:10.226 --> 05:15.146
That we have received
from some of our guests.

05:16.471 --> 05:18.866
We have two more like that.

05:18.867 --> 05:20.882
You're kidding?

05:20.883 --> 05:22.743
Wow!

05:23.846 --> 05:27.082
Now, what do you know about the history
of this place, I mean, it is pretty old?

05:27.083 --> 05:32.635
Well, there's a legend about a love
triangle that occurred near this location.

05:32.636 --> 05:35.017
Where a young lady was murdered.

05:35.018 --> 05:37.512
Wow, okay. Why don't you
show me around the restaurant?

05:37.513 --> 05:41.893
All right. Come on. Let's go this way.

05:54.609 --> 05:58.867
I'm seeing this little
lady, like, about this tall.

05:58.868 --> 06:01.111
And there's a male.

06:01.112 --> 06:03.932
Her son, I think.

06:04.567 --> 06:07.447
He's younger, 40s.

06:07.972 --> 06:10.542
He's not nice.

06:10.543 --> 06:13.098
It's really strange.

06:13.099 --> 06:16.459
She feels so much stress.

06:16.483 --> 06:17.946
Why?

06:17.947 --> 06:21.847
Cause she can't leave here ever.

06:29.811 --> 06:32.547
What's going on in this room
that you brought me in here?

06:32.548 --> 06:38.448
There are all sorts of descriptions
in that log book as far as apparitions.

06:38.453 --> 06:41.161
We get lots of reports on an older lady.

06:41.162 --> 06:42.636
Any description on her?

06:42.637 --> 06:44.438
That she wears glasses,
that's the only thing

06:44.439 --> 06:47.467
that people have all
consistently said... glasses.

06:47.468 --> 06:48.896
Okay.

06:48.897 --> 06:52.772
And one of the things that
I have seen in this room is

06:52.773 --> 06:57.371
some sort of shadowy figure
that appears under this table.

06:57.372 --> 06:58.792
Really?

06:58.793 --> 07:01.528
- It's like a solid figure.
- Okay.

07:01.529 --> 07:04.445
And it's shaped like a person.

07:04.446 --> 07:08.679
And we're positive it's not something
coming from the window, making it look...

07:08.680 --> 07:11.819
- Yes, I'm absolutely, 100% positive.
- Why is that?

07:11.820 --> 07:15.889
Occasionally, guests will say that
they felt something touching their leg.

07:15.890 --> 07:16.969
Wow.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.970
It's very upsetting.

07:23.464 --> 07:25.658
The older woman and the son...

07:25.659 --> 07:29.137
You know if anybody might have
experiences related to them?

07:29.138 --> 07:34.966
I think that they might both be
seen um, as, like, apparitions.

07:34.967 --> 07:36.887
Okay.

07:37.044 --> 07:39.022
Her, though...

07:39.023 --> 07:43.298
I definitely think she
would try to talk to people.

07:43.299 --> 07:45.021
Okay.

07:45.022 --> 07:49.256
And if she doesn't like something, I
think she would let people know somehow.

07:49.257 --> 07:55.017
Are there any areas in particular
that they might be more?

07:56.654 --> 07:58.814
In here.

08:14.946 --> 08:18.273
Well, this is a busy kitchen, obviously
getting ready for the dinner crowd.

08:18.274 --> 08:19.975
So why'd you bring me in here?

08:19.976 --> 08:23.087
Just today, we were actually
standing over there and,

08:23.088 --> 08:27.108
this glass just inexplainably broke.

08:27.521 --> 08:30.197
- And nothing fell on top of it?
- No.

08:30.198 --> 08:31.553
Did you hear the crack?

08:31.554 --> 08:34.067
Yes, that's why we looked over there.

08:34.068 --> 08:36.537
Wow. Anything else?

08:36.538 --> 08:39.876
I have had what appeared to
be scratches, like three...

08:39.878 --> 08:43.179
One, two, three, scratches
up here on my arm.

08:43.179 --> 08:45.489
I was cooking, and I
thought I'd burned myself.

08:45.490 --> 08:48.503
Well, that's my obvious question,
right? Did you burn yourself?

08:48.504 --> 08:51.972
No. That's like a burn mark.

08:51.973 --> 08:55.712
In my experience working with
Amy, that could be a problem.

08:55.713 --> 08:57.516
Anything else in the kitchen?

08:57.517 --> 09:01.917
I was here one day, and I'd see
something like a white apparition.

09:01.918 --> 09:05.465
And it looked just like
a person walking back...

09:05.466 --> 09:07.203
You know, like walking back and forth.

09:07.204 --> 09:09.371
How tall would you say it was?

09:09.372 --> 09:11.708
Probably about six feet tall.

09:11.709 --> 09:13.981
It had arms and such.

09:13.982 --> 09:16.402
Okay. What if Amy did tell you...

09:16.403 --> 09:19.362
It's a little bit too dangerous here
to be here, for you and your guests?

09:19.363 --> 09:22.742
That would just be sad, if it
was not something that I could...

09:22.743 --> 09:24.720
Pass on to my daughter.

09:24.721 --> 09:29.810
So I'm hoping that there's a solution
that will allow us to stay here.

09:29.811 --> 09:32.091
All right.

09:34.196 --> 09:37.316
This area's not good.

09:37.590 --> 09:40.669
I'm seeing a weird shadow.

09:40.670 --> 09:43.130
Of a female.

09:46.789 --> 09:50.329
Her arms are long and thin.

09:52.702 --> 09:55.762
She's stretching out.

09:56.121 --> 09:57.921
Mm!

10:00.780 --> 10:03.592
- Are you okay?
- No!

10:03.593 --> 10:07.125
She can't feel her arms or legs.

10:07.126 --> 10:08.918
And she can't breathe.

10:08.919 --> 10:11.799
No... like [Bleep]!

10:12.944 --> 10:14.951
Why are my arms so long?

10:16.505 --> 10:20.165
Oh, my God. What's happening?

10:35.908 --> 10:38.277
Why are my arms so long?

10:40.266 --> 10:43.926
Oh, my God. What's happening?

10:45.373 --> 10:47.173
Oh!

10:47.347 --> 10:49.189
I'm not right.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.357
She's not right anymore!

10:51.358 --> 10:55.498
Something terrible's happened to her!

10:55.682 --> 10:58.338
This woman is desperate
to tell her story.

10:58.339 --> 11:02.296
So I'm doing something that I almost
never do because it's so dangerous.

11:02.297 --> 11:04.601
Ow, my arms!

11:04.602 --> 11:06.715
Oh, my God!

11:06.716 --> 11:09.016
I'm letting her jump
me, or enter my body,

11:09.017 --> 11:11.954
so she can speak through
me and I can feel her pain.

11:11.955 --> 11:16.335
She can't find what she's looking for.

11:19.476 --> 11:21.696
She's a mess. She's a mess.

11:21.697 --> 11:26.977
Um, she does not understand
what's happened to her.

11:36.111 --> 11:38.914
When you bought this place, did you
have any idea it might be haunted?

11:38.915 --> 11:41.450
- No, I was a total skeptic.
- Okay, so what about now?

11:41.451 --> 11:43.652
A lot different now. I
totally believe it now.

11:43.653 --> 11:45.487
There's something here.

11:45.488 --> 11:46.822
What changed your mind?

11:46.823 --> 11:48.578
Well, I have a daughter,
a younger daughter.

11:48.579 --> 11:49.859
- Right.
- She's eight now.

11:49.860 --> 11:51.710
She was in the front
dining room one morning,

11:51.711 --> 11:53.429
and I heard her talking to somebody.

11:53.430 --> 11:56.358
So I asked her, I says, hey,
baby, who you playing with?

11:56.359 --> 12:01.497
And she turned the other way and looked
up and then says, what's your name?

12:01.498 --> 12:04.972
She asked somebody there what their
name was, and she wasn't talking to me.

12:04.973 --> 12:07.905
- So, did she tell you a name or anything?
- Yeah.

12:07.906 --> 12:09.885
- What'd she say?
- She said Eliza.

12:09.886 --> 12:12.381
She said she wanted her
to stay with her tonight.

12:12.382 --> 12:13.948
Okay. Anything else?

12:13.949 --> 12:16.433
One time, I came in
through the back door,

12:16.434 --> 12:19.688
and passed one of our... just a
manager who was working there...

12:19.689 --> 12:23.428
And all of a sudden this loud bang
crash happened right behind me.

12:23.429 --> 12:25.628
Well, what we call our fish racks...

12:25.629 --> 12:28.941
Flew over his head and landed
in the middle of the kitchen.

12:28.942 --> 12:31.391
I mean, I was shocked. I
didn't know what to think.

12:31.392 --> 12:34.647
Now, do you think
whatever's here is dangerous?

12:34.648 --> 12:37.098
Oh, yeah. It's very concerning,
you know, it's very upsetting.

12:37.099 --> 12:39.380
Well let me ask you this,
would you be comfortable turning

12:39.381 --> 12:41.844
this over to your daughter
right now and then walking away?

12:41.845 --> 12:43.204
No, I don't think I would.

12:43.205 --> 12:46.325
- You wouldn't?
- No.

12:52.888 --> 12:55.480
She throws things.

12:55.481 --> 13:00.116
In here, in the kitchen.
I think that she...

13:00.117 --> 13:02.065
Is talking all the time.

13:02.066 --> 13:05.403
I think that they would feel...

13:05.404 --> 13:07.480
The pains.

13:07.481 --> 13:09.885
I think that...

13:09.886 --> 13:12.065
She looks...

13:12.066 --> 13:14.045
Scary.

13:14.046 --> 13:16.326
To people.

13:21.651 --> 13:25.611
She's trying to understand what...

13:25.718 --> 13:27.623
Is going on.

13:27.624 --> 13:29.604
She...

13:30.258 --> 13:32.358
Keeps...

13:33.063 --> 13:36.022
Seeing things that...

13:36.023 --> 13:38.483
Frighten her.

13:40.076 --> 13:43.676
She's getting panicked again.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.198
It's okay...

13:53.199 --> 13:55.539
It's okay.

14:04.098 --> 14:06.356
So, Doctor, you're Shawn's dad.

14:06.357 --> 14:09.064
- Yes.
- You're also a former Marine, like myself.

14:09.065 --> 14:11.000
You're a scientist,
as well as an engineer.

14:11.001 --> 14:12.501
That's correct.

14:12.502 --> 14:16.171
Straight out blunt, is there
something going on in this place?

14:16.172 --> 14:21.501
The unexplained events that
occurs in this restaurant.

14:21.502 --> 14:24.030
Well, give me an idea
what we're talking about.

14:24.031 --> 14:29.931
There was one situation in which I was
in the back, and I was cutting fish...

14:30.089 --> 14:34.159
And someone says something to me, so I
laid the knife down on the cutting board...

14:34.160 --> 14:36.806
- And I turned around to talk to him.
- Okay.

14:36.807 --> 14:39.378
When I turned back around...

14:39.379 --> 14:42.306
The knife was falling
from in front of me...

14:42.307 --> 14:45.266
And stuck in the board.

14:45.267 --> 14:47.704
I could see no explanation for it.

14:47.705 --> 14:50.005
I can't even try to debunk it for you.

14:50.006 --> 14:52.041
I find it very disconcerting.

14:52.042 --> 14:55.222
There's a entity here.

14:55.378 --> 14:59.578
Whether that entity is good or bad...

15:00.561 --> 15:03.021
Is unknown...

15:03.152 --> 15:06.776
But we don't take it lightly.

15:06.777 --> 15:10.197
She has to figure it out.

15:10.883 --> 15:16.523
Because when she figures it
out, it will all make sense.

15:18.787 --> 15:21.539
Please tell me what you remember.

15:21.540 --> 15:25.680
She's... And then I can't breathe.

15:25.830 --> 15:28.096
The woman that's jumped
my body is struggling

15:28.097 --> 15:30.613
to piece together
what's happened to her.

15:30.614 --> 15:33.883
She's gasping for air, and
I'm feeling all of her pain.

15:33.884 --> 15:36.353
And it hurts!

15:36.354 --> 15:39.654
Like, she can't breathe.

15:42.426 --> 15:46.566
I think this girl is being murdered.

16:05.140 --> 16:07.602
Shawn told me there was a
legend about a love triangle

16:07.603 --> 16:11.005
where a young girl was
murdered on the property.

16:11.006 --> 16:16.906
So, I'm on my way to meet with the
local Police Chief to see if it's true.

16:20.486 --> 16:23.126
My client said that there
was a female that was

16:23.127 --> 16:26.361
murdered on their property,
some kind of a lover's quarrel.

16:26.362 --> 16:27.862
Is there any truth to that at all?

16:27.863 --> 16:29.931
Yes, actually there is.

16:29.932 --> 16:35.832
April 30th of 1929, there was a young
lady murdered on that property area.

16:36.699 --> 16:39.593
Okay, so it doesn't sound
like it happened in the

16:39.594 --> 16:41.956
house I'm investigating,
but on the property.

16:41.957 --> 16:46.397
Yes. The victim is this young lady here.

16:46.555 --> 16:49.643
She was a 19-year-old
divorcee...

16:49.644 --> 16:55.104
Miss Lola Roller, and this
Doctor, Dr. Harry Dowling...

16:56.332 --> 16:59.822
Is apparently interested
in her in a romantic way.

16:59.823 --> 17:03.186
Chief, do we know if they actually
ever had a relationship together?

17:03.187 --> 17:05.265
No, indications are that they didn't.

17:05.266 --> 17:08.751
I mean, he was 48 years old, she was 19.

17:08.752 --> 17:11.123
She'd already told
members of her family that

17:11.124 --> 17:13.472
she did not want a
relationship with him.

17:13.473 --> 17:15.574
So, what does she wind up doing next?

17:15.575 --> 17:19.489
She leaves the Temple area, comes
to Waxahachie to get away from him.

17:19.490 --> 17:22.752
She comes up here, where her
Uncle lives, a Mr. H.L. Hempkins.

17:22.752 --> 17:25.105
And she stays with him in his house.

17:25.106 --> 17:26.685
He's a local grocer up here.

17:26.686 --> 17:30.957
So, Hempkins lived on the plantation
property I'm investigating.

17:30.958 --> 17:32.032
Correct.

17:32.033 --> 17:37.138
So, she's at the house, and Dr.
Dowling finds out where she is.

17:37.139 --> 17:43.039
And he is told by Mr. Hempkins that he's
not welcome, he's not gonna let him in.

17:43.371 --> 17:45.827
Well, Dr. Dowling forced his way in.

17:45.828 --> 17:49.963
So, Mr. Hempkins went
next door from his house...

17:49.964 --> 17:53.059
To his grocery store
to retrieve his weapon.

17:53.060 --> 17:55.944
And he also gets a hold of the Sheriff.

17:55.945 --> 17:59.153
So, Chief, when the Uncle and the
Sheriff come back to the house...

17:59.154 --> 18:03.290
- Is she already dead, what's going on?
- No, she's not dead at that time.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.438
They find that Dowling and her

18:05.439 --> 18:11.339
are involved in a physical
altercation going on at that time.

18:17.071 --> 18:18.824
She feels like something's missing.

18:18.825 --> 18:21.235
There's something missing.

18:21.236 --> 18:24.067
A person, she's trying to find a person.

18:24.068 --> 18:27.482
I hear the men, they're talking.

18:27.483 --> 18:30.543
But it was too late.

18:31.076 --> 18:35.336
There's, like, three... three of them.

18:36.925 --> 18:39.385
I feel pain.

18:39.966 --> 18:42.846
Some kind of pain.

18:44.392 --> 18:48.402
The Sheriff can see that
Dr. Dowling has a weapon.

18:48.403 --> 18:52.821
The Sheriff tries to get the
gun away from Dr. Dowling.

18:52.822 --> 18:54.489
But he's unsuccessful.

18:54.490 --> 18:58.062
And Dr. Dowling fires three
shots at the victim, Miss Lola.

18:58.063 --> 18:58.912
Okay.

18:58.913 --> 19:03.833
Hits her once in the
head, twice in the body.

19:05.849 --> 19:08.549
Oh, God [Bleep]!

19:09.342 --> 19:14.395
She can't move. She's so angry,
she can't move her [Bleep] legs.

19:14.396 --> 19:16.217
I see...

19:16.218 --> 19:18.549
How much it hurts.

19:18.550 --> 19:22.270
Uh, and then I can't breathe.

19:23.099 --> 19:27.359
I can't get the breath into my body.

19:28.586 --> 19:31.106
And it hurts.

19:31.160 --> 19:35.240
She thinks that she might be dying.

19:41.474 --> 19:43.505
What happens next?

19:43.506 --> 19:48.701
Well, Mr. Hempkins, from behind
the Sheriff, shoots Dr. Dowling.

19:48.702 --> 19:50.425
And hits him in the head.

19:50.426 --> 19:54.782
But there's also some question
that the good Doctor...

19:54.783 --> 19:58.247
Had intended something, or
knew something might happen.

19:58.248 --> 20:00.344
Because in his wallet was found a note,

20:00.345 --> 20:04.046
that in case something happens,
contact either one of these two people.

20:04.047 --> 20:07.140
Because I'm going to go get
the only woman I've ever loved.

20:07.141 --> 20:10.311
Chief, this sounds like this must've
been some huge case back then.

20:10.312 --> 20:13.669
Well, it was a pretty good-sized case,
obviously at that particular time,

20:13.670 --> 20:18.355
but it's not the only one involving
ladies that have been killed in that area,

20:18.356 --> 20:23.936
within one mile of the place
that you're talking about.

20:36.275 --> 20:39.711
The story of Lola's murder is like
something right out of a movie.

20:39.712 --> 20:41.906
It's hard to believe
there's several other cases

20:41.907 --> 20:44.650
similar to that within a
mile of Shawn's restaurant.

20:44.651 --> 20:47.220
I'm heading over to meet with
the County Sheriff, who's done the

20:47.221 --> 20:53.121
research on those cases, and he
said it will definitely help my case.

20:57.796 --> 21:00.439
You mentioned you found some
more cases very close to the

21:00.440 --> 21:03.713
property I'm investigating,
similar to the Roller homicide.

21:03.714 --> 21:05.913
- We did.
- Okay, what were you able to find out?

21:05.914 --> 21:10.207
Ernest Feray, a 56-year-old
man, shot his wife, Amanda.

21:10.208 --> 21:13.456
He shot her in the head
for throwing a vase at him.

21:13.457 --> 21:15.753
Here's a picture of him in an article.

21:15.754 --> 21:18.660
How far from the Catfish
Plantation did this homicide happen?

21:18.661 --> 21:20.357
It's approximately.8 of a mile.

21:20.358 --> 21:23.351
- Okay, so pretty close.
- Yes, Sir.

21:23.352 --> 21:25.547
- Was there any other cases?
- Yes.

21:25.548 --> 21:27.828
In 1914...

21:28.429 --> 21:32.954
Thomas Hastings shot his 18-year-old wife,
mable, and then turned the gun on himself.

21:32.955 --> 21:38.075
And they were both found in the
kitchen area of their apartment.

21:38.076 --> 21:40.443
And how far from the plantation is this?

21:40.444 --> 21:43.521
- This one was.7 of a mile, I believe.
- Okay.

21:43.522 --> 21:46.179
Then, we had another one that was

21:46.180 --> 21:49.180
approximately two blocks
from the Catfish Plantation.

21:49.181 --> 21:54.663
On this one here is Charles
Allverson and his wife, Maggie.

21:54.664 --> 21:56.978
Maggie was taking
medication for an illness,

21:56.979 --> 22:01.902
and her husband, Charles, decided
to mix strychnine in the medication.

22:01.903 --> 22:04.803
She died of a stomach poisoning.

22:04.804 --> 22:08.139
This is another female
murdered by the husband.

22:08.140 --> 22:10.125
You find this unusual
when you read about this?

22:10.126 --> 22:11.229
Yes.

22:11.230 --> 22:14.567
We have between 8 and
10 homicides a year.

22:14.568 --> 22:17.580
And that's 990-square-miles.

22:17.581 --> 22:20.621
Right. And these are four homicides
within a mile of the Catfish Plantation.

22:20.622 --> 22:24.162
- Yep.
- That's interesting.

22:25.612 --> 22:29.332
There's, um, a lot of people.

22:29.655 --> 22:32.895
Um, and it's not safe.

22:33.166 --> 22:36.818
Letting the murdered girl jump
me took almost all of my energy.

22:36.819 --> 22:38.886
But now that she's out of my body,

22:38.887 --> 22:41.901
there are other dead here
who are trying to communicate.

22:41.902 --> 22:47.242
Something's happening, and
this woman's freaking out.

22:47.927 --> 22:51.611
There's a lot of stomach pain.

22:51.612 --> 22:55.019
Someone's saying, self-inflicted.

22:55.020 --> 23:00.240
There was some kind of
love going on or something.

23:00.736 --> 23:05.405
And it was horrible,
and it ended horribly.

23:05.406 --> 23:07.266
Ugh.

23:10.231 --> 23:12.904
Now that I know four women were
murdered within a mile of my

23:12.905 --> 23:16.436
client's property, I need to see
if anything else went down there.

23:16.437 --> 23:20.337
So, I head to the local library.

23:21.573 --> 23:24.963
Searching through the archives, I
discover a former Major League ball player

23:24.964 --> 23:28.452
named Paul Richards who used
to live on my client's land.

23:28.453 --> 23:34.353
Turns out, he suffered a great
deal of loss in his time there.

23:34.782 --> 23:37.265
So I reached out to a local
genealogist who says his

23:37.266 --> 23:42.606
story is filled with fame,
tragedy, and family feuds.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.770
The property I'm investigating was once

23:50.771 --> 23:54.177
owned by one of Waxahachie's
most famous residents.

23:54.178 --> 23:55.778
Well, that's true.

23:55.779 --> 23:57.727
Paul Richards was a baseball player.

23:57.728 --> 24:00.788
And I have a photo here of him.

24:00.789 --> 24:05.124
In that photo, he's a
manager of the Orioles.

24:05.125 --> 24:08.160
Now, you had mentioned on the phone
that he had some hardships in his life.

24:08.161 --> 24:11.080
Sadly, he lost a
brother, a half-brother.

24:11.081 --> 24:12.963
He was only 24 years old.

24:12.964 --> 24:17.423
And then, later, he
lost his father, in 1937.

24:17.424 --> 24:21.502
And then, Paul Richards lost
his six-year-old daughter.

24:21.503 --> 24:25.138
Just three weeks before
his mother passed away.

24:25.139 --> 24:27.528
So, I would imagine
it's got to be tough.

24:27.529 --> 24:31.277
Very hard, but he and his mother
sometimes weren't on the best of terms.

24:31.278 --> 24:35.714
I want to show you this photograph
of her in her later years.

24:35.715 --> 24:39.750
Right after his windfall of winning
the pennant and getting some money.

24:39.751 --> 24:42.792
He had indoor plumbing
installed in his mother's home.

24:42.793 --> 24:44.669
- Okay.
- And, um, so...

24:44.670 --> 24:47.995
I'm sure he thought that she would be very
pleased with that, but when he asked her,

24:47.996 --> 24:53.896
she said to him that she would've
just as soon had a new dress.

24:53.927 --> 24:55.709
To him, it was very serious,

24:55.710 --> 25:01.610
and they were on the outs with
each other for a long, long time.

25:04.667 --> 25:06.075
Her son.

25:06.076 --> 25:09.556
She says that he's like...

25:10.211 --> 25:11.494
Money-hungry.

25:11.495 --> 25:15.254
She says she spoiled him badly.

25:15.255 --> 25:18.534
And so she's kind of, like, upset.

25:18.535 --> 25:20.949
Because he turned out that way.

25:20.950 --> 25:24.430
And isn't a better person.

25:25.885 --> 25:29.185
She says he definitely...

25:29.348 --> 25:32.768
Exploited people for money.

25:34.159 --> 25:39.028
And she's like, cause
I think he's the Devil.

25:39.029 --> 25:40.757
You have any idea how he died?

25:40.758 --> 25:42.443
He was playing golf.

25:42.444 --> 25:46.510
At Waxahachie Country Club,
and he died of a heart attack.

25:46.511 --> 25:49.391
At the age of 77.

25:52.751 --> 25:56.262
I am getting a lot
of physical pain here.

25:56.263 --> 26:02.125
Now, I'm getting, like... I'm getting,
like, maybe this is heart attack.

26:02.126 --> 26:05.906
Yeah, definitely a heart attack.

26:08.288 --> 26:11.648
I think this is her son.

26:19.900 --> 26:21.754
I'm having a sketch artist draw the two

26:21.755 --> 26:24.148
entities who stood out
the most from my walk.

26:24.149 --> 26:27.209
First, the old woman.

26:28.085 --> 26:29.860
She was...

26:29.861 --> 26:31.646
Probably...

26:31.647 --> 26:34.125
In her late 60s...

26:34.126 --> 26:36.466
About 5'4.

26:37.462 --> 26:40.522
She had smaller eyes.

26:41.604 --> 26:43.611
Almond-shaped.

26:43.612 --> 26:49.009
Next, the woman who jumped me, and
how she projects herself to the living.

26:49.010 --> 26:52.273
She's kind of disfigured.

26:52.274 --> 26:54.846
Her arms are...

26:54.847 --> 26:56.506
Too long.

26:56.507 --> 26:59.527
And her hair is like
sticking in clumps...

26:59.528 --> 27:02.768
Out away from her head.

27:05.494 --> 27:08.614
Is this what you saw?

27:09.791 --> 27:11.651
Yes.

27:32.039 --> 27:34.540
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigations,

27:34.541 --> 27:39.113
it's time to reveal our findings to our
clients and each other for the first time.

27:39.114 --> 27:41.048
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Shawn and David.

27:41.049 --> 27:42.330
They're married.

27:42.331 --> 27:45.348
They're part owners of the
Catfish Plantation restaurant.

27:45.349 --> 27:46.883
It's a family business.

27:46.884 --> 27:50.487
Actually, her parents work there,
as well as your 16-year-old daughter.

27:50.488 --> 27:52.122
And that's where the problem comes in.

27:52.123 --> 27:56.195
There's a lot of activity in this
place, and their concern is...

27:56.196 --> 27:59.219
Is it safe for them, their
family, and their guests?

27:59.220 --> 28:02.469
And, they would like to eventually
turn it over to their kids.

28:02.470 --> 28:05.400
They called us in to see if
there's a solution for it.

28:05.401 --> 28:11.301
So, with that, I'm gonna have Amy
tell us a little bit about her walk.

28:13.076 --> 28:17.013
When I went in, these two dead
people met me right at the door.

28:17.014 --> 28:22.419
It was an elderly little lady,
and a male who might be her son.

28:22.420 --> 28:25.175
And she told me...

28:25.176 --> 28:27.051
That he is...

28:27.052 --> 28:29.881
Not a very nice person.

28:29.882 --> 28:32.898
He was very money-hungry.

28:32.899 --> 28:37.227
And then, I was feeling
symptoms of a heart attack.

28:37.228 --> 28:40.653
As far as interactions with the living.

28:40.654 --> 28:44.778
People might see them as apparitions.

28:44.779 --> 28:48.028
One day, we were at the restaurant, our
youngest daughter was up there with us,

28:48.029 --> 28:50.780
and she was in the front
playing, just being a kid.

28:50.781 --> 28:53.160
And I came around the corner,
I could hear her talking,

28:53.161 --> 28:56.403
and it was an imaginary
friend, I'm sure.

28:56.404 --> 28:59.588
And as I listened to her for a few
moments, some of the things she was saying

28:59.589 --> 29:03.351
made me believe that it was almost like
a motherly or a grandmother-type figure.

29:03.352 --> 29:05.629
Wanting her to spend the night.

29:05.630 --> 29:07.312
Interesting.

29:07.313 --> 29:10.122
Now, I wanted to tell you
about the Richards family

29:10.123 --> 29:13.133
that lived in this
house for about 45 years.

29:13.134 --> 29:15.525
Paul Richards was a
mediocre baseball player,

29:15.526 --> 29:18.366
but a pretty good manager
in the Major Leagues.

29:18.367 --> 29:20.836
And he lived here in
this house with his mom.

29:20.837 --> 29:23.279
- Oh.
- I actually have a photo of him.

29:23.280 --> 29:26.400
This is Paul Richards.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.509
He had some heartbreak in his life.

29:28.510 --> 29:31.651
He had a 24-year-old half-brother
who died from Tuberculosis.

29:31.652 --> 29:36.317
In 1951, his six-year-old daughter
died from a tear in the heart.

29:36.318 --> 29:39.975
Three weeks later, his mother
fell, and she died a few days later.

29:39.976 --> 29:41.071
Hmm.

29:41.072 --> 29:42.956
Now, Amy, you mentioned
that the older woman

29:42.957 --> 29:45.617
kind of thought he was
money-hungry in life.

29:45.618 --> 29:49.690
Well, the mom and Paul
Richards had an argument...

29:49.691 --> 29:52.949
Over money and didn't talk after that.

29:52.950 --> 29:57.104
But after he wins the World Series,
and comes into some money, obviously...

29:57.105 --> 30:01.384
Um... he goes ahead and buys her
indoor plumbing for the house.

30:01.385 --> 30:04.854
She turns around and says, well, why,
you should've just bought me a new dress.

30:04.855 --> 30:07.666
- You also mentioned a heart attack.
- Yes.

30:07.667 --> 30:11.761
He did die of a heart attack, on
a golf course right in Waxahachie.

30:11.762 --> 30:14.042
Geez, wow.

30:14.505 --> 30:17.982
Now, I have a picture of his
mom, Sarah, when she was older.

30:17.983 --> 30:22.972
It couldn't have been too
long before she passed, either.

30:22.973 --> 30:26.753
I have a younger photo of her.

30:27.478 --> 30:29.379
What a difference.

30:29.380 --> 30:31.099
- We've seen her.
- Really?

30:31.100 --> 30:32.439
Mm-hmm.

30:32.440 --> 30:35.740
That's giving me chills.

30:35.953 --> 30:39.853
I saw her in between these ages.

30:40.458 --> 30:42.663
And I did do a sketch of her.

30:42.664 --> 30:44.944
All right.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.836
Well, you guys take a look.

30:52.837 --> 30:56.137
- Mm hmm.
- Holy smokes.

30:58.968 --> 31:00.828
Wow.

31:01.113 --> 31:03.581
They're very similar.

31:03.582 --> 31:06.981
The hair is, you know, right on.

31:06.982 --> 31:10.439
The brow, and the ridge line right
there, right above the nose...

31:10.440 --> 31:14.160
All seem to be very right on.

31:14.356 --> 31:18.861
- You think this is who you might've seen?
- Probably, yeah.

31:18.862 --> 31:23.549
She was showing me a
lot of different scenes.

31:23.550 --> 31:26.957
Or situations that she
had seen in her life.

31:26.958 --> 31:32.124
What I could see and make out of
them, ended, like, with people dead.

31:32.125 --> 31:35.697
The one that I could make the most...

31:35.698 --> 31:39.383
Sense out of was about a female.

31:39.384 --> 31:44.006
I started getting really
bad stomach pains, and...

31:44.007 --> 31:48.125
Someone out of these dead people
said that it was self-inflicted.

31:48.126 --> 31:53.330
There was love involved, and
that it ended just horribly.

31:53.331 --> 31:58.134
From 1914 to 1929, there
were four women murdered...

31:58.135 --> 32:01.862
- What? What?
- Within a mile radius of the restaurant.

32:01.863 --> 32:06.095
Now, I think the murder you're talking
about is this woman, Maggie Allverson.

32:06.096 --> 32:08.711
She had been sick with
some stomach ailments...

32:08.712 --> 32:11.614
- Okay.
- And she was taking medication.

32:11.615 --> 32:15.664
Her husband, Charles, decided to
mix the medication with strychnine.

32:15.665 --> 32:18.199
And wound up killing her with it.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.208
Now...

32:19.209 --> 32:21.123
- Nice.
- Yeah.

32:21.124 --> 32:24.093
This is her death certificate
here, Maggie Allverson.

32:24.094 --> 32:27.429
She was about 40 years old when she died.
He was a little bit younger. He was 34.

32:27.430 --> 32:29.098
This only happened two blocks...

32:29.099 --> 32:31.567
- Oh!
- From the restaurant.

32:31.568 --> 32:34.787
It was close. So she probably knew her.

32:34.788 --> 32:37.768
I mean, it's a small town, everybody
knows everybody in this size town.

32:37.769 --> 32:39.231
- Yes.
- Wow. Hmm.

32:39.232 --> 32:42.712
Makes so much sense to me.

32:43.126 --> 32:44.701
What else you see?

32:44.702 --> 32:48.018
I was in the bathroom area.

32:48.019 --> 32:52.918
And I started to get this
really intense, negative feeling,

32:52.919 --> 32:55.809
like when you're almost
in a car accident.

32:55.810 --> 32:57.874
I felt a woman near me.

32:57.875 --> 33:02.167
And then I did something
that I very rarely do...

33:02.168 --> 33:05.408
And I let her jump me.

33:06.844 --> 33:11.802
She stayed with me for
about a half an hour or so.

33:11.803 --> 33:12.779
Wow.

33:12.780 --> 33:15.421
So, were you in control
or you don't remember?

33:15.422 --> 33:18.782
Um, initially, I was not.

33:19.251 --> 33:22.238
Is she trying to communicate
through you, or what was going on?

33:22.239 --> 33:25.816
Well, I can show you, because...

33:25.817 --> 33:30.497
- We have Matt's cameras.
- Let me see it.

33:32.910 --> 33:35.464
Oh, my God, what's happening?

33:35.465 --> 33:37.599
Ow, my arms!

33:37.600 --> 33:39.602
Oh, my God!

33:39.603 --> 33:41.570
I'm not right!

33:41.571 --> 33:45.231
She's just not right anymore!

33:45.741 --> 33:49.579
Something terrible happened to her!

33:49.580 --> 33:51.597
I don't even know what
to say about this, I don't

33:51.598 --> 33:54.033
like that you did it,
to be honest with you.

33:54.034 --> 33:57.019
What is this woman's deal?
What's the story with her?

33:57.020 --> 33:59.721
She's very confused and scared.

33:59.722 --> 34:03.502
She's constantly reliving her...

34:04.222 --> 34:06.238
Her death.

34:06.239 --> 34:10.753
She doesn't understand
at all what is going on.

34:10.754 --> 34:14.465
She was waiting, I think, for
somebody to come and get her.

34:14.466 --> 34:17.393
She saw some men...

34:17.393 --> 34:20.694
Um, come in towards her.

34:21.324 --> 34:24.078
- She said, I think I'm dying.
- Oh, no!

34:24.079 --> 34:29.183
Um, and then she was like trying to
make her body breathe, and it couldn't.

34:29.184 --> 34:33.563
I got a lot of pain here, in my neck.

34:33.768 --> 34:36.841
Um, and the front of my chest.

34:36.842 --> 34:40.195
So, I think at that point she was
probably dead but still inside her body.

34:40.196 --> 34:41.663
That's awful.

34:41.664 --> 34:43.757
I think I have an
answer, but I'm not sure.

34:43.759 --> 34:45.731
Remember I told you there
was four women murdered?

34:45.732 --> 34:47.001
- Right.
- Okay.

34:47.002 --> 34:52.902
One of the women that was murdered, died,
not in the house, but on the property.

34:53.034 --> 34:55.643
Back in 1929 on April 30th.

34:55.643 --> 34:57.978
Her name was Lola Roller.

34:57.979 --> 34:59.996
She was 19 years old.

34:59.997 --> 35:01.672
This is her.

35:01.673 --> 35:04.585
She lived in Temple, which
is about 100 miles from here.

35:04.586 --> 35:09.327
She came up here to get away from a
48-year-old Doctor. He was a veterinarian.

35:09.328 --> 35:11.147
His name was Dr. Harry Dowling,

35:11.148 --> 35:14.194
who fell in love with her, and
she wanted nothing to do with him.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.697
They never even had a
relationship together.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.132
She comes up here to
stay with her Uncle.

35:19.133 --> 35:21.401
Somehow, he finds out she's up here.

35:21.402 --> 35:25.906
He drives up, finds out the house she's
in, goes to the door, knocks on it.

35:25.907 --> 35:28.776
The Uncle answers, says, you're
not allowed in here, get away!

35:28.777 --> 35:31.879
He had a grocery store
next to the house.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.768
He went there to go get his
gun and then get the Sheriff.

35:35.769 --> 35:40.460
When they come back, somehow
Dr. Dowling got into the house.

35:40.461 --> 35:43.798
And when the Uncle
and the Sheriff arrive,

35:43.799 --> 35:46.832
he's got her and they're
in a physical altercation.

35:46.833 --> 35:49.128
The Doctor, he's got a gun in his hand.

35:49.129 --> 35:53.916
The Sheriff tried to gun away from him, a
fight ensues, there's a big fight going on.

35:53.917 --> 35:57.204
And the Doctor he puts one
in her head, two in her chest.

35:57.205 --> 35:59.125
Whoa.

35:59.140 --> 36:03.571
The Uncle, he puts one into
the Doctor's head and kills him.

36:03.572 --> 36:07.164
The thing that really
bothers her is that she...

36:07.165 --> 36:09.783
Sees herself very strangely.

36:09.784 --> 36:12.316
She does not know that she's dead.

36:12.317 --> 36:14.621
To her, she's still fighting.

36:14.622 --> 36:18.125
- It's very confusing.
- It's sad.

36:18.126 --> 36:21.850
The way that she sees herself...

36:21.851 --> 36:24.834
Is basically like a shadow.

36:24.835 --> 36:27.469
And her limbs are...

36:27.470 --> 36:29.787
Extremely long and thin.

36:29.788 --> 36:34.434
I kind of thought that that's maybe
how living people would see her.

36:34.435 --> 36:35.238
Okay.

36:35.239 --> 36:38.216
Like a female shadow
that's kind of distorted.

36:38.217 --> 36:41.849
I'm having a little trouble understanding
how that would actually look.

36:41.850 --> 36:45.210
Well, I did do a sketch.

36:54.203 --> 36:56.569
That's odd.

36:56.570 --> 36:59.623
Take a look at that.

36:59.624 --> 37:02.684
Wow, I've seen that.

37:18.988 --> 37:21.928
I did do a sketch.

37:23.811 --> 37:26.211
That's odd.

37:27.463 --> 37:30.523
Take a look at that.

37:34.194 --> 37:37.254
Wow, I've seen that.

37:41.228 --> 37:44.888
This is very upsetting to me.

37:45.879 --> 37:47.807
It's a dark figure.

37:47.808 --> 37:53.708
That crouches underneath the
tables in the burgundy dining room.

37:54.932 --> 38:00.832
So, is it possible that the
shadow thing she's seen is Lola?

38:02.598 --> 38:04.458
Yes.

38:10.937 --> 38:13.075
What does she do? I mean...

38:13.076 --> 38:15.476
Well, she...

38:15.691 --> 38:18.498
Will break things...

38:18.499 --> 38:23.899
She'll throw things around,
especially in the kitchen.

38:25.756 --> 38:29.358
She is always screaming
and yelling and crying.

38:29.359 --> 38:30.814
Wow.

38:30.815 --> 38:35.195
- Can she become frustrated?
- Oh, yeah.

38:35.530 --> 38:38.622
We have our racks that
we use for cooking.

38:38.623 --> 38:43.126
And I was almost out of the
kitchen, and they flew off the shelf,

38:43.127 --> 38:46.907
and flew over our assistant manager's
head and landed behind... right behind me.

38:46.908 --> 38:49.068
Oh, wow.

38:49.892 --> 38:54.090
Now, one of the biggest reasons
we're here is she's been scratched.

38:54.091 --> 38:56.550
On her left arm.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.284
Show Amy where you were scratched.

38:58.285 --> 39:01.871
It was just right like that.

39:01.872 --> 39:05.091
Just like three fingernail marks.

39:05.092 --> 39:06.952
Wow.

39:07.279 --> 39:09.199
Yeah.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.331
That's her.

39:14.100 --> 39:17.224
The scratches, I think, are...

39:17.225 --> 39:21.555
Something that occurred
during the struggle.

39:21.556 --> 39:23.460
Okay.

39:23.461 --> 39:26.551
I'm very sorry for her.

39:26.552 --> 39:29.476
I knew these things weren't
just happening for no reason,

39:29.477 --> 39:34.277
that someone was trying
to tell us something.

39:36.789 --> 39:39.752
We still haven't answered
your most pressing question...

39:39.753 --> 39:45.287
Is it gonna be safe here for
you, your family, your guests?

39:45.288 --> 39:49.218
And, even more importantly, is it gonna
be okay for you to pass it on to your kids?

39:49.219 --> 39:50.205
Right.

39:50.206 --> 39:55.306
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:55.397 --> 39:57.979
We'll start with the mother and son.

39:57.980 --> 40:00.996
A local medium needs to come in.

40:00.997 --> 40:03.577
And talk to...

40:03.724 --> 40:05.584
Her.

40:05.818 --> 40:08.491
You know, she has so much anger.

40:08.492 --> 40:12.601
She needs to talk about,
you know, her life.

40:12.602 --> 40:14.813
And the things that
are keeping her here.

40:14.814 --> 40:15.931
Okay.

40:15.932 --> 40:18.619
Once these two have spoken.

40:18.620 --> 40:21.650
Let the medium do whatever they need to.

40:21.651 --> 40:25.573
Um, to make sure that they move on.

40:25.574 --> 40:31.474
As far as she's concerned, this
is a little bit more detailed.

40:31.482 --> 40:35.343
There are two people you need for this.

40:35.344 --> 40:39.514
You get another medium,
and a grief counselor.

40:39.515 --> 40:42.948
So, they have to come together,
the medium and the counselor?

40:42.949 --> 40:44.253
Yes.

40:44.254 --> 40:45.463
Okay.

40:45.464 --> 40:48.366
The medium might get jumped.

40:48.367 --> 40:52.956
So, they should take
this slow and steady.

40:52.957 --> 40:55.602
Um, with several meetings.

40:55.603 --> 40:56.742
Okay.

40:56.743 --> 41:01.770
By the third meeting, the
start of therapy begins.

41:01.771 --> 41:04.994
This is when the grief counselor...

41:04.995 --> 41:10.895
Will really take over as far as
counseling this person who's dying.

41:12.177 --> 41:16.125
We're dealing with somebody,
again, who is extremely traumatized,

41:16.126 --> 41:19.402
because she's never moved on.

41:19.403 --> 41:24.968
And at first, you know, things
might become more active...

41:24.969 --> 41:28.002
Because she might be pissed.

41:28.003 --> 41:31.342
But that should just be
temporary until she leaves.

41:31.343 --> 41:33.478
I've got to ask the question
I ask all my clients...

41:33.479 --> 41:37.356
Are you gonna take Amy's
advice and do what she says?

41:37.357 --> 41:40.685
I think that we need to
help Lola, definitely.

41:40.686 --> 41:43.400
Absolutely, cause, I mean,
it's almost terrifying

41:43.401 --> 41:47.610
just to think about
what she's going through.

41:47.611 --> 41:51.031
We feel compelled to help.

41:52.030 --> 41:54.768
Lola continues to suffer in death.

41:54.769 --> 42:00.159
But if Shawn and David follow my advice,
I'm confident she will be set free.

42:00.160 --> 42:06.060
And they'll be able to safely pass
their restaurant on to their children.

42:07.305 --> 42:13.541
