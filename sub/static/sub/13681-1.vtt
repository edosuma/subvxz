BATMAN: Gotham City, my city.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.891
Long ago I began my one-man crusade

00:28.080 --> 00:33.128
to protect her from crime and injustice
and then along came Robin.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.885
Together we were a dynamic duo of justice

00:37.080 --> 00:41.802
defending Gotham from villainous rogues
until young Robin grew up.

00:43.120 --> 00:47.565
He took the name Nightwing and set out
to fight crime on his own in Gotham.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.362
But that wasn't the end of Robin's story.

00:51.240 --> 00:54.323
A new Robin would soon join our ranks,

00:54.480 --> 00:56.801
strengthening our team
and extending the reach

00:56.960 --> 00:59.008
- of our protective cloak of justice
- (ALL GRUNTING)

00:59.320 --> 01:03.166
over every dark corner of our
beloved Gotham City.

01:04.640 --> 01:05.641
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Eh? Oh.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.085
(CHUCKLING SHEEPISHLY)

02:01.560 --> 02:05.281
Don't worry, Commissioner.
Batman and Robin are on the case!

02:05.560 --> 02:06.846
Thank you, Batman!

02:07.040 --> 02:09.042
With Gotham's
vilest villains on the loose,

02:09.240 --> 02:13.131
it's good to know our city is
in the capable hands of heroes like...

02:14.520 --> 02:15.567
You two?

02:16.560 --> 02:18.403
Gone again.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.920
That's it.
The last of the precious stones.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.766
The rest of them are only
semi-precious stones.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.651
Not even worth the time
it'd take us to steal them.

02:36.920 --> 02:37.921
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

02:40.520 --> 02:43.524
Time, Penguin, is the one thing
you'll have plenty of

02:43.880 --> 02:46.167
once you're back in your cell
at Arkham Asylum.

02:46.800 --> 02:51.044
But first, let's see how you fit
in my new Bat-magnet cage.

Penguin's-eye! (CHUCKLES)

03:02.080 --> 03:03.206
Good shot, Robin.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.761
That should keep him grounded
until the police arrive.

03:06.760 --> 03:10.810
And that's the reason
I'm always the designated driver.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.008
- Ta-ta, Pengie!
- (ENGINE REVVING)

03:19.480 --> 03:22.609
You'll be catching a ride
back to Arkham together, Harley.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.441

to a healthy environment.

Hey, watch where you're driving!

03:31.960 --> 03:32.961
Whoa!

03:33.160 --> 03:34.605
Not you, Batman, you're good.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.362
Poor Batman, you'll never catch me.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.649
But maybe you'll catch a fish.

03:45.840 --> 03:49.640
(CHUCKLES) Like shooting fish
in a barrel... Without the barrel.

BATMAN: (OVER SPEAKERS)
Give it up, Harley!

03:57.320 --> 04:00.403
You're wanted for grand theft,
receiving stolen goods

04:00.560 --> 04:02.608
and egregious prop comedy.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.960

I may be going out on a limb here, Batman.

I'm definitely going out on a limb!

05:05.720 --> 05:07.051
Poison Ivy.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.403
Keep your distance from her, Robin.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.131
Associating with common
jewel thieves now, are we?

05:12.600 --> 05:13.681
"Common"?

05:13.840 --> 05:17.927

will teach you the error of your ways.

- And help you turn over a new leaf.
- (WHOOSHING)

06:02.400 --> 06:04.448
Robin, cover these two
until the authorities arrive.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.047
Looks like there's one last villain
to wrangle.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.491
In Gotham, everybody pays bus fare.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.363
Aren't you the agile one?

06:44.680 --> 06:45.681
Hmm.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.691
What? Batman! But how?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.161
Quite simple, really.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.370
You uncannily anticipated
my every move as you fled.

06:57.640 --> 07:00.086
I simply anticipated
you anticipating my every move

07:00.240 --> 07:03.967
and adjusted accordingly, beating you
to the place I would've chased you to.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.007
Impressive.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.130
You shouldn't be too surprised, Nightwing!

07:09.520 --> 07:11.010
Aw. How did you...

07:11.240 --> 07:14.722
Oh, I bet it was my circus aerialist moves
that gave me away, right?

07:15.120 --> 07:18.249
As well as a few special moves
that only I could have taught you.

07:18.480 --> 07:22.201
Furthermore, I have deduced the reason
for your theatrical game of tag.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.967
As today marks the anniversary of
the first appearance of the Batman,

07:26.200 --> 07:28.726
and as most superheroes are
a highly emotional, sentimental lot,

07:28.920 --> 07:30.649
you have obviously lured me
to this location

07:30.840 --> 07:34.003
to set me up for some kind of
surprise party.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.890

- You shouldn't have.
- (GROANS)

07:40.720 --> 07:43.644
I can't believe
he guessed our plan. Again!

07:44.000 --> 07:47.049
You know, Batman, you take the fun
out of being your friend sometimes.

07:47.320 --> 07:48.321
How so?

07:48.840 --> 07:51.241
Happy Bat-Birthday, Batman!

07:51.440 --> 07:52.441
You see what I did there?

07:52.600 --> 07:56.002
Because you put "bat" before
"mobile" and "cave"? (CHUCKLES)

07:56.240 --> 07:59.483
The rest of the League wanted to be here,
but duty calls. Hey, look!

08:15.720 --> 08:17.085
Happy anniversary, Bruce.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.290
It's hardly happy for
the criminals of Gotham City, Diana.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.408
I mean, thank you.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.566
So, I know you don't want presents,

08:25.720 --> 08:28.690
but Robin, Nightwing and I all chipped in
and got you something,

08:28.920 --> 08:30.046
which is not easy,

08:30.240 --> 08:33.323
because what do you buy for a guy
who literally has one of everything?

08:33.720 --> 08:36.451
Batgirl, he can't literally have
one of everything.

08:36.679 --> 08:40.445
That's true. I've inventoried the Batcave,
there are some things he has two of.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.760
Boy, you are rich. Am I in your will?

08:44.159 --> 08:48.210
Anyway, we realized there's not
some thing we can buy you

08:48.360 --> 08:49.771
that you can't buy for yourself.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.885
So, your present is something even better.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.122
Quality time with us!

08:56.720 --> 09:01.282
You're suggesting we take a vacation?

09:01.800 --> 09:03.040
ALL: Surprise!

09:03.680 --> 09:04.727
Very thoughtful.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.730
Unfortunately,
crime doesn't take vacations.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.961
Gotham needs me.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.645
Well, of course it does!

09:10.800 --> 09:14.168
But you need a break,
and I'll be happy to babysit your fair...

09:14.360 --> 09:16.488
Fair-ish city while you're gone.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.126
I don't know.

09:19.320 --> 09:23.086
The villains in Gotham are a bit different
than the ones you're used to.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.801
Well, sure, they're different.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.208
For one thing, most of them
don't even have superpowers.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.131
(LAUGHS) I don't think they'll be
too big a problem for me.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.641
Don't underestimate Gotham's...

09:32.960 --> 09:34.644
Bruce, Clark really can handle it.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.844
And the rest of the Justice League
is only a phone call away.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.161
Oh, come on, Batman!

09:39.320 --> 09:43.211
If there is one hero in this world
that deserves and needs a vacay,

09:43.400 --> 09:44.765
it is definitely you.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.322
(SIGHS) Fine.

09:47.600 --> 09:48.726
What? You'll do it?

09:48.960 --> 09:51.122
Of course he said the yes.

I usually hate the lime ones.
This one's way better.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.689

before his bedtime.

11:02.120 --> 11:06.682

I'm totally coming, too!

Positive reinforcement?
Self-esteem building?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.001
We talked about this.

11:16.880 --> 11:21.087
Robin, I think what Batman is saying is that
he can't trust Gotham City to an outsider.

You know this town
and need to look out for Superman.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.285

11:26.720 --> 11:27.767
Sure.

13:54.160 --> 13:57.607
BATGIRL: We're going on vacation!
We're going on vacation!

13:58.880 --> 13:59.881
(RAPPING ON GLASS)

14:00.440 --> 14:01.566
We're on vacation!

14:04.360 --> 14:06.681
Admit it, this was the best idea ever!

14:06.920 --> 14:08.968
Yes, and it's been quite refreshing.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.285
Time to head back to Gotham.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.330
Oh, relax, Batman,
you're going to have a great time.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.568
You'll never guess
what we've got lined up for you.

14:16.760 --> 14:19.286
Based on your excessive sentimentality,

14:19.520 --> 14:23.286
I theorize that you are taking me
on a trip down memory lane,

14:23.520 --> 14:26.046
retracing my formative steps
with the various mentors

14:26.240 --> 14:28.288
who helped me to become the Batman.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.090
Ha! Wrong! We're taking you on
a trip down memory lane!

14:32.280 --> 14:35.966
Retracing your formative steps
with the various mentors who... Gah!

14:36.120 --> 14:38.487
Don't be too hard on yourself,
former Boy Wonder.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.047
The only possible destination
in this part of the world

14:41.200 --> 14:42.964
is this tiny uncharted atoll,

14:43.120 --> 14:47.091
the home of my old instructor,
the venerable Madame Mantis.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.729
We've been exchanging emails
with Madame Mantis for weeks now.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.730
She seems like such a sweet old lady.
You're her all-time favorite student.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.081
I just knew you'd want to see her.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.801
"Sweet old lady"?
What did she teach you, Bats?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.048
- Table manners and etiquette?
- Ow!

15:12.480 --> 15:15.165
I think you could do with a lesson
in manners, sonny.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.926
Hey! Where'd you come from?
I didn't hear you...

15:18.080 --> 15:21.926
- Pointing?
- Ah! Ooh! Ahhh! Ow!

15:22.440 --> 15:23.521
Uncle! Uncle!

15:23.680 --> 15:26.968
I couldn't help but hear you
clomping around, bird boy.

15:27.480 --> 15:28.561
Madame Mantis.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.610
Please forgive the brash rudeness
of my former apprentice.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.803
His youth leads him to foolishness.

15:34.040 --> 15:38.250
He is no more brash or foolhardy
than you were, my former student.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.450
I welcome you back
with gladness in my heart, Batface.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.166
"Batface"?

15:43.520 --> 15:46.683
Madame Mantis, it is so good to... Ow!

15:47.040 --> 15:49.247
You lowered your eyes during your bow.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.523
Your easy life in Gotham City
has made you soft!

15:52.920 --> 15:54.160
Forgive me, sensei.

15:54.800 --> 15:55.926
"Forgive me"?

15:56.280 --> 15:58.886
Madame Mantis, this is Batgirl.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.083
Hi, we met online.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.882
And you've already hit...
Uh, met Nightwing.

16:05.400 --> 16:09.803
Allow me to demonstrate to these
young ones the art of hospitality.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.243
May I offer you some refreshing tea
after your long journey?

16:13.520 --> 16:15.409
No, no, no. We're fine.

16:15.560 --> 16:16.721
We had some on the plane. Really...

16:16.880 --> 16:19.804
Why that sounds just lovely,
Madame Mantis.

16:20.080 --> 16:24.244
Tea? Now that's more like it.
I would love some nice, hot... Tea!

16:24.400 --> 16:25.811
(BOTH GRUNTING)

16:26.000 --> 16:27.240
Please, Madame Mantis!

16:28.080 --> 16:30.526
On second thought,
I'm more of a coffee person.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.168
You want one lump or two?
(CACKLING MANIACALLY)

16:35.120 --> 16:36.360
- Ow!
- (GRUNTS)

16:37.560 --> 16:41.087
You must be the space between the teacups.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.041
Madame Mantis'
unconventional teaching methods

16:44.240 --> 16:46.720
instill absolute situational awareness
at all times.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.206
You're telling me?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.804
And I thought you were a tough teacher.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.081
I did my best,

16:52.320 --> 16:55.449
but my training doesn't hold a candle
to the instruction I received here.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.046
You wallow in nostalgia, Batface.

16:58.280 --> 17:01.284
Nostalgia is the path
a fool walks to a pity party.

17:01.480 --> 17:05.040
And a pity party is nothing but
a stuffed bird in a cage with no door.

17:05.760 --> 17:06.965
Or is it?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.531
Yes. I see...

17:09.200 --> 17:12.282
Wait, what? What are you trying
to teach me, Madame Mantis?

17:12.480 --> 17:13.606
Only this,

17:13.839 --> 17:18.128
a man who does not expect a surprise
attack in the middle of hearing wisdom

17:18.280 --> 17:19.611
is like a worm who... (YELLS CRY)

17:21.480 --> 17:23.925
And you wonder why
I never come to class reunions.

17:24.160 --> 17:28.131
Come now, student.
It will be just like old times.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.971
That's what I'm afraid of.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.928
(BOTH GRUNTING)

17:35.480 --> 17:36.970
Go get her, Batman!

17:38.680 --> 17:39.681
- Ow!
- (BATGIRL LAUGHS)

17:41.160 --> 17:42.161
Ow!

17:42.960 --> 17:44.166
No giggling.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.930
You have kept much of the skill
you learned here,

17:48.120 --> 17:50.771
but you still lack
the ability to defeat me.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.641
Hmm.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.041
(GRUNTS)

17:57.320 --> 18:00.767
For your final test,
you must attack without mercy!

18:01.000 --> 18:02.126
Never!

18:02.320 --> 18:07.167
Either you destroy me or I destroy you!
(YELLS)

18:09.760 --> 18:12.923
Madame Mantis, stop this madness!

18:15.480 --> 18:20.520
The only way to stop anything
is for you to use the forbidden move!

18:20.680 --> 18:21.681
(GASPS)

18:22.400 --> 18:23.561
"Forbidden move"?

18:23.760 --> 18:26.206
Nightwing, what is that?
What's the "forbidden move"?

18:26.520 --> 18:27.681
I'm not completely sure,

18:27.840 --> 18:30.286
but I think it's some kind of move that,
for reasons unknown,

18:30.440 --> 18:31.726
has been completely forbidden.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.521
Thanks.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.650
It is the only way
to save yourself, Batface.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.769
No, stay back. This is my fight.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.203
And it's about to end.

18:50.560 --> 18:53.962
Ooh! Batface is finally ready to fight!

18:56.080 --> 18:57.081
(BOTH GRUNTING)

19:00.520 --> 19:01.521
(GROANS)

19:01.720 --> 19:03.210
(PANTING)

19:04.040 --> 19:07.601
Do it! Finish me
and your training will be complete.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.088
(GASPS) Batman, you can't!

19:16.240 --> 19:17.241
No!

19:22.400 --> 19:25.483
Whoa! Madame Mantis is really a man?

19:25.720 --> 19:27.927
A very, very, very, ugly man.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.244
"Man"? Hardly!

19:31.440 --> 19:35.843
It just so happens that I am a Trogowog,
and I'll thank you not to forget it.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.765
Obviously, I immediately knew
from your clumsy attack

19:38.960 --> 19:41.088
that you couldn't be
the real Madame Mantis.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.727
But I played along to find out
what you were up to.

19:43.880 --> 19:44.927
But who are you?

19:45.120 --> 19:47.122
And why did you impersonate
Batman's old master?

19:47.440 --> 19:49.602
(GRUNTS) I shan't tell you.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.685
I am an enigma wrapped in a riddle
wrapped in a stifling old woman costume.

19:53.920 --> 19:54.807
(GROWLS)

19:55.000 --> 19:57.526
What do your powers of deduction
tell you, Batman?

19:57.760 --> 20:01.281
I know only that he's working for a
highly-trained and well-equipped mercenary.

20:01.480 --> 20:02.641
How can you possibly know that?

20:02.960 --> 20:04.849
From the hi-tech smoke bomb
that just landed at our feet.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.009
- Uh-oh.
- (ALL EXCLAIM)

20:09.840 --> 20:10.966
Look!

20:17.280 --> 20:20.045
Just as I suspected. Deathstroke.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.970
Deathstroke? Here?

20:23.200 --> 20:24.440
Isn't he some kind of mercenary?

20:24.800 --> 20:28.486
Uh, yeah. He's only the most
deadly mercenary in the world.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.961
Disguised killers. Deadly mercenaries.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.971
I never thought I'd be homesick
for the peace and quiet of Gotham City.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.647
We mustn't lose them.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.571
They're our only hope
of finding the real Madame Mantis.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.330
Less talk. More Bat-pursuit.

20:48.440 --> 20:52.843
I guess I have time to brew
a fresh pot of coffee before he gets here.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.647
My goodness, Batman,
that was faster than...

20:57.840 --> 21:00.810
You must be Commissioner Gordon.
I'm Superman.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.809
Yes, I know who you are.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.566
I'm filling in for the Dark Knight
while he's away on vacation.

21:05.840 --> 21:06.841
Vacation?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.890
You know, Batman cannot say
enough good things about you.

21:10.080 --> 21:13.368
He's practically chatty about it!
Well, for Batman, anyway.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.529
Are we talking about the same guy?

21:15.760 --> 21:17.762
What seems to be the problem,
Commissioner?

21:18.400 --> 21:21.244
- Robin? I thought you were...
- Homework done!

21:21.520 --> 21:23.204
Time to fight some crime.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.407
It's the Joker.

21:24.600 --> 21:28.161
That madcap madman
has escaped from Arkham Asylum. Again!

21:28.360 --> 21:31.170
The Joker!
That's about as serious as it can get.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.562
We'd better contact Batman
and inform him of...

21:33.720 --> 21:36.769
What? And ruin his vacation? Nonsense!

21:37.040 --> 21:38.804
The Joker's the guy
in the clown makeup, right?

21:39.200 --> 21:42.443
He may look like a clown,
but he's no joke.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.809
Batman has a specific
Joker protocol to follow.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.840
First we round up his known associate...

21:49.000 --> 21:51.480
We are not rounding up anything,
Boy Wonder.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.047
Hello? It's a school night.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.083
A growing boy needs eight hours of sleep.

21:56.280 --> 21:59.966
I think I can handle this non-powered
clown all by myself, thank you.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.601
(GROANS)

22:02.600 --> 22:04.887
Well, if Batman must be out of town,

22:05.040 --> 22:08.010
it's good to know he left Gotham
in the capable hands of a hero like...

22:09.760 --> 22:10.761
Oh.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.929
- You're still here.
- Why wouldn't I be?

22:13.080 --> 22:14.764
I don't know, I thought you'd be gone.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.770
You were still talking.
That'd be incredibly rude.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.247
Besides, what if you said
something important?

22:20.520 --> 22:23.888
Well, I try not to save
any important information till the end.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.971
Never mind. Just go get the Joker.
And good luck!

22:27.120 --> 22:30.044
No need for luck, Commissioner.
Superman is on the case!

22:30.520 --> 22:34.684
I'll have the Joker back in Arkham
and Robin off to bed in no time.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.441
Come, Boy Wonder.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.365
So, that's what it's like
to finish a conversation.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.124
Hmm. Not bad.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.081
Hmm.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.888
Deathstroke's tracks lead here.
Just as I feared.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.926
Holy hole in the wall!

23:00.160 --> 23:02.447
Wow. You actually say things like that.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.483
I do not say "Holy" all the time.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.327
I said it a couple times back when
I was Robin and it became a "thing."

23:08.520 --> 23:10.966
I really never do it.
But, come on, I mean, look at this.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.043
We'll need the Bat Hover Boat
to follow Deathstroke

23:13.240 --> 23:15.641
and his Trogowog accomplice
where they're going.

23:15.800 --> 23:20.089
Where are we going to get a hovercraft
in the middle of, uh, nowhere?

23:29.120 --> 23:30.121
Wow.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.766
This sort of thing really shouldn't come
as a surprise to you by now.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.400
Listen carefully.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.450
Where we're about to go
will test the limits of your mind.

23:37.640 --> 23:41.690
What we're about to experience
will test the fortitude of your very soul.

23:41.840 --> 23:44.207
You will not simply gaze
upon the secrets and mysteries

23:44.400 --> 23:46.289
that lie beyond these walls.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.608
They will gaze into you.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.004
There's no dishonor in backing out...

23:51.160 --> 23:52.844
- I'm in!
- Let's do this!

24:05.680 --> 24:07.205
Joker, Joker, Joker.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.204
- Where is the Joker?
- (CELLPHONE RINGING)

24:10.440 --> 24:13.046
Superman's cell phone.
Superman speaking, how can I help you?

24:13.200 --> 24:14.884
- It's Robin.
- Hi, Robin.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.042
- Wait. Isn't it your bedtime?
- (ROBIN BRUSHING TEETH)

24:18.360 --> 24:20.283
(SPITS) Working on it.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.566
Have you found the Joker yet?

24:21.720 --> 24:26.760
It's not easy.
It's so dark and gritty here in Gotham.

24:26.920 --> 24:28.763
Metropolis is all clean and white.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.601
- It's easier to pick out the criminals.
- (JOKER CACKLING MANIACALLY)

24:34.640 --> 24:37.007
Bingo! There he is.
I'll have him locked up in no time.

24:37.480 --> 24:38.686
Be careful, Superman.

24:38.840 --> 24:41.684
The Joker is one of
Batman's trickiest foes.

24:41.840 --> 24:47.370
Yes, I'm sure a non-powered foe
can be a challenge for a non-powered hero.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.885
Gotta go, bad guy to catch.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.921
Oh, Spoony, isn't it wonderful?

24:53.280 --> 24:57.285
With Batsy gone,
all of Gotham is our own funhouse.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.807
There's nothing fun about crime, Joker.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.202
(GASPS) Look, Spoony.

25:02.360 --> 25:07.526
Batsy decided to leave Little Boy Blue
to watch the house while he's away.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.081
(MOCK VOICE) This is gonna be fun.

25:10.520 --> 25:15.447
Uh, yes, well, the only fun you
and your, uh, spoon will be having

25:15.600 --> 25:16.931
is back in your cell at Arkham.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.731
(NORMAL VOICE)
No, you'll never take us back there.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.962
Spoony will never allow it.

25:22.320 --> 25:25.802
Give up now, Joker. I have superpowers,

25:26.120 --> 25:27.610
and all you have is a...

25:28.120 --> 25:31.283
- A spoon.
- Superpowers? Like what?

25:31.920 --> 25:34.127
(MOCK VOICE)
Can you grow money from trees?

25:34.440 --> 25:35.601
Well, no.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.041
Can you make dogs invisible?

25:38.280 --> 25:40.601
Spoony, that's not even a real superpower.

25:40.880 --> 25:44.282
(NORMAL VOICE)
Perhaps a demonstration for Spoony?

38:53.080 --> 38:56.801
Holy garbage truck,
Gotham City is filthy with criminals.

Holy what? Why are you talking like that?

39:00.240 --> 39:03.130
Wait, you don't usually wear a cape,
do you, Cyborg?

39:03.640 --> 39:05.768
Uh. Yes.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.446
Yes, I do.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.763
And would you please call me Boy Wonder?

39:16.280 --> 39:19.409
Mmm. X-ray vision reveals...

39:19.600 --> 39:22.649
I believe we've found the lady criminal
called Poison Ivy.

39:22.880 --> 39:25.611
Holy horticulture, Bat... I mean Superman.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.802
- What do we do now?
- Follow my lead.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.682
We'll have this plant back in her pot
before you can say "evergreen."

39:32.640 --> 39:34.722
(LAUGHS GIDDILY) Not bad.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.922
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm afraid
your thieving days are over.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.371
Why, no. Of course not.

it's a land of perpetual day,

impossible to keep time, yet...

40:21.920 --> 40:22.921
We must try.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.600

40:36.000 --> 40:37.365
Madame Mantis.

40:37.520 --> 40:42.003
- It must be the real one.
- She's quite real and quite weak.

Here it is.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.924
Are you all right? Ow!

40:50.400 --> 40:52.767
Of course I'm not all right, dumbo.

I, on the other hand, am so very weak.

Oh, you're not so bad, kid.

41:08.360 --> 41:10.408
You take good care of Madame Mantis.

41:54.440 --> 41:56.488
Madame Mantis.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.927
That stone of theirs is strong.

41:59.080 --> 42:01.606
Almost too strong, even for me.

42:01.840 --> 42:03.888
Oh, this is all my fault.

42:04.440 --> 42:07.284
When Bane arrived here,
I was too weak to stop him.

- Also a little bit chicken.
- Nightwing.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.083
Prince Grungle
is clearly one of the good guys.

42:12.240 --> 42:13.605
A little respect?

42:13.800 --> 42:15.450
No, no, he's quite right.

42:15.640 --> 42:17.324
I am no real prince.

42:17.480 --> 42:20.086
A proper prince would've been brave,
put up a fight.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.130
But I didn't know how.

42:22.280 --> 42:25.011
We Trogowogs have always been
a peaceful people.

42:25.160 --> 42:29.051
We used the sacred stone
to spread friendship and love.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.483
Until Bane arrived.

42:31.760 --> 42:36.288
He had heard whispers of our existence,
rumors of our great wealth.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.565
Finally, after a long search, he found us

42:39.800 --> 42:42.485
and used the Psych Stone
to teach our people to hate.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.760
He destroyed my father, the king,
while I watched,

42:47.000 --> 42:48.809
frozen in fear.

42:51.240 --> 42:55.165
Now the Trogowogs are a violent mob
and follow a king of hate.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.603
Don't be too hard on your people, Grungle.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.404
Bane is pretty scary.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.403
And everyone is afraid sometimes.

43:02.920 --> 43:06.766
Bravery is just fighting for what you know
is right even when you're afraid.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.766
Bane's corruption of the Trogowogs
is a travesty of justice.

43:12.920 --> 43:17.562
As you know, Batface, my family
befriended Trogowogs centuries ago.

43:18.280 --> 43:21.011
We perfected our martial arts
to protect and defend them.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.807
I don't know how Bane
discovered the secret of the Trogowogs.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.687
Well, maybe you talked in your sleep? Ow!

43:27.920 --> 43:29.809
Batman, we've got to find a way to escape

43:30.000 --> 43:32.367
so we can liberate the Trogowogs
from Bane's rule.

43:32.560 --> 43:36.007
Hello, escape-proof cage,
confiscated utility belts.

43:36.360 --> 43:39.091
- We're all helpless here.
- Not quite.

43:39.720 --> 43:41.961
Deathstroke was so focused
on getting my utility belt,

43:42.120 --> 43:45.203
he overlooked the one thing
that can get us out of here.

43:46.640 --> 43:49.120
- What?
- He missed that?

43:49.400 --> 43:52.688
(SNORTS) I say, what is that?

43:52.880 --> 43:56.407
This, Prince Grungle,
is my Bat-brick separator.

43:56.720 --> 43:57.960
Observe.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.040
Holy crowbar.

I did it again, didn't I?

44:05.720 --> 44:06.846
Focus.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.651
Once I break through,
we'll have to move quickly to stop Bane.

44:09.800 --> 44:14.567
Because if we don't, no force on Earth
will be able to stop his Trogowog army.

he's going to give me "the look."

You knew the Psyche Stone would eventually
steal the forbidden move from your mind.

Deathstroke cannot and will not do.
