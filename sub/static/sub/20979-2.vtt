00:32.698 --> 00:35.619
[Eep] Who's the cutest carnivore
in the cave?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.829
- Is it you?
- [giggles]

00:40.290 --> 00:43.835
Oh, her feeding frenzies are so adorable.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.964
[Ugga] I have to get a picture.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.884
Hey, Mom, you think maybe we're overdoing
it with the baby pictures lately?

00:50.968 --> 00:53.720
No. Each one of these is important, Eep.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.682
After all, someday we might want
to remember that time

00:56.765 --> 00:58.767
when Sandy stared at nothing.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.894
[laughs]

01:00.978 --> 01:03.772
Well, how do I look?

01:03.855 --> 01:08.569
Whoa! Ooga booga la la!
Alpha male coming through.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.737
Nice power carcass, Dad.

01:10.821 --> 01:11.863
Thanks.

01:11.947 --> 01:15.200
I want to look dominant for my first
full day as Valley leader.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.868
And what says that better than

01:16.952 --> 01:20.330
"I wear more dead animals than you"? Ha.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.457
What's gonna be your first act as leader?

01:22.541 --> 01:23.893
Close school, close school,
close school...

01:23.917 --> 01:27.212
No, I'm heading up the clean-up
from the Broods' attack.

01:27.296 --> 01:30.048
Yeah, all their trash attracted
their pesky monkhuahuas.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.261
Hey! Hey!

01:36.054 --> 01:37.639
[laughs] Too slow.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.224
[chokes, screams]

01:39.308 --> 01:42.519
[Munk] Ow, my weak spot.
Oh, my weak spot!

01:42.602 --> 01:44.604
Wow, sounds like a big job.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.408
You sure you're ready
for all that, sweetie?

01:46.440 --> 01:49.693
Of course. All a good leader does
is tell people what to do,

01:49.776 --> 01:53.280
and then they do it like, uh...
Hey, Gran, take a bath today.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.531
[grunts]

01:56.241 --> 01:57.784
Bad example.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.496
[both grunt]

02:01.580 --> 02:03.749
[Grug] Shoo, shoo!

02:03.832 --> 02:07.085
Valleyites, these punkhuahuas aren't going
to quit eating trash here

02:07.169 --> 02:09.670
until we clean it up.
So after a lot of thought,

02:09.755 --> 02:13.550
I've decided we'll start
by picking up the, uh...

02:14.968 --> 02:18.305
big stuff, then work down to the...

02:19.514 --> 02:20.766
less big stuff.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.185
- All right. All right.
- Less big stuff sounds good.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.102
I'm hearing it.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.314
Ooh, ooh, Grug, Grug, okay,
are you sure this is the best way?

02:27.397 --> 02:31.985
What if we worked... Wait for it...
Backsies to frontsies?

02:32.069 --> 02:35.238
Yeah, or bottom to top. I got it.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.241
I think we should split the work
based on our strengths.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.703
Like, you're good at cleaning and I'm good
at sitting in shade, so...

02:41.787 --> 02:42.913
Whoa, whoa, guys.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.291
We'll never finish this job if you get
distracted by your own thoughts.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.086
So just do what I, the leader said, okay?

02:49.169 --> 02:53.548
But how do we not think of solutions when
we're staring at the problem?

02:53.632 --> 02:55.550
Snoot's right. Looking at this mess,

02:55.634 --> 02:58.261
an independent thinker like myself
can't help but...

02:58.345 --> 02:59.388
Crud's right.

02:59.471 --> 03:02.599
An independent thinker like myself
can't help but...

03:02.682 --> 03:05.394
Any more questions? No?

03:05.477 --> 03:07.229
Then everybody to work.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.480
[all grunt]

03:10.524 --> 03:11.400
Hey.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.317
[giggling]

03:12.401 --> 03:13.902
[babbles]

03:15.987 --> 03:18.115
Hmm? [grunts]

03:20.742 --> 03:22.702
Ah! [growls]

03:22.786 --> 03:24.704
[sniffs]

03:24.788 --> 03:26.039
[Thunk] Oh, good. You two met.

03:26.123 --> 03:32.254
Sandy, say hi to the newest and
third-hairiest member of our family.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.630
[whimpers]

03:36.591 --> 03:38.051
[Ugga] Newest member?

03:38.135 --> 03:40.011
Thunk, is that a monkhuahua?

03:40.095 --> 03:41.972
Yeah. Can he live with us, Mom?

03:42.055 --> 03:44.349
He's really nice, and I already
gave him a name.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.978
Not Food.
So you-know-who doesn't forget.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.146
[grunts]

03:49.229 --> 03:51.940
We got to take away Gran's rock stash.

03:52.023 --> 03:55.277
Sorry, Thunk, but we just can't
take in a wild animal.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.778
He's just too...

03:59.156 --> 04:00.782
adorable!

04:00.866 --> 04:02.325
[whimpers]

04:02.409 --> 04:04.369
Oh, goochy goo.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.624
[Eep laughs] Here, Not Food.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.794
What a cave wall moment.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.546
We don't need all these.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.257
[sneezes]

04:17.339 --> 04:20.343
[gasps] Oh, it's like his little nose
just said

04:20.427 --> 04:22.262
I wuv you.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.516
[Sandy sneezes]

04:26.600 --> 04:27.434
[Sandy laughs]

04:27.517 --> 04:29.237
[Ugga] What has gotten into you,
young lady?

04:29.311 --> 04:31.188
[Eep] Disgusting!

04:31.271 --> 04:32.981
[Thunk] Sandy, ew!

04:33.064 --> 04:35.317
[sighs]

04:35.400 --> 04:36.651
New leader plan.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.529
Instead of getting distracted
by your own silly ideas,

04:39.613 --> 04:41.406
you guys will follow me...

04:41.490 --> 04:42.991
blindly.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.076
Whoa. Flawless plan, pal.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.537
- That's a bush, Munk.
- Yep!

04:47.621 --> 04:50.624
Now this only works
if you stay blindfolded,

04:50.707 --> 04:53.919
so never take them off for any reason.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.087
- Oh, no, bear owl!
- Where?

04:56.171 --> 04:58.840
[shouts]

04:58.924 --> 05:01.426
Relax, I was testing you.

05:01.510 --> 05:02.761
[all laugh]

05:02.844 --> 05:05.305
[pants]

05:05.388 --> 05:09.267
So keep them on this time
and do exactly what I say.

05:09.351 --> 05:12.729
Okay, now, walk to the tree.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.609
Or walk to my voice.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.571
Now stop, stop.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.865
Now bend and grab.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.495
- Bend forward, Munk.
- Way ahead of you, buddy.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.288
Now take it away.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.126
And repeat.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.506
Faster.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.341
Faster!

05:41.424 --> 05:44.886
Ha! What'd I tell you guys?
See how great we're doing?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.555
Can't see a thing, Grug.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.974
Oh, right.
Yeah, well, just get excited.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.600
[all cheer]

05:50.684 --> 05:54.271
I can get excited on cue.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.648
Excited, Munk, not crazy.

05:56.731 --> 05:57.774
[grunts]

05:58.483 --> 06:01.987
Mom, could we build Not Food
a comfy little nest to sleep in?

06:02.070 --> 06:05.240
Sorry, we have
more important things to do.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.285
Like making him little pelts
to model for us.

06:13.748 --> 06:14.791
[gasps]

06:14.874 --> 06:16.209
Shh!

06:16.293 --> 06:17.752
[squeaks]

06:17.836 --> 06:20.005
Not Food, is that you?

06:20.088 --> 06:21.798
Oh, no. Where'd he go?

06:21.881 --> 06:23.508
[muffled squeaks]

06:23.592 --> 06:25.552
- Uh...
- [grunts]

06:25.635 --> 06:28.388
He... he ran away?

06:28.471 --> 06:31.808
Mom, come quick!
Sandy's mouth grew an arm.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.604
[spits, laughs]

06:35.687 --> 06:38.857
Not Food is not food, young lady.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.692
Go to your shame corner.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.239
[Thunk] You okay, fella?

06:46.323 --> 06:47.949
Sorry about Sandy.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.409
[gasps]

06:53.079 --> 06:56.374
Oh, he's like a little baby.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.168
[grumbles]

06:58.251 --> 07:00.378
And scrub and move.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.213
And spit and scrub.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.924
And move. And spit and scrub.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.761
And move. And spit and scrub.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.430
And move. And spit and scrub.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.058
- And move.
- [Teena] It's kind of fun.

07:13.141 --> 07:13.975
[Grug] Wow.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.186
I could eat off that ground.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.898
Which I do anyway, but this is so gleamy.

07:19.981 --> 07:23.443
Now that's what I call
great leadering, huh?

07:23.526 --> 07:25.195
Uh, put up your hand.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.238
Oh!

07:27.322 --> 07:29.783
High five, high five, high five,
high five, high five.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.285
- Butt slap, butt slap, butt slap...
- [all shout]

07:34.204 --> 07:37.582
Huh. They seem mad
we cleaned away their food.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.918
Or their body language
is nothing like ours

07:40.001 --> 07:41.711
and they're gonna give us treats.

07:41.795 --> 07:42.921
[all snarl]

07:43.004 --> 07:44.547
Boy, it's a tough call.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.093
Ah, the monkhuahuas are attacking!

07:48.176 --> 07:51.846
[laughs] Nice try, Grug, but we know
you're just testing to see

07:51.930 --> 07:55.058
if we'll remove our blindfolds again,
you big silly billy. Ha!

07:55.141 --> 07:56.893
What? No! This is...

07:56.977 --> 08:00.313
Okay, whatever. Just kick, punch...

08:00.397 --> 08:03.191
No, Teena, kick that one's shins.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.360
Oh, forget it. Follow me.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.443
[screams]

08:06.486 --> 08:08.321
[all scream]

08:10.865 --> 08:12.325
[sighs]

08:12.409 --> 08:13.493
[whimpers]

08:13.576 --> 08:18.248
[Ugga] Sandy! Sandy, where are you?

08:18.331 --> 08:21.251
Oh, no, she must've run away

08:21.334 --> 08:26.047
because we big people
didn't give her enough attention.

08:26.131 --> 08:30.135
Good thing we have Not Food
as our new baby.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.304
Yep, Sandy doesn't matter anymore.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.932
Not Food is the chosen one.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.309
[animals roar]

08:44.607 --> 08:47.027
[Ugga] Sandy! Sandy!

08:47.110 --> 08:48.153
Where are you?

08:48.236 --> 08:51.281
Sandy, please.
We're worried sick about you.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.366
Seriously. I've already barfed twice.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.743
[heaves]

08:54.826 --> 08:56.161
[giggles]

08:56.244 --> 08:57.787
[howls, crack]

08:57.871 --> 08:58.871
[screams]

09:00.165 --> 09:02.667
[sniffs, grunts]

09:02.751 --> 09:04.210
[growls]

09:05.920 --> 09:07.505
[chitters]

09:18.516 --> 09:19.976
[laughs nervously]

09:22.479 --> 09:23.772
[screeches]

09:29.069 --> 09:30.779
[chitters]

09:36.242 --> 09:38.411
[screeches]

09:47.962 --> 09:50.882
Guys, you've gotta take off
the blindfolds.

09:50.965 --> 09:54.344
I was wrong to make you follow me blindly.

09:54.427 --> 09:58.598
It was a terrible, terrible mistake
made by a truly great leader.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.935
- Now please!
- Ah! My blindfold! Oh, wait.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.704
Hey, where did all these monkhuahuas
come from?

10:03.728 --> 10:05.897
Never mind that. Just fight back.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.857
Now start with the biggest ones and...

10:07.941 --> 10:08.817
[screams]

10:08.900 --> 10:11.569
Oh, actually, just do it
however you want to.

10:11.653 --> 10:12.529
[Teena pants]

10:12.612 --> 10:16.407
I'll start at the backsies,
and work to the frontsies.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.535
And I'll go bottom to top.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.455
And do not worry about this area.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.499
I've got it covered.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.042
Ooh.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.627
Way to go, guys.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.420
Now charge!

10:29.504 --> 10:30.964
[all shout]

10:32.757 --> 10:36.803
Death to monkhuahuas!
[yodels]

10:36.886 --> 10:37.886
Ah!

10:40.682 --> 10:43.476
Oh, you're too cute to smash.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.563
Enjoy it while it lasts.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.939
[sighs]

10:50.984 --> 10:52.068
That settles it.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.571
From now on, no more following me blindly.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.240
I want to hear what everyone thinks.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.994
So we'll have things where we can meet.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.580
We'll call them meet things.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.331
[all chatter]

11:05.415 --> 11:06.875
- I do like talking.
- Love it!

11:06.958 --> 11:10.420
'Cause after all, everyone has good ideas.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.338
Well, almost everyone.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.466
Ow! Gran!
Have you been here the whole time

11:15.550 --> 11:17.886
waiting for a chance to hit me? Ooh!

11:17.969 --> 11:20.471
- Look here, guys.
- [both giggle]

11:20.555 --> 11:22.807
[Thunk] Cute overload.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.226
Oh, the two of them together.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.187
We are gonna need so many pictures,
we'll have to start a new wall.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.357
Aah! Now show us a smile, you two.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.234
[Sandy and No Food giggle]

11:41.367 --> 11:46.456
Class, today I want to share with you
the secret to living forever.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.790
[growling]

11:47.874 --> 11:50.710
Ah, scratch that. Stomach wants food.

11:50.793 --> 11:54.213
Bring me chickuna,
crunchy bugs, jackrobat.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.131
You know what?

11:55.214 --> 11:57.884
Why don't you just take out a whole link
of the food chain?

11:57.967 --> 11:59.552
[all grumble]

11:59.636 --> 12:02.430
Just once, I'd like him
to finish that lesson.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.140
Hey, kids, I'll be home late tonight.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.434
You're gonna have to help out your mom
around the cave.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.895
But, Dad, we already have school,

12:08.978 --> 12:11.856
and babysitting, and baby catching
when Baby Sandy escapes.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.691
Uh-huh, that's good.
Sorry, but you know,

12:13.775 --> 12:17.320
now that I'm Valley leader, I gotta settle
all the hunting disputes, so...

12:17.403 --> 12:21.574
[grunts] Amber say split toad
among all hunters.

12:21.658 --> 12:25.620
Well, I say it's eating me,
so it's all mine.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.330
Uh-oh.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.289
[laughs]

12:28.373 --> 12:30.541
Serves you right!
[screams]

12:31.751 --> 12:33.628
[muffled screams]

12:33.711 --> 12:36.631
[sighs] I hate when disputes turn ugly.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.675
Work hard for your mom, kids.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.110
- [muffled screams]
- [Grug shouts]

12:40.134 --> 12:41.844
[both sigh]

12:41.928 --> 12:43.888
We almost have everything
on teacher's list.

12:43.972 --> 12:47.642
Jackrobat, pig rat, jumbo pig rat,
my hand.

12:47.725 --> 12:48.977
How did that get in here?

12:49.060 --> 12:52.021
Just need that bug and we're done.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.816
[chokes]

12:54.899 --> 12:56.401
[sneezes]

12:56.484 --> 12:57.610
[chokes]

13:03.408 --> 13:06.828
Ugh! It stinks having so much stuff to do.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.496
And not even fun stuff.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.289
I know. I'm so busy,

13:10.373 --> 13:13.918
what with my private not dying lessons
after this.

13:14.002 --> 13:17.964
Now, you find this strange,
possibly dangerous fruit.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.173
What do you do?

13:22.427 --> 13:23.427
Oh.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.763
More blood on my hands.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.306
[grunts]

13:28.433 --> 13:33.938
Yeah, and I've got my afterschool job
helping Womp with his not dying lessons.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.440
[grunts]

13:37.775 --> 13:39.569
You know who's got it all figured out?

13:39.652 --> 13:40.820
Slaks.

13:40.903 --> 13:44.574
Wow, what I wouldn't give just to
sit around all day in my own filth.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.243
I know!

13:47.326 --> 13:50.872
Let's slak, and relax all day,

13:50.955 --> 13:53.124
instead of doing this dumb assignment.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.337
[laughs] Thunk, we have to do
what the teacher says.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.673
We can't just not.

14:00.757 --> 14:01.674
Right?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.718
Only one way to find out.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.511
Let's goo this.

14:06.596 --> 14:10.016
All right, let me get this straight.
Instead of doing the assignment,

14:10.099 --> 14:13.978
you gave up and spent the afternoon
doing nothing?!

14:14.062 --> 14:16.290
- That nothing was really something.
- Yeah, it was incredible.

14:16.314 --> 14:20.443
But you children never willfully
disappoint me.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.112
You always at least try and then fail.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.072
[growls]

14:24.155 --> 14:27.617
My stomach is very disappointed in you.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.745
Go to Deep Trouble.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.664
Eep, wait.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.458
What would a slak do?

14:35.541 --> 14:38.169
Or rather, what would it not do?

14:38.252 --> 14:39.253
Anything.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.424
You're not going? But, but, but...

14:43.508 --> 14:47.220
no one defies my stomach!

14:47.303 --> 14:49.222
Oh, baby. Oh, baby,
Daddy knows you're hungry.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.141
Daddy knows you're so very hungry,
but just don't take it out on Daddy.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.018
Please don't. Don't! Don't take it out...

14:55.269 --> 14:57.230
Oh, no! No!

14:57.313 --> 14:58.481
Wow!

14:58.564 --> 15:01.651
Slakking got us out of schoolwork
and trouble.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.153
[laughs] It's like magic.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.280
You've gotta, like,
show us how you did that.

15:06.364 --> 15:09.742
Sure. The way of the slak
is a gift to us all.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.286
It solves everything.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.789
Have boring chores to do?

15:14.872 --> 15:17.917
The slak teaches us, don't do them.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.504
[Eep] Stressful afterschool activities?

15:21.587 --> 15:23.214
Like, yawn.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.966
[all shout]

15:25.049 --> 15:27.844
[Eep] Don't do 'em.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.053
[Thunk] Tired?

15:29.137 --> 15:31.681
Instead of walking, you guessed it.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.349
Take that, legs.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.435
[laughs]

15:35.518 --> 15:37.145
[screams]

15:39.772 --> 15:42.150
[laughs] Sweet drool, Thunk.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.609
Thanks. Look.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.862
I can make it dance.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.239
[Eep laughs]

15:48.322 --> 15:49.365
[Ugga] Hey.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.493
Aren't you two supposed to be helping me
gather swatty sticks?

15:52.577 --> 15:55.329
We were gonna,
but then we had a better idea,

15:55.413 --> 15:58.291
which, as you see, we're doing now.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.584
Eep, tell her.

15:59.667 --> 16:00.877
[snores]

16:00.960 --> 16:03.963
Guys, it's mosquitoad season.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.216
We need those sticks to keep 'em
from dragging us...

16:07.300 --> 16:08.551
[Sandy] Ah!

16:11.220 --> 16:12.930
[Sandy giggles]

16:15.266 --> 16:16.517
See that?

16:16.601 --> 16:19.353
Yeah. If you want me to see something,

16:19.437 --> 16:23.024
I'm gonna need you
to hold open my eyelids.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.818
Enough slakking.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.320
Get to work.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.323
Whoa! [grunts]

16:30.406 --> 16:31.616
[grumbles]

16:31.699 --> 16:34.160
- I can't get them to do anything!
- Enough!

16:34.243 --> 16:35.995
Hear me, hear me.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.622
Can you all hear me?

16:37.705 --> 16:39.999
Well, this meet thing is called to order.

16:40.082 --> 16:44.003
So there have been some complaints
about kids acting up lately?

16:44.086 --> 16:46.172
It's awful. They've stopped listening,

16:46.255 --> 16:48.007
they've stopped doing anything.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.967
Look what's become of my son.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.220
[all gasp]

16:54.931 --> 16:56.516
[all gasp again]

16:58.017 --> 16:59.143
Still pretty bad.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.895
Amber have idea.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.397
Put buzztles down pelts.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.775
That get Amber moving in morning.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.401
Here, watch.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.319
[screams]

17:09.403 --> 17:10.946
Ow! Ow!

17:12.656 --> 17:14.282
Huh?

17:14.367 --> 17:17.453
I'll handle this the way we handle
every time our kids act up.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.497
Tell 'em to stop 'cause we say so.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.165
Oh, and if that doesn't work,
we add, "Or else!"

17:22.250 --> 17:23.416
[Ugga] I don't know, Grug.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.628
This is like no misbehaving
I've ever seen before.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.673
Please. They're acting like that?

17:28.756 --> 17:31.551
Ooh, I'm quaking in my pelts.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.637
[whimpers]

17:36.430 --> 17:39.767
So, any more slakking tips?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.394
I can try.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.647
Actually, I don't feel like trying.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.899
Never did like trying.

17:46.983 --> 17:50.236
Okay, time to get your butts back to work.

17:50.319 --> 17:53.656
There's homework, food to gather,
mosquitoads to swat.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.616
Come on, I'm serious. Get up.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.909
'Cause I say so.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.536
[all mutter]

17:58.619 --> 18:02.081
Okay, you guys are making me do this.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.749
Or else!

18:03.833 --> 18:05.376
[muttering continues]

18:05.459 --> 18:07.962
What? That's never not worked before.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.880
Okay, um...

18:09.964 --> 18:13.718
Eww! You covered yourselves in goo?

18:13.801 --> 18:17.513
I like to think the goo
covered itself in us. A-ha!

18:17.597 --> 18:19.056
Come on, think, Grug.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.475
The answer's in your head somewhere.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.894
Just gotta knock it out!

18:23.978 --> 18:24.812
Is that it?

18:24.895 --> 18:27.398
Nope, just a bug.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.567
You seem stressed, Dad.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.360
Of course I'm stressed.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.697
On top of hunting and the family,
now I'm Valley leader.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.908
Everyone's counting on me,
and all this extra thinking

18:37.992 --> 18:40.077
I've been doing
takes a real toll on my head.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.163
We know how you feel.

18:44.498 --> 18:45.416
[Ugga] Grug?

18:45.499 --> 18:46.792
Grug, honey.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.086
[all gasp]

18:49.170 --> 18:51.088
Oh, yeah.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.883
You were supposed to stop them,
not join them.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.009
Some leader.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.385
Boo, Grug.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.554
Hey, I was skeptical, too.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.849
And I admit, being lazy
didn't come to me naturally.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.602
But once I got into it, I realized

19:04.685 --> 19:08.147
I have wasted every moment of my life
up to this point

19:08.230 --> 19:10.524
by not wasting it.

19:10.608 --> 19:14.528
Trust me,
this is how we should all live.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.868
[sighs]

19:24.664 --> 19:26.582
[sighs]

19:29.752 --> 19:31.253
What's for dinner?

19:31.337 --> 19:34.799
Well, no one hunted or gathered, so...

19:34.882 --> 19:36.467
it's dirt again.

19:38.761 --> 19:39.970
Mm.

19:41.597 --> 19:46.852
Hey, uh, someone, grab a thing
to thing the things.

19:46.936 --> 19:47.770
Hmm.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.897
Guess we didn't gather any sticks.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.857
Eh, we'll be fine.
[screams]

19:51.941 --> 19:54.151
Ugga? Hang on, I'll...
[screams]

19:55.861 --> 19:57.738
[Squawk] Hey, I was doing nothing there.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.700
[gasps] Oh, no. We gotta save them.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.493
Yeah! Uh...

20:02.576 --> 20:03.703
How do you run again?

20:03.786 --> 20:06.122
Uh, I wanna say legs.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.665
Legs! Yes.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.875
[grunts]

20:09.959 --> 20:11.043
We're stuck.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.547
Who knew covering ourselves with
purple goo could have a downside?

20:14.630 --> 20:16.674
I know. We'll use our arms.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.885
[groans] They're all weak
from not being used enough.

20:19.969 --> 20:23.347
Yeah. Also, mine were pretty weak
to begin with.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.684
You know, I'm starting to think
that all this slakking

20:26.767 --> 20:28.102
wasn't a great idea.

20:28.185 --> 20:31.355
Yeah. Or rather, it was a great idea

20:31.439 --> 20:33.733
with a bad part that we didn't think of.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.443
[grunts loudly]

20:38.404 --> 20:41.115
[grunts, exclaims]

20:42.158 --> 20:43.659
[Eep] We did it!

20:43.743 --> 20:45.536
Now, let's move.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.413
How'd you get clean?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.707
I hate you, you dumb goo.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.459
[shrieks]

20:51.542 --> 20:54.003
I didn't mean it. Let me go!

20:54.086 --> 20:55.254
Hey.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.798
You guys want to help us out?

20:59.133 --> 21:01.761
Let us go, you flyin' sacks of ugly.

21:01.844 --> 21:02.844
What are you doin'?

21:02.887 --> 21:04.263
[screams]

21:07.433 --> 21:09.769
[all shout]

21:09.852 --> 21:12.396
They're getting revenge for moons
of being swatted.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.274
Ha ha! Missed me.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.109
Missed again.

21:17.193 --> 21:20.613
[shrieks] My head!
My mildly attractive head!

21:20.696 --> 21:22.656
Hey! Hungry, are you?

21:22.740 --> 21:27.161
Why settle for gross humans
when you can have a slak snack?

21:27.244 --> 21:31.624
Goo la la, each one comes with its own
special dipping sauce.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.460
Uh-oh.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.129
[Grug screams]

21:45.846 --> 21:49.391
Ha ha! Take that, you dumb...

21:49.475 --> 21:50.475
[gasps]

21:52.186 --> 21:53.771
[grunts]

21:55.105 --> 21:58.067
Ha! Nice try, you stupid bog.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.486
Ah!

22:00.569 --> 22:02.905
Learn to survive gracefully, Dad.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.575
So much for our slakking paradise.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.245
Yeah, I won't do nothing ever again.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.747
I'm gonna start doing something
right now. Uh...

22:11.831 --> 22:13.374
[makes noises]

22:16.085 --> 22:19.004
Well, as leader, I say we compromise.

22:19.088 --> 22:22.424
Every five days, there shall be one,
no, two days

22:22.508 --> 22:24.009
for just slakking.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.762
Any more and we'd again
become too weakened.

22:26.845 --> 22:31.976
And to remind us of that, we'll even
call these two days "the weakened."

22:32.059 --> 22:33.394
What do you say?

22:33.477 --> 22:34.937
[all cheer]

22:38.399 --> 22:40.943
