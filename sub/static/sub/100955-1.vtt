WEBVTT

01:53.285 --> 01:55.356
Sir, come see this!

01:55.391 --> 01:57.496
God!
That's impossible.

01:57.531 --> 02:00.741
Something inside
must have killed Agent Tracy.

02:00.775 --> 02:05.125
Playback Psychobook's analysis
of the mission.

02:11.648 --> 02:14.513
Strange, a virus playing
against himself.

02:14.548 --> 02:17.344
What the hell
is his master plan?

02:17.378 --> 02:20.485
Keep this top secret, don't tell
the others about agent Tracy.

02:20.519 --> 02:22.590
Yes, Commandant.

02:25.766 --> 02:28.217
- Call an ambulance.

02:48.513 --> 02:50.308
Yes?

02:50.342 --> 02:53.552
OK. Understood.

02:53.587 --> 02:57.487
Agent D. T. Gagano.
Where the hell is your mind?

02:57.522 --> 03:00.628
- Sorry, Lieutenant.
- Move your ass.

03:03.424 --> 03:05.392
Alarms went off
at 19:16.

03:05.426 --> 03:06.876
A virus has taken
over the system.

03:06.910 --> 03:10.742
It's source code is hidden
inside a region of Psychobook.

03:10.776 --> 03:12.882
What type is it?

03:12.916 --> 03:16.368
- Soviet Union computer virus.
- Damn Russians!

03:16.403 --> 03:19.406
They are infecting
the whole system.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.410
- Hey, Magnus!
- Hey! Have a good mission, man!

03:24.928 --> 03:26.344
Lately, the Soviet Union

03:26.378 --> 03:27.862
has been becoming more
and more aggressive

03:27.897 --> 03:29.795
towards the management system.

03:32.522 --> 03:34.938
- Is something wrong?
-  Back... back pain!

03:36.664 --> 03:38.252
Status?

03:38.287 --> 03:43.740
Uploading to Psychobook
in five, four, three.

03:46.985 --> 03:49.677
I will be monitoring you.

04:30.615 --> 04:33.549
'Boys, the suspect
is approaching the entrance.

04:33.583 --> 04:36.068
'You have 45 seconds.'

04:36.103 --> 04:37.794
Block him with a force ring.

04:37.829 --> 04:41.729
'Impossible, he doesn't have
an implanted chip.'

04:41.764 --> 04:45.354
Shit, he's a Soviet! Put me
in touch with the Professor.

04:50.462 --> 04:53.362
- Continue fumigating.
- Yes, sir.

04:58.608 --> 05:00.541
I've got the virus source code.

05:00.576 --> 05:02.612
We need your assistance
right now.

05:02.647 --> 05:05.719
Send over the satellite.

05:05.753 --> 05:08.066
What the hell are you doing
in my house?

05:08.100 --> 05:11.552
Pest Control state company.

05:11.587 --> 05:12.864
What the fuck?

05:12.898 --> 05:16.592
I'm putting an end to the plague
in this building.

05:18.525 --> 05:20.043
No, these are a bunch of fake...

05:52.213 --> 05:54.146
Jiminy, we need support.

05:54.181 --> 05:55.907
Use Zeus Satellite
to neutralize him!

05:55.941 --> 05:59.013
'I need the target's
coordinates.'

06:04.053 --> 06:05.710
Run, now!

06:13.027 --> 06:15.478
- Palmer.
- Relax, man.

06:16.997 --> 06:19.655
It's time to die, Agents!

06:19.689 --> 06:21.726
Jiminy, he's on the water tower!

07:11.154 --> 07:13.502
What the hell happened here?

07:13.536 --> 07:16.228
The virus is striking again.

07:16.263 --> 07:20.440
It has attacked Psychobook's
advertising system.

07:34.971 --> 07:36.904
Now...

07:36.939 --> 07:40.011
OK, Malin, it's enough
for today.

07:42.910 --> 07:44.912
Your poor husband
has been waiting there

07:44.947 --> 07:46.673
for more than ten minutes.

07:59.099 --> 08:02.827
Come and have a shower
with me, boy.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.899
OK.

08:28.991 --> 08:33.547
- What's wrong?
- My back!

08:36.585 --> 08:39.864
Birdie, are you sleeping?

08:39.898 --> 08:42.245
I'm gonna hand in
my resignation tomorrow.

08:42.280 --> 08:45.317
- I'm done with the CIA.
- Are you sure?

08:48.148 --> 08:50.012
I love you, birdie.

08:50.046 --> 08:53.153
I love you, my little fly.

09:08.617 --> 09:11.792
'Yeah... oh!'

09:17.073 --> 09:21.043
'Ooh, yeah!'

09:21.077 --> 09:23.286
'Mr. Batfro!'

10:01.048 --> 10:03.292
'Stop watching
this Russian propaganda

10:03.326 --> 10:06.019
'and get your skinny ass
into the office right away.

10:06.053 --> 10:08.331
'We have a Code Red.'

10:08.366 --> 10:10.713
- Right now?
- 'Yes, right now!'

10:10.748 --> 10:13.129
What's going on?

10:13.164 --> 10:15.856
Where the hell are you going?

10:17.202 --> 10:21.793
I'll be right back.
It's just a moment.

10:21.828 --> 10:24.693
Thank God you're quitting.

10:24.727 --> 10:27.765
Duty calls, for the last time.

10:43.297 --> 10:46.128
Lieutenant Palmer, Agent Gagano.

10:46.162 --> 10:51.271
Tonight you will be facing
Operation Jungle.

10:51.305 --> 10:53.031
Please, Professor.

10:53.066 --> 10:55.724
The CIA believes
that the Soviet Union virus

10:55.758 --> 11:00.211
is planning a big operation
to take over Psychobook.

11:00.245 --> 11:02.696
After analyzing the piece
of code you brought,

11:02.731 --> 11:06.389
we've found an anomaly in
Psychobook's old abandoned CPU.

11:06.424 --> 11:09.220
Your mission
is to retrieve samples

11:09.254 --> 11:12.913
of any anomalous substance
found inside that factory.

11:12.948 --> 11:14.846
Any questions?

11:17.504 --> 11:20.887
How do we enter
the domain of the virus?

11:20.921 --> 11:22.820
Our hackers were able to track

11:22.854 --> 11:25.098
the Soviet Union
protection system,

11:25.132 --> 11:29.067
so we will drop
your avatars in there.

11:39.112 --> 11:40.423
You're talking

11:40.458 --> 11:43.944
with the President
of the United States of America.

11:43.979 --> 11:46.188
Commandant Alfons Rebane.
Estonia.

11:46.222 --> 11:48.362
'Commandant,
give me the update.'

11:48.397 --> 11:51.365
Operation Jungle will
be launching tomorrow night.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.437
Excellent!
Keep me posted, Commandant.

12:06.104 --> 12:08.866
The owners told me
we can visit the place tomorrow,

12:08.900 --> 12:11.765
it's just an hour's drive
from here.

12:13.836 --> 12:16.874
We could put the counter here
on this side.

12:18.151 --> 12:19.773
You see?

12:19.808 --> 12:23.984
- What do you think, darling?
- Pepperoni, fresh tomato.

12:24.019 --> 12:26.331
You are not listening to me.

12:36.859 --> 12:39.413
I think it's a good idea.

12:39.448 --> 12:42.175
Let's go there, little fly,
let's give it a try.

12:42.209 --> 12:45.040
Let's leave this horrid city
and try.

12:46.317 --> 12:49.872
But... I'm a CIA agent.

12:49.907 --> 12:51.494
Things are not so simple.

12:51.529 --> 12:54.187
So you didn't drop in
your resignation letter...

12:54.221 --> 12:57.500
Well... let's just plan for it.

12:57.535 --> 13:01.435
Plan it?
We've been talking and talking.

13:01.470 --> 13:04.404
It's been seven years,
my little fly.

13:04.438 --> 13:07.096
You don't give a shit
about my kickboxing academy.

13:07.131 --> 13:08.615
I do, but...

13:08.649 --> 13:11.860
But what?
I'm tired of planning!

13:11.894 --> 13:13.378
But, birdie...

13:13.413 --> 13:16.519
I told my boss I'll be leaving
by the end of the week.

13:16.554 --> 13:20.938
You can stay with your special
force, Agent Gagano.

13:50.553 --> 13:53.418
The system will be cracked soon.

13:53.453 --> 13:56.180
The old CPU must be right there.

13:56.214 --> 13:58.941
This will be my last mission,
Palmer.

13:58.976 --> 14:02.255
We have been saving up
to open this kickboxing academy.

14:02.289 --> 14:05.085
Big, famous kickboxing academy.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.570
Why don't you open
a pizzeria instead?

14:07.605 --> 14:11.989
A pizzeria? Me?
Nah, it's just a hobby.

14:13.231 --> 14:15.993
What about you, Palmer?

14:16.027 --> 14:19.065
- What about me?
- About the future.

14:19.099 --> 14:20.618
The future?

14:21.999 --> 14:24.242
Who cares about the future?

14:26.969 --> 14:29.040
Commandant, is the CIA aware

14:29.075 --> 14:31.698
that you're sending two men
to their probable death?

14:31.732 --> 14:35.322
Professor, no agent dies
inside Psychobook.

14:35.357 --> 14:37.911
It's just a virtual reality.

14:39.740 --> 14:42.674
Tell that to Agent Tracy.

14:42.709 --> 14:46.437
Are you challenging
my command, Professor?

14:46.471 --> 14:50.993
With all due respect, this new
threat is unknown, Commandant.

14:51.028 --> 14:54.100
Please, shut up,
they are right here.

14:54.134 --> 14:56.033
Don't be so worried.

14:56.067 --> 14:59.657
They can't hear you.
They're in there.

15:09.529 --> 15:11.600
Jiminy, we are in position.

15:11.634 --> 15:15.293
'Message from
Commandant Alfons Rebane.'

15:15.328 --> 15:18.572
'Lieutenant Palmer,
are you alone?'

15:19.297 --> 15:20.402
Yes, sir.

15:22.991 --> 15:24.371
Make sure it's the dwarf

15:24.406 --> 15:28.065
who manipulates
any kind of substance.

15:28.099 --> 15:31.758
We wouldn't want
to put you in any risk.

15:31.792 --> 15:35.244
'You're too valuable
for the CIA.'

15:35.279 --> 15:37.177
'End of the message.'

15:37.212 --> 15:41.699
Lieutenant!
Come see this.

15:41.733 --> 15:44.702
It looks like
the substance from the CIA lab.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.290
But that's impossible.

15:46.324 --> 15:49.362
The government has the monopoly
over the synthesis.

15:49.396 --> 15:52.158
Come on, take a couple
of samples.

15:54.574 --> 15:56.645
I'm starting to feel dizzy.

15:56.679 --> 15:59.406
Dammit, the substance
might be emitting gas.

15:59.441 --> 16:01.236
Jiminy! Gas mask.

16:01.270 --> 16:04.584
I need a mask!
Palmer, the mask!

16:04.618 --> 16:07.242
Jiminy, create a gas mask!

16:07.276 --> 16:10.762
Oh, this is painful, Palmer.
Please wake me up!

16:10.797 --> 16:12.109
Don't be a chicken,

16:12.143 --> 16:14.456
I will see you outside
in a few seconds.

16:14.490 --> 16:16.389
Lieutenant!

16:40.620 --> 16:44.348
Let's deactivate
Psychobook's monitoring system.

16:44.382 --> 16:47.592
- I can't do that.
- Do you want to die?

16:47.627 --> 16:50.112
I can't die in here, Stalin.

16:50.147 --> 16:53.426
OK, enough, I'm leaving.
It was nice to see you.

16:53.460 --> 16:55.290
Jiminy, take me home!

16:55.324 --> 16:57.430
'Loading the way out.'

16:59.294 --> 17:01.365
This
will only keep us

17:01.399 --> 17:05.196
out of the network
for a moment, General Stalin.

17:05.231 --> 17:08.337
Operation Jungle
is now in our hands,

17:08.372 --> 17:11.064
Lieutenant Palmer Eldritch.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.169
You know me?

17:12.203 --> 17:15.724
Are you kidding me?
I'm a virus.

17:17.691 --> 17:20.625
I know you better than yourself.

17:20.660 --> 17:22.282
What do you want?

17:23.870 --> 17:26.769
Help me sell the substance.

17:26.804 --> 17:29.772
You'll be very rich.

17:29.807 --> 17:32.534
I don't make deals
with computer viruses.

17:32.568 --> 17:35.364
Ahahah, you will!

17:35.399 --> 17:36.779
Look!

17:41.439 --> 17:42.716
Who were you serving

17:42.751 --> 17:47.204
when you fucked
Commandant Alfons Rebane's wife,

17:47.238 --> 17:49.551
you dirty bastard?

17:53.831 --> 17:58.146
Make the right deals
and I will make you rich.

17:58.180 --> 18:04.117
Betray me and I will
dismember you in the real world.

18:17.199 --> 18:18.235
Fuck.

18:21.376 --> 18:23.757
Try to wake him up, Professor.

18:23.792 --> 18:25.828
Sorry, but that's not possible.

18:25.863 --> 18:27.865
Shit.

18:27.899 --> 18:30.109
What the hell happened inside?

18:36.253 --> 18:37.633
Ladies and gentleman,

18:37.668 --> 18:41.775
Captain Lagucci
performing for you tonight.

18:54.305 --> 18:55.755
Yeah.

18:58.206 --> 18:59.655
Yeah...

19:01.519 --> 19:04.177
Lick this!

19:04.212 --> 19:05.903
Lick this!

19:13.807 --> 19:15.499
Asshole.

19:17.225 --> 19:18.881
Fuck it!

19:26.303 --> 19:27.787
Excuse me.

19:27.821 --> 19:29.892
You must leave right now.

19:29.927 --> 19:34.966
Do you see anybody else here?
Do you see?

19:36.002 --> 19:38.556
I don't see anybody else here.

19:39.695 --> 19:41.697
This show is for me!

19:44.735 --> 19:46.771
Ooh...

19:53.675 --> 19:56.919
Captain Lagucci is not dancing
for you, baby,

19:56.954 --> 19:59.370
she's dancing for the universe.

20:07.067 --> 20:08.345
Hello?

20:09.380 --> 20:11.589
Malin, it's for you, darling.

20:13.695 --> 20:15.317
Hello?

20:31.333 --> 20:38.237
Please promise, if he passes,
he must pass at home, with me.

20:39.341 --> 20:42.620
- Hey, I will try.
- Please, promise.

20:42.655 --> 20:48.523
Hey, I promise.
You see? I promise.

20:48.557 --> 20:52.354
I promise you.
Don't worry, I... I promise.

20:52.389 --> 20:53.873
Promise...

20:53.907 --> 20:56.738
What the fuck are you doing?

20:58.947 --> 21:01.674
That was not my intention,
I just...

21:01.708 --> 21:02.882
You're such a brute.

21:02.916 --> 21:07.300
What happened between us
was a big mistake.

21:09.613 --> 21:11.925
OK, that's fine.

21:27.596 --> 21:30.323
Create a mirror doppelganger
of Agent Gagano.

21:34.362 --> 21:35.846
Mirror copy created.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.606
Upload our copy into Betta
Ethiopia.

21:41.645 --> 21:44.544
Copy uploaded,
Comrade Stalin.

22:10.190 --> 22:12.538
Excuse me, waiter.

22:14.056 --> 22:15.955
What would you like to eat, sir?

22:19.855 --> 22:21.719
Just a pizza margarita.

22:21.754 --> 22:29.417
Pizza... mar-ga-ri-ta.

22:29.451 --> 22:32.696
OK, sir. Anything to drink?

22:32.730 --> 22:34.456
No, thanks.

23:22.262 --> 23:25.714
Huh? Shit man,
how unfortunate!

23:25.749 --> 23:28.786
It's the government's
fucking president.

23:29.856 --> 23:31.410
'Round one!'

23:54.571 --> 23:55.710
'You win!'

23:55.744 --> 23:58.885
This is the substance!
Vote for Batfro!

23:58.920 --> 24:01.716
Damn drug addicts!

24:01.750 --> 24:04.822
'Continue voting for Batfro
as your favorite president,

24:04.857 --> 24:06.928
'the chosen one to eradicate
the damn drug addicts.'

24:06.962 --> 24:11.001
Shut up! Not even your
own mother would vote for you.

24:13.003 --> 24:15.108
Don't you like the pizza, sir?

24:15.143 --> 24:19.941
It's fine... but the oven
is not heating the bottom enough

24:19.975 --> 24:23.703
so the base of the pizza
is too soft.

24:23.738 --> 24:26.637
May I have the bill, please?

24:28.812 --> 24:32.056
I hope you accept credit cards.

24:37.096 --> 24:38.718
Phew!

24:40.168 --> 24:42.860
Jiminy, priority message.

24:42.895 --> 24:46.588
'Trying to find a secure
connection, please hold.'

25:01.154 --> 25:03.294
Here is Agent Gagano,

25:03.329 --> 25:07.057
last known location was
the abandoned Psychobook's CPU.

25:07.091 --> 25:08.990
I paid with my credit card,

25:09.024 --> 25:11.613
you should be able
to track my position.

25:13.028 --> 25:16.307
'New message from headquarters.'

25:16.342 --> 25:21.554
'Agent, new position identified
as Betta Ethiopia.

25:21.589 --> 25:24.039
'Wait for instructions.'

25:24.074 --> 25:26.628
Come on, guys, take me home!

25:36.362 --> 25:40.090
Hello, sir.
This is Mr. Sophistication.

25:41.194 --> 25:43.265
Sorry for calling you so late,

25:43.300 --> 25:45.267
but, er... we have a problem

25:45.302 --> 25:48.650
with the credit card
in the restaurant.

25:53.621 --> 25:56.106
'Agent D. T. Gagano.'

25:56.140 --> 25:57.348
Thank God.

25:57.383 --> 26:00.248
'I have
bad news, Agent.

26:00.282 --> 26:03.665
'I'm afraid you're in
an irreversible coma.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.218
'We can't wake you up.'

26:05.253 --> 26:07.117
What?

26:07.151 --> 26:08.739
What the hell, Commandant!

26:08.774 --> 26:10.154
'What you're experiencing

26:10.189 --> 26:13.054
'is the last traces
of your mental activity.'

26:13.088 --> 26:14.883
'Something
must be wrong.

26:14.918 --> 26:18.024
'This partition of the system
looks very real.'

26:18.059 --> 26:20.337
You don't have
much time left, kid,

26:20.371 --> 26:23.374
although Psychobook is still
able to track your inner-voice.

26:23.409 --> 26:26.930
'You're wrong, Commandant.
I'm here!

26:26.964 --> 26:30.071
'Don't you see me?'

26:30.105 --> 26:32.038
Sir! Could you please
open the door?

26:33.764 --> 26:37.147
'I hope you are still able
to receive this message.

26:37.181 --> 26:40.081
'They told me
it will be the last one.'

26:40.115 --> 26:41.669
No!

26:42.704 --> 26:44.879
This must be a stupid mistake.

26:46.432 --> 26:49.642
'Your brain is fading, my love.

26:51.161 --> 26:53.197
'Rest in peace.'

26:53.232 --> 26:55.337
'End of the message.'

26:57.719 --> 27:01.965
Listen, birdie.
I will come back before Sunday.

27:01.999 --> 27:03.449
This is my last mission.

27:03.483 --> 27:07.280
'Listen, Agent, the Soviet Union
is planning something big.

27:07.315 --> 27:10.456
'Try to find out
before you wither and die.

27:10.490 --> 27:12.251
'Good luck and sorry.'

27:14.391 --> 27:16.324
Shit!

27:16.358 --> 27:17.705
'End of the message.'

27:19.776 --> 27:22.123
Here you are, you drug addict!

27:35.239 --> 27:39.312
You motherfucker.
What did you do to him?

27:39.347 --> 27:41.729
How can he die?

27:41.763 --> 27:44.283
All this shit
is just a computer game.

27:44.317 --> 27:47.010
We are trying to find out, lady.

27:47.044 --> 27:48.736
Bring him back to me!

27:48.770 --> 27:50.461
You go inside
that computer game!

27:50.496 --> 27:52.153
- Easy. Easy!
- Go and bring him back!

27:52.187 --> 27:54.949
Malin, please stop!
Please, please.

27:55.812 --> 27:57.192
Malin!

28:41.340 --> 28:43.376
Fuck you, Stalin.

29:09.506 --> 29:11.819
What is this?

29:11.853 --> 29:14.545
- My savings.
- My ass.

29:14.580 --> 29:16.893
Where did you get
a pink Mastercard?

29:16.927 --> 29:18.377
What's going on?

29:18.411 --> 29:22.001
Where's the money
coming from, Palmer?

29:22.036 --> 29:25.315
I was thinking I could help you
open the most...

29:29.871 --> 29:32.978
...the most beautiful
kickboxing academy

29:33.012 --> 29:35.877
anybody has ever, ever seen.

30:05.217 --> 30:08.289
Did you bring the goods,
mister man?

30:13.087 --> 30:15.261
Transfer the money
to my credit card.

30:15.296 --> 30:17.470
First the goods!

30:30.345 --> 30:32.589
Your money's transferred.

30:36.110 --> 30:38.388
- Stop! Police!
- The cops!

30:38.422 --> 30:39.976
Fuck!

30:45.257 --> 30:48.674
Look, dwarf, we have a problem.
This piece of crap is fake.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.572
In this country

30:50.607 --> 30:55.474
only one type of person
uses false credit cards.

30:55.508 --> 30:58.684
Can you stop
fucking interrupting me?

30:58.718 --> 31:01.445
Oh, I'm very sorry, sir.

31:01.480 --> 31:04.932
Do you want
to scare the kid?

31:04.966 --> 31:06.140
Hey! I'm grown-ass man!

31:06.174 --> 31:08.452
Put the gun away! Now!

31:08.487 --> 31:09.626
I'm sorry, sir.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.077
For god's sake!
What was I saying?

31:12.111 --> 31:14.631
- In this country...
- Ah, yes!

31:14.665 --> 31:16.150
In this country

31:16.184 --> 31:19.118
only the drug dealers
that work for Reverend Roy

31:19.153 --> 31:21.086
use false credit cards.

31:21.120 --> 31:23.467
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:24.986 --> 31:28.472
Please, Mr. Sophistication,
do your thing.

31:30.095 --> 31:33.719
- Who are you working for?
- For no one!

31:33.753 --> 31:36.308
Get down on your knees. Now!

31:36.342 --> 31:40.105
Stop! He's just a child!

31:46.283 --> 31:49.700
So... we have a brave man here.

31:49.735 --> 31:53.152
You're talking to a patriot,
show a little bit of respect.

31:56.362 --> 32:02.023
I will teach you some respect.
Lick my boots.

32:02.058 --> 32:03.991
Go ahead and lick them!

32:04.025 --> 32:06.338
You're a disgrace
to the country.

32:09.341 --> 32:12.206
Hey! You! Leave him alone!

32:16.555 --> 32:18.695
He was obviously a hippie.

32:23.631 --> 32:25.322
Fuck!

32:26.634 --> 32:28.256
What the hell?

32:28.601 --> 32:30.603
Shit.

32:30.638 --> 32:32.536
Fuck this.

32:39.819 --> 32:42.546
Prince, we are at your service.

32:42.581 --> 32:44.997
I'm not your prince.

32:45.032 --> 32:47.379
Come on, you're immortal!

32:47.413 --> 32:52.384
You've been sent to fight Batfro
and his false democracy.

32:52.418 --> 32:56.664
That arrogant president
is a disgrace to our country.

32:56.698 --> 32:58.355
'Error.'

32:58.390 --> 33:00.771
Jiminy, are you still
able to track?

33:00.806 --> 33:01.772
'Error.'

33:01.807 --> 33:03.636
What is that?

33:03.671 --> 33:07.330
The virus must be generating
doppelgangers.

33:07.364 --> 33:09.815
'Agent, Betta Ethiopia
is outside

33:09.849 --> 33:12.404
'of the domain of the virus
Soviet Union.'

33:12.438 --> 33:14.302
Record my voice.

33:14.337 --> 33:16.546
'Impossible to record
the message.

33:16.580 --> 33:19.687
'Inner-voice signal
too weak to be tracked.'

33:19.721 --> 33:23.553
Have you seen that sorcery?

33:23.587 --> 33:26.659
'Signal too low.
Signal too low.

33:26.694 --> 33:28.627
'Signal too low.'

33:28.661 --> 33:31.561
Jiminy? Jiminy!

33:33.770 --> 33:36.359
Wake up. I must wake up!

33:36.393 --> 33:39.120
Wake up. I must wake up.

33:39.155 --> 33:41.260
Wake up! Wake up!

33:41.295 --> 33:44.056
Wake up, Gagano!
Wake up! Wake up!

33:44.091 --> 33:45.471
Please, my Prince!

33:45.506 --> 33:47.542
You're going to hurt yourself.
Stop, Prince.

33:47.577 --> 33:51.236
- Wake up, Gagano. Wake up!
- Please, my Prince!

33:51.270 --> 33:56.310
Wake up. Wake up, Gagano!
Wake up, wake up!

34:08.908 --> 34:10.082
What?

34:10.117 --> 34:11.704
Sir, Mr. Sophistication
is here.

34:12.774 --> 34:14.638
Why did you let him?

34:20.299 --> 34:22.267
Hello, sir.

34:22.301 --> 34:24.372
My kung fu masters.

34:24.407 --> 34:26.167
Spaghetti.

34:26.202 --> 34:28.204
Ravioli.

34:28.238 --> 34:29.619
Baltazar.

34:31.759 --> 34:34.313
Tell them to bring me a whisky.

34:39.767 --> 34:42.770
What's your plan
for the dwarf, sir?

34:42.804 --> 34:45.117
What are you gonna do
with him?

34:45.152 --> 34:47.188
I will lock him up forever!

34:50.847 --> 34:53.505
- Please, sir.
- 'Mr. President.

34:53.539 --> 34:56.749
'The midget is more important
than you can imagine.

34:56.784 --> 34:59.821
'He's the key element
to strengthen our relations.'

34:59.856 --> 35:02.272
My dear Stalin,
are you talking

35:02.307 --> 35:05.586
about the military agreement
with the Soviet Union?

35:07.415 --> 35:09.452
'I'm talking about
a new agreement

35:09.486 --> 35:12.317
'to take over
the whole Psychobook.

35:12.351 --> 35:14.491
'The midget is a CIA agent

35:14.526 --> 35:17.149
'and can give us full access
to the source code.'

35:18.806 --> 35:22.189
What do you need
to organize this?

35:22.223 --> 35:24.329
'First, to crack the system,

35:24.363 --> 35:28.333
'we need to get our hands
on the most powerful terminal.

35:28.367 --> 35:31.819
'The Ark of the Covenant.'

35:31.853 --> 35:34.201
The Ark is protected
by a Shaolin monk.

35:34.235 --> 35:35.788
He's invincible.

35:35.823 --> 35:39.309
Psychobook programmed him
with Force 7.

35:40.828 --> 35:44.349
Let my kung fu
masters handle this.

35:44.383 --> 35:47.938
They will get
the Ark of the Covenant for us.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.321
'Round one!'

36:50.035 --> 36:52.244
'You lose!'

36:53.521 --> 36:57.318
'Upgrade the kung fu masters
to Force 8.'

36:57.353 --> 36:59.734
'Upgrade complete.'

37:07.363 --> 37:09.641
'Round two.'

38:01.624 --> 38:03.660
'You win!

38:05.731 --> 38:08.493
'The Arc is yours!'

38:20.505 --> 38:24.888
"Davvero. Grazie, grazie."

38:26.027 --> 38:30.031
'"Davvero. Grazie, grazie."'

38:32.758 --> 38:37.660
Now that we have the old relic,
let's get the key.

38:50.983 --> 38:52.813
Mr. President.

39:01.856 --> 39:04.894
Congratulations, Mr. President.

39:07.034 --> 39:09.554
This new agreement
with the Soviet Union

39:09.588 --> 39:11.141
will give us full access

39:11.176 --> 39:14.144
to all the profiles
and regions of Psychobook.

39:14.179 --> 39:16.146
We will be able to protect

39:16.181 --> 39:18.494
our dear citizens
against bad guys.

39:33.025 --> 39:35.165
- Sir.
- Get out!

39:35.200 --> 39:38.410
Sir, can I borrow
your dwarf tomorrow?

39:40.481 --> 39:43.104
Of course not.

39:43.139 --> 39:45.866
Sir, I can make him
give us the code.

39:46.901 --> 39:48.834
Are you deaf or something?

39:48.869 --> 39:52.217
You don't trust me,
Mr. President?

39:52.251 --> 39:55.185
Do you take me for a fool?

39:56.980 --> 39:58.223
I'm sorry, baby.

39:58.257 --> 40:00.639
I'm just talking to this...
he's a jackass.

40:02.572 --> 40:04.712
So why don't we
collaborate together?

40:04.747 --> 40:07.025
I don't trust
this clown in the hat.

40:07.059 --> 40:09.855
Batfro, you will soon
rule over Psychobook,

40:09.890 --> 40:14.032
let Mr. Sophistication
do his job.

40:14.066 --> 40:19.106
OK. Comrade Stalin, I will do it
as a personal favor to you.

40:32.913 --> 40:39.160
Agent, tomorrow you will obey
Mr. Sophistication's orders.

40:40.817 --> 40:44.580
And I will send you home
so you can get your revenge.

40:44.614 --> 40:46.651
What revenge?

40:48.687 --> 40:50.965
Do you want to see the truth?

40:51.000 --> 40:52.829
This is the truth!

40:57.178 --> 40:59.111
Harder! Come inside me.

40:59.146 --> 41:01.666
I'm trying to come.
Yes, yes, yes!

41:01.700 --> 41:05.497
I'm so wet. You're so big!

41:05.532 --> 41:09.259
It's so big!
It's tearing me apart.

41:09.294 --> 41:10.951
What the fuck is that?

41:10.985 --> 41:16.750
Obey our instructions
and get your revenge.

41:16.784 --> 41:19.235
You can't trick me
with your lies!

41:19.269 --> 41:22.514
Your game is over, Stalin.

41:22.549 --> 41:24.689
You hear me?
Your game is over.

41:24.723 --> 41:26.898
The game is over.

41:38.944 --> 41:42.085
Don't cry, my little Prince.
You must be strong.

41:42.120 --> 41:46.055
Be strong.
You must be strong, my Prince.

41:46.089 --> 41:48.160
Don't cry.

41:48.195 --> 41:51.992
Come on, my little Prince,
don't cry.

41:52.026 --> 41:54.857
Be strong, my little Prince.

42:02.623 --> 42:04.556
Wait a second.

42:04.591 --> 42:06.178
Wait a second!

42:06.213 --> 42:08.146
Wait a second!

42:08.180 --> 42:11.045
Now I can see my dream.

42:11.080 --> 42:14.014
I'm already feeling much better.

42:14.048 --> 42:16.326
I'm the Emperor
of Betta Ethiopia

42:16.361 --> 42:19.122
so I can do whatever I want.

42:19.157 --> 42:21.677
Anything in the world!

42:21.711 --> 42:23.817
Everything in the world!

42:23.851 --> 42:29.270
And I can open a pizzeria,
it's my pizzeria!

42:29.305 --> 42:34.862
And I will do it with Malin,
my beloved Malin.

42:34.897 --> 42:36.830
She's so beautiful.

42:36.864 --> 42:38.935
She's like poetry,

42:38.970 --> 42:42.629
like the cool breeze
on a summer's day.

42:42.663 --> 42:46.253
My love... my everything.

43:58.118 --> 43:59.913
Stop sodomizing me, Agent,

43:59.947 --> 44:01.708
and try to find a way
to wake up!

44:06.298 --> 44:08.162
There is something wrong
with the mission,

44:08.197 --> 44:10.751
- I need to find the substance.
- What for?

44:10.786 --> 44:13.340
It's the only way back to Malin.
Do you understand?

44:13.374 --> 44:16.239
Forget that woman.
You are the savior.

44:16.274 --> 44:18.725
She is just a temptation
of the devil.

44:18.759 --> 44:23.039
How do I know you're not a
figment of my imagination, huh?

44:23.074 --> 44:25.939
You belong here,
you're the savior.

44:25.973 --> 44:28.355
You're not real,
you're part of my imagination.

44:28.389 --> 44:31.496
- This is a shame, Messiah!
-  You understand?

44:31.530 --> 44:34.188
Messiah, this is a shame.

44:34.223 --> 44:39.055
Yeah... shit.

44:49.894 --> 44:51.447
You're our only hope.

44:51.481 --> 44:54.243
You were sent to us
to liberate our land,

44:54.277 --> 44:56.038
to rid us of the fascists.

45:30.141 --> 45:33.006
Take the dwarf
to Mr. Sophistication.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.077
And no tricks!

46:02.380 --> 46:05.832
Please, Agent,
accept my apologies.

46:05.866 --> 46:09.249
I don't wanna create
any problems with the CIA.

46:14.081 --> 46:17.326
What do you want?

46:17.360 --> 46:25.437
I want... your coding signature
in order to access Psychobook.

46:25.472 --> 46:29.131
The Ark of the Covenant.

46:29.165 --> 46:33.825
The original and most powerful
Psychobook terminal.

46:38.347 --> 46:40.004
Holy ghost!

46:40.038 --> 46:43.179
You just want to go back home

46:43.214 --> 46:48.875
and I want to rewrite my role
in Betta Ethiopia.

46:48.909 --> 46:53.017
You just need to insert
your coding signature

46:53.051 --> 46:56.227
and Spaghetti will do the rest.

47:03.924 --> 47:08.101
'Welcome to Psychobook,
Agent D. T. Gagano.'

47:26.671 --> 47:29.432
Commandant, come see this.

47:32.677 --> 47:36.232
The virus is hacking
the whole system.

47:36.267 --> 47:39.063
Agent Gagano has activated
the tracking system

47:39.097 --> 47:42.238
with his coding signature.

47:42.273 --> 47:46.173
Put the satellite in position
and let's get rid of the virus.

47:52.421 --> 47:55.320
Satellite
over Betta Ethiopia.

47:58.461 --> 48:00.291
Sir, Psychobook detected

48:00.325 --> 48:03.052
the coding signature
of Agent Gagano.

48:03.087 --> 48:06.607
I'm asking for permission
to destroy Betta Ethiopia.

48:10.232 --> 48:13.097
Agent Gagano, sir.
Our field agent.

48:13.131 --> 48:15.030
He's still alive inside.

48:17.239 --> 48:20.380
'Mr. President, are you there?

48:20.414 --> 48:22.278
'The whole system
is under attack!'

48:22.313 --> 48:25.143
Commandant Rebane,
we can't annihilate

48:25.178 --> 48:27.939
a whole region
just to kill a virus.

48:27.974 --> 48:30.562
Sir, we can easily
rebuild the region,

48:30.597 --> 48:32.461
'it won't take us
more than two days.'

48:32.495 --> 48:34.463
I understand your point,
Commandant,

48:34.497 --> 48:38.570
but my order
is to abort the mission.

48:38.605 --> 48:40.676
Understood, sir.

48:40.710 --> 48:42.954
'What about our annual meeting?'

48:45.474 --> 48:52.584
Of course
I will attend

48:52.619 --> 48:57.106
the golf championship.

49:14.468 --> 49:17.264
We have full access
to all profiles and regions.

49:17.299 --> 49:20.578
Excellent.
Kill Mr. Sophistication.

49:22.166 --> 49:25.307
Now, I will put an end

49:25.341 --> 49:29.794
to the reign of this arrogant
motherfucker, Mr. Batfro.

49:29.828 --> 49:31.623
Don't you see, my friends?

49:31.658 --> 49:37.664
Betta Ethiopia belongs to me,
Mr. Sophistication.

49:37.698 --> 49:40.356
"Italiano."

49:43.601 --> 49:45.568
What the hell is that?

50:08.833 --> 50:12.319
The lord is my shepherd.
I shall have faith in him.

50:12.354 --> 50:16.806
Hey you!
Agent D. T. Gagano, CIA!

50:16.841 --> 50:19.257
You better surrender,
understand?

50:20.569 --> 50:22.329
Shit!

50:33.547 --> 50:35.170
Agent!

50:40.106 --> 50:44.179
Whoa! Thank God, Palmer.
Get me out of here.

50:44.213 --> 50:46.181
That's not possible,
kid.

50:46.215 --> 50:47.665
You're in an irreversible coma
out there.

50:47.699 --> 50:52.152
- You're not here to rescue me?
- Run! To the cabins.

50:59.884 --> 51:02.749
They shut down the mission.
It's all over.

51:04.716 --> 51:07.202
We had the opportunity
to kill Stalin,

51:07.236 --> 51:08.651
what's wrong out there?

51:08.686 --> 51:10.584
Run, kid!

52:03.430 --> 52:05.570
Now that you're safe,
I need to go.

52:05.605 --> 52:07.745
Why did you come then?

52:07.779 --> 52:09.402
I'm on
a covert mission,

52:09.436 --> 52:10.920
it's above your clearance.

52:10.955 --> 52:13.785
I wish I could get you
out of here, but I can't.

52:14.993 --> 52:17.203
Wake me up outside.

52:19.860 --> 52:23.692
You're braindead, friend.
Try to understand.

52:25.590 --> 52:27.765
I should go.

52:39.777 --> 52:42.297
I... I'm suffocating! Help!

52:42.331 --> 52:44.333
I'm suffocating! Please!

52:45.507 --> 52:48.544
Please, I'm suffocating.
Please!

52:49.476 --> 52:50.926
Oh, baby!

52:51.789 --> 52:54.688
Oh, man, what a headache!

52:55.862 --> 52:57.795
Oh, baby!

52:57.829 --> 52:59.797
Wait... where the hell am I?

53:02.696 --> 53:05.837
CIA Agent Gagano.

53:05.872 --> 53:08.288
I'm Roy Mascarone.

53:08.323 --> 53:11.912
Er... nice to meet you.

53:11.947 --> 53:13.880
Roy Mascarone.

53:13.914 --> 53:15.778
You know, until
a few minutes ago

53:15.813 --> 53:17.953
I thought I was Jesus Christ.

53:17.987 --> 53:20.921
You know Jesus, Jesus Christ?

53:20.956 --> 53:24.615
But then I saw your face.

53:24.649 --> 53:25.788
My face?

53:25.823 --> 53:27.756
I'm sure I know you
from another place

53:27.790 --> 53:29.482
and I'm sure
I can help you.

53:29.516 --> 53:30.897
To go home?

53:30.931 --> 53:35.729
Yes, and to know the truth
about this mission, Agent.

53:37.421 --> 53:41.045
I hope my story can help you
understand yours, Agent Gagano.

53:41.079 --> 53:43.668
It all starts when I wake up,

53:43.703 --> 53:47.258
I'm on top of a mountain
and I'm kind of sleepy.

53:47.293 --> 53:49.053
I don't remember anything
about my past

53:49.087 --> 53:51.055
or who the hell I am, OK?

53:51.089 --> 53:53.264
But then... listen, here comes

53:53.299 --> 53:55.680
the most interesting part
of the story.

53:55.715 --> 53:59.960
I start opening my eyes and
I think, "What is this place?

53:59.995 --> 54:02.929
"I should get out of here
as soon possible."

54:02.963 --> 54:04.724
This is what comes
to my mind, OK?

54:04.758 --> 54:06.588
Just move, get out of here.

54:06.622 --> 54:11.040
Then, I realize that something
like a voice inside of me

54:11.075 --> 54:14.906
is telling me
that I am Jesus Christ.

54:16.391 --> 54:18.496
I start walking, around me
there's only desert

54:18.531 --> 54:19.980
as far as the eye can see.

54:20.015 --> 54:22.638
And then, suddenly... I realize
I can perform miracles!

54:22.673 --> 54:25.814
So I'm a hero
and I can do tricks.

54:25.848 --> 54:28.920
All these powers made me very
unbelievable as a human being.

54:28.955 --> 54:31.475
And then hey,
who is this guy again?

54:31.509 --> 54:35.030
He's always at the beach.
His name is Palmer Eldritch.

54:35.064 --> 54:36.859
I feel terrible, I'm dating
the wife of my colleague.

54:36.894 --> 54:40.380
He says he's dating
his colleague's wife.

54:40.415 --> 54:41.761
He also tells me

54:41.795 --> 54:44.902
he's trafficking this thing
called the substance.

54:44.936 --> 54:47.801
Palmer talks wonderful things
about the substance.

54:47.836 --> 54:49.562
I follow him
into his secret den.

54:49.596 --> 54:51.080
Man, I really wanna explore

54:51.115 --> 54:53.531
the effects
of this mysterious substance.

54:53.566 --> 54:57.052
And explore parallel dimensions,
multiethnic people.

54:57.086 --> 54:58.985
Man, I start viewing
the substance

54:59.019 --> 55:01.125
in my memorable hallucinations.

55:01.159 --> 55:02.713
The people are waiting for me,

55:02.747 --> 55:04.749
for the substance
of Reverend Roy.

55:04.784 --> 55:07.890
The one that makes them explore
a new fascinating universe.

55:07.925 --> 55:10.479
But fuck! I got caught
by this strange masked guy.

55:10.514 --> 55:12.481
Run, run! Escape from him!

55:12.516 --> 55:14.863
Get to a place
where he will never catch you.

55:14.897 --> 55:17.693
He recodified me into one
of these disgusting flies

55:17.728 --> 55:18.867
and sent me to a place

55:18.901 --> 55:19.833
where I would never be
a threat again.

55:19.868 --> 55:20.938
Siberia?

55:20.972 --> 55:21.973
No, the Pagagayo resort,
man.

55:22.008 --> 55:23.147
The luxurious conditions
of the Papagayo resort

55:23.181 --> 55:24.666
made me forget
about everything!

55:24.700 --> 55:26.909
Then, I woke up in this yard

55:26.944 --> 55:30.775
and I saw your face
and I remembered the truth.

55:30.810 --> 55:35.021
I am Roy Mascarone,
not Jesus.

55:35.055 --> 55:39.715
How did my face
make you remember?

55:39.750 --> 55:45.169
Because, you gave me the keys
to my Mercedes-Benz, Agent.

55:45.203 --> 55:48.586
But I've never
seen you before.

55:48.621 --> 55:50.554
Let me explain it
to you, man.

55:50.588 --> 55:56.767
In 1997, Alan Foreman performed
a series of experiments at MIT.

55:56.801 --> 55:59.563
They were successful
in creating a network

55:59.597 --> 56:01.910
of makeshift data collections.

56:01.944 --> 56:04.464
The most comprehensive analysis

56:04.499 --> 56:06.984
of human behavior
ever conducted.

56:07.018 --> 56:10.850
A brain mapping network
called Psychobook.

56:16.787 --> 56:19.997
Excuse me!
Are these your keys?

56:20.031 --> 56:24.864
Oh! Thanks, man.
I don't have pockets.

56:27.798 --> 56:32.147
You're the owner of the pizza
place by the beach, right?

56:34.770 --> 56:38.015
Yeah. I own it
with my girlfriend.

56:38.049 --> 56:43.538
Roy Mascarone.
Are you here for the experiment?

56:43.572 --> 56:46.161
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

56:46.195 --> 56:49.889
The reality, man, is that
you and I are right now

56:49.923 --> 56:52.547
in the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology

56:52.581 --> 56:55.584
and the year is 1997.

56:55.619 --> 56:58.484
Massachusetts?
What the hell is that?

56:58.518 --> 57:00.106
The truth.

57:00.140 --> 57:03.765
The place where you will wake up
after three centuries

57:03.799 --> 57:06.561
or within the next hour
or in two days.

57:11.531 --> 57:14.707
You don't work
for the CIA, Agent.

57:14.741 --> 57:16.536
It's just a hallucination.

57:17.537 --> 57:18.987
What?

57:20.851 --> 57:24.268
God. Don't you see, Agent?

57:24.302 --> 57:26.926
Operation Jungle, the CIA,

57:26.960 --> 57:30.654
all of this
is just a virtual projection.

57:32.863 --> 57:36.073
- We are in 1997.
- What?

57:36.107 --> 57:37.902
They're playing with us.

57:37.937 --> 57:41.181
To collect our reactions
to different situations.

57:42.631 --> 57:45.807
You! You cheap copy of Jesus!

57:45.841 --> 57:48.050
Let me go! Let me go!

58:00.684 --> 58:03.756
You are charged with genocide
and crimes against humanity.

58:03.790 --> 58:06.655
You will never catch me alive.

58:06.690 --> 58:10.072
Shit! The substance
is in the candy.

58:10.107 --> 58:11.729
Fuck!

58:13.662 --> 58:17.183
I'm going to lock you up for
the next three thousand years!

58:17.217 --> 58:20.013
There is no escape!

58:20.048 --> 58:24.190
The lord is my shepherd.
I shall have faith in him.

58:24.224 --> 58:26.088
What are you doing?
Come on, stand up!

58:26.123 --> 58:27.780
Let's fight. Come on, guys.

58:27.814 --> 58:30.714
Let's fight. Stand up!
Come on, stand up.

58:30.748 --> 58:33.199
Let's fight together.
Come on!

58:33.233 --> 58:37.686
Come on. Come on!
Come on!

58:37.721 --> 58:42.277
Wait a second, your praying
is cracking the system.

58:42.311 --> 58:44.900
-  It's working!
-  Do you see?

58:44.935 --> 58:48.179
You have cracked
the speed of Psychobook!

58:49.871 --> 58:54.289
Here you go.
Go back to your reality.

58:57.016 --> 58:58.914
You belong to that world.

59:14.896 --> 59:16.932
You must go now.

59:18.037 --> 59:20.591
I'm sorry for failing you.

59:21.178 --> 59:23.629
Bye, my Emperor.

59:34.087 --> 59:36.607
Agent Gagano's mirror copy
has vanished.

59:36.642 --> 59:39.679
Eliminate this avatar as well.

59:46.444 --> 59:49.931
Sir, Commandant Rebane
is online.

59:56.938 --> 1:00:01.667
Commandant, prepare the corpse
of Agent Gagano for disposal.

1:00:01.701 --> 1:00:03.634
'He's still alive, sir.'

1:00:03.669 --> 1:00:05.878
You must put an end
to his suffering.

1:00:15.266 --> 1:00:17.303
I can't do that.

1:00:19.098 --> 1:00:20.720
Proceed.

1:00:28.763 --> 1:00:30.212
Salute!

1:01:15.948 --> 1:01:18.019
You must increase your sales,
Lieutenant.

1:01:18.053 --> 1:01:20.055
Stalin is not happy with you.

1:01:26.027 --> 1:01:28.926
Increase my sales? Fuck you!

1:01:28.961 --> 1:01:30.272
Huh?

1:01:43.285 --> 1:01:45.356
It's him.

1:01:45.391 --> 1:01:48.877
It's all I could save.

1:02:36.442 --> 1:02:41.827
'Birdie! Birdie, I'm back!
I'm back!

1:02:41.861 --> 1:02:45.416
- 'What day is it?'
- Saturday.

1:02:45.451 --> 1:02:48.868
'We're not late.
We're still on time.'

1:02:51.975 --> 1:02:55.219
Do you still want to come
with me, little fly?

1:02:55.254 --> 1:03:00.121
'Of course.
I have a vision, my love.

1:03:00.155 --> 1:03:02.192
'A new place by the sea.'

1:03:05.471 --> 1:03:08.854
So, let me go to the gym
and pack my stuff.

1:03:08.888 --> 1:03:10.476
'Malin, I know
you'll get angry at me

1:03:10.510 --> 1:03:12.167
'but I have to complete
this mission.

1:03:12.202 --> 1:03:17.863
'It's my duty and... Palmer
is dealing the substance.'

1:03:21.004 --> 1:03:24.386
Who cares?
We're finally together, right?

1:03:30.910 --> 1:03:33.016
'Aren't you happy to see me?'

1:04:02.390 --> 1:04:04.599
- Who's this?
- 'It's me, Agent Gagano.'

1:04:04.633 --> 1:04:06.221
Impossible, you're dead.

1:04:06.256 --> 1:04:09.190
'I'm not dead, sir, I'm trapped
inside a portable TV.'

1:04:09.224 --> 1:04:11.986
Stay there.
I will pick you up.

1:04:23.031 --> 1:04:24.930
'I'm here, Commandant.'

1:04:42.223 --> 1:04:45.571
Operation Jungle
is something very big, Agent.

1:04:45.605 --> 1:04:48.160
Bigger than you ever imagined.

1:04:53.682 --> 1:04:57.031
Shit, Palmer!
He was just there!

1:04:57.065 --> 1:05:00.172
Oh, no!
The CIA has taken him.

1:05:07.420 --> 1:05:11.631
Sorry for this, Agent,
we can't trust you anymore.

1:05:19.191 --> 1:05:21.020
'No!'

1:05:29.615 --> 1:05:32.100
Captain Lagucci.

1:05:49.290 --> 1:05:52.983
Lagucci! You motherfucker!

1:06:04.477 --> 1:06:07.377
The Soviet virus
is not our enemy anymore.

1:06:09.068 --> 1:06:11.381
- Stalin went missing.
- 'What happened to him?'

1:06:13.486 --> 1:06:18.560
Well, we believe
that the Russians

1:06:18.595 --> 1:06:23.669
destroyed the virus themselves
after losing control of it.

1:06:25.395 --> 1:06:27.397
Let's go home.

1:06:32.126 --> 1:06:34.645
The substance is our real enemy,

1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:40.479
it's using us and the Russians
to colonize planet Earth.

1:06:40.513 --> 1:06:44.448
It's using all of us
to spread and reproduce.

1:06:44.483 --> 1:06:48.521
Oh, come on, guy,
I will take you home.

1:06:49.557 --> 1:06:51.179
'A ticking bomb

1:06:51.214 --> 1:06:53.837
'means trouble
for Batman and Robin.'

1:06:53.871 --> 1:06:55.804
'Holy breaking
and entering, it's Batgirl!'

1:06:55.839 --> 1:06:58.255
'Quick, Batgirl, untie us
before it's too late.'

1:06:58.290 --> 1:07:00.775
'It's already
too late.'

1:07:00.809 --> 1:07:03.364
Are you sure
you're gonna be OK here?

1:07:03.398 --> 1:07:07.747
- 'I am, Captain.'
- OK. "Ciao, ciao."

1:07:07.782 --> 1:07:09.508
'Same job,
same employer

1:07:09.542 --> 1:07:11.717
'means equal pay
for men and women.'

1:07:11.751 --> 1:07:13.408
'No time for jokes, Batgirl.'

1:07:13.443 --> 1:07:16.135
'It's no joke.
It's the Federal Equal Pay law.'

1:07:16.170 --> 1:07:17.585
'Holy act of Congress.'

1:07:17.619 --> 1:07:19.345
'If you're not getting
equal pay,

1:07:19.380 --> 1:07:20.864
'contact the Wage
and Hour Division,

1:07:20.898 --> 1:07:22.486
'U. S. Department of Labor.'

1:07:23.453 --> 1:07:25.524
We must go, baby.

1:07:25.558 --> 1:07:28.389
I made a good sale
at the carnival.

1:07:28.423 --> 1:07:30.701
I'm not going anywhere
without him.

1:07:30.736 --> 1:07:36.431
By now, he's probably
been turned into junk.

1:07:40.780 --> 1:07:43.128
At least we made
some fresh money,

1:07:43.162 --> 1:07:46.890
we must leave now
or the CIA will catch us.

1:07:46.924 --> 1:07:48.202
I love you.

1:07:58.522 --> 1:08:00.145
I love you.

1:08:01.215 --> 1:08:03.251
Fuck you, asshole.

1:08:23.789 --> 1:08:25.411
'Traitor!'

1:08:25.446 --> 1:08:28.380
Fuck!
What the hell is that?

1:08:30.382 --> 1:08:32.418
Get out! Get out!

1:08:35.525 --> 1:08:37.147
Fuck.

1:08:44.499 --> 1:08:47.813
Look, I bought you
some new batteries.

1:08:50.540 --> 1:08:53.370
Listen, I wanted to tell you.

1:08:54.613 --> 1:08:58.375
We're going to Mallorca
with Palmer.

1:08:58.410 --> 1:09:00.688
- 'We?'
- The three of us.

1:09:00.722 --> 1:09:03.760
We will open
the kickboxing academy.

1:09:06.211 --> 1:09:11.457
'He stole our dream.
It was the two of us. Not him.'

1:09:11.975 --> 1:09:13.701
You were dead.

1:09:13.735 --> 1:09:15.841
'I was doing my job.

1:09:15.875 --> 1:09:23.711
'In the nights,
I dreamt of our pizzeria,

1:09:23.745 --> 1:09:27.784
'a beautiful restaurant
by the sea.'

1:09:34.308 --> 1:09:36.793
You never told me
about your pizzeria.

1:09:36.827 --> 1:09:39.451
'It really doesn't matter now.'

1:09:40.417 --> 1:09:41.832
Palmer saved you.

1:09:41.867 --> 1:09:43.420
He transferred
your consciousness

1:09:43.455 --> 1:09:46.768
to this radio-cassette
before the Commandant...

1:09:46.803 --> 1:09:49.875
'Shut up!
Palmer is dealing the substance.

1:09:55.398 --> 1:09:58.228
'We were going
to have children.'

1:09:58.263 --> 1:10:02.439
How? For God's sake,
you are a portable TV.

1:10:02.474 --> 1:10:04.648
Don't you see?

1:10:07.755 --> 1:10:10.689
Come with us to Mallorca,
little fly.

1:10:10.723 --> 1:10:12.898
'It was the two of us.

1:10:14.727 --> 1:10:16.971
'Turn me towards the window,
please.

1:10:27.499 --> 1:10:29.742
'How is this possible?'

1:10:36.439 --> 1:10:39.338
I can't leave you here,
don't you see?

1:10:41.098 --> 1:10:43.308
'You must leave, Malin.'

1:11:56.760 --> 1:11:58.693
You know, Johnny,

1:11:58.728 --> 1:12:04.734
the entire universe
is like a viscoelastic mattress.

1:12:04.768 --> 1:12:09.808
In a few seconds,
the mattress regains its shape

1:12:09.842 --> 1:12:13.812
and the imprint
of the body vanishes.

1:12:28.896 --> 1:12:33.487
Hey, for the glory of our lord,
the Reverend Roy!

1:12:33.521 --> 1:12:36.524
'Thank God. Have mercy.

1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:40.114
'Take me to the truth.

1:12:40.148 --> 1:12:42.012
'It's my last chance.'

1:12:42.047 --> 1:12:44.498
Don't worry, my friend.

1:12:44.532 --> 1:12:46.396
The Reverend Roy,

1:12:46.431 --> 1:12:50.089
who is the reincarnation
of Jesus Christ,

1:12:50.124 --> 1:12:51.746
will take you with him.

1:12:54.542 --> 1:12:57.580
Hurry up!
We don't have much time.

1:13:03.171 --> 1:13:05.622
Where shall we
find the truth?

1:13:05.657 --> 1:13:07.797
Body of Jesus Christ.

1:13:07.831 --> 1:13:12.180
- It's not the human body.
- No, not the human body.

1:13:12.215 --> 1:13:14.597
No, it's not the human body.

1:13:14.631 --> 1:13:17.151
He comes from the kingdom
of vegetables.

1:13:17.185 --> 1:13:20.430
No, it's not the human body.

1:13:20.465 --> 1:13:23.606
He comes from the kingdom
of vegetables.

1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:28.749
The oppressed ones, the slaves
are free in the kingdom of God.

1:13:28.783 --> 1:13:31.890
Far beyond the stars.

1:13:33.616 --> 1:13:35.652
In 1997.

1:13:36.170 --> 1:13:37.999
The cops!

1:13:44.627 --> 1:13:46.870
Bastards!

1:13:46.905 --> 1:13:48.458
Here!

1:13:49.252 --> 1:13:50.805
Here!

1:13:52.082 --> 1:13:53.739
The kid!

1:13:53.774 --> 1:13:57.467
- Come on, give it to the kid!
- No, I don't want it.

1:13:57.502 --> 1:13:59.227
Give it to the kid.

1:14:00.297 --> 1:14:02.817
Here, Reverend!
Here, Reverend!

1:14:02.852 --> 1:14:05.268
Here, Reverend!
Here! Here!

1:14:07.512 --> 1:14:09.652
Gagano!
What are you doing here?

1:14:09.686 --> 1:14:11.136
'There's no time to lose, Roy.

1:14:14.691 --> 1:14:16.175
'What's all this charade about?'

1:14:16.210 --> 1:14:17.694
I synthesized the doses

1:14:17.729 --> 1:14:20.904
that will finally
get us out of here.

1:14:24.598 --> 1:14:25.978
See you in MIT.

1:14:31.294 --> 1:14:36.748
Go back to life...
together with the truth.

1:14:36.782 --> 1:14:40.165
She's a bee that gets lost
with the changing wind,

1:14:40.199 --> 1:14:41.718
she's a fish.

1:14:50.106 --> 1:14:52.177
The Reverend escaped again.

1:14:52.211 --> 1:14:54.075
Shit! He was faster once again.

1:14:54.110 --> 1:14:55.939
Mr. President!

1:14:58.770 --> 1:15:02.187
- Burn down the place.
- There might be survivors, sir.

1:15:02.221 --> 1:15:05.017
Come see this, Mr. President.

1:15:05.052 --> 1:15:08.676
Do as I say. Burn it all down,
that's an order!

1:15:09.746 --> 1:15:11.127
Oh, no!

1:15:11.955 --> 1:15:13.509
Jesus Christ.

1:15:26.936 --> 1:15:29.317
What the hell is this?

1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:36.532
Sir, they were packaging
the substance in fish cans.

1:15:40.812 --> 1:15:42.296
Those bastards! How?

1:15:42.330 --> 1:15:43.677
They've been using
a ghost company

1:15:43.711 --> 1:15:45.851
from Long Beach California, sir.

1:15:45.886 --> 1:15:48.371
Sir, you're not
gonna believe this.

1:15:48.405 --> 1:15:52.686
Reverend Roy was Chico Panero!

1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:56.241
What?
Who the hell is Chico Panero?

1:15:57.242 --> 1:15:59.278
We don't know, sir.

1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:03.179
Damn. Shit!

1:16:03.213 --> 1:16:05.077
Chico Panero!

1:16:05.112 --> 1:16:08.391
Bring me all the information
on Chico Panero!

1:16:08.425 --> 1:16:11.636
Find all the intel
and bring it to me!

1:16:31.897 --> 1:16:34.382
I've been awake
for more than twenty minutes.

1:16:34.417 --> 1:16:38.214
- Who is Roy Mascarone? You?
- No, that would be me!

1:16:38.248 --> 1:16:41.286
Here he is.
Let me just...

1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:43.391
- OK, your check.
- Oh, thank you.

1:16:43.426 --> 1:16:44.979
There you go.

1:16:45.014 --> 1:16:47.188
- Thank you. Bye!
- Thank you. Bye.

1:16:49.397 --> 1:16:51.054
Commandant.

1:16:51.089 --> 1:16:54.989
I'm still at your service.
Operation Jungle.

1:16:55.024 --> 1:16:57.371
You're still confused, sir.

1:16:57.405 --> 1:17:01.755
It's me. Agent D. T. Gagano.

1:17:01.789 --> 1:17:05.413
You have shown some paranoid
symptoms during the experiment.

1:17:05.448 --> 1:17:09.935
If you experience symptoms,
please contact us.

1:17:09.970 --> 1:17:13.698
It's very important that you
contact us. Understand?

1:17:16.459 --> 1:17:18.806
Here is your check.

1:17:18.841 --> 1:17:21.153
Thanks for participating.

1:17:32.095 --> 1:17:34.857
- Hey!

1:17:40.034 --> 1:17:41.415
Excuse me, Roy.

1:17:41.449 --> 1:17:44.107
Do you know
how to get to the highway?

1:17:44.142 --> 1:17:48.974
Yeah, man, I'm heading that way.
Just follow me!

1:17:56.913 --> 1:17:59.467
Sweetie, come on! We're late.

1:17:59.502 --> 1:18:01.746
The pizzeria
should be open by now.

1:18:01.780 --> 1:18:02.954
I got the money.

1:18:02.988 --> 1:18:05.197
Now we can open
the kickboxing academy!
