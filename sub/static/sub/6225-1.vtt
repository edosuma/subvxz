NARRATOR:
In a land of myth and a time of magic,

00:05.173 --> 00:09.844
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.428 --> 00:12.930
His name, Merlin.

Merlin.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.292
Merlin!

01:25.086 --> 01:26.254
Yes, sire?

01:26.337 --> 01:27.380
Are you deaf?

01:29.048 --> 01:30.091
| wish.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.469
| want you to go down there
and tell them to stop.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.429
But they're working under
the King's orders.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.849
Yeah. And you're working under mine.

02:54.717 --> 02:56.010
Hello.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.139
How do you think he died?

03:43.557 --> 03:44.725
Gaius?

03:44.809 --> 03:45.935
Hmm.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.812
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

03:50.940 --> 03:53.234
Do you know whose tomb it is?

03:53.401 --> 03:54.902
I'm not sure.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.406
Do you think it might be cursed?

04:12.002 --> 04:13.504
You've just saved my life.

04:14.964 --> 04:16.673
-UTHER: Get out of my way.
-Thank you.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.843
UTHER: Make sure the entrance
is guarded at all times.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.681
Idiot.

04:25.141 --> 04:27.143
Were you born clumsy
or do you work at it?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.353
It's just one of my many gifts.

04:30.020 --> 04:33.691
Well, this is quite a find.
You see, Gaius. I was right.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.861
There is treasure to be found
under Camelot.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.116
Which of my predecessors
do I have to thank for all this?

04:44.452 --> 04:47.163
-Gaius”?
-I would have to look into it, sire.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.461
UTHER: How did he die?

04:53.544 --> 04:56.589
He seems to have unwittingly
triggered a trap. Here.

04:56.881 --> 04:58.090
To deter grave robbers.

04:58.174 --> 05:00.676
There's plenty in here
people would want to steal.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.972
Have them secure the tomb. Guarding it
is your responsibility, Arthur.

05:05.723 --> 05:06.974
Yes, father.

05:14.273 --> 05:17.943
So this jewel...
What size would you say it was?

05:19.195 --> 05:20.279
About that size.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.948
My word. Really?
About that size, you say.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.409
Here you are, drink up.

05:26.452 --> 05:27.995
And this tomb...

05:28.954 --> 05:31.373
| bet they've got that locked up,
nice and safe, haven't they?

05:31.457 --> 05:33.626
-Tighter than the King's coffers.
-Yeah.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.794
There must be a way in though?

05:36.629 --> 05:38.005
Only with the keys.

05:38.589 --> 05:42.009
Right, right, right.
And who's got the keys?

05:44.094 --> 05:47.765
You must think I'm stupid.
I'm not telling you that.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.517
Course not.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.229
A bright lad like you knows what that
sort of information is worth.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.024
We don't want everyone to see.

05:57.942 --> 06:01.028
Believe me, this place is full
of thieves and fingersmiths.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.905
Put it inside your tunic.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.575
And careful of that fellow over there.

06:07.368 --> 06:08.744
Which one?

06:09.370 --> 06:13.290
Far end of the bar, do you see him?
He keeps on watching you.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.709
Yeah, yeah, yeah, with the beard.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.837
No, that one.

06:22.258 --> 06:24.468
| got my eye on him.

06:25.094 --> 06:26.178
Thank you.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.806
So who's got the keys?

06:31.642 --> 06:32.851
Only the prince.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.438
But don't get your hopes up.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.482
He keeps them
in his private chambers.

06:38.983 --> 06:43.696
And there's only one person
allowed in there, his servant.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.365
-ARTHUR: Hurry up, Merlin.
-Sorry.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.085
(GRUNTING)

07:02.840 --> 07:04.216
Merlin!

07:04.883 --> 07:07.553
-I don't understand.
-Well there's a surprise.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.681
- I did that girth up myself.
-That might have been the problem.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.683
It wasn't my fault!

07:12.766 --> 07:15.519
Would you like me to fit the girth
properly for you, sire?

07:17.688 --> 07:19.064
Thank you.

07:19.148 --> 07:21.525
It is an honor to be of service
to the Prince.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.321
An honor. Do you hear that, Merlin?

07:25.404 --> 07:28.449
Allow me the honor
of brushing your clothes down?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.622
(MOUTHING)
"The honor."

07:35.039 --> 07:37.041
Anything else I can do for you, sire?

07:37.875 --> 07:40.419
You can give Merlin here
a kick up the backside.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.212
(CHUCKLING)

07:42.296 --> 07:44.673
| wouldn't wish to deprive you
of the pleasure, sir.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.635
What's your name?

07:47.926 --> 07:49.094
Cedric.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.180
I've come to Camelot in search of work.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.682
Good, you can be a beater on the hunt,

07:53.766 --> 07:55.434
we're short of a man or two.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.728
You are too kind, sire.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.399
Here, you'll need a beater.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.151
Oh, sorry.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.372
You just saved my life!

10:23.248 --> 10:25.626
Honestly, sire, it was nothing.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.838
| shall be forever indebted to you.
You must be rewarded.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.423
No. I couldn't possibly...

10:32.549 --> 10:34.885
Come on! What do you wish for?

10:35.719 --> 10:38.222
-I desire only one thing, sire.
-Anything.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.433
-A position in the Royal Household.
-Good.

10:42.726 --> 10:43.894
Consider it done.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.024
You can have that back now.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.943
Oh, sorry.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.383
What's wrong?

11:14.466 --> 11:17.886
| saved Arthur's life,
someone else got the credit.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.681
Just the usual. What're you doing?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.685
| found this inscription on the scepter.

11:27.312 --> 11:30.107
-What language is that?
- I don't know.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.901
Sigan would have known
many languages.

11:32.985 --> 11:35.028
-Sigan?
-It's his tomb.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.531
Who was he?

11:37.823 --> 11:41.952
Merlin, he was the most powerful
sorcerer to have lived.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.955
-Really?
-You didn't grow up in Camelot.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.040
But for those of us that did,

11:47.124 --> 11:50.711
Cornelius Sigan
was a figure of nightmare.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.671
Why?

11:53.714 --> 11:55.465
Sigan's powers.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.761
He could change day into night,
turn the tides.

11:59.845 --> 12:04.725
And, legend has it,
his spells helped build Camelot itself.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.186
What happened?

12:08.312 --> 12:09.688
In the end he grew too powerful

12:09.813 --> 12:12.190
and the King at that time
ordered his execution.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.404
If he's dead, why are you so worried?

12:18.989 --> 12:20.157
Sigan couldn't bear the thought

12:20.240 --> 12:22.242
that his wealth and power
would die with him

12:22.326 --> 12:24.953
sO he became obsessed

12:25.037 --> 12:27.414
with finding a way
to defeat death itself.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.042
And do you think
he might have succeeded?

12:32.169 --> 12:35.172
Let's hope not, for all our sakes.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.431
Gaius. What is it you want?

12:45.515 --> 12:48.268
To seal up the burial chamber
and all its contents.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.604
Don't be ridiculous.

12:50.687 --> 12:54.942
The insignia on this ring
belongs to Cornelius Sigan.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.528
| believe it to be his tomb.

12:59.738 --> 13:03.033
In the old religion the name Sigan
means "Raven."

13:03.867 --> 13:05.243
No wonder the riches are so great.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.371
Then you are aware of the legend?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.081
Yes.

13:09.206 --> 13:12.125
I've always enjoyed the tale of
the arrogant sorcerer

13:12.209 --> 13:13.961
who came to an untimely end.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.881
According to the story,
Sigan cursed Camelot.

13:17.965 --> 13:21.051
He said he would one day return
and raze the city to the ground.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.305
Gaius, you've always my ally
in the war against sorcery.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.474
You, more than anyone,
should not give in

13:27.557 --> 13:29.893
to these irrational fears.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.438
Thank you, sire.

13:34.272 --> 13:38.402
And Gaius, do not spread panic
amongst my people.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.447
This is foolish superstition,
nothing more.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.313
GWEN: It's alright.
It's alright. I'm here.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.190
There's nothing to be frightened of.

-ARTHUR: Is that lunch?
-No, it's breakfast...

14:34.458 --> 14:36.293
This is lovely, Cedric.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.298
Is there anything else
that you need doing, sire?

14:42.340 --> 14:43.967
No, I think Cedric's got it all covered.

14:46.136 --> 14:50.515
Oh! I regret, sire, there is
one thing I've failed to do.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.684
Muck out your horses.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.689
Off you go.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.403
I'll get the door for you.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.552
-What was this dream about?
-A bird.

15:30.222 --> 15:33.016
-What kind of bird?
-A raven.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.601
A raven?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.354
It was terrifying, Gaius.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.190
What do you think it means?

15:41.566 --> 15:43.110
Probably nothing.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.654
It's happening again, isn't it?

15:45.737 --> 15:50.575
Morgana, one raven doesn't mean
that your nightmares are returning.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.373
Are you taking the sleeping
draughts I prepared for you?

15:58.291 --> 16:01.086
I'll get Gwen to give you
something stronger.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.130
Like a blow to the head?

16:05.257 --> 16:06.883
I'm sure she wants to.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.907
(HORSES NEIGHING)

(SNORING)

17:15.242 --> 17:17.621
-Sire!
-What are you doing?

17:20.290 --> 17:21.499
Nothing.

17:21.625 --> 17:22.791
| can see that.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.171
| wasn't sleeping.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.506
| was...

17:30.967 --> 17:32.302
| was just bending down.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.012
Looking for something?

17:34.638 --> 17:35.764
Yes.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.724
Perhaps we're looking
for the same thing.

17:37.807 --> 17:41.311
-What?
-I don't know...the horses?

17:41.686 --> 17:44.814
The horses? Oh!

One mistake I can understand,
everyone has a bad day now and then,

17:47.943 --> 17:50.445

| don't know what happened.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.367
Sire...

17:56.618 --> 17:58.161
Please, sire. Don't be too hard on him.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.747
He's a good servant, he's just tired.

18:00.830 --> 18:01.957
| am not!

18:02.040 --> 18:05.168
Maybe if he had the evening off.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.420
-I don't want the evening off.
-A good night's rest...

18:07.504 --> 18:09.005
| did not fall asleep!

18:09.214 --> 18:12.008
| am more than willing to
take over his duties tonight.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.010
-Perhaps you're right. Shut up, Merlin.
-No!

18:14.135 --> 18:16.554
Can't you see what he's trying to do?
He's trying to get rid of me!

18:16.680 --> 18:19.015
If you weren't such
a clotpole you'd see that.

18:19.182 --> 18:20.392
A what?

18:22.519 --> 18:24.813
Clotpole. He said clotpole.

18:29.651 --> 18:32.487
Cedric's right.
He can look after me tonight.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.532
You can go home

18:35.657 --> 18:37.826
and think about whether you
want to be my servant or not.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.536

-Go!

-Nothing.

19:24.748 --> 19:26.249
Here.

19:32.255 --> 19:33.590
| am not an idiot.

19:34.257 --> 19:35.592
What happened?

| just want Arthur to trust me

19:40.889 --> 19:42.432

who I really am.

41:06.590 --> 41:07.966
Merlin?

41:40.040 --> 41:41.917
Well done, my boy.

42:00.977 --> 42:03.063
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

42:05.357 --> 42:09.027
We must learn our lesson
from these terrible events, Gaius.

42:09.528 --> 42:12.864
-Indeed, sire.
-They prove that I was right.

42:14.700 --> 42:18.745
Magic is evil,
it is our greatest threat.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.085
| have grown complacent, Gaius.

42:27.421 --> 42:29.089
| wouldn't say that, sire.

42:29.464 --> 42:31.299
We must renew our efforts.

42:32.008 --> 42:35.929
We must ensure that all sorcerers
and their followers

42:36.012 --> 42:38.557
are eradicated from this Kingdom.

42:40.934 --> 42:43.228
Of course, sire.

42:49.359 --> 42:51.820
You know you won't
get any thanks, Merlin.

42:51.903 --> 42:52.988
I'm not a complete idiot.

42:55.031 --> 42:57.951
There you go, it's not much,
but you deserve something.

42:58.577 --> 42:59.745
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

43:01.705 --> 43:03.123
I've come to see Merlin.

43:06.042 --> 43:09.504
I've not forgotten about your lazy,
insolent ways.

43:09.588 --> 43:12.799
Or the fact that
you called me a clotpole.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.344
But I do have to admit
that there was some truth

43:16.428 --> 43:18.305
in your accusations against Cedric.

43:20.307 --> 43:22.267
Does this mean you're admitting

43:22.350 --> 43:24.352
that on this occasion
| was actually right?

43:27.397 --> 43:29.191
Not exactly, no.

43:29.274 --> 43:32.736
It means that I have a knighthood
to bestow first thing tomorrow

43:33.653 --> 43:36.114
and no one to clean my armor.

43:36.573 --> 43:38.116
(METAL CLANGING)

43:41.870 --> 43:42.996
All that?

43:43.622 --> 43:44.706
Yep.

43:54.090 --> 43:55.425
Clotpole!

44:05.811 --> 44:08.063
ARTHUR:
What would you know about magic, Merlin?

44:08.146 --> 44:09.272
Nothing.

44:09.356 --> 44:12.651
Today you will fight for glory
and for honor.

44:12.734 --> 44:14.694
That has got to hurt.

44:16.321 --> 44:18.365
ARTHUR:
Nothing could ever happen between us.

44:18.448 --> 44:20.575
When you're king you can change that.

44:20.700 --> 44:23.870
You do realize your wife is a troll.

44:23.954 --> 44:25.163
What?

44:25.247 --> 44:27.749
-(FLATULENCE)
-How could he resist such beauty?

44:28.834 --> 44:30.961
UTHER;:
Send for the witch finder.

44:31.044 --> 44:33.797
Your magic is a secret
to be guarded with your life.

44:35.924 --> 44:38.009
| won't sacrifice a friend
to save myself.

44:38.093 --> 44:40.053
Gaius is already doomed.

44:41.596 --> 44:42.806
My name is Lancelot.

44:45.517 --> 44:46.643
Merlin?

44:49.396 --> 44:52.148
Do not believe that you can lie to me.

44:54.359 --> 44:55.652
They're going to kill each other.

45:07.080 --> 45:08.373
The boy, Merlin.
