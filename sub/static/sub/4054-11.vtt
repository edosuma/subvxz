NARRATOR:
Four weeks ago,

00:03.295 --> 00:06.332
an invisible dome crashed down
on Chester’s Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.413
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.962
The dome has tested our limits,

00:11.178 --> 00:14.090
forcing each of us to confront
our own personal demons:

00:14.848 --> 00:15.883
Rage.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.674
Grief.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.642
- Fear.
- My God.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.397
Now in order to survive,
we must battle

00:25.609 --> 00:27.520
our most dangerous adversary:

00:28.028 --> 00:30.110
the enemy within.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.692
Inside Eva is the queen

00:32.908 --> 00:34.944
who will lead our Kinship
out of the dome.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.696
- Push now.
- No!

00:48.465 --> 00:50.751
We need to split the amethyst
into seven pieces.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.753
If the cure works and Joe figures out
how to take down the dome,

00:55.973 --> 00:58.180
maybe we can all get out of here
the same way we came in.

for the town?

Junior was doing well.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.056
He was back to his old self.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.935
So if Hektor's cure works,
it can help your baby.

13:04.826 --> 13:08.284
I can't be responsible
for whether 2,000 people live or die.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.699
Anyone would be oven/vhelmed
thinking that.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.748
Think of it as saving your girlfriend.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.666
Who you vowed to kill.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.627
We're way past that now.

13:17.839 --> 13:21.172
Our priority, like yours,
is to get out of here alive.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.464
Can we focus on that?

13:22.677 --> 13:26.169
Only if you promise me that Norrie will
be safe when the dome comes down.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.552
You have my word.
I won't harm Norrie.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.846
Close your eyes.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.512

13:35.940 --> 13:39.478

They always have.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.767
I'm so sorry.

14:15.980 --> 14:20.349
I can't imagine how hard this must be,
seeing someone you loved like this.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.978
I didn't love her.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.147
I never even knew her.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.150
Not the real her.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.195
What do you think happened?

14:34.624 --> 14:37.081
That nursing session
was like nothing I've ever seen.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.659

That's hemorrhaging.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.609
She was suffocated.

15:06.531 --> 15:07.566
Who would do this?

15:08.783 --> 15:10.648
It doesn't make any sense.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.154
Why kill Eva?
A newborn needs its mother.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.613
So Christine said
that everybody serves a purpose.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.534
Eva's was to carry the new queen.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.540
What if once she gave birth,
they didn't need her anymore?

15:24.173 --> 15:26.255
I'm not gonna let Christine
use my daughter

15:26.467 --> 15:27.627
the same way she used me.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.709
I'm gonna find her
and I'm gonna kill her.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.299

preschoolers cross the street.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.725
Are they always this synchronized?

three times in the past 20 minutes.

Nothing's happening there. Figure out
where these zombies are going.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.567
Maybe they'll lead us to Christine.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.365

NORRIE: Something's on the dome.

15:53.536 --> 15:54.946

Slow and easy.

are already in panic mode.

to our brains.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.076
The Kinship won't survive until
the dome comes down. Not like this.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.368
What if we eliminate competition
for air?

16:43.920 --> 16:46.832
Reducing the drain
on our oxygen supply

16:47.048 --> 16:51.007
ensures that the young and healthy
survive to propagate outside the dome.

16:51.761 --> 16:56.004
I have one final task to ask of you
before my cycle ends.

16:56.224 --> 17:00.137
It might even inform who
the new queen chooses as her alpha.

17:00.311 --> 17:03.394
- Anything, Christine.
- Whatever the Kinship needs.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.139
Take the elderly to the lake.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.065

Someone could see you.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.624
You knew I'd come back for you.

on the window.

before the air supply is cutoff.

17:44.647 --> 17:45.682

from the radio station?

17:53.864 --> 17:56.947
I can use it
to amplify the tones for the device.

It was the last missing piece,
but if it works, then--

17:59.745 --> 18:02.236

outside the dome tomorrow night.

- No, you're not waiting anywhere.

without you.

- Sacrificing the elderly wasn't enough.

are worsening.
