WEBVTT

00:11.044 --> 00:14.309
Hilda, I'm so sorry, but it has to
be my last shampoo. I've got to go!

00:14.347 --> 00:18.147
Betty, take it easy! I like it rough,
but only on the weekends.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.175
If you know what I mean.

00:22.255 --> 00:23.381
Ow!

00:23.423 --> 00:26.722
Sorry, Sammy. But I've got to get going.
I'm just anxious about getting to work.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.091
Aunt Betty, don't worry about it.

00:28.128 --> 00:31.461
I'll just stay home from school
and help out.

00:31.498 --> 00:33.432
I'm not double-booking haircuts
to make money

00:33.466 --> 00:35.991
to get you into private school
just so you can get rejected

00:36.036 --> 00:37.901
'cause you're too stupid
'cause you skipped public school.

00:37.937 --> 00:41.998
<i>Here we go, ladies. A little dulce
and cafecito on the house.</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:44.442
Hey, Sammy.
Betty tell you about the big promotion?

00:44.477 --> 00:45.808
No, what big promotion?

00:45.845 --> 00:49.337
<i>Yeah, well, I got promoted to
associate features editor at Mode.</i>

00:49.382 --> 00:52.351
But don't you worry,
I will be back to assistant in no time.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.080
<i>Mi hija, don't talk like that.</i>

00:54.120 --> 00:58.079
Sit up. Well, it's true.
My first issue as editor is going to print,

00:58.124 --> 01:00.319
and I am the only one
without anything in it.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.828
Plus, Matt is killing all of my pitches

01:02.862 --> 01:05.763
and basically making
my life impossible.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.996
- You know you're hurting me, right?
- Matt is a spoiled bitch.

01:09.035 --> 01:10.127
Mom!

01:10.170 --> 01:13.936
I'm sorry. I'm just saying, everybody's
all sweet when you're in love,

01:13.973 --> 01:15.531
but it's when something bad happens,

01:15.575 --> 01:17.600
that's when a person
shows their true colors.

01:17.644 --> 01:19.043
I don't know who he is anymore.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.774
Well, I don't know
if you guys know this,

01:20.814 --> 01:23.647
but currently, I'm working
in the fashion industry.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.583
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

01:25.618 --> 01:29.076
I'm doing the remodel on Evan Grant's
condo down in the West Village.

01:29.122 --> 01:31.784
Evan Grant?
The Dolce & Gabbana men's designer

01:31.825 --> 01:34.293
who breathed life
into the fur-trimmed hoodie?

01:34.327 --> 01:37.524
Must be. I heard him on the phone
saying he's leaving the Dolce

01:37.564 --> 01:39.532
and going to the Gucci.

01:40.900 --> 01:41.958
What?

01:42.001 --> 01:43.161
Now, it's supposed
to be a secret, all right?

01:43.203 --> 01:45.433
No one's supposed to know about that.

01:45.472 --> 01:48.134
Let's be honest, who the hell cares?

01:48.174 --> 01:52.770
Oh, Sammy, if I could get
the first published interview

01:52.812 --> 01:54.712
with the new creative director at Gucci,

01:54.747 --> 01:56.578
do you know what that would do
for me at work?

01:56.616 --> 01:58.550
Well, maybe Sammy can hook you up
with the guy

01:58.585 --> 01:59.711
and you can ask him all about it.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.549
- Whoa, whoa, Betty.
- Yes!

02:01.588 --> 02:06.525
Sammy promised to "hook me up"
with a salon chair two months ago.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.757
You see it here?

02:08.794 --> 02:12.128
Well, anything you could do, Sammy,
it would really help.

02:12.165 --> 02:14.565
There are a lot of people
lining up for my job.

02:14.601 --> 02:17.434
I don't want to make it any easier
for them. Thank you. Bye!

02:19.539 --> 02:21.473
Oh, my God,
Wilhelmina is going to freak!

02:21.508 --> 02:23.408
Claire and Papa Hartley
killed the Cotton Club shoot.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.239
Now Baby Hartley's calling
an emergency editors' meeting.

02:26.279 --> 02:27.303
Morning, guys!

02:27.347 --> 02:28.871
- Hey!
- Hate you!

02:28.915 --> 02:32.112
Oh, yay. I'm so glad that
I get to catch a rare glimpse

02:32.185 --> 02:36.087
of the last living Monchhichi waddling
into a meeting that I should be in!

02:36.122 --> 02:40.149
Wow! You're, like,
oozing self-pity today. Something's up.

02:40.193 --> 02:41.990
Oh, my God, happy birthday!

02:44.063 --> 02:48.625
We are not talking about that, got it?
One more mention and heads will roll.

02:48.668 --> 02:52.434
Pretty blonde heads
that don't have their original nose.

02:52.472 --> 02:53.666
Mean.

02:54.607 --> 02:57.804
Oh, oh, sorry, Betty. I always sit here.
Remember?

03:02.315 --> 03:03.714
Okay. Um...

03:04.017 --> 03:07.214
Matt, is there another chair?

03:07.253 --> 03:10.882
Oh, yeah, I asked for one for you.
Guess that's all they had.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.058
A beanbag?

03:15.000 --> 03:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.374 --> 03:30.342
- Ow!
You all right down there?

03:30.376 --> 03:32.071
Yep! I'm fine.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.637
How is Betty the editor
of a fashion magazine?

03:35.682 --> 03:38.810
That would be like me being the editor
of, like, a mechanics magazine.

03:38.851 --> 03:41.547
Or you being the editor of a magazine.

03:41.588 --> 03:45.957
Ooh, pick up your face.
Wait, you just totally slammed me.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.926
At least you were
considered for the job.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.452
Nobody around here
even takes me seriously.

03:50.496 --> 03:52.555
Damn it,
you just made me think about my life.

03:52.599 --> 03:53.930
With the Cotton Club
shoot dead,

03:53.967 --> 03:56.527
that means that there is an opening
in this issue, so I'm gonna need...

03:56.569 --> 03:59.936
Wait, I'm sorry.
Did you say an opening in this issue?

03:59.973 --> 04:03.033
Yes, that's what I said.
I will be taking pitches all day.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.941
So I need good ideas,
but think cheap, okay?

04:04.978 --> 04:09.540
The budget is only going to be about...
Uh, Betty, can you not text right now?

04:09.582 --> 04:12.016
Yeah, no, I'm sorry,
it's business-related.

04:12.051 --> 04:14.349
See, I was shampooing
this guy's hair this morning

04:14.387 --> 04:16.355
and he said
he might have a story for us.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.481
Oh.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.887
It wasn't, like, a creepy shampoo.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.226
My sister has a hair salon, and it was
just busy, so she needed my help.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.595
I'm her sister,
what am I gonna say, no?

04:25.632 --> 04:27.862
Okay, stop. We're uncomfortable.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.834
Okay, so come to me
whenever you have your pitches.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.734
All right? Let's go.

04:32.338 --> 04:33.600
Matt?

04:34.407 --> 04:35.567
Matt.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.075
- Matt!
- Yeah?

04:38.011 --> 04:41.538
I think I might have a pitch.
Actually, a pretty good one.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.982
Nothing personal, but I can't take
"might" to Wilhelmina. Thank you.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.246
No, I know that. I know.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.311
But you know what?
The way you said that,

04:48.354 --> 04:51.619
that did feel a little personal,
and I would just appreciate it...

04:51.658 --> 04:53.683
- Okay, Betty, don't, please...
- That tone of...

04:55.528 --> 04:57.928
I am trying to keep my job here
just like you are.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.329
And I don't know if you realize this,

04:59.365 --> 05:02.425
but your UN fiasco
made us both look bad.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.732
So, which one of us is
making this personal?

05:10.043 --> 05:13.774
They are so in love it's disgusting.
I want that.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.373
Take it. I just want her job.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.350
Are we obsessed with Betty?

05:19.385 --> 05:21.945
Yes. And it's exhausting.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.455
I know, and I'm sorry.

05:23.489 --> 05:27.255
But that psychedelic misfit toy
is living my dream.

05:27.293 --> 05:30.023
Would I let someone
take my dream from me?

05:30.063 --> 05:33.499
Or would I find a way to take it back?

05:37.337 --> 05:40.431
I never think to destroy someone
for me.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.737
That's called low self-esteem.

05:44.110 --> 05:47.546
I can't believe this is still healing.
How hard did you hit him?

05:47.580 --> 05:51.209
It's like his stubble actually fought back.
Oh, no.

05:53.419 --> 05:55.387
I can see you, Daniel.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.015
I hate my new desk.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.924
Aren't you supposed to be
at a support group meeting right now?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.325
Daniel, is that true?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.956
I didn't want to go, all right?
Some sad bereavement group

06:04.997 --> 06:07.329
is not gonna help me
get over Molly's death.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.028
That's not what I need right now.

06:09.068 --> 06:12.697
What? Support? Guidance?

06:12.739 --> 06:16.402
Care? Shared experience?
Which of these is the problem, Daniel?

06:16.442 --> 06:19.707
Come on. You're kind of trapping me
with your words there.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.476
Daniel, this sort of thing
can't keep happening.

06:22.515 --> 06:25.484
As much as I would like for you
to punch Matt in the face again,

06:25.518 --> 06:28.078
right now, there is another meeting
this afternoon.

06:28.121 --> 06:31.522
If I find out that you're not there,
I'm gonna physically carry you myself.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.819
Got it?

06:37.430 --> 06:40.194
Betty, did you know that editors' calls
get transferred to assistants

06:40.233 --> 06:41.427
during editors' meetings?

06:41.467 --> 06:43.697
Yep. I used to get them
when I worked for Daniel.

06:43.736 --> 06:47.968
Ah, remember how irritating it is?
Please hold for your pretty sister.

06:48.007 --> 06:52.410
When you're done listening in
on Betty's phone call, I need my coffee.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.511
Hilda, did you get my text?

06:57.550 --> 07:00.417
Yeah, I got it.
I called Sammy and guess what?

07:00.453 --> 07:04.355
- The stupid goombah came through.
- No! He did?

07:04.424 --> 07:08.918
For you, a big meeting with
a fancy designer today at 4:00.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.724
For me? Nothing.

07:10.763 --> 07:14.062
Today? What? This is amazing!

07:14.100 --> 07:16.967
Hilda, if I can get this story,
I can get it in this issue!

07:17.003 --> 07:18.300
Ah!

07:18.638 --> 07:20.572
What was that?
Did you just burp at me?

07:20.606 --> 07:23.131
No, I don't know what that was.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.407
You know what you do, right?
You go into Matt's office

07:26.446 --> 07:28.573
and you rub this
in his spoiled rotten face.

07:28.614 --> 07:32.311
No way, Jose.
I am keeping this one to myself.

07:32.351 --> 07:34.979
If I want to keep my job,
I have to go around Matt.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.613
He's made that very clear.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.920
All right, I will text you the address.
I gotta go.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.825
Okay. Thank you, thank you,
thank you, Hilda! I love you!

07:41.861 --> 07:42.953
It's about time!

07:42.995 --> 07:45.520
I'm trying to find somebody to cover
a busboy shift at the restaurant.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.658
- Let me do it.
- What?

07:48.701 --> 07:49.861
- Yeah.
- No.

07:49.902 --> 07:52.769
- Why?
- I said "busboy," not "bus you. "

07:52.805 --> 07:54.602
<i>Papi, wait!</i>

07:54.640 --> 07:57.268
I really need the money to get Justin
out of that awful school.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.837
I promise you I will do such a good job.
Ridiculous.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.882
- Okay. For Justin.
- Yeah.

08:04.917 --> 08:08.148
Now get over there early
so they can train you.

08:08.187 --> 08:12.487
<i>Please, papi, I think I know
how to take dirty plates off of a table.</i>

08:16.295 --> 08:19.822
Mizrahi's TV show?
Cindy Crawford's skin care line?

08:19.866 --> 08:21.766
Have I stepped into a time warp?

08:21.801 --> 08:23.234
- Is this the '90s?
- Well, actually, you know,

08:23.269 --> 08:24.293
those things are happening right now...

08:24.337 --> 08:28.330
Don't give me these tired pitches
to replace my canceled photo shoot.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.342
Now I know
fashion's not really your thing,

08:30.376 --> 08:32.537
but you can at least try to fake it better.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.179
We're done, get out.

08:39.885 --> 08:44.118
Oh, please, tell me some
good news. I'm not enjoying my day.

08:44.155 --> 08:47.819
<i>You are now.
I found Connor.</i>

08:47.860 --> 08:50.021
<i>Feel like a trip to Bermuda?</i>

08:52.932 --> 08:55.662
You're going down there now?
Well, what are you gonna do,

08:55.701 --> 08:56.759
march up to him and say,

08:56.802 --> 09:00.704
<i>"Hey, Conn, remember that money
you stole from Mode? Hand it over"?</i>

09:00.740 --> 09:03.300
No, Marc, I'm gonna make him an offer.

09:03.342 --> 09:07.108
He can either come back to the US
with my armed bounty hunter

09:07.146 --> 09:10.081
and stand trial for his crimes,

09:10.116 --> 09:12.311
or he can give me
what's left of the money

09:12.351 --> 09:15.320
and I can buy out
Hartley and the Meades and...

09:15.354 --> 09:16.514
You know the drill.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.855
They're clearly trying to push me out
of this company.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.258
I can see it in their old, droopy eyes.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.092
Are you gonna be
able to do this?

09:24.130 --> 09:25.927
I mean, you did have feelings
for that man.

09:25.965 --> 09:30.231
Whatever feelings I had, Marc,
won't get in the way. I am no amateur.

09:33.172 --> 09:36.073
- Where's she off to? Club a seal?
- Whatever, she's gone.

09:36.108 --> 09:38.633
Gives me time to deal with Suarez.

09:38.678 --> 09:42.114
<i>Apparently, she's got some huge story
that's gonna save her ass at Mode.</i>

09:42.148 --> 09:45.015
She has a meeting
with a mysterious "he" at 4:00.

09:45.051 --> 09:46.416
Ooh, what's the story?

09:46.452 --> 09:47.976
Doesn't matter.
I'm not gonna let her get it.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.080
And if young Betty doesn't get
something in soon,

09:51.123 --> 09:52.681
her job is as good as mine.

09:52.725 --> 09:54.989
"Young Betty"? You mean
because you're older than her?

09:55.027 --> 09:57.655
Okay, why don't you just kick me?
Kick me in the special parts.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.131
No more birthday. Got it? None!

10:02.568 --> 10:04.968
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

10:08.574 --> 10:11.975
Oh, my gosh.
How'd you know?

10:12.011 --> 10:14.946
I did office birthdays
the whole time I was an assistant.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.950
But now that that's your job,
I thought I would do one more

10:17.984 --> 10:21.283
because I knew you would
never get yourself a cake.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.050
You get me. You really get me.

10:24.090 --> 10:27.617
To be honest, I almost forgot
just because I had a terrible morning.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.150
But now I think
it's gonna be a great day.

10:29.195 --> 10:33.188
And I hope it's gonna be great
for you, too, Marc. Make a wish!

10:53.686 --> 10:55.620
Daniel, swear to me
that you're really there.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.419
I swear. How do you want me
to prove it to you? What...

10:59.992 --> 11:03.450
Excuse me, will you please tell
my friend where I am right now?

11:04.664 --> 11:05.995
Please?

11:06.032 --> 11:08.796
A crappy school. Support group.

11:09.635 --> 11:12.069
This phone smells like cheese.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.474
See? I'm gonna go to the whole thing.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.670
It's gonna be
really good for you, Daniel.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.702
<i>I know it's gonna be good for me.</i>

11:20.880 --> 11:22.472
Goodbye, Betty.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.519
Oh, no, you don't. Get back here.

11:38.731 --> 11:43.134
- Oh. Hey, uh...
- You promised that person you'd stay.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.761
You had me vouch for you.

11:44.804 --> 11:48.672
Don't rope me in and then
make me seem like a liar. It's rude.

11:51.444 --> 11:52.775
Come on.

11:55.081 --> 11:57.413
I had no idea I was gonna
be meeting him in his home.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.884
I thought it was gonna be an address
for his office or something.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.443
Well, the only way
I could get him down here

12:01.487 --> 12:03.751
was I had to tell him
he had to pick a shower tile today

12:03.789 --> 12:06.087
or the project was gonna take
another two weeks.

12:06.125 --> 12:09.891
He's a little ticked off, but so what?

12:09.929 --> 12:10.953
The way you just said that,

12:10.996 --> 12:13.021
that sounds like he doesn't know
he's gonna meet me.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.532
He doesn't.

12:14.967 --> 12:18.198
Okay, calm down.
You are a very impressive young lady.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.205
You just be you
and he's gonna love you.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.298
I have two minutes, Sammy. Two!

12:22.341 --> 12:25.174
I made a million decisions today.
I do not want to be doing this right now.

12:25.211 --> 12:27.736
Here, would you take this from me
before I throw it against the wall?

12:30.049 --> 12:31.311
That's it?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.720
Twelve shades of blue?
I cannot be doing this right now.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.053
Would somebody just decide?
Somebody just pick a tile for me.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.990
Someone? Anyone?

12:41.093 --> 12:42.993
Who the hell are you?

12:45.831 --> 12:46.923
Hi.

12:47.700 --> 12:51.693
<i>I'm Betty Suarez.
I work at Mode magazine.</i>

12:51.737 --> 12:53.261
<i>- Mode?
- Mode.</i>

12:53.305 --> 12:55.500
I'm a features editor there,

12:56.208 --> 12:59.644
and I was wondering if you would
let me do a story on your transition

12:59.678 --> 13:01.805
from Dolce & Gabbana to Gucci.

13:01.847 --> 13:05.078
Whoa! No, wait.
How do you know about that?

13:05.117 --> 13:07.347
Are people talking about that?
Is it out there? It can't be!

13:07.386 --> 13:11.152
No, no, no. No one knows.
Just me. Just me.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.420
What... I don't...
What are you even doing here?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.498
Don't look at me like that.
She's a good kid, all right?

13:22.535 --> 13:25.129
She's a friend from the neighborhood.
She's just trying to save her job.

13:25.171 --> 13:27.833
Oh, really?
And how are you gonna save your job?

13:27.873 --> 13:33.038
No, Mr. Grant, please don't fire Sammy.
He was just trying to help me.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.773
In a really weird way.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.079
I'm gonna leave you my card
and you can call me. If you want.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.677
I hope you will. Either way, it's fine.

13:40.719 --> 13:44.177
I promise I will not tell anyone
about your story.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.288
I can't even pick a tile.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.294
How am I supposed
to decide in three seconds

13:49.328 --> 13:51.387
if I should give my story
to an 11-year-old editor

13:51.430 --> 13:53.091
who broke into my house?

13:53.132 --> 13:56.295
Well, I would just put them all up.
I like all of the blues together.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.665
Really?

14:01.073 --> 14:04.804
- Why do I like that?
- Well, because I just stole your idea.

14:04.977 --> 14:07.207
You know, that's what you do
when you show your suits

14:07.246 --> 14:09.476
and you dress your models
in the same color shirt and tie.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.712
The blue on the blue, the gray on
the gray, just slightly different shades,

14:12.751 --> 14:14.946
which you said
in your 2008 fashion week interview

14:14.987 --> 14:20.323
was to bring attention to the suit
and not the tie and the shirt.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.687
All right, we'll have dinner tonight.
See if we're a good match.

14:25.731 --> 14:28.393
If we are, great. If not,
you do not break into my house again.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.368
- Got it?
- Yeah.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.199
Call my office. And Sammy?

14:34.506 --> 14:37.168
Put them all up! Blue on blue!

14:37.209 --> 14:39.609
You got it! Huh?

14:47.653 --> 14:49.314
You couldn't take it, either?

14:51.056 --> 14:54.253
"Either"? You're the one
who made me go back in there.

14:54.293 --> 14:57.660
And I was right to.
Those meetings are very helpful.

14:57.830 --> 14:58.922
But?

14:59.431 --> 15:02.298
- But this one sucked so hard.
- Thank you!

15:02.334 --> 15:05.565
How about that chick who was wailing
about her 100-year-old grandmother

15:05.604 --> 15:09.233
that fell and broke her hip and got
pneumonia and died two days later?

15:09.275 --> 15:10.674
I know, two days at 100.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.540
It doesn't sound like
such a bad way to go.

15:12.578 --> 15:16.412
Right? I mean,
try losing somebody your own age.

15:18.284 --> 15:19.410
Yeah.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.179
You, too?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.900
These donuts are old as hell.

15:34.934 --> 15:39.667
What do you say I treat us to some
fresh ones? I feel like I owe you.

15:46.545 --> 15:47.910
- What's all this about?
- Oh!

15:49.348 --> 15:52.840
I'm trying to figure out
what Betty's big story is so I can kill it.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.443
But I don't know her password.

15:54.486 --> 15:55.885
- Try "burger. "
- I already did.

15:55.921 --> 15:59.152
And "cupcake" and "Menudo"
and "Daniel's lady. "

15:59.191 --> 16:00.658
What are you doing?

16:01.160 --> 16:02.320
Uh...

16:05.030 --> 16:09.194
I'm writing you a thank-you note.
Well, a thank you and an apology.

16:11.570 --> 16:14.232
Ever since you got this promotion,

16:14.273 --> 16:18.767
I have been letting my jealousies
get the better of me.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.742
So, can I start over?

16:22.781 --> 16:25.909
Can we go back to being

16:27.786 --> 16:29.651
whatever we were before?

16:29.688 --> 16:33.954
Well, to be honest,
that is why I got you the cake.

16:33.993 --> 16:38.726
I wanted you to know
that despite all of this, we're still,

16:40.733 --> 16:42.701
you know, whatever we were before.

16:44.703 --> 16:45.897
Yay.

16:46.438 --> 16:49.032
So, hey, how did that big meeting go?

16:49.074 --> 16:50.701
Oh! Lt, uh...

16:51.710 --> 16:53.143
It was fine.

16:54.680 --> 17:00.277
Scary at first, but you know, it just
turned into dinner at my dad's place.

17:00.319 --> 17:01.877
Nothing... Nothing big.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.114
Wow.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.782
Sounds exciting.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.118
Where does your dad work again?
Frankie's?

17:08.160 --> 17:10.720
You know, I have to get back
to doing some research.

17:10.762 --> 17:14.722
- Do you need anything else?
- Nope. That's it. Have fun.

17:24.009 --> 17:25.169
<i>Willie.</i>

17:25.210 --> 17:27.440
Can you believe there's traffic
in Bermuda?

17:27.479 --> 17:31.006
<i>Well, luckily I've chased felons here
before, so I know all the shortcuts.</i>

17:31.050 --> 17:32.574
Did you find Connor?

17:32.618 --> 17:35.610
We're outside his hotel
waiting for his return.

17:35.654 --> 17:38.851
Claire give you any trouble
about me being gone?

17:38.891 --> 17:42.486
No. But Betty, on the other hand,
is a headache that just won't quit!

17:42.528 --> 17:45.588
<i>She's got some big important dinner
tonight that, clearly, I have to ruin.</i>

17:45.631 --> 17:49.294
<i>But I don't want her to know
that it was me who ruined it.</i>

17:49.468 --> 17:52.335
<i>So, now I have to figure out
some way of getting Betty</i>

17:52.371 --> 17:55.863
to come undone at dinner
without me being there.

17:55.908 --> 18:00.868
Everyone has their Achilles' heel, and
no one's is more obvious than Betty's.

18:11.223 --> 18:16.024
Oh, my God, I think I just found
Betty's Achilles' sensible...

18:16.061 --> 18:17.619
<i>If you'd like to make a call, please...</i>

18:17.663 --> 18:18.857
Willie?

18:18.897 --> 18:21.559
I try to be a good friend,
but there is a limit.

18:25.237 --> 18:26.568
Wait, don't leave.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.732
What would you say
if I told you that I figured out

18:28.774 --> 18:31.641
a super fun way for you
to prove your worth around here?

18:31.677 --> 18:34.373
I would say it's nighttime.
Tell me tomorrow.

18:34.413 --> 18:38.406
Oh, wow, that doesn't sound like a
woman who wants to be taken seriously.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.418
That sounds like a girl
who wants to go out, get drunk,

18:40.452 --> 18:42.010
fall in bed with a man
who doesn't love her,

18:42.054 --> 18:45.285
come back here tomorrow and
answer phones for the next 20 years.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.588
Or at least until the hard living
catches up to her

18:47.626 --> 18:51.562
<i>and Mode wouldn't dare let that
grizzled face out from behind a cubicle!</i>

18:53.565 --> 18:55.795
- I'm listening.
- Wait here.

18:55.834 --> 18:59.998
- Matt! I just had the best idea!
- For the magazine?

19:00.038 --> 19:01.630
No. No, for you!

19:01.673 --> 19:04.608
Remember today when you brought
all those pitches to Willie

19:04.643 --> 19:06.634
and she shamed you in the worst way?

19:06.678 --> 19:08.270
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.440
Sorry. But come on,
can you blame her?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.746
You really don't know
anything about fashion,

19:12.784 --> 19:15.252
and as long as she thinks
that you're only here because...

19:15.287 --> 19:17.414
Well, that's not important.

19:17.456 --> 19:20.016
No, no, no, it sounds important.
Only thinks I'm here because...

19:20.058 --> 19:21.855
Because you want to be near Betty.

19:21.894 --> 19:25.295
But relax, she only thinks that
because everyone else does.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.558
Everyone else does?

19:26.598 --> 19:28.293
Matt. Matt. Matt. Matt.

19:30.135 --> 19:32.296
You haven't exactly been
soaking up information,

19:32.337 --> 19:35.898
trying to prove that you
actually belong here. Have you?

19:36.642 --> 19:39.475
No, I guess not. But it's not that easy.

19:40.312 --> 19:41.711
Or is it?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.446
It's free dinner at Frankie's
super-hot restaurant

19:45.484 --> 19:49.318
with a not-hideous billionaire
whose father owns half this company.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.345
A man who one day
may take over himself.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.358
All you have to do is teach him
a little bit about fashion,

19:53.392 --> 19:54.654
which nobody knows better than you,

19:54.693 --> 19:58.151
<i>and he'll totally see that you deserve
a brighter future here at Mode.</i>

19:58.197 --> 20:00.222
I don't see the downside.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.995
I hate his shoes.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.231
- Here, put these on.
- Why?

20:11.443 --> 20:13.638
Have fun!

20:28.126 --> 20:30.321
And that's what
I've been doing there...

20:30.362 --> 20:33.422
Here you go, Miss Suarez. Your usual.

20:33.465 --> 20:36.332
And for the gentleman,
vodka rocks, two limes.

20:36.368 --> 20:37.892
- Thank you.
- Sure.

20:37.936 --> 20:41.372
And how about a little starter
from the kitchen?

20:41.406 --> 20:45.638
One of Miss Suarez's favorites,
on the house.

20:45.677 --> 20:49.078
- Wow, they really treat you well here.
- Yes, they do.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.614
Because they are my family
and they are pretending.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.244
This is my sister, Hilda,
and my father, Ignacio.

20:54.286 --> 20:56.117
<i>- Hi! How you doing?
- Mucho gusto.</i>

20:56.154 --> 20:58.782
<i>También.</i>

21:01.526 --> 21:02.652
Okay.

21:02.928 --> 21:06.455
<i>Oh! Right, well, bon appétit.</i>

21:08.133 --> 21:12.126
Sorry about that.
They just want this to be special for me.

21:12.170 --> 21:15.401
- They're like that.
- Yeah, my family's the exact same way.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.307
- Oh, really?
- God, no. They're horrible people.

21:18.343 --> 21:21.506
- Would you guys consider adopting?
- Oh! Uh...

21:21.546 --> 21:22.808
For free clothes, yeah!

21:22.848 --> 21:25.646
My sister
and my nephew would love to...

21:35.661 --> 21:37.151
Hey, Betty.

21:53.245 --> 21:54.678
Oh!

21:57.082 --> 21:58.447
Oh, good. You turned so white

21:58.483 --> 22:00.576
I thought I would turn around
and see a gunman.

22:00.619 --> 22:05.181
- Or a Kardashian. Who is that?
- Nobody. They're nobody.

22:07.125 --> 22:13.963
Okay. That's my bosslex-boyfriend
and that's my friendlex-roommate.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.894
Oof! And they're on a date?

22:17.936 --> 22:21.133
No! A date?

22:21.173 --> 22:24.267
No, they're so not each other's type.

22:25.077 --> 22:28.843
I mean, he's rich,
so he's her type, but no.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.516
Do you want to
go somewhere else?

22:32.884 --> 22:34.977
No. No, why would we?

22:35.354 --> 22:39.757
Oh, okay. Maybe Betty's not on a date
five tables away.

22:40.325 --> 22:44.955
A date? Even if she were,
you know, we can stay.

22:45.430 --> 22:51.460
Okay. Order me a martini.
I'll be right back. I gotta whiz.

22:57.175 --> 22:59.439
Oh, I am so sorry. Two minutes.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.139
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hmm...

23:04.816 --> 23:07.751
Is that Matt with Amanda?
What are they doing here?

23:07.786 --> 23:09.981
Are they, like, on some kind of date
or something?

23:10.021 --> 23:11.147
No. I don't know.

23:11.189 --> 23:12.884
Why does everybody
keep saying "date"?

23:12.924 --> 23:14.585
Two people can have dinner.
It's called "friends. "

23:14.626 --> 23:16.594
So, what, they're friends now?

23:16.628 --> 23:18.721
Hilda, please,
don't make this a thing, okay?

23:18.764 --> 23:19.992
I can't think about that.

23:20.031 --> 23:21.658
I need to focus on
my meeting with Evan,

23:21.700 --> 23:24.396
which Matt can't even know about.
All right?

23:24.436 --> 23:27.599
- Promise.
- Of course. Are you...

23:27.639 --> 23:31.200
...seriously on a date with Amanda
in my father's restaurant

23:31.243 --> 23:32.904
with Betty sitting right over there?

23:32.944 --> 23:34.275
I don't think that's any of your business.

23:34.312 --> 23:37.839
Just like it's none of my business that
Betty is sitting 10 feet away from me

23:37.883 --> 23:39.680
with whoever that guy is.

23:39.718 --> 23:43.779
That sounds like you are on a date.
But you know what? That's cool.

23:43.822 --> 23:46.985
Because Betty's on a date, too.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.585
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:51.196 --> 23:54.495
Well, good. Good.
I guess we're even then.

23:54.533 --> 23:56.558
I completely understand,
but this is my point,

23:56.601 --> 24:01.334
if you release a statement to the press,
the excitement lasts, what, a day?

24:01.373 --> 24:03.898
<i>If you let me do a story at Mode,</i>

24:03.942 --> 24:05.933
then we can feature
any of your new designs,

24:05.977 --> 24:07.672
along with a huge announcement,

24:07.712 --> 24:12.240
and then it's a whole event,
not just a piece of news.

24:12.984 --> 24:14.576
No, it makes sense.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.645
Although, now I'll have
to finish those new designs.

24:17.689 --> 24:20.920
If they have designer block,
that's what I'm suffering from right now.

24:20.959 --> 24:24.258
I can't decide
whether I want a thin knot on my...

24:27.232 --> 24:31.328
I'm so sorry. One second, I promise.

24:31.369 --> 24:34.634
Don't worry, I told him you were
on a date, too. You're welcome.

24:34.673 --> 24:38.666
Hilda, you... Wait, what?
He said he was on a date?

24:38.710 --> 24:40.075
- Yes.
- No.

24:40.111 --> 24:43.080
- Yeah.
- Why would... He can't...

24:43.915 --> 24:45.007
No!

24:45.183 --> 24:48.744
Hilda, what are you doing to her?
You should be picking up plates!

24:48.787 --> 24:51.085
<i>Papi, I've got to tell her
what kind of guy Matt really is!</i>

24:52.257 --> 24:54.919
Please!
Listen, you know what you've got to do?

24:54.960 --> 24:58.259
You've got to go out there
and rub your date in his face,

24:58.296 --> 25:00.423
just like he's rubbing his in yours.

25:00.465 --> 25:01.523
No.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.897
No. I can't... I can't do that.
Evan's not even my date.

25:05.804 --> 25:10.036
I can't deal with this right now! I won't!
I can't! I have to focus on the meeting.

25:10.075 --> 25:13.169
This isn't happening!
This is not happening!

25:38.336 --> 25:40.361
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Here, let me help.

25:40.405 --> 25:41.963
No, no, I got it. I got it. Please. Just...

25:42.007 --> 25:44.168
- Ow! That's hot. Ow, ow!
- No, no, it's okay.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.370
- Sorry.
- Please just go back to your seat.

25:46.411 --> 25:47.708
Please.

25:48.446 --> 25:49.777
You okay?

25:50.348 --> 25:52.043
Are you all right, sir?

25:53.985 --> 25:55.179
I just...

25:55.220 --> 25:59.919
I can't stand the feeling
that I don't know what to do.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.483
What comes next. What's gonna help.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.461
You've just got to try
and find something that works for you.

26:06.164 --> 26:11.261
I try everything. As far as mourners go,
I think I fall on the needy side.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.663
Is anything working?

26:14.706 --> 26:18.699
Actually, there's this thing I heard
that really stuck with me.

26:19.544 --> 26:23.275
It's this idea that
when you lose someone,

26:23.315 --> 26:27.581
you should do one thing every day
that makes you feel totally alive.

26:27.919 --> 26:31.377
You know, because it feels
like there's so much death.

26:32.223 --> 26:36.182
I don't exactly know what would
make me feel like that right now.

26:36.227 --> 26:38.161
It's been a while.

26:38.997 --> 26:41.966
I hear you. Unfortunately for me,

26:42.000 --> 26:46.061
a lot of the things that used to
make me feel alive are illegal.

26:49.541 --> 26:52.669
Wait. What's that smile?

26:55.280 --> 26:58.545
When I was a kid, we used to spend
the summers in the Hamptons.

26:59.851 --> 27:02.115
My brother and I would stay up

27:03.188 --> 27:06.248
and we'd sneak into the neighbors'
yards and swim in their pools,

27:06.291 --> 27:08.452
which was kind of weird
because we had a pool.

27:08.493 --> 27:11.291
But it didn't matter,
because every time we did it,

27:11.329 --> 27:12.990
I always thought,

27:13.298 --> 27:17.632
"We are, for sure,
the coolest kids ever. "

27:19.871 --> 27:20.997
Huh.

27:23.008 --> 27:26.375
You know, I didn't do
my feel-alive thing for today.

27:33.618 --> 27:35.176
So is that a...

27:35.220 --> 27:37.051
Hey! Sorry to bother,

27:37.088 --> 27:40.524
but I've got to get a picture
of my little sister's first big meeting.

27:40.558 --> 27:43.254
Get over there. Squeeze together.
Squish together.

27:43.294 --> 27:45.228
I said we have to do
something soft and pretty and...

27:45.263 --> 27:47.823
Look at him.
Okay, close together. Squish, squish.

27:47.866 --> 27:48.958
Is this okay?
Yeah.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.661
Really see you. Yeah, get cozy.
Like you're friends.

27:50.702 --> 27:51.828
Hilda!

27:51.870 --> 27:53.098
Take the picture.

27:53.138 --> 27:56.335
Cool! That was great!
Thanks, saving it!

27:56.374 --> 27:58.934
So, do you want to talk about

27:58.977 --> 28:02.435
classic designers, current trends,
or the next big thing

28:02.480 --> 28:05.574
that only I and a few
Japanese schoolgirls know about?

28:05.617 --> 28:08.245
All of it. But you know, first,
you've got to try this salad.

28:08.286 --> 28:10.117
- It's amazing.
- Oh, no food. Just liquor.

28:10.155 --> 28:12.623
I save all my caloric intake for dessert.

28:12.657 --> 28:14.090
- Oh.
- Ow!

28:14.392 --> 28:17.384
- Ow! Ow! I got an eyelash in my...
- Here.

28:17.429 --> 28:20.330
It hurts! Get it out. Get it out. Get it out.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.799
Did you get it?
Get it, get it, get it. It hurts so much.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.233
Got it.

28:28.073 --> 28:30.041
You know what?
Why don't I come back over there

28:30.075 --> 28:34.034
<i>and show you some stuff that
I've had published at Mode and online?</i>

28:34.746 --> 28:39.115
Just side by side, if that's okay.
It makes it easier to...

28:39.684 --> 28:41.777
Just... It's easier to...

28:42.020 --> 28:43.988
Oh! This here is...

28:46.257 --> 28:47.451
Um...

28:48.893 --> 28:50.451
But here... Oh, there it is.

28:50.495 --> 28:53.362
If you want a tailor, go to
the random woman at the dry cleaner

28:53.398 --> 28:54.456
and you'll save a lot of money.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.691
Marc? This trip is a total disaster.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.226
Connor checked out this morning.

28:59.270 --> 29:03.138
And I suspect he was tipped off
by our bargain bounty hunter.

29:03.174 --> 29:07.110
We need a new bounty hunter.
Next time, I prefer one in brown.

29:07.979 --> 29:09.503
Hello, Willie.

29:11.549 --> 29:12.880
Connor!

29:18.156 --> 29:20.590
- Whoa!
- Give that back to me.

29:20.625 --> 29:21.819
I just want to catch up a bit

29:21.860 --> 29:24.693
before you call the goon
and start the blackmailing.

29:24.729 --> 29:28.358
- I've no idea what you're talking about.
- Don't pretend with me.

29:28.399 --> 29:31.266
I know every move you've made
since I left.

29:31.936 --> 29:36.168
You know, I may be a crook,
but my feelings for you were real.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.334
And I thought you felt
the same way about me.

29:38.376 --> 29:41.709
Any feelings I had for you
died the day you stole from me!

29:41.746 --> 29:44.715
How could you, Connor?
I put my life into that magazine!

29:44.749 --> 29:47.217
Everything I had! And you took it.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.544
You walked off
and you left me with nothing.

29:49.587 --> 29:54.524
I didn't really take from you.
I took for you! And I'd do it all again.

29:56.161 --> 29:59.528
- Come away with me.
- You are insane.

29:59.564 --> 30:01.862
Yeah, but I'm happy. Are you?

30:02.767 --> 30:06.498
Wilhelmina, you have always
lived your life a certain way.

30:06.671 --> 30:10.300
But when you're ready
to pursue another option with me,

30:10.341 --> 30:13.276
just put it out there, I'll find you again.

30:13.711 --> 30:16.179
But not until then.

30:19.017 --> 30:20.780
Ah, and one more thing.

30:54.919 --> 30:58.685
- Make it? I think we made it.
- I don't think anybody saw us.

31:00.458 --> 31:04.861
- Actually, we're not done yet.
- Go get the lights.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.171
Uh...

31:20.845 --> 31:23.211
Natalie, just so we're clear,

31:24.682 --> 31:27.048
I'm not really ready for...

31:28.953 --> 31:30.921
For what? Sex?

31:32.757 --> 31:35.191
My boyfriend OD'd two months ago,

31:35.894 --> 31:39.489
and I didn't have time to shower today,
so you're safe.

31:39.530 --> 31:40.588
- Oh, right.
- It's fine.

31:43.334 --> 31:46.826
- Oh, my God, it's cold.
- That's cold.

31:46.871 --> 31:49.271
- I can't believe we did this.
- Oh, my God.

31:54.879 --> 31:57.074
Okay, bye. That was Marc.

31:57.115 --> 31:59.879
I told him we're fine,
but Betty is a sloppy drunk

31:59.918 --> 32:01.442
and she's being all handsy
with some dude.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.750
He totally loves me right now.

32:08.626 --> 32:13.427
That was when I sprouted wings
and flew directly into the sun.

32:24.509 --> 32:25.908
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.913
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did that.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.710
Well, I do. You want to see
what's going on over there?

32:30.748 --> 32:32.181
- Go see what's going on back there.
- No, I don't.

32:32.216 --> 32:34.810
- This meeting's over. Good night.
- No.

32:35.253 --> 32:37.915
No! I'm... No! Please, I promise I...

32:42.460 --> 32:45.258
I don't know and I don't care what is
going on between the two of you,

32:45.296 --> 32:47.787
but what you did tonight
was unforgivable.

32:47.832 --> 32:50.858
- What did we do?
- Oh, that is so you, Amanda.

32:51.035 --> 32:54.198
Just playing innocent while you
throw yourself at the nearest billionaire.

32:54.238 --> 32:57.765
- Oh! Back that projector up!
- Yeah.

32:57.809 --> 33:00.801
Betty, I don't think that we were the
ones drawing attention to ourselves.

33:00.845 --> 33:03.279
- Oh, please, Matt, you were all over her!
- What, me? Me?

33:03.314 --> 33:07.375
- What about you and that guy?
- Whoa! Okay, stop!

33:08.386 --> 33:10.946
I just realized
what's been going on here.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.389
You know,
it is one thing to flirt with me.

33:13.424 --> 33:15.858
You're a man, I'm me, it happens.

33:15.893 --> 33:18.259
But to do it just to get back at Betty?

33:18.296 --> 33:22.232
Nobody uses this to make that jealous.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.495
I guess I was stupid

33:24.535 --> 33:28.335
to think that you actually wanted
to hear what I had to say.

33:29.273 --> 33:30.934
No, Amanda, I...

33:33.144 --> 33:34.236
You know,
just because your date was bad...

33:34.278 --> 33:35.506
- It wasn't a date.
... doesn't mean you have to...

33:35.546 --> 33:38.071
- Actually, it was really important!
- Hey! Hey! All right!

33:38.116 --> 33:40.243
Into the kitchen, here we go.

33:40.284 --> 33:44.721
That was a meeting!
A very important meeting!

33:44.889 --> 33:47.881
With a very important man who had
a great story for our magazine!

33:47.925 --> 33:49.415
Who you might have recognized

33:49.460 --> 33:52.486
<i>if you worked at Mode
for any other reason but to torture me!</i>

33:53.331 --> 33:56.164
Do you know how hard
I have worked for this promotion?

33:56.200 --> 33:59.499
How long I have waited?
And you are ruining it!

34:00.071 --> 34:03.438
You are ruining something
that means so much to me!

34:03.474 --> 34:06.409
I know! I know I am, and I can't help it!

34:08.279 --> 34:10.042
- What?
- You're right.

34:10.081 --> 34:14.016
I am awful to you,
but I can't stop myself

34:14.052 --> 34:17.783
because I can't stand seeing you happy
when I am in so much pain.

34:17.822 --> 34:20.120
And you probably
can't understand that

34:20.158 --> 34:23.559
because you are so good.

34:24.661 --> 34:26.721
You're not some spoiled rich kid
who can't handle it

34:26.764 --> 34:28.891
when he doesn't get his way,
but apparently

34:30.168 --> 34:31.897
that's who I am.

34:32.536 --> 34:34.902
And the worst thing is
that with every word I say,

34:34.938 --> 34:39.308
I know I am ruining whatever hope
we had of fixing this relationship.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.690
I don't know what just happened.

34:56.494 --> 34:58.394
He told you who he is.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.403
<i>It's from the bodega.</i>

35:10.441 --> 35:11.703
I remembered
you were waiting for dessert,

35:11.742 --> 35:13.767
but you left before you got it, so...

35:15.880 --> 35:17.643
Is that it?

35:17.682 --> 35:20.845
Look, I've been kind of a monster lately,

35:20.885 --> 35:22.750
and unfortunately,
you were one of the people I hurt.

35:22.787 --> 35:26.314
I mean, you were nice enough to share
your considerable wisdom with me,

35:26.357 --> 35:29.793
which I desperately need,
and I disrespected you.

35:31.262 --> 35:34.595
- My "considerable wisdom," huh?
- Yeah.

35:34.632 --> 35:37.157
- What? Too arch?
- No.

35:37.201 --> 35:39.692
Whatever.
I wish I knew half what you know.

35:39.737 --> 35:42.968
What I'm trying to say is I'm sorry.

35:44.075 --> 35:47.875
You're a smart, interesting woman,
and you should be treated like one.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.573
So I'll see you tomorrow.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.915
- Hey, Matt?
- Yeah?

36:07.732 --> 36:09.563
You know
what really makes me angry?

36:09.600 --> 36:11.465
I didn't even get to say goodbye to her.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.367
Who says you have to say goodbye?

36:13.404 --> 36:17.864
I mean, why do we have to give up on
relationships with people we've lost?

36:17.909 --> 36:21.367
Why can't we still have them,
but in a different way?

36:25.316 --> 36:27.409
Why don't you talk to her?

36:28.019 --> 36:31.716
Talk to Molly right now under the stars.

36:33.424 --> 36:38.088
No. Come on.
I'm not that guy. I don't... I don't do that.

36:38.129 --> 36:40.393
Don't be such a dude. Come on.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.426
- I can't do that.
- Oh, my God!

36:44.468 --> 36:47.301
Was he always this much of a wuss
when you knew him?

36:47.338 --> 36:49.135
Okay, all right.

36:51.742 --> 36:52.902
Um...

36:55.980 --> 36:57.345
Hi, Molly.

36:59.150 --> 37:02.085
I'm sorry I didn't get to say goodbye.

37:08.826 --> 37:11.727
I think I need to stop
being so angry now.

37:14.532 --> 37:16.625
I guess I was just afraid

37:19.303 --> 37:23.933
if I wasn't angry enough
you'd think, you know, I didn't care.

37:30.348 --> 37:35.217
I really need you to know that I...
I did care.

37:39.523 --> 37:40.888
So much.

37:44.128 --> 37:45.618
I still do.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.602
I bet she gets that.

37:59.243 --> 38:00.369
Yeah.

38:04.248 --> 38:06.239
It feels like she does.

38:10.588 --> 38:13.284
No, Amanda,
please don't close the door on me.

38:13.324 --> 38:15.315
Wow, a lot of traffic in here tonight.

38:15.359 --> 38:17.793
Amanda, I'm sorry.

38:19.163 --> 38:22.428
What I said was mean and unfair.

38:22.800 --> 38:23.960
Well, thank you.

38:24.001 --> 38:25.628
And just so you know,
I only went out with him

38:25.670 --> 38:28.070
because Marc said
Matt was insecure about work

38:28.105 --> 38:30.665
and it would be a really
good opportunity for me to step up...

38:30.708 --> 38:33.199
Wait. Wait, Marc set you up?

38:33.244 --> 38:34.541
Mmm-hmm.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.307
Did he tell you to go
to my father's restaurant?

38:37.348 --> 38:39.316
Yeah, he made the reservation.

38:40.785 --> 38:42.719
Oh, my God, that bitch!

38:43.454 --> 38:45.547
Yes, what you just said.

38:50.194 --> 38:54.187
Tonight after you left,
Matt sort of broke down

38:54.231 --> 38:58.668
and said all this stuff
about being a bad guy and...

38:59.570 --> 39:00.662
I don't know.

39:00.705 --> 39:05.074
For the first time in a long time,
I saw the good guy underneath.

39:05.109 --> 39:08.977
The guy I fell for.
The one who still cares about me.

39:09.013 --> 39:12.676
And now I'm stuck.
And I don't know what to do.

39:13.951 --> 39:15.851
Am I right about him?

39:16.721 --> 39:18.848
Or should I just move on?

39:27.164 --> 39:30.292
Honestly, Betty,
I think it's time you moved on.

39:41.412 --> 39:45.906
So, Associate Features Editor Suarez,
how'd the big dinner go?

39:45.950 --> 39:47.850
Bad. Actually, really bad.

39:47.885 --> 39:50.911
<i>And to make things worse, I just
found out Elle scored a great story</i>

39:50.955 --> 39:52.855
- that I worked very hard to get.
- Oh...

39:52.890 --> 39:55.256
But please don't pretend
to feel sorry for me, Marc.

39:55.292 --> 39:56.759
I know exactly what you did.

39:57.928 --> 40:00.795
And you know what?
We both deserved this job, but I got it.

40:00.831 --> 40:04.961
So deal with it and act your age.
Your new age.

40:14.044 --> 40:16.012
Oh, hey, Mandy.

40:16.847 --> 40:19.975
You don't use me
for your little schemes, okay?

40:20.751 --> 40:25.085
We use people together.
I'll text you when I'm over it.

40:30.861 --> 40:32.624
Hey. Welcome back.

40:34.465 --> 40:37.957
You okay about not finding Connor?

40:38.135 --> 40:42.970
Well, what could I do?
You win some, you lose some.

40:43.007 --> 40:45.567
Weirdly, I won mine,

40:46.610 --> 40:48.942
but nobody's talking to me now.

40:50.181 --> 40:54.675
Well, Marc,
scheming is a lonely business.

40:58.889 --> 41:03.053
- Are you smiling?
- Yeah, what's that smile about?

41:04.328 --> 41:08.059
I don't know, I guess I just kind of feel
a little more alive today.

41:08.098 --> 41:11.431
- Oh, Daniel, that's so nice to hear.
- That's great.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.801
And you? How'd your meeting go?

41:15.105 --> 41:16.572
Um...

41:17.942 --> 41:19.170
Not very good.

41:19.210 --> 41:23.704
I tried to focus on work
and not deal with my feelings,

41:23.747 --> 41:25.374
and I failed.

41:26.150 --> 41:30.553
They came back around
and bit me on the... You know.

41:31.388 --> 41:33.356
Well, I'd better get back to it.

41:33.390 --> 41:36.882
Who knows, today might be
the day it all turns around.
