00:23.254 --> 00:26.007
Hello. I'm Linda Lee Cadwell.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.927
I welcome you to this
special laserdisc edition...

00:29.014 --> 00:32.323
of Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story.

00:32.414 --> 00:36.566
The film you're about to see
is the story of a real human being:

00:36.654 --> 00:39.248
a struggling person,
a loving person...

00:39.334 --> 00:42.963
with a great many levels
to his character.

00:43.054 --> 00:47.684
When I first spoke to Rob Cohen,
the director and cowriter of Dragon...

00:47.774 --> 00:51.210
about making a motion picture
of my husband's life...

00:51.294 --> 00:55.572
I told him that I wanted people
to know about Bruce Lee the man.

00:55.654 --> 00:58.088
Not just the powerful
martial artist...

00:58.174 --> 01:00.847
but also the loving
husband and father...

01:00.934 --> 01:04.449
the philosopher and the teacher.

01:04.534 --> 01:07.844
Rob's creation
is the story of that man.

01:07.934 --> 01:12.450
Even before Bruce Lee was a role model
to millions of young people...

01:12.534 --> 01:15.412
he was a role model
to his own children.

01:15.494 --> 01:19.726
Before he was a heroic image
to people all over the world...

01:19.814 --> 01:22.965
he was a hero in our own lives.

01:23.054 --> 01:25.966
Dragon will give you insight
into Bruce Lee...

01:26.054 --> 01:29.126
the man who became a hero.

01:29.214 --> 01:33.765
As you'll see from watching Dragon,
Bruce had a tremendous energy.

01:33.854 --> 01:37.563
ln fact, as a child
he was called Mao Tse-tung...

01:37.654 --> 01:40.566
Chinese for " never sits still."

01:40.654 --> 01:45.091
This energy fired the creative essence
of his entire being.

01:45.174 --> 01:49.087
He had the remarkable capability
of channeling this energy...

01:49.174 --> 01:52.962
focusing it, disciplining it
to serve his goals.

01:53.054 --> 01:55.204
This high-intensity energy...

01:55.294 --> 01:58.764
is also the essence of this film.

01:58.854 --> 02:01.129
Bruce could be funny
and lighthearted.

02:01.214 --> 02:05.446
l've never laughed so much in my life
as I did when I was with him.

02:05.534 --> 02:08.048
And he could be tender and kind.

02:08.133 --> 02:12.366
He had so much to give in his life,
and he gave it all.

02:12.454 --> 02:15.924
A life need not be measured
in numbers of years...

02:16.014 --> 02:19.211
but by the contributions
of the individual.

02:19.294 --> 02:22.650
By this measure,
Bruce was a sage.

02:22.734 --> 02:25.043
Saint Augustine once said...

02:25.134 --> 02:27.204
"The key to immortality...

02:27.294 --> 02:31.412
is first living a life
worth remembering."

02:31.494 --> 02:34.884
There was also a much deeper side
to Bruce's personality...

02:34.974 --> 02:37.568
that Dragon tells
especially well...

02:37.654 --> 02:40.805
and that is
his philosophical side.

02:40.894 --> 02:44.284
lmmersed in the Eastern
and Western philosophies...

02:44.374 --> 02:47.525
Bruce was a great
and deep thinker...

02:47.614 --> 02:52.210
always contemplating life
and the meaning of his own existence.

02:52.294 --> 02:54.410
Through study and intuition...

02:54.494 --> 02:57.964
he had an inner awareness
of his own potential...

02:58.054 --> 03:01.490
and he strove constantly
to fulfill it.

03:01.574 --> 03:05.169
He was a student,
a teacher and an artist.

03:05.254 --> 03:09.725
To him, the discipline of martial arts
was not just a means to fight better...

03:09.814 --> 03:12.089
it was a way to live better...

03:12.174 --> 03:15.769
through the perfection
of his mind and body.

03:15.854 --> 03:19.608
By increasing his powers of awareness
through self-knowledge...

03:19.694 --> 03:23.448
Bruce was constantly fine-tuning
his inner perceptions...

03:23.534 --> 03:27.686
and their relationship
to things going on around him.

03:27.774 --> 03:30.413
Through his own process
of self-evaluation...

03:30.494 --> 03:33.247
he evolved his own martial arts...

03:33.334 --> 03:36.531
which he called " jeet kune do."

03:36.614 --> 03:38.570
When he was offered
the chance to make films...

03:38.654 --> 03:42.727
Bruce saw an opportunity
to show his beloved Chinese culture...

03:42.814 --> 03:45.248
and his special art to millions.

03:45.334 --> 03:49.452
And as usual, he focused
all of his energy on it.

03:49.534 --> 03:52.207
Here was a chance
to communicate to people...

03:52.294 --> 03:54.967
how he felt about
the martial arts...

03:55.054 --> 03:57.773
and to show
his way of living it...

03:57.854 --> 04:02.928
and to show the world the unique
power and beauty of Asian culture.

04:03.014 --> 04:06.404
The world of the motion picture
became the best classroom...

04:06.494 --> 04:11.045
for the teachings of
the Little Dragon, La Siu Lom.

04:11.134 --> 04:13.807
With his new ambition, though,
came new boundaries...

04:13.894 --> 04:17.045
mostly in the negative ways
that Asians were depicted...

04:17.134 --> 04:19.523
in film and television.

04:19.613 --> 04:22.890
Bruce wasn't a person
who recognized barriers of any sort...

04:22.974 --> 04:25.647
either in filmmaking
or martial arts.

04:25.734 --> 04:30.012
He wouldn't be a party
to the stereotypes of the time.

04:30.094 --> 04:33.404
ln tearing down the barriers
of fear and prejudice...

04:33.494 --> 04:37.043
that were so firmly entrenched
in Western filmmaking...

04:37.134 --> 04:39.887
Bruce opened the door
for people of all races...

04:39.974 --> 04:45.173
cultures and disabilities
to fulfill their potentials.

04:45.254 --> 04:48.451
Bruce's work crossed the boundaries
of film and martial arts...

04:48.534 --> 04:54.291
and showed people in all walks of life
that they could realize their dreams.

04:54.374 --> 04:57.571
lf somebody told Bruce
he couldn't do something...

04:57.654 --> 05:01.772
he would not accept it
without exploring and examining it.

05:01.854 --> 05:04.732
While he had great respect
for tradition...

05:04.814 --> 05:08.443
he was not a slave to it,
and if he saw a better way...

05:08.534 --> 05:12.368
he was faithful to
the integrity of his opinions.

05:12.454 --> 05:16.686
He ruffled some feathers, but he
also changed a lot of attitudes...

05:16.774 --> 05:19.811
and he definitely
changed the way martial arts...

05:19.894 --> 05:22.772
and Asian culture are perceived.

05:22.854 --> 05:25.926
Now 20 years after he left us...

05:26.014 --> 05:28.926
he's still changing people's attitudes.

05:29.014 --> 05:31.733
This is what
the film Dragon does so well.

05:31.814 --> 05:35.124
lt does not show
Bruce Lee, a Chinese man...

05:35.214 --> 05:37.774
or Bruce Lee, a fighting man...

05:37.854 --> 05:40.527
or Bruce Lee, a family man.

05:40.614 --> 05:43.174
lt is all of these
and none of these.

05:43.254 --> 05:48.453
Dragon is about Bruce Lee,
a real human being.

05:48.534 --> 05:52.049
I'm often asked to speculate
on what Bruce would be doing now...

05:52.134 --> 05:54.045
if he were still here.

05:54.134 --> 05:58.093
I think it's safe to say that
he would still be involved in film.

05:58.174 --> 06:00.529
He loved film,
and it was his passion...

06:00.614 --> 06:03.287
to share his philosophy
with the whole world...

06:03.374 --> 06:07.925
through a medium that could
entertain as well as inform.

06:08.014 --> 06:12.212
He would probably have continued
to write and produce his own pictures...

06:12.294 --> 06:14.967
and to create opportunities
for others...

06:15.054 --> 06:18.285
to create their own
special kind of art.

06:18.374 --> 06:22.162
And Bruce, I am sure,
would have loved Dragon.

06:22.254 --> 06:25.132
Rob Cohen has done
justice to the man.

06:25.214 --> 06:27.284
And as for Jason Scott Lee...

06:27.374 --> 06:30.525
I almost feel that it was worth
waiting for all this time...

06:30.614 --> 06:34.846
for Jason to grow up
and be old enough to play Bruce.

06:34.934 --> 06:39.166
I sincerely hope you enjoy
Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story.

06:39.254 --> 06:42.246
Watch it with the knowledge
that you are indeed witnessing...

06:42.334 --> 06:45.007
the true humor, wisdom...

06:45.094 --> 06:49.007
and yes,
the power of the man I knew.

12:43.648 --> 12:46.446
Kung fu is more than
a system of fighting.

12:46.488 --> 12:48.558
lt's a system of thought.

12:48.648 --> 12:52.800
You must outthink your opponent,
whatever form he takes...

12:52.848 --> 12:56.807
because some of them
will be more than just men.

12:56.848 --> 12:59.567
What else could it be, sifu?

12:59.648 --> 13:02.606
We all have inner demons
to fight.

13:02.688 --> 13:07.079
We call these demons fear
and hatred and anger.

13:07.128 --> 13:10.598
lf you don't conquer them,
then a life of a hundred years...

13:10.648 --> 13:12.525
is a tragedy.

13:12.568 --> 13:14.843
lf you do,
a life of a single day...

13:14.888 --> 13:17.482
can be a triumph.

13:58.408 --> 14:01.241
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry.

14:02.528 --> 14:04.598
Excuse me, my son.

14:06.168 --> 14:07.999
Uh, six pints
of beer, mate.

14:08.088 --> 14:10.602
- No.
- Aw, come on.

14:13.568 --> 14:16.036
Oh, God, what about
that one there?

14:30.608 --> 14:33.406
Hello. Mind if I take over?
Go on, piss off!

14:34.528 --> 14:37.326
Big boy!

14:39.528 --> 14:41.519
Hey, look,
I'm Fred Astaire!

14:51.288 --> 14:53.438
She's a bit frisky, isn't she?

14:53.528 --> 14:58.204
Oh, yeah. Come on, one, two.
Oh, I love it when they fight back.

14:58.248 --> 15:00.284
One, two, come on!

15:00.328 --> 15:03.525
Stay back. Stay back.
Back in-- Hey, hey! Back in line.

15:08.968 --> 15:11.766
- What do you want?
- I want to dance with her.

15:11.848 --> 15:14.646
This one's mine.
Get one of your own.

15:16.648 --> 15:19.162
She is one of my own.

15:40.408 --> 15:42.717
Hold it, lads.

15:42.768 --> 15:46.522
Leave him to me.
Come on, try that again.

15:46.568 --> 15:50.004
I'm gonna get you,
you little yellow bastard.

15:50.088 --> 15:52.648
Smash your face in.

15:52.728 --> 15:54.559
Try it again, huh?

16:40.488 --> 16:41.477
Hey, Bob!

16:49.368 --> 16:51.199
Wanna try this?

16:55.448 --> 16:58.406
Okay.

18:04.168 --> 18:06.238
Papa!

18:06.328 --> 18:09.479
The police were here.
They're looking for you.

18:09.568 --> 18:12.480
- I know.
- The sailor's in hospital
with a punctured lung.

18:12.568 --> 18:15.605
- He might die.
- He was making trouble.
He started it.

18:15.688 --> 18:19.476
He's the nephew of the Assistant
Police lnspector of Kowloon.

18:19.528 --> 18:21.996
I can hide out
with my friends.

18:22.088 --> 18:24.966
You don't have
any friends now!

18:37.888 --> 18:40.482
The cops will be back.

18:40.528 --> 18:43.042
I should
get out of here.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.965
Sit down.

18:50.288 --> 18:52.563
l've thought a lot
about this...

18:52.648 --> 18:55.685
for a very long time.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.965
- You'll have to leave Hong Kong.
- For how long?

18:59.048 --> 19:00.879
Forever.

19:02.488 --> 19:05.446
This is a joke, right?
You're joking.

19:05.528 --> 19:09.919
Listen to me, Sai-Fong, you'll die
in Hong Kong. l've seen it.

19:10.008 --> 19:12.966
You're too superstitious,
Papa.

19:18.008 --> 19:19.999
You're a man now.
Almost.

19:20.088 --> 19:23.364
You have a right to know everything.
You had an older brother.

19:23.408 --> 19:26.559
He died in childbirth.

19:26.608 --> 19:28.838
The demon took him
away from us.

19:28.928 --> 19:32.000
The firstborn man-child
is very valuable.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.922
So when you were born,
I name you Sai-Fong, a girl's name.

19:36.008 --> 19:40.399
We dress you in dresses so the demon
wouldn't know I had another son.

19:40.488 --> 19:44.003
I made you speak English,
all so we could fool him.

19:44.088 --> 19:45.919
But now he knows.

19:47.248 --> 19:49.125
And he's coming for you.

19:50.568 --> 19:53.036
You must leave tonight.

19:53.128 --> 19:55.164
Where, Papa?
Where can I go?

19:55.208 --> 19:58.359
You love American movies.

19:58.408 --> 20:00.968
You love American cars.

20:01.008 --> 20:04.159
- You go to America.
- America?

20:04.248 --> 20:07.843
I was in America on tour
with the Canton Opera Company in 1940.

20:07.888 --> 20:11.005
San Francisco.
Doing The Drunken Princess.

20:11.048 --> 20:13.403
November 27th,
you were born.

20:13.448 --> 20:16.758
That morning I got you
and three good reviews.

20:16.808 --> 20:19.686
I was very proud.
Come here. Come here.

20:25.168 --> 20:27.045
This...

20:27.088 --> 20:29.079
is your birth
certificate.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.358
"Bruce Lee."

20:31.448 --> 20:34.804
- lt sounded very American.
- lt sure does.

20:38.408 --> 20:41.445
You were born there.
Show this to the immigration man.

20:41.528 --> 20:44.645
They have to let you in.

20:44.688 --> 20:46.565
You need money
to go to America.

20:51.848 --> 20:53.725
lt's yours.

20:54.768 --> 20:57.123
I saved it for you...

20:57.168 --> 20:59.045
for a day like today.

21:02.848 --> 21:04.884
I don't know
what to say.

21:08.888 --> 21:10.879
Say you'll do better.

21:10.968 --> 21:13.357
Tell me you'll make
a big noise in America...

21:13.448 --> 21:16.246
so I can hear it
over here.

21:42.728 --> 21:45.959
No.

21:46.048 --> 21:47.879
- Do you speak English?
- Yeah.

21:47.968 --> 21:51.438
I'm practicing my English.
Going to America.

21:51.528 --> 21:53.996
l've always wanted
to go to America.

21:55.608 --> 21:58.361
James Dean.

21:58.408 --> 22:01.559
French Fries. The sky's the limit,
that's what they say.

22:01.608 --> 22:05.044
Not a Chinaman's chance.
They say that too.

22:05.128 --> 22:07.961
- You ever hear that?
- No.

22:08.008 --> 22:11.887
You know, the Chinese,
we built the railroads there.

22:11.968 --> 22:14.402
The Americans, the gwailo,
would lower Chinamens...

22:14.488 --> 22:17.525
over the cliff in baskets
to set the dynamite.

22:17.608 --> 22:21.123
Get pulled up too slow,
bang!

22:21.208 --> 22:23.164
Rope break.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.597
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

22:25.688 --> 22:27.679
Bye-bye.

22:27.768 --> 22:32.125
Americans say,
"Not a Chinaman's chance" ...

22:32.168 --> 22:34.728
and round-eyed gwailo
would laugh.

22:36.368 --> 22:38.245
We're not human to them.

22:39.688 --> 22:42.248
- How do you know?
- I'm a history teacher.

22:44.728 --> 22:46.878
Things are different now.
lt's today.

22:46.968 --> 22:50.881
- Sure, sure. Maybe.
- I'm different.

22:50.928 --> 22:53.283
Sure. Sure.

22:53.328 --> 22:56.240
I am. You'll see.

23:13.408 --> 23:17.287
Order, please. One pork lo mein,
one kung pao chicken.

23:17.368 --> 23:20.007
Hey. Hey.

23:20.048 --> 23:21.959
Hi.

23:22.048 --> 23:24.004
My name is April.

23:24.048 --> 23:26.437
- Bruce.
- I know.

23:29.848 --> 23:32.442
Hey, Lee! Clean up!

23:34.888 --> 23:37.527
Hey, Lee! Clean up!

23:41.448 --> 23:44.758
- Lee, clean it up.
- Yes, Miss Yang.

23:44.808 --> 23:49.006
Mr. Ho, you're here to cook,
not to make trouble.

24:32.128 --> 24:35.279
Go! Fight!

24:35.368 --> 24:38.166
Win!
Go, fight, win!

24:38.248 --> 24:40.716
Hit it! Whoo!

24:40.808 --> 24:43.606
Michael! Come on! Yeah!

24:45.288 --> 24:47.119
You know what Margaret Mead--

24:47.208 --> 24:51.520
Go! Fight! Win!

24:51.568 --> 24:53.445
Go, fight, win!
Hit it!

25:16.328 --> 25:19.126
"'And I have made
a mistake,' Robert Jor--

25:19.208 --> 25:22.837
Robert Jor-- Jordan
thought to himself.

25:22.888 --> 25:25.356
'I have told
the Spaniards...

25:25.448 --> 25:27.837
we could do
something better...'"

25:27.928 --> 25:30.726
Better-err. Better.

25:30.768 --> 25:33.123
"'Than they can.'"

25:58.368 --> 26:02.122
One order peking duck.

26:02.208 --> 26:04.039
Ah.

26:09.608 --> 26:12.247
You son of a bitch!

26:12.328 --> 26:14.364
You grab my girl!

26:25.128 --> 26:27.198
Give me a knife! Aah!

27:52.008 --> 27:54.886
Get the son of a bitch!
Kill him! Kill him!

29:41.608 --> 29:43.997
Get back inside, all of you!

29:44.048 --> 29:45.925
Come on! Come on!

30:02.968 --> 30:05.118
Sit down.

30:16.808 --> 30:18.639
Two weeks pay.

30:20.888 --> 30:23.197
Two weeks severance.

30:28.808 --> 30:32.437
- What's this?
- All-purpose loan.

30:32.488 --> 30:35.321
You got a lot of money, Lee.
What you gonna do?

30:35.368 --> 30:37.279
- I guess l'd better--
- I tell you what to do.

30:37.328 --> 30:40.843
Take April on the town.

30:40.928 --> 30:44.159
Buy her nice clothes.
Check into big hotel.

30:44.208 --> 30:46.722
Have lots of sex.

30:46.768 --> 30:48.963
Have food brought up
to you in bed.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.879
Drink champagne
and whiskey.

30:50.968 --> 30:53.687
Now money all gone.

30:55.208 --> 30:58.245
April be gone, too,
like money.

30:58.288 --> 31:00.165
You come back to me.

31:00.208 --> 31:02.642
I put you in kitchen,
wash dishes to pay back loan.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.765
By that time you're no longer young,
you're no longer handsome.

31:05.808 --> 31:08.686
You're nothing
but a... dishwasher.

31:10.168 --> 31:13.205
That one choice.
There are others.

31:13.288 --> 31:15.119
Like what?

31:15.208 --> 31:18.166
They say education
is good. Hmm.

31:18.248 --> 31:21.877
l've heard that.
Me, personally...

31:21.928 --> 31:24.283
I hope you go
with April.

31:24.328 --> 31:26.796
I can always use
a good...

31:26.888 --> 31:29.925
dishwasher!

32:06.008 --> 32:09.125
- Time's up. Come on, man.
- I'm not... finished yet.

32:09.168 --> 32:11.079
Yeah, you are.
We work out at 3:00.

32:11.168 --> 32:13.602
See that clock?
lt's 3:00. Come on.

32:13.688 --> 32:16.964
- Where does it say that
in the rule book?
- Ooh. The rule book.

32:17.048 --> 32:20.802
You been readin' the wrong rule books.
Read the ones in English.

32:22.728 --> 32:25.288
- What's that mean?
- See? That's what I mean.

32:25.368 --> 32:27.199
Your kind
don't understand English.

32:27.288 --> 32:29.279
- My kind?
- Yeah.

32:29.368 --> 32:31.757
Gooks, chinks. You guys
killed my dad in Korea.

32:31.848 --> 32:34.999
- You think I'm happy
to see you in my gym?
- Don't touch me.

32:37.928 --> 32:41.841
- Or what? Huh?
- Or l'll touch you back.

32:44.168 --> 32:47.046
Come on, touch me, dink.
Come on.

32:47.088 --> 32:50.239
- Come on, touch me, chink. Come on.
- Hit him, Joe.

32:50.328 --> 32:53.604
Quit looking at him
and touch me, chink.

32:53.648 --> 32:56.321
Come on, man.

32:56.368 --> 32:59.280
He's scared of you, man.

32:59.368 --> 33:02.405
He's scared.

33:02.448 --> 33:05.360
- Mr. Henderson, we so sorry.
- Are you coming?

33:05.448 --> 33:08.326
I have to finish
my workout.

33:08.368 --> 33:10.757
Might as well finish
on you.

33:14.088 --> 33:17.524
- Finish him, Joe.
- Okay, chink, let's go.

33:19.368 --> 33:21.199
Ken, Andy,
get off the mat!

33:21.288 --> 33:24.598
- Go on, man,
I'm gonna kill this guy.
- You can take him, Joe.

33:24.648 --> 33:26.525
Wait.

33:26.568 --> 33:29.878
What is this? What are you gonna do,
stink me to death?

33:29.928 --> 33:31.805
Come on! Come on.

33:31.848 --> 33:34.681
Wait. Wait.
So sorry.

33:36.248 --> 33:39.604
Oh! What is this,
a fight or a striptease?

33:39.688 --> 33:42.998
Come on! Come on!

33:43.048 --> 33:44.766
- Okay, I ready.
- Yeah?

33:48.368 --> 33:50.723
Aah! Very good
shadow boxing!

33:50.808 --> 33:52.878
You... Aaaah!

33:54.648 --> 33:57.242
- Chinks can jump real high, huh?
- Come on, Joe!

33:57.288 --> 33:59.961
Come on.

34:00.008 --> 34:03.239
Come on, show him what for, Joe.

34:03.328 --> 34:05.159
Aaah!

34:05.248 --> 34:07.603
- Get up, Joe!
- l'll kill you, you bastard!

34:07.688 --> 34:11.362
I'm no bastard. I'm Bruce Lee!

34:30.568 --> 34:34.686
Sorry about your father.
That was Koreans.

34:34.728 --> 34:37.083
I'm an American.

34:44.328 --> 34:47.922
- You sure showed him, Henderson!
- Yeah, way to go, Joe.

34:55.208 --> 34:58.405
Hey!
Ease up, ease up.

34:58.488 --> 35:00.319
We come in peace.

35:00.408 --> 35:02.399
I'm Benny Sayles
and this is Tad Overton.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.598
We just wanna ask you
a question.

35:04.648 --> 35:06.957
That jujitsu stuff.
Can you teach us?

35:07.048 --> 35:08.879
Can anybody do it?

35:11.368 --> 35:14.246
I told you.
lt's secret chink stuff.

35:15.848 --> 35:17.725
Aaaaah!

35:17.768 --> 35:20.157
Shit.

35:20.208 --> 35:24.167
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

35:24.208 --> 35:27.518
You see that? You see how it flowed?
Be like water.

35:27.608 --> 35:29.485
Water's the softest stuff
in the world...

35:29.568 --> 35:31.399
but it can fit
into any container.

35:31.488 --> 35:35.367
lt seems weak,
but it can penetrate rock.

35:35.448 --> 35:38.440
Be like the nature
of water.

35:38.528 --> 35:40.996
That's it for today.
Friday we spar, eh?

35:41.088 --> 35:42.919
- All right.
- All right.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.839
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Linda.

35:44.928 --> 35:47.044
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

35:47.128 --> 35:49.119
ls this class
only for guys?

35:49.168 --> 35:51.363
'Cause it looks like
you only teach guys.

35:51.408 --> 35:55.526
I teach whoever wants to learn.
Usually guys are the ones
interested in fighting.

35:55.568 --> 35:57.445
l've dated some
of these animals.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.321
- l've done plenty of fighting.
- Ha ha.
- Ooh!

36:00.368 --> 36:03.997
But seriously, l'd like
to take lessons.

36:04.088 --> 36:06.886
How about Friday?
3:00?

36:06.968 --> 36:08.799
That's a date.

36:08.888 --> 36:11.686
No, that's an appointment.

36:11.768 --> 36:14.840
- There's a difference.
- See ya, Bruce.

36:14.888 --> 36:17.402
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Linda.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.282
Emotion can be the enemy.

36:26.368 --> 36:29.087
lf you give in to emotion,
you can lose yourself.

36:29.128 --> 36:31.596
Be at one
with your emotions...

36:31.688 --> 36:35.363
because the body
always follows the mind.

36:35.408 --> 36:37.717
This is not about winning.

36:37.768 --> 36:39.645
This is about perfection.

36:40.848 --> 36:43.043
Then why all those
colored belts?

36:43.088 --> 36:45.682
The only thing belts are good for
is to hold your pants up.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.759
Okay, let's spar,
shall we?

36:47.848 --> 36:49.839
Um, Linda?

36:51.208 --> 36:53.927
Linda and...

36:55.848 --> 36:58.885
Linda and me, I guess.
Come, Linda.

36:58.968 --> 37:00.799
Go get 'em, Linda.

37:02.448 --> 37:04.439
- Remember reference? Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

37:06.728 --> 37:08.559
Set?

37:11.368 --> 37:13.438
You're open.

37:13.528 --> 37:15.359
I saw it coming.

37:18.328 --> 37:20.444
- Uhh!
- Yeah!

37:20.488 --> 37:24.401
There you go. You see?
lt isn't size or strength that matters.

37:24.488 --> 37:27.844
lt's focus.
You all have a chi, an inner spirit.

37:27.928 --> 37:30.237
Focus and then there's nothing
you cannot bend to your will.

37:30.328 --> 37:32.159
Like you just saw.

37:32.248 --> 37:35.763
Find your reference points
and square off.

37:35.848 --> 37:38.043
Good.

37:38.088 --> 37:40.397
I kinda
like this position.

37:40.488 --> 37:42.365
Then say " yes"
to a date.

37:42.408 --> 37:44.285
- All of us?
- No, just you and me.

37:44.328 --> 37:46.205
- Why?
- Why?

37:46.248 --> 37:49.923
- Yeah, why? Why me?
- 'Cause I already fell for you.

37:50.448 --> 37:54.077
Premier Nikita Khrushchev made his
first visit to the Berlin Wall today.

37:54.168 --> 37:56.762
With his entourage,
he surveyed the structure...

37:56.808 --> 37:59.880
- which has made a division--
- Bye, Mom! I'm going bowling!

37:59.968 --> 38:02.243
- I'm not deaf.
- I'm sorry.

38:02.328 --> 38:05.126
- You're going where?
- I'm going bowling.

38:05.208 --> 38:08.325
- Have fun. Not too late, now.
- Okay. Nope.

38:08.368 --> 38:11.041
Bowling, for Christ's sakes, Emery?

38:11.128 --> 38:13.198
Couldn't you think
of something better? Bowling?

38:13.288 --> 38:15.677
Give me a break, Sherry.
I needed the bag.

38:18.648 --> 38:21.116
Hey, watch that upholstery!
lt's my father's car.

38:21.208 --> 38:23.039
Okay! Watch the road!

38:23.128 --> 38:27.201
I don't believe you.

38:27.288 --> 38:31.281
Oh. You think he likes blue?

38:31.368 --> 38:34.405
Do you think this dress
is too wrinkled?

38:34.448 --> 38:36.962
All this
for a Chinese guy.

38:37.008 --> 38:39.966
I can't believe you're going out
with a Chinese guy.

38:40.008 --> 38:42.397
Well, let me tell ya,
if you met him...

38:42.448 --> 38:44.325
you'd get it.

38:44.368 --> 38:47.485
I don't think I could kiss
somebody who wasn't white.

38:47.528 --> 38:49.758
l-l just don't think
I could do that.

38:49.848 --> 38:52.646
l'll try and live with that thought.
I really will.

38:52.728 --> 38:56.243
- You'd kiss him?
- Kiss him? At least.

38:56.328 --> 39:00.162
You'd let him put his tongue
in your mouth. A Chinese guy.

39:00.248 --> 39:02.716
Who knows? Maybe more.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.606
You are so low, Emery.

39:05.648 --> 39:07.843
You pretend to be this jock...

39:07.888 --> 39:10.004
but you're a, a beatnik.

39:10.088 --> 39:13.558
Ooh. Pass me the bongos,
daddy-o.

39:21.448 --> 39:23.279
Hi.

39:27.208 --> 39:29.039
- You look great.
- Thanks.

39:29.128 --> 39:33.041
- Blue looks good on you.
- I'm glad you like it.
You look really good yourself.

39:33.128 --> 39:35.847
l've never seen you
with so many clothes on.

39:35.888 --> 39:38.356
- Wanna get a table?
- Yeah. Okay.

39:39.368 --> 39:42.326
Lee. We have
reservations at 8:00.

39:44.728 --> 39:47.879
I'm sorry. I don't have
a table right now.

39:47.968 --> 39:50.562
Perhaps you'd like
to sit at the bar.

39:50.648 --> 39:52.684
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

39:54.728 --> 39:58.243
A philosophy major. Now what can
you do with a philosophy major?

39:58.328 --> 40:01.445
You can think deep thoughts
about being unemployed.

40:01.488 --> 40:05.276
You're such a good teacher. Have you
ever thought about teaching kung fu?

40:05.328 --> 40:07.205
What do you think
l've been doing?

40:07.288 --> 40:11.884
No, but I mean really going for it.
ln the American way.

40:11.968 --> 40:14.880
Making a business.
A chain, like McDonald's.

40:14.928 --> 40:17.601
I like teaching, but--

40:17.688 --> 40:20.805
Oh, sure, it's fun to throw
helpless girls on the floor.

40:20.848 --> 40:23.316
Seriously, I like the way
it changes people.

40:23.368 --> 40:27.680
You can't change people
with your fists. l've learned that.

40:27.728 --> 40:31.482
See, they see something strange,
something they don't understand...

40:31.528 --> 40:33.405
and they get afraid.

40:33.448 --> 40:35.882
Teach them the beauty of that strange
thing and they're no longer afraid...

40:35.968 --> 40:38.641
because it's become
part of them.

40:38.728 --> 40:41.925
Well, sometimes strange things
can be very beautiful.

40:44.368 --> 40:46.404
Excuse me.

40:46.488 --> 40:50.242
lt's been half an hour and I still
see people being seated ahead of us.

40:50.328 --> 40:53.126
Come, don't exaggerate.
lt's been barely twenty minutes.

40:58.088 --> 41:00.886
Like to have
our check, please.

41:00.968 --> 41:03.323
- I was thinking.
- What were you thinking?

41:03.368 --> 41:06.405
l'd like to take you
someplace else...

41:06.448 --> 41:08.484
someplace good.

41:08.568 --> 41:10.399
Thank you.

41:34.568 --> 41:36.445
Two for
Breakfast At Tiffany's.

41:36.488 --> 41:39.685
- Hey, baby, what's going on here?
- Oh, hi.

41:39.768 --> 41:41.599
- You're gonna love this movie.
- Oh, yeah?

41:55.128 --> 41:57.881
- You remember?
- Miss-a Go-right-ry!

41:57.928 --> 41:59.964
I protest!

42:00.008 --> 42:03.717
I lost my key.

42:03.808 --> 42:05.639
But that was two weeks ago.

42:05.728 --> 42:08.162
You cannot keep
ringing my bell!

42:08.208 --> 42:11.359
You disturb-a me.
You must have a key made!

42:11.408 --> 42:13.763
lt won't do any good.
l'll just lose them all.

42:13.848 --> 42:18.080
- You like me. You know you do.
- Come on, baby, what is this?

42:18.128 --> 42:20.005
You like me.
I'm a liked guy.

42:20.048 --> 42:23.279
ln thirty seconds, I going
to call the po-rice!

42:23.368 --> 42:27.122
I got to get my rest!
I'm an artist.

42:27.208 --> 42:29.244
Let's get out of here.

42:29.288 --> 42:32.485
Don't be angry. I won't do it again.

42:32.528 --> 42:34.405
lf you promise
not to be angry...

42:34.448 --> 42:38.361
- I might let you take those
pictures we mentioned.
- When?

43:07.048 --> 43:10.085
What is this place?
What are we doing here?

43:10.128 --> 43:12.483
- Come on, be a little adventurous.
- Where are you taking me?

43:34.088 --> 43:37.763
- Well, what do you think?
- I don't know what to think.

43:37.848 --> 43:41.045
What do you mean you don't know
what to think? This was your idea.

43:41.128 --> 43:43.926
My idea, to move into
an industrial slum?

43:44.008 --> 43:46.681
This is no slum!

43:46.728 --> 43:50.323
This is the first
Bruce Lee Kung Fu lnstitute.

43:50.408 --> 43:53.605
You talked me
into it.

43:53.688 --> 43:56.839
You make me feel
like I can do anything.

44:06.168 --> 44:08.477
You can.

44:13.848 --> 44:16.806
When I came over on the boat,
I knew this was an " idea" place.

44:16.848 --> 44:22.241
Ideas make this country great.
Here a good idea makes a man
anything he wants to be.

44:22.328 --> 44:26.606
You drop a pebble in a pond,
you get ripples.

44:26.688 --> 44:30.567
Soon the ripples
cross the whole pond.

44:30.648 --> 44:33.446
Come here.

44:38.808 --> 44:41.606
Drop it.

44:45.408 --> 44:48.206
See, it's begun.

45:31.968 --> 45:34.562
Set.

45:34.608 --> 45:37.998
One! Two! Three!

45:38.088 --> 45:41.285
One! Two! Three!

45:41.368 --> 45:44.804
One! Two! Three!

45:44.888 --> 45:49.279
One! Two! Three!

45:49.328 --> 45:52.764
One! Two! Three!

48:17.488 --> 48:22.164
What is wrong with you today?
You're acting so funny.

48:23.368 --> 48:25.723
Hmm?

48:30.008 --> 48:32.124
Well, I gotta go.

48:32.168 --> 48:35.285
I told Mom l'd
help her with dinner.

48:35.368 --> 48:39.759
Your mother must think
you're a professional bowler by now.

48:39.848 --> 48:42.123
- I'm gonna tell her.
- When?

48:45.808 --> 48:48.880
When I'm ready.

48:48.968 --> 48:51.038
Are you ashamed?

48:51.128 --> 48:54.882
Are you ashamed
you wanna marry a Chinaman?

48:56.328 --> 48:59.798
No, I'm not ashamed.

48:59.848 --> 49:02.840
Are you ashamed of me?
Did you tell your father about me?

49:02.888 --> 49:06.403
Did you tell him about
your little gwailo girl?

49:06.488 --> 49:09.286
Yes.

49:11.448 --> 49:14.008
What did he say?

49:14.088 --> 49:16.807
Doesn't matter
what he said.

49:16.888 --> 49:19.686
What matters
is I told him.

49:25.448 --> 49:27.723
Okay.

49:31.528 --> 49:34.679
Okay.

49:34.728 --> 49:37.561
I'm gonna tell her.

49:40.328 --> 49:44.116
She's just not gonna
understand, Bruce.

49:45.248 --> 49:47.478
- Sugar, Mr. Lee?
- Please.

49:47.528 --> 49:50.201
- Cream?
- No.

49:50.248 --> 49:54.446
- How many sugars?
- Just one.

49:54.528 --> 49:57.884
- Linda, you want some coffee, too?
- No, thank you.

49:59.048 --> 50:01.004
Thank you.

50:01.088 --> 50:04.285
- Cookie?
- No.

50:05.768 --> 50:08.077
Are you pregnant?

50:10.928 --> 50:13.726
No.

50:16.808 --> 50:20.562
Okay. Okay.

50:22.248 --> 50:25.445
Let's look at this from all angles.
How will you live?

50:25.488 --> 50:29.322
l'm opening a school in Oakland.
Maybe one in Palo Alto?

50:29.408 --> 50:32.206
Soon it'll become
a chain like McDonald's.

50:32.288 --> 50:36.167
I don't wanna rain on
your parade, Mr. Lee, but
the world needs hamburgers.

50:36.208 --> 50:38.403
- lt doesn't need judo.
- Kung fu.

50:38.448 --> 50:40.325
Whatever.

50:40.368 --> 50:43.087
More and more people
are studying it all the time.

50:43.168 --> 50:47.878
- That's how l
put myself through school.
- Okay, l'll give you that.

50:47.968 --> 50:52.359
So let's get down to
the real issue: children.

50:52.448 --> 50:56.077
After all, Linda, that's what
marriage is really about: children.

51:01.568 --> 51:04.002
We wanna have children,
someday.

51:04.088 --> 51:08.240
Ah. But what
will they be?

51:08.328 --> 51:11.206
They won't be white
and they won't be Oriental.

51:11.288 --> 51:15.042
They'll be some kind of half-breed, and
they won't be accepted by either side.

51:15.088 --> 51:18.364
They'll be American.
Linda's American, I'm American.

51:18.408 --> 51:21.844
You're an American citizen.
You're not really an American.

51:27.528 --> 51:30.645
- Bruce.
- You'd better put
a Band-Aid on that cut.

51:30.728 --> 51:34.721
Bruce. Bruce!

51:34.808 --> 51:37.641
I spoke to him like a gentleman.
You heard me.

51:37.728 --> 51:39.480
- My favorite china.
- Mom--

51:39.528 --> 51:43.965
You can do better than that. Believe me,
you'll forget about him in a month.

51:44.008 --> 51:46.317
Do you really wanna
have yellow babies?

51:46.408 --> 51:49.366
- Can you imagine that,
yellow babies? Oh, Linda.
- Yes, I can.

51:49.448 --> 51:52.246
All this will do is bring you pain.
Linda, listen to me.

51:52.328 --> 51:55.365
- I can't allow it. I'm sorry,
but I can't allow it. Linda--
- lt's not up to you.

51:55.448 --> 51:58.246
- Mom, it's not up to you!
- Linda!

51:58.328 --> 52:00.239
Linda! Linda!

52:00.328 --> 52:03.001
- Stop! Wait!
- No! No! No!

52:03.328 --> 52:05.888
Bruce!

52:08.368 --> 52:11.121
Bruce!

52:45.368 --> 52:48.201
- What's this?
- All-purpose loan.

52:48.288 --> 52:51.360
- Where're you going?
- To a wedding!

53:18.088 --> 53:20.522
- Hi, honey!
- Hi, hon.

53:20.608 --> 53:22.724
- Anything?
- Not yet.

53:22.768 --> 53:26.556
- What are you doing?
- Just giving the place
a little blessing.

53:26.608 --> 53:30.044
Well, we don't need a blessing
because we've got advertising.

53:37.888 --> 53:40.083
You open?

53:44.008 --> 53:46.568
Come in, come in.

53:49.568 --> 53:52.241
Caught the flyer.
Thought l'd check it out.

53:52.328 --> 53:54.080
See?

53:54.128 --> 53:57.916
Seen some of them
chop-socky flicks, man.

53:58.008 --> 54:00.568
Some cool shit.

54:00.648 --> 54:03.037
Name's Jerome.
Jerome Sprout.

54:03.088 --> 54:04.885
Bruce Lee.
My wife, Linda.

54:04.968 --> 54:07.084
- Hey.
- Hi, Jerome.

54:07.168 --> 54:09.682
- l'd like to take some lessons.
- I like to give them.

54:09.768 --> 54:14.967
- Solid. Now, you know
I'm not Chinese?
- l've noticed that.

54:15.048 --> 54:18.802
Some of them other Chinese teachers,
man, they turn me down flat.

54:18.888 --> 54:22.005
- Some of 'em wouldn't
even let me in the door.
- You got yourself a teacher.

54:22.088 --> 54:25.683
I can dig it, man.
You got yourself a student.

54:25.768 --> 54:28.646
Keep repeating it.
Now backwards. Go for a switch.

54:28.728 --> 54:31.447
- Like that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

54:31.528 --> 54:35.806
We're gonna speed up a little bit.
All right, ready?

54:36.808 --> 54:38.639
Oh! Whoop!

54:38.728 --> 54:41.765
One! Two! One!

54:41.848 --> 54:44.123
Two! One! Two!

54:44.168 --> 54:47.205
One! Two!
One! Two!

54:47.288 --> 54:50.837
One! Two!
One! Two! One!

54:54.888 --> 54:58.483
One! Two! One! Two!

55:02.248 --> 55:05.399
Thank you.

55:05.448 --> 55:09.521
One! Two!
One! Two!

55:09.608 --> 55:13.362
One! Two!
One! Two!

55:37.608 --> 55:41.521
Bruce. I know you
like to be called Bruce.

55:41.608 --> 55:44.884
You've been charged with
violating the martial arts code.

55:44.968 --> 55:49.837
We've had several complaints
from Wu Zuolin and Wong Jack Man
and many others.

55:49.928 --> 55:52.726
You've been teaching the gwailo.
This must stop.

55:52.808 --> 55:56.164
l'll teach whoever
wants to learn.

55:58.568 --> 56:02.083
Bruce, we do things
differently here.

56:02.128 --> 56:07.122
One of the things we do not do is
teach our secrets to whites, blacks.

56:07.208 --> 56:10.006
They are the enemy.

56:11.728 --> 56:14.686
They are not the enemy.
They just don't know us.

56:14.728 --> 56:17.401
We've been so closed
for so long,

56:17.448 --> 56:20.281
they've never seen the real beauty
of our culture.

56:20.328 --> 56:23.365
- Let's show it to them.
- No. No. No.

56:23.448 --> 56:28.283
I'm sorry. We do not agree. You are
ordered to stop teaching the gwailo.

56:28.328 --> 56:30.205
Or what?

56:30.248 --> 56:33.285
Or we will settle this
by combat.

56:34.288 --> 56:36.165
Prepare yourself.

56:59.088 --> 57:02.239
- Not hungry?
- Nah.

57:12.168 --> 57:17.401
- You canceled all your classes today.
- I had to take care of some business.

57:17.448 --> 57:21.839
- What business?
- Oh, nothing much.

57:21.928 --> 57:23.759
Tax stuff.

57:25.768 --> 57:29.477
- I better get going.
- There's something
you're not telling me.

57:31.928 --> 57:34.886
Do we owe
a lot of money?

57:42.728 --> 57:45.526
I owe everything...

57:46.968 --> 57:49.118
to you.

57:49.168 --> 57:51.523
See you.

58:04.168 --> 58:06.238
What'd you find out?

58:06.288 --> 58:08.802
-Bookies are laying 20 to 1 against you.
-Who is this guy?

58:08.888 --> 58:13.200
Johnny Sun. He's got a school
on Thompson. He's a killer, man.

58:13.288 --> 58:15.927
- What are you, his press agent?
- He's a real killer.

58:16.008 --> 58:18.363
A couple of brothers
tried to rob him last year.

58:18.408 --> 58:22.560
One went to a hospital.
One with a gun went to a funeral home.

58:22.648 --> 58:26.402
You're a real confidence
builder, Jerome.

59:07.968 --> 59:11.324
Man, they eat their
Wheaties in that family.

59:11.368 --> 59:14.087
Tiny there's his
younger brother Luke.

59:14.168 --> 59:16.318
Bruce, forget
about this stuff.

59:16.408 --> 59:21.118
Forget about all us gwailo and let's
get the hell outta here right now.

01:01:34.248 --> 01:01:36.079
Yah!

01:02:15.048 --> 01:02:18.199
Do you give up?
Do you give up?

01:02:18.248 --> 01:02:23.003
- Do you give up?
- I give up. I give up.

01:02:24.488 --> 01:02:27.446
- I give up.
- Right on!

01:02:35.688 --> 01:02:38.566
I teach who I want.

01:02:38.608 --> 01:02:41.042
The decision is mine.

01:03:23.728 --> 01:03:28.006
Dr. Donan, come to the hospital
administration office.

01:03:28.048 --> 01:03:31.120
Dr. Craig and Dr. Donan,
to the hospital administration office.

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:35.042
- Mrs. Lee, I'm Dr. Arlo.
- How is he? ls he okay?

01:03:36.648 --> 01:03:40.118
- Let's not talk in here.
- ls he okay?

01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:54.803
There are some papers
to sign, Mrs. Lee.

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:59.837
- Mrs. Lee.
- Huh?

01:03:59.928 --> 01:04:02.726
Some-- There are some papers.
Some papers.

01:04:26.168 --> 01:04:31.845
You know, this thing's kinda sexy. Maybe
we can keep it after you're better.

01:04:31.888 --> 01:04:34.607
I'm sorry.

01:04:34.688 --> 01:04:37.441
lt was a bad joke.

01:04:40.808 --> 01:04:45.040
I know you're mad. Don't be mad.
lt'll only make things worse.

01:04:45.128 --> 01:04:49.280
Worse? Couldn't take a hell of a lot
to make things worse.

01:04:49.328 --> 01:04:52.764
- You should've told me
where you were going.
- Why?

01:04:52.808 --> 01:04:55.800
Because I'm your wife, that's why!
I had a right to know.

01:04:55.848 --> 01:05:00.046
You might wanna think about that.
The wife part, I mean.

01:05:03.928 --> 01:05:08.001
- What're you saying?
- Take a good look at me, Linda.

01:05:13.088 --> 01:05:15.966
- So we've got a little trouble.
- This is more than a little trouble!

01:05:16.008 --> 01:05:18.203
Okay, so we've got
big trouble!

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:21.046
You're always going on about
the beauties of your Chinese culture!

01:05:21.128 --> 01:05:24.484
Let me tell you about the beauties
of my culture! We love big trouble!

01:05:24.568 --> 01:05:27.878
That's what you say now! ln six months,
you'll be looking for the back door!

01:05:27.968 --> 01:05:31.881
Oh, no, it's never gonna be over
between you and me! You get it?

01:05:31.968 --> 01:05:34.562
Go back to your mother, Linda!
I'm finished!

01:05:34.608 --> 01:05:37.441
Tell her I made
a mistake. Do it!

01:05:37.488 --> 01:05:40.480
You hear me? Tell her
you made a mistake! Don't touch me!

01:05:40.568 --> 01:05:45.323
I don't want you here!
I don't want you! Get out! Go!

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:47.683
Leave me alone!

01:05:47.768 --> 01:05:49.724
Don't look at me
like that!

01:06:10.608 --> 01:06:12.997
Who is it? Who's there?

01:06:15.888 --> 01:06:19.164
Who is it?

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:21.085
Who's there?

01:06:29.288 --> 01:06:32.997
Hi. I thought
l'd improve the view.

01:06:33.088 --> 01:06:36.000
Oh, look at
the big kung fu man.

01:06:36.048 --> 01:06:40.007
- First sign of trouble
and all he does is quit.
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:06:43.048 --> 01:06:46.802
See this notebook? Looks like the
ones we had in school, right?

01:06:46.888 --> 01:06:49.277
Wrong.
This is your future.

01:06:49.328 --> 01:06:53.003
- I don't have any more future.
- Sure, you do.

01:06:53.088 --> 01:06:56.763
You know, all I keep hearing
is the fight took too long.

01:06:56.808 --> 01:06:59.322
Too much tradition,
too much classical mess...

01:06:59.368 --> 01:07:01.928
too many fixed positions
in wing chun.

01:07:02.008 --> 01:07:04.920
You know everything
that's wrong, so fix it.

01:07:04.968 --> 01:07:07.402
Stop whining
and start fighting.

01:07:07.488 --> 01:07:09.524
Fight back
with your mind.

01:07:09.608 --> 01:07:14.318
- I can't write, I can't move!
- You talk, quitter. l'll write.

01:07:21.288 --> 01:07:25.600
- I'm waiting.
- lt would take forever.

01:07:25.648 --> 01:07:28.481
You goin' anywhere?

01:07:29.968 --> 01:07:33.597
I'm not.

01:07:33.648 --> 01:07:37.766
Oh, yeah, there's
just one more thing.

01:07:39.248 --> 01:07:42.081
I'm pregnant.

01:07:46.648 --> 01:07:51.358
The great mistake is to anticipate
the outcome of the engagement.

01:07:51.448 --> 01:07:53.279
You ought not
to be thinking...

01:07:53.368 --> 01:07:57.122
of whether it ends
in victory or defeat;

01:07:57.168 --> 01:08:00.240
but let nature
take its course...

01:08:00.328 --> 01:08:04.799
and your tools will strike
at the right moment.

01:08:04.848 --> 01:08:08.158
The consciousness of self
is the greatest hindrance...

01:08:08.208 --> 01:08:10.085
to the proper execution
of all--

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:12.483
The knowledge and skill you have
achieved are meant to be forgotten.

01:08:12.568 --> 01:08:15.366
So you can float-- To obtain
enlightenment in martial art...

01:08:15.448 --> 01:08:17.484
means the extinction
of everything which--

01:08:17.568 --> 01:08:21.765
The way to transcend karma lies in
the proper use of the mind and the will.

01:08:21.808 --> 01:08:23.685
Jeet Kune Do
is not to hurt...

01:08:23.768 --> 01:08:26.885
but is one of the avenues through which
life opens its secrets to us.

01:08:26.968 --> 01:08:29.765
Relaxation
is essential...

01:08:29.848 --> 01:08:33.443
for faster and
more powerful punching.

01:08:33.528 --> 01:08:36.917
Let your lead punch
shoot up loosely and ea--

01:08:36.968 --> 01:08:39.277
An-And what? " Loosely and" what?

01:08:39.368 --> 01:08:42.644
- Loosely and easily!
-" Easily." Okay.

01:08:42.728 --> 01:08:45.925
Do not tighten up
or clench your fists...

01:08:45.968 --> 01:08:48.801
until the moment
of impact.

01:08:48.848 --> 01:08:50.725
- Aah! Aah.
- Okay, come on. Come on.

01:08:50.768 --> 01:08:54.044
All punches should end
with a snap several inches...

01:08:54.087 --> 01:08:56.807
- behind the target.
- Okay.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:01.198
Morning, ladies!

01:09:01.287 --> 01:09:04.724
- Congratulations, Mr. Lee.
- Thank you.

01:09:44.328 --> 01:09:46.398
Hey, kiddo.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:49.439
He's too young
to shave.

01:09:49.488 --> 01:09:53.447
They aren't shaving mirrors.
They're called pat kwa.

01:09:53.528 --> 01:09:56.679
Pat kwa?

01:09:56.768 --> 01:09:58.884
They're like gargoyles
on churches.

01:09:58.968 --> 01:10:02.722
You put them around
to ward off evil spirits.

01:10:06.448 --> 01:10:10.236
- I wanna call him Brandon.
- Brandon.

01:10:10.328 --> 01:10:12.319
That's good.

01:10:12.368 --> 01:10:14.677
Do you wanna hold him?

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:49.241
- Oh, look at Daddy.
- Hey, big guy.

01:10:49.288 --> 01:10:52.644
Come on up here. Shh!

01:10:54.808 --> 01:10:58.084
- He's so tiny.
- Hi, baby.

01:10:58.128 --> 01:11:01.120
- Don't be afraid.
- He's so tiny.

01:11:02.568 --> 01:11:04.923
You're beautiful.

01:11:11.528 --> 01:11:14.884
- Bruce? Bruce,
come here! lt came!
- Yeah?

01:11:14.928 --> 01:11:17.158
Look! lt's here,
it's here, it's here!

01:11:17.248 --> 01:11:20.001
- Oh.
- Open it! Open it up quick!

01:11:25.288 --> 01:11:27.119
Whoa!

01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:29.768
lt's your book!
lt's your book.

01:11:29.848 --> 01:11:33.443
Look at that.

01:11:36.608 --> 01:11:39.406
Okay, hold on.
l'll get it.

01:11:49.528 --> 01:11:53.282
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:53.368 --> 01:11:57.361
- May I come in?
- Why?

01:11:57.448 --> 01:12:01.327
- I like your hair.
- Come on, Mom, I don't
wanna chitchat with you.

01:12:01.408 --> 01:12:04.639
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you and--

01:12:04.688 --> 01:12:07.043
Did you come
to see me...

01:12:07.088 --> 01:12:10.763
or did you come to see
the yellow baby?

01:12:10.848 --> 01:12:14.557
- I think maybe I made a mistake.
- Brandon, it's Grandma!

01:12:14.608 --> 01:12:18.123
Grandma's come to see you!
Come on in, Grandma!

01:12:19.288 --> 01:12:21.961
There's someone
you ought to meet.

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:26.885
Come on.

01:12:33.728 --> 01:12:35.719
How are you feeling,
Mr. Lee?

01:12:35.808 --> 01:12:39.562
- Oh, like half-man, half-car.
- Glad to hear it.

01:12:43.128 --> 01:12:46.962
Linda, your mom's got great legs.
Great legs!

01:12:54.528 --> 01:12:56.837
He looks--

01:12:59.048 --> 01:13:02.404
Well, he-- He looks
like both of you.

01:13:04.688 --> 01:13:06.963
May l?

01:13:28.008 --> 01:13:31.478
Oh, come on,
sweetheart.

01:13:31.528 --> 01:13:33.917
There you go.

01:13:33.968 --> 01:13:36.801
Hello. Yes.

01:13:36.848 --> 01:13:40.636
You're such
a handsome fella.

01:13:40.688 --> 01:13:42.679
He's gorgeous.

01:13:49.368 --> 01:13:51.802
He's so sweet.

01:13:51.848 --> 01:13:53.839
Oh, yes, you are.

01:13:58.728 --> 01:14:00.719
You did good,
sweetheart.

01:14:00.808 --> 01:14:04.164
You sure did good.
Gosh, yes.

01:14:04.208 --> 01:14:06.403
Look at you!

01:14:06.488 --> 01:14:11.198
Brandon, you're a strong one.
Only you could do this.

01:14:28.848 --> 01:14:32.238
The art of Jeet Kune Do
is simply to simplify.

01:14:32.328 --> 01:14:36.207
lt favors formlessness so that
it can assume all forms.

01:14:36.288 --> 01:14:39.360
Kung Fu, karate,
tae kwan do.

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:41.922
All the classical styles
are attempts...

01:14:42.008 --> 01:14:44.283
to arrest
the flux of conflict.

01:14:44.328 --> 01:14:47.798
But in actual combat, the opponent
doesn't wait for formalities.

01:14:47.848 --> 01:14:50.885
He's not a robot, but a human
being, fluid and alive.

01:14:55.208 --> 01:14:58.245
For instance--
For instance!

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:01.718
Like a sculptor who doesn't
keep adding clay to a statue...

01:15:01.768 --> 01:15:04.805
but strips away the inessentials
until the truth is revealed.

01:15:04.888 --> 01:15:08.164
I have developed a way of fighting
with no fixed positions...

01:15:08.248 --> 01:15:10.079
with no set movements.

01:15:18.448 --> 01:15:20.837
The fancy mess
of martial arts...

01:15:20.928 --> 01:15:23.362
solidifies
what was once fluid.

01:15:23.408 --> 01:15:27.367
lt is nothing but blind devotion
to the systematic uselessness...

01:15:27.408 --> 01:15:29.968
of routines
that lead nowhere.

01:15:30.048 --> 01:15:34.166
Calm down!

01:15:38.888 --> 01:15:41.925
Calm down! Calm down!

01:15:41.968 --> 01:15:44.323
- Tell him to prove it!
- Yeah!

01:15:44.408 --> 01:15:46.239
Tell him
to prove it!

01:15:46.328 --> 01:15:49.923
Mr. Lee is not here
for competition.

01:15:50.008 --> 01:15:51.964
Prove it! Prove it!

01:15:52.008 --> 01:15:54.317
- Prove it! Prove it!
- All right, calm down, calm down!

01:15:54.408 --> 01:15:57.718
- Keep it quiet! Mr. Lee--
- Prove it! Prove it!

01:15:57.768 --> 01:16:00.601
- Prove it! Prove it!
- Okay!

01:16:00.648 --> 01:16:02.639
Okay, l'll prove it.

01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:07.720
l'll need someone
to prove it on.

01:16:11.088 --> 01:16:13.363
l'll beat any man
in this room in 60 seconds!

01:16:13.448 --> 01:16:15.359
What?

01:16:18.728 --> 01:16:21.083
l'll fight him!

01:16:25.608 --> 01:16:29.078
I beat him before!

01:16:29.128 --> 01:16:32.438
I beat him again!

01:16:48.328 --> 01:16:51.365
What are you, crazy?
The doctor said no more fighting.

01:16:51.448 --> 01:16:53.916
They told me l'd
never walk again, too.

01:16:53.968 --> 01:16:57.119
When will you be happy?
When they're right?

01:16:57.168 --> 01:16:59.398
Bruce, I'm begging you.
lf you love me--

01:16:59.488 --> 01:17:02.161
- This isn't about you and me.
- Fine!

01:17:02.248 --> 01:17:05.718
But I'm not going through this again,
do you understand me?

01:17:05.768 --> 01:17:08.077
You get hurt,
you're on your own.

01:17:10.128 --> 01:17:12.961
Don't go
too far, hon!

01:17:13.048 --> 01:17:16.324
lt'll be over
in sixty seconds.

01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:52.280
This is
a challenge match...

01:17:52.328 --> 01:17:56.606
to prove Mr. Lee's theories
on Jeet Kune Do.

01:17:56.648 --> 01:17:59.321
Sixty seconds.

01:18:04.248 --> 01:18:06.682
Bow to the judges.

01:18:13.488 --> 01:18:16.321
Bow to each other.

01:18:20.088 --> 01:18:22.079
Begin!

01:20:21.328 --> 01:20:23.205
Jesus Christ!

01:21:00.808 --> 01:21:04.118
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!

01:21:04.168 --> 01:21:08.161
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!

01:21:08.248 --> 01:21:09.966
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!

01:21:12.048 --> 01:21:15.961
- Yeah!
- Hey, Mr. Lee!

01:21:17.768 --> 01:21:20.965
Bill Krieger's the name. You looked
pretty great out there today.

01:21:21.048 --> 01:21:25.121
No, he didn't. He was too slow.
He took too long.

01:21:25.208 --> 01:21:27.563
You looked pretty fast to me.

01:21:27.648 --> 01:21:30.367
You think you can do some of
that stuff in front of a camera?

01:21:30.408 --> 01:21:34.640
- I'm a TV producer and--
- Right, and I'm Marvin Gaye.

01:21:34.728 --> 01:21:38.357
I'm casting my new series.
lt's called The Green Hornet...

01:21:38.408 --> 01:21:41.320
and I think
we could use you.

01:21:53.768 --> 01:21:56.646
So, d'you hear I bought
a house on the beach?

01:21:56.688 --> 01:21:58.565
Right in Malibu.
I'm tellin' ya...

01:21:58.608 --> 01:22:01.441
I got 120 yards of sand
as my front yard.

01:22:01.488 --> 01:22:05.242
Th-That's too tight. I can
sell the stunt. You don't have
to cut off the circulation.

01:22:05.288 --> 01:22:07.324
Cal, run him
through the scene.

01:22:07.368 --> 01:22:11.566
As soon as you get your cue light,
you come through that door.

01:22:11.648 --> 01:22:14.446
Then you work your way
down this catwalk here.

01:22:14.528 --> 01:22:17.247
Be real careful as
you negotiate this corner.

01:22:17.288 --> 01:22:20.280
I want you to get down these steps
as fast as you can.

01:22:20.328 --> 01:22:22.239
Not too fast.

01:22:22.328 --> 01:22:25.445
I don't want you to tumble. I don't
want to lose you on the first show.

01:22:25.488 --> 01:22:27.365
When you get
to this landing...

01:22:27.408 --> 01:22:30.047
do you think you could take
these five steps all at once?

01:22:30.088 --> 01:22:31.965
- l'll try.
- Atta boy.

01:22:32.008 --> 01:22:34.602
First positions, everybody!

01:22:34.688 --> 01:22:37.043
Hey, can you tell
it's me?

01:22:38.568 --> 01:22:41.401
I just talked to the network.
They love the dailies. They love 'em.

01:22:41.448 --> 01:22:44.167
- Don't they always?
- Yeah. Listen, there's, uh--

01:22:44.248 --> 01:22:48.241
- There's one small problem.
- Lemme call you back.

01:22:48.328 --> 01:22:52.321
- Yeah, what is it?
- Uh, it's this guy Lee.

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:55.360
You know, he's
awfully... Oriental.

01:22:55.408 --> 01:22:57.558
- He's supposed to be Oriental.
- Yeah.

01:22:57.608 --> 01:22:59.997
- He's playing an Oriental.
- I know, I know. What?

01:23:00.048 --> 01:23:02.642
- Kato is Oriental.
- I know, I know.

01:23:02.728 --> 01:23:05.720
Uh, can you just make sure
he keeps the mask on?

01:23:05.768 --> 01:23:09.283
Roll sound!
Roll camera!

01:23:09.368 --> 01:23:12.804
And mark it!

01:23:14.728 --> 01:23:17.686
- Action!
- All right, Green Hornet...

01:23:17.768 --> 01:23:19.838
where's
the secret formula?

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:25.048
- Where it belongs.
- Okay, have it your way.

01:23:37.368 --> 01:23:39.165
Kato!

01:23:48.008 --> 01:23:50.238
Good work, Kato!

01:23:50.328 --> 01:23:53.286
Good work, Kato!

01:23:53.368 --> 01:23:55.643
Ow! Ow!

01:23:57.128 --> 01:23:59.596
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:24:03.768 --> 01:24:06.566
- Good work, Kato.
- Thanks, boss.

01:24:09.928 --> 01:24:14.399
Huh? Ah, cut, cut, cut!

01:24:14.448 --> 01:24:16.643
That's a print.

01:24:16.688 --> 01:24:19.646
Thought that'd be
a little more exciting.

01:24:22.608 --> 01:24:25.361
lf he came from Hong Kong,
he'd end up in San Francisco.

01:24:25.448 --> 01:24:28.246
- I don't wanna do the urban thing.
- We helped with the railroads.

01:24:28.328 --> 01:24:31.206
- How about the Wild West?
- Okay, great. The Wild West.

01:24:31.288 --> 01:24:33.438
- Okay.
- Chinese immigrant wanders the land.

01:24:33.528 --> 01:24:36.759
- He's a good guy, a hero.
- Of course, he's a hero.
He's the star of the show.

01:24:36.808 --> 01:24:38.685
He wanders the land
solving problems.

01:24:38.728 --> 01:24:41.925
- Every week he solves a problem.
- With no gun. Just his hands.

01:24:42.008 --> 01:24:43.919
That's good.
That's great. No gun.

01:24:44.008 --> 01:24:47.398
- He's looking for something.
- His father. He lost his father
who came ahead of him.

01:24:47.488 --> 01:24:50.844
No, no, not the father. The father
thing has been done to death.

01:24:50.888 --> 01:24:52.765
- He's searching for his brother.
- Good.

01:24:52.808 --> 01:24:54.685
- Searching for his brother.
- He never finds him.

01:24:54.728 --> 01:24:58.403
- Not until the fifth year.
- He wanders the land,
searching for his brother...

01:24:58.488 --> 01:25:02.117
- solving problems with no gun.
- And he has something
no one else has ever seen.

01:25:02.208 --> 01:25:04.768
- Kung Fu! Starring Bruce Lee.
- Kung Fu! Uh-huh.

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:07.845
He remembers what he was taught
in the old country by his teacher...

01:25:07.928 --> 01:25:09.759
and teaches people
his culture.

01:25:09.848 --> 01:25:12.646
After he's kicked the shit
out of everybody. Fantastic!

01:25:12.728 --> 01:25:15.959
- We've got action, culture!
lt's a western!
- But it's an Eastern.

01:25:16.008 --> 01:25:18.238
lt's an Eastern.
Right. lt's an Eastern.

01:25:18.288 --> 01:25:20.756
They're gonna love it.
This thing's gonna run forever!

01:25:20.808 --> 01:25:22.685
- Kung Fu!
- Kung Fu!

01:25:23.928 --> 01:25:25.407
Easy, easy.

01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:37.199
Wow.

01:25:37.288 --> 01:25:40.564
- You steal Steve McQueen's car?
- He stole mine.

01:25:40.648 --> 01:25:43.037
- Come on, get in. We're late.
- Okay.

01:25:43.128 --> 01:25:45.403
What? Linda. Hey.

01:25:45.448 --> 01:25:48.645
-l--
-You do the clutch, l'll work the stick.

01:26:24.488 --> 01:26:26.399
Bruce! Linda!

01:26:26.448 --> 01:26:30.077
- So glad you guys could make it.
Go on in. We'll be right down.
- Okay.

01:26:30.128 --> 01:26:32.323
This way, please.

01:26:50.728 --> 01:26:54.118
Excuse me, Mr. Krieger,
there's a phone call.

01:26:54.208 --> 01:26:56.164
Excuse me.

01:26:58.728 --> 01:27:01.561
Did I ever tell you I was
the cha-cha champion of Hong Kong?

01:27:01.608 --> 01:27:04.327
About 15,000 times.

01:27:04.368 --> 01:27:08.122
- Did I ever tell you I was pregnant?
- Once.

01:27:08.168 --> 01:27:11.524
Make that twice.

01:27:16.528 --> 01:27:19.326
Hold it, everybody!
Hold it!

01:27:19.488 --> 01:27:23.447
Hold it!

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:26.321
I know the timing
is lousy, but, uh...

01:27:26.368 --> 01:27:29.201
I wanted you to hear it
first from me personally.

01:27:29.248 --> 01:27:31.682
The show's been cancelled.

01:27:31.768 --> 01:27:33.599
- What?
- Oh, no.

01:27:33.688 --> 01:27:36.805
I know it's a bummer, but we'll
finish out the last episodes...

01:27:36.888 --> 01:27:39.800
and, uh, that'll be that.

01:27:39.888 --> 01:27:42.527
I'm sorry.

01:27:42.608 --> 01:27:45.486
Enjoy the rest of the party.

01:27:47.608 --> 01:27:51.647
Bill and I will just roll
into Kung Fu!

01:27:51.688 --> 01:27:53.963
1, 2, cha-cha-cha.

01:27:54.048 --> 01:27:56.846
1, 2, cha-cha-cha.
1 and 2 and 3 and 4...

01:27:56.928 --> 01:28:00.204
and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4.
1, 2, cha-cha-cha.

01:28:00.288 --> 01:28:03.325
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:28:03.408 --> 01:28:07.640
So what are they saying at
the network about Kung Fu?

01:28:07.728 --> 01:28:10.242
Right.

01:28:10.328 --> 01:28:12.523
And when do you think
they'll know?

01:28:12.608 --> 01:28:16.521
Oh, Bill, Bill, Bill.
What about dinner?

01:28:16.608 --> 01:28:18.678
Call me back.

01:28:29.088 --> 01:28:32.603
They still haven't made
any decisions on the show.

01:28:32.688 --> 01:28:35.646
- Still looks good.
- Good.

01:28:35.688 --> 01:28:37.963
Don't worry.

01:28:38.048 --> 01:28:40.608
Who else are they gonna get,
Mickey Rooney?

01:28:40.688 --> 01:28:42.679
I'm not worried.

01:28:44.288 --> 01:28:46.597
I'm not worried.

01:29:30.568 --> 01:29:32.445
Hello?

01:29:34.688 --> 01:29:37.521
- Really?
- As quickly as you can...

01:29:37.568 --> 01:29:39.957
snatch the pebble
from my hand.

01:29:40.248 --> 01:29:41.886
All right.

01:29:44.448 --> 01:29:47.838
- Okay.
- When you can take
the pebble from my hand...

01:29:47.928 --> 01:29:50.158
it will be time
for you to leave.

01:29:51.688 --> 01:29:54.077
What's wrong, honey?

01:29:56.768 --> 01:29:59.566
My father's dead.

01:31:08.328 --> 01:31:11.161
- lt comes, it goes.
- ln your dream?

01:31:11.208 --> 01:31:14.757
No, I'm always awake.
lt's not a dream, sifu.

01:31:14.848 --> 01:31:18.284
When your father first brought
you here, he told me everything.

01:31:18.368 --> 01:31:20.518
He wanted you to learn
wing chun...

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:23.168
to protect yourself
against man...

01:31:23.208 --> 01:31:25.722
- and other forces.
- I thought that was all superstition.

01:31:25.768 --> 01:31:31.001
Superstition is a name the ignorant
give to their ignorance.

01:31:31.048 --> 01:31:34.040
You were special then,
and you're special now.

01:31:34.088 --> 01:31:36.761
That's why the demon
wants you.

01:31:39.008 --> 01:31:42.637
We have spent a lot of time together,
preparing you for this.

01:31:47.128 --> 01:31:49.323
Good. Good.

01:31:49.408 --> 01:31:51.717
Very good.

01:31:54.088 --> 01:31:57.239
What if I won't fight him?

01:31:57.288 --> 01:31:59.165
You have no choice.

01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:03.759
-You're fighting for more than yourself.
-What are you saying, sifu?

01:32:03.808 --> 01:32:07.801
As I told you, this demon
is your inner fear.

01:32:07.848 --> 01:32:11.124
lt doesn't matter
how many men you defeat.

01:32:11.168 --> 01:32:13.557
lf you don't conquer
your own fears...

01:32:13.608 --> 01:32:16.168
you will pass your demons
on to your children...

01:32:16.248 --> 01:32:19.399
as your father passed his
on to you.

01:32:21.728 --> 01:32:23.605
No.

01:32:23.648 --> 01:32:25.525
You will fight him.

01:32:30.448 --> 01:32:33.246
When you are
at your absolute peak...

01:32:33.288 --> 01:32:35.483
he will come to you.

01:32:35.528 --> 01:32:38.838
When the monsoon blow,
be prepared.

01:33:45.728 --> 01:33:48.959
Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee!

01:33:49.048 --> 01:33:51.687
l've been chasing you
all over Hong Kong.

01:33:51.768 --> 01:33:53.804
You should buy a car.

01:33:53.888 --> 01:33:57.563
- Just a joke.
- I'm Philip Tan.

01:33:57.648 --> 01:34:00.208
I'm a producer. I want to
make a picture with you.

01:34:00.288 --> 01:34:03.280
- Talk is cheap. Pictures are expensive.
- I'm on the level.

01:34:03.328 --> 01:34:05.398
You're Kato,
and over here...

01:34:05.488 --> 01:34:08.446
Kato has a small
but loyal following.

01:34:08.528 --> 01:34:10.405
Something we can build on.

01:34:10.488 --> 01:34:13.719
They don't call your show The Green
Hornet. lt's called The Kato Show.

01:34:13.808 --> 01:34:16.766
Did you know that?
Well, it's true.

01:34:16.808 --> 01:34:20.084
When I hear Kato is in town,
I consider it a good omen.

01:34:20.128 --> 01:34:23.245
- l've got to get back to my family.
- Leave tomorrow. Give us time.

01:34:23.328 --> 01:34:26.604
-l've been away for so long.
-l'll buy you a new ticket, first class.

01:34:26.688 --> 01:34:29.521
l'll take care of everything.
One more day, please.

01:34:29.568 --> 01:34:32.128
You can't lose.

01:34:32.168 --> 01:34:34.045
What's the movie?

01:34:57.888 --> 01:35:00.277
Action! Action!

01:35:00.368 --> 01:35:02.836
Action!

01:35:25.608 --> 01:35:27.564
My brother can't talk right.

01:35:27.648 --> 01:35:29.479
He can't walk right.

01:35:29.568 --> 01:35:31.798
You have dishonored
my family.

01:35:31.848 --> 01:35:33.725
- I have sworn to kill you.
- Swearing is easy.

01:35:37.248 --> 01:35:41.526
I read your book.
I know all your tricks.

01:35:41.568 --> 01:35:44.128
Let's see how well you've
learned your lesson.

01:39:37.928 --> 01:39:42.479
lt's so hot in here, I like
to put my dolly in the refrigerator.

01:39:42.528 --> 01:39:44.519
Yeah, that was fun!

01:39:44.608 --> 01:39:46.644
- We missed you!
- I missed you too!

01:39:46.688 --> 01:39:48.644
- I missed you.
- I missed you!

01:40:46.968 --> 01:40:48.924
Hurry up! Over there!

01:40:51.968 --> 01:40:54.562
Listen, Cheng, give up.

01:40:56.968 --> 01:40:59.243
Cheng!

01:40:59.328 --> 01:41:01.159
Ohh!

01:41:04.528 --> 01:41:06.359
lt's okay, Mei.

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:30.321
Let's get out of here
before they lynch us.

01:42:06.608 --> 01:42:09.486
Yeah! Hey!

01:42:09.568 --> 01:42:12.765
Bruce!

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:50.367
Bruce!

01:42:50.408 --> 01:42:52.524
Linda!

01:42:52.608 --> 01:42:54.439
Bruce!

01:42:56.448 --> 01:42:59.008
Bruce!

01:44:14.528 --> 01:44:16.439
Daddy's taking me
to the circus!

01:44:16.488 --> 01:44:18.956
Oh, my.

01:44:19.008 --> 01:44:22.045
- Okay, Brandon, go change.
Don't keep Daddy waiting.
- Okay!

01:44:31.208 --> 01:44:33.676
Okay, back! Back!
Number two. Number two.

01:44:37.248 --> 01:44:39.478
lt's okay.

01:44:39.528 --> 01:44:41.962
Come on, big boy.

01:44:42.048 --> 01:44:44.004
Come on.

01:44:44.088 --> 01:44:48.604
Your bed is so much more cozy.
Come on.

01:44:48.688 --> 01:44:51.122
We'll go up to your bed with
the covers and everything.

01:45:13.568 --> 01:45:17.766
Somewhere there's gotta be
a series in all this.

01:45:21.768 --> 01:45:25.647
Three minutes.
lt's like doing 200 pushups.

01:45:29.328 --> 01:45:31.205
- Wanna try?
- Uh, no thanks.

01:45:31.288 --> 01:45:34.883
- You might turn it up
and try to electrocute me.
- The thought crossed my mind.

01:45:34.968 --> 01:45:37.562
Justifiable homicide,
some might say.

01:45:37.608 --> 01:45:40.520
What do you want, Bill?

01:45:40.608 --> 01:45:44.840
- You didn't come here
to discuss old times.
- I came to discuss new times.

01:45:44.928 --> 01:45:48.921
There's somebody I want you to meet.
His name is Freddie Weintraub.

01:45:49.008 --> 01:45:50.839
We've got a project for you.

01:45:50.928 --> 01:45:53.601
What's the matter,
David Carradine turn you down?

01:45:53.688 --> 01:45:57.283
No, Fred's got a script.
lt's called Enter The Dragon.

01:45:57.368 --> 01:46:00.166
We're gonna shoot it here,
but it's your ticket back to America.

01:46:00.248 --> 01:46:03.001
lt's a feature.

01:46:03.048 --> 01:46:05.039
A Hollywood feature.

01:46:05.088 --> 01:46:08.000
With all the trimmings.
Hmm?

01:46:08.088 --> 01:46:10.966
Hey!

01:46:41.128 --> 01:46:43.005
Ohh.

01:46:43.048 --> 01:46:45.118
lt's okay.

01:46:45.208 --> 01:46:47.039
I'm awake.

01:46:48.328 --> 01:46:50.603
I was working
on Game Of Death.

01:46:50.688 --> 01:46:52.519
Lost track of time.

01:46:54.128 --> 01:46:57.086
The kids okay?

01:46:57.168 --> 01:47:01.081
Don't you ever get tired
of asking that question?

01:47:01.128 --> 01:47:03.722
Linda, we've been
through this before.

01:47:03.808 --> 01:47:06.561
I don't have a choice.

01:47:06.648 --> 01:47:09.208
You might not...

01:47:09.248 --> 01:47:11.443
but I do.

01:47:11.488 --> 01:47:14.798
I'm taking the kids
and going home for a while.

01:47:14.848 --> 01:47:19.205
- Home's here for now.
- No. Here is where we watch you work.

01:47:19.288 --> 01:47:23.201
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to come with us.

01:47:23.288 --> 01:47:26.325
Forget it.

01:47:26.368 --> 01:47:29.201
I worked in America for ten years
and what did it get me?

01:47:29.248 --> 01:47:33.036
- lt got me nothing.
- lt got you me.

01:47:33.088 --> 01:47:35.727
Oh, man.

01:47:35.808 --> 01:47:38.561
They got such
a good line of bullshit.

01:47:38.648 --> 01:47:41.446
"Come and get it!"
"America, the mountain of gold!"

01:47:41.528 --> 01:47:43.962
"lt's for everybody!"
Yeah, it's for everybody white!

01:47:44.008 --> 01:47:47.637
But they don't tell you that!
You gotta read the small print!

01:47:47.688 --> 01:47:49.565
lf you can read.

01:47:50.888 --> 01:47:53.083
I am not America.

01:47:53.168 --> 01:47:56.683
Your kids are not America.
Don't push us away.

01:47:59.968 --> 01:48:02.721
We're going.

01:48:02.808 --> 01:48:05.117
I want you
to come with us.

01:48:08.368 --> 01:48:11.519
I want the kids
to have a father again.

01:48:11.608 --> 01:48:13.724
Don't lay any
guilt trips on me!

01:48:13.768 --> 01:48:17.556
- I'm not taking any guilt trips!
- This place is eating us up!

01:48:17.648 --> 01:48:21.357
- Can't you see that, Bruce?
- This place has given us a life!

01:48:21.408 --> 01:48:23.842
I'm somebody here!
I'm special!

01:48:23.928 --> 01:48:25.998
Back there,
I'm just another gook!

01:48:26.048 --> 01:48:30.007
Just another wetback, Charlie Chan,
slopehead, coolie dishwasher...

01:48:30.048 --> 01:48:32.164
in a stinking Chinkie
restaurant!

01:48:32.248 --> 01:48:33.886
Mom!

01:48:33.928 --> 01:48:35.964
Wash your shirt, Mister White Man?

01:48:36.008 --> 01:48:38.647
Please?
No tickee, no shirtee!

01:48:38.688 --> 01:48:42.237
- Order one from column " A"
and one from column " B."
- Mommy!

01:48:42.328 --> 01:48:44.159
Me happy to build
the railroads...

01:48:44.248 --> 01:48:46.716
to dig the mines for you,
Mister White Man!

01:48:48.728 --> 01:48:51.959
- Mommy, I'm scared! What's happening?
- ls that who I am?

01:48:52.008 --> 01:48:54.966
ls it? Tell me!
Tell me that's who I am!

01:48:55.008 --> 01:48:58.318
I don't know who the hell
you are anymore!

01:48:59.968 --> 01:49:02.687
- Do you?
- Mommy, what's happening?

01:49:21.888 --> 01:49:25.244
Weintraub's script is called Enter
The Dragon. I read it. lt's really good.

01:49:25.328 --> 01:49:28.798
- I thought we were partners.
I made you my partner!
- We are partners!

01:49:28.888 --> 01:49:30.719
I told him without you,
no deal.

01:49:30.808 --> 01:49:32.958
"A Co-production ln Association
With Philip Tan" ?

01:49:33.048 --> 01:49:35.516
- That's an insult!
- You could get more.

01:49:35.608 --> 01:49:38.680
- lt's not about getting more.
We don't need them!
- Yes, we do.

01:49:38.728 --> 01:49:41.959
lt's Warner Brothers,
big budget, in English, with
international distribution!

01:49:42.048 --> 01:49:45.085
Don't sell me, Bruce!
Don't sell a salesman!

01:49:52.488 --> 01:49:55.048
Do you have an aspirin?

01:50:11.888 --> 01:50:15.483
I don't know, man. I don't know
how much longer I can keep this up.

01:50:19.568 --> 01:50:22.560
You want it so bad,
don't you?

01:50:22.648 --> 01:50:24.878
You want their love so bad.

01:50:24.928 --> 01:50:26.805
Our love's
not good enough for you.

01:50:26.848 --> 01:50:30.557
When I was a kid,
I had all these crazy ideas.

01:50:32.248 --> 01:50:36.639
I wanted to show the world the beauty
of our culture, to give them a hero.

01:50:36.728 --> 01:50:39.481
- But a Chinese hero.
- You have.

01:50:39.528 --> 01:50:41.405
Don't you see that?

01:50:44.448 --> 01:50:46.564
I want something else now.

01:50:48.608 --> 01:50:51.839
I want to stop breaking
my wife's heart.

01:50:51.928 --> 01:50:55.204
I want to play with my children
without having to look at the clock.

01:50:58.328 --> 01:51:00.284
They're American.

01:51:01.768 --> 01:51:04.601
I need to get back to America
or l'll lose them.

01:51:09.688 --> 01:51:12.441
lf I lose them,
nothing means anything.

01:53:36.928 --> 01:53:38.725
Look!

01:53:41.808 --> 01:53:43.844
No.

01:53:43.928 --> 01:53:48.285
No!

01:53:48.328 --> 01:53:51.684
Nooo!

01:53:51.768 --> 01:53:54.236
Nooooooo!

01:53:56.768 --> 01:53:58.998
Daddy! Dad!

01:53:59.088 --> 01:54:04.481
- Dad, come home! Dad!
- Brandon, run!

01:54:04.568 --> 01:54:08.447
- Run, Brandon! Run, Brandon! Go!
- Dad! Come on, Dad!

01:54:08.488 --> 01:54:11.366
Brandon, run!

01:54:11.448 --> 01:54:14.008
- Aaah!
- Dad?

01:54:14.048 --> 01:54:18.678
Dad! Dad, he's coming! Dad!

01:54:20.168 --> 01:54:24.081
Come on, Dad!
Dad, he's coming!

01:54:29.008 --> 01:54:31.158
Dad!

01:54:37.248 --> 01:54:39.637
lt's okay, Brandon!
lt's okay!

01:54:42.568 --> 01:54:45.287
Dad!

01:54:46.088 --> 01:54:48.886
Now, Brandon, now!
Now! Run!

01:55:35.008 --> 01:55:38.080
Kind of lost you there
for a minute, bud. You okay?

01:55:43.128 --> 01:55:45.005
Bruce? You all right?

01:55:45.048 --> 01:55:46.959
You all right?

01:56:01.688 --> 01:56:03.679
Dad! What are you
doing here?

01:56:03.728 --> 01:56:06.879
I live here.

01:56:06.928 --> 01:56:09.488
- Hey, can I play with you guys?
- Sure.

01:56:09.528 --> 01:56:12.406
Daddy, we had a typhoon.

01:56:13.488 --> 01:56:15.319
I know.

01:56:16.728 --> 01:56:19.288
But it's over now.

01:56:19.368 --> 01:56:23.759
Okay, Dad, l'll be
the engineer, you be the switcher.

01:56:23.848 --> 01:56:26.123
Hey, that sounds great.

01:56:31.368 --> 01:56:33.962
Last shot.

01:56:34.008 --> 01:56:36.568
Make it great.

01:56:54.208 --> 01:56:57.006
- Linda, I forgot something.
- What?

01:56:58.328 --> 01:57:01.161
I forgot to tell you
I love you.

01:57:03.808 --> 01:57:06.880
You know, I don't think you've
ever said that to me before.

01:57:06.928 --> 01:57:09.761
Yeah, but I meant it
every day.

01:57:43.528 --> 01:57:46.326
Three weeks before
the opening of Enter the Dragon...

01:57:46.408 --> 01:57:48.638
the film that brought him
international fame...

01:57:48.688 --> 01:57:51.680
Bruce fell into
a mysterious coma and died.

01:57:51.728 --> 01:57:53.639
He was 32.

01:57:53.728 --> 01:57:57.482
Over 25,000 people attended
his funeral in Hong Kong...

01:57:57.568 --> 01:58:01.607
but I buried him back home
in America to be close to us.

01:58:01.648 --> 01:58:05.482
All these years later, people still
wonder about the way he died.

01:58:05.568 --> 01:58:08.366
I prefer to remember
the way he lived.
