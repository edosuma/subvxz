00:01.262 --> 00:02.785
[Kara] Previously on
Supergirl...

00:02.828 --> 00:05.179
-You kept the necklace.
-A reminder of you.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.964
[Sam] Reign was there,
in the dark valley.

00:08.008 --> 00:11.533
When your body transforms
into Reign, your mind
literally goes there.

00:11.576 --> 00:14.318
So, you think there's
an enzyme in my body
that triggers a change.

00:14.362 --> 00:16.277
If we can isolate it,
we can eliminate it.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.321
And no more Reign.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.193
[Alex] She's Pestilence.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.151
In 1,000 years
she evolves into Blight.

00:21.586 --> 00:22.805
I found you.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.503
Lena. What is this?

00:27.723 --> 00:28.724
[screeches]

00:30.030 --> 00:31.335
[Sam] She said
they were coming for us.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.033
Finally.

00:44.914 --> 00:46.437
[J'onn J'onzz]
Please state your name.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.744
[Lena]
Lena Keiran Luthor.

00:50.311 --> 00:51.747
Where should I begin?

00:51.790 --> 00:54.228
-How long has this been
going on?
-Three weeks.

00:54.271 --> 01:00.190
And what exactly have you
been doing with Sam for weeks?

01:01.887 --> 01:04.368
When I first suspected
that Sam was more than
she knew,

01:04.412 --> 01:07.458
I took her to a secret lab
in L-Corp, where I conducted
a series of tests.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.765
With her consent.

01:09.808 --> 01:12.550
When I examined her, I found
nothing out of the ordinary.

01:12.594 --> 01:13.986
Then you weren't looking
for the right things.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.205
So, what did you find?

01:16.946 --> 01:18.600
After sequencing her DNA,

01:18.643 --> 01:22.169
and comparing Sam's blackouts
to the Reign's attacks,

01:22.212 --> 01:26.173
I came to the conclusion that
Sam and Reign were one
and the same.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.262
Sam is Reign.

01:30.177 --> 01:31.569
So, for three weeks,

01:31.613 --> 01:33.571
you've been harboring
and abetting a mass murderer.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.138
[Lena] I helped a friend.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.444
And you didn't think
to bring this
to our attention?

01:36.487 --> 01:38.098
The attention of
a clandestine organization,

01:38.141 --> 01:40.404
that's never formally
acknowledged its existence
to me?

01:40.448 --> 01:42.450
No. I'm not your employee.

01:42.493 --> 01:46.106
I've not signed a contract,
nor sworn an oath.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.846
I conducted
an L-Corp experiment,

01:47.890 --> 01:50.153
using L-Corp technology
on L-Corp property.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.633
What did you discover?

01:54.157 --> 01:57.639
I was hoping to isolate
the spark that turned Sam
into Reign,

01:57.682 --> 02:00.120
but I didn't get a chance
to finish.

02:01.251 --> 02:03.166
Weeks with Reign.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.910
Do you have any way
of tracking the Worldkillers?

02:09.651 --> 02:10.652
No.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.132
Anyone else?

02:12.175 --> 02:13.655
They have gone to ground.

02:15.483 --> 02:16.788
They're not coming up again
until they have something big
to do.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.661
The future's fate is more
precarious than ever.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.621
Would you like to know our
odds of defeating Pestilence
at this juncture?

02:23.665 --> 02:25.145
-No.
-No.

02:26.668 --> 02:30.759
How did you keep her
contained?

02:34.676 --> 02:36.765
Lex kept a vault in the lab.

02:38.245 --> 02:41.596
When I took over L-Corp,
I inherited all of its assets,

02:41.639 --> 02:43.511
for good or for ill.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.036
I used Kryptonite.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.309
[Dark Kryptonian]
We are so close,
daughters.

02:59.353 --> 03:02.530
So close to a new
and clean realm.

03:04.314 --> 03:05.881
But before we can begin,

03:06.664 --> 03:10.625
the humanity within you
must shrivel and submit.

03:11.539 --> 03:14.063
You must be completely mine.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.198
[inhales] Mmm...

03:18.720 --> 03:20.330
I just felt it.

03:20.374 --> 03:23.768
Grace just shriveled
and gave up without a sound.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.335
My change is complete.

03:25.379 --> 03:28.208
And you are magnificent.

03:29.078 --> 03:32.603
Purity, Reign,
you will soon follow.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.607
Samantha and Julia
cannot last long now

03:36.651 --> 03:38.740
that you're all finally
together.

03:39.175 --> 03:43.397
You must all join and bring
a blessed darkness to Earth,

03:44.267 --> 03:46.226
so that it may be reborn.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.884
[gasping]

04:00.892 --> 04:02.633
Oh, Jesus.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.684
Who are you?

04:12.948 --> 04:14.166
I'm not gonna hurt you.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.429
[screams]

04:17.039 --> 04:18.040
I killed him.

04:19.433 --> 04:22.174
-I don't see anything.
-That's because he's mine.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.568
Not yours.

04:26.135 --> 04:28.311
But your kills will
come back soon.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.272
We're the same.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.536
Was she one of us, too?

04:37.451 --> 04:39.148
[Julia panting]

04:39.191 --> 04:43.021
He wants me. They're coming.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.634
They're all coming.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.378
Come on. We're not safe here.

04:52.770 --> 04:56.252
-There's nowhere to go.
-There is. Let's go. Come on.

05:05.914 --> 05:08.351
Okay. Georgia, I'm gonna
need you to go down
to the National City Hospital

05:08.395 --> 05:10.353
and get me a status update
on the mayor's condition.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.138
But I don't need propaganda
from his press secretary.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.227
I need facts
from the attending physician.

05:15.445 --> 05:17.534
-[cell phone ringing]
-Give me a second, guys.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.624
Lena Luthor calling me.
What's up?

05:21.364 --> 05:23.061
I really needed
to hear your voice.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.367
Everything okay?

05:24.411 --> 05:26.282
I owe you an apology.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.458
-What for?
-For ghosting you.

05:29.024 --> 05:32.984
For keeping secrets.
But it's time to be honest.

05:33.681 --> 05:34.682
About?

05:36.292 --> 05:37.554
Sam Arias is Reign.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.645
Supergirl knows, and so do
the appropriate authorities.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.212
So, when you were telling me
about your employee

05:43.255 --> 05:46.607
that couldn't accept
her problem...

05:46.650 --> 05:49.784
I was working to rid Sam
of Reign, to free her.

05:51.046 --> 05:54.615
But she put Supergirl
in a coma. How did you keep
her under control?

05:57.182 --> 05:58.749
The last of Lex's Kryptonite.

05:59.533 --> 06:03.537
And don't worry,
Supergirl knows about that,
too.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.496
And you're telling me
this now, why?

06:08.542 --> 06:11.414
Because I gambled everything.

06:11.458 --> 06:14.199
My reputation,
Supergirl's trust in me,

06:14.243 --> 06:17.377
my relationship with you,
on fixing Sam. And I failed.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.641
I really needed to hear
your voice today,

06:20.684 --> 06:24.253
and I didn't want you to look
at me like I was a Luthor.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.211
[Supergirl] Lena!

06:27.778 --> 06:30.564
I've had enough of that today.
I've, um... I've gotta go.

06:30.607 --> 06:31.652
Lena...

06:35.917 --> 06:38.136
I've had your back
so many times.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.487
When the rest of the world
was ready to pass you off

06:40.530 --> 06:41.923
as the new Lex Luthor.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.794
My friend came to me.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.362
She was alone and afraid.
I had to do something.

06:47.102 --> 06:51.802
I need you to level with me.
Do you have any more
Kryptonite?

06:51.846 --> 06:53.543
No, it's all gone.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.938
I used the last of it
to keep Sam sedate.

06:59.723 --> 07:02.117
[Supergirl groaning]

07:02.160 --> 07:03.335
[Lena] Supergirl?

07:06.121 --> 07:07.862
[breathing heavily]

07:18.829 --> 07:20.440
[gasps]

07:21.789 --> 07:23.486
Hey, what happened?

07:23.530 --> 07:25.183
I saw Sam.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.240
It has begun.

07:44.159 --> 07:46.204
[Lena] That eclipse
was like someone grabbed
on the moon and pulled.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.510
The Earth and the Moon
turn on an axis,

07:47.554 --> 07:48.859
and no amount of technology
can change that.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.513
That's because
this isn't technology.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.297
-You should be in the med bay.
-Fine.

07:52.341 --> 07:53.908
This is older than science.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.953
-Please don't say "magic."
-Dark magic.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.042
Reign, Purity, Pestilence,

07:58.086 --> 08:00.741
they were all created
by Kryptonian witches
to do one thing.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.874
Kill the world. And now that
they're together,
they're doing that.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.136
How do you know that?

08:05.180 --> 08:06.964
There's no apocalypse
in the Book of Rao,

08:07.008 --> 08:09.750
but there are parables
about witches joining hands

08:09.793 --> 08:11.795
to create a blessed darkness.

08:11.839 --> 08:14.929
So, whatever ritual
the Worldkillers are doing,
it's creating the eclipse.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.887
The world can't live
without sunlight.

08:16.931 --> 08:19.455
Nothing can,
including Supergirl.

08:20.456 --> 08:21.501
How long have we got?

08:21.892 --> 08:24.460
-Two hours until totality.
-Then what?

08:24.765 --> 08:26.506
Temperature drops 50 degrees,
maybe more.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.072
You said you dreamed of Sam.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.770
But people don't dream
during a seizure.

08:29.813 --> 08:32.816
It's the same dream
I've been having
for the last year.

08:33.382 --> 08:35.906
I'm in the Kryptonian valley,
Juru.

08:35.950 --> 08:39.127
Normally, I see
the Worldkillers,
but today, I saw Sam.

08:39.475 --> 08:43.087
You dreamt of Julia Freeman,
too. She turned out
to be real.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.263
Well, it's not a dream,
the valley's real.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.528
When I was working with Sam,
she told me of this place.

08:48.571 --> 08:51.313
It's an alternate dimension
that she would go to

08:51.356 --> 08:52.706
when Reign would take over.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.534
But how could Supergirl
see it?

08:54.577 --> 08:58.276
On Mars, my people would share
memories, emotions,
experiences...

08:59.103 --> 09:01.715
Sometimes, you would
experience a particularly
strong mind

09:01.758 --> 09:02.933
wholly by accident.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.066
Like picking up
a radio broadcast?

09:05.109 --> 09:09.940
But Supergirl just picked up
an alternate dimension.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.768
[Lena] It's possible.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.640
And if we could go in there,
maybe we could wake Sam up

09:13.683 --> 09:15.772
and she could send us
a message to say
where the Worldkillers are.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.600
There's still one big hole
in this plan.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.907
How do we send Supergirl
back to this valley?

09:22.039 --> 09:25.303
-We fight fantasy with sci-fi.
-[Brainy]
Let me get this straight.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.567
You want me to broadcast
your consciousness

09:27.610 --> 09:31.266
into a magical dark valley
dimension using
the 31st century technology,

09:31.309 --> 09:34.878
which allowed me to access
your mind when Reign
punched you into a coma.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.446
Technology specifically
designed to enter
human consciousness,

09:37.489 --> 09:39.448
not alternate realms.

09:39.491 --> 09:42.625
And you want me to do this
all before the solar eclipse
achieves totality,

09:42.669 --> 09:45.106
which will happen
in less than two hours.

09:45.149 --> 09:48.413
-Yes.
-Okay, no problem.

09:48.457 --> 09:51.025
Sounds fun.
To the Legion Cruiser.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.417
Let's do this.

09:54.985 --> 09:57.074
-I'm coming with you.
-Not a chance.

09:57.118 --> 10:00.034
-It might not even
be possible.
-Oh, no, it's possible.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.818
[Lena] Listen,
I spent the last month

10:01.862 --> 10:04.821
working with Sam and Reign,
every day.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.388
I know what makes them tick.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.782
I know their DNA sequence
better than my own
phone number.

10:09.086 --> 10:11.480
What's more, I know Sam,
and you don't.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.788
If anyone can get through
to her, it's me.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.747
I get that you may not
trust me right now,

10:18.008 --> 10:19.575
but trust that
I want to get Sam back.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.925
Sam's my friend, too.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.536
And with the sun darkening,
your powers are gonna weaken.

10:24.580 --> 10:28.540
You might not have any powers
in that valley-mind-realm
thing.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.847
You're gonna need somebody
to watch your backs.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.852
Well, I guess
we're all in this together.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.637
Strength in numbers.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.597
[Brainy] I need 50 minutes
to prepare.
[Alex] You sure about this?

10:41.815 --> 10:45.557
No, but Lena's right,
she's been working with Sam
for weeks.

10:45.993 --> 10:49.170
And having her with us
will give us a chance
to verify her story.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.389
[Sam] Hello?

10:56.307 --> 10:57.918
Hello?

11:00.964 --> 11:02.139
Hello!

11:02.183 --> 11:07.231
-No! [whimpering]
-What? What's going on?

11:07.275 --> 11:11.279
It's them.
All the people I killed.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.805
You're okay. We have to go.

11:15.849 --> 11:18.242
No, no, no. I killed them.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.070
I killed them.

11:20.114 --> 11:24.422
I killed them. It was me,
I did it. And now,
they're coming. Coming...

11:25.293 --> 11:28.035
Hey! Listen to me.
Listen to me.

11:28.078 --> 11:32.692
You didn't kill. Okay? Shh!
The Worldkiller in you did.

11:32.735 --> 11:35.912
I am Purity. I am Purity.

11:35.956 --> 11:37.218
No, you're not.

11:37.261 --> 11:40.177
I am! I am! I am!

11:40.221 --> 11:45.226
-I am!
-Hey! Hey! Snap out of it!
Look at me!

11:46.618 --> 11:49.143
What's your name?
Tell me your name.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.102
-Tell me your name.
-I--

11:52.146 --> 11:54.452
-Come on, you got it.
-I don't know...

11:54.496 --> 11:56.063
Think, think.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.980
I'm Julia Freeman.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.809
Julia, what do you remember?

12:04.375 --> 12:05.986
-My parents.
-Okay.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.552
-I remember them.
-Okay.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.337
I'm a musician.

12:09.380 --> 12:13.080
That's good. I want you
to sing me a song, okay?

12:14.429 --> 12:15.735
What's your favorite song?

12:19.869 --> 12:23.133
-It's okay.
-I can't remember the name
of it.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.918
It's okay. You don't have
to remember the name.

12:24.961 --> 12:27.529
-I can't remember--
-Just the tune, just the tune.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.444
Just hum it to yourself.

12:29.487 --> 12:31.751
My daughter does that
when she's scared.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.491
My daughter...

12:35.450 --> 12:38.061
-My daughter.
-[humming faintly]

12:40.150 --> 12:41.456
[whispers] My daughter.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.372
What's my daughter's name?

12:45.242 --> 12:48.550
My daughter. My daughter.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.817
-[voices] You killed us,
you did this.
-No...

12:55.078 --> 12:57.385
-Reign.
-My daughter's name...

12:58.212 --> 13:00.344
-I have a child.
-I had a child.

13:00.388 --> 13:01.693
My daughter's name!

13:01.737 --> 13:02.956
You killed us.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.305
-My daughter's name.
-You killed us all.

13:04.348 --> 13:05.828
I was a mother of three...

13:05.872 --> 13:07.787
-Stop!
-You did this.

13:08.048 --> 13:12.400
My daughter's name is Ruby!
Ruby!

13:13.880 --> 13:15.229
[panting]

13:16.883 --> 13:18.798
We have to remember
who we are.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.238
Here. Take that rock.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.284
Write what you know!
Write what you know!

13:27.328 --> 13:28.372
I don't know!

13:28.416 --> 13:30.200
-I don't know!
-Write it!

13:30.244 --> 13:31.723
Write it all down!

13:48.131 --> 13:50.786
What's so important that you'd
risk flying under a dying sun?

13:50.830 --> 13:51.961
Lena has Kryptonite.

13:54.616 --> 13:57.749
Yeah, I know. She called me
about an hour ago.

13:57.793 --> 14:00.970
She told me everything about
Sam and Reign.

14:02.276 --> 14:03.799
Kara, she also told me

14:03.843 --> 14:06.019
that the Kryptonite was Lex's
and she used it all, so--

14:06.062 --> 14:10.240
Lex has been imprisoned
for years, but she held
on to it, anyway.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.461
Kryptonite, James.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.464
Lex could have only had it
for one reason.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.728
To kill Clark.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.688
Look, I know how hard
this must be for you...

14:25.647 --> 14:26.822
Okay.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.826
I know how bad Kryptonite is,

14:30.870 --> 14:32.610
and I've seen firsthand
what it can do to you.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.917
And I can't even begin
to imagine

14:34.961 --> 14:36.963
what kind of pain
that must feel like.

14:37.441 --> 14:41.271
We have to get one thing
clear, though.
Lena is not Lex.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.621
And it took me a long time
to figure that out,

14:43.665 --> 14:45.710
but you're the one
who made me see that.

14:45.754 --> 14:48.061
The Lena I've known
up till now has only been
an ally.

14:48.365 --> 14:51.542
I want to believe her,
but she lied about Sam.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.982
I have to know
she's telling the truth.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.941
-What do you want me to do?
-Not you.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.551
Guardian.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.468
I need you to find out
if there really isn't
any Kryptonite left.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.255
Kara, you're asking me
to betray somebody that
I really care about.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.300
I really care about her, too.

15:10.997 --> 15:14.348
So, let's put this to bed.
Once and for all.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.404
Can I ask you something?

15:29.450 --> 15:31.713
You want to know why I didn't
come to you when I found
what Sam really was.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.934
I'm the one who did
the first tests on her.

15:35.543 --> 15:38.546
And I'm the one that told her
to come to her friends
about her illness.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.157
So, why not just tell me
the truth?

15:41.462 --> 15:43.551
Same reason you didn't tell me
you were really DEO.

15:44.726 --> 15:45.857
You knew.

15:47.337 --> 15:48.948
My mother's DEO enemy
number one. Of course I knew.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.515
But it was your secret
to keep.

15:51.559 --> 15:54.649
Just like Sam's true nature
is hers. It wasn't my place
to say anything.

15:56.085 --> 15:59.741
Fair enough. Just tell me
one thing.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.962
-Is Ruby safe?
-Yes.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.314
How's it coming?

16:07.662 --> 16:09.969
The eclipse is diminishing
your strength severely.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.145
I can send you into this
dark valley, but adding
the weight

16:12.188 --> 16:15.409
of two more minds to yours
will weaken you further.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.628
Your biology is impressive,

16:17.672 --> 16:20.066
but even you weren't built
to be an inter-dimensional
portal.

16:21.763 --> 16:24.026
-Can I talk to you
for a second?
-Yeah.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.465
[Mon-El] What's up?

16:30.293 --> 16:32.861
If this thing goes sideways,
I need you to
promise me something.

16:34.602 --> 16:38.258
Pull Alex and Lena out,
but leave me in until
I finish the mission.

16:39.781 --> 16:42.349
You heard Brainy. This could
hurt you. This could kill you.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.394
This is our only chance

16:44.438 --> 16:47.223
to save now or the future.
This is all we've got.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.138
So, promise me.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.400
[sighs]

16:53.708 --> 16:55.101
I promise.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.365
Once I induce transmission,

16:58.408 --> 17:00.932
your minds will be immediately
beamed into this dark valley.

17:01.455 --> 17:02.978
Is it gonna hurt?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.894
-The chances are
better than 50%.
-That's comforting.

17:05.937 --> 17:10.159
Really? I didn't think so.
Would you like me
to count to three?

17:10.203 --> 17:12.205
-Will it help?
-No, not at all.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.641
Let's just get it over with.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.177
[all gasp]

17:31.876 --> 17:33.095
We're here.

17:44.672 --> 17:49.024
-This is impressive.
-This is Juru.

17:50.591 --> 17:51.983
Are those for Sam and Julia?

17:52.027 --> 17:54.638
It's for whatever might
be around.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.684
I don't even know if anything
here can get injured.

17:56.988 --> 17:59.078
-Ow!
-Yeah, we're good.

17:59.687 --> 18:02.646
This one. I like this one,
it's mine.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.344
Thanks.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.607
[winces]

18:07.129 --> 18:09.827
Yep, this place bites.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.702
-Oh, my God.
-[Supergirl] What?

18:16.791 --> 18:19.315
-That's Grace.
-Who?

18:19.359 --> 18:22.057
She's the human form
of one of the Worldkillers.

18:22.492 --> 18:25.408
[stammers] She's dead.

18:26.322 --> 18:29.456
Which means that
we're running out of time
with Sam and Julia.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.763
They headed in this direction.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.074
[Brainy] Fifty-four minutes
to totality.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.120
[EKG beeping]

18:48.257 --> 18:49.650
-[beeping rapidly]
-[breathing heavily]

18:54.089 --> 18:55.308
[beeping slows]

19:12.586 --> 19:13.587
Mon-El.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.375
She just looks so breakable.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.377
She's strong, they all are.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.162
All I wanna do
is pull her out.

19:24.902 --> 19:28.210
-Yeah, me, too.
-But I can't do that, I can't.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.996
I can't do that. I can't
help her, I can't hold her.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.528
I can't hurt my wife.

19:45.967 --> 19:46.968
What do I do?

19:48.970 --> 19:53.192
There's nothing to do, Mon-El.
Come on.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.327
Thanks, Shaw.

20:00.068 --> 20:03.071
Okay, this is Eagle
in the nest. How're you doing,
Baby Bird?

20:03.114 --> 20:04.203
[Guardian] No.

20:05.465 --> 20:08.207
Oh, come on, I like that one.
Are you in?

20:08.990 --> 20:11.253
Yeah, I'm in Lena's lab.
Where's the vault?

20:11.297 --> 20:14.213
Head north.
Or wait, more helpfully, left.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.958
-You don't look so good.
-I'm just tired.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.831
Brainy said it'd be hard
for me to carry both of you
in here.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.398
[Supergirl panting]

20:25.441 --> 20:28.357
Is this what it's like
when humans exercise?

20:29.663 --> 20:31.665
This is terrible.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.362
Why would you ever exercise?

20:33.623 --> 20:36.583
-[Alex] One foot in front
of the other.
-[sighs] It's fine.

20:36.626 --> 20:40.239
It's no worse than
light Kryptonite poisoning.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.939
Come on. There's too much
at stake for you to still be
mad at me.

20:44.982 --> 20:46.810
I said we would work together.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.682
Never said it would be
sunshine and rainbows.

20:48.725 --> 20:51.554
Great, 'cause we're a little
lacking on sunshine right now.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.817
What I did wasn't personal.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.690
You had a stash of
"Kills Kryptonians," Lena.

20:57.212 --> 20:58.474
It's personal.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.128
I would never use it for that.
You know that.

21:00.171 --> 21:01.999
I thought I knew
everything I needed to know,

21:02.043 --> 21:04.480
but you have secrets.
It changes things.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.177
Oh, right,
you don't like secrets.

21:06.221 --> 21:07.353
Nope, I don't.

21:07.396 --> 21:09.442
Good. What's your real name?

21:11.226 --> 21:14.708
It's not a great question
for a Luthor to ask someone
in my family.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.885
You have secrets,
I can get on board with that.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.365
I have secrets, too.

21:29.984 --> 21:33.379
-What the hell was that?
-The reason we have sticks.

21:36.730 --> 21:37.818
[roars]

21:41.256 --> 21:44.085
That's a Kryptonian demon.
I've seen them before.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.653
That's where they went.
We're running out of time.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.046
I think I see an entrance
over there.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.714
All right, come on. Come on.

22:20.426 --> 22:21.601
[Julia whimpering]

22:27.389 --> 22:30.349
Julia. Julia!

22:30.784 --> 22:33.308
Julia, it's Supergirl
and Agent Danvers.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.529
-Can you hear me?
-[Supergirl]
We're here to help you.

22:39.706 --> 22:40.707
Oh, God!

22:43.536 --> 22:45.973
-I killed him.
-What?

22:46.234 --> 22:48.192
I killed them.

22:48.584 --> 22:51.326
And the cameras are
officially disabled,
you're welcome.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.459
[Guardian] Good work.

22:57.637 --> 23:00.466
I don't know how anybody
survived three Worldkillers
in here.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.293
Yeah, man, I'm glad
I wasn't there.

23:02.337 --> 23:04.774
Yeah, cheers to that.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.909
Speaking of Lena,
I got eyes on the vault.

23:09.344 --> 23:11.128
Impressive, I know.

23:11.172 --> 23:12.782
Yeah. It's almost as if she
didn't want anybody
to get in there.

23:12.826 --> 23:15.306
Yeah, no keypads, no locks,

23:15.350 --> 23:19.789
no internal mechanisms,
just thick,
acetylene-resistant cast iron.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.618
But, hey, you got one thing
Lena doesn't.

23:22.662 --> 23:25.316
-Yeah, what's that?
-Me, you dummy. Come on.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.319
Well, technically,
the, uh, pin-drop pulse-bomb
I built you,

23:28.363 --> 23:31.192
but I built it, so,
technically, me. Oh, God.

23:32.236 --> 23:35.414
Yeah, just, uh,
set it anywhere,

23:35.675 --> 23:38.634
then walk, like, way far back,
and then set it off.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.680
The door will open.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.294
[sighs]

23:50.951 --> 23:53.649
Hello, are you there?
Did you do it?
Are you in? James?

23:56.739 --> 23:57.740
Yeah, I'm in.

23:59.089 --> 24:01.004
Look, Winn,
there's nothing here.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.399
Lena was telling the truth,
she's clean.

24:04.878 --> 24:07.750
[exhales] Well, thank
goodness. I did not have
the emotional bandwidth

24:07.794 --> 24:09.230
for another enemy,
gotta tell you.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.710
-[knocking on door]
-Yeah. Gotta run, gotta run.

24:10.753 --> 24:13.277
[clears throat] Hey.

24:15.410 --> 24:16.585
Are you all right?

24:16.629 --> 24:18.152
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

24:18.195 --> 24:21.242
Well, you spent an exceedingly
long time in the bathroom.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.637
This isn't a bathroom.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.162
You're here.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.859
Of course we're here.
You think I'd forget
about you?

24:31.470 --> 24:32.645
Lena.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.561
Alex.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.606
Supergirl.

24:39.869 --> 24:43.046
I killed you, too. I'm sorry.

24:43.090 --> 24:44.526
-Sam, no.
-I'm sorry.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.834
No, Reign didn't kill us.
We're here to help you.

24:47.877 --> 24:48.922
We're gonna get you
out of here.

24:48.965 --> 24:50.184
The people I killed
are coming.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.360
Reign killed, not you.

24:52.403 --> 24:55.276
We're gonna make sure Reign
never hurts anyone again.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.887
But, Sam, you have to wake up.

24:57.931 --> 25:00.760
You have to go back
to your body
and send us a message,

25:00.803 --> 25:02.588
tell us where
the Worldkillers are.

25:02.631 --> 25:05.242
Don't let them in.
They want me.

25:06.156 --> 25:09.812
-I killed them.
-Hey. Hey, you are not
a murderer.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.423
-[groaning]
-[beeping rapidly]

25:12.467 --> 25:15.122
-Ten minutes to totality.
-She can't take much more.

25:15.601 --> 25:16.819
Keep her in.

25:16.863 --> 25:19.256
-She's only got minutes.
-I said, keep her in.

25:21.476 --> 25:26.089
Hey. Hey! We have to
get you out of here.

25:27.395 --> 25:29.789
No. Not yet. Not yet. Sam?

25:29.832 --> 25:31.530
[Alex]
We don't have much time.

25:31.573 --> 25:34.141
Come on, stay with us.
Remember who you are.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.491
Hey, you are Sam Arias, okay?

25:36.535 --> 25:38.188
You're the woman
I would trust with anything.

25:38.232 --> 25:40.147
-You're good.
-You have friends.

25:40.190 --> 25:41.801
-You're a fighter.
-You're a mother.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.107
Remember Ruby?
Ruby's just waiting
for you to come home.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.805
Sam, you have to think
of Ruby.

25:45.848 --> 25:46.980
-Ruby.
-[Lena] Remember Ruby?

25:47.023 --> 25:48.851
-[Alex] Ruby.
-[inhales sharply]

26:01.560 --> 26:03.387
-Let her go!
-I'll break her neck.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.478
[Sam breathing heavily]

26:27.934 --> 26:30.850
Take me!
Take me instead, please!

26:30.893 --> 26:34.810
You. You are nothing.
You've always been nothing.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.552
Only one of equal strength
can defeat me.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.989
You are driftwood
in the face of a hurricane.

26:57.311 --> 26:59.574
It worked. We've got
a location.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.490
-Pull them out, now.
-[Imra] Setting a course.

27:03.926 --> 27:04.927
No!

27:15.895 --> 27:17.113
-You!
-[gasps]

27:17.461 --> 27:18.462
[screeching]

27:30.823 --> 27:31.998
Human!

27:42.138 --> 27:43.749
I thought that might work.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.407
It did, thank you.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.760
-They're coming.
-No, they're already here.

27:59.242 --> 28:00.679
[gasps]

28:03.159 --> 28:04.987
-It worked?
-Like a charm.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.815
Are we still talking
about dark magic?

28:06.859 --> 28:09.426
-You should rest some more.
-Since when has that ever
stopped me?

28:10.166 --> 28:11.733
-Let's go.
-Hey, hey, what about me?

28:12.560 --> 28:13.604
Help Brainy.

28:16.085 --> 28:18.044
-Okay.
-Okay.

28:18.087 --> 28:20.786
-Hey, Alex.
-Yeah, I gotta go catch up.

28:20.829 --> 28:23.527
-Listen, this is worth
the wait.
-Okay.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.660
I've always thought
it was like, super unfair,
you know.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.794
J'onn can phase
through things,
he can shape-shift...

28:28.837 --> 28:32.319
Then you got Supergirl,
she can laser-vision,
you know.

28:32.362 --> 28:34.930
Freeze-breath,
she's massively strong...

28:34.974 --> 28:37.846
You're not making me feel
super-hyped
to go join the fight, but...

28:38.151 --> 28:39.935
Exactly! Exactly.

28:40.196 --> 28:42.764
Right? So, I'm thinking,
"What does the best,

28:42.808 --> 28:46.202
most badass DEO agent need

28:46.507 --> 28:49.118
to take her battle-readiness
up a notch?"

28:52.774 --> 28:53.819
You didn't.

28:53.862 --> 28:57.039
Oh, girl, I did,
and then some.

28:57.561 --> 29:02.044
What if I told you
the future is magnets?

29:02.523 --> 29:03.654
[grunts]

29:06.875 --> 29:11.662
That ring literally costs more
than this entire ship.

29:12.098 --> 29:13.360
Also,

29:14.143 --> 29:15.362
it hurt.

29:17.016 --> 29:19.758
And wait until you see
the bullets.

29:23.239 --> 29:24.675
I'm gonna go change now.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.027
[chuckles]

29:28.070 --> 29:30.638
-Oh, the bathroom's that way.
-Right. That... Yeah.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.989
[Brainy] Structure
nearly breached.
Prepare for drop.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.266
[Purity screeching]

29:51.659 --> 29:54.096
-What was that?
-Main thrusters are damaged.

29:54.140 --> 29:56.142
-How?
-Some sort of soundwave
interference.

29:56.185 --> 29:57.317
Purity.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.275
It's fine, we have
secondary thrusters.

30:00.929 --> 30:05.629
Which also just blew up.
Excuse me a moment.

30:10.591 --> 30:11.897
Come on, come on, come on.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.986
Hey, hey--

30:14.029 --> 30:15.901
There. Good as new.

30:16.945 --> 30:18.381
What are you doing?

30:18.425 --> 30:19.905
I'm helping.

30:19.948 --> 30:22.385
No, no. That's not
how that works.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.693
Actually, that's exactly
how that works.

30:25.998 --> 30:29.262
I know. Pull up 6,000 feet,
and vent the engines.

30:32.221 --> 30:33.832
You are weak.

30:36.660 --> 30:37.836
[groans]

30:39.838 --> 30:41.230
[grunting]

30:53.025 --> 30:55.027
I've got this.
Check on the others.

30:56.985 --> 30:58.465
Thanks, Winn.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.132
I don't think you know
what you're becoming.

31:13.175 --> 31:16.570
I've already become.
I am death, and I choose
you first!

31:24.447 --> 31:25.884
[screaming]

31:37.025 --> 31:38.026
Julia?

31:41.203 --> 31:42.552
You're in there. I know it.

31:44.163 --> 31:48.645
Come on,
you gotta rise up and help us.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.315
[grunting]

32:14.149 --> 32:17.761
The eclipse is full.
No more powers.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.205
[groans]

32:47.748 --> 32:49.402
[gasping]

32:50.272 --> 32:52.144
Alex! No.

33:10.945 --> 33:12.642
[grunting]

33:19.388 --> 33:20.694
[growls]

33:24.480 --> 33:27.135
-Julia.
-Julia, please!

33:27.179 --> 33:29.094
-[Supergirl] Julia.
-Julia, rise up.

33:29.137 --> 33:32.097
[Supergirl] Julia, I can't
do this. You're still
strong enough.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.141
Help us!

33:33.489 --> 33:34.838
It's over.

33:39.713 --> 33:41.019
What did you say before?

33:42.063 --> 33:45.675
That only one of
equal strength can beat you.

33:48.504 --> 33:49.766
Well, come at me, witch.

33:51.159 --> 33:52.421
[screeching]

34:01.430 --> 34:03.867
[gasps] No! No!

34:09.047 --> 34:12.224
-[choking]
-I always knew you were weak.

34:13.747 --> 34:15.053
[screaming]

34:18.578 --> 34:19.883
No!

34:25.454 --> 34:26.455
No!

34:31.112 --> 34:33.462
-She's not gonna make it.
-I'm so sorry.

34:49.783 --> 34:53.787
She did it. She did it.
Pestilence is dead.

35:06.713 --> 35:09.150
[screeching]

35:12.414 --> 35:13.981
Let's get the hell outta here.

35:32.608 --> 35:33.827
Hey.

35:37.047 --> 35:38.310
Hey yourself.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.013
[sighs] We did it.

35:46.883 --> 35:51.932
The future of
our friends and family...

35:54.543 --> 35:55.675
Your sister.

36:00.027 --> 36:02.203
We saved everyone.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.945
We beat Pestilence,
we stopped the Blight.

36:06.338 --> 36:07.817
[sighs]

36:07.861 --> 36:08.862
It's all over.

36:11.691 --> 36:12.909
So, I guess we can
go home now.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.044
I guess so.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.878
Hey, can we even get home?

36:27.272 --> 36:29.187
Brainy will figure it out.

36:29.622 --> 36:33.234
-Otherwise, he loses
the nickname "Brainy".
-[chuckles]

36:57.258 --> 36:59.652
The fortress is gone,
like it was never there.

37:00.348 --> 37:01.828
Stone turned to sand.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.918
And Reign is gone, too,
she's untraceable.

37:05.179 --> 37:07.834
You know that eclipse ended
as soon as the fortress
was destroyed.

37:07.877 --> 37:11.316
We got rid of two out
of the three Worldkillers.
Like, that's a win.

37:11.359 --> 37:14.797
-And we'll find Sam, somehow.
-I know.

37:15.276 --> 37:18.236
Hey. Hey, cool new suit!

37:19.454 --> 37:20.542
Winn did me a solid.

37:20.586 --> 37:22.370
Yes, upgrades.

37:22.414 --> 37:25.547
Well, I'd been asking
the Director of the DEO
for one for years,

37:25.591 --> 37:27.723
but I just kept
getting denied.

37:27.767 --> 37:30.073
Blame it on Congress,
I don't write out budgets.

37:30.117 --> 37:31.858
Besides, don't you
miss your polo?

37:31.901 --> 37:33.686
It looked like
it was sweat-wicking.

37:33.729 --> 37:37.864
I have a really cool new gun.
Don't think it won't
work on you.

37:38.778 --> 37:39.779
Don't shoot.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.610
Hey, we didn't get
to talk earlier.

37:45.654 --> 37:48.135
-James and I did
the thing you asked...
-And?

37:48.178 --> 37:51.573
James said that the vault
was empty.
There's no more Kryptonite.

37:51.617 --> 37:54.968
And, uh, looks like Lena
is telling the truth.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.495
Hey, Lena.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.980
-Nice work back there.
-Yeah, you weren't
so bad yourself.

38:08.111 --> 38:09.330
Yeah, we couldn't save Sam.

38:09.374 --> 38:11.463
But we saved Julia.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.595
And if Julia can overcome
the demons inside of her,

38:13.639 --> 38:15.467
then Sam has a chance, too.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.209
I hope you're right.

38:20.428 --> 38:23.562
Hey, actually, um,
I wanted to talk to you.

38:26.608 --> 38:29.785
I may have been overreacting.

38:30.960 --> 38:34.137
As far as I'm concerned,
our slate is clean.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.838
Well, I can work with that.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.847
[James sighs]

39:00.468 --> 39:01.774
Surprised you'd want
to see me.

39:03.645 --> 39:07.040
You know, for quite some time,
I've been looking
for any reason...

39:07.606 --> 39:09.521
Any reason I could
to distrust you.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.915
It's not your fault,
it's just, um...

39:13.829 --> 39:15.744
Lex baggage, or whatever.

39:18.530 --> 39:22.708
But for the last two years,
you have done nothing
but prove me wrong.

39:24.231 --> 39:27.452
-Until now.
-No. No.

39:28.061 --> 39:31.760
The way I see it, your friend
came to you
with something unbearable.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.851
And you tried your best
to help her carry it.

39:37.897 --> 39:39.899
You did everything
in your power to help her,

39:39.942 --> 39:42.031
regardless of what that might
look like to other people,

39:42.075 --> 39:43.816
when they found out.

39:46.035 --> 39:47.950
And that's beautiful.

39:48.429 --> 39:49.865
That's somebody
I want to know.

39:51.954 --> 39:53.956
-Really?
-Yeah.

40:00.485 --> 40:03.879
But you have a decision
to make about me.

40:04.140 --> 40:06.926
-Of course I wanna know--
-I'm Guardian.

40:10.712 --> 40:11.887
Why are you telling me this?

40:12.279 --> 40:14.890
Because I did something
I'm not proud of.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.767
I broke into your lab.

40:23.072 --> 40:25.205
To determine
if you had more Kryptonite.

40:27.163 --> 40:28.251
Why would you do that?

40:28.295 --> 40:32.299
I had to. For Supergirl,
she asked me to.

40:32.778 --> 40:33.822
She did?

40:33.866 --> 40:36.390
She did, but I'm the one
who said yes.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.437
So, this is on me.

40:40.350 --> 40:44.485
But when I got in,
I couldn't go into your vault.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.444
I mean, I could.

40:48.533 --> 40:49.490
I didn't want to.

40:50.796 --> 40:52.232
I didn't need to.

40:54.234 --> 40:59.369
I trust you. I really hope
that you can trust me.

41:00.806 --> 41:02.155
Yes.

41:08.901 --> 41:10.511
There's something else
you need to know.

41:13.253 --> 41:14.428
Hit me.

41:17.039 --> 41:19.041
That wasn't Lex's Kryptonite.

41:20.869 --> 41:22.523
I figured out how to make it.

41:25.483 --> 41:30.488
[Dark Kryptonian]
The human in you must die.
The child must die.

41:31.576 --> 41:34.840
Ruby Arias must die.

41:44.327 --> 41:45.677
[screaming]
