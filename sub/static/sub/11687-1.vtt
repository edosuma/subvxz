So, this is
the type of behavior
that I can expect.

of adolescent abandon.

for this deviation
from the schedule

06:47.185 --> 06:48.718

11:45.136 --> 11:46.504
Are you a virgin?

11:46.505 --> 11:49.524
Uh, do you mean technically?

11:49.525 --> 11:51.543
You've come
to the right place.

11:51.544 --> 11:55.997
Eaglebauer enterprises
is a name that stands
for quality.

11:55.998 --> 12:00.085
I'm gonna get you a date
with the most primo lady
in this school -

12:00.086 --> 12:02.019
Kate Rambeau.

12:05.173 --> 12:08.626
Johnny, why don't you
tell Tom how happy
he'll be with Kate?

12:08.627 --> 12:10.678
<i>(Johnny over pa)</i>
<i>right you are, Mr. Bauer.</i>

12:10.679 --> 12:13.180
<i>Kate Rambeau, age 17,</i>
<i>attends Vince Lombardi high,</i>

12:13.181 --> 12:15.132
<i>Where she majors</i>
<i>in nuclear physics.</i>

12:15.133 --> 12:17.368
<i>This perky</i>
<i>gal-on-the-go's hobbies</i>

12:17.369 --> 12:19.503
<i>Include splitting protons</i>
<i>and checkers.</i>

12:19.504 --> 12:21.639
<i>Included</i>
<i>in your night to remember</i>

12:21.640 --> 12:24.492
<i>Is a matched set</i>
<i>of travelways luggage.</i>
<i>(girls' voices) ooh!</i>

12:24.493 --> 12:28.997
<i>That's travelways luggage,</i>
<i>the first name in travel</i>
<i>for over five years.</i>

12:28.998 --> 12:31.749
<i>And now back to you,</i>
<i>Mr. E.</i>

12:33.669 --> 12:36.538
Thank you, Johnny.
There she is, Tom.

12:36.539 --> 12:38.256
I had somebody else in mind.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.426
Oh, Tom, my files indicate
she's perfect for you.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.861
I know, I know,
but I was kinda hopin'

12:43.862 --> 12:46.264
That you'd set me up
with Riff Randell.

12:46.265 --> 12:49.685
Riff Randell?

12:49.686 --> 12:52.838
How about a cheerleader?
Nice set of pompoms.

12:52.839 --> 12:56.525
No! The only girl I ever
dream about at night is Riff,

12:56.526 --> 12:59.595
But I always keep waking up
just before the good part.

12:59.596 --> 13:04.415
Well, how are you set
for large amounts
of hard cash?

13:04.416 --> 13:07.719
<i>(snaps fingers) </i>
I have a major credit card.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.039
Uh, Norma, dear?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.824
Yes, Mr. Eaglebauer.

13:12.825 --> 13:15.627
Yes, would you
draw up a contract
for Tom Roberts

13:15.628 --> 13:17.495
And Riff Randell?

13:27.640 --> 13:30.843
<i>? you know her life is saved</i>
<i>by rock 'n' roll</i>

13:30.844 --> 13:32.344
<i>? yeah, rock 'n' roll... ?</i>

13:32.345 --> 13:33.979
What's that thing
in your ear, Randell?

13:33.980 --> 13:36.582
Um, it's a...
A hearing aid.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.083
Be careful, Miss Steroid.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.752
She's very sensitive
about it.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.355
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, Randell.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.123
What?

13:45.124 --> 13:48.627
Sorry to hear that,
Randell!

13:48.628 --> 13:51.196
Fine. How are you?

13:53.232 --> 13:55.535
Oh, I'm fine, thank you!

13:55.536 --> 13:58.837
Oh, I'd say
about a quarter to two.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.572
Come on, Riff,
let's go.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.375
But I just had lunch.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.679
So young.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.082
That was close.

14:10.083 --> 14:13.219
We just got out of trouble.
You wanna put us back in?

14:13.220 --> 14:16.655
Are you kidding?
"what's that thing
in your ear?"

14:16.656 --> 14:19.859
She doesn't even know
the Beatles broke up.

14:19.860 --> 14:23.896
I know something is going on
behind my back.

14:25.832 --> 14:28.134
You two are not
doing your jobs.

14:28.135 --> 14:31.571
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

14:31.572 --> 14:36.960
You're supposed to be my eyes,
my ears, my nose.

14:36.961 --> 14:38.628
ahchoo!

14:38.629 --> 14:40.597
Thank you.

14:40.598 --> 14:43.600
If this school
is going to get back
on the winning track,

14:43.601 --> 14:46.169
We have to start cracking down
immediately...

14:48.423 --> 14:53.927
And I know
just where to begin.

14:56.930 --> 15:01.535
Ok, you take a note
to Mr. Mcgree,

15:01.536 --> 15:07.340
And I want you
to take the same note
to coach steroid.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.209
Tell them
to meet me immediately

15:09.210 --> 15:11.310
In the science lab.

16:21.233 --> 16:25.436
The most famous notes in all
of the musical literature.

16:25.437 --> 16:27.405
Now...

16:30.125 --> 16:31.758
"earmail."

16:31.759 --> 16:33.927
Ha-ha-ha.

16:33.928 --> 16:37.265
Class, I have to go
to Miss Togar’s office.

16:37.266 --> 16:40.335
I'd like you
to look over the chapter
on Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony

16:40.336 --> 16:42.621
While I'm gone.

16:42.622 --> 16:45.223
Oh, and, class,
as soon as I get back,

16:45.224 --> 16:48.192
There's going to be
a surprise quiz
on this material.

16:48.193 --> 16:50.561
aww!

17:01.372 --> 17:03.273
Come on.

17:03.274 --> 17:05.976
Nice work, Rambeau.
I knew you could do it.

17:05.977 --> 17:08.296
Ok, now come on down.

17:08.297 --> 17:11.098
I'm stuck.

17:11.099 --> 17:14.135
Nonsense.
There's nothing to it.

17:14.136 --> 17:15.837
Just go hand over hand,

17:15.838 --> 17:19.457
But above all,
do not slide.

17:22.060 --> 17:24.329
Kate,
are you all right?

17:24.329 --> 17:27.365
All right, girls, she's ok.
You're ok, Rambeau.

17:27.366 --> 17:29.301
Get up and walk it off.

17:29.302 --> 17:31.402
Come on.
Come on, girls.

17:31.403 --> 17:32.904
Let's move it.
Hey!

17:32.905 --> 17:35.673
You fat creep.

17:35.674 --> 17:38.276
Yes?
Note.

17:41.648 --> 17:46.885
"darling Evelyn,
how I long for the feel
your luscious thighs--"

17:46.886 --> 17:48.520
Oh, wrong note.

17:54.093 --> 17:57.896
All right, class...

17:57.897 --> 17:59.597
...Listen up.

17:59.598 --> 18:02.267
Are you ok?
I'm going to be gone
for a few minutes.

18:02.268 --> 18:04.869
While I'm away,
I want you to continue

18:04.870 --> 18:07.272
With your exercises
for the day.

18:07.273 --> 18:09.274
 aww!
Ah, none of that.

18:09.275 --> 18:11.176
let's have
a little enthusiasm.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.679
And a...

18:13.680 --> 18:17.884
...A-one and a-two
and a-jumping up and down.

18:17.885 --> 18:20.319
Come on, girls.
That's right.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.021
Peppy!

18:22.022 --> 18:25.324
Keep that up
till I get back.

18:32.499 --> 18:36.486
Well, you're probably wondering
why I called you here.

18:36.487 --> 18:37.537
Me.
I know, I know.

18:37.538 --> 18:38.871
Me.
I know.

18:38.872 --> 18:40.156
I know, I know.
Me.

18:40.157 --> 18:42.674
Go and monitor
the halls.

18:50.350 --> 18:52.685
Since assuming office
this morning,

18:52.686 --> 18:55.021
I've noticed a number
of peculiar incidents

18:55.022 --> 18:57.222
Among the members
of the student body,

18:57.223 --> 19:00.860
All having to do
with rock-'n'-roll music.

19:00.861 --> 19:03.729
Miss Togar, I have
no particular love
for rock-'n'-roll,

19:03.730 --> 19:06.399
But it doesn't seem to me
that listening to it

19:06.400 --> 19:08.367
Actually hurts
the students.

19:08.368 --> 19:11.737
 but that's
where you're wrong,
Mr. Mcgree.

19:11.738 --> 19:13.839
Recently,
I have been doing a study

19:13.840 --> 19:17.010
Of mice subjected
to rock-'n'-roll music.

19:18.980 --> 19:21.581
Here we have a picture
of this mouse,

19:21.582 --> 19:24.601
A typical member
of the genus <i>rattus rodenti,</i>

19:24.602 --> 19:27.754
As he appeared
before the start
of my investigation -

19:27.755 --> 19:30.257
Clean, good-natured,

19:30.258 --> 19:35.796
Content to scamper playfully
about his cage.

19:35.797 --> 19:41.467
This is a picture
of the same mouse...

19:41.468 --> 19:45.104
One week after the introduction
of rock-'n'-roll music.

19:45.105 --> 19:46.555
I never dreamed.

19:46.556 --> 19:48.609
Oh, the results
were dramatic.

19:48.610 --> 19:50.777
He lost all interest

19:50.778 --> 19:52.980
In keeping
his cage tidy.

19:52.981 --> 19:54.447
How scientific.

19:54.448 --> 19:56.733
He played
his electric guitar
far into the night,

19:56.734 --> 19:58.968
Keeping the other
test animals awake.

19:58.969 --> 20:00.270
He did?

20:00.271 --> 20:02.272
And he met
this female mouse,

20:02.273 --> 20:04.774
And they have been sharing
a cage together

20:04.775 --> 20:06.443
Out of wedlock.

20:06.444 --> 20:08.662
That's fascinating,
Miss Togar.

20:08.663 --> 20:12.666
Yes, it is.

20:12.667 --> 20:15.101
Is she crazy?

20:15.102 --> 20:16.720
She's a principal.

20:16.721 --> 20:18.722
Monitor the hall,
monitor the hall.

20:18.723 --> 20:21.659
I am sick
of monitoring the hall.

20:21.660 --> 20:23.695
Yep.

20:23.696 --> 20:27.065
Let's go monitor
the freshman.
Good idea.

20:27.066 --> 20:28.199
Get him.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.034
All right,
up against the wall.

20:30.035 --> 20:31.703
Spread 'em.

20:31.704 --> 20:34.472
All right, what the hell
do you think you're doing
out here?

20:34.473 --> 20:36.306
I was just getting
my books.

20:36.307 --> 20:39.275
Listen,
you have a hall pass?
Well, no.

20:39.276 --> 20:42.278
no hall pass?
Hit him, hit him.

20:42.279 --> 20:45.816
Guys, I'm allergic to violence.
I break out in blood.
Hit him anyway.

20:45.817 --> 20:48.251
Calm down.
Let me see some id.
I haven't got all day.

20:48.252 --> 20:50.253
I need it
for the sock hop tonight.

20:50.254 --> 20:53.224
The sock hop.
Who'd dance with you?

20:53.225 --> 20:56.828
All you have is a buck?
I'll have that.

20:56.829 --> 20:59.764
Is this you?
Well, I take
a bad picture.

20:59.765 --> 21:02.133
Tell me about it.
ugh.

21:02.134 --> 21:05.737
Listen, I'm gonna give you
a demerit.
What's a demerit?

21:05.738 --> 21:09.206
If you get enough of 'em,
you wind up in Miss Togar's
office.

21:09.207 --> 21:11.876
 ? demerit, demerit
well, what for?

21:11.877 --> 21:14.746
Because...
...You're ugly.

21:14.747 --> 21:16.748
Hit him now.
Hit him. Hit him.

21:16.749 --> 21:19.017
I have a great idea.
Let's go monitor
the girls' gym.

21:19.018 --> 21:20.518
All right.
Ok?

21:33.332 --> 21:34.565
what are you doing, Riff?

21:34.566 --> 21:37.335
Gym class called
on account of boredom.

21:37.336 --> 21:39.403
Got some of my homework
instead.

21:39.404 --> 21:42.206
Homework?
Yeah, for Mr. Mcgree's
songwriting class.

21:42.207 --> 21:44.242
I've written a song
for the Ramones.

21:44.243 --> 21:46.710
wait till you hear this.

21:46.711 --> 21:48.712
whoo!

21:54.570 --> 21:59.507
? rock, rock, rock, rock,
rock 'n' roll high school

21:59.508 --> 22:02.377
? well, I don't care
about history

22:02.378 --> 22:04.680
? rock, rock,
rock 'n' roll high school

22:04.681 --> 22:07.716
? 'cause that's not
where I wanna be

22:07.717 --> 22:10.052
? rock, rock,

22:10.053 --> 22:12.754
? I just wanna have some kicks

22:12.755 --> 22:15.323
? I just wanna
get some chicks

22:15.324 --> 22:18.310
? rock, rock, rock, rock,

22:18.311 --> 22:19.912

22:19.913 --> 22:22.848
? well, the girls out there
knock me out, you know

22:22.849 --> 22:25.000
? rock, rock,

22:25.001 --> 22:28.036
? cruisin' around in my GTO

22:28.037 --> 22:30.339
? rock, rock,
rock 'n' roll high school

22:30.340 --> 22:32.775
? well, I don't like
the teachers and the principal

22:32.776 --> 22:35.210
? don't wanna be taught
to be no fool

22:35.211 --> 22:37.963
? rock, rock, rock, rock,
rock 'n' roll high school

22:37.964 --> 22:41.367
? rock, rock, rock, rock,
rock 'n' roll high school

22:43.403 --> 22:46.372
? fun, fun,

22:46.373 --> 22:48.891
<i>(both giggle) </i>

22:48.892 --> 22:51.193
? fun, fun,

22:51.194 --> 22:52.477
? fun, fun

22:52.478 --> 22:53.778
? oh, baby

22:53.779 --> 22:55.146
? fun, fun

22:55.147 --> 22:56.415
? oh, baby

22:56.416 --> 22:58.950
? fun, fun,

22:58.951 --> 23:01.720
? rock, rock, rock, rock,

? rock, rock, rock, rock,

23:04.558 --> 23:07.010
? rock, rock, rock, rock,
rock 'n' roll high school...

23:07.011 --> 23:11.180
Next I investigated reports
of loss of hearing
by individuals

23:11.181 --> 23:13.650
Due to the high decibel level
involved

23:13.651 --> 23:16.986
In playing
rock-'n'-roll music.

23:16.987 --> 23:19.622
Put on these
ear protective devices,

23:19.623 --> 23:21.691
As I am going to -
Mr. Mcgree -

23:21.692 --> 23:23.960
Play a song by the Ramones

23:23.961 --> 23:26.562
At the decibel level
consistent with that used

23:26.563 --> 23:29.398
In your average concert.

23:29.399 --> 23:31.500
Your standard mouse

23:31.501 --> 23:33.502
And your standard speakers.

23:33.503 --> 23:35.405
Now, back, back.

23:37.274 --> 23:39.676
This is
the rock-o-meter.
Gee.

23:39.677 --> 23:44.798
It is used to measure
comparative rock-'n'-roll
intensity levels.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.634
Watch the mouse
while I turn it on.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.569
<i>(? "teenage lobotomy"</i>
<i>by the Ramones) </i>

23:49.570 --> 23:51.654

23:51.655 --> 23:53.572

23:53.573 --> 23:55.541

23:55.542 --> 23:57.060

23:57.061 --> 23:59.329

24:08.139 --> 24:10.423

24:13.328 --> 24:15.929

24:15.930 --> 24:18.098

<i>? all the girls</i>
<i>are in love with me-- ?</i>

24:24.054 --> 24:25.271
Notice the loss of hearing.

24:25.272 --> 24:27.040
The gym!
Girls!

24:27.041 --> 24:28.875

24:31.111 --> 24:33.496

to tell us something.

24:33.497 --> 24:34.797
Ok.

24:34.798 --> 24:38.301

26:08.977 --> 26:10.612
They're dancing.

26:10.613 --> 26:13.180
Oh, no, Miss Togar,
it's calisthenics.

26:13.181 --> 26:15.451
Where are their books?

26:16.585 --> 26:18.219
This is a gym class.

26:18.220 --> 26:21.589
They're exercising
their bodies.

26:23.225 --> 26:27.229
What these girls need
is to exercise their minds.

26:30.666 --> 26:33.401
I told you -
she's crazy.

26:35.738 --> 26:38.240
All right, girls,
hit the showers!

26:46.849 --> 26:48.884
All right, girls.
Come on, let's go.

27:03.700 --> 27:09.405
Uh, Cheryl, do you think
Tom Roberts is cute?

27:09.406 --> 27:11.707
Yeah,
but he's such a dork.

27:11.708 --> 27:14.675
No, he's not.
I think he's a fox.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.077
A fox?

27:16.078 --> 27:19.748
Tom Roberts is so boring,
his brother is an only child.

27:19.749 --> 27:22.251
He's not half as hot
as Joey Ramone.

27:22.252 --> 27:23.585
Who's Joey Ramone?

27:23.586 --> 27:25.687
Where have you been -
Mars?

27:25.688 --> 27:27.623
Earth calling Kate.

27:27.624 --> 27:30.893
He just happens
to be the lead singer
of the Ramones.

27:30.894 --> 27:33.896
I wish we could
see them this Thursday
at their concert.

27:33.897 --> 27:35.398
So what's stopping you?

27:35.399 --> 27:38.234
We can't cut classes
to stand in line
for tickets.

27:38.235 --> 27:40.236
That's right.
Oh, please.

27:40.237 --> 27:42.738
Ten years from now,
no one will care

27:42.739 --> 27:45.841
If you've ever been
to high school, much less
skipped a few classes.

27:45.842 --> 27:48.677
You all act
as if everything's
so important around here.

27:48.678 --> 27:51.013
Just because Togar
is stuck in the '50s

27:51.014 --> 27:53.583
Doesn't mean
there isn't life
after high school.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.053
I've got my own future
to think about.

27:56.054 --> 27:58.088
I know I can write
for the Ramones.

27:58.089 --> 28:00.890
All I've gotta do
is get my songs to them.

28:00.891 --> 28:02.959
They won't be in town
for another year,

28:02.960 --> 28:04.961
So I've got to
see them now.

28:04.962 --> 28:06.963
Hey, we wanna go
as much as you,

28:06.964 --> 28:08.965
But we can't all
cut classes.

28:08.966 --> 28:10.966
Well, I guess
it's up to me, then,

28:10.967 --> 28:12.968
But you'll have to
cover for me, Kate.

28:12.969 --> 28:15.504
I'm gonna take
a three-day leave
from Camp Lombardi

28:15.505 --> 28:16.939
And be first in line.

28:16.940 --> 28:19.775
If anyone wants to join me
at front-row center,

28:19.776 --> 28:21.610
Why, you just let me know.

28:21.611 --> 28:22.911

 yeah.

Kate Rambeau.

30:58.071 --> 30:59.171
Kate, yeah.
Come on in.

30:59.172 --> 31:01.272
Hello, Mr. Eaglebauer.

31:01.273 --> 31:03.274
How are you doing?
Great, thank you.

31:03.275 --> 31:05.744
Please, sit down,
sit down.

31:05.745 --> 31:09.047
What can I do
for you, Kate?

31:09.048 --> 31:11.116
Well, I wanna go out
on a date.

31:11.117 --> 31:15.086
Say no more.
Eaglebauer enterprises
has a man for you.

31:15.087 --> 31:19.341
Tell me, have you had
much experience with boys?

31:19.342 --> 31:23.862
Well... Once I played nurse
with a boy next door

31:23.863 --> 31:26.915
And got sued
for malpractice.

31:28.384 --> 31:31.369
I wish part of Riff
would rub off on me.

31:31.370 --> 31:34.188
Everything's so easy for her.

31:34.189 --> 31:37.159
Did you have
any one particular person
in mind?

31:37.160 --> 31:40.296
Well, I was kind of hoping

31:40.297 --> 31:42.899
That you might fix me up
with...

31:42.900 --> 31:44.917
With Tom Roberts.

31:44.918 --> 31:48.254
Tom Roberts?
Yeah.

31:48.255 --> 31:50.439
I love him.
He's a great guy.
I love him.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.291
Well, can you do it?

31:52.292 --> 31:53.842
This will never work.

31:53.843 --> 31:57.079
Tom will never like me.
I don't know who I'm kidding.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.080
What possible reason
could there be

31:59.081 --> 32:01.550
To put myself
through all this?

32:01.551 --> 32:03.552
Sex.

32:03.553 --> 32:06.087
I must admit,
as far as reasons go,

32:06.088 --> 32:08.122
It must be one of the best.

32:08.123 --> 32:10.660
Kate, I've known Tom
ever since he was a freshman,

32:10.661 --> 32:12.629
When I sold him
his first touchdown.

32:12.630 --> 32:15.532
Believe me, you're just
the type of girl he goes for.

32:15.533 --> 32:20.069
<i>(? "did we meet</i>
<i>somewhere before?")</i>

32:22.907 --> 32:26.042
Tom, my man.

32:26.043 --> 32:29.245
How's my would-be Romeo?
Eaglebauer, what are we
doing up here?

32:29.246 --> 32:31.380
I thought we were gonna
start training today.

32:31.381 --> 32:33.466
This is the perfect spot
for it.

32:33.467 --> 32:35.901
Most romantic setting
in the city.

32:35.902 --> 32:40.056
Just you, the skyline
and your training partner.

32:40.057 --> 32:43.260
Training partner?

32:43.261 --> 32:44.962
Hi, Tom.

32:44.963 --> 32:48.081
I was kind of expecting
Riff Randell.

32:48.082 --> 32:51.101
Eaglebauer, I don't know
whether I can go through
with this.

32:51.102 --> 32:53.203
Couldn't I just practice
with myself?

32:53.204 --> 32:56.121
You done too much of that
already.
Yeah.

32:56.122 --> 33:00.059
Now, for the next three days,

33:00.060 --> 33:03.763
You two are gonna have
nothing but fun.

33:03.764 --> 33:07.333
Now, the first lesson -
necking.

33:07.334 --> 33:11.971
The place - lovers' Lane.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.861
The reason -

33:17.862 --> 33:19.446
Well, you're young.

33:23.017 --> 33:26.286
Now, what's the first thing
you guys do?

33:28.189 --> 33:30.324
Aw, no, no, no, no.

34:28.668 --> 34:31.569
Now, this next step
can either make or break
a successful date.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.888
One-handed approach
to strap unfastening

34:33.889 --> 34:36.322
Is a basic skill
that must be mastered.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.427
Now watch closely
as I demonstrate.

34:39.428 --> 34:43.114
There's the hook.

34:43.114 --> 34:46.217
The snap.

34:46.217 --> 34:48.618
There is the double hook.

34:48.619 --> 34:50.922
There is
the dreaded minihooks.

34:53.058 --> 34:56.277
And, if you play
your cards right,

34:56.277 --> 34:58.163
The easy-open frontal assault.

35:22.071 --> 35:26.157
Isn't it sad when a family
has to suffer so much?

35:26.158 --> 35:28.226
Isn't it.

35:32.733 --> 35:34.099

35:39.072 --> 35:41.807

35:45.744 --> 35:48.079

but I think it's obvious

35:48.080 --> 35:50.081
I'm first in line.

35:50.082 --> 35:51.449
Not anymore.

35:58.758 --> 36:01.076
I don't wanna be. I am.

36:01.077 --> 36:03.913
Apparently you don't know
who I am.
No.

Ohh, you're a groupie.

36:18.210 --> 36:21.212
Yeah, well, I happen
to be a songwriter--

36:21.213 --> 36:22.247
Honey, you're not
a songwriter,

36:22.248 --> 36:24.249
You're a cheerleader.

Angel, baby,
good to see ya.

39:43.186 --> 39:45.187
I got a little surprise
for you.

39:45.188 --> 39:47.522
The boys would love
to see ya. Come on.
This way.

39:47.523 --> 39:49.524
Yeah, this way.
Come on, let's go.

39:49.525 --> 39:52.093
Goodbye, cheerleader.

39:52.094 --> 39:54.196
Ramones forever!

39:54.197 --> 39:56.331
Quit shoving, you guys.
Come on.

39:56.332 --> 39:58.966
stop cutting
in line!

40:19.155 --> 40:21.106
Well, you know
what they say.

40:21.107 --> 40:23.926
These things always happen
in threes.

40:23.927 --> 40:27.146
Oh, really?

40:27.147 --> 40:30.682
I want 100 of your best
Ramone tickets, please.

40:30.683 --> 40:32.417
$1,000.

40:34.120 --> 40:39.874
<i>(? "you're the best"</i>
<i>by the Paley brothers)</i>

40:39.875 --> 40:42.143
Here they are -
the Ramones tickets.

40:42.144 --> 40:44.779
There's many more of them.
You'll get one.

40:44.780 --> 40:45.781
There you go.

40:45.782 --> 40:48.968
All right,
I know you want one, too.

40:48.969 --> 40:50.686
What's all
this commotion?

40:50.687 --> 40:53.589
There you go.
Excuse me.
What's going on here?

40:53.590 --> 40:56.091
Here you go.
I'm giving out tickets
to the concert.

40:56.092 --> 40:57.527
The concert?
Yeah.

40:57.528 --> 41:00.362
I had no idea the students
were so interested in music.

41:00.363 --> 41:02.031
Wanna go?
Complimentary ticket?

41:02.032 --> 41:04.033
Why, thank you.
I love concerts.

41:04.034 --> 41:06.201
But, uh, who are
the "Ramoneys"?

41:06.202 --> 41:07.570
The Ramones.

41:07.571 --> 41:10.673
They're the best group
in the world...
...Oxygen.

41:14.445 --> 41:17.513
So, three members
of your family are dead?

41:17.514 --> 41:20.233
Oh, we know for a fact
that you are lying.

41:20.234 --> 41:22.419
Go and show her the proof.

41:22.420 --> 41:26.756
What do you have
to say for yourself?

41:26.757 --> 41:29.007
Hey, got better.
Got better nothing.

41:30.610 --> 41:32.878
I suppose that her parents
are still alive, too.

41:32.879 --> 41:36.682
Should I check on it,
ma'am?
No talking.

41:36.683 --> 41:41.487
Kate, I am really surprised
at you.

41:41.488 --> 41:44.940
I thought
you would serve as a model
for the rest of the school,

41:44.941 --> 41:47.526
Not as an accomplice
to delinquency.

41:47.527 --> 41:49.428
Well, she's my friend.

41:49.429 --> 41:53.216
A friend that will lead you
down the road to expulsion.

41:53.217 --> 41:55.685
I'm a teenage lobotomy.

41:55.686 --> 41:58.655
I have made a full report.

42:02.693 --> 42:06.813
Oh, Mr. Monitor, sir,
it's the breathing.
It's the...

42:06.814 --> 42:09.482
"you two girls
have done nothing but defy me,

42:09.483 --> 42:14.404
You have turned
the entire student body
against me..."

42:14.405 --> 42:17.241
Miss Randell, just what is
your problem?

42:19.511 --> 42:22.462
All right, who else has tickets
to this concert?

42:22.463 --> 42:24.398
Uh, just us.

42:24.399 --> 42:27.083
We're the only ones.

42:27.084 --> 42:30.320
Miss Togar, perhaps we're
taking this a bit too far.

42:30.321 --> 42:33.523
After all, the concert is on
their own time, and it's--

42:33.524 --> 42:36.560
Nonsense! They should
be made an example
for the whole school.

42:36.561 --> 42:39.930
All right,
give me your tickets.
I will give them to Charity.

42:39.931 --> 42:41.765
No way!
Very well.

42:41.766 --> 42:45.585
I'll have my hall monitors
take them from you.

42:45.586 --> 42:48.121
body search!

42:51.024 --> 42:52.792
Hey, Riff,
thank you.

42:52.793 --> 42:55.129
Thanks for the tickets,
Riff.

43:02.904 --> 43:05.573
Hey, Riff,
thanks for the ticket.

43:05.574 --> 43:08.076
Yeah, we couldn't
have gone without you,

43:08.077 --> 43:10.078
And everybody's
gonna be there.

43:10.079 --> 43:12.080
Yeah, we'll see you
there. Goodbye.

43:12.081 --> 43:13.948
Thanks.
Have a good time.

43:13.949 --> 43:15.549
We won't.

Ok, I hope I can remember

47:45.174 --> 47:46.675
Tom, you're nervous.

47:46.676 --> 47:50.077
Here, have a drink.
It'll calm you down.

47:50.078 --> 47:51.546
Thanks.

47:51.547 --> 47:54.149
Hey, and whatever you do,
don't worry.

47:54.150 --> 47:56.651
Since Riff lost her tickets
to the concert,

47:56.652 --> 47:58.636
You can move right in.

47:58.637 --> 48:00.538
She'll be a pushover.

48:00.539 --> 48:03.874
Besides, look how far
you've come in three days.

48:03.875 --> 48:06.877
Yeah, but the question is
how far will she go tonight?

48:06.878 --> 48:12.215
"if the unknown is 'y'
and the binomial is 'x,'

48:12.216 --> 48:16.705
What is the function
of the equation 'z'?"

48:18.424 --> 48:20.175
Riff.

48:20.176 --> 48:22.260
Riff.

48:22.261 --> 48:24.796
Riff!
Huh? Uh...

48:24.797 --> 48:26.765
Oh, uh, the, uh,

48:26.766 --> 48:30.502
The, uh, major export
of Ecuador is kapok.

48:30.503 --> 48:33.871
Very good, but that's geography,
and this is calculus.

48:33.872 --> 48:35.039
Ooh, sorry.

48:35.040 --> 48:37.675
Look at your math book.
It looks brand new.

48:37.676 --> 48:39.794
I bet you've never
even opened it.

48:39.795 --> 48:42.897
I only use it
on special equations.

48:44.266 --> 48:47.335
Oh, I don't feel like
studying tonight.

48:47.336 --> 48:49.588
Yeah, I've gotta
get home, anyway.

48:49.589 --> 48:52.258
I'm expecting Tom
to call me tonight.

48:52.259 --> 48:54.527
You really like him,
don't you?

48:54.528 --> 48:57.263
Mm-hmm. I've been seeing
a lot of him lately.

48:57.264 --> 48:58.531
You have?
Mm-hmm.

48:58.532 --> 49:00.532
Eaglebauer says we were made
for one another.

49:00.533 --> 49:01.799
Oh, he did?

49:01.800 --> 49:04.835
I think tonight
could be pretty special.

Hello.

49:08.774 --> 49:09.974
She's on the line.

49:09.975 --> 49:11.809
Great. Just remember
what I told you.

49:11.810 --> 49:15.680
Yeah. Hello. Hello, Riff?

49:15.681 --> 49:18.449
Hi. It's Tom.

49:18.450 --> 49:21.804
Tom?
<i>Yeah, Tom Roberts.</i>
<i>Football player?</i>

49:21.805 --> 49:22.955
No.

49:22.956 --> 49:25.090
I talk about
the weather a lot.

49:25.091 --> 49:29.144
Oh, yeah. Hey, Kate,
it's Tom Roberts on the phone.

49:29.145 --> 49:31.280
Tom? Why would he
call me here?

49:31.281 --> 49:32.782
So how's it been?

49:32.783 --> 49:34.233
Oh.

49:34.234 --> 49:36.034
<i>Little dry lately.</i>

49:36.035 --> 49:39.738
Yeah,
but I hear it's raining
cats and dogs in Idaho.

49:39.739 --> 49:44.442
Yes. Yes! Oh, man,
it's goin' great.

49:44.443 --> 49:46.478
Great.

49:46.479 --> 49:49.648
Listen, I'm just lying here
in my new van,

49:49.649 --> 49:51.834
On my beautiful waterbed,

49:51.835 --> 49:54.571
Listening to the Ramones'
brand-new album

49:54.572 --> 49:57.372
On this fantastically
expensive stereo

49:57.373 --> 50:01.477
Wondering if you'd like to maybe
go out tonight and get drunk?

50:01.478 --> 50:03.312
All right.

50:03.313 --> 50:06.031
Listen, I really wish
you'd reconsider-- what?

50:06.032 --> 50:08.233
Sure, I'll go out
with you tonight.

50:08.234 --> 50:10.903
You can't do that.
He's mine.

50:10.904 --> 50:12.154
You will?

50:12.155 --> 50:15.091
<i>Just find a date</i>
<i>for Kate, ok?</i>

50:15.092 --> 50:20.529
Great, I will. Listen,
I'll pick you both up
in about an hour.

50:20.530 --> 50:22.231
We got it!

50:22.232 --> 50:24.399
Riff, how can you
go out with him?

50:24.400 --> 50:27.971
I never thought about Tom
until you mentioned him.

50:27.972 --> 50:29.472
What?!

50:29.473 --> 50:31.574
It'd be a change for me,
don't you think?

50:31.575 --> 50:35.679
I never went in much
for the jock type.
Oh, cut it out.

50:35.680 --> 50:38.548
What about me?
What about tonight?

50:38.549 --> 50:41.601
Don't worry. You'll
be in the back seat
with Eaglebauer.

50:41.602 --> 50:44.521
He's lots of fun.

50:44.522 --> 50:46.957
I don't wanna have fun.
I wanna be with Tom.

50:46.958 --> 50:51.127
 hey,
I'm only kidding, Kate.

50:51.128 --> 50:55.497
I wouldn't do that
to you, huh?

50:55.498 --> 50:57.499
I'll take care of Eaglebauer.

50:57.500 --> 51:00.337
You can have Tom
all to yourself.

51:00.338 --> 51:02.873
Hmm?
Shouldn't kid like that,
Riff.

51:02.874 --> 51:04.875
shouldn't
kid like that.

51:04.876 --> 51:07.643
You know how hot I am
for him.
Hot?

51:07.644 --> 51:09.712
Yes, hot.
Whoa.

51:09.713 --> 51:13.216
"hot," off the lips of Kate.
My goodness. Ha-ha.

51:13.217 --> 51:16.119
Ha-ha, we did it!
We did it.

51:16.120 --> 51:19.122
I got you a date
with Kate. Whoo-hoo.

51:19.123 --> 51:20.891
Hot equals Joey Ramone.

51:20.892 --> 51:23.793
No, hot equals Tom.
Ehh.

51:23.794 --> 51:27.697
Aw, I can't believe it.
I can't believe it was
that easy.

51:27.698 --> 51:31.468
He looks like a little cherub
or something. Looks like
he's gonna fly away to Heaven.

51:31.469 --> 51:34.388
He's so sweet-looking,
kinda like a cream puff.

51:34.389 --> 51:36.490
That's why I like him.

51:36.491 --> 51:39.193
I like Joey Ramone 'cause
he's tall and handsome.

51:39.194 --> 51:42.763
He looks like a poem to me.
A poem?

51:42.764 --> 51:46.317
We get them drunk,
we go in the back,
we hit the waterbed...

51:46.318 --> 51:48.319
We gotta take turns
in the back.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.753
All he eats is pizza.

51:50.754 --> 51:55.374
I just love the way
he holds the pizza
dripping above his mouth.

51:55.375 --> 51:58.077
He slithers and slides it
into his mouth.

51:58.078 --> 52:01.280
It's so sexy the way it...

52:01.281 --> 52:03.183
Gross.

52:03.184 --> 52:05.369
 ? questioningly

52:05.370 --> 52:08.422
<i>? her eyes looked at me...</i>

Quick, where's a phone?
Where's a phone?
We've gotta get to a phone!

Sorry, but you're

Oh, but tonight we were gonna be

54:17.354 --> 54:20.540
The only thing I'll ever lay
is a carpet.

54:20.541 --> 54:22.709
You can't take this
lying down.

54:22.710 --> 54:26.145
You gotta crash that concert,
grab her up into your arms.

54:26.146 --> 54:28.548
Love conquers all.

Kate, do you realize
they're all really brothers?

56:00.024 --> 56:03.360
Imagine being the only sister
in the Ramones' family.

56:03.361 --> 56:06.196
we want the Ramones!

56:06.197 --> 56:07.797
I'm so lovin' it!

56:07.798 --> 56:09.566
come out,
please, Joey!

56:09.567 --> 56:11.568
we want the Ramones.

56:19.009 --> 56:20.411
Hi, gang!

56:22.548 --> 56:24.848
This is
screamin' Steve Stevens

56:24.849 --> 56:27.085
Steamin' your way
over station 666

56:27.086 --> 56:29.454
With
<i>the screamin' Steve show.</i>

56:29.455 --> 56:32.056
oh, wow!

56:33.893 --> 56:36.092
We're comin' at ya,
alive and kickin',

56:36.093 --> 56:39.630
With the hottest band this side
of the iron curtain -

56:39.631 --> 56:40.881
The Ramones!

56:40.882 --> 56:43.350
you know it, Steve.

56:43.351 --> 56:46.186
we love you, Ramones!

56:46.187 --> 56:47.154
Dig it.

56:48.589 --> 56:52.092
But first, I'd like to
introduce the two winners

56:52.093 --> 56:53.995
Of the Charity ticket raffle

56:53.996 --> 56:57.048
Donated by the principal
of Vince Lombardi high!

56:57.049 --> 56:59.417
Togar eats it!

57:01.821 --> 57:06.458
Sister Maria Teresa
and sister Teresa Maria.

57:12.698 --> 57:15.583
Now, that's a step
in the right direction.

57:15.584 --> 57:18.820
And to keep this administration
moving forward,

57:18.821 --> 57:21.523
I've made a list
of new school policy,

57:21.524 --> 57:25.160
Which I would like
instituted immediately.

57:25.161 --> 57:27.730
Take this down.

57:27.731 --> 57:30.949
Girls - skirts
below their knees

57:30.950 --> 57:34.852
And boys' hair
above their collar.

57:34.853 --> 57:39.257
And I think it would be tidy
if they wore neckties.

57:40.326 --> 57:42.594
And lunch is to be cut down

57:42.595 --> 57:44.095
To half an hour

57:44.096 --> 57:48.566
Because I am doubling up
on silent study hall.

57:48.567 --> 57:53.021
Well, I think that
should teach them a lesson
in deportment.

57:53.022 --> 57:54.839
How do you spell that?

57:54.840 --> 57:58.077
D-e-portment.

57:58.078 --> 57:59.844
Now I want you to meet
the two winners

57:59.845 --> 58:02.681
Of the screamin' Steve
ticket contest -

58:02.682 --> 58:05.517
Riff Randell
and Kate Rambeau!

58:06.519 --> 58:08.687
yay, Riff!

58:08.688 --> 58:10.689
You're live
on the air, girls.

58:10.690 --> 58:13.958
Why don't you say a few words
to the folks at home? Go.

58:13.959 --> 58:17.262
On behalf of the students
from Vince Lombardi high
who are here tonight,

58:17.263 --> 58:19.531
I'd just like to say
one thing -

58:19.532 --> 58:23.785
Screw you, principal Togar.
We made it to the concert,
anyway! Yeah!

58:23.786 --> 58:29.208
Who says today's youth
has nothin' to say, huh?

58:29.209 --> 58:32.495
<i>(inaudible yelling) </i>

58:32.496 --> 58:35.681
Those girls have turned
the whole school against me.

58:35.682 --> 58:38.033
Hansel, Gretel.

58:38.034 --> 58:40.969
I want you to crash
that concert.

58:40.970 --> 58:44.189
I want Randell and Rambeau
brought back here immediately.

59:13.921 --> 59:16.656
So you're Kate Rambeau, huh?
Yeah.

59:16.657 --> 59:19.792
I just loved your latest
<i>scientific American.</i>

59:19.793 --> 59:21.494
Thanks.

59:21.495 --> 59:23.896
Hey, would you two
lovely ladies

59:23.897 --> 59:26.131
Like to see
screamin' Steve in action

59:26.132 --> 59:28.416
As he interviews
the Ramones?

59:28.417 --> 59:31.553
Oh, great. I know
just the questions to ask.

59:31.554 --> 59:33.556
That's beautiful, 'cause
I can't think of a thing.

59:33.557 --> 59:37.126
I've waited so long
to see them. I know
they're gonna love my songs.

59:37.127 --> 59:39.562
I can believe it.
Ya ready? Here we go.

59:40.797 --> 59:43.733
Hey, you wanna keep it down
out here?

59:43.734 --> 59:46.169
They're tuning up.
How'd you get in there?

59:46.170 --> 59:50.273
Professional secret.
What's this stuff?

59:50.274 --> 59:55.094
Stuff is gonna prove
to the Ramones that I can
write songs for them,

59:55.095 --> 59:57.096
So out of my way, dew drop.

59:57.097 --> 01:00:01.133
I'm sorry, but
the Ramones' manager,

01:00:01.134 --> 01:00:03.135
A personal
friend of mine,

01:00:03.136 --> 01:00:05.872
Put me in charge
of keeping everyone out.

01:00:05.873 --> 01:00:08.709
What's all the trouble,
Angel, baby, huh?

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.711
Screamin'.
Well...

01:00:10.712 --> 01:00:13.447
Good to see ya.
Long time, right?

01:00:13.448 --> 01:00:15.749
Uh, who are these two?

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:18.719
These are screamin' Steve's
contest winners.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.772
Oh, uh, sorry, girls,
you'll have to wait outside.

01:00:21.773 --> 01:00:23.773
Oh, man...
Can't we just watch?

01:00:23.774 --> 01:00:29.362
Angel dearest, why don't you
see these sweet young things
to their seats?

01:00:29.363 --> 01:00:33.133
We'll go ourselves,
thanks.

01:00:33.134 --> 01:00:35.735
It's gonna be ok. Yeah.

01:00:35.736 --> 01:00:38.839
Screamin', I was wondering
if you could give us
a little more airtime.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.841
I'm hittin' it
once an hour.

01:00:40.842 --> 01:00:42.776
You can do
a little better.

01:00:51.019 --> 01:00:53.487
Hey-ho, let's go!

01:00:53.488 --> 01:00:56.290

? I'm a teenage lobotomy

<i>(cheering) </i>

01:05:08.429 --> 01:05:11.464
That, Mrs. Rambeau,
is where your daughter is.

01:05:11.465 --> 01:05:13.367
<i>My daughter Kate?</i>

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:15.952
<i>I thought she was</i>
<i>in the basement</i>
<i>splitting protons.</i>

01:05:15.953 --> 01:05:18.972
Oh, just as I thought,

01:05:18.973 --> 01:05:22.909
Which is why I called
a special assembly
together tomorrow

01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:25.195
To deal with this crisis.

01:05:25.196 --> 01:05:29.033
I'm going to need
every parent's help, so...

01:05:29.034 --> 01:05:30.734
Listen carefully.

01:05:30.735 --> 01:05:32.486
1, 2, 3, 4.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.001
? well, I'm going out west
where I belong

01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:52.640
? where the days are short
and the nights are long

01:05:54.643 --> 01:05:57.311
? and I'll walk,
and they'll walk

01:05:57.312 --> 01:05:59.580
? and I'll twist,
and they'll twist

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:02.084
? and I'll shimmy,
and they'll shimmy...

01:06:02.085 --> 01:06:04.351
Kate, she stole
my songs.

01:06:04.352 --> 01:06:08.923
? we're out there having fun
in the warm California sun

01:06:08.924 --> 01:06:10.992
? well, I'm going out west,
out on the coast...

01:06:13.495 --> 01:06:15.513
Gimme those back!

01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:19.149
? and I'll walk

01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:21.619
? yeah, and I'll twist...

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:22.920
Excuse me.

01:06:22.921 --> 01:06:24.322
? and I'll shimmy

01:06:24.323 --> 01:06:27.291
? and I'll fly,
and they'll fly

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:32.062
? we're out there having fun
in the warm California sun

01:06:33.132 --> 01:06:34.333
Hey, Riff!

01:06:39.672 --> 01:06:41.573
She's got my songs.

01:06:41.574 --> 01:06:43.241
tackle her!
Tackle?

01:06:50.065 --> 01:06:53.067
? well, the girls are frisky
in old 'Frisco

01:06:55.271 --> 01:06:58.072
? a pretty little chick
wherever you go

01:06:58.073 --> 01:07:01.074
? oh, and I'll walk

01:07:01.075 --> 01:07:04.077
? yeah, and I'll twist...

01:07:04.078 --> 01:07:06.481
You can catch her, Tom!

01:07:06.482 --> 01:07:09.100

and they'll fly

01:07:09.101 --> 01:07:13.421

01:07:13.422 --> 01:07:16.158
? well, we're out there
having fun

01:07:16.159 --> 01:07:18.493
? in the warm
California sun ?

01:07:24.317 --> 01:07:26.618
? gabba gabba, we accept you,
we accept you, one of us

01:07:26.619 --> 01:07:29.221
? gabba gabba, we accept you,
we accept you, one of us

01:07:36.462 --> 01:07:38.714
Oh, shit.

01:07:38.715 --> 01:07:41.251
? I don't wanna be
a pinhead no more

01:07:41.252 --> 01:07:43.719
? I just met a nurse
that I could go for

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.589
? I don't wanna be
a pinhead no more

01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:48.958
? I just met a nurse
that I could go for

01:07:57.733 --> 01:07:58.667
Whoa.

01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:03.705
? I don't wanna be
a pinhead no more

01:08:03.706 --> 01:08:05.707
? I met a nurse
that I could go for

01:08:05.708 --> 01:08:08.577
? I don't wanna be
a pinhead no more

01:08:08.578 --> 01:08:10.613
? I met a nurse
that I could go for

01:08:12.149 --> 01:08:13.183
? oh

01:08:16.252 --> 01:08:19.854
Thank you, Tom. Oh, thank you
for saving my songs.

01:08:19.856 --> 01:08:22.325
I always knew you were
a terrific football player.

01:08:28.532 --> 01:08:30.399
? everyone's accusin' me

01:08:33.537 --> 01:08:35.404
? everyone's accusin' me

01:08:47.618 --> 01:08:49.520
Yay!

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.156
? I don't wanna be
a pinhead no more

01:08:52.157 --> 01:08:54.491
? I met a nurse
that I could go for

01:08:54.492 --> 01:08:57.327
? I don't wanna be
a pinhead no more

01:08:57.328 --> 01:08:59.395
? I met a nurse
that I could go for

01:09:01.096 --> 01:09:02.432
? yeah

01:09:42.273 --> 01:09:45.844
Joey, Joey, Joey!

01:09:45.845 --> 01:09:50.296
Tom? Tom. Tom,
are you all right?
Speak to me.

01:09:50.298 --> 01:09:52.866
Riff, my head.
Riff?

01:09:52.867 --> 01:09:55.919
I've just been handed this note.
It says, "dear Ramones,

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.939
"all my friends
from Vince Lombardi high
are here tonight.

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:01.475
"even though our principal
Miss Togar thinks you make
nothin' but noise,

01:10:01.476 --> 01:10:03.694
I think you're the greatest."

01:10:03.695 --> 01:10:07.514
Do you mean you
signed up with Eaglebauer
to be with me?

01:10:07.515 --> 01:10:09.416
Yes.

01:10:10.785 --> 01:10:14.154
Listen, I'm glad
you're not Riff.

01:10:14.155 --> 01:10:16.623
What do you say we become
friends, anyway?

01:10:18.176 --> 01:10:21.513
"please dedicate your next song
to my friends Tom and Kate.

01:10:21.514 --> 01:10:24.048
Love, your number one fan,
Riff Randell."

01:10:24.049 --> 01:10:26.268
Ok, this is for Tom and Kate,
from our number one fan.

01:10:26.269 --> 01:10:27.685
Yay!

01:10:27.686 --> 01:10:29.421

01:10:46.221 --> 01:10:48.722
? you know she makes
my life complete

01:10:48.723 --> 01:10:50.892
? and you know I told you so
aren't they great?

01:10:50.893 --> 01:10:53.461
? she's the one,
she's the one

01:10:53.462 --> 01:10:56.430
? yeah, yeah, she's my girl

01:10:56.431 --> 01:10:57.799
That's me.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.401
? yeah, yeah, she's my girl

01:11:02.371 --> 01:11:04.973

a girl like you

01:11:19.455 --> 01:11:23.242

I'll always love you

01:11:23.243 --> 01:11:26.645

? the best girl
in the whole wide world

01:12:01.547 --> 01:12:03.449
Back, back.

01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:05.851
? when I see her
on the streets

01:12:05.852 --> 01:12:07.953
? you know she makes
my life complete

01:12:07.954 --> 01:12:12.124
? and you know I told you so,
she's the one, she's the one

01:12:12.125 --> 01:12:13.625
? the one

Joey.

01:12:33.014 --> 01:12:35.548
Yay, Joey!

01:12:38.319 --> 01:12:40.585
I told you
you'd have a great time.

01:12:40.586 --> 01:12:42.187
I am.

01:12:42.188 --> 01:12:45.090
Maybe that's them
in there.
Oh, boy, we got 'em now.

01:12:46.759 --> 01:12:50.445
Have you seen two young
high school girls around?

01:12:50.446 --> 01:12:53.548
Yeah, I got 'em on me.

01:12:53.549 --> 01:12:56.184
body search!
Aah!

01:13:00.808 --> 01:13:02.942
Is he all right?

01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:05.445
Hey, pizza!
Great.

01:13:07.214 --> 01:13:11.117
What are you doing here?
These are my songs.

01:13:11.118 --> 01:13:13.720
I've been trying to get them
to you for the longest time.

01:13:13.721 --> 01:13:15.788
Hey, it's Riff Randell,
our number one fan.

01:13:15.789 --> 01:13:18.791
Oh, wow,
you remembered my name.

01:13:18.792 --> 01:13:22.262
This is the big time, girlie.
This is rock-'n'-roll.

01:13:22.263 --> 01:13:25.598
Yeah, well, this is
"rock 'n' roll high school."

01:13:25.599 --> 01:13:27.267
"rock 'n' roll high school"?

01:13:27.268 --> 01:13:29.369
Yeah, I wrote it for
Mr. Mcgree's music class,

01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:32.389
But I really wrote it
for you, Joey.

01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:35.192
Hey, pizza! It's great.
Let's dig in.

01:13:35.193 --> 01:13:37.594
Yeah, I want some.
Oh, thanks.

01:13:37.595 --> 01:13:41.465
How many times
do I have to tell you?
No pizza for you, Joey.

01:13:41.466 --> 01:13:44.033
More wheat germ
and riboflavin.

01:13:44.034 --> 01:13:46.069
Yeah, come on, Joey.
Eat. Good.

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:48.788
I'm gonna eat some myself.
Mmm. Mmm.

01:13:48.789 --> 01:13:51.207
Organic alfalfa sprouts.
Come on, Joey.

01:13:51.208 --> 01:13:54.544
Good. Mmm. Come on, eat, Joey.
Good boy. Yeah.

01:13:54.545 --> 01:13:57.580
Mama'll love ya. You like it,
huh? Huh? Good, yeah.

01:13:57.581 --> 01:13:59.983
Iron, niacin, b12.

01:13:59.984 --> 01:14:01.417
Grown from the earth.
Good...

01:14:01.418 --> 01:14:04.021
I'll cherish this moment
forever.

01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:06.390
This is how I like
to see you, my son.

01:14:06.391 --> 01:14:09.126
Ok. Ok, girlie, the boys'll
take a look at 'em

01:14:09.127 --> 01:14:10.928
And get back to you
tomorrow, huh?

01:14:10.929 --> 01:14:13.414
Yeah, we're gonna be in town
one more day,

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:16.100
And if we like 'em,
we'll come pay you
and Mr. Mcglibb a visit.

01:14:16.101 --> 01:14:18.669
Say hi to Vince
for us.
Oh, wow.

01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:22.607
This is the happiest day
of my life.

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:26.644
Gabba gabba, hey.

01:14:34.819 --> 01:14:37.605
And I say to you parents,

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:40.858
This high school
is a failure.

01:14:40.859 --> 01:14:44.328
The past semester
has been a black Mark

01:14:44.329 --> 01:14:48.499
On the proud tradition
of Vince Lombardi high.

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:53.404
Student Riff Randell alone
has disrupted classes...

01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:56.190
They can't say I haven't
contributed anything.

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:58.426
...And banded the students
against me

01:14:58.427 --> 01:15:01.846
To attend a concert
of the Ramones.

01:15:01.847 --> 01:15:04.148
Hey, yeah!
That's right.

01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:08.186
...That awful
rock and roll music.

01:15:08.187 --> 01:15:12.357
You see before you
my first major step

01:15:12.358 --> 01:15:15.761
In putting this school
back on the winning track.

01:15:15.762 --> 01:15:18.180
I give you...

01:15:18.181 --> 01:15:20.515
The final solution.

01:15:21.901 --> 01:15:23.901
Those are our records.

01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:26.405
Hey, gimme those.

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:33.361
And this is what we think
of the Ramones...

01:15:34.896 --> 01:15:37.532
we've gotta stop her!

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.834
Somebody stop her!
She can't do that!

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:41.069
hey!

01:15:48.928 --> 01:15:50.345
Miss Togar,

01:15:50.346 --> 01:15:53.765
I cannot stand by
and allow you to do this.

01:15:53.766 --> 01:15:55.551
Then stand aside,
Mr. Mcgree.

01:15:55.552 --> 01:15:57.502
Let me through.

01:15:57.503 --> 01:15:59.938
<i>(Eaglebauer)</i> she's
burning our records!
We gotta stop her!

01:15:59.939 --> 01:16:01.823
I'll get the hose.

01:16:08.281 --> 01:16:10.315
Togar!

01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:13.203
That's the last straw, Randell.

01:16:13.204 --> 01:16:14.887
Detention... For life!

01:16:14.888 --> 01:16:19.375
<i>(? "school's out"</i>
<i>by Alice Cooper)</i>

01:16:22.112 --> 01:16:26.299
<i>? school's out for Summer</i>

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:33.972
let's take the school.

01:16:33.973 --> 01:16:37.592
My darling Evelyn,
how I long for the feel
of your luscious thighs.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:40.779
See you later, Togar.
It's already fifth period.

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:44.066
she's gonna
call the cops.

01:16:44.067 --> 01:16:47.353
<i>? no more pencils</i>

01:16:47.354 --> 01:16:49.455
<i>? no more books... ?</i>

01:16:49.456 --> 01:16:52.575
Hey, come on, you guys.
Follow me into the school.

01:16:52.576 --> 01:16:57.697
I regret that I have
only one life to give
for rock-'n'-roll.

01:16:57.698 --> 01:17:01.334
You belong in school with us,
Mr. Mcgree. Come on.

01:17:01.335 --> 01:17:05.087
Things sure have changed
since we got kicked out
of high school.

01:17:05.088 --> 01:17:08.224
Oh. Where are you going?
To Mr. Mcgree's class.

01:17:08.225 --> 01:17:10.760
Well, I'm happy
to see some students
still are interested

01:17:10.761 --> 01:17:12.562
In their studies.

01:17:12.563 --> 01:17:14.564
We're not students.
We're the Ramones.

01:17:14.565 --> 01:17:18.235
Ramones? You're responsible
for making that horrible
rock-'n'-roll music?

01:17:18.236 --> 01:17:20.704
You turned the whole school
against me.

01:17:24.476 --> 01:17:26.676
Do your parents know
that you're Ramones?

01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:29.946
Come on in.

01:17:31.448 --> 01:17:33.716
yay, Ramones!

01:17:33.717 --> 01:17:35.651
kill the principal!

01:17:40.708 --> 01:17:43.726
Rock-'n'-roll high school
is on the air again.

01:17:46.096 --> 01:17:48.915
<i>(? "high school" by mc5) </i>

01:17:50.968 --> 01:17:52.770

<i>? kids want a little action</i>

01:17:56.274 --> 01:17:58.158
<i>? kids want a little fun</i>

01:17:58.159 --> 01:18:00.377
More exciting
than study hall.

01:18:00.378 --> 01:18:02.278
<i>? ...Have to get their kicks</i>

01:18:02.279 --> 01:18:03.880

01:18:16.811 --> 01:18:19.746
They're going to destroy
the school.

01:18:19.747 --> 01:18:21.248
I can't believe it.

01:18:21.249 --> 01:18:22.315
Whoo!

01:18:22.316 --> 01:18:23.650
Ooh...

01:18:23.651 --> 01:18:25.852

01:18:54.199 --> 01:18:57.968
Get down, Mcgree.
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

01:19:01.139 --> 01:19:02.707
surf's up.

01:19:02.708 --> 01:19:05.376
Call the national guard.
They're causing a riot.
These kids are--

01:19:05.377 --> 01:19:07.545
The national guard?

01:19:07.546 --> 01:19:09.547
But my children
are inside that school.

01:19:09.548 --> 01:19:10.515
Oh, dear.

01:19:13.151 --> 01:19:16.004

Hey! Wait!

01:19:52.691 --> 01:19:54.058
Wait, wait.

You're gonna
get it now, fat boys!

01:19:56.211 --> 01:19:58.446

Nice garters.

Firing line...
The Tuesday surprise!

01:20:22.872 --> 01:20:26.290
No, no, not

01:20:29.412 --> 01:20:31.062

and we'll bang your erasers.

01:21:02.846 --> 01:21:04.881
So what do you think
of my school, guys?

01:21:04.882 --> 01:21:07.183
Boy, when you have recess,
you really go all out.

01:21:07.184 --> 01:21:10.519
Consider yourselves
officially enrolled in
rock-'n'-roll high school.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:13.922
The facilities are yours.
Do whatever you want.

01:21:15.174 --> 01:21:18.209

and hold my hand?

01:21:18.210 --> 01:21:20.812

Go on, get out there!
Yeah!

<i>(cheering) </i>

01:23:18.332 --> 01:23:21.168
Attention!
Give it to me.

01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:22.936
Attention, students.

01:23:24.556 --> 01:23:25.890
attention, students.

01:23:25.891 --> 01:23:28.492
Hey, quiet!
Quiet, everybody! Listen!

01:23:28.493 --> 01:23:32.396
This is your principal -
Miss Evelyn Togar!

01:23:32.397 --> 01:23:35.132
I wanna speak
to Riff Randell.

01:23:35.133 --> 01:23:38.469
Quiet! Come on.
Into my office.

01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:40.504
I don't think
it's working.

01:23:40.505 --> 01:23:42.707
I know how to...
You don't think it's working?

01:23:42.708 --> 01:23:46.344
Start talking, Togar.
It's your dime.

01:23:46.345 --> 01:23:49.881
Ok, Randell. I know we've had
our differences in the past,

01:23:49.882 --> 01:23:52.717
But I think it's time we tried
to understand one another.

01:23:52.718 --> 01:23:55.203
I think the problem is clear.

01:23:55.204 --> 01:23:58.907
I am a reasonable,
well-educated, mature
adult member of society,

01:23:58.908 --> 01:24:04.111
And you are a spoiled
heathen punk who has
taken over my school.

01:24:13.788 --> 01:24:15.990
So let's make a deal.

01:24:15.991 --> 01:24:19.327
I can have you expelled
and turned over to the police.

01:24:19.328 --> 01:24:21.896
But I'm gonna
forget about that

01:24:21.897 --> 01:24:24.899
And just put one black Mark
on your permanent record

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:27.619
That will follow you throughout
the rest of your life...

01:24:29.805 --> 01:24:32.740
...If you'll just
come out of there right now.

01:24:35.928 --> 01:24:40.498
I don't think one more
black Mark is gonna make
too much of a difference.

01:24:40.499 --> 01:24:44.569
Eaglebauer, your partner,
comes through again.
All right.

01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:54.647
Here's what I think about
your school records, Togar!

01:24:54.648 --> 01:24:58.684
You handled that very well,
Miss Togar.

01:25:06.459 --> 01:25:08.759
What's that?

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:11.329
I don't know. I...

01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:13.264
Miss Togar!

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:29.181
Well, now they've done it.
Destroying government property.

01:25:29.182 --> 01:25:32.685
I think ya failed,
Miss Togar. I think we're
gonna have to do it my way.

01:25:32.686 --> 01:25:35.254
I think you're right.

01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:38.257
Randell, I just talked
to the chief of police.

01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:41.661
You're not out in five minutes,
he's going to Storm
the building.

01:25:41.662 --> 01:25:43.495
Well, you heard it, folks.

01:25:43.496 --> 01:25:46.732
Miss Togar has just
given the students
of rock-'n'-roll high

01:25:46.733 --> 01:25:48.067
An ultimatum.

01:25:48.068 --> 01:25:52.137
A classic confrontation
between mindless authority

01:25:52.138 --> 01:25:54.474
And the rebellious
nature of youth.

01:25:54.475 --> 01:25:57.743
The moment of truth
is at hand. What will
these kids do next?

01:26:19.866 --> 01:26:21.834
Boy, this sure is
rock-'n'-roll high school.

01:26:21.835 --> 01:26:24.738
Yeah, we liked it so much,
we're gonna play it
on our next album.

01:26:24.739 --> 01:26:28.541
To show our appreciation,
we're gonna make you
an honorary Ramone.

01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:37.367
Hey, guys, people say
that your music is loud

01:26:37.368 --> 01:26:40.254
And destructive
and lethal to mice,

01:26:40.255 --> 01:26:43.507
But I think you're
the Beethovens of our time.

01:26:43.508 --> 01:26:45.475
That was a good one,
Mr. Mcgree.

01:27:08.232 --> 01:27:10.567
Kate, is it a go?
It's a go.

01:27:10.568 --> 01:27:13.303
All right!
Everybody follow me.
We're gonna evacuate.

01:27:13.304 --> 01:27:15.722
I guess we should
rush the building.

01:27:17.558 --> 01:27:18.792
Not so fast. Look.

01:27:23.230 --> 01:27:24.397
They're coming out.

01:27:27.001 --> 01:27:28.401
It's over.

01:27:28.402 --> 01:27:30.204
We won.

01:27:31.090 --> 01:27:33.891
Ladies and gentlemen,
school is out.

01:27:33.892 --> 01:27:37.328
It appears as if the final bell
has rung for these students.

01:27:37.329 --> 01:27:39.797
Has Riff Randell given up?

01:27:39.798 --> 01:27:41.966
Has she and her
fellow classmates

01:27:41.967 --> 01:27:45.002
Failed Miss Togar’s
final exam?

01:27:45.003 --> 01:27:47.738
Is this the end
of rock-'n'-roll high?

01:27:47.739 --> 01:27:51.141
Just what do you
have to say for yourself,
young lady?

01:27:51.142 --> 01:27:54.444
I have seen the errors
of my ways.

01:27:54.445 --> 01:27:58.581
I'd just like to say
to all students everywhere

01:27:58.582 --> 01:28:01.920
That you may think the school
is yours for a while,

01:28:01.921 --> 01:28:05.990
But it's always
run by the principal
and her administration.

01:28:05.991 --> 01:28:07.425
That's nice.

01:28:07.426 --> 01:28:09.994
Vince Lombardi high is...

01:28:09.995 --> 01:28:13.381
Is your school, Miss Togar,

01:28:13.382 --> 01:28:15.316
So you can have it.

01:28:15.317 --> 01:28:18.636
Well, I'm very happy to see
that you've come to your senses.

01:28:18.637 --> 01:28:20.939
And what would you have done
with the school, anyway?

01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:24.225
Rock the roof off it.
Hit it, Marky!

01:28:26.628 --> 01:28:31.332
? rock, rock, rock, rock,

01:28:31.333 --> 01:28:34.636

? I just wanna have some kicks

01:28:44.464 --> 01:28:46.965
