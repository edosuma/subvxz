♪♪

00:09.510 --> 00:11.310
Why are we back down here
in the hole?

00:11.312 --> 00:13.512
Maybe, if we remember
where we came from,

00:13.514 --> 00:15.214
we'll appreciate
how far we've come.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.483
That's real deep. You miss
watching the shoes, don'tcha?

00:17.485 --> 00:19.018
So much.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.719
Like 'em!

00:20.721 --> 00:23.188
Riles, it's possible that
these here high schoolers

00:23.190 --> 00:25.324
may not appreciate your
delightful quirkiness.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.658
But you do.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.293
Yes.

00:28.295 --> 00:29.928
(gasps) Love 'em!

00:31.298 --> 00:33.399
You're better
than that, Naomi.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.037
People don't like it
when you give them good advice.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.340
Wanna know what
we're gonna do now?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.375
We're gonna go to class now.
That's how embarrassed I am.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.979
You're right. Academics are
the number one priority
in high school.

00:46.981 --> 00:48.013
(phone beeps)

00:48.015 --> 00:49.815
He's breaking up
with me by text?

00:49.817 --> 00:51.083
Who does that?

00:51.085 --> 00:52.251
Who does that?

00:52.253 --> 00:53.485
Who does that?

00:53.487 --> 00:56.889
(many phones beeping)

00:56.891 --> 01:01.160
Methinks it's possible
high school isn't only
about our studies.

01:01.162 --> 01:05.064
Is it just me,
or is everybody up here a tad
on the dramatic side today?

01:05.066 --> 01:07.433
Aah!

01:07.435 --> 01:10.402
(crying loudly)

01:15.876 --> 01:21.613
(plays Jazz saxophone)

01:21.615 --> 01:23.115
-Somewhere safe?
-Let's run.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.953
(girls sobbing)

01:33.794 --> 01:35.461
You knew
Jake and I used to date.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.196
I did know it.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.399
I actually went after him
just for that reason.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.633
I didn't even like him.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.137
I just wanted
to make you feel bad.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.442
(girl crying)
This stall is taken

01:50.444 --> 01:52.244
for my emotions.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.780
What is going on here?

01:54.782 --> 01:57.816
It's Breakup Monday,
you two baby butterflies.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.385
Butterflies.
She knows us, Maya.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.720
Who you calling butterflies?

02:01.722 --> 02:03.922
We are proud
middle-school survivors.

02:03.924 --> 02:07.025
Middle school. A clear lake
of untroubled spring water.

02:08.896 --> 02:13.098
High school is a bathroom
full of these train-wrecks.

02:13.100 --> 02:17.469
Is it just me,
or is everybody up here a tad
on the dramatic side today?

02:17.471 --> 02:20.472
Aah!

02:20.474 --> 02:21.974
Oh, she's here.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.911
You seem very wise.
What is your name?

02:25.913 --> 02:28.647
-I'm Sage.
-Oh, come on.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.482
What's Breakup Monday, Sage?

02:30.484 --> 02:34.419
In high school, you'll start
going to Friday night parties.

02:34.421 --> 02:37.089
Someone will smile at you,
you'll smile back,

02:37.091 --> 02:38.323
you are in love.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.358
Love is forever.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.425
Love is till Monday.

02:40.427 --> 02:41.793
Who hurt you?

02:41.795 --> 02:43.362
Why Monday?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.998
So everyone can have
a full week of drama
until the next party.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.534
-Why?
-Because they love that more.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.669
(sobbing) Alan!

02:51.772 --> 02:54.473
Yeah. Alan!

02:54.475 --> 02:56.275
Why would anybody love this?

02:56.277 --> 02:58.844
We would never put ourselves
in a position of drama.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.479
Explain your current situation.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.014
-I like a boy.
-I like the same boy.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.048
Your friendship is over.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.383
That could never
happen to us.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.484
Why not?

03:05.486 --> 03:07.352
Because there's
no friendship like ours.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.388
I can't believe we were
ever best friends.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.323
But we are
best friends, Peaches.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.491
-Thunder!
-No!

03:12.493 --> 03:15.394
Stupid rings are for stupid
girls who haven't grown up.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.795
Well, I've grown up.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.064
-(splash)
-Girl: Nice shot.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.832
I wish I never knew you.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.268
I wish you never crawled
through my bedroom window.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.707
Well, that could be anybody.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.877
-Thunder!
-Lightning!

03:33.347 --> 03:34.813
Yeah, this ain't
about the weather.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.415
You like the same boy.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.749
You have to make a decision.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.449
I'm never going back in there.
I don't care what happens.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.618
Farkle and I have let this
go on too long.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.053
It's 'cause your pain is
hilarious to us.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.821
But we're not gonna lose each
other over this.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.490
What if someone gets hurt?

04:51.492 --> 04:54.459
Oh, somebody's getting hurt.
But I've been saying all along,

04:54.461 --> 04:56.295
if you guys aren't gonna be
honest with each other,

04:56.297 --> 04:57.329
everybody gets hurt.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.898
(bell rings)

04:59.900 --> 05:01.099
Yay, school's over.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.501
Nope, we have art class.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.635
That's the one I like.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.803
That's the one
that likes you.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.837
What's the one I don't like?

05:05.839 --> 05:06.905
All of the other ones.

05:06.907 --> 05:07.973
That's the one.

05:13.247 --> 05:15.247
Art class. This is you, Maya.

05:15.249 --> 05:17.249
Today, we finish our
first paintings,

05:17.251 --> 05:19.685
and Mr. Jackson gets to see
how talented you are.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.119
I hope so, Riles.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.688
-And you, too.
-No.

05:22.690 --> 05:26.625
I'm just hoping
to create a positive
working relationship with him.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.026
What is that, a cat?

05:29.330 --> 05:30.629
And it's over.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.030
The assignment was to paint

05:32.032 --> 05:33.665
a photorealistic
representation...

05:33.667 --> 05:35.600
-Uh-huh, uh-huh.
-...of the benches
in Central Park.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.802
Nothing changes.

05:36.804 --> 05:37.836
You painted a cat.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.971
-The cat's on a bench!
-I don't see the bench.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.407
I will cut my ear off
right now.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.977
Well, I admire
your passion, Ms. Matthews.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.714
If I'm any kind of a teacher,
I'll get you to keep both
your ears,

05:48.716 --> 05:51.616
and I will teach you there's
a world beyond purple cats.

05:51.618 --> 05:52.651
Stop it.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.686
Besides, art is not my thing.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.821
Art is her thing.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.422
Take a look at that.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.093
Yeah.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.763
That is not who you are.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.699
I mean, what is that, splotches?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.801
You threw some paint
on there, did you?

06:09.803 --> 06:11.703
What is this supposed
to be, I wonder?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.338
"What is this supposed
to be, I wonder?"

06:13.340 --> 06:14.906
Is that how you
address genius?

06:14.908 --> 06:17.676
I painted what I'm feeling.
What's wrong with that?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.544
What's wrong with it
is I don't know what
you're trying to say.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.346
What are you trying to say?

06:21.348 --> 06:23.081
-I don't know.
-I think you do.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.050
-What are you trying to say?
-She has plenty to say.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.386
Good, start talking.
Why'd you deviate
from the assignment?

06:27.388 --> 06:28.987
I-- I didn't mean to.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.757
Of course she meant to.
Maya does what Maya wants.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.393
Maya does what Maya wants
because she's a true artist.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.628
Why'd you pick that bench?

06:38.732 --> 06:39.831
I don't know. I just did.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.033
Well, clearly,
it influenced you.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.568
What are your
influences, Ms. Hart?

06:43.570 --> 06:45.270
Why are you
the way you are?

06:46.673 --> 06:48.673
When I look at this picture,
this is what comes out.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.708
I'm sorry you don't like it.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.677
What? Maya, no,
you're not sorry.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.379
Since when have you
been sorry about anything?

06:54.381 --> 06:57.749
Mr. Jackson, she's a rebel,
and you're going to love her.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.185
Ms. Matthews, I'm sure
Ms. Hart can speak for herself.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.554
Come on.
Who are your influences?

07:02.556 --> 07:05.590
-What do you mean?
-Artists have influences.

07:05.592 --> 07:09.060
Sometimes those influences
can help them to discover
their own unique voice.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.296
And sometimes those influences,

07:11.298 --> 07:12.764
eh, turn you into a copycat.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.933
Maya isn't
influenced by anybody.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.935
-Are you?
-Whatever you say.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.304
Uh-huh. Because...

07:19.306 --> 07:22.774
you'll never be a true artist
unless you're true to yourself.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.775
So, who are you?

07:25.646 --> 07:27.646
She dances on teachers' desks,

07:27.648 --> 07:28.814
she's the queen of detention,

07:28.816 --> 07:30.649
she's the president
of Mayaville.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.384
Yeah, remember that?

07:32.386 --> 07:34.619
Yeah, Maya, that seems
like a long time ago.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.521
It does.

07:37.724 --> 07:40.459
Maybe, I don't know
who I am yet.

07:40.461 --> 07:43.929
Well, you're gonna need to know
if you want to succeed
in this class, understood?

07:43.931 --> 07:46.131
Maya has always known
who Maya is.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.266
Yeah? I can't tell from this.

07:48.268 --> 07:52.170
Because of that, I'm not gonna
give it a grade right now.

07:52.172 --> 07:56.475
I'm gonna call it... incomplete.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.844
'Cause that's what
this says about you.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.291
What just happened in art?

08:13.293 --> 08:15.660
Forget that. We need
to figure out this Lucas thing.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.662
Forget that, we need
to figure out this Maya thing.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.499
What-- There's no
Maya thing. I'm the same
Maya I've always been.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.468
The Maya you've always been
would take nothing from nobody.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.037
He went after your art.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.706
Maya, your art
is who you are.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.307
The guy went after who you are.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.610
Do you think it should just
be us who decides about Lucas?

08:31.612 --> 08:34.012
Why do you keep on changing
the subject? The subject is you.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.680
Because I think that Lucas
should decide too.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.682
I think it should be all of us.

08:38.819 --> 08:39.918
I'm going to take Lucas.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.487
-What?
-What are you
gonna do about it?

08:42.489 --> 08:44.356
I liked him first,
he's my boyfriend,

08:44.358 --> 08:46.458
and I don't think
that you should have
anything to do with him.

08:46.460 --> 08:47.792
What are you gonna
do about that?

08:47.794 --> 08:49.895
Now that I've heard you say it,
do you think I've been selfish?

08:49.897 --> 08:50.962
What?

08:52.799 --> 08:54.633
You can't have him, he's mine.

08:54.635 --> 08:55.867
What are you gonna
do about that?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.802
I don't want you
to think of me like that.

08:57.804 --> 09:01.339
I think of you as somebody
who would never let me say
what I'm saying to you!

09:01.341 --> 09:04.376
I think of you as somebody
who would fight for what
she believed in.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.313
Even me. Especially fight me.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.385
Maya, if you like Lucas,
then you're gonna have
to take him from me.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.387
-You'd let me?
-No!

09:15.389 --> 09:16.888
No, I wouldn't!
You know why?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.256
Because you taught me that.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.091
You taught me that.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.993
-Maya.
-Yeah?

09:21.995 --> 09:23.028
Where are you?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.729
What?

09:24.731 --> 09:25.931
Where did you go?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.741
How am I supposed to choose
between two people I care about?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.176
You have to.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.045
Well, how do I live with
myself if I hurt Riley or Maya?

09:40.047 --> 09:41.379
I know who I'd choose.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.747
You've thought
about this before?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.950
-Yeah.
-I don't want you
thinking about it.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.818
Then I won't.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.690
Okay, stop.
Who would you choose?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.725
-Riley.
-You would?

09:53.727 --> 09:56.728
I like Riley. I'd choose Riley
and I'd be happy with Riley.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.563
-You would?
-Yes.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.931
Decision over, it's Riley.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.935
Or... I'd choose Maya.

10:03.937 --> 10:04.869
What?

10:04.871 --> 10:06.304
Yeah, yeah, I like Maya.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.872
I'd choose Maya
and I'd be happy with Maya.

10:07.874 --> 10:08.974
Okay, what's going on?

10:08.976 --> 10:11.293
Farkle, you get a reading?

10:11.294 --> 10:13.611
No significant difference
in facial expression
or tone of voice.

10:13.614 --> 10:14.879
He has actually
not made a decision yet.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.948
There may be no
scientific way to do this.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.650
I have a way.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.118
How do you have a way
if I don't have a way?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.387
Because I know it will
upset you, so I have a way.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.788
-And it's good.
-Okay, well, what is it?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.158
You're gonna let
jelly beans decide my future?

10:27.160 --> 10:29.961
Oh, who else is supposed
to decide your future, you?

10:31.765 --> 10:33.498
Okay.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.266
Let's start with personality.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.801
Which girl makes you laugh?

10:36.803 --> 10:40.005
Oh, okay, well, Riley's
the goofiest person I know.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.773
She makes me laugh
50 times a day.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.108
(whistles)

10:43.110 --> 10:46.144
But, I also laugh
when Maya "hu-hurrs" me

10:46.146 --> 10:48.346
and calls me "Huckleberry"
50 times a day.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.916
Which girl would you rather
have a deep conversation with?

10:51.918 --> 10:53.251
That night in the library
with Riley.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.487
I could have sat there
talking with her forever.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.691
But then, there was Maya
and that campfire.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.595
All right, we need
a deciding question.

11:03.597 --> 11:05.964
Something deep and meaningful
and reveals your true soul.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.600
Which girls makes you
feel "bluoylalaloo"?

11:08.602 --> 11:10.135
-No.
-Yes.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.936
-Why?
-I need to hear you say it.

11:11.938 --> 11:12.971
Riley?

11:12.973 --> 11:14.005
Bloylalaloo.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.040
Not even close.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.875
-Maya?
-Bloylalaloo.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.443
You have to mean it,
for real.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.811
How do they make you feel?

11:19.813 --> 11:21.846
Lucas, think about
both of them. Riley and Maya.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.883
Bloylalaloo!

11:28.955 --> 11:31.056
I never want to do that again.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.993
Look, I don't believe
in coincidence.

11:34.995 --> 11:39.397
I believe coincidence
is the universe's way
of telling you something.

11:39.399 --> 11:43.868
And what are the odds
that one day on the subway
Riley falls into my lap?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.370
It's always been Riley.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.206
It's always been
Riley since day one.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.876
-So, you're decided.
-Yeah.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.646
-Except...
-What?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.916
...it was Maya who pushed her.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.219
It was Maya who did that
for Riley because that's
who Maya is.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.058
Okay then. Good experiment.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.426
Except this isn't
about jelly beans.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.228
It's about us, Lucas.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.864
All right, this decision could
change who we all are together.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.833
So, make it
a good one, all right?

12:14.835 --> 12:17.068
Lucas, I know it's impossible
to choose between both
of them.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.871
I mean, I couldn't.
But you have to.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.607
For the good
of all of us. Choose.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.282
Fix her!

12:31.284 --> 12:32.350
I don't need to be fixed.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.451
-You know who says that?
-Who?

12:33.453 --> 12:35.053
Somebody who needs to be fixed.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.087
Fix her!

12:36.089 --> 12:37.355
What's wrong with her?

12:37.357 --> 12:39.057
She's been getting
good grades,

12:39.059 --> 12:40.191
she's behaving
all over the place.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.526
What is that?

12:41.528 --> 12:43.795
Well, we like to believe

12:43.797 --> 12:46.064
that we've helped contribute
to the perfectly civilized

12:46.066 --> 12:48.967
lovely young lady we see
sitting before us.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.469
It's Maya.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.973
Oh, yeah. We broke her.

12:57.878 --> 13:01.246
Yeah, I shouldn't be here.
This is about my daughter.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.947
I need you to look at them.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.753
Yeah, okay, look.
Whatever this is,

13:08.755 --> 13:11.055
it is awfully kind of you
to pretend you need me,

13:11.057 --> 13:12.323
but she has you!

13:12.325 --> 13:14.159
You have the best.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.628
Okay, see you in a month.
Don't forget to eat.

13:16.630 --> 13:17.929
Uh, sit down.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.165
Right. See how good they are?

13:20.167 --> 13:21.733
I wish they'd
take me in, too.

13:22.736 --> 13:23.802
We've got a problem.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.136
I see twins.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.139
Why is that a problem?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.741
We only raise Rileys.

13:29.743 --> 13:32.010
Katy, I need you to be
a strong parent here--

13:32.012 --> 13:34.412
Ha! Sorry.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.816
Okay. Can you play
a strong parent?

13:37.818 --> 13:41.052
I'm gonna cast you
in the role of "strong parent."

13:46.159 --> 13:47.258
Maya...

13:49.496 --> 13:50.562
That's all I've got.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.432
Is there more than one line?
I never get more than one line.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.000
Do you have a script?

13:56.002 --> 13:57.468
It's an improv.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.204
-Go.
-Ooh. Oh, man. All right.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.206
Uh, someone yell out a place.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.307
North Pole!

14:02.309 --> 14:03.675
What are you doing?

14:03.677 --> 14:05.510
I wanna see
what she does with it.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.180
Oh, gee.

14:09.182 --> 14:13.184
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to get you very many toys, Maya.

14:14.487 --> 14:17.021
And I realize that Santy Claus
and his family

14:17.023 --> 14:18.623
live right down
the street here

14:18.625 --> 14:22.293
and they have all the toys
in the world, dont'cha know.

14:22.295 --> 14:26.731
And they'd be only too happy
to give them all to you,
you betcha.

14:26.733 --> 14:30.034
But you're not supposed
to be there all the time.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.836
-Why not?
-Cory!

14:31.838 --> 14:34.205
Well, why shouldn't she
be allowed to visit?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.507
-Has she been
a good little girl?
-Cory!

14:36.509 --> 14:38.643
Oh, I think she's
a better little girl

14:38.645 --> 14:40.011
when she visits you, yeah.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.413
Then she should be allowed
to visit all the time.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.382
Oh-ho! Me too!

14:45.418 --> 14:47.085
(clapping)

14:47.087 --> 14:50.054
Katy, you really are
very good, you know that?

14:50.056 --> 14:52.357
Oh... Tell somebody.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.892
How was I?

14:53.894 --> 14:55.927
You were you.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.362
Thanks.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.364
You... have not been you.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.498
Come back.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.035
Guys, you've always
been there for me.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.370
I'm a teenager.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.105
No teenager
knows who they are.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.240
Maya, I know who you are.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.076
Even your art teacher
says that this isn't you.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.078
Wait a second,
you're having a problem in art?

15:14.080 --> 15:15.413
How is that possible?

15:15.415 --> 15:19.250
Well, he said that he wanted
to know who her influences were.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.285
People change people.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.620
Secret of blah blah blah.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.123
And those influences help you
become who you are.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.624
It's why we choose
our friends carefully.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.861
And good influences
are only good influences

15:29.863 --> 15:31.296
when they help you
find you.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.398
-I am me.
-Yeah?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.099
What'cha wearing, you?

15:35.101 --> 15:37.268
-You love what I'm wearing.
-Of course I love what
you're wearing, Maya.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.937
I'm wearing it, too.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.316
Ever since I can remember,

15:51.318 --> 15:53.718
I've always wanted to be you.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.453
Why?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.288
Because.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.091
You were always stronger
than me, and now you
just proved it.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.726
How?

16:01.728 --> 16:05.296
Maya, I only talked about it,
but you actually did it.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.968
You became me.

16:13.139 --> 16:17.308
Riley, just because I'm wearing
an outfit similar to yours

16:17.310 --> 16:18.676
doesn't make me you.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.744
Hair.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.513
Just because I'm wearing my hair
like you today

16:22.515 --> 16:24.282
-it doesn't make me you.
-Maya.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.017
Clothes and hair, big deal!

16:26.019 --> 16:28.453
Name me one thing of real
significance that you and I
share in common

16:28.455 --> 16:30.922
that has to do with
the inside, that affects
us emotionally?

16:30.924 --> 16:33.291
(singing to herself)
La, la, la...

16:33.293 --> 16:35.026
Why are you--
Why are you doing that?

16:35.028 --> 16:36.761
'Cause you can't get
past hair and clothes, can you?

16:36.763 --> 16:39.497
Riley, I'm me! I've always
been me, I'm always gonna be me!

16:39.499 --> 16:41.199
Nothing's gonna change that!

16:41.201 --> 16:42.367
Lucas.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.002
La...

16:46.539 --> 16:47.705
It's not just Lucas.

16:47.707 --> 16:51.025
What, there's more?

16:51.026 --> 16:54.344
Maya, you haven't stood on
a teacher's desk or been in
detention for a long time.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.048
You sold your house
in Mayaville and you
moved to Rileytown.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.516
-I must like it.
-Go home.

16:58.518 --> 17:02.320
What's wrong with us both
liking a nice guy?

17:02.322 --> 17:03.888
Do we?

17:05.291 --> 17:07.392
What's wrong with who I am now?

17:07.394 --> 17:10.895
Maya, the world has one of me,

17:10.897 --> 17:12.463
the world needs one of you.

17:12.465 --> 17:16.367
My voice is still
my voice, Riley.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.971
You're gonna need to show me
a lot more than clothes
and hair and a boy

17:19.973 --> 17:21.205
before I believe that it isn't.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.878
You want me to go home?

17:28.415 --> 17:29.714
I'll go home.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.229
Monet's<i> Water Lilies.</i>

17:45.231 --> 17:47.265
One of the great works
of impressionism.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.200
But when you stand here...

17:49.202 --> 17:51.269
All you see
are splotches of paint.

17:51.271 --> 17:55.073
As you begin to step back...

17:57.844 --> 17:59.877
Masterpiece.

17:59.879 --> 18:03.414
A painting can sometimes
be recognized for what
it truly is

18:03.416 --> 18:04.882
by a change in perspective.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.451
This may also
be true with people.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.386
I owe you
an apology, Ms. Hart.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.754
Everybody does.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.657
Took another
look at your piece.

18:14.027 --> 18:16.594
Your work is absolutely
saying something.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.163
And when I took
a step back...

18:24.737 --> 18:27.071
You haven't lost your voice.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.440
You're screaming, Ms. Hart.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.109
Maya...

18:32.579 --> 18:36.280
Look... it-- it's a purple cat.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.325
-She's me.
-I know.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.227
I always wanted to be her,
and now she's me.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.295
-I know.
-Nobody ever
gets what they want.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.396
I know.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.066
We have our share
of blame for this.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.601
Nobody is to blame for this.

18:56.603 --> 18:59.770
I've only ever benefited
from the things you guys
have taught me.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.239
I'm lucky to know you.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.775
Ma, they messed me up.

19:04.777 --> 19:08.012
Yeah, I know, babygirl.
I gotta pay attention.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.116
Once you start painting
purple cats,

19:12.118 --> 19:13.918
-can you ever get out?
-No.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.521
I'm her. I'm gone.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.590
That's too bad.

19:19.592 --> 19:23.161
I've always looked forward
to seeing who the real Maya Hart
turns out to be.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.629
So have I.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.497
You gonna take that
away from us?

19:31.938 --> 19:33.337
Thunder.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.008
Lightning.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.075
Help me.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.645
What's going on?

19:40.647 --> 19:42.280
We're sneaking out.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.347
I'm so proud of you.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.450
-Where are you going?
-Who knows?

19:46.452 --> 19:47.485
Okay.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.420
-No!
-No!

19:51.491 --> 19:52.557
Yes.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.409
Where do you
think they're going?

20:11.411 --> 20:13.544
I think they're
on an adventure

20:13.546 --> 20:15.513
to help my daughter
find her voice.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.747
Oh, good. An adventure.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.082
Were we invited?

20:18.084 --> 20:19.150
No.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.552
How come I never
get invited to nuttin'?

20:22.422 --> 20:23.921
I made my decision!

20:27.427 --> 20:30.027
What are you doing in my house?

20:30.029 --> 20:33.164
I came through the window with
a big, important announcement.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.900
But no one was there.
Where are they?

20:35.902 --> 20:38.603
They're gone. Forget 'em.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.937
Tell us.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.005
No!

20:42.442 --> 20:44.809
Sit down and spill it, Chuckie!

20:54.520 --> 20:56.721
Okay.

20:56.723 --> 20:57.989
Here's who I picked.
