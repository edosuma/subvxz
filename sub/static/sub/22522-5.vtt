<i>Martians.</i>

00:53.316 --> 00:57.013
<i>Why so many speculations</i>
<i>and fantasies about Martians...</i>

00:57.220 --> 01:01.350
<i>... rather than Saturnians, say,</i>
<i>or Plutonians?</i>

01:01.558 --> 01:04.925
<i>Because Mars seems,</i>
<i>at first glance, very Earth-like.</i>

01:05.128 --> 01:07.688
<i>It's the nearest planet</i>
<i>whose surface we can see.</i>

01:07.897 --> 01:10.764
<i>There are polar icecaps,</i>
<i>drifting white clouds...</i>

01:10.967 --> 01:14.198
<i>... raging dust storms,</i>
<i>seasonally changing patterns...</i>

01:14.404 --> 01:15.928
<i>... even a 24-hour day.</i>

01:16.139 --> 01:20.303
<i>It's tempting to think of it</i>
<i>as an inhabited world.</i>

01:21.745 --> 01:25.579
<i>Mars has become</i>
<i>a kind of mythic arena...</i>

01:25.782 --> 01:30.048
<i>... onto which we've projected</i>
<i>our earthly hopes and fears.</i>

01:30.253 --> 01:33.814
<i>The most tantalizing myths</i>
<i>about Mars have proved wrong.</i>

01:34.023 --> 01:37.288
<i>So a few people have swung</i>
<i>to the opposite extreme...</i>

01:37.494 --> 01:40.463
...and concluded that
the planet is of little interest.

blues for the Red Planet.

01:44.267 --> 01:47.361
But the real Mars is
a world of wonders.

01:47.570 --> 01:51.370
Its future prospects are
far more intriguing...

01:51.574 --> 01:53.804
...than our past apprehensions
about it.

In our time, we have sifted
the sands of Mars...

01:57.881 --> 01:59.815

02:00.016 --> 02:03.213
...and fulfilled a century of dreams.

02:08.892 --> 02:13.261

<i>was that of H.G. Wells...</i>

02:13.463 --> 02:18.093

<i>... by intelligences</i>
<i>greater than man's...</i>

02:30.280 --> 02:32.840

04:17.720 --> 04:21.156

(CLAPPING)

04:50.954 --> 04:53.286

04:53.489 --> 04:57.050
<i>... some of the mental habits</i>
<i>of those departed days.</i>

04:58.628 --> 05:00.755
<i>At most, terrestrial men fancied...</i>

05:00.964 --> 05:05.230
<i>... there might be other men upon Mars,</i>
<i>perhaps inferior to themselves...</i>

05:05.435 --> 05:08.404

(CHEERING)

05:42.205 --> 05:45.470
SAGAN: <i>Wells' novel captured</i>
<i>the popular imagination...</i>

05:45.675 --> 05:47.905
<i>... in the late Victorian era.</i>

05:48.111 --> 05:51.171
<i>This was a time when</i>
<i>the automobile was a novelty...</i>

05:51.381 --> 05:52.848
<i>... when the pace of life...</i>

05:53.049 --> 05:55.643
<i>... was still determined</i>
<i>by the speed of the horse.</i>

05:55.852 --> 06:00.016
<i>Into this world, Wells introduced</i>
<i>an interplanetary fantasy...</i>

06:00.356 --> 06:04.452
<i>... with spaceships, ray guns</i>
<i>and implacable aliens.</i>

06:04.661 --> 06:08.825
<i>These were original</i>
<i>and disquieting possibilities.</i>

06:11.834 --> 06:14.098
<i>The Martians of H.G. Wells...</i>

06:14.303 --> 06:17.932
<i>... were not merely minor variations</i>
<i>on a human theme.</i>

06:18.141 --> 06:21.167
<i>Instead, they were</i>
<i>the evolutionary product...</i>

06:21.377 --> 06:24.676
<i>... of a totally alien environment.</i>

06:32.989 --> 06:36.083
<i>Forty years later,</i>
<i>this fantasy was still able...</i>

06:36.292 --> 06:40.729
<i>... to frighten millions</i>
<i>in war-jittery America...</i>

06:40.930 --> 06:44.957
<i>... when it was dramatized for radio</i>
<i>by the young Orson Welles.</i>

06:52.341 --> 06:55.208
<i>A few years before</i>
The War of the Worlds <i>was published...</i>

06:55.411 --> 06:57.675
<i>... another, quite different</i>
<i>vision of Martians...</i>

06:57.880 --> 07:00.178
<i>... was forming in the mind</i>
<i>of a wealthy Bostonian...</i>

07:00.383 --> 07:02.408
<i>... named Percival Lowell.</i>

07:04.887 --> 07:07.856
<i>The Martians of H.G. Wells</i>
<i>were a way for the novelist...</i>

07:08.057 --> 07:11.823
<i>... to examine contemporary society</i>
<i>through alien eyes.</i>

07:12.028 --> 07:15.964
<i>But the Martians of Percival Lowell</i>
<i>were, he believed...</i>

07:16.165 --> 07:17.723
<i>... very real.</i>

07:21.771 --> 07:26.231
It was here that
the most elaborate claims...

07:26.442 --> 07:29.809
...in support of life on Mars
were developed.

07:33.883 --> 07:37.910
Lowell dabbled in astronomy
as a young man.

07:43.092 --> 07:45.720
He went off to Harvard.

07:48.865 --> 07:52.562
He had a semiofficial
diplomatic appointment to Korea...

07:55.271 --> 07:57.762
...and otherwise engaged
in the usual pursuits...

07:57.974 --> 08:00.374
...of the wealthy for his time.

08:01.310 --> 08:04.211
But his lifelong love...

08:04.580 --> 08:07.276
...was the planet Mars.

08:08.718 --> 08:11.209
Lowell was electrified...

08:11.420 --> 08:14.480
...by the announcement in 1877...

08:14.690 --> 08:17.750
...by an Italian astronomer,
Giovanni Schiaparelli...

08:17.960 --> 08:20.986
...of <i>canali</i> on Mars.

08:21.631 --> 08:24.065
Schiaparelli had reported...

08:24.267 --> 08:27.134
...during a close approach
of Mars to the Earth...

08:27.336 --> 08:30.999
...an intricate network of
single and double straight lines...

08:31.207 --> 08:35.234
...crisscrossing
the bright areas of Mars.

08:37.246 --> 08:40.875
Now, <i>canali</i> in Italian
means "channels" or "grooves"...

08:41.083 --> 08:45.315
...but it was promptly translated
into English as canals...

08:45.521 --> 08:48.490
...a word which understandably has...

08:48.691 --> 08:51.626
...a certain implication
of intelligent design.

08:52.061 --> 08:56.157
A Mars-mania swept through
Europe and America...

08:56.365 --> 09:00.096
...and Percival Lowell found
himself caught up in it.

09:01.804 --> 09:05.103
In 1892, his eyesight failing...

09:05.308 --> 09:09.972
...Schiaparelli announced
he was giving up observing Mars.

09:11.781 --> 09:15.182
Lowell resolved
to continue the work.

09:16.719 --> 09:18.880
(ROOF CREAKS)

09:21.190 --> 09:24.284
He wanted
a first-rate observing site...

09:24.660 --> 09:28.221
...undisturbed by clouds
or city lights...

09:28.431 --> 09:30.490
...and marked by good seeing.

09:30.700 --> 09:34.534
"Seeing" is the astronomer's term
for a steady atmosphere...

09:34.737 --> 09:38.036
...through which the shimmering
of an astronomical image...

09:38.241 --> 09:40.072
...in the telescope is minimized.

09:47.583 --> 09:51.075
Lowell built his observatory
far away from home...

09:51.287 --> 09:56.156
...on Mars Hill,
here in Flagstaff, Arizona.

10:12.842 --> 10:17.211
Lowell sketched
the surface features of Mars...

10:17.914 --> 10:21.816
...and particularly the canals,
which mesmerized him.

10:22.151 --> 10:25.712
Now, observations of this sort
aren't easy.

10:25.922 --> 10:28.413
You put in long hours
at the telescope...

10:28.624 --> 10:30.683
...in the chill of the early morning.

10:30.893 --> 10:33.691
Most of the time,
the seeing is crummy.

10:33.896 --> 10:35.693
When the seeing is bad...

10:35.898 --> 10:38.867
...the image of Mars
blurs and distorts...

10:39.068 --> 10:41.559
...and you have to ignore
what you've observed.

10:41.771 --> 10:46.071
But occasionally the image steadies
and the features of the planet...

10:46.275 --> 10:49.335
...marvelously flash out at you.

10:49.545 --> 10:51.604
You must then remember
what you've seen...

10:51.814 --> 10:53.873
...and accurately commit it to paper.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.574
You must put
your preconceptions aside...

10:56.786 --> 10:59.619
...and with an open mind,
set down the wonders...

10:59.822 --> 11:02.222
...that Mars holds in store for us.

11:02.425 --> 11:06.020
This is Percival Lowell's
own notebook.

11:06.228 --> 11:08.788
Here's what he thought he saw.

11:09.799 --> 11:13.667
Bright and dark areas,
a hint of a polar cap...

11:13.936 --> 11:17.394
...and canals.
Lots and lots of canals.

11:23.179 --> 11:24.646
Lowell believed...

11:25.247 --> 11:29.877
...that he was seeing
a globe-girdling network...

11:30.086 --> 11:32.554
...of great irrigation canals...

11:32.755 --> 11:35.622
...carrying water
from the melting polar caps...

11:35.825 --> 11:38.953
...to the thirsty inhabitants
of the equatorial cities.

11:39.528 --> 11:42.190
He believed
the planet was inhabited...

11:42.398 --> 11:44.525
...by an older and wiser race...

11:44.734 --> 11:47.396
...perhaps very different from us.

11:47.603 --> 11:48.695
He believed...

11:48.904 --> 11:51.998
...that the seasonal changes
in the dark areas...

11:52.208 --> 11:55.666
...were due to the growth
and decay of vegetation.

11:55.878 --> 11:59.143
He believed that
the planet was Earth-like.

12:01.517 --> 12:04.645
<i>All in all, he believed too much.</i>

12:15.097 --> 12:18.760
<i>Lowell's Martians were a dying race.</i>

12:18.968 --> 12:22.199
<i>Their once-great cities</i>
<i>had fallen into ruins.</i>

12:22.405 --> 12:25.499
<i>Lowell believed that</i>
<i>the Martian climate was changing...</i>

12:25.708 --> 12:28.905
<i>... that the precious water</i>
<i>was trickling away into space...</i>

12:29.111 --> 12:32.478
<i>... that the planet</i>
<i>was becoming a desert world.</i>

12:32.681 --> 12:36.617
<i>The canals, he thought,</i>
<i>were a last desperate measure...</i>

12:36.819 --> 12:41.483
<i>... a heroic engineering effort</i>
<i>to conserve the scarce water.</i>

12:41.690 --> 12:45.524
<i>But their technology, although</i>
<i>far more advanced than ours...</i>

12:45.728 --> 12:50.062
<i>... was inadequate to stem</i>
<i>a planetary catastrophe.</i>

13:35.044 --> 13:38.673
<i>The most serious contemporary</i>
<i>challenge to Lowell's ideas...</i>

13:38.881 --> 13:40.610
<i>... came from an unlikely source:</i>

13:40.816 --> 13:43.478
<i>The biologist Alfred Russel Wallace...</i>

13:43.686 --> 13:46.678
<i>... co-discoverer of evolution</i>
<i>by natural selection.</i>

13:46.889 --> 13:49.915
<i>Wallace correctly showed</i>
<i>that the air on Mars...</i>

13:50.126 --> 13:52.287
<i>... was much too cold and thin...</i>

13:52.495 --> 13:54.759
<i>... to permit the existence</i>
<i>of liquid water.</i>

13:54.964 --> 13:58.627
<i>He wrote that</i>
<i>"only a race of madmen...</i>

13:58.834 --> 14:01.769
<i>... would build canals</i>
<i>under such conditions."</i>

14:03.873 --> 14:07.604
Lowell's Martians
were benign and hopeful...

14:07.810 --> 14:09.641
...even a little godlike...

14:09.845 --> 14:12.507
...very different
from the malevolent menace...

14:12.715 --> 14:17.243
...posed by H.G. Wells and Orson
Welles in <i>The War of the Worlds.</i>

14:17.553 --> 14:21.182
Both sets of ideas passed
into the public imagination...

14:21.390 --> 14:24.188
...through Sunday supplements
and science fiction...

14:24.593 --> 14:28.757
...and excited generations
of 8-year-olds into fantasizing...

14:28.964 --> 14:31.956
...that they themselves
might one day voyage...

14:32.168 --> 14:34.193
...to the distant planet Mars.

15:48.744 --> 15:50.006
...myself among them...

<i>Goddard would later attend.</i>

18:31.907 --> 18:35.638
<i>The images of Mars spun</i>
<i>by Wells and Lowell...</i>

18:35.844 --> 18:38.108
<i>... beguiled the young Goddard...</i>

18:39.515 --> 18:41.176
<i>... and at age 17...</i>

18:41.383 --> 18:43.908
<i>... on October 19, 1899...</i>

18:44.119 --> 18:46.952
<i>... they crystallized</i>
<i>into an overwhelming vision...</i>

18:47.156 --> 18:51.149
<i>... that provided the direction</i>
<i>and purpose of his life.</i>

18:58.133 --> 18:59.862
<i>From the high branches...</i>

19:00.068 --> 19:03.265
<i>... of an old cherry tree</i>
<i>on his family's farm...</i>

19:03.472 --> 19:08.341
<i>... Goddard saw a way to do more</i>
<i>than just speculate about Mars.</i>

19:17.052 --> 19:19.520
<i>Before anyone had ever flown</i>
<i>in an airplane...</i>

19:19.721 --> 19:21.780
<i>... or listened to a radio...</i>

19:21.990 --> 19:25.357
<i>... Goddard decided</i>
<i>to invent a machine...</i>

19:25.561 --> 19:29.122
<i>... that would voyage</i>
<i>to the planet Mars.</i>

20:01.063 --> 20:04.555
<i>For the rest of his life, he was</i>
<i>to commemorate that October day...</i>

20:04.766 --> 20:07.257
<i>... as his anniversary day...</i>

20:07.469 --> 20:10.267
<i>... the birthday of his great dream.</i>

20:14.877 --> 20:19.075
<i>By the 1920s, after years of</i>
<i>studying physics and engineering...</i>

20:19.281 --> 20:23.217
<i>... he was experimenting</i>
<i>with liquid fuel rockets.</i>

20:36.365 --> 20:39.732
<i>In order to build a rocket capable</i>
<i>of reaching high altitudes...</i>

20:39.935 --> 20:44.133
<i>... Goddard had to create the principles</i>
<i>of an entirely new technology.</i>

20:44.339 --> 20:46.398
<i>He invented the basic components...</i>

20:46.608 --> 20:49.008
<i>... that propel, stabilize...</i>

20:49.211 --> 20:51.702
<i>... and guide the modern rocket.</i>

21:09.131 --> 21:11.964
<i>It was painstaking and difficult work.</i>

21:12.167 --> 21:15.432
<i>But Goddard took</i>
<i>the many setbacks in stride.</i>

21:18.540 --> 21:21.008
<i>He sifted the wreckage</i>
<i>of each experiment...</i>

21:21.209 --> 21:23.677
<i>... for clues to guide the next.</i>

21:25.847 --> 21:29.544
<i>Constantly refining old techniques</i>
<i>and inventing new ones...</i>

21:29.751 --> 21:34.154
<i>... he gradually raised the rocket</i>
<i>from a dangerous toy...</i>

21:34.523 --> 21:38.186
<i>... and set it on its way to becoming</i>
<i>an interplanetary vehicle.</i>

21:50.405 --> 21:53.306
<i>Goddard died in 1945...</i>

21:53.508 --> 21:55.999
<i>... before a rocket had ever</i>
<i>left the planet Earth.</i>

21:56.211 --> 21:58.611
<i>Although Mars always</i>
<i>remained his objective...</i>

21:58.814 --> 22:01.874
<i>... Goddard knew that such a goal</i>
<i>would be ridiculed.</i>

22:02.084 --> 22:06.282
<i>In public he advocated</i>
<i>the more modest objective...</i>

22:06.488 --> 22:08.820
<i>... of flying to the moon.</i>

22:13.362 --> 22:17.093
<i>Those boyhood dreams of voyages</i>
<i>to the moon and Mars...</i>

22:17.299 --> 22:19.859
<i>... shared by Goddard</i>
<i>with his contemporary...</i>

22:20.068 --> 22:23.469
<i>... a Russian scientist named</i>
<i>Konstantin Tsiolkovsky...</i>

22:23.672 --> 22:28.006
<i>... were fulfilled only</i>
<i>a few decades after their deaths.</i>

22:28.210 --> 22:32.442
<i>But as it turned out, the first</i>
<i>planet to be explored by rocket...</i>

22:32.648 --> 22:33.945
<i>... was the Earth.</i>

22:43.859 --> 22:45.884
<i>Now, imagine yourself a visitor...</i>

22:46.094 --> 22:48.722
<i>... from some other</i>
<i>and quite alien planet.</i>

22:48.930 --> 22:51.626
<i>You approach the Earth</i>
<i>with no preconceptions.</i>

22:51.833 --> 22:55.325
<i>Is the place inhabited?</i>
<i>At what point can you decide?</i>

22:55.537 --> 22:58.631
<i>When we look at the whole Earth,</i>
<i>there are no signs of life.</i>

22:58.840 --> 23:01.434
<i>We must examine it more closely.</i>

23:01.643 --> 23:05.238
<i>If there are intelligent beings,</i>
<i>maybe they create structures...</i>

23:05.447 --> 23:08.473
<i>... which can be seen at</i>
<i>a resolution of a few kilometers.</i>

23:08.684 --> 23:10.777
<i>Yet at this level of detail...</i>

23:10.986 --> 23:14.387
<i>... even a great river valley</i>
<i>seems utterly lifeless.</i>

23:14.923 --> 23:16.550
<i>There is no sign of life...</i>

23:16.758 --> 23:19.420
<i>... intelligent or otherwise</i>
<i>in Washington, D. C...</i>

23:20.762 --> 23:22.229
<i>... or Moscow...</i>

23:24.533 --> 23:26.057
<i>... or Tokyo...</i>

23:27.436 --> 23:28.334
<i>... or Peking.</i>

23:28.537 --> 23:31.836
<i>If there are intelligent beings,</i>
<i>they have not much modified...</i>

23:32.040 --> 23:35.908
<i>... the landscape into geometrical</i>
<i>patterns at kilometer resolution.</i>

23:36.111 --> 23:39.080
<i>But when we improve</i>
<i>the resolution tenfold...</i>

23:39.281 --> 23:42.307
<i>... when we see detail</i>
<i>as small as 100 meters across...</i>

23:42.517 --> 23:44.144
<i>... the size of a football field...</i>

23:44.352 --> 23:46.252
<i>... the situation changes.</i>

23:50.892 --> 23:54.726
<i>Many places on Earth seem suddenly</i>
<i>to crystallize out...</i>

23:54.930 --> 23:58.457
<i>... revealing an intricate pattern</i>
<i>of straight lines...</i>

23:58.667 --> 24:02.626
<i>... squares, rectangles and circles.</i>

24:07.209 --> 24:10.975
<i>Canals, roads,</i>
<i>circular irrigation patterns...</i>

24:11.179 --> 24:14.148
<i>... all suggest intelligent life</i>
<i>with a passion...</i>

24:14.349 --> 24:17.716
<i>... for Euclidean geometry</i>
<i>and territoriality.</i>

24:17.919 --> 24:21.218
<i>On this scale,</i>
<i>intelligent life can be discerned.</i>

24:21.423 --> 24:22.549
<i>Boston...</i>

24:23.725 --> 24:25.488
<i>... and Washington...</i>

24:27.629 --> 24:28.687
<i>... and New York.</i>

24:28.897 --> 24:33.095
<i>At 10-meter resolution, we also</i>
<i>discover that the Earthlings...</i>

24:33.301 --> 24:35.166
<i>... like to build up.</i>

24:38.874 --> 24:41.843
<i>At twilight or night,</i>
<i>other things are visible:</i>

24:42.043 --> 24:44.671
<i>Oil well fires in the Persian Gulf...</i>

24:45.046 --> 24:47.640
<i>... or the bright lights</i>
<i>of large cities.</i>

24:48.884 --> 24:51.944
<i>At a meter resolution,</i>
<i>we make out individual organisms:</i>

24:52.154 --> 24:54.520
<i>Seals on ice floes...</i>

24:55.423 --> 24:57.687
<i>... or people on skis.</i>

25:00.862 --> 25:04.298
<i>Intelligent life on Earth</i>
<i>first reveals itself...</i>

25:04.499 --> 25:08.060
<i>... through the geometric regularity</i>
<i>of its constructions.</i>

25:08.270 --> 25:11.296
<i>If Lowell's canal network existed,</i>
<i>the conclusion that...</i>

25:11.506 --> 25:15.465
<i>... intelligent beings inhabit</i>
<i>that planet might be compelling.</i>

25:15.677 --> 25:18.111
<i>But there is no canal network.</i>

25:18.313 --> 25:21.339
<i>Our unmanned spacecraft</i>
<i>have examined Mars...</i>

25:21.550 --> 25:24.110
<i>... with 1000 times more detail...</i>

25:24.319 --> 25:28.619
<i>... than any fleeting glimpse available</i>
<i>through Percival Lowell's telescope.</i>

25:28.824 --> 25:32.692
<i>There is no question that his Martian</i>
<i>canals were of intelligent origin.</i>

25:32.894 --> 25:34.384
<i>The only question was...</i>

25:34.596 --> 25:37.929
<i>... which side of the telescope</i>
<i>the intelligence was on.</i>

25:38.133 --> 25:42.763
<i>Where we have strong emotions,</i>
<i>we are liable to fool ourselves.</i>

25:42.971 --> 25:47.305
<i>Yet even without the canals,</i>
<i>the exploration of Mars evokes...</i>

25:47.509 --> 25:49.670
<i>... the kind of rapture that...</i>

25:49.878 --> 25:53.006
<i>... Columbus or Marco Polo</i>
<i>must have felt.</i>

25:55.884 --> 25:57.852
<i>We see many impact craters...</i>

25:58.053 --> 26:01.853
<i>... but we find no canals.</i>
<i>None at all.</i>

26:02.724 --> 26:04.954
<i>There are fault lines</i>
<i>in the surface...</i>

26:05.160 --> 26:08.857
<i>... and complex patterns</i>
<i>of ridges and valleys...</i>

26:09.064 --> 26:12.522
<i>... but they're all far too small</i>
<i>and in the wrong places...</i>

26:12.734 --> 26:14.463
<i>... to be Lowell's canals.</i>

26:14.669 --> 26:17.729
<i>And they don't seem</i>
<i>to be manufactured.</i>

26:19.374 --> 26:21.001
<i>There are many signs of water.</i>

26:21.209 --> 26:24.872
<i>Ancient river valleys wind</i>
<i>their way among the craters.</i>

26:25.080 --> 26:28.208
<i>Nergal Valley, named</i>
<i>after the Babylonian war god...</i>

26:28.416 --> 26:32.580
<i>... is 1000 kilometers long</i>
<i>and a billion years old.</i>

26:32.787 --> 26:34.618
<i>There seems to have been a time...</i>

26:34.823 --> 26:37.986
<i>... when Mars was warmer</i>
<i>and wetter than it is today.</i>

26:39.194 --> 26:42.027
<i>I wonder if life ever arose...</i>

26:42.230 --> 26:46.929
<i>... in the muddy backwaters</i>
<i>of these great river systems.</i>

26:48.103 --> 26:50.401
<i>The waters flowed at the same time...</i>

26:50.605 --> 26:54.598
<i>... that the great volcanoes</i>
<i>of the Tharsis Plateau were made.</i>

26:55.243 --> 26:59.304
<i>Before the present continents</i>
<i>of Earth were formed...</i>

26:59.514 --> 27:02.915
<i>... it was a very lively epoch on Mars.</i>

27:04.619 --> 27:06.883
<i>Equally old is the Mariner Valley...</i>

27:07.088 --> 27:10.455
<i>... a strange, vast, mist-filled chasm.</i>

27:10.659 --> 27:15.289
<i>If it were on Earth, it would stretch</i>
<i>from New York to Los Angeles.</i>

27:15.497 --> 27:19.126
<i>Landslides and avalanches</i>
<i>are slowly eroding its walls...</i>

27:19.334 --> 27:21.495
<i>... which collapse</i>
<i>to the floor of the valley.</i>

27:21.703 --> 27:24.536
<i>There, the winds remove</i>
<i>the particles...</i>

27:24.739 --> 27:27.765
<i>... and create immense</i>
<i>sand dune fields.</i>

27:29.244 --> 27:31.610
<i>Signs of high winds are all over Mars.</i>

27:31.813 --> 27:34.543
<i>Often craters have,</i>
<i>trailing behind them...</i>

27:34.749 --> 27:39.083
<i>... long streaks of bright or dark</i>
<i>material, blown out by the winds...</i>

27:39.287 --> 27:43.280
<i>... natural weather vanes</i>
<i>on the Martian surface.</i>

27:43.658 --> 27:46.593
<i>For the sand to be blown about</i>
<i>in the thin Martian atmosphere...</i>

27:46.795 --> 27:48.422
<i>... the winds have to be fast...</i>

27:48.630 --> 27:52.225
<i>... sometimes approaching</i>
<i>half the speed of sound.</i>

27:53.034 --> 27:56.800
<i>But some of the patterns</i>
<i>are so odd and intricate...</i>

27:57.005 --> 28:00.532
<i>... that we cannot be sure</i>
<i>they're caused by windblown sand.</i>

28:00.742 --> 28:04.405
<i>And there are other strange markings:</i>

28:04.612 --> 28:06.944
<i>Furrowed ground, almost resembling...</i>

28:07.148 --> 28:10.208
<i>... a giant plowed field</i>
<i>a billion years old...</i>

28:10.418 --> 28:13.683
<i>... and one of the strangest</i>
<i>features on Mars...</i>

28:13.888 --> 28:16.152
<i>... the pyramids of Elysium...</i>

28:16.358 --> 28:18.986
<i>... 10 times taller</i>
<i>than the pyramids of Egypt.</i>

28:19.194 --> 28:22.425
<i>Perhaps they're only mountains</i>
<i>sculpted by the fierce winds...</i>

28:22.630 --> 28:25.599
<i>... but perhaps they're something else.</i>

28:34.943 --> 28:39.346
<i>How marvelous it would be</i>
<i>to glide over the surface of Mars...</i>

28:39.547 --> 28:42.141
<i>... to fly over Olympus Mons...</i>

28:42.350 --> 28:45.285
<i>... the largest known volcano</i>
<i>in the solar system.</i>

28:48.089 --> 28:50.148
<i>The surface area of Mars</i>
<i>is exactly...</i>

28:50.358 --> 28:52.883
<i>... as large as</i>
<i>the land area of the Earth.</i>

28:53.094 --> 28:57.053
<i>It will be a long time before</i>
<i>this planet is thoroughly explored.</i>

28:57.732 --> 29:01.566
<i>The only canal of Percival Lowell</i>
<i>that corresponds to anything real...</i>

29:01.770 --> 29:03.601
<i>... is Mariner Valley.</i>

29:04.539 --> 29:06.530
<i>5000 kilometers long...</i>

29:06.741 --> 29:08.971
<i>... it's a little hard</i>
<i>to miss even from Earth.</i>

29:09.177 --> 29:11.737
<i>The Grand Canyon</i>
<i>of Arizona would fit...</i>

29:11.946 --> 29:14.506
<i>... into one of its minor tributaries.</i>

29:14.716 --> 29:18.550
<i>Someday we will careen</i>
<i>through the corridors...</i>

29:18.753 --> 29:21.984
<i>... of the Valley of the Mariners.</i>

30:19.080 --> 30:22.641
<i>To skim over</i>
<i>the sand dunes of Mars is...</i>

30:22.851 --> 30:25.547
<i>... as yet, only a dream.</i>

30:38.399 --> 30:40.333
<i>But we have, in fact...</i>

30:40.535 --> 30:43.595
<i>... sent robot emissaries to Mars.</i>

30:43.805 --> 30:46.740
<i>Their names are</i> Viking 1...

30:46.975 --> 30:48.738
<i>... and</i> Viking 2.

30:49.477 --> 30:52.503
<i>The problem was where to land them.</i>

30:54.549 --> 30:58.451
<i>We knew that the volcanoes</i>
<i>of Tharsis were too high.</i>

30:58.653 --> 31:00.587
<i>The thin Martian atmosphere</i>
<i>would not...</i>

31:00.788 --> 31:03.552
<i>... support our descent parachute.</i>

31:03.758 --> 31:08.092
<i>The great Mariner Valley was</i>
<i>too rough and unpredictable.</i>

31:09.397 --> 31:11.422
<i>The polar caps were too cold...</i>

31:11.633 --> 31:14.625
<i>... for the lander's nuclear</i>
<i>power plant to keep it warm.</i>

31:14.969 --> 31:18.735
<i>There were fascinating places</i>
<i>that were too high...</i>

31:18.940 --> 31:21.966
<i>... or too windy</i>
<i>or too hard or too soft...</i>

31:22.177 --> 31:24.577
<i>... or too rough or too cold.</i>

31:25.346 --> 31:28.281
<i>We worried about the safety</i>
<i>of every landing site.</i>

31:28.483 --> 31:30.951
<i>Perhaps we were too cautious.</i>

31:31.152 --> 31:33.552
<i>Eventually we selected two places.</i>

31:33.755 --> 31:37.213
<i>One, optimistically named Utopia...</i>

31:37.425 --> 31:38.949
<i>... for</i> Viking 2...

31:39.160 --> 31:42.129
<i>... and another,</i>
<i>8000 kilometers away...</i>

31:42.330 --> 31:46.232
<i>... not far from the confluents</i>
<i>of four great channels...</i>

31:46.434 --> 31:48.459
<i>... a landing site for</i> Viking 1...

31:48.670 --> 31:50.968
<i>... called Chryse...</i>

31:51.406 --> 31:54.534
<i>... Greek for "the land of gold."</i>

32:00.315 --> 32:04.251
<i>And so, after a voyage</i>
<i>of 100 million kilometers...</i>

32:04.452 --> 32:07.012
<i>... on July 20, 1976...</i>

32:07.222 --> 32:09.952
...Viking 1 <i>landed right on target...</i>

32:10.158 --> 32:11.819
<i>... in the Chryse Plain.</i>

32:14.462 --> 32:17.363
<i>It was less than 80 years</i>
<i>since Robert Goddard...</i>

32:17.565 --> 32:19.123
<i>... had his epiphanic vision...</i>

32:19.334 --> 32:22.531
<i>... in a cherry tree in Massachusetts.</i>

32:34.015 --> 32:38.247
<i>After hibernating for a year</i>
<i>during its interplanetary passage...</i>

32:38.453 --> 32:42.014
...Viking <i>reawakened on another world.</i>

32:44.359 --> 32:46.725
<i>The first thing it did</i>
<i>was to call home...</i>

32:46.928 --> 32:49.590
<i>... reporting a safe arrival.</i>

32:50.865 --> 32:53.299
<i>It began to rouse itself...</i>

32:53.501 --> 32:56.163
<i>... according to instructions</i>
<i>memorized earlier.</i>

32:56.371 --> 33:00.364
<i>First, it put out a finger</i>
<i>to test the Martian winds.</i>

33:00.942 --> 33:03.410
<i>Then, flexing its arm...</i>

33:03.611 --> 33:06.842
<i>... it flung off a protective glove.</i>

33:08.016 --> 33:12.009
<i>Next,</i> Viking <i>prepared</i>
<i>to sniff the air...</i>

33:12.287 --> 33:14.312
<i>... and taste the soil.</i>

33:15.390 --> 33:16.516
<i>Finally...</i>

33:16.724 --> 33:20.285
<i>... it opened its eyes for a look</i>
<i>at its new surroundings.</i>

33:20.528 --> 33:22.826
(WHIRRING)

33:27.302 --> 33:31.898
<i>Viking's</i> first picture assignment
was to photograph its own foot.

33:32.273 --> 33:35.003
<i>In case it were to sink</i>
<i>into Martian quicksand...</i>

33:35.209 --> 33:37.871
<i>... we wanted to know about it</i>
<i>before it disappeared.</i>

33:38.112 --> 33:42.276
<i>Back on Earth, we waited</i>
<i>breathlessly for the first images.</i>

33:42.483 --> 33:46.783
Viking <i>painted its picture</i>
<i>in vertical strokes, line by line...</i>

33:46.988 --> 33:49.786
<i>... until, with enormous relief,</i>
<i>we saw the footpad...</i>

33:49.991 --> 33:52.653
<i>... securely planted</i>
<i>in the Martian soil.</i>

33:52.860 --> 33:57.797
<i>This was the first image</i>
<i>ever returned from the surface of Mars.</i>

34:03.504 --> 34:05.995
<i>The cameras on each</i>
Viking <i>lander revealed...</i>

34:06.207 --> 34:08.675
<i>... a kind of rocky desert.</i>

34:08.876 --> 34:10.673
<i>Beyond the lander itself...</i>

34:10.878 --> 34:12.709
<i>... we saw for the first time...</i>

34:12.914 --> 34:15.314
<i>... the landscape of the Red Planet.</i>

34:15.516 --> 34:19.179
<i>It didn't look like an alien world.</i>

34:19.520 --> 34:22.250
<i>There were rocks and sand dunes...</i>

34:22.457 --> 34:26.757
<i>... and gently rolling hills</i>
<i>as natural and familiar...</i>

34:26.961 --> 34:28.826
<i>... as any landscape on Earth.</i>

34:29.330 --> 34:33.391
<i>Forever after, Mars would be a place.</i>

34:39.207 --> 34:43.268
<i>We found that the Martian air</i>
<i>was less than 1% as dense as ours...</i>

34:43.478 --> 34:46.208
<i>... and made mostly of carbon dioxide.</i>

34:46.414 --> 34:49.178
<i>There were smaller amounts</i>
<i>of nitrogen, argon...</i>

34:49.384 --> 34:51.545
<i>... water vapor and oxygen.</i>

34:51.919 --> 34:54.854
<i>There was almost no ozone.</i>
<i>So the surface wasn't protected...</i>

34:55.056 --> 34:58.321
<i>... from the sun's ultraviolet light</i>
<i>as it is on Earth.</i>

34:59.127 --> 35:02.290
<i>On the warmest days,</i>
<i>it was distinctly chilly...</i>

35:02.497 --> 35:06.934
<i>... and every night the temperatures</i>
<i>plunged to 100 below.</i>

35:07.135 --> 35:12.072
<i>In winter, the surface was dusted</i>
<i>with a thin layer of frost.</i>

35:15.910 --> 35:20.142
<i>The landing sites were chosen</i>
<i>because they were safe and flat.</i>

35:20.548 --> 35:23.779
<i>Even so,</i> Viking <i>revolutionized</i>
<i>our knowledge...</i>

35:23.985 --> 35:25.953
<i>... of this rusty world.</i>

35:27.555 --> 35:30.183
<i>I would, of course, have been</i>
<i>surprised to see...</i>

35:30.391 --> 35:33.758
<i>... a grizzled prospector emerge</i>
<i>from behind a dune...</i>

35:33.961 --> 35:35.326
<i>... leading his mule.</i>

35:35.530 --> 35:39.864
<i>Yet the idea seemed</i>
<i>strangely appropriate.</i>

35:40.601 --> 35:42.535
<i>But at least while we were watching...</i>

35:42.737 --> 35:45.900
<i>... no prospector wandered by.</i>

35:50.711 --> 35:54.875
<i>We studied with exceptional care</i>
<i>each picture the cameras radioed back.</i>

35:55.082 --> 35:58.813
<i>But there was no hint</i>
<i>of the canals of Barsoom...</i>

35:59.020 --> 36:01.215
<i>... no sultry princesses...</i>

36:01.456 --> 36:05.449
<i>... no 10-foot-tall</i>
<i>green fighting men...</i>

36:06.227 --> 36:08.457
<i>... no thoats, no footprints...</i>

36:08.663 --> 36:11.632
<i>... not even a cactus</i>
<i>or a kangaroo rat.</i>

36:12.066 --> 36:15.558
<i>Perhaps there was life</i>
<i>inside the rocks...</i>

36:15.770 --> 36:17.328
<i>... or under the ground.</i>

36:17.805 --> 36:21.297
<i>If so, it had left no traces.</i>

36:27.882 --> 36:31.045
<i>For most of its history,</i>
<i>the Earth had microbes...</i>

36:31.252 --> 36:33.777
<i>... but no living things</i>
<i>big enough to see.</i>

36:34.455 --> 36:38.016
<i>Perhaps the same is true for Mars.</i>

36:55.142 --> 37:00.079
The <i>Viking</i> lander is a superbly
instrumented and designed machine.

37:00.815 --> 37:05.377
It extends human capabilities
to other and alien landscapes.

37:05.586 --> 37:09.818
By some standards, it's about
as smart as a grasshopper.

37:10.024 --> 37:13.187
By others, only as intelligent
as a bacterium.

37:13.394 --> 37:15.862
There's nothing demeaning
in these comparisons.

37:16.063 --> 37:20.329
It took nature hundreds of millions
of years to evolve a bacterium...

37:20.535 --> 37:22.833
...and billions of years
to make a grasshopper.

37:23.037 --> 37:25.528
With only a little experience
in this business...

37:25.740 --> 37:27.799
...we're getting pretty good at it.

37:29.810 --> 37:31.277
<i>In both landing sites...</i>

37:31.846 --> 37:34.679
<i>... in Chryse and Utopia...</i>

37:34.882 --> 37:38.147
<i>... we've begun to dig</i>
<i>in the sands of Mars.</i>

37:38.519 --> 37:40.953
<i>On a very small scale,</i>
<i>such trenches...</i>

37:41.155 --> 37:44.716
<i>... are the first human engineering</i>
<i>works on another world.</i>

37:55.937 --> 37:59.395
<i>The robot arm</i>
<i>retrieves soil samples...</i>

37:59.607 --> 38:03.134
<i>... and deposits them</i>
<i>into several sifters.</i>

38:04.478 --> 38:07.845
<i>Then the soil is carried</i>
<i>to five experiments:</i>

38:08.049 --> 38:09.880
<i>Two on the chemistry of the soil...</i>

38:10.084 --> 38:13.110
<i>... and three to look</i>
<i>for microbial life.</i>

38:14.422 --> 38:18.085
The <i>Viking</i> biology experiments
represent a pioneering first effort...

38:18.292 --> 38:20.590
...in the search for life
on another world.

38:20.795 --> 38:24.026
The results are
tantalizing, annoying...

38:24.231 --> 38:26.222
...provocative, stimulating...

38:26.434 --> 38:28.629
...and deeply ambiguous.

38:29.437 --> 38:32.201
By criteria established
before a launch...

38:32.406 --> 38:35.864
...two of the three <i>Viking</i>
microbiology experiments...

38:36.077 --> 38:39.046
...seem to have yielded
positive results.

38:39.246 --> 38:43.615
First, when Martian soil samples
are mixed together...

38:43.818 --> 38:46.048
...with an organic soup from Earth...

38:46.253 --> 38:50.053
...something in the soil
seems to have broken food down...

38:50.257 --> 38:53.420
...almost as if there were
little Martian microbes...

38:53.628 --> 38:56.688
...which metabolized, enjoyed...

38:56.897 --> 38:58.888
...the soup from Earth.

38:59.567 --> 39:02.468
Second, when gases from Earth...

39:02.670 --> 39:04.763
...were mixed together
with Martian soil...

39:05.573 --> 39:09.771
<i>... something seems to have chemically</i>
<i>combined the gases with soil...</i>

39:09.977 --> 39:12.878
<i>... almost as if there were little</i>
<i>Martian microbes capable...</i>

39:13.080 --> 39:17.676
<i>... of synthesizing organic matter</i>
<i>from atmospheric gases.</i>

39:17.885 --> 39:19.682
<i>But the situation is complex.</i>

39:19.887 --> 39:21.445
<i>Mars is not the Earth.</i>

39:21.656 --> 39:26.559
As the legacy of Percival Lowell
reminds us, we're liable to be fooled.

39:27.495 --> 39:30.430
Perhaps the ultraviolet light
from the sun...

39:30.631 --> 39:32.656
...strikes the Martian surface...

39:32.867 --> 39:37.270
...and makes some chemical
which can oxidize foodstuffs.

39:38.239 --> 39:40.833
Perhaps there is some catalyst
in the soil...

39:41.042 --> 39:44.842
...which can combine atmospheric gases
with the soil...

39:45.046 --> 39:47.378
...and make organic molecules.

39:48.015 --> 39:50.483
<i>The red sands of Mars</i>
<i>were excavated...</i>

39:50.685 --> 39:53.483
<i>... seven times at</i>
<i>the two different landing sites...</i>

39:53.688 --> 39:58.387
<i>... as distant from each other</i>
<i>as Boston is from Baghdad.</i>

39:59.126 --> 40:02.425
<i>Whatever was giving these results</i>
<i>was probably all over Mars...</i>

40:02.630 --> 40:06.498
<i>... but was it life, or just</i>
<i>the chemistry of the soil?</i>

40:06.867 --> 40:10.564
<i>Studies suggest that a kind of clay</i>
<i>known to exist on Mars...</i>

40:10.771 --> 40:14.901
<i>... can serve as a catalyst to</i>
<i>accelerate in the absence of life...</i>

40:15.109 --> 40:19.136
<i>... chemical reactions which</i>
<i>resemble the activities of life.</i>

40:21.282 --> 40:24.342
It may be that in the early history
of the Earth, before life...

40:24.552 --> 40:28.750
...there were little cycles,
chemical cycles running in the soil...

40:28.956 --> 40:32.050
...something like photosynthesis
and respiration...

40:32.259 --> 40:36.787
...which were then incorporated
by biology once life arose.

40:38.032 --> 40:42.731
<i>There may be life elsewhere than</i>
<i>in the two small sites we examined.</i>

40:42.937 --> 40:47.374
<i>Or perhaps there's life</i>
<i>of a different sort all over Mars.</i>

40:47.575 --> 40:51.204
<i>Life is just a kind of chemistry</i>
<i>of sufficient complexity...</i>

40:51.412 --> 40:54.176
<i>... to permit reproduction</i>
<i>and evolution.</i>

40:54.381 --> 40:57.248
<i>I wonder if we'll ever find</i>
<i>a specimen of life based...</i>

40:57.451 --> 40:59.316
<i>... not on organic molecules...</i>

40:59.520 --> 41:03.320
<i>... but on something else,</i>
<i>something more exotic.</i>

41:06.393 --> 41:10.056
The <i>Viking</i> experiments found
that the Martian soil is not...

41:10.264 --> 41:12.824
...loaded with organic remains...

41:13.033 --> 41:15.524
...of once living creatures.

41:15.736 --> 41:20.537
Maybe the surface's reactive chemistry
has destroyed organic molecules...

41:20.741 --> 41:22.504
...molecules based on carbon.

41:22.710 --> 41:24.610
Or maybe there's no life on Mars...

41:24.812 --> 41:28.179
...and all <i>Viking</i> found
was a funny soil chemistry.

41:28.382 --> 41:30.475
Or maybe there's life, okay...

41:30.684 --> 41:34.347
...but it's not based on organic
chemistry as much as life is on Earth.

41:35.589 --> 41:39.491
Personally, I don't think that's
a very likely possibility.

41:39.693 --> 41:43.026
I'm a carbon chauvinist.
I freely admit it.

41:43.230 --> 41:45.790
Carbon is tremendously abundant
in the cosmos...

41:46.000 --> 41:49.231
...and it makes marvelously complex
organic molecules...

41:49.436 --> 41:51.631
...that are terrifically
good for life.

41:51.839 --> 41:54.205
I'm also a water chauvinist.

41:54.408 --> 41:57.468
It's an ideal solvent
for organic molecules...

41:57.678 --> 42:01.444
...and it stays liquid over
a very wide range of temperatures.

42:01.649 --> 42:05.949
But sometimes I wonder,
could my fondness...

42:06.153 --> 42:09.122
...for these materials have
anything to do with the fact...

42:09.323 --> 42:11.553
...that I'm chiefly made up of them?

42:11.759 --> 42:16.287
Are we carbon and water-based because
these materials were abundant...

42:16.497 --> 42:18.965
...on the Earth at the time
of the origin of life?

42:19.166 --> 42:22.829
Might life elsewhere be based
on different stuff?

42:23.237 --> 42:25.000
(LIQUID GURGLES)

42:25.906 --> 42:30.104
I'm a collection of organic molecules
called Carl Sagan.

42:30.311 --> 42:33.405
You're a collection of almost
identical molecules...

42:33.614 --> 42:38.051
...with a different collective label.
But is that all?

42:38.252 --> 42:42.848
Is there nothing in here
but molecules?

42:43.090 --> 42:48.027
Some people find that idea
somehow demeaning to human dignity.

42:48.362 --> 42:52.594
But for myself, I find it
elevating and exhilarating...

42:52.800 --> 42:55.234
...to discover that we
live in a universe...

42:55.436 --> 42:59.167
...which permits the evolution
of molecular machines...

42:59.373 --> 43:02.968
...as intricate and subtle as we.

43:03.911 --> 43:08.473
The essence of life is not the atoms
and small molecules that go into us...

43:08.682 --> 43:11.549
...as the way, the ordering...

43:11.752 --> 43:14.380
...the way those molecules
are put together.

43:14.588 --> 43:17.079
Now, we sometimes read...

43:17.291 --> 43:20.351
...that the chemicals which make up
a human body are worth...

43:20.561 --> 43:24.497
...on the open market, only 97 cents
or $10, or some number like that.

43:24.832 --> 43:28.666
And it's depressing to find
our bodies valued at so little.

43:28.869 --> 43:31.531
But these estimates are for humans...

43:31.739 --> 43:35.266
...reduced to our simplest
possible components.

43:38.345 --> 43:41.473
What is all this stuff in front of me?

43:41.682 --> 43:46.210
These are exactly the atoms
that make up the human body...

43:46.420 --> 43:48.547
...and in the right proportions too.

43:48.756 --> 43:53.420
We're made mostly of water,
and that costs almost nothing.

43:53.627 --> 43:56.391
The carbon is counted as coal.

43:56.597 --> 43:59.327
The calcium in our bones is chalk.

43:59.533 --> 44:03.594
The nitrogen in our proteins
is liquid air.

44:03.804 --> 44:06.967
The iron in our blood
is rusty nails.

44:07.174 --> 44:09.699
Some phosphorus
and some trace elements.

44:10.144 --> 44:11.805
If we didn't know better...

44:12.012 --> 44:16.073
...we might be tempted
to take all these items...

44:16.283 --> 44:20.185
...and mix them together
in a container like this.

44:42.376 --> 44:43.809
And stir.

44:44.178 --> 44:45.975
We could stir all we want...

44:46.180 --> 44:49.741
...and at the end, all we'd have
is some boring mixture of atoms.

44:49.950 --> 44:51.713
How could we expect anything else?

44:52.219 --> 44:55.746
The beauty of a living thing
is not the atoms that go into it...

44:55.956 --> 44:57.924
...but the way those atoms
are put together:

44:58.125 --> 45:02.926
Information distilled over 4 billion
years of biological evolution.

45:03.130 --> 45:06.099
Incidentally, all the organisms
on the Earth are made...

45:06.300 --> 45:08.427
...essentially of that stuff.

45:08.635 --> 45:11.160
An eyedropper full of that liquid...

45:11.372 --> 45:15.775
...could be used to make
a caterpillar or a petunia...

45:15.976 --> 45:19.207
...if only we knew how to put
the components together.

45:20.547 --> 45:25.484
<i>All life on Earth is made from</i>
<i>the same mixture of the same atoms.</i>

45:26.020 --> 45:28.181
<i>On another planet, the jars of life...</i>

45:28.389 --> 45:32.291
<i>... might be filled with very</i>
<i>different atoms and small molecules.</i>

45:32.493 --> 45:36.429
<i>But I think the life forms on many</i>
<i>worlds will consist, by and large...</i>

45:36.630 --> 45:38.825
<i>... of the same atoms</i>
<i>that are popular here...</i>

45:39.033 --> 45:41.228
<i>... maybe even the same big molecules.</i>

45:41.435 --> 45:45.132
<i>So I don't believe we can rescue</i>
<i>the idea of life on Mars...</i>

45:45.339 --> 45:48.900
<i>... by appealing to some</i>
<i>exotic chemistry.</i>

45:50.544 --> 45:53.536
<i>Sometimes we hear about</i>
<i>possible life forms...</i>

45:53.747 --> 45:55.874
<i>... in which silicon replaces carbon...</i>

45:56.083 --> 45:58.847
<i>... or perhaps, liquid ammonia</i>
<i>replaces liquid water.</i>

45:59.053 --> 46:01.453
<i>But at Martian temperatures,</i>
<i>there are no...</i>

46:01.655 --> 46:05.955
<i>... plausible silicon-based molecules</i>
<i>which might carry a genetic code.</i>

46:06.160 --> 46:09.323
<i>And ammonia is liquid</i>
<i>only under higher pressures...</i>

46:09.530 --> 46:11.293
<i>... and lower temperatures.</i>

46:13.600 --> 46:17.661
<i>Someday in the distant future</i>
<i>we might have a collection of jars...</i>

46:17.871 --> 46:22.001
<i>... each containing the elementary</i>
<i>biochemistry of another world.</i>

46:22.242 --> 46:25.575
<i>I don't know if there'll be</i>
<i>one labeled "Mars."</i>

46:25.779 --> 46:27.076
<i>But if there is...</i>

46:27.281 --> 46:31.308
<i>... I bet it will be</i>
<i>full of organic molecules.</i>

46:35.122 --> 46:37.750
There's another way to search
for life on Mars...

46:37.958 --> 46:40.392
...to seek out the discoveries
and delights...

46:40.594 --> 46:43.392
...which that heterogeneous
environment promises us.

46:43.597 --> 46:47.294
One of the things that a grasshopper
can do but <i>Viking</i> can't...

46:47.501 --> 46:48.798
...is move.

46:49.002 --> 46:51.402
We landed in the dull places on Mars.

46:51.605 --> 46:56.542
For all the solid, scientific findings
and hints which <i>Viking</i> provided...

46:56.743 --> 47:01.544
...we know that there are many places
on the planet far more interesting.

47:01.748 --> 47:04.410
What we need is a roving vehicle...

47:04.618 --> 47:07.815
...with advanced experiments in
biology and organic chemistry...

47:08.021 --> 47:10.683
...able to land in the safe
but dull places...

47:10.891 --> 47:13.155
...and wander
to the interesting places.

47:23.504 --> 47:25.028
<i>This roving vehicle...</i>

47:25.239 --> 47:29.141
<i>... was developed by the</i>
<i>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</i>

47:29.343 --> 47:32.801
<i>It has a long list of dumb things</i>
<i>it knows not to do.</i>

47:33.013 --> 47:37.609
<i>A Mars rover hasn't got time to ask</i>
<i>if it should attempt a steep slope.</i>

47:37.818 --> 47:40.048
<i>Radio waves traveling</i>
<i>at the speed of light...</i>

47:40.254 --> 47:42.484
<i>... take 20 minutes</i>
<i>for the roundtrip to Earth.</i>

47:42.689 --> 47:45.624
<i>By the time it got an answer,</i>
<i>it might be...</i>

47:45.826 --> 47:48.556
<i>... a heap of twisted metal</i>
<i>at the bottom of a canyon.</i>

47:48.762 --> 47:51.697
<i>A rover has to think for itself.</i>

47:57.137 --> 48:00.436
<i>Imagine a rover with laser eyes</i>
<i>like this one...</i>

48:00.641 --> 48:04.077
<i>... but packed with sophisticated</i>
<i>biological and chemical instruments...</i>

48:04.278 --> 48:07.714
<i>... sampler arms, microscopes</i>
<i>and television cameras...</i>

48:07.915 --> 48:11.180
<i>... wandering over</i>
<i>the Martian landscape.</i>

48:12.719 --> 48:15.711
<i>It could drive to its own</i>
<i>horizon every day.</i>

48:15.923 --> 48:19.188
<i>A distant feature it barely</i>
<i>resolves at sunrise...</i>

48:19.393 --> 48:23.796
<i>... it can be sniffing and tasting</i>
<i>by nightfall.</i>

48:28.969 --> 48:32.461
<i>Billions of people could watch</i>
<i>the unfolding adventure...</i>

48:32.673 --> 48:37.167
<i>... on their TV sets as the rover</i>
<i>explores the ancient river bottoms...</i>

48:37.377 --> 48:38.935
<i>... or cautiously approaches...</i>

48:39.146 --> 48:42.513
<i>... the enigmatic pyramids of Elysium.</i>

48:42.916 --> 48:46.215
<i>A new age of discovery</i>
<i>would have begun.</i>

48:49.356 --> 48:51.881
<i>Most of the human species</i>
<i>would witness...</i>

48:52.092 --> 48:55.289
<i>... the exploration of another world.</i>

49:00.567 --> 49:03.468
Only 80 years ago, we could come
no closer to Mars...

49:03.670 --> 49:07.003
...than straining to see
a tiny, shimmering image...

49:07.207 --> 49:09.767
...through a telescope in Arizona.

49:09.977 --> 49:13.879
Now our instruments have actually
touched down on the planet.

49:14.581 --> 49:19.348
<i>Viking</i> is a legacy of H.G. Wells...

49:19.553 --> 49:21.953
...Percival Lowell, Robert Goddard.

49:22.155 --> 49:26.353
Science is a collaborative enterprise
spanning the generations.

49:26.560 --> 49:31.293
When it permits us to see the far side
of some new horizon...

49:31.498 --> 49:33.591
...we remember those
who prepared the way...

49:33.800 --> 49:36.428
...seeing for them also.

49:38.939 --> 49:43.569
<i>On each lander, there is a microdot</i>
<i>on which is written very small...</i>

49:43.777 --> 49:46.007
<i>... the names of 10,000</i>
<i>men and women...</i>

49:46.213 --> 49:49.011
<i>... responsible for</i> Viking's
<i>splendid achievement.</i>

49:49.216 --> 49:52.708
<i>One of the names on this microdot</i>
<i>belonged to a friend of mine:</i>

49:52.919 --> 49:56.787
<i>A remarkable microbiologist</i>
<i>named Wolf Vishniac.</i>

49:56.990 --> 49:59.481
<i>He was the first person</i>
<i>to build a machine...</i>

49:59.693 --> 50:02.127
<i>... to look for microbes</i>
<i>on another world.</i>

50:03.063 --> 50:05.827
His friends called it the "Wolf Trap."

50:06.033 --> 50:08.433
It contained a liquid nutrient...

50:08.635 --> 50:11.604
...to which Martian soil
would be added...

50:11.805 --> 50:13.830
...and any microbes
that liked the food...

50:14.041 --> 50:17.636
...would grow in that nutrient
medium and cloud it.

50:17.844 --> 50:20.642
The Wolf Trap was selected
to go with <i>Viking</i> to Mars...

50:20.847 --> 50:25.079
...but NASA is especially vulnerable
to budget cuts...

50:25.285 --> 50:27.879
...and it was removed
as an economy measure.

50:28.088 --> 50:32.616
It was a terrible blow to Vishniac.
He'd worked 12 years on it.

50:32.826 --> 50:36.387
Others might have
stalked off the project...

50:36.596 --> 50:39.588
...but Vishniac was a gentle
and dedicated man.

50:39.800 --> 50:44.635
He decided instead to study the most
Mars-like environment on this planet:

50:44.838 --> 50:49.537
<i>The dry valleys of Antarctica,</i>
<i>which were long thought to be lifeless.</i>

50:53.914 --> 50:57.441
<i>But Vishniac believed that if he</i>
<i>could find microbes growing...</i>

50:57.651 --> 51:00.950
<i>... in these arid polar wastes...</i>

51:01.154 --> 51:04.715
<i>... the chances of life on Mars</i>
<i>would improve.</i>

51:07.961 --> 51:10.429
<i>So in November 1973...</i>

51:10.630 --> 51:12.860
<i>... Vishniac was left</i>
<i>in a remote valley...</i>

51:13.066 --> 51:16.365
<i>... in the Asgard Mountains</i>
<i>of Antarctica.</i>

51:17.137 --> 51:20.265
<i>He set up hundreds of little</i>
<i>sample collectors...</i>

51:20.874 --> 51:24.970
<i>... simple versions of the</i> Viking
<i>microbiology experiments.</i>

51:25.746 --> 51:26.770
<i>On December 10th...</i>

51:26.980 --> 51:29.676
<i>... he left camp</i>
<i>to retrieve some samples...</i>

51:29.883 --> 51:31.612
<i>... and never returned.</i>

51:32.219 --> 51:34.551
<i>He had wandered</i>
<i>to an unexplored area...</i>

51:34.755 --> 51:36.518
<i>... apparently slipped on the ice...</i>

51:36.723 --> 51:39.521
<i>... and fell more than 100 meters.</i>

51:40.293 --> 51:42.955
Maybe something had caught his eye...

51:43.163 --> 51:45.893
...a likely habitat for microbes...

51:46.099 --> 51:48.966
...or a patch of green
where none should be.

51:49.169 --> 51:51.433
The last entry in his notebook was:

51:51.638 --> 51:56.575
"Station 202 retrieved.
2230 hours.

51:56.877 --> 51:59.812
Soil temperature, minus 10 degrees.

52:00.013 --> 52:03.676
Air temperature, minus 16 degrees."

52:03.884 --> 52:07.650
It had been a typical
summer temperature...

52:07.888 --> 52:09.287
...for Mars.

52:09.890 --> 52:12.484
Some of his soil samples
were later returned...

52:12.692 --> 52:14.523
...and his colleagues discovered...

52:14.728 --> 52:17.822
...that there is life
in the dry valleys of Antarctica...

52:18.031 --> 52:21.125
...that life is even more tenacious
than we had imagined.

52:21.334 --> 52:26.169
That fact may turn out to be important
for the future history of Mars.

52:31.244 --> 52:33.075
There will be a time...

52:33.280 --> 52:35.748
...when Mars is thoroughly explored.

52:35.949 --> 52:39.077
What then?
What should we do with Mars?

52:40.020 --> 52:44.047
If there is life on Mars, then I
believe we should do nothing...

52:44.257 --> 52:46.088
...to disturb that life.

52:47.027 --> 52:51.964
Mars, then, belongs to the Martians,
even if they are microbes.

52:52.199 --> 52:54.759
But suppose that Mars is
in fact lifeless.

52:54.968 --> 52:58.529
Might we in some sense be able
to live there...

52:58.738 --> 53:01.969
...to somehow make Mars
habitable like the Earth...

53:02.175 --> 53:05.269
...to terraform another world?

53:07.781 --> 53:10.682
As lovely a world as Mars is...

53:10.884 --> 53:12.647
...it poses certain problems.

53:12.853 --> 53:15.378
There's too little oxygen,
no liquid water...

53:15.589 --> 53:17.557
...and too much ultraviolet light.

53:17.757 --> 53:22.091
But all that could be solved
if we could make more air.

53:22.295 --> 53:26.391
With higher atmospheric pressures,
liquid water would become possible.

53:26.600 --> 53:29.569
With more oxygen we could
breathe the atmosphere.

53:29.769 --> 53:32.670
And ozone could form
to shield the surface...

53:32.873 --> 53:35.273
...from the solar ultraviolet light.

53:35.475 --> 53:38.035
The evidence for liquid water
suggests...

53:38.245 --> 53:40.839
...that Mars once had
a denser atmosphere...

53:41.047 --> 53:43.277
...which can't have all
escaped to space.

53:43.483 --> 53:45.849
It has to be on the planet somewhere.

53:46.319 --> 53:48.378
In subsurface ice, surely...

53:48.588 --> 53:52.786
...but most accessibly
in the present polar caps.

53:54.928 --> 53:58.489
To vaporize the icecaps,
we must heat them...

53:58.698 --> 54:03.635
...preferably by covering them with
something dark to absorb more sunlight.

54:03.870 --> 54:07.362
That thing ought to also be cheap
and able to make copies of itself.

54:07.574 --> 54:12.238
Well, there are such things.
We call them plants.

54:13.013 --> 54:17.382
<i>We would need to evolve by artificial</i>
<i>selection and genetic engineering...</i>

54:17.584 --> 54:22.248
...dark plants able to survive
the severe Martian environment.

54:22.956 --> 54:24.787
Such plants could be seeded...

54:24.991 --> 54:28.017
...on the vast expanse
of the Martian polar icecaps...

54:28.328 --> 54:31.388
...taking root, spreading,
giving off oxygen...

54:31.598 --> 54:34.089
...darkening the surface,
melting the ice...

54:34.301 --> 54:37.634
...and releasing
the ancient Martian atmosphere...

54:37.837 --> 54:40.101
...from its long captivity.

54:42.542 --> 54:46.444
We might even imagine a kind of
Martian Johnny Appleseed...

54:46.646 --> 54:48.273
...robot or human...

54:48.481 --> 54:52.713
...roaming the frozen polar wastes
in an endeavor which benefits...

54:52.919 --> 54:55.012
...only the generations to come.

54:55.221 --> 54:59.021
It might take hundreds
or thousands of years.

55:04.364 --> 55:06.958
We might, then, want to carry
the liberated water...

55:07.167 --> 55:09.158
...from the melting polar icecaps...

55:09.369 --> 55:11.769
...to the warmer equatorial regions.

55:11.972 --> 55:13.940
And there's a way to do it:

55:14.140 --> 55:17.007
We would build canals.

55:17.477 --> 55:20.173
But that's exactly what
Percival Lowell believed...

55:20.380 --> 55:22.507
...was happening on Mars in his time.

55:22.716 --> 55:26.174
The idea of a canal network
built by Martians...

55:26.386 --> 55:29.787
...may turn out to be
a kind of premonition...

55:29.990 --> 55:32.720
...because, if the planet
ever is terraformed...

55:32.926 --> 55:34.894
...it will be done by human beings...

55:35.095 --> 55:38.792
...whose permanent residence
and planetary affiliation...

55:38.999 --> 55:40.296
...is Mars.

55:40.500 --> 55:43.799
The Martians will be us.

56:16.236 --> 56:20.366
Mars today is strictly relevant to
the global environment of the Earth.

56:20.573 --> 56:24.270
Its antiseptic surface is
a cautionary tale of what happens...

56:24.477 --> 56:26.308
...if you don't have an ozone layer.

56:26.513 --> 56:30.381
Its great dust storms and the resulting
cooling of its surface...

56:30.583 --> 56:33.017
...played a role in the discovery
of nuclear winter...

56:33.219 --> 56:37.315
...the catastrophic climate change on
Earth predicted to follow nuclear war.

56:37.524 --> 56:41.426
So if you didn't have an ounce
of adventuresome spirit in you...

56:41.628 --> 56:45.325
...it would still make sense
to support the exploration of Mars.

56:46.166 --> 56:48.930
In recent years, there's been...

56:49.135 --> 56:51.035
...a groundswell of interest...

56:51.237 --> 56:55.674
...in organizing the first expedition
of humans to go to the planet Mars.

56:55.875 --> 56:59.902
We first need more robotic missions,
including rovers...

57:00.113 --> 57:03.310
...balloons and return-
sample missions...

57:03.516 --> 57:06.417
...and more experience
in long duration space flight.

57:06.619 --> 57:08.484
<i>But eventually, if all goes well...</i>

57:08.688 --> 57:11.020
<i>... the interplanetary</i>
<i>ship or ships...</i>

57:11.224 --> 57:13.385
<i>... would be constructed</i>
<i>in Earth orbit...</i>

57:14.194 --> 57:16.924
<i>... launched on the long</i>
<i>journey to Mars...</i>

57:17.731 --> 57:20.962
<i>... and then a landing module</i>
<i>would set down on the surface.</i>

57:21.167 --> 57:22.566
<i>The crew would emerge...</i>

57:22.769 --> 57:26.762
<i>... making the first human footfalls</i>
<i>on another planet.</i>

57:28.074 --> 57:30.702
It would be very expensive,
of course...

57:30.910 --> 57:33.572
...although cheaper
if many nations share the cost.

57:33.780 --> 57:38.046
The key issue in my mind is whether
the unmet needs here on Earth...

57:38.251 --> 57:39.980
...should take priority.

57:40.286 --> 57:43.722
But that's a question even more
appropriately addressed...

57:43.923 --> 57:45.857
...to the military budgets...

57:46.059 --> 57:49.927
...now $1 trillion a year worldwide.

57:50.130 --> 57:52.121
You can buy a lot for that.

57:52.665 --> 57:56.499
Justifications for the Mars endeavor
have been offered in terms of...

57:56.703 --> 57:58.227
...scientific exploration...

57:58.438 --> 58:01.771
...developing technology,
international cooperation...

58:01.975 --> 58:04.443
...education, the environment.

58:04.644 --> 58:09.081
Some see it as the obvious response
to the future calling.

58:09.282 --> 58:12.615
<i>Some even think we should go</i>
<i>to investigate enigmatic landforms...</i>

58:12.819 --> 58:15.754
<i>... including one that resembles</i>
<i>an enormous human face.</i>

58:16.356 --> 58:19.484
<i>Personally, I think this,</i>
<i>like hundreds of other...</i>

58:19.692 --> 58:21.421
...blocky mesas there...

58:21.628 --> 58:23.926
...is sculpted by
the high-speed winds.

58:24.130 --> 58:26.963
But if we're going anyway,
there's no harm in taking a look.

58:27.167 --> 58:30.568
A remarkably diverse group
of American leaders...

58:30.770 --> 58:32.965
...has endorsed the Mars goal.

58:33.840 --> 58:36.809
<i>I imagine the emissaries from Earth...</i>

58:37.010 --> 58:39.308
<i>... citizens of many nations...</i>

58:39.512 --> 58:42.640
<i>... wandering down an ancient</i>
<i>river valley on Mars...</i>

58:42.849 --> 58:46.285
<i>... trying to understand</i>
<i>how a quite Earth-like world...</i>

58:46.486 --> 58:49.944
<i>... was converted</i>
<i>into a permanent ice age...</i>

58:50.156 --> 58:54.320
<i>... and looking for signs of</i>
<i>ancient life along the river banks.</i>

58:55.028 --> 58:56.017
In the long run...

58:56.229 --> 58:59.096
...the significance of such a mission
is nothing less...

58:59.299 --> 59:03.633
...than the conversion of humanity
into a multi-planet species.
