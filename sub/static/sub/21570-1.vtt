02:32.542 --> 02:33.583
Where is Alison?

02:33.583 --> 02:35.375
You're gonna be late
for your date.

02:35.375 --> 02:36.208
Relax, Erin.

02:36.208 --> 02:37.208
The restaurant's right
around the corner.

02:37.208 --> 02:38.208
I have plenty of time.

02:38.208 --> 02:40.375
Leigh, you have to go home
and change first.

02:40.375 --> 02:41.625
Take the blue dress
from my closet.

02:41.625 --> 02:43.291
Oh, and my yellow sweater.

02:43.291 --> 02:44.417
What is wrong
with what I'm wearing?

02:44.417 --> 02:45.709
You're going on a date.

02:45.709 --> 02:47.083
Your first date
since you broke up with-

02:47.083 --> 02:47.875
Aaaaah!

02:47.875 --> 02:48.709
Don't say it.

02:48.709 --> 02:50.208
He who shall not be named.

02:50.208 --> 02:51.041
Thank you.

02:51.041 --> 02:53.291
I just think you should look
like you're at least trying.

02:53.291 --> 02:54.542
This is so exciting!

02:54.542 --> 02:55.583
Why aren't you more excited?

02:55.583 --> 02:58.917
Because it's my first date
since I broke up with...

02:58.917 --> 03:01.500
I'm just trying to keep
expectations low.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.709
Hi, ladies.

03:02.709 --> 03:03.875
Sorry I'm late,

03:03.875 --> 03:06.667
I was stuck on a call with
advertising just explaining

03:06.667 --> 03:09.792
that The Richards Record
is a serious, hard-hitting

03:09.792 --> 03:12.000
online news magazine
that deserves respect.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.041
But I am here now
and my full attention

03:14.041 --> 03:17.041
is on my top two editors so they
can pitch me new ideas

03:17.041 --> 03:18.709
for the next edition of...?

03:18.709 --> 03:20.333
The Bad Date Chronicles.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.667
The Foodie Country Blog.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.500
Hard-hitting news magazine

03:23.500 --> 03:25.834
with a softer, more human edge.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.250
What have you got?

03:38.166 --> 03:41.417
All I'm saying is that I think
you're overdressed.

03:41.417 --> 03:42.208
It's our first date.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.542
Exactly. You're setting the bar
way too high.

03:44.542 --> 03:45.083
Look, Brad.

03:45.083 --> 03:46.166
She knows I'm the Styles
and Trends editor

03:46.166 --> 03:46.917
for The Peters Post.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.291
I have to look good, ok?

03:48.291 --> 03:50.458
I can't show up wearing
ratty jeans and a t-shirt.

03:50.458 --> 03:51.875
Hey. I look good.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.250
Yeah, for the editor
of a sport's blog.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.500
Conner and Brad, my
two favourite editors.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.792
You say that to all your
editors, Milo?

03:56.792 --> 03:58.667
Yeah, but with you two
I actually mean it.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.208
Just don't tell that to Susan
at the news desk,

04:00.208 --> 04:01.417
it might break her heart.

04:01.417 --> 04:02.291
Hey, Milo.

04:02.291 --> 04:04.208
Don't you think that Conner
is a bit overdressed

04:04.208 --> 04:05.542
for a first date?

04:05.542 --> 04:06.625
No, he's a style guy.

04:06.625 --> 04:09.250
He has to look stylish,
otherwise he's the sports guy.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.417
Hey, I still think
you're gonna regret

04:10.417 --> 04:11.375
wearing those nice clothes.

04:11.375 --> 04:12.583
Think fast!

04:16.541 --> 04:17.750
Dude!

04:17.750 --> 04:19.208
I've got an extra pair of pants
in the car.

04:19.208 --> 04:20.500
I will be right back.

04:25.542 --> 04:26.417
And if you don't like those,

04:26.417 --> 04:27.834
I also have two
really good submissions

04:27.834 --> 04:29.750
for this week's
Bad Date Chronicles.

04:29.750 --> 04:32.041
One is from Becky who's date
brought his mother.

04:32.041 --> 04:34.083
The second is Steve who forgot
to put his car in park

04:34.083 --> 04:35.417
and it rolled into the lake.

04:35.417 --> 04:36.250
Car in the lake.

04:36.250 --> 04:37.208
That'll make better headlines.

04:37.208 --> 04:38.458
That is so depressing.

04:38.458 --> 04:39.583
Do you know what we need?

04:39.583 --> 04:42.458
A true love blog to balance
out your Bad Date Chronicles.

04:42.458 --> 04:43.333
True love?

04:43.333 --> 04:45.500
We don't do fiction
at The Richards Record.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.125
Besides, nobody wants to read
about happy people.

04:48.125 --> 04:50.000
Happy people
don't get page views.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.417
She's right, Erin.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.458
Not many people are into hearts
and flowers anymore.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.375
Says the girl going
on a date tonight.

04:55.375 --> 04:56.625
A date?

04:56.625 --> 04:59.208
Well, I should really let you
get going so you can go change.

04:59.208 --> 05:00.166
See?

05:00.166 --> 05:01.959
She's got a date with
the Style and Trends editor-

05:01.959 --> 05:02.625
Erin?

05:02.625 --> 05:04.333
Over at The Peters Post.

05:04.333 --> 05:05.750
Peters Post?!

05:08.834 --> 05:11.375
Do not get me started
about Milo Peters!

05:21.250 --> 05:22.208
Huh?

05:22.208 --> 05:22.917
No.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.375
No, I'm not going
on a date like this.

05:24.375 --> 05:25.291
Why not?

05:25.291 --> 05:27.166
Because I look like a roadie
for a hair metal band.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.291
Well, maybe she likes music.

05:29.291 --> 05:31.083
Conner, why don't you just
go home and change?

05:31.083 --> 05:32.333
I can't. I'm already
running late,

05:32.333 --> 05:33.834
the restaurant's all
the way across town.

05:33.834 --> 05:34.834
How's my phone?

05:34.834 --> 05:36.291
Uh, it got coffee too.

05:36.291 --> 05:37.250
It's flickering on and off.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.041
Sorry, dude.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.250
Just use the one on the desk.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.417
I can't. Her name is
in my contacts.

05:40.417 --> 05:42.208
Why don't you just explain
it to her when you get there.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.041
You'll probably have a good
laugh over it.

05:44.041 --> 05:44.834
Hey, Brad.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.291
She edits a blog called
The Bad Date Chronicles, ok?

05:47.291 --> 05:48.792
So if I show up
looking like this,

05:48.792 --> 05:50.083
I end up on the front page.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.250
The Bad Date Chronicles?

05:52.250 --> 05:52.917
Yeah.

05:52.917 --> 05:56.208
Do not get my started
about Alison Richards!

05:56.208 --> 05:58.291
You know who Milo Peters
stole his entire idea from,

05:58.291 --> 05:59.083
don't you?

05:59.083 --> 05:59.667
You?

05:59.667 --> 06:00.583
Me.

06:00.583 --> 06:01.667
I hired him.

06:01.667 --> 06:02.583
I trained him.

06:02.583 --> 06:04.041
I was his mentor.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.333
He turned around,
stabs me in the back,

06:05.333 --> 06:07.834
and starts the ridiculous
Peters Post.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.291
She still tells people
I stole her idea

06:10.291 --> 06:12.125
for The Peters Post.

06:12.125 --> 06:14.709
Like doing an online magazine
is some brilliant idea

06:14.709 --> 06:16.125
no one's ever thought of before.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.041
I am so late.

06:17.041 --> 06:18.792
Conner?

06:18.792 --> 06:21.333
Do not give this woman
any ammunition

06:21.333 --> 06:24.625
for The Bad Date Chronicles,
please.

06:24.625 --> 06:25.917
Any more ammunition.

06:25.917 --> 06:27.125
Yeah, thanks boss.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.125
I feel better already.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.875
Do not reveal any of
our company's secrets,

06:29.875 --> 06:31.875
but get him to reveal his.

06:31.875 --> 06:33.500
Is it too late to get out
of this date?

06:33.500 --> 06:35.333
Stop. It'll be fine.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.792
You won't end up in
The Bad Date Chronicles.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.208
What happened?

06:48.208 --> 06:50.375
You are never going
to believe this.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.542
First, he was late.

06:51.542 --> 06:52.834
Really late.

06:52.834 --> 06:53.750
 And he didn't
call you?

06:53.750 --> 06:54.375
 No.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.250
I was just getting ready
to leave when he rushes up.

06:56.250 --> 06:56.959
Hey.

06:56.959 --> 06:57.667
Hey, hey, hey.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.417
I'm sorry, look.

06:58.417 --> 06:59.125
My car wouldn't start

06:59.125 --> 07:00.166
so I had to get a cab
and race over here-

07:00.166 --> 07:01.917
 I thought he was
a style editor?

07:01.917 --> 07:04.208
 He said something about coffee and switching clothes

07:04.208 --> 07:06.083
with his friend, and
that he tried to call me

07:06.083 --> 07:07.625
but his phone didn't work.

07:07.625 --> 07:08.959
Then...

07:08.959 --> 07:10.250
Julian called.

07:10.250 --> 07:10.875
Ju- Julian?

07:10.875 --> 07:11.792
Peters Post?

07:11.792 --> 07:13.291
 He didn't make
a reservation?

07:13.291 --> 07:14.500
 Apparently not.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.959
We had to wait at the bar
for 45 minutes.

07:16.959 --> 07:18.500
I- I came here on a date,
I need you to help me.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.542
 Why didn't you go
some place else?

07:20.542 --> 07:22.709
Because he said it was the
hottest restaurant in town.

07:22.709 --> 07:23.375
Ugh.

07:23.375 --> 07:24.750
Typical trends editor.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.959
Once we got to the table,
things were ok.

07:26.959 --> 07:29.583
Because all great love stories
start with things going "ok".

07:29.583 --> 07:30.792
You know what I mean.

07:30.792 --> 07:32.458
I didn't feel any butterflies,

07:32.458 --> 07:33.834
but he was charming and smart

07:33.834 --> 07:35.875
and it was going fine
and then...

07:35.875 --> 07:37.291
MaÃ®tre d' hooked me up.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.500
I love it.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.333
Oh man, this is...
this is the best.

07:41.333 --> 07:42.333
You gotta try this.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.041
Oh, that's ok.

07:43.041 --> 07:43.667
I uh-

07:43.667 --> 07:44.458
Seriously, this will take-

07:46.667 --> 07:48.166
 He set you on fire?!

07:48.166 --> 07:50.375
Sorry.

07:50.375 --> 07:52.125
In his defense, he did
put me out quickly.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.166
No, no!

07:59.208 --> 08:00.250
Look at it this way.

08:00.250 --> 08:02.542
At least you can say
you felt a spark.

08:02.542 --> 08:04.208
Yeah, it's a little soon
for fire jokes.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.583
Sorry.

08:05.583 --> 08:08.000
Especially because I'm not
even finished the story yet.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.375
Don't tell me it gets worse.

08:09.375 --> 08:11.375
Mmmhmm.

08:11.375 --> 08:12.750
 He left?!

08:12.750 --> 08:14.250
Leigh) At first I thought
was in the bathroom.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.792
Or maybe making a call
on his broken phone

08:16.792 --> 08:18.750
but he never came back, so-

08:18.750 --> 08:19.834
 No!

08:19.834 --> 08:20.792
 Yes.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.417
I had to pay the whole bill.

08:23.417 --> 08:25.333
You are going to make him
reimburse you.

08:25.333 --> 08:26.458
Reimburse us?

08:26.458 --> 08:28.959
No. I just want to dry off,
accept the fact that

08:28.959 --> 08:30.792
I'm never going on a date again

08:30.792 --> 08:32.375
and eat my body weight
in ice cream.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.166
I will admit, this was
not a great re-entry

08:34.166 --> 08:35.166
into the dating pool.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.250
But, on the other hand,

08:37.250 --> 08:38.917
maybe this is an improvement
from your break-up with-

08:38.917 --> 08:40.082
Don't say his name!

08:40.082 --> 08:41.792
The worst human
who ever lived.

08:41.792 --> 08:42.792
Thank you.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.917
How awful is it that being
set on fire is actually better

08:44.917 --> 08:47.375
than my last serious
relationship?

08:47.375 --> 08:49.667
Well, at least now you have
your own bad date chronicle

08:49.667 --> 08:51.500
and you're not just editing
other people's.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.542
I am not putting this
on the site.

08:53.542 --> 08:54.583
Uh, yeah you are.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.959
You're gonna crush
every other bad date ever.

08:56.959 --> 08:58.208
It's not a competition, Erin.

08:58.208 --> 08:58.917
It should be.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.041
'Cause you'd win.

09:03.792 --> 09:04.792
Hey, buddy.

09:04.792 --> 09:05.834
How was the big date?

09:05.834 --> 09:06.750
It was a disaster.

09:06.750 --> 09:07.500
Why?

09:07.500 --> 09:08.959
Well, I couldn't get my car
to start

09:08.959 --> 09:11.083
so I had to take a cab
and race over there.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.375
 Julian,
the restaurant critic,

09:12.375 --> 09:15.125
said he would get me a
reservation at Il Tempo.

09:15.125 --> 09:16.208
 And he didn't?

09:16.208 --> 09:17.959
Julian!

09:17.959 --> 09:20.166
Onner) So we were at
bar for like half an hour.

09:20.166 --> 09:21.417
 Why didn't you just
go somewhere else?

09:21.417 --> 09:22.458
Because I didn't have my car

09:22.458 --> 09:25.083
and I wasn't gonna
ask her to drive, and besides,

09:25.083 --> 09:29.250
once we started talking
she was smart and funny.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.542
It wasn't bad.

09:30.542 --> 09:31.959
When you're telling your buddy
about the hot date

09:31.959 --> 09:33.041
you went on the night before,

09:33.041 --> 09:36.208
you probably shouldn't include
the phrase "it wasn't bad".

09:36.208 --> 09:39.417
Yeah, well, it definitely
got hotter.

09:39.417 --> 09:40.208
Oh man, this is-

09:40.208 --> 09:41.166
this is the best.

09:41.166 --> 09:41.959
You gotta try this.

09:41.959 --> 09:43.208
Oh, that's ok, I have-

09:43.208 --> 09:44.208
Seriously, this will change
your life-

09:47.750 --> 09:49.583
She set herself on fire?

09:49.583 --> 09:50.917
I'm totally freaking out!

09:52.041 --> 09:53.583
Onner) I'm convinced that
s woman's gonna press charges

09:53.583 --> 09:54.667
against me or something,

09:54.667 --> 09:56.375
so I go to get her
some paper towels,

09:56.375 --> 09:58.875
and to splash some water
on my face.

10:01.375 --> 10:02.417
You know, that waiter
would have

10:02.417 --> 10:03.375
probably brought you
another pitcher.

10:03.375 --> 10:04.500
Shut up.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.959
 Anyway, I managed
not to hyperventilate,

10:06.959 --> 10:07.750
and then...

10:14.792 --> 10:16.875
Hello?

10:16.875 --> 10:18.000
Hello!

10:18.000 --> 10:20.667
You got locked in the bathroom?

10:23.375 --> 10:24.917
By the time I got out
she was gone.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.750
And to make things worse,
she paid.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.583
Oh, dude. That's bad.

10:28.583 --> 10:29.542
I wanted to try to call her

10:29.542 --> 10:30.875
to explain everything
that happened

10:30.875 --> 10:32.500
but my phone still
wasn't working

10:32.500 --> 10:35.959
so I just crashed and figured
I'd deal with it in the morning.

10:35.959 --> 10:37.041
Conner.

10:37.041 --> 10:38.083
I've been trying to call you
for an hour.

10:38.083 --> 10:38.959
You gotta see this.

10:38.959 --> 10:39.792
What's going on?

10:39.792 --> 10:40.792
Everyone's looking for you.

10:40.792 --> 10:41.542
Why?

10:41.542 --> 10:42.625
Because of how your date
went last night.

10:42.625 --> 10:43.750
How do you know how my date
went last night?

10:43.750 --> 10:45.709
The whole world knows how
your date went last night.

10:45.709 --> 10:47.500
Read.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.041
"He showed up an hour late
looking like he had just come

10:49.041 --> 10:51.125
"from playing video games
in his mother's basement."

10:51.125 --> 10:52.125
Oh no.

10:52.125 --> 10:55.500
We got calls from websites,
TV stations, newspapers...

10:55.500 --> 10:57.291
You've gone viral, dude!

10:57.291 --> 10:58.500
She didn't even use my name.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.458
How-

10:59.458 --> 11:01.792
"My date with Conrad,
a lifestyle and trends editor

11:01.792 --> 11:03.208
"for an online magazine."

11:03.208 --> 11:04.834
It wasn't hard to crack
the code.

11:04.834 --> 11:05.959
Guys, what do I do?

11:05.959 --> 11:08.375
Change your name,
move to another state?

11:08.375 --> 11:09.500
I have to try to talk to her,
you know?

11:09.500 --> 11:10.583
Convince her to take it down.

11:10.583 --> 11:11.917
Post a retraction or something.

11:11.917 --> 11:12.875
Excellent idea.

11:12.875 --> 11:15.625
Yes, do that.

11:15.625 --> 11:16.750
Where are you going?

11:16.750 --> 11:17.750
With you.

11:17.750 --> 11:20.917
You were late for dinner
and she set herself on fire.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.667
I have to see what she's doing
for an encore.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.000
Leigh.

11:35.000 --> 11:35.750
Conner.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.041
Conner!

11:37.041 --> 11:38.667
You have a lot of nerve!

11:38.667 --> 11:40.083
He's got a lot of nerve?

11:40.083 --> 11:41.417
She's the one making up stuff
about their dates

11:41.417 --> 11:43.166
and broadcasting it
to the world.

11:43.166 --> 11:43.834
Who are you?

11:43.834 --> 11:45.500
His friend Brad,
who are you?

11:45.500 --> 11:47.041
I'm her friend, Erin.

11:47.041 --> 11:48.458
What does he mean,
I made stuff up?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.208
What you wrote on your site,
that didn't happen.

11:50.208 --> 11:50.875
I was there.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.667
I was the one on fire,
remember?

11:52.667 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, I feel terrible
about that,

11:54.000 --> 11:55.875
but there were extenuating
circumstances.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.625
Look, I didn't use your name.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.000
Yeah, but everyone knows
it's me.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.583
This could affect my job,
my life.

12:00.583 --> 12:02.333
My mother called me
all the way from Ohio

12:02.333 --> 12:04.834
asking what she had done wrong
to make me turn out like this.

12:04.834 --> 12:05.375
Really?

12:05.375 --> 12:06.792
Yeah.

12:06.792 --> 12:07.667
I'm sorry, I-

12:07.667 --> 12:08.417
Don't be sorry.

12:08.417 --> 12:09.834
This is his fault, Leigh.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.417
It is not his fault.

12:11.417 --> 12:12.834
You haven't even heard
his side of it yet.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.959
Well, he has a column
in The Peters Post.

12:14.959 --> 12:16.875
Maybe he should go see
if the truth is trending.

12:16.875 --> 12:17.542
Oh, no-

12:17.542 --> 12:18.625
Ok. He will.

12:18.625 --> 12:19.500
No, maybe we should-

12:19.500 --> 12:21.709
No, Conner, it is time
to fight fire with fire.

12:21.709 --> 12:22.583
See what I did there?

12:22.583 --> 12:23.834
Funny. Very funny.

12:23.834 --> 12:25.834
We'll just see who has
the last laugh.

12:32.417 --> 12:33.750
Put something in there about
all we should do

12:33.750 --> 12:35.208
is think about is think
about herself.

12:35.208 --> 12:37.417
"Oh, I can't believe
he made me wait.

12:37.417 --> 12:39.125
"Oh, I'm on fire!"

12:39.125 --> 12:40.000
I'm not gonna say that.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.125
"And he didn't call to explain
what had happened.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.750
"Maybe he can't get
good cell service

12:43.750 --> 12:45.834
"in his mother's basement."

12:45.834 --> 12:47.000
Huh?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.709
One sec.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.917
Perhaps if she had taken
the time to listen to my side

12:51.917 --> 12:54.417
we would have a fun story
to laugh about later.

12:54.417 --> 12:56.166
But instead she jumped
to conclusions

12:56.166 --> 12:58.291
so she would have a good story
for her blog.

13:00.875 --> 13:01.917
Yeah, that's- that's good.

13:01.917 --> 13:03.041
More of that.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.083
Stop hitting refresh.

13:14.083 --> 13:17.166
Well, how else are we gonna
know if he posts something?

13:21.291 --> 13:22.375
I think we'll know.

13:22.375 --> 13:23.834
Refresh.

13:27.750 --> 13:31.625
Oh, he did NOT call you
self-absorbed.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.083
The handle came off
the bathroom door?

13:33.083 --> 13:35.792
Well, I didn't know that.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.250
"Jump to conclusions"?

13:39.250 --> 13:40.709
Well, he has a point,
I guess.

13:40.709 --> 13:41.333
No, he doesn't.

13:41.333 --> 13:42.875
He's the bad guy.

13:42.875 --> 13:45.000
If what he's saying is true,
there is no bad guy.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.208
You have to write a rebuttal.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.041
Ok, I'm putting an end
to this right now.

14:09.166 --> 14:09.959
Hey.

14:09.959 --> 14:11.750
Um, I'll see you guys later.

14:11.750 --> 14:12.583
Hi.

14:12.583 --> 14:13.250
Hey.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.458
Sorry to barge in unannounced.

14:14.458 --> 14:15.834
No, no, no. That's ok.

14:15.834 --> 14:16.834
How'd you get back?

14:16.834 --> 14:18.667
Uh, the receptionist read
both our columns,

14:18.667 --> 14:19.625
she's taking my side.

14:19.625 --> 14:20.792
Ok, got it.

14:20.792 --> 14:21.959
Wanna sit?

14:21.959 --> 14:22.542
Sure.

14:22.542 --> 14:23.834
Ok.

14:24.959 --> 14:27.583
Listen, I read your post.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.542
You were actually a lot nicer
about the whole thing

14:29.542 --> 14:31.041
than I thought you would be.

14:31.041 --> 14:32.917
I mean, I called you
self-absorbed and clueless.

14:32.917 --> 14:34.875
I called you vain
and entitled, so...

14:34.875 --> 14:36.333
Yeah.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.792
I wanted to apologize
for jumping to conclusions.

14:38.792 --> 14:40.917
I should have let you explain.

14:40.917 --> 14:41.834
That's ok.

14:41.834 --> 14:46.000
You know, and I wanted to
apologize for, well, everything.

14:47.208 --> 14:48.375
Apology accepted.

14:48.375 --> 14:48.917
Great.

14:48.917 --> 14:50.125
Truce?

14:50.125 --> 14:51.542
Truce.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.166
Ok, so I'm going to go back
to chronicling

14:55.166 --> 14:56.375
other people's bad dates.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.333
And I'll go back to writing
about the latest trendy topic

14:58.333 --> 15:01.083
that everyone will forget
about by tomorrow afternoon.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.458
And we can both just forget
this ever happened.

15:03.458 --> 15:04.917
Sounds like a plan to me.

15:04.917 --> 15:05.792
Ok.

15:05.792 --> 15:07.750
Well, I better go.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.166
Ok.

15:09.166 --> 15:10.959
Thanks for stopping by.

15:10.959 --> 15:12.375
Yeah.

15:28.875 --> 15:31.125
Hey. How'd it go?

15:31.125 --> 15:31.959
He was fine.

15:31.959 --> 15:33.041
We made peace.

15:33.041 --> 15:34.333
Well, you are a much
better person than I am

15:34.333 --> 15:35.834
because I'm still ready for war.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.417
Nobody messes
with my friends.

15:37.417 --> 15:39.250
I've been responding to comments
on his post for hours

15:39.250 --> 15:41.041
just to work out
some aggression.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.583
Just let it go.

15:42.583 --> 15:43.583
If I can, you can.

15:43.583 --> 15:44.500
You're right.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.875
Absolutely right.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.917
You've already opened the laptop
again, haven't you?

15:57.917 --> 15:59.166
Yeah.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.291
"Sounds like this Bad Date
Chronicle girl

16:03.291 --> 16:07.208
"needs to go on a date
with a real man"?

16:07.208 --> 16:10.583
I guess I can't expect more
from someone with a screen name

16:10.583 --> 16:14.125
of Muscleman1988,

16:14.125 --> 16:17.125
but maybe if you got out of
the gym every now and then

16:17.125 --> 16:22.166
you'd be able to deal with real
women instead of just girls.

16:22.166 --> 16:25.250
Signed, FoodieFan86.

16:39.291 --> 16:40.959
Private chat?

16:43.333 --> 16:47.542
Ok, singlesurfer87, what do
you want to say to me?

16:47.542 --> 16:51.208
"Foodiefan88 I couldn't
agree more.

16:51.208 --> 16:55.417
"Men like Muscleman88
give men a bad name.

16:55.417 --> 16:57.583
"Ps. I'm a fan of food, too.

16:57.583 --> 16:58.417
"What's your favourite?

16:58.417 --> 17:02.417
"Italian, Mexican, Chinese?"

17:02.417 --> 17:03.959
All of the above.

17:20.625 --> 17:21.709
Alison Richards.

17:21.709 --> 17:24.083
Still answering your own phone,
huh Alison?

17:24.083 --> 17:26.333
Trying to prove you're
a woman of the people?

17:26.333 --> 17:27.916
Milo Peters.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.291
How are things going over
at that little blog of yours?

17:30.291 --> 17:32.041
Not so little anymore.

17:32.041 --> 17:34.542
One of our posts just hit
15 million views.

17:34.542 --> 17:36.750
Really? I didn't know that
many people

17:36.750 --> 17:38.667
in your target
audience could read.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.750
Apparently about a million more
than yours.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.625
It seems people are siding
with my trends guy

17:42.625 --> 17:44.333
over your bad date woman.

17:44.333 --> 17:45.625
No accounting for taste.

17:45.625 --> 17:48.458
Same old Alison,
beautiful but ruthless.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.125
Same old Milo.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.041
Do women really fall
for that kind of line?

17:52.041 --> 17:52.750
You did.

17:52.750 --> 17:53.917
Once.

17:53.917 --> 17:55.000
We went on one date.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.291
It was horrible.

17:56.291 --> 17:57.250
It wasn't that bad.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.500
I have had surgeries
less painful.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.750
Is there something I can do
for you, Milo?

18:01.750 --> 18:04.500
Actually I was thinking we could
help each other.

18:06.625 --> 18:07.792
I'm listening.

18:07.792 --> 18:10.333
It's obvious these posts
are connecting with people,

18:10.333 --> 18:11.500
and I'm not gonna lie.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.125
15 million views is the biggest
thing we've ever seen

18:14.125 --> 18:18.583
and I'm guessing 14 million
is for you, too.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.333
I can neither confirm
or deny that.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.458
You just did.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.959
So it seems it's in our
mutual best interest

18:23.959 --> 18:28.500
to try and keep
this thing going.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.250
What did you have in mind?

18:30.250 --> 18:31.250
You want me to what?

18:31.250 --> 18:32.250
Go out with him again.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.583
Like a do-over.

18:33.583 --> 18:35.041
A do-over?

18:35.041 --> 18:36.208
Woah, woah, woah.

18:36.208 --> 18:37.750
Ok, Milo, let me get
this straight.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.625
You, my boss, want me,
your employee,

18:39.625 --> 18:41.166
to go out with a girl for work?

18:41.166 --> 18:42.542
I'm not asking you
to marry her,

18:42.542 --> 18:44.291
just go out for dinner with her
once or twice.

18:44.291 --> 18:44.834
Wait, wha-

18:44.834 --> 18:45.750
twice?

18:45.750 --> 18:46.917
Let's make it three times.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.458
You want me to go on
three dates with him?

18:48.458 --> 18:51.000
Leigh, look at it like
public service.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.875
Your dates help our readers,
good or bad.

18:53.875 --> 18:56.125
Yes, and then you both write
your respective columns.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.250
You want me to review my date?

18:57.250 --> 18:59.041
However it turns out,
good or bad.

18:59.041 --> 19:00.291
Besides, Conner,

19:00.291 --> 19:02.083
this is the kind of thing
that could make your career.

19:02.083 --> 19:03.208
I mean, come on.

19:03.208 --> 19:06.125
This is styles and trends,
and this is definitely trending.

19:06.125 --> 19:08.834
We're talking national
attention here.

19:08.834 --> 19:10.625
You don't want to be editing

19:10.625 --> 19:12.208
for the rest of your life,
do you?

19:12.208 --> 19:13.417
I want to be a news editor.

19:13.417 --> 19:14.542
Serious content.

19:14.542 --> 19:16.625
I don't see how this gets me
any closer to that.

19:16.625 --> 19:18.250
Well, you just happen to be
talking to somebody

19:18.250 --> 19:20.208
that hires editors.

19:21.875 --> 19:24.333
She's expecting your call.

19:24.333 --> 19:25.625
He'll call you.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.250
Thank you.

20:01.709 --> 20:03.667
You are not going
to believe this.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.166
I don't believe it.

20:05.166 --> 20:06.208
Are you gonna do it?

20:06.208 --> 20:07.792
I don't know if I have
a choice.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.709
She can't make you go out
on a date with him.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.667
Three dates.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.834
And yes she can,
she's our boss!

20:12.834 --> 20:14.583
I mean obviously I'd love
for my career to be bigger

20:14.583 --> 20:16.667
but I don't know if this is
the way I want it to happen.

20:16.667 --> 20:17.834
Well, maybe it won't be
so bad.

20:17.834 --> 20:19.709
I mean, you said you kinda
made up with her, right?

20:19.709 --> 20:21.291
I only went over there
because I was convinced

20:21.291 --> 20:24.000
I'd never have to see him again.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.667
Ugh.

20:42.625 --> 20:45.166
You are such a creature
of habit.

20:45.166 --> 20:48.000
Same coffee shop, same time,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.917
and I'm guessing same coffee,
yep.

20:51.917 --> 20:52.959
I don't come here every day.

20:52.959 --> 20:55.834
Alison, I worked with you
for over two years.

20:55.834 --> 20:59.667
You think there isn't a single
thing I don't know about you?

20:59.667 --> 21:00.625
What do you want, Milo?

21:00.625 --> 21:03.041
Well, just checking in,
seeing if you're ready

21:03.041 --> 21:05.417
for our big date tonight.

21:05.417 --> 21:07.417
Oh, is that tonight?

21:07.417 --> 21:09.208
Let me guess, you forgot
all about it?

21:09.208 --> 21:11.166
Totally slipped my mind.

21:11.166 --> 21:12.834
Well, maybe we need to make this

21:12.834 --> 21:15.834
a little bit more interesting
for you then.

21:15.834 --> 21:18.750
Go on.

21:18.750 --> 21:22.000
I'm thinking a little wager.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.959
Whoever gets the most
post views wins.

21:24.959 --> 21:26.125
Wins what?

21:26.125 --> 21:27.542
One dollar.

21:27.542 --> 21:30.000
Oh, times a little tough
over at Peters Post?

21:30.000 --> 21:33.500
It's symbolic,
because I think losing

21:33.500 --> 21:38.458
will drive you crazy
no matter what it is.

21:38.458 --> 21:41.458
Ok, you're on.

21:41.458 --> 21:42.458
But no interference.

21:42.458 --> 21:43.375
What do you mean?

21:43.375 --> 21:45.291
Well, it's in our interest
for these dates to go poorly.

21:45.291 --> 21:46.583
Whatever happens, happens.

21:46.583 --> 21:49.000
We stay out of it.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.500
Deal.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.125
So do you know where
they're going tonight?

21:53.125 --> 21:54.750
Hmm.

21:54.750 --> 21:56.917
It's a do-over date so I believe
they're heading back

21:56.917 --> 21:59.834
to the scene of the crime,
Il Tempo.

21:59.834 --> 22:01.166
And who's idea was that?

22:01.166 --> 22:02.500
You know, I'd like
my dollar bill

22:02.500 --> 22:06.041
to have nice, crisp,
sharp corners.

22:06.041 --> 22:07.333
Please and thank you.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.667
Enjoy your coffee.

22:09.667 --> 22:12.041
I will.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.041
You have nothing to eat.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.041
Well, you invited yourself over,

22:30.041 --> 22:31.458
you should have brought
your own food.

22:31.458 --> 22:32.250
Which tie?

22:32.250 --> 22:32.959
For what?

22:32.959 --> 22:35.750
The job interview you have
to go on if you mess this up?

22:35.750 --> 22:36.792
How is that helpful?

22:36.792 --> 22:38.667
Just relax, you know.

22:38.667 --> 22:40.542
Try and be yourself.

22:40.542 --> 22:42.291
You always know what to say.

22:42.291 --> 22:43.041
Ok, look.

22:43.041 --> 22:44.125
If absolutely nothing else,

22:44.125 --> 22:46.875
just view this as like practice,
you know?

22:46.875 --> 22:48.917
It's been a long time
since Amy.

22:48.917 --> 22:50.458
Yeah, well, it takes a while
to get over

22:50.458 --> 22:52.208
having your heart stomped on.

22:52.208 --> 22:54.250
But you're dating again,
so that's progress.

22:54.250 --> 22:54.959
No, no, no.

22:54.959 --> 22:55.792
This is not a date, Brad.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.959
This is being forced by
my boss to go out for dinner

22:57.959 --> 23:00.583
with a woman for work,
and you know what?

23:00.583 --> 23:02.208
I feel cheap.

23:02.208 --> 23:03.750
Yeah, ok, that is
a little weird,

23:03.750 --> 23:06.625
but that first one, that,
that was a real date.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.208
And look how that turned out.

23:08.208 --> 23:10.625
Ok, I'm ready.

23:10.625 --> 23:11.792
Wish me luck.

23:11.792 --> 23:12.583
You don't need luck.

23:12.583 --> 23:13.417
Oh, thanks man.

23:13.417 --> 23:14.417
I meant all you have to do

23:14.417 --> 23:16.083
is just not set someone else
on fire.

23:16.083 --> 23:17.834
It's kind of a low bar,
you know?

23:18.959 --> 23:20.709
Don't forget, she writes BAD
Date Chronicles.

23:20.709 --> 23:23.125
Very funny.

23:23.125 --> 23:24.959
Wish you had some food.

23:33.583 --> 23:35.333
How do I look?

23:35.333 --> 23:36.959
Perfect.

23:36.959 --> 23:39.083
It's a little chilly though,
do you want to borrow a sweater?

23:39.083 --> 23:40.083
Is it fireproof?

23:40.083 --> 23:41.417
Right. Sorry.

23:41.417 --> 23:42.709
Never mind.

23:42.709 --> 23:44.208
I can't believe I'm so nervous.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.500
It's not even a real date.

23:45.500 --> 23:46.792
I'm sure it'll be fine.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.291
Maybe you'll even have some fun.

23:48.291 --> 23:51.250
Fun, on a date,
does that ever happen?

23:51.250 --> 23:53.917
Wow, he really did a number
on you, didn't he?

23:53.917 --> 23:55.417
Who?

23:55.417 --> 23:56.542
You know...

23:56.542 --> 23:57.458
Oh.

23:57.458 --> 23:58.917
Yeah.

23:58.917 --> 24:01.667
Well, he broke my heart.

24:01.667 --> 24:03.041
Actually, it was more than that.

24:03.041 --> 24:07.583
He made me feel like...
like I wasn't good enough.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.792
But you are, you know.

24:09.792 --> 24:11.583
You're amazing.

24:11.583 --> 24:12.667
Stop it.

24:12.667 --> 24:13.792
You're gonna make
my mascara run

24:13.792 --> 24:17.917
and you know how much
I hate female clichÃ©s.

24:17.917 --> 24:19.625
Call me if you need
to be rescued.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.917
Or, you know, if he wrecks
the date on purpose.

24:21.917 --> 24:23.834
Thanks for that.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.291
Hi.

24:41.291 --> 24:41.959
Hello.

24:41.959 --> 24:42.875
You're here.

24:42.875 --> 24:44.458
You sound surprised.

24:44.458 --> 24:45.542
Sorry.

24:45.542 --> 24:47.667
This is a little uh... weird,
huh?

24:47.667 --> 24:48.834
Yeah. Very weird.

24:48.834 --> 24:50.166
I mean, I've been set-up
by co-workers before

24:50.166 --> 24:51.458
but this is ridiculous.

24:51.458 --> 24:53.125
Exactly. Yeah.

24:54.208 --> 24:55.917
Well, shall we?

24:55.917 --> 24:57.834
Oh, we have a reservation?

24:57.834 --> 25:00.458
Uh, I sounded surprised again,
didn't I?

25:00.458 --> 25:01.834
I heard it that time.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.208
Sorry.

25:03.208 --> 25:05.208
I'm going to see if our table
is ready.

25:06.959 --> 25:07.709
Good evening, sir.

25:07.709 --> 25:08.667
How may I assist you?

25:08.667 --> 25:09.709
Hi. Hi.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.458
I have a reservation for 830.

25:12.458 --> 25:14.667
Conner Michaels.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.417
Uh, yes.

25:16.417 --> 25:17.875
Here it is.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.792
Table for two.

25:19.792 --> 25:21.542
945 p.m.

25:21.542 --> 25:22.792
No. No, no, no.

25:22.792 --> 25:24.959
I made the reservation
for 830.

25:24.959 --> 25:25.792
No, sir.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.250
See, it was 830.

25:27.250 --> 25:29.750
It was moved to 945 p.m.

25:29.750 --> 25:31.000
Moved by who?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.709
Well, I'm sure I don't know,
sir.

25:36.208 --> 25:37.959
Il Tempo.

25:41.208 --> 25:43.375
Trying to tank the date.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.041
Ok.

25:45.041 --> 25:46.333
Ok, I see how it is.

25:46.333 --> 25:47.500
Hi.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.917
What will it take to move
the reservation to 830?

26:06.333 --> 26:10.291
Private message
from singlesurfer87.

26:10.291 --> 26:13.125
"What do you think
of the recipe?"

26:13.125 --> 26:15.000
I'm not done yet.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.834
The pasta is still boiling.

26:22.250 --> 26:24.166
"This is my family's
secret recipe.

26:24.166 --> 26:28.291
"If you mess it up I'll never
forgive myself for sharing it."

26:28.291 --> 26:31.333
Well, then stop
chatting me.

26:31.333 --> 26:35.500
I can't type and cook
at the same time.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.125
"You've got two hands."

27:02.333 --> 27:04.291
Thank you.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.125
Do you think they remember us?

27:09.375 --> 27:10.875
I'm thinking yes.

27:13.417 --> 27:15.542
So.

27:15.542 --> 27:18.625
So.

27:18.625 --> 27:21.208
I- I literally have no idea
what to say right now.

27:21.208 --> 27:24.041
Yeah, me neither.

27:24.041 --> 27:25.041
I have a question.

27:25.041 --> 27:26.542
Can I ask you something?

27:26.542 --> 27:28.125
Sure.

27:28.125 --> 27:31.417
Did you- and look, don't take
this the wrong way, but...

27:31.417 --> 27:32.500
did you want to do this?

27:32.500 --> 27:35.333
This whole he said
she said date thing?

27:35.333 --> 27:38.166
Well, I- I mean, I thought
it was a cute idea.

27:38.166 --> 27:39.250
But it wasn't your idea.

27:39.250 --> 27:41.041
No.

27:41.041 --> 27:44.125
I didn't mean for that to sound
so emphatic.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.083
No, it's ok.

27:45.083 --> 27:46.291
Look, it wasn't my idea, either.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.417
It was my boss.

27:47.417 --> 27:48.083
It wasn't me!

27:48.083 --> 27:49.375
It was all Alison.

27:49.375 --> 27:50.375
So you didn't want to be here,
either?

27:50.375 --> 27:53.375
No! And I did mean to say
that emphatically.

27:53.375 --> 27:55.542
Well, then, there-
look at that.

27:55.542 --> 27:56.625
We both have something
in common.

27:56.625 --> 27:58.333
Neither of us wants to be
on this date.

27:58.333 --> 27:59.583
And we both have crazy bosses.

27:59.583 --> 28:00.250
You know what?

28:00.250 --> 28:01.375
I will drink to that.

28:01.375 --> 28:02.041
Cheers.

28:02.041 --> 28:03.458
Cheers.

28:06.375 --> 28:07.166
Yes, you're in luck.

28:07.166 --> 28:09.083
Something just opened up
in three months.

28:09.083 --> 28:10.250
Mmmhmm.

28:10.250 --> 28:11.458
Ok.

28:11.458 --> 28:14.250
Alright, I'll talk to you soon.

28:14.250 --> 28:15.125
May I help you, sir?

28:15.125 --> 28:16.667
What? Oh, no, I'm good.

28:20.875 --> 28:22.417
Actually, do you mind
maybe just...

28:22.417 --> 28:25.250
just a little to your left?

28:25.250 --> 28:26.250
Hmm.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.709
Yes, I do mind.

28:34.542 --> 28:37.500
You're not the only one
who can talk on a phone.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.250
Milo speaking.

28:39.250 --> 28:42.625
Milo, are you interrupting
Leigh and Conner's date?

28:42.625 --> 28:43.959
What? No, of course not.

28:43.959 --> 28:44.750
Really?

28:44.750 --> 28:46.917
The maÃ®tre d' obviously thinks
you are.

29:01.417 --> 29:02.542
What are you doing here?

29:02.542 --> 29:03.667
What are YOU doing here?

29:03.667 --> 29:05.166
Protecting my investment.

29:05.166 --> 29:06.583
From the lobby?

29:06.583 --> 29:08.208
I'm surprised you don't have
a table here.

29:08.208 --> 29:08.917
I did.

29:08.917 --> 29:11.041
They weren't supposed
to be seated this early.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.500
You changed the reservation.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.667
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:13.667 --> 29:14.750
What else did you do?

29:14.750 --> 29:15.959
Nothing.

29:18.166 --> 29:20.792
What did you do?

29:20.792 --> 29:22.375
Nothing.

29:26.750 --> 29:28.709
You look amazing,
by the way.

29:28.709 --> 29:31.959
Thank you.

29:31.959 --> 29:33.166
I like the suit.

29:33.166 --> 29:36.000
Thank you. It's Italian.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.792
Anyway, I need to use
the ladies' room.

29:38.792 --> 29:40.041
Oh, good.

29:40.041 --> 29:43.500
Because I have to go
to the lit-

29:43.500 --> 29:44.333
I have to go to the car.

29:44.333 --> 29:46.041
For something in the car.

30:38.834 --> 30:40.208
So I guess we should do
all the first date stuff

30:40.208 --> 30:42.458
that we didn't get to do
last time, right?

30:42.458 --> 30:43.041
Right.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.875
Like where we're from,
family,

30:44.875 --> 30:46.709
how long we've lived here
type stuff.

30:46.709 --> 30:47.500
The basics.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.125
Ok, well, I'm from-

30:50.583 --> 30:55.208
Sorry, I- I forgot to turn
the ringer off.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.875
Oh, no, go ahead.

31:00.583 --> 31:01.333
Right.

31:01.333 --> 31:02.667
Well, uh, I am from-

31:04.041 --> 31:05.583
Sorry.

31:06.542 --> 31:08.792
I'm sorry, I'm- I'm just
gonna turn it off.

31:13.917 --> 31:15.625
Ok, we should- we should
be good now.

31:15.625 --> 31:16.583
So, you were saying?

31:16.583 --> 31:18.333
Yes, I was saying
that I'm from-

31:18.333 --> 31:21.917
Miss Ryness, there's a call
for you at the front desk.

31:21.917 --> 31:22.750
Really?

31:22.750 --> 31:24.250
Mmmhmm.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.667
That's... that's weird.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.709
I better take it.

31:28.709 --> 31:30.000
Of course. Go ahead.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.709
Right this way.

31:36.417 --> 31:37.458
There you are.

31:37.458 --> 31:39.625
Thanks.

31:39.625 --> 31:40.875
Hello?

31:41.959 --> 31:43.625
Hello?

31:43.625 --> 31:44.500
Excuse me?

31:44.500 --> 31:46.375
There's nobody there.

31:46.375 --> 31:47.667
Really?

31:47.667 --> 31:48.917
There was just a moment ago.

31:48.917 --> 31:51.417
Said it was your brother,
and that it was urgent.

31:51.417 --> 31:52.917
I don't have a brother.

31:52.917 --> 31:54.667
Hmm.

31:54.667 --> 31:57.208
I don't suppose he said his name
was Brad, did he?

31:57.208 --> 31:58.875
He didn't leave a name.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.542
Excuse me.

32:09.500 --> 32:10.542
So.

32:10.542 --> 32:13.166
You need this date to go bad
too, huh?

32:13.166 --> 32:15.083
I'm onto you, buddy.

32:19.875 --> 32:21.166
A call from her brother.

32:21.166 --> 32:23.417
Mmmhmm. I see.

32:23.417 --> 32:26.291
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

32:26.291 --> 32:28.542
Ok, this means war.

33:03.083 --> 33:04.875
Well, this has been...

33:04.875 --> 33:07.583
Yeah, just...

33:07.583 --> 33:08.792
Maybe we should...

33:08.792 --> 33:09.917
I think so.

33:09.917 --> 33:10.875
But hey, look at it this way.

33:10.875 --> 33:13.083
At least nothing burst
into flames.

33:13.083 --> 33:16.709
Sir, as requested,
our signature dessert.

33:16.709 --> 33:18.333
Dessert?

33:18.333 --> 33:20.208
Dessert?

33:20.625 --> 33:22.834
Yes. Cherries jubilee.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.208
Oh man.

33:31.208 --> 33:32.291
"I'm not 100 percent sure

33:32.291 --> 33:34.875
"but I think he might be
trying to kill me.

33:34.875 --> 33:38.917
"I should check my will to make
sure he's not a beneficiary."

33:38.917 --> 33:42.125
Wow. This is worse
than the original.

33:42.125 --> 33:43.333
I didn't order that dessert.

33:43.333 --> 33:44.625
This is so great.

33:44.625 --> 33:45.667
Great? Why is it great?

33:45.667 --> 33:48.792
Because your version has
twice as many hits as hers does.

33:48.792 --> 33:49.500
We're winning.

33:49.500 --> 33:50.500
It's totally worth the effort.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.834
What effort?

33:51.834 --> 33:55.125
The effort... it takes to build
a company

33:55.125 --> 33:57.667
and hire brilliant editors
like you guys.

33:57.667 --> 34:00.792
Good stuff.

34:00.792 --> 34:02.792
Well, that was weird.

34:02.792 --> 34:04.125
Yeah, this is weird.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.083
In your blog you said

34:06.083 --> 34:08.417
"I have no way of proving
that she sets of fake calls

34:08.417 --> 34:09.667
"to interrupt the date,

34:09.667 --> 34:13.041
"but if a bad date plot fits,
wear it."

34:13.041 --> 34:14.375
You really think she had her
roommate page her

34:14.375 --> 34:15.333
at the front desk?

34:15.333 --> 34:17.667
I don't know who else
it could have been.

34:23.208 --> 34:26.166
MyraB wants to know
why Conner hates women.

34:26.166 --> 34:27.417
Who's MyraB?

34:27.417 --> 34:29.542
One of the people commenting
on your article.

34:29.542 --> 34:30.542
Why are you reading those?

34:30.542 --> 34:32.708
Everyone who posts
on there is crazy.

34:32.708 --> 34:33.958
They're not all crazy.

34:33.958 --> 34:35.083
Well, I'll tell you what
is crazy.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.542
That Conner really thinks
I did all this

34:36.542 --> 34:38.375
just to make the date go badly.

34:38.375 --> 34:39.458
I think the operative word

34:39.458 --> 34:42.041
in the title Bad Date
Chronicles is "bad".

34:42.041 --> 34:43.291
Besides, it's what you said
he did.

34:43.291 --> 34:44.583
I know that's what he did.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.792
Maybe he's trying
to divert suspicion.

34:46.792 --> 34:47.708
This is ridiculous!

34:47.708 --> 34:49.083
I went through all of that
and he's still getting

34:49.083 --> 34:50.917
more views than I am.

34:50.917 --> 34:52.250
How's Alison taking it?

34:52.250 --> 34:53.583
She's ready to explode.

34:53.583 --> 34:55.583
If I don't find a way to get
the page views up somehow,

34:55.583 --> 34:57.709
I don't know what
she's gonna do.

35:04.667 --> 35:05.458
Alison Richards.

35:05.458 --> 35:06.542
Double or nothing?

35:07.959 --> 35:09.583
You're on.

35:29.709 --> 35:31.458
Hi.

35:31.458 --> 35:33.375
Your office said I could find
you here.

35:33.375 --> 35:34.500
I'm uh, I'm Brad.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.750
Conner's friend.

35:35.750 --> 35:37.291
I remember who you are.

35:37.291 --> 35:39.083
If you're looking for Leigh
she's not here.

35:39.083 --> 35:39.834
I'm not here to talk to Leigh,

35:39.834 --> 35:40.959
I'm here to talk to you.

35:40.959 --> 35:41.709
Why?

35:41.709 --> 35:43.583
Because you're the one
helping Leigh tank their dates.

35:43.583 --> 35:44.625
What are you talking about?

35:44.625 --> 35:45.959
I haven't tanked anything.

35:45.959 --> 35:47.709
Oh, so that wasn't you
calling her a hundred times?

35:47.709 --> 35:48.834
Of course not.

35:51.041 --> 35:52.875
Their second date is tonight.

35:52.875 --> 35:55.083
All I'm asking is that
you just stay out of it.

35:55.083 --> 35:56.125
I'm not in it.

35:56.125 --> 35:57.208
Maybe you should stay
out of it.

35:57.208 --> 35:59.542
Maybe you're the one
making Conner look bad.

35:59.542 --> 36:03.041
Look. I know you
don't like Conner

36:03.041 --> 36:11.291
but he's actually a really good
guy and he's been hurt, ok?

36:11.291 --> 36:15.125
His last relationship was...

36:15.125 --> 36:16.208
it took him a really long time

36:16.208 --> 36:21.208
to where he felt like
he could trust anyone, so...

36:21.208 --> 36:25.000
just stay out of it. Ok?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.625
Leigh was hurt, too.

36:27.625 --> 36:31.083
So bad that she won't even
let me say his name around her.

36:31.083 --> 36:34.959
The Bad Date Chronicles
isn't just a job for her.

36:34.959 --> 36:38.709
It's her way of feeling
a little less... alone.

36:40.625 --> 36:42.583
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:42.583 --> 36:43.875
I'm sorry, too.

36:43.875 --> 36:44.917
For him.

36:44.917 --> 36:47.458
Just let them have their date.
Ok?

37:08.500 --> 37:10.667
I really need to find a new
place to go for coffee.

37:10.667 --> 37:13.333
When are you gonna let this feud
between us go?

37:13.333 --> 37:15.583
When you admit what you did.

37:15.583 --> 37:16.667
What did I do?

37:16.667 --> 37:17.750
You know.

37:17.750 --> 37:19.000
What?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.166
Start my own company?

37:20.166 --> 37:21.625
Want something for myself?

37:21.625 --> 37:24.000
Is this what you've been angry
about for the last couple years?

37:24.000 --> 37:25.834
Why did you come here, Milo?

37:25.834 --> 37:30.000
Well, I was re-reading our
blog postings, both of them,

37:30.000 --> 37:34.834
and I was actually feeling
a little bit...

37:34.834 --> 37:36.667
guilty about what we did.

37:36.667 --> 37:39.041
You? Guilty?

37:39.041 --> 37:41.875
Is this being recorded for
one of those prank shows?

37:41.875 --> 37:43.959
Alison, I'm serious.

37:43.959 --> 37:46.750
Look, our sites may not be
New York Times,

37:46.750 --> 37:50.083
but should still have some level
of journalistic integrity,

37:50.083 --> 37:51.041
don't you think?

37:51.041 --> 37:53.208
Messing with the love lives
of two innocent people

37:53.208 --> 37:54.458
for our own personal gain

37:54.458 --> 37:56.917
is about as far from integrity
as you can get.

38:01.667 --> 38:04.000
I hate it when you're right.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.542
So tonight the date goes
how it goes,

38:08.542 --> 38:11.750
good or bad, we stay out of it.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.500
Agreed?

38:13.500 --> 38:15.166
Agreed.

38:16.458 --> 38:19.542
You know you're beautiful
when you compromise.

38:19.542 --> 38:21.291
Go away.

38:21.291 --> 38:23.250
Enjoy your coffee.

38:33.333 --> 38:34.041
This is insane.

38:34.041 --> 38:35.375
He's just gonna try to mess
with me again

38:35.375 --> 38:36.542
like he did last time.

38:36.542 --> 38:38.041
Well, then you mess
with him first.

38:38.041 --> 38:40.625
Yeah, but doesn't that make
me just as bad as he is?

38:40.625 --> 38:41.834
Leigh, you have to make
a choice.

38:41.834 --> 38:46.291
Either take control or stay
here and hang out on the couch.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.834
Our couch is really comfortable.

38:48.834 --> 38:52.041
Take control. Ok?

38:52.041 --> 38:53.792
Ok.

38:57.959 --> 38:59.709
I don't know what you're
so freaked out about.

38:59.709 --> 39:00.500
I'm going out on a date
with someone

39:00.500 --> 39:01.834
who thinks I'm trying
to kill her.

39:01.834 --> 39:03.166
She doesn't really think that,

39:03.166 --> 39:05.583
she just thinks you're trying
to sabotage your dates.

39:07.166 --> 39:08.458
You know what,
maybe you should

39:08.458 --> 39:09.041
What? Why?

39:09.041 --> 39:10.041
Because otherwise
you're gonna end up

39:10.041 --> 39:13.709
playing defense all night.

39:13.709 --> 39:17.417
Don't let her take advantage
of you like...

39:17.417 --> 39:19.417
Like Amy did.

39:19.417 --> 39:20.250
Yeah.

39:22.917 --> 39:25.542
You know what?

39:25.542 --> 39:27.375
No more playing defense.

39:40.458 --> 39:42.208
Sorry I'm late.

39:42.208 --> 39:42.959
I just got here.

39:42.959 --> 39:44.083
Yeah, so did I.

39:44.083 --> 39:45.500
So we're both late.

39:45.500 --> 39:48.834
Yeah, we missed the start
of the movie.

39:48.834 --> 39:50.709
Ok, so what's plan B?

39:50.709 --> 39:51.750
Well, I mean, I was thinking
we could take

39:51.750 --> 39:53.333
a paddle boat ride
on the lake.

39:53.333 --> 39:57.041
Lake? No, no lakes.

39:57.041 --> 39:59.083
Uh, maybe we could
just get coffee?

39:59.083 --> 40:00.000
Oh, coffee huh?

40:00.000 --> 40:00.875
A room full of hot liquids?

40:00.875 --> 40:03.000
No, no, no. I don't think so.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.542
But there is a bar around
the corner that has karaoke.

40:05.542 --> 40:07.083
So I can embarrass myself
in public?

40:07.083 --> 40:08.333
No thank you.

40:08.333 --> 40:09.333
Ice skating?

40:09.333 --> 40:11.041
No, I don't want to end up
in a cast, no, no.

40:11.041 --> 40:13.375
So what're we gonna do?

40:13.375 --> 40:14.917
Maybe we could just...

40:14.917 --> 40:18.834
I don't know, go for a walk
or something?

40:18.834 --> 40:20.333
A walk?

40:20.333 --> 40:22.625
It'd be fun.

40:22.625 --> 40:24.000
Ok.

40:26.458 --> 40:27.500
Yeah.

41:02.166 --> 41:03.333
Woah.

41:59.792 --> 42:02.000
So how'd you get involved
with Bad Date Chronicles?

42:02.000 --> 42:04.709
Uh, happenstance mainly.

42:04.709 --> 42:07.250
I got hired to be a copy editor
for the site

42:07.250 --> 42:09.208
but then I had this really,
really epic break-up

42:09.208 --> 42:10.750
around the time they were
looking for someone

42:10.750 --> 42:12.542
to run the blog.

42:12.542 --> 42:13.834
It seemed like a natural fit.

42:13.834 --> 42:15.917
Had a few bad dates yourself,
huh?

42:15.917 --> 42:17.792
I mean, other than ours.

42:17.792 --> 42:20.500
More like bad relationships.

42:20.500 --> 42:22.625
I kinda just wanted to forget
about it.

42:22.625 --> 42:24.667
Work on something happy
and upbeat

42:24.667 --> 42:25.959
but the site didn't have a blog

42:25.959 --> 42:27.917
for puppies and rainbows,
so...

42:32.750 --> 42:34.667
How about you and trends?

42:34.667 --> 42:36.041
You know, in a way
it was the same thing.

42:36.041 --> 42:38.542
I was writing a sports blog,
went through a bad break-up

42:38.542 --> 42:42.792
and just decided that I needed
to write about something else.

42:42.792 --> 42:44.125
Why?

42:44.125 --> 42:45.792
Oh, did I not tell you that
she was a sports caster

42:45.792 --> 42:47.166
of a local TV station?

42:47.166 --> 42:49.917
Ah. Continue.

42:49.917 --> 42:52.375
So my college buddy, Brad,
hooked me up with this gig

42:52.375 --> 42:55.041
at The Peters Post by telling
them that I was super trendy

42:55.041 --> 42:58.125
and cutting edge on
all the latest everything.

42:58.125 --> 42:59.125
And you weren't?

42:59.125 --> 43:02.291
No. No, my car was seven years
old and I had the same haircut

43:02.291 --> 43:03.250
since I was 15.

43:04.834 --> 43:06.792
You know that saying
"fake it 'til you make it"?

43:06.792 --> 43:07.667
Yes.

43:07.667 --> 43:09.542
Yeah, well, I was really good
at faking it.

43:11.875 --> 43:14.250
So I guess our break-ups
were good for something.

43:14.250 --> 43:15.583
They got us jobs.

43:15.583 --> 43:16.875
Yeah, I guess they did.

43:16.875 --> 43:17.875
 I mean, there's
that whole

43:17.875 --> 43:21.333
nability to trust anyone"
g to balance it out, but...

43:21.333 --> 43:22.709
 So you want to give
ice skating a try?

43:22.709 --> 43:25.250
 I will
if you will.

43:30.792 --> 43:32.083
So much for integrity.

43:32.083 --> 43:33.500
I was just watching.

43:33.500 --> 43:34.500
What are you doing here?

43:34.500 --> 43:38.333
Same. 15 million views
at stake here.

43:38.333 --> 43:39.709
Well, we don't have to worry
about that anymore.

43:39.709 --> 43:42.208
These two are on the most
boring date ever.

43:42.208 --> 43:43.375
They're on a walk-and-talk.

43:43.375 --> 43:44.375
I mean, come on!

43:44.375 --> 43:46.417
This is not Bad Date Chronicle
worthy.

43:46.417 --> 43:47.041
But what do we do?

43:47.041 --> 43:48.500
We agreed not to interfere.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.500
Yes, we did.

43:50.500 --> 43:51.625
Because that

43:51.625 --> 43:53.417
would be bad.

43:53.417 --> 43:54.583
Yeah.

43:58.834 --> 44:00.625
Although...

44:00.625 --> 44:01.750
I'm listening.

44:01.750 --> 44:04.417
A bad date is not just
in our best interest,

44:04.417 --> 44:05.625
it's also in theirs.

44:05.625 --> 44:06.542
Go on.

44:06.542 --> 44:09.709
A bad date means
more page views,

44:09.709 --> 44:12.834
which means higher profile,

44:12.834 --> 44:16.166
which means better jobs
and more money for them.

44:16.166 --> 44:17.792
This could be their
first step towards

44:17.792 --> 44:19.583
starting their own
online magazine.

44:19.583 --> 44:20.500
Exactly.

44:20.500 --> 44:21.667
We kind of owe it to them
to interfere.

44:21.667 --> 44:22.500
Yep.

44:22.500 --> 44:23.500
We are their mentors.

44:23.500 --> 44:25.291
And you know what,
mentors have integrity.

44:25.291 --> 44:26.041
Yes.

44:26.041 --> 44:27.709
So what are we waiting for?

44:29.250 --> 44:30.166
Alison?

44:30.166 --> 44:31.041
What?

44:31.041 --> 44:32.208
You're beautiful
when you compromise

44:32.208 --> 44:34.166
but you're gorgeous
when you're devious.

44:34.166 --> 44:36.834
Let's just break up a date,
please.

45:02.500 --> 45:18.834
âª

45:38.667 --> 45:41.000
Leigh, how does it feel?

45:41.000 --> 45:42.291
How does what feel?

45:42.291 --> 45:43.750
To be a winner?

45:43.750 --> 45:45.792
Your write-up of last night's
date is out-pacing

45:45.792 --> 45:49.375
The Peters Post version
by 30 percent.

45:49.375 --> 45:51.542
We are gonna crush them
on the next date.

45:51.542 --> 45:53.875
Yeah, that's what I want
to talk to you about.

45:53.875 --> 45:56.291
I don't think there's gonna be
a next date.

45:56.291 --> 45:58.291
Why don't you have a seat?

46:05.375 --> 46:06.667
What do you mean?

46:06.667 --> 46:09.250
I mean, he can't be that bad,
can he?

46:09.250 --> 46:10.375
No, he's not.

46:10.375 --> 46:12.125
He actually seems like
a decent guy,

46:12.125 --> 46:14.208
and in between all the horrible
stuff we were having fun.

46:14.208 --> 46:14.917
But...

46:17.291 --> 46:19.667
Alison, I think another
date is gonna kill me.

46:19.667 --> 46:21.834
Leigh, I have been seeing you
in a whole new light

46:21.834 --> 46:23.333
since this all started.

46:23.333 --> 46:25.291
Smart. Funny.

46:25.291 --> 46:26.667
Talented.

46:26.667 --> 46:29.417
Wait, how did you see me before?

46:29.417 --> 46:31.000
Honestly, you were fine.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.542
Fine is fine, but
it's not amazing,

46:32.542 --> 46:34.625
and since you've been sharing
your stories

46:34.625 --> 46:36.834
you've been amazing.

46:36.834 --> 46:37.417
Really?

46:37.417 --> 46:39.959
Yes.

46:39.959 --> 46:41.667
"If he's not intentionally
trying to make these dates

46:41.667 --> 46:43.625
"a nightmare then I'm pretty
sure one of us has picked up

46:43.625 --> 46:46.375
"an ancient Tiki necklace
on a family trip to Hawaii,

46:46.375 --> 46:48.709
"because we are cursed"?

46:48.709 --> 46:50.709
That's funny.

46:50.709 --> 46:54.166
I see big things for you
at The Richards Record.

46:54.166 --> 46:55.667
But can't I write
about something else?

46:55.667 --> 46:58.041
Something that doesn't involve
the threat of imminent death?

46:58.041 --> 47:00.625
I'm sure you could,
but how are you gonna feel

47:00.625 --> 47:03.583
if you don't see this
all the way through?

47:03.583 --> 47:04.583
Relieved.

47:04.583 --> 47:06.333
Like a quitter.

47:06.333 --> 47:08.083
Nobody wants to be a quitter.

47:08.083 --> 47:11.583
I know I don't.

47:11.583 --> 47:17.667
Uh, I don't think you have as
much at stake in this as I do.

47:17.667 --> 47:19.583
You might be right.

47:23.291 --> 47:25.166
Thank you for the talk,
Leigh.

47:25.166 --> 47:27.750
I look forward to your
next write up.

47:33.041 --> 47:34.959
What just happened?

47:47.375 --> 47:49.041
Peters Post.

48:04.667 --> 48:06.000
She thinks I sank the boat.

48:06.000 --> 48:06.333
I know.

48:06.333 --> 48:07.500
But I did not sink
the boat.

48:07.500 --> 48:11.583
I know, but the boat sank
and so if I was your girlfriend-

48:11.583 --> 48:13.000
She's not my girlfriend,
ok?

48:13.000 --> 48:14.250
And it is not my fault.

48:14.250 --> 48:15.709
It's gotta be someone's fault.

48:15.709 --> 48:17.000
But it shouldn't be me, ok?

48:17.000 --> 48:19.333
Leigh is literally trying to
blame me for every single thing.

48:19.333 --> 48:21.458
I did not break
the karaoke machine

48:21.458 --> 48:24.417
and I most certainly
did not sink the boat!

48:24.417 --> 48:25.959
Do you think
your girlfriend did?

48:25.959 --> 48:27.500
Stop calling her that.

48:27.500 --> 48:28.458
I don't know, ok?

48:28.458 --> 48:30.917
It doesn't seem like her,
but it can't all be coincidence.

48:30.917 --> 48:33.417
Nobody goes on three dates
in a row like that.

48:33.417 --> 48:35.333
So what're you gonna do
about it?

48:39.417 --> 48:40.125
Where are you going?

48:40.125 --> 48:42.083
To go break up
with my girlfriend.

48:42.083 --> 48:43.041
Ah hah!

48:43.041 --> 48:44.959
I told you she was
your girlfriend!

48:56.041 --> 48:57.583
You're late.

48:57.583 --> 49:00.333
I'm not late, I'm varying
my routine.

49:00.333 --> 49:02.417
Same coffee house,
same coffee.

49:02.417 --> 49:04.500
You're just ten minutes
later than usual.

49:04.500 --> 49:05.750
I got a different drink, too.

49:05.750 --> 49:06.959
Looks the same to me.

49:06.959 --> 49:08.125
It's only half caf.

49:08.125 --> 49:10.125
You are a madwoman.

49:10.125 --> 49:11.583
Totally out of control.

49:11.583 --> 49:14.250
Anyway, I was talking
to Leigh

49:14.250 --> 49:16.917
and she made an interesting
point.

49:16.917 --> 49:18.750
What's that?

49:18.750 --> 49:20.125
That the stakes aren't
high enough for me

49:20.125 --> 49:22.750
in this little competition
we have going on.

49:22.750 --> 49:25.166
Ok. What were you thinking?

49:30.250 --> 49:31.959
Your business card?

49:31.959 --> 49:33.375
I don't think that's worth
the four dollars

49:33.375 --> 49:34.709
our double or nothing
bet is up to-

49:34.709 --> 49:36.083
Not the card.

49:36.083 --> 49:38.375
The business.

49:38.375 --> 49:40.250
I was doing a little research.

49:40.250 --> 49:42.583
The Richards Record
has women 18 - 49.

49:42.583 --> 49:45.291
Peters Post has men.

49:45.291 --> 49:48.250
Separately we do fine.

49:48.250 --> 49:52.417
But together we could
be amazing.

49:52.417 --> 49:53.834
You want us to merge?

49:53.834 --> 49:56.667
Yes.

49:56.667 --> 49:59.458
As partners?

49:59.458 --> 50:01.875
That's where the wager
comes in.

50:01.875 --> 50:04.667
If we get more hits
on the next date post,

50:04.667 --> 50:07.417
you work for me.

50:07.417 --> 50:11.875
If you get more hits,
I work for you.

50:11.875 --> 50:13.583
You're serious?

50:13.583 --> 50:17.208
Very.

50:17.208 --> 50:19.125
You're on.

50:32.333 --> 50:33.083
Conner.

50:33.083 --> 50:35.083
I can't believe you think
I'm that much of a monster.

50:35.083 --> 50:35.750
Do you mind?

50:35.750 --> 50:37.291
I- I work here.

50:40.125 --> 50:41.208
What're you talking about?

50:41.208 --> 50:43.542
Your Bad Date Chronicle
where you called me a sociopath.

50:43.542 --> 50:44.083
I did not.

50:44.083 --> 50:44.959
You may as well have.

50:44.959 --> 50:46.208
I mean, sabotage?

50:46.208 --> 50:47.375
Food tampering?

50:47.375 --> 50:48.166
Maritime disasters?

50:48.166 --> 50:49.625
If I wasn't so offended
I would be impressed

50:49.625 --> 50:51.291
that you thought I had
that much power.

50:51.291 --> 50:52.166
So, what?

50:52.166 --> 50:55.041
You just expect me to believe
all this was just happenstance?

50:55.041 --> 50:56.458
No, I don't think that at all.

50:56.458 --> 50:57.417
So I'm the sociopath?

50:57.417 --> 50:58.583
Well, if the straight
jacket fits.

50:58.583 --> 50:59.375
It wasn't me.

50:59.375 --> 51:00.583
Well, it wasn't me, either.

51:00.583 --> 51:02.959
If it wasn't you and it
wasn't me, who was it?

51:07.583 --> 51:08.792
Oh great.

51:08.792 --> 51:10.709
Uh, that's my boss.

51:10.709 --> 51:11.709
That's my boss.

51:11.709 --> 51:12.792
Wait a minute.

51:12.792 --> 51:14.000
That's Milo Peters?

51:14.000 --> 51:15.375
Yeah. That's Alison Richards?

51:15.375 --> 51:16.917
Yes.

51:16.917 --> 51:19.417
What're they doing together?

51:20.500 --> 51:22.750
 Oh.

51:31.417 --> 51:33.625
Brad?

51:33.625 --> 51:34.917
Erin.

51:34.917 --> 51:35.917
What're you doing here?

51:35.917 --> 51:37.458
I'm meeting someone.

51:37.458 --> 51:38.500
Me too.

51:38.500 --> 51:39.542
Go away.

51:39.542 --> 51:40.625
What do you mean, go away?

51:40.625 --> 51:42.125
I mean you're going to ruin it.

51:42.125 --> 51:43.083
How am I gonna ruin it?

51:43.083 --> 51:45.125
I don't know but I'm sure
you'll find a way.

51:45.125 --> 51:46.667
Well, then maybe you should go.

51:46.667 --> 51:47.709
I'm not leaving.

51:47.709 --> 51:49.250
I'm not either.

51:52.041 --> 51:53.375
Red shirt.

51:56.166 --> 51:57.709
Singlesurfer?

51:57.709 --> 51:59.208
Foodiefan?

51:59.208 --> 52:00.375
No!

52:00.375 --> 52:02.166
No!

52:06.458 --> 52:07.834
It makes so much sense.

52:07.834 --> 52:10.041
I was feeling so...

52:10.041 --> 52:10.917
Inept.

52:10.917 --> 52:11.875
Yes!

52:11.875 --> 52:13.166
Like I not only forgot
how to date

52:13.166 --> 52:14.792
but was actually
really bad at it.

52:14.792 --> 52:16.625
Like bodily harm bad.

52:16.625 --> 52:17.291
I know.

52:17.291 --> 52:19.709
I mean, I realize I shouldn't
wrap up my sense of self-worth

52:19.709 --> 52:21.917
in this stereotypical
guy thing

52:21.917 --> 52:24.083
of how women respond to me
on dates, but...

52:24.083 --> 52:25.667
But it wasn't us,
it was them.

52:25.667 --> 52:26.208
Yeah.

52:26.208 --> 52:27.083
You know what?

52:27.083 --> 52:28.000
They're the sociopaths.

52:28.000 --> 52:28.625
Yeah.

52:28.625 --> 52:29.458
They sank our boat.

52:29.458 --> 52:31.417
They lit me on fire, twice.

52:31.417 --> 52:32.041
Once.

52:32.041 --> 52:34.959
I mean, the first time was
before they got involved, but...

52:34.959 --> 52:36.959
Well, I say we blame
them anyway.

52:36.959 --> 52:38.041
That works for me.

52:40.917 --> 52:42.000
So what're we gonna do?

52:42.000 --> 52:43.458
We were supposed to go
on a date this weekend.

52:43.458 --> 52:45.125
Yeah, it's supposed to be
our last date and frankly

52:45.125 --> 52:46.875
I don't think I want to know
what they have in mind

52:46.875 --> 52:48.291
for a grand finale.

52:48.291 --> 52:51.500
Yeah, that's definitely
not gonna end well for us.

52:51.500 --> 52:53.667
Yeah.

52:53.667 --> 52:56.792
You know, unless...

52:56.792 --> 52:58.041
they can't mess with our date
if they don't know

52:58.041 --> 53:00.375
when it's happening.

53:00.375 --> 53:02.083
But they already do.

53:02.083 --> 53:03.250
Not if we change it.

53:03.250 --> 53:04.542
Oh, I like it.

53:04.542 --> 53:07.917
Change it to when?

53:07.917 --> 53:09.375
Right now?

53:11.542 --> 53:12.125
Let's do it. Let's just go.

53:12.125 --> 53:14.166
Let's go blow off the rest
of work,

53:14.166 --> 53:16.542
go completely off the record.

53:16.542 --> 53:19.208
Re-do all our bad dates
and make them good.

53:19.208 --> 53:19.875
You know?

53:19.875 --> 53:20.583
Just prove to ourselves

53:20.583 --> 53:24.625
that we're not Bad Date
Chronicles material.

53:24.625 --> 53:27.125
Let's do it.

53:27.125 --> 53:28.959
Perfect.

53:48.458 --> 53:49.750
Did you know?

53:49.750 --> 53:51.333
Know what?

53:51.333 --> 53:52.333
That I was me?

53:52.333 --> 53:53.750
That she was me?

53:53.750 --> 53:55.917
The one you were chatting-
you know what I mean.

53:55.917 --> 53:58.125
No, I- we talked about Leigh
and Conner's dates

53:58.125 --> 54:00.458
and you never said anything
about knowing them.

54:00.458 --> 54:02.500
I wanted to know
what you really thought.

54:02.500 --> 54:06.667
I figured if you knew I knew
her you'd censor your answers.

54:06.667 --> 54:09.208
Yeah, me too.

54:09.208 --> 54:13.250
But you defended Leigh online.

54:13.250 --> 54:15.291
I didn't want to admit that
I thought my friend was being-

54:15.291 --> 54:16.667
Lame?

54:16.667 --> 54:19.375
Something like that.

54:19.375 --> 54:20.625
I read both sides of it
and I thought Leigh

54:20.625 --> 54:22.041
was making a better case.

54:22.041 --> 54:23.917
Don't tell her I said that.

54:23.917 --> 54:25.083
I won't.

54:25.083 --> 54:27.667
So why didn't you say anything
in our chats?

54:27.667 --> 54:29.250
Because I'm her friend.

54:29.250 --> 54:31.125
It's in the job description
to defend her.

54:31.125 --> 54:32.166
I get it.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.125
So what now?

54:37.125 --> 54:40.000
Because as much as I may
have liked Singlesurfer,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.709
you in person has been-

54:42.709 --> 54:45.959
Yeah, the feeling is mutual.

54:45.959 --> 54:50.625
Well, I guess that's that then.

54:50.625 --> 54:52.333
I guess so.

54:57.625 --> 54:58.959
No way. Seriously?

54:58.959 --> 55:01.625
When I was a kid I wanted to be
the governor of Ohio.

55:01.625 --> 55:02.834
Not the president?

55:02.834 --> 55:03.875
No. No, that's too scary.

55:03.875 --> 55:05.542
I mean, with the president
you have

55:05.542 --> 55:06.709
to deal with things like war.

55:06.709 --> 55:08.041
With the governor you get

55:08.041 --> 55:09.500
all the cool stuff
the president does,

55:09.500 --> 55:11.959
like the car and the body guards
and the cool code name

55:11.959 --> 55:13.458
but you don't have to worry
about whether or not

55:13.458 --> 55:14.834
Michigan's gonna attack.

55:14.834 --> 55:16.041
That's a good point.

55:16.041 --> 55:16.792
What about you?

55:16.792 --> 55:18.250
What'd you want to be
when you grew up?

55:18.250 --> 55:19.709
Oh, I did the little
girl trifecta.

55:19.709 --> 55:22.500
Princess, ballerina,
or a doggy doctor.

55:22.500 --> 55:23.250
Nice.

55:23.250 --> 55:24.208
Mmm, yes.

55:24.208 --> 55:26.333
But unfortunately I realized
I wasn't born into royalty,

55:26.333 --> 55:28.083
I have two left feet
and our dog Skipper

55:28.083 --> 55:30.667
didn't go live
on a farm upstate.

55:30.667 --> 55:31.917
Bloom was off the rules
on all of them.

55:31.917 --> 55:33.333
Understandable.

55:33.333 --> 55:35.166
Hey, can I ask you something?

55:35.166 --> 55:37.750
Yeah, of course.

55:40.709 --> 55:43.125
If our first date hadn't
crashed and burned...

55:43.125 --> 55:46.083
Ah, I see what you did there.

55:46.083 --> 55:49.041
Would you have wanted to go out
with me again?

55:49.041 --> 55:50.583
I think so.

55:51.959 --> 55:55.333
Ok. Why?

55:55.333 --> 55:58.125
Because I thought you were
a nice guy.

55:58.125 --> 56:00.208
Despite everything that happened
I couldn't stop thinking

56:00.208 --> 56:03.625
that you were nice I...

56:03.625 --> 56:06.375
I didn't get a lot of nice
with my ex-boyfriend,

56:06.375 --> 56:11.166
so nice was a nice change
of pace.

56:11.166 --> 56:12.083
Well, you know, I was relieved

56:12.083 --> 56:15.250
when I thought I'd never have
to see you again.

56:15.250 --> 56:15.875
Oh.

56:15.875 --> 56:17.333
But, I mean, listen.

56:17.333 --> 56:21.500
I was... I was disappointed,
you know?

56:21.500 --> 56:25.250
Like I was missing out
on something special.

56:25.250 --> 56:27.625
Oh.

56:27.625 --> 56:31.166
It's been a long time
since I've felt that way.

56:31.166 --> 56:32.208
You know, it's been
over an hour

56:32.208 --> 56:33.834
and nothing horrible
has happened.

56:33.834 --> 56:34.625
No, no, no.

56:34.625 --> 56:36.125
Don't, don't jinx it.

56:38.208 --> 56:40.250
Hazards everywhere.

56:44.417 --> 56:45.792
There's no way this could work.

56:45.792 --> 56:46.291
I know.

56:46.291 --> 56:47.375
Our best friends
hate each other.

56:47.375 --> 56:47.875
I know.

56:47.875 --> 56:49.250
You and I hate each other.

56:49.250 --> 56:50.750
I don't know about hate...

56:50.750 --> 56:53.083
We certainly don't
like each other.

56:53.083 --> 56:56.333
But Foodiefan
and Singlesurfer do.

56:56.333 --> 57:00.375
I mean, I think they do.

57:00.375 --> 57:03.458
They do.

57:03.458 --> 57:04.792
But that's not real life.

57:04.792 --> 57:10.417
That's bits and bytes and
data and hiding behind personas

57:10.417 --> 57:15.709
that aren't who we really are.

57:15.709 --> 57:18.000
And even if they were,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.792
we don't know if they could
have worked.

57:26.834 --> 57:28.583
So.

57:30.917 --> 57:32.750
So.

57:35.458 --> 57:37.083
I'm gonna go.

57:37.083 --> 57:38.625
Yeah, me too.

57:43.208 --> 57:45.000
For the record,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.417
I think Singlesurfer and
Foodiefan would have made it.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.041
Alison Richards.

59:04.041 --> 59:05.792
Working late as usual?

59:05.792 --> 59:07.375
Just making sure everything
is in order

59:07.375 --> 59:09.291
for when you come work
at the Richards Record.

59:09.291 --> 59:10.208
What a coincidence.

59:10.208 --> 59:11.792
I was just figuring out
where you're gonna sit

59:11.792 --> 59:13.959
when you come to work
at The Peters Post.

59:13.959 --> 59:15.750
I do enjoy our little chats.

59:15.750 --> 59:17.125
As do I.

59:17.125 --> 59:19.041
So are we really gonna
do this?

59:19.041 --> 59:20.458
Merge our two companies?

59:20.458 --> 59:22.417
I've run the numbers ten times
and I keep coming up

59:22.417 --> 59:24.000
with the same answer.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.500
We're better together
than we are apart.

59:25.500 --> 59:26.667
We always were.

59:26.667 --> 59:30.041
Are you really ready to let
this go?

59:30.041 --> 59:32.083
I've been doing this
a long time.

59:32.083 --> 59:33.750
I started this blog
before people really knew

59:33.750 --> 59:35.750
what a blog was.

59:35.750 --> 59:37.125
It's been my life.

59:37.125 --> 59:37.709
I know.

59:37.709 --> 59:40.250
I was there every day and I
saw how important it is to you.

59:40.250 --> 59:42.375
Yes, it is.

59:42.375 --> 59:43.458
But when Leigh told me

59:43.458 --> 59:46.250
that the stakes weren't
high enough for me

59:46.250 --> 59:48.709
I realized she was right.

59:48.709 --> 59:52.250
Things around here have
been routine.

59:52.250 --> 59:53.709
What, you switched
to half caf?

59:53.709 --> 59:55.291
When the thought of betting
Richards Record

59:55.291 --> 59:57.083
first popped into my mind

59:57.083 --> 01:00:00.542
my first thought
wasn't "that's ridiculous".

01:00:00.542 --> 01:00:03.875
It was "why doesn't
that sound ridiculous?"

01:00:06.667 --> 01:00:08.792
I wouldn't have made this bet
if on some level at least

01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:11.834
I wasn't prepared to lose.

01:00:11.834 --> 01:00:12.792
Ok.

01:00:12.792 --> 01:00:14.208
But I am gonna win.

01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:15.166
Ok.

01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:18.500
How are you gonna feel
when that happens?

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:19.959
Let's just say you're not
the only one looking for

01:00:19.959 --> 01:00:22.667
a little change in routine.

01:00:22.667 --> 01:00:26.500
So I guess we should
talk about logistics.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:30.333
Absolutely.

01:00:31.125 --> 01:00:31.875
It was bad.

01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:33.875
So bad.

01:00:35.417 --> 01:00:37.917
Well, here we are.

01:00:37.917 --> 01:00:39.333
Do you want me to escort
you home?

01:00:39.333 --> 01:00:42.792
Uh, my car's here, so...
I could give you a ride.

01:00:42.792 --> 01:00:44.458
Oh, no, it's good.
I drove here.

01:00:44.458 --> 01:00:47.125
I'm good.

01:00:47.125 --> 01:00:49.041
I uh, I had a great time.

01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:51.542
So did I.

01:00:51.542 --> 01:00:53.959
So the date's officially over,
right?

01:00:53.959 --> 01:00:55.500
Right.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.125
So that means...

01:00:57.125 --> 01:00:58.792
What?

01:00:58.792 --> 01:01:00.667
We're not bad dates.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.542
Yeah, buddy! That's what
I'm talking about!

01:01:04.542 --> 01:01:05.625
In your face!

01:01:05.625 --> 01:01:06.750
We crush bad dates!

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.500
We're good at dating!

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:14.000
So I... I have an idea.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:14.875
Ok.

01:01:14.875 --> 01:01:17.291
I know this date was for us,
not our blogs, but...

01:01:17.291 --> 01:01:18.709
It was a really good date.

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:21.083
It was, wasn't it?

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:23.709
And you think we should
tell people about it?

01:01:23.709 --> 01:01:25.709
Yeah.

01:01:25.709 --> 01:01:28.709
I would love for people to read
about a good date for once.

01:01:28.709 --> 01:01:29.792
Ok.

01:01:29.792 --> 01:01:30.667
Yeah, let's write it up tonight

01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:32.333
and turn it in first thing
tomorrow.

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:34.417
Great. I can't wait to read it.

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:36.375
Me too.

01:01:36.375 --> 01:01:39.792
Well, um... goodnight.

01:01:39.792 --> 01:01:41.500
Goodnight.

01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:46.500
If we write about
tonight's date,

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.834
that means it was for work.

01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:53.625
I want our first kiss to be
on a real date.

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:56.166
So we get a real date?

01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:57.834
Well, we were so good at it.

01:01:57.834 --> 01:02:00.709
It would be a waste of all
that dating talent not to.

01:02:02.542 --> 01:02:03.291
Goodnight.

01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:04.542
Goodnight.

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:20.667
Ok, you are
never gonna believe

01:02:20.667 --> 01:02:22.041
the incredible day I've had!

01:02:22.041 --> 01:02:26.333
Seriously, it's like I've lost
all my bad dating karma.

01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:28.125
Erin, what's wrong?

01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:31.000
I think I found all your bad
dating karma.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.750
Oh no. What happened?

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.542
Erin? Leigh's Erin?

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:36.333
Your mystery internet
soulmate was the woman

01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:37.959
who kinda hates you?

01:02:37.959 --> 01:02:40.166
That's the one.

01:02:40.166 --> 01:02:41.834
I'm sorry, man.

01:02:41.834 --> 01:02:43.333
Hey, what're you gonna do?

01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:44.959
I can't do anything.

01:02:44.959 --> 01:02:46.959
We'd obviously never
work out.

01:02:46.959 --> 01:02:48.750
But you said you were
hitting it off online.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:51.000
That was before I knew
who he really was.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:51.959
I just wish there was some way

01:02:51.959 --> 01:02:53.959
I could show her
who I really am.

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.834
Enough about me, though.

01:02:58.834 --> 01:03:00.250
Um, how'd things go with Leigh?

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:00.875
Incredible.

01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:02.083
We had the best time.

01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:02.667
Really?

01:03:02.667 --> 01:03:03.375
Really.

01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:05.166
It's amazing how much easier
dating someone is

01:03:05.166 --> 01:03:08.542
when you don't have crazy
people trying to mess it up.

01:03:08.542 --> 01:03:11.959
Milo Peters and Alison
Richards together?

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:13.166
I thought they hated each other.

01:03:13.166 --> 01:03:15.792
Well, apparently they have
one thing in common, greed.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.000
You know, our posts
about our horrible dates

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.208
were getting huge numbers

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:20.333
so it made sense
that they wanted more.

01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:21.959
So what're you gonna do?

01:03:21.959 --> 01:03:23.583
We are gonna give them
what they want.

01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:25.208
A third date.

01:03:30.125 --> 01:03:32.500
Ok. Where do I start?

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.834
Uh, I'm sorry?

01:03:33.834 --> 01:03:35.166
Oh, you don't have
to apologize.

01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:36.375
No, I meant you.

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:39.333
You're sorry, for intentionally
ruining our dates.

01:03:39.333 --> 01:03:41.500
Um... yes?

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.500
Alison.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.125
Your Bad Date Chronicles
have generated millions of hits

01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:47.291
as far as revenue.

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:49.250
I don't even think our
accounting department

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:51.709
has ever been asked
to count that high.

01:03:51.709 --> 01:03:53.875
So no, I won't apologize
for making something popular

01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:55.000
and successful.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.750
Even if it meant I got hurt
in the process?

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.917
How did you get hurt?

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:58.959
I was on fire.

01:03:58.959 --> 01:04:00.917
Oh, you really need to let
that go, Leigh.

01:04:00.917 --> 01:04:02.959
Everybody else has.

01:04:02.959 --> 01:04:03.834
Well, it's over now.

01:04:03.834 --> 01:04:05.041
You have your final date piece,

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.375
I have fulfilled my duties.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:07.709
I can't print this.

01:04:07.709 --> 01:04:08.667
Why not?

01:04:08.667 --> 01:04:10.291
"It's easy to get distracted
by the things

01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:12.041
"that don't really matter,

01:04:12.041 --> 01:04:14.417
"but that's what makes it all
the more exciting

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:16.417
"when you can see
past those distractions to find

01:04:16.417 --> 01:04:19.875
"the real person
standing behind them."

01:04:19.875 --> 01:04:20.959
Ugh.

01:04:20.959 --> 01:04:23.375
Erin already pitched
the love stories blog.

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:24.667
Remember?

01:04:24.667 --> 01:04:26.792
We don't do fiction.

01:04:26.792 --> 01:04:27.750
It's not fiction.

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:29.291
That was our date.

01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:30.792
You prefer that I make
something up?

01:04:30.792 --> 01:04:33.625
Say we had a horrible time
and there was like a plague

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:34.959
of locusts or something?

01:04:34.959 --> 01:04:36.625
Plague of locusts.

01:04:36.625 --> 01:04:38.750
That's a little far-fetched,

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:41.166
but I like where
you're going with this.

01:04:41.166 --> 01:04:43.000
What if the restaurant
had cockroaches?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.083
I'm not doing this.

01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:46.750
That is the date we had.

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:49.291
If you want something else,
write it yourself.

01:04:54.333 --> 01:04:57.417
Alright. I will.

01:05:15.417 --> 01:05:19.417
So Alison really tried
to sabotage your date, huh?

01:05:19.417 --> 01:05:20.542
Milo.

01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:23.583
Ok, ok. We're terrible people.

01:05:23.583 --> 01:05:25.083
But we had good reason.

01:05:25.083 --> 01:05:25.875
Oh, you did?

01:05:25.875 --> 01:05:26.709
Yes, money.

01:05:26.709 --> 01:05:27.583
Ok.

01:05:27.583 --> 01:05:31.500
What I meant is money
for the company.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.542
To pay people's salaries.

01:05:32.542 --> 01:05:33.375
Not just you and me,

01:05:33.375 --> 01:05:35.500
I'm responsible for
all these people here

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.625
and sometimes it's a little...

01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:40.750
Scary?

01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:42.125
Intimidating.

01:05:45.417 --> 01:05:47.458
And I feel the weight of
that responsibility every day,

01:05:47.458 --> 01:05:50.166
and I guess it made me
a little crazy.

01:05:50.166 --> 01:05:52.375
And I'm sorry.

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:54.667
Thank you.

01:05:54.667 --> 01:05:57.709
This is really well-written.

01:05:57.709 --> 01:06:00.000
You really like her, huh?

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.208
I do.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:04.500
Well, this isn't
what they want.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:04.667
I don't know, Milo.

01:06:04.667 --> 01:06:06.959
Doesn't everybody want a story
with a happy ending?

01:06:06.959 --> 01:06:11.125
Yeah, for themselves,
but not other people.

01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:13.417
But if this is what you want
to publish...

01:06:13.417 --> 01:06:15.250
It is.

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:17.750
Then this is what we'll publish.

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:20.458
Ok.

01:06:20.458 --> 01:06:23.125
Just let me show it
to Alison first.

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:25.166
I don't want there to be
any surprises.

01:06:25.166 --> 01:06:26.667
Ok. Milo, thank you.

01:06:26.667 --> 01:06:29.458
I appreciate it.

01:06:29.458 --> 01:06:32.500
Remember that when
we're all unemployed.

01:06:38.834 --> 01:06:40.333
This is good.

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:42.417
This is really good.

01:06:42.417 --> 01:06:46.583
This makes that fire stuff
look like child's play.

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:50.625
Bad Date Chronicles,
here we come.

01:06:50.625 --> 01:06:52.500
And publish.

01:07:05.208 --> 01:07:06.333
Aargh!

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.291
Hey. Can we talk?

01:07:16.291 --> 01:07:18.709
Milo. Yes, actually
we need to talk,

01:07:18.709 --> 01:07:21.375
but I have to run out and find
Leigh really quickly.

01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:23.208
Do you mind waiting for me?

01:07:23.208 --> 01:07:23.917
Not at all.

01:07:23.917 --> 01:07:25.583
I'll be right here.

01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:05.125
I don't understand.

01:08:05.125 --> 01:08:06.000
Conner.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.166
This is not her.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.709
Everything matches
with what you said.

01:08:09.709 --> 01:08:11.083
Instead of writing
a romantic comedy,

01:08:11.083 --> 01:08:13.166
she wrote a horror movie.

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:16.917
"When he asked me

01:08:16.917 --> 01:08:19.417
"if I thought I wanted
to go out with him again

01:08:19.417 --> 01:08:21.917
"after the first date I
almost couldn't decide

01:08:21.917 --> 01:08:26.291
"if I wanted to scream, laugh,
run away, or throw up.

01:08:26.291 --> 01:08:29.082
"That I kept myself from
doing any of these things

01:08:29.082 --> 01:08:34.041
"is nothing short of a miracle."

01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:36.959
Why would she do this?

01:08:36.959 --> 01:08:39.332
I hate to say it but I think
you got played.

01:08:42.875 --> 01:08:45.542
This way she can write her
Bad Date Chronicles,

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:48.625
you look like a fool,
she gets all the hits,

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.417
we get left with nothing.

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:58.500
I really thought she liked me,
you know?

01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.959
Sorry, man.

01:09:04.625 --> 01:09:07.125
You haven't published
my story yet, have you?

01:09:09.332 --> 01:09:11.125
Good. I think it needs
a few revisions.

01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:31.250
Yes.

01:09:36.166 --> 01:09:38.792
You have a food problem?

01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:49.625
I always lose my appetite
when I feel like I've messed up

01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:51.709
something important.

01:09:54.417 --> 01:09:56.959
Maybe you didn't mess it up.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:10:01.250
Maybe someone else
messed it up.

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:04.208
Maybe we both did?

01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:06.041
But I presume
you heard about

01:10:06.041 --> 01:10:07.834
Leigh and Conner's date
last night?

01:10:07.834 --> 01:10:09.083
Yes, it went great!

01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:12.208
So I figured, you know, if they
could let bygones be bygones

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:16.125
and start over, then
maybe we could, too.

01:10:27.542 --> 01:10:29.625
"What time can you
pick me up tonight?"

01:10:36.625 --> 01:10:38.959
It wasn't me.

01:10:38.959 --> 01:10:40.792
Oh, it's a news alert.

01:10:40.792 --> 01:10:42.792
Conner just posted the write-up
of their date.

01:10:46.583 --> 01:10:47.875
Uh oh.

01:10:47.875 --> 01:10:50.083
"It turns out that our bad
dates really were my fault

01:10:50.083 --> 01:10:51.750
"because I'm the one who was
willing to give her

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:53.375
"the benefit of the doubt.

01:10:53.375 --> 01:10:56.333
"I was willing to believe that
she was a decent human being."

01:10:56.333 --> 01:10:57.208
Did you know about this?

01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:57.875
No!

01:10:57.875 --> 01:10:58.667
When I talked to him,
it was fine.

01:10:58.667 --> 01:11:00.458
They had a great time,
everything was great.

01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:01.542
Or maybe he was
just pretending that

01:11:01.542 --> 01:11:03.375
so he could write
this hit piece.

01:11:03.375 --> 01:11:05.625
No, Conner is not like that.

01:11:05.625 --> 01:11:06.875
And what about you?

01:11:06.875 --> 01:11:08.417
Coming over here all...

01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:09.750
charming.

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:10.750
I'm such an idiot.

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:11.917
Where are you going?

01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:13.458
I have to find Leigh.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.959
It's funny.

01:11:45.959 --> 01:11:48.125
What is?

01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:52.250
How fast it all comes back.

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:54.458
I really didn't think I had
gotten over my break-up

01:11:54.458 --> 01:11:56.208
with Danny.

01:11:56.208 --> 01:11:58.208
You said his name.

01:11:58.208 --> 01:12:00.583
That's the thing.

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:03.625
I thought it would hurt too much
to say his name.

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:07.583
I thought I was still too hurt
by everything that had happened.

01:12:07.583 --> 01:12:09.542
It's understandable.

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:11.291
But see? I wasn't.

01:12:11.291 --> 01:12:12.834
I was better.

01:12:12.834 --> 01:12:14.500
I felt better.

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:18.667
About myself, about my life,
about everything.

01:12:22.834 --> 01:12:29.333
I just didn't realize it
until I read this.

01:12:29.333 --> 01:12:32.166
Now I know how much better
I was

01:12:32.166 --> 01:12:37.625
because now I remember
what it feels like to be hurt.

01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:42.083
It comes back so fast.

01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:45.125
It's funny, isn't it?

01:13:02.417 --> 01:13:03.750
You were just waiting
for an opportunity

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:05.458
to stab me in the back,
weren't you?

01:13:05.458 --> 01:13:08.250
Hold on a second.

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.542
Somehow you're
the victim here?

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.041
You know, I really gotta
give you credit for that.

01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:15.458
I was prepared to lose stuff.

01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:17.375
That was a fantastic
performance.

01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:20.375
Have a seat, please.

01:13:20.375 --> 01:13:21.583
Let me guess.

01:13:21.583 --> 01:13:23.959
Conner character assassination
piece?

01:13:23.959 --> 01:13:25.166
All your idea, right?

01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:27.750
Just like Leigh's hatchet job
was yours?

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.083
What are you talking about?

01:13:29.083 --> 01:13:30.333
We haven't posted anything.

01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:34.041
Yeah, but I saw what
you were gonna post.

01:13:34.041 --> 01:13:35.625
No!

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:37.583
Leigh didn't write this,
I did.

01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:38.542
What?

01:13:38.542 --> 01:13:44.417
Leigh wrote this really lovely,
sweet piece of fluff.

01:13:44.417 --> 01:13:45.875
I couldn't let her post it.

01:13:45.875 --> 01:13:48.417
So I wrote this and I was gonna
put it up instead.

01:13:48.417 --> 01:13:51.375
But I changed my mind.

01:13:51.375 --> 01:13:54.125
I don't believe you.

01:13:54.125 --> 01:13:56.041
Where'd you find these papers,
Milo?

01:13:56.041 --> 01:13:57.959
In the- in the trash.

01:13:57.959 --> 01:13:59.083
Because that's where
I put them!

01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:00.709
I threw it away!

01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:04.333
I wasn't gonna post that.

01:14:04.333 --> 01:14:06.166
And Conner's original piece
was about

01:14:06.166 --> 01:14:08.000
how amazing their date was.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.542
And then I showed him this.

01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:11.709
Of course you did.

01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:13.208
We're terrible people.

01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:14.792
The absolute worst.

01:14:14.792 --> 01:14:16.000
I mean, they could
have been in love.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.458
Or at least headed that way.

01:14:17.458 --> 01:14:18.583
And we ruined it.

01:14:18.583 --> 01:14:20.625
Terrible, horrible people.

01:14:20.625 --> 01:14:21.917
The worst.

01:14:26.417 --> 01:14:28.000
Brad, get in here ASAP.

01:14:34.041 --> 01:14:34.917
Yo.

01:14:34.917 --> 01:14:39.917
Brad, we need your help.

01:14:39.917 --> 01:14:42.041
What did you two do?

01:14:59.375 --> 01:15:00.959
Erin?

01:15:00.959 --> 01:15:02.583
Brad.

01:15:02.583 --> 01:15:04.375
Get out!

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.333
And you!

01:15:06.333 --> 01:15:07.959
Get out!

01:15:07.959 --> 01:15:11.125
And you.

01:15:11.125 --> 01:15:12.792
Well, you own the place so I
can't really tell you to get out

01:15:12.792 --> 01:15:17.125
but I'm not very happy
with you, either.

01:15:17.125 --> 01:15:18.417
That's fair.

01:15:18.417 --> 01:15:21.500
Erin... just take a look
at these.

01:15:30.542 --> 01:15:32.000
What did you do?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.917
It was them.

01:15:33.917 --> 01:15:34.750
It's true.

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:37.125
It's our fault.

01:15:37.125 --> 01:15:40.166
But we just wanna know how
to fix it.

01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:42.417
So what do we say?

01:15:42.417 --> 01:15:44.125
How do we fix this?

01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:11.750
Erin, I got your message.

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:13.083
What...

01:16:31.041 --> 01:16:32.625
I still don't understand
what we're doing here.

01:16:32.625 --> 01:16:35.125
Just trust me, ok?

01:16:35.125 --> 01:16:36.458
Ok.

01:16:38.166 --> 01:16:39.166
Wow.

01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:40.583
Amigo.

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:13.166
"My date with Conner
was unexpected.

01:17:13.166 --> 01:17:15.792
"Not because it turns out
that he's charming and funny.

01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:16.625
"I had gotten glimpses

01:17:16.625 --> 01:17:20.041
"of those qualities on
our previous dates."

01:17:20.041 --> 01:17:21.417
"No, the date with Conner
was unexpected

01:17:21.417 --> 01:17:24.208
"because I realized that
our horrible dates were really

01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:27.667
"our own faults.

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:29.333
"Our scars from past
relationships meant that

01:17:29.333 --> 01:17:33.875
"we weren't willing to give each
other the benefit of the doubt."

01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:35.750
"Leigh's willingness
to throw caution to the wind

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:37.959
"and go out on a
spur-of-the-moment date

01:17:37.959 --> 01:17:43.291
"made me look at her
in a whole new light."

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:45.583
"She not only accepted
this folly,

01:17:45.583 --> 01:17:48.709
"she also embraced the chance
to jump off a very tall bridge

01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:50.875
"with only a very thin
bungee cord

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:54.291
"and I admire her bravery."

01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:57.125
"Here's the thing about doubt.

01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:59.333
"It's just a distraction.

01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:00.750
"It's easy to get distracted
by the things

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:01.834
"that don't really matter

01:18:01.834 --> 01:18:04.583
"but that's what makes it
all the more exciting

01:18:04.583 --> 01:18:06.041
"when you can see past those
distractions to find

01:18:06.041 --> 01:18:08.709
"the real person
standing behind them.

01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:13.333
"I saw Conner for the first
time last night,

01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:17.125
"and I hope it's not the last."

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:20.166
"Hands clammy, mouths dry,
hearts pounding.

01:18:20.166 --> 01:18:22.500
"Leigh and I stood together
on the precipice,

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:26.667
"risking a fall but eagerly
anticipating the act of falling.

01:18:26.667 --> 01:18:28.542
"And together we leapt."

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.750
You wrote this?

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:35.917
You?

01:18:35.917 --> 01:18:40.250
Mmmhmm.

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:41.834
Can I ask you a question?

01:18:41.834 --> 01:18:44.417
Ok.

01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:48.250
Can we count this as
our first real date?

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:50.625
Sure.

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:55.166
Then why aren't you giving me
that goodnight kiss?

01:18:55.166 --> 01:18:57.250
Because I'm not ready
to say goodnight.

01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:04.875
Bradley, stop it.

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.792
Yeah, dude!

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.333
Ok, ok.

01:19:41.125 --> 01:19:42.458
Hey!

01:19:42.458 --> 01:19:44.417
Woo!

01:19:44.417 --> 01:19:45.166
A toast!

01:19:45.166 --> 01:19:46.709
Somebody has to make
a toast.

01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:49.250
I think Conner should go first.

01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:50.417
Ok.

01:19:50.417 --> 01:19:51.709
Alright.

01:19:53.333 --> 01:19:54.125
Well.

01:19:54.125 --> 01:19:54.834
Thank you.

01:19:54.834 --> 01:19:56.166
You're welcome.

01:19:56.166 --> 01:20:01.875
To new beginnings, old friends,
and that's all I've got.

01:20:03.125 --> 01:20:04.709
Wait, wait. I have one.

01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:06.917
To the end of The Bad Date
Chronicles and the beginning

01:20:06.917 --> 01:20:10.750
of the real love stories column,
non-fiction.

01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:12.291
I have to hand it to you guys,
I didn't think anyone

01:20:12.291 --> 01:20:14.792
would want to read
about that last date.

01:20:14.792 --> 01:20:19.041
And who knew it would have
been our most popular post?

01:20:19.041 --> 01:20:20.166
But enough of that
romantic stuff.

01:20:20.166 --> 01:20:23.083
The real reason we're here
to celebrate.

01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:26.250
A union between the Richards
Record and Peters Post.

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:27.750
A partnership.

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:29.834
To the Richards Peters Report.

01:20:31.291 --> 01:20:32.625
Wait a second.

01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:34.083
Why does your name go first?

01:20:36.417 --> 01:20:37.458
We talked about this.

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:40.166
Because my site has been
around a lot longer than yours.

01:20:40.166 --> 01:20:41.667
Yeah, but I have a more
engaged audience.

01:20:41.667 --> 01:20:42.458
Engaged?

01:20:42.458 --> 01:20:44.375
Wait, my audience
is very engaged.

01:20:44.375 --> 01:20:46.625
How long until they realize
they're in love with each other?

01:20:46.625 --> 01:20:49.500
I think we should set them up
on a few bad dates.

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:50.375
...so then my name
goes first-

01:20:50.375 --> 01:20:53.125
Which is why we're here having
this partnership.

01:20:53.125 --> 01:20:54.458
Why a bad date?

01:20:54.458 --> 01:20:55.959
Because sometimes you need
a few bad dates

01:20:55.959 --> 01:20:58.375
to know which ones
you really like.

01:20:58.375 --> 01:21:00.417
...having this partnership.

01:21:04.041 --> 01:21:04.792
Cheers.
