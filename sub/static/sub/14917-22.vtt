WEBVTT

00:00.220 --> 00:02.060
This is the, uh, the sun room...

00:02.060 --> 00:06.760
which looks out on a garden that the current
owner has probably spent years cultivating,

00:06.760 --> 00:10.220
which I'll probably kill inside of a month.

00:10.220 --> 00:14.120
Well, that's impressive, 'cause it would
probably take me about two weeks.

00:14.120 --> 00:17.020
Okay, so, um, what's... what's, uh, that one?

00:17.020 --> 00:19.800
That is our blank room.

00:19.800 --> 00:20.760
A what?

00:20.760 --> 00:25.500
A blankroom... you know, the room with no
furniture where Ben and I launch rocket ships,

00:25.500 --> 00:29.560
because every 6 year old knows that
you cannot explore space with clutter.

00:29.560 --> 00:30.900
Of course. Of course.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.710
It makes perfect sense.

00:33.710 --> 00:35.480
Sorry.

00:36.190 --> 00:38.420
Hello, Sarah. How are you?

00:38.420 --> 00:40.300
I'm fine.

00:40.300 --> 00:41.580
Have you heard from Julia?

00:41.580 --> 00:43.160
No, I haven't. Why?

00:43.160 --> 00:46.450
Well, mom's all worried. Are you with someone?

00:46.450 --> 00:48.450
I'm at the park.

00:48.450 --> 00:51.470
You're with hot park guy.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.470
I probably will be about another half an hour.

00:54.470 --> 00:57.750
You're doing that flirty tilt-your-head thing. I can hear it.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.330
Okay. Great.

00:59.330 --> 01:02.330
I will call you later. Bye.

01:05.349 --> 01:07.190
Sorry.

01:07.860 --> 01:12.510
Okay, so California bungalow... you have a... a garden, you have a sun room,

01:12.510 --> 01:15.260
you have a room that you can get to the moon from.

01:15.260 --> 01:17.410
I d... I don't get it. What's the problem? What am I missing?

01:17.410 --> 01:20.360
Uh, nothing, nothing. I'm just not sure that it's the one, you know?

01:20.360 --> 01:24.220
Like when you're dating, and... and
you're dating all these people who are...

01:24.220 --> 01:31.580
what, they're kind and they're smart and they're
attractive, and, uh, they're just not the one, you know?

01:34.930 --> 01:38.310
Boy, the friends and family plan was definitely made for you.
I know.Sorry.

01:38.310 --> 01:40.350
Hi, mom. No, I haven't heard from Julia.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.850
It's not like I'm panicking.

01:41.850 --> 01:43.380
I just want to make sure she's okay.

01:43.380 --> 01:45.670
Have you called her?
Of course I've called her.

01:45.670 --> 01:50.540
Not obsessively, but today is my standing playdate
with Elizabeth, and they're not here.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.820
I'm sure that she just forgot. Tommy's gone.

01:52.820 --> 01:54.800
She's... she's got a lot on her plate.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.640
But it's just not like Julia. She always calls me back.

01:57.640 --> 02:00.650
I don't want to force myself on her, but do
you think maybe I should just stop by?

02:00.650 --> 02:02.970
Well, how is that not forcing yourself on her?

02:02.970 --> 02:05.810
Well, I'm not... you know, I have a little gift for Elizabeth...

02:05.810 --> 02:08.449
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben!

02:09.960 --> 02:11.840
Oh, there goes your house.
What?

02:11.840 --> 02:14.940
Uh,n othing. Nothing, mom. I think you should go and see Julia.

02:14.940 --> 02:16.930
Go right over to her house.

02:16.930 --> 02:19.600
Great idea, Kitty. Thanks.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.860
So, uh...

02:20.860 --> 02:23.500
this is what my house looks like, uh, when a hurricane hits it.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.680
That settles it.

02:24.680 --> 02:28.000
I'm just gonna have to go over and see it in person.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.480
Really?

02:29.480 --> 02:31.120
There's an open house this afternoon.

02:31.120 --> 02:34.140
Oh, oh, we could go pretend to be crazy
neighbors and scare off any backup offers.

02:34.140 --> 02:37.410
Right, right, and Evan will be awake. Screaming infant... that ought to do it.

02:37.410 --> 02:40.630
Oh, oh, this is too perfect. All right, I'm gonna go get Ben's stuff.

02:44.660 --> 02:46.700
Hi, honey. I'm still at the park.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.820
Well, let me come keep you company. My conference call finished early,

02:49.820 --> 02:52.640
and I hear that the 3-month-and-under set can be a little dull.

02:52.640 --> 02:58.960
Well, you... you know, I've actually been talking to
a friend trying to buy this house, and I'm... I'm fine.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.290
You, uh, you don't have to worry about me.

03:01.290 --> 03:06.250
Well, I know you're fine. I just thought
we could spend some time together.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.470
It's just, you know, I have a lot
of errands I have to run today.

03:08.470 --> 03:10.790
The errands can wait. I mean, I'm going back to work soon.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.740
We should take advantage of this time while we have it.

03:12.740 --> 03:17.960
Uh, you're right. But y... you know, I'm always at the park, so, um,

03:19.060 --> 03:21.480
let... let... let's do something different.

03:21.480 --> 03:24.360
How about the pier? We could use a day by the water.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.780
Pier sounds great. I'll pick you up.

03:25.780 --> 03:29.290
Oh, and listen, tell your friend, we all have
to do our part to stimulate this economy.

03:29.290 --> 03:31.550
She should definitely buy that house.

03:31.550 --> 03:34.340
Right, right. Will...

03:35.110 --> 03:37.080
will do.

03:38.630 --> 03:40.540
Change of plans.
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

03:40.540 --> 03:43.060
I... I have this appointment that I completely forgot about.

03:43.060 --> 03:46.890
It's okay. I can always, you know, flip a coin.

03:47.480 --> 03:50.010
I... I could, um...

03:50.010 --> 03:52.010
go tomorrow.

03:52.010 --> 03:54.260
All right. Well, Ben will be in school,

03:54.260 --> 03:57.070
but, you know, you and I could go and look at the house.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.640
Maybe we could have some lunch afterwards.
There's this noodle place around the corner...

03:59.640 --> 04:03.200
the one I was telling you about.
Oh, I love noodles.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.020
It's a date.

04:05.020 --> 04:06.680
It's not a date. It's just, you know...
It's a plan.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.450
Thank you. Yes, a plan.

04:12.150 --> 04:14.200
I'll see you tomorrow.

04:15.080 --> 04:18.060
I am so sorry to keep you waiting. I was up
till midnight working on these mock-ups,

04:18.060 --> 04:20.250
and now I can't find them.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.589
Job hunting?

04:21.589 --> 04:22.850
Is it something I said?

04:22.850 --> 04:24.960
Oh, that's not mine.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.920
Actually, that's me. How you doing, Holly?

04:26.920 --> 04:29.170
Nice to see you again.
You, too.

04:29.170 --> 04:30.550
This your résumé?

04:30.550 --> 04:32.580
It is, not that it's doing much good.

04:32.580 --> 04:35.410
You have to be a rhodes scholar to deliver pizzas these days.

04:35.410 --> 04:38.890
Well, why don't you give Ojai a try?

04:38.890 --> 04:43.680
Um, I'm just not sure that I want
to be around there. No offense.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.330
Only a little taken.

04:45.330 --> 04:47.820
Yeah, but I didn't want to work
there, really, at the beginning,either,

04:47.820 --> 04:50.760
and seriously, you don't have to be
around the Walkers if you don't want to be.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.460
Is that the issue, the Walkers?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.930
I think Rebecca just wants me off her couch.

04:54.930 --> 04:57.440
May I? I mean,you never know. I might find something.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.240
You should consider it.
Look, I'm sure that it's a fantastic place,

05:00.240 --> 05:03.480
and I'm glad that you guys got over
whatever issues you had with the Walkers.

05:03.480 --> 05:09.900
But I'm just having a hard time wrapping my head around going to
work at the same place that son of a bitch went every day.

05:11.850 --> 05:12.920
Sorry.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.110
No, please.

05:14.110 --> 05:18.870
I've said a lot worse about William, many times.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.220
Well, I'm gonna go on this jog before it gets too hot.

05:22.220 --> 05:24.900
Okay. Have a good day.

05:26.750 --> 05:30.450
I didn't realize he felt so strongly about the Walkers.

05:30.450 --> 05:32.940
You have no idea.

05:35.940 --> 05:38.730
Mom, I'm not having this conversation till you put your ear bud in.

05:38.730 --> 05:39.980
Come on. You're gonna get a ticket.

05:39.980 --> 05:42.350
Oh, for goodness sakes!

05:42.350 --> 05:47.230
I'm telling you, I'm a bigger menace trying
to put this thing in while I'm driving

05:47.230 --> 05:51.980
than I would be if I just did it without
it, and besides that,I'm already here.

05:51.980 --> 05:53.120
Good.

05:53.120 --> 05:57.550
Um, will you tell Julia that I've actually
bought Elizabeth an adorable little toy pony?

05:57.550 --> 06:01.240
It actually neighs, moves its head and
is steady enough for her to sit on.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.010
What are you doing?

06:04.180 --> 06:10.030
I'm carrying in the adorable little toy pony I got Elizabeth.

06:10.030 --> 06:11.970
That is so unfair.

06:11.970 --> 06:14.770
W... where did you get yours? I had
to go to, like, three stores to find mine.

06:14.770 --> 06:17.580
Oh, honey. Don't feel bad.

06:17.580 --> 06:20.630
You can't compete against the world's greatest grandma.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.220
And I have a coffee mug that proves it.

06:23.220 --> 06:25.840
You know what? I'm gonna buy her a real pony.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.360
Oh, no.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.880
What's the matter? Did you break your pony?

06:29.880 --> 06:31.580
Oh, my God.

06:37.970 --> 06:39.580
I was just as shocked as you are.

06:39.580 --> 06:44.270
I had no idea Tommy had taken on a second
mortgage or missed any of the house payments.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.770
He was funneling everything into the Crawford Orchards deal.

06:46.770 --> 06:51.940
Tommy handled all the bills, and after he left,
I didn't even look at the mail for weeks.

06:51.940 --> 06:56.030
I can't believe I'm one of those wives you read
about who doesn't know how to handle their finances

06:56.030 --> 06:58.940
or what their husbands are up to until it's too late.

06:58.940 --> 07:01.580
Well, speaking as one of those wives, it's never too late.

07:01.580 --> 07:06.160
I mean, I was in my 60s when I finally learned
how to manage my own finances and got a job.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.840
You're a volunteer, mom.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.850
That's not the point. The point is, it's never too late.

07:10.850 --> 07:14.040
You have to live by your own lights, plow your own field...

07:14.040 --> 07:17.240
Yeah, pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.390
Is that being helpful?

07:18.390 --> 07:22.560
Look, I'm gonna try and sort out this mortgage
mess, but if you are gonna plowour own field,

07:22.560 --> 07:27.420
I suggest you do it soon, 'cause I won't make
any headway with the bank unless you have a job.

07:27.420 --> 07:28.740
I've tried.

07:28.740 --> 07:34.130
I applied at the public schools, the private schools,
the charter schools... nobody's hiring teachers.

07:34.130 --> 07:35.590
I even looked out of state.

07:35.590 --> 07:37.240
I called people I went to college with.

07:37.240 --> 07:38.810
I... I have an idea.

07:38.810 --> 07:41.980
We've been talking about hiring a tutor for the kids at the center.

07:41.980 --> 07:43.540
I'll talk to Maggie about you.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.090
Nora, you don't have to do that.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.450
I'll just set up an interview. That's all.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.140
Thank you.

07:51.410 --> 07:53.140
What is this stuff, by the way?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.340
I moved all of Tommy's stuff out of the bedroom closet.

07:55.340 --> 07:57.070
I couldn't stand to look at it anymore.

07:57.070 --> 07:59.630
I'm surprised you didn't burn it.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.420
I'm going to call Justin.

08:01.420 --> 08:05.860
I'm gonna tell him to come over here,
get all this stuff and get it out of your way.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.990
It's my mom. I'll call her back.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.650
They must be worried sick.

08:12.650 --> 08:18.090
Yeah, but my parents' solution to everything is to have me
move back to Phoenix and live with them, which I'm not gonna do.

08:18.090 --> 08:22.110
You know, just... assure them that
we're taking good care of you.

08:22.110 --> 08:25.340
And they need not worry. I'm gonna call Justin right now...

08:27.280 --> 08:29.910
I'm sorry to inflict all my problems on you.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.100
Come on. You're like a sister to me.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.409
And Elizabeth, she's like a...

08:34.409 --> 08:36.799
niece to me.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.429
I'm just sorry Tommy let you down so badly.

08:39.429 --> 08:41.150
Everything's gonna look much better tomorrow.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.299
I promise.

08:43.299 --> 08:46.760
Thank you.
No problem.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.860
Bye.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.540
You're having an affair.

08:54.540 --> 08:57.070
Okay, okay, an emotional affair at best.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.780
I mean, and please don't say it. I know that it's worse.

08:59.780 --> 09:01.920
It can be.

09:02.430 --> 09:05.260
You know, I just thought it was a park
crush. I wasn't too concerned, but...

09:05.260 --> 09:07.370
well,alec is just someone that I can talk to.

09:07.370 --> 09:11.860
He's... he's... he's warm and he's present
and he's not trying to run the free world.

09:11.860 --> 09:13.640
You realize this is your pattern, Kitty.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.450
Oh, God, Sarah. No, come on. Please
do not talk about my patterns.

09:17.450 --> 09:21.280
every time somebody's disappointed you,
you're off looking for the next shiny thing.

09:21.280 --> 09:25.560
You lied to Robert, and if you don't feel guilty...
Well, no, I do.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.720
I do feel guilty. I feel guilty because I am guilty.

09:28.720 --> 09:32.260
I'm married. I have a new baby.

09:32.260 --> 09:37.010
I mean, believe me, I'm trying to convince
myself that Alec is wrong and that... that...

09:37.010 --> 09:41.220
he's just some stupid fantasy, but then
every time I see him, my... my heart races,

09:41.220 --> 09:47.840
and I feel... I feel pretty and I feel funny, and I feel...

09:48.280 --> 09:50.780
connected.

09:51.090 --> 09:56.350
I've been there, but I have to tell you, that
feeling is the beginning of the end of your marriage.

09:56.350 --> 09:59.040
What if my marriage is a mistake?

09:59.040 --> 10:02.010
What if Robert is never gonna be
the husband that I need him to be

10:02.010 --> 10:05.220
let alone a good father for Evan?

10:05.220 --> 10:07.960
I mean, y... you and Joe got a divorce...

10:07.960 --> 10:12.000
Yes, we did, which is why I know how horrific it is.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.300
Okay, so what are you saying, Sarah?

10:13.300 --> 10:15.720
I'm supposed to go home and I'm supposed to
pretend that I don't have any of these feelings?

10:15.720 --> 10:17.540
No, I'm not saying you have to pretend.
Because I don't think that I can do that.

10:17.540 --> 10:22.490
I'm not trying to deny your feelings.
I'm saying stay away from the park.

10:22.490 --> 10:24.300
No buts.

10:24.300 --> 10:28.270
Stop going to the damn park.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.070
Right, so when Oxford-Stanton financial went out of business,

10:34.070 --> 10:37.750
they sold the loan to the pioneer highland trust company,

10:37.750 --> 10:40.310
who in turn sold the loan to you, am I right?

10:40.310 --> 10:42.170
I would say I have a very strong case to say

10:42.170 --> 10:46.330
my client couldn't find you people to make her house payments.

10:46.330 --> 10:48.460
No, of course I'm not being funny. I'm being deadly serious.

10:48.460 --> 10:51.810
These are human beings who are having trouble...

10:52.530 --> 10:55.630
And that's it? That's the only way you'll stop the foreclosure?

10:55.630 --> 10:57.880
Okay, fine. Just give me the exact amount.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.080
Right. I'll deliver it today.

11:02.950 --> 11:05.270
You're writing a check?

11:06.390 --> 11:07.360
Yeah.

11:07.360 --> 11:10.040
It's... it's the only way. I've tried everything else.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.280
How much?

11:14.550 --> 11:16.910
$16,400?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.480
Jeez, Kevin.
What? It's a loan.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.340
We'll get paid back.
By whom... Tommy?

11:21.340 --> 11:24.280
I'm sorry, Kevin, but I've worked hard
so we can set aside some savings,

11:24.280 --> 11:26.920
not so I can become another victim in your brother's midlife crisis.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.840
What am I supposed to do, watch Julia and Elizabeth get evicted?

11:29.840 --> 11:30.960
They might have to go back to Phoenix.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.120
Is that what this is about, your desperate need to hold on to Elizabeth?

11:34.120 --> 11:35.850
No, it's about helping my brother's family.

11:35.850 --> 11:40.020
You know what? I'll take it out of my 41k. It won't cost you a cent.

11:41.690 --> 11:44.690
We gotta batten down the hatches, get through the next 12 months,

11:44.690 --> 11:46.190
but I think we're gonna do it.

11:46.190 --> 11:48.710
Thanks for your support, and I'm gonna
take you up on some of those ideas.

11:48.710 --> 11:52.020
Monique, Alan, thanks again. Thanks for your support.

11:55.830 --> 11:57.080
Well, that went well, I thought.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.150
What the hell was that?

12:00.150 --> 12:03.240
What?
Pulling out of the trade association?

12:04.300 --> 12:05.890
I thought that was a good idea.

12:05.890 --> 12:10.280
We gotta cut costs, Holly, and let's face it, they're only
interested in looking after the big boys in Chile and...

12:10.280 --> 12:13.750
this is not about the trade association.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.290
We were going to discuss it.

12:16.290 --> 12:17.990
I thought we just did, in the boardroom.

12:17.990 --> 12:24.320
No, I mean you and me, and then we were going to
bring it to the board with our recommendation.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.110
Holly, I didn't bring it up.

12:26.110 --> 12:29.050
But once it was on the table, what did you expect me to do?

12:29.050 --> 12:30.570
I weighed in, as did you.

12:30.570 --> 12:33.460
And they just so happened to side with you?

12:33.460 --> 12:34.430
What's your point?

12:34.430 --> 12:39.310
That you have to recognize that this is not an even playing field.

12:39.310 --> 12:42.780
You are a Walker.

12:42.780 --> 12:46.790
Do you want me to apologize for my name or change it?

12:48.210 --> 12:53.630
Sarah, ever since you got back, I
have been trying to work with you.

12:53.630 --> 12:59.300
But every time we have a disagreement,
suddenly I'm up against you and the board,

12:59.300 --> 13:04.600
because they will always defer to you, and you know it.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.120
It's a family business, Holly.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.890
I don't know what else to tell you.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:30.720 --> 13:34.460
Okay, your sand drawing did not do this justice.

13:34.460 --> 13:35.760
You don't think it's too Martha Stewart?

13:35.760 --> 13:38.560
Well, that... that's what makes it so perfect.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.770
Oh, my God.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.550
You have a porch swing.

13:42.550 --> 13:45.890
Oh, you have no idea how much I love porch swings.

13:45.890 --> 13:50.140
I have always wanted a house with a porch swing.

13:51.610 --> 13:57.200
I mean, think about it... life gets too complicated,
I just come out here, I sit on this swing,

13:57.200 --> 14:03.520
I sip some lemonade, and... and all
my problems, they just melt away.

14:03.730 --> 14:07.120
You know, I'm thinking I should just forget
the house and go with the porch swing.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.670
Oh, Alec.

14:08.670 --> 14:09.850
I didn't realize you were here.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.030
We were just, uh, admiring the swing.

14:12.030 --> 14:13.970
Yeah, yeah, it's great. It swings.

14:13.970 --> 14:15.210
Everybody loves that.

14:15.210 --> 14:17.240
Hi, Leanne Madison.
Kitty Walker.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.730
It's always good to get a woman's opinion.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.490
So let me show you the counteroffer.

14:22.490 --> 14:25.910
They gave in on all the upgrades,
so if you're ready to sign, it's yours.

14:25.910 --> 14:28.830
Well, what about the plumbing? Did you tell
them about the water stain on the ceiling?

14:28.830 --> 14:29.890
They're gonna take care of that.

14:29.890 --> 14:31.940
Excellent.

14:33.930 --> 14:35.390
So, uh...

14:35.390 --> 14:37.390
what do you think?

14:38.830 --> 14:41.770
But... yeah, but picture it strewn with...

14:41.770 --> 14:45.500
toys and... and dirty socks.

14:46.360 --> 14:49.330
No, it... it's, um...

14:49.330 --> 14:52.480
it's perfect.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.270
It's perfect.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.810
I completely understand your disdain for the Walkers.

15:04.810 --> 15:05.940
I figured you would.

15:05.940 --> 15:08.890
Yeah, I was very angry. I had a lot of resentment.

15:08.890 --> 15:12.190
I know exactly what you're talking about.

15:12.970 --> 15:16.680
You know, your father did write it
into the bylaws that any of his children

15:16.680 --> 15:20.210
who worked for Ojai would qualify for shares in the company.

15:20.210 --> 15:25.820
So if you worked here, you would actually
have voting rights with the board.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.900
What does that mean?

15:28.900 --> 15:33.350
Well, it means that this would be more than just a job.

15:33.350 --> 15:38.250
I think that there is a lot that you could accomplish here.

15:39.540 --> 15:44.020
Of course, you'd have to have Sarah
sign off on it, but from what I can tell,

15:44.020 --> 15:47.660
she's a big fan of yours.

15:48.830 --> 15:54.160
Yeah, maybe Rebecca was right. It
probably wouldn't hurt to give it a try.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.100
Right, so how does this work? I mean, should I talk to Sarah,

15:56.100 --> 15:57.880
or is that something you want to do?

15:57.880 --> 16:00.320
It'd be better coming from you.

16:00.320 --> 16:03.170
You're family.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.030
Right.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.730
Put the big one on there.

16:10.730 --> 16:12.460
I have to say...

16:12.460 --> 16:15.080
I haven't seen you this happy in quite a while.

16:15.080 --> 16:20.100
Well, as awful as everything is, it's kind of
thrilling to be Elizabeth's full-time day care.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.270
I've seen the budget at the center, Nora.

16:22.270 --> 16:24.440
There's not enough room for another salary.

16:24.440 --> 16:27.760
Well, all right. I'm going to subsidize
her wages, just for a little while.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.580
I'm telling you, be careful, Nora.

16:30.580 --> 16:32.470
Listen...

16:32.470 --> 16:35.660
when Tommy calls, I want to be able to say everything's all right.

16:35.660 --> 16:40.800
We took care of his house and his family,
and he has a home to come back to.

16:41.550 --> 16:44.140
Hi, everyone.

16:45.490 --> 16:49.540
Look what uncle Kevin brought you.

16:49.540 --> 16:54.560
Now we have a pony for grandma's house and for home.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.200
Guess what.

16:56.200 --> 16:59.310
This one's brand-new.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.940
You want to give him an apple?

17:00.940 --> 17:02.290
You want to give him an apple?

17:02.290 --> 17:03.890
What'd you do,lose the receipt?

17:03.890 --> 17:06.880
You can never have enough ponies.
Isn't that right, sweetheart?

17:06.880 --> 17:10.780
You know what? When I was your
age, I didn't even have one pony.

17:10.780 --> 17:14.220
Am I allowed to say she's the most
exquisite child ever to walk this earth?

17:14.220 --> 17:16.640
Go ahead. Nora's been saying it all day.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.900
Got a gift for you, too.
What?

17:25.270 --> 17:28.040
You want to take the foreclosure sign down?

17:28.040 --> 17:30.240
Oh, Kevin. Thank you.

17:30.240 --> 17:33.370
No problem.
Thank you.

17:33.590 --> 17:36.490
Okay, we... we have to sort this out.

17:37.530 --> 17:39.500
Sorry about that.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.600
Oh, no. That's okay.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.370
You sure you want to work here?

17:43.370 --> 17:46.500
Well, I... I was, but now you said it like that.

17:46.870 --> 17:50.710
Ryan, as William's son, you belong here as much as any of us.

17:50.710 --> 17:54.030
Oh, well, I don't... I don't know about that,
but I am willing to start at the ground level.

17:54.030 --> 17:57.330
I mean, I'm not expecting any favors or...
It's not a favor.

17:57.330 --> 17:59.890
This is a family business.

18:00.850 --> 18:03.500
Oh, you know what? This could be a problem.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.820
What?
As a family member working here,

18:06.820 --> 18:09.140
you would be entitled to shares.

18:09.140 --> 18:12.340
Wow, really?
And a vote on the board.

18:12.340 --> 18:14.340
Holly's feeling a little...

18:14.340 --> 18:17.480
Walker-phobic at the moment.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.930
Look, I... I don't want to step on anybody's toes.

18:20.930 --> 18:24.430
Let me talk to her, see if I can get her to relax a little bit.

18:24.430 --> 18:26.230
Maybe get her back on her meds.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.270
What's the worse she can do? Say no, right?

18:29.270 --> 18:32.720
Well, I'll keep my fingers crossed.

18:32.720 --> 18:37.940
I am all for intergalactic, um, exploration,
but I do think that that sun room is

18:37.940 --> 18:40.110
just too beautiful to be used as a blank room.

18:40.110 --> 18:42.160
Okay, the kitchen is now officially the blank room.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.930
We only eat takeout anyways, so...

18:43.930 --> 18:46.040
God, I cannot believe that I just bought a house.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.720
Come on. Buyer's remorse already?

18:47.720 --> 18:48.900
No, no, that's just it.

18:48.900 --> 18:52.970
I mean, I signed on the dotted line,
and I am not regretting a thing...

18:52.970 --> 18:54.670
Thanks to you.
It was you. You.

18:54.670 --> 18:57.100
You found the one.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.630
I did. Didn't I?

19:12.500 --> 19:14.850
Are you okay?

19:14.850 --> 19:17.100
Oh, my God.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.250
Oh, my God.

19:20.210 --> 19:21.460
Honey, I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

19:21.460 --> 19:24.650
I just... I have a... I have a couple
of burns on my arms. It's nothing.

19:24.650 --> 19:25.660
Okay, I'm coming to get you.

19:25.660 --> 19:26.910
No, Robert. I said I'm fine.

19:26.910 --> 19:28.090
Just tell me where you are.

19:28.090 --> 19:31.050
Oh, God. Robert, I just said I'm fine.

19:31.050 --> 19:37.190
I... I... I called the rental car company, and I... I just
wanted to let you know that I'm gonna be a little late.

19:37.190 --> 19:39.980
It's no big deal.
No big deal?

19:39.980 --> 19:42.740
I mean, thank God you were alone in the car.

19:42.740 --> 19:46.620
Can you imagine what it would've been like if Evan was with you?

19:46.990 --> 19:49.640
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

19:51.930 --> 19:56.520
You know, honey, I have to go because I... I have to
go get the other driver's insurance information, okay?

19:56.520 --> 20:00.210
So I'll see you in a little bit. Okay, bye.

20:03.260 --> 20:07.280
Not that I don't appreciate air bags, but, man.

20:07.450 --> 20:08.900
Let me... let me, uh, let me see yours.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.980
Oh, no. They're... they're okay. They're not that bad.

20:11.980 --> 20:14.030
Did you... did you call a cab?

20:14.030 --> 20:17.920
Uh, no, no.Thout that I'd ride
over to the body shop with you.

20:17.920 --> 20:22.970
Oh, oh, you know, I... I think it's
probably better if I just go on my own.

20:22.970 --> 20:25.210
Kitty, we didn't do anything wrong.

20:25.210 --> 20:27.100
No, I know. I know.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.680
Of... of course. I j... I just...

20:29.680 --> 20:34.720
I don't know. I just kind of feel like
being alone right now, that's all.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.030
Okay.

20:37.550 --> 20:39.180
Oh, thank you.

20:39.850 --> 20:40.500
Thank you.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.140
Sure.

20:41.670 --> 20:43.930
Um, if, uh...

20:44.580 --> 20:46.910
if you need anything, just...

20:47.190 --> 20:48.700
Thanks. You, too.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.070
It's great!

20:58.090 --> 20:59.290
Thank you.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.830
It's just a lot to take in.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.630
Look, it's not completely solved, okay?

21:03.640 --> 21:05.400
I just... I was able to buy you some time.

21:05.420 --> 21:07.260
And Maggie said the interview went great.

21:07.270 --> 21:07.980
She loves you.

21:07.990 --> 21:10.700
We could tell the bank that you're gainfully employed.

21:12.210 --> 21:15.540
Nora, I'm so grateful for everything that both of you have done.

21:15.580 --> 21:16.510
I just...

21:16.540 --> 21:19.320
I d... I don't feel comfortable taking the job.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.030
Why not?

21:21.710 --> 21:25.450
Because there's a grand total of zero
kids at the center that need tutoring.

21:25.460 --> 21:29.980
But there will be soon, and we need
someone to set up the curriculum.

21:31.070 --> 21:35.250
Can I just take some time to think it over I'm just really tired.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.560
Is that okay?
Of course.

21:36.570 --> 21:38.310
Well, look, we'll... we'll let ourselves out.

21:38.330 --> 21:39.070
Okay, that'd be great.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.540
I'll call you tomorrow.

21:42.420 --> 21:43.150
Is she all right?

21:43.160 --> 21:44.120
Yeah, she's fine.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.290
I'm sure she...

21:45.320 --> 21:47.320
She doesn't want to feel like
she's taking advantage of us.

21:47.330 --> 21:49.890
Kevin, airline tickets.

21:52.590 --> 21:53.500
Phoenix.

21:53.510 --> 21:55.870
Kevin, she's going home to live with her parents.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.130
We don't know that yet, okay?

21:58.220 --> 21:59.080
Let's just go.

21:59.090 --> 22:00.100
Let's just go.

22:02.340 --> 22:04.080
All right, so be honest.

22:04.110 --> 22:05.640
You were on your blackberry.

22:05.830 --> 22:06.570
I wasn't.

22:06.580 --> 22:07.240
I wasn't.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.540
I wasn't talking on the...

22:08.560 --> 22:10.000
The phone, and I...

22:10.010 --> 22:11.370
I wasn't texting.

22:11.390 --> 22:12.940
And you just didn't see the car?

22:12.970 --> 22:15.080
No, I didn't see the car. It wasn't my fault.

22:15.090 --> 22:17.320
He just... he just came outta nowhere.

22:17.350 --> 22:19.380
Well, I'm just glad you're okay.

22:19.590 --> 22:21.350
And now I get to take care of you.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.780
It's kind of a nice role reversal.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.030
How's that?

22:29.130 --> 22:31.150
It's better. Thank you.

22:32.870 --> 22:35.360
I don't know. You still look a little shaken up.

22:35.370 --> 22:38.310
Oh, I'm... I'm just tired, that's all.

22:38.350 --> 22:39.460
Why don't you take a nap?

22:39.490 --> 22:40.740
I'll go be with Evan.

22:40.770 --> 22:43.900
Okay, how about we, uh...

22:44.370 --> 22:47.700
have the sitter stay and we go out for dinner?

22:47.720 --> 22:50.410
I'll, uh, I'll treat you to sushi.

22:50.910 --> 22:51.700
You're on.

22:53.420 --> 22:55.720
And I promise, you can drive.

22:55.880 --> 22:56.750
Thanks.

23:00.050 --> 23:01.750
Thank you very much.

23:02.260 --> 23:05.470
Let me see if I have this right.

23:05.590 --> 23:10.850
You want me to authorize the hiring
of another one of William's children.

23:10.910 --> 23:12.340
I see you got my e-mail.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.940
Well, what makes you think I would even consider that?

23:14.970 --> 23:16.070
Because he's a good kid...

23:16.080 --> 23:18.480
who just happens to be William Walker's son.

23:18.490 --> 23:23.420
Oh, listen, Holly I'm sorry that my first
thought wasn't how this might threaten you.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.630
You know what? Just forget it.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.950
Look, Sarah...

23:29.000 --> 23:30.380
I believe you.

23:30.400 --> 23:35.210
But I can't ignore the fact that that would
put me at a further disadvantage here.

23:35.260 --> 23:40.850
If you want to hire him, then
maybe we need to even things out.

23:41.110 --> 23:43.080
What do you have in mind?

23:44.800 --> 23:47.770
Give Rebecca equal shares.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.640
Well, she's certainly deserving.

23:51.690 --> 23:53.100
Yeah, I think so,

23:53.140 --> 23:57.050
and from what I can see from Ryan,
he would make a nice fit around here.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.930
So that would settle it?

24:01.010 --> 24:02.490
Works for me.

24:41.530 --> 24:42.530
Hi, Evan.

24:46.880 --> 24:50.080
You, you are quite a young politician...

24:50.630 --> 24:52.600
making friends wherever you go.

25:00.630 --> 25:05.850
* Oh,oh magnificent *

25:12.000 --> 25:15.650
* I was born *

25:16.160 --> 25:21.980
* I was born to be with you *

25:22.330 --> 25:26.960
* In this space and time after that *

25:28.270 --> 25:34.520
* And ever after I haven't had a clue *

25:34.590 --> 25:40.430
* only to break rhyme this foolishness *

25:40.640 --> 25:46.500
* can leave a heart black and blue *

25:48.490 --> 25:49.450
They're here.

25:49.480 --> 25:50.870
Okay, great.

25:50.890 --> 25:53.740
Would you please take this thing off of here?

25:54.860 --> 25:57.430
Okay, look, let's just try and be a little sensitive, okay?

25:57.440 --> 25:59.280
Let's not criticize her parents.

25:59.300 --> 26:00.960
Well, of course I'll be sensitive,

26:00.970 --> 26:03.470
and besides, her parents are lovely people.

26:03.490 --> 26:05.110
Well, I've played golf with the father.

26:05.120 --> 26:05.770
He's not lovely.

26:05.780 --> 26:08.300
Yes, and her mother smokes, but that's not the point.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.510
The point is, Julia said she didn't want to move back to Arizona.

26:11.530 --> 26:14.510
Right, so I say this completely with love, okay?

26:14.520 --> 26:18.060
We don't know what she wants to tell
us, so please let me do the talking.

26:18.130 --> 26:19.310
All right, fine.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.690
Good. Thank you.

26:22.460 --> 26:23.160
How are you?

26:23.170 --> 26:24.090
Good.

26:24.540 --> 26:25.420
Where's Elizabeth?

26:25.440 --> 26:26.730
Oh, I left her with the sitter.

26:26.740 --> 26:28.200
She had a... a playdate.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.610
You got her another pony?

26:31.480 --> 26:32.490
Kevin did.

26:32.790 --> 26:34.940
Now she has one for both houses.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.110
Right? Come in. Come on.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.620
I'll grab you some coffee.

26:39.570 --> 26:41.600
Listen, I know I was a little weird last night.

26:41.630 --> 26:45.010
I just had a lot of stuff to sort through, and I was up all night thinking...

26:45.020 --> 26:46.700
Julia, we saw the plane tickets.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.350
Great.

26:47.520 --> 26:50.250
Look... please, please, just hear us out before you decide...

26:50.260 --> 26:53.170
Wait, wait, Nora, I told you, those tickets don't mean anything.

26:53.180 --> 26:54.900
My parents sent me those weeks ago.

26:54.910 --> 26:57.130
I... I'm not going back to Phoenix.

26:58.220 --> 26:58.890
Well, thank God.

26:58.900 --> 27:01.260
See? She was practically having a nervous breakdown.

27:01.290 --> 27:06.620
I just did sense a bit of hesitancy
about the job at the center is all.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.350
Well, you were right.

27:09.110 --> 27:13.190
My mentor from college, she started a private school in Seattle.

27:13.230 --> 27:16.800
Yesterday she offered me a job there, and this morning...

27:17.380 --> 27:18.650
I accepted.

27:18.860 --> 27:20.870
She needs me to start next week.

27:21.430 --> 27:22.040
In Seattle?

27:22.050 --> 27:23.340
Y... you're moving to Seattle?

27:23.350 --> 27:26.010
It's a real teaching job at a real school, and...

27:26.020 --> 27:27.040
Well, the center is real.

27:27.050 --> 27:28.730
Who else do you know up there?

27:28.860 --> 27:29.470
Nobody.
Right.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.260
So what, you're gonna go up all by yourself?

27:31.270 --> 27:32.580
Be a single mother in a strange city?

27:32.600 --> 27:34.830
It's not my fault I'm a single mother, Kevin.

27:34.840 --> 27:35.620
I didn't say it was.

27:35.630 --> 27:37.840
I'm just saying, I have Elizabeth's best interests at heart.

27:37.850 --> 27:38.740
I'm her mother.

27:38.750 --> 27:41.050
I think I know what's in her best interest.

27:41.090 --> 27:45.180
Nora, you're the one that told me to
live by my own lights and be independent.

27:45.190 --> 27:47.410
Yes, but you don't have to move to Seattle to do that.

27:47.420 --> 27:49.000
Yes, I do.

27:49.170 --> 27:51.940
You're all helpful until things don't go your way.

27:51.990 --> 27:54.130
And up until a month ago, I would've been fine with that.

27:54.140 --> 27:57.870
Julia, as unforgivable as Tommy's
behavior has been, and it has been,

27:57.880 --> 27:59.380
but he lives here.

27:59.390 --> 28:01.050
Elizabeth is his daughter.

28:01.060 --> 28:03.680
He has a right to have his daughter when he comes back.

28:03.690 --> 28:05.990
I don't believe he's coming back.

28:06.490 --> 28:08.610
But at least you're finally being honest.

28:08.650 --> 28:10.890
It's Elizabeth you want to keep around, not me.

28:10.940 --> 28:11.760
It's not that.

28:11.770 --> 28:12.500
I gotta go.

28:12.520 --> 28:13.440
Julia, Julia...

28:13.450 --> 28:14.570
Julia...

28:14.600 --> 28:16.150
Don't... please...

28:17.040 --> 28:18.240
You'll build up to it. I've got every con...

28:18.250 --> 28:19.600
You needed to see me.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.370
Rebecca, meet your new colleague.

28:25.520 --> 28:28.130
Ryan's starting on the loading dock on Monday.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.130
Congratulations.

28:32.140 --> 28:33.120
Thanks.

28:33.230 --> 28:35.030
I thought I might give it a try.

28:35.060 --> 28:39.100
The reason that we asked you here,
Rebecca, is that Ryan, as William's son,

28:39.110 --> 28:41.740
is entitled to shares on top of his salary.

28:41.780 --> 28:43.210
Oh, I... I didn't know that.

28:43.240 --> 28:47.720
Now your mother and I have come to the
conclusion that you deserve the same thing.

28:47.740 --> 28:52.350
Sarah's already taken it to the
board, and they are backing us.

28:52.370 --> 28:53.190
Congratulations.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.310
We'll go over all the details once we get the paperwork.
Thank you.

28:56.320 --> 28:59.790
So why don't you take him to accounting and help him get started?

28:59.820 --> 29:01.570
Oh, you'll need this.

29:01.590 --> 29:02.620
Yeah, okay.

29:02.650 --> 29:03.470
Thank you.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.690
And I'm really looking forward to Monday.

29:10.370 --> 29:12.190
I think we did the right thing.

29:17.010 --> 29:19.120
I'm sorry I reacted that way about the money.

29:19.140 --> 29:21.020
I know you were just trying to
make sure they're gonna be okay.

29:21.030 --> 29:22.610
You had every reason to be worried about the money.

29:22.620 --> 29:23.300
But I'm not.

29:23.310 --> 29:25.100
I mean, I am, a little.

29:27.020 --> 29:27.900
It's you I'm worried about.

29:27.910 --> 29:28.620
I'm fine.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.050
You know, I'm just a little tired of feeling I have to make up for Tommy

29:31.060 --> 29:32.960
being such a failure as a father.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.450
I did everything he wanted.

29:34.470 --> 29:38.300
I was a sperm donor when I had
some serious reservations about it.

29:38.310 --> 29:42.500
He was so eager for a child, and he promised me

29:42.510 --> 29:45.630
I wouldn't have to find out who the biological father was.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.700
Then he made me sign this...

29:50.030 --> 29:52.960
stupid contract saying I'd never tell Elizabeth the truth,

29:52.970 --> 29:56.800
all under this promise of being a great father.

29:57.310 --> 29:59.000
And then he left.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.940
He'll come back...

30:03.230 --> 30:04.450
Eventually.

30:04.710 --> 30:05.980
It doesn't matter.

30:07.110 --> 30:07.790
Too much has happened.

30:07.800 --> 30:10.990
Even if he did come back, I could never forgive him.

30:12.260 --> 30:13.140
It's over.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.540
Kevin, I am so sorry.

30:19.310 --> 30:22.340
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

30:22.360 --> 30:23.370
Oh, please, Nora.

30:23.380 --> 30:24.530
It's not hell.

30:24.550 --> 30:25.740
It's Seattle.

30:26.770 --> 30:27.400
Yeah, well, she's right.

30:27.410 --> 30:30.550
I don't want her to leave and take my
granddaughter thousands of miles away.

30:30.560 --> 30:36.070
I want her to stay here so that Tommy has a
wife and a child and a home to come back to.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.880
Nora, you have to let go...

30:39.000 --> 30:40.490
Even Tommy.

30:42.010 --> 30:44.160
Julia needs to move on.

30:46.410 --> 30:47.830
How do I do that?

30:48.720 --> 30:51.050
Start by wishing her well.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.420
I could give her a dinner.

30:57.460 --> 30:59.040
There you go.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.840
You could've died in that car.

31:27.490 --> 31:32.310
And all I'd be left with is a motherless
little boy and the image of my wife in a car

31:32.320 --> 31:35.000
with some man that I had never even heard of.

31:36.090 --> 31:36.970
It's not what you think.

31:36.980 --> 31:43.020
This is so much bigger than being about whatever
you and that guy were doing or not doing.

31:43.090 --> 31:45.070
I know things have been difficult.

31:45.180 --> 31:47.690
I know that I have my flaws.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.420
But I have been trying.
I know.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.410
And I wonder...
No, Robert, I...

31:50.420 --> 31:51.390
Why I've even bothered.

31:51.400 --> 31:52.930
Do you want this marriage?

31:53.230 --> 31:54.150
Of course I do.

31:54.170 --> 31:56.000
I think that we just have to figure things out.

31:56.010 --> 31:58.000
We don't need to figure anything out.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.180
You do.

32:00.090 --> 32:00.700
Wait, wait, wait.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.450
Robert, wait, please. Please, just...

32:05.830 --> 32:07.270
I'm sorry.

32:08.420 --> 32:09.980
Do you love him?

32:18.420 --> 32:20.840
Then we don't have anything to talk about.

32:31.170 --> 32:32.780
Nora, is this wild King Salmon?

32:32.800 --> 32:36.570
Yes, flown in fresh today from Seattle in honor of Julia.

32:36.590 --> 32:39.200
Hey, Julia, the house... any interest yet?

32:39.210 --> 32:40.300
Not yet.

32:40.350 --> 32:42.960
But thanks to Kevin, I can wait for a decent offer.

32:42.990 --> 32:44.270
Oh, well done.

32:44.300 --> 32:46.460
Kitty, would you like me to make a plate for Robert?

32:46.470 --> 32:47.680
I have some chicken soup.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.440
Why, is Robert sick?
No.

32:49.450 --> 32:50.920
Well, yeah... no, he is.

32:50.930 --> 32:51.900
No, he's not.
Yes, he is.

32:51.910 --> 32:53.360
Yeah, he has a cold.
Well, he called me 12 times today.

32:53.370 --> 32:54.210
He didn't sound sick.

32:54.220 --> 32:55.110
He has a cold.

32:55.130 --> 32:56.780
He didn't sound sick to me.

32:57.030 --> 32:58.210
Excuse me.

32:58.380 --> 33:03.020
I'm actually gonna call him and,
uh, see if he's feeling any better.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.550
Sarah, when does Ryan start?

33:06.820 --> 33:07.530
Start what?

33:07.550 --> 33:10.520
Ryan's gonna be working at Ojai. He starts Monday.

33:10.780 --> 33:11.570
You are kidding me.

33:11.590 --> 33:12.460
What?

33:12.480 --> 33:14.230
Well, don't tell me he's a shareholder now, too.

33:14.770 --> 33:15.380
I think it's great.

33:15.390 --> 33:17.230
He's interested in the family business.

33:17.260 --> 33:17.910
That's great, mom.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.080
Why don't you just hand him keys to the entire kingdom?

33:20.090 --> 33:20.980
Oh, just settle down.

33:20.990 --> 33:23.450
The only keys he's gonna have is to
the loading dock. What's your problem?

33:23.460 --> 33:25.400
The kid's a... the kid's a fake, all right?

33:25.410 --> 33:27.380
I can't believe you guys are buying into his act.

33:27.390 --> 33:30.470
He has all you women clucking around
like you're... you're female chickens.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.480
Hens, dear.

33:33.010 --> 33:33.940
Does Rebecca know?

33:33.960 --> 33:36.140
Yeah, I heard her clucking.

33:36.690 --> 33:37.990
That's really funny.

33:38.930 --> 33:40.010
Anyone want more wine?

33:40.020 --> 33:40.630
I'll have some.

33:40.640 --> 33:41.560
Yes, please.
Thank you.

33:41.570 --> 33:43.090
Bring two bottles.

33:46.820 --> 33:49.830
The old "need more wine" exit ruse...

33:49.860 --> 33:52.300
amazing how they never catch on.

33:53.830 --> 33:56.080
Sorry. I just... I, um...

33:56.190 --> 33:57.980
had to get out of there.

33:58.830 --> 34:01.370
Robert doesn't have a cold, does he?

34:01.830 --> 34:02.700
No.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.110
No. He, uh...

34:05.900 --> 34:08.190
he found out about Alec.

34:08.489 --> 34:10.000
Oh, God, no.

34:10.139 --> 34:11.510
You should've seen his face, Sarah.

34:11.520 --> 34:15.610
He was so hurt, and he was so angry, and I don't blame him.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.929
And you were so right.

34:18.820 --> 34:20.000
It's horrific.

34:20.040 --> 34:23.010
No, listen, I forgot to say the most important thing,

34:23.030 --> 34:25.989
which is one, I am on your side...

34:26.969 --> 34:31.179
and two, you will get through this no matter what happens.

34:31.949 --> 34:33.050
You will.

34:37.670 --> 34:39.389
So this is what you were doing all day.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.030
I didn't know that you were a chef, too.

34:41.050 --> 34:43.679
Yeah, well, I am a one-dish wonder.

34:43.710 --> 34:48.870
Hopefully when I make my, uh, first paycheck,
I'll be able to take you out on a real date.

34:49.449 --> 34:50.800
Or not.

34:53.320 --> 34:54.159
What's wrong?

34:54.179 --> 34:54.980
No, n... nothing.

34:54.989 --> 34:58.710
I just, um, think I'm still trying to wrap my head around...

34:58.730 --> 34:59.810
you working at Ojai.

34:59.820 --> 35:02.550
I mean, yesterday you couldn't have
been more opposed to the idea,

35:02.560 --> 35:03.580
and... and now...

35:03.590 --> 35:05.600
Now I'm an employee and a shareholder.

35:05.610 --> 35:06.680
I know. It's crazy, right?

35:06.700 --> 35:08.440
No, it's... I mean, I... I think it's great.

35:08.450 --> 35:09.440
It's a great idea.

35:09.460 --> 35:13.010
I just... I want to make sure that it's good for you.

35:13.110 --> 35:15.660
Are you kidding? It's perfect.

35:15.700 --> 35:17.800
And I owe it all to you and your mom.

35:17.830 --> 35:21.770
Trust me, she's gonna know how grateful
I am when I get into that boardroom.

35:22.610 --> 35:23.740
What do you mean?

35:25.240 --> 35:28.240
Well, those shares we got give us voting power, right?

35:29.720 --> 35:32.130
So you're automatically gonna vote with her?

35:32.160 --> 35:33.930
I can't wait to see the look on Sarah's face.

35:33.950 --> 35:37.350
She's gonna have a coronary right there in the boardroom.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.110
Can I tell you something, Kevin?

35:42.120 --> 35:45.940
This chilean chardonnay... it's the best thing I've ever tasted.

35:45.970 --> 35:48.110
I know. It doesn't have that overpowering oak taste.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.780
Oh, excuse me. Is that a little slight against Walker Landing?

35:50.800 --> 35:53.680
I just wanted Julia to have a night free of Tommy reminders.

35:53.930 --> 35:55.010
I'm sorry, Julia.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.750
No, it's okay. He is pretty much the elephant in the room.

35:57.770 --> 36:00.650
Will all of you please just behave?

36:00.670 --> 36:02.850
Sorry, Julia. Tonight is your dinner.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.420
No, don't apologize.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.720
I'm actually gonna miss these dinners.

36:06.750 --> 36:09.130
You know, I hear the people in Seattle...
they're much nicer than we are.

36:09.140 --> 36:10.430
Yeah, they're almost canadian.

36:10.440 --> 36:11.170
Almost.

36:11.190 --> 36:11.860
Yes.

36:13.520 --> 36:14.780
I'd like to propose a toast.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.550
No, absolutely not, because tonight we're toasting you.

36:18.150 --> 36:19.140
To Julia.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.570
No, I want to toast all of you.

36:20.580 --> 36:22.240
I never get to do that at these dinners.

36:22.250 --> 36:23.760
Well, that's because Kevin never let you get a word in edgewise.

36:23.770 --> 36:24.890
Oh, shut up.

36:24.910 --> 36:26.990
That's not true. You always interrupted.

36:41.460 --> 36:45.350
This move is one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make.

36:45.380 --> 36:50.300
But I've watched all of you make really hard decisions in your lives.

36:50.330 --> 36:53.960
You've gotten through them by supporting each other,

36:54.180 --> 36:56.140
and that's what you've done for me.

36:56.170 --> 37:00.890
And I know that you'll do that for Tommy, too, whatever happens.

37:03.890 --> 37:09.650
So really this is a toast to all of you and to making hard choices.

37:11.250 --> 37:11.950
To hard choices.

37:13.350 --> 37:15.550
Cheers.
Cheers.

37:17.580 --> 37:20.090
Okay, I'm gonna let go before I start to cry.

37:21.510 --> 37:23.990
I can't believe you're leaving me with these crazy Walkers.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.370
Well, we'll always have Facebook.

37:28.340 --> 37:29.990
I'll, uh, wait for you in the car.

37:30.730 --> 37:32.440
Bye.
Bye, Scotty.

37:32.930 --> 37:35.690
Kevin, I just want to say, thank you so much.

37:36.030 --> 37:38.600
I eat mortgage brokers for lunch.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.470
I've made a decision.

37:41.510 --> 37:43.530
I'm gonna tell Elizabeth the truth.

37:43.560 --> 37:48.710
You gave her life twice, and you and she are connected,

37:48.720 --> 37:51.480
and I... I gotta make sure it stays that way.

37:52.700 --> 37:53.900
Thank you.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.600
I couldn't find her other blankie.

37:56.620 --> 37:58.790
Oh, I found it. It's in her bag.

37:59.530 --> 38:00.380
Is everyone gone?

38:00.400 --> 38:01.850
Yeah, it's just us.

38:02.580 --> 38:03.760
Hi, baby.

38:03.780 --> 38:05.160
You want to go to mama?

38:05.180 --> 38:06.350
Come here, baby girl.

38:06.370 --> 38:07.620
I've been dreading this moment.

38:07.640 --> 38:09.900
I know.
Me, too.

38:11.780 --> 38:13.500
Bye, baby girl.

38:15.820 --> 38:16.440
Bye, mama.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.740
Bye.

38:17.900 --> 38:19.430
Why don't we help you to the car?

38:19.440 --> 38:20.470
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

38:20.490 --> 38:23.140
I gotta learn to do this myself, right?

38:25.430 --> 38:26.450
All right. Bye.

38:26.460 --> 38:27.380
Bye.

38:30.200 --> 38:30.840
Bye.

38:33.780 --> 38:35.080
Can you say bye bye?

38:35.100 --> 38:35.780
Bye bye.

38:35.820 --> 38:37.500
That's a good girl.

38:37.700 --> 38:39.420
All right. Bye.

38:39.470 --> 38:44.530
* Who dreamed of a little home for me *

38:45.930 --> 38:49.140
* I played pretend between the trees *

38:49.150 --> 38:52.500
* And fed my houseguests bark and leaves *

38:52.510 --> 38:56.330
* And laughed in my pretty bed of green *

38:56.340 --> 38:57.640
Or hello.

38:58.030 --> 39:00.180
I'm sorry. I... I need to talk to you.

39:00.220 --> 39:02.990
I... I'm sorry. I don't know how to say this.

39:03.530 --> 39:05.050
Uh, it... it's okay.

39:05.070 --> 39:06.300
Just... just go ahead.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.640
It's about Ryan. We just had dinner.

39:08.660 --> 39:10.380
You know what? Look, I know we're friends now,

39:10.410 --> 39:11.900
but I don't need a play-by-play of your love life.

39:11.910 --> 39:14.200
Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

39:16.160 --> 39:20.640
Do you remember when you told me that
there was something about him you didn't trust?

39:22.820 --> 39:24.680
Justin, I think you were right.

39:24.880 --> 39:30.480
* I asked god who I'm supposed to be *

39:31.360 --> 39:36.260
* The stars smiled down on me god answered...*

39:36.270 --> 39:37.620
What is all this?

39:37.750 --> 39:39.600
Tommy's things.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.570
He doesn't have a home any more,

39:41.580 --> 39:44.570
so I'm gonna get a place ready for him for when he gets back.

39:44.590 --> 39:47.080
Nora, don't do this.

39:47.110 --> 39:48.720
He's my son.

39:48.830 --> 39:50.630
I can't give up hope.

39:51.240 --> 39:56.140
* Highest tree I had a dream *

40:41.420 --> 40:44.680
I guess I probably should've brought a pitcher of lemonade.

40:46.550 --> 40:50.110
Well... I, uh...

40:50.840 --> 40:53.000
brought you these instead.

40:53.030 --> 40:54.950
You left your escrow papers in the car.

40:54.970 --> 40:56.150
Thank you.

40:57.370 --> 40:58.810
I was gonna mail 'em, but...

40:58.830 --> 41:01.860
* I don't know what's left to say *

41:01.870 --> 41:07.590
* about this life I'm willing to leave *

41:08.540 --> 41:09.790
* I lived it full *

41:09.810 --> 41:11.050
But?

41:12.460 --> 41:14.540
Well, it, uh...

41:16.680 --> 41:18.370
turns out that...

41:18.420 --> 41:22.280
a porch swing doesn't actually solve all your problems.

41:22.550 --> 41:23.600
No.

41:24.060 --> 41:32.320
* to fly from the highest wing *

41:33.980 --> 41:37.610
* I had a dream *

41:44.110 --> 41:44.830
What are we gonna do?

41:44.850 --> 41:46.370
I don't know.

41:47.470 --> 41:48.940
I don't know.
