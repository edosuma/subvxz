00:45.478 --> 00:47.879

00:47.947 --> 00:50.507
there are millions
of teenagers out there...

00:50.583 --> 00:54.884
going through exactly what
you're going through right now.

<i>Let me assure you- this is

01:00.827 --> 01:03.524
Can you try and tell me
what's been going on?

01:10.170 --> 01:14.232
Well, I guess the natural
place to start is...

01:14.307 --> 01:16.571
that I'm an alien.

01:17.710 --> 01:20.941
A hybrid, actually.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.574
You know, human D.N.A.

01:36.262 --> 01:40.130
<i>For the past 70 years,
we've been aging much like humans.</i>

01:40.200 --> 01:42.464
<i>Clearly, there are differences.</i>

01:42.535 --> 01:45.300
<i>From the beginning, we had
the instinct to keep this to ourselves.</i>

01:45.371 --> 01:47.305

02:17.837 --> 02:19.999
<i>He's a shape-shifter...</i>

02:20.073 --> 02:22.940

<i>Fortunately, we used Nasedds abilities

02:40.026 --> 02:42.586

Mr. Pierce, how much
of that spending by the Special Unit...

04:46.886 --> 04:48.877
was authorized by your superiors?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.889
None.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.891
Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Pierce.
What?

04:52.959 --> 04:54.893
My hearing isn't

04:54.961 --> 04:57.396
Why don't you just speak
right into the mike?

04:58.831 --> 05:02.665
- None.
- Oh, none. Not a penny.

05:02.735 --> 05:06.433
Seventeen million dollars
spent by the so-called-

05:06.506 --> 05:09.567
- <i>Max, you're a genius.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

05:09.642 --> 05:13.135
Having Nasedo pose as Pierce. You know,
make a mockery of the Special Unit...

05:13.212 --> 05:15.340
and the government threat
against you- It's really smart.

05:15.415 --> 05:19.511
I had nothing to do with it. I haven't
heard from Nasedo in three months.

05:19.585 --> 05:23.579
Well, if Nasedo can put an end
to the Special Unit...

05:23.656 --> 05:25.954

and nothing has happened.

05:31.798 --> 05:34.392
No aliens have shown up.

05:34.467 --> 05:37.437
Maybe there's no one out there.
Maybe the war is over.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.234
Or thousands of them could be
lining up outside of town right now.

live our lives in fear like Michael.

<i>left on the skin

06:33.359 --> 06:37.626
Yet the internal organs

06:37.697 --> 06:39.631
were completely decimated.

06:39.699 --> 06:43.158

06:43.236 --> 06:46.331

<i>an element which

07:50.102 --> 07:53.504
No, I was- I was just wondering
if you'd heard from Liz yet.

07:53.573 --> 07:57.203
Not since you asked me
an hour ago, no.

07:58.911 --> 08:02.313
- I heard you on the phone with her.
- Max. Little advice.

08:02.381 --> 08:05.214
The girl goes off to some aunt
in Florida for the entire summer...

08:05.284 --> 08:07.218

good-bye to you.

08:07.286 --> 08:10.586

“Did Liz call?“ No, that's no good.

08:25.638 --> 08:28.130
- Let her come to me.
- That's what I'd do.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.467
Wait. Didn't you just
tell me that you left...

08:31.544 --> 08:34.275

08:50.963 --> 08:54.797
Sure. Look.
There are four showings on Saturday.

08:54.867 --> 08:59.134

- Excuse me.

- Isabel Evans.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.263
Alex Whitman.

09:26.332 --> 09:30.496
I was wondering if you might be able
to tell me where I could find the sheriff's office.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.599
Why are you looking
for the sheriff?

09:44.517 --> 09:48.044
- Could be a coyote.
- Why would anyone bury a coyote?

09:48.120 --> 09:50.111
Where'd you find this?

09:50.189 --> 09:52.954
Thirty miles northeast of here,
off the old Clovis Highway.

09:56.295 --> 09:59.287
That's a pretty isolated place
to be digging around.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.299
What were you doing up there?

10:01.367 --> 10:05.395
- Geological survey.
- I see.

10:05.471 --> 10:08.202
There's one thing that I can't quite explain.
I was using a Lorenz Pulse Five.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.242
<i>Basically, a fancy
meta! detector.</i>

10:10.309 --> 10:12.801
Why would a metal detector
detect bones?

10:14.880 --> 10:17.645
Okay, I just got
goose bumps.

10:17.717 --> 10:21.676
You did the right thing by bringing this
to my attention, Mr. Sorenson.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.348
I'll look into it immediately.

10:24.423 --> 10:27.154
Sure. Thank you, Sheriff.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.663
You don't even need
to say it, Sheriff.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.859
I'll get an excavation team
out there right away.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.066
We think somebody found
Pierce's bones.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.407
- You're kidding.
- A geologist.

11:20.479 --> 11:23.312
What the hell was he doing
digging around in the middle of nowhere?

- He'll take care of it.
- What about Nasedo?

11:35.795 --> 11:39.254
- He told us not to contact him unless there
was an emergency. - So what do you call this?

11:39.331 --> 11:42.631
<i>I mean, what if this guys not a geologist?
What if he's one of our enemies, Max?</i>

11:42.702 --> 11:45.000
Right now there's no reason
to doubt him.

11:45.071 --> 11:48.564
He's a geologist, and in the course
of doing hisjob, he dug up the bones.

11:48.641 --> 11:52.100
I'll decide
when we call Nasedo.

11:52.178 --> 11:54.510
Don't do anything
until I tell you.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.446
I'm not just gonna sit around
like we've done all summer.

11:56.515 --> 11:58.677

12:01.987 --> 12:04.649

- Fine. Crack some more rocks.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.961
Let's not panic.

- Let's see.
- I'm all over it, Sheriff.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.704
I called the lab. I'm gonna run it over right
now and have them check it for prints.

13:30.776 --> 13:32.710
Good work, Hanson.

13:32.778 --> 13:36.271
Looks like we could have
an actual homicide on our hands.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.468
What the hell-

14:13.752 --> 14:16.881
Maybe Michael's right.
Maybe we should check out the geologist.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.288
Valenti already did.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.452
He has a degree from
the University of Wyoming...

14:21.527 --> 14:23.552
and was hired to do
fieldwork in the area.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.826
Nasedo had
a pretty good cover too.

14:26.899 --> 14:29.732
- <i>I'll</i> talk to him later.

14:56.761 --> 14:59.628

- Yeah, I know she did.

15:04.936 --> 15:07.871
Yeah, yeah.
I understand.

15:07.939 --> 15:09.873
Listen, Liz. I--

15:09.941 --> 15:13.002
I know how strange everything got
before you left.

15:13.077 --> 15:15.637
But I think it's okay.

15:15.713 --> 15:18.114
No aliens have attacked.

15:18.182 --> 15:21.550
Nasedo is putting an end

15:21.619 --> 15:23.553

could finally be over.

15:23.621 --> 15:26.420
Oh, I really hope that's true.
For all of you.

15:28.159 --> 15:31.220
- And I just want you to know about
the whole Tess situation- - Oh, Max.

15:31.295 --> 15:34.731
- You don't have to-
-just that it's definitely over.

15:34.799 --> 15:37.496
I don't have
feelings for her.

15:37.568 --> 15:40.765
I've told her that,
and she understands.

15:42.540 --> 15:45.271
<i>I know it's probably
irrelevant at this point...</i>

15:45.343 --> 15:47.505
but... just for the record.

15:47.578 --> 15:51.537
Right. You know,
I just want to get a fresh start.

15:51.616 --> 15:54.608
- I've decided-
- Right. Right. Anyways, you look...

15:54.685 --> 15:58.280
- Oh!
- great.

15:58.356 --> 16:01.382
Different.

16:01.459 --> 16:04.520
Oh. I have, um,
a job interview, actually.

16:04.595 --> 16:07.121
Oh.
What about the Crashdown?

16:07.198 --> 16:11.294
Well, this really incredible opportunity
came up sort of out of the blue-

16:11.369 --> 16:16.364
- You must be Liz Parker. - Congresswoman
Whitaker. It is so nice to meet you.

16:16.440 --> 16:19.705
- You are a real hero to me.
- You don't need to suck up. Really.

16:19.777 --> 16:23.736
<i>My paid staff takes care
of my enormous ego.</i>

16:23.814 --> 16:26.579
Oh, so there's, um,
not an actual salary?

16:26.651 --> 16:29.712
We have a lot
to talk about. Hi.

16:29.787 --> 16:32.449
I'm sorry.
This is Max Evans. A friend.

16:32.523 --> 16:35.720
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.</i>

16:35.793 --> 16:38.819
- <i>Shall we step inside?</i>
- Yeah. Sure. <i>That'd be great.</i>

16:50.174 --> 16:54.441
This is the suspect, Sheriff.
He came in peaceably...

16:54.512 --> 16:57.174
although I do see a bit
ofan attitude problem.

16:59.650 --> 17:01.914
You recognize that?

17:05.790 --> 17:08.589
Well, there's a lot of knives
out there that look like that.

17:08.659 --> 17:12.185
How many of them do you suppose have
your fingerprints on them, Mr. Guerin?

17:13.631 --> 17:17.499
My very efficient deputy here
has linked this knife to you.

17:17.568 --> 17:20.401
It was discovered
way out in the desert...

17:20.471 --> 17:22.462
out near
the old Clovis Highway.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.976
You remember our little meeting
out there a few months ago?

17:26.042 --> 17:28.204
Or do I have to refresh
your memory?

17:29.914 --> 17:31.848
Yeah,
maybe you'd better.

17:31.916 --> 17:35.682
I found you and two
of your buddies...

17:35.753 --> 17:37.619
drinking beer,
joyriding...

17:37.688 --> 17:40.214

into the desert.

17:40.291 --> 17:43.522
- Remember?
- Yeah.

17:43.594 --> 17:48.225
Here's the police report I filled out
that night just in case you forgot.

17:51.502 --> 17:54.563
Now, did you witness...

17:54.639 --> 17:57.336
<i>anything out of the ordinary

17:59.644 --> 18:01.738
No, sir.

18:05.449 --> 18:07.816
All right.

18:07.885 --> 18:10.047

a favor.

18:10.121 --> 18:14.558

law somewhere, don't leave a calling card.

Really?

19:15.453 --> 19:18.787
Well, Roswell's
a small town.

19:18.856 --> 19:22.759
When something interesting pops up,
sometimes your curiosity gets the best of you.

19:22.827 --> 19:25.888
- “Something interesting“?
- Like the bones you dug up.

19:25.963 --> 19:28.728
Oh, the bones.

19:28.799 --> 19:32.235
It seems like such a romanticjob-
being a geologist...

19:32.303 --> 19:34.237
studying the earth.

19:34.305 --> 19:36.239
What exactly are you
doing up here?

19:36.307 --> 19:38.639
I'm testing the area
for radioactivity.

19:39.910 --> 19:41.844
You're kidding.
Here?

19:41.912 --> 19:45.109
Apparently, there had been some
nuclear testing in the '50s.

19:45.182 --> 19:47.844
Oh. Okay, so you're here
to make sure it's safe for the public.

19:47.918 --> 19:52.412
Actually, I'm here to make sure it's safe for
a huge corporation to open a chemical plant.

19:52.490 --> 19:54.686
Oh.

19:54.759 --> 19:57.660
They're the ones who commissioned me
to do the survey.

19:57.728 --> 20:00.595
Wouldn't a big chemical plant
just pollute the area anyway?

20:00.664 --> 20:03.099
Does my job still
seem so romantic?

20:03.167 --> 20:06.501
Well, beats working
at the cheese factory.

20:08.072 --> 20:11.599
Well, let's just cut to the chase,
shall we, Sheriff?

20:11.675 --> 20:15.043
This is a piece of a phone conversation
I had with Agent Pierce...

20:15.112 --> 20:18.047
when he first came
to Roswell.

20:18.115 --> 20:21.085
- [Whitaker's Voice] How's it going there?
- [ Pierce] Don't know yet.

20:21.152 --> 20:23.143
My first move is to look into
the sheriff here.

20:23.220 --> 20:25.655
<i>I think he may be the key
to everything.</i>

20:27.424 --> 20:30.553
That's the last I heard from him
until he returned to Washington.

20:30.628 --> 20:32.790
That's when he started
lying to me.

20:37.134 --> 20:39.831
Congresswoman Whitaker...

20:39.904 --> 20:43.534
I would strongly advise that you not
spend too much more energy...

I mean, you just might find yourself
out of a job like your friend Mr. Pierce.

20:51.816 --> 20:53.910
How odd.

20:53.984 --> 20:56.316

like a threat.

- I'll be with you in a minute.
- I just got the coroner's report back and-

21:03.828 --> 21:05.990
Thank you, Deputy.
I'll look it over when I get a chance.

- “Murder victim”?

21:11.335 --> 21:13.394
There isn't any

21:13.470 --> 21:15.734
It's some bones
that were dug up by a geologist.

21:15.806 --> 21:18.366
We don't even know
if they're human.

21:18.442 --> 21:21.173
<i>[ Man]
There's no doubt the bones are human.</i>

the interesting part of all this.

- Listen to this.
- See this mass of bone structure?

21:27.051 --> 21:31.249
- What about it? - Now, compare it
to this other side of the rib cage.

21:31.322 --> 21:35.384
<i>This side has been melted
and fused together.</i>

21:35.459 --> 21:38.918
The corpse was clearly in a fire.
What's your point?

21:38.996 --> 21:42.626
<i>Well, fire or no fire,
bone doesn't melt.</i>

21:42.700 --> 21:45.567
Only some bizarre form
of radiation could do this.

21:45.636 --> 21:48.697
<i>Any nuclear accidents
in the area, Sheriff?</i>

21:48.772 --> 21:52.936
What we have here was caused by
a short and very contained burst...

21:53.010 --> 21:55.536
of unthinkable energy.

21:55.613 --> 21:58.412
I'm gonna start
a full-blown investigation.

22:00.517 --> 22:03.418

Why don't you go back to your office,
and I'll keep you informed as things develop.

22:06.991 --> 22:10.825

I think I'll stay right here.

to you...

22:17.635 --> 22:21.629
I have no intention of leaving this
situation in the hands of a county sheriff.

22:21.705 --> 22:25.141
This is now a matter
of federal interest.

22:25.209 --> 22:29.168

of consulting with the F.B.l. on this.

22:29.246 --> 22:31.510
No, I'll consult

one will be appointed for you by the court.

So, what brings a, uh, out-of-work

to be for a recovering alien hunter.

- Nothing I could say in front of your new intern.

the tip of the iceberg.

when Michael killed Pierce.
