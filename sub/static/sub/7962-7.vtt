WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:04.888
BILL:
<i> You really think Jack</i>
<i> can handle this case?</i>

00:04.890 --> 00:06.423
CHARLIE:
<i> Yeah, he's a lawyer.</i>

00:06.425 --> 00:07.857
FRANK:
<i> Besides, Bill, you're broke.</i>

00:07.859 --> 00:09.359
He's the best lawyer
you can afford.

00:09.361 --> 00:10.927
Yeah, Bill, you got to relax,
okay? Uncle Jack

00:10.929 --> 00:13.630
and I-- we got this case.
Now-now, listen to me.

00:13.632 --> 00:15.465
Liam McPoyle's gonna
come at you hard, all right?

00:15.467 --> 00:17.600
But-but I've done my research.
I got something with this

00:17.602 --> 00:19.102
bird theory that's gonna
blow the court away.
I-I...

00:19.104 --> 00:20.637
I don't... I don't think
we should pursue

00:20.639 --> 00:22.138
this bird nonsense, Charlie.
Yes.

00:22.140 --> 00:23.773
I-I'm well-versed in bird law.
Look,

00:23.775 --> 00:26.376
Pondy, keep your
eye on the prize.

00:26.378 --> 00:28.611
This goes well,
it's party time.

00:28.613 --> 00:30.079
What is that?

00:30.081 --> 00:31.915
Is that... is that drugs, Frank?
Yeah.

00:31.917 --> 00:33.283
No, dude, I need you
keeping him clean,

00:33.285 --> 00:34.551
all right?
That's why you're here.

00:34.553 --> 00:35.552
I got to have
the drugs here

00:35.554 --> 00:36.719
to keep him clean.

00:36.721 --> 00:37.787
Well, that doesn't make sense.

00:37.789 --> 00:39.088
I... Get rid
of the drugs, Frank.

00:39.090 --> 00:40.757
I-I don't want that.
Hey, boys.

00:40.759 --> 00:42.892
You ready for the big show?
Yes, good, how you feeling?

00:42.894 --> 00:44.494
You good, you do your homework,
you know your talking points?
Yeah.

00:44.496 --> 00:46.296
Yeah, I'm good.
Yeah, cool as a cucumber.

00:46.298 --> 00:48.231
You can...
you can get off my back.
Well, don't sass me,

00:48.233 --> 00:50.099
I just... It was just a general
Well, then don't hound me.

00:50.101 --> 00:52.302
question, Dee.
I'm just saying
if you don't want sass,

00:52.304 --> 00:54.404
then you should probably
stop being a hound.
All right, whatever.

00:54.406 --> 00:55.972
Mac, why are you here?

00:55.974 --> 00:58.641
This is your big day, dude.
McPoyle suing Ponderosa?

00:58.643 --> 01:00.643
It's huge, it's like the
trial of the century.

01:00.645 --> 01:03.079
Come on, man, everybody's got
a thing. Don't leave me out.

01:03.081 --> 01:06.416
Frank's got a thing, Dee's got a
thing. Dennis has got a thing.

01:06.418 --> 01:07.684
Dennis has a thing--
what are you talking about?

01:07.686 --> 01:10.753
Oh!
D... What are you doing here?

01:10.755 --> 01:12.021
There's got to be a way
to get this court

01:12.023 --> 01:13.623
to let me out
of my alimony payments.

01:13.625 --> 01:16.025
I mean, have you guys seen
Maureen? The woman has gone

01:16.027 --> 01:17.427
almost full cat.
It's-it's madness.

01:17.429 --> 01:19.095
I shouldn't have
to pay for that,

01:19.097 --> 01:20.964
so I'm gonna talk to the judge,
get him to throw it

01:20.966 --> 01:22.265
on the docket,
you know what I mean?

01:22.267 --> 01:23.666
No, absolutely not.

01:23.668 --> 01:25.001
That's gonna distract
from my case.

01:25.003 --> 01:26.102
Buddy, you don't
have a case, okay?

01:26.104 --> 01:27.604
You are not a lawyer.

01:27.606 --> 01:29.205
Uncle Jack's just
got you here handling

01:29.207 --> 01:30.673
his papers for him
'cause he can't do it

01:30.675 --> 01:32.008
'cause he's wearing
those goddamn...

01:32.010 --> 01:34.277
big hands over
his hands.

01:34.279 --> 01:36.546
I don't know what that
is. What is that?
I don't know what it is.

01:36.548 --> 01:38.348
All right, well, either way,
this whole thing's gonna be

01:38.350 --> 01:39.983
a goddamn fiasco, and I'm gonna
enjoy every second of it.

01:39.985 --> 01:42.118
No, it's gonna
go fine.
No, it isn't.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.053
No, it's gonna be fine.
This is hardly the trial

01:44.055 --> 01:47.357
of the century. Everything's
gonna go just great.

02:11.550 --> 02:13.249
On a scale of one to ten,
how much sass

02:13.251 --> 02:15.151
are you gonna give me today?
A-Are you serious?

02:15.153 --> 02:18.087
And hello to... you all.

02:18.089 --> 02:19.722
What's the Jew lawyer
doing here?

02:19.724 --> 02:21.324
Not Jewish,
and even if I was,

02:21.326 --> 02:23.493
what difference
would it make?

02:23.495 --> 02:25.061
I meant that
as a compliment.

02:25.063 --> 02:27.530
Everybody knows
Jews are the best lawyers.

02:27.532 --> 02:30.166
I can't wait
to crush you people.

02:30.168 --> 02:33.002
I'll be representing
Liam McPoyle today.

02:33.004 --> 02:34.704
Where is Liam?
Well, he actually
got pinkeye

02:34.706 --> 02:36.506
in his one good eye.

02:36.508 --> 02:39.275
Well, in truth, someone
named Doc McPoyle

02:39.277 --> 02:42.345
attempted to put some sort of
healing milk in his pinkeye

02:42.347 --> 02:44.347
and it got infected,
but that doesn't matter.

02:44.349 --> 02:45.782
The point is...

02:45.784 --> 02:48.384
you'll be dealing
with me today.

02:48.386 --> 02:50.587
And you'll be dealing
with me today.

02:50.589 --> 02:52.355
Jack Kelly, lawyer.

02:52.357 --> 02:54.557
Good to see you again.

02:54.559 --> 02:56.459
Are those fake hands?

02:56.461 --> 02:59.395
No.
Are those fake hands?

02:59.397 --> 03:02.532
You know what, good luck
with all of that today.

03:02.534 --> 03:04.601
(sighs)

03:06.738 --> 03:08.871
Did you see his hands?
They're beautiful.

03:08.873 --> 03:10.907
I think we should settle.
What...
Jesus Christ.

03:10.909 --> 03:13.076
I'm going to prison.
It's gonna be fine.

03:13.078 --> 03:14.777
67th District Court
is now in session.

03:14.779 --> 03:16.713
Judge Clarence Melvoy
presiding.

03:16.715 --> 03:19.315
Please remove your hats and
turn off your cell phones.

03:19.317 --> 03:23.152
Okay. We have
<i> McPoyle v. Ponderosa.</i>

03:23.154 --> 03:25.788
Seeking damages for the loss
of an eye in the form

03:25.790 --> 03:28.658
of a one-time payment
to the sum of...

03:28.660 --> 03:31.127
$200.

03:31.129 --> 03:32.629
Are the plaintiffs present?

03:32.631 --> 03:33.663
I will be representing

03:33.665 --> 03:34.897
the plaintiffs, Your Honor.

03:34.899 --> 03:37.166
The defendants?
Uh, yes, Your Honor.

03:37.168 --> 03:40.403
And I just, uh, wanted to say
I'm very excited

03:40.405 --> 03:42.672
to be here.
I do estate law,

03:42.674 --> 03:44.841
and this is my first
actual trial.

03:44.843 --> 03:47.944
Uh, Your Honor, and if I may,
uh, Charlie Kelly, cocounsel.

03:47.946 --> 03:49.979
Uh, background
in bird law, uh...

03:49.981 --> 03:53.316
Nephew.
Yeah. But excited to be,
uh, in the people's court

03:53.318 --> 03:54.651
a-and a big fan
of black judges,

03:54.653 --> 03:56.319
too.
Stop touching me.

03:56.321 --> 03:59.422
Okay. Look.

03:59.424 --> 04:01.791
All I need are the facts
to this case.

04:01.793 --> 04:03.760
I have a very long
day ahead of me,

04:03.762 --> 04:07.497
so I'm gonna need
to keep this thing moving.

04:07.499 --> 04:09.632
Are you gonna
bang the, uh...
Yeah, yeah.

04:09.634 --> 04:12.168
the-the hammer?
Do we...? Is there a...?

04:12.170 --> 04:13.670
Here we go?

04:14.673 --> 04:16.172
Hey.
(chuckles)
That's the...

04:16.174 --> 04:17.440
Awesome.
Yeah.

04:17.442 --> 04:19.042
It's cool, right?
Yeah, nice.

04:19.044 --> 04:21.377
LAWYER:
<i> Your Honor,</i>

04:21.379 --> 04:24.814
Friday the 13th
was a night of chaos.

04:24.816 --> 04:26.215
Milk,

04:26.217 --> 04:28.885
spiked with bath salts
by this man,

04:28.887 --> 04:31.054
Bill Ponderosa,

04:31.056 --> 04:33.489
was served
to the wedding guests.

04:33.491 --> 04:36.059
Now, my client is odd.

04:36.061 --> 04:39.062
You might even
refer to his family as...

04:40.999 --> 04:42.832
...very creepy.

04:42.834 --> 04:44.867
But they are saints
compared

04:44.869 --> 04:46.502
to Bill Ponderosa

04:46.504 --> 04:49.038
and the sordid lot
of degenerates

04:49.040 --> 04:50.973
he associates with.

04:50.975 --> 04:53.810
Terrible people who ruin lives.

04:53.812 --> 04:56.479
Ruined mine,
cost my client his marriage,

04:56.481 --> 04:59.649
ruined my first,
now my second one is teetering.

05:00.585 --> 05:02.251
You know what...

05:02.253 --> 05:03.853
I'm gonna sit down.

05:03.855 --> 05:05.354
I'm done.

05:05.356 --> 05:08.057
They just do this to me, okay?

05:08.059 --> 05:10.159
You get the point.

05:10.161 --> 05:11.994
UNCLE JACK:
Uh, Your Honor, I'll-I'll, uh,

05:11.996 --> 05:13.396
I'll keep it brief.

05:13.398 --> 05:16.099
I just have three things to say.

05:16.101 --> 05:18.901
Uh, one:

05:18.903 --> 05:22.572
Liam McPoyle
has a history of lying.

05:22.574 --> 05:25.274
Two: My client
is a loving

05:25.276 --> 05:27.844
family man.

05:27.846 --> 05:30.046
And three:

05:30.048 --> 05:32.415
He is innocent.

05:36.054 --> 05:38.054
<i> Deandra Reynolds,</i>

05:38.056 --> 05:40.456
you were the one that
told the police that Bill had

05:40.458 --> 05:43.226
spiked the punch
with bath salts.
That's correct.

05:43.228 --> 05:45.294
But you didn't actually
see him do it, did you?

05:45.296 --> 05:48.197
No, I did not.
So is it possible that,

05:48.199 --> 05:51.367
given the traumatic nature
of the evening,

05:51.369 --> 05:53.569
that you don't
remember the evening

05:53.571 --> 05:55.571
all that well?
Yes, that's correct.

05:55.573 --> 05:57.540
My car was destroyed and I
was locked into a freezer.

05:57.542 --> 05:59.208
My memory was
clouded by rage,

05:59.210 --> 06:01.110
and so I misremembered
the incident.

06:01.112 --> 06:04.714
An understandable mistake.
Could happen to any one of us.

06:04.716 --> 06:07.550
For example,
you remember me, possibly,

06:07.552 --> 06:09.786
as a man with small hands.

06:09.788 --> 06:11.387
Yeah, you think...

06:11.389 --> 06:13.456
What...
you think,
"He had small hands."

06:13.458 --> 06:14.557
Do you remember that?

06:14.559 --> 06:15.758
Yeah, sure, okay.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.227
What you remember is false.

06:18.229 --> 06:19.328
O-Okay.
Yup.

06:19.330 --> 06:21.297
Big, masculine.

06:21.299 --> 06:23.733
My hands tell a story

06:23.735 --> 06:25.735
of greatness.

06:25.737 --> 06:28.171
And when you look
at my right hand...
MELVOY: I'm gonna st...

06:28.173 --> 06:30.006
uh, uh, I'm gonna stop you

06:30.008 --> 06:31.307
right now.
Are you just gonna

06:31.309 --> 06:33.075
talk about your hands
for a while?

06:33.077 --> 06:35.278
Uh, no, Your Honor.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.080
No more questions
for the witness.

06:38.082 --> 06:39.816
(sighs)
Deandra,

06:39.818 --> 06:42.151
here is the statement
that you gave

06:42.153 --> 06:43.452
to police.

06:43.454 --> 06:45.288
"Bill did it.
That goddamn drug addict

06:45.290 --> 06:47.523
"is out of his mind.
I'll testify to that.

06:47.525 --> 06:49.792
"I swear on my mother's
grave that Bill spiked

06:49.794 --> 06:51.460
"that milk, no doubt about it.

06:51.462 --> 06:53.963
He's guilty, guilty, guilty."

06:53.965 --> 06:55.364
DEE:
Uh...

06:55.366 --> 06:56.532
Have you ever had sex

06:56.534 --> 06:58.935
with Bill before?

06:58.937 --> 07:00.436
Yeah.

07:00.438 --> 07:02.038
Yes, sure.
Because we-we were...

07:02.040 --> 07:04.040
We had a... We were sort of...

07:04.042 --> 07:05.608
We were lovers for a little...

07:05.610 --> 07:07.476
One of his prostitutes, right.

07:07.478 --> 07:08.978
Prostitutes?

07:08.980 --> 07:13.115
Um, I have a receipt
for a mink coat,

07:13.117 --> 07:14.784
recently purchased
by a Bill Ponderosa

07:14.786 --> 07:18.788
to be delivered
to a Dee Reynolds.

07:18.790 --> 07:20.723
A gift?

07:20.725 --> 07:23.159
Yes. I had a birthday.

07:23.161 --> 07:24.293
Six months ago.

07:24.295 --> 07:25.528
Uh...
Are you aware

07:25.530 --> 07:27.029
that the coat was purchased

07:27.031 --> 07:30.066
at Doyle McPoyle's
Trappings and Fur?

07:30.068 --> 07:31.334
No.
Or that the coat

07:31.336 --> 07:32.902
was not made of mink at all

07:32.904 --> 07:35.338
but rather made of... muskrat?

07:35.340 --> 07:38.407
Muskrat? Goddamn muskrat?
Are you kidding me,

07:38.409 --> 07:40.743
Bill? Okay, you know
what, fine, he spiked it.

07:40.745 --> 07:43.546
(murmuring)
I'm sorry. What did you say?

07:43.548 --> 07:45.414
He spiked it and then
he tried to bribe me.

07:45.416 --> 07:47.483
(groaning)

07:47.485 --> 07:49.652
No further questions,
Your Honor.

07:49.654 --> 07:52.889
Ma'am, do you know
what perjury is?

07:52.891 --> 07:55.157
Mm-hmm.

07:55.159 --> 07:56.993
CHARLIE:
<i> Oh, this is terrible.</i>

07:56.995 --> 07:58.494
Well, he shouldn't be ...
This is terrible.

07:58.496 --> 08:00.062
Wow, you guys are getting
crushed in there.

08:00.064 --> 08:01.898
Yeah. Oh, I know.
Hey, thanks, Mac. Hi. Great.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.033
Hey, you know, I feel like
I'm not being utilized properly.

08:04.035 --> 08:05.368
Well, that's 'cause
you don't have anything.

08:05.370 --> 08:06.903
So you're not being
utilized at all.

08:06.905 --> 08:08.905
Yeah, but what if I get
to deliver the bombshell?

08:08.907 --> 08:11.574
Oh.
What bombshell?

08:11.576 --> 08:14.010
You guys don't have
a bombshell? Oh, my God.

08:14.012 --> 08:16.045
Every good case
needs a bombshell.

08:16.047 --> 08:17.680
Oh, Jesus Christ,
and, without it,

08:17.682 --> 08:20.049
you're screwed. You know
what, you know what?
Okay.

08:20.051 --> 08:22.051
I'll find one for you. I'm
gonna do, like, a hero cop,

08:22.053 --> 08:23.619
Mark Fuhrman thing...
Oh, Mark Furhman.
No...

08:23.621 --> 08:24.854
and then sort of transition
into a Kato Kaelin.

08:24.856 --> 08:26.622
Yeah, I wish you
would do none of it.

08:26.624 --> 08:28.024
Okay. All right. Cool.
I wish you'd do none of it, man.

08:28.026 --> 08:29.458
I'm on it, I'm on it.
Shit.
Okay. All right.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.527
Ah, why can't people
just stay out of this?

08:31.529 --> 08:33.429
Yeah, look,
there's potentially...
That-That's my bird expert.

08:33.431 --> 08:36.032
He's from Penn. The guy... Like,
he's totally official, okay?

08:36.034 --> 08:38.367
Let me do the bird thing.
He's an ornithologist.
I don't think it's a good...

08:38.369 --> 08:39.902
I'm gonna kill, man.
I know, but, Charlie,
I'm just...

08:39.904 --> 08:41.203
Uncle Jack, put me
back on the stand.
What?

08:41.205 --> 08:42.805
No, we cannot.
Are you kidding me?

08:42.807 --> 08:44.273
You're lucky you didn't
get sent to jail.

08:44.275 --> 08:45.808
Yeah, I know.
But I think this could work.

08:45.810 --> 08:47.376
I'm gonna say
I found some bullshit online

08:47.378 --> 08:50.479
that proves
that lawyer's Jewish.
Oh.

08:50.481 --> 08:53.149
So what?
So what?
He'll be a laughingstock.

08:53.151 --> 08:55.384
(laughs)
Yes. Yes.
Right?

08:55.386 --> 08:57.153
Because the man is Jewish?

08:59.090 --> 09:01.824
No. What? No.
Not because he's...
Well, that's what

09:01.826 --> 09:04.293
it sounds like you're saying.
N-Not because he's Jewish.
Because he's a liar

09:04.295 --> 09:06.062
and because he's embarrassed
about being Jewish.

09:06.064 --> 09:07.396
I mean, what is that?

09:07.398 --> 09:09.065
Dee, you blew it.
Like, big-time.

09:09.067 --> 09:11.067
I wish you guys would just stay
out of this.

09:11.069 --> 09:12.568
I-I didn't... I-I...
(groans)

09:17.508 --> 09:20.509
Maureen, you are the sister
of Bill Ponderosa,

09:20.511 --> 09:23.479
and it was at your wedding
that Liam got attacked?

09:23.481 --> 09:25.781
Meow.
Mmm.

09:25.783 --> 09:29.185
Your Honor, nothing represents
the tragic aftermath

09:29.187 --> 09:32.288
more than the dramatic
transformation of this woman...

09:32.290 --> 09:34.991
Uh, cat.
Excuse me?

09:34.993 --> 09:36.659
As I transition
from woman to cat,

09:36.661 --> 09:40.429
I must insist on being
referred to as a cat.

09:40.431 --> 09:42.865
Objection.
She's not a cat, Your Honor.

09:42.867 --> 09:45.134
(hisses)
(gallery gasping)

09:45.136 --> 09:47.470
If the witness wants to consider
herself a cat, I will allow it.

09:47.472 --> 09:49.338
I just need to know
where all this is headed.

09:49.340 --> 09:50.973
How is this relevant?

09:50.975 --> 09:52.608
Well, it's clearly relevant

09:52.610 --> 09:54.710
the attack had
a psychological impact

09:54.712 --> 09:57.513
on all the parties
that evening.

09:57.515 --> 09:59.682
No further questions.

09:59.684 --> 10:03.119
Y-Your Honor, do you see what's
going on here? This is crazy.

10:03.121 --> 10:06.188
You know what, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna approach the bench.
No.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.457
Can I just approach it
real fast?
Absolutely not.

10:08.459 --> 10:11.193
All right, earlier, you-you
referred to my ex-wife as a cat,

10:11.195 --> 10:14.196
per her request. Uh, now,
surely, you wouldn't force a man

10:14.198 --> 10:16.198
to pay alimony to a cat, right?

10:16.200 --> 10:19.301
So motion to establish me not
having to pay alimony anymore.

10:19.303 --> 10:21.837
I will not allow that.
Okay, well, so can we just...
we'll pop it on the docket?

10:21.839 --> 10:23.806
We can put it at the end
of the day if you want.

10:23.808 --> 10:25.908
I just want to clear it up
while I got her in a courtroom.

10:25.910 --> 10:28.377
I will not allow that, either.
Sit down.

10:28.379 --> 10:30.379
Now you don't allow something.
Now you don't allow something!

10:30.381 --> 10:32.481
Allow all this.
You gonna allow that?

10:32.483 --> 10:36.185
You know? But you don't...
Okay, I'm good. Goddamn it.

10:36.187 --> 10:37.753
UNCLE JACK:
<i> Frank,</i>

10:37.755 --> 10:40.089
did you go to the wedding?
I did.

10:40.091 --> 10:42.892
And I snuck Ryan up in
the trunk of my car.

10:42.894 --> 10:46.395
He hadn't been invited to
the wedding, on account
of the beef with Liam.

10:46.397 --> 10:49.265
And I had him in the trunk
of the car, on account of I
didn't want to sit with him

10:49.267 --> 10:50.699
'cause he's gross.
Right.

10:50.701 --> 10:53.436
(chuckles)
And, uh, uh,

10:53.438 --> 10:56.939
what did Ryan say to you
when you got to the wedding?

10:56.941 --> 10:59.341
"I'm gonna kill
Maureen Ponderosa."

10:59.343 --> 11:03.679
So, if there's someone to point
the finger at, it would be...

11:03.681 --> 11:05.881
his brother!
(gallery gasping)

11:05.883 --> 11:09.285
Oh, my God! Oh, my
God, nobody look!

11:09.287 --> 11:11.720
Nobody look! Nobody look!

11:11.722 --> 11:14.290
Nobody look!
Nobody look!

11:14.292 --> 11:15.958
Nobody look!

11:17.395 --> 11:18.861
Now, you've stabbed

11:18.863 --> 11:20.629
your brother before, correct?

11:20.631 --> 11:22.398
Oh, sure.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.899
And you were upset
at the wedding.

11:23.901 --> 11:27.736
So it's not crazy
for me to ask you this.

11:27.738 --> 11:31.307
Ryan McPoyle, did you attack
your brother at the wedding?

11:31.309 --> 11:34.577
Oh. I'm not Ryan.

11:34.579 --> 11:37.646
What, you're not?
Nope.

11:37.648 --> 11:40.649
I'm Lion. Like the animal.

11:40.651 --> 11:42.218
Lion McPoyle.

11:42.220 --> 11:44.386
Wh-Why are you on the stand?

11:44.388 --> 11:45.988
Because you said "his brother"

11:45.990 --> 11:48.090
and threw your big fake hand
at me.

11:48.092 --> 11:50.659
O-Okay.
Ryan's at home with Liam,
taking care of his infected eye.

11:50.661 --> 11:52.294
Okay, uh, uh, boy, let's, uh,

11:52.296 --> 11:55.297
str-strike that, uh,
hand comment from the record.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.733
Uh, would you happen to know

11:57.735 --> 11:59.902
if Ryan stabbed his brother
in the eye?

11:59.904 --> 12:01.804
Oh, yeah. I know.
He totally did it.

12:01.806 --> 12:03.906
(gallery murmuring)
Well, then I guess

12:03.908 --> 12:06.442
we will never know,
ladies and gentlemen.

12:06.444 --> 12:08.177
Uncle Jack,
he just confessed!

12:08.179 --> 12:09.812
He did?
Yes!

12:09.814 --> 12:12.081
Yeah, Ryan stabbed Liam.
I totally saw it.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.983
Oh, my God! We won!

12:13.985 --> 12:15.251
(light cheering and applause)

12:15.253 --> 12:16.285
We-- you did it.

12:16.287 --> 12:18.187
We did it.
How did I do it?

12:18.189 --> 12:21.090
Lion, was Ryan drinking milk
at the wedding?

12:21.092 --> 12:22.791
Of course. Everyone was.

12:22.793 --> 12:26.128
So who did the stabbing
doesn't matter, Your Honor,

12:26.130 --> 12:28.164
because they were all
still drugged

12:28.166 --> 12:31.167
on Bill Ponderosa's spiked milk,

12:31.169 --> 12:34.270
which is the point I've been
trying to make the entire time.

12:34.272 --> 12:37.873
So just to be clear,
you've proven my case.

12:37.875 --> 12:40.042
You lose.

12:40.044 --> 12:43.479
(gallery groaning)
(sighs)
I can't follow any of this.

12:43.481 --> 12:46.649
What?
Guys, I got it.

12:46.651 --> 12:48.284
You-you got what?

12:48.286 --> 12:50.786
I got the bombshell.

12:50.788 --> 12:52.788
UNCLE JACK:
<i> Okay, Mr. McDonald,</i>

12:52.790 --> 12:56.458
you recently found out some
very interesting information.

12:56.460 --> 12:58.627
Care to share it with the court?

12:58.629 --> 13:00.963
Yes. I've recently been informed

13:00.965 --> 13:05.367
that Ryan McPoyle
only drinks mother's milk!

13:05.369 --> 13:07.469
(gallery gasping, murmuring)
Which means there's no way

13:07.471 --> 13:10.539
he could have drank the
milk that Bill spiked,

13:10.541 --> 13:13.142
which means he was sober
when he attacked his brother,

13:13.144 --> 13:14.877
which means Bill is innocent!

13:14.879 --> 13:17.513
Case closed! Kaboom!

13:17.515 --> 13:19.582
Bombshell!

13:19.584 --> 13:21.050
(laughs)

13:21.052 --> 13:22.751
I did it. I did it,
black judge. I did it.

13:22.753 --> 13:25.688
Mr.... Mr. McDonald, how did you
come upon this information?

13:25.690 --> 13:28.324
Oh, I banged Margaret McPoyle.
I'm curious

13:28.326 --> 13:31.594
how she told you,
because Margaret is a mute.

13:31.596 --> 13:35.097
Well, guess what, smart guy,
I had her write it down.

13:35.099 --> 13:40.069
One more thing, Your Honor.
Margaret, you carry a picture

13:40.071 --> 13:42.504
of Mother with you at
all times, don't you?

13:42.506 --> 13:44.640
Do you mind showing
that to the court?

13:48.079 --> 13:50.312
(gallery gasping)

13:52.450 --> 13:54.049
LAWYER:
Your Honor,

13:54.051 --> 13:56.852
Mother is the name
of the McPoyle family cow.

13:56.854 --> 13:59.221
The cow that provided the milk
for the wedding.

13:59.223 --> 14:01.357
The milk that was drugged by...

14:01.359 --> 14:04.693
Bill Ponderosa.

14:04.695 --> 14:07.696
That mute bitch
lied to me for sex.

14:07.698 --> 14:09.431
Bombshell diffused.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.267
Abramowitz!
(gallery murmuring)

14:11.269 --> 14:15.037
Your great-grandmother's
last name was Abramowitz.

14:15.039 --> 14:16.939
I found it
on an ancestry Web site.

14:16.941 --> 14:23.379
That makes you a dirty liar
because you are Jewish.

14:23.381 --> 14:25.147
(gallery groaning and murmuring)

14:25.149 --> 14:27.549
Okay, I...
That came out kind of bad.

14:27.551 --> 14:29.885
I-I'm not disgusted
by the Jewish part.

14:29.887 --> 14:31.987
It's the... it's the<i> lying</i> part
that I was talking about.

14:31.989 --> 14:35.457
This dirty liar is a Jew...

14:35.459 --> 14:37.459
ish man.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.461
Recess?

14:39.463 --> 14:41.297
CHARLIE:
<i> Oh, God!</i>

14:41.299 --> 14:43.098
Oh, that stupid Dee.
All right, calm down, calm down.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.967
Look, as the great
Johnnie Cochran once said,

14:44.969 --> 14:46.802
if the glove
doesn't fit, give up.

14:46.804 --> 14:48.737
That's not what he
said! That's not...
It...

14:48.739 --> 14:50.239
How are you a
lawyer, Jack?
All right...

14:50.241 --> 14:52.174
I mean, I know more than
you. All right, look...

14:52.176 --> 14:53.976
Watch your voice.
Watch your voice.
Okay, okay, let's just...

14:53.978 --> 14:55.611
let me do my bird
thing. Okay, Bill,

14:55.613 --> 14:57.279
I want to do the bird thing.
Can we just do it...?

14:57.281 --> 14:58.847
Yeah, that's great. No,
let's do the bird thing.

14:58.849 --> 15:00.582
You're good
with it now? Okay.
Love it, yeah.

15:00.584 --> 15:02.818
Jesus, son, what'd
you cut this with?
Shut up, bitch.

15:02.820 --> 15:04.987
Son? Your... This is...
Your son is your dealer?

15:04.989 --> 15:06.322
He's reliable.

15:06.324 --> 15:08.123
Oh, God. Frank, what
are you doing, man?

15:08.125 --> 15:10.259
Come on, reign it in.
I paid for it.

15:10.261 --> 15:12.695
I'm gonna do it.
Hey, fat ass,
this asshole's short 30 bucks.

15:12.697 --> 15:14.997
Go steal another set of my
golf clubs, you piece of shit.

15:14.999 --> 15:17.032
(bleep) you.
Piss off.

15:17.034 --> 15:18.967
Guys, guys, we're doing
the bird theory, all right?
All right.

15:18.969 --> 15:21.003
All right.
All right. All right.
I'm taking the lead here, okay?

15:21.005 --> 15:22.771
Yeah.
All right, let's do it.
Birds on three.

15:22.773 --> 15:24.873
ALL:
One, two, three. Birds!
Those are just ridiculous, man.

15:24.875 --> 15:27.876
It's like three hands...
like eight hands out there.
Yeah.

15:27.878 --> 15:29.678
CHARLIE:
<i> Your Honor,</i>

15:29.680 --> 15:31.547
this is the McPoyle
family crest.

15:31.549 --> 15:34.116
On it you will find a bird--

15:34.118 --> 15:36.685
a Pocono swallow,
to be more accurate.

15:36.687 --> 15:38.387
A very rare,
very elusive bird.

15:38.389 --> 15:39.888
You'll notice
its trademark

15:39.890 --> 15:43.359
unibrow, highly uncommon
in most aviary circles.

15:43.361 --> 15:44.960
And my research shows

15:44.962 --> 15:47.963
that unlike your typical
North American barn swallow,

15:47.965 --> 15:50.866
the Pocono swallow, if kept
under the proper conditions,

15:50.868 --> 15:53.869
can live as long as 80
to even 85 years,

15:53.871 --> 15:55.571
much like a parrot

15:55.573 --> 15:58.073
or some of the more resilient
coastal gulls.

15:58.075 --> 16:00.909
Your Honor,
where is this going?

16:00.911 --> 16:04.546
I don't know, but it'd
better lead somewhere fast.

16:04.548 --> 16:05.914
Your Honor, I can assure you

16:05.916 --> 16:07.416
that this will be
our final argument.

16:07.418 --> 16:09.218
Well, if it's gonna help
end all of this madness,

16:09.220 --> 16:10.652
I'll allow it.

16:10.654 --> 16:12.020
Thank you, Your Honor.

16:12.022 --> 16:13.922
Now, there was another member

16:13.924 --> 16:15.758
of the McPoyle family clan
at the wedding

16:15.760 --> 16:17.226
the night of the incident.

16:17.228 --> 16:19.561
A member
that none of us have met.

16:19.563 --> 16:21.730
Certainly not anyone
on this side of the aisle.

16:21.732 --> 16:25.401
A one Mr. Royal McPoyle.

16:25.403 --> 16:28.504
A bird. The McPoyle family's

16:28.506 --> 16:31.240
pet Pocono swallow,
and my research shows

16:31.242 --> 16:32.775
that this particular
Pocono swallow

16:32.777 --> 16:35.110
has a history of violence.

16:35.112 --> 16:38.013
Look into the gallery, and
you will see Royal's victims.

16:38.015 --> 16:40.449
It took Margaret's
vocal cords in 1999,

16:40.451 --> 16:42.451
leaving her mute.

16:42.453 --> 16:44.453
Keith McPoyle lost his eyes
and his ears

16:44.455 --> 16:46.855
to it in '76,
and we all know

16:46.857 --> 16:49.291
that according to bird law,
it's three strikes,

16:49.293 --> 16:51.126
and you're out.

16:51.128 --> 16:53.629
Bye, bye, birdie.

16:53.631 --> 16:56.465
Ready, boys and girls, because
here's where it gets good.

16:56.467 --> 16:59.201
Ryan McPoyle didn't
attack Liam. Royal did.

16:59.203 --> 17:02.037
And Lion was<i> lying</i> about
Ryan attacking Liam

17:02.039 --> 17:03.639
to protect Royal
from the chair.

17:03.641 --> 17:05.207
Or lethal injection.

17:05.209 --> 17:07.042
Or perhaps some sort of
small bird guillotine.

17:07.044 --> 17:08.744
I wouldn't understand
the physics of it.

17:08.746 --> 17:10.479
I'm not an executioner.

17:10.481 --> 17:13.682
I'm just the best goddamn
bird lawyer in the world.

17:15.486 --> 17:17.653
So, bottom line-- and
listen up, numbnuts,

17:17.655 --> 17:20.556
'cause it blows a
hole in your case--

17:20.558 --> 17:23.425
birds don't drink milk.

17:23.427 --> 17:25.127
Objection, Your Honor.
(gallery groaning)

17:25.129 --> 17:27.763
There's no Royal McPoyle.

17:27.765 --> 17:30.899
Perhaps, or perhaps not.

17:30.901 --> 17:35.170
Your Honor, I call Pappy McPoyle
to the stand.

17:35.172 --> 17:39.141
Pappy McPoyle, patriarch
of the McPoyle family.

17:39.143 --> 17:42.678
Royal was your pet bird. You've
had him since you were a boy.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.581
And isn't it true that you never
go anywhere without him?

17:45.583 --> 17:47.316
(crying):
Yeah. Yeah.

17:47.318 --> 17:49.284
I have seen...

17:49.286 --> 17:51.620
raccoons and oysters dancing...

17:51.622 --> 17:53.822
in the head of a pin
with the angels.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.524
They are laughing.

17:55.526 --> 17:57.192
LAWYER:
All right, Your Honor,

17:57.194 --> 17:59.428
clearly, this witness
is mentally unwell

17:59.430 --> 18:01.997
and cannot answer any
of the questions properly...

18:01.999 --> 18:04.633
Uh, perhaps, Your Honor,
or-or perhaps it's just a cover.

18:04.635 --> 18:06.335
But it's quite all right.

18:06.337 --> 18:08.337
I don't have
any further questions.

18:08.339 --> 18:10.305
Oh, except one more.

18:10.307 --> 18:14.343
Didn't the bailiff ask everyone
to remove their hats?

18:15.613 --> 18:16.845
That is true.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.547
Mr. McPoyle,

18:18.549 --> 18:20.616
would you please
remove your hat?

18:20.618 --> 18:24.386
Hmm...
Mr. McPoyle,
please remove your hat.

18:24.388 --> 18:26.955
Perhaps he is too insane
to understand the question.

18:26.957 --> 18:29.391
Why don't I just...?

18:29.393 --> 18:31.527
(squawk)

18:31.529 --> 18:33.862
(gallery groans, gasps, shouts)

18:33.864 --> 18:36.131
Ladies and gentlemen,
Royal McPoyle.

18:36.133 --> 18:37.399
(squawks)

18:37.401 --> 18:38.800
Chickadee, dee, dee,
little birdie.

18:38.802 --> 18:40.202
Let's dance.

18:40.204 --> 18:42.070
Your Honor, this is
Mr. Belka Maier.

18:42.072 --> 18:44.206
He's a professor of ornithology
at the University of Penn.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.707
Mr. Maier, it's
safe to say

18:45.709 --> 18:47.643
you're a bit of an
expert on birds, yes?

18:47.645 --> 18:49.378
I believe you're correct.

18:49.380 --> 18:51.380
And you would understand this
Pocono swallow quite well,

18:51.382 --> 18:52.881
wouldn't you?
Yes, I do.

18:52.883 --> 18:55.250
Then please ask it
if it attacked Liam!

18:55.252 --> 18:57.853
Ask... if... What?

18:57.855 --> 18:59.655
CHARLIE: Mr. Maier, I would
like you to please talk

18:59.657 --> 19:02.925
to the bird and say, "Did
you attack Liam McPoyle?!"

19:02.927 --> 19:06.228
(laughing):
I can't converse with...
with a bird.

19:06.230 --> 19:08.997
Well, I thought you
were an expert on birds.
I am an expert on birds, but...

19:08.999 --> 19:10.899
Well, I need you to
communicate with the bird.

19:10.901 --> 19:12.935
This is very important,
and I need to...
MAIER: But it's a...

19:12.937 --> 19:14.403
(laughs)

19:14.405 --> 19:16.171
Well, this is
a bit embarrassing, Your Honor.

19:16.173 --> 19:18.006
Perhaps this man
has lied about his credentials.

19:18.008 --> 19:21.543
Uh, fortunately, I am familiar
with a little bit of pigeon.

19:21.545 --> 19:24.746
Perhaps I can
get through to it in some way.

19:24.748 --> 19:27.215
(cooing)

19:27.217 --> 19:28.750
LAWYER:
Okay.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.419
Your Honor, this is nonsense.

19:30.421 --> 19:32.554
Look, kitty.
(mews)

19:32.556 --> 19:34.556
Yeah, kitty.
Chase the laser beam, kitty.
(gallery gasping and murmuring)

19:34.558 --> 19:36.625
Order.
Your Honor, you've got
a man speaking to a bird.

19:36.627 --> 19:38.560
And yet, you refuse to rule

19:38.562 --> 19:41.129
on me having
to pay alimony to this cat.

19:41.131 --> 19:42.564
What is this?!
Order!

19:42.566 --> 19:43.732
It's a mockery of
justice, Your Honor.

19:43.734 --> 19:45.801
This is ridiculous, and this...

19:45.803 --> 19:49.037
I said, order!
(gallery clamoring)

19:49.039 --> 19:50.973
LAWYER:
He's talking to the pigeon!

19:50.975 --> 19:53.075
I'm not paying alimony
to a goddamn cat!

19:53.077 --> 19:55.544
Order!
I want order in this court!

19:55.546 --> 19:57.112
Fly, my pet!

19:57.114 --> 19:58.480
Fly!

19:58.482 --> 20:00.449
(bird squawking,
people screaming)

20:00.451 --> 20:02.317
Bring me their eyes!

20:02.319 --> 20:04.052
(laughing)

20:04.054 --> 20:07.322
(screaming, shouting)

20:07.324 --> 20:08.657
Bring them to me!

20:08.659 --> 20:09.658
(laughing)

20:09.660 --> 20:10.726
Oh!

20:10.728 --> 20:12.694
(clamoring)

20:19.937 --> 20:21.603
MELVOY:
In my 35 years on this bench,
I have never seen

20:21.605 --> 20:23.405
such a mockery made
of this courtroom.

20:23.407 --> 20:26.908
You people have wasted my time,

20:26.910 --> 20:28.744
you've wasted
the taxpayers' time,

20:28.746 --> 20:31.813
and this justice
has heard enough.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.248
I am throwing this case out.

20:33.250 --> 20:34.750
I should've
done it hours ago.

20:34.752 --> 20:36.084
He's throwing it out!
That means we win!

20:36.086 --> 20:37.619
That means we win!
That means we won!

20:37.621 --> 20:40.155
Damn, damn, damn!

20:40.157 --> 20:41.690
Order.

20:41.692 --> 20:44.359
Eat that!
Damn it!

20:44.361 --> 20:45.360
Order!

20:45.362 --> 20:47.763
This court has ruled.

20:47.765 --> 20:49.665
Now, I suggest

20:49.667 --> 20:51.667
that you people get
the hell out of my courtroom

20:51.669 --> 20:53.435
before I put you all in jail.

20:53.437 --> 20:54.870
You got it!
Get out!

20:54.872 --> 20:56.772
Bailiff, next case.

20:56.774 --> 20:59.141
Ridiculous.

20:59.143 --> 21:00.776
We have<i> Morgan State Delivery</i>

21:00.778 --> 21:03.145
<i> v. the proprietors</i>
<i> of one Paddy's Pub.</i>

21:03.147 --> 21:06.148
Oh! That's us. Yeah,
that's us, Your Honor.
Oh, that's us. Oh!

21:06.150 --> 21:08.050
Oh, hell no! Uh-uh.

21:08.052 --> 21:09.718
All right.
Uh-uh!

21:45.823 --> 21:47.222
(trumpet playing off-key)

21:47.224 --> 21:48.724
<i> Brown.</i>
