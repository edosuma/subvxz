00:33.144 --> 00:34.578
Listen, rookie, you're new,

00:34.646 --> 00:36.263
so you'll be
intimidated at first.

00:36.314 --> 00:38.015
When I started,

00:38.099 --> 00:40.133
I was afraid to ask
where the bathroom was.

00:40.185 --> 00:42.019
I pooped in my drawer
for six months.

00:42.103 --> 00:43.654
Started planting things in it.

00:43.738 --> 00:44.989
My tomatoes did really well.

00:46.825 --> 00:48.776
The only way to get
ahead is to work hard.

00:48.827 --> 00:51.762
Just keep your nose to the
grindstone... oh, my God!

00:53.231 --> 00:54.765
It's Senator Buckingham!

00:54.833 --> 00:56.217
Stop pointing.

00:56.284 --> 00:57.735
He's the Senator who assigns

00:57.802 --> 01:00.454
all the prestigious CIA
Task Force positions.

01:00.522 --> 01:01.956
Quick, look like
you're working hard.

01:05.143 --> 01:06.377
Don't stand there
looking stupid,

01:06.461 --> 01:07.828
start stacking the wood!

01:07.879 --> 01:09.580
Webber, you son of a gun!

01:09.648 --> 01:12.082
Still playing your short irons
in the front of your stance?

01:12.150 --> 01:13.567
It works for me.

01:13.635 --> 01:16.620
I made a tricky up and down
past the trap on nine last week.

01:16.688 --> 01:18.338
They got you
setting up shop here?

01:18.390 --> 01:19.673
No, no.

01:19.741 --> 01:21.575
I'm taking you up to eight.

01:21.643 --> 01:23.711
Got a primo task force position
for you.

01:23.778 --> 01:25.212
Geez, sir, that would be great!

01:29.017 --> 01:30.901
See how busy I look?

01:32.120 --> 01:34.221
I don't fudging believe it!

01:34.289 --> 01:37.191
Senator Buckingham just took
Webber to the eighth floor!

01:37.259 --> 01:39.443
Why did the senator just
promote the new guy?

01:39.511 --> 01:41.345
Stan, they're golf buddies.

01:41.413 --> 01:42.463
Golf?!

01:42.530 --> 01:43.864
But I've been here 20 years!

01:43.932 --> 01:45.149
I've focused
totally on the work!

01:45.216 --> 01:46.333
I've never made waves...

01:46.384 --> 01:47.801
That's exactly right!

01:47.869 --> 01:49.203
You haven't made waves.

01:49.271 --> 01:51.538
But people like waves.

01:51.606 --> 01:52.940
Waves are fun.

01:53.008 --> 01:54.875
Remember in <i>Fast Times</i>

01:54.943 --> 01:57.678
how Spicoli is always
after "tasty waves"?

01:57.746 --> 01:59.179
I've never seen that movie.

01:59.247 --> 02:01.348
Well, no wonder you don't
understand the business world.

02:01.416 --> 02:03.584
<i>Teishi!</i>

02:03.652 --> 02:07.588
There's no birthday party
for me in here.

02:09.624 --> 02:12.626
She's seen <i>Fast Times.</i>

02:12.694 --> 02:14.495
It's like this, Stan.

02:14.562 --> 02:16.230
You can either play
the career game,

02:16.298 --> 02:18.565
or you can concentrate
on family.

02:18.633 --> 02:21.669
I'm not saying
career is better than family.

02:21.736 --> 02:24.038
It's just a choice.

02:24.105 --> 02:26.707
Career's better.

02:26.775 --> 02:29.576
This is all the towel I need.

02:32.847 --> 02:34.848
Hey-Dee, hi-Dee.
What's up? Not much.

02:34.916 --> 02:37.568
Just doing some work on
the school, some improvements.

02:37.636 --> 02:39.753
Gosh, in those weird suits?

02:39.804 --> 02:41.372
Is it dangerous?

02:41.439 --> 02:43.223
Legally, I have to say "yes."

02:43.291 --> 02:45.392
But personally,
I don't think it's a problem.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.011
How could asbestos hurt you?

02:47.078 --> 02:48.612
It's got "best" right in it.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.364
I got a tear in my suit!

02:50.432 --> 02:51.598
I've been exposed!

02:51.650 --> 02:52.616
Don't touch me!

02:52.684 --> 02:54.351
No reason we both got to die!

02:54.419 --> 02:56.086
Steve, get in the car.

02:56.154 --> 02:57.087
'Kay, mommy.

02:57.155 --> 02:58.038
Hey! Oh, God!

03:03.128 --> 03:05.129
I work and I work,
and I get nowhere.

03:05.196 --> 03:06.930
My only option
is to take 20 grand

03:06.998 --> 03:08.565
over to the golf club
and join up.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.334
You can't take up golf.

03:10.402 --> 03:13.470
We need that money
to send Steve to private school.

03:13.538 --> 03:16.306
We can't leave him where he is.
It's full of poisons!

03:16.374 --> 03:17.508
Can you guys keep it down?

03:17.575 --> 03:19.143
I'm studying
for my nursing exam.

03:19.210 --> 03:21.845
Bertrum, I have some bad news.

03:21.913 --> 03:24.314
The test results
came back and...

03:24.382 --> 03:26.383
Looks like
you're dying of cuteness.

03:27.919 --> 03:29.453
Look, I'm sorry,
but I can't afford

03:29.521 --> 03:32.623
to once again fall into the trap
of choosing family over career.

03:32.691 --> 03:34.224
I don't think it's a trap.

03:34.292 --> 03:36.994
No? Try sitting
in a cubicle for 20 years.

03:37.078 --> 03:38.629
Did you know
that the average cubicle

03:38.697 --> 03:40.330
is half the size
of a prison cell?

03:40.398 --> 03:41.498
But you get to leave.

03:41.566 --> 03:43.017
And come home.

03:43.084 --> 03:45.669
You, you walked
right into that one, babe.

03:45.737 --> 03:48.772
Well, I already signed us up
to tour the private school.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.175
Fine, but I'm not gonna
try to impress anyone.

03:51.242 --> 03:52.676
No jokes, no charm,

03:52.761 --> 03:54.161
and I'm gonna wear
the pj bottoms

03:54.229 --> 03:55.863
where my pud always falls out.

03:58.666 --> 04:00.567
Look at that designer backpack.

04:00.635 --> 04:02.853
And check out
that $200 haircut.

04:02.921 --> 04:04.154
What a waste.

04:04.222 --> 04:06.223
That money could cover
a whole Iraqi family

04:06.291 --> 04:07.591
in white phosphorus.

04:07.659 --> 04:09.893
And this kid in his
fancy electric scooter.

04:09.961 --> 04:11.495
Too spoiled to walk.

04:11.563 --> 04:13.230
Good afternoon.

04:13.298 --> 04:15.999
Jerk's got his stereo
attached to his scooter.

04:16.067 --> 04:18.601
When I was young, I had
to carry mine on my shoulder.

04:18.670 --> 04:20.504
There is no way
we're sending Steve here

04:20.572 --> 04:23.373
to hobnob with Jimmy Boom Box
and his silver spoon pals.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:34.936 --> 04:36.270
Yep, Steve should go here.

04:36.337 --> 04:37.938
But you just said...
I changed my mind.

04:38.006 --> 04:39.673
It's called a 180, Francine.

04:43.378 --> 04:44.244
It's a crow!

04:44.312 --> 04:46.230
Francine, get the camera.

04:50.585 --> 04:52.319
Why do I have to wear
this stupid uniform

04:52.387 --> 04:53.587
and go to a new school?

04:53.655 --> 04:54.788
You just have to go here

04:54.856 --> 04:56.240
until I can get in good
with the senator

04:56.307 --> 04:57.641
and get that promotion.

05:14.843 --> 05:16.844
Hey, you seen a limo
with diplomatic plates?

05:16.911 --> 05:18.078
No.

05:18.146 --> 05:19.546
Have you ever
seen a magic trick

05:19.614 --> 05:20.948
so amazing it'll
blow your mind?

05:22.417 --> 05:23.817
Yoo-hoo!

05:31.309 --> 05:33.043
Beat it, you dingus.

05:36.214 --> 05:38.031
Senator!

05:38.099 --> 05:39.666
It's Stan Smith from the CIA.

05:39.734 --> 05:40.767
My son goes here.

05:40.835 --> 05:42.469
I don't recognize the face.

05:42.537 --> 05:43.937
Well, that's because
you haven't seen me

05:44.005 --> 05:45.439
putt my driver and make holes.

05:45.507 --> 05:46.440
Sorry?

05:46.508 --> 05:47.674
Yeah, just golf talk.

05:47.742 --> 05:49.443
Or a golf joke,
if it doesn't seem right.

05:50.879 --> 05:52.212
That's good stuff.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.748
Hey, how about me and you
play some golf tomorrow?

05:54.816 --> 05:56.817
Hmm. I got to be at work.

05:56.885 --> 05:57.918
Hey, you know where

05:57.986 --> 05:59.469
all the real work gets done,
don't you?

05:59.554 --> 06:00.737
Oh, yeah.

06:00.805 --> 06:01.705
Do I ever!

06:03.208 --> 06:04.208
Okay!

06:04.275 --> 06:05.859
See you tomorrow.

06:09.831 --> 06:12.032
He means the work gets
done on the golf course.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.450
Shut up, dingus!

06:15.019 --> 06:16.703
Dingus! Dingus.

06:16.771 --> 06:18.539
Thank you.

06:23.995 --> 06:25.996
I think that's enough, Stan.

06:26.064 --> 06:28.198
Oh, excuse me,
Mr. Grindstone.

06:28.266 --> 06:30.133
This report is due
tomorrow, okay?!

06:30.201 --> 06:32.669
Tomorrow...
Oh, that reminds me.

06:32.737 --> 06:35.005
Tomorrow I'm playing golf
with senator Buckingham.

06:36.207 --> 06:38.108
At his golf club.

06:38.176 --> 06:41.044
The same one
Brooke Hogan belongs to.

06:41.112 --> 06:44.781
Her father is Paul Hogan,
professional golfer,

06:44.849 --> 06:47.117
brother of Hulk Hogan.

06:47.185 --> 06:49.052
I don't think
any of that's right.

06:50.121 --> 06:51.088
Yello.

06:51.155 --> 06:52.589
Hey, baby.

06:52.657 --> 06:54.258
He wasn't in school?!

06:54.325 --> 06:55.359
No, don't.

06:55.426 --> 06:56.593
I'll set him straight.

06:56.661 --> 06:59.229
Straighter than Chuck Norris.

06:59.297 --> 07:01.832
Because, he's
so obviously hetero.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.383
Well, um,
m-maybe it'd be funnier

07:03.451 --> 07:05.586
if you were looking at his face,
like I am.

07:11.292 --> 07:12.276
Hi, mom.

07:12.343 --> 07:14.011
I'm not supposed
to talk to you.

07:14.078 --> 07:15.145
Oh? Why is that?

07:15.213 --> 07:16.980
Because your dad
is going to talk to you

07:17.048 --> 07:18.098
when he gets home.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.416
Oh? Why is that?

07:19.484 --> 07:21.385
School called.

07:22.303 --> 07:23.186
You!

07:24.872 --> 07:26.556
Ooh!

07:44.325 --> 07:45.742
Stan!

07:45.810 --> 07:47.110
I know. I'll talk to him.

07:47.178 --> 07:48.812
It's, it's just, it's just...

07:48.880 --> 07:51.515
He's so bad at moving his body.

07:53.518 --> 07:55.552
Steve, your mom and I
are paying a lot of money

07:55.620 --> 07:56.820
for you to go to this school.

07:56.888 --> 07:58.121
More like so you can go!

07:58.206 --> 07:59.706
All you care about
is taking me there

07:59.774 --> 08:01.241
so you can be friends
with that senator.

08:01.309 --> 08:02.409
Friends?

08:02.477 --> 08:03.710
Did he use that word?

08:03.778 --> 08:05.078
God, you're embarrassing!

08:05.146 --> 08:06.480
But you're gonna be
way more embarrassed

08:06.547 --> 08:07.981
if you make me go back there.

08:08.049 --> 08:10.183
I'll act like a wolfman.

08:10.251 --> 08:11.952
No, you won't.

08:12.020 --> 08:13.437
I'm a wolfman.

08:13.504 --> 08:15.439
My dad is Stan Smith.

08:15.506 --> 08:17.240
Don't put him
on any task forces!

08:17.308 --> 08:18.292
You wouldn't do that!

08:18.359 --> 08:19.943
And I'd pant real fast!

08:21.062 --> 08:22.796
Wear makeup under the eyes.

08:24.032 --> 08:25.299
Is that what you want, dad?!

08:25.366 --> 08:26.833
You know I got the pipes!

08:30.254 --> 08:32.456
Die,
demon of the night!

08:32.523 --> 08:33.724
I was joking!
He was joking!

08:33.791 --> 08:34.691
What?

08:34.759 --> 08:35.958
Don't joke about that.

08:36.027 --> 08:37.294
I won't!
We won't!

08:38.880 --> 08:40.313
I do a serious job.

08:40.381 --> 08:41.615
I don't need this.

08:41.683 --> 08:44.217
We really appreciate
everything you do.

08:46.854 --> 08:47.788
Here we are.

08:47.855 --> 08:49.289
Stuffington Academy.

08:49.357 --> 08:51.925
I'm glad we were able
to come to an agreement on this.

08:51.993 --> 08:53.860
Have a good day at school, son.

08:53.928 --> 08:56.913
I'm already having a good day
'cause you called me son.

08:56.981 --> 08:58.548
Now give me a kiss.

08:58.616 --> 09:00.951
Kiss me on the lips, dad.

09:01.019 --> 09:03.754
I want that kind of relationship
with you.

09:05.623 --> 09:07.491
You thought about it.
I saw it.

09:13.460 --> 09:16.462
I'm so excited
to go to school here, dad.

09:16.529 --> 09:18.130
Hey, hey, should I
come out of the closet

09:18.198 --> 09:20.098
and then make a big stink
when they won't let me

09:20.166 --> 09:22.034
take my 50-year-old boyfriend
to the prom?

09:22.101 --> 09:24.102
No! You have to
behave yourself.

09:25.755 --> 09:26.889
All right, there's the senator.

09:26.956 --> 09:28.357
Now, get in good
with his daughter

09:28.424 --> 09:29.491
and it'll help me a lot.

09:29.559 --> 09:31.260
Gotcha! Sex the daughter.

09:31.327 --> 09:33.395
I'm serious, Roger, I have
a lot riding on this.

09:33.463 --> 09:34.563
Just be normal.

09:34.631 --> 09:36.365
Senator Buckingham!

09:36.432 --> 09:38.233
I want you to meet
my son, Steve.

09:38.301 --> 09:39.401
Your eminence.

09:39.469 --> 09:41.436
This must be
your beautiful young wife.

09:42.505 --> 09:43.906
That's my daughter Cookie.

09:43.973 --> 09:45.607
Don't be late for class,
you two.

09:45.675 --> 09:48.227
So, Cookie, do you like ponies?

09:48.294 --> 09:49.845
Your boy's quite the
little gentleman.

09:49.913 --> 09:51.280
Thank you, sir.

09:51.347 --> 09:53.182
Say, are we going to play
a round this afternoon?

09:53.249 --> 09:54.683
Totally!
I'd love to play around!

09:54.751 --> 09:55.984
Either we could see a movie

09:56.052 --> 09:57.986
and try the new Mexican place
at the food court...

09:58.054 --> 09:59.555
I mean a round of golf.

09:59.622 --> 10:02.124
"A round of golf."

10:02.192 --> 10:05.394
Like a set of tennis
or a game of checkers.

10:05.461 --> 10:07.462
Ah!

10:07.530 --> 10:08.831
Words.

10:11.284 --> 10:12.934
We pulled it off!

10:12.986 --> 10:14.736
Sorry. Forgot you
were back there.

10:14.787 --> 10:15.770
Why?!

10:15.822 --> 10:16.788
Oh, wow.

10:16.873 --> 10:18.073
Oh, geez, my eye.

10:18.124 --> 10:20.042
I-I got to go
to school like this!

10:20.109 --> 10:21.243
I'm not taking you to school.

10:21.294 --> 10:22.661
Your mom thinks
you're at Stuffington,

10:22.745 --> 10:24.830
and we can't be getting two
report cards in the mail.

10:24.914 --> 10:26.582
But what about my education?

10:26.633 --> 10:28.550
Steve, you know how
we love the musical <i>Annie?</i>

10:28.618 --> 10:29.801
I love <i>Annie!</i>

10:29.886 --> 10:31.169
Yeah, notch it down.
I know.

10:31.254 --> 10:33.188
Well, you're gonna be
street smart like her,

10:33.256 --> 10:34.673
have a hard-knock
life! Get out.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.728
So, can I just hang out
at the arcade every day?

10:39.796 --> 10:41.463
Yeah, whatever.
All you have to do

10:41.531 --> 10:43.398
is walk out the door with me
every morning,

10:43.466 --> 10:45.267
so your mom thinks
you're going to stuffington.

10:47.153 --> 10:49.087
Sandy!

10:49.155 --> 10:50.539
His name is Ronald!

10:50.607 --> 10:52.157
You trying to rename my dog?!

10:52.242 --> 10:54.493
This guy's trying
to rename my dog!

11:03.453 --> 11:06.622
Okay, okay, that's enough.

11:06.689 --> 11:10.125
Consuela, now you're a member
of the chicas freakas.

11:19.018 --> 11:21.420
You know how to handle a gun.

11:21.487 --> 11:24.456
As long as that's not sexual
innuendo, then you're right.

11:25.592 --> 11:27.025
You're more girl than boy.

11:27.093 --> 11:28.727
You want to be
part of our gang?

11:28.795 --> 11:30.162
Might as well.

11:30.229 --> 11:32.030
It's pretty boring when
everyone's at school anyway.

11:32.098 --> 11:33.565
Want to play table hockey?

11:33.633 --> 11:35.334
After you join.

11:35.401 --> 11:37.302
Kick her ass!

11:39.572 --> 11:40.839
Aah...

11:40.907 --> 11:42.491
Aah...

11:42.558 --> 11:43.659
Aah...

11:43.726 --> 11:44.576
Aah...

11:47.246 --> 11:48.680
Beautiful shot!

11:48.748 --> 11:50.882
Thank you.

11:54.887 --> 11:57.623
Look! Your
favorite celebrity!

11:57.690 --> 11:59.491
Smack!

11:59.559 --> 12:00.943
Nicely played.

12:10.069 --> 12:13.255
Senator, we've known each other
for nearly two days now.

12:13.323 --> 12:14.906
Can I ask you a favor?

12:14.991 --> 12:17.576
Sure. Come by tonight for
dinner and we can talk.

12:17.660 --> 12:20.529
But let me warn you, I
have a rule about favors.

12:20.580 --> 12:22.114
I give everybody just one.

12:22.198 --> 12:25.083
I have a similar rule
about bubble gum.

12:38.831 --> 12:40.265
Beautiful.

12:40.333 --> 12:43.335
Uh, I feel beautiful.

12:46.088 --> 12:47.689
I did it!

12:47.757 --> 12:49.107
I made waves!

12:49.175 --> 12:50.959
I'm like this
with the senator now.

12:51.027 --> 12:52.227
He's having me
for dinner tonight,

12:52.295 --> 12:54.129
and I'm gonna ask him to put me

12:54.197 --> 12:55.864
on the interagency
task force as a favor.

12:55.932 --> 12:57.065
Ooh, what's that?

12:57.133 --> 12:58.233
It's basically this thing

12:58.301 --> 13:00.002
that will change
everything in my life.

13:00.069 --> 13:02.671
Everything in my life
will be better if I get it,

13:02.739 --> 13:04.573
and I'll be really
disappointed if I don't.

13:04.624 --> 13:06.608
Francine, I played the...

13:06.659 --> 13:09.311
My God! Did you get
in a fight at school?

13:09.379 --> 13:10.545
No. Look, you know,

13:10.613 --> 13:12.681
I'm gonna be a straight
shooter with you now.

13:12.749 --> 13:15.117
I think I screwed
the pooch on this one.
What?

13:15.184 --> 13:16.852
You know how you said
try to be friends

13:16.919 --> 13:18.587
with the senator's daughter?
Yeah.

13:18.654 --> 13:21.073
Well, it began like that,
and then middle, middle, middle,

13:21.140 --> 13:23.759
and then I sold her
to a drug dealer. The end.

13:23.826 --> 13:24.793
You what?!

13:24.844 --> 13:27.145
Are you seriously
mad at me, Stan?

13:27.213 --> 13:29.464
You're the who's always telling
me to go with my instincts.

13:29.532 --> 13:30.899
I thought you'd be proud of me.

13:30.967 --> 13:32.184
Ah, there's a blue
Jay out there.

13:32.251 --> 13:33.752
I don't want
to see the blue Jay.

13:33.820 --> 13:34.920
Oh, it's so blue.

13:34.987 --> 13:36.088
You're not gonna
want to miss this.

13:36.155 --> 13:37.055
No.

13:37.123 --> 13:38.757
Stan...

13:38.825 --> 13:40.409
Fine.
Oh, it's gone.

13:40.476 --> 13:42.144
Why would you sell the girl?!

13:42.211 --> 13:44.546
Why would you not look at
the blue Jay earlier?!

13:49.994 --> 13:51.594
You sold the
senator's daughter?!

13:51.662 --> 13:52.996
How did this happen?!

13:53.063 --> 13:55.465
Ugh, I've told this story
so many times today.

13:55.533 --> 13:57.200
You should just ask
my hairdresser.

13:57.268 --> 13:58.868
Roger!
Okay, okay.

13:58.936 --> 14:01.471
So, I was trying
to be her best friend,

14:01.539 --> 14:02.705
like you wanted...

14:02.756 --> 14:04.591
So, Cookie, do you like ponies?

14:04.675 --> 14:06.209
Uh... no.

14:06.277 --> 14:07.811
I'm almost 16.

14:07.878 --> 14:09.846
Oh. So what <i>do</i> you like?

14:09.914 --> 14:11.648
Cocaine and stuff.

14:11.715 --> 14:13.183
Yay!

14:19.340 --> 14:22.008
Oh, Patrick.

14:22.076 --> 14:23.309
Wake up, bitch!

14:23.377 --> 14:24.511
Get your ass up!

14:25.696 --> 14:26.930
Wake up!

14:26.997 --> 14:28.615
Ow! I'm awake!
What do you want?

14:28.682 --> 14:30.149
I want the money you owe me.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.484
I don't have any more money.

14:31.552 --> 14:34.120
Take this fool outside
and shoot him in the head.

14:34.188 --> 14:35.622
I don't want to go outside!

14:35.689 --> 14:37.023
Hey, it's beautiful out.

14:37.091 --> 14:38.791
You've been inside all day.

14:38.859 --> 14:41.845
Now, you are gonna go out there,
get some fresh air,

14:41.912 --> 14:43.713
and get shot in the head.

14:43.781 --> 14:45.949
Wait. How much
do I owe?
300 bucks.

14:46.016 --> 14:47.750
I'll sell you the girl for $300.

14:47.818 --> 14:49.319
Plus $1.35 for the bus.

14:49.386 --> 14:52.405
Oh, and the name of a plumber
I can trust at my house

14:52.473 --> 14:54.757
when I go to work...
I-I'm asking everybody.

14:54.825 --> 14:56.893
JKM Plumbing's
coming on Tuesday.

14:56.961 --> 14:59.913
So we can put the wooden spoon
back in the kitchen.

14:59.980 --> 15:02.198
No more having to chop.

15:02.266 --> 15:04.167
God, Roger, how
could you sell her?!

15:04.235 --> 15:06.135
Stan, you're focusing
on the wrong thing.

15:06.203 --> 15:07.971
The wooden spoon's
for pasta again.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.341
Hello.

15:11.408 --> 15:13.443
Stan, my daughter
didn't come home from school.

15:13.510 --> 15:16.312
Now, last time I talked to her,
she was with Steve.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.047
Yes! Yes! Uh,
they're right here.

15:18.115 --> 15:21.184
They are here playing safely
in the safeness of my house.

15:21.252 --> 15:22.835
No, we're not!

15:24.972 --> 15:27.240
Anyway, sir, she's
here and she's safe.

15:27.308 --> 15:28.942
Oh, good.
I was worried.

15:29.009 --> 15:32.312
Now, just bring Cookie home
when you come over for dinner.

15:32.379 --> 15:34.814
Take it easy, Stan.
Let's just...

15:34.882 --> 15:36.883
Let's just lower our guns.

15:36.951 --> 15:38.851
Pow! Second gun!

15:43.574 --> 15:45.074
Hmm, none of this
looks familiar.

15:45.142 --> 15:46.743
You dumb-ass! Where
did you leave her?

15:46.810 --> 15:48.978
I don't know.
I was pretty messed up, Stan.

15:49.029 --> 15:50.830
Maybe I'm too sober
to remember.

15:50.915 --> 15:53.149
Maybe if I was messed up now?

15:53.200 --> 15:55.285
Forget it. Fine. Just thought
you wanted to find her.

16:01.825 --> 16:03.509
14 blocks straight ahead,

16:03.594 --> 16:05.545
then you're gonna take
a right on Euclid.

16:05.629 --> 16:07.347
Wow, Roger, you're
really focused.

16:07.431 --> 16:09.549
Yeah, I thought it would help.

16:12.669 --> 16:14.687
It'll be the fourth
building on your left,

16:14.772 --> 16:16.839
just past the recycling plant.

16:18.125 --> 16:19.508
Why are you stopping?

16:19.560 --> 16:20.660
It's a red light.

16:20.728 --> 16:22.462
I didn't stop for red lights.

16:38.479 --> 16:42.065
Hey. Hi. I'm just here
to pick up Cookie.

16:42.132 --> 16:43.983
What?
The, uh...

16:44.051 --> 16:46.486
The, uh, girl there
on the couch.

16:46.553 --> 16:47.654
Which one?

16:49.323 --> 16:51.758
Uh... well, the, um,

16:51.825 --> 16:54.027
uh... h-how do I say this?

16:54.094 --> 16:56.896
Uh, th-the one with
the straightest hair.

16:56.964 --> 16:59.399
She's, uh, the one
on the end there.

16:59.466 --> 17:02.335
I mean, uh, if you were
handing out sunscreen,

17:02.403 --> 17:04.137
you'd give it to her first.

17:04.204 --> 17:06.138
The white bitch?
Ah, yes, thank you.

17:06.205 --> 17:07.940
Yes, yes,
the-the white bitch.

17:08.008 --> 17:09.008
What's he want?

17:09.076 --> 17:10.560
He's here for the white girl.

17:10.627 --> 17:13.096
She's mine! Everything
in this room is mine!

17:13.163 --> 17:14.998
Got it? The girl,
the coffeemaker,

17:15.065 --> 17:16.031
the... whoa!

17:16.099 --> 17:17.834
Whose is that?

17:17.901 --> 17:19.035
Oh, that's Carl's.

17:19.103 --> 17:20.169
Too scary, Carl.

17:20.237 --> 17:21.637
Get it out of here.

17:21.704 --> 17:22.839
No. You know what?

17:22.906 --> 17:24.374
Give it to this fool.

17:24.441 --> 17:25.775
He's on his way out.

17:31.265 --> 17:33.099
Ah. I see.

17:33.167 --> 17:35.034
I'll be on my way.

17:38.922 --> 17:40.857
Is this coffee fresh?

17:40.924 --> 17:42.225
Who made this?

17:42.292 --> 17:45.028
Yo! What time was
the coffee made?

17:52.403 --> 17:54.120
We're going straight to
the senator's for dinner.

17:54.204 --> 17:55.455
How do we sober her up?

17:55.539 --> 17:56.622
We don't.

17:56.707 --> 17:58.107
She's... she is strung out.

17:58.158 --> 18:00.576
But she's a heavy user
with a massive tolerance,

18:00.627 --> 18:02.161
so she might pull it together.

18:02.246 --> 18:03.612
She also might die.

18:03.664 --> 18:05.164
Either way, I'm eating dessert.

18:05.249 --> 18:07.083
I've been very good this week.

18:08.836 --> 18:11.471
It was great getting you
on the course today, Stan.

18:11.538 --> 18:13.005
Have you thought
about your favor?

18:13.073 --> 18:14.674
A favor?

18:14.742 --> 18:17.744
I did some <i>favors</i> today.

18:17.811 --> 18:19.512
Oh, she sure did!

18:19.580 --> 18:21.447
Shaking up medicine
at the old folks home.

18:21.515 --> 18:22.432
We all did it.

18:24.568 --> 18:26.352
Good idea, Cookie!
Let's dig in!

18:29.306 --> 18:30.673
Come on!

18:30.741 --> 18:31.974
Bravo, Cookie.

18:32.042 --> 18:33.709
Another face plant.

18:33.777 --> 18:36.579
Lessie! Bring in
the <i>Pulp Fiction</i> kit!

18:36.647 --> 18:39.482
You... you know
about her drug problem?

18:39.550 --> 18:40.750
All too well.

18:40.818 --> 18:42.702
But I don't have time
to deal with it.

18:42.770 --> 18:45.071
For men like us, Stan,

18:45.139 --> 18:48.174
for men of power and authority,

18:48.242 --> 18:51.477
well, there's career
and there's family.

18:51.545 --> 18:54.480
And sometimes you have to
focus on what's important...

18:54.548 --> 18:56.149
And that's career.

18:56.216 --> 18:59.085
So, spit it out,
what's your favor?

18:59.153 --> 19:01.687
Well, since you assign
the task force positions...

19:01.755 --> 19:03.689
Take it.

19:03.757 --> 19:06.559
A phone call at a time like this
couldn't possibly change

19:06.627 --> 19:08.761
the nature of the favor
you're going to ask.

19:08.829 --> 19:10.379
Hello.

19:10.447 --> 19:12.081
Stan! Oh, my God, Stan!

19:12.149 --> 19:13.616
Steve's been arrested!

19:13.684 --> 19:15.051
Whoa, whoa, baby, calm down.

19:15.119 --> 19:17.220
He robbed a pharmacy!
People are in the hospital!

19:17.287 --> 19:18.454
Armed robbery!
He's in jail!

19:18.522 --> 19:20.089
People are always
in the hospital, baby...

19:20.157 --> 19:21.591
That's what they build them for.

19:21.658 --> 19:23.476
Stan! What are we gonna do?!

19:23.544 --> 19:25.845
Look, it's gonna be fine,
It's a first offense.

19:25.913 --> 19:27.246
You have to do something!

19:27.314 --> 19:29.315
He's your son!

19:35.355 --> 19:37.890
Okay, I know what my favor is.

19:39.359 --> 19:41.644
I washed you in the sink
when you were a baby!

19:41.712 --> 19:43.279
I ain't gonna let you die!

19:45.165 --> 19:46.365
There you are.

19:46.433 --> 19:48.134
You want a piece of cake?

19:48.202 --> 19:50.736
I hate you, Lessie!

19:50.804 --> 19:53.739
Mm, mm, you're
a troubled child.

19:56.210 --> 19:57.610
I don't know who you know,

19:57.678 --> 20:00.079
but it must be someone
pretty high up.

20:00.147 --> 20:03.816
I mean, not the President,
but more than the mayor.

20:03.884 --> 20:06.786
Just from the feel of it,
I'd say it was a...

20:06.854 --> 20:08.721
Third-term senator? U.S.

20:08.789 --> 20:10.289
Not state, of course.

20:10.357 --> 20:12.592
Wow! Exactly right!

20:12.659 --> 20:14.193
Yeah. It's on
the form here.

20:14.261 --> 20:16.195
Ha-ha! Wasted
your time!

20:16.263 --> 20:17.630
I'm sorry, dad.

20:17.698 --> 20:20.032
No, I'm the one
who should be sorry.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.534
I was playing the career game

20:21.602 --> 20:23.769
when I should have been
focusing on what's important...

20:23.837 --> 20:25.037
Focusing on you.

20:25.105 --> 20:27.256
I just want to go back
to my old school.

20:27.324 --> 20:28.908
That's all I want, too, son.

20:28.976 --> 20:30.576
Your face is freaking me out.

20:30.644 --> 20:32.445
You look like
the cashier at CVS.

20:32.512 --> 20:34.463
How are we gonna
explain this to mom?

20:34.531 --> 20:36.148
Don't worry,
I'll take care of that.

20:36.216 --> 20:38.067
We'll blame the robbery
on one of those

20:38.135 --> 20:40.570
snotty private school kids.

20:42.873 --> 20:45.441
You on the run, too, huh?

20:46.944 --> 20:49.545
I was framed. Who are you?

20:49.613 --> 20:52.615
My name's Johnny.
Johnny Mind.

20:52.683 --> 20:53.783
