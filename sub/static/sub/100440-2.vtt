00:38.906 --> 00:40.500
It's all in the wrist, Mac.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.585
Actually, do you mind?

00:42.670 --> 00:44.353
No.It's all in the math.

00:44.470 --> 00:46.080
Uh-huh.

00:47.690 --> 00:49.935
Velocity and launch angle
determine trajectory,

00:50.020 --> 00:53.087
and distance
over a parabolic arc.

00:54.435 --> 00:55.914
RILEY:
Ooh!

00:56.507 --> 00:59.517
Uh, yeah, like I said,
it's, uh, all in the wrist.

00:59.602 --> 01:01.085
Eh, I must have
got a bad one.

01:01.169 --> 01:02.347
All right, well, whatever.

01:02.431 --> 01:04.218
The Skee-Ball crown
belongs to you.

01:04.303 --> 01:05.525
Oh, well, thank you.

01:05.719 --> 01:07.158
You're very welcome.

01:07.648 --> 01:09.632
Seriously, though,
thanks for reaching out.

01:09.866 --> 01:10.921
Yeah, man.

01:11.006 --> 01:13.078
In the last year and a half
the Phoenix was down,

01:13.163 --> 01:15.132
it's kind of scary how fast
we all drifted apart.

01:15.217 --> 01:16.141
Yeah.

01:16.226 --> 01:17.650
I could've made more
of an effort, though.

01:17.734 --> 01:19.789
That was on all of us.

01:20.523 --> 01:23.368
So here's me
checking in on you.

01:23.452 --> 01:24.992
Oh, well, thank you.

01:25.202 --> 01:26.902
I don't know why,
though. I'm fine.

01:27.467 --> 01:28.671
Why wouldn't I be?

01:28.756 --> 01:29.852
Oh, come on, Mac.

01:29.936 --> 01:32.046
You and Desi have been
sniping at each other

01:32.131 --> 01:33.132
like Bieber and Selena.

01:33.217 --> 01:34.921
It's not that bad.

01:35.390 --> 01:37.210
I'm saying it's
fine, it's fine.

01:38.648 --> 01:41.015
So... what happened?

01:41.100 --> 01:42.735
[scoffs]
Why'd you two break it off?

01:43.014 --> 01:46.081
A long story
for another time.

01:46.214 --> 01:47.672
- I get it.
- What about you? Are you...?

01:47.756 --> 01:49.413
Are you dating anybody?
Seeing people?

01:50.327 --> 01:51.391
No.

01:51.476 --> 01:53.389
- No one?
- No. No, no, no.

01:53.516 --> 01:55.649
If you add up the train wreck
of me and Billy,

01:55.734 --> 01:58.444
and then Bozer losing Leanna
to a deep cover op,

01:58.529 --> 01:59.490
and now you and Desi...

01:59.575 --> 02:00.579
And let's not
forget everything

02:00.663 --> 02:02.146
that Matty and
Ethan went through.

02:02.230 --> 02:06.367
Exactly. The casualty rate for
relationships is catastrophic.

02:06.451 --> 02:07.673
[laughs]

02:07.922 --> 02:09.762
It's the Phoenix jinx, man.Yeah.

Raul gave me these when I was
in Havana for Fidel's funeral.

03:27.532 --> 03:29.483
Major Frost,
yours for the taking?

03:29.568 --> 03:32.077
[laughs]
No thank you, Mr. Taylor.

03:32.265 --> 03:34.760
John? Well, if-if you're gonna
give the hard sell,

03:34.844 --> 03:36.805
- I'll indulge.
- Did anyone ever tell you

03:36.889 --> 03:38.953
- you are a pushover?
- [laughs]

03:39.038 --> 03:40.796
TAYLOR:
Ah. Perfect timing.

03:41.038 --> 03:42.219
Angus MacGyver,

03:42.304 --> 03:46.424
Matty Webber, meet General
John Acosta and Major Anne Frost

03:46.508 --> 03:48.155
from the Department of Defense.
John and I...

03:48.239 --> 03:52.000
We go way back to when I was
running Spearhead Operations.

03:52.085 --> 03:54.726
Oh. Promise not
to hold that against you.

03:54.811 --> 03:56.445
What brings you here,
General?

03:56.530 --> 03:58.482
Are you familiar
with the term "Red Cell"?

03:58.567 --> 03:59.655
MacGYVER:
Of course.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.959
A Red Cell is a team

04:01.067 --> 04:02.756
that finds vulnerabilities
in security systems.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.077
Precisely.

04:04.162 --> 04:06.342
And while we have our
own Red Cell teams,

04:06.427 --> 04:07.482
from what Taylor says

04:07.567 --> 04:09.969
about the Phoenix,
especially you,

04:10.053 --> 04:13.799
Mr. MacGyver,
your unorthodox methods are

04:13.883 --> 04:15.264
just what we need.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.077
Well, I'm flattered,

04:19.161 --> 04:20.805
but what exactly
are you asking of us?

04:20.890 --> 04:22.327
ACOSTA: My command
oversees security

04:22.412 --> 04:24.193
at a DARPA lab
south of Los Angeles.

04:24.278 --> 04:26.093
This lab is our premier facility

04:26.178 --> 04:27.813
for developing
cutting-edge military

04:27.897 --> 04:29.460
technologies.
We've received

04:29.545 --> 04:30.555
credible intel
that it's been

04:30.639 --> 04:31.947
targeted by foreign agents.

04:32.233 --> 04:33.632
And you want us to pretend

04:33.717 --> 04:35.366
to be these foreign agents,
break in,

04:35.451 --> 04:37.632
and test your security
before they actually try it?

04:37.717 --> 04:39.811
Exactly.
We need a fresh set of eyes

04:39.896 --> 04:41.545
on how our lab's protected.

04:44.305 --> 04:46.904
I'd like to hear some more
details before we commit.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.523
ACOSTA: I would think, given
your need to have your security

04:49.607 --> 04:51.837
clearance reinstated,
you'd jump at the chance.

04:51.921 --> 04:55.101
Which is why we're actually
thrilled to commit.

04:55.185 --> 04:57.607
Here. Enjoy the cigars,
my compliments.

04:57.901 --> 05:01.154
And we'd like to thank you
for this opportunity, John.

05:04.035 --> 05:05.326
MATTY: What the hell
are you doing?

05:05.410 --> 05:07.347
I just secured our
first government contract.

05:07.529 --> 05:09.244
Which apparently is being done

05:09.329 --> 05:11.277
in exchange for our
security clearances?

05:11.378 --> 05:12.395
Something you said was
already taken care of.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.676
We find ourselves
in the unfortunate position

05:14.761 --> 05:16.966
of having to prove our worth
to the powers that be.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.256
Matty's connections
and my considerable charm

05:19.340 --> 05:20.866
will only get us so far.

05:20.950 --> 05:22.084
When that well runs dry,

05:22.168 --> 05:23.651
if we are not in,
then we are out.

05:23.735 --> 05:25.699
And if we are out,
then we are finished.

05:27.292 --> 05:28.604
[sighs]

05:28.746 --> 05:30.902
- You could have told us.
- I just did.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.980
Pull this off, Angus,

05:37.009 --> 05:39.863
and you all get your
secret agent badges back.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.976
MacGYVER: Our objective is
to test the security

05:45.061 --> 05:47.473
of this DARPA lab by
penetrating its defenses

05:47.558 --> 05:49.402
and stealing a project
known as "Quirk."

05:49.487 --> 05:51.364
And what exactly is Quirk?

05:51.449 --> 05:52.644
We don't know.

05:52.729 --> 05:54.512
MacGYVER: Now,
the military guards at the lab

05:54.597 --> 05:56.568
will be unaware that
General Acosta hired us.

05:56.653 --> 05:59.136
Which means if we come across
a trigger-happy soldier,

05:59.410 --> 06:01.801
we might catch
a very real bullet.

06:02.066 --> 06:03.746
TAYLOR:
No risk, no reward.

06:03.910 --> 06:07.090
Now, to beat their systems,
we all have to play a part.

06:07.175 --> 06:09.301
They've got facial recognition

06:09.402 --> 06:11.957
and a backscatter vehicle X-ray
at the parking entrance.

06:12.042 --> 06:13.629
Badges with an
evolving algorithm,

06:13.714 --> 06:16.200
and scientists who work at
all hours of the day and night.

06:16.284 --> 06:18.332
Plus armed patrols,
and a six-man tactical team

06:18.416 --> 06:19.434
on standby.

06:19.519 --> 06:21.621
- So what's the way in?
- TAYLOR: Social engineering.

06:21.706 --> 06:23.407
The weak spot of
any security system

06:23.491 --> 06:25.722
is always the human element.

06:26.542 --> 06:28.379
MacGYVER: Riley will invite
all 12 scientists

06:28.464 --> 06:30.450
to a team-building mixer,
which they will think

06:30.535 --> 06:32.277
is being hosted
by their employer.

06:32.362 --> 06:34.472
RILEY: And while they're
hitting the open bar,

06:34.691 --> 06:36.215
we'll be hitting the lab.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.238
And the card swipe
through the lab door?

06:39.028 --> 06:41.370
You said the badges have
an evolving algorithm.

06:41.698 --> 06:43.769
With a wireless RFID reader,
if I get

06:43.854 --> 06:47.558
within a foot of an active
badge, I can clone it.

06:48.239 --> 06:49.848
RILEY: As for the
facial rec system,

06:49.933 --> 06:52.168
Taylor's beard negates
half the nodal points.

06:52.253 --> 06:54.310
And I can swap out
the extant data from his image

06:54.395 --> 06:57.223
- with one of these fine folks.
- [beeping]

06:57.520 --> 06:59.044
Well, that gets me
through the gate,

06:59.129 --> 07:00.873
but what about you,
Angus and Desi?

07:01.224 --> 07:02.663
We'll hitch a ride.

07:03.309 --> 07:05.568
Lead should confuse
the backscatter X-ray,

07:05.653 --> 07:08.583
and Desi and I will hide
in the trunk.

07:09.091 --> 07:11.443
Seriously?
Sounds a little cozy.

07:11.528 --> 07:13.541
Relax, it's a short trip.

07:17.022 --> 07:20.159
[sniffing]

07:20.417 --> 07:21.919
Back to wearing that
body spray?

07:22.004 --> 07:23.095
[scoffs]

07:23.544 --> 07:24.887
Breaking up
means we never have to

07:24.972 --> 07:26.223
have this conversation again.

07:26.308 --> 07:27.653
Your plan put us in a trunk.

07:27.738 --> 07:30.222
- And for the record...
- Hmm?

07:30.307 --> 07:31.909
...you said you liked
"Mountain Rain"

07:31.994 --> 07:33.128
- when we started dating.
- I said

07:33.212 --> 07:34.845
a lot of things
I didn't really mean.

07:35.348 --> 07:37.470
In the end, so did you, right?

07:38.350 --> 07:40.700
Yeah, we can't do this
right now.

07:47.319 --> 07:48.563
[sighs]

07:48.828 --> 07:51.649
I feel my tension
melting away.

07:51.734 --> 07:52.973
I am relaxed,

07:53.058 --> 07:54.884
[over radio]:
...<i>calm and centered.</i>

07:54.969 --> 07:57.021
<i>I feel my worries and fears</i>

07:57.106 --> 07:59.821
<i>released to the universe.</i>

08:00.146 --> 08:02.306
Who patched in Tony Robbins?

08:02.532 --> 08:04.621
- I am at peace.
- [scanner chimes]

08:07.578 --> 08:09.813
- You're good to go.
- Thank you.

08:10.021 --> 08:12.493
Positive affirmations are
a proven balm

08:12.774 --> 08:15.080
for reducing anxiety.

08:17.341 --> 08:18.650
RILEY:
All right,

08:19.626 --> 08:21.251
12 minutes
till the next sweep.

08:21.351 --> 08:22.985
So, you didn't kill
each other?

08:23.212 --> 08:26.178
- Almost.
- Next time.

08:27.371 --> 08:29.133
[beeps]

08:32.782 --> 08:34.236
DESI:
Why are there no cameras inside?

08:34.320 --> 08:35.842
MacGYVER: Well, the work here
is so sensitive,

08:35.927 --> 08:38.657
it's a greater risk
to record than not.

08:38.741 --> 08:41.595
TAYLOR: Until now.
Let's find the Quirk.

08:45.315 --> 08:47.157
DESI:
"Feed me, Seymour."

08:48.723 --> 08:50.467
I think these are
bio-sensors.

08:50.551 --> 08:53.462
They're plants that
act as sentries.

08:53.954 --> 08:56.133
That is so cool.

08:56.342 --> 08:58.957
Um, if by cool
you mean terrifying.

08:59.081 --> 09:00.579
TAYLOR:
Angus.

09:00.664 --> 09:03.774
What do you make of
these... Frankenroaches?

09:06.124 --> 09:08.005
I think that these are drones.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.877
They're used for search
and rescue

09:10.962 --> 09:13.493
and radiation detection,
that sort of thing.

09:13.578 --> 09:15.954
Who in their right mind
would dream up

09:16.243 --> 09:18.423
remote control cockroaches?

09:18.508 --> 09:19.729
MacGYVER:
Check this out.

09:19.971 --> 09:21.323
Meta-materials.

09:21.407 --> 09:23.821
They bend light
around objects.

09:26.325 --> 09:28.589
[Taylor laughs softly]

09:30.297 --> 09:32.251
Oh, finally.

09:32.684 --> 09:36.931
My dream of owning
an invisibility cloak...

09:37.815 --> 09:40.759
is one step closer to reality.

09:41.224 --> 09:42.533
Okay.

09:42.970 --> 09:44.774
- Can we keep moving?
- Yep.

09:56.681 --> 09:59.056
TAYLOR:
"Quantum recursive chip."

09:59.141 --> 10:00.839
Q-R-C. Quir-Quirk!

10:02.144 --> 10:03.148
So what is it?

10:03.232 --> 10:05.735
Next generation
in microprocessors.

10:06.111 --> 10:08.116
This is... [sighs]

10:08.239 --> 10:10.540
The holy grail
of supercomputers.

10:11.955 --> 10:14.637
If computers are cars,
then this chip is the difference

10:14.722 --> 10:17.597
between a Model-T
and a Formula 1 racer.

10:17.681 --> 10:19.454
Right, so...

10:19.683 --> 10:21.166
what are we waiting for?

10:21.570 --> 10:23.559
- [buzzes]
- Well, first problem,

10:23.644 --> 10:25.518
the chamber's locked
with a retinal scanner.

10:25.602 --> 10:30.088
And I'm pretty sure
that only the three

10:30.172 --> 10:31.993
scientists who were
assigned to this

10:32.121 --> 10:33.743
have authority to access it.

10:33.828 --> 10:36.048
Well, we can easily
bypass that. Des?

10:36.773 --> 10:38.157
- You're up.
- What?

10:38.257 --> 10:39.257
Do your...

10:39.355 --> 10:41.183
- You want me...?
- Yes.

10:43.454 --> 10:44.814
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

10:44.943 --> 10:47.331
No, stop. Second problem.

10:47.536 --> 10:49.018
The quantum chip
has to be stored

10:49.103 --> 10:50.239
at an extremely cold
temperature,

10:50.323 --> 10:52.230
230 degrees Kelvin.230?

10:52.315 --> 10:53.971
230? That sounds very hot.

10:54.056 --> 10:55.366
Converted to
Fahrenheit, that's...

10:55.450 --> 10:57.275
- 45 degrees below zero.
- What happens

10:57.360 --> 10:58.730
if the chip warms up?

10:59.592 --> 11:01.167
It disintegrates.

11:01.252 --> 11:02.474
TAYLOR:
Hold on.

11:02.559 --> 11:05.777
So we have to steal something...

11:06.722 --> 11:09.136
that'll self-destruct
the moment it's stolen?

11:09.331 --> 11:10.620
MacGYVER:
Yes.

11:10.705 --> 11:12.910
- If that happens, we fail.
- DESI: Which means

11:12.995 --> 11:14.831
no security clearances.

11:15.402 --> 11:17.691
MacGYVER: And we're
done at the Phoenix.

11:22.168 --> 11:25.348
Hey, guys?
It's a little too quiet in there.

11:25.432 --> 11:27.535
Eight minutes
till the next patrol. Ticktock.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.785
TAYLOR:
Perhaps you'd, um...

11:28.870 --> 11:30.706
you'd care to sound
this out, Angus?

11:30.873 --> 11:33.574
Ideate?
Jam on some creative solutions?

11:33.659 --> 11:35.324
Just
got to think.

11:35.409 --> 11:37.168
Mm-hmm.
Gentle reminder,

11:37.253 --> 11:39.339
this is exactly why
we were hired to do this job.

11:39.441 --> 11:40.840
It's why I bought
the Phoenix.

11:40.925 --> 11:42.738
You solve problems
that can't be solved.

11:42.823 --> 11:45.245
- Fair point, Mac.
- Not helping, either one of you.

11:58.089 --> 12:00.746
Maybe I can build
a cold containment unit.

12:00.831 --> 12:02.841
- Portable cooler. I love it.
- It's not as easy as it sounds.

12:02.925 --> 12:05.855
But doable?
I-I'll take doable. Make yourself useful.

12:06.342 --> 12:07.955
And what about
the retinal scanner?

12:08.040 --> 12:11.264
Uh, that is where
Bozer comes in.

12:11.348 --> 12:13.527
I know you're not asking me
to get you an eye.

12:13.611 --> 12:15.790
An up close picture will do.

12:15.933 --> 12:17.836
<i>Charm your way over
to the scientists and get me</i>

12:17.920 --> 12:20.276
<i>- a close-up picture of an eye.</i>
- Oh, is that all?

12:20.361 --> 12:21.582
Hey, guys.

12:21.667 --> 12:24.233
Hey. Hey, everybody. I'm
glad I found you guys.

12:24.317 --> 12:27.620
My name is Adam. I start Monday
on the nucleotide project.

12:27.839 --> 12:29.620
- Oh.[laughing]:
- Yeah!

12:29.728 --> 12:31.949
May I?
Lei I.

12:32.284 --> 12:33.628
<i>You follow?
Everybody?</i>

12:33.758 --> 12:34.936
<i>Yeah. Let's do it, huh?</i>

12:35.130 --> 12:36.206
<i>Turn up, turn up.</i>

12:36.370 --> 12:38.291
<i>Turn up, turn up, turn up.</i>

12:38.375 --> 12:41.012
<i>Turnt it.
Okay, all right. Okay.</i>

12:41.097 --> 12:44.425
[laughs]
Yeah. Okay.

12:44.699 --> 12:47.629
MacGYVER: When it comes
to keeping something hot, or cold,

12:47.714 --> 12:49.645
your worst enemy
is actually air.

12:49.730 --> 12:50.855
Air conducts heat.

12:50.947 --> 12:53.839
So by creating a vacuum,
a space where there is no air,

12:53.956 --> 12:58.093
that leaves nothing to take
your heat, or your cold, away.

12:58.177 --> 13:01.480
And what's inside the vacuum
stays the same temperature.

13:01.646 --> 13:04.879
Bozer, you're under
four minutes now. Talk to me.

13:05.097 --> 13:06.433
Hey!

13:06.577 --> 13:08.756
[laughs]:
Oh! Look at that, huh?

13:08.840 --> 13:11.730
[quietly]:
Coming your way.

13:11.983 --> 13:13.422
[overlapping chatter]

13:13.870 --> 13:16.152
Are you recruiting
for a furry convention?

13:16.744 --> 13:19.332
- Ah! Oh, that's crazy.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:19.417 --> 13:20.521
- That's pretty cool.
- [quietly]: Best I could do.

13:20.605 --> 13:22.204
Just enhance,
zoom in on the eyes.

13:22.288 --> 13:23.707
- "Enhance"?
- Yeah. Sorry,

13:23.792 --> 13:25.621
Blade Runner,
this is way too low-res.

13:25.706 --> 13:27.296
You got to get
way closer for me.

13:27.380 --> 13:29.382
[♪♪]

13:39.886 --> 13:42.464
MacGYVER: Everybody thinks
these cans are filled with air,

13:42.566 --> 13:45.317
but it's actually a liquid
called HCF-134

13:45.402 --> 13:48.003
that rests at 60 degrees
below zero.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.614
Hold them upside down and
you're one wrong spray away

13:50.699 --> 13:51.621

Guys. Soldiers with guns

13:52.980 --> 13:54.784

any minute now.

13:54.870 --> 13:56.935
Okay, one portable cold
containment unit ready to go.

13:57.019 --> 13:59.620
All right, Bozer, Riley,
where is the eyeball?

13:59.705 --> 14:01.575
Doctor's telling me
I need my first pair of specs.

14:01.659 --> 14:03.756
Y-You know, I've got this app
for checking out frames.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.777
Here, what do you think?

14:06.635 --> 14:09.207
Oh. That's really cool.

14:09.292 --> 14:11.042
Yeah, take those off.
If you don't mind.

14:12.670 --> 14:14.019
[quietly]:
Okay.

- Down.

15:14.151 --> 15:16.719
Shut it down as in
connect the sensor array.

15:16.804 --> 15:18.586
You did not use
any one of those words.

15:18.671 --> 15:20.681
Well, communication always
was our issue, wasn't it?

15:20.765 --> 15:21.758
I speak six languages.

15:21.842 --> 15:23.438
Communication was
not our problem.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.235
Uh, guys, sorry to interrupt,

15:25.320 --> 15:26.743
but you just kicked
a hornet's nest.

this far just to give up now.

16:52.062 --> 16:54.067
I'm sure you're eager
to get this back.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.810
Yes, although I obviously
need to find

16:56.894 --> 16:58.290
a safer place to keep it.
[chuckles]

16:58.374 --> 16:59.465
[laughs softly]

16:59.866 --> 17:01.976
I promised and, as usual,
I delivered.

Now it's your turn, John.Yes.

17:05.347 --> 17:07.023
I'll make a call
and see that your people's

There's only, uh,

just one stop I need to make

17:23.444 --> 17:25.459
before we head back
to the barn.

17:27.256 --> 17:29.092
To a job well done.

17:29.177 --> 17:30.194
Hmm?

17:30.662 --> 17:31.944
Is this mandatory?

17:32.850 --> 17:35.022
Yeah. It's a team-building
exercise, all right?

17:35.107 --> 17:36.242
Look, we're here

18:02.091 --> 18:04.923
Federal arrest warrants have
been issued for the four of you.

18:05.008 --> 18:07.709
We're talking FBI, DHS,
down to the local authorities.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.772
You all just became
America's most wanted.

18:09.919 --> 18:11.924
This is a mistake.
Acosta must not have

18:12.008 --> 18:13.343

MATTY:
No, it's no mistake, Taylor.

18:15.263 --> 18:18.397
The general requested
the arrest warrants himself.

18:19.034 --> 18:20.600
Your old friend set us up.

the connection yet.

19:03.302 --> 19:06.319
But taking ourselves out
of the game is not an answer.

19:06.430 --> 19:09.076
Besides, if we turn ourselves
in, Acosta will disappear

19:09.161 --> 19:10.781
and any chance we have
of recovering the Quirk

19:10.865 --> 19:12.054
- will be gone.

20:18.806 --> 20:22.944
So, uh, anti-theft device
is basically a radio

20:23.028 --> 20:24.557
hardwired into a car

20:24.642 --> 20:26.600
that is sending out
a specific code

20:26.684 --> 20:28.744
to a specific frequency.

20:39.609 --> 20:41.440
Okay, so this...

20:41.525 --> 20:42.588
is an emulator.

20:42.673 --> 20:43.940
And once I turn it on,

20:44.025 --> 20:46.533
I'll be able
to emit the same code.

And then you can put that into
another car to lead them away.

20:48.662 --> 20:49.838
That's brilliant.

20:51.190 --> 20:53.888
[siren wailing,
tires screeching]

20:55.408 --> 20:57.108
First we need to
ditch our tail.

20:57.192 --> 20:59.804
[tires screeching]

21:13.557 --> 21:15.820
[tires screeching]

21:25.635 --> 21:28.214
- Good driving, Desi. Well done.
- RILEY: All right, we're clear

21:28.299 --> 21:30.577
for 15 seconds,
but the dragnet's closing in fast.

21:30.668 --> 21:33.674
All right, time to throw this emulator
in a decoy. Uh, that's my moment.

21:37.711 --> 21:38.712
[tires screeching]

21:43.797 --> 21:45.069
TAYLOR:
Yes!

21:46.882 --> 21:49.160
Yeah!
Still got it! Ha!

21:49.244 --> 21:50.843
[chuckles]

21:50.942 --> 21:52.944
[tires screeching]

21:57.731 --> 22:01.735
[siren approaching]

22:09.308 --> 22:10.817
DESI: Matty, we're in the clear.

22:10.902 --> 22:12.532
What's our next move,
besides get a new ride?

22:12.616 --> 22:14.838
MATTY: We shake the intel trees
to see if we can I.D.

22:14.922 --> 22:17.496
who General Acosta is delivering
this quantum chip to.

22:17.581 --> 22:19.598
I guess a box of Cuban
cigars run a distant second

22:19.683 --> 22:20.708
to whatever they're
offering him.

22:20.792 --> 22:22.231
Yeah, there's something
that we're missing.

22:22.315 --> 22:23.130
What?

22:23.215 --> 22:24.500
The chip.
It was air-gapped.

22:24.584 --> 22:27.277
Stored so that it was isolated
from contact with any computer.

22:27.362 --> 22:28.497
Why is that important?

22:28.582 --> 22:30.053
Because maybe it's not
just the chip itself,

22:30.137 --> 22:31.388
but what's on it
that's valuable.

22:31.472 --> 22:34.372
- Yeah, a chip that fast, if weaponized...
- RILEY: Yeah, like,

22:34.457 --> 22:36.083
with a Stuxnet-type virus...

22:36.168 --> 22:37.326
MATTY: It could take down
anything from

22:37.410 --> 22:40.519
our nation's air traffic
control to a nuclear reactor.

22:40.783 --> 22:42.561
And we'll get hung out
for that, too.

22:42.704 --> 22:44.622
Bozer, I think it's time
you reconnected

22:44.707 --> 22:46.387
- with last night's hookup.
- BOZER: Hannah?

22:46.535 --> 22:47.653
Why? Well,

22:47.738 --> 22:49.443
there's a lot we don't know
about this quantum chip,

22:49.527 --> 22:51.418
and any intel that you
could grab could help us.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.738
RILEY: I ran a script to
search the DoD mainframe.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.401
The general's name popped up
on a flight manifest.

22:56.769 --> 22:58.676
Is there any way to
reach him directly?

22:59.894 --> 23:01.597
I think I can make that happen.

23:14.640 --> 23:15.972
[beeping]

23:20.972 --> 23:22.582
Good to see you, my old friend.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.428
Taylor?
How did you find me?

23:24.513 --> 23:26.119
Why are you trying
not to be found?

23:26.204 --> 23:27.954
Look, we've been through
too much for you

23:28.039 --> 23:29.260
to pull something
like this, John.

23:29.344 --> 23:30.479
What's really
happening here?

23:30.563 --> 23:31.738
I'm sorry.

23:32.957 --> 23:36.221
They have my daughter
and my grandson.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.924
Who? Who has them?

23:41.008 --> 23:42.174
I don't know.

23:42.424 --> 23:44.658
But they knew everything
about me.

23:44.938 --> 23:46.987
Saw every potential countermove
I could make.

23:47.072 --> 23:48.410
Had me boxed in

23:48.494 --> 23:49.973
the minute this whole
nightmare started.

23:50.057 --> 23:50.932
MacGYVER: Let us help you.

23:51.017 --> 23:53.104
- We'll find a way to get your family back.
- Too late for that, MacGyver.

23:53.188 --> 23:55.124
General, please do not
hand over that chip.

23:55.728 --> 23:57.986
That's not what
they're asking of me.

23:59.119 --> 24:01.775
I only hope, when
this is all over,

24:01.900 --> 24:05.103
you... the whole country...

24:06.605 --> 24:09.041
- .can forgive me.
- TAYLOR: John!

24:12.205 --> 24:13.877
We'll be landing
right on schedule.

24:14.166 --> 24:15.564
Anything else
you need, sir?

24:15.649 --> 24:18.043
No, I'm all set.
Thank you, Major.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.885
[♪♪]

24:56.867 --> 24:58.958
Since we know the general
isn't going to sell the chip,

24:59.042 --> 25:00.308
the question we have
to answer now is:

25:00.392 --> 25:02.018
what could he use it for?

25:02.103 --> 25:03.382
Well, get this:

25:03.467 --> 25:05.080
the air base
Acosta's flying into,

25:05.165 --> 25:07.932
it's a hub for military
personnel en route to NORAD.

25:08.378 --> 25:09.823
DESI:
Like DEFCON 1,

25:09.908 --> 25:12.698
"we're all gonna die
in a nuclear winter" NORAD?

25:16.150 --> 25:19.261
It fits the pattern.
What pattern is that?

25:19.454 --> 25:22.401
Well, first someone targets
Los Angeles with a bioweapon,

25:22.486 --> 25:24.796
and now the United States
missile defense system.

25:25.096 --> 25:26.596
Wait. Hold up.

25:26.681 --> 25:28.301
Y-You're saying
this is part

25:28.386 --> 25:29.675
of your global
conspiracy theory?

25:29.760 --> 25:32.166
Well, think about it.
Martin Bishop, ex-DXS,

25:32.250 --> 25:33.847
aspiring arbiter
of death and chaos,

25:33.932 --> 25:35.560
told us his organization

25:35.644 --> 25:37.972
wanted to burn society's
pillars to the ground.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.683
Well, taking down NORAD
would be the right spark

25:40.768 --> 25:42.276
to start that kind of fire.

25:42.487 --> 25:44.101
[engine starts]

25:44.472 --> 25:45.836
Matty, we need
to warn them.

25:45.921 --> 25:48.316
MATTY: Without proof that the
general set you up, my warning

25:48.401 --> 25:50.682
- will fall on deaf ears.
- RILEY: And let's not forget,

25:50.792 --> 25:51.754
whoever's behind this

25:51.839 --> 25:53.441
has the general's daughter
and grandson.

25:53.526 --> 25:54.816
DESI: So if we
alert the base,

25:54.901 --> 25:56.020
we're signing
their death warrants.

25:56.104 --> 25:57.844
MATTY: Okay, guys,
we are out of options,

25:57.928 --> 25:59.676
and running out of time.
Two of you,

25:59.761 --> 26:02.631
get on the Phoenix jet
and stop Acosta; the other two,

26:02.715 --> 26:03.887
find and save his family.

26:03.972 --> 26:05.995
With every cop in the
nation looking for us?

26:09.014 --> 26:10.320
Okay.

26:13.324 --> 26:14.459
RILEY:
The general's daughter

26:14.544 --> 26:16.214
and grandson live
in a condo in Laguna.

26:16.339 --> 26:18.284
Okay, we'll start there
and hope the kidnappers

26:18.369 --> 26:20.003
left a trail we can follow.

26:23.288 --> 26:24.534
Where'd you get that photo?

26:24.619 --> 26:26.940
Ah, when I hacked into
the general's laptop

26:27.025 --> 26:28.160
so Taylor could chat,

26:28.245 --> 26:29.381
I might've cloned
his hard drive.

26:29.465 --> 26:30.904
Riley, that's
a proof-of-life photo.

26:31.061 --> 26:32.152
To make sure
he goes through with

26:32.236 --> 26:34.156
plugging the quantum chip
into the NORAD network.

26:35.182 --> 26:37.651
RILEY: The burner phone
they used to send the photo

26:37.736 --> 26:39.386
embedded a geotag.

26:40.175 --> 26:41.581
I got an address.

26:42.351 --> 26:43.706
Hold on a second.

26:47.982 --> 26:50.118
I can see
the kidnapper's reflection.

26:50.784 --> 26:52.362
He's not wearing a mask.

26:52.587 --> 26:55.027
Which means even if Acosta
goes through with it,

26:55.253 --> 26:57.723
they won't be left alive
when it's over.

27:07.128 --> 27:09.347
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>T-minus two minutes to lockdown.</i>

27:09.432 --> 27:10.573
[indistinct chatter]

27:10.658 --> 27:13.034
T-minus two minutes to lockdown.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.782
Looks like our luck
is holding out.

27:22.867 --> 27:25.199
Acosta's tour of the airbase
allowed us to get ahead of him.

27:25.283 --> 27:26.841
They're rather busy
bees in here,

27:26.926 --> 27:28.705
aren't they? Any idea
what they're planning?

27:28.790 --> 27:30.050
Simulated nuclear attack.

27:30.134 --> 27:31.940
Once this starts,
Cheyenne Mountain

27:32.025 --> 27:33.324
goes into lockdown,
and our chance

27:33.408 --> 27:34.410
of stopping
the general's gone.

27:34.494 --> 27:36.051
So, we need to get into
the NORAD command center

27:36.135 --> 27:38.432
before it's sealed.
These badges should do the trick.

27:38.589 --> 27:39.681
[phone rings]

27:39.765 --> 27:41.987
Hey, Boze, not exactly
a good time right now.

27:42.071 --> 27:43.772
You're gonna want to hear this,
Mac. It's not a virus

27:43.856 --> 27:45.003
on the quantum chip.

27:45.088 --> 27:46.917
- It's not? Then what is it?
- Hannah said

27:47.002 --> 27:48.308
it's a rootkit.

27:49.391 --> 27:51.396
- Copy.
- That's not a happy face.

27:51.559 --> 27:53.869
- It's a rootkit on the quantum chip.
- Meaning?

27:53.953 --> 27:55.823
It's a software tool
that gives the user

27:55.908 --> 27:58.487
complete and undetected control
of any network.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.668
So the people pulling
the general's strings

28:00.752 --> 28:02.238
aren't trying to sabotage
NORAD,

28:02.323 --> 28:03.887
- they want to control it.
- Yeah. Once that chip

28:03.971 --> 28:06.445
is plugged in, the entire United
States missile defense system

28:06.530 --> 28:09.580
- is in their hands.
- AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Attention all personnel.</i>

28:09.664 --> 28:12.245
<i>Lockdown in one minute.
Lockdown in one minute.</i>

28:12.330 --> 28:13.511
TAYLOR:
Well...

28:13.596 --> 28:15.464
I hate to draw attention
to ourselves, but...

28:15.693 --> 28:17.785
- we really need to get a move on.
- Yeah.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.589
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Prepare for lockdown.
Prepare for lockdown.</i>

28:31.133 --> 28:32.642
[banging on door]

28:35.499 --> 28:37.299
- WOMAN: It's the super!
- [banging continues]

28:50.618 --> 28:51.750
[both grunting]

29:09.419 --> 29:11.421
[grunting]

29:35.881 --> 29:39.014
- <i>On your knees!</i>
- [both panting]

29:44.035 --> 29:45.841
What was is lost...

29:47.754 --> 29:49.778
...but from death comes life.

29:59.317 --> 30:01.406
[tires screeching]

30:05.851 --> 30:07.334
[alarm blaring]

30:07.426 --> 30:09.144
Riley says they've freed
the general's family.

30:09.228 --> 30:11.228
Well done.

30:15.243 --> 30:18.072
[beeping]

30:20.268 --> 30:22.041
No dice, fellas.

30:22.149 --> 30:24.065
We've got command center
authorization.

30:24.150 --> 30:25.690
Not during the lockdown.

30:25.775 --> 30:27.606
Civvies get nuked
with the rest of us grunts.

30:27.810 --> 30:29.268
Didn't you get the e-mail?

30:30.325 --> 30:33.418
It must've gone to spam.
Well, mystery solved.

30:33.503 --> 30:36.073
- Uh, we-we've got to get through.
- No, you've got to

30:36.158 --> 30:37.554
get out of the way.

30:37.638 --> 30:40.862
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Commencing lockdown.
All personnel,</i>

30:40.946 --> 30:43.018
report to your stations
immediately.

30:47.612 --> 30:49.174
Tell the general
his family's safe,

30:49.259 --> 30:50.873
but communications
have been cut off.

30:51.185 --> 30:53.222
Any idea how to get past
that blast door?

30:53.306 --> 30:55.464
Well, if a nuclear bomb
can't knock them down,

30:55.549 --> 30:57.681
I'm not sure how
we're going to.

30:59.990 --> 31:02.831
The command center at NORAD
is completely sealed off

31:02.916 --> 31:04.780
for the duration
of the exercise.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.150
No exceptions?

31:06.387 --> 31:08.605
It wouldn't exactly be
a nuclear simulation

31:08.690 --> 31:10.916
if the phone lines were
left open, now, would it?

31:11.305 --> 31:12.682
Okay, Mac,
what's your next move?

31:12.767 --> 31:14.789
I'll, uh, let you know
when I have one.

31:14.874 --> 31:15.924
Any chance you can

31:16.009 --> 31:17.580
science your way through
a mountain of granite?

31:17.664 --> 31:19.404
There's no way I can get
through that much solid rock

31:19.488 --> 31:20.880
in the amount of
time that I have.

31:22.775 --> 31:24.644
But, uh, m-maybe
I don't have to.

31:24.729 --> 31:25.862
I'm not following.

31:25.947 --> 31:27.847
Okay, back when
Phoenix was DXS,

31:27.931 --> 31:30.284
its engineers consulted
in the original design

31:30.368 --> 31:31.736
of the NORAD station.

31:32.837 --> 31:35.307
Which means that we would have
the architectural plans.

31:35.392 --> 31:36.657
I'm on it.

31:36.742 --> 31:38.704
[alarm blaring]

31:38.942 --> 31:42.644
It seems like there was
a cave-in during

31:42.728 --> 31:44.137
the construction phase
of the command center.

31:44.221 --> 31:45.158
TAYLOR:
How does that help us?

31:45.243 --> 31:47.213
Well, there was a-a
rescue tunnel that was dug

31:47.298 --> 31:48.650
to evacuate
the trapped workers.

31:48.734 --> 31:50.151
But it was never

31:50.236 --> 31:51.973
refilled though.
It was only sealed at both ends.

31:52.057 --> 31:53.361
So, if I can access that,

31:53.446 --> 31:55.004
then I should be able to reach
that ventilation shaft

31:55.088 --> 31:56.072
and get inside.

31:56.157 --> 31:58.529
Well, I seem to be
a fifth wheel in this plan.

31:58.614 --> 32:00.572
How can I help?

32:03.469 --> 32:05.933
I can build a drilling tool
and a breathing apparatus

32:06.018 --> 32:06.854
to get through the tunnel.

32:06.939 --> 32:08.379
However,
I need time,

32:08.537 --> 32:10.322
as well as those
guards to move.

32:11.088 --> 32:12.500
You've given me
the easy part.

32:12.901 --> 32:14.635
What? Taylor...

32:14.830 --> 32:17.418
My friend, perhaps if
I had listened to you

32:17.502 --> 32:19.096
and Matty at the start,

32:19.809 --> 32:22.423
I would have realized
Acosta wasn't on the level.

32:22.507 --> 32:23.859
Maybe.

32:23.943 --> 32:27.559
And we wouldn't be fugitives
in NORAD, trying to prevent

32:27.643 --> 32:29.245
the collapse of the
missile defense system.

32:29.329 --> 32:30.431
You can't entirely
blame yourself.

32:30.515 --> 32:32.979
As long as I call the shots,
I can.

32:33.665 --> 32:34.963
Good luck.

32:35.607 --> 32:38.150
Uh, what is your plan?

32:38.760 --> 32:40.588
It's known as
the Leeroy Jenkins.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.124
Leeroy...

32:43.310 --> 32:46.143
Jenkins!

32:46.487 --> 32:48.664
[shouting]

33:09.336 --> 33:11.338
[♪♪]

33:24.102 --> 33:26.673
PACOM and CENTCOM
are not responding.

33:26.758 --> 33:29.017
Major Frost, will you
take us up to DefCon One?

33:29.102 --> 33:31.797
DefCon One. Spool all
missiles in their silos.

33:31.881 --> 33:33.407
<i>- Silo One, go.
- Silo Two, go.</i>

33:33.492 --> 33:34.667
<i>- Silo Three, go.
- Silo Four, go.</i>

33:34.751 --> 33:35.642
Engage backup power.

33:35.727 --> 33:36.979
FEMALE VOICE [over P.A.]:
DefCon One enabled.

33:37.063 --> 33:38.228
Man all stations.

33:38.313 --> 33:40.545
[powering up]

33:40.629 --> 33:42.459
MAN:
Backup power engaged.

33:42.763 --> 33:44.331
[hissing]

33:44.570 --> 33:46.137
MAN:
We are go.

33:50.427 --> 33:52.128
[panicked gasping]

33:52.633 --> 33:54.736
Command center breach!

33:55.032 --> 33:57.387
General Acosta, wait.
Don't you move, MacGyver.

33:57.509 --> 33:59.095
Your family's safe.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.277
[alarm blaring]

34:00.362 --> 34:01.939
Do not plug in that chip.

34:05.981 --> 34:09.103
Just undo the lockdown.

34:09.309 --> 34:11.097
Give 'em a call.
They're safe, I promise.

34:11.181 --> 34:14.376
- That's not a chance I can take.
- What are your orders, sir?

34:18.351 --> 34:20.052
You know what's at stake.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.018
So do I.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.915
Why would I lie to you?

34:33.507 --> 34:35.571
I pray you're telling me
the truth.

34:37.511 --> 34:39.813
[sighs]

34:43.710 --> 34:45.146
[panicked gasping]

35:07.957 --> 35:09.257
No!

35:12.882 --> 35:14.390
Why would you do this?

35:14.843 --> 35:16.421
[alarm continues]

35:18.455 --> 35:20.156
Who do you work for?

35:22.556 --> 35:24.320
I work for everyone.

35:27.736 --> 35:29.566
That's what
Martin Bishop said.

35:30.063 --> 35:31.456
What does it mean?

35:34.362 --> 35:35.407
[man shouts]

35:46.711 --> 35:48.713
[alarm continues]

36:08.151 --> 36:09.676
MATTY:
Acosta will be fine.

36:09.761 --> 36:11.739
But he'll be recovering
from his wounds

36:11.823 --> 36:13.151
in Leavenworth prison.

36:14.104 --> 36:16.576
Seems like a sad end
to a storied career.

36:17.026 --> 36:19.143
He's very grateful
to you, though,

36:19.253 --> 36:21.531
for stopping him
from compromising NORAD.

36:22.042 --> 36:24.128
And to you, Desi and Riley...

36:25.057 --> 36:26.714
for rescuing his family.

36:27.245 --> 36:28.798
MATTY:
His testimony and confession

36:28.883 --> 36:30.066
cleared all of your names.

36:30.151 --> 36:31.808
And thanks to your work
on this op,

36:31.893 --> 36:34.269
once I finish dotting the Is
and crossing the Ts

36:34.354 --> 36:35.737
on your
new background check,

36:36.089 --> 36:38.948
we will get our security
clearances back.

36:40.243 --> 36:42.092
It'll feel good
to be legit again.

36:42.376 --> 36:43.991
Yeah, that's great,
Boze,

36:44.076 --> 36:46.120
but there's still a lot
of unanswered questions.

36:46.205 --> 36:48.038
Yeah, like have we ID'd
the kidnapper?

36:48.123 --> 36:49.930
And what do we know about
the shadowy organization

36:50.014 --> 36:50.804
behind all this?

36:50.889 --> 36:52.694
- And what happened to...?
- TAYLOR: Go home.

36:52.935 --> 36:54.311
Decompress.

36:54.692 --> 36:56.349
Finding the answers
to those questions

36:56.479 --> 36:58.092
is my burden to bear.

37:01.351 --> 37:02.514
Go on.

37:02.623 --> 37:04.420
Bugger off.
Scoot.

37:16.777 --> 37:18.390
Head to my place?

37:18.585 --> 37:19.881
I'm meeting up
with Hannah.

37:19.966 --> 37:21.522
Oh, look at you.

37:21.607 --> 37:24.614
Actually, I got to end it
before it starts, okay?

37:24.821 --> 37:26.739
I told her what I could,
but you guys know

37:26.855 --> 37:29.093
there's a lot of secrets to keep
when you work around here.

37:29.177 --> 37:31.123
And those tend
to catch up to us

37:31.325 --> 37:32.678
sooner or later.

37:33.333 --> 37:34.347
I'm out.

37:34.447 --> 37:35.451
All right, man.

37:35.748 --> 37:37.077
I guess it's just us.

37:37.178 --> 37:38.766
Ah, that's gonna be
a rain check for me, too.

37:38.850 --> 37:40.484
[chuckles]
Matty's got some stuff

37:40.592 --> 37:42.107
for me to finish up in here.

37:43.151 --> 37:44.397
It's him.

37:57.647 --> 37:59.147
[sighs]

38:13.409 --> 38:14.500
[chuckles]

38:15.019 --> 38:16.028
What's with the tiny pies?

38:16.112 --> 38:17.023
I thought we were
going out tonight.

38:17.108 --> 38:18.807
We can't.
There's a...

38:19.987 --> 38:22.027
[whispers]: There's a white
lady in the living room.

38:22.250 --> 38:24.252
I'm, I'm sorry,
there's a what?

38:27.712 --> 38:29.268
That's my boss.

38:29.868 --> 38:33.088
You got to warn me if
we're having guests.

38:34.596 --> 38:35.970
Sorry to just drop in,

38:36.054 --> 38:38.364
but I was in the neighborhood
and thought maybe

38:38.448 --> 38:40.816
you would like
to discuss that thing

38:40.901 --> 38:42.455
you've been meaning
to talk to me about.

38:42.539 --> 38:43.917
Yes, yes, the thing.

38:44.002 --> 38:46.261
Um, babe, could you make
some drinks for us?

38:46.346 --> 38:47.893
Sure. Sure, sure.

38:50.045 --> 38:53.550
Don't worry, he still thinks
you work at a boring think tank.

38:53.635 --> 38:54.722
How much trouble am I in?

38:54.807 --> 38:56.269
For failing
to disclose the fact

38:56.354 --> 38:57.707
that you have
a live-in boyfriend

38:57.792 --> 38:59.317
when you're right
in the middle of getting

38:59.401 --> 39:00.613
your security clearance back?

39:00.698 --> 39:03.252
- I'm in a lot of trouble.
- I vetted him.

39:03.745 --> 39:06.324
Aubrey Jones,
licensed corporate accountant.

39:06.409 --> 39:09.134
No criminal record.
Clean history.

39:09.373 --> 39:10.737
[sighs]

39:10.860 --> 39:13.167
I'm sorry, Matty.
It's fine.

39:13.745 --> 39:16.535
Occasionally scaring the crap
out of your employees

39:16.620 --> 39:18.792
is just good
business management.

39:20.323 --> 39:22.370
Why haven't you shared this
with any of us?

39:22.831 --> 39:24.497
I just wanted to keep
the Phoenix out of it

39:24.581 --> 39:26.081
for as long as I could.

39:26.463 --> 39:28.346
When I'm with him,
I feel like I'm...

39:29.096 --> 39:31.160
more than just the job.

39:32.846 --> 39:34.594
At least that's what
I keep telling myself.

39:34.678 --> 39:36.596
That's what we all
tell ourselves.

39:37.534 --> 39:39.284
Whatever gets you
through the night.

39:52.766 --> 39:54.637
You're here late.

39:55.594 --> 39:56.815
Whoever we're up against,

39:56.930 --> 39:58.438
they're certainly formidable.

39:59.493 --> 40:01.354
And we're no wiser
to their agenda

40:01.439 --> 40:02.967
than we were yesterday.

40:06.665 --> 40:08.447
By choosing Phoenix
as the Red Cell,

40:08.532 --> 40:10.532
they were looking to kill
two birds with one stone.

40:10.969 --> 40:13.978
Neutralize us and
take over NORAD.

40:14.298 --> 40:17.680
Add "clever" and "dangerous"
to the list of superlatives.

40:17.853 --> 40:19.744
Any progress connecting
the dots?

40:19.829 --> 40:21.525
It's what you do,
isn't it?

40:24.517 --> 40:26.863
On both the kidnappers'
and Frost's phones,

40:26.947 --> 40:29.385
we found these encrypted
communications.

40:31.173 --> 40:33.103
It's how every message ended.

40:35.020 --> 40:36.155
What does it mean?

40:36.240 --> 40:38.228
It's a visual trigger;
it reminds them that

40:38.313 --> 40:40.623
they're, they're part
of something bigger,

40:41.118 --> 40:42.946
committed to a cause, but,

40:43.345 --> 40:46.509
but who they are
remains a mystery.
