00:01.523 --> 00:02.785
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:02.828 --> 00:04.787
Oh, hey, Brenda.
What brings you out tonight?

00:04.830 --> 00:06.223
Just needed to get
out of the house.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.224
I hear that.

00:07.268 --> 00:09.009
Want some company?

00:09.052 --> 00:10.662
Sure.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.273
Then what if we go
someplace else?

00:12.316 --> 00:13.752
What do you have in mind?

00:13.796 --> 00:16.103
Herschel does have the kids.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.976
You okay?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.456
George?

00:21.499 --> 00:22.631
Hello?

00:22.674 --> 00:24.198
Mary, it's Brenda.

00:24.241 --> 00:25.329
George is in the hospital.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.678
What's going on?

00:26.722 --> 00:28.289
Paramedics think it might be
his heart.

00:28.332 --> 00:31.466
All we did was have a nice time
in a public place. Hmm?

00:31.509 --> 00:33.642
Now, is there anything
wrong with that?

00:33.685 --> 00:35.252
Kind of feels like it.

00:35.296 --> 00:36.819
It does feel like it.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.473
Why does it feel like it?

00:38.516 --> 00:40.301
Maybe...

00:40.344 --> 00:44.044
'cause it was nice to talk
to someone and feel special.

00:45.175 --> 00:46.829
It was.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.486
<i>Sundays were not
my favorite day. </i>

00:51.529 --> 00:53.531
<i>In fact, the only light
at the end of the tunnel was </i>

00:53.575 --> 00:56.926
<i>the wry musings of Andy Rooney
at the end of 60 Minutes.</i>

00:56.969 --> 00:59.929
Noise is sound
you don't want to hear.

00:59.972 --> 01:04.412
And of course, one person's
sound is another person's noise.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.022
So wry.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.763
<i>The rest of the day was filled
with football, </i>

01:07.806 --> 01:11.245
<i>church and the only school
I didn't enjoy attending, </i>

01:11.288 --> 01:12.855
<i>Sunday school.</i>

01:12.898 --> 01:14.900
And then his mother put
baby Moses in a basket

01:14.944 --> 01:16.511
and sent him down the river.

01:16.554 --> 01:17.990
Why?

01:18.034 --> 01:19.296
Maybe he was crying all night

01:19.340 --> 01:21.037
and his mother and father
needed a break.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.344
And maybe his grandmother was
in town to help out,

01:23.387 --> 01:26.521
but she went to bed early
because she had jet lag

01:26.564 --> 01:28.436
after her flight from Dallas.

01:29.219 --> 01:30.699
She did it
because Pharaoh ordered

01:30.742 --> 01:31.874
all the male babies
to be killed.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.963
- That's really in the Bible?
- Yes.

01:34.006 --> 01:36.531
And Mom won't let me
read Judy Blume.

01:36.574 --> 01:39.186
<i>Sheila the Great
changed my life.</i>

01:39.229 --> 01:40.752
Back to Moses.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.363
He was found
by Pharaoh's daughter

01:42.406 --> 01:44.365
and went on to lead
the Israelites out of Egypt,

01:44.408 --> 01:48.891
because even when you feel lost,
God has a plan for us all.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.849
What was his plan
for the male babies

01:50.893 --> 01:51.894
who didn't get rescued?

01:51.937 --> 01:53.983
It's tough to say.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.724
There was a decree
to throw them in the river.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.204
Innocent babies?

01:57.247 --> 01:58.553
That is not cool.

01:58.596 --> 02:01.077
That was Pharaoh,
that was not God.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.688
But according to you,
it's all part of God's plan.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.865
How do you sleep at night?

02:06.909 --> 02:08.737
Okay, we're gonna revisit
getting me some help

02:08.780 --> 02:09.912
with Sunday school.

02:09.955 --> 02:12.088
I am ready,
willing, and...

02:12.132 --> 02:13.481
Nope.

02:13.524 --> 02:15.178
I want someone who can
really connect with the kids.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.659
But connecting with the kids
is what I do.

02:17.702 --> 02:20.270
What planet are you on?

02:20.314 --> 02:24.448
I'm Miss Mary, and I'll be
your Sunday school teacher.

02:24.492 --> 02:29.236
Oh, no, you won't. I will.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.977
Slithers, that is a lie.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.937
And what's another name
for a lie?

02:34.980 --> 02:38.593
A s-s-sin.

02:38.636 --> 02:41.900
Boy did that s-s-suck.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.773
Fine,
what do you have in mind?

02:44.816 --> 02:46.296
It's time we hire
a youth pastor.

02:46.340 --> 02:49.038
Fresh blood.
I like the sound of that.

02:49.081 --> 02:50.909
I already put in
a call to my buddy

02:50.953 --> 02:52.215
at the Southern Baptist
Convention.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.435
So, this isn't open
for discussion?

02:54.478 --> 02:55.871
It's already happening?

02:55.914 --> 02:57.699
As they say in the rec room
Tuesday nights:

02:57.742 --> 02:59.004
"Bingo!"

02:59.657 --> 03:01.659
S-s-sorry.

03:30.122 --> 03:31.385
Hey, Brenda.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.169
Oh, hey, Connie.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.518
Haven't seen you in a while.

03:34.562 --> 03:35.519
Yeah.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.825
Sounds like you and George

03:36.868 --> 03:38.000
had a crazy night, huh?

03:38.043 --> 03:40.872
What? No, we didn't.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.179
He has a heart attack,
and you get him to the hospital.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.876
That wasn't crazy?

03:44.920 --> 03:46.922
No.

03:46.965 --> 03:50.273
Well, thank God
you were with him.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.928
Well, I-I wouldn't say
I was "with him."

03:52.971 --> 03:54.103
You weren't?

03:54.146 --> 03:56.410
I was there, and he was there,

03:56.453 --> 03:59.326
and other people were there.

03:59.369 --> 04:00.805
Okay.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.198
You know,

04:02.242 --> 04:03.547
I'm just glad that
he's doing better.

04:03.591 --> 04:05.157
Mm. Yeah.

04:06.724 --> 04:07.638
Well, it's good seeing you.

04:07.682 --> 04:08.683
You, too.

04:21.348 --> 04:24.307
You both liked it that day I
taught Sunday school, right?

04:24.351 --> 04:25.787
Ugh, with the snake?

04:25.830 --> 04:26.831
I didn't like it, either.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.137
But I'm critical of most things.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.139
You aren't doing it again,
are you?

04:30.182 --> 04:33.316
No. We're hiring
a youth pastor.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.796
Why?

04:34.839 --> 04:38.495
To help get young kids
excited about God.

04:38.539 --> 04:41.324
The same God who lets babies
- get thrown in rivers?
- What?

04:41.368 --> 04:42.978
We covered Moses
in Sunday school.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.501
Oh.

04:44.545 --> 04:47.287
Well,
that was Old Testament God.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.766
He gets more fun later.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.333
Anyway, Pastor Jeff

04:50.377 --> 04:53.945
is hoping to bring in someone
from the outside to help.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.731
Oh, and you're jealous 'cause
you think you can do it better.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.167
No.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.909
I'm sure whoever we get
will do a wonderful job.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.345
She's jealous.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.347
You know it's bad
when I can see it.

05:07.219 --> 05:09.178
What's up?

05:09.221 --> 05:10.658
My smoke detector's
beeping again.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.442
Have you got
one of those little batteries?

05:12.486 --> 05:14.444
- I think so. Come on in.
- Thank you.

05:14.488 --> 05:17.534
See, I'm three beeps away
from breaking out my shotgun.

05:17.578 --> 05:20.494
I don't even put
batteries in ours anymore.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.670
Do not tell Sheldon.

05:22.713 --> 05:25.586
I saw Brenda at
the grocery today.

05:25.629 --> 05:26.891
Oh, yeah?

05:26.935 --> 05:28.284
How's she doing?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.938
I don't know.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.331
Something going on
with her?

05:31.374 --> 05:33.028
What do you mean?

05:33.071 --> 05:35.030
I was just talking about what
happened to y'all at the bar,

05:35.073 --> 05:37.293
and she kind of got weird.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.382
Weird how?

05:39.426 --> 05:41.384
What'd she say?

05:41.428 --> 05:43.604
Well, it's not so much
what she said.

05:43.647 --> 05:46.171
Just kind of a vibe I got.

05:46.215 --> 05:49.349
Well, maybe you made her
uncomfortable. You do have

05:49.392 --> 05:50.437
that effect on people.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.742
I didn't do anything.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.788
I was just being neighborly.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.572
Found it. Here we go.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.835
Hey, anything else?

05:58.358 --> 05:59.489
No.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.099
Well, see you.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.320
See you.

06:08.672 --> 06:09.978
Hello?

06:10.021 --> 06:11.327
What did you tell Connie?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.546
- What do you mean?
- GEORGE SR.:
She said

06:12.589 --> 06:13.764
she saw you
at the grocery store,

06:13.808 --> 06:14.852
and you were acting weird.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.376
She caught me off guard.

06:16.419 --> 06:19.248
She was asking questions
about us hanging out at the bar.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.729
- What did you tell her?
- Nothing.

06:21.772 --> 06:24.079
Well, whatever you said's
got her sniffing around me

06:24.122 --> 06:25.385
like a hound dog
after a polecat.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.430
A hound dog after a polecat?

06:27.474 --> 06:29.432
When I get nervous,
I get extra country.

06:29.476 --> 06:32.087
Did you get country
- in front of her?
- No.

06:32.130 --> 06:34.655
- So you played it cool.
- No.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.221
So, we got to get
our stories straight.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.223
Now, wh-what did you tell her?

06:38.267 --> 06:39.877
I told her we weren't together.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.923
I was there, and you were there,

06:41.966 --> 06:43.228
and other people
were there, too.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.100
That's good. That's good.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.275
So, what did you tell her?

06:46.318 --> 06:47.798
I was a little rude

06:47.842 --> 06:48.930
and rushed her out of the house.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.106
Don't you do that all the time?

06:51.149 --> 06:53.587
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I guess we're okay.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.423
I drew up a list
of interview questions

07:03.466 --> 07:05.468
we can ask the pastors.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.644
But these are all softballs.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.167
Shouldn't we dig
a little deeper?

07:09.211 --> 07:10.386
Are you kidding me?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.040
"Who's your favorite apostle
and why"

07:12.083 --> 07:13.824
is gonna have them squirming
in their seat.

07:13.868 --> 07:16.479
Oh, please, there are
11 good answers and one bad one.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.829
Mary,
if you're not here to help,

07:18.873 --> 07:20.178
I can do this on my own.

07:20.222 --> 07:22.224
I am here to help.
I am just saying

07:22.267 --> 07:24.922
that most people see this job
as a stepping stone

07:24.966 --> 07:26.054
to bigger and better oppor...

07:26.097 --> 07:27.534
This is Pastor Andy.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.579
- Hi, there.
- Welcome.

07:29.623 --> 07:32.887
Who is my favorite apostle
and why? That is a toughie.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.064
Although, I suppose any answer

07:36.107 --> 07:37.631
other than Judas is safe.

07:42.244 --> 07:43.506
So, where you from?

07:43.550 --> 07:44.986
Originally Rhode Island.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.075
And you're
a Southern Baptist?

07:47.118 --> 07:49.469
I guess
I'm more of a Northern Baptist,

07:49.512 --> 07:52.776
but we're all just Baptists,
right?

07:52.820 --> 07:54.082
I'll show him out.

07:54.125 --> 07:58.956
So, how do you relate
to young people?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.958
Bad.

08:01.002 --> 08:04.309
Which is what kids these days
say when they mean "good."

08:04.353 --> 08:07.878
It's a Michael Jackson song.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.534
Here's another Michael
Jackson song: beat it.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.883
- Peg.
- Sorry.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.495
But she's right.
Thank you for coming.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.805
Can I ask you a question?

08:21.849 --> 08:22.719
Mm.

08:22.763 --> 08:25.026
Do you have
any women friends?

08:25.069 --> 08:26.331
Uh-oh.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.508
Mary finally wise up
and kick you to the curb?

08:28.551 --> 08:29.639
I'm being serious.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.206
I have plenty of women friends.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.774
Matter of fact,
my best friend's a woman.

08:33.817 --> 08:34.992
Are you gonna say your wife?

08:35.036 --> 08:35.993
You know I am.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.647
She got in the shower

08:37.691 --> 08:38.735
with me this morning.

08:38.779 --> 08:39.997
I don't need to hear that.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.433
How could something
be so clean

08:41.477 --> 08:43.827
and so dirty at
the same time?

08:43.871 --> 08:45.655
I'm sorry I asked.

08:45.699 --> 08:48.571
Are you upset 'cause I said
she was my best friend

08:48.615 --> 08:50.007
and not you?

08:50.051 --> 08:51.182
No.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.183
You're in the top three.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.402
Stop talking to me.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.535
Definitely my best
white friend.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.668
Okay.

08:58.712 --> 09:01.541
Who is your favorite apostle
and why?

09:01.584 --> 09:03.543
Ooh.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.457
I'm-a say Judas.

09:05.501 --> 09:06.720
What? How?

09:06.763 --> 09:08.896
Well, for man to be redeemed,

09:08.939 --> 09:10.854
our Lord had to die.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.029
If Judas

09:12.073 --> 09:13.204
hadn't betrayed him,

09:13.248 --> 09:15.685
mankind
wouldn't have been saved.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.382
Pretty cool.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.820
I never thought
about it like that.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.039
Well, you know, when you come at
things from unexpected angles,

09:22.083 --> 09:23.388
people pay attention more.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.565
It's what I hope to do
with the kids.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.392
Well, you got my attention.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.090
Hold on. I'm not sure

09:29.133 --> 09:32.963
that we should be teaching
the kids that Judas was cool.

09:33.007 --> 09:36.010
Well, I just try to see everyone
the way Jesus would.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.011
Preach.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.578
No, no, that's your job.

09:38.621 --> 09:42.494
Look, I just want to get
the kids excited about church.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.323
Think of me as the warm-up band

09:45.367 --> 09:46.934
before you hit the stage.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.023
I think we just found
our new youth pastor.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.242
Can we discuss this?

09:51.286 --> 09:53.462
Of course. When can you start?

10:00.164 --> 10:02.427
Why are you watching <i>
The Ten Commandments?</i>

10:02.471 --> 10:04.995
I've just been thinking
- about God.
- Why?

10:05.039 --> 10:07.258
I don't understand how a God
that's supposed to be good

10:07.302 --> 10:09.260
lets such bad things happen.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.958
Oh.

10:11.001 --> 10:13.874
Hmm. Can you think about it
while I watch <i>Yo! MTV Raps?</i>

10:13.917 --> 10:15.440
- Sure.
- Dope.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.621
Do you believe in God?

10:21.664 --> 10:23.666
- Yeah.
- But in the Bible,

10:23.710 --> 10:24.928
he does all kinds
of mean stuff.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.756
If he's good,
why would he do that?

10:26.800 --> 10:29.454
Maybe he just wants to
show he's in charge.

10:29.498 --> 10:30.847
Hulk Hogan's nice,

10:30.891 --> 10:33.937
but in the ring, he
will mess you up.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.940
That's either really smart
or really stupid.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.638
That's what I do.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.162
Do you ever wonder
if it's all made-up?

10:41.205 --> 10:42.990
Look, this is Texas.

10:43.033 --> 10:45.819
We like football.
We like God.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.517
And beef. Beef's
up there, too.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.171
But how do you know
there's a God?

10:50.214 --> 10:52.826
See that girl dancing
in them shorts?

10:54.741 --> 10:56.220
There's a God.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.528
Excuse me? Pastor Rob.

11:01.269 --> 11:04.098
I'm sorry if I came off
a little strong back there.

11:04.141 --> 11:07.231
Oh. Hey, you're just trying
to do what's best for the kids.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.711
I respect that.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.757
Thank you.
And I just want you to know

11:10.800 --> 11:13.063
that I am very well-connected
with the parents,

11:13.107 --> 11:15.544
so if I can be
of any help there,

11:15.587 --> 11:16.763
please let me know.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.721
Yeah, you know, actually,

11:18.765 --> 11:20.854
I try not to get too close
to the parents.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.247
I-I just think it's important
for the kids to feel

11:23.291 --> 11:24.553
like I'm on their side.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.163
Okay.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.425
Ooh, maybe we could do a, uh,

11:27.469 --> 11:29.340
"good cop, bad cop"
sort of thing.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.691
Why am I the bad cop?

11:31.734 --> 11:33.388
Oh, I don't have
all the answers.

11:33.431 --> 11:34.781
Maybe you should ask God.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.957
Really looking forward
to working with you.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.838
Got a minute?

11:48.882 --> 11:50.405
I'm kind of busy. I'm inventing

11:50.448 --> 11:52.712
a system of heraldry
for two warring tribes of orcs

11:52.755 --> 11:54.061
in my D&D campaign.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.585
Oh. I was hoping
we could talk about atheism.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.979
Much like an orc, I'm all ears.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.155
What's it like
to not believe in God?

12:01.198 --> 12:02.896
It's great. Big fan.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.419
Are you ever afraid
you're wrong?

12:04.462 --> 12:06.334
About religion? Never.

12:06.377 --> 12:08.728
About other things? Also never.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.730
I don't know.
It seems a little scary

12:10.773 --> 12:11.818
to just stop believing.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.254
Well, is it more comforting

12:13.297 --> 12:14.777
to believe in a God
who could flood the world

12:14.821 --> 12:16.518
and kill everyone
because he had a bad day?

12:16.561 --> 12:18.825
That's a good point.
But doesn't it

12:18.868 --> 12:20.609
upset people
when you say you don't believe?

12:20.652 --> 12:21.741
Oh, yeah.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.133
And that doesn't bother you?

12:23.177 --> 12:25.309
Does it bother <i>you
when you upset people?</i>

12:25.353 --> 12:26.746
I couldn't care less.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.095
Welcome to atheism.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.750
Now, if you were an orc,
would you like this flag?

12:33.535 --> 12:35.798
Hey, Connie. Usual?

12:35.842 --> 12:37.669
Yeah.

12:41.673 --> 12:44.633
I spend a lot of money here,
right?

12:44.676 --> 12:47.288
You sure do.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.116
So if my son-in-law

12:49.159 --> 12:51.858
was in here
doing something stupid,

12:51.901 --> 12:54.991
I should know, right?

12:55.035 --> 12:56.514
I guess.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.952
Before he went to the hospital,

12:58.995 --> 13:02.999
was he in here
doing something stupid?

13:03.826 --> 13:05.828
Just hanging out.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.830
- Why?
- No reason.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.790
Just watching
too many soap operas, I guess.

13:12.008 --> 13:15.142
Let's just keep this
between us, okay?

13:16.143 --> 13:17.448
Sure thing.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.624
Hello?

13:19.668 --> 13:21.322
Hey, George.
It's Nick from the bar.

13:21.365 --> 13:25.108
Why the hell are you asking
questions about me at the bar?

13:25.152 --> 13:27.328
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.590
Nick told me everything.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.026
Well, clearly, I was lying.

13:36.903 --> 13:37.991
You want to accuse me
of something,

13:38.034 --> 13:40.080
- say it to my face.
- All right, fine.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.472
You have a fight with your wife,

13:41.516 --> 13:42.734
you end up in a bar
with Brenda Sparks,

13:42.778 --> 13:45.215
and now you're both acting weird
about it.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.782
There's no story.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.437
We're two people who went
to the same bar. That's it.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.569
That better be it.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.354
Connie, I get it.
You're protecting

13:53.397 --> 13:54.398
your daughter, but hear me

13:54.442 --> 13:57.401
when I say nothing happened.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.535
Okay.

14:00.578 --> 14:03.755
And I don't appreciate you
snooping around behind my back.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.105
You're absolutely right.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.542
I was wrong to do that.
I'm very sorry.

14:07.585 --> 14:11.285
Little ticked at Nick
for blabbing about it, but...

14:12.460 --> 14:14.418
I'm-I'm sorry.

14:14.462 --> 14:15.942
Thank you.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.900
We good?

14:17.944 --> 14:19.902
We're good.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.432
"We're good" my ass.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.481
All right, you two,
get ready for bed.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.396
- Church in the morning.
- I'm not going.

14:35.439 --> 14:36.571
What do you mean,
you're not going?

14:36.614 --> 14:38.399
I don't think
I believe in God anymore.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.009
What did you do to her?

14:40.053 --> 14:42.664
Hey, she came to me. I mean,
I took the ball and ran with it.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.840
Look at you with
a sports analogy.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.016
We're both evolving.
Ooh, evolution.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.757
Another thing
I'll teach you about.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.628
I don't care what you believe.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.413
You are going
to church tomorrow.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.414
I don't want to.

14:53.457 --> 14:54.415
It might be fun.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.025
The new youth pastor's starting.

14:56.069 --> 14:58.245
- So?
- We can attack
his belief system together.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.334
Like the Wonder Twins
of atheism.

15:00.377 --> 15:02.075
See? Your brother's excited.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.555
You just want the new guy
to have a bad day.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.602
I can want two things.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.519
Well, hey, y'all.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.390
I'm Pastor Rob.

15:13.434 --> 15:16.741
I'm, uh, guessing
everyone knows what this is.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.918
- The Bible.
- That's right. That's right.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.397
What else is it?

15:20.441 --> 15:21.572
The word of God.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.444
Excellent. Excellent.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.142
You know what else it is?

15:31.800 --> 15:32.888
It's just a book.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.411
I like him.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.936
It's a good book.
Got lot of great stories.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.763
Instructions
on how to live life.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.156
But...

15:40.200 --> 15:44.813
God is more than just a book.

15:44.856 --> 15:47.337
God is real.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.426
God is everywhere.

15:49.470 --> 15:53.953
And God loves you.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.346
He's losing me.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.742
It ain't pretty,
but it's private.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.265
So,

16:02.309 --> 16:03.266
what's up?

16:03.310 --> 16:05.138
Now, don't freak out,

16:05.181 --> 16:07.792
but Connie was at the bar
asking questions.

16:07.836 --> 16:08.793
What the hell?

16:08.837 --> 16:10.099
It's fine. I handled it.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.535
We're all good.

16:11.579 --> 16:12.623
Well, I hope so.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.016
We are.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.800
But I think we
probably shouldn't go to the bar

16:15.844 --> 16:17.193
at the same time for a while.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.239
Okay. You stay home. I'll go.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.415
Why me? That's where I hang out.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.503
I'm single.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.722
Who am I gonna meet
sitting at home?

16:24.766 --> 16:27.334
I don't know. Mailman? Plumber?

16:28.291 --> 16:30.119
I've seen a movie
where the pizza delivery boy

16:30.163 --> 16:32.817
does pretty well for himself.

16:34.428 --> 16:37.474
Yeah, I bounced around
from job to job after college.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.520
Never really had a plan
for what was next

16:39.563 --> 16:44.003
until one day, I felt the Lord
call me to his service.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.092
Yes, Missy Cooper.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.137
- Right?
- How'd you know?

16:48.181 --> 16:50.487
Let's see, Mary's your mother,
Sheldon's your brother,

16:50.531 --> 16:53.186
and I hear
you are one heck of a pitcher.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.364
I do my homework, y'all.
Homework. He's winning me back.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.061
So, what's on your mind, Missy?

16:59.105 --> 17:01.107
Is it okay that I'm wondering
if God is real?

17:01.150 --> 17:02.369
I can take this one.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.326
Yes.

17:03.370 --> 17:06.721
He is absolutely right.

17:06.764 --> 17:08.549
- He is?
- I usually am.

17:08.592 --> 17:11.769
Can't just believe something
because people say it's true.

17:11.813 --> 17:13.336
You have to question it.

17:13.380 --> 17:16.600
It's kind of like the, uh,
the scientific method,

17:16.644 --> 17:17.732
right, Sheldon?

17:17.775 --> 17:19.038
Did my homework on you, too.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.301
But what if I decide
he's not real?

17:21.344 --> 17:24.391
Look, I'm not asking you
to believe what I believe.

17:24.434 --> 17:27.698
I'm just asking you to think
about what you believe.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.919
Sounds like you're
already doing that.

17:32.007 --> 17:34.531
- Yep.
- What do you know about me?

17:34.575 --> 17:36.533
Hmm. Billy Sparks.

17:36.577 --> 17:37.969
Sixth grade.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.755
Also plays baseball,
but maybe not as good as her.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.539
Whoa.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.237
And then Pastor Rob
said it doesn't matter

17:44.280 --> 17:46.587
if I believe in God
'cause God believes in me.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.328
I said the same thing.

17:48.371 --> 17:49.590
Not like he did.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.113
Well, I told him

17:51.157 --> 17:52.767
religion isn't objective
and there's no proof for it.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.899
Oh, I bet he didn't like that.

17:54.943 --> 17:55.987
He loved it.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.554
He quoted Kierkegaard
and said

17:57.598 --> 17:59.774
if you could prove it,
there'd be no room for faith.

18:00.731 --> 18:03.343
Oh. Well, good for him.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.258
- He also likes homework.
- Mm-hmm.

18:05.301 --> 18:06.955
<i>
He even threw the Bible
on the floor. </i>

18:06.998 --> 18:08.087
<i>
- He what?
-- You heard me. </i>

18:13.527 --> 18:15.006
When you were married,
would you have said

18:15.050 --> 18:16.834
that Herschel
was your best friend?

18:16.878 --> 18:19.837
What married person
would say that?

18:19.881 --> 18:21.143
My buddy Wayne.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.102
Does this buddy of yours
have kids?

18:23.145 --> 18:25.104
- No.
- Then what the hell
does he know?

18:25.147 --> 18:27.410
He's a very happy guy.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.151
It's exhausting.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.588
Ooh, I should get going.

18:31.632 --> 18:32.850
Okay.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.114
You want to take a chicken
for the smoker?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.116
Do I look like a vegetarian?

18:37.159 --> 18:38.856
Mom?

18:38.900 --> 18:41.250
- You out here?
- Um, I'll-I'll be there

18:41.294 --> 18:44.645
in a sec, honey. I'm-I'm
just feeding the chickens.
