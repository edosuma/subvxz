00:01.805 --> 00:04.365
<i>Seven years ago, I was
recruited to work for SD-6,</i>

00:04.474 --> 00:06.909
<i>which I was told
was a covert branch of the CIA.</i>

00:06.910 --> 00:08.711
<i>I was trained as a spy,</i>

00:08.712 --> 00:11.212
<i>warned not to tell anyone
what I did.</i>

00:11.214 --> 00:13.215
<i>I thought I was working
for the good guys,</i>

00:13.216 --> 00:16.184
<i>until I told my fiancé
about SD-6</i>

00:16.253 --> 00:17.386
<i>and they had him killed.</i>

00:17.387 --> 00:18.988
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:18.989 --> 00:22.117
<i>That SD-6 is part of the very
enemy I thought I was fighting.</i>

00:22.192 --> 00:23.759
<i>Now I'm a double agent,</i>

00:23.760 --> 00:26.661
<i>working with the real CIA
to bring down SD-6,</i>

00:26.730 --> 00:28.731
<i>where my only ally
is another double agent,</i>

00:28.732 --> 00:30.499
<i>a man I hardly know.</i>

00:30.500 --> 00:33.000
<i>My father.</i>

00:50.287 --> 00:53.313
Arrêtez! Arrêtez!

02:06.630 --> 02:09.130
Arrêtez! Arrêtez!

02:38.228 --> 02:39.762
That was three years ago,

02:39.763 --> 02:41.597
when I met him
for the first time.

02:41.598 --> 02:45.591
Leonard Dreyfus. He helps
bankroll SD-6 operations.

02:45.669 --> 02:49.469
This guy is very hands-on,
not just in his business.

02:49.539 --> 02:51.207
He's a real slime.

02:51.208 --> 02:54.177
He runs a division in Geneva.
Go-to guy for transport.

02:54.244 --> 02:55.978
He'll get anything anywhere
fast.

02:55.979 --> 02:58.479
Sloane relies on him.
He's a big target.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.449
Also, there's a crew
just outside Memphis.

03:00.450 --> 03:02.318
They provide firearms,
custom stuff.

03:02.319 --> 03:03.686
Graphite, titanium, plastics.

03:03.687 --> 03:05.254
- Memphis?
- Memphis, Egypt.

03:05.255 --> 03:07.356
I know I just started working
with you guys at the CIA,

03:07.357 --> 03:08.457
but listen to me.

03:08.458 --> 03:09.892
If we're gonna bring down SD-6,

03:09.893 --> 03:12.987
we have to eliminate their
source of arms, Ineni Hassan.

03:13.063 --> 03:15.563
Three of her majesty's favorite.

03:21.805 --> 03:24.501
And now the new design,
as I promised.

03:26.143 --> 03:27.810
I named it "Abenni."

03:27.811 --> 03:29.445
That's my son's name.

03:29.446 --> 03:32.609
It holds 12 rounds.
It's semiautomatic.

03:41.758 --> 03:43.759
What the hell is this?

04:02.279 --> 04:04.779
No!

04:14.591 --> 04:17.151
That was... Uh, sorry.

04:20.363 --> 04:22.565
I am sorry you had to see that.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.333
That was six months ago.

04:24.334 --> 04:25.801
I have friends
from the Middle East.

04:25.802 --> 04:28.103
Hassan's not one of them.

04:28.104 --> 04:29.872
I don't blame you.

04:29.873 --> 04:32.842
We need to go after a geneticist
in Kuala Lumpur.

04:32.909 --> 04:34.643
- He was involved in...
- Okay, stop.

04:34.644 --> 04:36.245
You have to listen
to me now, okay?

04:36.246 --> 04:37.613
You said you wanted
to talk about the plan.

04:37.614 --> 04:38.614
I'm giving you the plan.

04:38.615 --> 04:41.050
It's not your job.
I'm giving you the plan.

04:41.051 --> 04:42.785
Tomorrow's your first day
back at SD-6.

04:42.786 --> 04:44.420
Nothing should change.

04:44.421 --> 04:45.788
When you get your assignment,

04:45.789 --> 04:47.723
you'll detail your mission
on a paper bag.

04:47.724 --> 04:48.958
Bag.

04:48.959 --> 04:51.093
Then you'll call this number.
Memorize it.

04:51.094 --> 04:53.790
After three tones, press the
appropriate digit, 1 through 6.

04:53.864 --> 04:56.799
Each corresponds to a trash can
in a specific location.

04:56.867 --> 04:59.068
We'll dead-drop,
review your information,

04:59.069 --> 05:00.369
create a countermission,

05:00.370 --> 05:02.171
and contact you
posing as a wrong number,

05:02.172 --> 05:03.739
Joey's Pizza.

05:03.740 --> 05:04.940
Any questions?

05:04.941 --> 05:07.441
Yeah. Can you show me
what a bag looks like again?

05:07.510 --> 05:09.845
Now, you listen to me,
Mr. Vaughn...

05:09.846 --> 05:11.680
I appreciate
what your job is here...

05:11.681 --> 05:13.382
even though I think
you're a little young...

05:13.383 --> 05:14.416
To establish a protocol

05:14.417 --> 05:16.685
between the CIA
and their latest double agent.

05:16.686 --> 05:18.687
But I am not sitting here
to pick up the ins and outs

05:18.688 --> 05:20.155
of Langley procedure.

05:20.156 --> 05:21.557
I am sitting here
for one reason only.

05:21.558 --> 05:24.959
To destroy SD-6,
after which I am out.

05:25.028 --> 05:26.829
I want no more
of this spy crap.

05:26.830 --> 05:28.397
That's why I went to you
in the first place.

05:28.398 --> 05:30.099
So listen to me,

05:30.100 --> 05:32.468
and I will hand you,
in record time,

05:32.469 --> 05:35.632
the people who will render
SD-6 useless.

05:35.705 --> 05:37.740
Record time?

05:37.741 --> 05:40.369
Two months tops,
and then I am out. I walk.

05:46.983 --> 05:48.651
Draw me a map.

05:48.652 --> 05:51.086
Draw me a map of SD-6,

05:51.087 --> 05:54.250
all its allies,
how far you think it reaches.

05:54.324 --> 05:56.125
Do I look like
I'm in junior high?

05:56.126 --> 05:58.193
- Are there braces on my teeth?
- Draw an SD-6 family tree.

05:58.194 --> 06:00.694
- Do you see a retainer?!
- Just do it!

06:29.459 --> 06:31.260
I don't know what
your problem is with me.

06:31.261 --> 06:32.328
Maybe it's that I'm a woman,

06:32.329 --> 06:35.025
or you don't like
my attitude or something.

06:35.098 --> 06:36.298
I am sorry about that.

06:36.299 --> 06:39.359
I really don't feel like
wasting time here.

06:39.436 --> 06:41.704
There is only one way
we're gonna immobilize SD-6,

06:41.705 --> 06:43.839
and that's my way.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.638
So forgive me for being
forthright or female,

06:46.743 --> 06:50.076
but this is how it's gonna be.

07:24.848 --> 07:28.215
Since I've been at the CIA,
I've only seen this map grow.

07:28.284 --> 07:30.319
This is what you're in
the middle of.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.050
If shutting down the Los Angeles
cell is all we were after,

07:33.123 --> 07:35.190
we would have raided
that office three years ago.

07:35.191 --> 07:38.456
This is not about cutting off
an arm of the monster.

07:38.528 --> 07:41.122
This is about killing
the monster.

07:41.197 --> 07:43.065
And the work you have
ahead of you...

07:43.066 --> 07:43.899
the work your father's
been doing.

07:43.900 --> 07:46.400
It's complicated.
It's political.

07:46.469 --> 07:48.969
It is long-term.

07:55.478 --> 07:57.880
- Here, memorize this.
- I did.

07:57.881 --> 08:00.577
Okay. Well, I guess
we'll wait to hear from you.

08:02.318 --> 08:04.818
Hey, wait.

08:16.866 --> 08:19.366
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

08:31.714 --> 08:33.115
Hey, see you in class.

08:33.116 --> 08:35.616
For sure.

09:18.661 --> 09:20.796
Oh, look. This one's chipped.

09:20.797 --> 09:22.364
Oh, that's okay.

09:22.365 --> 09:24.099
Those were my mom's.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.501
Oh.

09:25.502 --> 09:26.735
Okay.

09:26.736 --> 09:27.970
These are heavy.

09:27.971 --> 09:29.138
Oh.

09:29.139 --> 09:33.132
Put those down right here.

09:33.243 --> 09:35.743
No problem.

09:35.778 --> 09:37.279
Thank you.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.581
Como sí.

09:39.582 --> 09:40.983
I need a massage later.

09:40.984 --> 09:43.352
Okay. Good to know.

09:43.353 --> 09:45.187
- Hey, finally.
- I know. I'm sorry.

09:45.188 --> 09:47.523
Litvack called, and I had to
rewrite a whole piece

09:47.524 --> 09:48.524
in the parking lot.

09:48.525 --> 09:50.659
- They didn't have horseradish.
- That's cool.

09:50.660 --> 09:52.427
- That's annoying.
- No kidding.

09:52.428 --> 09:53.629
There's a woman
in Marina Del Rey

09:53.630 --> 09:54.630
who's eating newspaper.

09:54.631 --> 09:56.265
- Eating it?
- She's pregnant.

09:56.266 --> 09:58.667
It's a condition
that some women get.

09:58.668 --> 09:59.968
Eating newspaper's a condition?

09:59.969 --> 10:01.537
This is what I write about.

10:01.538 --> 10:02.938
This is how I make a living.

10:02.939 --> 10:05.274
And Litvack says
my writing's too judgmental.

10:05.275 --> 10:06.575
I'm like, "Who cares?

10:06.576 --> 10:08.677
She's not gonna read it.
She's gonna swallow it."

10:08.678 --> 10:10.112
What are you doing Thursday?

10:10.113 --> 10:11.647
Rewriting this piece.

10:11.648 --> 10:14.148
Charlie got an offer.

10:15.185 --> 10:17.286
Hey, that's great! Where?

10:17.287 --> 10:18.854
Fleming Letterman.

10:18.855 --> 10:20.989
That's corporate law,
downtown office.

10:20.990 --> 10:22.090
Yeah, I heard of that.

10:22.091 --> 10:24.359
We're doing dinner on Thursday.
You are required.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.860
I'm totally there.
Congratulations.

10:37.507 --> 10:41.307
Hey. Do you want your food?

10:41.411 --> 10:43.545
Yeah, I just want to get
the closets done first

10:43.546 --> 10:46.046
so I feel like I live here.

10:46.049 --> 10:48.549
Well, here.

10:49.018 --> 10:51.518
Thanks.

11:02.065 --> 11:03.332
I'm sorry. I can't take it.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.667
Oh, Will, please,
let's not do this again.

11:05.668 --> 11:06.868
You know that I can't
let this go.

11:06.869 --> 11:09.702
You took Amy's passport.
You took her credit card.

11:09.772 --> 11:11.373
- I know what happened.
- You disappeared.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.020
It's the bank.

11:28.091 --> 11:30.591
What was going on with Danny?

11:30.627 --> 11:33.095
- I need you to do something.
- You need me to shut up.

11:33.096 --> 11:34.563
I need you to accept
what I've already told you.

11:34.564 --> 11:36.298
You haven't told me anything.

11:36.299 --> 11:38.667
I lost my mind a little.
I started imagining things.

11:38.668 --> 11:40.402
Maybe you're not imagining it.

11:40.403 --> 11:41.803
This is what I do.

11:41.804 --> 11:43.939
I might be able to find
something the police overlooked.

11:43.940 --> 11:46.440
Stop it.

11:47.410 --> 11:49.378
Please.

11:49.379 --> 11:51.879
I'm trying to move on here.

11:53.149 --> 11:55.649
I need your help to do that.

11:59.522 --> 12:02.022
Okay?

12:38.861 --> 12:41.296
- Oh, uh, Miss Bristow.
- Hey, Marshall.

12:41.297 --> 12:43.498
Hey. Uh, listen, I don't
normally get overly personal.

12:43.499 --> 12:44.833
I don't like to cross that line.

12:44.834 --> 12:46.501
You probably
don't know this about me.

12:46.502 --> 12:48.370
I'm really not much
of a social person.

12:48.371 --> 12:50.238
I don't... I like myself.

12:50.239 --> 12:51.807
I enjoy myself.

12:51.808 --> 12:55.005
I don't feel that kind of
pressure when I'm by my...

12:55.111 --> 12:56.878
Did you ever feel that?

12:56.879 --> 12:59.379
You can say
anything you want to me.

13:00.016 --> 13:01.850
Okay, I just wanted to tell you

13:01.851 --> 13:04.351
that I'm really sorry
about your fiancé

13:04.354 --> 13:06.914
and it's nice
to have you back.

13:09.726 --> 13:12.226
Thanks.

13:17.700 --> 13:19.000
Let's start with what we know.

13:19.001 --> 13:21.403
We've received
two pieces of intel.

13:21.404 --> 13:24.931
The first is this internal memo
from G.R.U. Headquarters.

13:25.041 --> 13:28.067
It seems that certain files
were reported missing last week

13:28.177 --> 13:30.412
from the seventh floor
of the aquarium.

13:30.413 --> 13:32.247
Seventh floor?
That's foreign intelligence.

13:32.248 --> 13:33.615
Then we acquired
the second piece.

13:33.616 --> 13:37.074
Abul Hassein Navour,
military attaché from Sudan

13:37.153 --> 13:39.653
whom you'll fondly remember
from last year.

13:39.689 --> 13:42.385
He's on his way to Moscow
to meet these two gentlemen.

13:42.458 --> 13:46.053
Kazimirets Chebekov
and Luri Kapochev.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.430
Both I.D.'d as members
of the Russian Mafia.

13:48.431 --> 13:50.931
We think these are the men
who stole the documents.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.060
The codes indicated in the memo
that these lost documents

13:54.137 --> 13:56.697
pertained to the Soviet-American
nuclear arsenal

13:56.773 --> 13:57.806
during the Cold War.

13:57.807 --> 14:00.674
Navour's buying 20-year-old
intelligence records. Why?

14:00.743 --> 14:02.611
That's the part we don't know.

14:02.612 --> 14:05.046
So you are leaving
tomorrow morning.

14:05.047 --> 14:07.349
Your job is to prevent
the transaction

14:07.350 --> 14:09.017
and retrieve the stolen files.

14:09.018 --> 14:11.420
Marshall, tell us what you got.

14:11.421 --> 14:15.983
Okay. Who here has trouble
falling asleep at night? Hmm?

14:18.728 --> 14:22.994
Okay. Well, on occasion,
I find it difficult.

14:23.065 --> 14:24.266
Mind racing, ideas, et cetera.

14:24.267 --> 14:27.759
So this kind of pertains
to the whole sleeping thing.

14:27.837 --> 14:30.305
Now, I created this
just for Navour.

14:30.306 --> 14:33.673
You just take this little kind
of round thing here.

14:33.776 --> 14:35.143
It's pretty cool.

14:35.144 --> 14:37.312
Just touch it
with your finger, your hand.

14:37.313 --> 14:38.747
Just, you know,
barely touch it.

14:38.748 --> 14:40.649
You're knocked out completely.

14:40.650 --> 14:43.380
It's like freebasing Thorazine.
Boom.

14:43.453 --> 14:45.220
Now, you only get two times
on this thing.

14:45.221 --> 14:46.388
It only works twice.

14:46.389 --> 14:49.017
So you don't want to use it
three times, 'cause...

14:49.091 --> 14:50.525
Do we need to wear those gloves?

14:50.526 --> 14:51.693
Oh, no. No, I, uh...

14:51.694 --> 14:54.788
We can make you a nice, uh, ring
or, um, you know,

14:54.864 --> 14:56.298
perhaps an attractive
cuff link.

14:56.299 --> 14:57.699
The reason why I'm wearing
the gloves.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.367
I accidentally touched this
the other day.

14:59.368 --> 15:00.902
I fell and knocked my head
on the desk

15:00.903 --> 15:02.737
and was out cold for 20 minutes.

15:02.738 --> 15:05.798
You guys should see the...
That's not, um...

15:05.908 --> 15:08.408
I'm trying to be kind of
Pavlovian about these puppies.

15:08.511 --> 15:11.011
No pun intended.

15:11.581 --> 15:12.747
They keep coming back,
don't they?

15:12.748 --> 15:14.115
Who? You mean Navour?

15:14.116 --> 15:16.051
How is that man
still able to walk?

15:16.052 --> 15:18.220
If it weren't him,
it'd be someone else.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.955
Then let it be someone else.

15:19.956 --> 15:21.623
We kill ourselves
to do the right thing.

15:21.624 --> 15:24.124
Meanwhile, the bad people
keep coming back.

15:25.495 --> 15:27.329
Sydney, do you have a minute?

15:27.330 --> 15:28.463
Yes, of course.

15:28.464 --> 15:30.098
I'll be in tech ops.

15:30.099 --> 15:33.034
I know it's gonna take you some
time to adjust to being back.

15:33.102 --> 15:35.170
I just want to make sure
you're all right.

15:35.171 --> 15:36.705
I'm fine. Thanks.

15:36.706 --> 15:40.164
Good.
I need to show you something.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.750
I'll leave you two alone.

15:57.627 --> 15:59.127
It's all right.
The room's clean.

15:59.128 --> 16:01.628
No one's listening.

16:01.631 --> 16:02.764
Hello, Sydney.

16:02.765 --> 16:04.165
What is this?

16:04.166 --> 16:06.501
I'm here to tell you
what you already know.

16:06.502 --> 16:09.027
That I work for SD-6,
or so they think.

16:09.105 --> 16:10.639
- I asked Sloane to do this.
- Why?

16:10.640 --> 16:13.700
Because it'll facilitate
what we're doing

16:13.809 --> 16:16.309
if they know that you know.

16:18.881 --> 16:21.975
It wouldn't hurt if you acted
surprised when you left.

16:35.298 --> 16:39.598
Since I've known the truth
about you...

16:39.669 --> 16:43.833
I've asked myself questions,
thousands of questions.

16:45.741 --> 16:48.437
But this one,
I have to ask you now.

16:51.514 --> 16:54.108
When Danny was killed...

16:57.053 --> 17:00.784
Dad, did you know...

17:04.926 --> 17:07.487
Did you know that's what
they were going to do?

17:11.901 --> 17:14.401
Yes.

17:23.779 --> 17:26.805
Don't you ever
speak to me again.

17:44.367 --> 17:47.393
<i>Abul Hassein Navour
is attempting to purchase files</i>

17:47.470 --> 17:50.030
<i>stolen from
the Russian government.</i>

17:50.106 --> 17:51.973
<i>Sloane is sending us to Moscow</i>

17:51.974 --> 17:54.841
<i>to prevent Navour
from getting the files.</i>

17:58.648 --> 18:01.549
<i>Dixon will impersonate Navour.</i>

18:01.651 --> 18:04.085
<i>My job is to break
into Navour's hotel room</i>

18:04.086 --> 18:06.586
<i>and take the money for the buy.</i>

18:07.023 --> 18:09.523
<i>So what's next?</i>

18:40.856 --> 18:42.123
Hello?

18:42.124 --> 18:44.624
Joey's Pizza?

18:44.860 --> 18:47.360
I'm sorry.
You've got the wrong number.

19:02.111 --> 19:03.378
It's me.

19:03.379 --> 19:05.939
- How you doing?
- How am I doing?

19:06.048 --> 19:07.315
Things have been better.

19:07.316 --> 19:08.316
I'm working with friends

19:08.317 --> 19:10.685
who have no idea who they're
really working for.

19:10.686 --> 19:12.320
I heard Sloane had you
meet your father.

19:12.321 --> 19:13.621
Yes, he did.

19:13.622 --> 19:16.122
So, what's my countermission?

19:16.792 --> 19:18.960
Navour's been on our short list
for the past six months.

19:18.961 --> 19:21.461
In August, he attempted to
purchase a nuke from Libya.

19:21.530 --> 19:22.997
You already knew about Moscow?

19:22.998 --> 19:25.200
No, we didn't.
Thank you for that.

19:25.201 --> 19:27.701
Don't mention it.

19:28.237 --> 19:30.737
That was cold.
So, what's my move?

19:30.773 --> 19:33.174
Carry out your assignment.
Get the documents.

19:33.175 --> 19:34.175
When you get back...

19:34.176 --> 19:36.244
make sure you are holding
the stolen files.

19:36.245 --> 19:38.873
We'll execute two brush passes
at the airport terminal.

19:38.981 --> 19:40.415
The first one
will take place at the gate.

19:40.416 --> 19:42.784
We'll intercept the materials
and create a duplicate copy,

19:42.785 --> 19:44.385
then return them to you
in a second pass

19:44.386 --> 19:46.054
to be executed
at the airport curb.

19:46.055 --> 19:47.756
- That's it?
- That's it.

19:47.757 --> 19:49.457
- Want a Slush-O?
- No, thank you.

19:49.458 --> 19:50.458
They're delicious.

19:50.459 --> 19:52.959
No, thanks.
I said I was cold.

19:53.295 --> 19:55.795
Good luck.

20:06.575 --> 20:09.669
No, I can imagine that
must have been devastating.

20:09.779 --> 20:12.748
Did he say anything to you
after he drove over your cat?

20:12.815 --> 20:16.512
Uh-huh.
Did he ever make any threats?

20:16.585 --> 20:17.786
To you or your cat.

20:17.787 --> 20:19.621
Sure. Okay.

20:19.622 --> 20:20.855
Well, you have my number
at the paper.

20:20.856 --> 20:22.023
All right. Bye-bye.

20:22.024 --> 20:23.992
- A man ran over his cat.
- I understand.

20:23.993 --> 20:25.760
We live in a world where people
drive over people's cats.

20:25.761 --> 20:27.595
You never answered
my question before.

20:27.596 --> 20:29.264
- Which one?
- What are you doing for dinner?

20:29.265 --> 20:31.132
Jenny, you're 19 years old.

20:31.133 --> 20:32.534
I'm 20.

20:32.535 --> 20:33.835
I'm not having
this conversation, okay?

20:33.836 --> 20:36.361
I'm ancient compared to you.
Look at me.

20:36.438 --> 20:38.938
Look how red my eyes are.

20:38.941 --> 20:40.175
You don't look too bad.

20:40.176 --> 20:41.576
Hey, do me a favor.

20:41.577 --> 20:44.045
Can you pull me that file
on Daniel Hecht?

20:44.046 --> 20:46.247
What, that murder?
Your friend?

20:46.248 --> 20:47.882
Yeah. Do you mind?

20:47.883 --> 20:50.383
No.

20:50.452 --> 20:51.586
Thanks.

20:51.587 --> 20:53.822
You don't take me
seriously, do you?

20:53.823 --> 20:56.191
No, I don't.

20:56.192 --> 20:58.692
Hmm.

21:13.042 --> 21:14.742
Dixon, do you copy?

21:14.743 --> 21:16.811
Wow, that's loud.

21:16.812 --> 21:18.146
You told Marshall you
wanted it louder.

21:18.147 --> 21:19.981
I was there.

21:19.982 --> 21:22.482
Okay. My headache and I
are 1017.

21:23.419 --> 21:24.786
Break a leg.

21:24.787 --> 21:27.287
You too.

21:47.476 --> 21:49.410
I'm on 15.

21:49.411 --> 21:50.812
Get the cash quickly.

21:50.813 --> 21:53.313
That is the plan.

22:23.379 --> 22:25.879
Chebekov and Kapochev
just showed up.

22:25.881 --> 22:27.615
Standing by for your call.

22:56.979 --> 22:59.971
Wow. Bodyguard's out.
Navour's in the shower.

23:00.082 --> 23:02.582
I'm going in for the money.

23:04.620 --> 23:07.120
Move fast.
They spotted me.

23:12.962 --> 23:14.929
Are you my Sudanese friend?

23:14.930 --> 23:17.065
Uh, Mr. Chebekov?

23:17.066 --> 23:19.566
Kapochev.
I am the handsome one.

23:20.803 --> 23:22.704
Uh, no protection with you?

23:22.705 --> 23:24.906
Why? Should I not
feel safe here?

23:24.907 --> 23:27.637
Here? Here, you should feel
very safe, yes.

23:27.743 --> 23:30.243
Come. Let's sit down.

23:44.326 --> 23:46.826
I know the guy
who owns this club.

23:46.895 --> 23:48.596
Kapochev...

23:48.597 --> 23:50.565
He thinks I brag too much.

23:50.566 --> 23:53.364
It's true. I do.
Yes. I brag too much.

24:05.547 --> 24:07.081
That's the problem with Sudan.

24:07.082 --> 24:09.017
There is no place for fun.

24:09.018 --> 24:11.578
It's a nice change
being out of the Sudan.

24:11.653 --> 24:14.153
I thought you said
you travel often.

24:15.724 --> 24:17.191
Yes.

24:17.192 --> 24:19.692
But not often enough.

24:24.566 --> 24:27.091
So, I can see you don't have
the money with you.

24:27.169 --> 24:30.434
- Is that correct?
- No, not at the moment.

24:30.506 --> 24:33.006
But the money is very close.

25:15.284 --> 25:17.485
I got bad news.

25:17.486 --> 25:20.250
Dixon, this wasn't a buy.
It was a holdup.

25:20.322 --> 25:22.847
They were gonna steal the files.
There's no money here.

25:22.925 --> 25:24.892
Fantastic.

25:24.893 --> 25:27.393
What?

25:29.031 --> 25:31.531
Vodka.

25:40.042 --> 25:42.542
Dixon, don't panic.

25:49.017 --> 25:51.517
I'll be there in two minutes.

26:01.897 --> 26:03.131
Any word from her yet?

26:03.132 --> 26:05.760
No. I don't expect to hear
anything till she gets back.

26:08.470 --> 26:11.200
- Your girlfriend is Alice.
- Will you shut up?

26:11.273 --> 26:12.773
- I'm just checking.
- Get out of my office.

26:12.774 --> 26:15.274
Okay. Bye.

26:18.280 --> 26:20.780
I'm in the bar.

26:21.683 --> 26:24.183
I can see you.

26:29.558 --> 26:32.618
Are those the files?
If they are, cough.

26:36.698 --> 26:39.198
Are they documents?

26:39.601 --> 26:42.101
Are they on disk?

26:43.539 --> 26:46.039
How many?

26:51.947 --> 26:54.447
Get ready to make a switch.

27:03.025 --> 27:05.525
Just like a drug deal.

27:07.596 --> 27:10.096
Would you like to taste
the Coke?

27:10.899 --> 27:13.424
How do I know
you haven't made copies?

27:13.502 --> 27:16.002
Those disks are encrypted.

27:29.751 --> 27:31.719
Okay, enough nonsense.

27:31.720 --> 27:33.020
Where's the money?

27:33.021 --> 27:35.649
You stay here.
I'll go get the cash.

27:35.724 --> 27:37.758
Sounds good.

27:37.759 --> 27:39.794
Who are you?

27:39.795 --> 27:41.395
At first,
I thought Navour sent you.

27:41.396 --> 27:43.896
Now I don't think that.

27:46.168 --> 27:48.668
Ugh!

28:23.739 --> 28:25.740
We got two
three-and-a-halfers.

28:25.741 --> 28:26.774
We gotta move fast.

28:26.775 --> 28:28.075
Let's use the third
and fourth copies.

28:28.076 --> 28:29.510
It should take
about 90 seconds.

28:29.511 --> 28:32.011
They're moving into customs.
We're talking seconds.

28:32.014 --> 28:34.514
I hope they're not corrupted.

28:41.123 --> 28:42.323
They're moving through
the main terminal!

28:42.324 --> 28:43.491
How long is this gonna take?

28:43.492 --> 28:45.992
These disks are very old.
We're moving as fast as we can.

28:50.899 --> 28:53.301
Let me see that data
as soon as it comes up.

28:53.302 --> 28:55.802
I'm not seeing it.

29:00.742 --> 29:01.909
Okay, here we go.

29:01.910 --> 29:04.410
Get me the other one!

29:19.861 --> 29:25.197
<i># Ooh, ooh #</i>

29:25.267 --> 29:28.725
<i># Pray God you can cope #</i>

29:28.804 --> 29:32.035
<i># I stand outside #</i>

29:32.140 --> 29:34.700
<i># This woman's work #</i>

29:34.810 --> 29:37.836
<i># This woman's world #</i>

29:37.946 --> 29:41.677
<i># Ooh, it's hard on the man #</i>

29:41.750 --> 29:45.379
<i># Now his part is over #</i>

29:45.454 --> 29:49.413
<i># Now starts the craft #</i>

29:49.491 --> 29:54.451
<i># Of the father #</i>

29:54.529 --> 29:58.966
<i># I know you have
a little life in you yet #</i>

29:59.034 --> 30:02.663
<i># I know you have
a lot of strength left #</i>

30:02.738 --> 30:06.697
<i># I know you have
a little life in you yet #</i>

30:06.808 --> 30:10.300
<i># I know you have
a lot of strength left #</i>

30:10.412 --> 30:14.143
<i># I should be crying,
but I just can't let it show #</i>

30:14.216 --> 30:18.118
<i># I should be hoping,
but I can't stop thinking #</i>

30:18.186 --> 30:21.747
<i># Of all the things I should've
said that I never said #</i>

30:21.823 --> 30:25.589
<i># All the things we should've
done that we never did #</i>

30:25.660 --> 30:28.959
<i># All the things I should've
given but I didn't #</i>

30:29.030 --> 30:35.401
<i># Oh, darling, make it go #</i>

30:35.470 --> 30:40.931
<i># Make it go away #</i>

30:43.345 --> 30:46.143
He says, "Honey,
I asked for butter an hour ago."

30:46.214 --> 30:47.615
I'm sitting there thinking,

30:47.616 --> 30:50.116
"Uh, no, you asked the other
black girl for butter,

30:50.152 --> 30:51.986
you rich, entitled
son of a bitch."

30:51.987 --> 30:53.954
Some people go out to eat,
this is just my theory,

30:53.955 --> 30:55.623
in order to abuse waiters.

30:55.624 --> 30:57.625
- No question.
- Creepy, isn't it?

30:57.626 --> 30:59.126
There are some bad people
in this world.

30:59.127 --> 31:00.594
- Hello.
- Hey.

31:00.595 --> 31:02.029
Sorry I'm late.

31:02.030 --> 31:05.431
This is for the offer
and for helping me move.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.201
Thank you.
Wow, look at this.

31:07.202 --> 31:09.336
Now we'll have something to
drink when you guys come over.

31:09.337 --> 31:11.639
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

31:11.640 --> 31:14.140
Sure.

31:14.843 --> 31:17.343
I'll be right back.

31:22.851 --> 31:23.984
What's going on?

31:23.985 --> 31:25.953
We've known each other
for three years.

31:25.954 --> 31:27.288
Just confirm that.

31:27.289 --> 31:28.689
Yes, three years.

31:28.690 --> 31:30.357
It feels like a lot longer
than that, right?

31:30.358 --> 31:32.526
We know each other
pretty well.

31:32.527 --> 31:33.794
Yeah, we do.

31:33.795 --> 31:36.197
You know I would never do
anything to hurt you.

31:36.198 --> 31:38.758
You know
that I'm a curious guy.

31:38.834 --> 31:40.134
Will, what did you do?

31:40.135 --> 31:41.669
You never gave me
any information on Danny.

31:41.670 --> 31:42.703
Oh, God, Will.

31:42.704 --> 31:44.205
So I looked around
a little bit.

31:44.206 --> 31:47.039
I found out
one piece of information

31:47.142 --> 31:49.343
which you might not know,
but maybe you do.

31:49.344 --> 31:51.045
What?

31:51.046 --> 31:53.546
The night
that Danny was killed...

31:54.683 --> 31:56.684
Did you know that he was
booked on a flight

31:56.685 --> 31:59.185
from L.A.X. To Singapore?

32:02.524 --> 32:04.525
Yeah. I knew that.

32:04.526 --> 32:06.927
You did? You knew that?

32:06.928 --> 32:09.263
Yeah, Danny had
a medical conference.

32:09.264 --> 32:12.324
He wanted me to fly out
and meet him afterwards.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.900
Have a week in Bali.

32:22.010 --> 32:25.036
I spend all day every day

32:25.146 --> 32:27.646
trying not to see him
the way I found him.

32:29.751 --> 32:33.619
I know you mean well.
I love you for that.

32:33.688 --> 32:38.648
But please,
please let this go.

32:38.727 --> 32:40.060
- Syd, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

32:40.061 --> 32:42.723
That's it. I get it.
I won't bring it up again.

32:42.797 --> 32:44.632
Okay.

32:44.633 --> 32:47.133
I just need a minute.

32:48.803 --> 32:50.104
Syd, I feel horrible.

32:50.105 --> 32:52.630
No, it's okay.
I swear to God, I'm okay.

32:52.707 --> 32:55.207
I'll be right there, okay?

33:01.049 --> 33:03.549
Okay.

33:09.224 --> 33:12.091
Doomsday 6. That was
the name of the operation.

33:12.160 --> 33:15.323
During the Cold War,
six fully armed nuclear weapons

33:15.397 --> 33:17.897
were smuggled into and buried
within the United States.

33:17.899 --> 33:19.133
In December '89,

33:19.134 --> 33:21.634
that information was disclosed
to the U.S. Government.

33:21.703 --> 33:24.763
The bombs were quickly
recovered and disarmed.

33:24.839 --> 33:26.407
That was the information
on those disks?

33:26.408 --> 33:27.408
No.

33:27.409 --> 33:30.037
They revealed a seventh nuke
buried still

33:30.145 --> 33:31.512
somewhere in the United States.

33:31.513 --> 33:33.213
- Where?
- We don't know yet.

33:33.214 --> 33:36.445
Those disks were encoded
with a sectional encryption.

33:36.518 --> 33:38.419
Analysis is working on it.

33:38.420 --> 33:40.920
This is all we've got so far.

33:42.924 --> 33:46.553
"Milovich Ivanov.
Buckingham, Virginia."

33:46.628 --> 33:47.628
Who's he?

33:47.629 --> 33:49.763
We assume he's the man
Navour was looking for.

33:49.764 --> 33:50.965
We have no file on him.

33:50.966 --> 33:52.433
You think he's babysitting
the nuke?

33:52.434 --> 33:53.767
Yes. I do.

33:53.768 --> 33:56.328
Go to that address.
Report back on Ivanov.

33:56.404 --> 33:58.572
Any aliases, where he lives,
where he works,

33:58.573 --> 34:01.269
the type of coffee he drinks,
the whole deal.

34:05.747 --> 34:08.246
Thanks.

34:11.853 --> 34:14.054
- Yeah?
- I'm going to see Ivanov.

34:14.054 --> 34:15.522
Who?

34:15.523 --> 34:17.625
Sydney? Sydney?!

34:17.626 --> 34:18.726
We have a name and an address.

34:18.726 --> 34:20.694
We are not gonna sit
on our hands here.

34:20.695 --> 34:22.896
I understand, but we
cannot move on that information.

34:22.897 --> 34:24.031
We can, and we will.

34:24.032 --> 34:26.166
We are risking Sydney Bristow's
placement in SD-6

34:26.167 --> 34:26.967
and perhaps her life.

34:26.967 --> 34:27.967
That may be the case.

34:27.969 --> 34:30.304
Yes, we might sacrifice
a double in the process.

34:30.304 --> 34:32.373
Sir, she's going to see him.
She's on her way.

34:32.373 --> 34:34.475
We are talking about
a nuclear weapon here.

34:34.476 --> 34:36.844
What do you expect me to do,
wait until Bristow contacts us?

34:36.844 --> 34:38.646
Read her file, sir.
Have you read her file?

34:38.647 --> 34:39.880
- Bristow...
- Do it.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.380
She is an asset.
She is doing our work.

34:42.449 --> 34:43.884
She was supposed to
contact you.

34:43.885 --> 34:45.152
There's a good reason
she couldn't.

34:45.152 --> 34:46.587
She is on her way to Virginia.

34:46.588 --> 34:48.322
If we send in a team,
we risk blowing her cover.

34:48.322 --> 34:49.590
We cannot afford to do that.

34:49.591 --> 34:50.591
Read her file.

34:50.592 --> 34:53.092
I've read it.

34:54.696 --> 34:55.862
What do you want?

34:55.864 --> 34:58.364
Five hours.
Give her five hours.

34:59.234 --> 35:00.601
Five hours.

35:00.602 --> 35:03.102
Thank you.

35:07.776 --> 35:09.009
Whew.

35:09.010 --> 35:10.010
Impressive.

35:10.011 --> 35:11.111
Yeah.

35:11.112 --> 35:12.646
Balls of steel.

35:12.647 --> 35:14.948
That's what I'm gonna
call you from now on.

35:14.949 --> 35:17.449
Hey, have you met
balls of steel?

37:31.753 --> 37:34.087
We've got a red wire, a yellow,
a blue, a blue-white.

37:34.088 --> 37:35.823
There's a white wire,
a yellow-red, an orange-red.

37:35.824 --> 37:38.292
A black, a white-black,
an orange, a purple.

37:38.293 --> 37:39.960
A purple-white, a green,
a green-white.

37:39.961 --> 37:42.396
Okay, okay.
Um, cut the blue-white wire.

37:42.397 --> 37:44.464
Cutting the blue-white wire.
Okay.

37:44.465 --> 37:45.766
Yeah. Oh, hold the phone!

37:45.767 --> 37:48.235
Don't tell me to hold the phone!
I'm sitting on a ticking bomb!

37:48.236 --> 37:49.970
Are there two timer panels
or one?

37:49.971 --> 37:52.272
Just, uh, I only see one.

37:52.273 --> 37:54.773
All right.
Uh, try the blue-white.

37:54.876 --> 37:56.143
Try it?

37:56.144 --> 37:57.578
No, cut it!

37:57.579 --> 37:59.446
Cut it.

37:59.447 --> 38:01.947
Okay.

38:16.464 --> 38:18.964
Hello?

38:22.337 --> 38:24.504
You called SD-6
instead of the CIA!

38:24.505 --> 38:26.506
That is unacceptable!
You should have called me!

38:26.507 --> 38:27.774
You?! What would you have done?!

38:27.775 --> 38:29.910
The CIA has access
to nuclear scientists.

38:29.911 --> 38:31.144
Give me a break.
I had two minutes.

38:31.145 --> 38:32.846
You went to Virginia
without contacting us.

38:32.847 --> 38:34.214
I did contact you!

38:34.215 --> 38:35.549
You are being irresponsible.

38:35.550 --> 38:37.150
SD-6 happens to have
a nuclear weapon.

38:37.151 --> 38:38.819
It happens to be my fault.

38:38.820 --> 38:41.088
After I called Marshall,
SD-6 knew I'd found the bomb.

38:41.089 --> 38:43.751
But you know what? We're gonna
track it and steal it back.

38:43.825 --> 38:45.559
It's in Cairo.

38:45.560 --> 38:46.560
What?

38:46.561 --> 38:48.495
When SD-6 picked up our nuke,

38:48.496 --> 38:50.430
they put it on a plane
bound for Egypt.

38:50.431 --> 38:52.199
Are you ready for this?

38:52.200 --> 38:54.700
They sold the thing
to Ineni Hassan.

39:05.847 --> 39:07.481
Hassan?

39:07.482 --> 39:09.982
Yeah.

39:11.085 --> 39:13.986
Reflected on both
our records, FYI.

39:20.361 --> 39:21.361
What?

39:21.362 --> 39:23.990
I told you I've been there.
Hassan's.

39:24.065 --> 39:26.166
- I can go back.
- No. Can't do it.

39:26.167 --> 39:27.401
- Why not?
- Hassan knows you.

39:27.402 --> 39:29.269
If you're spotted,
it will get back to Sloane.

39:29.270 --> 39:32.262
Then we'll just have to
make sure they never see me.

39:59.133 --> 40:01.633
Thanks for meeting me here.

40:03.604 --> 40:05.605
I'm sorry about hitting you.

40:05.606 --> 40:07.941
You're going to Cairo.
Devlin told me.

40:07.942 --> 40:10.502
Yeah. That's why
I had them call you.

40:10.611 --> 40:12.012
I need your help.

40:12.013 --> 40:14.675
SD-6 can't know
that's where I'm going.

40:14.749 --> 40:17.249
I'll take care of it.

40:19.988 --> 40:22.488
Dad...

40:23.691 --> 40:26.191
it was you, wasn't it?

40:27.328 --> 40:31.355
Who bought the ticket
to Singapore?

40:36.838 --> 40:39.338
You were in Taipei.

40:40.341 --> 40:42.342
I'd arranged a flight
for you as well.

40:42.343 --> 40:44.843
From Singapore,
you could have gone anywhere.

40:49.283 --> 40:51.084
I went to Danny's apartment,

40:51.085 --> 40:53.585
except that I got there
too late.

40:55.356 --> 40:57.856
Just minutes too late.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.800
Thank you.

41:19.013 --> 41:20.347
I have to go.

41:20.348 --> 41:22.848
Obviously.

41:43.538 --> 41:45.972
Tell Weiss I'm in operations,
and if Alice calls...

41:45.973 --> 41:47.307
I need you.

41:47.308 --> 41:49.242
Yeah. I know.

41:49.243 --> 41:51.743
Call me if there's anything.

41:53.081 --> 41:54.614
Let me just say this
about Bristow...

41:54.615 --> 41:56.450
Don't bother.
Don't apologize.

41:56.451 --> 41:58.452
You're not in trouble.
Virginia was my call.

41:58.453 --> 42:02.321
She is intimately familiar
with the Hassan base.

42:02.390 --> 42:04.524
She's gonna disable the weapon.
We are all over it.

42:04.525 --> 42:06.326
Well, you don't have to be.

42:06.327 --> 42:07.761
That's what I'm here
to tell you.

42:07.762 --> 42:09.463
You're being pulled off
the Bristow case.

42:09.464 --> 42:11.598
What? Why?

42:11.599 --> 42:13.467
Devlin wants
a more senior officer.

42:13.468 --> 42:14.734
You were right.

42:14.735 --> 42:16.603
This girl is important to us.

42:16.604 --> 42:18.805
Yeah, I know.

42:18.806 --> 42:20.774
He wants you to oversee
the office presentation

42:20.775 --> 42:22.742
at the D.C.I.
Nonproliferation meeting.

42:22.743 --> 42:26.304
Under the circumstances,
I think is pretty ironic.

42:30.852 --> 42:32.719
Yeah?

42:32.720 --> 42:35.220
Yeah, send him in.

42:43.197 --> 42:44.598
Have you heard from Sydney?

42:44.599 --> 42:45.999
Yeah. What's wrong with her?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.167
She went up North.

42:47.168 --> 42:48.969
I think she just needed
to get away.

42:48.970 --> 42:50.770
- Is she okay?
- She will be.

42:50.771 --> 42:52.806
I think it's hard for her,
that's all.

42:52.807 --> 42:55.742
Accepting the news
about what I do.

42:55.810 --> 42:57.177
Are you all right?

42:57.178 --> 42:59.678
Yeah, of course. Why?

43:00.281 --> 43:02.781
I don't know.
You seem a little...

43:04.952 --> 43:07.120
What?

43:07.121 --> 43:09.422
Nothing.

43:09.423 --> 43:11.923
Nothing.

43:12.360 --> 43:15.352
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah. Okay.

43:30.278 --> 43:32.778
I'm in.

44:06.180 --> 44:07.814
I think I found it.

44:07.815 --> 44:10.315
Copy.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.354
Yeah, I found it.

44:14.355 --> 44:16.855
Copy. Commence disabling.

44:34.642 --> 44:36.309
I've got it open.
I'm going for the core.

44:36.310 --> 44:38.478
Copy. Radio silence
until task complete.

44:38.479 --> 44:40.113
I know we just met
on the flight over,

44:40.114 --> 44:42.115
but do you have to talk like
such a robotron?

44:42.116 --> 44:43.483
Radio silence requested.

44:43.484 --> 44:45.984
I guess you do.

44:49.957 --> 44:51.691
All right, Robotron.

44:51.692 --> 44:54.192
I'm holding the core.
