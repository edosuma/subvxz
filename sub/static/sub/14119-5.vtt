-What!

-You planted marijuana
in my garden?

Well, uh,
medical marijuana, yes.

Where's Michael?

01:20.815 --> 01:22.381
Takin' a oatmeal bath, man.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.416
I'm having some
kind of allergic reaction.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.051
I'm itching all over.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.921
Michael, I don't think
you're supposed to cook
the oatmeal.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.289
Well, what are you
allergic to?

01:30.291 --> 01:32.157
Did you have
something weird for breakfast?

01:32.159 --> 01:34.793
No, I had the same breakfast
I had for the last 10 years.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.095
A couple blueberries,

01:36.097 --> 01:38.197
some Greek yogurt
and a roasted goat.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.299
Wait. I thought
you were a vegetarian!

01:40.301 --> 01:42.668
Greek yogurt
is vegetarian, Marquess.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.303
Guys, what about the mystery?

01:44.305 --> 01:46.705
Forget that mystery, Yung.
I got my own mystery to solve.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.006
Ugh.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.842
What are these bites
all over my body?

01:52.246 --> 01:54.580

We'll take you.

-PIGEON: Not me.
-Why?

01:55.950 --> 01:57.883
Ah, I like when I have
the house to myself.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.184
What do you when we're gone?

01:59.186 --> 02:00.853
You know what?
No, don't answer that.

02:00.855 --> 02:02.154
-I jack off!
-Oh, God...

02:02.156 --> 02:03.989

"Don't answer that."

02:05.159 --> 02:07.526
Oh, hey,
is oatmeal vegetarian?

02:12.398 --> 02:15.033
Hmm.
They look like mite bites.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.835
What are mite bites?

02:16.837 --> 02:18.704
You should ask
Evander Holyfield that.

with Mike bites.

02:20.608 --> 02:23.075

02:28.014 --> 02:29.882
No, not Mike bites.

02:29.884 --> 02:31.750
Mite bites.

02:31.752 --> 02:36.388
Mites, they are tiny insects
that live on other animals
like rats.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.789
Do you have any rats?

02:37.791 --> 02:39.725
What do you think?
You think I'm dirty?

02:39.727 --> 02:40.959
I live in a dirty house?

02:40.961 --> 02:42.261
You better watch it, Doc,

02:42.263 --> 02:44.229
or you're gonna get
some Mike bites.

02:44.231 --> 02:44.930
Dad.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.198
Do you have any pets?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.700
No. Oh, wait.
I have a pet bear.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.269
-What?
-We do?

02:50.271 --> 02:52.437
I haven't seen him in a while,
maybe he's hibernating.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.673
Any birds in the house?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.775
Mites are commonly
found on birds.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.810
Nope. No birds in my house.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.479
Dad, what about Pigeon?

03:00.481 --> 03:02.047
-Who's Pigeon.
-Oh, oh.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.283
He's a bird that lives
in the house with me.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.185
His bedroom is next
to my bedroom.

03:06.187 --> 03:09.054
We're always together.
We share the same brush.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.924
In my opinion, that's
what's causing your bites.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.458
So, what do I do?

03:13.460 --> 03:15.494
If I were you, I'd remove
the pigeon from your home.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.463
Oh, man. Poor Pigeon.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.199
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

03:20.201 --> 03:22.434
Do you think I'd be
a candidate for fillers?

03:22.436 --> 03:25.137
I just feel like I look
tired all the time.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.210
Hmm. You know what?
I'll schedule an appointment.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.847
Oh, man. How am I gonna tell
Pigeon he's gotta move out?

03:35.849 --> 03:38.450
All right, all right.
Maybe I could
just tell him a lie?

03:38.452 --> 03:41.220
I could tell him
my sick Grandma
must come to live with me,

03:41.222 --> 03:43.288
and she's scared
of pigeons because, um...

03:43.290 --> 03:46.692
Because of that time
when she was attacked
by a pigeon in World War II.

03:46.694 --> 03:47.826
-That's good.
-Hmm.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.294
Yeah, that's what I'll say.

03:49.296 --> 03:50.896
Michael, we've talked
about this kind of thing.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.364
When you lie
you're saying that

03:52.366 --> 03:54.600
your feelings don't matter,
but they do matter.

03:54.602 --> 03:58.237
And you have to trust that
even if Pigeon is disappointed
in the moment,

03:58.239 --> 04:01.340
the truth won't
threaten your friendship.

you can't live here anymore.

What?

04:25.733 --> 04:27.299
What? Is this a joke?

04:27.301 --> 04:30.002
Is this because of the pot?
It's basically legal now.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.437
No, it's not the pot.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.607
Is it about the video
camera I hooked up
in Yung Hee's bathroom?

04:35.609 --> 04:36.675
What?

04:36.677 --> 04:38.210
No, it's not that.

04:38.212 --> 04:40.345
Is it because I put a roofie
in her soda last night?

04:40.347 --> 04:42.581
-What?
-Calm down,
you didn't even drink it.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.149

good roofie.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.118
-Ugh.
-No.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.153
Is it because I tried to take
all those up-skirt pictures
of Yung Hee?

04:48.155 --> 04:49.688
-When?
-Right now.

wearing a skirt, you idiot.

04:57.298 --> 05:00.332
Just be honest.
He'll understand.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.801
The reason you can't live here
anymore is because

05:02.803 --> 05:04.269
you're a disgusting,
filthy creature

05:04.271 --> 05:05.771
with mites all over you

we solved the mystery.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.354
(GASPS)

10:22.356 --> 10:24.022
Oh, no. We forgot
about this mystery.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.024
I hope it wasn't
time sensitive.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.392
"Dear Mike Tyson,

10:27.394 --> 10:30.295
"this is extremely
time sensitive.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.164
"I have discovered
an armed nuclear device

10:33.166 --> 10:34.666
"hidden inside
the Hoover Dam."

10:34.668 --> 10:35.734
(GASPS)

10:35.736 --> 10:38.003
(EXPLOSION)

10:38.005 --> 10:39.270
Goodbye, mosquitoes,

10:39.272 --> 10:40.772
I'm really sorry
it didn't work out.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.908
Good luck out there,
in that cold, cruel world.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.978
-(SCREAMING)
-Dr. Friedman,
what the hell, man?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.446
I hope you die!

10:49.715 --> 10:50.982
(FROG CROAKING)

11:09.035 --> 11:11.670
I really miss my cats.
I had a cat named Kenya.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.872
I had her for a long time,
probably 12 years

11:13.874 --> 11:16.875
and then eventually, um,
she bit someone's hands off.
