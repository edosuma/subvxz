<i>This changes everything.</i>

00:40.922 --> 00:44.215
_

00:48.140 --> 00:51.560
I could stay up here all day.

00:52.144 --> 00:55.773
But, we have work to do, don't we, girl?

01:05.867 --> 01:07.284
Hey! Guys!

01:07.368 --> 01:09.954
You are officially relieved
from guard duty!

01:11.038 --> 01:12.748
Guys!

01:12.832 --> 01:15.125
Stormfly, get me in close, would ya?

01:16.878 --> 01:20.047
Why do we have to go through this
every single...

01:21.799 --> 01:23.050
Are you kidding me?

01:30.599 --> 01:32.142
They didn't stand their watch, Hiccup.

01:32.226 --> 01:35.563
Those dummies left two dummies
in their place.

01:35.646 --> 01:40.275
You know, those dummies could conceivably
be just as effective as the twins.

01:40.359 --> 01:42.945
Not funny.
We built that watchtower so that...

01:43.029 --> 01:44.906
I know why we built it, Astrid.

01:44.989 --> 01:48.576
I just don't understand how
this isn't making you completely insane.

01:48.659 --> 01:51.537
Because, then there'd be
two crazy people in this conversation

01:51.620 --> 01:53.789
and we probably wouldn't resolve anything.

01:53.873 --> 01:56.834
- Are you saying I'm...
- Astrid, let me talk to the twins.

01:56.918 --> 02:00.212
I'll get their side of the story,
then we can figure out what we need to do.

02:00.295 --> 02:02.423
I guess it's a start.

02:02.506 --> 02:06.010
Well, if it isn't
our crack security team now.

02:06.093 --> 02:09.764
Oh! Please, please, there's no need
to shower us with accolades.

02:09.847 --> 02:13.475
Tuff, you left two dummies
to protect this entire base.

02:13.559 --> 02:16.020
What were you thinking?

02:16.103 --> 02:18.564
- Terror mail. Hm.
- "Dummies," you say?

02:18.647 --> 02:21.692
She does. Poor confused thing.

02:21.776 --> 02:25.362
What you failed to realize
in your foggy morning state,

02:25.446 --> 02:29.450
is that those are not dummies.
They are scareships.

02:29.533 --> 02:31.243
Scareships? You're serious?

02:31.326 --> 02:33.328
You didn't see any ships
near the island, did you?

02:33.412 --> 02:35.039
I think not. And why?

02:35.122 --> 02:37.499
They were appropriately scared away.

02:37.583 --> 02:41.336
By the appropriately named "scareships."

02:41.420 --> 02:44.632
- Are you following any of this?
- Not super closely.

02:44.715 --> 02:46.467
I'm actually reading this.

02:46.550 --> 02:48.552
It's from Johann. He's in trouble.

02:51.806 --> 02:54.767
You are not leaving me
with these two muttonheads.

02:54.850 --> 02:57.352
She knows we're standing
right here, right?

02:57.436 --> 02:59.647
Look, Johann is surrounded
by Dragon Hunters,

02:59.730 --> 03:01.189
and his ship is taking on water.

03:01.273 --> 03:02.858
We have to get out there and help him.

03:02.942 --> 03:05.027
Then, let me saddle up Stormfly,
I'll be there in...

03:05.111 --> 03:07.613
Astrid, you need stay here
and hold down the Edge.

03:07.696 --> 03:10.074
And make sure nothing happens
to the Dragon Eye.

03:10.156 --> 03:12.118
I can't believe what's happening.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.996
This actually may be
the worst day in history.

03:15.079 --> 03:18.499
Astrid, Snotlout and I have
the only working dragon armor,

03:18.582 --> 03:21.085
and Meatlug is immune
to the Dragon Hunters' arrows.

03:21.167 --> 03:24.130
You hear that, girl?
Who's a special dragon?

03:24.212 --> 03:26.381
Meatlug is, that's who.

03:26.465 --> 03:28.968
It just makes sense for us
to be the ones to go.

03:29.051 --> 03:31.846
Hiccup, please! For all that
is sacred in Thor's world,

03:31.929 --> 03:33.764
you cannot leave me alone with these two...

03:33.848 --> 03:35.599
What do you say?
Simpletons? Blockheads?

03:35.683 --> 03:38.060
I was always partial to dimwit myself.

03:38.144 --> 03:40.813
It rolls trippingly off the tongue.

03:40.896 --> 03:42.397
Oh, yeah. Watch this.

03:42.481 --> 03:44.817
"What wit dim, would the twins dim wit,

03:44.900 --> 03:47.820
if dim wits could wit dim?"

03:47.903 --> 03:49.113
Say that five times fast.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.448
You see what I'm talking about, right?

03:51.532 --> 03:53.408
Hey, it's not like we woke up this morning

03:53.492 --> 03:56.411
hoping to spend 24/7
with you either, Astrid.

03:56.495 --> 03:58.873
I mean, you are not exactly a picnic.

03:58.956 --> 04:02.042
And I think you know what
I'm saying. You have not ever

04:02.043 --> 04:05.129
been a blanket on a grassy
knoll with delicious food.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.631
But, we are team players.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.300
We will do what is necessary
for the good of the group.

04:10.425 --> 04:12.178
Hence, we shall remain behind

04:12.260 --> 04:14.847
and enjoy your good company,
my fair Astrid.

04:14.930 --> 04:18.934
Even if you have no blankets
or grassy knolls to offer.

04:19.017 --> 04:21.478
We'll be back by tomorrow at the latest.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.564
Just do the best you can. Okay?

04:23.647 --> 04:25.566
And try to get along, please?

04:25.649 --> 04:28.110
No need to worry about us, young Hiccup.

04:28.194 --> 04:31.405
Oh, Astrid, I know these next 24 hours
will be difficult for you.

04:31.488 --> 04:34.783
Unable to look into these deep romantic,

04:34.867 --> 04:37.578
yet hauntingly beautiful eyes,

04:37.661 --> 04:40.206
shimmering like gold dust in the wind...

04:41.999 --> 04:45.169
Okay, so we'll see you
when we get back. Have fun.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.971
Don't talk to any
strange Dragon Hunters!

04:48.630 --> 04:52.134
Bye. We'll miss you.
Write home often.

04:52.218 --> 04:55.012
Okay, I think the first
team building exercise

04:55.013 --> 04:57.806
we should perform is that
of going back to sleep.

04:57.890 --> 04:59.600
I mean, as a team, of course.

04:59.683 --> 05:02.895
Couldn't agree more.
What say you, Astrid?

05:02.978 --> 05:05.585
I have to go hide this.
And when I get back,

05:05.620 --> 05:09.443
I expect both of you to be
sweating profusely from hard work.

05:10.485 --> 05:12.487
"What say you, Astrid?"
Really?

05:12.571 --> 05:15.407
Haven't I always told you
it's better to beg for permission

05:15.490 --> 05:17.201
than to ask for forgiveness?

05:17.284 --> 05:19.620
Personally, I think
it's the other way around.

05:19.703 --> 05:21.455
Oh, so now you're the literary authority

05:21.538 --> 05:24.166
on the subject of permissions
and forgivenesses?

05:24.250 --> 05:26.794
Quit talking. You lose focus
when your mouth is moving.

05:26.877 --> 05:28.545
"I'm Astrid."

05:28.629 --> 05:30.189
<i>Real mature, guys.</i>

05:30.224 --> 05:33.508
We've done all of these already?
Man, we are kicking some serious...

05:33.592 --> 05:36.011
No, no, no. That's your first one.

05:36.095 --> 05:39.598
All the others, I did by myself.
Go, team.

05:50.151 --> 05:53.737
You know what?
I'll get the rest of the lumber myself.

05:53.821 --> 05:57.241
You two start lashing together
some poles for the first level of stairs.

05:57.323 --> 06:00.244
- Do you think you can handle that?
- She didn't let us answer.

06:00.326 --> 06:03.080
That's what they call
a "rhetorical question."

06:03.164 --> 06:04.769
Please. Like that's even a thing.

06:04.770 --> 06:06.374
And you don't know what it means.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.043
A rhetorical question is one asked

06:08.127 --> 06:10.545
solely to produce an effect
or to make an assertion.

06:10.629 --> 06:14.122
Not to elicit a reply. Bam!

06:24.185 --> 06:27.729
- Not too teamly, if you ask me.
- Not in the slightest.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.068
Really. Where in Thor's name
could you two have...

06:33.152 --> 06:36.864
<i>- Whoo! Yeah!
- Ha-ha! Look out!</i>

06:36.947 --> 06:39.867
<i>- Whoa-oh-ah!
- Whoo!</i>

06:42.452 --> 06:43.411
That hurt.

06:49.043 --> 06:51.045
Astrid, you have got to try this.

06:51.128 --> 06:52.754
The landing's a little rough, but...

06:52.838 --> 06:55.216
Astrid, we know this wasn't
what you were planning,

06:55.341 --> 06:57.383
but we really think
we're on to something here.

06:57.467 --> 06:59.845
The stairs have their own use for sure,

06:59.928 --> 07:02.931
- but this can truly come in handy.
- It can, huh?

07:03.015 --> 07:04.808
Yes. In the right situations...

07:04.892 --> 07:08.229
And what situations would
those be exactly, Ruffnut?

07:08.312 --> 07:10.397
Well, I mean, we could...

07:10.731 --> 07:14.026
- If we were in a...
- You have no clue, do you?

07:14.109 --> 07:15.236
Didn't think so.

07:15.319 --> 07:18.030
- Is that a retalkrical question?
- And do you know why?

07:18.113 --> 07:21.992
Because, the two of you don't think.
You don't plan.

07:22.076 --> 07:26.080
You just come up with these crazy ideas
and you forge ahead,

07:26.163 --> 07:30.000
with no regard for logic or what
you're even supposed to be doing.

07:30.084 --> 07:33.461
What am I gonna do with you guys?
Seriously. Tell me!

07:33.545 --> 07:35.589
Well, you can start by being kind.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.362
Oh, wait, you can't do
that because kindness

07:38.363 --> 07:41.053
is nowhere in that scrawny
little body of yours.

07:41.136 --> 07:42.554
- What?
- Easy, sis.

07:42.637 --> 07:44.932
Back up, bro! I got this.

07:45.515 --> 07:48.727
- Do you know what your problem is, Ruffnut?
- Oh, you bet I do.

07:48.810 --> 07:52.522
I've got a list of problems so long,
I can't even keep track.

07:52.606 --> 07:56.068
Question is, do you know
what your problem is, Astrid?

07:56.151 --> 07:58.404
My problem?
Are you serious?

07:58.486 --> 08:01.740
Allow me to lay it out for you,
my flaxen-haired friend.

08:01.823 --> 08:03.909
You have no respect
for the people around you

08:03.992 --> 08:06.453
who are just trying to help
and be a part of the team.

08:06.536 --> 08:08.247
You have no respect for Fishlegs,

08:08.330 --> 08:09.915
certainly none for Snotlout,

08:09.998 --> 08:12.500
and you couldn't have less respect
for the two of us!

08:12.584 --> 08:14.702
<i>Now, you can go ahead
and shame the others.</i>

08:14.711 --> 08:17.881
You can mock this entire
island of dragons if you wish.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.717
But I am not gonna stand here
and listen to you

08:20.801 --> 08:24.319
insult the entire "nut" family tree!

08:26.223 --> 08:29.851
She's wrong, you know.
I... do. I...

08:30.060 --> 08:33.272
respect you guys.

08:33.355 --> 08:36.287
Oh, please.
You can barely even say it.

08:36.400 --> 08:40.279
So sad, Astrid.
So, so sad.

08:41.155 --> 08:44.783
Hiccup, where are you
when I need you?

08:46.201 --> 08:48.287
Okay, from what the Terror mail said,

08:48.370 --> 08:50.580
Johann sent it from this general area.

08:50.705 --> 08:53.000
And it said his ship was incapacitated.

08:53.125 --> 08:56.044
Correct. So, he should be
right below us somewhere.

08:57.921 --> 09:00.257
Good thing Meatlug is immune
to those arrows, huh?

09:00.341 --> 09:02.676
Too bad you aren't.
Snotlout!

09:02.759 --> 09:04.344
Don't listen to him, girl.

09:04.345 --> 09:06.888
<i>I'll be fine. We'll be fine.
Right?</i>

09:07.806 --> 09:10.309
Uh, I'm not so sure about that.

09:13.061 --> 09:15.481
Get away! 
You, don't come near!

09:16.064 --> 09:18.692
Hey, I thought
he said it was Dragon Hunters.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.903
- Not actual dragons.
- He did, but you know Johann.

09:21.987 --> 09:24.865
"Dragons, Dragon Hunters,
what's the difference?"

09:24.948 --> 09:27.034
No, no!

09:29.244 --> 09:31.372
I wonder what Johann did
to get them so mad.

09:31.455 --> 09:33.581
Probably told them
one of his dumb stories.

09:33.665 --> 09:35.042
<i>Not funny, Snotlout.</i>

09:35.125 --> 09:36.793
I wasn't even trying to be funny.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.921
All right, let's just get Johann
out of there, and be careful.

09:40.005 --> 09:41.756
We don't want to hurt
any of these dragons.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.801
What about them hurting us?
That never seems to enter your mind.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.887
<i>Master Hiccup!
They're everywhere!</i>

09:46.970 --> 09:48.430
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

09:48.555 --> 09:50.932
Okay, all right, never mind,
never mind, never mind!

09:55.020 --> 09:58.732
Wow, bud! We really must have
caught these guys on a bad day.

09:58.815 --> 10:01.902
Ah! Hoo! Back! Back, I say!

10:04.571 --> 10:06.622
This reminds me of
the time I was attacked

10:06.710 --> 10:09.868
by a flock of rabid wild fruit
bats off the coast of Palau.

10:09.951 --> 10:10.911
<i>Be quiet!</i>

10:10.994 --> 10:13.330
You're only making them
more angry. And us, too.

10:13.414 --> 10:15.499
<i>Master Snoutlout!
Thank Thor!</i>

10:15.582 --> 10:17.209
Hey! What'd I do?

10:17.292 --> 10:19.669
It's Captain Fruit Bat you want, not me.

10:21.129 --> 10:24.091
No, no! Oh, come on!
They're very mean!

10:24.174 --> 10:25.551
Johann, look out!

10:37.563 --> 10:39.481
Hey! Fishlegs!
Where are you going?

10:39.482 --> 10:42.401
You know, we're not done here.

10:42.984 --> 10:44.285
<i>"Astrid, Astrid, Astrid!"</i>

10:44.286 --> 10:46.238
Everyone's always talking about Astrid.

10:46.321 --> 10:47.948
How pretty she is.
How smart she is.

10:48.031 --> 10:50.784
How muscular and shapely
her upper arms are.

10:52.911 --> 10:56.498
How can Astrid not see the genius
in Stuffnut and Fluffnut?

11:02.337 --> 11:05.090
Chicken! What is it?
What's wrong?

11:07.259 --> 11:11.096
Shh, shh... Relax, Chicken.
Easy, little chicken.

11:11.179 --> 11:14.766
Now, gather your strength.
Is it Ruffnut?

11:14.891 --> 11:17.643
Oh, it is. Is she in trouble?

11:17.727 --> 11:19.374
Oh, you have such a way with words.

11:19.375 --> 11:22.608
I will find her and bring her back.
You, you rest, Chicken.

11:24.234 --> 11:26.987
Don't ruffle your feathers.
I shall return.

11:30.115 --> 11:32.700
<i>- Help!
- Ruff! No!</i>

11:33.619 --> 11:37.456
The Dragon Hunters.
Astrid. I gotta get Astrid.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.295
<i>When I get out of these chains,
I'm gonna...</i>

11:43.378 --> 11:45.005
You're gonna what?

11:45.088 --> 11:47.007
<i>Uh, I haven't decided yet,</i>

11:47.090 --> 11:49.635
<i>but rest assured,
you are not gonna like it!</i>

11:49.717 --> 11:52.346
Feisty, isn't she?
I like it.

11:54.389 --> 11:57.058
And they just picked Fishlegs up
and flew off?

11:57.142 --> 11:58.310
Yeah, definitely, that's how it happened.

11:58.393 --> 12:01.522
Johann, did the wild dragons
take anything from the ship?

12:01.605 --> 12:04.608
- Food, fresh water, anything?
- No, Master Hiccup.

12:04.690 --> 12:06.943
They seemed only interested
in terrorizing me

12:07.027 --> 12:10.405
until you lot came along,
then they started terrorizing you.

12:10.489 --> 12:12.698
Which was a bit of a relief,
if I'm being honest.

12:12.782 --> 12:15.118
I've always been a great friend
to the dragons.

12:15.202 --> 12:19.331
That they would turn on me like this,
it's inconceivable.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.249
This doesn't make any sense.

12:21.333 --> 12:24.252
Nightmares, Nadders, Gronckles,
even in the wild,

12:24.336 --> 12:26.630
these dragons
shouldn't be this aggressive.

12:26.712 --> 12:29.341
I mean, from a Speed Stinger
or a Changewing,

12:29.424 --> 12:31.343
those dragons I could understand,

12:31.426 --> 12:33.970
but maybe these guys have just
never seen humans before.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.640
All I know is that we've been around
these guys in the wild.

12:36.722 --> 12:39.084
None of them have ever acted like this.

12:40.686 --> 12:43.938
<i>Snotlout, I hate to admit it,
but you've got a point.</i>

12:45.899 --> 12:48.652
Tuff, you okay?

12:50.237 --> 12:52.656
Tuffnut, breathe.
What's going on?

12:53.365 --> 12:56.159
You have got to do something
about those stairs.

12:56.243 --> 12:59.954
I mean, there must be hundreds of
them, there's over ten at least.

13:00.038 --> 13:01.164
That's it? The stairs?

13:01.248 --> 13:03.667
Oh, no. It's Ruffnut.
They got Ruffnut!

13:03.749 --> 13:05.960
- Who did?
- The Dragon Hunters.

13:08.880 --> 13:12.050
- This is all my fault.
- Oh, tell me about it.

13:12.133 --> 13:13.843
I shouldn't have been so hard on her.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.638
You were way too hard on her,
on poor, poor sis.

13:16.722 --> 13:19.683
She's just Ruff being Ruff.
She can't help it.

13:19.765 --> 13:21.935
Truer words, A.
Truer words.

13:23.811 --> 13:26.398
Sorry. Just trying to help you
work through,

13:26.481 --> 13:29.401
you know, the shame,
all the bad things that you did,

13:29.484 --> 13:31.445
all the things you should feel bad about,

13:31.528 --> 13:33.154
you know, get some closure.

13:39.911 --> 13:41.121
What is it?

13:41.246 --> 13:43.749
There may not be a Ruffnut
to apologize to.

13:43.831 --> 13:47.168
In fact, there may not be
any of us at all.

13:50.422 --> 13:53.049
Okay, what's the plan?
We have to get my sister back.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.842
First thing is to send an SOS to Berk.

13:54.926 --> 13:57.971
We need reinforcements, fast.
The auxiliary team.

13:59.013 --> 14:01.349
How do we know he'll get there in time?

14:01.433 --> 14:02.267
We don't.

14:02.350 --> 14:04.645
Well, how do we know
they'll get back here in time?

14:04.728 --> 14:05.562
We don't.

14:05.646 --> 14:08.607
Okay, there is a terrifying lack
of clarity in those answers.

14:08.690 --> 14:10.233
It's all gonna be okay, Tuffnut.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.444
We're gonna hold down the Edge,
defend this base,

14:12.527 --> 14:15.196
and we will get your sister back. Okay?

14:15.280 --> 14:18.366
- Say, "Okay, Astrid."
- Okay, Astrid.

14:18.450 --> 14:21.119
Now, there is no possible way
we can defend the Edge

14:21.202 --> 14:23.830
against an all-out assault
with only one flyable dragon.

14:23.913 --> 14:26.792
But maybe, we can slow them
down until help gets here

14:26.874 --> 14:28.835
if we use our spears and arrows sparingly.

14:28.918 --> 14:32.339
Wait! I know an even better way
we can slow them down.

14:32.422 --> 14:33.965
Not now, Tuff. I need to think.

14:34.048 --> 14:36.343
No, seriously, Astrid!
You need to hear this.

14:36.426 --> 14:37.260
Listen to me!

14:37.344 --> 14:39.137
All right, what? What is your idea?

14:39.220 --> 14:42.766
Okay, well, as you know,
tricking is my area of expertise.

14:42.849 --> 14:46.060
I am the official Dragon's Edge Trickster.

14:46.144 --> 14:48.814
Trickster extraordinaire.
The Mayor of Tricksville.

14:48.896 --> 14:50.398
Yeah. I get it.
We all know how tricky you are.

14:50.482 --> 14:54.528
But, they don't!
So, I figure, we trick them

14:54.611 --> 14:57.531
into thinking there are
more of us than there are.

14:57.614 --> 14:59.032
We can start with our scareships,

14:59.115 --> 15:02.369
and then build our own
little tricking army. It'll be awesome!

15:02.452 --> 15:04.496
Wait. I think I just had
another idea. Whoa!

15:04.579 --> 15:06.414
Do you know how many Loki-ish thoughts

15:06.415 --> 15:08.249
are running through my mind right now?

15:08.333 --> 15:10.251
- Tuff...
- It's like a hurricane of practical jokes

15:10.335 --> 15:13.505
pounding on the inside of my head!
Whoa, here comes one...

15:13.588 --> 15:14.506
- Tuffnut!
- Yes?

15:14.589 --> 15:16.924
This is not the time for pranks,
or Loki-ing.

15:17.008 --> 15:20.303
This is a time for strategic thinking
and precise preparation.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.723
There are times in life
when you have to be serious.

15:22.806 --> 15:24.850
Deadly serious, or people can die.

15:24.932 --> 15:27.018
We can die. Ruffnut can die.

15:27.101 --> 15:29.145
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.858
I am taking it seriously.
I'm seriously a trickster.

15:32.940 --> 15:35.235
And I seriously have some ideas
that can help.

15:35.318 --> 15:36.528
Tuff, listen to me.

15:36.611 --> 15:38.572
You know all those times
early in the morning

15:38.655 --> 15:42.283
when it's still dark outside,
and I'm out by myself on Stormfly?

15:42.367 --> 15:45.453
Uh, well, I do now.
Wait, is this gonna get weird?

15:45.537 --> 15:47.497
No. What I am doing is training.

15:47.581 --> 15:51.084
Day and night, I train myself
for situations just like this.

15:51.167 --> 15:54.755
- That's why we're gonna do it my way.
- But, I have ideas. Good ideas.

15:54.838 --> 15:57.006
- And, I believe you.
- No, you don't.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.342
The only thing you believe
is that I'll mess this up

15:59.426 --> 16:02.721
- and get us all killed.
- No. That's not true.

16:02.804 --> 16:05.098
The only thing I believe
right now is that we're

16:05.099 --> 16:07.392
wasting time arguing, when
we should be preparing.

16:07.475 --> 16:10.896
- Come on, there's a lot of work to do.
- That's my sister out there, Astrid.

16:10.978 --> 16:13.398
And if this goes wrong
and we don't save her,

16:13.481 --> 16:15.449
I couldn't live with myself.

16:16.067 --> 16:17.736
You know what?
You're right.

16:17.819 --> 16:21.072
You do what you have to do,
and I'm gonna set up our defenses.

16:21.155 --> 16:23.575
Then we'll come together,
and when the time is right,

16:23.700 --> 16:26.077
decide which one to use, okay?

16:26.160 --> 16:27.954
Awesome plan.
I like it!

16:28.037 --> 16:30.415
And we'll definitely end up
using mine. So, it's great.

16:30.498 --> 16:33.084
Good, just so long as
we understand and agree

16:33.167 --> 16:36.716
that I lead the counter-attack
and you follow me.

16:37.547 --> 16:38.506
<i>Hmm.</i>

16:43.511 --> 16:45.815
Oh, boy.

16:52.729 --> 16:54.272
Yeah.

17:04.073 --> 17:06.492
It's him, right?

17:16.127 --> 17:18.713
Well, guess you don't know
the Dragon Riders

17:18.797 --> 17:21.132
as well as you thought, eh, Dagur?

17:21.214 --> 17:22.258
<i>You don't know 'em at all.</i>

17:22.342 --> 17:25.051
Hey, at least my brother had a plan
to get the Dragon Eye.

17:25.136 --> 17:27.137
It's not his fault
they didn't take the bait.

17:27.221 --> 17:30.684
They never left to rescue
Trader Johann from those dragons.

17:30.767 --> 17:32.185
The girl proves it.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.729
<i>Yeah. I prove
that you have all been fooled.</i>

17:34.813 --> 17:36.898
Then I guess we better leave.
Come up with a new plan.

17:36.982 --> 17:38.232
No new plans.

17:38.316 --> 17:40.819
We'll just have to deal
with all of them instead.

17:40.902 --> 17:43.571
<i>Listen, if you all
want to go on a suicide mission,</i>

17:43.655 --> 17:45.239
<i>that's your problem, buddy.</i>

17:45.323 --> 17:46.974
<i>But don't say I didn't warn you!</i>

17:46.975 --> 17:49.452
She's lying!
She's trying to confuse us.

17:49.536 --> 17:52.288
<i>I'm always lying!</i>

17:52.372 --> 17:54.332
<i>Wait, now I'm confused.</i>

17:54.415 --> 17:57.002
Or she's telling the truth to confuse us.

17:57.585 --> 18:00.213
Gather the men. We move slowly.

18:00.296 --> 18:04.091
Destroy anything in our path,
until we get our Dragon Eye.

18:04.175 --> 18:07.387
Then, we destroy whatever's left.

18:11.016 --> 18:12.726
Uh, excuse me, sir.

18:12.851 --> 18:14.352
Oh, and ma'am.

18:14.435 --> 18:17.814
But there's something
I've been wondering about.

18:17.898 --> 18:19.566
A daily occurrence, but go ahead.

18:19.649 --> 18:21.902
In regards to this Ryker fellow,

18:21.985 --> 18:25.989
it seems as though
he's taken on the role of leader.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.950
And, well, I was always
under the assumption

18:29.034 --> 18:30.869
that this was your role.

18:30.952 --> 18:33.120
<i>Pfftt! That's not his role.</i>

18:33.204 --> 18:37.417
- It is, you dunderhead.
- We're just using Ryker for the time being.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.210
When he leads us to the Dragon Eye...

18:39.293 --> 18:41.462
We figure out
the most painful and horrible way

18:41.546 --> 18:43.798
to get rid of him
and the rest of his crew. Duh!

18:43.882 --> 18:47.010
- Ah! That's a relief.
- Once we get the Dragon Eye,

18:47.093 --> 18:49.804
Ryker and his men?
See ya!

18:49.888 --> 18:52.933
<i>That really is the single
worst plan I have ever heard...</i>

18:53.016 --> 18:55.101
Would you stop talking!

18:59.773 --> 19:02.400
- Stop. Don't move.
- Oh, finally.

19:02.483 --> 19:05.028
Do you know how long we've been
walking? My feet are swollen

19:05.111 --> 19:07.030
- to the size of watermelons.
- Shh!

19:11.785 --> 19:12.869
Master Hiccup,

19:12.953 --> 19:16.497
I realize that you are
the dragon expert among us...

19:16.581 --> 19:18.583
I wouldn't say
the dragon expert, I'd say...

19:18.708 --> 19:20.919
- Shh!
- As I was saying,

19:21.002 --> 19:24.213
it appears to me
that this island is occupied

19:24.297 --> 19:28.676
by a rather unfriendly pack
of wild dragons.

19:29.260 --> 19:32.013
You're right, Johann.
But it's worse than that.

19:32.138 --> 19:35.016
Oh, ho-ho, you're full
of good news, aren't you?

19:35.100 --> 19:36.851
Gimme that.

19:42.148 --> 19:45.568
So, this means we get to
go rescue him, I suppose.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.362
It does.
And thank you for volunteering.

19:48.446 --> 19:49.614
But it's not gonna be easy.

19:49.697 --> 19:53.284
- With you as captain, I know it won't.
- Right, you see up there?

19:53.367 --> 19:56.245
<i>Dragon sentries. They look
like they're ready for anything.</i>

19:56.329 --> 20:00.000
<i>It's gonna be really hard
to get anywhere near Fishlegs.</i>

20:00.083 --> 20:03.878
Well, I suppose the life of a
Dragon Rider is shorter than most.

20:03.962 --> 20:05.546
I'll miss him dearly.

20:05.630 --> 20:07.966
Good point, Johann.
Let's get out of here.

20:08.049 --> 20:10.010
No, no, we're not going anywhere.

20:10.093 --> 20:12.804
I said it's gonna be hard,
not impossible.

20:14.806 --> 20:17.308
This is our last line
of defense, Stormfly.

20:17.391 --> 20:22.033
If they make it this far,
hopefully, these will take them out.

20:22.396 --> 20:23.314
Mmm.

20:27.902 --> 20:30.071
Uh-oh.

20:33.116 --> 20:36.119
Uh, regardless of how
this looks right now,

20:36.202 --> 20:39.789
I can assure you I have a
master plan for these balloons.

20:39.873 --> 20:41.457
I'm sure you do.

20:42.667 --> 20:45.879
Um, but Astrid,
just a little quick thing.

20:45.962 --> 20:48.089
Can you bring me back down to Earth,

20:48.173 --> 20:49.841
before I fly into the sun?

20:56.222 --> 20:59.100
- Is it time?
- It's time.

21:00.143 --> 21:02.520
This is gonna be a rough day, Stormfly.

21:02.603 --> 21:06.315
Whatever we have to face,
I'm glad we're facing it together.

21:08.651 --> 21:10.444
Hey, whatcha got there?

21:10.528 --> 21:14.115
Ta-da! Only the solution
to all our problems.

21:14.199 --> 21:16.492
I call Macey, but you can have
any of the others,

21:16.617 --> 21:18.661
except maybe this sword and this axe.

21:19.495 --> 21:22.207
Can't decide, huh?
Yeah, I can understand that.

21:22.289 --> 21:25.126
Tuff, these weapons
are all for close combat.

21:25.210 --> 21:28.838
If we get to that point,
there's two of us and we're done.

21:28.922 --> 21:31.758
- Oh. Well, no, I know that, but...
- Listen, we don't have time.

21:31.841 --> 21:33.259
Just do me one favor.

21:33.342 --> 21:35.095
- Fine, but...
- The ballista on my roof,

21:35.178 --> 21:36.971
you know how to use it, right?

21:37.055 --> 21:39.265
Uh, it's a massively
destructive weapon, isn't it?

21:39.348 --> 21:42.852
It is. So, get up there,
and massively destroy things.

21:42.936 --> 21:45.396
But on my command, not before.
Got it?

21:45.479 --> 21:47.398
Got it.
Come on, Macey.

22:04.624 --> 22:07.252
You feel the air?
That's fear.

22:07.752 --> 22:10.421
Soon... it'll be death.
