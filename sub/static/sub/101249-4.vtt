WEBVTT

00:13.638 --> 00:15.557
FREEMAN:
Stardate 57538.9.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.393
The Cerritos is working
alongside the USS Merced

00:18.476 --> 00:20.395
in the relocation
of an ancient generation ship,

00:20.478 --> 00:22.272
which,
due to some unknown calamity,

00:22.355 --> 00:23.940
never reached its destination.

00:24.023 --> 00:26.901
Her crew, adrift for centuries,

00:26.985 --> 00:28.903
mummified
in disabled cryo units.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.780
Their most precious cargo--

00:30.864 --> 00:32.949
mysterious containers
of molecular fluid

00:33.032 --> 00:35.744
which generates life
from inorganic material.

00:35.827 --> 00:38.913
We suspect they planned
to use it on a dead planet

00:38.997 --> 00:40.457
to create
a habitable environment

00:40.540 --> 00:41.791
they could call home.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.293
The Merced is here

00:43.376 --> 00:44.961
to ensure the generation ship
is preserved

00:45.044 --> 00:46.588
during transportation,

00:46.671 --> 00:49.424
and I want everyone
to give them full support.

00:49.507 --> 00:50.967
Captain Durango
and I both served

00:51.050 --> 00:52.802
on the Illinois many years ago,

00:52.886 --> 00:56.097
and it is a true delight to be
able to work with him again.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.640
(yawning)

00:57.724 --> 00:59.309
Trouble sleeping, Ensign?

00:59.392 --> 01:01.603
No, I slept great. I mean,
maybe too good, honestly.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.605
Just distribute the PADDs.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.482
Starfleet believes
this alien vessel

01:05.565 --> 01:08.318
is equipped with unique
terraforming technology:

01:08.401 --> 01:11.321
an elemental fluid
which can transform inert matter

01:11.404 --> 01:13.114
into a living ecosystem.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.825
Towing it will be
a delicate procedure.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.203
Even the slightest flux
in tractor beam

01:18.286 --> 01:19.829
stabilization could damage...

01:19.913 --> 01:21.831
(yawning)

01:21.915 --> 01:23.666
Oh. Oh, I am so sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.959
It is just so much information.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.669
I don't know
how you guys aren't yawning.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.839
(scoffs) Your crew doesn't
appear to appreciate the gravity

01:29.923 --> 01:31.216
of our undertaking, Captain.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.759
I assure you, Captain,

01:32.842 --> 01:34.677
my people are the best
in the fleet.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.262
They're proficient, alert and...

01:36.346 --> 01:37.889
-(yawning)
-(scoffs) Mariner!

01:37.972 --> 01:39.933
I am trying to hold it in!

01:40.016 --> 01:41.851
(yawning)

01:44.103 --> 01:46.147
♪ ♪

02:03.540 --> 02:05.542
♪ ♪

02:39.993 --> 02:41.995
♪ ♪

02:53.882 --> 02:55.425
MARINER:
Ugh!

02:55.508 --> 02:57.051
I had to yawn, okay?
I'm sorry.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.387
That guy is super boring.
Like, "Oh, I'm boring.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.432
I love museums
and dust and old gates."

03:02.515 --> 03:04.934
I know he's boring.
He's been boring for 15 years!

03:05.018 --> 03:07.228
But right now, he's telling
everyone on the Merced

03:07.312 --> 03:09.522
that I don't have the respect
of my crew.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.566
If you ever
disrespect me like that again,

03:11.649 --> 03:14.277
I'll skip the court-martial
and blow you out the airlock.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.988
Cool.
Well, live long and prosper.

03:17.071 --> 03:20.116
Don't you give me
that sarcastic Vulcan salute!

03:20.199 --> 03:22.577
Beckett!

03:22.660 --> 03:24.829
Captain, I have the sensor data
that you requested.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.915
Huh? Oh, right. The sensors.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.792
Ugh. I'm sorry, Jack.
It's just Ensign Mariner.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.086
Ugh. I feel like
she stays up all night

03:32.170 --> 03:34.005
coming up with new ways
to piss me off.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.633
I honestly don't know why you
haven't kicked her off the ship.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.843
(clears throat)
But since it's not my job

03:38.927 --> 03:40.303
to question your motives...

03:40.386 --> 03:41.804
If you want to avoid conflict,

03:41.888 --> 03:43.848
why not reassign her
to all the worst jobs?

03:43.932 --> 03:46.809
That way, transferring
would be her idea, not yours.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.311
Hmm.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.812
Well, we could reassign her

03:49.896 --> 03:52.190
to all the nastiest jobs
on the ship.

03:52.273 --> 03:55.652
That way, transferring her
would be her idea, not mine.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.488
Brilliant plan.
That's why you're the captain.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.239
Assignment time!

04:00.323 --> 04:01.950
Hatchi machi! (gasps)

04:02.033 --> 04:04.827
I got conference room
cleanup duty. In your face!

04:04.911 --> 04:06.746
-Last time I checked,
that was very lame.
-(humming)

04:06.829 --> 04:08.665
Why would you dance?
That's not a danceable job.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.500
That's where all the
senior officer action happens!

04:10.583 --> 04:12.835
Plus, they have access to better
replicator programs than we do,

04:12.919 --> 04:14.629
and sometimes
they let you eat with them!

04:14.712 --> 04:15.713
It's, like,
basically the same food.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.215
No, it's not!

04:17.298 --> 04:18.675
They get, like,
gnocchi and fritters and...

04:18.758 --> 04:20.301
Doesn't matter.
It's good, okay?

04:20.385 --> 04:21.844
-(PADD chirping)
-Oh, man. I got to monitor

04:21.928 --> 04:23.846
power fluctuations
in the tractor beam?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.473
I wanted
to monitor power fluctuations

04:25.556 --> 04:27.058
in the impulse relays.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.893
Rutherford! I'm about
to go watch an ascension.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.145
What? That's amazing!
What's an ascension?

04:31.229 --> 04:32.605
Some people who master the art

04:32.689 --> 04:34.482
of alien meditation
can achieve inner peace.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.109
Then they transcend
the physical realm

04:36.192 --> 04:38.403
and become a being
of pure energy.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.989
-Isn't that cool?
-Oh, like a Q or a the Traveler?

04:41.072 --> 04:43.658
No! It's more like studying
so much for a test

04:43.741 --> 04:45.410
that you literally
become the test.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.787
(laughs)
You become everything!

04:47.870 --> 04:48.871
Damn, that is cool.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.332
I can't believe I actually get
to see it in person!

04:51.416 --> 04:52.709
I wonder
if it's gonna make a sound

04:52.792 --> 04:54.961
like "vrr" or "hmm" or "whoo."

04:55.044 --> 04:57.714
I guess I'll know soon!

04:57.797 --> 05:00.842
Anyway, let's see
what I got assigned.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.678
"Turbolift lubing,
holodeck waste removal

05:03.761 --> 05:05.847
and scraping carbon
off the carbon filter"?

05:05.930 --> 05:08.266
Ooh. Those are the worst jobs
on the ship.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.393
Scraping carbon off
of slightly harder carbon?

05:10.476 --> 05:12.020
That's Klingon prison stuff.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.688
This is weird.

05:13.771 --> 05:18.735
(meditative humming)

05:18.818 --> 05:20.194
(quietly):
Wow.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.696
(laughing softly):
Wow.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.072
Oh.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.575
(meditative humming)

05:25.658 --> 05:27.910
As I grow closer
to decorporation,

05:27.994 --> 05:30.413
words start to lose meaning.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.040
(meditative humming)

05:32.123 --> 05:33.583
Hey, are-are we supposed
to join in?

05:33.666 --> 05:36.085
Hmm...

05:36.169 --> 05:38.254
(gasps)
A tzutchian gong?!

05:38.337 --> 05:40.423
(meditative humming)

05:40.506 --> 05:42.258
(humming continues)

05:42.341 --> 05:43.718
-Oh.
-(sneezes)
-MAN: What's happening?

05:43.801 --> 05:44.761
-WOMAN: Is he ascending?
-MAN 2: I think he's ascending.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.055
-WOMAN: He's ascending.
-Really?! No, no, no, no!

05:47.138 --> 05:49.724
-(grunts)
-(gong clangs)

05:49.807 --> 05:52.560
-Aah!
-(gasps) My sand mandala!

05:52.643 --> 05:54.729
-No, no, no, no!
-I can fix it! I can fix it!

05:54.812 --> 05:57.231
I've been laying that
for two years!

05:57.315 --> 06:00.068
It was a physical representation
of my inner calm!

06:00.151 --> 06:01.402
No, no, it's gonna--
it's gonna be totally fine.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.737
Just keep ascending! Computer,

06:02.820 --> 06:05.239
colorful sand, room temperature.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.450
Well, uh... there.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.118
See? It's-it's... it's all good.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.413
We're good. We're good.
It's fine. Uh...

06:12.497 --> 06:13.748
If I had known I was going

06:13.831 --> 06:15.208
to be emptying
the holodeck biofilters,

06:15.291 --> 06:16.459
I wouldn't have had so much
for breakfast.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.086
Welp, have fun
with your terrible jobs.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.420
I got to go clean
the executive conference room

06:19.504 --> 06:21.464
and eat some lobster ravioli.
Peace.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.299
Uh, no. Uh-uh. Sorry.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.760
It does not look cool
when you do it.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.970
Damn it, it does.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.764
-(grumbling)
-(beeping)

06:32.558 --> 06:34.936
(grunts, gags, groans)

06:37.730 --> 06:39.482
Ugh.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.320
(gasps) Computer,
emergency stop turbolift nine!

06:44.403 --> 06:46.405
(groans, spits)

06:46.489 --> 06:47.949
Ugh!
Hey, I'm working up here!

06:48.032 --> 06:49.325
SHAXS:
Sorry.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.785
(groaning)

06:54.038 --> 06:57.166
(muttering)

06:57.250 --> 07:00.336
Oh, this is the worst!
Oh, wait a minute.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.004
Hey, buddy, do you want
to make this interesting?

07:02.088 --> 07:04.382
How? Like, bet on who can finish
their piece first?

07:04.465 --> 07:06.050
-Yeah.
-All right, sure. Why not?

07:06.134 --> 07:07.343
Yeah, I'll get in on that.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.846
(cheering)

07:09.929 --> 07:14.559
(laughs)
All right! Hell yeah!

07:14.642 --> 07:18.437
Syncing tractor beams
in three, two, one.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.403
Whoa. I was wrong.
These fluctuations are great.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.613
Aw, man,
look at these amplitudes!

07:29.448 --> 07:30.992
(footsteps approaching)

07:31.075 --> 07:34.495
Hi. Um, I just... I feel
terrible about the... you know.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.747
Don't worry about it.
Don't talk to me.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.834
Anyway, I went
and found a Hiverian metronome,

07:39.917 --> 07:41.294
and apparently,
if you just relax

07:41.377 --> 07:43.004
and let it sync
to your biorhythm,

07:43.087 --> 07:45.840
we can get you back on track
and ascending by this afternoon!

07:45.923 --> 07:48.843
You think I can realign a decade
of spiritual enlightenment

07:48.926 --> 07:50.344
by this afternoon?!

07:50.428 --> 07:51.846
Tomorrow morning at the latest.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.264
You just have
to find your calm. Ah!

07:53.347 --> 07:55.266
I... don't... want...

07:55.349 --> 07:57.727
your... help!

08:00.771 --> 08:03.024
Has Mariner submitted
her transfer request?

08:03.107 --> 08:05.359
(chuckles)
I'm going to frame it.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.069
She's... having a great time.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.696
-What?!
-She's finding little ways

08:08.779 --> 08:11.490
to inject joy
into otherwise horrible tasks.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.034
Then give her worse jobs.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.535
I've got her emptying (bleep)

08:14.619 --> 08:16.287
out of the holodeck's
(bleep) filter!

08:18.289 --> 08:20.416
Ugh.
People really use it for that?

08:20.499 --> 08:21.918
Oh, yeah, it's mostly that.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.753
Oh, if she finds a way
to enjoy that,

08:23.836 --> 08:26.422
then what the hell are we gonna
do to get her to resign?

08:26.505 --> 08:27.757
I don't know,
but there has to be

08:27.840 --> 08:29.759
something
on this ship she hates.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.763
Hmm...

08:33.846 --> 08:38.059
Ensign Mariner,
report to Conference Room Five.

08:43.564 --> 08:46.234
Whoa-hoa,
another conference room meeting?

08:46.317 --> 08:48.861
Shocker. You guys debating
the Prime Directive again?

08:48.945 --> 08:50.947
Pretty fascinating stuff.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.907
-(laughter)
-What is...?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.116
No, no. No laughing.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.326
I was making fun of you,
not with you.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.620
Well, since you're one
of us now,

08:57.703 --> 09:00.289
I guess you're making fun
of yourself.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.123
What?

09:01.207 --> 09:03.960
-(shudders): No.
-Ensign Beckett Mariner,

09:04.043 --> 09:07.129
-No, no, no, no.
-I am pleased to grant you
a promotion.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.339
No!

09:08.422 --> 09:10.424
Congratulations,
Lieutenant Mariner.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.009
BOIMLER (gasps):
Lieutenant?

09:12.093 --> 09:13.844
Lieu... Lieu... Lieutenant?

09:13.928 --> 09:15.596
Looking forward
to serving with you

09:15.680 --> 09:18.307
for a long, long time.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.768
Good job, Mariner.
Well earned, well earned.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.019
(stammering)

09:22.103 --> 09:23.938
(gasps)
This is real! This is real!

09:24.021 --> 09:26.148
Wow! Thanks.
I'm gonna take off.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.610
Oh, right after this
very important meeting.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.654
All right, meeting's started.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.990
We need to choose
new conference room chairs.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.492
A beige chair with a leather
strip right down the middle.

09:36.575 --> 09:38.869
T'ANA:
Hey! We all agree
that a strip of leather

09:38.953 --> 09:40.371
is too ostentatious.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.373
We did not all agree.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.500
RANSOM:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened to the barstools?

09:44.583 --> 09:45.584
SHAXS:
Barstools hurt my back.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.295
BILLUPS (sighs): You're
not sitting on them right.

09:47.378 --> 09:48.462
SHAXS:
Not sitting on them right?

09:48.546 --> 09:50.464
I've killed better men for less.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.551
-No, you haven't.
-Well, I've threatened

18:30.818 --> 18:32.611
You did not
just call me "Carol."

18:32.694 --> 18:34.321
Whatever, Carol.

18:34.404 --> 18:35.697
(both gasp)

18:38.659 --> 18:40.327
(Tendi grunts)

18:40.410 --> 18:41.870
(both yell)

18:41.954 --> 18:43.330
Oh, no, this is it!

18:43.413 --> 18:45.082
(inhales deeply)

18:54.091 --> 18:57.094
(both yell)

18:57.177 --> 18:58.136
-(both gasp)
-(alarm sounds)

18:58.220 --> 18:59.680
(O'Connor chuckles)

18:59.763 --> 19:02.266
-Ah.
-(rumbling)

19:03.642 --> 19:05.394
No! (grunts)

19:05.477 --> 19:07.437
-(alarm sounding)
-(gasps) Aah! No!

19:07.521 --> 19:09.356
(grunting)

19:09.439 --> 19:10.899
Get out of here!

19:10.983 --> 19:13.443
I'll be okay.
You need to save yourself.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.070
No way.
I'm not leaving you!

19:15.153 --> 19:16.947
Tendi, it's okay.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.740
I did this for you.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.243
No!

19:22.619 --> 19:25.038
Yes! The systems
are still on line.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.916
Affected areas are saturated
with carbon polymer dust.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.586
We need Parizene gas. Flood the
ship, then trigger a reversion

19:30.669 --> 19:32.588
with radiation
from the main deflector.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.923
Unless you think
we should use a pointier rock.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.427
No, that's... exactly what
I was going to suggest.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.887
I'm just impressed.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.889
You read my mission brief,
didn't you?

19:41.972 --> 19:44.057
No. I... No.
Well, I mean, maybe a little,

19:44.141 --> 19:46.435
but just ironically,
just so I could make fun of it.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.812
Uh-huh. Okay.
Computer, hit it.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.230
COMPUTER:
Hitting it.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.816
(hissing)

19:59.448 --> 20:00.908
(laughs)

20:00.991 --> 20:03.160
Oh, my gosh.
We're gonna be okay!

20:03.243 --> 20:05.412
Holy (bleep).
I was so ready to die.

20:05.495 --> 20:06.914
You saved my life.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.415
You saved mine first.

20:08.498 --> 20:11.793
(Tendi moans softly)

20:11.877 --> 20:13.629
-(gasps)
-Oh, no. What's happening?!

20:13.712 --> 20:15.464
-Oh, my gosh, you're ascending!
-(groaning)

20:15.547 --> 20:17.174
I am? I am!

20:17.257 --> 20:18.759
-Oh. Ah!
-It must have been
when you saved me!

20:18.842 --> 20:20.135
When you were willing
to sacrifice yourself for me!

20:20.218 --> 20:21.762
I pretended to be finding myself

20:21.845 --> 20:24.431
for so long,
I guess I actually did!

20:24.514 --> 20:25.933
I... Ow. Ooh, okay. Wow.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.309
Oh, that actually burns.
(inhales sharply)

20:27.392 --> 20:28.810
Uh, is this supposed
to be happening?

20:28.894 --> 20:30.520
-Uh-oh. Okay, you're smoking.
-It burns.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.064
It burns! Aah! Help!

20:32.147 --> 20:33.565
Oh, I don't...
I don't want to ascend!

20:33.649 --> 20:35.359
-(screams)
-Drop and roll!

20:35.442 --> 20:37.945
Drop and roll! Drop back
into the physical and roll.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.488
-Drop back into the physical
and roll!
-Aah!

20:39.571 --> 20:40.948
Time has no meaning!

20:41.031 --> 20:42.324
Aah! No, it's happening!

20:42.407 --> 20:44.159
I'm everywhere and nowhere!

20:44.242 --> 20:46.328
I can see everything!

20:46.411 --> 20:48.789
I'm turning into pure energy!

20:48.872 --> 20:50.666
-Why is it taking so long?!
-Aah!

20:50.749 --> 20:52.960
Aah! I see Abraham Lincoln!

20:53.043 --> 20:56.463
The universe is balanced
on the back of a giant koala!

20:56.546 --> 20:59.633
Why is he smiling?
What does he know?

20:59.716 --> 21:02.886
The secret... of... life is...

21:02.970 --> 21:05.263
(screaming)

21:07.599 --> 21:11.228
Uh, all right. Well, good luck
being everything.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.146
Sorry I helped.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.315
-Ransom, report.
-All systems stable, Captain.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.317
But the Merced--
she had far greater exposure

21:17.401 --> 21:18.568
to the terraform cloud.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.570
Her life support's critical.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.531
Oh, man. At-at this point,
they need a whole new ship.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.992
Or... a whole old one.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.411
Initiating emergency transport
for all crew

21:27.494 --> 21:29.204
of the Merced
to the generation ship.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.747
Beam them
into the stasis chamber.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.125
It's still sealed off
and should be safe.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.710
Huh. Durango should be
right at home

21:34.793 --> 21:37.045
with some dusty old mummies.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.427
(whooshing)

21:45.721 --> 21:47.347
Oh, my gosh, we did it.
We did it!

21:47.431 --> 21:49.433
All crew accounted for!

22:03.155 --> 22:05.282
RANSOM:
Captain Freeman,
Admiral Vassery is on his way.

22:05.365 --> 22:06.700
Very good.

22:06.783 --> 22:08.660
I'm really glad
we found a way to work together.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.037
Yeah, you know,
it's a nice change of pace.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.413
Going for each other's jugulars

22:11.496 --> 22:12.789
all the time is
kind of exhausting.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.917
-I'm proud of you.
-Oh. Thanks, Mom.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.378
Maybe you are fit to be one
of my senior officers.

22:18.462 --> 22:22.549
Your chair right next to mine,
spending all our time together,

22:22.632 --> 22:24.718
an unstoppable
mommy-daughter team!

22:24.801 --> 22:26.386
(door whooshes open)

22:26.470 --> 22:29.222
Admiral Vassery,
welcome to the Cerritos.

22:29.306 --> 22:32.601
Starfleet commends your bravery
and ingenuity.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.395
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back to work.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.064
Apparently, we've picked up
a strange signal

22:37.147 --> 22:38.398
on our sense-oars.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.941
Quite all right, Admiral.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.735
And what did
your sense-oars show?

22:41.818 --> 22:44.237
Well, nothing at first,
but the long-range

22:44.321 --> 22:45.739
-sense-oars revealed...
-Whoa. Whoa.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.574
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. I am sorry.

22:47.657 --> 22:50.118
Are you trying to say the word
"sensors," 'cause to me,

22:50.202 --> 22:52.079
you're saying "sense-oars."
What is that?

22:52.162 --> 22:54.122
That's how it's said.
"Sense-oars."

22:54.206 --> 22:57.250
-Everyone knows that.
-Sense-oars. Sense-oars.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.585
Yes, that's right.
It sounds right to me.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.087
Me, too.
I say it like that.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.755
What? No, you don't.
This is nuts.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.256
Yo, she's making fun of you,
dummy.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.758
She doesn't say "sense-oars."

23:04.841 --> 23:06.593
Well, of course I do.
(whispers): Stop it.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.470
Is this
how your crew treats authority

23:08.553 --> 23:10.597
when it's known
I mispronounce things?

23:10.680 --> 23:12.140
Are you really
making fawn of me?

23:12.224 --> 23:13.600
Admiral, no.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.310
I thought we came
to an understanding.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.437
Uh, maybe you need
to adjust your "sense-oars."

23:17.521 --> 23:18.855
Would you just stop?

23:18.939 --> 23:21.024
I have never been shown
such disrespect and...

23:21.108 --> 23:23.485
-(yawning)
-Is she yawning?!

23:23.568 --> 23:25.320
You know,
when O'Connor was screaming

23:25.403 --> 23:27.322
and turning into energy,
it made me realize

23:27.405 --> 23:29.324
that life's too short
to be hung up

23:29.407 --> 23:31.326
on whether everyone
on the ship likes me.

23:31.409 --> 23:33.495
That's great, 'cause I'm sure
there's at least a few

23:33.578 --> 23:34.955
-who don't.
-(both laugh)

23:35.038 --> 23:37.165
And who cares? Not me.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.959
So, who are these few people?
What did they say?

23:39.042 --> 23:40.669
Do they not like me?
You know what? I don't care.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.254
But if someone said something,
I feel like I should know.

23:42.337 --> 23:43.338
Who was it?!

23:43.421 --> 23:45.423
(gasps)
Where's your pip?

23:45.507 --> 23:47.509
Uh, I'm pretty good
at getting demoted.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.010
In the last hour?!

23:49.094 --> 23:50.512
Uh, yeah. Apparently,
the captain doesn't like

23:50.595 --> 23:52.180
looking stupid
in front of an admiral, so...

23:52.264 --> 23:53.849
What I... But I-I can't.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.309
You-you had everything
that I ever wanted in life,

23:56.393 --> 23:58.687
and you didn't even care!
How are we even friends?

23:58.770 --> 24:01.648
Maybe because I still have
the senior officer access card

24:01.731 --> 24:03.358
for the good
replicator programs.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.361
Oh! I'm gonna get that macaroni
and cheese with the breaded top!

24:06.444 --> 24:11.158
