00:03.960 --> 00:05.640
I turned Cameron into a tree.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.480
I can't be around you.
It was me who cursed you.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.640
I wanted you to be with your mom.

(Everine) Circle page...
What is Circle Page?

00:13.840 --> 00:16.160
It’s a kind of guard.
It’s mostly ceremonial.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.400
You must give us
three Fated villagers to inhabit.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.000
Where is the third? Where is our sister?

00:22.160 --> 00:24.640
(ESMERELDA)
The lantern was smashed in two.

00:24.840 --> 00:25.960
You can't fix it.

Without golden thread,
there’s nothing I can do.

It worked. We have our own spider.

(TARA) Cameron!

01:19.640 --> 01:23.160
You’re going to get me in trouble!
I’m not allowed to talk to you!

01:23.360 --> 01:26.400
Something’s wrong with Flynn. He’s quiet.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.760
You mean for a spider?

01:28.920 --> 01:32.840
I get a vibe from him, okay?
I need to know what happened.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.960
I’m coming around. We need to look
at that cocoon he was wrapped up in.

01:37.080 --> 01:41.200
No! Do not come over. I mean it.
Mom will ground me for eternity.

Circle Page challenge day, isn’t that
right, Cameron? Are you nervous?

02:02.600 --> 02:07.840
Every year the boys from the village get
to challenge the Circle Page for the role.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.200
I’m going to check upstairs.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.400
You’re avoiding school, aren’t you?

02:43.520 --> 02:47.000
You’re afraid someone
will take your Circle Page job.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.560
Actually, I’m afraid they won’t.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.200
Every year Doyle rejects all challengers,
so I can’t lose...

02:54.400 --> 02:56.920
He promised my mother
before she went missing.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.920
Okay, but you can resign, can’t you?

03:00.040 --> 03:01.600
I can choose a replacement.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.640

It’s very prestigious.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Today we have a letter
from a young Bella Crossley,

16:37.160 --> 16:40.600
who can’t get over a certain boy. Ahem!

16:40.760 --> 16:45.400
"Cameron, Cameron, my grand canyon,"

16:45.600 --> 16:50.040
I was the urban sophisticate.
You the local biscuit.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.680
Next time, bring muffins.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.760
Why does the universe hate me?

16:55.920 --> 16:57.560
(SIGHS)

16:59.040 --> 17:01.920
Did you just...
Yeah.

17:03.640 --> 17:04.640
Bella, no.

17:08.800 --> 17:13.120
(SIGHS) I’ll fix it,
but I have to go alone.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.440
(GIBBERING)

17:41.640 --> 17:43.240
This’ll fix it.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.880
Sorsha’s idea.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.920
You don’t mind if I go for Circle Page,
do you?

18:17.040 --> 18:22.520
I, uh, think you’d be perfect for it.
What about the junior matador here?

18:24.000 --> 18:28.600
I... don’t... want... the job.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.400
I think this is yours.

18:38.240 --> 18:41.240
You’re not supposed to see that!

18:41.400 --> 18:43.000
You wrote this?

18:43.160 --> 18:45.120
"Dear Mayor Doyle.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.880
It has been an honor
to serve as Circle Page...

18:49.000 --> 18:50.880
and fulfil my mother’s dream.

18:51.960 --> 18:57.600
But my mother had a bigger dream for me
and that was to be a regular teenager.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.160
So, I feel
I will be fulfilling her wishes,

19:02.320 --> 19:09.160
when I resign my post and nominate
Seb Crossley as my replacement."

19:12.400 --> 19:14.640
Your mother would be so proud.

19:24.040 --> 19:27.000
How did you know I wanted to resign?
I, um...

19:28.000 --> 19:29.720
I just sensed it.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.520
(TARA) Black thread?

19:48.640 --> 19:52.320
Cameron, I think someone kidnapped
your spider and made magic thread.

19:52.520 --> 19:55.680
If someone’s making thread...

19:55.840 --> 19:58.000
Then someone’s weaving thread...

20:05.840 --> 20:07.600
What is that?

20:07.760 --> 20:12.280
A prediction of the worst kind,
destruction.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.160
The destruction of the village.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.640
Next time on The Evermoor Chronicles...

20:21.800 --> 20:25.400
We used to dream of this day,
going to the prom and seeing the boys.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.320
I want tonight to be perfect.
The prom’s my first date with Sorsha.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.040
The tapestry's been attacked.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.400
Tapestry o tapestry,

20:33.600 --> 20:37.720
please send us Evermoor’s greatest
Circle Page to save our prom night.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.920
If he touches your dad...
It’s good night, Evermoor.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.120
(ESMERELDA)
Doom is coming to Evermoor.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.320
Whoopsie!
