WEBVTT

00:06.966 --> 00:10.379
All right,
we have Davis McAlary in the house,

00:10.511 --> 00:13.548
famous and infamous
for many of our long—time OZ listeners.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.637
And we have a new voice, Lil Calliope,

00:19.645 --> 00:22.057
Hey, man, good to be here.
Good to be here.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.397
- Me too.
— Yeah. And you're here...

00:24.525 --> 00:27.858
Y'all are here with a new track,
Road Home, which we're gonna play.

00:27.987 --> 00:32.481
- Tell us something about it.
— Right, this is our contribution to a sampler

00:32.617 --> 00:35.825
which marks the debut of a new label
here in New Orleans,

00:35.953 --> 00:37.614
'58 Mercury Monterey Records.

00:37.747 --> 00:40.534
— Gonna drop in a couple of weeks.
- Hmm. Uh, hip-hop?

00:40.666 --> 00:44.409
And brass and funk and everything else
your mama warned you about.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.833
Big Freedia, Katey Red, Ballzack,
10th Ward Buck.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.047
We even got Mannie Fresh
throwing down with us, man.

00:50.176 --> 00:52.667
— Well, who fronts you?
— Uh, that would...

00:52.803 --> 00:54.714
— Sorry.
— Uh... I killed this one.

00:54.847 --> 00:57.133
Split the vocals with Davis.

00:57.266 --> 01:00.599
I wrote, arranged and produced,

01:00.728 --> 01:03.014
but all props to Lil Calliope.

01:03.147 --> 01:07.891
I am awed to be presenting him here at OZ
for the first time.

01:08.027 --> 01:11.895
Well, it's good to represent and present.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.443
Right, brah. Um...

01:15.576 --> 01:17.817
And as you can tell by the title of the track,

01:17.954 --> 01:20.866
we're taking this whole New Orleans
brass—funk—bounce thing

01:20.998 --> 01:22.329
to a place it's never been before.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.823
And that would be?

01:23.960 --> 01:28.579
Musical insurrection. DJ Davis
and the Brassy Knoll exists as political dissent,

01:28.714 --> 01:31.922
and we will not rest until the entire
Who Dat Nation is exactly that.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.882
Because you know what
Katrina made clear?

01:34.011 --> 01:36.423
I'm no longer from
the United States of America.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.262
Right. OK.

01:39.392 --> 01:42.759
Uh, I got a second thing
I wanna lay on you.

01:44.689 --> 01:46.645
A track called The True,
recorded this week.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.140
That's another heavy political statement,
I take it?

01:49.277 --> 01:51.893
— No, no, it's more of a club banger.
— No, no, no, no, no. Yeah.

01:52.029 --> 01:55.942
Me and Don B put it together
and Kirk Joseph worked up a nasty horn riff.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.407
— Check it out.
— Yeah, it's more of like a dance track.

01:58.536 --> 02:00.902
— It's not really gonna be on the sampler.
— OK. Right.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.869
We'll give this a listen later
if we have time.

02:02.999 --> 02:08.915
But right now it's time for the debut of Road
Home by DJ Davis and the Brassy Knoll.

02:09.046 --> 02:11.253
(Music playing)

02:11.382 --> 02:12.963
That was good.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.550
What's he doing here?

02:21.517 --> 02:23.348
I'm the talent.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.149
(Laughs) I love it.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.151
(Man on TV) Start your day out there.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.121
(Woman on TV) Uh—huh. We were talking
about the fact that a picture

04:09.250 --> 04:14.244
is worth a thousand... Then this one, probably
a million words when you're looking at...

04:14.380 --> 04:16.962
- Imagine that.
— (TV) We do have a little bit of showers...

04:17.091 --> 04:18.956
Get dressed proper in the morning,

04:19.093 --> 04:21.334
strap on your shoes,

04:21.470 --> 04:24.303
off to work, like most folks.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.590
(Woman on TV continues speaking)

04:27.726 --> 04:32.561
I'm telling you, it's damn near time
you start putting yourself back together.

04:33.357 --> 04:36.941
Sitting up at night with a bottle
does nothing but kill your next day.

04:37.069 --> 04:41.312
Your sons need to see you wide awake
and fresh when they get up in the morning.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.738
You know how I feel about that goddamn bar,
especially after what happened.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.703
I hate that fucking place,
but I hate you on this sofa even more.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.412
(Slams glass down)

04:50.541 --> 04:51.576
(Turns TV off)

04:51.709 --> 04:54.041
— So what you asking?
- I'm telling.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.081
Either you reopen that bar,
you go back to work,

04:56.213 --> 04:59.000
or we sell that fucking thing
and you bring your ass back up here

04:59.133 --> 05:01.089
and be a part of this family like you should.

05:01.218 --> 05:04.551
One or the other, but either way
I need you up off your ass!

05:08.434 --> 05:12.473
Got a meeting with the district attorney
day after tomorrow, so...

05:14.315 --> 05:15.646
l'll reopen then.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.857
— What?
— Where the hell you supposed to stay?

05:18.986 --> 05:22.194
We closing your mama's house in two weeks.
You can't move no furniture back in there.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.154
— I'll stay above the bar.
- The hell you will.

05:24.283 --> 05:26.490
Then I'll get a hotel room.

05:26.619 --> 05:27.608
Downtown.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.781
On Canal Street, a'ight?

05:37.046 --> 05:39.037
(Door slams)

05:39.173 --> 05:41.539
— Do we know who the judge is, Bob?
— Not yet.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.838
But we did draw Ted Planzos
for the prosecution.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.177
Now, I don't want to be optimistic here,

05:47.306 --> 05:51.891
but my experience with Planzos says
that he's reasonable at the very least.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.806
— Any chance of getting this tossed?
— Frankly, no.

05:54.939 --> 05:58.227
The fact that it's in Jefferson Parish
means it goes forward.

05:58.359 --> 06:01.772
Now, the good news is that they're gonna
go after the kid with the heroin charge,

06:01.904 --> 06:04.236
so if we do everything
we're supposed to do,

06:04.365 --> 06:07.698
they'll most likely allow us to plea
and get probation.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.862
Once you complete your probation,

06:09.995 --> 06:12.031
they'll most likely go back
and clear your record.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.246
(Toni) How about a court date?

06:14.375 --> 06:17.788
Well, for juvenile it's 90 days from
date of offense, so this is good.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.002
It gives us time to prepare.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.872
It also gives time to get the blue streaks
out of your hair.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.499
I'd also like you to get
some sort of after—school job,

06:25.636 --> 06:27.718
something that shows
you're busy and contributing.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.758
She already has an internship
with the city council president

06:30.891 --> 06:32.301
three days a week after school.

06:32.434 --> 06:36.177
The more extracurriculars, the better,
so do something with the other two weekdays.

06:36.313 --> 06:40.352
We need to convey the impression that
you're a reasonably responsible person

06:40.484 --> 06:43.601
who made a mistake
that was totally out of character.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.854
Now, to do that I'm gonna have you
take some drug tests at a lab.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.573
You want me to pee in a cup?

06:49.702 --> 06:51.363
- God.
— Sofia.

06:52.121 --> 06:54.487
I wasn't even using. The stuff was just...

06:56.750 --> 06:59.287
And the marijuana was yours.
You have been smoking weed.

06:59.420 --> 07:03.254
In addition, l've arranged for weekly meetings
with Dana Weinstein.

07:03.382 --> 07:06.340
She's a child psychologist | work with.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.460
If all goes well, Dana will testify for us
when we go to court.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.804
— I'm not mental.
— Well, that's good to know,

07:11.932 --> 07:14.969
but we still need an expert
to say so to the judge.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.138
— Fuck this.
- Sofia!

07:17.271 --> 07:21.389
Toni. Give me a few minutes alone
with your daughter, please?

07:22.610 --> 07:24.601
I'm not a layman, Bob.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.318
I can be helpful here.

07:26.447 --> 07:29.029
| work a very specific pocket
of the courthouse

07:29.158 --> 07:30.739
and that's why you hired me.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.199
So, please, let me work.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.068
(Mouths)

07:41.879 --> 07:46.213
You're about to go to court
in Jefferson Parish, not Orleans.

07:46.342 --> 07:52.212
You piss someone off, it guarantees you won't
be going home to sleep in your own bed.

07:52.348 --> 07:56.387
So you're gonna do whatever I say to do...

07:56.518 --> 07:57.769
when I say it.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.010
Understood?

08:01.398 --> 08:04.435
Good. Sit up.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.650
(Sighs)

08:08.739 --> 08:10.730
J‘ l was born on a Dublin street

08:10.866 --> 08:12.822
J‘ Where the loyal drums did beat

08:12.951 --> 08:17.285
J‘ And the loving English feet,
they trampled over us

08:17.414 --> 08:19.029
J‘ And each and every night

08:19.166 --> 08:21.157
J‘ When me father came home tight

08:21.293 --> 08:25.662
J‘ He'd invite the neighbors outside
with this chorus

08:26.674 --> 08:28.164
J‘ Come out, ye Black and Tan

08:28.300 --> 08:30.336
J‘ Come out and fight me like a man

08:30.469 --> 08:34.963
J‘ Show the wife how you won medals
down in Flanders

08:35.099 --> 08:38.717
J‘ Tell her how the IRA
made you run like hell away

08:38.852 --> 08:43.186
J‘ From the green and lovely lanes
in Killashandra J‘

09:03.627 --> 09:05.333
(Annie) Whoo! Very cool.

09:05.462 --> 09:08.579
— You don't see a lot of those around here.
- I guess it's understandable.

09:08.716 --> 09:12.208
There's not much room for a pennywhistle solo
in the middle of a Fats Domino song.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.676
You could parade with it, though.
It's real portable.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.046
— l'm Annie Tee.
— Jim.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.013
Mr. Lynch is visiting me from London

09:19.143 --> 09:22.886
where he is a street entertainer
of long standing, much like ourselves.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.728
Me and Jim worked a summer together
a couple of years back.

09:25.858 --> 09:29.476
I had to learn all that Tommy Makem shite
and he got schooled in Hank Williams.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.772
We were a lovely pair
of three—chord wonders.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.487
— So you're gonna busk here awhile?
— Just for a couple of weeks.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.699
I came down for the St Patrick's Day things.
Harley kept going on about it.

09:37.828 --> 09:41.116
Is it true they chuck cabbages
at people's heads off of parade floats?

09:41.248 --> 09:42.158
Yeah. (Laughs)

09:42.291 --> 09:43.872
Really? That's fucking mental.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.788
I came by to see if you wanted to work
the square this afternoon.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.162
— I could use the pocket money.
— l was gonna show him the town today,

09:50.299 --> 09:52.961
- but how about tonight?
— (Annie) I will see you there after dark.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.300
- All right.
— All right. It was nice to meet you.

09:56.180 --> 09:58.842
— Very pretty.
— Plays her ass off too.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.260
Annie Tee...remember that name, brah.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.349
- For real.
— I sure will.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.398
- (Phone ringing)
— Colson, hold on.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.860
I came by to let you know that
Marsden not only shitcanned Girardi,

10:13.989 --> 10:16.446
but he transferred my lieutenant,
Eddie Corrigan.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.783
Gone, as of this morning.
Good fucking job, Terry.

10:19.912 --> 10:21.618
— You're blaming me?
— You ran your mouth, right?

10:21.747 --> 10:24.534
You guys fucked the dog
on the Helen Hill thing. You know this.

10:24.666 --> 10:27.248
I don't come into your shop
and second—guess, motherfucker.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.505
And I sure as shit don't run up the back stairs
to the deputy chief.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.801
You been reading the Times—Pic lately?

10:34.927 --> 10:39.011
Big article on drug use at Lusher
and that one kid who overdosed.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.800
Real problem they got.

10:40.933 --> 10:44.471
Captain Guidry, shouldn't you
be out somewhere fouling evidence?

10:44.603 --> 10:48.187
Funny. I hear the daughter
of your lawyer friend caught bracelets.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.682
- My lawyer friend?
— Word gets around about you, Terry.

10:51.819 --> 10:55.152
Bernette, right?
The one with the red hair.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.191
Her kid got popped for H.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.235
Fucking tragic.

10:59.368 --> 11:00.858
But you guys are right for each other.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.986
That's another one that likes to get involved
with everybody else's business

11:04.122 --> 11:06.659
and pretend their own shit smells like roses.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.002
Lieutenant, for you from Chief Marsden.

11:13.131 --> 11:16.965
— Ca|| him ASAP.
— (Door opens, closes)

11:21.807 --> 11:23.547
(J‘ Fever)

11:29.898 --> 11:31.434
(Lecoeur) Horns up.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.026
All right, let's go.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.699
— Crescendo.
— (Vocalizes)

11:56.258 --> 11:58.499
(Vocalizes)

11:58.635 --> 11:59.670
Accent.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.760
— (Music stops)
— All right, all right.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.513
- Not bad.
— It sounded good to me.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.061
Actually, Denard,
you were a half—measure behind.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.933
(Kids jeering)

12:17.070 --> 12:18.185
(Laughs)

12:18.322 --> 12:22.110
— (Antoine) Hey, hey.
— l was improvising, so I could stand out some.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.528
A band is about being in lockstep
with the other players.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.946
— Marching band, you mean.
- Yes.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.286
I wanna be in one of them bands
where you can play free.

12:28.415 --> 12:33.125
What? Y'all ain't even up on two feet yet.
Y'all getting there, but y'all ain't there yet.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.414
This is the path right here.

12:35.547 --> 12:38.710
Every New Orleans jazz musician
came out of a school band.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.833
— It's how you learn.
— Mr. Batiste.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.425
- Yeah.
— You was in one?

12:42.554 --> 12:44.590
(Vocalizes)

12:45.974 --> 12:47.589
St Augustine Marching 100.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.762
— (Laughter)
— (Robert) Where you playing now?

12:49.895 --> 12:52.887
Oh, all over. Different gigs, you know,
some with my own band.

12:53.023 --> 12:55.639
Tomorrow I'm playing down
at the Blue Nile on Frenchmen Street.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.518
— Could we see you?
— I don't know. I mean, it's mostly adults.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.896
— It ain't no place for kids.
— They got women in those clubs, right?

13:03.033 --> 13:04.864
— Yeah.
— You get with some?

13:04.993 --> 13:07.860
— Oh no. (Mutters)
— (Bell ringing)

13:07.996 --> 13:09.657
— (Drum beat)
- Charles.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.327
— How many girlfriends you got, Mr. Baptiste?
- Come here.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.324
You were tight—lipped on the phone, Deputy.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.827
— I hope I'm not in thejackpot here.
— No jackpot.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.501
| just wanted to tell you in person.

13:19.633 --> 13:22.966
We're moving you over to Homicide,
effective immediately.

13:23.095 --> 13:25.632
There's an opening for a lieutenant in the unit.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.130
I think you're the right choice for the posting.

13:28.266 --> 13:31.599
Now, your criticism of the handling
of the Hill case was on point.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.514
So once there in an official capacity,

13:33.647 --> 13:36.639
you can work on the things
that you think are deficient in the unit.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.228
There are others in the department

13:39.361 --> 13:41.727
who have more investigative experience
than me, Deputy.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.650
But that didn't stop you
from speaking your mind before, did it?

13:45.784 --> 13:47.274
Um...

13:49.913 --> 13:53.826
ls, uh...Captain Guidry gonna remain
in command of Homicide?

13:53.959 --> 13:55.324
Yes.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.833
Well, Deputy, as you can imagine,

14:00.966 --> 14:04.550
John Guidry is not entirely enamored of me
at this moment.

14:04.678 --> 14:08.011
I spoke to the captain and he knows
that you'll be working together.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.764
Look, the department's got problems
everywhere, Lieutenant,

14:11.893 --> 14:15.056
but Homicide is where we are
truly and deeply fucked.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.053
One conviction, one,

14:17.190 --> 14:19.681
out of 162 murders last year.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.774
Here's your chance to do better.

14:21.903 --> 14:25.066
Do the job. You'll be fine.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.530
So what do you think, Darren?

14:30.662 --> 14:32.778
You've been doing this a long time.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.041
There's a lot of talent in this room.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.249
It's hard to say who'll go on.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.833
Too many outside factors —

14:38.962 --> 14:41.328
family, the street.

14:41.465 --> 14:45.003
Yeah, well, I guess what I'm asking is, uh...

14:45.844 --> 14:49.211
how do you know, as a teacher...

14:50.432 --> 14:53.219
which kid has the potential to stand out?

14:53.351 --> 14:55.478
I'm not here to teach one kid.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.435
This is about all of 'em.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.555
This is more than music, Antoine.

15:02.694 --> 15:05.436
(Albert) J‘ Coochie—mighty...

15:08.575 --> 15:11.658
J‘ Coochie—mighty

15:14.247 --> 15:18.991
J‘ l the big chief of Guardians of the Flame

15:20.879 --> 15:25.839
J‘ Mardi Gras day I shoot
the fiyo in the game

15:27.886 --> 15:30.673
J‘ I cry, "Hey, Mama!"

16:33.952 --> 16:36.159
J‘ Hu-ta-nay
J‘ Hey there, Mama

16:36.288 --> 16:38.745
J‘ Hu—ta—nay
J‘ Go tell your papa

16:38.874 --> 16:40.956
J‘ Hu—ta—nay
J‘ lndian's coming

16:41.084 --> 16:43.325
J‘ Hu—ta—nay
J‘ Somebody's running

16:43.461 --> 16:46.919
J‘ Hu—ta—nay, hu—ta—nay

16:48.383 --> 16:50.544
J‘ Hu—ta—nay... J‘

16:54.097 --> 16:55.303
(Music stops)

16:55.432 --> 16:58.424
— What the hell?
— Man. That was sounding good too, man.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.932
Dad, are you parched?
You need water or something?

17:03.064 --> 17:05.191
I don't need no damn water.

17:07.444 --> 17:10.151
Ron, I'm hearing you.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.324
Are you hearing me,

17:13.450 --> 17:15.816
or you don't want to hear me?

17:15.952 --> 17:19.740
I wanna feel the rhythm section.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.995
(Delmond) Whoa, whoa. Daddy. Daddy.
(Carl) Oh shit.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.164
(Chuckles) Yeah.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.670
You trying to show Ron Carter,

17:33.803 --> 17:36.795
who been the bottom on about 1,000
jazz recordings, how to play the bass?

17:36.932 --> 17:39.218
I'm trying to teach him some Indian, son.

17:39.351 --> 17:42.184
— I think I got this. I think I got this.
— (Albert) You know what I mean?

17:42.312 --> 17:44.928
— (Ron) I think I got it.
— You heard what I was doing.

17:47.484 --> 17:51.477
Trying to show Ron Carter
something on the bass

17:51.613 --> 17:54.525
is like trying to show
a ho how to turn a trick.

17:54.658 --> 17:57.240
- (Laughs)
— (Dr John) It's an impossible maneuver.

17:59.621 --> 18:02.237
Does this studio sound all right to y'all?

18:02.374 --> 18:05.491
- Huh?
— It was good enough for Rudy Van Gelder.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.788
Something ain't right here.

18:07.921 --> 18:11.664
Something just ain't...
It don't even smell right up here.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.260
(Delmond) You mean here in New York?

18:14.386 --> 18:17.549
— Well, yeah.
— Come on, Chief, man.

18:17.681 --> 18:22.266
We're musicians, man. We play notes that's
gonna sound good no matter where we are.

18:22.394 --> 18:24.009
Now, Chief, can we get a take, man?

18:24.145 --> 18:25.806
— Yeah.
— Let's get it, baby.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.055
Let's see if y'all can get this right.

18:31.820 --> 18:35.438
I'm telling y'all, I've had it up to my teeth
with all of this bitching and moaning.

18:35.573 --> 18:40.317
Tonight I had to run down to Magazine Street
and rent a hi—hat for Herman last minute.

18:40.453 --> 18:44.537
Come back here to find the horn section —
except for Tim - all had other gigs.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.031
Better—paying gigs, probably.

18:46.167 --> 18:49.534
Hey, man, you supposed to be riding herd
on these motherfuckers.

18:49.671 --> 18:52.788
— Man, I'm making money.
— But it ain't getting no better.

18:52.924 --> 18:56.667
If y'all would just hold the shit down,
we coming into a better class of gigs.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.963
Like what?

18:58.096 --> 19:00.508
Blue Nile had a couple
of holes in their schedge.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.631
— (Wanda) Oh yeah.
— One tomorrow night,

19:02.767 --> 19:04.177
and that's ours if we want it.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.685
Nuh—uh. Think we can fill that, man?

19:07.814 --> 19:11.352
Oh, man, just off the walk-ins
off of Frenchmen Street we can fill that club.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.692
Shit. But not if I can't get you motherfuckers
to show up!

19:14.821 --> 19:16.561
A lot of us got regular gigs.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.689
You don't think l have other responsibilities?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.487
— I got a dayjob in addition to this.
- Really?

19:21.619 --> 19:25.282
Hell yeah. Y'all looking at
the assistant band leader down at Elie.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.121
— (All chatter)
— (Antoine) Not lying.

19:27.250 --> 19:31.414
You know what? Down there I'm respected.
Down there I'm a goddamn professional.

19:31.546 --> 19:34.959
— (Band) Whoa!
— Band leader. He leading a bunch of kids.

19:35.091 --> 19:38.254
- (All laugh)
— Fuck y'all. Fuck all y'all.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.092
— What?!
— I'm not even gonna tell you

19:40.221 --> 19:43.713
how I'm working on getting a late slot
at Jazz Fest. Y'all don't need to hear it.

19:43.850 --> 19:47.809
But Jazz Fest cards been out for
two months now, so who you fooling?

19:47.937 --> 19:49.438
— It's a late fill—in, Wanda.
— Whoa!

19:49.564 --> 19:52.931
See, y'all don't need to know. In fact,
I'm—a put all y'all on a need—to—know basis,

19:53.068 --> 19:55.184
and right now y'all don't need to know...shit.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.901
(Laughter)

19:57.030 --> 19:59.817
Unless I've lost count,
that's more than 18 million passing through me

19:59.949 --> 20:03.407
in real estate purchases, not even counting
the building I've got my money on.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.662
At 2.5 points, that puts me at nearly
half a million on this caper alone.

20:07.791 --> 20:11.375
And I'm well over two million
since I got off the plane down here.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.039
I can't thank you enough.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.036
Just wish I got here sooner.

20:15.173 --> 20:16.959
You've done your part.

20:18.051 --> 20:23.296
Truth is, I've got potential investors lined up
for more property than is actually available.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.298
And I'll confess, Nelson,
mid—city isn't the only area we're looking at.

20:26.434 --> 20:29.392
And yours isn't the only umbrella
I've got people sheltered under.

20:29.521 --> 20:32.228
— I'm not surprised.
— But the window is closing.

20:32.357 --> 20:36.475
There's an announcement coming -
development zones, mid—city planning.

20:37.278 --> 20:41.191
At this point, we shouldn't just be waiting
for auctions and real estate sales.

20:41.324 --> 20:44.737
We should be going door to door,
picking up everything we can.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.202
(Car horn blasts)

20:52.794 --> 20:54.284
(Elevator dings)

20:54.421 --> 20:56.127
You'll be amazed when you see it.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.247
The connections are so obvious.

21:01.136 --> 21:03.092
I know what you're thinking.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.007
— You do?
— Yeah.

21:05.140 --> 21:07.506
"We got museums in New Orleans.
Better museums."

21:07.642 --> 21:10.258
(Sighs) Pay my son no mind.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.636
— He's a little emotional these days.
—(Laughs)

21:12.772 --> 21:14.353
Iworry on him.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.103
Have you ever been to Africa?

21:17.235 --> 21:18.816
Once, but not West Africa.

21:18.945 --> 21:23.029
I've been to South Africa
for a documentary on Mandela

21:23.158 --> 21:25.365
and the Robben Island soccer league.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.404
You should go one day. It's amazing.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.994
I'm not much on travel.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.489
If he ain't been there yet,
it ain't worth the trip, right?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.661
(Albert chuckles)

21:34.794 --> 21:38.412
— Whoa.
— (Dana) That one especially, right?

21:38.548 --> 21:42.666
The Loma of Liberia use such masks
for initiation ceremonies,

21:42.802 --> 21:45.088
and, like you all,
only the initiated members

21:45.221 --> 21:47.803
of the all—male poro society
can carve a mask.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.048
And they say that once
the male puts on the mask,

21:50.185 --> 21:53.177
he's transformed into a spirit.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.144
Looks familiar, right?

21:56.483 --> 21:58.565
Yeah, it's clear to me they got that from us.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.274
Wait. What?

22:00.403 --> 22:03.065
Look at the way they use them feathers
up on that headdress.

22:03.198 --> 22:05.564
That's old—time black Indian right there.

22:06.743 --> 22:10.406
Daddy, we came from Africa,
not the other way around.

22:10.538 --> 22:13.780
- Read the plaque.
— I ain't got to read the goddamn thing.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.828
I got eyes. I can see.

22:17.337 --> 22:21.080
"Such ceremonial garb can be dated
as far back as the late 18th century."

22:21.216 --> 22:22.831
This cat here is wearing these threads

22:22.967 --> 22:25.299
a hundred years before Creole Wild West
or Yellow Pocahontas

22:25.428 --> 22:27.760
had a good dream about Mardi Gras suits.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.345
You see them shells?

22:29.474 --> 22:31.886
You see the way they use them shells?

22:32.018 --> 22:34.054
That's my style.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.723
Daddy, you can't be serious.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.847
Oh, like you say,
I know what I know. (Chuckles)

22:42.278 --> 22:44.189
Oh Lord, take me now.

22:45.448 --> 22:46.949
I appreciate you coming in.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.282
I don't wanna make this any harder for you
than it already is.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.786
But I already did this.

22:50.912 --> 22:54.530
The problem is, Detective Leroy,
while she is a good investigator,

22:54.666 --> 22:56.372
misunderstood a bit of procedure.

22:56.501 --> 22:58.366
She showed you two photo arrays,

22:58.503 --> 23:01.745
each with a possible suspect
and five other fill-in photos.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.872
If you recall, she showed you two arrays,

23:04.008 --> 23:06.750
but the suspects you identified
were both in the same array.

23:09.347 --> 23:12.339
We need to do this properly
so there's no question in court.

23:29.284 --> 23:31.570
OK. Excellent.

23:31.703 --> 23:34.536
— Thank you for that.
— I told you I was positive.

23:34.664 --> 23:39.249
Besides, that other victim is the one
who's pointing them out in court, right?

23:39.377 --> 23:41.493
Ain't that right?

23:41.629 --> 23:44.416
Actually, there have been
some procedural problems

23:44.549 --> 23:47.211
— in that case as well.
— Procedural problems?

23:47.343 --> 23:50.085
In terms of securing a conviction,

23:50.221 --> 23:54.510
we now feel that your case is perhaps
the stronger of the two.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.968
OK, what's going on? You tell me.

23:58.980 --> 24:01.562
The other victim has declined to testify.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.316
What if I decline too?

24:09.449 --> 24:11.485
Without your testimony...

24:12.243 --> 24:14.404
we'll have no case.

24:20.001 --> 24:22.287
(Music playing on radio)

24:22.420 --> 24:25.127
(Cell phone rings)

24:25.256 --> 24:27.998
— Hello. Yeah.
— (Man speaking over phone, indistinct)

24:29.385 --> 24:31.091
Don't play.

24:31.220 --> 24:34.758
A'ight, I'll check it out, but don't be
fucking with me, though. A'ight.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.594
- What?
— Don B say...

24:37.727 --> 24:41.219
— Wild Wayne playing us on the Q right now.
— What?!

24:41.356 --> 24:43.893
— (Laughs) Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?! Right?!

24:44.025 --> 24:47.938
— Yeah! Road Home, huh?
— Yeah. No. No.

24:48.071 --> 24:50.608
— The newjoint.
- Oh!

24:50.740 --> 24:52.776
— (Changes radio station)
- Oh shit!

24:54.410 --> 24:56.321
They playing me on the radio, brah.

24:56.454 --> 24:58.410
— I'm—a tell everybody.
- (Mutters) Yeah.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.325
Hey, that's me on the radio, baby!

25:00.458 --> 25:02.665
— Put it on 093!
— That's great, man.

25:04.128 --> 25:07.120
— (Honks)
— Yo! That's me on the radio!

25:08.174 --> 25:09.539
What!

25:09.676 --> 25:12.793
— Pick up the track!
— (Man) Yo, it's Calliope!

25:14.472 --> 25:16.758
- Somebody scream!
— (Wild Wayne) My man, Lil Calliope.

25:16.891 --> 25:20.349
Always on your hip—hop and R&B station, 093.
Ya heard?

25:20.478 --> 25:24.221
It wasn't mine and the guy...
he told the police it was his.

25:24.357 --> 25:25.517
(Sighs)

25:25.650 --> 25:27.481
I got charged with the marijuana, though.

25:27.610 --> 25:30.101
— That was yours?
— The weed? Sure.

25:31.114 --> 25:32.775
Weed should be legal.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.238
For 16—year—olds?

25:34.367 --> 25:36.323
No, not for 16—year—olds.

25:36.452 --> 25:40.036
(Chuckles) I'm guessing your mother
isn't as nonchalant about this as you are.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.324
No one is.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.322
The lawyer says besides this internship,

25:43.459 --> 25:46.246
I gotta get a paying job before we go to court.

25:47.171 --> 25:50.129
I gotta see a shrink too,
right after I leave here.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.998
The price you pay.

25:52.135 --> 25:54.421
Whatever. I know.

25:54.554 --> 25:58.342
You'll get elected mayor
and then you can make marijuana legal.

25:58.474 --> 26:02.308
Well, not legal, but the kind of thing
that police just write you a ticket for,

26:02.437 --> 26:04.052
like for parking laws.

26:04.188 --> 26:07.680
I can tell you one thing, young lady,
that will not be a campaign promise.

26:08.651 --> 26:10.391
People would vote for you.

26:10.528 --> 26:14.441
I'm guessing we've got bigger problems
to deal with, don't you think?

26:20.621 --> 26:23.203
You'll be a good mayor.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.163
I've seen you second line.

26:25.293 --> 26:26.658
(Both chuckle)

26:28.171 --> 26:29.911
(Man) Smoked lamb,
one octo, two shrimp.

26:30.047 --> 26:32.038
Feels good shucking oysters again.

26:32.175 --> 26:34.291
West Coast oysters,
but oysters just the same.

26:34.427 --> 26:35.963
It's good.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.962
I told you this place is the shit, right?

26:39.098 --> 26:40.929
Cold kimchi consomme on oysters?

26:41.058 --> 26:42.639
(Laughs) I mean, who woulda thought?

26:42.769 --> 26:45.886
This one is for you. This one you'll like.
We just put it on.

26:46.022 --> 26:49.514
Country ham with red—eye mayonnaise.
For a southern girl.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.982
— Where'd that dish come from?
- Southern boy.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.227
Virginia, true son of the South, remember?

26:54.363 --> 26:56.945
(Chang) Bizcocho, come over here.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.781
- Behind you.
— (Man) Six all around.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.777
Dude, we've got a big fucking problem.

27:02.914 --> 27:05.621
Tomorrow we've got to change the menu.
There's been a development.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.661
I heard we're getting sued by
some vegetarian.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.910
She freaked out because her broth
wasn't totally veg.

27:10.046 --> 27:13.709
I told her that we didn't have any strict
vegetarian options except ginger scallion.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.706
Calls the next day, says I lied to her.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.380
She's fucking freaking out.
It's a total pain in my ass.

27:18.513 --> 27:20.845
— So what do you want to do?
— Fuck her, man.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.430
Starting tomorrow,
let's put pork in every fucking dish.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.140
— Sounds good to me.
- All right.

27:25.269 --> 27:28.306
This place is so fucking awesome.

27:30.191 --> 27:31.351
(Band warming up)

27:31.484 --> 27:32.815
(Woman) All right, baby.

27:32.944 --> 27:35.526
(People chattering)

27:35.655 --> 27:37.862
Hey, hey. Come on, baby, look alive.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.367
— Let's do this.
— All right.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.616
Kinda drafty in here, man.

27:42.745 --> 27:44.952
Oh, man, look, short notice for us.

27:45.081 --> 27:47.493
By the second set,
we'll have a whole bunch of walk—ins.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.161
I don't know about that, boss.

27:49.293 --> 27:53.002
We've got Kermit and his guys
a couple of doors down at Ray's.

27:56.759 --> 27:59.501
(Chuckles) Give me ten. I'll be back.

27:59.637 --> 28:01.218
— All right.
— Ten.

28:02.682 --> 28:06.425
— (J‘ Jazz)
— (Kermit) New Orleans is file gumbo.

28:06.561 --> 28:10.145
New Orleans is grits
with easy-over egg

28:10.273 --> 28:12.764
with brown gravy and liver
smothered with onions

28:12.900 --> 28:15.767
with toast bread on a Sunday morning.

28:17.363 --> 28:21.231
New Orleans is "Tu way pocky way."

28:21.367 --> 28:23.949
New Orleans is...
J‘ Cotton Eye Joe early in the morning...

28:24.078 --> 28:27.161
— How you been, buddy?
— J‘ Hu—na—nay, hopping and hollerin' J‘

28:27.290 --> 28:31.078
New Orleans is yours truly,
Kermit Ruffins and the Barbecue Swingers,

28:31.210 --> 28:33.792
live at Ray Ray's Boom Boom Room.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.912
— New Orleans is...
- (Cheering)

28:41.554 --> 28:44.216
— (Gunfire on TV)
— Yeah, I've gotta get my sons out of here,

28:44.348 --> 28:48.261
— drop them at a movie or... or something.
— (Man on TV) Bravo 1, contact intercepted.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.602
Right, so I have a couple of hours to kill
and I was, um...

28:51.731 --> 28:55.474
— (Man on TV) Reload.
— Well, Iwasjust wondering if, uh...

28:55.610 --> 28:57.441
if you wanted to meet me for a beer...

28:57.570 --> 28:59.231
or something.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.321
— I could use one.
— (Man on TV) Get into position, team.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.941
Great. Uh...

29:05.077 --> 29:07.068
The columns on St Charles?

29:07.204 --> 29:08.614
(Man on TV) 3:00!

29:08.748 --> 29:11.785
— (Gunfire on TV continues)
— Right. I'll see you then.

29:16.797 --> 29:19.288
Turn this shit off! We're going out.

29:41.030 --> 29:43.316
(Cheering)

29:55.962 --> 29:57.998
(Man) We killed it, right? We killed it, huh?

29:58.130 --> 30:01.088
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no shit.
— (Kermit) Yeah, yeah, yeah!

30:01.217 --> 30:04.880
All right, music lovers,
we're gonna take a slight pause

30:05.012 --> 30:07.970
for a worthy cause and we'll be right...

30:08.599 --> 30:11.056
- Hey!
— Antoine Batiste!

30:11.185 --> 30:12.766
(Cheering)

30:13.813 --> 30:16.555
(Kermit) Man, my bad.
I didn't see you standing over there.

30:16.691 --> 30:18.431
Come on down and play a number, man.

30:20.319 --> 30:24.403
Right about now we're gonna get Antoine to
come up here and do a number with us, y'all.

30:24.532 --> 30:27.899
— What you got, Batiste?
— Can y'all follow me on some Al Green?

30:28.035 --> 30:29.411
You fucking with the Reverend?

30:29.537 --> 30:31.198
- Yeah, baby.
— Oh, man. Come on, man.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.241
— Let's Stay Together.
- (Cheering)

30:56.439 --> 30:59.226
J‘ |...

30:59.358 --> 31:02.350
J‘ Am so in love with you

31:03.571 --> 31:06.404
J‘ Whatever you wanna do

31:07.825 --> 31:12.694
J‘ Is all right with me, hey... J‘

31:37.688 --> 31:43.854
J‘ Let's stay together J‘

31:43.986 --> 31:45.567
(Cheering)

31:46.739 --> 31:48.604
Yeah! All right.

31:48.741 --> 31:52.325
Mr. Antoine Batiste on the vocals, baby.

31:52.453 --> 31:55.035
That's going especially out
to the ladies, you know. Yeah.

31:55.164 --> 31:56.700
(Cheering)

31:56.832 --> 31:59.539
You see, I can't help it.
I'm just a gangsta of love, baby.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.535
(Laughs) And if y'all need to hear
more about my crimes,

32:02.671 --> 32:07.131
y'all can just pick up your drinks and come on
down the block to the Blue Nile right now

32:07.259 --> 32:09.636
and hear the Soul Apostles.

32:09.762 --> 32:13.550
This is New Orleans. All you gotta do is put it
in the go-cup and come down the banquette.

32:13.682 --> 32:14.842
Ain't got no cover charge.

32:14.975 --> 32:18.058
— We doing that good old—fashioned...
- (Cheering)

32:18.187 --> 32:21.224
..mmm, good grinding, roaring beat.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.348
Kermit gonna take a break.
Come on, let's go!

32:23.484 --> 32:26.442
- (Cheering)
— You think I'm playing?

32:26.570 --> 32:29.027
Come away on that, Batiste!

32:29.156 --> 32:31.943
Antoine! Motherfucker.

32:32.076 --> 32:33.816
(Cheering continues)

32:45.923 --> 32:47.914
— They on my list.
- All of them?

32:48.759 --> 32:50.499
— Mr. Batiste.
- Oh!

32:51.262 --> 32:54.675
— Wanna hear you play some.
— Hey, brah, let him in.

32:54.807 --> 32:56.718
Underage, man. That's a kid.

32:56.851 --> 33:00.218
Man, this my son. Right there.

33:01.188 --> 33:04.146
Damn, Antoine.
How many goddamn kids you got?

33:04.275 --> 33:05.731
— (Both laugh)
— Shit.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.600
All right. Come on now, hit it!

33:07.736 --> 33:10.148
Hit it and don't quit it!
Soul Apostles in the house!

33:10.281 --> 33:12.863
Come on! Come on, come on.

33:14.118 --> 33:17.861
Ah! Oh, here you go now.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.285
Where y'all at?

33:22.418 --> 33:23.407
J‘ Hoo! J‘

33:23.544 --> 33:24.704
Come on.

33:24.837 --> 33:25.997
J‘ Mr. Big Stuff J‘

33:26.130 --> 33:27.916
Ha!

33:28.048 --> 33:29.754
J‘ Who do you think you are?

33:29.884 --> 33:31.124
J‘ Mr. Big Stuff... J‘

33:31.260 --> 33:32.966
Come on, y'all, let's roll it.

33:33.095 --> 33:35.711
J‘ You're never gonna get my love

33:35.848 --> 33:38.180
J‘ Now because you wear

33:38.309 --> 33:40.891
J‘ All those fancy clothes

33:41.020 --> 33:43.306
J‘ You drive a big, fine car

33:43.439 --> 33:45.930
J‘ Oh yes, you do

33:46.066 --> 33:48.398
J‘ Do you think I can't afford

33:48.527 --> 33:51.519
J‘ To give you my love?

33:51.655 --> 33:55.898
J‘ You think you're higher
than every star above

33:56.035 --> 33:57.616
J‘ Well, Mr. Big Stuff

33:57.745 --> 33:59.326
J‘ Tell me, come on

33:59.455 --> 34:01.446
J‘ Who do you think you are?

34:01.582 --> 34:03.322
J‘ Mr. Big Stuff

34:04.585 --> 34:07.292
J‘ You're never gonna get my love... J‘

34:07.421 --> 34:08.752
(J‘ Slowjazz)

34:12.301 --> 34:15.714
J‘ My heart beats

34:15.846 --> 34:18.804
J‘ Just like a hammer

34:19.433 --> 34:23.051
J‘ My arms were wound

34:23.187 --> 34:27.055
J‘ Around you so tight

34:27.191 --> 34:32.276
J‘ And stars, they fell on

34:32.404 --> 34:38.900
J‘ Alabama last night J‘

34:40.079 --> 34:42.070
Good pick on the bar.

34:43.040 --> 34:46.532
I doubt that we'll run into anybody
that I work with...

34:47.127 --> 34:48.742
or for.

34:48.879 --> 34:51.461
Would that be a problem?

34:52.800 --> 34:56.713
Well, in my world,
you are a bit of a pariah.

34:56.845 --> 34:58.585
(Laughs)

35:00.391 --> 35:03.053
Yeah, and there's been
station house talk.

35:04.478 --> 35:06.184
About?

35:07.398 --> 35:08.888
That we're friendly.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.606
You've been catching hell, huh?

35:14.405 --> 35:16.191
Uh...

35:17.616 --> 35:22.326
I went outside the chain of command
after the Helen Hill thing

35:22.454 --> 35:27.039
and I told the deputy chief
that Homicide was screwing the case.

35:28.585 --> 35:30.450
You know what happens next?

35:31.630 --> 35:33.336
I am transferred to Homicide.

35:34.091 --> 35:36.707
Yeah, they give me a shift...

35:36.844 --> 35:40.428
and they drop me right under the captain
that I pissed off.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.968
Why would they do that?

35:43.100 --> 35:44.681
Think it through.

35:46.520 --> 35:50.604
Either I get the goods on Guidry
and I help them get rid of him or...

35:52.318 --> 35:53.728
Guidry finds a way to do you.

35:53.861 --> 35:56.352
- Yeah.
— (Tuts)

35:56.488 --> 35:59.480
And either way, the bosses figure
that the problem takes care of itself.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.447
Oh Jesus, Terry.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.735
So much for reform, huh?

36:04.872 --> 36:06.157
(She chuckles)

36:06.290 --> 36:10.078
Is it any wonder that no one in this town
ever gets up on their hind legs?

36:10.210 --> 36:14.453
J‘ In my imagination

36:14.590 --> 36:16.421
J‘ A situation... J‘

36:17.468 --> 36:20.505
J‘ Yeah yeah yeah

36:20.637 --> 36:22.764
J‘ Mr. Big Stuff

36:23.766 --> 36:25.722
J‘ Who do you think you are?

36:25.851 --> 36:28.888
J‘ Mr. Big Stuff, tell me

36:29.021 --> 36:32.138
J‘ You're never gonna get my love, oh! J‘

36:41.533 --> 36:43.489
— (Music stops)
— (Mouths)

36:43.619 --> 36:45.530
(Cheering)

36:52.753 --> 36:55.165
— This was nice.
- It was.

36:56.757 --> 36:58.167
(Toni clears throat)

36:59.635 --> 37:00.624
Toni.

37:02.805 --> 37:04.796
I don't know.

37:04.932 --> 37:06.047
If...

37:07.976 --> 37:09.682
I don't think I'm ready.

37:10.813 --> 37:13.475
- OK.
— Sofia, me...

37:14.566 --> 37:16.727
Still pretty raw.

37:16.860 --> 37:19.021
Right. I get it.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.445
But thank you.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.243
(Cheering)

37:33.961 --> 37:35.121
(Applause)

37:35.254 --> 37:37.461
(Whistles, cheering)

37:43.887 --> 37:45.878
(Cheering)

37:54.940 --> 37:57.477
Yo, I'm Kermit Ruffins
and the Barbecue Swingers.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.065
We gonna start our next set

37:59.194 --> 38:01.571
soon as I get back down there
by the Boom Boom Room.

38:01.697 --> 38:02.982
— Y'all ready?
- (Cheering)

38:03.115 --> 38:05.572
— Y'all still got the go—cups?
— (Cheering)

38:05.701 --> 38:07.191
Follow me.

38:08.245 --> 38:10.110
You sure make me smile.

38:10.247 --> 38:12.283
(Man) Wild, man! Let's do it, baby!

38:12.416 --> 38:13.747
(Chattering)

38:21.550 --> 38:23.836
That's one hell of a plan, dude.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.629
(Wanda) There you have it.

38:28.765 --> 38:31.472
Took in four and a half feet of water.

38:31.602 --> 38:34.435
At first I was waiting on the insurance.

38:34.563 --> 38:37.726
That came in, but it wasn't
what it was supposed to be.

38:38.567 --> 38:41.104
And I waited for the government money.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.613
Meantime, my wife passed.

38:43.739 --> 38:47.072
- (Arnie) Sorry to hear.
— Any of that federal money come through?

38:49.286 --> 38:51.447
— Does it look like it did?
- Huh.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.070
Well, as I said,

38:53.207 --> 38:56.415
I'll be happy to look at the assessed
value of the property and then better it.

38:56.543 --> 39:00.582
State sent some paper with the value
of the house and the damage done.

39:00.714 --> 39:02.670
Don't recall where I put it.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.637
If I don't hear from you soon,
I'll stop back around.

39:11.558 --> 39:15.392
It's a really catchy dance song.

39:15.521 --> 39:17.136
(Laughs)

39:18.607 --> 39:20.222
Where were you when it came on?

39:20.359 --> 39:23.692
- In my car.
— Wild Wayne played it?

39:24.404 --> 39:27.646
Yeah, twice in an hour.

39:30.285 --> 39:33.243
Well, Calliope had to be thrilled.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.954
Huh. Yeah.

39:37.125 --> 39:40.583
You know, the exposure's gonna be good
for you and your band.

39:41.838 --> 39:45.001
— The True wasn't mine.
- But still...

39:51.848 --> 39:53.839
I'm happy for him.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.555
(Both laughing)

39:57.688 --> 40:00.896
I am. I'm... I'm happy.

40:02.943 --> 40:04.934
(On radio: J‘ Hip—hop)

40:11.952 --> 40:13.943
(Music stops)

40:22.421 --> 40:24.412
Ready to open?

40:26.466 --> 40:28.206
Miss LaDee?

40:31.305 --> 40:32.920
I gotta go.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.842
Sorry.

40:46.403 --> 40:48.689
(Hidalgo) You'll like this offer.
(Man) Not interested.

40:48.822 --> 40:51.188
You and your wife are gonna be very happy
with this offer.

40:51.325 --> 40:54.158
— We're paying top dollar.
— Not interested.

40:54.286 --> 40:56.402
— Hear me out, sir.
— I'm not selling.

40:56.538 --> 40:59.701
Not ever.
Not after what I've been through.

40:59.833 --> 41:03.417
When I leave here, it'll be feet first.

41:06.214 --> 41:10.457
(Albert) I wanna talk to you about our drummer.
(Delmond) You don't think Carl Allen's subtle?

41:10.594 --> 41:12.425
— Really?
— Too damn subtle.

41:12.554 --> 41:16.046
I hired him and Ron Carter
'cause I figured you'd like 'em —

41:16.183 --> 41:18.674
two classic jazz men
right up your alley.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.311
Not for what I'm trying to do.

41:20.437 --> 41:24.350
I need somebody like
Earl Palmer or Herman Ernest.

41:24.483 --> 41:26.314
For what you trying to do?

41:26.443 --> 41:28.434
Shit, for my part, yeah.

41:28.570 --> 41:32.062
We could get somebody
like Uganda Roberts

41:32.199 --> 41:35.111
to come up here and work
as your percussion man.

41:35.243 --> 41:38.986
Carl ain't gonna mind another percussionist
working with us. We could bring somebody up.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.408
No, no, we gotta take this whole thing
down to New Orleans.

41:41.541 --> 41:44.829
— The entire session?
- It don't feel right.

41:44.961 --> 41:47.452
— I can't do it here.
—(Laughs)

41:49.675 --> 41:52.257
— What?
— Listen to you, Daddy.

41:52.386 --> 41:54.468
Can't nobody play the drums, play a bass line,

41:54.596 --> 41:56.382
cook a steak or fry a fish up here.

41:56.515 --> 41:59.757
In all of New York, New York,
can't nobody do nothing to suit you.

41:59.893 --> 42:01.679
Look, I know what's right and what ain't.

42:01.812 --> 42:05.054
- No, you know what you know.
— Yeah, well, if I don't know it by now,

42:05.190 --> 42:06.305
fuckit

42:06.441 --> 42:08.853
Always the last damn word.
Always the last fucking word.

42:08.985 --> 42:12.068
Always need it, always want it,
always gonna have to have it, huh, Daddy?

42:13.240 --> 42:15.105
(Truck horn blasts)

42:15.242 --> 42:16.778
Nope.

42:16.910 --> 42:18.571
(Car honks)

42:18.704 --> 42:21.616
— (Foghorn)
— (King) Your brother named one of the officers.

42:21.748 --> 42:25.081
We have that name. We're just asking you
to confirm that it's the right name.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.791
George told you a name, it's on him.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.252
I don't want police knowing we spoke.

42:29.381 --> 42:32.088
— You have our word.
— Police not gonna do shit anyhow.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.627
They won't, people don't step up.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.968
— Can't argue with that.
— Please, Miss Beaulieu.

42:37.097 --> 42:40.635
I can't help you all.
I gotta live here, you know.

42:45.188 --> 42:48.351
- (Don) Huh.
— (Cornell grunts)

42:50.569 --> 42:53.606
— Damn, dog, you really driving.
— (Don laughs)

42:55.741 --> 42:58.949
— Use an 8 on that, son.
- Yeah, I know it.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.362
Don't look like you do.

43:00.495 --> 43:03.908
So now you gonna teach me
about nautical knots, right?

43:04.040 --> 43:05.541
(Both grunting)

43:05.667 --> 43:07.703
You two through playing grab—ass?

43:07.836 --> 43:11.169
—(Laughs)
— (Cornell) See ya, Don.

43:11.298 --> 43:15.632
Since we're running up to the city for the gig,
let's stop at Chalmette for some seafood.

43:15.761 --> 43:18.878
Chalmette? Why Chalmette?

43:19.014 --> 43:22.381
(Laughs) It's a market, not a restaurant, dude.

43:22.517 --> 43:25.509
They got some sit—downs over there
off Paris Road.

43:25.645 --> 43:28.512
Yeah, I know why you wanna drag
my ass up there, man.

43:28.648 --> 43:30.263
Come on, the meal's on me,

43:30.400 --> 43:32.857
or it will be as soon as
you peel off some more bills

43:32.986 --> 43:35.398
— from my money roll, man.
- (Laughs)

43:35.530 --> 43:37.816
Hopeless, man. Shit.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.735
— (J‘ Hip—hop)
— (Bells jingle)

43:39.868 --> 43:42.905
- What's down?
— Yo, man, Flukejust got out of the hospital.

43:43.038 --> 43:44.903
He over there on St Anthony, I'm saying.

43:45.040 --> 43:48.624
(Toni) Excuse me, sir. Good afternoon.
(Man) That's you, dawg.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.745
Lady lawyer, eh?

43:53.882 --> 43:55.998
I see you brought
the cavalry with you today.

43:56.134 --> 43:58.045
You plainclothes or Homicide?

43:58.178 --> 44:00.294
- Neither.
— Oh, a bodyguard.

44:00.430 --> 44:03.263
— Yeah, you smart to bring protection, lady.
- I'm Toni Bernette.

44:03.391 --> 44:06.599
I don't work for or with the police.
You remember.

44:06.728 --> 44:10.596
(Exhales sharply) I remember. And I remember
telling you I don't remember anything else

44:10.732 --> 44:13.724
— about what happened at that damn store.
— Billy Wilson.

44:13.860 --> 44:17.102
That's the name of the cop
that showed up at Robideaux's.

44:17.239 --> 44:20.026
He's one of them
who did the dirt there, right?

44:20.742 --> 44:23.575
We got the name from someone
who saw Officer Wilson

44:23.703 --> 44:26.115
chase a man into a unit at the Iberville,

44:26.248 --> 44:27.909
likely the same afternoon.

44:28.041 --> 44:30.248
Also shot dead, same caliber weapon.

44:31.419 --> 44:34.206
We've got two people dead behind this
and no one wants to talk.

44:34.339 --> 44:36.421
Yeah, well, people dying
all the time round here.

44:36.550 --> 44:39.792
— That's just how it go.
— If you intimidated, I can understand that.

44:41.638 --> 44:44.004
That's what they count on —
folks staying frightened.

44:44.140 --> 44:45.880
— Motherfucker, I ain't afraid.
- I'm just saying.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.724
- I ain't fucking afraid of no one.
— Nobody's afraid, but no one says a word.

44:48.854 --> 44:50.685
You think I wasn't willing to give my name?

44:50.814 --> 44:55.103
You think I'm just gonna let someone
shoot people down and not say something?

44:55.235 --> 44:57.521
Yeah, that's right.

44:57.654 --> 44:59.485
I already fucking gave my name.

44:59.614 --> 45:03.527
— What?
— I called the police. I gave my name.

45:03.660 --> 45:06.367
— Who did you talk to?
— Man, I called 911.

45:06.496 --> 45:09.909
I told her I saw the police shoot a boy down
for no damn reason.

45:10.041 --> 45:12.874
I gave 'em my name.
I gave 'em my cell phone number too.

45:13.003 --> 45:14.743
And what happened next?

45:14.880 --> 45:18.043
About two weeks later,
this detective calls me,

45:18.174 --> 45:20.256
arranges to come past
by my mother's house.

45:20.385 --> 45:23.422
He said, "If you wanna come forward
and tell 'em what you saw, it's no problem.

45:23.555 --> 45:26.092
"We'll take you right downtown,
let you make a statement.

45:26.224 --> 45:28.089
"When they pump the water
out of the courthouse,

45:28.226 --> 45:30.638
— "we'll take you over there, say the same."
— And did you?

45:30.770 --> 45:34.012
No, 'cause the next thing
this cop tells me

45:34.149 --> 45:36.310
is that before
I can make my statement

45:36.443 --> 45:39.276
he needs my name,
my date of birth,

45:39.404 --> 45:41.941
my mother's name,
her date of birth.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.155
Do the same
for everybody living in her house,

45:44.284 --> 45:47.026
for all your kinfolk
and for everybody who we hang with.

45:47.162 --> 45:51.201
He said if he find any paper
on any one of my people

45:51.333 --> 45:54.575
or anybody who got anything to do with me,
they all going to jail.

45:54.711 --> 45:56.326
He threatened you that way?

45:56.463 --> 46:00.456
So now you see why I managed
not to remember a damn thing.

46:01.384 --> 46:05.377
But yeah, Wilson was there.
He always been an asshole.

46:05.513 --> 46:09.347
And another one I remember, too, from
around the way — white cop named Harvin.

46:11.019 --> 46:12.884
I gave him that name too.

46:13.021 --> 46:15.979
— Sorry for doubting you there, bro.
— Yeah, I bet.

46:16.107 --> 46:19.099
The detective — his name?
You remember?

46:20.111 --> 46:21.487
French, I think.

46:21.613 --> 46:23.569
Prioleau?

46:24.366 --> 46:25.822
Prioleau.

46:32.165 --> 46:33.905
I'll come back on the weekend.

46:34.042 --> 46:35.623
You know, I replaced that one.

46:35.752 --> 46:37.663
The roof? Nice job.

46:37.796 --> 46:40.959
Damn straight. It should last 10, 15 years.

46:51.059 --> 46:54.893
If Homicide came out on this, then there
should be a record of the 911 call in the file.

46:55.021 --> 46:56.602
Yeah, there should be.

46:56.731 --> 46:59.268
There should also be
a first officer's report,

46:59.401 --> 47:03.440
and bullet casings that were recovered
and God knows what else.

47:03.571 --> 47:06.608
Either it's stuck in a drawer or in some file
somewhere in Homicide.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.481
Yeah, or just gone,

47:08.618 --> 47:11.781
disappeared like everything else.

47:13.373 --> 47:16.706
But you're right — it all goes back
to the homicide unit.

47:16.835 --> 47:19.952
— That's where the dirt is on this.
- You know anyone up there?

47:22.549 --> 47:23.959
(Knocks on door)

47:26.344 --> 47:28.255
— You wanted to see me?
- (Oliver) come in.

47:28.388 --> 47:30.003
Close the door for me.

47:34.019 --> 47:35.634
Sit down.

47:41.401 --> 47:45.235
Yesterday I let you talk and I didn't say
too much about what you told me,

47:45.363 --> 47:48.196
so now I'm gonna talk.

47:49.659 --> 47:52.526
OK, then, your people didn't raise you
to get in a car with kids

47:52.662 --> 47:54.698
you knew were the no—account kind.

47:54.831 --> 47:57.322
But, young lady,
your mother has it hard right now.

47:57.459 --> 48:00.075
Your dad's gone
and what she's got left is you.

48:00.211 --> 48:03.544
— My father fucking killed himself. If he...
- I can't speak to what your father

48:03.673 --> 48:07.757
was feeling, but maybe he was hurting
like a lot of people around here are hurting.

48:07.886 --> 48:10.878
But what you have to ask is,
are you gonna add to that hurt?

48:11.014 --> 48:12.675
Is that who you are?

48:17.145 --> 48:19.136
(Gulls crying)

48:23.443 --> 48:26.435
Yo, Sonny, fire me up.

48:30.241 --> 48:32.573
(Chuckles) Draggin' my ass up here.

48:33.703 --> 48:35.204
You don't got a prayer, son.

48:35.330 --> 48:38.743
Vietnamese around here stick to themselves,
and you ain't in that club.

48:38.875 --> 48:41.912
(Sonny) Her father? Looks kinda hard.

48:42.045 --> 48:45.629
I seen him around — shrimper who has a boat
here in Chalmette.

48:45.757 --> 48:48.043
Works both seasons, brown and white.

48:48.176 --> 48:51.339
— Does some crabbing too.
— (Bell clanging)

48:56.017 --> 48:57.803
(Cornell) Shit, let's get a beer.

48:57.936 --> 49:01.724
You can rap with your girl after you swallow
some liquid courage.

49:01.856 --> 49:05.189
— (Engine starts)
— (Cornell) Hey, come on, man.

49:09.864 --> 49:11.365
(Cheering)

49:13.159 --> 49:15.901
Thank you! Thank you very much.

49:16.037 --> 49:18.028
And the more observant
among you may note

49:18.164 --> 49:21.782
that I have with me any number of cabbages
thrown at me during the recent festivities.

49:21.918 --> 49:26.161
Along with a couple of carrots
and a spud or two. He caught half a stew.

49:26.297 --> 49:29.539
Indeed, yes, so any of you
wishing to tip a dollar or more,

49:29.676 --> 49:32.008
please feel free to avail yourself.
Go on, take one.

49:32.137 --> 49:35.095
— They're beautiful Louisiana cabbage.
- (Cheering)

49:36.516 --> 49:38.848
So Hank in E-flat,
'cause that's where it's at.

49:38.977 --> 49:40.763
—(Laughs)
— A—one, a—two,

49:40.895 --> 49:43.432
a—one, two, three, four.

49:46.901 --> 49:51.190
J‘ You're looking at a man
that's getting mighty mad

49:51.322 --> 49:54.814
J‘ Had a lot of luck,
but it's all been bad

49:54.951 --> 49:58.068
J‘ No matter how I struggle and strive

49:58.204 --> 50:03.289
J‘ I'll never get out of this world alive J‘

50:07.172 --> 50:08.708
— Red alert.
— What?

50:08.840 --> 50:12.173
— You don't recognize him?
- Oh yeah, he's a chef.

50:12.302 --> 50:14.884
He's one of those new
bistronomy guys from France.

50:15.013 --> 50:16.503
Better go tell David.

50:22.020 --> 50:23.931
Behind.

50:24.063 --> 50:27.055
— Can you get me the shallow plate, please?
- (Bizcocho) Yes, chef.

50:28.443 --> 50:32.436
Can you hand me the caviar
and the fines herbes?

50:54.802 --> 50:56.212
Behind, behind.

50:57.847 --> 50:59.553
Enjoy, chef.

51:03.811 --> 51:06.553
— Holy fucking fuck.
— The man likes his eggs.

51:08.233 --> 51:09.973
(Sniffs)

51:10.610 --> 51:12.100
Oh fuck.

51:13.363 --> 51:14.603
— See ya.
— Let's do this.

51:14.739 --> 51:16.070
Check, check, check, hello.

51:16.199 --> 51:18.110
— Our fearless leader.
- Hi, gentlemen.

51:18.243 --> 51:20.154
— (Man) Hey!
— Road Home,

51:20.286 --> 51:23.699
then Not A Word,
then Nagin's Lament.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.537
(Cheering)

51:26.584 --> 51:29.917
What's good, y'all?
What's good, Don B?

51:30.046 --> 51:33.459
— (Crowd chanting) The True, The True!
- Wanna hear The True? Go on with it.

51:33.591 --> 51:36.628
(Chanting) The True, The True,
The True, The True!

51:36.761 --> 51:40.299
— Wanna hear The True?
— (Cheering)

51:40.431 --> 51:43.639
Yeah, y'all wanna hear The True.

51:43.768 --> 51:47.181
— Gotta give the people what they want.
- Play the fucking song later.

51:47.313 --> 51:49.645
— Dude, what the fuck, man?
- (Calliope vocalizes)

51:49.774 --> 51:52.140
J‘ I'm the true, I'm the true
J‘ I'm the true, I'm the true

51:52.318 --> 51:54.479
J‘ I'm the true, I'm the true
J‘ I'm the true, I'm the true

51:54.612 --> 51:56.944
J‘ I'm the true, I'm the true
J‘ I'm the true, I'm the true

51:57.073 --> 51:58.938
J‘ I'm the true, I'm the true

51:59.075 --> 52:01.987
J‘ Throw your hands in the sky

52:02.120 --> 52:04.406
J‘ Ain't nobody doing it like you do

52:04.539 --> 52:06.325
J‘ Keep moving what your mama gave you

52:06.457 --> 52:09.290
J‘ Couldn't nobody do it like you do

52:09.419 --> 52:11.785
J‘ Throw your hands in the sky

52:11.921 --> 52:14.162
J‘ Ain't nobody doing it like you

52:14.299 --> 52:16.381
J‘ Until my fellas
keep on making that money

52:16.509 --> 52:19.000
J‘ 'Cause nobody hustle like you J‘

52:19.137 --> 52:21.128
We have 73 redevelopment teams

52:21.264 --> 52:24.927
to start in every distinct neighborhood
across this city.

52:25.059 --> 52:29.769
(Man) Now, the city is focusing on
redeveloping 17 targeted areas around the city.

52:29.897 --> 52:32.274
We think that by doing
the targeted zones,

52:32.400 --> 52:34.812
it's gonna spur investments
and continue...

52:34.944 --> 52:38.277
Recovery zones, huh?
If I had any extra cash on hand,

52:38.406 --> 52:41.273
I'd be buying up property
in those neighborhoods.

52:43.661 --> 52:45.652
You'd be late on that one, son.

52:56.799 --> 52:59.791
J‘ Yeah, when I woke up,
I was all alone

53:02.221 --> 53:05.054
J‘ With a broken heart
and a ticket home

53:07.143 --> 53:09.805
J‘ And I ask you now

53:09.937 --> 53:12.974
J‘ Tell me, what would you do?

53:13.107 --> 53:16.565
J‘ If her hair was black
and her eyes were blue?

53:16.694 --> 53:19.902
J‘ Said I've traveled around

53:20.031 --> 53:22.989
J‘ I've been all over this world

53:23.117 --> 53:25.108
J‘ Boys, I ain't never seen nothing

53:25.244 --> 53:29.362
J‘ Like a Galway girl, ho! J‘

53:32.835 --> 53:34.166
Thanks, darling.

53:40.218 --> 53:41.958
(Cheering)

53:42.095 --> 53:45.132
(Harley) Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

53:45.264 --> 53:48.973
We will see you on another street corner,
probably right over there, tomorrow night.

53:49.102 --> 53:52.139
— Thank you very much and good night.
- Do you guys fancy going for a beer?

53:52.271 --> 53:54.182
I told Davis I'd catch his late set.

53:54.315 --> 53:55.976
Cool, cool. Harley?

53:56.109 --> 53:59.226
— I'm gonna walk her back up to St Claude.
- Yeah.

53:59.362 --> 54:01.478
- (Harley) Take that.
— I'll see you back at the flat.

54:01.614 --> 54:03.775
- Yeah, right.
— (Jim) Been a pleasure.

54:04.659 --> 54:07.071
— Fancy a pint?
— Sure.

54:07.203 --> 54:08.568
(Jim) Come on.

54:08.704 --> 54:10.786
(Laughs)

54:23.094 --> 54:25.551
J‘ Hu-ta-nay
J‘ Hu—ta—nay now

54:25.680 --> 54:27.841
J‘ Hu-ta-nay
J‘ Hu—ta—nay now

54:27.974 --> 54:30.340
J‘ Hu-ta-nay
J‘ Hu—ta—nay now

54:30.476 --> 54:33.013
J‘ Hu—ta—nay
J‘ Hu—ta—nay now J‘

54:53.583 --> 54:55.539
(Music stops)

55:01.924 --> 55:04.301
That might be the winner right there.

55:04.427 --> 55:07.339
That feel like a take
to you or what, Big Chief?

55:09.974 --> 55:12.386
Yeah, if that's what y'all want.

55:18.065 --> 55:20.272
(Whistles)

55:20.860 --> 55:21.895
(Door closes)

55:26.741 --> 55:28.606
So we settled, then?

55:40.713 --> 55:42.795
I'll call the realtor tomorrow,

55:42.924 --> 55:45.040
get it on the market
by the end of the week.

55:53.100 --> 55:55.967
Yeah, I don't know, man.
It's like, the pennywhistle...

55:56.729 --> 56:00.938
— it's a real instrument, believe it or not.
— (Laughs) It's a real instrument.

56:01.067 --> 56:02.853
No, people... People actually...

56:02.985 --> 56:05.192
It's definitely a real instrument in his hands.

56:05.321 --> 56:06.777
They still make fun of him, though.

56:06.906 --> 56:08.988
— It's just like...
— Drop that shit in your hands.

56:09.116 --> 56:11.243
Y'all know what it is! Come on.

56:11.369 --> 56:13.280
- (Man) Give it up.
— All right, all right.

56:13.412 --> 56:16.199
— Give it up.
— All right. OK. Go on, take it.

56:16.332 --> 56:18.618
Goddamn right I'm gonna take it.

56:18.751 --> 56:22.118
— You're making a bad choice, son.
- (Man 2) What?

56:29.095 --> 56:31.211
I ain't your motherfucking son.

56:31.347 --> 56:32.257
(Annie whimpers)

56:32.390 --> 56:35.052
— (Body thuds)
— (Dogs barking)

56:43.442 --> 56:46.525
Help! Help!

56:51.742 --> 56:53.733
— (Tires screech)
— Hey, man!

56:55.288 --> 56:57.779
— Damn!
— J‘ Come back to me

56:57.915 --> 57:00.452
— J‘ I'm walking, yes indeed J‘
- (Girl shrieks)

57:00.585 --> 57:03.076
J‘ And I'm talking about you and me

57:03.212 --> 57:04.827
J‘ And I'm hoping that you... J‘

57:04.964 --> 57:06.704
That's straight New Orleans right there.

57:06.841 --> 57:10.254
- (Sirens blaring)
— (Singing continues)

57:14.640 --> 57:16.221
That's New Orleans too.

57:19.270 --> 57:21.056
(Mutters) Yeah.

57:23.691 --> 57:25.022
Taxi!

57:25.151 --> 57:27.642
J‘ Hey, that you'll come back to me... J‘

57:27.778 --> 57:30.269
Come on, brah.
