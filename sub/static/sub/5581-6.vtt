00:35.320 --> 00:37.470
Oh, let me give you one of those.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.390
Can I give you one of those?
It's an open day at the Abbey.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.110
Please come along, in aid
of the hospital trust.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.470
- Hello, sir, might I offer you one of those?
- Thank you very much.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.720
Please bring the family.
Would you like one of those?

00:55.720 --> 00:58.510
But what are they paying to
see? We have nothing to show 'em.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.760
A decent Reynolds, a couple
of Romneys and a Winterhalter.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.710
That's your lot. They'd do better

01:03.760 --> 01:06.800
- visiting the Tate.
- That's not the point.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.870
People want to see a different sort
of home. It's not the things in it.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.750
- How the other half lives?
- If you like. There's curiosity.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.230
- Dr Clarkson, what do you feel?
- Keeping people healthy takes a lot

01:17.280 --> 01:20.600
of money in this day and age. We
could raise more than you think.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.150
Robert, we are opening
for one day for charity,

01:23.200 --> 01:26.430
and there's an end to it. Mary
and Tom have made the decision.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.190
Ah. I know well enough
that when Mary has spoken,

01:29.240 --> 01:31.310
my opinion has little
bearing on the matter.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.350
You don't really mind, do you?

01:33.400 --> 01:35.760
No, but I think it's crackers.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.950
I don't like it. Poking and
prying around the house.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.390
What's to stop them slipping the odd
first edition into their back pockets?

01:43.440 --> 01:45.750
You've a very poor opinion
of your fellow man.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.030
I have the opinion that
life has taught me.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.240
But I don't see why anyone would
pay good money to come and look.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.590
- You're not curious about how
other people live. - No. I'm not.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.480
And if you'd the chance to see the private
rooms of the King and Queen, would you pay?

01:58.560 --> 02:02.320
But what would it tell me? They sleep
in a bed, they eat at a table. So do I.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.000
I always wonder whether someone else
is having a better time than I am.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.800
But that's what's so dangerous. You
think they must be having a better time.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.950
Then you want them not
to have a better time.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.230
- The next thing you know, there's a guillotine
in Trafalgar Square. - Ever the optimist (!)

02:16.280 --> 02:18.950
I think all these houses
should be open to the public.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.550
What gives them the
right to keep people out?

02:20.600 --> 02:22.790
The law of property,
which is the cornerstone

02:22.840 --> 02:25.190
of any civilisation worthy of the name.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.350
Well, to me, it could be a good thing.

02:27.400 --> 02:31.400
To let them enjoy fine craftsmanship
and beautiful paintings.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.950
But then, of course, they're
bound to start asking,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.190
"Why have the Crawleys got
all of this and I haven't?"

02:36.240 --> 02:39.440
Thank you, Mr Molesley. I
couldn't have put it better myself.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.680
But why have they, Mr Carson?

02:41.760 --> 02:44.560
How is your job search going, Mr Barrow?

02:48.000 --> 02:52.480
But why should anyone pay to
see a perfectly ordinary house?

02:52.560 --> 02:54.950
Not everyone lives in a
house like Downton Abbey.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.720
Oh, roll up, roll up, visit
an actual dining room!

02:59.800 --> 03:03.160
Complete with a real
life table and chairs!

03:03.240 --> 03:06.240
People have always tipped the
butler to look 'round a house.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.320
Even Elizabeth Bennett wanted to
see what Pemberly was like inside.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.190
A decision which caused her a
great deal of embarrassment,

03:12.240 --> 03:14.070
if I remember the novel correctly.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.790
And what about Robert?
He's still very ill.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.830
He's on the mend. It's
been a few weeks now.

03:18.880 --> 03:23.230
- And Cora's very competent.
- Mmm, yes, she's competent.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.200
Leading a revolution
without turning a hair.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.950
Anyway, it's agreed. Downton Abbey
will open to the public for one day.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.950
Dr Clarkson is very grateful.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.960
Clarkson was there? Oh,
so he really has weakened.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.840
I prefer to think he
has begun to see sense.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.960
You believe that? Even after Robert's life

03:42.040 --> 03:45.840
was saved by a hospital being nearby?

03:45.920 --> 03:48.870
You think that changes things,
but as Lord Merton pointed out,

03:48.920 --> 03:51.990
Robert would have been treated
there even after the hand-over.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.240
Oh? How is Lord Merton?

03:56.480 --> 03:58.350
As he always is.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.920
And you? You weakening?

04:02.880 --> 04:04.020
No.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.320
- No!
- Mmm.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.110
Who was it?

04:11.160 --> 04:14.480
Bertie Pelham. He's going to be in London
on the 11th, and he wanted to meet up.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.510
Why don't you ask him to stop in here
on his way back to Northumberland?

04:17.560 --> 04:19.990
- If you'd like to.
- I would rather.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.270
- Is he worth it?
- As opposed to your car mechanic?

04:22.320 --> 04:24.590
I'm a car mechanic, thank you.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.680
We're opening the house that
weekend. He may have some ideas.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.900
Well, I'll ask him.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.350
I should go.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.030
I'm late as it is. I'll be back tomorrow.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.720
Don't feel you must look in every day.
You should be working for your exams.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.070
- It can't be long now.
- Not too long, no.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.440
Are you nervous? I should be.

04:56.520 --> 05:00.560
I do know it. The question is, can
I summon it up when the time comes?

05:00.640 --> 05:02.390
- Where are you taking them?
- The school.

05:02.440 --> 05:05.840
The headmaster will oversee it. Mr
Molesley's settling the details.

05:05.920 --> 05:09.960
- You owe him a great deal.
- I know. But he's enjoyed it, too.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.520
Oh.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.870
- This is for Mrs Patmore.
- What is it?

05:14.920 --> 05:17.260
A note to thank her. I'm grateful.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.720
- She already knows that.
- It never hurts to say it.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.080
You don't want to encourage her.
She's too curious for her own good.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.580
Just give her the note.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.760
- (CARSON CLEARS THROAT)
- Oh. This is good of you.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.590
You should've let one of
the footmen bring it up.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.160
I wanted to see how you are, My Lord,

05:37.600 --> 05:41.840
and... I thought you
might fancy some of this.

05:42.280 --> 05:44.550
Crumbs. That looks frightening.

05:44.880 --> 05:48.960
It's, uh, a little Chateau
Chasse-Spleen, My Lord.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.990
I put it in this for ease of carriage.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.380
Chasse Spleen? Now you're talking.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.870
I believe it was a
favourite of Lord Byron's.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.000
He knew a thing or two about
wine. (CHUCKLES) And women.

06:01.760 --> 06:02.790
(GROANS)

06:02.840 --> 06:06.640
But do you know, Carson, I think
I'm going to have to say no.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.270
- Really, my Lord?
- I'm afraid so.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.480
Sometimes in life
sacrifices have to be made,

06:13.640 --> 06:15.990
and I think the time has
come for me to accept

06:16.040 --> 06:18.070
that I cannot go on as I used to.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.470
I am very sorry to hear
you say so, My Lord.

06:20.520 --> 06:22.880
Not as sorry as I am. (SIGHS)

06:23.240 --> 06:27.480
And speaking of necessary sacrifices, I've
been thinking about things, lying here.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.590
We must get on with
simplifying the household.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.920
I know we've talked about it,
but we haven't really done much.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.120
Oh, the new maids live in the
village, and so cost a lot less.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.990
And we only have one
groom and a stable boy.

06:40.040 --> 06:43.920
But we still have an under butler and
two footmen. In this day and age.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.040
I do believe that Mr Barrow has genuinely
been looking for other employment.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.160
But not finding it. Is there
anything we can do to help?

06:51.240 --> 06:53.310
I'll speak to him, My Lord.

06:55.560 --> 06:58.110
What do you think of the plan
to open the house for a day?

06:58.160 --> 07:01.030
I think it's a dangerous
precedent, since you ask,

07:01.080 --> 07:03.710
but I'm not sure how useful
it is of me to say so.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.310
Dangerous? I think it's idiotic.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.230
It adds up to the same thing, My Lord.

07:07.280 --> 07:12.670
- It's a mistake. I suppose it's too
late to stop it now. - Far too late.

07:12.720 --> 07:16.920
But what on earth can we show them to give them
their money's worth? Lady Grantham knitting?

07:18.200 --> 07:21.120
(CHUCKLING) Lady Mary in the bath?

07:25.520 --> 07:27.360
What's this?

07:27.440 --> 07:29.510
Oh, it's addressed to me.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.680
Oh, it's from Mr Mason.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.190
- How did it get there?
- I wondered where I'd put it.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.590
- He asked me to give you it.
- Well, why didn't you, then?

07:36.640 --> 07:40.120
I couldn't find it. It must have
fallen in the rubbish by mistake.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.710
- Why had it been opened?
- Had it?

07:46.520 --> 07:50.000
Whatever happened to that man?
Do you know what his sentence was?

07:50.080 --> 07:54.040
- Ten years, m'lady.
- Ten years? My goodness.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.440
I know. I'm glad in a way I didn't
have to testify against him now.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.940
Good night, Baxter.

08:07.160 --> 08:10.800
(SIGHS) Are you here? What time is it?

08:10.880 --> 08:13.080
It's late. Go back to sleep.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.030
I think we ought to ask
Mama to come and see me.

08:17.080 --> 08:21.600
- She must be feeling rather left out.
- Her mind is on other things.

08:21.720 --> 08:25.720
She's hoping your operation will
persuade people over to her side.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.560
I would have died if I'd
had to be taken to York.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.760
But they'd still operate here in
an emergency, so nothing's changed.

08:34.039 --> 08:36.230
Well, let's not make it worse.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.380
I'm afraid it must get worse
before it gets better.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.230
What about a fire?

08:47.280 --> 08:49.310
It's a bit indulgent, but we've earned it.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.840
- Not for me. I'm going to bed.
- You're not feeling ill, are you?

08:52.920 --> 08:55.310
Anna, if you're not
well, you must tell me.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.270
We've finished with this business
of your keeping me in the dark.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.950
- I'm not ill exactly.
- Have you told Lady Mary?

09:01.000 --> 09:05.670
- I didn't like to bother her. - Bother her
first thing. - I could tell Dr Clarkson.

09:05.720 --> 09:08.430
No. You're seeing Dr Ryder
if you're seeing anybody.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.190
Don't be silly. We can't afford that.

09:10.240 --> 09:14.560
- I can't expect Lady Mary to keep shelling out.
- I'll pay. I have savings.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.590
- We're selling a house, aren't we?
- Yes. To buy another house.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.710
Now you're the one being
silly. Talk to her tomorrow.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.230
She'll agree with me. And I'm paying.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.550
I wouldn't mind having
breakfast here sometimes.

09:28.600 --> 09:32.240
- Not every day, but sometimes.
- I don't think anyone would object.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.070
How are you at making coffee?

09:34.120 --> 09:36.470
I can make coffee. It's not very hard.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.720
(CHUCKLES) That's where you're
wrong. There's quite an art to it.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.900
Uh, you might like to have
a word with Mrs Patmore.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.230
Of course. If you'd like me to.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.880
And I want to start bringing
things a little more up to standard.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.110
I wonder if we could have the
hall boy to do some polishing.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.950
I don't see why not.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.600
And you might ask one of the
maids about making the bed.

09:58.280 --> 10:03.040
- Isn't that good enough, either?
- It's not bad. I didn't mean that.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.760
But I do like those sharp corners.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.680
Well. I'm glad it's not bad.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.790
(SIGHS) I wish you'd told me before.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.520
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- What does Bates say?

10:15.600 --> 10:17.940
He wants me to see Dr Ryder again.

10:18.040 --> 10:21.320
He wants to pay, but it
seems an extravagance to me.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.940
I'm happy to talk to Dr Clarkson.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.990
No, let's go to London. I'm
sure Dr Clarkson could manage it,

10:27.040 --> 10:29.670
- but I feel like a jaunt.
- And stay the night?

10:29.720 --> 10:32.510
With Lady Rosamund. Pack
something for the evening.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.430
Medium smart. I'll make
some telephone calls.

10:37.760 --> 10:41.520
- I got your message. What's happened?
- I'll ring for some coffee.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.310
You sound as if you should
ring for some smelling salts.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.430
If you mean is it serious, it is.

10:46.480 --> 10:50.110
- I received a letter this morning
from the Board of Governors. - Go on.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.310
They are going to combine us with York.

10:52.360 --> 10:56.320
- As we knew they must.
- Indeed. I am to remain in my post here.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.110
- Good. - Mrs Crawley is
to stay on as our almoner.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.510
- Very sensible.
- But they want to offer

11:01.560 --> 11:04.510
- the role of president to you.
- Me? Why?

11:04.560 --> 11:07.030
You made a good impression
when you went into York.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.550
I don't understand. What about Mama?

11:09.800 --> 11:12.320
Lady Grantham is to be, and I quote,

11:12.400 --> 11:16.680
"Allowed to step down after so
many years of noble service."

11:18.600 --> 11:20.630
Golly. They've sacked the Captain.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.790
You can see their point. How could they have
someone in the management of the new system

11:24.840 --> 11:27.390
who thinks the whole idea
is a horrible mistake?

11:27.440 --> 11:29.950
- And you support this notion?
- Of course he does.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.030
He put your name forward as replacement.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.230
Lady Grantham is not as young as she was,

11:34.280 --> 11:38.680
- and, as Mrs Crawley says, I'm
afraid she'd be almost willing the
new regime to fail. - Probably.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.720
Besides, I want to involve the new president
in the logistics of running things.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.070
And she would never have
agreed to take that on.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.510
So, I'm to step into her
shoes and then be given

11:47.560 --> 11:49.310
more responsibility than she had?

11:49.360 --> 11:51.700
We both think you'd be marvellous.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.350
And who's going to tell her?

11:54.400 --> 11:57.400
They'll write, as soon
as they hear back from me.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.470
I need to talk to Lord Grantham.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.270
The thing is, we don't want someone
to come up with another name.

12:03.320 --> 12:07.280
Don't we? It might be easier
all round if they did.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.270
Good. I'll see you at 8:00.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.990
Don't tell him it's me.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.990
I want to be the surprise guest.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.240
Oh, you'll think of something.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.040
All right, bye.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.950
So this is the urgent business
that takes m'lady to London town?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.430
- It's not the only thing.
- But it is getting serious.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.710
Dinner with Evelyn
Napier at the Criterion?

12:31.760 --> 12:33.310
Doesn't sound very serious to me.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.270
I used to go to the
Criterion with Michael.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.790
Do you have to put a damper on
every restaurant in the capital?

12:37.840 --> 12:41.110
As a matter of fact, I have
very happy memories of it.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.470
Send him my best wishes. I
hope to see him again soon.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.750
Oh, Evelyn? Yes, send him my love, too.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.340
Evelyn or whoever else might be there.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.830
Why don't you come with me?
It'll be fun. I dare you.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.230
- You haven't been anywhere in ages.
- All right. I'll go and pack.

12:55.280 --> 12:58.190
We can't be too long. I want to be
sure we're ready for the opening.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.870
Oh, we've masses of time for
that. We'll be home tomorrow.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.110
Edith, you can manage for a
day without us, can't you?

13:03.160 --> 13:06.160
I can manage without you
for as long as you want.

13:07.560 --> 13:12.350
- Why don't you come with us? - And watch
Mary flirt with her oily driver? No, thank you.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.880
- Can't you be pleased for her?
- I'm as pleased for her as she would be for me.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.790
Barrow, you mustn't let him wear you out.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.710
Oh, he's all right, m'lady. Aren't you?

13:24.760 --> 13:28.110
- I was cheering him up.
- That's not what it looked like.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.190
Do you need cheering up, Barrow?

13:30.240 --> 13:32.580
We all need it sometimes, m'lady.

13:33.360 --> 13:37.160
I mean it, George. You must let
Mr Barrow get on with his work.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.790
Again, again...

13:39.840 --> 13:42.640
All right. And off we go!

13:42.720 --> 13:44.720
(IMITATES ENGINE RUNNING)

13:54.240 --> 13:58.400
We're off. I'm taking Tom.
It's time he had a break.

13:58.480 --> 14:02.160
Oh, I envy you. I'm so sick
of this room, I could scream.

14:04.080 --> 14:07.240
Barrow was in the gallery, looking
rather glum. Do we know why?

14:07.320 --> 14:10.440
We've talked about making
changes in the household.

14:10.520 --> 14:13.510
Carson and I both feel
he's the obvious candidate.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.070
You're not going to sack him?

14:15.120 --> 14:17.230
I hope not. I hope he's
going to find another job.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.800
Oh. I see. Well, that explains it.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.790
He's awfully sweet with
George and the girls.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.600
- You do know that? - And when
George is older, he can ask him back.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.310
Goodbye, darling.

14:30.960 --> 14:34.000
- Get some rest.
- (SCOFFS) Rest.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.390
Don't worry, Bates.
We'll have her home soon.

14:38.440 --> 14:41.310
I don't think there'll be anything
to concern ourselves about.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.950
Anna has an appointment this evening.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.870
I'll telephone you
after. Mr Mead won't mind.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.780
I'm very grateful to you,
m'lady, for arranging it,

14:50.080 --> 14:52.030
but Anna will ask him to send me the bill.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.400
Dr Ryder was my idea, not yours.

14:54.480 --> 14:57.560
And it was a good idea, m'lady.
An idea that has brought us

14:57.640 --> 15:00.510
to within shouting distance
of our greatest happiness.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.230
But I can pay my way, and I'd
be more comfortable to do so.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.840
Very well. We won't fight about it.

15:09.360 --> 15:13.520
- Will you miss me? - I miss you when
you're out of sight, never mind London.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.240
I'm glad to hear it, Mr Bates.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.280
I won't let them send him the bill.

15:22.440 --> 15:26.160
That's not kind. His pride is more
important to him than the money.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.110
Thank you, Mr Branson.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.920
Mr Barrow, in 20 years' time,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.750
I doubt there's one footman
working at Downton.

15:39.800 --> 15:43.880
Lady Edith already manages without her
own maid, and if Anna were to leave,

15:43.960 --> 15:46.880
I doubt that Lady Mary would replace her.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.040
- It's not just you.
- But I am the first.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.360
But you are the under butler,

15:52.440 --> 15:56.320
a post that is fragrant with
memories of a lost world.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.360
No-one is sorrier to say it than I am,

15:59.440 --> 16:02.960
- but you are not a creature of today.
- And you are?

16:03.040 --> 16:07.280
I don't believe that a house like
Downton could be run without a butler.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.230
In that sense, yes, I am.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.790
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

16:11.840 --> 16:15.000
- Oh, you're busy.
- No, no. We're finished, Mrs Hughes.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.240
Or at least one of us is.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.560
Good day, Mr Carson.

16:22.600 --> 16:27.560
- (CLOSING DOOR) - I thought we might
have our dinner at the cottage tonight.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.120
- If you like. - Perhaps you could
get some guidance from Mrs Patmore?

16:31.400 --> 16:33.550
It doesn't have to be
anything very complicated.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.240
Doesn't it? (CHUCKLES) That's a relief.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.990
I'll give you the date
as soon as I have it.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.830
Right. I'm quite excited.
How mad is that? (CHUCKLES)

16:45.880 --> 16:48.350
Can Mrs Patmore spare Daisy for the day?

16:48.400 --> 16:50.790
For it will be the whole
day. There are six papers.

16:50.840 --> 16:55.080
Oh, they'll spare her. Everyone
there thinks she's taking the right
step. Especially Her Ladyship.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.560
I hope they appreciate your role
in all this. You've been very kind.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.400
Well, I think it's because I
missed the boat that I feel

17:02.480 --> 17:05.150
it's so important for others to catch it.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.440
Mr Molesley, I've had an idea.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.869
- What would you say to
helping me out? - What?

17:12.920 --> 17:15.230
I'm not necessarily
suggesting you might teach.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.109
I need a clearer idea of what you know.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.390
But I like your respect for education.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.520
I like your enthusiasm, and I
want to harness it if I can.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.910
Oh, I don't know what to say.

17:25.960 --> 17:29.000
First you can decide if you'd
sit a test of my own devising,

17:29.560 --> 17:32.230
of general knowledge as much as anything.

17:34.280 --> 17:38.200
This is kind of you, Mama, but
as you can see, I'm miles better.

17:38.320 --> 17:43.240
I assumed it was a good sign that
I hadn't been summoned in haste.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Anyway, I'm here and I'm glad
of the chance to talk about

17:48.080 --> 17:50.960
this mad scheme of opening the house.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.150
It's all fixed, Mama. By Mary.

17:53.200 --> 17:58.120
Well, why anyone would come
beats me, but, since it is,

17:58.240 --> 18:02.640
should I cut a ribbon when
the doors are flung open?

18:02.720 --> 18:03.790
Uh, well...

18:03.840 --> 18:07.360
As president of the hospital,
I ought to have a formal role.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.270
That is why we are raising funds.

18:09.320 --> 18:15.120
I don't believe we need a ceremony.
The doors will be open from 9:00.
Who'd want to get here for then?

18:15.200 --> 18:18.600
- Well, it wouldn't kill me.
- No, but it might kill us.

18:18.720 --> 18:22.080
Oh, well, let me know what you decide.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.120
The patients are my priority.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.560
As president, I am their
representative on earth.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.590
I have a feeling your
collapse will have changed

18:32.640 --> 18:36.800
a lot of people's minds
about the so-called reforms.

18:36.920 --> 18:40.400
Don't worry. I shall be
magnanimous in victory.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.590
Is everything ready for tonight?

18:45.640 --> 18:49.240
I think so. You're not
expecting a banquet, are you?

18:49.320 --> 18:52.400
I'm expecting a delicious dinner
prepared by the fair hands

18:52.480 --> 18:54.480
of my beautiful wife.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.550
There's a threat in there somewhere.

18:56.600 --> 19:00.560
I don't understand. He wants you
to sit the exam as well as Daisy?

19:00.640 --> 19:04.080
Oh, no. Not matric. He wants
to assess my general knowledge.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.360
- With a view to...
- He wasn't very specific.

19:08.680 --> 19:12.320
I'd guess he didn't want to make
a promise he might have to break.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.110
Are you going to take the test?

19:14.160 --> 19:18.040
If Mr Carson gives me the time
off. What have I got to lose?

19:23.080 --> 19:25.990
We'll meet upstairs after our
dinner. My room or yours?

19:26.040 --> 19:29.080
- I don't mind.
- Mine, then. The lighting's better.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.840
(CLEARS THROAT)

19:39.720 --> 19:42.230
You're back. I thought I was
going to have to dress myself.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.950
I am so sorry, m'lady. Only,
I could not get a bus.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.830
Never mind. What did he say?

19:46.880 --> 19:50.560
It's fine. Standard pregnancy pain.
Something to do with the ligament,

19:50.640 --> 19:52.830
- but don't ask me what.
- I won't.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.400
He gave me exercises and suggested
a warm towel if it lingers,

19:56.480 --> 19:58.430
but it's just the body adjusting.

19:58.480 --> 20:01.840
I don't think ligaments were invented
when I was having Master George.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.670
Master George does make me laugh.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.550
He rules Mr Barrow with a rod of iron.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.950
Yes, Barrow's rather
sweet with the children.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.070
Do you think he's trying
to get in with us?

20:10.120 --> 20:16.240
I'd say he's genuine, m'lady. I
doubt he'll have any children of
his own, and he enjoys their company.

20:16.440 --> 20:19.480
Miss Marigold's fitted
in surprisingly well.

20:19.800 --> 20:23.120
- Yes, but then they're all...
- They're all what?

20:24.200 --> 20:26.470
They're all clever and pleasant.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.110
What were you going to say?

20:29.160 --> 20:31.270
Just what I did say, m'lady.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.230
Now, has Mr Talbot found
out you're coming tonight?

20:34.280 --> 20:38.030
No. I suppose I should
have jumped out of a cake.

20:38.080 --> 20:41.080
But then you'd have to wait for
the pudding before you saw him.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.240
I must give Clarkson an answer, or
Mama will find out some other way,

20:45.320 --> 20:47.390
before the letter arrives.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.560
This is a secret, Baxter.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.960
- Of course. Will that be all?
- Yes, thank you.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.420
That was high risk.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.070
Not really. She won't talk.

21:04.600 --> 21:08.000
- Anyway, it'll be public soon.
- I suppose you want to accept?

21:08.120 --> 21:11.920
I do. But not if it will upset you.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.100
Mama's the one who'll be
upset when she's deposed.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.680
Although the fact you're the
usurper who's stolen her throne

21:18.760 --> 21:22.390
- will clearly make it worse.
- But if that wasn't an element?

21:22.440 --> 21:24.910
I only worry if it's too much for you.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.670
It sounds as if Clarkson
almost wants you to work there.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.360
So?

21:29.960 --> 21:33.260
I've had one career already,
bringing up my daughters.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.110
They don't need me now,
so I'm ready for the next.

21:36.160 --> 21:39.600
The girls still need you. But
anyway, isn't it time for a rest?

21:39.680 --> 21:41.550
- You're not like Isobel.
- In what way?

21:41.600 --> 21:43.940
I only mean you don't need a job.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.790
I don't think she needs a
job. I think she wants a job.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.910
She enjoys it, so would I.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.830
- I'm not old, Robert.
- I didn't say you were.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.360
Didn't you?

22:09.220 --> 22:12.130
If Anna says she doesn't know
anything, I'm sure she doesn't.

22:12.180 --> 22:13.890
Why must there be something to know?

22:13.940 --> 22:17.220
If I find out you knew and didn't
tell me, I'd be terribly upset.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.730
- I'd see it as a real betrayal.
- Don't say that.

22:19.780 --> 22:21.730
So you are in on it.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.770
- Welcome. - Evelyn!
- My hand is complete.

22:23.820 --> 22:24.850
Darling.

22:24.900 --> 22:27.410
Heavens. We are quite a party.

22:27.460 --> 22:31.140
You know Lady Anne Acland,
Mrs Dupper and Mrs McVeigh?

22:31.340 --> 22:35.370
Anne and I shared a governess,
and Jill and I came out together.

22:35.420 --> 22:39.570
Small world. You know Henry Talbot, and I
think you met Charlie Rogers up at Brancaster.

22:39.620 --> 22:43.460
- We've met again since then.
- This is Mary's brother-in-law, Tom Branson.

22:43.540 --> 22:45.680
- Hello.
- You're over here.

22:46.620 --> 22:50.260
I shall read lots into your wanting
to be a surprise. Am I right?

22:52.780 --> 22:55.570
A table of singletons
at our age, well done.

22:55.620 --> 22:57.960
Single now, we're all war widows.

22:58.020 --> 23:01.260
I am not a war widow. Good
to see you again, Mr Rogers.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.090
You, too. Although I haven't
been allowed to forget you.

23:04.140 --> 23:06.210
Henry talks of nothing and nobody else.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.530
Oh, I didn't think he knew
enough about me for that.

23:08.580 --> 23:12.180
- Tell me, are you pleased with your
progress this season? - I certainly am.

23:12.260 --> 23:15.980
- We're both driving at Brooklands next month.
- In the car you tested in Yorkshire?

23:16.060 --> 23:18.650
Exactly. See? We'll get
you interested yet.

23:18.700 --> 23:20.930
- No, you won't.
- Well, you've got me interested.

23:20.980 --> 23:23.330
- Would you want to come?
- I don't get down to London much.

23:23.380 --> 23:26.730
Well, you're here tonight. Why not come
specially? Watch from the pits with the team.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.260
- Yes, I think you'd enjoy it.
- I know I'd enjoy it. Mary?

23:30.340 --> 23:32.850
- Tom, you should go if you like.
- And what about you?

23:32.900 --> 23:35.940
Well, I don't keep my diary in
my head. Ask me nearer the time.

23:36.020 --> 23:37.560
(ALL CHUCKLE)

23:38.260 --> 23:39.660
(CLANKING)

23:40.620 --> 23:42.290
How are we doing?

23:47.340 --> 23:48.930
Ah, what is it?

23:48.980 --> 23:53.180
Um, Glenvere smoked salmon, from
last night's upstairs dinner.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.010
- Lemon?
- Oh.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.650
- I don't believe it.
- What?

23:58.700 --> 24:02.620
Mrs Patmore gave me two lemons, and
I left them on the kitchen table.

24:02.940 --> 24:06.780
I'll tell you what would be
nice with this. Some horseradish,

24:06.860 --> 24:09.260
thinned with a little soured cream.

24:09.380 --> 24:13.780
I agree. That would be heavenly.
Except that we don't have any.

24:13.860 --> 24:16.410
- Ah.
- What are we drinking with it?

24:16.460 --> 24:18.930
The thing is, I don't
think we should drink.

24:18.980 --> 24:21.450
Not if His Lordship feels
obliged to give it up.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.660
But His Lordship is suffering
from a burst ulcer. We're not.

24:24.740 --> 24:27.290
I know, I know. But
somehow it feels disloyal.

24:27.340 --> 24:30.210
He is my officer, and I
should follow his lead.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.360
- And it won't make you grumpy?
- I don't think so.

24:34.660 --> 24:36.260
What's next?

24:38.740 --> 24:40.300
- Duck.
- Oh.

24:40.380 --> 24:44.490
Is the skin crispy like Mrs Patmore
does it? Did you ask her advice?

24:44.540 --> 24:47.450
We certainly talked about what
it's like to cook dinner for you.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.440
- Ah, I bet she had a lot to say.
- We both did.

24:52.700 --> 24:53.890
(CLANKING)

24:53.940 --> 24:56.770
- Good night. Shall I get us a taxi?
- Well, it's such a lovely night.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.810
Why don't I walk you back?
Where are you based?

24:58.860 --> 25:01.050
We're staying with my
aunt in Belgrave Square.

25:01.100 --> 25:04.200
- Perfect. What do you say?
- I think it'd be nice.

25:05.020 --> 25:08.420
Except I have a lot of reading to do,
so I might just go straight back.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.890
- Only if you're sure, Tom.
- I'm sure.

25:10.940 --> 25:13.250
- He'd better be sure.
- Well, I hope we meet again.

25:13.300 --> 25:17.260
Perhaps at Brooklands. You'd have a good
time. It's really quite swanky these days.

25:17.340 --> 25:19.650
How enchanting you make it sound.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.610
Goodbye, Evelyn.

25:21.660 --> 25:23.940
- You're a darling.
- Shall we?

25:28.700 --> 25:30.410
I hope you will come south next month.

25:30.460 --> 25:34.780
Partly to watch me driving of course,
but mainly so that I can see you.

25:35.540 --> 25:39.890
- And I know you're not interested in racing.
- It's not only that.

25:39.940 --> 25:42.290
I don't know why I haven't
told you before now,

25:42.340 --> 25:44.450
but...

25:44.500 --> 25:46.690
Matthew died in a car crash.

25:46.740 --> 25:49.290
Yes, I know. Evelyn told me.

25:49.340 --> 25:52.890
- So you understand.
- Of course I understand.

25:52.940 --> 25:56.980
The car is your enemy. But it's my friend,

25:57.060 --> 26:00.420
and all I ask is that you
give it a second chance.

26:01.100 --> 26:04.700
After all, it's not as if you're
driving around in a Hansom cab.

26:05.140 --> 26:08.740
- (THUNDER RUMBLING)
- Excellent. Um, in here.

26:09.780 --> 26:11.380
(LAUGHING)

26:28.020 --> 26:32.780
Heavens, Mr Talbot. Is this
part of your plan to convince me?

26:34.020 --> 26:36.490
Look. You don't have
to if you don't want to.

26:36.540 --> 26:40.540
- Plenty of drivers' wives never
go near the race track. - Wives?

26:40.980 --> 26:43.130
I only meant that if we do get involved,

26:43.180 --> 26:45.290
it doesn't have to be part of the plan.

26:45.340 --> 26:47.130
It's not compulsory.

26:47.180 --> 26:49.330
But you'd like me there to watch?

26:49.380 --> 26:52.300
Yes, but only so I can be near you.

26:53.420 --> 26:55.530
Henry, to be honest,

26:55.580 --> 26:58.290
this is moving much
faster than I'd imagined.

26:58.340 --> 27:01.580
Look, I know I'm not what you're after.

27:02.580 --> 27:05.500
My prospects are modest
at best, and you...

27:05.620 --> 27:09.180
Well, you're a great catch.

27:10.460 --> 27:15.100
But you're also a woman that I
happen to be falling in love with.

27:17.180 --> 27:19.210
Gosh, that sounds rather
feeble, doesn't it?

27:19.260 --> 27:23.020
No, not at all. As an argument,
I think it's rather compelling.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.500
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

27:28.220 --> 27:29.970
It doesn't show any signs of stopping.

27:30.020 --> 27:32.220
- No.
- Should we run for it?

27:32.620 --> 27:34.700
Well, you're the boss.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.340
Come on. Careful.

27:42.820 --> 27:45.410
- Were you caught in the rain?
- Not too badly.

27:45.460 --> 27:48.400
We dashed for cover till
it slackened off a bit.

27:49.340 --> 27:52.410
- How romantic.
- Why are you playing Cupid?

27:52.460 --> 27:56.930
He's nice, he's mad about you and
he loves cars. I rest my case.

27:56.980 --> 27:58.730
I don't see how it would work.

27:58.780 --> 28:03.250
Why? He'll have to settle down eventually, go
into business. Why couldn't he do it from Downton?

28:03.300 --> 28:05.330
- I know...
- He won't be as rich as you.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.050
He won't be as rich as your child.

28:07.100 --> 28:10.600
But he's a gentleman. And if
I say that, it must be true.

28:10.980 --> 28:14.140
- Would you like a drink?
- Just a tiny glass of whisky and water.

28:15.940 --> 28:18.850
- When does Edith's beau arrive?
- Friday.

28:18.900 --> 28:22.050
- Just in time to interfere with the opening.
- I liked him when we met.

28:22.100 --> 28:25.540
- He seemed a decent sort.
- But boring to an Olympic degree.

28:26.580 --> 28:29.680
If Edith's happy, it
improves things for everyone.

28:30.540 --> 28:33.290
She's so stupid to have
saddled herself with a child.

28:33.340 --> 28:36.780
I mean, Marigold's sweet, but why
would any man want to take her on?

28:50.660 --> 28:52.800
I thought you'd forgotten me.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.170
Thank God I've found you.

28:55.220 --> 28:57.930
The car wouldn't start, so I
had to get Stark to do it.

28:57.980 --> 29:00.930
I'm glad I don't have to walk
the whole length of the drive.

29:00.980 --> 29:03.320
- Hop in.
- I will. But first...

29:07.980 --> 29:11.220
That feels so nice and automatic.

29:11.820 --> 29:14.500
- Which is good?
- It is for me.

29:19.980 --> 29:21.970
I hope you don't mind my taking a chance,

29:22.020 --> 29:25.020
but I got your letter and
I wanted to discuss it.

29:25.300 --> 29:28.130
This is Miss Cruikshank.
She's engaged to Larry.

29:28.180 --> 29:31.860
- Yes. I saw it in the papers.
- I know I've rather pushed in,

29:32.020 --> 29:35.450
- but I did so want to meet you.
- Does your fiance know you're here?

29:35.500 --> 29:38.410
I gather you and he haven't exactly
seen eye to eye in the past.

29:38.460 --> 29:39.930
Not exactly, no.

29:39.980 --> 29:44.740
As you can imagine, I was amazed
and very pleased when she asked
if she could join me to pay a call.

29:44.820 --> 29:47.650
You mustn't blame him.
It was completely my idea.

29:47.700 --> 29:50.180
Mmm. Well, life is full of surprises.

29:50.260 --> 29:54.300
- I know you and Larry rather got off on the
wrong foot. - That's one way of describing it.

29:54.380 --> 29:58.660
Well, please know not all of Lord
Merton's family feel the same way.

29:59.660 --> 30:01.000
Goodness.

30:01.460 --> 30:04.960
After that, I don't know if I
can concentrate on business.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.810
I wondered if old Lady Grantham
had received the letter.

30:07.860 --> 30:12.500
Not that I've heard of. Although Dr Clarkson
has told them that Cora is happy to serve.

30:12.580 --> 30:15.890
Uh, only we're coming to the house
opening on Saturday to support it.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.010
Well, don't say anything if you see her.

30:18.060 --> 30:21.900
I hate things like this. We'll all come
off very badly when she does find out.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.650
- I'm afraid that's
probably true. - Mmm.

30:26.620 --> 30:29.610
It's odd to think you'll be sitting
side by side, writing exams.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.730
Well, my paper won't be
anything like as long as Daisy's.

30:31.780 --> 30:33.730
- She's got six to do.
- Thanks.

30:33.780 --> 30:36.610
I admire you, Daisy. To give
yourself a second chance.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.850
When the time comes,
Daisy'll need some lunch.

30:38.900 --> 30:40.770
- Maybe I will, as well.
- Well, I've thought of that.

30:40.820 --> 30:42.810
I'll do lunch for Mr Dawes, too.

30:42.860 --> 30:46.700
You could ask Mr Mason to join
you on the day. He'd enjoy that.

30:46.780 --> 30:49.050
Don't bother him, not when
he's got so much work to do.

30:49.100 --> 30:52.340
I'll tell him as soon as we have a
date. See if he'd like to look in.

30:52.420 --> 30:54.570
I don't understand why you
can't just leave him alone.

30:54.620 --> 30:58.340
- Daisy, that's not very gracious.
- Well, I don't!

31:00.140 --> 31:02.770
It's nerves. She's worked
long enough for this moment.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.690
It's partially nerves, yes.

31:04.740 --> 31:09.340
But I don't think it's all nerves.
And I will write a note to Mr Mason.

31:15.900 --> 31:18.570
This is nice. Now we can go down together.

31:18.660 --> 31:21.130
- Less nervous making.
- Absolutely.

31:21.220 --> 31:23.730
But I was going to look
into the night nursery first.

31:23.780 --> 31:26.060
- Can I come?
- Of course.

31:28.380 --> 31:30.180
Good evening, Nanny.

31:30.300 --> 31:32.250
- This is Mr Pelham.
- Good evening, sir.

31:32.300 --> 31:34.410
- Good evening.
- M'lady, could you be here

31:34.460 --> 31:37.620
- while I just run down to
the sewing room? - Of course.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.650
This is Mary's son, George,

31:41.700 --> 31:45.420
and my late sister
Sybil's daughter, Sybbie.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.770
And this is Marigold.

31:52.660 --> 31:54.820
God bless you, Marigold.

31:55.820 --> 31:58.360
What a lovely place this is to grow up.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.900
I hope so.

32:01.500 --> 32:06.290
I'm an experienced housemaid and a
housekeeper for how many years? And
he doesn't think I can make a bed.

32:06.340 --> 32:09.130
Well, you always knew he was
old to be trained as a husband.

32:09.180 --> 32:11.330
- Good evening.
- What are you doing here?

32:11.380 --> 32:12.810
I thought I'd look in.

32:12.860 --> 32:16.060
- What's that for? - I brought these
to say thank you to Mrs Patmore.

32:16.140 --> 32:19.460
- You've already said thank you.
- That's very nice of you, Mr Mason.

32:19.540 --> 32:22.330
Why bother? Have you seen
the kitchen gardens here?

32:22.380 --> 32:25.900
There's enough vegetables to feed an
army. You need 'em more than we do.

32:25.980 --> 32:30.060
Oh, never mind her, Mr Mason.
I think it's a lovely thing,

32:30.140 --> 32:32.850
to have fresh farm vegetables just for me.

32:32.900 --> 32:35.460
I'll make soup and stock and all sorts.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.130
Well...

32:37.180 --> 32:39.050
I'll leave you to it.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.690
You've probably thought of
this, but I'd place someone,

32:44.740 --> 32:46.930
maybe a servant, in each
room the public will enter.

32:46.980 --> 32:48.770
- Just to keep an eye on things.
- Literally.

32:48.820 --> 32:51.650
- I think that's a good idea.
- Carson, can you sort it out?

32:51.700 --> 32:54.860
Of course, m'lady. I understand
it's only the ground floor.

32:54.940 --> 32:57.850
And not too much of that. They'll
start in the small library,

32:57.900 --> 33:00.290
then through the big library,
into the painted room,

33:00.340 --> 33:02.610
the drawing room, the smoking
room, the great hall,

33:02.660 --> 33:04.450
in and out of the dining
room and back outside.

33:04.500 --> 33:07.050
Rope off across the
staircases and the back wing.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.970
Who are the guides?

33:09.020 --> 33:12.100
Do we need guides? Can't they just
have a look and leave it at that?

33:12.180 --> 33:15.220
I don't think so. Not if you
want them to go away happy,

33:15.300 --> 33:17.410
and leave behind what's not theirs.

33:17.460 --> 33:19.650
Who knows about the history of the house?

33:19.700 --> 33:22.900
Only our librarian, Mr
Pattinson, but he's away.

33:23.300 --> 33:26.940
You'll have to fake it. Lady
Mary, Edith, Mr Branson...

33:27.020 --> 33:30.180
Not me. I don't know a thing.
I'll sell tickets, but that's it.

33:30.300 --> 33:34.580
Well, then, Lady Grantham, you and your
daughters can take parties of 10 each,

33:34.660 --> 33:36.890
with no more than 30 in
the house at any one time.

33:36.940 --> 33:38.450
- Crikey.
- Heavens.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.570
I feel like the Belgians
waiting for the invasion.

33:40.620 --> 33:42.660
Or the monkeys in a zoo.

33:45.060 --> 33:48.890
- Do you all know your positions?
- Are we allowed to sit, Mr Carson?

33:48.940 --> 33:51.740
Well, the place will
be open for nine hours.

33:52.260 --> 33:54.530
Find an inconspicuous chair in the corner,

33:54.580 --> 33:58.260
but keep a sharp eye out and stand
if any member of the family comes in.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.730
What about the upstairs luncheon?

33:59.780 --> 34:03.340
- Sandwiches in Her Ladyship's room.
- We'll set up two of the tea tables.

34:03.420 --> 34:08.540
Mr Molesley can serve, and his place
in the hall will be taken by Daisy.

34:09.020 --> 34:10.889
And look respectable.

34:11.060 --> 34:12.340
Right.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.330
Do you know where my walking stick is?

34:16.380 --> 34:19.090
I thought I might equip
myself with it for tomorrow.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.290
In case you catch a thief red-handed?

34:21.340 --> 34:24.620
You never know. But
it's not at the cottage.

34:24.699 --> 34:28.210
And I wonder if it might have
got left behind in my wardrobe.

34:28.260 --> 34:31.620
- He knows a lot about everything.
- The trouble is, I think he does.

34:32.380 --> 34:35.010
- Did you enjoy our London spree?
- I did.

34:35.060 --> 34:37.770
Have you decided if you're coming
to Brooklands? I will if you will.

34:37.820 --> 34:40.290
I know I won't enjoy it one
bit, but at the same time...

34:40.340 --> 34:43.050
- You'd like to see him again.
- It's not that.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.530
I could see him for a walk in the park.

34:45.580 --> 34:48.980
No, I suppose I want to get
over it. To get over myself.

34:49.060 --> 34:52.139
He asked me if I'd give cars
another chance. Perhaps I should.

34:52.219 --> 34:54.250
Who is this flexible
and reasonable person?

34:54.300 --> 34:57.040
I don't recognise my
own dear sister, Mary.

34:57.620 --> 35:00.090
- Could this be love?
- Oh, shut up.

35:01.100 --> 35:04.860
He seems nice, and he's certainly
organised. Tom was quite jealous.

35:04.940 --> 35:08.340
But what are his prospects? An
agent stuck up in Northumberland

35:08.420 --> 35:10.050
managing someone else's estate?

35:10.100 --> 35:11.930
What are Edith's prospects?

35:11.980 --> 35:15.180
Oh, I don't know. With her magazine,
I think she could develop into

35:15.260 --> 35:17.370
one of the interesting women of the day.

35:17.420 --> 35:20.940
Ten years ago, that very idea
would have filled you with horror.

35:21.020 --> 35:23.930
I've changed, you've
changed, the world's changed.

35:23.980 --> 35:26.980
He is a gentleman. You can't
object to him on that score.

35:27.060 --> 35:30.050
If she loves him, I don't
object to him on any score.

35:30.100 --> 35:31.610
But I don't think we should encourage it.

35:31.660 --> 35:34.290
She took him to meet Marigold,
but she didn't tell him why.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.930
- Nor should she.
- She must eventually.

35:36.980 --> 35:39.520
Let her make that decision for herself.

35:40.500 --> 35:44.020
Now, you need some sleep before
your hideous day tomorrow.

35:44.180 --> 35:45.540
(GROANS)

35:45.780 --> 35:47.180
(CHUCKLES)

35:54.260 --> 35:57.340
Andrew? What were you
doing in Mr Barrow's room?

35:57.460 --> 35:59.820
We were... I was borrowing a book.

35:59.900 --> 36:02.650
What book? Where is it?

36:02.700 --> 36:06.820
I left it there. I'll get it in the
morning. Good night, Mr Carson.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.730
Oh, Andrew, Andrew, place
the table here, please.

36:25.780 --> 36:27.780
Yes, Mr Carson.

36:31.020 --> 36:32.960
Thank you, Mr Molesley.

36:50.620 --> 36:54.300
I'm sorry for the wait, can
you form parties of 10?

36:54.380 --> 36:57.020
We've been here since 9:00.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.610
You are in the next group.

36:59.860 --> 37:01.660
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

37:03.380 --> 37:06.060
No, the third Earl built it.

37:06.140 --> 37:09.340
Well, he didn't really build
it so much as envelope it,

37:09.420 --> 37:13.020
because this room is originally medieval.

37:13.260 --> 37:15.410
It was the monks' refectory of an abbey

37:15.460 --> 37:18.500
that King Henry sold after the
Dissolution of the Monasteries.

37:19.700 --> 37:22.240
Is that why it's called Downton Abbey?

37:22.940 --> 37:25.140
I guess so.

37:25.220 --> 37:26.890
Who painted that?

37:27.460 --> 37:29.980
I'm not sure, but this...

37:33.620 --> 37:36.660
This is a Reynolds, so
that is worth looking at.

37:37.940 --> 37:40.010
And that's quite good, too.

37:40.060 --> 37:42.130
Tell us about these people.

37:42.740 --> 37:46.250
Oh, well, they were all rather marvellous

37:46.300 --> 37:49.420
and sort of living that life.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.170
- It's not very cosy, is it?
- Isn't it?

37:52.460 --> 37:55.860
It is cosy at night, with
the lamps and the fire.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.410
What about the architect?

37:57.460 --> 38:00.980
Sir Charles Barry? Yes, he
built the Houses of Parliament,

38:01.700 --> 38:03.840
or at least he finished them.

38:04.460 --> 38:08.940
And, you know, he built
lots of lovely big buildings.

38:09.980 --> 38:13.140
No, that's him, I think. Or his son.

38:13.780 --> 38:15.850
Or it might be his father.

38:16.340 --> 38:17.810
Who's the little girl?

38:17.860 --> 38:20.420
Ah, the little girl is a little boy,

38:20.500 --> 38:24.260
but who I could not say. Ah,
Granny, thank God you're here.

38:24.340 --> 38:27.130
What else could I tell
them about the library?

38:27.180 --> 38:30.900
The library was assembled by
the fourth Earl. He loved books.

38:30.980 --> 38:34.980
- What else did he collect?
- Horses and women. Where's your mother?

38:35.060 --> 38:37.900
- She's in the great hall.
- Thank you.

38:39.220 --> 38:41.170
Excuse me please. Thank you.

38:41.220 --> 38:44.160
Why are those shields on
the chimneypiece blank?

38:45.420 --> 38:48.210
Do you know, I've never
really noticed that before.

38:48.260 --> 38:51.090
Isn't that strange? I haven't
a clue is the answer.

38:51.140 --> 38:52.340
Cora!

38:53.900 --> 38:54.930
Excuse me.

38:54.980 --> 38:57.500
Did you know when I was last here?

38:57.900 --> 38:59.770
Mama, I think maybe we should...

38:59.820 --> 39:02.340
Did you know when I was last here?

39:05.100 --> 39:09.300
And you let me babble on about
my victory? Have you told Robert?

39:09.380 --> 39:13.300
- Mama, you of all people don't want
to bore our vis... - Just be quiet.

39:13.380 --> 39:16.260
Excuse me. Hmm. Oh!

39:20.020 --> 39:23.140
- Are you all right? - I was going
to see if Her Ladyship needs anything.

39:23.220 --> 39:26.340
She needs a glass of water and a
fan, if you'd heard what I heard.

39:28.420 --> 39:31.860
- What is it?
- I've had a letter. From Coyle.

39:32.300 --> 39:35.170
- What? - He wants me
to visit him in prison.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.700
Well, don't even answer it. Ignore
it completely. Throw it on the fire.

39:38.780 --> 39:41.650
Mr Molesley, there's no-one
on duty in the library!

39:41.700 --> 39:43.570
Right away, Mr Carson.

39:45.420 --> 39:46.620
Uh...

39:51.540 --> 39:54.170
Daisy, can you relieve me? I
ought to get the tables upstairs.

39:54.220 --> 39:58.580
- What about the sandwiches? - I'll
take them up when I've got the
tables organised. - Oh, tablecloths!

39:58.900 --> 40:00.140
Oh.

40:01.260 --> 40:04.250
You wouldn't believe what happened
up there. In front of everyone.

40:04.300 --> 40:06.170
Oh? Try me.

40:06.220 --> 40:10.820
My son's wife, whom I have
treated like a daughter.

40:10.900 --> 40:14.890
- Too like. - That she should
connive at my humiliation,

40:14.940 --> 40:17.530
should revel as I am cast into the dust.

40:17.580 --> 40:21.380
Steady the buffs. Cora doesn't
control this any more than you.

40:21.460 --> 40:25.020
You've had different opinions,
but neither of you made it happen.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.970
If only Mr Chamberlain had spoken...

40:28.020 --> 40:31.890
He was never going to say
a word. The truth is, Mama,

40:31.940 --> 40:34.570
officialdom doesn't care
what we think any more.

40:34.620 --> 40:36.610
Our influence is finished.

40:36.660 --> 40:40.420
You can say that! You, whose
very life has been saved.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.170
You know dealing with
emergencies won't be affected.

40:43.220 --> 40:46.850
- Do be logical.
- I am sick and tired of logic!

40:46.900 --> 40:50.090
If I could choose between
principle and logic,

40:50.140 --> 40:52.620
I'd take principle every time!

40:53.100 --> 40:56.330
Just tell Cora I do not
wish to see her face

40:56.380 --> 40:59.380
until I'm used to having
a traitor in the family!

41:00.140 --> 41:02.140
(SIGHS)

41:04.980 --> 41:07.340
Why is she in such a tizzy?

41:08.220 --> 41:12.460
Well, you know mothers. They get
terribly wrought up about things.

41:12.620 --> 41:14.890
- My mum does.
- There you are.

41:15.020 --> 41:16.780
Mine does too.

41:19.900 --> 41:21.970
May I ask what you're doing here?

41:22.020 --> 41:25.100
I come to see your house.
With my mum and dad.

41:26.340 --> 41:27.850
Do they know where you are?

41:27.900 --> 41:32.100
- No. Why is it so big, your house?
- I'm not sure, really.

41:33.020 --> 41:35.130
It's the way they used to manage things.

41:35.180 --> 41:37.210
Well, why not buy somewhere comfy?

41:37.260 --> 41:39.860
- You must have enough money.
- Maybe.

41:40.620 --> 41:44.540
But you know how it is. You
like what you're used to.

41:45.380 --> 41:47.380
(APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS)

41:50.260 --> 41:51.690
Why are you in here?

41:51.740 --> 41:54.820
- Wouldn't you like to know!
- Cheeky rascal!

41:55.180 --> 41:57.380
Let him go. No harm done.

41:58.180 --> 42:00.610
Are you sure, My Lord? Shouldn't
we shake out his pockets?

42:00.660 --> 42:02.330
I don't think so.

42:02.580 --> 42:05.820
He was more of a philosopher than a thief.

42:10.100 --> 42:14.540
- So your house is finished?
- Finished and ready to receive my guests.

42:14.620 --> 42:18.130
- And who'll run it day-to-day?
- My niece. My sister's girl.

42:18.180 --> 42:20.290
She's agreed, so I'm all set.

42:20.340 --> 42:22.290
Oh, and how will you attract the visitors?

42:22.340 --> 42:24.290
Put an advertisement in the papers.

42:24.340 --> 42:26.210
But how will they get in touch?

42:26.260 --> 42:27.810
How do you think?

42:27.860 --> 42:32.460
- I've installed a telephone in the house.
- Your own telephone?

42:32.540 --> 42:35.380
My, my. You're blazing a trail now.

42:36.340 --> 42:38.650
Have you found anyone
to hit with that yet?

42:38.700 --> 42:41.010
If I had my way, I'd hit the lot of them.

42:41.060 --> 42:44.420
- But it's going all right?
- (SIGHING) Well, it seems so.

42:44.540 --> 42:48.540
- Mr Carson, can I have a word?
- Certainly. - I'll leave you to it.

42:49.660 --> 42:51.730
It's something or nothing.

42:51.980 --> 42:54.380
Only, I'm a bit worried about Andy.

42:54.620 --> 42:57.820
Now, it may be innocent. I'm
not saying I'm infallible.

42:57.900 --> 43:01.380
But he's young, and you ought to know.

43:04.020 --> 43:06.290
Lady Grantham, how nice.

43:06.340 --> 43:09.050
Uh, this is my soon-to-be
daughter in law, Miss Cruikshank.

43:09.100 --> 43:12.930
She was curious to see the Abbey, so I
bought her here to support the opening.

43:12.980 --> 43:15.010
I've already taken her
to meet Mrs Crawley.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.970
What did your fiance say to that?

43:17.020 --> 43:20.020
Forgive me, but I think there's
been a misunderstanding.

43:20.100 --> 43:23.130
- Larry isn't Mrs Crawley's enemy. - No?

43:23.180 --> 43:25.290
He gives a marvellous impression of it.

43:25.340 --> 43:28.380
Please tell Mrs Crawley when you
see her that I am her friend.

43:28.460 --> 43:31.810
I would never want to stand in
her way. And nor will Larry.

43:31.860 --> 43:33.930
I promise. Not while I'm around.

43:33.980 --> 43:38.060
- Oh, yes, very interesting.
- Oh, interesting and encouraging.

43:38.140 --> 43:40.810
Yes, I'll leave it at interesting for now.

43:40.980 --> 43:42.850
Good day to you both.

43:44.260 --> 43:46.860
Mama, can I speak to you?

43:47.220 --> 43:48.900
No, you may not.

43:55.580 --> 43:57.850
- Is dinner finished?
- It is.

43:58.420 --> 44:01.010
They've had coffee taken up
to Her Ladyship's bedroom,

44:01.060 --> 44:03.200
so they don't want us there.

44:03.740 --> 44:06.260
(EXHALES HEAVILY) What a day.

44:07.780 --> 44:10.980
- I hope you've thrown away that letter.
- No, not yet.

44:11.740 --> 44:14.060
I think you should.

44:14.420 --> 44:17.690
- I don't know. I have to think.
- Think about what?

44:17.740 --> 44:20.170
Nothing that would interest you.

44:20.220 --> 44:22.290
You don't know what might interest me.

44:22.340 --> 44:25.820
Well, that's rather what I
want to talk about, Mr Barrow.

44:29.540 --> 44:31.650
Do you want us to leave
you to it, Mr Carson?

44:31.700 --> 44:33.570
If you wouldn't mind.

44:37.620 --> 44:39.810
I hope you're not planning
to hit me with that.

44:39.860 --> 44:43.900
No. But I will not beat about
the bush either, Mr Barrow.

44:44.660 --> 44:46.290
Someone has reported that you seem

44:46.340 --> 44:49.140
to have a private
understanding with Andrew.

44:49.300 --> 44:50.930
Not this again.

44:50.980 --> 44:53.690
I might not have given it
much mind, but I was upstairs

44:53.740 --> 44:56.450
last night quite late, and
I saw him leave your room.

44:56.500 --> 44:59.130
Mr Carson, how long do I have
to work in this house before

44:59.180 --> 45:01.490
- I am given any credit?
- That is all very well,

45:01.540 --> 45:03.530
but we are talking about
a vulnerable young man,

45:03.580 --> 45:06.450
- and I must look to his welfare.
- Yes. And if I were to give you

45:06.500 --> 45:09.740
my word of honour that nothing took
place of which you would disapprove?

45:09.820 --> 45:11.760
If I could just be sure.

45:12.820 --> 45:17.340
So my word is still not good enough,
Mr Carson, after so many years?

45:18.380 --> 45:20.180
I only wish it were.

45:33.460 --> 45:35.620
Golly, Moses. You astound me.

45:35.700 --> 45:39.050
- And all from the sale of tickets?
- It's a great deal of money.

45:39.100 --> 45:41.730
I don't suppose we could open
the house on a regular basis?

45:41.780 --> 45:43.690
- For charity, you mean?
- No, for us.

45:43.740 --> 45:48.060
The house costs money to run, and
at the moment, it doesn't raise a
penny for washing its own face.

45:48.140 --> 45:50.330
Tell me you're not being serious, Tom.

45:50.380 --> 45:55.130
To charge money so people can come and snoop
around our home? What a revolting suggestion.

45:55.180 --> 45:57.890
- It is rather a frightful idea.
- All right.

45:57.940 --> 46:02.450
There may come a day when we
simply can't ignore such a large
source of income at our fingertips.

46:02.500 --> 46:06.330
- Hopefully when I am dust.
- Still, Tom and Isobel were right.

46:06.380 --> 46:08.930
People are curious about
what it's like to live here.

46:08.980 --> 46:10.770
Which is sad in a way.

46:10.820 --> 46:14.650
- Why? - Because it means our way
of life is something strange,

46:14.700 --> 46:17.330
something to queue up
and buy a ticket to see,

46:17.380 --> 46:20.650
a museum exhibit, a fat
lady in the circus.

46:20.700 --> 46:23.850
Trust you to cast a pall of
doom over our successful day.

46:23.900 --> 46:26.450
I had a visitor, a child
who'd escaped his mother.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.250
He thought we were mad to live here

46:28.300 --> 46:32.220
- when we could be so comfy in a normal house.
- Oh, I refuse to listen.

46:32.300 --> 46:34.130
Downton Abbey is where
the Crawleys belong.

46:34.180 --> 46:36.250
I hope we'll stay as long as we can.

46:36.300 --> 46:40.570
- But I suppose we all realise it may not
last forever. - Oh, this is weakling talk.

46:40.620 --> 46:43.130
George and I are made of sterner
stuff than the lot of you.

46:43.180 --> 46:46.220
- That, I'm sure, is quite true.
- And we are not going anywhere.

47:02.380 --> 47:04.380
(SOBS)

47:09.660 --> 47:12.730
Henry Talbot has invited us
all to Brooklands next week.

47:12.780 --> 47:13.810
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

47:13.860 --> 47:16.290
I think they'll have to drag you out,

47:16.340 --> 47:20.210
as you break your fingernails
catching at the door case.

47:20.260 --> 47:23.290
- English language never lets you down.
- Oh, shut up!

47:23.340 --> 47:26.440
When I pass you I expect
to see you cheer and wave.

47:26.780 --> 47:28.980
Come on, God bless you, come on!
