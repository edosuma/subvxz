00:12.220 --> 00:13.430
All right!

00:13.513 --> 00:16.641
[Ron Howard] <i>Michael Bluth had been away</i>
<i>from his family for two months,</i>

00:16.725 --> 00:18.601
<i>and his life had never seemed better.</i>

00:18.685 --> 00:20.645
- [grunts]
- [man] Oh, head in the sand!

00:20.729 --> 00:24.691
[Ron] <i>While at a tech company famous</i>
<i>for providing access to any information,</i>

00:24.774 --> 00:26.151
<i>except for its own name,</i>

00:26.234 --> 00:28.737
<i>- he had found friends...</i>
- Jim.

00:29.362 --> 00:32.448
- Oh, nice return, Jim.
<i>- ...been retrained for the workplace...</i>

00:32.531 --> 00:34.659
It's just <i>one </i> space after a period?

00:34.743 --> 00:36.036
That's okay. Let's try it again.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.205
<i>...and was learning new skills every day.</i>

00:39.289 --> 00:40.540
Hi, sorry I'm late.

00:40.623 --> 00:41.624
- [man] How you doing?
<i>- Konnichiwa.</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:43.752
- So, is your family joining you?
- No.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.755
They will not be joining, um,
but, um, maybe just, uh,

00:46.838 --> 00:49.340
one of their kids can take a swing at me,
huh?

00:49.424 --> 00:53.303
[Ron] <i>While he believed</i>
<i>he had put his family behind him...</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:57.557
This class is geared more to self-defense
<i>for </i> the family, not...

00:57.640 --> 00:58.933
Not <i>from </i> the family.

00:59.017 --> 01:02.479
<i>- ...there were some unresolved issues.</i>
- I get that.

01:03.271 --> 01:04.897
Do you have family-on-family stuff?

01:06.316 --> 01:08.443
A few years ago,
I would have given you the same look.

01:08.526 --> 01:12.072
[Ron] <i>In those few years,</i>
<i>Michael's life had changed quite a bit.</i>

01:12.155 --> 01:14.991
<i>After borrowing money
from a flirtatious family friend...</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:17.494
- Just till I get on my feet.
<i>- ...whose vertigo made it hard</i>

01:17.577 --> 01:19.788
<i>for her to stay on her </i> own <i>feet,</i>

01:19.871 --> 01:22.832
<i>Michael finally started
his own housing business.</i>

01:23.416 --> 01:26.711
- The collapse of the housing market...
- [Ron] <i>At the worst possible time.</i>

01:26.795 --> 01:28.505
- That's not a great sign.
- [squawks]

01:28.588 --> 01:31.007
[Ron] <i>But Michael soon had</i>
<i>another business opportunity.</i>

01:31.091 --> 01:33.968
- [Michael] I'm a producer?
- Well, it's a movie about the family.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.805
Although, the heartbeat of this thing
is the father-son dynamic.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.390
- [Ron] <i>Which put Michael off the project.</i>
- I'm not able to do this.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.060
[Ron] <i>Until a chance run-in</i>
<i>with actress Rebel Alley...</i>

01:42.143 --> 01:44.854
- I'm sorry.
- Where's a producer when you need one?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.232
<i>- ...put him back on it.</i>
- I'm a movie producer!

01:47.315 --> 01:49.317
[Ron] <i>And having found</i>
<i>his new leading lady...</i>

01:49.400 --> 01:50.985
I could put your name in for something.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.238
<i>...who turned out to be
Ron Howard's daughter,</i>

01:53.571 --> 01:56.741
<i>Michael was soon acting
like a movie producer, too.</i>

01:57.200 --> 01:59.410
[Ron] <i>Michael's son was starting</i>
<i>a business</i>

01:59.494 --> 02:02.914
<i>after claiming to have invented
a new privacy software.</i>

02:02.997 --> 02:05.625
...software that's also anti-piracy?
You have a way of doing this?

02:05.708 --> 02:06.584
This could be huge.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.294
[Ron] <i>Not exactly. It did do this.</i>

02:09.377 --> 02:11.214
...of what programmers
call "hacker traps."

02:11.297 --> 02:13.633
- It's called Fakeblock.
- [Ron] <i>And word spread.</i>

02:13.716 --> 02:15.093
How does your software work?

02:15.176 --> 02:18.346
[Ron] <i>Garnering attention</i>
<i>from the same actress to whom</i>

02:18.429 --> 02:20.014
<i>- he gave a fake name.</i>
- George Mi... Harris.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.308
[Ron] <i>And soon,</i>
<i>George Michael was acting like a...</i>

02:22.392 --> 02:24.644
<i>well, a movie producer, too.</i>

02:26.354 --> 02:29.607
<i>She was raised by a different mother
than Ron's other kids.</i>

02:29.691 --> 02:31.651
<i>It's just a whole different thing
over there.</i>

02:31.734 --> 02:34.154
<i>Anyway, with Maeby
in charge of the business,</i>

02:34.237 --> 02:36.364
<i>George Michael soon found himself in debt.</i>

02:36.447 --> 02:37.991
Maeby, we can't afford this.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.784
And my software isn't even rea... dy.

02:39.868 --> 02:43.288
- [Ron] <i>He found one place to save money.</i>
- Maeby, you're fired!

02:43.371 --> 02:45.498
[Ron] <i>And though Michael was losing Rebel</i>

02:45.582 --> 02:49.210
<i>- to her mystery man, he got good news.</i>
- You're dating Rebel Alley?

02:49.294 --> 02:51.254
Do you know the other guy
that she's dating?

02:51.337 --> 02:52.714
No. I know it's over.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.007
She is dumping him.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.925
[Ron] <i>Which he promptly acted upon.</i>

02:56.009 --> 02:57.385
[Michael singing]

02:57.510 --> 03:01.097
[Ron] <i>But it wouldn't be long</i>
<i>before Michael discovered who George...</i>

03:01.181 --> 03:03.808
<i>- "Maharis" really was.</i>
- [bleeps]

03:03.892 --> 03:06.477
[Ron] <i>Something he kept to himself</i>
<i>when his son admitted...</i>

03:06.561 --> 03:07.979
- I think it might be over.
- Great.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.858
Pain... fades slowly.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.611
- [Ron] <i>But Michael knew...</i>
- Quickly.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.737
<i>...he'd have to end it.</i>

03:15.820 --> 03:18.406
Tell me about your girlfriend.
You're producing this movie...

03:18.489 --> 03:20.825
I think they're both over.
Wasn't meant to be.

03:21.242 --> 03:23.995
You owe my sister $700,000.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.873
[Ron] <i>This, combined with a threat</i>
<i>from Lucille 2's brother...</i>

03:26.956 --> 03:31.169
- You can't hide in a gorilla suit from me.
- [Ron] <i>That one'sÂ hard to explain.</i>

03:31.252 --> 03:34.297
<i>...sent Michael to a night of drinking
and a desperate proposal</i>

03:34.380 --> 03:37.217
<i>to get his $700,000 debt forgiven...</i>

03:37.300 --> 03:39.677
I'm gonna have sex with you, for money.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.472
<i>...that perhaps overestimated his value,
at least according</i>

03:42.555 --> 03:45.225
<i>to the latest
Balboa Bachelor Auction totals.</i>

03:49.270 --> 03:51.522
<i>And returning from a night with Lucille 2,</i>

03:51.606 --> 03:54.901
<i>which ended poorly,
Michael ran into a brother...</i>

03:54.984 --> 03:56.861
I went to see Lucille 2,
and I lost control.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.447
I did something
that I wish I could forget.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.492
<i>...who had also done something
he wanted Michael to forget.</i>

04:02.575 --> 04:04.118
- Was that wax?
- [Gob] <i>Put the mask on!</i>

04:04.202 --> 04:08.039
[Ron] <i>Which is how he ended up drugged</i>
<i>on the floor of the model home...</i>

04:08.122 --> 04:12.085
- It's easy to forget.
<i>- ...where he peacefully slept,</i>

04:12.168 --> 04:14.128
<i>deterring at least one badly needed buyer.</i>

04:14.212 --> 04:17.005
...some of the neighbors
are not to be desired. Oh!

04:17.089 --> 04:19.050
One got in.
You know, I have other properties...

04:19.132 --> 04:21.761
[Ron] <i>And missing a visit</i>
<i>from </i> Predator Entrapment <i>host</i>

04:21.844 --> 04:24.430
<i>John Beard, who had arrived to retrieve</i>

04:24.514 --> 04:26.724
<i>some hidden cameras, now that it looked</i>

04:26.808 --> 04:30.019
<i>like his predator hole
had been fished out.</i>

04:31.229 --> 04:33.022
<i>It would be another full night</i>

04:33.106 --> 04:38.152
<i>before Michael would come up with a way
to work off his $700,000 debt...</i>

04:38.236 --> 04:39.445
...repay you that loan.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.614
<i>...that he'd forgotten
he'd already come up with.</i>

04:43.324 --> 04:47.328
<i>It was the next call to the woman
he believed his son had broken up with...</i>

04:47.412 --> 04:51.207
The thing with the other guy,
we don't have to talk about that.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.209
[Ron] <i>...that Michael would most regret.</i>

04:53.293 --> 04:55.628
- Goodbye.
- [Ron] <i>But there would have to be</i>

04:55.712 --> 04:57.088
<i>one more conversation.</i>

04:57.171 --> 04:58.756
[George Michael] Who was that?

04:59.882 --> 05:00.800
No one.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.639
[Ron] <i>Michael Bluth left</i>
<i>for his date with Rebel,</i>

05:06.723 --> 05:09.809
<i>surprised to find people working on
what he thought was a holiday.</i>

05:09.892 --> 05:11.394
Boy, you guys don't miss a day.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.438
- [Ron] <i>Michael had missed two.</i>
- Yeah.

05:13.521 --> 05:16.691
- What, are you tenting the place?
- [laughs] Hey, Michael. Yeah.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.318
We're getting everything prepped.

05:18.401 --> 05:21.529
Not sure if Maeby's in there,
or Tobias, or something?

05:21.654 --> 05:22.947
Mind if we use the stairs?

05:23.031 --> 05:25.074
Gob said he heard something in the attic.

05:26.242 --> 05:27.535
Oh, yeah, uh, well...

05:28.745 --> 05:30.705
Hopefully, it's not my father. [chuckles]

05:30.788 --> 05:33.249
George Sr.! [laughs]

05:33.333 --> 05:35.626
Okay.
This bug guy really knows our family.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.629
[Ron] <i>Michael went to find the source</i>
<i>of the noise,</i>

05:38.713 --> 05:41.632
<i>and soon came across a reminder
of a simpler time,</i>

05:41.716 --> 05:44.802
<i>and his dream of taking his son
on a scuba diving trip.</i>

05:47.013 --> 05:50.141
<i>He'd started the boy young,
getting him trained in</i>

05:50.224 --> 05:51.976
<i>- underwater communication.</i>
- Underwater communication.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.353
"Are you okay?"

05:53.436 --> 05:55.104
- "Yes, I'm okay."
- Okay.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.773
I've wanted to ask you that underwater.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.775
[Ron] <i>But soon,</i>
<i>the sign language turned...</i>

05:58.858 --> 06:01.527
- [instructor] "Out of oxygen."
<i>- ...to more pressing threats.</i>

06:01.611 --> 06:03.780
Now, that's one
you're gonna need to know.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.656
- [Michael] Mm-hmm.
- [instructor] Who remembers

06:05.740 --> 06:07.658
- "shark"? Huh?
- [Michael] Shark, that's easy.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.161
- Yeah. Huh?
- [instructor] "Manta ray."

06:10.244 --> 06:12.497
But don't do that around the shark.
They eat them.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.458
- [chuckles]
- [instructor] You got "boat," "jellyfish,"

06:15.541 --> 06:18.461
"propeller," and "electric eel." Ouch!

06:18.544 --> 06:20.004
Okay. Let's hit the pool.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.925
[Ron] <i>Ironically, it was this final threat</i>
<i>that did young George Michael in.</i>

06:24.008 --> 06:25.468
- We put on our tanks and we...
- Oh.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.761
George Michael? George Michael?

06:26.844 --> 06:27.970
Hey, pal.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.599
- Here we go.
- [filtered breathing]

06:32.225 --> 06:34.268
[Ron] <i>Michael soon found reminders</i>

06:34.352 --> 06:36.062
<i>of other scuba attempts they've made.</i>

06:37.688 --> 06:39.524
- [Michael] Huh? That was great.
- Oh, yeah.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.150
[Michael] You really conquered the pool.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.152
I think you're ready for the ocean.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.696
Huh.
I thought we were going to the Reef.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.657
We are. It's in the ocean.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.909
I thought it was a restaurant
by the pool.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.412
Why did you think I said,
"Watch out for the crabs"?

06:52.495 --> 06:54.956
Why did you think I said,
"I always get a hamburger"?

06:55.039 --> 06:57.500
- I thought you were kidding.
- [both chuckle]

06:58.000 --> 07:00.837
Buddy? Hey. George Michael?
Oh, he's done it again.

07:01.963 --> 07:02.880
There it is.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.091
- Deep breath, buddy.
- [filtered breathing]

07:05.883 --> 07:08.219
[Ron] <i>And Michael found himself</i>
<i>caught off guard</i>

07:08.302 --> 07:10.179
<i>by the fact that his son had grown</i>

07:10.263 --> 07:11.764
<i>right out of his childhood.</i>

07:12.723 --> 07:15.143
<i>And by the brother
who had squeezed himself</i>

07:15.226 --> 07:16.394
<i>- right into it.</i>
- [screams]

07:16.477 --> 07:18.312
- Oh, God!
- [screaming]

07:19.647 --> 07:21.983
- Buster? Buster? Hey.
- [wheezing]

07:22.066 --> 07:25.695
[Ron] <i>Fortunately, this wasn't</i>
<i>Michael's first scuba scare... scare.</i>

07:25.778 --> 07:27.321
- [screams]
- Ah! Okay. Hey.

07:27.738 --> 07:28.906
Michael. Hi.

07:30.491 --> 07:33.536
Am I that much of a monster, Michael?
Even to you?

07:33.619 --> 07:35.872
No, not at all,
I just wasn't expecting, uh,

07:35.955 --> 07:39.250
you know, a man to be sitting
in a Scuba Jr.,

07:39.417 --> 07:41.252
leaping out at me
up in the attic, that's all.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.963
- [both chuckling]
- That's all.

07:44.046 --> 07:44.881
[whoops]

07:44.964 --> 07:46.716
I guess that is a little strange.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.011
- You should've seen your face.
- Yeah, yeah, well...

07:50.094 --> 07:51.345
You looked like a little girl.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.722
- Oh, God!
- [shouts]

07:54.682 --> 07:56.142
- [clears throat]
- Look at that.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.518
Got a new hand?

07:57.602 --> 07:58.769
No, I just took the skin off.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.396
- It's in the dryer.
- All right.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.941
- Buddy, you cannot be up here, okay?
- The tent thing, I know.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.235
I mean, thank God
I found some scuba equipment

08:06.319 --> 08:08.154
- because they are fumigating.
- [hand whirring]

08:08.237 --> 08:10.823
Yeah. The skin really muffles the sound
on that.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.576
There's another suit over there;
it's a smaller size, though.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.370
Uh... [stammers] That's my son's.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.247
- We never got a chance to use it.
- Oh.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.541
Probably too young
to be around the fumes.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.505
No, pal, we were gonna use
this scuba gear for scuba diving.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.756
- Mm.
- Underwater.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.050
- Not to hang out in a poison cloud.
- Mm...

08:29.425 --> 08:31.427
It's father-son bonding
we never got to do.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.221
- Aw.
- Put it on the long list of regrets.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.222
Well, I've had plenty of those
with Mom.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.725
- Have you?
- We used to want to play dress-up.

08:37.808 --> 08:41.020
Her as Jackie O., me as John-John...
But we... [chuckles]

08:41.102 --> 08:43.648
No, I guess we did get to do that
a couple of times.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.858
âª <i>Motherboy...</i> âª

08:45.942 --> 08:47.318
- I'm sure...
- That isn't a regret.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.195
- Yeah, no, it should be.
- Mm-hmm.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.447
So why are you here at the house?

08:51.906 --> 08:53.616
Ma said she asked you
to look after me.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.911
No. She actually didn't.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.913
And I <i>can't </i> look after you.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.623
And you cannot be here.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.834
You can't say I can't be here
and say you're not looking after me.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.503
Pick a lane, Michael!

09:05.586 --> 09:07.880
I can't believe she did that
without consideration

09:07.964 --> 09:09.423
for what's going on in my life.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.717
Hope I never do that to my own, uh...

09:12.468 --> 09:13.553
um...

09:14.512 --> 09:17.098
- Mom.
- Son.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.225
- Ah. Oh, right.
- Hope I never do that to my son.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.851
[Ron] <i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>in this moment</i>

09:20.935 --> 09:24.021
<i>that Michael realized
he couldn't date Rebel anymore.</i>

09:25.314 --> 09:28.067
Okay. Sorry.
I got my own problems I gotta deal with.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.819
[laughing] Well, I guess I'm a problem.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.154
- Now I'm a problem.
- No, you're not a problem.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.656
Little help? The tank's heavy...

09:33.739 --> 09:36.450
I gotcha.
Oh, you found the flippers, too, huh?

09:36.534 --> 09:38.578
- No, I don't need help.
- You don't? Or you do?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.788
- Oh, pick a lane, Michael.
- I'm trying to help.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.790
- Pick a lane, Buster.
- No, <i>you </i> pick a lane!

09:42.873 --> 09:44.584
- Come on. Ow, ow, ow.
- I picked a lane!

09:44.667 --> 09:46.586
- Release that.Â Release it!
- [yelling]

09:46.669 --> 09:48.921
[Ron] <i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>

09:49.005 --> 09:51.966
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

09:52.049 --> 09:53.217
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

09:59.807 --> 10:01.517
<i>It's...</i>

10:05.563 --> 10:09.734
<i>Michael arrived at Rebel Alley's apartment
determined to be honest and end things.</i>

10:09.817 --> 10:12.028
[chuckles] Hey. What are you doing here?

10:12.111 --> 10:14.071
[Ron] <i>And almost immediately</i>
<i>found himself</i>

10:14.155 --> 10:15.865
<i>helplessly doing the opposite.</i>

10:15.948 --> 10:17.950
I'm dating Rebel Alley.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.452
<i>I'm </i> dating Rebel Alley.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.002
- It's like we're identical...
- [Ron] <i>There are moments</i>

10:28.085 --> 10:29.795
<i>that are hard to take back.</i>

10:30.296 --> 10:33.257
<i>Moments that create too great a shift
in dynamics.</i>

10:33.341 --> 10:37.261
<i>An earthquake in a family that shatters
both members' notions of themselves.</i>

10:37.345 --> 10:39.972
- ...twin...
- [Ron] <i>Like when you punch your dad.</i>

10:48.314 --> 10:49.815
I was going to get out of it.

10:50.524 --> 10:54.528
[Ron] <i>And as they both began to absorb</i>
<i>the weight of what had just happened...</i>

10:54.862 --> 10:57.156
- Hey, I hope I didn't...
- It's forgotten.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.992
- [Ron] <i>...they acted as if they hadn't.</i>
- And, um, and you...

11:00.076 --> 11:02.995
- I mean, I hope that I...
- Oh, it's in the past.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.705
[sighs] I'll let you get back to it.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.624
Yes, great, thank you.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.418
Um, I was just leaving, actually.

11:09.794 --> 11:10.628
Yes. Me, too.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.255
I thought you...

11:14.131 --> 11:15.091
I am now.

11:15.966 --> 11:18.302
And was going to earlier. [chuckles]

11:23.140 --> 11:24.642
- Ciao.
<i>- Bella.</i>

11:25.851 --> 11:27.728
[Ron] <i>Michael returned to the penthouse,</i>

11:27.812 --> 11:30.314
<i>eager to downplay what had happened
with his son.</i>

11:30.398 --> 11:32.191
Otherwise,
I'll just assume that we're good.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.860
Okay. Are we good? [chuckles]
All right.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.238
[Ron] <i>Michael was equally eager</i>
<i>to avoid Lucille 2...</i>

11:37.321 --> 11:38.698
[woman] Goodbye, Missus.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.951
<i>...whom he believed to be
in her apartment...</i>

11:44.328 --> 11:47.123
Boy. It's like the Weimar Republic
in that place.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.792
<i>- ...when his phone finally rang.</i>
- [phone buzzing]

11:51.001 --> 11:53.462
Don't hang up, don't hang up,
don't hang up, don't hang up,

11:53.546 --> 11:55.339
don't hang up, don't hang up.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.216
Hey, I've been looking for you.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.592
[Lucille 2] <i>It's Lucille Austero.</i>

11:58.676 --> 12:00.636
<i>- I've been looking for you.</i>
- Oh, hey.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.263
Uh, Lucille, yeah, look...

12:02.346 --> 12:04.223
I... [stammers, sighs]
I called you before, um...

12:04.306 --> 12:07.101
I'm right across the, um, uh, street.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.478
Uh, or city. Street, really.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.689
Our city, um... the... uh...
but we keep

12:11.772 --> 12:13.399
- missing each other, uh...
<i>- ...checkbook...</i>

12:13.482 --> 12:15.359
Uh, I'd much rather do the checkbook.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.778
But I am driving away right now,

12:17.987 --> 12:20.740
so if you actually come out
onto your balcony,

12:20.823 --> 12:22.616
you might even be able to see me driving.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.243
In fact, I think I see you.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.120
Is that you? Can I see you?

12:28.205 --> 12:30.583
[Ron] <i>Michael couldn't be sure</i>
<i>that she </i> was <i>out on her deck.</i>

12:31.167 --> 12:32.835
[Michael reading note]

12:32.918 --> 12:36.714
[Ron] <i>While he had second thoughts</i>
<i>about writing... "Love you,"</i>

12:36.797 --> 12:39.216
<i>he couldn't risk her coming out that door.</i>

12:39.550 --> 12:40.718
[clicks tongue] Hi.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.803
- She still out?
- Uh, no, no.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.598
She's... she's, uh, she's still
in there, but I gotta...

12:46.140 --> 12:49.018
She's kind of obsessed with me,
so I gotta... go.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.145
- [Ron] <i>But she wasn't in there.</i>
- [knocking on door]

12:51.228 --> 12:54.565
<i>Because moments earlier,
a still very upset George Michael</i>

12:54.648 --> 12:58.110
<i>- called a cousin in that apartment.</i>
- [George Michael] <i>I'm sorry about that.</i>

12:58.194 --> 13:00.571
I'm done being George Maharis.
I need to talk to you.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.698
Look, this isn't a great time, okay?

13:02.782 --> 13:05.451
I'm doing a scrub-down.
Nobody can know I was here,

13:05.534 --> 13:07.453
having a little smooch with my boyfriend.

13:07.536 --> 13:11.624
[Ron] <i>A boyfriend she was briefly seen</i>
<i>at Lucille 2's apartment with.</i>

13:11.707 --> 13:14.043
<i>While she believed
that he was an undercover cop</i>

13:14.126 --> 13:15.920
<i>- posing as a teenager.</i>
- [Maeby] A seÃ±or?

13:16.420 --> 13:19.089
- I'm 17. Ha!
- [Ron] <i>He turned actually out...</i>

13:19.173 --> 13:22.176
...to be a teenager,
posing as an undercover cop,

13:22.384 --> 13:23.552
posing as a teenager.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.845
<i>It's hard to explain.</i>

13:24.929 --> 13:29.099
No, that actually happened to, like,
two of my neighbors at Sudden Valley.

13:29.183 --> 13:32.019
They're not putting me in Sudden Valley.
I'll tell you that much.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.230
That's why I'm here,
picking up anything I left behind

13:34.313 --> 13:35.940
that might be incriminating.

13:36.023 --> 13:40.194
You know? Just panties, leggings, corsets,

13:40.277 --> 13:43.239
<i>the sex knobs, and one of those
double-headed bondage things</i>

13:43.322 --> 13:44.740
<i>with the curly choke leash.</i>

13:44.824 --> 13:45.908
That's probably a landline.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.827
Ew, gross!

13:47.910 --> 13:50.037
- She put her ear on that?
<i>- I need to talk to you.</i>

13:50.120 --> 13:52.623
It's about my dad.
I'm pulling up to the penthouse

13:52.706 --> 13:53.833
to see if he's here, so...

13:53.916 --> 13:55.543
Wait, you're at the penthouse?
No, no.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.211
Don't come up.
This place is crawling with cops.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.587
<i>I'll meet you there in a second.</i>

13:58.671 --> 14:01.298
<i>I gotta figure out how to get out of here
without being noticed.</i>

14:01.382 --> 14:02.842
Okay, I'll meet you in the courtyard.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.301
- For my dog?
- [Maeby] Whoa!

14:05.344 --> 14:06.345
Wow.

14:06.804 --> 14:07.888
You really snuck in.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.516
Hey, you know
what might look cute on you,

14:10.599 --> 14:12.059
instead of that smock?

14:12.142 --> 14:14.353
Also, do you have any scissors?

14:14.436 --> 14:16.605
- [Ron] <i>And moments later...</i>
- [phone buzzing]

14:16.689 --> 14:18.315
[Michael] Don't hang up,

14:18.399 --> 14:19.692
- don't hang up...
- [Maeby] Okay.

14:19.775 --> 14:20.860
[Ron] <i>And soon, the cousins</i>

14:20.943 --> 14:23.153
<i>met up in the courtyard downstairs.</i>

14:24.321 --> 14:25.531
- [George Michael] Hey.
- Hey.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.993
- You were at Gangie's penthouse?
- Lucille 2.

14:29.743 --> 14:30.870
Wh...

14:30.953 --> 14:33.122
You drive her car.
How do you still not know who that is?

14:33.205 --> 14:34.206
I punched my dad.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.959
Wow. Uncle Michael?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.460
- Yeah.
- Wow.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.838
You're burning bridges all over the place.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.214
I don't know what to do.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.259
Well, for starters,
you could post it on <i>Dadfights.</i>

14:45.676 --> 14:46.552
Wait, that's a thing?

14:46.635 --> 14:49.138
It's just, like, a bunch of guys
punching their dads, or...?

14:49.221 --> 14:51.640
Yeah, well, you're supposed to say,
"Guess what, Dad,"

14:51.724 --> 14:53.142
but some dads were catching on,

14:53.225 --> 14:55.394
and they were just whaling on their kids.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.354
You can watch those clips
on <i>That'sWhatSon.</i>

14:58.022 --> 15:00.649
Well, my dad didn't hit me back,
which is even worse.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.152
Still, I mean,
he knew I was the other man.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.486
For God knows how long.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.323
It couldn't have been for long.
He didn't know when I told him.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.950
You told him I was dating Rebel?

15:10.492 --> 15:13.621
Well, technically, I said she was
dumping her boyfriend, but...

15:14.330 --> 15:16.290
Yeah. I was hopingÂ this would happen.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.794
- Hey, you had fired me. I was... bored.
- Mad.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.256
I guess I need to apologize
to him or something.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.884
Well, if he said it was nothing
and now you apologize,

15:26.967 --> 15:28.552
you're gonna make it something.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.306
I mean, what did Gangie always say?
"Forget, but never forgive."

15:33.265 --> 15:34.892
You think she meant to say it that way?

15:35.517 --> 15:36.977
- Yeah.
- Do you think "A friend in need

15:37.061 --> 15:39.480
is no friend indeed"
was also on purpose?

15:40.189 --> 15:42.399
What about "They should take
the rapists and murderers

15:42.483 --> 15:44.360
and put them all together
on an island...

15:44.443 --> 15:46.779
"...and the murderers can be raped,
the rapists can be murdered...

15:46.862 --> 15:49.114
[both] until you only have either
two rapists or

15:49.198 --> 15:50.366
- [Maeby] one murderer
- one raped murderer

15:50.449 --> 15:53.035
- [both] but who cares about him?"
- Oh, was it "one <i>raped </i> murderer"?

15:53.118 --> 15:54.161
I've heard her say both.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.705
I mean, in all likelihood,
the guy would be raped.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.916
I should call him and say I'm sorry.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.919
Look, if you apologize to him,
it's gonna make him feel horrible.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.087
[sighs]

16:03.170 --> 16:04.964
So I think you should do it.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.882
[phone buzzing]

16:06.966 --> 16:07.800
[grunts]

16:20.229 --> 16:22.272
[Ron] <i>And so,</i>
<i>Michael left anotherÂ message,</i>

16:22.356 --> 16:24.650
<i>careful not to make his son
feel horrible</i>

16:24.733 --> 16:26.402
<i>with an apology of his own.</i>

16:26.694 --> 16:28.404
I wanted to hit you back...

16:28.487 --> 16:30.531
Uh... sorry, um...

16:30.614 --> 16:33.033
[stammering] I wanted to make
one thing clear, um...

16:33.117 --> 16:37.830
She, uh... She does not know
that we are father/son.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.708
That I was your, uh, your father.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.334
Uh, that I <i>am </i> your father.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.295
Okay? I will not apologize for that.
[chuckling] Okay?

16:45.379 --> 16:46.422
Or anything, really.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.299
So, no pressure to call me back,

16:49.383 --> 16:52.928
but if you want, um,
you know, hit me back.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.264
Okay? Well... [chuckles]

16:55.347 --> 16:56.390
Again, sorry.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.392
Okay, bye.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.104
[Ron] <i>And while listening</i>
<i>to make sure the coast was clear,</i>

17:02.187 --> 17:04.815
<i>Michael noticed something
he'd missed before.</i>

17:07.983 --> 17:09.236
[knocking on door]

17:11.030 --> 17:12.031
Sorry to bother you.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.906
Apparently, Lucille Austero's missed
a couple of speaking engagements.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.076
We're trying to find her.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.579
She-She's not in there?
I thought I heard her in there.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.539
No, it must have been
her housekeeper.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.290
Nobody's seen her since Cinco.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.834
Isn't today Cinco?

17:23.915 --> 17:24.960
Today's the sixth.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.212
[Lucille 2 grunts]

17:27.377 --> 17:29.631
Huh. Well, I just talked
to her on the phone,

17:29.715 --> 17:31.300
so she's somewhere.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.219
- If you'll excuse me.
- You're Michael Bluth?

17:35.012 --> 17:37.347
- I am Michael Bluth.
- Did you write this note?

17:38.098 --> 17:40.017
Yeah, that's one of mine. Who are you?

17:40.184 --> 17:42.686
Uh, Newport Beach Police Department,
Lieutenant Toddler.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.314
Ah. Officer.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.441
- Yeah, hi. I was hoping you were a cop.
- Hi.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.569
- Always wanted to be a cop.
- Uh-huh.

17:50.652 --> 17:53.655
[stammering] But they just don't pay fair.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.823
I do okay.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.325
Hmm? Yeah, I'm sure you do.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.576
But, you know, you probably...

17:57.659 --> 18:00.370
you haven't had to pay for
a meal in years, though. Huh?

18:01.538 --> 18:03.916
I mean, I'm sure that you offer, yeah?

18:04.750 --> 18:06.460
Do you talk to Ms. Austero often?

18:06.543 --> 18:08.629
I do not. Not often, no.
I barely know her.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.964
Really? 'Cause it says
right here that you love her.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.510
It does, doesn't it? Yeah.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.096
You know... [mumbling]
"Sorry we keep... love..."

18:17.179 --> 18:18.931
It's the way that I say goodbye.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.641
- Hmm.
- Um...

18:20.724 --> 18:22.434
because you never know, um...

18:23.227 --> 18:24.812
if you're never gonna see someone again.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.147
You should know that.
You see people actually die.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.857
- I've seen one person die.
- Mm-hmm.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.235
A postman.
Uh, was not my favorite day of the year...

18:31.318 --> 18:32.736
[chuckles] ...to say the least.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.947
And he is the one that taught me

18:35.030 --> 18:37.825
<i>- about loving each other.</i>
- [postman] Love each other.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.160
I guess this isÂ sort of my way
of keeping him alive.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.203
[Ron] <i>No, it was not.</i>

18:41.286 --> 18:42.287
Is your mother here?

18:42.371 --> 18:45.082
My mother? No.
I'm-I'm all grown up, Toddler.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.334
Okay, 'cause my partner
was here yesterday,

18:47.417 --> 18:49.670
talked to someone who said
that she lived here.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.296
It was a woman with red hair.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.383
[Ron] <i>In fact, it was George Sr.</i>

18:55.217 --> 18:58.679
<i>Who, after discovering he had
almost no testosterone at all</i>

18:58.762 --> 19:01.056
<i>was frightened and confused</i>

19:01.140 --> 19:03.142
<i>and eager to hide from the world.</i>

19:04.017 --> 19:07.813
I don't allow men in my apartment
without my husband present.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.982
[Ron] <i>But George Sr. soon realized</i>

19:10.065 --> 19:11.567
<i>his impression of a woman</i>

19:11.650 --> 19:13.610
<i>wasn't going to win him any awards.</i>

19:14.278 --> 19:17.531
<i>So he took off in his trailer
for Mexico to forget</i>

19:17.614 --> 19:19.449
<i>- his shameful mistakes.</i>
- [sighs]

19:19.533 --> 19:21.743
[Ron] <i>His son Gob, meanwhile,</i>
<i>was also in Mexico.</i>

19:22.286 --> 19:23.162
[Gob] Hey, there.

19:23.245 --> 19:27.916
Friend of mine left me a note,
um... in my handwriting,

19:28.208 --> 19:30.669
and he said that you might be able
to set me up with the pill

19:30.752 --> 19:34.131
that makes the memories go away,
like a... like a shame-wow.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.967
[Ron] <i>A request he'd made over 500 times.</i>

19:37.426 --> 19:40.345
See, I did something
a little out of character. [chuckles]

19:40.721 --> 19:44.600
And, um, the window's kind of
closing in on, you know,

19:44.683 --> 19:46.810
before it lodges in the long-term, um...

19:47.936 --> 19:49.396
What do you call it? Um...

19:52.024 --> 19:53.066
What do you call it?

19:55.485 --> 19:56.528
Brains.

19:57.487 --> 19:58.822
Long-term brains.

20:00.365 --> 20:04.661
[Ron] <i>But the store vendor had seen Gob</i>
<i>more times than he was able to forget.</i>

20:05.454 --> 20:07.915
- Yeah, make a call. Yes, definitely...
<i>- PolicÃ­a.</i>

20:07.998 --> 20:09.708
Definitely check with Belicia.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.919
- [speaking Spanish]
- Wish her a Happy Five, by the way.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.504
You guys get that here
or is that just out in the States?

20:15.005 --> 20:15.964
Getting in on it.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.342
- Happy Five.
- Oh, thank you.

20:18.425 --> 20:21.553
- How's your Five treating you?
- Dad?

20:21.637 --> 20:23.222
[Ron] <i>That's when he ran into his father.</i>

20:23.305 --> 20:25.474
Gob. Gob.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.434
What are you doing here?

20:28.602 --> 20:31.104
Here? I'm just getting some boner pills...

20:31.188 --> 20:33.398
[laughing] ...and this guys says
I don't need them.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.567
He knows from boner...
Anyway, what are you doing here?

20:35.651 --> 20:37.277
Me, too, I don't need 'em.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.404
[Ron] <i>And then Gob had an idea.</i>

20:39.780 --> 20:41.698
What do you say you and I...

20:41.782 --> 20:42.991
[Ron] <i>A horrible idea.</i>

20:43.075 --> 20:45.327
...[bleeps] our way through Mexico?

20:45.619 --> 20:46.912
[Ron] <i>This wouldn't be an option</i>

20:46.995 --> 20:49.790
<i>for George Sr., which is why he replied...</i>

20:49.998 --> 20:52.209
Mexico won't be able to walk for a week.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.877
[laughs]

20:53.961 --> 20:55.295
Two full weeks!

20:56.922 --> 20:59.549
- [Ron] <i>Michael knew none of this.</i>
- [Michael] <i>That's impossible.</i>

20:59.633 --> 21:00.884
My mother's got brown hair.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.511
You don't know anyone with red hair?

21:02.594 --> 21:05.889
No, I don't know anyone...
Well, I know...

21:06.139 --> 21:07.683
I'm just ending something right now

21:07.766 --> 21:09.559
with a woman who has red hair,
Rebel Alley.

21:09.643 --> 21:10.852
Oh, Ron Howard's daughter.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.562
That's the one. And Ron's got red hair.

21:12.646 --> 21:15.482
So, I guess that's two people
I know with red hair.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.862
Of course, I'm holding a wig
that is made of red hair.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.700
So that's those two and the wig,
I think that's got it.

21:24.783 --> 21:28.203
And my sister has recently
gotten the red hair.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.663
But she's nuts, so...

21:29.746 --> 21:32.082
[Ron] <i>Actually, Lindsay</i>
<i>had been hiding her identity</i>

21:32.165 --> 21:35.252
<i>with that very wig while dating
a right-wing candidate</i>

21:35.335 --> 21:37.004
<i>whose positions she opposed...</i>

21:37.087 --> 21:37.921
I can't do this

21:38.005 --> 21:40.507
unless you promise to be against the wall.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.800
What the hell?

21:41.883 --> 21:43.218
<i>...and was determined to change.</i>

21:43.302 --> 21:44.970
- Better for my back, anyway.
- Thank you.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.806
[Ron] <i>But soon, photos of Herbert Love</i>
<i>with a mystery redhead</i>

21:47.889 --> 21:49.516
<i>were used to blackmail her.</i>

21:50.100 --> 21:51.560
- God, that was a photo booth?
- Mm-hmm.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.229
[Ron] <i>So, it was only once</i>
<i>she ditched the red hair...</i>

21:54.313 --> 21:56.481
I'm a Bluth and so are you.

21:56.565 --> 22:00.068
<i>- ...that she joined the opposition.</i>
- [chanting] Put up this wall!

22:00.152 --> 22:02.321
[Ron] <i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>her candidate encountered</i>

22:02.404 --> 22:03.530
<i>some new opposition.</i>

22:03.655 --> 22:04.990
- [yells]
- [officer] <i>We have an unconscious</i>

22:05.073 --> 22:06.366
black male choosing not to comply.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.243
[Ron] <i>Having discovered</i>
<i>he dropped out of the race...</i>

22:08.327 --> 22:09.745
[officer] Aggressively come at me!

22:10.162 --> 22:12.831
<i>...Lindsay's political enthusiasm waned.</i>

22:13.790 --> 22:16.001
[Michael] <i>So, I have no idea where she is,</i>

22:16.084 --> 22:18.670
but, uh, my mother is at Austerity.
It's a rehab clinic.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.673
Actually, we checked the rehab
and your mother wasn't there.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.009
[Ron] <i>Actually, when Lucille 2</i>
<i>first went missing,</i>

22:24.092 --> 22:27.596
<i>Lucille 1 took the opportunity
to compel her therapist</i>

22:27.679 --> 22:31.433
<i>to change her status
from in-to outpatient,</i>

22:31.516 --> 22:34.269
<i>bypassing both
the Austerity Clinic's red tape</i>

22:34.936 --> 22:36.772
<i>as well as its security tape.</i>

22:40.025 --> 22:43.904
And she was remanded to the care
of your brother-in-law, Tobias Funghi?

22:43.987 --> 22:45.739
- F...
- You don't happen to know

22:45.822 --> 22:48.200
the license plate of the car he drives,
do you?

22:48.283 --> 22:49.826
His license plate number? No, I don't.

22:49.910 --> 22:53.246
I barely know my own license plate number,
much less my brother-in...

22:53.997 --> 22:57.918
It's A-N-U-S
and then for some reason T-A-R-T.

22:58.668 --> 22:59.711
"A new start."

23:00.837 --> 23:03.215
If you saw it written out,
I don't think that you would...

23:03.298 --> 23:07.052
Let me try this one on you.
A-N-A-L-R-A-P...

23:07.135 --> 23:09.221
Well, it doesn't matter.
Listen, I gotta go.

23:09.304 --> 23:12.224
I don't know where my mother
and Tobias are, excuse me,

23:12.307 --> 23:13.809
but they're clearly up to something.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.560
They're not gonna be easy to get back.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.355
Well, Ms. Austero isn't quite
a missing person yet.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.566
We are particularly interested
in talking to Byron,

23:21.650 --> 23:23.443
who she apparently
had a relationship with.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.822
It's Buster. Uh, and that's why I know
that they're up to something,

23:26.905 --> 23:29.991
'cause the last time
that I saw Buster was, um...

23:30.075 --> 23:31.493
- Oh, God!
- [yells]

23:31.576 --> 23:33.954
[Ron] <i>And, resentful of his family,</i>

23:34.037 --> 23:36.498
<i>Michael came up with a plan
to make them come back.</i>

23:36.581 --> 23:38.166
Tell me how
this missing person thing works.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.669
- You want to report him missing?
- I might.

23:40.752 --> 23:44.464
You'd call it in,
but not until he's been gone for 72 hours.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.800
Hmm. I think it's worth the wait.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.510
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.221
That's what we'll do.
Find Buster, you're gonna find Lucille.

23:51.304 --> 23:52.347
Which one?

23:52.431 --> 23:53.598
I don't think he cares.

23:55.350 --> 23:56.393
See you later.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.771
Thank you for your service.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.191
Love you.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.776
[elevator bell dings]

24:09.448 --> 24:13.577
[Ron] <i>Lindsay arrives at the border</i>
<i>she had just called for a wall to protect.</i>

24:13.660 --> 24:15.287
[Lindsay] Oh, they have one.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.582
[laughs nervously]

24:18.665 --> 24:20.542
[speaking Spanish]

24:20.625 --> 24:21.877
He wants your passport.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.879
Oh, I didn't bring a... [scoffs]
I'm American.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.630
How do you say "I'm American"
in Mexican?

24:25.714 --> 24:26.965
<i>Soy americano.</i>

24:27.048 --> 24:30.135
Hmm. That does sound good.
Ask him for two.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.471
[Ron] <i>Lindsay is proud</i>

24:32.554 --> 24:34.556
<i>that she thought to include her driver.</i>

24:36.349 --> 24:38.560
<i>And Lucille and her therapist arrive</i>

24:38.643 --> 24:40.854
<i>- at their beachside </i> casita.
- [Lucille] Look at them.

24:40.937 --> 24:43.690
Dancing on the beach
like they own the place.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.110
Good. We'll use that.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.196
I want to laser in on that anger.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.697
Look out at the ocean.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.783
Tell me, what does it make you think?

24:54.367 --> 24:57.537
Like, "Everyone's having fun but me,

24:57.621 --> 25:00.081
running and laughing and...

25:00.165 --> 25:02.042
I feel like men run away from me.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.920
- I'm stuck here doing therapy."
- I've been deserted.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.881
Is that my fault?
Is it because of my anger?

25:08.965 --> 25:11.843
When I see a squirrelly,
little fruitcake like that one

25:11.927 --> 25:14.012
skipping into the ocean, I think,

25:14.095 --> 25:17.891
- "Why do I hate him so much?"
- [man laughing outside]

25:17.974 --> 25:20.602
That little bald one there
with the fringed cut-offs who...

25:20.685 --> 25:22.729
- [Tobias] Yay!
- [Lucille] Oh, [bleeps].

25:22.812 --> 25:23.939
It's you.
