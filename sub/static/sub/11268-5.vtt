        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:04.571 --> 00:07.806
Woody, could we have            
some more pretzels, please?     

00:09.175 --> 00:10.843
                     Woody?     

00:12.012 --> 00:13.445
     Oh, sorry, Dr. Crane.      

00:13.513 --> 00:16.047
    I... I was just thinking    
 about how big the universe is. 

00:17.117 --> 00:18.283
              Yes, it is, Woody.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.351
            As a matter of fact,

00:19.419 --> 00:20.519
                  it's expanding
                all the time.   

00:20.587 --> 00:22.521
     Spiraling outward,         
     ad infinitum,              

00:22.589 --> 00:23.922
     from the center            
     of its origin              

00:23.990 --> 00:26.692
     at an alarming             
     seven miles per second.    

00:26.760 --> 00:30.262
    You mean all of us          
      are getting bigger?       

00:31.798 --> 00:33.766
          Well, no, Woody, we...
            we're not expanding.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.000
                The universe is.

00:35.068 --> 00:36.802
Although some of us             
could stand to eat              

00:36.870 --> 00:38.737
a few less                      
jelly doughnuts.                

00:40.807 --> 00:43.876
  So, as the universe expands,  
      what happens to us?       

00:43.943 --> 00:46.178
                Well, someday   
              we'll just explode

00:46.246 --> 00:47.880
         into billions of atoms,

00:47.947 --> 00:49.715
        which themselves will   
         cease to exist in time.

00:49.816 --> 00:51.750
Why, in ten                     
quadrillion years,              

00:51.851 --> 00:54.887
             there'll be nothing
            left of anything.   

00:54.954 --> 00:57.690
May I have                      
those pretzels now, Woody?      

00:59.793 --> 01:02.961
     Sure, better get them      
         while you can.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.772
 Good morning, unwashed masses. 

02:19.839 --> 02:21.840
            Hey, hey, a new suit
            there, huh, Cliffie?

02:21.908 --> 02:23.108
        Oh, yeah, yeah.         
            Like it?            

02:23.209 --> 02:25.911
Shiny as the penny              
you spent on it.                

02:29.983 --> 02:31.550
Oh, no, sorry, ma'am.           

02:31.618 --> 02:34.353
No open flames                  
near this suit.                 

02:37.791 --> 02:39.124
        So, uh,...              

02:39.192 --> 02:40.793
        what's the              
        occasion, Cliff?        

02:40.860 --> 02:41.794
      My girlfriend,            
        Margaret.               

02:41.861 --> 02:43.295
    Just picked her up          
        at the airport,         

02:43.363 --> 02:44.630
        dropped her off         
         at the hotel.          

02:44.698 --> 02:46.632
                    She'll be by
            in a few minutes.   
All right!                      

02:46.700 --> 02:48.434
                 Margaret's back
                    from Canada.

02:48.535 --> 02:49.868
Yeah, yeah.                     
She just couldn't take          

02:50.003 --> 02:51.370
those brutal                    
freezing winters                

02:51.438 --> 02:52.471
those sub-zero                  
temperatures,                   

02:52.572 --> 02:54.540
the lonely sense                
of isolation,                   

02:54.607 --> 02:56.475
so she's, uh, coming            
back to me.                     

02:56.543 --> 02:58.944
     Yeah? Well, the grass      
    is always greener.          

02:59.012 --> 03:00.412
                      (chuckles)

03:00.480 --> 03:02.348
Hey, Cliffie,                   
do we, uh, hear...              

03:02.415 --> 03:05.117
    (glasses jingling)          
wedding bells?                  
                        Ah.     

03:05.185 --> 03:06.285
                (chuckling)     

03:06.386 --> 03:08.887
Not for this <i>muchacho,</i>          
there, Sammy.                   

03:08.955 --> 03:11.090
  What are you talking about?   
  I thought you always wanted   
        to get married.         

03:11.157 --> 03:13.625
No, no, no, no.                 
No time soon, that's for sure.  

03:13.693 --> 03:17.563
Hey, there's still a lot of     
postage left on this U.S. male. 

03:20.834 --> 03:22.501
          Yeah, well, the only  
        real hurdle left is Ma. 

03:22.569 --> 03:23.602
                        Yeah?   

03:23.670 --> 03:25.304
        Oh, yeah, yeah.         
      It's very traumatic       

03:25.372 --> 03:27.373
    when the woman you love     
    more than anything else     

03:27.440 --> 03:29.174
    in the world meets          
    your significant other.     

03:29.242 --> 03:31.643
                  Which would be
                which, Cliff?   

03:31.711 --> 03:36.015
Well, now you see               
my problem.                     

03:36.116 --> 03:38.917
So, uh, what'd your ma say      
    when you told her?          

03:38.985 --> 03:40.853
Well, I'm gonna break it        
to her this afternoon.          

03:40.920 --> 03:42.654
See, I came up                  
with this great idea.           

03:42.722 --> 03:44.390
I'm gonna tell her              
in a public place               

03:44.457 --> 03:46.125
where I'm surrounded            
by my friends, you see?         

03:46.192 --> 03:47.626
Then she'll have                
to control herself              

03:47.694 --> 03:49.361
and she won't embarrass me.     

03:49.429 --> 03:51.330
        Clifford,               

03:51.398 --> 03:55.801
 for the hundredth time, if you 
want to use my shower cap       

03:55.869 --> 03:59.872
in the morning, will you put it 
    back where you found it?    

03:59.973 --> 04:02.141
Perhaps as a reminder,          

04:02.208 --> 04:05.310
you'd like to wear it           
for the rest of the day?        

04:08.815 --> 04:11.250
              You know, suddenly
                     I see Cliff

04:11.317 --> 04:13.886
                as heroically   
                  well-adjusted.

04:13.953 --> 04:17.690
    Sam, I was a little off     
          on payroll,           

04:17.757 --> 04:20.492
    so I just made up           
a bunch of numbers and...       

04:20.560 --> 04:22.861
What are you doing?             
You're drinking coffee.         

04:22.929 --> 04:24.129
                 Yeah. So?      

04:24.297 --> 04:25.230
You can't drink coffee          

04:25.298 --> 04:26.365
when we're trying               
to make a baby.                 

04:26.466 --> 04:27.399
                I don't know.   

04:27.467 --> 04:28.500
         I'm pretty coordinated.

04:34.574 --> 04:35.941
Sam, that's not the point.      

04:36.009 --> 04:38.210
You were supposed to stay       
in peak physical condition.     

04:38.278 --> 04:40.012
You know, caffeine loading      
could be the reason             

04:40.080 --> 04:42.381
why we haven't been             
able to conceive for            
the last two months.            

04:42.449 --> 04:44.350
              Come on. It's just
                a cup of coffee.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.251
No, Sam, you have               
to promise me something.        

04:46.353 --> 04:48.487
Till I am pregnant,             
you have to stay                
in better shape.                

04:48.555 --> 04:50.055
You have to stop                
drinking coffee,                

04:50.123 --> 04:51.523
stop eating junk food           

04:51.591 --> 04:53.692
             and stop staying up
        late watching movies.   

04:53.760 --> 04:55.227
Why don't you just kill the man?

04:56.930 --> 04:58.897
    All right,                  
    all right,                  
    all right.                  

04:58.965 --> 05:00.499
If you really think             
this is important,              

05:00.567 --> 05:01.900
I'll, uh, I'll stop             
drinking coffee.                

05:01.968 --> 05:03.335
                All right, good.
            I mean, we only have

05:03.436 --> 05:05.104
                two days left   
                  in this month.

05:05.171 --> 05:06.705
What do you mean?               

05:06.773 --> 05:08.741
              Well, you see here
                on the calendar,

05:08.808 --> 05:11.744
                I, I put a B for
                baby on the days

05:11.811 --> 05:13.078
                 when I'm likely
                    to conceive.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.414
         You know, the days when
            we should make love.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.116
That's funny.                   
I usually put an F.             

05:17.217 --> 05:20.019
                    F?          

05:20.086 --> 05:21.587
    For "fertile."              

05:21.654 --> 05:23.355
What did you                    
think I meant?                  

05:23.423 --> 05:25.557
You know...                     

05:25.625 --> 05:28.594
I'm, I'm not so sure            
I want you to carry my baby.    

05:31.331 --> 05:33.966
                So, you see, the
                entire region   

05:34.034 --> 05:36.602
        might more accurately   
                    be described

05:36.670 --> 05:39.571
                 as "The Bermuda
                    Rhombus".   

05:41.474 --> 05:43.709
Well, thanks, Ma.               
                         Mm-hmm.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.712
Look, Ma, there's something     
I think we'd better talk about, 

05:46.780 --> 05:49.148
and, uh, I'm not so sure        
you want to hear it.            

05:49.249 --> 05:52.117
Well, what the heck,            
here goes.                      

05:52.185 --> 05:54.186
I, uh, I met somebody.          

05:54.254 --> 05:56.488
Yeah, actually,                 
more than a somebody.           

05:56.556 --> 05:57.823
It's a woman.                   

05:57.891 --> 06:00.526
        This isn't like the time
          you had your heart set

06:00.593 --> 06:02.828
                    on Priscilla
                 Presley, is it?

06:02.896 --> 06:05.497
No, no, Ma.                     

06:05.565 --> 06:07.966
This is more than a few         
hundred silly letters.          

06:10.837 --> 06:14.640
I, uh, I actually               
know this gal.                  

06:14.708 --> 06:17.009
Yeah, see, her name             
is Margaret.                    

06:17.077 --> 06:18.110
She's from Canada.              

06:18.178 --> 06:21.980
I love her,                     
and she loves me.               

06:22.048 --> 06:25.651
             Oh... I understand,
                    Clifford.   

06:25.719 --> 06:27.686
            If this is the woman

06:27.754 --> 06:31.090
                you've chosen to
                take my place...

06:31.157 --> 06:34.827
          I guess the only thing
            for me to do is die.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.433
Ma, what are you doing?         

06:41.501 --> 06:44.269
                      I'm dying.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.938
You're not dying.               

06:46.006 --> 06:47.306
Will you stop it?               
Come on.                        

06:47.374 --> 06:50.142
        No need to take me to   
        the graveyard, Clifford.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.678
                Just set me next
                to your tubby   
                friend there.   

06:54.748 --> 06:57.383
                      And when I
                 start to bloat,

06:57.450 --> 06:59.518
                    just toss me
                in the Dumpster.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.820
Thanks for bringing your ma by. 

07:05.625 --> 07:08.127
                    It's the way
                I want to go,   

07:08.194 --> 07:10.896
 alone in a bar without my son. 

07:10.964 --> 07:14.600
Anyone who is blood-type O      
    is welcome to my organs.    

07:14.668 --> 07:16.802
  I don't recommend the heart.  

07:16.870 --> 07:17.970
    It's been broken.           

07:19.873 --> 07:21.774
     What's that, Grandma?      

07:21.841 --> 07:23.475
     Come toward the light?     

07:23.543 --> 07:25.377
                             Ma!

07:27.681 --> 07:29.548
        Ma, you're not dying.   

07:29.616 --> 07:31.850
                    Now stop it!
(door opens)                    

07:31.918 --> 07:34.453
                          CLIFF:
                  Oh, now here's
                Margaret now.   

07:34.521 --> 07:36.121
          So, let's go meet her,
        and then now, please,   

07:36.189 --> 07:37.723
        just behave yourself,   
                will you, Ma?   

07:39.125 --> 07:42.027
I'll put off dying just         
long enough to meet her.        

07:44.564 --> 07:46.598
             This is turning out
         better than I expected.

07:51.671 --> 07:52.971
     Ma, this is Margaret.      

07:54.474 --> 07:57.142
     Margaret, this is Ma.      

07:59.779 --> 08:00.979
    Hello.                      

08:01.047 --> 08:02.548
            Hello.              

08:06.119 --> 08:08.620
          Well, enough          
     of this chitchat, huh?     

08:08.688 --> 08:11.657
     Listen, I've got some,     
uh, lunch reservations up there 

08:11.725 --> 08:13.325
at Melville's for, uh, me       
          and my gals.          

08:13.393 --> 08:14.360
        What do you say?        

08:14.427 --> 08:15.861
    Oh, I get to have lunch,    

08:15.929 --> 08:18.764
    and then it's off           
        to the ice floe.        

08:18.832 --> 08:21.333
Oh, you must                    
be referring                    
to the custom                   

08:21.401 --> 08:24.336
of the Inuit people, where      
they set their golden-agers     

08:24.404 --> 08:25.838
on an ice floe to die.          

08:25.905 --> 08:27.706
                     How did you
                      know that?

08:27.774 --> 08:29.842
Oh, I love trivia.              

08:29.909 --> 08:32.010
                    Good answer.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.246
        Yeah, well, uh,         
      shall we go, ladies?      

08:34.313 --> 08:35.547
                        Mm.     

08:35.615 --> 08:37.816
Command of trivia               
is one of the things            

08:37.884 --> 08:39.585
that attracted me               
to Cliff.                       

08:39.652 --> 08:42.020
Uh, that and his manners.       

08:42.087 --> 08:43.789
                Good heavens.   
                    His what?   

08:43.857 --> 08:45.524
    His manners.                

08:45.592 --> 08:48.594
          Oh, my dear, I thought
        you said his manhood.   

08:48.661 --> 08:49.595
                (laughs)        

09:02.275 --> 09:04.543
        Sam, I...               

09:04.611 --> 09:06.311
 Are you drinking coffee again? 

09:06.379 --> 09:08.914
 No. No, no, this is for Norm.  

09:09.916 --> 09:11.784
                  (coughs)      

09:22.696 --> 09:23.862
I think I figured out           

09:23.930 --> 09:25.497
why you haven't been able       
to give me a baby.              

09:25.565 --> 09:27.299
            What makes you think
            it's <i>my</i> fault?      

09:27.367 --> 09:28.701
     Well, I've been doing      
         some reading,          

09:28.768 --> 09:30.703
    and I think I know          
      what the problem is.      

09:30.770 --> 09:32.004
    You wear bikini briefs,     
        don't you?              

09:32.072 --> 09:34.506
          Sweetheart, I know the
         lights are usually out,

09:34.574 --> 09:36.075
          but I do take 'em off.

09:38.611 --> 09:39.978
Sam, look. Look--               

09:40.046 --> 09:42.281
according to this brochure,     
briefs are bad for you.         

09:42.349 --> 09:44.783
They're constricting, they      
raise your body temperature,    

09:44.851 --> 09:48.620
sometimes rendering your        
little swimmers ineffectual.    

09:48.688 --> 09:50.189
Look at the little cartoon.     

09:50.256 --> 09:52.358
                    Oh, gee!    

09:52.425 --> 09:53.692
Sam, the bottom line is,        

09:53.760 --> 09:55.361
we have to lower                
the temperature down there.     

09:55.428 --> 09:56.829
                Well, how are we
                  gonna do that?

09:56.896 --> 10:02.468
With these underpants lined     
with freon-based gel.           

10:05.271 --> 10:08.507
             You want me to wear
            frozen underwear?   

10:09.943 --> 10:11.243
        I, I'll freeze my....   

10:11.311 --> 10:13.178
Exactly.                        

10:18.084 --> 10:21.720
Oh, I haven't looked            
at these in ages.               

10:21.788 --> 10:22.855
                 MARGARET:      
            Is that Cliff?      

10:22.922 --> 10:23.856
        Oh, my, no.             

10:23.923 --> 10:25.090
That's Clifford's father.       

10:25.158 --> 10:27.259
You see where Clifford          
got his wide bottom.            

10:27.327 --> 10:29.895
          Mm. I've always       
             wondered.          

10:29.963 --> 10:32.064
When Clifford was a baby,       

10:32.132 --> 10:35.868
we'd set him down               
and gently push him over.       

10:35.935 --> 10:38.203
And wouldn't you know,          
he'd pop right back up          

10:38.271 --> 10:41.206
just like, just like one        
of those inflatable clowns!     

10:41.274 --> 10:42.374
                        (laughs)

10:42.442 --> 10:45.511
             Well, come on, sit,
            sit, sit, please.   

10:45.578 --> 10:47.346
            Bartender, how about
              a couple of drinks

10:47.414 --> 10:48.881
            for my lovely       
             ladies here, huh?  

10:48.948 --> 10:51.383
In the meanwhile, I'll go       
and, uh, use the facilities.    

10:51.451 --> 10:54.019
Clifford,                       
don't be vulgar.                

10:55.822 --> 10:57.423
    Sorry, Ma.                  

10:58.825 --> 11:00.759
        So, Cliff,              
     how'd it go upstairs?      

11:00.827 --> 11:02.094
                      Oh, great.
                  They got along

11:02.162 --> 11:03.595
                like, uh, two   
              long-lost friends.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.199
              All through lunch,
                it was just yak,
                  yak, yak, yak.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.901
                  Couple of real
              chatterboxes, huh?

11:08.968 --> 11:12.838
     Uh, no. Ma just knows      
  a lot of trivia about yaks.   

11:15.308 --> 11:18.210
                  Shall I make a
        general announcement?   

11:18.278 --> 11:20.045
Oh, well, shouldn't             
we wait for Cliff               

11:20.113 --> 11:21.413
to get back                     
from the restroom?              

11:21.481 --> 11:22.648
        Oh, let's not hurry him.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.650
          That's his alone time.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.353
     (spoon rapping glass)      

11:27.587 --> 11:28.787
            ESTHER:             
        Everybody,              

11:28.855 --> 11:30.656
 I have an announcement to make.

11:30.724 --> 11:36.195
     This beautiful, young lady,
     Margaret Catherine O'Keefe,

11:36.262 --> 11:40.232
            has agreed to become
             my daughter-in-law.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.039
     Hey, what's going on?      

11:47.107 --> 11:49.274
              Why, your wedding,
                    Clifford.   

11:49.342 --> 11:52.211
            Uh, beg your pardon?

11:52.278 --> 11:53.946
Isn't this great?!              

11:54.014 --> 11:56.148
        I'm going to be         
     the next Mrs. Clavin!      

11:58.351 --> 12:02.988
  He has the same look he had   
  when he took me to the prom.  

12:13.433 --> 12:14.800
            Don't say no.       

12:14.868 --> 12:17.803
        I want to buy you       
             a mobile home.     

12:17.871 --> 12:21.440
            Now, I can't afford 
              the deluxe model  

12:21.508 --> 12:22.775
            with the front      
            porch, so...        

12:22.842 --> 12:23.842
Oh, well,                       
that's okay.                    

12:23.910 --> 12:25.611
We'll make it home.             

12:25.679 --> 12:26.945
I'm awfully handy.              

12:27.013 --> 12:28.414
I... I can make                 
a nice gravel garden,           

12:28.481 --> 12:31.116
and we can buy one              
of those concrete gnomes.       

12:31.184 --> 12:33.652
  You're already getting one.   

12:38.091 --> 12:40.759
Oh, this is                     
so exciting!                    

12:40.827 --> 12:42.127
I'm about                       
ready to burst.                 

12:42.195 --> 12:43.829
I have to go                    
call my parents.                
          Yeah. Yeah.           

12:45.198 --> 12:47.499
             And, with any luck,
         by this time next year,

12:47.567 --> 12:49.234
             we're going to hear
            the pitter-patter   

12:49.302 --> 12:52.204
          of little Clavin feet.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.707
        Woody... Woody,         
    hold this for me.           

12:54.774 --> 12:56.041
    Hold this knife.            

12:57.110 --> 12:58.510
    Lower.                      

12:59.979 --> 13:01.146
    (yelling)                   

13:01.214 --> 13:02.548
              Ah!               

13:07.887 --> 13:11.357
     Ma, you know, this is      
     all happening so fast.     

13:11.424 --> 13:13.225
    I mean, here I am           
    going to marry Margaret,    

13:13.293 --> 13:15.728
I don't even remember proposing.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.763
                No. If we waited
             for you to propose,

13:17.831 --> 13:19.465
                    I'd never be
                  a grandmother.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.567
What are you talking about?     

13:21.634 --> 13:25.304
                 Oh, dear. I was
                 afraid of this.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.006
             I think we'd better
             have a little talk.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.642
                        Woody!  

13:30.710 --> 13:33.512
            Two whiskeys, and   
            leave the bottle.   

13:36.950 --> 13:38.217
     Now, I don't want you      
            to think            

13:38.418 --> 13:40.185
    that I'm looking forward    
            to this             

13:40.253 --> 13:41.854
      but with your father      
     out of the picture...      

13:41.921 --> 13:43.322
            (breathes deeply)   

13:43.390 --> 13:45.424
    ...it's one of those crosses
      I'm going to have to bear,

13:45.492 --> 13:46.959
         along with many others.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.727
ESTHER:                         
Now, when                       

13:48.795 --> 13:52.331
            a man and woman love
        each other very much,   

13:52.399 --> 13:58.270
    they share a very special   
              kind... of... hug.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.476
                    Ooh... ah!  

14:06.680 --> 14:09.348
Ma, look, you don't have        
to tell me all this stuff.      

14:09.416 --> 14:11.150
I already know.                 

14:11.217 --> 14:13.552
                All right, who's
                 the dirty mouth

14:13.620 --> 14:15.587
              who's been telling
            my son these things?

14:22.896 --> 14:27.599
    Only, um... only I used     
  a different word for "hug."   

14:31.071 --> 14:34.707
            Here's a pamphlet to
        fill in the many gaps   

14:34.774 --> 14:37.276
            left by lover-boy   
                     over there.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.812
         Read it. Read it before
             your wedding night.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.881
"Howard's New Feelings".        

14:42.982 --> 14:45.150
    My parents are thrilled!    

14:45.218 --> 14:48.120
  They're giving us a freezer   
         full of meat!          

14:48.188 --> 14:50.289
        Wow! Huh?               

14:50.357 --> 14:52.024
        Well, let's get busy.   

14:52.092 --> 14:53.926
          We have so much to do.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.061
  We have to shop for a dress   

14:56.129 --> 14:57.996
  and get a marriage license.   

14:58.064 --> 14:59.231
Oh, and the bakery!             

14:59.466 --> 15:00.766
             We're going to have

15:00.834 --> 15:03.202
        a great big chocolate   
                wedding cake.   

15:03.303 --> 15:04.670
    Whoa! Hold on there, Ma.    

15:04.738 --> 15:05.971
     You know, I'm allergic     
  to chocolate, don't forget.   

15:06.039 --> 15:08.674
    Then you may have           
        graham crackers.        

15:10.810 --> 15:12.244
            Really?             

15:14.114 --> 15:17.483
            Well, I'm off to get
          that marriage license.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.884
Now, before you go, Cliff,      

15:18.985 --> 15:21.687
            I'd like to offer   
             my congratulations.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.390
                I, for one, will
             be enthusiastically
      tracking your development.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.292
                I mean, uh...   
            sharing your joy.   

15:27.360 --> 15:29.628
Thank you, Lilith.              

15:29.696 --> 15:31.030
Thank you very much.            

15:32.799 --> 15:35.100
                    Well, Cliff,
              Cliff, Cliff, huh?

15:35.168 --> 15:37.503
      His life is never going to
         be the same after this.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.972
    Yeah. Regular sex.          

15:40.040 --> 15:41.740
                  Wait a minute.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.375
              I thought you said
         he was getting married.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.814
             CARLA:             
    Uh... Sammy, two beers.     

15:48.882 --> 15:49.948
    Get them yourself.          

15:50.150 --> 15:51.350
                  You okay, Sam?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.718
  It's none of your business.   

15:52.819 --> 15:54.153
         Sam, we're out         
        of olives.              

15:54.220 --> 15:56.755
That's your problem,            
isn't it?                       

15:56.856 --> 15:58.357
  Gee, these shorts are cold!   

16:07.567 --> 16:09.535
                I couldn't help 
                noticing, dear, 

16:09.602 --> 16:14.106
            that all the wedding
             dresses you favored
                were pure white.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.709
                    Can I assume
             that's appropriate?

16:18.745 --> 16:20.846
    Well, here we are!          

16:20.914 --> 16:22.748
  All right. Message received.  

16:22.882 --> 16:24.550
      None of my business.      

16:24.617 --> 16:28.287
              Say, uh... listen.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.588
                 You're going to
             marry Cliff, right?

16:29.656 --> 16:30.689
        That's right.           

16:30.757 --> 16:33.926
            Well, could you just
        do me a little favor?   

16:33.993 --> 16:35.361
    What's that?                

16:35.428 --> 16:40.032
            Don't bring any more
        Clavins into this world.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.534
                 It's not right.
            It's just not right.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.537
    Poor, poor Carla.           

16:45.605 --> 16:49.174
    Cliff told me all about     
  the affair you had with him.  

16:52.612 --> 16:56.248
  And I just want you to know   
     that I bear no grudge.     

16:56.316 --> 17:00.085
                    I... I...   

17:00.153 --> 17:03.522
                        I...    

17:03.590 --> 17:06.125
I didn't know Carla             
and Cliff had an affair.        

17:06.192 --> 17:08.926
That explains a lot.            

17:08.994 --> 17:10.762
That poor woman.                

17:10.829 --> 17:14.233
    I know he cut her deeply    
when he broke up with her.      

17:14.300 --> 17:16.868
         But, Rebecca,          
 you seem to have bounced back. 

17:25.011 --> 17:26.612
     Sammy, how's it going?     

17:26.680 --> 17:29.748
 You ever try to start your car 
on a really cold winter morning?

17:29.816 --> 17:31.583
    Yeah. Sure.                 

17:31.651 --> 17:32.985
              Yeah, well, nobody
             in their right mind

17:33.053 --> 17:34.086
would expect it to start.       
          Am I right?           

17:34.154 --> 17:35.187
      Yeah. You're right.       

17:35.255 --> 17:36.755
          Yeah, well,           
you tell that to Rebecca!       

17:36.823 --> 17:40.426
 Oh! Sorry I'm late, everybody. 

17:40.493 --> 17:42.061
         How you doing?         

17:42.128 --> 17:43.629
      You wouldn't believe      
        all those people        

17:43.697 --> 17:45.698
  down at the marriage bureau   
     waiting for a license.     

17:45.765 --> 17:48.300
      Pretty soon, Maggie,      
  it's going to be you and me.  

17:48.368 --> 17:49.635
  We'll be joining them, huh?   

17:49.703 --> 17:51.036
            I can't wait, Cliff.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.339
      I'm one happy fella!      

17:53.406 --> 17:54.807
        Gosh, I'm happy!        

17:54.874 --> 17:56.742
     And you're the one who     
    made me so happy, honey.    

17:58.144 --> 17:59.578
    You're all invited          
        to the wedding.         

17:59.646 --> 18:01.180
              Doc, can I see you
          in the office, please?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.781
          Sure, Cliff.          

18:02.849 --> 18:05.751
      I'll be with you in       
  just a minute, my betrothed.  

18:05.819 --> 18:06.952
  Hey, who would have thought   

18:07.020 --> 18:08.654
     Cliff Clavin was ready     
        for commitment?         

18:11.424 --> 18:13.292
Doc, you gotta help me.         

18:13.360 --> 18:15.661
I mean, it's all                
happening so fast.              

18:15.729 --> 18:17.830
One minute, I...                
I'm leading my life.            

18:17.897 --> 18:19.498
And the next minute,            
before you know it,             

18:19.566 --> 18:21.266
I'm standing in a line          
down at the marriage bureau     

18:21.334 --> 18:23.068
with a bunch of other people    
waiting for a license.          

18:23.136 --> 18:25.838
I looked into their eyes.       
You know what I saw?            

18:25.905 --> 18:29.241
      The smell of death.       

18:31.044 --> 18:34.680
    Aren't you exaggerating     
          just a bit?           

18:34.748 --> 18:36.615
Oh, no. Fras,                   
when I was a teenager,          

18:36.683 --> 18:39.284
I used to work                  
at a slaughterhouse.            

18:39.386 --> 18:41.553
    And I watched them          
when they brought them in,      

18:41.621 --> 18:44.757
    and I watched them          
    when they took them out.    

18:44.824 --> 18:46.759
      But I've never seen       
    nothing like that.          

18:48.528 --> 18:50.829
      Ma's really done it       
        to me this time.        

18:50.897 --> 18:53.032
     Cliff, why do you have     
      to do what she says?      

18:53.099 --> 18:55.200
        She's Ma.               

18:55.268 --> 18:56.468
            Look. Think back.   

18:56.536 --> 18:59.104
     Have you ever stood up     
        to your mother?         

18:59.172 --> 19:01.807
     Have you ever stood up     
        to Lilith?              

19:01.875 --> 19:03.809
         Touché, Cliff,         

19:03.877 --> 19:05.644
                but we're not   
                  discussing me.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.312
Look, Fras, I know              
what you're trying to say--     

19:07.380 --> 19:09.081
that I should stand up          
to my mother.                   

19:09.149 --> 19:10.449
Well, you're not                
telling me anything             

19:10.517 --> 19:11.750
I haven't                       
been telling myself             

19:11.818 --> 19:14.987
since my 35th birthday.         

19:15.055 --> 19:17.956
It's just that, if I do,        
it'll hurt Ma's feelings.       

19:18.024 --> 19:19.692
                      What about
            Cliff's feelings?   

19:19.759 --> 19:23.328
Who cares about                 
Cliff's feelings?               
                     You should.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.031
    You have the right to do    
 with your life what you will.  

19:26.099 --> 19:28.267
    Don't worry about           
 what other people will think.  

19:28.368 --> 19:31.003
                      Your first
                  responsibility
                      is to you.

19:31.071 --> 19:32.971
     You're a real person,      

19:33.039 --> 19:35.007
    worthy of consideration     
          and respect.          

19:35.075 --> 19:37.476
Am I interrupting               
anything?                       

19:37.544 --> 19:39.878
                 Oh, no, Maggie.
         Just nothing important.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.380
     Cliff was, you know...     

19:48.788 --> 19:51.890
Cliff, is something wrong?      

19:51.958 --> 19:54.960
                  It's about the
              wedding, Margaret.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.830
         I don't think I want to
        get married just yet.   

19:57.931 --> 20:01.000
Why, Cliff?                     
Don't you love me?              

20:01.067 --> 20:03.736
              Oh, Maggie,       
         of course I love you.  

20:03.803 --> 20:05.504
             But, if we're going
                 to get married,

20:05.572 --> 20:07.473
             I want it to be our
         decision, and not Ma's.

20:07.540 --> 20:11.744
      That woman has been making
decisions for me long enough.   

20:11.811 --> 20:15.247
        We'll know in our hearts
         when the time is right.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.017
        Oh, Cliff!              

20:20.453 --> 20:23.722
                    Maggie, when
            I propose to you,   

20:23.790 --> 20:27.559
            it's going to be the
             most romantic thing
              you've ever heard.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.795
I don't know, Cliff.            

20:29.863 --> 20:32.164
It would be awfully hard        
to beat the way your ma said it.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.299
                    Yeah.       

20:34.367 --> 20:35.768
Oh, Margaret?                   

20:35.835 --> 20:38.704
You'll, uh... you'll still      
be my girlfriend, won't you?    

20:38.805 --> 20:40.506
                 Oh, yes, Cliff.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.041
                    I understand
                     completely.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.209
                  You want to be
                your own man.   

20:44.277 --> 20:47.246
      Exactly. All right!       

20:47.313 --> 20:49.948
Now, would you get out there    
and tell that to my mother?     

20:53.119 --> 20:55.187
            That's wonderful.   

20:55.255 --> 20:57.556
             Good news, kiddies!

20:57.624 --> 20:59.992
             The wedding's going
        to have a luau theme.   

21:00.060 --> 21:04.029
                     I've booked
                    the Tiki Hut
                  on Route Nine.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.132
Ma, I want to talk to you.      

21:07.200 --> 21:09.401
     You can stop grinding      
     that organ right now.      

21:09.469 --> 21:11.437
 I'm taking off my little hat.  

21:11.504 --> 21:13.906
  I'm not your monkey anymore.  

21:13.973 --> 21:16.408
            Clifford, we haven't
                got time for the
                  monkey speech.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.877
We're too busy.                 

21:18.945 --> 21:21.180
        I love you, Ma,         

21:21.247 --> 21:23.082
         but I'm not going to be
        railroaded into marriage

21:23.149 --> 21:24.249
         just to make you happy.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.285
             You've been running
            my life long enough,

21:26.353 --> 21:28.153
            and it's time for me
              to take the wheel.

21:28.221 --> 21:30.222
     Why, Clifford Clavin,      

21:30.290 --> 21:33.659
    how dare you speak          
to your mother like that?!      

21:33.727 --> 21:35.327
            I'm 42 years old,   

21:35.395 --> 21:36.595
            and I'll speak to   
             you any way I wish!

21:36.663 --> 21:39.898
            My word!            

21:40.000 --> 21:41.367
        Come on, Maggie!        

21:42.802 --> 21:46.505
 We got a lot of living to do!  

21:49.242 --> 21:50.342
             Whoo!              

21:52.178 --> 21:53.479
            Oh! Oh!             

21:54.748 --> 21:56.448
You still with me, Maggie?      

21:56.516 --> 21:58.684
        My tooth, Cliff!        

22:01.855 --> 22:03.288
        MARGARET:               
              Ohh!              

22:03.356 --> 22:06.091
        (both screaming)        

22:07.794 --> 22:12.865
        I see I still have to do
         everything for the boy.

22:18.705 --> 22:19.972
         (Cliff groans)         

22:25.779 --> 22:29.548
      I'll be back for you      
     in a minute, Clifford!
