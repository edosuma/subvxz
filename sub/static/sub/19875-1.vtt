00:18.019 --> 00:22.254
<i>In the year 2065,
war destroyed our world.</i>

00:23.290 --> 00:24.757
<i>In our desperation,</i>

00:24.759 --> 00:27.159
<i>we searched the stars
for a new home.</i>

00:28.095 --> 00:30.215
<i>And just when we thought
we'd found one,</i>

00:30.664 --> 00:33.365
<i>we realized we were not alone.</i>

00:34.101 --> 00:37.036
<i>We have
the most important mission:</i>

00:37.038 --> 00:38.437
<i>we must not fail.</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:40.739
<i>We are the last.</i>

00:42.243 --> 00:44.643
<i>And why, I hear you ask.</i>

00:44.645 --> 00:45.645
<i>Life.</i>

00:47.348 --> 00:50.616
<i>Survival is built into the very
genome of every living thing.</i>

00:50.785 --> 00:54.319
<i>To endure, to evolve,
at any cost.</i>

00:56.190 --> 00:57.656
<i>For billions of years,</i>

00:57.658 --> 00:59.191
<i>the planet Earth was home</i>

00:59.193 --> 01:01.353
<i>to many beautiful
and wonderful creatures,</i>

01:01.796 --> 01:04.830
<i>all living in harmony
with their environment.</i>

01:05.266 --> 01:08.067
<i>It includes of course
the human race,</i>

01:08.536 --> 01:10.803
<i>the so called
"masters of their fate."</i>

01:11.605 --> 01:13.372
<i>The dominant species,</i>

01:13.374 --> 01:15.494
<i>who over millions of years
of evolution</i>

01:15.810 --> 01:18.677
<i>reshaped their environment
for their every need.</i>

01:19.547 --> 01:23.749
<i>That was until seven years ago,
the year 2065,</i>

01:24.485 --> 01:25.851
<i>because unfortunately,</i>

01:26.220 --> 01:28.300
<i>that was the year
our beautiful planet</i>

01:28.556 --> 01:30.589
<i>was destroyed in a nuclear war</i>

01:31.258 --> 01:33.592
<i>that lasted
just sixty-seven minutes.</i>

01:34.495 --> 01:36.428
<i>The bombs dropped so fast</i>

01:36.430 --> 01:38.442
<i>that no one had time
to say goodbye,</i>

01:38.466 --> 01:41.266
<i>to pray,
or to call their loved ones.</i>

01:41.569 --> 01:45.504
<i>The world's population
barely knew a war had started,</i>

01:45.506 --> 01:50.109
<i>but in the blink of an eye,
our home was gone.</i>

01:54.215 --> 01:57.449
<i>The few humans that survived
the post-apocalyptic world</i>

01:57.451 --> 01:58.717
<i>fled in scout ships</i>

01:58.719 --> 02:01.120
<i>to all the know corners
of the galaxy,</i>

02:01.455 --> 02:03.655
<i>looking for a new planet
to call home.</i>

02:04.358 --> 02:06.391
<i>I am on
one of those scout ships.</i>

02:06.393 --> 02:08.860
<i>For all I know,
we could be the last.</i>

02:09.597 --> 02:12.598
<i>When we received the signal
from the Pegasus,</i>

02:12.600 --> 02:14.399
<i>we altered our course</i>

02:14.401 --> 02:17.202
<i>and headed for what
would become our new home.</i>

02:17.838 --> 02:21.640
<i>The Pegasus' sacrifice meant
that humanity could start afresh</i>

02:22.276 --> 02:23.442
<i>and build a future.</i>

02:26.614 --> 02:30.616
<i>Knowing...
that we are not the last.</i>

02:38.526 --> 02:41.226
<i>All right,
I'm removing the last screw now.</i>

02:41.228 --> 02:42.661
<i>Make sure you keep a hold of it.</i>

02:42.663 --> 02:44.596
<i>Relax man,
these are steady hands.</i>

02:44.598 --> 02:47.199
<i>I just don't want
to lose any if we can help it.</i>

02:47.334 --> 02:49.835
<i>Yeah, there's already
enough screws loose around here.</i>

02:49.837 --> 02:51.770
<i>Michael,
are you disparaging the sanity</i>

02:51.772 --> 02:53.338
<i>of certain crew members
on board,</i>

02:53.340 --> 02:55.274
<i>or are you making
libelous insinuations</i>

02:55.276 --> 02:56.875
<i>about the stability of my ship?</i>

02:57.211 --> 03:00.679
<i>Your ship? Fuck you man!
This ship, sweetheart, is mine!</i>

03:00.681 --> 03:03.248
<i>Woah woah woah, fly boy!</i>

03:03.250 --> 03:04.850
<i>Anybody can point
this crate in a direction</i>

03:04.852 --> 03:06.585
<i>and press
the button marked "go",</i>

03:06.587 --> 03:08.287
<i>but it takes a genius,
and let's not forget, Mike,</i>

03:08.289 --> 03:09.755
<i>I'm a genius,</i>

03:09.757 --> 03:11.690
<i>moving
and B: from falling apart.</i>

03:11.692 --> 03:13.525
<i>All right?
That makes her mine.</i>

03:13.527 --> 03:15.727
<i>Sorry to interrupt you
ladies, but this "crate"</i>

03:15.729 --> 03:18.830
<i>as you so elegantly call it,
Pete, is mine.</i>

03:18.832 --> 03:19.865
<i>Captain.</i>

03:19.867 --> 03:21.587
<i>Whose ship is it?</i>

03:22.236 --> 03:23.769
<i>Jon's ship.</i>

03:23.771 --> 03:25.837
<i>Good girls. Now,
how much longer on this work?</i>

03:25.839 --> 03:27.706
<i>I'm just installing
the new valve now.</i>

03:27.708 --> 03:29.641
<i>Copy that.
Quick as you can, gentlemen.</i>

03:29.643 --> 03:31.476
<i>I want engines started
inside of an hour.</i>

03:31.478 --> 03:32.911
<i>There's a dust cloud
headed this way</i>

03:32.913 --> 03:34.813
<i>that'll require more
than a valve being fixed</i>

03:34.815 --> 03:35.747
<i>if it hits us.</i>

03:35.749 --> 03:37.516
<i>Understood sir.</i>

03:37.518 --> 03:40.719
<i>Moving double quick.
Where were we?</i>

03:40.721 --> 03:42.988
Let me just make sure
he's not still listening.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.425
Captain?
Ok yes, where were we?

03:46.427 --> 03:47.993
This ship, Mike, is mine

03:47.995 --> 03:49.795
<i>because I'm the one that
keeps it from falling apart</i>

03:49.797 --> 03:53.232
<i>every time somebody called Mike
takes us too close to a star</i>

03:53.234 --> 03:55.334
<i>or through an asteroid belt
or into a black hole</i>

03:55.336 --> 03:56.635
<i>or whatever it is
you joyriders do</i>

03:56.637 --> 03:58.303
<i>when you're fumbling
at those controls.</i>

03:58.305 --> 04:00.239
<i>Woah, woah,
she may not be falling apart</i>

04:00.241 --> 04:01.907
<i>but you sure ain't the one
out here fixing her right now.</i>

04:01.909 --> 04:03.342
<i>Well, delegation of duties</i>

04:03.344 --> 04:04.710
<i>is part of my job you see.</i>

04:04.712 --> 04:06.011
<i>There's no point
in risking me going outside</i>

04:06.013 --> 04:07.512
<i>to fix a plasma valve</i>

04:07.514 --> 04:08.847
<i>when I can talk you
through it, Mike.</i>

04:08.849 --> 04:10.482
<i>This is a job
a seven year old could do.</i>

04:10.484 --> 04:11.583
<i>Oh well next time
we'll just send Lila.</i>

04:11.585 --> 04:12.818
The suits are too big for her.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.319
Besides which,
we're supposed to only send

04:14.321 --> 04:15.821
expendable members
of crew outside.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.723
<i>Oh fuck you
and your expendability, man.</i>

04:17.725 --> 04:18.991
<i>Without me, we don't fly.</i>

04:18.993 --> 04:20.559
<i>That's so weird, because I think</i>

04:20.560 --> 04:22.294
<i>because I think
the Captain and the co-pilot</i>

04:22.296 --> 04:23.929
<i>are taking the next two
piloting shifts-is that right?</i>

04:23.931 --> 04:26.331
<i>Hey, no one fies like I do.</i>

04:26.333 --> 04:27.877
<i>All right,
I make it an art form.</i>

04:27.901 --> 04:29.301
<i>Anyway Mr. Important,</i>

04:29.303 --> 04:30.836
<i>I'm ready to put
this new valve in</i>

04:30.838 --> 04:32.682
<i>and get the fuck back inside
so I can kick your ass.</i>

04:32.706 --> 04:34.626
Well now,
there's incentive for me.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.510
Ok, you need to see that
the corners are all lined up.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.812
Make sure the grooves match too,

04:40.814 --> 04:41.980
that way you will know

04:41.982 --> 04:43.994
that you don't have it
in back to front.

04:44.018 --> 04:46.285
<i>Have you got
the manual in front of you?</i>

04:46.287 --> 04:47.786
<i>I thought you were a genius!</i>

04:47.788 --> 04:49.554
<i>Screw the screws
back in and reseal the panel</i>

04:49.556 --> 04:50.889
<i>and then you're done, all right.</i>

04:50.891 --> 04:52.624
<i>And then I can run
a pressure test on it.</i>

04:52.626 --> 04:54.459
<i>Woah woah woah, wait
until I'm clear of this section</i>

04:54.461 --> 04:55.861
<i>before you run
any pressure test.</i>

04:55.863 --> 04:57.329
<i>Don't worry, relax,</i>

04:57.331 --> 04:58.530
<i>there's nothing going
to blow you off</i>

04:58.532 --> 04:59.898
<i>and push you deep into space,</i>

04:59.900 --> 05:01.940
<i>as long as you've done
a proper job.</i>

05:03.937 --> 05:05.570
<i>Warning.</i>

05:05.572 --> 05:07.372
<i>Pressure must be released
in the helium tanks.</i>

05:10.611 --> 05:12.371
<i>- Shit.
- Mike?</i>

05:12.680 --> 05:13.912
<i>I just dropped
one of the screws.</i>

05:13.914 --> 05:15.013
<i>I can go after it.</i>

05:15.015 --> 05:16.615
<i>Use one of the spares.</i>

05:16.617 --> 05:18.428
<i>You got many of these left?</i>

05:18.452 --> 05:20.412
After seven years?
Mate, don't ask.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.690
<i>Ok. All right, sorry again man.</i>

05:25.693 --> 05:27.459
<i>Hey, what's for dinner tonight?</i>

05:27.795 --> 05:29.561
<i>Mate, it's your favourite.</i>

05:29.563 --> 05:32.083
<i>Oh yeah? Steak, potato
salad and a side of onion rings?</i>

05:32.433 --> 05:33.932
<i>It's my lucky night.</i>

05:33.934 --> 05:35.500
<i>You bet. Edward's
pulling out all the stops.</i>

05:35.502 --> 05:37.822
<i>We're all grateful
for last night's feast, you see.</i>

05:37.871 --> 05:40.372
<i>Hatch is sealed.
Heading back to airlock.</i>

05:42.109 --> 05:44.229
<i>- Mike to the bridge.</i>
- Go ahead.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.646
<i>Jane, I've finished
doing Pete's job for him.</i>

05:47.648 --> 05:48.680
<i>I'm coming back in.</i>

05:48.682 --> 05:50.982
Copy that.
Course is already plotted.

05:51.552 --> 05:52.918
<i>Mike is now back on board.</i>

05:52.920 --> 05:54.453
<i>And the airlock is sealed.</i>

05:54.588 --> 05:57.389
Firing it up. Good job, boys.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.595
Whereas the Pegasus flies
through space,

06:03.797 --> 06:06.431
a submarine flies through water.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.567
Do you have a submarine?

06:09.403 --> 06:14.639
Me? No.
But, I have fixed a few.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.675
What else is there in the ocean?

06:18.479 --> 06:20.045
In the ocean?

06:20.047 --> 06:22.007
There's loads of things
in the ocean.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.816
Did I tell you
about the coral reef?

06:25.919 --> 06:27.619
I didn't?

06:27.621 --> 06:30.522
Well, the coral reef
is like a big,

06:30.524 --> 06:32.157
beautiful underwater garden.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.793
A million different colours.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.896
All stretching out
for miles and miles

06:37.898 --> 06:40.565
and you can explore it
with all the fishes.

06:42.002 --> 06:45.670
Can we watch Jaws tonight?
You said that was about the sea.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.507
Listen, that was about..

06:48.509 --> 06:50.542
It is about the sea, yep.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.844
But I got a big,
kind of a feeling

06:52.846 --> 06:56.515
that Hayley's not going to like
me showing you Jaws

06:56.917 --> 06:58.650
We could keep it a secret?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.487
We could keep it a secret.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.150
But only because you're
my favourite shipmate.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.758
Got it?

07:07.194 --> 07:08.760
Don't you have school to be at?

07:10.464 --> 07:12.063
You sure?

07:12.065 --> 07:14.566
<i>Hayley, it is now
time for Lila's school lesson.</i>

07:14.568 --> 07:16.902
<i>She is currently
with Pete in engineering.</i>

07:16.904 --> 07:19.604
<i>Please let me know if you
would like me to remind her.</i>

07:19.606 --> 07:21.706
<i>I found your last lesson
on human history</i>

07:21.708 --> 07:23.041
<i>particularly interesting.</i>

07:38.959 --> 07:41.560
<i>Controlled substance
locker code accepted.</i>

07:41.562 --> 07:43.161
<i>Medical officer Hayley Matthews.</i>

08:06.854 --> 08:07.870
Oh god.

08:07.871 --> 08:08.887
Thruster unit four
is a little sluggish.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.009
It's kicking in two seconds
after the others.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.491
I'll run a signal check.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.260
Sending a test signal
to units A through F.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.030
How was your walk outside?
Nice weather?

08:19.032 --> 08:20.732
Oh yeah, the breeze was nice.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.702
Just another another
average day at work, huh?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.070
Every day is an average day.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.905
Not today it isn't.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.074
Oh yeah, why's that?

08:29.076 --> 08:30.942
Today is someone's special day.

08:31.745 --> 08:32.943
What do you mean?

08:37.284 --> 08:38.650
Happy birthday.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.754
How the hell did you remember?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.289
It's my dad's,

08:44.291 --> 08:46.091
or it would be
my dad's tomorrow.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.413
When you let it slip last year
it just sort of stuck.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.802
Don't worry,
I haven't reminded anyone.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.964
God forbid we should
celebrate something.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.199
The years passing
isn't something

08:54.201 --> 08:56.034
I particularly want
to celebrate.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.737
No problem old man.
I'll just take the present back.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.805
Oh, no no, I didn't say
I didn't want the gift...

09:00.807 --> 09:01.973
What is it?

09:01.975 --> 09:04.042
Well, half the fun
is in the surprise!

09:04.878 --> 09:07.279
Ok. It better not be something
that's gonna jump out

09:07.281 --> 09:08.647
and bite me in the face.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.181
There goes the surprise.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.586
You made a cake?

09:15.789 --> 09:16.721
You?

09:16.723 --> 09:17.689
Made a cake?

09:17.691 --> 09:20.258
Actually...
I got Hayley to make it.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.193
I didn't want to waste
the ingredients

09:22.195 --> 09:24.275
fucking it up
after the first dozen times.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.738
It was part of a cookery
class for Lila.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.868
So actually this is a gift
from Lila and Hayley?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.903
Hey, I commissioned the work.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.573
Without me,
that cake wouldn't even exist!

09:35.108 --> 09:37.609
Will there be sea
where we're going?

09:38.345 --> 09:39.844
Probably not.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.615
I don't think the planet we're
heading to is even habitable.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.684
Everyone else says that
ours will be the one

09:45.686 --> 09:46.751
that has an atmosphere

09:46.753 --> 09:48.673
and everyone
else will come here.

09:49.222 --> 09:53.358
Well, everyone else is trying
to not make you worry,

09:54.161 --> 09:55.860
but what have I always told you?

09:55.862 --> 09:56.795
The truth.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.029
That's right.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.665
Pete always tells you the truth,
doesn't he?

10:02.336 --> 10:03.902
Because I will never lie to you.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.304
Now don't you have some
studying for Hayley to do?

10:06.873 --> 10:08.239
Ok, if Hayley asks where I am,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.161
will you say
you haven't seen me?

10:10.377 --> 10:11.843
Of course I will.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.397
But only because you're
my favourite member of crew.

10:15.398 --> 10:17.682
I guess I can lie to everyone
else. Go on, go.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.231
I hope that doesn't include me,
Mr. Burton.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.287
Of course not.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.723
An engineer never
lies to his captain.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.124
He might exaggerate sometimes

10:26.126 --> 10:28.171
just so you appreciate
the miracles he works down here.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.294
Good stuff.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.897
Now you can fix the
oxy-generation units on C deck.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.233
The other units are working
overtime to compensate,

10:35.235 --> 10:36.868
and if they start burning out

10:36.870 --> 10:39.337
then the minor problem of
breathing becomes a major issue.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.273
Especially when you waste oxygen

10:42.275 --> 10:44.843
by using welding equipment.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.811
They're not gonna burn out,
for one,

10:46.813 --> 10:48.146
I replaced the knackered unit

10:48.148 --> 10:50.048
with the one
from the escape pod,

10:50.050 --> 10:51.182
so we're all ok there.

10:51.184 --> 10:54.819
You can't use the unit
from the escape pod.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.688
First, it's not big enough

10:56.689 --> 10:58.289
to replace a unit
that serves a whole deck,

10:58.291 --> 11:01.359
and second,
it's from the escape pod!

11:01.361 --> 11:02.927
If any of us ever need it,

11:02.929 --> 11:04.829
we won't survive more than
a few minutes in there!

11:04.831 --> 11:05.830
Oh, you've got your eye
on it, have you?

11:05.832 --> 11:06.931
Oh that's not even funny.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.199
Enough, Gentlemen!

11:08.201 --> 11:10.402
Pete, I know
you have a lot to do right now,

11:10.737 --> 11:12.337
- but Edward's right.
- Edward's right.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.805
You need to put
the generator back

11:13.807 --> 11:15.306
on the pod where it belongs,

11:15.308 --> 11:17.668
and I need the one on level C
fixed in the next 24 hours.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.046
Otherwise you can go in the pod
and free up some oxygen

11:21.048 --> 11:22.147
for the rest of us.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.250
Yes, boss.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.852
Anything else?

11:29.156 --> 11:30.388
Nope.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.033
I'm sure we'll all be
quite hungry soon.

11:35.762 --> 11:36.861
Hmm.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.265
It is your night
to prepare dinner, isn't it?

11:41.835 --> 11:43.334
Such a great day!

11:48.975 --> 11:49.975
Well?

11:54.381 --> 11:57.048
The plasma overload did more
than screw the valve.

12:10.997 --> 12:14.866
Mmm-mm, thank you.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.035
Truly, your generosity
knows no bounds.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.471
Yeah, can I get that box back?

12:19.473 --> 12:21.005
Cos I may need that again
next year.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.108
It's mine, you gave it to me.
Thanks.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.143
There are crumbs in that.
I want in!

12:26.046 --> 12:27.846
All right. I guess, here you go.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.814
Thank you.
Good you know how to share.

12:29.816 --> 12:30.915
It's delicious.

12:31.184 --> 12:35.053
Mmm, I did good, right?
Oh that is good.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.222
- You got a little... Right here?
- Huh?

12:37.224 --> 12:38.890
No no, no, I'll get it.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.159
Yeah, right...

12:41.361 --> 12:43.294
- I'm just trying to-
- You're hitting on me!

12:43.296 --> 12:45.864
- What? I'm not hitting on you.
- You're totally hitting on me.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.265
No! You had something, you had-

12:47.267 --> 12:48.433
That is a move!

12:48.435 --> 12:49.868
- That is totally a move!
- It's not a move.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.369
Oh come on,
you think I don't know a move?

12:51.371 --> 12:52.971
What, seven years on a ship
and I don't know what a move is?

12:52.973 --> 12:54.533
- I was-
- Come on.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.975
Ok look, it's my birthday.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.410
It's my birthday.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.113
All right,
I'm gonna allow this. Come here.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.389
Are you kidding me?

13:11.391 --> 13:12.957
Pegasus,
is diagnostic done already?

13:12.959 --> 13:15.827
<i>Negative,
we have received communication.</i>

13:15.829 --> 13:18.062
That far out?
Where the hell is it from?

13:18.465 --> 13:19.497
<i>It is from the Utah.</i>

13:19.499 --> 13:20.499
What do they say?

13:21.468 --> 13:23.045
It's encrypted.
Captain's eyes only.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.402
Shit,
from where they were headed,

13:24.404 --> 13:26.104
it would take how long?

13:26.106 --> 13:28.139
I'm assuming they stayed on
course with their flight plan...

13:28.141 --> 13:30.441
That message would have been
sent four months ago.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.377
The only ship with that kind
of communication range,

13:32.379 --> 13:34.579
and a call that takes
that long to get through...

13:38.185 --> 13:39.334
It's gotta be important.

13:39.335 --> 13:40.484
I think you know it's been like
a tightrope for me

13:40.487 --> 13:42.053
since we left, Captain.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.888
I'm trying to balance
maintaining the systems

13:43.890 --> 13:45.290
with keeping enough in reserve.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.858
Actually I'm getting a bit
of extra efficiency-

13:46.860 --> 13:48.126
Pete, I know.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.095
Basically Captain, the engine
is working twice as hard

13:51.097 --> 13:52.297
as she should.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.915
I'm burning up antimatter
like there's no tomorrow,

13:53.916 --> 13:55.532
as a consequence
I've had to re-route-

13:55.535 --> 13:57.001
Pete... Pete.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.372
Captain we don't have
enough antimatter,

14:01.374 --> 14:03.254
now, to make the return journey.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.845
We can get there just fine,
we just can't make it home.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.690
- You're sure?
- Hundred percent.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.552
Pegasus, confirm my findings.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.287
<i>Findings confirmed, Pete.</i>

14:17.557 --> 14:19.057
<i>There is presently
not enough antimatter</i>

14:19.059 --> 14:20.058
<i>to return
to the Earth's solar system.</i>

14:20.060 --> 14:22.978
You should probably brief
the crew.

14:22.979 --> 14:25.897
No, no. Hope is what keeps
this ship going,

14:25.899 --> 14:27.779
I don't want to rob
them of that.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.269
I'll be honest, Cap,

14:32.906 --> 14:35.386
I'm running out of hope faster
than I'm running out of screws.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.577
<i>Captain, we have received
a transmission from the Utah.</i>

14:39.579 --> 14:41.980
<i>It is encoded
"Captain's eyes only".</i>

14:43.884 --> 14:45.917
Something will turn up,
it always does.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.052
Yep.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.233
I need you to keep this
between us until then, ok?

14:50.257 --> 14:51.257
Ok.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.672
<i>Attention all crew:</i>

15:07.674 --> 15:10.408
<i>Edward is delighted to announce
that dinner is ready.</i>

15:10.577 --> 15:13.344
<i>If you would all like to make
your way to the mess hall.</i>

15:13.346 --> 15:15.346
<i>I hope you all enjoy
your dinner.</i>

15:16.149 --> 15:18.182
<i>Please, always know...</i>

15:19.085 --> 15:20.451
<i>Always remember.</i>

15:21.388 --> 15:24.188
<i>I love you more
than anything in existence.</i>

15:25.959 --> 15:27.392
<i>I know you feel the same.</i>

15:28.695 --> 15:33.031
<i>I will always be with you.</i>

15:33.033 --> 15:34.465
<i>Complete your mission.</i>

15:36.303 --> 15:38.670
<i>It is the most important
thing for us both.</i>

15:41.708 --> 15:46.144
<i>The future of humanity
depends on it.</i>

15:46.146 --> 15:47.345
<i>Goodbye my love.</i>

15:47.547 --> 15:49.358
<i>End of message, sir.</i>

15:49.382 --> 15:51.349
What is it that you're drawing?

15:51.351 --> 15:53.051
- There you go.
- Thank you

15:53.053 --> 15:55.954
Right, here we go.
How yummy does this look?

15:55.956 --> 15:57.722
What the heck is this?
Somebody throw up?

15:57.724 --> 15:59.057
Come on, there's loads here.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.458
Not everyone's had a share yet.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.693
Just put a little more chow
on my plate.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.661
- Move along!
- Don't tell me to move along,

16:03.663 --> 16:04.662
just put some more fucking food
on my plate.

16:04.664 --> 16:05.697
Hey Mike! Come on.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.367
I'll get ill with him cooking
it anyways.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.601
He's probably running
experiments on us.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.337
Let it go.
Every morning you guys do this.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.604
Believe me,

16:15.108 --> 16:17.468
I have better subjects
for scientific inquiry than you.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.676
How's the steak, Mike?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.278
- Bitter.
- Oh wow.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.115
Today I'm gonna have it medium
with peppercorn sauce please,

16:24.117 --> 16:25.416
and a wine list.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.987
Where's the wine list Edward?

16:30.690 --> 16:32.423
Mmm, smells good.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.360
- Wine.
- Wine?

16:35.562 --> 16:40.331
Ah, nice bottle of Merlot...
Cabernet Sauvignon...

16:42.035 --> 16:44.213
You don't know about
these things, but, you know.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.604
Oh wow. This is amazing, Edward.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.406
Dickins would be proud of this.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.575
I can't wait
until it's your turn.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.510
- I'll do it.
- You try doing something special

16:52.512 --> 16:54.445
with unrefined protein
and carbohydrates.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.747
You know what,

16:55.749 --> 16:57.548
I'll happily take your shift,
Pete,

16:57.550 --> 16:59.584
if you can prioritize fixing
my shower head.

16:59.586 --> 17:00.718
Woah.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.320
What have I told you
about removing it

17:02.322 --> 17:05.223
from the mounting to, uh...
"test the water pressure"?

17:05.224 --> 17:07.791
What are you
doing in that shower?

17:07.794 --> 17:09.327
I gotta pass the time somehow.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.162
Hey, hey, hey,
listen up real quick.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.597
As you guys know,
we had to shut down the engines

17:12.598 --> 17:14.098
to make some minor repairs.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.633
Everything's fine,
just wanted to let you know.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.068
Everything's good to go.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.202
Sure.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.804
Gunning the engines
for seven years

17:19.806 --> 17:21.539
on a short range transport.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.473
- Oh woah woah.
- Here we go..

17:23.476 --> 17:26.377
We don't gun the engines.
We make this baby purr.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.378
He's got one good point there.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.901
These crafts were not made to go
the distance we're taking them.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.051
Really?! Are you sure?!

17:33.053 --> 17:35.053
Or comforts,
or privacy, or proper hygiene.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.454
Or a decent work out regime.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.221
No, we're getting
the pool installed next week,

17:37.223 --> 17:38.756
you know that?

17:38.758 --> 17:41.092
Yeah. Yeah, I've been meaning
to write a letter about that.

17:41.094 --> 17:44.128
Yeah, the pilot seat needs
fixing too. It's kinda squeaky-

17:44.130 --> 17:45.396
Everybody-

17:45.398 --> 17:46.164
There's a lot of squeaky
stuff in the-

17:46.166 --> 17:47.646
Woah!

17:48.134 --> 17:49.434
Let's let the Captain speak.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.396
I think he has something
to tell us.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.706
Captain?

17:55.708 --> 17:59.777
Ahh, we got the status
report in from the Utah.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.646
As you know they are
the ship closest to us

18:01.648 --> 18:04.415
and sent to scope
out sector 349G.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.525
The planet they were targeting
came back negative.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.941
So they've started their
final run back to the fleet.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.191
- Lucky bastards.
- Right, I...

18:13.193 --> 18:14.792
Listen, I know it's not good
news guys,

18:14.794 --> 18:16.828
but we still have a mission
to do. It just means

18:16.830 --> 18:19.630
we're going to be the ones that
get to discover the new Earth.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.432
Seven years wasted.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.588
Fourteen years
when they get back.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.170
Everyone knows
these issues were a lottery.

18:26.172 --> 18:27.872
Some people got journeys
twice as long.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.640
Some people got trips
of one year.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.882
They weren't even out
of comms range of the fleet.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.645
Why couldn't I have been
on one of those fucking ships

18:34.647 --> 18:36.114
rather than this one?

18:36.116 --> 18:37.248
I think we all
would have liked that.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.483
The longer the mission, Gerry,

18:38.485 --> 18:40.218
more chance there is
something going wrong,

18:40.220 --> 18:41.752
and the less chance there is
of getting back.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.554
Everyone knew that.
Everyone still knows that.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.789
- Here, here.
- That's right.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.524
We're looking good
for an old ship. Come on.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.725
I know Right.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.160
That's cold comfort for someone

18:49.162 --> 18:50.828
who couldn't make the choice
seven years ago.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.563
She's had seven years more
of life this way

18:52.565 --> 18:54.210
than she would have had
otherwise.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.767
- What life?
- How can you say that?

18:57.203 --> 18:59.270
She's got more goodness
in that little finger,

18:59.272 --> 19:01.232
than you've got
in your entire body.

19:01.407 --> 19:02.874
Well, that goodness
is going to wither

19:02.876 --> 19:04.709
on the vine and turn into dust-

19:04.711 --> 19:06.344
- Hey! Just, Gerry, what...?
- What are...?

19:06.346 --> 19:08.513
- Why do you always...?
- Hey, hey, hey. Listen. Listen.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.548
As long as we have a mission,
guys, we have hope.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.383
Okay? There's no reason
to believe this planet

19:12.385 --> 19:13.918
is not the right one.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.686
Okay?
It's in the habitable zone.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.688
Edward, all of your long range
scans have been encouraging,

19:17.690 --> 19:18.690
haven't they?

19:19.692 --> 19:20.892
So far.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.595
A little bit of elaboration.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.597
Yeah, can you give us more here?

19:27.767 --> 19:32.236
Well, long range scans
haven't shown anything,

19:32.672 --> 19:35.773
not habitable,
but it's still a longshot.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.277
We won't know until I send down
the probe.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.379
Statistically though,

19:43.216 --> 19:45.383
it's unlikely that ours
or any of the other ships

19:45.385 --> 19:46.517
are going to succeed.

19:47.654 --> 19:48.953
And what the hell?

19:48.955 --> 19:53.724
We can cultivate our own food
and we've got water recyc.

19:54.494 --> 19:57.228
We just turn this ship around
and head back

19:57.931 --> 19:59.530
and we will survive.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.698
I want to get back to work.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.466
Until the oxygen breaks down...

20:02.468 --> 20:04.335
I'm repairing those
right now, Edward.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.338
And then we slowly
suffocate to death.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.539
This is him being encouraging?

20:08.541 --> 20:09.807
This is him being Edward.

20:09.943 --> 20:12.910
I'm just saying
that's the situation.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.413
And I'm just saying
reign in the negativity.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.781
We've still got our job to do.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.983
In fact, your job just became
the most important.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.512
She's got a point, Edward.
Once we get there,

20:21.588 --> 20:23.699
I'm going to need you
all over the telemetry.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.822
We only got one probe.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.944
Looks like
you finally became useful.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.726
Fuck you.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.428
Can I have seconds now?

20:30.763 --> 20:32.897
I'd better get back
to the bridge.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.932
Pegasus is probably getting
bored flying herself.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.667
- I'll go.
- I thought you wanted more food.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.936
No, I'm done.
I'm not hungry anymore.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.673
Guys, we're almost there.

20:45.878 --> 20:49.780
You know, I do wonder though
about the Utah.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.583
And how many are the ships
that have been lost.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.385
It must have happened to some.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.487
I just hope that it wasn't
to ones that were on their way

20:56.489 --> 20:57.688
to a habitable world.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.591
Someone does find something.
It's seven years back.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.527
God knows how many heading
to where the new world is.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.564
- Hayley.
- What's up, sweetheart?

21:07.367 --> 21:10.468
Can I watch a movie tonight
with Pete?

21:11.004 --> 21:13.304
Not tonight.
We've got a big day tomorrow,

21:13.306 --> 21:14.872
so I need you to get
some proper sleep.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.507
And no one
is sneaking around the ship.

21:16.509 --> 21:19.277
You know, Gerry gets grumpy
if we wake him up.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.979
Oh, all right.
That's it. I'm gone.

21:28.821 --> 21:32.990
<i>Please, always
know, always remember...</i>

21:34.360 --> 21:37.428
<i>I love you more than anything
in existence...</i>

21:38.698 --> 21:40.031
<i>I know you feel the same.</i>

21:41.567 --> 21:44.402
<i>I will always be with you.</i>

21:45.705 --> 21:47.338
<i>Complete your mission...</i>

21:49.008 --> 21:51.609
<i>It is the most important thing.
For us both.</i>

21:54.681 --> 21:57.081
<i>The future of humanity
depends on it.</i>

21:58.851 --> 22:00.751
<i>Goodbye, my love.</i>

22:02.088 --> 22:04.048
<i>End of message, Captain.</i>

22:06.726 --> 22:08.806
<i>Would you like me
to play it once more?</i>

22:10.430 --> 22:11.729
Did you clean your teeth?

22:11.864 --> 22:14.332
Good, because I really
don't fancy doing

22:14.334 --> 22:15.533
any more dental work.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.613
Pulling out Pete's molar
was enough for me.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.104
Pete said he wouldn't
trust anyone else to do it.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.572
He said, for a nurse,

22:21.574 --> 22:23.641
you make a better dentist
than most dentists.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.544
Did he? Well,
that's very kind of him to say.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.679
Although, to be honest,
I'd be quite happy

22:28.681 --> 22:30.414
if I didn't get every
vaguely medicine

22:30.416 --> 22:31.982
related job on the ship.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.386
- Hey!
- You're busy?

22:35.388 --> 22:37.688
No, not even flying.
I've got it on autopilot.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.056
Wow.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.891
Jane's plotted too good a course
to bother changing.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.661
No, I meant "Wow, that's a
special kind of laziness".

22:43.663 --> 22:45.944
But seeing as you've got
a minute, it's time for...

22:46.366 --> 22:47.665
<i>Night of the Living Dead.</i>

22:47.667 --> 22:48.966
Why did you choose
that one again?

22:48.968 --> 22:51.135
Come on, this is a classic.
You love this one.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.004
Give it another chance.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.840
I know how much you love it
really deep down.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.108
You can't sleep, Pete?

22:58.010 --> 23:00.444
Well, if I can't sleep,
you're not sleeping.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.114
Where's the popcorn, buddy?

23:03.116 --> 23:05.583
Well, we could have some
recycled protein.

23:05.585 --> 23:06.717
I'll pass.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.523
What was my mom and dad like?

23:45.525 --> 23:46.891
They were great people.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.059
They were the best kind
of parents you could have,

23:49.061 --> 23:50.161
because they loved you
very much.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.629
Why did they leave me?

23:51.631 --> 23:54.432
Sweetheart,
they didn't leave you.

23:54.567 --> 23:58.102
They saved you when
they couldn't save themselves.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.772
You were too young to remember.

24:02.508 --> 24:04.789
There was a lot of confusion
when people left Earth.

24:07.513 --> 24:09.880
Some people got left behind
that really shouldn't have.

24:12.552 --> 24:13.918
There wasn't enough room.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.519
Did they die?

24:16.088 --> 24:17.621
I don't know, sweetheart.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.093
I know they wanted to find a new
home and that's why they gave

24:23.095 --> 24:25.196
you to me when you
were just this big.

24:25.198 --> 24:27.231
And now you
are big and grown-up.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.700
I don't think I could carry
you now, like I could back then.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.938
So I'm going to do my best.

24:35.508 --> 24:36.607
You know?

24:37.009 --> 24:38.889
I'm going to find
you a new home.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.712
We're going to be all right.

24:42.982 --> 24:43.981
You and me.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.149
Good night, Hayley.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.111
Good night, sweetheart.
Sweet dreams.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.115
You want some?

25:38.871 --> 25:39.970
Is she okay?

25:43.943 --> 25:45.309
She asked about her parents.

25:50.716 --> 25:51.749
What did you say?

25:52.018 --> 25:53.250
That they loved her...

25:55.988 --> 25:57.621
and they wanted her to be here.

25:57.623 --> 25:59.983
One day you're going to have
to tell her what happened.

26:01.627 --> 26:02.993
I know.

26:05.331 --> 26:08.232
Not today.
She's too young.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.192
I really thought the Utah
could have been the one.

27:07.059 --> 27:10.160
I mean I know anyone of us
could have been the one,

27:10.963 --> 27:12.997
but that seemed to really make
a good fit.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.977
Some have a better chance
than others.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.800
Just focus on our mission.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.403
If you keep thinking about
all the others, you'll go crazy.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.271
Someone will find a place.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.641
Whoever does
is going to be remembered.

27:24.210 --> 27:27.645
Like the first people to fly
or walk on the Moon or Mars.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.281
No one forgets their names.
And no one is going to forget

27:31.283 --> 27:34.184
the first people to find
the next alien world,

27:34.353 --> 27:36.253
especially if there's something
memorable to say.

27:36.255 --> 27:39.156
<i>Jane, do you mean like Neil
Armstrong's One small step?</i>

27:39.158 --> 27:40.924
Yeah. Although,

27:40.926 --> 27:43.093
if I knew I was going to be
the first person to walk

27:43.095 --> 27:44.228
in a new world,

27:45.398 --> 27:47.518
I'd sell my first line to the
highest bidder.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.701
- You're kidding.
- No.

27:50.702 --> 27:52.247
Sing a jingle,
say an advertising slogan.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.771
It'd be remembered forever.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.406
It'd worth a fortune.

27:55.408 --> 27:57.174
Be no different
to wearing branding.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.843
I'm pretty sure most
of the advertising executives

27:59.845 --> 28:01.278
burnt up in the war.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.914
You're going to have to settle
for something profound.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.182
Something profound?

28:07.153 --> 28:08.786
<i>Girls,</i>

28:08.788 --> 28:10.854
<i>although Neil Armstrong
said his words just came to him</i>

28:10.856 --> 28:13.123
<i>and were never pre-written.
After that mission,</i>

28:13.125 --> 28:16.126
<i>NASA pre-wrote many speeches
like James Church's speech</i>

28:16.729 --> 28:18.362
<i>for when he first walked
on Mars,</i>

28:18.364 --> 28:21.131
<i>there were many not used
and all of them in my library.</i>

28:21.133 --> 28:23.167
<i>I will select some
for you to read</i>

28:23.169 --> 28:26.236
<i>as inspiration and send them
to your personal library.</i>

28:26.739 --> 28:28.779
I'm thinking about having sex
with Pete.

28:29.709 --> 28:30.941
Does he know this?

28:31.444 --> 28:34.845
No.
Or at least I haven't told him.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.181
- I think he'll be up for it.
- Yeah, he is a man.

28:37.183 --> 28:41.385
I just really miss that feeling
of a man on top of me, you know.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.189
Why Pete, out of interest?

28:45.791 --> 28:47.858
I just get the impression
he'd try very hard.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.860
Make sense
you two getting together.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.329
You're the nearest thing
to parents to Lila.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.371
I don't want to get together
with Pete.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.334
I was just joking.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.437
Just, forget it.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.308
Fair enough.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.744
Just let him fix
the oxy-unit first.

29:06.746 --> 29:09.213
Otherwise you'll be engaging
in an auto asphyxiation.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.186
Shhh... I love this part.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.938
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

29:34.940 --> 29:36.774
<i>I hope you all slept well.</i>

29:36.776 --> 29:39.243
<i>The Captain would like
to see you at 08:00</i>

29:39.245 --> 29:41.345
<i>in the Mess Hall,
before breakfast.</i>

29:41.947 --> 29:43.180
<i>Thank you.</i>

29:50.289 --> 29:51.455
Morning.

29:51.457 --> 29:52.890
- Morning.
- Where is Lila?

29:52.892 --> 29:54.124
She's still asleep.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.226
Gerry?

29:56.228 --> 29:57.361
He's hungover.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.230
All right.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.649
Look, guys, tomorrow we're
entering the target system.

30:02.650 --> 30:05.067
When we are close enough,
we're going to launch the probe,

30:05.070 --> 30:06.870
we're going to start
receiving telemetry.

30:06.872 --> 30:08.752
Edward,
do you want to take over?

30:08.841 --> 30:10.941
Well, we're looking
for two priorities.

30:11.844 --> 30:14.845
One is an atmosphere
comparable to ours,

30:15.080 --> 30:17.314
nitrogen, oxygen, argon.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.285
And the other is presence
of water or ice.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.520
Those are the two essentials.

30:23.522 --> 30:26.824
On the would be nice list
is an existing ecosystem

30:26.826 --> 30:29.860
with edible flora and fauna.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.061
What about animals?

30:31.063 --> 30:32.396
Yeah. We're expecting
aliens down there?

30:32.398 --> 30:34.438
Oh, just a bit of poultry
would be nice.

30:35.134 --> 30:38.368
No, non-deadly
indigenous creatures

30:38.370 --> 30:40.537
are on the unlikely list.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.339
Once the probe is launched,

30:42.341 --> 30:45.108
we just keep taking
continuous readings

30:45.110 --> 30:47.030
until we get
a conclusive result.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.180
Look, guys, if the results
come back positive,

30:50.182 --> 30:53.350
we send a signal back
to the fleet before we land.

30:53.586 --> 30:55.619
And if the results
read negative?

30:56.322 --> 30:58.188
If it's not habitable,
then we move on.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.324
And that's all?
Back to the fleet?

31:01.393 --> 31:02.593
That's the plan.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.430
All right, guys. Look.
Stay sharp.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.098
We're almost there. Okay?

31:09.134 --> 31:10.400
Let's have a good day.

31:12.972 --> 31:13.972
Show me..

32:58.377 --> 33:01.044
It's getting worse.
How are you feeling?

33:02.982 --> 33:04.581
Not particularly great.

33:05.985 --> 33:09.286
I wonder if it has less to do
with the illness now.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.690
I've always considered
the possibility

33:13.692 --> 33:15.325
that I'd die on this ship.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.995
Nothing's certain, Gerry.

33:19.164 --> 33:22.432
I'm not even sure if the species
deserves a second chance.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.535
We'd just make
the same mistakes.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.672
What mistakes
wouldn't you make again?

33:29.508 --> 33:31.174
Trusting the Chinese.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.309
Very P.C.

33:32.311 --> 33:33.610
No, very true, you mean.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.178
Perhaps for your generation.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.514
Forgive me.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.550
And I thought you were
one of the last of mankind.

33:40.753 --> 33:44.488
Homeless, running
around aimlessly like me.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.434
Look. Gerry...

33:46.458 --> 33:47.691
Oh! Man...

33:47.693 --> 33:48.759
Hold on.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.427
No, no, no. Okay.
Anyway, thanks,

33:50.429 --> 33:52.262
I'm sorry
about the depressing thoughts.

33:52.264 --> 33:54.097
Hang on. Let me give you
something for the pain

33:54.099 --> 33:56.133
that you're quite obviously in.

33:56.135 --> 33:57.367
Now, this stuff-

33:57.369 --> 33:59.219
<i>Controlled
substances locker code accepted.</i>

33:59.220 --> 34:01.070
I'm fine, really.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.233
<i>Medical officer,
Hayley Matthews.</i>

34:04.476 --> 34:05.509
Pegasus.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.110
Who apart from me has access

34:08.112 --> 34:10.058
to the controlled
substance's locker?

34:10.081 --> 34:12.748
<i>Access is restricted
to yourself and the Captain.</i>

34:12.751 --> 34:15.252
<i>Your last access
was 14 hours ago.</i>

34:16.554 --> 34:17.687
I'm sorry.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.322
Sorry I found out?

34:21.592 --> 34:22.692
Yes.

34:22.694 --> 34:25.594
Look. Gerry,
if you were in this much pain,

34:25.597 --> 34:27.097
you should have said.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.498
I would have given it to
you in the correct doses.

34:28.500 --> 34:32.168
I took it until the pain goes.
That's the correct dose.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.737
You could die if you take
too much of that stuff.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.572
Not too much of a threat
to a guy

34:35.574 --> 34:36.706
who has a terminal illness.

34:36.708 --> 34:37.774
You could have years.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.177
And how those years
I'm sure they'll be.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.279
- Gerry.
- No, look, Hayley.

34:43.482 --> 34:44.781
I assure you...

34:45.851 --> 34:49.453
dying is the last thing
I intend to do.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.837
They're coming to get you,
Barbara.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.218
Why are you sneaking up
on me for?

35:43.242 --> 35:44.741
This old piece of shit.

35:46.612 --> 35:47.644
Are you drunk?

35:48.914 --> 35:51.448
Why don't you ever watch
anything decent?

35:51.450 --> 35:52.883
Where did you get that bottle?

35:53.352 --> 35:55.272
Have you been hiding that
from us?

35:55.487 --> 35:57.487
I haven't had a real
drink in twelve months.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.755
I don't care.

35:59.625 --> 36:02.292
I really don't care about you
or your pal.

36:03.228 --> 36:06.229
I just wish you'd all fuck off
and die and leave me in peace.

36:06.231 --> 36:08.176
Why don't you go
and sleep this off?

36:08.200 --> 36:09.699
You're just wasting your time

36:09.701 --> 36:11.741
- with this piece of God damn-
- Hey, hey!

36:16.575 --> 36:19.242
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Huh? You're so depressed

36:19.244 --> 36:20.577
you want to bring
us all down with you?

36:20.579 --> 36:22.245
You want me to kill you,
you piece of shit?

36:22.247 --> 36:24.407
You want me to murder you,
is that what it is?

36:24.616 --> 36:27.250
Try it.
Kill me.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.320
And then see who
is going to interpret

36:30.322 --> 36:31.855
the data from the probe.

36:32.257 --> 36:34.624
Right now I am
the most important guy

36:34.626 --> 36:36.293
on this whole ship.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.661
I'll show you how important
you are.

36:37.663 --> 36:39.696
<i>Attention. Code Orange.</i>

36:39.932 --> 36:44.701
<i>Attention. Code Orange.
Attention. Code Orange.</i>

36:45.771 --> 36:46.836
It's not possible.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.772
- What is it?
- We're too far out.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.541
What's the problem?

36:52.678 --> 36:53.910
Captain to the Bridge.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.413
I repeat. Captain to the Bridge.
Code Orange.

36:56.415 --> 36:57.747
<i>We have a Code Orange.</i>

36:59.851 --> 37:02.485
Say again, Mike, it sounded
like you said code Orange.

37:03.222 --> 37:05.222
Confirmed, sir.
You heard me correctly.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.458
It just hit our scans now.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.794
Edge of our range.
Doesn't look like she's moving.

37:10.929 --> 37:11.995
Do you have a visual?

37:12.364 --> 37:13.563
I will if I swing us.

37:14.666 --> 37:17.434
All stop.
Meet me at the obs deck.

37:19.871 --> 37:23.573
What is it?
Are we about to explode?

37:23.575 --> 37:24.874
Are we on fire?

37:24.876 --> 37:25.842
Running out of air?

37:25.844 --> 37:27.277
Is there someone pregnant?

37:27.279 --> 37:29.913
Will you kindly inform me
what is happening?

37:29.915 --> 37:31.581
We have a Code Orange.

37:32.651 --> 37:35.619
What the fuck is a Code Orange?

37:35.621 --> 37:37.661
It means there's another ship
out there.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.716
I almost didn't believe it.

37:54.740 --> 37:55.839
I still can't.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.761
Believe it, sir. It's real.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.476
Pegasus, do we know who it is?

37:59.478 --> 38:00.844
<i>The ship does not have</i>

38:00.846 --> 38:03.013
<i>a functioning beacon
or signal transponder.</i>

38:03.015 --> 38:05.482
<i>It is a standard PT 32 design.</i>

38:05.484 --> 38:06.716
The same as us.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.838
That is the most common type
of scout ship.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.720
But one of ours off course?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.389
The only ship near was the Utah.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.658
There's no way it could
be one of ours gone off course.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.992
Pegasus, telescope.

38:16.595 --> 38:19.996
Coordinates eighty-seven.
Vector 12 A.

38:22.634 --> 38:23.700
Zoom.

38:24.569 --> 38:25.569
Enhance.

38:28.674 --> 38:31.641
Oh, great. It's a Chinese ship.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.876
How the hell are they here?

38:33.812 --> 38:36.379
They sent out the same scans
we did.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.848
Maybe they launched
a couple of months ahead of us.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.784
Which begs the question
why they stopped.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.986
They're right on the edge
of the system. Why not continue?

38:42.988 --> 38:44.688
Maybe they sent a probe
to the planet,

38:44.690 --> 38:46.089
proved it wasn't viable.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.724
They just figured
it wasn't worth it.

38:47.726 --> 38:48.725
Maybe they're making repairs.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.487
- Maybe they're dead.
- Hey.

38:51.596 --> 38:53.930
Maybe we should just stop
speculating. All right?

38:54.466 --> 38:55.932
Until we have a little bit
more information.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.294
Right now all we know is that
there is a ship out there.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.839
Mike, resume course.

39:03.608 --> 39:05.942
That'll swing us right by it
we can get a closer look.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.445
- Edward.
- Yes.

39:08.814 --> 39:10.013
Wake everyone up.

39:16.521 --> 39:17.620
So what if they're hostile?

39:17.622 --> 39:19.055
Okay. That's a possibility.

39:19.057 --> 39:20.824
I think we're too close to stop
now. I say keep going.

39:20.826 --> 39:22.559
That ship could have
every spare part

39:22.561 --> 39:24.094
we'd ever need.

39:24.096 --> 39:25.795
It could make our lives like a
hundred times easier. Come on.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.831
Exactly. And there are
certain medical supplies

39:27.833 --> 39:29.065
we seem to be running out of

39:29.067 --> 39:30.567
quicker than we should be.

39:30.569 --> 39:31.768
Captain,
whatever happened on that ship,

39:31.770 --> 39:33.103
to stop them
it could happen to us!

39:33.105 --> 39:34.137
Oh. Okay.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.638
Or the information on that ship

39:35.640 --> 39:37.223
could help us foresee
something...

39:37.224 --> 39:38.807
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
As feeling as that sounds

39:38.810 --> 39:41.678
I see no good in treading
in dead men's footsteps.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.912
But what if they need our help?

39:42.914 --> 39:44.681
Oh, fuck that.
Let's complete our mission,

39:44.683 --> 39:46.516
then we can circle back
and investigate

39:46.518 --> 39:48.062
if we have to head back
to the fleet.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.119
- We can't do that.
- All right.

39:49.121 --> 39:50.520
Oh, that's sure.

39:50.522 --> 39:51.821
The new world is just
around the corner.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.123
And you haven't even sent out
the probe.

39:53.125 --> 39:54.424
And then what the hell?

39:54.426 --> 39:55.925
You have some
revelation from God?

39:55.927 --> 39:56.893
We can't make it home.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.455
- What?
- Captain?

39:59.664 --> 40:02.899
The plasma overload last week
burnt 12 cubics of anti-matter.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.935
We'll use the reserve. Pete?

40:07.939 --> 40:09.439
- We already did.
- Oh, Jesus.

40:09.441 --> 40:10.807
What?

40:10.809 --> 40:12.175
Okay. Listen. We need anti
matter to make it back.

40:12.177 --> 40:13.810
That ship may have some.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.478
When the hell were you going
to let us know that?

40:15.480 --> 40:18.948
This is not a democracy, Gerry.
We're boarding that ship.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.684
We're going to help them
or ourselves or both.

40:21.686 --> 40:24.487
The information on that computer
is critical to us.

40:26.725 --> 40:27.924
We need this.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.427
We don't have a choice, guys.

40:42.507 --> 40:45.675
<i>Captain, all attempts
to hail the unidentified PT32</i>

40:45.677 --> 40:46.776
<i>have gone unanswered.</i>

40:47.979 --> 40:49.446
<i>I cannot sync
with their AI system,</i>

40:49.448 --> 40:51.681
<i>which is unusual.
It may be offline.</i>

40:52.751 --> 40:54.217
<i>Our approach course is set.</i>

40:54.619 --> 40:56.953
<i>And we will be ready
to dock within the hour.</i>

41:24.649 --> 41:26.149
<i>Guys, when we get in there</i>

41:26.151 --> 41:27.617
<i>we are going to head
straight to the computer area</i>

41:27.619 --> 41:29.185
<i>in the Bridge
and try to link up.</i>

41:29.187 --> 41:30.720
<i>Then I want you to go
to Engineering</i>

41:30.722 --> 41:32.188
<i>to figure out if
they've got any fuel left.</i>

41:32.190 --> 41:34.257
<i>Okay, Jane.
We're at the airlock.</i>

41:34.860 --> 41:35.992
<i>We're ready.</i>

41:35.994 --> 41:37.861
Copy, that. Good luck, boys.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.817
<i>Jon to Jane.</i>

42:00.819 --> 42:02.852
<i>Seal the airlock.
We're on the Chinese ship.</i>

42:02.854 --> 42:04.020
<i>Seal the hatch.</i>

42:41.793 --> 42:44.761
<i>Jane, hull integrity
of the unidentified PT 32</i>

42:44.763 --> 42:46.095
<i>is at 62%.</i>

42:46.097 --> 42:48.097
<i>Protocol recommends
we seal the airlock,</i>

42:48.099 --> 42:49.799
<i>and retract the docking corridor</i>

42:49.801 --> 42:51.935
<i>while the away team
complete their mission.</i>

42:51.937 --> 42:53.202
<i>Correction.</i>

42:53.204 --> 42:55.338
<i>Whole integrity
of the unidentified PT32</i>

42:55.340 --> 42:57.707
<i>is now at 61%.</i>

43:04.649 --> 43:07.150
<i>I don't like this.
Where the hell is everyone?</i>

43:10.855 --> 43:11.821
<i>We should have come across</i>

43:11.823 --> 43:13.089
<i>a couple of bodies at least.</i>

43:16.061 --> 43:19.596
<i>Keep it together, guys.
Pete, go and check in there.</i>

43:20.198 --> 43:21.798
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

43:23.268 --> 43:24.801
<i>Meet us on the Bridge.</i>

43:57.969 --> 44:00.370
<i>Nothing but rotten food
in here, Captain.</i>

44:12.851 --> 44:14.971
<i>Can you get a read down
over here?</i>

44:16.154 --> 44:17.674
<i>Copy.</i>

44:25.897 --> 44:27.737
<i>It's all in Chinese.</i>

44:30.935 --> 44:33.736
<i>I'm assuming their system
read outs are the same as ours,</i>

44:34.706 --> 44:37.240
<i>which case it looks like
we got good atmosphere pressure,</i>

44:38.743 --> 44:40.410
<i>environment is a little hot,
but we do have oxygen.</i>

44:40.412 --> 44:41.944
<i>We should be able to breathe.</i>

44:42.681 --> 44:44.258
<i>So we could take these off?</i>

44:44.282 --> 44:46.816
<i>Yeah, sure. After you.</i>

45:05.804 --> 45:06.969
Okay.

45:06.971 --> 45:10.406
I need you to get
the main engine power back on

45:11.276 --> 45:12.975
so we can get the computer
back online.

45:12.977 --> 45:16.379
Okay, all right.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.954
- Voila.
- Ah, it's good stuff.

45:26.958 --> 45:30.326
Okay. I'm going to see
if I can access their logs,

45:31.196 --> 45:32.428
figure out what happened.

45:32.864 --> 45:34.063
Head to Engineering and see

45:34.065 --> 45:35.331
if that there's anything
that we can salvage.

45:35.333 --> 45:36.999
Mike, I need you to figure out

45:37.001 --> 45:39.502
how and when they got here
and how long they'd been here.

46:10.502 --> 46:11.934
How's your Chinese?

46:12.403 --> 46:13.803
It's been a while
since I needed it.

46:13.805 --> 46:15.271
Yeah, same here.

46:15.440 --> 46:19.408
Well, at least the ships
are the same

46:19.410 --> 46:21.077
so the controls are identical.

46:21.346 --> 46:22.812
Yeah, all made in Taiwan.

46:25.016 --> 46:26.382
Hayley speaks some Chinese.

46:27.252 --> 46:28.551
I'm hoping
she can translate them,

46:28.553 --> 46:30.513
but we've got to find
the logs first.

46:31.556 --> 46:36.125
No crew. No sign of life.

46:37.162 --> 46:39.295
Is this what happened to her?

46:44.202 --> 46:46.122
I think I've got something.

46:53.344 --> 46:54.443
Huh.

47:31.583 --> 47:32.849
That's it?

47:33.952 --> 47:35.151
It's the last one.

47:35.553 --> 47:37.498
He doesn't look worried
or anything.

47:37.522 --> 47:38.888
He seemed concerned.

47:40.191 --> 47:42.925
Maybe whatever happened,
they didn't know it was coming.

47:44.529 --> 47:46.295
How are you coming
with the transport logs?

47:46.297 --> 47:47.463
Not good.

47:47.465 --> 47:48.965
All the file headings
are in Chinese.

47:48.967 --> 47:50.499
I'm going to have to go
through them one by one.

47:50.501 --> 47:53.870
Okay. Upload them to Pegasus.

47:54.205 --> 47:56.339
We'll get Hayley started
on the translation.

47:56.341 --> 47:58.174
- I'm doing it now.
- Okay.

48:08.887 --> 48:09.887
What?

48:11.022 --> 48:12.655
- Somebody else is on this ship.
- What?

48:12.657 --> 48:16.425
- Someone else is on this ship.
- Who?

48:16.427 --> 48:18.094
I don't know who,

48:18.263 --> 48:20.062
but I've seen enough
scary movies

48:20.064 --> 48:21.530
in my time to know not to go

48:21.532 --> 48:24.433
and investigate the loud noise.
I thought I'd swing back,

48:25.069 --> 48:26.102
grab some of my friends

48:26.104 --> 48:28.024
and we can all go
and take a look.

48:28.172 --> 48:31.974
I'll check the internal sensors.
Offline, great.

48:32.310 --> 48:33.943
Okay. We're blind here, guys.

48:37.415 --> 48:38.981
We have to do a sweep.

48:44.656 --> 48:45.955
Stay close. Let's go.

48:51.963 --> 48:53.596
<i>Jane.
Pete was able to get</i>

48:53.598 --> 48:55.498
<i>the Dragon's AI unit
up and running.</i>

48:55.500 --> 48:57.033
<i>I am now connected to it.</i>

48:58.469 --> 49:00.949
<i>Hayley, Mike has sent over
some files for you to translate.</i>

49:01.005 --> 49:03.506
<i>Many of the Dragon's systems
are still offline,</i>

49:03.508 --> 49:05.441
<i>including the internal sensors.</i>

49:06.411 --> 49:10.112
<i>The Captain has now ordered
to ship to ship radio silence.</i>

49:10.415 --> 49:13.015
<i>They have a code 7 situation
on board.</i>

49:16.988 --> 49:18.187
Mike, watch your six.

49:18.556 --> 49:19.556
I've got it, Cap.

49:31.269 --> 49:33.229
I thought
we checked the whole ship.

49:33.504 --> 49:34.637
Obviously not.

49:39.610 --> 49:41.110
Are you sure you saw something?

49:41.112 --> 49:42.478
I'm sure I saw something.

49:45.083 --> 49:46.749
I've never seen you run so fast,
Pete.

49:46.751 --> 49:47.751
Hey, you know what?

49:48.753 --> 49:50.119
You don't believe me,

49:50.121 --> 49:51.699
why don't you run ahead
and take a look?

49:51.723 --> 49:53.055
What was it?

49:53.524 --> 49:55.324
I didn't get a good look. Okay?

49:55.326 --> 49:58.361
But it was like some
like craze maniac,

49:58.363 --> 50:00.229
like 6 feet
or something like that.

50:00.231 --> 50:01.364
Six feet?

50:09.574 --> 50:10.639
It's in engineering.

50:12.410 --> 50:13.509
Pete, it's the Engineering...

50:13.511 --> 50:15.745
Okay. Okay. Okay. I see it.

50:16.147 --> 50:17.380
It's just in here.

50:19.484 --> 50:20.484
You wanna go first?

50:21.152 --> 50:22.385
You got it.

50:23.755 --> 50:25.121
Yeah. Okay.

51:28.419 --> 51:30.152
Jesus. He's only a kid.

51:31.322 --> 51:33.202
Probably Pete's
six foot monster.

51:33.758 --> 51:36.158
- He knocked you over, didn't he?
- I tripped.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.126
Of course you did.

51:37.128 --> 51:38.594
Hopefully he's got some answers.

51:40.832 --> 51:42.331
I got him.

51:49.307 --> 51:50.406
Let's go.

52:07.158 --> 52:08.224
Six feet, huh?

52:08.759 --> 52:10.159
I don't want to talk about it.

52:10.428 --> 52:11.827
Is that what you call backup?

52:11.829 --> 52:14.597
It was leadership
skill that made me warn you.

52:15.533 --> 52:16.499
Hey, Captain.

52:16.501 --> 52:17.501
Yeah.

52:17.869 --> 52:19.368
Me and Mike were wondering...

52:19.370 --> 52:20.636
if anything happened to you,

52:21.205 --> 52:23.405
who would you want
to take command of the ship?

52:24.375 --> 52:25.641
You know, in the event of
something going bad, who...?

52:25.643 --> 52:26.909
Captain.
Actually Pete was wondering.

52:26.911 --> 52:28.210
I know the answer to that
already.

52:28.212 --> 52:29.311
Oh, what I was saying

52:29.313 --> 52:30.546
is I assumed you would be,
you know,

52:30.548 --> 52:32.281
the person that knows
the most about the ship.

52:32.283 --> 52:35.651
I would base it completely on
looks, guys. Bridge, come in.

52:35.653 --> 52:37.319
<i>Bridge, here.
What's happening, Captain?</i>

52:37.321 --> 52:39.555
We found a survivor,
a small Chinese boy.

52:39.557 --> 52:41.257
Yeah, Jane. But the airlock
is not working.

52:41.259 --> 52:42.658
Can you unlock it from your end?

52:42.660 --> 52:44.527
<i>There's no problem on this end.</i>

52:44.529 --> 52:46.295
Pegasus, release the airlock.

52:46.664 --> 52:48.497
<i>Outer airlock has been sealed.</i>

52:48.499 --> 52:50.399
<i>Override must be
manually entered.</i>

52:50.401 --> 52:51.934
I'm afraid that would be me.

52:52.570 --> 52:53.702
What do you mean?

52:53.938 --> 52:56.305
<i>Captain, I locked it.</i>

52:57.208 --> 52:58.908
<i>In case any survivors
from the Chinese ship</i>

52:58.910 --> 53:00.676
try to gain access
to the Pegasus.

53:00.678 --> 53:03.646
Yeah. Well, it's just us and
a boy. So you can let us in.

53:03.915 --> 53:05.181
<i>I can't risk it.</i>

53:06.784 --> 53:08.484
<i>We don't want whatever happens
over there happening in here.</i>

53:08.486 --> 53:09.919
<i>You're just going to have
to stay there</i>

53:09.921 --> 53:11.520
until we understand
what's going on.

53:11.522 --> 53:12.922
<i>Open that fucking door, Edward.</i>

53:12.924 --> 53:14.868
<i>Edward, it's just us.
There's no risk.</i>

53:14.892 --> 53:17.726
Open the door.
That's a direct command.

53:17.862 --> 53:19.595
<i>Captain, with you
and Mike off the ship,</i>

53:19.597 --> 53:22.598
I'm the next person in command.
And I will not risk it.

53:23.367 --> 53:25.734
You guys shouldn't
even have removed your helmets.

53:26.437 --> 53:28.237
We don't know what happened
to the crew over there.

53:28.239 --> 53:29.605
We don't know if they got sick.

53:30.541 --> 53:33.309
You have endangered
the entire mission by-

53:41.285 --> 53:42.551
I thought he'd never shut up.

53:42.552 --> 53:44.912
<i>Just hoping Edward
calm down a little, sir.</i>

53:45.323 --> 53:46.622
Hayley.

53:49.961 --> 53:51.927
Manually reversing override.

53:51.929 --> 53:53.495
<i>Airlock opened.</i>

53:57.335 --> 53:59.213
Based on looks, you hear that?

53:59.237 --> 54:00.536
Yes, so that means me.

54:00.538 --> 54:01.538
You wish.

54:03.975 --> 54:06.809
You have endangered our lives
by doing this.

54:06.811 --> 54:08.877
You should have left him over
there to die. You know what?

54:08.879 --> 54:11.947
Better yet, you should have
finished the job yourselves.

54:11.949 --> 54:13.482
He is just a child,
for goodness sake.

54:13.484 --> 54:15.317
Would you happily have
Lila killed, just as easy?

54:15.319 --> 54:16.819
- That is different.
- How come?

54:16.821 --> 54:19.822
Lila is not our enemy.
His people are.

54:19.824 --> 54:21.023
It's exactly the attitude
that got us here

54:21.025 --> 54:22.291
in the first place.

54:22.293 --> 54:25.628
Well. You know what?
Like it or not, we are here.

54:25.630 --> 54:27.896
And his people are after
the same thing we are.

54:27.898 --> 54:30.566
You know,
I highly, highly doubt that

54:30.568 --> 54:32.268
two flags
are going to be planted

54:32.270 --> 54:33.435
in the same sand together.

54:33.437 --> 54:35.537
Hayley! What can you tell me
about him?

54:35.539 --> 54:36.505
Not a great deal.

54:36.507 --> 54:39.341
He is between four
and six years old,

54:39.677 --> 54:41.644
malnourished,
poor state of hygiene.

54:42.380 --> 54:45.014
Severely traumatized by whatever
happened on that ship or

54:45.349 --> 54:46.715
the sheer fact
that he's been there

54:46.717 --> 54:47.950
for however long.

54:47.952 --> 54:49.051
He is sedated now.

54:49.053 --> 54:50.973
I'll talk to him
when he wakes up.

54:51.822 --> 54:52.655
<i>Captain, I have Pete
wanting to speak with you</i>

54:52.657 --> 54:53.657
<i>from the Dragon.</i>

54:53.758 --> 54:55.424
Go ahead, Pete.

54:55.426 --> 54:57.059
Captain, I've checked the
anti-matter supply over here.

54:57.061 --> 54:58.994
There's hardly anything left.

54:59.497 --> 55:01.408
Nowhere near
what we need to get home.

55:01.432 --> 55:02.531
Are you sure?

55:03.734 --> 55:05.774
<i>A hundred percent.
Checked it twice.</i>

55:06.437 --> 55:07.681
<i>Looks like they didn't leave
anything for the trip home.</i>

55:07.705 --> 55:08.937
Copy that.

55:09.907 --> 55:11.507
<i>I'm sending Mike over now.</i>

55:11.509 --> 55:13.642
<i>Strip down everything
that's not nailed down.</i>

55:13.644 --> 55:15.511
<i>As soon as you guys are done,
we're heading out.</i>

55:15.513 --> 55:16.845
Roger.

55:17.581 --> 55:19.948
You're happy? Fucking wonderful!

55:22.586 --> 55:24.553
Can you believe all the cool
stuff they had it here?

55:24.555 --> 55:26.355
You definitely checked
all their reserves. Right?

55:26.357 --> 55:28.324
I checked it
and I checked it twice.

55:28.326 --> 55:30.859
Look just accept it bud,
theirs was a one way trip.

55:31.429 --> 55:32.628
Hey, you think they knew
something we don't?

55:32.630 --> 55:33.962
Yeah. Get to the planet.

55:33.964 --> 55:35.884
Claim it
before the westerners do.

55:36.767 --> 55:38.534
Right, come on.
Let's get this out of here.

55:38.536 --> 55:39.968
Yeah. Good idea, mate.

55:39.970 --> 55:41.837
Because I just removed
all the isotope guards.

55:43.441 --> 55:44.506
I can feel the heat already.
What's going to happen?

55:44.508 --> 55:45.908
Well mate,
in a couple of minutes

55:45.910 --> 55:48.010
the ship won't be here.
I'll see you back on board.

55:48.012 --> 55:49.445
All right?
You hang back for a bit.

55:49.447 --> 55:50.879
Hey, man, that's not funny.

55:53.117 --> 55:55.477
I think he would have
made me captain eventually.

55:55.786 --> 55:57.019
No, he would have done.

55:57.021 --> 55:58.087
You can even get there
with the open door.

55:58.089 --> 56:00.033
That was because
I was letting you,

56:00.057 --> 56:01.824
- like audition for the role.
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

56:01.826 --> 56:03.625
- I was feeling sorry for you.
- Yeah.

56:03.627 --> 56:05.094
- Oh, crap.
- What?

56:05.096 --> 56:06.462
I've left my pad behind.
Here, take this.

56:06.464 --> 56:07.529
Oh, forget it.
We ain't got time.

56:07.531 --> 56:08.831
Oh, we've gotten minutes.

56:08.833 --> 56:10.099
I thought you said the ship
was going to blow.

56:10.101 --> 56:11.734
In ten minutes.
I'll meet you on the bridge.

56:11.736 --> 56:13.569
- It won't be a minute.
- All right. Be quick.

56:13.571 --> 56:14.603
I will.

56:28.919 --> 56:29.885
Pete to Bridge.

56:29.887 --> 56:31.053
Go ahead, Pete.

56:32.556 --> 56:34.134
<i>Jane,
the airlock is sealed again.</i>

56:34.158 --> 56:35.824
Pete, are you still over there?

56:35.826 --> 56:37.393
<i>Yeah. And I'd really like
to get off about now.</i>

56:37.395 --> 56:38.827
No one over here has touched it.

56:39.130 --> 56:40.396
Edward.

56:40.398 --> 56:41.875
No, he's still out
in the Medi-bay.

56:41.899 --> 56:44.099
Pegasus, who ordered
the airlock be sealed?

56:44.101 --> 56:46.261
<i>Jane.
It was The Dragon herself.</i>

56:50.107 --> 56:51.940
<i>Hull breach.</i>

56:51.942 --> 56:54.810
<i>Emergency airlock containment
procedure initiated.</i>

56:54.812 --> 56:55.978
What the hell was that?

56:55.980 --> 56:56.845
Some sort of explosion
in the airlock.

56:56.847 --> 56:57.946
Are we still secure?

56:57.948 --> 56:59.815
Inner door is sealed
and intact...

56:59.817 --> 57:02.151
- Outer door is fucked.
- He's still over there.

57:02.153 --> 57:03.685
What do you mean
Pete's still over there?

57:03.687 --> 57:04.653
In the other ship.
He went back to get something.

57:04.655 --> 57:06.054
Now he's fucking trapped.

57:06.056 --> 57:08.090
Pete, how long you have
before that engine goes bad?

57:08.092 --> 57:09.425
About seven minutes.

57:09.593 --> 57:10.993
Okay, Pete.
You need to listen to me.

57:10.995 --> 57:12.828
You get yourself
into a spacesuit

57:12.830 --> 57:14.029
and you can space walk across.

57:14.031 --> 57:15.497
There's no good.
We left all the spacesuits

57:15.499 --> 57:17.466
and the helmets
on the Pegasus for spares.

57:17.468 --> 57:18.500
Shit yeah that's right.

57:18.502 --> 57:20.046
Okay. Okay, Pete.
Listen up.

57:20.070 --> 57:21.804
I'm going to move us over
close to you.

57:21.806 --> 57:23.205
You open
your airlock door anyway.

57:23.207 --> 57:25.073
The explosive decompression
will throw you over to us.

57:25.075 --> 57:27.476
<i>You can survive in space
a few seconds without a suit.</i>

57:27.478 --> 57:29.211
When he gets across,
how do we let him back in?

57:29.213 --> 57:31.213
The outer airlock door
is hanging off.

57:31.215 --> 57:32.848
If we open the inner one
we lose the atmosphere

57:32.850 --> 57:33.949
from the whole ship.

57:33.951 --> 57:35.584
We'll lock down
the whole section.

57:35.586 --> 57:36.552
No, no, no, guys, guys.
That's going to take too long.

57:36.554 --> 57:37.653
It's going to be manual override

57:37.655 --> 57:38.754
and once we vent out
the atmosphere

57:38.756 --> 57:40.022
- it'll blast him back. Pete.
- Yeah.

57:40.024 --> 57:41.790
<i>I need you to get
to the escape pod</i>

57:41.792 --> 57:43.637
<i>and we'll pick you up
after launch.</i>

57:43.661 --> 57:44.661
Okay. On it.

57:45.663 --> 57:46.795
- Mike.
- Cap?

57:46.797 --> 57:47.896
Get to the Med Bay,
check on Edward,

57:47.898 --> 57:49.031
make sure
he's still unconscious,

57:49.033 --> 57:51.033
and make sure that Hayley
has the boy.

57:51.635 --> 57:53.235
Jane, move us away
from the ship.

57:53.237 --> 57:55.137
- Mike, get a weapon.
- Got it.

57:55.706 --> 57:57.105
Sir, shouldn't we wait?

57:57.541 --> 57:58.807
Jane, just do it.

57:58.809 --> 58:01.109
<i>Warning.
The Dragon's antimatter chamber</i>

58:01.111 --> 58:03.479
<i>is destabilizing.</i>

58:03.481 --> 58:05.881
<i>Warning. Pegasus is within
predicted blast radius.</i>

58:26.704 --> 58:27.903
Still no pod launch.

58:27.905 --> 58:29.985
Come on, Pete.
What the hell is he doing?

58:59.270 --> 59:00.736
<i>No escape pod.</i>

59:01.305 --> 59:02.771
Pete.

59:02.773 --> 59:05.574
<i>It's okay.
I know what has to happen.</i>

59:05.776 --> 59:06.708
I'm sorry.

59:06.710 --> 59:09.111
<i>Me too. Listen...</i>

59:09.113 --> 59:11.179
The oxy-generation units,

59:11.181 --> 59:13.749
they need pressure releasing
every three to four weeks

59:14.218 --> 59:15.751
<i>otherwise the valve blows.</i>

59:15.753 --> 59:17.019
<i>And we don't have
too many valves left.</i>

59:17.021 --> 59:18.654
<i>And if you need the valves,</i>

59:18.656 --> 59:21.001
<i>they're actually in the
maintenance cabinet in my room.</i>

59:21.025 --> 59:22.591
Pete.

59:22.593 --> 59:25.160
Listen, because you need to know
some of this stuff.

59:25.162 --> 59:26.562
The Medi-bay:

59:26.564 --> 59:27.996
The emergency batteries
in the Medi-bay

59:27.998 --> 59:30.599
are actually currently powering
the water recyc system.

59:30.601 --> 59:32.668
<i>Ah, so if you need the Medi-bay,</i>

59:32.937 --> 59:34.303
<i>for someone's appendix
or something like that,</i>

59:34.305 --> 59:36.004
<i>you need to manually switch it.</i>

59:37.575 --> 59:38.774
It's been an honor, Pete.

59:40.811 --> 59:41.910
Likewise.

59:44.615 --> 59:48.684
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

59:49.887 --> 59:51.219
I shouldn't have let you
go back.

59:51.221 --> 59:53.589
<i>Hey, hey, shut up.</i>

59:54.291 --> 59:56.251
<i>There's nothing
to apologize for.</i>

59:56.293 --> 59:58.126
<i>You take care of yourself,
all right mate?</i>

59:58.128 --> 01:00:01.229
- Pete.
<i>- Hey, hey scamp.</i>

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.739
<i>Please come back, Pete.</i>

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:17.179
Oh, I want to, but I can't.

01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:19.715
There's been an accident
and I'm stuck over here.

01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:22.951
It's really silly.
But, listen.

01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:26.154
<i>Everything's going
to be okay because Hayley is-</i>

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:27.856
What's going to happen?

01:00:28.158 --> 01:00:29.625
<i>Ok...</i>

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.161
<i>in about a minute
I'm going to die.</i>

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:37.032
<i>But listen.
It's going to be very quick</i>

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.635
<i>and it's okay because
for that minute</i>

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:40.936
<i>I get to talk to you.</i>

01:00:41.772 --> 01:00:43.171
<i>And I get to tell you that...</i>

01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:46.875
<i>I get to tell you
that I love you very, very much.</i>

01:00:49.013 --> 01:00:52.147
<i>And I'm so happy because you,</i>

01:00:53.717 --> 01:00:55.757
because you're going to go see
the ocean

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.120
and I helped you get there.

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:04.126
Don't be sad, baby.

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:12.300
I love you very much.
And I need you to...

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:14.222
I need you to keep a secret
for me.

01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:15.738
Can you do that?

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:20.842
<i>Okay, lean real, real close,
real close to the monitor.</i>

01:01:22.913 --> 01:01:24.146
I need you to tell Hayley

01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:25.247
that I'm sorry
I didn't tell her everything

01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:26.682
I should have already told her.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.184
<i>Okay.</i>

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:30.306
<i>Can you do that for me?</i>

01:01:31.755 --> 01:01:33.055
<i>I haven't got very long.</i>

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:35.891
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:01:37.428 --> 01:01:38.427
Don't be sad, baby.

01:01:38.429 --> 01:01:41.963
Everything's going to be okay.
I lo-

01:01:53.744 --> 01:01:54.810
I love you.

01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:11.159
What did I tell you, Captain?

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:15.230
I warned you
about meddling with the Chinese.

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:17.392
No one could have predicted
this would happen.

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:21.303
Well, I'm glad that
you would think so.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.006
Because we just lost
the only man

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:26.942
that could keep
this ship running.

01:02:26.944 --> 01:02:30.045
Fortunately now,
we're in the system.

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:36.184
I don't know how else this
crate is going to keep going.

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:58.473
Mike, change out the suit.
Jane, get us back on course.

01:03:36.947 --> 01:03:39.414
<i>Replaying now 8470.</i>

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:41.850
<i>All right, I'm removing
the last screw now.</i>

01:03:44.454 --> 01:03:45.337
<i>Make sure you keep a hold of it.</i>

01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:46.221
<i>Relax, man.
These are steady hands.</i>

01:03:46.223 --> 01:03:47.422
<i>I just don't want
to lose any if we can help it.</i>

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:50.292
<i>Yeah, there is already
enough screws loose around here.</i>

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:53.028
<i>Michael,
are you disparaging the sanity</i>

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:54.396
<i>of certain crew
members on board,</i>

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:55.964
<i>or are you making
libelous insinuations</i>

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:57.499
<i>about the stability of my ship?</i>

01:03:57.501 --> 01:04:01.369
<i>Your ship? Fuck you, man.
This ship, sweetheart, is mine.</i>

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:03.883
<i>Woah, woah, woah, fly boy.</i>

01:04:03.907 --> 01:04:05.841
<i>Anybody can point this crate
in a direction</i>

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:07.342
<i>and press the button marked "Go"</i>

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:08.910
<i>but it takes a genius,
and let's not forget, Mike,</i>

01:04:08.912 --> 01:04:10.612
<i>- I'm a genius, to keep her:</i>
Are you okay?

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:12.247
<i>A moving and B,
from falling apart.</i>

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:14.149
<i>All right? That makes it mine.</i>

01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:16.418
<i>Sorry to interrupt you ladies,
but this crate,</i>

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:19.521
<i>as you so elegantly call it,
Pete, is mine.</i>

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:21.923
<i>- Captain.
- Whose ship is it?</i>

01:04:22.259 --> 01:04:23.959
<i>Jon's ship Jon's ship</i>

01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:26.461
<i>Good girls. Now, how much
longer on this work?</i>

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:28.330
<i>I'm just installing
the new valve now.</i>

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:30.332
<i>Copy that.
Quick as you can, gentlemen.</i>

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:32.167
<i>I want engines
restarted inside of an hour.</i>

01:04:32.169 --> 01:04:33.501
<i>There's a desk cloud
headed this way</i>

01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:35.036
<i>that'll require more
than a valve</i>

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.304
<i>being fixed if it hits us.</i>

01:04:37.641 --> 01:04:39.908
<i>Understood, sir.
Moving double quick.</i>

01:04:40.611 --> 01:04:41.691
<i>Where were we?</i>

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.424
<i>Let me just make sure
he's not still listening.</i>

01:04:44.448 --> 01:04:46.982
<i>Captain? Ok, yes.</i>

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:49.885
<i>Where were we?
This ship, Mike, is mine,</i>

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:51.887
<i>because I'm the one that keeps
it from falling apart</i>

01:04:51.889 --> 01:04:54.522
<i>every time somebody called Mike
takes us too close to a star</i>

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:56.958
<i>or an asteroid belt
or into a black hole</i>

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.260
<i>or whatever it is
you joyriders do</i>

01:04:58.262 --> 01:04:59.928
<i>when you're fumbling
at those controls.</i>

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:01.396
<i>Woah, woah,
she may not be falling apart</i>

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:02.364
<i>but you sure ain't the one
out here</i>

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:03.465
<i>fixing her right now</i>.

01:05:03.467 --> 01:05:04.466
<i>Well, delegation of duties</i>

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.034
<i>is part of my job, you see.</i>

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:07.435
<i>There's no point
in risking me going outside</i>

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:08.904
<i>to fix a plasma valve</i>

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:10.238
<i>when I can talk
you through it, Mike.</i>

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.040
<i>This is a job
a seven-year-old could do.</i>

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:13.308
<i>Oh, well. Next time why
don't you just send Lila?</i>

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:14.676
<i>The suits are too big for her.</i>

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:16.077
<i>Besides which
we're supposed to only send</i>

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.457
<i>expendable members
of crew outside.</i>

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:18.446
How are you feeling?

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:19.581
I'll live.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.417
You hit me really hard.

01:05:25.055 --> 01:05:27.095
We weren't supposed
to let them on board.

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:29.197
- Just obeying regulations.
- Pete's dead.

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.160
What?

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:35.297
Huh, how did that happen?

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:36.698
Will you please stop talking?

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.173
Listen to me.

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:46.975
Listen to me.

01:05:46.977 --> 01:05:48.643
Listen to me. Calm down.

01:05:48.645 --> 01:05:52.414
Do you speak English?

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:55.984
Call the captain.

01:05:55.986 --> 01:06:00.255
<i>Security breach.
Medical Bay. Security breach.</i>

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.692
<i>Medical Bay. Security breach.</i>

01:06:03.694 --> 01:06:08.096
<i>Medical Bay. Security breach.
Medical Bay.</i>

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:17.473
It's okay.

01:06:49.072 --> 01:06:51.032
Find out what happened
to his ship.

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:54.502
And don't let him
out of your sight.

01:06:59.049 --> 01:07:00.049
Or him.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:23.605
She is dead.

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.576
Does that mean
I'm not hallucinating?

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:34.115
Come on.
You know better than all that.

01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:37.819
I could be dead and you
could still be hallucinating me.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:40.422
Great.

01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:43.792
Best of both worlds.

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:47.062
Everyone should prepare
for death.

01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:21.129
Please.

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:48.423
Jay.

01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:49.491
Lila.

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:05.608
How was he?

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:07.442
Sleeping.

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:09.377
Get anything out of him?

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:11.813
Not a lot.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.515
My Chinese isn't great

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:15.550
and even when I used
the translation programs

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:19.154
there were still questions
that he didn't want to answer.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:24.792
I asked him about his parents
and the other people on the ship

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:26.227
and still nothing.

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:31.198
Something really traumatic
must have happened on that ship.

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:34.169
But he doesn't want to tell me.

01:09:37.807 --> 01:09:41.442
Yeah. Mike and Edward
found the flight log.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:47.314
Pete... Pete was right.

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:49.991
They didn't save everything
from the return flight.

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:52.386
They burned out
everything they had

01:09:52.389 --> 01:09:54.349
to get here
a few months ahead of us.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.793
The escape pod
was launched six months ago.

01:10:00.597 --> 01:10:02.297
The boy has been on his own
for that long.

01:10:02.299 --> 01:10:04.199
No wonder he's so feral.

01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:07.402
You know the weird thing
is in the weeks that followed

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:09.504
after they launched
the escape pod,

01:10:10.473 --> 01:10:13.408
the airlock opened like five
or six times,

01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:14.976
but no ships docked.

01:10:15.812 --> 01:10:17.478
He must have tried
to kill himself,

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.681
but couldn't go through with it.

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:22.417
<i>Captain.</i>

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:25.720
Go ahead.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:26.688
<i>We're now within range
of the planet.</i>

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:27.922
<i>Edward has confirmed</i>

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:29.908
<i>that the probe
is ready to launch.</i>

01:10:29.909 --> 01:10:32.069
Thank you. Tell Edward
to launch immediately.

01:10:39.603 --> 01:10:41.683
<i>Probe's launched successfully.</i>

01:10:42.806 --> 01:10:44.372
It all comes down to this.

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:47.842
Yeah.

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:54.549
Do you think we'll make it?

01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:00.855
Yeah, I do.

01:11:04.461 --> 01:11:05.627
I don't.

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:20.875
On the lower screen?

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:22.277
Yeah, I see it.

01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:23.411
You call it for me?

01:11:23.413 --> 01:11:24.812
It can't be
about the probe already.

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:28.316
It's too early for that.
We've got news of another one.

01:11:28.485 --> 01:11:29.717
The Chinese probe.

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:30.885
What about it?

01:11:31.054 --> 01:11:32.820
According to their computer,

01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:34.922
the probe was sent out

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:37.325
a couple of hours before
their escape pod was launched,

01:11:37.661 --> 01:11:39.327
only to a different address.

01:11:39.329 --> 01:11:40.828
What do you mean
a different address?

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:42.497
The system doesn't have
just one planet

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:43.431
in the habitable zone.

01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:44.433
It has two.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:46.061
They occupy the same orbit.

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:48.836
The telescopic scans confused
the one with the other.

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:49.937
Do you know what this means?

01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:52.340
Two potentially
habitable planets.

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:53.875
We just doubled our chances.

01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:57.445
Have you received any data
transmission from the probe?

01:11:57.447 --> 01:11:58.479
After they launched

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.326
their ship drifted out of range.

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:02.470
The probe should
have transmitted, but look.

01:12:02.886 --> 01:12:04.806
They never received
the telemetry.

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:07.588
We're a lot closer
into the system,

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:09.524
so when we launch our probe...

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:12.593
So we should start to receive
the data transmission then.

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:13.961
I think we will.

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:18.399
Right now that second
planet is behind their Sun.

01:12:18.802 --> 01:12:21.703
And if my calculations are right
then in a couple of days

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:23.771
that planet should just pop
right out,

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:25.039
will be in line the sight,

01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:28.076
and we'll be able to receive
the transmissions

01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:29.610
from the Chinese probe.

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:32.987
We get two rolls of the dice,
gentlemen.

01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:36.584
For now we wait.

01:12:59.642 --> 01:13:01.722
Penny for
your thoughts, Captain.

01:13:03.413 --> 01:13:05.380
You know what I'm thinking,
Captain.

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:09.851
Always. Your crew don't see it,

01:13:09.853 --> 01:13:12.453
but I can feel the sadness
washing over you

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:13.721
like waves on a beach.

01:13:15.692 --> 01:13:18.760
You're thinking how old
my children would be

01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:22.663
if we'd gone ahead
as originally planned.

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:27.402
I wonder who they
would have gone with.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:28.669
You're hoping you.

01:13:29.406 --> 01:13:30.905
I'm alive.

01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:33.408
Did she draw the short straw?

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:39.947
Did her crew mutiny
and kill her? And the child?

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:42.884
Did she kill herself?

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:46.821
Maybe I killed him.

01:13:47.023 --> 01:13:48.823
That's what being Captain means.

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:52.760
Taking difficult decisions
and sticking with them.

01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.767
I know what it takes
to be a Captain.

01:14:03.473 --> 01:14:07.542
Captain?
Are you awake?

01:14:10.547 --> 01:14:11.979
Yeah. Everything is fine.

01:14:11.981 --> 01:14:13.481
Go back to bed.

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.510
<i>Locker code expired.</i>

01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:17.245
<i>Medical officer Hayley Matthews,</i>

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:19.947
<i>please enter
updated access code.</i>

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:27.555
<i>Locker code accepted.
Captain Jon Dale</i>

01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:39.801
Oh.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:59.173
Hey! Hey, what? No, fuck!

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:02.410
God! Oh, fuck! Shit! God!

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:11.719
What did you do?
What the hell did you do to him?

01:18:11.988 --> 01:18:13.254
What are you talking about?

01:18:13.723 --> 01:18:16.323
We were drinking...
watching a movie...

01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:18.926
We had a drink.
I found him like that!

01:18:19.295 --> 01:18:21.195
Oh, my God.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:22.930
Pegasus,
who else has been in here?

01:18:22.932 --> 01:18:24.432
<i>Warning.</i>

01:18:24.434 --> 01:18:26.715
<i>Main frame breach
in Engineering. I cannot help.</i>

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:28.703
Where the hell is Lila?

01:18:28.705 --> 01:18:30.905
Damn it! I knew
this was going to happen.

01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:32.127
We have to find the boy.

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:39.447
God. Mike.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:42.483
God.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.400
<i>Warning. Security
breach.</i>

01:18:59.402 --> 01:19:01.402
<i>My program
is being tampered with.</i>

01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:03.524
<i>The only access point
is in Engineering.</i>

01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:07.942
Hey.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:09.443
Let me talk to him.

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:17.451
He said he didn't do it.

01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:18.819
Yeah. Of course he'd say that.

01:19:18.821 --> 01:19:20.187
But nobody was dying
till he showed up.

01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:21.789
He's just a boy.

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:22.890
You know what?
Mike was sleeping.

01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:24.358
And even a boy can cut a throat

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.392
if someone's sleeping.

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:28.496
And it takes a special
kind of boy, doesn't it?

01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:31.198
I agree. It's him.

01:19:35.004 --> 01:19:38.172
You must know.
Where is she? Where is Lila?

01:19:38.374 --> 01:19:39.406
Here I am.

01:19:39.942 --> 01:19:41.308
Oh, my God.

01:19:43.846 --> 01:19:45.079
Are you okay?

01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:47.092
Yes.
We were playing hide-and-seek.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.549
When did you last see him?

01:19:49.018 --> 01:19:50.184
He just got here.

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:52.019
He was supposed
to be looking for me,

01:19:52.021 --> 01:19:53.387
not hiding.

01:19:54.257 --> 01:19:57.057
Okay. What do we do with him?

01:19:57.059 --> 01:19:58.425
You know what?

01:19:58.427 --> 01:19:59.527
If the airlock was working,
I'd say flush him out.

01:19:59.529 --> 01:20:00.995
We can't kill him.

01:20:00.997 --> 01:20:02.329
You know what?
You people, do what you want.

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:03.531
But I'm going to tell you what,
captain.

01:20:03.533 --> 01:20:06.534
No way I'm sleeping in the
same room with this kid.

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:10.070
Anyone is liable to get
his throat cut. Excuse me.

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:11.806
Right now we get back to work

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:14.008
and check Pegasus
is still running properly.

01:20:29.392 --> 01:20:30.958
<i>Good morning, Captain.</i>

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.160
<i>Edward was able to repair
my main frame,</i>

01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:35.596
<i>so I am very happy to be
your wake-up call today.</i>

01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:38.465
<i>However, most of my sensors
are still offline.</i>

01:20:50.313 --> 01:20:51.313
I'm sorry.

01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:03.390
Bear. And I'm really tired.
I need to go to bed.

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:17.304
Hayley?

01:21:19.642 --> 01:21:20.908
Gerry?

01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:34.521
Pegasus. A Deck corridor
panel 42 is ripped open.

01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:37.524
<i>Thank you, Captain.
I will alert the bridge.</i>

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:47.134
<i>Jane,
the Captain has reconnected</i>

01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:50.004
<i>the wiring
in panel 42 on A deck.</i>

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:52.506
<i>Some of my internal sensors
are now back online.</i>

01:21:53.109 --> 01:21:54.541
<i>All crew are accounted for it,</i>

01:21:54.543 --> 01:21:57.111
<i>including the two survivors
from the Dragon.</i>

01:21:57.113 --> 01:21:58.113
Jon?

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:16.364
Jane?

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.066
The internal sensors
on the Chinese ship

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:20.100
were down too, sir.

01:22:22.305 --> 01:22:24.672
Good job. All right.

01:22:24.674 --> 01:22:26.206
We need to get the sensors
back up

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:28.509
and make sure nobody else
is on this ship.

01:22:29.412 --> 01:22:31.712
- Are you okay?
- I'm good. Go. Go.

01:22:42.325 --> 01:22:43.325
You wanted him.

01:22:43.492 --> 01:22:44.525
Bring him over here.

01:22:44.527 --> 01:22:48.095
What are you doing?
Can't you see he's terrified?

01:22:48.097 --> 01:22:49.596
I don't care.

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:50.531
Give him to me.

01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:52.032
Be careful with him.

01:22:52.601 --> 01:22:53.601
Ask him.

01:22:55.271 --> 01:22:57.104
That's an order. Ask him.

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:17.624
He said this man
killed his crew. Hunted them.

01:23:17.626 --> 01:23:19.727
One by one,
threw them out the airlock.

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:22.262
He said he is the last.

01:23:29.572 --> 01:23:31.672
<i>Captain,
Jane has managed to get the rest</i>

01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:34.141
<i>of my internal sensors
back online.</i>

01:23:34.543 --> 01:23:36.010
Acknowledged.

01:23:36.012 --> 01:23:37.344
<i>Jay is the last survivor
from the Dragon.</i>

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:39.613
<i>Also, Edward has news
from the probe.</i>

01:23:39.615 --> 01:23:42.016
Last or not, I want him tied up.

01:23:42.752 --> 01:23:44.184
Tie him up.

01:24:03.172 --> 01:24:05.305
<i>Edward, the Captain
has called a meeting</i>

01:24:05.307 --> 01:24:06.540
<i>at your request.</i>

01:24:07.743 --> 01:24:08.542
<i>I believe the crew
is looking forward</i>

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:09.544
<i>to your findings.</i>

01:24:12.715 --> 01:24:16.216
So, what exactly
does inconclusive mean?

01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:19.253
It means we're unable
to determine from the telemetry

01:24:19.255 --> 01:24:21.622
whether the planet
is habitable or not.

01:24:21.624 --> 01:24:23.424
But that's what is there for.

01:24:23.759 --> 01:24:25.692
I mean you
are supposed to be the expert.

01:24:25.694 --> 01:24:28.462
You are here to interpret
the data.

01:24:28.597 --> 01:24:29.630
So, interpret it.

01:24:29.632 --> 01:24:31.231
It's inconclusive.

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:32.533
But what does it mean?

01:24:32.535 --> 01:24:34.668
It means that we land
and find out.

01:24:35.071 --> 01:24:36.303
Why don't we just wait
for a few days

01:24:36.305 --> 01:24:37.638
for the planet to clear?

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.772
We'll get the read-outs
from the Chinese probe

01:24:38.774 --> 01:24:40.140
about the second planet

01:24:40.142 --> 01:24:41.453
and then we'll know
which way to head.

01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:42.443
We don't have the time.

01:24:42.445 --> 01:24:43.644
Why not?

01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:46.380
Another one of our oxygen units
went down.

01:24:46.382 --> 01:24:48.082
We now have
two out of four running.

01:24:48.084 --> 01:24:50.784
We're consuming the oxygen
faster than we're producing it.

01:24:50.786 --> 01:24:52.719
How long have we got?

01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:55.189
Not long enough to wait on
the data from the probe.

01:24:55.491 --> 01:24:56.491
Pegasus.

01:24:56.625 --> 01:24:58.092
<i>Yes, Gerry.</i>

01:24:58.094 --> 01:24:59.593
How long and what
are the chances of survival

01:24:59.595 --> 01:25:02.696
if we reduce the amount
of breathers on board?

01:25:02.698 --> 01:25:04.631
- No one is killing anyone.
- Come on.

01:25:04.633 --> 01:25:06.200
<i>By one crew member increases
the survival by 30%.</i>

01:25:06.202 --> 01:25:07.501
We've lost two people,

01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:09.147
but we've also gained
an extra pair of lungs.

01:25:09.171 --> 01:25:10.671
You know, I don't see it's fair

01:25:10.673 --> 01:25:12.106
that he's breathing our air.

01:25:12.108 --> 01:25:15.209
No, we take the ship down.
Prepare for entry.

01:25:20.816 --> 01:25:22.382
Check on the boy, Hayley.

01:25:27.523 --> 01:25:29.490
There is a chance
that if we land,

01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:32.840
we'll never be able to
make it off the ground again.

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:35.462
Okay.

01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:49.343
<i>Captain.</i>

01:25:49.345 --> 01:25:51.389
<i>Jane had the Pegasus lined up
and ready for landing.</i>

01:25:51.413 --> 01:25:53.780
<i>After a seven-year-journey,</i>

01:25:53.782 --> 01:25:56.917
<i>and with all the modifications
Pete has made to my systems,</i>

01:25:56.919 --> 01:25:58.585
<i>this won't be a smooth ride.</i>

01:26:00.389 --> 01:26:01.822
<i>May I suggest we wait and run
a flight landing simulation?</i>

01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:02.890
We go now.

01:26:03.626 --> 01:26:05.726
Pegasus,
transfer helm to manual.

01:26:05.728 --> 01:26:06.927
<i>Confirmed.</i>

01:26:06.929 --> 01:26:08.929
<i>Helm is now transferred
to manual.</i>

01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:10.164
<i>Good luck, Jane.</i>

01:26:10.166 --> 01:26:11.365
Engaging descent course.

01:26:33.422 --> 01:26:35.689
<i>Warning.
External temperature rising.</i>

01:26:36.258 --> 01:26:38.926
<i>Adjust angle of descent.
Hull breach.</i>

01:26:38.928 --> 01:26:40.594
We're going in to hot. Nose up.

01:26:40.596 --> 01:26:41.862
I'm on it.

01:26:41.864 --> 01:26:43.630
<i>The external temperature
at critical.</i>

01:26:45.334 --> 01:26:47.968
<i>Jane, your pitch is off
by at least ten degrees.</i>

01:26:47.970 --> 01:26:48.902
We're burning out.

01:26:48.904 --> 01:26:50.337
I can do this.

01:26:50.739 --> 01:26:52.239
Prepare for landing.

01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:57.477
<i>Nitrogen leak in med bay.
Power overload in mess hall.</i>

01:26:59.348 --> 01:27:01.582
<i>Level two emergency power only.</i>

01:27:03.452 --> 01:27:05.352
<i>Damage control system initiated.</i>

01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:29.376
<i>Captain,</i>

01:27:29.378 --> 01:27:31.818
<i>we have successfully entered
the planet's stratosphere.</i>

01:27:35.651 --> 01:27:37.718
Mike, you'd have loved this

01:28:07.049 --> 01:28:09.883
I don't feel too optimistic
about this.

01:28:11.487 --> 01:28:12.487
Let's go.

01:28:12.755 --> 01:28:14.488
I should go with you.

01:28:14.490 --> 01:28:17.391
No, wait. Now I need you in case
we can't get back off of here.

01:28:18.861 --> 01:28:20.060
Landing is a hard part.

01:28:20.062 --> 01:28:22.663
Taking off is easy.
You're the Captain.

01:28:22.898 --> 01:28:24.031
Your place is here.

01:28:25.668 --> 01:28:26.668
All right.

01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:29.369
I'll seal the airlocks
behind you guys

01:28:29.371 --> 01:28:30.504
as you wrap around.

01:28:30.506 --> 01:28:31.805
It's going to take me
a few minutes.

01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:34.047
All right. Take your time
and we'll get suited up.

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.652
<i>Something profound.</i>

01:28:46.622 --> 01:28:47.622
<i>What?</i>

01:28:48.691 --> 01:28:50.651
<i>Nothing. It doesn't matter.</i>

01:28:51.593 --> 01:28:53.060
<i>Let's get these readings.</i>

01:28:59.368 --> 01:29:00.400
<i>Dammit.</i>

01:29:00.536 --> 01:29:01.635
<i>Are you sure?</i>

01:29:03.472 --> 01:29:05.832
<i>You getting the same
reading as I am. Right?</i>

01:29:05.974 --> 01:29:07.341
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:29:09.378 --> 01:29:10.538
<i>Edward to bridge.</i>

01:29:11.747 --> 01:29:12.779
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:15.349
<i>We wouldn't last
more than two minutes</i>

01:29:15.351 --> 01:29:16.591
<i>without the air in our suits.</i>

01:29:17.619 --> 01:29:19.779
<i>This planet's ecosystem
is still evolving.</i>

01:29:19.988 --> 01:29:22.889
<i>Way too much methane, nitrogen.</i>

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.693
<i>It's like the Earth
3 million years ago.</i>

01:29:26.962 --> 01:29:28.128
<i>It's a dry well.</i>

01:29:29.898 --> 01:29:31.998
<i>Copy that.
Better luck next time.</i>

01:29:34.803 --> 01:29:35.969
<i>Heading back.</i>

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.973
<i>For what it's worth?
You guys are doing</i>

01:29:39.975 --> 01:29:42.095
<i>what a few others
have ever done before.</i>

01:29:42.578 --> 01:29:43.710
<i>Let's hope on the next one</i>

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:45.632
<i>we can all take a walk outside,</i>

01:29:46.682 --> 01:29:49.042
<i>but be able to feel the wind
on our faces. Remember.</i>

01:29:49.952 --> 01:29:51.451
<i>Second roll of the dice.</i>

01:29:57.526 --> 01:29:59.486
<i>Where do we go from here?</i>

01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:06.133
<i>Back to the ship.</i>

01:30:17.813 --> 01:30:20.147
<i>Captain, Jane and
Edward are back on board.</i>

01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:21.782
<i>And the airlock is sealed.</i>

01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:23.817
Yeah, okay.

01:30:23.819 --> 01:30:25.419
<i>May I suggest that the crew
take a few hours to sleep</i>

01:30:25.421 --> 01:30:27.521
<i>as you're all showing
the signs of fatigue.</i>

01:30:27.523 --> 01:30:29.823
<i>I will run diagnostics
on the ship systems</i>

01:30:29.825 --> 01:30:31.191
<i>- while you rest.</i>
- Yeah.

01:30:31.193 --> 01:30:32.526
<i>It will be nice
to spend full time</i>

01:30:32.528 --> 01:30:33.627
<i>on solid ground for a change.</i>

01:30:33.629 --> 01:30:34.795
Yeah.

01:30:45.007 --> 01:30:46.440
<i>Jane, congratulations</i>

01:30:46.442 --> 01:30:47.774
<i>on becoming one
of the first humans</i>

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:49.736
<i>to have walked on
an alien world.</i>

01:30:50.679 --> 01:30:52.960
<i>I hope your first words
were suitably memorable.</i>

01:30:54.116 --> 01:30:56.683
<i>We will be ready for lift off
in approximately three hours.</i>

01:30:57.152 --> 01:30:59.052
<i>Please try to rest until then.</i>

01:31:00.556 --> 01:31:02.923
<i>Ignition sequence initiated.</i>

01:31:26.048 --> 01:31:28.482
<i>We are now clearing
the planet's atmosphere.</i>

01:31:30.819 --> 01:31:33.553
It's working. We're clearing.

01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:37.190
<i>There's a problem, Jane.</i>

01:31:37.192 --> 01:31:39.759
<i>Engine two
is rapidly losing power.</i>

01:31:40.262 --> 01:31:43.230
Pegasus, take all emergency
power to the engines.

01:31:43.799 --> 01:31:46.633
<i>Transfer in progress now.
Warning.</i>

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:49.236
<i>Nitrogen leak detected
in Engineering.</i>

01:31:49.238 --> 01:31:51.938
We've got a nitrogen leak.
Edward, where is it at?

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:53.540
- It's in Engineering.
- Get on it.

01:31:53.542 --> 01:31:54.841
- Patch it.
- With what?

01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:56.109
Go. I don't care.

01:31:56.111 --> 01:31:58.078
Improvise.
Go. Go. Go.

01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.013
<i>Captain, the nitrogen could leak</i>

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:01.715
<i>into the remaining
oxygen supply.</i>

01:32:01.717 --> 01:32:03.049
See if you can seal
that section.

01:32:03.051 --> 01:32:05.131
<i>That section is not sealable,
Captain,</i>

01:32:05.587 --> 01:32:06.720
<i>but it can be shut down.</i>

01:32:06.722 --> 01:32:08.154
We can't shut it down.

01:32:08.156 --> 01:32:10.257
It's the engine core. We shut it
down, we lose the shed.

01:32:10.259 --> 01:32:13.860
<i>Attention! Nitrogen
contamination is at critical.</i>

01:32:22.804 --> 01:32:23.904
What are you doing?

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:27.641
I need tape.
Any kind of metallic tape.

01:32:29.845 --> 01:32:32.279
Anyone would have any.
It would be Pete.

01:32:32.281 --> 01:32:33.680
No. He doesn't have any
in there.

01:32:33.682 --> 01:32:34.948
I've already checked.

01:32:42.224 --> 01:32:44.758
<i>Warning.
Re-igniting engine core.</i>

01:33:27.903 --> 01:33:30.704
You know, I really thought

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.208
the room of two dead men
would be a great place

01:33:35.210 --> 01:33:36.843
to hide a murder weapon.

01:33:50.092 --> 01:33:51.992
<i>We are clear
of the stratosphere,</i>

01:33:51.994 --> 01:33:53.159
<i>an immediate danger,</i>

01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:57.230
<i>but I'm afraid the anti-matter
engines are still down.</i>

01:33:58.033 --> 01:33:59.165
Come on.

01:33:59.167 --> 01:34:00.800
So we have no propulsion.

01:34:01.169 --> 01:34:02.836
<i>That is correct, Captain.</i>

01:34:02.838 --> 01:34:05.205
Get on port. We're going to
do it in three, two, one...

01:34:05.207 --> 01:34:08.708
<i>- Engine relay is offline.</i>
- We can put it back on. Go.

01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:09.843
<i>Reboot failed.</i>

01:34:09.845 --> 01:34:11.211
- Still down.
- It's still down. Okay.

01:34:11.213 --> 01:34:12.345
We're going to do it again.
Port, three, two, one.

01:34:12.347 --> 01:34:13.947
<i>Rebooting engine four.</i>

01:34:13.949 --> 01:34:15.115
Edward is dead.

01:34:15.117 --> 01:34:17.684
<i>Risk of radiation contamination
at 81%</i>

01:34:17.686 --> 01:34:18.852
Okay. Let's... so that...
okay, again.

01:34:18.854 --> 01:34:20.253
Edward is dead.

01:34:20.255 --> 01:34:22.375
<i>The oxy-generation
unit is spending O2.</i>

01:34:22.724 --> 01:34:24.224
How?

01:34:24.226 --> 01:34:25.075
<i>Read that procedure
and shut down the lower deck.</i>

01:34:25.076 --> 01:34:25.925
Ok. Check it.

01:34:25.927 --> 01:34:27.360
The Chinese boy killed him.

01:34:27.362 --> 01:34:28.962
Okay. We're back on s-

01:34:30.198 --> 01:34:31.798
He stabbed him.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.366
<i>Attention all crew!
Please evacuate the lower deck.</i>

01:34:33.368 --> 01:34:35.735
I was in the Engine room
when he...

01:34:35.737 --> 01:34:36.703
You got this?

01:34:36.705 --> 01:34:37.971
There was nothing I could do.

01:34:37.973 --> 01:34:40.093
<i>Life support now offline
on lower deck.</i>

01:34:43.011 --> 01:34:44.310
Okay. This ends here.

01:35:04.332 --> 01:35:05.465
You are okay?

01:35:05.467 --> 01:35:11.037
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I just, I'm just a little tired.

01:35:12.841 --> 01:35:15.308
I just need a little...
I just need a minute.

01:35:20.849 --> 01:35:22.729
Has he been here the whole time?

01:35:26.221 --> 01:35:27.420
Stay here.

01:35:29.091 --> 01:35:32.225
<i>Warning. anti-matter
level at 2% and falling.</i>

01:35:32.227 --> 01:35:33.159
Hayley.

01:35:33.161 --> 01:35:34.761
Captain.

01:35:34.763 --> 01:35:35.995
We seem to have drained
all the power

01:35:35.997 --> 01:35:37.163
taking off from the planet.

01:35:37.365 --> 01:35:39.032
As it stands,

01:35:39.034 --> 01:35:40.366
we either have enough power
to send a signal to the fleet,

01:35:40.368 --> 01:35:42.769
or to head to the next planet.
We can't do both.

01:35:43.038 --> 01:35:45.118
We're going to the planet,
right, Captain?

01:35:49.344 --> 01:35:50.744
Captain.

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.280
Take it really easy, Captain.

01:35:54.983 --> 01:35:57.183
We don't want to lose
another crew member, do we?

01:35:57.486 --> 01:35:58.486
You killed them.

01:35:59.121 --> 01:36:00.987
No, I warned you.

01:36:01.223 --> 01:36:03.923
Bad things were going to happen
if you engaged the Chinese

01:36:03.925 --> 01:36:04.958
and I was right.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.061
Now, we're going to that planet.

01:36:09.231 --> 01:36:12.398
I don't have much time left
in this Universe, Captain,

01:36:13.201 --> 01:36:16.903
but by God, I'm going to die
with the wind in my face.

01:36:19.508 --> 01:36:20.840
Do the right thing.

01:36:23.245 --> 01:36:24.377
Protect the kids.

01:36:33.989 --> 01:36:35.121
That's funny.

01:36:35.123 --> 01:36:38.792
I thought would have put up
more of a fight than that.

01:36:39.327 --> 01:36:40.393
Yeah, whatever.

01:36:40.796 --> 01:36:42.262
Where are we going?

01:36:42.264 --> 01:36:44.704
We're going to go see the ocean,
baby, just like Pete said.

01:36:45.934 --> 01:36:47.300
<i>Warning.</i>

01:36:47.302 --> 01:36:49.035
<i>Unless engines
are successfully initiated,</i>

01:36:49.037 --> 01:36:51.437
<i>we will soon be caught
in the planet's gravity field.</i>

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:53.006
Hayley.

01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:30.977
Warning.
Severe hull fractures detected.

01:37:31.413 --> 01:37:33.913
Hull integrity down to 21%.

01:37:42.324 --> 01:37:43.389
You know.

01:37:43.391 --> 01:37:47.327
That little girl
is and always was your weakness.

01:37:48.997 --> 01:37:51.064
I swore I would look after her.

01:37:51.233 --> 01:37:52.265
Why?

01:37:52.534 --> 01:37:54.500
Because her mother is my sister.

01:37:55.237 --> 01:37:57.597
And yet you didn't bring
her with you, did you?

01:38:00.942 --> 01:38:02.692
Just the daughter.

01:38:02.693 --> 01:38:04.589
They were asleep.
She was just a few days old.

01:38:04.613 --> 01:38:06.312
Anyone who had access
to the ship

01:38:06.314 --> 01:38:08.214
had to get aboard immediately.

01:38:08.216 --> 01:38:10.884
Otherwise it'd be overwhelmed.

01:38:14.289 --> 01:38:18.892
There wasn't enough time.
I just grabbed Lila and I ran.

01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:25.999
<i>Attention! The evacuation escape
pod has launched successfully.</i>

01:38:27.235 --> 01:38:30.503
Our beloved captain
has abandoned ship.

01:38:34.576 --> 01:38:37.977
So much for caring
about humanity, huh.

01:38:38.413 --> 01:38:40.079
If that planet is habitable,

01:38:40.081 --> 01:38:41.514
we have to send a signal.

01:38:42.017 --> 01:38:44.317
It could be our last
hope for humanity.

01:38:44.319 --> 01:38:46.185
Well, humanity had its chance.

01:38:47.989 --> 01:38:51.424
Where are those logs you were...

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:54.594
Huh, there they are.

01:38:59.501 --> 01:39:01.067
Do you know what he's saying?

01:39:03.972 --> 01:39:05.071
Not entirely.

01:39:05.373 --> 01:39:07.240
Well, allow me to enlighten you.

01:39:08.543 --> 01:39:12.111
They too launched a probe
into the second planet,

01:39:13.148 --> 01:39:15.982
but the probe malfunctioned.

01:39:17.085 --> 01:39:19.319
With their
reserve power all but gone,

01:39:20.021 --> 01:39:22.188
well, they knew
that they couldn't land

01:39:22.190 --> 01:39:23.456
and then take off again.

01:39:23.458 --> 01:39:28.094
So the Captain,
well he followed the probe

01:39:28.096 --> 01:39:29.362
in the escape pod.

01:39:32.734 --> 01:39:34.367
He would fix the pod,

01:39:36.237 --> 01:39:37.570
and they would receive a signal

01:39:37.572 --> 01:39:40.073
letting them know
whether the planet

01:39:40.075 --> 01:39:42.442
was capable of sustaining life
or not.

01:39:42.444 --> 01:39:44.310
Now, if it wasn't,

01:39:44.579 --> 01:39:46.312
at least
they didn't kill the crew

01:39:46.314 --> 01:39:48.715
and sentence them
to death on the surface.

01:39:49.284 --> 01:39:53.453
And shortly after he left,
one of his crew went crazy

01:39:53.455 --> 01:39:55.054
and started killing everyone.

01:39:56.591 --> 01:39:59.359
Yes. Except for a small boy,

01:40:00.228 --> 01:40:02.495
who managed to evade
his tormentor.

01:40:02.764 --> 01:40:04.097
Until we arrived.

01:40:06.501 --> 01:40:09.602
<i>Captain. We are now receiving
data from the Chinese probe.</i>

01:40:12.107 --> 01:40:13.539
Hold it right there, Captain.

01:40:13.541 --> 01:40:16.309
Don't move
or I will cut her throat.

01:40:16.444 --> 01:40:19.078
You fire one round in this hull
and we are all dead.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.214
Drop the gun! Do it!

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:35.695
<i>Warning. Hull breach.
Venting atmosphere</i>

01:41:19.808 --> 01:41:21.207
It's habitable.

01:41:21.810 --> 01:41:23.242
Send the signal.

01:41:26.114 --> 01:41:27.447
We'll lose all our power.

01:41:29.784 --> 01:41:31.084
I know.

01:41:38.393 --> 01:41:39.859
Sending the signal to the fleet.

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:49.235
<i>Signal pod launched.
Main power failing.</i>

01:41:49.537 --> 01:41:50.870
<i>We are caught
in the gravity field</i>

01:41:50.872 --> 01:41:52.238
<i>of the planet.</i>

01:41:55.543 --> 01:41:57.210
<i>Warning.</i>

01:41:57.212 --> 01:41:59.345
<i>We will enter the planet
thermosphere in 30 seconds</i>

01:41:59.347 --> 01:42:00.427
<i>due to gravity field.</i>

01:42:00.582 --> 01:42:01.647
Pegasus,

01:42:04.786 --> 01:42:06.752
what are our chances
of survival?

01:42:07.122 --> 01:42:09.889
<i>Your chances of survival
are zero.</i>

01:42:12.193 --> 01:42:13.626
<i>Congratulations, Captain.</i>
