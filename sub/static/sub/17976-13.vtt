11:11.467 --> 11:14.200
I MEAN, THE BABY'S HEALTHY,
AND YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE.

11:14.233 --> 11:17.400
WHAT I MEANT IS,
I'M HAVING A HOME BIRTH,

11:17.433 --> 11:21.067
AND I WANT TO HAVE IT
IN MY HOME.

11:22.667 --> 11:25.967
YOU MEAN YOU WANT TO GIVE BIRTH
IN YOUR APARTMENT?

11:26.067 --> 11:26.967
NO.

11:27.067 --> 11:27.967
ARE YOU SURE,

11:28.067 --> 11:29.233
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
EVERYTHING

11:29.267 --> 11:30.633
SO WELL-ORGANIZED,
AND I JUST THINK THAT--

11:30.667 --> 11:31.800
NO.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.133
I WANT...

11:37.867 --> 11:40.767
[VOICE BREAKING]
TO MOVE BACK INTO OUR HOUSE,

11:40.800 --> 11:45.933
AND I WANT TO HAVE OUR BABY
IN OUR HOME.

11:45.967 --> 11:49.500
I WANT ALL OF US
TO HAVE A HOME TOGETHER.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.933
HELENA, COME. JOIN US, DEAR.

12:16.967 --> 12:19.200
HEY!

12:19.233 --> 12:21.067
HOW ARE YOU?

12:23.100 --> 12:25.300
HELLO, HELENA.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.800
SEE YOU LATER.

12:32.833 --> 12:33.933
HELENA.

12:33.967 --> 12:35.200
STOP.

12:36.533 --> 12:38.633
COME BACK.

12:40.467 --> 12:41.967
SIT DOWN.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.100
COME AND SIT DOWN.

12:49.133 --> 12:50.600
DON'T BE A PETULANT CHILD.

12:53.633 --> 12:55.100
THERE WE GO.

12:55.133 --> 12:56.567
WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

12:56.600 --> 12:58.500
AREN'T YOU HAPPY
TO SEE US, MUMMY?

12:58.533 --> 13:00.333
[HELENA]: OF COURSE
I AM, SWEETHEART.

13:00.367 --> 13:03.067
PEGGY CALLED ME
AND INVITED ME TO LUNCH,

13:03.067 --> 13:05.067
AND I WAS THRILLED
TO HEAR FROM HER.

13:05.067 --> 13:07.100
I WANTED
TO SEE MY GRANDCHILDREN,

13:07.133 --> 13:08.967
AND I, APPARENTLY,
HAVE MISSED A BIRTHDAY.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.067
YOU COULD HAVE
CALLED ME.

13:10.067 --> 13:11.833
I WANTED
TO SEE WINNIE, TOO.

13:11.867 --> 13:12.967
I HEAR THINGS
ARE GETTING UGLY

13:13.067 --> 13:14.900
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

13:14.933 --> 13:17.267
I WON'T HAVE THAT, HELENA.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.800
YOU WON'T HAVE IT?

13:19.833 --> 13:23.533
EVERYTHING YOU DO
REFLECTS ON ME.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.333
PLEASE TRY TO REMEMBER THAT.

13:25.367 --> 13:26.967
AFTER VLADIMIR, MUMMY,

13:27.067 --> 13:28.633
I DON'T REALLY THINK
THE STANDARD WAS ALL THAT HIGH.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.067
HIS NAME
WAS DRAGOMIR, DARLING,

13:30.100 --> 13:33.267
AND HE WAS NEVER MEANT
TO BE A STANDARD BEARER.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.767
YOUR MOTHER
IS ACTUALLY

13:35.800 --> 13:37.133
INCREDIBLY GENEROUS, HELENA.

13:37.167 --> 13:38.333
YOU SHOULD TRY SEEING HER

13:38.367 --> 13:39.967
THE WAY
THE REST OF THE WORLD SEES HER.

13:40.067 --> 13:44.333
AND YOU SHOULD TRY SEEING HER
THE WAY HER CHILDREN SAW HER--

13:44.367 --> 13:47.200
OR RATHER, NEVER SAW HER.

13:48.533 --> 13:50.100
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

13:50.133 --> 13:51.400
HAVE A BELLINI,
DARLING.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.433
WE ALL ARE THEM.

13:53.467 --> 13:54.800
DO PLEASE LEAVE

13:54.833 --> 13:55.967
THE "POOR DAMAGED CHILD"
NONSENSE

13:56.067 --> 13:57.200
FOR YOUR PSYCHIATRIST.

13:57.233 --> 13:58.833
NOT THE ONE WHO'S SUING YOU,

13:58.867 --> 14:01.067
THE ONE WHO'S STILL
TAKING YOUR PHONE CALLS.

14:01.067 --> 14:02.367
[SNICKERS]

14:02.400 --> 14:03.700
I'LL HAVE A BLOODY MARY,
THANK YOU,

14:03.733 --> 14:06.400
WITH AN EXTRA SHOT.

14:06.433 --> 14:08.433
OH, I LOVE
THESE LITTLE LAMBY THINGS.

14:08.467 --> 14:09.500
DON'T YOU?

14:09.533 --> 14:11.067
THEY LOVE YOU TOO, PEGGY.

14:11.067 --> 14:11.867
OH, CHRIST.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.367
THEY WERE SO EXCITED

14:13.400 --> 14:14.667
WHEN I TOLD THEM
WE WERE HAVING LUNCH

14:14.700 --> 14:16.833
WITH DAMA TEH TEH.

14:18.267 --> 14:20.933
I'M NOT ABOUT TO LOSE THEM,
HELENA,

14:20.967 --> 14:23.067
SO I'VE MADE
A PROPOSITION TO WINNIE.

14:23.067 --> 14:24.833
YOU PROPOSITIONED
EVERYONE ELSE.

14:24.867 --> 14:27.167
YOU MAY AS WELL
PROPOSITION MY EX.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.600
WINNIE IS GOING TO HAVE
THE CO-OP ON GRAMERCY PARK.

14:29.633 --> 14:31.533
MY PRECIOUS LITTLE
SQUIRRELYKINS

14:31.567 --> 14:32.667
ARE GOING TO LIVE
IN THE MANNER

14:32.700 --> 14:34.933
TO WHICH THEY'VE BECOME
ACCUSTOMED,

14:34.967 --> 14:36.467
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

14:36.500 --> 14:38.433
TO SEE THEIR DAMA TEH TEH
ANYTIME THEY WANT.

15:24.467 --> 15:25.833

15:34.267 --> 15:36.067

15:36.100 --> 15:37.900

15:37.933 --> 15:39.667

16:08.767 --> 16:10.800

AND NIGHT TO DAWN *

16:19.833 --> 16:21.567
* WE'LL PASS ON

16:21.600 --> 16:23.433
* BUT UNTIL THAT TIME

16:23.467 --> 16:25.600

16:26.667 --> 16:29.133

16:39.333 --> 16:41.067
THANK YOU.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.567
WHERE'S TINA?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.133
OH, I HAD HER GO HOME.

16:45.167 --> 16:46.300
DR. WILSON SAID

16:46.333 --> 16:47.800
SHE SHOULDN'T BE ON HER
FEET FOR TOO LONG.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.767
YEAH. OKAY.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.900
WHAT'S GLORIA STEINEM
DOING HERE?

16:54.933 --> 16:57.367
[STEINEM]: YOUR FATHER
WAS A GREAT MAN.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.967
THANKS.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.367
I'M GLORIA.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.867
I WAS A FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.067
MY FATHER TALKED
ABOUT YOU A LOT.

17:13.067 --> 17:15.067
[***]

17:19.400 --> 17:20.567
THANKS.

17:20.600 --> 17:21.733
HI.

17:21.767 --> 17:22.967
HEY.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.600
EVERYTHING
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

17:24.633 --> 17:25.700
YOU'VE DONE
SUCH A WONDERFUL JOB.

17:25.733 --> 17:26.867
KIT'S SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.367
I'M LUCKY.
I LOVE MY JOB.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.833
AND YOU'RE GOOD AT IT,
SO...

17:31.867 --> 17:33.967
AND YOU LOOK GOOD DOING IT.

17:39.067 --> 17:40.467
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO THERE.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.400
NO. NO.

17:42.433 --> 17:45.200
NO, WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT
GOING TO GO THERE.

17:45.233 --> 17:46.200
BUT YOU'RE VERY CUTE.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.133
AW, SHUT UP.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.333
[***]

17:55.833 --> 17:57.500
I-- I GOT TO GO.

17:57.533 --> 17:59.067
OKAY. BYE.

17:59.067 --> 18:00.800
BYE.

18:00.833 --> 18:02.967
SORRY. EXCUSE ME.

18:03.067 --> 18:05.500
HI.

18:05.533 --> 18:07.067
HEY. WHAT'S UP?

18:07.067 --> 18:08.833
NOTHING, YOU KNOW,
JUST TALKING TO LARA.

18:08.867 --> 18:10.567
ABOUT WHAT A NICE JOB
SHE'S DOING, SO...

18:10.600 --> 18:12.600
THIS IS KIND OF
OUT OF THE BLUE,

18:12.633 --> 18:13.967
BUT, UM...

18:14.067 --> 18:15.967
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

18:16.067 --> 18:17.633
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT MOVING IN WITH ME?

18:17.667 --> 18:18.633
MM-HMM.

18:18.667 --> 18:19.633
REALLY?

18:19.667 --> 18:21.300
WHAT?

18:21.333 --> 18:22.667
BECAUSE I KIND OF FEEL LIKE
MAYBE WE'RE--

18:22.700 --> 18:24.067
WAIT. ARE YOU SERIOUS?

18:24.067 --> 18:25.600
YEAH.

18:25.633 --> 18:27.600
AL, I DON'T KNOW.

18:27.633 --> 18:28.667
YOU DON'T KNOW?

18:28.700 --> 18:30.433
YOU'RE HAVING DOUBTS ABOUT US?

18:30.467 --> 18:32.400
NO.

18:32.433 --> 18:34.233
OH, MY G-- NO.

18:34.267 --> 18:35.933
IF ANYTHING,
IT'S THE OPPOSITE.

18:35.967 --> 18:37.100
THINGS ARE GOING
SO GOOD RIGHT NOW.

18:37.133 --> 18:38.833
DO YOU WANT TO SEE
OTHER PEOPLE? BECAUSE--

18:38.867 --> 18:40.200
WHAT?

18:40.233 --> 18:42.800
ALICE, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT
FROM WHAT I JUST SAID?

18:44.667 --> 18:47.067
OKAY.

18:47.067 --> 18:49.600
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.

18:49.633 --> 18:51.633
IT WAS REALLY KIND OF YOU.

18:51.667 --> 18:52.800
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
MEMORIAL.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.100
HE CERTAINLY
WAS WELL-LOVED.

18:55.133 --> 18:57.200
YOU REALLY
HONORED HIM, BETTE.

18:57.233 --> 18:59.167
THANK YOU.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.733
I'D LIKE TO TAKE
THE REST OF THE WEEK OFF

19:06.767 --> 19:08.133
TO SORT THROUGH HIS AFFAIRS,

19:08.167 --> 19:10.067
BUT I'LL BE IN THE OFFICE
ON MONDAY.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.567
I'M COMPLETELY UP TO SPEED.

19:11.600 --> 19:12.533
MM-HMM.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.067
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

19:16.067 --> 19:17.733
UM...

19:17.767 --> 19:19.400
NOW'S NOT
THE TIME, BETTE.

19:19.433 --> 19:21.067
COME AND SEE ME
ON MONDAY.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.333
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL ME,

19:23.367 --> 19:24.667
I WOULD RATHER
YOU TOLD ME NOW.

19:24.700 --> 19:25.767
IS IT THE ALLEN BARNES

19:28.400 --> 19:30.833

19:34.367 --> 19:37.633
A VERY, VERY GOOD JOB
OF FILLING YOUR SHOES.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.533
UH, SO GOOD, IN FACT,

19:39.567 --> 19:41.933

19:49.633 --> 19:51.233
UM...

19:54.533 --> 19:56.800
UH... BETTE, THE BOARD

19:56.833 --> 19:58.467

20:03.133 --> 20:05.833
ARE YOU FIRING ME, FRANKLIN?

20:08.533 --> 20:09.867
BECAUSE I HAVE A BABY
ON THE WAY.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.067
THE SETTLEMENT
IS GOING TO GIVE YOU

20:11.100 --> 20:12.700
A NICE
LITTLE CUSHION,

20:12.733 --> 20:16.167
AND TIME FOR YOU TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO NEXT.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.633
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO NEXT.

20:17.667 --> 20:20.067
I'D LIKE
TO FUCKING MURDER SOMEBODY.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.733
YOU, MAYBE.

20:21.767 --> 20:23.367
OR YOUR FRIEND HELENA PEABODY.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.800
THAT'S NICE.

20:24.833 --> 20:26.200
THAT'S A REALLY...
NICE THING

20:26.233 --> 20:28.667
TO DO TO SOMEONE
WHILE THEIR FATHER'S DYING.

20:28.700 --> 20:32.267
YOU'RE A CLASS ACT, FRANKLIN.

20:39.067 --> 20:40.800
WELL, WE CALL IT
"THE GLORIA PROJECT,"

20:40.833 --> 20:42.733
AND WE'RE COLLECTING
AND TAPING

20:42.767 --> 20:43.967
ALL OF HER WORDS
AND WORKS.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.467
IT WOULD BE GREAT

20:45.500 --> 20:46.700
IF YOU COULD
VIDEOTAPE TONIGHT.

20:46.733 --> 20:47.733
OH, YEAH, WELL,

20:47.767 --> 20:48.933
I MEAN,
FOR A FREE TICKET,

20:48.967 --> 20:50.333
I'D BE TOTALLY INTO IT.

20:50.367 --> 20:51.600
WELL, THERE YOU GO,
THEN.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.133
8:00 AT THE WILTERN.

20:53.167 --> 20:54.133
WE'RE PLAYING,

20:54.167 --> 20:55.333
KINNIE STARR,
AND HEART IS HEADLINING.

20:55.367 --> 20:56.433
AWESOME.

20:56.467 --> 21:00.167
COOL. SEE YOU TONIGHT.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.700
LOOK, GLORIA,

21:01.733 --> 21:02.900
I'VE BEEN BEGGING YOU
FOR 15 YEARS

21:02.933 --> 21:04.467
TO SLEEP WITH ME,

21:04.500 --> 21:05.667
AND IT'S BECAUSE I CARE
ABOUT YOU AND I LOVE YOU.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.467
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MISS OUT,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.067
AND I KNOW, I KNOW--

21:09.067 --> 21:10.567
NOT EVERY FEMINIST
IS A LESBIAN.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.633
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,

21:11.667 --> 21:12.933
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T SLEPT
WITH A WOMAN

21:12.967 --> 21:15.433
AND I AM DEFINITELY A FEMINIST.

21:15.467 --> 21:16.967
DITTO FOR ME.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.067
BUT, YOU KNOW,

21:18.067 --> 21:19.067
WE'RE IN A COUNTRY

21:19.067 --> 21:20.967
WHERE ALL FEMINISTS
ARE LESBIANS, RIGHT?

21:21.067 --> 21:22.233
AND THEY THINK
THAT ALL FEMINISTS

21:22.267 --> 21:24.133
ARE MAN-HATERS,
SO, NATURALLY,

21:24.167 --> 21:26.067
THEY'RE LESBIANS,
RIGHT?

21:26.100 --> 21:27.967
IT'S REALLY BANANAS,
BECAUSE,

21:28.067 --> 21:29.300
IN MY EXPERIENCE,

21:29.333 --> 21:31.067
IT'S THE WOMEN WHO LIVE WITH MEN
WHO HATE MEN.

21:31.067 --> 21:32.400
[LAUGHTER]

21:32.433 --> 21:34.300
THE LESBIANS CAN
KIND OF TAKE IT

21:34.333 --> 21:35.433
OR LEAVE IT ALONE.

21:35.467 --> 21:37.400
THEY'RE FRIENDS
WITH MEN, RIGHT?

21:37.433 --> 21:39.400
ANOTHER
BIG MISCONCEPTION

21:39.433 --> 21:40.433
IS THAT
IF YOU'RE A LESBIAN,

21:40.467 --> 21:41.900
YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY
A FEMINIST,

21:41.933 --> 21:44.067
WHEREAS A LOT OF
GAY WOMEN THAT I KNOW

21:44.067 --> 21:46.633
ARE ABSOLUTELY
NOT FEMINISTS, RIGHT?

21:46.667 --> 21:48.367
THAT'S FOR SURE.

21:49.567 --> 21:50.867
WELL, I LIKE WOMEN.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.633
OKAY, BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
THAT THAT'S WHAT GUYS SAY.

21:55.667 --> 21:56.733
"I LOVE WOMEN."

21:56.767 --> 21:57.800
YEAH.

21:57.833 --> 21:58.800
CAN I JUST SAY,

21:58.833 --> 21:59.800
SPEAKING AS SOMEONE
WHO SOMETIMES LIKES

21:59.833 --> 22:00.867
THE YOU-KNOW-WHAT--

22:00.900 --> 22:01.900
"YOU-KNOW-WHAT"
MEANS...

22:01.933 --> 22:03.300
SEX WITH MEN, RIGHT?

22:03.333 --> 22:05.467
YEAH, I DIDN'T WANT
TO OFFEND YOU,

22:05.500 --> 22:08.067
BUT I LIKE THE PENIS.

22:09.333 --> 22:10.267
NO, NO, NO.

22:10.300 --> 22:11.200
YOU DON'T OFFEND ME.

22:11.233 --> 22:12.733
I LIKE SEX WITH MEN TOO.

22:12.767 --> 22:16.967
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
I'M PREDISPOSED.

22:17.067 --> 22:19.400
I BET A LOT OF YOU
ARE PREDISPOSED, RIGHT?

22:21.067 --> 22:22.567
PREDISPOSED.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.333
RIGHT HERE!

22:26.067 --> 22:27.833
100%.

22:27.867 --> 22:29.400
AS FAR BACK AS I CAN
REMEMBER, YEAH, ME TOO.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.400
NOT ME.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.667
I FOLLOW THE HEART,
NOT THE ANATOMY.

22:33.700 --> 22:34.800
IT'S ALWAYS
SO COMPLICATED,

22:34.833 --> 22:35.800
ISN'T IT?

22:35.833 --> 22:36.967
SOME PEOPLE HAVE
A CHOICE,

22:37.067 --> 22:39.167
AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T
ABOUT THIS THING, RIGHT?

22:39.200 --> 22:40.800
MM.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.133
RIGHT.

22:43.167 --> 22:44.300
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TO CHOICE.

22:44.333 --> 22:45.467
RIGHT. TO CHOICE.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.767
YES.

22:50.533 --> 22:51.800
CHEERS.

22:51.833 --> 22:53.133
CHEERS.

22:53.167 --> 22:54.300
AND TO MELVIN.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.300
AND TO MELVIN.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.300
TO MELVIN.

23:02.733 --> 23:06.067
[***]

23:17.733 --> 23:19.267
[SHANE]: YEAH.
THIS SHOULD BE COOL.

23:19.300 --> 23:22.433
IT'S A BENEFIT
FOR THE MS. FOUNDATION.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.333
GLORIA STEINEM
IS HOSTING IT.

23:24.367 --> 23:25.733
AWESOME.
THANKS FOR INVITING ME.

23:25.767 --> 23:27.100
ALL RIGHT.

23:28.567 --> 23:30.500
HOLD ON.

23:37.067 --> 23:39.067
WHAT'S THIS?

23:40.867 --> 23:42.533
OKAY.

23:42.567 --> 23:44.267
THANK YOU.

23:44.300 --> 23:46.233
IS IT OKAY?

23:46.267 --> 23:47.633
NO, NO.
I'VE GOT IT.

23:47.667 --> 23:49.767
OH. WOW.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.333
SURE.
I DON'T KNOW.

23:51.367 --> 23:53.267
I'M JUST NOT USED
TO BEING TREATED

23:53.300 --> 23:55.133
LIKE SUCH A GIRL,
I GUESS, SO...

23:55.167 --> 23:57.300
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT,

23:57.333 --> 24:00.133
"TREATED LIKE A GIRL?"

24:00.167 --> 24:01.233
NO, I THOUGHT I'D
TREAT YOU.

24:01.267 --> 24:03.667
OH. OKAY. RIGHT.

24:03.700 --> 24:06.433
I GET
THE DIFFERENCE.

24:06.467 --> 24:08.200
ARE WE READY?

24:08.233 --> 24:09.733
YEAH.

24:17.700 --> 24:19.933
[***]

24:23.167 --> 24:25.733
YOU EVER GET A GIRL
PREGNANT?

24:25.767 --> 24:27.867
NO. HAVE YOU?

24:29.667 --> 24:33.667
I THINK YOU'D LOOK
AMAZING PREGNANT.

24:33.700 --> 24:36.800
MAYBE WE SHOULD
HAVE A BABY TOGETHER.

24:41.667 --> 24:43.167
YOU REALLY ARE

24:43.200 --> 24:44.867
THE FUCKING SCOURGE
OF THE UNIVERSE, AREN'T YOU?

24:46.633 --> 24:48.133
HELLO, LEIGH.

24:48.167 --> 24:49.300
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

24:49.333 --> 24:50.300
I'M SORRY.

24:50.333 --> 24:51.300
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

24:51.333 --> 24:52.467
I DON'T KNOW.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.800
DID YOU EVER
EVEN CARE ABOUT TINA?

24:53.833 --> 24:54.967
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,

24:55.067 --> 24:56.500
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE
WHAT YOU DID TO ME,

24:56.533 --> 24:57.733
BECAUSE IT AFFECTS HER TOO.

24:57.767 --> 24:59.067
DID YOU EVEN STOP
TO THINK ABOUT THAT?

24:59.100 --> 25:00.367
YOU'RE UNDER
A MISAPPREHENSION

25:00.400 --> 25:02.367
IF YOU THINK I HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.633
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

25:03.667 --> 25:04.833
[LEIGH]: WHAT ARE
YOU TWO TALKING ABOUT?

25:04.867 --> 25:06.167
HELLO.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.333
WHY, BETTE PORTER.

25:08.367 --> 25:09.900
PEGGY PEABODY.

25:09.933 --> 25:11.333
ARE YOU HERE
BY YOURSELF TONIGHT?

25:11.367 --> 25:13.267
BECAUSE I'M SORT OF FEELING
A BIT OF A GOOSEBERRY

25:13.300 --> 25:15.067
BETWEEN THESE TWO
HORNY LOVEBIRDS.

25:15.067 --> 25:17.333
ACTUALLY, I'M HERE
WITH MY PARTNER, TINA.

25:17.367 --> 25:18.733
AH, TINA.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.267
TINA...

25:20.300 --> 25:22.433
DIDN'T YOU JUST
HAVE A TINA?

25:22.467 --> 25:24.067
OR IS THAT
THE NEW POPULAR NAME

25:24.067 --> 25:25.367
FOR LESBIANS?

25:26.767 --> 25:28.067
ACTUALLY, MUMMY,

25:28.067 --> 25:31.467
IT'S, UM, IT'S
THE SAME TINA.

25:33.433 --> 25:35.200
OH, DEAR.

25:35.233 --> 25:38.167
DID ANYONE
HAPPEN TO SEE

25:38.200 --> 25:40.200
THE SURREALIST SHOW
AT THE MET A FEW YEARS AGO?

25:40.233 --> 25:42.100
DESIRE UNBOUND.

25:42.133 --> 25:43.400
IT WAS BRILLIANT.

25:43.433 --> 25:44.967
BRILLIANTLY
CURATED.

25:45.067 --> 25:46.533
THE MAN RAYS WERE
COMPLETELY BRILLIANT.

25:46.567 --> 25:47.967
FUCK BRILLIANT.

25:48.067 --> 25:49.367
I'M TALKING ABOUT
HOW THOSE PEOPLE FUCKED.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.833
THOSE SURREALISTS
CERTAINLY FUCKED A LOT,

25:50.867 --> 25:53.367
AND IT'S VERY WELL DOCUMENTED.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.967
ELUARD THE POET
WAS WITH THE BEAUTEOUS GALA,

25:56.067 --> 25:57.900
AND THEN GALA SLIPPED OFF
AND SEDUCED MAX ERNST,

25:57.933 --> 25:59.433
WHO THOUGHT HE WAS
VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH LOUISE

25:59.467 --> 26:00.333
AT THE TIME.

26:00.367 --> 26:02.300
THEN GALA
ENDED UP WITH DALI,

26:02.333 --> 26:05.567
AND THAT LEFT
ELUARD AND LOUISE

26:05.600 --> 26:06.533
TO SHARE
ANOTHER WOMAN,

26:06.567 --> 26:08.900
THE VERY STRANGE
DENISE LEVY,

26:08.933 --> 26:10.433
WHO WAS BEING COURTED,

26:10.467 --> 26:12.300
AND BOINKED, I BELIEVE,
AT THE TIME BY--

26:12.333 --> 26:13.333
BRETON.

26:13.367 --> 26:15.367
BRETON, YES,
AND BOINKED BY PERET,

26:15.400 --> 26:17.500
AND BLABBITY-
BLABBITY-BLAH.

26:17.533 --> 26:20.967
WELL, AT LEAST
THEY WROTE FABULOUS, TORTURED,

26:21.067 --> 26:22.633
SICK LOVE POEMS
TO ONE ANOTHER.

26:22.667 --> 26:23.633
YES, MUMMY,
'CAUSE THAT--

26:23.667 --> 26:26.067
THAT ABSOLUTELY
REDEEMED THEM.

26:26.100 --> 26:27.600
WELL, YOU KNOW,

26:27.633 --> 26:29.967
ALL THAT FUCKING,
WITH NO ART

26:30.067 --> 26:32.967
IS REALLY RATHER DREARY.

26:33.067 --> 26:34.700
I HOPE YOU GIRLS

26:34.733 --> 26:36.567
WRITE FABULOUS,
SICK, NEUROTIC,

26:36.600 --> 26:38.833
TORTURED LOVE POEMS
TO ONE ANOTHER.

26:38.867 --> 26:40.733
I'M ACTUALLY WORKING ON SEVERAL
RIGHT NOW.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.233
SEND ME ONE,

26:42.267 --> 26:43.300
HEY, BETTE?

26:43.333 --> 26:44.467
HELLO.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.900
I'M SO SORRY
TO INTERRUPT.

26:45.933 --> 26:47.800
TINA'S STILL
IN THE BATHROOM,

26:47.833 --> 26:50.167
AND, UM, I THINK
SHE NEEDS YOUR HELP.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.900
EXCUSE ME, PEGGY.

26:51.933 --> 26:53.867
YES.

27:06.067 --> 27:09.067

27:10.400 --> 27:11.800
I THINK MY WATER JUST BROKE.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.400

27:29.233 --> 27:31.333
WITH TINA
AND A HUGE PUDDLE OF WATER.

27:31.367 --> 27:34.067
[GROANING]

27:34.067 --> 27:35.100
KIT, KIT, KIT.

27:35.133 --> 27:36.367
HI.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.500
HEY.

27:37.533 --> 27:38.800
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD, GIRL.

27:38.833 --> 27:39.800
GOOD. OKAY, UM,

27:39.833 --> 27:41.633
BETTE WANTED ME
TO TELL YOU

27:41.667 --> 27:43.133
THAT SHE AND TINA
HAVE TO LEAVE,

27:43.167 --> 27:45.233
AND THAT EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO BE OKAY.

27:46.433 --> 27:47.900
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

27:47.933 --> 27:49.300
TINA'S WATER BROKE.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.867
OH, MY-- OH, MY GOD!

27:50.900 --> 27:52.200

27:53.233 --> 27:54.267
MOM, MOM, MOM,

27:54.300 --> 27:55.433
THEY'VE PROBABLY

27:55.467 --> 27:56.500
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

27:56.533 --> 27:57.733

SHE WANTS YOU TO STAY,

28:05.433 --> 28:06.533
OH,

28:06.567 --> 28:08.267
[M.C.]: LADIES

28:08.300 --> 28:10.867
WELCOME TO A SPECIAL EVENING
OF MUSIC AND PERFORMANCE

28:10.900 --> 28:12.633
TO BENEFIT THE MS. FOUNDATION

28:12.667 --> 28:14.100
PLEASE WELCOME
THIS EVENING'S HOST,

28:14.133 --> 28:15.167
GLORIA STEINEM.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.200
REMEMBER
WHEN EMMA GOLDMAN SAID,

28:19.233 --> 28:20.900
"IF THERE'S NO DANCING
AT THE REVOLUTION,

28:20.933 --> 28:22.133
I'M NOT COMING?"

28:22.167 --> 28:24.533
WELL, TONIGHT WE HAVE BOTH.

28:24.567 --> 28:26.100
THANKS TO BETTY,
THANKS TO HEART,

28:26.133 --> 28:27.500
WE HAVE THE MUSIC,

28:27.533 --> 28:30.467
AND THANKS TO ALL OF YOU,
WE HAVE THE REVOLUTION,

28:30.500 --> 28:33.067
AND WE ARE GOING TO NEED IT,

28:33.067 --> 28:35.333
BECAUSE THERE IS A GUY
IN THE WHITE HOUSE--

28:35.367 --> 28:36.667
[BOOING]

28:36.700 --> 28:38.267
...WHO REPRESENTS
ALL THOSE RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS

28:38.300 --> 28:41.367
THAT PEOPLE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY
TO ESCAPE.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.633
WHOO!

28:42.667 --> 28:44.133
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
THERE'S A BACKLASH

28:44.167 --> 28:46.767
AGAINST ALL THE GREAT
SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS,

28:46.800 --> 28:48.600
AND IF WE HADN'T HAD
A FRONTLASH,

28:48.633 --> 28:50.633
WE WOULDN'T NOW
BE HAVING A BACKLASH.

28:50.667 --> 28:51.633
[CHEERING]

28:51.667 --> 28:53.100
SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO
KEEP GOING

28:53.133 --> 28:54.900
AND DO IT MORE AND BETTER.

28:54.933 --> 28:58.700
WE'RE GOING TO NOT ONLY VOTE,
BUT REFORM THE WAY WE VOTE.

28:58.733 --> 29:01.833
WE'RE GOING TO CONTRIBUTE
NOT ONLY WHEN WE'RE ASKED,

29:01.867 --> 29:04.100
BUT EVERY TIME WE PAY OUR BILLS.

29:04.133 --> 29:06.100
WE'RE NOT ONLY
GOING TO CHANGE WOMEN

29:06.133 --> 29:07.133
TO FIT THE WORLD,

29:07.167 --> 29:08.967
BUT CHANGE THE WORLD
TO FIT WOMEN,

29:09.067 --> 29:11.267
AND WE ARE GOING TO BECOME

29:11.300 --> 29:13.967
THE CHANGE
WE WANT TO SEE IN THE WORLD.

29:14.067 --> 29:17.067
SO, FIRST TONIGHT,
