00:01.823 --> 00:03.958
If london's what you want to
do, you have my permission.

00:04.008 --> 00:05.253
I wish I could talk to my mom.

00:05.381 --> 00:06.963
She abandoned you when you were a baby.

00:07.013 --> 00:08.735
You want to say here because you're afraid.

00:08.785 --> 00:11.100
Abigail hasn't confirmed
anything with the festival!

00:11.150 --> 00:13.202
- I thing it should come from us.
- <i>Dinner.</i>

00:13.252 --> 00:15.106
<i> You and me and the kids.</i>

00:17.811 --> 00:19.480
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey, Cassie.

00:19.512 --> 00:20.546
Let me take your coat.

00:20.579 --> 00:22.116
Thank you.

00:22.148 --> 00:23.350
I hope you brought your appetite.

00:23.382 --> 00:24.517
I did.

00:35.462 --> 00:37.431
- Well, this is nice.
- Oh, yeah!

00:37.463 --> 00:40.834
- Ah, the food looks great!
- Mmm.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.269
Why don't we do this more often?

00:42.302 --> 00:43.536
You and Nick are welcome anytime.

00:49.675 --> 00:52.178
- So, uh, Grace.
- Yes.

00:52.212 --> 00:54.313
Did your teacher
like your biology paper?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.681
I got an A.

00:55.715 --> 00:56.916
- Surprise, surprise.
- Aw.

00:56.950 --> 00:58.885
And, Nick, I heard the good news.

00:58.919 --> 01:01.221
A semester in London?

01:01.254 --> 01:03.190
Well, it's a big trip,
but he's up to it.

01:03.223 --> 01:04.724
Well, if he's going.

01:08.194 --> 01:10.429
- What's wrong with you?
- I didn't mean to.

01:10.462 --> 01:13.233
- But you did.
- It's the truth, is it not?

01:13.266 --> 01:14.434
It's not your place to say!

01:14.467 --> 01:15.869
It was an accident. I'm sorry.

01:15.901 --> 01:16.936
Yeah, accidentally on purpose.

01:16.970 --> 01:18.105
Okay, okay, okay.

01:18.138 --> 01:20.740
Wait, everybody to their neutral
corner, all right?

01:20.773 --> 01:22.909
So, what, you don't want
to go to London?

01:24.243 --> 01:26.179
I'm still thinking about it, all right?

01:31.585 --> 01:33.253
Nick!

01:33.285 --> 01:35.221
- Excuse me.
- Grace...

01:38.591 --> 01:40.227
Well, that went well.

01:40.260 --> 01:42.329
- Hmm.
- So much for a simple dinner.

01:43.930 --> 01:45.565
Sam, this was never gonna be simple.

02:12.326 --> 02:15.262
- Grace didn't eat much.
- No, how about Nick?

02:15.761 --> 02:17.564
He ate, but silently.

02:17.597 --> 02:18.599
Hmm.

02:19.733 --> 02:21.401
I still can't believe,

02:21.433 --> 02:22.835
as hard as he pushed to go to London,

02:22.869 --> 02:24.471
now, he may not even go.

02:24.504 --> 02:25.722
Yeah, he's conflicted.

02:26.538 --> 02:27.774
Maybe this isn't the best time

02:27.806 --> 02:29.261
to introduce something new to them.

02:29.743 --> 02:32.645
We're friends and neighbors.

02:32.679 --> 02:34.014
They're friends...

02:34.047 --> 02:36.350
Well, there may be
some bumps in the road,

02:36.382 --> 02:37.718
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

02:37.750 --> 02:38.986
Hmm.

02:39.018 --> 02:40.353
You know, this isn't
just something small.

02:40.387 --> 02:42.656
It's not only one issue.

02:42.689 --> 02:44.590
Grace has grown so fond of you,

02:44.624 --> 02:45.659
and you and I have a friendship

02:45.691 --> 02:47.460
that I wouldn't want
to live without, so...

02:47.494 --> 02:48.729
There are things to lose.

02:48.762 --> 02:50.597
And things to gain.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.766
You don't know that for sure.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.367
I know us.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.901
Yeah? And what if it's bigger than us?

02:55.935 --> 02:57.571
I think we should just take a breath

02:57.603 --> 02:59.972
and just deal with the issue at hand.

03:00.006 --> 03:01.074
And what is that?

03:01.107 --> 03:02.976
That these dishes aren't going
to wash themselves.

03:04.943 --> 03:06.446
Well, I'm glad you volunteered.

03:07.780 --> 03:09.850
Oh! Can you see who that is?

03:12.584 --> 03:13.853
It's John.

03:13.887 --> 03:16.657
He's waiting for an answer
on the Maldives.

03:16.690 --> 03:17.935
And you have one for him?

03:18.691 --> 03:19.892
I'm not gonna go.

03:21.094 --> 03:22.963
I'm surprised.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.867
I mean, that dig is an opportunity

03:26.899 --> 03:28.165
that might not come around again.

03:28.601 --> 03:31.905
Well, I had too many things
pulling me toward home.

03:34.593 --> 03:35.728
And you're happy with that decision?

03:36.508 --> 03:38.445
Yeah.

03:38.477 --> 03:40.613
Uh, the Maldives was tempting, but...

03:40.647 --> 03:41.715
Middleton...

03:41.748 --> 03:43.042
Even more so.

03:44.883 --> 03:47.421
Well, I will try to make sure

03:47.453 --> 03:49.613
that your decision
not to go is worthwhile.

03:50.123 --> 03:52.025
Yeah, you better.

04:05.255 --> 04:06.350
I need something.

04:06.383 --> 04:10.221
Blue Vervain. It's good
for stress and anxiety.

04:10.253 --> 04:11.822
Well, I wouldn't need the tea

04:11.854 --> 04:13.857
if your cousin were doing her job.

04:13.889 --> 04:15.658
- Abigail?
- Hmm.

04:15.692 --> 04:17.861
The festival could be ruined.

04:17.894 --> 04:19.629
And now, I can't find
her to talk to her.

04:19.663 --> 04:20.898
She's never where I think she'll be,

04:20.930 --> 04:22.399
and it's too late to find someone else.

04:23.366 --> 04:24.834
Ah, I should have done it myself,

04:24.867 --> 04:27.238
but, you know, I have
so much on my plate.

04:27.270 --> 04:28.839
Oh, you're a born multitasker.

04:30.774 --> 04:33.410
Cassie, I have to face the fact

04:33.442 --> 04:35.898
that for the first time
in our town's history,

04:36.312 --> 04:38.594
the Middleton Lights Festival
may go dark!

04:39.382 --> 04:40.516
Oh, there's too much light inside of you

04:40.550 --> 04:41.886
to ever let that happen.

04:42.452 --> 04:43.920
Aw...

04:43.954 --> 04:46.964
Well, I'm afraid my bright
and shining personality

04:47.356 --> 04:49.327
will not be enough to save the day.

04:50.493 --> 04:51.995
You definitely can't do it alone.

04:53.730 --> 04:55.366
You might need some of this later.

04:56.065 --> 04:57.267
Oh.

04:58.702 --> 05:01.305
Hmm. Thank you.

05:03.839 --> 05:07.310
But I don't think tea
is going to save the festival.

05:13.884 --> 05:15.452
You made breakfast for me.

05:15.485 --> 05:17.265
Well, first day at your new job.

05:17.988 --> 05:19.757
Now, I've been thinking about it.

05:19.790 --> 05:22.326
It really is the perfect
job for me right now.

05:22.358 --> 05:23.626
I mean, when we have a baby,

05:23.660 --> 05:24.895
I'll need something with flexible hours

05:24.927 --> 05:26.629
and not a lot of stress.

05:26.663 --> 05:29.449
Well, I support you,
whatever you want to do.

05:30.434 --> 05:32.970
I do wish I had someone
to talk to about things.

05:33.002 --> 05:35.545
- Hey!
- You know what I mean.

05:36.244 --> 05:39.385
I thought the feeling
would go away, but...

05:40.677 --> 05:42.446
I can't stop thinking about my mother.

05:43.947 --> 05:44.915
I can understand that,

05:44.947 --> 05:47.084
but I don't think
your mother is the answer.

05:47.117 --> 05:49.687
People can change,
if they really want to.

05:49.719 --> 05:50.953
Trust me on this.

05:50.987 --> 05:52.790
Leave the past in the past.

05:54.891 --> 05:56.232
You're probably right.

05:56.860 --> 05:58.929
And if you don't start eating soon,

05:58.961 --> 06:00.331
you're probably gonna be late.

06:04.533 --> 06:06.502
<i>Eight designer cakes.</i>

06:06.536 --> 06:08.738
- What was I thinking?
- Ah, it's for a good cause.

06:08.771 --> 06:10.473
And you can't say no to Cassie.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.543
- Stephanie?
- Uh-huh?

06:13.577 --> 06:15.545
Um, this is, uh...

06:15.579 --> 06:16.879
This is my work station.

06:16.913 --> 06:19.083
Well, it's just better
to clean as you go.

06:19.115 --> 06:21.851
Hmm, it's not better,
it's just what you like to do.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.490
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

06:31.594 --> 06:32.895
Tip to go to a job?

06:32.928 --> 06:34.798
It's just a text from an old friend.

06:34.831 --> 06:35.799
Oh, that's nice!

06:35.831 --> 06:38.067
Yeah, I haven't heard
from Cammy in a while.

06:38.101 --> 06:39.136
"Cammy"?

06:39.636 --> 06:40.680
We used to date.

06:41.571 --> 06:42.648
Oh!

06:43.740 --> 06:46.110
Ha! She's going to be
in town for the festival.

06:46.142 --> 06:47.777
Hmm.

06:48.478 --> 06:49.879
That's me.

07:02.492 --> 07:04.395
John, I owe you an answer.

07:04.427 --> 07:05.930
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

07:08.464 --> 07:10.533
I'm so flattered you asked me,

07:10.567 --> 07:13.137
and I know it would be
an incredible adventure,

07:15.572 --> 07:17.408
but I'm not going on the dig.

07:20.476 --> 07:22.457
Cassie, you'd be such an asset.

07:22.978 --> 07:24.914
You need to do this.

07:24.947 --> 07:28.452
To travel and to go
from one adventure to another.

07:28.485 --> 07:30.653
It's how you live your life. It's...

07:30.687 --> 07:32.423
Well, it's what's important to you.

07:33.956 --> 07:35.826
But it's not what's important to you.

07:37.127 --> 07:39.496
Do you remember when
we graduated college?

07:39.528 --> 07:40.630
Yeah.

07:40.663 --> 07:42.565
- Big celebration.
- It was.

07:42.999 --> 07:44.601
Afterwards,

07:44.634 --> 07:47.504
when everyone was with their families
taking pictures,

07:47.536 --> 07:51.108
I looked around the room
and, in that moment,

07:51.141 --> 07:53.544
I knew what I really wanted in life.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.180
And a degree,

07:56.213 --> 07:57.581
and speaking seven languages,

07:57.613 --> 07:59.416
and traveling all around the world

08:00.716 --> 08:02.419
wasn't gonna give me what I wanted.

08:04.019 --> 08:05.055
A family.

08:07.089 --> 08:09.025
I moved here, met Jake,

08:09.059 --> 08:13.431
and in more ways than one,
I knew I was home.

08:14.663 --> 08:16.033
And this makes you truly happy?

08:16.065 --> 08:17.601
It does.

08:17.634 --> 08:20.157
Just like traveling the world
makes you happy.

08:21.103 --> 08:24.074
Your life has really changed
since the last time I saw you.

08:24.106 --> 08:26.009
We're both doing what we love.

08:28.978 --> 08:30.647
I'll see you at the festival?

08:32.548 --> 08:34.094
Come by the Ferris wheel.

08:34.549 --> 08:36.251
I'll make sure you get
priority treatment.

08:45.829 --> 08:46.911
Wow.

08:47.730 --> 08:50.933
You turned down
the handsome archeologist.

08:50.966 --> 08:53.836
Things with Sam must be pretty serious.

08:53.870 --> 08:56.072
I think you should worry less
about my personal life

08:56.105 --> 08:57.875
and worry more about the festival.

08:57.908 --> 08:59.543
Whatever do you mean?

08:59.576 --> 09:01.945
- Martha talked to the vendors.
- Oh?

09:01.977 --> 09:04.488
She's very concerned that
they haven't talked to you.

09:04.947 --> 09:06.583
But they talked to her.

09:07.984 --> 09:10.556
She's considering canceling
the whole festival,

09:10.921 --> 09:13.090
and that would be bad
for everyone, especially you.

09:17.594 --> 09:20.531
Nick, look. I'm sorry, okay?

09:20.563 --> 09:22.031
I didn't mean to tell your dad

09:22.065 --> 09:24.602
that you're having second
thoughts about going to London.

09:26.570 --> 09:28.572
Please, talk to me.

09:28.605 --> 09:30.841
Not everybody wants to talk about stuff.

09:30.874 --> 09:33.811
But the stuff you don't want
to talk about has to do with me.

09:35.578 --> 09:37.246
- Look, I had a feeling.
- A feeling?

09:37.279 --> 09:40.884
Yes, that you're going to get
all the way over there and be unhappy.

09:42.085 --> 09:44.120
My mom makes it look so easy.

09:44.754 --> 09:45.754
What?

09:45.788 --> 09:47.957
Whenever she tries to help,
things get better.

09:47.990 --> 09:50.626
Whenever I try and do it,
things get worse.

09:50.659 --> 09:52.062
I feel like a complete failure.

09:52.095 --> 09:53.897
- A failure?
- Yes!

09:53.929 --> 09:56.398
No! I'm the failure.

09:56.431 --> 09:58.011
I bragged to everyone
about how I was gonna

09:58.036 --> 09:59.802
spend a semester in London,

09:59.836 --> 10:02.172
and if I don't go, it'll look
like I wimped out.

10:02.205 --> 10:03.674
It might not be that bad.

10:03.706 --> 10:06.309
My friends will never
let me live this down.

10:08.010 --> 10:10.079
I don't know, maybe I should go.

10:10.112 --> 10:11.647
Just to save face?

10:11.681 --> 10:13.317
What's the point of staying in town?

10:13.350 --> 10:16.052
- My dad's got a new job.
- At the hospital.

10:16.086 --> 10:17.854
It'll be just like New York.

10:17.886 --> 10:19.914
Well, no, actually worse.

10:20.690 --> 10:21.926
Now, he's the head
of the whole hospital.

10:23.158 --> 10:25.227
You think you're going to miss him.

10:25.260 --> 10:28.164
It's been nice lately.

10:28.197 --> 10:30.080
It's just the two of us.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.670
That's why you're not
sure you want to go.

10:33.970 --> 10:35.134
Look...

10:35.871 --> 10:37.306
No offense,

10:37.340 --> 10:39.996
but I wanna work this one out myself.

10:41.069 --> 10:45.582
I've been thinking, maybe, we need
to take a little break from each other.

10:54.437 --> 10:57.860
Did you e-mail my "I'm not
closing my practice" letter

10:57.894 --> 10:58.794
to all the patients?

10:58.827 --> 10:59.905
Yes.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.600
- Any response?
- A few people.

11:03.543 --> 11:04.201
And?

11:04.234 --> 11:06.421
They canceled their appointments.

11:07.037 --> 11:10.706
I guess, an e-mail is not
going to convince people to trust

11:10.740 --> 11:12.408
that I won't leave them,
like the last doctor.

11:13.208 --> 11:16.646
You know, Jill was
our first cancellation.

11:16.679 --> 11:17.785
Yeah?

11:18.114 --> 11:20.384
Maybe she can tell us
what started all of this.

11:20.417 --> 11:22.185
Don't worry, Dr. Radford,

11:22.217 --> 11:23.753
I will get to the bottom of this.

11:24.888 --> 11:25.956
Good.

11:31.927 --> 11:35.064
Mmm, those look good.
Are they for the festival?

11:35.097 --> 11:37.433
For Abigail's store.

11:37.466 --> 11:40.637
She hasn't asked me to cater
the food for the festival this year.

11:41.303 --> 11:44.440
None of the vendors I know
have even heard from her.

11:44.474 --> 11:47.893
And as I told Martha, I don't have
enough time now to organize them all.

11:48.177 --> 11:50.212
It does appear she has some work to do.

11:52.182 --> 11:53.783
I miss being a part of it,

11:53.817 --> 11:56.687
but between my two businesses,

11:56.720 --> 11:58.422
I just don't have room
for anything else.

11:58.455 --> 12:01.358
Mmm, you have a lot more
to give than you think.

12:01.390 --> 12:02.692
I'm stretched pretty thin.

12:03.726 --> 12:05.983
Too busy to do the cakes
for the auction?

12:06.734 --> 12:08.798
The children's library fund
is a great cause.

12:08.831 --> 12:10.466
- I won't let you down.
- Okay.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.735
You seem stressed.

12:12.936 --> 12:14.672
Well, it's not all work.

12:17.139 --> 12:19.964
A woman Ben used to date texted him.

12:20.804 --> 12:23.279
You're not worried that he's
interested in anyone else?

12:23.312 --> 12:26.015
They dated for over a year.

12:26.048 --> 12:29.385
I mean, I know people whose
marriages didn't last that long.

12:30.052 --> 12:31.455
Hey, Sam.

12:31.487 --> 12:33.289
Hey, what a nice surprise.

12:33.322 --> 12:34.837
Hi.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.394
I put a little treat in here for Eve.

12:37.427 --> 12:39.396
Oh, thanks, but I'm not
heading back to the office.

12:39.428 --> 12:41.197
I've got a lot of meetings
in the hospital.

12:41.230 --> 12:43.799
Oh! Well, then, I put an extra
treat in there for you.

12:45.434 --> 12:46.669
Thank you.

12:47.403 --> 12:49.172
I didn't expect the job
to start until next week,

12:49.205 --> 12:50.340
but they want me in there now.

12:50.373 --> 12:51.975
Sounds like a lot more work.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.948
Well, it's pretty intense,
but I got it handled.

12:55.278 --> 12:57.180
And I like being busy.

12:57.212 --> 12:59.858
Mmm, there's a difference
between busy and overloaded.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.797
You don't have to worry about me.

13:02.217 --> 13:04.288
I always worry about
people I care about.

13:07.423 --> 13:11.327
My patients think that being Chief of
Staff at Hillcrest means I won't be here.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.028
Hmm, maybe you need to find a way

13:13.062 --> 13:14.998
to show them that they can trust you.

13:16.032 --> 13:17.309
That's a tall order.

13:18.134 --> 13:19.836
I think you're up to the challenge.

13:29.979 --> 13:31.148
Tara?

13:44.543 --> 13:45.312
Hello?

13:46.812 --> 13:49.048
Uh, no, you have the right number.

13:49.082 --> 13:50.884
She's just not here right now.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.952
This is her husband. Is this Donna?

13:55.621 --> 13:56.656
Oh.

13:57.990 --> 13:59.893
Okay, uh...

13:59.926 --> 14:01.795
I will let her know you called.

14:08.701 --> 14:11.605
We track individual
sales of the day here

14:11.638 --> 14:13.673
with the total income here.

14:13.706 --> 14:15.609
Oh, let me take notes.

14:17.010 --> 14:19.745
Oh, I forgot my phone.

14:19.779 --> 14:21.047
Oh, I have paper.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.049
Oh, I'm expecting a call.

14:23.082 --> 14:23.981
You can use my phone.

14:24.115 --> 14:25.745
Yeah, but, I don't know her number.

14:26.586 --> 14:28.015
It's my mom.

14:28.049 --> 14:30.023
Oh, I didn't know you were in contact.

14:30.056 --> 14:31.825
She wants to talk.

14:31.857 --> 14:33.260
She was supposed to call today,

14:33.293 --> 14:35.794
but, please, don't tell Brandon.

14:35.827 --> 14:36.838
He doesn't know?

14:37.297 --> 14:39.263
Well, he thinks I'll get hurt.

14:40.265 --> 14:42.342
But not knowing what
happened hurts more.

14:42.668 --> 14:43.846
Yeah.

14:44.937 --> 14:46.773
Yeah, when I was pregnant with Grace...

14:47.639 --> 14:49.109
Oh, there was so many things
I was going through

14:49.141 --> 14:50.510
that I wanted to share with my mom.

14:51.878 --> 14:53.113
Growing up without a mother

14:53.145 --> 14:55.950
leaves you with a lot of
unanswered questions.

14:56.649 --> 15:00.019
But Brandon doesn't get why I
need to understand why she left,

15:00.053 --> 15:01.686
and only she can tell me that.

15:02.187 --> 15:05.021
People don't always know
the reasons for their actions.

15:06.094 --> 15:08.941
But if I don't talk to her,
I'll never know.

15:23.710 --> 15:24.578
Ah!

15:25.378 --> 15:26.680
Hello, Martha!

15:27.013 --> 15:28.352
It's locked.

15:29.215 --> 15:31.651
But she asked me
to deliver these cookies.

15:31.683 --> 15:32.851
Well, she promised to meet me here,

15:32.885 --> 15:34.254
so we could finally
talk about everything

15:34.287 --> 15:36.527
that she's not doing for the festival.

15:37.356 --> 15:40.659
This is the final straw!
I have no choice.

15:40.692 --> 15:42.728
I'm gonna have to cancel the festival.

15:42.761 --> 15:44.296
Now, I just have to figure out

15:44.330 --> 15:46.343
how to make the
announcement to everybody.

15:47.066 --> 15:48.802
I'll help you get the word out.

15:48.835 --> 15:51.071
It's gonna be fine.
Let's make all the calls.

16:10.222 --> 16:12.858
Aw, those are lovely, George!

16:12.891 --> 16:15.060
A perfect way to showcase
the cakes for the festival.

16:15.093 --> 16:17.963
Well, word is there isn't
going to be a festival.

16:17.996 --> 16:19.832
So why am I making these?

16:19.865 --> 16:21.367
Sometimes, you just have to keep going,

16:21.400 --> 16:22.702
even in the face of doubt.

16:22.735 --> 16:24.104
- Faith?
- Exactly.

16:24.437 --> 16:25.906
Ah.

16:27.106 --> 16:28.641
- Hey!
- Hey.

16:29.442 --> 16:32.379
- What are you making?
- Cake trays.

16:32.412 --> 16:34.381
I only have to make seven more.

16:37.660 --> 16:39.829
- And those are for?
- For the festival.

16:39.862 --> 16:40.897
Hmm.

16:40.930 --> 16:43.367
You know, I hear the view
from that Ferris wheel

16:43.400 --> 16:44.834
is supposed to be breathtaking.

16:44.866 --> 16:46.868
And I would really like
to see that view.

16:46.901 --> 16:47.936
Okay.

16:47.970 --> 16:48.904
Have you talked to Grace yet?

16:48.938 --> 16:51.674
I haven't, she's had
a very full schedule.

16:51.707 --> 16:53.308
I'm gonna talk with Nick tonight.

16:53.342 --> 16:56.111
It's not just the kids
that complicate things for us.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.313
I know, but they're
an important complication.

16:58.347 --> 16:59.948
We gotta start somewhere.

16:59.981 --> 17:01.351
You are very wise.

17:01.384 --> 17:02.953
Oh, you think so?

17:04.119 --> 17:06.623
So, Doc, you're here to help out?

17:06.655 --> 17:08.256
Um, I would,

17:08.289 --> 17:10.058
but, um, I've got to get dinner for Nick

17:10.092 --> 17:10.992
and then I have a Skype meeting

17:11.026 --> 17:12.996
with a cardio specialist
from the west coast.

17:13.029 --> 17:13.929
- Mmm.
- Wow, great.

17:13.962 --> 17:15.164
But good luck.

17:15.196 --> 17:16.599
Okay.

17:23.003 --> 17:26.108
- Hey, what are you making?
- Dinner.

17:26.142 --> 17:28.278
Looks good to me.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.682
Hey, I can tell you don't
want to talk about London,

17:32.714 --> 17:35.150
but can you at least help me understand

17:35.183 --> 17:36.752
what's going on inside your head?

17:36.786 --> 17:38.821
It's my first trip on my own.

17:38.854 --> 17:40.890
I don't know how I'm gonna
feel, when I get there.

17:40.923 --> 17:42.992
What if I hate it, or I can't cut it?

17:45.094 --> 17:47.764
If I cancel, it will be
embarrassing enough.

17:47.797 --> 17:49.021
Oh, it shouldn't be an embarrassment.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.067
Ah.

17:52.993 --> 17:54.229
Voice mail.

17:55.037 --> 17:57.973
There's, um, something else

17:58.007 --> 17:59.709
that I've been wanting
to talk to you about.

18:01.176 --> 18:02.745
I'll... I'll get it.

18:09.184 --> 18:10.720
Hello?

18:12.253 --> 18:13.290
Yeah.

18:13.822 --> 18:14.809
He's here.

18:16.192 --> 18:17.727
- The hospital.
- Hmm.

18:19.328 --> 18:20.552
Yeah, it's Dr. Radford.

18:21.363 --> 18:22.398
Yeah.

18:22.431 --> 18:24.067
No, I've got five minutes.

18:25.233 --> 18:27.069
Tonight? Sure.

18:28.971 --> 18:30.972
Okay, we need to tell
the vendors that are booked,

18:31.006 --> 18:32.975
the vendors that are on hold
and everyone in town

18:33.008 --> 18:35.467
that the festival is canceled!

18:35.868 --> 18:39.112
I can make the calls. I know most
of them from the past festivals.

18:39.749 --> 18:42.385
I think I need some more
of Cassie's calming tea.

18:43.351 --> 18:45.220
Don't worry, Martha.

18:45.253 --> 18:47.924
The town will understand.
It was out of your hands.

18:49.224 --> 18:51.226
Yes!

18:51.260 --> 18:53.462
We need more hands.

18:53.495 --> 18:56.264
Cassie said I can't do it alone!

18:56.298 --> 18:59.501
It was always too big for one set
of hands, but what about two?

19:00.017 --> 19:01.404
If you're going to call all the vendors,

19:01.436 --> 19:04.741
why not call to confirm their
services instead of cancel?

19:08.042 --> 19:10.479
What do you think of Don Benjamin
for new head of cardiology?

19:10.512 --> 19:12.115
He's a great surgeon,

19:12.147 --> 19:13.515
but he's too hard on the nurses,

19:13.549 --> 19:15.329
and everybody else.

19:15.818 --> 19:17.353
I don't think he's a great fit
for the hospital.

19:17.385 --> 19:19.154
Hmm.

19:19.187 --> 19:21.323
Jim Hart's in town from
Chicago visiting family.

19:21.356 --> 19:24.059
- Hmm.
- He's got a good reputation.

19:24.093 --> 19:25.862
I think I can get him
on the phone tonight.

19:25.895 --> 19:28.289
Ah, I hadn't planned
to be here this late.

19:28.864 --> 19:30.299
Oh, your assistant can order in food.

19:30.331 --> 19:31.533
That way we can do the call,

19:31.567 --> 19:32.737
then go over the residents' evals.

19:33.101 --> 19:34.302
I can do that in the morning.

19:34.336 --> 19:35.505
After grand rounds?

19:35.937 --> 19:37.939
Ugh, I don't think
I'll have time for rounds.

19:37.972 --> 19:39.207
I have to go by my office in Middleton,

19:39.241 --> 19:41.210
and I want to have breakfast
with my son.

19:41.242 --> 19:43.178
I know it'd be good for the
residents to see you in action.

19:48.116 --> 19:50.273
- What do you think?
- Hmm, they're very pretty.

19:51.020 --> 19:54.056
- But are they me?
- Well, they could be.

19:54.088 --> 19:55.524
You think they would go with
that velvet dress I have?

19:55.558 --> 19:57.059
The green one?

19:57.093 --> 20:00.498
Some people would think you might not
want to draw attention to yourself.

20:00.995 --> 20:03.766
The festival is being planned just
as it should have been all along.

20:06.135 --> 20:07.984
- Hi, Sam!
- Hey.

20:08.404 --> 20:12.208
I'm looking forward to seeing both
of you together at the festival.

20:16.278 --> 20:18.213
She sure is calm,

20:18.247 --> 20:20.283
for somebody whose leadership skills
are being called into question.

20:20.316 --> 20:24.053
Confidence is one of Abigail's
strongest personality traits.

20:24.086 --> 20:25.154
I was thinking,

20:25.186 --> 20:27.022
with the kids the way they are,

20:27.056 --> 20:30.126
and sensing you might be
feeling a little bit rushed,

20:30.158 --> 20:31.393
we don't have to "go together"

20:31.426 --> 20:33.962
to be together at the festival.

20:33.995 --> 20:35.330
Yeah, we can just meet there.

20:35.364 --> 20:38.167
- Well, we can meet up at...
- Face painting.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.402
Uh, no.

20:39.434 --> 20:41.837
Aw, you'd look so good as a lion.

20:41.870 --> 20:44.339
Nothing says "Chief
of Staff" like some whiskers.

20:44.373 --> 20:45.474
Nah, I better pass.

20:45.507 --> 20:47.844
Okay, um... Cotton candy.

20:47.876 --> 20:49.577
Okay, but to be clear, I get my own bag.

20:49.612 --> 20:51.147
It's nice to share.

20:51.180 --> 20:52.414
I only get fair food, like,
once or twice a year.

20:52.447 --> 20:54.850
- I'm not sharing. Not even with you.
- Mmm.

20:54.884 --> 20:56.885
Oh! Here's an idea.

20:58.087 --> 20:59.521
Ah! Ferris wheel.

21:00.388 --> 21:02.464
- 8:00?
- Don't be late.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.961
For you? I'll be early.

21:14.470 --> 21:16.105
Oh, come on.

21:16.137 --> 21:18.340
We might be down, but we're not out.

21:20.643 --> 21:21.578
I talked to Jill.

21:23.052 --> 21:24.547
Apparently...

21:25.038 --> 21:28.216
I'm the one who said
the office was going to close.

21:28.530 --> 21:31.171
That's why everyone thought
when you took the hospital job,

21:31.203 --> 21:32.757
you were closing here.

21:32.790 --> 21:35.043
- It was me.
- Back up.

21:35.075 --> 21:36.291
I made a little joke.

21:36.325 --> 21:38.995
When Jill called, I said,
"Let's get you an appointment

21:39.028 --> 21:40.688
"while we're still in business."

21:40.921 --> 21:41.914
Why?

21:42.159 --> 21:45.630
I wasn't sure if you were gonna
take the hospital job or not,

21:45.662 --> 21:48.164
and that made me nervous, and
when I get nervous, I, um...

21:48.197 --> 21:50.301
Make bad jokes?

21:50.333 --> 21:51.968
I should have just asked you
what was going on.

21:52.002 --> 21:54.238
Yes, you should have.

21:54.271 --> 21:58.009
- But why didn't you tell me?
- I'm superstitious.

21:58.042 --> 22:00.911
Well, I don't like to talk about
a job until I sign the contract.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.114
Mmm-hmm. I wish I had known that.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.148
I do, too.

22:06.066 --> 22:08.403
- What's that?
- From Cassie.

22:11.772 --> 22:15.643
She must be helping Martha
organize the kids' craft area.

22:15.676 --> 22:17.145
It's a big draw at the festival.

22:20.214 --> 22:23.017
"I trust you will put these to good use

22:23.050 --> 22:25.186
"with all the kids and their parents."

22:26.919 --> 22:28.622
Lots of people, huh?

22:29.223 --> 22:30.229
Yeah.

22:30.261 --> 22:33.226
Everyone stops by to see
what the kids are making.

22:33.260 --> 22:34.862
It's different every year.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.134
Thank you for coming.

22:44.737 --> 22:46.573
- Hi!
- Hey!

22:46.607 --> 22:50.109
- I brought both of you lunch.
- Oh, that's thoughtful of you.

22:50.143 --> 22:51.579
- Join us?
- I can't.

22:51.611 --> 22:52.745
I gotta get back to work.

22:52.779 --> 22:55.249
Oh, um, I meant to ask you,

22:55.282 --> 22:57.051
did you answer my phone yesterday?

22:57.850 --> 22:59.253
Uh, no.

22:59.285 --> 23:00.486
Huh.

23:00.521 --> 23:04.083
I had a recent call from an
unknown caller, but no message.

23:05.791 --> 23:06.726
I don't know.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.263
Oh, um, there's only
one sandwich in here.

23:09.295 --> 23:10.932
What? I ordered two.

23:12.064 --> 23:14.801
Uh, I'll go back to the Bistro
and get the other one.

23:14.834 --> 23:18.171
No, let me. I want to go
stretch my legs anyway.

23:18.205 --> 23:19.506
Okay.

23:21.875 --> 23:23.944
Hmm.

23:23.976 --> 23:25.045
You're gonna tell her?

23:30.082 --> 23:33.786
If Cassie needs another eight cakes
next year, she has to tell us sooner.

23:33.820 --> 23:35.723
Who knows what will happen next year?

23:35.755 --> 23:37.757
Well, I imagine there'll
be another festival,

23:37.791 --> 23:40.261
seeing as it's an annual thing.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.896
A lot can happen in a year.

23:41.928 --> 23:44.197
Yeah, but some things are constant,

23:44.231 --> 23:46.902
like annual things.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.170
You never know how long
something's gonna last.

23:52.138 --> 23:53.240
Okay.

23:53.272 --> 23:54.541
Oh, no!

23:56.810 --> 24:00.548
This bottom layer has
completely collapsed on itself.

24:00.580 --> 24:01.682
By the time I get this to the festival,

24:01.715 --> 24:04.618
this three-layer cake
is gonna be a two-layer cake,

24:04.650 --> 24:06.085
and it's gonna be a huge mess!

24:06.118 --> 24:08.589
- They'll have seven cakes.
- Cassie needed eight!

24:08.621 --> 24:10.990
- She'll understand.
- Ben, it's for charity!

24:11.023 --> 24:13.793
- I'll fix it.
- No, I can figure it out.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.508
- Okay, I'll help you.
- No, you don't have to.

24:17.030 --> 24:18.266
What's going on with you?

24:19.232 --> 24:21.601
It's Cammy, isn't it?

24:22.868 --> 24:25.272
Cammy and I could have
dated for five years,

24:25.304 --> 24:26.949
we would never have been serious.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.343
I just spent the last three days

24:29.376 --> 24:31.329
locked up in a catering
kitchen with you.

24:32.044 --> 24:34.581
If that's not serious,
then I don't know what is.

24:36.148 --> 24:37.784
You get the other seven
cakes to the festival,

24:37.818 --> 24:38.953
and I'll meet you there with the eighth.

24:39.852 --> 24:40.888
Okay?

24:41.320 --> 24:42.622
Okay.

24:53.199 --> 24:55.668
- Hey!
- Hi.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.804
How are things?

24:56.837 --> 24:58.105
Oh...

24:58.138 --> 25:01.140
Nick is pretty broken up about London.

25:01.174 --> 25:03.695
He just needs to find
the right adventure.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.627
I think you're right.

25:06.245 --> 25:07.735
I might know of something.

25:08.348 --> 25:10.350
You're always looking out for Nick.

25:10.384 --> 25:11.719
And me.

25:12.284 --> 25:13.753
I care about you two.

25:15.054 --> 25:16.689
Well, I've got to go to the office,

25:16.723 --> 25:18.224
swing back by here and pick up Nick,

25:18.257 --> 25:19.192
and I'll meet you at the festival.

25:19.225 --> 25:21.195
- 8:00?
- Count on it.

25:24.897 --> 25:25.866
Sam?

25:27.768 --> 25:28.836
Be careful tonight.

25:38.911 --> 25:41.347
- Biology?
- No, physics.

25:41.380 --> 25:42.749
Ooh.

25:42.782 --> 25:44.417
Well, I thought you
could use a pick-me-up.

25:44.451 --> 25:48.322
Ugh, please.
My brain is literally fried.

25:48.355 --> 25:51.058
Oh, I should have made that an iced tea.

25:52.059 --> 25:54.762
- Oh, Mom.
- Mmm.

25:54.794 --> 25:57.096
I really made a mess
of things with Nick.

25:57.129 --> 25:58.831
Mmm, I don't believe that.

25:58.865 --> 26:00.400
I tried to help.

26:01.868 --> 26:05.973
I thought that if I could get him
to understand how hard it would be

26:06.005 --> 26:09.560
to be so far away from home,
that he'd stay.

26:09.975 --> 26:13.280
Well, sometimes, an opportunity
for something great

26:13.312 --> 26:15.349
comes from something small.

26:15.381 --> 26:17.104
You just have to keep your eyes open.

26:22.374 --> 26:23.810
What's wrong, Mom?

26:27.026 --> 26:28.895
I want to talk about your father.

26:31.031 --> 26:33.900
You know I loved him very much.

26:33.934 --> 26:35.336
With all your heart.

26:37.036 --> 26:39.739
When he died, a part of
my heart died with him.

26:41.441 --> 26:43.144
He loved you so much, Mom.

26:44.657 --> 26:46.260
Yeah, it was once in a lifetime.

26:49.182 --> 26:51.285
Which is why I was so surprised

26:51.318 --> 26:56.144
when I started to feel the
way I felt about your father

26:57.022 --> 26:58.291
with someone else.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.394
I, um...

27:01.861 --> 27:03.430
I saw you and Sam.

27:05.098 --> 27:06.032
Oh.

27:07.199 --> 27:09.270
Look, as much as I like Sam,

27:09.903 --> 27:12.840
I've just never really
seen you kiss anyone...

27:12.872 --> 27:14.213
But your father.

27:16.810 --> 27:17.778
Give me time.

27:18.244 --> 27:19.847
Of course.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.083
I want you to be happy.

27:25.217 --> 27:26.853
I love you. Come here.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.763
Um, I almost forgot.

27:37.230 --> 27:38.532
I'll be busy with the cake auction,

27:38.564 --> 27:40.767
but it's important that John gets this.

27:42.168 --> 27:43.803
I could give it to him.

27:43.837 --> 27:45.740
- That would be perfect.
- Done.

27:52.614 --> 27:54.583
So, are you, um,
ready to go to festival?

27:56.817 --> 27:57.851
What's wrong?

27:58.519 --> 28:01.690
I have just officially told my teacher

28:01.722 --> 28:03.358
I'm not going to London.

28:08.128 --> 28:09.865
I just wish I didn't
feel like a total coward

28:09.897 --> 28:11.432
for backing out.

28:12.433 --> 28:14.464
You just made a very tough decision.

28:15.256 --> 28:16.606
That's not cowardice.

28:17.638 --> 28:19.974
- That's bravery.
- Thanks, Dad.

28:21.041 --> 28:23.044
Look, there's...

28:24.612 --> 28:28.016
Something else I've been
wanting to talk to you about.

28:28.048 --> 28:30.169
It's Cassie.

28:30.951 --> 28:33.989
I mean, you know that we've
become really good friends

28:34.021 --> 28:34.922
since we moved here.

28:34.955 --> 28:37.625
But now,

28:37.659 --> 28:39.528
we're both interested in something more.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.432
Ah.

28:48.102 --> 28:50.005
Dr. Radford.

28:50.038 --> 28:51.573
Hey. Hey.

28:55.809 --> 28:57.812
- I want to apologize.
- You already did.

28:57.845 --> 28:59.961
I know, but...

29:00.615 --> 29:02.656
Nick, I was trying to help,

29:04.018 --> 29:07.456
but maybe, I was pushing
my feelings on you.

29:08.088 --> 29:10.193
And by the way, you were right.

29:11.124 --> 29:12.760
I am much happier
staying closer to home.

29:14.595 --> 29:15.895
You were trying to help.

29:17.164 --> 29:19.867
It's over anyway.
I just e-mailed my teacher.

29:20.168 --> 29:21.636
Wait...

29:21.669 --> 29:23.872
- You're really not going?
- Not going.

29:24.771 --> 29:26.173
Look, uh...

29:26.207 --> 29:28.910
I can't go to the festival right now.

29:28.942 --> 29:31.547
Why don't you guys just go on without
me, and I'll meet you there.

29:32.180 --> 29:33.916
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

29:54.669 --> 29:56.071
Wow! It's really coming together.

29:56.104 --> 29:58.573
Yeah. Hey, save me a hot dog!

30:01.041 --> 30:03.077
Thanks again for volunteering, boys.

30:03.111 --> 30:05.814
And, uh, maybe save
some for everyone else.

30:05.846 --> 30:07.781
Oh, busted.

30:07.815 --> 30:09.651
Oh, don't mind if I do.

30:13.587 --> 30:15.624
Oh! No, no, no, no, no!

30:15.656 --> 30:18.626
Yoo-hoo! You there, up in the tree!

30:18.660 --> 30:20.695
The lights are too close together,

30:20.728 --> 30:22.898
they're all bunched up,
can you separate them?

30:46.253 --> 30:48.189
- The tables look lovely.
- Thanks, Tara.

30:51.192 --> 30:53.060
- Hello, Martha.
- Hmm.

30:54.127 --> 30:55.931
Hello, I...

31:03.037 --> 31:04.416
How did this...

31:04.806 --> 31:06.607
This is not how I left it.

31:06.641 --> 31:08.910
Well, it just needed
a little more sparkle.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.581
And a lot of hands.

31:14.848 --> 31:16.284
Hands...

31:22.990 --> 31:24.950
My dad told me about your mom.

31:25.926 --> 31:28.631
- I think they're gonna start dating.
- Yeah, I think so.

31:29.063 --> 31:31.766
Oh, gosh, I've never
imagined anyone with my mom,

31:31.798 --> 31:33.067
besides my dad.

31:33.101 --> 31:36.705
Yeah, it's, um, weird.

31:36.738 --> 31:37.905
Hey, you know, I almost forgot,

31:37.939 --> 31:39.774
I have to drop this off for my mom.

31:39.807 --> 31:40.942
Her friend John is
working the Ferris wheel.

31:40.974 --> 31:42.676
He's an archeologist.

31:42.710 --> 31:43.911
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

31:43.944 --> 31:45.614
He's actually heading to the
Maldives in a few months

31:45.646 --> 31:46.947
on an archeological dig.

31:46.980 --> 31:48.983
That's really cool.

31:49.017 --> 31:51.219
- Hey, John.
- Hey, there.

31:51.251 --> 31:52.720
This is my friend Nick.

31:52.753 --> 31:54.388
- Nice to meet you, Nick.
- Nice to meet you.

31:54.422 --> 31:57.092
I was telling him about your
upcoming trip to the Maldives.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.826
Oh, yeah. Pretty exciting.

31:58.859 --> 32:01.796
Uh, by the way, this is from my mom.

32:07.734 --> 32:10.104
Your mom found this in India.

32:14.208 --> 32:16.244
That's Sanskrit.

32:16.277 --> 32:19.381
We're studying about the Maldives
in our World Culture class.

32:19.413 --> 32:22.017
Most kids your age
can't find it on a map.

32:22.049 --> 32:24.353
It must be so cool
to be an archeologist.

32:25.018 --> 32:26.421
I love it, yeah.

32:26.453 --> 32:28.922
I mean, there is a lot
of grunt work involved.

32:28.955 --> 32:31.091
I'm bringing a bunch of
students with me on this dig,

32:31.124 --> 32:33.361
even a few from a Chicago high
school for a couple of weeks.

32:33.393 --> 32:35.063
Just a two-week shift.

32:35.095 --> 32:37.373
Just to help carry equipment
and assist the diggers.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.067
Just two weeks?

32:41.768 --> 32:43.559
Would it be too late
to add another student?

32:44.038 --> 32:46.274
Oh, there's always room
for another set of hands.

32:49.143 --> 32:52.847
- So, what does the note say?
- "For luck."

32:54.816 --> 32:55.917
Thank you.

33:02.490 --> 33:03.858
Amazing.

33:06.426 --> 33:09.463
Thank you for asking me
to bake these cakes.

33:09.497 --> 33:12.433
I think it was just what
was needed this year.

33:12.467 --> 33:16.489
Well, as it turns out,
it's just what I needed too.

33:28.281 --> 33:29.983
Hey.

33:30.017 --> 33:33.087
So, it looks like my festival
is coming together flawlessly.

33:33.121 --> 33:36.324
- No, not flawlessly.
- Well...

33:36.356 --> 33:38.926
A lot of effort went
into making this happen.

33:38.960 --> 33:41.162
I know.

33:41.194 --> 33:43.464
All these years, Bonnie was
able to make Martha think

33:43.498 --> 33:44.833
that Bonnie was doing all the work,

33:44.865 --> 33:47.067
when really Martha
was calling the shots.

33:47.101 --> 33:49.397
You helped Martha?

33:49.871 --> 33:51.740
This year, with Bonnie gone,

33:51.772 --> 33:53.207
Martha wanted to take the festival back,

33:53.240 --> 33:54.475
but she didn't think she could do it.

33:54.509 --> 33:57.211
So, I created a crisis.

33:57.245 --> 33:58.913
When there's a crisis, you
don't second guess yourself.

33:58.945 --> 34:00.819
You just do what has to be done.

34:01.348 --> 34:04.218
From this point on, the festival
is back in the right hands.

34:04.251 --> 34:05.486
- Martha's.
- Mmm-hmm.

34:06.820 --> 34:08.522
But I did it all for Middleton.

34:08.556 --> 34:09.973
Uh-huh.

34:11.123 --> 34:13.260
If you'll excuse me,
I have an interview to do.

34:14.161 --> 34:16.197
He's from a big Chicago paper.

34:16.230 --> 34:19.768
Loves doing stories on small
business owners in small towns.

34:19.800 --> 34:20.902
I'm thinking about
expanding my business,

34:20.935 --> 34:24.063
adding an online component,
reach a bigger audience.

34:24.539 --> 34:26.141
You can't buy publicity like this.

34:26.172 --> 34:27.809
No, you can't.

34:28.543 --> 34:30.178
You're looking for Sam?

34:30.210 --> 34:33.080
Yes, he's meeting me at
the Ferris wheel at 8:00.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.050
Well, he'd never keep you waiting.

34:38.518 --> 34:41.289
Hello, I'm Abigail
of Abigail's Flower Market.

34:41.322 --> 34:42.524
Thank you for coming all this way.

35:04.311 --> 35:05.640
Hey, what's wrong?

35:06.347 --> 35:09.918
I know you had your eye on this
little guy, but I called him so...

35:11.219 --> 35:14.054
The festival is a celebration, right?

35:14.088 --> 35:15.957
That means "happy."

35:17.057 --> 35:18.393
It's my own fault.

35:19.626 --> 35:21.329
Look, I know you didn't want me to,

35:21.362 --> 35:23.431
but I contacted my mom.

35:25.298 --> 35:29.403
I'm sorry. I know how you felt
about her, but I needed to do it.

35:31.172 --> 35:34.259
She told me she'd call me
yesterday, and she never did.

35:36.110 --> 35:39.116
You were so right about her, again.

35:39.914 --> 35:41.950
I mean, she disappointed me again!

35:43.617 --> 35:45.420
I...

35:45.939 --> 35:47.075
You'd think I'd learn, but...

35:48.289 --> 35:50.892
I just feel so stupid.

35:56.364 --> 35:57.865
Anyway...

35:59.400 --> 36:03.470
I sent her an e-mail and I told
her that I changed my mind,

36:03.503 --> 36:05.306
and I don't want to speak to her.

36:05.338 --> 36:06.340
Ever.

36:08.141 --> 36:11.846
I'm just gonna leave
the past in the past.

36:14.514 --> 36:17.351
You know, a candy apple
might make me feel better.

36:17.385 --> 36:18.854
I'll be right back.

36:25.298 --> 36:26.600
Tara seems upset.

36:27.128 --> 36:28.630
She is.

36:28.789 --> 36:30.557
But I don't think there's
anything I can do now.

36:31.498 --> 36:33.571
Trying to protect people,

36:34.068 --> 36:35.604
sometimes we end up hurting them more.

36:41.574 --> 36:42.910
I'm sorry.

36:43.510 --> 36:45.045
You don't want one?

36:45.079 --> 36:46.214
More for me.

36:47.755 --> 36:49.191
Your mother did call.

36:50.517 --> 36:52.685
That unknown caller on your phone...

36:53.827 --> 36:56.196
- What?
- I was trying to protect you.

36:56.958 --> 36:58.092
You lied to me?

36:58.124 --> 36:59.559
I thought it was the right thing to do,

36:59.592 --> 37:02.329
but now, I see that I can't protect you

37:02.362 --> 37:04.724
from whatever your mother is gonna do.

37:05.199 --> 37:06.586
But I can help you through it.

37:07.335 --> 37:10.237
You may have ruined my one chance

37:10.271 --> 37:12.148
at reconnecting with my mother.

37:29.133 --> 37:30.835
That is looking amazing.

37:30.867 --> 37:32.737
When you're done, we'll hang it, okay?

37:33.836 --> 37:34.575
Oh!

37:35.304 --> 37:37.407
Courtesy of Dr. Radford.

37:39.976 --> 37:42.212
- Hey.
- Oh, hi!

37:42.246 --> 37:44.381
I love the lanterns!

37:44.414 --> 37:47.752
You sent that box of stuff
over and Sam got inspired.

37:48.184 --> 37:49.590
I had a feeling.

37:50.895 --> 37:53.290
Seems like you've done
your own crafts as well.

37:53.322 --> 37:55.381
Yeah, Dr. Radford's idea.

37:56.092 --> 37:58.862
"Free well-check visit
good for a year." Hmm.

37:58.896 --> 37:59.897
Mmm-hmm.

37:59.930 --> 38:02.099
He said he needed to
show everyone in town

38:02.132 --> 38:05.155
that he was serious about
being Middleton's doctor.

38:05.757 --> 38:08.439
He thought this might be the right
way to get the message out.

38:08.472 --> 38:10.374
I think it just might be.

38:11.208 --> 38:12.409
Have you seen him?

38:12.441 --> 38:14.355
No, I haven't.

38:14.765 --> 38:17.548
Oh, well, I'm sure he's
going to be very happy

38:17.581 --> 38:19.283
when he sees I'm almost out of handouts.

38:19.316 --> 38:20.518
Oh!

38:24.188 --> 38:26.379
Wow! That looks great!

38:26.921 --> 38:29.126
<i>Dr. Radford. Leave a message.</i>

38:29.159 --> 38:30.615
Hey, Sam.

38:31.061 --> 38:31.954
Are you here?

38:33.863 --> 38:35.900
Okay, call me, when you get this.

38:39.369 --> 38:41.071
We're all set to go.

38:41.104 --> 38:42.907
Yeah, uh, Sam's not here yet.

38:42.940 --> 38:44.941
Well, where is he? It's nearly 9:00!

38:46.610 --> 38:48.512
Excuse me. Excuse me.

38:49.880 --> 38:52.182
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

38:52.215 --> 38:54.851
<i>The cake auction closes in one hour,</i>

38:54.885 --> 38:57.121
<i>so make sure you've placed your bids.</i>

38:57.153 --> 38:59.255
<i>It's for a good cause.</i>

38:59.289 --> 39:02.126
<i>Hello, everybody,
and thank you for coming!</i>

39:03.526 --> 39:06.063
<i>For those of you who don't
know me, I am Abigail Pershing</i>

39:06.095 --> 39:09.065
<i>of Abigail's Flower Market,
on Main Street.</i>

39:09.099 --> 39:11.267
<i>And let me be the first to welcome you</i>

39:11.300 --> 39:14.137
<i>to Middleton's Annual Lights Festival.</i>

39:21.277 --> 39:24.247
<i>I was honored when Mayor Tinsdale</i>

39:24.280 --> 39:27.116
<i>entrusted me with this
sacred Middleton tradition.</i>

39:27.150 --> 39:29.954
<i>And I have enjoyed working so hard</i>

39:29.987 --> 39:33.190
<i>to bring you the best festival.</i>

39:33.222 --> 39:35.925
<i>But I could not have done it alone.</i>

39:35.958 --> 39:37.727
- <i>No one could.</i>
- Hmm!

39:37.760 --> 39:42.999
<i>So, let's all give our mayor, Martha
Tinsdale, a big round of applause.</i>

39:53.175 --> 39:55.011
<i>Now, this year,
I have a special surprise</i>

39:55.045 --> 39:56.512
<i>in store for you for the town,</i>

39:56.546 --> 39:58.916
<i>sponsored by, obviously, my store,</i>

39:58.949 --> 40:01.151
<i>Abigail's Flower Market, on Main Street.</i>

40:01.184 --> 40:02.886
<i>So, if everyone could grab their coats</i>

40:02.918 --> 40:05.121
<i>and make their way outside to the
Ferris wheel, we can get started.</i>

40:05.155 --> 40:07.358
- What are you up to?
- You'll see.

40:09.559 --> 40:10.995
Thanks.

40:26.443 --> 40:28.278
<i>Is everybody ready?</i>

40:28.311 --> 40:30.213
<i>Dr. Radford. Leave a message.</i>

40:35.619 --> 40:37.521
<i>Five, four...</i>

40:37.554 --> 40:40.423
Three, two, one...
