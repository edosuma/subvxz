00:03.463 --> 00:06.466
<i>No matter what happens,
from here on out,</i>

00:06.549 --> 00:08.301
<i>I'm with you, Messiah.</i>

00:08.468 --> 00:12.639
<i>But if you want your soul,
you are going to have to kill him.</i>

00:14.766 --> 00:17.560
Thrice blessed, O Custer.

00:48.925 --> 00:50.301
I'll get the next one.

01:15.368 --> 01:16.369
Who are you?

01:16.619 --> 01:18.413
I am Allfather.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.540
And you know where my soul is?

01:20.915 --> 01:22.041
I do, indeed.

01:22.417 --> 01:23.501
Well, where is it?

01:23.585 --> 01:26.838
It's in a safe place.

01:37.223 --> 01:38.349
Where is it?

01:38.767 --> 01:41.144
It's up his ass.

01:42.020 --> 01:43.396
That's his "safe place"?

01:43.605 --> 01:48.401
Bravo, Mr. Custer.
Quite the show.

01:48.485 --> 01:49.986
I have him, Allfather.

01:53.364 --> 01:54.449
Don't kill him.

01:54.866 --> 01:55.950
Not yet!

01:57.619 --> 02:00.914
He has Genesis.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.205
<i>They're back.</i>

02:43.289 --> 02:46.125
From Osaka. They're back.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.421
So soon?

02:53.508 --> 02:54.592
Well, did they get the...

02:54.717 --> 02:58.555
With more souls
than you can count, apparently.

03:09.983 --> 03:11.067
We did it.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.945
Security was tougher than expected,

03:14.654 --> 03:15.905
but we did it.

03:15.989 --> 03:17.073
Good boy.

03:18.533 --> 03:19.534
What happened to her?

03:19.868 --> 03:22.871
She died. Got shot.

03:23.663 --> 03:26.499
"Security was tougher than expected."

03:28.793 --> 03:30.962
Well, where are my souls?

03:33.256 --> 03:34.382
Out front.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.009
- Out...
- Outside.

03:49.314 --> 03:50.481
What are you doing here?

03:50.607 --> 03:52.066
Waiting for you.

03:53.610 --> 03:55.737
You can't put it off forever.

03:56.863 --> 03:59.532
No, no. I'm not going yet.

04:00.575 --> 04:03.995
Everything has a price, bitch.

04:04.704 --> 04:08.333
No! No, no, no. Not yet! I'm not ready!

04:09.083 --> 04:10.209
Gran'ma.

04:10.585 --> 04:15.089
Oh, Jesse. Jesse, thank God!
You came back to save me.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.507
Yeah, I came back.

04:19.802 --> 04:21.346
Die!

04:48.414 --> 04:49.999
<i>What do you want?</i>

04:51.209 --> 04:53.586
<i>- Trouble in Zion
- Zion</i>

04:54.128 --> 04:55.129
<i>Struggle and...</i>

04:59.926 --> 05:00.927
Cassidy, man?

05:01.010 --> 05:02.136
Yeah, that's us.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.394
Yeah, it's funny.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.021
Still no answer.

05:13.690 --> 05:15.858
From Lisa. I've tried her,
like, four times now.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.612
Well, it's still early in Spain.

05:21.406 --> 05:22.824
Poland, you mean?

05:24.367 --> 05:26.202
You sent her to Gdańsk.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.162
Oh.

05:28.871 --> 05:32.291
Well, yeah...
Still early there, I imagine.

05:36.129 --> 05:38.339
You're a bad man, aren't you?

05:42.218 --> 05:46.472
Yeah, well, thanks to you
and your pernicious influences.

05:46.556 --> 05:50.685
Yeah, well, both of us
a couple of hard men now.

05:52.895 --> 05:55.064
Not the brightest of the bunch,
though, are we?

05:55.148 --> 05:56.899
Out on the town with the Grail after us?

05:56.983 --> 06:01.654
I will annihilate them. Don't you worry.

06:02.739 --> 06:03.781
We'll be ready.

06:04.032 --> 06:07.243
Well, I hope so.
'Cause these guys,

06:07.702 --> 06:09.662
you never know when
they're gonna turn up.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.248
Thank you, driver.

06:43.029 --> 06:44.197
I believe in you.

06:51.913 --> 06:53.539
As do we all.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.628
Yeah, we all really believe in ya.

07:21.192 --> 07:23.653
He's, uh... Here is... Here's...

07:23.736 --> 07:24.779
Johnny!

07:26.614 --> 07:27.824
Hey, beautiful.

07:28.741 --> 07:30.284
Your Hideousness.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.663
We're good, kid. Go hump a duck,

07:33.746 --> 07:35.373
or whatever it is
you're into these days.

07:42.130 --> 07:46.467
I was surprised to get your call.

07:47.093 --> 07:50.263
Well, I have a problem,
and I thought of you.

07:50.888 --> 07:54.559
Love women and their problems. Hit me.

07:54.767 --> 07:57.687
There's this girl,
and she tried to kill me.

07:57.895 --> 08:02.483
Oh, that's terrible. Really?
That's... Sorry.

08:02.567 --> 08:05.319
No, I mean it.
This girl is a royal bitch

08:05.403 --> 08:09.198
and I want you to take her down.
I want you to feast on her.

08:09.282 --> 08:11.200
Uh-huh, sounds like fun.
I could do that.

08:11.284 --> 08:12.869
What about you, Marie?

08:13.536 --> 08:16.706
When are you coming down
to join us in Hell?

08:17.165 --> 08:20.543
From the looks of things,
pretty soon, huh?

08:22.879 --> 08:25.840
Maybe. Maybe not.

08:30.052 --> 08:31.512
I gave you the power.

08:31.679 --> 08:37.602
You eat souls, you stay young,
you stay alive.

08:38.561 --> 08:42.773
But the day you die, you're mine.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.985
That's the deal.

08:46.152 --> 08:49.071
And it has been such a gift.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.409
But we are making a new deal.

08:53.743 --> 08:55.036
Are we now?

08:57.705 --> 09:00.791
Have you been having bad dreams again?

09:05.004 --> 09:08.382
All right, I'm listening.

09:08.758 --> 09:11.219
But in this "new deal,"

09:12.094 --> 09:14.138
I get what?

09:16.599 --> 09:17.808
You know my grandson?

09:19.393 --> 09:20.561
You know I do.

09:20.937 --> 09:24.398
I've always had an eye out for Jesse.

09:26.776 --> 09:29.487
He is a spoiled, selfish,

09:29.695 --> 09:32.782
vengeful little boy.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.119
And?

09:43.292 --> 09:46.879
He has something
I think you might really want.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.902
I signed us in.
Human Resources representatives.

10:10.486 --> 10:12.405
- Let's do it.
- Wait a sec.

10:21.414 --> 10:22.623
Seriously?

10:23.958 --> 10:27.712
My character chews gum,
yours has an ugly nose.

10:28.170 --> 10:31.549
So, yeah,
let's seriously rob this bitch.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.584
Merely a flesh wound.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.503
Yes, I imagine it would be.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.092
I told you he can be churlish.

11:15.301 --> 11:19.430
Understand, Mr. Custer,
your fun time is over.

11:20.556 --> 11:21.932
We're taking Genesis.

11:22.266 --> 11:26.020
Well, people have tried before.
Doesn't usually end well.

11:26.187 --> 11:30.066
Those people never had the resources
of the Grail at their fingertips.

11:32.651 --> 11:36.113
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was that supposed to scare me?

11:36.530 --> 11:38.824
So bold for a man bound

11:38.908 --> 11:41.702
and surrounded
by semi-automatic weapons.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.789
Well, I have something greater
than weapons or resources.

11:45.498 --> 11:46.540
What's that?

11:46.624 --> 11:51.796
Faith. The impossible, impenetrable
belief that I have been chosen.

11:52.046 --> 11:55.299
The Genesis belongs to me.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.385
How can you be so sure?

11:57.718 --> 12:00.846
I have been tried.
I've lost kin at the hand of kin.

12:00.930 --> 12:02.890
I've been buried alive
and left for dead.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.726
And still, it resides in me.

12:05.810 --> 12:08.646
If not for some divine purpose,
then tell me, why?

12:09.021 --> 12:10.856
Jesse Custer.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.902
You are certainly a preacher.

12:16.529 --> 12:18.656
You're also a fool.

12:32.837 --> 12:34.130
Comfortable?

12:35.214 --> 12:36.715
I certainly hope not.

12:43.639 --> 12:44.640
Get me out of here.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.600
This time, shoot him in the head.

12:46.767 --> 12:47.768
Shoot him with what?

12:47.935 --> 12:49.520
I placed a gun in your jacket pocket.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.939
- What the hell good's that gonna do?
- Don't worry, it has a silencer.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.233
Klaus, I'm chained to a gurney.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.610
A bazooka in my pocket
ain't gonna do shit.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.946
- I wish I could do more, but...
- But what?

12:59.196 --> 13:02.366
Starr! Are we all set?

13:02.575 --> 13:03.868
Yes, Allfather.

13:05.077 --> 13:08.873
Good. For some profane reason,

13:09.957 --> 13:12.877
the Word of God has become
attached to you.

13:14.170 --> 13:17.965
Not to worry, we will coax it out.

13:18.716 --> 13:19.967
Don't tell me.

13:20.426 --> 13:21.969
You're gonna sing me a lullaby?

13:23.137 --> 13:24.680
Leave that to the angels.

13:27.266 --> 13:30.603
We prefer jolts
of high-voltage electricity.

13:34.899 --> 13:36.901
You really want Genesis to come out?

13:37.234 --> 13:41.864
Go ahead, I can't wait to see your
insides sprayed against the walls.

14:05.262 --> 14:08.557
Genesis is not for me.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.852
I am certainly more deserving than you,

14:12.561 --> 14:15.356
but there is one that is most
deserving of wielding

14:15.439 --> 14:17.566
the greatest power in the universe.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.615
Whoo!

14:35.709 --> 14:36.919
Humperdoo?

14:37.753 --> 14:39.171
Where did you hear that horrid name?

14:40.589 --> 14:44.677
He is the Christ child.
The Lord's Most Sweet and Holy Lamb.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.929
And the future home of the Word Of God.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.014
Let us begin.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.477
You guys are making a big mistake.

14:54.186 --> 14:57.523
You put Genesis inside him,
I'm telling you, he's just gonna...

15:21.589 --> 15:22.590
Told ya.

15:24.300 --> 15:25.676
Bring in the next one.

15:42.776 --> 15:43.861
Oh!

15:43.986 --> 15:45.738
Behold, Mr. Custer.

15:47.239 --> 15:51.952
Religion's secret weapon. Science.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.379
Hey, Janie.

16:02.504 --> 16:03.922
Hey, Steve.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.675
You here for the inventory report?

16:07.092 --> 16:09.970
In a minute. How was your weekend?

16:10.638 --> 16:12.473
Do anything sexy?

16:12.973 --> 16:14.350
Not really.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.226
I walked my dog,

16:17.311 --> 16:18.646
then I took a shower.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.397
Were you nude?

16:20.773 --> 16:23.776
Well, yeah,
I didn't wanna get my clothes wet.

16:23.942 --> 16:26.654
Want to get them wet right now?

16:27.363 --> 16:28.572
And freeze.

16:30.658 --> 16:34.662
You upper management pervs need
to get your stuff together!

16:35.245 --> 16:39.458
This entire branch has become
a cesspool of unwanted advances.

16:39.541 --> 16:42.586
There have been
29 sexual harassment complaints

16:42.670 --> 16:44.546
in the lobby alone.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.341
This is
completely unacceptable!

16:48.467 --> 16:50.511
Which is why
Grail HQ sent us here,

16:50.678 --> 16:53.597
to implement
a new zero-tolerance policy.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.226
Let's try this again.
Only now, let's have a volunteer.

17:00.104 --> 17:01.188
Director Matsukata.

17:02.356 --> 17:05.983
Come on up.
Don't be shy.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.070
Yes.

17:09.613 --> 17:12.031
Great. Great.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.203
And this time,
let's reverse the situation.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.497
Janie will be the assailant

17:18.579 --> 17:22.041
and Director Matsukata
her hapless victim.

17:28.966 --> 17:30.217
Hey.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.637
Sent you nude pics last night.

17:34.805 --> 17:36.348
Why didn't you text me back?

17:37.433 --> 17:39.727
Because I am married.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.479
Give me the inventory report, limp dick.

17:49.695 --> 17:51.071
Hmm.

17:51.530 --> 17:52.614
Good report.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.534
Really well typed.

17:56.452 --> 17:57.745
Nice job.

17:59.830 --> 18:03.250
I am this close, Hiroki,

18:04.460 --> 18:05.919
this close,

18:06.795 --> 18:08.881
to making you vice president.

18:09.465 --> 18:11.008
I love my wife.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.342
Oh!

18:14.928 --> 18:16.221
And freeze.

18:16.930 --> 18:20.684
Of course, the true test is when
an attractive woman hits on you,

18:20.768 --> 18:23.228
but it's a good start. Nice job.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.230
Let's hear it
for Director Matsukata!

18:26.440 --> 18:27.441
Let's hear it!

18:31.361 --> 18:32.488
Let's take a break.

18:32.613 --> 18:36.700
After lunch, we'll discuss
office dating do's and don'ts.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.160
Okay.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.162
Very good.

18:41.038 --> 18:43.624
I'll have pamphlets for you
when you get back.

18:49.463 --> 18:51.882
You know there are easier ways
to do this, right?

18:52.508 --> 18:53.759
I'm sure there are.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.970
I just wanted to make you grab
that guy's ass.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.998
I've got a job for ya.

19:31.421 --> 19:34.383
Tulip O'Hare.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.301
What's that?

19:37.886 --> 19:41.306
"Who is that?", Sidney. "Who?"

19:43.058 --> 19:45.894
Tulip O'Hare. Who is that?

19:46.603 --> 19:47.855
It doesn't matter.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.357
Bring her to me.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.831
Whoa!

20:53.003 --> 20:55.005
I took science in high school,

20:55.881 --> 20:58.425
I don't remember so many
flying intestines.

20:58.717 --> 20:59.968
It'll work.

21:00.177 --> 21:02.554
As soon as Slotnick perfects
the cocktail.

21:02.638 --> 21:05.182
Who's Spotnik? Your bartender?

21:06.350 --> 21:10.562
Dr. Slotnick is creating
a genetic cocktail.

21:11.146 --> 21:12.439
Perhaps you'd enjoy

21:12.606 --> 21:16.485
a detailed explanation of
our theorems and modalities?

21:16.818 --> 21:18.320
Not really, no.

21:20.364 --> 21:22.282
Excellent idea, Allfather.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.410
Bring in the doctor.

21:29.247 --> 21:30.540
Genesis.

21:31.500 --> 21:35.671
The offspring of an angel and a demon.

21:36.421 --> 21:41.843
An entity comprised of good and bad
parts in varying degrees.

21:43.053 --> 21:48.558
It follows, then, that Genesis would
require that a successful host,

21:48.850 --> 21:50.018
such as you,

21:50.644 --> 21:54.231
be composed of
the same specific proportions

21:54.314 --> 21:57.067
of goodness and badness.

21:57.776 --> 22:00.862
But how does one recreate
those proportions?

22:01.238 --> 22:05.742
The answer is a DNA cocktail.

22:05.909 --> 22:10.163
This represents a genetic
combination of two persons.

22:10.247 --> 22:14.918
In this case, Serena Williams
and Louis XVI.

22:15.669 --> 22:19.214
The idea being that
when their DNA are mixed

22:19.464 --> 22:24.428
it will replicate the same formula
of good and bad that exists in you.

22:25.220 --> 22:28.807
Now, it's trial and error.

22:29.975 --> 22:33.478
And obviously, this one was
a piece of shit and did not work.

22:38.150 --> 22:42.195
But we are zeroing in. And soon...

22:42.279 --> 22:44.239
You're gonna run out of Humperdoos.

22:46.074 --> 22:49.745
Oh, no. I don't think so.

22:50.287 --> 22:53.206
Thank you, Doctor. Shall we continue?

22:53.999 --> 22:55.417
We are
well on our way, sir.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.877
My studies have shown
some interesting...

22:56.960 --> 22:58.545
Get the gun out of my pocket
and shoot him.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.005
I can't.

23:00.464 --> 23:01.673
Why the hell not?

23:01.923 --> 23:03.967
I have sociopolitical qualms, of course,

23:04.051 --> 23:06.136
but also, serious objections
to violence in the workplace...

23:06.219 --> 23:07.512
You're scared of him.

23:07.596 --> 23:08.764
You don't understand. He looks like

23:08.847 --> 23:11.308
something out of
<i>Ripley's Believe It or Not!,</i>

23:11.391 --> 23:13.852
but he's head of the most
powerful organization in the world.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.687
He is trying to put
Genesis inside Humperdoo.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.022
You have to do something.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.983
I agree, something has to be done,
but what?

23:23.653 --> 23:28.283
It's the caterers, Allfather,
calling about lunch.

23:29.242 --> 23:30.452
Hmm.

23:58.021 --> 23:59.022
What did he say?

23:59.731 --> 24:00.816
He says, "Kill him."

24:01.608 --> 24:05.195
Must be some sort of autocorrect thingy.
Uh, text him again.

24:38.353 --> 24:39.855
It wasn't autocorrect.

24:41.356 --> 24:42.357
Shit.

24:42.899 --> 24:44.985
All righty then,
so how we gonna do this?

24:45.068 --> 24:46.611
We gonna stab him? Huh?

24:46.695 --> 24:48.155
We could bloody hang the bugger,
you know?

24:48.238 --> 24:50.115
Or a blunt instrument,
and just bash his brains in.

24:50.198 --> 24:53.493
- What about bees?
- Or bees? Did you just say "bees"?

24:54.077 --> 24:57.330
Yeah. Like on <i>Wicker Man?</i> Put a cage
around his head and release the bees.

24:57.455 --> 24:58.957
- Christ.
- I vote stabbing.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.375
Look, the <i>Wicker Man'</i> s a brilliant film,

25:00.458 --> 25:02.169
but we're talking about killing
a man here, Kev.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.087
- I know.
- No, you don't.

25:04.171 --> 25:05.630
Look, where are you even
gonna get bees from?

25:05.714 --> 25:07.257
What, you have ready access to bees
all of a sudden?

25:07.340 --> 25:08.466
You a beekeeper now, are you?

25:08.550 --> 25:09.551
Yeah, I am.

25:10.594 --> 25:12.137
- You are?
- Yes.

25:12.220 --> 25:15.724
Beekeeper? All right, apologies.

25:15.807 --> 25:17.309
I'm sorry. It's actually...
It's a brilliant idea.

25:17.392 --> 25:18.810
We'll go with the bees.
Do you wanna do the bees?

25:18.894 --> 25:20.896
Let's do the bees.
I'd imagine we need some honey.

25:20.979 --> 25:22.189
Go and have a word
with your grandmother.

25:22.355 --> 25:27.652
Explain why are we thinking
of killing this man?

25:28.111 --> 25:30.280
Because everyone I ever liked,

25:30.363 --> 25:33.658
he and his bloody Grail people
have tried to kill, right?

25:33.742 --> 25:36.328
That's just for starters.
His people hate us, all right?

25:37.037 --> 25:38.163
I remember.

25:38.872 --> 25:41.791
I'm merely suggesting that there

25:42.417 --> 25:44.336
might be a better way
to make use of him.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.215
Better way of feeding our cause.

25:48.882 --> 25:50.842
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, indeed, I am.

25:52.344 --> 25:55.430
He deserves a choice.
The choice that we've all made.

25:56.723 --> 26:00.560
Death, or everlasting life?

26:22.582 --> 26:24.626
Who the hell is that?

26:27.837 --> 26:30.715
It's Director Matsukata's access entry.

26:35.679 --> 26:38.098
...but that's not him.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.651
Who are you?

26:50.694 --> 26:52.195
Human Resources.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.699
Time to check your browser history.

27:04.457 --> 27:05.709
We're good.

27:10.964 --> 27:13.883
So, simple steel,

27:14.175 --> 27:17.178
side grate, heavy-duty cylinder.

27:17.595 --> 27:18.972
Okay.

27:19.347 --> 27:23.143
Well, shouldn't take much more than...

27:23.226 --> 27:24.311
I got it.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.313
I think you'll find I got it.

27:27.272 --> 27:28.773
Seriously, I wouldn't do that.

27:29.899 --> 27:33.153
What, so I just stand here
and watch you hack into the mainframe?

27:33.236 --> 27:34.988
Unless you also earned a graduate degree

27:35.071 --> 27:36.781
in computer science from MIT.

27:36.865 --> 27:39.409
But, no. I read your file.

27:40.118 --> 27:42.162
You got kicked out of 10th grade.

27:42.954 --> 27:44.539
Why don't you chew your gum?

27:46.249 --> 27:47.250
Shit.

27:47.584 --> 27:49.127
Enough of this bullshit.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.670
I'm telling you, I wouldn't do that.

27:52.047 --> 27:54.174
You wouldn't 'cause you couldn't.

27:55.592 --> 27:57.969
And by the way,
I didn't get kicked out of 10th grade,

27:58.345 --> 27:59.763
I dropped out.

28:10.398 --> 28:14.069
There are so many things
I could say right now, but...

28:21.326 --> 28:22.994
Just about through the firewall.

28:35.590 --> 28:38.593
So many things
I could say right now, but...

28:55.485 --> 28:56.486
Damn.

28:56.736 --> 28:59.197
All right.
Do you trust me?

28:59.280 --> 29:00.448
I do.

29:00.532 --> 29:01.783
Do you choose this freely?

29:02.117 --> 29:03.118
I do.

29:03.326 --> 29:04.828
Will you forsake
the sunlit world

29:04.911 --> 29:07.288
and surrender to our dark
and scarlet urging?

29:09.707 --> 29:11.626
Like, no sun at all?

29:11.876 --> 29:14.629
No sunset strolls? No beaches?

29:14.921 --> 29:16.089
Well, umbrellas,

29:16.172 --> 29:18.091
but that's all the time,
everywhere you go.

29:18.174 --> 29:20.176
I mean, you'll be having
bloody dreams about umbrellas,

29:20.260 --> 29:21.344
you can trust me on that.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.306
Or we could just bloody kill ya, I mean,

29:25.390 --> 29:27.183
I'm sure there's a lot of people
who'd probably prefer that.

29:27.475 --> 29:28.560
No.

29:29.060 --> 29:32.105
I don't wanna die. My mom'd be upset.

29:32.397 --> 29:35.191
- You sure?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

29:35.525 --> 29:37.277
All right.

29:40.321 --> 29:41.406
Chill out.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.700
Jaysus.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.169
It was awesome.

30:03.428 --> 30:05.847
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

30:09.476 --> 30:11.102
Bollocks! Ugh!

30:11.186 --> 30:12.979
Were you, um, trying to fly?

30:13.062 --> 30:14.981
I'd settle for some bloody floating
at this point.

30:15.190 --> 30:17.609
Yes, well, so would Mrs. Rosen.
That was her lamp.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.402
No, listen, that's two people
I've turned now.

30:19.486 --> 30:22.113
And that's three including Denis,
and I still can't do what you can do.

30:22.363 --> 30:24.532
You've turned three,
I've turned hundreds.

30:25.074 --> 30:26.534
And you flew a bit the other night.

30:26.618 --> 30:28.244
Oh, come on, you were helping me out.

30:28.328 --> 30:30.747
Well, I might have guided you
a little bit, but you were flying.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.874
No, I wasn't, and you know it.

30:34.167 --> 30:35.668
Eccarius, come on.

30:36.544 --> 30:37.879
What are you not teaching me?

30:38.588 --> 30:39.881
Well, um...

30:41.799 --> 30:43.426
Patience, clearly.

30:46.179 --> 30:49.641
What's happening over here?
Mr. Hoover!

30:49.724 --> 30:51.267
- It's F.J., isn't it?
- Yeah.

30:51.351 --> 30:53.019
Do you mind if I call you F.J.?

30:53.311 --> 30:55.897
- No.
- Didn't F.J. do well?

30:55.980 --> 30:56.981
Yeah.

30:57.273 --> 30:59.442
Hardly a tear. Hip-hip...

30:59.859 --> 31:01.528
Hooray!

31:20.255 --> 31:22.006
All right. Well, that was easy.

31:22.131 --> 31:24.509
Uh-huh.
You haven't screwed anything up yet.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.721
Okay, that's it. What is your...

31:28.805 --> 31:29.847
Eh-eh-eh.

31:29.973 --> 31:33.560
None of that. Be professional. Let's go.

31:54.247 --> 31:57.041
Miss Marie. Yeah, we got 'em, no sweat.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.127
Uh-huh.

31:59.335 --> 32:01.212
Yeah, I'm listening.

32:21.524 --> 32:22.650
Wow.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.777
Excuse me, miss?

32:25.445 --> 32:30.950
I never do this, but your booty meat
is off the charts.

32:31.326 --> 32:32.785
I want to squeeze it...

32:33.578 --> 32:35.830
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to New Orleans.</i>

32:35.913 --> 32:37.081
<i>Please be aware,</i>

32:37.165 --> 32:39.834
<i>some of your bags may have shifted
in the overhead compartments.</i>

32:44.672 --> 32:46.841
Getting the truck. Meet you out front.

32:51.512 --> 32:54.390
Look, I know we get on each other's
nerves sometimes,

32:54.474 --> 32:58.770
but nice job. Seriously. I'm a fan.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.982
Thanks. Appreciate that.

33:03.566 --> 33:05.068
I was joking.

33:07.445 --> 33:08.655
So was I!

33:14.410 --> 33:15.662
Tulip O'Hare.

33:17.372 --> 33:18.373
No, sorry.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.710
Brown hair. Dressed as a Grail officer.

33:23.127 --> 33:26.214
Back from Osaka. You're Tulip O'Hare.

33:26.964 --> 33:29.300
No, ma'am, my name is Hiroki Matsukata.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.679
See?

33:39.394 --> 33:40.395
My mistake.

33:40.478 --> 33:41.646
Mmm-hmm.

33:45.733 --> 33:46.818
Oh, but, um...

33:46.984 --> 33:50.697
If you're looking for a brown-hair
Grail officer just back from Osaka,

33:51.155 --> 33:52.407
I know where you can find her.

34:06.421 --> 34:07.672
Let's go.

34:08.965 --> 34:10.341
- Where's...
- She didn't make it.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.344
- What?
- Some cop lady took her.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.929
Oh, well. At least we got the...

34:19.475 --> 34:23.020
Shit! O'Hare, you stupid...

34:24.813 --> 34:25.857
Okay.

34:27.442 --> 34:29.360
Okay, just shut up and think.

34:30.570 --> 34:34.532
No big deal. We just track
the cop lady down to the station

34:34.614 --> 34:36.159
and get back my briefcase back.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.869
- That wasn't a cop.
- What?

34:37.952 --> 34:40.621
And she wasn't taking Featherstone
to no goddamn station.

34:40.705 --> 34:42.956
Where is she taking her?

34:43.623 --> 34:45.793
Where is she taking her?

34:59.140 --> 35:00.558
What, you sending him off already?

35:00.641 --> 35:02.435
There's no rest for the weary
or the wicked.

35:02.518 --> 35:04.479
And Mr. Hoover is ready.

35:05.646 --> 35:08.232
All right, you lot, he's off.

35:08.316 --> 35:11.194
Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly!

35:17.784 --> 35:20.661
All right. Now, we're giving you
a second chance here.

35:21.579 --> 35:22.997
Don't be a dick.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.542
Here. First of many.

35:27.543 --> 35:28.669
You're a good guy.

35:28.753 --> 35:29.879
Mmm-hmm.

35:30.880 --> 35:35.009
Fly! Fly! Fly!

35:58.449 --> 36:00.701
Once did
a Grail job in Kuala Lumpur.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.538
Humidity is worse than New Orleans,
if you can believe that,

36:04.288 --> 36:05.957
but the Batu Caves were lovely.

36:13.130 --> 36:14.340
<i>Don Giovanni?</i>

36:23.808 --> 36:25.685
Tell me, Mr. Hoover,

36:26.477 --> 36:30.231
why would I send another vampire
out into the world?

36:30.982 --> 36:33.025
A filthy piece of vermin?

36:33.568 --> 36:35.611
Spoiling, stinking,

36:37.822 --> 36:42.201
and falling into despair?

36:44.537 --> 36:46.038
For charity?

36:46.664 --> 36:48.291
That's what I was told.

36:49.584 --> 36:50.585
What are you doing?

36:50.668 --> 36:51.919
Yeah.

37:01.554 --> 37:05.057
Cassidy. What's the matter?
Everything all right?

37:07.435 --> 37:10.021
Is that where you get
your secret powers, is it? Huh?

37:10.855 --> 37:14.525
Listen, um, you and I
can talk about this afterwards.

37:15.109 --> 37:19.405
For the time being, I'm going to take
Mr. Hoover here to the airport.

37:20.531 --> 37:23.367
You're not taking him anywhere,
you murdering piece of shit.

37:31.584 --> 37:32.585
Cassidy?

37:43.054 --> 37:44.347
This is it.

37:45.806 --> 37:48.935
Founding Father Thomas Jefferson,

37:49.185 --> 37:53.356
combined with television icon
Wayne Brady.

37:53.898 --> 37:58.110
I call it the Tom/Brady.

37:59.904 --> 38:03.240
Have you instructed the clone
on the proper command?

38:03.324 --> 38:04.367
Yes, sir. This is...

38:04.450 --> 38:08.412
I can't believe it.
Allfather's about to weaponize idiocy.

38:08.537 --> 38:09.997
What did you expect was gonna happen?

38:10.122 --> 38:12.375
A woman scientist?
I didn't believe it was possible.

38:12.541 --> 38:14.710
Well, she is about to make
the impossible possible.

38:15.086 --> 38:16.504
What are you gonna do about it?

38:16.587 --> 38:20.174
Yes. I'm going to reach
into your pocket...

38:20.257 --> 38:21.550
<i>Herr</i> Starr,

38:24.804 --> 38:30.184
you are one of my most loyal
and trusted servants. Are you not?

38:30.601 --> 38:32.144
I am, Allfather.

38:32.937 --> 38:35.356
Do something for me, O Starr?

38:36.357 --> 38:37.650
Anything, Allfather.

38:39.026 --> 38:40.111
Beignets.

38:40.903 --> 38:44.615
Café Du Monde.
Fetch me a few dozen, now.

38:58.754 --> 39:00.673
Genesis chose me, Allfather.

39:01.841 --> 39:03.217
It was meant for me.

39:03.300 --> 39:07.722
A drunk? A thief? A blasphemer?

39:08.222 --> 39:11.809
You are a mistake, Mr. Custer.

39:11.976 --> 39:14.228
That's right, you sack of shit.

39:14.812 --> 39:19.275
I'm the mistake that's gonna
find God and hold Him to account.

39:19.442 --> 39:21.318
We are ready to begin.

39:22.570 --> 39:25.072
But now you won't have to, Preacher,

39:25.906 --> 39:30.202
because this is all
the God we shall ever need.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.317
Say the command.

40:05.821 --> 40:10.201
Bow before me.

40:25.424 --> 40:28.803
Good. Now,

40:31.055 --> 40:33.349
bring in the Messiah.

40:38.187 --> 40:41.899
God's got his plan,
something He wants me to do.

40:43.192 --> 40:44.735
I don't know what that is,

40:44.819 --> 40:47.113
but it's the only thing
that makes sense.

40:47.655 --> 40:51.325
He's got a plan.
Just like the Bible says,

40:51.408 --> 40:54.328
"Trust in God. Lean not on your
own understanding",

40:54.411 --> 40:58.207
so that's exactly what I'm gonna do,
I'm just gonna keep on...

40:58.833 --> 41:00.334
I'm just gonna keep on leaning.

41:10.803 --> 41:11.929
Hello.

41:14.515 --> 41:18.144
Do you, by any chance, have a phone?

41:18.769 --> 41:21.230
I need to text a friend of mine.

41:32.199 --> 41:33.617
Oh, shit.

41:35.161 --> 41:36.453
They got Hilter.
