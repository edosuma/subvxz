WEBVTT

00:45.462 --> 00:46.588
You have powers?

00:46.671 --> 00:48.173
I have powers.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.021
You had a good run, but...

01:05.190 --> 01:08.860
this time, the planet hits back.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.820
How are you doing this?

01:10.987 --> 01:12.363
How do you think I did it?

01:12.906 --> 01:15.950
I'm Lex Luthor.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.082
<i>Raise your right hand.</i>

01:22.540 --> 01:25.543
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth,</i>
<i>the whole truth and nothing but the truth?</i>

01:25.960 --> 01:27.086
<i>I do.</i>

01:27.253 --> 01:29.214
One disagreement over his obsession,

01:29.714 --> 01:30.715
and he shut me out.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.177
Threw me out of the company,
and himself into his crusade.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.095
He killed people.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.766
Luthor kept offering Superman
a place in his organization.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.101
Of course, Superman knew who he was.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.354
And Luthor didn't take the rejection well.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.606
He used to say
we were burdened with excellence,

01:47.023 --> 01:48.942
and it was just
me and him against the world.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.736
And if I'm honest with myself,
I believed him.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.574
I was blind enough
to think that he wanted a partner...

01:56.658 --> 01:58.076
But he wanted a pet Kryptonian.
...but he wanted a sycophant.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.121
He kidnapped me.

02:02.038 --> 02:05.333
And I have 16 scars from the torture.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.169
I have submitted
our every correspondence into evidence.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.547
Enough smoking guns for an army.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.923
Plus...

02:14.300 --> 02:16.177
When he turned the sun red...

02:19.681 --> 02:21.057
I was wearing a wire.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.768
Mr. Luthor,
you are charged with murder,

02:23.852 --> 02:26.396
ecoterrorism, and crimes against humanity.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.481
Since you have chosen
to represent yourself,

02:28.565 --> 02:31.401
have you anything to say
before I render the verdict of this court?

02:36.322 --> 02:38.283
Superman made me do it.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.620
This is a paradigm shift.
Aliens are among us.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.457
And for the rest of human history,

02:46.541 --> 02:49.502
there will only ever be before Superman

02:50.169 --> 02:51.296
and after.

02:52.463 --> 02:55.925
I am protecting mankind
from an extinction event.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.845
And if this pearl-clutching jury of my...

03:00.138 --> 03:03.308
peers wants to put me
behind bars for it,

03:03.391 --> 03:05.143
they are welcome to try.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.978
But, know this.

03:08.062 --> 03:10.481
I will always have my thumb on the scales.

03:11.608 --> 03:15.528
Alexander Joseph Luthor...

03:15.904 --> 03:18.323
you've been found guilty on all counts

03:18.656 --> 03:23.995
and will serve
31 consecutive life sentences.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.250
Maybe we should make it 32.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.652
Mr. Luthor!

03:55.735 --> 03:58.529
Sorry, I'm sorry. Mr. Luthor!

03:58.613 --> 04:00.156
Mr. Luthor!

04:26.599 --> 04:27.725
Wow.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.062
Nice prison you got here.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.231
It's for conjugal visits.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.026
But still, after this,
it's back to concrete and iron.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.611
Sounds lonely.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.446
Stryker's is a petri dish.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.240
Bottle city.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.326
I've even managed
to teach some of the inmates chess.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.662
I like mentoring.

04:48.329 --> 04:49.330
It's a waste.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.457
You're a once-in-a-generation mind

04:51.541 --> 04:55.461
and the only man standing
between us and total annihilation.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.716
You know, I used to write you letters.

04:59.841 --> 05:00.883
I read them.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.220
You're literate for a Manson girl.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.763
You are not Manson.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.766
And for the record,
I'm not just some "girl."

05:09.851 --> 05:13.187
I've got degrees from Yale
in literature and physics,

05:13.271 --> 05:16.316
and I am a former
Junior Miss North Carolina.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.442
I don't need your resume.

05:21.112 --> 05:26.326
Although, I may know someone who does.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.244
-Miss Tessmacher--
-Eve.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.704
Miss Tessmacher...

05:30.580 --> 05:33.166
I need you to do me a favor.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.335
What do you know about <i>CatCo</i> magazine?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.045
Their circulation's down?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.630
Jimmy Olsen works there.
He's been a thorn.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.341
But he's connected
to the second Kryptonian.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.095
And I happen to know that Cat Grant
needs a new assistant.

05:46.387 --> 05:49.432
A woman of your talents would have
no problem finding a job there.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.392
Consider it done.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.687
But you do know
there's a lot more that I can do--

05:54.771 --> 05:55.980
And you will.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.607
We're gonna make you undeniable.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.103
Warden...

06:36.562 --> 06:38.940
Did your husband enjoy
those Knights tickets?

06:39.857 --> 06:41.484
Oh, yes. Courtside?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.319
He felt like Nicholson.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.739
And, uh, the other inmates,

06:46.823 --> 06:49.158
they seemed to like
all that lobster you trucked in.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.702
Lobster is 18th-century peasant food,

06:52.036 --> 06:54.747
only fit for the indentured
and the incarcerated.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.501
I, uh, didn't know you did artwork.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.294
It's just geometry.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.756
<i>Hannibal Crossing the Alps.</i>

07:04.090 --> 07:06.300
So, what's it, like, represent?

07:07.677 --> 07:10.012
Boredom.  Can I help you, Warden?

07:10.388 --> 07:11.556
Sorry.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.600
You have a call from the Kaznian Embassy.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.428
Warden, I'm going to need
to leave for 72 hours.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.013
What? You can't just--

07:52.096 --> 07:56.517
Your mother still lives
at 245 Maple Drive, right?

07:56.684 --> 07:58.644
Bingo Night every Friday at St. Joseph's?

07:58.728 --> 08:02.356
We wouldn't want that awful Betty Byrom
woman to finally have a chance at winning,

08:02.857 --> 08:03.983
would we?

08:06.986 --> 08:08.321
Seventy-two hours.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.824
-How are you gonna leave without--
-Leave that to me.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.993
I'll need my effects and my tailor.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.037
Oh. And my jet.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.960
Rook to E-8.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.171
Queen to H-5.
Bishop to G-6.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.842
Queen to H-8.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.345
Checkmate.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.396
America.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.190
Alex.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.288
Alex.

10:33.924 --> 10:34.967
Kaznia.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.883
Alex...

13:13.667 --> 13:15.419
He has nothing to fear,

13:16.003 --> 13:17.505
and neither do you.

13:18.255 --> 13:21.258
My name is Lex.

13:22.676 --> 13:23.677
Alex?

13:25.763 --> 13:26.805
Sure.

13:27.890 --> 13:28.891
Alex.

13:35.189 --> 13:38.359
I can show her how to master her powers
and help you contain her.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.986
I know you're the man for the job.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.696
Lex Luthor.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.700
Foremost specialist on everything Krypton.

13:46.825 --> 13:49.537
You will make her Kaznia's weapon, hmm?

13:49.620 --> 13:51.247
She'll hate whomever you want.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.499
Operant conditioning
is a specialty of mine.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.293
But you'll need to follow my instructions
to the letter.

13:57.127 --> 14:00.172
You can't break a Kryptonian,
but maybe we can bend one.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.340
And for this?

14:01.423 --> 14:02.633
Money, as discussed.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.552
He's not as liquid as he used to be.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.513
I warn you, you are only a consultant.

14:07.596 --> 14:08.931
Cross my heart.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.766
That's the one who made her uncomfortable.

14:12.851 --> 14:13.894
Get rid of him.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.564
I will reassign him elsewhere on the base.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.982
She will not see him again.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.150
She can see through walls.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.655
Pyotr.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.490
Come here.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.088
Next time, don't flinch.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.728
Did they teach you any English?

14:56.896 --> 14:57.938
Little.

15:00.524 --> 15:01.734
Are you...

15:02.526 --> 15:05.487
angry at me?

15:06.196 --> 15:08.991
For saving a child? No.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.035
You did the right thing.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.704
I heard pain.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.957
I did not know my strength.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.168
Would you like to?

15:30.304 --> 15:34.308
Alex, your name is only thing I remember.

15:42.566 --> 15:45.277
Let's just say we were besties.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.462
I will tell you everything soon.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.255
Time's up, and I have to go.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.259
Go on.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.428
You need to see the world as they do.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.186
English.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.160
Pennies from heaven.
How does this happen? Clone?

16:35.411 --> 16:36.537
I think I know.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.664
It's called "Harun-El." Black Kryptonite.

16:38.747 --> 16:40.082
It splits Kryptonians in two.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.583
Supergirl must have
come into contact with it.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.627
She's a blank slate.
Doesn't share Supergirl's memories.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.212
We don't know exactly how this works yet.

16:45.295 --> 16:46.296
"We"?

16:46.672 --> 16:49.216
It's Lena, and she has more.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.136
Brava.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.304
I told you I'd be more useful at L-Corp
than CatCo.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.265
And how is my darling sister?

16:56.348 --> 16:58.684
Obsessed. About to have a breakthrough
with the Harun-El,

16:58.767 --> 17:00.602
but she hasn't produced results yet.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.187
See that she does.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.482
So do I stay and hang with the commies?

17:05.566 --> 17:06.984
What? No, you're driving.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.610
Oh, sure.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.115
So what's the play?

17:13.407 --> 17:14.450
Paper tigers.

17:14.533 --> 17:15.826
Um...

17:16.285 --> 17:17.286
Chinese idiom.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.414
Paper tigers threaten,
but are destroyed easily.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.875
Kaznia wants to move on the US.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.334
They're crazier than Russia.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.879
They wanna bring back
the glory days of the Soviet Union.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.881
So you wanna help them?

17:29.131 --> 17:30.632
I don't care about their politics.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.468
Regimes change, kings die.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.179
But if Kaznia attacks America,

17:36.388 --> 17:39.725
and I foil the attack,
America will hail me as a hero.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.228
To do that, I'm gonna need patsies
in both the East and the West.

17:43.312 --> 17:46.940
So, Otis, fetch your sister
and find me a real American.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.109
Someone charismatic, a radical.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.947
I think I know just the guy, Mr. Luthor.

17:54.948 --> 17:58.077
Name's Ben Lockwood, seems smart.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.704
I'm glad someone does.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.583
Wait, where are you going?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.168
Back to Stryker's.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.296
<i>Prison's the best alibi</i>
<i>the world has yet devised.</i>

18:10.005 --> 18:12.091
<i>And I'm about to need a lot of alibis.</i>

18:13.759 --> 18:17.429
<i>The</i> USS Yosemite <i>moved closer</i>
<i>to the Kaznian Sea today,</i>

18:17.513 --> 18:20.390
<i>placing pressure</i>
<i>on an already volatile area.</i>

18:20.557 --> 18:23.393
<i>Critics of President Baker,</i>
<i>who took office two weeks ago</i>

18:23.477 --> 18:28.023
<i>after President Marsdin's resignation,</i>
<i>are questioning his decisions.</i>

19:01.723 --> 19:02.808
Alex.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.563
When I was a boy,
I learned this game from a grand master.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.731
Anatoly Karpov.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.484
That's how I learned
to speak your language.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.154
Seems fitting
that it should teach you mine.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.489
I think your books handled that.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.158
Have they? Okay.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.285
Philip of Macedon.

19:22.035 --> 19:25.372
Ruled from 359 BC until his assassination.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.750
Father of Alexander the Great,
your namesake.

19:29.293 --> 19:32.921
<i>Philip had a small power base,</i>
<i>wanted to build an empire.</i>

19:33.005 --> 19:36.258
<i>But in the end, we only have one lifetime.</i>

19:36.425 --> 19:38.594
<i>-Alexander inherits his father's work,</i>

19:38.677 --> 19:41.680
<i>but he does more</i>
<i>than Philip ever could have dreamed.</i>

19:42.097 --> 19:43.640
He conquers the world.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.392
This appeals to you?

19:46.727 --> 19:47.853
You sound like my sister.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.397
Lena.

19:51.773 --> 19:52.774
Yes.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.276
You pay attention.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.862
You remind me of her sometimes.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.823
I used to think we were inseparable,

20:00.449 --> 20:02.075
that we were going to change everything.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.119
What happened?

20:05.162 --> 20:06.496
People disappoint.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.588
Not bad, though.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.716
You've read that one more than the others.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.426
<i>Gatsby.</i> Why?

20:20.427 --> 20:21.803
It's beautiful.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.056
Lush.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.767
I... I think that's the word.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.310
The language...

20:28.769 --> 20:31.313
It's hard to even
imagine the world that way.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.691
I didn't give it to you
because it's pretty.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.861
This is a book
about vapid, profligate fools.

20:38.695 --> 20:42.074
Money is always acquired
at someone else's expense.

20:43.450 --> 20:44.701
But you have money.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.537
You must. The way you come and go--

20:47.621 --> 20:48.664
I do.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.624
Because it is their weapon.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.001
The way their world works.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.169
Read it again.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.678
Thank you, Mikhail.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.014
Your mother, she...

21:06.598 --> 21:07.641
She's working?

21:07.724 --> 21:08.558
Yes.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.103
I'm sorry you have to be alone so much.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.188
I'll try to visit more.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.736
The night she saved you,

21:20.153 --> 21:21.363
why were those men attacking?

21:21.780 --> 21:23.156
They were thieves.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.034
It is just me and my mother.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.411
Why?

21:27.494 --> 21:28.996
My father was a bad man.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.081
He left us.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.667
I had a bad father, too.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.003
What did yours do?

21:36.086 --> 21:37.087
He stayed.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.215
I used to pray for a hero
like the one you got.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.592
Took a long time, but...

21:44.177 --> 21:45.304
here you are.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.181
Time to go.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.771
Sorry, Mikhail.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.529
I don't understand
why we are in such a hurry.

22:05.824 --> 22:06.950
What is that?

22:07.409 --> 22:08.618
We got to get you inside.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.914
What is happening to me?

22:14.291 --> 22:16.501
There is only one thing
on this Earth that can hurt you,
and the Americans
just seeded the skies with it.

22:20.630 --> 22:21.590
You will never
feel like this again.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.841
I will protect you.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.843
But there's something we have to do first.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.346
Your flesh is weak.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.931
It's the only time we can do this.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.607
Someday,

22:39.232 --> 22:40.317
you may have to match her.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.443
Who?

22:42.986 --> 22:45.197
It's time for you to know your full truth.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.908
You are strong.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.409
You are Kaznia.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.995
But you are also something more.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.705
That green flash you saw,

22:54.081 --> 22:55.791
it's poison to your species.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.959
Made of fragments of your home planet.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.546
You are one of the last
daughters of Krypton.

23:01.630 --> 23:02.756
Krypton?

23:04.091 --> 23:07.094
You will usher
in a new era of peace,

23:07.260 --> 23:08.303
equality.

23:08.386 --> 23:11.139
Nations unlike Kaznia,
who believe in greed,

23:11.223 --> 23:13.058
will rise against you,

23:13.391 --> 23:17.729
and its greatest champion
will stand between you and your work.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.414
I told you, English.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.375
You need to keep your accent.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.459
Why?

23:41.086 --> 23:42.546
You want me to go to America.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.589
Someday. You're not ready yet.

23:44.673 --> 23:45.841
Yes, I am.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.759
I want to see it.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.427
I want to know more.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.513
Who is this Supergirl...

23:52.556 --> 23:53.557
to me?

23:53.640 --> 23:55.142
Why does she look like me?

23:56.226 --> 23:57.310
Put simply,

23:58.019 --> 23:59.020
your sister.

24:01.022 --> 24:03.316
She has usurped
your position in the world.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.193
Taken from you.
Like your Lena.

24:06.987 --> 24:07.988
Yes.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.826
Maybe you should see more.

24:27.382 --> 24:28.592
National City.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.136
You know Kaznia, Krypton.

24:31.511 --> 24:33.847
Now you need to experience Babylon.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.108
Hey!

24:45.192 --> 24:46.026
Kid!

24:46.276 --> 24:47.277
What's your name?

24:47.694 --> 24:48.653
Linda.

24:49.654 --> 24:50.697
Linda Lee.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.908
Well, Linda Lee...

24:54.034 --> 24:56.203
Why don't you go on
and get us some more of this?

25:00.081 --> 25:01.166
Of course.

25:05.420 --> 25:06.630
What did you see?

25:07.839 --> 25:09.216
A pig trough.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.219
One of the men had a pin

25:13.053 --> 25:16.097
with the AmerTek insignia.
They make weapons.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.141
America's exports. Movies,

25:18.516 --> 25:19.726
and bombs.

25:20.352 --> 25:23.355
Kaznia suffers so that
Americans can live like this.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.692
And Supergirl defends those men?

25:27.776 --> 25:29.027
Yes, because she's...

25:30.278 --> 25:31.321
soft.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.616
Accustomed to a certain lifestyle.

25:36.284 --> 25:37.661
You wanna understand her?

25:37.744 --> 25:41.289
This is the place.
This is where Supergirl lives.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.792
Or, as some know her...

25:47.337 --> 25:48.755
Kara Danvers.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.723
One day, you may have to be just like her.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.141
Move like her, think like her.

26:00.475 --> 26:01.434
So...

26:02.102 --> 26:03.144
what do you see?

26:07.232 --> 26:09.067
She likes comfort.

26:13.196 --> 26:14.864
She is undisciplined.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.710
All of this is for her?

26:53.403 --> 26:55.739
She is like a princess in a tower.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.742
And on a reporter's salary.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.121
Someone is coming.

27:09.627 --> 27:10.628
Kara!

27:11.963 --> 27:12.881
Alex?

27:12.964 --> 27:14.799
I thought you were in Smallville.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.676
I mean, I specifically remember you

27:16.760 --> 27:19.763
asking me to take care
of your leafy dependents.

27:20.347 --> 27:23.391
Yeah, yes. Smallville. Yeah, I, uh...

27:24.100 --> 27:26.853
-I...
-You didn't cancel your vacation, did you?

27:27.395 --> 27:30.190
I told you that I would
hold down the fort at the DEO.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.858
I mean, but you are missed.

27:31.941 --> 27:34.152
No, of course,
I didn't cancel my vacation.

27:34.235 --> 27:37.781
I just... I forgot my journal.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.658
Look at me.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.912
Silly writer, without her journal.

27:44.371 --> 27:46.289
Okay, well, good.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.083
Well, you should...

27:48.166 --> 27:49.376
You should be going, right?

27:49.459 --> 27:52.128
-Yeah, okay. I will. Thank you, Alex.
-Okay.

27:52.712 --> 27:53.755
Okay.

27:55.256 --> 27:56.216
Bye.

27:56.424 --> 27:57.675
-Bye.
-See ya.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.182
Kara Danvers has an Alex, too?

28:04.432 --> 28:06.351
You have a lot in common
except for what counts.

28:06.434 --> 28:07.852
Field trip's over. I have to go back to--

28:08.019 --> 28:09.396
-To prison.
-Yes.

28:09.562 --> 28:11.856
Go back to Kaznia,
make sure you aren't seen.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.025
No one can know that you exist.

28:30.708 --> 28:33.378
<i>"Ms. Grant only threatened</i>
<i>to fire me six times today.</i>

28:33.670 --> 28:35.422
<i>I think she's warming to me."</i>

28:42.846 --> 28:45.140
<i>"Lena doesn't realize</i>
<i>how much potential she has.</i>

28:45.724 --> 28:47.475
<i>I hope now at least the world will."</i>

28:48.810 --> 28:50.228
Lena Luthor.

29:09.998 --> 29:10.999
Kara!

29:11.541 --> 29:13.752
What are you doing here?
I thought you were on vacation.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.463
I had to help Alex with something.

29:19.841 --> 29:20.842
Ms. Luthor.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.720
Ms. Luthor... Sorry to interrupt.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.139
You're needed in Lab C, and it can't wait.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.977
I'm sorry. But when you get back,
maybe a girls' night?

29:31.352 --> 29:32.437
-Big Belly Burger.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.063
Like your birthday, last year.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.315
Sold.
Hello, "Kara."

29:42.363 --> 29:43.740
Or should I say, <i>privet?</i>

29:44.115 --> 29:45.909
There is no way Alex sent you to L-Corp.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.119
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to meet his sister.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.830
Okay, well, you've met her,
so now get back to your nesting doll.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.040
I'm not ready.
America is...

29:55.418 --> 29:57.962
unsavory, but I'm not so sure
it's as bad as Alex...

29:58.046 --> 30:01.299
Oh, no. No, no, no. You are not
gonna go all apple pie-eating,

30:01.382 --> 30:03.510
flag-waving Philip Jennings on me.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.137
Kara Danvers wants to do good.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.723
She has compassion, she has friends.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.100
And Lena is one of them.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.143
Why is that?

30:15.605 --> 30:16.606
We've got a problem.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.441
Your little project's
got a mind of her own,

30:18.525 --> 30:20.944
and she's about to star-spangle you
right out of world domination.

30:21.027 --> 30:23.696
Panic is a bad color on you,
Miss Tessmacher.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.031
I can fix this.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.200
You and Otis will have to go to Kaznia.

30:27.283 --> 30:28.576
What? What for?

30:28.660 --> 30:31.162
Because that's where
the thing she loves most is.

30:31.579 --> 30:34.666
<i>And she's gonna be</i>
<i>ever so sad when the Americans</i>

30:34.749 --> 30:35.917
<i>take it away from her.</i>

30:40.171 --> 30:41.172
Hey, kid.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.684
Hey, sailor.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.657
<i>Missile engaging target.</i>

32:15.767 --> 32:17.101
Who would do this?

32:20.438 --> 32:21.564
You already know.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.166
AmerTek? The greedy Americans?

32:44.629 --> 32:46.255
Don't do this.

32:46.547 --> 32:49.676
Listen to me, Luthors bide their time.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.010
This is just an American--

33:04.774 --> 33:06.818
Please stop! No!

33:16.619 --> 33:18.621
You could have
compromised all of our work!

33:18.705 --> 33:21.082
-They killed Mikhail!
-What is one life?

33:21.332 --> 33:23.334
One life is nothing next to the world.

33:23.543 --> 33:26.212
You risked everything,
and you did not listen to me.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.880
You don't give me commands.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.424
I am helping you.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.801
They saw your face.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.721
If you were identified,
the world would hunt you down!

33:35.513 --> 33:37.181
I'll make this look like an accident,

33:37.265 --> 33:40.143
sabotage, friendly fire...
I will clean up your mess!

33:40.226 --> 33:41.686
Is that what you think of me?

33:42.937 --> 33:45.481
That I am some pet you clean up after?

33:45.565 --> 33:46.607
Of course not.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.736
Some soldier then,
Alexander's conquering army.

33:50.611 --> 33:51.863
What am I?

33:51.946 --> 33:53.156
Why am I here?

33:53.614 --> 33:55.408
Why does Kara Danvers have an Alex?

33:55.491 --> 33:57.660
And why is she friends with your sister?

34:00.496 --> 34:01.998
That's what this is about.

34:03.082 --> 34:04.417
This is about Lena.

34:08.421 --> 34:09.964
I thought you were stronger.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.176
But... People disappoint.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.429
I'm done here.

34:22.810 --> 34:24.103
Oh, I died once.

34:27.482 --> 34:31.152
So, I believe in second chances, but...

34:31.527 --> 34:34.238
if you see a bald guy...

34:36.616 --> 34:37.825
Any bald guy,

34:38.242 --> 34:40.536
you lie on the floor,
you pretend you're dead.

34:43.372 --> 34:44.248
Okay?

35:01.933 --> 35:02.975
What?

35:05.186 --> 35:06.312
What kind of illness?

35:11.609 --> 35:12.735
- Lex.
-We pushed her too far.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.196
Maybe the Black Kryptonite
caused unchecked cell growth.

35:15.279 --> 35:16.364
-That'd be cancer-symptomatic.
-Lex.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.200
It could be a telomere problem.
We need to stabilize the senescence--

35:19.283 --> 35:20.493
-Lex!
-What?
Oh, right.

35:22.662 --> 35:23.663
The Harun-El.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.456
It made her.

35:25.998 --> 35:27.834
It might stabilize her. Bring it to me.

35:27.917 --> 35:28.793
It's not ready yet.

35:28.876 --> 35:31.129
Lena's trial
still has a 100% mortality rate.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.964
-Then I'll solve it.
-The girl is dying.

35:33.047 --> 35:34.590
Then what do you suggest I do?

35:34.799 --> 35:37.176
She is everything I have worked for!
She's a...

35:38.219 --> 35:39.345
A miracle.

35:39.428 --> 35:42.390
The skies opened up and gave her to me.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.852
I can't lose her.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.814
I have an idea,
but you're not gonna like it.

35:50.189 --> 35:51.315
-What we--
-You're right.

35:52.441 --> 35:53.901
I have to give myself cancer.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.406
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That is not what I was gonna say.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.533
No, you were going to tell me
that I need to work with Lena.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.785
And you're right, except she won't buy it.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.328
She'll never work with me, but...

36:04.996 --> 36:07.707
-she will save me.

36:08.499 --> 36:09.876
No! Lex, no.

36:26.934 --> 36:28.102
- Hey, sis.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.521
I hate what you've done with the place.

36:36.652 --> 36:38.112
I'll be direct.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.447
Black Kryptonite.

36:39.530 --> 36:40.615
The Harun-El.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.366
You have it, and I need it.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.493
You know it doesn't grow back hair.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.330
Don't be pedestrian.

36:47.914 --> 36:48.915
You're a Luthor.

36:48.998 --> 36:50.958
I seem to remember
some disagreement on that point.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.043
Not from me.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.420
I swabbed your cheek
the day after you moved in.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.547
I've always been interested in our genes.

36:56.797 --> 36:58.174
Strengths, weaknesses...

36:59.175 --> 37:00.259
Alcoholism.

37:01.969 --> 37:03.262
So, that's your plan.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.264
Come here to talk about our drunk father?

37:05.348 --> 37:07.225
What's next, you tell me you love me?

37:07.308 --> 37:09.435
Love is valueless. I respect you.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.854
No, you don't get to do that. You can't
just come in here and take what you want.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.189
Lena, I'm a hologram.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.316
I can't take anything.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.777
But I get it.
You don't wanna give up your research.

37:18.819 --> 37:21.781
It's cozy, the comfort of obsession.

37:22.531 --> 37:23.741
I'm not like you.

37:25.117 --> 37:26.744
I wanna help people.

37:26.911 --> 37:27.912
I'm people.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.540
And you're using the black rock
to make super-soldiers.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.251
Who is that helping?

37:34.126 --> 37:36.545
I've had some time, done some thinking,

37:37.171 --> 37:39.757
-some leaf-turning-over--
-It's a big leaf.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.551
Don't do what I did.

37:44.387 --> 37:47.139
Don't harm when you can heal.

37:49.934 --> 37:53.729
Oh. I just realized you haven't asked me
why I need the black rock.

37:53.813 --> 37:56.023
-I assumed homicide.
-Just the opposite.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.651
I'm dying.

38:11.789 --> 38:12.748
Take care of her.

38:26.721 --> 38:27.638
Well...

38:28.472 --> 38:29.807
Here goes everything.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.374
Alex?

38:57.376 --> 38:58.919
I thought you were gone.

39:00.629 --> 39:01.547
Well...

39:02.590 --> 39:04.550
You made me very, very angry.

39:05.718 --> 39:08.429
But I promised that
I wouldn't let you get sick again.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.141
You saved me.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.020
I had a lot invested in you.

39:18.230 --> 39:20.232
And I shouldn't have left
the way that I did.

39:22.651 --> 39:23.986
This is not about Lena.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.323
This is about you and me.

39:30.284 --> 39:31.494
Can you forgive me?

39:34.455 --> 39:35.581
Supergirl...

39:36.415 --> 39:38.042
acts on her emotions.

39:38.584 --> 39:40.503
It's selfish.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.046
Ugly.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.048
I will not be her.

39:44.965 --> 39:46.217
I will be me.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.760
I will be disciplined.

39:48.594 --> 39:49.887
I will follow you,

39:51.389 --> 39:52.681
and destroy her.

39:55.393 --> 39:59.480
Do you remember that story
about Alexander the Great and his father?

39:59.939 --> 40:00.940
I remember.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.858
You thought I was Alexander.

40:04.360 --> 40:05.403
But I'm Philip.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.989
I only get one lifetime.

40:10.866 --> 40:12.034
But you're...

40:13.661 --> 40:14.745
forever.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.165
My gift to the world,

40:18.833 --> 40:20.126
my legacy...

40:39.979 --> 40:40.980
What's wrong?

40:41.230 --> 40:42.273
Lex Luthor.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.732
He's free.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.235
I tried to stop him, but he got away.

40:46.402 --> 40:47.820
-What?
-Lena.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.488
Does she know?

40:49.572 --> 40:50.531
I don't know.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.283
Okay, I will find her.
You get J'onn and find Lex.
