01:12.807 --> 01:18.077

(pensive music)

01:22.783 --> 01:23.682
- Ryan?

01:23.684 --> 01:24.516
(hand banging)

01:24.518 --> 01:25.818
Ryan?

01:25.820 --> 01:27.586
Hey, it's me, open the door.

01:30.825 --> 01:32.525
Ryan?

01:32.526 --> 01:34.226

(phone ringing)

06:09.103 --> 06:11.970
(phone chimes)

06:19.680 --> 06:24.116
- [Voicemail] Hey Dad, just
wondering where you are.

06:24.118 --> 06:26.752
Looks like you didn't
come home last night,

06:26.754 --> 06:29.054
but you should know Mom's
pretty pissed about it.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.023
I just hope everything's okay.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.527
Just give me a call.

06:35.529 --> 06:40.599
(Leigh vomiting)

06:44.605 --> 06:47.439
(birds chirping)

06:47.441 --> 06:52.511

(Leigh whimpering)

07:56.944 --> 07:59.845
(engine rumbling)

08:08.522 --> 08:09.221
- Hey.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.493
It's best not to mention
last night, all right?

08:15.229 --> 08:17.963
It would just complicate things.

08:20.567 --> 08:21.166
- Well, who was he?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.200
- I don't know.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.704
He was probably lookin'
for somethin' to steal.

08:27.608 --> 08:28.573
- Are you okay?

08:29.276 --> 08:30.976
- Yeah, I'm all right.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.910
It's not as bad as it looks.

08:33.947 --> 08:37.649
- What happened to him?

08:37.650 --> 08:41.285
- He, he ran off
right after you left.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.221
- I would have stayed.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.890
- No.

08:44.892 --> 08:48.260
You did the right thing. I
didn't want you gettin' hurt.

08:48.262 --> 08:49.160
Hey?

08:51.965 --> 08:53.131
I know you would have.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.133
Thank you.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.942
(shop bell dings)

09:07.781 --> 09:09.214
- You must be Leigh.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.815
- Where's Officer Boyd?

09:10.817 --> 09:13.552
- Officer Boyd is no
longer with the department.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.154
I'm your new probation
officer, Ryan.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.889
Nathan Parrish.

09:17.891 --> 09:18.790
- Hi.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.092
- Can I get you something?

09:21.094 --> 09:21.927
- Oh, we won't be long.

09:21.929 --> 09:22.761
Thank you though.

09:22.763 --> 09:23.929
- Bring him a coke.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.617
Is everything all right?

09:28.618 --> 09:30.301
- Yeah, just got a
lot goin' on today.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.772
- [Nathan] How are things Ryan?

09:34.975 --> 09:36.207
- Fine.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.576
- Broken any laws
since last check in?

09:38.579 --> 09:39.311
- No.

09:39.313 --> 09:40.045
- [Nathan] Anymore fights?

09:40.047 --> 09:41.146
- [Ryan] No Sir.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.015
- You the one that hit your mom?

09:45.118 --> 09:46.952
- It was an accident at work.

09:46.954 --> 09:47.852
- That true?

09:48.622 --> 09:49.321
- Yeah.

09:49.323 --> 09:50.221
Yes Sir.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.062
- What do you do when
your mom's at work?

09:57.064 --> 09:58.763
- He works at the shop with me.

09:58.765 --> 09:59.598
- Where's that?

09:59.600 --> 10:00.231
- Tiller's Auto.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.166
- Husband's?

10:01.168 --> 10:02.200
- Ex.

10:03.003 --> 10:03.835
It's mine now.

10:03.836 --> 10:04.668
He's not involved.

10:04.671 --> 10:05.870
- Why not?

10:05.872 --> 10:07.272
- 'Cause he's in jail.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.677
- Hm.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.913
Like father like son, huh?

10:17.084 --> 10:18.350
Drugs, alcohol?

10:19.753 --> 10:20.852
- No Sir.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.723
- It's better that
you tell me now.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.859
(patrons chattering)

10:31.798 --> 10:32.831
- He's a good kid.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.434
- You blinded a boy
in his left eye.

10:35.435 --> 10:38.036
- The kid was pickin' on him
about his dad bein' sent off.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.337
Supposed to not fight back?

10:39.339 --> 10:40.672
- I got folders full of people

10:40.674 --> 10:42.007
with reasons for what they did.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.042
It doesn't put the
skin back on the cat.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.280
File has a note from the court,

10:49.282 --> 10:52.017
says that you're behind
on your restitution.

10:52.019 --> 10:52.984
- Yeah.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.553
- Now if you don't get that paid

10:54.554 --> 10:56.121
it's gonna be a hell of a
time clearin' his record.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.389
- Things have been tight.

10:57.391 --> 10:58.790
I'll catch up.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.407
- I've been doin' this
a long time Miss Tiller.

11:15.409 --> 11:17.275
Good kids don't end up here.

11:21.782 --> 11:22.914
- He doesn't know you.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.888
You mean to pee on that cup?

11:34.161 --> 11:35.994
Atta boy.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.897
(engine rumbling)

11:46.106 --> 11:49.074
(doors slamming)

11:49.076 --> 11:51.843
(wind whistling)

11:59.720 --> 12:03.021
- Must be nice bein'
the boss's kid.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.090
Sleep late, ramble in whenever.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.962
- [Leigh] You good?

12:10.963 --> 12:13.864
- Hey, I got a truck over
here that needs your help.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.268
- What's wrong with it?

12:17.270 --> 12:18.403
- [Rey] You tell me, kid.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.841
(pensive music)

12:36.323 --> 12:41.392
(keyboard keys clacking)
(pensive music)

13:05.285 --> 13:08.386
(door unlatching)

13:10.290 --> 13:12.223
What's up with Ryan?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.359
- Nothin', just...

13:16.029 --> 13:18.997
we had that meeting with
the PO this mornin'.

13:18.999 --> 13:19.831
- Is everything okay?

13:19.833 --> 13:20.532
- It's fine.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.335
It's nothin'.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.470
- [Rey] Bullshit.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.975
- I was, I was workin' too fast.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.277
You know, took a little fall.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.412
I'm all right.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.683
- Who did that?

13:38.684 --> 13:41.418
- There was just, there
was a break in last night.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.189
Some junkie probably
thinkin' the place was empty.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.590
I guess I startled him.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.292
It's not a big deal, all right?

13:47.294 --> 13:49.961
He lost interest as soon

13:49.963 --> 13:51.930
as he realized it
wasn't an easy score.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.164
- Did you call the cops?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.098
Maybe we could pull the
tapes in the cameras.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.200
- [Leigh] Like I said,

13:55.201 --> 13:56.301
it's not a big deal.
- Leigh, don't do somethin'--

13:56.303 --> 13:57.602
- Just let it go.

14:00.974 --> 14:01.606
I'm sorry.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.408
I know you're just...

14:08.281 --> 14:10.315
It's just a break in, all right?

14:13.253 --> 14:14.352
We don't need a bad reputation

14:14.354 --> 14:17.455
with the few
customers we got left.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.996
- Hey, your dad came by.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.368
- When?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.269
- Earlier today.

14:34.341 --> 14:37.308
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

14:37.310 --> 14:42.380
(door latches)
(pensive music)

14:49.890 --> 14:51.556
(computer thuds)

14:51.558 --> 14:56.628

15:50.483 --> 15:51.516

15:51.518 --> 15:56.587
(birds chirping)

16:00.293 --> 16:05.363
(children chattering)
(dog barking)

16:13.540 --> 16:18.609
(police siren)

16:34.494 --> 16:35.693
- What are you doin' out here?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.095
- You ever do that
again I'll report you.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.430
- I'm a year from
forced retirement kid,

16:39.432 --> 16:41.265
what do you think
they're gonna do to me?

16:43.503 --> 16:44.402
What happened to you?

16:44.404 --> 16:45.770
- What do you want?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.241
- I came by earlier.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.211
I know that Ryan's
appointment was this mornin'.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.078
- He's fine.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.547
- That Parrish is
a pain in the ass.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.482
- I said he's fine.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.254
- I was thinkin' that maybe
Ryan could come see me sometime,

17:03.256 --> 17:05.223
take him off your hands
for a couple hours.

17:05.224 --> 17:06.523
- I gotta go.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.226
(engine starting)

17:08.228 --> 17:10.661
- Would you at least tell him
that I was askin' after him?

17:12.332 --> 17:14.632
- I'll see you around, Dad.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.202
- Well, see you around.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.239
(engine rumbling)

17:26.546 --> 17:30.214
(cellphone chiming)

17:33.453 --> 17:36.387
(pensive music)

17:59.646 --> 18:04.649

18:16.663 --> 18:21.732

(thunder rumbling)

18:22.769 --> 18:27.839
(engine rumbling)

18:32.145 --> 18:35.246
- How come we never
take your police car?

18:35.248 --> 18:36.547
- [Richard] 'Cause
you aren't big enough

18:36.549 --> 18:38.449
to ride in the front yet.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.283
- So?

18:39.285 --> 18:40.518
I'll ride in the back.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.453
- [Richard] The back
is for bad guys only.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.472
(radio static crackling)

18:44.473 --> 18:46.490
- [CB Radio] Hey Richard,
you there? (radio static)

18:46.493 --> 18:49.427
I got a situation I
could use your help with.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.896
- [Richard] Ain't really
a good time for it.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.631
- [Man Whispering] ... the
place on Old Broughton.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.732
Right.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.435
Hm.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.771
I gotta make a quick
stop before dinner, kid.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.842
(thunder rumbling)

19:04.844 --> 19:07.745

("The Journey")

20:26.326 --> 20:30.528
¶ Down the dark
highway, I travel on ¶

20:30.530 --> 20:34.532
¶ To places I can't stay ¶

20:34.534 --> 20:37.635
¶ Like the tide,
I'm pulled along ¶

20:37.637 --> 20:41.539
¶ Let Truth show me the way ¶

(music swells)

20:58.791 --> 21:00.858

21:02.729 --> 21:03.561
- Come on, man.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.629
- Hey, come on.

21:04.631 --> 21:05.496
- Just let go of me.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.330
- Hey, you look good.

21:06.332 --> 21:07.331
- Just get the...

21:07.333 --> 21:08.532
(elbow slaps)
(Colt groans)

21:08.534 --> 21:09.600
- [Colt's Friend] What
the fuck was that?

21:09.602 --> 21:12.436
- God damn it, man.
- Fuck!

21:20.513 --> 21:22.680
(Leigh panting)

21:22.682 --> 21:25.549
(Leigh screams)

21:25.551 --> 21:26.984
- [Customer] Ma'am?

21:27.854 --> 21:28.786
- I'm sorry, what?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.855
- Do I have to do it all now?

21:32.692 --> 21:33.958
- Oh, uh...

21:36.596 --> 21:38.863
It looks like you
could wait a month

21:38.865 --> 21:41.599
or two on the axles if you want.

21:56.849 --> 21:57.915
- Hey.

22:00.019 --> 22:00.818
Sorry.

22:02.722 --> 22:03.854
- What is it?

22:03.856 --> 22:05.723
- Hoffman's called again.

22:05.725 --> 22:06.991
- [Leigh] I'll handle it.

22:06.993 --> 22:07.925
- They're gonna quit
fillin' our orders.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.761
- I said I'll fuckin' handle it.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.475
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.780
- Why don't you take
off early today?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.449
Go soak in the tub or somethin'.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.384
- You sure?

22:34.754 --> 22:38.823
- Hell of a lot better than
you yellin' at me all day.

22:40.526 --> 22:41.492
- Yeah, all right.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.528
Sounds nice.

22:49.369 --> 22:50.368
I'll be straight tomorrow.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.836
- I know you will.

22:54.107 --> 22:56.974
(engine rumbling)

23:01.147 --> 23:02.913
- [Ryan] What were
you arguin' about?

23:02.915 --> 23:04.548
- What?

23:04.550 --> 23:08.018
- With the man who broke in.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.521
- Uh, I wasn't arguin'.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.956
I was tellin' him to leave.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.826
- It sounded like you
were fightin' about money.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.728
- No, he was high.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.697
He wasn't makin' any sense.

23:19.699 --> 23:20.664
- He used to work with Dad.

23:20.666 --> 23:21.866
- Ryan.

23:21.868 --> 23:22.800
- [Ryan] Why did you
say you didn't know him?

23:22.802 --> 23:24.935
- Can we just drop it please?

23:31.644 --> 23:34.645
Look, all that stuff
with your father...

23:36.916 --> 23:38.516
it's behind us, all right?

23:39.685 --> 23:42.019
I want it to stay that way.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.092
- Where are we goin'?

23:49.862 --> 23:52.029
- I need to take
care of soemthin'.

23:53.166 --> 23:57.101
You're gonna spend a few
hours with your grandfather.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.682
(birds chirping)

24:19.592 --> 24:20.991
- How you doin' kid?

24:20.993 --> 24:21.892
- Good.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.696
- See that bird right there?

24:25.698 --> 24:26.897
- [Ryan] Yeah.

24:26.899 --> 24:27.932
- It's a pheasant,
I just got it.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.534
Got some homing pigeons too.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.040
Tell you what Ryan, why
don't you go up to the house.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.708
I just made some iced tea.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.777
Why don't you see if there's
anything on TV you wanna watch,

24:39.779 --> 24:41.011
I'll be right with you.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.048
- Okay.

24:52.625 --> 24:55.726
- I don't let him
watch anything R-rated.

24:55.728 --> 24:56.861
- Okay.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.028
- And nothin' too violent.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.029
- Right.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.233
I was surprised
to get your call.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.203
- Well, some time to
myself sounded nice.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.671
- Hm.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.607
I've had about as much
of that as I care for.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.048
- I'll be back in a few hours.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.051
- Take your time.

25:26.158 --> 25:29.159
(Leigh knocking)

25:32.899 --> 25:33.797
- What's up?

25:36.002 --> 25:36.901
Rough week?

25:46.112 --> 25:49.046
This is stronger shit
than you're used to.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.047
- Thanks.

25:50.049 --> 25:50.981
- Thank you.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.149
- How much should I take?

25:54.120 --> 25:57.187
- Uh, how much trouble you
lookin' to get off your back?

25:59.559 --> 26:00.824
Those are fives.

26:00.826 --> 26:02.126
You start with one,
you'll be good.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.027
- Hey?

26:04.330 --> 26:07.164
You uh, you mind if
I hang out for a bit?

26:08.868 --> 26:10.267
I just need someplace quiet.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.904
- Yeah, uh, knock yourself out.

26:17.977 --> 26:21.211
Oh, uh, I wanted
to tell you I uh,

26:21.213 --> 26:23.581
I finish my parol in August.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.349
I think I might head
back to Michigan.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.219
I'll set you up with a new guy.

26:29.221 --> 26:30.688
- You tell Jesse?

26:31.791 --> 26:33.657
- Your ex and I don't
really chat anymore.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.159
You?

26:41.734 --> 26:43.067
(Reed sighs)

26:43.069 --> 26:45.102
This place is a mess.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.109
(pensive music)

27:06.959 --> 27:09.026
- Hey, did you
um, did you notice

27:09.028 --> 27:11.295
if I was wearin' a necklace
when I came in here?

27:12.398 --> 27:14.365
- No, I don't think so.

27:18.971 --> 27:19.903
- Yeah, okay.

27:19.905 --> 27:22.239
Just call me if you find it.

27:30.816 --> 27:31.715
Okay.

27:36.822 --> 27:37.755
Okay.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.068
- Can I help you?

27:51.070 --> 27:53.704
- Yeah, I was uh, I
was in here last night.

27:53.706 --> 27:55.072
- Yeah, I remember.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.241
I spent a half hour
cleanin' up blood and glass.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.076
- Do you um, did
you happen to find

27:59.078 --> 28:01.412
a necklace while you
were cleanin' up?

28:01.414 --> 28:02.312
Silver?

28:13.359 --> 28:15.159
Okay.

28:15.161 --> 28:15.993
Thanks.

28:15.995 --> 28:20.297
(objects rustling)

28:20.299 --> 28:21.699
It's not in here.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.200
- Then I guess I didn't find it.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.336
- Please, it's um, it's
a little silver chain,

28:26.338 --> 28:27.738
had a wrench on it.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.651
It's really important.

28:29.652 --> 28:31.563
- Well, you maybe
you should check

28:31.564 --> 28:33.475
with that fella you
were grindin' your
snatch on last night.

28:49.195 --> 28:53.097
(engine rumbling)

28:59.238 --> 29:04.308
(children playing)

29:20.526 --> 29:23.327
(Leigh knocking)

29:24.864 --> 29:29.933
(shots firing in the distance)

29:35.207 --> 29:36.373
- That's not bad.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.544
You see how the water's
runnin' toward the creek?

29:41.914 --> 29:44.815
You always wanna watch
a suspect's feet.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.250
See if he's about to run.

29:46.252 --> 29:50.053
You see which foot
his weight is on,

29:50.055 --> 29:51.288
then lead him that
way just by a hair.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.023
(shot firing)
(water splashing)

29:53.025 --> 29:54.057
- Time to go Ryan.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.795
- Just let me try one more time.

29:57.797 --> 29:58.495
- Ryan.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.235
- We'll get 'em next time.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.906
- You haven't changed a bit.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.209
- Hey.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.143
Hey!

30:13.145 --> 30:14.311
What's stuck in your craw?

30:15.347 --> 30:17.047
- Not half a day with the kid

30:17.049 --> 30:19.116
and you got him picturing
bullets goin' through heads.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.701
- He said he'd never
shot a revolver.

30:20.702 --> 30:22.285
- [Leigh] And you thought
it was your job to fix that?

30:22.288 --> 30:24.254
- I think that he hadn't
seen his dad in three years.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.389
What's goin' on with you?

30:26.992 --> 30:28.292
- You're a poison.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.560
That's what's goin' on.

30:31.096 --> 30:33.463
- The boy needs to know how
to take care of himself,

30:33.465 --> 30:35.432
things at the shop
bein' how they are.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.508
- Beatin' around the
bush doesn't suit you.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.443
- Ryan told me there
was a break in.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.378
- Boy needs to keep
his mouth shut.

30:48.380 --> 30:49.313
- Easy.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.981
He was scared.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.382
- He say anything else?

30:53.352 --> 30:54.418
- He didn't seem much
for talkin' about it.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.353
Why didn't you tell me?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.522
- 'Cause it doesn't concern you.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.057
- You forget what I do?

31:02.361 --> 31:03.493
- No.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.928
No, I didn't forget.

31:05.998 --> 31:08.365
- If you got somethin'
to say, say it.

31:13.239 --> 31:14.438
- This was a mistake.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.210
(door slams)

31:20.212 --> 31:21.545
- [Richard] Ryan?

31:27.419 --> 31:28.585
- Hey.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.053
- What?

31:30.055 --> 31:31.455
- I'm just lookin' out for you.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.324
- By makin' sure I
can't defend myself?

31:34.326 --> 31:37.027
- By makin' sure you have
the right influences.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.996
- Well, I can make
my own choices.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.465
- Yeah, you've done a real
great job of that so far.

31:46.438 --> 31:47.471
(door slams)

31:47.473 --> 31:48.505
Shit.

31:51.277 --> 31:52.075
Ryan?

31:52.077 --> 31:57.114
(pensive music)

31:57.950 --> 31:59.650
Hey, have you seen my necklace?

32:21.974 --> 32:27.044
(objects clattering)

32:40.459 --> 32:45.529
(crickets chirping)
(pensive music)

33:00.112 --> 33:05.148
(train horn blaring)

33:24.336 --> 33:26.703
(trunk slams)

33:52.631 --> 33:57.701
(engine rumbling)

34:05.444 --> 34:07.577
- [Travis] Hey Mom, Dad's home.

34:07.579 --> 34:11.648
- [Dani] Tell him to sleep
on the fucking couch.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.453
(Leigh gasps)

34:16.455 --> 34:19.255
- [Travis] Hey
Dad, you in there?

34:24.362 --> 34:25.262
Dad?

34:26.498 --> 34:31.568
(Travis grimaces)

34:33.739 --> 34:34.804
Oh fuck, no.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.474
Mom!

34:38.476 --> 34:40.077
Mom!

34:40.079 --> 34:45.148
(Leigh panting)

35:42.407 --> 35:47.477
(thunder cracking)
(rain pattering)

35:52.584 --> 35:57.654
(girl humming)
(rain pattering)

36:04.596 --> 36:06.796
- What are you drawin'?

36:07.733 --> 36:09.366
It's a circle.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.867
It gets bigger and bigger.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.736
Like a fingerprint.

36:14.606 --> 36:15.839
(glass shattering)

36:15.841 --> 36:20.911
(pensive music)

36:25.651 --> 36:26.550
Hey.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.362
(shot firing)

36:50.776 --> 36:51.808
(Rey knocking)

36:51.810 --> 36:52.642
- Leigh?

36:52.644 --> 36:54.277
You in there?

36:54.279 --> 36:56.980
(door unlatching)

36:58.417 --> 36:59.349
Oh, thank God.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.817
I've been tryin' your cell.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.452
We had another break in.

37:05.357 --> 37:06.790
Did you sleep here?

37:06.792 --> 37:08.758
- Shit.

37:08.760 --> 37:12.295
- [Rey] Customers, no customers,
we gotta call the police.

37:12.297 --> 37:14.397
- There um, there
wasn't a break in.

37:17.736 --> 37:18.719
- What?

37:18.720 --> 37:19.703
- I was lookin' for somethin'.

37:20.706 --> 37:21.838
I meant to clean up.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.240
I guess I just fell asleep.

37:32.684 --> 37:33.984
Rey.

37:33.986 --> 37:35.285
- [Rey] I'm goin' out.

37:38.857 --> 37:43.927
(tires on gravel)

37:55.874 --> 37:57.307
- Spring cleanin'?

37:57.309 --> 37:58.775
- I thought I made
myself pretty clear.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.912
- [Richard] I'm starting to
remember why we don't talk much.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.748
(Leigh sighs)

38:04.750 --> 38:07.617
- I can think of plenty of
reasons we don't talk much.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.887
- Jesus kid, I've seen priests
less hung up on old sins.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.723
- You just come by to complain
about how you're treated?

38:16.862 --> 38:17.727
- Where's Ryan?

38:17.729 --> 38:18.795
- [Leigh] He's not here.

38:23.502 --> 38:27.537
- The other day when I saw
you out by the trailer park,

38:28.740 --> 38:31.808
you never said what you
were doin' out there.

38:31.810 --> 38:32.842
- The truck was over heatin'.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.744
I was lettin' it cool.

38:35.714 --> 38:36.546
- Horse shit.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.447
Try harder.

38:38.917 --> 38:39.949
- I don't know what
you want from me,

38:39.951 --> 38:41.384
so if you don't mind...

38:41.386 --> 38:43.753
- A fella turned
up dead yesterday,

38:43.755 --> 38:45.922
about 100 yards from where
your truck overheated.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.724
- [Leigh] Hm, that so?

38:48.694 --> 38:49.793
- Name was Cobb.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.329
- That supposed
to mean somethin'?

38:52.331 --> 38:53.863
- It ought to.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.799
He used to run stolen cars
through here with your ex.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.801
- Well, if you think Jesse
had somethin' to do with it,

38:57.803 --> 38:59.469
you know where to find him.

38:59.471 --> 39:02.372
- Tell me you don't know
how he got dead, Leigh.

39:02.374 --> 39:03.473
- You know what?

39:03.475 --> 39:04.908
Fuck you.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.911
- You put that God damn tire
down and you look at me!

39:07.913 --> 39:10.847
(pensive music)

39:19.758 --> 39:21.091
(Leigh sniffles)

39:21.093 --> 39:22.092
Jesus Christ.

39:26.398 --> 39:27.764
- I don't know what to do.

39:29.668 --> 39:30.867
- What the fuck happened?

39:31.903 --> 39:33.870
- He broke into the shop.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.806
He musta not known I was here.

39:37.976 --> 39:41.945
When he saw me he
just, he went crazy,

39:41.947 --> 39:43.046
like he was on somethin'.

39:45.384 --> 39:46.616
And I grabbed a wrench.

39:47.953 --> 39:48.952
- You...

39:52.491 --> 39:53.957
Where's the wrench?

39:53.959 --> 39:54.891
- It's gone.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.027
- Why didn't you report it?

39:59.531 --> 40:00.830
- I don't know.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.066
I mean I panicked.

40:05.470 --> 40:07.470
I, I thought if they
made the connection

40:07.472 --> 40:09.906
with Jesse they'd take the shop.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.912
- Why did you take the
body back to the trailer?

40:15.914 --> 40:17.013
- 'Cause he has a family.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.849
- Who the fuck cares?

40:19.851 --> 40:22.719
- I couldn't just
disappear a man like that.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.154
Leave his people wonderin'.

40:24.156 --> 40:25.488
- Well that's great Leigh.

40:25.490 --> 40:26.790
Now his people know.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.024
- I know it was stupid.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.459
- You're damn right
it was stupid.

40:29.461 --> 40:31.661
You bury it, ya burn it.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.863
Shit, you dump it in a lake.

40:33.865 --> 40:34.664
- This isn't your problem.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.434
- You're my daughter.

40:37.436 --> 40:38.935
This is my problem.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.804
- I don't want your help.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.205
- You're a master criminal now?

40:43.175 --> 40:44.607
Hm?

40:44.609 --> 40:45.875
You cover your tracks
pretty thoroughly?

40:45.877 --> 40:47.210
- [Leigh] I didn't say that.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.945
- What about that camera
up on the wall behind me?

40:48.947 --> 40:50.713
Is that connected to anything?

40:50.715 --> 40:51.981
- No.

40:51.983 --> 40:52.816
- You think that he
took any of your skin

40:52.818 --> 40:53.983
with him to the morgue?

40:53.985 --> 40:56.920
What about fingerprints,
what about hair?

40:56.922 --> 40:58.855
Did anybody see
you actin' strange?

40:58.857 --> 41:01.624
You tell me they're not gonna
find your DNA on his pecker.

41:01.626 --> 41:02.525
- Just stop it!

41:04.696 --> 41:05.962
(Richard sighs)

41:05.964 --> 41:07.063
- Leigh.

41:13.472 --> 41:14.771
- What do I do?

41:16.708 --> 41:18.641
- You the prayin' kind?

41:23.715 --> 41:25.482
I'll go see what I can learn.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.087
I need a fuckin' drink.

41:33.625 --> 41:36.059
(somber music)

41:40.165 --> 41:45.235
(pensive music)

41:58.583 --> 42:00.216
Ryan?

42:00.218 --> 42:05.221
(pensive music)
(door unlatching)

42:08.093 --> 42:11.561
(bottles clinking)

42:11.563 --> 42:12.262
Oh, Ryan.

42:13.598 --> 42:14.297
Hey.

42:15.267 --> 42:16.165
Sorry.

42:18.970 --> 42:21.070
- [Ryan] You gonna lecture me
about not comin' this morning?

42:21.072 --> 42:24.641
- Hey, listen, I was thinkin',
we should get outta here.

42:24.643 --> 42:27.977
Just take a little vacation.

42:27.979 --> 42:30.096
- What are you talkin' about?

42:30.097 --> 42:32.214
- I just mean when was the last
time we just went somewhere?

42:32.217 --> 42:34.150
- [Ryan] What about the shop?

42:34.152 --> 42:35.585
- Well, Rey can take
care of the shop

42:35.587 --> 42:37.687
or we'll close it
for a couple weeks.

42:37.689 --> 42:38.288
- A couple weeks?

42:38.290 --> 42:39.222
- Yeah.

42:39.224 --> 42:40.623
Let's just go somewhere okay?

42:40.625 --> 42:44.761
Let's forget about cars
and school and work.

42:44.763 --> 42:45.595
We can go anywhere.

42:45.597 --> 42:46.329
You name the place.

42:50.669 --> 42:51.968
- Ragwater Falls?

42:53.672 --> 42:54.671
- Yeah, okay.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.640
Yeah, you tell me where
it is and we'll go.

42:57.642 --> 42:59.142
- I don't know.

42:59.144 --> 43:00.677
It was just some place
Rey was talkin' about but,

43:00.679 --> 43:02.011
maybe California or Colorado

43:02.013 --> 43:05.181
but it's like rafting
and fishing and stuff.

43:05.183 --> 43:06.015
- That's sounds great.

43:06.017 --> 43:07.183
Go pack your bag.

43:07.185 --> 43:08.585
- Aren't we supposed
to call first?

43:10.021 --> 43:11.287
- Right.

43:11.289 --> 43:14.924
Um, yeah we, we'll call
your P.O. from the road.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.092
- Mom.

43:16.094 --> 43:17.627
- Please don't
argue with me okay?

43:17.629 --> 43:19.963
- I don't wanna get in trouble.

43:19.965 --> 43:20.930
Just call 'em.

43:22.133 --> 43:24.100
- All right, I'll call.

43:27.706 --> 43:29.906
I'll give 'em a call.

43:29.908 --> 43:34.243
(gentle music)

43:46.024 --> 43:48.224
- I'll be in the
shop if you need me.

43:48.226 --> 43:50.893
(gentle music)

43:56.201 --> 43:58.334
- There's a customer here.

43:58.336 --> 44:00.770
Says she wants to see you.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.150
- Can I help you?

44:14.152 --> 44:15.985
- My name's Dani Wilson.

44:15.986 --> 44:17.819
I think you worked with
my boyfriend Daryl Cobb?

44:17.822 --> 44:20.223
(pensive music)

44:20.225 --> 44:22.992
- Yeah, I'm sorry I think
you got the wrong person.

44:22.994 --> 44:24.160
- I ain't here to cause trouble.

44:24.162 --> 44:25.828
- Like I said I
don't know anything--

44:25.830 --> 44:27.196
- But I will if I have to.

44:31.436 --> 44:33.770
Look, I ain't no snitch.

44:33.772 --> 44:36.773
I don't give a shit
about stolen cars.

44:36.775 --> 44:38.841
- I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

44:38.843 --> 44:40.443
- Daryl turned up
dead yesterday.

44:41.780 --> 44:43.112
I just need to know why.

44:43.915 --> 44:45.381
- I'm really sorry to hear that.

44:47.152 --> 44:48.718
(Dani sighs)

44:48.720 --> 44:50.153
You talk to the police?

44:50.155 --> 44:51.854
- The police don't give a shit.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.289
He's just some junkie to them.

44:53.291 --> 44:54.223
Did he ever talk about anybody

44:54.225 --> 44:56.259
who could have been angry at him

44:56.261 --> 44:59.328
or maybe somebody's car he'd
stolen that had found him?

44:59.330 --> 45:00.296
- Sorry.

45:03.234 --> 45:06.202
Look, I don't want
any trouble all right?

45:06.204 --> 45:07.437
Cars are my ex's thing.

45:09.007 --> 45:11.374
I wish I could help you, I
just, I don't know anything

45:11.376 --> 45:13.342
about what happened
to your boyfriend.

45:14.746 --> 45:16.245
- [Dani] Did he ever
talk about anybody

45:16.247 --> 45:20.349
that he might have
worked with or...

45:20.351 --> 45:21.718
- No, I'm sorry.

45:24.322 --> 45:27.290
If anything comes to
mind I'll let you know.

45:28.359 --> 45:31.294
(ominous music)

45:35.967 --> 45:41.037
(Leigh gasps)

45:44.509 --> 45:47.243
- Well, thank you for your time.

45:54.052 --> 45:54.951
Oh my God.

45:56.387 --> 45:58.221
- It's not what you think.

45:58.223 --> 45:59.422
- Oh my God.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.392
You get out of my way.

46:06.498 --> 46:08.264
- I can't do that.

46:12.203 --> 46:13.302
- [Ryan] Mom?

46:14.405 --> 46:17.874
- Ryan, just get
back to work buddy.

46:18.777 --> 46:20.076
- Is everything okay?

46:20.078 --> 46:21.010
- It's fine.

46:21.012 --> 46:23.412
Just go on out back with Rey.

46:37.295 --> 46:42.365
I swear to God, it
was an accident.

46:42.967 --> 46:45.301
He,

46:45.303 --> 46:46.836
he attacked me.

46:59.250 --> 47:01.918
(door slams)

47:22.507 --> 47:23.406
- Leigh?

47:32.483 --> 47:34.417
- I'm in trouble Rey.

47:36.554 --> 47:39.422
(Leigh sniffling)

47:47.932 --> 47:50.433
- [Rey] Let's get outta here.

47:53.938 --> 47:59.008
(engine rumbling)

48:31.409 --> 48:33.342
- [Ryan] You comin'?

48:35.013 --> 48:36.078
- Ryan, I...

48:41.119 --> 48:42.184
If you um...

48:48.293 --> 48:50.092
If you ever need your papers,

48:50.094 --> 48:54.063
your birth certificate
or anything,

48:54.065 --> 48:56.599
there's a shoe box in my closet.

48:59.637 --> 49:00.569
- Okay.

49:04.509 --> 49:06.108
- Just--
- [Rey] Hey.

49:06.110 --> 49:07.376
[Rey] Foods gettin' cold.

49:07.378 --> 49:10.246
(somber music)

49:14.118 --> 49:15.384
- You hungry?

49:17.221 --> 49:18.354
I'm starvin'.

49:20.224 --> 49:22.124
(door slams)

49:22.126 --> 49:23.359
- [Rey] All right, come on.

49:23.361 --> 49:25.194
I need your answer.

49:27.231 --> 49:28.597
- The wrist pin?

49:28.599 --> 49:30.166
- Nope.

49:30.168 --> 49:33.536
Wrist pin holds the piston
to the connecting rod.

49:34.339 --> 49:37.273
That's oh for three.

49:37.275 --> 49:39.208
Guess who's got
broom duty tomorrow?

49:39.210 --> 49:40.977
- Mom's the one
who made the mess.

49:41.579 --> 49:42.478
- Excuse me?

49:42.480 --> 49:45.314
- [Rey] I used to
make stupid bets like

49:45.316 --> 49:47.216
that with your dad all the time.

49:48.052 --> 49:49.018
You remember that?

49:50.021 --> 49:51.253
- Oh yeah.

49:51.255 --> 49:54.323
I remember you used
to lose all the time.

49:57.195 --> 49:58.394
- Did you like him?

50:01.299 --> 50:02.198
My dad?

50:05.636 --> 50:10.606
- Your dad was a,
complicated guy.

50:10.608 --> 50:12.308
He was really hard to know.

50:13.578 --> 50:17.046
But hey, he made the
world's greatest kid.

50:21.386 --> 50:23.219
- Al right buddy, it's bed time.

50:23.221 --> 50:24.320
- Come on.

50:25.490 --> 50:27.289
- Say goodnight.

50:27.291 --> 50:28.491
- Goodnight.

50:28.493 --> 50:30.259
- [Rey] Goodnight.

50:52.250 --> 50:53.416
How bad is it?

50:55.219 --> 50:56.485
- You don't wanna know.

50:56.487 --> 50:59.055
- Probably not but
I don't see anybody

50:59.057 --> 51:00.790
else lining up trying to help.

51:02.627 --> 51:04.193
- I fucked up, Rey.

51:06.230 --> 51:10.332
I didn't stop running cars
after Jesse got put away.

51:10.334 --> 51:11.851
- Jesus.

51:11.852 --> 51:13.369
- Hey, it was the only
thing keepin' us afloat.

51:13.371 --> 51:14.570
You know how things are.

51:14.572 --> 51:17.239
I had to think about
Ryan, about you.

51:17.241 --> 51:18.474
- Don't put that on me.

51:19.343 --> 51:20.843
- I didn't mean it like that.

51:22.346 --> 51:25.414
- There wasn't a
break in was there?

51:34.559 --> 51:36.492
- I had a fight
with Jesse's guy.

51:37.395 --> 51:39.495
I swapped the VIN
numbers on a truck.

51:39.497 --> 51:41.664
He was supposed to
bring me the money

51:41.666 --> 51:43.432
but his buyer fell through.

51:43.434 --> 51:45.868
So he said he wasn't gonna pay
me till he found another one.

51:47.405 --> 51:52.108
I told him that wasn't the
deal, I'd already done the work.

51:57.281 --> 51:58.514
I lost my temper.

52:00.451 --> 52:01.484
I threw a wrench.

52:04.455 --> 52:05.354
We,

52:07.258 --> 52:08.224
we had a fight.

52:10.361 --> 52:12.261
It was an accident.

52:15.299 --> 52:17.266
- What was an accident?

52:17.268 --> 52:21.904
(Leigh gasping)

52:21.906 --> 52:24.140
Oh, Jesus, Leigh.

52:26.310 --> 52:28.544
Why didn't you call the cops?

52:29.380 --> 52:30.446
- And tell 'em what?

52:31.582 --> 52:32.481
Huh?

52:36.888 --> 52:38.254
His girlfriend knows.

52:39.624 --> 52:42.358
- [Rey] The woman from the shop?

52:49.734 --> 52:51.700
- I keep thinking I hear sirens.

52:52.870 --> 52:53.936
Is that weird?

52:58.242 --> 52:58.908
- Does Ryan know?

53:01.913 --> 53:03.679
- He deserves better, Rey.

53:05.416 --> 53:08.684
A dad in jail, a mom on
the way, a grandfather...

53:12.190 --> 53:14.623
Might as well lock
him up myself.

53:17.195 --> 53:18.260
- He's a good kid.

53:19.964 --> 53:21.263
He'll be okay.

53:24.969 --> 53:27.303
- What do they even do,

53:31.442 --> 53:33.909
if a kid's got no parents?

53:33.911 --> 53:37.246
- He's always welcome
with me, you know that.

53:37.248 --> 53:38.214
- I couldn't ask you that.

53:38.216 --> 53:39.882
- And you're not gonna have to.

53:44.488 --> 53:46.388
We're gonna get this
thing figured out.

53:46.390 --> 53:51.460
(gentle music)

54:22.960 --> 54:28.030
(thunder rumbling)

54:34.472 --> 54:37.306
(rain pattering)

54:41.412 --> 54:42.778
(door shutting)

54:42.780 --> 54:47.850
(pensive music)

54:51.956 --> 54:57.026
(men whispering)

55:02.433 --> 55:03.899
- [Richard] Your service weapon?

55:03.901 --> 55:06.702
You shot the man with
your service weapon?

55:09.774 --> 55:10.690
- [Man] Shit.

55:10.691 --> 55:11.607
- [Richard] Report it stolen.

55:11.609 --> 55:13.809
Dump it somewhere.

55:13.811 --> 55:15.944
- [Man] Won't that
seem suspicious?

55:15.946 --> 55:19.682
- [Richard] You think
you got a better idea?

55:20.951 --> 55:21.850
God damn it!

55:22.953 --> 55:25.087
- [Man] What was
I supposed to do?

55:25.089 --> 55:28.657
- [Richard] Shake him
down, not shoot him.

55:30.561 --> 55:32.428
Help me move him.

55:41.105 --> 55:43.772
(body thuds)

55:48.379 --> 55:50.045
- [Man] You think
your girl heard?

55:50.047 --> 55:52.014
What if she says somethin'?

55:53.351 --> 55:55.017
- [Richard] She's a good girl.

55:55.019 --> 55:57.453
She'll do what she's told.

56:18.142 --> 56:23.412
(door creaking)

56:26.717 --> 56:27.950
(Travis yells)

56:27.952 --> 56:32.654
(Travis groaning)
(Leigh groaning)

56:55.746 --> 56:57.179
- It was you that
killed my daddy?

56:57.181 --> 56:58.647
- Please!

56:58.649 --> 56:59.882
Please (groans)!

56:59.884 --> 57:01.750
- You scream, I
kill your son too.

57:02.586 --> 57:05.421
- You don't have to do this.

57:05.423 --> 57:07.656
(Leigh choking)

57:07.658 --> 57:08.924
- Shut up!

57:08.926 --> 57:13.562
(Leigh screaming)
(Travis groaning)

57:15.032 --> 57:17.800
(Leigh wheezing)

57:17.802 --> 57:18.700
- Rey!

57:19.670 --> 57:20.502
It's her son.

57:20.504 --> 57:23.772
(Leigh gasping)

57:23.774 --> 57:26.208
(gun loading)

57:26.210 --> 57:27.443
Ryan, no.

57:27.445 --> 57:28.076
- Whoa, whoa buddy.

57:28.078 --> 57:29.178
It's okay.

57:30.481 --> 57:31.180
Leigh.

57:33.017 --> 57:33.916
- Buddy?

57:35.219 --> 57:36.952
Hey, give it to me.

57:36.954 --> 57:37.853
Ryan?

57:40.758 --> 57:41.723
It's okay.

57:41.725 --> 57:42.558
It's okay.

57:42.560 --> 57:43.725
Hey, hey.

57:43.727 --> 57:44.726
We're okay.

57:51.202 --> 57:52.701
- Hey buddy, hey?

57:54.805 --> 57:57.239
You got any duct
tape around, huh?

57:59.143 --> 58:00.242
- Yeah?

58:00.244 --> 58:01.577
- Okay, can you
go get it for me?

58:02.746 --> 58:03.579
- Yeah.

58:03.581 --> 58:04.213
- [Rey] All right.

58:04.215 --> 58:05.714
- [Leigh] Yeah.

58:12.189 --> 58:14.623
- You gotta call the cops.

58:21.198 --> 58:22.097
- I know.

58:36.146 --> 58:41.216
(thunder rumbling)
(crickets chirping)

58:42.253 --> 58:43.252
You okay?

58:46.090 --> 58:46.922
Hey buddy, come on.

58:46.924 --> 58:47.956
Let's go inside.

58:48.859 --> 58:50.759
It's startin' to rain.

59:00.638 --> 59:02.571
Look, I'm really
sorry about all this.

59:04.942 --> 59:06.208
- He didn't get away did he?

59:10.681 --> 59:12.581
The man at the garage?

59:14.685 --> 59:16.919
It was me that
killed him wasn't it?

59:16.921 --> 59:18.720
- No, Ryan.

59:18.722 --> 59:20.155
- Stop lyin' to me.

59:24.028 --> 59:26.128
I felt it break in his head.

59:26.130 --> 59:27.930
- That is not the
way it happened.

59:27.932 --> 59:28.964
- Yes it is.
- No.

59:28.966 --> 59:30.098
There was a fight.

59:30.100 --> 59:31.300
That man attacked me.

59:31.302 --> 59:32.935
- No.
- I hit him, he went down.

59:32.937 --> 59:34.036
You weren't anywhere around.

59:34.038 --> 59:35.104
- That's not the truth.

59:35.105 --> 59:36.171
- I don't care
what the truth is.

59:37.875 --> 59:39.174
This is the truth now.

59:40.010 --> 59:41.109
You understand?

59:44.882 --> 59:45.781
Look.

59:47.017 --> 59:49.685
I made some really
shitty decisions.

59:50.788 --> 59:53.088
That's why we're in the
situation we're in right now.

59:54.692 --> 59:55.891
- I killed that kid's dad.

59:58.028 --> 59:59.094
- He attacked me.

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:01.797
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:03.765
- Then why is it a secret?

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:08.670
- 'Cause it's just
simpler that way.

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:13.976
- It's because of
the trouble I got in.

01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:19.314
You're scared I'm like dad.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:22.084
- Ryan, you are nothin'
like your father.

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:23.652
- Well then who am I like?

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:25.854
You?

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:32.894
(Ryan scoffs)

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.146
(Leigh sighs)

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:57.953
- [Rey] He's a lot
stronger than you think.

01:00:57.955 --> 01:01:00.222
- [Travis] Fuck you, you
stupid fuckin' bitch.

01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:01.023
(Travis groaning)

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:02.824
- Hey, hey, no, no!

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:03.759
- [Travis] Get off me!

01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:04.326
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.861
No, no, no, no.

01:01:05.863 --> 01:01:07.996
(Travis mumbling)

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.932
Look, it's not gonna help, okay?

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.875
We'll get a lawyer and we'll
get this thing figured out.

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:21.710
- Yeah.

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:23.145
(Knocking)

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:24.046
- Okay.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:27.315
Just don't tell 'em
that the kid broke in.

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:28.216
That's it.

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:30.285
Okay?

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:31.119
(Knocking)

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:32.888
- [Richard] Leigh?

01:01:40.764 --> 01:01:43.432
- You didn't call the cops?

01:01:43.434 --> 01:01:45.267
- I just need some advice first.

01:01:45.269 --> 01:01:48.837
- You know damn well the kind
of advice he's gonna give you.

01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:52.441
(gentle music)

01:01:52.443 --> 01:01:55.010
- You should get outta here.

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:58.747
- [Richard] Leigh open up.

01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:12.828
(door latches)

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:17.899
(Leigh sniffles)

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:26.374
You all right?

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:27.375
- I'm okay.

01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:28.844
- Ryan?

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:29.478
- [Leigh] He's fine.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.213
He's in his bedroom.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.399
- You fucked up, kid.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:00.108
How'd he find you?

01:03:02.246 --> 01:03:04.513
- His mom must've told him.

01:03:04.515 --> 01:03:06.014
- How'd she find you?

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:10.485
- [Leigh] I lost my necklace
when I was droppin' him off.

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:11.887
She must've found it.

01:03:14.925 --> 01:03:17.392
- You didn't think that
was worth tellin' me?

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:19.895
- I didn't expect
it to get this far.

01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:22.297
- It has.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.466
- What am I lookin' at?

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:28.069
If I turn myself in?

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:30.205
- That depends.

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:34.409
You really stop runnin' cars
after Jesse got sent up?

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:38.113
Right.

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:41.016
Felony murder.

01:03:41.018 --> 01:03:42.150
- It was self defense.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.385
- It doesn't matter.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:45.153
Stealin' cars--
- Swapping tags.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.421
- Is a felony.

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:48.857
And the piece of shit was killed

01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:50.292
in the commission of the crime.

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:51.259
- All right, okay.

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:54.362
All right.

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:55.497
There's gotta be another way.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:57.432
- I think you know there is.

01:03:57.434 --> 01:03:59.134
- I can, I'll talk to her.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.503
I can explain that...

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:06.107
God damn it.

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:07.209
- Look at me.

01:04:08.579 --> 01:04:10.545
I checked down at
the department.

01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:12.347
They ain't got
shit for evidence,

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.216
and they ain't lookin' for any,

01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:16.885
but if you're tellin' me
that this woman and her boy,

01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:18.086
they know somethin' about
you, they got proof--

01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:19.621
- No, no, no.

01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:21.456
No, I am not like you.

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:23.158
I don't have that in me.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.595
- So you said your whole
damn life but here we are.

01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:33.435
Livin' with somethin' like
this is a son of a bitch,

01:04:33.437 --> 01:04:35.170
but it's livin'.

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:46.047
- I don't want the
kid here anymore.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.282
Take him to the shop.

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:50.151
- Okay.

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:52.053
Then what?

01:04:58.362 --> 01:05:02.097
- I don't know (sniffles).

01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:05.634
Don't, don't do anything
until I get there.

01:05:05.636 --> 01:05:07.135
- What about the girl?

01:05:07.137 --> 01:05:11.039
(Leigh gasping)

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.107
- I'll figure somethin' out.

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:17.178
(Knocking)

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:31.026
I came to see if you
could watch Ryan?

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:35.096
- You must think of me
as a real asshole, huh?

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:36.431
- That is not--
- Don't.

01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:40.435
You want him to find
a different way?

01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:42.671
Show it to him.

01:05:42.673 --> 01:05:44.306
- Why didn't you call the cops?

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:49.177
- Because I knew that
you wouldn't hurt him.

01:05:50.247 --> 01:05:52.147
- Maybe I already did.

01:05:56.153 --> 01:05:57.552
- [Rey] Did you?

01:06:02.225 --> 01:06:03.325
- Please Rey.

01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:07.729
I'm not askin' for me.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:25.613
Hey, did you um,

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:31.519
did you tell Ryan about some
raftin' or fishin' place?

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:34.222
Colorado maybe?

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:36.524
- Yeah.

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:39.327
- I think it caught
his imagination.

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:44.165
Might be nice to
take him sometime.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:49.237
(gentle music)

01:06:57.047 --> 01:06:58.346
- What's gonna happen to him?

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:05.453
- Your grandfather's
gonna take him to jail.

01:07:08.759 --> 01:07:11.259
- What if I told
them it was my fault?

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:13.495
Would he still have to go?

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:25.073
- Some things just
can't be undone.

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:33.415
Hey?

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:34.415
You've got so much good in you.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:37.619
- I'm sorry,

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:41.823
about what I said.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.193
About not bein' like you.
- No, no.

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:46.561
- I didn't--
- Hey.

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:57.372
(Leigh sniffling)

01:07:57.374 --> 01:07:59.207
All right.

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:01.309
I'll see ya in the morning.

01:08:15.392 --> 01:08:20.462
(pensive music)

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:50.191
(fan whirring)

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:44.606
(Dani gasps)

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:46.674
You send him to kill me?

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:47.675
- What?

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:48.943
- Your boy?

01:10:48.945 --> 01:10:50.945
You send him for revenge.

01:10:50.947 --> 01:10:51.779
- Where is he?

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:52.747
Where's my son?

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:55.383
- He broke in and attacked me.

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:56.451
- Is he...

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:59.554
- He's fine, for now.

01:11:01.358 --> 01:11:02.357
- Oh God.

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:03.891
- Are you sayin'
you didn't know?

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:07.562
- It ain't like he
didn't have good reason.

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:12.567
- Why haven't you
called the cops yet?

01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:17.572
- Did Cobb really attack you
the night you killed him?

01:11:18.908 --> 01:11:19.941
- Mm hm.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.509
- Sounds like him.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:26.848
You here to kill me now too?

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:32.854
You don't seem like the type.

01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:33.955
- That's enough.

01:11:36.493 --> 01:11:38.293
- Tryin' to protect someone?

01:11:40.063 --> 01:11:40.895
Is it the Mexican?

01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:42.597
- I said that's enough.

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:43.431
- Fuck.

01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:47.402
(pensive music)

01:11:47.404 --> 01:11:51.739
Easy momma bear, we both got
cubs we're worried about.

01:11:55.912 --> 01:11:56.911
- Pack your bags.

01:11:57.847 --> 01:11:59.347
- What?

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:00.548
- For both of you.

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:01.683
You got two minutes.

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:04.619
We're gonna go get your boy,
you're gonna get in your car

01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:05.586
and you're gonna get outta here.

01:12:05.588 --> 01:12:07.739
- Where are we supposed to go?

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.891
- North, south, east,
west, I don't give a shit!

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:15.330
But you are gonna stay the
fuck away from me and my son.

01:12:15.332 --> 01:12:17.598
(pensive music)

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.670
(tires on gravel)

01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:29.711
Hey?

01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:30.778
- Yeah?

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.947
- [Leigh] It's me,
we're comin' in.

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:34.682
- Oh Jesus.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.884
- All right, that's far enough.

01:12:39.622 --> 01:12:40.455
Good girl.

01:12:40.457 --> 01:12:42.924
(pensive music)

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:46.894
What are you doin'?

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:48.096
- These two are gonna
get in their car.

01:12:48.098 --> 01:12:49.530
They're leavin' town.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.466
- Leigh.

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:53.735
You've lost your nerve.

01:12:53.737 --> 01:12:54.635
- Don't touch me.

01:12:57.941 --> 01:13:00.541
- What do you think is
gonna happen, Leigh?

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:01.776
You think they're
gonna just walk

01:13:01.778 --> 01:13:03.911
out of here and
forget everything?

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:06.547
- That's exactly what
they're gonna do.

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:07.882
- And what if they don't?

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:10.918
What happens when
that bitch and her pup

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.687
are 20, 30 miles down the road

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:14.655
and you don't have
that gun on 'em?

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:17.024
You're gonna be livin' with what

01:13:17.026 --> 01:13:19.861
you do right now
for a long time.

01:13:20.797 --> 01:13:21.963
- They don't deserve this.

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:25.700
- Nobody said they did.

01:13:34.043 --> 01:13:35.977
- I'm not killin'
anyone tonight.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.913
- Jesus Christ.

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:42.016
- No!

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:43.618
- No, don't!

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.652
- Get outta the way.

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:45.553
- No.

01:13:55.899 --> 01:13:57.565
(shot firing)
(object clattering)

01:13:57.567 --> 01:13:59.700
(Travis groaning)

01:13:59.702 --> 01:14:01.736
- Can't guard both of 'em girl.

01:14:01.738 --> 01:14:02.570
Come on.

01:14:02.572 --> 01:14:04.739
Let's finish it now.

01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:05.973
(gun cocking)

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:07.942
- [Leigh] Put it down.

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:13.014
(shots firing)

01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:19.487
- Everything that I've ever
done was to protect you.

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:21.956
- Bullshit.

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:25.860
I've kept your
secrets my whole life.

01:14:32.168 --> 01:14:34.569
A kid should never be
asked such a thing.

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:38.172
- Leigh!
- No, Travis!

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:40.908
(shots firing)

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:42.076
- Leigh!
- No!

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:44.212
No!

01:14:44.214 --> 01:14:47.882
(Dani groaning)
(Richard groaning)

01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:51.018
(objects clattering)

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:58.025
(Dani screams)
(tense music)

01:14:58.027 --> 01:15:00.978
- No!

01:15:00.979 --> 01:15:03.930
(Dani gasping)
(Richard groaning)

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:07.935
- [Dani] Travis, run!

01:15:14.043 --> 01:15:17.178
(shot firing)
(Leigh gasping)

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:22.250
(Dani gasping)

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:37.732
- You killed him.

01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:42.136
- [Dani] That wasn't my plan.

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:47.041
Oh God.

01:15:48.177 --> 01:15:49.310
Was he a cop?

01:15:56.286 --> 01:15:57.635
- Yeah.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:58.985
- [Dani] Oh shit, shit, shit.

01:16:04.627 --> 01:16:06.694
- I didn't tell my
dad to hurt your boy.

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:10.231
- I didn't send
Travis to kill you.

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:15.736
- We gonna just kill
each other anyway.

01:16:19.309 --> 01:16:21.576
- There's somethin'
that I need to know.

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:26.030
Why did you bring him to me?

01:16:26.031 --> 01:16:28.148
Why didn't you just bury
him in the fuckin' woods?

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:32.320
- Does it matter?

01:16:32.322 --> 01:16:37.592
(Dani sniffling)

01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:41.662
You needed to know.

01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:46.734
(Dani sobbing)

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:07.154
It doesn't have
to end like this.

01:17:09.092 --> 01:17:10.291
We can both walk away.

01:17:11.327 --> 01:17:12.393
- Then what?

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:15.162
- I don't know.

01:17:16.165 --> 01:17:17.131
I don't care.

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:23.337
I just wanna go home.

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:28.409
(Dani sobbing)

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:39.020
(Leigh exhaling)

01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:51.999
I'm comin' out now.

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:53.401
- Don't you fuckin' move.

01:17:53.403 --> 01:17:54.301
- Easy.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:01.942
I'm just gettin' your keys.

01:18:04.047 --> 01:18:09.116
(keys jingling)

01:18:29.272 --> 01:18:31.872
I'm puttin' my gun down now.

01:18:45.822 --> 01:18:48.389
- You're a good person, Leigh.

01:18:51.194 --> 01:18:53.194
(shot firing)

01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:58.265
(pensive music)
(Leigh gasping)

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:04.138
(Dani sobbing)

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:08.309
(shot firing)

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:13.380
(Leigh gasping)

01:19:21.124 --> 01:19:21.956
Your old man was right.

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:23.257
It was never gonna end.

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:28.329
(Leigh gasping)

01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:32.800
But your boy is safe,
you have my word.

01:19:34.403 --> 01:19:37.905
I owe you that for lettin'
me bury him proper.

01:19:37.907 --> 01:19:42.443
(Leigh gasping)

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:45.946
(Leigh unintelligible)

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:54.054
(Leigh unintelligible)

01:19:54.056 --> 01:19:56.490
(somber music)

01:20:04.267 --> 01:20:07.067
You're gonna get
blood on your shoes.

01:20:07.069 --> 01:20:09.937
(somber music)

01:20:31.227 --> 01:20:33.828
