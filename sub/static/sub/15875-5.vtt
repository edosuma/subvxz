00:02.669 --> 00:04.471
ANNOUNCER: How are
you and TJ, Maddie?

00:04.471 --> 00:06.406
I come home and I feel
like I barely exist.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.041
Maybe you need
something like this.

00:08.041 --> 00:08.909
Why are you wearing that?

00:08.909 --> 00:09.776
Is there something wrong?

00:09.776 --> 00:12.246
It feels like TJ
could care less.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.347
I wanted to come
up here and ask

00:13.347 --> 00:14.648
for your blessing to marry Eva.

00:14.648 --> 00:15.916
You know what, no.

00:15.916 --> 00:16.950
Flat no.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.185
This is my number one priority.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.786
I'm not going to listen
to you guys over her.

00:19.786 --> 00:23.090
You disrespected me, you
disrespected the family.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.391
I love this man.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.360
I want to spend the rest
of my life with him.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.362
If my family can't accept
that, then that's on them.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.203
Hey.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.170
Natter.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.639
My first time in here.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.140
Yeah.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.676
Try not to break the seat.

00:42.676 --> 00:45.345
I came home today, and I
watched TV for five seconds

00:45.345 --> 00:46.813
and fell asleep.

00:46.813 --> 00:49.016
I just feel like I haven't
been giving TJ enough, like,

00:49.016 --> 00:50.684
attention, but I just
haven't had time.

00:50.684 --> 00:51.485
I feel like that too.

00:51.485 --> 00:54.521
You and I actually are in
like a very similar situation.

00:54.521 --> 00:55.789
You've been with
John for awhile.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.758
I've been with TJ for
well over a decade.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.092
How long have you
guys been engaged for?

00:59.092 --> 00:59.893
Two years now.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.528
Going on two years.

01:01.528 --> 01:03.697
Has it really been that long?

01:03.697 --> 01:04.598
Yes.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.033
Oh, my gosh.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.134
Isn't that horrible?

01:07.134 --> 01:08.235
Oh, god.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.671
John and I have been
together going on five years.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.439
We've never set a
date for our wedding

01:12.439 --> 01:14.942
because our schedules
are so busy.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.076
-Hi!
-What's up?

01:16.076 --> 01:16.877
How you doing?

01:16.877 --> 01:17.678
I miss you.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.513
We were just talking about you.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.782
Good shot, girl.

01:21.782 --> 01:22.649
Bam!

01:22.649 --> 01:23.450
Oh!

01:23.450 --> 01:26.887
Koren, I might just--
I might just steal John.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.255
Hey, let me do something.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.556
If I make this ball in--

01:29.556 --> 01:31.091
If you make this ball
in, you have to get

01:31.091 --> 01:32.526
married in the next six months.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.393
I'm down with that.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.062
Nattie!

stomach is killing me.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.615
You're really swollen.
I'm not trying to freak you out.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.782
I have no idea.
It's not like--

01:55.782 --> 01:56.049
It's not normal.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.517
I've never seen
it like this ever.

01:57.517 --> 01:58.352
I know.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.887
We really need to get you
to the doctor like ASAP

02:00.887 --> 02:03.557
EVA MARIE: Last night,
I was in horrible pain,

02:03.557 --> 02:05.993
and I have no idea
what's going on.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.127
I feel like I'm dying.

02:07.127 --> 02:11.531
Like, I woke up this morning,
and my stomach was so huge.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.567
It looked like I was pregnant.

02:13.567 --> 02:17.204
My stomach legit feels
like a [BEEP] balloon.

02:17.204 --> 02:18.705
Peing blood is gigantic.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.674
We need to figure
out what it is.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.110
EVA MARIE: What if I have,
like, something ruptured.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.345
I don't even want you
thinking that right now.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.347
EVA MARIE: Jonathan is
rushing me to the emergency.

02:27.347 --> 02:30.283
I'm in so much pain,
and I have no idea why.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.985
I look at my stomach,
and it's deformed.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.322

Ooh, look at those pants.

02:54.307 --> 02:55.242
Bet you better work.

02:55.242 --> 02:56.043
I'm calling her shoes.

I love it.

02:56.843 --> 02:57.644
You're spoiled.

02:57.644 --> 02:58.779
I love that.

I love it.

Really?

03:02.949 --> 03:05.652
We had a lot of
making up to do.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.788
So how was last night with TJ?

03:07.788 --> 03:09.056
Just--

03:09.056 --> 03:11.091
She doesn't know
what doggie-style is.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.292
Shut up.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.994
First of all, I--

03:13.994 --> 03:16.663
You didn't ask
me what doggie is.

03:16.663 --> 03:21.435
[LAUGHTER]

03:21.435 --> 03:23.136
Nattie needs to get
outside of her box.

03:23.136 --> 03:23.904
She needs to let loose.

03:23.904 --> 03:24.705
She needs get free.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.440
She needs get crazy.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.575
Nattie, show me.

03:28.575 --> 03:29.643
Excuse me, Sir.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.178
Maybe we can have him show us.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.313
[NATTIE]: Nicole!

03:33.313 --> 03:34.448
Whoa, Brie.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.248
What?

03:35.248 --> 03:36.516
Brie, Nattie did
know doggie-style.

03:36.516 --> 03:37.484
No, Brie.
I did.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.052
Brie, show her.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.320
Go.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.788
Oh my God Brie, there's
people behind you.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.724
Gosh, you're in a little dress.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.624
Well, you told me.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.193
I didn't know you were
really going to do it.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.494
Oh my gosh.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.361
I may be conservative.

03:48.361 --> 03:52.165
But I may be your average
little vanilla latte.

03:52.165 --> 03:56.269
But I would rather be a vanilla
latte than a frappuccino

03:56.269 --> 03:59.072
with all fixings,
spilling my guts

03:59.072 --> 04:01.308
and making a complete
jackass of myself.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.409
Brian, come here.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.977
Nattie didn't know
what doggie-style was.

04:03.977 --> 04:04.978
Really?

04:04.978 --> 04:05.779
Yeah.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.714
I knew it as a child because
I saw my dogs have sex.

04:07.714 --> 04:08.749
OK.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.450
And I needed to figure
out how they were stuck.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.351
They were literally
stuck for an hour.

04:11.351 --> 04:11.985
Remember?
-Wait.

04:11.985 --> 04:12.919
What?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.821
Our dogs had sex one
time, and they were stuck

04:14.821 --> 04:15.856
together for like an hour.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.190
OK.

04:17.190 --> 04:22.295
Are you saying to me
dog semen is like glue?

04:22.295 --> 04:23.296
Yeah.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.042
Wouldn't you want to
do this all the time?

04:36.042 --> 04:36.843
Yeah.

04:36.843 --> 04:39.813
And kiss me every single day?

04:39.813 --> 04:42.048
Of course, Baby.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.550
That's not a problem.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.853
We've been shaking up
for four years now.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.356
Now it's time to
change the game up.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.224
John and I are
finally going to do it.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.393
We're going to take off
three days from work.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.961
We're going to fly to Hawaii.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.363
Babe, I'm ready.
I'm ready.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.130
For real?
For real.

04:57.130 --> 04:57.697
-Yes.
-For real.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.066
It was hard enough us
getting these days off,

05:00.066 --> 05:03.570
but it would've been even harder
to try to get all the girls off

05:03.570 --> 05:04.671
and to the wedding.

05:04.671 --> 05:08.675
So we decided to just have a
small but beautiful wedding.

05:08.675 --> 05:12.345
I'm thinking Mom,
Dad, Candy, Uncle Buck,

05:12.345 --> 05:14.948
my brother, my other brother.

05:14.948 --> 05:15.749
How about you?

05:15.749 --> 05:16.883
Just my brothers.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.351
My brothers and my mom.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.319
--OK.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.054
How about your dad?

05:21.054 --> 05:26.059
Umm-- No, we're not
down on the same page.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.094
And it's always been like that.

05:28.094 --> 05:29.529
Rikishi is John's dad.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.398
He's a huge name in the WWE.

05:37.904 --> 05:41.007
I'm not sure what Jon's
relationship is with his dad.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.276
I know they haven't
spoken much, but we

05:43.276 --> 05:45.545
will see him Old School
Raw, which is a night

05:45.545 --> 05:47.180
when all the legends return.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.150
And I think it'll be the perfect
opportunity for us to talk

05:50.150 --> 05:52.285
to him about the wedding.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.622
I'll feel better if you go up
to your dad and say, "Hey, Dad.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.690
I'm getting married.

to my wedding and be there.

shooting pains.

stops me in my tracks.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.429
Like I missed my
flight this morning

06:36.429 --> 06:40.100
because I realized that I
like had-- was peeing blood.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.601
So you had bright red blood?

06:41.601 --> 06:42.802
Or was it blood tinged?

06:42.802 --> 06:43.603

be developing an ovarian cyst.

pelvic sonogram right away.

-OK.

to prove myself.

Yeah, there was a cyst and
it looks like it ruptured.

07:26.646 --> 07:29.215
The doctor said that I
have a cyst on my ovaries.

07:29.215 --> 07:33.486
And what caused my stomach
to distend was that it burst,

07:33.486 --> 07:35.121
and I have all this fluid.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.324
The treatment is
I basically have

07:37.324 --> 07:41.094
to stay bedridden and let
my body absorb all the fluid

07:41.094 --> 07:42.729

like a regular cavity.

Either most uteruses
look like a pear.

we call it a bicornuate.

have a miss-shaped uterus.

to be performed,

18:27.473 --> 18:30.643
That's-- that is a lot
information right now.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.444
That really is.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.378
Like, and it's heavy.

18:32.378 --> 18:35.214
And I'm not really quite sure,
like, how to process it all.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.649
But the one thing that
I want you to know

18:36.649 --> 18:39.018
is that me and you are good.

18:39.018 --> 18:41.821
Like, with the kid
situation, that's heavy.

18:41.821 --> 18:42.622
It really is.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.423
But that's not today.

18:44.423 --> 18:45.291
Today is this.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.827
Today is what's going
on in you, right now.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.629
When it comes down to
the time to have kids,

18:49.629 --> 18:52.398
I want to go to a
specialist about that

18:52.398 --> 18:55.768
and make sure that we
have all the information.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.471
Or see what the other
options are later on.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.407
You're going to be OK.

19:01.407 --> 19:02.775
I love you like crazy.

19:02.775 --> 19:03.576
I love you.

19:07.346 --> 19:08.414
I'm just super overwhelmed.

19:08.414 --> 19:09.215
I'm a bit--

19:09.215 --> 19:11.684
Yeah, so you need to be worried
about you right now, not me.

19:11.684 --> 19:15.721
Have you told your mom
this thing about the kids?

19:15.721 --> 19:17.623
Mm-mm.

19:17.623 --> 19:19.759
Usually in this
situation, my family would

19:19.759 --> 19:21.327
be right there by my side.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.396
But I don't have that right now.

Enough is enough.

19:24.263 --> 19:25.064
Apples and oranges.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.666
You disrespected me.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.501
You disrespected the family.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.301
That's it.

19:29.301 --> 19:32.204
It's done.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.272
They disowned me.

19:33.272 --> 19:34.373
We're not on good terms.

19:34.373 --> 19:35.708
We're not even speaking.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.210
You're in a really
difficult spot.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.946
So if having your mom out
here is going to help you,

19:40.946 --> 19:43.315
then I want that to happen.

19:43.315 --> 19:44.784

Hey, Trin, are your
parents in already?

20:28.427 --> 20:30.196
My dad got in yesterday.

20:30.196 --> 20:30.996
You heard from Kish?

20:33.632 --> 20:35.701

No.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.471
Coming?

20:38.471 --> 20:41.073
Yeah, he's supposed to be.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.977
I definitely think it's
weird that Jon and his dad

20:44.977 --> 20:47.446
are not communicating
with each other.

actually eat the banana.

27:17.836 --> 27:22.975
The office is all
about rear entry.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.676
Gotcha.

27:24.676 --> 27:27.379
Here we are in the hallway.

27:27.379 --> 27:32.618
And this is where the
postman always comes twice.

27:32.618 --> 27:36.588
In this game, you
leave the door open.

27:36.588 --> 27:39.224
And you're going to get
down and do it, right

27:39.224 --> 27:40.926
here, right on this floor.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.194
With the neighbors watching.

27:42.194 --> 27:42.995
Right.

27:42.995 --> 27:43.795
Yeah.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.631
She's a little
kinky, this woman.

27:45.631 --> 27:47.799
I'm not against trying
things out of my element,

27:47.799 --> 27:50.002
but she's suggesting
that we open the door

27:50.002 --> 27:52.004
and have sex in the
middle of our dining room.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.939
Because we really want
the neighbor's kids

27:53.939 --> 27:57.209
and their disgusting gross dog
that takes poops on my lawn

27:57.209 --> 27:59.111
to see us having sex.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.946
You met when you work
very, very, very young.

28:00.946 --> 28:01.747
Right.

28:01.747 --> 28:03.382
Did you have to sneak around?

28:03.382 --> 28:04.183
Yeah.

28:04.183 --> 28:07.753
We are going to go
back to that night.

28:07.753 --> 28:10.522
The very first time
that you got together.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.558
What happened during
that first night?

28:12.558 --> 28:13.425
Um, I don't know.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.495
I think- TJ, do you
remember that night?

28:16.495 --> 28:18.931
Yeah I remember very clearly.

28:18.931 --> 28:19.765
Tell me.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.567
Everything just really
did just kind of happen.

28:21.567 --> 28:22.968
It wasn't like we
went on some date.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.103
I liked her way
before she liked me.

28:25.103 --> 28:26.805
We'd been roommates
for awhile, where,

28:26.805 --> 28:29.508
like, you'd sleep beside each
other and it wasn't a big deal,

28:29.508 --> 28:30.309
right?

28:30.309 --> 28:33.345
Then, for some reason, that
night, everything changed.

28:37.015 --> 28:41.353
Just kissing started going down
out of the blue on both ends.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.222
And did you think she was cute?

28:43.222 --> 28:44.256
Yeah, of course.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.624
Was she hot?

28:45.624 --> 28:46.491
Absolutely.

28:46.491 --> 28:48.427
Did she just make
your heart pound?

28:48.427 --> 28:50.996
Yeah.

28:50.996 --> 28:54.733
It actually kind of surprised
me that TJ is being so romantic

28:54.733 --> 28:56.201
and talking about
those special moments

28:56.201 --> 28:57.836
that I've actually forgotten.

28:57.836 --> 29:00.172
That TJ holds so
close to his heart.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.974
I have to admit
that I am turned on.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.809
Maybe talking to
Doctor Milrod is

29:03.809 --> 29:07.145
what TJ and I needed to kind of
like rejuvenate our sex life.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.147
It's definitely
given me some ideas.

29:09.147 --> 29:11.717
I think he's getting
turned on now just

29:11.717 --> 29:13.051
sitting like this with you.

29:13.051 --> 29:13.852
Yeah.

29:13.852 --> 29:14.653

This just makes me so happy.

But Jon's dad still
hasn't arrived yet.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.955

why isn't he here?

You all know what's the
deal with Pops coming?

Want to sit down?

29:56.695 --> 29:57.763
Your dad ain't here.

29:57.763 --> 29:58.664
He should be here.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.467
Like, is there something
I don't know about?

Is it because of me?

I honestly don't know why
Jon's dad isn't coming.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.765
I hope it's not because
he doesn't approve of me.

30:37.302 --> 30:38.303
Did you have an orgasm?

30:38.303 --> 30:39.171
Um--

30:39.171 --> 30:40.339
Did he hit it from
the back, girl?

TJ and I decided to
try some role playing.

The first time I came
down to the temple,

31:53.945 --> 31:55.847
and I saw you two
together, I automatically

31:55.847 --> 31:59.017
knew you loved each other then.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.737
Doctor Milrod's session was.

She was just so-- she
was, like, I want to make

your house more romantic.

the banana somewhere bad.

33:01.446 --> 33:02.247
It was just awkward.

TJ was, basically, like,
turning bright red.

And so we went and took a
whole tour of our house.

33:07.552 --> 33:08.587
I would do anything to see it.

Mm, OK.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.123
Can you eat food?
Or no?

38:45.123 --> 38:45.924
No.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.358
Can I have, actually,
a sip of that?

38:47.358 --> 38:48.493
Yeah.
It's really hot.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.228
Just be careful.

38:50.228 --> 38:52.096
[DOORBELL RING]

38:52.096 --> 38:52.997
Oh, gees.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.066
Uh-oh.

38:55.066 --> 38:55.867
World war three.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.302
You want to stay
and I'll do it?

38:57.302 --> 38:58.303
Yeah.

38:58.303 --> 39:01.339
The last time I saw my family,
they basically walked out

39:01.339 --> 39:05.610
on Jonathan and I. So I'm scared
because the last thing I need

39:05.610 --> 39:06.411
is stress.

39:06.411 --> 39:08.646
Like, I'm [BLEEP]
sick right now.

39:08.646 --> 39:09.447
I don't know.

39:09.447 --> 39:10.615
We'll see what happens.

39:10.615 --> 39:11.416
How's Eva?

39:11.416 --> 39:12.383
Where is Eva?

39:12.383 --> 39:13.918
Hi, Mom.

39:13.918 --> 39:14.719
How are you?

39:20.124 --> 39:21.626
What's going on?

39:30.447 --> 39:32.337
[MUSIC PLAYING]

39:32.337 --> 39:33.304
How's Eva?

39:33.304 --> 39:34.105
Where is Eva?

39:34.105 --> 39:36.040
Hi, Mom.

39:36.040 --> 39:36.841
How are you?

39:39.978 --> 39:41.713
What's going on?

39:41.713 --> 39:43.314
My stomach was bothering me.

39:43.314 --> 39:44.849
I didn't think anything of it.

39:44.849 --> 39:48.753
So then on Thursday,
I wake up to go train.

39:48.753 --> 39:51.689
And literally, I looked like
I was carrying like a six

39:51.689 --> 39:53.324
month old baby in my stomach.

39:53.324 --> 39:54.125
Really?

39:54.125 --> 39:54.926
Yes.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.095
Then they find that I
had a cyst on my ovaries.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.229
You need to jump on it.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.030
Take care of it.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.032
Not just one opinion.

40:01.032 --> 40:01.833
Couple of opinions.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.735
So we've actually
been pretty proactive.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.236
I mean, we've gone to
three different doctors

40:05.236 --> 40:07.238
so far the past four days.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.941
If he wasn't here, I
literally, probably

40:09.941 --> 40:12.143
would have died on the floor.

40:12.143 --> 40:15.113
Because there's no way in
hell that I could have driven.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.015
My body looked crazy.

40:17.015 --> 40:19.384
Just so you guys to know,
like, whatever needs to get

40:19.384 --> 40:21.953
done for her, will get done.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.923
I'll do anything that I possibly
can to make sure she's OK.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.293
Whatever she needs, that's
my life right there.

40:28.293 --> 40:32.330
I don't think that I
would've been OK without him.

40:32.330 --> 40:34.599
Its a big deal to me.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.567
It's a big deal to us.

40:36.567 --> 40:39.437
In my mind, I didn't know
what I was coming into.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.806
When we come back
here today, like,

40:41.806 --> 40:44.642
mm, do I have to jump on
the [BLEEP] damn airplane

40:44.642 --> 40:46.878
every time something's
going on out here.

40:46.878 --> 40:50.448
It seems like every time we
come out here, it's a bomb.

40:50.448 --> 40:55.887
But hopefully we can get into
happy days instead of bombs.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.156
But it's certainly
nice coming in here,

40:58.156 --> 40:59.757
seeing her comfortable.

40:59.757 --> 41:01.326
Seeing that you're
trying to take

41:01.326 --> 41:03.161
care of business-- not trying
to take care of business.

41:03.161 --> 41:04.495
Taking care of business.

41:04.495 --> 41:06.965
Looks like you're crossing
one of the many hurdles

41:06.965 --> 41:09.267
that you're going to cross in--

41:09.267 --> 41:10.802
Just the beginning.

41:10.802 --> 41:11.602
In your life.

41:11.602 --> 41:12.403
It's the beginning.

41:12.403 --> 41:13.471
I love you.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.140
Last time I saw them,
it was, like, horrible.

41:16.140 --> 41:20.712
But now, it's like
[SIGH] it's my family.

41:20.712 --> 41:23.614
I get like all warm inside
because my dad's kind

41:23.614 --> 41:26.184
of breaking down that
wall a little bit.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.652
That's all I really
want in my life,

41:27.652 --> 41:31.055
is us to just be happy together.

41:31.055 --> 41:33.825
If you love somebody as
much as I love your father

41:33.825 --> 41:35.960
and, obviously,
Jonathan loves you.

41:35.960 --> 41:36.861
It doesn't matter.

41:36.861 --> 41:38.529
When you're down, we're there.

41:38.529 --> 41:39.330
It doesn't matter.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.898
We don't think about ourselves.

41:40.898 --> 41:44.502
Oh, baby, you know I love
it when you talk like that.

41:44.502 --> 41:50.141
[LAUGHTER] Oh my God.

41:50.141 --> 42:07.825
[MUSIC PLAYING]

42:07.825 --> 42:08.626
Um.

42:11.496 --> 42:14.632
I'm not good with speeches.

42:14.632 --> 42:17.802
I just want to say, Trinity,
welcome to the family

42:17.802 --> 42:22.173
and, um, thank you for
being in my son's life.

42:22.173 --> 42:23.541
You guys were made
for each other.

42:27.512 --> 42:29.480
It's all right, Mom.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.715
Aw.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.217
And Trinity, I
promise you, he will

42:33.217 --> 42:35.153
take such good care of you.

42:35.153 --> 42:37.121
Oh yeah.

42:37.121 --> 42:38.289
It's all good.

42:38.289 --> 42:39.090
Cheers!

42:46.364 --> 42:49.500
I wish there was another
word, other than love,

42:49.500 --> 42:52.003
to describe how I feel for Jon.

42:52.003 --> 42:54.572
I feel like love doesn't
explain or describe

42:54.572 --> 42:56.207
what I feel for him.

42:56.207 --> 42:58.843
I look forward to our
beautiful future together.

42:58.843 --> 43:00.745
Please hurry up and
have some babies.

43:00.745 --> 43:02.847
Whoa!

43:02.847 --> 43:04.882
This is what life is all about.

time on Total Divas.

43:14.492 --> 43:15.960
Thank you for the money.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.295
Oh yeah, no problem.

43:17.295 --> 43:18.529
I know nothing of this.

43:18.529 --> 43:20.064
You became my accountant
all of a sudden?

43:20.064 --> 43:20.865
I am your wife.

43:20.865 --> 43:22.867
I'm more important
than your accountant.

43:22.867 --> 43:25.136
Nice to meet you.

43:25.136 --> 43:28.473
Brie and I are on the set of
Tre Songz's music video shoot.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.979
I'm super excited to
go house sit for Nattie.

43:34.979 --> 43:36.614
Have you guys seen the cat?

43:36.614 --> 43:39.250
Nattie is going to kill me.

43:39.250 --> 43:42.420
Has anybody seen Nattie's pussy?
