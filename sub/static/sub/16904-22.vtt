00:19.226 --> 00:21.060
- I'm in Beijing!
- Shh.

00:21.128 --> 00:23.229
- Liddy just went to sleep.
- Well, wake here up, Jack.

00:23.297 --> 00:25.264
She needs to hear
her mommy's voice.

00:25.332 --> 00:27.200
No, when she's ready,
Dr. Kevorkian says

00:27.267 --> 00:28.539
we have to put her down.

00:28.540 --> 00:29.774
He's a very good pediatrician,

00:29.842 --> 00:30.942
but that is
an unfortunate name.

00:31.010 --> 00:32.610
Oh, come on,
she'll fall back asleep.

00:32.677 --> 00:33.945
No. Call back tomorrow.

Imprinting! Imprinting!

00:43.454 --> 00:45.890
God, Tracy could have
cleaned up before he left.

00:45.941 --> 00:48.860
And why did he leave
all this soda here?

00:48.927 --> 00:50.528
What are you doing?
That's his urine.

00:50.596 --> 00:52.697
He is not well.

Someday this place is gonna be
a kickass duplex,

Conrad bain once slapped me
in a men's room.

00:59.004 --> 01:00.705
I've just gotta get rid
of all these boxes.

I don't even know
what this stuff is anymore.

"Liz stabbed Jenna
repeatedly."

- Ehh...

01:22.027 --> 01:24.462
It works, Liz.
Look at me.

01:24.530 --> 01:26.230
Ever since I started
secreting,

01:26.298 --> 01:29.067
I've become a TV star,
I found my soul mate,

01:29.134 --> 01:31.936
you saw how flat Gwyneth Paltrow
sang at the oscars...

01:32.004 --> 01:34.372
I visualized all of that.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.207
Jenna, the only way
to make things happen

01:36.275 --> 01:38.309
in the real world
is by taking action.

01:38.377 --> 01:39.577
Oh, I've taken action.

01:39.645 --> 01:42.246
It dries your mouth out,
but the sex is amazing.

01:42.314 --> 01:44.415
No, I'm talking about
taking control.

01:44.483 --> 01:46.584
Like I do every day at work.

01:46.652 --> 01:48.486
I found Tracy,
I saved the show.

01:48.554 --> 01:51.255
I always think of a third
thing when I'm listing stuff.

01:51.323 --> 01:52.924
If taking control
is so great,

01:52.991 --> 01:55.293
then how do you explain
your personal life?

01:55.360 --> 01:57.261
I mean, look at the post-it
note on your sweater.

01:59.331 --> 02:01.432
Oh, boy.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.035
You're right.

02:04.103 --> 02:05.236
I just have to care
about myself

02:05.304 --> 02:07.038
as much as I care
about work.

02:07.106 --> 02:08.106
Starting right now.

02:08.173 --> 02:09.574
I'm gonna clean this apartment

02:09.640 --> 02:11.559

02:11.643 --> 02:13.511
Last year, I used <i>The Secret</i>

Great news, Jack.

02:45.644 --> 02:48.513
I've got a new life philosophy
that I call <i>Lizbeanism.</i>

02:48.580 --> 02:50.731
I see. And how did you
come up with that name?

02:50.816 --> 02:52.283
Well, I'm Liz,
and obviously,

02:52.351 --> 02:54.852
my philosophy is simple,
like a bean.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.554
I'm fixing problems
in my personal life

02:56.622 --> 02:58.289
the same way
I fix problems at work.

02:58.357 --> 03:01.325
I saved the show,
now I'm gonna save me!

03:01.393 --> 03:04.996
Because lizbeanism means
that I am a dyke...

03:05.063 --> 03:07.632
against the rising waters
of mediocrity.

03:07.699 --> 03:09.834
- Good for you, Lemon.
- Check this out, Jack.

03:09.902 --> 03:12.153
Tile samples.
First, I redo the bathroom,

03:12.237 --> 03:15.490
then I redo the whole apartment,
and then the world.

03:15.574 --> 03:18.442
I'm impressed, Lemon.
You're talking like a winner.

03:18.510 --> 03:20.845

This is a big moment for me.

03:30.856 --> 03:32.423
You're taking control
of your destiny.

No matter how strait
the gate

03:34.126 --> 03:35.993
or charged with punishments
the scroll,

03:36.061 --> 03:38.129
I am the master of my fate,

03:38.197 --> 03:40.965
I am the captain of my soul.

03:41.033 --> 03:42.400
That's from <i>Invictus!</i>

03:42.467 --> 03:44.001
Wait, who was the white guy
in that?

03:44.069 --> 03:46.821
Maybe someday
you'll be like me,

corporation,

03:48.674 --> 03:50.358

for the privilege

03:50.425 --> 03:52.743
of cutting your hair...
raising a child.

03:52.811 --> 03:54.545
<i>You're</i> raising a child?
Come on.

03:54.613 --> 03:56.047
I think Avery is probably
doing that.

03:56.114 --> 03:57.748
Not really. Avery's been
traveling a lot

03:57.816 --> 04:01.419
as part of NBC news' hot blondes
in weird places initiative.

04:01.486 --> 04:03.154
So she's been out
of the baby loop

04:03.222 --> 04:04.889
until Liddy is sleep-trained.

04:04.957 --> 04:06.156
Frankly, it might be easier

04:06.208 --> 04:08.175
if Avery stays in Asia.

04:08.260 --> 04:09.493
Be careful
what you wish for.

I can have inside jokes
that you're not a part of.

19:00.138 --> 19:02.189
please let it go.
It's just a joke

19:02.274 --> 19:04.275
it's not about the joke.

19:04.342 --> 19:06.860
It's about what the joke
represents, you monsters!

19:06.945 --> 19:08.312
What do you mean, sir?

19:08.363 --> 19:10.481
I came back,
and you were fine without me.

19:10.532 --> 19:12.182
You laughed without me!

19:12.234 --> 19:13.984
And that was
our special thing!

19:14.052 --> 19:17.187
But no, you thought
smooth move, Ferguson,

19:17.239 --> 19:18.722
was so hilarious!

19:18.790 --> 19:21.575
[Sobbing] It wasn't.
It wasn't funny!

19:21.660 --> 19:23.193
There, are you happy?

19:23.261 --> 19:25.362
You just dropped a bomb, K.
Continue.

19:25.413 --> 19:27.665
We were miserable
without you, sir.

19:27.732 --> 19:31.335
"Smooth move, Ferguson"
was trying to fill a void

19:31.403 --> 19:33.220
because Mr. Slattery's
political cartoons

19:33.305 --> 19:34.371
weren't cutting it.

19:34.439 --> 19:35.923
I can't draw hands.

19:36.007 --> 19:38.242
You're the one
who makes us laugh.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.177
Never go away again.

19:40.228 --> 19:41.879
[Bawling]

19:41.947 --> 19:45.249
Don't ever tell me
what to do!

19:45.317 --> 19:49.436
Quad hug, me in the middle!

19:49.521 --> 19:51.288
Also, due to
a paperwork mix-up,

19:51.356 --> 19:53.791
you will not be
getting paid this month.

19:53.858 --> 19:55.359
[Bawling]

19:55.427 --> 19:58.195
I did it, Jack.
I got the bag.

19:58.246 --> 19:59.997
You were right.
No matter how much

20:00.065 --> 20:01.532
the gate is strait,

20:01.599 --> 20:03.434
or who punishes the scrolls,

20:03.501 --> 20:07.404
I am the captain
of my holes, or whatever.

20:07.455 --> 20:09.239
We are in control!

20:09.291 --> 20:11.175
No, we aren't.
I was wrong.

20:11.242 --> 20:15.946
Condi tried, but Avery
plus freedom equals...

20:16.014 --> 20:17.114
Frowny face.

20:17.182 --> 20:20.917
I'm sorry, what's happening?

20:20.969 --> 20:22.252
[Applause]

20:22.320 --> 20:23.787
They're never going
to let her go.

20:23.855 --> 20:27.558
Avery is now married
to Kim Jong-Il's son...

20:27.625 --> 20:28.792
Kim Jong-Un.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.061
What?
[Bicycle bell ringing]

20:37.100 --> 20:39.269
Nooo!

20:39.321 --> 20:41.105
Mortality!

20:41.172 --> 20:42.840
Smooth move, Ferguson.

20:44.734 --> 20:47.536
Put that coffee down.

20:47.604 --> 20:49.467
Coffee for closer only!

20:49.653 --> 20:51.527
I'm here from Park and Kim.

20:51.528 --> 20:53.798
I'm here on a mission
of mercy.

20:53.799 --> 20:56.047
- Your name Levine?
- Yeah.

20:56.048 --> 20:57.516
You call yourself a
salesman, you son of a bitch?

20:57.583 --> 20:59.117
I don't have to listen
to this.

20:59.185 --> 21:01.686
No, you don't, pal.
'Cause the good news is

21:01.754 --> 21:03.221
you're fired!

21:03.289 --> 21:05.373
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

21:05.441 --> 21:07.959
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

21:08.027 --> 21:10.795
You're weak!
Luke, I am your father.

21:10.863 --> 21:12.964
Ghostbusters!
Let's go, black partner.
