WEBVTT

00:05.296 --> 00:06.927
Well, I better head out.

00:06.927 --> 00:08.299
I don't want to be late
for the competition.

00:08.299 --> 00:10.341
Not just
any competition, Son.

00:10.341 --> 00:12.473
The BMX regional finals.

00:12.473 --> 00:16.397
Three days of grueling
bike on boke action.

00:16.397 --> 00:18.229
I read your poster,
and I think there's a typo.

00:19.900 --> 00:22.233
You know, regional finalists run
in the family.

00:22.233 --> 00:24.445
My great-great-grandfather
Elwood Steincrotch

00:24.445 --> 00:25.986
was a regional finalist

00:25.986 --> 00:29.150
in The Great Snake Oil
Selling Contest of 1892.

00:29.150 --> 00:32.363
Swindled over 300 people
in 90 minutes.

00:32.363 --> 00:36.497
And that's why they say
"Never trust a Steincrotch."

00:39.330 --> 00:42.213
Tyler, the point is
we are very proud of you.

00:42.213 --> 00:44.755
You've worked really hard
and it's all paid off.

00:44.755 --> 00:46.167
I know you're gonna do great,

00:46.167 --> 00:48.048
but just to seal it,

00:48.048 --> 00:49.300
I want you to have this.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.552
This mixtape
is good luck, Tyler.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.304
I was listening to it
when Luke Mandell called

00:53.304 --> 00:54.725
and asked me
to the prom.

00:54.725 --> 00:56.307
True, he thought he was
calling Ellen Jenkins

00:56.307 --> 00:57.848
and not Ellen Jennings.

00:57.848 --> 01:00.731
But then I told him
I was Ellen Jenkins.

01:00.731 --> 01:02.393
Never trust
a Steincrotch.

01:04.145 --> 01:06.357
Mom, I'm not going to the prom
with Luke Mandell.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.949
I don't blame you.
I hear he let himself go.

01:08.949 --> 01:10.491
Look, I got to get going.

01:10.491 --> 01:11.992
I don't want to be late
for the competition

01:11.992 --> 01:13.404
and leave my friends
waiting.

01:13.404 --> 01:14.745
Good luck, Tyler.

01:14.745 --> 01:16.997
We're so proud of you.

01:16.997 --> 01:18.999
Don't drink
the hotel tap water,

01:18.999 --> 01:20.371
it's not clean.

01:20.371 --> 01:21.412
And don't drink
the bottled water,

01:21.412 --> 01:23.164
it's too expensive.

01:23.164 --> 01:25.045
But drink lots of water.
It's good for you.

01:26.507 --> 01:29.380
So, thank you

01:29.380 --> 01:31.802
for choosing me
over Luke Mandell.

01:31.802 --> 01:34.305
Well, thank you
for keeping it tight.

01:41.722 --> 01:44.935
Wow, those three days
went by really fast.

01:44.935 --> 01:46.437
So did you enjoy the prom?

01:46.437 --> 01:47.228
I didn't go to the prom.

01:47.228 --> 01:48.229
( gasps )

01:48.229 --> 01:49.860
Luke stood you up?

01:51.402 --> 01:53.404
Come on,
I'll go to the prom with you.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.156
I don't care
what people might think.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.037
We'll walk into that gym
and slow dance

01:57.037 --> 01:58.619
right in front of that jerk.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.913
Stan, I'm home
because I didn't qualify

02:02.913 --> 02:04.585
for the BMX competition.

02:04.585 --> 02:06.587
I goofed off
and I didn't work hard enough.

02:06.587 --> 02:08.339
I let everyone down.

02:08.339 --> 02:10.801
I can't even show my face
around my teammates.

02:10.801 --> 02:12.423
And I really can't let
Mom and Dad know.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.014
So what are you
going to do?

02:14.014 --> 02:15.926
Hide in my room
and watch cartoons on my phone

02:15.926 --> 02:17.308
under the covers
for the next three days

02:17.308 --> 02:19.019
so Mom and Dad keep thinking
I'm a grown up.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.853
BENNETT: Well, what did
the exterminator say?

02:22.853 --> 02:24.855
Three days is the perfect
amount of time

02:24.855 --> 02:26.267
to flea bomb
Tyler's room.

02:26.267 --> 02:27.268
BENNETT: All right,
we just need to make sure

02:27.268 --> 02:28.899
no one goes in there.

02:28.899 --> 02:31.192
Yeah. We'll have to
"flea" the premises.

02:31.192 --> 02:33.194
You know, "bug" out.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.406
Good one, Ellen,
good one, Ellen.

02:35.406 --> 02:38.239
That was
a one-two pun...ch.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.781
I may have a problem.

02:44.245 --> 02:45.586
Stan, if I can't
hide in my room,

02:45.586 --> 02:47.208
where am I gonna go?

02:47.208 --> 02:50.791
How about to the vet?
'Cause one of us has fleas.

02:52.423 --> 02:54.255
Giving Tyler that good advice

02:54.255 --> 02:56.467
about going to the vet
made me think.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.679
Now that I have
my kids full time,

02:58.679 --> 03:01.061
I need to start teaching
them stuff, too.

03:01.061 --> 03:03.724
And I'm not the only
new parent around here.

03:03.724 --> 03:05.356
Right, Robert?

03:07.808 --> 03:10.691
They are so adorable.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.484
Are you setting up
a college fund for them?

03:13.484 --> 03:17.278
Well, when were you going
to think about it, Robert?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.757
Hey, Avery,
I need your advice.

03:36.757 --> 03:38.389
Yeah?

03:38.389 --> 03:40.601
My friend Jules said
we weren't friends anymore.

03:40.601 --> 03:41.932
Then after recess,

03:41.932 --> 03:43.554
she said we were
best friends again.

03:43.554 --> 03:45.976
It's the third time
she's done this.

03:45.976 --> 03:49.520
Can't a girl monkey-bar it up
without all the drama?

03:49.520 --> 03:52.313
Chloe, life is way too short
to have a best friend

03:52.313 --> 03:53.734
to makes you feel bad.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.406
That's not what
friendship should be.

03:55.406 --> 03:58.158
See, Avery, this is why
I come to you for advice.

03:58.158 --> 03:59.490
You always take care of me.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.241
Like the time
I accidentally broke the lamp

04:01.241 --> 04:02.453
in Mommy and Daddy's bedroom.

04:02.453 --> 04:03.574
When did that happen?

04:03.574 --> 04:05.286
BENNETT: Chloe?

04:05.286 --> 04:06.787
So, how do I play this?

04:12.543 --> 04:13.834
So this is where
you're gonna hide

04:13.834 --> 04:15.336
from your parents
for three days?

04:15.336 --> 04:18.258
It's not so bad.
I made a nest from my clothes.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.970
Chloe's tea set is down here.

04:19.970 --> 04:22.433
Ooh, fake tea.

04:22.433 --> 04:23.804
Ah, fake hot, fake hot!

04:25.185 --> 04:26.597
So, what did you bring me?

04:26.597 --> 04:29.480
Apple cores, banana peels,
and coffee grounds.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.602
This is garbage.
I can't eat this.

04:31.602 --> 04:33.854
Well, not with that
attitude.

04:33.854 --> 04:36.737
Why couldn't you've brought me
something from the fridge?

04:36.737 --> 04:38.399
'Cause I can't open
the dang door.

04:38.399 --> 04:40.030
It's my one weakness.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.403
But I'm on a mission
to teach my kids stuff.

04:42.403 --> 04:45.456
Maybe it's time they learned
the lesson of persistence.

04:45.456 --> 04:48.579
So I rigged this to open
the refrigerator door.

04:48.579 --> 04:51.251
Once you learn how to use
block and tackle equipment,

04:51.251 --> 04:53.003
you can do anything.

04:59.259 --> 05:02.182
Okay, I may need
to learn how to use

05:02.182 --> 05:03.974
block and tackle equipment.

05:07.227 --> 05:09.480
Thanks for coming with me
to break up with Jules.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.891
I want to be here for you.

05:10.891 --> 05:12.232
That's what
big sisters are for.

05:12.232 --> 05:14.935
Plus, I have the core
temperature of a lizard,

05:14.935 --> 05:16.697
and this gives me the chance
to sun myself on a rock.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.070
I'm kidding.
I'm just a slender mammal

05:20.070 --> 05:21.612
who chills easily.

05:23.243 --> 05:24.244
CHLOE: There she is.

05:24.244 --> 05:25.706
All right,
Just remember,

05:25.706 --> 05:27.748
be firm and don't back down.

05:27.748 --> 05:29.039
Go.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.212
Hey.

05:33.914 --> 05:36.507
STAN:
O-M-Gosh, that's Dax,

05:36.507 --> 05:38.839
the boy Avery
has a crazy crush on.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.340
Don't take my word for it.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.383
Look, what happened
a couple of days ago.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.305
Wow, Avery,

05:45.305 --> 05:47.468
you are really
into those cookies.

05:47.468 --> 05:49.850
No, I am really
into the boy

05:49.850 --> 05:52.142
who works at the cookie kiosk
at the mall.

05:52.142 --> 05:54.395
To see him,
I buy cookies now and then.

05:58.188 --> 06:00.481
I really like to see him.

06:01.652 --> 06:02.863
His name is...

06:02.863 --> 06:04.405
( sighs )

06:04.405 --> 06:05.536
...Dax.

06:05.536 --> 06:06.537
So what's...

06:06.537 --> 06:08.198
( sighs )

06:08.198 --> 06:09.249
...Dax like?

06:10.621 --> 06:11.992
Do you guys
have a lot in common?

06:11.992 --> 06:14.124
Do you share
the same interests?

06:14.124 --> 06:15.295
I have no clue.

06:15.295 --> 06:17.047
All I know is
I'm a teenage girl

06:17.047 --> 06:18.839
and he's stupid-hot.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.381
I know you.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.423
I'm not sweating.
I mean "hey."

06:24.304 --> 06:27.057
You're by far my best
and hungriest customer.

06:27.057 --> 06:30.270
Nom-nom-nom.
I also do celery.

06:30.270 --> 06:31.512
Crunch-crunch-crunch.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.395
It's cool our sisters
are such good friends.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.277
I bet your mother
would love me, too-- What?

06:39.229 --> 06:41.191
No, I just mean
I'm the type of girl

06:41.191 --> 06:42.693
whole families love--
Huh?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.197
So I guess we can hang out
and get to know each other

06:47.197 --> 06:48.288
while they're playing.

06:48.288 --> 06:49.950
This is my chance with...

06:49.950 --> 06:51.331
( sighs )

06:51.331 --> 06:52.833
...Dax.

06:54.795 --> 06:57.167
I can't let Chloe
blow it for me.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.039
Excuse me.
Just one second.

06:59.039 --> 07:00.380
There's something
really difficult

07:00.380 --> 07:01.421
I need to talk to you about!

07:01.421 --> 07:03.133
( crash )

07:06.216 --> 07:07.638
Sorry, tripped.

07:09.309 --> 07:11.051
Anyway,
before you say something

07:11.051 --> 07:12.262
that you can't take back,

07:12.262 --> 07:14.054
I may have been
a Dax hunky.

07:14.054 --> 07:16.056
I mean a tad hasty.

07:16.056 --> 07:17.357
Okay.
People can change.

07:17.357 --> 07:19.059
The point is,
you and Jules should

07:19.059 --> 07:21.061
stay best friends forever.

07:21.061 --> 07:23.113
Okay, Avery, if that's really
what you think.

07:23.113 --> 07:24.825
Yes, I really think Dax.

07:24.825 --> 07:26.567
I mean,
I really think that.

07:27.658 --> 07:29.239
I guess
I just kissed his face.

07:29.239 --> 07:30.491
I mean, spoke too soon.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.122
How did I even
get there from that?

07:33.283 --> 07:36.376
Now run along
and have fun with Jules.

07:36.376 --> 07:40.250
I'll find some way
to keep myself occupied.

07:44.795 --> 07:46.046
And then the bell goes off

07:46.046 --> 07:47.387
and you take 'em
out of the oven.

07:47.387 --> 07:49.139
But first
you put on the oven mitt.

07:50.390 --> 07:52.142
I bet you only make
that mistake once.

07:52.142 --> 07:53.143
Why?

07:54.304 --> 07:55.395
I don't know.

07:55.395 --> 07:57.598
Can I put my finger
in your dimple?

07:57.598 --> 07:59.479
Why does everyone
ask me that?

08:01.902 --> 08:03.483
Let's go home.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.986
I don't want to be friends
with Chloe anymore.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.739
Oh, no,
she's doing it to Chloe again.

08:08.739 --> 08:11.241
Why did I push Chloe
to stay friends with this kid?

08:11.241 --> 08:12.783
No guy is worth that,

08:12.783 --> 08:14.414
even if he does look like

08:14.414 --> 08:15.536
he was forged
in a lightning storm

08:15.536 --> 08:17.287
by Hephaestus's Hammer.

08:18.458 --> 08:20.170
What's so funny?

08:20.170 --> 08:21.251
Oh, I just thought of a joke
you'd never get.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.174
Hilarious.

08:25.335 --> 08:27.427
Well, I guess Chloe and I
should get going.

08:27.427 --> 08:28.929
It's too bad
they aren't friends anymore,

08:28.929 --> 08:30.390
because I wanted
to sketch you.

08:30.390 --> 08:31.471
I'm kind of an artist.

08:31.471 --> 08:32.512
You're an artist?

08:32.512 --> 08:34.264
I'm an artist, too.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.767
And I'm not just saying that
to make you love me back.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.809
I mean, love me back.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.311
Don't you just
love me back?

08:41.311 --> 08:42.482
Yeah, it's a nice back.

08:42.482 --> 08:43.904
You really think so?

08:45.145 --> 08:47.357
Too bad I got to
take my sister home.

08:47.357 --> 08:49.950
Maybe not yet.
Give me a sec.

08:49.950 --> 08:52.573
Hey, Jules,
how about this time

08:52.573 --> 08:54.324
you stay best friends
with Chloe?

08:54.324 --> 08:55.866
Maybe.

08:55.866 --> 08:58.538
That's a really
pretty bracelet.

08:58.538 --> 09:02.422
It would look so nice
on my wrist.

09:02.422 --> 09:05.836
How can something so evil
have a brother that's so cute?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.763
I'm back.

09:17.097 --> 09:19.269
So the mailman needed
a signature for the package

09:19.269 --> 09:20.310
so he rang the doorbell.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.311
Bing-dong!

09:21.311 --> 09:23.313
And I was like--
Hang on.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.394
Did you just say
"bing dong"?

09:25.856 --> 09:27.858
Yeah, you know,
the sound a doorbell makes.

09:27.858 --> 09:30.190
Where was I?
Anyway, so the mailman was--

09:30.190 --> 09:33.403
Honey, doorbells go
"ding dong."

09:33.403 --> 09:34.865
Not "bing dong."

09:34.865 --> 09:36.867
Whatever.
I've always heard bing dong.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.538
Anyway,
so the mailman was--

09:38.538 --> 09:40.460
Who says "bing dong?"

09:40.460 --> 09:43.373
I mean, name one person.

09:43.373 --> 09:45.205
I don't know, I think
I've heard you say it.

09:45.205 --> 09:46.667
No. No, no, no, no, no.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.378
I would never say
"bing dong."

09:48.378 --> 09:49.339
Relax.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.761
You know
the old expression,

09:50.761 --> 09:53.013
You say tomato,
I say potato.

09:54.214 --> 09:56.216
That is not an expression!

09:56.216 --> 09:59.099
Oh, Bennett,
put a rock in it.

10:10.941 --> 10:12.362
Baked?

10:17.658 --> 10:18.789
BOTH:
♪ Fish sticks, fish sticks ♪

10:18.789 --> 10:20.580
♪ Glitter and boys ♪

10:20.580 --> 10:23.954
♪ If you like these things,
then make a little noise! ♪

10:23.954 --> 10:26.166
Wha-whaaat?

10:27.668 --> 10:29.800
Hey, my sister
has that bracelet.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.341
Well, not anymore.

10:31.341 --> 10:34.054
Your sister gave it to me
so I stay friends with you.

10:34.054 --> 10:36.256
Do you even like fish sticks,
glitter, and boys,

10:36.256 --> 10:37.968
or is it all
a filthy lie?

10:39.389 --> 10:41.431
I'm so glad
our sisters made up.

10:41.431 --> 10:42.973
Me, too.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.314
And I've finished
my sketch of you.

10:46.977 --> 10:48.608
See?
'Cause you're a girl,

10:48.608 --> 10:50.360
and you like cookies.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.532
Now draw yourself as milk,
and dunk me.

10:52.532 --> 10:54.404
I'm kidding.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.575
Unless you want to.

10:57.367 --> 10:59.579
Avery, did you give Jules
your bracelet

10:59.579 --> 11:00.951
so she would stay
friends with me?

11:00.951 --> 11:02.993
Excuse me.

11:02.993 --> 11:04.835
I'm so sorry, Chloe.

11:04.835 --> 11:05.916
But in my defense...

11:08.879 --> 11:11.291
Hey, look how shiny I am.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.345
Avery, you did this to me
for a boy?

11:15.345 --> 11:17.097
You're worse than Jules.

11:17.097 --> 11:18.348
You're not my sister
anymore!

11:21.431 --> 11:23.393
If you throw in
that necklace,

11:23.393 --> 11:24.935
I'll be your sister.

11:30.901 --> 11:32.813
Now, as family dogs,

11:32.813 --> 11:35.235
part of our job
is to help our people.

11:35.235 --> 11:38.158
And they'll be coming to you
with all kinds of problems,

11:38.158 --> 11:40.370
'cause they are a hot mess.

11:40.370 --> 11:42.122
Stan, I'm sitting
right here.

11:42.122 --> 11:43.283
And are you a hot mess?

11:43.283 --> 11:44.664
Yes.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.629
Chloe, I am so sorry about
what happened earlier.

11:49.629 --> 11:51.091
Please, don't be mad at me.

11:51.091 --> 11:53.333
Of course,
I'm mad at you.

11:53.333 --> 11:56.256
I trusted you,
and you lied to me and used me.

11:56.256 --> 11:58.338
And I am so sorry.

11:58.338 --> 12:00.430
I just got
a little carried away.

12:00.430 --> 12:02.843
One day you'll understand
that liking boys

12:02.843 --> 12:04.514
can make you do dumb things.

12:04.514 --> 12:06.056
I'll never understand.

12:06.056 --> 12:07.307
What you did is terrible.

12:07.307 --> 12:09.019
Chloe,
we're still sisters--

12:09.019 --> 12:12.352
No, I told you,
you're not my sister anymore.

12:14.564 --> 12:17.357
Now you may have noticed that
Avery and Chloe had a fight.

12:19.199 --> 12:22.242
A dog's job is to be on hand
for sympathy petting.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.573
Science tells us

12:23.573 --> 12:26.036
our fur is lined
with tiny molecules

12:26.036 --> 12:28.248
called
"feel-betterinos."

12:29.499 --> 12:31.832
Not to be confused
with Phil Betterino,

12:31.832 --> 12:33.213
who has that pizza place.

12:33.213 --> 12:34.544
You know their motto.

12:34.544 --> 12:36.837
"It's not the best,
it's Betterino!"

12:38.718 --> 12:41.761
Stan, I'm really upset about
what's happening with Chloe.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.223
This isn't a time for jokes.

12:43.223 --> 12:44.764
Avery,
if I was doing jokes,

12:44.764 --> 12:47.647
you'd be hearing me say
things like "Am I right?"

12:47.647 --> 12:50.390
Or, "What's the deal
with that?"

12:50.390 --> 12:53.653
Or, "I'd like to be
at that meeting."

12:54.734 --> 12:56.236
I need to talk to Chloe.

12:56.236 --> 12:58.488
I'd like to be
at that meeting.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.491
Now, pet the puppies,

13:01.491 --> 13:04.664
and let the "feel-betterinos"
do their thing.

13:04.664 --> 13:06.366
Stan, this is not
something that--

13:06.366 --> 13:09.249
Oh, my gosh,
I do feel better.

13:09.249 --> 13:10.710
Science!

13:13.413 --> 13:15.295
Oh, I've been in here so long,

13:15.295 --> 13:17.087
I think
I'm starting to lose it.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.919
But I'm holding it together,
aren't I, Tennie?

13:21.381 --> 13:24.304
Why am I asking a tennis ball
if I'm losing it?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.096
You have no background
in clinical psychology.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.479
I know Tyler's
only been gone a day,

13:29.479 --> 13:31.892
but I do miss
my little Ty-Ty.

13:31.892 --> 13:33.433
I even miss the way
he used to say,

13:33.433 --> 13:36.276
"I'm 18,
stop calling me Ty-Ty."

13:36.276 --> 13:38.068
Maybe you should
give him a call.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.070
He'll hear his phone go
"cling-cling"

13:40.070 --> 13:41.441
and he'll answer.

13:41.441 --> 13:44.364
I know phones go
"ring-ring."

13:44.364 --> 13:45.785
I'm not a bing-a-ling.

13:47.247 --> 13:48.288
Who did I marry?

13:48.288 --> 13:49.289
Whom.

13:49.289 --> 13:50.370
Oh, that you know.

13:53.003 --> 13:55.215
Oh, no, Tennie.
It's Mom and Dad calling.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.459
Tennie, play it cool.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.553
Hello.

14:03.553 --> 14:06.386
Hi, sweetie,
I was just missing you

14:06.386 --> 14:07.517
so I thought
I'd give you a call.

14:07.517 --> 14:09.019
How's the competition going?

14:09.019 --> 14:10.390
Sounds real quiet there.

14:10.390 --> 14:13.433
No, no.
There's lots of stuff going on.

14:13.433 --> 14:15.355
There are tons of girls here.

14:15.355 --> 14:19.569
"Oh, look, there's Tyler.
He's so cute."

14:19.569 --> 14:21.741
Oh, the Blue Angels
are doing a fly-by.

14:21.741 --> 14:24.484
( imitating jet planes )

14:24.484 --> 14:27.247
Oh, look,
here come the girls again.

14:27.247 --> 14:29.579
"We were so nervous
to talk to you,

14:29.579 --> 14:33.083
but the Blue Angels
inspired us to take a risk."

14:34.995 --> 14:38.378
Be nice to those girls.
They sound homely.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.379
Hey!

14:41.091 --> 14:42.802
So listen, your Dad
wants to say hi, too.

14:42.802 --> 14:44.804
( mumbling )

14:47.597 --> 14:48.718
Dad?

14:48.718 --> 14:50.310
Hey, Son.

14:50.310 --> 14:52.142
As a renowned
child psychologist,

14:52.142 --> 14:53.353
I want to wish you luck.

14:53.353 --> 14:54.394
Mom?

14:54.394 --> 14:55.605
Bye, Tyler.
Bye, Mom.

14:57.437 --> 14:58.939
You know,
if you really miss Tyler,

14:58.939 --> 15:00.280
we should drive up
for the competition tomorrow

15:00.280 --> 15:01.281
and surprise him.

15:01.281 --> 15:02.282
Oh, yeah.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.619
Here, Avery.
I want to give this to you.

15:09.619 --> 15:11.331
Oh, good,
you're talking to me.

15:11.331 --> 15:13.663
So you're not angry anymore?
We're sisters again?

15:13.663 --> 15:16.376
I'm not angry anymore,
but we're still not sisters.

15:16.376 --> 15:17.797
So I want to give
all this to you.

15:18.838 --> 15:20.250
What is it?

15:22.802 --> 15:25.215
Chloe,
I gave you this doll.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.098
And I made you this card
for your birthday.

15:28.098 --> 15:29.679
What is going on?

15:29.679 --> 15:32.262
It's all the stuff that I saved
in my special memory box

15:32.262 --> 15:33.974
from everything
we've done together.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.186
Since we're not sisters anymore,
I don't want it.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.398
All right, Chloe.
Enough.

15:38.398 --> 15:41.231
I know that I messed up,
but I've already apologized.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.273
I'll do whatever you want
to make it up to you,

15:43.273 --> 15:44.404
but you can't stay
mad at me.

15:44.404 --> 15:45.775
I said I'm not mad.

15:45.775 --> 15:47.367
I'm just following
your advice.

15:47.367 --> 15:48.618
You told me life's too short
to have a best friend

15:48.618 --> 15:49.829
that makes you feel bad.

15:49.829 --> 15:51.571
Yeah,
I was talking about Jules.

15:51.571 --> 15:54.244
Jules was never
my best friend,

15:54.244 --> 15:55.415
you were.

16:04.424 --> 16:06.176
Ellen, come on!

16:06.176 --> 16:07.507
If we want to make it
for Tyler's competition,

16:07.507 --> 16:08.718
we've got to leave now!

16:13.223 --> 16:14.854
Okay, Tennie.

16:14.854 --> 16:16.686
We can't let them
get out of this house.

16:16.686 --> 16:17.857
You ready?

16:23.153 --> 16:25.315
Do you have the directions
to Tyler's competition?

16:25.315 --> 16:26.736
I loaded them
onto my phone.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.528
Good.

16:28.528 --> 16:30.200
Huh, that's weird.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.411
I could've sworn
I left it right here.

16:31.411 --> 16:33.323
Relax,
Mama's on the case.

16:33.323 --> 16:34.324
I'll grab my purse
from the kitchen

16:34.324 --> 16:35.915
and call your cell
from mine.

16:35.915 --> 16:37.707
I have you under
husband, therapist,

16:37.707 --> 16:38.918
and keeping it tight.

16:42.832 --> 16:44.254
What was that?

16:49.259 --> 16:50.970
Where's my purse?
It was just here.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.432
I think
I saw it in my office.

17:00.350 --> 17:01.771
Purse, purse,
purse, purse, purse...

17:03.943 --> 17:05.735
Wait, I already have it.
Why did I run in here?

17:07.197 --> 17:10.240
I could've sworn
you left it right here.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.412
First your phone,
now my purse.

17:12.412 --> 17:14.284
Bennett,
I'm being totally serious.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.206
Do we have a leprechaun?

17:16.206 --> 17:19.419
Let's just call my phone
from the landline, huh?

17:19.419 --> 17:20.420
Okay.

17:28.378 --> 17:30.380
( siren blaring )

17:32.051 --> 17:33.973
Tyler?
What is going on?

17:33.973 --> 17:35.385
No time to explain.

17:35.385 --> 17:36.766
We've got a tiny fire
to put out.

17:36.766 --> 17:39.939
( imitating siren )
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:39.939 --> 17:41.731
Why are you not
at the competition?

17:43.233 --> 17:47.357
Actually, I never left
for the competition.

17:47.357 --> 17:50.240
I didn't qualify
because I goofed off.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.531
So I just spent
the past three days

17:51.531 --> 17:53.153
hiding under the stairs.

17:53.153 --> 17:55.155
But I heard those girls
on the phone.

17:55.155 --> 17:57.787
That was me, Mom.

17:57.787 --> 17:59.329
And the Blue Angels?

18:02.332 --> 18:04.464
Are you kidding me?

18:06.256 --> 18:07.667
Why didn't you tell us?

18:07.667 --> 18:09.419
I was too embarrassed.

18:09.419 --> 18:12.422
I let everyone down,
especially you guys.

18:13.473 --> 18:14.884
So what's my punishment?

18:16.596 --> 18:19.929
There is no punishment.
You're almost an adult.

18:19.929 --> 18:21.851
You're gonna have to deal
with the consequences

18:21.851 --> 18:23.223
of your own actions.

18:23.223 --> 18:24.814
That's what
being an adult is.

18:24.814 --> 18:26.896
So I don't get
any punishment at all?

18:26.896 --> 18:28.568
Well, you missed
your competition,

18:28.568 --> 18:30.280
you let your
teammates down.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.031
Is this how you want
to live your life?

18:32.031 --> 18:33.613
'Cause it's up to you now.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.406
Wow. I really am almost
an adult now, aren't I?

18:37.997 --> 18:39.449
I guess I have to
take that seriously.

18:39.449 --> 18:41.291
Thank you, guys,
for showing me that.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.294
Things are really gonna be
different from now on.

18:44.294 --> 18:45.795
Come on, fire truck.
( siren blaring )

18:48.298 --> 18:50.420
I haven't slept much
in the last few days.

18:54.464 --> 18:56.426
What's all this?

18:56.426 --> 18:59.138
Welcome to Sister-Con.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.260
It's like Comic-Con,

19:00.260 --> 19:02.021
but instead of
all the cool stuff,

19:02.021 --> 19:03.473
it's all about sisters.

19:04.974 --> 19:06.936
Then why are you
wearing that?

19:06.936 --> 19:08.728
I'm Bat-Stan.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.732
What does Bat-Stan
have to do with sisters?

19:12.732 --> 19:14.574
This is my costume
for Comic-Con.

19:14.574 --> 19:15.985
It took me
forever to make,

19:15.985 --> 19:18.157
I'm not just gonna
wear it once.

19:19.279 --> 19:21.281
And you're dressed
as Chloe, right?

19:21.281 --> 19:22.872
I am Chloe.

19:22.872 --> 19:26.996
Wow, you are really
committed to cosplay.

19:28.748 --> 19:30.169
All right, I've got it
from here, Stan.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.341
Thank you.

19:31.341 --> 19:33.293
If you need me,
just use this.

19:37.887 --> 19:40.350
Or just call out
"Bat-Stan, come here, boy."

19:40.350 --> 19:41.431
That works, too.

19:44.103 --> 19:46.806
So, Chloe, I was going
through the box you gave me,

19:46.806 --> 19:50.520
and it looked like a little
collection of memorabilia.

19:50.520 --> 19:53.273
So I got the idea
to make this exhibition.

19:53.273 --> 19:54.484
How long is this
going to take?

19:54.484 --> 19:57.447
Well, the walking tour
takes 25 minutes.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.949
You've got five.
Okay, then.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.661
I'll talk faster than

20:01.661 --> 20:03.202
Stan's Patrick
Stewart impression

20:03.202 --> 20:04.374
on the recording.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.207
This is my first lipstick
that you gave me.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.879
I forgot this was
in my box.

20:09.879 --> 20:11.461
Yeah.

20:11.461 --> 20:15.214
I spent all afternoon
teaching you how to use makeup.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.797
And here's a picture
of the first time you used it.

20:17.797 --> 20:19.178
On the kitchen wall.

20:21.010 --> 20:22.392
And here's the picture
of Mom freaking out

20:22.392 --> 20:23.723
after she saw it.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.145
You really captured
her impotent rage.

20:28.478 --> 20:31.271
Hey, I remember this.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.853
This is the first painting
you ever painted of me.

20:33.853 --> 20:37.357
And I painted you exactly
how you told me to.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.362
I'm glad you talked me
out of the saxophone.

20:42.362 --> 20:43.453
Too much.

20:45.535 --> 20:48.918
This is the macaroni necklace
I made you when I was six.

20:48.918 --> 20:50.540
This wasn't
in my memory box.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.921
No.

20:51.921 --> 20:53.252
It was
in my memory box.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.755
Avery,
you have one, too?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.587
Of course.

20:57.587 --> 20:59.799
You're not the only one
who treasures our memories.

21:01.140 --> 21:04.263
I know that I messed up,
but look around.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.437
We have so many
good memories together.

21:07.437 --> 21:11.601
And I hope that I can have
my best friend and sister back

21:11.601 --> 21:14.193
to fill this
new box I made

21:14.193 --> 21:15.605
with new memories.

21:17.857 --> 21:19.359
This will be
our first new memory.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.206
I love you, Chloe.

21:27.206 --> 21:29.078
I love you too, Avery.

21:29.078 --> 21:31.250
You will always be my sister.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.586
Awww.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.548
( in masculine voice )
I mean, "aah."

21:40.420 --> 21:43.383
Stan, I never thanked you
for helping me set this all up.

21:43.383 --> 21:44.684
And you'll never have to.

21:44.684 --> 21:46.686
Actually,
you probably should.

21:46.686 --> 21:48.267
I worked really hard.

21:49.268 --> 21:51.230
We all learned a lot.

21:51.230 --> 21:53.192
Avery learned
you have a responsibility

21:53.192 --> 21:55.775
not to take your
loved ones for granted.

21:55.775 --> 21:57.196
Tyler learned
you have to be responsible

21:57.196 --> 21:59.198
for your own actions.

21:59.198 --> 22:02.241
And I learned my puppies
and I have the same taste

22:02.241 --> 22:04.364
in chew toys!

22:06.866 --> 22:10.209
Look at you, Robert,
bursting with pride.

22:10.209 --> 22:13.332
Your kids are entering
the family business.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.756
"It's not the best,
it's Betterino!"
