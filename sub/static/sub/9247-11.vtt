"Hey, thanks for making
breakfast, sweetie."

00:19.584 --> 00:22.370
You're kidding.
Who eats fish for breakfast?

00:22.457 --> 00:24.894
Women, trying to increase
their odds of getting pregnant

00:24.981 --> 00:26.461
by boosting their omega-3s

00:26.548 --> 00:28.463
and their supporting
and loving husbands.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.553
Wait, so I have to eat it too?

00:31.640 --> 00:34.904
Upping our protein is better
for both of us, and our baby.

down this crap, so do you.

Yeah, it's a cup of fish water.

It's herbal tea, Mike.

have a cup of coffee.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.762
Mike, I read the caffeine

01:06.849 --> 01:09.591

the viscosity of a man's sperm.

any sense at all.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.869
Who knows what's going on
under that cheap-ass wig?

10:08.956 --> 10:11.436
Alright, I guess you can
crash on the couch tonight.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.787
- Thanks, man.
- Okay.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.353
Hey, baby. Good news, we
don't have to sleep in my car.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.355
Wait a second.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.140
Do me a favor, when she
comes in, introduce yourself

10:19.227 --> 10:21.098
'cause I can't remember
her name.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.667
Hey. This isn't a party.

10:24.754 --> 10:27.670
It's just two gay guys
eating a banana split.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.980
I haven't had one bite of that.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.111
[instrumental music]

10:38.812 --> 10:40.030
I added a scoop of peanut butter

10:40.117 --> 10:41.336
so we'd have
something to dip 'em in.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.424
Otherwise we're
just eating an apple.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.644
Ah. Ooh.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.168
- Who was that at the door?
- Huh? Oh, it was Carl.

10:47.255 --> 10:48.517
He needed a place
to crash tonight

10:48.604 --> 10:50.780
so I gave him the couch.

10:50.867 --> 10:54.218
Crunchy, instead of creamy
was a great idea.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.612
Right, It's more
like a taffy apple

10:56.699 --> 10:59.615
the way God
intended you to eat apples.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.704
Did his grandma kick him
out of the house again?

11:01.791 --> 11:03.401
Yeah, but don't worry,
the two of 'em will be gone

11:03.488 --> 11:05.621
by first thing tomorrow morning.

11:05.708 --> 11:08.015
- "Two of them?"
- Yeah, he picked up some gal.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.757
You know, I think I prefer the
McIntosh to the Granny Smith.

11:10.844 --> 11:13.107
Wait, Carl is downstairs
with a strange woman

11:13.194 --> 11:14.369
sleeping on our couch?

11:14.456 --> 11:15.762
Well, they're probably not
sleeping yet.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.198
She was pretty wired
on something.

11:17.285 --> 11:19.679
Still got her teeth,
so I doubt it's meth.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.768
Wait, you got to get
'em out of here.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.508
I mean, tell him
to go to a hotel.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.554
He's my best friend.
I can't turn him away.

11:25.641 --> 11:27.034
Well, why can't
they go to her place?

11:27.121 --> 11:30.037
I don't know, eviction
notice or jealous husband.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.734
She was very cagey about it.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.563
Have you eaten
two slices or just one?

11:34.650 --> 11:36.652
I am really not
comfortable with this.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.001
You won't even
know she's here.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.524
Unless she's that screamer
with Tourette's

11:39.611 --> 11:41.744
he was telling me
about yesterday.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.791
- You ready to make a baby?
- No, I'm..

11:44.878 --> 11:47.402
I'm not gonna have sex with you
with a strange woman downstairs.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.491
I do it every night with
your mom and your sister.

11:49.578 --> 11:52.363
I just pretend we're astronauts,
and we landed on a weird planet.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.672
Sorry. I thought
I smelled weed up here.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.153
End of the hall.
Ask for Victoria.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.548
She better not eat
all of our apples.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.769
[instrumental music]

12:10.773 --> 12:12.819
Thanks for letting me
crash at your place, man.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.211
Molly still mad at me?

12:14.298 --> 12:16.344
Yeah, but after
two days of no coffee

12:16.431 --> 12:18.433
she pretty much hates everybody.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.695
So when she told me
to get the hell out

12:19.782 --> 12:21.305
that was just
caffeine withdrawal?

12:21.392 --> 12:23.438
No, that was a woman really
wanting you out of her home.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.440
Mm.

12:25.527 --> 12:28.051
Why don't you just go back to
your grandma's and apologize?

12:28.138 --> 12:30.053
Me? Apologize to her?

12:30.140 --> 12:32.795
- For what, livin' my life?
- No, for bringing home whores.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.408
Hey, none of them
were actual whores.

12:37.495 --> 12:40.629
Although one of 'em
did steal my nickel jar.

12:40.716 --> 12:41.978
Well, you can't stay
at our house.

12:42.065 --> 12:45.025
Well, fine. I got plenty
of places I can go.

12:45.112 --> 12:48.158
Hey, Samuel, my man.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.726
I live in an efficiency
apartment with five roommates.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.554
Three of us share
a pull-out couch

12:52.641 --> 12:55.470
two sleep on a yoga mat
and one sleeps in the bathtub.

12:58.212 --> 13:01.302
So, under the kitchen
table is up for grabs?

13:01.389 --> 13:03.957
If we had a kitchen table, we
could bring in another renter.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.962
Damn, that man needs
to get his own place.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.356
[instrumental music]

13:19.494 --> 13:22.062
Oh, man! Spiteful old lady
changed the locks.

13:23.759 --> 13:26.327
Grandma, don't make me
break a window.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.546
If you break a window,
I'm gonna break off your arm

13:28.633 --> 13:30.853
and beat you to death with it.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.463
Quit fooling around
and let me in.

13:32.550 --> 13:35.205
Not by the hairs of
my chinny-chin-chin.

13:35.292 --> 13:36.816
Come on, grandma,
you made your point

13:36.903 --> 13:39.035
but I got no place
else to go tonight.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.081
Alright.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.996
But if you got
some Ukrainian jezebel

13:43.083 --> 13:45.825
hidin' in the bushes,
you two can hop on a dogsled

13:45.912 --> 13:48.349
and mush your butts
back to Moscow.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.874
What's all this?

13:51.961 --> 13:54.398
Those are your shoes,
those are your books

13:54.485 --> 13:57.097
and the square thing
behind you is the door.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.231
Alright, grandma,
you made your point.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.711
No more overnight guests.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.931
This ain't just about
your catting around.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.150
Although that Russian
girl usin' my toothbrush

14:07.237 --> 14:09.761
was the tramp that broke
this camel's back.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.374
Come on, help me
unpack this stuff.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.376
I'm not givin' in
on this, Carlton.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.378
It's time for
you to get your own place

14:17.465 --> 14:20.033
and stand on your own two feet.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.122
What?

14:22.209 --> 14:26.300
I can't leave you by yourself.
You're a fragile old woman.

14:26.387 --> 14:29.520
"Fragile?" Who do you think
lugged them 50-pound boxes

14:29.607 --> 14:32.610
down a flight of
stairs like a damn mule?

14:32.697 --> 14:34.351
It's dangerous,
you living alone.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.179
Like that time you got
heat exhaustion mowin' the lawn.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.920
Told you I was fine.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.574
You was fine, because
I was there to spray you down

14:39.661 --> 14:41.793
with the garden hose.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.752
I was nappin', fool.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.623
I woke up thinkin'
I was back in Selma

14:45.710 --> 14:47.712
gettin' fire-hosed
by the police.

14:49.323 --> 14:50.672
Alright, alright,
is this about me

14:50.759 --> 14:52.021
contributin' more
around the house?

14:52.108 --> 14:53.588
Because if I'm gonna
pay you to do my laundry

14:53.675 --> 14:55.546
you're gonna have to step up
the fluff and fold.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.635
Carlton, sit down.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.032
I ain't been doin'
you any favors

15:03.119 --> 15:05.556
by mollycoddlin'
and babyin' you.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.167
You a full grown man

15:07.254 --> 15:10.735
and you need to start
actin' like one.

15:10.822 --> 15:13.521
- Why are you doin' this?
- 'Cause I love you.

15:13.608 --> 15:17.438
And it's time
for you to grow up.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.092
I've lived in this house
my whole life and..

15:19.179 --> 15:20.441
...and now you're
just gonna kick me out?

15:20.528 --> 15:23.661
Don't make this
any harder than it is.

15:23.748 --> 15:26.142
When your mama left
you here to live with me

15:26.229 --> 15:29.058
I promised her I would
take good care of you.

15:29.145 --> 15:31.365
And you did. Grandma,
you gave me everything.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.584
You made me stay in school,
you kept me out of trouble.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.064
I don't know what I
would've done without you.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.284
Well, it's time
for you to find out.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.808
And I'm not kickin'
you out of my life

15:39.895 --> 15:41.766
I'm just throwin'
you out of my house.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.162
Well, can I just
stay here tonight

15:46.249 --> 15:47.598
until I figure out
what I'm gonna do?

15:47.685 --> 15:49.818
No, if I don't stay strong now

15:49.905 --> 15:52.038
I might never do it.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.953
Besides, Brother Heywood's
upstairs

15:54.040 --> 15:55.955
and his refractory time
is almost over.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.439
Grab yourself somethin' to
drink and let yourself out.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.315
I love you, Carlton.

16:09.925 --> 16:12.797
Love you, too.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.669
My whole life in six boxes.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.932
There's eight more up here,
but you're carryin' those down

16:17.019 --> 16:18.673
your damn self.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.243
[instrumental music]

16:31.251 --> 16:32.730
Here's a good one,
studio apartment

16:32.817 --> 16:34.776
utilities included,
small pet allowed.

16:34.863 --> 16:38.258
You could get that
ferret you always wanted.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.651
Studio? No, man, I need
at least a two-bedroom.

16:40.738 --> 16:41.696
I've got to have a home office.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.785
Why do you need an office?

16:43.872 --> 16:45.656
I might write a book someday.

16:45.743 --> 16:49.138
And I need someplace
to put my globe.

16:49.225 --> 16:51.401
God, it's startin' to get cold
in here. You guys cold?

16:51.488 --> 16:53.577
We already turned
the heat up for you, Carl.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.405
Yeah, but that was before
I took off my shoes.

16:55.492 --> 16:58.495
Now my tootsies are
gettin' a little chilly.

16:58.582 --> 16:59.757
- Mike?
- Here we go.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.977
A large one-bedroom
in Wrigleyville.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.761
Hey, you could
walk to ball games.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.459
I don't know, I don't
want to live on a pile

17:05.546 --> 17:07.113
of empty cups and peanut shells.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.593
Bad enough ridin' around
in the squad car with you.

17:11.987 --> 17:14.033
Ha! 32 minutes. Hand it over.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.425
We're not that place.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.906
That place should
be every place.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.516
He ordered a pizza?

17:19.603 --> 17:22.389
Smells like sausage,
onion, and green pepper.

17:22.476 --> 17:25.914
I swear I can smell
the extra cheese.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.524
Y-you know what?
It's nice outside.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.613
I-I'm just gonna eat
this on the porch.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.967
Should we cut up an apple?

17:36.055 --> 17:39.058
You do it. I can't be trusted
with a knife right now.

17:40.537 --> 17:41.886

17:46.021 --> 17:47.544
