00:12.012 --> 00:13.930
<i>Previously on </i>Star Trek: Discovery:

00:14.014 --> 00:15.557
<i>We are in a parallel universe.</i>

00:15.640 --> 00:18.393
We're not the first from our universe
to find ourselves here.

00:18.476 --> 00:22.105
<i>U.S.S. Defiant.</i> If we find out how it did
make it over, could be our way home.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.399
What are you hiding?

00:26.568 --> 00:31.072
I have the human's face,
but inside I remain Voq, son of none.

00:31.322 --> 00:32.866
<i>Stamets is inside the network.</i>

00:34.492 --> 00:36.494
We need to put the network inside him.

00:37.495 --> 00:40.582
Hello, Paul. I so hoped
you would find your way.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.208
He can't sustain this level of exertion.

00:42.292 --> 00:45.503
If we disengage him from the network now,
we will lose him altogether.

00:46.671 --> 00:47.714
I'm presumed dead.

00:47.797 --> 00:50.091
And you're a fugitive,
wanted for my murder.

00:50.175 --> 00:53.303
You attempted a coup against the emperor.
It's believed you escaped.

00:58.516 --> 01:02.937
Captain Michael Burnham.
Don't you bow before your emperor?

01:19.412 --> 01:23.124
<i>Course confirmed</i>
<i>to Imperial Flagship </i>I.S.S. Charon.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.459
<i>Classified coordinates.</i>

01:24.542 --> 01:27.295
<i>Distance, 27 million kilometers.</i>

01:29.339 --> 01:33.384
<i>Engaging engines at warp factor one.</i>
<i>Autopilot activated.</i>

01:33.760 --> 01:37.013
I received a transmission
from Commander Saru before we departed.

01:38.056 --> 01:41.184
He managed to decrypt the <i>Defiant</i> data
that we smuggled off of the <i>Shenzhou.</i>

01:41.267 --> 01:42.769
The file has been redacted.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.480
But there's some data on how the<i> Defiant</i>
crossed into this universe.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.607
A phenomenon called "interphasic space."

01:47.690 --> 01:50.443
But where that space is,
the exact coordinates,

01:50.527 --> 01:51.694
struck from the record.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.280
Well, we just have to hunt down
the original report.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.325
If the archive's anywhere,
it'll be in the Imperial Palace,

01:57.408 --> 02:00.370
which is fortunately
where we've been summoned.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.249
Some would see that glass as half full.

02:10.338 --> 02:13.133
I synthesized a custom analgesic
to numb your nerve receptors,

02:13.216 --> 02:14.843
-as you requested.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.346
-Should help with the agonizers.
-Much appreciated.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.851
Listen. You'll get the data we need
on the <i>Defiant,</i>

02:22.934 --> 02:26.312
and you'll get us out of there.
I know you will.

02:30.692 --> 02:34.654
Burnham, I need you. You need you.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.447
What are you afraid of?

02:41.077 --> 02:43.580
-Georgiou.
-You mean Emperor Georgiou.

02:45.331 --> 02:48.543
Logic tells me she's not the woman
that I betrayed.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.882
But this feels like a reckoning.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.467
Your Georgiou is dead.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.387
She's a ghost.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.682
Haven't you ever been afraid of a ghost?

03:03.433 --> 03:04.976
<i>Warp drive disengaged.</i>

03:05.059 --> 03:07.854
<i>Imperial Palace secure perimeter detected.</i>

03:08.771 --> 03:11.274
I.S.S. Shenzhou
<i>shuttlecraft identity confirmed.</i>

03:11.357 --> 03:13.318
<i>You are cleared to approach the </i>Charon.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.420
<i>You said there had been improvement</i>
<i>in his condition.</i>

04:55.503 --> 04:57.297
Since restarting spore therapy,

04:57.380 --> 05:01.050
Lieutenant Stamets' neural activity
has increased across all metrics.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.387
Glucose and oxygen consumption
is up significantly, beta and infra-low waves
are off the curve, and...

05:08.182 --> 05:12.145
It's subjective, but he does look better.
Look at his skin, it's so dewy.

05:13.479 --> 05:18.776
I admire your optimism,
but let us call this what it is... a coma.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.779
We began this treatment to reconnect him
with his consciousness.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.949
Something is going on in that head.
We just need to let it happen.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.202
It'll need to happen far more quickly
if he is to help us get home.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.331
Not much came from the <i>Defiant</i> data.

05:31.873 --> 05:35.335
If the captain and Burnham cannot unearth
the coordinates that tell us

05:35.418 --> 05:39.213
where the <i>Defiant</i> crossed over,
our spore drive remains our only way home.

05:39.297 --> 05:42.967
And it remains inoperable
while Lieutenant Stamets is in that state.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.804
<i>Commander Saru,</i>
<i>medical emergency. Report to sickbay.</i>

05:46.888 --> 05:47.805
Acknowledged.

05:49.098 --> 05:49.932
Forge ahead.

05:51.017 --> 05:51.893
Fix him.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.113
Are you in there, Lieutenant?

06:06.407 --> 06:07.825
Are you in there

06:09.786 --> 06:11.037
What is this?

06:11.746 --> 06:12.705
Am I dead?

06:13.706 --> 06:15.041
Is this the afterlife?

06:15.124 --> 06:18.628
Are you some sort of narcissistic Virgil,
leading me to judgment?

06:19.295 --> 06:22.423
Yes, Paul.
You've been wrong about everything.

06:22.924 --> 06:26.219
There is a God,
and she's very, very mad at you right now.

06:29.430 --> 06:33.017
I totally had you for a second there.
You can't deny it.

06:33.101 --> 06:37.980
You should've seen your face.
I mean, our face. Hoo!

06:38.064 --> 06:39.357
That was classic.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.401
So, there is no God?

06:42.777 --> 06:46.239
Well, you're still alive,
so, technically, who knows?

06:46.322 --> 06:49.909
But if I'm not dead, who are you?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.703
You. In my universe.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.706
Nice to meet you.

07:00.878 --> 07:04.757
-Wait. This is my ship.
-No, you're still in the mycelial network.

07:04.841 --> 07:08.427
But it knows what's familiar to you
and it's trying to make you feel at home.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.472
Your comatose physical self
is still onboard the real <i>Discovery,</i>

07:11.556 --> 07:13.724
but your neural energy
has taken a little detour.

07:13.808 --> 07:18.104
-Like you, I'm an astromycologist.

07:18.187 --> 07:21.566
I was conducting experiments in my lab
on the emperor's palace ship.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.861
There was an accident,
and my mind ended up here, too.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.113
It seems we share parallel fates.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.656
From what I can tell,

07:28.739 --> 07:32.160
my physical form is also
in a catatonic state on my vessel.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.953
I was losing hope,

07:34.036 --> 07:36.998
until you navigated the mycelial highway
for the first time.

07:37.081 --> 07:41.085
I tracked your comings and goings.
I've been trying to make contact,

07:41.169 --> 07:44.464
but I haven't been able to transmit
more than glimpses.

07:44.547 --> 07:48.384
-Images of my universe.
-That explains what I've been seeing.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.637
<i>Visions of a palace, Tilly as a captain.</i>

07:52.430 --> 07:56.058
I thought I was going insane,
but it was just you reaching out.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.228
-That's where you come in.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.773
-You're the navigator. Navigate us out.
-Let's get to my lab.

08:03.649 --> 08:04.609
Maybe it's there.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.738
There's something wrong
inside the network, corrupted.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.574
Don't get swept up in it.
I did once, and was lost for days.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.161
Engineering is that way.

08:21.876 --> 08:22.710
Let's go.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.714
The enemy is here.

08:28.925 --> 08:29.967
It's over there.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.477
Welcome to our way out.

08:50.238 --> 08:53.324
<i>Lords of the Empire,</i>
<i>privileged guests...</i>

08:54.033 --> 08:58.496
all hail Her Most Imperial Majesty,
Mother of the Fatherland,

08:58.579 --> 09:03.709
Overlord of Vulcan, Dominus of Qo'noS,
Regina Andor...

09:03.793 --> 09:09.507
All hail the Emperor Philippa Georgiou
Augustus Iaponius Centarius.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.635
All hail the emperor.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.684
Emperor, I present to you...

09:20.101 --> 09:23.396
Captain Michael Burnham
of the Imperial Starship <i>Shenzhou.</i>

09:26.691 --> 09:27.900
Captain Burnham.

09:28.609 --> 09:32.196
A face I thought I'd never see again
in the flesh.

09:32.947 --> 09:33.781
Choose one.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.416
You should know what you're looking for
in a Kelpien.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.465
That one.

09:53.009 --> 09:53.926
Move.

09:57.346 --> 10:01.100
-Captain Gabriel Lorca.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.604
Delivered to the emperor's justice.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.398
And long overdue.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.825
You think I'm gonna bow to you?

10:19.201 --> 10:20.453
I don't bow.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.880
Your life will be long, Gabriel.

10:31.422 --> 10:36.177
And every single moment of it
will be spent in our agonizers.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.723
A fair price to pay
for your vaulting ambition.

10:40.806 --> 10:44.185
Take him to Brig C.
Only the finest for our new guest.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.145
Let's go.

11:02.745 --> 11:06.457
You could have died hunting that traitor
across the universe.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.210
I...

11:10.753 --> 11:14.590
am so happy you didn't.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.182
Let her rest a bit,
and have her at my residence by dinner.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.600
Yes, Emperor.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.269
There is so much to discuss.

11:28.437 --> 11:31.524
Everything will be the way it was.

11:32.942 --> 11:33.943
Dear daughter.

11:39.990 --> 11:44.120
Filthy humans! Let me die!

11:44.203 --> 11:48.040
I don't know what else to do with him.
He's damaged a biobed and scanning array.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.667
-Well, sedate him.
-I have.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.002
I will kill you all in T'Kuvma's name!
-Yes, that's Klingon.

11:56.090 --> 12:00.636
Burnham said he claimed to be a Klingon.
But how could that be possible?

12:00.719 --> 12:04.223
His genome matches the one we have
for Lieutenant Ash Tyler in our database.

12:04.306 --> 12:06.559
His brainwave patterns, however,
are highly irregular.

12:06.642 --> 12:10.020
Unless someone can tell me
how they put a Klingon inside his body,

12:10.104 --> 12:13.107
-I don't know how we can treat him.
Commander...

12:14.400 --> 12:15.651
Commander...

12:19.530 --> 12:22.158
Burnham. Is she all right?

12:22.867 --> 12:24.368
-She's fine.
Good.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.078
Saru.

12:28.080 --> 12:28.998
Help me.

12:29.999 --> 12:30.833
Please.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.674
-Dose him again. Now, please.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.404
The food is delicious, as always.

13:00.654 --> 13:03.782
No one prepares Kelpien
like the Imperial chef.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.330
Here. Have my ganglia.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.043
You deserve a treat.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.265
You're too generous.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.684
Why would you leave me, then?

13:32.811 --> 13:33.896
I gave you everything.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.564
Best education.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.858
Riches beyond imagination.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.320
-Even your own ship.
-I earned my command on the <i>Shenzhou.</i>

13:41.403 --> 13:44.073
You were hesitant to use it
back at Harlak.

13:45.866 --> 13:49.662
Those rebels could have escaped.
I had to dispatch them myself.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.248
-I had it under control.
-You've grown soft.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.541
And you've grown cruel.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.502
If you missed me, say it.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.213
-Otherwise, let me be.
-I thought you were dead.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.343
Lorca's men are everywhere,
even here aboard this ship.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.137
If you had known I was alive,
they would have known, too.

14:07.221 --> 14:10.224
It would have been impossible
to ambush him the way that I did.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.603
Never could tell
when you were lying to me.

14:16.730 --> 14:17.731
Fortunately...

14:19.275 --> 14:20.860
this time, I know.

14:22.319 --> 14:27.658
You always tried to outsmart me, Michael.
Even as a child. Why?

14:27.741 --> 14:32.162
Was it the loss of your parents?
My attention to the Empire?

14:32.246 --> 14:34.123
Or were you just built that way?

14:35.291 --> 14:38.878
Why were you never satisfied?

14:41.297 --> 14:44.925
I knew you had become Lorca's collaborator

14:45.759 --> 14:51.056
and you were conspiring to kill me
and take my throne.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.730
Why did the two of you come back here?

14:58.063 --> 15:00.482
Please, Philippa.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.401
It's "Philippa" now?

15:03.527 --> 15:06.572
Not so long ago, it was "Mother."

15:11.493 --> 15:12.328
Guards!

15:14.038 --> 15:16.707
Take her to the throne room.
Gather my council.

15:17.207 --> 15:21.170
She is to be executed by my own hand
for treason.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.091
To map an exit from the network,

15:26.175 --> 15:28.928
it's helpful to know
exactly where <i>Discovery </i>entered,

15:29.011 --> 15:30.554
as a way to get our bearings.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.851
And once I know that,
we can hunt for the best path out.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.107
-Huh.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.778
The coordinates of our final jump
aren't here.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.279
Tell me why you're not useless.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.073
Tell me why you can't stop
clawing your arm.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.407
It's nothing.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.911
It's nice to know I'm a terrible liar
in every universe.

15:56.372 --> 16:00.584
Is that... <i>Armillaria ostoyae?</i>

16:01.627 --> 16:04.588
It's the network. It's taking me over.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.466
-I've been here too long.
Paul.

16:12.012 --> 16:12.888
Hugh?

16:19.019 --> 16:22.398
He was here.
That must mean he's trapped, too.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.985
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
If you don't focus on the task at hand,

16:26.068 --> 16:28.612
you'll get lost and we'll never escape.
Stop!

16:30.990 --> 16:32.658
Captain Michael Burnham.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.077
We have sentenced you to death

16:35.160 --> 16:37.788
for crimes committed
against the Terran throne.

16:38.455 --> 16:42.209
Do you have any last words
before we collect our retribution?

16:46.922 --> 16:49.717
At least you are showing some steel.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.345
I do love you, Michael.

16:53.929 --> 16:57.224
I would never grant anyone else
in the Empire

16:57.307 --> 16:59.727
the mercy of a quick death.

17:00.102 --> 17:04.273
You don't love me. You don't love me
because you don't know me.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.278
Before today, you and I have never met.

17:10.779 --> 17:14.241
I am Michael Burnham,
but I am not your Michael Burnham.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.744
I'm from another universe.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.164
I have proof.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.417
It's in my pocket.

17:26.336 --> 17:29.548
Lord Eling, retrieve this proof.

17:29.673 --> 17:30.507
Yes, Emperor.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.809
That piece of metal contains
the quantum variance from my world.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.354
It's subtle, but it's there.
There's absolutely no way to fake it.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.902
It belonged to my captain.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.196
It belonged to you.

17:56.658 --> 18:00.245
Our bond, it seems,
is strong enough to cross universes.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.960
What a quaint concept.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.506
Parallel universes.

18:21.308 --> 18:24.561
-Yes, Emperor.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.438
Good. Clean this up.

18:26.522 --> 18:30.275
Never speak a word of it to anyone,
and I'll make you governor of Andor.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.485
Yes, Emperor.

18:34.988 --> 18:38.951
This... is from the United Federation
of Planets.

18:42.037 --> 18:45.165
And apparently... so are you.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.015
You must want something.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.104
Lieutenant Tyler is in distress.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.107
He thinks he is a Klingon.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.778
Then he has awoken.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.781
I do not know
what your people had planned for him,

19:17.865 --> 19:19.491
but this cannot have been it.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.620
-You must be able to help him.
-There is nothing to help.

19:29.459 --> 19:34.339
Beneath that man's inferior carriage
is a devoted warrior

19:34.423 --> 19:39.136
who has sacrificed everything,
and T'Kuvma's chosen successor.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.598
He will light the way for his race.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.642
He will win this war.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.769
I guess you didn't hear the news.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.398
The <i>Discovery</i> was thrown
into a parallel universe.

19:51.940 --> 19:56.069
Here, the war is over, and you lost.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.946
-Lies.
-I wish they were.

19:58.989 --> 20:05.245
But the war and all your devious designs
mean nothing now.

20:05.329 --> 20:09.625
All that remains is the suffering
of an individual I suspect you care for.

20:10.417 --> 20:15.130
I do not know where your Voq ends
and our Tyler begins,

20:15.464 --> 20:17.466
but they're both in jeopardy.

20:18.342 --> 20:22.262
The question is, will you ease their pain?

20:22.930 --> 20:27.893
The one you call Tyler was captured
in battle at the Binary Stars.

20:28.518 --> 20:32.773
We harvested his DNA,
reconstructed his consciousness,

20:32.856 --> 20:34.358
and rebuilt his memory.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.362
We modified Voq into a shell
that appears human.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.530
We grafted his psyche into Tyler's.

20:40.614 --> 20:47.287
And in so doing, Voq has given his body
and soul for our ideology.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.708
If he suffers for that choice, so be it.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.921
He accepted that suffering
in order to best the enemy.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.715
That is what it means to be a soldier.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.219
That is war.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.901
<i>Hugh?</i>

21:20.070 --> 21:20.904
Hugh?

22:25.427 --> 22:26.303
Hi.

22:27.512 --> 22:28.847
I wasn't sure if you'd come home.

22:28.930 --> 22:34.102
All the other times I tried
to lure you from work with dinner, wine...

22:34.186 --> 22:36.313
Are you caught in the network, too?

22:37.564 --> 22:38.607
No.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.485
I'm gone.

22:42.819 --> 22:43.653
"Gone"?

22:47.532 --> 22:48.784
You don't know, do you?

22:49.659 --> 22:51.036
Paul, I'm so sorry.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.748
But I died.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.088
<i>You have no reason</i>
<i>to hold my captain.</i>

23:01.171 --> 23:03.757
He shouldn't have to suffer
for your Lorca's crimes.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.009
Your captain may not be comfortable
where he is,

23:06.093 --> 23:08.762
but I am... for now.

23:08.845 --> 23:12.933
My ship and crew are here by accident.
All we want is to return to our universe.

23:13.016 --> 23:17.646
-But we need your help to do that.
-You're interlopers from an alien army.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.857
What reason from any universe
would I have to help you?

23:20.941 --> 23:22.359
Because you care for Burnham.

23:22.859 --> 23:25.070
Despite her betrayal,
you said you loved her.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.367
Your people are dangerous.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.953
The Federation.

23:33.620 --> 23:37.374
I know it well from the <i>Defiant's</i> files.

23:37.457 --> 23:40.794
There is a reason why they're classified.

23:41.336 --> 23:45.549
"Equality, freedom, cooperation."

23:45.632 --> 23:48.593
Cornerstones for successful cultures.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.304
Delusions that Terrans shed millennia ago.

23:51.388 --> 23:55.142
Destructive ideals that fuel rebellions.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.769
And I will not let you infect us again.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.357
We need access to the redacted information
about the <i>Defiant.</i>

24:02.440 --> 24:04.317
We believe it'll help us get back.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.987
Share it and you have my word
you'll never hear from us again.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.905
Those documents will not help you.

24:08.989 --> 24:12.284
The <i>Defiant</i> crossed here
through interphasic space,

24:12.367 --> 24:15.287
which not only resulted
in a temporal anomaly,

24:15.370 --> 24:19.833
but also had devastating cognitive effects
on every crew member.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.210
They went insane.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.880
They tore each other apart.

24:26.089 --> 24:30.844
I'm surprised the same thing
didn't happen to your crew.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.847
-We arrived here a different way.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.182
An engine malfunction.

24:35.265 --> 24:39.186
Warp engines do not breach the barriers
between universes.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.772
Tell me what powers your ship.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.652
Our ship jumped here with
its displacement-activated sporehub drive.

24:48.361 --> 24:50.363
I would like to see this technology.

24:51.323 --> 24:56.077
Let's make an exchange:
your engine schematics for your freedom.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.916
If I agree,
how do I know you'll let us go?

25:00.999 --> 25:03.919
-Entirely.

25:04.002 --> 25:07.047
Then you have no reason
to believe I am not as well.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.848
Tyler broke free of his restraints.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.895
-This is what he did.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.531
He is too violent for sickbay.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.700
None of our doctors can help him.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.829
I will ask you one final time.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.414
Will you?

25:43.250 --> 25:44.209
No.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.211
Energize.

25:50.715 --> 25:53.176
You have sealed this being's hellish fate.

25:55.136 --> 25:56.805
Human versus Klingon in one body.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.560
-That is war.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.357
It can be undone.

26:11.444 --> 26:13.905
But only my hands can tend to him.

26:27.752 --> 26:28.586
Captain.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.339
-I'll take it from here.
Aye, Captain.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.261
Tell me, Gabriel,
where have you been hiding

26:36.344 --> 26:38.096
since the <i>Buran</i> was blown to bits?

26:38.179 --> 26:41.308
-With friends.

26:41.391 --> 26:44.561
The emperor rounded up your loyalists
from every corner of the Empire.

26:45.061 --> 26:47.480
Had to fill the aft hangar bay
with agonizer booths

26:47.564 --> 26:48.898
just to accommodate them all.

26:48.982 --> 26:51.776
Yet here we are, just the two of us.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.738
Feels like it's getting personal.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.156
It is personal.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.241
She was my sister.

27:03.913 --> 27:07.959
This is DNA from a Comtaxan parasite
on Tonnata VII.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.711
Doesn't mix well with ours.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.088
Admit what you did.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.299
Or what?

27:24.893 --> 27:25.727
Gabriel?

27:26.186 --> 27:29.898
-You're alive. I thought they were lying.
-Chin up, soldier.

27:32.108 --> 27:34.444
They kept asking us all
if you were really dead,

27:34.527 --> 27:35.445
and I said no.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.823
I said no because I wanted to believe.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.498
-My sister.
-Ah. There were so many women.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.500
It's good to be the captain.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.959
Say her name.

27:50.627 --> 27:54.089
-Say her name so I can spare your friend.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.924
Just-- Just say it.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.219
Please.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.641
Leave him out of this.
It's between you and me.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.928
When I see you, I do not see the human.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.724
I see the warrior...

28:46.349 --> 28:48.393
who laid down all for his people.

28:48.935 --> 28:51.646
Kahless, give me light.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.276
Father, give me wisdom.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.028
Mother, give me drink.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.249
Brother, give me strength.

29:11.624 --> 29:14.627
Sister, give me family.

29:38.318 --> 29:39.611
I saw you die.

29:41.404 --> 29:43.406
I watched Tyler kill you.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.495
<i>I held your body in my arms.</i>

29:49.412 --> 29:50.872
<i>I thought it was a dream.</i>

29:51.414 --> 29:52.457
I wish it were.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.130
I remember your arms around me.

30:01.883 --> 30:04.886
-You made me feel safe. Always did.
Stamets, get out of there!

30:04.969 --> 30:06.346
This place is quicksand.

30:06.429 --> 30:09.891
-If we don't leave, we die.
-Computer, play Kasseelian opera.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.435
The aria he loves. The one I hate.

30:14.187 --> 30:17.106
-This won't change anything.
-I don't want it to change.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.484
I want it to be the way it was.

30:20.276 --> 30:22.111
Please, let it be the way it was.

30:31.287 --> 30:34.874
-This is perfect.
-This was my favorite time with you.

30:36.417 --> 30:39.087
Did you know I loved you?
I don't think I told you enough.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.213
You showed me...

30:41.506 --> 30:42.507
<i>all the time.</i>

30:43.675 --> 30:45.009
Tell me about your day.

30:47.053 --> 30:51.641
It was awful. My partner is dead.
My life's work has been a waste.

30:52.058 --> 30:55.937
What I knew to be beautiful is hostile,
and the mycelial network is hell.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.773
No, Paul. You were right.

30:59.774 --> 31:00.775
The network is a gift.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.736
It's the thread
that weaves life through space.

31:05.446 --> 31:07.782
-But it is in danger.
-Yeah, we're in danger.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.619
It's eating me alive. Well, the other me.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.955
Oh, the other you deserves it.

31:14.372 --> 31:17.375
That Stamets exploited the network
for his own gain.

31:18.418 --> 31:22.380
He's the one who corrupted it.
I needed you to follow me to warn you.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.216
The damage is spreading.

31:25.300 --> 31:29.137
Eventually, everything everywhere
will be exterminated.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.515
You have to save us by saving the network.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.310
How? I can't even find my way out.

31:36.978 --> 31:39.772
You're in a coma on the <i>Discovery.</i>

31:40.273 --> 31:43.026
And the simplest way back
is just to open your eyes.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.320
I don't want to say goodbye.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.363
It's never goodbye.

31:48.948 --> 31:50.909
Isn't that what you've been trying
to teach us?

31:50.992 --> 31:53.077
Nothing in here is ever truly gone.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.538
I believe in you, Paul.

31:57.206 --> 31:58.333
I love you.

32:08.718 --> 32:12.305
Follow the music, Paul.
Look for the clearing in the forest.

32:13.389 --> 32:14.349
Open your eyes.

32:17.769 --> 32:18.645
I'm back.

32:24.067 --> 32:24.984
He did it.

32:28.655 --> 32:29.739
He did it.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.454
-Oh, my...

32:36.537 --> 32:39.374
Lieutenant, you're back. He's back!

32:39.916 --> 32:43.127
And he's leaving. Lieutenant,
I don't think this is a good idea.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.590
-Some things have happened.
-I know about Hugh.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.884
But I need you to come with me now.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.392
It's too late.

32:59.185 --> 33:01.479
The sickness has already spread
to our supply.

33:04.023 --> 33:07.819
<i>Please, do not take offense,</i>
<i>but I would feel better if Captain Lorca</i>

33:07.902 --> 33:10.279
<i>were the one making this request</i>
<i>for a rendezvous.</i>

33:10.363 --> 33:12.949
Trust me, so would I, but he's locked up.

33:13.032 --> 33:16.452
-His safety depends upon your arrival.
-<i>Acknowledged.</i>

33:16.536 --> 33:18.746
I'm sending coordinates
to the emperor's ship.

33:20.206 --> 33:24.877
-We'll see you soon.
-They're Federation through and through.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.380
They would never abandon you
and your captain.

33:28.047 --> 33:30.383
Rules to live by.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.719
<i>-Rules to die by.</i>

33:32.802 --> 33:36.180
My sister loved you.
Say her name and beg for forgiveness.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.061
<i>I need to see my captain.</i>

33:42.854 --> 33:45.356
He won't survive agonizers much longer.
He's suffering.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.943
Let him. If your bond to me
crosses universes,

33:49.027 --> 33:50.737
then so does his treachery.

33:50.820 --> 33:53.489
The Lorca I knew was my right hand.

33:53.573 --> 33:57.410
I trusted him
with the Empire's most sensitive missions.

33:57.827 --> 34:01.080
I... trusted him with you.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.331
I don't understand.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.668
When I adopted you, you gained a mother.

34:05.752 --> 34:09.172
But despite my constant guidance
and affection,

34:09.255 --> 34:11.132
something was still missing.

34:11.799 --> 34:14.093
In Lorca, you saw a father.

34:15.470 --> 34:19.348
Until you grew up, and it became more.

34:21.976 --> 34:24.645
-He groomed you.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.190
He chose you.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.777
I did choose you,
but not for the reasons you think.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.988
He told you
that destiny brought you together.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.656
Different universe,

34:35.740 --> 34:39.619
yet somehow the same people had a way
to find each other.

34:39.702 --> 34:43.206
It's the strongest argument I've ever seen
for the existence of destiny.

34:43.581 --> 34:47.710
He said he'd cross time and space itself
to take what was rightfully his.

34:49.504 --> 34:53.091
Apparently the 133 jumps we made
filled in the gaps.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.093
An extraordinarily fortunate coincidence.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.849
You're sensitive to light.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.103
Only compared to a human
from your universe.

35:05.186 --> 35:09.565
It's the singular biological difference
between our two races.

35:20.326 --> 35:23.079
Don't die on me, you depraved bastard.

35:28.084 --> 35:33.506
He needed me to get onto this ship.
You wouldn't have let him on otherwise.

35:33.589 --> 35:35.967
I need you to live,
or I'm as good as dead.

35:36.884 --> 35:37.718
You're right.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.141
He needed me to get to you.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.775
None of this was an accident.

35:52.859 --> 35:55.194
My so-called captain's
not from my universe.

35:56.529 --> 35:57.530
He's from yours.

35:58.489 --> 35:59.323
Ava.

36:00.741 --> 36:01.909
Her name was Ava.

36:04.704 --> 36:07.582
And I liked her. But you know how it is.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.083
Somebody better came along.
