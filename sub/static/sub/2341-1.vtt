04:42.140 --> 04:44.174
Wait! Come back!

04:44.673 --> 04:45.973
Please!

04:47.406 --> 04:49.193
Please help me!

06:25.867 --> 06:27.234
Help me!

07:41.724 --> 07:44.362
- We should help him.
- Not until we know what's going on.

07:44.562 --> 07:46.200
Maybe he has access.

07:50.694 --> 07:53.712
There's a storm out there.
We don't know what's going on.

07:54.562 --> 07:56.161
He could be dangerous.

07:56.361 --> 07:58.462
He's not the lot of us.
You don't know him.

07:58.662 --> 08:00.061
We know nothing about him.

08:00.261 --> 08:03.128
- Well, he has to eat...
- Yes, he can.

08:03.328 --> 08:06.060
He'll die if we
don't get him out of there.

08:06.260 --> 08:08.526
Not really my main
concern at the moment.

08:08.726 --> 08:10.326
He has no food.
He has no water.

08:10.526 --> 08:12.194
He's not one of us.

08:12.394 --> 08:13.560
We have to take care
of us right now.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.060
Wait...

08:16.194 --> 08:17.526
- Drop your weapon.
- No.

08:17.726 --> 08:19.627
- Drop your gun.
- Both of you, please don't.

08:19.827 --> 08:21.492
He's here to kill us. I'm going
to blow your fucking head off.

08:21.692 --> 08:23.493
Drop your gun.

08:23.693 --> 08:25.754
I won't put it down.
You put yours down.

08:26.692 --> 08:28.760
Do it.

08:30.258 --> 08:31.558
Put your gun down.

08:32.793 --> 08:34.126
Tell him to put his gun down.

08:34.326 --> 08:36.706
- Tell him to put his gun down!
- Lukas, please!

08:37.159 --> 08:39.693
Is this your house? Huh?

08:40.193 --> 08:42.092
Whose house is this?

08:42.292 --> 08:44.158
- You killed those people in the pit?
- Fuck you!

08:44.358 --> 08:46.963
You killed those people.
Who are you?

08:51.458 --> 08:53.225
Uh, I don't remember.

08:53.425 --> 08:55.323
That's bullshit.
Who are you?

08:57.490 --> 09:01.524
I woke up in a pit. Yeah, I
don't remember anything before.

09:01.724 --> 09:04.557
She helped me, okay? This woman helped me.
I need to talk to her.

09:04.757 --> 09:05.924
You let him out?

09:06.124 --> 09:07.390
You stupid...

09:07.590 --> 09:09.156
- Hey...
- Easy!

09:09.356 --> 09:11.190
You know me?
Why'd you let me out?

09:11.390 --> 09:13.864
I need...

09:21.356 --> 09:23.417
- Get you fucking hands off me!
- Sorry!

09:24.556 --> 09:26.190
What's wrong with him?

09:26.390 --> 09:28.187
Help me!

09:31.089 --> 09:32.356
Just breathe!

09:32.556 --> 09:33.620
- Get your hands off me!
- What's wrong with him?

09:33.820 --> 09:34.521
Just breathe!

09:34.721 --> 09:36.020
Easy!

09:36.220 --> 09:38.021
- Here, here, here.
- Look at me, you will be okay.

09:38.221 --> 09:39.555
It's water.

09:39.755 --> 09:41.055
Easy now.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.723
Okay. Okay. All right.

09:44.222 --> 09:45.762
What the hell is going on?

09:46.654 --> 09:48.235
You people know each other?

09:50.755 --> 09:52.286
You just need to breathe.

09:52.753 --> 09:54.089
Breathe.

09:55.586 --> 09:58.155
Hey, who are you, man?

09:59.653 --> 10:01.693
I don't remember who I am.

10:07.187 --> 10:09.052
None of us do.

10:14.485 --> 10:16.585
Okay, we have
no phone and no computer.

10:16.785 --> 10:18.925
There's no way to
contact the authorities.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.889
All we have to go on is this.

10:24.386 --> 10:25.584
So we know our names.

10:25.784 --> 10:27.185
I'm Sharon!

10:27.385 --> 10:29.018
I... Michael.

10:29.218 --> 10:30.518
You've met Lukas.

10:31.784 --> 10:33.205
So this must be Nathan.

10:34.617 --> 10:36.652
Nathan?

10:37.151 --> 10:38.451
Nathan?

10:41.484 --> 10:42.987
I'm Nathan.

10:44.484 --> 10:46.216
I don't know my name.

10:46.416 --> 10:48.251
I didn't have ID.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.050
We also have keys.

10:52.384 --> 10:53.784
I own a Nissan.

10:54.283 --> 10:56.351
I have a key.

10:56.850 --> 10:59.984
- You have cars?
- No.

11:00.184 --> 11:03.084
There's no cars. I've looked
around outside. There's nothing.

11:05.149 --> 11:08.015
Can you understand
what she's writing?

11:08.215 --> 11:10.795
She's writing over and over again.
Can you read this?

11:11.649 --> 11:14.514
What language is this?

11:14.714 --> 11:17.414
- She can't understand you.
- Hey, she helped me, okay?

11:17.614 --> 11:19.514
- Do you know me? Why did you help me?
- I've tried this...

11:19.714 --> 11:21.182
Stop trying!
You're freaking her out.

11:21.382 --> 11:23.047
You know me, okay?

11:23.247 --> 11:24.463
You helped me out of the pit. Don't
look at these fucking idiots.

11:24.663 --> 11:27.182
It doesn't matter what you
say to her, she can't understand.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.948
- Hey, shut up!
- She doesn't understand you, okay?

11:30.148 --> 11:33.081
- What, is she deaf?
- No! She's not deaf, all right?

11:33.281 --> 11:35.901
She can hear you. She just
doesn't understand English.

11:36.381 --> 11:38.214
She's mute.

11:38.713 --> 11:41.514
But she acts like she knows us.

11:41.714 --> 11:44.113
We all woke up in this house a
half hour before we found you,

11:44.313 --> 11:46.151
and she was already here.

11:49.647 --> 11:51.684
Anything else?

11:56.179 --> 11:58.714
I'm Catholic, apparently.

11:59.213 --> 12:00.615
And that's it?

12:02.113 --> 12:03.848
Well, you also had a gun.

12:05.345 --> 12:07.979
Yeah, you had a gun, too.

12:08.179 --> 12:10.559
I didn't dig it up out of
a pile of dead people.

12:11.530 --> 12:12.611
We're all in the same boat here.

12:12.811 --> 12:15.279
No! We're not
in the same boat.

12:15.479 --> 12:19.045
We were in the same boat. He was
in the boat with all the corpses!

12:19.245 --> 12:21.080
I don't trust you.

12:22.578 --> 12:24.250
I don't trust you.

12:29.743 --> 12:31.243
I don't trust any of you.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.124
Have you checked the house?

13:28.740 --> 13:30.143
Yes.

13:32.639 --> 13:33.939
We both have this.

13:35.339 --> 13:36.774
Why? What happened?

13:37.273 --> 13:38.775
What happened to us?

13:39.273 --> 13:40.873
I know. What happened?

14:14.337 --> 14:17.307
Hey, where is the girl?

14:18.804 --> 14:20.369
I need to talk to the girl.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.773
Guys, I need to
speak to the girl.

14:30.336 --> 14:32.269
I need you to look
at something for me.

14:32.469 --> 14:34.036
Look at this.

14:34.236 --> 14:36.303
Did you do this?
Did you write this?

14:36.503 --> 14:38.401
Yes. You wrote it. Okay.

14:38.601 --> 14:40.172
What does it mean?

14:42.669 --> 14:46.089
- Hey, guys, come and look at this.
- What... Shit.

15:05.568 --> 15:08.499
Well, we have some ammunition.

15:08.699 --> 15:13.933
Well, I suppose to kill so many
people you need a lot of bullets.

15:21.133 --> 15:22.768
What?

15:24.266 --> 15:25.936
Maybe you're a cop.

15:28.433 --> 15:32.099
I say we take some of these and go
and have a look around outside.

15:32.299 --> 15:35.267
No. We load up and protect
ourselves in here.

15:35.765 --> 15:37.868
We'll go in the morning.

15:40.365 --> 15:41.665
Showers work.

15:46.097 --> 15:48.101
We haven't found
any medical supplies.

15:51.597 --> 15:53.257
You can use peroxide on that.

15:55.331 --> 15:57.432
Or you're looking
at a serious infection.

15:59.530 --> 16:00.830
Need me to help?

16:01.263 --> 16:03.032
I'm okay.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.331
Okay.

16:07.829 --> 16:10.490
There's some clothes in the bedroom.
I'll get you some.

16:13.496 --> 16:15.117
You don't need that anymore.

16:17.228 --> 16:19.488
I prefer to hang on to it,
if you don't mind.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.838
Suit yourself.

16:30.328 --> 16:32.832
I'm okay, thanks.
I'm okay.

16:37.327 --> 16:38.632
I'm okay.

16:42.128 --> 16:44.065
I am not okay.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.329
<i>Who are you?</i>

17:09.825 --> 17:12.031
<i>What's my name?</i>

17:16.526 --> 17:17.997
<i>The 18th.</i>

17:22.492 --> 17:24.165
<i>Remember.</i>

17:35.223 --> 17:37.626
Guys, the girl ran off.

17:40.123 --> 17:41.762
There she is.

17:45.258 --> 17:46.877
Should we follow her?

17:47.290 --> 17:48.859
Shit!

17:50.357 --> 17:53.088
Okay, gun guy,
you know all those weapons.

17:55.356 --> 17:57.223
- Yes?
- Yes.

17:57.423 --> 18:00.243
Right, stay with him and make
sure we don't lose the house.

18:00.588 --> 18:02.231
Okay.

18:09.723 --> 18:11.342
Where the fuck is she?

18:12.256 --> 18:13.691
I don't know.

18:16.188 --> 18:18.049
Maybe she's
leading us out of here.

18:19.488 --> 18:20.922
Might be a city or something.

18:21.122 --> 18:22.555
We're nowhere near a city.

18:22.755 --> 18:24.121
How do you know?

18:24.321 --> 18:26.190
That.

18:28.686 --> 18:29.588
What do you mean?

18:29.788 --> 18:31.587
Stars are too bright.

18:31.787 --> 18:33.327
We're miles from anywhere.

18:35.187 --> 18:37.289
After you.

18:37.788 --> 18:40.288
- Go.
- No, please. I insist.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.254
Fuck off. Go.

18:43.454 --> 18:46.335
Will you two hurry up?
We're losing her.

19:18.352 --> 19:20.091
What's that smell?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.230
Oh, my God!

19:41.716 --> 19:43.793
Who would do this?

19:53.282 --> 19:54.822
Someone likes to decorate.

19:56.148 --> 19:58.021
Another one?

20:08.714 --> 20:09.981
Look at this.

20:10.181 --> 20:11.649
What is it?

20:12.148 --> 20:13.879
It's Latin.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.316
I can read Latin.

20:17.814 --> 20:19.920
Here, let me try.

20:24.414 --> 20:27.981
No, nothing.

20:33.480 --> 20:37.346
Well, I mean, physically,
I can do stuff.

20:37.546 --> 20:41.983
It's like my hands remember,
my body remembers.

20:45.479 --> 20:47.100
My brain's a complete blank.

20:50.578 --> 20:51.999
Do you know this place?

20:53.078 --> 20:54.379
You know this house?

20:54.811 --> 20:56.180
No.

20:57.678 --> 21:00.111
But I know these books.

21:00.311 --> 21:04.444
They're all medical,
biological reference books.

21:04.644 --> 21:09.144
I mean, from different countries,
different periods in history.

21:09.344 --> 21:12.846
They all relate to human
and animal anatomy.

21:14.344 --> 21:15.977
Wait a second.

21:16.177 --> 21:18.113
What is it?

21:20.610 --> 21:22.979
- Oh, my God.
- What?

21:26.475 --> 21:28.077
What?

21:28.576 --> 21:30.911
I can speak French.

21:34.109 --> 21:35.690
I think this is your house.

22:14.740 --> 22:16.671
Whoa!

22:18.239 --> 22:19.806
Oh, my God.

22:24.705 --> 22:26.714
She's feeding her like a baby.

22:39.039 --> 22:40.772
Fuck me!

22:53.470 --> 22:54.770
You used me!

22:56.103 --> 22:58.039
Jesus!
She knows you.

22:59.537 --> 23:01.717
I'm telling you, Sharon,
I don't trust him.

23:08.537 --> 23:10.720
I have a daughter!

23:27.202 --> 23:28.623
Someone is watching us.

23:29.735 --> 23:32.007
What?

23:37.501 --> 23:40.235
I'm not just
leaving her in there.

23:40.435 --> 23:43.035
We have to. She was
tied up for a reason.

23:43.533 --> 23:46.001
It is inhumane.

23:46.201 --> 23:48.534
She attacked you! Did you forget this?
She's a crazy woman.

23:48.734 --> 23:50.735
You're unbelievable.

23:51.234 --> 23:52.200
Listen...

23:52.400 --> 23:54.067
What?

23:54.267 --> 23:56.099
There was a camera in the shack!

23:56.299 --> 23:58.279
We need to find
the monitoring center.

24:00.532 --> 24:02.792
Only building we've seen
so far is the house.

24:17.799 --> 24:21.232
It's Italian.

24:21.432 --> 24:24.735
It means, "A man with a lot of
keys has a lot of things to hide."

24:28.499 --> 24:31.866
Turns out, I know
a few languages.

24:33.363 --> 24:35.268
- Congratulations.
- Hmm.

24:38.764 --> 24:41.130
Try this...

24:52.662 --> 24:54.064
That's crazy.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.100
We both know Latin?

25:00.595 --> 25:03.098
You know, I have the strongest
feeling I know you.

25:04.596 --> 25:06.095
Really?

25:06.295 --> 25:09.564
Yeah. Yeah.

25:11.062 --> 25:13.028
Yeah, I feel like
I know Sharon, too.

25:13.228 --> 25:18.195
I mean, not as familiar as I feel
with you, but it's there with her.

25:18.395 --> 25:20.535
I keep thinking
maybe she's my girlfriend.

25:21.460 --> 25:23.160
Or my sister.

25:23.360 --> 25:26.021
She could be my sister, and
that would be pretty gross.

25:26.228 --> 25:27.807
You think she like me?

25:30.659 --> 25:32.927
I don't
have time for this, okay?

25:33.127 --> 25:35.262
I got to get this door open.

25:36.760 --> 25:40.427
I gotta try to find some tools,
like a crowbar or something,

25:40.627 --> 25:42.293
get it in there and just
try and pry it open.

25:42.493 --> 25:45.193
You're not going to pry
that open with a crowbar.

25:45.393 --> 25:46.593
How do you know?
You haven't even tried.

25:46.793 --> 25:48.325
No. That's a reinforced
iron door.

25:48.525 --> 25:49.560
You're not going to get it
opened with a crowbar.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.565
What about your keys?

25:56.059 --> 25:57.999
Where'd you get
those keys, John Doe?

26:00.459 --> 26:02.158
I found them.

26:02.358 --> 26:04.826
Where'd you find them?

26:05.325 --> 26:07.859
Downstairs, in the living room,

26:08.059 --> 26:09.999
with all the books
that you can read.

26:12.325 --> 26:14.095
Someone's in here, Nathan?

26:17.591 --> 26:19.261
Listen...

26:22.757 --> 26:25.123
I'm not trying to make
an enemy here, okay?

26:25.323 --> 26:28.790
It's just, uh... We can't
bash the door in now.

26:29.289 --> 26:30.910
Everybody's trying to sleep.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.890
It's been a long night.

26:34.090 --> 26:36.391
I think you should get
a couple hours of rest.

26:37.289 --> 26:39.122
All of your...

26:41.256 --> 26:43.892
Locked doors will still
be here when you wake up.

26:53.289 --> 26:54.856
We need to find the cars.

26:55.056 --> 26:56.189
I think he's got a point.

26:56.389 --> 26:57.722
No, you think he's got a point,

26:57.922 --> 27:01.255
but I wasn't here when you guys had
the meeting that made him boss, okay?

27:01.455 --> 27:03.855
This time, no, or
I'm going with you.

27:04.055 --> 27:05.588
You need me.

27:06.087 --> 27:07.954
Why?

27:08.154 --> 27:09.889
Why?
'Cause I'm the best shot.

27:11.387 --> 27:13.260
How do we know?

27:17.754 --> 27:19.153
Jesus Christ, Michael!

27:19.353 --> 27:20.453
What the hell?

27:20.653 --> 27:23.386
How about that?
You know now?

27:23.586 --> 27:25.407
You stay here
and guard the house.

27:29.587 --> 27:31.208
Why won't they listen to me?

27:32.053 --> 27:33.713
Because of what you just did.

28:00.651 --> 28:02.250
Is he dead?

28:02.450 --> 28:03.988
I hope so.

28:10.417 --> 28:13.449
This fence must run the
whole way around the house.

28:13.649 --> 28:15.816
Oh, that smell!
I can't handle it.

28:17.116 --> 28:18.757
Lukas?

28:25.250 --> 28:27.708
Somebody's put them
up all around the house.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.787
Maybe it's a warning.

28:33.249 --> 28:35.228
It's the same as the last night.

28:51.514 --> 28:53.580
Why won't they listen to me?

28:53.780 --> 28:56.218
You know,
I could've helped them.

28:59.714 --> 29:01.119
It's my job.

29:06.613 --> 29:10.284
It's my job.

29:14.779 --> 29:16.650
Why would I have this?

29:20.145 --> 29:22.680
And who are you to me?

29:23.179 --> 29:25.815
You...
My wife? Girlfriend?

29:28.312 --> 29:29.511
If I knew what was going on...

29:29.711 --> 29:32.211
Because, I'm not like the others.
They're all smart!

29:32.411 --> 29:35.084
But I'm... I'm here
to do something.

29:40.578 --> 29:43.012
How do we know one another?

29:43.511 --> 29:45.548
My quiet girl.

29:48.045 --> 29:49.880
This thing between us, it's...

29:51.378 --> 29:54.548
It's important.
I know it.

30:00.610 --> 30:02.543
Get in the house.
Get inside, now! Now!

30:02.743 --> 30:04.810
Just move! Go!

30:05.309 --> 30:07.577
Go inside.

30:07.777 --> 30:10.276
Okay, now you go in, and you
lock the door. Close it!

30:10.476 --> 30:12.569
Now!

30:38.041 --> 30:40.550
What do you think?
Which way?

31:22.205 --> 31:24.142
Really?
You're throwing rocks?

32:31.734 --> 32:33.906
Well, we have cars.

32:50.666 --> 32:52.804
Please!

32:56.299 --> 32:58.668
Please, help!

33:01.165 --> 33:04.032
Please, help!

33:04.530 --> 33:05.830
Help!

33:11.064 --> 33:13.503
Please!

33:28.363 --> 33:30.198
Please...

33:31.696 --> 33:34.964
Please help!

33:39.196 --> 33:42.196
Okay. Okay.

33:42.695 --> 33:46.199
- Please help!
- Jesus!

33:48.696 --> 33:50.130
Help.

33:51.627 --> 33:55.667
- Ahhh!
- Okay, okay, okay. Okay? Okay?

34:00.161 --> 34:02.135
Shh...

34:09.626 --> 34:11.795
Easy. We're gonna
work on this.

34:12.293 --> 34:14.192
Please...

34:15.592 --> 34:17.195
Ahhh!

34:24.293 --> 34:25.730
Ahhh!

35:00.991 --> 35:03.625
Please. Help me...

35:05.123 --> 35:06.957
Come on!

35:10.690 --> 35:12.856
It's got a quarter tank.

35:13.056 --> 35:16.156
Battery is dead here.
Look if there's fuel inside.

35:16.356 --> 35:19.124
Yeah, it's okay, Nate.
We can push start it.

35:20.622 --> 35:22.125
Nate.

35:30.622 --> 35:33.125
What's the matter?

35:35.622 --> 35:36.991
Headache. Nothing.

35:39.488 --> 35:42.287
Okay, this is low on gas,

35:42.487 --> 35:45.120
but I think we should just try and drive
out of here and see what we can find.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.123
There's no we.

35:48.621 --> 35:49.921
What?

35:52.387 --> 35:53.862
You're not with us.

36:00.354 --> 36:03.090
I could be the one
taking the photo?

36:06.586 --> 36:08.454
Guys, we need to get help.

36:08.654 --> 36:10.589
We're not near anything.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.988
We'll end up without fuel in
the middle of fucking nowhere.

36:17.485 --> 36:20.186
Let's get back to the house,
figure out what's going on.

36:22.386 --> 36:24.089
He's got a point.

36:27.584 --> 36:28.884
Sharon...

36:39.250 --> 36:41.190
Guys!

36:47.683 --> 36:49.521
Michael!

36:52.017 --> 36:53.476
Jesus.

36:55.716 --> 36:57.856
Help me move him!

37:02.350 --> 37:05.449
Okay. There we go.

37:05.649 --> 37:07.382
- We got to support his head. Jesus!
- I got him.

37:07.582 --> 37:09.783
Jesus... Oh, my God...

37:09.983 --> 37:11.523
We need to stop the blood.

37:12.649 --> 37:14.650
Fuck...

37:15.149 --> 37:16.982
Michael, I need you
to look at me.

37:17.481 --> 37:20.051
Michael. Michael...

37:22.548 --> 37:24.850
- Michael, breathe! Michael!
- Sharon...

37:26.348 --> 37:27.918
Come on, Michael.

37:31.414 --> 37:32.714
Michael.

37:34.081 --> 37:35.748
Michael!

37:36.247 --> 37:37.954
Jesus!

37:43.448 --> 37:45.946
We...

37:46.146 --> 37:48.247
We were in the hospital.
We could have...

37:50.446 --> 37:51.867
- I just need...
- Ahhh!

38:07.178 --> 38:08.912
Leave him here.
Don't touch the body.

38:09.112 --> 38:10.411
- What's wrong with you?
- John!

38:10.611 --> 38:12.346
John, no.

38:12.546 --> 38:15.078
We're going to bury him, right?
I mean...

38:15.278 --> 38:16.377
You're not just gonna
leave him lying there

38:16.577 --> 38:18.478
like the sicko
tying people to trees...

38:18.678 --> 38:20.478
It's Michael.
We're gonna bury him.

38:20.678 --> 38:23.410
Look, something is happening
on the 18th. That is tomorrow.

38:23.610 --> 38:26.030
- We don't have time. I'm going to the...
- Wait.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.878
- I think we should all stick together.
- Yeah.

38:37.376 --> 38:40.354
- To be honest, I'm not sure we're safe.
- Neither am I.

38:41.243 --> 38:43.045
Lukas...

38:43.544 --> 38:46.076
Nathan, come on.

38:46.276 --> 38:49.042
- We need to stick together.
- I'd rather take you across.

38:49.242 --> 38:51.208
Nathan, can I have your keys?

38:51.408 --> 38:54.069
I can push start your car.
Can I please have your keys?

38:56.309 --> 38:57.609
Thank you.

38:59.608 --> 39:01.776
- I will go.
- What?

39:02.275 --> 39:03.974
No-one
should go alone.

39:17.708 --> 39:19.841
Okay, come on.

39:20.041 --> 39:22.140
Come on, please. Come
on, you piece of crap.

39:22.340 --> 39:24.039
Come on, now.

39:24.239 --> 39:26.840
Sweat it out there.
Okay, now!

39:27.040 --> 39:28.699
Here we go.

39:29.540 --> 39:31.182
Okay, stop. Stop!

39:49.439 --> 39:51.588
Hey...
Up there on the left.

40:06.072 --> 40:07.478
Hello.

40:13.971 --> 40:15.391
It's too quiet.

40:41.269 --> 40:43.236
This is empty.

40:43.436 --> 40:44.895
Yeah. These, too.

40:59.034 --> 41:00.568
- Did you see that?
- No.

41:01.067 --> 41:02.968
What?

41:03.168 --> 41:04.201
- There was a kid.
- Where?

41:04.401 --> 41:05.902
Hello?

41:07.400 --> 41:09.184
Hello!

41:25.666 --> 41:27.569
Hello.

41:29.067 --> 41:30.648
God damn it.
There's no one.

41:36.332 --> 41:37.632
Sharon!

41:42.664 --> 41:44.567
What's your name?

41:45.066 --> 41:47.699
Come and open the door.

41:48.198 --> 41:49.900
Do you...
Do you recognize me?

41:52.397 --> 41:54.732
Here. Come here.

41:55.231 --> 41:57.798
Do you recognize this lady?

41:57.998 --> 42:00.831
Go away, Jonah!
They're coming tomorrow!

42:01.031 --> 42:02.030
- No.
- No, no. Come back.

42:02.230 --> 42:04.063
- Please... No.
- No. He knows me.

42:04.263 --> 42:06.804
He called me Jonah.

42:14.295 --> 42:16.954
All these languages,
and not one of them yours.

42:29.661 --> 42:31.066
Hey...

42:35.561 --> 42:36.995
You okay?

42:37.195 --> 42:38.734
Hey! Let me help you.

42:45.427 --> 42:47.526
<i>Get away from me.</i>

42:53.361 --> 42:55.360
What's wrong?

42:55.560 --> 42:58.528
<i>No! Please don't!</i>

43:00.026 --> 43:01.777
My head...

43:18.258 --> 43:20.534
I know you.

43:28.025 --> 43:29.325
I know you.

43:35.591 --> 43:37.823
Hey, Lukas...

43:38.023 --> 43:40.791
Lukas, stop it. You're...
Lukas, get off her!

43:40.991 --> 43:43.224
Lukas, stop it!

43:43.424 --> 43:45.726
Stop it!

43:48.523 --> 43:49.791
Okay.

43:49.991 --> 43:51.291
Okay, relax.

43:53.556 --> 43:55.992
<i>Lukas! Stop it!</i>

43:58.489 --> 44:01.563
Are you okay?

44:07.057 --> 44:09.561
Are you okay now?

44:15.055 --> 44:16.355
I'm okay.

44:20.388 --> 44:21.725
I'm okay.

44:25.221 --> 44:27.593
I can hear him, Sharon.
He's still in there.

44:33.654 --> 44:35.056
Fuck!

44:36.554 --> 44:39.556
Hey! Call your dog off!

44:41.054 --> 44:43.853
- It's okay.
- I'm not kidding around now, buddy.

44:44.053 --> 44:46.953
- Call the dog off!
- I'm gonna set my dog on you!

44:47.153 --> 44:50.820
- Get out of here!
- Don't test me! Don't fucking test me!

44:51.020 --> 44:53.153
- Just... Just open the door first.
- Okay, that's it!

44:53.353 --> 44:54.353
- Go away!
- What are you doing?

44:54.553 --> 44:55.419
- Stand back!
- Stop it!

44:55.619 --> 44:57.298
- He knows me!
- Jesus!

44:58.420 --> 45:00.886
Leave us alone, Jonah.

45:01.086 --> 45:02.285
That is not gonna help!

45:02.485 --> 45:04.053
- You get out of there...
- Stop it!

45:04.253 --> 45:05.451
- You're scaring him!
- Stay out of this!

45:05.651 --> 45:07.219
- Stop it!
- Stay out of it.

45:07.419 --> 45:08.719
- Stop it!
- Hey!

45:09.185 --> 45:10.985
For fuck's sake, this isn't helping!
Please!

45:11.185 --> 45:12.518
This is not gonna help!

45:12.718 --> 45:14.451
- Stand back!
- Jesus!

45:16.717 --> 45:18.897
- Come on, open it?
- My dog will kill you!

45:20.185 --> 45:23.418
Run and hide!
Run and hide!

45:23.618 --> 45:26.384
Please, please. We just
need some answers, okay?

45:26.584 --> 45:28.651
Please, please.
He's so loud.

45:29.150 --> 45:31.485
Fucking stop it!

45:31.984 --> 45:34.022
Out of the way, Sharon.

45:45.517 --> 45:47.850
Stop! What the fuck
are you doing?

45:48.050 --> 45:48.983
I'm going to cut
the fucking door.

45:49.183 --> 45:50.651
It's a child!

45:52.149 --> 45:53.821
He knows me.
He knows my name.

45:59.315 --> 46:01.552
I don't even know my name.

46:04.049 --> 46:05.751
This isn't you, John.

46:08.248 --> 46:09.666
You'll be okay.

46:27.146 --> 46:29.405
Okay, symptoms...

46:30.246 --> 46:32.880
Headache, nausea...

46:33.080 --> 46:35.081
Hyperventilating...

46:35.579 --> 46:37.047
Delirious...

46:38.545 --> 46:40.214
Violent.

46:40.713 --> 46:42.883
It's... You think that...

46:46.379 --> 46:48.911
Wish I could
speak your language.

46:49.946 --> 46:51.845
Okay, uh...

46:52.045 --> 46:54.714
There was a woman.
She was tied up.

46:56.212 --> 46:57.712
She was blind in one eye.

46:58.178 --> 47:00.378
She had a bad eye.

47:00.578 --> 47:03.011
The one you were feeding.
They told me about it.

47:03.211 --> 47:05.112
Yeah?

47:05.611 --> 47:07.069
Hey.

47:08.311 --> 47:10.077
I need your help.

47:10.576 --> 47:11.876
Please help me.

47:48.275 --> 47:50.180
I know this place.

47:53.675 --> 47:54.975
She escaped.

48:04.374 --> 48:07.191
I think there's a path
around the lake.

48:34.605 --> 48:37.174
Well, I need to know
where it leads.

48:37.673 --> 48:39.884
I'm going.

48:52.370 --> 48:54.270
<i>My name...</i>

48:54.470 --> 48:56.271
<i>Is Nathan. Nathan.</i>

48:56.471 --> 48:57.771
<i>Nathan's my name.</i>

49:00.004 --> 49:01.304
<i>Remember.</i>

49:05.403 --> 49:07.539
<i>Nate.
You can call me Nate.</i>

49:09.037 --> 49:11.774
<i>Tree...
Cracked by lightning.</i>

49:15.270 --> 49:19.136
<i>Two trees,
either side of the path.</i>

49:19.635 --> 49:21.939
<i>And then...</i>

49:24.436 --> 49:26.240
<i>Tree trunk.</i>

50:35.463 --> 50:37.263
<i>- I'm irresponsible?
- Yes!</i>

50:37.463 --> 50:39.098
<i>This whole thing is your fault.</i>

50:39.298 --> 50:41.063
<i>I don't need
a fucking baby sitter.</i>

50:41.263 --> 50:42.764
<i>Okay, stop it,
you two! Stop it!</i>

50:42.964 --> 50:45.997
<i>Oh, it's my fault? It's not
my fucking fault! I didn't do this!</i>

50:46.197 --> 50:47.964
<i>I didn't do any of this.</i>

50:48.164 --> 50:48.997
<i>God, forgive me.</i>

50:49.197 --> 50:50.430
<i>He's too heavy.
Hold him tight.</i>

50:50.630 --> 50:52.263
<i>Come on, help me, Nathan!</i>

50:52.463 --> 50:54.762
<i>Nathan, tie his legs up.</i>

50:54.962 --> 50:56.621
<i>They're not animals.</i>

51:02.196 --> 51:04.011
<i>This is inhumane.</i>

51:19.494 --> 51:20.794
You...

51:44.693 --> 51:46.598
Don't leave me alone.
Please!

51:51.093 --> 51:52.928
I'm not going to hurt you.

51:55.425 --> 51:58.032
Don't leave me alone.

52:03.526 --> 52:05.497
I know I can trust you.

52:09.992 --> 52:11.527
You can trust me.

52:18.425 --> 52:20.424
Let me in.

52:21.924 --> 52:23.659
I remember you smiling at me.

52:25.156 --> 52:27.789
I remember you.

52:31.157 --> 52:32.892
Let me in!

52:33.391 --> 52:35.209
I remember you.

52:53.689 --> 52:55.859
I'm not going to hurt you.

55:09.580 --> 55:11.984
Helen.

55:25.978 --> 55:27.650
Your name is Helen.

55:31.146 --> 55:33.546
I'm sorry about your daughter.

55:34.044 --> 55:35.844
We wanted to help...

56:11.110 --> 56:12.410
Ahhh!

56:21.675 --> 56:25.208
<i>Day 96, this is subject 143,</i>

56:25.408 --> 56:28.042
<i>who I captured in the woods.</i>

56:28.242 --> 56:30.775
<i>He's the first positive
result that I've had,</i>

56:30.975 --> 56:33.708
<i>and, uh, he's responding
to the injection, I believe.</i>

56:33.908 --> 56:35.877
<i>It proves that
I'm onto something.</i>

56:37.375 --> 56:40.140
<i>And then, uh,
one unfortunate side-effect</i>

56:40.340 --> 56:42.375
<i>is a period of unconsciousness</i>

56:42.575 --> 56:45.008
<i>followed by acute memory loss.</i>

56:45.208 --> 56:48.808
<i>But he doesn't
remember anything.</i>

56:49.008 --> 56:50.239
<i>...two stages that he's going through.</i>

56:50.439 --> 56:51.973
<i>The first stage
is the rest cycle.</i>

56:52.173 --> 56:54.939
<i>He looks calm...
Almost dead.</i>

56:55.139 --> 56:57.239
<i>His heartbeat decreases
to 30 beats per minute.</i>

56:57.439 --> 56:59.372
<i>I don't know why
it's wearing off so quickly.</i>

56:59.572 --> 57:02.706
<i>I just...
I need it to hold.</i>

57:02.906 --> 57:05.839
<i>I need it to hold! Why is he not
responding? It should work!</i>

57:06.039 --> 57:07.972
<i>This should work!
I'm trying everything!</i>

57:08.172 --> 57:09.927
<i>Her blood should be...</i>

57:10.127 --> 57:12.406
<i>- Please! Please stop!
- Now you can see...</i>

57:12.606 --> 57:15.607
<i>He looks like he's suffering
from extreme headaches.</i>

57:16.106 --> 57:17.838
<i>He's got extreme strength.</i>

57:28.971 --> 57:30.805
Do you remember your family?

57:31.005 --> 57:32.870
I can't remember my mother.

57:33.070 --> 57:35.050
Who doesn't remember
their own mother?

57:37.436 --> 57:39.873
I know that I know you.

57:42.370 --> 57:44.607
I feel like I know you.

57:48.103 --> 57:50.405
Sometimes, I, uh...

57:51.903 --> 57:53.870
I feel like I might have...

57:54.369 --> 57:56.737
Done some things
that I wasn't proud of...

57:57.236 --> 58:00.303
That I might not like
the man I was, you know?

58:00.503 --> 58:01.971
Watch out!

58:09.402 --> 58:11.412
Where the hell
did that come from?

58:20.901 --> 58:22.402
What's that sound?

58:50.599 --> 58:52.779
Be careful. I got a bad
feeling about this.

58:55.466 --> 58:56.732
- No, I don't...
- Excuse me!

58:56.932 --> 58:58.232
I don't like it.

59:02.431 --> 59:04.603
- Excuse me!
- No! Shh.

59:08.099 --> 59:09.399
Let's go.

59:10.364 --> 59:12.197
Okay, maybe you were right.

59:12.397 --> 59:14.432
Shit!

59:14.930 --> 59:16.230
Come on!

59:21.497 --> 59:22.930
Sharon!

59:23.130 --> 59:24.735
Come on!

59:28.230 --> 59:30.100
Get in the car!

59:33.596 --> 59:35.177
Go! Go!
Oh, my God, come on!

59:36.596 --> 59:39.697
- John, come on! Come on, let's go.
- Fuck!

59:39.897 --> 59:42.075
Put it in reverse!
Put it in reverse!

59:42.463 --> 59:43.864
Come on!

59:50.595 --> 59:52.696
They're right on me!
They're right on me!

59:54.962 --> 59:56.262
What...

01:00:04.561 --> 01:00:06.166
What?

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:14.462
They don't like
the smell or something.

01:00:19.326 --> 01:00:21.193
They are deterrents.

01:00:21.393 --> 01:00:23.173
Someone hung them up on purpose.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.138
They're being
used like scarecrows.

01:00:41.358 --> 01:00:43.598
Be careful.

01:00:48.092 --> 01:00:49.392
You're a sick fuck.

01:00:52.258 --> 01:00:54.957
I knew it was you.

01:00:55.157 --> 01:00:58.057
Lukas, put your fucking gun down, man.
You're losing your mind.

01:00:58.257 --> 01:01:00.393
What did you do to me?

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:04.624
- Who are you!
- What are you talking about, man?

01:01:05.123 --> 01:01:06.663
Lukas, what are you doing?

01:01:07.157 --> 01:01:09.492
It's him, Sharon.

01:01:09.991 --> 01:01:11.791
It's all in here.

01:01:11.991 --> 01:01:14.131
I told you you shouldn't
have let him out.

01:01:15.222 --> 01:01:17.459
He was doing experiments
on us or something.

01:01:18.956 --> 01:01:20.857
He had us all in prison.

01:01:21.356 --> 01:01:23.159
He's a murderer.

01:01:24.656 --> 01:01:25.956
John...

01:01:28.222 --> 01:01:30.626
What's he talking about?

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:35.591
What's on the tape?

01:01:38.088 --> 01:01:39.989
I... I don't know.

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:41.788
I can't remember.

01:01:45.254 --> 01:01:48.056
I was trying to tell you
before in the car...

01:01:49.554 --> 01:01:52.221
I've been having some memories.

01:01:52.421 --> 01:01:54.922
Bad memories of doing
really bad things.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.889
For fuck's sake, Sharon,
can you trust me, please?

01:02:01.387 --> 01:02:02.922
I wanted to tell you.

01:02:05.419 --> 01:02:08.354
I just didn't know how.
I thought you knew me.

01:02:08.554 --> 01:02:10.820
And like I knew you.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.219
- Sharon...
- Please, I was hoping...

01:02:13.419 --> 01:02:16.055
Maybe I was somebody
else because I knew you.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.720
- Please...
- You stand back.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.419
I just... Okay.

01:02:20.619 --> 01:02:22.386
You don't fucking move or I'll
shoot you where you're standing

01:02:22.586 --> 01:02:24.647
and hang you from
the next fucking tree.

01:02:26.285 --> 01:02:28.823
Watch it.
Come on, Sharon, watch it.

01:02:32.318 --> 01:02:33.987
Have a look.

01:02:38.918 --> 01:02:40.917
<i>I'm trying everything.
This should work.</i>

01:02:41.117 --> 01:02:42.884
What is it, Sharon?

01:02:43.084 --> 01:02:44.884
<i>Please. Please, stop.</i>

01:02:45.084 --> 01:02:46.384
What's on the tape?

01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:50.717
I have needle marks on my arm.

01:02:51.216 --> 01:02:52.985
See?

01:02:54.483 --> 01:02:56.086
I bet you have them, too.

01:02:57.584 --> 01:02:59.817
Was that...
Is that from me?

01:03:00.017 --> 01:03:02.149
- Lukas, god damn it!
- You shut the fuck up!

01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:04.153
Okay.

01:03:07.649 --> 01:03:09.815
I don't remember that.
Did I do that?

01:03:10.015 --> 01:03:11.115
Lukas, did I do this to her?

01:03:11.315 --> 01:03:13.182
I got to kill him.

01:03:13.382 --> 01:03:15.715
I just wanna know what I did, okay?
I'm not sure.

01:03:15.915 --> 01:03:18.415
I remember pieces, but I don't...
Lukas, please listen.

01:03:18.615 --> 01:03:20.415
Okay, I will turn around,
and I wouldn't hurt you.

01:03:20.615 --> 01:03:22.635
- No.
- Sharon, please don't let him...

01:03:48.347 --> 01:03:50.113
You crawl!

01:03:50.313 --> 01:03:52.945
Get into the pit with all your
victims, you twisted fuck!

01:03:53.145 --> 01:03:54.714
No, not in there, man.
Come on!

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:56.845
Go!

01:03:57.045 --> 01:03:58.879
Okay, okay!
Okay, I'm going.

01:03:59.079 --> 01:04:00.781
I'm going. I'm going.

01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:24.728
Lukas!

01:04:44.142 --> 01:04:45.847
<i>Take it yourself.</i>

01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:50.594
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:05:07.954 --> 01:05:09.773
<i>Did you get blood in your mouth?</i>

01:05:22.274 --> 01:05:23.675
We trying, okay?

01:05:24.174 --> 01:05:25.840
We trying.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.072
We'll pack up and get
fuck out of this place.

01:05:31.873 --> 01:05:34.106
Your key.
Give me the key.

01:05:34.306 --> 01:05:36.808
Give me the keys.
I'll go and get your car.

01:05:38.305 --> 01:05:40.173
What about Nathan?

01:05:40.373 --> 01:05:42.409
- Does he know?
- Who?

01:05:43.907 --> 01:05:45.508
Nathan.

01:05:47.006 --> 01:05:49.041
No... No.

01:05:50.538 --> 01:05:52.439
The one in the pit
is the one who did this.

01:05:52.639 --> 01:05:54.044
It's... It's... John.

01:06:04.071 --> 01:06:05.576
Lukas.

01:06:09.072 --> 01:06:10.373
You okay?

01:06:10.872 --> 01:06:12.170
No, I'm not okay.

01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:15.004
I'm all fucked up

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:18.770
because of your Nazi boyfriend
doing experiments on me.

01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:20.605
Lukas.

01:06:21.104 --> 01:06:22.436
You need to sit down.

01:06:22.636 --> 01:06:24.436
You don't look well.

01:06:24.636 --> 01:06:28.072
No, no, no.
You're safe with me.

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:32.104
No, you're safe now.

01:06:32.603 --> 01:06:35.302
Do you hear me?
You're safe with me. Okay?

01:06:35.502 --> 01:06:37.037
I'll take care
of you. Okay?

01:06:37.237 --> 01:06:39.037
Lukas...

01:06:39.237 --> 01:06:40.702
You're scaring me, okay...

01:06:40.902 --> 01:06:43.535
I'll take care of you, too.

01:06:46.401 --> 01:06:48.435
You're safe with me.

01:06:48.635 --> 01:06:51.769
They tried to take you away
from me, but you're safe now.

01:06:52.268 --> 01:06:55.135
Lukas, please.

01:06:55.634 --> 01:06:57.434
You're ill.
You're sick.

01:06:57.634 --> 01:06:58.934
I'm okay.

01:07:03.001 --> 01:07:04.904
I'm okay.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.021
- Lukas...
- Don't touch her!

01:07:12.433 --> 01:07:13.967
She can't hurt you.

01:07:14.167 --> 01:07:15.467
I will protect you!

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:17.668
Remember.

01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:19.776
Wait!

01:07:37.199 --> 01:07:39.232
Look at me!
Look at me!

01:07:39.432 --> 01:07:40.768
Look at me!

01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:44.297
You must remember me.
You know me.

01:07:44.497 --> 01:07:45.797
You know me!

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:51.110
Beautiful girl.

01:08:02.597 --> 01:08:03.897
Get off her!

01:08:11.231 --> 01:08:12.961
No!

01:08:37.261 --> 01:08:38.863
Ugh!

01:09:18.059 --> 01:09:20.127
Tomorrow's the 18th.

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:23.560
There's no time left.

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:25.439
Yeah, the kid knew me.

01:09:26.892 --> 01:09:28.930
We need to get back
to that building.

01:09:33.425 --> 01:09:34.791
You need to stay away from me.

01:09:34.991 --> 01:09:37.026
It may not be safe
to be around me.

01:09:38.524 --> 01:09:40.890
I need the answers.

01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:42.823
Get in that house!

01:09:43.023 --> 01:09:44.669
Go!

01:10:10.222 --> 01:10:11.522
Jonah.

01:10:39.621 --> 01:10:41.983
Hello?

01:11:44.416 --> 01:11:46.116
<i>Please be careful with this.</i>

01:11:46.316 --> 01:11:48.983
<i>This is our last chance.</i>

01:11:49.183 --> 01:11:51.890
<i>We only have a couple of days.</i>

01:11:58.382 --> 01:11:59.949
<i>"Last chance."</i>

01:12:00.448 --> 01:12:02.127
<i>Last chance for what?</i>

01:12:03.282 --> 01:12:04.951
<i>The 18th.</i>

01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:09.750
<i>Come on, man, think!
What happens on the 18th?</i>

01:12:29.013 --> 01:12:30.873
<i>You have to follow
the main road.</i>

01:12:40.246 --> 01:12:41.704
<i>They'll meet you there.</i>

01:12:47.478 --> 01:12:49.480
<i>Do not stop for any...</i>

01:12:49.979 --> 01:12:52.847
Where the fuck were you going?

01:12:53.122 --> 01:12:54.244
God damn it!
Who were you meeting?

01:12:54.444 --> 01:12:55.813
Come on, man!

01:12:56.918 --> 01:12:58.078
<i>You have to follow
the main road.</i>

01:12:58.278 --> 01:12:59.648
Fuck!

01:13:38.575 --> 01:13:40.784
What the fuck is going on?

01:13:49.274 --> 01:13:50.879
Shit!

01:13:55.374 --> 01:13:58.544
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just need to get them.

01:14:00.042 --> 01:14:01.007
I...

01:14:01.207 --> 01:14:02.643
Fuck.

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.742
Just give them to me.

01:14:07.241 --> 01:14:09.374
Give it to me, you crazy bitch.

01:14:09.873 --> 01:14:12.038
No, no. No.

01:14:15.006 --> 01:14:16.406
You gotta be kidding me.

01:14:16.606 --> 01:14:18.385
What the fuck! Get back!

01:15:09.237 --> 01:15:10.638
Mamma!

01:15:11.137 --> 01:15:13.604
- You!
- Hey.

01:15:15.102 --> 01:15:16.869
Do you know me?

01:15:17.069 --> 01:15:18.569
'Cause that kid knows me.

01:15:19.268 --> 01:15:21.002
You are one of them.

01:15:21.202 --> 01:15:22.862
You stay away from my family!

01:15:23.169 --> 01:15:25.470
No more needles!

01:15:26.968 --> 01:15:28.548
Is this your daughter?

01:15:30.468 --> 01:15:32.404
You hurt us all, Jonah!

01:15:33.902 --> 01:15:37.767
I'll leave you alive
because I'm not like you.

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:39.669
- Run and hide.
- What?

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:41.767
What do you mean?

01:15:41.967 --> 01:15:43.835
Wait. Hang on, hang on!
Listen! Wait, wait, wait!

01:15:44.035 --> 01:15:46.696
Listen, please! Just hang on!
I just wanna talk to you!

01:15:48.334 --> 01:15:50.301
Please, just tell me!
What did I do?

01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:52.403
Please, I just wanna
talk to you!

01:15:54.899 --> 01:15:56.200
Where are you going?

01:16:31.265 --> 01:16:33.631
<i>Overgrown brain.</i>

01:16:33.831 --> 01:16:35.729
<i>Possible reason
for the headaches.</i>

01:16:36.132 --> 01:16:37.670
<i>White matter decomposing.</i>

01:16:42.397 --> 01:16:43.998
<i>The army will meet you there.</i>

01:16:44.198 --> 01:16:45.922
<i>They know what to do with it.</i>

01:17:10.395 --> 01:17:11.768
The army.

01:17:17.262 --> 01:17:19.522
What does the military
have to do to with it?

01:17:23.228 --> 01:17:24.896
Jonah Cooke.

01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:27.416
Jonah Cooke.

01:17:49.892 --> 01:17:51.192
Sharon?

01:17:55.359 --> 01:17:56.826
Sharon?

01:17:57.026 --> 01:17:59.528
Look, it's John! John!

01:18:01.026 --> 01:18:02.361
Oh, shit!

01:18:13.125 --> 01:18:15.361
Lukas.

01:18:17.816 --> 01:18:18.657
Jesus, Lukas, you're sick.

01:18:18.857 --> 01:18:20.157
<i>No!</i>

01:18:20.357 --> 01:18:21.925
<i>Shh! You should
calm down, man.</i>

01:18:22.125 --> 01:18:22.890
<i>This will help you.</i>

01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:24.191
I was helping you.

01:18:24.391 --> 01:18:25.391
Go away.

01:18:25.591 --> 01:18:27.390
Lukas, I was helping you!

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:30.367
I was helping all of you.

01:18:45.889 --> 01:18:47.390
Lukas. Lukas.

01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:49.290
I'm remembering things.

01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:52.189
My name...is...is Jonah.

01:18:52.389 --> 01:18:53.254
Do you remember me?
I'm a doctor.

01:18:53.454 --> 01:18:55.189
You've been infected?

01:18:55.389 --> 01:18:57.321
I need to inject you with this.

01:18:57.521 --> 01:18:59.722
This can help you.

01:18:59.922 --> 01:19:01.621
Look at me.
You remember me?

01:19:01.821 --> 01:19:03.854
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

01:19:04.054 --> 01:19:05.255
Look at me, buddy.
Give your arm.

01:19:05.455 --> 01:19:06.855
I was just trying to help you.

01:19:07.055 --> 01:19:08.388
The dose has worn off.
I need to...

01:19:08.588 --> 01:19:09.953
No, don't! Come on!

01:19:11.488 --> 01:19:12.787
Lukas!

01:19:12.987 --> 01:19:14.458
Oh, fuck!

01:19:16.954 --> 01:19:18.254
Look, Lukas...

01:19:24.121 --> 01:19:25.997
Look at me, Lukas!

01:19:40.418 --> 01:19:41.721
Lukas, come on.

01:19:43.218 --> 01:19:44.919
Lukas. Lukas.

01:19:45.418 --> 01:19:47.684
Look at me. Look at me.

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.119
Stay with me.

01:19:49.319 --> 01:19:51.020
Stay with me. Come on!

01:19:52.518 --> 01:19:54.055
I...

01:19:56.552 --> 01:19:58.921
have hell in my head

01:20:02.417 --> 01:20:04.587
and I cannot run away from it.

01:20:07.084 --> 01:20:09.950
I know you.
Do you know me?

01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:12.686
Yeah. Yeah, I know you, too, man.
Come on.

01:20:13.185 --> 01:20:15.083
I know you.
Look at me.

01:20:15.283 --> 01:20:16.736
Look at me.
I know you.

01:20:35.216 --> 01:20:37.515
<i>I just want to
say thank you, Jonah,</i>

01:20:37.915 --> 01:20:40.618
<i>and to all of you
for saving my life.</i>

01:20:42.116 --> 01:20:44.016
<i>And also, you gave me
my memory back.</i>

01:20:44.216 --> 01:20:46.981
<i>I... I've really
missed them.</i>

01:20:47.181 --> 01:20:48.482
<i>Well, most of them.</i>

01:20:52.548 --> 01:20:54.114
<i>To memories?</i>

01:20:54.314 --> 01:20:56.492
<i>- To memories.
- To memories.</i>

01:21:01.834 --> 01:21:03.812
<i>Oh, shit!
Watch out!</i>

01:21:14.147 --> 01:21:15.805
<i>How did she get out, Nathan?</i>

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.679
<i>Nathan, did you lock up?</i>

01:21:25.212 --> 01:21:27.379
<i>Michael, go check
the other cells. Be careful!</i>

01:21:27.579 --> 01:21:29.318
<i>They haven't all been treated.</i>

01:21:31.978 --> 01:21:34.011
<i>Yeah?
Why am I here, Jonah?</i>

01:21:34.211 --> 01:21:35.511
<i>Why am I here?</i>

01:21:36.679 --> 01:21:38.577
<i>You're gonna play
big brother now?</i>

01:21:39.511 --> 01:21:41.611
<i>- Stop it!
- It's not my fault?</i>

01:21:41.811 --> 01:21:44.110
<i>It's not my fucking fault!
I didn't do this!</i>

01:21:44.878 --> 01:21:46.845
I didn't do any of this!

01:21:47.045 --> 01:21:48.783
<i>Help me take her into the pit.</i>

01:21:51.177 --> 01:21:52.648
<i>Take her yourself.</i>

01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:04.309
Jonah.

01:22:14.543 --> 01:22:17.046
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:22:20.542 --> 01:22:22.710
Jonah!

01:22:24.208 --> 01:22:25.508
Jonah!

01:22:26.842 --> 01:22:28.142
Jonah!

01:22:39.474 --> 01:22:41.046
Sharon.

01:22:44.541 --> 01:22:45.841
It's me.

01:22:53.807 --> 01:22:55.848
It's me.

01:23:03.339 --> 01:23:05.675
I remember.

01:23:06.908 --> 01:23:07.907
Oh, my God.

01:23:08.107 --> 01:23:10.306
- Nathan!
- I'll lock it up!

01:23:10.506 --> 01:23:12.309
Help me block the door!

01:23:24.871 --> 01:23:27.410
Come on. Come on, Sharon.
Remember.

01:23:32.904 --> 01:23:34.605
<i>Jesus, we can't find the woman.</i>

01:23:34.805 --> 01:23:36.371
<i>Do you copy?
Do you read?</i>

01:23:36.571 --> 01:23:38.236
<i>They're everywhere!
They're out of control!</i>

01:23:38.436 --> 01:23:40.737
<i>In the streets.
Do you copy...</i>

01:23:40.937 --> 01:23:43.869
<i>Michael, gather the group up
in the house and inject yourselves!</i>

01:23:44.069 --> 01:23:45.769
<i>That's crazy. It's not finished!
We didn't test it!</i>

01:23:45.969 --> 01:23:48.103
<i>Sharon? Sharon, listen!
There's no time!</i>

01:23:48.303 --> 01:23:50.803
<i>You have to inject yourself...</i>

01:23:54.103 --> 01:23:55.439
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

01:23:57.935 --> 01:23:59.807
<i>I'm fucking bit!</i>

01:24:04.302 --> 01:24:06.969
<i>We're not going to remember.</i>

01:24:07.468 --> 01:24:08.768
<i>Oh...</i>

01:24:10.803 --> 01:24:12.622
<i>My name is Jonah Cooke.</i>

01:24:20.268 --> 01:24:21.767
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:24:21.967 --> 01:24:24.547
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.569
Okay. Fuck.

01:24:42.065 --> 01:24:43.167
Oh, shit!

01:24:43.367 --> 01:24:44.907
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

01:24:45.232 --> 01:24:47.336
Okay, okay, okay.

01:24:49.833 --> 01:24:51.231
Where are they coming from?

01:24:51.431 --> 01:24:53.665
The scarecrows didn't stop them.

01:24:53.865 --> 01:24:55.298
Oh, my God.

01:24:55.498 --> 01:24:57.700
They're everywhere.

01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:59.721
- They're...
- Something is wrong!

01:25:00.898 --> 01:25:02.934
Here we go.
Here we go.

01:25:05.431 --> 01:25:06.936
Oh, my God!

01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:13.730
Fuck!

01:25:20.064 --> 01:25:21.764
- Shit!
- I have to tell Jonah.

01:25:23.031 --> 01:25:24.735
Jesus!

01:25:28.230 --> 01:25:30.010
Just in case
he doesn't remember.

01:25:30.963 --> 01:25:32.663
Just in case we don't make it.

01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:35.304
Okay.

01:25:41.797 --> 01:25:43.964
<i>We were here to help.</i>

01:25:45.462 --> 01:25:46.969
<i>But we failed.</i>

01:25:52.463 --> 01:25:53.763
<i>The plague spread.</i>

01:26:06.128 --> 01:26:09.570
<i>Sharon... Sharon, please remember.</i>

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:20.362
<i>We need to leave here.
We're out of time.</i>

01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:23.160
<i>They're coming.</i>

01:26:47.926 --> 01:26:49.893
The 18th.

01:26:50.392 --> 01:26:51.794
Eighteenth.

01:26:53.292 --> 01:26:56.025
The rescue party.

01:26:56.225 --> 01:26:58.291
They're coming on the 18th,
the dawn of the 18th.

01:26:58.491 --> 01:26:59.791
The 18th. We're...

01:26:59.991 --> 01:27:02.857
Hey! Hey, don't shoot!

01:27:03.057 --> 01:27:04.124
- Wait.
- We're... We're saved!

01:27:04.324 --> 01:27:05.724
- Uh, no.
- It's over.

01:27:05.924 --> 01:27:07.656
Sharon, it's over. Hey!

01:27:07.856 --> 01:27:10.257
We're alive in here!

01:27:10.457 --> 01:27:13.792
I'll go get them. I'll go get them.
Hey! Hey!

01:27:14.290 --> 01:27:16.189
Hey, it's okay!

01:27:16.389 --> 01:27:18.524
Hey, we're alive in here!

01:27:20.022 --> 01:27:21.723
Don't shoot!

01:27:22.222 --> 01:27:24.822
Sharon, come on!

01:27:25.022 --> 01:27:27.527
Come on!
Hey, we're alive!

01:27:31.023 --> 01:27:32.956
Hello?

01:27:33.455 --> 01:27:35.524
Hello?

01:27:37.022 --> 01:27:38.498
Sharon?

01:27:46.989 --> 01:27:48.723
Hello!

01:27:50.221 --> 01:27:51.659
Sharon!

01:27:56.154 --> 01:27:58.353
Is there anybody there?

01:27:58.553 --> 01:28:00.653
<i>Standing by for orders.</i>

01:28:05.554 --> 01:28:06.854
<i>No survivors.</i>

01:28:09.786 --> 01:28:11.597
You were supposed to rescue us.

01:28:21.086 --> 01:28:22.553
Please.

01:28:23.052 --> 01:28:24.602
No, wait.

01:29:29.314 --> 01:29:31.557
Please! Please!

01:29:41.046 --> 01:29:42.813
I'm so sorry.

01:29:43.013 --> 01:29:45.783
- I'm so sorry.
- I remember.

01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:49.548
I remember, Sharon.

01:29:50.777 --> 01:29:52.179
That was my brother.
That was my brother.

01:29:52.379 --> 01:29:53.679
I'm sorry.

01:30:25.145 --> 01:30:26.811
Wait. Wait.

01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:28.848
We need her.

01:30:31.345 --> 01:30:33.313
Sharon?

01:30:43.077 --> 01:30:45.210
Oh! Oh, God!

01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:47.410
You okay?

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:50.747
Did she get you?
Fuck! Come on!

01:30:54.242 --> 01:30:55.776
Here, here!

01:30:56.275 --> 01:30:58.136
Put this on.
Put this on. All done!

01:31:02.408 --> 01:31:04.876
Come on! Come on. The soldiers are coming.
We need to hide.

01:31:05.076 --> 01:31:06.376
Come on.

01:31:08.542 --> 01:31:10.962
Hurry up. They're coming!
Come on, we gotta hide.

01:31:12.975 --> 01:31:14.609
Come on! Come on!

01:31:14.809 --> 01:31:16.269
You're okay.
You're okay.

01:31:34.373 --> 01:31:36.410
Come on! Come on!

01:31:38.907 --> 01:31:40.575
Oh, shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit!

01:31:41.074 --> 01:31:42.739
Hang on.

01:31:42.939 --> 01:31:44.879
Hang on. I have to
stop the bleeding!

01:31:48.372 --> 01:31:50.072
Look at me.
They won't find us.

01:31:53.305 --> 01:31:54.610
Look at me, okay?

01:32:00.558 --> 01:32:02.039
- Okay. Come on, give me your arm.
- Jonah.

01:32:02.239 --> 01:32:03.971
Give me your arm.

01:32:04.171 --> 01:32:06.674
Come on.
We're just gonna hide.

01:32:09.171 --> 01:32:10.938
And we'll pretend we're dead.

01:32:11.138 --> 01:32:13.007
We're gonna wake up, okay?

01:32:15.504 --> 01:32:17.044
Oh, Jonah, listen to me...

01:32:21.304 --> 01:32:22.870
What's this?

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:24.730
You have to read this, Jonah.

01:32:26.203 --> 01:32:28.869
You can't forget. Please.

01:32:29.069 --> 01:32:30.835
This time,
you have to do it right.

01:32:31.035 --> 01:32:32.936
Please. For me.

01:32:33.136 --> 01:32:34.136
You better stay with me.

01:32:34.336 --> 01:32:36.904
Listen to me, okay?
You are Jonah.

01:32:37.403 --> 01:32:40.603
Don't forget, please.

01:32:41.102 --> 01:32:42.402
I love you.

01:32:43.401 --> 01:32:45.022
I'll never forget you again.

01:32:47.503 --> 01:32:49.268
I love you. You just
get some sleep, okay?

01:32:49.468 --> 01:32:50.768
Just go with me.

01:32:51.236 --> 01:32:52.971
I'm scared.

01:32:54.468 --> 01:32:56.968
- I don't wanna die.
- You won't die.

01:32:57.168 --> 01:32:59.708
You won't die. Come on, sweetie.
I won't forget you.

01:33:00.035 --> 01:33:02.043
You feel this?

01:33:10.533 --> 01:33:12.032
<i>My name is Jonah.</i>

01:33:14.333 --> 01:33:15.775
<i>My name is Jonah.</i>

01:34:42.028 --> 01:34:43.863
<i>My love,</i>

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.859
<i>I remembered everything.</i>

01:34:51.261 --> 01:34:54.027
<i>We were doctors on the
verge of finding a cure</i>

01:34:54.227 --> 01:34:58.432
<i>for an awful plague that has
cast the world into darkness.</i>

01:35:03.926 --> 01:35:07.031
Help me!
Please help me!

01:35:11.526 --> 01:35:14.826
<i>The mute woman is the answer.</i>

01:35:15.026 --> 01:35:16.993
<i>He blood is immune to the virus.</i>

01:35:17.492 --> 01:35:19.567
<i>You must protect her.</i>

01:35:27.058 --> 01:35:29.761
<i>You will find death
and madness everywhere.</i>

01:35:32.258 --> 01:35:35.332
<i>But you'll have to fight
to finish what we started.</i>

01:35:42.823 --> 01:35:45.026
<i>We have no time, Jonah.</i>

01:35:46.523 --> 01:35:49.029
<i>There are still people
waiting to be saved.</i>

01:35:53.524 --> 01:35:55.693
<i>I know your memory
will come back soon.</i>

01:35:58.190 --> 01:36:00.424
<i>When it does,</i>

01:36:01.922 --> 01:36:04.380
<i>remember I love you.</i>

01:36:05.305 --> 01:36:11.428
