WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.069
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
ELIZABETH:
<i> You have a wife, Robert. </i>

00:04.071 --> 00:05.437
We can never be together.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.606
Leith!

00:07.608 --> 00:09.008
Claude!

00:09.010 --> 00:11.010
Her fear of me actually
helped you land her?

00:11.012 --> 00:12.511
<i> Admit it, Stephan.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:14.613
NARCISSE:<i> I did no such thing. </i>
<i> You and I are so alike.</i>

00:14.615 --> 00:17.349
<i> You'll miss me,</i>
<i> she'll judge you,</i>

00:17.351 --> 00:20.486
and in so doing
miss the best parts of you.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.188
Francis.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.157
Promise me
that you'll stay in France

00:25.159 --> 00:27.192
until the future king is safe

00:27.194 --> 00:29.161
and my mother
is secured as regent.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.196
I will, I promise. I promise.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.800
NICHOLAS:
<i> Francis' death leaves Mary</i>

00:34.802 --> 00:36.402
<i> alone and vulnerable.</i>

00:39.373 --> 00:42.074
(horses neighing)

00:50.151 --> 00:52.251
(horses neighing)

00:56.557 --> 00:59.158
Francis' horse is magnificent.

00:59.160 --> 01:02.327
Yes, he is.

01:02.329 --> 01:05.197
It's been three weeks,

01:05.199 --> 01:07.332
but I still have
to remind myself each morning

01:07.334 --> 01:10.069
that he's gone,
that I am king.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.703
I envied the bond
you two shared.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.238
I came to Francis as a brother,

01:13.240 --> 01:15.407
free from politics or agenda.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.810
A king needs
that kind of support.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.779
I'd like to be a brother
to you, too.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.348
GRENIER:
Sebastian.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.317
Lord Grenier.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.119
How's the harvest season
treating your grapes?

01:27.121 --> 01:29.088
We've enjoyed
a cool autumn.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.622
The castle's
collective thirst

01:30.624 --> 01:32.191
should be quenched
for another year.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.643
How was the ride?

01:33.644 --> 01:35.094
We took the shortcut just west
of the river as you suggested.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.462
Wonderful.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.197
Tomorrow I shall
take you out myself.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.199
I'm not sure
that's appropriate.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.500
I don't see why not.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.335
I am a member
of the king's privy council.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.704
But it's customary
to suspend government business

01:45.706 --> 01:47.139
until after the coronation.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.274
I would hardly
call this business.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.510
(dog whines)

01:51.512 --> 01:54.246
GRENIER:
He has an impressive pedigree.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.815
There's not a fox in France

01:56.817 --> 01:59.485
that can match the speed
of this dog.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.587
What's his name?
That's entirely up to you.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.722
A gift from the council.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.758
In hopes of expressing
our eagerness to work together.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.228
I'm heading out for a hunt.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.230
Shall we see what he can do?

02:11.232 --> 02:12.598
Another time.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.800
Your loss, brother.

02:17.905 --> 02:21.240
Has the council begun discussing
candidates for the regency?

02:21.242 --> 02:23.175
My late brother had hoped
Catherine de Medici

02:23.177 --> 02:24.743
would be installed
in the position.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.246
That's of no concern
to a king's deputy.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.747
But thank you for
looking out for Charles.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.717
We're all in this together.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.488
Mary?

02:36.490 --> 02:37.923
Francis' things.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.491
Where would you
like them?

02:43.764 --> 02:45.330
Consult with the steward

02:45.332 --> 02:47.166
and find a place to store
the king's clothes.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.234
Nothing should be disposed
of without my knowledge.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.205
MARY:
Wait.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.408
Not that one.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.645
Francis wore it at our wedding.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.683
Off with you.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.251
All of you, now.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.221
(sniffles)
Greer, I'm fine.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.323
(door closes)
Mary, you're not fine.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.958
You just lost the man you love,

03:12.960 --> 03:14.660
and now they're moving you
to a lesser room.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.562
Treating the queen
of Scotland like she's...

03:16.564 --> 03:18.530
An outsider?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.566
That's because I am.

03:20.568 --> 03:24.236
Greer, it's been three weeks
since Francis died.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.305
I may still be a queen,

03:26.307 --> 03:28.740
but I am no longer
the queen of France.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.275
(door opens)

03:30.277 --> 03:31.510
Mary.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.979
I think we have a problem.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.246
BASH:
<i> Catherine's still not herself,</i>

03:35.249 --> 03:36.782
<i> when she most needs to be.</i>

03:36.784 --> 03:38.750
MARY:
Catherine.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.220
It's well past noon.

03:41.222 --> 03:44.423
Helene says you haven't
left your chambers.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.857
I wake with the sun.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.559
I do every day.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.262
I wash and I dress.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.631
Perhaps you would find some
comfort in the music room,

03:52.633 --> 03:55.334
practicing virginals,
or the chapel.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.568
How can I pray to a god

03:56.570 --> 03:58.370
when I'm certain
he does not hear me?

03:58.372 --> 04:00.272
We are all lost right now.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.641
But we must try to remember
that Francis

04:02.643 --> 04:04.343
saw a future for all of us.

04:04.345 --> 04:07.446
And yours was bright
and powerful as regent.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.014
While you've been distracted
by your grief,

04:09.016 --> 04:11.016
the privy council has been
meeting without you.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.851
Three times
in the last week.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.354
Charles is too young to rule
or fend for himself...

04:15.356 --> 04:17.356
and you are the queen mother.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.324
Until the privy council
elects a new regent,

04:19.326 --> 04:21.026
you must be present

04:21.028 --> 04:22.995
for all transitional
government assemblies.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.529
They have another candidate?

04:24.531 --> 04:26.265
BASH:
And the vote
is only weeks away.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.899
Lord Grenier has been
cozying up to Charles,

04:27.901 --> 04:29.635
wooing him with gifts.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.970
Whoever wins
will need Charles' support.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.805
Lord Grenier knows
that a king and his regent

04:33.807 --> 04:36.308
can't work together
without an established trust.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.343
We think Grenier is angling
himself for the position.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.378
Why do you want to help me?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.346
The first thing
I would do

04:41.348 --> 04:44.316
as regent is pull the French
troops from Scotland,

04:44.318 --> 04:46.485
end the reckless war

04:46.487 --> 04:49.888
that Francis sustained purely
out of his love for you.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.523
My election could
mean the end

04:51.525 --> 04:53.525
of your nation.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.360
You know that.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.828
I have no power
in France,

04:56.830 --> 04:59.898
I am widowed and alone.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.435
But I am staying
to fight for your future

05:03.437 --> 05:05.671
because I made my husband
a promise.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.506
Francis forgave you
because he knew

05:07.508 --> 05:09.675
you were the only
choice for regent,

05:09.677 --> 05:12.010
one who could secure
his brother's reign.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.945
There's not a single noble
on the council

05:13.947 --> 05:15.847
that'd be willing
to vote for me.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.316
Not yet.

05:17.318 --> 05:20.352
But you cannot
lose this battle.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.586
Catherine, please,

05:21.588 --> 05:23.989
no one is more focused
than you are

05:23.991 --> 05:26.091
on keeping Charles
on that throne.

05:26.093 --> 05:29.695
You must claim what is yours,
for your sons.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.698
¶ ¶

05:32.700 --> 05:34.833
She destroyed it?

05:34.835 --> 05:37.602
That accord
was a mutual agreement

05:37.604 --> 05:39.971
between nations for peace.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.540
And in exchange, Mary agreed

05:41.542 --> 05:44.976
to give up her claim
to my throne.

05:44.978 --> 05:50.115
But now her husband is dead,
her power diminished.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.617
She'll never relinquish
her right to my crown.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.953
A widowed Mary is less
of a threat than ever.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.555
For now.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.357
But a widowed Mary
is also a wild card.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.392
She could return home,
bolstering Scotland

06:00.394 --> 06:02.394
or seek a new
marriage alliance.

06:02.396 --> 06:05.564
Had you succeeded, my
rule would be protected.

06:05.566 --> 06:09.368
Instead, my cousin remains
a threat to me forever.

06:09.370 --> 06:13.705
Mary's ability to bewitch
men is well known.

06:15.409 --> 06:18.043
I've never given you reason
to doubt my loyalty.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.945
No.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.613
Not until now.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.549
I'm calling an emergency
session of the council.

06:24.551 --> 06:28.053
My troops will march on
Linlithgow immediately.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.088
Linlithgow.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.724
Mary's birthplace?

06:32.726 --> 06:35.660
I hope you don't feel
too sorry for her.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.396
(door opens)

06:38.599 --> 06:41.500
So, has Lord Dudley
returned to court?

06:41.502 --> 06:43.068
No, Your Majesty.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.603
He remains at his family
home in Norfolk

06:44.605 --> 06:46.004
and ignores our
every summons.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.407
And you made it clear
I must see him?

06:48.409 --> 06:49.941
As his queen?

06:49.943 --> 06:51.743
Our last visit found
his wife unattended.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.479
Sir Robert is away
on business at the coast.

06:54.481 --> 06:57.482
Hmm.

06:57.484 --> 07:00.919
Perhaps I extended my invitation
to the wrong Dudley.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.193
ELIZABETH:
I've asked you here

07:08.195 --> 07:10.195
because I'm in need
of your services

07:10.197 --> 07:11.596
in a new position at court.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.498
Keeper of the Swans.
It will require

07:13.500 --> 07:16.468
you return to your rooms
at the castle permanently.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.570
I've heard swans are vicious,
awful creatures.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.739
What is it that makes me
qualified

07:20.741 --> 07:23.708
for such a distinguished title?

07:23.710 --> 07:26.211
(horses neighing outside)

07:26.213 --> 07:28.013
How did you make him
come back to you?

07:28.015 --> 07:30.182
I am his wife.

07:30.184 --> 07:31.616
We're bound by God.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.018
He loves it here
at court.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.686
His life is here at court,

07:34.688 --> 07:36.955
not on some family farm
he cares little about.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.458
What did you say
to him, Amy,

07:39.460 --> 07:41.193
to convince him to leave?

07:41.195 --> 07:43.195
I'm sure
he'll tell you himself.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.063
That's why I'm here,
isn't it?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.032
Because I can't turn down a
position given by my queen.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.467
And as my husband,
at some point

07:48.469 --> 07:49.935
Robert will have to return.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.736
To me.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.472
To you.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.808
Welcome home, Amy.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.847
(Grenier speaking low,
indistinctly)

08:06.253 --> 08:08.220
My Grace.
Majesty.

08:08.222 --> 08:09.521
Catherine.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.189
My condolences.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.625
I don't need your condolences,
I need your cooperation.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.861
My son is a child,
but he is still your king,

08:15.863 --> 08:17.829
and he should be
represented here.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.165
Well, this meeting
is merely informal.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.701
The council can't make
any political decisions

08:22.703 --> 08:24.536
until a new regent
is elected.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.571
Then why gather at all?

08:26.573 --> 08:28.640
Uh...

08:31.245 --> 08:34.012
Either I am a fragile,
wilting female

08:34.014 --> 08:37.516
meant only to mourn,
or a power-grabbing harpy.

08:37.518 --> 08:40.552
Lord Grenier seemed
very confident,

08:40.554 --> 08:42.053
as if he'd already won,

08:42.055 --> 08:44.089
even though the vote
is still weeks away.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.258
Why?
He recently sold off

08:46.260 --> 08:48.660
one of his most profitable
vineyards.

08:48.662 --> 08:53.665
Perhaps he's using the money
to bribe the council.

08:53.667 --> 08:57.002
Grenier wants to see to it
that I have no power at court.

08:57.004 --> 09:00.539
And right now, he and the nobles
have the upper hand.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.775
Mary, Francis was wrong
to burden you with my future.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.977
Can't you see that I've lost?

09:05.979 --> 09:07.979
Failing Francis
is not an option.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.116
If you can't fight,

09:11.118 --> 09:13.184
then I will fight them for you.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.125
I missed you.

09:20.127 --> 09:24.329
I wish I could have been
at your side at the funeral.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.932
Catherine deserved the
time to mourn her son

09:26.934 --> 09:29.935
without my throwing our
happy marriage in her face.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.703
That doesn't mean
I'm not still anxious

09:31.705 --> 09:33.104
about her coming after us.

09:33.106 --> 09:37.075
Well, the land deals I've made

09:37.077 --> 09:39.778
to secure a seat on the council
are almost finalized,

09:39.780 --> 09:42.681
so... soon.

09:44.217 --> 09:47.953
Stephan, we've already
wasted half the day.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.922
Well, I would not call
time spent in pursuit

09:50.924 --> 09:53.825
of mutual carnal
satisfaction a waste.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.126
Mm-hmm.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.930
Tell me, do you have
any fantasies?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.132
None that come to mind.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.803
Do you?
Of course.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.638
"Of course"? What do
you mean, "of course?"

10:06.640 --> 10:08.006
Don't worry.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.308
They all involve you,
my beautiful wife.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.912
Perhaps it's time

10:13.914 --> 10:16.114
we broadened
our erotic horizons.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.851
We had a somewhat
non-traditional courtship,

10:19.853 --> 10:23.288
and I think part of that
is what intrigued you.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.958
And now we're married,
which is excitement enough.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.294
I see.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.197
Show me.
Show you?

10:33.867 --> 10:37.068
You want something
from me, take it.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.271
Be the aggressor.
I think you'll quite like it.

10:40.273 --> 10:44.009
I think it would
make me feel a bit...

10:44.011 --> 10:46.811
Yes?
Masculine.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.114
A bit like a
working girl even.

10:49.116 --> 10:52.417
After a long day
of cajoling other nobles,

10:52.419 --> 10:55.253
taking what I can,
building our fortune...

10:57.824 --> 11:00.859
...I come home to you
exhausted, Lola,

11:00.861 --> 11:04.029
and it would be nice to know,
on occasion,

11:04.031 --> 11:06.431
that you want me
as much as I want you.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.333
I do.

11:08.335 --> 11:12.003
I simply don't feel comfortable
with what you're asking.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.807
Of course... my darling.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.919
Elizabeth has taken Linlithgow.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.788
How?

11:29.790 --> 11:32.023
Well, the French forces
were already outnumbered

11:32.025 --> 11:34.059
in the Northeast.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.127
They didn't have time to summon
reinforcements. The generals

11:36.129 --> 11:38.797
are in a holding pattern
until a new regent is elected.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.132
What will you do?
There's nothing I can do.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.102
I have no command over
the French forces.
Then go home.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.904
Mary, take back our country.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.372
I am bound to
France for a reason.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.940
Catherine needs me.

11:48.942 --> 11:52.143
There is... another way.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.312
There are suitors
eager to court you--

11:54.314 --> 11:56.981
Charles of Austria,
the earl of Arran,

11:56.983 --> 11:58.283
even Prince Don Carlos of Spain.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.785
You need funds
to protect Scotland.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.487
Men are defined by their money,
and we both know

12:02.489 --> 12:05.123
that Spain has
the most of it.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.226
Don't you think I know that an
alliance is the best choice?

12:08.228 --> 12:10.361
I'm just not ready
to marry another man.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.997
I may never be.
You have to be.

12:12.999 --> 12:16.334
Helping Catherine is noble,
but it's also an excuse

12:16.336 --> 12:18.002
to put off the inevitable.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.904
Greer, what did you say
about Don Carlos?

12:19.906 --> 12:22.006
That Spain is the wealthiest
nation in Europe.

12:22.008 --> 12:25.176
And men are defined
by their money.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.946
(door opens)
LEITH:
You called for me, Princess?

12:27.948 --> 12:30.215
I'd like to ride
into the village tomorrow.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.750
I'm told there's
a peasant's shrine

12:31.752 --> 12:34.052
to my brother's memory
at the chapel.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.920
I'll see that the
carriage is ready.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.857
Good morning,
Alexandra.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.458
Is it?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.963
What happened there?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.965
The last time I saw
you two together, she was quite

12:46.967 --> 12:49.801
naked and keen on you.
Alexandra and
I are finished.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.103
She said I was distracted,
sensed I had feelings

12:52.105 --> 12:56.107
for another... for you.

12:56.109 --> 13:00.111
These feelings might
have been reciprocated,

13:00.113 --> 13:03.047
had I not walked in
on you with another girl.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.349
It's just as well.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.151
I have learned it is
best to know my place.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.019
I am a kitchen servant

13:08.021 --> 13:10.155
who a benevolent king took
a liking to, nothing more.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.257
Leith, things are changing.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.292
<i>France</i> is changing.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.162
Even Francis wouldn't have
thought me worthy of a princess.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.965
You're right... and I'm sorry.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.302
But what if I could help?

13:24.304 --> 13:27.172
There's a girl
coming to court.
Claude. No.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.174
The daughter
of the alderman of Lyon.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.842
Her family is just high enough.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.845
You are trying to
arrange a union for me.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.213
Isn't that a bit odd?

13:35.215 --> 13:37.215
It could raise your station.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.317
Why do you want to help me?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.319
Because you're going
to end up with someone.

13:41.321 --> 13:45.323
Why not someone a step above,
but within reach?

13:45.325 --> 13:48.193
There's a reception next week

13:48.195 --> 13:51.062
to welcome the
alderman to court.

13:51.064 --> 13:54.232
Come. We have work to do.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.075
Mary, what are you doing?

14:04.077 --> 14:05.844
I was looking for something.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.912
Something that
belonged to Francis.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.348
I'm sorry. I know this
is your study now.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.317
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

14:12.319 --> 14:15.086
There's something you need
to know about Lord Grenier.

14:15.088 --> 14:18.289
Charles, I know you
were fond of him.
Fond of him?

14:18.291 --> 14:19.490
Grenier thinks I'm a child

14:19.492 --> 14:21.359
whose allegiance
can be bought with gifts.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.996
So you're not going to
support him for the regency?

14:24.998 --> 14:27.031
Charles, why didn't
you come to me?

14:27.033 --> 14:29.467
I wanted to handle
Grenier myself.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.270
But I was wrong, Mary.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.573
They're moving up the vote
for the regency.
What?

14:35.575 --> 14:38.042
They can't do that!
Yes, they can.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.178
Queen Elizabeth has
taken Linlithgow.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.579
But I can't do anything,

14:41.581 --> 14:43.982
we can't do anything,
without a regent.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.516
Hundreds of our
men are dying.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.253
The vote is an emergency effort
to get them home.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.622
And Lord Grenier has positioned
himself as the front-runner.

14:50.624 --> 14:53.524
He's running
on a platform of peace.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.294
Grenier will pull every last
French soldier from Scotland.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.029
I know that's not
what you want to hear.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.632
Charles, what I want is for
Catherine to win that vote.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.233
What do you want?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.668
Francis was right.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.504
My mother is the only person
who wants to be regent

15:06.506 --> 15:09.674
in order to protect me,
my reign.

15:09.676 --> 15:13.378
She's the one
I need at my side.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.213
Then we have
to stop Grenier.
How?!

15:15.215 --> 15:16.948
I'm a king with no real power.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.117
But this is
your study.

15:19.119 --> 15:23.254
And you do have access to all
of the nobles' bank records.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.156
That's why I'm here.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.392
Lord Grenier recently
sold his biggest vineyard.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.427
Why would he need
that much money?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.529
Help me find out.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.403
"Keeper of the Swans." Really?

15:38.405 --> 15:40.405
I summoned Amy back because
I knew you'd have to follow.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.173
Don't you think
I know that?

15:42.175 --> 15:44.442
Did you think I'd let
you run away from me?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.411
Recommit to your wife
without explanation?

15:46.413 --> 15:49.013
Just let us go, Elizabeth.

15:49.015 --> 15:50.949
Release Amy.

15:50.951 --> 15:54.118
I was ready to tell you
Don Carlos is gone,

15:54.120 --> 15:55.486
that I will never marry.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.422
I thought that's
what you wanted, too.

15:57.424 --> 16:00.325
What did Amy do to
change your mind?

16:00.327 --> 16:04.028
She knows about us.
Of course she does.
I told you that.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.697
No, I told her that I love you.

16:05.699 --> 16:08.266
And she lashed out, accused you
of taking other lovers.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.467
She shamed me.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.536
All lies.
I couldn't bare it.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.172
And Elizabeth, I...

16:14.174 --> 16:16.241
I almost killed her.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.309
I had my hands around her neck,
and she forgave me

16:18.311 --> 16:20.011
for all of it.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.280
I can't keep living
in shame, Elizabeth.

16:22.282 --> 16:25.016
I can't keep wanting something
that I will never really have.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.419
We are over.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.356
I won't release you.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.224
You don't have a choice.
Nor do you.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.459
You love me, Robert.
Stop it.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.327
You nearly choked Amy

16:36.329 --> 16:38.196
because you hate her.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.431
Her very existence means
you can't have me.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.300
That's not true.
And you will hate her

16:42.302 --> 16:44.402
even more if you
turn your back on us.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.603
You will die miserable.

16:45.605 --> 16:49.140
Miserable and alone.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.409
And so will I.

16:57.450 --> 17:01.452
We can't do this.
Then tell me how to stop.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.603
You're back.

17:18.605 --> 17:22.473
Yes. And I've sent
for the rest of our things.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.709
We are back because
she commands it, because she is

17:24.711 --> 17:26.644
our queen.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.247
I know you're not happy
about it, Amy, but I think

17:29.249 --> 17:31.716
it's for best that we don't
discuss Elizabeth any further.

17:39.426 --> 17:43.461
(moaning, panting)

17:57.444 --> 17:58.843
Kindly untangle yourselves.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.712
(gasps)
This room is off-limits
to all servants,

18:01.714 --> 18:04.649
never mind those engaging
in that particular activity.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.685
You're
dismissed.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.592
Your name?

18:14.594 --> 18:15.827
Christophe.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.195
I'm a valet de chambre.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.396
I tend the castle's fires.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.565
I advise you to
exercise discretion.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.467
I prefer
to practice my scales free

18:22.469 --> 18:24.469
from the accompanying
lecherous moans.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.371
Are you sure
about that?

18:27.373 --> 18:29.674
As you wish.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.246
MARY:
<i> The bank records offered</i>
<i> no evidence</i>

18:35.248 --> 18:37.215
<i> that Lord Grenier has been</i>
<i> bribing the privy council.</i>

18:37.217 --> 18:38.449
<i> But he has sold</i>

18:38.451 --> 18:40.718
not one but five
of his vineyards.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.321
Then he's in
financial trouble?
No.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.157
He throws his money around
more than any noble at court.

18:46.159 --> 18:50.161
Your network of... employees
at the castle has grown.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.896
Can one
of your more highborn girls

18:51.898 --> 18:53.498
perhaps seduce her way
to the information

18:53.500 --> 18:55.900
I need?
It may prove
difficult.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.302
Grenier is in
a sexless marriage. Many whisper

18:58.304 --> 19:00.171
that he is immune to
the charms of women.

19:00.173 --> 19:03.574
Perhaps if I had a stable full
of strapping male whores.

19:03.576 --> 19:07.311
And Lady Grenier? Has she taken
someone on the side?
No.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.314
She spent every waking moment
with the duchess of Anjou
until very recently.

19:10.316 --> 19:13.718
The duchess was forced to leave
court by command of her husband.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.220
Lady Grenier has been
inconsolable ever since.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.391
Find someone
to comfort Lady Grenier,

19:20.393 --> 19:22.827
and I have my suspicions
she will spill

19:22.829 --> 19:25.229
her husband's every secret.
But I don't

19:25.231 --> 19:27.865
have a stable full
of strapping male whores.
I think

19:27.867 --> 19:31.402
a woman might do the trick
quite nicely.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.905
(exhaling)

19:38.678 --> 19:40.411
Melancholia.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.547
A common affliction.

19:42.549 --> 19:46.551
There are too many women
whose, um-- pardon me--

19:46.553 --> 19:49.887
sexual appetites
go unsatisfied.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.190
Does your husband
neglect you?

19:52.192 --> 19:53.758
Mmm.

19:53.760 --> 19:58.396
And yet what would I be
without him?

19:58.398 --> 20:01.399
I can recommend
a course of treatment.

20:01.401 --> 20:05.236
I had something else in mind.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.372
Something to help me regain
Lord Dudley's affections.

20:08.374 --> 20:12.210
If you were to offer
a different diagnosis,

20:12.212 --> 20:14.545
I know that I could
save my marriage.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.380
Madam, I am a man of science.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.715
And a lonely one,
from what I've heard.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.350
I'm sorry about the
loss of your wife.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.286
I'm lonely, too.
And my...

20:22.288 --> 20:24.622
sexual appetites
are healthy and raging.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.325
(panting)

20:30.396 --> 20:32.230
Perhaps we can arrange

20:32.232 --> 20:36.267
a mutually beneficial exchange
of services?

20:36.269 --> 20:37.969
A hidden mass?
We've found

20:37.971 --> 20:40.404
that stress and bad humors

20:40.406 --> 20:42.506
can exacerbate the condition,

20:42.508 --> 20:45.643
lead the tumor to consume
the patient from the inside.

20:45.645 --> 20:49.814
Has she suffered from anxiety
of late, excessive worry?

20:51.951 --> 20:53.584
Amy, I'm so sorry.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.785
I did this

20:54.787 --> 20:56.420
to you, didn't I?

20:58.391 --> 21:01.425
This isn't your doing.
I know you love me.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.927
You always have.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.395
You said yourself
you want us

21:04.397 --> 21:06.430
to remain
healthy, strong.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.500
Doctor, is there a cure?

21:09.502 --> 21:11.569
No cure, per se.
But there is hope.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.004
First, you must do
what you can

21:13.006 --> 21:14.505
to remove the cause
of any tension

21:14.507 --> 21:16.674
from her daily life.
As for treatment,

21:16.676 --> 21:18.276
I have a colleague
in Cornwall

21:18.278 --> 21:20.911
who has made great strides.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.046
Cornwall?
But I
would advise

21:22.048 --> 21:24.682
that you leave
as soon as possible.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.318
Doctor, I am a member of the
queen's privy council. I have

21:27.320 --> 21:28.786
many responsibilities here.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.322
Our Elizabeth is a benevolent
ruler. She would never

21:31.324 --> 21:33.891
begrudge a man the chance
to save the life of his beloved.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.927
I'll leave you to
discuss the options.

21:49.442 --> 21:52.376
My lady.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.782
Pretend
I'm Juliet.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.550
Wrong.
Hiding one's hands

21:59.552 --> 22:00.985
is considered suspicious.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.453
You could be holding
a dagger

22:02.455 --> 22:04.088
or waiting for just
the right moment to poison

22:04.090 --> 22:06.324
a tablemate's goblet
of wine.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.725
I'm going to poison someone?

22:07.727 --> 22:08.893
These are royals.

22:08.895 --> 22:11.362
Perhaps this isn't
the best idea.

22:11.364 --> 22:13.497
How is your allemande?
Your canary?

22:13.499 --> 22:15.566
They don't teach us those dances
in the village.

22:15.568 --> 22:18.336
At the very least,
you must learn lavolta.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.805
It opens with
a galliard.

22:20.807 --> 22:25.343
¶ ¶

22:28.748 --> 22:31.115
(sighs)

22:31.117 --> 22:33.918
Never mind then. Skip it.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.653
Next you circle each
other, like this.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.122
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.891
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.526
Until you come together
in the center.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.961
Then there's a lift.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.764
Lift me up, Leith.

22:46.766 --> 22:47.498
In the air.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.568
(grunting)
(squeals)

22:50.570 --> 22:51.669
(sighs)
(laughs)

22:51.671 --> 22:52.903
You're hopeless.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.372
Then forget lavolta.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.373
Let me show you what
they do teach us

22:55.375 --> 22:56.374
in the village.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.376
¶ ¶

23:01.381 --> 23:02.446
(claps)

23:02.448 --> 23:04.982
May I have this dance?

23:08.688 --> 23:12.156
¶ ¶

23:12.158 --> 23:14.525
(chuckling)

23:18.698 --> 23:21.031
(laughing)

23:23.136 --> 23:26.971
Cornwall. How will
we ever see each other?

23:26.973 --> 23:28.973
We won't.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.976
Cornwall is Amy's best
chance of survival.

23:31.978 --> 23:35.713
She knows even now I would
rather be here, with you.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.481
She even offered to have
the treatment alone.

23:37.483 --> 23:39.483
Then let her.
No.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.852
If she died alone, it would
be the same as me killing her.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.621
So you're saying
it's over then.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.489
Us.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.193
This time
for good.

23:50.163 --> 23:52.630
(sniffling)

23:54.200 --> 23:57.668
You've decided
this is your fault.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.203
Amy's illness
is a tragedy.

23:59.205 --> 24:02.873
But perhaps it's fate sending us
a message.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.476
We can finally be together.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.478
We just have to wait long enough
for her...

24:07.480 --> 24:10.581
To die?
Do you hear yourself, Elizabeth?

24:10.583 --> 24:13.217
I'm only saying
what we're both thinking.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.719
If Amy dies, God
rest her soul,

24:15.721 --> 24:19.056
but you can return to me.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.058
I fear my soul would...

24:21.060 --> 24:23.494
be marked beyond repair.

24:23.496 --> 24:25.496
(sniffles)

24:31.971 --> 24:35.639
(sniffling)

24:35.641 --> 24:37.475
Good-bye, my love.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.743
(crying)

24:44.617 --> 24:47.551
As I had hoped, Lady Grenier
was rather chatty post-coital.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.954
Oh?
I know how to bring him down.

24:49.956 --> 24:55.025
And I guarantee you it will make
you feel more alive than ever.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.068
You're looking
well, Queen Mother.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.569
Leave us.

25:05.571 --> 25:08.172
Your plot against the Crown
is an affront to France,

25:08.174 --> 25:09.840
Lord Grenier.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.076
I found it all too easy
to rally my spirits.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.110
MARY:
We know about

25:13.112 --> 25:14.245
the emergency vote.

25:14.247 --> 25:16.680
If I win,

25:16.682 --> 25:19.617
I win by popular vote
of my peers.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.919
I can't think
of anything more fair than that.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.622
CATHERINE:
But your peers don't know
the truth, what you would do

25:24.624 --> 25:26.257
as regent of France.

25:26.259 --> 25:29.026
You've been selling off
vineyards.
My business

25:29.028 --> 25:32.263
is ever evolving.
The Crown has been struggling
to provide Scotland

25:32.265 --> 25:35.966
with more troops. Mercenary
armies are a valuable commodity.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.701
And you have quietly
become the largest,

25:37.703 --> 25:38.903
most secretive owner

25:38.905 --> 25:41.272
of mercenary armies
in the country.

25:41.274 --> 25:43.574
And if that were true,
it's not a crime.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.543
MARY:
No, but you've
turned a legal,

25:45.545 --> 25:48.145
profitable business practice
into an illegal,

25:48.147 --> 25:49.947
more profitable crime.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.783
you've been taking pay
from dead soldiers,

25:52.785 --> 25:54.218
Under-reporting
their numbers.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.620
CATHERINE: Profiting
from each life lost.

25:56.622 --> 25:58.923
How soon were you going to turn
on the council,

25:58.925 --> 26:01.625
doubling down on the
military presence in Scotland

26:01.627 --> 26:03.561
purely for personal gain?

26:03.563 --> 26:05.563
Your nation stands to
gain something, too.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.565
MARY: That's right.
But even I wouldn't condone

26:07.567 --> 26:09.667
deceiving the council
into taking an action

26:09.669 --> 26:12.236
that would harm France.
Then you're being
shortsighted.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.572
Scotland needs those troops.

26:14.574 --> 26:17.141
How dare you!
Posing as a loyal patriot,

26:17.143 --> 26:20.010
while taking advantage of
the king, my husband's death!

26:20.012 --> 26:22.046
You have no proof.
Let me stop you
before you

26:22.048 --> 26:23.814
waste your breath
insulting me.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.316
We have proof.

26:25.318 --> 26:27.985
The paper trail showing
your misdeeds was difficult

26:27.987 --> 26:31.322
to uncover, but Mary
has managed to do it.

26:31.324 --> 26:33.924
You will resign, or we will
expose you for who you are.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.225
MARY:
A war profiteer

26:35.227 --> 26:37.061
and a traitor to France.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.796
So you get
rid of me.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.032
What comes next?

26:42.034 --> 26:43.667
You have an endless
line of enemies

26:43.669 --> 26:45.669
who will do everything
they can to prevent you

26:45.671 --> 26:47.605
from gaining power.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.874
The council
despises you, Catherine.

26:50.876 --> 26:53.277
And a weakened,
grieving woman

26:53.279 --> 26:56.046
should never be permitted
to hold the reins of a nation.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.615
Guards!

26:59.185 --> 27:02.786
Thank you for your service
to the king.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.659
He's right.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.729
We will get you
those votes.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.831
No, Mary.

27:13.833 --> 27:17.401
A regent must honor
the will of the people...

27:17.403 --> 27:21.739
and bring the troops
home from Scotland.

27:21.741 --> 27:24.274
Leaving my country
nearly defenseless.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.176
Catherine, I know this.

27:26.178 --> 27:29.346
But it was Francis's dying
wish that I stand by you,

27:29.348 --> 27:31.815
and I will.
But I can't

27:31.817 --> 27:34.051
ask you to do that,
and I won't.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.120
I must honor my son.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.655
What do you mean?
(sighs)

27:37.657 --> 27:39.423
If I am regent, the
troops will remain--

27:39.425 --> 27:41.125
that's what
Francis would want;

27:41.127 --> 27:43.360
that's what my heart
would force me to do:

27:43.362 --> 27:46.730
protect the alliance,
keep your country safe.

27:46.732 --> 27:48.298
And unlike Grenier,

27:48.300 --> 27:49.800
the council will know
of my intentions.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.368
But if you don't
withdraw the troops,

27:51.370 --> 27:53.170
you could lose the regency.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.406
These past few days,
I have watched you rally

27:55.408 --> 27:56.707
for Francis's cause,

27:56.709 --> 27:58.676
honoring your promise
to help me,

27:58.678 --> 28:01.412
even at a great cost
to your own country.

28:01.414 --> 28:03.213
I always thought
that Francis was wrong

28:03.215 --> 28:04.915
to take on Scotland's burden,

28:04.917 --> 28:06.950
but it was his promise
to his wife,

28:06.952 --> 28:08.452
his declaration of love.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.454
I owe it to my son

28:10.456 --> 28:12.690
to take care of you the same way

28:12.692 --> 28:14.758
that he begged you
to take care of me.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.261
That's not a sacrifice
I can ask you to make.
No.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.796
But it is a sacrifice

28:18.798 --> 28:21.999
that Francis
would ask me to make.

28:23.469 --> 28:26.470
And it will be
my last act of mourning.

28:26.472 --> 28:30.074
Then there is only person
who can make this right...

28:30.076 --> 28:33.310
even if it costs me my country.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.285
Your sovereign king
has left us.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.454
But until a new regent
is elected,

28:43.456 --> 28:45.289
Francis's word remains law.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.157
I will admit...

28:47.159 --> 28:49.359
that does bring me comfort...

28:49.361 --> 28:52.996
as France's troops
have protected my people.

28:52.998 --> 28:55.799
But Catherine
has convinced me

28:55.801 --> 28:58.836
that I must allow France
to move to the future,

28:58.838 --> 29:01.105
in order to save
thousands of lives

29:01.107 --> 29:03.207
and the Crown's
perilous finances.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.509
Therefore...

29:05.511 --> 29:08.045
as the other half
of the alliance,

29:08.047 --> 29:10.247
I hereby...

29:10.249 --> 29:12.516
relieve France and her armies

29:12.518 --> 29:14.518
of their duty to Scotland.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.787
(happy shouts, cheers)

29:20.359 --> 29:22.893
The council meets tomorrow

29:22.895 --> 29:24.361
to discuss
our options.
Mm.

29:24.363 --> 29:25.929
We owe you
an audience.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.765
But there will
still be many

29:27.767 --> 29:29.833
who will oppose
your regency

29:29.835 --> 29:32.035
even after this
impactful victory.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.971
CATHERINE:
I will do my best
to remind them...

29:33.973 --> 29:37.941
(Catherine continues
indistinctly)

29:37.943 --> 29:40.911
¶ ¶

29:40.913 --> 29:43.080
COUNCILMAN: Your support
would go a long way

29:43.082 --> 29:44.481
toward legitimizing
your mother.

29:44.483 --> 29:47.317
How would you feel about her
ruling at your side?

29:47.319 --> 29:49.052
It would be a great comfort.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.357
You're learning.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.495
Word is Grenier fled,

29:58.497 --> 30:00.864
and quickly.
Thank you.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.334
Mary, what will you do next?

30:05.938 --> 30:08.405
I came here
when I was six years old.

30:08.407 --> 30:11.441
I barely remember Scotland.

30:11.443 --> 30:14.511
It's romanticized,
a picture in my mind.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.581
The truth is...

30:17.583 --> 30:19.583
France has always
been my home.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.952
I threw myself
into helping you

30:21.954 --> 30:24.955
because it meant
that I could stay.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.524
Now there is nothing
but Scotland.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.194
And the hope of a new alliance.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.095
Don Carlos.

30:32.097 --> 30:35.165
You were right to suggest
I consider him.
Mm.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.968
I can't stay here
and sustain my rule.

30:37.970 --> 30:41.004
But how can I wed another?
You will because you must.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.907
I don't even know who I am
without Francis.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.275
You are a queen.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.311
Still a queen.

30:47.313 --> 30:50.314
(crying):
I loved him, Catherine.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.850
(sniffles)
And now it's done.

30:52.852 --> 30:55.185
And I loved him.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.889
¶ ¶

30:58.891 --> 31:01.024
(continues crying)

31:02.895 --> 31:05.028
NICHOLAS:
<i> Mary has released the troops.</i>

31:05.030 --> 31:06.530
They're going
back to France.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.131
Linlithgow
has fallen.

31:08.133 --> 31:10.868
Perhaps I should take
all of Scotland as my own.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.436
Scotland harbors
many Protestants.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.872
But they are still Scotsman;
they will turn against you.

31:14.874 --> 31:17.007
Mary is widowed
and heartbroken,

31:17.009 --> 31:19.076
yet has brought herself
to do the right thing.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.111
You should follow
her example.

31:21.113 --> 31:25.115
I have no interest in continuing
this unsustainable war.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.050
You don't trust me.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.652
Not anymore.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.287
I'm afraid not.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.990
You've taken a
liking to my cousin.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.959
Then perhaps I'm not the man
to represent you in France.

31:35.961 --> 31:38.629
And who would you
suggest to replace you?

31:38.631 --> 31:40.130
Never mind.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.933
I have just the
man for the job--

31:42.935 --> 31:46.970
the antithesis of your
theoretical undying loyalty:

31:46.972 --> 31:48.472
Gideon Blackburn.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.507
No. Blackburn is spending
his life in the Tower

31:50.509 --> 31:52.042
for a reason.
And yet

31:52.044 --> 31:54.311
everything that makes him
reprehensible

31:54.313 --> 31:58.415
is exactly what I need
to take down the queen of Scots.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.921
Catherine.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.155
Leave us.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.059
I'd like to put on
my trousers.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.061
Nothing I haven't
seen before.

32:11.063 --> 32:14.264
I've come because
I was recently reminded
of something important.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.234
Even at my lowest of lows...

32:17.236 --> 32:19.369
I'm stronger
than my enemies.

32:19.371 --> 32:23.206
An admirable quality,
given that you have so many.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.042
I hope you've enjoyed
your brief union

32:25.044 --> 32:28.011
with Lola's supple skin
and absent wit.

32:28.013 --> 32:32.082
Because I plan to wreak havoc
on all you hold dear

32:32.084 --> 32:34.685
the moment I become
regent of France.

32:34.687 --> 32:37.187
Congratulations on
your recent victory.

32:37.189 --> 32:40.290
I never counted you out.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.694
But do you really think
that I would make home

32:43.696 --> 32:47.731
here at court without
putting some basic
protections in place?

32:47.733 --> 32:50.233
What are you getting at?
Your grandson John

32:50.235 --> 32:53.103
was gifted several parcels
of land by Francis.

32:53.105 --> 32:56.440
I wisely spent my honeymoon
adding to those holdings.

32:56.442 --> 32:59.109
In fact, the last
of the deeds arrived

32:59.111 --> 33:00.610
just this afternoon.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.046
And as John's
guardian and proxy...

33:03.048 --> 33:05.615
You have a seat
on the privy council.

33:05.617 --> 33:06.550
Yes.

33:07.519 --> 33:08.752
I'm warning you, Stephan.

33:08.754 --> 33:10.687
You're in no position
to warn me.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.057
You don't have the votes.

33:14.059 --> 33:15.525
I'll get them, all of them.

33:15.527 --> 33:19.529
Meanwhile, I am friendly
with nobles on both sides.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.098
Back with your old cronies.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.299
Happily.

33:22.301 --> 33:24.334
And if I've done
my maths correctly,

33:24.336 --> 33:27.571
I hold the casting vote.

33:27.573 --> 33:30.507
So... perhaps
you want to stop your threats

33:30.509 --> 33:33.343
and release your grip...

33:33.345 --> 33:36.113
or finish the job.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.426
If I'm to impress
the visiting Juliet,

33:49.428 --> 33:51.228
I'll have to talk to her,
connect with her.

33:51.230 --> 33:54.131
I can't teach you
the art of conversation
in less than a week.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.232
You haven't even told me

33:55.234 --> 33:58.335
what this girl looks like.
Is she blonde?

33:58.337 --> 34:00.103
Brunette?

34:00.105 --> 34:02.072
You know I like
a ripe backside.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.042
Claude.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.344
There is no Juliet.

34:07.346 --> 34:10.180
I'm a member of
the royal guard--
how long did you think

34:10.182 --> 34:12.249
it would take me to find out
that there's no reception?

34:12.251 --> 34:13.784
Why did you lie?

34:13.786 --> 34:15.819
I wanted to spend time with you.

34:15.821 --> 34:18.188
Ever since I caught you
with Alexandra you've acted

34:18.190 --> 34:20.190
like I'm nothing more
than a work detail.

34:20.192 --> 34:22.492
I told you why I can't
be your friend, not anymore.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.062
Because we can't be
together. But I say we can.

34:25.064 --> 34:27.064
But Charles could marry you off
at a moment's notice.

34:27.066 --> 34:28.331
Who said anything
about marriage?

34:28.333 --> 34:30.167
Must you marry
every girl you kiss?

34:30.169 --> 34:32.302
Well, then I'm back to exactly
where I was with Greer.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.670
I am not Greer.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.439
You told me that
when you first

34:35.441 --> 34:37.307
met Greer, she was
on the hunt for a husband.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.209
A rich one,
with a title.

34:39.211 --> 34:40.610
But I'm different, Leith.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.512
I'm a princess.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.281
I need only to follow my heart.

34:45.517 --> 34:47.084
So who's to say that you

34:47.086 --> 34:48.718
won't be the one to break mine?

34:50.823 --> 34:53.256
Can't you just admit
that you want me, too?

34:54.526 --> 34:58.095
¶ Why do I fall ¶

34:59.832 --> 35:01.231
¶ For you? ¶

35:01.233 --> 35:03.166
(door opens)

35:05.604 --> 35:08.171
What's this?

35:08.173 --> 35:11.274
The queen herself paying a
visit to a common prisoner?

35:11.276 --> 35:13.877
You must need
something.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.613
A task that should come
all too easily,

35:16.615 --> 35:18.782
given your talents.

35:18.784 --> 35:22.185
You lied to me.

35:22.187 --> 35:24.387
You made me
care for you.

35:24.389 --> 35:26.156
You nearly made me...

35:26.158 --> 35:27.824
But I didn't.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.726
I couldn't make you
fall in love with me.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.461
Because you were in love
with Robert Dudley.

35:31.463 --> 35:34.164
Which you happily reported
back to my half-sister.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.199
I was a girl, Gideon.

35:36.201 --> 35:38.568
And Bloody Mary
was my queen.

35:38.570 --> 35:41.271
I was her eyes and ears,
sent to inform on you,

35:41.273 --> 35:42.906
the greatest threat
to her crown.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.342
And when she ripped Robert
from his cell and my arms,

35:45.344 --> 35:46.843
it nearly killed me.

35:46.845 --> 35:50.747
Weakening you
was a necessary precaution.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.916
A queen must always
be looking over her shoulder

35:52.918 --> 35:55.485
to those with the power
to undo her.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.754
I understand that now.

35:57.756 --> 36:00.157
That's why I'm here.

36:00.159 --> 36:04.161
Mary, Queen of Scots will soon
seek a marriage alliance.

36:04.163 --> 36:07.330
Spain's Prince Don Carlos is
among the interested candidates.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.199
Well, that union
would be quite the feather

36:09.201 --> 36:11.268
in your cousin's cap.
Yes.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.536
And one I'm eager to thwart.

36:12.538 --> 36:15.272
I hear Robert left court.

36:15.274 --> 36:17.874
The Lady Dudley
is quite ill.

36:17.876 --> 36:20.343
Is that why you're so eager to
bring down the queen of Scots?

36:20.345 --> 36:22.279
Robert has abandoned you,
you're bored

36:22.281 --> 36:23.880
without your little plaything?

36:23.882 --> 36:27.584
Mary has released the French
troops from Scotland.

36:27.586 --> 36:31.555
And a new alliance would raise
her international standing.

36:31.557 --> 36:34.691
That is something
I can't afford.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.394
And why would I agree
to help you?
To gain your freedom.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.696
Perhaps there's a part
of your blackened heart

36:39.698 --> 36:41.731
that longs to meet
your daughter.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.434
I've taken Agatha
in as my ward.

36:44.436 --> 36:48.305
Such a pity, a child growing up
with two absent parents.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.740
Do this for me
and I'll see you're reunited.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.943
And how do you suggest
I gain Mary's trust?

36:52.945 --> 36:54.411
By doing
what you do best.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.746
By doing
what you tried to do to me.

36:56.748 --> 36:59.649
Make Mary fall in love with you.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.521
You were spotted leaving
Lord Narcisse's chambers.

37:04.523 --> 37:08.225
I put a stop to the servants'
chatter, of course, but...

37:08.227 --> 37:11.394
Our encounter ended
with Lord Narcisse

37:11.396 --> 37:14.464
experiencing the kind of
pleasure I very much doubt

37:14.466 --> 37:17.300
he's enjoyed since
marrying Lady Lola.

37:17.302 --> 37:20.270
Queen Mother.
(door closes in distance)

37:20.272 --> 37:23.473
What he doesn't understand is
that I've found his weakness.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.508
A crack in his marriage.

37:25.510 --> 37:28.011
I'll use him to become regent

37:28.013 --> 37:31.348
and then I will lay waste
to his happiness.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.483
You are devious

37:33.485 --> 37:35.352
and brilliant.

37:35.354 --> 37:38.421
And yet he gets to share his bed
with a pretty young thing

37:38.423 --> 37:41.024
while I'm expected
to retire alone.

37:41.026 --> 37:44.361
But we can fix that,
can't we? Mm.

37:44.363 --> 37:47.397
(door opens)

37:47.399 --> 37:50.400
Mmm.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.469
That's lovely.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.539
The heat.

37:56.541 --> 37:59.276
Is there anything else
I can do?

38:00.545 --> 38:04.447
Yes. I have another fire
that needs lighting.

38:04.449 --> 38:05.815
Bring me back to life.

38:08.587 --> 38:11.321
¶ I hear the whisper call ¶

38:11.323 --> 38:13.690
¶ Calling me ¶

38:13.692 --> 38:16.493
¶ It's like a hell... ¶

38:16.495 --> 38:19.062
I thought about what you
said. About compromise.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.764
Lola.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.332
Let me finish.

38:22.334 --> 38:25.368
I have an idea of what
a proper wife should be,

38:25.370 --> 38:27.370
and, clearly,
it's very different from yours.

38:27.372 --> 38:30.307
But there's nothing
wrong with that.

38:30.309 --> 38:31.341
I will compromise.

38:31.343 --> 38:33.443
Please you when I can, but...

38:33.445 --> 38:36.346
It's all right, Lola.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.948
I probably shouldn't have asked.

38:38.950 --> 38:40.383
But tonight.
I thought that we...

38:40.385 --> 38:44.554
We should
get some rest.

38:44.556 --> 38:45.889
I've had quite a day.

38:47.059 --> 38:50.527
¶ We are not afraid ¶

38:50.529 --> 38:53.697
¶ We live again ¶

38:55.701 --> 38:58.401
It's fine, truly.

39:01.807 --> 39:04.741
How was your day?

39:04.743 --> 39:08.611
Filled with
unexpected surprises.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.814
Uh... all work related,

39:10.816 --> 39:12.549
I assure you.

39:12.551 --> 39:16.486
I won't bore you
with the politics.

39:16.488 --> 39:19.689
¶ We're untouchable ¶

39:22.494 --> 39:24.060
Mary, are you all right?

39:24.062 --> 39:25.729
No, I'm not.

39:25.731 --> 39:28.365
But my happiness is not
your responsibility, Charles.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.899
I disagree.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.001
Soon you'll be forced
to seek an alliance.

39:32.003 --> 39:34.070
You must bring everything
you have to the table

39:34.072 --> 39:36.773
in order to ensure the
most advantageous match.

39:36.775 --> 39:40.443
I was considering Don Carlos'
request for an audience.

39:40.445 --> 39:43.513
But the problem is I am
the queen of a besieged nation.

39:43.515 --> 39:46.483
I have no idea how
I'll be received in Scotland.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.485
My people support me,
but they don't know me

39:48.487 --> 39:50.453
as anything
other than a symbol.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.856
Spain would have the upper
hand in any negotiations.

39:52.858 --> 39:54.591
Not if you accept my help.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.395
Don't go back to Scotland.

39:58.397 --> 39:59.763
Charles.

39:59.765 --> 40:02.599
Court Don Carlos
or any other prospects here.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.601
We'll show Spain that you
will always have power

40:04.603 --> 40:06.636
as long as you are
aligned with France.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.471
That you will have
the House of Valois--

40:08.473 --> 40:09.672
the new king--
behind you.

40:09.674 --> 40:11.474
Forge a new marriage.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.042
In the home of my husband?

40:13.044 --> 40:15.412
In the country
that will always protect you.

40:19.518 --> 40:20.984
I know it may seem odd,

40:20.986 --> 40:23.486
but it's what Francis
would have wanted.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.146
Bernard.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.686
Find my favorite portrait.

40:56.688 --> 40:58.188
The one in the red gown.

40:58.190 --> 41:01.057
Send it to Don Carlos
with a message.

41:01.059 --> 41:03.960
I'm staying in France.
And I'm ready.
