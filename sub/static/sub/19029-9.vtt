00:00.956 --> 00:02.896
Since the geriatric wing was being remodeled,

00:02.906 --> 00:05.436
Turk were herding old people
to their new rooms.

00:05.637 --> 00:07.732
That's a closet, mr. Jenkins.

00:07.978 --> 00:12.013
Come on, mr. Benedetti, you're only a few thousand tiny steps away.

00:13.083 --> 00:16.158
JD, we need to find a way to
move these gomers faster.

00:18.946 --> 00:22.335
All aboard! The love train.

00:36.188 --> 00:39.077
That was a fun fantasy, I wish it didn't have to end.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.180
Hey...

00:42.484 --> 00:45.444
That's a nice jacket, Ted.

00:45.907 --> 00:48.861
- What is it, wool?
- It's a poly-nylon blend

00:48.871 --> 00:50.151
do you really like it?

00:50.473 --> 00:53.362
No. Bathroom's just put of paper towels.

00:56.430 --> 01:00.104
I know it's confusing, but these
are your new rooms, ok?

01:00.200 --> 01:03.565
Please, try to stay put. Great.

01:04.206 --> 01:05.152
Bye-bye.

01:07.669 --> 01:10.263
Since Elliot revealed that Dr.Kelso was 65,

01:10.274 --> 01:12.509
the board was forcing him
to retire in a few weeks.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.837
This is even worse than when they decided

01:14.848 --> 01:17.143
female staffers couldn't
wear open-toed shoes!

01:18.410 --> 01:20.305
Ob-obviously, this is much worse...

01:20.591 --> 01:21.904
but that sucked too.

01:22.258 --> 01:25.648
I feel like I've given my life to this
place and got nothing in return.

01:25.865 --> 01:29.004
I mean, is there an MRI machine
in my basement? Maybe.

01:29.621 --> 01:32.977
I guess I just wanted to end my
career on my own terms, you know?

01:33.320 --> 01:35.409
- Oh...
- We gotta help him save his job.

01:35.751 --> 01:37.919
- You guys are gonna help, right?
- Of course.

01:37.999 --> 01:39.551
First we gotta handle something.

01:40.261 --> 01:43.708
Dr. Cox had a patient that he couldn't
be able to diagnoaveva unse in two years.

01:44.415 --> 01:45.580
And he went back again.

01:46.185 --> 01:49.791
Look, Alex, I'm afraid I still don't
know what's causing all of this,

01:49.824 --> 01:52.980
so I'm gonna go ahead and treat your
heart palpitations with betablockers.

01:53.873 --> 01:57.263
Turk and I couldn't resist play the
little game called "poke the bear".

01:57.730 --> 02:00.920
Turk, yesterday I had this patient
I just could not diagnose.

02:01.055 --> 02:03.604
Wow, you must have felt like a real jackass.

02:03.614 --> 02:06.794
I did feel like a jackass, but then I was
able to figure out what was wrong with him,

02:06.805 --> 02:09.288
because I'm not a jackass, I'm a good doctor.

02:09.716 --> 02:12.574
Ok, now just stay calm, so he
doesn't know what you're up to.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.520
Oh, no, Turk's breaking!

02:15.794 --> 02:18.184
Quick, distract the bear with a casual greeting!

02:18.612 --> 02:20.808
Oh, hey Dr. Cox, how are things?

02:22.925 --> 02:25.496
My God, that was amazing. I never
felt so alive in my whole life.

02:25.637 --> 02:26.941
My heart stopped for a second.

02:26.963 --> 02:28.816
- We made it. I love you, man.
- I love you too.

02:28.887 --> 02:31.516
You smell like an athlete.

02:32.943 --> 02:34.999
- I need one of those.
- A hug?

02:35.310 --> 02:37.016
No, a black friend.

02:37.274 --> 02:39.312
I think it would make me much cooler.

02:39.506 --> 02:41.480
I should be offended, but he's right.

02:41.972 --> 02:43.204
Why are you so gloomy?

02:43.214 --> 02:46.132
I thought you'd be super-psyed that
Kelso's being forced out of his job.

02:46.390 --> 02:49.598
Dr. Kelso's being forced out?
I did not know that.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.094
Will you excuse me for a moment?

02:54.566 --> 02:58.815
I'm free! I'm free! I'm beautiful and I'm free!

02:58.867 --> 03:01.473
I'm free! Give me some sugar!

03:02.544 --> 03:06.132
It's finally over! I'm free!

03:08.562 --> 03:10.586
Holy cow! Buddy, are you all right?

03:12.565 --> 03:13.490
Ted?

03:15.280 --> 03:17.641
Are you not talking 'cause your
mouth is filling up with blood?

03:19.288 --> 03:21.853
You're gonna pass out, aren't you?
Oh, boy there he goes.

03:24.483 --> 03:25.318
Yipes!

03:42.506 --> 03:45.089
At certain times in our lives,
we all get introspective.

03:46.105 --> 03:47.601
Taking it all in, too?

03:48.233 --> 03:49.372
Why don't you have a seat, son?

03:49.819 --> 03:52.459
Actually, sir, uhm, my shift is
bout to start, so I should...

03:52.535 --> 03:55.235
Son, I don't care if the cure for cancer was laughter

03:55.259 --> 03:57.921
and you had Nipsey Russell
in your backpack. Parking!

03:59.401 --> 04:01.800
I'm gonna get all nostalgic, crap.

04:02.357 --> 04:04.644
What's that strange red puddle
loosing towards us?

04:04.765 --> 04:06.246
Oh, that's just Ted's blood.

04:06.735 --> 04:08.646
Apparently he bit of a chunk of his tongue.

04:09.082 --> 04:13.369
Anyway, when I started here, I was only 26.

04:16.325 --> 04:18.333
Aaaaand done!

04:18.858 --> 04:21.249
- 23 stitches.
- Here's some painkillers.

04:22.390 --> 04:25.704
I want to take one of those
every four hours, ok?

04:26.418 --> 04:28.007
No trying to talk.

04:28.546 --> 04:30.006
I keep thinking about Kelso.

04:30.411 --> 04:32.146
He reminds me
of my grandpa.

04:32.380 --> 04:35.191
He's pervy, demeaning,
and a tinsy bit racist,

04:35.214 --> 04:38.498
but you crave his love anyway,
because he smells like peppermint.

04:38.855 --> 04:41.566
I've always respected Kelso.
He's got a though job.

04:41.818 --> 04:44.804
And I bet deep down, everybody here
want us to help him keep it.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.257
Ted, no talking.

04:48.731 --> 04:50.197
We do know a board member.

04:54.938 --> 04:57.099
Why would anyone
wanna save Kelso's job ?

04:57.538 --> 05:01.289
- For starters... - You know what?
I don't honestly care one way or the other.

05:02.108 --> 05:04.106
- About Kelso?
- Or about anything.

05:04.165 --> 05:07.495
But then again, you two are
young enough and attractive enough

05:07.637 --> 05:10.523
that I'm not angry when people assume
we're friends, so what the hell?

05:10.868 --> 05:12.066
Here's what you do.

05:12.429 --> 05:14.199
Board members hate confrontation.

05:14.345 --> 05:15.899
There's a board meeting tonight.

05:16.175 --> 05:19.435
Just show up at the hospital, with all the
movers and shakers in support of Kelso,

05:19.658 --> 05:20.563
They'll cave.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.182
All right.

05:22.814 --> 05:25.747
Ok. I'll support Kelso.
But in return,

05:25.905 --> 05:28.184
I want you to put me in a full body
cast and take me to the airport.

05:28.384 --> 05:30.633
- I'll explain later.
- Why would we do that?

05:30.860 --> 05:34.605
Because I'm the bigger's mover/shaker
in this dump. Come on.

05:34.816 --> 05:36.417
You handle this.
And be nice.

05:37.359 --> 05:41.046
All right. Are you familiar
with the term "delusions of grandeur"?

05:41.472 --> 05:43.074
I believe I coined that term.

05:43.582 --> 05:45.708
look, I'm a simple, unassuming janitor

05:46.248 --> 05:48.444
who can control people's
actions with his mind.

05:49.146 --> 05:49.981
Observe.

05:51.127 --> 05:52.218
Explode!

05:54.599 --> 05:57.795
If that would have worked, it would
have freaked you out. You'd loved it!

05:58.426 --> 05:59.109
Fall.

06:02.543 --> 06:03.506
Hello?

06:06.258 --> 06:09.274
I think this might be the thousandth time
I've peed in a cup for you, doc.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.740
Well, then, to us.

06:13.196 --> 06:14.651
- Hard to celebrate?
- Yeah.

06:15.394 --> 06:16.304
I got it.

06:18.970 --> 06:22.359
Jeez Louise, can you believe
how many files I have on this guy?

06:22.418 --> 06:25.534
The only way I've been able to
bind them together was with this bi-bond.

06:25.557 --> 06:27.905
- Do you hang on that for a second, will you?
- Sure.

06:28.338 --> 06:30.780
I don't think he realized
we were making fun of him earlier.

06:31.195 --> 06:32.352
Say, what's up
your arm?

06:36.257 --> 06:37.244
Oh, boy.

06:42.429 --> 06:44.679
I'm sorry, dude,
that was awesome.

06:45.812 --> 06:47.271
Dr Cox we're sorry.

06:47.302 --> 06:50.109
Dont' worry tough. Turk and I are
gonna help you diagnose this patient.

06:50.307 --> 06:52.417
That's terrific,
because I'm so darn lost,

06:52.447 --> 06:55.485
I just keep procrastinating.
I check my emails,

06:55.606 --> 06:58.824
I pick up a copy of "House weekly"
to see which of my favorite celebs

06:58.855 --> 07:00.386
is bringing back the fedora.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.967
It's Johnny Depp,
by the way.

07:02.283 --> 07:04.696
- He doesn't think we could help.
- I look good in a fedora.

07:04.768 --> 07:06.307
Turk, focus. We're being insulted.

07:06.318 --> 07:09.375
I'm tired of your not focusing when
someone insults us. It ends up all on me.

07:09.839 --> 07:11.911
Hey, if you really wanna be useful

07:12.252 --> 07:15.152
make like an orderly and take
that urine sample down to the lab.

07:15.619 --> 07:16.537
Follow me.

07:20.087 --> 07:21.079
Money, right?

07:21.609 --> 07:23.994
How does it have anything
to do with what Dr. Cox said?

07:24.311 --> 07:25.748
What did Dr. Cox say?

07:27.357 --> 07:29.247
Good afternoon, Mr. Mandelbaum.

07:30.771 --> 07:32.464
Uhm, shouldn't we stop him?

07:33.145 --> 07:36.431
Nah, the security guard
will keep him out of traffic.

07:37.968 --> 07:38.932
You know,

07:39.121 --> 07:43.842
when I was an intern,
they made us work 60 hours shifts.

07:45.508 --> 07:48.782
Yeah, quite a few colleagues got
drummed out because they couldn't cope.

07:49.576 --> 07:54.060
The rest of us were so sleep-deprived
we could barely manage to stay sane.

07:55.058 --> 07:59.777
I'll never forget the day we caught
Seth Finkel gently cradling a cadaver head

07:59.824 --> 08:02.952
which he swore belonged
to his ex-girlfriend, Millie.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.645
A year later Seth actually did kill Millie.

08:09.550 --> 08:12.555
Ironically, Millie donated
her body to science

08:12.591 --> 08:17.277
and that spring, we caught another
intern cradling her dead head.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.585
Life's little cycles.

08:22.208 --> 08:25.448
Oh, boy, that was almost...40 years ago.

08:26.246 --> 08:27.267
Sir!

08:28.771 --> 08:29.780
Honk!

08:30.473 --> 08:31.494
Honk, honk!

08:32.000 --> 08:33.197
Honk honk honk!

08:33.760 --> 08:35.650
You tell her, Mandelbaum!

08:38.691 --> 08:39.724
Hey, slick.

08:40.029 --> 08:42.376
Will you come to the board
meeting tonight to help Dr. Kelso?

08:42.412 --> 08:44.150
Now why on Earth would I do that?

08:44.174 --> 08:47.390
For some reason she thinks if you call
a man "slick" he'll do anything for you.

08:47.425 --> 08:49.280
It also works on lesbians, so.

08:49.398 --> 08:50.477
Come on!

08:50.572 --> 08:53.589
You know that deep down inside, you're
okay with Kelso running this place.

08:53.660 --> 08:57.158
Deep down I hate Bob Kelso
and wish he would die painfully.

08:57.509 --> 08:59.211
Here's the research you wanted.

08:59.388 --> 09:00.502
Thanks, slick.

09:00.996 --> 09:03.450
Look, Kelso's a pain in the ass.
You know what I say:

09:03.614 --> 09:06.783
Bring on the next pain in the ass.
Hermione!

09:07.289 --> 09:10.329
- Have you seen Mr. McRae's urine test?
- I'm on, slick.

09:10.964 --> 09:12.900
You don't remember where
you left that cup of pee, do ya?

09:12.959 --> 09:15.201
No clue. We have to find
it or he's gonna kill us.

09:15.283 --> 09:17.243
Us? Try you, he's not killing me!

09:17.761 --> 09:19.815
Why is it gettin' harder to...walk?

09:20.602 --> 09:21.622
Uh-oh.

09:24.458 --> 09:25.467
Dude!

09:28.707 --> 09:29.893
That was lucky!

09:31.442 --> 09:33.297
So, have you killed anyone yet?

09:33.497 --> 09:34.506
What? No.

09:35.328 --> 09:36.502
Well, you will.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.544
Super!

09:38.770 --> 09:40.834
It's a rite of passage for doctors.

09:42.807 --> 09:46.177
If you're lucky, it'll be a
patient who's on his way out anyway.

09:47.867 --> 09:50.602
My first kill was a 19-year-old girl.

09:51.964 --> 09:54.758
She came in with severe abdominal pain.

09:55.075 --> 09:56.906
I thought it was appendicitis.

09:58.174 --> 09:59.159
Turned out,

09:59.242 --> 10:01.367
she was preagnant and didn't know it.

10:02.248 --> 10:05.336
It was ectopic and she
was bleeding internally.

10:07.262 --> 10:09.152
I should have checked for that.

10:10.408 --> 10:14.058
But by the time I discovered
my mistake it was too late.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.893
Sometimes I look at this whole hospital

10:17.903 --> 10:21.243
I actually see the faces
of all the patients I've lost.

10:24.019 --> 10:25.733
- Boogaboogabooga!
-Aaaah!

10:28.670 --> 10:29.617
Priceless.

10:32.060 --> 10:33.809
But I do see them sometimes.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.601
We don't need Dr. Cox.

10:37.666 --> 10:39.978
You know, we'll round up everyone else,
and not just the doctors,

10:40.002 --> 10:42.120
we'll get all the
non-medical personal too.

10:42.221 --> 10:44.634
Good idea! Ted!

10:45.704 --> 10:47.977
Who would you say is the
leader of the support staff?

10:52.290 --> 10:53.259
Well well...

10:53.418 --> 10:55.153
Look who has come crawling back,

10:55.194 --> 10:57.911
through the desert of shame,
to the oasis of hope.

10:58.403 --> 11:00.255
Begging for just one sip,

11:00.367 --> 11:02.862
of cool Janitor forgiveness. Well...

11:03.570 --> 11:04.619
the answer's no.

11:04.745 --> 11:06.577
- Please, Janitor!
- All right, I'm in.

11:06.713 --> 11:09.574
Dog gone it, I cannot resist
that adorable mug of yours.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.421
I'd have to throw a cup of acid on it,
to keep it from having power over me.

11:14.571 --> 11:17.114
Ok, so we just have to
round up everyone else.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.470
That should be easy.

11:20.602 --> 11:22.053
That was impossible.

11:22.654 --> 11:24.501
Where did I leave that stupid pee?

11:24.551 --> 11:27.725
- Dude, retrace your steps.
- Ok, I remember we were walking this way,

11:27.978 --> 11:30.890
and you had to stop Mrs. Butler from
wandering out of her room again.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.991
Oh, no! Mrs. Butler...
Back in here.

11:34.621 --> 11:36.070
- Then I got paged to surgery.
- Right!

11:36.141 --> 11:38.871
And I came with you to cheer
you on, and I hold your fedora.

11:39.141 --> 11:41.232
And then we went out
to the ramp to celebrate.

11:43.182 --> 11:46.305
- There it is.
- Why would it turn purple?

11:47.778 --> 11:48.602
You know,

11:48.646 --> 11:52.418
those 2 reminds me of a couple
of dogs I had when I was a boy.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.425
JoJo and Spike.

11:55.426 --> 11:57.931
One day JoJo got his head stuck
in the mailbox,

11:57.965 --> 12:00.435
and Spike went over to try to
help him and got his head

12:00.445 --> 12:02.869
wedged in there too and they both suffocated.

12:03.709 --> 12:05.775
They were extremely dumb animals.

12:06.506 --> 12:07.431
But close.

12:08.530 --> 12:11.868
Sir, my shift started 2 hours ago,
I should really go.

12:13.374 --> 12:17.782
You know, there are some things I sure
as hell will not miss about this place,

12:18.189 --> 12:21.869
like how more often than not,
medical skills didn't  matter.

12:21.926 --> 12:24.001
It all comes down to dumb luck.

12:24.530 --> 12:27.550
- Ok, I'm googling "purple pee".
- Google that bitch!

12:28.517 --> 12:29.291
That's it!

12:29.609 --> 12:30.682
We left it in the sun!

12:30.853 --> 12:33.089
If urine exposed to U.V.
light turns purple,

12:33.112 --> 12:36.650
it's a sign of a rare genetic disorder
called "Acute Intermittent Porphyria".

12:36.795 --> 12:39.947
Sintoms includes bloating,
high blood pressure,

12:40.026 --> 12:42.480
seizures... Cox's patient
has all of those.

12:42.927 --> 12:45.869
We figured it out.
Ah ah! 1, 2, 3!

12:46.281 --> 12:50.013
- In his faaaaaaaaace!
- In his faaaaaaaaace!

12:50.668 --> 12:53.218
...or how you can often have
more questions than answers.

12:53.716 --> 12:57.707
I just don't understand why no one
will help us save Kelso's job...

12:58.080 --> 13:00.408
That's easy. Word get out that
he wants Kelso gone.

13:00.627 --> 13:02.885
And no one wants to cross him
'cause he's a scary guy.

13:03.352 --> 13:06.419
Now, I'm not scared of him,
but that's because... I'm magic.

13:08.169 --> 13:10.572
- Is he dancing?
- No, no.

13:11.358 --> 13:15.209
Or how every day in this place
is made up of little battles.

13:15.486 --> 13:20.119
Or how around here once the ball starts
rolling there's not much you can do to...

13:21.405 --> 13:23.088
Sorry, Sir, did you have another?

13:23.369 --> 13:28.550
Or how around here, once the ball starts rolling
there's not much you can do to stop it.

13:32.173 --> 13:33.305
He's outta here.

13:34.876 --> 13:38.438
Or how patients don't appreciate
their doctors anymore.

13:38.789 --> 13:42.388
Or how medical skills doesn't matter,
it's all just a dumb luck.

13:42.753 --> 13:44.165
Oh, you already said that one, sir.

13:44.198 --> 13:49.842
Sounds my blood sugar is low, and unless you have
a candy bar in that gay little napsack of yours, shut it!

13:51.249 --> 13:53.460
Or how if you get to the cafeteria past 5,

13:53.610 --> 13:55.704
they're always out of pies.

13:55.792 --> 13:56.642
Dammit!

13:57.289 --> 14:00.672
What do you buy, like one
pie for the whole hospital?

14:02.245 --> 14:05.192
You ask him, if I do that he'll say something
mean over to hurt my feelings.

14:05.466 --> 14:07.762
We want you to reconsider helping Kelso.

14:08.069 --> 14:09.918
Could I get a "Hell, no!"
from any random doctor?

14:09.934 --> 14:11.704
- Hell, no!
- Thank you, whomever.

14:11.727 --> 14:14.969
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go
far, far away from annoying people.

14:14.975 --> 14:19.777
Especially whiny childless blondes
with stainded-coffee teeth.

14:20.441 --> 14:22.881
Oh, look at that,
he got you anyway.

14:26.119 --> 14:27.825
What the hell is this?

14:32.626 --> 14:36.664
What's the occasion? Did Barbie finally
wax her tiny annoying mustache?

14:36.843 --> 14:40.333
Stop saying mean things about me!
I'm not even talking to you!

14:40.728 --> 14:44.699
We diagnosed your patient, buddy.
He's got acute intermittent porphyria.

14:44.778 --> 14:46.997
- What?
- If it makes you feel any better,

14:47.008 --> 14:49.365
it did almost take us 3 hours.

14:49.370 --> 14:51.153
Oh, for the love of God.

14:53.241 --> 14:56.334
1985 was going to be my year.

14:56.491 --> 14:58.438
Economics was in folk swing,

14:58.660 --> 15:00.678
Enid's implants
hadn't exploded yet.

15:00.684 --> 15:04.837
And best of all, they made me chief
of medicine, so I was the king, right?

15:04.842 --> 15:06.115
Wrongo.

15:06.458 --> 15:09.599
I realized fast that in order
to keep this whole place going,

15:09.626 --> 15:12.516
I had to make one unpopular
decision after another.

15:12.521 --> 15:14.882
Regardless of who hated me for it.

15:16.186 --> 15:19.341
And that was a lonely realization, son.

15:20.499 --> 15:22.870
And here it comes
my biggest fan.

15:23.334 --> 15:28.576
Bob, there is finally a diagnosis on Mr.
McCray. He has acute intermittent porphyria.

15:28.607 --> 15:31.434
Now his insurance company
wants him discharged immediately,

15:31.442 --> 15:33.584
I'd like to fudge the
paperwork a little bit,

15:33.590 --> 15:36.942
keep him around longer and teach
him how to manage his desease.

15:36.947 --> 15:39.497
- No.
- I realize that your heart is made up

15:39.537 --> 15:41.893
mostly of muffin bits, the souls of little babies,

15:41.901 --> 15:44.807
and the dental grip you swallow every
time you suck your teeth to get out

15:44.818 --> 15:47.783
the muffin bits and baby
souls stuck in there, but

15:47.788 --> 15:50.310
What do you care? You're not
being in around anymore!

15:50.316 --> 15:52.803
Dammit, I'm still chief! Now,

15:53.616 --> 15:55.220
if you wanna fusìdge the paperwork,

15:55.273 --> 15:57.113
I want a promise from you

15:57.161 --> 15:59.985
that you will publish a paper
on the case. Will you?

16:00.646 --> 16:01.435
Deal.

16:02.005 --> 16:04.132
He'll never publish a paper on that case.

16:05.826 --> 16:07.384
He knows just ho to play me.

16:08.036 --> 16:11.787
Sure, he likes to pretend that
I win more than he does, but

16:12.532 --> 16:14.974
he walks away victorious more often than not.

16:16.721 --> 16:19.099
There's got to be a way to
get Dr. Cox to change his mind.

16:19.368 --> 16:21.006
Perry does not sway so easily.

16:21.130 --> 16:23.915
Unlike your husband, who'll probably
cave if you'd show him your cans.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.625
Don't even have to show him both.

16:25.955 --> 16:26.874
Left one's cooler.

16:27.096 --> 16:30.641
- Looks like a sea lion's face.
- It does. Turk drew it for me.

16:30.925 --> 16:32.948
Come on, Jordan, think.
There's got to be a way.

16:33.169 --> 16:34.867
Oh, my God. Enough.

16:35.017 --> 16:37.586
You know, there might be something
I could do to change his mind.

16:41.626 --> 16:42.782
So here's the truth:

16:43.889 --> 16:47.789
I was only able to diagnose your patient
when I left his urine outside in the sun,

16:47.865 --> 16:48.945
where it turned purple.

16:49.173 --> 16:52.760
Then I googled "purple pee", and
the internet gave me the answer.

16:53.289 --> 16:54.758
The universe makes sense again.

16:55.062 --> 16:58.629
But, please don't think this is going to
make me change my mind about Kelso.

16:58.805 --> 17:02.648
What if I was to sweeten the deal
with a sketch of Carla's boob?

17:03.485 --> 17:05.050
That's an otter!

17:08.065 --> 17:10.467
Even though I knew it was coming, eventually,

17:10.603 --> 17:14.617
it still shocked me when the board said
I had to leave Sacred Heart.

17:15.185 --> 17:16.788
But you know that, don't don't you?

17:17.123 --> 17:19.829
You've been sitting here
listening to me yap all day.

17:20.634 --> 17:22.438
By the way, what's your name, son?

17:23.040 --> 17:23.942
Boone, Sir.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.015
My God, what a ridiculous name.

17:26.383 --> 17:30.827
Boone. Boone.
My name is Boone.

17:32.466 --> 17:35.206
Well, I guess you should go, Boone.

17:35.842 --> 17:36.811
Really?

17:37.447 --> 17:38.951
Thank you, Sir.

17:42.661 --> 17:45.936
So... So you think my next 20 years
here will be a nightmare?

17:46.672 --> 17:47.774
No.

17:48.878 --> 17:50.750
I think you'll love it.

17:58.038 --> 17:59.976
I have news, Mr. McRae.

18:00.244 --> 18:03.920
You have acute intermittent porphiria.
Now, while that is manageble,

18:04.555 --> 18:05.925
I'm afraid...

18:06.461 --> 18:07.898
There is no cure.

18:08.033 --> 18:10.138
And then we got a respond that
we didn't  expect.

18:10.854 --> 18:13.782
Oh, man. I couldn't be happier.

18:14.383 --> 18:15.252
Excuse me?

18:15.872 --> 18:19.230
Just knowing what it is, makes it
so much easier to deal with, you know?

18:20.166 --> 18:22.371
And then I saw something click in Dr. Cox.

18:22.940 --> 18:25.781
What Mr. Mc Rae was saying
is that the enemy you know

18:26.418 --> 18:28.554
is always better then the one you don't.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.697
The board meeting is about to start.
It's just the three of you?

18:32.266 --> 18:33.636
I'll probably say a few words as well.

18:33.804 --> 18:36.478
Mostly about the potential of
mind control in modern medicine.

18:37.013 --> 18:38.168
Oh, this should go well.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.689
Wait! There's more people coming!

18:41.095 --> 18:41.759
When?

18:41.960 --> 18:44.165
Right now. Love Train!

18:53.827 --> 18:57.169
- Well, you could have made a bigger entrance.
- Let's get this over, before I puke.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.633
Well, Bob, your employees
really stood by you.

19:09.036 --> 19:10.673
- They pointed out to the board that...
- Hey.

19:12.478 --> 19:16.623
Well, you run a tight ship,and
actually we'd like you to stay on.

19:18.329 --> 19:21.102
Girls, thank you for saving my job.

19:22.206 --> 19:27.086
The one thing I wanted was to end things
on my own terms, and since you're letting me,

19:28.122 --> 19:31.163
you can shove it up your ass, Rodney.

19:33.371 --> 19:34.774
I'm out of here.

19:35.342 --> 19:39.387
"Little Victories"
by Matt Nathanson.

19:41.994 --> 19:44.634
I'm taking this with me, dammit.

19:50.686 --> 19:53.794
Thanks for everything, Ted.
Sincerely.

19:54.697 --> 19:56.233
You're welcome, sir.

20:03.053 --> 20:05.526
I'm wondering if he even cared
about this place at all.

20:06.596 --> 20:07.465
Yeah.

20:08.201 --> 20:09.236
He did.
