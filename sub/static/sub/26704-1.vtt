00:18.640 --> 00:22.000
- Yes, Caroline.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.810
- Green binder,
we have all the logistics

00:23.840 --> 00:26.210
for Senator Green's

00:26.240 --> 00:28.040
Red binder is the museum's

And the white binder?

for Lambton's annual

00:34.480 --> 00:36.850
Christmas Festival next week.

00:36.890 --> 00:39.050
It's snowy and white

Lambton, now,
your friend is the mayor?

00:50.730 --> 00:52.930
- Yes, George.
We met in college.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.940
- You pushed hard to get me
to agree to let you do this

00:55.010 --> 00:56.840
under Elite Events' banner.

00:56.870 --> 00:59.470
Is there something I should
know about this George?

- Oh, no, he is just a friend.

01:01.710 --> 01:04.080
- And do we
want something more?

01:04.110 --> 01:05.880
- With George? No.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.520
Although I did just
write a letter to Santa

01:07.550 --> 01:09.120
asking to meet my true love.

01:09.150 --> 01:11.120
- You what?

01:11.190 --> 01:13.490
- My five-year-old niece
didn't want to write a letter

01:13.520 --> 01:16.120
this year, so I said
I would do it if she did.

01:16.190 --> 01:17.790
- You're good about getting
people to do things

01:17.830 --> 01:19.660
they don't want to do,
aren't you?

01:19.700 --> 01:22.160
- I've been known
to get my way on occasion.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.200
- Well, this is the first time
you'll be taking the lead

01:24.230 --> 01:25.730
on an event like this.

01:25.770 --> 01:27.370
I know you're tenacious
when you sink your teeth

01:27.400 --> 01:29.240
into something,
but you're really more

01:29.310 --> 01:31.340
of a behind-the-scenes
binder type.

01:31.410 --> 01:32.540
Are you sure
you're up for this?

01:32.580 --> 01:34.210
- Yes, I am.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.610
I have learned so much from
you over the last few years,

01:35.650 --> 01:37.950
and I'm ready
to take the next step.

01:37.980 --> 01:40.680
- Okay, just know I will
be busy with my own events.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.480
I don't have time
to worry about some

01:42.520 --> 01:44.290
small-town holiday party.

01:44.350 --> 01:45.990
- I've got everything
under control.

01:46.020 --> 01:49.360
- Good, but if anything
goes wrong in Lambton,

01:49.390 --> 01:52.030
it will reflect badly on me.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.430
- I understand.

01:53.460 --> 01:55.730
- I hope so.
Your job depends on it.

01:59.770 --> 02:03.200
- Merry Christmas to you too.

02:05.610 --> 02:07.540
- And we have to set up a call
with the department heads

02:07.580 --> 02:09.139
about the Christmas bonuses.
- Yes, Mr. Darcy.

02:09.180 --> 02:10.580
- I told you,
you can call me William.

02:10.610 --> 02:12.880
- Okay, sorry, Mr. Darcy.
I'll write that down.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.620
- Travis, stop.
Relax. Take a breath.

02:16.650 --> 02:18.320
It's your first
week as my assistant.

02:18.360 --> 02:19.650
No one expects you
to know everything.

02:19.690 --> 02:21.290
You're doing fine.
- Thank you.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.390
It's an honor
to be working for you, sir.

02:23.430 --> 02:24.990
- You say that now.

02:25.030 --> 02:26.530
Wait until I have you
working through Christmas.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.130
- Oh, it's not a problem.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.960
I can video conference with
my family to open presents.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.170
It's just like being there.
- Timing's not ideal, I know,

02:32.240 --> 02:33.940
but I have to complete the sale
of my late uncle's estate

02:33.970 --> 02:36.600
before the first of the year,
otherwise--

02:36.640 --> 02:38.340
eh, I might get it
done before Christmas.

02:38.410 --> 02:39.470
- It's Pemberley Manor, right?

02:39.540 --> 02:41.310
- Yes, Lambton, Connecticut.

02:41.340 --> 02:42.810
- I saw pictures of Pemberley.

02:42.850 --> 02:44.080
It looks like a nice
place to celebrate Christmas.

02:44.110 --> 02:45.780
- It is.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.480
I spent several there as
a boy with my aunt and uncle.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.620
It's always very--
it's always very nice.

02:49.650 --> 02:52.190
- A big Darcy family holiday?

02:52.220 --> 02:54.190
- No, my father was usually
traveling on business.

02:54.260 --> 02:55.590
- Well, what about
this Christmas?

02:55.630 --> 02:58.190
- I always work
on Christmas, Travis.

02:58.230 --> 03:00.560
Morning, Matt.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.760
What's wrong, Travis?

03:02.830 --> 03:05.830
- I've never been
in a helicopter before.

03:05.900 --> 03:09.400
- Relax. It's only scary
when they fly upside down.

03:09.470 --> 03:11.010
That's a joke.

03:11.070 --> 03:14.380
- Oh, it was very funny, sir.

03:14.410 --> 03:15.940
- Yeah, that's usually
the reaction I get

03:15.980 --> 03:17.380
when I try to make a joke.

03:17.410 --> 03:18.680
That's why it doesn't
happen very often.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.150
Come on, Travis.
Pemberley awaits.

Can't you talk him out
of selling Pemberley Manor?

03:39.800 --> 03:41.840
- I've known William Darcy
since law school.

03:41.870 --> 03:43.440
Once he makes up
his mind about something,

03:43.470 --> 03:45.240
it is virtually impossible
to talk him out of it.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.570
- Tearing down
a place like that

03:46.610 --> 03:48.380
to build condos
isn't right.

03:48.410 --> 03:50.650
I remember when they used
to decorate it for Christmas,

03:50.680 --> 03:52.780
and we'd all go
caroling up there.

03:52.850 --> 03:55.080
Pemberley Manor is a huge
part of Lambton's history.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.780

03:56.820 --> 03:59.050
I mean, there's really nothing
we can do about it, okay?

03:59.090 --> 04:01.590
Anyway, we've got to focus on
this year's Christmas Festival.

04:01.630 --> 04:03.860
It's my first one as mayor,
and I want this thing to be

04:03.890 --> 04:06.660
the biggest and best yet.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.430
That's why I hired
Elizabeth to do it.

04:08.470 --> 04:10.900

are ambitious.

A tree lighting
on the night of the 21st,

04:12.670 --> 04:14.240
Santa's Village on the 22nd--

04:14.270 --> 04:15.870
- That's Elizabeth's best idea.

04:15.910 --> 04:17.540
It's a great
addition to the festival.

04:17.610 --> 04:20.170
- A concert on the 23rd
followed by a traditional

04:20.209 --> 04:21.740
reading of "The Night
Before Christmas" on the 24th

04:21.810 --> 04:23.980
and ending with
a toy giveaway.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.480
- Did you hear,
Elizabeth got Stan Findlay,

04:26.520 --> 04:27.950
the anchorman from the news?

04:27.980 --> 04:31.190
I love the way he says,
"Action News."

04:31.220 --> 04:32.650
- Hopefully
he'll leave that part

04:32.690 --> 04:35.260
out of the Christmas reading.

04:35.290 --> 04:37.890
George, we usually
just do one night,

04:37.930 --> 04:40.500
a tree lighting and the story.

04:40.560 --> 04:44.470
- I know, but I campaigned on
making big changes in Lambton,

04:44.500 --> 04:45.830
and this is a way to show

04:45.900 --> 04:47.700
that I'm actually
serious about that.

04:47.740 --> 04:49.900
- Are you sure your friend
can handle all of these events?

04:49.970 --> 04:52.870

She's great.

she's pretty amazing,

04:58.250 --> 05:00.680
so make sure she has
whatever she needs

05:00.720 --> 05:03.220

right-hand, so to speak.

06:34.510 --> 06:35.840
- Yeah, in the classic
literature section

06:35.880 --> 06:37.280
of the campus bookstore.

06:37.310 --> 06:39.750
We bonded over our
love of British authors.

He actually asked me out.
- No, no, no, no.

06:42.350 --> 06:44.690

by writing a dinner invitation

06:44.720 --> 06:47.320
inside the front cover
of a copy of "Jane Eyre."

06:47.360 --> 06:49.460
- You two dated.

06:49.490 --> 06:51.390
- Just once,
and then we decided

06:51.430 --> 06:53.090
we were better off friends,
right George?

06:53.130 --> 06:55.400

on a coffee order?

08:15.550 --> 08:17.850

It's his first week,
and he's still adjusting.

08:19.780 --> 08:21.680

how you can help him adjust?

08:21.720 --> 08:23.250

08:23.290 --> 08:25.450
- Don't threaten to fire
him over a cup of coffee.

08:25.490 --> 08:29.090
- Right, but you see,
it was a joke.

08:29.130 --> 08:31.730
- Well, clearly,
he didn't get it.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.429
- No, he didn't,
because he is young and new,

08:34.460 --> 08:39.000
and perhaps I have
a reputation that precedes me.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.270

08:41.299 --> 08:43.140
- Of caring about my business.

08:43.169 --> 08:45.340

to work for a boss

"Your job depends on it."

that to you, shouldn't you be

a car window instead of me?

I'm merely suggesting that

with holiday spirit upon us,
perhaps we could all

08:57.790 --> 08:59.950
be a little kinder
to our fellow man.

- Precisely.

09:12.700 --> 09:16.640
- Duly noted.
- Good.

09:16.670 --> 09:17.970
Merry Christmas.

09:18.010 --> 09:20.410
- And to you.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.480
- I am in so much trouble.

09:22.510 --> 09:24.650
- I can't see
who she's talking to.

I'm not going to fire you.

09:32.890 --> 09:34.920
- Okay.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.600
I didn't tell her to do that.
I don't even know who she is.

09:41.630 --> 09:43.600
- That's too bad.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.900
- Do you know who that was?

09:46.940 --> 09:48.140
- No, but I'm really glad
I don't ever have

09:48.200 --> 09:49.570
to deal with him ever again.

09:49.610 --> 09:51.270
- Yeah, but, Elizabeth,
that was--

09:51.310 --> 09:53.740
- George, I feel really good
about what I just did.

09:53.780 --> 09:55.740
Is what you want
to tell me gonna ruin that?

09:55.810 --> 09:57.650
- Probably.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.380
- Keep it to yourself.

10:00.420 --> 10:02.480
- Now, I know why you want her
to plan the Christmas Festival.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.390
She gets things done.

10:18.670 --> 10:22.340
- Hello. Welcome.

10:24.270 --> 10:27.070
- Hi, there. I'm William Darcy.
- Yes, yes, you are.

10:27.110 --> 10:29.640
It's so nice to meet you,
young man.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.250
And who's this?

10:31.280 --> 10:33.350
- Travis Payne,
Mr. Darcy's assistant.

10:33.380 --> 10:34.520
- It's nice
to meet you as well.

10:34.550 --> 10:35.680
- Tell them no.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.550
- Welcome to
the Pemberley Manor.

10:37.590 --> 10:39.020
- I'm sorry, and you are?

10:39.060 --> 10:40.620
- I'm the caretaker.

10:40.660 --> 10:42.320
You can call me Kristopher.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.360
- I thought the caretaker
was a Mr. Willoughby?

10:44.390 --> 10:46.660
- He was for many years,
but when he retired

10:46.700 --> 10:49.900
I was more than happy
to take over for him.

10:49.930 --> 10:53.330
- And why are you putting up
Christmas decorations?

10:53.400 --> 10:54.800
- Because it's Christmas.

10:54.870 --> 10:56.270
- We're only going to be here

10:56.340 --> 10:58.110
for a few days
until the sale is final,

10:58.140 --> 10:59.810
and after that the new owners
are going to tear it down.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.510
- I know, but that doesn't
mean it can't be cheerful

11:02.550 --> 11:04.510
while it's still here, does it?

11:06.450 --> 11:08.450
She's a grand old lady,
she is.

11:11.090 --> 11:14.660
- I'll take a look at it
and call you back in 40.

11:14.690 --> 11:18.530
- How long has it been since
you had a visit, Mr. Darcy?

11:18.560 --> 11:21.560
- Not since I was a kid.
I spent a few holidays here.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.700
- That must have
been very special.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.230
- It was a long time ago.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.640
- Why did you decide
to sell it now?

11:27.700 --> 11:29.740
- My uncle left it
to the Darcy Corporation,

11:29.770 --> 11:31.010
so it wasn't my decision.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.340
It was the Board of Directors'.

11:32.410 --> 11:33.740
It didn't make sense
to hold on to a house

11:33.780 --> 11:35.540
that's been empty
for so many years.

11:35.580 --> 11:38.350
- Why don't we go inside
and let you have a look around?

11:41.980 --> 11:44.490
Oh, we could use some light.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.560
- Yeah, that's better.

11:57.870 --> 12:00.740
- It's quite a staircase,
isn't it?

12:00.770 --> 12:03.540
Well, I guess this
brings back fond memories.

12:05.310 --> 12:07.680
- Well, many more fond memories
will be made by the people

12:07.710 --> 12:10.040
living in the condos
they're gonna build here.

12:10.110 --> 12:11.910
- I'm sure that's true.

12:11.950 --> 12:13.910
Let me show you to your rooms.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.890
<i> - I'm so proud of you, George.</i>

12:18.920 --> 12:20.250
Mayor?

12:20.320 --> 12:21.960
You always wanted
to get into politics.

12:21.990 --> 12:23.620
- I mean, I would
have done it earlier,

12:23.660 --> 12:25.860
but my law practice
kept me too busy.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.860
Then the previous mayor
announced she was retiring,

12:27.900 --> 12:30.200
and here I am.

12:30.230 --> 12:32.030
- Today Lambton,
tomorrow the world?

12:32.070 --> 12:35.840
- I think mayor is
enough for me right now.

12:35.870 --> 12:37.470
What about you?

12:37.510 --> 12:40.410
What's it like working those
fancy, New York parties?

12:40.440 --> 12:42.480
- It's not as
glamorous as it sounds.

12:42.510 --> 12:44.950
I do logistics,
so I'm usually in the back

12:44.980 --> 12:47.350
making sure
everything runs smoothly.

12:47.380 --> 12:50.350
- You were always the most
organized person in college.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.090
The color-coded binders.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.490
- Oh, I still use them.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.890
I've always believed that life
would be so much easier

12:56.930 --> 13:00.830
if you could color code
everything, family, work, love,

13:00.860 --> 13:03.830
although that one would be
pretty thin right now.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.530
- So no one serious?

13:05.570 --> 13:08.940
- There was, but we broke up,
so no, not right now,

13:09.010 --> 13:11.170
but you never
know what might happen.

13:13.180 --> 13:14.440
- But you like your job.

13:14.510 --> 13:17.110
- I love my job, actually.

13:17.150 --> 13:19.310
My boss can be a little--
- Demanding.

13:19.380 --> 13:21.080
I mean, at least
that's what you told

13:21.150 --> 13:22.780
the terrified guy
at the cart today.

13:22.820 --> 13:27.490
- Right, but I'm learning
a lot from her and, hopefully,

13:27.520 --> 13:29.990
one day, I'll be able
to have a company of my own.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.830
- I wish I would have
just hired you directly

13:31.860 --> 13:33.230
instead of going through
Elite Events.

13:33.300 --> 13:34.800
- Well, having
Caroline on board,

13:34.830 --> 13:37.670
even if it's just for her name,
is a good thing.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.270
Thank you so much
for giving me this opportunity.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.970
It's going to be great.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.670
- With the two of us together,
nothing can go wrong.

13:53.720 --> 13:54.980
- What happened?

13:55.020 --> 13:56.220
- Water main break last night

13:56.250 --> 13:58.250
right underneath
the town square.

13:58.290 --> 14:00.990
- What town square?
All I see is a big hole.

14:01.020 --> 14:03.920
- Where's the gazebo?
- In the big hole.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.890
- This is a disaster.

14:05.930 --> 14:07.760
There is no way they're
gonna get this fixed

14:07.800 --> 14:09.730
in time enough
for the Christmas Festival.

14:09.770 --> 14:11.570
- Well, is there
somewhere else we can do it?

14:11.630 --> 14:13.530
- Yes, I have spent the last
few hours compiling a list

14:13.570 --> 14:15.400
of places that
have the adequate space

14:15.440 --> 14:19.510
and requisite infrastructure
to accommodate the festival.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.210
- Bowling alley parking lot.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.980
- Mr. Dudley's cow pasture?

14:23.010 --> 14:24.910
- We would have to move
some calves to use that one.

14:24.950 --> 14:26.910
- There's no way that
anything on here comes close

14:26.950 --> 14:29.280
to the magic that the town
square creates at Christmas.

14:29.320 --> 14:32.550
- We could put some lights
on the big hole.

14:32.590 --> 14:34.490
- Come on, in a town
as charming as Lambton,

14:34.520 --> 14:36.460
there's got to be a better
place than the field behind

14:36.490 --> 14:39.160
Chester's Bait and Tackle Shop.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.460
What about the beautiful estate
I saw when I drove into town

14:41.500 --> 14:42.960
with the white fence
and the huge lawn?

14:43.030 --> 14:44.500
- That's Pemberley Manor.

14:44.530 --> 14:46.430
We used to have
events there all the time,

14:46.470 --> 14:48.970
but it's being torn down.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.700
- When?
- After the first of the year.

14:50.740 --> 14:52.270
They're putting condos
in its place.

14:52.310 --> 14:55.010
- Well, if it's not happening
until after Christmas,

14:55.040 --> 14:59.410
maybe we convince them to let
us use it for the festival.

14:59.450 --> 15:01.220
- It's worth a shot.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.820
Come on, it's this way.

15:02.850 --> 15:04.820
- [sighs]

15:08.620 --> 15:10.890
- It's perfect.

15:10.930 --> 15:13.130
It's so beautiful and there's
plenty of room out here.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.630
George, imagine it all done up
for the Christmas Festival.

15:15.670 --> 15:17.670
- Sure, we can string
Christmas lights

15:17.700 --> 15:19.800
on the big wrecking ball
that's gonna be here any day.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.140
- I thought you said
it wasn't being torn down

15:21.170 --> 15:23.270
until the first of the year.
Who owns it?

15:23.340 --> 15:25.010
- It was Fred and Edith
Darcy's house,

15:25.040 --> 15:26.810
but they passed away
a few years ago,

15:26.880 --> 15:30.010
and now their nephew
William Darcy is selling it.

15:30.050 --> 15:32.780
- Wait, Darcy, as
in Darcy Worldwide, that Darcy?

15:32.820 --> 15:34.550
- As in the hotels,
the airline,

15:34.580 --> 15:37.890
and a bunch of other things.
- Yeah.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.020
- That's the guy I saw earlier.

15:40.060 --> 15:42.520
I'm gonna go talk to him.

15:42.590 --> 15:44.360
- Aren't you gonna
tell her that William Darcy

15:44.390 --> 15:47.490
is the same guy she was
yelling at in the limo earlier?

15:47.530 --> 15:48.830
- What's the fun in that?

15:48.900 --> 15:50.100
- George.
- Okay.

15:50.130 --> 15:55.270
[doorbell chimes]

15:55.300 --> 15:57.540
- Elizabeth, there's probably
something you should know

15:57.570 --> 15:58.970
about William Darcy.

15:59.010 --> 16:00.270
- Don't worry,
I'll turn on the charm.

16:00.310 --> 16:01.840
It won't be a problem.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.480
[door opens]

16:04.510 --> 16:06.080
Okay we have a little problem.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.920
- Yeah.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.360
- So sorry to keep you waiting.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.920
- Oh, it's all right.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.290
Hi, Mr. Darcy,
I'm Elizabeth Bennett.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.030
- Yes, we've met.

16:20.060 --> 16:22.900
And, of course,
you know my assistant Travis.

16:22.930 --> 16:25.800
- Can I get anyone anything?
Coffee?

16:25.840 --> 16:27.400
Or, no, maybe not coffee.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.340
- We're fine, thank you.

16:29.370 --> 16:32.210
- So what can I do for you,
Ms. Bennett?

16:32.270 --> 16:34.240
- I'm planning this
year's Christmas Festival.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.610
Are you familiar with it?
- Yes, of course.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.780
I remember it
from when I was a kid.

16:36.810 --> 16:38.310
It was very festive.
- Yes.

16:38.350 --> 16:40.350
Well, usually, it's held
in the Town Square,

16:40.380 --> 16:41.820
but there's
been a water main break,

16:41.850 --> 16:43.620
and now we're desperate
to find a new location.

16:43.650 --> 16:45.590
- Okay, how can I help you?

16:45.620 --> 16:47.020
- We were hoping
that you would let us use

16:47.060 --> 16:48.620
the front lawn of Pemberley.

16:48.660 --> 16:49.960
- I'm sorry,
that's just not possible.

16:49.990 --> 16:51.390
Pemberley's being sold.

16:51.430 --> 16:53.660
- And being torn down
to make way for condos.

16:53.700 --> 16:56.260
I heard.
- You don't approve.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.400
- [chuckles]

16:57.430 --> 17:00.500
I mean, look at this place.

17:00.540 --> 17:02.770
George and Jane said
it's a really important part

17:02.840 --> 17:04.410
of Lambton's history.

17:04.470 --> 17:06.339
How could you approve
tearing it down?

17:06.410 --> 17:08.339
- No one's lived here
for a very long time.

17:08.380 --> 17:10.210
You prefer it just sit empty?

17:10.250 --> 17:11.849
- No, but it's so beautiful.

17:11.910 --> 17:14.180
Why not sell it to someone
who'll preserve it,

17:14.220 --> 17:16.819
or you could donate it
and turn it into a museum.

17:16.849 --> 17:18.819
Do something that
will benefit the community.

17:18.849 --> 17:20.819
- Like host
a Christmas Festival.

17:20.859 --> 17:22.160
- It's not being torn down

17:22.190 --> 17:23.960
until the first
of the year, right?

17:23.990 --> 17:25.930
- Yes, we're hoping to close
before Christmas though,

17:26.000 --> 17:27.490
if everything goes
according to plan,

17:27.530 --> 17:29.130
so we don't want to do
anything to jeopardize that,

17:29.170 --> 17:30.900
and having the entire town

17:30.930 --> 17:32.330
traipse all over
the front lawn,

17:32.370 --> 17:33.970
I'm afraid that creates
liability issues.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.470
- Well, I'm sure we could
figure out something

17:35.540 --> 17:37.070
with insurance, right, George?

17:37.110 --> 17:38.440
- Elizabeth,
I know the festival's

17:38.470 --> 17:39.770
important to you, but--

17:39.810 --> 17:40.970
- Yes, it's my first big event,

17:41.040 --> 17:42.440
but it's also important to you.

17:42.510 --> 17:43.980
It's your first
impression as mayor,

17:44.010 --> 17:46.950
and it's important to Lambton.

17:47.020 --> 17:48.380
- I am so sorry.

17:48.420 --> 17:49.980
I'm afraid
it's just not possible.

17:50.020 --> 17:52.090
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:52.120 --> 17:54.190
I have a conference call
that I'm late for.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.090
- Do you remember the part

17:59.160 --> 18:00.690
where we talked
about Christmas spirit?

18:00.730 --> 18:02.400
- Vividly.

18:02.430 --> 18:04.100
- You refusing to save
Christmas for the entire town

18:04.130 --> 18:06.800
is going to get you
on one of Santa's lists.

18:06.840 --> 18:09.600
I just don't think
it's the right one.

18:16.380 --> 18:17.950
- I can't believe this.

18:17.980 --> 18:19.980
My first real event
on my own and it's ruined.

18:20.050 --> 18:21.650
Good thing Caroline's
not paying attention

18:21.680 --> 18:23.380
to any of this.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.490
- It's gonna be fine. Look,
we can still make this special.

18:25.550 --> 18:27.550
- You're mayor,
isn't there some way

18:27.590 --> 18:29.260
you can make Darcy do it?

18:29.290 --> 18:31.730
Eminent domain or something?

18:31.760 --> 18:33.390
- Making him host
the Christmas Festival

18:33.430 --> 18:35.800
on land that his company owns?

18:35.830 --> 18:39.030
I hardly think
that's eminent domain.

18:39.070 --> 18:41.340
I'm so late getting a tree.
What about this one?

18:41.400 --> 18:42.940

38:38.830 --> 38:40.970
- Right, you have your
meeting about Pemberley.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.230
Sorry, we'll get
out of your way.

38:42.270 --> 38:44.540
- Oh, no, that's okay.

38:44.570 --> 38:46.540
Why don't we go
get some hot chocolate?

38:46.610 --> 38:50.210
- Wonderful. Ladies.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.650
- Bye, Jane.
- Bye, Travis.

38:54.750 --> 38:57.050
- Travis is kind of cute.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.150
- Is he?
I hadn't really noticed.

38:59.220 --> 39:00.620
- Really?

39:00.660 --> 39:02.720
I saw the way you guys
smiled at each other.

39:02.790 --> 39:04.560
- It was just a smile.
I was being friendly.

39:04.590 --> 39:08.030
Do you think he smiled at me?
- Definitely.

39:08.060 --> 39:10.300
- I don't know,
we're very different.

39:10.330 --> 39:13.200
I'm very organized
and he's not.

39:13.230 --> 39:14.930
- You know what they say,
opposites attract.

39:14.970 --> 39:17.400
- Is that what's going
on with you and Mr. Darcy?

39:17.440 --> 39:20.510
- No, he's not just opposite,
he's like a different species.

39:20.580 --> 39:22.740
- Mm-hmm.
A very handsome one.

39:22.780 --> 39:24.840
- Well, there's nothing
going on with me and Mr. Darcy.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.580
- Well, there's nothing
going on between me and Travis.

39:26.610 --> 39:28.380
- Okay, then.
I'm glad we got that settled.

39:28.420 --> 39:30.020
- Me too.

39:30.050 --> 39:33.590

39:36.520 --> 39:40.090

documents from the bank.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.430
There're here somewhere, sorry.

39:42.460 --> 39:44.230
- Relax, Travis,
you're doing great.

39:44.270 --> 39:45.870
- You're just saying that
'cause you don't want Elizabeth

39:45.900 --> 39:47.430

- Probably, yeah.

39:47.470 --> 39:49.540
That was a joke,
that was a joke.

39:49.570 --> 39:52.240

how to be more organized,

39:52.310 --> 39:53.740
but I don't know.

39:53.780 --> 39:56.540
- Jane, she seems
like a lovely young woman.

39:56.580 --> 39:58.940
- Oh, she is.
She's--

40:01.350 --> 40:03.320
She's very nice.

40:05.350 --> 40:07.390
- So, yeah, I have
to review the final draft

40:07.420 --> 40:09.360
and then the sale
of Pemberley will be complete.

40:09.390 --> 40:11.790
I should have it all wrapped up
by Christmas Eve.

40:11.830 --> 40:13.730
- You sure you want
to go through with it?

40:13.760 --> 40:15.830
- Of course.
Why wouldn't I?

40:15.860 --> 40:18.700
- I don't know, I just
feel like you maybe be feeling

40:18.730 --> 40:20.670
a little nostalgic about
being back at the old place.

40:20.700 --> 40:23.440
- No room for nostalgia
in business.

40:23.470 --> 40:26.140
- Okay. I just want
to make sure you considered

40:26.170 --> 40:28.570
all your options about
how the estate could be used.

40:28.610 --> 40:32.110
I mean, it's got
a lot to offer.

40:32.150 --> 40:34.150

41:13.120 --> 41:15.150
You should do it more often.

41:15.190 --> 41:17.160
- Oh, well, I love to sing,
but there's not a lot of time

41:17.190 --> 41:18.460
for that these days.

I've got my list right here.

41:40.450 --> 41:41.880
- Checking it twice?

41:41.920 --> 41:44.450
- Checking it three
or four times, actually.

41:44.490 --> 41:46.120
I have to admit,
I'm a little nervous.

41:46.150 --> 41:47.550
If this doesn't go well,

41:47.590 --> 41:49.150
I'm gonna have to find
a new career.

41:49.190 --> 41:51.920
- You just need to relax.

41:51.960 --> 41:54.960
- What do you suggest,
making more cookies?

for a few minutes.

- Sure.

42:02.140 --> 42:04.040
Okay.

42:04.070 --> 42:06.010
- Okay.

42:06.040 --> 42:09.110
- Can I open them?
- Yeah.

42:09.140 --> 42:10.280
I thought it was
something else

42:10.310 --> 42:11.810
we could offer
at the festival,

42:11.850 --> 42:13.610
horse-drawn carriage rides
around the property

42:13.650 --> 42:15.180
or even the town.

42:15.220 --> 42:16.980
- This is incredible.

42:17.020 --> 42:18.850
- We're gonna have to fix
it up a little bit, you know,

42:18.920 --> 42:22.150
some paint, maybe add some more
Christmas decorations, that is,

42:22.190 --> 42:26.230
if there's any left in town
after you bought them all.

42:26.260 --> 42:29.300
- I'll go see what I can find.

42:40.110 --> 42:43.340
- I can't remember the last
time I took a carriage ride.

42:43.380 --> 42:45.810
- I do.
Kind of wish I didn't.

42:45.850 --> 42:47.780
- Wasn't a good memory?

42:47.820 --> 42:49.480
- It was just
my ex-fiancé Jeff.

42:49.520 --> 42:52.020
- Oh, well, I'm sorry
I brought that up.

42:52.090 --> 42:53.920
- No, it's fine.

42:53.960 --> 42:55.890
I mean, we loved each other
and that's not a terrible thing

42:55.960 --> 42:57.490
even if it doesn't work out,
right?

42:57.530 --> 42:58.890
- How long were
you two together?

42:58.930 --> 43:00.760
- Two years.

43:00.830 --> 43:02.860
I wish I could say that
there was something big that

43:02.930 --> 43:05.600
made us break up, or something
dramatic that I could point to

43:05.670 --> 43:07.970
and be like, "Yeah, that,
that's the reason."

43:08.000 --> 43:11.570
Like, he loves pineapple on his
pizza, and I can't stand it.

43:11.610 --> 43:13.110
- Oh, yeah, that would
be grounds for a break-up,

43:13.140 --> 43:15.640
as far as I'm concerned.

43:15.710 --> 43:19.040
- Yeah, really, we just--
we lost each other

43:19.110 --> 43:21.410
and we couldn't seem
to figure out our way back.

43:21.450 --> 43:24.450
- I'm familiar with that.
- One of your models?

43:24.490 --> 43:26.850
- No, she was a teacher,

43:26.890 --> 43:29.360
and it was a similar thing.

43:29.390 --> 43:32.090
It was great until it wasn't.

43:32.130 --> 43:33.590
- But you want that again?

43:33.660 --> 43:35.530
I mean, the great part?

43:35.600 --> 43:37.900
- Of course, you?
- Yeah.

43:37.930 --> 43:40.670
I actually--you're gonna think
it's ridiculous,

43:40.700 --> 43:43.300
but one of my nieces
didn't want to write

43:43.370 --> 43:45.540
a letter top Santa this year,

43:45.570 --> 43:47.770
so I wrote one to convince her
it was worth doing.

43:47.810 --> 43:49.510
- What did you wish for?

43:49.540 --> 43:51.980
- Okay, you promise
not to laugh?

43:52.010 --> 43:54.580
- I promise.

43:54.620 --> 43:56.880
- I asked for true love.

43:56.920 --> 44:01.320
- Why would I laugh at that?

44:01.360 --> 44:03.590
- Well, hopefully,
my niece has more luck

44:03.620 --> 44:05.760
with her wish
than I did with mine.

44:05.790 --> 44:10.260

Christmas, so, you never know.

- Okay, great.

could see better out there.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.070
- Thank you.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.640
- Okay.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.440
- I think we can
take it from here.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.280
- Of course.

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:38.380
Elizabeth, let's have a chat
when you get back, okay?

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:43.390
- Ooh.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.960
- Are you cold?
Do you want a blanket?

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.430
- No, I'm--No, I'm good.
Thank you.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.560
- Okay.

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:54.600
- Wow, everything's
happening so fast.

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:56.100
Tonight's the concert.

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:58.100
Tomorrow we read
"The Night Before Christmas."

01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.770
Then Santa hands out the gifts.

01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:01.340
- And you're staying through
the end of the festival still.

01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:03.140
Right?
- Yeah.

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:05.640
I'll head to my parents' house
right after we wrap up.

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:08.050
- Christmas morning
with your family.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.820
- Mm-hmm.
- That sounds perfect.

01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:13.350
- Mm-hmm.
What about you?

01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:15.590
Are you still
working that day?

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.790
- I don't know, maybe
I'll take the day off for once.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.260
Possibly. We'll see.
- Really?

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:21.460
- Maybe one last
Christmas at Pemberley.

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.100
- Well, is that why you
decided to come here personally

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:29.700
instead of sending someone
who works for you?

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:32.340
- I guess it is.

01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:35.170
Pemberley has a lot
of powerful memories for me.

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:38.440
I couldn't let that go without
at least saying good-bye.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.150
- Why are you
selling it at all?

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.120
- The Board of Directors
decided that our company

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:45.550
needed to sell it.

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:47.520
- Yeah, but I'm sure
you could talk to them

01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:50.120
and change their mind.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:53.990
Why not tell them how
important it was to you?

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:58.460
- Well, the board has been
there forever, and my father--

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.770
[chuckles]

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.470
he would never
have let something

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.170
like fond childhood memories

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.470
interfere with
a business decision.

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:08.440
- You're not your father.

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:11.340
- But sometimes
I need to be.

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:13.680
- Well, maybe
a Christmas at Pemberley

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:15.580
will change your mind.

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:17.820
If it doesn't,
I don't know what else will.

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:20.020
- Me neither.

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.530
- Welcome back.

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:34.000
How was your carriage ride,
Mr. Darcy?

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:36.700
- It was lovely.
- Oh. Excellent.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.470
Well, perhaps,
I should give it a go.

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:48.710
Would you mind accompanying me?

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.820
I don't want
to do this by myself.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.280
- Oh, I think perhaps we should

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.850
let the other people
have a chance.

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:55.850
- Oh, they're fine.
Yeah, come on.

a little Christmas concert

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:19.410
into the hottest event
of the year.

01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:21.680
- Do you think she's the reason
all these people are here?

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:23.480
- She sent out
an email blast this morning

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.550
and had the social media
team working on overdrive.

01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:27.050
People even came
from New York

01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:29.520
because she said it
was gonna be spectacular.

01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:32.060
- Your concert would
have been just as good,

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:35.190
maybe better because it
was coming from your heart.

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.330
[both chuckle]

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.060

Kristopher,

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.430
but I'm content
being in the background.

01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:43.230
She's the one that belongs
out front.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:46.770
- Well, you never know,
Elizabeth.

01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:50.340
You might be more important
to this evening than you think.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:54.450
- Elizabeth, our soloist
has a sore throat.

01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:56.110
- Oh, no, is she able to sing?
- I don't think so,

01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:58.120
and now we don't have anybody
to do the finale.

01:03:58.150 --> 01:04:00.020
- Ugh.
- Hey.

01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:01.690
Why don't you do it,
Elizabeth?

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.450
You have a lovely voice.

01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:05.120
- You do?
I didn't know you sang.

01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:08.690
- I don't really.
Not in front of people.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.560
- Elizabeth, this concert
is important to Lambton.

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:16.730
It's part of the spirit
of Christmas.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.600
You don't want
to disappoint them.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.000
- He's right.
I'm desperate.

01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:21.370
You're in.
- Caroline, no.

01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:23.370

looking for a way

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:24.880
to make up for
the whole Darcy thing,

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.410
this would be
a great way to do it.

01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:28.650
I'm gonna go tell George.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.780

- That's great.
- Yes.

you played a big part

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.400

to work with us.

it might be a good idea

at this point.

of Elite Events,

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.460
on your own,
but here I am,

01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:44.590
it's Christmas Eve,
needing to drop everything

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:47.900
to make sure that you
understand that Christmas

01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:50.670
is not just sitting in a big
house watching the festivities

01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:53.840
through the window and that
she gets her Christmas wish.

01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:55.510
- What are you talking about?

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.770
- Well, it's a long story.

01:19:57.810 --> 01:20:00.280
Come on, come on.

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.820
[indistinct chatter]

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:13.020
- Elizabeth,
we can't wait any longer.

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:17.730
- Okay, let's do this.

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.730
[bells jingling]

01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:30.310
- William.

01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:33.440
- It's Kristopher too.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.380
- So sorry we're late.

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:38.380
We had a little,
uh, car trouble.

01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:42.190
Right, Mr. Darcy?

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.890
- Yeah, car trouble.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.520
- But we're here now,

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.490
ready to read "The Night
Before Christmas"

01:20:47.530 --> 01:20:49.260
and hand out some presents.

01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:50.760
- Well, the guy that was
supposed to read it

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.130
never showed,
so I'm taking over.

01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:56.100
- Actually, you know what,
Elizabeth,

01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:58.570
may I do it?

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.070
I think it's time
that I partake

01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:02.410
in the Christmas festivities
instead of just

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.940
watching them from
the window of my house.

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:07.710
- Your house?
I thought you were--

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:10.750
- I talked to the Board,
the sale's off.

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:14.180
[laughter]

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:17.490
- Okay, well, everyone's
waiting, so are you ready?

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:20.060
- Remember what
Kristopher said,

01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:24.460
"The things you love
are never too far away."

01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:26.730
- Okay.

01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:35.770
- Ladies and gentlemen,

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.510
reading "The Night Before
Christmas,"

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:39.680
William Darcy.

01:21:39.710 --> 01:21:43.380
[cheers and applause]

01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:46.620
- All right.

01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:49.650
- "Twas the night before
Christmas when all through

01:21:49.690 --> 01:21:53.160
"the house not a creature
was stirring, not even a mouse.

01:21:53.190 --> 01:21:56.590
"The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,

01:21:56.630 --> 01:22:00.030
"in hopes that St. Nicholas
soon would be there.

01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:02.770
"The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.400
"while visions of sugar plums
danced in their heads.

01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:07.870
"And mamma in her 'kerchief,
and I in my cap,

01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:11.040
"had just settled down
for a long winter's nap,

01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:12.680
when out on the lawn there
arose such a clatter..."

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:14.240
- Thank you, Kristopher.

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.050
- It's my pleasure,
Elizabeth.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:20.450
And I hope that you get what
you wanted for Christmas.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.020
- I already have.

01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:23.820
[both chuckle]

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:27.190
- "He sprang to his sleigh,
to his team gave a whistle,

01:22:27.230 --> 01:22:30.760
"and away they all flew
like the down of a thistle.

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.700
"But I heard him exclaim,
ere he rode out of sight,

01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:37.730
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night."

01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:39.540
[cheers and applause]
- All right.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.370
- Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:22:41.410 --> 01:22:44.980
<i> [gentle music]</i>

01:22:45.010 --> 01:22:46.610
- Merry Christmas!

01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:49.880
Who wants some presents?
Ha! Come on up.

01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:51.680
[indistinct chatter]

01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:55.320
How 'bout you, my friend?

01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:58.520
- I thought you didn't like
speaking in public.

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:01.460
- Had to try and make it
onto the nice list.

01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:04.190
- Well, I think you did.
