WEBVTT

00:01.794 --> 00:02.794
Get down!

00:03.712 --> 00:05.380
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:05.547 --> 00:08.257
We all lost Darden,
and that ain't changing.

00:08.425 --> 00:11.219
14 years at
this station and it all
fits into a box.

00:11.387 --> 00:12.762
Andy loved being
a firefighter.

00:12.930 --> 00:13.971
It was our dream
since we were kids.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.682
You sure it wasn't
just your dream?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.392
Peter's got
this whole idea

00:17.559 --> 00:18.976
of living up to his
father's memory.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.145
That is not the life
I want for him.

00:21.313 --> 00:24.190
Stephanides didn't
say anything about a safe.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.818
We didn't buy
that bar hoping
to find buried treasure.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.820
Yeah, we're going
to open the safe.

00:32.408 --> 00:34.117
We never should
have opened this.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.993
I know I wasn't there for
you like I could have been,

00:36.161 --> 00:37.995
and I'm in no position
to give you advice,

00:38.163 --> 00:40.832
but there is no
replacing rescue squad.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.834
Am I getting in the way
of you and Casey?

00:43.001 --> 00:45.962
I'm only seeing you.
I only want to see you.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.880
Daniel offered us
split custody

00:48.048 --> 00:49.716
if I move to New York
with the baby.

00:49.883 --> 00:50.883
Just stand up to him.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.093
I'm gonna go
to New York.

01:02.938 --> 01:04.021
Did I wake you?

01:04.189 --> 01:05.189
Yeah.

01:05.357 --> 01:09.026
Sorry! I just wanna
get the place clean.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.695
Look, my dad's only
coming for a few days.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.280
He won't care
about the carpet.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.115
Is that this week?

01:15.701 --> 01:17.785
Oh, the bags.
I just, I...

01:17.953 --> 01:18.995
Everywhere I look,
I see Clarice,

01:19.163 --> 01:21.539
and I just want
to get it out

01:21.707 --> 01:23.750
so I can move on
or whatever.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.418
All right, listen,
I'll get it down
to the dumpster

01:25.586 --> 01:27.086
when I get back up, okay?

01:27.254 --> 01:28.880
And I'll get
that to Goodwill.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.174
No, no, no,
that stays.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.300
Why?

01:32.468 --> 01:33.551
I...

01:36.138 --> 01:37.930
I want to have a baby.

01:39.141 --> 01:43.144
Look, Clarice ripping my
heart out for a second time

01:43.312 --> 01:45.897
was, you know...

01:47.900 --> 01:48.983
Devastating...

01:49.151 --> 01:52.028
But when I held Wesley in
my arms for the first time,

01:52.196 --> 01:54.822
I never felt
so much purpose

01:54.990 --> 01:57.408
or so connected

01:58.452 --> 02:00.286
to anyone ever...

02:03.957 --> 02:06.709
And it's really expensive,

02:06.877 --> 02:08.461
but I'll figure it out.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.423
I'll work extra shifts,
or, you know, whatever.

02:12.591 --> 02:15.134
Shay, you don't need
to be making any
decisions right now.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.969
I've made the decision.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.349
I'm gonna have a baby.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.789
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Kelly.

02:47.543 --> 02:48.835
Oh.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.755
Seeing you here is...
I don't know.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.343
I'm humbled, and...

02:58.595 --> 02:59.804
Very proud.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.311
I'm cursed.

03:07.479 --> 03:11.566
Herrmann, this contract,
if you wanna call it that,
is ancient.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.650
Doesn't matter.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.443
It states right there
that Stephanides

03:14.611 --> 03:18.781
and whoever the hell that
this Clifford Baylor is

03:18.949 --> 03:21.409
held a 50-50
stake in our bar.

03:21.577 --> 03:22.743
It's handwritten.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.787
It might've been
just a rough draft

03:24.955 --> 03:25.830
that wasn't
probably executed.

03:25.998 --> 03:26.914
It's not even dated.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.792
Should've never
opened the safe.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.002
Shut it, Mouch.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.797
Oh, my God.
What?

03:34.965 --> 03:36.591
Oh, my God.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.509
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
What, what?

03:38.677 --> 03:40.219
What the hell is it?

03:41.513 --> 03:43.890
Wow.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.892
You think
it's okay to open it?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.852
Think we're down
the road on this one.
Yeah.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.812
Dawson, please, don't.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.899
It is a gateway to hell,
I'm telling you.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.984
Besides, it's not
even rightfully ours.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.403
Possession
is nine-tenths
of the law.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.905
Shut it, Mouch.

03:59.072 --> 03:59.864
I'm opening it.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.160
Smoke eater
in the house!

04:08.165 --> 04:09.248
Nice meeting you.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.958
Candidate, front and center.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.419
You don't let a smoke
eater hump his own bags.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.921
Hey...

04:15.088 --> 04:16.923
Peter Mills.
Benny Severide.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.591
Oh.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.593
Yeah, yeah,
I got it.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.971
Okay, well, welcome.
Thank you.

04:26.642 --> 04:27.892
Wallace.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.647
It's good seeing you.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.899
Here for the Academy dinner,
I take it?

04:35.067 --> 04:36.692
Yeah, among other things.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.819
You going?
Giving the opening speech.

04:38.987 --> 04:39.946
Ah.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.615
Well, you always were
good at telling stories.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.285
Ha.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.454
How long you
in town for, Benny?

04:48.622 --> 04:51.123
A week or so.
Hmm.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.961
Hope it's not
an inconvenience
my hanging out here.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.212
Not at all.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.885
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.095
Hey, new candidate.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.932
Is that Henry Mills' kid?
Yeah.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.392
Come on. Ride along.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.527
What happened?

05:19.695 --> 05:21.821
Dude flipped out on the DJ
and threw these smoking cans.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.447
People are trapped in there!

05:23.615 --> 05:26.784
Battalion 25,
give me an EMS plan one
and a level one Hazmat.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.577
Mask up. It's game time.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.789
I'll bet it's orbital.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.541
What is that,
some kind of drug?

05:33.709 --> 05:34.709
No, it's an underground rave.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.502
They break into abandoned
warehouses each week,

05:36.670 --> 05:39.088
and by the time
the cops show up,
they're usually long gone.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.189
They're in there too tight!

05:58.025 --> 05:59.734
Then we pull them
out from the back.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.486
Help me, please!

06:02.654 --> 06:04.530
Hey, hey!
Don't move!
We're coming to get you!

06:04.698 --> 06:08.284
Cruz, Mills, assist Severide!
Everyone else with me.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.994
Mills, get me
a 35-foot ladder.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.162
Got it.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.093
Get everyone in this room
evacuated through the back.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.887
We'll handle the entrance.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.222
Help!

06:33.018 --> 06:34.185
Hang on! I'm coming!

06:43.487 --> 06:45.571
All right, let's pull
people from the top

06:45.739 --> 06:46.947
and get them
out the back.
Let's go.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.491
Take the stairs!

06:50.035 --> 06:51.869
Oh, I'm gonna fall!

06:52.037 --> 06:53.871
Ladder's almost here.
Just hang on.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.415
Stop pushing!
The rear exit is clear.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.958
Keep going up.
This way, this way.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.919
- Everybody out the back.
- Get up there!

07:00.087 --> 07:02.213
Try and get a good hold
on that windowsill.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.465
Hang on, hang on. I got you.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.265
Lieutenant!

07:21.024 --> 07:22.483
Here we go. I got you.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.235
Go! Take it upstairs.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.948
Casey!

07:34.412 --> 07:35.955
This is Casey.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.250
Cancel the Hazmat.
It's pepper spray.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.255
You all right?
Come on, let's go!

07:56.810 --> 07:58.102
What's going on with you?

08:00.230 --> 08:02.189
Yeah, sorry.
It's just...

08:03.316 --> 08:05.234
Seeing everybody
hustling into a building,

08:05.402 --> 08:07.444
not knowing
what to expect,

08:08.697 --> 08:09.864
that rush,

08:10.740 --> 08:14.910
and, then,
remembering all the guys
that never came out.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.078
I don't know.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.081
For some reason,
it just got me thinking

08:19.249 --> 08:21.292
about all the brothers
I lost on the job.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.253
Well, you got a key
to the place.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.963
Why don't you
hang out there
until I finish the shift?

08:26.131 --> 08:27.631
No, no, no,
I'm good, I'm good.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.550
You sure?
Yeah, I'm good, thanks.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.061
Casey,
you got a visitor up front.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.399
Heather.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.525
Hi.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.569
I didn't know
you'd be coming by.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.154
Oh...

08:50.322 --> 08:51.906
Everything okay?
Yeah.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.408
The kids?
They're doing good.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.076
We're starting to find
our rhythm again.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.828
Good.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.664
You look great.
Thank you.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.458
Why don't you come in
and grab a cup of coffee,

09:02.626 --> 09:03.792
say hi to everybody?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.836
I actually just wanted to...

09:08.465 --> 09:09.882
Here.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.219
I got this invitation
to the Academy dinner.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.429
Best party all year.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.889
Everyone would
love to see you.

09:18.934 --> 09:19.892
Okay.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.603
This is gonna sound
really insensitive,

09:22.771 --> 09:26.982
but I'm over being
the grieving widow.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.360
I wanna put it behind me,
but every time

09:29.527 --> 09:31.987
I walk into a room alone,
I'm swarmed with condolences,

09:32.155 --> 09:35.074
which doesn't exactly help.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.700
Would it be
a big imposition

09:36.868 --> 09:39.036
if I just tagged along
with you and Hallie?

09:39.204 --> 09:40.871
Oh, I thought you knew.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.499
Me and Hallie broke it
off a couple months ago.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.793
Oh, God.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.462
Matt, I'm sorry.

09:48.630 --> 09:49.797
No, it's fine.

09:49.965 --> 09:53.634
Come anyway.
A bunch of us are going.
We'll hang out.

09:53.802 --> 09:54.927
It'll be fun.

09:56.638 --> 09:57.930
Okay.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.267
The sperm donors
with college degrees

10:01.434 --> 10:03.269
I organized under this
yellow tab right here.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.980
If their majors were lame,
I put them under the blue one,

10:06.147 --> 10:08.148
and there's a lot.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.733
I just need your input here.
Check it out.

10:09.901 --> 10:11.360
Okay, yeah,
yeah, sure.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.739
I'm still just
digesting all this news.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.201
Well, you look like you're
gonna hork it back up.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.412
No, hey,
I'm happy.
I am.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.789
I'm happy for you.
I'm just...
Mmm-hmm...

10:23.957 --> 10:26.083
Are you sure this is the
right time for a baby?

10:26.251 --> 10:30.379
Dawson, I'm asking for your
opinion on sperm donors,

10:30.547 --> 10:33.382
not your permission
to reproduce,
'cause that's happening.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.136
Hey.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.179
Are we opening
the box or what?

10:41.975 --> 10:43.142
Ooh.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.355
Wow, that's cool.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.107
- A war medal?
- Silver Star.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.277
Third-highest military
decoration for valor.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.987
Of course.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.032
"For gallantry in action,
Clifford Baylor."

10:59.326 --> 11:01.869
We gotta find this
Clifford Baylor, Herrmann,

11:02.037 --> 11:03.245
get this back to him.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.705
Yup!

11:11.046 --> 11:12.254
You feeding an army?

11:13.757 --> 11:15.215
Hey.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.552
What's going on?

11:18.720 --> 11:19.928
Nothing.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.182
Being a complete
five-year-old.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.810
What do you mean?
What's going on?

11:29.606 --> 11:32.316
Severide being able to have
his dad come to the house.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.531
Hey.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.743
Your dad would be so proud.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.725
How's this for irony, huh?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.853
Yeah, life's full
of them, I guess.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.981
Listen, just so I got
my story straight

12:13.149 --> 12:15.150
in case the subject comes up,

12:15.318 --> 12:18.070
what version is the Mills kid
dealing with about his dad?

12:19.781 --> 12:22.199
He's living with the truth.
His father died a hero.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.868
Don't insult me, Wallace.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.162
Look, Benny,
I respect you.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.081
You had a hell
of a career,

12:30.041 --> 12:32.251
and you can believe
what you want,

12:32.419 --> 12:35.045
but the subject
of how Henry Mills died...

12:35.922 --> 12:38.173
That isn't gonna come up
unless you bring it up.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.429
I'm just here
to spend time
with my kid.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.222
Then do that.

12:58.236 --> 13:01.155
Did Heather stop by?
Yeah, she, uh...

13:02.198 --> 13:03.699
This whole Academy
dinner thing,

13:03.867 --> 13:06.660
she wanted to tag along
with me and Hallie.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.037
You're back with Hallie?

13:09.205 --> 13:10.456
No, no, no.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.418
So, I told her she should
come along anyway, right?

13:14.586 --> 13:15.961
Yeah, it's good
you're doing that.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.754
Yeah.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.339
And listen, after Andy,

13:19.507 --> 13:22.009
I know she took
her frustration out on you.

13:22.177 --> 13:23.677
That wasn't right.

13:23.845 --> 13:27.014
Well...
She needed time.
We all did.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.976
It'll be really
good to see her.

13:32.729 --> 13:33.937
Hey, Shay, you eating?

13:34.105 --> 13:35.022
No. No thanks.

13:35.190 --> 13:38.108
I'm not gonna eat
that stuff anymore.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.652
You on a diet?
'Cause that...

13:40.820 --> 13:42.029
That's intervention
time, honey.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.740
Okay, okay, fine.

13:44.908 --> 13:48.160
I have
an announcement to make,

13:48.328 --> 13:51.038
"A" because I'm completely
proud of this decision,

13:51.206 --> 13:53.749
and "B" to avoid
everybody here from acting

13:53.917 --> 13:57.044
like a bunch of gossipy
bitches behind my back.

13:57.212 --> 14:00.088
Uh, I'm gonna be
artificially inseminated

14:00.256 --> 14:02.966
and hopefully have a baby.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.801
So, I need to eat healthily,

14:04.969 --> 14:07.304
and, yes, I'm going
to be eating mostly fruits

14:07.472 --> 14:10.599
and vegetables
and organic lean meats,
and avoiding such things

14:10.767 --> 14:15.020
like the sausage turbo
cheddar scramble and the like.

14:15.188 --> 14:19.149
And now I'm going
to browse through
potential sperm donors,

14:19.317 --> 14:20.734
which was something
I was hiding...

14:20.902 --> 14:22.069
I don't feel the need
to anymore...

14:22.237 --> 14:25.197
And continue to look for
the perfect applicant.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.575
All right,
so listen, we still need
a name for our bar.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.710
I think that's great.

14:41.506 --> 14:42.589
Thanks, Casey.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.980
All right,
this baby thing,

14:58.147 --> 15:01.316
she's just
overreacting, right?

15:01.484 --> 15:03.652
You remember when
Clarice first dumped her?

15:03.820 --> 15:06.238
The dragon tattoo thing?
Yeah.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.407
We watched for an hour while
the guy traced that pattern

15:08.575 --> 15:09.992
all down her side
before she backed out.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.660
Yeah, but this
seems different.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.662
She seems, like...

15:13.830 --> 15:14.830
Serious.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.000
So, she has a kid.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.168
So what?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.562
Herrmann.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.523
Herrmann.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.483
Are you
kidding me? Right now?

15:43.651 --> 15:45.569
So, Stephanides
called back, right?

15:45.737 --> 15:49.906
Turns out he and Cliff did,
in fact, go into
business together.

15:50.074 --> 15:53.368
However, the two of them
had a nasty falling out.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.704
That's it?
Well, here's the kicker.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.205
Stephanides said he hasn't
seen or heard from the guy

15:57.373 --> 16:01.627
in over 40 years, so chances
are he's not interested,

16:01.794 --> 16:04.087
or, you know, dead.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.839
That's good
enough for me, pal!

16:06.007 --> 16:08.050
All right, let's find
Cliff or his family,

16:08.217 --> 16:11.136
let's mail that medal out,
and let's open up our bar!

16:19.270 --> 16:21.605
Hey.
Hey.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.191
Hey, so my mom
gets invited

16:24.359 --> 16:25.776
to the Academy dinner
every year,

16:25.943 --> 16:27.027
and she usually
brings me and my sister,

16:27.195 --> 16:29.863
but Elise can't go,
so there's an extra ticket.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.574
Wanted to see if you
wanted to go, be my date.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.035
Uh, yeah, I'd love to.

16:35.203 --> 16:35.952
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.162
Awesome.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.957
Mills, why are we meeting
out by the trash?

16:41.125 --> 16:44.169
'Cause that's our
deal at work, right?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.338
Yeah, I mean,
I know, but...

16:46.506 --> 16:49.383
Do you still want it
to be our deal?

16:52.095 --> 16:53.095
Do you?

16:54.514 --> 16:55.722
No.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.185
So, maybe we just
come out as a couple.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.980
Hell yeah.
Yeah?

17:04.148 --> 17:06.358
You wanna do it
at the Academy dinner?

17:07.652 --> 17:09.069
You know some jaws
are gonna drop.

17:09.237 --> 17:12.114
Oh, let them.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.241
Ambulance 61,
person in distress.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.076
So close.

17:20.415 --> 17:24.543
It was like a sudden
flash of pain in my head.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.586
Next thing I know, I'm blind.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.880
It took me five tries
to dial 911.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.216
Yeah, you probably just
took a good bump to the head.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.593
Concussions can cause
temporary blindness.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.429
But how did I get
a concussion?

17:35.596 --> 17:37.889
I was...
I was just sitting here.

17:38.057 --> 17:38.974
Wait a second.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.684
Ow, ow.
Just hold still.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.229
The bleeding's not coming
from the bump.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.149
That's a bullet.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.151
What?

17:49.318 --> 17:50.736
All right, Dave,
do you have any
firearms around here

17:50.903 --> 17:51.903
that we need to know about?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.029
No, I don't have any guns.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.448
Dave, did you try
to harm yourself?

17:54.615 --> 17:55.824
What? No!

17:55.992 --> 17:58.326
You've just been shot
in the head, all right?

17:59.996 --> 18:01.538
All right, sweetie,
let's get you up.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.881
Let's get him up.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.930
Need a medic.
I got another gunshot wound.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.309
Go. I'll call go
for another ambulance.
Okay.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.187
Where are you going?
This is my house.

18:25.354 --> 18:28.064
We're out here every couple
weeks on domestic calls.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.691
It's only a matter of time.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.651
Stop! Let me go!

18:33.154 --> 18:34.237
Here, put these on.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.244
His thoracic cavity
is taking in air.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.622
Here, take this.
Put it over the hole.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.165
We need to keep air from
getting into his chest.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.000
Okay.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.585
Okay, good. We have a seal.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.884
Damn it,
he's got a pneumothorax.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.928
It means his
lung's collapsing.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.680
Move back.
There might be spray.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.815
What do we got?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.817
Single bullet wound
that went into a pneumo.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.944
We had to decompress.
He's all yours.

19:32.547 --> 19:33.922
Hi, baby.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.466
Oh!

19:39.470 --> 19:40.679
Oh!

19:41.597 --> 19:42.848
Hey, hey.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.684
Oh, it's okay, baby.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.773
Hey, if you're all
done here, we gotta...

20:13.254 --> 20:15.463
Let me go!

20:15.631 --> 20:19.467
Don't you take my baby!
That's my baby!

20:19.635 --> 20:22.762
That's my baby!
Don't you take my baby!

20:29.437 --> 20:30.979
You know what?

20:31.147 --> 20:33.440
I think I prefer day sex
for some reason.

20:33.608 --> 20:34.816
Yeah.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.529
Hey.

20:39.697 --> 20:40.822
What's up?

20:43.117 --> 20:45.243
I went to the Academy
this morning.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.954
Um, looked through
some old files

20:48.122 --> 20:51.333
and found out that
Severide's dad,

20:51.500 --> 20:54.586
my dad, and Chief Boden
all were in the same house

20:54.754 --> 20:56.129
when my dad...

20:57.298 --> 20:58.840
When he died.

21:01.177 --> 21:04.804
Now, isn't it weird that
no one would tell me that?

21:04.972 --> 21:07.015
Did you ask the Chief?
Yeah, twice.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.601
Both times, he just smiles,

21:10.436 --> 21:13.146
nods all serious-like and
says, "Your dad was a hero."

21:14.941 --> 21:16.900
"Your dad was a hero."

21:17.068 --> 21:19.694
He pats my shoulder
and walks away.

21:19.862 --> 21:23.531
Maybe it's just hard
for him to relive.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.742
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.495
What does your mom say?

21:28.663 --> 21:30.288
Nothing.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.708
She doesn't want
to talk about it.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.009
Ingrid.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.470
Wallace.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.477
Benny Severide's in town?

21:54.021 --> 21:55.230
Yeah, that's right.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.110
And he's hanging out at 51?

22:01.404 --> 22:04.948
He has a son who's
a Lieutenant at the station,
so... Yeah.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.910
Is he gonna be at the Academy
dinner tomorrow night?

22:11.372 --> 22:12.956
I believe so, yeah.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.211
I don't want that
old fool saying anything
that would hurt Peter.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.758
And I have a magical
mute button that can
stop people from talking.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.635
Try and find a way.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.178
You owe me that at least.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.018
I should've known.

22:34.812 --> 22:38.064
Ingrid, the day
I stopped worrying

22:38.232 --> 22:40.150
about what people were gonna
say or what they were gonna do

22:40.317 --> 22:41.943
was the day I became
a happier man

22:42.111 --> 22:43.820
and a much better Chief.

22:43.988 --> 22:46.239
Do you really not care
if it all comes out?

22:49.660 --> 22:51.786
Ingrid, I have
a speech to write.

22:54.582 --> 22:55.957
I'll see you
at the dinner.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.591
So... Lesbian, huh?

23:05.426 --> 23:06.551
Pop, what the hell?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.136
Yes, sir, I am.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.512
You guys have
come a long way,

23:09.680 --> 23:10.930
what, with marriage
rights and the like.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.432
Mmm-hmm, we sure have.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.143
Tough growing up?
Um, no.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.771
I mean, two big obstacles
growing up gay

23:17.938 --> 23:21.107
are confusion
and lack of acceptance,

23:21.275 --> 23:24.235
and I was lucky I didn't
suffer in either department.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.487
Parents?

23:25.654 --> 23:27.113
Um, yeah.

23:27.281 --> 23:30.158
Divorced, but both
on board, really cool.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.452
Well, that's great.
You good?

23:32.620 --> 23:34.370
I mean, you got
everything you need?

23:34.538 --> 23:37.040
When are you gonna
get Kelly a good woman?

23:37.208 --> 23:39.209
Can I just make
a sandwich here?

23:39.376 --> 23:41.795
Hey, my buddy
at Station 48,

23:41.962 --> 23:42.921
he's gonna be
at the Academy dinner,

23:43.089 --> 23:44.631
and he's got
a daughter your age...

23:44.799 --> 23:46.341
Very, very sweet gal.

23:46.509 --> 23:47.801
I'll introduce you.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.761
How nice.
You're coming as my date.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.429
What? No.
You're coming. Yes.

23:51.597 --> 23:52.847
'Cause I'm not
dealing with this.

23:53.015 --> 23:54.682
Dude, I'll be a boring date.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.810
I'm not drinking until...
Great, that's even better.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.269
You can drive home.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.606
Perfect.
Oh, whatever.

24:01.774 --> 24:02.857
Fine.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.234
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.319
Well, I'm glad to be here.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.988
And, like I said,
I'm gonna make
more of an effort

24:09.156 --> 24:10.615
to come down
and spend time
with you.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.117
Yeah, sounds good.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.370
This Mills kid...

24:18.124 --> 24:20.667
Has he got plans on
moving to Squad one day?

24:20.835 --> 24:22.460
Yeah, last I heard.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.089
Vet him first.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.675
Make sure he's got
what it takes

24:28.843 --> 24:31.928
before you go in a
burning building with him
covering your back.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.640
Anything I need to know?

24:35.808 --> 24:37.475
I said what I said.

24:37.643 --> 24:38.810
Just vet him.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.708
Looks like
our driver took off.

25:01.876 --> 25:04.460
My legs are stuck.
I can't get out.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.839
Capp, Hadley,
get the spreaders.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.716
The driver, did you see
which way he went?

25:09.884 --> 25:11.301
Well, he tried
to avoid that bike.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.720
What, a motorcycle?
No, a bike messenger.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.264
He came out of nowhere.
We swerved, but...

25:16.432 --> 25:17.932
Hey, is he okay?

25:18.100 --> 25:19.809
Yeah, I think you missed him.

25:19.977 --> 25:21.352
Listen, just hang
tight while we try

25:21.520 --> 25:22.896
to get you out
of there, okay, buddy?

25:27.776 --> 25:29.027
I found the biker!

25:41.540 --> 25:42.957
Okay, Cruz, Mouch,

25:43.125 --> 25:44.709
let's get cribbing set
up on the driver's side.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.586
Herrmann, air bags.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.505
Mills!

25:49.673 --> 25:51.674
Grab a jump bag.
Track down the driver.

25:51.842 --> 25:52.759
Okay.

25:52.927 --> 25:54.260
This much blood,
he's gotta be close.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.860
Hey, hey, please, don't jump.

26:23.499 --> 26:24.624
Leave me alone.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.710
You're losing
a lot of blood, okay?

26:27.878 --> 26:29.295
I can help.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.757
Wait, wait, okay.
What's the problem?

26:32.925 --> 26:34.217
What's going on, man?

26:34.385 --> 26:35.969
You know why.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.720
I don't.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.223
Seriously, tell me.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.142
I killed that guy
back there.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.812
No, he's alert and stable,

26:45.980 --> 26:47.939
movement through
his extremities.

26:49.692 --> 26:50.775
He was crushed.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.027
I called out to him.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.530
He was unconscious,
and then he went into shock.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.074
No.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.702
Okay, a couple weeks ago,

27:00.869 --> 27:03.454
we pulled a kid
out of the lake,

27:03.622 --> 27:05.999
basically frozen solid,
all right?

27:07.167 --> 27:09.127
We brought him back to
life 10 minutes later.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.755
Sometimes, the body,
it shuts down

27:12.923 --> 27:14.799
and it needs to re-boot.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.761
You'll say anything
to get me off of here.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.681
I'm not a crisis
negotiator guy.
I'm a paramedic.

27:21.849 --> 27:24.892
I came here to check on
your arm and help out.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.730
If you're thinking
of killing yourself

27:28.897 --> 27:30.189
because you think
you killed somebody,

27:30.357 --> 27:32.025
I'm sorry, you're
working off bad intel.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.654
Hey, Lieutenant.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.782
Bike messenger guy, can
you give him an update?

27:39.950 --> 27:41.200
He won't believe me.

27:43.662 --> 27:47.582
Broken right femur,
a couple broken ribs.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.625
Apart from that,
he's gonna be fine.

27:52.963 --> 27:54.505
What did I tell you?

28:04.058 --> 28:05.808
Promise me you're not lying.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.979
I promise.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.231
Okay?

28:14.193 --> 28:15.318
All right.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.237
Got him.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.950
Okay, we got him.

28:28.082 --> 28:30.708
I figured it was
better to lie to him
and get him down,

28:30.876 --> 28:32.710
and he could
get over it later.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.962
You figured right.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.758
Come on.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.483
There's talking
somebody off the ledge,

28:55.651 --> 28:58.319
and then there is talking
somebody off the ledge.

28:58.487 --> 29:02.865
He wasn't gonna jump.
Oh, look at you, all modest.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.869
All right, yeah,
it was pretty cool.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.750
Look, I don't know
that I'm gonna be able

29:12.918 --> 29:15.461
to wait until the Academy
dinner to come out
as a couple.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.089
Then don't.

29:33.939 --> 29:36.357
Uh, don't mean
to interrupt.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.484
Just wanted to get through.

29:38.652 --> 29:39.694
Sorry, yeah. Uh.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.780
Sorry. Appreciate it.

29:49.371 --> 29:50.371
Oh, hey, Dawson.

29:50.539 --> 29:53.166
We need to speak to you
in the briefing room.

30:00.382 --> 30:01.507
What's up?

30:04.011 --> 30:06.012
Is Mills okay?
Yeah, why?

30:06.180 --> 30:08.347
Well, you were giving him a
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation,

30:08.515 --> 30:10.308
and I didn't know if...

30:10.476 --> 30:11.392
Ba-dump-bump!

30:11.560 --> 30:12.685
You weren't supposed
to say anything, man.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.020
- Who cares?
- I do.

30:14.188 --> 30:15.521
I told you to keep
your big mouth shut.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.523
Ah, who cares, man?
You're shocked?

30:17.691 --> 30:19.901
Is that why you guys
called me in here, or what?

30:20.068 --> 30:20.818
No.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.361
Otis.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.113
We found
Clifford Baylor's address.

30:24.281 --> 30:25.865
He's in a retirement
home in Elgin,

30:26.033 --> 30:28.993
so we figured we'd drop the
medal in the mail, and...

30:29.161 --> 30:30.286
Done with it.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.788
Drop the what
in the what? No.

30:32.956 --> 30:33.998
What do you mean "no"?

30:34.166 --> 30:36.792
I mean, we're gonna make
the one-hour drive to Elgin,

30:36.960 --> 30:39.462
we're gonna hand Baylor
his war medal in person,

30:39.630 --> 30:40.963
like he deserves,

30:41.131 --> 30:42.548
and then, we'll make sure
that he wasn't screwed

30:42.716 --> 30:43.841
by Stephanides
on the bar deal.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.051
Stephanides is sure...

30:45.219 --> 30:47.970
Stephanides was paying
hush money to that
building inspector.

30:48.138 --> 30:49.263
Remember?

30:49.431 --> 30:52.600
So, I think we can all
agree that Stephanides
is a little...

30:52.768 --> 30:53.768
Slippery.

30:53.936 --> 30:55.394
Okay, look, new deal.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.146
We go to the old folks
home after shift,

30:57.314 --> 31:00.191
and if Baylor is still
alive and coherent,

31:00.359 --> 31:01.567
we give him the medal.

31:01.735 --> 31:05.821
Then we bring up the
legally unrecognized
document that we found,

31:05.989 --> 31:08.783
and if he makes no claims
and everything is hunky-dory,

31:08.951 --> 31:12.078
then, kuh-ping,
we're out of there

31:12.246 --> 31:13.871
like ricochet rabbit,
got it?

31:14.039 --> 31:15.081
Got it.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.419
Hey, Lieutenant.

31:20.587 --> 31:21.712
Hey.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.506
I heard you did some
nice work at the bridge.

31:23.674 --> 31:24.715
Oh, you know, thanks.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.010
Um, hey, is your dad gonna
come back to the house at all?

31:28.178 --> 31:31.013
Uh, I'm not sure.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.848
If he isn't,

31:33.016 --> 31:35.726
do you think he'd mind going
to grab a beer or something?

31:35.894 --> 31:37.562
I don't know
his schedule, so...

31:37.729 --> 31:38.854
Yeah.

31:40.524 --> 31:44.569
He worked with my dad,
and I just wanted to hear,
you know?

31:48.615 --> 31:50.032
I need to know
how my dad died.

31:51.535 --> 31:53.202
I've spent my whole
life wondering.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.340
These places give
me the creeps.

32:06.508 --> 32:07.883
No, this one ain't so bad.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.303
What? No way, man.

32:10.470 --> 32:13.639
When my time comes,
I'm going Eskimo-style.

32:13.807 --> 32:17.852
Put me on an iceberg,
give it a shove,
and bon voyage.

32:25.777 --> 32:26.986
Hi.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.865
Mr. Baylor.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.367
My name is Gabriela Dawson.

32:33.535 --> 32:35.661
This is
Christopher Herrmann
and Brian Zvonecek.

32:35.829 --> 32:36.912
Sir.
Sir.

32:38.540 --> 32:42.251
We recently purchased
a bar from Spiro Stephanides.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.213
Okay, sure.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.175
Spiro.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.596
In the bar were
some personal effects.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.613
Oh, my goodness.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.871
Korean War, sir?

33:19.039 --> 33:20.039
Er...

33:22.084 --> 33:23.918
I lost a lot
of friends there.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.255
Thank you.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.386
Thank you
for bringing
this to me.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.477
Sir, there was also
a note along with
the personal effects

33:41.645 --> 33:43.979
regarding an ownership
stake in the bar.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.150
We didn't know if this
had been resolved or not,

33:48.318 --> 33:49.902
but we're honorable people,

33:50.070 --> 33:52.947
and if you feel that you've
been cheated or anything,

33:53.115 --> 33:54.865
we'll be happy
to work something out.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.035
No.

33:58.995 --> 34:01.080
Spiro got the bar.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.625
I got the girl.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.170
We were married 40 years.

34:09.756 --> 34:12.341
Spiro didn't think
we'd last a day.

34:17.347 --> 34:19.014
Oh, the bar is yours.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.059
Have a drink on me.

34:24.604 --> 34:26.689
That's very kind of you, sir.

34:26.857 --> 34:28.149
Thank you.

34:28.316 --> 34:30.151
Thank you so much, sir.

34:34.698 --> 34:36.615
Clear conscience. Done deal.

34:36.783 --> 34:39.744
Kuh-ping! We're outta here!

34:41.997 --> 34:43.539
Dawson, don't. Come on.

34:43.707 --> 34:47.334
Whatever it is,
we're walking down the hallway
and out the door.

34:55.177 --> 34:56.635
What was your wife's name?

35:01.975 --> 35:04.143
All right, let's get the
other hoof up here, partner.

35:04.311 --> 35:05.811
You good?
Yeah, I'm good.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.730
Okey-doke.

35:20.076 --> 35:21.744
What the hell's going on?

35:36.218 --> 35:37.676
You...

35:38.929 --> 35:41.138
You're really gonna
call it "Molly's"?

35:46.770 --> 35:48.270
If that's okay with you.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.238
Hey.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.578
Thanks.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.748
Come on, just one sip.
Hey! Whoa!

36:07.916 --> 36:09.583
Oh, you suck. Really?

36:09.751 --> 36:12.086
Gotta get your oven
ready for that bun, baby.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.173
Hey, listen,
thanks for backing me up.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.800
I mean it.

36:17.968 --> 36:19.969
Come on.
You're my girl.
You know that.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.223
Hey.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.225
Hey!
Hey, guys.

36:26.393 --> 36:27.601
Hi.
Hey.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.772
Hey, Heather.
Hey, Kelly.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.357
It's good to see you.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.775
I'm really glad
you could come.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.777
Yeah, me too.

36:38.864 --> 36:39.905
I mean that.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.827
Drink?
Yes.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.840
When's the last time you
heard anybody say that?

36:58.008 --> 36:59.300
Mmm-hmm.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.763
Hey, Ma, you remember
Benny Severide?

37:04.931 --> 37:06.515
He and Dad
worked together.

37:06.683 --> 37:07.933
Yeah, I know.

37:19.029 --> 37:21.405
Looking sharp, Lieutenant.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.698
You too.

37:29.748 --> 37:30.998
Treat her right.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.460
I will.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.890
I would like
to thank everyone
for coming out tonight

37:48.058 --> 37:51.769
to support the Academy's
scholarship fund.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.818
When I look
around this room,

38:01.321 --> 38:03.739
I think of the importance
that this institution

38:03.907 --> 38:07.201
has had on each
and every firefighter here.

38:07.369 --> 38:09.745
The discipline,
the tradition,

38:09.913 --> 38:11.163
it's what ties us
all together,

38:11.331 --> 38:14.249
the young
and the well-seasoned alike,

38:14.417 --> 38:16.460
and I'm very
well-seasoned, so...

38:17.963 --> 38:19.838
This was made clear
the other day

38:20.006 --> 38:24.885
when I watched
a young candidate's
bold actions save a life,

38:25.971 --> 38:27.846
and he's sitting
right there.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.223
He's Peter Mills.

38:30.934 --> 38:35.312
Now, for me, it was like
looking back 20 years

38:36.940 --> 38:38.941
to the same
candidate's father, Henry,

38:40.819 --> 38:42.277
a firefighter
who I served with

38:42.445 --> 38:46.365
and who selflessly gave his
life in the line of duty.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.668
This father and son,

39:00.255 --> 39:02.381
they attended the Academy
many years apart,

39:02.549 --> 39:05.467
but somehow they shared
the same capacity

39:05.635 --> 39:06.927
for exceptional heroism.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.224
Truth is...

39:12.392 --> 39:16.395
Every soul who knocks
on those Academy doors
asking to serve,

39:18.857 --> 39:20.315
they're already heroes

39:21.818 --> 39:23.819
because they were
born that way.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.531
When we are gone,

39:27.699 --> 39:30.075
they will be the ones
left holding the torch,

39:30.952 --> 39:32.786
assuring that,
for generations to come,

39:32.954 --> 39:35.330
the CFD Academy
will be the stalwart

39:35.498 --> 39:38.375
and the bedrock
of this department

39:39.586 --> 39:40.919
and this great city.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.970
Mom. You okay?

39:50.138 --> 39:51.930
Yeah. I'm fine.

40:00.023 --> 40:02.733
Hi. Oh, I'm Gabriela
Dawson, and I actually...

40:02.901 --> 40:04.985
So, Benny,
you proud of yourself?

40:06.946 --> 40:09.406
Oh, you know,
I guess I'm at an age

40:09.574 --> 40:11.992
where I don't want to
listen to fairytales.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.955
Yeah, well, you take
care of yourself, Benny.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.665
You know,
what I can't reconcile

40:18.833 --> 40:20.876
after all this time is
how you can still play up

40:21.044 --> 40:22.878
your Saint Boden
act about Henry

40:23.046 --> 40:26.006
when you're part
of the reason he never
made it out of there.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.511
Henry was trying to prove
himself to you that night,

40:30.678 --> 40:32.346
and he took unnecessary
risks because of it.

40:32.514 --> 40:34.431
He was doing his job.
My ass!

40:35.850 --> 40:36.809
He was trying
to prove himself

40:36.976 --> 40:38.143
to the guy who slept
with his wife.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.816
Yeah. I knew.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.193
Henry told me.

40:50.532 --> 40:52.866
Benny, you should
walk away from me,

40:53.952 --> 40:55.953
right now,
before I lay you out.

40:59.541 --> 41:00.916
You got it...

41:02.210 --> 41:03.502
Chief.

41:21.980 --> 41:25.190
That was...
So fun.

41:25.358 --> 41:27.568
Thank you so much.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.528
I'm glad you had
a good time, Heather.

41:29.696 --> 41:31.113
It was great seeing you.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.741
You have always
been there for me, Matt,

41:34.909 --> 41:39.288
and I can't even tell
you what that means to me.

41:39.455 --> 41:40.706
It's my pleasure.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.978
Good night.

42:03.146 --> 42:04.146
Yeah.

42:13.489 --> 42:14.948
Oh, man.
