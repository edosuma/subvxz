00:08.386 --> 00:10.336
<i>Previously on</i>
"Star Trek: Discovery"...

00:10.508 --> 00:12.136
What is that?

00:12.331 --> 00:14.341
<i>Discovery?
This is Stamets.</i>

00:14.427 --> 00:15.877
We've picked up a hitchhiker.

00:15.963 --> 00:17.690
Its accessing
our ships datacore.

00:17.776 --> 00:18.919
<i>We have your, uh,</i>

00:19.004 --> 00:20.508
shuttle screens
mirrored here, sir. Whoa.

00:20.593 --> 00:22.563
The probe is searching our
computers at incredible speeds.

00:22.648 --> 00:25.421
Owo, beam us out, now, now, now!

00:26.939 --> 00:29.288
Commander Airiam, are they safe?

00:29.868 --> 00:31.320
Commander Airiam?

00:32.741 --> 00:34.921
They are securely on board.

00:35.546 --> 00:37.757
Thanks to Commander
Sarus enhanced eyesight,

00:37.843 --> 00:39.547
he was able to get a better look
at the Red Angel.

00:39.632 --> 00:41.593
The entity appears
to be humanoid.

00:41.685 --> 00:42.812
Control,

00:42.898 --> 00:44.601
which model Section 31s
threat assessments,

00:44.687 --> 00:46.124
is probably rightfully alarmed

00:46.210 --> 00:48.562
by a time-traveling being
pursuing its own agenda.

00:48.648 --> 00:50.491
It has extremely
advanced technology.

00:50.577 --> 00:53.256
And what happens when that
technology is turned against us?

00:53.342 --> 00:55.709
It is critical Lieutenant
Spock be apprehended

00:55.795 --> 00:56.866
as soon as possible.

00:56.952 --> 00:58.257
And by fleeing with her brother,

00:58.343 --> 01:00.874
Commander Burnham has committed
yet another act of mutiny.

01:00.999 --> 01:02.452
Spock is innocent.

01:02.538 --> 01:04.122
There were no murders.

01:04.245 --> 01:05.562
I have seen the Red Angel.

01:05.710 --> 01:07.259
And it revealed
the final outcome

01:07.344 --> 01:08.930
- of our current timeline.
- And what is that outcome?

01:09.015 --> 01:10.569
A future in which
all sentient life

01:10.632 --> 01:12.392
in our galaxy
has been eradicated.

01:13.502 --> 01:14.951
<i>- In just a few minutes...
- Discovery will become</i>

01:15.036 --> 01:17.249
the most wanted ship
in the galaxy.

01:17.335 --> 01:19.437
My limited experience
as a fugitive suggests

01:19.523 --> 01:20.605
only one course of action.

01:20.690 --> 01:21.807
And what is that?

01:22.484 --> 01:23.627
We run.

02:15.014 --> 02:16.693
Scans on my end were negative.

02:16.779 --> 02:18.139
I don't think anyone
tracked me here.

02:18.224 --> 02:20.091
Our scans were clear
as well, Admiral Cornwell.

02:20.177 --> 02:21.255
Welcome aboard.

02:21.341 --> 02:23.420
Wish it were under better
circumstances, Mr. Saru.

02:23.506 --> 02:25.408
You've looked into my
concerns about Section 31?

02:25.494 --> 02:26.568
I have.

02:26.654 --> 02:27.761
But before we get into
any of that,

02:27.846 --> 02:30.080
I need to speak privately
with Mr. Spock.

02:31.127 --> 02:32.431
They were going to torture him

02:32.517 --> 02:34.892
with technology thats
never even been seen

02:34.978 --> 02:36.619
by the rest of Starfleet.

02:36.839 --> 02:38.916
For all we know, they
couldve killed him.

02:39.018 --> 02:41.619
Not to mention,
they ordered their agent

02:41.705 --> 02:43.021
to sabotage our spore drive.

02:43.106 --> 02:45.276
I'm aware of the accusations.

02:47.066 --> 02:49.002
Whatever Section 31 said,

02:49.517 --> 02:51.330
its not prudent
to trust them.

02:51.699 --> 02:53.361
You may think were all
on the same team...

02:53.447 --> 02:55.799
You have no idea
what Im thinking.

02:56.424 --> 02:57.775
Where's Spock?

02:58.385 --> 03:00.252
Beginning cerebral mapping.

03:00.369 --> 03:01.900
Try not to move.

03:08.942 --> 03:11.061
Okay. Lets begin.

03:12.536 --> 03:15.686
State your rank,
position, and assignment.

03:15.817 --> 03:17.084
My rank is Lieutenant.

03:17.170 --> 03:18.482
And I am a science officer

03:18.568 --> 03:20.053
<i>assigned to
the starship Enterprise.</i>

03:20.162 --> 03:24.055
Lieutenant Spock, do you intend
to be truthful with me today?

03:24.186 --> 03:25.232
I do.

03:25.389 --> 03:26.686
Good.

03:27.863 --> 03:30.393
Did you recently leave
a psychiatric facility

03:30.479 --> 03:31.693
without permission?

03:31.897 --> 03:33.115
No.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.540
I committed myself
to the facility;

03:35.626 --> 03:37.529
therefore, required no
permission to leave it.

03:37.633 --> 03:40.679
When you left, did you murder
Starfleet personnel

03:40.765 --> 03:41.858
in the process?

03:41.983 --> 03:42.949
I did not.

03:43.034 --> 03:45.264
- Did you kill them in self-defense?
- I did not.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.178
Can you explain to me
why you did kill them?

03:47.264 --> 03:49.693
Admiral, I believe
I've been quite clear.

03:49.990 --> 03:51.912
I did not kill anyone at all.

03:56.139 --> 03:57.568
He's innocent.

03:58.186 --> 03:59.381
I know Tyler.

03:59.550 --> 04:01.350
He wouldn't sabotage
our spore drive.

04:01.518 --> 04:02.733
He's loyal to Starfleet.

04:02.819 --> 04:04.529
He's loyal to Section 31.

04:04.651 --> 04:05.935
They seem to have
a different agenda

04:06.020 --> 04:07.608
than Starfleet these days.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.740
Let me talk to him. Please.

04:09.826 --> 04:12.412
No contact.
Thats an order.

04:12.614 --> 04:14.130
I understand this
must be difficult

04:14.216 --> 04:15.928
given your history with him.

04:16.029 --> 04:17.512
But our mission takes priority.

04:17.786 --> 04:18.916
Your brother is the only one

04:19.003 --> 04:20.553
whos had direct contact
with the Red Angel.

04:20.637 --> 04:21.820
I need you to help
him figure out

04:21.904 --> 04:23.248
who it is and what they want.

04:23.334 --> 04:26.084
- Can I count on you to do that?
- Of course, sir.

04:26.326 --> 04:28.201
And I'll prove that
Tyler is innocent.

04:28.655 --> 04:30.076
You can count on that, too.

04:31.515 --> 04:33.498
How did you escape
the psychiatric facility

04:33.615 --> 04:34.959
if not with violence?

04:35.045 --> 04:36.975
I performed what is
colloquially referred to

04:37.068 --> 04:38.561
as a "Vulcan nerve pinch."

04:38.687 --> 04:41.428
A disabling maneuver never known
to inflict permanent harm.

04:41.525 --> 04:43.779
You committed yourself
to the facility.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.904
Why escape at all?

04:47.444 --> 04:48.839
I did not initially
believe the visions

04:48.924 --> 04:50.909
shown to me by
the Red Angel were real,

04:51.232 --> 04:53.522
and therefore questioned
my sanity.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.420
Once I learned I was sane,
to have remained confined

04:56.506 --> 04:57.850
would have been unproductive.

04:57.936 --> 05:00.621
Do you have any idea
why the Red Angel

05:00.733 --> 05:03.568
chose you to receive
these visions?

05:03.813 --> 05:05.225
I do not.

05:06.009 --> 05:08.325
I have asked myself
that question many times.

05:08.411 --> 05:09.929
Any idea what they mean?

05:10.015 --> 05:11.983
Someone or something

05:12.123 --> 05:14.558
is going to end
all sentient life in the galaxy.

05:16.873 --> 05:20.124
And when you say the end
of all sentient life,

05:20.279 --> 05:22.584
- you mean...
- I mean precisely that.

05:22.678 --> 05:25.154
No humans, no Vulcans,
no Federation.

05:25.341 --> 05:27.037
No conscious life of any kind.

05:29.791 --> 05:31.275
Admiral...

05:32.071 --> 05:33.615
If I may...

05:33.844 --> 05:35.279
I believe him.

05:35.795 --> 05:38.311
And I know for a fact
he didn't murder anyone.

05:38.638 --> 05:41.350
Well, perhaps youre defending
him because you're his sister.

05:41.514 --> 05:43.076
Not by blood.

05:48.231 --> 05:50.420
He's telling the truth
about the murders.

05:50.660 --> 05:52.459
Or he believes he is.

05:52.630 --> 05:54.094
Uh, forgive me, Admiral,

05:54.187 --> 05:56.703
but I fail to understand
your doubt.

05:56.789 --> 05:58.938
Is the test
you administered inaccurate?

05:59.024 --> 06:01.547
The test is 100% accurate.

06:01.740 --> 06:03.108
But so is this...

06:16.975 --> 06:18.766
Thats not the Spock I know.

06:19.101 --> 06:20.391
It must have been doctored.

06:20.477 --> 06:22.226
I verified the source codes.

06:22.312 --> 06:24.152
The images come
straight from Psych.

06:24.822 --> 06:27.167
The admirals who run Section 31

06:27.297 --> 06:29.681
haven't responded to me in weeks.

06:29.971 --> 06:32.430
Their threat-assessment
system, Control,

06:32.540 --> 06:34.703
isn't accepting my
data-input codes anymore.

06:34.845 --> 06:36.727
Any idea who programmed it
to shut you out?

06:36.899 --> 06:40.063
Admiral Patar.
She's a logic extremist.

06:40.258 --> 06:41.619
Frankly, I find her

06:41.704 --> 06:45.274
fanaticism... worrying.

06:45.674 --> 06:47.307
Once the signals appeared,

06:47.393 --> 06:50.752
she started lobbying Starfleet
to turn its decision-making

06:50.838 --> 06:52.666
entirely over to Control.

06:52.901 --> 06:54.732
Control is a great resource.

06:54.817 --> 06:57.127
Every Starfleet admiral
feeds data into it.

06:57.213 --> 06:58.807
We consider its recommendations,

06:58.893 --> 07:01.777
but final decisions
always include our experience

07:01.957 --> 07:03.407
and instinct.

07:03.492 --> 07:05.809
But to raise your concerns
with Starfleet,

07:05.894 --> 07:09.013
you risk inadvertently
informing the admiral.

07:09.098 --> 07:11.716
Which explains why
you have come here in secret.

07:12.436 --> 07:14.349
The upside to being a fugitive.

07:15.005 --> 07:16.114
How can we help?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.955
Control is located
within Section 31s

07:19.040 --> 07:21.013
forward operating base.

07:21.323 --> 07:23.807
We need to go there,
arrest Patar,

07:23.946 --> 07:26.245
and reset the system
to take our input,

07:26.330 --> 07:27.513
as it always has.

07:28.052 --> 07:30.036
We rely on Control

07:30.122 --> 07:32.458
for all of our critical
strategic decisions.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.871
If its in the hands

07:33.956 --> 07:38.731
of extremists,
the entire Federation is in danger.

07:39.639 --> 07:40.919
Right, then...

07:44.345 --> 07:45.966
...we should get moving.

07:48.263 --> 07:50.054
Admiral, Admiral, hello. Hi.

07:50.139 --> 07:51.419
Lovely to see you, um...

07:51.505 --> 07:53.521
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm-I'm not a fugitive.

07:53.606 --> 07:54.925
I've never been
a fugitive before.

07:55.010 --> 07:56.419
Except, well, when I was 16,

07:56.505 --> 07:57.826
I went through kind
of a rebellious phase,

07:57.911 --> 07:59.467
- and I, uh, hacked into...
- Did you have something

07:59.552 --> 08:01.427
- to report, Ensign?
- Yes, sir. Uh... heh...

08:01.544 --> 08:03.880
the subspace transmissions
that, that Tyler sent,

08:03.966 --> 08:05.958
they went to 74 mark 5.6,

08:06.075 --> 08:08.263
which is bizarre, because
there-there's nothing there.

08:08.349 --> 08:10.162
Its just a bunch of empty
space and a penal colony

08:10.247 --> 08:11.747
that was abandoned
over 100 years ago.

08:11.863 --> 08:15.278
It's not abandoned.
Thats Section 31 headquarters.

08:15.814 --> 08:17.364
Where is Mr. Tyler,

08:17.450 --> 08:18.804
- by the way?
- Confined to quarters.

08:18.889 --> 08:20.269
He can't do any further damage.

08:20.356 --> 08:21.817
Start decrypting
those transmissions.

08:21.903 --> 08:23.050
We need to know
what he sent them.

08:23.135 --> 08:24.880
- Aye, sir.
- Lieutenant Detmer.

08:25.543 --> 08:27.419
Set a course for
Section 31 headquarters.

08:27.567 --> 08:29.172
Yes, Captain.

08:31.694 --> 08:33.311
Admiral, with your permission...

08:33.397 --> 08:35.215
The sooner we get there,
the better.

08:36.129 --> 08:37.426
Hit it.

10:03.373 --> 10:05.373
DISCOVERY*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 02 Episode 09</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Project Daedalus"</font>

10:21.856 --> 10:23.059
Okay... do you want

10:23.145 --> 10:24.387
- to say it or should I?
- You.

10:24.473 --> 10:26.856
- Okay...
- No, me! Uh, we eloped!

10:26.942 --> 10:28.801
Were married
to each other.

10:28.918 --> 10:30.814
He is officially my...

10:30.899 --> 10:32.746
Albatross.
Or ball and chain.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.871
- What have I done?
- What have you done?

10:35.371 --> 10:36.872
We just couldnt wait anymore,
you know?

10:36.957 --> 10:40.246
And well tell you all about it,
every sickeningly sweet detail.

10:40.332 --> 10:42.770
But first, we got to run.
Our shuttle boards in an hour.

10:42.856 --> 10:44.293
We are so excited to come back

10:44.379 --> 10:46.229
and celebrate with all of you
in person.

10:46.314 --> 10:48.574
I'm gonna cry.

10:48.660 --> 10:52.449
We've been gone so long.
But were coming home.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.199
Return to archive.

10:54.848 --> 10:56.717
Begin memory review.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.901
Delete.

11:01.034 --> 11:02.395
Delete.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.449
Wait, wait,
what-what do you mean?

11:04.535 --> 11:06.716
<i>I mean, I'm not playing Ka-dis-kot
with you anymore.</i>

11:06.802 --> 11:08.586
- Why?
- You know why.

11:08.671 --> 11:10.278
Its the same reason
I am not playing

11:10.364 --> 11:11.778
with her anymore, either.

11:11.864 --> 11:14.005
Tilly, you've
memorized every possible gambit.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.925
No, I have not.
Yes, I have.

11:16.010 --> 11:18.184
But so has Airiam.

11:18.473 --> 11:19.637
True.

11:19.894 --> 11:21.530
Save to archive.

11:28.402 --> 11:29.607
Dont hold back.

11:29.768 --> 11:31.676
Save to archive.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.213
Save to archive.

11:37.910 --> 11:39.436
Come in.

11:41.011 --> 11:42.085
Delete.

11:42.171 --> 11:45.004
You better be saving
every single Moment with me.

11:46.293 --> 11:47.496
Actually,

11:47.582 --> 11:49.760
<i>those memories are
always the first to go.</i>

11:49.845 --> 11:51.761
Oh.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.899
Kind of lucky you get to delete
everything you want to forget.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.957
If I could do that, I probably
wouldn't recognize my mother.

11:58.043 --> 11:59.459
You'd be less envious
if you had

11:59.545 --> 12:01.590
to go through
the process each week.

12:01.863 --> 12:03.199
It can be tedious.

12:03.324 --> 12:04.340
Still.

12:04.426 --> 12:06.621
Hey, is that... that new?

12:08.621 --> 12:11.457
I used to keep it... private.

12:12.175 --> 12:15.465
But I think I like
having it out now.

12:16.253 --> 12:17.780
Is this from the same beach?

12:21.486 --> 12:23.098
Our last day together.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.403
Our shuttle back home

12:31.489 --> 12:33.489
went down, and...

12:42.080 --> 12:43.861
Did you need me for something?

12:44.344 --> 12:46.009
Oh, yes. Um...

12:46.423 --> 12:47.540
decryption help.

12:47.626 --> 12:49.947
- Mm.
- The sooner the better, if you can.

12:51.743 --> 12:54.215
My memories
are not going anywhere.

12:56.837 --> 12:58.572
I would be happy to help.

12:59.470 --> 13:00.798
Youre fine.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.728
Youre fine.

13:03.087 --> 13:04.587
Youre fine.

13:04.908 --> 13:08.009
Come on, which one of you
is missing from my spore drive?

13:08.603 --> 13:09.707
Youre fine.

13:09.792 --> 13:11.251
Youre fine.

13:11.650 --> 13:13.775
Could one of you
say something, please?

13:13.962 --> 13:17.081
I don't like to listen to myself
talk when I have an audience.

13:17.798 --> 13:18.948
We're thinking, Commander.

13:19.126 --> 13:20.369
Think louder.

13:25.001 --> 13:26.189
We know of two occasions

13:26.330 --> 13:27.540
on which a signal was followed

13:27.626 --> 13:29.040
by the appearance
of the Red Angel:

13:29.133 --> 13:31.616
our mission to the asteroid,
and to Kaminar.

13:31.779 --> 13:33.595
But a signal appeared by itself

13:33.681 --> 13:35.439
- over Terralysium.
- And...

13:35.525 --> 13:37.986
there was no signal when the
Angel appeared to me as a boy.

13:38.189 --> 13:40.244
Or when it reappeared
to share its visions.

13:40.545 --> 13:42.087
Perhaps there is
a significance in them

13:42.173 --> 13:43.525
we have yet to understand.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.204
Is the Angel using
these signals,

13:45.290 --> 13:46.729
or the other way around?

13:52.056 --> 13:53.884
Your visions have
to contain something

13:53.970 --> 13:55.915
to help us understand
what the Angel wants.

13:56.126 --> 13:59.431
I told you, I believe it wants
to warn us, nothing more.

13:59.689 --> 14:02.290
<i>Nen lhómek I sk ávdu tsífuzin.</i>

14:03.236 --> 14:05.472
- "You are tending a plant that is dead.
- " I know what it means.

14:05.557 --> 14:07.315
Translation is not
the essence of understanding.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.033
Do you have
a better suggestion, Spock?

14:09.119 --> 14:12.033
My priority is to understand
why, of all sentient beings,

14:12.119 --> 14:13.573
the Angel chose
to communicate with me.

14:13.658 --> 14:15.387
So you think it wants something
from you personally?

14:15.472 --> 14:17.925
It showed me
an apocalyptic future.

14:18.207 --> 14:19.949
How I'm meant to prevent
that from occurring

14:20.035 --> 14:22.246
is something I cannot
logically reconcile.

14:29.144 --> 14:31.003
The purpose of logic

14:31.530 --> 14:34.160
is to problem-solve
in an uncertain environment.

14:35.246 --> 14:36.347
Maybe we need

14:36.433 --> 14:37.800
a little inspiration.

14:37.901 --> 14:40.488
Could you find that
inspiration somewhere else?

14:40.764 --> 14:43.730
It turns out your loud thinking
is distracting.

14:49.167 --> 14:50.519
You're fine.

14:50.824 --> 14:52.183
You're fine.

14:52.573 --> 14:53.824
You're fine.

14:54.854 --> 14:57.753
Now I understand why this
was so difficult for you.

14:58.066 --> 14:59.996
The key encryptions
are continually changing.

15:00.081 --> 15:01.664
Good thing youre half robot.

15:02.246 --> 15:04.800
I prefer "cybernetically
augmented," thank you very much.

15:04.886 --> 15:06.238
Three cheers for cybernetics!

15:06.324 --> 15:07.800
I don't know, Detmer. I mean,

15:07.886 --> 15:10.316
she hasn't actually
done anything yet, so...

15:10.535 --> 15:11.808
Oh.

15:14.824 --> 15:16.355
I stand corrected.

15:20.467 --> 15:22.339
Think you're pretty smart, huh?

15:23.542 --> 15:25.113
Airiam?

15:25.996 --> 15:27.550
I'm sorry, I was focused.

15:27.717 --> 15:29.402
This may take a while longer.

15:29.558 --> 15:30.934
Why don't you return
to your station

15:31.019 --> 15:32.753
in case the Captain needs
you for anything?

15:32.839 --> 15:35.667
Sure.
Um, thank you for everything.

15:38.374 --> 15:40.784
I'm dropping us out of
warp in ten minutes, sir.

15:40.917 --> 15:42.644
Pull up
defense schematics, please.

15:42.878 --> 15:44.199
Admiral.

15:44.397 --> 15:46.668
You want to tell us what kind of
shitstorm were flying into?

15:46.753 --> 15:47.964
Okay...

15:48.050 --> 15:50.316
welcome to Section 31
headquarters.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.113
Zoom in, please.

15:54.362 --> 15:56.784
As you can see,
it is heavily fortified

15:56.870 --> 15:57.925
on all sides.

15:58.011 --> 15:59.269
Are those mines?

15:59.372 --> 16:00.886
- They are.
- The Federation

16:00.972 --> 16:02.692
does not permit
the use of mines.

16:02.777 --> 16:04.230
No.

16:04.959 --> 16:06.128
No, they do not.

16:06.214 --> 16:07.574
The Federation didn't build them.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.340
I'd call that a distinction
without a difference.

16:09.425 --> 16:11.714
We were under attack
by Klingon warships

16:11.800 --> 16:13.707
with cloaking abilities.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.236
Sometimes in war,

16:15.322 --> 16:17.300
the terrible choice is
the only choice.

16:17.404 --> 16:19.574
Giving up our values
in the name of security

16:19.660 --> 16:21.477
is to lose the battle
in advance.

16:21.917 --> 16:24.292
Im curious, did you sideline

16:24.378 --> 16:25.403
<i>the Enterprise because you knew</i>

16:25.488 --> 16:26.649
I'd never stop
reminding you of that?

16:26.734 --> 16:28.300
You sat out the war...

16:28.920 --> 16:31.355
because if wed lost
to the Klingons,

16:31.598 --> 16:34.949
we wanted the best
of Starfleet to survive.

16:35.761 --> 16:38.191
And as this conversation
makes clear,

16:38.277 --> 16:39.464
that was you...

16:39.582 --> 16:41.496
and all you represent.

16:45.718 --> 16:47.105
Thank you.

16:47.814 --> 16:49.300
Youre welcome.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.473
Now, will you get off my ass

16:51.558 --> 16:53.003
so we can get back to work?

17:08.309 --> 17:09.724
Unlike Ensign Tilly,

17:09.810 --> 17:12.339
you seem to have no individual
expression whatsoever.

17:12.738 --> 17:14.886
It is quite an accomplishment
to be uniquely mundane.

17:15.002 --> 17:16.703
Well, I express myself
through my work,

17:16.789 --> 17:18.791
not my choice of decor.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.261
Clearly.

17:36.290 --> 17:39.166
I am attempting to understand
why the Red Angel chose me

17:39.252 --> 17:41.689
to expose a threat
to the entire galaxy...

17:41.939 --> 17:43.650
and your solution is
to play chess?

17:43.764 --> 17:46.861
When the Red Angel showed you
visions you couldnt reconcile,

17:47.220 --> 17:49.095
it caused you
to question your ability

17:49.249 --> 17:50.766
to examine the world logically.

17:50.851 --> 17:52.891
What better way
to return to logic

17:52.993 --> 17:55.562
than via the game
that represents it?

17:57.712 --> 17:59.477
It is arrogant of you to assert

17:59.563 --> 18:01.071
that my present manner
of thinking

18:01.157 --> 18:02.384
requires fixing at all.

18:02.470 --> 18:05.149
It is arrogant of you
to assert it doesn't.

18:08.927 --> 18:11.364
Or you're just afraid youll lose.

18:12.254 --> 18:14.071
All right, Michael...

18:14.274 --> 18:15.950
lets play chess.

18:51.186 --> 18:53.118
- Commander Airiam.
- Hello, Nhan.

18:53.204 --> 18:55.382
- May I help you?
- Tilly was looking for you.

18:56.375 --> 18:57.498
What are you doing?

18:57.584 --> 19:00.009
Searching for data to
help with the decryption.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.189
For all the benefits
of my augmentation,

19:02.275 --> 19:04.720
its storage capacity
is not infinite.

19:06.743 --> 19:09.353
Your species is Barzan, yes?

19:09.439 --> 19:11.123
- Yes.
- Your augmentation

19:11.331 --> 19:13.947
allows you to breathe
in our atmosphere?

19:14.033 --> 19:15.673
And why are you asking?

19:16.165 --> 19:17.462
Curiosity.

19:29.980 --> 19:32.316
I should return to the bridge.

19:37.883 --> 19:39.587
Oh. I am so glad youre back.

19:39.673 --> 19:42.316
Uh, whatever you did before,
its not working anymore.

19:42.495 --> 19:44.501
- I don't understand.
- Yeah, neither do I.

19:44.587 --> 19:46.368
I mean, its like the system knew

19:46.454 --> 19:48.509
we were trying to crack it,
and it changed its tactics.

19:48.594 --> 19:51.508
But thats impossible, because
its automated, its not alive.

19:51.594 --> 19:52.665
Right?

19:55.782 --> 19:57.727
I'd like you
to stand beside me.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.172
Do not move until weve
solved this problem.

20:00.289 --> 20:01.738
Do you understand?

20:01.899 --> 20:03.865
- No, that's okay, you've got this.
- Please...

20:04.101 --> 20:05.625
Tilly.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.657
Um... yeah, okay.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.829
Commander.

20:15.662 --> 20:17.836
Dropping us out
of warp now, Captain.

20:27.282 --> 20:29.285
Mr. Bryce... open a channel.

20:29.524 --> 20:31.118
Tell Section 31 that Starfleets

20:31.204 --> 20:32.978
- most wanted vessel is here.
- Captain,

20:33.063 --> 20:34.696
sensors show all mines
are fully armed.

20:34.821 --> 20:36.164
No response
to our hails, Captain.

20:36.282 --> 20:38.227
They must be too busy
planning the welcome party.

20:38.329 --> 20:40.563
Are you sure you can get us
through these defenses?

20:40.649 --> 20:42.352
I wouldn't risk it otherwise.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.571
Oh. My mission, your ship.

20:48.024 --> 20:49.031
Lieutenant Detmer,

20:49.117 --> 20:50.782
sending the route to you now.

20:55.164 --> 20:57.047
Oh, one other thing
I should mention.

20:57.407 --> 20:59.344
The shields
will have to be down.

21:00.696 --> 21:01.749
Why?

21:01.835 --> 21:03.515
The mines are attracted to them.

21:04.079 --> 21:05.922
Nothing's ever easy.

21:06.736 --> 21:08.938
Lower shields
and take us closer.

21:27.843 --> 21:31.422
If there's a logical reason
to sacrifice your rook,

21:31.508 --> 21:33.389
I fail to see it.

21:33.977 --> 21:36.258
Perhaps I simply dislike rooks.

21:36.407 --> 21:39.438
Perhaps... you're trying to lose.

21:39.836 --> 21:41.907
An odd supposition
given that I am

21:41.993 --> 21:44.274
a willing participant
in the game.

21:51.274 --> 21:53.941
Sarek taught me
a more elegant strategy...

21:54.632 --> 21:56.352
first day I played.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.602
There are other strategies
that our father,

21:58.688 --> 22:01.249
in his single-mindedness,
chooses to ignore.

22:08.025 --> 22:10.353
I think our father
would be disappointed

22:10.439 --> 22:12.494
in your lack of effort,
don't you?

22:12.759 --> 22:14.205
I disappoint him,

22:14.337 --> 22:16.072
he disappoints me,

22:16.166 --> 22:18.056
the sun sets, a new day begins.

22:18.142 --> 22:19.701
Oh, you're a philosopher now.

22:19.786 --> 22:21.135
And you're a human,

22:21.400 --> 22:24.095
and you cannot presume
to know Sareks mind.

22:37.287 --> 22:39.954
The next logical move
would be for your knight

22:40.040 --> 22:41.603
to take my pawn.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.455
Seriously, what are you doing?

22:50.541 --> 22:51.998
Disrupting your expectations.

22:52.084 --> 22:53.736
I'm trying to help you, Spock.

22:53.821 --> 22:55.731
I do not need your help,
Michael.

22:58.629 --> 23:00.856
Our Captain says you do.

23:01.667 --> 23:02.744
You are the only one

23:02.830 --> 23:04.731
who has had contact
with the Red Angel.

23:05.215 --> 23:08.364
You said you don't
understand why it chose you.

23:08.854 --> 23:10.825
Thats where we need to start.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.426
And logic <i>will</i> help.

23:13.512 --> 23:17.309
I understand now.
If only I'd taken your pawn,

23:17.395 --> 23:18.387
the mystery would be solved.

23:18.473 --> 23:20.676
I refuse to take
this posturing seriously.

23:20.762 --> 23:22.130
Its entirely out of character.

23:22.216 --> 23:24.565
We've not seen each other
in years.

23:24.901 --> 23:27.246
You've no foundation
for judging my character.

23:27.871 --> 23:29.301
Yet here you are,

23:29.551 --> 23:31.573
full of self-importance...

23:32.207 --> 23:34.221
once again taking responsibility

23:34.307 --> 23:36.450
for that which is
beyond your control.

23:38.098 --> 23:40.684
My perception of reality
was challenged by visions

23:40.770 --> 23:42.668
from a time-traveling entity.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.989
Who should help me
but you, of course.

23:45.152 --> 23:47.574
After all, the entire
Klingon War was your doing.

23:47.661 --> 23:48.747
- No.
- Even your parents death

23:48.832 --> 23:50.340
- was your responsibility.
- Stop it.

23:50.426 --> 23:53.262
If only you hadnt asked to
watch a star become supernova.

23:53.590 --> 23:55.543
But you're wise
to blame yourself.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.840
Children should know
when a warfaring race

23:57.926 --> 23:59.184
will attack without warning.

23:59.270 --> 24:00.825
Perhaps you could
have done something.

24:00.911 --> 24:03.226
A child fighting a Klingon...
those are excellent odds.

24:03.312 --> 24:04.548
Shut up!

24:06.246 --> 24:08.715
You were trapped on the other
side of a door, Michael.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.815
<i>You could not stop any of it.</i>

24:20.317 --> 24:21.866
<i>You could not save them.</i>

24:22.309 --> 24:25.512
It is unreasonable for you
to believe otherwise, yet you do.

24:25.598 --> 24:28.614
As you believed you could save
my family from logic extremists,

24:28.809 --> 24:31.800
when in truth they
despised us because of me...

24:32.278 --> 24:34.590
the half-human abomination.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.684
Your presence
was beside the point.

24:37.770 --> 24:39.701
Whatever point you're trying
to make, youre failing.

24:39.786 --> 24:43.512
Then let me be clear.
You avoid reality

24:43.598 --> 24:45.581
because it is easier for you
to shoulder burden

24:45.666 --> 24:48.192
than to face unimaginable grief.

24:52.777 --> 24:54.404
I thought this could be
a new start for us.

24:54.489 --> 24:55.823
I really did.

24:56.793 --> 24:58.231
Clearly, I was wrong.

24:58.325 --> 25:00.067
Yes, you were.

25:00.309 --> 25:01.793
We will never relate as equals

25:01.911 --> 25:04.379
so long as you attempt to assume
every burden as yours alone.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.543
Since were being honest
with each other,

25:06.762 --> 25:09.582
you need to stop taking
whatever this is out on me.

25:09.900 --> 25:12.035
You need to identify
why youre really angry.

25:12.121 --> 25:14.042
There is nothing to identify.

25:14.668 --> 25:16.786
I am angry, pure and simple.

25:16.894 --> 25:19.231
Because you feel like you failed
as a Vulcan or as a human?

25:19.317 --> 25:22.192
What I feel
is that failure is liberating.

25:22.417 --> 25:25.879
And for the first time,
I enjoy expressing emotion.

25:41.526 --> 25:42.771
<i>Commander Burnham,</i>

25:42.856 --> 25:44.205
<i>we need you on the bridge.</i>

25:49.777 --> 25:51.364
I'm on my way.

26:00.911 --> 26:03.817
Yellow alert. Take us in.

26:16.770 --> 26:18.614
Thats the most
defensive weapons I've ever seen

26:18.700 --> 26:21.551
- in one place.
- Welcome to Section 31 headquarters.

26:21.792 --> 26:23.645
No one from Control
will answer our hails.

26:23.731 --> 26:24.817
Scans show no life signs,

26:24.903 --> 26:26.107
but it is a former prison, so...

26:26.192 --> 26:27.794
So it would have been designed
to prevent such scans

26:27.879 --> 26:30.153
- from working.
- Find a work-around.

26:30.239 --> 26:31.786
I need to know
what were walking into.

26:31.871 --> 26:34.473
- I'll do what I can, sir.
- Are you all right?

26:34.890 --> 26:36.528
I'm fine.

26:41.776 --> 26:42.948
Ensign Tilly,

26:43.036 --> 26:44.419
have you decrypted
those messages yet?

26:44.504 --> 26:45.762
Moving as fast as we can, sir.

26:45.848 --> 26:47.231
- Move faster.
- Captain.

26:47.317 --> 26:48.950
We have a problem incoming.

26:49.082 --> 26:50.403
Blade Mines.

26:50.489 --> 26:51.981
They'll slice the hull
like cheese.

26:52.067 --> 26:55.043
It appears that someone is
guiding them directly toward us.

26:55.503 --> 26:57.832
That shouldn't even be possible.

27:05.078 --> 27:06.528
Apparently it is.

27:06.894 --> 27:08.144
Shields up. Red alert.

27:10.446 --> 27:12.285
This is your Captain.

27:12.519 --> 27:14.229
Brace for a bumpy ride.

27:20.246 --> 27:22.004
Shields holding at 90%.

27:22.090 --> 27:23.858
Begin evasive maneuvers.

27:25.124 --> 27:26.240
Pattern lambda ten.

27:26.325 --> 27:27.559
Yes, sir.

27:33.833 --> 27:35.895
You should go help now.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.926
But you said not to leave.

27:38.104 --> 27:40.621
I've got this. And they need you.

27:42.192 --> 27:43.761
Okay.

27:49.537 --> 27:51.567
I can't shake these
Blade Mines, Captain.

27:51.653 --> 27:54.169
Whoever's controlling them seem
to be anticipating our moves.

27:54.254 --> 27:56.129
Switch to pattern gamma four.

28:19.513 --> 28:21.793
Someone reprogrammed the mines.
I can't shut them off.

28:22.014 --> 28:23.660
Mr. Bryce,
contact Starfleet Command.

28:23.746 --> 28:26.137
Tell them to order
Section 31 to stand down.

28:32.258 --> 28:34.442
Sensors are saying
that were upside down.

28:34.527 --> 28:36.844
Those are blackout mines.
They interfere with navigation.

28:38.245 --> 28:39.789
Blackout mines?

28:39.875 --> 28:42.983
- The helm is not responding.
- It is, Lieutenant.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.773
You're flying blind,
just like in the Academy.

28:57.031 --> 28:58.696
Shields down to 41%.

28:58.782 --> 29:00.200
No response from Starfleet, sir.

29:00.286 --> 29:01.415
Keep trying.
Lieutenant Detmer...

29:01.500 --> 29:02.797
I'm trying my best, Captain.

29:02.883 --> 29:04.781
Not good enough.
This isn't a game.

29:06.959 --> 29:09.387
Wait. What if it is?

29:14.066 --> 29:16.118
- Quickly.
- If the mines are reprogrammed,

29:16.203 --> 29:17.294
they're being guided
by a computer.

29:17.379 --> 29:19.153
And like a game,
after a few moves,

29:19.239 --> 29:21.208
it anticipates what well do.

29:23.372 --> 29:24.465
Recommendations?

29:24.551 --> 29:27.473
We need to introduce
randomness and chaos, sir.

29:31.794 --> 29:34.614
Lieutenant Detmer,
trust your training.

29:34.700 --> 29:35.871
You can do this.

29:35.969 --> 29:38.111
- Mr. Saru, we need an evasive pattern.
- Uh.

29:38.206 --> 29:39.973
Beta nine, Detmer.

30:02.983 --> 30:04.420
Admiral.

30:04.563 --> 30:06.155
Pi alpha two.

30:22.879 --> 30:24.198
Commander Burnham.

30:24.284 --> 30:25.700
Delta seven.

30:32.379 --> 30:33.450
Lieutenant Owosekun.

30:33.536 --> 30:34.919
Omega one.

31:13.553 --> 31:15.098
Theyre moving away from us,
Captain.

31:15.184 --> 31:16.786
- Injuries?
- Five, sir.

31:16.872 --> 31:18.506
All from the engine room.
No casualties.

31:18.591 --> 31:20.700
- Damage report?
- Warp and impulse engines

31:20.786 --> 31:22.083
are inoperable, sir.

31:22.227 --> 31:23.567
It's as if we were targeted.

31:23.708 --> 31:24.981
And now were sitting ducks.

31:25.067 --> 31:26.895
Sir, we're being hailed
by Section 31.

31:26.981 --> 31:29.083
Its Admiral Patar.

31:30.770 --> 31:32.520
Cancel red alert.

31:36.036 --> 31:37.801
Put her through.

31:39.496 --> 31:42.293
What the hell are you doing,
attacking a Federation starship?

31:42.482 --> 31:45.372
My apologies, Admiral. Captain.

31:45.465 --> 31:48.004
But <i>Discovery</i> is presently
harboring wanted criminals

31:48.090 --> 31:49.981
and is, itself,
a fugitive vessel.

31:50.129 --> 31:51.395
It was deemed too dangerous

31:51.481 --> 31:53.262
to allow you
in proximity to our base.

31:53.348 --> 31:55.575
We'll see what Starfleet has
to say. Lieutenant Bryce?

31:55.661 --> 31:57.344
I'm sorry, sir. They're-they're
still not responding.

31:57.429 --> 31:58.872
That is because
my order to attack

31:58.958 --> 32:01.418
came directly
from Starfleet Command.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.911
If Starfleet ordered an attack,
they can damn well say it

32:18.997 --> 32:20.380
- to my face.
- Captain Pike,

32:20.465 --> 32:22.731
please do not escalate
this situation further.

32:23.004 --> 32:25.762
A Section 31 vessel is en route.
You will be boarded.

32:25.848 --> 32:27.898
- For what reason?
- Starfleet regulations

32:27.984 --> 32:30.872
are extremely specific
about the definition of treason.

32:31.068 --> 32:33.043
Unfortunately, you, your crew

32:33.129 --> 32:34.481
and the admiral all qualify.

32:34.567 --> 32:37.752
If you think youre coming
to arrest us, think again.

32:37.838 --> 32:39.856
Admiral, I do believe

32:39.942 --> 32:42.333
<i>you went to
Discovery with noble intentions.</i>

32:42.801 --> 32:44.981
However,
by abandoning your duties

32:45.067 --> 32:46.896
to carry out a secret mission
with fugitives,

32:47.151 --> 32:49.356
you became a fugitive yourself.

32:49.692 --> 32:52.997
You no longer have the authority
to choose your own fate.

32:58.129 --> 33:00.845
I understand this is more
than you bargained for,

33:01.383 --> 33:03.965
but you cannot abandon
the mission, Chris.

33:04.231 --> 33:06.270
Whether I can
issue orders or not,

33:06.356 --> 33:09.450
we have to get a team onto
that station and reset Control.

33:09.551 --> 33:11.200
What is it
about the look on my face

33:11.286 --> 33:13.145
that suggests
I've changed my mind?

33:17.075 --> 33:18.356
Lieutenant Rhys,

33:18.442 --> 33:20.192
scan for any other weapons
on this base.

33:20.278 --> 33:22.590
And call down to engineering.
We need that spore drive

33:22.676 --> 33:23.965
up and running.
Mr. Saru,

33:24.051 --> 33:26.011
form a landing party
and meet us in my ready room.

33:26.131 --> 33:29.286
Uh, Captain, I believe
I can be more helpful here.

33:29.403 --> 33:30.966
There is something I would
like to investigate.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.231
Get to it, then.

33:32.317 --> 33:33.731
Commander Burnham, youre up.

33:38.634 --> 33:40.786
Okay.

33:42.513 --> 33:44.325
Come on.

33:45.475 --> 33:47.168
Please don't shock me.

33:47.339 --> 33:50.317
You do realize inanimate
infrastructure cannot hear you.

33:50.751 --> 33:53.426
Really? You're kidding.

33:53.933 --> 33:55.207
Sorry, darling.

33:55.293 --> 33:57.177
He just does not understand.

33:57.395 --> 33:59.153
Ow!

34:00.364 --> 34:01.661
Great.

34:02.158 --> 34:04.348
Now there's a power short

34:04.452 --> 34:05.575
on top of everything else.

34:05.661 --> 34:07.434
This makes my work impossible.

34:07.644 --> 34:09.652
And I am not being
hyperbolic when I say

34:09.739 --> 34:11.355
the future of the
galaxy is at stake.

34:11.618 --> 34:13.090
Well, uh...

34:13.176 --> 34:17.033
unless I can reroute power
to the adjacent conduit,

34:17.119 --> 34:20.583
isolate the corruption,
fix it and the spore drive,

34:20.810 --> 34:23.062
were all gonna
get arrested, so...

34:23.551 --> 34:27.020
if you want to save the galaxy,
start by helping me.

34:27.808 --> 34:29.239
A fair point.

34:38.551 --> 34:40.824
I didn't know you knew
anything about electrical.

34:40.934 --> 34:42.661
I have many talents.

34:43.389 --> 34:45.150
Point the light over here,
please.

34:47.377 --> 34:48.911
So, did, uh...

34:49.024 --> 34:50.864
Burnhams idea help?

34:51.418 --> 34:54.715
Did you figure out why
the Red Angel chose you?

34:54.879 --> 34:56.402
No.

34:57.528 --> 34:59.231
I have examined it
from countless angles,

34:59.317 --> 35:00.872
yet I remain
an illogical choice.

35:01.284 --> 35:04.825
Well, have you thought
about what makes you unique?

35:05.756 --> 35:07.457
I am half-human.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.583
Unusual, but there are
others like me.

35:11.561 --> 35:13.137
I can think of nothing else.

35:13.223 --> 35:16.242
Well, if I were a Red Angel

35:16.385 --> 35:17.683
traveling through time,

35:17.902 --> 35:21.004
I'd plan my mind-melding
strategy pretty carefully.

35:21.300 --> 35:22.504
Wouldn't just...

35:22.706 --> 35:24.988
choose a random Vulcan.

35:26.632 --> 35:28.652
Keep trying. Youll
figure it out.

35:34.063 --> 35:35.746
Thank you.

35:36.254 --> 35:39.660
Now, if only the spore
drive were that easy.

35:39.857 --> 35:44.090
I think the corruption
might be with the navigator,

35:44.176 --> 35:47.527
which, you know,
isnt important at all.

35:48.264 --> 35:51.113
It just holds the map
to the entire mycelial network.

35:51.199 --> 35:53.675
You have traveled that
network hundreds of times.

35:53.855 --> 35:55.129
Surely you know it well enough

35:55.215 --> 35:57.535
to travel between two
points without assistance.

35:58.133 --> 36:01.152
Perhaps you simply lack
faith in your own abilities.

36:12.095 --> 36:15.300
I know youre angry with Burnham,

36:15.619 --> 36:18.480
but she risked her life
to bring you here.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.465
She loves you.

36:25.215 --> 36:29.465
If I may make an observation
of my own...

36:30.448 --> 36:33.363
I saw Dr. Culber moving out
of your shared quarters.

36:34.004 --> 36:36.082
You seemed quite upset.

36:37.273 --> 36:39.589
Yes, he said he needs distance.

36:39.675 --> 36:42.893
I submit that your assessment of
the situation may be inverted.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.448
Perhaps he needs distance
from you

36:45.560 --> 36:47.955
not because he no longer
has feelings for you,

36:48.391 --> 36:51.799
but because he no longer knows
how to feel about himself.

36:53.546 --> 36:56.588
<i>Power and life support
systems are disabled everywhere</i>

36:56.674 --> 36:58.859
except for the Data Center
where Control is located.

36:58.961 --> 37:01.110
So well have to beam over
in EV suits.

37:01.226 --> 37:04.010
Because the politics
werent complicated enough.

37:04.375 --> 37:06.479
Any idea how many
guards to expect?

37:06.622 --> 37:08.854
I havent been on the site
since before the war.

37:08.940 --> 37:11.401
Your guess is as good as
mine. Probably better.

37:11.487 --> 37:13.588
Minimize the risks
as much as possible.

37:13.787 --> 37:14.971
Lieutenant Detmer,

37:15.057 --> 37:17.455
do your best to keep us in
range. Commander Airiam,

37:17.588 --> 37:19.306
once they've secured
the Data Center,

37:19.392 --> 37:20.772
you'll beam over and restore.

37:20.857 --> 37:22.275
Admiral Cornwells
access to Control.

37:22.361 --> 37:23.791
Sir, I should go with them.

37:23.877 --> 37:26.205
If the threat assessment
system has backup protections,

37:26.291 --> 37:29.476
I can circumvent them before
we lose access entirely.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.025
I'll look after her, Captain.

37:32.510 --> 37:33.713
Okay.

37:33.899 --> 37:36.166
Good luck, everyone. Dismissed.

37:37.174 --> 37:38.986
Look at you, going
off on a mission.

37:39.143 --> 37:40.541
Dont forget about
us little people.

37:40.627 --> 37:43.541
- I will do my best, Kayla.
- Mm-hmm.

38:05.812 --> 38:08.897
Captain, still no life signs,
and gravity is out.

38:09.373 --> 38:10.908
<i>Please be careful</i>.

38:10.994 --> 38:12.996
<i>Standing by to beam you out.</i>

38:30.577 --> 38:32.478
That's frozen blood.

38:32.635 --> 38:34.760
Well, that can't bode well.

38:36.666 --> 38:38.106
Burnham to <i>Discovery.</i>

38:38.192 --> 38:40.127
Confirm visuals on EV suits.

38:40.904 --> 38:42.658
We see you all
in the corridor, Commander.

38:42.744 --> 38:44.161
Proceed with caution.

38:44.271 --> 38:45.773
Yes, sir.

38:47.806 --> 38:50.321
Commander Nhan,
can you find a way

38:50.416 --> 38:52.088
to turn life support back on?

38:54.009 --> 38:56.510
I'll be back in two seconds
if you need anything.

38:58.887 --> 39:00.713
Lets stay close.

39:04.299 --> 39:06.783
Captain, I'm seeing clear signs
of a struggle.

39:06.872 --> 39:08.635
There's more blood.

39:09.057 --> 39:11.635
Looks like someone was trying
to pry these doors open,

39:11.728 --> 39:13.848
- or keep them from shutting.
- Any sense

39:13.934 --> 39:15.744
of who was fighting whom?

39:16.345 --> 39:18.348
Not yet.

39:35.537 --> 39:37.412
What do you think killed him?

39:47.186 --> 39:48.866
Thats a really good question.

39:49.218 --> 39:51.592
Restoring power and gravity now,
Commander.

40:07.186 --> 40:09.327
<i>Burnham to Discovery.
At least four dead.</i>

40:09.413 --> 40:10.928
Im guessing we'll find more.

40:11.077 --> 40:12.100
But we've got gravity

40:12.186 --> 40:14.021
and atmosphere restored.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.514
Biometric data indicates

40:35.600 --> 40:38.733
the victim died at
least two weeks ago.

40:41.288 --> 40:43.366
Bodies are frozen solid.

40:57.099 --> 40:59.233
Captain, we have a problem.

41:03.311 --> 41:04.736
Its Admiral Patar.

41:04.821 --> 41:06.788
She's been dead two weeks.

41:06.881 --> 41:10.307
If she's dead,
who the hell was I talking to?

41:10.514 --> 41:11.876
Captain,

41:12.006 --> 41:14.210
I believe
I can answer that question.

41:16.608 --> 41:20.061
Look, as you know, all living
beings have a heat signature,

41:20.147 --> 41:22.653
which changes
in high-stress situations.

41:23.530 --> 41:26.436
When Admiral Patar's authority
was challenged,

41:26.522 --> 41:29.367
I should have seen a change
in her signature,

41:29.496 --> 41:31.071
but I did not.

41:32.016 --> 41:35.719
As she was a hologram,
I now understand why.

41:36.219 --> 41:39.781
Now... here is

41:40.110 --> 41:42.649
the evidence against Mr. Spock.

41:45.363 --> 41:47.938
In ultraviolet.

41:50.539 --> 41:54.649
No changes despite
the violent attack.

41:55.172 --> 41:58.235
This, too, is a hologram.

41:58.523 --> 42:00.070
Which can only mean.

42:00.156 --> 42:03.149
Section 31 framed Mr. Spock.

42:04.156 --> 42:06.352
Control was programmed

42:06.438 --> 42:08.360
to create this evidence.

42:08.651 --> 42:11.469
After killing the admirals,
it used the same skill

42:11.555 --> 42:14.008
to create Admiral Patar.

42:14.375 --> 42:16.555
We're fighting the system itself.

42:17.180 --> 42:18.469
Which would explain

42:18.602 --> 42:20.977
why Admiral Cornwell
was locked out.

42:21.461 --> 42:24.305
Control could also be
blocking our transmissions

42:24.391 --> 42:25.555
to Starfleet Command.

42:25.641 --> 42:29.055
Then why would it allow us
to send a team onto the station?

42:29.644 --> 42:31.781
It must want something from us.

42:32.039 --> 42:34.813
Actually, I think it might
want something from Airiam.

42:38.680 --> 42:39.964
She downloaded all of her

42:40.049 --> 42:42.141
archived data,
all of her memories

42:42.250 --> 42:43.696
<i>onto Discovery.</i>

42:43.805 --> 42:45.469
None of it is
in her head anymore, and

42:45.598 --> 42:47.985
those memories meant everything
to her.

42:49.117 --> 42:51.110
Find out what she downloaded
in their place.

42:51.196 --> 42:52.805
Lieutenant Bryce,
open a secure channel

42:52.891 --> 42:54.813
to Burnham and Nhan only.

42:54.930 --> 42:56.984
Mr. Stamets, how are we
doing on that spore drive?

42:57.070 --> 42:58.306
I'll be ready when you are, sir.

42:58.391 --> 43:00.421
Good, because we might need it
very soon.

43:31.945 --> 43:33.305
Looks like they were trying

43:33.391 --> 43:35.250
to turn life support systems
back on again.

43:35.336 --> 43:37.914
The door's closed on them
deliberately.

43:39.633 --> 43:42.164
What could cause an entire
station to malfunction?

43:42.250 --> 43:43.906
<i>Commander Burnham,
Commander Nhan,</i>

43:43.992 --> 43:45.375
<i>youre on with the Captain.</i>

43:45.461 --> 43:46.656
Commander,

43:46.742 --> 43:48.031
what is Airiam doing?

43:48.116 --> 43:50.568
Trying to restore
Admiral Cornwells access to Control.

43:50.653 --> 43:53.122
<i>No, she's not. Stop her... now!</i>

43:57.220 --> 43:59.016
What the hell was that?

44:10.866 --> 44:12.956
Airiam, what are you doing?

44:13.042 --> 44:15.392
Commander Airiam, stand down.
That is an order.

44:15.477 --> 44:16.693
Do you hear me?

44:16.778 --> 44:18.513
I said stand down!

44:19.781 --> 44:21.598
Commander Airiam,
I need you to stop.

45:08.231 --> 45:10.111
Burnham?

45:40.974 --> 45:42.660
Burnham, are you all right?

45:43.027 --> 45:44.582
- Michael?
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

45:44.800 --> 45:46.855
I'm fine. What the hell is

45:46.972 --> 45:49.199
- happening to her?
- Airiam's compromised.

45:49.285 --> 45:51.075
Somethings controlling her
through her augmentation.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.169
Sir, do you remember the Sphere?
It was... it was dying.

45:53.254 --> 45:55.137
- It had a lot of data.
- I was there. Get to the point.

45:55.222 --> 45:57.230
Okay, well, the messages
to Section 31...

45:57.316 --> 45:59.636
they contained data
from the Sphere.

46:01.168 --> 46:03.667
That's the data that Airiam
downloaded before leaving.

46:03.918 --> 46:05.972
What did she bring over here?

46:06.058 --> 46:07.301
<i>All the information the Spher</i> e

46:07.386 --> 46:09.457
has ever collected
on artificial intelligence.

46:09.660 --> 46:11.709
Why would Control want AI data?

46:11.925 --> 46:13.886
A strategic advantage, perhaps.

46:14.550 --> 46:16.496
That Sphere collected data from

46:16.582 --> 46:19.511
countless civilizations over
hundreds of thousands of years.

46:19.597 --> 46:21.199
That much knowledge...

46:21.285 --> 46:23.269
whatever the problem,
you could never outthink it.

46:23.355 --> 46:24.410
It would always win.

46:24.496 --> 46:25.756
Oh, thats it.

46:25.863 --> 46:27.591
<i>It wants to think.</i>

46:28.144 --> 46:29.660
It wants to evolve.

46:29.746 --> 46:31.963
That data's like a roadmap
for Control to become

46:32.048 --> 46:33.316
fully conscious.

46:34.074 --> 46:35.133
When it does...

46:35.218 --> 46:37.568
It can destroy all other
sentient life in the galaxy.

46:37.722 --> 46:40.133
Yes. That's what Spock saw
in his vision.

46:42.464 --> 46:45.004
I'll delete
whatever she managed to upload.

46:48.362 --> 46:51.182
Ugh! Damn it! I can't get in!

46:53.870 --> 46:55.370
Can you delete the data
remotely?

46:55.456 --> 46:56.620
I can't access the system,

46:56.705 --> 46:59.229
and I definitely
can't hack Airiam.

47:08.617 --> 47:10.733
She's trying to open the door
from the inside!

47:10.819 --> 47:12.979
- We can't let her do that.
- I could... Maybe I...

47:13.089 --> 47:15.006
If you have any ideas.

47:16.362 --> 47:17.735
Open a channel to Airiam,

47:17.821 --> 47:19.316
please?

47:21.988 --> 47:23.222
You're on.

47:23.308 --> 47:24.558
Thanks. Uh...

47:24.667 --> 47:26.706
Airiam, hi. Its Tilly.

47:27.081 --> 47:29.058
Uh, just a friendly reminder

47:29.144 --> 47:31.886
that you saved every
memory you ever had with me.

47:33.687 --> 47:36.034
I think that's because
you adored me.

47:37.894 --> 47:40.229
And I adore you, too.

47:41.003 --> 47:42.886
I'm gonna send you something.

47:43.845 --> 47:46.362
Whatever this thing
is making you do,

47:46.495 --> 47:48.377
this is not who you are.

47:48.606 --> 47:51.979
You are a...
a Starfleet officer.

47:52.128 --> 47:55.013
You're an amazing colleague,
and you are a great friend.

47:55.409 --> 47:58.065
And also, like, the best
Kadis-kot player Ive ever seen.

47:58.151 --> 48:01.065
And I should know. I won
regionals when I was, like, ten.

48:02.673 --> 48:03.889
Airiam,

48:04.182 --> 48:05.990
this is not you. Please.

48:06.416 --> 48:08.034
You know Michael.

48:08.330 --> 48:09.948
Shes your friend.

48:12.147 --> 48:14.409
Airiam, I know you can hear me.

48:16.385 --> 48:17.968
I can hear you, Tilly!

48:18.053 --> 48:20.455
But I cannot stop myself.

48:20.557 --> 48:23.354
Its overriding
my primary motor functions.

48:23.478 --> 48:27.498
I was only able to transfer
25% of the AI data.

48:27.663 --> 48:29.807
Control needs me to finish.

48:33.101 --> 48:34.846
Michael,

48:35.193 --> 48:37.791
you have to open the airlock.

48:38.120 --> 48:39.307
Immediately.

48:39.393 --> 48:40.835
What?

48:41.080 --> 48:42.557
No!

48:43.018 --> 48:45.479
No, I'm not gonna
eject you into space!

48:45.565 --> 48:47.142
I will unlock this door,

48:47.877 --> 48:49.776
I will kill you,

48:50.088 --> 48:51.931
finish my mission.

48:52.241 --> 48:53.509
Then I will destroy.

48:53.604 --> 48:54.954
<i>Discovery.</i>

48:58.541 --> 49:01.080
And all on board will die.

49:02.707 --> 49:04.575
Please, Michael.

49:06.479 --> 49:08.002
The airlock.

49:08.253 --> 49:10.096
We can fight this, Airiam.

49:11.029 --> 49:13.166
Commander Burnham,
what are you doing?

49:13.424 --> 49:15.292
The system corrupted her.
If I can break in, and...

49:15.377 --> 49:16.963
and take it offline,
shell be free.

49:17.905 --> 49:19.565
Michael, stop.

49:19.651 --> 49:21.565
I disabled my helmet.

49:21.879 --> 49:23.863
I will not survive in space.

49:24.948 --> 49:26.749
Commander Burnham.

49:27.715 --> 49:28.885
Open the airlock.

49:28.990 --> 49:31.213
Captain, I don't want
to disobey your orders,

49:31.599 --> 49:32.557
but if this works...

49:32.643 --> 49:33.976
Its her or you, Michael.

49:34.062 --> 49:35.666
15 seconds.

49:35.907 --> 49:37.057
Please!

49:37.165 --> 49:38.760
Open the airlock, Michael.

49:38.846 --> 49:40.862
One more minute! Please!

49:40.948 --> 49:42.299
Hey, Airiam,

49:42.385 --> 49:45.635
I'm gonna send you your favorite
memory, okay? Look at it.

49:45.727 --> 49:48.916
I can't look at it now, Tilly.
Michael!

49:49.011 --> 49:53.073
You have no other alternative
but to eject me!

49:53.159 --> 49:54.698
Burnham, that's an order.

49:58.468 --> 50:00.284
I'm so sorry.

50:00.370 --> 50:02.272
It wanted me to kill you.

50:02.370 --> 50:04.008
Everything is because of you.

50:04.182 --> 50:05.335
Because of me?

50:05.428 --> 50:06.979
Michael,

50:07.147 --> 50:08.330
open the airlock.

50:08.416 --> 50:10.495
Please tell everyone
I love them.

50:12.199 --> 50:14.588
You have to find
Project Daedalus.

50:14.689 --> 50:15.855
Where is Project Dae...

51:33.182 --> 51:35.551
But were coming home.
