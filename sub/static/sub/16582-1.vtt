Man #2: <i>"One of a kind"

Never has been,

So, along with former Governor
of New Mexico Bill Richardson

00:34.787 --> 00:37.812
and the great Mayor of
New York Rudy Giuliani,

00:38.246 --> 00:40.760
it is my honor to present to you

00:40.908 --> 00:45.472
our two-term former President
of the United States,

00:45.473 --> 00:47.241
- Richard Graves.

- Hi.
- May I help you, sir?

03:46.830 --> 03:48.787
Yes, I'm here to see President Graves.

03:48.788 --> 03:50.871
I'm Isaiah Miller, his new assistant.

03:53.663 --> 03:56.995
(laughs)

03:56.996 --> 04:01.455
Uh, okay, go ahead.

04:08.163 --> 04:11.019
- Michael Steele called again.
- Oh, good. I'll call him later.

04:12.411 --> 04:14.620
Isaiah Miller.

04:14.996 --> 04:16.713
I hope you're ready for this.

04:16.738 --> 04:19.161
I have never been more ready to do
anything in my life, ma'am.

04:19.163 --> 04:21.786
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

04:21.788 --> 04:24.859
You come highly recommended by
my friends at the Cato Institute.

04:24.860 --> 04:26.954
They wouldn't stop singing your praises.

04:26.955 --> 04:28.688
Well, for the record, ma'am,
I just want you to know

04:28.746 --> 04:30.829
that President Graves has been
the single seminal influence

04:30.830 --> 04:32.454
on my political and worldview.

04:32.455 --> 04:34.787
- I mean, his presidency...
- Don't do that.

04:34.788 --> 04:38.079
Don't romanticize. This isn't fun.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.538
- Oh.
- <i>(door opens)</i>

04:39.539 --> 04:41.787
Graves: <i>Never again, Maggie.</i>

04:41.788 --> 04:43.245
Never.

04:43.246 --> 04:45.662
- Maggie.
- Hey, darling.

04:45.663 --> 04:48.787
No more appearances
with political types.

04:48.788 --> 04:52.829
It is so, so goddamn depressing.

04:53.369 --> 04:54.815
Who's this?

04:54.859 --> 04:57.243
This is your new
assistant Isaiah Miller.

04:57.243 --> 04:59.662
It is such an extreme honor
to meet you, sir.

04:59.663 --> 05:03.662
Maggie, I do not need
any more assistants.

05:03.663 --> 05:06.395
I can wipe my own ass.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.830
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

05:12.496 --> 05:13.995
Wipe his ass? Does he really need...

05:13.996 --> 05:15.788
- Figure of speech.
- Right, of course.

05:15.789 --> 05:17.787
- Speech, right.
- I think.

05:17.788 --> 05:23.662
(Graves urinating, moaning)

05:24.516 --> 05:27.287
- That's an intimidating stream.
- Like a horse.

05:27.288 --> 05:29.687
Sweetheart, there's no way
you can survive your schedule

05:29.712 --> 05:32.244
without an assistant.
Your week is packed.

05:32.988 --> 05:34.995
And Isaiah has your itinerary.

05:34.996 --> 05:37.051
Yeah, yeah.

05:39.413 --> 05:41.767
- What's next?
- You fly to Texas today...

05:41.768 --> 05:44.474
Children's Health Initiative
sponsored by the White House.

05:44.475 --> 05:46.495
Just a fun day with some kids.

05:46.496 --> 05:48.162
Mags, that sounds like torture.

05:48.163 --> 05:50.162
And don't forget, we have
New York in two days...

05:50.163 --> 05:51.745
your Cancer Society keynote.

05:51.746 --> 05:53.955
Lawrence is gonna fly out
and help you with your speech.

05:53.956 --> 05:56.995
I'm like some old relic in storage

05:56.996 --> 06:00.620
that you wheel out once a
year, year after year.

06:00.621 --> 06:03.037
- Oh, Maggie.
- What, angel?

06:03.038 --> 06:06.162
- Will it ever end?
- Yes, it will, dear.

06:06.163 --> 06:09.436
But for now, I need you
to be nice to Isaiah.

06:10.121 --> 06:11.554
Who?

06:11.654 --> 06:13.501
Isaiah.

06:13.828 --> 06:15.084
Hi.

06:18.913 --> 06:21.912
(Woman singing in Spanish)

06:21.913 --> 06:24.454
How are you, President Graves?

06:24.455 --> 06:26.995
Pain, Ramona. Nothing but pain.

06:26.996 --> 06:28.467
That's good.

06:28.871 --> 06:31.434
I'll be gone for one day
to a book signing in Denver.

06:31.435 --> 06:32.892
- Yes, ma'am.
- I want you to...

06:32.893 --> 06:35.892
Mrs. Graves, you need
to see this before we go.

06:35.893 --> 06:39.059
As we reported earlier,
news of former first daughter

06:39.060 --> 06:41.205
Olivia Graves' marriage dissolution

06:41.206 --> 06:44.662
has been confirmed
by senior GOP leadership staff,

06:44.663 --> 06:47.120
where her husband serves
as a second-term congressman.

06:47.121 --> 06:50.371
The daughter of transformational
former President Richard Graves

06:50.372 --> 06:52.662
and iconic First Lady Margaret,

06:52.663 --> 06:55.537
Olivia is American political royalty.

06:55.538 --> 06:59.287
Get me Jacob. Then Olivia.

Wolf Blitzer: <i>Little Livy,
as she was known...</i>

07:01.185 --> 07:03.351

07:03.352 --> 07:07.329
is a long way from the fairy tale
White House she grew up in.

07:07.330 --> 07:09.995
I'm fine, Mother.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.684
Really, I'm just ridiculously fantastic.

07:12.685 --> 07:14.162
Margaret: <i>Oh, that tone.</i>

07:14.163 --> 07:16.934
What are you doing right now,
right this second?

07:17.352 --> 07:19.060
Right now I just finished
blowtorching the hell

07:19.060 --> 07:21.038
out of William's Queen Anne table,

07:21.039 --> 07:23.329
the one the Smithsonian wanted,

07:23.781 --> 07:25.329
among other things.

07:25.330 --> 07:28.412
Do me a favor
and leave me the hell alone.

07:28.413 --> 07:30.495
Don't be here for me.

07:30.496 --> 07:32.944
Don't understand.

07:32.969 --> 07:36.287
Livy, this is a trigger.
Don't you purge.

07:36.288 --> 07:40.162
I was bulimic for, like,
a day when I was 15, Mother.

07:40.163 --> 07:43.870
Literally one fucking day!

07:43.871 --> 07:47.245
Okay, you do not handle stress well,
honey. You need to come home.

07:47.246 --> 07:48.786
Olivia: <i>Oh, my God.</i>

07:48.787 --> 07:52.829
(sobbing) I loved him so much.

07:52.830 --> 07:54.299
Oh.

07:54.705 --> 07:56.955
- Man: <i>Olivia?
- (knock on door)</i>

08:00.084 --> 08:01.995
You sent Uncle Jacob?

08:02.416 --> 08:04.870
I don't need your fucking fixer!

08:04.871 --> 08:07.162
You listen to Uncle Jacob.

08:08.183 --> 08:11.163
Livy, put the blowtorch down, honey.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.912
Sweetheart, give me the blowtorch.

08:33.996 --> 08:36.955

before you fly to Texas.

08:36.956 --> 08:38.995
He needs to see people.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.828
He needs a dose of adoration.

08:40.830 --> 08:43.455
It's the only thing that's gonna shake
him out of this pissy mood he's in.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.245

- She retired last week.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.495
- What, already?
- She was 87.

09:26.496 --> 09:27.912
Oh. Oh.

09:27.913 --> 09:30.413
- Coffee?

09:41.746 --> 09:43.267
President Graves' assistant.

09:43.268 --> 09:44.662
First time saying that.

09:44.663 --> 09:48.120
President? Oh, shit, that's right.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.995
I knew I recognized you
from somewhere, man,

09:49.996 --> 09:54.495
but, honestly, I kind of
thought you were dead.

09:54.883 --> 09:57.580
Is that Latin?

09:57.580 --> 09:58.662
Oh, yeah.

09:58.663 --> 10:01.870
Amor Vincit Omnia?

10:01.871 --> 10:04.579
Love conquers all things.

10:04.580 --> 10:05.922
Right.

10:06.330 --> 10:07.995
Bit simplistic.

10:07.996 --> 10:09.870
Well, I'm a fan of simple.

10:09.871 --> 10:11.699
Oh? All right.

10:12.147 --> 10:14.581
Well, I will be right back to
take your order, Mr. President.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.203
Thank you.

10:17.748 --> 10:20.330
What the hell are you staring at?

10:28.580 --> 10:30.162
You got any Latino in you?

10:30.863 --> 10:32.370
Actually, I do, in fact, yes.

10:32.371 --> 10:36.995
Mayan? Where's your family from?
Chiapas? Yucatán?

10:36.996 --> 10:39.537
Uh, no, my... well, my dad...

10:39.538 --> 10:41.892
Yucatec Maya's a beautiful language.

10:41.893 --> 10:44.413
- Oh.
- I've heard it spoken only once.

10:44.414 --> 10:48.995
I was on a diplomatic summit with
President Portillo of Mexico,

10:48.996 --> 10:52.912
and I was sitting on top of a pyramid

10:52.913 --> 10:55.245
in the middle of a jungle.

10:56.219 --> 10:59.496
Actually, I'm half Spanish,
half German Jew, sir.

10:59.967 --> 11:03.509
From St. Louis, originally,
but then my mom moved us to Phoenix

11:03.510 --> 11:05.929
when I was four, a state
which you carried two times.

11:05.954 --> 11:08.269
Obviously, you know that, though.

11:08.694 --> 11:12.287
Anyone ever tell you what
a goddamn buzzkill you are?

11:12.542 --> 11:14.870
Uh, yeah.

11:18.910 --> 11:21.245
Don't stop, keep it up. You got this.

11:21.246 --> 11:22.829
Nobody quits today.

11:22.830 --> 11:24.829
Nobody's giving up on me.

11:24.830 --> 11:26.370
Nobody's gonna stop.

11:26.371 --> 11:29.120
- She's the devil.
- <i>Stick with it.</i>

11:29.121 --> 11:30.495
How does it feel, Mr. President?

11:30.496 --> 11:34.829
- Feels good, right?
- A life lived healthy

11:34.830 --> 11:37.704

Afternoon, Freddie.
I'll just be a few minutes.

16:04.621 --> 16:07.829
Well, the museum is closed on Mondays,
so it's all yours.

16:07.830 --> 16:10.330
- Good.
- Thank you.

16:30.602 --> 16:32.315
Your son Jeremy.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.017
- He's in Kabul, isn't he?
- Yeah.

16:34.018 --> 16:35.301
You know, when I was a kid,

16:35.302 --> 16:38.352
Jeremy's national Scout
campaign really inspired me.

16:38.353 --> 16:40.329
I actually joined because of him.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.301
Got over 100 merit badges.

16:42.788 --> 16:46.302
124, to be exact. Sir?

16:49.725 --> 16:51.918

You saved a lot of lives, sir, in Libya.

17:52.621 --> 17:54.495

17:54.496 --> 17:58.591
I argued your preemptive action
was the only humane choice.

22:55.102 --> 22:58.434
Literally, the most consequential
person I could possibly lose.

22:58.435 --> 23:00.829

23:19.330 --> 23:20.858

and then there was this
whole thing with the...

Okay, okay. It's okay. What is this?

23:24.996 --> 23:27.329

- I used to work here.

new assistant, Isaiah.

23:40.163 --> 23:41.287

of antique furniture.

23:48.371 --> 23:50.579
- And?
- It's taken care of.

23:50.580 --> 23:52.287
- The Rockefellers...
- Can burn in hell.

23:52.288 --> 23:55.684
...are cooperating. They
want a clean, quiet divorce.

Oh, honey, no. Never say that.

24:20.289 --> 24:21.569
Have to go now, Maggie.

24:21.570 --> 24:24.246
It seems Big Bird
found his way to his library

24:24.247 --> 24:25.668
and did some redecorating.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.556
Oh, my God.

24:28.246 --> 24:29.871
Richard would never do this,

24:30.269 --> 24:32.370
not in a million years.

24:32.371 --> 24:34.788
Ma'am, they've found the president.

24:45.871 --> 24:49.038
(Graves coughing)

24:54.496 --> 24:57.038
That feels so good, right?

24:58.918 --> 25:00.210
Right?

25:00.996 --> 25:04.386
How'd I get this goddamn old

25:05.496 --> 25:07.955
and never really felt like this?

25:11.496 --> 25:12.996
It's never too late.

25:19.330 --> 25:21.662
Margaret: <i>Richard!</i>

25:21.663 --> 25:23.705
Richard!

25:26.663 --> 25:28.412
Good morning, sweetheart!

25:28.706 --> 25:30.829
Are you totally insane?

25:30.830 --> 25:33.829
No, no, dear, to the contrary.

25:33.830 --> 25:36.620
What are you doing? Get down here.

25:36.621 --> 25:39.662
Hey, look. Look at me.

25:39.663 --> 25:43.120
I'm free. I'm free from my old skin!

25:43.121 --> 25:45.995
Can you imagine
if anyone saw you like this?

25:45.996 --> 25:49.037
Oh, no, Maggie,
I'm through with imagining.

25:49.038 --> 25:50.620
I'm living now.

25:51.002 --> 25:52.954
It's never too late.

25:52.955 --> 25:55.787
I just crash-landed
in the middle of my life.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.662
Richard, enough.

25:57.663 --> 25:59.746
- Stop.
- <i>I'm born again, sweetheart,</i>

25:59.747 --> 26:02.495
and it's total peace.

26:02.907 --> 26:08.204
Which is the only thing I
really ever need anymore, Mags,

26:08.205 --> 26:12.287
is just a little motherfucking peace!

26:13.611 --> 26:15.244
Shit.

26:22.746 --> 26:24.203
You're angry.

26:25.121 --> 26:26.659
I'm confused,

26:27.580 --> 26:29.121
and not just about last night.

26:29.122 --> 26:31.620
What you did with your library...

26:31.621 --> 26:33.269
what were you thinking?

26:33.580 --> 26:36.454
Well, I wasn't thinking, Mags.

26:36.455 --> 26:37.913
For the first time in my life,

26:37.914 --> 26:39.912
I was just doing.

26:39.913 --> 26:42.288
Yeah, well, you scared
the hell out of me.

26:42.289 --> 26:45.175
You don't get to just
disappear like that.

26:45.746 --> 26:47.412
And then to find you...

26:47.413 --> 26:51.455
Oh, I'm sorry, Mags.
I'm really, really sorry.

26:57.205 --> 26:59.912
Anyway, the speech that you're giving

26:59.913 --> 27:02.038
this morning is very important.

27:02.039 --> 27:03.413
Mmm.

27:06.663 --> 27:08.205
What speech?

27:11.455 --> 27:13.538
Woman: <i>It's an honor to be here today</i>

27:13.539 --> 27:17.662
among so many survivors
in the fight against cancer.

27:17.663 --> 27:21.537
Now, all through my career,
I have devoted myself...

27:21.538 --> 27:23.170
Sorry, sorry.

27:23.171 --> 27:24.829
Mags, it's too tight.

27:24.830 --> 27:26.995
Oh, you big baby.

27:26.996 --> 27:30.246
Even though I didn't always
agree with his policies,

27:30.247 --> 27:33.162
Richard Graves is the very model

27:33.163 --> 27:36.162
of what a former president should be...

27:36.163 --> 27:37.752
a statesman.

27:37.915 --> 27:39.955
Oh, Jesus, I need a cigarette.

27:39.955 --> 27:41.829
Right before your kid's cancer speech?

27:41.830 --> 27:44.162
- Are you high?
- Yes.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.620
(Gasps)

27:45.621 --> 27:47.538
President Richard Graves.

27:59.288 --> 28:01.121
Mr. President.

28:17.371 --> 28:20.037
Thank you for that gracious welcome.

28:20.528 --> 28:24.705
Let me start by saying that when I look

28:24.705 --> 28:27.280
into these children's faces,

28:27.830 --> 28:30.829
I can feel their hurt and their pain

28:30.830 --> 28:32.991
now more than ever.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.600
(Sighs)

28:37.871 --> 28:39.621
Excuse me.

28:46.038 --> 28:48.829
I can only imagine the difficult

28:49.365 --> 28:52.495
and brave journey they've endured.

28:53.049 --> 28:54.602
The truth...

28:56.704 --> 28:58.956
the truth is that...

29:04.955 --> 29:06.704
Truth...

29:07.413 --> 29:08.792
uh...

29:10.080 --> 29:11.455
(no audible dialogue)

29:16.496 --> 29:17.929
I mean...

29:26.788 --> 29:27.961
The truth.

29:30.663 --> 29:32.089
The truth is,

29:32.746 --> 29:36.037
until we start forgiving ourselves

29:36.038 --> 29:39.079
for every bad decision we've ever made,

29:39.080 --> 29:41.995
we will be defined by our past

29:41.996 --> 29:44.454
and nothing will ever get done.

29:44.455 --> 29:45.829
What is he doing?

29:45.830 --> 29:47.037
That son of a...

29:47.038 --> 29:51.120
Look, this cancer thing, this disease,

29:51.121 --> 29:52.620
it's impossible.

29:52.621 --> 29:56.621
It's a moving target.
It evolves. It changes.

30:00.663 --> 30:03.639
But here's what I can tell you.

30:04.955 --> 30:09.954
It's all math, and they're scared of it.

30:10.136 --> 30:12.663
Your government is, your president is,

30:12.663 --> 30:14.162
your Congress is.

30:14.163 --> 30:17.121
Hell, I was. Scared shitless.

30:19.205 --> 30:20.455
I mean, let's face it.

30:20.456 --> 30:22.870
It was me who gutted

30:22.871 --> 30:26.080
the federal grants for cancer research.

30:26.913 --> 30:28.287
I did this.

30:28.657 --> 30:30.768
This has nothing to do
with what I wrote.

30:30.768 --> 30:32.329
I don't know how many people died

30:32.330 --> 30:35.245
because my political machine
at that time

30:35.246 --> 30:38.954
just figured,
"Hell, dying people don't vote."

30:38.955 --> 30:40.454
(crowd gasps)

30:41.017 --> 30:44.371
That's the dirty Washington calculus.

30:47.496 --> 30:49.080
Now, you want the truth?

30:50.788 --> 30:52.454
All right, your government spends

30:52.455 --> 30:56.368
about 4.5 billion on cancer research.

30:57.450 --> 31:00.412
Ladies and gentlemen, that is bullshit.

31:00.413 --> 31:03.120
That is just walking-around money.

31:03.121 --> 31:04.495
How about they take

31:04.496 --> 31:07.829
that $81 billion they plan on spending

31:07.830 --> 31:10.995
on new military aircraft next year

31:10.996 --> 31:14.704
and move it down to cancer research?

31:15.074 --> 31:19.330
You do that, and I guarantee you,
I promise you,

31:19.330 --> 31:21.995
we would have a cure for this disease

31:21.996 --> 31:23.829
within a decade.

31:23.830 --> 31:26.927
And I will help you get there,

31:28.411 --> 31:31.702
because I'm awake now.

31:31.830 --> 31:34.288
I'm wide awake.

31:35.996 --> 31:39.745
And I promise you, until the day I die,

31:39.746 --> 31:42.829
I will be your biggest advocate,

31:42.830 --> 31:44.620
your beacon of hope,

31:44.621 --> 31:46.996
your goddamn president!

32:03.913 --> 32:05.413
(No audible dialogue)

32:18.246 --> 32:20.788
You are such a brave little girl.

32:29.788 --> 32:32.079
"Black men enter here."

32:32.080 --> 32:34.205
- Oh, my God.
- He's a monster.

32:34.206 --> 32:37.163
God bless you.
