00:15.067 --> 00:17.627
Do you think Maris and I
are meant to be together?

00:27.667 --> 00:30.227
MARTIN: Oh, what's this?
- I got you a gift.

00:30.427 --> 00:32.941
- You did? What's the occasion?
- No reason.

00:33.347 --> 00:34.985
You can't give something
for no reason.

00:35.187 --> 00:36.302
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

00:36.507 --> 00:37.622
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

00:37.827 --> 00:39.545
You're starting
to take the fun out of this.

00:39.987 --> 00:41.500
But there's no reason for this.

00:41.707 --> 00:43.345
- Does there have to be a reason?
- Yeah.

00:43.547 --> 00:47.586
- Oh, would you just open it?
- Oh, jeez.

00:47.787 --> 00:50.301
- I knitted it myself.
- Oh, gee...

00:50.507 --> 00:52.304
You know, I had trouble
with the rolled collar.

00:52.507 --> 00:54.975
I'm surprised you didn't hear me
cursing from my bedroom.

00:55.187 --> 00:58.816
Boy, Daphne, this is really nice.
I wish I had something to give you.

00:59.027 --> 01:00.983
- We're back on that again.
- All right, all right.

01:01.187 --> 01:04.099
- But at least let me pay you for it.
- Pay me for it? It's a gift.

01:04.307 --> 01:06.741
Just a couple bucks for the yarn.

01:08.187 --> 01:09.461
- Dad, has Niles called?
- No.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.658
I've been standing out front
for 20 minutes.

01:11.867 --> 01:14.301
We're gonna be late
for our squash court.

01:14.627 --> 01:17.346
- Nice cardigan.
- Daphne surprised me with it.

01:17.547 --> 01:18.946
You don't seem very happy about it.

01:19.147 --> 01:21.263
I'm not. I mean, you just
don't give somebody something

01:21.467 --> 01:24.459
- for no reason. That's my rule.
- Dad, spontaneous gift-giving

01:24.667 --> 01:26.146
is one of life's great pleasures.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.099
Didn't you give Mom anything
without warning?

01:28.307 --> 01:29.422
Yeah, you.

01:30.987 --> 01:32.579
Where do you think
I got the rule from?

01:32.827 --> 01:34.055
[BELL DINGS]

01:34.227 --> 01:36.297
Oh, there you are. Come on,
Niles, let's shake a leg.

01:36.507 --> 01:38.577
- We'll be late for our court time.
- Just a minute.

01:38.787 --> 01:42.621
Of course I do, Maris.
Well, I miss you more.

01:42.827 --> 01:46.183
- No, I do. No, I do.
- Niles.

01:46.827 --> 01:50.024
More than Van Cleef
would miss Arpels.

01:50.507 --> 01:51.701
Oh, no, I don't.

01:51.867 --> 01:53.823
No, you have the prettier laugh.

01:54.027 --> 01:56.461
No, you do. No, you do.

01:56.667 --> 01:59.181
MARTIN:
I'm gonna go walk into the ocean.

02:00.547 --> 02:03.425
Oh, no, I would love to meet you
for lunch, but you know

02:03.627 --> 02:06.346
what Dr Deutsch said: No meetings
outside our therapy sessions.

02:06.547 --> 02:10.664
Oh, now, Maris... Oh, wait, hold on
a second. It's my other line. Hello.

02:10.866 --> 02:12.220
Get the hell off the phone.

02:18.107 --> 02:19.301
How rude.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.423
Please. You realize
it's also rude to be late?

02:21.587 --> 02:23.657
You're telling me about being late
for an appointment?

02:23.827 --> 02:25.738
FRASIER:
You're ridiculously tardy. Tardy, tardy.

02:25.907 --> 02:27.420
NILES: No, I think...
FRASIER: Forget it.

02:27.627 --> 02:30.221
How dare you hang up on me.

02:32.947 --> 02:34.505
Bunny?

02:35.307 --> 02:37.263
Do you mind if we
continue this conversation later?

02:37.427 --> 02:40.419
Oh, I'll be counting the minutes too.

02:40.787 --> 02:43.460
Well, I hope you're happy.
We have now officially lost our court.

02:43.667 --> 02:46.465
Well, I'm sorry. I would hope that
my attempt to salvage my marriage

02:46.667 --> 02:48.305
would be more important
than a squash game.

02:48.507 --> 02:50.577
Of course. I was just
looking forward to playing.

02:50.787 --> 02:52.857
I enjoy a morning game of squash
more than anyone.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.500
- No, I do.
- No, I do.

02:54.707 --> 02:56.379
No, no, stop it.

02:57.227 --> 02:59.695
Niles, I would love to see
you and Maris reconcile,

02:59.867 --> 03:02.904
if that's what you want. I'm just afraid
you might be going a bit too quickly.

03:03.067 --> 03:04.546
- Would you like some coffee?
- Please.

03:04.747 --> 03:07.261
Need I remind you last month
she served you with divorce papers?

03:07.467 --> 03:09.423
I'm aware of that.
We're not rushing into anything.

03:09.587 --> 03:11.464
We only see each other at therapy.

03:11.667 --> 03:14.579
That reminds me. Yesterday
at the cafë, I asked you a question,

03:14.787 --> 03:16.425
which you deftly avoided answering.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.942
Do you think Maris and I
are meant to be together?

03:19.307 --> 03:21.218
Right. Well...

03:21.547 --> 03:23.538
That's a tough question.

03:24.147 --> 03:25.626
Perhaps the better question
would be,

03:25.787 --> 03:28.017
"Do you think you and Maris
are meant to be together?"

03:28.227 --> 03:30.661
I serve you up a question.
You clumsily bat it back to me.

03:30.867 --> 03:33.301
We've hardly missed
our squash game at all.

03:34.907 --> 03:37.341
No, no, I'm really interested
in your opinion.

03:37.547 --> 03:41.381
- Let's say you were God.
- Niles, please, I don't wanna play God.

03:42.227 --> 03:44.695
Please. No, just play along.

03:46.187 --> 03:49.065
Let's say you are the supreme
ruler of heaven and earth.

03:49.267 --> 03:50.985
- What would you do?
- Well, for starters,

03:51.187 --> 03:53.417
I'd issue a recall on some
of my lesser species.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

03:57.547 --> 03:58.616
L...

03:58.787 --> 04:02.257
I still want an answer
to that question. Hello?

04:02.467 --> 04:05.777
What is it, pumpkin?
Oh, now, now... Dear, calm down.

04:05.987 --> 04:08.421
I'm sure that the banging
you hear is just the pipes.

04:08.627 --> 04:10.822
If a servant had been
walled in during the remodelling,

04:11.027 --> 04:12.904
he'd have died weeks ago.

04:14.147 --> 04:17.696
If it will ease your mind at all, why
don't you have Marta take roll call?

04:17.906 --> 04:20.899
- Hold on a second. Hello?
- Get out.

04:27.627 --> 04:32.143
Well, this is Dr Frasier Crane, saying
goodbye and good mental health.

04:33.747 --> 04:35.021
Your brother called.

04:35.227 --> 04:37.377
Lord, he must really want
an answer to that question.

04:37.587 --> 04:39.976
No, he wanted to tell you
the wine-club meeting was cancelled.

04:40.187 --> 04:42.382
- What question?
- Yesterday, he asked me straight out

04:42.587 --> 04:44.578
if I thought he and Maris
were meant for each other.

04:44.787 --> 04:47.426
- That's a loaded question.
- Yeah, you're telling me.

04:47.627 --> 04:49.060
I don't even know
what my answer is.

04:49.427 --> 04:51.497
Why don't you just play it safe
and say yes?

04:51.707 --> 04:53.618
In my experience, when someone
asks that question,

04:53.827 --> 04:56.387
they're not looking for honesty,
they're looking for reassurance.

04:56.587 --> 04:59.101
- Tell him what he wants to hear.
- I don't know, Roz.

04:59.307 --> 05:03.220
Trust me, Frasier. It's like if I ask you,
"Do I look fat in these pants?"

05:03.427 --> 05:05.702
You're right. There's only one way
to answer that question.

05:05.907 --> 05:07.465
What?

05:07.987 --> 05:09.898
- Do you think I look fat in these?
- No, I don't.

05:10.067 --> 05:13.423
- I work out. It's the pleats, isn't it?
- Just stop it. Get ahold of yourself.

05:13.627 --> 05:16.505
I was thinking about what you
had said. I'm gonna tell Niles yes,

05:16.707 --> 05:19.380
I think he and Maris
were meant to be together.

05:20.067 --> 05:23.059
Who are you waving to? Is that
Elise Edmonds from Promotions?

05:23.267 --> 05:25.827
- We got a little date tonight.
- A date? And you didn't tell me?

05:26.027 --> 05:27.938
It's no big deal.
I don't think she's interested.

05:28.107 --> 05:29.460
- Hi, Frasier. Hey, Roz.
FRASIER Hi.

05:29.627 --> 05:31.583
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I just wanted to make sure.

05:31.747 --> 05:33.578
- Am I still seeing you tonight?
- Yes, you are.

05:33.787 --> 05:36.381
Which means, of course,
that I'll be seeing you as well.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.306
Great. Bye.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.986
Whoa!

05:42.227 --> 05:44.218
That woman is totally into you.

- You think so?
- Yeah. "I'll see you later. Great. Bye."

05:50.307 --> 05:51.660
- And that's a good sign?
- Hello.

05:51.867 --> 05:54.745
She might as well have calf-roped
you with her pantyhose.

05:54.947 --> 05:56.858
This promises to be
a very interesting evening.

05:57.027 --> 05:59.939
- I think so.
- Well, she is very attractive. Slender.

06:00.147 --> 06:01.739
Gee, I wonder why
your mind went there.

06:01.947 --> 06:04.063
- Not this again, Roz.
- Of course. She was next to me.

06:04.227 --> 06:05.296
I hate these pants.

- I look like the Liberty Bell.
- The Liberty Bell...

- Afternoon, Mr Crane.
- Hello.

06:21.267 --> 06:23.701
- I've got the mail.
- Oh, thanks.

06:23.907 --> 06:26.705
You wanna just
put it on the table there?

06:27.347 --> 06:28.336
Is this for me?

06:28.547 --> 06:32.460
You know anybody else around here
who uses eucalyptus bubble bath?

06:32.867 --> 06:36.223
- Well, your son occasionally likes...
- Oh, never mind.

06:36.747 --> 06:39.102
- This is lovely.
- Well, I'm glad you like it,

06:39.307 --> 06:40.899
because I picked it all out myself.

06:41.107 --> 06:44.702
You know, I got you your fancy
soaps, and your moisturizers,

06:44.867 --> 06:49.338
and this rock thing that scrapes all the
dead skin off the bottom of your feet.

06:50.387 --> 06:53.743
Well, if you're gonna nap
on the couch, wear slippers.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.666
- Still, Mr Crane, you really overdid it.
- No, I didn't.

06:56.867 --> 06:59.176
- I don't know if I can accept this.
- Why not?

06:59.387 --> 07:01.139
Because you spent far too much.

07:01.347 --> 07:03.986
All right. Well, then, I'll take
a couple of things back.

07:04.187 --> 07:05.666
Wait, not that one.

07:05.867 --> 07:08.540
Daphne, would you please
just take the damn basket?

07:08.747 --> 07:10.339
What are you getting
so cross about?

07:10.547 --> 07:13.380
You can give me a gift, but I'm
not allowed to give you one back?

07:13.587 --> 07:16.420
- That's the reason you gave me this?
- Yeah, that's the way it works.

07:16.627 --> 07:18.458
Where I come from,
you don't give someone a gift

07:18.667 --> 07:21.056
because you have to.
Here, take your silly basket.

07:21.267 --> 07:24.942
All right, fine. Well, then, you can take
your crappy old cardigan back too.

07:25.147 --> 07:27.058
I don't know why you gave it
to me in the first place.

07:27.227 --> 07:28.865
- Because I like you.
- Well, I like you.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.058
Than why can't you just accept
my gift and be happy?

07:31.267 --> 07:34.259
- I am happy. I love that cardigan.
- And I love my damn basket.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.776
- What is all this?
- We're exchanging our damn gifts.

07:36.987 --> 07:38.739

Well, here.

07:38.947 --> 07:39.936
- Here.
- Thanks.

07:40.147 --> 07:41.739
Thank you.

07:42.947 --> 07:44.096
Good Lord.

07:44.307 --> 07:47.504
It's like Christmas morning
in the Gambino household.

07:52.707 --> 07:55.301
By the way, Niles called while you
were in the shower to remind you

07:55.507 --> 07:56.656
about the squash tomorrow.

07:57.267 --> 07:59.781
That's strange. We just made that
date this morning. He must be

07:59.947 --> 08:02.017
champing at the bit to get
an answer to that question.

08:02.227 --> 08:03.262
What question?

08:03.467 --> 08:07.016
Oh, he asked me if I thought he
and Maris were meant to be together.

08:07.227 --> 08:09.616
Well, if you ask me,
you should keep your bazoo shut.

08:09.827 --> 08:12.739
You're always getting in trouble
opening that big bazoo of yours.

08:12.947 --> 08:15.825
How wonderful, Dad. We found a new
word to strike from your vocabulary,

08:16.027 --> 08:19.144
along with patootie and bupkis.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.700
You're gonna answer him, aren't you?

08:22.227 --> 08:24.536
I think I have to. But listen,
I'm just gonna play it safe.

08:24.747 --> 08:26.738
Tell him yes. He's gonna do
what he wants to anyway.

08:26.947 --> 08:29.097
I don't know. He takes
your opinion pretty seriously.

08:29.307 --> 08:31.537
Well, when we were younger,
there was a certain sway

08:31.707 --> 08:32.856
I had over him, but...

08:33.067 --> 08:35.626
Do you remember back in prep
school when he was gonna try out

08:35.827 --> 08:37.897
for the track team?
I convinced him all the cool kids

08:38.107 --> 08:40.177
were gonna join the Madrigal Society?

08:41.307 --> 08:43.537
I'm not just talking about school.
He's always come to you

08:43.746 --> 08:46.022
for career decisions too.
Where to do his residency,

08:46.227 --> 08:47.660
where to set up his practice.

08:48.627 --> 08:51.095
Perhaps I have
underestimated my influence.

08:51.307 --> 08:52.979
You know, frankly,
my opinion could be

08:53.187 --> 08:55.576
the single most important factor
in his making this decision.

08:55.787 --> 08:57.937
- I don't know if I'd go as far as that.
- Please, Dad.

08:58.147 --> 09:00.741
You don't know what it's like
to have your opinion matter.

09:03.307 --> 09:06.697
Niles depends on me. He deserves
my true and honest answer.

09:06.867 --> 09:08.823
- And what is that?
- Well...

09:09.467 --> 09:11.059
Maris has always been
spoiled and selfish

09:11.267 --> 09:13.064
and led him around by the nose.

09:13.467 --> 09:15.105
I'd have to say my answer
would be no.

09:16.067 --> 09:18.979
Thank you, Dad. I've changed
my answer from a yes to a no.

09:19.187 --> 09:20.586
MARTIN:
There you go.

09:20.787 --> 09:23.255
FRASIER: On the other hand...
MARTIN: I knew it.

09:24.347 --> 09:26.986
Well, no, you know, there are
a lot of other factors here, Dad.

09:27.827 --> 09:30.295
Niles does love Maris.

09:31.107 --> 09:34.656
She has agreed to go into therapy,
and Niles swears

09:34.867 --> 09:36.903
that she's a changed person. L...

09:37.107 --> 09:39.575
I don't know. I guess if I really
wanna know what's going on

09:39.787 --> 09:41.937
in Maris' mind,
I've got to ask her myself.

09:42.507 --> 09:45.783
- You agree with that, don't you, Dad?
MARTIN: Oh, yeah, sure.

09:47.067 --> 09:49.262
FRASIER: Well, I've got
a couple hours before my date.

09:49.467 --> 09:51.503
So if I really wanna know
what Maris is thinking,

09:51.707 --> 09:53.982
I will go directly to the source.

09:55.427 --> 09:57.577
- Are you ready to order?
- Well, not quite yet.

09:57.787 --> 10:01.143
I'm still waiting on someone.
Oh, there she is now.

10:04.427 --> 10:06.304
Marta.

10:09.947 --> 10:12.097
Marta, I can't tell you how nice
it is to see you again.

10:12.307 --> 10:17.301
My pleasure. And this coffee
is too, too divine.

10:17.907 --> 10:20.341
I see your English lessons
with Maris are progressing nicely.

10:20.547 --> 10:22.219
Yes. She teaching me many words.

10:22.627 --> 10:26.097
That coat is so dëclassë.

10:27.507 --> 10:30.499
Listen, Marta, I'm gonna come
right to my point.

10:31.227 --> 10:34.936
Dr Crane and Maris... Missy Crane.

10:35.467 --> 10:38.220
- Have been seeing
a couples' therapist lately,

10:38.427 --> 10:42.261
- and I understand it's going very well.
- Therapy helping Missy Crane a lot.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.186
Really? So you would say
that she's a changed person?

10:45.387 --> 10:49.619
<i>Si, si. Missy Crane very different,
nicer to everyone.</i>

10:49.827 --> 10:52.057
And this time no happy pills.

10:54.507 --> 10:58.182
For my birthday, she gave me
beautiful Chanel makeup bag.

10:58.387 --> 11:01.060
It's a knockoff, but it's big.

11:02.107 --> 11:05.179
Oh, all right then,
this is my question:

11:05.547 --> 11:08.823
If Dr Crane and Mrs Crane
were to get back together again,

11:09.027 --> 11:10.460
do you?

11:11.027 --> 11:15.737
Do you think that Mrs Crane
would treat Dr Crane better?

11:15.947 --> 11:19.781
Oh, yes. Please ask
Dr Crane to come home.

11:19.987 --> 11:23.582
Marta, you've been most helpful.
You know, lately, I've been wondering

11:23.787 --> 11:25.539
if Niles and Maris ought
to be together.

11:25.747 --> 11:28.739
And now, thanks to you, I know that
the answer to that question is yes.

11:28.907 --> 11:29.896
[MARTA LAUGHS]

11:30.067 --> 11:31.136
What?
Did I say something funny?

11:31.347 --> 11:34.657
No, my beeper on vibrate.
It tickle me.

11:36.107 --> 11:38.337
Sorry. I have to go.
Missy Crane need me.

11:38.507 --> 11:41.943
<i>- Oh, thanks, all right. I understand.
- Thanks for cafe.</i>

11:42.107 --> 11:44.223
Call me. Mean it.

11:45.027 --> 11:47.257
Well, there is a limit.

11:48.067 --> 11:49.420
- Hey.
- Oh, Daphne.

11:49.627 --> 11:51.538
Was that Mrs Crane's Marta
who was just leaving?

11:51.747 --> 11:53.738
It was.
We were just sharing a coffee.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.745
Marta helped allay my fears about
Niles and Maris getting back together.

11:56.947 --> 11:59.859
Yes, I think she'd be glad to see
Dr Crane back in that household.

12:00.547 --> 12:02.936
- I should go get my beans.
- Wait, Daphne. What do you mean?

12:03.147 --> 12:05.183
Well, I'm sure Dr Crane
acts as a good buffer

12:05.387 --> 12:06.900
between Mrs Crane and the help.

12:07.547 --> 12:10.300
Gee, it never occurred to me that
Marta might have an ulterior motive.

12:10.507 --> 12:13.067
Who could blame her?
Mrs Crane can be a bit demanding.

12:13.267 --> 12:16.384
Well, then, this taints
Marta's entire testimony.

12:16.587 --> 12:19.021
Is it possible
she could have lied to me?

12:19.227 --> 12:22.663
No. With my trained eye, very
few things can escape my notice,

12:22.827 --> 12:25.022
as I'm sure
you've observed, Daphne.

12:25.947 --> 12:28.461
You think that l...?
But could she have lied to me?

12:28.667 --> 12:30.464
You know, see,
this is the predicament I'm in.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.135
Every time someone gives me
a valid argument, somebody else

12:33.347 --> 12:35.941
comes along, gives me
a perfectly valid counterargument.

12:36.147 --> 12:39.662
One minute I think the answer is yes,
the next minute I think it's no.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.700
This is driving me crazy.
No, I've got to stick with it.

12:43.907 --> 12:47.377
Niles asked me what I think...
That's it. What I think.

12:47.587 --> 12:48.940
I don't know
what I think right now.

12:49.147 --> 12:51.058
But that's where I should focus.
Don't you agree?

12:51.267 --> 12:53.940
Oh, yes, absolutely.

12:59.867 --> 13:03.018
ELISE: Oh, I'm so glad
we're finally doing this.

13:03.907 --> 13:07.104
- Oh, yeah, me too.
- Is everything all right, Frasier?

13:07.307 --> 13:11.300
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
I'm just a little preoccupied.

13:12.027 --> 13:13.745
Stop obsessing.

13:13.947 --> 13:15.938
Enjoy the date.

13:21.587 --> 13:23.179
Here we are.

13:24.307 --> 13:25.456
So where are we going?

13:25.667 --> 13:28.340
I've chosen a little Italian place
I know, if that's all right.

13:28.547 --> 13:29.821
- I trust your judgement.
- Okay.

13:30.027 --> 13:31.346
But then, who doesn't?

13:36.467 --> 13:37.741
Are you okay?

13:38.507 --> 13:40.896
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.503
I told myself I wasn't gonna
bring this up to you.

13:43.707 --> 13:45.937
I don't really think
it's appropriate for a first date,

13:46.147 --> 13:50.060
but I haven't been able to think about
anything else all day, so here goes.

13:51.307 --> 13:53.457
Do you think it's possible

13:53.667 --> 13:58.104
for two people
to be meant for each other?

13:59.747 --> 14:03.660
- You've thought about that all day?
- Yes.

14:03.867 --> 14:06.427
- Well, yes, I do.
- I do too.

14:06.627 --> 14:10.540
But how do you know that they're
meant for each other?

14:10.747 --> 14:13.705
Of course, it's essential that they have
similar interests, goals in common.

14:13.907 --> 14:17.058
- Don't forget physical attraction.
- Oh, well, that's a given. Yeah.

14:18.347 --> 14:20.577
But you know, my ex-wife
and I had all those things,

14:20.987 --> 14:23.182
and our marriage
was an unmitigated disaster.

14:23.387 --> 14:25.742
She probably
just didn't appreciate you.

14:25.947 --> 14:27.744
No, not entirely.

14:28.547 --> 14:30.856
Did she listen
to your show every day,

14:31.067 --> 14:34.696
sometimes even tape it so she
could listen to it in bed at night?

14:34.907 --> 14:36.659
I didn't have a show then.

14:38.867 --> 14:43.782
I guess what it comes down to is...
What is that special something

14:43.987 --> 14:47.821
that makes us cry out,
"Yes, we are meant to be together"?

14:48.027 --> 14:51.622
Who knows? All that matters
is that we both feel it.

14:52.347 --> 14:53.382
Hmm?

14:53.547 --> 14:57.699
I would've told you months ago
how I felt, but I was too insecure.

14:57.907 --> 15:00.580
I never dreamed you felt
the same way I did.

15:03.987 --> 15:08.742
Frasier, don't turn shy
on me now. What you thinking?

15:11.827 --> 15:13.465
Elise, I'm...

15:13.627 --> 15:16.539

talking about my brother Niles

15:21.507 --> 15:23.657

Surely Roz must have told you.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.937
Oh, yeah.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.939
Sense of humour. That's another thing
that's important to have in common.

figure out why this decision

There's just so many things
to be considered, you know.

15:58.267 --> 16:02.499
On one hand, well, perhaps I'm afraid
that if Niles and Maris reconcile,

16:02.707 --> 16:06.017
we may lose the friendship he and I
developed during their separation.

16:07.907 --> 16:10.182
On the other hand, if Maris
does take him back,

16:10.387 --> 16:14.460
well, then, I won't have to feel
so responsible for him.
