00:15.067 --> 00:17.627
Do you think Maris and I
are meant to be together?

00:27.667 --> 00:30.227
MARTIN: Oh, what's this?
- I got you a gift.

00:30.427 --> 00:32.941
- You did? What's the occasion?
- No reason.

00:33.347 --> 00:34.985
You can't give something
for no reason.

00:35.187 --> 00:36.302
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

00:36.507 --> 00:37.622
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

00:37.827 --> 00:39.545
You're starting
to take the fun out of this.

00:39.987 --> 00:41.500
But there's no reason for this.

00:41.707 --> 00:43.345
- Does there have to be a reason?
- Yeah.

00:43.547 --> 00:47.586
- Oh, would you just open it?
- Oh, jeez.

00:47.787 --> 00:50.301
- I knitted it myself.
- Oh, gee...

00:50.507 --> 00:52.304
You know, I had trouble
with the rolled collar.

00:52.507 --> 00:54.975
I'm surprised you didn't hear me
cursing from my bedroom.

00:55.187 --> 00:58.816
Boy, Daphne, this is really nice.
I wish I had something to give you.

00:59.027 --> 01:00.983
- We're back on that again.
- All right, all right.

01:01.187 --> 01:04.099
- But at least let me pay you for it.
- Pay me for it? It's a gift.

01:04.307 --> 01:06.741
Just a couple bucks for the yarn.

01:08.187 --> 01:09.461
- Dad, has Niles called?
- No.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.658
I've been standing out front
for 20 minutes.

01:11.867 --> 01:14.301
We're gonna be late
for our squash court.

01:14.627 --> 01:17.346
- Nice cardigan.
- Daphne surprised me with it.

01:17.547 --> 01:18.946
You don't seem very happy about it.

01:19.147 --> 01:21.263
I'm not. I mean, you just
don't give somebody something

01:21.467 --> 01:24.459
- for no reason. That's my rule.
- Dad, spontaneous gift-giving

01:24.667 --> 01:26.146
is one of life's great pleasures.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.099
Didn't you give Mom anything
without warning?

01:28.307 --> 01:29.422
Yeah, you.

01:30.987 --> 01:32.579
Where do you think
I got the rule from?

[BELL DINGS]

01:34.227 --> 01:36.297
Oh, there you are. Come on,
Niles, let's shake a leg.

01:36.507 --> 01:38.577
- We'll be late for our court time.
- Just a minute.

01:38.787 --> 01:42.621
Of course I do, Maris.
Well, I miss you more.

01:42.827 --> 01:46.183
- No, I do. No, I do.
- Niles.

01:46.827 --> 01:50.024
More than Van Cleef
would miss Arpels.

01:50.507 --> 01:51.701
Oh, no, I don't.

01:51.867 --> 01:53.823
No, you have the prettier laugh.

01:54.027 --> 01:56.461
No, you do. No, you do.

01:56.667 --> 01:59.181
MARTIN:
I'm gonna go walk into the ocean.

02:00.547 --> 02:03.425
Oh, no, I would love to meet you
for lunch, but you know

02:03.627 --> 02:06.346
what Dr Deutsch said: No meetings
outside our therapy sessions.

02:06.547 --> 02:10.664
Oh, now, Maris... Oh, wait, hold on
a second. It's my other line. Hello.

02:10.866 --> 02:12.220
Get the hell off the phone.

02:18.107 --> 02:19.301
How rude.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.423
Please. You realize
it's also rude to be late?

02:21.587 --> 02:23.657
You're telling me about being late
for an appointment?

02:23.827 --> 02:25.738
FRASIER:
You're ridiculously tardy. Tardy, tardy.

02:25.907 --> 02:27.420
NILES: No, I think...
FRASIER: Forget it.

02:27.627 --> 02:30.221
How dare you hang up on me.

02:32.947 --> 02:34.505
Bunny?

02:35.307 --> 02:37.263
Do you mind if we
continue this conversation later?

02:37.427 --> 02:40.419
Oh, I'll be counting the minutes too.

02:40.787 --> 02:43.460
Well, I hope you're happy.
We have now officially lost our court.

02:43.667 --> 02:46.465
Well, I'm sorry. I would hope that
my attempt to salvage my marriage

02:46.667 --> 02:48.305
would be more important
than a squash game.

02:48.507 --> 02:50.577
Of course. I was just
looking forward to playing.

02:50.787 --> 02:52.857
I enjoy a morning game of squash
more than anyone.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.500
- No, I do.
- No, I do.

02:54.707 --> 02:56.379
No, no, stop it.

02:57.227 --> 02:59.695
Niles, I would love to see
you and Maris reconcile,

02:59.867 --> 03:02.904
if that's what you want. I'm just afraid
you might be going a bit too quickly.

03:03.067 --> 03:04.546
- Would you like some coffee?
- Please.

03:04.747 --> 03:07.261
Need I remind you last month
she served you with divorce papers?

03:07.467 --> 03:09.423
I'm aware of that.
We're not rushing into anything.

03:09.587 --> 03:11.464
We only see each other at therapy.

03:11.667 --> 03:14.579
That reminds me. Yesterday
at the cafÃ«, I asked you a question,

03:14.787 --> 03:16.425
which you deftly avoided answering.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.942
Do you think Maris and I
are meant to be together?

03:19.307 --> 03:21.218
Right. Well...

03:21.547 --> 03:23.538
That's a tough question.

03:24.147 --> 03:25.626
Perhaps the better question
would be,

03:25.787 --> 03:28.017
"Do you think you and Maris
are meant to be together?"

03:28.227 --> 03:30.661
I serve you up a question.
You clumsily bat it back to me.

03:30.867 --> 03:33.301
We've hardly missed
our squash game at all.

03:34.907 --> 03:37.341
No, no, I'm really interested
in your opinion.

03:37.547 --> 03:41.381
- Let's say you were God.
- Niles, please, I don't wanna play God.

03:42.227 --> 03:44.695
Please. No, just play along.

03:46.187 --> 03:49.065
Let's say you are the supreme
ruler of heaven and earth.

03:49.267 --> 03:50.985
- What would you do?
- Well, for starters,

03:51.187 --> 03:53.417
I'd issue a recall on some
of my lesser species.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

03:57.547 --> 03:58.616
L...

03:58.787 --> 04:02.257
I still want an answer
to that question. Hello?

04:02.467 --> 04:05.777
What is it, pumpkin?
Oh, now, now... Dear, calm down.

04:05.987 --> 04:08.421
I'm sure that the banging
you hear is just the pipes.

04:08.627 --> 04:10.822
If a servant had been
walled in during the remodelling,

04:11.027 --> 04:12.904
he'd have died weeks ago.

04:14.147 --> 04:17.696
If it will ease your mind at all, why
don't you have Marta take roll call?

04:17.906 --> 04:20.899
- Hold on a second. Hello?
- Get out.

04:27.627 --> 04:32.143
Well, this is Dr Frasier Crane, saying
goodbye and good mental health.

04:33.747 --> 04:35.021
Your brother called.

04:35.227 --> 04:37.377
Lord, he must really want
an answer to that question.

04:37.587 --> 04:39.976
No, he wanted to tell you
the wine-club meeting was cancelled.

04:40.187 --> 04:42.382
- What question?
- Yesterday, he asked me straight out

04:42.587 --> 04:44.578
if I thought he and Maris
were meant for each other.

04:44.787 --> 04:47.426
- That's a loaded question.
- Yeah, you're telling me.

04:47.627 --> 04:49.060
I don't even know
what my answer is.

04:49.427 --> 04:51.497
Why don't you just play it safe
and say yes?

04:51.707 --> 04:53.618
In my experience, when someone
asks that question,

04:53.827 --> 04:56.387
they're not looking for honesty,
they're looking for reassurance.

04:56.587 --> 04:59.101
- Tell him what he wants to hear.
- I don't know, Roz.

04:59.307 --> 05:03.220
Trust me, Frasier. It's like if I ask you,
"Do I look fat in these pants?"

05:03.427 --> 05:05.702
You're right. There's only one way
to answer that question.

05:05.907 --> 05:07.465
What?

05:07.987 --> 05:09.898
- Do you think I look fat in these?
- No, I don't.

05:10.067 --> 05:13.423
- I work out. It's the pleats, isn't it?
- Just stop it. Get ahold of yourself.

05:13.627 --> 05:16.505
I was thinking about what you
had said. I'm gonna tell Niles yes,

05:16.707 --> 05:19.380
I think he and Maris
were meant to be together.

05:20.067 --> 05:23.059
Who are you waving to? Is that
Elise Edmonds from Promotions?

05:23.267 --> 05:25.827
- We got a little date tonight.
- A date? And you didn't tell me?

05:26.027 --> 05:27.938
It's no big deal.
I don't think she's interested.

05:28.107 --> 05:29.460
- Hi, Frasier. Hey, Roz.
FRASIER Hi.

05:29.627 --> 05:31.583
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I just wanted to make sure.

05:31.747 --> 05:33.578
- Am I still seeing you tonight?
- Yes, you are.

05:33.787 --> 05:36.381
Which means, of course,
that I'll be seeing you as well.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.306
Great. Bye.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.986
Whoa!

05:42.227 --> 05:44.218
That woman is totally into you.

- You think so?
- Yeah. "I'll see you later. Great. Bye."

05:50.307 --> 05:51.660
- And that's a good sign?
- Hello.

05:51.867 --> 05:54.745
She might as well have calf-roped
you with her pantyhose.

05:54.947 --> 05:56.858
This promises to be
a very interesting evening.

05:57.027 --> 05:59.939
- I think so.
- Well, she is very attractive. Slender.

06:00.147 --> 06:01.739
Gee, I wonder why
your mind went there.

06:01.947 --> 06:04.063
- Not this again, Roz.
- Of course. She was next to me.

06:04.227 --> 06:05.296
I hate these pants.

- I look like the Liberty Bell.
- The Liberty Bell...

- Afternoon, Mr Crane.
- Hello.

06:21.267 --> 06:23.701
- I've got the mail.
- Oh, thanks.

06:23.907 --> 06:26.705
You wanna just
put it on the table there?

06:27.347 --> 06:28.336
Is this for me?

06:28.547 --> 06:32.460
You know anybody else around here
who uses eucalyptus bubble bath?

06:32.867 --> 06:36.223
- Well, your son occasionally likes...
- Oh, never mind.

06:36.747 --> 06:39.102
- This is lovely.
- Well, I'm glad you like it,

06:39.307 --> 06:40.899
because I picked it all out myself.

06:41.107 --> 06:44.702
You know, I got you your fancy
soaps, and your moisturizers,

06:44.867 --> 06:49.338
and this rock thing that scrapes all the
dead skin off the bottom of your feet.

06:50.387 --> 06:53.743
Well, if you're gonna nap
on the couch, wear slippers.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.666
- Still, Mr Crane, you really overdid it.
- No, I didn't.

06:56.867 --> 06:59.176
- I don't know if I can accept this.
- Why not?

06:59.387 --> 07:01.139
Because you spent far too much.

07:01.347 --> 07:03.986
All right. Well, then, I'll take
a couple of things back.

07:04.187 --> 07:05.666
Wait, not that one.

07:05.867 --> 07:08.540
Daphne, would you please
just take the damn basket?

07:08.747 --> 07:10.339
What are you getting
so cross about?

07:10.547 --> 07:13.380
You can give me a gift, but I'm
not allowed to give you one back?

07:13.587 --> 07:16.420
- That's the reason you gave me this?
- Yeah, that's the way it works.

07:16.627 --> 07:18.458
Where I come from,
you don't give someone a gift

07:18.667 --> 07:21.056
because you have to.
Here, take your silly basket.

07:21.267 --> 07:24.942
All right, fine. Well, then, you can take
your crappy old cardigan back too.

07:25.147 --> 07:27.058
I don't know why you gave it
to me in the first place.

07:27.227 --> 07:28.865
- Because I like you.
- Well, I like you.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.058
Than why can't you just accept
my gift and be happy?

07:31.267 --> 07:34.259
- I am happy. I love that cardigan.
- And I love my damn basket.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.776
- What is all this?
- We're exchanging our damn gifts.

07:36.987 --> 07:38.739

Well, here.

07:38.947 --> 07:39.936

Thank you.

07:42.947 --> 07:44.096
Good Lord.

07:44.307 --> 07:47.504
It's like Christmas morning
in the Gambino household.

07:52.707 --> 07:55.301
By the way, Niles called while you
were in the shower to remind you

07:55.507 --> 07:56.656
about the squash tomorrow.

07:57.267 --> 07:59.781
That's strange. We just made that
date this morning. He must be

07:59.947 --> 08:02.017
champing at the bit to get
an answer to that question.

08:02.227 --> 08:03.262
What question?

08:03.467 --> 08:07.016
Oh, he asked me if I thought he
and Maris were meant to be together.

08:07.227 --> 08:09.616
Well, if you ask me,
you should keep your bazoo shut.

08:09.827 --> 08:12.739
You're always getting in trouble
opening that big bazoo of yours.

08:12.947 --> 08:15.825
How wonderful, Dad. We found a new
word to strike from your vocabulary,

08:16.027 --> 08:19.144
along with patootie and bupkis.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.700
You're gonna answer him, aren't you?

08:22.227 --> 08:24.536
I think I have to. But listen,
I'm just gonna play it safe.

08:24.747 --> 08:26.738
Tell him yes. He's gonna do
what he wants to anyway.

08:26.947 --> 08:29.097
I don't know. He takes
your opinion pretty seriously.

08:29.307 --> 08:31.537
Well, when we were younger,
there was a certain sway

08:31.707 --> 08:32.856
I had over him, but...

08:33.067 --> 08:35.626
Do you remember back in prep
school when he was gonna try out

08:35.827 --> 08:37.897
for the track team?
I convinced him all the cool kids

08:38.107 --> 08:40.177
were gonna join the Madrigal Society?

08:41.307 --> 08:43.537
I'm not just talking about school.
He's always come to you

08:43.746 --> 08:46.022
for career decisions too.
Where to do his residency,

08:46.227 --> 08:47.660
where to set up his practice.

08:48.627 --> 08:51.095
Perhaps I have
underestimated my influence.

08:51.307 --> 08:52.979
You know, frankly,
my opinion could be

08:53.187 --> 08:55.576
the single most important factor
in his making this decision.

08:55.787 --> 08:57.937
- I don't know if I'd go as far as that.
- Please, Dad.

08:58.147 --> 09:00.741
You don't know what it's like
to have your opinion matter.

09:03.307 --> 09:06.697
Niles depends on me. He deserves
my true and honest answer.

09:06.867 --> 09:08.823
- And what is that?
- Well...

09:09.467 --> 09:11.059
Maris has always been
spoiled and selfish

09:11.267 --> 09:13.064
and led him around by the nose.

09:13.467 --> 09:15.105
I'd have to say my answer
would be no.

09:16.067 --> 09:18.979
Thank you, Dad. I've changed
my answer from a yes to a no.

09:19.187 --> 09:20.586
MARTIN:
There you go.

09:20.787 --> 09:23.255
FRASIER: On the other hand...
MARTIN: I knew it.

09:24.347 --> 09:26.986
Well, no, you know, there are
a lot of other factors here, Dad.

09:27.827 --> 09:30.295
Niles does love Maris.

09:31.107 --> 09:34.656
She has agreed to go into therapy,
and Niles swears

09:34.867 --> 09:36.903
that she's a changed person. L...

09:37.107 --> 09:39.575
I don't know. I guess if I really
wanna know what's going on

09:39.787 --> 09:41.937
in Maris' mind,
I've got to ask her myself.

09:42.507 --> 09:45.783
- You agree with that, don't you, Dad?
MARTIN: Oh, yeah, sure.

09:47.067 --> 09:49.262
FRASIER: Well, I've got
a couple hours before my date.

09:49.467 --> 09:51.503
So if I really wanna know
what Maris is thinking,

09:51.707 --> 09:53.982
I will go directly to the source.

09:55.427 --> 09:57.577
- Are you ready to order?
- Well, not quite yet.

09:57.787 --> 10:01.143
I'm still waiting on someone.
Oh, there she is now.

10:04.427 --> 10:06.304
Marta.

10:09.947 --> 10:12.097
Marta, I can't tell you how nice
it is to see you again.

10:12.307 --> 10:17.301
My pleasure. And this coffee
is too, too divine.

10:17.907 --> 10:20.341
I see your English lessons
with Maris are progressing nicely.

10:20.547 --> 10:22.219
Yes. She teaching me many words.

10:22.627 --> 10:26.097
That coat is so dÃ«classÃ«.

10:27.507 --> 10:30.499
Listen, Marta, I'm gonna come
right to my point.

10:31.227 --> 10:34.936
Dr Crane and Maris... Missy Crane.

10:35.467 --> 10:38.220
- Have been seeing
a couples' therapist lately,

10:38.427 --> 10:42.261
- and I understand it's going very well.
- Therapy helping Missy Crane a lot.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.186
Really? So you would say
that she's a changed person?

10:45.387 --> 10:49.619
<i>Si, si. Missy Crane very different,
nicer to everyone.</i>

10:49.827 --> 10:52.057
And this time no happy pills.

10:54.507 --> 10:58.182
For my birthday, she gave me
beautiful Chanel makeup bag.

10:58.387 --> 11:01.060
It's a knockoff, but it's big.

11:02.107 --> 11:05.179
Oh, all right then,
this is my question:

11:05.547 --> 11:08.823
If Dr Crane and Mrs Crane
were to get back together again,

11:09.027 --> 11:10.460
do you?

11:11.027 --> 11:15.737
Do you think that Mrs Crane
would treat Dr Crane better?

11:15.947 --> 11:19.781
Oh, yes. Please ask
Dr Crane to come home.

11:19.987 --> 11:23.582
Marta, you've been most helpful.
You know, lately, I've been wondering

11:23.787 --> 11:25.539
if Niles and Maris ought
to be together.

11:25.747 --> 11:28.739
And now, thanks to you, I know that
the answer to that question is yes.

11:28.907 --> 11:29.896
[MARTA LAUGHS]

11:30.067 --> 11:31.136
What?
Did I say something funny?

11:31.347 --> 11:34.657
No, my beeper on vibrate.
It tickle me.

11:36.107 --> 11:38.337
Sorry. I have to go.
Missy Crane need me.

11:38.507 --> 11:41.943
<i>- Oh, thanks, all right. I understand.
- Thanks for cafe.</i>

11:42.107 --> 11:44.223
Call me. Mean it.

11:45.027 --> 11:47.257
Well, there is a limit.

11:48.067 --> 11:49.420
- Hey.
- Oh, Daphne.

11:49.627 --> 11:51.538
Was that Mrs Crane's Marta
who was just leaving?

11:51.747 --> 11:53.738
It was.
We were just sharing a coffee.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.745
Marta helped allay my fears about
Niles and Maris getting back together.

11:56.947 --> 11:59.859
Yes, I think she'd be glad to see
Dr Crane back in that household.

12:00.547 --> 12:02.936
- I should go get my beans.
- Wait, Daphne. What do you mean?

12:03.147 --> 12:05.183
Well, I'm sure Dr Crane
acts as a good buffer

12:05.387 --> 12:06.900
between Mrs Crane and the help.

12:07.547 --> 12:10.300
Gee, it never occurred to me that
Marta might have an ulterior motive.

12:10.507 --> 12:13.067
Who could blame her?
Mrs Crane can be a bit demanding.

12:13.267 --> 12:16.384
Well, then, this taints
Marta's entire testimony.

12:16.587 --> 12:19.021
Is it possible
she could have lied to me?

12:19.227 --> 12:22.663
No. With my trained eye, very
few things can escape my notice,

12:22.827 --> 12:25.022
as I'm sure
you've observed, Daphne.

12:25.947 --> 12:28.461
You think that l...?
But could she have lied to me?

12:28.667 --> 12:30.464
You know, see,
this is the predicament I'm in.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.135
Every time someone gives me
a valid argument, somebody else

12:33.347 --> 12:35.941
comes along, gives me
a perfectly valid counterargument.

12:36.147 --> 12:39.662
One minute I think the answer is yes,
the next minute I think it's no.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.700
This is driving me crazy.
No, I've got to stick with it.

12:43.907 --> 12:47.377
Niles asked me what I think...
That's it. What I think.

12:47.587 --> 12:48.940
I don't know
what I think right now.

12:49.147 --> 12:51.058
But that's where I should focus.
Don't you agree?

12:51.267 --> 12:53.940
Oh, yes, absolutely.

12:59.867 --> 13:03.018
ELISE: Oh, I'm so glad
we're finally doing this.

13:03.907 --> 13:07.104
- Oh, yeah, me too.
- Is everything all right, Frasier?

13:07.307 --> 13:11.300
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
I'm just a little preoccupied.

13:12.027 --> 13:13.745
Stop obsessing.

13:13.947 --> 13:15.938
Enjoy the date.

13:21.587 --> 13:23.179
Here we are.

13:24.307 --> 13:25.456
So where are we going?

13:25.667 --> 13:28.340
I've chosen a little Italian place
I know, if that's all right.

13:28.547 --> 13:29.821
- I trust your judgement.
- Okay.

13:30.027 --> 13:31.346
But then, who doesn't?

13:36.467 --> 13:37.741
Are you okay?

13:38.507 --> 13:40.896
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.503
I told myself I wasn't gonna
bring this up to you.

13:43.707 --> 13:45.937
I don't really think
it's appropriate for a first date,

13:46.147 --> 13:50.060
but I haven't been able to think about
anything else all day, so here goes.

13:51.307 --> 13:53.457
Do you think it's possible

13:53.667 --> 13:58.104
for two people
to be meant for each other?

13:59.747 --> 14:03.660
- You've thought about that all day?
- Yes.

14:03.867 --> 14:06.427
- Well, yes, I do.
- I do too.

14:06.627 --> 14:10.540
But how do you know that they're
meant for each other?

14:10.747 --> 14:13.705
Of course, it's essential that they have
similar interests, goals in common.

14:13.907 --> 14:17.058
- Don't forget physical attraction.
- Oh, well, that's a given. Yeah.

14:18.347 --> 14:20.577
But you know, my ex-wife
and I had all those things,

14:20.987 --> 14:23.182
and our marriage
was an unmitigated disaster.

14:23.387 --> 14:25.742
She probably
just didn't appreciate you.

14:25.947 --> 14:27.744
No, not entirely.

14:28.547 --> 14:30.856
Did she listen
to your show every day,

14:31.067 --> 14:34.696
sometimes even tape it so she
could listen to it in bed at night?

14:34.907 --> 14:36.659
I didn't have a show then.

14:38.867 --> 14:43.782
I guess what it comes down to is...
What is that special something

14:43.987 --> 14:47.821
that makes us cry out,
"Yes, we are meant to be together"?

14:48.027 --> 14:51.622
Who knows? All that matters
is that we both feel it.

14:52.347 --> 14:53.382
Hmm?

14:53.547 --> 14:57.699
I would've told you months ago
how I felt, but I was too insecure.

14:57.907 --> 15:00.580
I never dreamed you felt
the same way I did.

15:03.987 --> 15:08.742
Frasier, don't turn shy
on me now. What you thinking?

15:11.827 --> 15:13.465
Elise, I'm...

15:13.627 --> 15:16.539

talking about my brother Niles

15:21.507 --> 15:23.657

Surely Roz must have told you.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.937
Oh, yeah.

Sense of humour. That's another thing
that's important to have in common.

figure out why this decision

There's just so many things
to be considered, you know.

15:58.267 --> 16:02.499
On one hand, well, perhaps I'm afraid
that if Niles and Maris reconcile,

16:02.707 --> 16:06.017
we may lose the friendship he and I
developed during their separation.

16:07.907 --> 16:10.182
On the other hand, if Maris
does take him back,

16:10.387 --> 16:14.460
well, then, I won't have to feel
so responsible for him.
