[music playing]

01:33.594 --> 01:34.395
Gah!

01:34.495 --> 01:35.863
Dad, you slept late.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.097
Yeah.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.899
Well it's Saturday morning.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.468
Two for two.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.035
You forgot what you
were going to do today?

01:42.136 --> 01:43.771
No way.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.339
I'm going to eat
a big breakfast,

01:45.439 --> 01:48.342
grab that sports page, and
hide in the john until lunch.

01:48.442 --> 01:52.546
You did forget,
I can't believe it.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.447
Little help.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.316

[mimics sirens]

01:59.220 --> 02:01.655
Oh, yeah, your driving lesson.

02:01.755 --> 02:02.890
Well, let's go.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.057
Becky, we've got all day.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.659
Dad, that's what
you said last week.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.027
But all I did the
whole day was hope

02:07.127 --> 02:09.197
you wash your car because,
(WITH A DEEP VOICE)

02:09.297 --> 02:12.766
a clean car is an aerodynamic

02:12.866 --> 02:14.368
[laughing] I guess
there's no way you're going

02:14.468 --> 02:16.604
to fall for that again, huh?

02:16.704 --> 02:18.872
Dad, I think I'm ready
for that next step.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.108
Which would you be
turning innocent pedestrians

02:21.209 --> 02:22.910
into street pizza.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.879
Shut up, Darlene.

02:25.979 --> 02:26.914
Dad, come on.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.816
Becky, it's Saturday.

02:28.916 --> 02:29.917
It's the one day
of the week when

02:30.017 --> 02:33.053
we can all spend time together.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.323
Boy, it's just a
beautiful morning today.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.990
It just makes me want to sing.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.836
Why don't you guys
get out of here?

02:48.936 --> 02:50.037
Come on, go.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.305
I have to stay here
because I'm going to clean.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.240
But you can get out.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.374
It's beautiful, go.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.742
Unless you want to
stay here and help me.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.645
Can't, promised
Becky driving lessons.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.879
Well, all right.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.180
Can I get your car keys?

03:00.281 --> 03:01.081
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:01.181 --> 03:01.982
Here they are.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.317
Now get out of here.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.619
What, no jokes about how
bad a driver I'm going to be?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.455
Didn't darling
take care of that?

03:07.555 --> 03:08.956
Yeah, I crushed her.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.491
All right, there you go.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.260
So what's keeping you?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.928
Oh, and Dan, you better take
DJ here to his den meeting.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.597
I don't have a den meeting?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.467
Then how come you're
wearing your uniform, stupid?

03:19.567 --> 03:22.069
I slept in it, stupid.

03:22.169 --> 03:25.138
Ah, I remember my days
as a scout, especially

03:25.239 --> 03:27.040
the wilderness training.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.477
We couldn't find any wilderness,
so the scout master dropped us

03:29.577 --> 03:30.744
off in downtown Chicago.

03:30.844 --> 03:34.448
And we had to try to make
it back here on our own.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.949
I was one of the lucky ones.

03:36.049 --> 03:36.884
Dan.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.352
Scout's honor.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.853
Becky's waiting for
a driving lesson, here.

03:39.953 --> 03:40.988
Yeah, Dad.
Can we go?

03:41.088 --> 03:41.955
All right.

03:42.055 --> 03:42.823
Can I get something
to eat first?

03:42.923 --> 03:44.292
No, take it you, Dan.
Come on.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.192
Am I talking English?

03:45.293 --> 03:46.294
Everybody get out of here.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.495
Take Darlene with you.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.229
Well gee, Mom, I thought
I'd hang around so I can

03:49.330 --> 03:50.398
be here when you get the call.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.632
- What call?
- Oh, you know.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.701
The one from the Highway
Patrol telling you they've

03:53.801 --> 03:57.104
found your husband and
most of your daughter.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.972
What is it going
to take to get you

03:59.072 --> 04:00.274
guys to get out of the house?

04:00.374 --> 04:02.142
Hi, everybody.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.446
Roseanne, I thought this was
going to be your morning alone.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.647
Well, it was supposed to be.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.882
But they just won't go away.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.852
They're like something stuck
to the bottom of your shoe.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.287
Like gum?

04:13.387 --> 04:15.323
No, not like gum.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.794
It's like being
a spy or something.

04:20.894 --> 04:21.695
Yeah.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.498
Yeah, yeah.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.499
Is that it?

04:25.599 --> 04:26.767
Yep.

04:26.867 --> 04:30.170
It's the most accurate
pregnancy test on the market.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.305
All right, well let's go?

04:31.405 --> 04:32.340
All right, relax will you.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.407
What's the matter?

04:33.507 --> 04:36.510
I mean aside from
being nine days late.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.879
Well, you told me to save my
first morning's urine, right?

04:38.979 --> 04:40.280
I've been saving
it for seven hours.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.718
Are you sure Dan doesn't know?

04:44.818 --> 04:46.554
No, he thinks I'm
right on schedule.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.589
How'd you manage that?

04:48.689 --> 04:49.590
I faked PMS.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.196
I even added an extra
day for the heck of it.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.065
Hey.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.232
I told Crystal, thought.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.634
You know I had to.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.235
You know how she keeps track of
everybody's time of the month

05:02.336 --> 05:03.236
so she can send a card.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.705
Yeah.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.606
So let's go.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.140
All right, what
do we got here?

05:07.240 --> 05:11.278
Directions, test kit.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.946
What is this for?

05:13.046 --> 05:14.748
That holds the urine.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.487
No, no, no.

05:19.587 --> 05:23.391
You do it in the lid first,
and then you use that dropper.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.324
Well then give me the lid.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.159
No, I gotta wash it out first.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.462
[running water]

05:30.831 --> 05:32.366
Oh, hey.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.401
I got coupons.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.435
You gonna use these?

05:37.438 --> 05:39.272
All right, so [inaudible].

05:39.373 --> 05:40.741
It's clean, it's
clean, it's clean.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.209
[knock on the door]

05:42.309 --> 05:43.411
Hi.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.745
Come on in, hurry up.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.046
Are they all still out there?

05:46.146 --> 05:48.148
Well yeah, but I didn't
tell them anything.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.983
I just said hi and
headed straight in here.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.251
I bet they think
we're in here doing

05:51.351 --> 05:53.654
some weird shaving ritual.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.789
I don't know why you
just don't tell Dan.

05:55.889 --> 05:56.924
Because there's
nothing to tell.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.559
And I mean, if it does
come out positive,

05:58.659 --> 05:59.760
I got to think of
some way to tell

05:59.860 --> 06:01.629
him so his head don't explode.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.964
Well how'd you tell him
about your other kids?

06:04.064 --> 06:07.701
Well, with Becky I
said, Dan get a job.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.871
With Darlene I said,
Dan get a better job.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.540
And DJ?

06:12.640 --> 06:15.275
Oh, do I have to
tell him about DJ?

06:18.512 --> 06:20.280
Come on, Roseanne.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.016
You got to be a little excited
about maybe being pregnant.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.084
Yeah.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.554
I can hardly wait
to start puking.

06:26.654 --> 06:29.457
Come on, you guys or my
water's going to break here.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.792
[knocking on the door]

06:31.892 --> 06:35.128
DAN: Roseanne, what the
hell's going on in there?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.964
We're worshipping
Satan, honey.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.366
We'll be right out.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.333
DAN: Come on, Roseanne.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.906
All right, come on in.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.942
The kids don't
need to hear this.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.278
Ah.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.680
Ah.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.947
I get it.

06:54.047 --> 06:54.848
Dan.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.017
Roseanne, it's OK.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.187
What a person does with her
life is her own business.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.288
So what happened, Jackie?

07:01.388 --> 07:02.456
Did you get drunk and
forget that there's

07:02.556 --> 07:04.992
like a zillion kinds of
birth control out there?

07:05.092 --> 07:08.228
[laughing]

07:08.328 --> 07:10.097
Does Gary know?

07:10.197 --> 07:10.998
No, Dan.

07:11.098 --> 07:11.899
He doesn't.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.368
Gary is a father, right?

07:15.469 --> 07:16.470
If you say so.

07:19.206 --> 07:22.710
Word of advice from a man, OK?

07:22.810 --> 07:25.613
Don't say a word
until you do the test.

07:25.713 --> 07:28.415
You don't want to upset the
guy if you don't have to.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.984
You know, I was just saying
that, like, very same thing.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.754
You know, I was saying that
if it does come up positive,

07:33.854 --> 07:35.455
the best way to do
it is just short,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.357
sweet, and right to the point.

07:37.457 --> 07:41.829
You know, kind of
like, I'm pregnant Dan.

07:41.929 --> 07:42.730
Gary.

07:42.830 --> 07:43.797
Dan.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.198
- Gary.
- Dan.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.099
Gary!

07:50.303 --> 07:52.205
Do we have to have this little
moment in front of everybody?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.941
No, we can get out of here.

07:54.041 --> 07:54.842
Thank you.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.347
How late?

08:00.447 --> 08:01.582
Nine days.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.651
When did this happen?

08:03.751 --> 08:06.419
What we were having sex.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.622
But we're always careful.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.824
Whoops.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.560
Come on, honey, go.
I gotta do this now.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.426
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:13.527 --> 08:14.695
Can I--

08:20.467 --> 08:22.402
So, you guys
did it again, huh?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.436
Did what?

08:23.537 --> 08:24.938
They were listening
at the door, Dan.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.339
Great.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.275
Like it's not bad enough that
we've got this little accident

08:28.375 --> 08:29.743
running around.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.378
Who's an accident?

08:31.478 --> 08:32.913
How can somebody be an accident?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.648
Oh great, ask me.

08:34.748 --> 08:35.816
Thanks Darlene.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.551
I'm stressed out, OK.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.819
Well just once
maybe you could think

08:38.919 --> 08:40.453
before you open your big mouth.

08:40.554 --> 08:41.421
ROSEANNE: Would you be quiet?

08:41.521 --> 08:43.023
I'm trying to go.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.491
[shushing]

08:44.592 --> 08:47.728
Shut up.

08:47.828 --> 08:51.765
ROSEANNE: Well, make some noise.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.000
I can't believe you, Darlene.

08:53.100 --> 08:53.934
You are so insensitive.

08:54.034 --> 08:54.835
Yeah?

08:54.935 --> 08:56.069
Well you got a big butt.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.906
Cut it out.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.574
No need for any
of this right now.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.909
Your father's right.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.544
And we don't want to upset
your mother in her condition.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.512
So it's true?

09:05.613 --> 09:06.446
We don't know yet.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.514
And can we just
keep a lid on it?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.054
What?

09:14.154 --> 09:15.122
Come on, Roseanne.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.023
Oh no, no.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.357
That test takes 10 minutes.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.192
So just do what you were
doing and try to forget

09:19.292 --> 09:20.227
about it the next 10 minutes.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.233
[ticking clock]

09:30.170 --> 09:34.141
Eight minutes and 16 seconds.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.743
Thank you, DJ.

09:35.843 --> 09:36.644
You're welcome.

09:36.744 --> 09:37.978
I'm sorry, Roseanne.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.547
But I'm just so excited about
this, I could bust in two.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.950
I swear, it's like
having a baby of my own.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.919
Well you know, now
it's not positive yet.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.320
I know.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.257
But thinking about it gets my
biological clock ticking away.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.225
Tick, tick, tick.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.227
Just hope I can do something
about it before the battery

09:54.327 --> 09:56.163
goes dead.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.564
Do you want another kid?

09:57.665 --> 10:00.133
Well it does make me a little
sad to think of my Lonnie

10:00.233 --> 10:01.969
as an only child.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.137
And I guess I kind of regret
not having that little girl

10:04.237 --> 10:05.505
I always dreamed about.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.439
Yeah, me too.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.811
What about you, Jackie?

10:10.911 --> 10:13.446
I bet your little
clock's all wound up.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.249
Crystal, I'm a cop.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.388
Cops can get pregnant
just like everyone else.

10:21.488 --> 10:24.457
Yeah, but when she wakes
up depressed, and bloated,

10:24.557 --> 10:28.896
and hating the whole world,
she gets to carry a gun.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.397
Seven minutes and 34 seconds.

10:30.497 --> 10:31.298
[crash]

10:31.398 --> 10:32.199
DJ!

10:35.769 --> 10:36.536
Thank you.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.637
You're welcome.

10:37.738 --> 10:38.605
Crystal, maybe we oughtta--

10:38.706 --> 10:39.740
No, you guys hang out.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.909
I gotta-- having trouble
with this thing here.

10:42.009 --> 10:45.045
I gotta go out in the
garage and get another tool.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.580
Well the toaster's
not even broke.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.182
He just doesn't want to
talk about any of this.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.719
Well, maybe you ought
to go out there after him.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.320
No, let him sit
out there and nail

10:53.420 --> 10:54.487
something else for a while.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.327
I think he's
pretty sure the test

11:00.427 --> 11:01.729
is going to come out positive.

11:01.829 --> 11:02.796
Well, I don't know why.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.733
I've only been late
3 times in my life.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.301
Here are two of them now.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.103
Mom look, we really got
to talk about all this.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.038
Because--

11:11.138 --> 11:12.305
Mom, I've decided
it's OK for you

11:12.405 --> 11:13.273
to bring a baby into the
house, as long as we can agree

11:13.373 --> 11:14.274
on a couple of conditions.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.743
I can't believe you, Darlene.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.644
I was already talking,
now get out of here.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.547
No, I want to hear
your conditions.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.648
Oh, that's quite all right.

11:21.749 --> 11:22.682
You can just go right ahead.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.017
Oh, no, no.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.519
Come on, let it rip.

11:26.619 --> 11:27.687
All right, OK.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.190
Now say I brought a
puppy into this house.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.859
It would be my puppy.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.661
And I would have to
take care of it, right?

11:34.762 --> 11:35.896
Well, I just
don't think you're

11:35.996 --> 11:37.731
going to have that much time
to take care of a puppy.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.399
What, with all the work
you're going to be doing

11:39.499 --> 11:42.870
with the new baby and all.

11:42.970 --> 11:46.006
You don't get this, do you?

11:46.106 --> 11:47.707
Yeah, you do.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.943
I don't think it's fair that
you should expect me to clean

11:50.043 --> 11:53.313
the baby, or wash it, or
watch it while it sleeps,

11:53.413 --> 11:54.714
or change it's diapers--

11:54.815 --> 11:55.983
I guess what
you're saying here

11:56.083 --> 11:58.551
is that you just feel
that three children

11:58.651 --> 12:01.054
are enough for this house.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.189
Well, Yeah.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.556
Yeah.

12:03.656 --> 12:04.892
We're going to
miss you, Darlene.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.463
So, what's your beef?

12:10.563 --> 12:11.832
Uh, do you think
we can maybe--

12:14.835 --> 12:16.669
Are you getting
all this, Crystal?

12:16.770 --> 12:17.670
Your clock still ticking?

12:20.273 --> 12:22.609
Mother, I'm turning
16 this year, right?

12:22.709 --> 12:26.479
Well, I guess that depends
on what you're about to say.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.181
Well, so this is
a big year for me.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.183
I mean, I was going to
maybe get a sweet 16 party.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.919
And if I don't, my friends will.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.286
And hey, Ma, I just
can't be wearing

12:33.386 --> 12:34.387
the same clothes every time.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.288
Oh god, no.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.756
What would people say?

12:36.857 --> 12:38.959
Yeah, and Dad was talking
about maybe getting some old

12:39.059 --> 12:40.994
beat up car that he
could fix up for me.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.329
So?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.263
So?

12:43.363 --> 12:45.833
So none of this is
going to happen.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.735
I mean, when DJ was a baby,
I was seven years old.

12:48.836 --> 12:49.769
But I still remember this.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.939
It was always, oh,
the baby needs this.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.173
And the baby needs that.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.108
And I'm always the one
who has to do with things

12:55.208 --> 12:56.944
because I'm the oldest.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.145
And hey, what about college?

12:58.245 --> 12:59.379
Don't you want me
to go to college?

12:59.479 --> 13:00.680
No, Becky.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.017
Your father and I want you
to work in a bowling alley.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.054
It was kind of our dream.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.722
Well, I guess you'll just
never understand how I feel.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.925
Because when you were
16, you had a car.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.861
Yeah, well, maybe that had
to do something with the fact

13:13.961 --> 13:15.996
that when I was 16,
I also had a job.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.400
Well just forget it.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.935
I mean, I don't even know
what you were thinking

13:22.035 --> 13:23.636
when you were making this baby.

13:23.736 --> 13:24.972
I'll tell you
what I was thinking.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.374
I was thinking, I wonder if
I could get pregnant so I

13:27.474 --> 13:30.643
could louse up Becky's life.

13:30.743 --> 13:31.544
[door slams]

13:31.644 --> 13:32.712
She's a little brat.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.181
I can never [inaudible].

13:37.017 --> 13:37.885
I agree.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.452
Can you believe
how selfish she is?

13:39.552 --> 13:40.420
I mean, I am overwhelmed--

13:40.520 --> 13:41.588
Go to your room
and live in fear.

13:44.591 --> 13:48.495
And to think I suckled them.

13:48.595 --> 13:49.963
They're just upset, Roseanne.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.599
It's a lot for them
handle all at once.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.734
How much longer until
this test is over?

13:54.834 --> 13:58.872
DJ: Four minutes and 19 seconds.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.308
I'm going to make coffee.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.877
You know, Roseanne, if you
don't want to have this baby,

14:03.977 --> 14:06.013
you could get an abortion.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.948
Some say that's
murder, Roseanne.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.616
And some say it's not.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.151
And some say you got a choice.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.786
But we don't even know the
results of the test yet,

14:13.887 --> 14:17.024
so we're talking
about coffee now.

14:17.124 --> 14:21.194
Roseanne, bedroom.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.996
Ooh, foreplay for a change.

14:25.732 --> 14:26.900
Should have
happened, Roseanne.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.301
We took precautions.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.070
Yeah, well they didn't work.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.972
Well, you should have known
it was your fertile time.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.375
Well excuse me for ovulating.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.543
I didn't mean that.

14:36.643 --> 14:37.877
Well, you meant something
like that, something

14:37.978 --> 14:40.613
like it's my fault. And
the whole family is sitting

14:40.713 --> 14:41.848
there thinking it's my fault.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.250
Well, I didn't mean that.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.920
I guess I mean, I'm feeling a
little Old for this, you know?

14:47.020 --> 14:48.121
I'm 38.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.757
What, like I'm 25?

14:50.857 --> 14:51.992
We're not yuppies.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.161
I mean, it ain't hip for
us to be having babies now.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.996
We had them when we
were young and stupid,

14:56.096 --> 14:59.432
like we were supposed to.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.734
I just guess I'm feeling a
little weird that we have to go

15:01.834 --> 15:03.236
through this whole thing again.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.805
Jeez, you are just
as bad as the kids.

15:05.905 --> 15:09.542
We have to go through
this whole thing again?

15:09.642 --> 15:11.945
You know, well maybe
if we pull together,

15:12.045 --> 15:16.383
we all can make this pregnancy
thing a lot easier on us.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.818
Yeah, like, OK,
I'll carry the baby.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.720
But Darlene gets to have
the morning sickness.

15:20.820 --> 15:21.989
And Becky can have
the backaches.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.224
And I'll save the
hemorrhoids for you, Dan.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.226
And then the kid's
born, you know,

15:26.326 --> 15:27.527
I'll be in charge of diapering.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.929
But you get up 12 times a
night and breastfeed it.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.232
Is that cool?

15:32.332 --> 15:33.666
Yeah, I've always
helped, Roseanne.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.135
And I'm going to help this time.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.137
But don't go calling me
selfish just because I thought,

15:37.237 --> 15:40.507
finally we'd have some time
for ourselves after 16 years.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.509
You've had nine days
to get used to this.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.044
I've had 10 minutes.

15:44.144 --> 15:47.981
DJ: Almost Done, Mom, Dad.

15:48.081 --> 15:51.284
One minute and 58 seconds.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.820
Thank you, DJ.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.788
Was I an accident?

15:59.326 --> 16:02.462
No DJ, you were a surprise.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.631
What's the difference?

16:04.731 --> 16:08.801
Well, an accident is
something that if you had to do

16:08.901 --> 16:11.038
it over again, you wouldn't.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.940
But a surprise is something
that you didn't even know

16:14.041 --> 16:15.908
you wanted till you got it.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.777
Was Darlene an accident?

16:17.877 --> 16:18.845
No, Darlene was a disaster.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.052
Darlene says I'm not going
to be the baby anymore,

16:25.152 --> 16:28.255
so nobody's going to
pay any attention to me.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.789
Well, I'll tell
you what, honey.

16:29.889 --> 16:34.761
How about if we pay lots and
lots of attention to you?

16:34.861 --> 16:37.330
I'll be happy if
you have a baby.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.798
Oh, that's so sweet.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.900
Finally, I get a
chance to kick some butt.

16:46.639 --> 16:47.940
Ah, tradition.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.343
It's a remarkable thing.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.411
[timer dings]

16:51.511 --> 16:54.481
Time, it's time,
it's time, it's time!

16:54.581 --> 16:56.383
You know, I might
not even be pregnant.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.186
So we might be sitting
here yelling for no reason.

16:59.286 --> 17:02.789
No, we're rehearsing
for next time.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.158
No, there's not going to
be any next time because I'm

17:05.258 --> 17:07.660
just going to go get fixed.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.796
You mean get your tubes tied?

17:09.896 --> 17:11.764
No, I mean get my
knees sewn together.

17:17.870 --> 17:18.671
I'm serious.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.907
That's, like an operation.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.742
You'd be in the hospital.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.345
Well you know, Dan, it's
just a little bit more

17:25.445 --> 17:28.348
complicated than,
say a vasectomy.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.622
Yeah, well, you know what?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.290
You're right.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.493
I could take a half day off of
work and drive you down there.

17:40.593 --> 17:41.394
Uh-huh.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.666
So, you want to be alone or--

17:46.766 --> 17:48.701
No, come on in.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.403
All right, what do
I do now, Jackie?

17:50.503 --> 17:52.004
Just read the test stick.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.506
Pink is yes and white is no.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.680
Aunt Jackie told me.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.616
I wanna read the stick,
I wanna read the stick.

18:03.716 --> 18:04.517
Jeez, DJ.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.985
It's not like licking the spoon.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.189
Mom!

18:09.289 --> 18:10.757
All right, you can.

18:10.857 --> 18:11.958
Hold it, hold it,
hold it, though.

18:12.058 --> 18:12.859
Come here.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.828
Me No, I have something to say.

18:15.928 --> 18:20.467
All right, if this
test is positive,

18:20.567 --> 18:23.002
I expect all of your support.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.337
I'm not even going
to ask you for it.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.838
You're just going to give it.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.039
I know you can do it.

18:27.140 --> 18:31.378
You just pretend like
you're some other family.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.679
OK.

18:32.779 --> 18:33.580
Fine.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.947
Yep.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.916
All right, go.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.017
OK.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.352
DJ, tell us what it is.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.587
Pink is yes.

18:40.687 --> 18:41.988
White is no.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.756
- It's white.
- No way.

18:43.856 --> 18:44.657
Yes, yes, yes.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.627
Yes, yes, yes.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.497
Come on.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.498
I'm sorry, Roseanne.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.036
I'll talk to you later, sis.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.004
Thanks for coming by.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.672
Yeah, well, that's
what I do best.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.247
I'm going to go down to the
school and shoot some hoops.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.482
Mm-hmm, OK.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.983
So you'll be here
when I get back?

19:11.083 --> 19:12.852
Right.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.822
Uh, I didn't mean the
stuff I said before.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.358
You did.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.526
OK, I did.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.529
But, I'm sorry.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.963
OK?

19:24.063 --> 19:24.964
Mmm, OK.

19:41.147 --> 19:44.183
Dan, Becky wants
her driving lesson.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.084
Meet me in the car, Beck.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.923
DJ, did you eat
your breakfast, yet?

19:51.023 --> 19:51.824
OK.

19:54.227 --> 19:57.697
What would you have named it?

19:57.797 --> 20:00.099
Jack for a boy.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.634
And Priscilla for a girl.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.069
DJ: Mom!

20:03.169 --> 20:06.473
There's a whole new
box on the top shelf!

20:06.573 --> 20:10.377
DJ: I can't find it!

20:10.477 --> 20:11.611
Of course not.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.018
Well, you want
me to stick around?

20:19.118 --> 20:20.152
You want some company?

20:20.253 --> 20:21.087
Uh, no.

20:21.187 --> 20:21.988
I've got company.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.860
The Kids got your
face, Roseanne.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.398
I'm amazed every
time I look at him.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.299
Yeah.

20:35.302 --> 20:37.036
None of them look like me.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.738
That won't stand
up in court, Dan.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.640
Damn.

20:40.740 --> 20:44.944
I'm gonna go watch TV.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.846
[laughs] I'll clean it up.

20:46.946 --> 20:47.914
Yeah?

20:48.014 --> 20:48.815
All right.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.554
Becky.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.262
You know that thing
you were going to do,

21:03.363 --> 21:04.196
that tube-tying thing?

21:07.266 --> 21:08.067
I'm not gonna.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.473
Yeah, OK.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.274

21:22.582 --> 21:24.584

21:53.780 --> 21:56.115
