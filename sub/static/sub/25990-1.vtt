00:17.948 --> 00:21.297
Even serial killers live
next door to somebody.

00:26.233 --> 00:29.374
Tough pill to swallow,
I know, but it"s true.

00:36.450 --> 00:38.393
If I"ve learned anything,

00:38.417 --> 00:42.111
it"s that people hardly ever let
you know who they really are.

00:46.598 --> 00:49.922
Just past the manicured
lawns and friendly waves,

00:49.946 --> 00:54.789
inside any house, even
the one next door,

00:54.813 --> 00:58.230
anything could be happening
and you"d never know.

01:02.614 --> 01:04.661
And that"s the thing
about this place.

01:04.685 --> 01:08.009
It all might seem
normal and routine,

01:08.033 --> 01:12.451
but the truth is the suburbs are
where the craziest shit happens.

01:15.351 --> 01:18.078
You never know what might be
coming around the corner.

01:25.361 --> 01:26.993
Davey.

01:27.017 --> 01:28.616
Hey bud, what"s going on?

01:28.640 --> 01:30.169
Oh, hey Mr. Mackey.

01:30.193 --> 01:31.136
Hey.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.309
Oh, thank you.

01:32.333 --> 01:33.621
What"s with all the dirt?

01:33.645 --> 01:35.525
I"ve been doing a little
planting in the garden.

01:35.549 --> 01:37.389
Um, there was no cash in
your mailbox yesterday

01:37.413 --> 01:38.764
for the paper.

01:38.788 --> 01:39.908
Has it been a month already?

01:39.932 --> 01:40.490
Yeah.

01:40.514 --> 01:41.629
Jeez.

01:41.653 --> 01:42.630
Uh, ok.

01:42.654 --> 01:43.934
Well, actually I
was going to ask

01:43.958 --> 01:45.840
if you could help me
lift something inside

01:45.864 --> 01:47.255
if you have a second.

01:47.279 --> 01:47.980
I"ll get the money then.

01:48.004 --> 01:48.981
Two birds, one stone?

01:49.005 --> 01:50.189
Ok, sure.

01:50.213 --> 01:52.778
Great.

01:52.802 --> 01:54.493
After you.

02:10.406 --> 02:12.028
I knew I had it.

02:14.490 --> 02:15.490
There you go.

02:15.514 --> 02:17.516
Thank you.

02:19.035 --> 02:21.186
You got a big family, huh?

02:21.210 --> 02:23.533
Yeah, I guess so.

02:23.557 --> 02:26.052
Just uh, you know, make sure
you don"t live too close

02:26.076 --> 02:29.504
to them or they"ll come knocking
on your door every day.

02:29.528 --> 02:30.505
Alright, this is it.

02:30.529 --> 02:31.809
Some new furniture for upstairs,

02:31.833 --> 02:33.553
so I gotta get this hunk
of junk downstairs.

02:33.577 --> 02:34.700
Think we can manage it?

02:34.724 --> 02:35.510
Uh, yeah.

02:35.534 --> 02:36.880
Sure.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.411
Alright?

02:39.435 --> 02:40.308
Here we go.

02:40.332 --> 02:41.240
Ok.

02:41.264 --> 02:41.896
It is heavy.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.232
Yeah.

02:44.025 --> 02:45.372
Watch your step.

02:46.752 --> 02:48.098
Here, let me try that way.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.378
There we go.

02:56.774 --> 02:57.774
Woah!

02:57.798 --> 02:58.740
Jesus.

02:58.764 --> 02:59.362
You ok?

02:59.386 --> 03:00.190
Uh, yeah.

03:00.214 --> 03:00.880
Yeah, shit.

03:00.904 --> 03:01.536
Sorry.

03:01.560 --> 03:02.882
That"s ok.

03:02.906 --> 03:03.573
As long as it didn"t get
your foot or anything.

03:03.597 --> 03:04.539
You alright?

03:04.563 --> 03:06.023
Yeah.

03:06.047 --> 03:07.335
Why don"t we just take a break?

03:07.359 --> 03:08.602
Ok.

03:12.364 --> 03:13.790
Sorry about that.

03:13.814 --> 03:16.517
Damn water heater just keeps
getting louder and louder.

03:16.541 --> 03:18.277
Gotta get a new one.

03:18.301 --> 03:21.107
Flip side of not living
near any family is

03:21.131 --> 03:24.549
never anyone around
to lend a hand.

03:25.377 --> 03:28.553
Hey, I uh, I really appreciate
you helping me out.

03:29.830 --> 03:30.910
Uh, what"s in there?

03:30.934 --> 03:32.214
Well, that is where
we"re headed.

03:32.238 --> 03:33.878
Think you can make it
the rest of the way?

03:33.902 --> 03:35.497
Yeah.

03:38.287 --> 03:39.471
Heavy son of a bitch, huh?

03:39.495 --> 03:41.473
Yeah.

03:41.497 --> 03:45.270
I am putting the finishing
touches on my dark room.

03:45.294 --> 03:48.411
So I"m an amateur photographer.

03:48.435 --> 03:51.414
I figured that this piece
could store some equipment.

03:51.438 --> 03:53.174
Yeah, it"s cool.

03:53.198 --> 03:56.626
Um, I"m sort of an amateur
videographer, so I get it.

03:56.650 --> 03:59.939
Just like the old man.

03:59.963 --> 04:01.963
My god, I remember when
your parents would push you

04:01.987 --> 04:03.633
around the block
in the stroller.

04:03.657 --> 04:06.118
Now look at you.

04:06.142 --> 04:06.843
How old are you, anyway?

04:06.867 --> 04:07.775
15.

04:07.799 --> 04:09.294
15.

04:09.318 --> 04:10.950
That"s the perfect age.

04:10.974 --> 04:14.782
I wish I could just
freeze it for you.

04:14.806 --> 04:16.784
Uh, well, I gotta go.

04:16.808 --> 04:17.336
Yeah.

04:17.360 --> 04:17.853
Yeah.

04:17.878 --> 04:18.579
Of course.

04:18.603 --> 04:19.269
Go ahead.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.132
Thank you for this.

04:20.156 --> 04:21.029
I will, uh, take it from here.

04:21.053 --> 04:21.822
Give your family my best?

04:21.846 --> 04:23.366
I will.

04:31.167 --> 04:32.524
Manhunt!

04:32.548 --> 04:34.457
I am going to get you shitheads!

04:34.481 --> 04:36.379
I'm going to find you.

04:51.475 --> 04:52.475
Farraday?

04:52.499 --> 04:53.510
Find your own spot.

04:53.534 --> 04:54.200
You"re gonna get us both caught.

04:54.224 --> 04:55.305
This is my spot.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.030
Not anymore.

04:56.054 --> 04:57.342
Now go!

04:58.919 --> 05:00.828
Fine. Go.

05:00.852 --> 05:02.336
Jesus.

05:20.366 --> 05:21.366
Gotcha, dudes!

05:21.390 --> 05:22.574
Christ, guys!

05:22.598 --> 05:24.507
Hiding in Farraday"s spot, man?

05:24.531 --> 05:25.266
Lame.

05:25.290 --> 05:26.405
You"re better than that.

05:26.429 --> 05:28.718
Treehouse in 15, after
we catch this bitch?

05:28.742 --> 05:29.995
He"s close.

05:30.019 --> 05:32.100
I can practically smell
the Noxell on him.

05:45.034 --> 05:47.426
Vaginas are magical.

05:47.450 --> 05:49.773
I can"t wait to get laid.

05:49.797 --> 05:52.258
Aren"t you guys tired of
looking at those same chicks?

05:52.282 --> 05:53.605
Shit no, man.

05:53.629 --> 05:56.366
Or even just feel up a chick.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.678
Second base?

05:57.702 --> 05:59.024
That"s it?

05:59.048 --> 06:00.370
I rounded third once.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.716
She was hot, too.

06:01.740 --> 06:03.856
Oh, it just so happens to
be a chick none of us know.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.755
It was on vacation, dipshit.

06:05.779 --> 06:08.309
I"d just be happy to get
on any base with Nikki.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.931
In your dreams, Davey.

06:09.955 --> 06:11.761
Yeah, wet dreams.

06:11.785 --> 06:13.590
"How is she so frikken" hot?

06:13.614 --> 06:15.937
Too bad she"s into my brother.

06:15.961 --> 06:17.387
Kyle?

06:17.411 --> 06:18.768
No way.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.425
He"s like twenty and he
works at a hardware store.

06:20.449 --> 06:21.702
You think Kyle"s a dick?

06:21.726 --> 06:23.773
My asshole father wants
to tear this thing down.

06:23.797 --> 06:24.877
What?

06:24.901 --> 06:26.327
Ser-seriously?

06:26.351 --> 06:27.604
No, man.

06:27.628 --> 06:29.434
Can"t he at least wait
until we go to college?

06:29.458 --> 06:30.883
Eats, I need this place.

06:30.907 --> 06:32.885
Shit, I would live
up here if I could.

06:32.909 --> 06:35.094
I mean, I don"t know how
safe that would be.

06:35.118 --> 06:35.785
With the...

06:35.809 --> 06:36.441
What?

06:36.465 --> 06:37.442
Kids going missing.

06:37.466 --> 06:39.444
Ok, here we go.

06:39.468 --> 06:40.997
What?

06:41.021 --> 06:42.308
Come on.

06:42.332 --> 06:43.972
I mean, we all know
what you"re gonna say.

06:43.996 --> 06:44.897
It"s a conspiracy.

06:44.921 --> 06:46.243
It"s all connected.

06:46.267 --> 06:48.107
The missing kids aren"t
random, they"re part of

06:48.131 --> 06:52.422
some vast governmental
alien cover-up, right?

06:52.446 --> 06:55.356
So you don"t think it's weird?

06:55.380 --> 06:58.497
Look, last summer a kid
goes missing in Hazelton.

06:58.521 --> 07:01.490
Now another kid
disappears in Freeport?

07:04.596 --> 07:05.815
Uh, Davey, I love you man

07:05.839 --> 07:08.196
but uh, you do kinda
sound like a schitzoid.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.475
Remember when he connected a
Lite-Brite to his keyboard

07:10.499 --> 07:14.306
to try and communicate with
the extraterrestrials?

07:14.330 --> 07:16.570
Or when he swore there was a
demonic presence in his room

07:16.594 --> 07:18.883
because our houses were built
on Indian burial grounds?

07:19.887 --> 07:21.486
That was, like, three years ago.

07:21.510 --> 07:23.695
And our houses were built
on Indian burial grounds.

07:23.719 --> 07:25.628
Davey, there"s literally
no proof of that.

07:25.652 --> 07:26.491
Yes, there is.

07:26.515 --> 07:27.112
No, there"s not.

07:27.136 --> 07:28.285
Are we done here?

07:28.309 --> 07:29.989
I gotta beat off before
my parents get home

07:30.013 --> 07:31.150
and W.W. III breaks out.

07:31.174 --> 07:32.531
Good call.

07:32.555 --> 07:34.555
I"m gonna go make a withdrawal
from the spank bank.

07:34.579 --> 07:35.810
You guys are animals.

07:35.834 --> 07:38.009
Yes you are.

07:38.872 --> 07:40.356
Woah.

07:41.909 --> 07:44.269
Wait, I thought you were sick
of looking at the same chicks.

07:44.293 --> 07:45.371
I am.

07:45.395 --> 07:47.201
Why do you think I stopped
banging your mom?

07:47.225 --> 07:48.064
You are so dead.

07:48.088 --> 07:48.616
Oh yeah?

07:48.640 --> 07:49.824
Oh yeah?

07:49.848 --> 07:51.170
Give me the magazine.

07:51.194 --> 07:52.554
I"m pretty sure
this is non-lethal.

07:52.578 --> 07:54.822
This is my magazine!

08:15.460 --> 08:18.750
You should not read this
stuff before bedtime.

08:18.774 --> 08:19.820
Mom, I"m fifteen.

08:19.844 --> 08:20.993
Mmmhmm.

08:21.017 --> 08:22.457
You don"t have to
tuck me in anymore.

08:22.481 --> 08:23.927
Maybe you don"t need me to,

08:23.951 --> 08:27.517
doesn"t mean I'm
ready to give it up.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.692
You think dad"s
coming home soon?

08:29.716 --> 08:30.658
I don"t know, hon.

08:30.682 --> 08:32.004
You know how the news is.

08:32.028 --> 08:37.182
Always something going
on that needs reporting.

08:37.206 --> 08:39.448
Ok, sleep tight.

08:53.878 --> 08:57.789
Hey guys, Ipswich
Lanes tomorrow?

08:57.813 --> 08:58.790
Scope some cuties?

08:58.814 --> 09:00.274
I"m in.

09:00.298 --> 09:02.379
I hope that chick from
last week is there.

09:02.403 --> 09:04.140
She was all over me.

09:04.164 --> 09:05.313
You asked to touch her boobs

09:05.337 --> 09:06.697
and she threw you
over the railing.

09:06.721 --> 09:08.385
Bet I don"t look half
as dumb as Davey

09:08.409 --> 09:10.215
every time he sees
Nikki in the DJ booth

09:10.239 --> 09:12.251
and jizzes in his pants.

09:12.275 --> 09:14.046
Oh yeah?

09:14.070 --> 09:16.462
Well, I can see her right now.

09:16.486 --> 09:18.430
Naked.

09:18.454 --> 09:20.501
Bullshit.

09:20.525 --> 09:24.125
Dude, if you"re
serious, I hate you.

09:24.149 --> 09:27.059
Oh my god, she"s waving
for me to come over.

09:27.083 --> 09:29.337
Ok, now I know
you"re full of shit.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.122
Eats out.

09:31.812 --> 09:34.791
I"d easily trade both my
nuts to have the view.

09:34.815 --> 09:36.413
Ok, genius.

09:36.437 --> 09:38.477
If you"ve got no balls what's
the point of the view?

09:38.501 --> 09:40.262
You"d just be some
ball-less perv.

10:13.233 --> 10:14.659
Can you at least
make mom double-bag

10:14.683 --> 10:16.212
her meatloaf next time?

10:16.236 --> 10:18.110
It smells like werewolf crap.

10:18.134 --> 10:19.454
Well, if you would
have remembered

10:19.478 --> 10:21.398
to put the cinder blocks
back on the garbage cans

10:21.422 --> 10:25.773
like I told you we
wouldn"t have this mess.

10:25.797 --> 10:27.223
I hate raccoons.

10:27.247 --> 10:29.777
You should do an exclusive,
get pest control in here.

10:29.801 --> 10:30.985
I could film it.

10:31.009 --> 10:32.366
Camcorder"s off limits, pal.

10:32.390 --> 10:34.817
Station property, you know that.

10:34.841 --> 10:36.641
How am I supposed to
become the next Spielberg

10:36.665 --> 10:38.061
if I don"t practice?

10:38.085 --> 10:40.029
Nice try.

10:40.053 --> 10:41.573
Just uh, make sure
the driveway"s clean

10:41.597 --> 10:43.895
before you go anywhere.

10:43.919 --> 10:45.586
Capisce, Spielberg?

10:45.610 --> 10:48.313
Whatever.

11:43.576 --> 11:44.576
Guys.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.059
Guys.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.440
Dude, what?

11:46.464 --> 11:48.580
Those are the Pacific Grove
Babes from last week.

11:48.604 --> 11:50.271
Get off of me, you psycho!

11:50.295 --> 11:51.583
I can"t.

11:51.607 --> 11:53.989
I got needs, Woody.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.048
Nikki fucking Kazsuba.

12:08.072 --> 12:11.085
She"s, like, scientifically
the perfect woman.

12:11.109 --> 12:13.916
If she was my babysitter I"d
have been banging her the day

12:13.940 --> 12:15.158
my balls dropped.

12:15.182 --> 12:16.297
Yeah, was it hard
not to get a boner

12:16.321 --> 12:17.561
when she was giving you a bath?

12:17.585 --> 12:18.403
Jesus, guys.

12:18.427 --> 12:19.611
It was, like, four years ago.

12:19.635 --> 12:20.992
Not ten.

12:21.016 --> 12:23.132
We just played games and shit.

12:23.156 --> 12:24.927
What kinda games?

12:24.951 --> 12:25.824
Naughty games?

12:25.848 --> 12:27.826
I hate you guys so much.

12:32.544 --> 12:33.590
It is now confirmed

12:33.614 --> 12:35.178
that 14 Eastern Bloc countries,

12:35.202 --> 12:38.250
including the Soviet Union,
will boycott the Olympic games

12:38.274 --> 12:40.770
in Los Angeles
later this summer.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.914
Only Romania and Yugoslavia
will remain in attendance.

12:42.938 --> 12:44.463
Unbelievable.

12:44.487 --> 12:47.639
The Cold War"s never gonna end.

12:47.663 --> 12:49.848
Your future is dim, Davey.

12:49.872 --> 12:51.643
Ok.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.107
John dropped these
off for you today.

12:53.131 --> 12:55.340
It must be the fliers
for the Bay Festival.

12:58.156 --> 13:00.055
Mmmhmm.

13:01.711 --> 13:02.965
Oh.

13:02.989 --> 13:04.311
Come on.

13:04.335 --> 13:06.295
They got some crummy synth
band playing this year.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.970
Nikki"s not DJ-ing
like last year?

13:07.994 --> 13:09.281
She"s amazing.

13:09.305 --> 13:10.825
Well, with her parents
getting divorced

13:10.849 --> 13:12.733
it wasn"t really
in the cards, pal.

13:12.757 --> 13:14.839
Nikki"s parents are
getting divorced?

13:14.863 --> 13:16.461
Where did you hear that?

13:16.485 --> 13:17.842
Bob Burnqvist.

13:17.866 --> 13:19.188
He bowls with Mike Kaszuba.

13:19.212 --> 13:20.706
Apparently it"s pretty ugly,

13:20.730 --> 13:22.810
supposedly Mike"s not even
staying at home right now.

13:22.834 --> 13:25.539
Let"s not gossip, Randall.

13:25.563 --> 13:26.954
But that is awful.

13:26.978 --> 13:29.058
I never would have thought
they were having problems.

13:29.082 --> 13:31.153
That"s why they
invented curtains, hon.

13:55.006 --> 13:56.363
Hey, Randall, it"s Jimmy.

13:56.387 --> 13:58.710
Listen, uh, this is
going to sound crazy.

13:58.734 --> 14:00.534
The Chronicle received
a letter from some guy

14:00.558 --> 14:02.748
calling himself the
Cape May Slayer.

14:02.772 --> 14:05.096
This guy claims he"s killed
at least 13 teenaged boys

14:05.120 --> 14:06.442
over the last decade.

14:06.466 --> 14:07.581
Oh my god!

14:07.605 --> 14:09.548
Are you sure this isn"t a hoax?

14:09.572 --> 14:10.722
No, it's... it's legit, man.

14:10.746 --> 14:12.106
The story"s gonna
break any second.

14:12.130 --> 14:13.449
We need you in here pronto.

14:13.473 --> 14:15.544
I"m on my way.

14:20.204 --> 14:22.907
Guys, something big
is going down.

14:22.931 --> 14:24.529
Someone"s going down on who?

14:24.553 --> 14:25.944
No, I was right.

14:25.968 --> 14:27.118
You know those missing boys?

14:27.142 --> 14:28.913
It"s a serial killer.

14:28.937 --> 14:31.053
My dad just got called in.

14:31.077 --> 14:31.881
Holy shit!

14:31.905 --> 14:32.882
You"re not kidding.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.632
It"s on the news right now.

14:36.323 --> 14:38.750
This afternoon the
Cape May Chronicle

14:38.774 --> 14:41.235
received a letter
from an individual

14:41.259 --> 14:43.617
calling themselves
the Cape May Slayer,

14:43.641 --> 14:45.619
claiming responsibility for
the deaths of at least

14:45.643 --> 14:50.106
13 teenaged boys along
with two adults.

14:50.130 --> 14:53.316
The author also provided
a list of names, dates,

14:53.340 --> 14:56.078
and pertinent details
related to a number of

14:56.102 --> 14:58.804
open missing persons cases.

14:58.828 --> 15:01.807
We have confirmed the
accuracy of these statements.

15:01.831 --> 15:04.500
I can now officially
label this person

15:04.524 --> 15:07.330
as an active serial killer.

15:07.354 --> 15:09.781
The sheriff"s office reports
they're likely looking for

15:09.805 --> 15:13.336
a white male in his late
30"s to 40"s living alone.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.708
Preferred targets appear
to be males aged 12 to 16-

15:20.954 --> 15:22.345
I can"t believe
something like this

15:22.369 --> 15:24.106
Could actually happen here.

15:24.130 --> 15:25.624
It could be anyone.

15:25.648 --> 15:27.419
This is the coolest thing
that"s ever happened to us.

15:27.443 --> 15:29.111
Didn"t they say he
hunts guys our age?

15:29.135 --> 15:31.147
Should we cool it with
the late night manhunt?

15:31.171 --> 15:32.631
Why?

15:32.655 --> 15:34.775
None of the missing kids are
from Ipswich and Cape May

15:34.799 --> 15:35.945
"is pretty frikken" big.

15:35.969 --> 15:36.981
It"s not that big.

15:37.005 --> 15:37.982
What is it, nine towns?

15:38.006 --> 15:39.811
It"s ten towns.

15:39.835 --> 15:41.155
Guys, how are you
not freaking out

15:41.179 --> 15:43.815
that something"s finally
happening here?

15:43.839 --> 15:45.817
Because there"s no way
it"s gonna hit us.

15:45.841 --> 15:48.337
Or this neighbourhood.

15:48.361 --> 15:50.442
Dude, look at this place.

15:50.466 --> 15:52.203
You"re desperate for
crazy shit to happen.

15:52.227 --> 15:54.619
There"s a serial
killer on the loose.

15:54.643 --> 15:56.966
What else could possibly
be this exciting?

15:56.990 --> 15:59.555
Incoming titties, 12:00!

15:59.579 --> 16:01.236
Holy shit!

16:02.409 --> 16:03.559
Move over, Woody!

16:03.583 --> 16:05.664
Dude.

16:05.688 --> 16:08.736
If I was over there right
now she"d be pregnant.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.325
Show her a little respect, ok?

16:11.349 --> 16:14.397
Her parents are
getting divorced.

16:14.421 --> 16:17.849
Statistically, that means
she"s, like, 78 percent

16:17.873 --> 16:19.747
more likely to engage
in pre-marital sex.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.404
You guys are disgusting.

16:21.428 --> 16:22.474
Whatever, dude.

16:22.498 --> 16:23.544
You were thinking it.

16:23.568 --> 16:25.753
Bank it and spank it, boys.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.607
Please turn around, please.

16:30.092 --> 16:31.759
Shit! Get down!

16:31.783 --> 16:33.727
Dude!

16:33.751 --> 16:36.005
Fuck!

16:36.029 --> 16:37.720
Oh, I"m so fucked.

16:39.101 --> 16:43.599
Oh, Davey... you're...
you"re a really bad kisser.

16:43.623 --> 16:44.669
What?

16:44.693 --> 16:46.015
I"m-I'm sorry, Nikki, I-what?

16:46.039 --> 16:46.602
Guys!

16:46.626 --> 16:48.742
Cut the shit!

16:48.766 --> 16:51.572
Unlike you idiots I actually
come here to study.

16:51.596 --> 16:54.634
So don"t get me kicked out!

16:56.636 --> 16:57.889
Check it out.

16:57.913 --> 16:59.166
Cape May Slayer.

16:59.190 --> 17:01.548
Fifteen confirmed victims
and still counting.

17:01.572 --> 17:03.101
So rad.

17:03.125 --> 17:04.377
I don"t get it.

17:04.402 --> 17:06.162
Why would the killer
only write a letter now,

17:06.185 --> 17:07.554
after all this time?

17:07.578 --> 17:10.039
He"s been killing people and
getting away with it for years.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.800
He"s bored so he's
raising the stakes.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.068
He wasn"t counting on us.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.670
Jesus, Farraday, it"s not
like you"re gonna break it!

17:57.041 --> 17:58.041
Peek-a-boobs!

17:59.526 --> 18:01.183
Get it?

18:02.288 --> 18:04.093
What the hell are you doing?

18:04.117 --> 18:06.257
Free porn, bro.

18:08.535 --> 18:10.779
Is he just gonna take that?

18:34.389 --> 18:36.125
Yo, where the hell"s Sammy?

18:36.149 --> 18:37.816
We need him or we
don"t have numbers.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.163
I dunno.

18:39.187 --> 18:41.855
We haven"t heard from
him in a few days.

18:41.879 --> 18:43.960
"The Hoffmans" car's
in the driveway.

18:43.984 --> 18:45.307
They must be home.

18:45.331 --> 18:47.516
Let"s go get the little shit.

18:47.540 --> 18:50.174
Woody, stay with
these dickweeds.

18:50.198 --> 18:52.303
This way, dickweeds.

19:10.563 --> 19:11.747
No movement.

19:11.771 --> 19:13.231
Or lights.

19:13.255 --> 19:14.405
Oh well.

19:14.429 --> 19:16.165
Oh well?

19:16.189 --> 19:19.479
No one"s seen Sammy in days.

19:19.503 --> 19:20.100
What if-

19:20.124 --> 19:21.377
Don't even say it.

19:21.401 --> 19:23.103
He"s probably up at the
lake or some shit.

19:23.127 --> 19:26.589
Why is their car here?

19:26.613 --> 19:28.557
Maybe they rented one?

19:28.581 --> 19:29.316
Why would they-

19:29.340 --> 19:31.076
Who cares?

19:31.100 --> 19:32.980
Ok, the real issue is that
we don"t have numbers

19:33.004 --> 19:36.220
"cause of the little prick
so now I can"t play manhunt.

19:36.244 --> 19:38.142
Whatever, I"m out.

19:39.247 --> 19:42.560
Yeah, sorry Davey, I got
a book to finish anyway.

21:11.937 --> 21:12.937
Congrats.

21:12.961 --> 21:13.627
You"re getting your calcium.

21:13.651 --> 21:14.628
So what?

21:14.652 --> 21:17.321
Mackey is the Cape May Slayer.

21:17.345 --> 21:22.153
Uh... I knew we shouldn't have
taken you to the library, Davey.

21:22.177 --> 21:22.981
I blame myself.

21:23.005 --> 21:23.982
I also blame Farraday.

21:24.006 --> 21:25.018
No man, look.

21:25.042 --> 21:26.537
Who"s the missing ginger?

21:26.561 --> 21:28.281
That"s the kid I saw in
Mackey"s dining room

21:28.305 --> 21:29.298
a few weeks ago.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.482
When we were playing manhunt.

21:30.506 --> 21:31.276
Redheads all look the same.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.646
So true.

21:32.670 --> 21:34.630
Well, if you"re so sure
it's him why don"t you uh,

21:34.654 --> 21:35.994
just tell your parents?

21:36.018 --> 21:38.307
Because they"d never believe me.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.811
Guys, I was only,
like, ten feet away.

21:39.835 --> 21:41.345
I saw him clear as day.

21:41.369 --> 21:43.554
That"s him.

21:43.578 --> 21:45.452
Plus, what about the Hoffmans?

21:45.476 --> 21:47.351
Their lake house is only
a couple hours north,

21:47.375 --> 21:49.249
but their car"s still here?

21:49.273 --> 21:50.492
And they"re neighbours.

21:50.516 --> 21:51.700
So?

21:51.724 --> 21:53.805
What if one Hoffman saw
Mackey with Dusty?

21:53.829 --> 21:54.496
Who?

21:54.520 --> 21:55.566
The missing ginger.

21:55.590 --> 21:57.150
Mackey found out somehow
and killed them

21:57.174 --> 21:58.327
to get rid of the threat.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.018
Eats, tell them what Kyle said.

22:00.042 --> 22:01.226
Farraday, what the fuck?

22:01.250 --> 22:02.849
What did Kyle say?

22:02.873 --> 22:03.884
Goddammit.

22:03.908 --> 22:05.541
Fine.

22:05.565 --> 22:07.965
Um, he said that Mackey goes to
the hardware store every week

22:07.989 --> 22:09.683
and buys, like, 100
pounds of dirt,

22:09.707 --> 22:11.409
says it"s for his garden.

22:11.433 --> 22:12.479
Bullshit!

22:12.503 --> 22:14.378
Who uses 100 pounds
of dirt a week

22:14.402 --> 22:16.345
in a backyard garden?

22:16.369 --> 22:18.169
You know, he"s also got
a room in his basement

22:18.193 --> 22:19.555
with a padlock on the door.

22:19.579 --> 22:22.247
Why would he need that?

22:22.271 --> 22:24.595
Still not convinced?

22:24.619 --> 22:26.424
"Suspect is likely
a white male,"

22:26.448 --> 22:29.013
"late 30's to 40's,
lives alone."

22:29.037 --> 22:30.290
Who does that remind you of?

22:30.314 --> 22:33.431
Dude, Mackey"s a cop
with a sick reputation.

22:33.455 --> 22:36.020
That"s why it's so genius.

22:36.044 --> 22:37.401
He knows police tactics.

22:37.425 --> 22:40.024
He can plant evidence
to throw them off,

22:40.048 --> 22:42.371
or destroy it if they
ever find anything bad.

22:42.395 --> 22:43.786
And who would suspect a cop?

22:43.810 --> 22:46.410
It"s the perfect cover.

22:46.434 --> 22:48.135
Guys, if Mackey is
what I think he is

22:48.159 --> 22:49.689
then we gotta do something.

22:49.713 --> 22:51.518
Ok, Magnum P.I.

22:51.542 --> 22:53.727
What"s your plan?

22:53.751 --> 22:58.387
Well, we have to find out the
truth and be able to prove it.

22:58.411 --> 23:02.460
We need real, hard evidence.

23:02.484 --> 23:04.082
Which means...

23:04.106 --> 23:05.049
Stake-out?

23:05.073 --> 23:06.982
Search and destroy.

23:07.006 --> 23:08.915
Who"s with me?

23:08.939 --> 23:11.296
This is bat shit crazy.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.332
I"m in.

23:12.356 --> 23:16.118
Operation Mack
Attack starts now.

23:19.156 --> 23:23.412
He leaves his house every
weekday at 8:24 with a gym bag.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.369
Contents unknown.

23:27.475 --> 23:31.834
He gets home from work at
6:25 with that same bag.

23:31.858 --> 23:33.905
Goes in through the garage
and closes it behind him.

23:33.929 --> 23:35.759
He always closes it.

23:39.443 --> 23:40.843
His weekends are all
over the place.

23:40.867 --> 23:42.949
No patter.

23:42.973 --> 23:43.950
Except that he gardens.

23:43.974 --> 23:45.665
A lot.

23:46.321 --> 23:48.161
Acidity in the soil
must be off, though,

23:48.185 --> 23:50.359
plants look like shit.

23:56.504 --> 23:59.275
He has dinner alone every
night at 8:30-ish,

23:59.299 --> 24:01.968
then probably wanks it and
cries himself to sleep.

24:01.992 --> 24:03.970
Loser.

24:03.994 --> 24:06.662
Well, no, because most nights
he goes for a jog at 11:00

24:06.686 --> 24:08.940
for about an hour.

24:08.964 --> 24:10.148
Not sure where he goes

24:10.172 --> 24:12.623
but we should
definitely find out.

24:16.696 --> 24:19.330
Now that we know his schedule,
what do we do next?

24:19.354 --> 24:22.461
We catch this fucker
and become heroes.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.233
Farraday, you"re retarded.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.217
You think a bunch of glorified
Care Bears in hoods

24:28.241 --> 24:29.513
could take down the empire?

24:29.537 --> 24:31.687
They are aliens and they"re
highly intelligent!

24:31.711 --> 24:34.138
I mean, did you see how fast
that one learned to drive

24:34.162 --> 24:36.562
a speeder bike, and then ditch
it without even being spotted?

24:36.586 --> 24:37.659
Whatever, dude.

24:37.683 --> 24:38.867
They"re bears.

24:38.891 --> 24:40.869
Now, if it was Gremlins,
I"d buy it maybe.

24:40.893 --> 24:43.147
I"ve still gotta see Gremlins.

24:43.171 --> 24:45.356
Hey, maybe you
should take Nikki.

24:45.380 --> 24:48.359
She can find out what happens
if she gets your Mogwai wet.

24:48.383 --> 24:50.383
Farraday, stick to shit
that could actually happen.

24:50.407 --> 24:53.110
Like me fathering a
sibling for Woody.

24:54.216 --> 24:56.194
Dude, I told you to stop
talking about my mom.

24:56.218 --> 24:57.644
Would you rather I acted it out?

24:57.668 --> 24:59.548
No, I"d rather you just
not talk about anything-

24:59.572 --> 25:01.229
Shit, Mackey"s back!

25:18.551 --> 25:20.046
Let"s break into his garage.

25:20.070 --> 25:20.702
No.

25:20.726 --> 25:21.254
We can"t do that.

25:21.278 --> 25:21.910
He"s a cop.

25:21.934 --> 25:23.083
Hey guys.

25:23.107 --> 25:25.948
Look, at 11:00 he"s
gonna go for a run.

25:25.972 --> 25:28.250
Trust me, I"ve got a plan.

25:36.742 --> 25:38.295
Guys.

25:40.124 --> 25:41.585
What the hell are we doing?

25:41.609 --> 25:42.965
His fucking trash?

25:42.989 --> 25:44.588
Are you kidding me?

25:44.612 --> 25:45.623
What?

25:45.647 --> 25:47.127
Look, there could be
evidence in here.

25:47.151 --> 25:48.714
Fingers or bloody
rags or something.

25:48.738 --> 25:51.595
If we find anything, we got him.

25:51.619 --> 25:52.872
Do you know me at all?

25:52.896 --> 25:55.115
I am not digging through trash.

25:55.139 --> 25:56.220
Yeah, we"re gonna get
in a lot of trouble

25:56.244 --> 25:57.946
if we dig through
this on the street.

25:57.970 --> 26:00.500
Look, I"ve had to clean up
my driveway three times

26:00.524 --> 26:02.467
in the last two weeks
because of raccoons.

26:02.491 --> 26:04.780
That"s all anyone's gonna think.

26:04.804 --> 26:07.645
If I find a used
condom in there,

26:07.669 --> 26:10.361
I'm gonna be so jealous.

26:13.433 --> 26:14.445
You guys are crazy.

26:14.469 --> 26:15.308
Quit crying, Farraday.

26:15.332 --> 26:17.541
Oh my god.

26:19.785 --> 26:22.764
You know you can get AIDS from
looking through trash, right?

26:22.788 --> 26:24.593
The only way you"re
ever getting AIDS.

26:24.617 --> 26:25.629
I can"t believe it.

26:25.653 --> 26:27.631
Nothing.

26:27.655 --> 26:29.633
Maybe he doesn"t do
the killings here.

26:29.657 --> 26:32.670
He could have, uh, like
a lair or something.

26:32.694 --> 26:33.533
Somewhere.

26:33.557 --> 26:34.361
A lair?

26:34.385 --> 26:36.605
He"s Cobra Commander now?

26:36.629 --> 26:40.460
You know, we could always
look through his mail.

26:41.669 --> 26:43.153
For instance...

26:48.054 --> 26:50.367
Ask and you shall receive.

26:51.379 --> 26:52.379
Farraday"s right.

26:52.403 --> 26:53.643
We can check his mail every day

26:53.667 --> 26:55.969
and he"ll never suspect a thing.

26:55.993 --> 26:59.663
See what bills he"s getting,
people sending him stuff.

26:59.687 --> 27:02.137
I"ll take care of
that responsibility.

27:03.725 --> 27:05.323
Guys, look. It's after midnight.

27:05.347 --> 27:07.307
We should get out of here
before Mackey gets back.

27:07.331 --> 27:08.706
Try again tomorrow?

27:08.730 --> 27:10.984
Night one, no luck.

27:11.008 --> 27:12.734
Says you.

27:13.321 --> 27:15.368
Hey, Davey.

27:15.392 --> 27:18.336
Um, do you think maybe I
can sleep over tonight?

27:18.360 --> 27:19.786
I kinda don"t wanna be at home.

27:19.810 --> 27:21.029
Yeah, sure.

27:21.053 --> 27:23.790
We"ll make popcorn,
watch Close Encounters.

27:23.814 --> 27:24.688
Awesome.

27:24.712 --> 27:25.412
I"m gonna get my stuff.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.438
I"ll be over in a bit.

27:59.747 --> 28:02.059
Come on.

28:15.279 --> 28:18.455
I love you mom.

28:19.214 --> 28:21.907
You're so good.

28:49.486 --> 28:53.086
Dude, what took you so long?

28:53.110 --> 28:55.813
Expecting someone so late?

28:55.837 --> 28:58.840
Uh, no, no, just uh, Woody.

29:04.087 --> 29:05.754
Wow.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.963
I guess I haven"t
been here in a while.

29:07.987 --> 29:09.585
Your mom moved everything.

29:09.609 --> 29:10.483
Uh, yeah.

29:10.507 --> 29:13.096
Yeah, I guess, like a year ago.

29:30.665 --> 29:33.471
Where"d your folks
go all dressed up?

29:33.495 --> 29:35.704
Um, date night.

29:38.224 --> 29:39.743
Good.

29:59.418 --> 30:01.741
Huh.

30:01.765 --> 30:03.467
Better view of my
room than I thought.

30:03.491 --> 30:06.194
I"ve never seen you naked.

30:06.218 --> 30:07.989
That"s too bad.

30:08.013 --> 30:10.567
I"ve got a great body.

30:13.397 --> 30:15.720
Wow.

30:15.744 --> 30:18.033
When I gave you that first
journal I did not think

30:18.057 --> 30:20.577
it would lead to this.

30:22.027 --> 30:25.616
God, we used to
have so much fun.

30:28.067 --> 30:30.528
Sucks how much
things have changed.

30:30.552 --> 30:31.184
Uh, yeah.

30:31.208 --> 30:32.013
Yeah.

30:32.037 --> 30:33.877
Things have changed.

30:33.901 --> 30:36.534
You know, like good things.

30:36.558 --> 30:40.090
I think we"re old enough
to hang out together now.

30:40.114 --> 30:42.426
It"s too bad I'm leaving.

30:48.570 --> 30:49.720
Davey?

30:49.744 --> 30:50.755
We"re back.

30:50.779 --> 30:52.367
Fuck me.

30:59.029 --> 31:00.893
Sweet dreams.

31:09.937 --> 31:11.707
Thanks again for everything, Mrs.
S.

31:11.731 --> 31:13.088
Any time.

31:13.112 --> 31:14.538
Call when you get home so
we know you"re safe, ok?

31:14.562 --> 31:15.642
Yeah, it"s cool, I will.

31:15.666 --> 31:17.427
See you tomorrow.

32:39.543 --> 32:42.029
Get down, shit-for-brains!

32:45.319 --> 32:46.319
Woody, what"re you doing?

32:46.343 --> 32:47.113
You"re gonna lose him!

32:47.137 --> 32:48.011
Go!

32:48.035 --> 32:49.219
Christ, I"m freaking out, ok?

32:49.243 --> 32:51.014
My mom catches me,
I"m dead shit!

32:51.038 --> 32:52.670
Woody, relax.

32:52.694 --> 32:54.494
You said she was sleeping
off a 36 hour shift.

32:54.518 --> 32:55.678
She"s gonna be out for hours.

32:55.702 --> 32:57.158
Yeah, and you look
like you"re 30.

32:57.182 --> 32:58.021
It"s gonna be fine.

32:58.045 --> 32:59.332
Now, go.

32:59.356 --> 33:00.702
Hurry up.

33:02.049 --> 33:03.129
Keys...

33:03.153 --> 33:05.224
Oh my god.

33:18.375 --> 33:19.732
Hey, Woody.

33:19.756 --> 33:20.698
Where were you last night?

33:20.722 --> 33:22.321
I thought you were coming over?

33:22.345 --> 33:26.773
Yeah, um... sorry, my
mom needed my help.

33:26.797 --> 33:28.189
Oh.

33:28.213 --> 33:30.253
You"ll never guess who showed
up at my door instead.

33:31.457 --> 33:33.021
Nikki.

33:33.045 --> 33:34.436
No way.

33:34.460 --> 33:36.921
There is a parallel universe
with butt-fucking wookies

33:36.945 --> 33:38.785
where Nikki showed up at
your house last night.

33:38.809 --> 33:40.201
I"m serious!

33:40.225 --> 33:44.239
She was-she was about to kiss
me when my parents got home.

33:44.263 --> 33:45.102
Guys.

33:45.126 --> 33:46.576
Guys, Mackey"s coming out.

33:49.613 --> 33:51.419
We are picking up
this convo later.

33:51.443 --> 33:52.961
Yeah, ok.

34:03.627 --> 34:05.491
"Is that a fuckin" pick axe?

34:10.150 --> 34:12.083
Holy shit.

34:13.016 --> 34:14.672
That is a lot of dirt.

34:15.260 --> 34:17.100
Just like Kyle said.

34:17.123 --> 34:18.953
How many bodies do you
think that would bury?

34:26.960 --> 34:28.283
We gotta keep following him.

34:28.306 --> 34:29.688
Go.

34:54.138 --> 34:55.418
You drive like my grandma, dude.

34:55.442 --> 34:56.829
We"re gonna lose him.

34:56.853 --> 34:57.830
Shut it, Eats.

34:57.854 --> 34:58.693
Woody, look out!

34:58.717 --> 34:59.717
Woah!

35:00.144 --> 35:01.144
The hell, man?!

35:01.168 --> 35:03.007
Get off the road, you maniac!

35:03.031 --> 35:04.319
Great, now we lost him.

35:04.343 --> 35:05.355
Frick this, ok?

35:05.379 --> 35:06.183
I"m never doing this again.

35:06.207 --> 35:06.942
You guys are dicks!

35:06.966 --> 35:09.635
Guys, relax.

35:09.659 --> 35:11.459
Let"s just get home as
fast as we can and hope

35:11.483 --> 35:13.382
that"s where he's going, too.

35:30.921 --> 35:32.002
Oh, shit.

35:32.026 --> 35:33.210
Fuck.

35:33.234 --> 35:34.891
Fuuuuck.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.078
It"s a cop.

35:39.102 --> 35:40.355
It"s a cop.

35:40.379 --> 35:41.667
Dude, is that Mackey?

35:41.691 --> 35:42.806
Everybody just be cool.

35:42.830 --> 35:44.187
I don"t have my license, genius.

35:44.211 --> 35:45.451
Tell him you forgot it at home.

35:45.475 --> 35:46.672
How am I...

35:46.696 --> 35:48.329
What if it"s fucking Mackey?

35:48.353 --> 35:49.837
I"m so screwed.

36:11.962 --> 36:13.250
Oh shit, Officer Cole.

36:13.274 --> 36:16.702
Goddammit, Dale Woodworth,
I thought that was you.

36:16.726 --> 36:18.286
Does your mother know
you stole her car?

36:18.310 --> 36:19.222
No.

36:19.246 --> 36:20.566
We, uh, we were
just borrowing it.

36:20.590 --> 36:22.777
We ran out of snacks and
she was asleep so I just-

36:22.801 --> 36:24.917
What if it wasn"t me
that pulled you over?

36:24.941 --> 36:27.057
You could be in
some real trouble.

36:27.081 --> 36:28.507
I know, I"m so sorry.

36:28.531 --> 36:30.233
I won"t do it again.

36:30.257 --> 36:33.788
You got me in quite a bind.

36:33.812 --> 36:34.927
I just can"t bust you

36:34.951 --> 36:35.928
because "cause then
how am I gonna look"

36:35.952 --> 36:37.274
your mother in the
eye at church?

36:37.298 --> 36:39.231
I know, I understand.

36:42.407 --> 36:44.557
Mr. Eaton.

36:44.581 --> 36:45.903
What a surprise.

36:45.927 --> 36:47.974
Officer Cole.

36:47.998 --> 36:49.759
We meet again.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.600
Look, guys.

36:52.624 --> 36:54.774
Another kid has gone missing.

36:54.798 --> 36:56.358
Everybody up at town
hall is in a panic.

36:56.382 --> 36:58.571
They"ve been talking about
canceling the Bay Festival.

36:58.595 --> 37:03.921
Get your asses home where
it"s safe and stay there.

37:03.945 --> 37:05.440
You got it?

37:05.464 --> 37:06.096
Yes sir.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.235
Yes.

37:07.259 --> 37:08.571
Straight home.

37:34.194 --> 37:35.194
Guys, shit.

37:35.218 --> 37:37.127
He switched cars.

37:37.151 --> 37:37.921
Who cares?

37:37.945 --> 37:38.853
Where"s the dirt?

37:38.877 --> 37:39.923
That"s what I mean.

37:39.947 --> 37:41.683
He doesn"t have it.

37:41.707 --> 37:44.859
It must still be in his cruiser.

37:44.883 --> 37:47.230
Unless he stashed it some place.

37:53.512 --> 37:55.134
We"re onto you, Mackey.

38:11.703 --> 38:15.372
I thought everything was fine.

38:15.396 --> 38:17.443
And then they just...

38:17.467 --> 38:22.966
sat me down and told me they
don"t love each other anymore.

38:22.990 --> 38:25.520
They didn"t even seem upset.

38:25.544 --> 38:27.374
So fucked up.

38:29.652 --> 38:33.459
I just feel like my life
has been one big lie

38:33.483 --> 38:37.325
and I can"t even talk
to anyone about it.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.464
What about your friends?

38:38.488 --> 38:40.224
Especially my friends.

38:40.248 --> 38:43.227
All their parents are
still happily married.

38:43.251 --> 38:45.091
Whatever that means.

38:45.115 --> 38:47.680
Well, you don"t know that.

38:47.704 --> 38:51.408
Who knows what really goes
on behind closed doors?

38:51.432 --> 38:55.550
People will keep stuff
like that private.

38:55.574 --> 38:58.553
Are your parents happy?

38:58.577 --> 39:02.005
I don"t know, I guess.

39:02.029 --> 39:07.390
Honestly, I can"t wait to get
out of this stupid town.

39:07.414 --> 39:09.737
God, you must think
I"m such an idiot,

39:09.761 --> 39:12.291
bringing you out here for this.

39:12.315 --> 39:14.041
No way, never.

39:17.596 --> 39:19.954
Can I tell you my secret?

39:19.978 --> 39:23.129
Mmmhmm.

39:23.153 --> 39:26.512
I think Mackey is the
Cape May Slayer.

39:26.536 --> 39:29.204
Mr. Mackey?

39:29.228 --> 39:31.414
Davey, he"s friends with my dad.

39:31.438 --> 39:33.416
Yeah, that"s what he
wants you to think.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.418
They go fishing.

39:35.442 --> 39:37.972
Look, I know how
your brain works.

39:37.996 --> 39:39.283
But you"re wrong.

39:39.307 --> 39:41.803
No, look, this is different, ok?

39:41.827 --> 39:43.080
We"ve been spying on him and-

39:43.104 --> 39:44.081
What?

39:44.105 --> 39:45.462
Davey, he"s a cop.

39:45.486 --> 39:47.526
If your mom and dad found
out you were spying on him

39:47.550 --> 39:48.741
they would flip their shit.

39:48.765 --> 39:52.296
I know, that"s why they"re
not gonna find out.

39:52.320 --> 39:55.127
At least not until we
have solid evidence.

39:55.151 --> 39:56.887
Listen to me.

39:56.911 --> 39:59.545
You gotta stop.

39:59.569 --> 40:01.616
I"m not gonna get caught.

40:01.640 --> 40:05.586
Davey, just let the
cops deal with this.

40:05.610 --> 40:08.658
I don"t want anything
bad to happen to you.

40:08.682 --> 40:12.593
You"re like the only person left
in this town I actually like.

40:12.617 --> 40:14.353
Really?

40:14.377 --> 40:15.492
What about Kyle?

40:15.516 --> 40:16.942
What about Kyle?

40:16.966 --> 40:19.417
He"s twenty and he works
at the hardware store.

40:37.365 --> 40:39.033
Hey, uh, who wants
a freezie pop?

40:39.057 --> 40:41.231
Nice and cold,
come and get "em!"

40:44.165 --> 40:46.696
One for each of
you, there you go.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.860
Enjoy.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.036
Oh!

41:17.060 --> 41:18.969
Snagged it from my dad"s stash.

41:18.993 --> 41:21.178
Finally using those
brain powers for good.

41:21.202 --> 41:22.041
About damn time.

41:22.065 --> 41:23.826
Give it.

41:27.381 --> 41:28.381
Oh.

41:28.877 --> 41:29.877
It"s bad.

41:29.901 --> 41:31.074
It"s so bad.

41:35.354 --> 41:36.754
It tastes like my
mouth is bleeding.

41:36.778 --> 41:38.193
Let me try it.

41:40.290 --> 41:41.290
Oh.

41:42.534 --> 41:44.467
Guess you dickheads
just aren"t men yet.

41:48.713 --> 41:52.900
So, what"s the deal
with you and Nikki?

41:52.924 --> 41:57.007
Well, we hung out
again last night.

41:57.031 --> 41:57.905
Oooh, Davey.

41:57.929 --> 41:59.251
No way.

41:59.275 --> 42:02.219
We have, like-no, we have,
like, a connection.

42:02.243 --> 42:03.945
A connection?

42:03.969 --> 42:05.706
Any connection I want
with her is vaginal.

42:05.730 --> 42:06.707
Oral if she"s into it.

42:06.731 --> 42:09.630
Don"t talk about her like that.

42:12.391 --> 42:14.635
Mackey"s still out there.

42:15.981 --> 42:19.582
Look, Davey, we"ve
been on him for weeks.

42:19.606 --> 42:21.086
I mean, if he was
gonna give us a clue

42:21.110 --> 42:23.803
we"d have seen it by
now, don"t you think?

42:26.613 --> 42:29.236
Not if they missed
it the first time.

42:46.494 --> 42:47.782
What?

42:47.806 --> 42:51.337
Everyone keeps their doors
unlocked around here.

42:51.361 --> 42:54.064
Well, yeah, but this
was locked last time.

42:54.088 --> 42:55.100
We gotta go in.

42:55.124 --> 42:56.324
What if they"re dead in there?

42:56.348 --> 42:58.103
You said he killed
kids, not adults.

42:58.127 --> 42:59.725
That"s not totally true.

42:59.749 --> 43:01.669
One of the articles at the
library said he killed

43:01.693 --> 43:03.626
a whole family at Pacific Grove.

43:03.650 --> 43:05.455
They said something
must have gone wrong.

43:05.479 --> 43:06.421
And if it"s Mackey?

43:06.445 --> 43:07.940
Fuck that.

43:07.964 --> 43:09.977
I mean, you wanna go
in there, be my guest.

43:10.001 --> 43:12.279
Dumbasses first.

43:13.832 --> 43:16.179
Davey, I was kidding.

43:17.664 --> 43:20.770
I"ve got a bad
feeling about this.

43:24.567 --> 43:26.534
The light doesn"t work.

43:35.060 --> 43:37.487
You guys smell that?

43:37.511 --> 43:38.522
Yeah.

43:38.546 --> 43:42.699
It smells like... roadkill.

43:42.723 --> 43:43.923
If there"s dead bodies in here

43:43.947 --> 43:45.303
I"m totally gonna
shit my Calvins.

43:45.327 --> 43:47.245
Oh...

44:03.848 --> 44:06.574
You guys still think I"m crazy?

44:24.765 --> 44:26.847
Woah, dude. Check your Calvins.

44:26.871 --> 44:28.193
Guys, shut up!

44:28.217 --> 44:29.194
Ok?

44:29.218 --> 44:31.254
He could still be in the house.

44:32.255 --> 44:34.844
Hey, Woody, try the
kitchen light.

44:49.410 --> 44:51.043
Motherfuckers!

44:51.067 --> 44:52.587
Oh, you guys scared
the crap out of me!

44:52.611 --> 44:53.563
We scared you?!

44:53.587 --> 44:55.116
I nearly had a goddamn
heart attack!

44:55.140 --> 44:56.186
What"re you doing here?

44:56.210 --> 44:57.360
With the lights off?

44:57.384 --> 44:59.465
I blew a fuse vacuuming
up this mess.

44:59.489 --> 45:00.743
Stupid cats.

45:00.767 --> 45:02.434
Why are you cleaning
up after their cats?

45:02.458 --> 45:04.938
They rented an RV and went up to
the lake house for the summer.

45:04.962 --> 45:07.025
They pay me to make sure
their cats don"t die.

45:07.049 --> 45:08.647
It"s easy money, usually.

45:08.671 --> 45:09.752
You wanna explain to me

45:09.776 --> 45:12.651
what the hell you
guys are doing here?

45:12.675 --> 45:17.725
Um... well, Sammy was
missing so we thought

45:17.749 --> 45:20.970
maybe the Hoffmans were dead.

45:20.994 --> 45:21.867
And let me guess.

45:21.891 --> 45:24.628
You thought it was Mr. Mackey.

45:24.652 --> 45:26.320
Seriously?

45:26.344 --> 45:30.738
Wait, you were really
talking to her?

45:30.762 --> 45:33.430
Ok, what"s going on here?

45:33.454 --> 45:36.675
You guys hooking up?

45:36.699 --> 45:42.291
Let"s just say he's more of
a man than you jerk-offs.

45:45.639 --> 45:47.444
Oooh!

45:47.468 --> 45:50.333
Davey, you are my God!

45:51.956 --> 45:53.278
Oh, man.

45:53.302 --> 45:55.718
Can I get a picture
of you for my shrine?

45:57.608 --> 45:59.008
And don"t forget to
clean your room.

45:59.032 --> 45:59.974
I mean it.

45:59.998 --> 46:01.769
I know, mom.

46:01.793 --> 46:03.691
God.

46:12.839 --> 46:15.645
Hey guys, what time are we
playing manhunt tonight?

46:15.669 --> 46:17.671
I got an idea.

46:26.853 --> 46:28.658
Alright, here"s the plan.

46:28.682 --> 46:30.625
No way, you still have those?

46:30.649 --> 46:32.386
While you guys are
spying we"re gonna plant

46:32.410 --> 46:34.560
one of these outside
Mackey"s bedroom window.

46:34.584 --> 46:35.944
We can use the other
one to listen.

46:35.968 --> 46:36.839
Audio surveillance.

46:36.863 --> 46:37.874
Smart.

46:37.898 --> 46:39.462
Let"s just not get caught, ok?

46:39.486 --> 46:43.535
If Mackey spots you just act
like it"s part of the game.

46:43.559 --> 46:45.123
Now, we probably have
like two minutes

46:45.147 --> 46:47.401
"til those little shits are
up our asses with flashlights

46:47.425 --> 46:48.712
so let"s be quick, ok?

46:48.736 --> 46:51.129
Farraday, Eats, you guys
take the back yard.

46:51.153 --> 46:53.579
Me and Woody will
plant the walkie.

46:53.603 --> 46:55.409
Operation Manhunt starts now.

46:55.433 --> 46:57.193
Let"s go.

47:01.888 --> 47:03.175
Hurry up!

47:03.199 --> 47:05.201
Come on.

47:16.419 --> 47:18.225
Who"s got eyes on him?

47:18.249 --> 47:19.053
I got him.

47:19.077 --> 47:19.882
He"s in the living room.

47:19.906 --> 47:20.779
Over.

47:20.803 --> 47:22.563
Let"s go.

47:34.265 --> 47:36.105
Found you, you bit
tittied butthole!

47:36.129 --> 47:37.278
Nu-uh, we had time out.

47:37.302 --> 47:38.693
No you don"t, I caught you.

47:38.717 --> 47:40.637
Why don"t you shut the
fuck up and get outta here

47:40.661 --> 47:42.387
before I pound you,
you little shit?

47:42.411 --> 47:43.284
Whatever, pussy.

47:43.308 --> 47:44.354
You two are out.

47:44.378 --> 47:46.046
Ha!

47:46.070 --> 47:47.426
"I freakin" hate that kid.

47:47.450 --> 47:49.187
I"ve got him.

47:49.211 --> 47:50.360
Holy fuck.

47:50.384 --> 47:51.706
Guys, he"s wearing rubber gloves

47:51.730 --> 47:54.123
and he"s got a bucket
of cleaning shit.

47:54.147 --> 47:56.539
What?

47:56.563 --> 47:58.230
Wait, what do you mean?

47:58.254 --> 48:00.232
Farraday, he"s coming your way.

48:00.256 --> 48:01.751
What"s in the bucket?

48:01.775 --> 48:04.616
It looks like bleach,
a scrubbing brush,

48:04.640 --> 48:07.274
and I can"t tell
what the rest is.

48:07.298 --> 48:09.966
Holy shit, he"s
got blood on him!

48:09.990 --> 48:11.819
What? Are you sure?

48:13.660 --> 48:14.660
I- I don"t know.

48:14.684 --> 48:15.627
It could be paint.

48:15.651 --> 48:18.147
It"s on his shirt.

48:18.171 --> 48:19.217
Shit.

48:19.241 --> 48:21.484
He went into the basement.

48:25.868 --> 48:28.260
What the hell?

48:28.284 --> 48:30.504
All his basement windows
are painted over.

48:30.528 --> 48:32.126
Mackey"s M.I.A.

48:32.150 --> 48:33.817
Who"s watching the
basement door?

48:33.841 --> 48:35.429
Hey, let me down.

48:39.686 --> 48:40.686
Alright, stay here.

48:40.710 --> 48:42.540
Watch ok?

48:44.197 --> 48:45.612
Shit!

48:53.344 --> 48:55.425
Do you think he"s onto us?

48:55.449 --> 48:56.771
I don"t think so.

48:56.795 --> 48:59.982
As far as he knows we were
just playing manhunt.

49:00.006 --> 49:01.949
Stupid G.I. Joe
walkie"s not working.

49:01.973 --> 49:03.493
Well, you taped the
button down, right?

49:03.517 --> 49:04.494
Of course I did.

49:04.518 --> 49:06.816
And the batteries are brand new.

49:06.840 --> 49:08.335
It might be the distance then.

49:08.359 --> 49:09.612
Those things were junk.

49:09.636 --> 49:11.614
That"s why we upgraded.

49:11.638 --> 49:13.758
Are you just gonna say frick
it and leave it up there?

49:13.782 --> 49:14.651
No way.

49:14.675 --> 49:16.401
I gotta make it work.

49:41.081 --> 49:42.231
Davey.

49:42.255 --> 49:43.680
Hey.

49:43.704 --> 49:46.545
I gotta say, you scared the
hell out of me last night.

49:46.569 --> 49:49.169
Uh, yeah, yeah, we were
um, sorry about that.

49:49.193 --> 49:51.412
Just... we were just
playing manhunt

49:51.436 --> 49:53.828
and I didn"t expect you there.

49:53.852 --> 49:55.175
No, I get it.

49:55.199 --> 49:57.039
There"s a lot of good
hiding spots for manhunt.

49:57.063 --> 50:00.697
Yeah, your yard "s full of" em.

50:00.721 --> 50:02.521
Guess you didn"t see me
coming either, though.

50:04.863 --> 50:05.875
So what"s up?

50:05.899 --> 50:09.016
Wait, let me guess.

50:09.040 --> 50:10.431
I owe you money.

50:10.455 --> 50:11.743
Uh, yeah.

50:11.767 --> 50:13.020
I"m ready for you this time.

50:13.044 --> 50:14.735
Come on back.

50:34.077 --> 50:35.077
There you go.

50:35.101 --> 50:36.595
Thanks.

50:36.619 --> 50:39.046
Hey, you uh... you're not using
those things for manhunt,

50:39.070 --> 50:40.082
are you?

50:40.106 --> 50:41.386
I mean, if you want real walkies

50:41.410 --> 50:42.801
I got a couple that are
retired from the force.

50:42.825 --> 50:43.740
They"re inside.

50:43.764 --> 50:45.121
They"re just gathering dust.

50:45.145 --> 50:46.605
You can come in and take a
look at them if you want.

50:46.629 --> 50:47.744
They pick up everything.

50:47.768 --> 50:49.436
I- I can"t right now.

50:49.460 --> 50:50.954
Gotta get back to my route.

50:50.978 --> 50:51.783
Alright.

50:51.807 --> 50:52.715
Thanks for the offer.

50:52.739 --> 50:54.741
Yep.

51:00.643 --> 51:02.380
Uh, sorry.

51:02.404 --> 51:04.278
Um, I guess they are
pretty crappy, huh?

51:04.302 --> 51:06.422
Well, the offer stands if you
ever want the real deal.

51:06.446 --> 51:08.379
Just come on by any time.

51:30.466 --> 51:31.788
Oh, shit!

51:45.619 --> 51:47.010
Oh, fuck.

51:47.034 --> 51:48.967
Fuck.

51:51.798 --> 51:52.809
Guys, guys, come in.

51:52.833 --> 51:54.801
I"m freaking the fuck out.

51:55.802 --> 51:57.002
Dude, it"s 1:00 in the morning.

51:57.026 --> 51:58.608
You"re gonna wake up my mom.

51:58.632 --> 52:00.300
Not after the pounding
I just gave her.

52:00.324 --> 52:03.372
I"m serious!

52:03.396 --> 52:07.272
Emergency meeting,
treehouse, now.

52:07.296 --> 52:09.136
"The friggen" walkie was
sitting in his window.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.620
He wanted me to see it.

52:10.644 --> 52:12.450
Oh my god, he"s onto us.

52:12.474 --> 52:14.866
Oh, I should have just
gone to space camp.

52:14.890 --> 52:16.730
There"s no way he knows
why we"re spying on him

52:16.754 --> 52:19.457
and even if he does
he"s only onto me,

52:19.481 --> 52:21.493
which is why I
need you guys now.

52:21.517 --> 52:23.875
When Mackey heads out
for his 11:00 jog,

52:23.899 --> 52:26.015
Farraday and Woody,
you"re gonna follow him.

52:26.039 --> 52:27.879
I don"t like where
this is going.

52:27.903 --> 52:29.984
Yesterday on my route I
saw Mackey dumping dirt

52:30.008 --> 52:31.676
over something in his garden.

52:31.700 --> 52:33.885
Something the size of a body.

52:33.909 --> 52:37.337
While you two follow Mackey,
we"re gonna tear up his garden.

52:37.361 --> 52:39.546
See if we can find that body.

52:39.570 --> 52:41.030
What if Mackey catches us?

52:41.054 --> 52:42.307
That"s not gonna happen.

52:42.331 --> 52:44.516
That"s why I had you
grab Kyle"s CB's.

52:44.540 --> 52:45.931
If Mackey starts heading back,

52:45.955 --> 52:48.348
Woody and Farraday will
radio to let us know.

52:48.372 --> 52:49.659
What about the garden?

52:49.683 --> 52:51.403
He"s gonna notice his
plants are all dug up.

52:51.427 --> 52:52.317
Raccoons.

52:52.341 --> 52:53.939
Just like the garbage
in the street.

52:53.963 --> 52:55.769
Just wait for him to leave.

52:55.793 --> 52:58.116
And stay in touch with
our CB"s the whole time.

52:58.140 --> 53:00.601
It's... it's foolproof.

53:00.625 --> 53:03.352
Look, we need that evidence.

53:18.954 --> 53:20.621
We gotta get closer.

53:20.645 --> 53:23.141
How the hell are we gonna do
that without him noticing us?

53:23.165 --> 53:24.694
We?

53:24.718 --> 53:27.041
I"m not going by myself.

53:27.065 --> 53:29.112
What are you, chicken?

53:29.136 --> 53:30.804
Oh, nice try.

53:30.828 --> 53:32.978
What if I told Eats about
that Hustler magazine

53:33.002 --> 53:35.533
we have that you stole?

53:35.557 --> 53:38.422
Goddammit, Farraday.

53:56.025 --> 53:57.579
Noah?

54:03.516 --> 54:05.010
Oh...

54:32.441 --> 54:34.201
Hello?

54:34.961 --> 54:36.825
Someone there?

55:04.059 --> 55:08.695
"That was way to friggen" close.

55:08.719 --> 55:09.799
Shit!

55:09.823 --> 55:12.239
What if he"s going to his house?

55:14.380 --> 55:15.840
Guys, we lost Mackey.

55:15.864 --> 55:18.325
I repeat, we lost Mackey.

55:18.349 --> 55:20.351
Do you copy?

55:21.985 --> 55:22.985
Fuck, Davey.

55:23.009 --> 55:24.573
There"s nothing here.

55:24.597 --> 55:26.771
No, we"re just not
digging deep enough.

55:28.670 --> 55:30.820
Maybe he"s hiding
something in there.

55:30.844 --> 55:32.881
What?

55:41.234 --> 55:43.961
I can"t see anything.

55:51.796 --> 55:53.729
I got this.

55:56.076 --> 55:57.940
What"re you doing?

56:03.256 --> 56:05.096
How the hell"d you do that?

56:05.120 --> 56:07.029
I"m just good at
working the hole.

56:07.053 --> 56:08.858
Seriously, how"d you do that?

56:08.882 --> 56:11.861
Honestly, you just jiggle
it a bunch, work it around,

56:11.885 --> 56:13.285
and it"ll pop open
most of the time.

56:13.309 --> 56:15.208
It"s easy.

56:26.141 --> 56:27.901
Unless he"s killing
people with his lawnmower

56:27.925 --> 56:31.860
we got jack shit.

56:52.270 --> 56:55.457
Well, this whole night"s
been a waste of time.

56:55.481 --> 56:58.321
Until now.

56:58.345 --> 57:00.013
This is Dusty Dewitt"s shirt.

57:00.037 --> 57:00.841
Who?

57:00.865 --> 57:02.695
Oh, the ginger?

57:03.696 --> 57:04.845
Shit.

57:04.869 --> 57:07.192
That"s blood.

57:07.216 --> 57:09.022
Hey, what"re you guys
doing in there?!

57:10.012 --> 57:11.680
You got a death wish?

57:11.704 --> 57:12.922
Us?

57:12.946 --> 57:13.613
We"ve been trying to
call you on the CB

57:13.637 --> 57:15.511
for like 10 minutes.

57:15.535 --> 57:16.650
We lost him.

57:16.674 --> 57:18.100
We don"t have a
clue where he went.

57:18.124 --> 57:19.481
We need to go, now.

57:19.505 --> 57:23.105
And Davey, you"re not gonna
believe what we found.

57:23.129 --> 57:24.762
Neither are you guys.

57:24.786 --> 57:27.064
Come on.

57:27.651 --> 57:29.974
He keeps a car in
a storage unit?

57:29.998 --> 57:31.941
And like a million
bags of dirt, too.

57:31.965 --> 57:33.771
Plus, shovels and a pick axe.

57:33.795 --> 57:35.358
Why would anyone need all that?

57:35.382 --> 57:37.382
It"s the same reason he's
got Dusty Dewitt"s shirt.

57:37.406 --> 57:39.777
He killed him and buried
the body somewhere.

57:39.801 --> 57:42.400
And there was like a bunch of
bags of um, something else.

57:42.424 --> 57:43.784
They had like
chemical signs on it.

57:43.808 --> 57:45.403
It looks hazardous.

57:45.427 --> 57:46.128
It said Noah.

57:46.152 --> 57:47.232
Noah was on the bag.

57:47.256 --> 57:47.992
Noah?

57:48.016 --> 57:48.820
What the hell"s that?

57:48.844 --> 57:50.028
How am I supposed to know?

57:50.052 --> 57:52.306
I just know it was like
spelled kinda weird.

57:52.330 --> 57:53.987
Here, hand me that.

58:05.689 --> 58:07.218
Classic Woody.

58:07.242 --> 58:08.564
What?

58:08.588 --> 58:10.487
This look right?

58:12.212 --> 58:13.569
Yeah, that"s the same thing.

58:13.593 --> 58:17.262
No, what you wrote means
absolutely nothing.

58:17.286 --> 58:21.888
What I wrote is the chemical
formula for sodium hydroxide.

58:21.912 --> 58:22.854
Congrats, Woody.

58:22.878 --> 58:23.993
You"re retarded.

58:24.017 --> 58:25.374
Shove it, Eats.

58:25.398 --> 58:26.409
Stop.

58:26.433 --> 58:28.170
What the hell"s
sodium hydroxide?

58:28.194 --> 58:32.208
I don"t know, but I do know
that it"s not used in gardening

58:32.232 --> 58:35.201
"cause I"m pretty sure
it"d be toxic to plants.

58:45.291 --> 58:46.291
Holy shit.

58:46.315 --> 58:47.879
Guys, look at this.

58:47.903 --> 58:50.848
Sodium hydroxide breaks
down the chemical bonds

58:50.872 --> 58:55.922
that keep flesh intact, turning
organic tissue to liquid.

58:55.946 --> 59:00.720
Frequently used to decompose
roadkill dumped in landfills.

59:00.744 --> 59:04.689
This will reduce the
odour of decomposition.

59:04.713 --> 59:06.713
This sicko"s using this
stuff to cover up the smell

59:06.737 --> 59:12.041
from the dead bodies
he"s dumping some place.

59:12.065 --> 59:14.492
I got good news for you, Woody.

59:14.516 --> 59:17.484
It"s time to tell my parents.

59:25.734 --> 59:31.233
Mackey.

59:31.257 --> 59:33.994
He"s a cop, for Christ's sake.

59:34.018 --> 59:36.018
He"s been our neighbour
since before you were born.

59:36.042 --> 59:38.620
Dad, every serial killer
is somebody"s neighbour-

59:38.644 --> 59:39.966
That milk carton.

59:39.990 --> 59:43.590
That t-shit and
the storage unit?

59:43.614 --> 59:45.730
That-that doesn"t
prove anything, guys.

59:45.754 --> 59:47.234
How could you guys
go along with this?

59:47.258 --> 59:49.458
We wouldn"t have if it
didn't make so much sense.

59:49.482 --> 59:51.122
Yeah, and then when we
were following him-

59:51.146 --> 59:52.668
Jesus, you have
been spying on him?

59:52.692 --> 59:54.187
Yeah, we had to!

59:54.211 --> 59:57.086
And the more we watched, the
more the details stack up.

59:57.110 --> 59:58.950
He goes jogging at
11:00 at night.

59:58.974 --> 01:00:00.987
He buys a ton of
dirt every week.

01:00:01.011 --> 01:00:03.852
He keeps a spare car
in a storage unit.

01:00:03.876 --> 01:00:05.543
Why would he do that?

01:00:05.567 --> 01:00:07.487
There was nothing in his
garden when we dug it up

01:00:07.511 --> 01:00:08.178
but I"m-

01:00:08.202 --> 01:00:09.547
You dug up his garden?

01:00:09.571 --> 01:00:11.376
Oh, goddammit, David.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.447
You guys are in
deep, deep trouble.

01:00:13.471 --> 01:00:16.278
I mean, it"s vandalism,
spying, stealing.

01:00:16.302 --> 01:00:17.762
I mean, it"s unacceptable, boys.

01:00:17.786 --> 01:00:18.763
We"re trying to save people.

01:00:18.787 --> 01:00:20.582
Yeah, well, you"re not.

01:00:24.379 --> 01:00:26.150
Alright, we"re gonna go
over there right now

01:00:26.174 --> 01:00:29.394
and you"re gonna apologize
for all of this.

01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:32.352
And you better hope he
doesn"t press charges.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.080
Let"s go.

01:00:47.574 --> 01:00:48.862
Randall.

01:00:48.886 --> 01:00:50.036
Guys, what"s going on?

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.796
Hey there, Wayne.

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.868
Uh, listen, the boys have
something they need to tell you.

01:00:54.892 --> 01:00:56.352
And I want to
apologize in advance.

01:00:56.376 --> 01:00:58.527
Just know that Sheila
and I are as outraged

01:00:58.551 --> 01:01:00.253
as you are about to be.

01:01:00.277 --> 01:01:03.280
I"m sure whatever it
is we can work it out.

01:01:08.285 --> 01:01:11.264
Um... hey, Mr. Mackey.

01:01:11.288 --> 01:01:15.889
We just wanted to
say we"re sorry.

01:01:15.913 --> 01:01:19.859
You probably thought it was
raccoons that dug up your garden

01:01:19.883 --> 01:01:22.240
and your garbage.

01:01:22.264 --> 01:01:24.957
It was us.

01:01:26.268 --> 01:01:28.477
Tell him why.

01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:40.017
A few weeks ago I thought I
saw this boy in your house.

01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:48.041
We were playing manhunt and
I had this idea that...

01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:51.777
you were maybe the
Cape May Slayer.

01:01:54.607 --> 01:01:56.930
Oh.

01:01:56.954 --> 01:02:00.244
Well.

01:02:00.268 --> 01:02:01.486
Uh...

01:02:07.137 --> 01:02:09.736
I"m sorry, it's just the
uh, guys at the station

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.325
are gonna love this.

01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:16.398
So who was the boy
that was here?

01:02:16.422 --> 01:02:17.882
That was my nephew, Jamie.

01:02:17.906 --> 01:02:19.781
He was helping me to
renovate the dark room.

01:02:19.805 --> 01:02:23.439
I thought you didn"t
have family nearby.

01:02:23.463 --> 01:02:24.820
And we found this in your shed.

01:02:24.844 --> 01:02:26.684
David.

01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:27.996
You broke into my
shed, too, huh?

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.687
You don"t have to
answer any of this.

01:02:29.711 --> 01:02:30.619
I"m sorry.

01:02:30.643 --> 01:02:32.000
No, no, it"s fine.

01:02:32.024 --> 01:02:33.967
We were hammering nails all
day, he probably cut himself.

01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:35.711
Why don"t you guys come
in, we can call him,

01:02:35.735 --> 01:02:36.975
we can clear this up right now.

01:02:36.999 --> 01:02:38.627
That is not necessary at all.

01:02:38.651 --> 01:02:40.698
Look, we just wanted to let
you know what happened

01:02:40.722 --> 01:02:43.287
and uh, the boys promise to fix
anything that they damaged

01:02:43.311 --> 01:02:45.289
no matter how long it takes.

01:02:45.313 --> 01:02:47.015
Right?

01:02:47.039 --> 01:02:50.294
Yes, sir.

01:02:50.318 --> 01:02:52.192
Look, I appreciate the
apology but honestly,

01:02:52.216 --> 01:02:54.954
no hard feelings.

01:02:54.978 --> 01:02:57.128
I remember what it was like
to be a boy in the summer.

01:02:57.152 --> 01:02:58.820
It"s hard to pass
up an adventure.

01:02:58.844 --> 01:03:02.019
You are a better man than
me, Wayne, thank you.

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:06.482
This doesn"t change anything.

01:03:06.506 --> 01:03:07.794
Are you high?

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:09.554
Your summer"s fucked.

01:03:09.578 --> 01:03:12.143
We may get out of this
with just garden duty.

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:14.448
I"m not risking the little of
the good life I"ve got left.

01:03:14.472 --> 01:03:16.838
Yeah, Davey, spying on
Mackey was fun and stuff

01:03:16.862 --> 01:03:18.736
but this is way too heavy.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.463
I"m out.

01:03:21.487 --> 01:03:24.121
Guys, go home.

01:03:24.145 --> 01:03:26.465
And I"m calling all your parents
and I will be telling them

01:03:26.489 --> 01:03:28.194
what happened.

01:03:28.218 --> 01:03:29.840
Go.

01:03:30.772 --> 01:03:32.681
Not you.

01:03:32.705 --> 01:03:34.856
You are grounded until
further notice.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.859
I"m so disappointed
in you, David.

01:03:37.883 --> 01:03:40.585
Just-look, just go home and
do not come out of your room

01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:42.680
until I say so.

01:04:09.431 --> 01:04:11.202
Hello?

01:04:11.226 --> 01:04:13.850
Can you come over?

01:04:17.715 --> 01:04:20.729
It"s so surreal.

01:04:20.753 --> 01:04:25.527
It feels like I was
just a kid, you know?

01:04:25.551 --> 01:04:27.736
Oh my god.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.911
Look at this one.

01:04:29.935 --> 01:04:31.913
That is definitely coming
with me to Stanford.

01:04:31.937 --> 01:04:32.706
Oh god, really?

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:33.776
Can"t we just burn it?

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.708
What?

01:04:34.732 --> 01:04:35.606
No way.

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:38.264
It"s a classic.

01:04:38.288 --> 01:04:40.328
You know, I didn"t think I
was gonna miss this place

01:04:40.352 --> 01:04:43.614
but now I can"t deal.

01:04:43.638 --> 01:04:45.616
Everyone"s talking to me
like I"m already gone.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.894
It"s wigging me out.

01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:53.037
You know, it just feels
like the end, you know?

01:04:53.061 --> 01:04:59.388
And the closer it gets
the more I feel alone.

01:04:59.412 --> 01:05:02.174
Hey, you"re not alone.

01:05:05.028 --> 01:05:06.948
After today I wish I could
get out of this stupid

01:05:06.972 --> 01:05:09.122
neighbourhood with you.

01:05:09.146 --> 01:05:10.572
I"m sorry.

01:05:10.596 --> 01:05:12.667
You wanna leave?

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:16.405
Holy shit.

01:05:16.429 --> 01:05:19.098
You got caught.

01:05:19.122 --> 01:05:21.100
Davey!

01:05:21.124 --> 01:05:23.688
My dad made me admit the
whole thing to Mackey.

01:05:23.712 --> 01:05:25.621
No he didn"t.

01:05:25.645 --> 01:05:27.313
Oh my god.

01:05:27.337 --> 01:05:28.970
I"m so grounded.

01:05:28.994 --> 01:05:33.629
I"m-I'm gonna be locked up
until I leave for college.

01:05:33.653 --> 01:05:37.323
Wait, if you"re grounded how
are you here right now?

01:05:37.347 --> 01:05:39.842
Well, my parents
are downtown so I-

01:05:39.866 --> 01:05:41.430
I just snuck out.

01:05:41.454 --> 01:05:43.708
Just a rebel without a cause.

01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:45.848
You"re done now, right?

01:05:45.872 --> 01:05:47.540
Right?

01:05:47.564 --> 01:05:52.372
Well, the guys all bailed on me
so there"s not much I can do.

01:05:52.396 --> 01:05:55.030
I know I"m right about him.

01:05:55.054 --> 01:05:57.032
That"s the shittiest part.

01:05:57.056 --> 01:05:59.207
Just let it go.

01:05:59.231 --> 01:06:01.485
You only get a chance
to be a kid once.

01:06:01.509 --> 01:06:04.281
Believe me, I know.

01:06:04.305 --> 01:06:08.457
So enjoy it while you can.

01:06:08.481 --> 01:06:14.384
But if I"m right,
who"s gonna stop him?

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.760
Davey.

01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:39.557
How"s it going?

01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:41.042
What"re you doing here?

01:06:41.066 --> 01:06:43.078
Just kinda wanna make
sure that we"re good.

01:06:43.102 --> 01:06:47.013
I feel bad about everything
that happened yesterday.

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:48.277
Mind if I come in for a second?

01:06:48.301 --> 01:06:49.106
We can talk about it?

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.155
Now is not a good time.

01:06:51.179 --> 01:06:53.882
Ok.

01:06:53.906 --> 01:06:55.346
Hey, you know that
we"ve got everyone

01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:58.059
that we have looking
for this sicko, right?

01:06:58.083 --> 01:07:00.026
Why haven"t you found him yet?

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:01.614
Well, these things take time.

01:07:01.638 --> 01:07:03.926
Sometimes years.

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:07.033
If you want I can stop
by, give you updates.

01:07:07.057 --> 01:07:08.897
No, you don"t have to do that.

01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:11.072
I see the paper before
anyone, remember?

01:07:11.096 --> 01:07:12.038
You sure?

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:13.246
It"d be my pleasure.

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:15.070
I can tell you have an
interest in this stuff.

01:07:15.094 --> 01:07:18.079
Was there anything else, Mr.
Mackey?

01:07:18.103 --> 01:07:21.416
Wow, you uh, you really
got it in for me, huh?

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.464
Uh... Davey, I like you.

01:07:24.488 --> 01:07:25.914
I think you"re a
good kid, alright?

01:07:25.938 --> 01:07:27.898
The last thing I want is
for there to be bad blood

01:07:27.922 --> 01:07:29.400
between us.

01:07:29.424 --> 01:07:31.092
Yeah, me too.

01:07:31.116 --> 01:07:36.097
It"s just uh, my summer's
basically destroyed

01:07:36.121 --> 01:07:38.961
and I"m pretty sure my
parents hate me now.

01:07:38.985 --> 01:07:40.105
You want me to talk to them?

01:07:40.129 --> 01:07:41.449
See if I can lighten
the sentence?

01:07:41.473 --> 01:07:42.413
I"m happy to do that.

01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:44.208
No, it's... it's alright.

01:07:44.232 --> 01:07:47.625
Thanks, though.

01:07:47.649 --> 01:07:51.077
You"ve got quite
the imagination.

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:53.666
Yeah, I guess.

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:56.807
Um... my dad says it's because
I read too many mysteries

01:07:56.831 --> 01:07:59.672
and with the killer on the
loose I got caught up in it.

01:07:59.696 --> 01:08:01.087
I get it.

01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:03.331
That"s the whole
reason I became a cop.

01:08:03.355 --> 01:08:05.126
It"s exciting, the
stuff that"s going on.

01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:07.576
And you wanna help,
and that"s great.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.856
And I"ll admit that the stuff
that you thought was proof

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.687
looks pretty bad out of context.

01:08:14.711 --> 01:08:18.277
You got a pretty good brain
for this kind of work.

01:08:18.301 --> 01:08:21.590
Davey, is there anything I can
do to help smooth things over?

01:08:21.613 --> 01:08:27.424
Um... well, yesterday you
offered to call your nephew.

01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:30.323
Would you mind maybe
just calling him now?

01:08:30.346 --> 01:08:32.670
Absolutely.

01:08:32.694 --> 01:08:35.363
Just kinda gotta...
come in to do that.

01:08:35.386 --> 01:08:39.125
Uh, no, no, actually our
cord"s really long.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:41.462
Just wait here a sec.

01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:49.825
Shit!

01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:51.988
Shit.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.495
Place looks great.

01:09:04.519 --> 01:09:07.015
I haven't been in here since...
you must have been a toddler.

01:09:07.038 --> 01:09:09.362
I helped your dad get some
stuff into the attic.

01:09:11.077 --> 01:09:13.666
My sister"s in Seattle.

01:09:20.742 --> 01:09:23.411
Hmm.

01:09:23.435 --> 01:09:26.345
Not answering.

01:09:26.368 --> 01:09:27.415
Jamie"s big into baseball.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:30.234
He might be at
practice or something.

01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:35.698
Well, maybe I"ll come back
later, we can try him again.

01:09:35.723 --> 01:09:36.389
Uh, no.

01:09:36.412 --> 01:09:38.219
It"s ok.

01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:40.944
Look, I"m sorry for
being such an idiot.

01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:43.879
I promise I"ll fix your garden
even better than it was.

01:09:43.903 --> 01:09:46.779
No hard feelings.

01:09:46.803 --> 01:09:49.402
Sorry again that
you"re uh, grounded.

01:09:49.426 --> 01:09:52.291
I"m gonna see if I can get
you outta this house.

01:09:54.154 --> 01:09:56.133
Listen, Davey.

01:09:56.157 --> 01:09:58.756
I"m gonna do everything I
can to catch this bastard.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:00.713
I promise.

01:10:17.765 --> 01:10:20.364
Operator, how may I
direct your call?

01:10:20.388 --> 01:10:25.266
Um, can you tell me the last
number dialed from this house?

01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:33.290
The last number dialed from
that residence was 555-0167.

01:10:45.206 --> 01:10:47.080
How are you guys not
freaking out right now?

01:10:47.104 --> 01:10:48.634
He called himself.

01:10:48.658 --> 01:10:50.187
There"s no Jamie.

01:10:50.211 --> 01:10:51.568
This proves he"s guilty.

01:10:51.592 --> 01:10:53.432
We gotta get into that
house to find out what"s

01:10:53.456 --> 01:10:54.122
in the basement.

01:10:54.146 --> 01:10:55.675
Are you crazy?

01:10:55.699 --> 01:10:58.437
Look how much trouble we got in
just for digging up his garden.

01:10:58.461 --> 01:10:59.679
Davey?

01:10:59.703 --> 01:11:00.853
Come down here.

01:11:00.877 --> 01:11:02.820
Shit.

01:11:02.844 --> 01:11:04.644
If I think she knows
you"re up here I'll radio

01:11:04.668 --> 01:11:07.153
so you can climb up the window.

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:11.415
I want you to see this.

01:11:11.439 --> 01:11:13.359
Please stand by as we
join a press conference

01:11:13.383 --> 01:11:15.695
underway at city hall for
an update in the case of

01:11:15.719 --> 01:11:17.318
the Cape May Slayer.

01:11:18.481 --> 01:11:19.841
We are happy to
report that we have

01:11:19.865 --> 01:11:23.462
the Cape May Slayer in custody.

01:11:23.486 --> 01:11:26.327
Thanks to the fine efforts of
the Ipswich Police Department,

01:11:26.351 --> 01:11:30.493
we apprehended Mr. Arthur
Ray Peterson earlier today.

01:11:32.529 --> 01:11:35.888
And I would like to bring
up the arresting officer.

01:11:35.912 --> 01:11:36.992
No, I think it"s perfect.

01:11:37.016 --> 01:11:38.304
Wayne Mackey.

01:11:40.226 --> 01:11:43.033
This is what everyone needs.

01:11:43.057 --> 01:11:44.897
I know that this is uh,
it"s been a trying time

01:11:44.921 --> 01:11:48.176
for our community but uh, we
hope that this announcement

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.178
can bring a little peace

01:11:50.202 --> 01:11:52.353
to those who have
been living in fear.

01:11:52.377 --> 01:11:54.147
I"ll be there in a few. Bye.

01:11:54.171 --> 01:11:55.494
Justice will be served.

01:11:58.279 --> 01:12:00.050
The Bay Festival"s back on,

01:12:00.074 --> 01:12:02.224
and all because of Mr. Mackey.

01:12:02.248 --> 01:12:03.448
So while we"re all celebrating

01:12:03.472 --> 01:12:05.642
I want you to think
about your actions.

01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:08.092
It turns out the man across
the street is not a killer,

01:12:08.116 --> 01:12:09.887
David.

01:12:09.911 --> 01:12:12.189
He"s a hero.

01:12:15.607 --> 01:12:16.722
A hero.

01:12:16.746 --> 01:12:18.724
Did you guys not
hear the broadcast?

01:12:18.748 --> 01:12:20.381
He"s clearly guilty.

01:12:20.405 --> 01:12:22.383
And you"re clearly
fucked in the head.

01:12:22.407 --> 01:12:23.687
Dude, he just caught the killer.

01:12:23.711 --> 01:12:25.109
It can"t be him.

01:12:25.133 --> 01:12:27.414
Don"t you think it's a little
coincidental that the person

01:12:27.438 --> 01:12:30.045
we just accused of being
the killer just so happens

01:12:30.069 --> 01:12:31.944
to then catch the killer?

01:12:31.968 --> 01:12:34.222
Dude, you just sound
desperate now, ok?

01:12:34.246 --> 01:12:35.534
Just admit you were wrong.

01:12:35.558 --> 01:12:37.018
I"m not wrong.

01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:39.082
And I know there"s something
behind that locked door

01:12:39.106 --> 01:12:40.401
in his basement.

01:12:40.425 --> 01:12:43.231
We have to find out what it
is before more people die.

01:12:43.255 --> 01:12:44.715
Listen, Davey.

01:12:44.739 --> 01:12:46.614
Even if you were to
hypothetically get

01:12:46.638 --> 01:12:48.029
into his basement,

01:12:48.053 --> 01:12:50.272
there"s no way you could
take anything to prove it

01:12:50.296 --> 01:12:51.688
without him knowing
that it"s you.

01:12:51.712 --> 01:12:52.930
I don"t have to.

01:12:52.954 --> 01:12:55.312
I"ll use my dad's
camcorder, film it all.

01:12:55.336 --> 01:12:57.694
No need to steal anything
if I get it on tape.

01:12:57.718 --> 01:13:00.341
Tape doesn"t lie.

01:13:04.414 --> 01:13:06.875
I know you guys all
think I"m crazy,

01:13:06.899 --> 01:13:08.877
but I"m gonna prove it to you.

01:13:08.901 --> 01:13:11.880
Look, I"ll take
all the risk, ok?

01:13:11.904 --> 01:13:13.813
I just need you guys
to watch my back.

01:13:13.837 --> 01:13:17.161
Make sure Mackey doesn"t
come home while I"m inside.

01:13:17.185 --> 01:13:18.646
No.

01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:20.958
I"m done with this shit, ok?

01:13:20.982 --> 01:13:23.616
You"re gonna get caught, either
by Mackey or your dad or-

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.238
No.

01:13:25.262 --> 01:13:27.502
Because everyone"s gonna be
at the Bay Festival tomorrow.

01:13:27.526 --> 01:13:29.346
All I need you to do is
set up at the bus stop

01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:31.659
down the street, ok?

01:13:31.683 --> 01:13:32.487
And Farraday-

01:13:32.511 --> 01:13:33.799
No, dude.

01:13:33.823 --> 01:13:35.503
You know that my parents
take me every year

01:13:35.527 --> 01:13:37.250
and there is no way
they"d let me ditch.

01:13:37.274 --> 01:13:40.564
Which is why I need you to
keep an eye on Mackey there.

01:13:40.588 --> 01:13:43.843
If he leaves the party early
just give me a heads up.

01:13:43.867 --> 01:13:46.328
Woody, I need you to stay
and watch right outside

01:13:46.352 --> 01:13:48.469
his house.

01:13:48.493 --> 01:13:50.413
With multiple layers of
protection there"s no way

01:13:50.437 --> 01:13:53.681
I get caught.

01:13:53.705 --> 01:13:56.856
Are you with me?

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.927
Whatever. Fine.

01:13:58.951 --> 01:14:02.586
But if shit goes sideways
I"m pinning it all on you.

01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:04.163
Yeah.

01:14:06.614 --> 01:14:09.548
This is your last shot, Davey.

01:14:12.827 --> 01:14:16.393
I mean, if you think there"s
something down there...

01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:19.006
I guess I"m in, too.

01:14:30.845 --> 01:14:32.064
This is so not fair.

01:14:32.088 --> 01:14:33.134
David.

01:14:33.158 --> 01:14:34.894
Punishment"s a punishment, pal.

01:14:34.918 --> 01:14:37.078
If you really cared about
going you wouldn"t have acted

01:14:37.102 --> 01:14:38.484
like a delinquent all summer.

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:41.004
Hey, just let me go and I"ll
be grounded again after.

01:14:41.028 --> 01:14:43.271
Not happening, end of story.

01:15:00.703 --> 01:15:02.646
Alright guys, it"s go time.

01:15:35.496 --> 01:15:36.577
I got eyes on him.

01:15:36.601 --> 01:15:38.579
Over.

01:15:38.603 --> 01:15:39.856
Roger that.

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.467
How"re you looking, Eats?

01:15:57.967 --> 01:16:02.879
What? Can"t take a
little family time?

01:16:02.903 --> 01:16:04.801
Fuck off, Kyle.

01:16:05.607 --> 01:16:06.607
Eats.

01:16:06.631 --> 01:16:07.711
Eats.

01:16:07.735 --> 01:16:12.647
Are you in position?

01:16:12.671 --> 01:16:14.407
You want a lift, limp dick?

01:16:14.431 --> 01:16:17.331
Why, you need an alibi?

01:16:33.658 --> 01:16:34.866
Ok.

01:16:35.832 --> 01:16:37.178
Hold this.

01:16:38.283 --> 01:16:39.767
This, too.

01:16:47.948 --> 01:16:49.501
Come on.

01:17:04.389 --> 01:17:05.389
Can you hold it?

01:17:05.413 --> 01:17:06.528
Yeah.

01:17:06.552 --> 01:17:08.013
Here.

01:17:08.037 --> 01:17:10.291
If you see anything,
make some noise.

01:17:10.315 --> 01:17:11.672
Alright?

01:17:11.696 --> 01:17:12.534
Move over.

01:17:12.558 --> 01:17:13.777
What for?

01:17:13.801 --> 01:17:14.813
I"m not gonna let my
best friend go in

01:17:14.837 --> 01:17:16.400
a serial killer"s house alone.

01:17:16.424 --> 01:17:17.539
Hold the window.

01:17:17.563 --> 01:17:20.025
Ok.

01:17:20.049 --> 01:17:20.681
You good?

01:17:20.705 --> 01:17:22.879
Yeah. I think so.

01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:25.433
Alright, let"s go.

01:17:26.066 --> 01:17:27.066
Thanks, Woody.

01:17:27.090 --> 01:17:28.896
I owe you one.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.160
Let"s just make this quick, ok?

01:17:30.184 --> 01:17:31.657
Ok.

01:17:31.681 --> 01:17:32.969
What are you guys doing?

01:17:38.032 --> 01:17:39.492
Why do you keep
doing that to us?

01:17:39.516 --> 01:17:41.702
Because it"s so easy.

01:17:41.726 --> 01:17:42.703
What"re you doing here?

01:17:42.727 --> 01:17:45.015
I figured you"d need some help.

01:17:45.039 --> 01:17:46.568
I thought you said I
should let it go.

01:17:46.592 --> 01:17:50.010
Yeah, but if you"re right,
who else is gonna stop him?

01:18:34.123 --> 01:18:36.549
Oh, come on.

01:18:36.573 --> 01:18:38.551
Davey?

01:18:38.575 --> 01:18:40.139
Davey, do you copy?

01:18:40.163 --> 01:18:41.382
Is he on his way back?

01:18:41.406 --> 01:18:42.038
Way worse.

01:18:42.062 --> 01:18:43.108
You were wrong.

01:18:43.132 --> 01:18:44.412
You were wrong about everything.

01:18:44.436 --> 01:18:45.379
The dirt, the shovels,
the pick axe,

01:18:45.403 --> 01:18:46.490
it was all for a project

01:18:46.514 --> 01:18:48.234
Mackey was doing with
the police department.

01:18:48.258 --> 01:18:50.408
They planted a shitload
of flowers down here.

01:18:50.432 --> 01:18:52.117
Listen to me.

01:18:52.141 --> 01:18:53.497
It"s over.

01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:54.464
No, Farraday, wait.

01:18:54.488 --> 01:18:55.430
I"m sorry, man.

01:18:55.454 --> 01:18:57.294
But you"re on your own.

01:18:57.318 --> 01:18:58.744
Maybe he"s right.

01:18:58.768 --> 01:19:00.919
We should just go.

01:19:00.943 --> 01:19:04.163
I mean, we"re already here.

01:19:04.187 --> 01:19:06.062
We might as well
just check it out.

01:19:06.086 --> 01:19:08.236
And if it"s not him
then we know, right?

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:10.169
It"s him.

01:19:10.193 --> 01:19:14.070
Look, Eats is still in
position so we"re safe.

01:19:14.094 --> 01:19:17.694
We have to look "cause we"re
about to find the proof.

01:19:17.718 --> 01:19:20.307
I know it.

01:19:53.029 --> 01:19:55.180
Please tell me somebody
brought a flashlight.

01:19:55.204 --> 01:19:58.138
Oh, uh, there should be
one on the camcorder.

01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:04.489
Ok, come on.

01:20:06.871 --> 01:20:08.769
Creepiest basement ever.

01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:19.860
Jesus fuck!

01:20:19.884 --> 01:20:20.884
Oh, jeez.

01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:22.759
Oh my god, calm down.

01:20:22.783 --> 01:20:23.898
It"s just a light.

01:20:23.922 --> 01:20:25.924
Are you ok?

01:20:27.581 --> 01:20:28.893
Ok.

01:20:39.328 --> 01:20:40.328
Quiet down!

01:20:40.352 --> 01:20:42.389
Take a chill pill!

01:20:44.184 --> 01:20:46.576
Shine the flashlight
on the lock.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:49.165
What"re you doing?

01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:51.029
Seriously, did Eats
teach you this?

01:20:51.053 --> 01:20:52.744
It doesn"t work.

01:20:58.301 --> 01:20:59.785
Shit.

01:21:15.767 --> 01:21:16.951
Vagina!

01:21:16.975 --> 01:21:18.711
Farraday, you fucking dick!

01:21:18.735 --> 01:21:19.895
What are you even doing here?

01:21:19.919 --> 01:21:20.861
You"re supposed to
be watching Mackey.

01:21:20.885 --> 01:21:22.198
The whole thing"s off.

01:21:22.222 --> 01:21:23.751
Mackey"s clean, 100 percent.

01:21:23.775 --> 01:21:25.580
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:21:25.604 --> 01:21:27.444
It"s a long story.

01:21:27.468 --> 01:21:28.618
Just trust me.

01:21:28.642 --> 01:21:29.791
It"s not him.

01:21:29.815 --> 01:21:30.447
Fuck that.

01:21:30.471 --> 01:21:31.932
I gotta hear this.

01:21:31.956 --> 01:21:35.487
Maybe I could sleep at
your place tonight?

01:21:35.511 --> 01:21:37.282
Parents again?

01:21:37.306 --> 01:21:40.112
How bad is it this time?

01:21:40.136 --> 01:21:43.312
Let"s just say I don't wanna
witness a murder suicide.

01:21:44.969 --> 01:21:46.832
Yeah.

01:21:55.324 --> 01:21:58.085
But I"m not watching
Gilligan"s Island.

01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:12.341
What the hell is this place?

01:22:13.342 --> 01:22:17.484
You think he... keeps his
victims here or something?

01:22:24.146 --> 01:22:25.847
Guys.

01:22:25.871 --> 01:22:33.269
"“To Wayne. Keep it up, slugger.
1958."”

01:22:33.293 --> 01:22:35.616
Holy shit, was this his room?

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.342
When he was a kid?

01:22:37.366 --> 01:22:39.654
That doesn"t make any sense.

01:22:39.678 --> 01:22:43.130
I mean, these houses weren"t
even built back then.

01:22:45.063 --> 01:22:47.410
God, suburbia is so fucked up.

01:22:48.998 --> 01:22:50.918
Davey, you said there was
gonna be evidence here.

01:22:50.942 --> 01:22:52.875
Where is it?

01:22:55.832 --> 01:22:57.593
Oh my god!

01:23:01.321 --> 01:23:02.332
No, no, no, no.

01:23:02.356 --> 01:23:04.910
Davey, no, no.

01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:09.063
Just make sure you"re filming.

01:23:09.087 --> 01:23:11.089
No, Davey, wait.

01:23:40.567 --> 01:23:43.235
Is this enough proof for you?

01:23:43.259 --> 01:23:45.513
Davey, we need to go.

01:23:45.537 --> 01:23:46.169
Now.

01:23:46.193 --> 01:23:47.688
Come on.

01:23:47.712 --> 01:23:49.127
Wait, what"s that?

01:23:49.645 --> 01:23:51.519
Oh my god.

01:23:58.976 --> 01:23:59.976
Oh my god!

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.277
Help...

01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:06.189
Come on, guys.

01:24:06.213 --> 01:24:06.707
Come on.

01:24:06.731 --> 01:24:07.397
Are you ok?

01:24:07.421 --> 01:24:08.709
Watch out, watch out.

01:24:08.733 --> 01:24:09.399
Let"s go.

01:24:09.423 --> 01:24:10.055
Let"s go.

01:24:10.079 --> 01:24:11.608
Come on.

01:24:11.632 --> 01:24:12.885
Oh my god, Davey!

01:24:12.909 --> 01:24:13.817
Davey, let"s go!

01:24:13.841 --> 01:24:14.611
Davey, come on!

01:24:14.635 --> 01:24:16.234
We gotta get out of here!

01:24:16.258 --> 01:24:17.925
Davey!

01:24:17.949 --> 01:24:19.064
What are you looking at?

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:19.927
Holy shit!

01:24:19.951 --> 01:24:21.780
Davey! Davey!

01:24:24.231 --> 01:24:26.406
Guys, the people in the
pictures aren"t his family.

01:24:28.994 --> 01:24:30.513
They"re his victims.

01:24:31.169 --> 01:24:32.584
What?

01:24:36.174 --> 01:24:37.796
I"m next.

01:24:39.177 --> 01:24:40.316
Oh my god.

01:24:42.456 --> 01:24:44.469
Is this enough proof for you?

01:24:44.493 --> 01:24:46.850
Davey, we need to go.

01:24:46.874 --> 01:24:47.334
Now.

01:24:47.358 --> 01:24:49.084
Come on.

01:25:01.613 --> 01:25:03.419
You found all this in his house?

01:25:03.443 --> 01:25:04.592
Yeah, and there"s
pictures of dead people

01:25:04.616 --> 01:25:05.973
"all over the freakin" walls!

01:25:05.997 --> 01:25:07.802
What were you even doing there?

01:25:07.826 --> 01:25:09.770
Get out to Mackey"s.

01:25:09.794 --> 01:25:12.624
Bring that sick son
of a bitch to me.

01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:15.110
Let's go.

01:25:16.525 --> 01:25:18.261
You folks should be proud.

01:25:18.285 --> 01:25:22.162
That boy"s alive
because of your son.

01:25:22.186 --> 01:25:24.198
He"s a hero.

01:25:43.345 --> 01:25:44.667
You ok?

01:25:44.691 --> 01:25:46.462
Uh, yeah.

01:25:46.486 --> 01:25:48.671
What"re you doing
out here all alone?

01:25:48.695 --> 01:25:51.087
My parents are giving
a report, I guess.

01:25:51.111 --> 01:25:53.503
Hmm.

01:25:53.527 --> 01:25:58.819
Kinda feels like none of
this is actually real.

01:25:58.843 --> 01:26:03.858
My parents just got here and
I saw them hug each other

01:26:03.882 --> 01:26:06.240
for the first time
in a while, so...

01:26:06.264 --> 01:26:08.000
Well, that"s awesome, right?

01:26:08.024 --> 01:26:11.003
I"m not gonna get my hopes
up, but it happened

01:26:11.027 --> 01:26:12.660
because of you.

01:26:12.684 --> 01:26:14.686
I don"t know about that.

01:26:17.896 --> 01:26:20.347
See ya, Davey.

01:26:53.277 --> 01:26:55.945
I love you, pal.

01:26:55.969 --> 01:26:59.086
And I"m so sorry.

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:00.087
I"m proud of you.

01:27:00.111 --> 01:27:02.907
I"m real proud.

01:27:21.443 --> 01:27:23.800
Davey"s got the sleeping
bag all set up for you.

01:27:23.824 --> 01:27:25.824
And when your mom gets off
her shift in the morning

01:27:25.848 --> 01:27:27.287
she will pick you up.

01:27:27.311 --> 01:27:30.773
Thanks, Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong.

01:27:30.797 --> 01:27:33.293
You guys are safe now.

01:27:33.317 --> 01:27:36.630
We"ll keep an eye out and make
sure nothing else happens.

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:41.749
I wonder where he is.

01:27:41.773 --> 01:27:43.579
Well, the APB"s
been out for hours.

01:27:43.603 --> 01:27:44.925
They"ll get him.

01:27:44.949 --> 01:27:47.607
It"s just a matter of time.

01:27:49.298 --> 01:27:53.002
We love you.

01:27:53.026 --> 01:27:55.038
You boys are gonna be
the talk of the town.

01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:57.178
How does that feel?

01:27:57.202 --> 01:28:00.378
Nothing"s ever gonna
be the same again.

01:28:05.349 --> 01:28:08.248
Alright, get some rest, you two.

01:28:09.249 --> 01:28:10.468
Goodnight.

01:28:10.492 --> 01:28:12.701
"Night."

01:28:18.396 --> 01:28:20.961
You think they"ll catch him?

01:28:20.985 --> 01:28:23.722
There"s nowhere left
for him to hide.

01:28:23.746 --> 01:28:27.336
It"s over. We got him.

01:30:58.901 --> 01:31:06.609
Woody! Woody!

01:31:06.633 --> 01:31:09.301
Get up!

01:31:09.325 --> 01:31:10.855
Turn around.

01:31:10.879 --> 01:31:11.994
I"ll untie you.

01:31:22.753 --> 01:31:25.169
It"s Mackey!

01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:28.103
I can"t see shit!

01:31:29.414 --> 01:31:30.692
What the fuck was that?!

01:31:35.006 --> 01:31:36.190
We gotta get outta here!

01:31:36.214 --> 01:31:36.984
No, no, no, no!

01:31:37.008 --> 01:31:39.573
Yes, we have to!

01:31:39.597 --> 01:31:42.876
Wait-he"s-he's out there.

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:50.435
Where is he?

01:31:52.299 --> 01:31:53.680
Oh, my god, run!!!

01:31:58.685 --> 01:32:01.043
I know how much you
guys like games.

01:32:01.067 --> 01:32:03.414
So I got a surprise for you.

01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:06.842
We"re gonna play manhunt.

01:32:06.866 --> 01:32:09.396
Only now we are gonna
play it for real!

01:32:10.973 --> 01:32:12.779
It"s ok. He can't catch
us if we keep moving.

01:32:12.803 --> 01:32:13.745
Alright?

01:32:13.769 --> 01:32:15.747
We gotta go. Let"s go.

01:32:33.513 --> 01:32:34.594
What-what the hell?

01:32:34.618 --> 01:32:35.318
Shit!

01:32:35.342 --> 01:32:36.827
Come on.

01:32:49.011 --> 01:32:51.645
Where did he take us?

01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:53.129
It"s a tidal island.

01:32:53.153 --> 01:32:53.751
It has to be.

01:32:53.775 --> 01:32:54.337
Fuck.

01:32:54.361 --> 01:32:55.580
What do we do?

01:32:55.604 --> 01:32:56.270
If we-if we just keep
going, eventually-

01:32:56.294 --> 01:32:56.926
We"ll find a road.

01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:58.469
Come on.

01:33:11.689 --> 01:33:12.735
It"s ok, it's ok.

01:33:12.759 --> 01:33:13.759
It"s ok.

01:33:15.313 --> 01:33:17.384
I know where you are.

01:33:29.327 --> 01:33:31.122
I know you"re close!

01:33:32.641 --> 01:33:33.998
We gotta get to the cruiser.

01:33:34.022 --> 01:33:36.656
I can"t die tonight,
my mom needs me.

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.312
You"re not gonna die.

01:33:38.336 --> 01:33:42.765
I got you into this mess, I"m
gonna get you out of it.

01:33:42.789 --> 01:33:43.939
I"m gonna be your diversion.

01:33:43.963 --> 01:33:45.941
No, no, no!

01:33:45.965 --> 01:33:48.405
I"m gonna get his attention so
you can get to the cruiser, ok?

01:33:48.429 --> 01:33:49.164
Find a way out!

01:33:49.188 --> 01:33:50.670
No! No, I can"t-

01:33:50.694 --> 01:33:52.672
Hey, Wayne! Fuck you!

01:33:52.696 --> 01:33:55.250
I am over here, you
fucking loser!

01:34:21.103 --> 01:34:23.012
Stay the fuck there.

01:34:23.036 --> 01:34:24.048
Woody! Woody!

01:34:24.072 --> 01:34:25.729
He"s coming!

01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:29.008
Woody!

01:34:29.733 --> 01:34:31.400
Run!

01:34:43.712 --> 01:34:44.724
Davey! Davey!

01:34:44.748 --> 01:34:46.542
Davey! Davey!

01:34:47.026 --> 01:34:49.867
No! No!

01:35:30.794 --> 01:35:32.450
Woody! Woody!

01:35:43.289 --> 01:35:45.577
You brought this on yourself.

01:35:45.601 --> 01:35:48.235
All you had to do
was leave me alone.

01:35:48.259 --> 01:35:50.306
This is your goddamn fault!

01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:51.100
I"m sorry.

01:35:51.124 --> 01:35:53.620
I"m sorry.

01:35:53.644 --> 01:35:56.796
You forced me out of my home.

01:35:56.820 --> 01:36:01.939
You stole my life!

01:36:01.963 --> 01:36:04.665
You do not get to be sorry.

01:36:09.039 --> 01:36:14.537
All I wanna do is kill you.

01:36:14.561 --> 01:36:18.438
That"s not enough for you.

01:36:18.462 --> 01:36:25.997
You have spent so much
time thinking about me.

01:36:26.021 --> 01:36:31.934
I want you to keep
thinking about me.

01:36:31.958 --> 01:36:35.869
I want you to imagine
what I am going to do

01:36:35.893 --> 01:36:41.288
when I come back for you.

01:36:41.312 --> 01:36:45.327
And I am going to
come back for you.

01:36:45.351 --> 01:36:50.746
After you have spent your life
looking over your shoulder.

01:36:50.770 --> 01:36:53.818
After you have wondered
every single day

01:36:53.842 --> 01:37:00.031
if that is the day that
I"m gonna come for you.

01:37:00.055 --> 01:37:06.751
One day... you'll be right.

01:39:47.533 --> 01:39:50.950
You never know what might be
coming around the corner.

01:39:53.332 --> 01:39:55.689
And that"s the thing
about this place.

01:39:55.713 --> 01:39:58.761
It all might seem
normal and routine,

01:39:58.785 --> 01:40:00.315
but the truth is

01:40:00.339 --> 01:40:03.721
the suburbs are where the
craziest shit happens.

01:40:22.568 --> 01:40:25.926
Just past the manicured
lawns and friendly waves.

01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:30.724
Inside any house, even
the one next door,

01:40:30.748 --> 01:40:35.443
anything could be happening
and you"d never know.

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:40.389
If I"ve learned anything,

01:40:40.413 --> 01:40:43.934
it"s that people hardly ever let
you know who they really are.

01:40:50.251 --> 01:40:53.264
Tough pill to swallow, I know.

01:40:53.288 --> 01:40:55.808
But it"s true.

01:40:59.294 --> 01:41:02.401
Even serial killers live
next door to somebody.
