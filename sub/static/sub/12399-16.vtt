00:33.992 --> 00:36.278
How did you find me?

00:36.620 --> 00:39.077
I saw a photo of you on Facebook
from a company picnic.

00:39.248 --> 00:42.115
And I gotta tell you,
you look much better in person.

00:46.755 --> 00:50.794

I'm not normally the jealous type...

01:45.063 --> 01:51.229
...but did you wanna tell me
who Darlene643 from Cincinnati is?

01:52.571 --> 01:54.436
I can explain.

01:55.741 --> 01:56.947
You remember Heidecker?

-The guy with the plane full of kids?
-Uh, yeah, how could we forget?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.657
-Him and his psycho science friends.
-The Shop.

-That's what they call themselves?
-That's what I call them.

They make cool stuff that kills people.

messing around.

I could find. One finally paid off.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.336
I really hope you're not talking
about Darlene.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.640
I found parking stubs
in Heidecker's plane.

02:20.807 --> 02:24.891
I followed him to Cincinnati. Darlene
got me into the surveillance room.

02:26.021 --> 02:29.104
Her ID card got me
into the surveillance room.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.980
Now, this is him, in Kosovo.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.310
And this is him in Cincinnati.

He visited the same floor twice a month
for six months.

-Bellfar Systems.
-What does Bellfar do?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.784
-I don't know.
-Could be barking up the wrong tree.

military-grade encryption on their servers.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.993

so she couldn't get a look at him.

-Then what was he trying to do?
-Take out a server array.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.672
-Anything?
-The charge was small enough...

04:26.850 --> 04:29.182

-Not yet.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.448
This is a digital mask.

As were the surveillance images

-Alex, you told 300 trained killers...

to their head.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.613
Not all of them wanna stick around.

11:37.780 --> 11:42.023
What they don't know is if enough
people join the mutiny, it won't matter.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.988
It'll hit the tipping point.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.868
Tipping point?

11:46.039 --> 11:49.372
One, two people make a run, we call
them rogues, add them to the list.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.205
A half, even a third of our people
make a break for it, that is chaos.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.339
-There's only one way to cover that up.
-Send in the SEALs.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.715
When I told them about Danforth,
I did not intend--

12:02.889 --> 12:07.007
It could take Division down and there
won't be anything we can do about it.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.974

Sonya almost caught me.

12:13.149 --> 12:17.142
But she didn't. And they don't know the

kills us or the government does.

It can't.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.338
Just chill.

12:39.968 --> 12:43.552
There are other ways
to take out the trackers. That's only--

12:43.721 --> 12:44.836
Not good enough.

here and here.

Copy that.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.102
Ryan has Alex and Sean on this.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.639
Which is why you need
to cover your tracks.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.523
We are gonna get there, Chris.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.184
We are gonna be free.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.355

what that felt like.

The Shop wants us to break into a lab
in China and steal a biotech device.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.701
It's a delivery system for Prions,
protein-based infections...

13:15.878 --> 13:19.791
...that'll eventually allow us to cure
everything from colds to cancer.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.252
-Doesn't sound so bad.
-Well, it's hard to say.

13:22.427 --> 13:26.261
But this thing,
it actually infects you with a cure.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.514
Or Ebola or the T-virus.
Who knows, in six months...

13:29.684 --> 13:31.675
...we could be fighting off
zombie hordes.

13:31.853 --> 13:34.970
All right, what else have we found
on this Shop?

13:35.148 --> 13:38.561
They're probably a think tank
that develops tech for the US. Military.

13:39.569 --> 13:42.026
Putting this into US. hands
wouldn't be the worst.

13:42.196 --> 13:46.155
One thing you have to realize, Fletch,
is if we do this, it's a four-man op.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.566
We will need personnel.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.531
Nobody's gonna wanna hear
about a side mission. Not now.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.320
It'd have to be volunteer only.

for the others.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.863
Rachel.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.072
The plan to get everyone out...

33:18.288 --> 33:22.372
...was my idea. Without me, it dies.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.575
-I need names.
-I will take the fall for the others.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.791
I won't let them do the same for me.
They're dead without me.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.919
-We need to know who they are.
-That doesn't matter!

33:32.093 --> 33:35.927
Don't have to worry about any tipping point.
No one else is going rogue.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.297
What did you just say?

33:39.684 --> 33:41.595
I said it's over.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.100
RYAN:
Tipping point.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.937
How could you know about that?

33:47.108 --> 33:49.941
-It's just a phrase. I don't--
-I said that once.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.942
When I was talking to--

34:03.708 --> 34:07.451
Rachel says that she's the leader,
but that isn't true, is it?

34:09.798 --> 34:14.132
She's not taking the fall for the others.
She's taking the fall for you.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.335
Well, somebody
has to look out for them.

34:17.430 --> 34:22.720
If they stay, you, and Nikita, this place,
you're gonna get everyone killed.

34:22.936 --> 34:26.428
Alex, you can't possibly believe that.

34:26.648 --> 34:30.812
I've seen it. If Division is left standing,
more people are gonna die.

34:30.986 --> 34:33.568
Just like Jason and Larissa.

34:33.780 --> 34:35.987
-Laﬁssa?
-And all the other girls.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.996

34:42.163 --> 34:44.415
No, I will not let you hurt them again.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.660
Alex, what are you doing?

34:50.880 --> 34:53.496
-Stay away from me.
-Do it.

34:57.304 --> 35:01.923
-He's gonna turn us both in.
-Alex, think.

It's not too late to fix this.

35:31.171 --> 35:34.663
I got your signal. I was gonna take
the fall. I screwed up. I'm sorry.

35:34.841 --> 35:38.550
We have to get out of here. We gotta go

You're right. You're right. It's just us.

-No, the plan will still work.

-Make it look like you took my gun.
-They'l| think I shot him.

They're not gonna kill you.

They'll put you in holding,
they'll interrogate you.

One of them hacked an interrogation

Rachel grabbed my gun, took off firing.

37:41.134 --> 37:43.500
The only reason I didn't get shot was...

37:45.346 --> 37:47.337
...he took a bullet for me.

Okay, did Rachel say something

future or shutting this place down.

But I did not expect this.
This was unacceptable.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.693
Completely unacceptable.

38:48.243 --> 38:53.112
We used Division to steal the Prion
so you would appear to be a victim.

You're protected, Dr. Wong.

And Division? Did you get them
to stop asking questions about us?

All they know, or think they know,
is we are a U.S.-based organization...

39:21.943 --> 39:24.901
