WEBVTT

00:03.106 --> 00:04.176
Ohh, yeah!

00:11.977 --> 00:13.703
Who's got the power?

00:13.737 --> 00:15.153
♪ We got the power

00:17.396 --> 00:19.571
Who's got the power?

00:19.605 --> 00:21.193
♪ We got the power

00:21.228 --> 00:23.609
Oh! Yeah!

00:31.652 --> 00:34.758
Ah, another relaxing day
in the diamond store.

00:34.793 --> 00:37.037
The sun is shining,
birds are chirping,

00:37.071 --> 00:39.556
we've got Townsville's
largest donut-shaped diamond

00:39.591 --> 00:44.354
on display, and there's not
a single super villain in sight.

00:44.389 --> 00:45.631
Aah!

00:45.666 --> 00:48.048
You've got our
best friend hostage!

00:48.082 --> 00:49.394
We -- we do?

00:49.428 --> 00:53.363
Diamonds are a girl's best
friend -- especially that one!

00:53.398 --> 00:54.571
Hand her over!

00:54.606 --> 00:57.057
No! I won't let
you take it!

00:57.091 --> 00:59.887
Barbie, he's not
giving us our baby.

00:59.921 --> 01:02.752
See if you can
change his mind.

01:04.754 --> 01:06.652
Worship.

01:06.687 --> 01:08.827
Here! Take it!

01:08.861 --> 01:11.623
Thanks, darling.
You're a lifesaver.

01:11.657 --> 01:14.384
It's all thanks
to our new fragrance.

01:14.419 --> 01:16.076
Worship.

01:16.110 --> 01:20.908
Come on, Barbie!
We've got shopping to do!

01:20.942 --> 01:22.737
"Dateline Townsville!"

01:22.772 --> 01:24.256
The Fashionistas
are at it again!

01:24.291 --> 01:27.087
Their latest shoplifting
spree of rare and valuable items

01:27.121 --> 01:30.228
has made them Townsville's most
fashionable and most wanted.

01:30.262 --> 01:32.575
The vile and wicked
Fashionistas are...

01:32.609 --> 01:36.751
-Worship.
-...just the greatest!

01:38.615 --> 01:40.030
Be careful with those.

01:40.065 --> 01:42.343
I don't want any wrinkly money.

01:42.378 --> 01:46.485
So...the Fashionistas are up
to their old tricks.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.935
Why am I not surprised?

01:47.969 --> 01:49.592
I'm always surprised!

01:49.626 --> 01:52.112
Wow! Look!
It's a truck!

01:52.146 --> 01:53.941
Why try to stop us,
Powerpuff Girls,

01:53.975 --> 01:56.633
when you'd rather
help us instead?!

01:56.668 --> 01:58.532
What is that
supposed to do?

01:58.566 --> 02:00.189
Worship.

02:00.223 --> 02:04.331
Make us get you all the rubies
in Townsville.

02:04.814 --> 02:08.127
Thanks,
Tackypuff Girls!

02:08.162 --> 02:09.370
Ta-ta!

02:10.854 --> 02:13.719
Ah. It always feels good
to help people.

02:13.754 --> 02:15.618
It sure does!

02:15.652 --> 02:18.138
Come on, girls.
Let's go home.

02:23.557 --> 02:24.627
-Wait!
-Oh!

02:24.661 --> 02:26.353
What did we just do?!

02:26.387 --> 02:27.699
Yeah, wait a minute.

02:27.733 --> 02:31.047
Did we just help
the Fashionistas rob people?

02:31.081 --> 02:32.013
Oh, no!

02:32.048 --> 02:34.326
We've become
too helpful!

02:34.361 --> 02:37.053
I don't think we meant
to help them, Bubbles.

02:37.087 --> 02:39.159
I think it was
that perfume.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.713
Smelling it must
temporarily hypnotize people

02:41.747 --> 02:42.817
to do their bidding.

02:42.852 --> 02:44.198
Aw, great.

02:44.233 --> 02:46.649
What do we do now,
cut off our noses?!

02:46.683 --> 02:49.514
But my face will
look terrible without one!

02:49.548 --> 02:53.069
And we'll never know where to
put our fake mustaches!

02:53.103 --> 02:55.658
No, I don't think
we have to go that far.

02:55.692 --> 02:57.384
I have an idea.

02:57.418 --> 02:59.317
Let's go!

02:59.351 --> 03:01.767
Welcome to
the Shoegenheim Museum.

03:01.802 --> 03:06.738
Our next piece is the crown
jewel of the entire collection.

03:06.772 --> 03:09.189
These one-of-a-kind
glass slippers

03:09.223 --> 03:12.502
belonged to Cinderella's...

03:12.537 --> 03:15.333
horse -- Melvin!

03:15.367 --> 03:17.680
Ahhh!

03:17.714 --> 03:19.337
Ah, yes.

03:19.371 --> 03:21.546
Magnificent, aren't they?

03:21.580 --> 03:23.237
Oh!

03:23.272 --> 03:26.689
Yes! But they'll look
even better on us!

03:26.723 --> 03:28.035
No, please!

03:28.069 --> 03:29.968
We can't afford
another robbery!

03:30.002 --> 03:33.420
We're on
a shoe-string budget!

03:35.456 --> 03:36.906
Please!

03:36.940 --> 03:38.701
Worship.

03:38.735 --> 03:39.909
Take them!

03:39.943 --> 03:43.464
They're only
priceless antiques!

03:43.499 --> 03:46.640
So this is what it's like
to have a "sole" mate!

03:46.674 --> 03:49.746
Stop right there, Fashionistas!

03:49.781 --> 03:52.577
And don't even
think about trying to spray us

03:52.611 --> 03:56.926
with that weird perfume,
'cause we got nose plugs,

03:56.960 --> 03:58.755
so we can't smell nothin'!

03:58.790 --> 04:01.827
And I put
nose plugs in my ears, too,

04:01.862 --> 04:04.278
so I can't hear anything!

04:04.313 --> 04:06.970
Bubbles, you didn't
need to do that.

04:07.005 --> 04:10.077
Yes,
I do like cats!

04:10.111 --> 04:12.631
Looks like we can't stop
the Tackypuff Girls

04:12.666 --> 04:13.770
with our perfume.

04:13.805 --> 04:16.325
But I bet they can!

04:16.358 --> 04:18.084
Worship.

04:18.119 --> 04:20.915
You heard the Fashionistas!
Get 'em!

04:22.538 --> 04:25.334
"Dateline Townsville!"
This just in --

04:25.368 --> 04:27.439
the Fashionistas are
headed toward Townsville

04:27.474 --> 04:30.028
in their fashionable blimp,
the Bikini Bomber.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.271
Apparently it is loaded

04:31.305 --> 04:32.962
with their signature scent,
Worship.

04:32.996 --> 04:35.482
Rumor has it they're
going to spray our citizens,

04:35.516 --> 04:38.588
turning them into slaves
of fashion forever.

04:38.623 --> 04:40.970
When reached for comment,
the Fashionistas said,

04:41.004 --> 04:44.698
"Muaha-ha-ha-ha-ha -- ha."

04:45.492 --> 04:48.495
This is
the worst day ever!

04:48.529 --> 04:50.945
Worse than that time
we fought the sludgebeast

04:50.980 --> 04:52.188
at the vomitorium?

04:52.222 --> 04:55.329
Hmm. Okay,
second-worst day ever.

04:55.364 --> 04:58.298
There must be some way
to neutralize that perfume!

04:58.332 --> 04:59.816
We need help.

04:59.851 --> 05:01.956
I'm sorry,
Powerpuff Girls.

05:01.991 --> 05:04.787
I simply cannot help you
defeat the Fashionistas.

05:04.821 --> 05:06.996
Don't even bother
asking again.

05:07.030 --> 05:08.549
You won't change my mind.

05:08.584 --> 05:11.000
Um, have we met?

05:11.034 --> 05:13.520
I told myself,
"Nostrilla Dupont,

05:13.554 --> 05:16.039
you simply cannot help
the Powerpuff Girls

05:16.074 --> 05:17.627
stop the Fashionistas.

05:17.662 --> 05:21.148
Yes, you may be the finest
perfumer in the world,

05:21.182 --> 05:25.152
but even your olfactory
genius cannot help them."

05:25.186 --> 05:27.085
Dude,
who is this person?

05:27.119 --> 05:29.639
I don't know,
but she smells nice.

05:29.674 --> 05:31.745
Nice?!
Nice?

05:31.779 --> 05:35.196
What you are smelling
is sandalwood and hazelmist,

05:35.231 --> 05:37.095
mixed with a hint of freesia,

05:37.129 --> 05:40.478
and combined into
the finest perfume imaginable!

05:40.512 --> 05:42.065
That is not nice.

05:42.100 --> 05:45.379
That's divine!

05:45.414 --> 05:47.485
Divine.

05:47.519 --> 05:50.280
And that is what I called
it until the Fashionistas

05:50.315 --> 05:53.353
stole my formula
and twisted it into this

05:53.387 --> 05:56.045
gauche mind-control
perfume of theirs.

05:56.079 --> 05:57.943
So you can
help us stop them?!

05:57.978 --> 06:00.394
I don't do "stop."

06:00.429 --> 06:02.776
I simply cannot help you.
Don't even bother to beg.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.881
It's impossible to even try.

06:04.916 --> 06:06.607
Well...

06:06.642 --> 06:08.506
Okay,
then I guess we --

06:08.540 --> 06:09.748
Fine, I'll do it.

06:09.783 --> 06:12.026
Now, we don't have
a lot of time if we're going

06:12.061 --> 06:14.270
to make a perfume
strong enough to counteract

06:14.304 --> 06:15.927
the Fashionistas' creation.

06:15.961 --> 06:18.930
So we'll have to do it...

06:18.964 --> 06:21.381
with style.

06:22.658 --> 06:25.074
What is fragrance?

06:25.108 --> 06:27.525
Is it the lion's roar?

06:29.250 --> 06:32.909
Or is it our
most glorious selves?

06:35.636 --> 06:36.810
Ah!

06:36.844 --> 06:38.225
Shh!

06:39.468 --> 06:42.436
These have always
brought me luck.

06:46.095 --> 06:49.995
Luck? Is that
where passion evolves?

06:50.030 --> 06:54.552
My tuba rings
only of what is true.

07:01.006 --> 07:02.732
Non!

07:08.669 --> 07:11.914
Disgust...

07:11.948 --> 07:13.433
What just happened?

07:13.467 --> 07:16.436
Did anyone else's brain go
all artsy-fartsy for a minute?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.438
I think
I met an elephant.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.924
What we did was make
my finest creation yet!

07:21.958 --> 07:22.959
Oh, let me smell!

07:26.480 --> 07:27.930
One sniff of that

07:27.964 --> 07:31.174
will cause anyone to be
disgusted with the Fashionistas!

07:31.209 --> 07:33.591
Great!
Do you girls still need me,

07:33.625 --> 07:34.971
or can I towel off?

07:35.006 --> 07:36.835
You are excused,
Professor.

07:36.870 --> 07:38.354
Terrific!

07:38.388 --> 07:43.393
Okay, girls,
let's get disgusting!

07:49.848 --> 07:51.609
Okay, they're flying
the blimp.

07:51.643 --> 07:53.127
Now's our chance.

07:53.162 --> 07:54.404
There's the vat!

07:54.439 --> 07:56.476
We just have to get
the vial in there,

07:56.510 --> 07:57.649
and it will stop
Townsville

07:57.684 --> 07:59.651
from worshipping
the Fashionistas!

07:59.686 --> 08:03.344
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the Tackypuff Girls!

08:03.379 --> 08:06.071
Hmm? But you're
flying the blimp!

08:07.659 --> 08:10.386
A fashionable
femme fatale always has

08:10.420 --> 08:12.733
an equally
fashionable autopilot.

08:12.768 --> 08:15.184
Approaching
Townsville center.

08:15.218 --> 08:18.498
T-minus one minute
until perfumigation.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.707
Let's get
to the vat!

08:20.741 --> 08:24.055
Not so fast!

08:26.575 --> 08:27.507
Worship.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.509
Fight it, girls!

08:29.543 --> 08:34.099
You weren't going to ruin Barbie
and my big day now, were you?

08:36.619 --> 08:37.827
No way!

08:37.861 --> 08:39.864
You're the best, Bianca!

08:39.898 --> 08:42.004
Yeah, barbarous.

08:42.038 --> 08:43.557
Big fan!

08:44.696 --> 08:46.111
Big fan!

08:46.146 --> 08:48.666
Biggest fan
right here!

08:50.702 --> 08:51.876
That's better.

08:51.910 --> 08:55.189
Perfumigation
in 20 seconds.

08:55.224 --> 08:57.847
Whoa, sweet blimp!

08:57.882 --> 09:01.230
Oh, it's
so fashionable!

09:01.264 --> 09:03.577
Now give us
that vial.

09:03.612 --> 09:05.199
Uhhhh...

09:05.234 --> 09:08.271
Perfumigation
in 10 seconds.

09:08.306 --> 09:10.791
Bubbles, the vial!

09:12.482 --> 09:14.105
Now!

09:14.139 --> 09:16.072
Yes, that's right...

09:16.107 --> 09:18.868
Do what's best
for us, darling.

09:18.903 --> 09:21.561
What's best for you?

09:21.595 --> 09:23.183
Okay!

09:25.185 --> 09:26.738
No!

09:29.327 --> 09:31.743
Disgust.

09:31.778 --> 09:32.813
-What?!
-Huh?

09:32.848 --> 09:35.644
Commencing perfumigation.

09:37.266 --> 09:40.614
Well, after a visit from
the Fashionistas earlier,

09:40.649 --> 09:44.722
I apparently declared today
Fashionistas' Day.

09:44.756 --> 09:47.448
So, we're here to...

09:47.483 --> 09:49.934
kick them out of Townsville!

09:49.968 --> 09:51.591
Let's get 'em!

09:53.109 --> 09:55.940
Yeah!

09:57.666 --> 09:58.805
What did you do?!

09:58.839 --> 10:01.980
What's best for you --
just like you said!

10:02.015 --> 10:05.743
What's best for you is what will
make you a better person.

10:07.676 --> 10:11.438
Right, Barbie, that is
the literal interpretation.

10:11.472 --> 10:14.441
But nice try,
Powerpoops!

10:14.475 --> 10:18.134
As long as we're in the sky,
we're safe.

10:22.138 --> 10:25.107
"Dateline Townsville!"
After the Fashionistas' blimp

10:25.141 --> 10:27.937
collided with a radio tower,
they managed to escape

10:27.972 --> 10:29.629
by well-matched parachutes,

10:29.663 --> 10:31.631
only to land in
the heart of Townsville,

10:31.665 --> 10:33.218
where an angry mob was waiting.

10:33.253 --> 10:35.117
And, boy, were they angry!

10:35.151 --> 10:36.843
Let's get 'em!

10:36.877 --> 10:38.810
They're disgusting!

10:38.845 --> 10:40.640
And we're angry!

10:41.917 --> 10:44.540
The Fashionistas
were run out of town,

10:44.574 --> 10:47.785
and their current whereabouts
are unknown.

10:47.819 --> 10:51.202
And the day is saved
by Nostrilla Dupont!

10:51.236 --> 10:52.410
Aaah!

10:52.444 --> 10:53.653
What are you still
doing here?!

10:53.687 --> 10:55.655
Oh, I, uh...

10:55.689 --> 10:57.898
Smoke bomb!

10:59.555 --> 11:01.591
Oh. I thought
youwould leave.
