04:50.320 --> 04:52.142
Hey, sorry. I'm here alone.

04:52.513 --> 04:54.194
- Would you like coffee?
- That'd be great.

04:54.304 --> 04:56.627
- I'd like a hot tea.
- Okay.

04:57.528 --> 04:59.560
This is so really bad.

05:00.090 --> 05:00.791
It's fine.

05:00.792 --> 05:03.333
This is the grossest place
I've ever seen in my life.

05:03.454 --> 05:05.004
- It's fine.
- It's dirty.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.447
It's local.

05:07.978 --> 05:10.620
Mom, you said we need to leave at 11.

05:10.621 --> 05:12.813
I know, honey.
But Agnes isn't here yet.

05:13.343 --> 05:16.567
We have to wait for her, sweetie.
I promise, we're gonna leave soon.

05:22.002 --> 05:24.013
What is that like the third time this week?

05:24.014 --> 05:25.696
Next time it's going out of your paycheck.

05:26.046 --> 05:27.967
Dale, where's my eggs over?

05:27.968 --> 05:31.472
- Right here. You said up.
- I said easy.

05:32.122 --> 05:34.434
- Give me 5 minutes.
- Well, I don't have 5 minutes.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.076
- I got to get out of here.
- Jeez.

05:38.198 --> 05:39.339
Okay, darling.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.280
How about you colored it up
for your mother.

05:41.281 --> 05:42.282
Okay.

05:42.983 --> 05:44.244
I'll get it later.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.652
- Crawfish Friday?
- Crawfish are good.

05:51.722 --> 05:55.486
Just peel the tail back
and suck all the juice out the head.

05:55.776 --> 05:58.337
- You suck juice out of the head?
- Yeah.

05:58.338 --> 06:00.501
- What?
- Yeah, you just...

06:03.994 --> 06:08.008
Okay. Here's a Belgian waffle and bacon.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.471
Where the hash browns?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.894
- You ordered bacon.
- I want it hash browns.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.716
- Okay, I can get you that. No problem.
- No, he's fine.

06:16.717 --> 06:19.378
- You ordered bacon.
- I want it hash browns.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.531
Come on.

06:20.701 --> 06:23.504
Tyler, eat. He's fine.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.876
- Okay. Short stack with eggs.
- That's grandma's.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.958
Mom, breakfast!

06:28.198 --> 06:31.402
I can't eat now. I just took my pills.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.223
You know what, you can have
grandma's potatoes.

06:33.233 --> 06:34.405
I don't want hers.

06:34.555 --> 06:36.606
Tyler, knock it off.

06:36.607 --> 06:38.588
Okay, egg white omelet for you.

06:38.589 --> 06:40.651
- Honey.
- Yes, ma'am?

06:40.881 --> 06:43.012
You remind me of my daughter.

06:43.013 --> 06:47.207
- Doesn't she look like Stephanie?
- Mom, I'm your daughter. Stephanie.

06:47.237 --> 06:48.569
I'm your daughter.

06:50.180 --> 06:53.904
- Tabasco?
- Okay, I'll get your Tabasco.

06:54.865 --> 06:56.487
And your eggs will be right up, sir.

06:58.098 --> 07:00.651
- Where's Agnes, Bill?
- Late?

07:00.841 --> 07:03.483
- You trying to be funny?
- No, she's not answering her phone.

07:03.484 --> 07:06.015
She might have overslept.
Can you do a double?

07:06.016 --> 07:08.629
Can't, I got plans with my kid.
Call Alan.

07:14.575 --> 07:16.707
Okay, hot coffee.

07:18.178 --> 07:21.121
No, no, no. I would like
herbal tea, please.

07:23.544 --> 07:26.046
Okay, I'll get you an herbal tea.

07:26.126 --> 07:28.939
- Did you guys get menus?
- No, but we'd like some.

07:29.179 --> 07:31.851
- Claire.
- What? Like we're supposed to guess?

07:31.852 --> 07:34.435
- I'll be right back.
- Do your job.

07:36.026 --> 07:38.098
Okay, I'm so sorry about that.
Here you go.

07:38.569 --> 07:40.120
Silverware.

07:41.031 --> 07:43.553
- Is everybody good here now?
- He's sulking.

07:43.554 --> 07:45.115
I am not.

07:45.916 --> 07:47.947
You know what, can you just
bring us side hash browns?

07:47.948 --> 07:50.561
- Burnt on the edges.
- Burnt on the edges, coming up.

07:50.631 --> 07:51.781
- We're good.
- Okay.

07:51.782 --> 07:53.474
Still waiting on my eggs.

07:54.294 --> 07:56.185
Right. Your eggs are coming right up.

07:56.186 --> 07:57.707
Yeah, and can I actually get...

07:57.708 --> 08:00.246
Can I switch to wheat toast
instead of white toast, is that alright?

08:00.270 --> 08:02.131
Yeah, wheat instead of white.
Yep, got it.

08:02.132 --> 08:03.753
- Thank you.
- Be right back.

08:03.754 --> 08:06.315
New side of hash browns,
burnt on the edges.

08:06.316 --> 08:07.748
Copy.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.040
Miss!

08:12.793 --> 08:13.824
Don't yell.

08:14.174 --> 08:15.105
Miss!

08:15.106 --> 08:17.017
- Please stop yelling.
- Shut up.

08:18.849 --> 08:19.859
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

08:19.860 --> 08:22.763
But Karla's kid sitting here waiting
for her to take him to the park.

08:24.144 --> 08:26.036
Yeah, so you can come in?

08:26.176 --> 08:27.808
So come in.

08:29.289 --> 08:30.681
Here you go.

08:30.991 --> 08:36.746
All the herbal tea you could
possibly want and two menus.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.010
Is your oatmeal steel?

08:41.241 --> 08:43.273
- What?
- Cut.

08:43.424 --> 08:47.157
- Are your oats steel-cut?
- No, they're Quaker.

08:51.101 --> 08:53.332
- Should I come back...
- No, no.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.395
Oatmeal with...

08:55.816 --> 08:57.818
I'll take with with reduced fat almond.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.401
Oh, let me guess,
you only have wholemeal?

09:01.402 --> 09:03.272
- From the Outer?
- No, from AMP.

09:03.273 --> 09:06.256
Why don't I just apply it
directly to my thighs?

09:07.017 --> 09:08.639
You could use some help.

09:11.762 --> 09:13.484
Karla, go ahead and go.

09:13.634 --> 09:15.936
- Really?
- Yeah. Dale found Agnes.

09:16.196 --> 09:18.938
- She should be here in 15 minutes.
- Awesome.

09:18.939 --> 09:22.022
- Who wants to go to the park?
- I am!

09:23.814 --> 09:25.215
Let's go.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.287
Mommy, your turn.

11:01.472 --> 11:03.514
Is daddy coming to the fair?

11:04.094 --> 11:06.937
No, sweetheart.
You're gonna see daddy next weekend.

11:07.307 --> 11:09.860
And maybe you'll get to see Cheryl too.

11:12.242 --> 11:13.844
Do you like Cheryl?

11:16.557 --> 11:20.030
- I don't know.
- I think she's nice, Frankie.

11:20.441 --> 11:23.823
And she's smart.
She's very smart.

11:23.824 --> 11:27.688
- She's gonna be a doctor.
- Yeah, I know.

11:28.649 --> 11:31.250
And I want you to really
make friends with her, okay?

11:31.251 --> 11:32.683
Are you friends with her?

11:33.634 --> 11:34.765
Yeah.

11:35.115 --> 11:36.315
Yeah, I am.

11:36.316 --> 11:40.100
She, daddy and I,
we all love somebody like crazy.

11:40.350 --> 11:43.614
- Do you know who that is?
- Me!

11:43.704 --> 11:45.385
You!

11:48.539 --> 11:49.800
You.

11:51.171 --> 11:53.173
We all love you.

12:23.193 --> 12:24.974
Mommy, can I get ice cream?

12:24.975 --> 12:28.007
You know what, how about
we check out all of our options first...

12:28.008 --> 12:29.410
and then maybe we'll come back.

12:29.710 --> 12:31.522
- Okay? Come on.
- Okay.

12:47.658 --> 12:49.349
Can I get my face painted?

12:49.369 --> 12:51.411
How about we wait until
the line is a little shorter?

12:51.412 --> 12:52.593
We'll come back, okay?

13:05.275 --> 13:08.699
- Marco.
- Polo.

13:09.640 --> 13:12.673
- How old your boy?
- Six.

13:13.383 --> 13:15.395
He obviously likes to hide.

13:25.696 --> 13:27.087
Marco.

13:28.018 --> 13:30.380
Oh, Marco.

13:30.971 --> 13:32.633
Oh, no.

13:33.183 --> 13:36.567
Am I lost my little Frankie forever?

13:37.448 --> 13:39.520
Where could he be?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.842
There you are.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.245
Come on, let's go see the show.

14:05.085 --> 14:06.957
Can I get my face painted now?

14:07.558 --> 14:10.000
Yeah, as soon as this song is over,
okay sweetheart?

14:13.073 --> 14:15.274
Frankie, I'm gonna need
my phone for one second.

14:15.275 --> 14:16.947
There you go. Let's switch.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.178
Hello?

14:19.940 --> 14:20.941
Yeah.

14:21.782 --> 14:23.814
Can you hold on just one second?

14:24.254 --> 14:25.555
Okay. Frankie, listen.

14:25.556 --> 14:28.298
I'm gonna have to go over there
and take this phone call, okay?

14:28.328 --> 14:31.191
It's really important.
Don't move, okay?

14:31.301 --> 14:33.584
- Marco.
- Polo.

14:34.815 --> 14:36.046
Don't move.

14:37.117 --> 14:39.179
Okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

14:42.372 --> 14:43.824
He wants what?

14:45.856 --> 14:47.818
Primary custody?

14:49.870 --> 14:52.563
Well, he can't have that.
I mean, can he?

14:55.255 --> 14:58.969
My batteries are gonna die, Mr. Jackson.
If it does, I'll call you back, okay?

14:59.470 --> 15:01.712
- Marco.
- Polo.

15:02.823 --> 15:04.314
I'm sorry. What?

15:05.125 --> 15:07.848
I can't hear you. Say that again.

15:09.049 --> 15:14.174
Yes, yes, I have a job.
I have a regular job. Yes.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.358
Is that even gonna matter to the court?

15:19.770 --> 15:22.011
Well, yeah, he's in real estate.

15:22.012 --> 15:26.577
And his girlfriend is a pediatrician
and I'm a waitress.

15:26.647 --> 15:28.838
So you do the math. Marco.

15:28.839 --> 15:30.411
Polo.

15:32.553 --> 15:34.685
Let me tell you something, Mr. Jackson.

15:35.345 --> 15:39.650
If he thinks that he's gonna take
my son away from me just because...

15:50.881 --> 15:52.352
Frankie.

15:53.514 --> 15:54.905
Frankie.

15:58.899 --> 16:00.100
Frankie.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.182
Excuse me, ma'am.

16:02.183 --> 16:04.385
Did you see where my little boy was
that was right here?

16:04.645 --> 16:06.787
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

16:08.459 --> 16:10.120
Marco.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.364
Oh, Marco!

16:15.295 --> 16:17.257
Are you hiding, Frankie?

16:20.501 --> 16:22.022
Marco.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.346
Marco!

16:32.212 --> 16:35.606
Frankie. You left your toy.

16:38.348 --> 16:40.481
Are you hiding, Frankie?

16:42.553 --> 16:43.954
Marco.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.026
Frankie.

16:46.236 --> 16:49.398
- You can't find your son?
- No, I can't find him.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.680
- I don't know where he is.
- Okay.

16:50.681 --> 16:53.352
There's a security office
overpass the restaurant.

16:53.353 --> 16:54.864
Okay, great, great. Thank you.

16:54.865 --> 16:56.005
Marco!

16:56.006 --> 16:59.158
Has anybody seen a little boy
with short curly hair?

16:59.159 --> 17:01.521
What's his name, honey?
Is it Marco or Frankie?

17:01.522 --> 17:02.473
Frankie!

17:02.474 --> 17:05.174
- Should I call the police?
- Yes, yes, call the police.

17:05.175 --> 17:06.877
Marco!

17:12.192 --> 17:14.374
No!

17:23.223 --> 17:24.494
No!

17:25.756 --> 17:28.709
Please stop!

17:29.049 --> 17:30.611
Frankie!

17:30.961 --> 17:32.122
Frankie!

17:42.282 --> 17:44.074
Hey, hey!

17:46.186 --> 17:47.287
Frankie!

17:51.552 --> 17:52.603
Frankie!

18:12.352 --> 18:13.454
Oh, God.

18:13.984 --> 18:17.628
Where the hell is my phone?
Oh, God.

18:23.424 --> 18:24.555
Wait, wait!

18:28.038 --> 18:29.139
Oh, God.

18:30.981 --> 18:32.553
Oh, God, Frankie...

18:34.505 --> 18:36.557
There you are. Oh, God.

18:44.364 --> 18:47.117
Let him out! Let him out!

18:48.248 --> 18:49.560
Stop!

18:49.780 --> 18:51.241
Frankie!

18:51.662 --> 18:52.983
Frankie!

18:58.358 --> 18:59.359
Stop!

19:00.150 --> 19:02.813
They've got my son!
They have my son!

19:03.664 --> 19:05.716
Help me! Help me!

19:11.121 --> 19:12.733
Oh, God!

19:16.567 --> 19:17.988
Oh, God.

19:49.410 --> 19:50.701
Oh, God.

19:58.769 --> 19:59.790
Where is he?

20:10.190 --> 20:11.652
Don't let me lose him.

20:13.063 --> 20:19.249
Okay, God, I know I never pray to you
unless somebody is sick.

20:20.591 --> 20:23.664
Or somebody's dying or in an airplane.

20:23.744 --> 20:27.227
But, God, please don't let me lose him.

20:28.949 --> 20:32.342
But if you get me this one thing, God...

20:32.372 --> 20:33.833
This one thing...

20:33.834 --> 20:39.660
I will never ever ask you
for another thing as long as I live.

20:42.573 --> 20:44.405
Let them be there, God.

20:46.206 --> 20:48.969
Oh, thank God.
Oh, God, thank you.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.702
Let him out!

20:52.352 --> 20:53.744
Stop!

20:54.284 --> 20:56.096
Pull over!

21:04.645 --> 21:07.698
Come on! Move!

21:08.048 --> 21:09.199
Oh, shit!

21:27.788 --> 21:29.460
Where are you, sweetheart?

If the cops asked,
I haven't seen your face.

I don't know your license plate.

36:17.207 --> 36:18.237
You can get away.

38:15.536 --> 38:17.347
You got $10,000?

38:18.779 --> 38:19.780

38:24.074 --> 38:26.216
and we're gonna go get that money.

38:27.548 --> 38:29.780
Or you're gonna kill me.

38:30.561 --> 38:32.242
That's what he wants.

38:32.623 --> 38:34.575
What he wants me to do.

38:34.875 --> 38:39.149
But I told him for $10,000,
we can make a new plan.

38:40.380 --> 38:45.496
You want your boy and I want $10,000.

38:50.971 --> 38:55.916
Karla, we have to get out of this field.
Unlock the door.

38:57.748 --> 38:58.999
No.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.823
I'm trying to save your child.

39:03.424 --> 39:07.117
Open the door before he changes his mind.

39:07.207 --> 39:10.441
Come on.
You want him to kill your son?

39:30.280 --> 39:31.662
Follow him.

39:49.890 --> 39:51.391
Where do I go?

39:51.522 --> 39:54.495
Just keep going straight,
I'll tell you where to go.

39:58.479 --> 40:01.120
After we get the money,
I'll give him a call...

40:01.121 --> 40:03.363
and you'll get your boy back.

42:15.305 --> 42:17.167
Okay. Okay.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.291

Okay.

43:50.300 --> 43:52.092
So now what's the plan?

43:55.185 --> 43:57.728
You don't really even have a plan, do you?

43:58.158 --> 44:01.270
You have no idea
what to even do right now.

44:01.271 --> 44:02.252
You need her...

44:02.253 --> 44:04.405
You need her to tell you
what to do, don't you?

45:39.640 --> 45:40.811
Shit!

49:54.334 --> 49:55.765
What happened to the people
that were in this car?

49:55.766 --> 49:56.836
They have me right
when I pulled him down.

49:56.837 --> 49:58.218
He was driving like a crazy man.

49:58.278 --> 50:01.361

- Yeah, they went down that way.

50:01.742 --> 50:03.963

51:43.664 --> 51:46.395
No, ma'am. But you can use that phone
right over on that wall.

51:46.396 --> 51:47.917
I cannot use that phone?
It's right there.

And they said that all we have to do now

That's what all these people did.

53:13.053 --> 53:14.635
They waited.

Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

57:05.826 --> 57:10.200
No! No, that's not it!
It's a black Volvo!

57:10.471 --> 57:12.332
Goddamnit!

57:12.573 --> 57:14.204
Goddamnit.

59:19.369 --> 59:22.973
No! You are not opening that door!

59:25.976 --> 59:27.658
I said no!

59:34.294 --> 59:36.156
Fuck you!

59:38.859 --> 59:40.230
No!

59:48.699 --> 59:50.260
Oh, God. No!

59:50.601 --> 59:51.602
No!

59:52.382 --> 59:55.556
No, no, no...

59:56.196 --> 59:58.138
Don't stop, don't stop.

01:01:34.975 --> 01:01:37.336
- I need help!
- Are you alright?

01:01:37.337 --> 01:01:39.459
- Do you have a phone?
- I got a radio.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.912
Call 911.
My son has been kidnapped!

01:01:42.423 --> 01:01:45.685
- Call 911.
- Okay, but I got to go this way.

01:01:45.686 --> 01:01:48.087
- I don't get a reception over here.
- But they went that way!

01:01:48.088 --> 01:01:49.850
That way is a dead end.

01:01:51.011 --> 01:01:53.332
Dead end? What do you mean?

01:01:53.333 --> 01:01:54.465
Look out!

01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:52.953
Damnit! Where's my shells?

01:04:35.746 --> 01:04:37.738
You had to keep coming, didn't you?

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:51.482
Where's my son?

01:05:53.063 --> 01:05:55.235
Where's my son!

01:06:27.167 --> 01:06:30.451
Terrence Vicky? Is that who you are?

01:06:32.232 --> 01:06:33.564
Were.

01:06:34.334 --> 01:06:38.719
125, Route 77.

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:40.551
Okay.

01:06:41.652 --> 01:06:42.763
Let's see.

01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:52.682
<i>Continue on route 77 for 2 miles.</i>

01:06:52.683 --> 01:06:55.446
<i>Your destination will be on the left.</i>

01:11:23.183 --> 01:11:24.405
Hello?

01:11:26.386 --> 01:11:27.948
He ain't here.

01:11:29.399 --> 01:11:33.804
Yes, we got another one
and now everything is gone to shit!

01:11:37.057 --> 01:11:42.112
Okay, then the price just doubled
because this mother has become a problem.

01:11:44.995 --> 01:11:49.219
I told you Terry ain't here.
I had to hitch a ride back.

01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:53.874
He's out taking care of the problem.

01:11:55.966 --> 01:11:59.138
Just remember,
you are just the middleman.

01:11:59.139 --> 01:12:02.302
It'll be a $100,000 or you get nothing.

01:12:57.868 --> 01:13:00.149
<i>911 operator, what's your emergency?</i>

01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:01.412
I need help.

01:13:05.045 --> 01:13:06.046
<i>Ma'am?</i>

01:13:06.657 --> 01:13:08.899
<i>Ma'am, are you there? Ma'am?</i>

01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:11.481
<i>Ma'am, we're here with you.</i>

01:13:11.482 --> 01:13:13.633
<i>We're keeping the line open,
we're gonna get you some help.</i>

01:13:13.634 --> 01:13:14.804
<i>Do not hang up.</i>

01:13:14.805 --> 01:13:17.408
<i>I'm gonna place you on hold
while we triangulate your location.</i>

01:13:17.478 --> 01:13:19.269
<i>I'll be right back with you.</i>

01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:46.526
<i>Ma'am, I'm back. Is it safe to talk?</i>

01:13:46.527 --> 01:13:49.470
- What is your emergency?
- My son has been kidnapped.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.012
And I'm in the house where I think
they're keeping him.

01:13:52.102 --> 01:13:54.624
<i>We think we found you.
Can you verified your address?</i>

01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:56.907
Yes. 125, route 77.

01:13:57.207 --> 01:14:00.080
<i>And do you know if there's anyone else
in the house with you, ma'am?</i>

01:14:01.281 --> 01:14:02.682
I don't know, I'm not sure, but...

01:14:02.683 --> 01:14:06.946
But the woman that took him is out
in a barn or some house.

01:14:06.947 --> 01:14:08.017
It's near where I am.

01:14:08.018 --> 01:14:09.799
<i>I've already contacted
the dispatch officers.</i>

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.801
<i>They're on the way.</i>

01:14:10.931 --> 01:14:12.812
<i>You need to find a safe place
to wait until they're arrive.</i>

01:14:12.813 --> 01:14:14.834
Okay. How long is that gonna take?

01:14:14.835 --> 01:14:15.786
<i>They'll be there very soon.</i>

01:14:15.787 --> 01:14:17.787
<i>I just need you to stay
on the line with me, okay?</i>

01:14:17.788 --> 01:14:18.509
Okay.

01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:21.951
- Is that gonna be like 5 minutes?
- Between 7-15 minutes, ma'am.

01:14:21.952 --> 01:14:24.404
Oh, God, 15 minutes...
That's a long time.

01:14:24.405 --> 01:14:26.235
<i>It's alright, ma'am.
The police are on their way.</i>

01:14:26.236 --> 01:14:29.960
<i>I need you to get to a safe place,
stay here on the line with me now, okay?</i>

01:14:32.443 --> 01:14:34.865
<i>Would you let me know when
you find a safe place to hide?</i>

01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:37.327
<i>Ma'am, are you there?</i>

01:14:37.928 --> 01:14:40.881
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- Hang up, hang up.

01:14:42.513 --> 01:14:43.564
Oh, God.

01:14:50.421 --> 01:14:51.522
Terry!

01:14:53.994 --> 01:14:56.216
Terry, are you back?

01:14:58.138 --> 01:15:00.701
Terry, was that you on the phone?

01:15:03.043 --> 01:15:04.044
Terry!

01:15:23.163 --> 01:15:24.475
Terry!

01:16:18.789 --> 01:16:19.850
Frankie.

01:17:48.348 --> 01:17:49.349
Frankie?

01:17:54.785 --> 01:17:56.146
<i>Mommy?</i>

01:17:57.117 --> 01:17:58.118
Frankie?

01:17:59.169 --> 01:18:00.561
<i>Mommy?</i>

01:18:00.951 --> 01:18:02.783
Where are you, sweetheart?

01:18:03.003 --> 01:18:04.334
Frankie.

01:18:05.215 --> 01:18:07.808
- Where are you, honey?
- Up here.

01:18:08.949 --> 01:18:11.622
Mommy, mommy.

01:18:11.942 --> 01:18:13.573
- Hi, sweetheart.
- I'm scared.

01:18:13.574 --> 01:18:15.715
- Where have you been?
- Yes, I'm gonna get you down.

01:18:15.716 --> 01:18:17.287
I'm gonna get you down, honey.

01:18:17.347 --> 01:18:19.490
<i>Are you the police?</i>

01:18:21.542 --> 01:18:22.672
What is that, Frankie?

01:18:22.673 --> 01:18:26.026
- I'm Lucy.
- I'm Libby.

01:18:26.316 --> 01:18:27.998
Oh my God, there's...

01:18:28.028 --> 01:18:29.800
There's three of you up there.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.762
- Mommy, give me a help.
- Okay, honey, look...

01:18:32.763 --> 01:18:35.035
I'm gonna get you down, okay?

01:18:35.546 --> 01:18:37.777
- Come up the ladder.
- I can't.

01:18:37.778 --> 01:18:40.751
I can't, honey,
because the ladder is locked.

01:18:41.181 --> 01:18:44.995
So you're gonna have to come down
through this hole.

01:18:45.105 --> 01:18:47.266
But first I'm gonna have to get...
No, no, Frankie, don't.

01:18:47.267 --> 01:18:50.560
No, don't put your legs down, honey.
You can't fit through there.

01:18:50.561 --> 01:18:53.843
- No, just wait a second.
- Grab me.

01:18:53.844 --> 01:18:57.236
Put your legs up, Frankie,
so mommy can hit with the shovel.

01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:59.630
- Put your legs...
- Grab me.

01:19:02.963 --> 01:19:06.806
Okay, Frankie, listen.
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

01:19:06.807 --> 01:19:09.620
- No, mommy, wait!
- You wait right there.

01:19:23.564 --> 01:19:26.806
Frankie, Frankie, put your legs
back up in that hole, okay?

01:19:26.807 --> 01:19:27.824
We're gonna have to go fast.

01:19:27.848 --> 01:19:30.319
Get your legs back up in that hole,
Frankie, right now!

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.362
- Mommy, mommy...
- Frankie!

01:19:53.874 --> 01:19:56.517
Okay. Okay, come on, Frankie.
Come on.

01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:11.961
- Come on, girls. Come on.
- No, I'm scared.

01:20:11.962 --> 01:20:14.895
- Come on, you have to come down.
- I want my mommy.

01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:18.439
Okay, okay, okay.

01:20:18.489 --> 01:20:21.100
We're gonna play the quiet game, okay?

01:20:21.101 --> 01:20:24.173
I need both of you to be very quiet,
don't make a sound, okay?

01:20:24.174 --> 01:20:27.287
I'm gonna come back.
I'm gonna come back for you, okay?

01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:31.682
Go get her! Get her!

01:20:33.143 --> 01:20:34.144
Come on.

01:20:35.355 --> 01:20:36.356
Come on.

01:20:41.852 --> 01:20:44.565
Okay, Frankie, we're gonna have to hide.

01:24:35.476 --> 01:24:37.297
You sit right here, okay?

01:24:38.429 --> 01:24:40.421
I'm gonna go get the girls, okay?

01:24:40.791 --> 01:24:42.312
We'll get them out of here.

01:24:44.565 --> 01:24:47.988
Hi, you guys, I'm back.

01:24:48.368 --> 01:24:51.501
- Come on, it's time to come down now.
- I want my mommy.

01:24:51.502 --> 01:24:53.193
It's okay, sweetheart.
Come on down.

01:24:53.343 --> 01:24:56.006
Come on, honey. I'm here to help you.
It's okay.

01:24:59.189 --> 01:25:00.951
What the hell is going on here?

01:25:01.261 --> 01:25:02.873
Who the hell are you?

01:25:05.476 --> 01:25:07.366
- Who are you?
- I live next door.

01:25:07.367 --> 01:25:08.909
I heard gunshots.

01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:11.221
Where's Margo?

01:25:12.973 --> 01:25:15.496
- In the water.
- What?

01:25:15.536 --> 01:25:16.737
Yeah.

01:25:17.598 --> 01:25:19.620
She and her husband kidnapped my son.

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:23.273
I've lived next to the Vicky's
for 14 years.

01:25:24.535 --> 01:25:26.537
They ain't kidnappers.
You turn around.

01:25:31.412 --> 01:25:32.953
I called the police, you know.

01:25:34.885 --> 01:25:39.239
- Who's up there?
- Those are kids. More abducted kids.

01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:42.803
Yeah, they're up there in that hole.

01:25:46.997 --> 01:25:48.419
Dear Lord.

01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:51.261
We have to get them down.

01:25:52.132 --> 01:25:53.363
Hey, you two.

01:25:53.874 --> 01:25:56.306
We're gonna get you down
from there right now.

01:25:56.356 --> 01:26:00.470
- I wanna go home!
- We are gonna go home right now.

01:26:00.471 --> 01:26:01.872
Both of you.

01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:05.155
Just come to the opening.

01:26:05.656 --> 01:26:07.197
Come on, girls.

01:26:07.768 --> 01:26:08.839
Come on.

01:26:09.269 --> 01:26:11.842
Wait a minute.
I never told you how many.

01:26:14.224 --> 01:26:16.807
And I never told you they were girls.

01:26:32.092 --> 01:26:34.865
You took the wrong kid.

01:26:55.766 --> 01:26:57.518
Oh, sweetheart...

01:27:51.542 --> 01:27:54.033
<i>This is Julian Buescher with
an unbelievable story...</i>

01:27:54.034 --> 01:27:56.166

<i>After what police called it
an unprecedented civilian pursuit.</i>

01:28:04.475 --> 01:28:08.498
<i>Amazingly, the mother got into her
own vehicle and chase the suspects.</i>

01:28:08.499 --> 01:28:10.209
