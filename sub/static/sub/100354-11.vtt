THE VERY FIRST NIGHT, WE BOTH
FELT IT.

10:19.152 --> 10:24.691
>> LIKE, HE JUST MEANS SO MUCH
TO ME.

10:24.691 --> 10:27.260
AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY, LIKE,
I'M HAPPY TO BE PART OF THIS

10:27.260 --> 10:30.363
EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF
HIM, BECAUSE I'M PROUD TO BE A

10:30.363 --> 10:30.964
PART OF HIM, AND BE WITH HIM.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.734
LIKE, I'M PROUD OF HIM AND THE
PERSON HE IS.

10:34.734 --> 10:38.138
AND THIS IS, LIKE, REAL FOR ME.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.073
YEAH.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.709
>> LOOK AT THAT.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.276
>> I SEE YOU AND ME IN THEM.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.712
I DO.

10:45.712 --> 10:48.781
I SEE YOUR DAD AND MYSELF.

10:48.781 --> 10:49.849
30 YEARS AGO.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.251
>> A LITTLE YOUNGER.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.687
[LAUGHTER]
>> I SAID 30 YEARS AGO.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.790
HANNAH ANN IS ABSOLUTELY
BREATHTAKINGLY GORGEOUS.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.660
SEEMS LIKE A SWEET GIRL, LOVELY
GIRL.

11:00.660 --> 11:05.999
BUT PETER FALLS SO HARD, AND I
HAVE TO TELL YOU, THAT WAS A

11:05.999 --> 11:10.303
HUGE CONCERN OF MINE.

11:10.303 --> 11:16.176
>> I'M JUST ‐‐ I'M SO THANKFUL
FOR THIS ONE, AND JUST OUR

11:16.176 --> 11:16.743
RELATIONSHIP TO THIS POINT.

11:16.743 --> 11:17.710
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TALK A
LITTLE BIT?

11:17.710 --> 11:18.244
>> YEAH.

11:18.244 --> 11:18.978
YEAH, LET'S GO TALK.

11:18.978 --> 11:19.445
>> OKAY.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.080
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
HANNAH ANN IS THE RIGHT GIRL.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.383
I JUST WANT HIM TO BE HAPPY.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.519
>> SO I DON'T KNOW YOU, I'VE
NEVER MET YOU BEFORE, I DON'T

11:26.519 --> 11:30.823
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE THAT IS

11:30.823 --> 11:34.394
GOING TO LOVE MY SON WITH ALL OF
HER HEART AND BE THERE FOR HIM

11:34.394 --> 11:38.932
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE PURE
HAPPINESS IN HIS LIFE.

11:38.932 --> 11:43.169
I WANT TO SEE, YOU KNOW, I
DON'T ‐‐ I ALWAYS THINK IT'S

11:43.169 --> 11:45.038
IMPORTANT YOU NEVER TO CHANGE
HIM AND HE NEVER TO CHANGE YOU.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.439
>> BUT GROW EACH OTHER.

11:46.439 --> 11:51.177
>> BUT GROW EACH OTHER AND MAKE
EACH OTHER BETTER.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.178
>> YEAH.

11:52.178 --> 11:56.082
>> WOULD YOU FIT INTO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

11:56.082 --> 11:56.449
>> MM‐HMM.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.116
ABSOLUTELY.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.052
FOR ME, IN THE PAST I'VE HAD
CONNECTIONS WITH DIFFERENT

11:59.052 --> 12:00.720
PEOPLE BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN JUST HAVING A CONNECTION

12:00.720 --> 12:02.322
WITH SOMEONE AND HAVING A
CONNECTION WITH THE FUTURE.

12:02.322 --> 12:06.392
FOR YOU, OUT OF ANYTHING THAT
GOES ON TODAY, I WANT YOU TO

12:06.392 --> 12:10.129
KNOW THAT, LIKE, HOW MUCH I DO
LOVE YOUR SON.

12:10.129 --> 12:15.034
AND FOR ME, LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S
BEEN THE HARDEST PROCESS FOR ME

12:15.034 --> 12:19.539
TO, LIKE, NOT EXACTLY GET THAT
IN RETURN.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.975
YOU KNOW, THIS COULD BE, LIKE,
OUR LAST WEEK TOGETHER.

12:21.975 --> 12:25.311
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WOULD
RATHER BE ALL IN, SAY HOW I

12:25.311 --> 12:28.948
FEEL, BE COMPLETELY PRESENT THAN
HOLD BACK AND BE CLOSED OFF.

12:28.948 --> 12:31.451
>> LET'S NOT TALK NEGATIVE
THINGS, LET'S JUST TALK

12:31.451 --> 12:33.052
POSITIVE.

12:33.052 --> 12:35.288
THE LITTLE TIME THAT I'VE SPENT
WITH YOU AND HOW MUCH YOU'VE

12:35.288 --> 12:42.729
SHOWN ME THAT YOU LOVE MY SON,
IT'S THE WORLD TO ME.

12:42.729 --> 12:43.263
SO...

12:43.263 --> 12:43.863
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

12:43.863 --> 12:44.564
THIS IS JUST AMAZING.

12:44.564 --> 12:45.265
ALL RIGHT.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.933
>> HANNAH ANN IS JUST SO LOVING
AND CARING.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.535
I CAN FEEL THE LOVE THAT SHE HAS
FOR MY SON, AND THAT SPEAKS

12:49.535 --> 12:51.838
VOLUMES TO ME.

12:51.838 --> 12:54.307
JUST, IT'S THE BEST FEELING A
MOTHER CAN HAVE.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.577
>> SO, EXCITING DAY.

12:57.577 --> 13:01.547
>> YEAH, IT'S AN EXCITING BUT
REALLY IMPORTANT DAY.

13:01.547 --> 13:09.889
>> I'VE GOT TO SAY, I WAS A
LITTLE APPREHENSIVE, YOU KNOW,

13:09.889 --> 13:13.293
LEADING UP TO THIS, I MEAN, YOU
KNOW, BECAUSE HE WENT THROUGH

13:13.293 --> 13:14.227
THIS PROCESS AND HAD HIS HEART
BROKEN.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.161
THAT IS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY,
RIGHT?

13:15.161 --> 13:16.929
>> I AM TAKING THIS AS SERIOUS
AS IT COULD POSSIBLY BE.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.665
THIS IS MORE THAN JUST FEELINGS.

13:18.665 --> 13:21.634
THIS IS A FUTURE.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.905
AND KNOWING THAT THIS COULD BE
OUR LAST WEEK TOGETHER, I KNOW

13:25.905 --> 13:27.240
THAT I'VE GIVEN IT MY ALL, AND
HE'S GIVEN ME THE GIFT OF, YOU

13:27.240 --> 13:29.642
KNOW, WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO LOVE
SOMEONE.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.011
>> THAT'S WONDERFUL.

13:32.011 --> 13:34.414
VERY NICELY SAID.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.682
>> I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF I
WASN'T SINCERE ABOUT IT.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.850
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.

13:37.850 --> 13:42.188
>> WHEN I LOOK AT PETER, I LOOK
AT MY HEART.

13:42.188 --> 13:43.556
>> OKAY.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.257
>> HE'S MY PARTNER.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.560
AND, LIKE, WE LAUGH TOGETHER, I
WILL BE HAPPY WITH THEM, BUT

13:47.560 --> 13:48.861
ALSO, LIKE, WE WILL CRY
TOGETHER.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.931
>> YOU SEEM LIKE YOU ARE
EXTREMELY COMPATIBLE AND IN THE

13:51.931 --> 13:54.867
SHORT TIME THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU,
THAT IS VERY REASSURING TO ME.

13:54.867 --> 14:00.106
>> IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.

14:00.106 --> 14:02.608
AND I'VE TOLD HIM THAT, BUT,
THAT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY, BUT IT

14:02.608 --> 14:06.612
IS SO TRUE AND PEOPLE DON'T ‐‐
>> OH, I BELIEVE IN THAT.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.915
>> THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH IT.

14:08.915 --> 14:11.617
>> I WAS A LITTLE BIT
APPREHENSIVE ABOUT HOW THIS

14:11.617 --> 14:14.787
MEETING WAS GOING TO GO BECAUSE
OBVIOUSLY, PETER HAD HIS HEART

14:14.787 --> 14:18.224
BROKEN, BUT HANNAH ANN WAS
EXPLAINING TO ME HOW MUCH SHE

14:18.224 --> 14:21.461
CARED FOR PETER.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.262
>> WELL, IT WAS GREAT TALKING TO
YOU.

14:23.262 --> 14:24.163
>> I KNOW, IT WAS SO GOOD
TALKING TO YOU.

14:24.163 --> 14:29.869
>> AND I COULD SEE WHAT A
GENUINE PERSON AND GOOD‐HEARTED

14:29.869 --> 14:31.337
PERSON SHE WAS, BUT THERE'S
ANOTHER PERSON IN THE PICTURE,

14:31.337 --> 14:33.439
AND I JUST WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR
PETER.

14:33.439 --> 14:33.974
>> SO, JUST TALKED WITH HANNAH.

14:33.974 --> 14:34.307
>> YEAH?

14:34.307 --> 14:35.808
HOW DID THAT GO?

14:35.808 --> 14:42.115
>> SHE IS JUST A REMARKABLE
YOUNG LADY.

14:42.115 --> 14:47.787
I MEAN, SHE'S TOTALLY OUT THERE.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.021
SHE PUTS IT OUT THERE.

14:49.021 --> 14:49.956
SHE'S REALLY INTO YOU.

14:49.956 --> 14:50.456
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT.

14:50.456 --> 14:51.924
>> NO, YEAH.

14:51.924 --> 14:53.092
>> SO, WITH HANNAH, IS THERE
ANYTHING THAT YOU FEEL YOU ARE

14:53.092 --> 14:53.459
LACKING WITH HER?

14:53.459 --> 14:54.427
>> NO.

14:54.427 --> 14:57.363
THERE IS TRULY NOTHING THERE
THAT I'M LACKING.

14:57.363 --> 15:00.666
I PROMISE YOU, THERE IS NOTHING.

15:00.666 --> 15:04.771
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING OR ANY TYPE
OF HESITATION WITH ME, IT'S THIS

15:04.771 --> 15:06.739
DILEMMA THAT I'M INEVITABLY END
BECAUSE MY HEART IS WITH TWO

15:06.739 --> 15:10.943
PEOPLE RIGHT NOW AND THAT IS
WHAT IT IS.

15:10.943 --> 15:15.047
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EITHER
ME NOT BEING AS CRAZY INTO MADI

15:15.047 --> 15:18.351
OR NOT AS CRAZY INTO HANNAH ANN.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.087
AT THE END THAT I AM TRULY
IN LOVE WITH THEM.

15:21.087 --> 15:25.391
>> SO DO YOU SEE YOURSELF
LEANING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER?

15:25.391 --> 15:34.967
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK...

15:34.967 --> 15:41.641
>> WHAT ARE YOU CONFLICTED
ABOUT, BUD?

15:41.641 --> 15:45.678
>> I MEAN, I THINK I JUST NEED
THAT TIME WITH MADISON TO REALLY

15:45.678 --> 15:48.748
JUST BE ABLE TO TALK, BECAUSE I
SEE WHAT I HAVE WITH HANNAH ANN.

15:48.748 --> 15:49.949
IT'S JUST THAT MY HEART IS WITH
MADI AS WELL.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.551
LIKE, THEY BOTH HAVE IT.

15:51.551 --> 15:55.621
SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO GIVE MY HEART TO TWO

15:55.621 --> 15:58.391
DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND I HAVE ONE
THAT'S MAKING IT EASIER ON ME

15:58.391 --> 16:10.503
AND ONE THAT'S MAKING IT NOT SO
EASY.

16:10.503 --> 16:19.812
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GOING TO DO THIS.

16:19.812 --> 16:28.588
>> IT'LL COME.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.556
YOU KNOW THAT WE LOVE YOU, BUD,
AND WE ONLY WANT THE BEST FOR

16:30.556 --> 16:31.624
YOU.

16:31.624 --> 16:41.100
BUT THIS IS A BIG DECISION.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.568
>> [EXHALES]
>> PETER IS REALLY TORN.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.070
I HATED TO SEE HIM SO SAD LIKE
THAT, YOU KNOW.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.906
>> BYE.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.441
>> IT WAS SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.475
>> I KNOW.

16:49.475 --> 16:50.209
SO WONDERFUL.

16:50.209 --> 16:54.247
>> I FEEL LIKE I'VE KNOWN YOU
ALL MY LIFE.

16:54.247 --> 16:54.780
>> AW, THAT MEANS SO MUCH.

16:54.780 --> 16:58.284
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.952
>> I REALLY ENJOYED GETTING TO
INTRODUCE HANNAH ANN TO MY

16:59.952 --> 17:01.220
FAMILY.

17:01.220 --> 17:05.525
I KNEW THAT MY FAMILY WOULD
ABSOLUTELY ADORE HER AND THEY

17:05.525 --> 17:07.994
COULD FOR SURE SEE HER BECOMING
PART OF OUR FAMILY.

17:07.994 --> 17:10.062
>> THANK YOU FOR BEING SO
AMAZING.

17:10.062 --> 17:13.165
>> I DO LOVE YOU.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.267
I DO.

17:14.267 --> 17:18.170
AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY
IT, I'M NOT AFRAID TO SHOW IT.

17:18.170 --> 17:23.109
AND, LIKE, I JUST WANTED THEM TO
KNOW THAT AND FEEL IT.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.711
>> I LOVE HANNAH ANN.

17:25.711 --> 17:26.913
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT
WHERE I STAND WITH HANNAH ANN

17:26.913 --> 17:30.316
AND WHERE SHE IS WITH ME.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.485
>> ALL RIGHT.

17:32.485 --> 17:37.324
>> BUT I HAVE TWO WOMEN RIGHT
NOW, AND I'M GOING TO SEE MADI

17:37.324 --> 17:37.657
TOMORROW.

17:37.657 --> 17:41.160
I JUST AM REALLY, REALLY
CONFUSED WITH MADI ON A LOT OF

17:41.160 --> 17:44.931
DIFFERENT THINGS.

17:44.931 --> 17:48.167
IT'S JUST A LOT OF KIND OF
UNKNOWN RIGHT NOW, AND A LOT OF

17:48.167 --> 17:52.138
ANXIETY THAT I'M FEELING WITH IT
GOING INTO IT.

17:52.138 --> 17:55.975
AND TO SEE HER INTERACT WITH MY
FAMILY, I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S

17:55.975 --> 18:04.050
GOING TO GO, SO...

18:04.050 --> 18:05.952
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]

18:23.169 --> 18:30.109
>> WELCOME BACK TO OUR
"BACHELOR" LIVE 2‐NIGHT FINALE.

18:30.109 --> 18:36.515
HE AND HIS FAMILY MET
HANNAH ANN, AND THEY LOVED HER.

18:36.515 --> 18:39.619
MADISON'S ULTIMATUM IS OUT THERE
IN THE OPEN WITH PETER'S FAMILY,

18:39.619 --> 18:44.824
AND WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO WATCH
A SOMETHING SO DIFFERENT, SO

18:44.824 --> 18:47.960
EMOTIONAL, YOU REALLY HAVE TO
SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT.

18:47.960 --> 18:59.138
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

18:59.138 --> 19:04.076
♪
>> YESTERDAY I HAD A GREAT DAY

19:04.076 --> 19:04.443
WITH HANNAH ANN.

19:04.443 --> 19:05.978
IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MY PERSON

19:05.978 --> 19:07.413
AND MY FAMILY, AND I KNOW
WITHOUT A DOUBT I HAVE THAT WITH

19:07.413 --> 19:11.717
HANNAH ANN.

19:11.717 --> 19:15.588
I THINK FOR MADISON TODAY,
THEY'RE DEFINITELY CONCERNED.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.823
FOR MY HEART AND FOR ME AT THE
END OF THIS.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.159
AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE'VE HAD TO
GO THROUGH SOME STUFF RECENTLY

19:20.159 --> 19:24.697
THAT HAS JUST PUT US BACK A
LITTLE BIT.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.866
BUT DEFINITELY IT WAS A BIG
RELIEF FOR ME AT THE LAST

19:26.866 --> 19:33.839
ROSE CEREMONY WHEN SHE DID
ACCEPT THE ROSE.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.742
I AM IN LOVE WITH MADI.

19:36.742 --> 19:41.147
I AM SO IN LOVE WITH MADISON,
AND FROM MY SIDE, I WANT TO DO

19:41.147 --> 19:49.555
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE THIS
WORK.

19:49.555 --> 19:50.523
>> HI.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.993
>> HI.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.429
WOW.

19:56.429 --> 20:00.833
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

20:00.833 --> 20:07.306
>> NOT GOOD.

20:07.306 --> 20:12.211
I WALKED AWAY FROM OUR LAST
CONVERSATION AT DINNER REALLY

20:12.211 --> 20:17.049
FRUSTRATED AND REALLY HURT.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.819
THIS IS YOUR JOURNEY AND YOU ARE
A BIG BOY AND YOU CAN MAKE

20:19.819 --> 20:22.788
DECISIONS FOR YOURSELF, BUT I
DID WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE

20:22.788 --> 20:25.291
WEIGHT AND THE GRAVITY OF THE
IMPORTANCE OF THAT WEEK FOR ME,

20:25.291 --> 20:28.994
AND, LIKE, WHAT I WAS OKAY WITH
AND WHAT I WASN'T OKAY WITH.

20:28.994 --> 20:33.165
AND UP UNTIL THAT POINT, LIKE, I
HADN'T ASKED YOU FOR ANYTHING.

20:33.165 --> 20:36.302
I'D ONLY FOCUSED ON OUR
RELATIONSHIP.

20:36.302 --> 20:41.941
LIKE, I HAD DEFENDED YOU AND
TRUSTED YOU AND BEEN THERE FOR

20:41.941 --> 20:44.243
YOU, AND I JUST FELT LIKE, IN
THAT MOMENT, THAT WAS ME SHARING

20:44.243 --> 20:45.978
MY HEART.

20:45.978 --> 20:49.448
AND I FELT LIKE YOU REALLY JUST
PUT YOUR FEELINGS AND YOUR NEEDS

20:49.448 --> 20:57.356
AND YOUR WANTS, LIKE, WAY ABOVE
MINE, AND, LIKE, THAT WAS REALLY

20:57.356 --> 20:59.291
HURTFUL.

20:59.291 --> 21:02.161
LIKE, THAT DAY WAS, LIKE,
LITERALLY THE BEST DAY EVER AND,

21:02.161 --> 21:05.798
LIKE, I LITERALLY LOOKED INTO
YOUR EYES AND I WAS LIKE, IF HE

21:05.798 --> 21:07.833
GETS DOWN ON ONE KNEE RIGHT NOW,
I'M SAYING YES.

21:07.833 --> 21:10.870
LIKE, I WANT TO SPEND THE REST
OF MY LIFE WITH HIM.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.405
AND THAT NIGHT, I JUST FELT
LIKE, IT JUST, LIKE ‐‐ IT WAS

21:13.405 --> 21:26.018
LIKE THE RUG WAS TAKEN.

21:26.018 --> 21:29.889
>> MADI, LIKE, I KNOW THAT I'VE
HURT YOU IN A LOT OF WAYS AND

21:29.889 --> 21:33.125
I'M SO SORRY.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.795
AND, LIKE, I TOTALLY GET ‐‐ I
TOTALLY GET WHERE YOU'RE COMING

21:35.795 --> 21:37.930
FROM AND WHY THIS IS SO
DIFFICULT FOR YOU AND WHY IT

21:37.930 --> 21:38.397
MEANS SO MUCH.

21:38.397 --> 21:41.066
I'M JUST BEING STRAIGHT BLUNT
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW, AND MAYBE

21:41.066 --> 21:43.135
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS, BUT
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON THAT I

21:43.135 --> 21:45.437
TRULY DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW YOU
FEEL.

21:45.437 --> 21:48.908

FOR ME AND FOR MY PARTNER TO

33:27.706 --> 33:28.874

REALISTICALLY SEE YOURSELF

34:30.502 --> 34:31.636
DOING?

THAT.

34:33.672 --> 34:34.072

SPIRITUAL LIKE I AM VERY

36:26.985 --> 36:29.721

IT WOULD BE FOR YOU TO HAVE

LEVEL OF FAITH, BECAUSE IT'S

CHANGE HIM, BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE

IS AND WE LOVE HIM THE WAY HE
IS.

THE FANTASY SUITE BECAUSE I WAS
YOU, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

THERE ARE OTHER GIRLS THAT HE

37:15.333 --> 37:16.768
HAS VERY STRONG FEELINGS FOR,
WHETHER HE WANTS TO GET PHYSICAL

37:16.768 --> 37:20.071
WITH THEM OR EMOTIONAL, THAT'S
UP TO HIM.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.308
SO THAT ‐‐
>> RIGHT, BUT ALSO AT THE SAME

HIS JOURNEY, BUT IT'S ALSO MINE.

HAVE.

ASK YOURSELF, IS IT WORTH IT?
