WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:04.303
ADULT ADAM: <i> If you were a girl</i>
<i> growing up in the '80s,</i>

00:04.305 --> 00:08.007
<i> the pajama party was a night</i>
<i> of epic adventure.</i>

00:08.009 --> 00:08.640
Okay, listen up.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.309
This next decision is, like,
super important.

00:10.311 --> 00:13.145
Okay. Do we watch
<i> Adventures In Babysitting,</i>

00:13.147 --> 00:16.248
<i> Pretty in Pink,</i>
or <i> Troop Beverly Hills?</i>

00:16.250 --> 00:17.383
ALL: <i> Troop Beverly Hills</i>

00:17.385 --> 00:18.250
I was hoping you'd say that!

00:18.252 --> 00:21.720
Shelley Long
has a black belt
in shopping!

00:21.722 --> 00:22.855
It's very funny to me.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.324
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.
This is so fun.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.859
I love you all so much!

00:26.861 --> 00:28.494
(ALL SQUEAL)

00:28.496 --> 00:31.363
<i> ¶ Come on down</i>
<i> It's cookie time</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:32.464
ALL:
<i> ¶ It's cookie time ¶</i>

00:32.466 --> 00:35.200
ADULT ADAM:
Troop Beverly Hills <i> was</i>
<i> the ultimate girl cult movie.</i>

00:35.202 --> 00:39.204
<i> It had it all, songs,</i>
<i> shopping, and Shelley Long.</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:41.140
<i> ¶ It's cookie time</i>

00:41.142 --> 00:42.641
<i> ¶ It's cookie time ¶</i>

00:42.643 --> 00:43.742
ADULT ADAM:
<i> My mom loved it, too,</i>

00:43.744 --> 00:45.778
<i> because the girls</i>
<i> were still young enough</i>

00:45.780 --> 00:47.379
<i> to let her join the troop.</i>

00:47.381 --> 00:48.547
<i> And even though</i>
<i> Erica and her gal pals</i>

00:48.549 --> 00:52.284
<i> got older and cooler,</i>
<i> they never left their</i>
<i> favorite tradition behind.</i>

00:52.286 --> 00:55.621
Just heard
Mark McGonagall's throwing
a Rager Saturday night.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.689
He lets the girls
do keg stands first.

00:57.691 --> 00:58.524
He's such a gentleman.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.659
Or we do our annual
pajama party, make s'mores,

01:00.661 --> 01:03.595
and recite every word
of <i> Troop Beverly Hills.</i>

01:03.597 --> 01:04.163
Ugh, so lame.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.831
You know you're dying
to do it.

01:05.833 --> 01:06.398
I am. Yay!

01:06.400 --> 01:07.800
Oh, my God,
this is gonna be so fun!

01:07.802 --> 01:10.135
Oh, my God,
this is gonna be so fun!

01:10.137 --> 01:12.805
No!
Take off the mom pajamas

01:12.807 --> 01:13.906
and stop doing
what you're doing.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.741
Please let me be
your Shelley Long!

01:15.743 --> 01:17.476
We'll call it <i> Troop Beverly,</i>
just like in the old days.

01:17.478 --> 01:20.979
That's when we were too young
to know how unbearably
annoying you were.

01:20.981 --> 01:24.083
No offense taken.
But come on.

01:24.085 --> 01:26.819
Your pajama parties are
the only reminder I have

01:26.821 --> 01:28.754
of when you were
happy, tiny girls

01:28.756 --> 01:31.356
and not Godforsaken
teenage monsters.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.224
Look at me, Mom!

01:32.226 --> 01:34.793
There is no
<i> Troop Beverly</i> anymore.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.495
End of story.

01:37.031 --> 01:37.763
Dude, did you hear that?

01:37.765 --> 01:40.866
Your sister's having
her hot friends over
for a lingerie party.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.468
Pretty sure
I heard "pajama."

01:42.470 --> 01:43.535
Bet they're gonna have
pillow fights,

01:43.537 --> 01:46.305
tickle fights,
and other fights
we can't even imagine!

01:46.307 --> 01:47.606
Easy, Dave Kim.
That's my sister.

01:47.608 --> 01:51.777
We can hide your
video camera when
they're having their party.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.045
Yes!
Oh, my God!

01:53.047 --> 01:53.912
Again, that's my sister.

01:53.914 --> 01:57.015
Dude, this is our one chance
to peek behind the curtain

01:57.017 --> 01:59.551
and gain insight
into young womanhood.

01:59.553 --> 02:00.953
Well, on one hand,

02:00.955 --> 02:03.622
it's an unforgivable
invasion of privacy.

02:03.624 --> 02:07.993
On the other hand,
girls are a perplexing
mystery,

02:07.995 --> 02:10.529
and filming them
for education purposes

02:10.531 --> 02:13.532
could provide some
helpful insight.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.067
Let's do it!

02:15.069 --> 02:15.467
Yes!

02:15.469 --> 02:18.704
Aw, man!
We're gonna be the coolest
guys in school!

02:19.507 --> 02:21.807
ADULT ADAM:
<i> We were not.</i>

02:22.877 --> 02:24.042
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:24.044 --> 02:30.115
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:30.317 --> 02:31.416
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:31.418 --> 02:35.220
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:35.222 --> 02:37.556
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was November 11th,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:37.558 --> 02:39.258
<i> and Barry and Pops</i>
<i> just discovered</i>

02:39.260 --> 02:42.628
<i> Willow Grove Mall</i>
<i> had a new store.</i>

02:42.730 --> 02:44.329
Holy crap, puppies!

02:44.331 --> 02:46.598
They're so fluffy
and adorable!

02:46.600 --> 02:47.699
They're like the kittens
of dogs!

02:47.701 --> 02:52.104
Look! That one's falling
asleep while standing up.

02:52.106 --> 02:53.305
I've done that.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.339
Oh, not so fast.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.208
Look, I don't want to sound
like your father,

02:56.210 --> 02:57.809
but you can't
go in there.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.878
You're deathly allergic
to dogs.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.380
Ugh! Why?

03:01.382 --> 03:02.414
I know, it's rough.

03:02.416 --> 03:07.085
But I'll be at your side
in solidarity.

03:07.087 --> 03:08.220
Oooh...

03:08.222 --> 03:10.422
That fuzzy one
just sneezed.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.390
I'll see you in 10.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.858
ADULT ADAM: <i> My brother's</i>
<i> violent dog allergy</i>

03:12.860 --> 03:15.127
<i> had always been a source</i>
<i> of great frustration.</i>

03:15.129 --> 03:18.997
<i> But that day,</i>
<i> the lure of cute,</i>
<i> cuddly puppies</i>

03:18.999 --> 03:20.499
<i> was too much for Barry.</i>

03:20.501 --> 03:21.867
There's nothing
to worry about.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.203
This thin mesh barrier
will protect me.

03:24.205 --> 03:27.539
ADULT ADAM:
<i> But as Barry stared down</i>
<i> into that pit of adorableness,</i>

03:27.541 --> 03:30.509
<i> he lost his balance</i>
<i> and tumbled into furry danger.</i>

03:30.511 --> 03:33.278
Oh, God, no!
Not puppies!

03:33.280 --> 03:34.613
Hold your breath, Barry!

03:34.615 --> 03:36.348
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna die!

03:36.350 --> 03:38.250
They're so cute,
but deadly!

03:38.252 --> 03:39.184
They're gonna kill me!

03:39.186 --> 03:43.822
Uh, kiddo,
you seem totally fine.

03:43.824 --> 03:44.990
You're right. I am!

03:44.992 --> 03:48.627
Get on in here, you!
I'm the puppy king!

03:49.730 --> 03:52.331
Dad!
You won't believe it.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.133
I'm alive!
I'm actually alive!

03:55.135 --> 03:55.867
Ask your mother.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.869
I spent
the entire afternoon

03:57.871 --> 03:59.171
in a puppy pit
cheating death.

03:59.173 --> 04:02.107
You always said the reason
we can't get a dog
is 'cause of me.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.443
Forget what happened
in the puppy pit.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.244
That was a fluke.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.646
You are crazy allergic
to dogs.
Wrong!

04:07.648 --> 04:10.215
My insanely strong
immune system

04:10.217 --> 04:10.983
has grown so powerful

04:10.985 --> 04:13.118
that I'm no longer allergic
to anything on earth.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.387
No. Stop.
Don't think that.

04:15.389 --> 04:15.921
It's the truth!

04:15.923 --> 04:18.991
I'll go outside right now
and roll in poison oak.
You'll see.

04:18.993 --> 04:20.425
I made it up, okay?

04:20.427 --> 04:21.927
You're not allergic to dogs.
What?

04:21.929 --> 04:24.997
The only reason I said that is
because when you were a kid,

04:24.999 --> 04:27.633
you asked for one
every damn day!

04:27.635 --> 04:29.001
Do you realize
you've denied me

04:29.003 --> 04:30.802
the sidekick I've always
longed for?

04:30.804 --> 04:32.404
I'm okay with that.
Do you know how many times

04:32.406 --> 04:34.573
I had to play Frisbee
by myself?

04:34.575 --> 04:36.041
How many times I got caught
in a well?

04:36.043 --> 04:37.909
Look, I got enough
ungrateful kids

04:37.911 --> 04:38.710
around here
to take care of.

04:38.712 --> 04:42.180
The last thing I need
is an ungrateful animal
to take care of.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.415
Get me a dog.
No.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.249
Get me a dog!
No!

04:44.251 --> 04:46.151
I'm gonna keep saying
it until I get

04:46.153 --> 04:48.320
the four-legged friend
I deserve!

04:48.322 --> 04:50.155
Give me a dog!
No! Stop asking.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.056
It's not gonna happen.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.524
Give me a dog.
No.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.659
Give me a dog.
No.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.559
Give me a dog.
No.

04:54.561 --> 04:55.727
Give me a dog.
No.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.296
Give me a dog.
No.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.263
Give me a dog.
No.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.598
Give me a dog.
No.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.133
Give me a dog.
No.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.467
Give me a dog.
No.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.568
Give me a dog.
No.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.671
Give me a dog.
Fine!

05:05.673 --> 05:09.374
But if I say yes, promise me
you'll take care of it.

05:09.376 --> 05:10.609
It's your dog.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.076
Yes!

05:11.078 --> 05:12.411
Now I'm not
the only one in the house

05:12.413 --> 05:14.980
who has to take his pill
in cheese!

05:14.982 --> 05:17.182
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While Barry finally got</i>
<i> his wish for a dog,</i>

05:17.184 --> 05:20.819
<i> me and my crew were getting</i>
<i> our greatest wish.</i>

05:20.821 --> 05:22.654
<i> Thanks to cutting-edge</i>
<i> VHS technology,</i>

05:22.656 --> 05:26.858
<i> we would learn the secrets</i>
<i> of womanhood.</i>

05:27.861 --> 05:32.931
Okay. I just snuck
a cable from the bedroom
to the basement.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.866
Fingers crossed, boys.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.803
Oh! Yes!

05:37.805 --> 05:39.538
(CHEERING)

05:40.307 --> 05:42.541
Okay, enough!
Silence!

05:42.609 --> 05:44.676
Dave Kim
needs to focus.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.113
It's happening.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.682
Today we learn the secrets
of womanhood.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.718
This is the best moment
of my life.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.318
I love you guys.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.354
<i> ¶ We're the girls</i>
<i> from</i> Beverly Hills

05:55.356 --> 05:56.722
<i> ¶ One, two, three, four</i>

05:56.724 --> 05:58.890
<i> ¶ Shopping is</i>
<i> our greatest skill ¶</i>

05:58.892 --> 05:59.524
(LAUGHTER)

05:59.526 --> 06:01.360
What the hell?
They're just watching
a dumb movie.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.295
Come of age already,
damn it!

06:03.297 --> 06:05.297
Hit each other
with pillows!

06:05.299 --> 06:08.233
Okay, who wants pizza ro...
Oh, my God!

06:08.235 --> 06:10.502
What is happening here?
(GASPS)

06:10.504 --> 06:13.605
Okay, I can totally
explain this.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.639
Run!

06:14.641 --> 06:15.907
You're grounded, Adam!

06:15.909 --> 06:18.043
And I'm calling your mothers!

06:18.045 --> 06:19.711
GIRL: <i> Oooh!</i>

06:19.713 --> 06:20.545
<i> Pbht!</i>
(LAUGHTER)

06:20.547 --> 06:24.116
ADULT ADAM: <i> In that moment,</i>
<i> my mother realized</i>
<i> she had found a way</i>

06:24.118 --> 06:27.219
<i> into Erica's pajama party,</i>
<i> and into her life.</i>

06:27.221 --> 06:28.754
Oooh...

06:28.756 --> 06:30.288
I'll just watch
for a little bit.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.823
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And she couldn't resist.</i>

06:31.825 --> 06:34.926
<i> Should I do a loose crimp or</i>
<i> a tighter, more intense one?</i>

06:34.928 --> 06:36.395
Tight crimp.
Tight crimp.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.930
<i> Loose.</i>
Yeah, no, whatever.

06:38.932 --> 06:39.431
Loose is good.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.533
ADULT ADAM: <i> That night,</i>
<i> my mom had the time</i>
<i> of her life</i>

06:41.535 --> 06:43.068
<i> being a secret member</i>
<i> of Erica's troop.</i>

06:43.070 --> 06:45.604
<i> ...three different girls,</i>
<i> and then he broke up</i>
<i> with Heather.</i>

06:45.606 --> 06:46.972
Heather G or Heather S?

06:46.974 --> 06:48.340
<i> Hello, principal ball.</i>

06:48.342 --> 06:49.941
<i> This is your</i>
<i> butt doctor calling.</i>

06:49.943 --> 06:53.412
<i> We found a problem.</i>
<i> Your head was up there.</i>

06:53.414 --> 06:54.679
(LAUGHS)

06:54.681 --> 06:55.280
Tell him he's bald!

06:55.282 --> 06:58.984
<i> So, if you add a white line</i>
<i> across the top,</i>
<i> it's a French manicure.</i>

06:58.986 --> 07:02.621
Well, don't I just look like
Zsa Zsa Gabor.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.055
Shi-shi frou-frou.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.824
<i> Um, Erica?</i>

07:06.226 --> 07:08.260
<i> What's that?</i>

07:08.829 --> 07:10.195
Oh... (BLEEP)

07:10.197 --> 07:12.264
<i> Someone's dead!</i>

07:13.267 --> 07:14.800
Ow!

07:14.802 --> 07:16.868
Ow. Fudgy,
fudgy, fudge!

07:16.870 --> 07:17.869
Fudgy, fudge...

07:17.871 --> 07:21.072
Are you spying
on our pajama party?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.674
Before you say anything,
I got to know,

07:22.676 --> 07:23.608
is it Heather G
or Heather S?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.644
I don't even know
what to say!

07:25.646 --> 07:28.947
You have never,
ever stooped so low!

07:28.949 --> 07:32.184
I have.
You just haven't caught me.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.486
Shut up and listen.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.455
I've narrowed down
the exact breed of dog

07:36.457 --> 07:39.791
that best matches
my personality
and lifestyle.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.559
Good morning to you, too.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.328
Our dog will either
be the kind that looks
like a sheep...

07:43.330 --> 07:44.796
Sheepdog.
A <i> Cujo...</i>

07:44.798 --> 07:46.731
Book, not a breed.
A McGruff...

07:46.733 --> 07:48.500
That's a cartoon
crime dog.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.702
Or a bear
crossed with a poodle.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.204
ADAM: Not possible.

07:52.206 --> 07:53.338
Surprise, surprise!

07:53.340 --> 07:55.140
Look who's back
from the dog pound!

07:55.142 --> 07:57.742
Whoa, whoa, wait!
You got a dog without me?

07:57.744 --> 07:58.710
It better be
a grizzly-poodle.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.413
Seriously.
If it's not a grizzoodle,
I don't want it.

08:01.415 --> 08:02.247
MURRAY: It's this thing.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.550
Erica, come see how sweet
and not awful I am!

08:05.552 --> 08:06.184
He's perfect!

08:06.186 --> 08:09.654
He is a she,
and you owe me 8 bucks
for shots and gas.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.622
Okay, okay.
She needs a name.

08:10.624 --> 08:15.126
From this point on,
this animal will only be known
as Jean Gog Van Damme.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.895
No, wait!
Arnold Schwarzendogger.

08:16.897 --> 08:20.398
No, wait!
Dogvester Stallone.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.567
No, wait!
Lucky.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.236
Erica, come meet Lucky.

08:24.238 --> 08:26.004
It's a perfect name,
'cause she's so lucky

08:26.006 --> 08:29.574
to live with a family
that's so loving
and forgiving.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.710
Getting a dog
doesn't change my mind

08:31.712 --> 08:32.944
that you're a garbage mom.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.246
(BABY VOICE)
But that doesn't mean

08:34.248 --> 08:38.416
I can't give this
sweetie petey some
lovey wubbies!

08:38.418 --> 08:39.651
Yes, I will!

08:39.653 --> 08:40.252
Yes, I will!

08:40.254 --> 08:42.687
Everyone's happy but me.
Seems right.

08:42.689 --> 08:46.358
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And so Barry finally got</i>
<i> his doggy sidekick.</i>

08:46.360 --> 08:47.726
<i> Or so he thought.</i>

08:47.728 --> 08:51.863
There you are, girl!
Come on!
It's time to train!

08:51.865 --> 08:54.232
I thought we'd
skip "sit" and go
to the important stuff,

08:54.234 --> 08:56.434
like how to grind some rails
and solve crimes.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.371
Will you be quiet?
I'm trying to watch the game.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.439
Just take the thing
and go.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.641
(BARKING)

09:02.643 --> 09:03.375
Whoa! Easy, girl.

09:03.377 --> 09:04.876
Maybe you should just
give her a little space.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.679
Please.
Does that look like
the face of a dog

09:07.681 --> 09:09.781
who doesn't utterly worship
her master?

09:09.783 --> 09:10.882
(GROWLING)

09:10.884 --> 09:12.717
Yeah, yeah.
He's a moron.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.586
Just settle down.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.088
Ooh.
That's nice and toasty.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.791
You know,
she's clearly tired.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.359
(GROWLING)

09:21.361 --> 09:22.127
Get some rest, Lucky.

09:22.129 --> 09:26.164
I'll teach you how to
karate chop a board
with your paws tomorrow.

09:28.201 --> 09:28.667
Toasty.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.936
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As my dad warmed up</i>
<i> to the dog,</i>

09:30.938 --> 09:32.404
<i> Erica pulled out the big guns</i>

09:32.406 --> 09:34.639
<i> and gave my mom</i>
<i> the cold shoulder.</i>

09:34.641 --> 09:36.408
There's favorite daughter.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.410
How was school, squishy?

09:38.979 --> 09:42.147
Oh, now it's the silent
treatment, huh?

09:42.149 --> 09:42.714
Fine.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.516
I'll wait for you
to come around.

09:44.518 --> 09:45.083
(DRAWER SLAMS)

09:45.085 --> 09:47.152
Okay, look, I know
what I did was wrong,

09:47.154 --> 09:47.986
but I had no choice.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.789
You completely cut me
out of your life!

09:50.791 --> 09:53.625
Invasive spy cams
are all I got.

09:53.627 --> 09:54.759
(DRAWER SLAMS)

09:54.761 --> 09:55.894
Okay,
this is ridiculous.

09:55.896 --> 09:56.795
You forgive me right now

09:56.797 --> 09:59.864
and let me hug your body
or you're grounded.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.766
Okay.
Now I'll talk.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.402
If anyone here is grounded,
it's you.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.404
You can't ground me,
I'm your mother. (SNICKERS)

10:06.406 --> 10:09.674
I just did.
You're grounded from my life.

10:09.676 --> 10:12.510
You're not allowed to
participate in it ever again.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.145
You know what,
I've had enough.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.514
You want me
out of your life?
You got it.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.350
We'll see how you
do without me for a week.

10:18.352 --> 10:20.018
You know that isn't
a punishment, right?

10:20.020 --> 10:22.687
Oh, we'll see.
And when you
come crawling back,

10:22.689 --> 10:25.056
begging for your mother's help
and guidance,

10:25.058 --> 10:27.025
we both know
what'll happen then.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.994
You'll scoop me up
in your arms.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.396
And smother you
with kisses!

10:31.398 --> 10:33.765
Deal with that, sucka!

10:37.738 --> 10:40.505
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It wasn't like my dad</i>
<i> to want a dog...</i>

10:40.507 --> 10:43.508
<i> Until he met the dog</i>
<i> that was just like him.</i>

10:43.510 --> 10:45.110
What the hell
is Lucky wearing?

10:45.112 --> 10:46.711
Did you make my dog
an Eagles jersey?

10:46.713 --> 10:49.280
Sure did.
You put effort
into something?

10:49.282 --> 10:50.448
Can you believe it?

10:50.450 --> 10:51.516
And look what
I put on the back.

10:51.518 --> 10:56.488
Instead of Jaworski,
I put "Paworski."

10:56.490 --> 10:58.289
'Cause it has paws.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.625
Because it's a dog.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.293
Not cool!

11:02.629 --> 11:03.094
(GROWLS)

11:03.096 --> 11:05.664
Dad's turned the dog
against me!

11:05.666 --> 11:07.499
This was my dream, and...

11:07.501 --> 11:08.800
Dude,
what do you got there?

11:08.802 --> 11:10.035
I'm making
a dog puppet arm

11:10.037 --> 11:12.404
for when Lucky needs to grab
stuff in my home movies.

11:12.406 --> 11:15.640
I'm gonna make
<i> Turner & Hooch,</i>
but watchable.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.307
You can't direct Lucky.

11:16.309 --> 11:19.377
Your terrible changing
voice will hurt her
sensitive dog ears.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.146
Besides, I can't even
get her away from dad

11:21.148 --> 11:23.448
to play Frisbee with me.
This is bullcrap!

11:23.450 --> 11:25.383
Dad hasn't turned Lucky
against you.

11:25.385 --> 11:28.887
The dog just listens to him
'cause he's the Alpha male.

11:28.889 --> 11:29.654
The wha?

11:29.656 --> 11:30.889
The boss.
<i> Numero uno.</i>

11:30.891 --> 11:33.992
Lucky has to follow dad.
It's nature.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.027
Nature is an idiot.

11:36.029 --> 11:36.861
I'm number <i> uno.</i>

11:36.863 --> 11:40.031
In Lucky's eyes,
you're ranked number four
in this family.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.766
No way!
Clearly dad's one.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.968
Pops is an elder,
so that makes him two.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.603
I have a power alliance
with Pops,

11:45.605 --> 11:47.405
so that puts me at three
and you at four.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.942
Four?
That's the copper medal
of the Olympics!

11:50.944 --> 11:52.277
Only one thing left to do.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.746
I shall challenge dad
to a showdown

11:54.748 --> 11:56.815
and become the Alpha!

11:57.517 --> 11:59.718
It's okay, Barry.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.253
Good Barry.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.856
Good Barry.
Good Barry.
Stop!

12:04.858 --> 12:06.157
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Barry was ready</i>
<i> to challenge my dad,</i>

12:06.159 --> 12:10.128
<i> Beverly was ready for Erica</i>
<i> to admit that a few days</i>
<i> without her were impossible.</i>

12:10.130 --> 12:14.899
And there it is,
the one thing I know
you can't resist...

12:14.901 --> 12:15.934
My seven-meat meatloaf.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.435
(CHUCKLES)
I knew you'd give in.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.471
Thanks, but I'll eat
at Lainey's.

12:19.473 --> 12:20.271
Got to study
for mid-terms.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.841
Woof, must be tough
not having your mom there

12:22.843 --> 12:24.576
to help you hit the books
this week, huh?

12:24.578 --> 12:26.010
Actually, this week's
been pretty good.

12:26.012 --> 12:28.813
Look into your heart
and tell me the truth.

12:28.815 --> 12:32.851
No, you're right.
This week's been pretty great.

12:32.853 --> 12:33.218
Stop.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.652
You haven't missed
my back scratches?
No.

12:34.654 --> 12:38.423
How I lay on your sheets
to warm them up
before bedtime?

12:38.425 --> 12:38.957
God, no.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.492
The love notes I write you
on the steamy shower door?
No.

12:40.494 --> 12:43.461
The way I suck out
the pits of your olives.
No!

12:43.463 --> 12:45.697
Just admit you learned
your lesson.

12:45.699 --> 12:47.899
Life is worse
without your mama.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.969
I'm sorry, but this week has
proven that I'm an adult

12:50.971 --> 12:53.471
and I can take care
of myself.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.405
I don't have all the facts,

12:54.407 --> 12:57.041
but I think this one goes
in the "lost" column.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.144
This is the worst thing
to happen to me

12:59.146 --> 13:01.312
since Adam
learned to walk.

13:01.581 --> 13:05.049
My God.
I can't believe how easy
it is to sneak downtown

13:05.051 --> 13:06.417
when you don't have a mom
in your life.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.753
Yeah. Mine's been gone
since I was 12.

13:08.755 --> 13:09.387
It's the best.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.790
So, where
are the tickets?
What tickets?

13:11.792 --> 13:13.124
I thought we'd buy some
from a scalper.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.226
Isn't that really,
really illegal?

13:15.228 --> 13:15.827
Definitely.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.329
Hey, dude,
you got any tickets?

13:18.698 --> 13:20.732
Yeah, 10th row center.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.200
You interested?

13:22.202 --> 13:23.434
Hells yeah we are.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.702
Hells yeah you aren't.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.704
Oh, no. Oh, God.

13:26.706 --> 13:27.872
You got ID?

13:27.874 --> 13:28.640
I do have ID?

13:28.642 --> 13:30.642
Is it a fake ID?
You know what,
just arrest us.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.110
This isn't gonna get
any better.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.478
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Erica sank to rock bottom,</i>

13:33.480 --> 13:37.081
<i> Barry was about to make his</i>
<i> move to the top of the heap.</i>

13:37.083 --> 13:39.384
Murray Terrence Goldberg,

13:39.386 --> 13:42.854
I challenge you to feats
of strength.

13:42.856 --> 13:43.488
Terrence?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.690
Do you actually think
that's my middle name?

13:45.692 --> 13:46.291
Silence!

13:46.293 --> 13:48.259
Prepare to engage
in a wrestling match

13:48.261 --> 13:51.296
so the dog can bear witness
to my true dominance.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.964
Put on this Mexican
fighting mask.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.432
No.
Then take off your shirt.

13:54.434 --> 13:58.002
I'm not gonna wrestle you
with or without clothing.

13:58.004 --> 13:58.436
Fine!

13:58.438 --> 14:00.572
Then Lucky will recognize me
as the Alpha

14:00.574 --> 14:02.807
after I launch heavy items
into the air

14:02.809 --> 14:05.276
using pure power
and brute strength.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.178
(GRUNTS)

14:07.180 --> 14:08.246
It's slipping! No!
Look away, Lucky!

14:08.248 --> 14:12.383
Why isn't this working?
I'm lifting with my back
like you're supposed to!

14:12.385 --> 14:14.219
Okay,
stop with the lifting.

14:14.221 --> 14:17.355
Look, it's not my fault
the dog hangs around me.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.923
We just get each other.

14:18.925 --> 14:20.658
Oh, my God.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.260
You love her!
I do not.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.928
There's actual love
in your heart,

14:23.930 --> 14:25.129
and you're using it
for the dog.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.231
I do not love the dog.
Fine.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.167
Then you won't care
if I return her.
Where's the receipt?

14:29.169 --> 14:32.537
She's family!
You can't return family!

14:32.539 --> 14:33.504
Believe me,
I've checked.

14:33.506 --> 14:36.374
Fine. Then from now on
her name is Traitor.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.309
Don't do that.
Come here, Traitor.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.143
Do not call her Traitor.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.946
That's a goody-woody
little Traitor.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.282
Don't use a baby voice
to call her Traitor!

14:44.284 --> 14:45.183
Then admit you love her!

14:45.185 --> 14:46.551
You know what,
we don't need this crap.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.652
Come on, Luckster.
Let's go for a walk.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.321
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Barry realized he'd been</i>
<i> replaced by a dog,</i>

14:50.323 --> 14:53.424
<i> Erica and Lainey</i>
<i> were realizing they were</i>
<i> in deep trouble.</i>

14:53.426 --> 14:57.762
(BUZZER)
You get one phone call.
Make it count.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.230
Yes. One call.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.432
No-brainer.
We're calling your mom.

15:01.434 --> 15:01.966
No way!

15:01.968 --> 15:04.235
I told her I could live
my life without her.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.837
You're in jail.
You clearly can't.

15:05.839 --> 15:08.773
It took me 16 years
to get to this position.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.108
I can't go back.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.709
Well, call someone.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.946
(PHONE RINGS)

15:14.948 --> 15:15.880
Hello?

15:15.882 --> 15:17.982
Hey. Is pops there?

15:17.984 --> 15:21.419
I'm studying, and I have
a question about World War...

15:21.421 --> 15:25.556
I or II or whatever one
he was in.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.625
(SIGHS) Hold on.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.294
Hi, sweetheart.
What's doing?

15:29.296 --> 15:32.630
I'm in major trouble
and mom will kill me,
so just act normal.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.865
Okeydokey, smokey.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.733
That doesn't sound normal.
That sounds crazy!

15:35.735 --> 15:38.202
Yessiree, sir,
indeedy-doo!

15:38.204 --> 15:39.337
Just don't talk.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.739
Okeydokey... (MUMBLES)

15:41.741 --> 15:43.274
Just come to the police
station downtown.

15:43.276 --> 15:47.812
I know you lost your license
and will need to steal a car,
but I need you.

15:47.814 --> 15:52.450
So if you'll help, just say,
"America won the war."

15:52.452 --> 15:54.953
America won the war!

15:57.223 --> 15:58.089
<i> And just like that,</i>

15:58.091 --> 16:00.925
<i> pops floored it</i>
<i> to Erica's rescue.</i>

16:04.864 --> 16:06.431
Evening, Officer.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.232
Pull over now.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.001
(HORNS HONKING)

16:10.003 --> 16:12.770
Any idea how fast
you were driving?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.038
Fifty?
Three.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.740
Fifty three?
Just three.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.108
Well,
that sounds very safe.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.243
It's not.
Can I see your license?

16:19.245 --> 16:22.947
Sure thing, Officer.
It's right down here.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.118
Kiss my grits, porky!

16:27.120 --> 16:28.619
(TIRES SPIN)

16:28.621 --> 16:30.154
(IGNITION STOPS)

16:30.156 --> 16:30.855
You're still in park.

16:30.857 --> 16:35.326
In my defense,
I haven't driven
in two years...

16:35.562 --> 16:37.662
'Cause I have no license.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.031
Pops,
thank God you're here!

16:40.033 --> 16:42.300
I'm in really big trouble,
Erica!

16:42.302 --> 16:44.268
Call your mother!

16:45.538 --> 16:47.472
<i> My sister</i>
<i> had set out to prove</i>

16:47.474 --> 16:49.540
<i> she could live life</i>
<i> without my mom.</i>

16:49.542 --> 16:51.109
<i> And she failed miserably.</i>

16:51.111 --> 16:53.277
Don't you two worry.
We'll be fine.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.514
No matter what happens,
we got each other's back.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.750
Mr. Solomon,
you're free to go.

16:58.752 --> 16:59.484
Pops out!

16:59.486 --> 17:02.086
ERICA: Mom, seriously?
What about us?

17:02.088 --> 17:03.521
Yeah, do that thing
where you scream

17:03.523 --> 17:05.456
and dig into the officer's
personal life

17:05.458 --> 17:07.425
so much
that he sets us free.

17:08.728 --> 17:09.193
(SIGHS)

17:09.195 --> 17:11.763
She only does that for people
who want her in their life.

17:11.765 --> 17:15.366
No silent treatment!
That's my thing.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.835
You know what
she wants to hear.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.037
Fine! (SIGHS)

17:19.039 --> 17:21.139
(SOFTLY)
I need you in my life.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.340
(SIGHS)
She didn't hear you.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.910
I need you in my
stupid life! Gah!

17:26.546 --> 17:27.745
She wants to know
if you mean it.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.948
You're not just saying it
because you're in prison.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.850
Sure, there's that.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.585
But you're my mom.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.554
Of course I mean it.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.195
There's no way I'm going
to the concert now, right?

17:44.197 --> 17:47.065
COP: She says, "God, no."
Right.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.234
BARRY: Hey.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.770
Mmm. Can we talk?

17:52.772 --> 17:56.674
Look, I'm no longer gonna
demand you be my sidekick.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.211
I know I'm not the Alpha
or the Beta.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.980
I'm whatever comes last
in the Greek letters.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.048
I think it's Zorbo.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.217
See, ever since
I was a little boy,

18:06.219 --> 18:07.318
I wanted a dog like you.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.053
Not 'cause
you could jet-ski

18:09.055 --> 18:12.690
or break-dance or deflect
grenades with your paws.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.891
I just wanted a friend.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.693
And I didn't have many
growing up.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.596
But I do now.
And a hot girlfriend.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.300
So I guess I don't need you
as much as I used to.

18:22.836 --> 18:26.070
But my dad, he could use
a cool friend like you.

18:26.072 --> 18:29.674
Dude's a pretty cool guy
once you get to know him.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.509
So, we cool?

18:31.511 --> 18:33.478
Right.
You can't talk.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.346
You can't talk, right?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.282
The dog can't talk, Barry.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.885
Hey, that was
a private conference

18:40.887 --> 18:42.820
between me and Traitor.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.289
Look, I'm not the Alpha.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.325
But the dog always sits
right next to you.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.392
That's because
of the scraps.

18:48.394 --> 18:53.264
There's all sorts of tasty
shrapnel flying around here.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.566
Here.
Give her a try.

18:56.970 --> 18:57.735
Whoa!

18:57.737 --> 18:59.837
She likes me!
Of course she does.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.538
You're a likeable kid.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.274
So, does this mean
we can share the dog?

19:03.276 --> 19:04.008
(SIGHS)
I don't care.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.477
Come on. Say it.
Say you love her.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.378
She's fine.
Say it!

19:07.380 --> 19:09.147
She's fine.
You love the dog.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.149
I love the dog!

19:12.118 --> 19:13.651
Me too.

19:15.088 --> 19:19.757
ADULT ADAM: <i> That day,</i>
<i> we opened our hearts to</i>
<i> a new family member.</i>

19:19.759 --> 19:23.227
<i> And Erica opened her heart</i>
<i> to my mom.</i>

19:23.229 --> 19:27.098
Smells yummy.
Since when do you bake?

19:27.100 --> 19:29.333
Just felt like cookie time.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.574
What's all this?

19:36.743 --> 19:39.510
It's hard to say.
(CHUCKLES)

19:40.713 --> 19:43.214
(VOICE BREAKING)
Even though I'm grown up

19:43.216 --> 19:45.783
and I don't need you...

19:46.619 --> 19:48.386
I still do.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.189
I always will.

19:52.158 --> 19:56.594
After everything I did,
you still bailed me out.

19:56.996 --> 19:59.697
So, I thought
I'd finally give you

19:59.699 --> 20:02.800
the pajama party
that you deserve.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.803
Oh, honey.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.406
So, what do you say?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.341
<i> Troop Beverly?</i>

20:11.778 --> 20:12.310
<i> Troop Beverly.</i>

20:12.312 --> 20:14.111
ADULT ADAM: <i> And in the end</i>
<i> it was all worth it.</i>

20:14.113 --> 20:16.414
<i> Not only did my mom and sister</i>
<i> start a new tradition,</i>

20:16.416 --> 20:20.251
<i> but my dad, Barry, and their</i>
<i> new sidekick did, too.</i>

20:20.253 --> 20:23.688
<i> Because that's what makes</i>
<i> a family great.</i>

20:23.690 --> 20:24.889
Yes!
Yes!

20:24.891 --> 20:25.523
Oh, yeah!

20:25.525 --> 20:28.726
<i> It's not just the big moments.</i>
<i> It's the simple things.</i>

20:28.728 --> 20:31.229
<i> Like cheering on</i>
<i> your favorite team,</i>

20:31.231 --> 20:31.996
<i> roasting marshmallows,</i>

20:31.998 --> 20:35.066
<i> or finding out the</i>
<i> people you've been</i>
<i> keeping at a distance</i>

20:35.068 --> 20:37.435
<i> are actually the people</i>
<i> you're closest to.</i>

20:37.437 --> 20:39.036
So, tell me the truth.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.739
Was it heather G
or heather S?

20:42.375 --> 20:43.975
Heather T.

20:43.977 --> 20:46.877
No!
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
