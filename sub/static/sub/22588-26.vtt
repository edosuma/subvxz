02:50.802 --> 02:51.935
Oh, they're so brave.

02:51.937 --> 02:56.105
Oh, yes, one must concede
that, they have courage.

02:57.609 --> 02:58.808
I can't stand it.

02:58.810 --> 03:01.211
Oh, don't think
about it, my dear.

03:01.213 --> 03:03.079
Think about how
simple things will be

03:03.081 --> 03:04.747
with Batman out
of our way forever.

03:04.749 --> 03:09.986
Think of all the things you
can buy with what we can steal.

03:09.988 --> 03:11.488
That's a good idea.

03:11.490 --> 03:14.257
I better check the gauge.

03:14.259 --> 03:18.228
Oh! The gas is 20 feet
high in the chimney.

03:18.230 --> 03:19.896
They must be gone.

03:20.732 --> 03:22.866
Goodbye, Dynamic Duo!

03:23.602 --> 03:25.201
- 'Joker, let's get outta here.'
- 'No, wait.'

03:25.203 --> 03:29.606
'First we must shut off the
poisonous gas and pump it out.'

03:29.608 --> 03:31.107
'Some passerby
might get killer.'

03:31.109 --> 03:34.944
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
- Aww. There. There.

03:42.921 --> 03:43.820
Okay, it's off.

03:43.822 --> 03:46.556
Get the truck
and load up. Quickly. Quickly.

03:46.558 --> 03:48.825
Go on, boys.
Go on, me lads.

03:48.827 --> 03:51.828
I think I'll check
to make sure.

04:00.806 --> 04:02.639
Oh! Curses!

04:02.641 --> 04:04.908
They're getting away!

04:15.988 --> 04:18.954
Look! They discovered
we're gone.

04:21.860 --> 04:23.526
Hey, boss.
Hey, boss. Boss, boss.

04:23.528 --> 04:26.129
Look! Look, look.
They're up on the chimney.

04:26.131 --> 04:27.831
I know that, you fool.

04:27.833 --> 04:31.034
- How'd they get up there?
- They took the elevator.

04:31.036 --> 04:31.801
What do you think?

04:31.803 --> 04:33.903
Want us to get
a rifle and-and shoot 'em?

04:33.905 --> 04:39.008
No, wait a minute, I've got
a much more succulent idea.

04:40.178 --> 04:42.745
Get in. Get in.

04:47.619 --> 04:48.852
Strange, they're leaving.

04:48.854 --> 04:51.054
Perhaps they've
changed their plans.

04:51.056 --> 04:53.490
Now, we'll have
to find them again.

04:53.492 --> 04:54.023
Right. Let's go.

04:54.025 --> 04:57.494
Remember the <i> maharajah's</i>
still in their power.

05:32.264 --> 05:33.229
Oh, drat!

05:33.231 --> 05:35.765
Nothing from this hole
from the golf course

05:35.767 --> 05:36.933
or from the stolen hairpin.

05:36.935 --> 05:38.768
What did The Joker
use the hairpin for?

05:38.770 --> 05:42.939
To trigger the gas bomb
that knocked out the maharaja.

05:43.909 --> 05:45.842
The gas bomb..

05:45.844 --> 05:49.612
Of course, if a trace
of the gas remains..

06:05.297 --> 06:07.330
We've got it!

06:15.707 --> 06:17.907
Uh-hah! That's it.

06:17.909 --> 06:19.108
It's an uncommon gas.

06:19.110 --> 06:22.912
I know of but one place in
Gotham where it'd be available.

06:22.914 --> 06:25.148
The Ferguson Novelty
and Magician's Supply Company.

06:25.150 --> 06:27.817
- That's it.
- Right and we've got to hurry.

06:27.819 --> 06:29.852
If the <i> maharajah</i>
isn't recovered soon

06:29.854 --> 06:33.656
it could make things very
difficult with this government.

06:34.059 --> 06:37.060
In fact, I'm surprised
there hasn't been--

06:37.062 --> 06:38.895
- Let's go--
- Wait.

06:38.897 --> 06:39.696
We'll go.

06:39.698 --> 06:41.898
But as Dick Grayson
and Bruce Wayne.

06:41.900 --> 06:42.765
Why? Do you think..

06:42.767 --> 06:47.203
That it's being used
as a front by The Joker?

06:47.205 --> 06:48.871
Exactly!

06:57.682 --> 06:59.782
Who does
this remind you of?

06:59.784 --> 07:01.951
Careful, old chum.

07:05.657 --> 07:08.257
Good afternoon.
May I help you?

07:08.259 --> 07:08.891
Thank you.

07:08.893 --> 07:11.661
We thought we might
find some amusing favors for

07:11.663 --> 07:14.263
a small dinner party
this young man's giving.

07:14.265 --> 07:15.965
To be sure.

07:15.967 --> 07:17.700
How about these?

07:23.975 --> 07:25.141
Very ingenious.

07:25.143 --> 07:29.879
Oh, miss, what is a "One-way
glass reversing refractor?"

07:29.881 --> 07:33.716
A prism, which placed flush
against any one-way glass

07:33.718 --> 07:36.119
'will by refraction
enable one to look'

07:36.121 --> 07:37.153
'through the one-way glass'

07:37.155 --> 07:40.957
in the direction opposite to the
one for which it was designed.

07:40.959 --> 07:43.793
You mean like
one-way mirrors and stuff.

07:43.795 --> 07:44.427
'Yes.'

07:44.429 --> 07:47.964
You can look through
from the wrong side.

07:47.966 --> 07:48.731
That's right.

07:48.733 --> 07:51.834
Gee, Bruce, this would be
keen for spies, wouldn't it?

07:51.836 --> 07:53.803
Why don't you select
something you like?

07:53.805 --> 07:58.007
And I'll just,
uh, browse around.

08:16.795 --> 08:19.729
'Anything suspicious?'

08:19.731 --> 08:22.799
No, just some squares.

08:27.472 --> 08:30.440
Well, what are you looking at?

08:30.442 --> 08:33.342
A big, fat bundle of ransom.

08:33.344 --> 08:36.212
And I think
we've waited long enough.

09:09.815 --> 09:14.618
'So, this is the photograph
we took from across the street.'

09:14.620 --> 09:17.254
Now, judging from
the topography

09:17.256 --> 09:18.355
the underground prison room

09:18.357 --> 09:21.525
should be located
about here, under the hill.

09:21.527 --> 09:24.161
Holy impregnability!
It's as good as a fort.

09:24.163 --> 09:25.662
If the police
try to break in

09:25.664 --> 09:27.664
The Joker would get
too much warning.

09:27.666 --> 09:28.798
The <i> maharajah</i> could be injured.

09:28.800 --> 09:32.269
So,<i> we</i> have to find
a way to get in secretly.

09:32.271 --> 09:33.437
But how?

09:33.439 --> 09:35.872
Fortunately, I got a glimpse

09:35.874 --> 09:39.376
of a large square grill
in the back wall.

09:39.378 --> 09:40.243
What do you think it is?

09:40.245 --> 09:44.247
Unless I miss my guess, it's the
cover for a ventilating shaft

09:44.249 --> 09:44.881
which comes out..

09:44.883 --> 09:48.251
...right here, on top
of the hill straight above.

09:48.253 --> 09:50.887
Holy camouflage!
What a way to get in.

09:50.889 --> 09:52.923
If only we knew
where it was.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.526
If my trigonometry is correct..

09:56.528 --> 10:00.964
...and based on this photograph,
it should emerge..

10:03.469 --> 10:05.269
...right here.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.236
Gosh, Batman.

10:06.238 --> 10:08.439
I'll never neglect
my math again.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.207
Let's go.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.953
'Batman, where are you?'

10:22.955 --> 10:24.722
Shh! Shh!

10:26.425 --> 10:31.495
If it's nearby
they could hear us down under.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.244
I think I found it.

10:47.246 --> 10:50.447
How far did you say
that room was underground?

10:50.449 --> 10:51.882
About 50 feet.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.383
Enough to give us
good momentum.

10:53.385 --> 10:55.986
Oh, boy! I'll say.
Can I go first?

10:55.988 --> 10:58.388
I wanna see their faces.

10:59.291 --> 11:01.425
Dynamic seniority.

11:02.461 --> 11:06.497
This could be
a mistake I suppose.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.533
Well, look out below.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.806
Don't anyone move!

11:15.808 --> 11:17.808
You're all under arrest.

11:17.810 --> 11:18.976
It's Batman!

11:18.978 --> 11:21.178
Joker, where's the maharaja?

11:21.180 --> 11:24.081
I told you he'd
find us, you clown.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.016
What's the matter
with you, Batman?

11:26.018 --> 11:27.885
I'm the funny man around here.

11:27.887 --> 11:31.455
To arms, men!
Repel the invaders.

11:31.457 --> 11:36.927
Alright, if that's
the way you want it.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.015
Egads! The tide's
turning against us.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.250
Let's scram, Joker.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.319
Ooh! We'd better.

12:43.495 --> 12:46.430
What happened?
Where'd they go?

12:48.500 --> 12:52.436
Holy mole hill!
They went into the mountain.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.538
'Fiends!'

12:54.540 --> 12:56.039
Probably comes out
the hill's other side.

12:56.041 --> 12:59.109
Where's the maharaja? I didn't
see him when we entered.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.211
They probably
moved him before we came.

13:01.213 --> 13:03.180
We'll make a thorough search.

13:03.182 --> 13:06.283
I don't expect
to find anything.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.067
Commissioner Gordon.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.669
Oh, hello, Batman.

13:25.671 --> 13:27.604
Yes, I've been
waiting for you to call.

13:27.606 --> 13:30.073
I-I hope you have
good news for us.

13:30.075 --> 13:31.208
I'm afraid not, commissioner.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.644
We traced The Joker
here to his hideout

13:33.646 --> 13:35.979
and surprised him but..

13:35.981 --> 13:38.181
...he eluded us I'm afraid.

13:38.183 --> 13:39.349
And the maharaja?

13:39.351 --> 13:40.917
There was no sign of him.

13:40.919 --> 13:43.887
If we don't find him soon, I
shall have to notify Washington.

13:43.889 --> 13:48.325
Yes, I'm aware of that. Have you
heard about the ransom yet?

13:48.327 --> 13:49.659
I don't know.

13:49.961 --> 13:52.862
You might send the wagon
over here, there are..

13:52.864 --> 13:55.131
...four of The Joker's
men to pick up.

13:55.133 --> 13:59.469
We're at the Ferguson Magician's
and Novelty Supply.

13:59.471 --> 14:00.637
Okay, I'll take care of that.

14:00.639 --> 14:02.806
I'll notify the...wait a minute.

14:02.808 --> 14:05.942
Commissioner, The Joker is
on the air on our band

14:05.944 --> 14:07.177
he wants to speak to you.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.112
Good. Bring him in.
Did you hear that?

14:09.114 --> 14:12.215
- 'Yes.'
- Well, hang on and listen.

14:18.490 --> 14:22.625
This is Commissioner Gordon's
office, go ahead, Joker.

14:22.627 --> 14:26.863
'Good evening, commissioner.
Happy to find you in.'

14:26.865 --> 14:28.932
'Uh, perhaps you
can do me a favor?'

14:28.934 --> 14:32.702
I warn you, Joker,
if the <i> maharajah</i> is harmed

14:32.704 --> 14:35.071
we'll hunt you down
if it takes a 100 years.

14:35.073 --> 14:38.107
'By that time my jokes
would be stale'

14:38.109 --> 14:40.043
'wouldn't they, commissioner?'

14:40.045 --> 14:42.679
I haven't the time
for chitchat with your kind.

14:42.681 --> 14:44.514
If you have
something to say, say it!

14:44.516 --> 14:49.552
'Very well. I want to talk
to Batman, can you arrange it?'

14:49.554 --> 14:51.888
- Did you hear that, Batman?
- 'Yes, I heard it.'

14:51.890 --> 14:55.558
- Do you want to talk to him?
- By all means.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.994
I just happen to be
in touch with Batman now

14:57.996 --> 15:00.230
and we've set up
a relay in the office.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.066
The next time you speak
he'll hear your voice

15:03.068 --> 15:05.668
and you can hear his reply.

15:05.670 --> 15:07.704
'What superb service.'

15:07.706 --> 15:10.640
- 'Are you there, Batman?'
- I'm here.

15:10.642 --> 15:12.976
'Well, the fun and games
are over, old fellow'

15:12.978 --> 15:15.278
'and it's time
for the harvest, as it were.'

15:15.280 --> 15:20.550
'I want to enlist your help
in the ransom arrangements.'

15:21.086 --> 15:21.518
Never.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.554
'Now, don't take
a stand until you've'

15:24.556 --> 15:25.722
'heard everything, old boy.'

15:25.724 --> 15:29.058
'I've a friend here,
who wants to talk to you.'

15:29.060 --> 15:34.964
<i> 'This is <i> Maharajah</i>
of Nimpah speaking.'</i>

15:34.966 --> 15:37.233
Your Highness, are you alright?

15:37.235 --> 15:38.268
'Quite alright, thank you.'

15:38.270 --> 15:42.839
'And enjoying delightful
interval with bandit Joker.'

15:42.841 --> 15:45.108
'But now,
time to return to business.'

15:45.110 --> 15:50.880
'Would Batman please arrange to
cash a personal check tomorrow?'

15:50.882 --> 15:53.049
Your check? What for?

15:53.051 --> 15:55.084
'For ransom money. What else.'

15:55.086 --> 15:58.588
You're gonna cash
the ransom check yourself?

15:59.291 --> 16:00.324
For how much?

16:00.326 --> 16:02.426
'Half million dollars. US.'

16:03.228 --> 16:06.296
'How'd you intend
to pay it to The Joker?'

16:06.298 --> 16:08.565
<i> 'That is already arranged.'</i>

16:08.567 --> 16:11.668
'between bandit Joker
and <i> maharajah.'</i>

16:11.670 --> 16:15.772
'What is the matter?
Do you not approve?'

16:15.774 --> 16:17.840
I certainly do not approve.

16:17.842 --> 16:19.275
I'll have nothing to do with it.

16:19.277 --> 16:22.946
You're free to do
as you wish of course but..

16:22.948 --> 16:23.813
...leave me out of this.

16:23.815 --> 16:27.650
'But unfortunate, not possible
to leave you out.'

16:27.652 --> 16:29.852
'I will let
bandit Joker explain.'

16:29.854 --> 16:33.890
'You see, that's part
of the price, Batman.'

16:33.892 --> 16:35.224
'You make the arrangements.'

16:35.226 --> 16:38.761
'You be present
when he cashes the check'

16:38.763 --> 16:41.664
'and you endorse the check.'

16:41.666 --> 16:46.002
'Otherwise, no <i> maharajah.'</i>

16:47.305 --> 16:50.173
It's a rotten bargain, Joker.

16:50.175 --> 16:55.645
But the <i> maharajah's</i> safety
counts above everything else.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.213
You've won.

16:58.016 --> 17:00.350
The Gotham City State Bank.

17:00.352 --> 17:05.855
Main office,
tomorrow morning, ten o'clock.

17:06.290 --> 17:11.227
<i> Is it always darkest</i>
<i> just before the dawn?</i>

17:12.329 --> 17:17.066
<i> Not when dawn,</i>
<i> that is to say, 10 a.m.</i>

17:17.068 --> 17:19.636
<i> brings ruin and humiliation.</i>

17:19.637 --> 17:24.807
'Four hundred and fifty, four
hundred and sixty, seventy.'

17:24.809 --> 17:25.875
'Four hundred and eighty.'

17:25.877 --> 17:27.210
One half million dollars.

17:27.212 --> 17:31.381
There he is, right on time.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.620
This way, Your Highness.

17:40.659 --> 17:42.726
I am Prescott Belmont,
Your Highness.

17:42.728 --> 17:46.363
I don't believe you've met
Batman and his associate Robin.

17:46.365 --> 17:50.433
How do you do? I want to thank
you for cooperating, Batman.

17:50.435 --> 17:51.768
Now, you have the money?

17:51.770 --> 17:53.703
Yes, it's all here.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.372
Ah.

17:57.342 --> 17:58.842
Good.

18:09.755 --> 18:13.957
Pay to the order
of Batt...man..

18:13.959 --> 18:14.591
One "T."

18:14.593 --> 18:19.296
'Five hundred
thousand dollars..'

18:19.298 --> 18:21.464
...and no cents.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.906
Now, you will endorse.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.410
It is a sad day for Batman.

18:33.412 --> 18:36.645
Forced to use his name
for a criminal payoff.

18:36.647 --> 18:40.417
Yes. I'm afraid this will
tarnish his image considerably.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.889
Good. Now, I will
take the money.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.627
Don't you want to count it?

18:50.629 --> 18:51.962
Did you count it?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.663
Why, yes, of course.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.765
Why should we both count it?

18:55.767 --> 18:57.534
Oh, well..

18:59.304 --> 19:02.405
Your Highness, do you
actually intend to give

19:02.407 --> 19:04.441
this fortune
to that criminal?

19:04.443 --> 19:07.644
Even though you're free
and there's no necessity for it.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.646
Last desperate effort.

19:09.648 --> 19:10.247
Why not?

19:10.249 --> 19:14.317
You see,
Joker is an honorable bandit.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.585
We made a bargain.

19:15.587 --> 19:16.620
He kept his side

19:16.622 --> 19:20.790
now, Nimpahnese gentlemen
must keep my side.

19:21.193 --> 19:24.761
Yes, I can see that
you'd want to keep your word

19:24.763 --> 19:26.830
even to a lying criminal.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.098
'But to me Joker did not lie.'

19:29.100 --> 19:34.003
'You see, in my country a bandit
is an honorable profession.'

19:34.005 --> 19:35.738
'And if people lie to bandits'

19:35.740 --> 19:38.007
pretty soon bandit
will lie to people.

19:38.009 --> 19:40.076
And everybody will
not believe the other

19:40.078 --> 19:41.878
and they will
fight among themselves.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.181
'And then, pretty soon
nobody will have anything.'

19:45.183 --> 19:50.019
'Also in my country,
population is 80 perc..'

19:50.922 --> 19:53.122
- Go!
- Oh, no you don't.

20:07.172 --> 20:10.039
Batman, what are you doing?

20:48.347 --> 20:49.446
It's The Joker.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.647
'That it is.'

20:50.649 --> 20:52.816
But where's the <i> maharajah?</i>

20:52.818 --> 20:54.351
There isn't any.

20:54.353 --> 20:54.885
There never was.

20:54.887 --> 20:58.221
You mean,
it was The Joker all the time?

20:58.223 --> 20:58.655
Right.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.491
As you recall, you never
saw the two of 'em together.

21:01.493 --> 21:06.229
Then, his goal was not only
a historic criminal coup

21:06.231 --> 21:07.397
but your disgrace as well.

21:07.399 --> 21:11.201
Not only that, my endorsement
on a worthless check

21:11.203 --> 21:13.236
for half a million dollars.

21:13.238 --> 21:14.905
But if you
hadn't thwarted him..

21:14.907 --> 21:20.644
Oh, Batman, how did you ever
see through his devilish plot?

21:20.779 --> 21:23.413
It wasn't difficult,
if you remember the key

21:23.415 --> 21:24.848
to The Jokers twisted mind.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.717
'He never means
what he seems to mean. '

21:27.719 --> 21:29.653
Now, why didn't
we think of that?

21:29.655 --> 21:33.456
Also, it seemed strange
that we'd heard no protest

21:33.458 --> 21:34.558
from his government.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.794
So, Batman called
the Palace of Nimpah.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.662
The real <i> maharajah..</i>

21:38.664 --> 21:42.699
'...is on a hunting trip
in the Nimpah mountains.'

21:42.701 --> 21:45.769
You've done it again, Batman.

21:48.774 --> 21:51.274
Egads!

21:51.276 --> 21:53.543
I'm deflated.

21:53.545 --> 21:55.779
A fitting end for you, Joker.

21:55.781 --> 21:58.315
Like the rest
of your criminal ilk

21:58.317 --> 21:59.549
'you were never anything'

21:59.551 --> 22:01.851
but a threatening bag
of hot air.

22:01.853 --> 22:03.520
Chief O'Hara, call your men.

22:03.522 --> 22:05.855
Cart this human trash away.

22:05.857 --> 22:07.557
Right.

22:19.004 --> 22:22.539
<i> An hour or so later</i>
<i> at stately Wayne Manor</i>

22:22.541 --> 22:26.977
<i> where everything is</i>
<i> now tranquil and serene</i>

22:26.979 --> 22:28.445
<i> or is it?</i>

22:40.459 --> 22:42.125
Are you sure
you want him, sir?

22:42.127 --> 22:45.262
I got the impression that
he had just satisfactorily

22:45.264 --> 22:47.231
concluded the, uh, do.

22:47.233 --> 22:52.102
But I must speak
to him immediately, please.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.304
If you insist, sir.

22:55.274 --> 23:02.212
No, Dick. You'll get as fat
as the <i> Maharajah</i> of Nimpah.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.513
Who, Aunt Harriet?

23:03.515 --> 23:05.582
The <i> Maharajah</i> of Nimpah.

23:05.584 --> 23:09.319
I just saw his picture
in the Gotham City Herald.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.355
He was on
a tiger hunting expedition

23:11.357 --> 23:15.525
and you never saw anybody
so fat in your whole life.

23:15.527 --> 23:19.296
Mercy alive, with all his money
you'd think he could afford

23:19.298 --> 23:21.532
to see a doctor about a diet.

23:22.402 --> 23:25.303
It's the Bat-phone, sir.

23:25.305 --> 23:26.771
Now?

23:27.440 --> 23:31.842
That reminds me, Dick, I have
a new volume on tiger hunting.

23:31.844 --> 23:35.279
It's in the study,
I've wanted to show it to you.

23:35.281 --> 23:36.647
Holy Encore, you mean..

23:36.649 --> 23:39.483
Gosh, Bruce, I'm real
interested in tiger hunting.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.752
Excuse us, Aunt Harriet.

23:42.655 --> 23:43.888
Tea, madam?

23:43.890 --> 23:45.489
Oh, yes, Alfred.

23:50.663 --> 23:51.996
Yes, commissioner.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.332
Shocking news, Batman.

23:54.334 --> 23:55.699
What could it be?

23:55.801 --> 23:58.068
I've heard
a most alarming rumor.

23:58.070 --> 24:02.673
That you've been asked to go to
California and run for governor.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.642
Calm your fears, commissioner.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.743
The rumor is unfounded.

24:06.745 --> 24:10.414
As long as there's a criminal
at large in Gotham City

24:10.416 --> 24:12.450
wild horses
couldn't drag me away.

24:12.452 --> 24:15.353
Oh, thank heavens, Batman.

24:15.355 --> 24:17.255
Saints be praised.

24:17.257 --> 24:18.856
Goodbye, commissioner.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.825
Holy golden gate!

24:25.832 --> 24:30.434
