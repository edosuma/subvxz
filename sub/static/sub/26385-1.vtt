You and her,
you gotta save yourselves!

01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:37.730
I can help you right now! Don't!

01:29:38.029 --> 01:29:40.398
I convict you
of treason, Mayor.

01:29:40.831 --> 01:29:44.102
MARIE: Oh, my God! [CRIES]

01:30:05.424 --> 01:30:06.759
[GUNSHOT]

01:30:20.705 --> 01:30:21.806
WOLF: Cash!

01:30:25.477 --> 01:30:27.747
- [SCREAMS]
- SANDRA: Freeze!

01:30:34.553 --> 01:30:35.520
Officer...

01:30:36.688 --> 01:30:38.022
we're not with them.

01:30:39.558 --> 01:30:41.493
We're here to get
Marie back safely.

01:30:43.394 --> 01:30:45.397
Well, you're too late.

01:30:46.764 --> 01:30:48.099
She's at home with her father.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.502
That's good.

01:30:51.403 --> 01:30:52.772
You mind if I verify that?

01:30:53.438 --> 01:30:54.339
Go right ahead.

01:30:56.007 --> 01:30:57.443
Keep those guns down.

01:31:12.257 --> 01:31:13.792
Well, no answer.

01:31:16.295 --> 01:31:17.196
[BANGING]

01:31:22.533 --> 01:31:23.434
Freeze!

01:31:36.715 --> 01:31:39.518
DARRYL: Fuck! [GRUNTS]

01:31:43.421 --> 01:31:44.656
- Darryl?
- Yeah?

01:31:44.889 --> 01:31:48.324
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.

01:31:49.027 --> 01:31:50.462
I can never trust
you again.

01:31:58.903 --> 01:32:01.005
Sounds like you are out
of bullets.

01:32:01.407 --> 01:32:02.875
I count nine.

01:32:03.974 --> 01:32:05.910
Sounds like you don't have
any more either.

01:32:06.612 --> 01:32:09.415
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

01:32:10.415 --> 01:32:12.051
[LAUGHS]

01:32:13.117 --> 01:32:14.053
Okay.

01:32:16.688 --> 01:32:17.623
Let's...

01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:19.558
find...

01:32:20.759 --> 01:32:22.461
- out.
- [LAUGHS]

01:32:23.394 --> 01:32:25.129
I am not afraid of you.

01:32:29.033 --> 01:32:30.469
Let's settle this...

01:32:31.670 --> 01:32:33.005
a different way.

01:32:33.438 --> 01:32:36.007
[GRUNTING]

01:32:37.843 --> 01:32:41.279
[LAUGHS]
Your muscles make you slow.

01:32:42.147 --> 01:32:45.451
Your lack of
muscles make you weak!

01:32:50.455 --> 01:32:52.457
[PANTING]

01:32:58.796 --> 01:33:00.598
[GRUNTING]

01:33:11.643 --> 01:33:12.578
Jesus, Mikhail...

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:16.482
you're done.

01:33:19.651 --> 01:33:20.685
It's over!

01:33:22.955 --> 01:33:24.555
The cops are on their way.

01:33:26.791 --> 01:33:27.926
It's done!

01:33:30.627 --> 01:33:31.729
[KNIFE CLATTERING]

01:33:32.096 --> 01:33:34.099
You can't shoot an unarmed man.

01:33:39.938 --> 01:33:41.540
[GUN SCRAPING]

01:33:54.419 --> 01:33:56.421
[PANTING]

01:34:29.153 --> 01:34:30.421
How about a drink?

01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:33.525
Sounds good.

01:35:17.493 --> 01:35:22.493
