00:06.500 --> 00:09.970
Jason is no longer the man we
knew, his heart has blackened.

00:10.020 --> 00:13.720
He is drawn to us. I've
seen it with my own eyes.

00:15.120 --> 00:18.150
I fear that without you, Jason
cannot resist Pasiphae.

00:18.200 --> 00:21.090
You're the only one who can save him.

00:21.140 --> 00:24.080
~ Who is this?
~ He is Jason's father.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.250
What is it?

00:54.300 --> 00:56.040
It's nothing.

00:56.900 --> 01:00.060
Plum. Look around you.

01:04.540 --> 01:05.810
There are no fruit
trees in this wood.

01:05.860 --> 01:08.690
Not a plum tree within a day's walk.

01:08.740 --> 01:11.500
So... how did this get here?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.120
General!

01:52.600 --> 01:54.110
We've found remains of a fire.

01:54.160 --> 01:57.440
The embers are still warm.
They cannot have got far.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.430
Any news?

02:12.600 --> 02:16.000
Three days and still no
sign of the fugitives.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.950
We found a camp.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.480
It's strange...

02:23.520 --> 02:25.870
When Goran gave me the news...

02:25.920 --> 02:27.790
I felt no anger.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.670
Just relief.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.440
He is your son.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.150
I found myself thinking things
I'd never thought before.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.950
That he was my ally. That we could
rule Atlantis side by side, as one.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.040
What you desire is not strange.
He is your true heir.

02:49.960 --> 02:51.100
No.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.350
I cannot give in to such weakness.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.940
I believe he feels the same.

02:58.400 --> 03:02.190
The forces that bind him to
us grow stronger by the day.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.990
I can feel it in my heart.

03:04.040 --> 03:08.040
Be patient - he will come to us.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.510
Pasiphae's hatred knows no end.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.190
She will hunt her own
son like a wild animal.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.240
It's a good thing.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.350
It means they haven't found him.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.070
If an army can't find him,
what chance do we stand?

03:31.120 --> 03:34.670
We should split into two
groups. Be more methodical.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.230
You two go east, follow the river.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.630
We'll follow it west and
meet you back here at dusk.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.230
It is a waste of time!

03:40.280 --> 03:43.680
If Jason's not already
dead, he soon will be.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.750
Hercules!

03:48.400 --> 03:49.550
What is wrong with you?

03:49.600 --> 03:51.270
In his hour of need, I deserted him.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.510
What is done is done, we
cannot change the past,

03:53.560 --> 03:55.710
but we can change what is to come.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.310
I'm useless. I failed Medusa.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.470
Now I've failed Jason.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.590
That is not true.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.630
The times he's saved me...

04:02.680 --> 04:05.550
We all make mistakes.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.390
You're angry, you're hurt.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.350
Forget that.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.270
As long as there is a chance
that Jason is still alive,

04:12.320 --> 04:15.820
we must do everything in
our power to save him.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.870
You're right.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.459
We'll follow the river west.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.830
It is a necessary evil.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.230
It allows the people to
forget their troubles.

04:50.280 --> 04:54.670
It is a palliative - to placate
and distract them from dissent.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.670
They are like children.

05:09.440 --> 05:13.310
They must learn that those
that behave will be rewarded.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.280
Go.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.630
And those that don't...

05:22.680 --> 05:24.760
will be punished.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.920
Looks like footprints.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.150
But they're not Jason's.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.340
You can be that sure?

05:45.240 --> 05:49.760
I know everything about him.
At least, I thought I did.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.790
Jason's actions are not his own.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.230
Knowing that Pasiphae is
his mother has changed him.

05:58.280 --> 06:02.200
Perhaps that has changed
how you feel about him, too.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.120
Not since the moment
I laid eyes upon him.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.200
You are fortunate.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.350
I do not have that bond with my son.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.400
It's not too late.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.440
All the moments I have missed.

06:18.830 --> 06:19.830
You've lost much.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.110
We live so long before we
understand what really matters.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.160
The only thing of any
true value is love.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.430
It rules even the Gods.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.950
They are withdrawing.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.270
Something has happened.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.220
Jason.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.920
I came here certain in the knowledge
of what I would say, but I...

07:27.400 --> 07:29.270
I look at you...

07:31.560 --> 07:33.900
I see so much of myself.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.790
Do you not feel it?

07:40.280 --> 07:42.760
The bond that binds us.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.750
We are tethered, Jason.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.140
It is a cord that
can never be broken.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.920
Perhaps the Gods have brought
us together now for a reason.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.900
To mend this wound...

08:20.520 --> 08:23.120
Would you not let that be so?

08:27.960 --> 08:29.430
I would.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.539
I came here...

08:44.560 --> 08:46.190
My sole desire was to kill you.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.910
How could I?

08:52.480 --> 08:54.680
You are my only child.

08:56.560 --> 09:01.000
I gave you life - I will
not take it from you.

09:22.040 --> 09:25.040
Shall I set a date for
the execution, Majesty?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.040
No.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.990
Jason has been found guilty
of killing the Oracle.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.710
What reason is there to delay?

09:34.760 --> 09:37.430
The people are enjoying the games.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.430
The people want justice.

09:39.480 --> 09:40.750
Are you doubting my actions?

09:40.800 --> 09:43.830
~ No, Majesty.
~ Then why these incessant questions?

09:43.880 --> 09:48.790
Jason's death would ease tension in the
city more than the games ever could.

09:48.840 --> 09:52.110
How much longer must they
wait for retribution?

09:52.160 --> 09:55.830
He has murdered Poseidon's
holy servant.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.670
Then it is for the Gods to decide.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.430
We should consult the Oracle.

09:59.480 --> 10:03.030
Why? There is no need.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.150
His fate is sealed.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.270
At the moment of Jason's capture,
I saw a flight of ravens go

10:09.320 --> 10:10.510
east across the moon.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.260
I took it as a sign that
the Gods were not happy.

10:17.840 --> 10:23.110
Are you are prepared to wager everything
on some feeling of foreboding?

10:23.160 --> 10:26.460
Only a fool ignores a
warning from the Gods.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.160
I wish to know if the boy's
sacrifice will please the Gods.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.600
Now.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.640
What is it, my child? Tell us.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.720
Their voices spoke with fire...
with tribulation... They...

11:07.800 --> 11:09.670
They cried out as one...

11:09.720 --> 11:12.060
Demanding his salvation.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.670
This makes no sense.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.270
It is as I thought. They
have passed judgment.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.590
Their wishes are plain.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.550
Why would the Gods intervene
in such a matter?!

11:20.600 --> 11:24.150
You imagine yourself powerful
enough to question their will?

11:24.200 --> 11:26.630
Majesty, I am not certain
that you understand -

11:26.680 --> 11:28.230
the people demand justice.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.430
They want Jason punished
for his crime.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.750
You are weighing too much on this.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.310
What you've said is true -
if the Gods wish to intervene,

11:34.360 --> 11:36.760
who am I to question them?

11:38.080 --> 11:40.110
Their answer will not sit
easy with the people.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.950
Well, that is for you to deal with.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.080
To calm them, I also need answers.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.560
They must know the reason
the Gods have spared him.

12:01.630 --> 12:02.630
Very well.

12:02.680 --> 12:08.830
Majesty, Cassandra is capable
of telling only the truth.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.590
Are you sure this is
what you wish to ask?

12:11.640 --> 12:15.440
Enough of this - your Queen
has given you an order.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.070
Their reason was plain -

12:25.120 --> 12:29.550
for they warned that there
is no greater crime

12:29.600 --> 12:33.280
than a mother putting
her own flesh to death.

12:35.520 --> 12:40.950
Please, Majesty, she is not
responsible for her words.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.740
You have no need to protect her.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.720
Jason is your son?

12:53.360 --> 12:55.500
The Gods have spoken.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.990
There will be no sacrifice.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.510
He is a blasphemer. If you
take no action against him,

13:07.560 --> 13:08.590
what will the people think?

13:08.640 --> 13:10.510
The people are preoccupied
with the games.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.030
His crime is forged in their minds.

13:13.080 --> 13:16.840
It will take more than a petty games
for them to forget about this!

13:19.240 --> 13:23.440
~ You cannot let him walk free!
~ That is not what I intend!

13:24.480 --> 13:29.040
Let him face the arena. Let
the Gods decide his fate.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.270
Very well.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.720
Now, be gone - all of you.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.150
You are meddling in affairs
that are not of your concern.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.950
I have the Queen's best
interests at heart.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.070
Do you? Are you sure
it is her interests?

13:51.120 --> 13:53.350
Do not challenge me, for if Pasiphae
were forced to choose,

13:53.400 --> 13:56.070
she would choose me every time.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.200
Hercules?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.590
I cannot lie here any longer.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.710
What are you doing?

14:11.040 --> 14:12.070
Going back to Atlantis.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.750
Are you mad? We can't.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.110
What has happened to
Jason? We must find out.

14:17.160 --> 14:21.630
He's right. But it is I that
should travel to Atlantis.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.030
But it's too dangerous.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.790
The Oracle has spoken
- her words are clear.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.840
I am his father...

14:28.280 --> 14:31.020
... only I can unlock his heart.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.630
What do you want?

15:03.680 --> 15:06.420
Please... It is from Pythagoras.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.790
There's an alley where the tanners
meet, off the Sacred Way.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.840
Be there when the moon
is at its height.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.990
Pasiphae does not want you to die.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.470
She is doing everything
in her power to save you.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.470
You are no longer sentenced to death.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.480
Then what?

15:53.760 --> 15:55.830
You must be strong.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.400
Tell me.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.990
You are to fight in the arena.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.280
Your life is now in
the hands of the Gods.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.150
Did you find anything?

16:19.200 --> 16:23.150
Jason is a condemned man
- Pasiphae is holding games.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.630
He will be lucky to survive
more than a day in the arena.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.950
Can you take me to him?

16:27.000 --> 16:31.160
The amphitheatre is heavily guarded.
No-one can get in there.

16:33.910 --> 16:34.910
There must be a way.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.320
You will not get to him.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.590
Please, I beg you.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.580
It is impossible.

16:47.920 --> 16:51.160
The unclean. Do they still
aid the corpse bearers?

16:54.400 --> 16:55.870
They do.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.160
Good. There is something
I need you to do.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.500
That's my corner.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.110
I sit there.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.240
Aargh!

19:18.440 --> 19:20.510
What are you doing?

19:27.240 --> 19:29.510
Are you going to help?!

20:11.520 --> 20:13.350
You're not as useless
as you look, then.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.340
I thought I'd let you soften him up.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.590
Look out!

21:20.560 --> 21:21.900
Aargh!

21:52.800 --> 21:55.900
It seems the Gods really
do smile on him.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.640
Calm yourself. Calm, you're safe.

22:34.760 --> 22:38.360
You are lucky, Jason. It
is just a flesh wound.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.990
Who are you?

22:43.960 --> 22:45.560
I know you.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.910
You saved my life...

22:50.960 --> 22:53.070
in the silver mines.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.470
You remember.

22:54.520 --> 22:55.720
Yes.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.280
Look beyond the scars.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.150
You still do not know who I am?

23:04.200 --> 23:07.550
Search deeper in your heart,
beyond the darkness,

23:07.600 --> 23:10.340
and you will know it to be true.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.620
I am your father.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.350
My father is dead.

23:20.400 --> 23:24.630
Do not believe what
you have been told.

23:24.680 --> 23:27.560
Look at me. Jason.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.820
Tell me you recognise me.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.590
Get away from him.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.470
But he's wounded.

23:36.520 --> 23:39.720
Your job is to look
after the dead! Go!

23:57.440 --> 23:58.880
Here.

24:02.280 --> 24:03.910
All will be well.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.960
That's supposed to comfort me, is it?

24:07.800 --> 24:09.270
I'm not a child.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.190
I didn't mean...

24:14.400 --> 24:15.940
I'm sorry.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.240
Pay me no heed.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.760
I'm not used to sitting idle
while others risk their lives.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.870
We want the same thing, Hercules.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.320
I know.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.870
I fear I have lost him.

24:45.800 --> 24:46.940
No.

24:51.280 --> 24:53.990
My heart cannot bear the
thought of life without him.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.980
To think of it...

24:56.560 --> 24:58.510
I don't know what I'd do.

24:58.560 --> 25:01.300
I understand that only too well.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.120
I promise Jason will
return safe and well.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.420
I will do all I can to that end.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.400
I know.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.340
Thank you.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.280
Jason.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.440
I am your father.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.430
This charm you have about your neck.

25:41.480 --> 25:45.110
When you were but a child,
I gave you this...

25:45.160 --> 25:48.860
as a token of my love.
For you to remember me by.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.870
Jason, it is me.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.190
I know who you are,

25:56.240 --> 25:58.180
but I don't care.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.670
You are dead to me.

26:02.160 --> 26:05.030
I refuse to believe you mean that.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.710
The knowledge of who you are...
of what is contained within you...

26:12.760 --> 26:14.310
It has...

26:14.360 --> 26:18.470
opened a door. It is tempting
you... drawing you.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.460
You must resist, you must fight it.

26:21.760 --> 26:25.630
You must not be drawn
into Pasiphae's world.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.680
Do not give in to that
side of yourself.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.550
~ You are not like her.
~ Guards!

26:31.600 --> 26:32.940
Jason.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.360
Guards!

26:36.600 --> 26:39.640
I beg you... Think
on what I have said.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.480
Do not turn your back on who you are.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.920
Do not close your heart
on those who love you.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.780
Up!

27:32.840 --> 27:34.110
Here.

27:36.640 --> 27:40.240
If you get through this,
you can have my corner.

27:41.640 --> 27:44.720
You saved my life.
I won't forget that.

27:45.720 --> 27:47.390
You saved mine.

27:47.440 --> 27:50.640
And I've never seen
anyone fight like you.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.950
Kai esso.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.340
Aargh!

29:00.640 --> 29:03.470
Jason! Jason.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.590
Talk to me, please.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.160
Please.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.510
I remember you...

29:13.560 --> 29:16.150
in your mother's arms.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.270
You are so like her.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.620
She was so beautiful.

29:28.360 --> 29:31.230
I loved her more than life itself.

29:33.760 --> 29:37.590
As a woman of Colchis,
I knew she had powers

29:37.640 --> 29:40.580
mere mortals could never comprehend.

29:43.440 --> 29:47.680
But when I realised the source
of those powers was darkness...

29:50.720 --> 29:52.990
.. it terrified me.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.870
I... saw her change.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.660
Watched her...

30:00.200 --> 30:02.540
.. give in to temptation.

30:04.320 --> 30:07.820
She slipped further and
further from me, and...

30:08.800 --> 30:12.300
.. all trace of the woman
I had loved was lost.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.000
Please... please...

30:18.240 --> 30:20.960
I cannot lose you too, Jason.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.960
Do not go the same way as her.

30:28.440 --> 30:32.240
Turn toward the light, turn
your back on the darkness.

30:34.280 --> 30:37.480
In this world, there
are many who love you.

30:41.280 --> 30:44.670
If I have learnt anything,
it is that this

30:44.720 --> 30:47.460
is the only thing of true worth.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.200
Look at me.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.550
Feel my love.

30:55.600 --> 30:59.440
Please, I beg you.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.420
Oh, Jason!

31:08.440 --> 31:12.760
I will not abandon you again. I
will not leave here without you.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.110
Jason. Here. Take this.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.950
~ What is it?
~ Tonight, when the moon sets,

31:21.000 --> 31:22.470
drink it.

31:23.120 --> 31:25.350
It will slow your heartbeat
until no-one can feel it.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.350
You must trust me.

31:27.400 --> 31:31.960
I will keep you safe - as I have
always, always tried to do.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.070
I've looked everywhere.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.830
I think I know where he's gone.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.710
Icarus? Is it you?

32:21.760 --> 32:23.430
Yes, Father.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.270
How are you here?

32:26.320 --> 32:28.270
It is no matter.

32:28.320 --> 32:31.420
They told me I wouldn't
see you again.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.560
Father... I brought you this.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.710
No. It's too late for food.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.110
Then you will die.

32:40.160 --> 32:43.070
Why am I not dead already?
I was due to be hanged.

32:43.120 --> 32:47.430
Stop worrying about such things.
They are not going to kill you.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.550
I will not let them.

32:51.280 --> 32:54.430
~ What have you done?
~ It is of no concern.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.200
Tell me.

32:57.240 --> 33:00.400
You must eat. Please, Father.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.880
You must do all you can
to keep your strength.

33:06.280 --> 33:07.950
You must leave the city.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.870
Go. It's not safe here.

33:11.920 --> 33:15.080
I will not leave without
you. I will get you out.

33:24.760 --> 33:28.560
I have kept my side of the bargain,
now you must keep yours.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.320
Guards!

34:07.400 --> 34:09.139
Do something!

34:17.639 --> 34:19.380
Corpse bearer!

34:50.520 --> 34:52.030
Halt!

34:52.080 --> 34:54.150
Where are you going?

34:55.800 --> 34:58.110
These corpses need to be buried.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.150
There's a curfew.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.700
I have Royal permission.
Here, let me show you.

35:26.320 --> 35:27.660
Jason?

35:28.680 --> 35:30.020
Jason?

35:37.280 --> 35:39.110
Where are we?

35:39.160 --> 35:42.080
Lie still. We're not yet safe.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.540
Jason!

36:31.200 --> 36:32.720
Jason!

36:48.360 --> 36:49.960
It is over.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.600
Quickly, let's go!

36:59.120 --> 37:00.590
Leave me!

37:14.080 --> 37:15.680
Father.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.100
I'm all right.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.470
How did Goran know we'd be there?

37:21.520 --> 37:25.760
I killed a guard. They must have
found him and followed us.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.300
Try to take deep breaths.

37:40.360 --> 37:41.900
Thank you.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.030
Whatever passed between us...

37:45.080 --> 37:46.760
It was me.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.230
It was my fault.

37:49.280 --> 37:52.520
No. I don't blame you.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.900
I understand.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.400
Forgive me.

37:59.960 --> 38:04.760
You, and Pythagoras... You're
my only friends now.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.590
We must keep moving.

38:27.880 --> 38:28.910
Jason!

38:28.960 --> 38:30.760
He needs water.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.160
Here. Drink.

38:52.320 --> 38:55.840
I've forgotten everything
I wanted to say to you.

38:58.640 --> 38:59.750
Don't speak.

38:59.800 --> 39:04.480
All the times I should've
been with you...

39:05.640 --> 39:07.310
I was wrong.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.510
You were just trying to keep me safe.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.310
I failed you.

39:11.360 --> 39:12.560
No.

39:15.320 --> 39:18.120
Everything in me that's good...

39:19.920 --> 39:21.920
.. comes from you.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.800
You are the reason I am the man I am.

39:27.640 --> 39:33.920
You must know... You are more than
anything I could have wished for.

39:35.240 --> 39:38.870
You have your mother's
beauty, but not her heart.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.230
Do not be like her.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.430
I won't.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.990
You are stronger than that.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.630
Look towards the sun...

39:46.680 --> 39:48.620
not the darkness.

39:49.680 --> 39:52.390
Promise me. Promise me.

39:52.440 --> 39:53.710
I promise.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.230
Promise.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.920
Jason has escaped.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.230
How?

40:28.280 --> 40:29.750
A corpse bearer helped him.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.900
One of the unclean
from the silver mines.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.740
Aeson.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.470
He saved the boy.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.750
He took a blade that was

40:39.800 --> 40:41.790
~ meant for Jason.
~ And what happened?

40:41.840 --> 40:44.270
The man was wounded.

40:44.320 --> 40:46.060
To the heart.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.900
Resume the search.
I want Jason found.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.660
He chose his father over me!

41:02.840 --> 41:05.800
Where is this "bond" you spoke of?

41:07.070 --> 41:08.070
You witnessed it.

41:08.120 --> 41:11.270
I let him touch my heart!
I listened to you.

41:11.320 --> 41:12.910
All is not lost.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.830
Get out of here!

41:15.950 --> 41:16.950
~ Pasiphae...
~ Now!

41:17.000 --> 41:19.340
Before you burn with him.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.670
Jason must be caught
and he must be killed.

42:06.720 --> 42:07.990
You would really see him die?

42:08.040 --> 42:10.080
This night, it ends.
