I don't care
if you're the Easter bunny.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.083
You're not bringing this
on the station.

00:18.167 --> 00:20.792
The maker of all things
will not permit this.

00:20.875 --> 00:23.875
He will allow nothing to stand
between me and the blade.

00:23.958 --> 00:26.083
Yeah? Tell you what..

00:26.167 --> 00:27.250
I'll tie this to

You test my faith.

00:35.333 --> 00:36.917
And you're testing my patience.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.750
Now move on before
I decide to flunk out.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.708
Man, I can't believe we got

12:25.875 --> 12:27.458
Just dinner.

12:27.542 --> 12:30.083
[instrumental music]

12:32.542 --> 12:34.875
I'd give you my berth number

12:34.958 --> 12:37.917
but I suspect you already know
how to find me.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.667
Commander.

12:50.417 --> 12:52.833
Something, ambassador?

12:52.917 --> 12:55.500
Just thinking about last week.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.792
The unfortunate accident
with an air lock

12:57.875 --> 13:01.000
that caused the sudden demise
of my first aide Ko D'Ath.

13:01.083 --> 13:03.333
- Yes.
- Very sudden.

13:03.417 --> 13:06.167
Who did you say sponsored you
to be my attache?

13:06.250 --> 13:08.667
Counselor Li'Dak, Fifth Circle.

13:08.750 --> 13:11.500
Ah! then you must know
his own sponsor Du'Rog.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.458
Oh, no, I've never met him.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.375
You seem very certain about
someone you've never met.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.125
In all your dealings
with the Kha'Ri's

13:18.208 --> 13:19.750
isn't it possible
that you once met

13:19.833 --> 13:21.875
someone named Counselor Du'Rog?

13:21.958 --> 13:25.917
- Anything is possible.
- Yes! Anything.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.042
What would you say if I told you
that Counselor Du'Rog

13:28.125 --> 13:30.250
had hired someone to kill me?

13:30.333 --> 13:32.042
Someone close to me?

13:32.125 --> 13:35.000
Ambassador, with all due respect

13:35.083 --> 13:37.083
if it were me,
you wouldn't be here

13:37.167 --> 13:38.625
for us to have
this conversation.

13:38.708 --> 13:42.208
Except, of course, Du'Rog wants
to prolong my discomfort

13:42.292 --> 13:44.250
for the next 48 Earth hours.

13:44.333 --> 13:47.042
The last thing he wants
is a quick death.

13:47.125 --> 13:49.458
How can you be sure
there is an assassin onboard?

13:49.542 --> 13:51.708
What if he only told you this
to frighten you?

13:51.792 --> 13:53.042
Unlikely.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.833
Ah, as you said,
anything is possible.

13:55.917 --> 13:57.708
'If he wanted the best'

13:57.792 --> 13:59.792
he would have gone
to the assassin's guild

13:59.875 --> 14:01.417
to get a killer.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.250
It is a tradition
with the Thenta Makur

14:03.333 --> 14:06.750
to leave a black flower
near his victims as a warning

14:06.833 --> 14:08.167
'so they can get their affairs
in order.'

14:08.250 --> 14:11.417
'Have you received
a death blossom?'

14:11.500 --> 14:15.125
- No.
- Then I wouldn't worry.

14:15.208 --> 14:16.750
Get some sleep, ambassador.

14:16.833 --> 14:20.750
'I'm sure the question will
resolve itself soon enough.'

14:20.833 --> 14:23.875
[instrumental music]

14:43.042 --> 14:45.958
[sniffing]

14:48.167 --> 14:51.208
[screaming]

14:56.042 --> 14:57.458
[intense music]

14:58.958 --> 15:02.083
And you have no idea
how that got into my bed?

15:02.167 --> 15:04.667
Ambassador, it is
not my place to speculate

15:04.750 --> 15:06.708
on how anything
gets into your bed.

15:06.792 --> 15:10.167
Your reputed fascination
with Earth women, for instance.

15:10.250 --> 15:13.458
[chuckles]
If you're worried..

15:13.542 --> 15:14.625
...why don't you
go to the commander

15:14.708 --> 15:16.292
he could protect you.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.458
I fight my own battles.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.000
I survived our war of
independence

15:20.083 --> 15:21.292
five years on the council

15:21.375 --> 15:23.333
and two prior assassination
attempts.

15:23.417 --> 15:25.292
I can survive this!

15:25.375 --> 15:27.042
And asking for help
would require explaining

15:27.125 --> 15:29.333
why Counselor Du'Rog
wanted me dead.

15:29.417 --> 15:31.833
This would lead to some rather
unfortunate revelations

15:31.917 --> 15:33.500
about my years on the council.

15:33.583 --> 15:36.042
Revelations that could affect
my position.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.542
Ah!

15:37.625 --> 15:40.250
Personally, I don't care
if the information comes out.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.208
My only concern is that
it might compromise

15:42.292 --> 15:44.500
our standing
in the negotiations.

15:44.583 --> 15:46.875
So we have to
handle this quietly

15:46.958 --> 15:49.625
for the sake of
planetary security.

15:49.708 --> 15:50.917
Of course.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.708
Ambassador..

15:52.792 --> 15:54.500
If you suspect that I'm involved

15:54.583 --> 15:55.833
why're telling me all this?

15:55.917 --> 15:58.583
Earthers have a phrase,
"Keep your friends close

15:58.667 --> 16:00.167
and your enemies closer."

16:00.250 --> 16:01.875
Wonder if they stole it from us.

16:01.958 --> 16:05.208
Either way, I look forward to
strengthening our relationship.

16:05.292 --> 16:08.458
Now, I must find the courier
who brought me this message.

16:08.542 --> 16:09.750
I believe his name was Tu'Pari.

16:09.833 --> 16:11.917
I must find out
who gave it to him.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.042
Oh, he's probably left this
station by now.

16:14.125 --> 16:17.083
No ships for Narn have left
since yesterday afternoon.

16:17.167 --> 16:19.208
He's still here.

16:19.292 --> 16:22.042
Finding him
will be your first test.

16:22.125 --> 16:24.500
Meanwhile, I will arrange
for a little protection.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.083
I thought you weren't going to
tell the Earthers about this.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.292
(G'Kar)
'I'm not.'

16:31.083 --> 16:32.375
[door whirs]

16:34.292 --> 16:35.375
[door clanks]

16:37.375 --> 16:40.125
(male on PA)
'Earth Alliance transport
Southern Passage'

16:40.208 --> 16:42.792
'is in its final boarding stages
for departure'

16:42.875 --> 16:46.625
'to Arturas-Four
at boarding area One-Alpha.'

16:47.583 --> 16:50.708
[speaking in foreign language]

16:57.000 --> 16:58.542
Satai Delenn?

17:00.292 --> 17:03.167
Lennier of the Third Fane
of Chudomo.

17:03.250 --> 17:06.250
- I, I was sent..
- Yes.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.833
I've been expecting you.

17:11.042 --> 17:15.750
You can look up, Lennier
of the Third Fane of Chudomo.

17:15.833 --> 17:17.792
It is forbidden.

17:17.875 --> 17:20.083
I cannot have an aide
who will not look up.

17:20.167 --> 17:22.708
You will be forever
walking into things.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.083
Please.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.375
Better.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.458
Now, come.

17:41.042 --> 17:43.917
Forgive me if, if I am slow,
Satai Delenn

17:44.000 --> 17:47.958
but this is,
this's all quite new to me.

17:48.042 --> 17:51.167
To go from
a simple novitiate to..

17:51.250 --> 17:53.958
...to working with
one of the Grey Council.

17:54.042 --> 17:56.208
Your teachers spoke well of you.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.750
You will adjust.

17:58.958 --> 18:00.458
You can begin by promising

18:00.542 --> 18:04.833
not to mention the Grey Council
again during your stay.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.583
No one here knows
of my connection.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.667
No one must find out.

18:09.750 --> 18:13.083
- But to deny the council--
- I am denying nothing.

18:14.708 --> 18:16.125
But it would lead to
certain questions

18:16.208 --> 18:19.458
that I don't want to answer
just now.

18:19.542 --> 18:22.667
You will not use my title Satai.

18:22.750 --> 18:25.833
You will address me
only as Delenn.

18:25.917 --> 18:27.000
Do you understand?

18:27.083 --> 18:31.250
No, but understanding is
not required.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.583
- Only obedience.
- Good.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.208
Your arrival is well-timed.

18:35.292 --> 18:38.208
We are having an exchange of
ideas, displaying our rituals

18:38.292 --> 18:40.792
our religions
and our sacred days.

18:40.875 --> 18:44.208
You can help with demonstration
of Minbari religion.

18:44.292 --> 18:48.667
The Third Fane of Chudomo has
served with honor for 500 years.

18:48.750 --> 18:51.333
I will not disappoint you, Sat..

18:51.417 --> 18:53.417
Delenn.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.208
Then I am content.

18:56.292 --> 18:58.708
Now, tell me of home, Lennier.

18:58.792 --> 19:00.750
I have been away far too long.

19:00.833 --> 19:03.917
[instrumental music]

19:05.625 --> 19:09.875
- You wish protection?
- Yes.

19:09.958 --> 19:12.625
Mighty Narn Empire.

19:12.708 --> 19:15.125
Soldiers, guns.

19:15.208 --> 19:17.125
And you come to N'Grath?

19:17.208 --> 19:18.542
I need a bodyguard.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.500
Someone who isn't from
my own world.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.875
It avoids certain complications.

19:23.958 --> 19:27.708
- Expensive.
- Oh, just name your price.

19:27.792 --> 19:31.250
I have to attend the Minbari
ceremony in two Earth hours.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.167
Will you have someone by then?

19:33.250 --> 19:37.000
Is this satisfactory?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.083
[chuckling]
Oh, yes.

19:49.125 --> 19:51.417
(Catherine)
'It's been so long since
I've seen you out of uniform.'

19:51.500 --> 19:53.250
'that I almost forgot
what you look like.'

19:53.333 --> 19:55.417
'Isn't this a breach of
protocol?'

19:55.500 --> 19:56.792
(Sinclair)
'I'm off duty.'

19:56.875 --> 19:58.333
I thought you're never off duty.

19:58.417 --> 20:00.458
Maybe you didn't know me
as well as you think.

20:00.542 --> 20:02.542
You're right, I didn't.

20:02.625 --> 20:03.917
But whose fault was that?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.333
- Catherine--
- Commander, how are you, sir?

20:06.417 --> 20:09.000
- It's good to see you.
- And you.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.958
David will be your waiter
tonight.

20:11.042 --> 20:12.333
Thank you.

20:12.417 --> 20:14.750
I have to confess,
I was surprised to see you here.

20:14.833 --> 20:15.958
I don't see why.

20:16.042 --> 20:18.208
Seems like we
run into each other

20:18.292 --> 20:20.375
about every two or three years.

20:21.542 --> 20:23.792
Half the time,
I'm with someone else

20:23.875 --> 20:25.292
or you're with someone else,
the other half--

20:25.375 --> 20:28.125
The other half, the dance goes
something like this..

20:28.208 --> 20:29.792
We meet,
renew acquaintances

20:29.875 --> 20:32.000
talk about old times
at the academy.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.250
You ask about my aunt,
I ask about your brother.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.167
We lie about not missing
each other

20:36.250 --> 20:38.458
and we end up
in bed together.

20:38.542 --> 20:39.792
- And then you leave.
- Or you leave.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.250
- Last time it was you.
- No, it wasn't.

20:41.333 --> 20:44.000
- Yes, it was.
- No.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.417
Was it?

20:47.917 --> 20:49.583
You're right.

20:49.667 --> 20:51.667
Last time it was me.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.375
Oh, God, who can keep it all
straight anymore?

20:55.792 --> 20:59.250
Funny, I was just thinkin'
about you the other day.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.292
Wondering what you were doing.

21:01.375 --> 21:03.000
I usually think about you
in summer.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.042
I think of you in the fall.

21:05.125 --> 21:06.917
We never could agree on
anything.

21:08.375 --> 21:09.917
I still have your letters.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.333
The long battles,
the brief truces.

21:12.417 --> 21:16.000
The longer silences punctuated
by moments of passion

21:16.083 --> 21:18.333
that we both end up regretting.

21:18.417 --> 21:19.792
I read them from time to time

21:19.875 --> 21:23.000
to remind myself why
we shouldn't get together again.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.583
And why I shouldn't miss
bein' with you.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.167
I think we just jumped ahead.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.667
We're supposed to reminisce
about the academy

21:28.750 --> 21:30.708
and ask about old friends first,
remember?

21:30.792 --> 21:33.875
No, not this time. I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:33.958 --> 21:35.458
We're not good for each other.

21:35.542 --> 21:37.875
I know. It was always
three parts passion

21:37.958 --> 21:39.250
and two parts teeth with us,
wasn't it?

21:39.333 --> 21:41.375
Exactly.
Can't go through all that again.

21:41.458 --> 21:42.625
Agreed.

21:45.292 --> 21:48.625
- How's your aunt?
- How's your brother?

21:48.708 --> 21:51.750
[both laugh]

21:53.458 --> 21:55.417
Oh, God,
I can't believe I'm going

21:55.500 --> 21:57.500
through all this with you again.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.500
Neither can I.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.083
I see such trouble.

22:02.417 --> 22:05.750
(Delenn)
Will you follow me into fire?

22:05.833 --> 22:06.958
Into storm?

22:07.792 --> 22:09.292
Into darkness?

22:09.958 --> 22:11.042
Into death?

22:12.750 --> 22:17.333
And the nine said, "Yes."

22:17.417 --> 22:22.125
Then do this in testimony
to the one who will follow..

22:22.208 --> 22:27.000
...will bring death couched
in the promise of new life.

22:27.083 --> 22:31.500
'And renewal
disguised as defeat.'

22:31.583 --> 22:34.667
[instrumental music]

22:43.000 --> 22:44.917
'From birth..'

22:45.000 --> 22:48.292
'...through death and renewal.'

22:48.375 --> 22:52.250
'You must put aside
old things..'

22:52.333 --> 22:54.792
'...old fears..'

22:54.875 --> 22:56.833
'...old lives.'

22:59.292 --> 23:02.417
'This is your death.'

23:02.500 --> 23:05.083
'The death of flesh.'

23:05.167 --> 23:07.458
The death of pain.

23:07.542 --> 23:10.625
The death of yesterday.

23:15.708 --> 23:17.375
Taste of it..

23:19.708 --> 23:22.458
'...and be not afraid.'

23:22.542 --> 23:27.042
For I am with you
to the end of time.

23:37.042 --> 23:38.750
Taste of it.

23:42.167 --> 23:44.708
[music continues]

23:54.583 --> 23:56.042
And so..

23:57.625 --> 23:59.250
...it begins.

24:01.333 --> 24:03.125
[door whirs]

24:03.208 --> 24:04.417
Where is he?

24:04.500 --> 24:06.750
I was told a bodyguard
would be at the ceremony!

24:06.833 --> 24:08.500
- I was all alone!
- Ambassador..

24:08.583 --> 24:10.583
"Taste of your own death,"
indeed. It's the only--

24:10.667 --> 24:12.208
Ambassador!

24:12.292 --> 24:13.875
The other room.

24:15.708 --> 24:17.417
What in the world are you
doing here?

24:17.500 --> 24:20.583
You were supposed to meet me
at the Minbari ceremony!

24:20.667 --> 24:21.833
What'll I..

24:21.917 --> 24:23.292
[thuds]

24:23.375 --> 24:25.000
[intense music]

24:25.083 --> 24:26.292
[gasps]

24:28.292 --> 24:29.625
[instrumental music]

24:31.625 --> 24:33.083
Let me see
if I've got this straight..

24:33.167 --> 24:35.750
You just came in and found this
guy dead in your bedroom.

24:35.833 --> 24:37.542
That's right.

24:37.625 --> 24:39.583
And you've never seen him
before?

24:39.667 --> 24:41.167
You have no idea
what he was doing here.

24:41.250 --> 24:45.000
Yes! Yes! Look, we've already
gone over all this.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.792
Just tryin' to get your
story down, ambassador.

24:46.875 --> 24:49.083
It's not my story,
it's the truth!

24:49.167 --> 24:50.583
When this individual was killed

24:50.667 --> 24:54.208
I was at the Minbari ceremony
with you. Remember?

24:54.292 --> 24:55.875
Yeah, I remember.

24:55.958 --> 24:57.167
And I also remember you looking

24:57.250 --> 24:59.417
pretty distracted
the whole time.

25:09.167 --> 25:13.458
- Yours?
- Oh! Get out.

25:13.542 --> 25:14.917
Don't push, ambassador.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.458
Unless you've heard otherwise

25:16.542 --> 25:17.792
I'm still head of security.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.583
And under the terms
of our treaty

25:19.667 --> 25:22.542
diplomatic quarters
are considered foreign soil.

25:22.625 --> 25:24.417
Since I have
full diplomatic immunity

25:24.500 --> 25:27.292
I don't have to answer
any of your questions.

25:27.375 --> 25:28.958
I brought you here
as a courtesy.

25:29.042 --> 25:30.750
If I were you,
I'd spend a little more time

25:30.833 --> 25:32.833
finding out who killed
that individual

25:32.917 --> 25:34.333
and little less time

25:34.417 --> 25:37.708
engaging in your usual
harassment.

25:39.167 --> 25:41.167
You're right, ambassador.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.917
- My apologies.
- Ah.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.292
Let me know when you're
finished, I want a full report.

25:45.375 --> 25:47.125
Yes, sir.

25:47.208 --> 25:50.542
And just let me say, ambassador,
from the bottom of my heart

25:50.625 --> 25:52.708
hot pink is definitely
your color.

25:52.792 --> 25:54.500
Oh!

25:54.583 --> 25:56.792
[sighs]

25:56.875 --> 25:58.458
[indistinct chatter on PA]

25:59.958 --> 26:02.167
Are you Courier Tu'Pari?

26:02.250 --> 26:03.958
- Yes.
- Come with me.

26:04.042 --> 26:05.792
I'm needed on homeworld.

26:05.875 --> 26:08.625
- I have my orders.
- So do I.

26:08.708 --> 26:09.875
I'm already an hour late

26:09.958 --> 26:11.833
in bringing you to Ambassador
G'Kar.

26:11.917 --> 26:13.625
Which gives us something
in common.

26:13.708 --> 26:15.292
If you do not come with me

26:15.375 --> 26:17.958
you will be
the Late Courier Tu'Pari.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.167
(Catherine)
'And I came across another
likely candidate'

26:26.250 --> 26:27.333
'over in Grid Epsilon.'

26:27.417 --> 26:30.708
Coordinates 471-18-25.

26:30.792 --> 26:32.167
It's a Class Two planetoid.

26:32.250 --> 26:35.292
Not enough atmosphere to sustain
any kind of sentient life.

26:36.292 --> 26:37.250
Mineral content?

26:37.333 --> 26:39.708
High levels of platinum,
derinium.

26:39.792 --> 26:42.125
- You name it, it's there.
- 'Good.'

26:42.208 --> 26:43.750
We have some good news
by the way.

26:43.833 --> 26:46.542
Yes, you hit the big time.

26:47.625 --> 26:49.375
I don't understand.

26:49.458 --> 26:51.625
(male #2)
'The last planet
that you surveyed for us'

26:51.708 --> 26:54.333
'turned up a substantial
amount of quantium 40.'

26:54.417 --> 26:56.292
Yes. And under the terms
of the contract

26:56.375 --> 27:00.417
you are entitled
to a piece of the profit..

27:00.500 --> 27:02.583
And..

27:02.667 --> 27:04.125
How's that look to you?

27:05.792 --> 27:08.375
Oh! Oh, my!

27:08.458 --> 27:11.000
Well, we've got to catch
our next flight back to Earth.

27:11.083 --> 27:14.250
'I imagine you'll want to
celebrating your good fortune.'

27:14.333 --> 27:15.542
Good day, Ms. Sakai.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.250
We'll see you back at the hub.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.375
(Catherine)
Right. Thanks.

27:21.125 --> 27:22.500
[exhales]

27:26.917 --> 27:28.208
Cheers!

27:31.583 --> 27:32.792
[door beeping]

27:32.875 --> 27:33.792
Come.

27:33.875 --> 27:34.958
[door whirs]

27:36.625 --> 27:39.625
The Courier Tu'Pari, ambassador,
as you requested.

27:39.708 --> 27:41.042
Ah, good.

27:41.125 --> 27:44.583
I do wish to speak to him alone
if you don't mind, Na'Toth.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.583
[gasps]

27:49.667 --> 27:51.375
Who gave you the data crystal

27:51.458 --> 27:53.333
that you delivered to me
yesterday?

27:53.417 --> 27:55.667
The message was from
Counselor Du'Rog.

27:55.750 --> 27:56.958
Du'Rog is dead!

27:57.042 --> 28:00.750
Someone had to give it to you
on his orders. Who?

28:00.833 --> 28:02.750
Counselor Shu'Toth.

28:06.042 --> 28:09.417
The father of my attache
Na'Toth?

28:09.500 --> 28:12.083
The danger is much closer to you

28:12.167 --> 28:14.875
than you think, ambassador.

28:14.958 --> 28:19.083
(male #3)
'I am become a name for always
roaming with a hungry heart.'

28:19.167 --> 28:22.833
'Much have I seen and known,
cities of men and manners.'

28:22.917 --> 28:24.417
'Climates, councils,
governments.'

28:24.500 --> 28:27.208
'Myself not least,
but honored of them all.'

28:27.292 --> 28:30.333
'And drunk delight of battle
with my peers..'

28:30.417 --> 28:31.625
Pause.

28:33.208 --> 28:34.167
Come.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.792
[door whirs]

28:35.875 --> 28:38.625
Do you know how expensive
things are in this station?

28:38.708 --> 28:41.000
Five hundred credits
just for a loaf of bread

28:41.083 --> 28:43.833
a jug of wine
and some Antarean flarn.

28:43.917 --> 28:44.875
Catherine.

28:44.958 --> 28:46.500
I just got some terrific news

28:46.583 --> 28:49.542
and I'm tired of not having
anyone to share it with.

28:50.833 --> 28:52.250
Tennyson?

28:52.333 --> 28:55.125
Jeff, you've been caught on
that one since the academy.

28:55.208 --> 28:57.708
What's it take to drag you
into the 23rd century?

28:57.792 --> 28:59.500
We find meaning where we can.

28:59.583 --> 29:01.750
Ah! And which are you?

29:01.833 --> 29:05.750
"An idle king doling
unequal laws unto a savage race

29:05.833 --> 29:09.292
that hoard and sleep and feed
and know not you?"

29:09.375 --> 29:12.667
Or "This gray spirit yearning

29:12.750 --> 29:16.458
"in desire to follow
knowledge like a..

29:16.542 --> 29:17.833
...sinking star."

29:17.917 --> 29:19.833
I didn't know
you'd memorized it.

29:19.917 --> 29:22.542
I lived with you for a year.
I didn't have much choice.

29:22.625 --> 29:24.500
Do you have something to open
this with?

29:24.583 --> 29:27.375
Catherine, I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

29:27.458 --> 29:29.875
- Don't do this to me.
- We just got over each other.

29:29.958 --> 29:31.792
Who says?

29:31.875 --> 29:35.000
Who says I got over you
and you got over me?

29:35.083 --> 29:37.792
You don't just turn it off
like a switch.

29:37.875 --> 29:40.042
Yes, I stopped sleeping on
just one side of the bed

29:40.125 --> 29:42.625
but only because
you weren't there.

29:42.708 --> 29:44.792
I'd think about you
and get angry at myself

29:44.875 --> 29:47.333
for being a fool.

29:47.417 --> 29:49.167
And then,
when I saw you yesterday. I..

29:49.250 --> 29:50.625
What do you want from me?

29:52.042 --> 29:53.750
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.333
I don't know anything anymore.

29:56.417 --> 29:59.833
I just didn't want to
celebrate alone.

29:59.917 --> 30:03.958
Maybe I needed you.
Maybe I just needed someone.

30:04.042 --> 30:08.125
And right now,
for this one moment

30:08.208 --> 30:09.833
I don't care.

30:12.292 --> 30:13.958
Don't send me away.

30:15.292 --> 30:17.375
Don't make me feel like a fool.

30:17.458 --> 30:18.667
I couldn't do that.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.125
[sighs]

30:20.208 --> 30:22.875
You have to know me
better than that.

30:22.958 --> 30:24.125
(female #2)
'Commander.'

30:25.375 --> 30:26.875
That's alright. Go.

30:30.458 --> 30:32.083
Yes?

30:32.167 --> 30:34.458
(female #2)
'We've got an environmental
brownout in Green-Two.'

30:34.542 --> 30:37.083
'We need authorization to
reroute power from sensors'

30:37.167 --> 30:38.458
'until we fix the couplers.'

30:38.542 --> 30:40.792
Fine, fine.
Authorization granted.

30:40.875 --> 30:42.083
[beeping]

30:42.167 --> 30:45.042
I should go. I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have come.

30:45.125 --> 30:46.083
Catherine..

30:46.167 --> 30:47.500
You can have the flarn,
I never--

30:47.583 --> 30:48.833
Don't.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.125
Don't touch me
unless you mean it.

30:52.208 --> 30:55.292
[instrumental music]

31:06.625 --> 31:09.417
And I wish to formally request
that my attache Na'Toth

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
be reassigned immediately
to another sector.

31:11.583 --> 31:14.250
I want her picked up
at transport within the hour.

31:14.333 --> 31:17.625
Confirmed, ambassador. I've been
told to convey our apologies

31:17.708 --> 31:18.708
for the delay in dispatches.

31:18.792 --> 31:20.167
What delay?

31:20.250 --> 31:22.792
Our courier, Ru'Dak,
met with an unfortunate accident

31:22.875 --> 31:25.333
the day he was scheduled
to leave for Babylon 5.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.125
We have not yet found
a replacement.

31:27.208 --> 31:28.208
What're you talking about?

31:28.292 --> 31:30.208
The courier is right here. I..

31:33.292 --> 31:35.208
[G'Kar groans]

31:37.208 --> 31:39.917
[instrumental music]

31:49.833 --> 31:51.208
[sighing]

31:52.583 --> 31:55.000
You should sleep.

31:55.083 --> 31:58.292
- You'll have to get up soon.
- I'm fine.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.125
It's been a long road,
hasn't it?

32:01.208 --> 32:04.000
- Hm.
- The academy.

32:04.083 --> 32:05.500
The war.

32:05.583 --> 32:09.583
And here we are, making the same
mistakes all over again.

32:09.667 --> 32:11.250
I don't know.

32:11.333 --> 32:12.625
Maybe.

32:15.042 --> 32:16.667
Maybe not.

32:18.250 --> 32:20.542
Well, at least we have tonight.

32:22.125 --> 32:25.458
In a few hours, you'll be
the busy commander again.

32:25.542 --> 32:27.708
So let's enjoy it while we can.

32:29.125 --> 32:32.417
If there were a problem,
they'd tell you.

32:36.958 --> 32:39.208
[music continues]

32:48.375 --> 32:51.833
(Tu'Pari)
Ah, you're awake.

32:51.917 --> 32:53.167
Good.

32:53.250 --> 32:56.375
That will make this
far more entertaining.

32:56.458 --> 32:58.542
[screaming]

32:58.625 --> 33:01.708
[electricity crackling]

33:03.792 --> 33:06.500
Those are pain-givers on your

33:06.583 --> 33:08.875
neck and wrists, ambassador.

33:08.958 --> 33:12.667
If you come within ten feet
of me while wearing them

33:12.750 --> 33:15.083
'you will experience pain'

33:15.167 --> 33:17.708
'such as you cannot conceive.'

33:17.792 --> 33:21.792
Come within five feet,
and they will kill you.

33:21.875 --> 33:24.042
Wha.. What do you want?

33:24.125 --> 33:26.417
(Tu'Pari)
'My orders are quite specific.'

33:26.500 --> 33:27.625
[clears throat]

33:31.333 --> 33:32.667
Now..

33:33.625 --> 33:36.250
"You are to know pain.

33:36.333 --> 33:37.917
[electricity crackling]

33:38.000 --> 33:40.917
[groaning]

33:42.042 --> 33:42.958
[chuckles]

33:43.042 --> 33:45.583
"You are to know fear.

33:45.667 --> 33:50.167
And then you are to die
at the required hour."

33:50.250 --> 33:54.917
I confess, I'll be happy when
this assignment is finished.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.042
Allaying the target's suspicions
can be so time-consuming.

33:59.125 --> 34:02.917
Do you have any idea how long
I sat in the customs area

34:03.000 --> 34:05.208
waiting for Na'Toth to find me?

34:05.292 --> 34:07.875
Whatever you want,
whatever you were paid..

34:07.958 --> 34:09.167
Whatever the price..

34:09.250 --> 34:12.083
- I can double it!
- Yes.

34:12.167 --> 34:16.458
I imagined you could make me
extremely wealthy.

34:16.542 --> 34:18.667
But to betray a commission

34:18.750 --> 34:22.083
would violate the spirit of the
Thenta Makur

34:22.167 --> 34:25.458
and then they would
have to kill me.

34:25.542 --> 34:29.125
It's unfortunate,
but we must all

34:29.208 --> 34:32.250
make our little sacrifices,
ambassador.

34:32.333 --> 34:34.625
I have made mine..

34:34.708 --> 34:38.167
And you are about to make yours.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.292
[electricity crackling]

34:39.375 --> 34:40.833
[groaning]

34:40.917 --> 34:41.958
No!

34:44.417 --> 34:45.542
[door whirs]

34:46.583 --> 34:48.833
Ambassador?

34:48.917 --> 34:50.833
Ambassador G'Kar?

34:52.125 --> 34:54.667
[intense music]

35:06.875 --> 35:10.000
Re-establish contact
with last transmission.

35:10.083 --> 35:12.667
(computer)
'Confirmed. Stand by.'

35:12.750 --> 35:14.083
[electricity crackling]

35:14.167 --> 35:17.875
[chuckles softly]
The pain must be overwhelming.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.417
Why hold it in?

35:20.500 --> 35:22.667
Cry out, ambassador.

35:22.750 --> 35:25.292
'With luck,
someone will hear you.'

35:25.375 --> 35:30.208
I would die before giving you..

35:30.292 --> 35:32.375
...that satisfaction.

35:32.458 --> 35:34.083
As you wish.

35:34.167 --> 35:36.208
[electricity crackling]

35:36.292 --> 35:39.292
[groaning]

35:40.458 --> 35:43.500
[electricity crackling]

35:48.208 --> 35:49.375
Na'Toth!

35:49.458 --> 35:52.042
I'm glad to see my instincts
were correct.

35:52.125 --> 35:54.875
I knew you'd need complete
privacy for this.

35:54.958 --> 35:57.042
So once I determined
which of the transport tubes

35:57.125 --> 35:58.958
had suddenly broken down

35:59.042 --> 36:01.333
it wasn't hard to
figure out where you were.

36:01.417 --> 36:04.042
This is none of your affair,
Na'Toth.

36:04.125 --> 36:06.625
Leave while you can.

36:06.708 --> 36:09.833
Not until I've done
what I came here to do.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.417
I'm your backup, Tu'Pari.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.750
Hired to finish the job
in case you fail.

36:15.833 --> 36:18.583
I wasn't told about a backup.

36:18.667 --> 36:22.000
No, the primary never is.

36:22.083 --> 36:24.417
Standard practice
in the assassin's guild

36:24.500 --> 36:25.667
as you well know.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.667
Why should I believe you?

36:29.000 --> 36:32.333
(Na'Toth)
Hmm. I see you're using
pain-givers.

36:32.417 --> 36:35.250
Crude. Unimaginative.

36:35.333 --> 36:36.833
And much too quick.

36:36.917 --> 36:39.625
Our orders were to prolong
his discomfort every moment

36:39.708 --> 36:41.000
until the deadline.

36:41.083 --> 36:43.750
And what would you recommend?

36:47.875 --> 36:50.708
[breathing heavily]

36:50.792 --> 36:54.250
- Na'Toth!
- At your service, ambassador.

36:55.208 --> 36:58.125
[groaning]

37:06.167 --> 37:09.125
[gas whooshing]

37:13.875 --> 37:15.625
(Tu'Pari)
'And this is the part'

37:15.708 --> 37:18.417
where I'm supposed to decide
I trust you

37:18.500 --> 37:22.083
drop my guard and let you
shoot me in the back.

37:22.167 --> 37:25.958
Sorry, but I can't take
the chance that you're lying.

37:26.042 --> 37:28.458
You're making a mistake.

37:28.542 --> 37:29.458
Perhaps.

37:29.542 --> 37:30.833
[gas whooshing]

37:34.750 --> 37:37.750
[grunting]

37:43.875 --> 37:45.458
[screaming]

37:45.542 --> 37:46.583
[groaning]

37:54.750 --> 37:56.375
That hurt.

37:56.458 --> 38:00.167
Ambassador, it was the only way
to disable the pain-givers.

38:00.250 --> 38:02.458
I had to hit them
as hard as possible

38:02.542 --> 38:04.833
as often as possible,
and still make it appear

38:04.917 --> 38:07.292
as though I were beating you
into another incarnation.

38:07.375 --> 38:10.000
And you didn't enjoy it
in the least?

38:10.083 --> 38:11.458
I didn't say that.

38:13.042 --> 38:14.958
What are you going to do
with Tu'Pari?

38:15.042 --> 38:17.750
[chuckling]

38:22.458 --> 38:24.833
Well, well,
you're finally awake.

38:24.917 --> 38:25.958
[gasps]

38:26.750 --> 38:27.875
I was afraid the injection

38:27.958 --> 38:30.042
wouldn't wear off
for another day or so.

38:30.125 --> 38:31.792
Another-another day?

38:31.875 --> 38:35.125
It's been nearly 72 Earth hours
since you were knocked out.

38:35.208 --> 38:37.500
You missed your deadline.
Most unfortunate.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.042
'But to make up for it,
I went ahead'

38:39.125 --> 38:41.375
and deposited a substantial
amount of money

38:41.458 --> 38:43.750
to your personal account
back home.

38:43.833 --> 38:44.875
No!

38:44.958 --> 38:46.292
The Thenta Makur..

38:46.375 --> 38:49.125
...they'll think I betrayed
my commission

38:49.208 --> 38:52.000
sold out our principles.

38:52.083 --> 38:53.625
They will kill me.

38:53.708 --> 38:55.708
Yes, they will, won't they?

38:55.792 --> 38:57.875
I imagine
they're already on their way.

38:57.958 --> 39:00.292
Actually, they should be here
in about one hour.

39:00.375 --> 39:02.083
'It would be even more
unfortunate'

39:02.167 --> 39:04.250
if they were to find you here
when they arrived.

39:04.333 --> 39:06.750
(G'Kar)
'Oh, yes. Happily, I'm safe'

39:06.833 --> 39:08.583
because the commission was
yours alone.

39:08.667 --> 39:10.792
And they're so scandalized
by your actions

39:10.875 --> 39:12.875
that they'd just as soon forget
the whole thing never happened.

39:12.958 --> 39:14.458
Except for the part
about killing him.

39:14.542 --> 39:16.333
Except for that, yes.

39:16.417 --> 39:20.208
(male on PA)
'Alpha- Seven Transport
now departing from Bay-Three.'

39:20.292 --> 39:23.250
'Passengers will please begin
boarding procedure.'

39:23.333 --> 39:25.833
That's your flight.
I suggest you board quickly.

39:25.917 --> 39:27.500
With luck,
they may never find you.

39:27.583 --> 39:29.917
But if they do,
you will know pain.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.125
- And you will know fear.
- And then you'll die.

39:32.208 --> 39:34.125
Have a pleasant flight.

39:34.208 --> 39:37.167
[instrumental music]

39:45.167 --> 39:47.208
(G'Kar)
'And when-when you took his
sp-spectacles'

39:47.292 --> 39:49.250
and smashed them on the floor,
I thought..

39:49.333 --> 39:51.750
Ambassador, enjoying the last
day of the festival?

39:51.833 --> 39:54.708
More than you could possibly
imagine. Good day.

39:54.792 --> 39:56.167
[both laughing]

39:56.250 --> 39:58.083
He's in a good mood.
Who knows?

39:58.167 --> 40:01.583
Maybe Earth Central was right
about this festival idea.

40:01.667 --> 40:04.208
I can't believe how quiet
it's been the last day or so.

40:04.292 --> 40:07.000
Guess I'm your good-luck charm.

40:07.083 --> 40:08.542
You sure you have to go?

40:08.625 --> 40:10.333
Oh, it's just for a few days.

40:10.417 --> 40:11.542
I have to make survey run

40:11.625 --> 40:13.417
through the Deneb sector
by next Tuesday

40:13.500 --> 40:15.458
or I lose the commission.

40:15.542 --> 40:17.208
See you when I get back?

40:17.292 --> 40:20.375
- I'm not leaving this time.
- Neither am I.

40:20.458 --> 40:21.792
This should be interesting.

40:21.875 --> 40:23.708
[chuckling]

40:23.792 --> 40:25.833
So have you figured out yet
what you're gonna do for

40:25.917 --> 40:29.000
demonstration of Earth's
dominant belief system?

40:29.083 --> 40:31.000
Not yet, and I don't know
how I'm gonna top

40:31.083 --> 40:33.167
the Minbari rituals,
the bells, drums

40:33.250 --> 40:36.000
robes and little pieces
of fruit.

40:36.083 --> 40:39.417
- Red fruit?
- Yeah.

40:39.500 --> 40:43.042
And was there a serious
exchange of looks?

40:43.125 --> 40:44.667
Yes.

40:44.750 --> 40:47.042
It's supposed to be part
of the rebirth ceremony.

40:48.417 --> 40:50.042
What?

40:50.125 --> 40:53.167
[chuckles]
Oh, it's a rebirth ceremony,
alright.

40:53.250 --> 40:56.000
It also doubles
as a marriage ceremony.

40:56.083 --> 40:59.042
Depending on how seriously
anyone took it.

40:59.125 --> 41:01.333
Somebody got married
the other day.

41:01.417 --> 41:04.083
Maybe that's why
G'Kar's smiling.

41:04.167 --> 41:06.833
Funny. I didn't think
Londo was his type.

41:07.958 --> 41:10.542
[instrumental music]

41:13.250 --> 41:16.333
- See you next Wednesday?
- Try and stop me.

41:20.625 --> 41:21.750
Jeff?

41:23.125 --> 41:25.417
You think we'll get it right
this time?

41:25.500 --> 41:26.792
I don't know.

41:27.917 --> 41:29.667
Fair enough.

41:39.625 --> 41:41.958
[instrumental music]

41:46.167 --> 41:48.958
- Mr. Garibaldi!
- I know.

41:49.042 --> 41:51.458
He said it'd be
just a few more minutes.

41:51.542 --> 41:53.458
Exactly what sort of
demonstration

41:53.542 --> 41:54.750
does he have planned?

41:54.833 --> 41:56.250
Unknown.
He wouldn't even tell us.

41:56.333 --> 41:58.542
Just said it'd showcase
Earth's dominant belief system.

41:58.625 --> 42:01.958
- I don't hear any drums.
- Or bells.

42:02.042 --> 42:03.250
Or chants.

42:03.333 --> 42:05.125
Are you're sure that we've come
to the right place?

42:05.208 --> 42:07.250
That's it, I'm leaving.

42:07.333 --> 42:08.917
This is where he said to wait

42:09.000 --> 42:10.333
and this is where we're waiting.

42:10.417 --> 42:12.833
Alright, we're all set.

42:12.917 --> 42:14.083
If you'll come this way.

42:15.292 --> 42:16.708
Here.

42:19.792 --> 42:22.333
This is Mr. Harris.
He's an atheist.

42:22.417 --> 42:25.292
Father Cresanti,
a Roman Catholic.

42:25.375 --> 42:27.875
Mr. Hayakawa, a Zen Buddhist.

'Isnakuma, a Bantu.'

42:53.958 --> 42:56.500
'Ms. Chang, a Taoist.'

'Mr. Blacksmith, an aborigine.'

'Ms. Yamamoto, a Shinto.'
