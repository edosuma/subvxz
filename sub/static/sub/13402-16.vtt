’Pretz‘y Little Liars. . ”

00:03.000 --> 00:04.888
"Solve the puzzle
and get away with murder."

00:04.930 --> 00:06.261
"Or fail and go directly
to jail."

00:06.300 --> 00:07.494
Cops get one more clue
about what we did..

00:07.540 --> 00:08.461
It's game over.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.728
All that talk
about Lucas backing you

00:09.770 --> 00:11.135
all the way, he's selling
your business out

00:11.170 --> 00:12.432
from under you
before we've even started.

00:12.470 --> 00:14.028
- "Arcturus."
- Hanna.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.071
Lucas and Charles
made this together?

00:16.110 --> 00:17.634
Yes, and Lucas kept it.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.001
It’s gone. Whoever took it
knew where to look

00:20.050 --> 00:21.938
( woman on phone)
You 7/ do as you ’re to/o’.
And don ’t forget about Ezra.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.210
He's just a document away
from going to prison.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.309
Mona, hurry.
I brought you here to help me.

00:26.350 --> 00:28.386
My turn is next.
We have to shut this thing down.

00:28.420 --> 00:29.557
I'm going to have the baby.

00:29.590 --> 00:31.148
- Oh, we'll do it.
- Together.

00:31.190 --> 00:33.021
Did you know that Dunhill
was at the Radley bar

00:33.060 --> 00:34.482
the same night that we were?

00:34.530 --> 00:35.758
- What were you doing tonight?
- Burying a body.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.290
- No.
- Maybe he wasn't after all..

00:37.330 --> 00:38.797
But his credit card was.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.627
I requested paper rece/jots
from the hotel.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.763
I ’m interested in seeing
a signature on that h/ii.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.405
Once that happens,
there's gonna be more questions.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.304
Why didn't you come
to the Radley hotel that night?

00:49.340 --> 00:51.137
My friend Emily was working
and I wanted a drink.

00:51.180 --> 00:52.499
And did you see Archer Dunhill?

00:52.550 --> 00:54.472
- I knew him as Ellio_t Rollins.
- Did you see him?

00:54.520 --> 00:56.340
No. But that doesn't mean
that he wasn't there.

00:56.380 --> 00:57.938
What time did you leave
the bar with Detective Furey?

00:57.990 --> 01:00.242
- I knew him as Marco.
- 'What time did you leave?‘

01:00.290 --> 01:01.609
I don't know, 11:00?

01:01.660 --> 01:03.389
Don't you have
surveillance footage of me?

01:03.430 --> 01:06.251
Do you remember, uh, a joke
you made to Detective Furey?

01:06.290 --> 01:07.848
About burying a body?

01:07.900 --> 01:11.529
No, but I do remember unbuckling
his belt in the elevator.

01:15.370 --> 01:16.667
Did you pay for your drinks?

01:16.710 --> 01:18.530
You've asked me this question
three times.

01:18.570 --> 01:21.107
If you could just answer
the question.

01:22.180 --> 01:23.579
I told you
I got the second round.

01:23.610 --> 01:25.749
What time would you have
paid for the drinks?

01:25.780 --> 01:27.998
Video surveillance shows you
paying at around 10:45.

01:28.050 --> 01:29.642
- Is that right?
- Yes, could be.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.147
- You paid with your own card?
- 'Yes.‘

01:31.190 --> 01:32.509
Which of your cards
did you pay with?

01:32.550 --> 01:33.778
- I don't remember.
- What was the amount?

01:33.820 --> 01:35.458
- I don't recall.
- 'Was it $79?‘

01:35.490 --> 01:36.787
- I don't recall.
- 'What was-—'

01:36.830 --> 01:38.229
I don't recall!

01:38.260 --> 01:40.080
[instrumental music]

01:40.130 --> 01:43.122
You may wanna wait for me
to ask the question first.

01:44.870 --> 01:46.861
(male #1 on speaker)
'That's enough for now, Barry.‘

02:04.090 --> 02:05.887
[music continues]

02:18.700 --> 02:20.099
You okay?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.960
Sort of like setting fire
to my house

02:22.000 --> 02:23.558
and then asking if I'm too warm.

02:23.610 --> 02:26.761
Spencer, I can't help you
unless you tell me the truth.

02:26.810 --> 02:28.573
Really?

02:28.610 --> 02:30.578
You wanna pull
good cop, bad cop on me?

02:30.610 --> 02:33.443
Please. You are standing
on quick sand.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.016
The more you struggle,
the faster

02:35.050 --> 02:36.415
it's gonna pull you under.

02:36.450 --> 02:39.783
I'm offering you a rope.
Take it.

02:39.820 --> 02:42.516
[music continues]

03:00.240 --> 03:02.276
Can I go home now?

03:07.850 --> 03:11.377
Please, do yourself a favor
and get a lavwer.

03:11.420 --> 03:12.682
Two days from now,
I'm gonna have

03:12.720 --> 03:14.278
Rollins' credit card slip
in my hand.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.288
And if your signature
is on it

03:16.320 --> 03:18.686
a warrant for your arrest.

03:18.730 --> 03:21.654
[dramatic music]

03:23.830 --> 03:26.321
Got a secret_
can you keep It?

03:26.370 --> 03:29.134
Swear this one you'll save

03:29.170 --> 03:31.331
Better lock it
in your pocket

03:31.370 --> 03:34.168
Taking this one
to the grave

03:34.210 --> 03:36.132
If I show you
then I know

03:36.180 --> 03:39.001
You won't tell what I said

03:39.050 --> 03:41.575
'Cause two can keep a secret

03:41.620 --> 03:44.646
If one of them is dead

03:48.690 --> 03:51.181
Em, this really
isn't helping my nausea.

03:51.230 --> 03:54.324
Oh, sorry, okay,
you can open your eyes now.

03:55.730 --> 03:57.152
(Ali)
'When did you do this?‘

03:57.200 --> 04:00.124
[sighs]
Look, I know
it's a little early

04:00.170 --> 04:02.764
and I know it's not going
to be a permanent situation

04:02.800 --> 04:05.860
but I just figured
while the baby is here, that--

04:05.910 --> 04:07.366
Em, stop.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.977
This is great.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.019
And you can stay
as long as you want.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.540
Really?

04:16.580 --> 04:19.879
Yeah, I mean,
it...just makes sense.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.854
At least for a little while.

04:25.290 --> 04:28.020
Where did you find all this?

04:28.060 --> 04:30.199
Uh, your attic.

04:30.230 --> 04:31.697
'And, sorry, I didn't ask first'

04:31.730 --> 04:34.290
but last week was so crazy,
I just wanted

04:34.340 --> 04:37.036
to put my energy
into something positive.

04:37.070 --> 04:38.367
I remember these.

04:38.410 --> 04:40.537
Your mom saved a lot.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.231
She packed everything
in tissue paper.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.077
Even your baby clothes.

04:45.110 --> 04:47.203
Well, for all of her faults

04:47.250 --> 04:49.275
she had good taste, didn't she?

04:53.520 --> 04:57.911
Rule number one,
never send me to voice mail.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.723
- Hey.
- Good morning.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.022
Is it?

05:04.070 --> 05:06.163
I think you were having some
serious nightmares last night

05:06.200 --> 05:07.497
you were really
tossing and turning.

05:07.540 --> 05:10.293
No, I was probably
just restless.

05:10.340 --> 05:12.558
Well, I think I have
a solution to that.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.677
Take a look at these.

05:15.710 --> 05:17.598
- Ballroom dancing classes?
- Yep.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.676
Salsa, Tango, Waltz,
take your pick.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.517
Since when do you
like to dance?

05:22.550 --> 05:25.439
I don't, but unless you want
our first dance together

05:25.490 --> 05:27.583
as a married couple,
to be the electric slide

05:27.620 --> 05:29.815
I should probably learn.

05:29.860 --> 05:33.785
So, when are you free?
I will sign us up.

05:33.830 --> 05:35.457
Um..

05:37.030 --> 05:38.964
I don't know,
I'm not really sure

05:39.000 --> 05:39.898
about my schedule right now.

05:39.930 --> 05:41.420
Oh, well, I mean
any night you want

05:41.470 --> 05:42.664
they pretty much
have classes going-—

05:42.700 --> 05:45.100
Yeah, I just
can't commit, okay?

05:45.140 --> 05:46.664
[cell phone buzzing]

05:50.480 --> 05:52.641
- I've to go.
- Okay.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.806
Well, we'll figure this out.

05:53.850 --> 05:54.874
And, actually,
I've to go meet Jillian

05:54.920 --> 05:56.444
to talk
about a press schedule.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.517
- Okay.
- Hey, are you sure you're okay?

05:59.550 --> 06:00.915
You're not still upset
with me about--

06:00.960 --> 06:02.609
No, promise.

06:03.830 --> 06:07.027
He doesn't have anything
on you, right?

06:07.060 --> 06:08.618
He does.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.025
'Because that night,
I got drunk at the Radley'

06:10.060 --> 06:12.460
and I used Rollins'
credit card by mistake.

06:14.340 --> 06:15.739
You got drunk?

06:16.670 --> 06:18.137
W-what about our timeline?

06:18.170 --> 06:19.569
For all the cops know
Dunhill could have

06:19.610 --> 06:20.838
actually been in that bar.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.700
No, they have me
on surveillance.

06:22.740 --> 06:25.140
They can't see the card, so they
need my slip with the signature

06:25.180 --> 06:27.102
on it, and they're gonna
have that in a few days.

06:28.850 --> 06:31.648
- You screw anything else up?
- No.

06:31.690 --> 06:33.214
How would you know?
You were trashed.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.979
Anyone one of us could have
made a mistake that night.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.284
That's my point, Emily.
Now, they're gonna be looking.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.719
And I'm the one who turned
Dunhill into roadkill.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.024
Spencer, why the hell
were you drunk?

06:42.060 --> 06:44.051
'Cause I was upset.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.967
And from what I remember,
you had a pretty good view.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.558
(Emily)
'I-if that signature disappears'

06:48.600 --> 06:51.831
then, so does
Furey's proof, right?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.735
Well, I was pushing Moscow Mules
at the Radley for a while

06:53.780 --> 06:55.304
I know where all
the paper work IS.

06:55.340 --> 06:57.331
I mean, the codes on the doors
change weekly, but--

06:57.380 --> 06:59.371
I can get them.

06:59.410 --> 07:01.298
My mom's office.

07:01.350 --> 07:03.716
- What if someone sees you?
- What if Lucas sees you?

07:03.750 --> 07:05.843
Can we not go there right now?

07:05.890 --> 07:07.846
(Emily)
'Tomorrow night
is the weekly staff meeting.‘

07:07.890 --> 07:10.017
The entire Radley crew
is held hostage in a room

07:10.060 --> 07:11.687
for an hour
and told to smile more.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.857
Even if no one
in the hotel sees her

07:13.900 --> 07:15.697
the security cameras will.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.856
No, they won't.

07:19.230 --> 07:22.495
We thought we'd start things off
with the press event here.

07:22.540 --> 07:23.996
In your book store.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.634
- Tomorrow night's event--
- What is this, Jillian?

07:27.440 --> 07:28.805
It's a press packet.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.376
Those are talking points
we'd like you to consider—-

07:30.410 --> 07:33.538
But every single one
is about Nicole.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.912
Um, how we fell in love,
Nicole's disappearance

07:35.950 --> 07:37.815
Nicole's rescue,
our reunion.

07:37.850 --> 07:39.545
That is what the book is about?

07:39.590 --> 07:42.115
Nicole. Nicole and you.

07:42.160 --> 07:46.722
Oh, right, but how is Aria
supposed to address any of this.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.194
Why don't we talk about, uh,
the—the writing process?

07:49.230 --> 07:53.621
Ezra, I understand
your life is...your life.

07:53.670 --> 07:56.594
But you wrote a book about
losing the woman you loved

07:56.640 --> 07:58.096
and then she was found.

07:58.140 --> 08:00.131
I'd have to be the dumbest
publisher since Gutenberg

08:00.170 --> 08:02.206
put ink to paper ifI didn't
take advantage of that.

08:02.240 --> 08:06.244
Look, Aria created Nicole
in the book, and--

08:06.280 --> 08:10.569
Everyone at the company respects
Aria's contribution, but..

08:11.450 --> 08:13.281
But what?

08:13.320 --> 08:14.912
For goodness sake, Ezra

08:14.960 --> 08:16.985
you couldn't have waited
till after the book launch

08:17.030 --> 08:18.918
to get engaged?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.757
(Caleb)
'It won't be a problem
shutting it down.‘

08:20.800 --> 08:23.018
Ashley hired me to create
the entire security system.

08:23.060 --> 08:24.220
Oh, thank God.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.830
But I can't do it
for more than ten minutes.

08:26.870 --> 08:29.566
Wait, what? What kind
of crappy system did you create?

08:29.600 --> 08:30.794
It's a safety feature.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.159
'If it's shut down
for much longer'

08:32.210 --> 08:34.531
then the security company
is alerted.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.673
[sighs]
My head hurts.

08:36.710 --> 08:38.849
[buzzing]

08:40.720 --> 08:43.518
No, no, no. Not now.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.878
[telephone rings]

08:50.560 --> 08:53.859
(Hanna)
"'Pick up my homework
or go to detention.‘

08:53.900 --> 08:56.698
Remember, prison food
makes you fat."

09:00.340 --> 09:02.433
(Alison)
'What does A.D. want
from a computer shop?‘

09:02.470 --> 09:04.267
(Hanna)
'1 don't know,
but whatever it is'

09:04.310 --> 09:06.301
'I'll have to bring it
to the school.‘

09:06.340 --> 09:08.137
[intense music]

09:12.150 --> 09:13.708
I don't even know
why we're fighting about this.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.843
- I'm going with you.
- No, you can't.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.279
I have to go alone,
I have no choice.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.878
You don't _even know what
you're getting yourself Into.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.285
It doesn't matter, alright?

09:20.320 --> 09:22.413
If I don't play this game,
bad things happen.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.587
Like you winding up
in the ER.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.086
What are you supposed
to pick up?

09:26.130 --> 09:27.825
I don't know.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.498
Look, I'm not letting you
put yourself in danger.

09:29.530 --> 09:31.157
It's a computer
repair shop, Caleb

09:31.200 --> 09:33.361
the only danger I'm in
is being bored to death.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.665
I saw you almost get your face
re-heeled at that cobbler shop.

09:36.700 --> 09:41.205
Please, just focus
on helping Spencer.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.730
Okay? I owe it to her.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.600
We owe it to her.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.174
What does that mean?

09:49.780 --> 09:51.270
What does that mean, Hanna?

09:53.220 --> 09:55.586
I don't think that she would
have self-sabotaged that night

09:55.620 --> 09:58.282
if it wasn't for everything
going on with the three of us.

10:00.930 --> 10:03.694
I was there behind the door

10:03.730 --> 10:06.096
when you were begging her
to let you in.

10:06.130 --> 10:07.927
She was a mess.

10:07.970 --> 10:09.392
I promised her
I was over you

10:09.440 --> 10:12.603
I gave her permission
to fall in love with you.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.702
Well, that doesn't mean
that you have to

10:15.740 --> 10:18.231
punish yourself
and do this solo.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.314
The only thing scary
than playing this game

10:23.350 --> 10:25.079
is losing a friend over it.

10:26.950 --> 10:28.759
Thanks again for staying.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.985
No, I'm grateful
for the distraction.

10:31.030 --> 10:33.248
Breaks up my morning
of uninterrupted panic.

10:33.290 --> 10:36.157
- Spence, it's gonna be okay.
- Really?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.724
Because if Furey
doesn't move fast enough

10:37.770 --> 10:39.499
our friends are gonna
tar and feather me.

10:39.530 --> 10:40.827
They're just concerned.

10:41.970 --> 10:43.392
The thing is,
ifI can get him alone

10:43.440 --> 10:44.759
I'm pretty sure
that I can convince him to drop.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.459
Yeah, that is a bad idea.

10:46.510 --> 10:48.831
Why? I know that he still
cares about me.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.405
Okay, don't overestimate
someone's feeling's for you.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.247
Okay? It-it's rislq.

10:55.950 --> 10:58.942
Okay, well, aren't you
taking the same risk?

11:00.050 --> 11:02.314
- With Ali?
- What do you mean?

11:02.360 --> 11:05.181
I mean what is the plan
between you two?

11:05.230 --> 11:07.858
It's not a puppy, Em,
it's a baby.

11:07.900 --> 11:11.154
Okay, Ali is going through
this experience, too.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.395
And I think she wants to be
a part of the baby's life.

11:13.430 --> 11:16.866
- Is that something she said?
- What are you doing?

11:16.900 --> 11:18.265
I know that you guys
have made this decision

11:18.310 --> 11:20.005
but I think
that you're assuming a lot.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.031
Yeah, well,
this is all new territory.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.402
Okay? So stop judging me
or her or any of it.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.815
[dramatic music]

11:36.660 --> 11:38.287
Hey.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.850
Is everything okay?

11:41.760 --> 11:43.796
Jillian is an ass.

11:45.470 --> 11:48.462
She wants me to do
the press tour alone.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.036
Why?

11:51.770 --> 11:53.203
Oh.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.801
I'm not the happy ending
Jillian was hoping for.

11:57.510 --> 11:58.807
I'm not Nicole.

11:58.850 --> 12:01.068
I'm telling her
I'm not doing it.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.910
No, I want you to do it.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.050
Selling this book will help us

12:11.090 --> 12:13.149
build a better future together.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.555
Without you, this book
wouldn't even exist.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.818
But I'm not eager to be
in the spotlight right now.

12:16.860 --> 12:18.327
[sighs]

12:20.540 --> 12:22.599
When I wrote this book

12:22.640 --> 12:23.993
I was giving

12:24.040 --> 12:26.759
a voice to a ghost.

12:26.810 --> 12:29.278
But now, Nicole can speak
for herself

12:29.310 --> 12:32.541
and I_don't feel comfortable
answering questions about her.

12:32.580 --> 12:35.208
It just doesn't feel right
not having you there.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.218
I will be there.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.787
Sitting front row
and cheering you on.

12:39.820 --> 12:42.550
[instrumental music]

12:42.590 --> 12:44.455

(Caleb)
'Why wouldn't A.D. pick up
this hard drive on her own?‘

12:48.930 --> 12:51.592
Because it's probably
a weapon or something.

12:51.630 --> 12:53.063
Hanna, stop pacing.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.965
Well, how do you know
it's not going to explode

12:55.000 --> 12:56.069
once you hook it up?

12:56.100 --> 12:57.135
It's not going to explode.

12:57.170 --> 12:58.569
Well, it was sent from AD.

12:58.610 --> 13:00.669
Alright? It might explode,
it might poison you

13:00.710 --> 13:03.873
and it might poke you
in the eye with a box cutter.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.946
[instrumental music
over speaker]

13:11.920 --> 13:14.286
It might be a code,
or an encrypted message

13:14.320 --> 13:15.548
maybe a virus?

13:15.590 --> 13:17.512
It's a Pasty Cline song.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.925
That much I figured out, Hanna.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.622
No, I mean A played this
in the dollhouse.

13:21.660 --> 13:24.094
Not this song,
but Pasty Cline.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.495
It means something.

13:26.970 --> 13:28.267
Well, can you think
of any connection

13:28.300 --> 13:29.597
that Lucas would have to this?

13:29.640 --> 13:30.959
Lucas is not A.D.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.659
Hanna, I know that
it might be hard to believe.

13:32.710 --> 13:34.735
Caleb, this person saved me.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.099
He gave me
and my friends an alibi

13:36.140 --> 13:37.334
the night
of Charlotte's murder.

13:37.380 --> 13:38.677
It's not Lucas.

13:38.710 --> 13:44.068
See the market place
in Old Algiers..

13:46.020 --> 13:47.840
[knock on door]

14:02.540 --> 14:04.098
Hi, Marco.

14:10.540 --> 14:13.771
The apartment's different
than how I pictured it.

14:13.810 --> 14:15.971
Don't.

14:16.020 --> 14:18.989
Just say what you
came here to say.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.295
Look, I didn't exactly
expect a warm welcome

14:29.330 --> 14:31.218
but it's-it's hard
to talk to you

14:31.270 --> 14:32.999
when you're looking
at me like that.

14:33.030 --> 14:35.123
How am I supposed to look?

14:35.170 --> 14:38.298
I'm the same person that I was
three days ago, Marco.

14:38.340 --> 14:40.160
I'm the same person
that you brought dinner to

14:40.210 --> 14:41.302
and you played ping pong with

14:41.340 --> 14:44.798
and the same person
that you kissed.

14:44.850 --> 14:46.477
Well, that might be true.

14:49.250 --> 14:51.741
But it turns out I didn't know
that person much.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.008
Well, I know you.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.984
I know that you're fair
and decent.

14:57.020 --> 14:59.022
You're involved in a murder.

14:59.860 --> 15:02.078
Look, Dunhill was a monster.

15:02.130 --> 15:03.620
He preyed on people.

15:03.660 --> 15:05.628
Lost, vulnerable people..

15:05.670 --> 15:07.865
People who trusted him.

15:07.900 --> 15:11.563
Why shouldn't he die in the same
disgusting way that he lived?

15:11.610 --> 15:13.566
Because we have something
called the justice system.

15:13.610 --> 15:15.464
Yes, and justice is just
another way for saying

15:15.510 --> 15:17.671
that people should get
what they deserve.

15:17.710 --> 15:20.008
No, it isn't.

15:20.050 --> 15:21.608
Look, I'm not saying
I don't understand

15:21.650 --> 15:23.117
why you would want him dead.

15:23.150 --> 15:26.347
But it's my job to figure out
who broke the law, not why.

15:26.390 --> 15:28.881
Okay, but can't you just
stop being a cop?

15:28.920 --> 15:30.911
Just for a minute. Please.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.849
Can't you just be
a human being?

15:33.890 --> 15:36.358
Okay? I'm not asking you
to help me.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.129
I am not asking you
to lie for me.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.661
I'm just asking you to just..

15:42.340 --> 15:46.299
...just...please let this one
slip through the cracks.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.602
Please, just this once.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.219
You can do that,
can't you?

[instrumental music]

16:09.460 --> 16:11.098
No.

16:12.330 --> 16:15.026

as well as you thought.

have to do with this?‘

16:55.040 --> 16:56.268
I don't know,
I didn't ask.

your name please?‘

Wait, I recognize this.

after Charlotte's murder.

No.

I came back to tell the truth.‘

where Hanna was.

'Why did you lie?'

17:31.810 --> 17:34.278
(Lucas)
'Because she asked
for my help.‘

'And I don't think
that Hanna had'

'anything to do
with Charlotte's death.‘

17:37.750 --> 17:39.411
(Marco)
'What about her friends?‘

17:40.720 --> 17:42.517
I can't vouch for them.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.313
'Now, I've see too many things
that they're capable of.'

17:45.360 --> 17:47.351
(Marco)
'Do you think they did it?'

17:50.030 --> 17:51.622
Let's say that
I wouldn't be surprised.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.820
- Dammit!
- Spencer, calm down.

17:53.870 --> 17:55.098
No, Furey is building a case.

and talks to him?

we're rotting In Jail before'

to prove that he's torturing us.

It's not Lucas.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.576

under the bus.

18:03.610 --> 18:04.929
- I don't care.
- Shall I rewind it

make him sick.

we're pushed hard enough.

you show me

just like every one of you.

you guys looked

you would never hurt me.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.365
That's not true.

18:33.710 --> 18:35.405
You haven't
always known that.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.930
You were once
so afraid of Lucas

18:36.980 --> 18:39.403
you pushed him out
of a row boat.

18:39.450 --> 18:43.113
Maybe there's a way that we can
find out if it's him.

18:43.150 --> 18:44.549
What do you mean?

18:44.590 --> 18:46.444

from AD. to tell her

18:46.490 --> 18:48.242
when to take that hard drive
to the school

18:48.290 --> 18:51.487
we should stake out the locker.

that's what you said.

a million times.‘

It only has to work once.

so let's see

It is, but my mom was away
for the weekend

- Yeah, It was mine.

- Yeah, I'm running late today.

Okay, that's not real food.

Give me five minutes,
I'll make you something.

to take those.

- They're important.
- I know.

And I'll take them.
I just keep forgetting.

in your phone

maybe one for breakfast too.

- Grumpy much?
- No, I'm not grumpy.

already flaking out on me.

19:51.620 --> 19:52.609
What?

Well, you say
you wanna do things

19:53.890 --> 19:55.118
and you end up bailing.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.354
Get a grip,
they're just vitamins.

19:56.390 --> 19:57.755
It's not about
the vitamins, okay?

I'm looking down the road
and what I see is

and runnin' off to Paris.

would come with

they'd be yours.

[sighs]

20:22.920 --> 20:25.309
[sighs]
It's the text from AD.
that was sent this morning.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.511
(Caleb)
'Hanna has to drop off
the hard drive at the school'

20:27.550 --> 20:30.849
at the exact same time the staff
meeting starts at the Radley.

20:30.890 --> 20:33.859
Great, so basically Hanna has
to be in two places at once.

20:33.890 --> 20:35.755
It just means that we're working
in a tight time frame.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.495
Okay, so Caleb will disable
the cameras

20:37.530 --> 20:39.020
and, Hanna, you'll grab
the credit card slip.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.594
Yeah, but I only have
ten minutes to do it

20:40.630 --> 20:41.767
or the SWAT team shows up.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.336
(Caleb)
'It's enough time.‘

20:43.370 --> 20:45.099
The boxes are all marked.
It shouldn't be hard.

20:45.140 --> 20:46.368
Well, I'm glad you're confident.

20:46.410 --> 20:47.934
Listen, I know we're
a little short on people

20:47.980 --> 20:51.677
but I promised Ezra I'd go
to this press event tonight.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.974
Fine, just go. All and I
will wait at the school

20:54.010 --> 20:56.342
'to see who picks up
the hard drive.‘

21:03.260 --> 21:04.818
Is everything okay?

21:04.860 --> 21:08.182
Rosewood PD wants to_ schedule
my second InterVIew.

21:08.230 --> 21:10.755
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.267
Isn't it?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.538
[instrumental music]

21:17.570 --> 21:20.038
You weren't drinking
at that bar to celebrate.

21:22.180 --> 21:23.932
I'm gonna go get some rest.

21:23.980 --> 21:25.641
Wait, Spencer.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.041
Hanna and I aren't gonna
let you down this time.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.616
I promise.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.947
I hope that
that still means something.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.452
It does.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.473
Sorry. Didn't mean
to scare you.

21:56.510 --> 21:58.330
Where're you going?

21:58.380 --> 22:00.507
Oh, um, I'm going
to meet the girls.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.438
Don't bother,
it's like watching a frog

22:02.480 --> 22:04.744
trying to jump out
of a pot of boiling water.

22:04.790 --> 22:07.008
- Why are you shutting me out?
- I'm not.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.453
You showed me the game
for a reason.

22:10.490 --> 22:11.957
I'm ready to play

22:11.990 --> 22:14.925
but I can't help you
if I'm kept in the dark.

22:17.830 --> 22:20.424
AD. is going to pick this up
from the school tonight.

22:20.470 --> 22:22.097
It's the best chance
we've had in a long time

22:22.140 --> 22:23.596
to expose this person.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.335
So, let me be
another set of eyes.

22:25.370 --> 22:26.860
Mona, you know
that I want that

22:26.910 --> 22:29.970
but the others can't find out
that you're involved.

22:32.550 --> 22:35.348
You didn't tell them
that I know about the game.

22:36.950 --> 22:38.713
I couldn't.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.615
They still don't trust me?

22:42.020 --> 22:44.853
Fine, I'll help you and your
friends like I always do

22:44.890 --> 22:46.551
and then crawl back
under a rock.

22:46.590 --> 22:48.649
Mona, come on,
it's not like that.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.658
I have literally bled myself
for you, Hanna.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.395
Trying to protect you.

22:53.430 --> 22:55.295
How many times do I have
to save all of you

22:55.340 --> 22:57.638
until I'm finally part
of the group?

23:01.070 --> 23:03.630
Well, you might as well head
over to the high school.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.807
Seems like we never left.

23:12.290 --> 23:14.611
[indistinct chatter]

23:15.620 --> 23:17.315
Hey, thank you
for coming.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.759
Thank you for coming.

23:18.790 --> 23:21.486
Ezra, we really
have to get started.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.054
Yeah, okay.

24:25.760 --> 24:29.059
Look, Ali, I'm sorry
about earlier.

24:31.430 --> 24:33.091
[sighs]

24:33.130 --> 24:35.621
I'm just scared
I won't be able to do this.

24:38.470 --> 24:40.267
So am I.

24:40.310 --> 24:43.234
But mostly because I feel
like you're testing me.

24:45.150 --> 24:48.278
I don't know
what the tests are, but..

24:48.320 --> 24:50.140
...I know that I'm failing.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.272

This way!

[Alison screams]

24:59.990 --> 25:01.582
Ali.

25:06.270 --> 25:08.226
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I think so.

25:08.270 --> 25:10.135
- What happened?
- Someone knocked me down.

25:10.170 --> 25:11.967
They flew past me so fast
I didn't get to see who it was.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.261
I'm gonna get you home, okay?

25:13.310 --> 25:14.709
- But what about the--
- No, forget it.

25:14.740 --> 25:16.435
They're probably
long gone anyway.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.301
Okay. Come on.

25:19.350 --> 25:20.442
It's gonna be okay.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.971
[dramatic music]

'Hey, mom..'

25:39.700 --> 25:43.261
'I'm fine. Really.
It wasn't bad a fall.‘

26:48.740 --> 26:50.799
[music intensifies]

26:55.880 --> 26:57.632
It was an, an exorcism
of-of sorts

26:57.680 --> 26:58.931
writing the book.

26:58.980 --> 27:00.868
'I had to confront
a lot of demons.‘

27:00.910 --> 27:04.812
But, thankfully, I didn't
have to do it on my own.

27:04.850 --> 27:06.943
Uh, any questions or..

27:06.990 --> 27:08.548
Uh, yes, lady in red.

27:08.590 --> 27:10.148
Hi. I'm just curious.

27:10.190 --> 27:11.987
Is there another book
in the works?

27:12.030 --> 27:14.988
Are we gonna get to continue
your journey with Nicole?

27:17.300 --> 27:19.256
[instrumental music]

27:21.000 --> 27:22.627
No, I'm afraid not.

27:22.670 --> 27:25.059
'I am about to start
another Journey'

27:25.110 --> 27:28.534
I am getting married
to Aria Montgomery

27:28.580 --> 27:32.676
my co-author, and this story
may be about Nicole

27:32.710 --> 27:35.372
but my inspiration
in work, in life

27:35.420 --> 27:39.789
and in every sense
of the word, is Aria.

27:39.820 --> 27:41.708
(Alison)
'What a monster.‘

27:41.760 --> 27:43.284
I know that Lucas
destroyed your memorial

27:43.320 --> 27:46.255
but do we really think
he's as disgusting as all this?

27:46.290 --> 27:49.020
I could kick myself.
I was so close to catching him.

27:49.060 --> 27:51.119
(Spencer)
'I'm just glad
he didn't hurt you guys.‘

27:51.160 --> 27:53.196
He clearly didn't expect you
to be home.

27:53.230 --> 27:56.097
Exactly. He knew
we were at the school.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.665
I think the hard drive thing
was a setup.

27:59.910 --> 28:02.105
Did-did you catch
a glimpse of him?

28:02.140 --> 28:04.700
No, if Lucas is A.D.,
he definitely has a helper.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.229
(Spencer)
'What do you mean?‘

28:06.280 --> 28:07.804
There's no way whoever's
at that school

28:07.850 --> 28:09.647
could beat us back here.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.671

Em, it's gonna be okay.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.809
- 'We-we can fix it.'
- Here.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.979
Look, we can glue
this back together, see?

28:40.110 --> 28:41.998
(Ali)
'Em, don't let this scare you.‘

28:42.050 --> 28:44.245
'When you do that,
you give A.D. power.‘

28:44.280 --> 28:45.918
(Emily)
'Of course I'm scared.‘

28:45.950 --> 28:47.212
'I mean, this is supposed
to be the baby's room'

28:47.250 --> 28:48.979
'and now I know
we'll never be safe.‘

28:49.020 --> 28:50.908
Aria, is this yours?

28:50.960 --> 28:52.882
[music continues]

28:52.930 --> 28:54.488
Oh, yeah.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.919
It's funny I thought
I heard something

28:57.960 --> 29:00.861
drop on the floor
when I came in.

29:00.900 --> 29:03.539
- Thank you.
- I can't be in here anymore.

29:03.570 --> 29:05.037
Come on, let's go.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.853
[music continues]

29:26.460 --> 29:28.428
- Hanna, what is taking so long?
- I can't find it.

29:28.460 --> 29:30.121
I can't find it anywhere.
You have to help me.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.229
What? I thought
the boxes were marked.

29:31.260 --> 29:33.125
They are,
but it wasn't in there.

29:33.170 --> 29:35.320
- Hanna, we have to go.
- No. Not until I find it.

29:35.370 --> 29:37.429
If I don't turn this system
back on, we're going to jail.

29:37.470 --> 29:39.961
Caleb, I'm not letting Spencer
go down for something I did.

29:40.010 --> 29:42.706
We have to find that credit card
slip, we promised her.

29:42.740 --> 29:45.300
[music continues]

29:53.190 --> 29:55.818
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

29:55.860 --> 29:57.316
- Getting rid of the evidence.
- 'No.'

29:57.360 --> 29:59.157
'An entire police force
is going to come in here'

29:59.190 --> 30:01.385
and pick through that. They're
gonna find it eventually.

30:06.970 --> 30:09.495
There'll be
nothing left to find.

30:09.540 --> 30:11.667
Let's go.

30:11.710 --> 30:14.838
[instrumental music]

30:17.140 --> 30:18.402
Okay, can you hurry up?

30:18.450 --> 30:19.849
My stomach has done
so many backflips

30:19.880 --> 30:20.972
I can join the Olympic team.

30:21.010 --> 30:22.443
Give me a second.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.619
[Hanna sighing]

30:24.650 --> 30:26.982
Okay, I have to run downstairs
and reboot the security system.

30:27.020 --> 30:29.853
- Are you okay on your own?
- Yeah, go.

I'm still at the school. Alone.‘

'Your gal pals mistook me
for Uber A'

'chased me
and then just took off.‘

away, because no one'

to get this thing.‘

'You took something from me,
and if I don't get it back.‘

'I'm sending an officer
to your door.‘

31:42.630 --> 31:43.949
I'm sorry, I can't help you

if I don't know what
you're talking about.

'You think this is a game?‘

'Stop jerking me around
and give me the damn drive.‘

31:54.210 --> 31:56.508
If I had that thumb drive

31:56.540 --> 31:59.008
that would mean
that I was In your apartment

31:59.050 --> 32:01.678
alone with you that night.

32:03.220 --> 32:05.575
I wonder if people would think
that was strange.

It's over Lucas.
We know It was you.

32:42.660 --> 32:45.458
[instrumental music]

32:47.430 --> 32:48.988
Look, I can explain
why I'm here.

32:49.030 --> 32:50.395
Did it feel good to scare us?

32:50.430 --> 32:52.057
- Did it make you feel powerful?
- What?

32:52.100 --> 32:54.261
You smeared blood on a crib.

32:57.570 --> 32:59.629
- Maybe he didn't.
- Are you crazy?

32:59.670 --> 33:01.604
If he isn't A.D.
then why is he here?

33:01.640 --> 33:05.406
- I'm not staying.
- Lucas, at least tell me why.

33:05.450 --> 33:08.305
I saw the police tape.
I know you took it back.

33:08.350 --> 33:11.410
Being our alibi
after Charlotte was murdered.

33:11.450 --> 33:13.611
- You saw that?
- It didn't work the first time.

33:13.650 --> 33:15.083
So now you're sending
body parts.

33:16.460 --> 33:19.020
If you don't know,
why are you so freaked out?

33:19.060 --> 33:20.948
Because of the book.

33:20.990 --> 33:22.981
Because of my friendship
with Charles.

33:23.030 --> 33:25.089
I figured he found out.

33:25.130 --> 33:28.361
But I swear, I swear
that I didn't know that he..

33:28.400 --> 33:30.766
She
was the one
who was torturing you.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.268
I didn't think that he and
Charlotte were the same person.

33:33.310 --> 33:34.766
You just said
that you stayed friends.

33:34.810 --> 33:36.266
Over e—mail.

33:36.310 --> 33:37.709
If you didn't know
that you were friends with A

33:37.740 --> 33:38.729
then why would you lie about it

33:38.780 --> 33:40.042
after you found out.

33:42.550 --> 33:45.110
Lucas, speak!

33:45.150 --> 33:46.378
Because it may be
a part of the reason

33:46.420 --> 33:48.217
why you were tortured.

33:48.250 --> 33:49.740
[instrumental music]

33:49.790 --> 33:51.883
Most of the e-mails
that I sent in high school

33:51.930 --> 33:54.057
were about mean queen Alison.

33:54.090 --> 33:56.285
And her loyal band of followers.

33:57.900 --> 34:01.461
I gave details about how
you made my life a living hell.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.468
And how the rest of you
just watched.

34:04.900 --> 34:06.959
So that's why you stole back
the comic book.

34:07.010 --> 34:10.036
It's a graphic novel
and I didn't.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.674
It was sent to me,
along with this.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.176
"Want to keep
your friendship a secret?

34:18.220 --> 34:19.244
Meet me at the Radley."

34:19.290 --> 34:21.042
I went but nobody showed up.

34:21.090 --> 34:23.581
Why'd you come back here
if you already had the book?

34:25.130 --> 34:27.428
Because there's a second book.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.826
One that was done much later.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.090
It turned the idea of vengeance
into a game.

34:32.130 --> 34:34.496
A game?

34:34.530 --> 34:36.168
But I came back tonight
because I didn't want

34:36.200 --> 34:38.065
whoever sent that note
to have it.

34:38.100 --> 34:40.739
Where is it?
Where is the other book?

34:41.740 --> 34:43.276
I was too late.

34:44.140 --> 34:45.698
How did the book end?

34:47.210 --> 34:48.507
I don't know.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.519
It was never finished.

34:58.220 --> 35:00.586
[instrumental music]

35:03.830 --> 35:05.627
Thanks for that.

35:09.770 --> 35:11.567
[door opens]

35:11.600 --> 35:13.306
Lucas?

35:15.780 --> 35:17.577
I believe you.

35:20.580 --> 35:23.743
That you weren't part
of what happened to us.

35:25.850 --> 35:27.886
But why is the factory for sale?

35:29.420 --> 35:32.389
_ And was our
busmess partnership ever real?

35:33.730 --> 35:36.426
I think you're
so talented, Hanna.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.496
I just..

35:40.530 --> 35:41.997
I had trouble
getting other people

35:42.040 --> 35:44.167
to take a chance on you.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.232
Well, what about the investors?

35:50.110 --> 35:52.237
You're lookin' at him.

35:53.710 --> 35:55.246
I was too embarrassed
to tell you

35:55.280 --> 35:56.918
that I couldn't do it anymore.

35:56.950 --> 36:01.649
So my friends made your life
miserable in high school.

36:01.690 --> 36:03.442
They almost broke
your collarbone tonight

36:03.490 --> 36:06.186
and now you're telling me
that...I lost all your money.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.357
I'll make it back again.

36:09.530 --> 36:13.091
Besides...it was worth it.

36:13.130 --> 36:16.019
How was it worth it?

36:16.070 --> 36:18.197
What's worth losing everything?

36:20.140 --> 36:21.607
You.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.672
Thank you.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.809
I never doubted that you were—-

36:30.850 --> 36:32.511
I know.

36:34.750 --> 36:36.286
I know.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.209
[instrumental music]

36:52.670 --> 36:54.535
This is gonna be
a very short interview.

36:54.570 --> 36:56.629
Then why couldn't it wait?

36:56.680 --> 36:58.636
Earlier tonight
the Radley Bar was flooded.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.944
Destroying all the receipts
stored there.

37:00.980 --> 37:03.175
And we know that the flooding
was deliberate.

37:03.220 --> 37:04.471
But security cams went dark

37:04.520 --> 37:06.476
during the exact
ten minutes we need.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.317
That must make your job
very difficult.

37:08.350 --> 37:09.817
Almost impossible.

37:10.890 --> 37:13.154
Almost.

37:13.190 --> 37:16.250
We'll just have to broaden
the scope of my investigation.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.689
- Of a flood?
- Of a homicide.

37:18.730 --> 37:21.096
Let's hope your friends
are as lucky as you are.

37:21.130 --> 37:23.963
[instrumental music]

37:30.580 --> 37:32.901
You were a crazy person tonight.

37:32.950 --> 37:33.939
Me?

37:33.980 --> 37:34.969
I was scared you were gonna

37:35.010 --> 37:36.079
tear Lucas' head off.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.712
I thought he was A.D.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.149
Besides,
you were the one that used

37:39.190 --> 37:41.283
a Pottery Barn candlestick
as a deadly weapon.

37:41.320 --> 37:42.685
[chuckles]

37:44.320 --> 37:47.380
I don't know why I thought
I had to protect you.

37:47.430 --> 37:49.955
You're basically the strongest
woman I know.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.697
Then I'll let you go

37:53.730 --> 37:55.197
You've always protected me, Em.

37:55.230 --> 37:57.539
Hard for you

37:57.570 --> 37:59.731
Ever since I met you,
I knew I could count on you.

38:02.310 --> 38:04.778
So why did you
always push me away?

38:06.980 --> 38:09.949
I'm broken

38:09.980 --> 38:12.813
Don't break me

38:13.850 --> 38:16.148
When I hit the ground

38:16.190 --> 38:18.556
I don't know.

38:18.590 --> 38:21.923
Some devil

38:21.960 --> 38:23.655
But I'm ready to stop.

38:25.500 --> 38:29.459
Has got me to the bones

38:30.540 --> 38:31.768
You said

38:31.800 --> 38:35.566
I wanna do this...together.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.333
What do you mean, together?

38:38.380 --> 38:41.099
Now I believe you baby

38:41.150 --> 38:42.469
I wanna be a family.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.148
You said

38:45.180 --> 38:47.080
Alison,
I need to be clear about--

38:47.120 --> 38:50.954
Over the years, I've been
in so many failed relationships.

38:51.860 --> 38:53.987
And I always made excuses why.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.889
But I know the reason.

38:58.930 --> 39:01.398
[instrumental music]

39:04.240 --> 39:05.798
Paige tried to get me to say it

39:05.840 --> 39:08.308
but I didn't wanna say it
to her.

39:08.340 --> 39:09.967
- What did Paige—-
- I love you.

39:10.010 --> 39:13.673
Still drinking

39:13.710 --> 39:17.771
It's just the way I feel..

39:17.820 --> 39:21.881
You told me not to do this
until I was ready.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.717
Do what?

39:25.730 --> 39:30.281
'Cause what we had
was so beautiful

39:30.330 --> 39:31.399
This.

39:31.430 --> 39:34.319
Feelheavy

39:34.370 --> 39:37.635
Like floating

39:37.670 --> 39:43.006
At the bottom of the sea

39:44.710 --> 39:49.477
Always and forever

39:50.680 --> 39:54.719
Now I believe you baby

39:54.750 --> 39:59.517
You said always

39:59.560 --> 40:02.484
And forever

40:02.530 --> 40:04.555
Is such a long

40:04.600 --> 40:07.967
And lonely time

And forever

You said

40:32.730 --> 40:37.190
Always and forever

40:39.000 --> 40:44.063
Such a long and lonely time
