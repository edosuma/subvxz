00:13.221 --> 00:14.264
<i>Closer.</i>

00:15.598 --> 00:17.600
<i>Oh, too close. Back it up.</i>

00:18.893 --> 00:20.729
<i>Aquarius, huh? Funny.</i>

00:20.979 --> 00:22.981
<i>You don't look nearly mysterious enough.</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:25.358
<i>Wait there.</i>

00:34.743 --> 00:36.023
I don't know what I can tell you

00:36.077 --> 00:38.204
that I didn't already tell
Head-Up-His-Ass Harkness

00:38.288 --> 00:40.582
a million times, but come on in.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.594
Strangest case I've ever had,
no doubt.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.679
No signs of forced entry.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.556
Doors and windows were locked.

00:56.848 --> 01:00.310
No DNA. Not a single neighbor
saw or heard a thing.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.145
And then there's the victim.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.784
<i>Imagine you're in an elevator.</i>

01:04.813 --> 01:06.232
<i>You're going down, down...</i>

01:06.316 --> 01:09.152
<i>No, I'm in a meadow.
I'm walking through a meadow.</i>

01:09.986 --> 01:11.446
<i>Okay, a meadow.</i>

01:12.030 --> 01:13.990
She insisted on a hypnosis session.

01:14.949 --> 01:17.577
<i>And I'm going to act as a medium
during the session.</i>

01:17.660 --> 01:19.472
<i>You wanna channel
other voices while...</i>

01:19.496 --> 01:22.749
One day, she calls up to say
that since the attack,

01:22.832 --> 01:26.086
her cat had been scratching people
wearing black boots.

01:26.377 --> 01:29.756
- <i>The moon is bright.</i>
- She thought this was an important lead.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.943
- <i>Throwing my long...</i>
- She also wanted me to canvass local gyms

01:32.967 --> 01:36.221
for a well-built, six-foot white man
with blue eyes.

01:36.513 --> 01:41.267
<i>The bad man stands above my roots,
watching her through my branches.</i>

01:41.851 --> 01:46.022
Tell you the truth, I might have written
her off entirely if not for her injuries.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.109
Those were very, very real.

01:52.320 --> 01:57.367
I was sound asleep in here, and I woke
to the sound of a strange scuffling.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.162
<i>Jerome! Jerome, help me!</i>

02:01.454 --> 02:02.956
<i>So, Jerome was here?</i>

02:03.289 --> 02:05.583
No. He was at home in Canada.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.086
Jerome can hear me from anywhere.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.422
I called to him, and he answered
by distracting my attacker.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.841
I owe him my life.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.718
Well, you can give yourself
a little credit too.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.513
It takes a lot of guts
jumping off a balcony like that.

02:18.763 --> 02:19.931
I had no choice.

02:27.856 --> 02:31.776
I couldn't move.
I thought I'd severed my spine.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.864
Eventually, somehow, I got up.

02:36.447 --> 02:39.909
I cracked my pelvis, punctured my lung,
shattered my femur.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.953
Couldn't work for months.

02:42.036 --> 02:45.582
The medical bills would floor you.
Physical therapy alone is up to 12 grand.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.959
Not to mention my poor mother
who's worried herself sick.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.627
And you cannot begin to imagine

02:49.961 --> 02:52.672
what it took to get my neighbors
to pitch in for an armed patrol.

02:52.755 --> 02:56.009
It was like asking for their firstborn
instead of thirty-five bucks a month.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.178
But, hey, I get it.

02:58.636 --> 02:59.637
Public safety.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.432
Isn't that what our tax dollars are for?

03:17.280 --> 03:18.573
<i>So, tell me this.</i>

03:18.823 --> 03:22.160
Why would a police department sweep
something as awful as this under the rug?

03:22.243 --> 03:23.923
Because that's what's this is. A cover-up.

03:24.078 --> 03:27.582
Ms. Darrow, cases like this,
that have very limited evidence...

03:27.665 --> 03:28.833
I'll tell you why.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.336
They'd do it if my attacker
was one of them.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.219
What makes you think your assailant
was a police officer?

03:40.887 --> 03:43.306
One night, a few weeks after my attack,

03:44.098 --> 03:46.267
<i>I heard a noise down here.</i>

03:47.560 --> 03:49.270
<i>I called 911.</i>

03:50.021 --> 03:51.439
They sent an officer.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.985
<i>I was about let him in
when he lifted his flashlight</i>

03:56.653 --> 03:59.364
exactly the way that my attacker
held his knife.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.351
So, I screamed at him to go away.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.077
I wasn't gonna give that sicko
another chance to finish the job.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.746
And did you share this concern
with Detective Harkness?

04:08.248 --> 04:11.542
This, uh, patrol incident...

04:11.626 --> 04:13.419
Oh, yeah, God.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.923
She was sure it was him.
One hundred percent convinced.

04:17.589 --> 04:18.632
And?

04:19.050 --> 04:20.385
The night of the attack,

04:20.468 --> 04:24.013
Officer Fagan was in Cabo
with his fiancÃ©e.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.767
And I offered to show her his passport,
but, uh, by then,

04:28.226 --> 04:29.435
I was just the enemy,

04:29.936 --> 04:32.647
and she was convinced
I'd do anything to cover for him.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.983
So, a real breakdown in trust.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.901
Yeah, that's partly my fault.

04:37.193 --> 04:41.239
I think it all started when I, uh,
questioned her about the kava kava.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.907
Did you have anything to drink?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.534
I don't drink.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.499
Uh, how about drugs?
Uh, marijuana, sleeping pills?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.127
I had a salad for dinner

04:54.502 --> 04:57.630
and my usual cup of kava kava before bed.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.632
And that's it.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.012
It's a natural muscle relaxant?

05:04.095 --> 05:07.432
Yeah, it's some root that they grow
in the Pacific Islands,

05:07.515 --> 05:09.851
and you make tea out of it.

05:09.934 --> 05:15.565
And it hits you kinda like a Valium
or a stiff martini.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.609
But in high doses,
it can cause hallucinations.

05:19.110 --> 05:23.156
So, I asked her, is there any chance
that you kinda overdid it with the tea

05:23.239 --> 05:26.034
and this whole thing
is just a really vivid dream?

05:26.367 --> 05:28.244
Uh, I know.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.081
No victim likes to be asked
if she imagined her assault.

05:32.665 --> 05:33.791
But I had to.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.879
I mean, maybe if I'd seen the report
on the physical evidence by then,

05:37.962 --> 05:39.130
I wouldn't have.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.591
But my guy was late in writing it up,

05:41.674 --> 05:45.011
and at that time, I didn't know
that we had shoe and glove prints.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.264
You have shoe and glove prints?

05:49.682 --> 05:52.769
Here, Detective Harkness
wouldn't pay for a sketch artist.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.021
He said since the guy was masked,
there was no point.

05:55.104 --> 05:57.398
So, I had a friend do one,
a Brazilian lithographer.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.816
Very famous in Rio.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.486
His work sells for thousands,
but he did this for free.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.114
I'll check it out. Thank you.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.327
Nothing is unknowable, Detective.

06:09.911 --> 06:13.206
All of the information needed to catch
that guy is out there.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.000
You just have to know how to ask.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.597
If a case looks at all like one of ours,

06:29.680 --> 06:32.058
call the detective listed
and ask for the file.

06:32.642 --> 06:36.062
Print it out and stick it
in one of these red babies.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.732
ViCap is labor-intensive
and time-consuming,

06:39.816 --> 06:42.443
and God, I love having an intern.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.367
Okay, so these are the shoe prints

06:49.450 --> 06:52.161
the Lakewood PD found
at Lilly Darrow's house,

06:52.245 --> 06:56.374
and this is from the mud
outside Amber's apartment.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.376
Would you look at that.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.878
Mm-hmm. And even more exciting,

07:01.629 --> 07:04.882
remember this honeycomb pattern
from the Westminster screen door?

07:05.216 --> 07:08.636
Well, this is from a window
at the Darrow house.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.721
- Same guy.
- Yeah.

07:11.722 --> 07:14.350
We may not know his name yet
or what he looks like,

07:14.434 --> 07:15.685
but give me 24 hours,

07:15.768 --> 07:18.646
I'll be able to tell you what shoes
and gloves he owns.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.192
We're startin' to get an outline of him.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.736
Mm, can't put an outline in custody.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.782
You ever hear of sacred geometry?

07:31.409 --> 07:32.785
It's the belief that

07:33.744 --> 07:36.831
things like a honeycomb or a snowflake,

07:37.790 --> 07:39.959
those perfect shapes found in nature,

07:40.751 --> 07:43.379
are proof of organization
by a higher power.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.758
That's not a honeycomb. It's just a glove

07:48.259 --> 07:50.678
made by a greedy American corporation.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.599
Which is definitely a higher power,
but probably not the kind you mean.

08:03.691 --> 08:04.691
What's that?

08:05.234 --> 08:07.945
Lilly Darrow had a sketch drawn up
of her attacker.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.033
You've been sitting on a visual
of the guy?

08:12.450 --> 08:14.076
You're only just telling me now?

08:16.746 --> 08:19.457
Hey, I know you're not used
to working with a partner,

08:19.540 --> 08:24.086
and maybe you think I was forced on you,
but I am here.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.422
I am your partner in all this.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.550
And in case you've lost the thread,
there's a bad dude out there,

08:29.634 --> 08:32.428
right now, threatening women, right now.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.272
If we're gonna stop him
before he hits again,

08:34.347 --> 08:35.707
you have to start working with me.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.164
And that means giving me
at least a little of the information

08:38.226 --> 08:42.730
and a little of the respect that
I've definitely, after six years as...

08:46.859 --> 08:47.859
Ah.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.277
Yeah.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.198
Not a lot of information there.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.032
Nope.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.243
Right.

08:57.286 --> 08:58.287
Sorry.

08:58.871 --> 08:59.871
No sweat.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.750
You're not the first person
who finds me disagreeable.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.377
That's not what I said.

09:08.673 --> 09:09.966
Listen, uh...

09:11.676 --> 09:14.554
I know I'm not exactly
a constant ray of sunshine,

09:14.971 --> 09:17.306
but you can't take it personally.
It's just me.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.310
There are lots of good cops who celebrate
every little step in the right direction.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.687
I'm just not one of them.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.249
I don't get jazzed about little things.
The sneaker, the glove.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.650
They're positives. Yeah, helpful...

09:28.401 --> 09:29.485
but they're also nothing.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.281
There's only one thing
that I get excited about:

09:34.240 --> 09:35.700
catching the guy.

09:37.201 --> 09:38.828
And we haven't done that yet.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.415
Hey, what's up?

10:34.008 --> 10:35.008
Marie.

10:35.551 --> 10:36.552
Got a sec?

10:42.391 --> 10:46.729
So, unfortunately, everyone here
has read the stories about your situation.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.189
Your picture's everywhere.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.485
I really don't need
to hear anything more about it.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.321
I was just going to say I'm sorry.

10:57.406 --> 11:00.785
Anyway, with all this happening,
I can't have you out on the floor.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.828
So, I'm gonna move you
to the loading docks.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.622
In a month or two, we'll reassess.

11:06.999 --> 11:07.999
Okay.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.170
Nathan's back there.
He'll walk you through your new position.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.051
Okay then, off you go.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.368
<i>...broke in
while the victim was sleeping,</i>

11:24.392 --> 11:26.811
<i>tied her up, and took photos of her.</i>

11:26.894 --> 11:29.939
<i>Sources say he terrorized the victim
for several hours.</i>

11:30.356 --> 11:31.357
Crazy, right?

11:31.899 --> 11:34.402
I couldn't believe it when I saw it.
The similarities.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.319
You think?

11:35.403 --> 11:36.403
I think?

11:36.904 --> 11:39.073
A mask, a knife, the pictures?

11:39.156 --> 11:41.325
Yeah, but, I mean,
how unique are those things?

11:41.409 --> 11:43.828
Don't most attackers wear a mask
and carry a weapon?

11:43.911 --> 11:47.581
- Yeah.
- Plus, Marie says it never happened.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.959
Yeah, but what if it actually did?

11:50.292 --> 11:52.378
And this is the same guy
and they find him?

11:52.628 --> 11:55.881
You know, maybe all this gets cleared up
and all that court stuff goes away.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.800
What court stuff?

11:58.050 --> 11:59.051
She didn't tell you?

11:59.802 --> 12:01.011
Oh, my God.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.307
The police are charging her
with false reporting.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.474
- I mean, she could go to jail.
- Oh, my God.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.643
Well, she got a lawyer. I don't know how.

12:07.810 --> 12:11.021
But, evidently, he's pretty confident
that he can get her a deal.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.401
When I saw this report,
I... I thought, well...

12:17.361 --> 12:19.321
"What if she was telling the truth?"

12:19.405 --> 12:20.406
Hang on.

12:21.198 --> 12:24.618
I just wanna remind you
that when you saw her that first day,

12:24.702 --> 12:26.495
- your first reaction...
- I know.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.791
...was that there was something off,
and I mean, you know.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.919
You've been through it, we both have.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.629
We know how it feels.

12:35.963 --> 12:39.383
Yeah, but what if this is just her
reacting differently

12:39.467 --> 12:40.926
because she's a different person?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.010
Okay.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.180
- What then?
- Well...

12:44.263 --> 12:45.931
then we go to the Kirkland Police,

12:46.015 --> 12:48.702
and we tell 'em the guy that they're
looking for has done this before.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.561
So, they can bring her in for questioning,

12:50.644 --> 12:53.689
and that went so well for her
the first time.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.193
Here's what I ask myself.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.655
What do I want for Marie long-term?

13:02.656 --> 13:06.285
Security, stability, success.

13:06.577 --> 13:07.411
Me too.

13:07.495 --> 13:11.081
So, sticking her in the middle
of someone else's tragedy,

13:11.165 --> 13:13.417
does that get her closer to that goal?

13:13.501 --> 13:17.046
Or does it just backslide her
into the same bureaucratic mess

13:17.129 --> 13:19.048
her life has been all along?

13:23.093 --> 13:26.764
If this lawyer really can make this
all go away...

13:28.432 --> 13:29.809
that's her best bet.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.128
- Baskerville.
<i>- I have a woman on the line</i>

13:58.212 --> 14:00.881
<i>asking for the detective in charge
of the rape that's on the news.</i>

14:01.215 --> 14:02.215
Put her through.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.718
<i>Go ahead, ma'am, you're connected.</i>

14:06.720 --> 14:09.640
Uh, hi. Um, my name is Colleen Doggett.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.101
<i>I saw the news report</i>

14:12.184 --> 14:14.645
<i>about the elderly woman
who was raped in Kirkland.</i>

14:15.980 --> 14:17.857
There's a girl in Lynnwood who has a story

14:17.940 --> 14:19.900
that sounds a lot like
what you're looking at.

14:35.332 --> 14:40.129
<i>âª In Christ alone
My hope is found âª</i>

14:40.421 --> 14:45.342
<i>âª He is my light, my strength, my song âª</i>

14:45.426 --> 14:50.347
<i>âª This cornerstone
This solid ground âª</i>

14:51.098 --> 14:55.811
<i>âª Firm through the fiercest drought
And storm âª</i>

14:55.895 --> 15:00.816
<i>âª What heights of love
What depths of peace âª</i>

15:01.859 --> 15:04.653
Hey, come on. Get back here.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.822
<i>âª When strivings cease âª</i>

15:06.906 --> 15:09.366
<i>âª My comforter âª</i>

15:09.450 --> 15:11.869
<i>âª My all in all âª</i>

15:12.202 --> 15:16.999
<i>âª Here in the love of Christ I stand âª</i>

15:25.841 --> 15:26.884
Aw, hell.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.441
Hey. Hey, guys.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.322
How was the hike?

15:48.781 --> 15:49.781
Grim.

15:52.576 --> 15:56.497
Thank you for indulging me
by going back to that first verse again.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.708
A perfect way to end our morning
spent contemplating

15:59.792 --> 16:04.630
the difference between God's will
for our lives and simply God's will.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.425
It's one thing to pray,
"God, come bless what I'm doing,"

16:08.509 --> 16:13.305
and another to pray, "God, help me
to do what you want to bless."

16:14.014 --> 16:17.101
If we ask anything according to His will,

16:17.559 --> 16:18.559
He hears us.

16:18.769 --> 16:23.232
He's always working out his purpose
in, around, and through us.

16:24.358 --> 16:28.946
So, let's go out in joy
to love and serve the Lord.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.155
Amen.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.448
Amen.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.801
Amber?

16:52.344 --> 16:53.429
Detective.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.681
What are you doing here?

16:55.764 --> 16:57.057
I'm always here.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.143
How about you?

16:59.601 --> 17:01.103
I know you're not a regular.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.022
Uh, no.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.900
No, I, um, I grew up
going to Saint James in Chicago,

17:06.983 --> 17:09.737
but I haven't been to a service
since I moved out here.

17:12.321 --> 17:13.321
I just...

17:14.366 --> 17:15.242
thought...

17:15.325 --> 17:16.952
Feeling a little out of sorts?

17:19.121 --> 17:20.681
Yeah, I'd have said I'm losing my mind,

17:20.705 --> 17:23.459
but "a little out of sorts"
sounds much more dignified.

17:28.881 --> 17:29.881
I bought a gun.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.344
I give my dad hell
about hunting wild turkeys,

17:34.428 --> 17:36.180
and here I am at a shooting range.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.725
I met a guy there.

17:42.519 --> 17:43.979
Two, actually.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.028
I have no idea
why I slept with either one of them.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.448
I didn't plan on it. I just...

17:57.826 --> 17:59.787
If Eric found out...

18:01.997 --> 18:05.459
If anyone found out,
my friends, my family...

18:07.586 --> 18:12.132
Sorry, um, you came here to worship,
not to hear how crazy I've turned.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.802
You don't sound crazy to me.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.680
You sound like someone
who's been through a trauma

18:19.431 --> 18:22.726
and is looking for a way
to feel safe again and in control.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.978
And there is nothing crazy about that.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.732
There are support groups, you know?

18:28.816 --> 18:31.110
No, I don't...
I don't want a support group.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.089
They're full of people who can relate
to everything you've been through.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.614
I just said I don't want that.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.741
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.454
I'm glad you're here.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.561
<i>Yeah, this is
Detective Parker, Lynnwood PD,</i>

18:48.585 --> 18:50.671
<i>giving you a call back about Marie Adler?</i>

18:51.130 --> 18:54.508
Yes, sir, thanks for the return.
I apologize for hounding you.

18:54.591 --> 18:57.970
It always takes me a minute
to get to my calls.

18:58.053 --> 19:01.056
We got about half the manpower
you guys have over there in Kirkland.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.643
Well, I'm hoping
this will be helpful for both of us.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.645
I've got a pretty brutal 2-0 on my hands,

19:06.728 --> 19:09.815
and a tip's come in that you may have
something like it in the Adler case.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.275
What can you tell me about it?

19:11.608 --> 19:12.776
<i>But not much.</i>

19:12.860 --> 19:15.445
<i>I'm afraid the girl in question
made a false report.</i>

19:16.321 --> 19:18.240
You sure we're talkin' about
the same case?

19:18.866 --> 19:21.546
<i>The particulars relayed to me
are real close to what I'm looking at.</i>

19:21.952 --> 19:22.952
<i>I mean,</i>

19:23.162 --> 19:24.037
real close.

19:24.121 --> 19:27.291
<i>Yeah, I... I hear ya, uh,
but I don't have a victim here.</i>

19:28.667 --> 19:29.667
Hmm.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.422
I... I don't know how to convince you, sir,

19:33.505 --> 19:35.924
but we're so sure
we're charging her with false reporting.

19:36.717 --> 19:37.885
Well, okay.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.512
I hope that works out for you guys.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.724
- You have a good day.
- Yeah, you too.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.254
Nonstop fun back here, isn't it?

20:15.255 --> 20:16.506
I don't really mind.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.554
I like that you're chill, Marie.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.390
I don't know many girls
could be sent back here

20:25.474 --> 20:29.811
and not end up making my brain bleed
with their nonstop talking.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.107
Are you this cool outside of work too?

20:38.195 --> 20:39.321
I'm not really...

20:40.572 --> 20:42.241
I'm not really cool anywhere.

20:42.532 --> 20:46.662
Uh, I should probably clock out
before I flip over to OT.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.167
What?

20:53.919 --> 20:56.255
You think I'm gonna do something
or something?

20:58.465 --> 20:59.967
I should just clock out.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.481
Relax, I'm just fucking with you.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.358
Oh.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.414
Hey.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.084
Milkshakes and a ride home.
Who's the best?

21:34.459 --> 21:36.219
- I have my bike.
- We'll put it in the back.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.495
- Which one do you want? Chocolate or...
- Stop, I don't want a stupid milkshake.

21:42.259 --> 21:45.139
We can take off the front tire,
you know. It'll fit in the back.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.470
I'm good.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.140
Marie, what's up?

21:49.057 --> 21:50.057
Are you okay?

21:51.184 --> 21:52.602
Do you really not want this?

21:53.312 --> 21:54.312
Marie.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.355
What?

21:55.439 --> 21:57.524
- What's going on? What happened?
- Nothing.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.817
Come on. Talk to me.

21:58.900 --> 21:59.900
Why?

22:00.235 --> 22:03.395
What are you gonna do about it? You gonna
beat up the creep in the loading dock?

22:03.655 --> 22:04.906
What are you talking about?

22:04.990 --> 22:06.533
Nothing. Just forget it.

22:06.616 --> 22:08.493
Hey, talk to me.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.078
I'm your friend, remember?

22:10.704 --> 22:12.914
Right. "I'm your friend,
I'm here for you."

22:12.998 --> 22:15.042
But how are you actually here for me?

22:15.375 --> 22:18.545
While all this shit's been happening,
what have you actually been doing to help?

22:18.628 --> 22:20.047
Are you serious right now?

22:21.173 --> 22:22.341
Get your hands off my bike.

22:22.424 --> 22:26.053
- I'm just asking you to tell me what...
- Get your hands off my bike!

22:27.512 --> 22:29.056
You're being totally unfair.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.558
You don't know anything about unfair.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.853
You have had everything handed to you,
everything easy.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.817
Screw you.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.320
Marie!

22:46.114 --> 22:49.284
You can't behave like this at work.
It's absolutely unacceptable.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.082
Fine, fuck it. I quit.

24:03.692 --> 24:07.612
All right, keep in mind ViCAP
makes connections based on MO.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.865
The other parallels:
physical descriptions,

24:09.948 --> 24:11.116
military background,

24:11.658 --> 24:13.618
those we have to dig for ourselves.

24:13.702 --> 24:14.786
Well, this is not our guy.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.630
He was locked up
at the time of Doris's rape.

24:16.705 --> 24:17.789
Here's something.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.376
A man arrested for cocaine possession
in Littleton last year.

24:21.460 --> 24:25.297
AO reported he had a rape kit on him
like the one Amber described.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.175
Gag, condoms, dildo, lubrication.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.844
Never charged with any sort
of sexual assault, but...

24:30.927 --> 24:32.220
Got a booking photo?

24:36.308 --> 24:38.351
Perversion knows no age limit, does it?

24:38.435 --> 24:39.936
Uh, too bad, eh, Rosemarie?

24:40.020 --> 24:42.100
In another life,
you two could've made a cute couple.

24:42.147 --> 24:45.108
Please, I haven't dated a man
over 45 since I was 30.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.820
Should I maybe separate out files

24:48.904 --> 24:51.156
where they suspect
law enforcement personnel?

24:54.534 --> 24:55.534
Why?

24:56.703 --> 24:57.703
Um...

24:58.830 --> 24:59.830
Mm...

25:00.749 --> 25:02.083
That's an angle you like?

25:03.168 --> 25:06.922
Well, it's not an angle I like,
but it is an angle that has merit.

25:07.797 --> 25:08.797
Based on what?

25:10.634 --> 25:11.634
The evidence.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.488
Interesting. Which evidence?

25:16.264 --> 25:18.183
Sorry, just catching up here.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.687
Every crime scene's been pristine.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.234
Every attack's in a different district.

25:27.817 --> 25:31.279
The fact that we managed to group them
was pure luck.

25:33.406 --> 25:34.407
Well...

25:35.492 --> 25:36.326
What?

25:36.409 --> 25:38.161
Civilians would have that information too.

25:38.245 --> 25:42.457
<i>CSI's </i> turned a generation of American
TV viewers into crime scene experts.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.834
Seriously? You don't like this angle
because of a TV show?

25:44.918 --> 25:47.504
Every FBI office coast to coast
will tell you the same thing.

25:47.587 --> 25:50.423
The number of clean crime scenes
has skyrocketed.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.509
I'm not saying don't look at cops.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.970
- Yes, you kind of are.
- No, don't misunderstand.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.304
Maybe I should remind you.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.492
Cops beat up their partners at two to four
times the rate of the general population.

25:59.516 --> 26:02.477
- I'm aware the numbers are higher.
- Add to that the fact that A:

26:02.561 --> 26:05.355
prior acts of violence against women
are the biggest predictor

26:05.438 --> 26:07.941
of whether a man will commit
sexual assault, and B:

26:08.024 --> 26:11.820
our suspect's better-than-<i>CSI </i> knowledge
of the police investigation procedure.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.780
And I don't think it's a stretch to say

26:13.863 --> 26:16.658
yes, this angle of looking for a cop
not only has merit,

26:17.033 --> 26:19.327
but you'd be a fucking idiot
not to pursue it.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.913
Hey, everyone! I brought gifts.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.833
Now, you're a tough group to shop for,

26:25.166 --> 26:29.588
but I think I managed to find
a little something for everyone.

26:29.671 --> 26:30.797
Turn them around.

26:31.172 --> 26:33.300
The brand, model, and size of this shoe

26:33.383 --> 26:37.220
match the pattern that was found at both
Lilly's house and Amber's apartment.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.304
And...

26:38.930 --> 26:39.973
honeycomb running gloves.

26:41.474 --> 26:42.892
Right on, sister.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.145
Nice work, Mia. Come on, grab a chair.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.520
Take mine.

26:48.732 --> 26:49.732
Excellent work.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.161
You left your dinner.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.414
Lost my appetite.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.169
Taggart's a good guy.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.255
He wasn't being intentionally hostile.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.051
Hmm, he's part of a hostile process.

27:21.931 --> 27:23.808
He's not wrong about <i>CSI.</i>

27:26.728 --> 27:27.728
You know that.

27:28.855 --> 27:29.855
Okay.

27:31.107 --> 27:32.359
Hypothetical scenario.

27:32.942 --> 27:35.236
A study comes out showing 40 percent
of female cops

27:35.320 --> 27:37.280
abuse their kids.
What do you think would happen?

27:37.364 --> 27:39.324
Forty percent of female cops
would lose their job.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.868
And that would be right.
That would be appropriate.

27:41.951 --> 27:43.721
Now, look at this.
This is a study from Florida

27:43.745 --> 27:46.289
where, like, everywhere
there are cops beating their wives.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.166
Guess how many of them
are still on the job?

27:49.959 --> 27:51.002
Thirty percent.

27:52.212 --> 27:56.508
Everyone knows,
huge correlation between violence at home

27:56.591 --> 27:58.218
and violence against strangers,

27:58.301 --> 28:01.471
and even so,
a third of wife-beating cops in Florida

28:01.554 --> 28:03.434
are still walking around with a badge
and a gun.

28:03.473 --> 28:06.559
I hear ya. I just don't think
that's entirely Taggart's fault.

28:06.643 --> 28:11.022
Well, it's no one's fault entirely.
That's the problem, no one's accountable.

28:11.106 --> 28:14.275
No one is looking at this data
about violence against women.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.486
I mean, what if men were raped
at the rate women are?

28:16.569 --> 28:19.249
What if Taggart was worried a stranger
was gonna fuck him in the ass

28:19.280 --> 28:20.880
walking from the grocery store at night?

28:20.907 --> 28:22.909
This man is helping us.
This man is stepping up.

28:22.992 --> 28:24.202
Okay!

28:26.037 --> 28:28.081
But where is his outrage?

28:29.958 --> 28:33.086
You know? Where is the voice
looking at this pattern saying,

28:33.420 --> 28:35.422
"This is supremely fucked up!"

28:35.505 --> 28:36.505
It is.

28:37.048 --> 28:40.093
But you sitting out here,
screaming into the wind,

28:40.593 --> 28:42.220
does nothing to un-fuck it.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.517
We found a ViCAP hit I wanna show you.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.394
What is it?

28:49.477 --> 28:51.271
Just come back in for Pete's sake.

28:56.192 --> 28:57.193
You said "fuck."

28:58.027 --> 28:59.154
I was making a point.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.073
Look at me getting the nice church gal
to go all potty-mouthed.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.199
Shut the fuck up.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.827
And they say women
don't mentor other women.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.539
A series of unsolved rapes
at the University of Kansas,

29:09.622 --> 29:12.375
2000 to 2008.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.587
White male, 26 to 35-years-old,

29:15.670 --> 29:19.716
five-foot-nine to six-feet, calm,
direct demeanor.

29:20.258 --> 29:24.220
Black mask, bindings,
early morning attacks,

29:24.304 --> 29:25.555
the victims in bed.

29:25.638 --> 29:28.600
A video camera was used to film the rapes,

29:28.892 --> 29:30.852
a rape kit and handgun involved.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.897
And he would make them shower
for 20 minutes

29:34.314 --> 29:36.274
to get rid of any DNA evidence.

29:38.860 --> 29:39.860
Wow.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.321
Shit.

29:43.072 --> 29:46.284
After the last attack in January 2008,

29:47.118 --> 29:48.118
he vanished.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.681
I'll check police transfer records

29:50.705 --> 29:52.832
between Kansas and Colorado
around that time.

29:53.833 --> 29:54.833
Thank you.

29:56.002 --> 29:57.002
Well...

29:57.378 --> 30:00.840
one thing's for sure, someone needs
to get out to Kansas immediately.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.267
What is that?

30:13.478 --> 30:14.478
What are you doing?

30:15.021 --> 30:18.149
We know what you're doing.
You're going to Kansas.

30:19.901 --> 30:23.530
<i>Highs in the mid-sixties
with humidity at 67%. Winds...</i>

30:23.613 --> 30:26.074

hey, they got so many trees...</i>

31:18.877 --> 31:21.546
Any data sets we can pull
from the shoe and the glove?

31:21.796 --> 31:24.549
I'm pulling sales records
from every retailer in the county

31:24.632 --> 31:27.635
going back to the original
manufacture date of both items.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.762
It's a lot of paperwork.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.848
I wasn't aware
we had anything better to do.

31:31.931 --> 31:36.019
I got a list of restraining orders issued
against domestic abusers in the area,

31:36.102 --> 31:37.520
going back five years.

31:37.604 --> 31:41.858
We can cross-reference them with your list
of cops with military backgrounds.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.790
Yeah, you got a program that can do that?

31:43.818 --> 31:48.740
Nah. Coding it would take longer
than good old-fashioned manpower.

31:48.823 --> 31:51.701
Oh! You want a high-tech gadget?

31:53.036 --> 31:55.705
Don't worry. We'll divide and conquer.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.251
I had a thought.

32:02.420 --> 32:06.090
Well, um, with each victim,
there was a theft.

32:06.174 --> 32:08.760
He... he took their underwear.
I was thinking...

32:09.135 --> 32:11.763
maybe he stole
other women's underwear too.

32:11.846 --> 32:14.349
Uh, like, women he stalked
but didn't attack.

32:14.432 --> 32:18.478
Maybe if I search, you know,
for lost underwear reports,

32:18.561 --> 32:20.605
maybe those thefts were reported...

32:22.857 --> 32:24.567
What? Is that...

32:25.068 --> 32:27.946
Hello, Westminster Police?
Yes, I have a dire emergency to report.

32:28.029 --> 32:30.198
It's my panties! They're gone!

32:31.074 --> 32:34.953
A man stealing a gal's underwear
is not that uncommon, Elias,

32:35.036 --> 32:36.287
but a gal reporting it...

32:36.371 --> 32:37.413
Doesn't happen.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.375
Fun fact, women's undies go AWOL
all the time.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.877
They are truly working their own program.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.046
If you happen to even notice
you're missing a pair.

32:45.129 --> 32:45.964
Which you don't.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.091
No, you might,
if they're special date night undies.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.677
But even then,
you assume they're caught in a dryer

32:50.760 --> 32:52.387
or stuck in a pant leg somewhere.

32:53.930 --> 32:57.684
Yeah, I guess I don't, uh,
know a lot about that.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.185
Hey, it'd be weird if you did.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.981
You know what?
No such thing as a bad idea.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.232
Go ahead and run it down.

33:04.482 --> 33:05.650
Oh, no. That's okay.

33:05.733 --> 33:06.943
No, she's right.

33:07.026 --> 33:09.278
Cases have been cracked
with sillier hunches.

33:09.612 --> 33:10.655
You go for it.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.658
You know, he's right about one thing.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.995
Our guy has patterns of other behavior
besides assault.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.372
- Like?
- Like stalking.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.625
He watches his victims.

33:23.501 --> 33:24.585
Probably for a while.

33:26.587 --> 33:28.297
Most likely from a car.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.688
Elias, when you're done
with your, uh, panties,

33:44.188 --> 33:46.607
I want you to pull every report
of suspicious vehicles

33:46.691 --> 33:48.860
within half a mile
of each of our victims' residences.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.864
Who knows, maybe someone saw him.

34:00.329 --> 34:01.873
Thanks for staying late.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.127
I-70 through Topeka was miserable.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.420
Uh, no problem.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.755
This case has kept me up more nights
than I can count.

34:14.217 --> 34:15.428
Look at that.

34:15.678 --> 34:17.929
Yeah, if there was a stone,
I turned it over.

34:19.264 --> 34:21.266
Funny, as I was pulling everything,

34:21.559 --> 34:25.271
I realized these files chart
my first eight years as a detective.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.982
I got promoted a year
before the first attack.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.277
You'll see in the reports,
I was hanging on for dear life.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.237
Yeah, I've been there.

34:35.614 --> 34:39.077
Sometimes I wonder, if I had been
the detective I am now back then...

34:39.452 --> 34:40.578
Hmm.

34:40.745 --> 34:44.290
I just hope something in there
helps bring the fucker down.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.884
Have you seen that?

34:55.676 --> 34:58.054
Not this, uh, particular textbook, no.

34:58.137 --> 35:00.306
Yeah, it was written to train cops,

35:00.389 --> 35:03.101
but I stumbled across it
on a Dark Web message board.

35:03.518 --> 35:08.439
Men use it to study how cops catch rapists
so they can avoid the usual traps.

35:09.023 --> 35:10.024
Mm.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.445
So, as much as we're hoping
we're looking at the same guy,

35:14.987 --> 35:17.406
it could just be two guys
with the same book?

35:17.490 --> 35:18.616
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

36:08.666 --> 36:13.129
<i>âª 'Cause I ain't in no hurry today âª</i>

36:25.183 --> 36:28.519
<i>âª There's nothing wrong

36:28.603 --> 36:30.938
<i>âª And the smell of early spring âª</i>

36:31.981 --> 36:34.734
<i>âª Sit down in a fold-up easy chair âª</i>

36:37.653 --> 36:38.654
Hey, Trish!

36:40.031 --> 36:41.073
We beat the rush.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.784
I threw in onion rings
as a thanks.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.162
- Aw, thank you.
- Let's make it a habit, okay?

36:46.370 --> 36:48.831
Well, can't promise with these bitches.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.959
Twenty-one sixty-five tonight.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.438
- Thanks. The rest is for you, Trish.
- Thank you.

36:54.462 --> 36:55.463
- 'Night!
- Good night.

36:55.546 --> 36:56.672
Bye.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.925
You guys gonna come over?

37:10.228 --> 37:12.230
- You want a box, hon?
- No, thanks.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.314
Thank you.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.599
<i>âª When I must return âª</i>

37:49.016 --> 37:51.769
<i>âª To the cold cold ground âª</i>

37:52.728 --> 37:55.106

38:04.115 --> 38:05.616
Steve?

38:06.242 --> 38:07.994
Hey, sweetie. I'm back here.

38:16.711 --> 38:17.586
You eaten?

38:17.670 --> 38:19.839
Uh, I ordered Chinese 15 minutes ago...

38:21.757 --> 38:23.884
but I came in here to earn my lo mein.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.886
Proud of me?

38:26.178 --> 38:27.178
Big time.

38:35.187 --> 38:36.188
You need something?

38:40.693 --> 38:41.693
Yeah.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.454
Just one file.

38:52.830 --> 38:56.375
A patrol officer from Franklin Heights
named James Massey.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.460
He's a nomad cop,

38:57.543 --> 39:00.671
gets tossed around from department
to department like bad garbage.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.673
His wife took out a restraining order.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.216
I mean, violent past,

39:04.300 --> 39:07.094
DNA and jurisdiction savvy
by virtue of profession.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.406
- Perfect physical match.
- Gracie, we talked about this.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.640
No, it's different. It's just one file.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.893
The Attorney General's office
is clear about protocol

39:13.976 --> 39:15.519
when it comes to record requests,

39:15.603 --> 39:18.022
and "my wife has a hunch" doesn't cut it.

39:19.315 --> 39:22.360
God! I'm asking you for help.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.653
That's what you're always
telling me to do.

39:24.737 --> 39:28.407
Reach out, open up, don't wall off.
Well, here I am.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.409
That's about you being
emotionally present.

39:30.493 --> 39:31.994
This is not that, and you know that.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.413
Right. So, if I were crying, we'd be good?

39:40.711 --> 39:41.712
That's dinner.

39:46.258 --> 39:49.303
Fine. When he rapes again,
it's on your conscience.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.515
Uh, no, hon. It won't be.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.468
Hey, Tommy, it's Grace Rasmussen.
How you doin'?

40:30.094 --> 40:30.928
Good to hear.

40:31.011 --> 40:33.472
Listen, we're putting together
a police softball league,

40:33.556 --> 40:36.392
and I hear you've got some fine players
over there at Franklin Heights.

40:37.643 --> 40:41.021
No, no, you're busy. I can call them all,
I just need their numbers.

40:42.898 --> 40:44.108
Yeah, uh...

40:45.192 --> 40:48.070
the first guy's name is James Massey.
