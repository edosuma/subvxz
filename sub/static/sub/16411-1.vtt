00:26.125 --> 00:27.333
Barber:
How you living?

00:27.333 --> 00:28.417
The Guy: I'm good, man.
Good.

00:28.417 --> 00:30.667
So what I can do
for you today?

00:30.667 --> 00:32.750
I'm thinking just
a little off the top.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.750
Nothing-- nothing too drastic.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.750
I see this man
on subway today

00:36.750 --> 00:37.834
who look like you.

00:37.834 --> 00:39.417
Oh, okay.
Yeah, and I think,

00:39.417 --> 00:42.583
I want to try haircut
like his for you.

00:42.583 --> 00:45.625
Okay.
But his hair was much thicker.

00:48.166 --> 00:49.792
Well, you know,
mine's going,

00:49.792 --> 00:51.708
and I'm okay with it.
Yeah, no kidding it's going.

00:51.708 --> 00:54.291
I can't do anything
with this hair anymore.

00:54.291 --> 00:55.708
This is not enough.

00:55.708 --> 00:57.959
There's-- there's
a good amount of hair.

00:57.959 --> 00:59.208
There's good amount,
but listen,

00:59.208 --> 01:01.458
I am a barber,
not a magician.

01:01.458 --> 01:04.458
But I will
do what I can.
Okay.

01:04.458 --> 01:06.500
(phone chirping)

01:07.667 --> 01:08.917
Hey, Johnny.
What's up, man?

01:08.917 --> 01:11.250
What's up, my man?
I need some weed, brother.
Uh...

01:11.250 --> 01:13.417
ASAP.
Look-- Hold on.
Excuse me.

01:13.417 --> 01:14.458
Absolutely.

01:14.458 --> 01:15.959
Um...
Take your time.

01:15.959 --> 01:18.458
It's gonna be probably
like two hours.
Fuck, man.

01:18.458 --> 01:20.125
Okay, well, just so you know,
I'm hurtin'.

01:20.125 --> 01:22.583
So with the quickness, please.
Yeah, I'll see
what I can do, man.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.750
All right. You do that.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.125
You want to come back
in two hours?

01:26.125 --> 01:28.333
No, I-- I just gotta
get back to work,

01:28.333 --> 01:29.834
but, uh--
Okay, good. That's--

01:29.834 --> 01:31.125
Just do the top.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.542
Just the top? Okay.

01:32.542 --> 01:34.208
This is even simple.

01:34.208 --> 01:35.500
Just the top.

01:35.500 --> 01:38.208
This is like you go
to your mechanic in car

01:38.208 --> 01:39.708
and you say,
"Only fix the bumper.

01:39.708 --> 01:40.875
Don't fix the engine."

01:40.875 --> 01:42.750
It makes no sense,
but I will do it.

01:42.750 --> 01:44.125
Spasiba.

Johnny:
Why are you embarrassed?
You look fucking hot!

02:28.166 --> 02:30.208
Lisa:
Why are you talking like this?

02:30.208 --> 02:31.875
You sound like you're out
of your fucking mind!

02:31.875 --> 02:33.542
You sound like you're out
of your fucking mind

02:33.542 --> 02:35.208
'cause why would you
invest all this time

02:35.208 --> 02:37.041
and money
into belly dancing classes

02:37.041 --> 02:40.083
and then not want to
dance for anyone?
Because I'm not dancing for you

02:40.083 --> 02:42.291
and your stupid little friends,
you fucking idiots!

02:42.291 --> 02:44.083
Hey, well, excuse me!

02:44.083 --> 02:46.375
I guess I can't fucking do
anything right, can I?
No, you can't do anything right!

02:46.375 --> 02:48.625
I'm just the worst
boyfriend ever.
I mean, like seriously?

02:48.625 --> 02:50.166
In the universe.
Do you hear yourself?

02:50.166 --> 02:52.166
You're trying to act like some
bad-ass, "Fast and the Furious"

02:52.166 --> 02:54.834
whatever Vin Diesel type
shit this is, and, you know,
Hey, hey, hey, all right,

02:54.834 --> 02:57.250
let's just cool out, babe.
I can't even stand
this shit anymore.

02:57.250 --> 02:58.500
Cool out?
Yeah.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.291
You're fucking crazy!
Don't hit my flat!

03:00.291 --> 03:03.041
I will do
whatever the fuck
I want in your flat!

03:03.041 --> 03:05.417
Listen, let's just talk.
Cool out. I can't
fucking cool out.

03:05.417 --> 03:06.583
You cool out!

03:06.583 --> 03:08.083
Who?
Just like last night
like when you were,

03:08.083 --> 03:10.208
you were doing
with that fucking
dude in the club.

03:10.208 --> 03:12.375
I mean, seriously!
You mean when
I was protecting you

03:12.375 --> 03:14.834
from that asshole thug?
Protecting me?
You call that protecting me?

03:14.834 --> 03:17.000
Yes. That's one of my love
languages, protection.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.583
He was trying to
get to the bathroom

03:18.583 --> 03:20.458
and it was crowded! My God!
Oh, oh.

03:20.458 --> 03:21.750
You think I don't know
that trick?

03:21.750 --> 03:23.333
You think I don't know
that trick?
Oh, a trick?

03:23.333 --> 03:25.875
I'm trying to keep you safe.
You know what? You're insane.

03:25.875 --> 03:27.792
You're fucking insane.
Stop calling me crazy!

03:27.792 --> 03:29.125
I didn't call you crazy!

03:29.125 --> 03:30.291
I called you insane!

03:30.291 --> 03:31.959
And I'm done! Fuck you,

03:31.959 --> 03:34.250
and fuck you!
What? Hey! Hey!

03:34.250 --> 03:37.291
What the fuck
did Chauncey do? Nothing.

03:37.291 --> 03:39.000
You need to apologize.
Whatever.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.875
Look, please,
Lisa, don't leave.
Whatever. Fuck off.

03:40.875 --> 03:42.250
No. I'm leaving.
Goddammit, Lisa.

03:42.250 --> 03:44.542
If you leave you out that door,
you ain't coming back.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.000
Watch.
Lisa, don't leave!

03:46.000 --> 03:48.333
Goddammit!

03:48.333 --> 03:50.458
What the fuck you doing
out there, brother? Come in.

03:50.458 --> 03:53.000
I was just giving you
a minute, man.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.417
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

03:54.417 --> 03:55.625
She needs a minute.

03:55.625 --> 03:56.792
Lisa:
You need a minute!

03:56.792 --> 03:59.959
Fucking crazy woman!
You're fucking crazy!

03:59.959 --> 04:01.500
Man.

04:02.458 --> 04:03.625
She's gorgeous though, right?

04:03.625 --> 04:05.291
Oh, yeah.
I mean, you saw her.

04:05.291 --> 04:07.041
Don't get any ideas.

04:07.041 --> 04:09.250
Okay?
I--

04:09.250 --> 04:10.458
No, no--
Kidding.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.333
Oh.
She wouldn't go for you.

04:13.458 --> 04:14.750
You're not her type.

04:14.750 --> 04:18.208
She likes a more clean,
put together... presentation.

04:18.208 --> 04:19.959
You know.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.083
Yeah.

04:21.083 --> 04:22.542
Uh...

04:22.542 --> 04:24.375
sorry to hear you guys
are having troubles, man.

04:24.375 --> 04:28.083
Yeah.
This is a, uh, sativa, indica.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.375
Those are a hundred--

04:29.375 --> 04:31.375
She said some pretty cold
shit to me just now.
Oh. Yeah.

04:31.375 --> 04:32.667
Telling me that I'm selfish.

04:32.667 --> 04:35.500
But do you know
how much shit that
I do for her?

04:35.500 --> 04:36.834
No.
(scoffs)

04:36.834 --> 04:39.333
She doesn't even realize
how much shit that I sacrifice

04:39.333 --> 04:40.959
to keep this relationship going.

04:40.959 --> 04:42.792
I mean, 'cause believe me,

04:42.792 --> 04:44.500
I got ample
opportunity for pussy

04:44.500 --> 04:46.667
every time I hit that door.
Ain't that right Chauncey?

04:46.667 --> 04:48.333
Mm.
Chauncey know.

04:48.333 --> 04:51.166
Me too.
(bong burbling)

04:51.166 --> 04:53.500
(holding breath)
That's what I'm saying, man.

04:57.542 --> 04:59.208
Oh, I can't, man.
I gotta--

04:59.208 --> 05:00.542
What, you don't want
to smoke with us?
No,

05:00.542 --> 05:02.750
I just have other clients
I gotta get to, so, uh--

05:02.750 --> 05:05.542
You want me to just leave
the money on the counter
like you're a hooker?

05:05.542 --> 05:08.375
No, I-- I--
Ohh.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.542
I know.

05:09.542 --> 05:10.875
I know.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.625
You think I'm some kind
of loser, right?

05:12.625 --> 05:15.083
No, I--
Like I don't know how
to keep a woman satisfied.

05:15.083 --> 05:18.583
I didn't say that.
Right. What kind of guy am I?
I get it. I get it. I get it!

05:18.583 --> 05:19.875
(continues punching)

05:19.875 --> 05:22.750
Hey, hey, I--
I can have a hit.

05:23.792 --> 05:25.000
I'll take a hit.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.542
(lighter flicks)
(bong burbles)

05:26.542 --> 05:27.875
Nice, brother.

05:27.875 --> 05:30.208
Still pulling?
We got more.

05:30.208 --> 05:31.875
You got more.
(coughs)

05:31.875 --> 05:35.625
In Denmark,
they tax the prostitutes
is all I'm saying.

05:35.625 --> 05:37.792
Uruguay, it's all legal.

05:37.792 --> 05:39.667
Sss! Drugs and prostitutes.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.166
Yeah, yeah.
Sss!

05:41.166 --> 05:42.875
It's part of the culture there.

05:42.875 --> 05:46.041
Cool, man. You know a lot
about... prostitutes.

05:46.041 --> 05:49.542
It's really impressive.
Hey, what do you think
of my arms?

05:51.583 --> 05:53.083
What about you?

05:54.125 --> 05:55.417
Think my arms are jacked?

05:55.417 --> 05:57.625
Yeah, man.
They're jacked.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.000
Yeah. I think so, too.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.125
Cool arms.

06:01.125 --> 06:03.041
So listen, you got
the Dank Sinatra,

06:03.041 --> 06:04.834
and then you got
a quarter of O.G. Kush,

06:04.834 --> 06:07.917
so that's--
that's $200, man.
Hey, uh...

06:07.917 --> 06:09.917
would you, uh,
ever want to start

06:09.917 --> 06:11.917
one of those
customer loyalty programs

06:11.917 --> 06:15.208
like buy one, get one free,
you know, for people like me?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.750
Uh...

06:16.750 --> 06:18.875
I can't do that
'cause I don't--

06:18.875 --> 06:21.083
My business isn't going
well enough

06:21.083 --> 06:22.583
to give away free product.
Really?

06:22.583 --> 06:23.542
Yeah. Yeah.

06:23.542 --> 06:25.875
Even after I invite you
into my home,

06:25.875 --> 06:28.166
give you hospitality,
serve you my special mate?

06:28.166 --> 06:29.500
Mate.
Mate.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.083
No--
Doesn't that count
for anything?

06:31.083 --> 06:33.333
Oh, no, it really does.
I appreciate it, man,

06:33.333 --> 06:35.959
and like I said--
Well, what about, like,
a free joint or something?

06:35.959 --> 06:38.166
You know, I don't have
any pre-rolled, so I can't--

06:38.166 --> 06:39.625
Well, fuck,
I'll roll one.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.583
Chauncey, roll
a spliff, will ya?

06:45.291 --> 06:46.792
Whoa, what's the rush?

06:46.792 --> 06:49.291
Colin says you hang out
and smoke with him all the time.

06:49.291 --> 06:51.959
I know, but, you know,
when I have time, I do

06:51.959 --> 06:53.667
'cause, you know,
we've known each other a while,

06:53.667 --> 06:55.583
we're friends, and--
What, we're not friends?

06:55.583 --> 06:57.291
We're friends.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.708
I just...

06:58.708 --> 07:01.000
I've only met you twice, so...

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
I didn't think to say
we were friends yet.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.000
I'm kidding.
Oh. Okay.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.834
I know, I'm a customer.

07:08.834 --> 07:09.959
Okay.
I get it.

07:09.959 --> 07:11.208
I get it too.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.417
But I'm in your top five
customer-wise though, right?

07:13.417 --> 07:15.834
Oh, yeah. You're--
you're my favorite customer.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.917
Look, Johnny,
I really gotta get going.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.333
I'm very busy right now, okay?

07:19.333 --> 07:22.125
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. No problem.

07:22.125 --> 07:23.208
Sss!

07:26.000 --> 07:27.750

07:27.750 --> 07:30.166
You look cool
with that katana, brother.

07:30.166 --> 07:32.542
Thank you.
You should consider getting one.

Well, fuck, bro.

08:28.583 --> 08:30.125
I don't mean
to be disrespectful,

08:30.125 --> 08:32.250

afford to do some lifting.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.625
Um...
I'm surprised all that bike
riding doesn't' keep you--

08:34.625 --> 08:36.041
Hey careful!
Oh, God.

08:36.041 --> 08:38.083
This is an authentic
samurai sword

08:38.083 --> 08:40.083
forged at the base
of Mount Fuji.

08:41.667 --> 08:45.583
I... I really gotta get to--
You should do some
high intensity intervals

08:45.583 --> 08:47.041
if you want to lose that gut.
Mm-hmm.

08:47.041 --> 08:48.667
You could even do 'em
on that bike of yours.

08:48.667 --> 08:51.250
Yeah.
I highly recommend
one of these guys.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.542

of these every day...

08:53.542 --> 08:54.792

08:54.792 --> 08:57.917
those coins wouldn't be
so heavy for you, would they?

(panting)

09:04.417 --> 09:06.291
(panting)

09:13.625 --> 09:14.959
Yeah, I guess you're right.

09:14.959 --> 09:16.708
So I'm...

09:16.708 --> 09:19.125
I need $200
in cash, man.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.125
Please?
Listen, bro,

09:22.125 --> 09:23.959
if you're business
isn't doing too well,

09:23.959 --> 09:25.458
I can lend you some cash

09:25.458 --> 09:27.083
at a low
interest rate of course.

09:27.083 --> 09:29.125
Yeah? Oh, thanks.
It's not that.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.792
It's just that I have
other people who are waiting
for me to come to them.

09:31.792 --> 09:34.458
Oh! How 'bout this?

09:34.458 --> 09:38.834
I could help you out
by coming on as a consultant.

09:38.834 --> 09:41.375
Like for-- for example,

09:41.375 --> 09:43.917
maybe if you hired
some employees,

09:43.917 --> 09:46.125
you could sell more weed!

09:47.000 --> 09:48.291
That one's free.

09:49.291 --> 09:51.000
That's a great idea.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.834
I'll think about it.
So, you know
I would ask for half.

09:53.834 --> 09:56.208
Of course. Of course.
(phone rings)

09:56.208 --> 09:58.667
Oh, hold on one second.
This is Lisa right here.

09:58.667 --> 09:59.959
Oh.
Hold on.

09:59.959 --> 10:02.667
Are you calling
'cause you're ready
to talk reasonably?

10:02.667 --> 10:03.917
Wait, what?

10:03.917 --> 10:06.625
(rap music playing)

10:08.708 --> 10:10.500
Johnny:
Who said that to you?
That's fucking bullshit.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.959
Hey, man.
I did not.
That's bullshit! I did not.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.333
If-- if she's the one
who told you that, then yes,

10:18.333 --> 10:20.667
your sister is a liar.

10:20.667 --> 10:21.917
Well, I would tell her

10:21.917 --> 10:24.000
if she wants to come over here
and say that to my face,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.208
and show me her said proof,
then maybe we can talk.

10:27.208 --> 10:30.041
But that is bullshit
because it didn't happen.
You guys roommates?

10:32.041 --> 10:33.375
Yeah!

10:34.542 --> 10:35.750
Uh-huh.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.875
What's up, baby?
Don't talk like that.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.542
Okay? Don't talk like that.

10:40.542 --> 10:43.500
Thank you.
On top of everything else,
I didn't do anything at all,

10:43.500 --> 10:45.542
so there's no "on top of"
and there's no this!

10:45.542 --> 10:46.750
I'm just gonna...

10:46.750 --> 10:50.875
I'm watching, I'm--
but you're not listening!

10:50.875 --> 10:53.875
I'm talking to my girlfriend.
Keep the change,
you filthy animal.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.708
Johnny:
I love you.

10:57.625 --> 10:58.750
Thank you.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.333
(footsteps ascending)

11:08.959 --> 11:10.834
Where the fuck did he go?

11:10.834 --> 11:12.959
(Cockney accent)
He left.

11:12.959 --> 11:14.208
(English accent)
Really?

11:15.583 --> 11:16.917
Just like that?

11:16.917 --> 11:20.417
Mm. I told him,
"Keep the change,
you filthy animal."

11:20.417 --> 11:22.875
"Home Alone."
Nice, mate. Good one.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.917
So what'd you think?
How was it?

11:28.917 --> 11:31.750
Your accent was a little wonky
in certain places,

11:31.750 --> 11:32.917
but I don't want
to get into that.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.708
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

11:34.708 --> 11:36.542
Yeah. Right.
Can't say "flat."

11:36.542 --> 11:38.417
It's just a dead giveaway.

11:38.417 --> 11:40.792
And I don't know
if they say "spliff" here.

11:40.792 --> 11:42.667
Doesn't even matter. Listen.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.750
The character is
coming along quite nicely.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.917
It's a great exercise.
Very helpful.

11:46.917 --> 11:48.041
Tell you what,

11:48.041 --> 11:49.583
they see this
next week in class,

11:49.583 --> 11:51.500
it's gonna knock
their tits off. Watch.

11:51.500 --> 11:54.125
(American accent)
Keep the change,
you filthy animal. Fucking A.

11:54.125 --> 11:55.500
(chuckles)

12:12.625 --> 12:14.083
This is falling
off my face. Great.

12:14.083 --> 12:16.667
Okay, quick photo.
Do the, um, square one.
Here's mine.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.417
I know how to use
an iPhone, babe.
Okay, cool.

12:18.417 --> 12:19.959
But, ladies, keep
your legs together

12:19.959 --> 12:22.250
because after
a long day at work,
I don't want to see that!

12:22.250 --> 12:24.333
(all laugh)
Hey, Tabs, I'm looking at you.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.333
I don't want to see that.
Lock that up.
Sorry.

12:26.333 --> 12:29.667
(overlapping chatter)
Who else wishes
Max was straight?

12:29.667 --> 12:32.500
Whoo!
Back off, bitch.
Get your own gay husband.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.500
Oh, wait, you're
marrying him next month.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.625
Okay, ladies,
everybody say,

12:35.625 --> 12:38.000
"I tell my boyfriend
he's normal-sized!"

12:38.000 --> 12:39.500
I do!
Max, just take
the fucking picture.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.375
Say, "Beyoncé!"

12:41.375 --> 12:44.875
All: Beyoncé!
(phone shutter clicks)

12:44.875 --> 12:45.834
Yas, kweens!

12:45.834 --> 12:49.000
Oh, my God,
you're killing it. Work!

12:49.000 --> 12:50.750
Yas, kween.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.333
Work. Yas.

12:52.333 --> 12:55.125
It's like, we get it,
you have access to social media.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.583
Okay, what about the one
who said she used to
roofie herself?

12:57.583 --> 13:00.333
Yeah, we all did that,
but I know who you're
talking about: Courtney.

13:00.333 --> 13:03.125
She's crazy.
She was telling me
about all her abortions.

13:03.125 --> 13:06.834
Yeah, we used to
say Planned Parenthood
gave her a punch card.

13:06.834 --> 13:08.583
Okay, that sounds
like a Chelsea Handler joke.

13:08.583 --> 13:10.208
I will Google it.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.250
(party music playing)

13:12.250 --> 13:14.875
Max, can you fix my braids?
They're coming loose.
Yes, baby,

13:14.875 --> 13:16.667
but I need bobby pins
'cause y'all cleaned me out.

13:16.667 --> 13:21.125
Know what I'm saying?
Oh, I have
three words for y'all!

13:21.125 --> 13:23.875
New Orleans spring break! Oww!

13:23.875 --> 13:25.250
Go get us bobby pins.
Okay.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.625
Oh, also, we are out of vodka.

13:26.625 --> 13:28.166
Aren't you going out later?
Yeah.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.750
But we wanna do
vodka tampons.

13:29.750 --> 13:30.875
(retches)

13:30.875 --> 13:32.834
♪ Yeah, I'm a diva ♪

13:50.208 --> 13:52.875
♪ ♪

13:56.500 --> 13:59.917
♪ Open your eyes ♪

14:04.834 --> 14:07.834
♪ And every little kiss ♪

14:07.834 --> 14:12.458
♪ Oh, take me with you ♪

14:17.542 --> 14:20.750
♪ Take me back ♪

14:26.166 --> 14:30.875
♪ Oh, take me ♪

14:32.041 --> 14:34.083
(both grunting)
(furniture creaks)

14:35.417 --> 14:37.125
Oh, my God.

14:38.291 --> 14:39.500
Oh, Jesus.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.667
Come on.
Oh, my God.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.166
What is your rent like?

14:43.166 --> 14:46.417
You heard about
the whole debacle
with the swing snapping, right?

14:46.417 --> 14:48.708
That did not happen.
Oh, man, it was so bad.

14:48.708 --> 14:50.333
This poor,

14:50.333 --> 14:53.458
dear older woman went down.

14:53.458 --> 14:54.917
No, please.

14:54.917 --> 14:57.625
You could hear it echo
throughout the entire Armory.
Oh, my God.

14:57.625 --> 15:00.625
Luckily, nobody got hurt.
But, I mean, you could just

15:00.625 --> 15:03.959
imagine her poor, frail bones
just getting pulverized.

15:03.959 --> 15:05.917
If you watch
"The Artist is Present"
documentary,

15:05.917 --> 15:07.834
you can see me in the background
when that naked girl

15:07.834 --> 15:09.125
gets escorted out
by the guards.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.708
Uh-huh.
And I'm, like,
giving here a look.

15:10.708 --> 15:12.500
I'm like...
(chuckles)

15:12.500 --> 15:14.667
She's actually my friend.
That's Josephine.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.667
She's a genius filmmaker.
Oh, yeah?

15:16.667 --> 15:18.500
Yeah.
And what's your name,
by the way?

15:18.500 --> 15:20.583
(both chuckle)
I'm Max.

15:20.583 --> 15:21.959
Nice to meet you, Max.

15:21.959 --> 15:24.000
You might remember me
from when I was eating
out your asshole.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.166
You know, I thought you looked
familiar from somewhere.
Yeah.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.500
I'm Sebastian.
Oh, cool.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.500
(phone chimes)
Oh, sorry.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.000
Would you--
Sure. Yeah. Uh-huh.

15:33.125 --> 15:34.333
Sorry.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.333
Oh, shit. I gotta go, man.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.625
Um, it was a pleasure
to fuck you, Max.

15:40.625 --> 15:42.917
You haven't seen my jumpsuit
anywhere, have you?

15:42.917 --> 15:44.708
What? Are you going
somewhere fun? Can I come?

15:44.708 --> 15:47.417
Um, um, I actually
have to go to a meeting.

15:47.417 --> 15:48.750
I'm in recovery.

15:48.750 --> 15:49.834
(phone chimes)

15:51.625 --> 15:53.959
I'm actually
in recovery too.
I am, too.

15:53.959 --> 15:56.375
Yeah?
And I'm really overdue
for a meeting.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.583
Well, maybe we should
go together.
I'd love that.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.208
Hey, y'all.
I'm Darnell. Addict.

16:01.208 --> 16:02.583
All:
Hi, Darnell.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.000
Hey, everybody.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.125
Today, girl...

16:06.125 --> 16:08.959
if I make it through this day
without smoking tina,

16:08.959 --> 16:11.375
then it is literally
by the grace of God

16:11.375 --> 16:12.959
and it had nothing
to do with me.

16:12.959 --> 16:15.708
Everything's a trigger today.
Everything. Like a shoe.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.458
Like, oh, I remember
that time I saw that shoe.

16:17.458 --> 16:20.000
When I was smoking that tina
and then I was, like, blowing

16:20.000 --> 16:22.250
that guy behind the dumpster.
It was, like, literally
like that.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.250
So I'm at the, um, laundromat
and this song comes on.

16:25.250 --> 16:28.208
Within like the first
two notes of the song,

16:28.208 --> 16:29.875
I look down
and I'm like,

16:29.875 --> 16:32.959
"All right. Yeah, now is
the time to get a boner."

16:32.959 --> 16:35.667
This is when-- this is when
you really want one, right?

16:35.667 --> 16:37.208
At the laundromat!

16:37.208 --> 16:38.250
(laughter)

16:38.250 --> 16:40.125
When you're looking
at some lady named Wanda.

16:40.125 --> 16:43.250
Right? Me and Wanda.
I'm like, "Hey, Wanda."

16:43.250 --> 16:44.583
She's over there
just clueless.

16:44.583 --> 16:47.208
She's like, "Oh it's so good
to see you, Darnell!"

16:47.208 --> 16:50.041
I'm like, "Apparently not
as good as it is to see
you, honey."

16:50.041 --> 16:52.750
(all laughing)

16:52.750 --> 16:55.041
What I'm supposed to say is
addicts have two days.

16:55.041 --> 16:57.083
You have good days
and you have great days.

16:57.083 --> 17:00.125
A good day is when,
like, everything goes

17:00.125 --> 17:02.250
like, your way
and you don't use,

17:02.250 --> 17:04.291
and then a great day
is when literally

17:04.291 --> 17:07.417
nothing goes your way
and you still don't use.

17:07.417 --> 17:11.333
So, this is gonna be
a great fucking day, all right?
(laughs)

17:11.333 --> 17:13.917
Her boyfriend was just
stumbling around Brooklyn

17:13.917 --> 17:15.917
like a Polack on Christmas.

17:15.917 --> 17:17.250
Oh, my God.
Just remind me

17:17.250 --> 17:19.083
never to go out
with those people again.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.875
Okay, I will.
(groans)

17:21.875 --> 17:25.125
I need, like, the biggest,
narstiest breakfast sandwich

17:25.125 --> 17:26.959
to soak up
all this alcohol. (gasps)

17:26.959 --> 17:30.375
Ooh, there's biscuits
with sausage gravy.

17:30.375 --> 17:33.166
Oh, my God!
(all laughing)

17:33.166 --> 17:35.208
(mockingly)
Oh, my God,
I love you!

17:35.208 --> 17:37.625
Oh, hey, boo, um,
can you pay for this today?

17:37.625 --> 17:38.959
I left my card
at the bar last night.

17:38.959 --> 17:41.041
Yeah, boo, but I need you
to pay me back this time.

17:41.041 --> 17:42.959
Oh, hey, what'd you
get up to last night?

17:42.959 --> 17:45.792
I lost you after that
horse-faced girl fell down.

17:45.792 --> 17:47.333
I did my sex app.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.041
I told you to stop doing that.
I know.

17:49.041 --> 17:50.417
You're right, it's bad.

17:50.417 --> 17:51.875
Ugh.
Can I get you guys some drinks?

17:51.875 --> 17:54.875
Oh, yeah. I think we should
get some Bloody Marys.

17:54.875 --> 17:56.166
Oh, none for me. Thanks.

17:56.166 --> 17:57.667
'Cause I have reflux.

17:57.667 --> 18:00.375
But, um, can I just get,
like, the mix?

18:00.375 --> 18:03.291
So this thing on Friday
starts at 9:00,

18:03.291 --> 18:06.166
so I think we should,
you know, go out beforehand.

18:06.166 --> 18:07.667
Get some dranks,

18:07.667 --> 18:09.041
get there around 10:30.

18:09.041 --> 18:10.333
I'm gonna have to
meet you there

18:10.333 --> 18:11.959
because I am--

18:11.959 --> 18:13.583
I have to go
to my friend's play reading.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.166
Oh, God, that's awful.

18:15.166 --> 18:16.708
Not enough money
in the world.

18:16.708 --> 18:19.458
Truly. It's horrible.
Yeah, I'll see you
later after that.

18:19.458 --> 18:21.792
I can't-- Like...
I can't believe
I have to go to that.

18:21.792 --> 18:24.792
Hi, I'm Sebastian.
I'm an addict.
Group: Hi, Sebastian.

18:24.792 --> 18:27.792
My name is Marco
and I'm an addict.

18:27.792 --> 18:30.125
Hi, I'm Joel.
I'm an addict.

18:30.125 --> 18:33.166
She put all of these hopes on me

18:33.166 --> 18:35.834
and so what I did
to combat that

18:35.834 --> 18:39.500
was to be, a--
a fucked up whore.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.083
And, um...

18:42.083 --> 18:43.792
Lainey:
Oh, my God,
look at this family

18:43.792 --> 18:45.667
I saw on the way home
from work yesterday.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.875
Like, really, you guys?

18:46.875 --> 18:48.875
You're all in wheelchairs?

18:49.959 --> 18:52.500
You're a regular Vivian Maier.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.417
And then at one point,
he's like, very romantically,

18:55.417 --> 18:56.834
"Uh, I gotta take a shit."

18:56.834 --> 18:58.667
And I found myself going,

18:58.667 --> 19:00.291
"Why don't you just go
in the bed?"

19:00.291 --> 19:01.875
(all laugh)

19:01.875 --> 19:04.250
Ugh, I'm so hungry!

19:04.250 --> 19:07.041
Food! I want food!

19:07.041 --> 19:09.291
My name is Panda
and I wanna eat!

19:09.291 --> 19:11.500
Maxie! Hi!

19:11.500 --> 19:13.208
Oh, my God, Panda.
Feed me!

19:13.208 --> 19:14.542
Feed me, feed me!

19:14.542 --> 19:15.583
Panda, no.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
(chattering)

19:17.333 --> 19:20.333
We got it!
No, no, no, no.
Don't worry about it.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.000
Just that when
I post something,

19:22.000 --> 19:23.625
I really need
you to favorite it

19:23.625 --> 19:26.208
because otherwise,
I just get all in my head!

19:26.208 --> 19:28.166
Oh, boo, I'm so sorry.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.291
Sometimes I just get lazy
about that stuff.

19:30.291 --> 19:32.708
I-- I have to go
to the boys room.

19:32.708 --> 19:33.875
Do you have the coke?

19:35.375 --> 19:37.291
(toilet flushes)
I just want to say

19:37.291 --> 19:40.417
that if you're new,
um, we're so happy
to have you here

19:40.417 --> 19:44.834
because, um, you are
the lifeblood of this program.

19:44.834 --> 19:48.083
And, um, I'm so grateful

19:48.083 --> 19:51.083
that I'm sober
because if I wasn't sober,

19:51.083 --> 19:56.417
I would probably be, um...
(phone vibrating)

19:56.417 --> 19:58.000
(vibrating continues)

19:58.000 --> 19:59.792
Is someone's phone going off?

19:59.792 --> 20:02.083
I'm sorry, we--
Turn your phone off.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.917
Like, we don't have phones on.

20:03.917 --> 20:05.333
Totally lost
my train of thought.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.750
I think I'm just
gonna wrap there.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.083
Thanks for letting me share.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.375
Group:
Thanks, Jason.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.000
Did you talk to Max
about that job?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.792
No. God, thank you.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.458
Keep forgetting
to mention it.

20:15.458 --> 20:17.458
Listen, um, my friend Scott

20:17.458 --> 20:21.375
is a publicist
and he is hiring right now,

20:21.375 --> 20:22.792
and he has
amazing clients

20:22.792 --> 20:25.125
like the Met Ball
and shit like that.

20:25.125 --> 20:26.125
What?

20:26.125 --> 20:28.542
So, it would be
an entry-level thing,

20:28.542 --> 20:30.625
but I don't know,
would that ever interest you?

20:30.625 --> 20:31.792
Yes. I--
Yeah?

20:31.792 --> 20:34.625
I'm wasting away
in retail hell right now.
Perfect.

20:34.625 --> 20:37.291
Uh, I invited him to come
to dinner later after group,

20:37.291 --> 20:39.041
so I'll make it happen.

20:39.041 --> 20:40.500
Totally.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.625
I'm making White Russians.

20:42.625 --> 20:44.500
I don't want any. Thank you.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.291
Are you being good
and not doing carbs?

20:47.291 --> 20:49.625
Fucking hate you right now.

20:50.625 --> 20:55.000
Well, I am super bloated
and cramping.

20:56.166 --> 20:59.000
So, I don't give
a fuck about anything.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.125
Hey, will you braid
my hair tonight?

21:02.500 --> 21:04.125
I was actually
just about to leave.

21:04.125 --> 21:05.375
What? No!
I know.

21:05.375 --> 21:06.917
I'm sorry.
I just spent all week

21:06.917 --> 21:08.500
DVRing "Real Housewives."

21:08.500 --> 21:10.542
(chuckles)
Don't you just want to put on
elastic waist pants

21:10.542 --> 21:12.583
and be a fat garbage monster
on the couch with me?
Yes.

21:12.583 --> 21:16.041
So badly, but I told him
I'd go to this stupid
play reading thing.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.625
Another reading?
Who's this friend?

21:18.625 --> 21:20.041
This is fucking excessive.

21:20.041 --> 21:21.625
It's horrible.
Imagine how I feel.

21:21.625 --> 21:24.458
But I'll be done by midnight
and I can text you
when I'm on my way

21:24.458 --> 21:27.500
and you can let me know
what you want me to
bring you home.

21:27.500 --> 21:28.792
Okay.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.166
Have fun!
Okay!

21:32.625 --> 21:34.041
I love you!

21:34.041 --> 21:35.250
(door closes)

21:39.583 --> 21:41.041
Uh... nope.

21:44.333 --> 21:47.542
Um...

21:47.542 --> 21:48.917
Shit.

22:10.583 --> 22:11.834
(grunts)

22:19.041 --> 22:20.417
Hey!

22:21.708 --> 22:23.417
What are you doing?

22:23.417 --> 22:25.166
Locking my bike.

22:25.166 --> 22:27.417
It's a memorial.
Yeah, I know,

22:27.417 --> 22:29.959
but there's
nowhere else to lock up.
I'll be five minutes.

22:29.959 --> 22:32.583
Still. It's disrespectful.

22:33.583 --> 22:35.708
Well, I think in this case,

22:35.708 --> 22:37.542
the deceased
might have understood.

22:39.083 --> 22:40.917
I'm gonna be five minutes.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.625
Max:
Oh, God. Hi.

22:57.625 --> 23:00.667
Okay, I have been
coming to this chapter
for a few weeks now.

23:00.667 --> 23:02.083
Oh, sorry.
My name is Max.

23:02.083 --> 23:05.125
Um, and I haven't shared
before today.

23:05.125 --> 23:06.625
Oh, sorry,
and I'm an addict.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.208
Group: Hi, Max.
(chuckles)

23:08.208 --> 23:09.458
I forgot.

23:09.458 --> 23:13.500
Um, but I've been feeling
really uplifted by you guys.

23:13.500 --> 23:16.625
I don't know.
And I just, uh...

23:16.625 --> 23:18.792
I had a profound realization

23:18.792 --> 23:20.625
thanks to you,
and it's...

23:20.625 --> 23:24.375
it seems kind of obvious
and dumb, but I...

23:24.375 --> 23:26.959
I don't know.
Being around you fine people,

23:26.959 --> 23:30.125
I just-- It's brought
a lot to light for me, so...

23:32.000 --> 23:33.208
Okay.

23:33.208 --> 23:38.208
Crystal came into my life
junior year, Florida State.

23:38.208 --> 23:41.834
And I don't feel
like I've had a day
without crystal since then.

23:43.583 --> 23:46.333
It's like crystal has silently
taken over my life

23:46.333 --> 23:49.834
and I don't feel like
there's space for me
in it anymore.

23:51.250 --> 23:55.500
Like... crystal decides
everything for me.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.708
You know? Like...

23:57.708 --> 24:00.667
and I feel like
a fucking piece of shit

24:00.667 --> 24:02.250
just being controlled.

24:02.250 --> 24:06.125
I'm-- I'm fucking
in her control.

24:06.125 --> 24:09.291
Like, crystal doesn't care
what I want.

24:09.291 --> 24:11.667
Uh, crystal just cares
about crystal.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.625
Mm-hmm. That's true. Yeah.

24:13.625 --> 24:16.041
Yeah.
Yeah.

24:16.041 --> 24:18.792
And yet, sometimes I think
I want to be crystal,

24:18.792 --> 24:20.208
and those are
my darkest days

24:20.208 --> 24:23.458
because I'm-- I'm spending
all my fucking time

24:23.458 --> 24:25.708
and energy being
a gay clown for crystal.

24:25.708 --> 24:28.875
And why? It--
Like, crystal won't pay me back

24:28.875 --> 24:30.417
the fucking money
I've spent on her.

24:30.417 --> 24:34.291
Crystal won't be there for me
when I'm spending my birthday

24:34.291 --> 24:37.583
wondering if this is the day
my mom's gonna call me.

24:40.208 --> 24:44.083
Crystal demands
all the attention.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.041
Crystal demands
all the attention

24:47.041 --> 24:50.959
and she won't be satisfied
until I'm completely drained

24:50.959 --> 24:54.250
of life force,
of everything.

24:54.250 --> 24:55.875
And she's very racist.

24:55.875 --> 24:59.542
He's never even tried
crystal meth, you guys!

24:59.542 --> 25:01.542
Cute monologue though.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.166
Is this your little
play reading?

25:03.166 --> 25:04.667
This is a closed meeting.

25:04.667 --> 25:06.083
Settle down, Cherry Jones.

25:06.083 --> 25:08.083
Sebastian: You need to leave.
Do you know her? This woman?

25:08.083 --> 25:09.917
Lainey: Okay,
Neil Patrick Harris!
Jason: Wow.

25:09.917 --> 25:10.875
Get out.

25:10.875 --> 25:12.458
♪ ♪

25:22.500 --> 25:24.041
Oh!
Watch out!

25:25.125 --> 25:26.125
Dammit, man!

25:26.125 --> 25:28.667
You watch it.
No bike lane.
Come on!

25:28.667 --> 25:31.750
(phone chirps)

25:40.750 --> 25:42.542
Hello?

25:42.542 --> 25:45.250
Max: Hey, so I know you said
I shouldn't call you or whatever
or I shouldn't call you back

25:45.250 --> 25:48.083
or anything, but I did
something really stupid
and I really need to meet up

25:48.083 --> 25:50.667
and chill out
with your stuff, man.
It's like totally an emergency!

25:50.667 --> 25:52.917
I just found this phone
on the street.
You what?

25:52.917 --> 25:55.125
I'm the delivery driver.
I just found this phone.

25:55.125 --> 25:57.625
That's my friend's phone!
I'll take it for him.

25:57.625 --> 26:00.125
I'm seeing him tomorrow anyway.
Let's meet up! Where are you?

26:00.125 --> 26:01.708
Thank you so much!
I have cash!

26:01.708 --> 26:03.291
Is it?
Phone says "Asshole."

26:03.291 --> 26:05.959
Really? Oh!
That's a high school nickname.

26:05.959 --> 26:07.750
We're friends forever.
Always will be friends.

26:07.750 --> 26:10.417
But where are you?
Like I said, I have cash.
How much?

26:10.417 --> 26:12.083
(club music playing)

26:14.542 --> 26:17.291
Excellent song choice!
Yeah, boy!

26:20.458 --> 26:21.959
Do you sleep back there?

26:21.959 --> 26:24.250
Yeah. There's a futon
in the dressing room.

26:24.250 --> 26:27.125
This is very on point
for you, man.
Yeah, I love it.

26:27.125 --> 26:29.125
The only trouble is
there's no shower

26:29.125 --> 26:30.333
'cause it's a theater.

26:30.333 --> 26:33.500
But, um, there's
a cheap gym around the corner.

26:33.500 --> 26:34.875
So, I do that.

26:34.875 --> 26:37.208
Very, very Chad.
Yeah.

26:37.208 --> 26:38.291
It's awesome.

26:38.291 --> 26:41.166
Wait, are you saying "Chad"
in a pejorative sense?

26:41.166 --> 26:42.875
I think so.

26:43.792 --> 26:45.000
You--
Ye-oww!

26:45.000 --> 26:46.875
All right, man.
Please? I need a phone.

26:46.875 --> 26:48.333
Can I just get
a phone please?

26:48.333 --> 26:50.166
Shane? Shane?
Shane: Yeah?

26:50.166 --> 26:52.583
Wh-- where's the rest
of your battleship?
I don't know!

26:52.583 --> 26:55.208
You're really--
You're up to 11 over here.

26:55.208 --> 26:56.708
All right?
Good!

26:56.708 --> 26:59.417
There's so much to do.
(phone chirps)

26:59.417 --> 27:03.250
Hello, how may
I help you this evening?
How may I help you this evening?

27:03.250 --> 27:05.792
Max: Thank you for calling.
What? Hello?

27:05.792 --> 27:07.333
What location can
I find you at tonight

27:07.333 --> 27:09.625
where I can assist you
with your weed?
Uh...

27:09.625 --> 27:11.708
Who is this?
This is my phone.

27:11.708 --> 27:13.125
Hello, Congresswoman.

27:13.125 --> 27:15.125
I've been waiting
for this moment.

27:15.125 --> 27:17.625
The person who found your phone,

27:17.625 --> 27:19.458
a man,
entrusted me.

27:19.458 --> 27:21.375
He t-- and told me
to give you your phone,

27:21.375 --> 27:24.542
which I will do,
but it's going to cost you.

27:24.542 --> 27:27.041
(chuckles)
You're gonna come meet me

27:27.041 --> 27:30.041
with a Prada Inside bag, okay?

27:30.041 --> 27:32.875
Full of cash
and whatever drugs you have.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.708
I don't know if you have
any drugs right now.

27:34.708 --> 27:36.375
You can meet me here
or I can meet you there

27:36.375 --> 27:38.375
'cause there's Uber
on my phone.
What the fuck?

27:38.375 --> 27:39.750
What are you doing
with my phone, man?

27:39.750 --> 27:41.708
Calm down for a second!
What?

27:41.708 --> 27:43.583
If you just be quiet,
I can tell you!

27:43.583 --> 27:45.250
I know this guy.
He fucking sucks.

27:45.250 --> 27:46.750
People have been
calling you all night,

27:46.750 --> 27:48.625
so I know you're making
crazy money!

27:48.625 --> 27:51.583
Show me the money!
That's hilarious
because my first real blowjob

27:51.583 --> 27:53.166
was in eighth grade
from Corey Jacobson

27:53.166 --> 27:55.166
while "Jerry Maguire" was
playing on VHS!

27:55.166 --> 27:57.208
I'll give you
a blowjob right now!

27:57.208 --> 27:58.500
Okay! Sounds great!

27:58.500 --> 28:00.208
What did I tell you?
More money? More...

28:00.208 --> 28:02.333
Max: Now...
Shut up.

28:02.333 --> 28:04.041
where are we gonna
have our meet?

28:04.041 --> 28:05.417
Meet?
What do you mean meet?

28:05.417 --> 28:07.542
Our little tête-à-tête.

28:07.542 --> 28:10.125
Our little pas de deux.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.375
That's not gonna happen, man.

28:11.375 --> 28:13.000
I'm just gonna
erase this phone.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.750
Oh no! Oh no!
Yeah.

28:14.750 --> 28:16.417
He's like Mr. Robot
or some shit!

28:16.417 --> 28:17.583
He's erasing the phone!

28:17.583 --> 28:18.917
Pretty sad.

28:18.917 --> 28:21.000
But will you still come
sell us weed?
Hey, man, get help.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.125
Dude!

28:23.250 --> 28:25.041
Damn.
I'm sorry, man. That sucks.

28:25.041 --> 28:26.333
Well, thank you for that.

28:26.333 --> 28:28.333
It's impressive you can just
erase your burner like that.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.166
It's not a burner.
It's an iPhone.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.750
Uh, where do I put this?

28:31.750 --> 28:33.083
Meh. Wherever.

28:33.083 --> 28:34.625
All right.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.166
There you go.

28:37.792 --> 28:39.250
Well, thank you
very much, Chad.

28:39.250 --> 28:40.375
Yeah. Any time, man.

28:40.375 --> 28:43.083
Doors open, except
twice on Saturdays

28:43.083 --> 28:45.000
and every night
at 7:00.
Cool.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.917
You okay?

28:46.917 --> 28:48.333
Yeah. I'm great.

28:48.333 --> 28:49.625
You sure?

28:51.375 --> 28:52.959
Wanna use my shower?

28:52.959 --> 28:54.083
I'd like that.

28:54.083 --> 28:55.083
All right. Come on, man.

28:55.083 --> 28:57.250
You gonna turn off the light?
No.

28:57.250 --> 28:58.959
I don't know how.

28:58.959 --> 29:00.834
Tabs:
That's crazy!
Did you call his parents?

29:00.834 --> 29:02.625
Lainey:
No. I don't have
his parents' numbers.

29:02.625 --> 29:05.834
Oh, God, leave it to Max
to be such a drama queen
about this.

29:05.834 --> 29:07.542
Two days is a long time.
Oh, hang on, Tabs.

29:07.542 --> 29:09.792
He's coming.
I'll call you back.
Oh, okay.

29:09.792 --> 29:11.208
Max!
Hi, Lainey.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.959
Jesus Christ!
Where have you been?

29:12.959 --> 29:15.834
Hi, Lainey! Hi!
I was getting ready to tweet
about your disappearance!

29:15.834 --> 29:17.041
How am I supposed to know?

29:17.041 --> 29:19.208
No, because, you know,
he told me it was my birthday.

29:19.208 --> 29:21.708
I don't know. Well, argh!
I don't know what to do.

29:21.708 --> 29:22.959
I did it, Lainey.
I did meth.

29:22.959 --> 29:24.250
You know how
I'd never done it before

29:24.250 --> 29:26.500
and I was being a fraud?
I knew it. Now they all know.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.500
They all know I'm a fraud

29:27.500 --> 29:29.041
and I will never go
to the Met ball!

29:29.041 --> 29:31.708
Okay.
I would've put you on
the list, you fucking bitch!

29:31.708 --> 29:35.000
I don't know!
There's no vegetation in here.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.834
It's not something
that we do,

29:36.834 --> 29:38.500
and if you don't have
green in the kitchen,

29:38.500 --> 29:39.750
what are you supposed to do?

29:39.750 --> 29:43.083
I fucked Shane.
Party and play. Party and play!

29:43.083 --> 29:44.625
Party and play, y'all!

29:44.625 --> 29:47.166
We met on my phone
and we did meth,
and it's fun.

29:47.166 --> 29:48.708
We've been just fucking
for days I think.

29:48.708 --> 29:50.750
For a year!
Happy New Year, baby!

29:50.750 --> 29:52.792
What's up?

29:52.792 --> 29:55.375
Shane's mom's name is Anita,
and Anita has lupus.

29:55.375 --> 29:57.542
Lainey, is everybody named Shane
a quarter Cherokee

29:57.542 --> 29:59.542
with a lupus mom?
'Cause I think that's a thing.

29:59.542 --> 30:02.708
But now I can be friends
with Belle and Sebastian.

30:02.708 --> 30:04.375
I mean, Joel and Sebastian,

30:04.375 --> 30:05.834
because I know
what their lives are like

30:05.834 --> 30:08.083
and I-- I just know.
I just know

30:08.083 --> 30:09.708
because I already
am living that

30:09.708 --> 30:11.708
and I--
I'm all the things

30:11.708 --> 30:13.834
and I'm taking things
to the top!

30:16.750 --> 30:19.708

(singing)
Oh, my God, Max!

30:21.208 --> 30:23.375
You're gonna die
when you see this!

30:23.375 --> 30:24.834
Look at your little butt!

30:31.917 --> 30:34.000
You'd still be
wearing bootcut jeans

30:34.000 --> 30:35.375

And she's pissed
because her daughter got
the same face as her,

30:48.500 --> 30:50.625
only I don't think
she really realizes it,

30:50.625 --> 30:52.583
but on some level,
she knows.

30:52.583 --> 30:55.083
She's really
resentful about it.

30:57.041 --> 30:59.250
Maybe I'll get that face too.

31:00.291 --> 31:02.458
(gasps)
Oh, my God! Max!

31:02.458 --> 31:04.083
(chuckles lowly)
That was funny.

31:04.083 --> 31:05.959
You're doing so good today.

31:07.125 --> 31:09.041
Is it time for another?

Hit me.

31:22.250 --> 31:24.333
Why didn't the doctor
give me pills?

31:24.333 --> 31:27.959
'Cause you were on meth,
you fuck-tard.

31:28.959 --> 31:30.166
How'd he know?

31:30.166 --> 31:32.625
Well, first of all, you were
acting, like, totally insane.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.625
I also showed him the video.

31:34.625 --> 31:36.708
Oh, my God,
hey, oh, my God,
people have lupus!

31:36.708 --> 31:38.542
Isn't that a thing?
It's a thing! It's a thing!

31:38.542 --> 31:39.792
Ha ha, lupus.

31:39.792 --> 31:41.875
(chuckles lowly)
Mm.

31:41.875 --> 31:43.500
And can we talk
about how lucky you are

31:43.500 --> 31:45.959

31:49.208 --> 31:50.125
Mm.
