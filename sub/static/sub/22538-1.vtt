WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:13.050
I never said that, Maya.
I never once said that.

00:13.060 --> 00:15.080
Uh, yeah, you kinda did, Sam.

00:15.090 --> 00:16.760
When? When--when
did i say that?

00:16.770 --> 00:21.380
You said, and I quote, "Maya, I think it's
time-- I think it's time I met the folks."

00:21.400 --> 00:22.110
Was I drunk?

00:22.120 --> 00:23.960
No , you weren't drunk.

00:23.970 --> 00:26.460
Horny, maybe, but not drunk.

00:31.110 --> 00:32.270
I just...

00:32.290 --> 00:35.710
you know, meetin' the folks when the rest of
the department doesn't know yet, the boss...

00:35.730 --> 00:37.220
uh, news
flash, Sam--

00:37.240 --> 00:42.960
ma, stepdad, they don't hang out with the boss and
the rest of the detectives down at the old 1-2-5.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.200
I just think we need to...
proceed with caution. All right?

00:51.400 --> 00:53.790
- Yes. All right.
- That's all.

00:55.000 --> 00:55.999
Hey!

00:58.050 --> 01:00.740
I'm crazy about you, maya.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.410
I just...

01:04.690 --> 01:07.610
I just... it's-- can we
talk about this later?

01:07.620 --> 01:09.240
Sure.

01:13.111 --> 01:15.999
He is a homicide suspect, he is dangerous,
Becareful, All right!

01:17.890 --> 01:19.220
What's the status inside, boss?

01:19.240 --> 01:21.450
Raimes is alone, fourth floor apartment.

01:21.460 --> 01:23.300
You know if Raimes is
a possible track star?

01:23.320 --> 01:25.720
I figure not. Serial
killers usually aren't.

01:25.730 --> 01:28.590
Good, 'cause I'm all out of fight.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.600
- Ready, clams?
- Ready.

01:36.050 --> 01:37.110
N.Y.P.D.!

01:37.130 --> 01:39.270
Go ahead. Check the window.

01:39.280 --> 01:40.610
Track star!

01:40.620 --> 01:42.380
- All units...The suspect is in the wind.
- raimes!

01:42.390 --> 01:46.190
- Stop!
-He's gone out the back. He's gone out the back.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.690
Move!

01:53.150 --> 01:56.100
suspect is out the window. I'm on it.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.870
cut him off!

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074

02:13.900 --> 02:16.150
get out of the way!

02:16.540 --> 02:18.140
hold it!

02:23.110 --> 02:25.690
- smash his face in!
- I'm trying.

02:25.700 --> 02:29.410
- Ain't talking to you. Kill the pig, freak show.
- What?

02:30.020 --> 02:31.900
take him down, man!

02:35.160 --> 02:41.360
Colin Raimes, you're under arrest for the
abduction and murder of Laurie Stewart.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.590
Laurie Stewart--
kidnapped may 5th.

02:47.600 --> 02:53.550
No sexual assault, held for 30 hours
and strangled to death with a bootlace.

02:55.910 --> 02:59.250
We still haven't processed what this
fiber is we found under her fingernail.

02:59.260 --> 03:01.370
You wanna tell us, colin?

03:01.380 --> 03:06.410
Colin, this is your
diary found in your room.

03:07.190 --> 03:09.820
"I killed her.I left her
shirt for them to find,

03:09.830 --> 03:12.940
"held her for 30 hours, "just
the same way. She's been killed.

03:12.950 --> 03:17.060
"I enjoyed killing her. It
was more fun than marbles."

03:17.740 --> 03:20.300
Marbles? What are you, 9?

03:20.620 --> 03:22.910
I like Marbles.

03:22.920 --> 03:27.280
What was the exact time of
the abduction on may 5th?

03:27.310 --> 03:29.120
Approximately 2300 hours.

03:29.130 --> 03:31.210
- 11:00 P.M.?
- Yeah.

03:32.990 --> 03:37.690
These are the security tapes for the
stardrift casino in Atlantic city,

03:37.720 --> 03:40.150
time-stamped may 5th.

03:40.170 --> 03:45.670
If we were to fast-forward, you would see
mr. Raimes played craps all night long.

03:46.090 --> 03:48.350
I think we're done here.

03:51.330 --> 03:55.240
check with the stardrift, make sure
the time stamp hasn't been tampered.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.360
- yeah?
- It's me.

04:08.370 --> 04:12.090
I'm in east river park, and
I got Raimes in my crosshairs.

04:12.110 --> 04:13.440
Raimes is out?

04:13.450 --> 04:15.440
Why are you doing this, Maya?

04:15.460 --> 04:17.390
Well, I keep going back to the diary.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.959
"I held her for 30
hours, just the same way."

04:19.990 --> 04:24.130
It's like he's trying to impress
someone, copying something or someone.

04:24.150 --> 04:25.760
I feel like I've missed something.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.170
You don't have to prove anything to me.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.160
Don't I?

04:28.190 --> 04:31.620
I'm a cop first and foremost, sam,
and you made things real clear earlier.

04:31.660 --> 04:35.040
Earlier? No,
no, no. I was--

04:37.760 --> 04:40.460
you're not gonna believe this, Sam.

04:41.550 --> 04:42.800
Who's Lawrence Raimes?

04:42.810 --> 04:45.740
Lawrence Raimes is Colin twin brother.

04:45.770 --> 04:51.440
They're not on speaking terms, but lawrence there is
a degenerate gambler with a real taste for the dice.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.350
- Maya!
- Maya!

05:06.130 --> 05:07.820
Maya!

05:09.590 --> 05:11.400
Detective!

05:11.470 --> 05:14.060
We got two more units
coming in if you need it.

05:14.460 --> 05:16.730
nothing over here!

05:29.450 --> 05:32.560
what the hell was she doing here, Sam?

05:40.800 --> 05:45.170
10-13 of units, respond at 320
Madison-- Colin Raimes' residence.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.530
hold on, baby. I'm coming.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.040
Detective Tyler, this
is dispatch 50-20.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.800
Detective Tyler, please respond.

06:14.590 --> 06:16.450
go for Tyler.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.460
you can't park here.

07:32.470 --> 07:35.210
Uh,
I--yes.

07:35.220 --> 07:37.940
This--this
is not my car.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.690
so you ain't Sam Tyler?

07:42.420 --> 07:44.360
You--I-I
am.

07:44.370 --> 07:47.760
I--th-this--this--
this is not my car.

07:47.770 --> 07:51.090
I-I was driving A... a jeep.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.860
You were driving a military vehicle?

07:54.890 --> 07:56.020
I need my cell.

07:56.030 --> 07:57.400
You need to sell what?

07:57.410 --> 08:00.100
No. I just...

08:07.730 --> 08:09.180
no way.

small forward Phil Jackson helping out the
knicks in this game 3 against wilt chamberlain

09:00.140 --> 09:01.950
and the Los Angeles Lakers.

09:01.960 --> 09:05.280
What a game we have in
store for you tonight.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.680
you okay? Look like you seen a ghost.

09:59.690 --> 10:02.110
Like he's seen a ghost, and
he was ballin' your mother.

10:03.610 --> 10:05.770
you the, uh, transfer from Hyde?

10:05.780 --> 10:07.130
Sam Tyler?

10:07.140 --> 10:09.340
I'm Sam Tyler. What's Hyde?

10:09.350 --> 10:11.630
It's, uh, upstate.

10:11.650 --> 10:13.840
They got a great train museum up there.

10:13.860 --> 10:15.770
You ever been to it?

10:16.690 --> 10:18.000
All right.

10:18.010 --> 10:23.860
I don't know who the hell you think
you are, but this is my office...

10:25.270 --> 10:26.700
right here.

10:26.730 --> 10:30.580
This is my desk, here.

10:30.980 --> 10:33.250
So where's my desk?

10:34.350 --> 10:37.810
Where's my desk? Chair!

10:38.920 --> 10:42.200
- My computer!
- Your computer? Like hal?

10:42.210 --> 10:44.230
"2001: A space odyssey"?

10:44.240 --> 10:46.410
looks like we got us a regular spaceman.

10:46.420 --> 10:47.820
Okay, what the hell's going on?

10:47.830 --> 10:49.210
This is my department.

10:49.220 --> 10:50.320
What have you done with it?

10:50.330 --> 10:52.950
Hey, hey, you might
wanna keep it down, boss.

10:54.450 --> 10:56.430
too late.

10:56.440 --> 10:59.730
- Now you done it.
- You woke him.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.660
all right. Okay.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.280
Surprise me.

11:22.290 --> 11:25.910
What year is this supposed to be?

11:28.390 --> 11:29.810
it's 1973.

11:29.820 --> 11:34.390
Or, as our chinese brethren would
like to call it, the year of the fist.

11:35.310 --> 11:37.190
you gotta be kidding me.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.280
Don't ever waltz into my kingdom
acting the king of the jungle.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.220
operator.

12:10.230 --> 12:15.510
Um, yeah. I'm--I'm trying
to reach, uh, 917-555-0147.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.590
Is that an international number?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.310
No. No, it--it's
a cell phone.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.800
Maya Daniels' cell phone.

12:22.810 --> 12:26.130
I'm not sure what you're
selling, sir, but you're gonna--

12:26.270 --> 12:29.370
- doctor?
- we're losing him!

12:30.400 --> 12:32.690
- clear!
- clear!

12:33.740 --> 12:35.460
no response.

12:37.370 --> 12:39.430
- Clear!
- Clear!

12:43.690 --> 12:48.440
stop!

12:53.000 --> 12:57.780
clearly, detective Tyler here is dizzier
than a monkey on a merry-go-round.

12:58.290 --> 13:00.250
Have someone check under his hood.

13:00.270 --> 13:02.020
What, "no-nuts"?

13:02.030 --> 13:04.000
"No-nuts."

13:05.830 --> 13:08.770
No broken bones, no bruises.

13:08.780 --> 13:10.820
Do you feel like you're gonna vomit?

13:10.860 --> 13:13.870
I am a little nauseous,
to tell you the truth.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.980
But you would be, too, if you
took the last flight in from 2008.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.180
You're gonna stick that story, huh?

13:19.190 --> 13:20.330
Are you a doctor?

13:20.340 --> 13:23.590
Mm, I'm about as
qualified as Dr. Kildare.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.560
I'm part of the bureau of policewomen.

13:27.570 --> 13:28.940
What's that?

13:28.950 --> 13:31.350
Oh, they don't have
that in 2008, do they?

13:31.360 --> 13:33.030
Mm, not so much.

13:33.040 --> 13:39.030
We tend to lost kitties, hysterical
girlfriends, concussed detectives.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.050
What's your name?

13:40.060 --> 13:41.680
Annie Norris.

13:41.690 --> 13:44.540
Or as I am so fondly referred
to here in the old 1-2-5--

13:44.550 --> 13:46.910
"no-nuts" Norris.

13:47.940 --> 13:50.380
I was 4 in 1973.

13:50.390 --> 13:54.350
This is 1973, detective Tyler.

13:54.620 --> 13:57.800
And you really should stop
with that line of nonsense.

13:57.810 --> 13:59.300
If what you say is true...

13:59.320 --> 14:04.310
you were hit by a car, brain is a
little sozzled, but you seem okay.

14:04.330 --> 14:08.640
This notion that you're some kind
of a time traveler, not withstanding.

14:10.860 --> 14:14.630
Annie, get your "talking
to grieving parents" kit on.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.360
We found the missing twirl.

14:16.370 --> 14:17.580
A-a "twirl"?

14:17.590 --> 14:18.670
A girl.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.940
A broad? A chick? A dame? A lass?

14:20.950 --> 14:23.540
Of course.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.520
A twirl.

14:25.530 --> 14:28.040
Her name's Suzi Tripper,
missing two days.

14:28.050 --> 14:30.840
Her blouse was left in east river park.

14:30.850 --> 14:33.440
East river park?That--that's
where Maya--

14:33.450 --> 14:36.900
found her this morning, neck
wrung like a christmas turkey.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.590
No sign of sexual assault.

14:38.610 --> 14:43.070
Her blouse left at the scene of abduction,
strangled, no sign of sexual assault.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.610
Is--is this
why I'm here?

14:44.630 --> 14:50.660
No, you're here to make me curse the day my father's
sperm asked my mama's egg if it could have this dance.

14:51.410 --> 14:52.950
Where's the body?

14:52.970 --> 14:55.270
Take him to the slab.

14:55.730 --> 14:57.730
Lab lifted a few prints off her shoe.

14:57.740 --> 14:59.300
They've been sent downtown.

14:59.310 --> 15:02.390
Should hear back in a couple of
weeks or so if there's a match.

15:02.410 --> 15:03.470
A couple of weeks?

15:03.500 --> 15:06.940
Yeah. It's amazing what
they can do these days.

15:08.770 --> 15:12.190
strangled with a ligature, no other
wounds, defensive or otherwise.

15:12.210 --> 15:15.280
What have we learned
from the stomach contents?

15:15.860 --> 15:18.180
Um, Chris?

15:18.210 --> 15:20.410
Uh, take a look.

15:23.180 --> 15:26.620
In the file. In the... post-mortem file.

15:31.920 --> 15:35.930
well, um, she wasn't fed for at
least a day before she was killed.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.130
"Held her for 30 hours."

15:38.150 --> 15:40.900
Just like Laurie Stewart.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.730
come on!

15:47.150 --> 15:50.720
All right. Stop. over. Enough!

15:53.130 --> 15:57.470
Okay, wall is wet. I can
smell the... formaldehyde.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.550
Sandwich on the tray, half-eaten.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.570
It's ham.

16:02.580 --> 16:05.180
someone's-- someone's
whistling outside.

16:05.190 --> 16:08.340
To think, this is the guy they
wanna bump up instead of you?

16:08.360 --> 16:09.810
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.010
It's an embarrassment.

16:11.020 --> 16:12.590
Hey, you gotta get some rest.

16:12.610 --> 16:15.910
I-I think that that crash
maybe hurt your head.

16:18.960 --> 16:21.400
oh, my head.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.800
oh, my head.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.270
Hey, pal.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.230
Why don't you get yourself a scotch?

16:28.270 --> 16:30.020
Maybe even a stewardess.

16:30.050 --> 16:31.970
You know, set things right.

16:46.070 --> 16:47.800
What
are y--

16:52.160 --> 16:53.750
my god

17:04.630 --> 17:05.829
Tyler.

17:09.680 --> 17:13.030
you look like you were
sleeping with your eyes open.

17:14.619 --> 17:16.260
this is about Maya.

17:16.290 --> 17:17.500
About your "what-a"?

17:17.510 --> 17:21.690
He kills,and then he waits
35 years to strike again.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.160
I mean, that must be why I'm here.

17:24.190 --> 17:29.030
I mean--I mean,if--if I can stop him
now, he can't kill then, and Maya's safe.

17:29.770 --> 17:30.920
No.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.890
Colin Raimes would
be in diapers in 1973.

17:33.950 --> 17:35.310
It doesn't add up.

17:35.330 --> 17:37.230
No, it don'T.

17:37.660 --> 17:39.820
No-nuts is gonna take
you to your new flop.

17:39.860 --> 17:42.260
Take the rest of the day to get settled.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.790
- Yeah, but the fibers--
- that's an order.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.890
He's all yours.

17:48.490 --> 17:49.980
Come on, Sam.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.780
Let me take you home.

17:51.810 --> 17:53.080
"home"?

17:53.100 --> 17:54.390
Yeah.

17:54.450 --> 17:56.610
How can I argue with that?

18:25.310 --> 18:26.630
It's not that bad.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.510
The water isn't brown
so much as it's tan.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.280
Hey, at least the department
is putting you up.

18:35.290 --> 18:38.380
My wage still has me living
with my folks in Kew Gardens.

18:38.990 --> 18:41.970
I mean, Mike Farrell may biggest key
ring in town, but my key isn't on it.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Um, bathroom's down the hall.

18:45.200 --> 18:49.100
There's one on each floor, so you won't
be sharing it with the whole building.

18:51.890 --> 18:53.520
They shipped your clothes from Hyde.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.750
I unpacked them for you.

18:57.710 --> 19:00.250
Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.870
Annie?

19:04.830 --> 19:06.630
Listen to me.

19:08.460 --> 19:12.320
I had an accident,and I
woke up 35 years in the past.

19:12.340 --> 19:18.350
Now that either makes me a
time traveler, a-a lunatic...

19:18.380 --> 19:22.250
or I'm lying in a hospital bed
in 2008, and none of this is real.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.880
I thought we
agreed to stop--

19:23.910 --> 19:29.310
Maya, my girlfriend, has been kidnapped by the
same man who strangled Suzi Tripper yesterday...

19:29.320 --> 19:31.700
Maybe we should rethink
this trip to the hospital.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.580
And he'll hold her for a day.

19:33.620 --> 19:38.530
And then, like Laurie Stewart in 2008
and Suzi Tripper here in '73, and I...

19:39.360 --> 19:41.450
I can't help her.

19:42.220 --> 19:43.260
There's a thing, Sam.

19:43.310 --> 19:45.690
It's called paranoid delusion.

19:45.720 --> 19:50.880
It's chemical, it's in the brain,and--and
things like head wounds can bring it on.

19:50.890 --> 19:54.910
that's pretty fancy talk for a girl
who lives with her folks in Queens.

19:55.040 --> 19:59.800
Temporary arrangement for a woman who's still
paying off her psychology degree from Fordham.

19:59.810 --> 20:05.230
And what if you're just my
mind telling me this is real?

20:15.600 --> 20:17.430
You feel it?

20:18.260 --> 20:19.980
My heartbeat.

20:24.860 --> 20:30.680
If I were a figment of your imagination,I
would probably let your hand linger on my chest.

20:32.420 --> 20:33.310
However...

20:34.520 --> 20:35.630
I gotta go.

20:36.980 --> 20:37.960
Where?

20:38.630 --> 20:39.710
What do you care?

20:40.330 --> 20:41.850
I'm not real, remember?

20:41.890 --> 20:43.380
Soon as I walk out that door...

20:43.390 --> 20:44.260
poof!

20:44.270 --> 20:45.740
I'm gone.

20:45.780 --> 20:47.260
here I go.

20:47.270 --> 20:50.240
Hocus-pocus!

21:04.800 --> 21:06.520
magic, huh?

21:08.650 --> 21:11.110
now get some rest.

21:11.780 --> 21:16.520
In module 3, we noted that the collective
pythorean angles can be derived

21:16.560 --> 21:21.720
from the simple numinary
"a" as in the constant 10.

21:23.940 --> 21:28.990
What concerns us most is
regulating his breathing.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.660
I have to stress to you that
sam is in low responsiveness,

21:31.680 --> 21:35.090
but not in a persistent
vegetative state.

21:35.130 --> 21:38.240
Hey,I'm right here.

21:38.290 --> 21:41.960
There are times, however, he
moves, murmurs...

21:41.980 --> 21:42.900
I'm here!

21:42.920 --> 21:44.250
Has motor responses...

21:44.260 --> 21:45.380
yeah, you're damn right I do!

21:45.390 --> 21:50.190
- Suggesting perhaps that he is operating in an alternate reality.
- Look! Look at me!

21:50.200 --> 21:54.620
All we can do is
monitor and-- and wait.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.130
Sam!

21:59.790 --> 22:02.310
What? I'm awake. I'm awake.

22:02.330 --> 22:03.860
Look at me!

22:06.400 --> 22:07.460
Where you going?

22:07.470 --> 22:08.670
Don't leave me.

22:08.680 --> 22:09.750
Don't leave me here.

22:09.770 --> 22:10.740
Please!

22:10.770 --> 22:12.260
Don't go!

22:14.600 --> 22:16.150
no.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.700
don't leave me.

22:25.070 --> 22:26.760
Suzi Tripper's dead,

22:26.810 --> 22:30.080
and you were seen having a sloe gin
fizz with her the night she was murdered.

22:30.110 --> 22:31.000
I know you.

22:31.030 --> 22:35.390
You broke my cousin Davey's collarbone
at that war protest down on bank street.

22:35.410 --> 22:39.430
Or as I like to refer
to it, the good old days.

22:40.450 --> 22:41.150
Dora?

22:41.180 --> 22:45.920
Uh, my name's detective
Tyler, but please call me Sam.

22:45.940 --> 22:47.680
Are you really a cop?

22:47.710 --> 22:49.530
You don't seem like no cop.

22:49.550 --> 22:51.170
You ain't so much ugly.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.140
Thank you, Sophia Loren.

22:53.150 --> 22:54.760
That night, you were with Suzi.

22:54.780 --> 22:57.260
Did you see her, uh, talking with anyone?

22:57.270 --> 22:58.520
A stranger, perhaps?

22:58.540 --> 23:01.640
The answer, detective Tyler...

23:02.340 --> 23:03.720
is blowin' in the wind

23:03.730 --> 23:05.740
I'm done with this!

23:05.750 --> 23:06.730
Get your hands off me!

23:06.740 --> 23:07.640
Lieutenant!

23:07.650 --> 23:08.520
I want a lawyer!

23:08.530 --> 23:09.370
Stop it!

23:09.380 --> 23:10.250
She asked for a lawyer.

23:10.270 --> 23:11.360
You're done with this, Tyler.

23:11.370 --> 23:12.540
She's a possible witness.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.250
Get outta here!

23:14.250 --> 23:15.830
Sit down.

23:24.040 --> 23:26.060
how you doing, my friend?

23:26.300 --> 23:28.620
What part of my subconscious
do you hail from?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.340
Poughkeepsie.

23:30.780 --> 23:31.720
what's your poison?

23:31.730 --> 23:33.250
Just give me a diet coke.

23:33.260 --> 23:35.170
Diet coke?

23:35.390 --> 23:36.610
Uh, scotch.

23:36.630 --> 23:37.730
Make it a double, will you?

23:37.730 --> 23:38.300
Diet coke.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.410
Now that would be something, huh?

23:40.410 --> 23:40.970
Yeah.

23:40.990 --> 23:42.790
Irish coffee, Nelson,

23:42.810 --> 23:47.230
and I want it black as the sky on
a moonless night above 110th street.

23:47.670 --> 23:48.330
Hey, blue.

23:48.340 --> 23:49.770
This is the detectives' joint.

23:49.790 --> 23:51.860
Your gin mill's around the corner.

23:52.410 --> 23:53.120
All right, let's go.

23:53.130 --> 23:54.670
What did you do to that girl?

23:54.680 --> 23:56.880
You know, where I come from, you'd
be looking at suspension.

23:56.910 --> 23:57.880
really?

23:57.900 --> 23:59.820
For making a breakthrough?

23:59.880 --> 24:02.940
At 2300 hours, she saw Suzi
Tripper heading away from the bar,

24:02.950 --> 24:05.570
followed by a white
male with long dark hair.

24:05.590 --> 24:07.390
That's what I call...

24:07.410 --> 24:08.580
narrowing the gap.

24:08.610 --> 24:11.280
Listen, it's not human
hair under the fingernails.

24:11.290 --> 24:12.440
It's synthetic.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.800
The killer's either wearing thick gloves

24:13.810 --> 24:16.670
or he's using a bag or something
made of coarse materials.

24:16.690 --> 24:19.780
That's a long road of logic to pull
from one minute in the meat-house.

24:19.810 --> 24:20.780
I've seen it before.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.060
I'm telling you, there's a pattern here.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.940
He's gonna take another girl.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.220
you don't have to listen to me.

24:30.250 --> 24:33.680
After all, you're just
some bottom-feeding thug

24:33.700 --> 24:37.570
who crawled out of some dark
pit in the recesses of my mind.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.760
I'll see you, gene.

24:38.790 --> 24:40.820
Send regards to my id.

24:43.610 --> 24:45.150
You wanna throw down?

24:45.850 --> 24:47.930
Let's throw down right now.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.640
You're new on the spit, Tyler, and
I sympathize with that--

24:51.660 --> 24:55.020
"first day at new
school" jitters and all.

24:56.020 --> 24:59.080
But here's what you need
to get smart on quick--

24:59.330 --> 25:01.040
my team's tight.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.440
We collar the baddies
to keep this island safe.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.940
I never give up, and I
always go for the maximum.

25:05.970 --> 25:11.430
When my time is done,they will say,"he
has been here," of that I am sure.

25:11.450 --> 25:16.220
"He...has...been...here."

25:16.240 --> 25:19.360
And there are less villains on
the street because of that fact.

25:19.370 --> 25:22.560
Which is why you need to believe me.

25:22.770 --> 25:27.300
With what I know, I can find this killer.

25:29.380 --> 25:31.340
All right, then.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.060
Prove it.

25:33.820 --> 25:36.560
To find our guy, we have to
anticipate his next move.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.750
To do that, we have to get inside his
head to understand what he's thinking.

25:39.790 --> 25:41.800
It's a very powerful
thing to be able to do.

25:41.830 --> 25:45.000
So is pulling a rabbit
out of my labonza.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.140
Annie?

25:49.160 --> 25:51.390
You're familiar with the case?

25:51.400 --> 25:52.880
Yes, sir.

25:52.900 --> 25:54.940
Can you help me out here?

25:56.530 --> 25:58.810
I'd rather not.

25:58.820 --> 25:59.690
Please.

25:59.690 --> 26:01.490
Come on, Annie.

26:03.780 --> 26:04.810
Oh, I get it.

26:04.820 --> 26:07.890
Every houdini needs an assistant
with a great set of gams.

26:07.910 --> 26:09.820
Ms. Norris has a psych
degree from Fordham.

26:09.840 --> 26:12.040
Yeah, well, I have an ass
that can fart the melody

26:12.060 --> 26:14.550
of every Peter, Paul and
Mary song ever recorded.

26:14.570 --> 26:17.330
Do I get to stand up there, too?

26:18.210 --> 26:21.730
so...e victim wasn't gagged.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.660
That seems odd.

26:23.960 --> 26:24.760
Right?

26:24.770 --> 26:26.640
Why didn't he gag her?

26:26.970 --> 26:29.680
Because he needed...

26:30.360 --> 26:34.770
he needed to see her mouth, her lips.

26:34.770 --> 26:37.640
We need to see the things that we value.

26:37.660 --> 26:40.680
Put yourself in his
mind-set-- you're lonely.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.740
Women ignore you.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.710
But in your dreams, there's a girl.

26:43.740 --> 26:46.240
She's got these big eyes and...

26:46.260 --> 26:48.330
ruby red lips.

26:48.480 --> 26:51.570
And this dream haunts you.

26:51.590 --> 26:55.140
But one day, you find that girl from
your dreams, and you bring her home.

26:55.170 --> 26:56.930
But something's wrong.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.440
Why don't those lips smile at
you like they did in the dream?

26:59.480 --> 27:01.670
So you're embarrassed.

27:01.940 --> 27:03.030
Then angry.

27:03.050 --> 27:03.880
It's her fault.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.840
She taunted you in
the dream, and now--

27:05.870 --> 27:07.060
now she's rejecting you.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.570
You reach your breaking point.

27:08.590 --> 27:12.930
You strangle her, and the whole cycle
repeats itself with another girl,

27:12.960 --> 27:15.620
but this time, you're sure you'll
must the courage to kiss her.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.800
Only you won't
be able to--

27:19.110 --> 27:20.410
if I wanted to be this bored,

27:20.420 --> 27:22.730
I'd go to mass with the missus
and her miserable mother.

27:22.790 --> 27:24.630
This nut job may have
just moved into the area.

27:24.660 --> 27:27.640
Let's start lookin' at new
faces in the local boozers.

27:27.660 --> 27:31.710
Let's not wait until another
girl ends up with her dead on.

27:31.730 --> 27:32.970
Get outta here, Norris.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.350
Somewhere there's bound to be someone
lookin' for their cream of wheat.

27:36.370 --> 27:38.390
we've wasted enough time already.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.900
Let's go.

27:41.290 --> 27:42.790
Sam!

27:44.720 --> 27:46.370
About back there...

27:47.360 --> 27:49.600
please don't ever do that to me again.

27:49.610 --> 27:52.860
What, ask you to use your
brain for five seconds?

27:53.220 --> 27:57.880
I know how this department works, and I
know what they think about women in uniform.

27:57.900 --> 28:00.890
And someday things are going
to change, but until that day,

28:00.920 --> 28:04.430
the last thing I need is to draw
attention to the things I know,

28:04.460 --> 28:08.600
the things that are going to make me an excellent
member of the New York police department.

28:08.620 --> 28:09.860
That day is not now,

28:09.890 --> 28:14.300
and no matter how much you believe you
came from a future where this is all so,

28:14.340 --> 28:16.080
it's not.

28:16.470 --> 28:18.260
I don't understand.

28:18.270 --> 28:20.120
I'm sorry. I'm
not trying--

28:20.140 --> 28:23.970
I don't understand why I
would be dreaming about this.

28:24.000 --> 28:30.300
Who dreams of being yelled at by a closet
feminist member of the 1973 policewomen's bureau?

28:31.490 --> 28:32.940
Where are you going?

28:33.530 --> 28:35.720
My mind can only invent so much.

28:35.730 --> 28:44.750
So I'm gonna walk until I can't think up any
more streets or faces or arguments or details.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.580
There are only so many details.

29:13.240 --> 29:16.980
what I need to do, Annie, is to
follow the yellow brick road.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.750
And what are you gonna find?

29:18.770 --> 29:22.950
Hopefully, the end of
the yellow brick road--

29:22.970 --> 29:27.280
Maya is saved, and I get to go home.

29:42.060 --> 29:44.250
My mom used to take me here.

29:44.260 --> 29:50.480
I bought my first Hall & Oates alb---
uh, my--my first Led Zeppelin album here.

29:51.610 --> 29:55.980
What you see here-- all of this--
Vinyl albums--they all become obsolete,

29:55.990 --> 30:01.800
replaced with, uh, cds and digital music
you listen to on mp3 players this big.

30:01.810 --> 30:03.670
And the sound is, um...

30:03.670 --> 30:05.370
well, it's much worse.

30:07.410 --> 30:10.510
I'll have to find a way to
take all this back with me.

30:16.560 --> 30:17.840
Sam?

30:23.670 --> 30:24.400
he doesn't gag them.

30:24.430 --> 30:26.740
He wants to kiss them, so he
doesn't cover their mouths.

30:26.770 --> 30:27.890
But if they shout, he could get caught.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.020
So how does he keep 'em qut?

30:30.050 --> 30:34.410
Strands of material under the victim's
nails and on their skin, only it's not wool.

30:34.430 --> 30:35.620
It'S...

30:35.630 --> 30:37.940
it'S...coarse.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.350
Synthetic.

30:39.370 --> 30:40.720
Know what this is, Annie?

30:40.730 --> 30:42.450
What?

30:42.460 --> 30:44.920
It's the end of the yellow brick road.

30:48.110 --> 30:52.540
The fibers we found under
Suzi Tripper's fingernails?

30:52.550 --> 30:54.410
Acoustic padding.

30:54.610 --> 30:56.850
That's how he keeps his victims quiet.

30:56.870 --> 31:00.490
He soundproofs the room
where he holds them.

31:02.550 --> 31:03.770
What's wrong?

31:03.780 --> 31:06.420
That pain in the ass Dora
Keene has gone missing.

31:06.430 --> 31:10.620
That found her jacket all ripped up and
bloodied on the "j" platform at Delancey.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.360
Looks like he did it again.

31:12.380 --> 31:13.660
I got something.

31:13.670 --> 31:15.830
Raimes--that name you
asked me to look into--

31:15.840 --> 31:18.870
there's a report filed three
months ago-- woman in her 70s.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.030
Shirley Raimes.

31:20.030 --> 31:21.810
Why is this Mrs.Raimes important?

31:21.820 --> 31:23.820
She's Colin Raimes' grandmother.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.680
Who the hell's Colin Raimes?

31:27.250 --> 31:29.870
Look, this is just a hunch, okay?

31:33.670 --> 31:35.280
Bring her in.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.480
that's good coffee.

31:42.510 --> 31:45.260
There's so much bad coffee in the world.

31:45.290 --> 31:48.160
It's nice to have good
coffee with a pastry.

31:48.200 --> 31:53.610
Mrs. Raimes, you made a complaint
to the police three months ago.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.920
I did?

31:56.930 --> 31:58.790
This is wonderful.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.950
Good. Now you made a
complaint about a neighbor.

32:01.970 --> 32:04.230
What can you tell us about that?

32:04.260 --> 32:05.200
I forget things.

32:05.220 --> 32:11.080
Mrs. Raimes, it could be vital that you remember
exactly why you came in to see us three months ago.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.980
I...

32:13.170 --> 32:16.900
okay. Maybe-- maybe someone upset you
or did something bad or--or dangerous.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.840
Now, come on , Mrs. Raimes, I
need you to think.

32:18.860 --> 32:19.480
Come on.

32:19.510 --> 32:21.000
think!

32:22.990 --> 32:25.100
Pasticiot'.

32:26.460 --> 32:27.410
What's that, hon?

32:27.420 --> 32:31.300
I love pasticiot', the ones
with the real italian custard.

32:31.300 --> 32:34.820
Oh, those are quite pricey.

32:34.830 --> 32:38.170
Chris, run down to Quinzani's
and pick up a dozen pasticiot'.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.300
Tell Richie Quinzani they're for
a very special friend of mine.

32:41.310 --> 32:44.820
And don't you go worrying
about this neighbor business.

32:45.740 --> 32:49.550
It's not important, not important at all.

32:49.580 --> 32:50.620
You want another cup, hon?

32:50.630 --> 32:52.490
That's very nice of you.

32:52.490 --> 32:53.900
You got it.

32:54.380 --> 32:56.600
The man downstairs--
Willy Kramer...

32:56.610 --> 32:57.620
what about him, dear?

32:57.630 --> 33:01.110
He plays his phonograph
all the night long.

33:01.130 --> 33:04.280
Bash, crash, bam--
terrible stuff.

33:04.300 --> 33:08.810
Music these days--oh, it's
not like the golden era.

33:08.840 --> 33:12.640
So that's why you came in to make
a complain about the noise from his stereo.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.600
And it did the trick.

33:14.670 --> 33:19.720
He still lives there, but
you can't hear a thing now.

33:37.420 --> 33:38.470
wait.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.040
Do we have a warrant?

33:41.820 --> 33:43.500
There's your warrant.

33:44.111 --> 33:44.888
-Police!
--Perfect

34:04.480 --> 34:06.090
Nora, it's ok

34:06.120 --> 34:07.310
Police!

34:07.330 --> 34:09.139
Nora, remember me?

34:09.170 --> 34:10.800
You're safe.

34:50.340 --> 34:51.520
Kramer?

34:53.080 --> 34:54.690
It's over.

34:55.969 --> 34:58.090
there's no place left to go.

35:11.790 --> 35:14.050
you got it right, pig.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.990
There's no place left to go.

35:22.850 --> 35:24.190
Will?

35:24.990 --> 35:26.120
Willy, listen to me.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.050
No.

35:27.060 --> 35:28.580
I'm not going anywhere with you.

35:28.590 --> 35:29.970
All right, just put the gun down.

35:29.990 --> 35:31.460
It's the way back.

35:31.490 --> 35:33.490
It's the only way back.

35:33.720 --> 35:35.390
The...

35:36.320 --> 35:37.570
the way back where?

35:37.600 --> 35:40.630
the way back home.

35:41.250 --> 35:43.830
- Willy--  
- stay away or I'll do it!

35:44.010 --> 35:46.130
I will do it.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.910
I get it now.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.550
Oh, that's good. That's right.

35:51.560 --> 35:54.400
Okay. Send me back.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.400
Shoot me, so I can save Maya.

35:56.410 --> 35:58.700
Shake me out of this insanity.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.100
the crack of the
gun, the bullet, it's the--

36:01.120 --> 36:02.620
it's the jolt I need. Is
that what you're saying?

36:02.640 --> 36:04.150
Don't make me!

36:04.160 --> 36:05.330
Why not?

36:05.330 --> 36:06.920
This is all in my mind anyway.

36:06.920 --> 36:10.020
You don't exist. You're just
a symbol of my anger or a--

36:10.040 --> 36:13.070
or a metaphor for my inability to commit.

36:13.070 --> 36:14.010
Either way, you're nothing.

36:14.030 --> 36:15.140
Please!

36:15.160 --> 36:15.820
You do it.

36:15.850 --> 36:17.270
Shoot me.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.070
Wake me up.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.050
Shoot me!

36:19.070 --> 36:21.140
Come on. Come on. Pull the trigger.

36:21.170 --> 36:21.910
I want to go back home.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.480
Come on. Pull the trigger, Willy.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.360
Get me outta here, Willy!

36:31.480 --> 36:33.980
You really are some
kindof lunatic, Tyler.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.160
You even managed to
out-lunatic this daffy goopus,

36:36.170 --> 36:40.290
and he's crazier than a fruit
bat at a cranberry convention...

36:42.160 --> 36:45.760
which makes you a pretty
good fit for us at the 1-2-5.

36:46.110 --> 36:47.630
What do you think, boss?

36:47.660 --> 36:49.180
That remains to be seen.

36:52.070 --> 36:53.280
Is that necessary?

36:53.320 --> 36:54.770
Not at all.

37:17.710 --> 37:22.280
Laurence, Colin, get inside, boys.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.890
I like. Marbles

37:49.490 --> 37:51.640
Maya was right. It
was about hero worship.

37:51.650 --> 37:56.150
Colin Raimes was trying to impress the man
he idolized-- his neighbor, Willy Kramer.

37:56.160 --> 37:56.880
It was a copycat.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.100
Sam.

37:58.110 --> 38:02.410
That little boy is
gonna grow up to abduct Maya.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.130
So what now, Sam?

38:07.150 --> 38:08.780
I don't know, Annie.

38:10.340 --> 38:12.190
I don't know.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.020
hey, Colin.

39:13.750 --> 39:16.740
you're the one who took away Willy.

39:19.360 --> 39:24.350
there are things I know...about you.

39:24.840 --> 39:28.620
And you may never
understand how I know them.

39:29.610 --> 39:33.990
You want to be...like Willy

39:34.040 --> 39:37.320
'cause you think he has the answers.

39:37.910 --> 39:39.890
Isn't that right?

39:39.900 --> 39:42.570
Willy isn't afraid of anything.

39:42.860 --> 39:45.550
I'm afraid of everything.

39:49.240 --> 39:52.030
It's good to be afraid, Colin.

39:54.490 --> 39:57.140
Fear keeps us honest.

39:59.670 --> 40:02.380
Fear keeps us alive.

40:11.030 --> 40:13.360
It keeps us sane.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.880
Keeps us sane.

40:19.220 --> 40:20.840
Sam?

40:21.740 --> 40:22.970
Maya?

40:23.010 --> 40:24.760
Sam, it's me.

40:25.140 --> 40:25.870
Can you hear me?

40:25.900 --> 40:27.600
Yes, I-I can hear you.

40:27.630 --> 40:28.410
Maya?

40:28.430 --> 40:32.250
Sam, if you can hear me, I'm safe.

40:32.270 --> 40:34.210
Everything's okay.

40:34.350 --> 40:35.910
Now come home.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.620
Come back home.

40:39.100 --> 40:40.050
but I don't know how.

40:40.090 --> 40:41.670
I miss you.

40:42.730 --> 40:45.160
I miss you, too.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.990
Are you okay, mister?

40:54.060 --> 40:55.300
yeah.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.860
Yeah. I, uh...

40:57.970 --> 40:59.660
she said she's safe.

40:59.690 --> 41:01.300
So...

41:04.550 --> 41:05.470
I guess I am.

41:05.480 --> 41:07.170
Sam?

41:07.810 --> 41:13.320
uh, yeah, uh, go for Tyler.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.030
Sam, I've been lookin' all over for you.

41:15.080 --> 41:16.990
We got an armed robbery down on Sullivan.

41:17.010 --> 41:18.680
The loo wants all hands on deck.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.290
Are you comin'?

41:20.600 --> 41:22.370
Sam?

41:22.420 --> 41:23.840
Are you there?

41:25.100 --> 41:26.980
Yes, Chris, yes.

41:27.020 --> 41:28.850
For some reason...

41:30.230 --> 41:32.680
I'm still here.

41:37.290 --> 41:39.210
later, kid.
