HER NAME'S ELIZABETH
AND SHE HAS BLUE EYES.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.856

A MOLE ON HER RIGHT THIGH.

39:35.938 --> 39:38.680
-GOT A LADY HERE WHO SAYS
SHE'S THE MOTHER.

-SO, THE EX-HUSBAND
TRACKED HER DOWN HERE,

40:03.792 --> 40:05.403
TRIED TO STEAL
THE BABY.

40:05.533 --> 40:06.839
-THAT'S WHY SHE
LEFT HER WITH US

40:06.969 --> 40:08.362
UNTIL SHE COULD
GET AWAY FROM HIM.

40:09.319 --> 40:12.235
-THAT'S RIGHT, BUT,
HE CAUGHT HER, MADE HER
TELL HIM WHERE THE BABY WAS.

40:13.019 --> 40:15.717
SO, GARNER TOOK HIM DOWNTOWN
TO SORT THE WHOLE THING OUT.
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
