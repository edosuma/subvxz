1879. The Civil War is over,

00:41.208 --> 00:45.628
and the resulting economic explosion
spurs the great migration west.

00:45.754 --> 00:50.174
Farmers, ranchers, prospectors,
killers and thieves seek their fortunes.

00:51.260 --> 00:54.178
Cattle drovers turn cow towns
into armed camps

00:54.263 --> 00:59.726
with murder rates higher than those of
modern-day New York or Los Angeles.

00:59.810 --> 01:03.146
Out of this chaos comes
legendary lawman Wyatt Earp,

01:03.272 --> 01:07.608
retiring his badge and gun to start
a peaceful life with his family.

01:07.693 --> 01:10.361
Earp's friend, John "Doc" Holliday,

01:10.487 --> 01:12.697
a Southern gentleman
turned gunman and gambler,

01:12.781 --> 01:17.910
also travels west, hoping the dry
climate will relieve his tuberculosis.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.288
Silver is discovered in Arizona.

01:20.372 --> 01:23.082
Tombstone becomes
queen of the boomtowns,

01:23.167 --> 01:27.128
where the latest Paris fashions
are sold from the backs of wagons.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.505
Attracted to this atmosphere of greed,

01:29.590 --> 01:32.966
over 100 exiled Texas outlaws
band together

01:33.050 --> 01:37.345
to form the ruthless gang recognised
by the red sashes they wear.

01:37.930 --> 01:42.100
They emerge as the earliest example
of organised crime in America.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.187
They call themselves the Cowboys.

03:20.239 --> 03:22.282
Y'all killed two Cowboys.

03:54.231 --> 03:55.732
Shoot.

03:57.902 --> 03:59.652
Looks like we win.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.668
Mexican police, huh?

04:20.214 --> 04:22.467
Tell him to get on his knees.

04:32.478 --> 04:35.813
He will not kneel, patrón.
He is very proud.

04:36.690 --> 04:39.442
Hey, somebody get
this dick on his knees.

04:42.988 --> 04:44.739
Good shot, Billy.

04:51.789 --> 04:54.123
They call me Curly Bill Brocius.

04:55.292 --> 04:59.629
I'm what you might call
the Founder of the Feast.

05:00.547 --> 05:04.717
So next time we come,
you'd better step aside.

05:07.387 --> 05:09.513
I ain't kiddin' neither.

05:19.608 --> 05:24.070
Patrón, he say,
someone will come to revenge for him.

05:24.655 --> 05:27.573
Something like a sick horse
who comes to sit with him.

05:27.658 --> 05:29.409
He talk crazy.

05:30.452 --> 05:33.663
That's not what he said,
ya ignorant wretch.

05:33.747 --> 05:36.624
Your Spanish is worse
than your English.

05:39.003 --> 05:41.087
You go to hell!

05:41.755 --> 05:43.172
You first.

06:09.324 --> 06:12.118
- Hell, let's eat, boys.
- Tamales are good, huh?

06:12.244 --> 06:14.746
I guess they knew we were comin'.

06:37.311 --> 06:40.354
Hey, Johnny,
what'd that Mexican mean,

06:40.481 --> 06:43.107
"A sick horse is gonna get us"?

06:44.568 --> 06:46.694
He's quoting the Bible,

06:47.196 --> 06:48.696
Revelations.

06:50.365 --> 06:55.327
"Behold, a pale horse.
The man who sat on him was Death."

06:57.830 --> 07:00.165
"And Hell followed with him."

07:27.985 --> 07:29.236
Move!

07:31.823 --> 07:34.741
Come on! That's it! You move!

07:36.619 --> 07:38.370
Stupid mule!

07:39.580 --> 07:43.208
Come on! Come on, boy! Come on!

07:52.927 --> 07:54.718
Hurts, don't it?

07:55.595 --> 07:59.056
Now let go of that stud
and go on about your business.

08:11.695 --> 08:14.488
Mr Earp. My name's Dake.

08:14.573 --> 08:17.199
Crawley Dake,
US Marshal for this territory.

08:17.284 --> 08:20.077
- Forget it. I'm retired.
- Excuse me?

08:20.579 --> 08:23.747
I said forget it.
I don't want the job, and that's final.

08:23.874 --> 08:27.209
- I don't think you understand.
- No, you don't understand, Marshal.

08:27.294 --> 08:31.297
I did my duty,
and now I'd like to get on with my life.

08:31.381 --> 08:32.673
I'm going to Tombstone.

08:32.756 --> 08:35.342
- I see. To strike it rich.
- Easy on the grain, Butch.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.178
- Here you go.
- Well, all right, that's fine.

08:37.261 --> 08:39.888
Tell you one thing, though.
Never saw a rich man

08:39.972 --> 08:43.015
who didn't wind up
with a guilty conscience.

08:43.100 --> 08:47.437
I already got a guilty conscience.
Might as well have the money too.

08:47.771 --> 08:49.272
Good day now.

08:52.651 --> 08:56.863
That's him, all right.
Boy, I'd know that sour face anywhere.

09:00.701 --> 09:02.785
Virgil! Morgan! My God!

09:08.876 --> 09:11.169
- Hey, boy! How are you, Morgan?
- Hi, Wyatt.

09:11.629 --> 09:13.922
- Well, how do we look?
- Great, both of ya.

09:14.006 --> 09:16.883
- Wyatt, you remember Allie.
- Good God. Well, he'd better.

09:16.967 --> 09:19.052
Allie girl.

09:19.136 --> 09:21.221
- And Louisa. Oh!
- Wyatt.

09:21.305 --> 09:24.432
You're so lovely, darlin'.
I'm at your feet, just at your feet.

09:24.516 --> 09:27.435
I guess it's only right.
Ma always said Morgan's the prettiest.

09:27.519 --> 09:31.481
- Yeah, but she doted on the frowner.
- That's right.

09:33.025 --> 09:34.025
- Wyatt.
- Mattie!

09:34.109 --> 09:37.570
Mattie, they're already here.
Folks, this is Celia Ann.

09:37.655 --> 09:40.073
- You can call her Mattie.
- Pleased to meet you, Mattie.

09:40.157 --> 09:42.575
It's nice to meet you.

09:42.660 --> 09:45.745
Well, Wyatt, I couldn't find a single
store that had laudanum anywhere.

09:45.829 --> 09:49.332
That's all right, honey.
I sure been dreamin' about this.

09:49.416 --> 09:52.919
God, since forever! Wait! Look here.

09:53.003 --> 09:55.505
Go on up. Look. Huh?

09:58.842 --> 10:01.344
- Hey, Wyatt.
- Don't talk, just...

10:01.428 --> 10:02.845
Yeah.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.141
Thank you for this, Wyatt.

10:07.226 --> 10:10.853
- It's all your doin'.
- We'll make our fortune, boys.

10:11.522 --> 10:13.189
Well, come on.

10:13.315 --> 10:15.692
Gracious. We could be sisters.

10:16.694 --> 10:19.112
Mighty fine.
I wonder where he found her.

10:19.196 --> 10:21.739
Same place we found ours, probably.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.120
Matter, hon? Did you say
you needed some laudanum?

10:28.204 --> 10:30.872
- Yes, I did. Yes.
- I have some right here.

10:30.999 --> 10:32.874
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

10:35.211 --> 10:37.087
Just be careful now. It's full of hop.

10:37.213 --> 10:39.923
Oh, don't worry.
I just get headaches sometimes.

10:40.049 --> 10:42.926
Hey, Virg, see anything of Doc
while you were in Prescott?

10:43.052 --> 10:45.929
Yeah. He had a streak
when we left, him and Kate.

10:46.014 --> 10:48.765
I miss Doc. I miss that old rip.

10:48.891 --> 10:52.227
- I don't.
- He makes me laugh.

10:59.193 --> 11:02.029
That's $500, Holliday.
Are you in or out?

11:11.497 --> 11:15.083
500. Must be a peach of a hand.

11:21.299 --> 11:23.592
Oh, thank you, darlin'.

11:23.718 --> 11:26.928
Kate! You're not wearing a bustle.

11:28.306 --> 11:29.514
How lewd.

11:29.599 --> 11:32.601
Come on, Holliday,
you in or out, goddamn it?

11:33.603 --> 11:37.481
Why, Ed Bailey, you look like
you're just about ready to burst.

11:37.607 --> 11:40.442
Come on! Come on, show!

11:41.819 --> 11:45.238
Well, I suppose I'm deranged, but I...

11:46.074 --> 11:48.825
I guess I'll just have to call.

11:48.910 --> 11:51.036
Cover your ears, darlin'.

11:53.873 --> 11:55.665
Isn't that a daisy?

11:56.459 --> 11:58.543
Why, you son of a bitch!

11:58.628 --> 12:00.587
Damn, Bailey, just settle down!

12:00.671 --> 12:04.549
Shut up! Take your money and get out,

12:05.134 --> 12:08.178
'cause I'm tired of
listenin' to your mouth.

12:08.262 --> 12:10.889
Why, Ed Bailey,

12:10.973 --> 12:12.557
are we cross?

12:14.559 --> 12:16.936
Them guns don't scare me.

12:17.020 --> 12:21.232
'Cause without them guns
you ain't nothin' but a skinny lunger.

12:21.316 --> 12:23.734
Ed, what an ugly thing to say.

12:25.362 --> 12:29.156
I abhor ugliness. Does this mean
we're not friends any more?

12:29.908 --> 12:33.411
You know, Ed, if I thought
you weren't my friend,

12:34.579 --> 12:37.123
I just don't think I could bear it.

12:53.889 --> 12:56.933
There. Now we can be friends again.

13:09.113 --> 13:11.614
Touch that gun, I'll burn you down.

13:21.041 --> 13:23.835
I calculate that's the end of this town.

13:23.919 --> 13:28.047
I had a boy at the hotel pack us up.
The horse is outside.

13:28.716 --> 13:31.843
So that's why you're
not wearin' a bustle.

13:34.054 --> 13:37.348
My sweet, soft Hungarian devil.

13:42.104 --> 13:43.313
Well!

13:48.736 --> 13:50.528
Good evenin', then.

13:55.075 --> 13:57.994
Let's not bother about the luggage.

15:21.161 --> 15:24.080
Hey, Morg, pretty big, isn't it?

15:27.543 --> 15:31.045
Oh-ho, brother, you can smell
the silver in this town.

15:33.757 --> 15:36.384
- Easy.
- Look at these girls over here.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.761
- Hi!
- Hello, girls!

15:38.846 --> 15:41.431
Hot damn, this burg's jumpin'!

15:41.515 --> 15:43.308
Here we go, ladies.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.352
- Isn't that sweet?
- You can say that.

15:56.696 --> 15:58.113
Sheriff.

16:07.206 --> 16:08.749
Newcomers, eh?

16:09.542 --> 16:12.878
The name's John Behan,
Cochise County Sheriff.

16:13.004 --> 16:15.047
- Just hit town, did ya?
- Just this minute.

16:15.131 --> 16:17.341
I'm Wyatt Earp, and these are
my brothers, Virgil and Morgan.

16:17.425 --> 16:19.926
Wyatt Earp. Dodge City.

16:20.053 --> 16:22.721
Gave all that up, Sheriff.
Goin' into business.

16:22.847 --> 16:26.558
- Don't even carry a gun any more.
- Going into business, huh?

16:27.310 --> 16:29.895
Well, then, I'm the man to see.

16:30.730 --> 16:33.523
Besides sheriff, I'm also tax collector,
captain of the fire brigade

16:33.608 --> 16:36.318
and chairman of
the Nonpartisan Anti-Chinese League.

16:36.402 --> 16:38.779
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?

16:40.031 --> 16:42.491
Yeah, a man of many parts.

16:43.451 --> 16:45.994
- Say, you folks got a place to stay yet?
- No.

16:46.079 --> 16:49.915
- Like I said, we just got here.
- I also sit on the town lot commission.

16:51.417 --> 16:53.043
Really?

16:53.127 --> 16:57.214
As a matter of fact, we got three
lovely cottages coming up for rent.

16:57.298 --> 17:00.133
I'll throw in a good cleaning, no charge.

17:01.135 --> 17:02.469
Believe me, Mr Earp,

17:02.553 --> 17:06.306
you're not gonna find a better deal
within town limits.

17:06.391 --> 17:08.141
I don't know, sounds pretty good.

17:08.226 --> 17:11.811
- I'll have my man show 'em to ya.
- Thank you.

17:18.653 --> 17:21.070
Hey, Wyatt, get on over here.

17:22.031 --> 17:24.782
I want you to meet Fred White.
He's the town marshal.

17:24.867 --> 17:27.035
- My pleasure.
- Lotta law around here.

17:27.119 --> 17:30.288
- I already met the county sheriff.
- Who, Behan?

17:30.373 --> 17:34.083
He ain't no law. The only real law
around here is the Cowboys.

17:34.167 --> 17:38.336
Cowboys? I had a run-in
with a couple of them up in Prescott.

17:38.421 --> 17:42.090
Nobody does nothin' without 'em.
I mean, they're it.

17:42.174 --> 17:44.050
There's three of 'em right over there.

17:44.135 --> 17:48.138
You can always spot a Cowboy.
They always wear those red sashes.

17:48.806 --> 17:51.015
The plain fact is the Cowboys
are good for business.

17:51.100 --> 17:52.892
'Bout all these saloons?

17:52.977 --> 17:55.603
Oh, that's the real mother lode
here in Tombstone.

17:55.688 --> 17:57.772
All up and down Allen Street here.

17:57.857 --> 18:00.984
24 hours a day,
you got liquor, hostesses, gamblin',

18:01.068 --> 18:03.445
makin' money hand over fist.

18:03.529 --> 18:07.323
All except The Oriental.
That's a regular slaughterhouse.

18:08.242 --> 18:10.994
Even the high rollers won't go near it.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.788
That's too bad too. It's a nice place.

18:15.332 --> 18:17.292
Hell of a waste.

18:19.754 --> 18:21.212
Wyatt?

18:21.338 --> 18:23.506
- There he goes.
- Yeah.

18:25.259 --> 18:26.760
OI' Wyatt.

18:32.850 --> 18:35.185
All right, fella,
I'll brace ya now for a little lesson.

18:35.311 --> 18:38.646
Put your money on the board.
$5 on that six of spades.

18:38.731 --> 18:40.982
Like that.

18:41.692 --> 18:45.612
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Get that cigar outta my face.

18:46.363 --> 18:48.281
Howdy, stranger. What can I get ya?

18:48.365 --> 18:50.283
I wouldn't mind one of those cigars.

18:50.367 --> 18:52.619
I'm about ready to go home.
I wish y'all would stop yakkin'

18:52.703 --> 18:55.038
- and just play cards.
- Thank you.

18:55.623 --> 18:58.458
Kinda nice in here. You run it?

18:58.876 --> 19:00.710
Milt Joyce, owner, operator.

19:00.836 --> 19:04.297
- Wyatt Earp.
- Yeah, sure.

19:04.381 --> 19:07.091
I said lay off the queen, you jackass!

19:07.176 --> 19:10.011
I swear I'm gonna slap somebody now.

19:10.095 --> 19:14.849
Excuse me for askin', Milt,
but kinda dead in here, isn't it?

19:14.934 --> 19:18.770
- You don't listen too good, do ya?
- See that bird at the faro table?

19:18.896 --> 19:20.896
You back that queen again,
you son of a bitch,

19:20.980 --> 19:24.608
I'll blow you right up that wildcat's ass!
Do you hear me, huh?

19:24.734 --> 19:26.401
He comes bargin' in here one day,

19:26.528 --> 19:28.695
slappin' all the customers,
wavin' his gun around.

19:28.780 --> 19:31.073
He chased out all the high-class play.

19:31.157 --> 19:33.784
The only trade that comes in here now
is the bummers and the drovers,

19:33.868 --> 19:35.118
just the dregs.

19:35.245 --> 19:38.997
Why don't you get rid of him,
get yourself a straight dealer?

19:39.082 --> 19:41.166
Sure, stranger,
that's easy for you to say.

19:41.251 --> 19:42.709
Shit!

19:46.256 --> 19:48.674
Goddamn it, Junior,
how many times am I going to tell you

19:48.758 --> 19:52.553
to keep that damn cigar outta my face?

19:53.471 --> 19:55.681
Christ almighty,
it's like I'm sittin' here playing cards

19:55.765 --> 19:57.432
with my brother's kids or somethin',

19:57.517 --> 19:59.935
you nerve-racking sons of bitches.

20:02.438 --> 20:04.648
Is somethin' on your mind?

20:05.441 --> 20:08.694
Just want to let you know
you're sittin' in my chair.

20:08.778 --> 20:10.779
Is that a fact?

20:10.864 --> 20:12.614
Yeah, it's a fact.

20:12.699 --> 20:16.785
For a man that don't go heeled, you run
your mouth kinda reckless, don't ya?

20:16.870 --> 20:20.455
No need to go heeled to get
the bulge on a dub like you.

20:21.374 --> 20:23.292
Is that a fact?

20:24.878 --> 20:26.628
That's a fact.

20:28.214 --> 20:31.300
Well, I'm real scared.

20:31.384 --> 20:35.512
Damn right, you're scared.
I can see that in your eyes.

20:35.597 --> 20:38.307
- All right now!
- Go ahead.

20:38.391 --> 20:42.477
Go ahead, skin it! Skin that
smoke wagon and see what happens.

20:45.398 --> 20:48.108
Listen, mister,
I'm gettin' awful tired of your...

20:48.192 --> 20:52.321
I'm gettin' tired of your gas.
Nowjerk that pistol and go to work.

20:54.741 --> 20:56.992
I said throw down, boy.

21:04.667 --> 21:08.127
You gonna do somethin',
or just stand there and bleed?

21:11.214 --> 21:12.506
No?

21:16.178 --> 21:17.970
I didn't think so.

21:18.680 --> 21:20.973
Here, Milt, a keepsake.

21:24.186 --> 21:28.064
Hang it over the bar.
All right, youngster, out you go.

21:30.150 --> 21:32.526
Don't come back!

21:32.653 --> 21:33.861
Ever!

21:39.159 --> 21:41.202
Well, what do you say, Milt?

21:41.286 --> 21:44.330
25% of the house take
sound about right?

21:51.338 --> 21:54.256
Well, we're off and runnin'.

21:54.341 --> 21:57.259
Just acquired us a quarter interest
in the game at the Oriental.

21:57.344 --> 21:59.553
- Acquired?
- So to speak.

22:03.725 --> 22:06.435
Now all we gotta do is keep our
eyes on that brass ring, fellas.

22:06.561 --> 22:08.437
You're the one, Wyatt.

22:09.147 --> 22:11.148
Why, Johnny Tyler!

22:12.651 --> 22:14.986
- You madcap!
- Doc?

22:15.529 --> 22:18.030
Where you goin' with that shotgun?

22:18.949 --> 22:21.617
I didn't know you was back in town.

22:24.162 --> 22:25.997
Well, well.

22:28.207 --> 22:29.749
How the hell are you?

22:29.834 --> 22:33.461
Wyatt, I am rolling. Morgan.

22:34.130 --> 22:36.256
- Doc.
- Virgil.

22:36.966 --> 22:38.758
'Lo, Doc.

22:39.176 --> 22:40.760
Wyatt Earp?

22:46.392 --> 22:48.810
Going into business for ourselves, Doc.

22:48.936 --> 22:52.272
Wyatt just got us a faro game.

22:52.356 --> 22:54.648
Since when is faro a business?

22:54.774 --> 22:57.192
Didn't you always say that
gambling's an honest trade?

22:57.277 --> 22:59.486
No. I said poker's an honest trade.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.489
Only suckers buck the tiger.
The odds are all on the house.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.991
Depends on how you look at it.

23:04.075 --> 23:07.202
I mean, it's not like anybody's
puttin' a gun to their head now, is it?

23:07.287 --> 23:11.665
That's what I love about Wyatt.
He can talk himself into anything.

23:13.460 --> 23:17.921
Oh. Johnny, I apologise.
I forgot you were there.

23:18.006 --> 23:19.798
You may go now.

23:20.550 --> 23:22.801
Just leave that shotgun.

23:27.307 --> 23:28.724
Leave it.

23:31.144 --> 23:32.561
Thank you.

23:36.608 --> 23:39.610
- Sheriff Behan!
- Gentlemen!

23:39.694 --> 23:42.905
Sheriff, have you met Doc Holliday?

23:42.989 --> 23:44.740
Piss on you, Wyatt.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.534
Mr Holliday.

23:50.163 --> 23:52.915
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.921
- So, how's our little town suit you?
- Fine. Fine.

23:58.005 --> 24:01.674
You know, I was thinking, what this
town could really use is a racetrack.

24:01.759 --> 24:06.429
Really? That's not a bad idea.
Send a signal we're growin' up.

24:06.514 --> 24:07.931
Way ahead of yourselves,
aren't you, boys?

24:08.015 --> 24:10.141
This is just another mining camp.

24:10.226 --> 24:13.853
Have you seen how everyone dresses?
Awful tony for a mining camp.

24:13.938 --> 24:15.980
No sir, the die is cast. We are growin'.

24:16.065 --> 24:19.859
Be as big as San Francisco in
a few years, and just as sophisticated.

24:22.196 --> 24:23.905
You son of a bitch!

24:23.989 --> 24:26.950
Easy, gents! It's a private affair!

24:27.034 --> 24:28.618
Don't raise that iron.
I don't wanna have to...

24:28.702 --> 24:31.538
I'll kill you, you cheatin' son of a...

24:33.874 --> 24:35.917
Very cosmopolitan.

24:37.545 --> 24:40.213
I know him. That's Creek Johnson.

24:43.508 --> 24:45.884
Wyatt? Doc?

24:47.637 --> 24:50.222
- Jack.
- What do you say, old friend?

24:52.725 --> 24:55.227
What the hell's that all about, Creek?

24:55.311 --> 24:58.188
He crawfished a bet
and called me a liar.

24:58.273 --> 25:01.483
Sheriff, may I present
a pair of fellow sophisticates.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.110
Turkey Creek Jack Johnson,

25:03.194 --> 25:05.404
Texas Jack Vermillion.

25:05.530 --> 25:07.531
Watch your ear, Creek.

25:09.159 --> 25:13.036
- Afraid I'll have to have those guns.
- It was a fair fight. We was legal.

25:13.121 --> 25:16.039
I'm sorry, boys.
I gotta take you before Judge Spicer.

25:16.124 --> 25:17.791
Hand 'em over.

25:18.626 --> 25:20.627
Law and order every time, that's us.

25:36.519 --> 25:38.145
I'm frightfully thirsty.

25:38.271 --> 25:41.148
Well, we made it safe and sound.

25:46.279 --> 25:48.780
Sheriff, what kinda town is this?

25:52.952 --> 25:54.661
Nice scenery.

26:00.501 --> 26:04.421
Well, an enchanted moment.

26:10.470 --> 26:14.806
Interesting little scene.
I wonder who that tall drink of water is.

26:15.391 --> 26:18.810
My dear, you have set your gaze
upon the quintessential frontier type.

26:18.937 --> 26:23.732
Note the lean silhouette, eyes closed
by the sun, though sharp as a hawk.

26:23.816 --> 26:27.194
He's got the look of
both predator and prey.

26:27.779 --> 26:29.779
I want one.

26:29.863 --> 26:31.656
Happy hunting.

26:58.141 --> 27:00.393
Hey there, sister boy!

27:00.978 --> 27:02.478
Please, sister boy, gimme some!

27:02.562 --> 27:05.773
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- Leave him alone, Barnes!

27:05.857 --> 27:08.776
Billy, sit with me.

27:15.659 --> 27:19.577
This is so much fun. We haven't
been to a show since years.

27:19.704 --> 27:22.289
I hope they're good.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.127
- Wyatt?
- Oh, sorry.

27:30.798 --> 27:33.049
Darlin', you know the Earps.

27:33.968 --> 27:36.177
Kate, how you been?

27:37.680 --> 27:40.557
Mattie, ravishin'.

27:40.641 --> 27:42.100
Doc.

27:44.895 --> 27:48.481
Wyatt, I'd like ya
to meet Mayor Clum and his wife.

27:48.566 --> 27:49.816
- Mr Earp.
- Mayor.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.818
Your reputation precedes you.

27:51.902 --> 27:56.114
- I was wondering if you might be...
- Not a prayer. Nice meetin' you.

28:09.045 --> 28:12.672
Professor Gillman? Oh, I seen him
in Bisbee. He catches stuff.

28:12.757 --> 28:15.257
Hey, Professor, catch this.

28:17.969 --> 28:21.472
They're shooting at us!
They're actually shooting at us.

28:22.390 --> 28:25.434
At least we won't have to wait
for our notices.

28:26.436 --> 28:28.896
Prettiest man I ever saw.

28:32.984 --> 28:34.276
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:34.361 --> 28:36.904
the St Crispin's Day
speech from Henry V.

28:36.988 --> 28:38.739
To set the scene...

28:39.324 --> 28:42.534
- Goddamn, Barnes!
- Almost shot my damn ear off.

28:42.619 --> 28:45.079
"If we are marked to die,

28:45.163 --> 28:47.956
"we are now to do our country loss.

28:48.041 --> 28:52.753
"But if to live, the fewer men,
the greater share of honour."

28:52.837 --> 28:56.507
He's got some nerve, I'll say that.
What d'ya think there, Billy Nilly?

28:56.633 --> 28:58.550
I think he's wonderful.

28:59.344 --> 29:01.553
"...gentle his condition.

29:01.638 --> 29:04.014
"Gentlemen in England now abed shall
think themselves accurs'd

29:04.099 --> 29:06.183
"they were not here,

29:06.309 --> 29:08.811
"and hold their manhoods cheap

29:08.895 --> 29:13.399
"whilst any speaks who fought with us
upon Saint Crispin's day."

29:13.942 --> 29:16.735
That's great! That's our kinda stuff!

29:25.328 --> 29:26.662
Play it again!

29:36.673 --> 29:39.508
Now what in the hell is this?

29:39.592 --> 29:43.011
That's Faust.
He's gonna make a deal with the devil.

29:45.598 --> 29:47.850
Is your soul for sale, dear?

30:02.531 --> 30:04.490
Know what I'd do?

30:04.575 --> 30:08.953
I'd take a deal and then crawfish
and drill that old devil in the ass.

30:11.290 --> 30:14.208
How 'bout you, Juanito?
What would you do?

30:15.544 --> 30:17.211
I already did it.

30:37.357 --> 30:39.066
Very instructive.

30:46.909 --> 30:48.868
But who was the devil?

31:02.132 --> 31:03.925
I'll be damned.

31:05.344 --> 31:07.887
You may indeed, if you get lucky.

31:13.602 --> 31:15.478
Would you look at all those stars?

31:15.604 --> 31:19.941
I mean, you look up and you think,
"God made all of that?

31:20.025 --> 31:23.194
"He still remembered to make
a little speck like me."

31:23.278 --> 31:26.197
Kinda flattering, really.

31:26.281 --> 31:28.950
Wyatt, do you believe in God?

31:29.076 --> 31:33.663
- No, come on, really. Do ya?
- Yeah. Maybe. Hell, I don't know.

31:33.747 --> 31:35.957
Well, what d'you think
happens when you die?

31:36.083 --> 31:38.417
Somethin'. Nothin'. Hell, I don't know.

31:38.502 --> 31:41.212
Well, I read this book,
a book on spiritualism.

31:41.296 --> 31:43.756
Oh, God, here he goes again.

31:43.840 --> 31:47.009
Said that a lot of people
when they die, they see this light.

31:47.094 --> 31:49.469
- Like in a tunnel.
- Yeah?

31:49.595 --> 31:51.137
They say it's the light
leadin' you to heaven.

31:51.222 --> 31:52.264
Really?

31:52.348 --> 31:54.516
Well, what about hell?
They got a sign there, or what?

31:54.642 --> 31:55.850
Hey, Wyatt, goddamn it.

31:55.935 --> 31:58.228
- I'm serious.
- Hey, Morg.

31:58.312 --> 31:59.771
Comin' to the Oriental, Virg?

31:59.855 --> 32:02.065
- Well.
- Not tonight.

32:02.149 --> 32:04.943
Tonight, me and my old man
are gonna have some fun.

32:05.027 --> 32:07.070
Come on, get movin', old man.

32:07.154 --> 32:10.072
Maiden name was Sullivan.

32:12.659 --> 32:15.911
Well, you better go with them, honey.
I gotta go to work.

32:15.996 --> 32:17.830
Please stay with me.

32:17.914 --> 32:20.416
Well, honey, I gotta get to work.

32:21.418 --> 32:24.628
All right. All right.

32:25.005 --> 32:28.257
Well, wait a minute.
I guess I don't have to go right now. I...

32:28.341 --> 32:30.884
- I could stay awhile.
- No, no. I don't wanna keep you.

32:31.011 --> 32:33.512
No, really, I can stay awhile.

32:35.515 --> 32:37.850
That the bottle Lou gave you?

32:38.685 --> 32:40.311
Yes, it is.

32:41.896 --> 32:44.189
Maybe you should see a doctor.

32:45.442 --> 32:47.901
Wyatt, it's just headaches.

32:48.695 --> 32:51.113
I know what I'm doing.
No, I don't need to see a doctor!

32:51.197 --> 32:53.782
- All right, honey. Okay.
- Just go.

32:54.868 --> 32:56.994
Everything's fine, Wyatt.

32:57.078 --> 33:00.205
- Work well.
- All right, good night.

33:02.709 --> 33:05.169
You look beautiful tonight.

33:06.755 --> 33:08.339
Thank you.

33:10.759 --> 33:13.719
- Night, Mattie.
- Good night, Morgan.

33:17.058 --> 33:18.391
Come on.

33:22.897 --> 33:25.899
I want to match seven,
seven stinkin' spades.

33:25.983 --> 33:27.817
- Let's go.
- I'm your man.

33:27.902 --> 33:30.987
You win again. Well played, sir.
You are on fire.

33:31.072 --> 33:33.239
- I told you, I'm burnin' up tonight.
- Loser on the ace.

33:33.324 --> 33:36.909
I'll take the red seven,
and I got some deeds here.

33:37.035 --> 33:40.663
- I'll take seven stinkin' diamonds.
- Awful lot of money.

33:40.747 --> 33:42.706
You can't stand the heat, pal,
get out of the kitchen.

33:42.791 --> 33:43.874
You're the doctor.

33:43.958 --> 33:46.085
Sad news, friend, you lose.

33:47.212 --> 33:50.047
- So, now we're in the mining business.
- You're the one, Wyatt.

33:50.131 --> 33:52.633
We're turnin' into regular tycoons.

33:52.717 --> 33:54.510
Think I'll call this one
the Mattie Blaylock.

33:54.594 --> 33:55.803
Mattie'd get a kick outta that one.

33:55.887 --> 33:58.472
- That's her maiden name.
- And what a maiden.

33:58.598 --> 34:01.475
- Pure as the driven snow, I'm sure.
- Hey, Doc, come on now.

34:01.601 --> 34:05.104
It's just his style, Morg.
He doesn't mean anything.

34:05.230 --> 34:07.815
Tell me something, my friend.
I'm curious.

34:07.899 --> 34:12.777
Do you actually consider yourself
a married man, forsaking all others?

34:12.862 --> 34:14.530
Yeah, pretty much.

34:14.614 --> 34:18.449
I mean, I was no angel
when we met, but neither was she.

34:18.534 --> 34:22.705
People can change, Doc.
Sooner or later, you gotta grow up.

34:23.206 --> 34:24.456
I see.

34:25.792 --> 34:28.877
And what would you do,
if she walked in here?

34:29.462 --> 34:33.632
- "She"?
- You know damn well who I mean.

34:34.217 --> 34:36.592
That dusky-hued
lady satan, that's who.

34:36.678 --> 34:38.929
- Oh, I'd probably ignore her.
- Ignore her?

34:39.013 --> 34:41.931
I'd ignore her. People can change, Doc.

34:42.016 --> 34:44.351
I'll remember you said that.

34:45.145 --> 34:46.353
What?

34:49.733 --> 34:53.735
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Ma'am? Miss Marcus?

34:53.820 --> 34:55.237
Aw, hell.

34:59.325 --> 35:01.326
Bravo!

35:20.930 --> 35:23.556
Miss Marcus, allow me
the pleasure of a drink.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.559
- Thank you, sir.
- Milt, champagne!

35:27.352 --> 35:28.519
Satisfied?

35:28.604 --> 35:31.814
I stand corrected, Wyatt. You're an oak.

35:44.036 --> 35:45.536
Thanks, Kate.

35:56.006 --> 35:57.590
Mr Fabian.

35:58.091 --> 35:59.509
- Well done.
- Well done.

35:59.593 --> 36:01.427
Good show, partner, good show.

36:01.553 --> 36:04.388
Mr Fabian, would you
come sit at my table?

36:05.849 --> 36:08.351
Mr Earp, would you mind signing
an autograph for me, sir?

36:10.437 --> 36:12.897
My wife's not gonna believe this.

36:18.487 --> 36:22.073
Wyatt Earp, huh? Heard of you.

36:24.243 --> 36:27.245
Listen now, Mr Kansas Law Dog.

36:27.329 --> 36:29.956
Law don't go around here. Savvy?

36:30.624 --> 36:33.751
- I'm retired.
- Good.

36:33.836 --> 36:35.795
That's real good.

36:35.879 --> 36:40.299
Yeah. Yeah, that's real good, law dog,
'cause lawjust don't go around here.

36:40.425 --> 36:41.843
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

36:41.927 --> 36:44.178
Winner to the king. $500.

36:48.433 --> 36:52.687
- Shut up, Ike.
- You must be Doc Holliday.

36:54.731 --> 36:56.607
That's the rumour.

36:56.692 --> 36:58.442
You retired too?

37:00.111 --> 37:02.737
Not me. I'm in my prime.

37:03.739 --> 37:05.448
Yeah, you look it.

37:08.452 --> 37:11.078
You must be Ringo.

37:11.162 --> 37:14.373
Look, darlin', Johnny Ringo,

37:14.457 --> 37:17.960
the deadliest pistoleer
since Wild Bill, they say.

37:20.297 --> 37:23.090
What do you think, darlin',
should I hate him?

37:23.174 --> 37:27.428
- You don't even know him.
- No. That's true, but...

37:27.512 --> 37:31.223
I don't know,
there's just somethin' about him.

37:31.308 --> 37:33.517
Somethin' 'round the eyes.

37:35.395 --> 37:37.021
I don't know.

37:37.147 --> 37:38.814
Reminds me of...

37:39.816 --> 37:40.983
Me.

37:42.569 --> 37:45.654
No. I'm sure of it, I hate him.

37:46.656 --> 37:48.324
He's drunk.

38:11.514 --> 38:16.018
Come on, boys, we don't want any
trouble in here, not in any language.

38:16.603 --> 38:18.270
That's Latin, darlin'.

38:18.355 --> 38:21.106
Evidently, Mr Ringo's
an educated man.

38:22.609 --> 38:24.735
Now I really hate him.

38:25.862 --> 38:27.529
Watch it, Johnny.

38:28.531 --> 38:30.741
I hear he's real fast.

38:40.418 --> 38:42.544
Come on. Go, Johnny.

39:44.440 --> 39:45.898
Bravo!

39:55.534 --> 39:57.201
Drinks are on me!

40:04.835 --> 40:07.670
Gettin' kinda spooky around here.

40:07.755 --> 40:09.714
Curly Bill, huh?

40:10.132 --> 40:13.593
- Who was that other idiot?
- Ike Clanton.

40:13.677 --> 40:17.305
- Table's open!
- The man dealing faro, who is he?

40:17.806 --> 40:22.810
That's Wyatt Earp. Made a name for
himself as a peace officer in Kansas.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.439
Peace officer.

40:26.523 --> 40:28.232
Very impressive.

40:31.403 --> 40:33.696
I believe he's married.

40:36.992 --> 40:38.826
More champagne?

40:55.009 --> 40:56.802
Oh, hell.

41:05.686 --> 41:07.521
- Hello.
- Hello.

41:08.940 --> 41:11.608
We've never actually met.
My name is...

41:11.692 --> 41:13.860
Wyatt Earp. Yes, I know.

41:13.945 --> 41:16.238
- I'm...
- Josephine Marcus.

41:17.281 --> 41:19.032
Everybody knows.

41:20.034 --> 41:22.285
I was beginning to think
we'd never meet.

41:22.370 --> 41:25.539
This is fortuitous. That means "lucky."

41:26.415 --> 41:28.625
Yeah, I know what it means.

41:30.336 --> 41:32.420
- Easy now.
- What is it?

41:32.505 --> 41:34.464
That mare is in season.

41:35.424 --> 41:37.342
Bet she's starting.

41:37.593 --> 41:41.847
- How do they know?
- They know. It's the scent.

41:46.102 --> 41:47.936
Well, I guess we'd better split 'em up.
It's been real...

41:48.062 --> 41:49.563
I have a better idea.

41:49.689 --> 41:51.897
Let's run it out of them.

41:54.109 --> 41:56.068
Yeah, I'm an oak, all right.

42:39.988 --> 42:42.573
Well, end of the road.

42:42.657 --> 42:44.158
Maybe for you.

43:06.514 --> 43:07.890
That was lovely.

43:07.974 --> 43:11.018
Lovely? You could've been
killed back there, or busted up.

43:11.144 --> 43:13.229
Fun, though, wasn't it?

43:13.313 --> 43:16.232
- You'd die for fun?
- Wouldn't you?

43:18.109 --> 43:21.320
Oh, he's laughing.
I didn't think you ever laughed.

43:21.404 --> 43:23.572
Yeah, I laugh sometimes.

43:23.657 --> 43:26.242
Yes, but how often? Are you happy?

43:26.826 --> 43:30.996
Am I happy? Well, I don't know.
I'm happy as the next man, I guess.

43:31.831 --> 43:35.459
I don't laugh all day long like an idiot,
if that's what you mean.

43:35.543 --> 43:38.254
- Touchy about it, aren't you?
- No, I'm not touchy. I'm just...

43:38.338 --> 43:39.838
It's a silly question, is all.

43:39.923 --> 43:42.341
"Am I happy? Are you happy?"
Are you happy?

43:42.425 --> 43:45.469
Oh, I'm always happy,
unless I'm bored.

43:46.263 --> 43:49.181
That blonde woman, is that your wife?

43:51.518 --> 43:53.686
- What about her?
- Nothing.

43:55.063 --> 43:57.314
What do you want out of life?

44:01.027 --> 44:03.195
- How do you get these questions?
- Just answer.

44:03.280 --> 44:05.281
I don't know!
Make some money, I guess.

44:05.365 --> 44:08.867
- Maybe have some children.
- Doesn't suit you.

44:09.953 --> 44:12.955
- Well, how would you know?
- It just doesn't, that's all.

44:13.039 --> 44:14.581
I oughta know my own mind,

44:14.666 --> 44:17.042
and I'm telling you what suits me
is a family and kids.

44:17.168 --> 44:20.295
Suits me right down to the ground.
In fact, that's my idea of heaven.

44:20.379 --> 44:22.714
All right, what's your idea of heaven?

44:22.798 --> 44:24.257
Room service.

44:26.385 --> 44:29.637
Oh, he's laughing again.
Well, that's what I want.

44:30.681 --> 44:34.225
I wanna move and go places
and never look back.

44:34.310 --> 44:36.561
Just have fun, forever.

44:36.687 --> 44:40.773
That's my idea of heaven.
Need someone to share it with, though.

44:42.609 --> 44:44.444
You mean Behan.

44:47.239 --> 44:48.990
Well, then...

44:51.201 --> 44:52.702
Why are you with him?

44:52.786 --> 44:57.081
Because he's handsome
and he's charming and...

44:57.207 --> 44:59.167
He's all right. For now.

45:00.544 --> 45:03.087
Oh, I know, don't say it, I'm rotten.

45:03.172 --> 45:07.050
I've tried to be good. It's just so boring.

45:07.134 --> 45:09.385
The way you talk.

45:09.470 --> 45:12.764
Never heard a woman talk like that?

45:14.308 --> 45:15.725
Never.

45:16.602 --> 45:20.188
I don't have time to be proper.
I wanna live.

45:21.607 --> 45:23.816
I'm a woman. I like men.

45:23.901 --> 45:28.237
If that means I'm not ladylike,
then I guess I'm just not a lady.

45:28.322 --> 45:31.074
- At least I'm honest.
- You're different.

45:32.785 --> 45:35.495
There's no arguin' that.

45:35.579 --> 45:37.914
But you're a lady, all right.

45:39.792 --> 45:41.793
I'll take my oath on it.

45:46.340 --> 45:48.758
Come on! Giddap!

46:05.650 --> 46:07.984
Is that the opium Lou gave you?

46:11.114 --> 46:13.323
It's a new bottle, isn't it?

46:14.992 --> 46:17.452
You better go easy on that stuff.

46:17.537 --> 46:19.496
Wyatt, leave me alone.

46:21.416 --> 46:25.794
- And where've you been?
- Just out. Ridin'.

46:31.801 --> 46:33.969
How're you feelin', Mattie?

46:39.016 --> 46:41.058
I don't know.

46:41.351 --> 46:42.893
I'm all right.

46:44.563 --> 46:46.355
I'm fine.

46:47.524 --> 46:50.192
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

46:51.903 --> 46:55.364
Well, I was thinkin' today,

46:56.741 --> 46:59.743
we've already made
a pile of money in this place.

46:59.828 --> 47:02.163
If we pulled up stakes
and just moved on, you know,

47:02.247 --> 47:04.999
then we could stay on the move,
keep goin', see the world.

47:05.083 --> 47:08.961
Just live on room service
for the rest of our lives.

47:09.045 --> 47:10.880
How'd that be?

47:11.465 --> 47:13.507
Room service?

47:16.136 --> 47:18.554
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?

47:23.226 --> 47:24.977
Nothin'. I just...

47:25.061 --> 47:27.980
Just thinkin' out loud, and you know I...

47:29.816 --> 47:31.442
Nothin'.

47:34.279 --> 47:36.071
Forget about it.

47:56.342 --> 47:58.843
What's she doin' with that lunger?

48:10.231 --> 48:15.401
Hey.

48:16.654 --> 48:20.740
Is that Old Dog Tray?
That sounds like Old Dog Tray to me.

48:22.284 --> 48:23.535
Pardon?

48:24.954 --> 48:27.288
You know, Stephen Foster.

48:28.123 --> 48:30.250
Oh! Susanna.

48:30.334 --> 48:32.377
Camptown Races.

48:35.047 --> 48:37.340
Stephen stinkin' Foster!

48:38.133 --> 48:42.095
Yes, well,
this happens to be a nocturne.

48:43.055 --> 48:45.890
- A which?
- You know,

48:45.975 --> 48:48.226
Frederic fucking Chopin.

48:59.405 --> 49:00.989
Oh, yeah.

49:15.838 --> 49:18.339
Boy, I feel great.

49:20.634 --> 49:24.512
I feel just capital.

49:55.835 --> 49:58.378
Do you see what's going on
in the street?

49:58.463 --> 50:01.298
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- I believe you're the sheriff.

50:01.382 --> 50:05.552
No, no. This is not county business.
This is a town matter. Marshal?

50:09.599 --> 50:11.600
Why don't you just leave it alone?

50:11.684 --> 50:15.395
No, I gotta do somethin'.

50:20.401 --> 50:22.402
Here's your down card.

50:41.839 --> 50:43.256
Curly Bill!

50:47.261 --> 50:48.762
Come on now.

50:50.431 --> 50:52.307
Well, howdy, Fred.

50:53.226 --> 50:55.936
Hand those over, Curly. Hand 'em over.

51:00.024 --> 51:02.150
Why, sure, dad.

51:04.404 --> 51:06.530
I'm only funnin'.

51:07.824 --> 51:09.408
Here you go.

51:21.796 --> 51:23.255
Fred?

51:24.257 --> 51:26.090
Come on now. Fred?

51:30.554 --> 51:33.930
- Got ol' Fred White!
- Hey, he shot the marshal! Everybody!

51:34.014 --> 51:36.307
Better get him off the street.

51:37.977 --> 51:40.895
Fred White's dead! They killed him.
They killed Fred White!

51:40.980 --> 51:45.316
- All right, back off.
- Get a rope! String him up!

51:45.401 --> 51:48.069
- Nobody's hangin' anybody.
- He just killed a man!

51:48.154 --> 51:51.364
Then he'll stand trial for it.
Now get back! Move!

51:55.662 --> 51:57.204
Turn him loose!

52:05.797 --> 52:08.632
He said to turn loose of him.

52:08.717 --> 52:11.927
Well, I'm not. So go home.

52:12.721 --> 52:17.933
I swear to God, law dog, you don't
step aside, we'll tear you apart.

52:18.018 --> 52:21.270
All right, you die first. Get it?

52:21.938 --> 52:23.355
Your friends might get me in a rush,

52:23.440 --> 52:27.109
but not before I make your head
into a canoe. You understand me?

52:27.194 --> 52:30.863
- He's bluffin'. Let's rush him.
- No, he ain't bluffin'.

52:32.157 --> 52:34.825
You're not as stupid as you look, Ike.

52:35.410 --> 52:38.704
- Now tell them to get back.
- Go on now, get back.

52:38.789 --> 52:41.373
Go on! Billy!

52:42.709 --> 52:44.502
He'll kill me.

52:48.548 --> 52:51.258
And you, music lover,

52:52.260 --> 52:53.719
you're next.

52:55.138 --> 52:58.140
It's the drunk piano player.

52:58.225 --> 53:00.935
You're so drunk, you can't hit nothin'.

53:01.019 --> 53:04.438
In fact, you're probably seein' double.

53:04.564 --> 53:08.400
I have two guns, one for each of ya.

53:11.029 --> 53:13.112
All right, break it up now!

53:17.910 --> 53:19.452
Go home now!

53:31.131 --> 53:32.841
I'll see you soon.

53:34.593 --> 53:37.387
- I'll see you soon.
- We'll meet again.

53:42.643 --> 53:44.769
Well, as you can see,

53:45.771 --> 53:47.605
never a dull moment.

54:13.632 --> 54:16.050
So it takes Judge Spicer
three weeks to get back to town,

54:16.135 --> 54:18.803
and he says,
"Well, did you actually see it?"

54:18.888 --> 54:22.849
I said, "No. By the time I got there,
Marshal White had already been shot."

54:22.933 --> 54:24.851
Then Spicer leans forward
and he says,

54:24.935 --> 54:28.229
"Well, can't have a murder
without a witness."

54:28.314 --> 54:31.107
- What?
- Case dismissed. Can you beat it?

54:31.317 --> 54:34.986
After all that? Aw, hell, who cares?

54:35.070 --> 54:37.530
None of my business anyway.

54:37.823 --> 54:40.199
There you go, Milt.

54:40.284 --> 54:44.203
God, I love this game!
You know, boys, when we're finally set,

54:44.955 --> 54:48.124
we gotta each have
a billiard room in our houses.

54:48.208 --> 54:49.584
I been thinkin',

54:49.668 --> 54:52.962
maybe we oughta open up
a place of our own. You know?

54:53.047 --> 54:56.174
There's the real money. Build it up,

54:56.258 --> 54:58.801
milk it for all it's worth,
then sell it off for a bundle,

54:58.886 --> 55:01.094
and breeze outta this burg
with more money than Croesus

55:01.179 --> 55:02.679
and ready to live like kings.

55:02.764 --> 55:04.932
What d'ya think, Virg?

55:08.686 --> 55:10.896
Virg? Why don't you and me
take a walk around town

55:11.022 --> 55:14.441
and see if we can't spot us out
a couple of nice lots?

55:16.819 --> 55:19.863
It's workin' out just like you said, Wyatt.

55:19.948 --> 55:22.908
Goddamn, boys, we're lootin'
this burg six ways from Sunday.

55:22.992 --> 55:24.284
Pretty fun too, isn't it?

55:24.369 --> 55:26.745
Financially, yeah, I gotta admit.

55:26.871 --> 55:29.039
Excuse me.
Wyatt, do you have a moment?

55:29.123 --> 55:31.416
- Please, will you just hear me out?
- Now hold on, Mayor.

55:31.542 --> 55:32.542
He already told you no.

55:32.627 --> 55:35.337
You tell him, Morg.

55:35.421 --> 55:37.923
What about you? You were a lawman.

55:40.885 --> 55:42.678
I'm busy.

55:43.054 --> 55:44.888
We're all busy.

55:46.015 --> 55:49.267
Sorry, Mayor,
but you're barkin' up the wrong tree.

55:49.352 --> 55:52.020
You know, you men are makin'
a lot of money in this town.

55:52.105 --> 55:54.815
That's good. That's good.
Good for you.

55:54.899 --> 55:58.151
In the meantime, a lot of
decent people are suffering.

55:58.236 --> 56:02.906
But, please, don't let me take up
any more of your precious time.

56:06.995 --> 56:09.162
Rack 'em.

56:09.247 --> 56:12.708
I tell ya, I'm suffering.
From a hangover.

56:21.300 --> 56:22.425
Stop that!

56:22.509 --> 56:25.511
- Stop.
- No.

57:20.566 --> 57:23.985
Hold on a minute! Wait a minute!

57:24.111 --> 57:27.322
- Calm down and listen to me!
- Yeah, let him speak!

57:27.406 --> 57:30.200
Nobody's sayin' you can't own a gun.

57:30.326 --> 57:33.369
Nobody's even sayin'
you can't carry a gun.

57:33.454 --> 57:36.831
All we're sayin' is you
can't carry a gun in town.

57:41.045 --> 57:43.296
That's not so bad, is it?

57:49.512 --> 57:52.013
Listen, Mayor, I have
to talk to you about this.

57:52.098 --> 57:55.183
No, we don't have to talk.
You can read, can't you?

57:55.267 --> 57:56.309
It's a town matter, not county.

57:56.393 --> 58:00.522
What in the hell are you doin'?
I told you we weren't gettin' involved.

58:00.606 --> 58:03.650
You got us involved
when you brought us here.

58:04.401 --> 58:06.778
Now you hold on a minute, Virg.

58:06.862 --> 58:10.406
Hold on nothin'! I walk around this
town and look these people in the eye.

58:10.491 --> 58:13.034
It's just like someone's
slappin' me in the face.

58:13.119 --> 58:14.994
These people are afraid
to walk down the street,

58:15.079 --> 58:18.623
and I'm tryin' to make money off that
like some goddamn vulture!

58:18.707 --> 58:20.125
If we're gonna have
a future in this town,

58:20.209 --> 58:21.668
it's gotta have some law and order.

58:21.752 --> 58:24.129
Please, Virg, don't do this to me!

58:24.213 --> 58:26.172
It's got nothin' to do with you!
It's got to do with...

58:26.257 --> 58:27.465
Nothin' to do with me?

58:27.550 --> 58:30.718
I'm your brother, for Christ's sake!
God, I don't believe this!

58:30.803 --> 58:33.345
Talk to him, will you? Or hit him!

58:37.183 --> 58:39.643
Ah, God, don't tell me!

58:39.727 --> 58:42.020
Like you said, Wyatt, we're brothers.

58:42.105 --> 58:46.275
Gotta back your brother's play.
Just did like I figured you would.

58:46.860 --> 58:49.862
All right now,
you listen to me, both of ya!

58:52.073 --> 58:53.157
For the first time in our lives,

58:53.241 --> 58:55.826
we got a chance to stop wandering
and finally be a family.

58:55.910 --> 58:59.621
This is trouble we don't need.
You saw what happened to Fred White.

58:59.706 --> 59:02.082
We know what we're doin', Wyatt.

59:02.208 --> 59:05.836
Okay, fine. Say you're right,
say you don't get yourself killed.

59:05.920 --> 59:08.463
There's somethin' else.

59:08.548 --> 59:10.299
All those years I worked
those cow towns,

59:10.425 --> 59:14.178
I was only ever mixed up
in one shootin', just one.

59:14.262 --> 59:17.681
But a man lost his life, and I took it.

59:17.765 --> 59:20.517
You don't know how that feels, Morg.

59:20.602 --> 59:23.520
Believe me, boy,
you don't ever wanna know.

59:23.605 --> 59:25.564
Not ever.

59:33.489 --> 59:36.241
Didn't even make a dent, did I?

59:36.326 --> 59:37.993
All right.

59:39.662 --> 59:42.539
You're both makin' a big mistake.

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.516
Do you wanna ante?

01:00:01.601 --> 01:00:03.143
Yeah, fine.

01:00:28.669 --> 01:00:31.254
What do you think of the singer?

01:00:33.507 --> 01:00:35.007
Nice voice.

01:00:36.551 --> 01:00:40.846
Wyatt, Doc won't quit.
He's been at it for 36 hours straight.

01:00:41.515 --> 01:00:43.307
Clanton and the McLaury Brothers
came in an hour ago.

01:00:43.392 --> 01:00:45.309
I tried to get him to go to bed,
but he won't let go.

01:00:45.394 --> 01:00:48.229
I know, and nobody can make him.

01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:55.653
Wyatt, just in time. Pull up a chair.

01:00:57.406 --> 01:01:01.033
Doc, you been hittin' it
awful hard, haven't ya?

01:01:01.118 --> 01:01:05.413
Nonsense.
I've not yet begun to defile myself.

01:01:06.248 --> 01:01:07.540
I was wonderin' if maybe you wouldn't

01:01:07.624 --> 01:01:08.708
wanna go on over
to the Crystal Palace.

01:01:08.834 --> 01:01:11.544
I will not be pawed at,
thank you very much.

01:01:11.628 --> 01:01:13.504
- I'm sorry.
- That's right.

01:01:13.588 --> 01:01:16.549
Doc can go on day and night,
and then some.

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:22.722
That's my loving man.
Have another one, my loving man.

01:01:24.057 --> 01:01:25.641
I'm in.

01:01:27.853 --> 01:01:29.186
Hey.

01:01:29.271 --> 01:01:32.064
Loving man, you been called.

01:01:45.912 --> 01:01:47.455
What is that now?

01:01:47.539 --> 01:01:51.917
That 12 hands in a row, Holliday?
Son of a bitch, nobody's that lucky.

01:01:53.795 --> 01:01:56.756
Why, Ike, whatever do you mean?

01:01:58.425 --> 01:02:00.301
Take it easy, boys.

01:02:02.679 --> 01:02:05.431
Maybe poker's just not your game, Ike.

01:02:07.475 --> 01:02:11.102
I know, let's have a spelling contest.

01:02:11.187 --> 01:02:13.980
How 'bout if I just
wring your scrawny neck?

01:02:14.065 --> 01:02:15.607
Enough, Ike.

01:02:16.776 --> 01:02:19.235
Are you takin' his part?

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.946
I'm the one who got cheated!

01:02:22.073 --> 01:02:26.785
You goddamn pimps!
You're all in it together.

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:28.244
Nobody's in anything, Ike.

01:02:28.329 --> 01:02:30.246
You're drunk.
Go on home and sleep it off.

01:02:30.331 --> 01:02:32.999
Get your goddamn hands off me!

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:35.627
Don't you ever put
your hands on me, see?

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:37.545
Don't you ever try to
manhandle a Cowboy,

01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:39.381
'cause we'll cut your
goddamn pimp's heart out.

01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:40.548
You understand, you pimp?

01:02:40.633 --> 01:02:42.592
Don't you threaten me,
you little son of a bitch!

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:45.804
All right! All right!
Come on, easy, Virg, easy!

01:02:45.888 --> 01:02:48.515
You just go on home and
forget about it, huh, Ike?

01:02:48.641 --> 01:02:50.308
Come on, Virg.

01:02:51.352 --> 01:02:53.603
I ain't gonna forget nothin'.

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:57.148
Well, that certainly was a bust.

01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:02.404
Come, darlin'. Let's seek
our entertainment elsewhere.

01:03:03.739 --> 01:03:06.825
Forget it, Virg. Go on.
Get some fresh air.

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:22.257
- What's wrong, Doc?
- Nothin'. Not a thing.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.968
I'm right as the mail.

01:03:28.514 --> 01:03:30.473
Doc? Doc!

01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:34.269
All right, get him up.
Let's get him to the hotel.

01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:45.947
- What's wrong with him?
- Lunger.

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.199
Yeah, well, I hope you die.

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:51.244
Give me my guns.

01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:56.039
My rifle.

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:59.293
Goddamn bastards.
Think they can cheat me.

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:02.045
Nobody cheated you, Ike.
Just go home.

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:06.467
I don't take no mouth
from no bartenders, neither.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:07.843
There, ya see?

01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:12.264
Give somebody a rap on the beezer,
get some respect around here.

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:16.643
You tell the Earps, I see 'em
on the street and Doc Holliday,

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:20.397
I'm gonna send them to hell
on a shutter. You tell 'em that.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:28.238
Pick these guns up.

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:29.907
Come on.

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:47.633
Come on, Ike.

01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:49.843
Come on!

01:04:52.263 --> 01:04:55.098
- Hey, you walkin'?
- Leave me alone.

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:04.733
- You gonna give Ike back his guns.
- Not till he sobers up.

01:05:04.817 --> 01:05:07.528
Wearin' that badge
don't make you right.

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.947
Who the hell you think you are?

01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:16.036
Watch the way you walk,
you stupid bastard.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.121
Easy, kid, I'm sorry.

01:05:19.123 --> 01:05:21.333
I ain't easy and I ain't your kid.

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:24.461
You take your sorry
and shove it up your ass.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.716
I'll fight you right now.

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:37.975
Goddamn it!

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:40.560
You're gonna bleed.

01:05:40.644 --> 01:05:43.479
You got a fight comin'. Comin' today.

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:50.111
Bastards! It's comin'!

01:05:58.161 --> 01:06:00.663
Your condition's quite advanced.

01:06:00.747 --> 01:06:04.541
I'd say you lost some 60%
of your lung tissue, maybe more.

01:06:04.625 --> 01:06:06.376
What's the verdict?

01:06:06.502 --> 01:06:11.339
Two years. Two days.
Hard to say. If you stop now.

01:06:12.842 --> 01:06:16.845
Your smokin', your drinkin',
your gamblin', your nightlife.

01:06:16.971 --> 01:06:19.180
You need complete rest.

01:06:21.183 --> 01:06:25.145
What I mean is,
you must attempt to deny

01:06:25.229 --> 01:06:29.691
- your marital impulse.
- Get out of my sight.

01:06:48.544 --> 01:06:51.046
- How are you feeling, Doc?
- Better.

01:06:52.006 --> 01:06:53.965
That's good.

01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:56.051
I knew it wasn't nothing.

01:06:58.554 --> 01:07:00.472
We must talk, darlin'.

01:07:02.558 --> 01:07:05.018
It appears

01:07:05.102 --> 01:07:08.396
we must redefine the nature
of our association.

01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:16.571
I'm a good woman to you, Doc.

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:20.116
Don't I always take care of ya?

01:07:20.951 --> 01:07:23.286
Nobody cares for you like me.

01:07:24.246 --> 01:07:26.039
I'm a good woman.

01:07:27.874 --> 01:07:31.210
Yes, it's true, you are a good woman.

01:07:44.683 --> 01:07:46.517
Then again,

01:07:47.644 --> 01:07:49.937
you may be the Antichrist.

01:08:11.918 --> 01:08:13.335
Goddamn.

01:08:14.754 --> 01:08:18.631
Now there's six of 'em.
Hell, this is like a bad dream.

01:08:19.591 --> 01:08:22.845
Just stay calm. Use your head.
It'll be all right.

01:08:26.433 --> 01:08:28.600
Just the same, though,

01:08:30.812 --> 01:08:33.397
guess maybe you better swear me in.

01:09:08.265 --> 01:09:12.352
Those Cowboys been telling everybody
in town they're gonna clean you out.

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:15.897
They're back there in that lot
behind the O.K. Corral.

01:09:17.191 --> 01:09:19.192
- Thank you, Mayor.
- What're you doin' out of bed, Doc?

01:09:19.276 --> 01:09:22.779
What in the hell's goin' on?
Five people come up to my room

01:09:22.863 --> 01:09:25.740
tellin' me the Clantons and McLaurys
are gunnin' for us.

01:09:25.823 --> 01:09:28.826
We goin' down there or not?
What are we gonna do?

01:09:28.911 --> 01:09:30.787
Wait till the liquor wears off.

01:09:30.871 --> 01:09:33.456
Soon as they start gettin' headaches,
they'll lose interest.

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:36.082
Lose interest, hell.
They're threatenin' our lives.

01:09:36.210 --> 01:09:39.587
- You'll never make that stick.
- They're carryin' guns, Wyatt.

01:09:39.671 --> 01:09:41.631
Christ's sake, Virg,
that's a misdemeanour.

01:09:41.715 --> 01:09:43.466
You go down there and arrest them,
something goes wrong,

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:45.968
maybe this time somebody really
gets his head broken.

01:09:46.053 --> 01:09:47.636
You'll have Cowboys comin' around
lookin' for trouble

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.888
from here to Christmas.

01:09:48.971 --> 01:09:51.265
You want to risk all that
over a misdemeanour?

01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:54.560
Damn right I'll risk it.
They're breakin' the law.

01:10:01.026 --> 01:10:04.862
It's not your problem, Doc.
You don't have to mix up in this.

01:10:06.657 --> 01:10:09.909
That is a hell of a thing
for you to say to me.

01:10:21.421 --> 01:10:23.172
All right, Virg.

01:10:25.759 --> 01:10:28.344
Your call. Give Doc the shotgun.

01:10:30.222 --> 01:10:34.393
They'll be less apt to get nervy
if he's on the street howitzer.

01:11:19.854 --> 01:11:21.563
Go on! Get home!

01:11:23.566 --> 01:11:25.317
Goddamn kid.

01:11:37.204 --> 01:11:40.248
How the hell did we
get ourselves into this?

01:11:43.586 --> 01:11:45.045
You don't have to worry about a thing.

01:11:45.129 --> 01:11:46.379
I just went over there
and disarmed them.

01:11:46.464 --> 01:11:49.507
You did? Come on, boys.

01:11:49.592 --> 01:11:52.844
Gentlemen, I'm not
gonna allow any trouble.

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:18.703
We're here to disarm you.
Throw up your hands.

01:12:23.084 --> 01:12:25.627
Hold it! That's not what I want!

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.079
Oh, my God.

01:13:11.423 --> 01:13:13.424
Billy! Billy!

01:13:20.056 --> 01:13:22.474
Stop! No! No!

01:13:23.184 --> 01:13:25.686
Don't shoot! I got no gun!

01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:28.022
Please don't shoot me! I got no gun!

01:13:28.106 --> 01:13:31.442
This fight's commenced!
Get to fightin' or get away!

01:13:33.445 --> 01:13:35.362
- That's it!
- Shut the door!

01:13:50.837 --> 01:13:53.213
Give me your goddamned gun!
Damn it!

01:13:53.298 --> 01:13:55.549
Billy! Billy!

01:13:55.633 --> 01:13:57.468
Doc, behind us!

01:14:24.662 --> 01:14:27.206
I got you now, you son of a bitch.

01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:29.374
You're a daisy if you do.

01:14:43.764 --> 01:14:46.307
Morgan, hold quiet now.

01:14:57.361 --> 01:14:59.487
Here you go. Easy. Easy, man.

01:14:59.571 --> 01:15:02.323
- I got you. All right.
- All right!

01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:07.120
All of you are under arrest.

01:15:17.589 --> 01:15:20.925
I don't think I'll let you
arrest us today, Behan.

01:15:50.121 --> 01:15:52.122
Virg!

01:15:52.206 --> 01:15:53.999
Virgil!

01:16:14.729 --> 01:16:18.148
Well, I guess we did
our good deed for today, Mayor.

01:17:42.816 --> 01:17:45.859
You were right.
It's nothin' like I thought.

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:50.406
- I almost wish that...
- I know, Morgan.

01:17:51.741 --> 01:17:53.867
I know. Me too.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.007
Outta the way!

01:18:12.636 --> 01:18:14.220
Gettin' warmer.

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.223
Guess spring's comin'.

01:18:17.308 --> 01:18:19.559
Hello, Billy. I say hello.

01:18:19.643 --> 01:18:21.811
It's deputy!
And I don't want to talk to you!

01:18:21.895 --> 01:18:24.647
Those men you killed were my friends.

01:18:25.733 --> 01:18:28.109
I'm just a nothin'.
But if I wasn't, I'd fight you right now,

01:18:28.193 --> 01:18:30.570
so I don't want to talk to you.

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:35.241
All they ever did was laugh at him.

01:18:44.001 --> 01:18:47.170
Sister boy should've stuck around.

01:18:49.798 --> 01:18:53.509
- What do you want, Ringo?
- I want your blood.

01:18:55.137 --> 01:18:57.347
And I want your souls.

01:18:57.931 --> 01:19:00.308
And I want 'em both right now.

01:19:00.392 --> 01:19:03.895
- I don't want any more trouble.
- Well, ya got trouble!

01:19:06.231 --> 01:19:08.441
And it starts with you.

01:19:12.279 --> 01:19:14.822
I'm not gonna fight you, Ringo.

01:19:15.783 --> 01:19:17.784
There's no money in it.

01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:20.453
Sober up. Come on, boys.

01:19:20.954 --> 01:19:23.456
You wretched slugs.

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.958
Don't any of ya have the guts
to play for blood?

01:19:26.043 --> 01:19:28.127
I'm your huckleberry.

01:19:30.089 --> 01:19:32.048
That's just my game.

01:19:39.598 --> 01:19:43.309
All right, lunger. You go to hell.

01:19:44.978 --> 01:19:47.980
- I'll put you out of your misery.
- Say when.

01:19:48.816 --> 01:19:51.359
- Johnny, don't!
- No, Johnny!

01:19:52.904 --> 01:19:54.571
- Get off!
- Easy now!

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:56.197
- Get off!
- It ain't nothin'.

01:19:56.281 --> 01:19:59.158
Don't mind him!
He's just drunk, that's all.

01:20:02.162 --> 01:20:03.788
Cool down, Johnny!

01:20:03.872 --> 01:20:06.082
No! No!

01:20:07.084 --> 01:20:09.293
I want them spittin' blood!

01:20:09.378 --> 01:20:11.879
Easy, son, easy! Now ain't the time!

01:20:11.964 --> 01:20:13.631
Slow down, Ringo.

01:20:16.009 --> 01:20:17.844
I tell ya, boys, even I'm worried
what's gonna happen

01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:19.470
once Ringo runs this outfit.

01:20:19.555 --> 01:20:22.306
God have mercy!

01:20:22.391 --> 01:20:25.435
- Juanito, their time will come.
- Gentlemen.

01:20:26.228 --> 01:20:28.896
- Let's go get bullied, boy!
- Let's go get soused!

01:20:29.022 --> 01:20:31.065
- Barber.
- Yes, sir?

01:20:34.153 --> 01:20:35.695
Proceed, sir.

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:55.589
Listen to me. I need to speak with you.

01:20:56.382 --> 01:20:58.091
Not now. I'm busy.

01:20:59.635 --> 01:21:02.179
I see what's going on
between you and Wyatt.

01:21:02.263 --> 01:21:04.931
I'm not a fool. But listen to me.

01:21:06.058 --> 01:21:08.727
Lots of so-called hard cases
and tough nuts

01:21:08.853 --> 01:21:10.228
come and go around this town,

01:21:10.313 --> 01:21:14.524
but none of them has a clue
about the real play, none of them.

01:21:14.609 --> 01:21:18.570
Now after tonight, there'll be one man
in charge of Tombstone.

01:21:18.654 --> 01:21:21.448
You'll be happy to know him. Bet on it.

01:21:31.417 --> 01:21:33.710
Gonna be one of those nights.

01:21:36.881 --> 01:21:39.549
It's gettin' late, boys.
I'm gonna go to bed.

01:21:39.634 --> 01:21:42.302
- Good night, Virg.
- Good night, Morg.

01:21:43.887 --> 01:21:46.972
Bundle up, Virg.
It's gettin' cold out there.

01:21:47.098 --> 01:21:48.224
Yeah.

01:22:15.502 --> 01:22:17.461
Tower of Babel.

01:22:18.213 --> 01:22:20.631
Death and the Devil.

01:22:20.715 --> 01:22:21.715
Oh, dear.

01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:24.635
Oh, Allie. I wish you'd learn to play
a real card game.

01:22:29.474 --> 01:22:32.309
- More tea, Mattie?
- No, no.

01:22:32.394 --> 01:22:34.311
- Are you all right, Mattie?
- Yes.

01:22:34.396 --> 01:22:37.064
- Are you expecting someone?
- Only Virg.

01:22:42.279 --> 01:22:45.990
Please. I know it's awful
to come here, but listen.

01:22:46.074 --> 01:22:48.867
I think something's
gonna happen tonight.

01:22:50.996 --> 01:22:53.205
It's Virg.

01:22:53.331 --> 01:22:54.999
No! Get down!

01:23:13.643 --> 01:23:16.145
That thunder's sure gettin' close.

01:23:28.199 --> 01:23:31.159
Virgil. What'd ya forget?

01:23:42.212 --> 01:23:43.713
Wyatt.

01:23:56.727 --> 01:23:59.687
Will you hurry with that water, please?

01:23:59.772 --> 01:24:01.939
Come on, Lou.

01:24:05.402 --> 01:24:07.362
Wyatt! Wyatt!

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.158
They hit Clum's house too,
shot up his wife.

01:24:12.242 --> 01:24:14.410
His wife! Whoever heard of that?

01:24:14.495 --> 01:24:17.664
They're bugs, Wyatt. All that
smart talk about live and let live.

01:24:17.748 --> 01:24:19.332
There ain't no live
and let live with bugs.

01:24:19.416 --> 01:24:22.085
All right, you listen to me now.
We gotta get out of here.

01:24:22.169 --> 01:24:25.463
Get out of here?
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.

01:24:25.547 --> 01:24:28.132
Lie down and crawl or you might
get hurt? What kind of talk is that?

01:24:28.217 --> 01:24:30.426
- Do you see what's happening here?
- What?

01:24:30.552 --> 01:24:33.513
What do you mean?
What are you saying?

01:24:33.597 --> 01:24:35.431
No. Please, no.

01:24:35.516 --> 01:24:39.394
I'm afraid your husband's
going to lose the use of his arm.

01:24:39.478 --> 01:24:41.562
Oh, God, no.

01:24:43.607 --> 01:24:45.650
Don't worry, Allie girl.

01:24:45.734 --> 01:24:48.611
I still got one good arm
to hold you with.

01:24:50.864 --> 01:24:51.864
Goddamn!

01:24:51.949 --> 01:24:56.536
- Goddamn sons of bitches!
- Morgan, wait a minute! Virg.

01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:59.497
- You had to be so damn smart.
- I'm sorry, Allie.

01:24:59.581 --> 01:25:01.124
I told you, Virg.

01:25:01.208 --> 01:25:03.751
- Not now, Wyatt.
- All right.

01:25:03.836 --> 01:25:05.878
All right, what do you want me to do?

01:25:05.963 --> 01:25:09.799
- Just leave me alone, for God's sakes.
- Virg...

01:25:09.883 --> 01:25:12.635
He doesn't want to talk now, Wyatt!

01:25:29.818 --> 01:25:32.820
I heard about what they did
to your women. That was wrong.

01:25:32.904 --> 01:25:37.074
I'm here to let you know that it
wasn't me. I had no part of it.

01:25:37.159 --> 01:25:41.579
No? Brothers to the bone,
right, McMasters?

01:25:41.663 --> 01:25:45.374
No. Not any more. Not after this night.

01:25:46.668 --> 01:25:50.504
He's right, Wyatt. You want us
for anything, we're with you.

01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:52.006
Come on.

01:26:55.654 --> 01:26:57.655
Hold him!

01:26:59.241 --> 01:27:01.700
No! Get her out of here! Jesus!

01:27:03.078 --> 01:27:05.578
Somebody shut that dog up!

01:27:09.416 --> 01:27:11.292
I said hold him, goddamn it!

01:27:11.377 --> 01:27:14.754
Somebody get
that goddamn dog out of here!

01:27:14.839 --> 01:27:17.423
The bullet's too deep. I can't get it out.

01:27:20.177 --> 01:27:22.971
The way it's lodged in there. I'm sorry.

01:27:23.055 --> 01:27:25.431
Easy, Morg. Is that better?

01:27:26.851 --> 01:27:28.101
Yeah.

01:27:31.355 --> 01:27:35.066
You were right, Wyatt.
They got me good.

01:27:37.862 --> 01:27:41.072
Don't let 'em get you, brother.
You're the one.

01:27:42.491 --> 01:27:43.950
Easy, Morg.

01:27:45.786 --> 01:27:47.912
Don't worry about that now.

01:27:52.793 --> 01:27:56.087
Remember what I said
about seein' a light when you're dyin'?

01:27:56.714 --> 01:27:58.965
Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:59.717 --> 01:28:01.718
That ain't true.

01:28:01.802 --> 01:28:04.095
I can't see a damn thing.

01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:09.100
Morg?

01:28:13.981 --> 01:28:15.231
Morg!

01:28:21.572 --> 01:28:22.989
Morg?

01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:39.005
No.

01:28:41.759 --> 01:28:43.718
Morgan! No!

01:28:43.802 --> 01:28:47.555
Morgan, don't die! I love you!

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.724
Don't die!

01:29:02.445 --> 01:29:05.530
Why? Why him?

01:29:09.243 --> 01:29:13.498
- No. No, get away from me!
- Wyatt!

01:29:14.375 --> 01:29:17.251
Can't you see? Get away from me!

01:29:52.705 --> 01:29:54.330
Morgan!

01:30:46.214 --> 01:30:49.133
And so she walked
out of our lives forever.

01:31:25.003 --> 01:31:27.338
I want you to know it's over.

01:31:29.508 --> 01:31:30.841
Well.

01:31:33.011 --> 01:31:34.345
Bye.

01:31:36.348 --> 01:31:38.307
You smell that, Bill?

01:31:40.519 --> 01:31:42.686
Smells like someone died.

01:31:44.439 --> 01:31:46.148
Jesus, Johnny.

01:32:09.798 --> 01:32:11.173
Ike.

01:32:12.843 --> 01:32:17.096
Take Stillwell and finish it.

01:32:32.111 --> 01:32:34.529
Now, you take care of yourself.

01:32:35.739 --> 01:32:38.908
- That's Virgil with the women.
- He's mine!

01:32:39.034 --> 01:32:42.662
- All aboard!
- Hey, Mattie! Where's Wyatt?

01:32:42.746 --> 01:32:44.956
Right behind you, Stillwell.

01:32:46.333 --> 01:32:47.750
No!

01:33:02.391 --> 01:33:04.350
Sweet Jesus. Don't shoot.

01:33:22.786 --> 01:33:24.913
All right, Clanton.

01:33:24.997 --> 01:33:28.416
You called down the thunder.
Well, now you got it.

01:33:31.003 --> 01:33:34.464
You see that?
It says "United States Marshal."

01:33:34.548 --> 01:33:37.383
Wyatt. Please don't kill me. Please.

01:33:37.468 --> 01:33:41.721
Take a good look at him, Ike,
'cause that's how you're gonna end up.

01:33:43.432 --> 01:33:46.476
The Cowboys are finished.
You understand me?

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:50.063
I see a red sash,
I kill the man wearin' it.

01:33:50.147 --> 01:33:52.148
So run, you cur.

01:33:52.983 --> 01:33:56.986
Run! Tell all the other curs
the law is comin'!

01:33:58.447 --> 01:34:00.323
You tell 'em I'm comin'!

01:34:00.407 --> 01:34:03.368
And Hell's comin' with me, you hear?

01:34:03.452 --> 01:34:05.495
Hell's comin' with me!

01:34:39.362 --> 01:34:41.196
Nobody move!

01:34:41.281 --> 01:34:43.907
Nonsense. By all means, move.

01:36:00.232 --> 01:36:01.775
Get down!

01:36:13.913 --> 01:36:15.580
Hey, Wyatt!

01:36:15.664 --> 01:36:17.791
How the hell are ya?

01:36:30.054 --> 01:36:32.430
I got some boys over there behind ya!

01:36:32.515 --> 01:36:35.850
Got you in a little crossfire.
How do ya like that?

01:36:38.187 --> 01:36:41.147
Come on!
Think of something fast, would ya?

01:36:43.776 --> 01:36:47.195
Wyatt? Hey, Wyatt.

01:36:47.988 --> 01:36:49.864
- No.
- Wyatt!

01:36:51.867 --> 01:36:54.244
- No.
- Wyatt, what are you doin'?

01:36:55.204 --> 01:36:56.663
Look at that.

01:36:57.331 --> 01:36:58.706
Yeah.

01:36:59.667 --> 01:37:02.043
Come and get some, boy.

01:37:06.715 --> 01:37:08.800
No! Let me!

01:37:16.225 --> 01:37:17.642
No.

01:37:17.852 --> 01:37:21.646
- Son of a bitch.
- No!

01:37:26.569 --> 01:37:28.403
Jesus Christ!

01:37:39.039 --> 01:37:41.749
No. No!

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:56.430
Did you ever see anything
like that before?

01:37:56.514 --> 01:37:58.891
Hell, I ain't never even
heard of anything like that.

01:37:58.975 --> 01:38:00.309
Nothin'.

01:38:01.227 --> 01:38:02.811
Where is he?

01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:07.149
Down by the creek,

01:38:07.233 --> 01:38:09.109
walkin' on water.

01:38:09.194 --> 01:38:12.446
Well, let's hope he's got
another miracle up his sleeve.

01:38:12.572 --> 01:38:16.158
'Cause if I know Ringo,
he's headed straight for us.

01:38:17.702 --> 01:38:21.246
Well, if they were my brothers,
I'd want revenge too.

01:38:21.331 --> 01:38:23.332
No. Make no mistake.

01:38:24.918 --> 01:38:27.252
It's not revenge he's after.

01:38:28.755 --> 01:38:30.715
It's a reckoning.

01:38:41.143 --> 01:38:45.605
Doc. You ought to be in bed. What
the hell you doin' this for anyway?

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.441
Wyatt Earp is my friend.

01:38:49.777 --> 01:38:52.111
Hell, I got lots of friends.

01:38:53.656 --> 01:38:55.073
I don't.

01:39:14.927 --> 01:39:16.469
My God.

01:39:19.557 --> 01:39:22.225
- Are you all right?
- What do you care?

01:39:23.185 --> 01:39:25.520
It was your friends that did it.

01:39:27.147 --> 01:39:30.984
Must've been Claiborne and Fuller.
They left here last night.

01:39:31.985 --> 01:39:33.777
Oh, no.

01:39:33.861 --> 01:39:36.488
They tried to take my watch.

01:39:36.573 --> 01:39:39.658
He cursed them for cowards,
and they shot him.

01:39:41.244 --> 01:39:43.787
I don't understand any of this.

01:39:45.415 --> 01:39:47.416
I just know it's ugly.

01:39:48.042 --> 01:39:49.835
You're all ugly,

01:39:50.587 --> 01:39:52.754
and he was beautiful.

01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:58.844
He tried to bring something fine into
your ugly world, and you shot him for it.

01:40:02.973 --> 01:40:05.016
Not that you care.

01:40:16.445 --> 01:40:19.405
- Billy. Where you goin'?
- I'm not goin' with you.

01:40:19.489 --> 01:40:21.782
Billy! Billy, get back here!

01:40:21.867 --> 01:40:24.368
I'm sorry, sir,
but we got to have some law.

01:40:24.453 --> 01:40:27.413
- Billy!
- Let him go. Who cares?

01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:31.500
Get on out!
Get the hell outta here! Go on!

01:40:32.252 --> 01:40:34.670
Party's over, boys. Let's go!

01:40:49.936 --> 01:40:51.187
Halt.

01:40:57.736 --> 01:41:00.446
Ringo and Behan are out in front.

01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:03.407
There is about 30 of 'em.

01:41:05.744 --> 01:41:07.912
They're all wearin' badges.

01:41:09.414 --> 01:41:10.915
Christ.

01:41:11.917 --> 01:41:14.418
We gotta find a place to hole up.

01:41:16.004 --> 01:41:17.254
Doc.

01:41:18.006 --> 01:41:19.923
Grab him.

01:41:22.301 --> 01:41:23.635
I got him.

01:41:24.887 --> 01:41:26.429
I got him!

01:41:32.645 --> 01:41:34.312
Is this Henry Hooker's ranch?

01:41:34.438 --> 01:41:37.273
That's right. And I'm Hooker.

01:41:37.358 --> 01:41:39.609
We got a sick man.

01:41:39.694 --> 01:41:41.945
And our horses are done in.

01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:45.615
Put him up at my place,
as long as it's just tonight.

01:41:46.659 --> 01:41:48.451
We're in debt to you.

01:41:56.794 --> 01:41:58.795
I know you boys
have got to keep movin',

01:41:58.879 --> 01:42:01.214
but he looks pretty bad to me.

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:32.036
They got held up,
and their boss actor got killed.

01:42:32.163 --> 01:42:35.832
They came here to water the horses,
then they'll push on.

01:42:52.683 --> 01:42:56.644
I'm sorry about your friend.
And I'm sorry that I...

01:42:57.104 --> 01:42:59.731
I forgave you the moment you said it.

01:42:59.815 --> 01:43:02.525
You did? Well...

01:43:04.737 --> 01:43:06.069
Thank you.

01:43:07.530 --> 01:43:09.114
All set.

01:43:11.534 --> 01:43:13.076
I have to go.

01:43:16.414 --> 01:43:17.873
Wait.

01:44:04.504 --> 01:44:06.421
What the hell is that?

01:44:26.609 --> 01:44:28.443
They got McMasters!

01:44:31.739 --> 01:44:35.492
Ringo wanted to make sure
he got your attention, Marshal!

01:44:35.577 --> 01:44:37.536
He wants a straight-up fight,
just you and him,

01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:39.872
to settle this thing once and for all.

01:44:39.956 --> 01:44:43.500
Oak grove at the mouth
of Silver Springs Canyon, 7:00!

01:44:43.585 --> 01:44:46.211
You tell him I'll be there!

01:44:46.296 --> 01:44:48.755
- Are you crazy?
- I'll be there!

01:44:50.841 --> 01:44:52.425
It's not finished.

01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:11.359
After I'm done with Wyatt Earp,

01:45:11.485 --> 01:45:15.405
take your Cowboys and finish off
Creek Johnson and Texas Jack.

01:45:17.325 --> 01:45:19.326
You burn 'em, Ike.

01:45:21.787 --> 01:45:22.996
Burn 'em all.

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:25.874
Hell, Johnny,
he ain't even gonna show.

01:45:28.711 --> 01:45:30.211
He'll show.

01:45:33.507 --> 01:45:37.552
I spent my whole life not knowin'
what I wanted outta life,

01:45:38.095 --> 01:45:40.138
just chasin' my tail.

01:45:40.556 --> 01:45:44.100
Now for the first time
I know exactly what I want,

01:45:44.185 --> 01:45:45.560
and who.

01:45:47.897 --> 01:45:50.774
And that's the damnable misery of it.

01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:57.989
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc?

01:45:58.074 --> 01:46:01.076
What makes him
do the things he does?

01:46:01.202 --> 01:46:03.203
A man like Ringo

01:46:04.372 --> 01:46:08.208
got a great empty hole
right through the middle of him.

01:46:10.211 --> 01:46:14.464
He can never kill enough
or steal enough

01:46:14.548 --> 01:46:17.384
or inflict enough pain to ever fill it.

01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:20.220
What does he need?

01:46:21.472 --> 01:46:23.390
Revenge.

01:46:26.811 --> 01:46:28.228
For what?

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:35.777
Bein' born.

01:46:50.458 --> 01:46:52.209
It all happened so fast with Curly Bill

01:46:52.293 --> 01:46:53.669
I didn't really have time
to think about it,

01:46:53.753 --> 01:46:57.047
but I've had plenty of time
to think about this.

01:47:03.930 --> 01:47:06.181
I can't beat him, can I?

01:47:07.892 --> 01:47:09.101
No.

01:47:16.526 --> 01:47:19.486
Wait. I'm goin' with ya.

01:47:25.994 --> 01:47:29.413
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

01:47:30.331 --> 01:47:32.499
I'm sorry, Wyatt.

01:47:32.584 --> 01:47:34.752
It's all right, Doc.

01:47:38.465 --> 01:47:41.050
What's it like to wear one of those?

01:48:08.412 --> 01:48:09.913
Don't worry.

01:48:09.997 --> 01:48:13.208
They want him,
they gotta come over us first.

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:44.488
He's waitin' for you by the big oak,
quarter mile up that trail.

01:48:50.370 --> 01:48:53.205
They're not givin' ya any safe-conduct.

01:48:53.915 --> 01:48:57.960
Shootin' starts, you better kick east
to the New Mexico line.

01:49:00.672 --> 01:49:02.714
I ain't got the words.

01:49:02.841 --> 01:49:04.716
I know.

01:49:05.385 --> 01:49:06.885
Me neither.

01:49:15.562 --> 01:49:17.146
Well.

01:49:23.778 --> 01:49:26.321
I didn't think ya had it in you.

01:49:26.406 --> 01:49:28.490
I'm your huckleberry.

01:49:32.162 --> 01:49:34.663
Why, Johnny Ringo,

01:49:35.498 --> 01:49:38.876
you look like somebody
just walked over your grave.

01:49:40.753 --> 01:49:43.045
Fight's not with you, Holliday.

01:49:43.130 --> 01:49:47.800
I'll beg to differ, sir. We started
a game we never got to finish.

01:49:48.927 --> 01:49:51.345
Play for blood, remember?

01:49:53.557 --> 01:49:55.600
I was just foolin' about.

01:49:57.686 --> 01:49:59.312
I wasn't.

01:50:00.856 --> 01:50:03.065
And this time

01:50:04.109 --> 01:50:05.651
it's legal.

01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:17.329
All right, lunger. Let's do it.

01:50:51.948 --> 01:50:53.406
Say when.

01:51:12.218 --> 01:51:14.761
Come on. Come on!

01:51:15.763 --> 01:51:17.555
Oh, Johnny. Come on!

01:51:23.771 --> 01:51:26.856
You're no daisy. You're no daisy at all!

01:51:28.526 --> 01:51:30.026
Poor soul.

01:51:31.362 --> 01:51:33.780
You were just too high-strung.

01:51:44.458 --> 01:51:47.919
I'm afraid the strain
was more than he could bear.

01:51:55.803 --> 01:51:59.222
Oh, I wasn't quite
as sick as I made out.

01:52:03.601 --> 01:52:05.185
Good God.

01:52:11.901 --> 01:52:13.902
My hypocrisy goes only so far.

01:52:19.659 --> 01:52:21.076
All right.

01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:23.662
Let's finish it.

01:52:23.747 --> 01:52:28.334
Indeed, sir. The last charge
of Wyatt Earp and his immortals.

01:53:21.471 --> 01:53:23.597
Come on! Get going!

01:53:28.686 --> 01:53:30.354
Look at this!

01:54:51.893 --> 01:54:53.477
Hello, Wyatt.

01:54:54.061 --> 01:54:56.438
Father Feeney and I were just

01:54:57.356 --> 01:55:01.193
investigating the mysteries
of the Church of Rome.

01:55:03.070 --> 01:55:08.033
It appears my hypocrisy
knows no bounds.

01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:12.621
You're no hypocrite, Doc.
You just like to sound like one.

01:55:13.331 --> 01:55:15.582
I brought you somethin'.

01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:25.258
Well, let's see. Where are we today?

01:55:25.384 --> 01:55:28.345
I'm $17 down to you.

01:55:28.429 --> 01:55:32.349
- Two bits a hand. Stud?
- You keep comin' back here.

01:55:32.433 --> 01:55:35.434
I told you not to, and I meant it.

01:55:35.519 --> 01:55:39.104
You're the only person
I can afford to lose to any more.

01:55:41.358 --> 01:55:43.526
How we feelin' today, Doc?

01:55:44.903 --> 01:55:46.987
I'm dying. How are you?

01:55:47.948 --> 01:55:49.823
Pretty much the same.

01:55:50.575 --> 01:55:53.202
So now we add self-pity
to your list of frailties.

01:55:53.286 --> 01:55:54.870
All right, Doc.

01:55:54.955 --> 01:55:57.623
All right, how many cards you want?

01:55:58.291 --> 01:56:00.626
I don't want to play any more.

01:56:02.295 --> 01:56:04.046
How many?

01:56:04.548 --> 01:56:07.967
Damn you. You're the most fallible,

01:56:09.886 --> 01:56:12.555
stubborn, self-deluded,

01:56:12.639 --> 01:56:14.974
bull-headed man
I've ever known in my entire life.

01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:16.433
I call.

01:56:17.227 --> 01:56:19.186
- You win.
- Yet withal,

01:56:19.729 --> 01:56:24.275
you're the only human being in my
entire life who ever gave me hope.

01:56:30.824 --> 01:56:33.492
I was in love once.

01:56:35.495 --> 01:56:37.246
My first cousin.

01:56:37.872 --> 01:56:40.332
She was 15.

01:56:43.503 --> 01:56:45.212
We were both so...

01:56:46.631 --> 01:56:48.632
That's good, Doc.

01:56:49.426 --> 01:56:51.635
That's good. What happened?

01:56:55.181 --> 01:56:58.183
She joined a convent over the affair.

01:56:59.019 --> 01:57:01.395
She was all I ever wanted.

01:57:03.898 --> 01:57:06.025
What did you want?

01:57:06.651 --> 01:57:08.903
Just to live a normal life.

01:57:09.697 --> 01:57:13.199
There's no normal life, Wyatt.
There's just life.

01:57:14.577 --> 01:57:16.578
Now get on with it.

01:57:17.496 --> 01:57:19.039
Don't know how.

01:57:21.416 --> 01:57:24.251
Sure you do. Say goodbye to me.

01:57:26.254 --> 01:57:28.714
Go grab that spirited actress

01:57:28.798 --> 01:57:30.674
and make her your own.

01:57:32.093 --> 01:57:35.429
Take that beauty and run,
and don't look back.

01:57:35.513 --> 01:57:39.308
Live every second.
Live right up to the hilt.

01:57:40.226 --> 01:57:42.144
Live, Wyatt.

01:57:43.063 --> 01:57:44.730
Live for me.

01:57:46.566 --> 01:57:49.401
Wyatt, if you ever were my friend,

01:57:49.486 --> 01:57:52.905
if you ever had even
the slightest feelin' for me,

01:57:52.989 --> 01:57:54.531
leave now.

01:57:55.116 --> 01:57:56.617
Leave now.

01:58:01.498 --> 01:58:02.998
Please?

01:58:15.178 --> 01:58:17.763
Thanks for always bein' there, Doc.

01:58:45.959 --> 01:58:47.710
I'll be damned.

01:58:50.463 --> 01:58:52.131
This is funny.

01:59:12.735 --> 01:59:15.319
I never thought I would see
Gilbert and Sullivan performed

01:59:15.404 --> 01:59:17.321
right here in Denver.

01:59:18.657 --> 01:59:20.992
- Good night, Josie.
- Good night.

01:59:21.785 --> 01:59:23.326
Good show.

01:59:40.178 --> 01:59:43.263
Ya ever see the sun come up
over the Rockies?

01:59:43.848 --> 01:59:47.392
It hits all of a sudden,
and below there's California.

01:59:48.603 --> 01:59:51.354
And you swear
you're lookin' at heaven.

01:59:59.197 --> 02:00:01.573
I have nothing left,

02:00:01.699 --> 02:00:03.867
nothing to give you.

02:00:04.827 --> 02:00:08.163
I have no pride, no dignity.

02:00:09.415 --> 02:00:13.210
No money. I don't even know
how we'll make a living, but...

02:00:18.216 --> 02:00:21.218
I promise I'll love you
the rest of your life.

02:00:36.234 --> 02:00:39.903
Don't worry, Wyatt. My family's rich.

02:00:47.286 --> 02:00:49.788
What shall we do first?

02:00:49.872 --> 02:00:53.041
What you wanted to do
the first night we met.

02:00:53.125 --> 02:00:54.501
Remember?

02:00:57.462 --> 02:00:59.672
May I have this dance?

02:01:01.758 --> 02:01:05.219
- Yes.
- And then we'll have room service.

02:01:12.602 --> 02:01:16.146
The power of the Cowboy Gang
was broken forever.

02:01:16.231 --> 02:01:18.732
Ike Clanton was shot and killed
two years later

02:01:18.817 --> 02:01:21.026
during an attempted robbery.

02:01:21.111 --> 02:01:25.698
Mattie died of a drug overdose
shortly after she left Tombstone.

02:01:25.782 --> 02:01:28.951
Virgil and Allie Earp
moved to California, where Virgil,

02:01:29.077 --> 02:01:32.663
despite the use of only one arm,
became a town sheriff.

02:01:33.081 --> 02:01:36.709
Wyatt and Josephine
embarked on a series of adventures.

02:01:36.793 --> 02:01:42.256
Up or down, thin or flush, in 47 years
they never left each other's side.

02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:45.634
Wyatt Earp died
in Los Angeles in 1929.

02:01:46.303 --> 02:01:48.304
Among the pallbearers at his funeral

02:01:48.388 --> 02:01:52.266
were early Western movie stars
William S. Hart and Tom Mix.

02:01:52.897 --> 02:01:54.922
Tom Mix wept.
