00:00.352 --> 00:02.085
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...

00:02.086 --> 00:03.842
HIDDEN ONE: <i>By sundown tomorrow,</i>

00:03.843 --> 00:06.609
I will be the one true God.

00:06.610 --> 00:08.578
You love these humans

00:08.579 --> 00:10.208
so much, then you

00:10.209 --> 00:11.843
shall die among them.

00:11.844 --> 00:13.211
I need the rest of the Box.

00:13.212 --> 00:14.480
It is the only thing

00:14.481 --> 00:15.481
that will stop him.

00:15.482 --> 00:16.615
CRANE: But...

00:16.616 --> 00:18.150
the Box can only be regenerated

00:18.151 --> 00:20.319
in the Catacombs.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.154
You fight monsters,

00:22.155 --> 00:23.422
then you save the world.

00:26.525 --> 00:29.228
CRANE: Betsy always said that the
flag was her greatest achievement.

00:29.229 --> 00:30.829
Somehow, it allowed them

00:30.830 --> 00:32.164
to enter the Catacombs.

00:36.002 --> 00:37.636
Are you ready to go back, Lieutenant?

00:40.707 --> 00:41.974
Let's go.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.209 --> 01:17.976
Not too terrible.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.983
Really, Crane?

01:27.387 --> 01:28.921
You know I quit coffee.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.389
You were forced to abandon

01:30.390 --> 01:32.224
the pleasures of the caffeinated bean

01:32.225 --> 01:33.959
during your stay in the Catacombs,

01:33.960 --> 01:35.728
but you and I both know...

01:37.664 --> 01:39.531
your strong desire...

01:41.067 --> 01:44.236
for the cappuccino con doppio caffé.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.807
We cannot hide who we
truly are, Lieutenant,

01:48.808 --> 01:51.844
and if you and I are to

01:51.845 --> 01:53.245
yet again face

01:53.246 --> 01:54.909
the possibility of the
end of the world...

01:54.910 --> 01:56.281
we should embrace

01:56.282 --> 01:59.351
the fruits of life with a full heart.

01:59.352 --> 02:02.354
How true.

02:04.090 --> 02:05.324
What's this?

02:08.961 --> 02:11.163
(sniffing)

02:11.164 --> 02:12.264
Bacon?

02:12.265 --> 02:14.833
With...

02:14.834 --> 02:18.404
maple and a hint of Meyer lemon.

02:18.405 --> 02:20.272
(sniffing)

02:22.776 --> 02:24.810
- Bourbon?
- Mm-hmm.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.179
New gourmet donut shop
opened up downtown.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.748
I wanted to surprise you.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.787
(moans)

02:34.788 --> 02:36.455
(laughs)

02:36.456 --> 02:39.158
Manna from heaven.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.628
Yeah, seeing as how we are
going back to the Catacombs...

02:42.629 --> 02:44.763
and it's the closest
thing I can think of...

02:46.700 --> 02:49.301
...to Hell...

02:49.302 --> 02:51.503
you bet your ass I'm gonna drink this.

02:57.477 --> 02:59.044
Oh.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.245
That's good.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.415
You got a little something...

03:03.416 --> 03:04.850
Oh.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.752
(laughs)

03:10.056 --> 03:11.056
Lieutenant...

03:11.057 --> 03:12.691
Oh.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.527
Yes.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.029
I'm scared out of my mind

03:17.030 --> 03:19.398
of seeing that place again,

03:19.399 --> 03:22.100
and no, I'm not letting
you go without me.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.304
Whatever you do, I do.

03:26.239 --> 03:27.506
That's the deal.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.077
Truth bomb if ever I heard one.

03:32.078 --> 03:33.545
(laughs)

03:33.546 --> 03:35.013
Okay.

03:35.014 --> 03:36.357
Oh, I do that very well, don't I?

03:36.358 --> 03:37.883
(laughing)

03:37.884 --> 03:39.787
JENNY: <i>I'm sorry, but this
does not work for me.</i>

03:39.788 --> 03:40.686
JOE: Me neither.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.354
We've been down this road before.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.856
She's gonna work really hard to gain

03:43.857 --> 03:45.758
our confidence,
and then screw us over again

03:45.759 --> 03:47.526
for her megalomaniac boyfriend.

03:47.527 --> 03:50.562
The Hidden One is my husband.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.965
Or was. Since he cast me out,

03:52.966 --> 03:55.100
I am now nothing more

03:55.101 --> 03:57.069
than one of billions he will slaughter

03:57.070 --> 03:59.037
once he achieves omnipotence.

03:59.038 --> 04:00.305
CRANE: Which is why we must

04:00.306 --> 04:02.474
allow bygones to be precisely that.

04:02.475 --> 04:04.498
No, you know what, Crane,
I'm with "J" on this one.

04:04.499 --> 04:07.146
You spent months killing
and terrorizing people,

04:07.147 --> 04:08.580
so, no, I'm definitely not over it.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.250
It matters very little
if you trust me or not.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.218
My only wish is

04:13.219 --> 04:15.687
to save this world from annihilation.

04:15.688 --> 04:17.221
(door opens)

04:17.223 --> 04:18.524
REYNOLDS: Is now a good time

04:18.524 --> 04:19.625
to join the team?

04:27.934 --> 04:29.268
Join up

04:29.269 --> 04:30.972
- just like that?
- I guess I could pretend

04:30.973 --> 04:32.374
like I never saw what I saw.

04:34.307 --> 04:35.374
Oh, God.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.609
Go back to my normal life,

04:37.610 --> 04:40.212
but I'm guessing that isn't an option.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.381
I'm just here to help.

04:42.382 --> 04:45.417
This is not something
that you just rush into.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.001
If the world is hanging in the balance,

04:47.002 --> 04:48.821
I need to do everything I can to help.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.222
In for a penny, right?

04:52.158 --> 04:55.861
- It's an expression.
- (laughs) I know, yes.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.629
If anything happened to you,

04:57.630 --> 04:59.133
I wouldn't be able to forgive myself.

04:59.134 --> 05:01.366
This is where I want to be.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.834
Here for you.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.877
After all this is over, you and I

05:11.878 --> 05:14.947
are going back to that house
on Virginia Beach.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.349
Make up for some lost time.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.284
I'm gonna hold you to that.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.554
Welcome aboard.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.426
Eight hours, that's all we have left

05:27.427 --> 05:29.428
until the sands run
out of the Hourglass.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.997
When it does, the Hidden One
will become omnipotent.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.433
When-when you say omnipotent...

05:34.434 --> 05:37.769
He will possess the total power
of the pantheon of Ancient Gods.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.037
Enough to destroy

05:39.038 --> 05:40.973
every living thing in this world.

05:40.974 --> 05:41.974
CRANE: Our plan involves

05:41.975 --> 05:43.375
a two-pronged strategy...

05:43.376 --> 05:44.676
the lieutenant and I

05:44.677 --> 05:46.068
will journey to the Delaware River

05:46.069 --> 05:46.852
where we should use

05:46.853 --> 05:47.946
Betsy Ross's flag

05:47.947 --> 05:49.648
to guide us to the Catacombs.

05:49.649 --> 05:52.851
Once there,
we will restore Pandora's box

05:52.852 --> 05:54.519
and use it to drain
the Hidden One of his power.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.863
ABBIE: Meanwhile, the rest of you

05:55.864 --> 05:57.356
will do your damndest to delay him.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.224
Slow him down by any means necessary.

05:59.225 --> 06:01.026
I know this is my first rodeo,

06:01.027 --> 06:02.427
but we seem very short

06:02.428 --> 06:04.429
on actual Intel on this
Hidden One, and why

06:04.430 --> 06:06.431
the both of you need to
go back to the Catacombs.

06:06.432 --> 06:09.434
It can only be restored
if both of the Witnesses

06:09.435 --> 06:10.978
are present in the Temple of the Gods.

06:10.979 --> 06:13.438
If only one of them goes,

06:13.439 --> 06:14.973
the mission will fail.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.508
JENNY: As in, you're not going?

06:16.509 --> 06:18.443
It's your Box!

06:18.444 --> 06:20.145
Pandora has provided us

06:20.146 --> 06:21.813
with detailed instructions

06:21.814 --> 06:23.882
how to access the antechamber
within the temple.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.746
While she stays conveniently
out of harm's way.

06:25.747 --> 06:28.687
None of you stand a chance

06:28.688 --> 06:30.689
facing my husband without me.

06:30.690 --> 06:33.158
I am the only one who knows

06:33.159 --> 06:34.893
what he is capable of.

06:34.894 --> 06:39.097
Time is as much our enemy
as the Hidden One himself.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.633
So, I wish us all Godspeed.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.777
CRANE: Oh, Betsy, that's beautiful.

06:51.778 --> 06:53.845
These five-pointed stars...

06:55.915 --> 06:57.549
...they practically shimmer.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.084
(chuckles) An illusion,

06:59.085 --> 07:02.220
created with a little gold thread.

07:02.221 --> 07:04.923
I daresay if all goes well today,

07:04.924 --> 07:07.325
this may very well be
how I'm remembered.

07:11.197 --> 07:12.531
(horn honking)

07:12.532 --> 07:14.132
(tires squealing)

07:16.569 --> 07:18.203
- You okay?
- Apologies.

07:18.204 --> 07:19.338
I can drive.

07:19.339 --> 07:20.605
No, no, no, no, apologies.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.174
(exhales)

07:22.175 --> 07:23.709
My mind was elsewhere.

07:23.710 --> 07:26.344
Let me guess, December 1776.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.148
Crane, Washington cut
you out of a mission

07:30.149 --> 07:31.892
that could have changed
the tide of the war.

07:31.893 --> 07:35.053
You were his protégé,
his bravest officer,

07:35.054 --> 07:36.922
and instead of taking you, he took

07:36.923 --> 07:38.724
Betsy Ross and Paul Revere.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.125
That would haunt me, too.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.760
'Tis not simply the vote
of no confidence

07:41.761 --> 07:43.562
from my commanding officer, Lieutenant.

07:43.563 --> 07:46.765
When Betsy returned
from the Catacombs...

07:48.334 --> 07:50.168
...she was changed.

07:50.169 --> 07:52.938
The Catacombs changed me.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.741
Yes, of course, but...

07:55.742 --> 07:57.943
this was different.

07:57.944 --> 08:01.113
See, Betsy and I, we...

08:01.114 --> 08:02.714
we were very close.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.051
We were as close as
two compatriots can be.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.553
Until she came back from her mission.

08:08.554 --> 08:11.256
And we never spoke again.

08:13.559 --> 08:16.328
Just one letter...

08:16.329 --> 08:19.764
terminating our friendship.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.137
A tactical assault is off the table?

08:25.138 --> 08:26.571
He's a god.

08:26.572 --> 08:28.573
Trying to take him
down with brute force

08:28.574 --> 08:29.775
is suicide.

08:29.776 --> 08:31.543
We need to focus on the Hourglass.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.549
This is where you offer
that help we so badly need.

08:38.551 --> 08:40.519
In order to maximize

08:40.520 --> 08:41.852
the energies of the Hourglass,

08:41.854 --> 08:44.422
he will take it here.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.859
Bear Mountain?

08:47.860 --> 08:50.862
PANDORA: It sits upon a focal point

08:50.863 --> 08:52.697
of ancient energy.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.500
Energy he will use to amplify

08:55.501 --> 08:58.537
the forces held within the Hourglass

08:58.538 --> 09:01.940
to an even greater effect.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.942
His vantage point on the mountain

09:03.943 --> 09:07.312
will make his final
victory all the sweeter.

09:07.313 --> 09:11.550
When the sands run out,
the power within will flow

09:11.551 --> 09:14.186
with the greatest purity.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.980
That's good, Bear Mountain.
We have a target.

09:15.981 --> 09:17.364
According to Washington's journal,

09:17.365 --> 09:19.191
Bear Mountain

09:19.192 --> 09:22.194
is surrounded by a large amount
of intersecting ley lines.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.361
Say what?

09:23.362 --> 09:24.985
SOPHIE: Geomagnetic
markers in the earth,

09:24.986 --> 09:26.665
supposed to conduct mystical power.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.209
Okay, is there a way that can help us?

09:28.210 --> 09:30.068
PANDORA: The ancient
power of the ley lines

09:30.069 --> 09:31.303
can be channeled.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.471
Focused...

09:32.472 --> 09:33.738
for a specific purpose.

09:34.674 --> 09:37.342
I say we fight fire with fire.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.251
Lieutenant,

09:46.252 --> 09:48.553
would you do the honors?

09:49.689 --> 09:51.723
If this doesn't work,

09:51.724 --> 09:54.559
you do realize that we're
just two people on a boat,

09:54.560 --> 09:56.795
singing the anthem.

11:23.168 --> 11:24.635
you and I have technically died?

11:24.636 --> 11:28.506
You were buried
underground for centuries,

11:28.507 --> 11:30.674
choked out by a Sin Eater.

11:30.675 --> 11:31.909
Buried again by a tree.

11:31.910 --> 11:32.910
Trapped in purgatory,

your jaunt to 1781,

11:35.680 --> 11:39.517
abandoned in Ancient Catacombs...

11:39.518 --> 11:42.419
You have endured much, Lieutenant.

11:42.420 --> 11:44.622
I can endure anything.

11:44.623 --> 11:46.090
It's the losses

11:46.091 --> 11:47.892
that wear me down.

11:49.294 --> 11:50.995
My mom and Corbin.

My wife.

11:52.597 --> 11:54.732
My son.

11:54.733 --> 11:57.968
I prefer to focus on what we have,

11:57.969 --> 11:59.603
and I have a partner

11:59.604 --> 12:01.171
of the highest caliber.

12:02.107 --> 12:04.074
Better than Betsy Ross?

12:04.075 --> 12:06.577
Well, she was occasionally rather pushy.

12:06.578 --> 12:10.147
Prone to talking with
a mouth full of food.

12:10.148 --> 12:12.149
George Washington?

12:12.150 --> 12:15.119
Well, now there was a great man...

12:15.120 --> 12:17.154
but a great man

12:17.155 --> 12:18.823
with legendary halitosis.

12:18.824 --> 12:20.424
(laughs)

12:20.425 --> 12:21.759
I really beat those guys?

12:21.760 --> 12:22.827
Oh...

12:22.828 --> 12:24.862
handily.

12:26.731 --> 12:29.133
You...

12:29.134 --> 12:31.468
never waiver in your faith.

12:33.071 --> 12:34.872
In what we do. In me.

12:34.873 --> 12:37.007
And you know how rare that is,
don't you?

12:37.008 --> 12:41.512
When it concerns you and me,
Lieutenant,

12:41.513 --> 12:44.515
there is no greater certainty.

12:51.022 --> 12:52.323
Port bow.

12:57.629 --> 12:59.964
God's wounds...

12:59.965 --> 13:02.199
Washington's crew.

13:02.200 --> 13:06.437
Frozen in death's rigor
for over 200 years.

13:20.986 --> 13:22.619
Here.

13:24.556 --> 13:27.257
The web of ley lines we
seek begins at this spot.

13:28.193 --> 13:30.027
You heard the lady.

13:30.028 --> 13:31.895
All right, how many
of these do we need?

13:33.498 --> 13:37.568
They must surround the peak
in a precise formation.

13:37.569 --> 13:39.570
Only then will they trigger

13:39.571 --> 13:42.406
disturbance of a decent magnitude.

13:42.407 --> 13:44.742
So, we're planting spikes
across the whole mountain?

13:44.743 --> 13:47.745
Yes, with haste.

13:47.746 --> 13:49.146
Time grows short.

13:51.549 --> 13:53.884
Is she always like that?

13:53.885 --> 13:56.487
Trust me, man, this is her being nice.

13:59.858 --> 14:02.626
These men aren't
regular Colonial troops.

14:02.627 --> 14:04.461
CRANE: Washington hand-picked his team

14:04.462 --> 14:06.030
for the Delaware mission.

14:06.031 --> 14:08.666
These are members
of Knowlton's Rangers,

14:08.667 --> 14:11.936
the best militia
fighters of their time.

14:11.937 --> 14:13.704
Got musket ball strikes on the bodies,

14:13.705 --> 14:15.539
and behind the trees.

14:19.511 --> 14:23.514
Shrapnel from an explosive
charge on their boat.

14:28.119 --> 14:30.654
What the hell happened here, Crane?

14:39.564 --> 14:40.898
Crane?

14:40.899 --> 14:42.499
I recognize this handwriting.

14:47.105 --> 14:48.806
This was written by Betsy Ross.

14:48.807 --> 14:52.242
"Our last hope to win
the war has been lost.

14:52.243 --> 14:55.679
"Soon after we set off,
Captain Revere was ordered

14:55.680 --> 14:56.780
to return down river."

14:56.781 --> 14:58.615
With Washington on this mission,

14:58.616 --> 15:01.051
Revere would have been needed
to lead the attack on Trenton.

15:01.052 --> 15:03.687
"And as for General Washington
and our band of brothers,

15:03.688 --> 15:05.422
"our hopes of reaching the Catacombs

15:05.423 --> 15:07.057
have been violently dashed."

15:15.767 --> 15:18.268
"Despite best efforts

15:18.269 --> 15:22.239
"to safeguard the mission's security,

15:22.240 --> 15:24.241
"there appears to have been

15:24.242 --> 15:26.276
- an insurgent onboard."
- (gunshot)

15:26.277 --> 15:27.778
(screaming)

15:27.779 --> 15:29.747
Die, traitors!

15:29.748 --> 15:31.782
For King and Country,

15:31.783 --> 15:32.583
you bastards!

15:32.584 --> 15:34.184
Take him!

15:34.185 --> 15:35.486
ABBIE: "A saboteur."

15:35.487 --> 15:38.489
Gunpowder! Over the side!

15:38.490 --> 15:40.891
ABBIE: <i>"This slaughtered
the entire regiment."</i>

15:43.028 --> 15:45.696
Yet somehow Washington
and Betsy survived.

15:45.697 --> 15:48.165
They made it to the Catacombs,

15:48.166 --> 15:49.566
retrieved the Eye of Providence,

15:49.567 --> 15:52.036
and return to 1776

15:52.037 --> 15:54.071
just in time to take Trenton.

15:54.072 --> 15:56.175
Except you said she was
different when she came back.

15:56.176 --> 15:58.375
Said good-bye to you in a letter.

15:58.376 --> 16:01.545
'Twas as if she were a
different person altogether.

16:03.181 --> 16:04.815
My, God...

16:04.816 --> 16:06.650
what if that is

16:06.651 --> 16:09.353
exactly the case?

16:09.354 --> 16:12.089
You think the woman
that went on the mission,

16:12.090 --> 16:14.073
settled in Philadelphia,
and had all those kids...

16:14.074 --> 16:16.593
was not the real Elizabeth Phoebe Ross.

16:16.594 --> 16:18.796
We don't know that for sure, Crane.

16:18.797 --> 16:20.330
Washington made it back.

16:20.331 --> 16:21.914
I'm willing to bet that Betsy did, too.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.682
- Yep.
- Yes, yes.

16:24.536 --> 16:25.836
You and I both know,

16:25.837 --> 16:28.138
Lieutenant...

16:28.139 --> 16:31.074
victory often comes at a terrible loss.

16:46.091 --> 16:48.692
Reynolds, we're done in our sector.

16:48.693 --> 16:50.360
Got less than an hour by my clock.

16:50.361 --> 16:51.795
15 minutes max, and we'll be set.

16:52.897 --> 16:54.631
(birds screeching)

17:04.409 --> 17:06.843
He knows that we're here.

17:08.746 --> 17:10.380
Everyone, take cover now!

17:10.381 --> 17:11.982
(thunder rumbling)

17:11.983 --> 17:14.084
- Oh, my God.
- Go, go.

17:22.827 --> 17:25.162
♪

17:26.364 --> 17:27.798
(thunder rumbling)

17:41.021 --> 17:42.691
Nothing to tell us where or how

17:42.692 --> 17:43.892
to enter the Catacombs.

17:43.893 --> 17:45.441
No communiques, no maps,

17:45.442 --> 17:46.943
not even a compass among them.

17:46.944 --> 17:49.379
We've lost our way, just as they did.

17:49.380 --> 17:51.214
We came here to do a job, Crane,

17:51.215 --> 17:52.849
so keep searching.

17:52.850 --> 17:54.951
(sighs)

17:54.952 --> 17:57.887
Dead men really tell no tales.

17:59.723 --> 18:02.325
You.

18:05.429 --> 18:07.764
(grunts)

18:09.733 --> 18:10.800
(growling)

18:19.877 --> 18:21.310
Zombies again?

18:24.882 --> 18:26.516
(growling)

18:43.634 --> 18:45.468
(panting)

18:45.469 --> 18:46.970
What the hell is that?

18:46.971 --> 18:49.439
This is a dark magic charm,

18:49.440 --> 18:51.474
giving its wearer the curse

18:51.475 --> 18:53.509
- of eternal life.
- Oh.

18:53.510 --> 18:55.314
This is surely a tactic

18:55.315 --> 18:56.449
of General Howe's.

18:56.450 --> 18:57.851
He persuaded one of his spies

18:57.852 --> 18:59.961
to sacrifice his very humanity

18:59.962 --> 19:02.129
in order to sabotage Washington.

19:02.130 --> 19:05.566
Too bad good ol' George
didn't see it coming.

19:05.567 --> 19:08.102
(breathing heavily)

19:08.103 --> 19:09.937
Or perhaps he did.

19:16.778 --> 19:18.846
Clever.

19:18.847 --> 19:21.515
This letter's encoded.

19:21.516 --> 19:24.207
Now if Washington suspected sabotage,

19:24.208 --> 19:25.754
or that the British were sending

19:25.755 --> 19:27.923
reinforcements to follow him upriver,

19:27.924 --> 19:29.057
this will truly tell of it.

19:29.058 --> 19:30.692
Um...

19:30.693 --> 19:32.094
er,

19:32.095 --> 19:33.462
you don't happen to have...

19:33.463 --> 19:34.663
obliged.

19:35.698 --> 19:36.832
Let's see what

19:36.833 --> 19:38.166
you've got for us, Betsy.

19:40.603 --> 19:43.172
(grunting)

19:43.173 --> 19:44.406
Are you okay?

19:44.407 --> 19:46.108
Yeah, damn, that was intense.

19:46.109 --> 19:47.876
REYNOLDS: Mills!

19:49.345 --> 19:50.679
Everyone accounted for?

19:50.680 --> 19:52.147
JOE: Yeah, thanks for the heads up.

19:52.148 --> 19:53.849
So, the Hidden One took this round.

19:53.850 --> 19:54.983
I say we take the next.

19:54.984 --> 19:56.127
We got to finish this thing.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.587
We got a problem.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.823
PANDORA: My compass, it's broken.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.959
I cannot locate the
ley lines without it.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.943
Then we need to find another
way to pinpoint them.

20:05.944 --> 20:08.096
Jen, Crane's Christmas gift.

20:08.097 --> 20:10.466
Crane gave me one of George
Washington's original maps

20:10.467 --> 20:12.667
of the Hudson Valley.
It depicts all of of the ley lines

20:12.668 --> 20:14.661
around Sleepy Hollow,
but it's back at my trailer.

20:14.662 --> 20:16.581
The sands will have run
through the Hourglass

20:16.582 --> 20:17.973
by the time you return.

20:17.974 --> 20:20.576
I'll go. I can text you
all exact coordinates.

20:20.577 --> 20:21.910
It'll be just like
calling in an air strike.

20:21.911 --> 20:23.378
- Trust me, I got this.
- Okay, go.

20:23.379 --> 20:25.481
All right, watch your back, babe.

20:25.482 --> 20:28.884
That was a hell of a show
your husband put on back there.

20:28.885 --> 20:30.852
Thing is, I don't like
being blind-sided.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.156
Mills, you're on recon.

20:34.157 --> 20:36.060
I don't care if his real
name is the Hidden One,

20:36.061 --> 20:37.092
I want eyes on him.

20:37.093 --> 20:39.661
Wish me luck.

20:39.662 --> 20:41.245
All right, the rest of you are with me.

20:41.246 --> 20:43.347
All right. Copy that.

20:56.312 --> 20:58.380
Seems to be some kind of portal

20:58.381 --> 21:01.149
or gateway to the Catacombs themselves.

21:01.150 --> 21:03.986
I'm really going back there.

21:12.362 --> 21:14.363
Only this time you're not alone,

21:14.364 --> 21:17.532
and we have a way out.

21:25.074 --> 21:26.174
Shall we?

21:57.807 --> 22:00.676
♪

22:18.394 --> 22:20.128
I have eyes on him.

22:20.129 --> 22:23.498
Yeah, just make sure he
doesn't have eyes on you.

22:25.802 --> 22:26.835
Guys, I have a shot.

22:26.836 --> 22:28.136
Negative.

22:28.137 --> 22:28.971
Recon only.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.305
Come on, Reynolds.

22:30.306 --> 22:31.849
We may not get another chance at this.

22:31.850 --> 22:32.975
I said negative.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.142
Stick to the plan.

22:34.143 --> 22:36.878
Say again? You're breaking up.

22:51.527 --> 22:53.328
(phone beeps)

22:53.329 --> 22:54.463
Got them.

22:56.065 --> 22:57.766
Tell Joe good job.

22:57.767 --> 22:58.900
Get back here ASAP.

23:00.670 --> 23:01.937
(phone chimes)

23:11.180 --> 23:13.482
Hey.

23:13.483 --> 23:15.951
- Mr. Mills, what brings you here?
- Yeah, well,

23:15.952 --> 23:18.120
I was close by, thought I'd
stop in and say hello.

23:18.121 --> 23:20.055
Oh.

23:20.056 --> 23:21.156
Is it a bad time?

23:37.340 --> 23:38.874
(grunting)

23:47.016 --> 23:49.351
It almost impresses me.

23:49.352 --> 23:50.886
The insatiable

23:50.887 --> 23:53.522
mortal desire to fight what you

23:53.523 --> 23:55.857
cannot possibly conquer.

23:55.858 --> 23:57.859
I don't know what I
hate about you most:

23:57.860 --> 23:59.294
the way you talk,

23:59.295 --> 24:00.796
or the way you treat women.

24:00.797 --> 24:02.531
Let me help you choose.

24:02.532 --> 24:04.366
I know well

24:04.367 --> 24:07.502
the value mortals place on love.

24:09.338 --> 24:11.907
Let me take yours...

24:11.908 --> 24:14.643
and turn it into pain.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.850
EZRA: So, you two are busy, then?

24:21.851 --> 24:24.019
Uh, yeah, kind of, actually.

24:24.020 --> 24:25.754
The thing is Jen's stuck up at the top

24:25.755 --> 24:26.955
of Bear Mountain right now...

24:26.956 --> 24:28.223
so...

24:29.859 --> 24:30.926
(groans)

24:30.927 --> 24:31.960
You all right, son?

24:33.362 --> 24:35.797
No.

24:35.798 --> 24:38.166
No, no, no, no, no.

24:38.167 --> 24:38.900
Hey.

24:38.901 --> 24:40.969
(gasping)

24:40.970 --> 24:42.504
You need to run.

24:42.505 --> 24:43.905
(grunts)

24:44.807 --> 24:45.907
(in spectral voice): Run!

24:48.344 --> 24:50.912
(bellowing)

24:52.181 --> 24:53.815
HIDDEN ONE: The man you love...

24:53.816 --> 24:54.916
(grunts)

24:56.152 --> 24:59.020
is now, and shall be forever more...

24:59.021 --> 25:01.122
(bellowing)

25:02.859 --> 25:04.292
...a beast.

25:04.293 --> 25:06.828
(bellowing continues)

25:09.552 --> 25:12.623
It seems like you're having
a really bad day, son.

25:22.744 --> 25:24.745
SOPHIE: I can't get a
hold of either of them.

25:24.746 --> 25:27.472
Something's wrong, man,
he could have Joe or Jenny.

25:28.268 --> 25:30.374
If we're gonna move on this guy,
we got to do it now.

25:30.375 --> 25:32.007
Just roll up on his ass, guns blazing?

25:32.008 --> 25:34.676
This is about buying time,
not endangering more lives.

25:34.677 --> 25:37.179
We panic now,
we're playing into his hands.

25:37.180 --> 25:38.280
He's right.

25:38.281 --> 25:40.882
No one...

25:40.883 --> 25:44.486
no place is safe until my
husband has been dealt with.

25:45.455 --> 25:47.089
Finish your task.

25:47.090 --> 25:48.090
As soon as the last

25:48.091 --> 25:49.991
spike is planted,

25:49.992 --> 25:52.427
the energy in the ley lines
will be summoned,

25:52.428 --> 25:54.396
and the disturbance will then occur.

25:54.397 --> 25:56.231
And where are you going?

25:56.232 --> 25:58.166
We need more time.

25:59.602 --> 26:02.637
I will try and give us
as much as I can.

26:05.608 --> 26:08.043
No, no, you've helped enough.

26:09.712 --> 26:12.214
We can protect you from him.

26:12.215 --> 26:15.917
No one can be protected from a god,

26:15.918 --> 26:18.019
especially not an angry one.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.293
(screaming)

26:25.294 --> 26:28.063
(Wendigo bellowing)

26:35.104 --> 26:36.104
God Almighty.

26:36.105 --> 26:37.739
(gunshots)

26:37.740 --> 26:39.474
Joe? Joe, Joe!

26:39.475 --> 26:40.742
It's me, it's me.

26:40.743 --> 26:42.677
Okay, let's slow this down, okay?

26:42.678 --> 26:44.301
- Just like we did last time.
- Jennifer.

26:44.302 --> 26:45.614
Stay back, Dad. Joe.

26:45.615 --> 26:47.158
We're gonna have a quiet conversation,

26:47.159 --> 26:48.116
just you and me.

26:48.117 --> 26:49.784
(bellowing)

26:49.785 --> 26:51.411
EZRA: I don't know what
you're trying to do,

26:51.412 --> 26:52.281
but it's not working.

26:52.282 --> 26:52.988
We need to go!

26:52.989 --> 26:54.990
Damn it, Joe.

26:54.991 --> 26:57.292
- That's not gonna work!
- It's a tracking bullet.

26:57.293 --> 26:59.269
We need to keep tabs on
him until we have a plan.

26:59.270 --> 27:00.669
Go!

27:08.104 --> 27:10.572
(bellowing)

27:15.344 --> 27:18.280
I can't see a damn
thing on my right side.

27:27.290 --> 27:28.790
That's handy.

27:30.193 --> 27:32.406
Okay, coordinates put the location

27:32.407 --> 27:36.076
about 200 yards that way.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.987
Considering the baggage
Abbie brought to the party,

27:46.988 --> 27:48.956
I'd say you're handling
this pretty well.

27:49.958 --> 27:51.258
It tore her up inside

27:51.259 --> 27:52.893
keeping you in the dark, you know.

27:54.329 --> 27:55.629
Tore me up, too.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.798
Yeah, I bet.

27:57.799 --> 27:59.233
Truth is, you and Abbie

27:59.234 --> 28:01.502
weren't the only one to keep secrets.

28:01.503 --> 28:03.303
I was tasked

28:03.304 --> 28:04.638
to keep an eye on Abbie,

28:04.639 --> 28:07.307
reporting her movements, moods,

28:07.308 --> 28:09.109
any details.

28:09.110 --> 28:11.078
All covert, off the books.

28:11.079 --> 28:12.279
Reporting to whom?

28:12.280 --> 28:13.514
High level people.

28:13.515 --> 28:14.778
Assistant Director Jack Walters

28:14.779 --> 28:15.816
was my primary contact,

28:15.817 --> 28:17.518
but I have to assume
others are involved.

28:17.519 --> 28:19.753
So, they used you to spy on Abbie?

28:19.754 --> 28:21.021
I let them.

28:21.798 --> 28:23.757
Look, I don't even know
how much Walters knows,

28:23.758 --> 28:26.360
but he did refer to Abbie as an asset.

28:26.361 --> 28:28.829
And now you think the
fact that she's a Witness

28:28.830 --> 28:29.997
has something to do with it.

28:29.998 --> 28:31.732
I messed up.

28:31.733 --> 28:33.033
I can't change that,

28:33.034 --> 28:35.435
but I can do my best to protect her.

28:37.138 --> 28:39.239
The least I can do is
help save the world.

29:01.296 --> 29:03.830
It's very different in person.

29:03.831 --> 29:05.766
Sadder.

29:06.801 --> 29:08.735
Stranger, if that's possible.

29:17.545 --> 29:19.546
Your bishop, I presume.

29:19.547 --> 29:20.814
A rook,

29:20.815 --> 29:22.215
but you did always say that

29:22.216 --> 29:24.718
it looked like a bishop,
and it was just me

29:24.719 --> 29:26.687
trying to get an advantage over you.

29:26.688 --> 29:28.522
I still don't know

29:28.523 --> 29:30.626
how to deal with the fact
that those conversations...

29:30.627 --> 29:33.126
arguments, debates,
thousands of them...

29:33.127 --> 29:34.261
weren't real.

29:34.262 --> 29:35.429
It was just me

29:35.430 --> 29:37.698
talking to myself, trying to keep

29:37.699 --> 29:39.633
from falling off the edge.

29:39.634 --> 29:42.636
No, actually, in a way, they were real.

29:42.637 --> 29:44.605
I had many a rousing chat

29:44.606 --> 29:46.073
with you whilst we were apart.

29:47.775 --> 29:50.477
They meant we could
watch over one another.

29:50.478 --> 29:52.379
And now after all this time...

29:54.248 --> 29:55.916
...both of us wind up here,

29:55.917 --> 29:58.452
of all places.

29:58.453 --> 29:59.987
Using my prison...

29:59.988 --> 30:02.823
to save the world.

30:04.626 --> 30:07.794
I beat this, didn't I?

30:07.795 --> 30:10.197
Yes, you did.

30:13.301 --> 30:15.369
Ah, and this...

30:15.370 --> 30:16.536
must be your knight.

30:16.537 --> 30:18.338
Queen.

30:18.339 --> 30:19.373
Queen?

30:19.374 --> 30:21.041
Pure chicanery.

30:21.042 --> 30:23.477
Okay, Bobby Fischer,
let's go fix Pandora's box.

30:24.712 --> 30:26.113
I've been in this section before.

30:26.114 --> 30:28.882
I thought it was just...
ancient wallpaper.

30:28.883 --> 30:31.852
According to Pandora's instructions,

30:31.853 --> 30:33.687
'tis much more than that.

30:33.688 --> 30:35.989
Here.

30:38.826 --> 30:39.826
Bird.

30:39.827 --> 30:41.862
Huntress.

30:41.863 --> 30:43.663
Hourglass.

30:46.834 --> 30:48.502
Sun.

30:52.507 --> 30:55.142
This must lead to an inner chamber.

30:55.143 --> 30:59.212
(low rumbling)

31:25.106 --> 31:27.040
Crane.

31:45.226 --> 31:46.860
Betsy.

31:56.245 --> 31:59.138
CRANE: No breath, no pulse.

31:59.984 --> 32:01.318
I'm sorry, Crane.

32:01.319 --> 32:02.385
Yes, well,

32:02.386 --> 32:04.234
this must have been where

32:04.235 --> 32:07.204
the Eye of Providence was kept.

32:07.205 --> 32:08.939
Magical properties
would have kept her...

32:10.342 --> 32:12.242
...remains intact.

32:12.243 --> 32:14.912
I had the whole temple and
the Catacombs to wander.

32:14.913 --> 32:17.781
She was trapped in this
room for centuries.

32:17.782 --> 32:20.517
She deserved a better end than this.

32:27.225 --> 32:30.260
(sighs)

32:30.261 --> 32:31.995
At least now I know the truth.

32:33.431 --> 32:34.746
Look, Dad, I'm not sure what

32:34.747 --> 32:36.300
it is you wanted to show me,
but I have to explain

32:36.301 --> 32:37.301
what you just saw.

32:37.302 --> 32:39.103
Your boyfriend is a Wendigo.

32:43.241 --> 32:44.475
The supernatural?

32:44.476 --> 32:45.743
Monsters?

32:45.744 --> 32:47.311
I know all about them.

32:47.312 --> 32:48.846
For how long?

32:48.847 --> 32:50.814
Since before you and Abigail were born.

32:50.815 --> 32:52.518
- What?!
- I-I'm sorry I couldn't tell you,

32:52.519 --> 32:53.886
but I had my reasons.

32:56.821 --> 32:59.256
Half skull, obsidian blade.

32:59.257 --> 33:01.959
Just add some of his blood
and say the words.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.661
You know the Shawnee incantation?

33:03.662 --> 33:04.962
Yes, of course I do, but...

33:04.963 --> 33:06.130
Good girl.

33:06.131 --> 33:07.331
Okay, just in case...

33:07.332 --> 33:09.166
we'll bring this.

33:09.167 --> 33:12.670
It's a prototype ballistics weapon.

33:12.671 --> 33:14.338
It'll pretty much
take down any species,

33:14.339 --> 33:16.106
but it packs a punch,

33:16.107 --> 33:19.109
so last resort only, do you hear me?

33:20.478 --> 33:21.845
How much do you know?

33:21.846 --> 33:23.614
About me and Abbie?

33:23.615 --> 33:26.049
About... about Crane?

33:33.324 --> 33:35.559
You knew Corbin and Nevins.

33:35.560 --> 33:38.562
I was the one who took that picture.

33:38.563 --> 33:40.030
What... Dad...

33:40.031 --> 33:41.298
Jennifer,

33:41.299 --> 33:42.762
I know you have a million questions,

33:42.763 --> 33:44.401
and I promise I will answer every one,

33:44.402 --> 33:46.503
but right now we need to save Joe.

33:46.504 --> 33:48.739
I owe August Corbin that much.

33:53.244 --> 33:55.078
We should give her a ceremony.

33:56.448 --> 33:58.716
Just a few words.

33:58.717 --> 34:00.951
Let her soul be at peace.

34:00.952 --> 34:02.653
I don't think that's gonna work.

34:02.654 --> 34:05.475
Please, Lieutenant,
we must honor her sacrifice.

34:05.476 --> 34:07.913
No, Crane, I mean it's not gonna
work because she isn't dead.

34:07.914 --> 34:09.246
(gasping)

34:11.696 --> 34:15.364
(gasping)

34:15.366 --> 34:17.134
Betsy?

34:17.135 --> 34:18.668
Ichabod...

34:18.670 --> 34:20.637
is that you?

34:29.080 --> 34:31.114
You look well, my love.

34:31.116 --> 34:32.449
Do not...

34:32.449 --> 34:34.885
pretend that you love me.

34:36.254 --> 34:37.920
You never did.

34:37.922 --> 34:40.524
The truth was in front of
your eyes from the moment

34:40.525 --> 34:42.391
you first took pity on me.

34:45.563 --> 34:47.397
The other gods kept me imprisoned

34:47.398 --> 34:48.398
for very good reasons.

34:48.399 --> 34:50.567
Reasons that had nothing

34:50.568 --> 34:52.469
to do with benevolence,

34:52.469 --> 34:55.005
or mercy

34:55.005 --> 34:56.840
or love.

34:56.841 --> 34:59.643
All I've ever loved

34:59.644 --> 35:01.578
was power.

35:04.115 --> 35:07.417
When the last grain passes through,

35:07.418 --> 35:09.553
I will take your life.

35:11.022 --> 35:13.357
Slowly.

35:19.464 --> 35:21.131
Okay, that was the last one.

35:23.635 --> 35:26.537
Why isn't anything happening?

35:26.538 --> 35:28.238
I don't know.

35:28.239 --> 35:30.073
She said it would just start up.

35:39.951 --> 35:42.886
♪

35:47.125 --> 35:48.759
You would dare?!

35:55.114 --> 35:56.598
You found my letter...

35:56.807 --> 35:57.807
on the river.

35:57.808 --> 35:58.724
Quite... the mess.

35:58.725 --> 35:59.826
Washington and I

35:59.827 --> 36:01.260
were lucky to escape it.

36:01.261 --> 36:03.496
Ichabod, you are a sight for sore eyes.

36:03.497 --> 36:05.164
Although you look...

36:05.165 --> 36:07.300
different, your...

36:07.301 --> 36:08.768
- hair is...
- Yes, it's shorter.

36:08.769 --> 36:09.769
Cleaner.

36:09.770 --> 36:11.304
Right, Betsy,

36:11.305 --> 36:14.895
last I saw, you and General Washington

36:14.896 --> 36:16.062
were crossing to Trenton.

36:19.701 --> 36:21.736
Oh, my apologies.

36:21.737 --> 36:25.239
Allow me to introduce
Miss Abigail Mills.

36:25.240 --> 36:26.808
This is...

36:26.809 --> 36:29.210
Miss Elizabeth Ross.

36:34.249 --> 36:36.617
Tracker puts him half a mile out.

36:36.618 --> 36:39.353
He's headed this way.

36:39.354 --> 36:43.257
Why do you owe it to August Corbin?

36:44.859 --> 36:46.259
That was the deal.

36:47.628 --> 36:49.096
It killed me to leave but...

36:49.097 --> 36:51.465
it was for your own protection.

36:51.466 --> 36:52.933
What does that mean?

36:52.934 --> 36:54.068
(tracker beeps)

36:54.069 --> 36:55.836
- He's coming.
- Okay.

36:57.572 --> 37:01.007
(Wendigo bellowing)

37:04.612 --> 37:09.649
(whispering):
I'm sorry about this, babe.

37:09.650 --> 37:11.484
(screeches)

37:12.587 --> 37:14.921
(growling)

37:43.618 --> 37:45.318
EZRA: Hey! Hairy guy!

37:45.319 --> 37:47.287
Come here.

37:49.390 --> 37:50.523
Wait, Dad, don't!

37:54.796 --> 37:57.465
Joe, don't, no!

38:00.001 --> 38:01.534
(bellowing)

38:07.508 --> 38:08.908
Joe.

38:15.716 --> 38:17.317
Joe.

38:17.318 --> 38:18.351
Hey.

38:18.352 --> 38:19.452
(whispering): Joe.

38:20.922 --> 38:22.923
It's okay... it's okay.

38:22.924 --> 38:24.824
I didn't know.

38:24.825 --> 38:26.192
Hey.

38:26.193 --> 38:27.994
I love you.

38:27.995 --> 38:30.497
(crying): I love you.

38:30.498 --> 38:32.166
Joe.

38:32.167 --> 38:33.833
You had to, it's okay.

38:33.834 --> 38:35.502
You had to.

38:35.503 --> 38:36.503
(Joe groans)

38:36.504 --> 38:37.604
(sobbing)

38:39.507 --> 38:40.941
No.

38:40.942 --> 38:43.209
(crying): No, Joe, Joe.

38:45.379 --> 38:47.047
Joe, no!

38:47.048 --> 38:50.083
No. (sobbing continues)

38:50.084 --> 38:51.751
What did I do?

38:53.321 --> 38:55.588
What did I do?

39:02.396 --> 39:04.297
(low rumbling)

39:07.268 --> 39:08.601
(grunts)

39:09.537 --> 39:11.271
Enough!

39:32.927 --> 39:34.060
It is time.

39:40.101 --> 39:42.335
(low rumbling)

39:49.577 --> 39:52.078
(panting)

39:58.552 --> 40:00.086
Husband?

40:03.190 --> 40:04.825
(echoing): The man...

40:04.826 --> 40:08.062
you call husband no longer exists.

40:10.197 --> 40:12.800
All that remains...

40:12.801 --> 40:14.668
is his final wish.

40:18.472 --> 40:21.641
That this world shall burn!

40:25.146 --> 40:27.148
Betsy,

40:27.149 --> 40:29.516
how are you still alive?

40:29.517 --> 40:31.852
Bad luck, mainly.

40:31.853 --> 40:34.221
Honestly, after so many trials,

40:34.222 --> 40:36.824
you would think we were
due some decent fortune.

40:38.226 --> 40:39.495
We were close to our goal...

40:39.496 --> 40:42.545
retrieving the Eye of
Providence from this temple.

40:42.546 --> 40:43.698
General Washington

40:43.699 --> 40:45.966
had spent months
decoding ancient texts,

40:45.967 --> 40:48.003
preparing for this very moment.

40:53.208 --> 40:54.575
Our perseverance paid off...

40:58.381 --> 41:00.816
...until I became greedy, curious

41:00.817 --> 41:03.317
for more marvels held
within this chamber.

41:03.318 --> 41:06.320
(low rumbling)

41:06.321 --> 41:07.121
Betsy!

41:08.890 --> 41:10.391
General!

41:10.392 --> 41:12.103
Whatever sequence the general used

41:12.104 --> 41:13.648
to open this chamber no longer worked.

41:13.649 --> 41:14.261
It won't open!

41:14.262 --> 41:15.329
BETSY: <i>I was trapped.</i>

41:15.330 --> 41:16.606
I'll come back for you.

41:16.607 --> 41:18.271
BETSY: <i>I could faintly
hear his entreaties</i>

41:18.272 --> 41:19.211
through the wall...

41:19.212 --> 41:20.234
I'll find a way.

41:20.235 --> 41:21.702
...but I knew full well

41:21.703 --> 41:24.338
there was no time for any rescue.

41:24.339 --> 41:26.359
Priorities would force him
to finish the mission.

41:28.443 --> 41:31.056
I tried every single thing I could

41:31.057 --> 41:33.547
to escape...

41:33.548 --> 41:35.960
but I had not the knowledge
of ancient glyphs

41:35.961 --> 41:37.718
as you do, Ichabod.

41:39.087 --> 41:40.221
Days?

41:40.222 --> 41:41.288
Months?

41:41.289 --> 41:42.890
Somehow, the energies

41:42.891 --> 41:44.625
within the chamber
itself kept me alive.

41:44.626 --> 41:49.296
My hopes for a rescue
began to abandon me.

41:49.297 --> 41:51.098
Ultimately,

41:51.099 --> 41:55.169
I had no choice but to accept my fate.

41:55.170 --> 41:57.238
You can fill in the blanks
on the journey home.

41:57.239 --> 41:58.631
Tell me, both of you,

41:58.632 --> 42:00.274
how fares the War?

42:00.275 --> 42:01.778
Did we rout the blighters at Trenton?

42:01.779 --> 42:03.713
Betsy.

42:04.780 --> 42:07.348
You do know how long
you've been down here?

42:07.349 --> 42:08.716
Months.

42:08.717 --> 42:11.386
We must be well into
the New Year by now.

42:11.387 --> 42:12.753
Which New Year?

42:12.754 --> 42:15.890
1777.
