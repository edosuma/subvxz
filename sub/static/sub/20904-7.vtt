28:14.215 --> 28:16.251
<b>- I definitely lit a spark</b>
<b>up under his ass,</b>

28:16.351 --> 28:17.586
<b>but we got him through</b>
<b>that whole tattoo,</b>

28:17.686 --> 28:18.787
<b>and he has a great tattoo.</b>

28:18.887 --> 28:20.388
<b>- You go,</b>
<b>"This is a $200,000 tattoo,</b>

28:20.488 --> 28:22.057
<b>and if you can't do it,</b>
<b>get the [bleep] out!"</b>

28:22.157 --> 28:23.892
<b>- I said--</b>
<b>- Even if he is an asshole,</b>

28:23.992 --> 28:26.127
<b>he still leaves with</b>
<b>a tattoo that's perfect.</b>

28:26.227 --> 28:29.564
<b>You, being too nice,</b>
<b>made the bad tattoo.</b>

28:29.664 --> 28:30.832
<b>- I should've</b>
<b>been an asshole like DJ.</b>

28:30.932 --> 28:32.000
<b>- You should have!</b>
<b>- I wasn't an asshole.</b>

28:32.100 --> 28:33.268
<b>- If she was picky,</b>
<b>then you should've</b>

28:33.368 --> 28:35.904
<b>told her to shut</b>
<b>the [bleep] up and leave,</b>

28:36.004 --> 28:40.408
<b>or sit down so you didn't put</b>
<b>a [bleep] tattoo on her forever!</b>

28:40.508 --> 28:41.509
<b>It's on her forever!</b>

29:00.829 --> 29:02.664
<b>Christian,</b>
<b>this challenge was designed</b>

29:02.764 --> 29:04.666
<b>to test your weaknesses.</b>

<b>Basilica Tattoo,</b>
<b>you're up first.</b>

29:09.371 --> 29:10.238
<b>- There's a lot of strong</b>

29:10.338 --> 29:11.907
<b>technical aspects</b>
<b>to this tattoo.</b>

29:12.007 --> 29:14.276
<b>I like the texture and the flow</b>
<b>of the hair and the tail.</b>

29:14.376 --> 29:17.913
<b>But I think that as far</b>
<b>as the new school challenge,</b>

29:18.013 --> 29:19.781
<b>just 'cause it's bobblehead</b>
<b>and has a little bit of pink</b>

29:19.881 --> 29:21.716
<b>on the outline doesn't</b>
<b>really make it new school.</b>

29:21.816 --> 29:24.152
<b>- New school is probably</b>
<b>the one thing</b>

29:24.185 --> 29:26.187
<b>that we</b>
<b>were most afraid of.</b>

29:26.288 --> 29:28.323
<b>- The drawing itself</b>
<b>lacks a little dynamics.</b>

29:28.423 --> 29:30.692
<b>You guys are looking for a win.</b>
<b>You're not looking for a get by.</b>

29:30.792 --> 29:33.061

<b>I love how vibrant the space in</b>
<b>the background of this thing is.</b>

29:41.603 --> 29:43.738
<b>It's just enough to</b>
<b>let you know what's going on.</b>

29:43.838 --> 29:45.340
<b>That shows ingenuity.</b>

29:45.440 --> 29:46.841
<b>- Space is tricky, man.</b>

29:46.942 --> 29:48.376
<b>You did it right by leaving</b>
<b>a lot of this open skin</b>

29:48.476 --> 29:50.879
<b>on the astronaut, so you used</b>
<b>that contrast to your benefit.</b>

29:50.979 --> 29:52.213
<b>I love the way the tattoo ends.</b>

29:52.314 --> 29:54.015
<b>It doesn't end the same way</b>
<b>all around,</b>

29:54.182 --> 29:55.617
<b>but it just</b>
<b>has a very fluid flow.</b>

29:55.717 --> 29:56.885
<b>It's a killer tattoo,</b>

29:56.985 --> 29:59.187
<b>and I don't have</b>
<b>much to complain about.</b>

30:00.755 --> 30:04.192
<b>- Allegory Arts.</b>

30:04.292 --> 30:07.996
<b>- It's very new school style,</b>
<b>has a very cartoony look.</b>

30:08.129 --> 30:10.732
<b>The platypus has a nice,</b>
<b>clean outline everywhere.</b>

30:10.832 --> 30:13.368
<b>- That section of</b>
<b>this tattoo looks fantastic.</b>

30:13.468 --> 30:16.938
<b>And then everything else on this</b>
<b>tattoo just has me like, dammit.</b>

30:17.038 --> 30:18.807
<b>Lion head for me</b>
<b>has a ton of problems.</b>

30:18.907 --> 30:20.942
<b>Really, really,</b>
<b>really rough outlines.</b>

30:21.042 --> 30:23.011
<b>The black and pink area</b>
<b>of the nose,</b>

30:23.144 --> 30:24.946
<b>the outline on that is terrible.</b>

30:25.046 --> 30:26.781
<b>Got to really be mindful</b>
<b>of these things, guys,</b>

30:26.881 --> 30:28.883
<b>because a good tattoo is still</b>
<b>going home.</b>

30:29.818 --> 30:31.486
<b>- Damn.</b>

30:31.586 --> 30:34.556
<b>- Classic Trilogy Tattoo.</b>

30:34.656 --> 30:37.993
<b>- There are clean lines.</b>
<b>There's smooth color blends.</b>

30:38.159 --> 30:40.528
<b>But, man,</b>
<b>this drawing is very weird.</b>

30:40.629 --> 30:43.331
<b>The main thing that makes</b>
<b>a unicorn a unicorn is a horn.</b>

30:43.431 --> 30:44.933
<b>You would think</b>
<b>you would make that</b>

30:45.033 --> 30:46.768
<b>a very stand out,</b>
<b>noticeable feature.</b>

30:46.868 --> 30:48.904
<b>- Tried to.</b>
<b>She would not budge off of it.</b>

30:49.004 --> 30:52.173
<b>- The sidewalk and the</b>
<b>unicorn are the same color,</b>

30:52.274 --> 30:55.911
<b>and the smoky, like, purple</b>
<b>background is history in a year.</b>

30:56.011 --> 30:58.046
<b>- We literally tried to</b>
<b>explain everything to her,</b>

30:58.179 --> 30:59.948
<b>that we want a tattoo that's</b>
<b>gonna last a long time,</b>

31:00.115 --> 31:01.850
<b>and she fought us</b>
<b>the entire way.</b>

31:01.950 --> 31:04.486
<b>- Did she pack</b>
<b>your bags for you, too?</b>

31:04.586 --> 31:07.656
<b>I really expected this challenge</b>
<b>to be, like, you guys have this.</b>

31:07.756 --> 31:08.657
<b>- So did we.</b>

31:08.757 --> 31:11.526
<b>- It's a bummer.</b>

31:11.626 --> 31:15.030
<b>Black Spade Tattoo.</b>

31:15.130 --> 31:18.366
<b>- Love the drawing.</b>
<b>Love the color palette choices.</b>

31:18.466 --> 31:20.569
<b>I love everything but</b>
<b>the way you tattooed it.</b>

31:20.669 --> 31:24.339
<b>There is not a spot on</b>
<b>this thing that is solid.</b>

31:24.439 --> 31:27.809
<b>The background, burgundy's</b>
<b>not solid, orange isn't solid.</b>

31:27.909 --> 31:31.680
<b>You put all the right stuff and</b>
<b>set yourself up for another W.</b>

31:31.780 --> 31:35.817
<b>You didn't pull through.</b>

31:35.917 --> 31:39.020
<b>- Pinz and Needlez.</b>

31:39.154 --> 31:41.356
<b>- All this light,</b>
<b>light skin tone is</b>

31:41.456 --> 31:45.460
<b>really, really close to the</b>
<b>guy's already-there skin tone.</b>

31:45.560 --> 31:48.363
<b>As soon as this heals,</b>
<b>this thing is gonna be so flat.</b>

31:48.463 --> 31:51.866
<b>- The outline on the drum set,</b>
<b>that right side of that cymbal,</b>

31:51.967 --> 31:53.802
<b>what happened?</b>
<b>Did the guy sneeze?</b>

31:53.902 --> 31:55.003
<b>- Mid-line, he'd like,</b>
<b>switch his body,</b>

31:55.170 --> 31:56.638
<b>and like, rotate his head.</b>

31:56.738 --> 31:59.708
<b>- You guys are hot or cold.</b>
<b>You guys cannot just stay warm.</b>

32:01.977 --> 32:05.180
<b>- Artistic Skin Design.</b>

32:05.280 --> 32:06.514
<b>- I don't think</b>
<b>it's the best drawing.</b>

32:06.615 --> 32:08.383
<b>If we look at the hand</b>
<b>that's playing guitar,</b>

32:08.483 --> 32:12.487
<b>no way, no how do any of</b>
<b>those fingers make any sense.</b>

32:12.587 --> 32:15.890
<b>And the thumb coming</b>
<b>from behind the guitar is crazy.</b>

32:15.991 --> 32:17.125
<b>- Not a fan of this tattoo.</b>

32:17.225 --> 32:19.761
<b>This blue forcefield is rough.</b>

32:19.861 --> 32:22.998
<b>It's just a sea</b>
<b>of washed-out color.</b>

32:23.131 --> 32:24.466
<b>This tattoo looks 20 years old.</b>

32:24.566 --> 32:26.501
<b>You guys have done</b>
<b>bright, strong tattoos</b>

32:26.601 --> 32:29.170
<b>that look like stickers.</b>
<b>This one does not.</b>

32:32.507 --> 32:35.277
<b>- Boneface Ink.</b>

32:35.377 --> 32:37.145
<b>- The drawing</b>
<b>is super challenged.</b>

32:37.212 --> 32:39.581
<b>These are just two heads</b>
<b>growing out of this little body.</b>

32:39.681 --> 32:42.717
<b>- This little green guy on</b>
<b>the left is totally jacked, man.</b>

32:42.817 --> 32:45.854
<b>One eye is round and outside</b>
<b>of the bottom of the eyelid,</b>

32:45.954 --> 32:48.990
<b>and the other eye is squared off</b>
<b>and tucked inside of the eyelid.</b>

32:49.157 --> 32:51.259
<b>The finished product</b>
<b>has a very amateur feel to it.</b>

32:51.359 --> 32:53.028
<b>It doesn't have the look of</b>

32:53.161 --> 32:56.298
<b>what we know Boneface's</b>
<b>finished tattoos look like.</b>

32:57.966 --> 33:01.503
<b>- Unkindness Art.</b>

33:01.603 --> 33:04.372
<b>- There's a lot of really great,</b>
<b>shining effects in this tattoo.</b>

33:04.472 --> 33:06.541
<b>The outline</b>
<b>throughout is super clean.</b>

33:06.641 --> 33:09.311
<b>You have multiple dynamic</b>
<b>light sources coming from</b>

33:09.411 --> 33:12.213
<b>each direction, and it hits</b>
<b>the image all in the right spot.</b>

33:12.314 --> 33:14.883
<b>The green glow from the bottom</b>
<b>and the blue glow from the top</b>

33:14.983 --> 33:16.484
<b>is intense</b>
<b>and it looks really cool.</b>

33:16.585 --> 33:19.888
<b>It definitely shows a</b>
<b>lot of ingenuity in drawing it.</b>

33:19.988 --> 33:22.324
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

33:23.692 --> 33:25.760
<b>- Okay, guys, time to</b>
<b>announce tattoo of the day.</b>

33:25.860 --> 33:29.364
<b>- For me, there's two that stand</b>
<b>out, Old Town and Unkindness.</b>

33:29.464 --> 33:33.134
<b>The best thing of the day</b>
<b>is in Unkindness with the eyes,</b>

33:33.201 --> 33:36.137
<b>the purple wrinkle, but</b>
<b>I don't like the green swirl.</b>

33:36.171 --> 33:38.974
<b>- In the Old Town Tattoo,</b>
<b>the way this background</b>

33:39.140 --> 33:40.442
<b>was done,</b>
<b>that looks really good.</b>

33:40.542 --> 33:41.710
<b>- I like the really dark</b>
<b>background</b>

33:41.810 --> 33:42.944
<b>against the light suit.</b>

33:43.044 --> 33:45.013
<b>- Yeah, that black</b>
<b>gives this thing</b>

33:45.146 --> 33:46.481
<b>that believable dimension.</b>

33:46.581 --> 33:49.184
<b>- I'll make it easy.</b>
<b>My vote is for Old Town.</b>

33:49.284 --> 33:50.785
<b>- Old Town.</b>
<b>- Chris?</b>

33:50.885 --> 33:52.354
<b>- Old Town it is.</b>

33:52.454 --> 33:53.688
<b>- The judges have decided that</b>

33:53.788 --> 33:57.158
<b>the best tattoo of the</b>
<b>day goes to Old Town Ink.</b>

33:58.994 --> 34:00.595
<b>All right, guys,</b>
<b>as the jury of peers,</b>

34:00.695 --> 34:04.266
<b>you must now deliberate and</b>
<b>put one shop up for elimination.</b>

34:04.366 --> 34:06.434
<b>Head on back to the loft.</b>

34:07.269 --> 34:08.436
<b>- We know who's on the top.</b>

34:08.536 --> 34:09.771
<b>Who do you think's</b>
<b>on the bottom?</b>

34:09.871 --> 34:11.106
<b>- We had perfect application,</b>
<b>they said, so--</b>

34:11.172 --> 34:12.407
<b>- Perfect application?</b>

34:12.507 --> 34:14.141
<b>- It was a flat,</b>
<b>boring-ass tattoo--</b>

34:14.242 --> 34:16.011
<b>- But--</b>
<b>- And all you did</b>

34:16.110 --> 34:17.879
<b>was blame everything</b>
<b>on the canvas.</b>

34:17.978 --> 34:19.147
<b>That was hard to hear, man.</b>

34:19.246 --> 34:21.483
<b>- Oh, I'm sorry,</b>
<b>I guess I'll just treat</b>

34:21.583 --> 34:24.351
<b>my client like [bleep]</b>
<b>and I'll win tattoo of the day.</b>

34:24.452 --> 34:25.719
<b>- Well, maybe you'll do</b>
<b>a good tattoo, then,</b>

34:25.820 --> 34:26.922
<b>I don't know.</b>
<b>- Oh, yeah?</b>

34:27.022 --> 34:28.690
<b>- Or maybe you can go</b>
<b>back to Snitchita</b>

34:28.790 --> 34:31.126
<b>and go tell on everybody else</b>
<b>like you did with these guys.</b>

34:31.226 --> 34:32.893
<b>- Oh, I'm sorry!</b>

34:32.994 --> 34:34.228
<b>I'm just gonna break the rules</b>
<b>and I'm gonna win from now on!</b>

34:34.329 --> 34:35.597
<b>- Dude, you're just</b>
<b>gonna do whatever you can</b>

34:35.697 --> 34:37.232
<b>to divert attention</b>
<b>from anything you've done.</b>

34:37.331 --> 34:38.833
<b>- We [bleep] said</b>
<b>that [bleep] was dull.</b>

34:38.934 --> 34:39.900
<b>We said it was dull.</b>
<b>- Bull[bleep].</b>

34:40.001 --> 34:41.136
<b>You lawyered everything.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

34:41.202 --> 34:42.637
<b>- You threw everybody</b>
<b>under the bus.</b>

34:42.737 --> 34:43.972
<b>Since I've been here,</b>
<b>you've done nothing--</b>

34:44.139 --> 34:45.540
<b>- And you've only</b>
<b>been here one challenge.</b>

34:45.639 --> 34:46.975
<b>- Yeah, and that's all it took</b>
<b>for me to not like how you work.</b>

34:47.141 --> 34:49.444
<b>- Oh, I'm sorry.</b>

34:51.337 --> 34:54.974
<b> <i>[exciting music]</i> </b>

34:55.074 --> 34:56.476

<b>to determine</b>
<b>who had the worst tattoo.</b>

34:57.911 --> 34:59.412
<b>Who do you guys</b>
<b>think's going to the bottom?</b>

34:59.512 --> 35:00.847
<b>- Ours.</b>
<b>- Yeah, ours.</b>

35:00.947 --> 35:03.149
<b>- I felt like the composition</b>
<b>from the beginning,</b>

35:03.249 --> 35:05.151
<b>we didn't take the</b>
<b>time we needed to take</b>

35:05.251 --> 35:07.487
<b>to make sure we had</b>
<b>a solid foundation.</b>

35:07.587 --> 35:08.788

35:08.888 --> 35:10.356
<b>- That middle cat's</b>
<b>pretty solid to me.</b>

35:10.457 --> 35:11.791
<b>- Yeah, it is pretty solid.</b>

35:11.891 --> 35:13.226
<b>The color saturation</b>
<b>is actually pretty smooth,</b>

35:13.326 --> 35:14.894
<b>and I think some other people</b>
<b>got ripped up</b>

35:14.994 --> 35:16.629
<b>for technical applications</b>
<b>as well.</b>

35:16.730 --> 35:17.964
<b>- Black Spade,</b>
<b>I feel like you guys had</b>

35:18.064 --> 35:19.833
<b>a really awesome drawing,</b>
<b>but the technical--</b>

35:19.933 --> 35:21.801
<b>like, there's just</b>
<b>errors throughout it.</b>

35:21.901 --> 35:24.003
<b>- Well, I don't think we</b>
<b>deserve to be on the bottom.</b>

35:24.104 --> 35:25.238
<b>- The technical application in</b>

35:25.338 --> 35:27.941
<b>this one falls way</b>
<b>short of good design.</b>

35:28.041 --> 35:31.044
<b>- But they didn't beat</b>
<b>us up as much as Artistic.</b>

35:31.144 --> 35:33.780
<b>They beat you guys</b>
<b>up for the bland color.</b>

35:33.880 --> 35:35.515
<b>- Those fingers</b>
<b>are really bad, though.</b>

35:35.615 --> 35:37.083
<b>- They're zombie fingers.</b>

<b>- I think the only thing</b>
<b>really wrong</b>

35:38.885 --> 35:39.986
<b>with the fingers</b>
<b>is the thumb.</b>

35:40.086 --> 35:41.454
<b>- It's coming</b>
<b>from the wrong side.</b>

35:41.554 --> 35:43.189
<b>- Yeah, if the thumb came</b>
<b>from the top and not the bottom.</b>

35:43.289 --> 35:45.859
<b>- I don't think it's 100% as cut</b>
<b>and dried as we're making it.</b>

35:45.959 --> 35:47.227
<b>- I think we learned</b>
<b>that there's</b>

<b>no guarantee you're going out.</b>
<b>You never know.</b>

35:48.762 --> 35:50.263
