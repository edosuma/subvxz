NASTY TRAIL MIX WITH SOMEONE.

05:19.350 --> 05:20.821
SHOW HER AROUND.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.339
SO THIS IS IT?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.372

05:41.372 --> 05:42.873
UNLESS, UH...

05:42.873 --> 05:44.675
DO YOU NEED A MINUTE
TO SAY SOMETHING--

05:44.675 --> 05:46.346
I'VE SAID IT.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.519
HE'S BEEN LISTENING TO ME TALK
FOR 22 YEARS.

05:48.519 --> 05:52.052
I'M SURE HE'S GRATEFUL
FOR A LITTLE PEACE AND QUIET.

05:52.052 --> 05:55.055
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

05:55.055 --> 05:56.457
WHAT NOW?

05:56.457 --> 05:58.459
WE'LL TURN OFF
THE VENTILATOR.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.491
HIS RESPIRATIONS WILL STOP.

06:00.491 --> 06:03.394
I'LL DISCONNECT HIS MONITORS
AND HIS FEEDING TUBE...

06:03.394 --> 06:04.364
(laughs)
AND THEN--

06:04.364 --> 06:05.736
HE SAID THIS ONCE...

06:05.736 --> 06:07.538
WE WERE WATCHING
SOME DUMB MOVIE ON TV,

06:07.538 --> 06:10.441

ON ANOTHER GUY...

06:10.441 --> 06:11.872
(laughs) AND HE--
(machine powering down)

06:11.872 --> 06:14.405
HE SAID, "DON'T YOU DARE
DO THAT TO ME."

06:14.405 --> 06:15.806
HE WAS JOKING.
"DON'T YOU DO THAT TO ME.

06:15.806 --> 06:17.478
"YOU LEAVE THAT PLUG
IN THE WALL,

06:17.478 --> 06:19.580
YOU PUT MY ORGANS IN A JAR."

06:19.580 --> 06:23.584
(laughs)
"DON'T YOU GIVE UP ON ME."

06:23.584 --> 06:24.755
(laughs)

06:24.755 --> 06:26.987
STOP. STOP THIS.
STOP IT. STOP IT.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.491
STOP. I C--I C--
I CAN'T DO THIS.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.562
(clipboard clatters)
I CAN'T DO THIS.

06:31.562 --> 06:32.763
TURN--TURN THIS BACK ON.

06:32.763 --> 06:33.924
TURN IT BACK ON.

06:33.924 --> 06:35.566
(switch clicks, monitor beeps)

06:39.099 --> 06:41.472
(Cristina) THE HUSBAND
WITHDREW CONSENT, OWEN.

06:41.472 --> 06:43.504
I HAD ALREADY TURNED OFF
THE VENT WHEN HE SAID NO.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.676
HE HAS MEDICAL P.O.A.
HE SAID STOP. I STOPPED.

06:45.676 --> 06:47.137
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

06:47.137 --> 06:48.509
I'M GOING TO GET IN ON, UH,
TEDDY'S PREEMIE SURGERY.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.980
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

06:49.980 --> 06:51.141
YOU'RE GONNA STAY WITH HIM UNTIL
HE GIVES HIS CONSENT AGAIN.

06:51.141 --> 06:52.513
YOU WANT ME TO TRY
AND TALK HIM INTO IT?

06:52.513 --> 06:53.484
NO, I WANT YOU
TO HELP HIM THROUGH IT.

06:53.484 --> 06:54.785
I WANT YOU
TO HELP HIM UNDERSTAND

06:54.785 --> 06:56.487
THAT THIS IS THE ONLY OPTION
LEFT FOR HIS HUSBAND.

06:56.487 --> 06:58.118
I WANT YOU TO DO YOUR JOB

06:58.118 --> 06:59.850
AND FIND SOME DAMN COMPASSION.

06:59.850 --> 07:01.151
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?

07:01.151 --> 07:04.094
I JUST WONDER
IF I COULD HELP.

07:04.094 --> 07:05.556
NO.

07:05.556 --> 07:06.927
(indistinct conversations)

07:06.927 --> 07:09.099
I'VE--I'VE BEEN WITH THESE GUYS
SINCE MICHAEL FIRST CAME IN.

07:09.099 --> 07:10.931
AND WE'VE TALKED.
THEY KNOW ME.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.102
AREN'T YOU ON NIGHTS NOW?

07:12.102 --> 07:13.433
WELL, I CAN HANG AROUND
IF IT'LL HELP.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.606
WELL, I DON'T--I--
CRISTINA,

07:15.606 --> 07:17.538
SHE CAN HELP,
LET HER HELP.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.639
THANK YOU.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.944
THANKS.

07:23.944 --> 07:34.224
(siren wailing)

07:38.789 --> 07:39.960
SO I'M A WEEK
OUT OF LAW SCHOOL...

07:39.960 --> 07:41.161
UH-HUH.
FIRST BIG INTERVIEW,

07:41.161 --> 07:42.132
HUGE FIRM.

07:42.132 --> 07:43.494
I'VE NEVER HAD
A BETTER INTERVIEW.

07:43.494 --> 07:44.935
SO I STAND UP
TO SHAKE HANDS,

07:44.935 --> 07:46.597
AND I PASS OUT--
RIGHT OVER THE COFFEE TABLE.

07:46.597 --> 07:47.798
DRAPED OVER
THE COFFEE TABLE

07:47.798 --> 07:49.139
WITH MY BUTT IN THE AIR.
AND YOUR SKIRT...

07:49.139 --> 07:50.470
MY SKIRT RIDES UP
TO MY WAIST.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.242
NOT EVEN GOOD PANTIES.
GRANNY PANTIES.

07:52.242 --> 07:53.504
OOH. WOW.
MM-HMM.

07:53.504 --> 07:54.474
DID YOU GET THE JOB?
NO.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.076
WELL, YOUR NEXT INTERVIEW
WILL END MUCH BETTER

07:56.076 --> 07:57.678
ONCE WE REMOVE THE CYST.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.250
WE'RE GONNA PERFORM WHAT WE CALL
A MARSUPIALIZATION OF THE CYST.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.582
WE OPEN UP
THE WALL OF THE CYST

08:01.582 --> 08:02.913
SO THAT IT CAN DRAIN FREELY

08:02.913 --> 08:04.214
AND THEN THE FLUID
WON'T COLLECT.

08:04.214 --> 08:05.556
SO YOUR DIZZY SPELLS
WILL STOP.

08:05.556 --> 08:06.987
BUT YOU SAID YOU FOUND
A TUMOR.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.488
MM-HMM. WE DID.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.720
IT'S A SMALL ONE.
IT'S CALLED A MENINGIOMA.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.722
IT'S BENIGN, SO WE'RE GONNA
LEAVE IT ALONE.

08:11.722 --> 08:12.893
IF IT EVER DOES CAUSE
A PROBLEM,

08:12.893 --> 08:14.064
IT'S EASY ENOUGH
TO REMOVE.

08:14.064 --> 08:15.225
DR. GREY COULD DO IT.

08:15.225 --> 08:16.196
OH, GO, GIRL.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.868
BUT THE CYST
IS IN THE TEMPORAL LOBE.

08:17.868 --> 08:19.930
THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING
THE SEIZURES AND THE DIZZINESS.

08:19.930 --> 08:21.532
WE'RE GONNA GO AFTER THAT.

08:21.532 --> 08:22.703
SO THIS IS IT?

08:22.703 --> 08:24.174
THIS IS IT.

08:24.174 --> 08:25.606
WE WILL SEE YOU
WHEN IT IS ALL OVER.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.777
THANK YOU.

08:26.777 --> 08:28.539
AH, DR. GREY.
SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US.

08:28.539 --> 08:30.210
I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.181
SHE MISSES ME.

08:31.181 --> 08:32.543
SHE'S NOT EVEN
ON NEURO ANYMORE.

08:32.543 --> 08:33.714
WELL, SHE'S THINKING
ABOUT COMING BACK.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.885
(laughs) I'M NOT.

08:34.885 --> 08:36.116
SHE IS.
SHE'S REMEMBERING THE MAGIC.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.287
(elevator bell dings)

08:37.287 --> 08:38.819
CAN HE EVEN TAKE
HEART SURGERY?

08:38.819 --> 08:41.291
HE HAS TO. HE HAS
A PERICARDIAL TUMOR

08:41.291 --> 08:43.093
COMPRESSING ON HIS HEART.
HE'S DECOMPENSATING.

08:43.093 --> 08:44.555
HE HAS A BRAIN BLEED.

08:44.555 --> 08:46.697
SHOULDN'T HEART SURGERY WAIT
TILL AFTER IT'S CLEARED UP?

08:46.697 --> 08:48.699
I WISH WE COULD,
BUT IT HAS TO HAPPEN TODAY.

08:48.699 --> 08:50.260
HEY.

08:50.260 --> 08:54.304
SO TOMMY'S HIP DYSPLASIA
CAN BE TREATED WITH A HARNESS.

08:54.304 --> 08:56.206
AND I BROUGHT YOU A SCONE
SINCE YOU SKIPPED BREAKFAST.

08:56.206 --> 08:58.008
OH, THANK YOU.
MM-HMM.

08:58.008 --> 08:59.970
PUMPKIN. EW.

08:59.970 --> 09:02.272
(Alex) I'LL TAKE IT.

09:02.272 --> 09:03.243
EAT THAT.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.615
RIGHT. LIKE I CAN EAT.

09:04.615 --> 09:06.046
(rustles paper bag)

09:06.046 --> 09:08.579
YOU DIDN'T EAT ALL NIGHT.
YOU'RE GONNA PASS OUT.

09:08.579 --> 09:09.880
JUST EAT IT.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.582
WHEN, UH, WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO DO THE SURGERY?

09:11.582 --> 09:12.552
(Teddy)
AS SOON AS HE'S PREPPED.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.124
KAREV WILL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN WE GET STARTED.

09:14.124 --> 09:15.255
(Alex) YEAH,
I'M GONNA SCRUB IN, RIGHT?

09:15.255 --> 09:16.957
YOU JUST WANT
HIM TO HAVE SURGERY

09:16.957 --> 09:18.558
'CAUSE IT'LL LOOK GOOD
FOR YOUR BOARDS.
I DO NOT.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.330
AND ALSO I DO,

09:20.330 --> 09:22.232
BUT IT'S GONNA BE GREAT
FOR MY BOARDS.

09:22.232 --> 09:23.894
LOOK, HE'S GONNA BE FINE,
ALL RIGHT?

09:23.894 --> 09:25.736
HE'S NOT SCRUBBING IN.
HE WAS UP ALL NIGHT.

09:25.736 --> 09:27.567
OH, SHUT UP.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.269
SHOULD KAREV
REALLY BE HOOKING UP

09:29.269 --> 09:30.741
WITH THE HEART-PATIENT
INTERN MOM? I MEAN--

09:30.741 --> 09:32.743
WHAT? NO, HE'S NOT.

09:32.743 --> 09:35.345
HE SPENT THE NIGHT.
HE GAVE HER A SCONE.

09:35.345 --> 09:37.608
YOU GAVE ME A SCONE.
YEAH, I SPEND THE NIGHT
WITH YOU, TOO,

09:37.608 --> 09:39.009
BECAUSE I'M MARRIED TO YOU.

09:40.350 --> 09:42.352
NO. NO.
SHE'S HIS INTERN.

09:42.352 --> 09:44.014
I MEAN, HE'S JUST--HE'S--
HE'S TRYING TO--

09:44.014 --> 09:45.355
TO BE NICE, TO CARE.
OH.

09:45.355 --> 09:46.857
I MEAN, ALEX KAREV
IS TRYING TO BE MORE HUMAN,

09:46.857 --> 09:50.290
AND I THINK THAT
WE CAN THANK ME FOR THAT.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.662
THEY'RE DOING IT.

09:51.662 --> 09:52.893
(elevator bell dings)

09:52.893 --> 09:55.065
THEY BUILT YOU
A BEAUTIFUL BLADDER.

09:55.065 --> 09:56.296
CAN I SEE IT?

09:56.296 --> 09:57.267
OH, HONEY, NO. YOU DON'T
WANT TO SEE THAT THING.

09:57.267 --> 09:58.629
IT'S NASTY. (laughs)

09:58.629 --> 09:59.770
(laughs)

09:59.770 --> 10:01.672
NO, NO, PICTURE A BREAD BOWL

10:01.672 --> 10:03.003
LIKE YOUR SOUP COMES IN...
UH-HUH.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.334
ONLY THIS ONE
IS MADE OUT OF MEAT.
MM.

10:04.334 --> 10:06.336
OH... (laughing)
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

10:06.336 --> 10:08.278
I'M GONNA PEE.

10:08.278 --> 10:09.309
(continues laughing)

10:09.309 --> 10:11.281
OH. OH, GOD. THERE I GO.

10:11.281 --> 10:13.283
(gasps) OH, SWEETHEART.
I'M SO SORRY. OOH.

10:13.283 --> 10:15.615
NO, I'M SORRY.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.117
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THAT SHOULD END TODAY.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.749
YOU WON'T HAVE TO BE SCARED
THAT YOUR BLADDER WILL LET GO

10:18.749 --> 10:20.891
EVERY TIME YOU LAUGH.
OR SNEEZE

10:20.891 --> 10:22.793
OR COUGH OR HAVE SEX.

10:22.793 --> 10:24.354
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A VERY FULL LIFE

10:24.354 --> 10:25.926
WHEN DR. AVERY'S
DONE WITH YOU.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.258
I LIKE TO THINK THAT EVERYBODY
LIVES A VERY FULL LIFE

10:28.258 --> 10:30.230
ONCE I'M DONE WITH THEM.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.302
(elevator bell dings)

10:34.665 --> 10:36.667
AND THERE...

10:36.667 --> 10:37.738
WE...
(cracks)

10:37.738 --> 10:38.909
ARE.

10:38.909 --> 10:40.170
GREAT.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.912
THAT'S A PERFECT CRANIOTOMY.
RIGHT, DR. GREY?

10:41.912 --> 10:43.774
YOU DRAGGED ME
BACK INTO NEURO

10:43.774 --> 10:45.645
TO WATCH LEXIE
DO A BORING PROCEDURE?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.277
HEY, IT IS NOT BORING.
IT IS NOT BORING.

10:47.277 --> 10:48.749
IT'S HER FIRST SOLO CYST.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.420
BE A BIG SISTER.
CHEER HER ON.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.782
SHEPHERD,
I'VE GOT A MOTORCYCLE COP

10:51.782 --> 10:53.954
OPEN ON THE TABLE
WITH A C-7 FRACTURE.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.225
I NEED YOUR EYES ON THE CORD.
CAN YOU--

10:55.225 --> 10:56.957
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
OKAY.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.358
WHEN YOU, UM,
MARSUPIALIZE THAT,

10:58.358 --> 11:00.691
MAKE SURE THAT YOU--
TACK THE EDGES. YES, I KNOW.

11:00.691 --> 11:01.962
OKAY.
RIGHT.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.363
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.295
JUST OBSERVE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

11:05.295 --> 11:06.666
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING--

11:06.666 --> 11:08.168
WE WON'T. GO.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.339
(people speaking indistinctly
over intercom)

11:09.339 --> 11:10.701
AND THIS IS O.R. TWO,

11:10.701 --> 11:13.043
WHICH LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE
O.R. ONE.

11:13.043 --> 11:15.706
YOU STILL HAVE TO COVER THE E.R.
IN THE FIFTH YEAR,

11:15.706 --> 11:16.877
AND STUDY FOR YOUR BOARDS?

11:16.877 --> 11:18.378
YEAH, IT'S A PRETTY
RIGOROUS PROGRAM.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.810
SPEAKING OF WHICH, I NEED TO BE
GETTING BACK TO WORK, SO--

11:19.810 --> 11:23.313
DO YOU MIND
IF WE WATCH FOR A SECOND?

11:23.313 --> 11:25.856
OF COURSE.

11:25.856 --> 11:27.858
GOD. I THOUGHT I HAD
NO TIME FOR A SOCIAL LIFE.

11:27.858 --> 11:29.019
(chuckles)

11:29.019 --> 11:31.691
ARE YOU STILL DATING ANYONE?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.724
AM I STILL DATING?

11:33.724 --> 11:36.196
I MEAN,
ARE YOU DATING ANYONE?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.698
TELL ME ABOUT YOU.
WHERE'D YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

11:38.698 --> 11:41.872
WELL, MY DAD'S THE DIRECTOR
OF SURGICAL SCIENCE AT OXFORD,

11:41.872 --> 11:43.703
SO I DID
MY PRECLINICAL YEARS THERE.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.405
OXFORD. WOW.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.706
THEN RESIDENCY AT MASS GEN,

11:46.706 --> 11:47.878
THEN I TRANSFERRED
TO THE BRIGHAM

11:47.878 --> 11:49.209
TO STUDY UNDER YOUR MOTHER,

11:49.209 --> 11:50.710
AND HERE I AM.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.282
THAT'S QUITE A PEDIGREE,
ISN'T IT?

11:52.282 --> 11:53.483
WELL, YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE HARD WORK

11:53.483 --> 11:55.485
AND A LOT OF GOOD TIMING.

11:55.485 --> 11:57.447
NO, I GET IT.

11:57.447 --> 12:00.290
I TOTALLY GET IT.

12:00.290 --> 12:01.792
IS THAT DEREK SHEPHERD?

12:01.792 --> 12:03.353
SO THERE'S CORD DAMAGE.

12:03.353 --> 12:06.126
DO YOU MIND IF WE STAY
AND WATCH THIS FOR...

12:06.126 --> 12:09.199
JUST A FEW MORE SUTURES.

12:09.199 --> 12:11.962
(Arizona) GOD, I HAVE SEEN
SOME TINY LITTLE HEARTS, BUT--

12:11.962 --> 12:14.734
(Teddy)
THIS IS THE TINIEST.

12:14.734 --> 12:15.866
(monitor beeping erratically)
WHOA.

12:15.866 --> 12:17.467
HIS PRESSURE'S DROPPED.
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:17.467 --> 12:19.870
DOCTOR, HIS FONTANEL IS BULGING
AND THE PUPILS ARE DILATED.

12:19.870 --> 12:21.271
(Arizona) HIS I.V.H.
BRAIN BLEED.

12:21.271 --> 12:23.143
GIVE ME THE ULTRASOUND.
HERE YOU GO.

12:23.143 --> 12:26.016
(beeping continues)

12:26.016 --> 12:27.848
(Arizona) OKAY.
(transducer whooshing)

12:27.848 --> 12:29.950
RIGHT THERE.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.451
IT'S PROGRESSED
TO STAGE 3.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.422
HE'S GONNA NEED
A VENTRICULOSTOMY FAST,

12:32.422 --> 12:34.224
OR WE'RE LOOKING
AT HYDROCEPHALUS.

12:34.224 --> 12:35.425
AND BRAIN DAMAGE.
PAGE MARCUS.

12:35.425 --> 12:37.127
NO, SHEPHERD SHOULD TAKE THIS.
NO, HE'S IN SURGERY.

12:37.127 --> 12:38.428
JUST PAGE MARCUS.
HE CAN HANDLE IT.

12:38.428 --> 12:40.861
NO, THE KID'S GETTING SHEPHERD.
JUST WAIT FOR ME.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.763
(beeping continues)

12:48.498 --> 12:51.001
THE CYST IS DRAINING
REALLY WELL.

12:51.001 --> 12:52.502
REALLY WELL.

12:52.502 --> 12:53.904
GREAT JOB.

12:53.904 --> 12:55.375
WHOA.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.147
WHERE IS THAT BLOOD
COMING FROM?

12:57.147 --> 12:58.308
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BLEEDING.

12:58.308 --> 12:59.479
WE JUST HAVE TO FIND
THE SOURCE.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.011
LET'S EXTEND
THE CRANIOTOMY A LITTLE.

13:01.011 --> 13:02.182
OPEN HER UP MORE?

13:02.182 --> 13:03.353
YEAH. IT'S OKAY.
JUST A LITTLE.

13:03.353 --> 13:04.484
OKAY.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.456
HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.

13:06.456 --> 13:09.389
(whirring)

13:09.389 --> 13:11.391
BUT I HEAR STORIES OF PEOPLE
WAKING UP ALL THE TIME.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.863
NOT THIS. NOT BRAIN DEATH.

13:12.863 --> 13:14.324
BUT--BUT HE'S STILL BREATHING.

13:14.324 --> 13:15.495
THE MACHINE
IS BREATHING FOR HIM.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.827
WHEN WE SHUT IT OFF--
HE DIES.

13:16.827 --> 13:17.968
HE--HE'S ALREADY--

13:19.169 --> 13:20.831
YOUR HUSBAND HAS DIED.

13:20.831 --> 13:22.372
OH, GOOD.

13:22.372 --> 13:24.234
OKAY, THIS IS AN E.E.G.

13:24.234 --> 13:26.536
UH, IT'S A BRAIN SCAN
OF ANOTHER PATIENT IN A COMA,

13:26.536 --> 13:27.878
ALSO VENTILATED.

13:27.878 --> 13:29.980
THESE LINES INDICATE
BRAIN ACTIVITY.

13:29.980 --> 13:32.082
UM, YOU CAN SEE THESE SPIKES
GOING ALL THE WAY.

13:32.082 --> 13:33.884
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR HUSBAND'S,

13:33.884 --> 13:35.515
IT'S COMPLETELY FLAT.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.918
WE'VE SEEN NO BRAIN ACTIVITY
FOR THE PAST 72 HOURS--

13:37.918 --> 13:39.189
JUST STOP.

13:39.189 --> 13:40.550
WELL, I'M--I'M JUST
TRYING TO EXPLAIN--

13:40.550 --> 13:41.521
EXPLAIN TO ME

13:41.521 --> 13:43.293
HOW YOU CAN TELL ME
THAT HE'S DEAD

13:43.293 --> 13:45.896
AND THEN TELL ME TO TURN OFF
LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT.

13:45.896 --> 13:47.557
EXPLAIN THAT.

13:47.557 --> 13:48.528
(sighs) S--

13:48.528 --> 13:50.861
SAM, YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR TIME.

13:50.861 --> 13:53.163
THIS IS
A DIFFICULT DECISION.

13:53.163 --> 13:56.466
YOU SHOULD JUST BE WITH MICHAEL
AND TAKE YOUR TIME.

13:58.869 --> 14:01.271
TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED.

14:01.271 --> 14:03.573
(crying) THANK YOU.

14:03.573 --> 14:05.175
(door opens)

14:05.175 --> 14:06.846
(Emily) IT'S OKAY.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.479
IT'S OKAY.
I KNOW HOW HARD THIS IS.

14:09.479 --> 14:11.551
(Sam sniffles)

14:11.551 --> 14:12.923
(whirring)

14:12.923 --> 14:14.024
(cracks)

14:14.024 --> 14:15.185
LIKE THAT?

14:15.185 --> 14:16.356
UH-HUH. THERE IT IS.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.487
LITTLE BLEEDER.
JUST CAUTERIZE.

14:17.487 --> 14:18.458
OKAY. BIPOLAR.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.629
HERE YOU GO.

14:19.629 --> 14:22.362
(sizzling)

14:22.362 --> 14:24.164
THERE. OKAY. (exhales)

14:24.164 --> 14:25.465
LOOK AT THAT.
THAT'S HER TUMOR.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.097
WHAT?

14:27.097 --> 14:29.439
OH, MY GOD.
THERE IT IS.

14:29.439 --> 14:31.501
DO WE TAKE IT OUT?

14:31.501 --> 14:36.076
UH, WE SHOULD, UM...

14:36.076 --> 14:39.149
LET'S CALL O.R. TWO
AND FIND OUT

14:39.149 --> 14:40.951
HOW LONG
DR. SHEPHERD'S GONNA BE.

14:40.951 --> 14:43.153
I MEAN, HE SAID IT WOULD
BE EASY. THAT I-I COULD DO IT.

14:43.153 --> 14:45.355
I KNOW,
AND IT'S RIGHT THERE.

14:45.355 --> 14:46.586
THEY SAID
HE'S JUST FINISHING.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.188
HE'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.519
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S JUST WAIT

14:49.519 --> 14:51.061
AND SEE WHAT HE SAYS.

14:51.061 --> 14:52.462
OKAY.

14:52.462 --> 14:54.524
CORD'S CLEAR.
SPINE IS STABILIZED.

14:54.524 --> 14:57.067
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WELL, I THINK HIS
MOTORCYCLE DAYS ARE OVER.

14:57.067 --> 14:59.099
HOPEFULLY, HE'LL BE ABLE
TO WALK AGAIN.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.530
DR. SHEPHERD,

15:00.530 --> 15:02.232
WE NEED YOU IN O.R. FOUR.

15:02.232 --> 15:03.503
IT'S TOMMY. HE'S GOT
A GRADE-3 BLEED.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.105
HE NEEDS A VENTRIC PLACED.
KAREV, SLOW DOWN.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.376
WHO IS TOMMY?

15:06.376 --> 15:08.538
UH, MORGAN'S BABY.
THE INTERN MORGAN.

15:08.538 --> 15:10.610
ALL RIGHT. WELL, JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND, TO, UH, FINISH--

15:10.610 --> 15:13.283
CAN YOU COME NOW?
PLEASE.

15:13.283 --> 15:14.444
GO. I'LL FINISH.

15:14.444 --> 15:16.616
OKAY.
(instruments clatter)

15:16.616 --> 15:17.988
WHERE'S YOUR HOT TOURIST?

15:17.988 --> 15:19.149
YEAH, SHE'S NOT HERE
FOR A TOUR.

15:19.149 --> 15:20.490
I'M BEING SET UP.

15:20.490 --> 15:22.322
MY MOM'S TRYING TO EXPAND
THE AVERY DYNASTY.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.994
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TELL HER
WE WERE BUSY.

15:23.994 --> 15:26.126
YOU AND DR. HOTNESS
SHOULD BE GETTING BUSY,

15:26.126 --> 15:27.627
IF YOU GET MY POINT.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.459
ACTUALLY, SHE SHOULD BE
GETTING YOUR POINT.

15:29.459 --> 15:30.961
WHAT ARE YOU, 12?

15:30.961 --> 15:32.702
WHY ARE YOU SO OBSESSED
WITH ME GETTING LAID?

15:32.702 --> 15:34.564
'CAUSE IT WORKS FOR ME.

15:34.564 --> 15:36.306
IT'S CALLED
PASSING ON WISDOM.

15:36.306 --> 15:37.467
ALSO PIMPING.
(elevator bell dings)

15:37.467 --> 15:39.139
SHE'S HERE FOR ONE NIGHT.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.610
(people speaking indistinctly)

15:40.610 --> 15:42.142
(sighs) NO.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.444
I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE
MY MOTHER THE SATISFACTION.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.946
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

15:46.946 --> 15:49.449
IT'S NOT YOUR MOTHER YOU SHOULD
BE TRYING TO SATISFY.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.051
(ding)
CHILD!

15:53.683 --> 15:56.526
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

15:56.526 --> 15:57.727
SAM.

15:57.727 --> 15:59.429
(beeping continues)

15:59.429 --> 16:01.161
IS THERE...

16:01.161 --> 16:03.163
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
I CAN ANSWER?

16:03.163 --> 16:05.535
NO, THANK YOU.

16:05.535 --> 16:07.537
IF YOU COULD STOP CIRCLING
LIKE A VULTURE,

16:07.537 --> 16:09.399
I'D APPRECIATE IT.

16:09.399 --> 16:12.502
(beeping continues)

16:12.502 --> 16:14.144
(door slides)

16:17.577 --> 16:20.050
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO HIM?

16:20.050 --> 16:21.281
NO.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.582
HE JUST NEEDS TIME
TO GRIEVE, YOU KNOW,

16:22.582 --> 16:24.284
TO WORK THROUGH IT.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.655
HE NEEDS TO THINK CLEARLY.

16:25.655 --> 16:27.757
HE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

16:27.757 --> 16:29.719
HE'S LOSING HIS HUSBAND.

16:29.719 --> 16:32.122
THEY WERE GOING
TO A GROCERY STORE,

16:32.122 --> 16:34.694
JUST LIVING THEIR NICE,
BORING LIFE,

16:34.694 --> 16:37.097
GOING TO THE SAME STORE
THEY'VE GONE TO FOR 22 YEARS,

16:37.097 --> 16:39.029
AND A CAR HITS THEM.

16:39.029 --> 16:40.670
SAM NEVER SAW THIS COMING.

16:40.670 --> 16:43.603
LIKE I SAID, I JUST--
I'VE TAKEN SOME TIME

16:43.603 --> 16:45.305
TO GET TO KNOW THEM--

16:45.305 --> 16:47.607
ARE YOU MARRIED? UM,
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN MARRIED?

16:47.607 --> 16:48.578
NO.

16:48.578 --> 16:50.280
THEN STAY OUT OF IT.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.212
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.084
YOU DON'T KNOW SAM.

16:54.084 --> 16:57.047
YOU DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING
ABOUT WHAT HE NEEDS.

16:57.047 --> 16:59.189
(folder thuds)

16:59.189 --> 17:00.350
(sighs)

17:00.350 --> 17:01.691
THERE YOU ARE.

17:01.691 --> 17:03.293
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:03.293 --> 17:05.195
WE'RE FINISHED.
THE CYST IS DRAINING.

17:05.195 --> 17:06.556
SHE DID GREAT.

17:06.556 --> 17:08.398
AND GET THIS--
LEXIE RESECTED THE MENINGIOMA--

17:08.398 --> 17:09.559
PERFECT MARGINS.

17:09.559 --> 17:11.131
SHE WAS PERFECT.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.502
YOU DID WHAT?

17:12.502 --> 17:13.663
TOOK THE TUMOR OUT.

17:13.663 --> 17:15.365
WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

17:15.365 --> 17:16.606
(suction gurgles)

17:22.512 --> 17:23.473
THE PLAN WAS TO REMOVE
THE CYST.

17:23.473 --> 17:24.644
SHE DID NOT CONSENT
TO THAT SURGERY.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.815
THE TUMOR WAS RIGHT THERE.

17:25.815 --> 17:27.177
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
CLOSE HER UP

17:27.177 --> 17:28.348
AND PUT HER THROUGH
ANOTHER BRAIN SURGERY?

17:28.348 --> 17:29.419
YOU SHOULD'VE PAGED ME.

17:29.419 --> 17:31.481
I DID, TWICE.
DEREK, LORI IS FINE.

17:31.481 --> 17:33.683
LEXIE TOOK HER TO RECOVERY.
HER VITALS ARE GREAT--

17:33.683 --> 17:36.126
WE WON'T KNOW HOW SHE IS
UNTIL SHE WAKES UP.

17:36.126 --> 17:37.427
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER.

17:37.427 --> 17:38.528
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER.
GIVE ME THE SCANS.

17:38.528 --> 17:40.290
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT YOU DID IN THERE.

17:40.290 --> 17:41.831
(suction gurgles)

17:41.831 --> 17:43.363
(Catherine) POOR WOMAN.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.464
50 YEARS OLD,

17:44.464 --> 17:47.066
AND SHE HAS TO WEAR
ADULT DIAPERS TO GO ON A DATE.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.398
KIND OF TAKES THE MAGIC
OUT OF...

17:48.398 --> 17:49.539
(sexy voice)
"LET ME CHANGE INTO SOMETHING

17:49.539 --> 17:51.541
A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE."

17:51.541 --> 17:53.473
(laughs)
(Richard laughs)
YOU'RE TERRIBLE.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.705
(normal voice) SHE PROBABLY
SAVED HERSELF SOME TROUBLE.

17:55.705 --> 17:58.848
BY HER AGE, ALL THE GOOD ONES
ARE ALREADY SNAPPED UP.

17:58.848 --> 18:01.281
TRAGEDY, ISN'T IT?

18:01.281 --> 18:02.582
MM.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.284
I'M READY
WITH THIS NEW BLADDER

18:04.284 --> 18:05.515
IF ANYBODY'S INTERESTED.

18:05.515 --> 18:07.117
UH, YEAH. BRING IT
OVER HERE, DR. BAILEY.

18:07.117 --> 18:08.288
(door hisses open)

18:08.288 --> 18:09.589
DR. AVERY.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.691
I SEEM TO HAVE LOST TRACK
OF THE OTHER DR. AVERY.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.163
MAY I SCRUB IN WITH YOU?

18:13.163 --> 18:15.225
NO, YOU MAY NOT
SCRUB IN WITH ME.

18:15.225 --> 18:17.297
I GAVE YOU A JOB TO DO,
DR. KEATON.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.568
BUT SURELY--

18:18.568 --> 18:20.570
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE BENEFIT TONIGHT OR NOT?

18:20.570 --> 18:22.472
YES, MA'AM. OF COURSE.

18:22.472 --> 18:24.474
GOOD. YOU LOST HIM.
YOU GO FIND HIM.

18:24.474 --> 18:26.306
(sighs)

18:26.306 --> 18:28.808
BENEFIT? HMM.
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

18:28.808 --> 18:32.111
(door hisses open)
FUN? IT'S EXHAUSTING.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.613
ONCE UPON A TIME,
I WAS CATHERINE FOX.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.645
(door hisses closed)
EVER SINCE
I'VE BECOME AN AVERY,

18:35.645 --> 18:37.547
EVERY FUND-RAISER,
GALA-CHARITY BROUHAHA

18:37.547 --> 18:38.888
THAT COMES ALONG,

18:38.888 --> 18:41.291
I GOTTA SQUEEZE
INTO SOME PANTYHOSE,

18:41.291 --> 18:43.623
GET ZIPPED INTO A COUTURE GOWN
AND REPRESENT,

18:43.623 --> 18:45.355
AND EVERY TIME YOU GO
INTO AN O.R.,

18:45.355 --> 18:47.327
THEY EXPECT YOU TO DO

18:47.327 --> 18:49.128
HARPER AVERY
AWARD-WINNING WORK,

18:49.128 --> 18:51.561
EVEN THOUGH I CAN NEVER WIN
A HARPER AVERY.

18:51.561 --> 18:53.663
THE NAME COMES
WITH WAY TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

18:53.663 --> 18:55.535
YOU CAN CRUMBLE UNDER IT,

18:55.535 --> 18:57.367
BURN OUT.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.369
HAPPENED TO JACKSON'S FATHER.

18:59.369 --> 19:01.371
I DO NOT WANT IT
TO HAPPEN TO JACKSON.

19:01.371 --> 19:03.173
YEAH, IT'S A--IT'S A LOT
TO HOLD UP.

19:03.173 --> 19:04.414
OHH.

19:04.414 --> 19:06.876
DON'T YOU WISH YOU COULD
JUST GO BACK SOMETIMES?

19:06.876 --> 19:10.520
I WOULD LOVE TO JUST BE
CATHERINE FOX ALL OVER AGAIN.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.552
I WAS SO MUCH MORE FUN
BACK THEN.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.824
OH, YOU'RE STILL FUN NOW.

19:14.824 --> 19:16.556
I AM, HUH?

19:16.556 --> 19:18.428
GLAD YOU NOTICED.

19:18.428 --> 19:21.831
(suction gurgles)

19:21.831 --> 19:23.363
YOU TRY THE CAFETERIA, TOO?

19:23.363 --> 19:24.694
JAMBALAYA?

19:24.694 --> 19:26.696
DISGUSTING.
WHY DO THEY EVEN TRY?

19:26.696 --> 19:28.538
APRIL'S GOT, UH, YOGURT.

19:28.538 --> 19:29.569
OOH.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.701
AND LEFTOVER SOMETHING.

19:31.701 --> 19:34.774
SO LEXIE REMOVED A TUMOR
FROM A WOMAN TODAY,

19:34.774 --> 19:36.746
AND NOW DEREK'S ALL WORRIED
THAT WE GORKED HER.

19:36.746 --> 19:38.278
MM. DID YOU?

19:38.278 --> 19:39.449
NO.

19:39.449 --> 19:41.451
WELL, I'VE SPENT
THE ENTIRE MORNING

19:41.451 --> 19:43.613
WITH OWEN'S STUPID NURSE.

19:43.613 --> 19:44.554
OWEN'S NURSE.

19:44.554 --> 19:47.457
THE STUPID I.C.U. NURSE.

19:47.457 --> 19:48.618
WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU SAID.

19:48.618 --> 19:49.659
OH, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

19:49.659 --> 19:50.620
KEPNER CAN COOK.

19:50.620 --> 19:53.223
FREAKIN' JAMBALAYA DAY.

19:53.223 --> 19:55.325
IT'S LIKE
A HEARTY BOWL OF SALMONELLA.

19:55.325 --> 19:56.496
HEY, HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN SCREWING THE INTERN

19:56.496 --> 19:57.727
WITH THE PREEMIE?
WHAT?

19:57.727 --> 19:59.699
MORGAN?
I AM NOT.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.472
UH, WELL, YOU BOTH WERE IN
THE ON-CALL ROOM THIS MORNING...

20:02.472 --> 20:03.603
(lowered voice) BEFORE DAWN.

20:03.603 --> 20:04.774
YEAH, STUDYING.

20:04.774 --> 20:06.976
YOU'RE FEEDING HER.
(gasps) ALEX.

20:06.976 --> 20:08.338
NO. BAD DOG.

20:08.338 --> 20:10.740
SHUT UP. I MEAN, SHE'S...
MY INTERN

20:10.740 --> 20:12.242
AND SHE'S A PATIENT.

20:12.242 --> 20:13.413
THIS IS GONNA TURN OUT
LIKE REBECCA.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.484
OH, YEAH.
SMASHED-UP FACE?

20:14.484 --> 20:15.645
OH, THAT--THAT WAS BAD.

20:15.645 --> 20:16.816
YEAH, SHE'S GONNA FALL
FOR YOU,

20:16.816 --> 20:17.987
AND THEN SHE'S GONNA GO CRAZY

20:17.987 --> 20:19.349
AND THEN SHE'S GONNA
PEE ON MY COUCH.

20:19.349 --> 20:20.520
OH, GROSS.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.621
GO TO HELL,
THE BOTH OF YOU.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.293
OKAY, JUST KEEP HER
OFF MY COUCH, PLEASE.

20:23.293 --> 20:24.454
(laughs)

20:24.454 --> 20:25.755
ARE THINGS WITH OWEN
ANY BETTER?

20:25.755 --> 20:27.297
(woman sighs)

20:27.297 --> 20:29.299
IS THAT MY TURKEY CASSEROLE?

20:29.299 --> 20:30.630
OH, YEAH.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.432
HOW DO YOU KEEP THE CRUNCHY
ONION THINGS SO CRUNCHY?

20:32.432 --> 20:33.763
I PUT THEM IN LAST.

20:33.763 --> 20:35.735
COME ON. I LOOKED
FORWARD TO THIS ALL DAY.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.906
DELICIOUS.

20:36.906 --> 20:38.438
STOP Facebooking MY MOM,
ALL RIGHT?

20:38.438 --> 20:40.610
UH, I'M NOT.

20:40.610 --> 20:42.612
REALLY? THEN HOW DOES SHE KNOW
I BROKE UP WITH LEXIE, HMM?

20:42.612 --> 20:43.773
WHY IS SHE HERE
TRYING TO HOOK ME UP

20:43.773 --> 20:44.944
WITH SOME JUNIOR UROLOGIST?

20:44.944 --> 20:46.346
(April) HEY.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.278
HEY, THOSE ARE MINE.
THEY HAVE ELECTROLYTES.

20:48.278 --> 20:49.779
I SHOWED HER AROUND
HALF THE DAMN HOSPITAL

20:49.779 --> 20:50.750
BEFORE I REALIZED
I WAS ON A BLIND DATE.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.752
YOU TOLD ME
TO UNFRIEND HER. I DID.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.783
(knock on door)

20:53.783 --> 20:54.754
(clears throat)

20:54.754 --> 20:56.726
HI. I'M LOOKING
FOR DR. AVERY.

20:56.726 --> 20:57.887
OH, YES.
HE'S RIGHT THERE.

20:57.887 --> 20:59.859
OH. THERE YOU ARE.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.260
YEAH.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.562
SHALL WE CONTINUE?

21:02.562 --> 21:04.263
LET'S DO THAT.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.435
(elevator bell dings)

21:05.435 --> 21:06.596
THAT'S GREAT.

21:06.596 --> 21:07.737
MM-HMM.

21:07.737 --> 21:11.441
♪♪♪

21:11.441 --> 21:12.902
CRISTINA?

21:12.902 --> 21:14.544
(sighs) DROP IT.

21:14.544 --> 21:15.705
WE WERE TALKING.

21:15.705 --> 21:17.777
NO, YOU WERE TALKING.
I SAID DROP IT.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.049
I'M FINE.

21:20.049 --> 21:21.951
