[panting, screaming]

30:57.564 --> 30:59.440
[girl shushing]

30:59.524 --> 31:01.943
I'm just a regular human boy. I can talk.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.321
I can see that.

31:08.867 --> 31:09.701
Hey.

31:10.827 --> 31:11.703
Breathe.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.371

Uh, yeah.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.154
Why don't you come with me?

31:49.949 --> 31:50.950
Let go!

31:52.201 --> 31:53.328
Jepp?

31:53.411 --> 31:55.371
[Jepperd]
I told you not to talk to anyone.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.709
But I was lost,
and she… she was helping me.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.670
Anyway, I got your ticket.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.885
You can still come with me, you know?

32:09.427 --> 32:12.138
Look, I told you, this is it for us.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.681
Separate ways, remember?

32:18.227 --> 32:19.979
Come on, we better be going.

32:25.443 --> 32:26.694
[Jepperd] For the train.

32:28.738 --> 32:31.574
Smells like nuts and maple syrup and corn.

32:31.658 --> 32:32.784
[Jepperd] Kettle corn.

32:33.242 --> 32:34.494
Save it for the ride.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.996

-[clattering]

32:37.080 --> 32:40.249

32:48.424 --> 32:49.676
What did you just say?

32:49.759 --> 32:51.177
Those men.

32:51.260 --> 32:53.680
They have lots
of your candy in those boxes.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.766

33:02.897 --> 33:04.774
[Jepperd] You know what, kid?

33:04.857 --> 33:07.485
I think there's
one last thing we have to do.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.029
[Gus] But what about the train?

33:10.113 --> 33:12.365
Don't worry, I won't let you miss it.

33:13.199 --> 33:14.075
I promise.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.493

Hey, keep it down.

Atta boy.

33:47.108 --> 33:50.069
[lock rattling]

33:54.365 --> 33:56.242
Okay, which box?

33:56.951 --> 33:59.203
Everything kind of
smells the same in here.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.830
[Last Man] Close the rest of these up…

34:00.913 --> 34:02.665
You gotta hurry, kid.

34:04.792 --> 34:05.835
It's here. That smell.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.004
-You sure?
-Positive.

34:10.631 --> 34:11.507
Hey.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.093
You're not supposed to be here.

34:14.177 --> 34:17.013

Oh, my Lord.

Come on.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.252
All right.

34:48.336 --> 34:51.172

35:47.728 --> 35:50.356
Get on the train right now.

35:50.439 --> 35:53.317
Go to the furthest carriage
in the back right away,

35:53.401 --> 35:56.154
and don't do any weird deer shit.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.374
What do I do when I get there?

36:09.792 --> 36:12.837
You're Sweet Tooth.
You'll think of something.
