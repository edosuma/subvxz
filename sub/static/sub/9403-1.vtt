13:26.031 --> 13:27.264
Okay.

13:27.316 --> 13:29.617
These outfits are adorable,
Brooke!

13:29.701 --> 13:30.868
Thank you.

13:30.936 --> 13:34.071
I made them,
which brings me to this.

13:34.122 --> 13:36.273
I have an idea
for a new line.

13:36.325 --> 13:38.876
Oh, but you already
had baby Brooke.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.828
Yes,
I <i>did</i> have baby Brooke.

13:40.913 --> 13:43.414
But thanks to you,
I no longer have it,

13:43.465 --> 13:44.916
or any of my wealth.

13:44.967 --> 13:47.752
Yeah. Thank you, Victoria

13:47.803 --> 13:50.054
and Millie the crackhead,
yes, yes.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.389
You love me so much.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.341
And besides, that was for girls.

13:53.425 --> 13:57.428
This would be for boys,
and we'd call it...

13:58.764 --> 14:01.632
Should we tell grandma
what it's called?

14:01.683 --> 14:05.686
Should we say "paddy cake,
paddy cake, baker man"?

14:05.771 --> 14:10.574
A line of designer duds
for your little man...Or men.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.476
We could start over, mom.

14:12.527 --> 14:13.811
What do you think?

14:13.862 --> 14:15.145
Yeah. We will, honey.

14:15.197 --> 14:16.580
It's just that, you know,

14:16.648 --> 14:18.833
the way that
the men's line struggled

14:18.917 --> 14:20.167
and with the economy
the way it is...

14:20.252 --> 14:22.536
Yeah. It's okay.
It was just an idea.

14:22.621 --> 14:24.255
No, but we'll find it,
sweetie.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.790
Now, do you need help
with the christening tomorrow?

14:25.841 --> 14:28.709
No. We'll just meet
at the church.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.095
By the way,
I invited daddy.

14:31.162 --> 14:33.214
Why on earth
would you do that?

14:33.298 --> 14:35.349
Because I asked him
to be a godparent.

14:35.434 --> 14:36.684
Your father?

14:36.768 --> 14:39.720
Does he even know
you have children?

14:39.805 --> 14:41.171
He said he would.

14:41.223 --> 14:42.890
Well, he said
he'd be at your wedding.

14:42.975 --> 14:44.174
He lies.

14:44.226 --> 14:45.726
Whatever makes you think
he'll change?

14:47.512 --> 14:48.863
<i>You</i> did.

14:51.867 --> 14:54.735
They're his grandchildren,
too, mom.

14:54.820 --> 14:56.687
He should know them.

15:05.163 --> 15:07.798
Hey.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.033
Hi.

15:09.084 --> 15:10.334
Pretty good, huh?

15:10.385 --> 15:12.887
What? I-I can't hear you
over this crappy song.
What? I-I can't hear you
over this crappy song.

15:14.172 --> 15:16.307
Don't call
my song crappy.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.709
It's the truth.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.345
Well, actually,
the song is good,

15:21.396 --> 15:24.482
and you're good, but this
production's all wrong.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.318
Where's the slide guitar

15:27.385 --> 15:28.552
It's an acoustic track.

15:28.603 --> 15:29.820
It's crappy.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.238
<i>You're</i> crappy.

15:31.323 --> 15:34.575
Look... if you want someone
to tell you how great you are,

15:34.659 --> 15:36.110
go talk to your boyfriend.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.864
Okay. Chris Keller
was hoping you'd say,

15:39.915 --> 15:41.582
"I don't have a boyfriend,"

15:41.666 --> 15:43.918
but that doesn't really matter,
does it?

15:44.002 --> 15:45.169
What's that
supposed to mean?

15:45.236 --> 15:46.754
It means you're an actress.

15:46.838 --> 15:48.172
What's <i>that
supposed to mean?</i>

15:48.256 --> 15:50.291
It means you're used
to being treated special.

15:50.358 --> 15:52.793
It means you need constant
praise and positive feedback.

15:52.878 --> 15:55.012
It means you stand there
with your arms crossed,

15:55.080 --> 15:56.847
staring at me
with this really sexy pout

15:56.915 --> 15:58.682
when you have to hear
that this version

15:58.750 --> 16:02.169
of your probably not-bad song
<i>is</i> crappy.

16:02.237 --> 16:05.106
It's unbelievable
how much I hate you.

16:05.190 --> 16:07.641
Nice.

16:07.726 --> 16:10.361
See, in the movies,
this is sexual tension.

16:10.428 --> 16:11.612
We argue first,

16:11.696 --> 16:14.448
and then slowly you start
to like Chris Keller,

16:14.533 --> 16:15.766
and then we do it.

16:15.834 --> 16:18.569
We can skip the "slowly" part
if you want to.

16:18.620 --> 16:21.238
I hate you.

16:21.289 --> 16:23.707
I hate you!

16:23.775 --> 16:25.693
The song's crappy!

16:25.761 --> 16:28.662
That ass is not.

16:31.282 --> 16:35.219
Stupid, lying, arrogant,
third-person-talking jerk!

16:36.571 --> 16:38.439
Hey.

16:38.507 --> 16:41.342
Should I put
my pants back on?

16:44.679 --> 16:46.230
Remember when you were
a little kid

16:46.297 --> 16:48.099
and it was impossible
for your parents

16:48.150 --> 16:50.684
to get you to go to bed?

16:50.769 --> 16:53.303
Now I can't wait to sleep.

16:53.355 --> 16:55.406
It's probably because
you've been walking around

16:55.473 --> 16:57.641
like a zombie every night
and your body's exhausted.

16:57.692 --> 16:58.692
Not every night.

16:58.777 --> 17:00.661
Not tonight.
You'll see.

39:05.494 --> 39:09.631
The only thing better
than waking up with you

39:09.682 --> 39:12.351
is ending the night
with you.

39:14.470 --> 39:15.887
Hmm.

39:17.607 --> 39:19.507
♪ Believe me

39:39.245 --> 39:43.732
♪ I got wise and I got old

39:49.922 --> 39:53.175
♪ so don't you now

40:12.045 --> 40:16.498
♪ some land holds a home

40:16.565 --> 40:22.788
♪ some of my years only hold

40:22.872 --> 40:25.207
♪ me to roam

40:28.428 --> 40:33.248
♪ but I tell myself it's true

40:38.855 --> 40:43.108
♪ you see it, too

40:43.192 --> 40:46.445
♪ and I say don't you know...

40:54.153 --> 40:56.505
Yeah,
there's your little bear.

40:56.572 --> 40:58.457
Let's take a look.

40:58.541 --> 41:02.294
Oh, you got your bear?
Did you get your bear? Yeah?
Oh, you got your bear?
Did you get your bear

41:02.378 --> 41:04.796
<i>People say hell is endless.</i>

41:04.881 --> 41:06.614
Oh, it's so exciting.

41:06.666 --> 41:08.950
<i>They say
it's our worst nightmare...</i>

41:09.001 --> 41:14.289
<i>The face of our darkness.</i>

41:14.340 --> 41:16.591
Hello, son.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.393
Welcome home.

41:18.461 --> 41:19.761
<i>But whatever it is,</i>

41:19.812 --> 41:21.897
<i>however it is,</i>

41:21.964 --> 41:24.983
<i>I say hell is empty...</i>

41:25.068 --> 41:28.120
<i>And all the devils are here.</i>
