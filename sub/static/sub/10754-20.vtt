WEBVTT

00:10.718 --> 00:15.014
That's it for today.
Goodbye and good listening.

00:16.599 --> 00:20.686
Little off our game today, Roz.
Is something wrong?

00:20.853 --> 00:23.439
Yes. I told a guy I love him.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.941
Somebody you know this time?

00:28.527 --> 00:30.988
You hate to hear about my love life.

00:31.155 --> 00:35.618
No, I care about you. lf you have
a problem and I can help, I'd love to.

00:35.784 --> 00:38.829
Just keep the details
on a need-to-know basis.

00:40.080 --> 00:45.127
We've dated a couple of weeks
and last night he licked behind my ears...

00:45.294 --> 00:49.214
- Roz, is this...?
- Yes, you do need to know this.

00:51.050 --> 00:55.095
Anyway, what I meant to say was,
"l love that."

00:55.262 --> 00:58.307
But I yelled out, "l love you!"

00:58.474 --> 01:03.771
He got a look on his face like
Indiana Jones running from the big ball.

01:04.688 --> 01:07.524
Do you love him?

01:07.691 --> 01:12.362
No, but I said it, so he should've
said it back. It's just polite.

01:12.529 --> 01:17.409
There is no more emotionally-charged
phrase than "l love you".

01:17.576 --> 01:20.704
Some people can't say it.
It makes them too vulnerable.

01:20.871 --> 01:26.043
My father's incapable of saying it,
even to me. But I know he does.

01:26.209 --> 01:30.922
He never told you he loves you?
God, that explains so much.

01:31.089 --> 01:33.675
What does that mean?

01:33.842 --> 01:36.845
You're so needy
that when a friend asks your advice,

01:37.012 --> 01:39.973
you steer the conversation
back to your own problems.

01:40.140 --> 01:44.519
Anyway, I told this guy I love him.
How do I take it back?

01:44.686 --> 01:48.648
Remember I said I cared about you
and I'd like to help?

01:48.815 --> 01:51.276
I take it back.

01:56.740 --> 01:58.783
(Eddie growls)

01:59.701 --> 02:03.288
Get out of there!
You'll get a fish-hook up your nose.

02:03.455 --> 02:05.957
Don't you ever clean that thing out?

02:06.124 --> 02:08.585
No, it's bad luck.

02:08.752 --> 02:13.923
You show up on a fishing trip with
a tackle box that doesn't smell rotten

02:14.090 --> 02:16.342
and nobody will sit next to you.

02:17.844 --> 02:20.805
My multiple personality patients did that.

02:20.972 --> 02:24.225
They'd say the other one
had sent the cheque.

02:26.227 --> 02:28.479
What an odd combination of odours.

02:28.646 --> 02:33.735
Smells like a fish died
and all the other fish sent flowers.

02:35.737 --> 02:40.408
Yes, it's time for Dad's annual
ice fishing trip to Lake Nomahegan.

02:40.575 --> 02:42.619
Getting ready.

02:42.785 --> 02:47.373
Duke rented a cabin on the lake
and I'm bringing the bait and pork rinds.

02:47.540 --> 02:52.003
I don't want you boys
throwing any wild parties.

02:52.170 --> 02:55.339
How can we
if you're taking all the pork rinds?

02:56.799 --> 03:01.637
How could a fish be so dumb
as to put its mouth around... Ouch!

03:03.264 --> 03:05.308
(Phone rings)

03:07.143 --> 03:10.646
Hello? Yes, he's right here.

03:10.813 --> 03:13.107
It's Duke.

03:13.274 --> 03:15.526
Hey, Duke!

03:16.611 --> 03:18.654
I'm sorry.

03:20.031 --> 03:23.617
Sure I understand.
We'll do it next year.

03:23.784 --> 03:27.371
We got too many good times
to let this tradition die.

03:27.538 --> 03:31.542
Yeah. Yeah, I love ya, ya big lug.

03:33.127 --> 03:35.880
OK, bye.

03:37.465 --> 03:41.427
- Your trip's been cancelled?
- Duke's back's out again.

03:41.594 --> 03:45.222
What a shame.
You were so looking forward to it.

03:45.389 --> 03:49.727
I still have the cabin,
but I can't go alone.

03:52.688 --> 03:58.402
As much as I'd like to do something
with you, ice fishing just isn't it.

03:59.611 --> 04:04.867
I know! They're doing a revival of
"The Iceman Cometh" downtown.

04:05.951 --> 04:10.414
We could catch a matinee, go out
for sushi and stay in the same theme.

04:11.498 --> 04:13.667
Thanks anyway.

04:13.834 --> 04:18.213
I used to enjoy waiting
for the men to return with their catch.

04:18.380 --> 04:24.803
My brothers' friends would come back,
their chiselled faces all ruddy.

04:24.970 --> 04:29.474
They were so masculine!
I couldn't wait to panfry their kippers.

04:30.684 --> 04:32.728
I'll go ice fishing, Dad.

04:35.439 --> 04:38.483
- Really?
- Unless you don't want me to.

04:38.650 --> 04:40.694
No, this will be great!

04:40.861 --> 04:42.904
- You? Ice fishing?
- Why not?

04:43.071 --> 04:46.199
I see myself
as a man of the great alfresco.

04:47.409 --> 04:50.871
You get a runny nose
watching figure skating on TV.

04:52.122 --> 04:56.918
- Thanks, Niles.
- Anything to save your trip for you.

04:57.085 --> 04:59.754
Quite a gesture, but ice fishing?

04:59.921 --> 05:04.926
In an Arctic tundra where large men
spit and it freezes in their beards?

05:05.093 --> 05:08.972
After you've seen Maris's dance group
performing in the garden,

05:09.139 --> 05:11.683
the wilderness holds no terror.

05:17.188 --> 05:20.442
- Morning.
- Good morning. Lovely day, isn't it?

05:20.608 --> 05:22.819
You're in a good mood.

05:22.986 --> 05:27.240
With your father gone,
it'll be a wonderful weekend.

05:27.407 --> 05:30.034
Care to make it perfect?

05:35.790 --> 05:39.043
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I am staying.

05:40.795 --> 05:44.215
I found the Thermos!
Make that coffee extra strong!

05:45.300 --> 05:47.343
How you doing?

05:47.510 --> 05:52.640
I know you wanna go with me
but it will be too cold for you.

05:52.807 --> 05:55.935
Yeah, I love ya, ya little mutt.

05:57.895 --> 06:00.523
I'd better make sure I have everything.

06:04.527 --> 06:07.780
Did he just say,
"l love you" to the dog?

06:07.947 --> 06:12.618
My aunt used to say, "Good night,
Mr Van der Pump" to a hat rack.

06:16.539 --> 06:18.916
Does he say that to Eddie a lot?

06:19.083 --> 06:21.752
I try to give them their privacy.

06:23.754 --> 06:26.090
Sorry, I'm just curious.

06:26.257 --> 06:28.384
I don't want to sound maudlin,

06:28.551 --> 06:31.846
but I can't remember Dad
ever saying that to me.

06:32.013 --> 06:34.765
You know he's a crusty old git.

06:34.932 --> 06:39.186
Yes, but he says it to Eddie
and he said it to Duke on the phone.

06:39.353 --> 06:42.648
Duke and your father go way back.
He's his chum.

06:42.815 --> 06:45.568
And I'm not?

06:45.734 --> 06:49.822
When your dad wants to go fishing,
at least you could go with him.

06:50.865 --> 06:55.369
You're suggesting
that I pretend that I'm enjoying myself

06:55.536 --> 06:58.038
just to hear the words "l love you"?

06:58.205 --> 07:01.375
Women have been doing it
for centuries.

07:03.877 --> 07:05.963
(Doorbell)

07:07.000 --> 07:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:15.931 --> 07:18.267
Call me Ishmael.

07:20.978 --> 07:25.524
Look at you! Are you sure
you're gonna be warm enough?

07:25.691 --> 07:29.319
I dressed in layers.
Polo, Eddie Bauer and Timberland.

07:30.529 --> 07:33.532
You look like a skinny Elmer Fudd.

07:36.076 --> 07:38.954
Wait till you see the stuff I got!

07:39.121 --> 07:43.917
I had no idea I liked fishing
till I realised all the shopping involved.

07:44.084 --> 07:46.420
Graphite poles...

07:46.586 --> 07:49.631
and...Hot Buns.

07:50.966 --> 07:55.804
You microwave them
and they stay toasty warm for hours.

07:55.971 --> 07:58.515
Dad, maybe I was a little hasty...

07:58.682 --> 08:01.059
Here we are.
Some snacks for the trip.

08:02.310 --> 08:04.813
Look at you in your new togs!

08:04.980 --> 08:07.816
The fish will see him coming.

08:07.983 --> 08:10.360
The salesmen certainly did.

08:12.821 --> 08:16.283
Dad, I feel bad that I turned you down.

08:16.449 --> 08:20.453
- Don't worry about it.
- Taste this smoked turkey jerky.

08:22.789 --> 08:26.042
Why don't you just ask him?

08:26.209 --> 08:29.129
How can I? I said I didn't want to go.

08:29.295 --> 08:31.339
- Delicious!
- Don't...

08:31.506 --> 08:34.801
- Come on, it's getting late.
- Let's hit the road.

08:34.967 --> 08:37.720
Are you sure you're up to the drive?

08:39.264 --> 08:42.976
I'm getting some mixed signals.
Do you want to go with us?

08:43.142 --> 08:48.064
All right! Better than hearing you
nag all the time! Fine! I'll go!

08:56.781 --> 08:58.825
(Wind howls)

09:01.244 --> 09:03.287
Well, this is...

09:04.372 --> 09:09.418
The ice isn't gonna break. This lake
has been frozen for three months.

09:11.129 --> 09:13.172
I'm sorry, Dad.

09:13.339 --> 09:19.178
When you said a cabin on the lake,
this is not what I had in mind.

09:19.345 --> 09:21.389
It's a cabin, it's on the lake.

09:21.556 --> 09:24.350
lf it gets warmer, it'll be in the lake.

09:27.311 --> 09:31.607
That was amazing!
I've never felt so in touch with nature!

09:31.774 --> 09:35.695
For the first time in my life,
I just urinated outdoors!

09:40.282 --> 09:44.328
Another cup of coffee,
I'll go back and dot the "i".

09:44.495 --> 09:47.957
Dad, this is great!

09:48.124 --> 09:51.418
- Frasier doesn't think so.
- I'm not complaining.

09:51.585 --> 09:58.300
It's just that I thought it would be
something more...lake-adjacent.

10:00.427 --> 10:03.138
We're actually going to sleep in here?

10:03.305 --> 10:05.516
Who is this rube?

10:07.393 --> 10:11.397
Maybe we can trick him into touching
his tongue to the bait bucket!

10:13.482 --> 10:15.984
No, we're sleeping someplace else.

10:16.151 --> 10:20.364
Just off the highway
is the Bed and Bass Motel.

10:20.531 --> 10:25.244
Bed and Bass.
One of the finer fish-themed hotels.

10:27.121 --> 10:29.164
So what do we do?

10:30.249 --> 10:34.336
We make a hole in the ice
with this thing and start fishing?

10:34.503 --> 10:36.547
It's called an auger.

10:36.713 --> 10:39.508
Well, imagine my embarrassment.

10:40.968 --> 10:43.345
- Here's your Hot Buns, Dad.
- Thanks.

10:44.262 --> 10:47.891
- What am I gonna sit on?
- The auger's free.

10:48.809 --> 10:50.936
All right, come on. Here.

11:06.827 --> 11:08.870
I saw that.

11:10.664 --> 11:15.919
I am simply wondering how long we've
been sitting here enjoying ourselves.

11:17.504 --> 11:22.133
lf the fish aren't peckish,
we'll pass the time in good conversation.

11:22.300 --> 11:27.055
This lake was formed by the retreat
of glaciers in the Cenozoic era.

11:27.222 --> 11:31.684
Which was the last time
anyone caught a fish in it.

11:33.853 --> 11:35.897
How do you know that, Niles?

11:36.064 --> 11:40.902
I read it in "Fielding's Geological
History of Western Canada".

11:41.069 --> 11:46.783
This very lake is 89 metres deep
and boasts 50 varieties of fish!

11:46.950 --> 11:49.911
Oh, Alex,
I'll take bodies of water for 500.

11:54.666 --> 11:57.669
It has lake trout,
rainbow trout, walleyed pike...

11:57.835 --> 12:00.463
How would you like to sleep with them?

12:00.630 --> 12:04.175
You could learn a thing or two
about getting into the spirit of things.

12:04.342 --> 12:08.846
I'm hungry and tired of trying
to warm up one bun at a time...

12:09.013 --> 12:11.057
in 20-degree weather!

12:11.224 --> 12:13.935
That's negative six degrees Celsius,

12:14.102 --> 12:17.438
a system named after
the Swedish astronomer

12:17.605 --> 12:20.107
and compulsive temperature taker!

12:21.943 --> 12:23.986
Niles, switch!

12:29.075 --> 12:31.577
- You're on my side.
- I am not.

12:31.744 --> 12:36.707
- You've crossed the border.
- I don't know why I'm here!

12:36.874 --> 12:39.877
Why don't you just
head back to the Bed and Bass?

12:40.044 --> 12:44.799
Just what I need -
a five-mile hike in freezing weather!

12:44.965 --> 12:47.968
- Take the car and pick us up later.
- Fine.

12:48.135 --> 12:51.138
- There's a hole in my pocket!
- You lost the keys?

12:51.305 --> 12:54.266
- Where?
- lf I knew, they wouldn't be lost!

12:54.433 --> 12:58.687
- Between here and the car.
- And it's been snowing all day.

12:58.854 --> 13:01.774
Great. We'll have to stay here all night!

13:01.941 --> 13:06.070
By morning,
we'll be frozen entrees for wolves!

13:06.237 --> 13:08.447
Wait! Is that them over there?

13:09.615 --> 13:13.118
- Thank God!
- Give me those right now.

13:13.285 --> 13:15.621
Fine, Mr Big Brother.

13:18.415 --> 13:21.543
- Nice catch.
- Me? You throw like a girl!

13:22.711 --> 13:29.051
Don't panic. We'll be fine here.
This happened to me and Duke.

13:29.218 --> 13:33.680
- You dropped your car keys?
- We're not idiots. The battery died.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.891
The three of us were just fine.

13:36.058 --> 13:40.729
- You, Duke and who?
- My drinking buddy, Mr James Beam.

13:40.896 --> 13:44.066
I got some fishing supplies, too.

13:44.233 --> 13:48.445
I never thought I'd end up
yearning for the Bed and Bass.

13:51.823 --> 13:54.326
- Niles?
- Yes, please.

13:59.664 --> 14:02.084
(Cracking)

14:06.797 --> 14:08.840
My God, what was that?

14:09.007 --> 14:11.802
Just the ice cracking underneath us.

14:13.178 --> 14:15.514
Relax. It happens all the time.

14:15.680 --> 14:21.353
lf we do fall in, we'll have 90 seconds
until hypothermia sets in.

14:21.519 --> 14:24.439
One more fact, you're going in that hole!

14:25.148 --> 14:28.401
- The walleyed pike...
- That's enough!

14:29.235 --> 14:32.322
Will you guys stop
going after each other?

14:32.489 --> 14:35.450
We're gonna lighten things up.

14:35.617 --> 14:38.536
We're drinking.
We need a drinking song.

14:40.622 --> 14:45.418
There is a great drinking song
from "La Traviata". "Libiamo Brindisi".

14:45.585 --> 14:49.088
- That's from "Rigoletto".
- It's from "La Traviata".

14:49.255 --> 14:51.382
(Singing "Libiamo Brindisi")

15:07.857 --> 15:10.276
That was great!

15:10.443 --> 15:14.364
- What's the second verse?
- I don't know. It's in Italian!

15:16.282 --> 15:19.327
- Another drink?
- No, I'll pass on that.

15:19.494 --> 15:21.537
I gotta go use the facilities.

15:21.704 --> 15:25.625
But I'll be right back. So keep
a light on in the window for me.

15:27.793 --> 15:30.379
I'm still thirsty, Niles. Beam me up!

15:40.473 --> 15:43.225
Can I ask you a personal question?

15:43.392 --> 15:46.520
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What?

15:46.687 --> 15:49.940
This Sergeant-Niles-of-the-Yukon act.

15:50.107 --> 15:53.819
- It can't be all to impress Daphne.
- It's not an act.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.864
I've never heard you comment on fish,

15:57.031 --> 16:00.159
except to say that
the sauce had separated.

16:00.326 --> 16:04.330
All right, I'll tell you.
You promise not to laugh?

16:04.497 --> 16:07.750
You'll have to take that hat off.

16:11.212 --> 16:15.341
When you took Dad in I thought
I was getting away with something.

16:15.507 --> 16:21.055
But watching you two get closer,
I thought maybe I was missing out.

16:21.221 --> 16:23.265
You want him?

16:24.183 --> 16:26.727
No, let me finish.

16:30.314 --> 16:33.233
I just feel the need
to make a connection.

16:33.400 --> 16:37.946
You've made a connection.
It just seems a bit extreme.

16:38.113 --> 16:42.493
You could've just taken him
to Captain Andy's Surf and Turf.

16:42.659 --> 16:46.205
And miss out on the fun
of memorising useless fish facts

16:46.371 --> 16:50.083
and buying a battery-operated
wardrobe?

16:50.250 --> 16:52.836
So you're having
just as bad a time as I am?

16:53.003 --> 16:54.838
Worse.

16:55.922 --> 16:59.676
You have the fun of complaining.
I have to feign enthusiasm.

17:03.305 --> 17:07.099
I really am king of the ninnies, aren't I?

17:07.267 --> 17:10.060
Don't be reaching for that sceptre yet.

17:11.313 --> 17:13.732
Wanna know the reason
I came up here?

17:15.108 --> 17:18.444
Just to hear him
say the words "l love you".

17:18.612 --> 17:20.989
What?

17:21.156 --> 17:25.785
He said it to Duke, he said it to Eddie.
He's never said to me.

17:25.952 --> 17:29.205
Surely you don't put yourself
up there with Eddie.

17:34.919 --> 17:37.255
You know he loves you.

17:37.422 --> 17:40.633
Of course. I am being ridiculous.
Look at the guy.

17:40.800 --> 17:47.098
He's content to sit here freezing his
buns off because we're here with him.

17:47.265 --> 17:50.685
I just got a little obsessed
about hearing it.

17:50.852 --> 17:54.856
You know that Maris loves you,
but it's still nice to hear it.

17:55.023 --> 17:58.860
I imagine it would be,
but let's stick to attainable goals.

18:02.447 --> 18:05.950
As they laughed
the laugh of the damned.

18:09.287 --> 18:12.498
I did it! I wrote my name!

18:12.665 --> 18:16.210
I had to borrow an "n" from Niles,
but I did it!

18:16.377 --> 18:19.797
You're leaving quite
a urological crossword puzzle.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.635
So what were you guys laughing at?

18:24.802 --> 18:28.598
- Oh, nothing.
- Don't leave your old man out.

18:30.349 --> 18:32.727
All right.

18:32.894 --> 18:38.774
I was explaining to Niles the reason
I drove all this way up here was...

18:38.941 --> 18:42.153
I was hoping to hear you say,
"l love you."

18:42.320 --> 18:46.574
I leave you for two minutes,
and you have to start thinking!

18:47.575 --> 18:50.328
Isn't it enough
that we're having a good time?

18:50.494 --> 18:51.912
Dad...

18:52.079 --> 18:56.834
Thousands of guys go fishing
and love never enters into it.

18:58.669 --> 19:01.505
- Can we just go on fishing?
- Sure.

19:01.672 --> 19:06.510
A fisherman in Wisconsin
stared into a hole for 20 years

19:06.677 --> 19:09.471
before he caught his first fish.

19:09.638 --> 19:12.725
Haven't we been here that long?

19:12.892 --> 19:16.937
Just because I didn't say it,
doesn't mean I don't feel it.

19:17.104 --> 19:19.523
That's exactly what we were saying.

19:20.941 --> 19:23.611
My dad never said it,
but I know he felt it.

19:23.777 --> 19:26.947
Feeling it is the same as saying it.

19:27.114 --> 19:30.826
- You don't have to say it.
- Did it ever occur to you that...

19:33.287 --> 19:35.414
maybe I wanna say it?

19:37.666 --> 19:42.045
Your mother used to get all over me
about not saying stuff, too.

19:46.550 --> 19:49.428
I can't say it if you're looking at me.

19:54.808 --> 19:57.352
Would it help you if we left?

20:00.022 --> 20:02.941
Just for that I'm doing you second.

20:04.901 --> 20:07.654
I don't know why it's so hard.

20:07.821 --> 20:10.866
You can say it. You said it to Duke.

20:11.033 --> 20:15.328
That's different. I said, "l love ya." Ya!

20:17.289 --> 20:19.332
We'd take "ya"!

20:19.499 --> 20:21.334
Yeah.

20:21.501 --> 20:24.629
lf I'm gonna do it, I'll do it right.

20:28.341 --> 20:30.719
Frasier...

20:41.604 --> 20:43.982
Frasier...

20:46.776 --> 20:48.820
I love you.

20:50.488 --> 20:52.574
Niles...

20:53.366 --> 20:55.410
I love you.

20:57.078 --> 20:59.831
Thanks, Dad.

20:59.998 --> 21:02.375
I love you, too.

21:02.542 --> 21:04.669
And I love you, too.

21:06.504 --> 21:09.299
But I hate ice fishing!

21:12.719 --> 21:15.305
It's the last time you'll have to do that.

21:15.471 --> 21:18.558
In that case, I really love you.

21:18.725 --> 21:21.310
- Thanks.
- Look, that's so cute!

21:21.477 --> 21:24.772
When you say it to him, he blushes.
I love you.

21:24.939 --> 21:27.692
- Cut it out!
- I love you.

21:27.859 --> 21:30.945
- Now, come on! Stop it!
- Give us a kiss.

21:32.864 --> 21:36.033
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Officer!

21:36.200 --> 21:40.079
- You have to come off the ice.
- We've lost the car keys.

21:40.246 --> 21:43.624
I'll take you to a motel
and you can call a locksmith.

21:43.791 --> 21:47.545
- Wonderful idea.
- Thank you. We love you.

21:48.879 --> 21:52.300
Ya. We love ya.

21:52.466 --> 21:55.219
We've been drinking a little.

22:01.017 --> 22:05.855
# Baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:06.021 --> 22:07.982
# Oh, my!

22:08.149 --> 22:14.989
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:15.156 --> 22:21.787
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:21.954 --> 22:24.248
# They're calling again

22:24.415 --> 22:27.501
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

22:27.668 --> 22:31.630
# What is a boy to do? #

22:31.797 --> 22:34.967
Thank you!
