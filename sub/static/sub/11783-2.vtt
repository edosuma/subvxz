40:35.767 --> 40:36.893
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING

40:35.767 --> 40:36.893
TO COME BACK FOR.

40:36.935 --> 40:40.355
HE LITERALLY

40:36.935 --> 40:40.355
BET THE WHOLE HOUSE ON TANK.

40:40.397 --> 40:42.065
SO ALL THAT MONEY'S GONE?

40:42.107 --> 40:45.110
WELL, YOU SEE, NOT EXACTLY.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.612
ENGEL? DID YOU PLACE THAT BET?

40:47.653 --> 40:50.282
YEAH. WASN'T EASY.

40:50.323 --> 40:52.284
NO ONE LOCAL WOULD HANDLE

40:50.323 --> 40:52.284
THAT KIND OF ACTION,

40:52.325 --> 40:53.451
SO I HAD TO LAY IT OFF

40:53.492 --> 40:54.369
ON A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT

40:57.705 --> 41:00.541
WHERE'S YOUR COUSIN JIMMY NOW?

41:02.210 --> 41:04.379
YOU TOOK A HELL OF A POUNDING.

41:04.421 --> 41:06.756
WE SHOULD GET YOU A CT SCAN.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.801
YOU COULD HAVE

41:06.798 --> 41:09.801
INTERNAL BLEEDING.

41:09.842 --> 41:13.096
YOU LET YOURSELF GET HAMMERED

41:09.842 --> 41:13.096
LIKE THAT ON PURPOSE?

41:13.138 --> 41:16.057
THAT'S A HELL OF A LOT

41:13.138 --> 41:16.057
OF PUNISHMENT TO TAKE.

41:16.099 --> 41:18.101
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

41:25.275 --> 41:26.859
A FRESH START.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.654
THEY JUST NEED

41:26.901 --> 41:29.654
A LITTLE DIRECTION.

41:29.695 --> 41:32.490
I MEAN, THE PLACE COULD USE

41:29.695 --> 41:32.490
SOME SPIT AND POLISH,

41:32.531 --> 41:33.616
BUT IT'S SOLID.

41:33.658 --> 41:34.867
YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE

41:33.658 --> 41:34.867

BUT YOU KNOW THE SPORT.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.849
THEY'RE FIGHTERS. LIKE YOU.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.643
YOU TREAT THEM THAT WAY,

41:57.890 --> 42:00.643

42:17.869 --> 42:19.996
THOSE HEAVY BAGS OUT OF THE WAY,

42:20.038 --> 42:21.998
WE COULD MAKE ROOM

42:20.038 --> 42:21.998
FOR A VIDEO STATION.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.333
YEAH.

42:23.375 --> 42:25.543
PUT SOME MATS DOWN,

42:23.375 --> 42:25.543
GET SOME GRAPPLING DUMMIES.

42:25.584 --> 42:26.544
