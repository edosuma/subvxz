00:04.638 --> 00:06.379
I'm a lady who lives out on a limb.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.976
A limb can break under you, you know.

00:08.041 --> 00:09.816
I lost something last night,

00:09.877 --> 00:11.447
and I think maybe you found it.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.459
I want to race.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.225
Only if I can arrange the proper protection.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.293
I'm not crazy about the idea of killing her.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.995
Either you take her down,
or she takes us down.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074

02:57.778 --> 02:58.813
Roan?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.756
Cole! What are you doing here?

03:00.814 --> 03:04.159
I was picking up a few things
before I headed up to Reno.

03:04.217 --> 03:06.697
What were you doing in the old man's office?

03:06.753 --> 03:08.198
You know, he left this afternoon.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.962
I know. I left him a note.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.435
I wanted to visit some
friends up in Lake Tahoe.

03:13.593 --> 03:15.869
You could've told him in Reno tomorrow.

03:16.329 --> 03:19.867
Oh, I will. I just wanted to make it
official. You know, put it in writing.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.705
Are you going out?

03:23.770 --> 03:24.840
- Yeah.
- Okay.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.179
- Hi.
- Good evening.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.487
You got that plane ready to race tomorrow?

03:35.549 --> 03:38.189
Always. How about the Sea Fury?

03:38.251 --> 03:39.389
I just had it overhauled.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.898
I got a place special on my mantle

03:40.954 --> 03:42.695
where I gotta set that big, huge trophy

03:42.756 --> 03:45.168
that's gonna say:
"Reno Air Races, 1st Place."

03:45.225 --> 03:48.502
Is that so? Afraid I might have
something to say about that.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.007
Yeah, I know.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.100
But since we drew different heats,

03:52.365 --> 03:54.208
so maybe I'll see you in the finals.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.376
I'll be there if you are.

03:56.636 --> 03:57.808
Good luck.

04:02.642 --> 04:03.985
Yeah, this is Security.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.251
We better contact Mr. Stappleford.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.757
We got a problem.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.733
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

04:19.793 --> 04:22.535
and welcome to the 22nd
Annual Reno Air Races.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.543
This is going to be the biggest
and the best event ever.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.273
We have 32 heats of racing in 4 classes:

04:28.335 --> 04:32.477
Formula, AT-6, Sports Biplane and Unlimited.

04:32.539 --> 04:36.510
We have dozens of exhibits featuring
aircraft from every era of flying.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.284
You'll be entertained by the
world-famous Blue Angels,

04:39.346 --> 04:41.690
the Army's Golden Knights Parachute Team,

04:41.748 --> 04:44.957
the extraordinary Christen
Eagles Acrobatic Flight Team,

04:45.018 --> 04:47.294
and from Canada, the Snowbirds.

04:47.354 --> 04:50.164
You can see the planes gathering
at the far end of the field.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.566
Once again this year,

04:51.625 --> 04:54.401
we have the most competitive
group of planes in our history,

04:54.461 --> 04:56.964
so the racing should be spectacular.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.010
They're moving for the taxiways.

04:59.065 --> 05:01.170
We'll be ready to start soon.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.043
Some of the competitors
are already airborne.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.777
There goes Jacobs in the #84 silver Mustang.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.880
And that's Harris in his P-51,
which he calls the Phantom.

05:11.778 --> 05:14.622
Would you look at that?

05:15.448 --> 05:18.725
You know, this show keeps
getting bigger every year.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.098
Don't you just love those old airplanes?

05:24.357 --> 05:26.428
You know, it is kind of fun to just

05:26.493 --> 05:29.167
to do some real old-time
cruising in a low-tech plane.

05:29.696 --> 05:32.199
Hey remember, I'm boot’n her back.

05:32.265 --> 05:35.838
I'm gonna show you the
old Santini snap roll.

05:35.902 --> 05:39.349
Yeah, I remember the last time you
did that, you lost your spaghetti.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.109
Oh, I'll give you a shot.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.329
Hey, look at that! Wow!

06:05.432 --> 06:08.345
Hey, hey! Isn't this great?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.540
Just like the county fair.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.550
I don't know. Looks a little crowded to me.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.053
Oh, come on, you know you love racing.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.680
Come on, the heats are ready
to start up. Let's go.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.383
All the planes are airborne now.

06:20.447 --> 06:23.257
Once they're warmed up, they'll
move into starting position.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.923
They're lining up now, Keep your eye
on the starter at the south pylon.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.160
And they're off!

06:29.222 --> 06:30.565
It's a good start.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.468
Jumping into the early lead
is Clemens in a P-38,

06:33.526 --> 06:35.233
then Rogers in an AT-6,

06:35.295 --> 06:37.741
Jacobs in a Mustang, Harper in a Sea Fury

06:37.797 --> 06:39.799
and Carver in a Mustang.

06:56.816 --> 07:00.491
That's Carver moving to 3rd, now
challenging Harper's Sea Fury.

07:00.553 --> 07:03.056
But Clemens still leads in his P-38.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.977
Now Carver's slipped into 2nd.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.380
That P-51 is really moving today.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.211
Jacobs has got his silver
Mustang right down to the deck,

07:22.275 --> 07:24.221
taking the low line around.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.915
Final lap, ladies and gentlemen.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.458
The checkered flag is waving!

07:27.514 --> 07:29.721
It's Clemens and Carver!
Clemens and Carver!

07:29.783 --> 07:32.457
Yes! Carver! Down under and home quick.

07:32.519 --> 07:36.331
It's Roan Carver in the P-51
Mustang to win the first heat.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.396
Did you see that move?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.565
Yeah. It's called skill.

07:42.629 --> 07:43.767
No kid’n.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.673
Come on, let's go check out
that Stappleford plane, eh?

07:48.068 --> 07:50.378
I'm sure you'd all like to meet the man

07:50.437 --> 07:53.281
whose company designed and built the X-400.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.910
The President of Stappleford
Industries, Lou Stappleford.

08:03.717 --> 08:06.891
For those of you who have not yet heard,

08:07.087 --> 08:10.432
the X-400 has just been certified

08:11.558 --> 08:15.563
as a low-level surveillance
and support aircraft.

08:15.996 --> 08:20.274
The Air Force has asked us
to start building 200 of them.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.246
This craft represents the highest level

08:25.305 --> 08:28.047
of aeronautical conception and design.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.620
It is built entirely of Prylon,

08:30.677 --> 08:33.851
a composite that enables it
not only to be bulletproof,

08:33.913 --> 08:37.053
but to have extreme stealth capabilities

08:37.116 --> 08:39.961
against any modern radar systems.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.763
Mr. Charles Crane here, our Chief Engineer,

08:43.823 --> 08:48.272
will answer any of your non-classified
questions as best he can.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.304
As for myself, I can only say

08:50.597 --> 08:54.010
that as the owner of Stappleford Aircraft,

08:54.300 --> 08:59.147
I am filled with pride that our
dream, this fantastic flying machine,

08:59.239 --> 09:02.743
will now become a regular part
of our national defense.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.111
Thank you.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.521
Hey, there's somebody's hand
over here I gotta shake.

09:08.581 --> 09:09.787
I'm sure we're all proud

09:09.849 --> 09:12.591
to have your new plane
as part of America's defense.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.429
I'd now like to introduce
you to the individual

09:15.488 --> 09:17.297
who led the design team for the X-400.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.927
Hello.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.467
Are you the one who was flying this baby?

09:22.529 --> 09:24.440
That's right, Mr…

09:24.497 --> 09:26.272
Oh, I'm Stringfellow Hawke.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.611
That's a mouthful.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.313
This is Dominic Santini.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.079
Hi! That was some kind of fly’n…

09:34.140 --> 09:35.551
Roan Carver.

09:35.608 --> 09:36.712
Thanks.

09:36.776 --> 09:39.256
This Mustang, do you own it?

09:39.946 --> 09:41.220
Me and the bank.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.488
Well, I gotta go. Nice talk’n to you.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.826
Miss Carver.

09:46.519 --> 09:47.657
It is Miss?

09:48.154 --> 09:49.224
Always.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.964
I just wanted to congratulate you again.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.532
I've gotta go check the race schedules.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.269
Maybe I'll see you later.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.514
That was a hell of a line, String.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.141
I used it myself back in 1941.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.778
Are there any questions?

10:09.843 --> 10:11.880
When will the production on the X-400 begin,

10:11.945 --> 10:14.619
and what kind of skills are you looking for?

10:14.681 --> 10:16.422
Well, we start in 3 weeks.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.895
And we're looking for
the usual aircraft skills.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.932
It's a very broad-based workforce.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.491
Anybody else?

10:22.555 --> 10:25.092
Yeah, I'd like to know about your plans…

10:25.358 --> 10:26.803
Hey, boss.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.272
Roan, I lost something last night,

10:29.329 --> 10:31.070
and I think maybe you found it.

10:35.668 --> 10:38.911
Lou, I really can't talk now.
I've got a lunch date.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.514
Come on, cheer up, will you?

10:45.578 --> 10:47.421
The lady said she may see us later.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.515
What are you talk’n about?

10:48.581 --> 10:52.358
Listen, hey, don't play games
with me. I'm not blind, you know.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.864
That lady pilot really tumbled your gyros.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.161
No big thing.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.224
Listen to him.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.565
Promise me something, will ya?

11:02.262 --> 11:05.471
That if I tell you that
the lady's com’n back,

11:05.598 --> 11:08.374
you won't turn around so fast that
you'll hurt yourself, will ya?

11:14.440 --> 11:15.919
Is she?

11:21.648 --> 11:24.060
Did you say you wanted to buy me lunch?

11:24.951 --> 11:27.488
I didn't, but I will.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.363
Stop begging. I'll go.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.430
Something wrong with your legs?

11:48.374 --> 11:51.446
Looks as if we're gonna
be playing some games.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.161
Get your cameras ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.197
Here come the Blue Angels again!

12:01.988 --> 12:03.331
How about that, folks?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.699
Let's hear it for the Blue Angels.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.938
So you run an air service?

12:09.162 --> 12:10.573
What do you do?

12:11.731 --> 12:16.111
Well, I work for a clandestine
government agency.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.878
I have a top-secret aircraft
that I keep in a cave.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.384
I live in a mountain cabin

12:21.441 --> 12:24.047
and I have a dog that
looks up girls' dresses.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.123
Unemployed, huh?

12:31.918 --> 12:32.953
What do you do?

12:33.019 --> 12:35.021
I'm a lady who lives out on a limb.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.360
Limbs.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.725
A limb can break under you, you know.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.793
And they have. Often.

12:41.060 --> 12:44.166
Momentarily, I'm one of Stappleford
Aircraft's test pilots.

12:44.230 --> 12:48.076
So Stappleford Aircraft picks up
the racing costs for your Mustang?

12:48.534 --> 12:50.514
My Mustang and also a Sea Fury.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.210
Well, if you're gonna have
a sponsor, have a heavyweight.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.913
You win very many races
with that sweet old war bird?

12:55.975 --> 12:57.010
A few.

12:57.076 --> 13:00.080
Of course, I figure I win every
time I pull those wheels up.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.688
The lady's a gypsy.

13:02.815 --> 13:03.919
It's true.

13:03.983 --> 13:06.657
But it's a tough act to keep
on the road these days.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.630
Gets tougher every year.

13:08.688 --> 13:12.135
Oh, the Mustang looks plenty quick
enough to stay ahead of most of ‘em.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.268
It is, and it does.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.572
May we have your attention, please?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.735
All race pilots still in the competition,

13:19.799 --> 13:21.073
please report to the Officials' Tent.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.580
That's me. Gotta go. Thanks for lunch.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.845
Say,

13:27.774 --> 13:29.378
you gonna be around later on?

13:29.909 --> 13:32.412
Listen for the sound of breaking limbs.

13:35.782 --> 13:39.229
You get a feel’n that lady
is walk’n a narrow line?

13:39.619 --> 13:41.360
You noticed that too, huh?

13:45.725 --> 13:47.398
You know what I'm think’n?

13:47.460 --> 13:48.495
What?

13:48.594 --> 13:51.097
I'm think’n that you're think’n

13:51.164 --> 13:54.202
that this place isn't so crowded anymore.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.575
You know, now that you mention it,

13:55.635 --> 13:57.911
it does look like it
thinned out a little bit.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.248
Roan, I think we better talk.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.757
I was rather surprised
to see you here today,

14:07.814 --> 14:09.452
but I guess you figured

14:09.982 --> 14:13.759
that I wouldn't notice the tapes were
missing until after this weekend.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.493
That was the general idea.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.729
So when I came early to the air
show, you grabbed the test data.

14:19.792 --> 14:23.262
But you see, my people checked
the company on Friday night.

14:23.329 --> 14:26.071
So Roan, I'll take those tapes, please.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.405
I can't, Lou.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.447
Not until you agree to my terms.

14:29.502 --> 14:32.108
You don't have the experience
to know what happened.

14:32.171 --> 14:34.151
You don't have the expertise.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.086
Come off it, Lou! I'm a damn good
test pilot, and you know it.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.247
Yes, I know that.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.917
I'm the one that gave you the
chance to prove it, remember?

14:40.980 --> 14:43.893
No one else would hire a lady jet jockey.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.459
No, you're the only one in the business,

14:46.519 --> 14:48.521
and I'm the one that got you there.

14:49.255 --> 14:52.566
I know that, and I'm grateful.
I've always been grateful.

14:53.359 --> 14:56.306
Then why don't you show
it? Oh, my God, Roan.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.803
We have worked years to get where we are.

14:58.865 --> 15:02.540
This contract is the entire
future of Stappleford Aircraft.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.441
And the jobs of 1,500 people

15:05.505 --> 15:08.076
you're putting that in
jeopardy, don't you see that?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.979
Don't you think I know that?

15:11.043 --> 15:13.489
I haven't thought about
anything else for days.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.992
Ask me to do anything else
for you Lou, and I would.

15:16.048 --> 15:17.550
But I can't do this.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.598
And you can't either. You've got
to do what's right and fix it.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.428
Otherwise, I'll have to.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.000
It's your move.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.198
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

15:28.261 --> 15:31.572
overhead is Lieutenant Commander
Ellis of the Blue Angels.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.144
How's that for low-level aerobatics?

15:43.776 --> 15:46.382
Doesn't she understand? We'll all be ruined!

15:46.446 --> 15:48.551
Of course she understands.

15:48.614 --> 15:52.585
But all of a sudden she's on a
crusade, Joan of Arc in a jumpsuit.

15:52.718 --> 15:55.289
If we could just ship enough
planes to break even,

15:55.354 --> 15:58.062
then we could find this
problem and report it.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.198
Why don't I talk to her?

16:00.326 --> 16:02.203
I can convince her the
chance of in-flight failure

16:02.261 --> 16:03.797
is virtually zero.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.439
We've tried everything else.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.476
Go get her, will you?

16:10.837 --> 16:13.044
The planes for heat 2
of the Unlimited class

16:13.105 --> 16:15.381
are ready to race. And they're off!

16:15.775 --> 16:17.948
Jumping out are Lasky in an AT-G

16:18.010 --> 16:20.388
and Cole in the Stappleford Sea Fury.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.823
Lasky still leads, but Cole's got
that Sea Fury wound up tight.

16:31.424 --> 16:34.496
Look at Cole, right down to the
deck as he goes to the lead!

16:34.560 --> 16:36.904
Stappleford Aircraft looks
tough to beat today.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.656
Hey, lady.

16:55.214 --> 16:58.058
Mr. Stappleford's getting
a little impatient with you.

17:34.587 --> 17:35.861
You okay?

17:35.922 --> 17:37.731
That wasn't necessary.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.071
Hey!

17:44.897 --> 17:46.706
I can take care of myself.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.643
Didn't look like that to me.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.742
I'm not your concern.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.373
Yeah? Well, don't take it so personal, lady.

17:52.438 --> 17:53.883
I'd have done the same
thing for anybody else.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.010
I'm not just anybody!

17:55.074 --> 17:57.645
Hey, how about it, lady? 3 darts for $1.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.849
Try your luck, huh? How about you, mister?

18:00.313 --> 18:01.485
Thank you.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.192
All right.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.785
You know, you may be one hell of a pilot,

18:05.851 --> 18:08.024
but you're sure lacking in social graces.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.395
I know that.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.495
You do?

18:13.559 --> 18:16.335
Yes, I do. I'm sorry, so forgive me, okay?

18:20.533 --> 18:23.742
It's Cole the winner in
the Stappleford Sea Fury.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.755
You know, you didn't
finish your lunch today.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.427
Maybe you'd like to have
an early dinner, huh?

18:41.187 --> 18:42.689
One condition.

18:44.824 --> 18:45.996
What's that?

18:46.325 --> 18:48.737
No questions about those 2 guys back there.

18:51.197 --> 18:52.335
What guys?

19:25.765 --> 19:29.144
You mak’n any progress with our problem?

19:29.201 --> 19:31.772
She's always been stubborn.
We just can't reason with her.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.681
Listen, I'm the official
test pilot of record.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.443
If she compromises me,
it could cost me dearly.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.148
It could cost us all.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.425
I win again.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.764
Now, wait a minute.

19:55.394 --> 19:56.873
Now who wins, huh?

19:58.330 --> 20:00.708
I think you switched monkeys on me.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.514
Hawke, will you answer one
question for me, honestly?

20:05.571 --> 20:06.606
Sure.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.582
Who are you, really?

20:10.142 --> 20:11.382
Well, I told you.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.756
I know. You fly some secret
weapon that you keep in a cave

20:14.847 --> 20:16.758
and you work for some secret agency

20:16.816 --> 20:18.853
and you live with a dog on a mountain.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.193
Level with me.

20:21.587 --> 20:24.431
I told you. What I said was all the truth.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.605
You almost make me believe that.

20:29.361 --> 20:30.840
Well, believe it.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.538
Why did you lie to me before?

20:33.599 --> 20:35.442
I haven't lied.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.412
Everything I said was the truth.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.507
But you made it sound like a lie.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.176
Well, yeah.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.080
I can't really talk about it.

20:45.644 --> 20:46.816
What about you?

20:46.879 --> 20:49.189
What did you do before you
went to work for Stappleford?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.819
I don't like to talk about what's behind me.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.696
I don't either, unless
there's a good reason.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.133
Is there?

20:58.190 --> 20:59.635
What do you think?

21:01.894 --> 21:06.206
Well, I grew up next to a
small airport in the Midwest,

21:06.265 --> 21:09.178
hung around and got my
first plane ride at 8.

21:09.969 --> 21:13.473
From then on, I knew exactly what
I wanted to do with my life.

21:13.539 --> 21:16.110
I always hated feeling closed in,

21:16.175 --> 21:18.451
and up there I felt so free.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.455
So right.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.524
Let me guess.

21:22.581 --> 21:24.618
You soloed at 16.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.757
Then worked my way up from there.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.630
Multi-engines, jets.

21:31.357 --> 21:34.895
I was working for an executive jet
charter when I met Mr. Stappleford.

21:34.994 --> 21:38.066
He liked the way I handled
a little emergency we had,

21:38.130 --> 21:40.667
so I asked for a test pilot tryout.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.838
And the rest was aviation history?

21:47.873 --> 21:50.080
Are you planning on leaving Mr. Stappleford?

21:51.143 --> 21:54.590
Could be. I'm beginning to
feel a little crowded there.

21:54.780 --> 21:57.260
I guess he wouldn't be
very happy about that, huh?

21:57.850 --> 21:59.523
How do you figure that?

22:01.887 --> 22:04.026
Well, those 2 guys who were hassling you,

22:04.089 --> 22:05.864
they had Stappleford's logo.

22:07.092 --> 22:08.196
What 2 guys?

22:11.964 --> 22:13.307
Yeah. Right.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.614
Well, Mr. Stringfellow Hawke,

22:26.679 --> 22:29.285
I can see you didn't learn all
your moves in the cockpit.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.918
You keep talking like that,

22:30.983 --> 22:33.486
then you're gonna be a 4-point rollover.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.025
There you go get’n gushy on me.

22:37.890 --> 22:38.925
Gushy?

22:53.572 --> 22:55.415
6 is my lucky number.

22:57.409 --> 22:59.218
Let's just hope it's mine.

23:06.952 --> 23:09.091
One hell of a housekeeper.

23:15.427 --> 23:16.531
Where is it?

23:29.341 --> 23:31.548
Your friends from Stappleford do this?

23:31.877 --> 23:32.878
Probably.

23:33.379 --> 23:34.483
Why?

23:39.551 --> 23:41.462
They were looking for these.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.494
What are they?

23:44.857 --> 23:48.896
The cockpit computer tapes from the
test flight of Stappleford's X-400.

23:51.363 --> 23:52.364
Why do you have them?

23:52.431 --> 23:55.571
I lifted them from Stappleford's
flight center night before last.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.180
You lifted them?

23:57.736 --> 23:59.010
Or you stole them?

23:59.138 --> 24:00.811
Depends on how you look at it.

24:00.873 --> 24:04.582
Cole was the test pilot of record,
but I flew the X-400 first.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.121
So what do they mean?

24:07.947 --> 24:11.224
They mean that the Air Force is
about to spend a billion dollars

24:11.283 --> 24:13.285
on 200 copies of the X-400

24:13.352 --> 24:16.265
and any or all of them could
suffer an in-flight failure.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.200
That's pretty scary.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.968
I really can't believe this.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.178
One thing's for sure.

24:34.506 --> 24:36.486
I'm not leaving you here tonight.

24:37.409 --> 24:38.649
Stay with me.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.288
The forceful type, huh?

24:50.889 --> 24:51.890
Well?

24:53.659 --> 24:57.129
Haver and Morgan tore her room
apart. They came up empty.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.808
I'm not surprised.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.871
What did they expect?

25:01.100 --> 25:04.047
She's too smart to leave that
flight data just lying around.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.877
They wrote a threat on her mirror.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.577
Figured it would scare her.

25:10.609 --> 25:12.145
They are idiots.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.457
This woman power-dives
experimental aircraft

25:15.514 --> 25:17.289
at over 1,500 miles an hour.

25:18.584 --> 25:21.394
It's going to take a lot more
than that to frighten her.

25:22.388 --> 25:23.389
A lot more.

25:24.757 --> 25:28.705
So what do you suggest?

25:31.296 --> 25:34.766
I suggest we all get ready
for a very hard fall.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.913
No way.

25:37.069 --> 25:41.916
Look, Lou Stappleford is not
gonna let some hysterical female

25:41.974 --> 25:43.510
bring his whole operation down.

25:43.575 --> 25:46.112
He can play hardball if he has to.

25:46.245 --> 25:49.783
Yeah, maybe so, but it looks to me
like he's running outta options.

25:50.783 --> 25:53.320
He can't scare her off.
He can't buy her off.

25:54.620 --> 25:57.499
So what's he gonna do, Cole? Huh?

26:23.382 --> 26:26.090
This morning, Dom and I are gonna
take you to meet General Hillman.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.791
He'll put you together with all
the right Pentagon people.

26:28.854 --> 26:30.856
I'm racing in the finals today.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.100
Well, that doesn't seem just all
that important right now, does it?

26:34.159 --> 26:36.730
Well, it is to me. I've got a
payment due on the Mustang.

26:36.795 --> 26:39.298
Stappleford threatened you last night.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.276
I think it's about time
you vacated the area.

26:42.334 --> 26:43.813
Lou wouldn't hurt me,

26:43.869 --> 26:46.281
not while I've got the
X-400 test flight data.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.614
Besides, last night was his last hurrah.

26:48.707 --> 26:50.618
You don't really believe that, do you?

26:50.709 --> 26:52.086
Sure, I do.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.584
Listen Hawke, Lou Stappleford
is a businessman.

26:55.647 --> 26:58.025
He's not a thug, not a spy.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.360
Sure, he'll threaten me and
have his men trash my room,

27:01.453 --> 27:04.297
but when it comes right down
to it, he's not gonna hurt me.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.930
Listen to me. You can't be sure of that.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.633
That guy's got a billion reasons

27:13.699 --> 27:15.542
why he'd want you out of the way.

27:15.701 --> 27:18.545
I'm not gonna stand by Roan,
and watch you get hurt.

27:18.670 --> 27:20.149
Suddenly it gets personal?

27:20.539 --> 27:23.850
Yeah, suddenly it does.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.786
I told you, I don't like being crowded.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.188
You know, you can't always be alone.

27:32.484 --> 27:36.626
And if you try it, you're gonna
crowd yourself right into a corner.

27:37.856 --> 27:38.857
I know.

27:40.859 --> 27:42.600
I know because I tried it.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.632
I wanna race.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.311
I need to.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.336
Please?

27:51.603 --> 27:54.516
Then I'll act like a big girl, okay?

27:58.877 --> 28:01.221
Only if I can arrange the proper protection.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.428
I don't know all the details yet, Michael,

28:06.485 --> 28:10.433
but she says that the X-400 is
seriously flawed and I believe her.

28:11.256 --> 28:14.203
A billion dollars' worth
of substandard aircraft?

28:14.259 --> 28:16.739
The newspapers could have a
field day with that one.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.099
I know you think Miss Carver's credible,

28:19.164 --> 28:21.770
but can she supply any documentation, proof?

28:21.867 --> 28:24.541
She's got the cockpit computer
tapes from her test flights.

28:24.603 --> 28:27.015
Excellent. I'll call the Pentagon.

28:27.072 --> 28:30.383
Make sure you have access to General
Hillman as soon as possible.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.752
Yeah, listen, we should
be there this afternoon.

28:32.811 --> 28:35.121
Fine. Anything else you need?

28:35.514 --> 28:37.050
No, I think that's it. Thanks, Michael.

28:37.115 --> 28:38.355
You're welcome.

28:38.584 --> 28:41.758
Take good care of Miss Carver
and those tapes.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.297
Right. I'll see you.

28:47.125 --> 28:50.334
If it's got any design flaws,
you can't tell by looking.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.739
When operating at max speed and firepower,

28:52.798 --> 28:56.007
there's a tendency to set up
structural shock wave harmonics.

28:56.134 --> 28:59.707
The vibration is deadly and it
can cause aileron reversal.

29:00.472 --> 29:05.012
Even commercial jets experience
momentary aileron reversal.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.885
Yeah, but this isn't momentary.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.491
And it's self-accelerating, severe,

29:09.581 --> 29:11.424
and it can happen at any altitude.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.358
Look, I've got a pilots' meeting.

29:15.988 --> 29:16.989
Be sharp.

29:20.726 --> 29:24.435
You know String, you gotta
remember, she's not an Engineer,

29:25.163 --> 29:29.805
and the X-400 did pass the Air
Force Flight Certification Test.

29:29.868 --> 29:32.849
Yeah, but she pushed it beyond
the Air Force requirements.

29:33.105 --> 29:37.110
Oh, we all know that every
aircraft has its limitations.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.653
Yeah, she knows that.

29:38.710 --> 29:41.247
Every airplane has its margin for error

29:41.313 --> 29:44.123
between its legal limitation
and its actual fail point.

29:44.883 --> 29:47.489
She's just saying that the
margin is too narrow.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.733
Oh, you're talking about
a very gray area, String.

29:51.456 --> 29:55.233
Well, if she's wrong, why is
Stappleford so worried about it?

29:57.929 --> 29:59.101
You got a point.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.604
Yeah, I'm gonna stay with her
until this race is over, but

30:06.071 --> 30:07.072
maybe…

30:11.710 --> 30:14.884
You mean, bring the Lady here?

30:16.815 --> 30:17.816
I'm with you.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.451
I'm on my way.

30:20.519 --> 30:21.896
Keep out of trouble.

30:26.892 --> 30:31.671
I want you to arrange, for her,
an accident in the finals.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.403
A fatal accident.

30:35.567 --> 30:39.310
Listen, a man could get hurt
trying something like that.

30:39.371 --> 30:40.873
Oh, I'm aware of the risks.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.809
No, I don't think you are.

30:44.142 --> 30:45.712
Now, I'm not too fond of the girl,

30:45.777 --> 30:48.053
but I'm not crazy about
the idea of kill’n her,

30:48.146 --> 30:50.126
especially in front of a crowd.

30:50.282 --> 30:53.820
Make it look like an accident. They
happen all the time at air races.

30:53.885 --> 30:57.423
Yeah. Yeah, they do, but I'm not
gonna be one of the victims.

30:57.723 --> 31:00.670
You are one of the victims.
Don't you see that? We all are.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.561
Now look,

31:04.129 --> 31:07.303
either you take her down
or she takes us down.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.377
And I'm not just talking financial here.

31:09.434 --> 31:12.074
The Air Force could file criminal charges.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.811
You did remind me you
are the pilot of record.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.181
Are you saying that we could do prison time?

31:17.242 --> 31:19.313
That's exactly what I'm saying.

31:19.478 --> 31:22.516
We're getting carried away
fellas, okay? We're overreacting.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.321
I don't believe the X-400 is going to fail.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.920
And I ought to know, I designed it.

31:26.985 --> 31:29.226
But you didn't fly it. No, she did.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.835
As long as she is alive,

31:31.890 --> 31:34.302
if the Air Force finds any fault whatsoever,

31:34.359 --> 31:35.360
we are exposed.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.601
She could turn a minor doubt
into a major catastrophe.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.701
What you're saying is, I don't
really have much choice.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.781
None of us has a choice.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.279
Now a special treat, folks.

31:47.339 --> 31:50.980
The incredible Eagles Acrobatic
Flight Team in their Christen Eagles.

33:45.557 --> 33:48.197
I'm gonna win. Why aren't you smiling?

33:48.260 --> 33:50.536
I'll smile when you get out of this thing.

33:50.896 --> 33:53.604
As soon as I win this,

33:53.665 --> 33:56.373
the 3 of us are leaving with you.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.637
Before you pick up your trophy?

33:58.703 --> 34:00.705
Hey, winning it is my trophy.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.619
Now the moment we've all been waiting for,

34:44.683 --> 34:47.322
the Unlimited class finals.

34:47.819 --> 34:51.027
The planes are getting airborne,
so be ready for action.

34:57.228 --> 34:58.764
They're lined up for the start,

34:58.830 --> 35:00.309
and they're off!

35:03.535 --> 35:05.572
Early going, it's Kruger in his AT-G,

35:05.637 --> 35:08.140
followed closely by Carver
in her blue Mustang.

35:08.206 --> 35:11.244
Then it's Cole in the Stappleford Sea Fury.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.858
Now Cole is closing in on Carver,

35:26.891 --> 35:28.768
coming up on her outside.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.580
Look at those 2 as they battle!

35:40.639 --> 35:41.947
That's what I call racing!

35:42.007 --> 35:43.645
Now Cole's trying the inside.

35:43.708 --> 35:46.086
Cole and Carver. They're wing-to-wing.

36:21.546 --> 36:23.389
Cole and Carver slap wings,

36:23.448 --> 36:25.052
and Carver's got trouble.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.296
Looks like a broken line.

36:33.925 --> 36:37.702
Incredible, folks! Carver's Mustang
is smoke’n and lose’n oil,

36:37.762 --> 36:40.174
but she's try’n to hang in the race.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.070
Looks like Carver's plane is faltering.

36:56.715 --> 37:00.595
And she's leave’n the course
and give’n up the race.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.271
Don't worry viewers, she's a real pro.

37:11.329 --> 37:13.536
She'll get that plane on the ground somehow.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.043
Roan, this is Hawke, do you read?

37:17.335 --> 37:18.712
Roan, do you read?

37:18.770 --> 37:20.807
I read. Where are you?

37:20.939 --> 37:21.940
On your right.

37:22.006 --> 37:23.349
I can't see.

37:23.441 --> 37:25.114
I know, there's an oil leak.

37:36.521 --> 37:40.833
Cole's blown it. If Roan gets down
alive, she'll spill her guts.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.030
I'm go’n after her.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.936
Lou, for the love of God,

37:44.195 --> 37:46.436
covering a killing with an
accident was bad enough.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.535
Using the X-400, that's insanity.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.080
Charlie, we've made our
move. We are committed.

37:51.136 --> 37:53.241
I'm not gonna let her ruin us.

37:53.304 --> 37:55.477
Now, come on, help me
get this thing cranked up.

38:32.243 --> 38:33.779
Roan, you got mountains ahead.

38:34.546 --> 38:37.857
I still can't see. I'm losing altitude.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.393
Raise the nose more.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.294
I'm trying, Hawke. It's not working.

38:45.223 --> 38:48.170
Roan, just keep it in
the air. You can do it.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.828
I'm trying, Hawke.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.473
You're clear, Roan.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.532
Listen, Roan, we gotta
get you on the ground.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.772
There's a mesa ahead.
That’ll be your best shot.

39:01.239 --> 39:02.445
Lower the nose.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.175
Full flaps.

39:11.749 --> 39:13.592
Start easing off the power now.

39:23.394 --> 39:26.000
It's okay. I want you as slow as possible.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.610
You're about 40 feet.

39:32.270 --> 39:33.408
30 feet.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.585
Lift your left wing.

39:40.445 --> 39:42.982
I'll tell you when to chop and flare.

39:47.151 --> 39:48.152
Chop it.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.087
We gotta get out of here.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.096
No! I'm not gonna let this plane burn!

41:02.860 --> 41:03.998
Go on without me.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.063
You're crazy!

41:25.283 --> 41:26.819
He's making another pass.

41:26.918 --> 41:28.158
The hell he is.

41:38.062 --> 41:40.406
We gotta decoy him. Is he following us?

41:40.498 --> 41:42.569
Following? He's running over us!

41:54.078 --> 41:56.922
Friend, you picked the
wrong plane to mess with.

42:00.918 --> 42:02.329
Combat mode, Dom.

42:02.420 --> 42:03.797
Combat mode.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.128
Reach full turbo.

42:08.192 --> 42:09.193
Full turbo.

42:19.971 --> 42:22.508
Missile fired. Dropping sunburst.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.501
I need more, Dom.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.902
Forget it. We're 30%
past maneuvering speed now.

42:50.401 --> 42:52.074
He's still all over us.

42:52.136 --> 42:53.809
Let's run him through the maze.

43:23.201 --> 43:25.807
Dom, around the next turn,
I want full reverse turbo.

43:25.870 --> 43:27.645
String, you slam on the brakes,

43:27.705 --> 43:29.548
I'm not sure she'll hold together.

43:29.607 --> 43:30.915
She's gonna have to.

43:36.647 --> 43:37.648
Now!

43:54.699 --> 43:55.905
Nice shot, String!

43:56.367 --> 43:58.210
Well, so much for the X-400.

43:58.269 --> 43:59.976
Let's get back to Roan.

44:33.638 --> 44:34.639
Sorry, Roan.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.615
The fire got to the fuel tank.

44:37.675 --> 44:39.677
I tried. I couldn't stop it.

44:39.777 --> 44:40.778
I know.

44:40.845 --> 44:43.382
I'm gonna do… I'm gonna do
a quick ground check,

44:43.447 --> 44:46.053
make sure she didn't sprain
anything important.

44:53.391 --> 44:57.032
When I was little, we had a pair of
eagles that nested on our property.

44:58.429 --> 45:00.431
And I'd watch them early in the morning,

45:00.498 --> 45:03.240
and they'd soar together way up in the sky.

45:04.835 --> 45:07.145
I always wished I could
be up there with ‘em.

45:08.206 --> 45:09.879
With her, I could.

45:10.074 --> 45:13.612
Well, you know Roan, there's other eagles.

45:15.413 --> 45:18.792
No, I think we only get one.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.495
After that we call ‘em airplanes.

45:24.989 --> 45:28.266
Hawke, Dom and I can take care
of the Stappleford thing.

45:30.127 --> 45:32.539
Then I think I'd like to
hide out for a while.

45:33.431 --> 45:34.808
Will you contact me?

45:36.867 --> 45:38.813
Yeah, I'll just look for
that mountain hideaway

45:38.869 --> 45:41.577
that a super-spy and his dog might live in.

45:43.341 --> 45:46.220
Hey, I was just kind of blow’n
smoke about that spy stuff.

45:46.477 --> 45:50.254
Yeah, just like you were about that
classified helicopter you fly.
