WEBVTT

00:01.780 --> 00:03.046
You killed the deputy secretary.

00:03.048 --> 00:05.915
<i> Graydal is not just</i>
<i>your everyday security firm.</i>

00:05.917 --> 00:08.284
<i>They're like Blackwater</i>
<i>on steroids.</i>

00:08.286 --> 00:09.818
<i> Come on, Braxton.</i>
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

00:09.821 --> 00:11.320
What does he want from me?

00:11.322 --> 00:13.523
Well, it isn't what <i> I</i> want,
Keller.

00:13.525 --> 00:15.358
It's what the buyer wants.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.593
Please don't tell me
there's another beast out there.

00:17.595 --> 00:19.262
<i> Are you sure</i>
<i>that this is Braxton?</i>

00:19.264 --> 00:21.197
DNA and dental records match.

00:21.199 --> 00:23.466
Seems we have
another beast on our hands.

00:23.468 --> 00:24.667
Word came down from the top.

00:24.669 --> 00:27.170
DHS will never make
a deal with Vincent.

00:27.172 --> 00:29.138
The fight's over.
We lost.

00:29.140 --> 00:31.207
Here. It's your new life.

00:31.209 --> 00:33.576
Hi. I'm Agent
Olivia Dylan.

00:33.578 --> 00:35.578
I turned the names over to DHS.

00:35.580 --> 00:37.580
Kyle, you have no idea
what you've done!

00:37.582 --> 00:38.781
Go!

00:40.485 --> 00:42.051
You're under arrest.

00:46.958 --> 00:49.358
You said you had $4,000
in the bank.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.061
I said I had <i> about</i> $4,000,
okay? I rounded up.

00:52.063 --> 00:54.931
$2,300 does not
round up to $4,000.

00:54.933 --> 00:56.766
Well, news flash:
I'm bad with math.

00:56.768 --> 00:59.168
And with money.
Yeah, but without more money,

00:59.170 --> 01:01.537
we're not gonna be able
to afford a lawyer for Cat.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.139
Please tell me you know her password.
“VincatForEver”.

01:03.141 --> 01:05.575
Capital V, F, E, no spaces.

01:05.577 --> 01:07.443
Forever, huh?
At this rate, we'll be lucky

01:07.445 --> 01:09.011
to get them one more day.
Okay, whatever.

01:09.013 --> 01:11.814
We just have to get Cat
out of there, okay?

01:11.816 --> 01:14.484
Can't have her spending another
night in prison 'cause of me.

01:14.486 --> 01:15.752
Well, it'd be
a hell of a lot easier

01:15.754 --> 01:17.353
if I hadn't sold my computers.

01:17.355 --> 01:19.689
Doesn't Cat ever defrag
this damn thing?

01:19.691 --> 01:22.792
I don't know even know
what that means.

01:22.794 --> 01:24.694
It means I can't get
the auction site to load

01:24.696 --> 01:27.196
so I could transfer the retainer
over to the lawyer.

01:27.198 --> 01:29.031
Finally.
Okay, well, just out of curiosity,

01:29.033 --> 01:30.433
if it's already
costing us

01:30.435 --> 01:32.635
this much just to get
Cat out of jail,

01:32.637 --> 01:35.138
how are we gonna pay
for the trial fees?

01:35.140 --> 01:37.039
Trial?
There's not gonna be a trial.

01:37.041 --> 01:39.842
But Vincent's innocent-- how
else is he gonna defend himself?

01:39.844 --> 01:41.277
He's not.

01:41.279 --> 01:42.578
Heather, wake up.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.413
We're way past
trying to exonerate him.

01:44.415 --> 01:45.548
Cat and Vincent need to bail.

01:45.550 --> 01:46.616
They got to get

01:46.618 --> 01:47.917
the hell out of here, forever.

01:47.919 --> 01:49.218
<i>If</i> we could ever
find out

01:49.220 --> 01:50.686
where they're holding
Vincent, that is.

01:50.688 --> 01:52.755
And what if we can't?

01:54.893 --> 01:57.794
Let's just try
and get Cat out first.

01:57.796 --> 01:59.996
Then we'll worry
about Vincent.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074

02:14.379 --> 02:16.212
Sorry to see you
in there, Chandler.

02:16.214 --> 02:19.182
Yeah, well, you're the one
who put me in here.

02:19.184 --> 02:21.250
I gave you every opportunity to
get on the right side of this.

02:21.252 --> 02:23.820
You could've been the one
to bring your husband in.

02:23.822 --> 02:27.156
Instead, you... you flushed
your career down the toilet.

02:27.158 --> 02:28.791
Nice talking to you.

02:28.793 --> 02:29.926
Open up.

02:32.430 --> 02:34.931
Not just your career either.
I mean, right now

02:34.933 --> 02:36.966
it's aiding and abetting,
but if you don't tell us

02:36.968 --> 02:38.067
Vincent's next move,

02:38.069 --> 02:39.602
it'll be
conspiracy, too.

02:39.604 --> 02:41.204
What next move?

02:41.206 --> 02:42.805
You caught him.

02:42.807 --> 02:45.074
We can't prove that
he killed Hill in self-defense,

02:45.076 --> 02:46.776
so it's over.

02:46.778 --> 02:48.845
Yeah, well, this is now more
than just about Secretary Hill.

02:48.847 --> 02:51.247
This is about the other
people that Vincent killed,

02:51.249 --> 02:52.548
and more importantly,

02:52.550 --> 02:54.517
who he's <i> about</i> to kill.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.588
What are you talking about?

02:58.590 --> 03:01.057
Peter Braxton,
Lars Ecklund, Albert Garrus.

03:01.059 --> 03:03.426
You know who they
were, right?

03:03.428 --> 03:05.862
Yeah.

03:05.864 --> 03:07.029
And you know that
he killed them, too.

03:07.031 --> 03:08.598
Vincent did not kill them.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.233
Well, we have reason
to believe that he did.

03:10.235 --> 03:12.201
Now we have reason to believe
that he's not done,

03:12.203 --> 03:13.603
that he's planning on
an even bigger target.

03:13.605 --> 03:15.771
Come on, from jail?
Well, the pieces of his plan

03:15.773 --> 03:18.107
are obviously in motion, or else
he wouldn't have been getting

03:18.109 --> 03:20.276
on a plane to try to
escape, now would he?

03:20.278 --> 03:21.878
I don't know anything
about another target,

03:21.880 --> 03:22.879
and neither does Vincent.

03:22.881 --> 03:24.947
Cat, listen to me.

03:24.949 --> 03:27.683
Don't let him pull you down
any more than he already has.

03:27.685 --> 03:30.286
I am telling you,
there is no plan.

03:30.288 --> 03:32.455
And if somebody else is
telling you that there is one,

03:32.457 --> 03:34.023
they are lying,
they are setting him up.

03:34.025 --> 03:35.558
I don't understand why
you keep protecting him.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.027
Yes, he's your husband,
but people are going to die

03:38.029 --> 03:39.629
if you don't
help us stop him.

03:39.631 --> 03:41.364
Innocent people--
the kind of people

03:41.366 --> 03:43.499
you were supposed to be
sworn to protect.

03:43.501 --> 03:45.568
How can you
just let that happen?

03:45.570 --> 03:47.904
I do not know
what you are talking about.

03:47.906 --> 03:49.472
I'm talking about
domestic terrorism.

03:49.474 --> 03:50.806
I'm talking about
the Patriot Act.

03:50.808 --> 03:52.008
I am talking about

03:52.010 --> 03:54.911
life in prison without
the possibility of parole.

03:54.913 --> 03:57.280
Do you understand?

03:58.950 --> 04:03.019
Looks like you got friends in
high places there, Chandler.

04:03.021 --> 04:04.253
What is going on?
She lawyered up.

04:04.255 --> 04:05.421
He got her out.

04:08.259 --> 04:10.092
Look, I don't know
what the hell's going on here,

04:10.094 --> 04:11.961
Agent Dylan,
but I'm gonna figure it out,

04:11.963 --> 04:15.431
because despite what you think,
I'm not the bad guy here.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.433
And neither is my husband.

04:20.204 --> 04:22.204
I am so sorry

04:22.206 --> 04:23.706
about what
Kyle did, Cat.

04:23.708 --> 04:25.641
Where's Vincent?
Has anyone spoken to him?

04:25.643 --> 04:27.877
No. Nobody knows where
he is, not even Tess.

04:27.879 --> 04:29.545
Well, let me guess--
he's not on

04:29.547 --> 04:31.614
the inmate locator either, is he?
No. How'd you know?

04:31.616 --> 04:33.616
'Cause DHS is treating him
like a terrorist,

04:33.618 --> 04:35.551
not like a murder suspect.

04:35.553 --> 04:37.186
What? Why?

04:37.188 --> 04:40.122
I don't know. That's what
I have to figure out.

04:40.124 --> 04:41.557
Somehow they're trying
to connect Vincent to Braxton

04:41.559 --> 04:43.526
and the rest
of the cabal's murders.

04:43.528 --> 04:46.162
They think Vincent killed them,
not Braxton's beast.

04:46.164 --> 04:48.331
Wait, so does this mean
that DHS knows about beasts?

04:48.333 --> 04:50.833
Do you think they saw
Braxton's tape showing Vincent?

04:51.703 --> 04:53.536
No, not yet.
But if they knew,

04:53.538 --> 04:55.471
Dylan would have been asking
very different questions.

04:55.473 --> 04:57.940
As it is, they're trying
to hang it all on Vincent,

04:57.942 --> 04:59.542
including something
that hasn't even happened yet.

04:59.544 --> 05:02.244
Somebody's got to be
behind this, but who?

05:02.246 --> 05:04.947
Yeah. Um, look, about Kyle.

05:04.949 --> 05:06.949
I just... Okay, obviously...

05:06.951 --> 05:08.651
Well, he's a jerk--

05:08.653 --> 05:12.121
my jerk--
so I'm really, really sorry.

05:12.123 --> 05:14.056
We can talk about this later.

05:14.058 --> 05:16.225
Do you mind taking a cab?
I've got to go straight to Tess,

05:16.227 --> 05:18.060
figure out what she knows.
Yeah, of course. Anything.

05:18.062 --> 05:19.895
Great. Thank you. Keys?

05:22.133 --> 05:24.367
Sorry.

05:28.039 --> 05:30.339
You got her out?
That must have been some price

05:30.341 --> 05:31.741
getting her
out of DHS detention.

05:31.743 --> 05:32.942
Where'd you get the money?

05:32.944 --> 05:34.977
Well, you know,
Heather helped, too.

05:34.979 --> 05:37.413
Plus, I borrowed against
what's left of my pension,

05:37.415 --> 05:38.981
sold my computers,

05:38.983 --> 05:40.016
got rid of everything.

05:40.018 --> 05:41.417
You sold your computers?

05:41.419 --> 05:43.519
That's why I'm at Il Cantuccio
on Cat's laptop.

05:43.521 --> 05:44.687
Wi-Fi is better here.

05:44.689 --> 05:45.888
Oh, JT.

05:45.890 --> 05:47.423
Come on,
what was I supposed to do?

05:47.425 --> 05:50.626
If we can't get to Cat,
no way we can get Vincent.

05:50.628 --> 05:52.461
What?

05:52.463 --> 05:56.866
If I told you I loved you,
would you take it the wrong way?

05:56.868 --> 05:59.301
Probably.

06:02.874 --> 06:05.141
So...

06:05.143 --> 06:07.043
any idea where DHS took Vincent?

06:07.045 --> 06:08.110
I can't find him anywhere.

06:08.112 --> 06:09.145
No, I have no idea,

06:09.147 --> 06:10.613
and that's what scares me.

06:10.615 --> 06:12.415
He should be in a federal pen

06:12.417 --> 06:14.850
or DHS detention,
but it's like he's just gone.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.452
So where the hell is he?

06:16.454 --> 06:17.620
I don't...

06:17.622 --> 06:20.322
Cat's here. I'll
call you back.

06:20.324 --> 06:24.126
Just work on those new aliases
for when we do find him. Hi.

06:25.730 --> 06:27.029
You okay?

06:27.031 --> 06:28.898
I don't know.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.199
Go on. Sit, sit, sit.

06:30.201 --> 06:33.202
Honestly, it feels like
it's all falling apart,

06:33.204 --> 06:35.304
everything.
It's okay. It's all right.

06:35.306 --> 06:36.472
We're gonna
figure this out, Cat.

06:36.474 --> 06:37.873
All right?
I promise.

06:38.543 --> 06:40.409
Here.

06:40.411 --> 06:41.677
I don't know

06:41.679 --> 06:43.679
what I was thinking--
it was only a matter time

06:43.681 --> 06:44.947
before we both got caught.

06:44.949 --> 06:46.382
You were thinking
what you always think:

06:46.384 --> 06:48.484
that, you know,
you could pull it off.

06:48.486 --> 06:50.019
David versus Goliath.

06:50.021 --> 06:52.655
Isn't David supposed to win?

06:52.657 --> 06:53.689
Yeah.

06:53.691 --> 06:55.491
We should've gotten
on that plane.

06:55.493 --> 06:57.059
We shouldn't have hesitated.

06:57.061 --> 06:58.227
Why did you?

06:58.229 --> 07:00.262
It didn't feel right--
not with another beast

07:00.264 --> 07:01.997
out there killing people.

07:01.999 --> 07:04.600
Or killing the people who turned
him into a beast, but I get it.

07:04.602 --> 07:06.702
Except DHS thinks that Vincent

07:06.704 --> 07:08.704
is the one killing them.
I know.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.410
That wasn't the only reason
we hesitated.

07:14.412 --> 07:15.811
I don't know, Tess.

07:15.813 --> 07:17.379
I keep... thinking about

07:17.381 --> 07:19.949
all of the things that Vincent
and I have been through,

07:19.951 --> 07:22.084
all the crazy stuff
that we've done.

07:22.086 --> 07:25.254
We keep putting ourselves
in impossible situations, and...

07:25.256 --> 07:27.456
I don't know why.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.792
Because you're trying to do
the right thing, that's why.

07:29.794 --> 07:32.862
But it never ends;
it just keeps getting worse.

07:32.864 --> 07:34.897
And it... it doesn't
get worse than this.

07:34.899 --> 07:36.332
Cat, listen to me, okay?
What's happening,

07:36.334 --> 07:37.566
what they're accusing Vincent
of doing,

07:37.568 --> 07:40.035
what they think he's
gonna do, it's wrong.

07:40.037 --> 07:41.470
All right? Since day one,
it's been wrong,

07:41.472 --> 07:42.872
and we're gonna make it right.

07:42.874 --> 07:45.574
But how? We don't even know
where they're holding him,

07:45.576 --> 07:47.409
let alone who's setting him up.

08:05.730 --> 08:07.363
Come to the door.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.640
Move.

That's Hill's twist.

09:01.221 --> 09:02.354
That's how
he justified trying

09:02.356 --> 09:03.955
to kill me in the first place.

09:03.957 --> 09:05.457
Only you killed Hill instead.

09:05.459 --> 09:07.325
In self-defense.

09:07.327 --> 09:09.027
Yeah, so you
keep saying.

09:09.029 --> 09:11.629
But Hill died weeks ago,
and yet bodies keep piling up

09:11.631 --> 09:12.664
in your wake.

09:12.666 --> 09:14.132
How do you explain that?

09:14.134 --> 09:16.501
Hill didn't kill
Braxton, Garrus,

09:16.503 --> 09:18.870
Ecklund-- why did you?
I didn't.

09:18.872 --> 09:21.940
What about the targets in
that other apartment of yours?

09:21.942 --> 09:24.609
City landmarks,
buildings, bridges.

09:24.611 --> 09:26.778
I don't have
another apartment, okay?

09:26.780 --> 09:29.714
I'm telling you,
someone is setting me up.

09:34.354 --> 09:35.520
Listen to me.

09:36.490 --> 09:37.989
My job is to make sure

09:37.991 --> 09:39.324
that you don't hurt

09:39.326 --> 09:41.092
anybody else.

09:41.094 --> 09:43.795
My job is to find out your plan
so we can stop it.

09:43.797 --> 09:45.296
It's not me.

09:45.298 --> 09:46.865
The hell it's not.

09:48.402 --> 09:50.502
Last chance, Keller.

09:50.504 --> 09:52.203
What's the target?

09:52.205 --> 09:53.872
I-I don't know.

09:53.874 --> 09:55.440
What's... the target?

09:55.442 --> 09:56.541
I don't know.

10:03.517 --> 10:05.750
Titanium alloy,
custom-made.

10:05.752 --> 10:07.819
That's right, Keller,
we know all about you.

10:07.821 --> 10:10.355
We know all about the
super soldier program.

10:10.357 --> 10:13.525
So no matter how much
they juiced you up,

10:13.527 --> 10:15.827
you're never breaking
out of those.

10:24.504 --> 10:26.871
All right.
Wish me luck.

10:26.873 --> 10:29.240
Okay, wait. I can't
ask you to do this.

10:29.242 --> 10:30.708
Well, you didn't. I offered.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.277
Besides, it's no big deal;
I'm just gonna try

10:32.279 --> 10:34.079
to find out what
Agent Dylan knows, that's all.

10:34.081 --> 10:36.681
Yeah, except she trusts you just
about as much as she trusts me.

10:36.683 --> 10:38.950
When she finds out why
you're really doing this,

10:38.952 --> 10:41.953
I just... I don't want this
to bring you down, too.

10:41.955 --> 10:44.055
Look, stop. Enough, okay?

10:44.057 --> 10:45.757
Look, I know we've had
our issues before about

10:45.759 --> 10:47.826
crossing the line and taking
the law into our own hands,

10:47.828 --> 10:49.194
but this time it's different.

10:49.196 --> 10:51.162
It's about more than
law and order, Cat;

10:51.164 --> 10:52.397
it's about right and wrong.

10:52.399 --> 10:53.731
And what's happening
to you and Vincent is wrong.

10:53.733 --> 10:55.500
I want to make it right.

10:55.502 --> 10:57.602
Especially 'cause of
who it's happening to, okay?

10:57.604 --> 10:58.803
Got it?

10:58.805 --> 11:00.505
Got it.
All right.

11:00.507 --> 11:02.607
I don't know what I'd
do without you, Tess.

11:02.609 --> 11:05.477
You better figure it out,
'cause if this works,

11:05.479 --> 11:08.480
you're definitely getting
on that plane next time.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.082
All right.

11:15.655 --> 11:17.755
<i>How are they gonna disappear</i>

11:17.757 --> 11:19.457
if we can't even
find Vincent?

11:19.459 --> 11:21.893
Look, everything's gonna
work out, okay? It has to.

11:21.895 --> 11:23.761
And when it does, we need
to have everything ready,

11:23.763 --> 11:25.230
including new aliases.

11:25.232 --> 11:26.931
Nothing can go wrong
this time.

11:26.933 --> 11:28.133
Well, what went wrong last time

11:28.135 --> 11:29.868
wasn't the names I picked,
it was the guy I picked.

11:29.870 --> 11:31.669
Heather.
Well, it's true, okay?

11:31.671 --> 11:34.439
It doesn't matter how sweet
or cute I thought he was.

11:34.441 --> 11:36.407
He stabbed my
family in the back.

11:36.409 --> 11:37.575
Cat wouldn't even

11:37.577 --> 11:38.910
listen to my apology.

11:38.912 --> 11:40.345
She probably doesn't
want you to apologize.

11:40.347 --> 11:41.546
No, and why would she?

11:41.548 --> 11:43.448
It's not like I borrowed
a sweater; it's a,

11:43.450 --> 11:45.750
“Hey, I'm sorry,
my boyfriend sent your husband

11:45.752 --> 11:47.785
to prison forever. My bad.”

11:47.787 --> 11:48.987
Wait here.

11:48.989 --> 11:50.488
Wait, what are you gonna do
if you run into Kyle?

11:50.490 --> 11:52.423
Probably kick his nuts.

11:52.425 --> 11:54.859
Hey, Sarah.

11:54.861 --> 11:57.662
Kyle just wanted me
to pick something up for him.

12:17.617 --> 12:19.984
But there's gonna be a lot
of political pressure on this,

12:19.986 --> 12:21.686
so let's just
keep it really quiet.

12:21.688 --> 12:23.521
Okay, so we have
to coordinate efforts...

12:26.226 --> 12:28.626
What are you doing in here?

12:30.096 --> 12:32.197
I was, uh... I was
just looking for my files.

12:32.199 --> 12:33.364
Your files?

12:33.366 --> 12:34.566
Yeah.
I sent them over

12:34.568 --> 12:35.867
to 125th yesterday.

12:35.869 --> 12:38.303
Well, I didn't get them.

12:38.305 --> 12:40.305
You still think
there's gonna be an attack?

12:40.307 --> 12:42.840
I don't know. Why don't
you ask your partner?

12:42.842 --> 12:44.242
Oh, come on, you really think

12:44.244 --> 12:45.843
if Cat knew something,
she wouldn't tell you?

12:45.845 --> 12:46.945
You think she'd let

12:46.947 --> 12:48.546
innocent people die
just to protect her husband?

12:48.548 --> 12:50.748
Why don't you tell me.
Whatever you do,

12:50.750 --> 12:52.417
don't tell me
that she doesn't know more,

12:52.419 --> 12:54.052
because you and I both know that

12:54.054 --> 12:56.721
she's been hiding stuff from
DHS every step of the way.

12:58.158 --> 13:01.759
Chandler's dirty, Vargas,
just like her husband.

13:01.761 --> 13:04.128
And just like you, if you
don't do the right thing here.

13:06.533 --> 13:08.499
You know what?

13:08.501 --> 13:10.134
Trust me...

13:10.136 --> 13:12.837
I'm definitely doing
the right thing.

13:13.540 --> 13:14.872
Excuse me.

13:19.079 --> 13:20.578
You're a disgrace.

13:20.580 --> 13:22.947
An embarrassment
to anybody who ever knew you,

13:22.949 --> 13:24.415
who ever cared about you.

13:24.417 --> 13:26.050
You've got the wrong guy.

13:26.853 --> 13:28.620
Tell me the target.

13:28.622 --> 13:30.421
Screw you!

13:31.491 --> 13:33.191
How can you even

13:33.193 --> 13:35.927
admit the truth when you
won't even face it yourself?

13:35.929 --> 13:37.762
You're not a
doctor anymore.

13:37.764 --> 13:39.530
You're not anybody
anymore!

13:39.532 --> 13:41.366
You're a terrorist!
No, I'm not!

13:41.368 --> 13:43.635
Yeah, it started the moment you
first enlisted, too, didn't it?!

13:43.637 --> 13:45.770
You left med school,

13:45.772 --> 13:46.804
a cushy job, so what,

13:46.806 --> 13:48.106
you could... you could get

13:48.108 --> 13:49.574
even with Osama?

13:49.576 --> 13:50.908
Huh? Is that it?

13:50.910 --> 13:52.477
For what he did
to your brothers?

13:52.479 --> 13:53.444
No, no, no, no...

13:53.446 --> 13:54.646
This is all about revenge,

13:54.648 --> 13:56.014
isn't it?
You got it wrong.

13:56.016 --> 13:57.382
You got it wr...

13:59.619 --> 14:02.153
<i>Any word from your brothers?</i>

14:02.155 --> 14:05.323
They're still trying
to get everyone out.

14:05.325 --> 14:07.292
<i>They're still</i>
<i>trying to get everyone out.</i>

14:07.294 --> 14:08.693
Pathetic.
You're pathetic!

14:08.695 --> 14:11.162
Get up!

14:11.164 --> 14:13.665
Became a model soldier,
too, didn't you?

14:13.667 --> 14:16.301
First in your class,
captain, Special Forces.

14:16.303 --> 14:17.935
You couldn't wait
to get out in the field

14:17.937 --> 14:19.504
and kill those bastards,
could you?

14:19.506 --> 14:21.939
When they attacked us,
I... I joined to help, okay?

14:21.941 --> 14:23.675
What's wrong with that?
What is wrong with that

14:23.677 --> 14:25.109
is what you became
because of it.

14:25.111 --> 14:26.177
You became
a killing machine.

14:26.179 --> 14:27.979
No.
But you wanted more.

14:27.981 --> 14:29.914
That's why you volunteered

14:29.916 --> 14:31.749
for the super soldier
program, isn't it?

14:31.751 --> 14:33.785
No. No, you got it wrong.

14:33.787 --> 14:35.753
Nobody knows
what the Army did to you,

14:35.755 --> 14:37.622
because the Army tried
to cover it up,

14:37.624 --> 14:38.923
tried to eliminate
everybody

14:38.925 --> 14:40.291
<i>who volunteered</i>
<i>for the program.</i>

14:40.293 --> 14:41.359
But you,

14:41.361 --> 14:42.794
you got away,

14:42.796 --> 14:44.662
juiced up and pissed off.

14:44.664 --> 14:47.432
<i>You found your way home,</i>
<i>driven by demons</i>

14:47.434 --> 14:51.235
and-and anger at the
people and the country

14:51.237 --> 14:53.671
who hurt you,
turned you into a mutant!

14:53.673 --> 14:55.173
I was just trying to survive!

14:55.175 --> 14:56.474
<i>How many people</i>

14:56.476 --> 14:58.643
did you kill
while you were in hiding, huh?

14:58.645 --> 15:00.378
Tell me.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.814
<i>How many people</i>
<i>did you get even with</i>

15:02.816 --> 15:04.482
<i>for what they did to you?</i>

15:04.484 --> 15:06.484
You can't stop

15:06.486 --> 15:08.820
what you've become,
so you killed Braxton

15:08.822 --> 15:09.954
and anyone else

15:09.956 --> 15:11.656
<i>who picked up where</i>

15:11.658 --> 15:12.990
the super soldier
program left off,

15:12.992 --> 15:15.193
still looking for revenge!

15:15.195 --> 15:16.160
I didn't kill them!

15:16.162 --> 15:17.462
<i>Sure you did,</i>

15:17.464 --> 15:18.496
<i>and you won't stop!</i>

15:18.498 --> 15:19.564
<i>You will not stop</i>

15:19.566 --> 15:20.765
until you rip out

15:20.767 --> 15:22.266
<i>every last remnant of Muirfield</i>

15:22.268 --> 15:25.203
<i>by the root,</i>
<i>stop it once and for all,</i>

15:25.205 --> 15:27.705
<i>so nobody will ever make</i>
<i>another monster</i>

15:27.707 --> 15:29.707
like you again!

15:29.709 --> 15:30.742
<i>Say it!</i>

15:32.412 --> 15:34.812
I'm not a monster!

15:34.814 --> 15:37.882
I'm not a monster.
I'm not a monst...

15:37.884 --> 15:39.984
No!

15:39.986 --> 15:42.053
I'm not a monster!

15:42.055 --> 15:43.254
No!

15:43.256 --> 15:44.188
I'm not a monster.

15:44.190 --> 15:46.524
I'm not a monster.

15:46.526 --> 15:49.694
I'm not a monster.
I'm not a m...

15:54.636 --> 15:56.302
<i> Hey,</i>
<i>what's the apartment number?</i>

15:56.304 --> 15:57.904
12C.

15:57.906 --> 15:59.472
V. Keller.

15:59.474 --> 16:01.007
They put his name
on the mailbox.

16:01.009 --> 16:02.408
Not very subtle.

16:02.410 --> 16:05.278
Hey, whoever's framing Vincent
isn't going for subtle.

16:07.082 --> 16:08.848
What are you doing?!

16:08.850 --> 16:10.416
Cat, it's a DHS crime scene.

16:10.418 --> 16:12.819
We can't have any witnesses,
all right?

16:12.821 --> 16:14.187
Okay, you guys, don't panic.

16:14.189 --> 16:15.721
This is a fire alarm.
Come down, please.

16:15.723 --> 16:17.590
Don't panic.
Just take it easy.

16:18.493 --> 16:20.059
What?

16:20.061 --> 16:22.395
Come on. Before
FDNY shows up.

16:38.313 --> 16:39.412
Holy crap.

16:39.414 --> 16:40.847
No wonder DHS

16:40.849 --> 16:42.982
is taking this so seriously.

16:42.984 --> 16:44.851
Someone really did
their homework.

16:44.853 --> 16:47.286
How long did you say
this place has been here?

16:47.288 --> 16:49.188
According to
the landlord, Vincent--

16:49.190 --> 16:50.556
or whoever wants us to believe
it's Vincent--

16:50.558 --> 16:52.258
moved in about a month ago.

16:52.260 --> 16:54.393
Right when Graydal figured out
he was a beast.

16:54.395 --> 16:57.830
Vincent's brothers,
the Towers, Afghanistan, Zhao.

16:57.832 --> 16:59.465
It's like they're trying
to make him look like

16:59.467 --> 17:01.267
he has a motive,
that he's out of control, crazy.

17:01.269 --> 17:02.635
Yeah, and bent
on revenge

17:02.637 --> 17:04.704
for all the super soldier crap.

17:04.705 --> 17:06.638
They want DHS
to connect it all to Vincent.

17:06.641 --> 17:08.540
Yeah, and blow
something up, but what?

17:09.777 --> 17:12.111
There's just enough here
to make DHS suspect Vincent,

17:12.113 --> 17:13.846
but there's not enough
for us to figure out

17:13.848 --> 17:14.814
what the guy's gonna do.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.082
So it can't be stopped.

17:16.084 --> 17:17.916
So Vincent has to take the fall?
Yeah.

17:17.919 --> 17:19.986
It's got to be
Braxton's beast, right?

17:19.988 --> 17:22.288
He's the one taking out the
cabal; he needs a scapegoat.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.624
It makes sense. What better way
to get away with this

17:24.626 --> 17:26.358
than to blame it
on another beast?

17:27.362 --> 17:29.228
This guy knows
so much about Vincent,

17:29.230 --> 17:30.563
and we have never even seen him.

17:30.565 --> 17:32.698
It's like
he's taken everything

17:32.700 --> 17:33.833
that Vincent's ever
gone through,

17:33.835 --> 17:35.434
everything that
we've ever gone through,

17:35.436 --> 17:38.171
and turned it against him.

17:38.173 --> 17:39.438
As though all of the good things

17:39.440 --> 17:40.806
that we've done together
don't matter.

17:40.808 --> 17:42.275
Cat, I doubt all the people
you've saved

17:42.277 --> 17:43.576
over the years
would agree with that.

17:43.578 --> 17:45.778
Yeah, but it's coming back
to haunt us.

17:46.581 --> 17:48.181
And all of it started
with Vincent

17:48.183 --> 17:50.516
trying to make up for
what happened to his brothers.

17:50.518 --> 17:54.053
With me trying to make up for
what my mom did to Vincent.

17:54.055 --> 17:56.055
All right, Cat,
figuring out

17:56.057 --> 17:58.124
how you got into this
position is not as important

17:58.126 --> 18:00.126
as getting out of it, okay?
So let's get Braxton's beast

18:00.128 --> 18:01.994
so we can save yours.
Let's go.

18:17.679 --> 18:20.079
You know, after this,
I'm gonna go home

18:20.081 --> 18:21.480
and take a nice,

18:21.482 --> 18:23.950
long, hot shower

18:23.952 --> 18:26.686
and have a big plate
of spaghetti and meatballs

18:26.688 --> 18:29.488
with the wife and kids,
maybe watch a movie.

18:29.490 --> 18:31.724
Then I'll be back.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.960
But you...

18:33.962 --> 18:35.628
you're never gonna leave,

18:35.630 --> 18:38.231
not unless you tell me
the target.

18:38.233 --> 18:41.100
And then you'll
let me go, huh?

18:47.075 --> 18:48.975
I don't think so.

18:48.977 --> 18:51.944
No, you'll go to supermax,
but at least you'll be alive.

18:51.946 --> 18:53.879
It's better than
a lethal injection,

18:53.881 --> 18:56.716
which is what you'll get if we
can't stop what you got planned.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.952
Don't you think I would've
told you by now if I knew?

18:59.954 --> 19:02.421
Nothing is more powerful
than revenge.

19:03.324 --> 19:05.291
Except...

19:05.293 --> 19:06.826
for maybe love.

19:06.828 --> 19:10.329
You love your wife,
don't you?

19:10.331 --> 19:11.331
Catherine?

19:12.634 --> 19:15.067
Hey. If you cooperate,

19:15.069 --> 19:18.204
maybe I can arrange a meet,
a conjugal visit maybe.

19:18.206 --> 19:19.905
Would you like that?

19:19.907 --> 19:22.308
Keep her out of this.
Can't.

19:22.310 --> 19:24.076
Aside from the fact
that we already busted her,

19:24.078 --> 19:26.479
she means everything to you,
doesn't she?

19:26.481 --> 19:29.682
But you will never
see her again,

19:29.684 --> 19:30.983
Keller, ever.

19:30.985 --> 19:33.719
And worse, she will live
the rest of her life

19:33.721 --> 19:35.154
having been scarred

19:35.156 --> 19:36.255
by you,

19:36.257 --> 19:37.923
having been married
to a terrorist

19:37.925 --> 19:40.359
who killed hundreds
of innocent people.

19:40.361 --> 19:44.096
And if you won't save yourself,
don't you want to save her?

19:46.067 --> 19:47.533
Think about it, Keller.

20:02.817 --> 20:05.351
<i>You're Vincent Keller.</i>

20:05.353 --> 20:08.888
<i>You're Vincent Keller.</i>

20:08.890 --> 20:11.223
You're Vincent Keller.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.827
You've just been...
hiding out here?

20:14.829 --> 20:16.829
JT's the only one
I can trust.

20:16.831 --> 20:19.365
Except you-you go out there
and you save people.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.801
No.
You saved me.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.970
I guess it reminds me
of who I used to be.

20:24.972 --> 20:26.872
A doctor?

20:27.742 --> 20:29.408
Human.

21:01.642 --> 21:03.442
<i>I mean, look at us.</i>

21:03.444 --> 21:05.878
We're stealing identities,
faking passports.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.279
Like, what the hell
are we doing?

21:07.281 --> 21:09.448
The only thing we <i> can</i> do
at this point.

21:09.450 --> 21:10.916
Oh, I know you're right;
it's just...

21:10.918 --> 21:12.251
I can't believe
it's actually happening.

21:12.253 --> 21:15.588
Even best-case scenario,
if Cat and Vincent disappear,

21:15.590 --> 21:18.190
I'd be losing my sister
possibly forever.

21:19.260 --> 21:20.059
Come on.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.395
It's gonna be okay.

21:23.664 --> 21:26.132
Somehow, some way...

21:26.134 --> 21:28.300
it's gonna be okay.

21:30.304 --> 21:31.604
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:33.040 --> 21:33.739
What's wrong?

21:33.741 --> 21:35.141
I'm fine.
Nothing.

21:36.010 --> 21:37.543
Uh, find anything?
Uh, nothing good.

21:37.545 --> 21:38.811
Whoever's framing Vincent's

21:38.813 --> 21:40.613
pretty much nailed him
to the cross.

21:40.615 --> 21:41.881
But we have an idea.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.416
We have to find
Braxton's beast.

21:43.418 --> 21:44.617
Before he does whatever
he's planning on doing.

21:44.619 --> 21:46.385
Even if you find him,
how are you gonna catch him?

21:46.387 --> 21:47.920
I mean, you weren't able
to do either last time.

21:47.922 --> 21:48.459
I know.

21:48.483 --> 21:50.157
But at least
we know where to start.

21:50.158 --> 21:52.258
The fourth cabal member.

21:52.260 --> 21:53.993
Exactly.
That's who we think he's after.

21:53.995 --> 21:55.361
We think the terrorist attack is

21:55.363 --> 21:57.229
just a smoke screen
to put it on Vincent.

21:57.231 --> 21:59.131
But his real goal is
to kill the fourth guy,

21:59.133 --> 22:01.200
finish his revenge on everyone
who turned him into a beast.

22:01.202 --> 22:02.501
Which means if
we can figure out

22:02.503 --> 22:03.836
who the fourth
cabal member is...

22:03.838 --> 22:05.771
We can probably figure out
where the attack's gonna be,

22:05.773 --> 22:06.772
'cause he should be there.

22:06.774 --> 22:07.840
Garrus got a text from

22:07.842 --> 22:09.408
the last member
right before he was killed.

22:09.410 --> 22:10.810
Do you still have
his cell phone?

22:10.812 --> 22:12.778
Yeah, but even if we
figure out who sent it,

22:12.780 --> 22:14.647
it doesn't mean we're
gonna find him in time,

22:14.649 --> 22:16.515
or that we're gonna
stop Braxton's beast

22:16.517 --> 22:17.683
before the attack.

22:17.685 --> 22:20.453
Only a beast can stop
another beast.

22:25.026 --> 22:27.660
Okay, wait.
What are you saying?

22:27.662 --> 22:28.527
That...

22:28.529 --> 22:30.129
that that's it? We just...

22:30.131 --> 22:32.164
There's nothing else to do
or try? We just give up?

22:34.735 --> 22:36.469
No way.

22:36.471 --> 22:37.336
Cat...

22:37.338 --> 22:39.371
No, wait, Cat...

22:39.373 --> 22:40.706
Cat...

22:48.049 --> 22:51.650
♪ Play with the monsters
inside my head ♪

22:51.652 --> 22:55.254
♪ Awaken the demons
from under my bed ♪

22:55.256 --> 22:58.858
♪ They run wild
and wish me dead... ♪

22:58.860 --> 23:01.494
You want to be alone?

23:07.368 --> 23:08.701
You shouldn't blame her,
you know.

23:08.703 --> 23:10.970
I don't.
Not anymore.

23:10.972 --> 23:14.006
She didn't know
she'd start all this.

23:15.610 --> 23:18.777
So then why are you here?

23:18.779 --> 23:22.348
Because everything changed
the night that she was killed.

23:22.350 --> 23:25.718
I certainly did.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.219
You were gonna be
a lawyer.

23:29.657 --> 23:33.058
Yeah, and I became a cop
to get justice for her.

23:33.895 --> 23:36.195
Hey.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.731
You did get justice.

23:38.733 --> 23:40.633
You and Vincent
took down Muirfield.

23:40.635 --> 23:42.034
Did we?

23:43.137 --> 23:45.704
I thought so,
until Braxton and his buddies

23:45.706 --> 23:47.573
decided to start up
where they left off,

23:47.575 --> 23:49.742
and now here
I am again.

23:51.245 --> 23:53.245
Still.

23:56.918 --> 23:58.651
Look, about Kyle...

23:58.653 --> 24:01.253
Heather, this is not about Kyle.

24:02.623 --> 24:04.657
He was just trying
to protect you from Vincent.

24:04.659 --> 24:07.293
This...

24:07.295 --> 24:11.230
this isn't even about Mom.

24:11.232 --> 24:14.099
This is about me.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.839
This is about how I got here,

24:20.841 --> 24:24.910
how I kept fighting for justice
long after I already had it.

24:27.415 --> 24:31.350
I just kept feeling like
I had to do more.

24:31.352 --> 24:34.987
More justice, more bad guys,
worse situations.

24:36.857 --> 24:38.424
But it was never enough.

24:38.426 --> 24:41.427
No matter how many...

24:41.429 --> 24:44.196
bad guys I went after,
no matter how many I caught,

24:44.198 --> 24:46.799
I could never fix this.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.474
I could never bring Mom back.

24:55.476 --> 24:57.610
♪ Take me home ♪

24:58.946 --> 25:01.280
♪ Take me home... ♪

25:01.282 --> 25:03.582
And now I might
lose Vincent, too.

25:03.584 --> 25:05.818
No.

25:08.489 --> 25:12.758

25:12.760 --> 25:16.228

25:34.419 --> 25:35.244
Do you mind?

25:35.245 --> 25:36.123
What? I'm
just walking.

25:36.147 --> 25:37.408
No, you're driving me crazy.

25:37.409 --> 25:39.876
I'm having enough trouble
trying to find out who the last

25:39.877 --> 25:41.877
- cabal member is.
- Yeah? So?

25:41.879 --> 25:43.178
So your
asset seizure computer

25:43.180 --> 25:44.647
isn't exactly
state-of-the-art, you know.

25:44.649 --> 25:46.215
Okay, well, beggars can't
be choosers, all right?

25:46.217 --> 25:48.117
And you need to hurry up.
I got to get it

25:48.119 --> 25:49.985
back to Property before
they notice it's missing.

25:49.987 --> 25:52.021
Property's the least
of our problems, believe me.

25:52.023 --> 25:53.555
Beast target now, please.

25:53.557 --> 25:56.358
Just out of curiosity,
are you just ignoring the fact

25:56.360 --> 25:57.826
that even if I find the name,

25:57.828 --> 25:59.628
we can't stop a beast
without Vincent,

25:59.630 --> 26:01.697
or are you living
in complete denial?

26:01.699 --> 26:02.665
Complete denial, all right?

26:02.667 --> 26:04.266
Continue.
Continue what?

26:04.268 --> 26:06.435
Haranguing me?
Look, very funny, okay?

26:06.437 --> 26:07.670
We can't just do nothing, right?

26:07.672 --> 26:09.071
We'll worry about
stopping Braxton's beast

26:09.073 --> 26:11.040
after we figure out
who he's after.

26:11.042 --> 26:12.675
You know, hopefully,
we'll get lucky.

26:12.677 --> 26:14.610
Fine, then what?
Then we stop a terrorist attack.

26:14.612 --> 26:16.512
Okay? And either get Cat
and Vincent exonerated

26:16.514 --> 26:19.048
or get them the hell
out of here, for good.

26:19.050 --> 26:22.017
What happened to not wanting
to cover anymore?

26:22.019 --> 26:23.986
Or to wanting a normal life?

26:23.988 --> 26:26.255
I still want normal, but this
is the right thing to do.

26:26.257 --> 26:28.323
Like you always say,
they deserve better.

26:28.325 --> 26:30.059
Then what?

26:30.061 --> 26:31.560
Then what, what?
I just told you.

26:31.562 --> 26:33.896
No, I mean, then what about you?

26:33.898 --> 26:35.431
Because after this,

26:35.433 --> 26:36.799
one way or the other,

26:36.801 --> 26:38.701
all this goes away
with Cat and Vincent.

26:38.703 --> 26:40.602
I know, I know.

26:42.273 --> 26:44.440
You know, hopefully,

26:44.442 --> 26:47.309
maybe we'll all get
our happy ending.

26:51.415 --> 26:54.116
Back to work, please.

27:01.358 --> 27:03.525
Vincent.

27:06.330 --> 27:07.930
Vincent.

27:10.267 --> 27:12.134
Catherine?

27:12.136 --> 27:14.103
You can't give up.

27:14.105 --> 27:16.872
Not now. Not after
everything we've gone through.

27:18.609 --> 27:20.843
I'm losing my damn mind.

27:20.845 --> 27:22.878
No, you're not.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.947
You know that I am always
here with you.

27:25.716 --> 27:26.749
You know that.

27:31.322 --> 27:33.956
I can't, I can't, I can't do it.

27:33.958 --> 27:36.125
You've sacrificed too much.

27:36.127 --> 27:38.694
<i>We've</i> sacrificed
too much.

27:38.696 --> 27:40.496
It can't end this way.
Don't let it.

27:40.498 --> 27:42.931
No, they-they...

27:42.933 --> 27:45.134
they think
I'm some kind of monster.

27:45.136 --> 27:46.602
Well, you know
better than that.

27:49.740 --> 27:52.407
Come on, we can
figure this out, together.

27:52.409 --> 27:53.809
Okay.

27:54.745 --> 27:56.545
Okay, first we got...

27:56.547 --> 28:00.015
we got to figure out
who's trying to set me up.

28:00.017 --> 28:01.950
Okay, whoever it is,
they know what you really are,

28:01.952 --> 28:03.986
who you really are.

28:03.988 --> 28:06.188
It c-can't be Braxton's beast.

28:06.190 --> 28:07.422
It makes no sense.

28:07.424 --> 28:11.126
And everybody else
who knows about me,

28:11.128 --> 28:12.261
they're all dead.

28:12.263 --> 28:13.428
Are they?

28:14.498 --> 28:15.764
Think about it, Vincent.

28:15.766 --> 28:17.032
Who would want
to set you up

28:17.034 --> 28:18.467
more than anybody?

28:18.469 --> 28:20.335
And who would
know exactly

28:20.337 --> 28:21.436
how to do it?

28:21.438 --> 28:23.038
S-Somebody that...

28:23.040 --> 28:24.673
that knows about my past,

28:24.675 --> 28:26.275
knows what I am.

28:26.277 --> 28:28.844
Somebody that wants
to cover their own ass.

28:28.846 --> 28:30.045
Yes.

28:31.015 --> 28:32.548
Exactly.

29:04.849 --> 29:07.349
Son of a bitch.

30:28.198 --> 30:30.299
A crown prince?

30:30.301 --> 30:31.733
That's the fourth cabal member?

30:31.735 --> 30:32.698
How the hell are
we gonna get to him?

30:32.699 --> 30:35.471
Hey, at least we don't have to go to
Saudi Arabia. He's coming here.

30:35.472 --> 30:36.505
Yeah, Tuesday,
which gives us

30:36.507 --> 30:38.473
exactly no time to save him.

30:38.475 --> 30:40.075
Plus, he's a head of state.

30:40.077 --> 30:41.910
Won't he be completely
surrounded by security?

30:41.912 --> 30:43.378
Look, but if we can figure out
where he's gonna be,

30:43.380 --> 30:44.980
we might be able
to narrow down

30:44.982 --> 30:46.662
where the beast
is planning on killing him.

30:47.918 --> 30:50.118
What's going on?
You guys okay?

30:50.120 --> 30:51.920
Yeah, did you find
the fourth guy?

30:51.922 --> 30:54.156
Yeah, but we don't know
how to get to him to warn him,

30:54.158 --> 30:55.791
let alone save him.

30:55.793 --> 30:57.359
First things first.

30:57.361 --> 30:59.027
He's a head of state.
Maybe we go to Secret Service.

30:59.029 --> 31:01.430
And tell them what,
a beast is gonna blow him up?

31:01.432 --> 31:03.198
Yeah, leave
the beast stuff out of it.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.533
Nobody's gonna
believe us anyway.

31:04.535 --> 31:06.201
DHS certainly
doesn't trust us.

31:06.203 --> 31:08.603
Still, now we know
who Braxton's beast is after,

31:08.605 --> 31:12.007
and saving him might be
the only way to save...

31:13.677 --> 31:15.377
Vincent?

31:15.379 --> 31:16.645
There's no beast.

31:16.647 --> 31:18.981
It's Braxton.

31:20.985 --> 31:22.484
He's alive.

31:33.043 --> 31:34.676
Coffee?

31:34.678 --> 31:36.844
Maybe something stronger?

31:41.051 --> 31:43.685
Vincent?

31:43.687 --> 31:45.720
Are you all right?

31:45.722 --> 31:48.156
Yeah.

31:48.158 --> 31:51.292
What'd they do to you
in there?

31:51.294 --> 31:54.195
Oh, you know,
they just...

31:54.197 --> 31:57.465
tried to get
me to confess.

31:57.467 --> 31:59.934
How?

31:59.936 --> 32:02.170
Every trick
in the book.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.040
Hey, don't worry, okay?

32:06.042 --> 32:09.177
They didn't break me.

32:09.179 --> 32:10.578
Thanks to you.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.146
Thanks to me?

32:12.148 --> 32:13.314
Yeah.

32:13.316 --> 32:15.283
You got me through in there.

32:15.285 --> 32:18.987
You got me through
what the hell was going on.

32:18.989 --> 32:21.923
Braxton's beast,
it doesn't even exist.

32:21.925 --> 32:24.325
But you think Braxton does?

32:24.327 --> 32:26.027
He's alive.

32:26.029 --> 32:28.763
He's got to be.
There's no other explanation.

32:28.765 --> 32:30.498
Come on.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.799
And you can expect that

32:31.801 --> 32:33.868
to clear up around the weekend,
then we're gonna see

32:33.870 --> 32:36.337
a low pressure system
moving in from the southwest.

32:36.339 --> 32:37.839
So, was that Braxton's body

32:37.841 --> 32:39.574
in the morgue or not?

32:39.576 --> 32:40.575
Not.

32:40.577 --> 32:42.176
How'd you figure it out?

32:42.178 --> 32:43.411
A lot of little pieces

32:43.413 --> 32:44.712
that just didn't add up

32:44.714 --> 32:46.214
about this other
so-called beast, right?

32:46.216 --> 32:47.949
But if Braxton was behind
this thing all along,

32:47.951 --> 32:50.885
then these pieces, they
fit, they make sense.

32:50.887 --> 32:52.787
He needed us to think
that there was another beast,

32:52.789 --> 32:54.222
so that we would
follow its trail.

32:54.224 --> 32:56.691
Braxton must've
switched blood samples

32:56.693 --> 32:58.226
with the real victim,
postmortem.

32:58.228 --> 33:00.361
After he brutally murdered
the other poor guy

33:00.363 --> 33:02.730
to make it look like
some beast attack.

33:02.732 --> 33:04.966
Which is the exactly what he did
to Garrus and Ecklund, but why?

33:04.968 --> 33:06.701
To cover his tracks.
Garrus said that

33:06.703 --> 33:08.436
the State Department
was investigating them.

33:08.438 --> 33:10.738
This must've been Braxton's way
of getting away with it.

33:10.740 --> 33:12.340
By faking his own death
and disappearing.

33:12.342 --> 33:14.876
Yeah, before his partners
could use him as a scapegoat.

33:14.878 --> 33:16.511
So no one would come
looking for him,

33:16.513 --> 33:19.247
and no one would reopen
the investigation.

33:19.249 --> 33:20.882
That's why he sent out
these bounty hunters

33:20.884 --> 33:22.383
looking for me in the
first place, okay?

33:22.385 --> 33:24.285
Braxton had his exit strategy
from the beginning.

33:24.287 --> 33:25.553
He needed
it to look like

33:25.555 --> 33:27.388
a super soldier
was out for revenge.

33:27.390 --> 33:30.191
Which, unfortunately,
it does now more than ever

33:30.193 --> 33:31.826
since you escaped--
especially the way you escaped.

33:31.828 --> 33:33.594
Okay, so then what do we do?

33:33.596 --> 33:35.596
Now we got to prove

33:35.598 --> 33:37.131
that Braxton is still alive

33:37.133 --> 33:38.766
and he's behind it all.

33:38.768 --> 33:40.501
Before you get caught again.

33:40.503 --> 33:42.036
And before Braxton
kills the prince,

33:42.038 --> 33:44.072
along with God knows
how many innocent people.

33:45.842 --> 33:48.810
So, how are we gonna
find this maniac?

33:58.188 --> 34:00.354
All right, tell Vincent
he's got four minutes

34:00.356 --> 34:01.989
to try to beast-track Braxton,
all right?

34:01.991 --> 34:03.291
Five, tops.
Okay.

34:07.797 --> 34:10.498
Heather still feels bad
about what Kyle did.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.934
Come on, Heather doesn't
have to apologize for a thing.

34:12.936 --> 34:15.536
That's what I keep
trying to tell her,

34:15.538 --> 34:16.804
but she won't let it go.

34:16.806 --> 34:19.139
She keeps trying to
make things right.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.375
Sound familiar?

34:21.377 --> 34:22.643
Who? Me or you?

34:22.645 --> 34:24.344
Both of us.

34:26.516 --> 34:28.649
Why do you think we keep
getting into these situations?

34:28.650 --> 34:30.717
We can't let
things go, either.

34:30.719 --> 34:33.554
I know. I was thinking
the same thing myself.

34:33.556 --> 34:36.257
You know, when I was
in that cell, I realized that

34:36.259 --> 34:39.627
I keep trying to make up for
what happened to my brothers.

34:39.629 --> 34:41.362
And you with your mom, right?

34:41.364 --> 34:42.663
Yeah,

34:42.665 --> 34:44.431
and my father.

34:44.434 --> 34:45.800
Let's not forget
everything he did.

34:45.802 --> 34:48.636
How could I forget?

34:48.638 --> 34:51.172
Come on, you really think
we bring this

34:51.174 --> 34:52.572
on ourselves?

34:52.574 --> 34:54.641
I think that we've done
a lot of good

34:54.643 --> 34:57.512
because of it, but...

34:57.514 --> 34:59.280
it's definitely cost us, too.

34:59.282 --> 35:00.948
Maybe it's time
to change, you know?

35:00.950 --> 35:03.251
Maybe we should stop trying
to fight every damn fight.

35:05.555 --> 35:08.055
Yeah, but we have
one fight left.

35:09.192 --> 35:11.359
Braxton is the only
person who knew

35:11.361 --> 35:13.928
enough about you to
set this place up.

35:13.930 --> 35:14.962
Can you track him?

35:14.964 --> 35:17.698
Yeah, I'm trying.

35:36.986 --> 35:38.386
That's strange.

35:38.388 --> 35:40.121
What?

35:40.123 --> 35:43.157
It's like he keeps coming and
going, planting new evidence.

35:43.159 --> 35:44.358
How could he do that
without being spotted?

35:45.528 --> 35:46.928
Maybe he's closer
than we think.

35:46.930 --> 35:48.563
Hey, is everything okay?

35:48.565 --> 35:50.064
Oh, my God, he's here.

35:51.601 --> 35:53.968
Who?
Braxton!

35:53.970 --> 35:56.404
He just came out
of the building.

35:57.440 --> 35:58.906
It's Braxton.

35:59.842 --> 36:01.976
He's right outside.
No, no, tell her

36:01.978 --> 36:04.612
not to go anywhere near him.
Heather, stay where you are!

36:05.481 --> 36:06.347
Okay, he's walking away.

36:06.349 --> 36:07.648
I'll follow him.

36:07.650 --> 36:09.150
Excuse me.

36:12.322 --> 36:14.121
Hey.
Hey, where'd she go?

36:14.123 --> 36:15.590
Who, Heather?
She's following Braxton.

36:15.592 --> 36:16.958
Heather, can you hear me?
Where are you?

36:16.960 --> 36:17.960
Excuse me.

36:25.868 --> 36:27.668
Go! Go!

36:27.670 --> 36:29.136
Heather!
Heather!

36:31.374 --> 36:32.807
Stand back!
Oh, my God!

36:32.809 --> 36:34.175
All right.

36:34.177 --> 36:35.443
I'm sorry.

36:35.445 --> 36:37.445
You're gonna be okay.

36:37.447 --> 36:39.814
I'm so sorry.
It's okay, you're gonna be all right.

36:39.816 --> 36:41.582
Tess, go after Braxton, go.

36:41.584 --> 36:44.352
Go! Hurry!

36:44.354 --> 36:46.654
No, Vincent, you can't get
caught again because of me.

36:46.656 --> 36:48.656
She's right. You got to get
out of here, Vincent.

36:48.658 --> 36:49.757
Okay, okay.

36:49.759 --> 36:51.225
Keep pressure on,
all right?

36:51.227 --> 36:52.827
Tell the paramedics there's
no exit wound, all right?

36:52.829 --> 36:54.195
You're gonna be
absolutely fine.

36:54.197 --> 36:55.229
Okay?
Okay.

37:24.210 --> 37:25.542
Hey.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.778
Hey.

37:27.780 --> 37:30.080
The doctor said the bullet
missed everything important.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.216
You're gonna be okay.

37:32.218 --> 37:33.884
Did you catch him?

37:33.886 --> 37:35.019
No.

37:35.021 --> 37:36.954
No, he got away.

37:36.956 --> 37:38.555
But so did Vincent.

37:38.557 --> 37:39.990
At least for now.

37:39.992 --> 37:41.659
What are you gonna do?

37:41.661 --> 37:43.827
We're gonna find Braxton,
that's what.

37:43.829 --> 37:47.031
We can't leave until we do,
for a lot of reasons.

37:47.033 --> 37:48.899
You're right.

37:48.901 --> 37:50.868
This does feel never-ending.

37:50.870 --> 37:52.670
Yeah, we'll see about that.

37:54.507 --> 37:57.574
But you have to learn
when to give up the fight, too.

37:59.178 --> 38:01.979
Heather, I'm not mad at you.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.849
And I'm not mad at Kyle.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.885
Neither is Vincent.

38:08.888 --> 38:11.689
Kyle wants what's best for you,
and so do I.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.527
Promise me
that you'll forgive him?

38:17.763 --> 38:19.163
Yeah.

38:21.300 --> 38:24.535
Promise me you'll say good-bye
before you go away.

38:37.083 --> 38:39.049
Of course.

38:48.394 --> 38:49.893
So?

38:49.895 --> 38:52.796
So what happened
to Mr. A.D.A.?

38:52.798 --> 38:55.265
That's none of
your business.

38:55.267 --> 38:57.968
Eh, didn't work out.
Happens.

38:57.970 --> 39:00.371
Could've told you that
he wasn't your type though.

39:00.373 --> 39:02.706
You don't even know him.
I know you. I know your type.

39:02.708 --> 39:03.364
Yeah, what's my type?

39:03.388 --> 39:05.377
Well, it's not dating
another cop, that's for sure.

39:05.378 --> 39:06.443
Okay, he's not a cop.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.612
A.D.A.-- close enough.

39:08.614 --> 39:09.913
No.

39:09.915 --> 39:13.117
You need something...

39:13.119 --> 39:14.618
different.

39:14.620 --> 39:18.756
Somebody that
keeps you on your toes,

39:18.758 --> 39:20.691
guessing.
Really?

39:20.693 --> 39:22.326
Makes you laugh.

39:22.328 --> 39:24.261
Oh, my God.

39:24.263 --> 39:25.329
You got somebody in mind?

39:25.331 --> 39:27.097
Uh, maybe.

39:28.901 --> 39:31.135
You gonna be okay?

39:31.137 --> 39:32.936
With whatever happens next?

39:32.938 --> 39:34.171
You mean with Vincent?

39:34.173 --> 39:36.006
Yeah.

39:36.008 --> 39:37.941
As long as
we get Braxton,

39:37.943 --> 39:40.577
as long as Vincent and Cat
get through this alive, I am.

39:40.579 --> 39:44.314
Yeah. Yeah, well,
there's no guarantees there.

39:45.684 --> 39:48.519
It's gonna work out.

39:48.521 --> 39:50.454
It has to.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.689
All right.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.458
I'll hold you to it.

before he does
something major.

41:10.536 --> 41:14.037
You know, it's like
we've come full circle.
