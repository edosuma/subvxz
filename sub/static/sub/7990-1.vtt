02:03.916 --> 02:05.998
Cut, great.

02:05.999 --> 02:08.271
That's a wrap, everyone!

02:38.332 --> 02:40.856
Great job, fantastic!

02:42.291 --> 02:44.530
Fantastic!

02:46.624 --> 02:49.148
That was amazing!

02:49.457 --> 02:52.111
Nice. Beautiful job.

02:52.582 --> 02:55.106
That was glorious. Thank you.

<i>destined to live happily ever

04:57.332 --> 05:00.498
From here you can see the
whole of Monaco, Mr Hitchcock.

05:00.499 --> 05:03.023
Yes, I know.

05:09.707 --> 05:11.956
You are to refer to
her as Your Highness.

05:11.957 --> 05:15.572
Or if you speak French,
you can call her Votre Altesse.

05:18.707 --> 05:23.365
Just Altesse is also acceptable,
but Highness is not. Nor is Princess.

05:34.291 --> 05:36.815
Are you coming or not, Mr Hitchcock?

05:40.541 --> 05:44.581
Remember to nod your head when you
first make her presence, but do not bow.

05:44.582 --> 05:47.106
She's not the Queen of England.

05:50.874 --> 05:52.915
Oh! You've grown so big!

05:52.916 --> 05:57.027
This is for you. First prize of
the Monaco Young Poets' society.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.248
Oh!

05:58.249 --> 06:00.498
Ma'am, you can't bend down.

06:00.499 --> 06:03.023
Oh... Pardon.

06:04.374 --> 06:06.331
Hitch!

06:06.332 --> 06:09.568
This is the part where I say, "Cut!"

06:10.082 --> 06:12.155
Marnie.

06:13.291 --> 06:15.317
Marnie?

06:17.082 --> 06:18.915
So who's the leading man?

06:18.916 --> 06:24.248
I don't know. Cubby Broccoli just made
a spy movie with some Scottish fellow

06:24.249 --> 06:26.165
he's raving about.

06:26.166 --> 06:29.234
We go into production in spring.

06:29.499 --> 06:33.231
And Universal will
pay you $1 million.

06:33.874 --> 06:36.528
Well, it's not about
the money, Hitch.

06:36.957 --> 06:40.275
It's going to be the role
of a lifetime, Gracie.

06:44.457 --> 06:46.981
Do I look that unhappy?

06:49.541 --> 06:52.065
You look tired.

06:54.082 --> 06:56.441
Where's Rainier?

06:56.957 --> 06:58.998
We rarely see each other.

06:58.999 --> 07:01.570
He er... He works a lot.

07:04.999 --> 07:07.623
We've prepared a room at the
palace for you. You'll stay?

07:07.624 --> 07:09.790
- I have to get back to LA.
- Oh, please!

07:09.791 --> 07:12.915
I'm sorry, I left Evan
alone with Cary Grant.

07:12.916 --> 07:16.123
And goodness knows what
they've done to my Birds script.

07:16.124 --> 07:17.706
How is Cary?

07:17.707 --> 07:19.540
Cary's great.

07:19.541 --> 07:23.456
But his wife still sticks pins
in your effigy every night.

07:23.457 --> 07:25.998
You're still an artist, Gracie.

07:25.999 --> 07:27.748
Don't forget it.

07:27.749 --> 07:29.941
Hitch!

07:30.291 --> 07:32.649
I'm fine.

07:34.791 --> 07:37.315
Doesn't get better than this.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.822
Highness.

08:17.166 --> 08:20.581
Hey, when I screw a woman,
I'm in it for the long haul, so to speak.

08:20.582 --> 08:23.831
That's what I said to Maria.
Hey, be proud of your scandals.

08:23.832 --> 08:26.556
What else are they gonna write
about when you're gone?

08:27.357 --> 08:31.740
- That's not how it happened at all.
- No.

08:32.624 --> 08:34.748
I was hoping we could talk privately.

08:34.749 --> 08:37.539
President De Gaulle is
worried for French jobs.

08:37.541 --> 08:41.206
We have to do something.
Our treasury is practically empty.

08:41.207 --> 08:43.164
So you steal our taxes...

08:43.166 --> 08:44.706
to pay for all of this?

08:44.707 --> 08:47.790
This is all an image,
Monsieur Denard.

08:47.791 --> 08:50.873
Your president knows that.
This is all we have left to sell.

08:50.874 --> 08:55.373
Madam, did you know you are sitting
on the world's largest penis?

08:56.274 --> 09:00.206
- My bar stools, made from whale's scrotum.
- Ari! Please!

09:00.207 --> 09:03.290
It's all right, Antoinette.
Mr Onassis was joking.

09:03.291 --> 09:06.194
Ari, would you like me
to confiscate your boat?

09:06.666 --> 09:08.706
I'd like to leave now.

09:08.707 --> 09:11.231
You're his sister, you have to stay.

09:13.624 --> 09:15.706
Are any of your
Hollywood friends here?

09:15.707 --> 09:18.331
Uh... no. No. This is
Mr Onassis's party.

09:18.332 --> 09:21.271
He likes to be the biggest
drunk on the boat.

09:21.457 --> 09:25.290
Well, our point is, the British will
always side with the Americans.

09:25.291 --> 09:28.608
Their Atlanticism will be
the end of our culture.

09:29.332 --> 09:33.248
President de Gaulle believes we must pool
our wealth and finance a third pillar,

09:33.249 --> 09:35.498
between the Soviets and
the United States.

09:35.499 --> 09:37.774
That's what Europe must become.

09:39.041 --> 09:41.706
- What should I do about my children?
- About what?

09:41.707 --> 09:44.540
Well, they're Monegasque
and they're American.

09:44.541 --> 09:48.072
Perhaps I should drop them
in the middle of the ocean?

09:49.957 --> 09:53.415
France is stuck in a terrible
war in Algeria, Your Highness.

09:53.416 --> 09:55.456
Many lives have been lost.

09:55.457 --> 09:59.237
The very stability of our
country is under threat.

09:59.291 --> 10:02.739
That means the stability
of Europe is under threat.

10:03.582 --> 10:06.900
One would ask why you are
fighting a war in Africa.

10:08.832 --> 10:10.873
Conflict is often a necessary evil.

10:10.874 --> 10:13.232
Especially in the colonies.

10:13.707 --> 10:16.776
Oh, but colonialism
is so last century.

10:19.207 --> 10:24.315
I suspect one shouldn't occupy
a princess with such... matters.

10:26.499 --> 10:28.331
I was brought up to participate.

10:28.332 --> 10:31.956
My father would have been most upset
to see someone without enthusiasm.

10:31.957 --> 10:33.831
Of course.

10:33.832 --> 10:35.706
It is the American way.

10:35.707 --> 10:39.831
Perhaps if it was the European way,
we wouldn't have had Fascism, Communism

10:39.832 --> 10:43.364
or the need for your
president's third pillar.

10:48.374 --> 10:50.898
This is not America, Grace!

10:51.041 --> 10:53.998
- People don't just speak their minds.
- And why not?

10:53.999 --> 10:56.790
Because that man is the
chief treasury agent...

10:56.791 --> 10:58.623
That man is a bully!

10:58.624 --> 11:01.248
He's the chief treasury
agent to Charles de Gaulle!

11:01.249 --> 11:03.290
The most powerful voice in Europe.

11:03.291 --> 11:06.790
And I need him on my side if I'm
ever to modernise this country.

11:06.791 --> 11:10.248
- So what did you expect me to say?
- Say nothing! Say nothing!

11:10.249 --> 11:12.873
Because everything you
say has consequences.

11:12.874 --> 11:15.398
Not now, Madge. Not now.

11:17.249 --> 11:21.646
Isn't this what you wanted me to
teach Caroline and Albert? Isn't it?

11:21.791 --> 11:24.315
Never be afraid to speak your mind?

11:25.082 --> 11:27.820
That's what you said
you loved about me.

11:41.999 --> 11:44.025
Madge said...

11:44.582 --> 11:47.106
Hitchcock came to see you.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.697
Madge said that?

11:50.499 --> 11:53.023
Yes, he came to see how I was.

11:53.916 --> 11:56.440
He was passing through, and...

11:58.749 --> 12:01.273
It was nice to see him.

12:02.582 --> 12:05.106
I wish you told me.

12:06.082 --> 12:08.606
I'd like to have seen him.

13:09.749 --> 13:14.248
This hospital's been
abandoned for years.

13:14.249 --> 13:17.081
We don't even know if
the floors are sound.

13:17.082 --> 13:20.365
Ma'am, we simply cannot
justify these repairs.

13:20.999 --> 13:24.731
The hospital already accounts
for most of our spending.

13:24.999 --> 13:27.248
How about the palace
gives you an endowment,

13:27.249 --> 13:29.331
and the Red Cross
Committee matches it?

13:29.332 --> 13:31.165
If you pay to expand the orphanage,

13:31.166 --> 13:35.331
the retirement homes will expect you
to do the same, and then the schools.

13:35.332 --> 13:37.373
And you don't have the funds.

13:37.374 --> 13:41.485
My dear Countess, it's really
very, very simple and necessary.

13:41.666 --> 13:46.607
All we have to do is convert this
space into an open dormitory.

13:46.707 --> 13:51.898
And then we put partitions and each child
will have their own separate living area.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.819
Simple.

13:59.041 --> 14:02.165
Maybe we can vote for it in
our plenary session tomorrow.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.665
But now we must get back,

14:03.666 --> 14:07.123
there's the small issue of the
Annual Red Cross Ball to organise.

14:07.124 --> 14:08.956
But that's not due until October.

14:08.957 --> 14:12.572
It's the most important event
in our social calendar.

14:13.832 --> 14:18.110
Besides, you just don't have the
money for renovations right now.

14:18.874 --> 14:22.748
I'm sorry, Countess, I mistakenly thought
we were here to repair a hospital.

15:02.207 --> 15:07.956
103 new companies registered offices
in Monaco in the last two years.

15:07.957 --> 15:10.956
90 per cent of them
relocated from France.

15:10.957 --> 15:13.481
All of them came for your zero-tax.

15:14.499 --> 15:16.540
And what do you want
us to do about it?

15:16.541 --> 15:21.774
- Stop courting them.
- Oliver, come here! Come on!

15:24.041 --> 15:26.081
- Casinos.
- Come here, now!

15:26.082 --> 15:28.123
That's what I've inherited, Emile.

15:28.124 --> 15:29.331
Good dog!

15:29.332 --> 15:31.290
A playground for French aristocrats.

15:31.291 --> 15:32.831
And that's a problem?

15:32.832 --> 15:35.206
Oh, for the 10,000 people
who live here, yes.

15:35.207 --> 15:38.146
Ordinary people need
schools, hospitals.

15:38.541 --> 15:40.581
We make nothing, we export nothing.

15:40.582 --> 15:43.706
If France is going to drain
Monaco of all she has,

15:43.707 --> 15:47.415
it's not unreasonable to expect
French businesses to pay for it.

15:47.416 --> 15:50.698
We find ourselves at an
impasse, Your Highness.

15:50.999 --> 15:55.165
Because the President wants you to
not only impose income tax in Monaco,

15:55.166 --> 15:57.331
but to pay the proceeds to France.

16:00.749 --> 16:02.790
You want us to pay tax to France?

16:02.791 --> 16:05.206
This is a French protectorate

16:05.207 --> 16:08.940
which has only ever existed
because of French good will.

16:10.957 --> 16:13.481
This is a sovereign nation.

16:14.749 --> 16:16.790
Oliver, come on, boy.

16:22.374 --> 16:26.948
My peers in Paris are not
as understanding as I am.

16:27.916 --> 16:31.566
I'm to return tomorrow
with your full acceptance.

16:34.124 --> 16:36.648
Please work with me, Your Highness.

16:37.624 --> 16:40.123
Does de Gaulle really want
the children of Monaco

16:40.124 --> 16:41.706
to grow up to be croupiers?

16:41.707 --> 16:44.540
Some would say that
would be an improvement.

16:44.541 --> 16:48.206
Some of Monaco's children are
running around like their mother,

16:48.207 --> 16:52.071
the offspring of a
Philadelphia bricklayer.

16:57.082 --> 16:58.646
Let me go.

16:59.249 --> 17:01.738
- Let me go.
- Mr. Pelletier...

17:02.082 --> 17:05.779
May I, Mr. Pelletier?

17:07.790 --> 17:09.873
He slapped a French representative?

17:09.874 --> 17:12.943
<i>Yes, he sent me away,
expelled me from Monaco.</i>

17:13.957 --> 17:17.654
<i>Tell De Gaulle he's becoming
dangerously anti-French.</i>

17:48.166 --> 17:51.498
<i>You've been the principality
priest for a long time.</i>

17:51.499 --> 17:54.081
You must know how complicated
things are here, Tuck.

17:54.082 --> 17:56.706
- Yes, I know, Gracie.
- I feel I made a mistake.

17:56.707 --> 17:59.231
What kind of mistake?

18:00.874 --> 18:03.398
Everything I do or say is wrong.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.823
Everything.

18:07.624 --> 18:10.230
Do you know how I spent my afternoon?

18:11.249 --> 18:14.415
I was trying to persuade the
good ladies of the Red Cross

18:14.416 --> 18:17.123
that repairing a hospital wing

18:17.124 --> 18:21.484
might just be more important
than... planning a ball.

18:22.582 --> 18:25.106
You're in Monaco, Grace.

18:27.999 --> 18:30.523
I know I'm in Monaco.

18:35.457 --> 18:39.439
What do you think would happen
if I went back to making movies?

18:39.832 --> 18:41.775
What's it about?

18:44.041 --> 18:46.565
A frigid, compulsive thief.

18:47.124 --> 18:48.456
Really? Hm.

18:48.457 --> 18:50.498
But it's a great role.

18:50.499 --> 18:52.525
I'm sure it is.

18:52.957 --> 18:55.481
Have you spoken to Ray about this?

18:55.749 --> 18:57.790
What do you think?

18:57.791 --> 18:59.831
Of course not, it's always...

18:59.832 --> 19:02.570
I don't know, it's always
politics with him.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.706
Ray is never gonna accept
the idea of his princess

19:05.707 --> 19:09.108
going back into the movies,
you know that, Gracie.

19:14.332 --> 19:19.373
<i>After 7 years of conflict in Algeria,
disorder reigns in France.</i>

19:19.374 --> 19:22.498
<i>To consolidate power and
secure her borders,</i>

19:22.499 --> 19:25.706
<i>the government must
finance the war effort.</i>

19:25.707 --> 19:27.706
<i>In its sights, Monaco.</i>

19:27.707 --> 19:32.290
<i>Mr. Denard spoke to the French
this afternoon from the Elysée.</i>

19:32.291 --> 19:34.998
<i>On the orders of the
French President,</i>

19:34.999 --> 19:40.165
<i>Monaco has a 6-month ultimatum
to begin taxing her citizens</i>

19:40.166 --> 19:44.230
<i>and cease her open courting
of French companies.</i>

19:44.791 --> 19:48.654
<i>Unless they stop scheming
to steal French revenue,</i>

19:50.374 --> 19:54.290
<i>and demand that Monaco
become part of France.</i>

19:54.291 --> 19:57.998
Our food, our water, our power,
everything runs through France.

19:57.999 --> 20:00.206
We'd be squashed in an instant.

20:00.207 --> 20:02.731
Ray, you don't have an army.

20:02.832 --> 20:06.565
You're in no position to
hardball the French President.

20:07.916 --> 20:11.206
It's so nice to have a real
family meal for a change.

20:11.207 --> 20:15.521
I only wish I could stay and enjoy it.
I have a meeting with Onassis.

20:15.624 --> 20:18.823
What if de Gaulle doesn't
accept your apology?

20:18.874 --> 20:22.248
Then we'll have the shortest
war in the history of mankind.

20:22.249 --> 20:24.581
What happens in a war, Maman?

20:24.582 --> 20:28.165
Oh... Big bad men decide
that they're tired of talking

20:28.166 --> 20:31.456
and so they er...
pull each other's noses.

20:31.457 --> 20:33.981
Someone once asked my father,

20:35.624 --> 20:39.404
"If you could be any monarch,
which monarch would you be?"

20:40.332 --> 20:42.358
He said...

20:42.541 --> 20:45.123
"The Tsar of Russia,
or the Prince of Monaco.

20:45.124 --> 20:48.415
The Tsar, because he knows the
name of none of his subjects,

20:48.416 --> 20:50.456
- the Prince of Monaco...
- Thanks.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.331
...because he knows all of them."

20:52.332 --> 20:55.568
- Why don't you just pay him?
- How?

20:56.124 --> 20:58.290
We could mortgage some of the estate.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.815
It's already mortgaged.

21:06.874 --> 21:10.206
How did it go with the Red Cross?
Will they pay for the orphanage?

21:10.207 --> 21:13.831
The treasury'll put up a share, which
leaves Countess Baciochi no choice

21:13.832 --> 21:15.456
but to match it with her funds.

21:15.457 --> 21:18.623
You're forcing her to do something
other than for her own benefit?

21:18.624 --> 21:20.665
You should see the conditions, Ray.

21:20.666 --> 21:24.611
These children, they can't
live like this. It's appalling.

21:28.291 --> 21:30.815
Well, don't upset her too much, OK?

21:30.832 --> 21:33.081
I need her husband's
political support.

21:33.082 --> 21:36.281
We're running out of money
and he has a lot of it.

21:45.374 --> 21:47.898
Hitchcock offered me a role.

21:50.207 --> 21:53.608
I think it might be
inappropriate to accept it now.

21:57.124 --> 21:59.540
Were you considering accepting?

21:59.541 --> 22:02.065
I wanted to ask you.

22:02.416 --> 22:06.196
Well, if you really can't do without it,
I won't stand in your way.

22:06.666 --> 22:08.498
But would it be appropriate?

22:08.499 --> 22:11.956
I don't want people saying that I'm
running away or abandoning you.

22:11.957 --> 22:14.481
Why would they say that?

22:16.666 --> 22:20.280
The only thing I ask is,
you manage the publicity.

22:20.499 --> 22:22.442
Really?

22:22.791 --> 22:24.831
It's a risk. But take it if you must.

22:24.832 --> 22:27.356
I miss it.

22:28.832 --> 22:31.356
I can't stand it, I'll die!

22:32.249 --> 22:33.665
I'll die!

22:33.666 --> 22:36.190
If you touch me again, I'll die!

22:40.332 --> 22:43.248
I can't stand it, I'll die!
If you touch me again...

22:43.249 --> 22:45.773
If you touch me again, I'll die!

22:52.332 --> 22:54.939
I can't stand it, I'll die.

22:56.082 --> 22:58.938
If you touch me again, I'll die!

23:07.791 --> 23:10.456
<i>Gentlemen, I have wonderful news.</i>

23:10.457 --> 23:13.740
I am going to make a film
for Mr Alfred Hitchcock.

23:14.916 --> 23:17.415
And I'd like to introduce
to you Rupert Allan,

23:17.416 --> 23:20.235
my publicist from Hollywood.

23:21.916 --> 23:24.356
Try not to look too astonished.

23:26.832 --> 23:30.915
No Princess of Monaco has ever
taken to the stage before, Altesse.

23:30.916 --> 23:33.290
It's not the stage, it's the screen.

23:33.291 --> 23:35.915
There is a first time for
everything, Mr Delavenne.

23:35.916 --> 23:38.873
Yes, what about your duties,
ma'am, and the crisis?

23:38.874 --> 23:42.998
As your press officer, I don't know how
to present this without causing outrage.

23:42.999 --> 23:45.581
Monsieur Cornet!
I can be a mother and a wife,

23:45.582 --> 23:49.081
and hold down two jobs without the
people getting too upset, can't I?

23:49.082 --> 23:52.456
- But what about the Prince?
- The Prince is very supportive.

23:52.457 --> 23:56.522
As the Minister of the Interior,
it is my duty to protest.

23:57.416 --> 23:59.706
What if the studio
wants to publicise it?

23:59.707 --> 24:01.498
It'll cause unrest.

24:01.499 --> 24:04.706
Mr Hitchcock has
agreed to be discreet.

24:04.707 --> 24:07.873
Yes, they will not publish
until the palace publishes.

24:07.874 --> 24:10.248
Which won't be until
this crisis is over.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.540
<i>Making her return to Hollywood,</i>

24:12.541 --> 24:14.956
<i>her Serene Highness
Princess Grace of Monaco</i>

24:14.957 --> 24:18.331
<i>has accepted to appear
for Mr Alfred Hitchcock</i>

24:18.332 --> 24:20.856
<i>in Universal Pictures' Marnie.</i>

24:30.582 --> 24:32.395
Good.

24:32.749 --> 24:35.040
And this is the only
copy of the release?

24:35.041 --> 24:37.565
Yes.

24:41.666 --> 24:42.831
And action!

24:42.832 --> 24:45.331
I'm gonna be the queen
of the all Western...

24:47.374 --> 24:49.415
Phyllis, the microphone's in film.

24:49.416 --> 24:51.040
We're going to be famous!

24:51.041 --> 24:53.415
- I'm John Wayne!
- No, I'm John Wayne!

24:53.416 --> 24:55.123
- Ha ha!
- Action!

24:55.124 --> 24:57.648
Yes, that's it.

24:58.791 --> 25:00.831
Spare me the indignation, Madge.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.623
- We're just playing.
- Maman is an actress!

25:03.624 --> 25:06.610
One more time before bed. And action!

25:08.707 --> 25:10.248
It's a good likeness, no?

25:10.249 --> 25:11.706
Yeah.

25:11.707 --> 25:16.566
Our readers want to know, how important
has the hospital project been to you?

25:16.707 --> 25:18.790
I think that people have
to work hard enough

25:18.791 --> 25:21.998
to make sure that the standards
for those who aren't as privileged

25:21.999 --> 25:24.290
are no different than
from those who are.

25:24.291 --> 25:26.815
Wherever in the world they may be.

25:26.916 --> 25:29.123
Not everybody is lucky
enough to marry a prince.

25:32.124 --> 25:33.498
Au revoir!

25:33.499 --> 25:36.236
Move back, guys, move back.

25:36.916 --> 25:39.290
Will you let President
de Gaulle's ultimatum

25:39.291 --> 25:41.581
affect your philanthropic
work, ma'am?

25:41.582 --> 25:45.081
Oh, I think we'll all find out it's
been a terrible misunderstanding.

25:45.082 --> 25:47.855
When will you start on
Marnie, Your Highness?

25:48.582 --> 25:49.998
I'm sorry?

25:49.999 --> 25:51.623
Look magazine.

25:51.624 --> 25:55.623
We received a copy of your press
release today from Universal Pictures.

25:55.624 --> 25:57.831
"Princess Grace has
accepted to appear

25:57.832 --> 26:00.623
during her summer vacation
in the motion picture Marnie,

26:00.624 --> 26:04.735
to be made by Mr Alfred Hitchcock
and shot in the United States."

26:05.499 --> 26:08.781
Are you going back to
Hollywood, Your Highness?

26:09.457 --> 26:10.748
No, no.

26:12.249 --> 26:14.623
<i>Hollywood rocked,
and the world as well,</i>

26:14.624 --> 26:17.331
<i>as Academy Award-winning
actress Grace Kelly</i>

26:17.332 --> 26:21.373
<i>has been announced to star in Alfred
Hitchcock's new picture, Marnie.</i>

26:21.374 --> 26:24.415
<i>Fans of the silver screen
are sure to be delighted,</i>

26:24.416 --> 26:27.081
<i>but what does this mean
for the State of Monaco?</i>

26:28.707 --> 26:32.108
No, no, no. Focus on
the bloody birds.

26:34.832 --> 26:36.693
Hello?

26:37.082 --> 26:39.689
Yes, of course. Put her through.

26:40.541 --> 26:42.498
Grace?

26:42.499 --> 26:45.290
Hitch! The studio said
they would wait. That...

26:45.291 --> 26:48.028
The press release
came from the palace.

26:48.124 --> 26:50.706
The studio only published a response.

26:50.707 --> 26:52.748
Are you sure?

26:52.749 --> 26:56.123
Yes, I told Wasserman
I'd leave Universal

26:56.124 --> 26:58.648
if there was any monkey business.

27:00.582 --> 27:02.623
It's going to be tricky now.

27:02.624 --> 27:04.665
I'll need some more time.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.415
Can you wait?

27:06.416 --> 27:08.456
Of course, darling.

27:08.457 --> 27:13.565
The world needs Grace Kelly
back on the big screen now.

27:14.582 --> 27:16.941
Hitch, thank you.

27:22.707 --> 27:26.206
"The fact that wife Grace Kelly
is returning to her movie career,

27:26.207 --> 27:27.831
no matter what the reason,

27:27.832 --> 27:32.229
is indicative that in some ways, something
has gone wrong with her marriage."

27:32.582 --> 27:34.540
Why do they write such lies?

27:34.541 --> 27:36.998
Try to avoid what Hedda
Hopper's been writing.

27:36.999 --> 27:39.831
I think she's been after your
obituary for a while, now.

27:39.832 --> 27:43.873
The bigger question... is how did the
release get out from Mr Cornet's office?

27:43.874 --> 27:45.206
Yes.

27:45.207 --> 27:47.373
Well, I have the only
key to the bureau.

27:47.374 --> 27:50.081
And only one other person
knew where I put the release.

27:50.082 --> 27:52.748
- How dare you, Mr Cornet?
- A mistake may have happened.

27:52.749 --> 27:55.748
There are certain things about
which I do not make mistakes.

27:55.749 --> 27:57.623
Maybe it wasn't a mistake.

27:57.624 --> 27:59.915
Don't play that game
with me, young lady.

27:59.916 --> 28:02.440
OK, that is enough. Thank you.

28:03.291 --> 28:08.030
I really don't think this was an
accident, Tuck. Somebody leaked it.

28:08.374 --> 28:11.748
- Why would they do this to me?
- This isn't about you, Grace.

28:11.749 --> 28:15.040
Somebody is using you to light
a fire under Ray's problem.

28:15.041 --> 28:17.606
This is all about how
de Gaulle reacts.

28:17.607 --> 28:20.373
Why does everything have
to be so complicated?

28:20.374 --> 28:22.447
Listen to me.

28:22.541 --> 28:27.415
In 15 minutes, Ray is going to ask de
Gaulle to come to the negotiating table.

28:27.416 --> 28:31.331
If he even suspects there's
a French spy in the palace,

28:31.332 --> 28:36.357
he's going to reach into the phone and
punch de Gaulle right on the nose.

28:36.957 --> 28:40.206
Is there anybody on your
staff you trust unequivocally?

28:40.207 --> 28:43.311
Phyllis. I hand-picked her.

28:43.916 --> 28:47.081
All right, get her and conduct
your own investigation.

28:47.082 --> 28:49.248
At all costs,
Ray mustn't be troubled.

28:49.249 --> 28:52.188
Ray mustn't be troubled by what?

28:52.541 --> 28:56.206
Altesse was wondering whether
we should fire Mr Cornet.

28:56.207 --> 29:00.706
It seems the Press Department's rather
messed up the Hitchcock announcement.

29:00.707 --> 29:02.748
Well, I did say it was a risk.

29:02.749 --> 29:05.273
You did say you'd manage it.

29:07.207 --> 29:09.731
You should see to the children.

29:12.124 --> 29:13.581
- Hold on tight, Oliver!
- Giddy up!

29:13.582 --> 29:14.831
Come on, push!

29:14.832 --> 29:17.439
I got you!

29:17.666 --> 29:18.790
Giddy up!

29:18.791 --> 29:20.373
Hey, Mommy, look at me!

29:20.374 --> 29:22.980
Everybody in!

29:23.457 --> 29:25.415
...a ball in the middle of the pool.

29:25.416 --> 29:26.915
You're gonna dive in and get it.

29:26.916 --> 29:28.706
The first one to catch
it is the winner.

29:28.707 --> 29:31.123
- Yes.
- Off you go.

29:31.124 --> 29:32.498
Right.

29:32.499 --> 29:34.040
Here we go.

29:34.041 --> 29:35.748
Christian!

29:35.749 --> 29:38.190
I told you to stop doing that.

29:38.707 --> 29:40.498
You'll hurt yourself!

29:40.499 --> 29:41.748
Come here.

29:41.749 --> 29:44.206
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Yes?

29:44.207 --> 29:45.415
- There we go.
- Sure.

29:45.416 --> 29:47.498
- Look happy now.
- Cheese!

29:47.499 --> 29:49.748
Look at me! I'm swimming!

29:49.749 --> 29:51.581
- Mommy!
- Over here!

29:51.582 --> 29:54.165
Christian, get your cousins
and get ready for lunch.

29:54.166 --> 29:57.331
<i>...in the next film by

Family is all that matters.

you must protect them.

Nothing else.

It doesn't ever get easier, does it?

30:30.541 --> 30:34.081
This is supposed to be
a summer break! Oh...

30:34.082 --> 30:36.938
Politics is never on
vacation, Miss Callas.

30:37.332 --> 30:39.748
Oh, please, it's been two hours.

30:39.749 --> 30:42.190
And they are still holed up in there.

30:42.332 --> 30:44.405
Oh...

30:44.916 --> 30:47.165
I noticed you've got stables.

30:47.166 --> 30:48.581
Why? Do you ride?

30:48.582 --> 30:50.206
Do I ride?

31:20.457 --> 31:22.483
- Grace!
- Grace!

31:22.916 --> 31:24.290
- Grace!
- Grace!

31:25.832 --> 31:30.415
Do you know Ari tried to get
me to quit singing, huh?

31:30.416 --> 31:32.498
He did?

31:32.499 --> 31:34.665
But I'm an artist.

31:34.666 --> 31:38.695
Who can't expect to be
adored and left alone.

31:38.999 --> 31:41.248
Who can't hide.

31:41.249 --> 31:43.248
Who can't give up.

31:43.249 --> 31:44.540
I haven't given up.

31:44.541 --> 31:46.498
I know.

31:46.499 --> 31:48.498
Grace Kelly can quit.

31:48.499 --> 31:51.105
Princess Grace can quit.

31:51.416 --> 31:54.022
But what's inside...

31:54.416 --> 31:58.813
Mr President, I've already
given our allegiance.

32:00.666 --> 32:02.415
We'll match your French rates.

32:02.416 --> 32:04.915
What your companies want to
do after that is up to them.

32:04.916 --> 32:08.123
<i>No! You will tax all of Monaco.</i>

32:08.124 --> 32:10.165
<i>You will pay the proceeds to France.</i>

32:10.166 --> 32:13.998
That's not negotiation,
that's... extortion.

32:13.999 --> 32:16.081
<i>You've made a fool of me.</i>

32:16.082 --> 32:18.498
<i>How will it look to
Kennedy and Khrushchev?</i>

32:18.499 --> 32:20.998
<i>We noticed you gave

32:20.999 --> 32:23.248
<i>and all I read in the newspapers</i>

32:23.249 --> 32:26.581
<i>is that Grace Kelly is
going back to Hollywood!</i>

32:26.582 --> 32:32.790
<i>You agree to my terms by tonight, or I'll
send Monaco back into the Dark Ages.</i>

32:40.499 --> 32:42.581
What happens now?

32:42.582 --> 32:45.581
He waits until tomorrow
and executes a blockade.

32:45.582 --> 32:49.398
And we are not in the UN,
so we have nobody to turn to.

32:49.582 --> 32:52.040
Why don't you call Kennedy?

32:52.041 --> 32:54.331
The Americans are calling
it a French matter.

32:54.332 --> 32:56.456
OK, so let's make it more than that.

32:56.457 --> 32:59.915
You have European neighbours.
They can put pressure on de Gaulle.

32:59.916 --> 33:02.373
Let's make Monaco's security
a threat to Europe.

33:02.374 --> 33:04.331
Arrange a summit.

33:04.332 --> 33:06.373
Make them choose sides.

33:06.374 --> 33:10.190
Bring Rupert Allan to
work exclusively for you.

33:10.332 --> 33:15.498
You seem very eager to send
Europe into war, Mr Onassis.

33:15.499 --> 33:18.105
I have investments to protect.

33:18.499 --> 33:23.026
And you, you have the
Princess by your side.

33:23.582 --> 33:26.331
A damsel in distress, huh?

33:26.332 --> 33:30.040
Some would say she's more
hindrance than benefit.

33:30.041 --> 33:33.240
Then maybe it's time you
brought her into line.

33:33.457 --> 33:38.067
Hey, come on, man, you're her
husband. Take a firmer hand.

33:41.207 --> 33:43.581
It's all just so unfair.

33:43.582 --> 33:47.040
Antoinette, we don't talk
state affairs over lunch.

33:47.041 --> 33:49.647
My love, your stepmother's right.

33:50.291 --> 33:53.040
Let's forget our troubles
for an hour or two.

33:53.041 --> 33:55.540
Who put out white lilies?

33:55.541 --> 33:57.373
I did.

33:57.374 --> 34:01.355
Oh, white lilies are only supposed
to be for funerals, Grace.

34:02.041 --> 34:04.790
Well, I asked Madge and she said
that it would be acceptable.

34:04.791 --> 34:06.748
I only said white flowers, ma'am.

34:06.749 --> 34:09.498
- I didn't say white lilies.
- Madge,

34:09.498 --> 34:11.998
you knew they only had lilies
when I placed the order.

34:11.998 --> 34:14.853
I suppose your hair
was Madge's fault too.

34:15.581 --> 34:16.873
What time? 7.30?

34:16.873 --> 34:18.290
My hair?

34:18.291 --> 34:19.998
Who told you to cut it that short?

34:19.998 --> 34:22.623
I'm not gonna hang
around much longer.

34:22.623 --> 34:24.998
We are still in 1962, right?

34:24.998 --> 34:26.665
The year has nothing to do with it.

34:26.666 --> 34:28.998
What? I think Grace's
hair looks very elegant.

34:28.998 --> 34:31.790
- It looks dreadful.
- It's the model look.

34:31.791 --> 34:34.998
- She's a modern woman.
- She isn't. She's the Princess of Monaco.

34:34.998 --> 34:38.373
Oh, come on, Ray! You can't be
the great moderniser one minute...

34:38.373 --> 34:40.040
Call Hitchcock!

34:40.041 --> 34:41.998
Turn him down publicly.

34:41.998 --> 34:44.331
We'll make a show of how
happy you are here.

34:44.331 --> 34:46.581
That you're permanently
retiring from acting.

34:46.581 --> 34:49.248
- Why? Because de Gaulle says so?
- Because I say so.

34:49.248 --> 34:51.873
- That's not your decision to make.
- I'm your husband.

34:51.873 --> 34:54.480
I won't do it, Ray.

34:57.582 --> 34:59.748
I didn't make you marry me.

34:59.749 --> 35:02.248
- I didn't make you come here.
- Ray, this is absolutely...

35:02.249 --> 35:05.165
What is it that Hollywood
can give you that I can't?

35:05.166 --> 35:07.123
Ray, it's just a movie.

35:07.124 --> 35:09.730
You were just an actress.

35:14.624 --> 35:17.540
Have you thought that this
might not be about a movie?

35:17.541 --> 35:21.581
Have you? Have you thought that de Gaulle
is looking for any excuse to take Monaco?

35:21.582 --> 35:23.623
Even if it means turning
you against me?

35:23.624 --> 35:26.123
Have you? No! Because you
don't listen and you don't think.

35:26.124 --> 35:29.998
Everybody tip-toes around you while you
blow this way and that with indecision,

35:29.999 --> 35:31.665
too afraid to say how you really feel

35:31.666 --> 35:35.197
and too paralysed with the fear you
might just be in over your head.

35:36.332 --> 35:38.737
- Oh!
- Oh!

35:44.874 --> 35:46.831

- Do you believe in fairy tales, Tuck?

36:43.999 --> 36:45.123
No.

36:45.124 --> 36:48.276
I believe in "happily ever after".

36:51.957 --> 36:55.821
When I won my Oscar, do you know
what my father told the press?

36:56.624 --> 37:00.290
"I always thought it would be her sister
Peggy because anything Grace could do,

37:00.291 --> 37:02.897
Peggy could do better."

37:06.124 --> 37:08.730
Deep down he was furious.

37:09.666 --> 37:13.316
That I'd rather be an actress
than be his ticket in.

37:14.249 --> 37:19.938
Every achievement...
was a disappointment.

37:22.207 --> 37:26.023
So I never thought that living
with Rainier would be any easier.

37:26.707 --> 37:29.361
Well, of course it isn't any easier.

37:29.666 --> 37:32.123
- But he does love you.
- Oh...

37:32.124 --> 37:34.730
He loves an image of me.

37:36.207 --> 37:38.814
Do you love him?

37:42.124 --> 37:44.730
Tuck...

37:47.082 --> 37:50.151
What happens if I get a divorce?

37:54.041 --> 37:56.165
Well, I...

37:56.166 --> 38:01.206
I think we both know that you'd never
be able to come back here and...

38:01.207 --> 38:03.814
Your children would suffer the most.

38:04.707 --> 38:08.440
They are heirs to a
European throne, Grace.

38:11.207 --> 38:16.030
And add to that the fact that you would
have been a failure as a Princess.

38:19.916 --> 38:22.522
I don't want to say no to the movie.

38:22.832 --> 38:25.415
I don't.

38:25.416 --> 38:27.331
Well, don't.

38:27.332 --> 38:29.939
Let's see what happens...

38:30.874 --> 38:33.480
There's consequence.

38:36.166 --> 38:39.415
When people dream of
marrying royalty,

38:39.416 --> 38:42.864
they very rarely comprehend
what it really means.

38:43.666 --> 38:45.748
And you have to add to that

38:45.749 --> 38:50.228
a culture that's one million miles
away from anything you know.

38:50.582 --> 38:51.831
I know.

38:51.832 --> 38:53.706
I know very well.

38:53.707 --> 38:56.314
I've been here 15 years.

38:56.874 --> 38:59.480
And you're still here.

39:01.374 --> 39:03.998
This is a heartless kingdom.

39:03.999 --> 39:07.731
Ray needs me and he needs you.

39:09.207 --> 39:11.814
It doesn't feel that way.

39:12.291 --> 39:15.490
You scare him, don't you?

39:16.082 --> 39:20.498
You give a damn, and you're forcing
him to step out of his uniform.

39:20.499 --> 39:23.105
He's just not ready yet.

39:26.874 --> 39:29.206
Tuck...

39:29.207 --> 39:31.581
I don't know how I'm gonna
keep living with him.

39:31.582 --> 39:33.915
I don't know how I'm gonna
spend the rest of my life

39:33.916 --> 39:36.819
in this place where I can't be me.

39:37.916 --> 39:40.522
And who is that?

39:41.124 --> 39:43.730
Grace Kelly, movie star?

39:44.666 --> 39:46.665
You invented her.

39:46.666 --> 39:52.331
You learned a certain kind of walk and
you perfected a certain kind of accent.

39:52.332 --> 39:54.290
And you did it beautifully.

39:54.291 --> 39:57.956
But now you're just a housewife
with two bratty kids

39:57.957 --> 40:00.812
watching a rerun of your wedding day.

40:01.707 --> 40:04.314
It's not why you came here, Grace.

40:09.332 --> 40:14.025
You came here to play the
greatest role of your life:

40:15.166 --> 40:19.858
Her Serene Highness
Princess Grace of Monaco,

40:21.041 --> 40:23.040
Duchess of Valentinois,

40:23.041 --> 40:27.331
and 137 more titles
that come with it.

40:27.332 --> 40:29.939
God help you.

40:31.166 --> 40:33.772
You make it sound so easy.

40:35.499 --> 40:36.956
Look...

40:43.082 --> 40:45.456
That's a fantasy.

40:45.457 --> 40:49.356
That's a fairytale, Grace.
It's not real life.

40:49.582 --> 40:52.165
And it's not real love.

40:52.166 --> 40:56.775
Real love is... is obligation.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.858
At some point every
fairy tale must end.

41:03.207 --> 41:06.581
But you mustn't do this for
your father or for me,

41:06.582 --> 41:11.061
you must do it for yourself,
Ray and the children.

41:20.082 --> 41:22.331
<i>Kelly residence.</i>

41:22.332 --> 41:24.165
Hello, Ma.

41:24.166 --> 41:26.581
<i>Gracie?</i>

41:26.582 --> 41:28.873
<i>My goodness.</i>

41:28.874 --> 41:31.480
<i>I thought about you last week.</i>

41:32.624 --> 41:36.072
Do you remember our Labor Day
weekends at the Jersey shore?

41:37.166 --> 41:39.456
<i>Of course I do.</i>

41:39.457 --> 41:42.064
The Ocean City barbecues.

41:42.332 --> 41:44.939
Do you remember that?

41:46.041 --> 41:51.498
Wh-When Daddy tried to teach Kell-Bel
and I to spit watermelon seeds, and...

41:51.499 --> 41:54.438
And I managed to spit
farther than Kell-Bel did.

41:56.291 --> 41:59.395
<i>Your father hated Ocean City, dear.</i>

42:00.749 --> 42:03.040
<i>Are you all right?</i>

42:03.041 --> 42:05.623
<i>I've been reading some worrying news.</i>

42:05.624 --> 42:07.373
Did you get my letters?

42:07.374 --> 42:10.989
<i>Of course. I've been telling
everybody your stories.</i>

42:12.499 --> 42:15.189
<i>Did you really meet General Franco?</i>

42:16.249 --> 42:18.623
Why didn't you write back?

42:18.624 --> 42:21.859
<i>What would I have to tell
the Princess of Monaco?</i>

42:24.541 --> 42:28.404
<i>You're not seriously thinking
about coming back, are you?</i>

42:29.624 --> 42:31.873
<i>Gracie?</i>

42:31.874 --> 42:35.405
<i>You know what your father
would have said about this.</i>

42:35.624 --> 42:37.748
<i>Hollywood?</i>

42:37.749 --> 42:40.486
<i>You're not an actress
any more, Gracie.</i>

42:40.999 --> 42:43.605
<i>He'd be spinning in his grave.</i>

42:45.416 --> 42:49.030
I was just hoping we could
have a normal conversation.

42:51.291 --> 42:53.498
<i>Gracie, dear,
you're a Philadelphia girl</i>

42:53.499 --> 42:57.165
<i>who did far better than any girl from
Philadelphia could ever dream of.</i>

42:57.166 --> 42:59.139
<i>And I think...</i>

43:09.749 --> 43:12.522
Mommy, why are you crying?

43:15.041 --> 43:18.655
Cos speaking with my mother
makes me happy, silly.

43:25.541 --> 43:26.790
See you next week.

43:26.791 --> 43:29.361
- Thank you, Father Tucker.
- Thank you.

43:51.791 --> 43:55.623
Oh, my goodness, Madame,
in my humble home.

43:55.624 --> 43:58.942
Count Fernando D'Aillieres,
at your service.

43:59.249 --> 44:01.855
A marriage in crisis...

44:01.957 --> 44:06.531
A princess far away from
home faces challenges

44:06.832 --> 44:09.956
that are usually
impossible to overcome.

44:09.957 --> 44:12.248
Well, that's very reassuring, Count.

44:12.249 --> 44:16.609
I'm a protocol expert,
not a marriage counsellor.

44:16.749 --> 44:22.271
But my duty is first and
foremost to Monaco.

44:23.166 --> 44:24.290
Well, the um...

44:24.291 --> 44:27.194
the customs, the history,
the protocol...

44:27.791 --> 44:29.081
I want to know it all.

44:29.082 --> 44:31.873
You mean you're not
familiar with them already?

44:31.874 --> 44:35.322
Nobody gave me a handbook
when I got married, Count.

44:37.207 --> 44:40.063
It's not just a question
of knowing it. I...

44:40.166 --> 44:41.956
Well, really, I want to become it.

44:41.957 --> 44:43.651
Ah...

44:44.957 --> 44:47.415
Count, public opinion is
completely against me.

44:47.416 --> 44:49.915
The people of Monaco don't
see me as their Princess.

44:49.916 --> 44:53.456
I made a commitment with the whole world
watching, and for the sake of my children,

44:53.457 --> 44:56.064
I will not be called a failure.

44:57.166 --> 44:59.373
He's raised wire across
the entire border,

44:59.374 --> 45:01.831
his warships are stationed
on the edge of our waters

45:01.832 --> 45:03.998
and we've been cut off
from Nice airport.

45:03.999 --> 45:08.313
We have perhaps two months before
we run out of essential supplies.

45:08.791 --> 45:11.397
De Gaulle's running down the clock.

45:12.666 --> 45:14.123
Do you think he'll invade?

45:14.124 --> 45:15.623
By October.

45:15.624 --> 45:17.623
Which means...

45:17.624 --> 45:21.772
Whatever we have up our sleeve,
we'd better pull it out fast.

45:41.457 --> 45:42.956
Where have you been?

45:42.957 --> 45:45.915
The Vatican is hounding
me over this crisis.

45:45.916 --> 45:49.897
I've had to reassure His Holiness
that you are still in control.

45:52.249 --> 45:54.248
How's Grace?

45:54.249 --> 45:56.623
Why don't you call on her, Ray?

45:56.624 --> 45:59.230
I wouldn't know what to say.

45:59.249 --> 46:01.855
I feel awful, Francis.

46:03.332 --> 46:07.331
Well, if it wasn't for this Hollywood
nonsense, we wouldn't be in this mess.

46:07.332 --> 46:09.665
Ray, come along,
just talk to the woman.

46:09.666 --> 46:12.040
You're nothing but silent and angry.

46:12.041 --> 46:15.248
I don't know how... I don't
know how to speak to her!

46:15.249 --> 46:17.665
You know I've never been
good at this sort of thing.

46:17.666 --> 46:19.331
She's your wife.

46:19.332 --> 46:21.939
Well, that was your idea.

46:23.666 --> 46:26.248
You vetted her. I needed a Princess.

46:26.249 --> 46:27.873
She gave up her way of life for you.

46:27.874 --> 46:31.654
- Whose side are you on, Francis?
- There are no sides, Ray.

46:39.457 --> 46:42.498
Now, there's the protocol office,

46:42.499 --> 46:43.748
the chamberlain,

46:43.749 --> 46:45.581
the aide-de-camp

46:45.582 --> 46:48.915
and of course your
lady-in-waiting, Madge,

46:48.916 --> 46:50.706
the Prince's inner circle.

46:50.707 --> 46:55.373
Now, you must know exactly where
to place each of these individuals

46:55.374 --> 46:57.790
in the pecking order

46:57.791 --> 47:04.831
because almost every single one of them
makes a profession to flatter and deceive.

47:04.832 --> 47:06.456
So, how will I know who to trust?

47:06.457 --> 47:07.665
You won't.

47:07.666 --> 47:11.040
You're the Princess in
Europe's oldest court,

47:11.041 --> 47:16.990
the target of all those hidden agendas
that come with such a privilege.

47:17.791 --> 47:20.694
It's another role for you to play.

47:29.624 --> 47:32.081
Thank you.

47:32.082 --> 47:33.915
<i>For almost a thousand years,</i>

47:33.916 --> 47:37.415
<i>Monaco has stood as a
symbol of personal liberty.</i>

47:37.416 --> 47:41.748
<i>The House of Grimaldi has been
responsible for protecting that ideal.</i>

47:41.749 --> 47:44.081
<i>Since 1297.</i>

47:44.082 --> 47:45.956
<i>Francesco Grimaldi...</i>

47:45.957 --> 47:48.873
<i>Known as "Il Malizia",
"The Cunning One".</i>

47:48.874 --> 47:50.956
<i>Very good.</i>

47:50.957 --> 47:54.665
<i>...and his men captured the fortress
protecting the Rock of Monaco</i>

47:54.666 --> 47:57.652
<i>while disguised as Franciscan monks.</i>

47:58.499 --> 48:02.896
<i>Louis XIV tried to take
Monaco, but failed.</i>

48:03.041 --> 48:06.145
<i>French Revolutionary
forces actually succeeded,</i>

48:07.374 --> 48:11.853
but only until 1814,
when Napoleon was driven out.

48:12.332 --> 48:20.320
Monaco, protected by the oldest of
weapons, guile and determination.

48:20.541 --> 48:22.540
- Good boy.
- Now, you.

48:22.541 --> 48:24.567
Me?

48:30.707 --> 48:34.155
Mademoiselle Paget, French professor,

48:34.624 --> 48:38.605
et Madame Leclerk,
your movement teacher.

48:41.332 --> 48:43.939
Bonjour.

48:44.624 --> 48:46.290
The red dress...

48:46.291 --> 48:48.748
Rosalie's red dress is ravishing.

48:48.749 --> 48:51.290
Your Highness, you have
to be careful with your "R".

48:51.291 --> 48:53.415
It's at the back of the tongue.

48:53.416 --> 48:54.831
Rrr... Rrrrah!

48:54.832 --> 48:56.563
- Rrrah!
- Go.

49:00.457 --> 49:03.081
- ...Est ravissante!
- Ravissante!

49:03.082 --> 49:04.790
Ravissante!

49:04.791 --> 49:07.373
Pompeux. Be careful: pompeux.

49:07.374 --> 49:08.456
Pompeux.

49:08.457 --> 49:12.123
- Le pas Pompeux.
- Le pas Pompeux.

49:12.124 --> 49:16.206
<i>The thrill of this moment keeps me
from saying what I really feel.</i>

49:16.207 --> 49:18.790
You see, you look like
a nervous schoolgirl.

49:18.791 --> 49:22.415
When you move, you expend
energy, you lose control.

49:22.416 --> 49:23.706
You must centre.

49:23.707 --> 49:25.415
Let me show you.

49:25.416 --> 49:27.373
You centre, here.

49:27.374 --> 49:30.857
Economy of breath. Serenity.

49:36.832 --> 49:41.110
The Germans say they'll only attend
the dinner if the Italians do.

49:41.749 --> 49:43.123
Get Fanfani on the line.

49:43.124 --> 49:45.612
What? Now? I've got London.

49:45.749 --> 49:48.355
- OK.
- Pad re, from America.

49:49.207 --> 49:51.956
Mr Allan, can we invite
people during the blockade?

49:51.957 --> 49:56.650
Sure. Hey, de Gaulle can't stop foreign
envoys from entering the country.

49:59.707 --> 50:02.165
<i>You've been a father
figure to both of them.</i>

50:02.166 --> 50:05.081
<i>Which is why they must
not find out I have to leave,</i>

50:05.082 --> 50:07.081
<i>especially at such a time.</i>

50:07.082 --> 50:08.956
Onassis has persuaded the Prince

50:08.957 --> 50:12.706
to host a state reception for our
European neighbours next month.

50:12.707 --> 50:17.815
He plans to make a case for
military support against de Gaulle.

50:17.874 --> 50:19.873
And she needs to be ready by then.

50:19.874 --> 50:23.290
This isn't just about a
marriage, is it, Father?

50:23.291 --> 50:25.165
Well, I'm afraid it is.

50:25.166 --> 50:28.946
Without their union,
Monaco is finished.

50:29.957 --> 50:32.498
How is she doing, Fernando?

50:32.499 --> 50:35.290
She lacks confidence.

50:35.291 --> 50:37.873
She sells seashells
by the sea shore...

50:37.874 --> 50:39.956
Again!

50:43.199 --> 50:45.040
So difficult!

50:45.041 --> 50:47.665
- Oh!
- Please...

50:47.666 --> 50:49.290
Try again, Madame.

50:52.457 --> 50:54.040
Courage.

50:54.041 --> 50:56.611
Anger.

50:59.291 --> 51:01.566
Good.

51:25.291 --> 51:29.688
- May I help you, Madam?
- Your Highness!

52:51.624 --> 52:54.148
<i>I need to see you right away.</i>

52:54.207 --> 52:56.731
<i>I think she's onto me.</i>

52:56.749 --> 52:58.831
<i>Yes, but I can't come to you.</i>

52:58.832 --> 53:02.897
<i>I can't leave here,
they'll know something's going on.</i>

53:04.957 --> 53:07.481
Phyllis, how do I look?

53:07.541 --> 53:10.065
Great. You look great.

53:40.374 --> 53:42.815
What does she want?

53:44.749 --> 53:46.526
Hello.

53:46.957 --> 53:48.734
- Your Highness.
- Princess.

53:50.916 --> 53:53.873
Would you like a little
something to eat?

53:53.874 --> 53:57.915
<i>Never before have
journalists seen a princess</i>

53:57.916 --> 54:01.415
<i>breach the protocol imposed
on persons of her station.</i>

54:01.416 --> 54:04.956
<i>Unless it's a new
American-style publicity stunt.</i>

54:04.957 --> 54:07.290
<i>Is it a dress rehearsal
for Hollywood?</i>

54:07.291 --> 54:10.540
<i>Is she practicing a
scene for Hitchcock?</i>

54:10.541 --> 54:12.531
<i>So many questions...</i>

54:12.874 --> 54:14.706
What does she think she's doing?

54:14.707 --> 54:16.790
If we can get the media on our side,

54:16.791 --> 54:19.123
we can turn public opinion
against the French.

54:19.124 --> 54:21.915
De Gaulle doesn't give a
shit about public opinion.

54:21.916 --> 54:25.151
But he does care about
what the Americans think.

54:34.916 --> 54:37.831
Hello, sir. Your papers.

54:37.832 --> 54:40.581
<i>I'll arrange for you to
cross the western border.</i>

54:40.582 --> 54:42.331
Go ahead, sir.

54:42.332 --> 54:45.706
<i>The road passes through a pine-forest.
I'll meet you by the small cross.</i>

54:45.707 --> 54:47.415
<i>You'll have to pay more.</i>

54:47.416 --> 54:49.706
<i>Any idea who you're speaking to?</i>

54:49.707 --> 54:52.112
<i>Money is not a problem.</i>

54:52.124 --> 54:55.415
She's meeting with a
French private detective.

54:55.416 --> 54:57.940
She's working for someone.

55:00.457 --> 55:02.981
Do what you need to do.

56:16.232 --> 56:19.150
I think we have some talking to do.

56:31.541 --> 56:33.614
Tuck?

56:33.957 --> 56:35.900
Tuck?

56:36.332 --> 56:38.275
Tuck?

56:59.207 --> 57:02.987
You really shouldn't be reading
my private mail, Gracie.

57:07.499 --> 57:10.023
Who is that from?

57:12.749 --> 57:14.581
Who is it from?

57:14.582 --> 57:18.197
Six years ago,
I promised you a new home.

57:19.791 --> 57:22.315
And I've done what I set out to do.

57:22.749 --> 57:26.150
I've asked the Vatican for
a new post in the States.

57:27.332 --> 57:29.524
I'm going home.

57:36.332 --> 57:37.956
And you're just...

57:37.957 --> 57:41.903
You were just going to leave?
You weren't gonna tell me?

57:42.207 --> 57:45.040
Ray doesn't need me any more.
Neither do you.

57:45.041 --> 57:46.983
I do need you.

57:48.416 --> 57:50.940
I'll always need you.

57:52.291 --> 57:55.692
Madge is betraying us.
She's working for someone.

57:56.374 --> 57:58.898
I don't know who else is involved.

57:59.249 --> 58:01.290
You can't leave me.

58:01.291 --> 58:03.373
I'm a bad priest here, Gracie.

58:06.207 --> 58:10.165
Maybe I can be a good priest now but
at least I'll be home where I belong.

58:10.166 --> 58:13.873
- And you belong here.
- I can't do this without you.

58:13.874 --> 58:17.790
If your family is to survive, you need
to give them an ideal they can protect.

58:17.791 --> 58:20.231
And you need to do it alone.

58:40.166 --> 58:43.816
Dear God, we thank you
for the food before us.

58:44.082 --> 58:49.206
We thank you for the family beside us,
we thank you for the love among us.

58:49.207 --> 58:51.447
<i>Amen.</i>

59:54.999 --> 59:57.523
How have you been?

59:58.499 --> 01:00:00.490
Busy.

01:00:01.291 --> 01:00:03.233
You?

01:00:03.332 --> 01:00:05.358
Busy.

01:00:07.207 --> 01:00:10.581
I suppose that's what happens
when you live in a big palace.

01:00:10.582 --> 01:00:13.106
Yes, one can get lost for days.

01:00:31.957 --> 01:00:34.149
Well...

01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:36.862
Shall we?

01:00:48.374 --> 01:00:50.498
<i>At the state dinner,</i>

01:00:50.499 --> 01:00:53.023
<i>Ray will need you by his side.</i>

01:00:53.374 --> 01:00:57.771
<i>If Madge is betraying us,
she will not be acting alone.</i>

01:01:34.207 --> 01:01:36.068
My family...

01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:39.498
my country, has known conflict.

01:01:39.499 --> 01:01:41.373
And we've chosen to reject it

01:01:41.374 --> 01:01:44.905
because that is not the
future of Europe, gentlemen.

01:01:45.374 --> 01:01:50.529
The future is... business,
for the sake of business.

01:01:51.624 --> 01:01:53.581
Not for the sake of government

01:01:53.582 --> 01:01:56.983
and certainly not for the
sake of de Gaulle's empire.

01:01:59.624 --> 01:02:02.148
If you value your liberty,

01:02:02.374 --> 01:02:04.980
then you too should understand that.

01:02:05.249 --> 01:02:13.485
All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is
for men of conscience to remain silent.

01:02:14.999 --> 01:02:17.165
If de Gaulle is giving
me the choice...

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:21.998
What she wants is impossible!
And what's more it's dangerous for Italy!

01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:23.873
Please wait, please...

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:27.456
Defending Monaco means
declaring war on France.

01:02:27.457 --> 01:02:29.981
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.

01:02:36.874 --> 01:02:39.665
Bad news. Somebody just
tried to kill De Gaulle.

01:02:39.666 --> 01:02:41.706
Oh, my goodness! What happened?

01:02:41.707 --> 01:02:44.915
French right wing is claiming
responsibility over Algeria.

01:02:44.916 --> 01:02:47.456
It's going to be impossible
for Ray to get any support.

01:02:47.457 --> 01:02:50.444
Now, nobody in Europe
will cross de Gaulle.

01:03:02.666 --> 01:03:05.521
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
please calm down.

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:16.248
- Ari?
- What?

01:03:16.249 --> 01:03:18.873
- We're done for.
- What are you talking about?

01:03:18.874 --> 01:03:21.196
What happened?

01:03:28.874 --> 01:03:30.498
It's over, Grace.

01:03:30.499 --> 01:03:33.023
Louis XIV failed to take Monaco,

01:03:33.332 --> 01:03:37.165
Napoleon failed to take Monaco,
de Gaulle will fail to take Monaco,

01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:39.290
no matter what happens here tonight.

01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:42.739
Stop drinking, you need to
keep your wits about you.

01:03:44.874 --> 01:03:48.331
- So you're going to support us?
- That's not quite clear yet.

01:03:48.332 --> 01:03:51.947
You have to make it clearer.
We have to decide tonight.

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:58.190
No one will help us.

01:03:58.332 --> 01:04:00.498
If only Rainier wasn't so pig-headed.

01:04:00.499 --> 01:04:02.540
What choice does he have?

01:04:02.541 --> 01:04:04.581
Give de Gaulle what he wants.

01:04:04.582 --> 01:04:08.665
I can bring de Gaulle to the negotiating
table. He's not that unreasonable.

01:04:08.666 --> 01:04:10.498
But Rainier won't listen to me.

01:04:10.499 --> 01:04:12.040
Maybe...

01:04:12.041 --> 01:04:14.290
Maybe you can talk
some sense into him?

01:04:14.291 --> 01:04:16.815
Before we lose everything!

01:04:24.124 --> 01:04:26.165
You've done very well tonight, dear.

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:28.581
Now Robert wants you
to meet a few people.

01:04:28.582 --> 01:04:31.106
Everyone is anxious to meet you.

01:05:07.041 --> 01:05:08.652
What?

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:17.481
What is that?

01:05:18.041 --> 01:05:19.948
Madge?

01:05:21.249 --> 01:05:23.275
Grace?

01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:27.239
Grace?

01:05:41.082 --> 01:05:43.274
What is this?

01:05:45.249 --> 01:05:48.981
Did you tell Antoinette to
meet with de Gaulle's people?

01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:15.415
Where did you get these?

01:06:15.416 --> 01:06:17.904
Madge hired a detective.

01:06:18.916 --> 01:06:22.530
Your sister made a deal with
France to deliver Monaco.

01:06:22.832 --> 01:06:25.356
In return for taking the throne.

01:06:30.207 --> 01:06:32.233
Leave us, please.

01:06:45.582 --> 01:06:48.106
You want me to accuse my sister?

01:06:49.332 --> 01:06:51.856
They're trying to topple you, Ray.

01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:02.145
Her son is next in line.
That makes her regent.

01:07:08.916 --> 01:07:11.440
My own sister.

01:07:17.999 --> 01:07:20.523
Why are you still here, Grace?

01:07:23.041 --> 01:07:25.565
Because we have children together.

01:07:28.166 --> 01:07:30.690
Because I still love you.

01:07:32.624 --> 01:07:36.025
And I refuse to let somebody
take my family from me.

01:07:47.499 --> 01:07:50.023
So what happened tonight?

01:07:52.707 --> 01:07:54.290
They all walked out.

01:07:54.291 --> 01:07:58.154
The assassination attempt has
stopped the whole process.

01:07:58.666 --> 01:08:01.790
And when de Gaulle rolls his
tanks through Monte Carlo,

01:08:01.791 --> 01:08:04.445
we'll have lost everything to France.

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:07.608
Oh, Ray.

01:08:12.041 --> 01:08:14.565
I don't know what to do, Grace.

01:08:24.291 --> 01:08:25.872
I'm your wife...

01:08:25.874 --> 01:08:28.398
for richer or poorer.

01:08:28.791 --> 01:08:30.122
So...

01:08:30.124 --> 01:08:33.622
what's the worst that can happen...
we lose a stupid old throne?

01:08:33.624 --> 01:08:35.863
Who cares?

01:08:36.791 --> 01:08:39.564
We buy a nice farmhouse
in Montpellier.

01:08:40.874 --> 01:08:43.196
We watch each other grow old.

01:08:45.791 --> 01:08:48.314
Hand in hand.

01:08:56.791 --> 01:09:00.819
This... This wasn't
what I wanted for you.

01:09:01.541 --> 01:09:03.122
Grace, I...

01:09:03.124 --> 01:09:06.359
- I know.
- I never meant for you to be unhappy.

01:09:07.374 --> 01:09:09.317
I know.

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:04.373
Hello?

01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:06.898
<i>Hitch? It's me.</i>

01:10:08.082 --> 01:10:10.123
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

01:10:10.124 --> 01:10:11.456
No.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:13.318
Oh.

01:10:14.249 --> 01:10:16.773
I've reached my decision. I've...

01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:20.565
I've thought about it and...

01:10:22.332 --> 01:10:25.733
you'll have to find somebody
else to do the role.

01:10:26.541 --> 01:10:28.581
Is everything all right, Gracie?

01:10:28.582 --> 01:10:30.573
<i>Yes.</i>

01:10:30.707 --> 01:10:32.982
<i>Yes, everything's fine.</i>

01:10:35.249 --> 01:10:37.489
I'm sorry.

01:10:38.541 --> 01:10:40.123
And...

01:10:40.124 --> 01:10:42.165
good luck.

01:10:42.166 --> 01:10:44.690
<i>Just remember, darling...</i>

01:10:45.749 --> 01:10:49.730
don't stand too close
to the edge of frame.

01:10:50.374 --> 01:10:52.649
Thank you, Hitch.

01:11:25.624 --> 01:11:28.148
Tuck's gone.

01:11:30.082 --> 01:11:32.108
I know.

01:11:33.374 --> 01:11:35.898
If I had a solution to our problem...

01:11:37.374 --> 01:11:39.415
Would you let me try something?

01:11:39.416 --> 01:11:41.525
Like what?

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:45.690
Will you let me try something?

01:11:53.291 --> 01:11:56.359
We can't let her think
we're at her beck and call.

01:11:58.999 --> 01:12:01.248
Hello, ladies!

01:12:01.249 --> 01:12:04.665
Thanks for coming on short notice.

01:12:04.666 --> 01:12:07.439
So sorry to trouble you.

01:12:08.249 --> 01:12:11.790
Our country needs you,
and there's no time to waste.

01:12:11.791 --> 01:12:13.206
Yes, but why?

01:12:13.207 --> 01:12:16.456
We need to get the ball
back on track for October.

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:18.206
Oh, le bal!

01:12:18.207 --> 01:12:20.945
I am a princess after all,
n'est-ce pas?

01:12:21.249 --> 01:12:24.748
You think we can throw a party
a few days from an invasion?

01:12:24.749 --> 01:12:26.123
Come on!

01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:27.936
Start shooting!

01:12:31.707 --> 01:12:34.231
Where are you going?

01:12:37.499 --> 01:12:39.857
To Paris.

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:42.998
Londres...

01:12:42.999 --> 01:12:45.040
Lisbonne... Madrid...

01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:47.081
Vienne... Copenhague...

01:12:47.082 --> 01:12:48.873
Amsterdam...

01:12:48.874 --> 01:12:50.915
Oslo... Washington...

01:12:50.916 --> 01:12:52.956
La Valette... Saint-Marin...

01:12:52.957 --> 01:12:55.197
Paris...

01:13:03.791 --> 01:13:05.831
Please, stand aside.

01:13:05.832 --> 01:13:07.873
- Stand aside.
- Everybody, leave room.

01:13:07.874 --> 01:13:10.232
Grace Kelly!

01:13:10.999 --> 01:13:13.653
Photo, please, Miss Kelly, over here!

01:13:15.499 --> 01:13:17.248
There's Grace Kelly!

01:13:17.249 --> 01:13:18.831
What about Marnie?

01:13:18.832 --> 01:13:20.373
When does the shoot begin?

01:13:20.374 --> 01:13:25.232
I spoke to Mr Alfred Hitchcock a few days
ago and I informed him of my decision.

01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:28.915
I will not be returning to Hollywood.

01:13:28.916 --> 01:13:30.123
Why?

01:13:30.124 --> 01:13:33.290
I left Grace Kelly behind
when I married Prince Rainier

01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:35.649
and that has not changed.

01:13:35.957 --> 01:13:40.946
Now, I will hopefully be
focusing on my family

01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:43.331
and my humanitarian work.

01:13:43.332 --> 01:13:45.248
This is Countess Baciochi.

01:13:45.249 --> 01:13:49.906
She has an announcement that she
would like you to listen to very closely.

01:13:50.666 --> 01:13:52.748
I'm pleased to announce
that on 9th October,

01:13:52.749 --> 01:13:54.665
the Prince's Palace of Monaco

01:13:54.666 --> 01:13:57.915
will host the Annual Ball for
the International Red Cross.

01:13:57.916 --> 01:14:01.290
- Who's going to attend?
- Everybody, I hope.

01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:03.447
Has President de Gaulle been invited?

01:14:14.124 --> 01:14:16.115
What is this invitation?

01:14:18.291 --> 01:14:20.831
All of Europe has turned
their back on him.

01:14:20.832 --> 01:14:22.831
- Thank you so much.
- Your Highness...

01:14:22.832 --> 01:14:23.956
Au revoir.

01:14:23.957 --> 01:14:26.149
Turned their back on Rainier...

01:14:27.874 --> 01:14:30.279
Not Grace.

01:14:34.707 --> 01:14:37.231
The Princess needs to see you.

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:48.774
Grace?

01:14:49.082 --> 01:14:51.441
Family is all that matters?

01:14:53.791 --> 01:14:57.939
So what did de Gaulle promise you
to sell out yours, Jean-Charles?

01:14:59.707 --> 01:15:01.733
Was it money?

01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:04.400
The throne?

01:15:05.541 --> 01:15:07.581
That's preposterous, Grace.

01:15:07.582 --> 01:15:10.106
"Altesse" when you address me.

01:15:10.999 --> 01:15:13.523
Where's my brother?

01:15:16.707 --> 01:15:19.498
Ray, this is a terrible
misunderstanding.

01:15:19.499 --> 01:15:21.655
Then tell me it isn't true.

01:15:26.041 --> 01:15:27.983
Ray...

01:15:29.166 --> 01:15:31.690
This is not what it seems.

01:15:31.874 --> 01:15:35.322
- I just...
- You just what? Hm?

01:15:39.207 --> 01:15:42.608
You are to leave Monaco
and you are never to return.

01:15:45.332 --> 01:15:47.856
You can't banish me.

01:15:50.249 --> 01:15:51.831
Rainier?

01:15:51.832 --> 01:15:54.206
- It was decided...
- I will not!

01:15:54.207 --> 01:15:57.904
She will not tell me what to do!

01:15:58.124 --> 01:16:00.695
It was decided by
council this morning.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:16.235
And how long do you think
that you're going to last here?

01:16:17.916 --> 01:16:20.440
Long enough to see the back of you.

01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:26.873
But before you go, you will
perform one final act of state.

01:16:26.874 --> 01:16:28.915
And why would I do that?

01:16:28.916 --> 01:16:30.790
Because if you do,

01:16:30.791 --> 01:16:34.405
I will make sure that your
son is taken care of.

01:16:42.791 --> 01:16:44.915
<i>Are you absolutely sure?</i>

01:16:44.916 --> 01:16:48.115
The Red Cross means a
lot to her, Mr President.

01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:51.064
She's keeping herself
busy, that's all.

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:53.814
<i>Do we have Rainier
where we want him?</i>

01:16:54.666 --> 01:16:57.948
Oh, he's just about ready
to agree to anything...

01:16:58.124 --> 01:17:00.956
including handing over
Monaco's sovereignty.

01:17:00.957 --> 01:17:05.498
<i>Good. Your loyalty to France won't
go without reward, Jean-Charles.</i>

01:17:05.499 --> 01:17:08.402
Thank you, Mr President.

01:17:15.082 --> 01:17:18.040
Shouldn't we shun this ball?

01:17:18.041 --> 01:17:22.081
If America supports Monaco,
things will get complicated.

01:17:22.082 --> 01:17:26.331
I've survived an assassination attack.
I'm not afraid of an actress.

01:17:26.332 --> 01:17:28.081
Pelletier,

01:17:28.082 --> 01:17:30.831
call Rainier and tell him that...

01:17:30.832 --> 01:17:33.652
I accept his invitation.

01:18:17.582 --> 01:18:20.540
Kennedy has sent his
defense minister, General.

01:18:20.541 --> 01:18:22.271
McNamara's here!

01:18:22.666 --> 01:18:25.081
Mr McNamara! This way,
sir, for the Chronicle!

01:18:28.624 --> 01:18:30.456
Mr McNamara?

01:18:30.457 --> 01:18:32.946
Sir, one for the camera?

01:18:39.457 --> 01:18:42.396
- I wanna take a picture too.
- Now, hold on.

01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:47.206
Let me through, here, let me through.

01:18:47.207 --> 01:18:49.861
Highness, picture over here, please.

01:19:10.499 --> 01:19:12.485
Grace, Grace?

01:19:21.707 --> 01:19:25.155
Your Highness. Thank you, thank you!

01:19:25.332 --> 01:19:27.607
- Princess.
- Princess.

01:19:42.999 --> 01:19:45.523
We love you, Princess!

01:19:49.666 --> 01:19:52.190
Stand round here, please, Grace.

Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome
your host for this evening,

01:23:26.249 --> 01:23:30.148
the President of the
Monegasque Red Cross,

01:23:30.249 --> 01:23:34.230
Her Serene Highness,
Princess Grace of Monaco.

01:24:15.124 --> 01:24:17.665
We are truly touched that
you would all honour

01:24:17.666 --> 01:24:20.948
our tiny corner of the
world with your presence.

01:24:24.249 --> 01:24:25.998
Goodness, we've, well...

01:24:25.999 --> 01:24:27.915
We've had a spot of trouble lately.

01:24:35.332 --> 01:24:38.105
When I was acting in New York,

01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:44.489
my uncle, a wonderful playwright,
told me that I should pray.

01:24:45.082 --> 01:24:47.040
The same prayer, every night.

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:51.733
That should I ever... should I ever
make it, I would never be ungrateful.

01:24:52.374 --> 01:24:55.165
That should I ever be in
a position of influence,

01:24:55.166 --> 01:24:57.772
I would have it in me
to use it for good.

01:24:58.874 --> 01:25:01.647
Now, some of you ask,
why did I leave Hollywood?

01:25:02.332 --> 01:25:04.939
Well... I left because...

01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:08.645
because I fell in love
with a charming prince.

01:25:09.374 --> 01:25:16.040
A man who has inspired me to see
the world with enough compassion

01:25:16.041 --> 01:25:20.568
that I may want to do something about
all of the unfair things that I see in it.

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:24.363
And that is why we are
honouring the Red Cross.

01:25:24.874 --> 01:25:29.650
A force for good that is...
that is very close to my heart.

01:25:34.291 --> 01:25:38.106
One of my dearest
friends once told me...

01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:42.623
"that when people dream
of marrying royalty,

01:25:42.624 --> 01:25:45.906
they rarely comprehend
what it actually means.

01:25:49.707 --> 01:25:51.780
It means...

01:25:53.457 --> 01:25:55.956
It means having to choose.

01:25:55.957 --> 01:25:59.856
And... I chose the House of Monaco.

01:26:02.582 --> 01:26:05.569
It may not seem a noble
place, it may seem...

01:26:06.624 --> 01:26:10.498
Well, it may seem pompous and
it may seem circumstantial,

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:14.647
and... I may not speak
its language and...

01:26:15.291 --> 01:26:16.815
Oh...

01:26:19.082 --> 01:26:22.186
It frustrates me at times, but...

01:26:24.457 --> 01:26:26.290
it's my home.

01:26:26.291 --> 01:26:29.831
And these are my people.
And they are good people.

01:26:29.832 --> 01:26:34.821
And they're trying to do what's right,
in their own small corner of the world...

01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:38.481
in the best way that they know how.

01:26:40.582 --> 01:26:44.564
And those of you who are married
will know exactly what I mean.

01:26:45.749 --> 01:26:50.774
Maybe I'm naive but...
I believe in fairy tales.

01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:55.165
I do. I believe that they can
exist if we really want them to,

01:26:55.166 --> 01:26:59.645
if we are prepared
to work hard enough.

01:27:00.749 --> 01:27:02.206
I believe that the...

01:27:02.207 --> 01:27:08.156
that the world will not always
be full of hatred and conflict if...

01:27:12.374 --> 01:27:15.147
if we're willing to sacrifice enough.

01:27:16.457 --> 01:27:18.123
And that is what...

01:27:18.124 --> 01:27:20.648
That is what Monaco means to me.

01:27:21.082 --> 01:27:23.606
And in a way that is why...

01:27:24.582 --> 01:27:27.106
That is why I am Monaco.

01:27:29.457 --> 01:27:31.981
I have no army, I...

01:27:33.666 --> 01:27:36.190
I wish ill on no one.

01:27:38.582 --> 01:27:41.686
I bear no resistance to
aggression, I just...

01:27:43.916 --> 01:27:45.956
I'm here.

01:27:47.999 --> 01:27:49.873
I'm here doing what I do,

01:27:49.874 --> 01:27:54.732
trying to make a little difference in the
world in the best way that I know how.

01:27:58.374 --> 01:28:01.540
But it wouldn't be real life,
or it wouldn't be the fairy tale,

01:28:01.541 --> 01:28:04.831
if there wasn't someone trying
to destroy it, or crush it,

01:28:04.832 --> 01:28:08.415
simply because it doesn't please them,
or simply because they can.

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:11.864
And I know some of you think
it's their right to do so.

01:28:12.416 --> 01:28:14.540
But I don't think anyone
should have the right

01:28:14.541 --> 01:28:17.645
to crush happiness or
beauty when they see it.

01:28:20.041 --> 01:28:21.498
Well, it's...

01:28:21.499 --> 01:28:23.540
It's not how I was raised.

01:28:23.541 --> 01:28:26.195
And it's not the world
that I wish to...

01:28:26.582 --> 01:28:29.236
It's not the world I
wish to be a part of.

01:28:30.374 --> 01:28:34.248
I would rather that the...
that the tanks roll through my lawn,

01:28:34.249 --> 01:28:36.831
I would rather that the
bombs fall on my house

01:28:36.832 --> 01:28:39.915
than know I live in a world
where love doesn't conquer all.

01:28:39.916 --> 01:28:41.693
Because...

01:28:42.749 --> 01:28:45.273
Because I believe in love.

01:28:46.082 --> 01:28:50.581
And... I believe that it's love
that has brought us here tonight.

01:28:50.582 --> 01:28:52.774
And it's love...

01:28:53.666 --> 01:28:57.456
It's love that will make us put
away our guns and our politics

01:28:57.457 --> 01:28:59.498
and our fears and our prejudices,

01:28:59.499 --> 01:29:03.943
and it's love that will
eventually make everything right.

01:29:04.957 --> 01:29:08.275
And that is why tonight I
am going to celebrate it,

01:29:09.124 --> 01:29:11.778
and I'm going to be
willing to defend it.

01:29:13.374 --> 01:29:17.024
And I hope that you will all do
the same in your own way...

01:29:19.999 --> 01:29:22.523
out there in your own lives.

01:30:37.166 --> 01:30:40.123
American Aphrodite...

01:30:40.124 --> 01:30:44.733
You're not really gonna drop a bomb
on Princess Grace, are you, Charles?

01:30:57.957 --> 01:31:00.481
I love you.
