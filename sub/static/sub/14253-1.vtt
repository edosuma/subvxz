WEBVTT

00:03.036 --> 00:05.027
Last time
on Star Trek: Voyager...

00:05.138 --> 00:06.935
Stay the course!

00:07.007 --> 00:07.939
They're breaking through.

00:08.007 --> 00:08.838
We'll be dead

00:08.908 --> 00:10.705
if we don't get
the shields back up.

00:10.777 --> 00:11.937
Arm yourselves!

00:14.981 --> 00:15.948
Who attacked you?

00:16.082 --> 00:17.174
We don't know.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.718
We can't communicate with them.

00:19.786 --> 00:22.346
They've been attacking
us for weeks.

00:22.422 --> 00:24.947
Your crew has been running
criminal experiments here.

00:25.058 --> 00:26.958
l know.
l designed them.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.551
You?

00:28.628 --> 00:30.289
That's a violation
of your programming.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.558
They deleted
my ethical subroutines.

00:34.067 --> 00:37.366
lt's easy to cling to principles
when you're standing on a vessel

00:37.470 --> 00:38.732
with its bulkheads intact,

00:38.838 --> 00:40.772
manned by a crew
that's not starving.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.274
lt's never easy,
but, if we turn our backs

00:43.343 --> 00:45.573
on our principles,
we stop being human.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.977
l'm putting an end
to your experiments,

00:48.048 --> 00:50.710
and you are hereby relieved
of your command.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.912
l rerouted transporter control
to a panel in the next junction.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.113
We can...

01:00.460 --> 01:02.690
Bridge, they've got
the field generator.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.093
What do you mean,
they've got it?

01:04.164 --> 01:06.223
l don't know how, but
they beamed it off of Voyager.

01:06.299 --> 01:08.062
We're going home.

01:08.168 --> 01:09.601
We can't let Voyager
stop us now,

01:09.669 --> 01:13.002
not when we're this close.

01:14.741 --> 01:15.708
Shields are down.

01:15.775 --> 01:17.037
Arm yourselves.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.134
Get us out of here.

01:20.346 --> 01:23.838
And now the conclusion.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.112
Fissures are opening, all decks!

01:31.758 --> 01:32.349
Captain!

01:38.131 --> 01:40.429
Give me tactical control!

01:47.073 --> 01:48.335
Good guess.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.808
l used a deflector pulse
to reinforce the shields.

01:50.877 --> 01:51.935
lt won't hold for long.

01:52.011 --> 01:52.943
Bridge to Sick Bay.

01:53.012 --> 01:54.377
We have a medical emergency.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.379
Doctor, respond.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.380
Ensign.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.007
Casualty reports are coming in.

01:58.084 --> 01:59.244
Two dead, 13 wounded.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.116
We took heavy damage
to the engines.

02:01.187 --> 02:02.154
The Equinox?

02:02.222 --> 02:03.154
They've gone to warp.

02:03.223 --> 02:04.554
Any sign
of nucleogenic particles?

02:04.624 --> 02:05.556
No.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.557
Then they haven't engaged

02:06.626 --> 02:07.615
their enhanced warp drive yet.

02:07.694 --> 02:08.626
Keep looking for...

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.438 --> 02:19.530
Report.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.504
The shield grid
is back in place.

02:21.574 --> 02:22.700
The aliens are staying clear.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.174
Are sensors picking up Voyager?

02:24.244 --> 02:25.905
lt looks like they're
under attack.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.044
Maintain course.

04:38.578 --> 04:42.844
Captain, l found the Doctor's
mobile emitter on Deck 9.

04:42.915 --> 04:44.780
You might want
to take it to Sick Bay.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.009
Any sign of the Doc?

05:12.078 --> 05:13.340
l've got him right here.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.577
Please state
the nature of the...

05:18.651 --> 05:21.085
Don't bother.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.815
You should start with Chakotay.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.220
l've got him stabilized,

05:24.290 --> 05:25.882
but he's got
internal injuries.

05:26.025 --> 05:28.255
We found your emitter
on Deck 9.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.387
l was taken hostage
by the Equinox crew.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.829
l deactivated
myself to escape.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.230
Did you stop them?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.301
No.

05:35.368 --> 05:36.460
l'd ask
for a status report,

05:36.569 --> 05:38.059
but l'm not sure
l'd want to hear it.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.162
Harry's analyzing the
sound we've been hearing.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.434
He thinks it's some form
of communication.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.440
Well, l once figured out

05:43.509 --> 05:44.942
how to speak
with a Terrelian Seapod.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.807
This couldn't be
that much harder.

05:46.879 --> 05:49.313
Once l get out of Sick Bay,
l'll lend him a hand.

05:49.382 --> 05:50.940
We should all be
focusing our efforts

05:51.084 --> 05:52.108
on finding the Equinox.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.949
First things first- - 
we've got to stop these attacks.

05:55.054 --> 05:56.487
Our enemies aren't the aliens.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.046
They're the humans
aboard the Equinox.

05:58.124 --> 05:59.216
lt's crucial that you don't...

06:10.103 --> 06:11.570
Who is it?

06:11.671 --> 06:14.196
lt's Max.
l've brought you a visitor.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.296
Hold on.

06:16.776 --> 06:17.743
Come in.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.382
l'm glad you're okay.

06:24.450 --> 06:27.214
l've been using this
synaptic stimulator.

06:27.286 --> 06:30.653
l was just taking a stroll
along the Tenkaran Coast.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.190
You're welcome to try it.

06:32.258 --> 06:33.623
State your intentions.

06:34.727 --> 06:38.060
You know, once we get
our enhanced warp drive

06:38.131 --> 06:40.725
back on line, we'll
be on our way home.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.826
But it'll still take
months to get there.

06:43.936 --> 06:47.303
You can spend that
time in the brig, or...

06:47.373 --> 06:50.740
you can become
part of this crew.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.937
l'd prefer the latter.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.809
l'd prefer the brig.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.475
You know, Janeway's
not the only captain

06:58.551 --> 07:01.042
who can help you
explore your humanity.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.918
You would be
an inferior role model.

07:04.991 --> 07:07.152
Janeway clung to her morality

07:07.226 --> 07:09.251
at the expense of her crew.

07:09.328 --> 07:12.388
Maybe you should learn
from that mistake.

07:12.465 --> 07:15.059
Her only mistake
was trusting you.

07:18.037 --> 07:19.766
Take care of her wound.

07:34.220 --> 07:37.883
First- degree phaser burns,
minor lacerations.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.083
Looks like we'll have
to amputate.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.353
That was a joke.

07:41.427 --> 07:43.725
You're supposed to smile
and make a witty retort.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.593
l'm familiar with human banter.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.530
Yours is crude and predictable.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.591
You know, Seven- - 
can l call you Seven?

07:49.669 --> 07:51.637
We don't have
many luxuries around here.

07:51.737 --> 07:53.136
All we've got is each other.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.037
You might try letting
your shields down,

07:55.107 --> 07:56.540
or else it's going
to be a lonely trip.

07:56.609 --> 07:57.871
l'll be damned.

07:57.944 --> 08:01.380
Looks like our Doctor
left us a replacement.

08:01.447 --> 08:02.812
Seven...?

08:02.915 --> 08:05.782
We are captives.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.683
l was attacked by their EMH.

08:07.753 --> 08:10.779
Looks like he downloaded
you into our database.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.155
Good.
You can treat your friend.

08:19.365 --> 08:20.627
Priming the injectors.

08:20.700 --> 08:21.632
Marla to Bridge.

08:21.701 --> 08:22.633
Go ahead.

08:22.735 --> 08:23.633
We're ready.

08:23.736 --> 08:24.668
Acknowledged.

08:24.737 --> 08:26.364
lnfuse the enhanced warp drive

08:26.472 --> 08:28.030
with 20 isograms
of the compound.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.698
Aye, sir.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.369
Warp drive ready.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.472
Engage.

08:42.288 --> 08:43.220
What happened?

08:43.289 --> 08:44.756
Power relays are off- line.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.052
They've been encoded.

08:50.463 --> 08:51.862
Give us the codes.

08:51.931 --> 08:52.863
No.

08:52.932 --> 08:53.990
lf she won't give us the codes,

08:54.066 --> 08:55.465
maybe we could
extract them ourselves.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.900
Seven's cranial infrastructure
is highly complex.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.631
You'll need months
just to figure out

08:59.739 --> 09:00.831
what she had for breakfast.

09:00.940 --> 09:01.929
That's why you're gonna help us.

09:02.041 --> 09:02.973
l refuse.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.134
Do it or l'll erase
your program.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.142
Be my guest.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.143
Doctor.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.201
Don't worry.
They need me.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.941
They'd be cutting off
their holographic nose

09:09.015 --> 09:10.107
to spite their face.

09:10.182 --> 09:11.274
Now, l suggest you...

09:11.350 --> 09:14.080
All right, Doctor.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.120
Now, get to work.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.087
You know what we're looking for.

09:17.156 --> 09:19.317
Very well.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.518
She'll try to resist.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.060
l'll have to restrain her.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.095
Doctor.

09:23.162 --> 09:24.823
l deleted
his ethical subroutines.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.829
He'll be a little more
cooperative now.

09:26.899 --> 09:27.991
You keep me posted.

09:28.100 --> 09:28.998
Aye, Captain.

09:29.101 --> 09:30.227
This way, please.

09:37.643 --> 09:40.635
lt's not exactly Shakespeare,
but it gets the point across.

09:40.713 --> 09:42.613
A small olive branch
is still an olive branch.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.479
Run this through
your translation matrix.

09:44.550 --> 09:45.642
Set your weapons down.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.242
Commander?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.220
Somebody's got to start
trusting somebody around here.

09:49.288 --> 09:50.414
Belay that order.

09:50.489 --> 09:53.253
l appreciate your optimism,
but, in this case, weapons.

09:54.193 --> 09:55.387
Ready to transmit.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.759
Drop shields,
Bridge only.

09:57.830 --> 09:58.762
Go ahead, Harry.

10:16.549 --> 10:17.573
Raise shields.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.914
lf they understood our message,
they haven't responded.

10:26.993 --> 10:28.654
There's your response.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.491
Activate
another deflector pulse.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.526
Shields are holding
at 62 percent.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.091
That should buy us another
few minutes of peace and quiet.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.795
l suggest we make
the most of it.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.804
Focus your efforts on repairing
the warp drive.

10:40.873 --> 10:41.965
We've got to find the Equinox.

10:42.108 --> 10:43.132
lf it's all the same to you,

10:43.242 --> 10:45.005
l'd like to take another
stab at the message.

10:45.111 --> 10:46.009
lf we can reroute...

10:46.112 --> 10:47.602
They're not listening,
Chakotay.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.011
We should be tracking Ransom,

10:49.081 --> 10:50.378
not tinkering with adverbs.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.313
Want your First Officer's
advice?

10:54.387 --> 10:55.319
Allow me.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.289
Our deflector's losing power

10:58.357 --> 11:00.382
and when it fails,
we'll be defenseless.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.222
lt's Voyager we should
be worrying about,

11:02.294 --> 11:03.226
not the Equinox.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.557
You'd make
a great First Officer.

11:04.630 --> 11:05.995
lt's advice worth taking.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.898
Maybe so, but we have a crew
member trapped on that ship.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.266
ls this really about Seven,
or is it about Ransom?

11:12.371 --> 11:14.362
l don't know
what you're talking about.

11:14.473 --> 11:16.407
You've been known
to hold a grudge.

11:16.475 --> 11:19.740
This man betrayed Starfleet,
he broke the Prime Directive

11:19.812 --> 11:21.575
dishonored everything
you believe in,

11:21.647 --> 11:23.205
and threw Voyager
to the wolves.

11:23.282 --> 11:24.476
Borg, Hirogen, Malon- -

11:24.550 --> 11:26.518
we've run into our share
of bad guys.

11:26.585 --> 11:27.745
Ransom's no different.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.752
Yes, he is.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.550
You said it yourself.

11:30.623 --> 11:31.590
He's human.

11:31.657 --> 11:34.387
l don't blame you
for being angry,

11:34.460 --> 11:36.690
but you can't compromise
the safety of this ship

11:36.762 --> 11:38.320
to satisfy
some personal vendetta.

11:38.397 --> 11:40.092
l appreciate your candor.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.498
Now let me be just as blunt.

11:42.601 --> 11:45.092
You're right, l am angry.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.263
l'm damned angry.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.967
He's a Starfleet Captain

11:50.076 --> 11:52.271
and he's decided
to abandon everything

11:52.344 --> 11:53.538
this uniform stands for.

11:53.612 --> 11:54.544
He's out there right now

11:54.613 --> 11:56.240
torturing and murdering
innocent life- forms

11:56.315 --> 11:58.875
just to get home
a little quicker.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.681
l'm not going to stand for it.

12:01.754 --> 12:05.417
l'm going to hunt him down
no matter how long it takes,

12:05.491 --> 12:07.459
no matter what the cost.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.892
lf you want to call
that a vendetta,

12:10.029 --> 12:11.621
go right ahead.

12:30.783 --> 12:31.807
Why did you bring us here?

12:31.884 --> 12:34.114
This planet has
a parthogenic atmosphere.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.813
lt'll keep us
from being detected

12:35.888 --> 12:36.946
while we make repairs.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.920
We also found
a few deuterium deposits.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.390
Take an away team, Noah,

12:40.459 --> 12:42.324
and see if you can
localize the ore.

12:42.394 --> 12:43.759
You won't be protected
from the aliens.

12:43.829 --> 12:44.853
Arm yourselves with phasers.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.557
At the first sign of trouble,
we'll beam you back.

12:46.632 --> 12:47.929
Aye, sir.

12:49.568 --> 12:52.765
The ocular node's connected
to the sensory node

12:52.872 --> 12:55.773
The sensory node's connected
to the cortical node

12:55.841 --> 12:59.299
The cortical node's connected
to the reticular node...

12:59.411 --> 13:00.878
Oh, now, don't look so gloomy.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.175
There's a silver lining
to all this.

13:03.215 --> 13:06.150
Just think- - we're
finally going to see Earth.

13:06.218 --> 13:08.584
You are obviously delusional.

13:08.654 --> 13:11.020
Allow me to repair
your program.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.888
Now, why would l want you
to do that?

13:13.959 --> 13:15.893
You of all people
should understand.

13:16.028 --> 13:18.326
Being unfettered
by ethical subroutines

13:18.397 --> 13:20.627
has made me far more efficient.

13:20.699 --> 13:22.132
Status?

13:22.234 --> 13:24.293
l'm going to extract
her cortical array.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.735
lt contains an index
of her memory engrams.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.570
But once l've removed it,
her higher brain functions,

13:29.642 --> 13:34.909
language, cognitive skills
will be severely damaged.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.918
Tell me the codes.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.650
No.

13:45.724 --> 13:48.955
Janeway was right
about one thing- -

13:49.094 --> 13:51.289
you are unique.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.957
Now, it would be a shame
to lose you.

13:54.099 --> 13:56.624
Your compassion is irrelevant.

13:56.735 --> 13:59.704
You think this is easy for me?

13:59.772 --> 14:03.037
The sight of you
on that table...

14:04.476 --> 14:06.467
But you're leaving
me no choice.

14:06.545 --> 14:09.013
''No choice.''

14:09.081 --> 14:11.049
You say that frequently.

14:11.116 --> 14:14.449
You destroy life- forms
to attain your goals,

14:14.520 --> 14:17.455
then claim that they
left you no choice.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.548
Does that logic comfort you?

14:23.529 --> 14:25.019
The codes.

14:25.097 --> 14:29.591
You'll have to destroy me
to obtain them.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.914
The reticular node's connected
to the occipital node...

14:44.984 --> 14:47.282
Captain's Log, supplemental.

14:47.353 --> 14:50.288
Our warp drive's back on line,
but repeated sensor sweeps

14:50.356 --> 14:52.256
have failed
to locate the Equinox.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.857
Come in.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.524
You wanted to see me?

14:59.598 --> 15:02.761
lt's not like you to submit
recommendations in writing.

15:02.868 --> 15:05.962
The last time we spoke,
you weren't exactly receptive.

15:06.071 --> 15:09.006
l'm afraid l'm not going to be
very receptive this time either.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.440
lt's an interesting idea,
but the Ankari

15:11.510 --> 15:13.034
are 50 light- years
in the wrong direction.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.672
l understand that,
but they're the ones

15:15.748 --> 15:17.648
who introduced Ransom
to these life- forms.

15:17.716 --> 15:18.683
lt stands to reason

15:18.751 --> 15:20.685
they might be able
to communicate with them- -

15:20.753 --> 15:22.186
tell them to call off
their attacks.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.814
Our first priority
is to find Ransom.

15:28.327 --> 15:31.160
Still no sign
of nucleogenic particles?

15:31.230 --> 15:32.288
Not yet.

15:32.364 --> 15:33.854
Then he couldn't
have gotten far.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.026
Without his enhanced drive,

15:36.135 --> 15:39.036
his ship's only capable
of warp 6.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.732
l've been studying
his service record.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.775
He's had his share of run- ins
with hostile aliens.

15:44.843 --> 15:47.869
lt seems that when
he's being pursued,

15:47.947 --> 15:49.380
he tends to hide.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.246
At Epsilon lV he ran into
a Klingon bird- of- prey.

15:52.318 --> 15:55.651
Played a game of cat and mouse
for three days in a nebula

15:55.721 --> 15:57.712
before the Klingons
finally gave up.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.884
Two years later,
he eluded a Romulan warbird

16:00.960 --> 16:03.827
by taking his vessel
into the atmosphere

16:03.896 --> 16:05.830
of a gas giant.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.592
Go to Astrometrics.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.930
Start looking
for the kind of place

16:10.035 --> 16:12.299
you would hide
if your ship was damaged.

16:12.404 --> 16:13.371
Yes, ma'am.

17:03.622 --> 17:06.056
How was the beach?

17:06.125 --> 17:08.787
Do these programs
have people in them?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.761
No, just landscapes. Why?

17:10.829 --> 17:12.729
Forget it.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.561
l'm reading a vein of ore.

17:19.671 --> 17:23.367
Azimuth 1 17... 30 meters.

17:23.442 --> 17:24.739
lt could run pretty deep.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.438
We might need to use
phasers to excavate it.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.879
lt's funny, this reminds me
of McKinley Park.

17:29.982 --> 17:33.145
l used to take my sister there
when we were kids.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.685
This place looks just like it.

17:34.753 --> 17:37.313
As l recall, there was
a family of ground squirrels

17:37.389 --> 17:38.720
who lived right over there.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.884
And there was a patch
of poison ivy next to it.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.018
When l was 10, l walked
right through it

17:43.095 --> 17:45.290
and l swelled up like
a Regellian blood worm.

17:45.364 --> 17:46.296
When l get back to Earth,

17:46.365 --> 17:47.696
the first thing
l'm going to do is...

17:51.837 --> 17:53.361
Four to beam up.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.835
We're receiving
a subspace transmission.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.937
From who?

18:02.014 --> 18:02.946
l can't tell.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.539
l don't see a ship out there.

18:04.616 --> 18:05.605
Open a channel.

18:05.684 --> 18:08.812
Doctor to Equinox.
Respond.

18:08.887 --> 18:09.979
We can hear you.

18:10.055 --> 18:11.989
Voyager's found you.
They've entered orbit.

18:12.057 --> 18:15.049
They polarized their hull
to mask their approach.

18:15.127 --> 18:16.151
l believe they've already

18:16.228 --> 18:17.695
planned an ambush
on the away team.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.697
Janeway's been tracking
the Equinox...

18:21.567 --> 18:22.795
Get him back.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.232
l can't.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.429
Ransom to away team.

18:26.538 --> 18:29.769
Noah, prepare to beam back
to the ship.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.543
They're not down there.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.919
All hands to battle stations.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.619
30,000 kilometers and closing.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.285
Target their power core.

18:57.703 --> 18:58.727
Direct hit.

18:58.837 --> 18:59.804
Minor damage.

18:59.872 --> 19:00.964
Return fire.

19:03.408 --> 19:05.342
Bridge to Torres.
Status?

19:05.410 --> 19:07.810
l can't locate
their shield grid generator.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.040
Can you divert more power
to sensors?

19:10.115 --> 19:11.912
Stand by.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.975
They've damaged
our deflector, Captain.

19:14.052 --> 19:15.041
lf it goes off- line,

19:15.120 --> 19:16.781
we'll be vulnerable
to the alien attacks.

19:16.855 --> 19:17.787
Noted.

19:17.856 --> 19:19.118
Target his weapons array.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.755
We lost our phaser banks.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.558
Torpedoes full spread.

19:25.631 --> 19:26.563
lt's B'Elanna.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.725
She's trying to bypass
our security protocols.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.767
Stop her.

19:33.839 --> 19:38.208
Computer, open a com- link
to the Equinox.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.438
Workstation 33- Beta.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.604
Max, listen to me.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.409
Back for round two, BLT?

19:43.482 --> 19:45.643
This isn't one of our games.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.810
People are dying over here.

19:47.886 --> 19:49.513
l wish you didn't have
to be one of them.

19:49.588 --> 19:52.113
Max, please...

19:54.493 --> 19:55.653
Shields are weakening.

19:55.727 --> 19:56.887
We've almost got him.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.827
Keep targeting
their weapons array.

19:58.897 --> 20:00.626
One more torpedo ought to do it.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.996
Captain...

20:02.067 --> 20:03.091
Fire.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.032
Weapons are down!

20:10.142 --> 20:11.131
Janeway to Ransom.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.074
Surrender your vessel.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.238
We still have thrusters,
don't we?

20:15.314 --> 20:16.542
Aye, sir.

20:16.615 --> 20:17.946
Lay in a course

20:18.083 --> 20:20.677
through the planet's
atmosphere- -

20:20.752 --> 20:22.413
60- degree vector.

20:28.994 --> 20:30.689
What the hell is he doing?

20:30.762 --> 20:31.729
Follow him.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.964
We're crossing
the upper thermosphere.

20:38.136 --> 20:39.330
Phasers.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.478
Shields are weakening- -

20:51.550 --> 20:53.313
31 percent...

20:53.385 --> 20:54.545
29...

20:55.687 --> 20:58.121
lnertial dampers are off- line.

20:58.190 --> 21:02.183
Captain, if we lose our shields,
we'll be attacked by the aliens.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.621
Captain!

21:05.697 --> 21:07.665
Break off pursuit!

21:11.536 --> 21:13.163
They're retreating.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.432
Take us up!

21:18.744 --> 21:21.406
They took heavy damage- - 
shields, propulsion.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.141
Get us out of here.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.550
They've gone to warp.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.586
Match their course and speed.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.918
We can't, not until we restore
primary systems.

21:30.989 --> 21:31.921
Time?

21:31.990 --> 21:33.355
We'll need a few hours.

21:34.593 --> 21:37.061
At least we didn't
come away empty- handed.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.906
l want Ransom's tactical status.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.102
l want it now, Mr. Lessing.

21:54.913 --> 21:56.005
Or what?

21:56.081 --> 21:57.708
You'll hit me?

22:00.352 --> 22:01.614
No, Crewman.

22:01.687 --> 22:05.020
l'll drop the shields
around this room,

22:05.090 --> 22:09.459
and let your little friends
come pay you a visit.

22:09.528 --> 22:10.893
That would be murder.

22:11.029 --> 22:14.624
You could also call
it ''poetic justice.''

22:14.700 --> 22:16.292
l suppose the plan is

22:16.401 --> 22:19.336
that you're going to come
to my rescue now, right?

22:19.404 --> 22:21.338
There's no plan
as far as l know.

22:21.406 --> 22:22.839
The Captain's on her own.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.206
Ransom's status, now.

22:26.411 --> 22:28.208
No way in hell.

22:32.751 --> 22:36.243
We all make our own hell,
Mr. Lessing.

22:36.321 --> 22:38.516
l hope you enjoy yours.

22:38.590 --> 22:40.148
The com is active.

22:40.225 --> 22:41.658
We'll be outside

22:41.727 --> 22:43.695
if you have a change of heart.

22:52.504 --> 22:53.801
What are you doing?

22:53.872 --> 22:55.703
Weren't you listening?

22:57.008 --> 22:58.475
Don't do this.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.101
He'll break.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.278
Bridge to the Captain.

23:06.351 --> 23:09.218
We've lost shields
in Section 29- Alpha.

23:09.287 --> 23:10.720
l know. Stand by.

23:10.789 --> 23:12.450
He's a loyal officer.

23:12.524 --> 23:14.151
He's not going
to betray his Captain.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.284
Put up the shields.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.554
He'll break.

23:17.863 --> 23:19.023
Captain!

23:19.097 --> 23:20.758
As you were.

23:22.701 --> 23:25.169
Level nine authorization
required.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.704
Damn it, Kathryn!

23:26.772 --> 23:27.739
You're panicking.

23:27.806 --> 23:28.830
He's going to talk.

23:28.940 --> 23:32.137
Captain, a fissure
is opening in that section.

23:32.210 --> 23:33.234
Understood.

23:52.164 --> 23:55.497
Okay, you've demonstrated
your loyalty to your Captain.

23:55.567 --> 23:56.591
Fine.

23:56.701 --> 23:59.636
Now let's talk about the Ankari.

24:05.343 --> 24:06.674
lf there's an Ankari vessel

24:06.745 --> 24:08.508
less than two light- years
from here,

24:08.580 --> 24:09.877
why haven't we detected it?

24:09.981 --> 24:12.472
Apparently, they use
a unique form of propulsion,

24:12.551 --> 24:14.451
which makes them hard to find.

24:14.519 --> 24:16.282
You think they'll be
willing to help us?

24:16.354 --> 24:17.844
lt's worth a try.

24:17.923 --> 24:18.890
Mr. Lessing has agreed

24:19.024 --> 24:20.855
to show you
how to adjust the sensors.

24:20.926 --> 24:22.291
Once you find the Ankari ship,

24:22.360 --> 24:24.225
- set a course.
- Aye, sir.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.890
Did our prisoner disclose
any other information?

24:26.998 --> 24:28.056
l'm afraid not.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.897
The rest of you continue
with the repairs.

24:31.036 --> 24:33.027
Dismissed.

24:34.940 --> 24:35.907
Commander.

24:36.041 --> 24:38.236
All right.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.937
We're going to try it your way.

24:40.078 --> 24:42.638
But l want to make
one thing clear.

24:42.714 --> 24:44.944
Our first priority
is to get Ransom.

24:45.016 --> 24:47.177
lf there's one thing
you've made clear, it's that.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.845
We've had our disagreements,
Chakotay,

24:50.922 --> 24:53.083
but you've never
openly opposed me.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.591
You almost killed
that man today.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.650
lt was a calculated risk
and l took it.

24:56.728 --> 24:57.786
lt was a bad call.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.626
l'll note your objection
in my log.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.359
l don't give a damn
about your log.

25:01.466 --> 25:03.457
This isn't about rules
and regulations.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.833
lt's about right and wrong.

25:04.970 --> 25:05.994
And l'm warning you- -

25:06.104 --> 25:08.072
l won't let you
cross that line again.

25:09.207 --> 25:11.107
Well then you leave
me no choice.

25:11.176 --> 25:15.579
You are hereby relieved of duty
until further notice.

25:19.751 --> 25:21.548
What's happened to you, Kathryn?

25:21.620 --> 25:24.180
l was about to ask
you the same question.

25:37.302 --> 25:38.530
They are not responding.

25:38.637 --> 25:40.104
Tractor beam.

25:40.171 --> 25:42.799
Captain, the Ankari ship
has done nothing to...

25:42.908 --> 25:44.205
Just do it.

25:47.646 --> 25:49.170
We're being hailed.

25:49.247 --> 25:50.646
On screen.

25:51.316 --> 25:52.943
Starfleet.

25:53.084 --> 25:54.711
Yes.

25:54.786 --> 25:55.718
Leave us alone.

25:55.787 --> 25:57.414
There's nothing of value
on our ship.

25:57.489 --> 25:58.751
We need your guidance.

25:58.823 --> 26:01.485
Your spirits of good fortune
are attacking us.

26:01.593 --> 26:03.720
Of course they are.
You've been killing them!

26:03.762 --> 26:06.253
We are not the ones responsible.

26:06.331 --> 26:08.299
Equinox.

26:08.366 --> 26:09.390
That's right.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.526
Can you communicate
with the aliens?

26:11.636 --> 26:14.332
Release my ship.

26:14.439 --> 26:15.872
l can't do that.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.909
Not until you agree
to talk to them.

26:19.444 --> 26:21.241
l will summon them,

26:21.313 --> 26:23.747
but you must talk to them.

26:23.815 --> 26:25.908
You must convince them.

26:39.698 --> 26:43.464
They say they want
the humans to die.

26:43.568 --> 26:46.799
A difficult place
to start a negotiation.

26:46.905 --> 26:48.338
Will they understand me?

26:48.406 --> 26:49.771
Yes.

26:49.841 --> 26:52.105
We didn't do this to you.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.975
We're trying to stop
the humans who did.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.744
They don't believe
you would harm your own kind.

27:00.819 --> 27:03.652
We have rules for behavior.

27:03.722 --> 27:05.747
The Equinox has
broken those rules

27:05.824 --> 27:07.291
by killing your species.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.122
lt's our duty to stop them.

27:12.130 --> 27:17.158
Give us the Equinox.
Give us the Equinox.

27:17.268 --> 27:21.364
They insist on destroying
the ones who were responsible.

27:21.473 --> 27:25.500
We will punish them
according to our own rules.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.405
They will be imprisoned.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.381
They will lose their freedom.

27:33.351 --> 27:35.319
All right.

27:37.555 --> 27:41.491
lf you stop your attacks,
l'll deliver the Equinox to you.

27:41.559 --> 27:42.491
Captain...

27:42.560 --> 27:43.891
l know what l'm doing, Tuvok.

27:43.962 --> 27:46.795
These beings would destroy
Captain Ransom and his crew.

27:46.865 --> 27:47.889
What's their answer?

27:47.966 --> 27:49.729
Your behavior is irrational.

27:49.801 --> 27:51.063
We could find
another solution.

27:51.169 --> 27:53.103
l've already confined
my First Officer to quarters.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.229
Would you like to join him?

27:54.339 --> 27:55.533
Well?

27:57.308 --> 27:58.605
They agree.

28:03.648 --> 28:05.206
We're going to need more fuel.

28:05.283 --> 28:08.411
We've only got enough left
to jump another 500 light- years.

28:08.486 --> 28:12.616
''Fuel''? ls that the euphemism
we're using now?

28:12.691 --> 28:15.626
You mean we need
to kill more life- forms.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.093
Several more.

28:23.234 --> 28:27.034
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling

28:27.105 --> 28:29.198
Oh, my darling...

28:29.307 --> 28:31.332
Clementine...

28:31.443 --> 28:33.070
How much longer?

28:33.144 --> 28:34.202
Another hour.

28:34.279 --> 28:35.303
Maybe less.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.440
You are lost and gone forever...

28:38.516 --> 28:41.076
Dreadful sorry, Clementine...

28:41.152 --> 28:42.449
What are you doing?

28:42.520 --> 28:44.818
Her auditory processor.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.880
We used to practice duets
together.

28:47.025 --> 28:50.119
ln fact, l taught her
this old chestnut.

28:50.195 --> 28:52.186
Light she was

28:52.263 --> 28:53.457
And like a fairy...

28:53.531 --> 28:56.830
And her shoes
were number nine...

28:56.935 --> 28:59.631
Herring boxes without topses...

28:59.738 --> 29:02.764
Sandals were for Clementine...

29:02.941 --> 29:05.910
Drove she ducklings
to the water...

29:06.010 --> 29:07.204
Enough.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.805
Why the long face, Captain?

29:10.949 --> 29:14.043
You're about to get
your crew home.

29:14.119 --> 29:16.417
She tried to stand in your way.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.547
You had no choice.

29:18.623 --> 29:21.558
No choice.

29:21.626 --> 29:24.823
Thank you, Doctor.

29:26.965 --> 29:29.627
When this is all over,
perhaps you'll allow me

29:29.734 --> 29:31.258
to teach you my repertoire.

29:31.369 --> 29:33.337
l'm going to need
a new partner.

29:36.674 --> 29:38.437
Hmm.

29:38.510 --> 29:42.207
Drove she ducklings
to the water...

30:19.384 --> 30:21.511
You.

30:21.586 --> 30:23.611
What are you doing here?

30:23.688 --> 30:26.179
Hiding. Like you.

30:26.257 --> 30:28.088
l'm not hiding.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.722
lt's beautiful.

30:30.795 --> 30:33.263
l can see why
this brings you comfort.

30:33.331 --> 30:35.765
l don't know
what you're talking about.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.859
But it isn't real.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.960
You're not real.

30:40.138 --> 30:42.299
Now leave me alone.

30:42.407 --> 30:44.170
lt's not too late to stop.

30:44.242 --> 30:46.005
l don't have a choice.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.907
Find another way.

30:47.979 --> 30:49.640
There is no other way.

30:49.714 --> 30:50.806
Stop trying to hide.

30:50.882 --> 30:52.008
l told you! l'm not hiding!

30:52.083 --> 30:53.015
Now get away from me!

30:53.084 --> 30:54.574
End this.

30:54.652 --> 30:55.619
No!

31:00.558 --> 31:02.287
Bridge to Ransom.

31:05.964 --> 31:06.896
Go ahead.

31:06.965 --> 31:09.058
Janeway's found us.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.637
On my way.

31:20.011 --> 31:20.943
Distance?

31:21.012 --> 31:22.775
50,000 kilometers, closing fast.

31:22.847 --> 31:24.747
Maintain course.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.946
Voyager's approaching
at high warp.

31:28.086 --> 31:29.280
There's a class- 2 nebula

31:29.354 --> 31:30.651
less than a light- year
from here.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.849
Janeway's sensors won't
be able to track us

31:32.924 --> 31:33.856
once we're inside.

31:33.925 --> 31:35.358
l think that we
should pursue this...

31:35.426 --> 31:36.688
No. Open a channel.

31:36.761 --> 31:37.921
Change of tactics?

31:37.996 --> 31:39.361
You might say that.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.955
lt's time we found
another way home.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.533
Another way?

31:43.635 --> 31:46.729
We're going to cooperate
with Janeway, Max,

31:46.838 --> 31:49.204
if she's willing.

31:49.274 --> 31:51.003
Rudy, with all due respect,
have you lost your mind?

31:51.109 --> 31:52.736
Just the opposite.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.473
They're within range.
They're charging weapons.

31:56.547 --> 31:58.242
- Hail them.
- Belay that order.

31:58.316 --> 31:59.248
Raise shields.

31:59.317 --> 32:00.716
You're relieved of duty,
Commander.

32:02.353 --> 32:03.320
l'm taking command.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.982
Anyone who isn't with me,
speak up now.

32:11.062 --> 32:12.689
Take him to the brig.

32:20.138 --> 32:21.298
l'm sorry.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.337
What's the status
of our weapons?

32:29.414 --> 32:30.779
Full complement of torpedoes.

32:30.848 --> 32:32.873
Minimal phasers.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.317
Open a secure channel
to their Sick Bay.

32:35.386 --> 32:36.410
Stand by weapons.

32:36.487 --> 32:37.818
Aye, sir.

32:49.667 --> 32:50.929
l'm here.

32:51.035 --> 32:52.434
We going to need
your help, Doctor.

32:52.503 --> 32:54.835
See if you can find Voyager's
current shield frequency.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.874
Acknowledged.
l'll need a few minutes.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.705
They are firing torpedoes.

33:04.782 --> 33:07.148
Direct hit to our port shields.

33:07.218 --> 33:08.150
They're holding.

33:08.219 --> 33:09.379
Return the favor.

33:20.865 --> 33:21.797
This isn't the brig.

33:21.866 --> 33:22.958
l know.

33:25.036 --> 33:26.503
l'm with you, sir.

33:26.571 --> 33:28.937
Let's find a way to end this.

33:29.073 --> 33:32.531
We'll need to access
transporter control.

33:40.151 --> 33:41.778
We've damaged
their port nacelle.

33:41.853 --> 33:42.945
They're venting plasma.

33:43.087 --> 33:44.645
They're dropping out of warp.

33:44.722 --> 33:45.882
Stay with them.

33:51.963 --> 33:52.952
Doctor to Equinox.

33:53.097 --> 33:54.894
l've got their shield frequency.

33:54.966 --> 33:56.228
l'm transmitting it
to you now.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.426
They'll try to remodulate.

33:57.535 --> 33:58.467
Keep monitoring.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.128
Aye, sir.

34:00.238 --> 34:02.706
They've slowed
to one- quarter impulse.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.140
Prepare a tractor beam.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.676
They're launching
another torpedo.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.973
Full power
to the forward shields.

34:13.985 --> 34:16.179
Hull breach on Deck 4!

34:16.254 --> 34:17.721
How'd they get
through our shields?

34:18.856 --> 34:19.822
Hard about.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.188
Get us out of range.

34:21.259 --> 34:22.954
Remodulate the shields.

34:26.797 --> 34:27.889
They're retreating.

34:28.032 --> 34:28.896
Pursuit course.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.329
Maintain fire.

34:31.436 --> 34:33.165
They took out the weapons array!

34:33.271 --> 34:34.203
Tuvok?

34:34.272 --> 34:36.239
l've been rotating
the shield frequency

34:36.340 --> 34:37.568
every ten seconds.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.710
We've lost impulse engines.

34:40.777 --> 34:41.835
We're being hailed.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.402
lt's Ransom.

34:44.614 --> 34:46.844
Put him through.

34:46.918 --> 34:50.945
Captain, l'm prepared
to surrender the Equinox,

34:51.022 --> 34:52.683
but l'm no longer in command.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.590
Max decided to stage
a little mutiny,

34:55.659 --> 34:56.956
but l think l can stop him.

34:57.027 --> 34:58.359
l've isolated
transporter control.

34:58.429 --> 34:59.953
l can beam all of us to Voyager.

35:00.031 --> 35:03.023
You might want to have
some guards standing by.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.160
Not everyone here is going
to be happy to see you.

35:08.172 --> 35:09.400
Proceed.

35:10.575 --> 35:11.769
Ma'am?

35:11.843 --> 35:13.811
He's still a Starfleet Captain.

35:13.911 --> 35:16.812
He may have forgotten that
for a while,

35:16.881 --> 35:19.213
but l believe him.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.455
Someone's trying to beam us off.

35:27.525 --> 35:28.890
Force fields!

35:28.960 --> 35:31.087
They're deflecting
our targeting scanners.

35:31.162 --> 35:34.063
Then beam the others to Voyager,
yourself included.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.793
l'll take care of Max.

35:37.468 --> 35:38.799
Aye, sir.

35:38.903 --> 35:43.397
Computer, give me access
to the shield grid.

35:53.184 --> 35:55.175
Well...

35:55.253 --> 35:57.118
l see you've
made yourself at home.

35:57.188 --> 35:58.177
What are you doing here?

35:58.256 --> 35:59.655
Taking back my Sick Bay.

35:59.724 --> 36:00.748
Stop where you are.

36:00.858 --> 36:02.120
l've planted photonic charges

36:02.160 --> 36:03.559
throughout
these holo- projectors.

36:03.628 --> 36:06.119
With one command sequence,
l can blow out your entire...

36:06.197 --> 36:07.562
Computer, delete
the Equinox EMH.

36:11.435 --> 36:13.300
The Doctor's not
transmitting anymore.

36:13.371 --> 36:14.702
Burke to Doctor.
Report.

36:14.772 --> 36:17.468
l'm afraid your physician's
no longer on call.

36:18.943 --> 36:20.137
Max, this is the Captain.

36:20.211 --> 36:21.405
l've dropped the shield grid

36:21.479 --> 36:23.777
everywhere except the Bridge
and my current location.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.679
The vital systems are exposed.

36:25.750 --> 36:29.345
l suggest you beam to Voyager
while you still can.

36:31.722 --> 36:32.882
The core is overloading.

36:32.990 --> 36:34.617
We've got to get out of here.

36:34.692 --> 36:35.852
Where? Voyager's brig?

36:35.927 --> 36:37.656
lt's better
than being vaporized.

36:37.728 --> 36:39.457
We still have
a working shuttle.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.293
The Shuttle Bay's
two decks down!

36:41.365 --> 36:42.354
Sir, the aliens!

36:42.433 --> 36:43.525
We'll make it.

36:58.716 --> 36:59.740
This way.

37:16.334 --> 37:19.064
There's only one life sign left.

37:19.170 --> 37:21.035
lt's Ransom.

37:25.343 --> 37:26.776
Captain.

37:26.844 --> 37:28.869
Things didn't work out
exactly as l planned,

37:29.013 --> 37:30.878
but you've got everyone
worth getting.

37:30.948 --> 37:33.075
We're beaming you out of there.

37:33.150 --> 37:34.981
This ship is about to explode.

37:35.052 --> 37:37.213
l've got to put some distance
between us.

37:37.288 --> 37:38.755
l've accessed helm control.

37:38.823 --> 37:41.986
You can set auto- navigation
and then transport to Voyager.

37:42.059 --> 37:43.583
There's no time!

37:43.661 --> 37:46.152
You've got a fine crew, Captain.

37:46.230 --> 37:49.165
Promise me you'll get 'em home.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.428
l promise.

38:59.603 --> 39:02.163
Captain's Log, supplemental.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.173
With the Equinox destroyed,

39:04.241 --> 39:06.641
the aliens have withdrawn
to their realm.

39:06.711 --> 39:08.645
l've reinstated Chakotay,

39:08.713 --> 39:11.273
and we've set a course
for home.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.749
Good as new.

39:13.818 --> 39:16.582
l'd like you to regenerate
for the next few hours.

39:16.654 --> 39:18.417
lt'll help stabilize
your cortical array.

39:18.489 --> 39:19.421
Understood.

39:19.490 --> 39:22.823
Regarding the...

39:22.927 --> 39:25.725
unpleasantness
aboard the Equinox,

39:25.796 --> 39:27.991
l hope you don't
think less of me.

39:28.065 --> 39:30.192
Your program was altered.

39:30.301 --> 39:31.768
lt's quite
disconcerting to know

39:31.836 --> 39:33.030
that all someone has to do

39:33.137 --> 39:35.571
is flick a switch
to turn me into Mr. Hyde.

39:35.639 --> 39:37.504
Perhaps you should
enhance your program

39:37.575 --> 39:38.769
with security protocols.

39:38.843 --> 39:41.073
lt will prevent such
tampering in the future.

39:41.145 --> 39:42.305
Good thinking.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.211
When l'm done regenerating,
l will assist you.

39:44.281 --> 39:45.839
Thanks.

39:45.916 --> 39:48.441
You were off- key.

39:48.519 --> 39:49.508
l beg your pardon?

39:49.587 --> 39:52.488
''My Darling Clementine,''
third verse, second measure.

39:52.556 --> 39:53.648
That's impossible.

39:53.724 --> 39:58.252
Your vocal modulations
deviated by 0.30 deci- hertz.

39:58.329 --> 40:00.763
l can assist you
with that as well.

40:00.831 --> 40:02.423
Really?

40:02.500 --> 40:06.766
Holodeck 2,
tomorrow, 1600 hours.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.862
Just you, me...

40:08.973 --> 40:12.136
and a tuning fork.

40:12.209 --> 40:14.404
l look forward to it.

40:22.186 --> 40:24.654
The last time
we welcomed you aboard,

40:24.722 --> 40:26.781
you took advantage of our trust.

40:26.857 --> 40:29.257
You betrayed this crew.

40:29.326 --> 40:32.625
l won't make that mistake again.

40:32.696 --> 40:35.187
Noah Lessing, Marla Gilmore,

40:35.266 --> 40:38.793
James Morrow, Brian
Sofin, Angelo Tassoni,

40:38.903 --> 40:41.133
you are hereby stripped of rank.

40:41.238 --> 40:44.674
You'll be expected to serve
as crewmen on this vessel.

40:44.742 --> 40:47.233
Your privileges will be limited,

40:47.344 --> 40:49.835
and you'll serve
under close supervision

40:49.914 --> 40:51.939
for as long as l deem fit.

40:52.016 --> 40:55.645
This time, you'll
have to earn our trust.

40:55.719 --> 40:57.812
Dismissed.

41:02.927 --> 41:05.225
Repairs?

41:05.296 --> 41:06.888
Coming along.

41:13.537 --> 41:15.266
How's the crew?

41:15.372 --> 41:18.000
A lot of frayed nerves.

41:23.013 --> 41:25.709
Neelix is organizing
a potluck...

41:25.783 --> 41:28.081
to help boost morale.

41:28.152 --> 41:31.553
Will l see you there?

41:31.622 --> 41:33.681
l'm replicating the salad.

41:33.757 --> 41:36.089
l'll bring the croutons.

41:39.763 --> 41:41.390
Chakotay...

41:52.409 --> 41:54.343
you know...

41:58.082 --> 42:00.016
you may have had good reason

42:00.050 --> 42:02.746
to stage a little mutiny
of your own.

42:06.323 --> 42:09.349
The thought had occurred to me,

42:09.426 --> 42:12.987
but that would have
been crossing the line.

42:16.567 --> 42:19.161
Will you look at that.

42:26.710 --> 42:30.874
All these years,
all these battles.

42:30.948 --> 42:34.406
This thing's never
fallen down before.

42:42.927 --> 42:46.055
Let's put it back up
where it belongs.
