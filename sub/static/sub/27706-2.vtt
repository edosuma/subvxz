00:02.983 --> 00:03.899
<i>Previously on</i> The Passage...

00:03.984 --> 00:05.734
<i>My name is Amy Bellafonte.</i>

00:05.819 --> 00:07.277
<i>It didn't all start with me.</i>

00:07.363 --> 00:09.655
<i>So many things led
to what happened.</i>

00:09.782 --> 00:11.740
- It's him.

00:11.825 --> 00:13.116
<i>How is this possible?</i>

00:13.202 --> 00:15.118
I feel amazing.

00:15.204 --> 00:17.287
<i>Project Noah was born.</i>

00:17.414 --> 00:19.081
The Chinese avian flu has gone

00:19.208 --> 00:21.416
from outbreak to epidemic,
but the CDC

00:21.460 --> 00:23.919
<i>think the work we're doing
is our best hope for a vaccine.</i>

00:24.004 --> 00:25.921
<i>It's not just tweaks
to the formula.</i>

00:25.965 --> 00:28.924
-It's age.
-Are you suggesting we try
with a child?

00:29.009 --> 00:30.509
<i>I'm the girl from nowhere.</i>

00:30.594 --> 00:32.552
<i>The one no one will miss.</i>

00:32.680 --> 00:35.367
-Explain to me
why you need a kid.
-You know the people

00:35.391 --> 00:37.891
<i>we work for, Brad.
You can't cross them.</i>

00:38.018 --> 00:40.143
<i>He risked everything
to protect me.</i>

00:40.229 --> 00:42.145
<i>We became family.</i>

00:42.189 --> 00:44.389
The one thing that matters
is that you're safe.

00:45.109 --> 00:46.670
I will kill you.
Give me the girl.

00:46.694 --> 00:49.653
I'm not gonna leave you.
I promise.

00:49.697 --> 00:52.072
<i>Whatever was coming,</i>

00:52.157 --> 00:54.741
<i>we would face it together.</i>

What are we gonna do?

01:29.153 --> 01:31.320
- Hold on.

01:38.787 --> 01:40.120
Are you okay?

01:40.247 --> 01:42.080
Yeah.

01:44.585 --> 01:45.500
<i>Damn it!</i>

01:45.586 --> 01:46.918
Back up, turn around.

01:46.962 --> 01:49.004
Let's go. Let's go!

01:59.642 --> 02:01.308
Hang on.

02:06.815 --> 02:09.441
Come on.
I need my shirt.

02:09.526 --> 02:11.401
Follow me. Let's go.

02:11.487 --> 02:14.946
- You need a doctor.
- No, listen, I'm fine.

02:15.032 --> 02:16.384
You got to work with me, okay?
Whatever I say,

02:16.408 --> 02:18.470
-just go with it.
Can you do that?
-Okay.

02:18.494 --> 02:20.410
Hey. Hi.

02:20.454 --> 02:22.140
I'm Pete Erickson.
This is my daughter, Stella.

02:22.164 --> 02:23.705
We're brand-new to the school,

02:23.749 --> 02:25.769
and, ugh, I'm such an idiot.
I forgot everything.

02:25.793 --> 02:27.042
I forgot about the field trip,

02:27.127 --> 02:29.211
her-her T-shirt, her lunch.

02:29.296 --> 02:32.130
I'm just trying to get used
to this whole single dad thing.

02:32.174 --> 02:34.174
- Oh, it's just the two of you?
- Yeah.

02:34.218 --> 02:36.237
My mom ran off with her trainer.
He's 27.

02:36.261 --> 02:37.530
Oh, sweetie.
They don't need to know

02:37.554 --> 02:39.449
- the whole story.
- Has his own YouTube channel.

02:39.473 --> 02:41.117
Okay, great.
We're all up to speed.

02:41.141 --> 02:43.809
...Uh, can she get on the bus?

02:43.894 --> 02:46.853
- It's right here.
- All right. Hey...

02:49.483 --> 02:51.400
Okay, sweetie, have fun.

02:51.485 --> 02:52.901
All right.

02:52.945 --> 02:55.195
Thank you.
- Bye, Dad.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.280
Bye.

03:14.758 --> 03:16.383
No phones on the bus.

04:07.102 --> 04:08.518
Oh. Oh, I...

04:08.645 --> 04:10.415
Hey, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't do that

04:10.439 --> 04:11.980
if I were you.

04:12.107 --> 04:13.482
I hate the way she looks at me.

04:13.609 --> 04:14.858
Well...

04:14.985 --> 04:17.110
quit-quit looking at her.

04:17.196 --> 04:18.361
Hey!

04:18.447 --> 04:20.071
I'm in charge of Babcock,

04:20.156 --> 04:21.822
you're in charge of Fanning.

04:21.950 --> 04:24.159
All right? Worry about him.

04:50.854 --> 04:53.313
Mortality rate's almost 30%.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.441
...First few cases have been
reported in North Korea.

04:56.527 --> 04:58.860
They've closed the airports
in Beijing.

04:58.987 --> 05:01.238
This is terrifying.

05:01.323 --> 05:04.282
Not as terrifying as
the solution we've come up with.

05:04.409 --> 05:07.327
What's going on with the child?

05:07.412 --> 05:09.372
Still in the wind
with the agent.

05:09.414 --> 05:11.665
Well, I'm rooting for them.

05:12.751 --> 05:15.502
Well, I'm rooting for all of us.

05:15.587 --> 05:19.214
Jonas, I had to make the call,
so I did.

05:19.341 --> 05:21.258
And the child won't be harmed.

05:21.385 --> 05:23.844
We've been on this mountain
for too long.

05:25.514 --> 05:28.974
We're isolated,
cut off from everyday life.

05:29.017 --> 05:32.602
We're not qualified to decide
what's right or wrong...

05:32.646 --> 05:36.314
'cause we don't know
the difference anymore.

05:47.327 --> 05:48.535
Where are we going?

05:48.579 --> 05:51.746
I'm trying to figure...
figure it out.

05:51.832 --> 05:54.499
Are you okay? You look awful.

05:54.585 --> 05:55.917
No, I'm good.

05:56.003 --> 05:58.753
We'll just...

05:58.881 --> 06:01.298
I just need to stop
for a second.

06:29.411 --> 06:31.097
Is this the guy
who took your phone?

06:31.121 --> 06:32.223
- Yep.
- Can I get that number?

06:32.247 --> 06:33.538
It's not my phone.

06:33.624 --> 06:35.584
You just said
he took your phone.

06:35.626 --> 06:38.335
It's my sister's phone. I just
had it for the field trip.

06:38.420 --> 06:41.046
Okay, can I get
your sister's number?

06:41.173 --> 06:43.192
I don't know
my sister's phone number.

06:43.216 --> 06:45.634
How about your mom?

06:45.719 --> 06:49.054
She's on speed dial
on my sister's phone.

06:50.974 --> 06:53.308
Go back to your teacher.

06:54.645 --> 06:56.205
Get the mom's phone
from the school

06:56.229 --> 06:57.646
- and track the damn thing.

06:57.773 --> 07:00.273
Also, look for any cars stolen
in the area. He got off

07:00.359 --> 07:02.211
that bus.
He's gonna steal a car.

07:02.235 --> 07:05.028
It'll be an older model.
No GPS. Yeah?

07:05.113 --> 07:08.198
- Hi.
Wolgast and the kid
are still on the run.

07:08.283 --> 07:09.616
Police station was a disaster.

07:09.743 --> 07:12.786
Sheriff was killed
and three of my men.

07:12.913 --> 07:15.622
Well, so much for making
the world a better place.

07:17.542 --> 07:20.271
-Should we consider
finding another child?
-No.

07:20.295 --> 07:21.606
Wolgast is gonna talk,
and if he does,

07:21.630 --> 07:23.755
this whole operation
gets shut down.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.215
He's injured.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.444
He's got the kid with him.

07:26.468 --> 07:27.862
- I'll find him.
- Okay.

07:27.886 --> 07:29.719
Be careful.

07:29.805 --> 07:33.306
Should we tap
the ex-wife's phone?

07:34.851 --> 07:36.726
Yeah. Do it.

07:36.770 --> 07:38.665
Surgery went well.
We repaired the tendon.

07:38.689 --> 07:41.147
I'm happy.
Just need you to rest,

07:41.233 --> 07:42.502
and we'll see you
in a few weeks.

07:42.526 --> 07:45.026
So, basketball
in a few months, yeah?

07:45.153 --> 07:46.861
Oh, hell no, Nathan.

07:46.989 --> 07:48.488
We talked about this.

07:48.532 --> 07:50.426
You can play chess.
That's a sport. Look it up.

07:50.450 --> 07:52.450
- Dr. Wolgast. You have a call.
- Yeah?

07:52.494 --> 07:54.222
-Oh, great.
Just send it to my cell.
-Okay. All right.

07:54.246 --> 07:55.453
<i>This is Dr. Wolgast.</i>

07:55.580 --> 07:57.080
I think he might be dead.

07:57.165 --> 07:58.665
What? Who?

07:58.709 --> 07:59.874
Who is this?

07:59.960 --> 08:02.105
This is Amy Bellafonte.
The agent's with me.

08:02.129 --> 08:04.482
We tried to turn ourselves in,
but then some guys with guns

08:04.506 --> 08:05.786
came in, and the agent got shot,

08:05.882 --> 08:07.694
and he passed out,
and I think he might be dead.

08:07.718 --> 08:09.737
And everyone's a bad guy,
so I didn't know who to call.

08:09.761 --> 08:12.211
Okay, okay.
Okay, Amy, I'm glad you called.

08:12.305 --> 08:13.491
That was really smart of you.

08:13.515 --> 08:14.909
Look, I need you
to take a deep breath.

08:14.933 --> 08:17.809
Everything is gonna be
all right. Say that back to me.

08:18.854 --> 08:20.520
It's gonna be all right.

08:20.605 --> 08:22.647
Now, can you tell
if he's breathing?

08:22.774 --> 08:25.191
Put your hand on his chest.
Is it moving up and down?

08:28.405 --> 08:31.614
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Okay, he's alive.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.950
Hey, Amy,
how do you feel about blood?

08:34.035 --> 08:36.285
- I don't like it.
- I know, it's gross.

08:36.413 --> 08:38.493
But I just...
I need you to look, okay?

08:38.539 --> 08:39.873
Is it still bleeding?

08:44.546 --> 08:47.464
It's stuck to it.
It's all dried.

08:47.549 --> 08:50.675
Okay. Good. It means it stopped,
so just leave it.

08:50.761 --> 08:53.553
Do you see any signs?
Do you know where you are?

08:56.767 --> 08:58.475
It says "Tomah, La Crosse."

08:58.518 --> 09:01.478
- "14 West."
- You're in Wisconsin.

09:02.689 --> 09:05.148
Hey, I think
the agent's gonna be okay.

09:05.275 --> 09:06.483
But we need to wake him up.

09:06.526 --> 09:07.920
- Do you know what a noogie is?
- Yeah.

09:07.944 --> 09:10.256
All right. Make a fist and
rub your knuckles in his chest

09:10.280 --> 09:12.322
<i>super</i> hard so it hurts.

09:17.037 --> 09:19.329
What the hell?

09:19.414 --> 09:20.872
What'd you do that for?

09:20.957 --> 09:22.749
Your ex-wife told me to.

09:22.793 --> 09:24.918
- Wh-What?
- Let me talk to him.

09:25.003 --> 09:26.586
She wants to talk to you.

09:29.257 --> 09:31.508
Hello?

09:31.593 --> 09:34.010
- What is going on?
- Lila, no.

09:34.096 --> 09:36.554
- This is not your concern.
- How is it not my concern?

09:36.681 --> 09:38.159
You're injured.
You passed out.

09:38.183 --> 09:39.327
You may have internal bleeding.

09:39.351 --> 09:40.850
You have a child with you.

09:40.936 --> 09:42.914
Richards probably has guys
at the hospital watching you

09:42.938 --> 09:44.415
right now.
You're not involved in this.

09:44.439 --> 09:47.357
- Just tell...

09:54.991 --> 09:56.616
Damn it.

09:56.701 --> 09:58.368
Get in the car.

10:12.592 --> 10:15.426
So, this is it... just one dose?

10:15.512 --> 10:17.887
Just one dose.
- Then what's the chip

10:18.014 --> 10:18.888
in my neck for?

10:19.015 --> 10:21.933
Monitors your vital signs.

10:22.018 --> 10:23.643
Tells us your location.

10:27.023 --> 10:29.315
Sensitivity to sunlight

10:29.442 --> 10:30.608
is a side effect?

10:30.694 --> 10:31.943
Can be.

10:32.028 --> 10:34.320
But, if all goes well...

10:34.447 --> 10:37.282
you'll be impervious to disease.

10:41.955 --> 10:44.414
How is any of this legal?

10:46.418 --> 10:49.335
It's not, is it?

10:49.421 --> 10:51.921
If this was on the up-and-up,
you guys,

10:52.048 --> 10:56.426
you wouldn't be looking
for prisoners to experiment on.

11:01.850 --> 11:03.995
We're in a desperate situation,
Mr. Carter.

11:04.019 --> 11:05.560
So are you.

11:05.687 --> 11:07.979
I can't argue with that.

11:09.941 --> 11:14.402
But why am I more scared now
than I was on death row?

11:14.487 --> 11:16.946
I'm gonna make sure you come
through this

11:17.032 --> 11:18.781
with flying colors, Mr. Carter.

11:18.867 --> 11:21.826
I'll be back to check on you
in a bit.

11:26.833 --> 11:29.751
Is this the way you saw
your career, Dr. Lear?

11:32.339 --> 11:35.048
Using human beings as lab rats?

11:35.175 --> 11:38.343
No.

11:38.386 --> 11:41.054
I could never have imagined
any of this.

11:41.181 --> 11:43.097
<i>All right, I'm gonna say this</i>

11:43.183 --> 11:47.936
one more time. Please do not
bring Tim Fanning into this.

11:48.021 --> 11:50.605
He is an egomaniacal,
credit-grabbing monster,

11:50.690 --> 11:52.941
with a substance abuse problem.

11:53.026 --> 11:54.462
We've been friends with him
since college.

11:54.486 --> 11:55.735
When'd you turn on him?

11:56.655 --> 11:59.572
I just hate to see you grovel.

11:59.658 --> 12:01.783
I'm not groveling.

12:01.910 --> 12:03.618
You know why I'm doing this.

12:03.745 --> 12:05.828
Oh, no, no.
Do not blame this on me.

12:05.914 --> 12:08.142
We're doing this for you.
Why can't you see that?

12:08.166 --> 12:09.769
Because it's a Hail Mary
and it's crazy.

12:09.793 --> 12:13.086
I have to do something, Liz.

12:21.888 --> 12:23.888
Come here.

12:26.601 --> 12:29.394
You're all crooked.

12:35.151 --> 12:38.152
Help me.

12:38.238 --> 12:39.904
You know I hate ties.

12:39.990 --> 12:41.656
I know, I know.

12:44.786 --> 12:48.204
You can't change this, Jonas.

12:48.290 --> 12:51.082
If you want to help me...

12:51.167 --> 12:53.084
stay with me.

12:53.169 --> 12:54.752
That's what I want.

12:54.838 --> 12:56.296
I'm gonna do better than that.

12:56.381 --> 12:58.381
Oh, my God.
You don't listen.

12:58.466 --> 12:59.716
I know.

13:01.720 --> 13:05.013
Are you sad that you married me?

13:05.140 --> 13:06.681
Yes.

13:06.808 --> 13:08.141
Really?

13:10.812 --> 13:12.186
No.

13:12.314 --> 13:14.355
I love you.

13:14.482 --> 13:16.816
I love you, too.

13:28.079 --> 13:31.205
<i>All right, hang on. Hang on.</i>

13:31.291 --> 13:32.707
Your brain hallucinates

13:32.792 --> 13:36.127
your conscious reality.

13:36.212 --> 13:39.213
So all those amazing neurons
are generating your experience.

13:39.299 --> 13:41.549
They're-they're filling
in the gaps.

13:41.634 --> 13:43.885
Your sense of self...

13:43.970 --> 13:46.512
That's not real.
What we think of

13:46.639 --> 13:49.057
as our humanity,
as our-our selves...

13:49.184 --> 13:50.850
That's just a story

13:50.977 --> 13:53.561
that our neurons are telling us.
Now, this is

13:53.605 --> 13:57.148
extremely hard for me to swallow
because I have an enormous ego.

13:58.485 --> 14:00.068
<i>Jonas, I'm not interested.</i>

14:00.153 --> 14:03.279
I've got a book tour.
I'm not going to South America

14:03.365 --> 14:07.116
to-to look in some cave with you
for a myth. Thank you, but no.

14:07.202 --> 14:08.368
I have new evidence.

14:08.453 --> 14:09.994
Oh, yeah?

14:10.038 --> 14:12.705
The 250-year-old man,
he send you a selfie?

14:12.791 --> 14:15.583
Elizabeth has Alzheimer's.

14:21.216 --> 14:22.382
When was she diagnosed?

14:22.467 --> 14:25.301
Three months ago.
It's...

14:25.387 --> 14:27.261
it's early onset, but...

14:27.389 --> 14:28.596
it's so fast, Tim.

14:28.681 --> 14:30.326
I mean, she's gotten lost
in the city,

14:30.350 --> 14:31.494
like, three times already.

14:31.518 --> 14:33.810
Why didn't you call me?

14:33.853 --> 14:35.706
I'm a neurologist,
for God's sake.

14:35.730 --> 14:37.208
This Bolivia thing...
It could help her.

14:37.232 --> 14:40.650
I have a blood sample,
some scientist in Bogotá.

14:40.735 --> 14:42.443
You really have to see it.

14:42.529 --> 14:46.030
It's a game changer.

14:56.292 --> 14:57.792
Hey.

14:57.919 --> 14:59.460
No more phone calls, okay?

14:59.587 --> 15:02.171
You threw the phone out
of the window.

15:02.257 --> 15:04.193
Yeah. I threw the phone out
of the window

15:04.217 --> 15:06.487
because they can find us
if you make a phone call.

15:06.511 --> 15:08.219
Don't you watch TV?

15:08.346 --> 15:10.972
I watch a lot of TV, actually.
Usually the main guy

15:11.015 --> 15:12.493
- doesn't pass out
behind the wheel.

15:12.517 --> 15:15.935
I'd like to point out
that the main guy got shot.

15:17.188 --> 15:18.521
Where are we going?

15:18.606 --> 15:19.981
Do you have a plan?

15:21.359 --> 15:23.109
I have a friend in Wisconsin.

15:23.194 --> 15:24.527
You have a friend?

15:24.654 --> 15:26.112
Something wrong?

15:26.197 --> 15:29.240
No.

15:29.325 --> 15:30.616
Lila seems nice.

15:30.702 --> 15:32.577
Yeah.

15:32.662 --> 15:35.079
- Smart, too.
- Mm-hmm.

15:35.165 --> 15:37.707
Also, good in an emergency, so
good thing you hung up on her.

15:37.792 --> 15:39.728
- Hey, what is your problem?
- I don't know.

15:39.752 --> 15:41.397
I've been kidnapped,
shot at and chased,

15:41.421 --> 15:43.232
and the last thing I've had
to eat in 24 hours

15:43.256 --> 15:45.067
- is churros and doughnuts.
- Hey, that...

15:45.091 --> 15:47.528
-No. You had a hot dog
at the carnival.
-And then

15:47.552 --> 15:49.280
you decided it'd be
a great time to pass out.

15:49.304 --> 15:52.054
- I didn't decide to pass out.
- You said you wouldn't leave me.

15:52.098 --> 15:53.826
- I didn't leave you.
- Passing out was leaving me.

15:53.850 --> 15:54.910
I thought you were dead.

15:54.934 --> 15:56.614
- I'm not dead.
- Good.

15:56.644 --> 15:57.830
'Cause you don't get to die,

15:57.854 --> 15:59.187
and you don't get to pass out.

15:59.272 --> 16:00.624
And you don't get
to not have a plan.

16:00.648 --> 16:02.398
Okay.

16:02.484 --> 16:04.317
And you owe me a unicorn.

16:04.444 --> 16:08.196
Fine. Fine.

16:10.325 --> 16:13.451
Do I get anything out
of this deal?

16:13.578 --> 16:17.663
You don't leave me
and I don't leave you.

16:32.430 --> 16:34.889
- Why did we park so far away?

16:35.016 --> 16:36.724
And that's with the goats?

16:36.851 --> 16:38.537
The woman who lives here is kind
of an angry hermit.

16:38.561 --> 16:39.747
She likes things a certain way.

16:39.771 --> 16:41.011
The goats... the goats are new.

16:41.064 --> 16:42.625
I don't know anything
about the goats.

16:42.649 --> 16:45.316
Whoa, whoa.

16:45.443 --> 16:46.643
All right, cover your ears.

16:48.988 --> 16:51.989
Put your hands up.
Come on, come on.

17:00.416 --> 17:02.500
Bradley?

17:02.544 --> 17:04.377
What the hell happen to you?

17:04.462 --> 17:05.836
I got shot.

17:05.922 --> 17:07.838
Well, that's disappointing.

17:07.924 --> 17:09.298
Who's the kid?

17:09.384 --> 17:11.509
This is Amy Bellafonte.

17:11.594 --> 17:13.219
Hi.

17:13.304 --> 17:16.388
Amy, you want to go wash up?
Bathroom's upstairs.

17:17.934 --> 17:20.226
Okay. Thank you.

17:26.401 --> 17:29.318
You got a lot of firepower here,
even for you.

17:29.404 --> 17:32.280
Is it enough for whatever's
following you?

17:34.325 --> 17:36.117
It's that sketchy job, isn't it?

17:36.244 --> 17:39.495
I told you not to take that.

17:39.581 --> 17:41.789
I need shelter, Lacey.

17:41.916 --> 17:43.624
I raise goats now.

17:43.668 --> 17:45.229
Oh, yeah?
How's that going for you?

17:45.253 --> 17:48.546
Make my own cheese,
grow most of my own food.

17:48.673 --> 17:49.880
Also, I started painting.

17:49.966 --> 17:53.217
That all sounds magical.
Can we stay here or not?

17:54.929 --> 17:56.846
Go clean yourself up.

17:56.973 --> 17:58.534
There's a first aid kit
in the kitchen.

17:58.558 --> 18:00.057
Pain killers, too.

18:00.101 --> 18:02.162
And then you're gonna read me
into whatever mess

18:02.186 --> 18:04.020
you got yourself into.

18:08.151 --> 18:10.818
Listen up.

18:10.903 --> 18:14.280
He crossed into Wisconsin
three hours ago.

18:14.365 --> 18:16.574
I got to think he's headed
for Canada.

18:16.618 --> 18:19.452
The border patrol has been
alerted, but he is slippery,

18:19.537 --> 18:21.537
and he has friends.

18:21.623 --> 18:23.247
I want to be clear.

18:23.333 --> 18:26.542
If you have a shot, take it.
Shoot to kill.

18:26.628 --> 18:28.753
I got Carter's blood work.

18:28.796 --> 18:31.839
Looks like his T and B cell
receptors have already enhanced.

18:31.966 --> 18:33.716
That's good news.

18:33.843 --> 18:36.552
Look.

18:36.596 --> 18:38.346
He-he had a football injury,

18:38.473 --> 18:40.348
and all that cartilage

18:40.391 --> 18:43.017
is already restored.

18:43.144 --> 18:46.896
He got the formula
less than five hours ago.

18:46.981 --> 18:49.190
It always takes my breath away,

18:49.233 --> 18:50.961
-the power of what
you discovered.
-Yep.

18:50.985 --> 18:54.195
And yet we can't seem
to control it.

18:56.616 --> 19:00.618
Nichole...

19:00.703 --> 19:04.538
let's please not do this.

19:04.624 --> 19:06.540
Let the little girl go.

19:06.626 --> 19:08.376
Jonas...

19:08.461 --> 19:10.753
she's gonna come through.
She won't be harmed.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.172
How can you be so sure?

19:13.216 --> 19:15.716
Because there's no other option.

19:15.802 --> 19:17.885
You think I like it?

19:17.970 --> 19:20.346
You think I'm sleeping well?
I'm not.

19:20.473 --> 19:22.264
We have to do this.

19:22.350 --> 19:24.934
So we have to make sure
she comes through intact.

19:25.019 --> 19:27.687
Please, Jonas,
get your head in the game.

19:27.814 --> 19:30.314
She needs you.
I need you.

19:30.441 --> 19:33.359
Let's see this thing through.

19:33.486 --> 19:35.403
The thing you started.

19:40.284 --> 19:41.617
<i>Oh, my God,</i>

19:41.703 --> 19:45.329
- this is fascinating.
- Just take a look

19:45.415 --> 19:47.518
at the number of T and B
cell receptors in there.

19:47.542 --> 19:48.624
Yeah, I know.

19:48.751 --> 19:50.584
Never seen anything like this.

19:51.754 --> 19:53.337
This is huge.

19:53.423 --> 19:54.797
This could alter the course

19:54.882 --> 19:56.382
of Elizabeth's Alzheimer's.

19:56.467 --> 19:57.842
Jonas, this...

19:57.969 --> 20:00.386
could be the cure
for everything.

20:00.471 --> 20:03.389
- Can we be fast enough, though?
- Yeah, we will.

20:03.433 --> 20:06.559
I know, like, six billionaires
who'd bankroll this today.

20:06.602 --> 20:08.519
We just need to be careful.

20:08.646 --> 20:10.771
We want to maintain control.

20:10.815 --> 20:13.315
Jonas, we're gonna do everything
right, I promise. Okay?

20:13.401 --> 20:16.318
You just... you got to let me
do my thing

20:16.404 --> 20:18.529
where the-where the funding
is concerned.

20:18.614 --> 20:21.282
Sure. Thank you.

20:22.535 --> 20:24.034
This is amazing.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.120
Jonas, we're...

20:26.205 --> 20:27.913
we're gonna change the world.

20:29.208 --> 20:31.125
Yeah, you'll see.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.505
- How do you know the agent?
- Bradley?

20:36.591 --> 20:38.841
He was my student in the Navy.

20:38.926 --> 20:40.426
Land warfare.

20:40.553 --> 20:42.781
He was one of my favorites,
but don't tell him that.

20:42.805 --> 20:45.181
- You were in the Navy?
- Yep.

20:45.308 --> 20:48.184
- But you're not anymore?
- Nope.

20:48.227 --> 20:50.372
What, did you join it
right after high school?

20:50.396 --> 20:52.313
Actually, no.

20:52.398 --> 20:54.774
Before I was in the Navy
I was a nun.

20:54.859 --> 20:56.609
You're serious?

20:56.694 --> 20:58.277
God is Lacey's ex-husband.

20:58.362 --> 20:59.945
How do you know God's a man?

21:00.031 --> 21:01.322
Ex-wife, then.

21:01.449 --> 21:03.240
- You know about this?

21:03.326 --> 21:05.576
Bradley knows everything
about everyone.

21:05.620 --> 21:06.827
He asks questions.

21:06.954 --> 21:09.141
That's what made him
a good hostage negotiator.

21:09.165 --> 21:10.498
Like in bank robberies?

21:10.583 --> 21:13.667
And other high-stakes
negotiations, yes.

21:13.753 --> 21:14.919
Pretty fascinating, Amy.

21:15.004 --> 21:17.880
Amy, you want to go and feed
some goats?

21:18.007 --> 21:19.340
Sure.

21:19.425 --> 21:22.343
- Yeah, I'm not gonna come.
- No one asked you.

22:12.019 --> 22:13.853
Whoa.
It's just me.

22:15.273 --> 22:16.647
How did you know I was here?

22:16.732 --> 22:19.108
Well, who else do you know
in Wisconsin?

22:20.987 --> 22:23.112
Oh, man.

22:32.915 --> 22:35.018
- I got rid of your car, Bradley.
- What'd you do with it?

22:35.042 --> 22:36.959
I got a guy.

22:37.086 --> 22:39.753
Huh. I forgot
about your grilled cheese.

22:39.881 --> 22:42.081
It's one of your best qualities,
this sandwich.

22:42.174 --> 22:44.174
Thanks.

22:44.260 --> 22:46.218
Where's Amy?

22:46.345 --> 22:48.053
Upstairs, watching a movie.

22:48.180 --> 22:51.432
There you go.

22:51.517 --> 22:54.393
I, uh, arranged
a boat ride for you.

22:54.520 --> 22:57.479
- I can get you to Canada.
- Passports?

22:57.607 --> 22:59.940
I got a guy who can
get you across the border.

23:00.026 --> 23:01.650
You always got a guy.

23:01.736 --> 23:04.612
What are you gonna do
once you get to Canada?

23:04.739 --> 23:07.406
You know it's not over just
because you cross the border.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.761
If they keep chasing us,
we'll just go to Amsterdam.

23:09.785 --> 23:11.368
Amsterdam?

23:11.454 --> 23:13.245
Sure.

23:13.331 --> 23:16.373
These people are never
gonna stop, Bradley.

23:16.459 --> 23:18.500
They can get to Amsterdam.

23:18.586 --> 23:20.564
You won't be safe
until the public knows

23:20.588 --> 23:22.482
what you know
about Project Noah.

23:22.506 --> 23:24.506
I think they're after you

23:24.550 --> 23:27.676
more than they are
this precious little girl here.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.865
They'll just find another child,
won't they?

23:29.889 --> 23:33.015
That's right,
and that child will have just

23:33.142 --> 23:34.892
as sad a story as our Amy.

23:35.019 --> 23:36.955
Now you think about that
for a minute.

23:36.979 --> 23:39.146
I don't want
to be a whistleblower, Lacey.

23:39.273 --> 23:41.565
I tried that,
we almost got killed.

23:45.404 --> 23:47.488
Then let me do it.

23:49.283 --> 23:52.409
I have some things
to atone for, as you know.

23:54.997 --> 23:58.582
You get the girl safe
and I'll get the story out.

24:01.963 --> 24:04.296
Give me their names, Bradley.

24:04.382 --> 24:06.715
The 12 on death row.

24:06.842 --> 24:09.593
Who are they?

24:19.814 --> 24:23.023
Joseph Morrison.

24:23.150 --> 24:25.109
Victor Chavez.

24:25.152 --> 24:27.653
Kathy Turrell.

24:30.032 --> 24:32.533
David Winston.

24:32.618 --> 24:36.537
<i>Julio Martinez.</i>

24:36.622 --> 24:39.748
<i>Shauna Babcock.</i>

24:39.875 --> 24:41.834
<i>Anthony Carter.</i>

25:49.862 --> 25:51.820
Hey, you made it.

25:51.947 --> 25:54.114
I'm sorry, do I know you?

25:54.200 --> 25:55.960
Yeah, you do.
You will.

25:57.912 --> 25:59.870
Uh... okay.

26:00.956 --> 26:02.664
So how do you feel?

26:02.750 --> 26:06.502
Honestly,
I feel like a million bucks.

26:06.587 --> 26:08.879
Like I-I can fly

26:09.006 --> 26:11.757
or lift a car over my head
or something.

26:11.801 --> 26:13.945
That's what happens.
It feels so good at first,

26:13.969 --> 26:15.511
and then it gets a little janky.

26:16.680 --> 26:18.263
Everything is okay if you just

26:18.349 --> 26:19.807
do what he says.

26:19.850 --> 26:21.350
Do what who says?

26:21.477 --> 26:23.685
Hello, Carter. How are you?

26:23.771 --> 26:26.772
You look great.

26:26.857 --> 26:29.566
Doesn't he?

26:29.652 --> 26:31.110
So,

26:31.195 --> 26:34.446
how is my old friend Jonas?

26:34.532 --> 26:36.824
A little word of advice:

26:36.951 --> 26:39.284
don't trust him.

26:45.251 --> 26:48.377
Go on. Drink it.

26:51.298 --> 26:53.757
You know what?

26:54.927 --> 26:57.761
Nah, I'm good.

27:04.979 --> 27:07.146
Just do it.
First time's the hardest,

27:07.273 --> 27:08.772
and then you get to like...

27:08.816 --> 27:10.816
I said no.

27:14.905 --> 27:16.446
It's okay.

27:16.532 --> 27:19.032
You don't have to drink it now.

27:20.870 --> 27:22.806
You still
have to settle up, though.

27:22.830 --> 27:25.914
I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't have any money.

27:27.835 --> 27:30.335
Oh, we don't take money here.

27:32.381 --> 27:34.339
Oh.

27:41.348 --> 27:43.765
Wait...

27:45.186 --> 27:47.561
You pay with yourself.

27:50.316 --> 27:51.565
I don't...

27:51.650 --> 27:55.319
I don't want a thing
to do with you.

27:56.780 --> 27:57.821
Hey, Carter,

27:57.907 --> 27:59.948
give Jonas a message for me,
will you?

28:22.056 --> 28:24.075
- You want more lidocaine?
- No, I don't

28:24.099 --> 28:26.475
- need stitches. I'm fine.
- You're fine?

28:26.560 --> 28:28.644
Really? You got shot
and you passed out.

28:28.729 --> 28:30.854
Let's not throw
in a staph infection.

28:30.898 --> 28:34.066
How's Dave?
Is it Dave or David?

28:34.151 --> 28:35.587
- It's David.
- Mm.

28:35.611 --> 28:37.069
Of course it is.

28:37.154 --> 28:38.862
How is David?

28:38.948 --> 28:42.616
He's great. He's outside
waiting in the car, actually.

28:42.701 --> 28:44.054
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

28:44.078 --> 28:46.787
Did you crack a window for him?

28:46.914 --> 28:49.039
- Oh, sorry.
- So, what's

28:49.124 --> 28:51.500
the timeline on this
"having David's baby" thing?

28:51.585 --> 28:53.126
You pregnant already?

28:53.254 --> 28:55.420
No. I'm not.

28:56.757 --> 29:00.300
It kind of seems
like you are, though.

29:00.386 --> 29:03.387
You know,
what are you gonna do...

29:03.472 --> 29:04.930
Run away with this girl

29:05.015 --> 29:09.059
and make her pancakes in
Amsterdam on Saturday mornings?

29:11.188 --> 29:12.646
Yes.

29:23.784 --> 29:26.118
I watched our daughter die.

29:28.122 --> 29:30.038
I couldn't stop it.

29:32.710 --> 29:35.127
And I shut down, and...

29:35.254 --> 29:39.131
and I couldn't help you.

29:39.216 --> 29:41.758
And I couldn't let you help me,
and then I j...

29:41.885 --> 29:44.469
I just stopped believing
in anything.

29:48.726 --> 29:51.059
But then I met this little girl.

29:52.563 --> 29:55.355
She's great.

29:55.482 --> 29:57.691
She's a tomboy.

30:00.154 --> 30:01.570
Just like Eva.

30:01.655 --> 30:05.866
Like Eva, yeah.

30:05.951 --> 30:07.492
So much.

30:13.292 --> 30:15.751
She doesn't have anybody.

30:18.130 --> 30:19.250
And it's so clear to me

30:19.298 --> 30:20.817
that what I'm supposed to do
right now

30:20.841 --> 30:23.133
is to make sure that she's safe.

30:25.387 --> 30:28.889
It's the only thing that's
made sense to me in a long time.

30:30.976 --> 30:33.977
I've missed you.

30:53.832 --> 30:56.917
- Psst. -00 a.m.

30:57.044 --> 30:57.959
Can't sleep?

30:58.045 --> 30:59.461
Mm-mmm.

30:59.588 --> 31:01.088
Me neither.

31:01.215 --> 31:04.424
Can I ask you
a personal question?

31:04.551 --> 31:06.343
Yeah.

31:06.387 --> 31:07.969
Are you an assassin?

31:08.055 --> 31:09.471
No.

31:09.556 --> 31:11.014
Okay.

31:11.058 --> 31:14.226
'Cause you assassinated
some people today.

31:15.312 --> 31:18.772
I served in Afghanistan.

31:18.857 --> 31:20.649
And, uh,

31:20.776 --> 31:23.985
then I became a federal agent.

31:24.113 --> 31:26.196
And...

31:26.281 --> 31:29.032
It was pretty scary today, huh?

31:30.244 --> 31:33.203
Can I ask you
another personal question?

31:34.289 --> 31:36.415
Sure.

31:36.542 --> 31:39.793
Do you believe in God?

31:48.303 --> 31:50.512
You thinking about your mom?

31:53.600 --> 31:56.685
Of course you are.

31:59.022 --> 32:01.940
You know, when people die,
it's our job to remember them.

32:03.152 --> 32:05.110
Even if it hurts.

32:09.199 --> 32:11.950
How about I read to you?

32:11.994 --> 32:15.662
I can just keep reading
until you fall asleep.

32:17.583 --> 32:20.750
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:23.755 --> 32:25.422
From the beginning?

32:25.549 --> 32:26.734
- Yeah.
- Mm.

32:26.758 --> 32:28.258
Flashlight.

32:31.930 --> 32:34.181
Oh.

32:34.308 --> 32:35.682
Okay.

32:35.767 --> 32:38.310
Here we go.

32:41.064 --> 32:44.774
"It was a dark and stormy night.

32:44.818 --> 32:48.028
"In her attic bedroom

32:48.155 --> 32:49.155
"Margaret Murry,

32:49.198 --> 32:51.573
"wrapped
in an old patchwork quilt,

32:51.658 --> 32:53.825
"sat on the foot of her bed

32:53.952 --> 32:56.286
"and watched the trees tossing

32:56.371 --> 32:58.997
<i>in the frenzied lashing
of the wind."</i>

33:01.919 --> 33:04.127
<i>And you don't know
how this got on your bed?</i>

33:04.254 --> 33:05.879
I got a notice
to pick this car up.

33:06.006 --> 33:07.172
That's all I know.

33:07.257 --> 33:08.902
- Where you taking it?
- To the impound,

33:08.926 --> 33:10.820
where I take 'em all.
That's my job.

33:10.844 --> 33:12.864
And you don't know
who called this one in?

33:12.888 --> 33:15.096
It got sent through dispatch.

33:15.182 --> 33:18.058
I don't know who called them,
so can I go or what?

33:22.731 --> 33:26.358
I think you know exactly who
asked you to transport this car.

33:26.401 --> 33:28.735
- Tell me now.
- I do jobs for her sometimes.

33:28.820 --> 33:32.030
- She pays me in cash.
- I want a name.

33:33.116 --> 33:35.408
Lacey.
Lacey Antoine.

33:44.211 --> 33:46.171
- Department of Defense?
- Oh, yeah.

33:46.213 --> 33:48.024
- Are you out of your mind?
- They came through

33:48.048 --> 33:50.068
with the most money, by far.
They see it as a way

33:50.092 --> 33:51.694
- to combat infectious disease.
- Tim, this-this timetable

33:51.718 --> 33:54.261
- is insane.
- Don't you see?

33:54.304 --> 33:56.864
We go with the guys who make the
rules so we can break the rules.

33:58.392 --> 33:59.494
What-what are you saying?

33:59.518 --> 34:01.226
I'm talking about a fast track.

34:01.353 --> 34:03.456
You're talking about tossing
ethics in the garbage.

34:03.480 --> 34:07.315
Elizabeth... this is for you.

34:07.442 --> 34:09.359
No, this is for you.

34:09.485 --> 34:11.735
I want you to stay with me.

34:11.822 --> 34:13.737
And you're either going to fail

34:13.824 --> 34:15.217
or you're gonna
cross some ethical line

34:15.242 --> 34:16.928
that you've worked your whole
life to uphold.

34:16.952 --> 34:20.286
You will look back on this
with searing regret,

34:20.414 --> 34:22.539
and you won't have me
to talk to about it,

34:22.583 --> 34:25.250
because this disease is going
to have its way with me

34:25.335 --> 34:26.835
no matter what you do.

34:35.887 --> 34:38.888
Mr. Carter, how are you
feeling today?

34:38.931 --> 34:40.473
I just did six miles,

34:40.559 --> 34:42.536
and I felt like I could've
kept going forever.

34:42.561 --> 34:44.185
Well, that's excellent.

34:44.313 --> 34:47.438
I've been having
bad dreams, though.

34:47.482 --> 34:49.815
Maybe I can get something
for that?

34:49.900 --> 34:52.402
A sleeping pill?
Sure.

34:54.406 --> 34:58.408
Anything remarkable
about your dreams?

34:58.493 --> 35:01.036
Yeah.

35:01.121 --> 35:03.538
It's the same guy every time.

35:03.582 --> 35:06.750
And I think you know him...
That Dr. Tim Fanning.

35:06.835 --> 35:09.753
He says he's a friend of yours,

35:09.880 --> 35:13.715
but that I shouldn't trust you.

35:13.842 --> 35:15.842
He says to tell you that...

35:15.886 --> 35:18.219
you already changed the world.

35:18.347 --> 35:21.181
You just have to wait
and see how.

35:33.195 --> 35:35.987
<i>Hey, honey. You look beautiful.</i>

35:36.073 --> 35:39.407
<i>Sorry I'm late.
I'm not having a great day.</i>

35:40.952 --> 35:43.495
Everything's spinning
out of control and, uh...

35:46.083 --> 35:48.458
...and it's all my fault.

35:52.881 --> 35:55.882
You were so right.

35:56.009 --> 35:59.302
I think I may have missed...

35:59.388 --> 36:01.388
a lecture.

36:04.559 --> 36:08.895
But nobody here will tell me
what day it is.

36:13.610 --> 36:15.985
I miss you so much.

36:29.251 --> 36:32.502
Hey, baby.

36:32.587 --> 36:34.504
You miss me?

36:34.589 --> 36:36.005
I... I thought

36:36.091 --> 36:38.717
they pulled you off the floor.

36:38.802 --> 36:40.135
Not enough bodies.

36:40.220 --> 36:42.198
- Lucky me.
- Why do you hit her cage?

36:42.222 --> 36:44.514
Stop antagonizing her.

36:44.641 --> 36:48.101
Oh, God, I hate it here.

36:48.186 --> 36:51.479
No cell phones, no Wi-Fi.

36:51.565 --> 36:53.525
Only good thing about
this place...

36:53.567 --> 36:55.545
It's about the last place
in the world

36:55.569 --> 36:58.236
you can still
call a bitch a bitch.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.613
...All right, all right,

37:00.699 --> 37:02.760
stop, stop. Come on, let's go.
Let's just go.

37:02.784 --> 37:04.617
We're done here, man, come on.

37:04.703 --> 37:07.579
Did you want to try?

37:07.706 --> 37:11.332
-It'll be fun.
Come... Come on. Oh.
-I don't...

37:11.418 --> 37:13.855
-Grey, you're such a tight
little guy. Come on.
-Uh...

37:13.879 --> 37:15.799
I look at you,
I get constipated.

37:15.881 --> 37:17.942
- Come on. Come on, come on.
We're doing it.
-No...

37:17.966 --> 37:20.278
-No, no! No.
-Come on. Come on.
It'll be fun. Come on, come on.

37:20.302 --> 37:21.863
No, no, no!
No, I can't-I can't...

37:21.887 --> 37:24.179
- No, let me go.
- Oh, you're such a wimp, Grey.

37:24.264 --> 37:26.848
- No, I... Okay, can I...
- Oh! Oh. Oh...

37:26.933 --> 37:28.933
No! No...

37:29.019 --> 37:31.686
- Oh...
- Whoops.

37:31.772 --> 37:33.833
Richards is gonna kill me.
He's gonna kill me.

37:33.857 --> 37:35.940
Well, you better go get it.

37:38.612 --> 37:40.612
All right, all right, all right.

38:05.013 --> 38:08.348
Oh!

38:08.433 --> 38:09.557
Whoa.

38:09.684 --> 38:11.370
- That was pretty good, Grey.
- Thanks a lot.

38:11.394 --> 38:13.164
Thanks a lot, man.
Thanks a lot.

38:13.188 --> 38:15.396
I didn't think
you had it in you.

38:15.482 --> 38:17.482
- All right, let's go.
- Well...

38:17.609 --> 38:20.735
maybe she's a good girl
after all. Hmm?

38:20.821 --> 38:21.861
Maybe she's been...

38:24.574 --> 38:25.782
No, no, no, no!

38:25.867 --> 38:28.743
Help! Help!

38:28.829 --> 38:31.162
Help!

38:34.167 --> 38:37.460
Help! Help!

38:37.587 --> 38:40.421
Help!
Help!

38:51.518 --> 38:53.351
- Everybody ready?
Look what I found.
Almost.

38:55.605 --> 38:57.458
- Here are the waters.
- Thank you.

38:57.482 --> 38:59.460
Hey, did you brush your teeth
this morning?

38:59.484 --> 39:02.485
Let me see.
Look at that smile.

39:03.989 --> 39:06.447
Everyone ready?

39:06.575 --> 39:07.969
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

39:07.993 --> 39:11.202
Mm-hmm.
We go out the back door.

39:11.288 --> 39:12.723
There's plenty of trees
for cover,

39:12.747 --> 39:16.124
and, uh, the lake
is a straight shot from there.

39:16.251 --> 39:19.586
Amy, I intend to see you again,
my friend,

39:19.671 --> 39:22.630
so you and I are not
gonna get all teary.

39:29.347 --> 39:31.723
All right, right there.

39:33.226 --> 39:34.976
Three Tahoes.

39:35.020 --> 39:36.956
- Eight to ten guys.
- They'll be coming.

39:36.980 --> 39:39.647
All right, take cover. Stay low.
Take her somewhere safe.

39:39.774 --> 39:41.399
Stay away from the windows.

39:57.083 --> 40:00.168
- Contact, left.
- Copy.

40:04.591 --> 40:07.216
- Clear.
- Clear.

40:09.012 --> 40:10.762
...Lacey!

40:25.737 --> 40:27.070
Wolgast,

40:27.155 --> 40:28.966
come out of the house
with the girl

40:28.990 --> 40:31.240
or I'll burn it down.

40:56.393 --> 40:59.143
Richards!

40:59.229 --> 41:01.688
I'm coming out.

41:01.815 --> 41:03.481
Don't shoot.

41:23.086 --> 41:24.544
Don't shoot.

41:41.688 --> 41:44.188
On your knees.

41:48.820 --> 41:50.987
Where's the girl?

41:51.072 --> 41:52.280
She's not here.

41:52.407 --> 41:55.074
I put her on a boat to Canada.

41:55.160 --> 41:57.827
I will kill you.

41:57.871 --> 41:59.412
You tell me where she is.

41:59.497 --> 42:02.582
<i>She's not here.</i>

42:07.380 --> 42:10.715
You have three seconds
to tell me.

42:11.926 --> 42:13.384
Three.

42:16.222 --> 42:18.389
Two.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.116
I'm here.

42:37.202 --> 42:39.118
I'm right here.

42:39.204 --> 42:40.912
What are you doing?

42:41.039 --> 42:44.749
You don't leave me,
I don't leave you.

42:51.549 --> 42:53.091
You want us to sweep the house?

42:56.054 --> 42:58.304
No.

42:58.389 --> 43:02.016
We got what we need.
