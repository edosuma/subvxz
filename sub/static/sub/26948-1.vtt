<i>Rip-Fixes-Sync
by VaVooM</i>

00:48.751 --> 00:50.948
Keep your arms up.
Don't forget to smile.

00:50.983 --> 00:53.161
Nathan, you're still recovering.
Don't do the triple Axel.

00:53.185 --> 00:54.818
Yeah, I won't, I promise.

00:54.854 --> 00:56.331
Have an ice pack ready.
He's gonna try the triple Axel.

00:56.355 --> 00:58.689
- Get the ice.
- Perfect spiral.

00:58.724 --> 01:01.158
You were amazing!

01:01.193 --> 01:03.126
You know, I got a little
emotional out there,

01:03.162 --> 01:06.296
thinking that this is
our second-last show ever.

01:06.332 --> 01:09.032
You're not second-guessing
leaving the tour, are you?

01:09.068 --> 01:11.535
No, no, I'm not.
I'm so excited.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.370
We're finally gonna do it...

01:13.405 --> 01:16.139
buy an ice rink,
start our own training center.

01:16.175 --> 01:18.175
And after four years on tour,
finally be home.

01:18.210 --> 01:21.678
Be in the same place for more than
two days, have a real Christmas.

01:21.714 --> 01:24.081
- What's a real Christmas?
- I forget.

01:24.116 --> 01:26.516
Something that's not in a hotel
or on a tarmac.

01:26.552 --> 01:28.151
Right.

01:28.187 --> 01:29.865
I'm gonna get a tree
from the Miller's farm

01:29.889 --> 01:31.666
and take all my Christmas
decorations out of storage.

01:31.690 --> 01:33.924
I'll decorate the house
exactly like my mom used to.

01:34.496 --> 01:38.495
- I can't wait to finally be home.
- Me too.

01:38.530 --> 01:39.763
We should finish packing.

01:39.798 --> 01:41.176
We have to be at the airport
at 5:00.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.834
Where are we going again?
Santa...

01:43.869 --> 01:46.503
- San Senova.
- San Senova, right.

01:47.806 --> 01:50.007
Tiny country,
big tourist destination.

01:50.042 --> 01:53.010
- I hope it's nice.
- It'll be great.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.234
- Thank you, Dawson.
- Sir.

02:17.269 --> 02:19.036
Your Majesty.

02:19.071 --> 02:24.408
Nicholas, you've spent the last 30 years
as my best friend calling me "Alex".

02:24.443 --> 02:27.477
That's when you didn't
use more colorful names.

02:27.513 --> 02:29.947
Would you prefer
one of the more colorful names?

02:33.485 --> 02:34.751
Thank you, Paul.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.264
The west wing,
extensively refurbished

02:36.288 --> 02:39.323
by the late Christmas King and...

02:39.358 --> 02:41.825
Oh, sir, I'm so sorry.

02:41.860 --> 02:44.461
Didn't we discuss keeping
the tourists to the east wing?

02:44.496 --> 02:47.397
I'll inquire about it
again, sir.

02:51.203 --> 02:53.103
Where did that come from?

02:53.138 --> 02:57.140
Princess Christina requested
that it be placed in here.

02:57.176 --> 03:00.444
Why do I somehow think that
that relates to this?

03:00.479 --> 03:02.012
How is my father
the Christmas King,

03:02.047 --> 03:03.647
and I'm the Grinch King?

03:03.682 --> 03:07.017
Well, your father founded
the Christmas Market,

03:07.052 --> 03:08.952
and the caroling concert,

03:08.988 --> 03:11.021
and the holiday benefit
for the community center,

03:11.056 --> 03:14.591
while you, when asked about
your feelings towards Christmas,

03:14.626 --> 03:16.994
remarked that it's
"good for the economy".

03:17.029 --> 03:18.962
It is good for the economy.

03:18.998 --> 03:22.332
Alex, it's your third Christmas
as king of a country

03:22.368 --> 03:23.867
founded around the holiday,

03:23.902 --> 03:26.103
and you're yet to show
any Christmas cheer.

03:26.138 --> 03:28.116
I know that Christmas can be
a hard time for you, but...

03:28.140 --> 03:32.409
It's not hard.
Look, I'm just busy.

03:33.912 --> 03:35.379
Look who's here.

03:35.414 --> 03:37.881
I can see that I've
walked in on something.

03:37.916 --> 03:38.949
Hello, Aunt Patricia.

03:40.419 --> 03:45.555
The princess is wondering if you'll be
having dinner together tonight.

03:45.591 --> 03:48.558
You've got your meet-and-greet
with the dignitaries this evening.

03:48.594 --> 03:49.993
Can it be moved?

03:50.029 --> 03:52.362
It's already been
rescheduled twice.

03:54.666 --> 03:56.666
Tell her I'll do my best.

04:00.105 --> 04:02.806
This place is like
a storybook come to life.

04:02.841 --> 04:04.708
Yes, one where
my fairy godmother

04:04.743 --> 04:07.978
gives me a cute boy
and some mistletoe.

04:08.013 --> 04:10.080
They really love Christmas here.

04:10.115 --> 04:12.682
According to this, this country
was founded on Christmas Eve.

04:12.718 --> 04:15.519
There are nonstop
holiday events, traditions.

04:15.554 --> 04:17.887
There's even a tour
of a decorated palace.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.555
Unfortunately,
it's during our show time.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.324
There is a Christmas Market
we can visit.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.660
Perfect. I knew I left
my Christmas shopping

04:23.695 --> 04:25.495
till the last minute
for a reason.

04:31.370 --> 04:33.737
<i>Excuse me, ma'am,
is this dog yours?</i>

04:33.772 --> 04:36.039
<i>Oh, no, right.
I'm so sorry.</i>

04:36.075 --> 04:39.009
<i>- I turn around for one second...
- That's all right.</i>

04:40.045 --> 04:41.078
Daddy!

04:42.614 --> 04:44.581
I'm so sorry about dinner.

04:44.616 --> 04:45.749
Tomorrow night, I promise.

04:48.420 --> 04:51.688
- How was your skating lesson?
- I'm learning a spiral.

04:51.723 --> 04:55.025
A spiral!
Marvelous.

04:55.060 --> 04:58.361
Perhaps I can come down tomorrow
and watch you practice.

04:58.397 --> 05:00.730
It's getting late.
It's time to sleep.

05:00.766 --> 05:03.233
But I haven't finished my movie.

05:03.268 --> 05:05.735
A Christmas movie.

05:05.771 --> 05:07.537
Well, let me guess how it ends,

05:07.573 --> 05:11.208
as there is only one fitting
ending for a Christmas story.

05:11.243 --> 05:15.779
The tree is lit,
the mistletoe is kissed under,

05:15.814 --> 05:17.814
and a merry Christmas
is had by all,

05:17.850 --> 05:21.651
and to all a good night.

05:21.687 --> 05:22.886
I love you, Tina-bear.

05:24.189 --> 05:25.355
I love you too.

05:31.063 --> 05:34.364
Daddy, it doesn't matter
what anyone says.

05:34.399 --> 05:36.433
You're not a Grinch.

05:39.438 --> 05:41.138
Good night, Christina.

05:50.282 --> 05:52.883
It does. Looks happy.

05:53.118 --> 05:55.452
There's nothing to worry about.

05:55.487 --> 05:58.421
You know, you'll make your
speech opening Christmas Market,

05:58.457 --> 06:02.092
shake some hands,
wish some Merry Christmases.

06:02.127 --> 06:04.527
It'll be good.

06:04.563 --> 06:06.229
Yeah, it'll be great.

06:06.264 --> 06:07.864
It's a chance to connect
with the people

06:07.899 --> 06:12.068
and move past this whole
Grinch King business.

06:12.104 --> 06:13.603
Who knows? After today,

06:13.638 --> 06:17.173
I might be known as
the second Christmas King.

06:21.613 --> 06:25.882
All right, you'll do great.
Just, you know, be yourself and...

06:25.917 --> 06:27.617
you know, speak from the heart.

06:27.652 --> 06:29.319
Just not sure I can do both.

06:29.354 --> 06:32.789
Well, then,
just stick to the speech.

06:32.824 --> 06:34.524
All right?
I'll go speak to the press.

06:43.769 --> 06:46.903
It's so magical.
Look at these decorations.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.306
This is so cute.

06:51.309 --> 06:52.909
We should get it as a souvenir.

06:52.944 --> 06:55.178
It can be a good luck charm
for our skating arena.

06:55.213 --> 06:58.047
By the way, I spoke to a
real estate agency this morning.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.694
They're gonna start
looking for rinks for us.

06:59.718 --> 07:01.451
- That's great.
- Yeah.

07:01.486 --> 07:03.030
You should go get warmed up
for the show.

07:03.054 --> 07:04.298
I'll buy this.
I'll meet you there.

07:04.322 --> 07:06.956
Sounds good.
I'll see you soon.

07:06.992 --> 07:08.691
- Sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.957
No. "Christmas honor".

07:40.992 --> 07:43.460
"Honor Christmas.

07:43.495 --> 07:45.995
Honor it with all my heart".

07:47.165 --> 07:49.399
I'm...

07:49.434 --> 07:51.601
- I must apologize.
- No, I'm sorry.

07:51.636 --> 07:52.814
I didn't see anyone
hiding there.

07:52.838 --> 07:56.439
- Well, I wasn't hiding.
- Right, of course.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.186
I mean, it kinda looked like
you were hiding.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.643
Really? And from whom
would I be hiding?

08:00.679 --> 08:03.279
I don't know,
the Christmas crowds?

08:03.315 --> 08:07.317
Hiding from Christmas.
If only that was an option.

08:07.352 --> 08:09.752
I take it you're not a fan
of the holiday.

08:09.788 --> 08:13.556
No, no, I am a fan.
Big fan. The biggest.

08:14.893 --> 08:18.795
I honor Christmas
with all my heart and...

08:18.830 --> 08:21.631
and...

08:21.666 --> 08:23.433
And try to keep
for all the year?

08:23.468 --> 08:24.801
Yes, that.

08:26.171 --> 08:28.037
That was very believable.

08:28.073 --> 08:31.307
Well, it was believable
because it's the truth.

08:31.343 --> 08:35.544
Blessed is the season where...

08:35.580 --> 08:39.282
Which engages the whole world
in a conspiracy of love.

08:39.317 --> 08:42.018
I knew it was something
to do with conspiracy.

08:42.053 --> 08:44.487
What are you, some sort
of Christmas quote book?

08:44.523 --> 08:47.690
- I just like Christmas.
- So I see.

08:48.026 --> 08:50.092
Well, whatever you're doing,
good luck.

08:50.128 --> 08:52.094
Hope you find
your Christmas cheer.

08:52.130 --> 08:54.363
Thank you,
and I don't need to find it

08:54.399 --> 08:56.632
because, well,
I'm brimming with it.

08:56.668 --> 09:01.604
Behold. Christmas waves
a magic wand across the world

09:01.639 --> 09:03.339
and makes everything
more beautiful.

09:04.475 --> 09:06.642
- Good luck.
- Well, I don't need luck.

09:11.716 --> 09:13.516
Okay, it's time.

09:13.551 --> 09:16.485
I told the press you'd do a quick
photo op before the speech,

09:16.521 --> 09:18.888
- Are you good?
- Yes.

09:18.923 --> 09:20.790
Great.
Okay, I'll see you on there.

09:25.496 --> 09:29.198
Hi. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

09:29.234 --> 09:33.202
Ladies and gentlemen,
King Alexander of San Senova.

10:06.037 --> 10:07.403
Merry Christmas.

10:10.642 --> 10:12.275
Good luck.

10:12.310 --> 10:14.677
You're gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

10:15.914 --> 10:18.347
It's our last show.

10:18.383 --> 10:21.083
It's a good thing.
We're finally going home.

10:21.119 --> 10:23.119
I know. You're right.

10:23.154 --> 10:24.420
We'll have stability.

10:24.455 --> 10:26.055
- Yes.
- We'll plant roots.

10:26.090 --> 10:28.391
And we can finally
see some friends.

10:28.426 --> 10:31.794
Yes, and maybe even
start dating again.

10:31.829 --> 10:35.431
- I think the curtain's going up.
- Yeah, of course you do.

10:35.466 --> 10:37.733
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

10:49.647 --> 10:52.548
He was covered in plum pudding!

10:55.487 --> 10:58.421
- Are you excited about the show?
- Yes.

10:58.456 --> 11:00.289
Well, I've got a little
surprise for you.

11:00.325 --> 11:04.560
How about after the show we'll go
around and meet the skaters?

11:04.596 --> 11:06.529
- Really?
- Yes.

11:24.783 --> 11:25.783
Cheers!

11:27.418 --> 11:29.218
We did it!

11:29.254 --> 11:30.820
Congratulations.

11:30.855 --> 11:32.155
Thank you.

11:32.190 --> 11:33.656
That was so good.

11:33.691 --> 11:35.236
- You were beautiful, as always.
- Thank you.

11:35.260 --> 11:37.960
Excuse me.
Hello, are you by any chance...

11:37.996 --> 11:39.762
Katie Hendricks!

11:39.798 --> 11:41.497
I am.

11:41.533 --> 11:44.000
- You must be Princess Patricia.
- How do you do?

11:44.035 --> 11:46.102
Thank you so much
for inviting us backstage.

11:46.137 --> 11:48.838
Of course. And you must be
Princess Christina.

11:48.873 --> 11:51.274
Just Christina.

11:51.309 --> 11:52.809
This is the talented
Jessica Lewis.

11:52.844 --> 11:54.588
- Lovely to meet you.
- Wonderful to meet you.

11:54.612 --> 11:56.846
- Wonderful show.
- Thank you so much.

11:56.881 --> 11:58.526
- It's so nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

11:58.550 --> 11:59.916
Should we curtsy?

11:59.951 --> 12:01.484
I can't believe I'm meeting you.

12:01.519 --> 12:04.153
You're a three-time
world champion.

12:04.189 --> 12:06.823
Didn't you almost
go to the Olympics?

12:06.858 --> 12:08.691
Almost.

12:08.726 --> 12:12.628
But you weren't in the show.
Did you stop skating?

12:12.664 --> 12:14.597
I did.
I just choreograph now.

12:14.632 --> 12:19.135
And by that, she means choreograph,
train, and constantly put out fires.

12:19.170 --> 12:22.004
Jessica, I'm a huge fan.
I love your routines.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.706
Thank you!

12:23.741 --> 12:26.609
I hear you're being coached.
Learning any new tricks?

12:26.644 --> 12:29.111
A spiral.

12:29.147 --> 12:31.347
Well, pro tip:
A good spiral's all about

12:31.382 --> 12:33.015
a great banana position.

12:33.051 --> 12:36.085
Could you show me?
I have a rink at the palace.

12:37.322 --> 12:40.223
You have a rink at the palace.

12:40.258 --> 12:43.159
We could skate.
I could give you a tour.

12:43.194 --> 12:46.229
Well, we were sad that
we missed the public tours.

12:46.264 --> 12:48.698
Well, then you must
come visit us.

12:48.733 --> 12:50.233
This afternoon?

12:50.268 --> 12:51.901
- Yeah, that would be great.
- Lovely!

12:51.936 --> 12:53.035
Thank you.

12:55.006 --> 12:57.573
This is San Senova's
first royal family.

12:57.609 --> 13:00.243
That painting is almost
500 years old.

13:00.278 --> 13:02.311
I actually think
I have that dress.

13:02.347 --> 13:05.915
And this is exactly
like our apartment.

13:05.950 --> 13:09.529
- Really? Where do you live?
- New Jersey.

13:10.263 --> 13:11.554
New Jersey.

13:11.589 --> 13:14.724
Excuse me.
Where's your ladies' room?

13:14.759 --> 13:18.828
It's up the stairs to the right,
third door on the left.

13:19.898 --> 13:21.230
Okay.

13:25.403 --> 13:27.403
Third door on the left.

13:31.476 --> 13:35.511
- You?
- You. What are you doing here?

13:36.748 --> 13:38.381
You're on a tour.

13:38.416 --> 13:41.684
Yeah, I got a little lost.
What are you doing here?

13:41.719 --> 13:45.021
Well, I work here.

13:45.056 --> 13:47.690
You work in the palace,
like for the king?

13:49.227 --> 13:50.660
Something like that.

13:51.963 --> 13:54.530
The king. Cool.

13:54.565 --> 13:55.798
What's he like?

13:57.536 --> 14:01.616
Magnanimous and beloved.
That sort of thing.

14:02.307 --> 14:04.807
Well, I'm sure it's amazing
to work in this palace.

14:04.842 --> 14:06.409
It's gorgeous.

14:06.444 --> 14:08.210
Although between you and me,

14:08.246 --> 14:10.980
I think it could do with a few
extra Christmas decorations.

14:11.015 --> 14:13.649
'Course you would.

14:13.685 --> 14:16.152
Well, I think it's
just perfect as it is.

14:16.187 --> 14:18.387
Of course you do.

14:18.423 --> 14:22.658
So can I help
with where you're headed?

14:22.694 --> 14:26.262
- Thanks, but I'm good.
- Of course you are.

14:35.873 --> 14:37.907
There you are.

14:37.942 --> 14:40.910
- Sorry. I got lost.
- Oh, no need to apologize.

14:40.945 --> 14:44.313
I've lived here my entire life,
and I still get lost.

14:44.349 --> 14:48.150
Now, Christina and Jessica are
at the rink, so I'll take us.

14:54.993 --> 14:56.292
I know.

14:56.327 --> 14:57.760
What?

15:08.072 --> 15:10.673
Christina, this is amazing.

15:14.579 --> 15:16.436
Do you ever put on shows here?

15:16.914 --> 15:17.914
No.

15:18.249 --> 15:22.885
Well, actually, my grandpa
did want to host a show here.

15:22.920 --> 15:26.922
An ice skating pageant
for Founder's Day.

15:36.233 --> 15:39.468
- Daddy.
- I'm sorry I missed dinner.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.837
That's fine,
but I have a question.

15:41.872 --> 15:43.372
Yes?

15:43.407 --> 15:45.407
Do you remember how Grandpa
used to talk about

15:45.443 --> 15:47.643
hosting an ice skating pageant
for Founder's Day?

15:47.678 --> 15:50.546
Yes, the retelling of how
San Senova was founded.

15:50.581 --> 15:53.215
Well, what if we hosted it?

15:54.685 --> 15:56.318
That's a marvelous idea.

15:56.354 --> 15:58.320
We'll start planning
after Christmas.

15:58.356 --> 16:02.524
No, not for next Founder's Day.
For this Founder's Day.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.260
Christina, Founder's Day
is on Christmas Eve,

16:05.296 --> 16:07.162
and that's two weeks away.

16:07.198 --> 16:09.064
A pageant would be
a massive production.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.033
But the figure skating stars
are here.

16:11.068 --> 16:13.936
Katie and Jessica came to the
rink today. They could do it.

16:13.971 --> 16:17.206
And I'll inquire with them
for next Founder's Day.

16:20.277 --> 16:24.012
But, Daddy, then you'll be the
Grinch King for a whole year,

16:24.048 --> 16:27.049
and that's not who you are,
and everyone should know that.

16:31.756 --> 16:32.855
Tina-bear...

16:37.661 --> 16:41.029
I'll talk to this Katie
and Jessica, all right?

16:41.065 --> 16:42.097
Good.

16:44.168 --> 16:46.402
Good night, Tina-bear.
I love you.

16:46.437 --> 16:48.404
I love you too, Daddy.

16:57.415 --> 16:58.447
Bye.

16:58.482 --> 17:00.949
Bye. Merry Christmas.

17:00.985 --> 17:02.918
Miss Hendricks, Miss...

17:04.021 --> 17:06.320
Lewis.

17:06.357 --> 17:08.589
The king has requested
a word with you at the palace.

17:08.626 --> 17:10.992
- We have to catch our flight.
- Don't worry.

17:11.028 --> 17:13.628
We'll make sure
it doesn't leave without you.

17:34.318 --> 17:36.652
Do you think
we're somehow in trouble?

17:36.687 --> 17:40.823
If this is the dungeon,
lock me up.

17:40.858 --> 17:43.091
I can't believe
we're going to meet the king.

17:43.127 --> 17:45.594
Let's just be on
our best behavior.

17:45.629 --> 17:48.096
What, me?

17:48.132 --> 17:51.500
Let's just not offend anyone
or break anything.

17:54.338 --> 17:55.304
Sorry.

17:55.339 --> 17:57.139
Sorry to keep you waiting.

17:58.309 --> 18:00.108
- You?
- You?

18:00.144 --> 18:01.877
What are you doing here?

18:01.912 --> 18:04.580
I'm meeting the...

18:07.651 --> 18:09.952
You're the king.

18:09.987 --> 18:11.587
Should we curtsy?

18:21.700 --> 18:26.803
So you're the Katie and Jessica
that Christina's spoken so highly of.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.806
I'm Katie, and this is Jessica.

18:29.842 --> 18:30.974
Sorry.

18:31.009 --> 18:32.642
Well, nice to see you again.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.377
Shall we get
to the business at hand?

18:34.413 --> 18:36.880
So my daughter
has gotten an idea

18:36.915 --> 18:40.484
to host an ice-skated retelling
of our country's founding.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.991
It'll be performed
on Founder's Day,

18:48.026 --> 18:51.161
which is Christmas Eve,
and it's 13 days from now.

18:51.196 --> 18:54.498
- That's ambitious.
- I think so too.

18:54.533 --> 18:58.869
She would love you both to star
in it, choreograph, and coach.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.671
I know it's a tall order, but
I promised my daughter I'd ask.

19:01.707 --> 19:04.141
However, I understand
how highly illogical

19:04.176 --> 19:05.976
and quite impossible
it all could be.

19:06.011 --> 19:09.012
- We'll do it.
- No.

19:09.047 --> 19:10.981
I'm sorry, we can't.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.217
Well, what's your final answer?

19:14.253 --> 19:16.453
- Yes.
- No.

19:18.891 --> 19:22.025
Skating in a pageant
in a palace.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.894
That's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

19:23.929 --> 19:26.263
To put on a pageant in 13 days?

19:26.298 --> 19:28.698
Plus, we said we'd be home
for Christmas this year.

19:28.734 --> 19:31.168
Yeah, but San Senova's like
walking into a snow globe.

19:31.203 --> 19:34.171
- What could be better than that?
- Being home.

19:34.206 --> 19:36.907
Ladies, if you've
decided to leave,

19:36.942 --> 19:39.509
then a car is waiting
to take you to the airport.

19:39.545 --> 19:44.781
However, if you're still considering,
the Crown's offer for your services.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.516
If you need some more time,

19:46.552 --> 19:49.052
I can simply reschedule
your flight to leave tomorrow.

19:49.087 --> 19:50.698
We've already
checked out of our hotel.

19:50.722 --> 19:52.022
Since you're in San Senova,

19:52.057 --> 19:54.124
you shall be a guest
of the Crown.

19:54.159 --> 19:55.192
Wait.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.695
You mean we'd be staying here?

19:58.730 --> 20:02.599
I wouldn't get too excited.
Gets quite drafty.

20:05.737 --> 20:08.872
He is so cute.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.874
Oh, come on! Don't you wanna
stay at a palace?

20:10.909 --> 20:12.876
No! I wanna stay
in my own bed.

20:12.911 --> 20:15.579
And there's nothing that's gonna
make me wanna change my mind.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.750
What about this?

20:20.786 --> 20:22.552
That's a very generous offer.

20:22.588 --> 20:25.388
Katie, this is the money
that we need for the ice rink.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.727
What exactly does
the pageant entail?

20:31.930 --> 20:33.630
I'll go find out.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.574
So did our guests
reach a decision?

20:44.610 --> 20:46.810
They're still considering, sir.

20:46.845 --> 20:49.813
What is there to consider?
It's a ludicrous concept.

20:49.848 --> 20:52.916
- Produce a pageant in two weeks.
- 13 days.

20:52.951 --> 20:55.652
To say no now
would disappoint Christina,

20:55.687 --> 20:59.756
but the show going awry would be
a much bigger disappointment.

20:59.791 --> 21:01.858
I just know how much
this means to her.

21:01.893 --> 21:03.760
I know you want to protect her,

21:03.795 --> 21:05.629
but what if the show
didn't go awry?

21:12.871 --> 21:14.471
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

21:14.506 --> 21:18.208
I was just looking
for Christina and Patricia.

21:18.243 --> 21:20.210
Oh, well, I can show you.
Follow me.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.045
Okay, thanks.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.048
So have you guys decided whether
you're gonna stay or not?

21:25.083 --> 21:28.118
Not yet, no,
but I'm hoping for yes.

21:28.153 --> 21:29.853
Yeah, me too.

21:29.888 --> 21:33.290
It'd be nice to have you
as a houseguest.

21:34.426 --> 21:37.193
- Yeah, follow me.
- Thanks.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.467
Have you decided to stay?

21:44.503 --> 21:47.137
Not quite yet.
We were hoping to find out

21:47.172 --> 21:49.639
a little bit more about
your vision for the pageant,

21:49.675 --> 21:53.376
about the stories that we'd be
telling, something like that.

21:53.412 --> 21:55.812
Originally,
San Senova wasn't a kingdom,

21:55.847 --> 21:59.816
but it was a large estate
of a wealthy family:

21:59.851 --> 22:02.218
William, Catherine,
and their daughter Sonia.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.654
- Should we sit down?
- Sure.

22:06.692 --> 22:08.725
Well, about 500 years ago,

22:08.760 --> 22:11.361
there was a terrible avalanche
in the kingdom across the lake.

22:11.396 --> 22:12.896
It destroyed a village,

22:12.931 --> 22:14.864
and all the villagers
had to flee their homes.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.700
So when William
found out about this,

22:16.735 --> 22:19.169
he set off with a team
on horseback to rescue them.

22:19.204 --> 22:22.906
Well, when they hadn't
returned after several days,

22:22.941 --> 22:26.543
Catherine and Sonia,
who was about Christina's age,

22:26.578 --> 22:30.013
decided to set off
and find them.

22:30.048 --> 22:33.216
And Sonia and Catherine
skated across the frozen lake

22:33.251 --> 22:35.518
to find William
and the villagers snowed in,

22:35.554 --> 22:37.854
and then they brought them
to the safety of San Senova.

22:37.889 --> 22:40.223
Where they all
celebrated Christmas together.

22:40.258 --> 22:41.925
And they stayed
through the winter,

22:41.960 --> 22:43.693
and in spring,
they didn't want to leave,

22:43.729 --> 22:46.529
so they declared our family
the royal family,

22:46.565 --> 22:49.966
and that is how the kingdom
of San Senova was born.

22:51.470 --> 22:52.902
That's such a beautiful story.

22:52.938 --> 22:54.904
- Isn't it?
- It is.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.573
That's the story we tell
in the pageant.

22:56.608 --> 22:59.542
And then maybe
the pageant would be

22:59.578 --> 23:02.278
a new Christmas tradition
my dad gives the country.

23:02.314 --> 23:05.782
And then everyone would stop
calling him the Grinch King

23:05.817 --> 23:08.918
because he's not
a Grinch at all.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.054
He's not who people think he is.

23:11.089 --> 23:14.224
He's funny and nice
and the best dad,

23:14.259 --> 23:16.059
and everyone should know that.

23:16.094 --> 23:18.261
And maybe the pageant
could remind him

23:18.296 --> 23:19.562
how much he loves Christmas,

23:19.598 --> 23:22.599
and then he'll do
Christmas stuff.

23:22.634 --> 23:24.300
You don't do Christmas stuff?

23:24.336 --> 23:28.638
In the past few years, the
palace's Christmas festivities

23:28.673 --> 23:31.574
have been, well,
more for formality's sake.

23:31.610 --> 23:35.678
Photo ops and a very stuffy
traditional Christmas Eve dinner.

23:35.714 --> 23:39.983
You don't decorate a Christmas
tree or bake Christmas cookies?

23:40.018 --> 23:43.753
We used to do that
with my grandfather.

23:48.460 --> 23:49.492
Come on.

23:54.733 --> 23:58.768
See? Christina just wants
a real Christmas,

23:58.804 --> 24:00.904
like somebody else I know.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.346
With plum pudding
all over his face!

24:12.050 --> 24:15.852
Girls, we're having a formal dinner
tonight for the visiting dignitaries,

24:15.887 --> 24:18.087
so we've put some dresses
in your rooms.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.290
Thank you!

24:21.259 --> 24:22.692
Your room, Madam.

24:24.529 --> 24:25.829
Good day, Madam.

24:39.744 --> 24:43.446
Can we stay here forever?

24:43.482 --> 24:48.952
No, but we can stay
until the pageant.

25:27.659 --> 25:31.561
- You look... different.
- Thank you.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.300
So I heard you're staying
for the pageant.

25:37.335 --> 25:40.136
I hope you don't mind me asking,
what made you change your mind?

25:40.171 --> 25:42.639
Christina can be
very persuasive.

25:42.674 --> 25:44.474
That, she can.

25:44.509 --> 25:47.777
And your generous offer
didn't hurt either.

25:47.812 --> 25:50.446
Christina loves figure skating
more than anything,

25:50.482 --> 25:53.917
and I love the joy and magic
it brings to an audience.

25:53.952 --> 25:55.919
We all deserve a real Christmas.

25:55.954 --> 25:58.855
I'm not sure what you mean,

25:58.890 --> 26:01.891
but something tells me
I'm going to find out.

26:03.194 --> 26:04.494
Shall we?

26:09.869 --> 26:11.702
Okay, I've choreographed
some simple numbers

26:11.737 --> 26:13.904
we'll weave through San Senova's
founding story.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.706
Perfect.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.876
I will start on costumes,
crew, props, sets,

26:18.911 --> 26:21.311
and you're on casting
and scheduling rehearsals?

26:21.347 --> 26:25.015
Yeah. I have tryouts for the
villagers starting in one hour.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.517
And you're gonna play the queen?

26:26.552 --> 26:28.652
Well, of course.
I was born for the role.

26:28.687 --> 26:31.688
And it'll be fun to skate with Christina.
I assume she's playing the princess.

26:31.724 --> 26:35.626
Patricia actually said that Christina
wanted to hold tryouts for Sonia.

26:37.062 --> 26:39.407
I guess Christina
just wants to be fair.

26:39.488 --> 26:41.165
That's sweet.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.668
Okay, so I'm going
to head into town

26:44.703 --> 26:47.704
to work on the set decor
and costumes.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.706
Okay, I'm heading to the rink.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.275
See? We're doing this.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.211
12 days? No problem.
We'll get this thing done.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.113
It is the season of miracles.

26:56.148 --> 26:59.549
Also, I talked to the real estate
broker who's finding us the rink.

26:59.585 --> 27:00.795
She's starting
to put out feelers.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.119
Exciting.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.788
Katie, Jessica,

27:04.823 --> 27:08.258
I wanted to offer my assistance
in organizing the pageant,

27:08.293 --> 27:10.260
- however I can help.
- Thank you.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.729
I've always had a penchant
for musical theater,

27:12.765 --> 27:16.600
and this seems pretty much
the same, only colder, on ice.

27:19.738 --> 27:22.372
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.875
The king's asked me to organize
an ice skating pageant

27:24.910 --> 27:26.410
for Founder's Day,

27:26.445 --> 27:27.622
I was wondering
if it would be possible

27:27.646 --> 27:29.079
to rent set decorations
from you.

27:29.114 --> 27:31.815
No need to rent.
We'll be happy to donate.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.917
- Really?
- Of course.

27:33.952 --> 27:35.285
Great.

27:42.027 --> 27:44.661
Your Majesty.

27:44.696 --> 27:47.931
- What brings you here?
- Pageant prep. You?

27:47.966 --> 27:50.400
- I'm just running errands.
- Kings run errands?

27:50.436 --> 27:52.102
Not typically,

27:52.137 --> 27:54.971
but I came to pick up
the Christmas presents

27:55.007 --> 27:57.407
for the palace staff.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.109
That's really sweet of you.

27:59.144 --> 28:02.079
You don't have to look
so surprised.

28:03.115 --> 28:04.948
What are you getting everyone?

28:04.983 --> 28:07.584
A specially-made card
and a monetary gift.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.853
You're getting the staff money?

28:09.888 --> 28:12.689
Well, it's traditional
and practical.

28:12.724 --> 28:14.858
It sounds like a generous gift,

28:14.893 --> 28:17.360
but maybe you should consider
adding a personal touch.

28:17.396 --> 28:21.398
Well, I appreciate
your unsolicited advice.

28:22.734 --> 28:24.301
I should run.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.469
Thank you.

28:25.504 --> 28:26.570
Good day.

28:29.908 --> 28:34.845
Do you think that my gift
could be perceived as...

28:34.880 --> 28:35.979
impersonal?

29:05.244 --> 29:08.478
Aunt Patricia,
have you seen Christina?

29:08.514 --> 29:11.148
She finished her homework
and ran off to the rink.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.684
Thank you.

29:35.207 --> 29:38.108
You were amazing!
That was great.

29:38.143 --> 29:40.410
Why weren't you at tryouts?

29:40.445 --> 29:43.914
Because I don't want
to play Princess Sonia.

29:52.157 --> 29:53.356
Why not?

29:53.392 --> 29:56.393
I guess everyone
will be watching,

29:56.428 --> 29:59.462
and what if I mess up?

29:59.498 --> 30:01.531
Everyone messes up sometimes.

30:04.169 --> 30:05.735
Back when I was skating,

30:05.771 --> 30:08.205
I used to be so worried
about messing up my jumps.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.706
But my mom,
who was also my coach,

30:09.741 --> 30:11.319
would always remind me
that in competition,

30:11.343 --> 30:13.043
you get points for trying.

30:13.078 --> 30:14.544
It doesn't matter if you fall.

30:16.039 --> 30:16.947
And she would also tell me,

30:16.982 --> 30:20.650
and I really wish I had listened
to her while I was skating,

30:20.686 --> 30:22.719
it doesn't matter
if you mess up.

30:22.754 --> 30:25.288
All that matters is that
you love being out on the ice.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.791
And I hate to typecast you,

30:27.826 --> 30:29.659
but you're an incredible
skating princess,

30:29.695 --> 30:32.996
and the pageant needs
an incredible skating princess.

30:33.031 --> 30:35.665
And you'll be
coaching the skaters?

30:35.701 --> 30:38.468
Yeah. We'll have lots of time
to work together.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.403
So?

30:43.342 --> 30:46.810
- Okay.
- Yes! High-five!

30:46.845 --> 30:49.679
I'm not sure princesses
are suppose to high-five.

30:49.715 --> 30:51.214
Okay. Low-five?

30:53.552 --> 30:55.652
Shall we start with your spiral?

31:01.793 --> 31:04.594
How's the planning?

31:04.630 --> 31:09.332
Well, despite being highly illogical
and quite impossible, it's going well.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.567
Good.

31:12.571 --> 31:15.972
I overheard you at the ice rink
earlier with Christina.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.943
- I hope I didn't overstep.
- No, not at all...

31:21.980 --> 31:23.546
Thanks.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.382
Actually, I wanted to thank you.

31:25.417 --> 31:30.453
She can be tough on herself
and take herself too seriously.

31:32.190 --> 31:33.723
It's been hard for her.

31:33.759 --> 31:36.293
She lost her mother
six years ago

31:36.328 --> 31:38.695
and her grandfather
three years ago.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.330
And she knows that
despite being a child,

31:40.365 --> 31:43.867
everyone sees her
as the person who will be queen.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.169
I just know that skating
is truly the place

31:46.204 --> 31:49.306
where she can just be herself.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.174
I understand that feeling.

31:53.278 --> 31:54.744
Well, thank you.

31:54.780 --> 31:58.648
You know, she's putting
this pageant on for you.

31:58.684 --> 32:02.852
I had my suspicions, with
the whole Grinch King fiasco.

32:02.888 --> 32:05.388
Yeah. She thinks
you're pretty great,

32:05.424 --> 32:08.491
wants everyone else to know too.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.660
But I think she also hopes

32:10.696 --> 32:13.163
this pageant will remind you
how much you love Christmas

32:13.198 --> 32:15.765
and then get you
into the holiday spirit.

32:15.801 --> 32:18.368
Well, I'll give it some thought.

32:18.403 --> 32:23.006
And as ever, I appreciate
your unsolicited advice.

32:23.439 --> 32:26.743
- Good night, Katie.
- Good night, Your Majesty.

32:27.879 --> 32:29.312
Just Alex.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.581
Good night, Alex.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.532
The guest list
for the Christmas Eve dinner.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.869
The Christmas Eve royal dinner.

32:51.904 --> 32:54.538
Reigning contender
for the worst night of the year.

32:54.573 --> 32:57.741
I wouldn't say contender, sir,
I'd say the heavyweight champion.

32:57.777 --> 32:59.688
You know, it was tolerable
when my father hosted it.

32:59.712 --> 33:01.979
Now it's unbearably stuffy.

33:03.683 --> 33:05.883
By the way,
I need you to reschedule

33:05.918 --> 33:08.852
my afternoon meeting
with the chancellor,

33:08.888 --> 33:11.221
I have a surprise planned
for Christina.

33:14.527 --> 33:16.160
The seamstress
is working on costumes,

33:16.195 --> 33:18.662
the set decorations
should be delivered today.

33:18.698 --> 33:21.065
The set designers
start tomorrow.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.545
Great, and I'd love to set up a
meeting with the lighting crew.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.002
I'll arrange that.

33:25.037 --> 33:27.071
And let me know anything else
I can help with.

33:27.106 --> 33:31.175
- Thank you so much.
- No, thank you.

33:31.210 --> 33:36.547
It's not often we get to have
this much fun around here.

33:37.155 --> 33:40.350
Don't worry. Everyone falls down.
Even me. All the time.

33:40.386 --> 33:44.321
I promise you're gonna get it.
Just takes a little bit of practice.

33:47.660 --> 33:50.961
- She's having trouble with her spiral.
- She's hard on herself.

33:50.996 --> 33:54.131
Yeah, well, she reminds me
of somebody else I know.

33:54.166 --> 33:57.316
I have to head to rehearsal
for the villagers.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.110
Christina, you're doing great.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.678
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.280
But there are only
10 days until the pageant,

34:10.315 --> 34:13.417
and I still haven't got
the spiral perfect.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.552
And everyone's going
to be watching.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.330
Tina-bear.

34:19.891 --> 34:20.937
Daddy.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.960
Hey.

34:22.995 --> 34:25.429
- What are you doing here?
- Well, last night,

34:25.464 --> 34:28.132
I was thinking of something
your grandfather had said.

34:28.167 --> 34:31.368
That in a palace
filled with Christmas trees,

34:31.402 --> 34:34.804
we must have decorated one
ourselves.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.951
You mean we're going to
decorate a Christmas tree.

34:37.074 --> 34:40.643
- We need to pick one out first.
- Yes! Can Katie come?

34:42.380 --> 34:47.684
Well, I'm sure Katie's quite busy,
but if she can spare an hour,

34:47.719 --> 34:50.387
we could certainly
use your Christmas expertise.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.489
Christmas is my middle name.

34:52.525 --> 34:55.793
Then you must join us because
my middle name is William.

34:59.398 --> 35:01.698
This one, this one, this one!
Can we get that one?

35:03.102 --> 35:05.202
No, no, this one.
I really like this one.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.671
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.543
This is turning into
a photo op for you.

35:12.578 --> 35:15.312
My life is one long
photo opportunity.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.181
The joys of being king.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.183
Don't have to tell me.
I was prom queen.

35:19.218 --> 35:22.386
I think I found it.
I think I found the perfect tree.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.389
This is the one.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.024
It is perfect.

35:28.861 --> 35:30.994
I'll ask Nicholas
to organize delivery.

35:33.199 --> 35:36.099
- What?
- Well, my family tradition is

35:36.135 --> 35:37.701
no Christmas tree shopping
is complete

35:37.736 --> 35:41.104
without struggling to get
the Christmas tree home.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.906
Really?

35:45.411 --> 35:49.012
Careful!
That was nearly the last of me.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.852
Okay, be careful.

35:56.088 --> 35:58.121
There? Okay.
Like here?

35:58.157 --> 36:00.090
- Yeah.
- It's beautiful.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.358
Okay.

36:02.328 --> 36:05.429
- Hot chocolate?
- Oh, honey, thank you.

36:05.464 --> 36:09.233
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.268
I just love this one.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.980
Why did I get this job?

36:23.015 --> 36:25.415
I think I assumed,
since you rule a country,

36:25.451 --> 36:28.051
you could probably untangle
some Christmas lights.

36:28.087 --> 36:31.421
Well, I've once more
proved you wrong.

36:33.592 --> 36:36.727
First, the struggle with
the Christmas tree home,

36:36.762 --> 36:38.662
and now the lights.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.297
Christmas should come
with a warning.

36:40.332 --> 36:43.000
Yes, warning.
Fun ahead.

36:43.035 --> 36:46.503
- Do you want some help?
- Yes, please.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.250
Some of these ornaments
are hundreds of years old.

36:48.274 --> 36:51.742
Then I probably
shouldn't touch them.

36:51.777 --> 36:54.945
I'm not used to Christmas trees
having so much history.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.080
Well, I'm used to being
surrounded by history.

36:57.116 --> 36:59.249
My family's always
worked for the Crown.

36:59.285 --> 37:03.353
My father assisted Alex's father.
My grandfather, his grandfather.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.689
You gotta keep untangling it.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.158
I think it would look
really good around you.

37:09.495 --> 37:10.705
We grew up together
like brothers.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.195
So was working at the palace

37:12.231 --> 37:14.331
something you always knew
you wanted to do?

37:14.366 --> 37:16.700
There was never any question
of doing anything else.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.635
I mean, it's a wonderful job.

37:18.671 --> 37:22.205
Sometimes I get to sit on the throne
when no one's looking.

37:24.643 --> 37:27.377
What about you? Did you always
know you wanted to skate?

37:27.413 --> 37:30.714
I did actually, yeah.
And so did Katie.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.951
We met when we were three.
We grew up on the ice together.

37:33.986 --> 37:36.153
All we ever dreamed about
was skating

37:36.188 --> 37:38.712
and competing and performing.

37:39.058 --> 37:41.525
And now we have a new dream.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.360
I wanna buy an ice rink,

37:43.395 --> 37:46.463
start a training center
where we can coach skaters.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.899
I love to skate, but I could
always use some coaching,

37:48.934 --> 37:51.835
if you need the practice.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.473
Or we could do something else.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.976
I could take you
on a tour of San Senova.

38:00.412 --> 38:01.778
I'd love that.

38:03.215 --> 38:05.816
- Let's have a look.
- It looks great.

38:05.851 --> 38:08.051
- Well done.
- It looks so beautiful.

38:08.087 --> 38:12.189
- Looks very nice, guys.
- Look at the star.

38:12.224 --> 38:14.491
It's twinkling.
Should we take a photo?

38:19.898 --> 38:22.265
Miss Hendricks,
you're needed at the rink.

38:22.301 --> 38:25.769
- What's wrong?
- Jessica's hurt.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.505
I've already called
the palace doctor.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.207
Yeah, it's fine in there.

38:30.242 --> 38:31.341
The outside's where it's...

38:31.377 --> 38:33.777
- What happened?
- I slipped and fell wrong.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.179
She'll be fine.
It's just a bad sprain.

38:36.215 --> 38:37.726
Walking will be fine
in a couple of days,

38:37.750 --> 38:41.952
but no skating
for at least three weeks.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.286
- Three weeks?
- Three weeks?

38:43.322 --> 38:45.188
But the pageant's in nine days.

38:50.396 --> 38:52.696
Katie, you know
the choreography,

38:52.731 --> 38:55.198
and you will skate it
better than I ever could.

38:55.234 --> 38:58.402
I can't.
I have my old injury.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.972
And I haven't been
on the ice in years.

39:03.509 --> 39:06.510
We'll figure it out.
This country is full of ice skaters.

39:06.545 --> 39:11.181
We'll find someone to replace you.
I'll hold tryouts.

39:11.216 --> 39:13.550
Right, because you've
got nothing better to do.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.819
I have few things I need to do.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.321
Well, not to add to your list,

39:18.357 --> 39:21.491
but I heard from the real
estate broker this morning.

39:21.527 --> 39:23.326
We have some forms
we have to fill out,

39:23.362 --> 39:25.762
and she told me that
there might be an ice rink

39:25.798 --> 39:27.064
in Trenton going up for sale.

39:27.099 --> 39:28.665
It's like
a half-an-hour from us.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.367
Don't know why
we've never seen it.

39:30.402 --> 39:33.770
I haven't seen pictures yet,
but it sounds perfect.

39:33.806 --> 39:35.038
That's great.

39:38.277 --> 39:40.844
I hope I'm not interrupting.

39:40.879 --> 39:44.948
I brought you some flowers.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.616
Thank you.

39:46.652 --> 39:50.020
Beautiful flowers
for a beautiful lady.

39:52.391 --> 39:56.259
- How is your ankle?
- It's feeling a lot better, thank you.

39:56.295 --> 39:58.728
- Brilliant. Great.
- Thank you.

39:58.764 --> 40:01.965
I'll leave you two alone,
and I'll catch you later.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.533
Okay.

40:05.604 --> 40:09.139
- What's going on with you two?
- Nothing.

40:09.174 --> 40:12.876
But he is handsome.
And odd, but in the best way.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.779
And he's really smart.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.982
- And?
- And I'm leaving soon.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.795
Well, you never know
how things will work out.

40:20.819 --> 40:22.586
Remember what my mom
used to say?

40:22.621 --> 40:25.388
"Christmas is a time
where we open our hearts".

40:25.424 --> 40:29.259
Oh, well, you know,
maybe you should open yours...

40:29.294 --> 40:31.461
to skating in the pageant.

40:36.034 --> 40:39.669
Could you help schedule tryouts
for the queen role tomorrow?

40:39.705 --> 40:42.005
Christina needs to skate with
someone as soon as possible.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.241
- Happy to help.
- Thank you.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.976
Excuse me.

40:48.380 --> 40:49.479
Aunt Patricia.

40:51.350 --> 40:54.084
I'm so sorry
to hear about Jessica.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.786
- Thank you.
- I'll just...

41:01.193 --> 41:04.361
The pageant being illogical
and impossible

41:04.396 --> 41:06.129
is growing increasingly real.

41:07.199 --> 41:08.999
Well, I have faith in you.

41:09.034 --> 41:11.168
And actually,
I have a little matter

41:11.203 --> 41:13.370
I could use your advice on.

41:13.405 --> 41:17.974
I've reconsidered your take
on the palace staff Christmas gifts.

41:18.010 --> 41:20.477
- You did, did you?
- I did.

41:20.512 --> 41:23.880
And I could see how my gift
could be perceived as...

41:23.916 --> 41:25.682
Bad?

41:25.717 --> 41:28.818
I was going to say
"unsentimental", but...

41:28.854 --> 41:30.520
That's the word
I was looking for.

41:30.556 --> 41:32.222
I know you've got
a lot on your plate,

41:32.257 --> 41:35.358
and heaven knows nobody needs
this pageant to succeed

41:35.394 --> 41:37.794
more than the Grinch King.

41:37.829 --> 41:41.965
I was hoping you could help
with some pointers

41:42.000 --> 41:44.134
on my gift giving.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.536
I would love to.

41:46.572 --> 41:49.172
For the palace staff,
the kitchen crew,

41:49.208 --> 41:51.875
Regina, Margaret, Dawson.

41:54.713 --> 41:58.248
- Perhaps a coffee cup for Dawson.
- Does he drink a lot of coffee?

41:58.283 --> 41:59.883
No, he doesn't.

41:59.918 --> 42:02.152
Help. I'm failing Christmas.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.888
Okay, well,
everyone who knows me

42:04.923 --> 42:06.590
knows how much I love
Christmas ornaments.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.225
I have a collection,

42:08.260 --> 42:10.004
although I'm never home
to hang them on the tree.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.262
But, as gifts,
I receive a lot of ornaments

42:12.297 --> 42:14.531
with personal significance,
and I love them.

42:14.566 --> 42:18.235
So I get the staff ornaments?

42:19.171 --> 42:20.771
I think the key is
to give something

42:20.806 --> 42:24.074
that tells everyone the place
they have in your heart.

42:26.579 --> 42:29.713
Okay, let's see
what we can find.

42:31.851 --> 42:34.718
I'll take one of these.

42:34.753 --> 42:37.020
Two of these.
Here, hold that.

42:37.056 --> 42:39.723
I'm sorry,
but the gift is socks?

42:39.758 --> 42:43.293
Aren't socks considered universally
the worst Christmas gifts?

42:43.329 --> 42:46.063
Not socks.
Christmas stockings.

42:46.098 --> 42:48.065
You'll hand-make them
for the staff,

42:48.100 --> 42:49.967
and we'll hang them
above the fireplace.

42:50.002 --> 42:53.871
You can fill them with the cards
and the personal gifts

42:53.906 --> 42:56.306
to show them how much you care.

42:57.776 --> 43:00.677
I'm still struggling
with the hand-make part.

43:00.713 --> 43:02.145
I'll help you.

43:02.181 --> 43:04.748
Okay, I'll sew, you decorate.

43:04.783 --> 43:07.851
Well, it definitely won't be
the other way around.

43:07.887 --> 43:09.519
How do you know
how to do all this?

43:09.555 --> 43:10.888
I used to do it with my mom.

43:10.923 --> 43:14.892
She loved Christmas, went all out.
Everything handmade, DIY.

43:16.395 --> 43:19.062
My mother passed away
when I was very young.

43:19.098 --> 43:20.831
I never really knew her.

43:20.866 --> 43:24.735
But my father,
he loved Christmas.

43:24.770 --> 43:28.405
Sounds like a great guy already.
What was he like?

43:28.440 --> 43:30.674
Magnanimous, beloved.

43:30.709 --> 43:32.843
I feel like I've heard that
somewhere before.

43:32.878 --> 43:35.846
Often it was actually true
with him.

43:35.881 --> 43:38.515
I'm not quite the king
that he was.

43:39.485 --> 43:42.619
- You miss him.
- Yeah, I do.

43:42.655 --> 43:46.023
All the time,
especially at Christmas.

43:46.058 --> 43:47.925
I get that.

43:47.960 --> 43:51.595
The first couple Christmases
after my mom passed away,

43:51.630 --> 43:54.598
every garland and carol
reminded me of her.

43:54.633 --> 43:57.134
It was hard.

43:57.169 --> 44:01.838
But now Christmas has become
a way of celebrating her memory.

44:09.615 --> 44:11.915
- Shall we?
- Okay.

44:23.629 --> 44:29.032
Sorry they're late,
but some good press.

44:34.006 --> 44:37.074
Katie is rather something.

44:38.177 --> 44:39.876
Yes, I suppose.

44:41.113 --> 44:45.649
Alex, it is okay
to get close to someone again.

44:45.684 --> 44:47.851
I know losing Victoria
was hard...

44:47.886 --> 44:51.021
Nicholas...

44:51.056 --> 44:55.192
the menu the kitchen sent over
for the Christmas Eve dinner.

44:55.227 --> 44:56.526
Yes.

44:56.562 --> 45:00.664
Can you pass it along to Patricia
and ask if she'll handle it?

45:01.667 --> 45:03.667
Yes, Your Majesty.

45:26.925 --> 45:27.958
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:27.993 --> 45:29.693
How's it going?

45:29.728 --> 45:33.196
Well, given there's a week until
Christmas, better than expected.

45:33.232 --> 45:36.700
- Do you want to sit?
- Yeah, sure.

45:36.735 --> 45:38.035
How's the ankle?

45:38.070 --> 45:40.037
It's healing well.
Walking is fine.

45:40.072 --> 45:44.875
It's just bad timing with the pageant
and having to find a replacement.

45:44.910 --> 45:47.377
- And what about you?
- I'm ready for something new.

45:47.413 --> 45:50.747
- The training center.
- What about you?

45:50.783 --> 45:53.016
Do you think you'll stay
at the palace forever?

45:53.052 --> 45:55.152
I'm not quite sure
what else I'd do.

45:55.187 --> 45:56.820
What else would you want to do?

45:56.855 --> 45:58.688
But I've lived in San Senova
my whole life,

45:58.724 --> 46:02.192
so maybe go somewhere different,
try something new,

46:02.227 --> 46:03.527
throw caution to the wind.

46:03.562 --> 46:05.595
You know, have an adventure.

46:07.466 --> 46:09.032
Sounds exciting.

46:11.637 --> 46:13.870
Speaking of adventure,

46:13.906 --> 46:16.239
didn't you promise me
a tour of San Senova?

46:16.275 --> 46:19.776
I'm not quite sure it's
an adventure, but yes, I did.

46:19.812 --> 46:21.578
Tomorrow?

46:21.613 --> 46:22.712
It's a date.

46:22.748 --> 46:24.681
Great.

46:42.768 --> 46:44.568
Christina?

46:44.603 --> 46:46.903
We're supposed to be rehearsing.

46:46.905 --> 46:49.940
Jessica's replacement's
coming to practice with you.

46:49.975 --> 46:52.309
Well...

46:52.344 --> 46:54.144
What's going on?

46:54.179 --> 46:56.446
I don't want to play
Princess Sonia anymore.

47:04.256 --> 47:08.291
When I was skating with Jessica,
she's the star.

47:08.327 --> 47:10.961
I knew everyone
would be looking at her.

47:10.996 --> 47:14.498
But now everyone
will be looking at me,

47:14.533 --> 47:17.000
and they'll expect me
to be perfect.

47:17.035 --> 47:19.169
Why would they expect that?

47:19.204 --> 47:23.807
Because princesses
are supposed to be perfect.

47:23.842 --> 47:26.409
Like Cinderella.

47:26.445 --> 47:28.011
No one's perfect.

47:28.046 --> 47:31.081
And Cinderella
definitely wasn't perfect.

47:31.116 --> 47:32.983
She was always running late
and losing things,

47:33.018 --> 47:34.985
like the glass slipper.

47:35.020 --> 47:37.787
It's one thing
I'll never understand.

47:37.823 --> 47:41.124
If that slipper fit perfectly,
then why did it fall off?

47:43.028 --> 47:45.195
And Cinderella
was a terrible figure skater.

47:45.230 --> 47:47.097
She was?

47:47.132 --> 47:50.133
How could she not be?
Her coach was a pumpkin.

47:55.707 --> 48:01.235
Sometimes it's just a little hard
being out there on the ice.

48:02.414 --> 48:06.550
It is.
But I think that's part of it.

48:06.585 --> 48:11.955
We can't let our fears hold us back
from doing what we love most.

48:16.562 --> 48:18.595
What if I were to skate
the queen role?

48:19.665 --> 48:22.499
- You'd skate with me?
- Yeah.

48:22.534 --> 48:25.902
But aren't you hurt?

48:25.938 --> 48:28.205
Well, let's just hope
I'm all healed up.

48:41.155 --> 48:43.022
San Senova is so beautiful.

48:43.073 --> 48:45.324
You should come back in summer
when everything's in bloom.

48:45.860 --> 48:49.228
- I'll take you to the mountains.
- I'd like that.

48:51.399 --> 48:54.500
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

48:57.438 --> 48:59.105
Apologies.

48:59.140 --> 49:00.740
No, it's okay.

49:05.914 --> 49:10.082
He's so sweet and so hilarious,
and he just...

49:10.118 --> 49:12.084
he just makes me feel
all fluttery.

49:13.421 --> 49:16.756
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thanks.

49:16.791 --> 49:19.659
And not to change the subject
because I do want to hear everything,

49:19.694 --> 49:21.605
but I did sign the forms
that we need to send back

49:21.629 --> 49:22.595
to the real estate broker.

49:22.630 --> 49:24.263
Perfect, okay.

49:24.299 --> 49:26.566
Excuse me, ladies.

49:28.202 --> 49:31.237
I would like to invite you
to the royal Christmas tea

49:31.272 --> 49:33.072
tomorrow afternoon.

49:33.107 --> 49:34.974
It's an age-old tradition.

49:35.009 --> 49:39.745
We'll have tea, finger sandwiches,
and traditional Christmas desserts.

49:39.781 --> 49:42.114
My father and I used
to bake cookies for it.

49:42.150 --> 49:44.617
Maybe that's something
Christina would love to do.

49:44.652 --> 49:47.687
- Well, I'm not much of a baker.
- Well, Katie's a great baker.

49:49.924 --> 49:51.401
Yeah, she used to make
these delicious

49:51.425 --> 49:54.026
frosted gingerbread cookies
with her mom,

49:54.061 --> 49:55.527
and I'm sure she'd love to help.

49:55.563 --> 49:57.763
I know you're very busy, Katie,

49:57.798 --> 50:02.368
but if you could spare the time,
I'm sure Christina would love it.

50:02.403 --> 50:04.536
Anything for Christina.

50:04.572 --> 50:07.473
Very well.
Good afternoon.

50:11.946 --> 50:15.714
- What was that?
- That? That was awkward.

50:15.750 --> 50:17.750
No, he's not interested.

50:19.220 --> 50:22.888
I have seen him looking at you,
and yes, he is.

50:22.924 --> 50:25.891
No, Jessica, he's not.
He dates...

50:26.027 --> 50:28.160
I don't know who he dates,
but not people like me.

50:28.195 --> 50:30.863
Why is it that you always think
you're not good enough?

50:30.898 --> 50:32.664
I don't.
I think I'm great.

50:32.700 --> 50:34.466
- Good.
- But he's a king who's here,

50:34.502 --> 50:36.168
- and I'm...
- Also here right now.

50:36.203 --> 50:38.003
And as you pointed out earlier,
leaving.

50:38.039 --> 50:42.374
What was that thing that your
mom used to say about Christmas?

50:42.410 --> 50:44.476
That it's a time when
you should open your heart.

50:44.512 --> 50:47.579
And I opened my heart
to skating in the pageant.

50:47.615 --> 50:51.016
Speaking of, I should go
rehearse with Christina.

50:51.052 --> 50:53.352
It's my first time
on the ice in years.

50:53.387 --> 50:55.487
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

50:56.457 --> 50:57.790
Nice. Good job, Laney.

51:00.895 --> 51:02.661
Good, Samantha.

51:05.966 --> 51:10.569
High. Pick up your feet.
Seth, pick up your feet a bit.

51:15.276 --> 51:16.383
Are you ready?

51:17.945 --> 51:20.412
You know...

51:22.283 --> 51:25.784
Actually, your dad wanted us
to make Christmas cookies,

51:25.820 --> 51:27.531
so why don't I get everything
ready in the kitchen,

51:27.555 --> 51:30.222
and you can rehearse
with the other kids.

51:30.257 --> 51:31.590
But I don't know them.

51:31.625 --> 51:35.661
Then show them who you really are
because everyone likes that person.

51:37.231 --> 51:39.598
I know it can be scary
to put yourself out there,

51:39.633 --> 51:42.101
but it's worth it.

51:50.578 --> 51:52.411
And then David with the hat
said, "Yay".

51:52.446 --> 51:54.458
And then the other kids
invited me to carol with them

51:54.482 --> 51:56.215
at the Christmas Market
on Friday.

51:56.250 --> 52:01.053
- Can I go?
- Yeah, of course you can, honey.

52:01.088 --> 52:04.990
We'll perform on Friday at 3:00.
Katie, can you come?

52:05.025 --> 52:07.159
Yeah, definitely.

52:07.194 --> 52:10.362
Dad, can you?

52:12.666 --> 52:14.099
I'll try my best.

52:18.939 --> 52:22.407
So I'm stirring, your dad
is still rolling out the dough,

52:22.443 --> 52:25.477
although why it's taking him
so long is a great mystery.

52:25.513 --> 52:27.446
Well, I'm trying
to get it perfect.

52:27.481 --> 52:30.682
It's a sugar cookie, not an
amendment to the Constitution.

52:30.718 --> 52:33.185
My mom used to say no matter
how good the cookie looks,

52:33.220 --> 52:35.420
you should always taste it
just to make sure.

52:35.456 --> 52:38.757
Well, a job that important
definitely needs all of us.

52:40.060 --> 52:41.627
Thank you very much.

52:41.662 --> 52:44.997
Thank you. Cheers.

52:45.032 --> 52:46.431
Cheers.

53:15.229 --> 53:18.297
Thank you for the baking lesson.

53:18.332 --> 53:20.832
- It was marvelous.
- For me too.

53:20.868 --> 53:25.204
It's been a long time
since I baked Christmas cookies.

53:25.239 --> 53:29.975
So are you enjoying yourself, or
does the question need not be asked?

53:30.010 --> 53:34.213
- It's very well-organized.
- It is.

53:34.248 --> 53:38.517
You know, it could do with
a little bit more holiday cheer.

53:38.552 --> 53:41.386
You should come to the
Christmas Eve black tie dinner.

53:41.422 --> 53:44.189
In comparison,
this is a carnival.

53:44.225 --> 53:45.691
I'm confused.

53:45.726 --> 53:47.237
If your father
loved Christmas so much,

53:47.261 --> 53:52.231
then why is it so...
not festive?

53:52.266 --> 53:55.901
My father was the one
who made these events festive.

53:55.936 --> 53:58.422
- He enjoyed the gatherings.
- You don't?

53:59.940 --> 54:02.874
Not so much.

54:02.910 --> 54:05.043
Maybe you should start
your own traditions.

54:05.079 --> 54:06.912
New traditions.

54:08.115 --> 54:10.215
Speaking of new traditions,

54:10.251 --> 54:12.417
I have something
I want to show you.

54:12.453 --> 54:14.419
Does it mean we get to leave?

54:14.455 --> 54:15.754
Yes.

54:21.962 --> 54:23.462
Here we are.

54:24.965 --> 54:26.932
For Regina, my driver,

54:26.967 --> 54:29.601
a cashmere scarf
and some driving gloves.

54:29.637 --> 54:30.969
That's perfect.

54:31.005 --> 54:33.372
And then for Margaret,
the head chef,

54:33.407 --> 54:36.808
a set of antique serving spoons
she's always admired.

54:36.844 --> 54:38.510
That's a great idea.

54:41.582 --> 54:42.948
Thank you so much.

54:47.488 --> 54:49.154
Okay, you...

54:49.189 --> 54:53.458
- They look cozy.
- They sure do.

54:53.494 --> 54:55.527
All right.

55:56.657 --> 55:57.689
Hello.

55:58.325 --> 56:00.459
What has you awake at this hour?

56:00.494 --> 56:03.662
I couldn't sleep. Thought
I'd make some hot chocolate.

56:05.165 --> 56:09.434
Curing insomnia
with sugar and caffeine?

56:11.905 --> 56:14.639
I can ask the staff to help.

56:14.675 --> 56:17.743
No, I'm perfectly capable
of boiling milk and chocolate.

56:17.778 --> 56:20.979
So you're sure don't need
any help at all?

56:22.182 --> 56:24.216
Maybe a little.

56:27.020 --> 56:30.355
So do you often have chocolate
in the middle of the night?

56:30.391 --> 56:33.992
Well, I figure chocolate
comes from cocoa,

56:34.027 --> 56:36.228
which comes from a tree,
which makes it a plant,

56:36.263 --> 56:38.096
which means
I'm kind of having a salad.

56:38.098 --> 56:41.500
I like your logic.
Can you keep a secret?

56:41.535 --> 56:43.702
I keep a stash of candy
in my office.

56:43.737 --> 56:45.704
Oh, a state secret.

56:49.143 --> 56:53.545
So the pageant's in five days,
and then you go home?

56:56.116 --> 56:57.916
I do.

56:57.951 --> 57:00.452
Although...

57:00.487 --> 57:02.921
What?

57:02.956 --> 57:06.892
I guess I've been
in such a big rush to get home,

57:06.927 --> 57:11.930
but lately I've realized why I spent
the past four years on the road.

57:11.965 --> 57:16.902
To me, home is where my mom was,
especially at Christmas.

57:16.937 --> 57:19.871
I guess I'm not so sure if going home
is actually gonna feel like home.

57:22.176 --> 57:23.575
I mean, back in New Jersey,

57:23.610 --> 57:26.478
I have a lot of people I love...
friends, family.

57:26.513 --> 57:27.879
A beau?

57:29.616 --> 57:34.052
- No, no beau.
- Oh, no...

57:34.087 --> 57:37.355
Well, I find that hard to believe.
Why not?

57:39.159 --> 57:42.394
I was dating someone, but
touring and distance took a toll,

57:42.429 --> 57:46.097
and I don't think I wanted
to get close to anyone else.

57:46.133 --> 57:47.732
How come?

57:50.337 --> 57:52.503
After my mom passed away, I...

57:54.541 --> 57:57.809
I didn't want
to lose anyone else.

57:57.845 --> 57:59.978
What if you didn't
have to lose anyone?

58:06.386 --> 58:08.620
What about you?
Do you date?

58:08.655 --> 58:11.323
Not since
Christina's mother passed.

58:13.627 --> 58:16.962
I've devoted all my free time
to Christina.

58:16.997 --> 58:21.500
Plus, dating in the national
spotlight's a little bit daunting.

58:21.535 --> 58:25.537
Although I think
I'm ready to find someone.

58:25.572 --> 58:28.173
I know how much
Christina wants a family.

58:28.208 --> 58:30.775
And when I see her with you...

58:35.082 --> 58:37.382
I should get back to this.

58:37.417 --> 58:41.319
What is it,
some more state secrets?

58:41.355 --> 58:44.489
It's the Christmas Eve
dinner plan.

58:46.093 --> 58:48.994
So it's who's invited,
who sits where.

58:49.029 --> 58:50.695
The diplomats
with the diplomats,

58:50.731 --> 58:53.365
and the Cabinet is separated,
so they don't fight.

58:57.104 --> 58:59.337
Where would a commoner
like me sit?

59:01.041 --> 59:03.642
Well, there's nothing common
about you at all.

59:03.677 --> 59:08.346
So I mean, if you were to come
to the Christmas Eve dinner,

59:08.382 --> 59:10.949
I would seat you
right next to me.

59:23.463 --> 59:24.996
I have some news.

59:25.032 --> 59:26.976
I just got off the phone
with the real estate broker.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.767
The rink I was telling
you about in Trenton,

59:28.802 --> 59:30.802
- it just came on the market.
- That's great.

59:30.837 --> 59:33.116
Except that there's already some
potential buyers interested,

59:33.140 --> 59:35.840
so I was thinking maybe I should
go home and take a look at it.

59:35.876 --> 59:38.443
Okay, well, I...

59:38.478 --> 59:40.078
Besides you're gonna be home
in five days,

59:40.113 --> 59:42.914
and until then,
I will fill you in on everything.

59:42.950 --> 59:44.449
Okay.

59:48.122 --> 59:50.722
I'm so sorry
I have to leave so early.

59:53.494 --> 59:56.628
- Will you come back soon?
- I hope so.

59:58.632 --> 01:00:01.466
And I'll come visit you
in New Jersey.

01:00:01.502 --> 01:00:04.403
New. And then we'll go
visit Old Jersey together.

01:00:05.506 --> 01:00:07.239
- Bye, guys.
- Bye!

01:00:07.274 --> 01:00:08.807
- I love you.
- Call me when you land.

01:00:08.842 --> 01:00:10.742
I will, I promise.

01:00:17.785 --> 01:00:20.452
Are you sure you're able
to travel in this state?

01:00:20.487 --> 01:00:23.955
- I'll be okay.
- You don't need any assistance?

01:00:23.991 --> 01:00:25.891
Is that an option?

01:00:31.365 --> 01:00:34.399
- I'll come visit.
- I'd love that.

01:01:07.601 --> 01:01:10.168
You sound so beautiful,
Tina-bear.

01:01:11.705 --> 01:01:13.572
I'm just practicing
for caroling tomorrow.

01:01:13.607 --> 01:01:15.741
And everyone asked me
to go sledding after.

01:01:15.776 --> 01:01:18.477
- Can I go?
- Well, do you have time?

01:01:18.512 --> 01:01:21.747
Well, I already know my part.
I'm just waiting for Katie.

01:01:21.782 --> 01:01:24.149
And what's wrong?

01:01:24.184 --> 01:01:27.319
I'm waiting for her
to want to practice together.

01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:29.488
I don't think
she wants to skate.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.414
What are you doing?

01:01:55.449 --> 01:01:58.183
Going over the pageant
choreography in my head.

01:01:59.787 --> 01:02:02.721
Why in your head?
Why not just skate it?

01:02:04.124 --> 01:02:08.271
I tell myself that even though
in my dreams I'm on the ice,

01:02:08.306 --> 01:02:11.763
and every time I hear music,
I envision myself doing a routine,

01:02:11.799 --> 01:02:15.934
I still tell myself
I'm okay not skating.

01:02:15.969 --> 01:02:19.438
But agreeing to be in the pageant
and working with Christina,

01:02:19.473 --> 01:02:22.441
it's made me realize
that I miss skating...

01:02:22.476 --> 01:02:24.009
so much.

01:02:27.347 --> 01:02:29.781
I'm scared to get
back out there.

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:37.255
You know,
I'm terrified to be king.

01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:40.425
But I can't not do it
just because I'm afraid.

01:03:21.068 --> 01:03:24.035
I didn't think
you could make it.

01:03:24.071 --> 01:03:26.137
Do you remember
this is where first met?

01:03:26.173 --> 01:03:28.940
- When you were hiding.
- I wasn't hiding.

01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:19.724
San Senova is famous
for its night skies.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:22.127
Is that why you have
a star on your flag?

01:04:22.162 --> 01:04:26.531
Partially, but legend has it
that the star on the flag

01:04:26.566 --> 01:04:28.233
is actually the Christmas star.

01:04:28.268 --> 01:04:30.902
You're familiar with the story
of Princess Sonia...

01:04:30.937 --> 01:04:32.370
Very well by now.

01:04:32.405 --> 01:04:36.608
Well, the legend says
that as the night fell,

01:04:36.643 --> 01:04:39.778
Sonia and Catherine
followed the Christmas star

01:04:39.813 --> 01:04:42.447
and guided the villagers
back to safety.

01:04:42.482 --> 01:04:44.649
I didn't think
the Christmas star was real.

01:04:44.684 --> 01:04:47.085
You know, my father
use explain it as

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.488
like a personal guiding light,

01:04:50.524 --> 01:04:52.624
something inside of us.

01:04:52.659 --> 01:04:54.225
He used to say
that if I was ever lost

01:04:54.261 --> 01:04:57.295
and didn't know which way to go,

01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:59.931
I could come out
and find the San Senova star,

01:04:59.966 --> 01:05:02.801
the Christmas Star,
and it'd guide me home.

01:05:02.836 --> 01:05:04.803
That's what
you're doing out here.

01:05:04.838 --> 01:05:07.505
Looking for guidance.

01:05:07.541 --> 01:05:10.675
I guess I am.

01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:14.179
You know, I don't always know
how to be king,

01:05:14.214 --> 01:05:16.648
so I come out here,
and I find that star

01:05:16.683 --> 01:05:20.084
and try and remember who I am,

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.388
what I want, and what I love.

01:05:28.562 --> 01:05:31.496
What star do you
imagine it to be?

01:05:31.531 --> 01:05:35.667
That's easy. It's...
It's that one.

01:05:35.702 --> 01:05:38.169
- It's that one?
- No, no.

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:45.376
It's...

01:05:47.714 --> 01:05:50.048
that one there.

01:06:07.601 --> 01:06:09.167
Sorry.

01:06:10.971 --> 01:06:12.237
Of course.

01:06:13.607 --> 01:06:15.573
<i>- Hi.
- Katie, hi.</i>

01:06:15.609 --> 01:06:18.209
I'm at the rink, and it's...
it's perfect.

01:06:18.245 --> 01:06:22.046
But there are other buyers, and
one's already putting in an offer.

01:06:22.082 --> 01:06:23.326
<i>- What should I do?
- I don't know.</i>

01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:25.116
Do we have to make an offer now?

01:06:25.151 --> 01:06:27.418
The pageant's in three days.
I'll be home in four.

01:06:27.454 --> 01:06:29.320
<i>Okay.</i>

01:06:29.356 --> 01:06:31.723
Okay, yeah,
I'll try to buy us time.

01:06:31.758 --> 01:06:33.324
Okay, yeah, just keep me posted.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.960
<i>- I will. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

01:06:38.698 --> 01:06:40.331
It's getting cold.

01:06:40.367 --> 01:06:44.068
- We should probably go in.
- Yeah.

01:06:57.284 --> 01:06:59.551
Do you have a grievance
with that parcel, sir?

01:06:59.787 --> 01:07:02.521
Would you like to try?

01:07:10.565 --> 01:07:13.706
- What is it?
- It's a little something for Katie.

01:07:14.893 --> 01:07:17.412
She's leaving soon,
so it's the least I could do.

01:07:17.571 --> 01:07:20.305
After all,
she produced the pageant,

01:07:20.341 --> 01:07:22.541
helped with the staff
Christmas gifts.

01:07:22.576 --> 01:07:25.177
- Christina really loves her and...
- And you have feelings.

01:07:27.014 --> 01:07:28.714
What makes you think
I have feelings?

01:07:30.117 --> 01:07:32.885
The article in the paper, sir.

01:07:36.924 --> 01:07:39.291
Alex, relax.

01:07:39.326 --> 01:07:43.395
You're allowed to have feelings.
No one's gonna judge you for it.

01:07:43.431 --> 01:07:46.298
In fact, people will like you
all the more.

01:07:46.333 --> 01:07:48.901
- Katie's leaving.
- So?

01:07:48.936 --> 01:07:51.970
I've heard there's
this miraculous invention

01:07:52.006 --> 01:07:54.473
called "the aeroplane".

01:07:56.043 --> 01:07:58.644
You could go there,
she could come here.

01:08:00.347 --> 01:08:02.414
It's just not that simple.

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:04.950
She can't imagine how difficult
this whole situation is.

01:08:04.985 --> 01:08:07.820
<i>No, you're right.
She can't imagine it,</i>

01:08:07.855 --> 01:08:11.090
so you're going
to have to tell her.

01:08:13.661 --> 01:08:15.294
Okay, first run-through in five.

01:08:15.329 --> 01:08:17.462
Katie, Alex is asking to see you.

01:08:17.497 --> 01:08:20.265
Now? We're about to do
our first run-through.

01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:23.368
Well, I can take over
for you for a bit.

01:08:23.404 --> 01:08:27.673
I get to pretend I'm in charge.
Mustn't keep the king waiting.

01:08:27.707 --> 01:08:29.408
Thank you.

01:08:41.388 --> 01:08:43.287
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:08:43.323 --> 01:08:46.125
I didn't know
if you'd seen this.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.728
I didn't.

01:08:49.763 --> 01:08:51.130
What do you think?

01:08:51.165 --> 01:08:55.367
I think the photographer
got my good side?

01:08:55.402 --> 01:08:57.536
I like that about you.

01:08:57.571 --> 01:08:59.505
My photogenic angles?

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.473
Your ability to see
the good in everything.

01:09:03.844 --> 01:09:06.712
Because you don't see
the good in this.

01:09:06.747 --> 01:09:09.881
It's just not so simple as a flirtation
when the country's watching

01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:14.051
and Christina is growing attached,
and you're leaving.

01:09:15.622 --> 01:09:19.057
I understand it's not
so simple a flirtation.

01:09:19.093 --> 01:09:21.760
- That's not what I meant.
- It's okay because it's true.

01:09:21.795 --> 01:09:25.754
That's, that's all it is.
You're a king, and I'm...

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.067
...leaving.

01:09:32.238 --> 01:09:35.240
So what else is there to say?

01:09:40.814 --> 01:09:43.048
I should get back to rehearsal.

01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:54.726
- Hi.
- Hey, I'm at the ice rink.

01:09:54.762 --> 01:09:56.795
Someone's already
put in an offer,

01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:58.842
<i>and the real estate broker's
asking us what we want to do.</i>

01:09:58.866 --> 01:10:02.134
Well, what do you think
we should do?

01:10:02.169 --> 01:10:04.002
I want to put in an offer,

01:10:04.038 --> 01:10:06.305
but that seems crazy to me
when you haven't even seen it.

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.773
I mean, what if
you don't like it?

01:10:07.808 --> 01:10:09.641
I trust you.

01:10:09.677 --> 01:10:12.144
<i>Katie, this is a huge decision.</i>

01:10:12.179 --> 01:10:14.947
I can't make it for both of us.

01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:23.322
Well done, very good.

01:10:23.357 --> 01:10:26.258
It's almost time
for our rehearsal.

01:10:26.293 --> 01:10:28.827
Watch your hands.
A bit higher.

01:10:28.862 --> 01:10:31.697
I'm so sorry, Christina.

01:10:31.932 --> 01:10:33.899
But Jessica needs me.
I have to go home.

01:10:33.934 --> 01:10:35.834
What?

01:10:35.869 --> 01:10:38.036
I found a replacement
for the queen role.

01:10:38.071 --> 01:10:39.704
She's a great skater.

01:10:40.841 --> 01:10:42.140
You're leaving?

01:10:44.077 --> 01:10:45.544
I'm so sorry.

01:10:54.121 --> 01:10:55.954
This is for you.

01:11:14.575 --> 01:11:16.341
Ma'am.

01:11:19.646 --> 01:11:21.379
Is that Katie's costume?

01:11:21.415 --> 01:11:24.382
So she's finally going
to practice with Christina?

01:11:24.418 --> 01:11:27.786
I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.

01:11:27.821 --> 01:11:30.722
- I knew what?
- Katie went home.

01:11:50.011 --> 01:11:53.519
- What are you watching?
- A Christmas movie.

01:11:54.483 --> 01:11:57.817
Well, we both know
how that's going to end.

01:12:03.058 --> 01:12:04.991
Any chance you've
changed your mind

01:12:05.026 --> 01:12:07.427
about performing at the pageant?

01:12:07.462 --> 01:12:09.028
No.

01:12:09.064 --> 01:12:10.964
I don't want to play
Princess Sonia.

01:12:10.999 --> 01:12:15.001
Besides, Katie's replacement
doesn't know the part.

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.608
Well, Tina-bear,

01:12:21.643 --> 01:12:25.345
you do know your dear old dad
is quite the skater.

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:27.413
What if I replaced Katie?

01:12:30.218 --> 01:12:31.184
You?

01:12:31.219 --> 01:12:35.288
- The part's for a queen.
- But it can be for a king.

01:12:35.323 --> 01:12:37.023
It's our Christmas tradition.

01:12:37.058 --> 01:12:40.160
And we may not have a queen,

01:12:40.195 --> 01:12:44.564
but we have a princess,
and we have a king.

01:12:44.599 --> 01:12:46.332
There's nothing
more important for me

01:12:46.368 --> 01:12:48.468
than spending time at Christmas
with you.

01:12:57.045 --> 01:12:58.644
Aunt Patricia,

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.180
I was wondering if you could
help me with something.

01:13:01.216 --> 01:13:03.015
Well, of course.

01:13:03.051 --> 01:13:05.952
I've decided I want to cancel
the Christmas Eve dinner.

01:13:05.987 --> 01:13:08.187
Really?

01:13:08.223 --> 01:13:11.491
I think we can start
a new tradition.

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.681
A quiet family Christmas,
just us.

01:13:16.397 --> 01:13:19.031
Sounds lovely, Alex.

01:13:19.067 --> 01:13:21.100
Come on, let's go.

01:13:24.339 --> 01:13:26.472
You heard His Majesty.

01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:37.350
Hey!

01:13:37.385 --> 01:13:39.152
Look what I picked up
this morning.

01:13:39.187 --> 01:13:42.622
We're still in escrow,
but everything looks good,

01:13:42.657 --> 01:13:45.291
and the old owners said
to make this rink our own.

01:13:45.327 --> 01:13:47.193
- So...
- Okay.

01:13:48.396 --> 01:13:49.429
Where are you going?

01:13:54.235 --> 01:13:56.102
What?

01:14:02.277 --> 01:14:04.477
Kind of like a real Christmas.

01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:16.656
Thank you.

01:14:21.429 --> 01:14:25.631
You were so close.
Why did you stop?

01:14:32.707 --> 01:14:34.674
I guess I didn't want
to get hurt.

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:39.278
I didn't want to get close
and lose someone again.

01:14:39.314 --> 01:14:41.247
It doesn't make sense anyway.

01:14:41.282 --> 01:14:43.683
Alex and I come from
completely different worlds.

01:14:43.718 --> 01:14:45.752
We want different things.

01:14:47.956 --> 01:14:50.690
I was asking about skating.

01:14:53.428 --> 01:14:56.829
But you and Alex want
the same things...

01:14:56.864 --> 01:14:59.331
each other and family.

01:14:59.367 --> 01:15:01.901
And I think the home that you
were hoping you would find here,

01:15:01.936 --> 01:15:03.769
you found in San Senova.

01:15:03.805 --> 01:15:05.838
I know how scared you are

01:15:05.873 --> 01:15:07.273
of putting your heart
into something

01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:09.442
and really wanting it
and not getting it,

01:15:09.477 --> 01:15:11.055
but you didn't get
what you wanted with skating

01:15:11.079 --> 01:15:12.712
not because
you weren't good enough,

01:15:12.747 --> 01:15:15.081
but because you gave up on it.

01:15:15.116 --> 01:15:17.149
You shut down to it.

01:15:19.387 --> 01:15:23.956
You are my best friend, Katie.
You're like a sister to me.

01:15:23.991 --> 01:15:25.958
I don't want to watch you
waste any more time

01:15:25.993 --> 01:15:29.795
wishing that you'd gone after
the thing you really love.

01:15:29.831 --> 01:15:33.933
What was that thing your mom
always said about Christmas?

01:15:33.968 --> 01:15:36.435
It's a time
when we open our hearts.

01:15:36.471 --> 01:15:38.604
Or reopen them.

01:15:38.639 --> 01:15:41.207
Even when we're scared,
even when we've been hurt.

01:15:41.242 --> 01:15:42.374
Especially then.

01:15:45.446 --> 01:15:47.813
Go back to San Senova.

01:15:47.849 --> 01:15:51.217
- I can't.
- I can't leave you. You're family.

01:15:51.252 --> 01:15:53.819
Yeah, but wherever we go,
we'll always have each other.

01:15:53.855 --> 01:15:57.623
- But we just bought an ice rink.
- Yes, we did.

01:15:57.658 --> 01:15:59.959
But I was thinking,

01:15:59.994 --> 01:16:03.462
if you wanted to do
something else,

01:16:03.498 --> 01:16:06.432
then maybe you could be
a silent partner here.

01:16:08.469 --> 01:16:13.739
How are you going to start
and run a business alone?

01:16:13.775 --> 01:16:18.177
Well, actually,
I might have some help.

01:16:18.212 --> 01:16:20.546
And some help has arrived.

01:16:22.717 --> 01:16:24.817
- Hi!
- Hi.

01:16:27.889 --> 01:16:31.090
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:33.025
Our Jessica leaves
quite the lasting impression.

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.827
That she does.

01:16:34.862 --> 01:16:39.165
And we felt, as crazy as it is,
we had to give it a shot.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.533
Have an adventure.

01:16:40.568 --> 01:16:44.403
And I feel that running a training
center could be in my wheelhouse.

01:16:44.438 --> 01:16:48.240
After all, I've spent the last decade
overseeing the politics of a nation.

01:16:48.276 --> 01:16:52.411
I believe I'm well-versed
in performance and spectacle.

01:16:53.581 --> 01:16:54.847
From the king.

01:16:56.551 --> 01:16:57.850
Thank you.

01:17:00.721 --> 01:17:02.021
Bye.

01:17:23.978 --> 01:17:25.678
<i>Dear Katie,</i>

01:17:25.713 --> 01:17:28.581
<i>I remember you said
that people who care for you</i>

01:17:28.616 --> 01:17:30.950
<i>give you ornaments at Christmas,</i>

01:17:30.985 --> 01:17:34.587
<i>although I'm sure you will
argue this isn't an ornament.</i>

01:17:34.622 --> 01:17:36.789
<i>It's my Christmas star,</i>

01:17:36.824 --> 01:17:39.491
<i>and I hope it guides you home.</i>

01:17:39.527 --> 01:17:41.327
<i>Love, Alex".</i>

01:17:51.539 --> 01:17:54.306
Five, everybody!
Places in five!

01:17:56.677 --> 01:17:59.778
You look beautiful, Tina-bear.

01:18:01.315 --> 01:18:03.515
Alex, Alex!

01:18:03.551 --> 01:18:05.718
I thought before you went on,

01:18:05.753 --> 01:18:08.954
there's something
you ought to see.

01:18:10.691 --> 01:18:12.958
"San Senova's New Founder's Day.

01:18:12.994 --> 01:18:15.527
Tradition hosted by
the new Christmas King".

01:18:15.563 --> 01:18:17.529
The new Christmas King.

01:18:17.565 --> 01:18:21.333
Now, curtain's almost up,
so you'll give your speech,

01:18:21.369 --> 01:18:24.904
- and then... we'll begin.
- Come on.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.487
I'll see you out there
in a second.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.907
Merry Christmas Eve,

01:19:01.943 --> 01:19:05.744
<i>and welcome to San Senova's
Founder's Day Pageant,</i>

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.914
which I hope will be
the first of many to come.

01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:12.418
It was always my father's dream
to celebrate our founding

01:19:12.453 --> 01:19:13.986
with a Christmas spectacle.

01:19:14.021 --> 01:19:15.221
- Christina.
- Katie!

01:19:17.692 --> 01:19:20.760
You came back!

01:19:20.795 --> 01:19:23.496
I'm so sorry I left.
Can you forgive me?

01:19:23.531 --> 01:19:27.366
The retelling
of how San Senova came to be.

01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:31.303
Daddy!

01:19:41.716 --> 01:19:44.550
This has been
a very special Christmas,

01:19:44.585 --> 01:19:47.386
perhaps the most special

01:19:47.421 --> 01:19:53.225
because I was shown
the true meaning of the holiday,

01:19:53.261 --> 01:19:57.296
that Christmas is a time
that no matter where we are

01:19:57.331 --> 01:20:00.633
or how we are, we're
brought back to one another,

01:20:00.668 --> 01:20:05.304
that Christmas is a day that
reminds us of our greatest gifts:

01:20:05.339 --> 01:20:07.373
our family,

01:20:07.408 --> 01:20:09.708
<i>our friends,</i>

01:20:09.744 --> 01:20:12.812
<i>our community,</i>

01:20:12.847 --> 01:20:14.780
and our country.

01:20:23.491 --> 01:20:25.024
The people we love.

01:20:28.296 --> 01:20:31.397
That Christmas is a day
that guides us home.

01:20:31.432 --> 01:20:34.099
So from my family to yours,

01:20:34.135 --> 01:20:37.803
I wish you all
a very merry Christmas.

01:20:47.949 --> 01:20:49.281
Cheers.

01:21:02.029 --> 01:21:04.096
The ice is yours.

01:21:22.416 --> 01:21:24.450
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:21:37.498 --> 01:21:40.165
I'm very glad
I didn't have to do that.

01:21:56.250 --> 01:22:00.252
- I'm so happy you came back.
- Me too.

01:22:00.287 --> 01:22:03.555
I realized that
I don't want to train anymore.

01:22:03.591 --> 01:22:05.090
I want to skate.

01:22:05.126 --> 01:22:08.093
And I was thinking
San Senova has the tourists,

01:22:08.129 --> 01:22:09.828
you've got a rink,

01:22:09.864 --> 01:22:11.775
we've got the perfect makings
for a permanent show.

01:22:11.799 --> 01:22:13.966
With a role for me, I hope.

01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:16.568
You'd have to audition.

01:22:17.771 --> 01:22:22.608
Katie, it doesn't matter to me if I'm
a king, and you're the prom queen.

01:22:22.643 --> 01:22:28.350
I'm just a man who loves a woman
who he hopes loves him back.
