09:46.620 --> 09:49.854
Oh, it's just a quick
day trip to Japan, mom.

09:49.856 --> 09:53.625
See, your mom said
you were a good big brother,

09:53.627 --> 09:56.628
yeah, until han
busts out of the baby bag

09:56.630 --> 09:58.430
an decides
to do laps on the wing.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.098
Ok, come on, han,
here, come here.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.833
All right, let's try
the book again, ok?

10:01.835 --> 10:04.869

the good part.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.622
I am so sorry
for the confusion.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.868
Ah, baby always gets the love.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.203
My apologies,
Stoppable-San,

11:12.205 --> 11:14.372
but han is like
a little sister to me.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.941
I mean, since we got her
from the pet store.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.911
Sensei, he has been expecting
you, Stoppable-San.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.746
That's probably because
he forgot to give me

11:21.748 --> 11:25.717
the instruction book to my wild,
little, super ninja sister.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.819
Yeah, we just have
a few questions,

11:27.821 --> 11:29.387
and we'll be out of your hair.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.955
Oh, I see,

11:30.957 --> 11:34.259
by suggesting you would leave
us in our time of need,

11:34.261 --> 11:37.429

your American-style jokes.

time of need thing.

remain as guardians.

sent away for safety.

11:51.678 --> 11:56.381
But, like, accidentally losing
my pants in public kinda bad?

11:56.383 --> 11:57.916
Or, like, eating
a plate of nacos

11:57.918 --> 12:00.452
and finding a hair
in the cheese kinda bad?

12:00.454 --> 12:02.353
Sensei:
Though this hair conundrum

12:02.355 --> 12:04.456
you speak of sounds bad,

12:04.458 --> 12:07.592
I do fear something much worse.

12:07.594 --> 12:10.428
Monkey Fist will unearth yono.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.330

In fact, I want to see it all
when you crush my enemies.

Ok, wait a minute, let me see
if I've got this straight.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.420
You secretly placed
han in my family

for a showdown
