you can't learn in school-

08:04.217 --> 08:06.276
- "zazz."
- What is "zazz"?

08:06.385 --> 08:09.252
"Zing," "zork," "kapowza"-
Call it what you want.

08:09.355 --> 08:11.846
In any language
it spells mazuma in the bank.

- "Zork"? What is "zork"?
- I didn't say "zork"?

08:14.694 --> 08:16.594
The point is the camera loves him.

from yesterday's school lunch.

11:30.489 --> 11:33.515
No, I haven't, Lisa.
Because I went out with a camera...

11:33.626 --> 11:35.594
and did a different kind of story.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.595
[Nervous Chuckles]
Bart, do you really think-

11:37.697 --> 11:40.359
It's about a man.
A simple man.

11:40.466 --> 11:43.697
He's one of... Bart's People.

11:45.237 --> 11:47.762

<i>But last month</i>
<i>Joe made a discovery-</i>

11:55.614 --> 11:58.481
<i>the ducks were gone.</i>

11:58.584 --> 12:01.075
Some say the ducks went to Canada.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.155
Others say Toronto.

12:03.255 --> 12:07.555
And some people think that
Joe used to sit down there, near those ducks.

12:07.660 --> 12:12.120
But it could be that there's just no room
in this modern world...

Well, I'm sorry you couldn't feel
for old Joe.

13:02.915 --> 13:06.851
- You didn't feel for him either, you big fat phony.
- <i>Bart, look up here.</i>

They call her the "Cat Lady."

13:25.504 --> 13:29.998

she has a few dozen cats.
