WEBVTT

00:01.420 --> 00:03.379
Your daughter is a goddess.

00:03.380 --> 00:04.819
Please don't make
me go with him.

00:04.820 --> 00:07.259
I'm no good at this.
You have to have a keeper!

00:07.260 --> 00:08.499
We need another girl.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.579
It is murder,

00:09.580 --> 00:11.419
and it is not worth my while.

00:11.420 --> 00:13.979
The price of my young
slaves has gone up.

00:13.980 --> 00:15.339
I want a hundred
pounds for them.

00:15.340 --> 00:17.179
I thought I might try
my chances in America.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.659
Care to join me?

00:18.660 --> 00:20.019
You bitch!

00:20.020 --> 00:21.659
Let me go.

00:21.660 --> 00:23.179
She'll kill me!

00:23.180 --> 00:24.819
Charles, speak to me, please!

00:24.820 --> 00:26.779
I'm leaving.
I say when you leave!

00:26.780 --> 00:29.659
Tell them how you got me
to behave tonight.

00:29.660 --> 00:31.019
You'll know your place.

00:31.020 --> 00:32.098
Will you pin me to the bed,

00:32.100 --> 00:33.299
tell me that you're
my lord and master

00:33.300 --> 00:34.780
and rape me?

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

01:40.660 --> 01:41.580
Hello, you know what we want!

01:41.581 --> 01:43.339
We want some cunny!

01:43.340 --> 01:45.299
We want cunny, we want cunny!

01:45.300 --> 01:46.300
All right, calm down.
I want her.

01:46.301 --> 01:48.340
I want her!

02:59.700 --> 03:03.859
Emily Lacey is
laughing at your fate.

03:03.860 --> 03:06.539
Mumma, she can't have
known what would happen.

03:06.540 --> 03:09.299
She would have
killed you stone dead

03:09.300 --> 03:13.019
if it had suited her purpose.

03:13.020 --> 03:15.300
Let's forget she was ever here.

03:18.460 --> 03:20.900
You do that, my treasure.

03:30.740 --> 03:32.739
What if she
finds out where I am?

03:32.740 --> 03:34.539
No one here's going to tell her.

03:34.540 --> 03:37.579
I left her son
swimming in laudanum.

03:37.580 --> 03:39.179
She's going to
scalp me and skin me

03:39.180 --> 03:40.859
and make me into
a wig and gloves.

03:40.860 --> 03:42.819
I was afraid
of that harridan once.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.179
But Dame Quigley's like
the shadow of a monster.

03:45.180 --> 03:46.859
You turn around and
face her, you might find

03:46.860 --> 03:49.140
the shadow's nothing but a flea.

03:51.460 --> 03:54.419
She cannot be seen.

03:54.420 --> 03:56.260
Let no one in.

04:04.020 --> 04:05.980
It gets easier.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.019
Forgive me.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.860
I thought you sad.

04:13.300 --> 04:16.259
I've never had this.

04:16.260 --> 04:18.259
It's my own money.

04:18.260 --> 04:19.858
It is a solace.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.379
It's hope

04:21.380 --> 04:23.820
that I can buy back my children.

04:25.380 --> 04:29.819
When were you freed, Mr. North?

04:29.820 --> 04:32.699
I was born a free Englishman.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.299
Foundling.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.499
I'm sorry for assuming...

04:36.500 --> 04:40.139
This is the trinket
my mother left,

04:40.140 --> 04:43.739
to know me by when she returned.

04:43.740 --> 04:45.940
Only she never did.

04:48.420 --> 04:52.019
We must do what
we can for Harriet.

04:52.020 --> 04:53.499
I feel for her plight,

04:53.500 --> 04:55.179
but I must settle my own
debt with Mr. Lennox

04:55.180 --> 04:57.739
before I can do anything.

04:57.740 --> 05:01.060
It galls me that I've got
to pay him back so soon.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.499
What news, Mr. Lennox?

05:06.500 --> 05:09.499
Your country's 122
million pounds in debt.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.619
I find that
strangely comforting.

05:11.620 --> 05:14.059
Your boy may sit over there.

05:14.060 --> 05:16.059
Come now, Mr. Lennox,

05:16.060 --> 05:17.299
I sit where I please.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.499
Mr. North is his own man.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.620
I'd have him sit there.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.059
Now.

05:25.060 --> 05:28.619
Here's 50 pounds of my own
national debt repaid.

05:28.620 --> 05:32.179
I suggest a weekly
repayment of 25 pounds,

05:32.180 --> 05:34.259
at a rate of
interest to be agreed.

05:34.260 --> 05:37.139
There's little to keep me
here since my father died.

05:37.140 --> 05:40.579
If I have no amusements,
I'll go home to Virginia.

05:40.580 --> 05:43.739
The interest is continued
repayment in kind.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.739
Our girls won't have you.

05:45.740 --> 05:47.379
I'm sure we can come
to some arrangement.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.939
It galls them

05:48.940 --> 05:50.299
that you keep your
brother and sister

05:50.300 --> 05:52.699
as your slaves.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.619
Do you presume to lecture me?

05:55.620 --> 05:57.299
Come now.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.259
Let's take our coffee
in a civilized manner.

05:59.260 --> 06:02.059
How is it civilized to
sit here with a primitive?

06:02.060 --> 06:03.259
If you were on my estate,

06:03.260 --> 06:04.939
I'd whip the flesh
from your back

06:04.940 --> 06:06.739
for showing insolence to me.

06:06.740 --> 06:09.739
If you weren't such a milksop,
I'd do the same to you,

06:09.740 --> 06:11.179
right here. Will!

06:11.180 --> 06:12.819
I do not accept your terms.

06:12.820 --> 06:14.859
I want my money
in full this afternoon.

06:14.860 --> 06:17.300
Mr. Lennox!

06:20.620 --> 06:21.620
You're angry.

06:21.621 --> 06:24.619
No... I'm proud of you.

06:24.620 --> 06:26.620
But you're angry.

06:31.860 --> 06:34.260
I can't get these laced at all.

06:36.180 --> 06:37.499
What is it?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.940
She has a baby in there.

06:41.820 --> 06:43.180
Fanny!

06:45.500 --> 06:47.259
You must go to Mrs. Wells.

06:47.260 --> 06:50.379
She won't have a baby in
the house, you know that.

06:50.380 --> 06:52.019
She'll kick me out.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.699
Quigley the same.

06:53.700 --> 06:57.179
Any girl begins
to show and... gone.

06:57.180 --> 07:00.499
The way she turned Emily away,

07:00.500 --> 07:02.619
it was cruel.

07:02.620 --> 07:05.180
And she'll do the same to me.

07:09.260 --> 07:10.739
What?

07:10.740 --> 07:11.939
Nothing.

07:11.940 --> 07:13.500
Are you gossiping
spite about my mother?

07:15.700 --> 07:18.419
You'd be fucking in the
gutter if it wasn't for her.

07:18.420 --> 07:19.939
You want to wash your mouth out.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.139
And you want to
wash out your crack.

07:22.140 --> 07:24.259
Don't you dare
speak to me like that.

07:24.260 --> 07:26.379
Take your breakfast
and go to your room.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.019
This is my house.

07:28.020 --> 07:30.259
Well, your mother's
left me in charge

07:30.260 --> 07:32.180
and I say go to your room.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.379
Leave your cares
on the threshold

07:50.380 --> 07:54.140
and enter our house of revels.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.299
Harriet and MarieLouise
are with culls,

08:02.300 --> 08:04.259
two more await.

08:04.260 --> 08:07.059
I can take one, but why
can't Lucy take the other?

08:07.060 --> 08:09.139
She gave me a mouthful
of vexatious language

08:09.140 --> 08:11.139
and I sent her to her room.

08:11.140 --> 08:12.299
Where's Fanny?

08:12.300 --> 08:13.619
She's out.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.260
Buying condoms.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.820
Stop vexing Kitty,
you bad shrimp.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.499
I need your answer
for Lord Fallon.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.740
Will you make me have him?

08:33.620 --> 08:35.139
No.

08:35.140 --> 08:38.099
Of course I won't.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.979
Won't never get such
an offer again, though.

08:40.980 --> 08:43.460
What will happen if I say no?

08:47.860 --> 08:51.739
No good will ever come out of
being Mrs. Quigley's creature.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.899
I'm glad to hear you say it.

08:53.900 --> 08:57.019
We'll leave as soon
as you're able.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.259
We cannot.

08:58.260 --> 09:01.259
God will provide.

09:01.260 --> 09:05.379
She holds me in pincers.

09:05.380 --> 09:10.019
She has me writhing on
the lies that I have told.

09:10.020 --> 09:13.499
And in my fever,
one thing became clear:

09:13.500 --> 09:15.619
Only the truth will free me.

09:15.620 --> 09:16.859
What lies?

09:16.860 --> 09:20.020
I have drawn a veil
across my past.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.659
I am a sinner, child.

09:23.660 --> 09:27.019
We are all sinners. No, no!

09:27.020 --> 09:31.539
I was once an obscene
and shameful...

09:31.540 --> 09:35.099
I was once a...

09:35.100 --> 09:37.099
The things I did! Mother.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.499
God scourged me.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.019
This mist He sent
across my eyes.

09:42.020 --> 09:45.740
No amount of crying
will ever wash me clean.

09:48.740 --> 09:51.260
You were once a harlot?

09:57.500 --> 09:59.619
Your father could be
one of twenty men.

09:59.620 --> 10:00.899
I've lied.

10:00.900 --> 10:05.659
I've lied, I've lied,
I've lied, I've lied!

10:05.660 --> 10:08.260
It doesn't matter.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.860
God sent me a daughter.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.860
You've saved me.

10:26.260 --> 10:29.379
Emily Lacey's
sheltering at mine.

10:29.380 --> 10:30.619
I won't help her.

10:30.620 --> 10:32.019
You have money now.

10:32.020 --> 10:33.499
You can pay off
her debt to Quigley.

10:33.500 --> 10:37.019
No, no, no. You have to, Mags.

10:37.020 --> 10:39.259
He warned me not
to kick that nest.

10:39.260 --> 10:40.979
Advice I should have taken.

10:40.980 --> 10:43.219
We both know what it's like
to be immured at Quigley's.

10:43.220 --> 10:46.219
We fought her off,
two green girls.

10:46.220 --> 10:48.259
She should do the same.
She's alone.

10:48.260 --> 10:49.860
We had each other.

10:52.020 --> 10:54.619
I need your help.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.659
Nance.

10:56.660 --> 10:59.339
That girl's not
worthy of your care.

10:59.340 --> 11:02.339
Quigley'll kill her.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.499
When we escaped,
we talked into the night

11:04.500 --> 11:07.379
about the kind of bawd
it might be possible to be,

11:07.380 --> 11:09.339
and you said...
I've tried to be that bawd,

11:09.340 --> 11:10.499
you know I have.
... you said we should sustain

11:10.500 --> 11:11.260
and defend each other.

11:11.261 --> 11:12.979
We do.

11:12.980 --> 11:16.340
You have the standing now
to properly oppose that woman.

11:20.260 --> 11:23.019
You have five minutes
of my time, madam.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.980
What do you want?

11:28.740 --> 11:32.339
I can see how it's gone.

11:32.340 --> 11:36.539
One zealous Spartan
squeezes too hard,

11:36.540 --> 11:39.379
feels a thrilling power,

11:39.380 --> 11:44.339
and a girl dies.

11:44.340 --> 11:46.499
He wants the others
to share his crime,

11:46.500 --> 11:49.659
and truth be told,
there are one or two

11:49.660 --> 11:51.459
with a thirst to try.

11:51.460 --> 11:55.739
So another girl must be
found, and then another,

11:55.740 --> 12:01.020
until they are
united in their deed.

12:04.900 --> 12:08.499
They have me trapped.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.739
I cannot free myself.

12:10.740 --> 12:14.460
I have the most
perfect girl for them.

12:16.500 --> 12:20.219
The Spartans are in
for some very fine sport.

12:20.220 --> 12:23.499
Do I understand you correctly?

12:23.500 --> 12:26.339
They won't be able
to restrain themselves.

12:26.340 --> 12:29.259
And they won't need to;
This girl deserves her fate.

12:29.260 --> 12:30.859
Lydia, let us be very clear.

12:30.860 --> 12:34.339
'Tis their murder, not ours.

12:34.340 --> 12:37.499
These men have formidable power.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.499
Yes, and we're offering
them godlike power,

12:39.500 --> 12:43.379
the power of life and death.

12:43.380 --> 12:44.900
Discreetly provided.

12:47.020 --> 12:51.020
Our price must be
knowing who they are.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.619
I can't have it,
I'll be thrown out.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.140
Well, why didn't
you come to me sooner?

13:23.020 --> 13:25.220
This baby's almost
ready to be born.

13:26.780 --> 13:28.620
It can't be, that's not right.

13:34.660 --> 13:36.740
Here's its head.

13:41.740 --> 13:43.980
And there's its back.

13:55.100 --> 13:58.099
Who can help you, Fanny?

13:58.100 --> 14:01.859
You got a mother or a sister?

14:01.860 --> 14:03.379
I can't have it!

14:03.380 --> 14:06.379
There's no more
denying it, my love.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.740
Your baby's coming.

14:18.620 --> 14:21.019
What's the matter?

14:21.020 --> 14:23.139
Have you lost your dazzle?

14:23.140 --> 14:25.379
I'm out on my heels, Nancy.

14:25.380 --> 14:27.779
I can't get another keeper.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.779
Well, go home to your ma.

14:29.780 --> 14:31.459
She'll help you.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.459
I'll get nothing but
tribulation from her.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.859
She'd do anything for you.

14:35.860 --> 14:37.859
Damn peculiar way of showing it.

14:37.860 --> 14:39.379
Well, are you looking
for a start at my place?

14:39.380 --> 14:41.099
Maybe.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.140
Just go to your ma.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.539
I wanted you to know,
my lord, what she was like.

14:52.540 --> 14:55.219
Out of my sight.

14:55.220 --> 14:57.659
I contended daily with
her lustful onslaughts.

14:57.660 --> 14:58.739
Brutus!

14:58.740 --> 14:59.740
Traitor!

14:59.741 --> 15:01.619
She goaded me with
wanton proposals

15:01.620 --> 15:03.619
whenever your back was turned.

15:03.620 --> 15:06.739
She was like a
succubus upon my soul.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.619
My loyalty is to
you and your house.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.860
It was not readily I fell.

15:20.020 --> 15:24.219
You need to eat, or
the gin'll corrode you.

15:24.220 --> 15:25.619
I want nothing from you.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.459
You suck wormwood
from Quigley's dugs.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.779
You should learn
who your friends are.

15:30.780 --> 15:32.620
Then you might survive.

15:40.460 --> 15:42.659
Sir George.

15:42.660 --> 15:43.779
We're honored.

15:43.780 --> 15:45.540
Get me the Wells mother.

15:48.020 --> 15:51.740
My ties and obligations
to Charlotte Wells are cut.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.019
She's a wild and reckless girl.

15:58.020 --> 16:00.139
I've often told her so.

16:00.140 --> 16:01.780
I want Lucy.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.859
Well.

16:07.860 --> 16:09.859
I'm sure she could comfort you.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.259
Allow me to prepare a room.

16:11.260 --> 16:13.619
I want her for my mistress.

16:13.620 --> 16:16.619
The town will see how little
I care for Charlotte Wells.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.019
You'd be Lucy's keeper.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.779
Yes.

16:19.780 --> 16:22.499
Now.

16:22.500 --> 16:25.219
This is most unexpected.
Bring her.

16:25.220 --> 16:26.859
When we've agreed on my terms.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.019
I've had a fat
and fruitful offer

16:28.020 --> 16:29.619
from Lord Fallon for my Lucy.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.139
What's your price?

16:31.140 --> 16:32.899
A hundred pounds on her head,

16:32.900 --> 16:34.619
another at the week's end,

16:34.620 --> 16:36.659
a stipend of 400 yearly.

16:36.660 --> 16:39.859
And should you ever tire of her,

16:39.860 --> 16:42.020
a pension for the same.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.739
Lucy is exceptional.

16:45.740 --> 16:48.099
She'll adorn your arm by day

16:48.100 --> 16:50.139
and treasure you at night.

16:50.140 --> 16:53.259
I was the first man
ever to touch her.

16:53.260 --> 16:56.619
Do you agree to my terms?

16:56.620 --> 16:58.020
I do.

17:04.780 --> 17:06.059
Then she's yours.

17:06.060 --> 17:07.499
I'll go and tell her
the happy news.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.419
I want to. No, I must.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.299
She will need time
to compose herself.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.900
Are you deaf?

17:17.740 --> 17:20.099
Look who I've
brought to see you.

17:24.020 --> 17:25.940
I have joyful tidings.

17:34.980 --> 17:36.740
You belong to me.

17:40.220 --> 17:44.499
Sir George wants
Lucy as his mistress.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.219
What of Charlotte?

17:46.220 --> 17:49.059
She's arming against him.

17:49.060 --> 17:51.220
Lucy's made.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.259
I like your simplicity,

17:57.260 --> 18:00.179
your willingness to
gratify and honor me.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.899
You're a girl I could form
in the flame of my own will.

18:02.900 --> 18:07.499
ls Charlotte
Don't mention her name again.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.419
Am I to leave here

18:09.420 --> 18:10.739
and live in your house?

18:10.740 --> 18:12.660
Yes, of course you are.

18:18.780 --> 18:22.739
You're moved, I can see it.

18:22.740 --> 18:25.419
I've changed your fate
in a single stroke.

18:25.420 --> 18:29.739
Like an idol, like a god.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.899
Abandon yourself to me.

18:31.900 --> 18:34.499
No. Yes, you must.

18:34.500 --> 18:37.020
I'm now your master
and your lord.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.579
Don't affect coyness.

18:45.580 --> 18:47.979
I want my mother.

18:47.980 --> 18:51.420
Your modesty's out of place.

18:53.020 --> 18:54.739
Do not refuse me.

18:54.740 --> 18:57.219
You may not ever refuse me.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.260
No!

19:21.700 --> 19:24.179
Mrs. Wells!

19:24.180 --> 19:26.900
Mrs. Wells!

19:31.820 --> 19:33.499
What did you do to her?

19:33.500 --> 19:34.979
I didn't touch her!

19:34.980 --> 19:37.180
What'd you do?
Nothing I didn't pay you for!

19:41.260 --> 19:42.739
The harlot stuck me, she's mad!

19:42.740 --> 19:45.059
You must have hurt her.
I didn't touch her!

19:45.060 --> 19:46.739
God!

19:46.740 --> 19:48.179
Get her out.

19:48.180 --> 19:49.339
Go with Pa.

19:49.340 --> 19:50.739
Why did you not
tell me she's mad?

19:50.740 --> 19:52.219
Let me see to your wound, sir.

19:52.220 --> 19:54.339
All will be well.
Get me out to my coachman.

19:54.340 --> 19:57.659
If you exert yourself, the
bleeding will worsen tenfold.

19:57.660 --> 19:59.899
Be still, be calm.

19:59.900 --> 20:03.300
Kitty, go to Wardour Street
and fetch Dr. Rodney.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.219
I'm going to go and
get you some water

20:07.220 --> 20:09.179
and something for the pain.

20:09.180 --> 20:11.500
Please don't move.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.340
Kitty!

20:19.940 --> 20:21.979
You can't get a surgeon.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.459
You can't get anyone.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.539
No one must know.

20:25.540 --> 20:27.340
He'll bleed to death.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.499
You might save him, Kitty,

20:31.500 --> 20:33.819
if you go.

20:33.820 --> 20:37.219
But Lucy, she'll be lost.

20:37.220 --> 20:39.300
They will hang her.

20:43.540 --> 20:46.699
I'll clear the house of culls.
No.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.899
Everything must go on as normal.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.939
Go and tell the coachman
Sir George has decided

20:52.940 --> 20:54.899
to stay for the day.

20:54.900 --> 20:57.700
Make sure he leaves.

21:12.260 --> 21:13.739
The surgeon is sent for.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.579
Kitty is running like the wind.

21:16.580 --> 21:20.019
Please, you must rest.

21:20.020 --> 21:21.940
I want my man Haxby.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.259
You'll be right as
a gun in no time.

21:28.260 --> 21:29.499
Just rest.

21:29.500 --> 21:32.259
Send the coach I want Haxby.

21:32.260 --> 21:34.340
I'll ask Mr. North
to go directly.

21:41.820 --> 21:44.499
Lucy, I must go.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.579
Your ma needs me.

21:46.580 --> 21:49.539
Mr. North, II need
to speak to you.

21:49.540 --> 21:50.739
Not now.

21:50.740 --> 21:51.580
What's wrong with her?

21:51.581 --> 21:53.459
She cannot tell you.

21:53.460 --> 21:54.740
Sit with her.

22:01.740 --> 22:06.100
Are you feeling guilty
for being a nasty slit?

22:17.260 --> 22:19.260
This'll help with the pain.

22:24.020 --> 22:26.059
How is he?

22:26.060 --> 22:28.019
Strong as an ox.

22:28.020 --> 22:29.900
All will be well.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.659
What keeps the surgeon?

22:37.660 --> 22:39.820
Let's find out, shall we?

22:44.220 --> 22:46.499
I never sent for one.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.339
You'll let him die?

22:48.340 --> 22:50.259
I must save Lucy.

22:50.260 --> 22:53.219
She'll be charged with
murder, not just wounding.

22:53.220 --> 22:55.299
They'll hang her for
wounding him anyway.

22:55.300 --> 22:57.499
He attacked her.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.820
Pleasure is this way, sir.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.899
It's his word versus ours.

23:08.900 --> 23:11.259
She's still a child.

23:11.260 --> 23:14.099
Justice will have mercy.

23:14.100 --> 23:17.099
She's a harlot, and they
will hang her anyway.

23:17.100 --> 23:22.019
If we don't save him,
Lucy will be damned.

23:22.020 --> 23:25.660
Her soul will burn for murder.

23:28.100 --> 23:31.019
You must go.

23:31.020 --> 23:32.940
Go!

23:38.500 --> 23:40.820
I've come for my girl,
where's my girl?

23:43.500 --> 23:45.259
We paid our debt for the
girl and now she's ours.

23:45.260 --> 23:48.020
Not the French piece,
Emily Lacey!

23:49.980 --> 23:52.179
She came to us
in a dreadful state.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.659
Said you'd beaten her obscenely.

23:53.660 --> 23:58.019
So Margaret Wells has been
foolish enough to take her in.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.259
We gave her some comfort
and sent her on her way.

24:01.260 --> 24:05.739
I told her I wanted
no conflict with you.

24:05.740 --> 24:09.780
So leave my house,
or conflict there will be.

24:12.420 --> 24:15.019
Look at your neck.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.499
You'd always blotch
red when you lied.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.259
I speak truth.

24:19.260 --> 24:23.259
Your skin is florid with deceit.

24:23.260 --> 24:24.739
She is here.

24:24.740 --> 24:26.299
Get out.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.259
Emily Lacey, I'm coming for you!

24:28.260 --> 24:30.459
Get out of my house!

24:30.460 --> 24:33.299
Even if I knew where
she wasand I don't

24:33.300 --> 24:35.539
I'd rather cut out my tongue
than give her over to you.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.740
She tried to kill Charles!

24:43.340 --> 24:46.059
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:46.060 --> 24:47.739
But I tell you,

24:47.740 --> 24:50.699
Emily Lacey is
not in this house.

24:50.700 --> 24:53.100
Consider yourself under siege.

24:59.900 --> 25:01.499
Apologies, sir,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.339
if your pleasure's
been disturbed.

25:03.340 --> 25:05.100
This way.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.939
I'm sorry.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.260
You should be
manacled and branded.

25:28.780 --> 25:31.220
Lucy, Lucy!

25:33.300 --> 25:34.459
Mrs. Wells.

25:34.460 --> 25:35.499
Constable.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.020
I've come for my Fanny.

25:45.660 --> 25:47.499
Where's my surgeon?

25:47.500 --> 25:49.259
He's very close.

25:49.260 --> 25:51.580
Now, you must take
something for the pain.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.780
Not too much, now.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.020
Mother.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.059
It's Mrs. Quigley.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.739
I can tell

26:25.740 --> 26:28.340
by the smell of rotting lilies.

26:30.660 --> 26:32.539
What happened?

26:32.540 --> 26:33.540
Who did this?

26:33.541 --> 26:34.699
You did.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.259
You poisoned the
girl against me.

26:36.260 --> 26:39.739
He wanted Lucy as his mistress.

26:39.740 --> 26:41.979
You sold him Lucy?

26:41.980 --> 26:43.659
How much did you get?

26:43.660 --> 26:45.899
What does it matter?

26:45.900 --> 26:48.539
lt is done. How much money?

26:48.540 --> 26:49.699
I did it for Lucy.

26:49.700 --> 26:51.419
This is your doing.

26:51.420 --> 26:53.419
Curse you.

26:53.420 --> 26:56.899
Howard!
I hope you die in anguish.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.780
You are vile.

27:04.060 --> 27:06.259
Charlotte!

27:06.260 --> 27:07.900
I need you.

27:15.420 --> 27:17.739
Do you not think
I'm scourging myself?

27:17.740 --> 27:19.259
He blames me.

27:19.260 --> 27:21.499
It's my fault.

27:21.500 --> 27:25.459
You nor Lucy
will take the blame.

27:25.460 --> 27:29.259
I need you to get Nancy for me.

27:29.260 --> 27:30.980
Please help me.

27:50.820 --> 27:53.899
There is no surgeon.

27:53.900 --> 27:56.220
You'll sit and watch me die.

27:58.060 --> 27:59.940
No.

28:02.740 --> 28:04.700
No!

28:15.820 --> 28:18.100
No, my lord.

28:22.020 --> 28:25.180
Shh, shh.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.500
It's my murder now.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.700
It'll be me who'll burn.

29:48.660 --> 29:50.499
We need to burn the linen,

29:50.500 --> 29:52.499
clean the blood from the room.

29:52.500 --> 29:55.259
Do as you want.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.019
I'm asking for your help.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.539
Now?

29:58.540 --> 30:00.099
When it's too late?

30:00.100 --> 30:02.699
I weighed everything you said.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.819
Go your own way, Margaret.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.100
You always will.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.739
I did it for Lucy!

30:11.740 --> 30:14.099
We'll hang,

30:14.100 --> 30:17.299
both of us along with her.

30:17.300 --> 30:19.260
We'll hang for this.

30:23.180 --> 30:24.499
It's Ma.

30:24.500 --> 30:25.980
Go!

30:47.740 --> 30:51.699
I've come for my money.

30:51.700 --> 30:53.660
Wait there.

31:02.460 --> 31:05.179
I'm going home to Virginia.

31:05.180 --> 31:06.499
What of my children?

31:06.500 --> 31:08.739
You may purchase them
until tomorrow.

31:08.740 --> 31:10.019
How?

31:10.020 --> 31:12.899
I sail on the evening tide.
Benjamin, please.

31:12.900 --> 31:15.299
I implore you in the name
of God, give them to me.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.099
They are your own
blood, I beg you!

31:17.100 --> 31:19.100
What an exhibition you are.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.819
Mr. North.

31:22.820 --> 31:24.499
Pay for my children.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.660
Don't let him make them slaves.

31:29.820 --> 31:32.979
For her children.

31:32.980 --> 31:34.540
Please.

31:37.060 --> 31:40.499
When my mother was
still dying in her bed,

31:40.500 --> 31:44.059
you whored yourself
to my father.

31:44.060 --> 31:46.259
He sent me away because of you.

31:46.260 --> 31:48.820
Take the money, Mr. Lennox.

31:51.100 --> 31:55.299
Your mongrels are mine by law.

31:55.300 --> 31:58.179
You are a monster, a monster!

31:58.180 --> 32:00.299
Do nothing you will regret.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.099
He longs to destroy you.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.179
Go after him, don't
let him take them!

32:04.180 --> 32:05.499
I'll do all I can.

32:05.500 --> 32:08.819
Help me, please!
I will, I promise.

32:08.820 --> 32:10.099
But now, be calm.

32:10.100 --> 32:12.059
The business of
the house must go on.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.939
I cannot see culls,
how could you think it?

32:13.940 --> 32:15.939
Harriet!

32:15.940 --> 32:20.299
I give you my word, he will
not take your children.

32:20.300 --> 32:22.940
But now, I need you to help me.

32:25.100 --> 32:26.900
Please.

32:35.820 --> 32:39.699
I can sense your despair.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.259
I can smell it.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.899
You're an awfully tedious whore.

32:43.900 --> 32:48.579
I have been blessed by God.

32:48.580 --> 32:51.459
I am soaring with joy.

32:51.460 --> 32:54.259
I'm free.

32:54.260 --> 32:59.099
There are no secrets
between my daughter and I.

32:59.100 --> 33:02.339
So I quit your service

33:02.340 --> 33:04.220
as of now.

33:10.300 --> 33:14.979
Your daughter is indeed
a very fine girl.

33:14.980 --> 33:16.259
She is an angel.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.739
Do you not fear for her?

33:18.740 --> 33:20.539
Such a pretty thing
out all alone

33:20.540 --> 33:22.219
on these dangerous streets.

33:22.220 --> 33:23.819
Of course I fear for her.

33:23.820 --> 33:25.979
I hear of abominable
things happening to girls

33:25.980 --> 33:29.219
just like her.

33:29.220 --> 33:34.019
Even you would not be so low
as to threaten my child.

33:34.020 --> 33:37.740
As long as you
remain in my employ.

33:41.660 --> 33:46.460
What a wonderful helpmeet
you are for your mother.

33:49.300 --> 33:54.700
I'm sure she'd be
inconsolable without you.

33:57.660 --> 34:00.660
I am your servant, Mrs. Quigley.

34:02.820 --> 34:05.019
He'll stiffen soon.

34:05.020 --> 34:06.659
We must remove him,

34:06.660 --> 34:08.699
as soon as it gets dark.

34:13.580 --> 34:16.938
What are you doing?
Taking my fee.

34:16.940 --> 34:19.699
We'll make it look like
he was set upon by thieves.

34:24.780 --> 34:27.418
Lucy, look after your mother.

34:27.420 --> 34:31.219
She just killed a man for you.

34:58.820 --> 35:00.940
You don't seem your usual self.

35:02.820 --> 35:05.219
In truth,

35:05.220 --> 35:08.020
I like you better
than any other man.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.819
Mr. Armitage...

35:12.820 --> 35:16.020
You're a balm for sore spirits.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.499
You all right?

35:37.500 --> 35:39.339
The offer you made me,

35:39.340 --> 35:40.659
to start again on another shore,

35:40.660 --> 35:42.499
was it real?

35:42.500 --> 35:44.499
Are you in earnest?

35:44.500 --> 35:48.499
You once told me that a harlot
did nothing but pretend.

35:48.500 --> 35:52.219
I can't pretend,
I want to leave.

35:52.220 --> 35:54.060
To leave London?

35:55.980 --> 35:57.300
With you.

36:07.340 --> 36:12.299
The way you sit,
watching her house.

36:12.300 --> 36:15.379
Your obsession
with her eats you.

36:15.380 --> 36:17.939
What is it born of?

36:17.940 --> 36:20.579
You took Margaret Wells
when she was a child.

36:20.580 --> 36:22.579
How can it be hate
that drives you?

36:22.580 --> 36:25.059
lt is love.
Enough of your impertinence,

36:25.060 --> 36:27.540
you sightless wretch.

36:32.460 --> 36:33.499
If you care for your mother,

36:33.500 --> 36:35.299
you will watch
that house all night.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.939
I will do nothing more for you.

36:37.940 --> 36:40.019
And when she discovers
that you kissed tongues

36:40.020 --> 36:44.099
with black harlots
at brothel masquerades,

36:44.100 --> 36:46.139
what then?

36:46.140 --> 36:48.460
Watch for Emily Lacey.

36:54.460 --> 36:57.379
Howard's dead, I'm sure of it.

36:57.380 --> 36:58.659
You need to be
far away from here

36:58.660 --> 37:03.339
before circumstance
imperils you.

37:03.340 --> 37:06.299
We need money.

37:06.300 --> 37:07.779
I wasn't lucky
at the tables tonight,

37:07.780 --> 37:09.379
how much do you have?

37:09.380 --> 37:11.019
What I'm in.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.139
But where are your savings?

37:13.140 --> 37:14.499
The gifts and the jewels,

37:14.500 --> 37:15.819
the wages from all the
nights you spent with him?

37:15.820 --> 37:16.939
I don't have any.

37:16.940 --> 37:18.379
You took nothing with you?
I couldn't.

37:18.380 --> 37:22.579
But he owes you!

37:22.580 --> 37:24.620
We can't arrive in
America with nothing.

37:26.540 --> 37:27.819
We're going to take
what you're due.

37:27.820 --> 37:29.059
No.

37:29.060 --> 37:31.339
I'm not watching you
gnawing with hunger

37:31.340 --> 37:34.420
or selling yourself to
every brute of New York.

37:37.140 --> 37:40.419
If you're in earnest,

37:40.420 --> 37:41.900
we need money.

37:54.580 --> 37:58.059
The whole street
will witness him leave.

37:58.060 --> 38:00.220
Deep in his cups.

38:05.180 --> 38:07.860
A fine night was had by all.

38:28.340 --> 38:31.099
Are you trying to
get my property out?

38:31.100 --> 38:33.299
I don't know where she is.

38:33.300 --> 38:36.579
Stop lying, little Maggie.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.020
Give me Emily.

38:45.900 --> 38:47.780
She's at Nancy's.

38:50.300 --> 38:52.380
That's my good girl.

38:55.860 --> 38:59.579
You always tell
Mumma the truth...

38:59.580 --> 39:01.100
in the end.

39:16.100 --> 39:17.819
Who was it?

39:17.820 --> 39:20.299
Scanwell and her daughter.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.500
I told her to go
and preach up my arse.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.619
Covent Garden.

39:29.620 --> 39:30.980
Very good, ma'am.

39:37.980 --> 39:39.419
Two shillings!

39:39.420 --> 39:40.499
Bobby!

39:40.500 --> 39:41.859
Leave me alone.
Bobby, I miss your

39:41.860 --> 39:43.179
dirty whorepipe.

39:43.180 --> 39:45.899
I want it up my
sweet nutmeg cunny.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.819
I can't be seen with you.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.819
There are eyes
everywhere watching.

39:49.820 --> 39:52.020
Well, then let's do it in a bed.

40:13.340 --> 40:14.499
Jacob.

40:14.500 --> 40:16.499
You cannot take the boy.

40:16.500 --> 40:19.339
We need a link boy
to light our way.

40:19.340 --> 40:21.940
Everything must look normal.

40:42.340 --> 40:44.419
I've come for my things.

40:44.420 --> 40:46.660
You do not live here anymore.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.899
Let's go.

40:50.900 --> 40:52.899
The lady's come
for her property.

40:52.900 --> 40:54.699
"Lady"?

40:54.700 --> 40:57.379
I see only a trollop.

40:57.380 --> 41:01.859
It's a mortal sin to defraud
a workman of his wages.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.419
Charlotte, get your things.

41:03.420 --> 41:04.820
Let's go.

41:06.180 --> 41:07.980
It doesn't matter.

41:10.660 --> 41:13.019
I hope she gives you pleasure,

41:13.020 --> 41:15.580
as she willingly gave me.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.780
Whatever will become
of you, Betsey?

41:35.020 --> 41:37.059
You're a mayfly.

41:37.060 --> 41:39.699
I worry that you'll
only live for a day...

41:39.700 --> 41:41.459
Yes, yes!

41:41.460 --> 41:42.899
Don't die.

41:42.900 --> 41:46.580
Don't die, don't die.

41:50.940 --> 41:52.299
No, Betsey!

41:52.300 --> 41:54.419
Tell your cull to help!

41:54.420 --> 41:55.939
Betsey!

41:55.940 --> 41:57.859
Please!

41:57.860 --> 41:59.420
No!

42:06.700 --> 42:09.099
Nohow did you find me?

42:09.100 --> 42:10.819
What hag told you I was here?

42:10.820 --> 42:13.060
Your dear friend Margaret Wells.

42:16.020 --> 42:17.219
No!

42:17.220 --> 42:19.220
Help me!

42:34.220 --> 42:36.219
So.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.220
We have nothing.

42:40.700 --> 42:44.219
That's not quite true, is it?

42:44.220 --> 42:46.619
You're right.

42:46.620 --> 42:50.060
I've found a treasure.
A cheap one.

43:09.580 --> 43:12.059
I don't know how to do this.

43:12.060 --> 43:14.859
I don't know how to mean it.

43:14.860 --> 43:17.100
How to be true.

43:19.300 --> 43:21.460
There's no money in the room.

43:23.860 --> 43:26.500
That should make it
simple enough.

44:58.020 --> 45:00.020
Is the man asleep?

45:01.940 --> 45:05.020
Yes, fast asleep.
