00:01.800 --> 00:04.170
NARRATOR:
A scientific breakthrough

00:04.300 --> 00:07.800
opens the door
to an entirely new reality.

00:07.930 --> 00:09.260
JEREMY CORBELL:
This technology

00:09.390 --> 00:12.520
can alter our world
beyond our wildest imagination.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.060
NARRATOR:
It has the potential

00:15.180 --> 00:18.190
to put every star in the sky
within our reach.

00:18.310 --> 00:21.190
MICHIO KAKU:
Variations of it could be stable

00:21.320 --> 00:23.360
and might eventually
provide fuel

00:23.480 --> 00:24.820
for a starship.

00:24.940 --> 00:27.660
NARRATOR:
But is it possible

00:27.780 --> 00:30.410
that this incredible technology
was ripped

00:30.530 --> 00:34.450
from a crashed
extraterrestrial spacecraft?

00:37.960 --> 00:41.130
It doesn't really coincide
with the aerodynamics

00:41.250 --> 00:42.590
-of a regular airplane.
-TRAVIS TAYLOR: Honestly,

00:42.710 --> 00:44.630
my skin is tingling from this.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.760
NARRATOR:
And if we harness
its awesome power,

00:47.880 --> 00:50.010
will we suddenly make
the giant leap

00:50.140 --> 00:52.300
from citizens of Earth

00:52.430 --> 00:55.020
to citizens of the universe?

00:55.140 --> 00:58.560
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
If you can manipulate
time and space

00:58.690 --> 01:00.350
through some kind of an element,

01:00.480 --> 01:01.900
you can do anything you want.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.530
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:06.650 --> 01:09.240
in the universe.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.120
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:13.870 --> 01:15.910
It demands
we question everything

01:16.040 --> 01:18.210
we have ever been taught.

01:18.330 --> 01:22.630
The evidence is all around us.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.960
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:26.090 --> 01:28.720
We are not alone.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.090
We have never <i>been alone.</i>

01:42.230 --> 01:43.980
Roswell, New Mexico.

01:44.110 --> 01:47.030
June 1947.

01:47.150 --> 01:49.570
On a dusty patch of desert

01:49.700 --> 01:52.160
30 miles north of town,

01:52.280 --> 01:55.620
an unidentified object
crashes to Earth.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.660
The initial press release

01:57.790 --> 02:00.460
from the Roswell Army Airfield
on July 8

02:00.580 --> 02:03.630
reports the recovery
of a flying disc.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.590
Curiously, the following day,

02:06.710 --> 02:08.630
the official story is changed

02:08.759 --> 02:12.970
to suggest it was nothing more
than a failed weather balloon.

02:13.090 --> 02:15.890
But more than six decades later,

02:16.010 --> 02:18.310
the FBI declassifies a memo

02:18.430 --> 02:21.230
dated March 22, 1950,

02:21.350 --> 02:25.060
in which FBI Director
J. Edgar Hoover is briefed

02:25.190 --> 02:27.900
not about the recovery
of one flying saucer,

02:28.030 --> 02:30.150
but three.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.490
We've all heard
the Roswell story

02:32.610 --> 02:34.570
about the Roswell crash in 1947

02:34.700 --> 02:36.450
and claims that bits
and pieces of it,

02:36.580 --> 02:38.540
of metal, this strange material,

02:38.660 --> 02:41.370
were picked up and stashed away
by the military.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.620
Over the years,
people have claimed

02:43.750 --> 02:45.000
there are other crashes.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.340
The reality is,

02:46.460 --> 02:47.750
if this technology exists

02:47.880 --> 02:49.920
and if we could figure out
how it works

02:50.050 --> 02:51.880
and if we could duplicate it,
I suspect

02:52.010 --> 02:54.050
that it would be put
to military uses

02:54.180 --> 02:55.340
and would never see
the light of day.

02:55.470 --> 02:57.100
At least not in my lifetime.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.930
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
The truth is that our government

03:00.060 --> 03:02.980
and other governments
have had retrieval of physics

03:03.100 --> 03:05.230
that they don't understand

03:05.350 --> 03:07.650
and they still don't understand
to this day.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.480
It is waiting

03:09.610 --> 03:13.280
for our physics
and our engineering to catch up

03:13.400 --> 03:17.320
to our even being able
to explore

03:17.450 --> 03:21.120
and understand the technology
we have retrieved.

03:23.460 --> 03:26.330
NARRATOR:
Is it possible
that the United States military

03:26.460 --> 03:27.790
really is in possession

03:27.920 --> 03:31.630
of one or more
crashed extraterrestrial craft?

03:31.760 --> 03:36.010
While the government has denied
such claims for decades,

03:36.140 --> 03:37.550
one man has come forward

03:37.680 --> 03:39.260
to say that he has seen
the evidence

03:39.390 --> 03:41.430
with his own eyes.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.350
My name's Bob Lazar.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.730
I'm known for working

03:47.860 --> 03:50.770
at a classified base known as S4

03:50.900 --> 03:54.150
out in the Nevada desert
near Area 51,

03:54.280 --> 03:58.820
and there we reverse engineered
alien spacecraft.

03:58.950 --> 04:01.950
In the late 1980s,

04:02.080 --> 04:06.290
the U.S. government
had recovered alien spacecraft,

04:06.420 --> 04:08.960
several of them,
and the technology.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.590
That's a fact.

04:10.710 --> 04:14.590
NARRATOR:
In May 1989, Bob Lazar,

04:14.720 --> 04:17.180
a physicist and former employee

04:17.300 --> 04:21.010
of Los Alamos National
Laboratory, first came forward

04:21.140 --> 04:23.850
with the incendiary news that
the government was conducting

04:23.970 --> 04:26.480
experiments at a top secret
installation

04:26.600 --> 04:28.690
known as Area 51.

04:30.610 --> 04:33.400
He admitted that the government
had not only recovered

04:33.530 --> 04:35.530
alien spacecraft at Roswell,

04:35.650 --> 04:38.660
but also validated
the persistent rumors

04:38.780 --> 04:41.620
of alien technology being
reverse engineered

04:41.740 --> 04:43.410
in the Nevada desert.

04:43.540 --> 04:48.540
Nearly three decades later,
in 2018,

04:48.670 --> 04:52.170
Bob Lazar once again told
his incredible story

04:52.290 --> 04:56.130
to documentary filmmaker
Jeremy Corbell.

04:56.260 --> 04:59.640
He said it's a secret that
needed to be told to the world,

04:59.760 --> 05:01.970
that his life was in danger,

05:02.100 --> 05:05.220
and that he was coming forward
and wanted to tell it.

05:05.350 --> 05:09.060
Area 51 is known all over
the world because of Bob Lazar.

05:09.190 --> 05:11.230
Whether people believe
his story or not,

05:11.360 --> 05:14.400
it put Area 51 on the map,
and it's never going away.

05:16.360 --> 05:20.490
NARRATOR:
For years, skeptics dismissed
Area 51 as pure fantasy,

05:20.610 --> 05:24.910
and attacked Lazar, calling him
a fraud and a liar.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.460
But in 2013, a Freedom
of Information Act request

05:29.580 --> 05:32.330
forced the CIA to come clean

05:32.460 --> 05:36.420
and admit that Area 51 is real.

05:36.550 --> 05:38.420
What they didn't acknowledge
about Area 51 was that

05:38.550 --> 05:41.760
it had anything to do with UFOs
or extraterrestrials.

05:43.430 --> 05:47.140
What they said was, Area 51 was
just a secret base

05:47.270 --> 05:49.390
for the U2 spy plane,

05:49.520 --> 05:52.730
which went into operation
around 1960.

05:52.860 --> 05:56.480
But now the government is
saying, oh, yes, we admit it.

05:56.610 --> 06:01.570
We've got Area 51, but there's
really nothing to see here.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.160
But researchers don't buy that
at all.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.500
There's so many stories of UFOs
and extraterrestrial activity

06:08.620 --> 06:12.080
around Area 51
that no one believes

06:12.210 --> 06:13.380
what the government is saying.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.340
NARRATOR:
According to Lazar,

06:16.460 --> 06:20.340
the notorious military base,
located northwest of Las Vegas,

06:20.470 --> 06:24.050
near Groom Lake, had an even
more top secret offshoot

06:24.180 --> 06:26.100
buried just to the south,

06:26.220 --> 06:30.730
deep under Papoose Mountain,
called S4.

06:30.850 --> 06:36.230
It was here that he claims the
U.S. Navy hid the alien saucers.

06:36.360 --> 06:40.360
They had a hangar hidden in the
desert to make it look like

06:40.490 --> 06:41.990
it was actually part
of the desert terrain.

06:43.990 --> 06:45.870
Officially,
there's nothing there.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.660
They've never had a facility,
that's what they'll tell you.

06:48.790 --> 06:51.910
You look at maps, you can see
roads that go from Groom Lake

06:52.040 --> 06:55.830
down to Papoose, so what
the heck was that for?

06:55.960 --> 06:59.960
NARRATOR:
By his account, the Navy
became aware of Lazar

07:00.090 --> 07:01.880
through his work at Los Alamos,

07:02.010 --> 07:05.550
and he was recruited for his
experience with particle physics

07:05.680 --> 07:07.600
and electronics.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.890
Lazar alleged that he was
funneled immediately

07:11.020 --> 07:13.690
into black project Galileo,

07:13.810 --> 07:16.190
and was tasked with
reverse engineering

07:16.310 --> 07:20.280
the propulsion system
of a flying saucer housed at S4

07:20.400 --> 07:23.360
that he referred to
as the "Sport Model."

07:23.490 --> 07:26.070
The science was something we
were trying to figure out,

07:26.200 --> 07:29.160
but we knew how the devices
would operate.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.750
You know, for instance,
the propulsion of the craft.

07:31.870 --> 07:34.920
It's a reactionless craft.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.130
It's a field-propulsion craft.

07:37.250 --> 07:40.500
And what it does is it creates
a distortion in space and time

07:40.630 --> 07:43.670
in front of it,
where space actually bends.

07:47.220 --> 07:49.390
NARRATOR:
Lazar said that
the crucial ingredient

07:49.510 --> 07:51.930
to make this incredible
technology work

07:52.060 --> 07:55.730
was an element that did not yet
exist on the periodic table;

07:55.850 --> 08:00.980
an element he mysteriously
referred to as "Element 115."

08:01.110 --> 08:03.490
At the time Lazar came forward,

08:03.610 --> 08:07.200
the periodic table-- a list of
all known chemical elements,

08:07.320 --> 08:10.660
arranged by atomic number,
electron configuration,

08:10.780 --> 08:13.080
and recurring chemical
properties--

08:13.200 --> 08:17.250
contained a total
of only 109 elements.

08:17.370 --> 08:21.340
He said that this heavy element
was the key

08:21.460 --> 08:24.840
to a propulsion system.

08:24.970 --> 08:28.260
Element 115 was the fuel

08:28.390 --> 08:32.929
by which interstellar travel
was made possible.

08:33.059 --> 08:35.679
It's really interesting,
as you look at the history

08:35.809 --> 08:39.020
of this reverse engineering
process that Lazar talks about,

08:39.150 --> 08:42.150
because there had to be a way
to get that technology here

08:42.270 --> 08:44.820
in the first place.

08:44.940 --> 08:47.150
Of course, most people think
it has something to do

08:47.280 --> 08:49.990
with the Roswell crash and other
crashes that may have happened.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.910
The bottom line is, it came
from an alien source,

08:53.040 --> 08:54.950
and we have to figure out
what to do with it

08:55.080 --> 08:57.040
to our best benefit.

08:58.540 --> 09:00.580
NARRATOR:
Is the Navy in possession of

09:00.710 --> 09:03.710
not only extraterrestrial
spacecraft,

09:03.840 --> 09:08.800
but its fuel source...
Element 115?

09:12.260 --> 09:15.890
July 18, 2017,

09:16.020 --> 09:18.810
Laingsburg, Michigan.

09:21.480 --> 09:25.690
While producing his documentary
about Bob Lazar and Area 51,

09:25.820 --> 09:29.200
independent filmmaker
Jeremy Corbell asks

09:29.320 --> 09:32.620
if the former government
physicist knows of the location

09:32.740 --> 09:34.990
of Element 115.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.460
CORBELL:
Did you ever get a piece of
Element 115 out of Los Alamos?

09:43.090 --> 09:46.130
NARRATOR:
If a piece of Element 115
did exist,

09:46.250 --> 09:48.470
it would provide
the first tangible evidence

09:48.590 --> 09:50.930
that the U.S. government
is in possession of

09:51.050 --> 09:53.600
extraterrestrial technology.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.560
Element 115 would be
proof positive

09:55.680 --> 09:56.970
that he's telling the truth.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.600
If you could get a piece of it,

09:58.730 --> 10:01.520
it would be proof
that it's alien.

10:01.650 --> 10:02.940
(chiming)

10:03.060 --> 10:04.520
NARRATOR:
The day after the interview,

10:04.650 --> 10:08.650
Corbell received word from Lazar
that he had been presented

10:08.780 --> 10:13.200
a search warrant by the FBI for
his business, United Nuclear.

10:13.320 --> 10:17.160
According to Lazar, they claimed
that they were looking for

10:17.290 --> 10:19.700
two-year-old paperwork
concerning a customer

10:19.830 --> 10:22.830
that ordered some potentially
toxic material.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.540
CORBELL:
I started getting
a bunch of texts.

10:25.670 --> 10:28.760
He's being raided,
not just by the FBI,

10:28.880 --> 10:30.720
by multiple agencies.

10:30.840 --> 10:34.640
Forensic collection agents,
people mirroring computers.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.600
They turned his business
upside down.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.680
And I've talked to a number
of federal agents.

10:38.810 --> 10:42.060
Their job is to do operations
like this.

10:42.190 --> 10:46.520
You do not go for a full
turnover of a place of business

10:46.650 --> 10:48.020
for paperwork;
you make a phone call.

10:48.150 --> 10:50.740
NARRATOR:
Bob Lazar never provided

10:50.860 --> 10:53.660
an answer to the question
of whether he was in possession

10:53.780 --> 10:55.530
of Element 115.

10:55.660 --> 10:57.700
But why?

10:57.830 --> 11:00.870
Could it be that the FBI
was listening in?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
If so, did they raid
his business in an attempt

11:04.120 --> 11:07.500
to find the answer
for themselves?

11:07.630 --> 11:09.340
But more importantly,

11:09.460 --> 11:11.420
if his story is true,

11:11.550 --> 11:15.220
what are the implications
for humankind?

11:15.340 --> 11:18.430
Some scientists suggest
that if the U.S. government

11:18.560 --> 11:22.810
is in possession of the type of
technology Bob Lazar described,

11:22.930 --> 11:25.440
it could lead to
the greatest technological leap

11:25.560 --> 11:27.940
in human history.

11:33.570 --> 11:35.490
♪ ♪

11:37.950 --> 11:41.120
NARRATOR:
Moscow, 1963.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.120
Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev

11:45.250 --> 11:47.750
examines an unidentified
radio emission

11:47.880 --> 11:51.170
coming from a quasar
named CTA-102.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.420
(whirring, crackling)

11:52.550 --> 11:54.470
It is the first
official Soviet effort

11:54.590 --> 11:58.260
in the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence.

11:58.390 --> 12:00.810
And it inspires Kardashev
to speculate

12:00.930 --> 12:03.560
that alien civilizations
could exist

12:03.680 --> 12:04.980
that are millions--

12:05.100 --> 12:07.480
or even billions--
of years ahead of us.

12:08.940 --> 12:12.530
He creates what is known
as the Kardashev scale,

12:12.650 --> 12:17.110
a classification scheme ranking
three levels of civilizations,

12:17.240 --> 12:19.990
based on their ability
to harness energy.

12:22.790 --> 12:25.040
A Type I civilization
has the energy

12:25.160 --> 12:27.040
of an entire planet.

12:27.170 --> 12:29.000
They might, for example,
control the weather--

12:29.130 --> 12:30.500
earthquakes, volcanoes.

12:30.630 --> 12:32.420
They can modify them.

12:32.550 --> 12:33.670
They have the power of a planet.

12:33.800 --> 12:34.840
That's Type I.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.300
A Type II civilization

12:38.430 --> 12:40.680
has mastered the energy
of a star.

12:42.390 --> 12:44.270
They've colonized
the nearby planets,

12:44.390 --> 12:48.230
very similar to the Federation
of Planets like in <i>Star Trek.</i>

12:48.350 --> 12:50.940
<i>Star Trek would be
a Type II civilization.</i>

12:51.060 --> 12:52.520
Then there's Type III.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.860
Galactic.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.820
They roam
the galactic space lanes.

12:59.950 --> 13:01.990
They harness the power
of black holes.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.000
That's like the Empire
of <i>Star Wars.</i>

13:05.120 --> 13:07.500
That would be
a Type III civilization.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.210
Now, on this cosmic scale,
what are we?

13:10.330 --> 13:12.340
Do we control the Earth?

13:12.460 --> 13:15.010
Do we control the stars?
Do we control the galaxy?

13:15.130 --> 13:17.130
We are Type 0.

13:17.260 --> 13:19.430
We get our energy
from dead plants.

13:20.970 --> 13:22.720
NARRATOR:
Some scientists suggest

13:22.850 --> 13:24.760
that if humans
were even to ascend

13:24.890 --> 13:28.180
to what Kardashev called
a Type I civilization,

13:28.310 --> 13:31.020
our current understanding
of the laws of the universe

13:31.150 --> 13:33.690
would be dramatically altered.

13:33.820 --> 13:36.360
KAKU:
Now, some of my colleagues say,

13:36.480 --> 13:39.200
"Bah. Humbug.
The stars are so far away,

13:39.320 --> 13:42.200
aliens can't possibly reach us."

13:42.320 --> 13:44.740
But that assumes
that they're just Type I.

13:44.870 --> 13:48.330
What happens if they are
a thousand years ahead of us?

13:48.460 --> 13:50.580
Or, for a Type III civilization,

13:50.710 --> 13:53.750
a hundred thousand years
more advanced than us?

13:53.880 --> 13:56.590
Then new laws of physics

13:56.710 --> 13:58.970
begin to open up,

13:59.090 --> 14:03.050
and all the "bah humbugs" have
to be thrown out the window,

14:03.180 --> 14:05.970
because a new scale
of physics emerges

14:06.100 --> 14:09.140
once you are Type II
or Type III.

14:09.270 --> 14:12.600
NARRATOR:
There are several
theoretical physicists

14:12.730 --> 14:15.020
who believe that once
humans achieve the status

14:15.150 --> 14:17.230
of a Type I civilization,

14:17.360 --> 14:19.990
evolving to Type II
and colonizing other planets

14:20.110 --> 14:22.110
will happen quickly

14:22.240 --> 14:25.990
and will be akin
to our leap from ape to human.

14:27.490 --> 14:29.790
If so,
could Bob Lazar's accounts

14:29.910 --> 14:32.790
of reverse engineered
alien spacecraft

14:32.920 --> 14:35.130
signal a revolutionary
turning point

14:35.250 --> 14:37.750
in human evolution?

14:37.880 --> 14:40.760
Perhaps further clues
can be found

14:40.880 --> 14:43.800
by examining a recent
scientific breakthrough.

14:49.270 --> 14:50.770
Dubna, Russia.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.690
August 10, 2003.

14:53.810 --> 14:57.110
Russian and U.S.
nuclear physicists

14:57.230 --> 14:59.730
at the Joint Institute
for Nuclear Research

14:59.860 --> 15:02.570
shoot a beam of calcium atoms
at a target

15:02.700 --> 15:06.450
of element 95, americium,

15:06.570 --> 15:09.540
inside a particle accelerator.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.290
(whooshing, crackling)

15:11.410 --> 15:13.290
The collision results
in the creation

15:13.420 --> 15:15.710
of the heaviest atom
ever observed:

15:15.830 --> 15:18.130
Element 115.

15:20.090 --> 15:23.170
Because Element 115 is
highly unstable,

15:23.300 --> 15:27.350
it exists in stable form for
only a fraction of a second

15:27.470 --> 15:31.520
before disintegrating
into radioactive fragments.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.520
But could this be the very same
element that Bob Lazar said

15:35.650 --> 15:38.690
was the fuel source
for an extraterrestrial craft?

15:40.690 --> 15:43.320
NARRATOR: Some physicists
believe that if they can produce

15:43.450 --> 15:46.320
a stable form of this newly
synthesized element,

15:46.450 --> 15:49.330
it has the potential to
facilitate the greatest

15:49.450 --> 15:54.000
technological leap
in human history.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.790
Most of these elements,
beyond uranium,

15:55.920 --> 15:58.290
only exist for
a fraction of a second.

15:58.420 --> 16:00.130
They're there,
and then they're gone again.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.510
But we physicists think

16:03.630 --> 16:07.050
that we can make use of it
to create nuclear energy

16:07.180 --> 16:10.810
on a much more efficient scale
than plutonium...

16:10.930 --> 16:15.190
and that variations of it
could be stable,

16:15.310 --> 16:19.310
and might eventually provide
fuel for a starship.

16:19.440 --> 16:24.650
This technology can absolutely,
instantaneously alter our world

16:24.780 --> 16:26.780
beyond our wildest imagination.

16:26.910 --> 16:29.070
And it could do so so rapidly

16:29.200 --> 16:33.330
that it would be a shock
to the human consciousness.

16:33.450 --> 16:38.290
So, the idea is to study
these technologies

16:38.420 --> 16:41.750
and try to get parts of it
that will benefit humanity.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.880
NARRATOR:
Mainstream scientists believe
stabilizing enough Moscovium

16:48.010 --> 16:49.930
to power an
intergalactic spacecraft

16:50.050 --> 16:52.220
is still decades away.

16:52.350 --> 16:56.520
But the question remains:
could this Element 115

16:56.640 --> 17:00.610
be the same Element 115 that
Bob Lazar claims was recovered

17:00.730 --> 17:02.610
by the U.S. military?

17:04.900 --> 17:07.650
It has always been theorized
that Element 115 itself

17:07.780 --> 17:10.569
does exist, but we hadn't
physically made it ourselves

17:10.700 --> 17:12.280
until 2003.

17:12.410 --> 17:16.910
However, the Element 115 that
Bob Lazar had his hands on,

17:17.040 --> 17:20.210
that had a different
isotopic ratio

17:20.329 --> 17:22.339
that allowed it
to be stabilized.

17:22.460 --> 17:25.000
(explosion)

17:25.130 --> 17:28.089
NARRATOR:
While scientists suggest
that it may be possible

17:28.220 --> 17:30.510
to create a stable version
of Moscovium,

17:30.640 --> 17:33.850
there are some who believe
this newly synthesized element

17:33.970 --> 17:35.850
is simply a decoy.

17:35.970 --> 17:39.980
Could it be that some secret
government agency arranged

17:40.100 --> 17:42.770
for the introduction of this
highly unstable element

17:42.900 --> 17:45.730
in order to convince the public

17:45.860 --> 17:47.780
that the Element 115

17:47.900 --> 17:52.450
Bob Lazar described...
does not exist?

17:52.570 --> 17:55.870
Whenever somebody makes
a bizarre claim

17:55.990 --> 18:00.330
that's written off for science
fiction, like Element 115 was,

18:00.460 --> 18:04.920
and then, years later,
the science catches up,

18:05.040 --> 18:07.170
and it's,
"Oh, yeah, he was right.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.550
There is an Element 115, and
we've just manufactured some."

18:10.680 --> 18:15.390
Well, it's the idea that
this is disinformation.

18:15.510 --> 18:18.640
And they'll be saying it's one
of these heavy elements

18:18.770 --> 18:22.310
that's only stable for
a very short period of time.

18:22.440 --> 18:25.230
That simply can't be
the real fuel

18:25.360 --> 18:29.190
by which interstellar travel
was made possible.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.700
He's making it up.

18:30.820 --> 18:33.280
Therefore, he's not divulging
anything classified.

18:33.410 --> 18:37.910
But when this announcement
was first made,

18:38.040 --> 18:39.700
some people said,
"Wait a minute.

18:39.830 --> 18:44.290
"If Bob Lazar was right
about Element 115,

18:44.420 --> 18:46.210
what else was he right about?"

18:47.960 --> 18:49.920
NARRATOR:
For ancient astronaut theorists,

18:50.050 --> 18:53.260
the fact that an Element 115
has now been added

18:53.380 --> 18:55.220
to the periodic table,

18:55.350 --> 18:58.220
and that scientists are
already speculating

18:58.350 --> 19:01.230
about how it might be used
for space travel,

19:01.350 --> 19:05.610
seems to lend further credence
to Bob Lazar's claims.

19:05.730 --> 19:10.190
But if the military really did
recover a stabilized version

19:10.320 --> 19:13.610
of Element 115
from a crashed alien craft,

19:13.740 --> 19:16.370
did they come upon it by chance,

19:16.490 --> 19:18.910
or could it have been
given to us

19:19.040 --> 19:21.910
as part of an
extraterrestrial agenda?

19:28.040 --> 19:31.420
NARRATOR:
October 18, 1947.

19:31.550 --> 19:36.470
The Astrakhan Region
of the former Soviet Union.

19:38.550 --> 19:40.470
From a military aerospace
development lab

19:40.600 --> 19:43.060
known as Kapustin Yar,

19:43.180 --> 19:46.900
scientists successfully launch
their first long-range

19:47.020 --> 19:51.570
ballistic missile:
a German A4 rocket.

19:51.690 --> 19:55.410
For the next decade,
this will be the Soviet Union's

19:55.530 --> 19:58.490
only test site
for ballistic missiles,

19:58.620 --> 20:01.120
and the beginning
of a space program

20:01.240 --> 20:04.250
that put the first satellite
and the first human being

20:04.370 --> 20:06.120
into space.

20:06.250 --> 20:09.920
Curiously, in 1948,

20:10.040 --> 20:13.170
Kapustin Yar was also the site
of the Soviet Union's

20:13.300 --> 20:17.090
first reported UFO encounter.

20:17.220 --> 20:22.180
On June 19, 1948,
a cigar-shaped object

20:22.310 --> 20:25.480
was detected by Soviet radar.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.400
A silverish,
cigar-shaped object,

20:28.520 --> 20:32.190
uh, appeared over
the testing grounds.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.190
And, um, the Soviets tried
to shoot it down.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.910
It's a highly classified case.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.530
We don't know exactly
what happened,

20:41.660 --> 20:43.160
but, allegedly, they were able

20:43.290 --> 20:45.370
to actually shoot
this object down.

20:49.380 --> 20:52.500
They found remnants
of bodies in it,

20:52.630 --> 20:54.670
and also technology,

20:54.800 --> 20:58.890
which was recovered and taken
to the local bunker,

20:59.010 --> 21:01.680
where they kept it,
allegedly, for years,

21:01.800 --> 21:05.020
and used it to reverse engineer
some of the technology.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.400
NARRATOR:
The Kapustin Yar incident
allegedly took place

21:11.520 --> 21:14.110
within a year of the famous
Roswell event.

21:18.240 --> 21:22.200
Both the CIA and the Soviet MGB
intelligence agency

21:22.330 --> 21:25.540
took interest in what might have
crashed and been retrieved

21:25.660 --> 21:26.910
in enemy territory.

21:29.620 --> 21:32.000
STONEHILL:
You had American agents

21:32.130 --> 21:33.800
trying to find out

21:33.920 --> 21:36.130
what were the objects
flying over the Soviet Union.

21:36.260 --> 21:38.090
At the same time,
you had the Roswell incident

21:38.220 --> 21:39.800
in the United States.

21:41.510 --> 21:44.760
I can tell you that Stalin
was very much interested,

21:44.890 --> 21:49.100
and he had espionage information
delivered by his agents to him.

21:49.230 --> 21:50.650
We have proof of that.

21:50.770 --> 21:53.190
And he questioned
Soviet academicians

21:53.310 --> 21:54.770
about the veracity

21:54.900 --> 21:57.440
of UFO threat to his country.

22:00.070 --> 22:02.700
NARRATOR:
If stories of UFO crashes
and retrievals

22:02.820 --> 22:06.620
in both the United States
and the Soviet Union are true,

22:06.740 --> 22:08.790
could it have led
to a collaboration

22:08.910 --> 22:12.540
between the world's
only two superpowers?

22:12.670 --> 22:15.840
And considering the fact
that the alleged incidents

22:15.960 --> 22:18.050
took place
within a year of each other,

22:18.170 --> 22:22.130
might it have been part
of an extraterrestrial agenda?

22:24.970 --> 22:25.970
WILLIAM HENRY:
If there's a motivation

22:26.100 --> 22:27.520
of aliens or extraterrestrials

22:27.640 --> 22:30.430
in bringing
these two superpowers together,

22:30.560 --> 22:32.060
it's to wake us up,

22:32.190 --> 22:34.230
to recognize that,
hey, once we get past

22:34.360 --> 22:36.520
all the artificial lines
and borders on our planet

22:36.650 --> 22:38.110
and get out into space...

22:38.230 --> 22:41.360
That is the hope and promise
of this collaboration.

22:46.030 --> 22:48.240
NARRATOR:
If extraterrestrial spacecraft

22:48.370 --> 22:50.450
were purposely crashed
in both the United States

22:50.580 --> 22:52.330
and the Soviet Union

22:52.460 --> 22:54.920
more than 70 years ago,

22:55.040 --> 22:57.800
has the study of them led
to technological breakthroughs

22:57.920 --> 23:01.220
that have been kept hidden
from the public?

23:01.340 --> 23:03.380
And where have
these alien visitors been

23:03.510 --> 23:06.510
during the seven decades
that have passed?

23:06.640 --> 23:09.520
-(beeping)
-Ancient astronaut theorists
believe

23:09.640 --> 23:11.850
they have been here all along

23:11.980 --> 23:14.150
and that recent events suggest

23:14.270 --> 23:18.480
they are ready to make
their presence known to humanity

23:18.610 --> 23:21.530
once again.

23:23.570 --> 23:27.620
November 14, 2004.

23:29.120 --> 23:33.210
100 miles off the coast
of Southern California,

23:33.330 --> 23:37.540
fighter pilots with the USS
<i>Nimitz Carrier Strike Group</i>

23:37.670 --> 23:41.380
engage incoming
unidentified flying craft.

23:46.470 --> 23:47.470
(laughs)

23:47.600 --> 23:49.060
11 years later,

23:49.180 --> 23:51.180
in 2015,

23:51.310 --> 23:54.810
U.S. fighter pilots engage
yet another UFO.

23:56.190 --> 23:58.270
PILOT:
Well, if there's...

24:04.400 --> 24:06.410
NARRATOR:
The accompanying report revealed

24:06.530 --> 24:08.490
fighter pilot accounts
of the craft

24:08.620 --> 24:11.580
descending from altitudes
of 60,000 feet

24:11.700 --> 24:14.830
to 50 feet
in a matter of seconds,

24:14.960 --> 24:19.880
hovering or staying stationary
on radar for short times,

24:20.000 --> 24:23.420
departing at high velocities
and turn rates,

24:23.550 --> 24:26.590
and even cloaking.

24:26.720 --> 24:29.970
The release of what became known
as the GIMBAL video

24:30.100 --> 24:32.060
was one of the most significant
disclosures

24:32.180 --> 24:35.560
of government encounters
with UFOs.

24:35.690 --> 24:37.730
In the description,
you're talking about maneuvers

24:37.850 --> 24:39.730
that would literally crush
the spacecraft

24:39.860 --> 24:41.150
and kill any occupant.

24:41.270 --> 24:42.940
The only way
you can circumvent that

24:43.070 --> 24:45.440
is if there's some sort
of inertia dampening field

24:45.570 --> 24:47.110
around the craft itself,

24:47.240 --> 24:49.240
and-and that is,
as far as we know,

24:49.370 --> 24:51.830
a technology that doesn't
yet exist on this planet.

24:55.290 --> 24:57.960
Reminiscent of the "Sport Model"
Bob Lazar claims

24:58.080 --> 25:00.880
to have worked on at Area 51 S4,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.750
some of the crafts described
in the DoD report

25:03.880 --> 25:06.050
were smooth, with no edges,

25:06.170 --> 25:08.630
uniformly colored
with no nacelles,

25:08.760 --> 25:10.550
pylons, or wings,

25:10.680 --> 25:14.270
and were approximately 46 feet
in length.

25:14.390 --> 25:16.020
According to Lazar,

25:16.140 --> 25:18.060
at the core of its design

25:18.190 --> 25:22.360
was a nuclear reactor powered
by element 115.

25:24.530 --> 25:26.610
Element 115 was

25:26.740 --> 25:28.070
what we would call the fuel

25:28.200 --> 25:30.110
that provided the power
for the reactor to work.

25:30.240 --> 25:32.660
Element 115 affects gravity.

25:32.780 --> 25:38.080
Element 115 produces
its own gravitational energy.

25:38.210 --> 25:41.130
The resulting gravity wave
creates a distortion

25:41.250 --> 25:42.380
in front of it,

25:42.500 --> 25:45.800
allowing the craft
to slide forward.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.470
And that's how it proceeds.

25:47.590 --> 25:49.930
NARRATOR:
Although Lazar is adamant

25:50.050 --> 25:52.850
that he observed
the Sport Model in flight,

25:52.970 --> 25:55.350
skeptics argue
that antigravity propulsion

25:55.470 --> 25:58.310
is the stuff of science fiction.

25:59.390 --> 26:00.940
Or is it?

26:05.070 --> 26:07.400
NARRATOR:
Los Angeles, California.

26:08.490 --> 26:11.950
March 9, 2019.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.660
Dissatisfied with
mainstream scientific analysis

26:15.790 --> 26:18.000
of the DoD GIMBAL video,

26:18.120 --> 26:21.960
author and ancient astronaut
theorist Mike Bara invited

26:22.080 --> 26:25.800
astrophysicist and aerospace
engineer Dr. Travis Taylor

26:25.920 --> 26:30.930
to participate in an evaluation
of the DoD's footage.

26:31.050 --> 26:34.430
They are also curious
about the potential connection

26:34.550 --> 26:36.600
between
the extraordinary movements

26:36.720 --> 26:39.230
of the UFO craft depicted

26:39.350 --> 26:42.390
and what Bob Lazar reported
as the unique properties

26:42.520 --> 26:44.060
of what he is convinced

26:44.190 --> 26:46.940
was a captured
extraterrestrial spacecraft

26:47.070 --> 26:50.240
powered by element 115.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.110
BARA:
So here's the thing, though.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.490
If you assume the pilots
are telling the truth,

26:54.620 --> 26:56.780
and if you assume the DoD
is telling the truth...

26:56.910 --> 26:58.410
Right.

26:58.540 --> 27:01.080
...then don't you have
a much stronger case

27:01.210 --> 27:03.960
for something unusual being
present on these videos?

27:04.080 --> 27:07.290
Yeah, so, if you make
all those assumptions,

27:07.420 --> 27:10.210
then you have this craft
in this video

27:10.340 --> 27:14.010
that is performing
outside of our abilities

27:14.140 --> 27:17.680
to manipulate physics
with aerospace vehicles today.

27:17.810 --> 27:21.180
NARRATOR:
Travis Taylor has worked
on various programs

27:21.310 --> 27:23.390
for the United States
Department of Defense

27:23.520 --> 27:25.940
and NASA for over 16 years.

27:26.060 --> 27:27.690
TAYLOR:
I'm an optical scientist,

27:27.820 --> 27:30.070
an aerospace engineer,
an astronomer and a physicist,

27:30.190 --> 27:33.280
and I've worked in the aerospace
and defense industry

27:33.400 --> 27:35.200
since I was 17 years old.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.280
And it's intriguing that
a lot of people are saying

27:37.410 --> 27:40.830
that this GIMBAL video
is something

27:40.950 --> 27:43.710
like what Bob Lazar
claims to have worked on.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.670
NARRATOR:
Mike Bara has
written numerous books

27:46.790 --> 27:49.590
about U.S. and international
space programs,

27:49.710 --> 27:54.260
and has done extensive research
into aviation technology.

27:54.380 --> 27:56.930
The thing to me that's really
interesting about this video

27:57.050 --> 27:59.720
is the fact that it actually
encourages people

27:59.850 --> 28:02.060
to believe that these
are alien spacecraft.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.310
Now, why would the government
want to do that?

28:04.440 --> 28:07.770
NARRATOR:
For Mike and Travis,
the first step in analyzing

28:07.900 --> 28:11.980
the DoD footage is to determine
whether it is genuine

28:12.110 --> 28:13.990
or could have been fabricated.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.450
To assist them in this effort,

28:16.570 --> 28:19.030
they have turned
to a master of illusion...

28:19.160 --> 28:20.830
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:20.950 --> 28:23.580
NARRATOR: ...Hollywood visual
effects supervisor Sam Edwards.

28:23.700 --> 28:24.910
-Nice to to meet you.
-How you doing, Travis?

28:25.040 --> 28:27.080
-Well, thanks for having us.
-Yeah, it's great.

28:27.210 --> 28:29.290
-Yeah, come on, after you.
Yeah. Perfect.
-This way?

28:29.420 --> 28:32.000
-Here's the screening room.
Yeah.
-Wow. This is great.

28:32.130 --> 28:33.260
EDWARDS:
Have a seat anywhere.

28:35.090 --> 28:37.010
TAYLOR:
So,

28:37.130 --> 28:39.260
do you think
that you and your team

28:39.390 --> 28:41.890
could go and recreate a video
that looked authentic,

28:42.010 --> 28:46.020
like, it came from, you know,
the F/A-18 gun camera

28:46.140 --> 28:48.190
from, you know,
2004 or whatever?

28:48.310 --> 28:50.860
Listen, I-I'm in
the visual effects business,

28:50.980 --> 28:53.530
right, and we don't ever say no.

28:53.650 --> 28:55.150
-Right, right.
-Right?

28:55.280 --> 28:58.360
But you know the joke is
about the, the moon landing is?

28:58.490 --> 29:00.410
It must be real
because Hollywood

29:00.530 --> 29:01.740
would never
make something so boring.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.240
-Right. Good point.
-Right?

29:03.370 --> 29:06.910
So there's no mediation at all
to this image, right?

29:08.040 --> 29:09.830
It couldn't be more dull.

29:09.960 --> 29:13.630
It's just, technically, this
is in there and that's in there.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.710
There's nobody's artistic vision
at all.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.680
That's, uh, that to me
is one of the best arguments

29:18.800 --> 29:20.840
-right there for it,
that makes perfect sense.
-Right?

29:20.970 --> 29:23.930
NARRATOR:
While there is no way
to determine for certain

29:24.060 --> 29:25.390
that the video
wasn't fabricated,

29:25.520 --> 29:28.310
based on what they are seeing,

29:28.440 --> 29:30.650
as well as the pilot's
eyewitness corroboration,

29:30.770 --> 29:33.520
Mike, Travis and Sam
are convinced

29:33.650 --> 29:36.280
that the footage is genuine.

29:36.400 --> 29:40.240
If true,
the implications are profound,

29:40.360 --> 29:43.030
as even some military personnel
are of the opinion

29:43.160 --> 29:46.290
that the maneuvers displayed
by the craft in the GIMBAL video

29:46.410 --> 29:50.120
resemble no known
man-made technology.

29:50.250 --> 29:52.290
TAYLOR:
So now the next question is,

29:52.420 --> 29:54.630
-is the origin
of that advanced propulsion.
-BARA: Right.

29:54.750 --> 29:55.840
Is it man-made
advanced propulsion

29:55.960 --> 29:57.970
or is it extraterrestrial?

29:58.090 --> 30:00.130
EDWARDS:
Let's try to reverse engineer
what's there

30:00.260 --> 30:01.680
and understand
what we're looking at.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.800
So, yeah,
it's air-to-air footage,

30:03.930 --> 30:06.100
and I thought
that was kind of cool.

30:07.470 --> 30:09.640
I stabilized out
some of the camera motion

30:09.770 --> 30:12.810
so we can kind of get a better
feel for its trajectory.

30:12.940 --> 30:14.940
Oh, okay.

30:15.070 --> 30:16.690
-EDWARDS: Wow, yeah.
-That's cool.

30:16.820 --> 30:19.190
EDWARDS:
That tells us how much
it's actually moving.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.200
Which, it doesn't seem to me
to be supersonic

30:21.320 --> 30:24.580
-or anything like it.
-TAYLOR: If you look at that,

30:24.700 --> 30:29.120
it looks to me like there is
structure in a couple of places.

30:29.250 --> 30:31.750
Uh, now we're below it, right?

30:31.870 --> 30:36.590
Something right in here and here
and then something here.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.840
-EDWARDS: Mm-hmm.
-The interesting thing here is,

30:38.960 --> 30:41.130
if you were looking
at a SR-71 and it was below you

30:41.260 --> 30:44.220
and you were looking down at it,
the wings would look

30:44.350 --> 30:46.720
sort of disc-shaped like that,
and there would be a tail

30:46.850 --> 30:48.470
and there would be
a nose structure

30:48.600 --> 30:50.980
-and these would be your wings.
-EDWARDS: If that's a wing then,

30:51.100 --> 30:53.600
what's-what's going on now?

30:53.730 --> 30:58.070
Right? It's still traveling
in the same direction.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.070
TAYLOR:
It-it looks a lot
like a top, doesn't it?

31:00.190 --> 31:02.200
-(chuckles)
-It doesn't really coincide

31:02.320 --> 31:05.070
with the aerodynamics
of a regular airplane.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.700
The fighter pilots they,
they can roll, they can pitch,

31:07.830 --> 31:10.700
they can crab, they can yaw,
they can do all sorts of things

31:10.830 --> 31:13.170
to an airplane
to make it look unusual.

31:13.290 --> 31:15.040
EDWARDS:
I-I hear what you're saying,

31:15.170 --> 31:18.340
and, uh, we made
a, uh, CG model.

31:18.460 --> 31:22.380
And I kind of hand-tracked it
to sort of match its motion

31:22.510 --> 31:26.510
so we can kind of get a feel for
what some of its dimensions are.

31:26.640 --> 31:30.020
TAYLOR:
Yeah, it's interesting,
if it's looking straight on

31:30.140 --> 31:34.400
like your model there, your
model matches to it pretty good.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.060
Well, let me show you
something else

31:36.190 --> 31:37.650
that catches my eye, gentlemen.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.780
What seems odd to me,

31:39.900 --> 31:43.400
this kind of light
that follows behind the craft.

31:43.530 --> 31:46.490
There's no such thing
as a light source

31:46.620 --> 31:49.450
that follows around
behind an aircraft.

31:49.580 --> 31:52.000
TAYLOR:
Right, because
it's clearly there,

31:52.120 --> 31:54.290
-now that you point it-- I can't
believe I didn't see it before.
-Yeah.

31:54.420 --> 31:57.670
TAYLOR:
So the system
is in black hot mode.

31:57.790 --> 32:01.130
What that tells me: if black
is hot, there's a cold region.

32:01.260 --> 32:04.260
-EDWARDS: Mm-hmm.
-A cold region
around the vehicle.

32:04.380 --> 32:05.800
Thing about this, a cold region

32:05.930 --> 32:08.890
around a propulsion system
is odd.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.930
You typically are gonna be,
you know, warm

32:12.060 --> 32:14.060
coming out of the exhaust
or near your engine.

32:14.180 --> 32:15.520
Doesn't that argue that it's not

32:15.640 --> 32:17.100
a conventional
propulsion system?

32:23.280 --> 32:26.280
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorist Mike Bara

32:26.410 --> 32:29.070
and aerospace engineer
Travis Taylor

32:29.200 --> 32:31.330
are meeting with Hollywood
visual effects supervisor

32:31.450 --> 32:34.120
Sam Edwards
in order to examine footage

32:34.250 --> 32:38.080
of a UFO taken by
a U.S. Navy pilot.

32:38.210 --> 32:42.500
They are also curious about
the possible connections

32:42.630 --> 32:45.720
between the UFO craft depicted
in the footage,

32:45.840 --> 32:47.630
and the reported properties

32:47.760 --> 32:50.800
of the mysterious element
known as 115.

32:50.930 --> 32:52.930
EDWARDS:
On my monitor I'm taking

32:53.060 --> 32:56.390
that broader dynamic range image

32:56.520 --> 32:58.480
and I'm looking at different
parts of the spectrum.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.190
BARA:
I mean, you can see that field

33:01.320 --> 33:03.190
-right around that thing.
-EDWARDS: Yeah, exactly.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.610
BARA:
It's not jet engines?
I mean, look,

33:04.740 --> 33:05.740
-let's talk about what...
-If we make the assumption

33:05.860 --> 33:07.700
that it's not
the camera phenomenon,

33:07.820 --> 33:10.030
that it is something to do
with the propulsion system,

33:10.160 --> 33:12.030
then it's describing to me

33:12.160 --> 33:14.540
something like
an Alcubierre warp bubble.

33:17.210 --> 33:19.420
NARRATOR:
An Alcubierre warp bubble

33:19.540 --> 33:22.960
is a theoretical model
for transporting a spaceship

33:23.090 --> 33:24.960
by contracting space
in front of it

33:25.090 --> 33:27.630
and expanding space behind it.

33:27.760 --> 33:32.050
A bubble of curved space
would form around the craft,

33:32.180 --> 33:34.350
and in an atmosphere
like that of Earth,

33:34.470 --> 33:36.480
the air temperature inside
the bubble

33:36.600 --> 33:38.810
would be significantly cooler

33:38.940 --> 33:41.770
than the surrounding
atmospheric air,

33:41.900 --> 33:45.360
so much cooler that an infrared
camera would detect it.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.400
This makes it possible
for the craft

33:47.530 --> 33:49.530
to travel faster
than the speed of light

33:49.660 --> 33:52.320
without breaking any
of the laws of physics.

33:52.450 --> 33:55.450
BARA:
Here's the thing,

33:55.580 --> 33:58.040
this is exactly the technology
that Bob Lazar talked about

33:58.160 --> 34:00.870
with his "Sport Model"
from Area 51.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.960
What he said was happening was
that you're simply distorting

34:04.090 --> 34:05.750
the gravity field like this,

34:05.880 --> 34:07.340
so you can kind of surf
along this wave.

34:07.460 --> 34:10.260
And if you're, if you're dealing
with something like,

34:10.380 --> 34:12.800
let's say Element 115,
if that really exists,

34:12.929 --> 34:15.100
if you're dealing with some sort
of field propulsion,

34:15.219 --> 34:18.929
it's gonna have a little bit
of a halo around it.

34:19.060 --> 34:22.270
What Sam pointed out
is absolutely extraordinary.

34:22.400 --> 34:25.940
What I'm seeing is this bubble
around the craft,

34:26.070 --> 34:27.610
and I'm willing to call it
a craft now,

34:27.730 --> 34:29.900
because I don't think it's just
a drone anymore.

34:30.030 --> 34:31.739
I'm looking at something
that points to a really,

34:31.860 --> 34:34.120
really extraordinary
propulsion system.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.870
TAYLOR:
That right there is clearly
something there,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.330
if it's not a camera artifact.

34:40.460 --> 34:42.080
EDWARDS:
Well, the lights
definitely rotate

34:42.210 --> 34:43.830
-with the shape, right?
-TAYLOR: Yeah. Yeah.

34:43.960 --> 34:47.300
Which-which makes you think
it's not a camera artifact.

34:47.420 --> 34:52.380
If this were just an artifact
of the camera technology,

34:52.510 --> 34:55.719
I would have expected the halo

34:55.850 --> 34:57.640
to have looked slightly
different.

34:57.760 --> 35:00.810
The fact that there are strange
little striations

35:00.930 --> 35:03.310
from it that are turning
when the vehicle turns,

35:03.440 --> 35:05.730
it doesn't look like
it's a camera artifact.

35:07.820 --> 35:09.360
Sam, until I saw this,

35:09.480 --> 35:10.610
I had a completely different
opinion of this video.

35:10.740 --> 35:13.110
-Oh, nice.
-TAYLOR: Seeing the video

35:13.240 --> 35:15.370
and the analysis
that we did today with Sam,

35:15.490 --> 35:18.540
it's opened my mind
to accept that it's possible

35:18.660 --> 35:20.750
that this is a vehicle

35:20.870 --> 35:25.710
that might function a lot like
the stories that Bob Lazar told.

35:25.830 --> 35:28.090
This does have similarities
that are...

35:28.210 --> 35:29.800
uncanny.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.340
My skin is tingling from this.

35:40.020 --> 35:42.310
NARRATOR:
If the bubble of cold air
enveloping the craft

35:42.430 --> 35:45.480
in the GIMBAL video
is the same phenomenon

35:45.600 --> 35:47.860
exhibited by Bob Lazar's
"Sport Model,"

35:47.980 --> 35:50.940
could it be that the U.S.
military has mastered

35:51.070 --> 35:53.950
the Element 115
propulsion system?

35:54.070 --> 35:58.740
KNAPP:
It acts precisely how Bob Lazar
described the abilities

35:58.870 --> 36:00.450
of the "Sport Model."

36:00.580 --> 36:03.960
And by the way, I-I have spoken
to multiple Defense Department

36:04.080 --> 36:06.380
sources who are familiar
with the release of that video,

36:06.500 --> 36:10.050
and they believe that it's
because of special materials

36:10.170 --> 36:12.050
that that craft can do
what it did.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.010
What those special materials
are, I don't know,

36:14.130 --> 36:16.340
but it sure sounds like
Element 115 to me.

36:16.470 --> 36:19.510
But if the DoD is in possession

36:19.640 --> 36:21.640
of such extraordinary
technology,

36:21.770 --> 36:24.140
why is it being kept a secret?

36:24.270 --> 36:27.440
Could other world powers
have also recovered

36:27.560 --> 36:29.230
similar technology?

36:29.360 --> 36:32.900
And will the public ever know
the full truth?

36:33.030 --> 36:35.610
CHILDRESS:
In my mind, there is
a deep state,

36:35.740 --> 36:38.820
and that deep state
is essentially the military.

36:38.950 --> 36:40.410
And what makes that deep state

36:40.530 --> 36:44.330
ultimately is
the incredible technology

36:44.450 --> 36:46.500
that our military has.

36:46.620 --> 36:50.340
And in fact, I believe
it's quite possible

36:50.460 --> 36:54.590
that we're already
exploring Mars

36:54.720 --> 36:57.090
and perhaps other planets,

36:57.220 --> 37:01.430
and the military is keeping it
a secret from us.

37:01.560 --> 37:05.180
POPE: This... the possibility
that this is part

37:05.310 --> 37:07.770
of an acclimatization program,

37:07.890 --> 37:11.860
a sort of drip feeding
of the truth out to us.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.740
A declassified video here,

37:14.860 --> 37:16.530
a document there.

37:16.650 --> 37:19.410
And maybe Bob Lazar
fits into that story.

37:21.370 --> 37:23.740
NARRATOR:
With the Pentagon's release

37:23.870 --> 37:26.040
of top secret UFO videos,

37:26.160 --> 37:28.330
along with increased
scientific cooperation

37:28.460 --> 37:30.130
between world powers

37:30.250 --> 37:33.750
and the addition of Element 115
to the periodic table,

37:33.880 --> 37:36.050
is the public being
slowly prepared

37:36.170 --> 37:38.720
to enter an entirely
new reality?

37:38.840 --> 37:43.390
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

37:43.510 --> 37:45.890
and suggest that if
the U.S. government really is

37:46.020 --> 37:48.270
in possession
of alien technology,

37:48.390 --> 37:50.560
an even more important
question is,

37:50.690 --> 37:53.020
just where is it taking us?

37:59.950 --> 38:02.740
♪ ♪

38:02.870 --> 38:04.580
NARRATOR:
Dubna, Russia.

38:04.700 --> 38:08.160
December 26, 2018.

38:08.290 --> 38:10.870
An international team
of physicists

38:11.000 --> 38:12.920
at the Flerov Laboratory

38:13.040 --> 38:16.960
successfully fire the DC-280
cyclotron particle accelerator

38:17.090 --> 38:19.340
for the first time.

38:20.840 --> 38:24.720
Its beam is the most powerful
ever recorded

38:24.850 --> 38:27.560
among the world's top
nuclear facilities.

38:29.430 --> 38:31.850
The physicists will use
the new facility

38:31.980 --> 38:34.820
to work on stabilizing
superheavy metals

38:34.940 --> 38:37.440
like Element 115...

38:40.030 --> 38:42.030
...so that their incredible
energy potential

38:42.160 --> 38:44.070
can be harnessed.

38:45.330 --> 38:46.790
STONEHILL:
The Flerov Laboratory

38:46.910 --> 38:48.410
has been in the forefront

38:48.540 --> 38:51.330
of nuclear particle
physics research.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.880
And on January 29, 2019,

38:54.000 --> 38:57.750
TASS News Agency came out
with announcement

38:57.880 --> 39:00.720
that this year,
there'll be breakthroughs,

39:00.840 --> 39:04.220
because they will use many more
atoms than before

39:04.340 --> 39:07.470
when they discovered
Element 114 and 115.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.730
And definitely there is
much more effort that's going on

39:10.850 --> 39:12.940
in Dubna today
than we know about.

39:16.940 --> 39:20.650
POPE:
It's a center of excellence
when it comes to research

39:20.780 --> 39:23.530
into superheavy elements.

39:23.660 --> 39:27.330
And whenever you're dealing
with these superheavy elements,

39:27.450 --> 39:30.410
you are dealing with something
that has the capability

39:30.540 --> 39:33.120
to generate large amounts
of energy.

39:33.250 --> 39:35.040
(explosion)

39:35.170 --> 39:37.170
And again, this is what
Bob Lazar said

39:37.290 --> 39:39.500
was the ultimate secret of UFOs.

39:39.630 --> 39:41.420
So, how long will it be

39:41.550 --> 39:44.630
before we are out there
among the stars?

39:44.760 --> 39:46.470
And I think that's where
we go next.

39:48.010 --> 39:49.890
We're at an interesting time

39:50.020 --> 39:51.980
in the development
of our species.

39:52.100 --> 39:55.650
NARRATOR:
If the government has secretly
been attempting

39:55.770 --> 39:59.440
to reverse engineer a stabilized
version of Element 115

39:59.570 --> 40:01.690
recovered from an alien craft,

40:01.820 --> 40:06.320
will these new experiments
accelerate that effort?

40:06.450 --> 40:10.870
I think we've got technology,
bits and pieces,

40:10.990 --> 40:13.580
maybe an entire craft,
or more than one craft,

40:13.710 --> 40:15.080
from somewhere else.

40:15.210 --> 40:16.790
Stuff that we didn't make.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.210
The reality is,
if this technology exists,

40:19.340 --> 40:20.800
and if we could figure out

40:20.920 --> 40:22.460
how it works,
and if we can duplicate it,

40:22.590 --> 40:24.510
it has limitless potential.

40:24.630 --> 40:27.510
It would propel humanity
to a new level.

40:27.640 --> 40:31.600
CORBELL:
This technology would alter
the basic fabric

40:31.720 --> 40:34.020
of how we relate
to the external world.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.900
If you can produce a gravity
wave, you've won.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.270
That's it.

40:38.400 --> 40:42.030
The entire landscape
of your reality changes.

40:42.150 --> 40:46.820
It is a fearsome technology,
a powerful technology,

40:46.950 --> 40:50.580
and with great power
comes great responsibility.

40:50.700 --> 40:54.960
CHILDRESS:
The idea that extraterrestrials
are giving us technology,

40:55.080 --> 40:57.210
perhaps, is an exciting idea.

40:57.330 --> 41:00.500
But... we have to wonder
just what interactions

41:00.630 --> 41:03.090
we really are having
with extraterrestrials,

41:03.210 --> 41:05.590
and what they think of us.

41:05.720 --> 41:09.140
And I like to think
that the space programs

41:09.260 --> 41:11.760
of our own military, and of

41:11.890 --> 41:13.470
other countries as well,

41:13.600 --> 41:16.690
that we are going
to work together,

41:16.810 --> 41:19.560
that our own efforts
to go into space

41:19.690 --> 41:23.110
and other planets
are for peaceful purposes,

41:23.230 --> 41:25.320
and not for ones of conquering

41:25.440 --> 41:28.280
other civilizations
or taking

41:28.410 --> 41:29.740
other people's resources.

41:29.860 --> 41:31.570
And I think that
the extraterrestrials, too,

41:31.700 --> 41:33.080
are watching us

41:33.200 --> 41:34.910
for those very reasons.

41:35.040 --> 41:37.790
NARRATOR: Are we on the verge
of harnessing

41:37.910 --> 41:40.290
the awesome power
of Element 115

41:40.420 --> 41:45.460
and embarking on a journey
unlike humanity has ever seen?

41:45.590 --> 41:48.510
Perhaps as we reach
this critical next step

41:48.630 --> 41:50.430
in human evolution,

41:50.550 --> 41:53.220
we will finally
know the full truth

41:53.350 --> 41:56.890
about both our history
and our origins...

41:57.020 --> 42:00.440
and begin the next chapter
of mankind...

42:00.560 --> 42:03.610
in the cosmos.
