00:27.637 --> 00:30.057
Get down, get down!

00:31.817 --> 00:33.146
There he is!

00:33.147 --> 00:34.967
Get that son of a bitch!

00:54.297 --> 00:57.367
My job was to
keep people alive.

01:00.577 --> 01:02.947
But right now,
I have a different job.

01:23.927 --> 01:25.986
Protecting people wasn't easy...

01:25.987 --> 01:27.647
but it was simple.

01:29.167 --> 01:30.536
Don't drink.

01:30.537 --> 01:32.127
Stay sharp.

01:33.237 --> 01:35.887
And be prepared to take
a bullet from your client.

01:42.347 --> 01:44.707
This is the story of a dead man.

02:00.497 --> 02:02.636
When did you get back?

02:02.637 --> 02:05.177
Couple of weeks ago.

02:20.257 --> 02:22.307
So this is where
you've been living.

02:22.387 --> 02:24.157
It's not the Biltmore, I know.

02:25.587 --> 02:28.097
No, it's definitely
not the Biltmore.

02:29.877 --> 02:31.357
Want to sit down?

02:31.427 --> 02:32.746
Yeah, yeah.

02:32.747 --> 02:34.997
- Coat?
- Oh, thank you.

02:39.237 --> 02:41.687
So, um, you want a drink?

02:42.107 --> 02:43.826
That would be great.

02:43.827 --> 02:45.607
It's your favorite.

02:50.117 --> 02:52.177
So, where've you been?

02:54.517 --> 02:56.197
I had some thinking to do.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.296
Look, you're the only one
left I can trust.

03:00.297 --> 03:01.676
I need your help.

03:01.677 --> 03:03.937
Sure, yeah, anything.

03:04.467 --> 03:06.127
You're not gonna have any?

03:06.397 --> 03:08.347
I don't drink, remember?

03:09.917 --> 03:11.967
This is why I brought you here.

03:16.977 --> 03:18.717
Oh, my God.

03:24.857 --> 03:26.497
Whoever put your
boyfriend in jail

03:26.498 --> 03:29.047
and killed his father
is on this wall.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.486
I just can't make sense of it.

03:31.487 --> 03:32.636
Not yet.

03:32.637 --> 03:34.116
I can't believe this.

03:34.117 --> 03:36.536
You can help me
fill in the blanks.

03:36.537 --> 03:38.276
Let's take a look at the family.

03:38.277 --> 03:40.316
Two patriarchs who join forces:

03:40.317 --> 03:43.517
Serg, the politician to
care public affairs;

03:43.537 --> 03:45.316
Hayden, the businessman.

03:45.317 --> 03:46.846
They had their differences,

03:46.847 --> 03:48.977
but they respected each other.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.216
Man: Sergio, you taught me

03:51.217 --> 03:53.177
the most important
lessons in life...

03:54.177 --> 03:58.366
honor, respect,
a man's word is his bond.

03:58.367 --> 04:00.736
And on top of all that...

04:00.737 --> 04:02.977
he made me his partner.

04:03.357 --> 04:05.386
- So please, lift your glasses.
- Salud!

04:05.387 --> 04:09.047
To my friend,
my partner, my family.

04:09.507 --> 04:11.506
- To Sergio!
- Salud!

04:11.507 --> 04:13.087
God bless.

04:13.567 --> 04:16.457
I consider myself
a very lucky man.

04:17.466 --> 04:21.065
Senator Roswald, it is an honor
and a pleasure to have you here.

04:21.067 --> 04:24.767
Together, we have built
what I am proud to call...

04:25.207 --> 04:26.747
a small empire.

04:29.517 --> 04:31.217
Still...

04:32.247 --> 04:35.647
my most endearing
and gratifying achievements

04:36.987 --> 04:38.717
are my two boys.

04:39.557 --> 04:41.546
Although, like his late mother,

04:41.547 --> 04:43.727
may she rest in peace...

04:44.327 --> 04:46.297
my youngest boy is late.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.487
Fellas.

04:51.527 --> 04:53.007
How's it going?

04:53.337 --> 04:54.966
- Hey, big guy.
- Hey.

04:54.967 --> 04:56.375
What are you doing out here?

04:56.376 --> 04:57.877
A little extra
security doesn't hurt.

04:57.878 --> 04:59.736
Well, enjoy the cold, huh?

04:59.737 --> 05:01.637
I got something for you, Kurt.

05:02.477 --> 05:03.816
Is it my birthday?

05:03.817 --> 05:06.067
- What's going on?
- Take a look.

05:09.747 --> 05:11.277
My mother.

05:15.527 --> 05:17.386
I've never seen this before.

05:17.387 --> 05:20.197
She gave it to me
before she got sick.

05:22.067 --> 05:24.177
I want you to have it.

05:27.037 --> 05:29.386
You may be
our head of security,

05:29.387 --> 05:30.927
but I've always thought
of you as a brother.

05:30.928 --> 05:32.436
You know that, right?

05:32.437 --> 05:35.087
My six-foot-five
blonde brother.

05:35.547 --> 05:37.007
Always will.

05:42.647 --> 05:43.676
Thanks.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.017
- Have fun in there.
- I will.

05:45.018 --> 05:47.397
- Don't drink too much.
- Not too much.

05:50.057 --> 05:51.357
- Ahh, there he is!
- Pop!

05:51.427 --> 05:52.957
Hey, hey, hey, my boy!

05:53.027 --> 05:54.897
- How are you?
- I'm glad you could make it.

05:55.277 --> 05:55.967
I'm sorry.

05:55.968 --> 05:58.636
- Did I miss your toast?
- Ah, you didn't miss anything.

05:58.637 --> 06:00.007
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you.

06:00.008 --> 06:02.377
You missed the toast but
you brought the butter.

06:03.577 --> 06:07.087
That all changed the day
of Sergio's 70th birthday.

06:07.377 --> 06:09.467
Hmm, Senator Roswald.

06:10.217 --> 06:13.436
Well, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

06:13.437 --> 06:15.716
especially on your birthday.

06:15.717 --> 06:17.216
You said you had
something urgent

06:17.217 --> 06:19.116
you wanted to discuss.

06:19.117 --> 06:22.647
We're gonna have to
rethink our operation.

06:22.897 --> 06:24.746
What do you mean "rethink"?

06:24.747 --> 06:27.906
There's a new man
working on the bureau.

06:27.907 --> 06:30.027
He can't be bought.

06:30.407 --> 06:33.057
So if I can't protect you,

06:33.577 --> 06:36.377
then you're
going to have to stop.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.637
I'll have to get back to you.

06:40.277 --> 06:42.797
There's nothing to get back to.

06:46.347 --> 06:47.817
You do as I say.

06:54.357 --> 06:56.097
I was always around.

06:56.497 --> 06:58.977
Watchful eyes and ears.

06:59.497 --> 07:01.477
You hear things.

07:03.437 --> 07:06.937
The senator wasn't the only
one to bring bad news.

07:12.877 --> 07:15.247
Serg... I, uh...

07:16.177 --> 07:17.566
I've got a nephew.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.326
His name is Campbell.

07:19.327 --> 07:22.476
He's my... my,
uh, oldest sister's boy,

07:22.477 --> 07:24.357
God rest her soul.

07:24.527 --> 07:28.077
Anyway, he got into a spot
of trouble in Liverpool.

07:28.867 --> 07:30.447
I'd like to bring
him to the States,

07:30.448 --> 07:33.896
and, uh, you know, put him
under our wing.

07:33.897 --> 07:35.376
Give him a job.

07:35.377 --> 07:37.416
Get into the business.

07:37.417 --> 07:39.806
Is that all right with you?

07:39.807 --> 07:41.197
Sure.

07:42.007 --> 07:43.137
Thanks.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.697
Come here!

07:55.287 --> 07:57.287
Have you got a speech
impediment, huh?

07:58.987 --> 08:00.557
See, I never heard it
when you was

08:00.558 --> 08:02.457
chatting up my girlfriend.

08:06.727 --> 08:07.636
Ha-ha.

08:07.637 --> 08:09.186
Now we're getting serious.

08:09.187 --> 08:10.667
Come on!

08:11.437 --> 08:12.725
Leave me alone!

08:12.726 --> 08:14.147
I don't want any trouble!

08:14.148 --> 08:15.776
Neither do I.

08:15.777 --> 08:17.807
That's why I'm gonna
have to kill you.

08:32.157 --> 08:34.677
I'm going to have to take this.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.327
Yeah?

08:44.307 --> 08:46.017
Yeah, I'll be there.

08:51.577 --> 08:53.296
We're all concerned.

08:53.297 --> 08:55.357
We need to shut down
the operation.

08:57.917 --> 08:59.017
You've been drinking.

08:59.018 --> 09:01.566
There's been a major
change at the bureau.

09:01.567 --> 09:04.027
We'll be losing our protection.

09:05.527 --> 09:07.016
What about Hayden?

09:07.017 --> 09:09.467
He'll have to accept my decision.

09:09.997 --> 09:11.645
We're all a part
of the same family.

09:11.646 --> 09:12.857
He's not my family.

09:12.858 --> 09:14.557
You know what I mean.

09:14.867 --> 09:17.446
This isn't the time to
talk about this, Dad.

09:17.447 --> 09:18.846
It's the perfect time.

09:18.847 --> 09:22.397
It's times like now that
we see what really matters.

09:23.477 --> 09:25.757
You and your brother's happiness.

09:26.177 --> 09:28.627
That's all I really care about.

09:29.377 --> 09:30.666
End it now.

09:30.667 --> 09:34.507
Get out with Loryn...
while you still can.

09:36.047 --> 09:37.947
Too many moving parts.

09:39.327 --> 09:40.817
This won't end well.

09:44.357 --> 09:46.477
You let me worry about that.

09:48.567 --> 09:52.457
After that party, I never
saw the family happy again.

09:53.167 --> 09:56.217
You got yourself
a real princess here.

09:56.307 --> 09:58.626
- Men have killed for less.
- You?

09:58.627 --> 10:00.177
You wouldn't hurt a fly.

10:00.197 --> 10:01.716
You wanna see some real action?

10:01.717 --> 10:03.575
Come and see me box
tomorrow night.

10:03.576 --> 10:04.927
What are you talking about?

10:04.928 --> 10:06.726
He thinks he's
Oscar De La Hoya.

10:06.727 --> 10:08.546
It means a lot to me.

10:08.547 --> 10:11.157
You know I don't like violence.

10:11.587 --> 10:13.156
But we'll do what we can.

10:13.157 --> 10:14.896
See what I've gotta
put up with?

10:14.897 --> 10:16.797
You gotta put up with it?

10:16.997 --> 10:18.776
Am I annoying you?

10:18.777 --> 10:20.696
Okay, okay, awkward moment.

10:20.697 --> 10:22.497
I take the hint.

10:27.067 --> 10:28.947
What's wrong?

10:30.847 --> 10:32.377
My father...

10:32.827 --> 10:35.147
wants to end all of it.

10:36.377 --> 10:38.177
What do you want?

10:46.987 --> 10:48.877
How you doing, Uncle?

10:48.917 --> 10:50.046
Oh, boy.

10:50.047 --> 10:51.766
- Long time, no see.
- Oh, gosh.

10:51.767 --> 10:53.627
- Yeah, you look terrific.
- Thanks.

10:53.628 --> 10:54.896
Cheers.

10:54.897 --> 10:56.996
- A little jammed up, eh?
- Yeah.

10:56.997 --> 10:58.356
All right.

10:58.357 --> 10:59.866
Look, I spoke to Sergio.

10:59.867 --> 11:02.007
You're gonna work with Quinn.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.367
But you gotta promise me.

11:03.368 --> 11:04.956
I want you to be low-key.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.296
Respectful.

11:06.297 --> 11:08.736
I want them to trust you.

11:08.737 --> 11:10.096
- Okay?
- Yeah.

11:10.097 --> 11:11.225
This is not London.

11:11.226 --> 11:12.517
This is the States now.

11:12.518 --> 11:14.157
Rules are different.

11:17.917 --> 11:20.916
It wasn't my place to
advise the family.

11:20.917 --> 11:23.556
My job was to make sure
they got from "A" to "B"

11:23.557 --> 11:25.557
in one piece.

11:27.997 --> 11:30.147
But letting a thug like Campbell
into the business

11:30.148 --> 11:32.247
was too much of a risk.

11:33.307 --> 11:36.357
And my job is all about
risk assessment.

11:44.447 --> 11:47.466
A guy like Campbell was never
gonna be satisfied

11:47.467 --> 11:50.217
chauffeuring us
around for very long.

11:54.097 --> 11:55.937
Quinn must have known that.

12:01.337 --> 12:04.646
The family's main source
of revenue was illegal gambling

12:04.647 --> 12:06.607
and identity theft.

12:08.877 --> 12:12.447
But Quinn had finally talked
his old man into branching out.

12:18.417 --> 12:20.517
To the printing business.

12:30.197 --> 12:33.357
If it all worked out,
they were gonna make millions.

12:37.917 --> 12:40.267
It's hard just to
walk away from that.

12:54.087 --> 12:56.086
Let's add Boris
to the equation.

12:56.087 --> 12:57.707
He's the one who set up
the delivery

12:57.708 --> 12:59.587
at the warehouse.

13:01.847 --> 13:05.066
Printing the money
is only half the job.

13:05.067 --> 13:07.066
You need someone to circulate the bills

13:07.067 --> 13:09.347
into the open market.

13:10.467 --> 13:12.217
Someone like Boris.

13:15.407 --> 13:17.237
Someone like Boris.

13:21.077 --> 13:23.257
This is the kind of meeting where
things can suddenly

13:23.258 --> 13:25.807
take a turn for the worse.

13:26.777 --> 13:27.977
Quinn.

13:28.587 --> 13:29.947
It's good to see you again.

13:29.948 --> 13:32.127
Always a pleasure, Boris.

13:34.927 --> 13:36.757
How's your father?

13:37.187 --> 13:38.836
He's retiring.

13:38.837 --> 13:41.066
We lost our protection and...

13:41.067 --> 13:42.517
he doesn't want
the family engaged

13:42.518 --> 13:44.727
in illegal activity any longer.

13:46.267 --> 13:47.877
What about you?

14:05.287 --> 14:07.137
Excellent work.

14:08.127 --> 14:11.206
What did I do to deserve
such a gift from Sergio?

14:11.207 --> 14:15.266
Well, your operation
is light and efficient,

14:15.267 --> 14:16.616
he trusts you.

14:16.617 --> 14:18.757
So I'm the sacrificial lamb.

14:18.967 --> 14:20.156
Oh, no.

14:20.157 --> 14:21.656
You're the wolf, Boris.

14:21.657 --> 14:23.597
Everyone knows that.

14:25.247 --> 14:27.436
- How much?
- 30%.

14:27.437 --> 14:29.736
You mean I take all the risks,

14:29.737 --> 14:31.376
and you get 30%?

14:31.377 --> 14:32.807
Naturally.

14:33.757 --> 14:35.966
Tell your father I'm flattered.

14:35.967 --> 14:37.656
But there is one element

14:37.657 --> 14:39.256
he hasn't taken consideration.

14:39.257 --> 14:40.247
What's that?

14:40.248 --> 14:42.026
There is no one else in town

14:42.027 --> 14:44.146
who can pull off
a scheme like this.

14:44.147 --> 14:47.427
No one else he can fully trust.

14:48.437 --> 14:50.157
I will accept at ten.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.547
And to prove to him my honesty,

14:53.807 --> 14:56.237
I will take my payment

14:56.607 --> 14:58.256
once we reach agreement.

14:58.257 --> 14:59.286
You see that?

14:59.287 --> 15:01.577
- I love your style.
- So do I.

15:05.317 --> 15:07.596
Oh, Quinn, one more thing.

15:07.597 --> 15:11.097
Mr. Huang needs another delivery.

15:17.987 --> 15:19.987
Let's go, boys.

15:32.397 --> 15:34.576
Can you spare some change, man?

15:34.577 --> 15:36.727
Hey, man, can you spare
some change?

15:41.697 --> 15:43.247
Something was wrong.

15:43.587 --> 15:45.796
This was no bum,
he was too clean.

15:45.797 --> 15:47.577
And he was not alone.

15:48.367 --> 15:49.537
Thank you, bro.

16:16.557 --> 16:18.767
These guys were professionals.

16:19.557 --> 16:21.477
It takes one to know one.

16:33.007 --> 16:34.717
Get in, go, go.

16:41.377 --> 16:42.777
Are you okay?

16:43.077 --> 16:45.527
Yeah, sure,
if you like concussions.

16:46.947 --> 16:48.155
You don't think it was Boris?

16:48.156 --> 16:50.117
Not a chance,
he's not smart enough.

16:50.118 --> 16:51.506
Who, if not Boris?

16:51.507 --> 16:53.347
Well, the list of enemies
is pretty long.

16:53.348 --> 16:55.576
But no one would have
the guts to try that.

16:55.577 --> 16:57.247
No one would dare.

16:57.927 --> 16:59.857
- You want my opinion?
- No.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.496
Yeah, sure.

17:01.497 --> 17:04.346
- They'd rather frame Boris than hurt you.
- Why?

17:04.347 --> 17:07.077
They want us to think Boris
is behind the attack.

17:09.207 --> 17:10.627
I'm impressed, Campbell.

17:11.307 --> 17:13.237
No, it makes sense, but who?

17:18.847 --> 17:23.267
Boris, Hayden, Campbell,
Senator Roswald.

17:24.227 --> 17:27.126
Okay, so we have
the list of our suspects.

17:27.127 --> 17:28.987
Anyone else?

17:29.057 --> 17:30.297
Kurt.

17:30.497 --> 17:31.777
Kurt?

17:32.467 --> 17:34.277
He does have a dark side.

17:41.377 --> 17:44.346
You know, for a big brother,
you're such a dumb-ass.

17:44.347 --> 17:46.267
- Where's Pop?
- Ln the den.

17:48.347 --> 17:50.026
Now that I've got you here,

17:50.027 --> 17:51.415
there is something I did
want to tell you.

17:51.416 --> 17:52.547
- Me, too.
- What?

17:52.548 --> 17:54.146
You hit like a girl.

17:54.147 --> 17:55.986
There you go.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.506
So, your kid brother

17:57.507 --> 17:59.646
just got accepted
into the bureau.

17:59.647 --> 18:00.876
You what?

18:00.877 --> 18:03.106
- I got into the FBI.
- Shut the fuck up!

18:03.107 --> 18:05.046
I didn't even know you applied.

18:05.047 --> 18:06.617
So what?

18:07.067 --> 18:10.036
Do I get big brother's
approval here, or...

18:10.037 --> 18:11.976
- Yeah, you do.
- Yeah?

18:11.977 --> 18:13.757
Come here, I'm proud of you.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.457
- I'm really proud of you.
- Thanks.

18:20.247 --> 18:21.757
No dancing.

18:22.867 --> 18:25.617
Hey, it means a lot to me.

18:26.087 --> 18:27.437
I'm serious.

18:34.957 --> 18:36.187
Pop.

18:37.397 --> 18:38.617
Pop.

18:39.067 --> 18:40.817
What's going on, son?

18:41.397 --> 18:43.507
Kurt got into the FBI.

18:43.937 --> 18:45.307
I know.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.737
I'm proud of him.

18:47.757 --> 18:49.506
I'm sure you are, but...

18:49.507 --> 18:51.306
Come on, the FBI?

18:51.307 --> 18:52.377
I promised your mother

18:52.378 --> 18:54.466
- I'd keep him out of our business.
- I know.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.657
- I intend to keep that promise.
- I know.

18:59.387 --> 19:01.257
Boris wants ten.

19:01.787 --> 19:03.907
I think I can get 20.

19:04.257 --> 19:05.947
Good.

19:08.027 --> 19:09.847
There's more than that.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.737
Hayden knows.

19:13.397 --> 19:15.137
I don't think he's happy.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.597
He will be.

19:17.807 --> 19:19.957
I'll leave him a good share.

19:20.537 --> 19:23.246
Make him an offer
he can't refuse.

19:23.247 --> 19:25.086
It's more than he deserves.

19:25.087 --> 19:27.146
I don't think it's about money.

19:27.147 --> 19:29.457
It's always about the money.

19:32.887 --> 19:34.687
I got a delivery to
make to Huang.

19:34.688 --> 19:36.407
Don't do it, son.

19:40.087 --> 19:42.797
- It's too late, Pop.
- It's never too late.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.977
Times are changing faster
than you can say "jail."

19:50.897 --> 19:52.397
Love ya.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.557
Quinn!

19:56.897 --> 19:59.587
Quinn made the decision
to leave me behind.

20:02.927 --> 20:06.197
The Chinese were the biggest buyers
of stolen IDs.

20:07.347 --> 20:09.717
The gang was
run by Mr. Huang.

20:11.087 --> 20:14.547
Except that was not
Mr. Huang.

20:38.047 --> 20:40.477
Good evening...
Mr. Quinn.

20:43.487 --> 20:45.677
I was expecting
Mr. Huang.

20:45.957 --> 20:47.856
He's not feeling well tonight.

20:47.857 --> 20:49.106
Really?

20:49.107 --> 20:50.947
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:51.227 --> 20:53.676
Yo, I thought we said alone?

20:53.677 --> 20:55.277
Yeah, we did.

20:55.967 --> 20:57.825
I know that identity theft
is a growth industry,

20:57.826 --> 20:58.815
but this is ridiculous.

20:58.816 --> 21:00.167
How many guys we got here?

21:00.168 --> 21:01.686
What are they,
go-go dancers?

21:01.687 --> 21:04.637
- Who's that?
- That's my driver.

21:09.177 --> 21:10.876
See, I was expecting Huang.

21:10.877 --> 21:12.717
I was expecting Huang!

21:14.047 --> 21:15.707
Well, you got me.

21:15.787 --> 21:17.146
Right...

21:17.147 --> 21:18.397
You got it?

21:18.457 --> 21:20.077
Yeah, I got it.

21:21.757 --> 21:23.777
Relax, will ya?

21:27.837 --> 21:29.157
There.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.317
Now, about my money.

21:39.147 --> 21:40.366
You got it.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.706
It should have arrived.

21:41.707 --> 21:43.946
Yeah, you see that's...

21:43.947 --> 21:45.647
I don't see it.

21:47.147 --> 21:48.396
It's done.

21:48.397 --> 21:50.456
It's... no, it's not...
it's not done.

21:50.457 --> 21:53.586
I don't...
I don't see anything there.

21:53.587 --> 21:55.287
It's a matter of seconds.

21:55.997 --> 21:58.217
Yeah, it's, um...

21:58.687 --> 22:01.066
- Well, check again.
- Yeah, I can do that.

22:01.067 --> 22:02.946
You know, could be the signal,

22:02.947 --> 22:05.336
like we could be in a bad area.

22:05.337 --> 22:06.927
Any second.

22:07.407 --> 22:08.397
Saw!

22:09.877 --> 22:10.977
Oh, shit!

22:29.557 --> 22:31.027
Go, Quinn, I've gotcha!

22:40.607 --> 22:42.327
I got you, go!

22:59.627 --> 23:01.986
- You order a BLT?
- No time.

23:01.987 --> 23:03.887
Let's go back,
I'll call for help.

23:03.888 --> 23:06.216
I want Grimaldi alive.
Yes, ma'am.

23:06.217 --> 23:07.727
I'll call Hayden.

23:07.997 --> 23:09.856
Hunter, go left, Sanchez, right.

23:09.857 --> 23:11.626
Watch your crossfire.

23:11.627 --> 23:13.186
Uncle, it's Campbell.

23:13.187 --> 23:14.887
We're in trouble!

23:15.797 --> 23:18.426
I told him to leave with you.

23:18.427 --> 23:19.936
Excuse me?

23:19.937 --> 23:21.337
Quinn.

23:22.077 --> 23:24.807
I told him to
quit the business...

23:25.187 --> 23:27.926
and live a normal life
with you.

23:27.927 --> 23:29.497
Start a family.

23:36.627 --> 23:38.046
Excuse me.

23:38.047 --> 23:39.307
Hayden.

23:39.627 --> 23:40.977
What?

23:41.687 --> 23:43.426
How do you know?

23:43.427 --> 23:46.057
Because my nephew's
in there as well.

23:48.967 --> 23:51.006
I was about to retire.

23:51.007 --> 23:52.276
I know that.

23:52.277 --> 23:53.717
<i>I was about to close a deal</i>

23:53.718 --> 23:55.756
that would make us
as rich as Croesus.

23:55.757 --> 23:58.156
Money can buy retirement, Serg.

23:58.157 --> 23:59.556
But not peace of mind.

23:59.557 --> 24:01.256
And look where we are now.

24:01.257 --> 24:03.376
I'm about to lose a son
and you a nephew.

24:03.377 --> 24:05.896
Look, I've got
a plan to get them out.

24:05.897 --> 24:07.496
I'll need Axel.

24:07.497 --> 24:09.276
<i>You get me Axel, Serg.</i>

24:09.277 --> 24:10.956
Consider it done.

24:10.957 --> 24:12.386
Good.

24:12.387 --> 24:13.865
<i>That's good, Serg.</i>

24:13.866 --> 24:15.687
<i>I'll give him all
the details at the office.</i>

24:15.688 --> 24:17.017
Fine.

24:18.537 --> 24:19.987
Axel.

24:22.677 --> 24:24.907
Meet Hayden at the office.

24:25.277 --> 24:26.737
But Quinn told me
to stay with you, sir.

24:26.738 --> 24:28.236
He was set up, framed.

24:28.237 --> 24:29.837
If you don't get
him out of there,

24:29.838 --> 24:31.287
they'll arrest him.

24:34.297 --> 24:35.517
I'll get him out.

24:36.727 --> 24:40.207
It didn't make sense for me
to meet Hayden at the office.

24:40.247 --> 24:42.506
He could've just given me
Quinn's location.

24:42.507 --> 24:44.917
Take me to 15th and 7th, now.

24:46.827 --> 24:48.937
But I didn't question orders.

25:06.517 --> 25:08.177
Freeze, drop your weapon.

25:08.587 --> 25:10.817
- Come on!
- Go, I'll take the heat for this.

25:10.847 --> 25:12.395
- Are you sure?
- Tell my dad I'm sorry, all right.

25:12.396 --> 25:13.675
- Tell my dad he was right.
- Freeze!

25:13.676 --> 25:15.047
Come on now...
I'm unarmed!

25:15.048 --> 25:16.867
I've got nothing!

25:18.327 --> 25:20.667
Quinn Grimaldi,
you're under arrest.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.847
How did he get through?

25:27.067 --> 25:30.307
How did Campbell get past
the police once he got out?

25:39.347 --> 25:40.946
Don't worry about Quinn.

25:40.947 --> 25:43.707
I'm sure Axel will bring
him back safe and sound.

25:44.437 --> 25:45.777
Yeah.

25:46.587 --> 25:49.127
I'm gonna go outside
and grab myself a smoke.

25:50.257 --> 25:53.047
Your confidence in me was
misplaced that night.

25:54.347 --> 25:55.817
By the time Quinn got arrested,

25:55.818 --> 25:58.287
I wasn't even halfway
across town.

26:03.007 --> 26:05.197
I had never failed Sergio.

26:05.807 --> 26:08.006
I'm sure he had every expectation

26:08.007 --> 26:09.847
his son was coming home.

26:16.917 --> 26:18.147
Sergio.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.246
You don't have to kill her.

26:27.247 --> 26:29.247
It's me you want.

26:35.107 --> 26:36.387
Dad?

27:12.947 --> 27:13.937
Dad!

27:14.147 --> 27:16.647
Dad, Dad...
are you okay?

27:17.657 --> 27:19.156
You okay?

27:19.157 --> 27:20.166
Yeah.

27:20.167 --> 27:21.947
Kurt...

27:33.947 --> 27:35.506
When I got to the warehouse,

27:35.507 --> 27:37.777
Quinn was already at
central booking

27:38.067 --> 27:39.997
and there was
a warrant out for my arrest.

27:47.977 --> 27:50.567
It was the end of
the Grimaldi empire.

27:51.117 --> 27:53.097
After that, everything changed.

27:55.677 --> 27:59.337
Hayden and Campbell took over the
counterfeiting operation.

28:00.557 --> 28:03.627
I guess they found a permanent
partner in Boris.

28:04.817 --> 28:08.777
They're still protected from
the law by Senator Roswald.

28:09.337 --> 28:11.066
But worst of all,

28:11.067 --> 28:14.417
Campbell took up residence
in the Grimaldi family home.

28:15.207 --> 28:16.706
From there...

28:16.707 --> 28:19.047
he's got an iron grip
on the city.

28:21.307 --> 28:22.647
So that's why you left town.

28:22.648 --> 28:25.357
I mean, you had
the police coming after you.

28:26.417 --> 28:29.177
No, I just needed
time to be alone.

28:29.857 --> 28:31.677
What are you talking about?

28:32.687 --> 28:35.576
My job was to protect
Serg and Quinn.

28:35.577 --> 28:37.786
Now one's dead,
the other one's in jail.

28:37.787 --> 28:40.937
I owe it to him to find out
who's behind all this.

28:43.337 --> 28:45.666
So you came back for revenge.

28:45.667 --> 28:46.977
No.

28:47.467 --> 28:49.126
Yes, maybe.

28:49.127 --> 28:51.747
I just want to
set things straight.

28:56.347 --> 28:57.557
So...

28:58.017 --> 29:00.546
Quinn gets out of jail
at the end of the week.

29:00.547 --> 29:02.747
Think you're gonna be there?

29:04.927 --> 29:06.787
I don't think
he'll wanna see me.

29:09.357 --> 29:10.847
You know...

29:13.867 --> 29:15.647
it's not your fault.

29:16.567 --> 29:17.947
Yeah.

29:19.367 --> 29:20.997
Yeah, I know.

29:26.177 --> 29:27.506
I gotta go, 'kay?

29:27.507 --> 29:29.107
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:31.447 --> 29:33.937
I know more than
she can possibly imagine.

29:35.117 --> 29:38.017
I know where she's been
going for the last few months.

29:41.257 --> 29:43.497
Let's see if she comes clean.

29:54.407 --> 29:56.717
Yeah, it's Boris Moljevic.

29:58.107 --> 30:00.876
<i>We're coming right over,
we'll be there in ten.</i>

30:00.877 --> 30:03.986
<i>Grimaldi, whatever
you do, don't go in alone.</i>

30:03.987 --> 30:05.727
<i>Wait for back...</i>

30:46.287 --> 30:47.747
Demetri...

30:48.357 --> 30:49.486
FBI!

30:49.487 --> 30:52.496
Put your hands up,
guns down now!

30:52.497 --> 30:54.666
Privet, motherfucker,
I said now!

30:54.667 --> 30:56.487
Put it down!

30:56.947 --> 30:59.146
Who do we have here?

30:59.147 --> 31:00.767
Boris?

31:03.977 --> 31:07.557
Agent Kurt Grimaldi, welcome.

31:12.087 --> 31:14.596
Your father must have died
of a heart attack

31:14.597 --> 31:17.807
when you told him you
wanted to join the FBI.

31:21.157 --> 31:22.436
Is this it?

31:22.437 --> 31:24.056
Is this all you got?

31:24.057 --> 31:26.457
Five of your guys against one?

31:26.767 --> 31:29.386
The odds don't look that
good for you, Boris.

31:29.387 --> 31:30.667
Five.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.107
Not enough, Boris.

31:42.247 --> 31:43.397
Go, go, go.

31:44.017 --> 31:46.026
Take cover, take cover!

31:46.027 --> 31:47.497
Is the perimeter secured?

31:47.498 --> 31:49.496
The rear in the west side isn't.

31:49.497 --> 31:51.447
- Where's Agent Grimaldi?
- Inside.

32:12.247 --> 32:14.747
Come on, come on!

32:51.417 --> 32:53.237
Grab my hand!

33:01.907 --> 33:04.656
There's no room for
gunslingers in the bureau.

33:04.657 --> 33:06.676
Next time, wait for backup.

33:06.677 --> 33:08.696
I can ID Moljevic.

33:08.697 --> 33:10.296
He shot at me.

33:10.297 --> 33:12.217
We'll drag him in,
he'll post bail,

33:12.218 --> 33:13.686
be out by tonight.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.116
I don't want him, I want Campbell.

33:16.117 --> 33:17.896
And I know you do as well.

33:17.897 --> 33:20.057
But this obsession with
finding your father's killer

33:20.058 --> 33:22.747
is compromising your judgment.

33:23.117 --> 33:25.457
Now get the hell out of my sight.

33:45.937 --> 33:49.586
Had to put four of Mr. Huang's guys
in the hospital...

33:49.587 --> 33:52.817
but I finally tracked down
the man who set up Quinn.

34:01.877 --> 34:04.017
Now I'm gonna make him tell me
who hired him.

34:09.226 --> 34:12.286
Rumor has it,
Campbell owns this club.

34:13.297 --> 34:15.177
High-class prostitution.

34:20.206 --> 34:22.637
Sergio would have
never done this.

34:28.377 --> 34:29.966
Two bodyguards.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.757
Word must have gotten out
I'm looking for him.

34:33.746 --> 34:35.217
Should have hired better guys.

34:38.387 --> 34:39.937
That's gonna cost him.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.397
Who the fuck are you?

34:58.337 --> 35:00.476
Um, p...
please don't kill me.

35:00.477 --> 35:02.737
Why'd you set up
Quinn Grimaldi?

35:03.767 --> 35:05.176
I was paid to do it.

35:05.177 --> 35:07.307
- By who?
- I don't know.

35:07.987 --> 35:10.116
We spoke over the phone!

35:10.117 --> 35:11.846
You got a contact?

35:11.847 --> 35:13.426
- I don't.
- Give me your phone.

35:13.427 --> 35:15.226
Your phone, hurry up, Chopsticks.

35:15.227 --> 35:16.557
Come on.

35:26.097 --> 35:28.407
Why the fuck did you kill him?

35:33.987 --> 35:35.516
Kill the son of a bitch!

35:35.517 --> 35:37.377
- I'm sorry, okay!
- Hyah!

35:39.547 --> 35:40.897
Hyah!

35:44.987 --> 35:46.297
Hyah!

35:59.777 --> 36:01.657
Kick his fucking ass!

36:22.477 --> 36:23.927
Told you I was sorry.

36:25.897 --> 36:27.977
- Good kicks, though.
- Kiss my ass!

36:29.757 --> 36:31.527
Maybe next time.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.366
So, you wanna know about Kurt.

36:42.367 --> 36:45.017
Does he know about
the real family business?

36:45.547 --> 36:47.617
I think he knows.

36:48.117 --> 36:50.027
I think he always knew.

36:52.027 --> 36:53.377
Really?

36:53.927 --> 36:57.256
Well, he always knew what
Sergio and Quinn were up to.

36:57.257 --> 37:00.456
I mean, I can't prove it, but...

37:00.457 --> 37:03.347
Why do you think he
chose the FBI?

37:04.757 --> 37:07.247
- Revenge.
- Revenge?

37:09.037 --> 37:11.047
Being left aside.

37:19.087 --> 37:20.287
Senator.

37:20.587 --> 37:22.047
Hello, Kurt.

37:23.237 --> 37:25.456
Haven't seen you
in a long time.

37:25.457 --> 37:27.237
How ya been?

37:27.887 --> 37:30.017
What do you need, Senator?

37:32.097 --> 37:35.236
I was very close
to your father.

37:35.237 --> 37:37.667
I loved him like a brother.

37:38.597 --> 37:40.457
You didn't have any problem
getting into business

37:40.458 --> 37:41.957
with Hayden
and Campbell though.

37:41.958 --> 37:43.386
Sometimes...

37:43.387 --> 37:46.096
things don't turn out
the way that you plan them.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.096
Four years ago,
I came to your father.

37:48.097 --> 37:50.057
I begged Serg to
get out of the business

37:50.058 --> 37:51.797
and he agreed.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.966
That signed
the beginning of the end.

37:54.967 --> 37:57.817
Then this Campbell
comes aboard.

37:58.247 --> 37:59.737
He's more violent than ever.

37:59.738 --> 38:01.316
He starts a war.

38:01.317 --> 38:03.736
Kills all his opponents...

38:03.737 --> 38:05.576
or covers them with gifts.

38:05.577 --> 38:07.747
Well, I suppose that makes
you one of the second types

38:07.748 --> 38:09.056
of people then, Senator.

38:09.057 --> 38:12.226
I just can't provide
the protection for them

38:12.227 --> 38:14.276
that they need anymore.

38:14.277 --> 38:16.067
I'm useless.

38:16.407 --> 38:19.207
They're gonna come for me.

38:22.077 --> 38:24.396
You want me to bring him down.

38:24.397 --> 38:26.037
If I go down...

38:27.047 --> 38:28.667
they go down.

38:29.617 --> 38:30.986
So what?

38:30.987 --> 38:33.247
You have some master plan?

38:34.527 --> 38:36.807
I'm gonna tell all.

38:38.557 --> 38:42.206
Senator, I haven't
seen you in three years.

38:42.207 --> 38:44.486
Yet you show up today
and you pick me up,

38:44.487 --> 38:47.337
and suddenly,
you're gonna tell all.

38:47.547 --> 38:49.076
Two days.

38:49.077 --> 38:52.277
I have some other things
I've got to do first.

38:54.677 --> 38:57.126
Did they kill my father?

38:57.127 --> 38:59.897
I have no proof of that.

39:02.867 --> 39:04.907
You got your two days.

39:17.037 --> 39:18.367
You okay?

39:18.967 --> 39:20.427
What is it?

39:21.207 --> 39:23.397
There's something
I have to tell you.

39:24.307 --> 39:26.166
And don’t judge me, okay?

39:26.167 --> 39:28.246
I'm just like you,
I was there, too, remember?

39:28.247 --> 39:30.556
And... I spent all this time

39:30.557 --> 39:32.777
trying to figure out who did it.

39:34.787 --> 39:36.927
I've been with Campbell.

39:43.227 --> 39:44.417
Okay.

39:45.457 --> 39:47.066
I sleep with him,

39:47.067 --> 39:50.157
trying to collect as much
information as I can.

39:51.137 --> 39:53.596
You want to be with a winner,
don't you, Loryn?

39:53.597 --> 39:56.287
You don't want to
be with a loser.

40:00.577 --> 40:02.557
You're my honey now.

40:06.417 --> 40:08.257
He and Hayden did it.

40:08.417 --> 40:10.086
I mean, I can't prove it.

40:10.087 --> 40:13.687
I mean, not yet, but...
I will soon.

40:14.427 --> 40:17.307
Well, those two were
always on top of our list.

40:26.687 --> 40:28.987
Here, I thought
you could use this.

40:32.477 --> 40:34.287
Hot chocolate?

40:35.277 --> 40:36.687
Thanks.

40:37.117 --> 40:38.567
Only three years.

40:40.087 --> 40:42.757
Quinn Grimaldi,
you are under arrest.

40:43.457 --> 40:44.976
He had friends.

40:44.977 --> 40:47.827
Senator Roswald and his gang?

40:47.857 --> 40:49.167
Yeah.

40:49.497 --> 40:52.077
You know the Senator
lost his reelection.

40:52.197 --> 40:54.846
Pretty soon, he won't
be able to protect anyone.

40:54.847 --> 40:56.657
I understand.

40:57.197 --> 40:58.787
But what about Quinn?

40:58.937 --> 41:00.017
Can't read him.

41:00.137 --> 41:01.477
If he's smart, he'll lay low,

41:01.478 --> 41:03.916
but he could go into
revenge mode.

41:03.917 --> 41:05.676
Maybe get back to business.

41:05.677 --> 41:07.027
Definitely him coming out of jail

41:07.028 --> 41:09.157
is gonna shake things up.

41:09.247 --> 41:10.997
Are you gonna greet him?

41:43.897 --> 41:45.357
Quinn!

41:46.947 --> 41:48.327
Yo!

41:49.517 --> 41:50.957
Quinn, it's me!

41:51.517 --> 41:53.636
It's me, come on, get in.

41:53.637 --> 41:55.036
Wow, you look well, bro!

41:55.037 --> 41:57.627
What, do you get filet mignon
every day in there?

41:58.157 --> 41:59.506
What, you pissed off?

41:59.507 --> 42:01.097
If I'm one minute late
after three years?

42:01.098 --> 42:02.257
Come on.

42:02.567 --> 42:04.676
Nah, you know, I feel like
stretching my legs.

42:04.677 --> 42:05.927
It was a little
cramped in there,

42:05.928 --> 42:07.586
as I'm sure you can understand.

42:07.587 --> 42:09.586
Forget the prison life.

42:09.587 --> 42:11.627
Get in here, I've got a great
party organized for you.

42:11.628 --> 42:13.026
- Come on.
- Where?

42:13.027 --> 42:15.207
- At the house.
- At the house?

42:15.547 --> 42:17.616
You're living
in my dad's house, yeah?

42:17.617 --> 42:19.045
I kept it in the family, for us.

42:19.046 --> 42:20.277
I got you a lovely suite there,

42:20.278 --> 42:22.366
you got your
own room... east wing.

42:22.367 --> 42:24.247
- Come on.
- Sounds like a good time.

42:24.248 --> 42:26.487
- We'll catch up.
- Quinn!

42:28.027 --> 42:30.407
Are you being... what,
you pissed off 'cause I'm late?

42:30.408 --> 42:31.947
What is it?

42:32.837 --> 42:34.546
Quinn, get in the car.

42:34.547 --> 42:35.905
You saved my life,
I saved yours.

42:35.906 --> 42:37.197
- We're brothers.
- That's right.

42:37.198 --> 42:39.236
And, brother,
I'm gonna see you soon.

42:39.237 --> 42:40.957
What, has that prison shit
got in you head?

42:40.958 --> 42:42.677
What's going on, Quinn?

42:42.937 --> 42:45.567
Three weeks I've been
doing this party, Quinn!

42:45.637 --> 42:48.097
We're brothers for life!

43:05.397 --> 43:07.357
My, my, my.

43:11.937 --> 43:13.057
Mm-mm-mm!

43:13.567 --> 43:17.057
Oh, ladies,
you are going to make my day.

43:20.517 --> 43:22.957
So, Senator,
how do you like us?

43:24.247 --> 43:25.897
Come on, come on.

43:26.417 --> 43:28.827
Let's test the waters.

43:43.337 --> 43:45.576
- Yeah.
<i>- Long time, no speak, Axel.</i>

43:45.577 --> 43:47.157
<i>It's Quinn.</i>

43:48.267 --> 43:50.996
<i>Look, I appreciate all
you've done so far,</i>

43:50.997 --> 43:53.157
<i>but how about you
give up the lone-wolf routine</i>

43:53.158 --> 43:55.726
<i>and team up with me and Loryn?</i>

43:55.727 --> 43:58.757
<i>Let's take down Hayden
and Campbell together.</i>

43:59.117 --> 44:01.047
<i>Say yes.</i>

44:02.217 --> 44:03.627
Yes.

44:04.617 --> 44:06.497
This complicates things.

44:06.987 --> 44:08.297
But I owe him.

44:10.897 --> 44:12.527
Campbell and Hayden's
printing business

44:12.528 --> 44:14.727
hinges on two components.

44:16.497 --> 44:19.577
First, the exclusive
forgery software.

44:20.037 --> 44:23.987
And second,
Boris laundering the money.

44:24.707 --> 44:26.527
We'll attack both.

44:26.977 --> 44:28.816
But getting
200 feet underground

44:28.817 --> 44:31.826
and stealing the software
won't be easy.

44:31.827 --> 44:34.297
You need and access key.

44:34.777 --> 44:36.957
And only one of us can get it.

44:45.457 --> 44:47.087
So where is he?

44:50.467 --> 44:52.487
I don't know and I don't care.

44:55.567 --> 44:57.497
Why don't I believe you?

44:59.307 --> 45:01.217
Yes, you do.

45:02.477 --> 45:04.287
Wanna know why?

45:05.577 --> 45:07.397
'Cause I'm your honey, baby.

45:08.487 --> 45:11.077
Why would I care
for a loser, hmm?

45:12.927 --> 45:15.257
Well, you know love
shouldn't be rationalized.

45:16.227 --> 45:18.277
Now that's a big word.

45:19.397 --> 45:20.737
What, rationalized?

45:21.497 --> 45:23.207
I was talking about love.

45:27.507 --> 45:29.557
I can be very good to you.

45:31.507 --> 45:32.767
I know.

45:39.287 --> 45:41.097
I don't know anything
about Quinn.

45:41.098 --> 45:43.197
Okay, I believe you.

45:43.887 --> 45:44.877
Are you sure?

45:46.327 --> 45:47.527
Yes.

46:01.937 --> 46:03.697
Loryn does her part.

46:04.907 --> 46:07.027
She has sacrificed the most.

47:12.237 --> 47:13.227
Police!

47:13.447 --> 47:15.367
- Open up!
- Oh, God!

47:15.947 --> 47:17.916
Police, open the door!

47:17.917 --> 47:19.347
Oh, God!

47:23.457 --> 47:24.847
Right.

47:27.587 --> 47:30.246
Senator Roswald has
been arrested for murder,

47:30.247 --> 47:32.246
claiming that he got framed.

47:32.247 --> 47:34.447
Two of Campbell's girls.

47:37.297 --> 47:38.487
He has been framed.

47:38.488 --> 47:40.266
- No doubt about it.
- Campbell?

47:40.267 --> 47:42.267
No, not Campbell.

47:42.567 --> 47:44.536
Campbell would have killed him.

47:44.537 --> 47:47.127
That's what
Roswald was scared of.

47:47.477 --> 47:49.307
This is someone else.

47:49.547 --> 47:51.687
Someone with a plan.

47:52.277 --> 47:54.136
Maybe the Senator will help us.

47:54.137 --> 47:55.796
Not a chance.

47:55.797 --> 47:57.526
Now that he's in jail,

47:57.527 --> 47:59.047
whatever he knows
is the only thing

47:59.048 --> 48:01.047
that's keeping him alive.

48:02.327 --> 48:04.807
Kurt... I'm serious.

48:05.257 --> 48:07.557
No more of that
Lone Ranger crap.

48:14.407 --> 48:17.057
The next bit is up to me.

48:17.337 --> 48:19.167
Separate Boris
from his bodyguard.

48:26.047 --> 48:27.347
Separated.

48:43.397 --> 48:44.966
What do you want?

48:44.967 --> 48:46.346
What do you want?

48:46.347 --> 48:48.106
Shh...

48:48.107 --> 48:49.376
Who are you?

48:49.377 --> 48:52.007
Tell us about Hayden's operation.

48:52.847 --> 48:54.327
I know your voice.

48:56.027 --> 48:58.087
That's not what I asked.

48:59.077 --> 49:00.816
I'm a dead man if I tell you.

49:00.817 --> 49:03.057
You're a dead man if you don't.

49:06.697 --> 49:09.507
Hayden isn't doing anything
different than Sergio used to.

49:11.447 --> 49:13.467
It's counterfeit money.

49:14.097 --> 49:16.036
- That's it?
- That's it.

49:16.037 --> 49:17.267
Ahh!

49:17.367 --> 49:19.167
Campbell's different!

49:20.037 --> 49:23.176
He runs a drug smuggling
on the side, okay?

49:23.177 --> 49:24.526
Hayden doesn't know.

49:24.527 --> 49:26.527
He would not approve.

49:28.247 --> 49:31.136
He has also taken over
a prostitution ring.

49:31.137 --> 49:34.557
Mostly...
Eastern European women.

49:34.677 --> 49:35.927
But...

49:36.287 --> 49:37.787
Keep talking.

49:38.557 --> 49:41.387
He uses them
in exchange of favors.

49:42.077 --> 49:43.387
What's that?

49:43.567 --> 49:45.327
Favors for what?

49:45.557 --> 49:48.057
Protection.

49:50.767 --> 49:52.887
Quinn... is that you?

49:53.137 --> 49:54.397
Quinn!

49:56.107 --> 49:57.297
Quinn!

49:57.407 --> 49:59.677
I've always been
a friend to you!

49:59.807 --> 50:01.027
Quinn!

50:01.147 --> 50:03.297
I've always been on your side!

50:10.117 --> 50:13.016
You know, this was Quinn's
and my place.

50:13.017 --> 50:14.556
But that was...

50:14.557 --> 50:16.737
a very long time ago.

50:18.597 --> 50:20.537
You know, your brother
did everything...

50:20.538 --> 50:23.206
absolutely everything
he could do to protect you.

50:23.207 --> 50:24.757
Yeah.

50:27.467 --> 50:29.877
I need to see him, Loryn.

50:30.137 --> 50:32.607
I get the feeling he
doesn't want to see me.

50:33.577 --> 50:34.866
What?

50:34.867 --> 50:36.587
What's so funny?

50:36.807 --> 50:39.046
You're just not the first
person to say that...

50:39.047 --> 50:40.467
all right?

50:46.627 --> 50:49.376
You know, I don't understand
how you're

50:49.377 --> 50:51.157
dating Campbell, Loryn.

50:52.627 --> 50:54.066
He's nice.

50:54.067 --> 50:55.746
He gives me stuff.

50:55.747 --> 50:58.157
I just didn't think
you were like that.

51:01.937 --> 51:04.397
So why did you
want to see me today?

51:08.377 --> 51:09.977
They're gonna kill you.

51:10.877 --> 51:12.947
Did Campbell tell you that?

51:14.217 --> 51:16.607
What if I kill him first?

51:17.517 --> 51:19.457
You don't know what
you're fighting against.

51:19.458 --> 51:20.746
What?

51:20.747 --> 51:22.366
Thugs with money?

51:22.367 --> 51:23.946
Thugs with power.

51:23.947 --> 51:25.556
First, Boris.

51:25.557 --> 51:27.217
Then, Roswald.

51:28.067 --> 51:29.547
They're afraid.

51:29.967 --> 51:32.697
And that means I'm doing something right.

51:46.217 --> 51:47.777
Stay here!

52:22.247 --> 52:23.547
Hey, man!

52:56.597 --> 52:58.056
<i>Agent Grimaldi,</i>

52:58.057 --> 53:00.577
<i>Campbell is on the move,
heading east.</i>

53:01.057 --> 53:03.657
<i>You can intercept at
Hollywood and Vine.</i>

53:24.897 --> 53:26.377
Surprised I'm not dead?!

53:27.287 --> 53:28.637
What the fuck
are you talking about?

53:28.638 --> 53:30.977
One of you guys just
tried to kill me!

53:31.487 --> 53:34.116
I don't kill cops
and I don't kill feds.

53:34.117 --> 53:36.117
Well, who was it then?

53:37.327 --> 53:39.977
I don't know and I don't care!

53:43.337 --> 53:45.857
Did you frame Senator Roswald?

53:46.637 --> 53:48.806
Let me give you some advice.

53:48.807 --> 53:51.497
You're in way too
far over your head.

53:51.937 --> 53:54.977
And you might wanna focus
on somebody else but me.

54:16.937 --> 54:17.917
Axel.

54:18.837 --> 54:20.787
We need to talk.

54:31.517 --> 54:33.806
Did you try to kill Kurt Grimaldi?

54:33.807 --> 54:35.496
What is fucking wrong with you?

54:35.497 --> 54:36.897
'Course not.

54:37.587 --> 54:40.377
- Did you?
- No.

54:43.967 --> 54:45.986
Listen, somebody sent me this.

54:45.987 --> 54:48.716
<i>He has also taken
over prostitution ring.</i>

54:48.717 --> 54:50.216
<i>Eastern European women.</i>

54:50.217 --> 54:51.046
Boris!

54:51.047 --> 54:53.776
<i>He uses them
in exchange of favors.</i>

54:53.777 --> 54:55.387
<i>Protection.</i>

55:19.157 --> 55:21.037
Are you sure?

55:24.567 --> 55:25.926
Quinn?

55:25.927 --> 55:27.527
Why?

55:29.957 --> 55:32.377
Did he say anything
about Sergio?

55:36.407 --> 55:38.447
Did he think I killed him?

55:39.017 --> 55:40.846
Maybe... I don't know.

55:40.847 --> 55:43.277
Well, that must be the reason.

55:44.417 --> 55:46.567
I'm going to have to talk to him.

55:48.957 --> 55:51.277
Do you know where
I can find him?

55:58.397 --> 56:00.377
What did you tell him?

56:01.837 --> 56:03.906
- Nothing.
- About the girls.

56:03.907 --> 56:05.607
And the drugs.

56:06.417 --> 56:08.336
I... I don't remember.

56:08.337 --> 56:09.917
I see.

56:13.737 --> 56:16.096
Did I ever tell you
I went to college?

56:16.097 --> 56:18.406
I studied medicine.

56:18.407 --> 56:21.027
Didn't learn nothing, though.

56:22.587 --> 56:25.257
But I did find out
how the brain works.

56:25.867 --> 56:28.937
Did you know we only use
a fraction of the brain?

56:30.067 --> 56:31.686
So I was wondering,

56:31.687 --> 56:34.736
what happens to
all that other information?

56:34.737 --> 56:36.977
And I worked it out.

56:37.577 --> 56:40.117
It's locked here in a library.

56:41.907 --> 56:43.386
What is your point?

56:43.387 --> 56:45.386
Well, don't you think
it would be amazing

56:45.387 --> 56:47.226
if a scientist could find out

56:47.227 --> 56:48.946
how to unlock that library

56:48.947 --> 56:51.447
and take out all
that information?

56:54.157 --> 56:56.747
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

56:58.197 --> 57:01.797
Did you tell him about
the girls or the drugs?

57:02.367 --> 57:04.147
I didn't say nothing.

57:08.207 --> 57:10.497
That's a good answer.

57:13.507 --> 57:15.387
But I don't believe you.

57:19.027 --> 57:21.007
I'm no scientist...

57:21.747 --> 57:23.956
but I'm gonna have to
find out a way to unlock

57:23.957 --> 57:26.596
your library and get
the information out of it.

57:26.597 --> 57:28.506
It is the truth.

57:28.507 --> 57:30.867
Your pupils dilated.

57:31.457 --> 57:33.297
It is the drugs.

57:33.797 --> 57:35.357
You're sweating.

57:35.397 --> 57:37.416
It's the drugs.

57:37.417 --> 57:39.157
Maybe.

57:39.867 --> 57:42.447
But I'm gonna
have to make sure.

57:43.137 --> 57:44.626
Please.

57:44.627 --> 57:46.266
Don't worry.

57:46.267 --> 57:48.517
It won't take a second.

57:48.877 --> 57:50.307
Please!

57:53.687 --> 57:54.857
Boss?

57:55.417 --> 57:57.127
I'm working!

58:02.357 --> 58:04.396
I hate to sit this one out,

58:04.397 --> 58:07.247
but I know they can
take care of themselves.

58:07.397 --> 58:09.537
I taught them that much.

58:16.507 --> 58:19.077
Only Quinn knows
his way inside.

58:19.377 --> 58:21.696
And I'm too tall
for the other part.

58:21.697 --> 58:23.747
- Hi.
- Hi.

59:06.517 --> 59:08.046
I need my desk now.

59:08.047 --> 59:09.705
Can you just go and clean
somewhere else, please?

59:09.706 --> 59:10.615
I'm nearly done.

59:10.616 --> 59:12.137
- Let me just finish...
- It's... it's fine like this.

59:12.138 --> 59:14.177
- Thank you.
- Okay.

59:14.497 --> 59:15.706
Oh, boy!

59:15.707 --> 59:17.796
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- Goddamn it!

59:17.797 --> 59:18.907
So silly of me.

59:18.908 --> 59:20.016
Idiot!

59:20.017 --> 59:22.436
Do you know how expensive
this equipment is?

59:22.437 --> 59:24.197
There we go.

59:24.437 --> 59:25.575
I'm almost done.

59:25.576 --> 59:26.947
I like to be really thorough.

59:26.948 --> 59:28.526
Just stop while you're ahead.

59:28.527 --> 59:31.597
I am not gonna tell
you one more time.

59:37.157 --> 59:38.546
All righty.

59:38.547 --> 59:41.256
So, let me know
if you need anything dusted

59:41.257 --> 59:46.006
or disinfected,
buffed, polished, uh, slowly.

59:46.007 --> 59:48.007
I do it all, okay.

59:48.597 --> 59:50.257
I'm leaving.

59:52.167 --> 59:53.466
Thank you.

59:53.467 --> 59:54.807
Bye-bye.

01:00:03.247 --> 01:00:04.927
Hello... anybody home?

01:00:20.267 --> 01:00:21.427
Oh, shit!

01:00:39.517 --> 01:00:41.167
Get in there.

01:01:34.577 --> 01:01:36.206
It must have been Quinn.

01:01:36.207 --> 01:01:38.517
He got away clean with
all the files.

01:01:38.837 --> 01:01:40.186
Not for long.

01:01:40.187 --> 01:01:42.047
Don't you worry,
I'll take care of that.

01:01:42.048 --> 01:01:44.377
That's a good thing.

01:01:47.147 --> 01:01:48.507
<i>I'm sure you know by now.</i>

01:01:48.508 --> 01:01:50.376
You better bring that back.

01:01:50.377 --> 01:01:51.796
You'll what, kill me?

01:01:51.797 --> 01:01:53.085
I didn't kill your father

01:01:53.086 --> 01:01:54.967
<i>and I didn't set you up, Quinn.</i>

01:01:54.968 --> 01:01:56.296
I know.

01:01:56.297 --> 01:01:57.186
What?

01:01:57.187 --> 01:01:58.747
Ask your uncle.

01:01:59.127 --> 01:02:01.917
<i>Meet me in St. Joseph's
in two hours.</i>

01:02:03.427 --> 01:02:04.827
Bring 15 million.

01:02:05.197 --> 01:02:06.997
I think it might come in handy.

01:02:11.647 --> 01:02:12.966
What did you do?

01:02:12.967 --> 01:02:14.636
What you talking about?

01:02:14.637 --> 01:02:16.066
Was that fucking Quinn?

01:02:16.067 --> 01:02:18.066
My mother will turn in her grave.

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:19.886
What'd that scum tell you, huh?

01:02:19.887 --> 01:02:20.895
What did he tell you?

01:02:20.896 --> 01:02:23.207
- What is fucking wrong with you?
- You ain't at the end of this.

01:02:23.208 --> 01:02:25.366
I set this whole fucking
thing up for you!

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:27.327
He's a scum!

01:02:27.457 --> 01:02:29.587
His own father didn't like him!

01:03:17.077 --> 01:03:19.157
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:30.127
And I still have to.

01:03:34.427 --> 01:03:36.047
Where's Quinn?

01:03:36.527 --> 01:03:38.416
You have the money?

01:03:38.417 --> 01:03:40.377
I'm not dealing with you.

01:03:41.427 --> 01:03:43.527
You should make that an option.

01:03:44.297 --> 01:03:47.206
My best option
would be to kill you.

01:03:47.207 --> 01:03:49.207
That would be stupid.

01:03:49.437 --> 01:03:51.087
But very rewarding.

01:03:51.957 --> 01:03:54.827
Only if you believe
in life after death.

01:04:02.387 --> 01:04:05.236
That's a smart trick
for somebody like you.

01:04:05.237 --> 01:04:08.167
See, I thought you was
dumb... real dumb.

01:04:08.817 --> 01:04:11.156
Especially after
that with Sergio.

01:04:11.157 --> 01:04:13.867
Leaving him and then
having him killed.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:15.807
Are you done?

01:04:16.897 --> 01:04:19.267
Axel, we both know you're
not gonna let that grenade off

01:04:19.268 --> 01:04:20.947
in this church.

01:04:21.267 --> 01:04:23.287
Try me.

01:04:24.707 --> 01:04:26.947
Let's get down to business.

01:04:28.607 --> 01:04:30.036
I brought the money.

01:04:30.037 --> 01:04:32.037
Now where's the hard drive?

01:04:39.317 --> 01:04:40.307
Open the bag.

01:04:41.017 --> 01:04:43.537
Take out a bill and burn it.

01:04:51.867 --> 01:04:52.857
Is that good?

01:04:53.267 --> 01:04:55.627
An original, no copies.

01:05:06.377 --> 01:05:08.077
Happy now?

01:05:12.587 --> 01:05:14.926
So you gents
want to help me out?

01:05:14.927 --> 01:05:16.647
My car is outside.

01:05:23.847 --> 01:05:25.407
Have a nice day!

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:30.837
It's a dud.

01:05:33.107 --> 01:05:34.777
You bastard.

01:05:54.597 --> 01:05:57.076
Man: He's heading
south on La Cienega.

01:05:57.077 --> 01:05:58.817
Turn right at the next light.

01:06:17.247 --> 01:06:18.557
Ahh...

01:06:27.227 --> 01:06:29.796
Of course,
I've been waiting for her.

01:06:29.797 --> 01:06:31.517
Let her in.

01:06:48.317 --> 01:06:50.677
I poured you a drink.

01:07:53.477 --> 01:07:55.096
He's somewhere in here.

01:07:55.097 --> 01:07:56.837
We got him trapped.

01:08:32.487 --> 01:08:33.866
Let's head for the car.

01:08:33.867 --> 01:08:36.067
Let's flush this fucker out.

01:08:51.557 --> 01:08:52.666
There he is!

01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:54.466
Kill the son of a bitch!

01:10:01.367 --> 01:10:04.826
"Brothers for life"
is a relative term.

01:10:04.827 --> 01:10:06.707
Pardon the pun.

01:10:08.947 --> 01:10:10.907
Well, let's do this.

01:11:30.597 --> 01:11:34.607
Thank you so much, thanks.

01:12:21.547 --> 01:12:23.606
My father...

01:12:23.607 --> 01:12:26.257
wants to end all of it.

01:12:27.057 --> 01:12:29.187
What do you want?

01:12:34.927 --> 01:12:36.217
I spent all this time

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.517
trying to figure out
who did it, too.

01:13:03.587 --> 01:13:05.867
Get out with Loryn
while you still can.

01:13:17.047 --> 01:13:18.606
End it now.

01:13:18.607 --> 01:13:20.606
Too many moving parts.

01:13:20.607 --> 01:13:22.787
This won't end well.

01:13:26.687 --> 01:13:28.927
I need a shower.

01:13:38.977 --> 01:13:40.797
I need a drink.

01:13:58.847 --> 01:14:01.797
Dead men can't tell stories.

01:14:06.457 --> 01:14:08.526
Stories about a son

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:11.927
who couldn't bear the thought
of losing an empire.

01:14:15.367 --> 01:14:17.907
The son who had
his own father killed.

01:14:20.047 --> 01:14:21.546
And orchestrated events

01:14:21.547 --> 01:14:24.117
to make it appear
as if he was set up.

01:14:24.717 --> 01:14:26.717
Well, the list of
enemies is pretty long.

01:14:28.107 --> 01:14:30.726
They want us to think
Boris is behind the attack.

01:14:30.727 --> 01:14:32.647
I was expecting Mr. Huang.

01:14:33.877 --> 01:14:35.757
I don't think
it's about the money.

01:14:35.758 --> 01:14:38.766
Axel: Murdered innocent people
to set up a politician.

01:14:38.767 --> 01:14:40.907
It's always about the money.

01:14:41.937 --> 01:14:44.666
He even willingly spent
three years in prison

01:14:44.667 --> 01:14:47.617
just to convince
everyone he was innocent.

01:14:47.997 --> 01:14:50.386
- It's too late, Pa.
- It's never too late.

01:14:50.387 --> 01:14:52.877
His own father didn't like him!

01:15:12.557 --> 01:15:13.697
Quinn?

01:15:32.367 --> 01:15:34.096
This won't end well.

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:35.886
Too many moving parts.

01:15:35.887 --> 01:15:37.346
You got a contact?

01:15:37.347 --> 01:15:39.167
Give me your phone.

01:15:39.747 --> 01:15:41.266
We spoke over the phone.

01:15:41.267 --> 01:15:43.427
Axel, we need to talk.

01:15:44.697 --> 01:15:48.257
Like I said,
don't drink, stay sharp,

01:15:49.057 --> 01:15:52.217
and be prepared to take
a bullet from your client.

01:16:09.577 --> 01:16:12.327
This is the story of a dead man.

01:16:13.417 --> 01:16:16.357
A dead man
named Quinn Grimaldi.

01:16:37.407 --> 01:16:39.166
Completed my part of the deal.

01:16:39.167 --> 01:16:41.056
I knew you would come through.

01:16:41.057 --> 01:16:42.146
As promised.

01:16:42.147 --> 01:16:45.907
I, uh...
got your FBI file.

01:16:48.047 --> 01:16:50.147
You're a free man, Axel.

01:16:52.857 --> 01:16:54.377
Thanks.

01:17:02.797 --> 01:17:04.607
Sorry about your brother.

01:17:05.337 --> 01:17:06.806
Family's close.

01:17:06.807 --> 01:17:10.347
But I've learned
friends are closer.

01:17:15.677 --> 01:17:17.507
- So long, buddy.
- All right.

01:17:18.117 --> 01:17:20.427
Your father was a good man.

01:17:20.467 --> 01:17:22.857
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

01:17:26.487 --> 01:17:28.027
Hey, Axel!

01:17:30.157 --> 01:17:32.356
I may call on you soon.

01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:34.857
Don't go too far.

01:17:56.417 --> 01:17:59.137
My job was to
keep people alive.

01:18:00.027 --> 01:18:02.797
But I had to kill the man
I was hired to protect.

01:18:04.027 --> 01:18:05.507
Next time...

01:18:05.767 --> 01:18:07.907
I'll choose my clients
more carefully.
