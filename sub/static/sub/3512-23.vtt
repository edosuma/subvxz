00:02.516 --> 00:04.906
297 wedding gifts!

00:04.938 --> 00:06.005
It's a minor miracle.

00:06.039 --> 00:08.007
Our final total is below 300.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.510
There. I am done.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.846
500 autographed copies of "Wild Storm."

00:12.880 --> 00:16.148
My pre-wedding signing
obligations are finished.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.283
Good. Now sign <i>this.</i>

00:17.317 --> 00:18.351
What's this one?

00:18.386 --> 00:20.186
Final payment for the rooftop venue.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.755
You mean the <i>perfect</i> venue...

00:21.789 --> 00:24.357
a 360-degree view of Manhattan,

00:24.391 --> 00:27.093
the stars above us,
the world at our feet.

00:27.127 --> 00:28.928
It's too bad Beckett didn't want
to bungee-jump

00:28.962 --> 00:30.763
off the side of the building
for our big exit.

00:30.797 --> 00:32.598
Now, <i>that</i> would've been cool.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.566
The tuxes will be in tomorrow evening.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.269
Did you tell Esposito and Ryan?

00:36.303 --> 00:39.605
I did. They will be here to
try them on and to collect them.

00:39.639 --> 00:42.808
You are the most adorable
best man a groom could hope for.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.212
Ah. Probably the concierge
with more gifts.

00:47.246 --> 00:49.080
Ah. Hi, Gerard.

00:49.115 --> 00:51.383
Put them over there
with the others. Thank you.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.718
All right. I'm out.

00:53.752 --> 00:55.020
Bye.

00:55.054 --> 00:57.655
Dad! Don't forget the forms
for the marriage license!

00:58.991 --> 01:01.259
Those are my case files.

01:01.294 --> 01:03.929
Ask your questions, because I
will be pretty much unreachable

01:03.963 --> 01:05.863
for the next three weeks.

01:05.898 --> 01:07.232
Okay.

01:07.266 --> 01:09.600
What are you more excited about,
the wedding or the honeymoon?

01:09.635 --> 01:11.168
Three weeks in the Maldives
on a private island?

01:11.202 --> 01:12.470
What do you think?

01:12.504 --> 01:14.104
Actually, the only thing
I'm <i>not</i> excited about

01:14.139 --> 01:15.973
is having to say my vows
in front of all those people.

01:16.007 --> 01:17.274
Oh, you'll be fine.

01:17.309 --> 01:19.410
Just imagine your wedding guests
are, uh, murder suspects.

01:19.445 --> 01:20.812
In their underwear.

01:20.846 --> 01:22.012
Or not.

01:22.047 --> 01:24.014
You know, I was so nervous
before my wedding

01:24.049 --> 01:26.451
that I ran into a wall
and got a black eye.

01:26.485 --> 01:28.486
You're <i>supposed</i> to be a wreck.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.620
You're about to experience

01:29.655 --> 01:31.656
one of the most important days
of your life.

01:31.690 --> 01:33.657
I'm so happy for you, detective.

01:33.691 --> 01:34.724
Hey, guys!

01:34.759 --> 01:36.993
In spite of who you're marrying.

01:37.027 --> 01:39.596
So, who's ready
to get her marriage license?

01:39.630 --> 01:42.666
Me... almost. I got to get my bag.

01:42.700 --> 01:43.667
Excellent.

01:43.701 --> 01:45.068
And Alexis wanted me to remind you...

01:45.102 --> 01:46.503
She called, she texted,
and she e-mailed.

01:46.537 --> 01:48.137
We will be there.

01:48.172 --> 01:49.305
And we'll bring our black shoes.

01:49.340 --> 01:50.674
Do you have our paperwork?

01:50.708 --> 01:51.942
I do.

01:51.976 --> 01:53.577
I'm just practicing. I...

01:53.611 --> 01:54.578
I do. I got it.

01:54.612 --> 01:56.212
Have fun, guys.

01:58.949 --> 02:02.185
T-minus 72 hours until we are married.

02:02.219 --> 02:03.519
It feels like a dream.

02:03.553 --> 02:05.621
- That's 'cause I'm dreamy.
- Oh, shush.

02:05.655 --> 02:07.290
- Next!
- Ah.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.893
Here we are.

02:10.926 --> 02:13.463
Mr. Richard Castle
and Ms. Katherine Beckett.

02:13.497 --> 02:14.663
That's us.

02:14.698 --> 02:16.132
Proof of divorce?

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.208 --> 02:27.275
I... is there something wrong
with my documents?

02:27.310 --> 02:29.144
They're in order.

02:29.178 --> 02:31.179
Ms. Beckett, do you have <i>yours?</i>

02:31.214 --> 02:32.647
Pardon me?

02:32.681 --> 02:34.549
Your divorce paperwork.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.485
I'm sorry. There's a mistake.

02:36.519 --> 02:38.453
I've... I've never been married.

02:38.488 --> 02:41.523
Well, according to this, you <i>have.</i>

02:41.557 --> 02:43.157
And it looks like you still are.

02:43.191 --> 02:44.658
I'm married?

02:44.692 --> 02:45.626
To whom?

02:45.660 --> 02:47.694
Rogan O'Leary?!

02:47.729 --> 02:49.830
Well, who <i>is</i> Rogan O'Leary?

02:49.864 --> 02:51.598
A guy she met freshman year at Stanford.

02:51.633 --> 02:53.167
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

02:53.201 --> 02:54.668
And you married him?

02:54.702 --> 02:56.303
Not really.

02:56.338 --> 02:57.905
Except she did.

02:57.939 --> 03:00.241
The two of them drove to Vegas,
had too much to drink,

03:00.275 --> 03:01.909
and thought it would be a riot

03:01.943 --> 03:03.810
to take a cab to
a drivethrough wedding chapel.

03:03.845 --> 03:04.811
You didn't.

03:04.846 --> 03:06.680
- She did.
- Yeah, I did,

03:06.714 --> 03:08.349
but I never thought
that it was for real.

03:08.383 --> 03:10.417
And I broke up with the guy
a couple weeks later

03:10.451 --> 03:12.419
after I found out
he was a compulsive liar,

03:12.453 --> 03:15.221
degenerate, and a thief.

03:15.256 --> 03:17.057
Yes, but not before you tied the knot.

03:17.091 --> 03:19.392
And here I thought you were
a one-and-done kind of girl.

03:19.427 --> 03:21.227
Does your father know about this?

03:23.297 --> 03:24.597
I really am gonna be sick.

03:25.966 --> 03:27.367
And that'll be my lawyer.

03:29.370 --> 03:31.071
You were both over 18.

03:31.105 --> 03:34.407
Regardless of your seriousness
or intent at the time,

03:34.442 --> 03:37.944
I'm afraid your wedding
at the drive thru of love

03:37.978 --> 03:40.846
was real, legal, and binding.

03:40.881 --> 03:45.618
Okay. We are getting married
in <i>three</i> days.

03:45.652 --> 03:46.819
I'm afraid you can't.

03:46.853 --> 03:48.554
Not unless you terminate
your first marriage.

03:48.589 --> 03:53.025
We have 300 people coming.
Most of them are flying in.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.727
So what are we gonna say to all of them?

03:54.761 --> 03:58.664
Henry, is there <i>anything</i>
we can do to make this go away?

03:58.699 --> 04:01.399
It's possible...
if there's mutual consent.

04:01.433 --> 04:03.434
I brought a dissolution-
of-marriage contract,

04:03.469 --> 04:06.805
and I could expedite it
through the city, but...

04:06.839 --> 04:08.974
you'll have to get Mr. O'Leary
to sign it, too.

04:09.008 --> 04:11.042
How? It's been 15 years.

04:11.077 --> 04:12.911
I have no idea where he is.

04:13.913 --> 04:15.179
Okay, looks like we found him,

04:15.214 --> 04:17.616
- but, man, is your husband a piece of work.
- Mm.

04:17.649 --> 04:19.450
He's <i>not</i> my husband!

04:19.485 --> 04:20.885
Except, legally, he <i>is.</i>

04:20.920 --> 04:22.487
So, what do we know about him?

04:22.521 --> 04:23.989
Well, your boy got around.

04:24.023 --> 04:25.657
He was charged with theft
in Austin in '05.

04:25.691 --> 04:28.158
He did time for a D.U.I. in Iowa in '07.

04:28.192 --> 04:30.828
He was arrested for fraud
in Kentucky, and...

04:30.862 --> 04:32.229
oh! This is a good one.

04:32.263 --> 04:33.731
He was put in jail

04:33.765 --> 04:36.233
for impersonating an FBI agent
in New Orleans.

04:36.267 --> 04:37.668
I must say, given his record,

04:37.702 --> 04:39.943
I'm really surprised you stayed
with him all these years.

04:41.506 --> 04:42.873
Do you know where he is now?

04:42.907 --> 04:44.341
Yeah, looks like he settled

04:44.375 --> 04:45.809
in a small town in upstate New York

04:45.844 --> 04:47.445
called Willow Creek
about five years ago.

04:47.478 --> 04:49.279
Do you have his contact information?

04:49.313 --> 04:51.314
Texting right now.

04:51.349 --> 04:53.684
<i>The voice-mail for...</i>

04:53.718 --> 04:55.119
<i>Rogan O'Leary.</i>

04:55.153 --> 04:56.620
<i>...is full.</i>
<i>Please try again later.</i>

04:56.654 --> 04:57.787
I'm not getting through.

04:57.821 --> 04:59.422
Either the phone rings incessantly

04:59.457 --> 05:01.458
or I get
the "voice-mail is full" message.

05:03.147 --> 05:05.583
So, what do you want to do?

05:05.609 --> 05:07.777
I want to get married.
What do <i>you</i> want to do?

05:07.812 --> 05:08.779
I want to get married, too.

05:08.805 --> 05:10.205
Okay. Then it's settled.

05:10.223 --> 05:12.158
You'll stay here
and keep the wedding on track.

05:12.192 --> 05:13.860
And... you?

05:13.887 --> 05:15.855
I'm gonna go to Willow Creek.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.981
I've got less than three days
to find Rogan O'Leary

05:18.016 --> 05:19.550
and get a divorce.

05:19.585 --> 05:24.585
Castle 6x23 - For Better Or Worse

05:24.617 --> 05:27.617
www.addic7ed.com

05:55.375 --> 05:57.510
He's not worth it.

05:57.544 --> 05:59.011
Pardon me?

05:59.046 --> 06:01.914
Sweetie, I've been his neighbor
for five years.

06:01.948 --> 06:05.484
He's got a smile that will
make your pants fall off.

06:05.519 --> 06:07.686
But trust me... he's trouble.

06:09.356 --> 06:11.023
Do you know where I can find him?

06:14.094 --> 06:15.727
Don't say I didn't warn you.

06:20.366 --> 06:21.567
Excuse me.

06:21.601 --> 06:24.369
Hey. I'm looking
for one of your bartenders.

06:24.403 --> 06:25.837
Rogan O'Leary?

06:25.872 --> 06:26.705
Aah!

06:26.739 --> 06:28.674
Come on, Tildy!

06:29.809 --> 06:30.809
Never mind.

06:30.843 --> 06:32.343
Gimme a break!

06:32.378 --> 06:35.080
You want a break?
I'll give you a break.

06:35.114 --> 06:36.715
Oh!

06:36.749 --> 06:38.249
What the hell did I do?!

06:38.284 --> 06:41.285
What did you do?!
How about what <i>didn't</i> you do?!

06:41.319 --> 06:43.921
I thought you came here to apologize,

06:43.956 --> 06:45.756
to tell me how sorry you are!

06:45.791 --> 06:48.125
But no! All you want
is your stuff back?!

06:48.159 --> 06:50.294
It's not even <i>your</i> stuff!

06:50.328 --> 06:51.629
It's <i>our</i> stuff.

06:51.663 --> 06:53.864
And I... I... I need it
to make things right.

06:53.899 --> 06:55.265
I'm through!

06:55.300 --> 06:57.434
Now, get out of my bar!

06:57.469 --> 06:58.636
Come on, babe.

06:58.670 --> 07:00.738
You know you don't mean that.

07:00.772 --> 07:02.506
You love me too much.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.843
How's that for love?

07:15.152 --> 07:17.120
Kit Kat?

07:17.154 --> 07:19.990
Is that you?

07:20.024 --> 07:22.291
Hello, Rogan.

07:22.326 --> 07:25.428
So, I see you haven't changed.

07:25.462 --> 07:26.596
Oh.

07:26.631 --> 07:28.197
What? That?

07:28.232 --> 07:29.666
Nah.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.534
Come on, that was just a, uh...

07:31.568 --> 07:35.904
that was just a lovers' quarrel,
as they say.

07:35.939 --> 07:37.740
So...

07:40.043 --> 07:43.612
So, Kit Kat, what brings you
to Willow Creek, huh?

07:43.647 --> 07:45.648
You walking the nostalgia trail?

07:45.682 --> 07:48.884
Tracking down old flames
to discover who you really are?

07:48.918 --> 07:49.952
Uh... no.

07:49.986 --> 07:52.420
Do you remember a trip
that we took to Vegas?

07:54.723 --> 07:56.691
I don't know. It's a little fuzzy.

07:56.725 --> 07:59.694
But, uh, most - of my best memories <i>are.</i>

08:00.863 --> 08:03.198
So, when we were there, do you recall

08:03.232 --> 08:06.201
a cab ride and a drive-up chapel?

08:06.235 --> 08:09.638
Nope, but I do recall
a dine-and-dash on the strip.

08:09.672 --> 08:11.792
Huh? Do you remember... with the hoagies?

08:11.807 --> 08:14.442
At the counter...
"hey, you! Get out of there!"

08:14.477 --> 08:16.478
Um, well, you know what... you're
probably gonna find this funny,

08:16.512 --> 08:18.112
but, as it turns out,

08:18.147 --> 08:24.152
you and I have been...
married for...15 years.

08:24.187 --> 08:26.119
- Married?
- Mm-hmm.

08:26.154 --> 08:27.621
For realsies?

08:27.656 --> 08:28.789
Yeah.

08:28.823 --> 08:29.956
That is hilarious!

08:29.991 --> 08:32.193
Wha... how long have you known that?

08:32.227 --> 08:34.027
I just found out.

08:34.062 --> 08:35.696
But you know what...
it's not a big deal,

08:35.730 --> 08:38.399
because all you have to do is...

08:38.433 --> 08:40.601
sign this...

08:40.635 --> 08:42.001
and you're off the hook.

08:42.035 --> 08:44.004
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:44.038 --> 08:45.706
Yeah.

08:47.108 --> 08:49.343
But, you know, it's, uh...

08:49.377 --> 08:52.812
it <i>is</i> a pretty nice hook, you know?

08:52.846 --> 08:54.447
I mean, heck, we <i>have</i>
been married this long.

08:54.481 --> 08:57.083
Maybe we should
just give it a chance, uh...

08:57.117 --> 08:59.452
No. I know, I know.

09:01.522 --> 09:05.425
So, uh... it must be
pretty important to you

09:05.459 --> 09:07.527
to have me sign these forms, then, huh?

09:07.561 --> 09:09.895
You know, if you've driven
all the way from...?

09:09.930 --> 09:10.763
New York.

09:10.797 --> 09:12.332
New York.

09:12.366 --> 09:14.467
Let me guess... lawyer?

09:15.436 --> 09:16.402
Detective.

09:16.437 --> 09:18.338
Detective!

09:18.372 --> 09:20.272
Yeah... NYPD.

09:20.306 --> 09:21.273
Wow.

09:21.307 --> 09:22.975
So, tell me, how does a girl go

09:23.009 --> 09:25.277
from picking the lock
on Pearl Jam's tour bus

09:25.311 --> 09:27.613
so she can steal
Eddie Vedder's jean jacket

09:27.647 --> 09:29.514
to becoming a cop?

09:29.549 --> 09:32.151
I...

09:32.185 --> 09:34.120
You know, I'm sorry.

09:34.154 --> 09:36.588
I... I... you're obviously busy,
and I should probably just go.

09:36.623 --> 09:38.523
Um, but if you could just sign this...

09:38.558 --> 09:39.825
No. Yeah. Of course.

09:39.860 --> 09:41.861
I'd lo... I... I would...
I would really love to sign

09:41.895 --> 09:43.863
this dissolution-of-marriage
agreement for you.

09:43.897 --> 09:45.264
Great.

09:45.298 --> 09:49.334
But... you're gonna have to do
something for <i>me</i> first.

09:52.171 --> 09:54.373
Okay.

09:54.407 --> 09:55.807
Which one?

09:55.841 --> 09:57.409
The easy one, which is this one.

09:57.443 --> 09:58.443
Thank you.

09:58.478 --> 10:00.912
Any news from Beckett?

10:00.946 --> 10:02.847
Uh, she texted me a couple hours ago...

10:02.882 --> 10:05.123
said she'd found him, but I
haven't heard from her since.

10:05.151 --> 10:06.885
Maybe they're catching up.

10:06.919 --> 10:08.387
Sure. No, sure.
They got a lot in common.

10:08.421 --> 10:10.255
She can talk about all
the people she's put in prison,

10:10.290 --> 10:12.223
and he can talk about all
the people he's <i>met</i> in prison.

10:12.258 --> 10:15.993
Um, Alexis, I haven't gained
this much daddy weight.

10:16.027 --> 10:17.161
That can't be right.

10:17.195 --> 10:18.996
I double-checked the size 10 times.

10:19.030 --> 10:21.666
Hey, maybe you finally hit that growth
spurt you've been waiting on, bro.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.567
Oh.

10:24.803 --> 10:25.936
And that's her.

10:25.970 --> 10:27.838
Hey. What's up?

10:27.872 --> 10:30.741
Okay, so, there has been
a little glitch.

10:30.776 --> 10:32.643
- He won't sign?
- Oh, no. He'll sign,

10:32.678 --> 10:34.645
but he wants me to do something first.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.846
What kind of thing?

10:35.880 --> 10:37.147
He wants me to break into

10:37.182 --> 10:39.917
his ex-girlfriend's truck
and steal a garage-door opener.

10:39.951 --> 10:42.252
O... kay. Why?

10:42.287 --> 10:44.822
Apparently, after they broke up,

10:44.856 --> 10:46.489
his ex-girlfriend took
a few of his things,

10:46.524 --> 10:47.991
and he wants them back.

10:48.026 --> 10:51.628
And he needs the garage-door
opener to get into her place?

10:51.662 --> 10:53.697
Her... mom's place, but yeah.

10:53.731 --> 10:56.051
But given his record, why doesn't
he just steal it himself?

10:56.067 --> 10:58.568
Because her truck is parked
right outside of her bar,

10:58.602 --> 11:00.304
and he can't get close to it

11:00.338 --> 11:02.306
without someone spotting him
and then telling her.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.441
And you're actually thinking
about doing this?

11:04.475 --> 11:06.310
If I don't, he won't sign.

11:06.344 --> 11:08.611
Castle, he could drag this on for years.

11:08.646 --> 11:10.247
And if you get caught?

11:10.281 --> 11:11.748
I won't.

11:11.782 --> 11:14.151
Look, Castle,
he's got me over a barrel here.

11:14.185 --> 11:16.419
If I don't do this,
we don't get married.

11:18.689 --> 11:21.257
Just get this over with and come home.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.759
I'll call you when I'm done.

12:09.273 --> 12:11.240
Mission accomplished.

12:11.275 --> 12:12.674
So, you got the remote?

12:12.709 --> 12:14.377
Yes. And I wasn't caught.

12:14.411 --> 12:16.578
And you're sure
he'll sign the papers now?

12:16.613 --> 12:18.381
Oh, he's gonna sign them, all right.

12:18.415 --> 12:20.849
I'm not taking "no" for an answer.

12:20.884 --> 12:23.786
Tell everyone that this wedding is on.

12:23.820 --> 12:25.954
I'll be on my way back to the city soon.

12:25.988 --> 12:27.790
- Can't wait.
- Bye.

12:30.794 --> 12:32.694
Get back here, Rogan!

12:39.402 --> 12:41.569
- All right, man! All right!
- Rogan!

12:41.603 --> 12:43.538
Hey! Hey!

12:43.572 --> 12:45.473
Hey! Hey! Hey!!

12:46.675 --> 12:48.509
Stop!

12:54.149 --> 12:55.149
Really?!

13:02.820 --> 13:04.300
Did you get the license of the truck?

13:04.342 --> 13:05.608
It didn't have one.

13:05.643 --> 13:07.244
But both of the men were wearing masks.

13:07.278 --> 13:09.846
And your friend who got taken...
what's his name?

13:09.880 --> 13:11.313
Rogan... Rogan O'Leary.

13:14.689 --> 13:16.122
What... why are you
closing your notebook?

13:16.156 --> 13:18.124
Ma'am, our department
doesn't have the resources

13:18.158 --> 13:21.695
to investigate every claim
involving Mr. O'Leary.

13:21.729 --> 13:23.430
But someone took him.

13:23.464 --> 13:24.531
I'm sure they did.

13:24.565 --> 13:26.005
I'm sure they had a very good reason.

13:26.033 --> 13:27.600
And in a few days,

13:27.635 --> 13:30.169
he'll show up drunk, bruised,
and sorry as hell.

13:30.204 --> 13:33.440
I don't have a few days.
I need to find him <i>now.</i>

13:33.474 --> 13:37.711
Ma'am, from one woman to another...

13:37.745 --> 13:39.746
let him go.

13:42.615 --> 13:45.617
He's been abducted?! H... how... but...

13:45.652 --> 13:47.954
- I know. I don't believe it, either.
- O... okay.

13:47.988 --> 13:50.890
I hate to ask, but do you think
maybe we should postpone?

13:50.924 --> 13:52.859
No. No, I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna find him.

13:52.893 --> 13:54.327
- How?
- Well, I'm a detective.

13:54.361 --> 13:55.761
Someone here has to know something.

13:55.762 --> 13:57.997
You shouldn't be doing this alone.
I'm coming up there.

13:58.031 --> 13:59.899
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

13:59.933 --> 14:02.335
Absolutely. E... everything here
is completely under control.

14:02.369 --> 14:04.971
I... I will see you in a few hours.

14:05.005 --> 14:06.339
Bye.

14:11.678 --> 14:12.644
Hello?

14:12.679 --> 14:14.145
Yes, this is Richard Castle.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.353
What?

14:21.388 --> 14:23.321
We lost our venue?

14:23.356 --> 14:24.990
How is that even possible?!

14:25.024 --> 14:26.725
They had a circus party there tonight

14:26.760 --> 14:28.394
with some first-time fire breathers.

14:28.428 --> 14:30.729
Now our rooftop venue
does not have a floor.

14:30.764 --> 14:32.163
This is a disaster.

14:32.198 --> 14:34.065
No place to get married
and no one to get married <i>to.</i>

14:34.100 --> 14:35.900
I think "disaster" is an understatement.

14:35.934 --> 14:39.236
So-called "disaster" is
merely opportunity in disguise.

14:39.271 --> 14:40.838
We'll just find another place
to hold the wedding.

14:40.873 --> 14:42.039
Are you kidding?

14:42.073 --> 14:43.708
Where are we gonna find
a venue in Manhattan

14:43.742 --> 14:46.778
that holds 300 people...
in less than two days?

14:46.812 --> 14:48.713
Ooh! We already have one.

14:48.747 --> 14:50.715
Not in Manhattan.

14:50.749 --> 14:53.684
We can move the whole party
to our house in the Hamptons.

14:53.719 --> 14:54.952
Yes.

14:54.986 --> 14:56.454
Yes!

14:56.488 --> 14:58.790
We've held larger parties
than this out there.

14:58.824 --> 15:00.590
We rent luxury buses
to shuttle our guests

15:00.625 --> 15:02.893
and pay the vendors'
transportation costs.

15:02.928 --> 15:04.194
Brilliant!

15:04.229 --> 15:05.329
I will call the housekeeper
first thing in the morning

15:05.363 --> 15:07.083
and have them start
getting the place ready.

15:07.098 --> 15:08.399
You really think we can pull this off?

15:08.433 --> 15:09.699
Oh, please!

15:09.734 --> 15:12.636
I once staged "A Chorus Line"
on a subway platform

15:12.670 --> 15:14.571
when our company lost its space.

15:14.605 --> 15:16.440
I think I can move a wedding.

15:16.474 --> 15:18.375
Alexis will help with everything.

15:18.410 --> 15:19.910
You just make sure

15:19.945 --> 15:24.347
Katherine finds
that deadbeat husband of hers.

15:24.381 --> 15:25.614
Yes.

15:27.584 --> 15:29.752
Thanks for coming up, babe.

15:29.786 --> 15:32.288
I'm so sorry about this whole mess.

15:32.323 --> 15:34.324
Oh, what's a fiancé for,
if not to help find

15:34.358 --> 15:35.959
his future wife's current husband?

15:35.993 --> 15:38.294
And Alexis and mother
will get far more done

15:38.329 --> 15:39.862
without my interference.

15:39.896 --> 15:41.764
Well, I just hope that all
their work is not for nothing.

15:41.798 --> 15:43.833
You think Rogan's ex will be
able to help us find him?

15:43.867 --> 15:45.000
They lived together.

15:45.034 --> 15:47.269
If we're lucky,
she'll be able to tell us

15:47.303 --> 15:49.772
what kind of mess he was mixed up in.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.640
Can I help you?

15:51.675 --> 15:54.242
Uh, hi, ma'am.

15:54.277 --> 15:57.847
NYPD. We're looking for Rogan O'Leary.

15:57.881 --> 16:00.015
Well, if you find him, you can keep him.

16:00.049 --> 16:01.489
Stop it, mama.

16:03.853 --> 16:05.520
You were in the bar yesterday.

16:05.554 --> 16:08.357
Yeah, I was hoping
that Mr. O'Leary could help us

16:08.391 --> 16:09.992
with... an old case,

16:10.026 --> 16:12.027
but it seems that he was
abducted last night.

16:12.061 --> 16:13.095
By who?

16:13.129 --> 16:15.297
We were hoping you could tell <i>us.</i>

16:15.331 --> 16:17.854
Wasn't me. I'd have offed him.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.933
Mama, that's enough!

16:19.969 --> 16:22.037
Look, he was taken by two men
in a rusty pickup truck.

16:22.071 --> 16:23.904
Do you have any idea who they were?

16:23.938 --> 16:25.006
No.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.808
But he's always working crazy angles,

16:27.842 --> 16:29.543
pissing people off.

16:29.577 --> 16:30.811
Is that why you left him?

16:30.845 --> 16:32.279
No.

16:32.314 --> 16:33.981
I was used to that.

16:34.016 --> 16:36.950
But he took money from me
for one of his schemes...

16:36.985 --> 16:38.852
said he was gonna make us rich.

16:38.887 --> 16:41.655
He lost it all, of course.
Now I might lose the bar.

16:41.689 --> 16:45.958
Thing is, in spite of it all...

16:45.993 --> 16:47.627
I love him.

16:47.661 --> 16:49.795
I mean, I can overlook the fact that...

16:49.830 --> 16:52.032
that he's not
a "regular job" kind of guy

16:52.066 --> 16:54.467
or that he can't marry me
while his wife's in a coma,

16:54.502 --> 16:58.505
but he should never have
put my bar in jeopardy.

16:58.539 --> 17:01.974
I'm sorry... he said that he had a wife?

17:02.009 --> 17:04.309
A wife in a coma?

17:04.344 --> 17:06.912
Yeah. He married in college.
She got in an accident.

17:06.945 --> 17:08.847
Been in a coma 15 years.

17:08.881 --> 17:12.684
"Katie"... something.

17:12.718 --> 17:14.319
It's kind of tragic, really.

17:14.354 --> 17:16.387
So very tragic.

17:16.423 --> 17:18.424
So, um...

17:18.458 --> 17:21.160
did he mention any trouble yesterday?

17:21.194 --> 17:23.929
Or say anything about you having
something in your possession

17:23.963 --> 17:25.597
that he urgently needed?

17:25.631 --> 17:27.897
Something in the garage or house?

17:27.933 --> 17:29.300
Actually, yeah.

17:29.334 --> 17:31.936
He said he needed the laptop
I took from his apartment.

17:31.970 --> 17:34.004
Said he needed it right away.

17:34.039 --> 17:35.273
Did he say why?

17:35.307 --> 17:37.475
No, but since it's <i>my</i> laptop,

17:37.509 --> 17:39.277
I figured it was a line of bull,

17:39.311 --> 17:41.045
that he wanted me to give it up

17:41.080 --> 17:42.441
so he could sell it for the money.

17:42.448 --> 17:44.415
Given how anxious he was
to get his hands on it,

17:44.450 --> 17:46.451
it might have something to do
with his abduction.

17:46.485 --> 17:48.185
Tildy, could we borrow that laptop?

17:49.320 --> 17:51.088
Might help us find him.

17:51.122 --> 17:53.123
We are trained professionals,

17:53.157 --> 17:56.560
and Rogan might be in
some very, very serious trouble.

17:58.663 --> 18:01.065
He's in trouble, all right.

18:01.099 --> 18:02.866
I mean, all these years,
he knew that we were married.

18:02.901 --> 18:04.367
He knew when I got here.

18:04.402 --> 18:05.636
And for 15 years,

18:05.670 --> 18:07.805
he's been using that
as an excuse not to commit.

18:07.839 --> 18:08.939
Coma wife...

18:08.974 --> 18:10.807
It's kind of brilliant.

18:10.841 --> 18:12.842
You mean "despicable," right?

18:12.876 --> 18:15.145
Yeah. That's... what I meant.

18:15.179 --> 18:16.913
Did you find anything on the laptop?

18:16.947 --> 18:19.282
Their e-mails to each other
are fairly pornographic,

18:19.317 --> 18:21.284
but nothing
that would get a man abducted.

18:21.319 --> 18:22.719
You know what...
maybe we should call Tory

18:22.753 --> 18:25.233
and have her access it remotely,
see if we're missing anything.

18:25.256 --> 18:26.936
And we should re-check
Rogan's apartment...

18:26.957 --> 18:29.559
see if there's anything there that could
tell us what he was involved with.

18:29.594 --> 18:31.161
I got to call Lanie.

18:31.195 --> 18:33.830
I'm not gonna make my spa
bachelorette party this afternoon.

18:33.864 --> 18:35.904
You were gonna have naked ladies
at <i>your</i> party, too?

18:37.335 --> 18:38.935
Wow.

18:38.969 --> 18:40.937
Do what you need to do, girl.

18:40.971 --> 18:43.906
Operation Hamptons is in full swing,

18:43.941 --> 18:46.575
and we'll have a <i>newlyweds</i> spa day

18:46.610 --> 18:48.410
when you get back from your honeymoon.

18:48.445 --> 18:50.647
Yeah, Lanie, look, I don't know
when we're gonna get back,

18:50.681 --> 18:52.448
so can you go to my place,
pick up the dress,

18:52.482 --> 18:53.816
and take it up with you tonight?

18:53.851 --> 18:55.685
It will be there waiting for you.

18:55.719 --> 18:57.253
Okay, thanks, Lane.

18:58.756 --> 19:00.289
Assuming we get there at all.

19:01.491 --> 19:03.492
Are we crazy for going ahead with this?

19:03.527 --> 19:05.460
Yes. But what other choice do we have?

19:05.494 --> 19:07.996
Look, I don't want to have a makeup
wedding in a few months, okay?

19:08.031 --> 19:09.497
I want to do this <i>now.</i>

19:09.532 --> 19:12.200
So let's find this husband of
yours and get married tomorrow.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.670
Besides, not like
things can get any crazier.

19:14.702 --> 19:15.869
Yeah.

19:16.545 --> 19:19.310
Well. What do we have here?

19:22.112 --> 19:23.045
I spoke too soon.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.470
Where's Rogan?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.872
Okay, let's just relax
and put down the guns

19:34.907 --> 19:36.207
so no one gets hu...

19:36.242 --> 19:37.909
Castle?!

19:38.241 --> 19:39.946
See, the only ones getting hurt
are gonna be you

19:39.980 --> 19:41.313
if you don't tell me where Rogan's at.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.581
I'm fine.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.351
We don't know where he is.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.919
We barely know <i>who</i> he is.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.687
Then what are you doing in his place?!

19:48.721 --> 19:50.489
Looking for him... same as you.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.225
What's this?

19:53.260 --> 19:54.660
Is that you?

19:56.430 --> 19:57.829
That's a yes.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.333
Okay, well, according to this,
you and Rogan are married.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.035
Thought you didn't know the guy!

20:03.070 --> 20:04.703
Okay, well, funny story there.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.238
Is it still gonna be funny
when I make you bleed?

20:07.273 --> 20:08.674
No.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.909
Your husband owes me a lot of money.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.911
- Now, where is he?
- I don't know.

20:12.946 --> 20:15.581
All right, well,
seeing as how you're his wife,

20:15.615 --> 20:16.748
<i>you</i> can pay me.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.717
Uh, exactly how much does he owe you?

20:18.751 --> 20:21.887
Less his down payment,
$5,000 for services rendered.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.590
Payable <i>today.</i>

20:24.624 --> 20:26.925
What kind of services?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.860
That's between me and him.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.261
If you want me to pay you,

20:30.296 --> 20:33.599
then tell me what I'm paying for.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.667
All right. Well, that seems fair.

20:35.702 --> 20:40.371
Your husband hired us
to steal a phone last week.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.706
Whose phone?

20:41.740 --> 20:43.741
Uh, some girl named Sapphire...

20:43.775 --> 20:45.477
some stripper down at the roadhouse.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.513
$5,000 for a stripper's phone?
What was on it?

20:48.547 --> 20:50.148
I don't know. Didn't ask, don't care.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.516
I just want my money!

20:51.550 --> 20:53.684
And we'll get it to you. We just
need to find Rogan first.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.953
No, Mrs. O'Leary.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.688
I want my money <i>now.</i>

20:57.723 --> 20:59.690
Um, Castle, you wouldn't happen...

20:59.725 --> 21:01.192
Uh, well, my mother took
most of my cash,

21:01.227 --> 21:02.560
and Alexis has my ATM card.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.228
I don't suppose you'd take a check.

21:04.262 --> 21:06.263
That's... uh, uh, no, I got... I got...

21:06.297 --> 21:07.964
I have $500 right here.

21:07.999 --> 21:10.800
Ju... just for more time.

21:10.835 --> 21:12.603
We'll owe you the rest of the 5 grand.

21:12.637 --> 21:14.304
We just need a little bit more time.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.947
You bought yourself 12 hours.

21:25.216 --> 21:26.850
If you don't have the full
amount when I come back,

21:26.884 --> 21:28.385
I start breaking legs.

21:28.419 --> 21:30.521
Do you understand?

21:35.159 --> 21:36.425
Are you okay?

21:36.460 --> 21:38.628
No, Mrs. O'Leary, I'm not okay.

21:38.662 --> 21:40.729
I happen to like my legs...
and yours, too.

21:40.764 --> 21:44.066
And why is your husband
paying bikers over 5 grand

21:44.100 --> 21:45.401
for a stripper's phone?

21:45.435 --> 21:48.204
First of all, can we please stop
calling him my <i>husband?</i>

21:48.238 --> 21:50.339
And secondly, I don't know,
but I'm guessing

21:50.374 --> 21:52.408
it has something to do
with the abduction.

21:53.710 --> 21:55.344
Hey. It's Beckett.

21:55.379 --> 21:58.581
Yeah, I need you guys to set up
remote access to scrub a laptop.

21:58.615 --> 22:01.616
Castle, can you look up
the address to the roadhouse?

22:01.651 --> 22:04.018
I want to know what was
on that stripper's phone.

22:04.053 --> 22:07.422
Find a local strip bar?
Now, <i>that,</i> I know how to do.

22:07.456 --> 22:10.124
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:10.159 --> 22:11.459
No one stole my phone.

22:11.494 --> 22:12.460
Are you sure?

22:12.495 --> 22:14.162
Yeah. It's right here.

22:14.197 --> 22:15.664
See?

22:15.698 --> 22:17.399
Is there anything on it
that anyone might want?

22:17.433 --> 22:18.933
It's just a phone.

22:18.967 --> 22:21.102
What is this all about?

22:21.136 --> 22:23.205
Do you know a guy named Rogan O'Leary?

22:23.239 --> 22:25.139
Can't help you. Sorry.

22:25.174 --> 22:26.607
Wait, Sapphire, please.

22:26.641 --> 22:28.176
He may be in real trouble,

22:28.210 --> 22:30.712
so if you know something
that can help us find him...

22:30.746 --> 22:34.148
Look, if you don't want a dance,
then I need to move on.

22:39.621 --> 22:41.322
She knows something.

22:41.356 --> 22:43.191
Well, whatever it is, she doesn't
want to tell us.

22:43.225 --> 22:45.026
And I don't have
the jurisdiction to make her.

22:46.394 --> 22:47.461
Beckett.

22:47.495 --> 22:49.697
Kate, it's... it's me.

22:49.732 --> 22:51.665
Lanie?

22:51.700 --> 22:52.834
What's wrong?

22:52.868 --> 22:56.402
I went to your apartment
to pick up your dress,

22:56.437 --> 22:57.537
and...

22:57.571 --> 22:58.972
And what?

22:59.006 --> 23:00.874
Kate, a... a... a...

23:00.908 --> 23:03.844
a pipe burst
in the apartment above, and...

23:03.878 --> 23:05.445
Oh, no.

23:05.479 --> 23:07.080
No. Don't tell me.

23:07.115 --> 23:08.348
I tried, sweetie.

23:08.382 --> 23:09.983
I... I did everything that I could,

23:10.017 --> 23:11.885
but there was just too much damage.

23:11.919 --> 23:14.788
Kate...

23:14.822 --> 23:16.656
The dress...

23:18.559 --> 23:20.826
...it's gone!

23:24.598 --> 23:26.399
It's only a dress.
It's not the end of the world.

23:26.433 --> 23:28.401
Then why does it feel like it <i>is?</i>

23:28.435 --> 23:30.536
Our wedding was supposed to be magical.

23:30.571 --> 23:32.505
It was supposed to be our perfect day.

23:32.539 --> 23:34.440
And now it's just...

23:34.475 --> 23:37.009
falling apart.

23:37.043 --> 23:38.544
So we'll put it back together.

23:38.579 --> 23:41.046
Castle, I'm married to someone else.

23:41.081 --> 23:42.582
And I have no idea where he is.

23:42.616 --> 23:44.283
We don't have any leads.

23:44.317 --> 23:46.752
And to make things worse,
the venue, and then now this?

23:46.787 --> 23:52.391
I mean, it just feels like
all of this is one big sign.

23:52.425 --> 23:55.494
Well, maybe it <i>is</i> a sign.

23:55.528 --> 23:58.264
A sign that ours is a great love story.

23:58.298 --> 24:00.465
'Cause what's a great love story

24:00.500 --> 24:02.567
without obstacles to overcome?

24:02.602 --> 24:05.236
Every fairy tale has them...

24:05.271 --> 24:09.073
terrible trials that
only the worthy can transcend.

24:09.108 --> 24:12.243
But you can't give up.

24:12.278 --> 24:14.345
That's the deal.

24:14.379 --> 24:17.949
We want the happy ending,
we can't give up.

24:21.386 --> 24:23.421
And that's why I want to marry you.

24:32.864 --> 24:34.097
Beckett.

24:34.132 --> 24:35.399
Hey, it's Tory.

24:35.434 --> 24:37.368
I think I may have found something.

24:37.402 --> 24:39.770
I was scrubbing the laptop

24:39.805 --> 24:41.772
and came across a hidden folder.

24:41.807 --> 24:43.273
What's in it?

24:43.308 --> 24:44.442
Pictures.

24:44.476 --> 24:45.776
According to image data,

24:45.811 --> 24:47.945
they were recently downloaded
from someone's phone.

24:47.979 --> 24:51.248
Most of them are innocuous,
but there are a couple of them

24:51.282 --> 24:54.116
that, um... I think you need to see.

24:54.151 --> 24:55.852
I'm e-mailing them now.

24:58.989 --> 25:00.390
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

25:00.424 --> 25:01.758
- Oh-ho-ho!
- What?

25:01.792 --> 25:04.461
I think I know why
your scheming, scamming husband

25:04.495 --> 25:06.596
wanted to steal that stripper's phone.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.930
Check it out.

25:09.163 --> 25:11.043
It's a guy with a stripper.
What's the big deal?

25:11.068 --> 25:12.369
What's the big deal?

25:13.537 --> 25:15.337
<i>That</i> is the big deal.

25:15.372 --> 25:17.473
It's the local pastor.

25:17.507 --> 25:19.708
There's only one reason
your husband would pay that much

25:19.709 --> 25:20.976
to get these photos.

25:21.010 --> 25:22.811
He was blackmailing a man of God.

25:22.846 --> 25:25.013
A pastor with skin in the game.

25:25.047 --> 25:27.383
And motive to make Rogan disappear.

25:36.279 --> 25:38.047
Thank you for meeting with us, pastor.

25:38.081 --> 25:40.338
Well, you said on the phone
it was urgent,

25:40.375 --> 25:42.876
and helping people is my calling.

25:42.901 --> 25:44.879
Does that include helping people
out of their clothes

25:44.913 --> 25:46.614
while they're sitting on your lap?

25:48.316 --> 25:49.383
Where did you get those?

25:49.417 --> 25:51.485
I think you already know
the answer to that.

25:51.519 --> 25:53.387
I suppose you want money, too.

25:53.421 --> 25:56.090
I am a pastor, not a bank!

25:56.124 --> 25:57.691
We're not here to blackmail you.

25:58.927 --> 26:00.361
You're not?

26:00.395 --> 26:02.897
It started six months ago.

26:02.931 --> 26:04.164
I had...

26:04.199 --> 26:06.533
a moment of weakness.

26:06.567 --> 26:09.203
That stripper got photos of me.

26:09.237 --> 26:10.871
It's been a nightmare ever since.

26:10.906 --> 26:13.407
$1,000 here, $500 there.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.675
So, <i>Sapphire</i> was
blackmailing you, not Rogan?

26:15.710 --> 26:18.212
At first. Then Rogan must've found out.

26:18.246 --> 26:20.746
He got his hands on the photos somehow.

26:20.781 --> 26:23.049
He said if I gave him $25,000,

26:23.083 --> 26:25.785
he would make them disappear forever.

26:25.819 --> 26:27.620
And if I didn't,

26:27.654 --> 26:30.223
he would release them
to the <i>Willow Creek Register.</i>

26:30.257 --> 26:32.625
So, is that why you kidnapped
him? To get those photos back?

26:32.659 --> 26:33.626
What?!

26:33.660 --> 26:36.629
I didn't kidnap him!

26:36.663 --> 26:38.564
What kind of a man do you think I am?!

26:38.598 --> 26:40.133
Well, I think we have
a pretty good picture.

26:40.167 --> 26:41.567
We have a <i>few</i> pictures, actually.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.169
No, I was going to pay him.

26:43.203 --> 26:44.737
I swear. Look.

26:44.771 --> 26:49.242
I was supposed to meet him here
this morning with the money.

26:49.276 --> 26:53.512
He was going to hand over
the laptop and the photos,

26:53.547 --> 26:56.181
but he never showed.

26:57.984 --> 27:01.887
Uh, be right with you, Mrs. Monroe.

27:01.922 --> 27:04.657
So, you have no idea where Rogan
is or who might've taken him?

27:04.691 --> 27:05.958
No.

27:05.992 --> 27:09.862
But if you find him,
tell him I am ready to pay.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.732
I just want this to end.

27:13.767 --> 27:16.969
Thank you for waiting, Mrs. Monroe.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.404
So, your husband is hijacking
someone else's blackmail?

27:19.439 --> 27:22.807
Kind of ingenious,
in a... degenerate sort of way.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.209
Not if you're Sapphire.

27:24.243 --> 27:25.610
If you're Sapphire,

27:25.644 --> 27:27.712
you're pissed that you lost
your income stream,

27:27.746 --> 27:29.814
and you want those photos back.

27:30.984 --> 27:32.817
I'm sorry, but Sapphire's gone.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.354
She bolted right after
she talked to you guys.

27:35.388 --> 27:37.155
Bitch stuck me with her shift.

27:37.190 --> 27:39.624
Uh, do you know where we could find her?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.693
Uh, you could try her boyfriend's place.

27:41.727 --> 27:43.795
They sort of live together.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.497
His name's Jimmy Lutz.

27:45.531 --> 27:48.099
He's got a farm off Route 183.

27:50.769 --> 27:52.604
We really should tip.

28:01.514 --> 28:03.515
There it is.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.117
That's the truck...

28:07.151 --> 28:10.220
the one that took Rogan.

28:10.254 --> 28:11.354
Here.

28:20.598 --> 28:23.266
Check out the barn.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.838
Looks like we found our kidnappers.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.372
Then we should call the police.

28:29.407 --> 28:31.140
- And tell them what?
- That they have guns.

28:31.174 --> 28:35.210
On their own property, which is
their constitutional right.

28:35.245 --> 28:38.213
We don't have proof
that they have Rogan.

28:40.250 --> 28:41.216
Yet.

28:41.251 --> 28:43.152
"Yet"? What do you mean, "yet"?

28:43.186 --> 28:45.120
Come on, Castle.

28:45.155 --> 28:47.222
Let's see if that's
where they're keeping him.

28:49.059 --> 28:51.393
Do you want to get married
tomorrow or not?

28:54.565 --> 28:55.864
What if we get caught?

28:55.898 --> 28:58.266
We tell them
we're tourists from the city.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.701
We got lost.

28:59.735 --> 29:01.736
Yes. That worked out really well
in "Deliverance."

29:01.771 --> 29:03.572
Okay, let's start with that barn.

29:13.549 --> 29:15.549
Place looks like the start
of an amish horror film.

29:15.551 --> 29:17.052
Shhh.

29:22.157 --> 29:23.657
Castle.

29:26.995 --> 29:29.697
Rogan?

29:29.731 --> 29:31.699
Is that you?

29:39.308 --> 29:42.076
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

29:42.111 --> 29:43.811
I was not expecting that.

29:48.182 --> 29:50.883
Rogan!

29:50.918 --> 29:52.552
Oh, my God.

29:54.422 --> 29:57.524
Oh, my God. Dude,
you should've heard yourself.

29:57.558 --> 29:59.292
"Oh! Aah!"

30:01.962 --> 30:03.330
Kit Kat, who is this guy?

30:03.364 --> 30:04.664
"Kit Kat"?

30:04.698 --> 30:08.768
This guy is Richard Castle,
my <i>future</i> husband.

30:08.802 --> 30:09.802
Really?

30:09.837 --> 30:11.404
Well, after his little scream,

30:11.439 --> 30:13.573
you may want to, uh,
re-check his man parts.

30:13.608 --> 30:16.009
My man parts are just fine,
thank you very much.

30:16.043 --> 30:17.744
Could everyone please
stop saying "man parts"?

30:17.778 --> 30:18.911
So, how did you find me?

30:18.946 --> 30:20.013
Well, we just followed the trail

30:20.047 --> 30:21.147
of disappointment and deception...

30:21.181 --> 30:22.314
led us right to you.

30:22.349 --> 30:24.183
Oh, wow.
You're engaged to a douche.

30:24.217 --> 30:26.786
Here... why don't you untie me
so we can get out of here?

30:26.820 --> 30:28.254
Fine.

30:29.623 --> 30:31.357
<i>You're</i> a douche.

30:32.392 --> 30:33.459
There.

30:35.228 --> 30:36.763
W... what are you... what are you doing?

30:36.797 --> 30:38.131
Freeing up one hand.

30:38.165 --> 30:40.499
That's all you need to sign <i>this.</i>

30:40.534 --> 30:42.669
Good one, Kit Kat.

30:42.703 --> 30:44.303
That's... hilarious.

30:44.337 --> 30:45.837
I'm not joking.

30:45.872 --> 30:47.839
If you want me to cut you loose,
then sign the papers.

30:47.874 --> 30:50.075
I'll sign the papers
when we're out of here.

30:50.109 --> 30:51.610
Sign them <i>now.</i>

30:51.645 --> 30:53.078
What? You don't trust me?

30:53.112 --> 30:55.714
In fairness, you did blackmail a pastor.

30:55.748 --> 30:57.416
Wait, wait, wait. Just hold on.

30:57.450 --> 30:59.385
Don't you want to hear my side of it?

30:59.419 --> 31:01.019
I don't care about your side!

31:01.054 --> 31:04.122
I just want you to sign these papers.

31:04.157 --> 31:05.691
You know, maybe we <i>should</i>
wait to do this

31:05.725 --> 31:07.125
till we get somewhere safe.

31:07.160 --> 31:10.396
Yes. Listen to man parts.
Let's get the hell out of here.

31:10.430 --> 31:12.664
So you can disappear again?
Or get kidnapped? No.

31:12.698 --> 31:14.799
Just sign these papers right now
on the dotted line.

31:14.833 --> 31:16.133
Whoa. You don't understand.

31:16.168 --> 31:17.735
Those guys are gonna kill me.

31:17.769 --> 31:18.903
Over blackmail photos?

31:18.937 --> 31:20.805
They're not gonna kill you, Rogan.

31:20.839 --> 31:22.873
Though, if you think about it,
that would solve our problem.

31:22.908 --> 31:24.576
Listen, this isn't
about the pastor, okay?

31:24.610 --> 31:27.712
T... there were other photos
on t... that stripper's phone...

31:27.746 --> 31:29.814
photos that had something to do
with her boyfriend.

31:29.848 --> 31:31.082
Jimmy Lutz?

31:31.116 --> 31:33.050
Yeah, but I... I don't think
that's his real name.

31:33.085 --> 31:34.652
I mean, t... the ugly brothers...

31:34.687 --> 31:36.854
they... they always, uh,
called him something else,

31:36.888 --> 31:39.224
like... Barbozza something.

31:39.258 --> 31:41.226
Wait... Barbozza?

31:42.794 --> 31:43.993
Yeah.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.596
You mean, like <i>Mickey</i> Barbozza?

31:45.630 --> 31:47.163
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

31:47.198 --> 31:48.898
I mean, this guy wants
those pictures something fierce,

31:48.933 --> 31:50.534
but I wouldn't tell him where they are

31:50.568 --> 31:52.402
'cause I didn't want him
going after Tildy.

31:52.437 --> 31:54.605
I... I'm sorry... are we talking
about Mickey Barbozza,

31:54.639 --> 31:56.906
the mob hit man who disappeared
about a decade...

31:56.941 --> 31:59.175
oh, yes. Yeah, that's him.
That's the guy.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.577
Castle, help me untie him.
We got to get out of here.

32:00.612 --> 32:03.447
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So, h... how bad is this guy?

32:03.481 --> 32:06.483
He eluded a massive manhunt
by killing half a dozen people,

32:06.517 --> 32:08.585
and the FBI's been
looking for him ever since.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.887
And, so, wh...
he's been hiding out up here?

32:10.921 --> 32:12.889
Yeah. Congratulations, Rogan.

32:12.923 --> 32:16.259
You accidentally stole photos
of a fugitive mobster.

32:16.293 --> 32:17.660
Okay, but that was not my intent.

32:18.762 --> 32:20.829
Come on. Let's go.

32:27.437 --> 32:30.627
Is it just me,
or are we completely screwed?

32:39.760 --> 32:42.429
Oh, come on, Richard. Pick up.

32:42.464 --> 32:43.597
Still no word?

32:43.631 --> 32:45.298
No, not for hours.

32:45.332 --> 32:46.631
It's beautiful, isn't it?

32:46.663 --> 32:47.796
It's perfect.

32:47.831 --> 32:50.433
I can't believe Alexis
and Martha pulled this off.

32:50.467 --> 32:52.535
Now all we need is a bride and groom.

32:52.569 --> 32:54.670
The wedding's less than 24 hours away.

32:54.704 --> 32:56.839
I hope they make it.

33:02.979 --> 33:05.047
Tell me this is
still part of the fairy tale.

33:05.081 --> 33:06.715
If it is, it's a grimm one.

33:08.051 --> 33:09.685
What do you... what do you think
they're gonna do?

33:09.719 --> 33:11.787
My guess...

33:11.821 --> 33:14.523
once they recover the photos,
they'll probably kill us.

33:14.557 --> 33:17.259
Yes, making this
the worst bachelor party ever!

33:17.293 --> 33:18.593
Don't look at <i>me.</i>

33:18.628 --> 33:19.928
Okay, we would've been out of there

33:19.963 --> 33:22.464
if she hadn't gotten all
stubborn and just cut me loose.

33:22.498 --> 33:25.600
You could've just signed
those papers and cut <i>me</i> loose.

33:25.635 --> 33:26.902
Hey, believe it or not,

33:26.936 --> 33:28.971
I was just trying to do
the right thing for Tildy.

33:29.005 --> 33:30.673
By blackmailing a pastor?

33:30.707 --> 33:32.808
Oh, please.
Don't let the collar fool you.

33:32.842 --> 33:34.309
That guy had it coming.

33:34.343 --> 33:37.612
Really?! The pastor had it coming?

33:37.647 --> 33:39.948
He told me about
this investment opportunity

33:39.983 --> 33:41.448
where I could double my money.

33:41.483 --> 33:45.519
Only... I didn't have any money,
so I borrowed Tildy's.

33:45.554 --> 33:47.989
Well, guess what. It was a scam.

33:48.023 --> 33:49.991
The guy was rooking me
to pay off the stripper.

33:50.025 --> 33:52.393
I mean, how many
broken commandments is that?

33:52.427 --> 33:54.829
So I took matters
into my own hands, you know?

33:54.863 --> 33:57.331
And it was a...
it was a damn fine plan, too.

34:00.135 --> 34:02.737
Except the...

34:02.771 --> 34:04.939
Murderous mobster part.

34:04.973 --> 34:07.075
I really didn't see that coming.

34:07.109 --> 34:08.176
This isn't over.

34:08.210 --> 34:09.844
We're gonna get out of this.
There's a way.

34:09.878 --> 34:11.745
Love to hear it.

34:11.779 --> 34:14.481
So, the thief has a wife.

34:14.516 --> 34:15.982
That's good.

34:16.016 --> 34:18.585
That makes this all a lot easier.

34:18.620 --> 34:21.154
Where are those photos?

34:21.188 --> 34:23.857
I... I... I told you... I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:23.891 --> 34:25.192
Well, guess what.

34:25.226 --> 34:27.928
I can incentivize you.

34:27.962 --> 34:29.362
Where are the photos?

34:29.397 --> 34:30.697
Okay, look, I...

34:30.732 --> 34:33.601
I... I deleted them. They're gone.

34:33.635 --> 34:34.801
I swear.

34:34.835 --> 34:36.370
I don't believe you.

34:36.404 --> 34:38.170
I'm gonna count to three.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.273
You don't tell me where they are,

34:40.306 --> 34:42.208
you're not gonna need
these court papers.

34:42.243 --> 34:44.377
I'll end your marriage for you.

34:44.411 --> 34:46.478
One...

34:46.513 --> 34:47.679
Two...

34:47.715 --> 34:49.047
I know. I...

34:49.081 --> 34:50.449
I know where they are.

34:50.484 --> 34:52.051
I...

34:52.085 --> 34:53.518
I know where they are.

34:53.554 --> 34:56.922
They're on a laptop... at his place.

34:56.956 --> 34:58.858
She and I can take you to them.

35:00.694 --> 35:01.861
Yeah.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.401
All right.

35:08.435 --> 35:10.502
Why don't we <i>all</i> go?

35:12.372 --> 35:14.539
So, why are they taking all of us?

35:14.574 --> 35:16.074
Why do you think?

35:16.108 --> 35:19.411
Husband, wife, future husband,
your apartment.

35:19.445 --> 35:21.413
When they find our dead bodies,

35:21.447 --> 35:23.882
the story of jealous rage writes itself.

35:25.851 --> 35:27.952
Open the door.

35:27.987 --> 35:30.255
Mickey, trust me...
you don't want to do this.

35:30.290 --> 35:32.624
Trust me... I <i>do.</i>

35:42.401 --> 35:44.234
Okay. Where's the laptop?

35:44.269 --> 35:45.670
No.

35:47.238 --> 35:48.739
Where's my money?

35:48.774 --> 35:51.208
What the hell is going on here?

35:51.242 --> 35:52.610
You want your money? It's right there.

35:52.644 --> 35:56.347
This is Mickey Barbozza.
He's wanted by the FBI.

35:56.381 --> 35:58.516
So?

35:58.550 --> 36:00.284
So, there's a reward for his capture...

36:00.319 --> 36:01.852
$100,000.

36:01.886 --> 36:04.587
You take him in, it's all yours.

36:24.542 --> 36:26.543
Let's go, tough guy.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.982
That was a hell
of an angle you guys played.

36:35.685 --> 36:38.487
I guess, uh,
I should be thanking you both

36:38.521 --> 36:40.723
for... saving my ass.

36:40.757 --> 36:43.425
Don't forget the contribution
of the homicidal bikers.

36:43.460 --> 36:47.095
Yeah, so, um, maybe you could sign...

36:47.129 --> 36:48.831
the papers now.

36:48.865 --> 36:51.066
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.637
Okay.

36:59.709 --> 37:01.977
You know, Kit Kat...

37:02.011 --> 37:05.313
I don't want you to be sad
about this, okay?

37:05.348 --> 37:07.282
'Cause you're better off without me.

37:07.316 --> 37:08.649
Just sign the papers.

37:09.852 --> 37:11.119
Okay.

37:15.657 --> 37:17.658
There you go!

37:18.928 --> 37:21.596
You are a lucky man, man parts.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.932
I, uh...

37:23.966 --> 37:26.101
I just wish I had what you guys have.

37:26.135 --> 37:28.937
Well, maybe you already do.

37:28.971 --> 37:30.538
With Tildy?

37:30.572 --> 37:32.607
Uh... I don't know, man.

37:32.641 --> 37:34.441
I... I screwed that up.

37:34.475 --> 37:35.943
You know, I mean, a... after all this,

37:35.977 --> 37:37.378
I didn't even get her money back,

37:37.412 --> 37:40.480
and she's gonna lose the bar
because of me.

37:40.515 --> 37:42.383
Not necessarily.

37:42.417 --> 37:43.850
From pastor Bob.

37:43.885 --> 37:45.152
What?

37:45.186 --> 37:48.622
A $25,000 apology for scamming
that money from you.

37:48.656 --> 37:52.927
He says if he never sees you
or those photos again,

37:52.961 --> 37:54.128
you're even.

37:54.162 --> 37:55.129
Oh, my God.

37:55.163 --> 37:56.696
Rogan, what the hell?

37:56.731 --> 38:00.834
I told you I never wanted
to see you in here again!

38:00.868 --> 38:02.602
Tildy, Tildy, wait. Just...

38:04.739 --> 38:06.339
I got some bad news.

38:06.373 --> 38:10.043
My wife that was in a coma...

38:11.045 --> 38:12.579
...she died.

38:12.613 --> 38:13.713
Oh, my God.

38:13.748 --> 38:14.815
Yeah.

38:14.849 --> 38:16.349
Oh, I'm so sorry.

38:16.383 --> 38:18.919
Don't be. She's in a much better place.

38:18.953 --> 38:21.822
She...
she left me some money,

38:21.856 --> 38:25.391
and I... I just...
I want to give it to you.

38:25.426 --> 38:27.360
I...

38:27.394 --> 38:28.662
I love you, Tildy.

38:29.764 --> 38:31.197
I love you, too.

38:36.369 --> 38:37.937
Oh.

38:37.971 --> 38:39.371
Come with me.

38:42.943 --> 38:45.711
I can't believe you gave him
the money from pastor Bob.

38:45.745 --> 38:47.379
I'm a sucker for happy endings.

38:47.413 --> 38:49.949
Let's get the hell out
of this town and go get our own.

38:49.983 --> 38:51.917
Yes!

38:51.952 --> 38:53.953
We're getting married!

39:03.062 --> 39:05.897
People are starting to arrive.
Are you ready?

39:05.931 --> 39:07.632
Almost.

39:07.666 --> 39:09.634
How did you pull this off?

39:09.668 --> 39:11.370
Oh, you know, I called your dad.

39:11.404 --> 39:13.405
He said he had a dress you could wear.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.241
Wow!

39:16.275 --> 39:19.311
You look like an angel.

39:19.345 --> 39:21.278
Really?

39:21.313 --> 39:23.781
Yeah. For a second there,
<i>I</i> wanted to marry you.

39:23.816 --> 39:25.750
Oh, just stop, Lanie.

39:25.784 --> 39:29.754
I must say, your mother had great taste.

39:29.788 --> 39:31.890
Yes, she did.

39:31.924 --> 39:32.991
Look at you.

39:33.025 --> 39:36.160
I believe you are
the most beautiful bride

39:36.194 --> 39:37.495
I have ever seen.

39:37.530 --> 39:39.296
Thank you, Martha.

39:39.331 --> 39:41.799
Lanie, darling, could you just
give us a minute?

39:41.834 --> 39:44.801
Sure. I'll just tell your dad
that it's perfect!

39:44.836 --> 39:46.270
Thanks, Lanie.

39:46.304 --> 39:48.105
Martha, I... I just wanted to tell you

39:48.140 --> 39:50.774
how grateful I am
to you and Alexis for...

39:50.808 --> 39:53.344
for putting all of this together.

39:53.378 --> 39:58.282
And I want to thank you
for making my son so very happy.

39:58.316 --> 39:59.750
I brought you something...

39:59.784 --> 40:02.920
in case you didn't have something blue.

40:05.822 --> 40:07.123
Oh, wow.

40:07.158 --> 40:10.260
They're... beautiful.

40:10.294 --> 40:13.663
They were given to me by my mother

40:13.697 --> 40:15.665
to wear on my wedding day,

40:15.699 --> 40:18.535
and by her mother before.

40:18.569 --> 40:22.272
Only women of substance
have worn these gems.

40:22.306 --> 40:25.908
They've been waiting,
Katherine, for <i>you.</i>

40:30.380 --> 40:31.880
I'm so honored, Martha.

40:31.914 --> 40:32.914
Thank you.

40:32.949 --> 40:34.849
Oh, darling, they're exquisite on you.

40:35.885 --> 40:37.419
Oh, excuse me.

40:40.190 --> 40:41.290
Aah! It's him.

40:41.324 --> 40:44.193
Oh. Well, I will leave you
to talk to your groom.

40:44.227 --> 40:46.061
I'll be outside.

40:49.299 --> 40:51.265
Hey, lover. How close are you?

40:51.300 --> 40:52.733
20 minutes.

40:52.767 --> 40:54.835
And you'll be happy to know things
went smoothly with the judge.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.170
You are a free woman.

40:56.205 --> 40:57.171
Ohh!

40:57.206 --> 40:58.306
But not for long.

40:58.340 --> 41:00.408
I got our marriage license in my pocket.

41:00.442 --> 41:02.610
I will be there soon.

41:02.644 --> 41:03.711
And, Kate...

41:03.745 --> 41:05.313
Yeah?

41:05.347 --> 41:06.714
I love you.

41:06.748 --> 41:08.149
I love you, too.

41:41.615 --> 41:43.081
It's been an hour already,

41:43.116 --> 41:45.017
and the natives down there
are getting restless.

41:45.051 --> 41:46.318
Where do you think he is?

41:46.353 --> 41:47.319
I don't know.

41:47.354 --> 41:48.454
When I spoke to him last,

41:48.488 --> 41:50.389
he said he was
less than 20 minutes away.

41:51.958 --> 41:53.925
<i>This is Richard Castle.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

41:55.328 --> 41:56.762
Straight to voice-mail.

42:02.802 --> 42:03.902
Hello?

42:05.471 --> 42:07.605
Yes. This is she.
