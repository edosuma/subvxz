And vice versa.

01:12.822 --> 01:15.575
Just remember, Bart,
convicts aren't cool.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.035
They're bad people.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.370

<i>after I tried to frame you</i>
<i>for armed robbery,</i>

01:38.098 --> 01:40.308
<i>I tried to murder</i>
<i>Selma Bouvier.</i>

01:40.391 --> 01:42.811
<i>Let's see-- I rigged</i>
<i>the mayoral elections,</i>

01:42.894 --> 01:45.563
<i>I tried to blow up Springfield</i>
<i>with a nuclear device,</i>

01:45.647 --> 01:46.940
<i>and I tried to kill you.</i>

01:47.023 --> 01:48.566
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>

01:48.650 --> 01:50.026
<i>And whenever I could find</i>
<i>a spare moment,</i>

01:50.110 --> 01:51.611
<i>I've tried to murder.</i>

01:51.694 --> 01:52.737
<i>Bart Simpson.</i>

01:52.821 --> 01:53.822
(yelling)

01:56.616 --> 01:59.953
He said, "tried."

02:00.036 --> 02:00.995
Someone should
really go up there

02:01.079 --> 02:03.957
and talk to him.

02:04.040 --> 02:04.999
(sighs)

02:05.083 --> 02:06.167
Whew.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.961
Homer!

02:08.044 --> 02:12.215
Oh,
all those stairs...

02:12.298 --> 02:15.969
Oh, you have nothing
to worry about, honey.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.428
Your mother's right,
Bart.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.389
Sure, you're the one
who ruined

02:19.472 --> 02:21.724
all of Sideshow Bob's
criminal schemes--

02:21.808 --> 02:23.601
We're very proud
of you, by the way.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.980
And sure, he's probably
so insane with rage

02:27.063 --> 02:29.315
that he'd butcher you
horribly if he could.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.734
But he's
safely locked away.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.570
In a medium-security prison.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.779
-For life.
-Unless he gets out somehow.

02:34.863 --> 02:35.947
Which is impossible.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.615
Or so you think,

02:37.699 --> 02:39.784
except he's done it
so many times before.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.202
Thanks for trying, guys,

02:41.286 --> 02:43.496
but Sideshow Bob
wants me dead,

02:43.580 --> 02:44.789
and Sideshow Bob

02:44.873 --> 02:47.667
is an unstoppable
killing machine.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.607
(all grumbling)

03:10.690 --> 03:12.358
Now, really, Reverend,

03:12.442 --> 03:14.402
your praise is going
to get me beaten up.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.154
Oh, I'm sorry, Bob,

03:16.237 --> 03:18.823
but your transformation
is truly inspiring.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.158
Yes.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.869
I'm a good, good man.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.496
You know, it's hard to believe
this model prisoner

03:25.580 --> 03:26.873
could be the same
monstrous fiend

03:26.956 --> 03:28.875
who once ran for mayor.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.044
It's a pleasure
to have recommended you

03:31.127 --> 03:32.837
for the work-release
program.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.882
Me? I'm touched.
I really am.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.009
But you'll never find
anyone willing to hire

03:38.092 --> 03:40.345
a five-time loser like me.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.013
I already have.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.645
Cecil?

03:48.728 --> 03:50.104
Is it really you?

03:50.188 --> 03:51.397
Hello, brother.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.565
I'm happy to see you.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.027
But it's been ten years.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.780
We haven't spoken
since the...

03:58.863 --> 04:00.073
unpleasantness.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.407
You mean
Arthur Fiedler's wake?

04:01.491 --> 04:04.035
No, no, no.
I mean our falling out.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.036
Oh, that.

04:05.119 --> 04:06.996
That's ancient history.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.456
Let's make a fresh start.

04:08.539 --> 04:09.832
Come work for me.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.043
But this is wonderful.

04:12.126 --> 04:14.295
You do know
I used to have a--

04:14.379 --> 04:15.630
(clears throat)

04:15.713 --> 04:17.924
problem with trying
to kill people?

04:18.007 --> 04:19.968
Goodness, I had no idea.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.178
For, you see, I have been
on Mars for the last decade

04:22.262 --> 04:25.890
in a cave with my eyes shut
and my fingers in my ears.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.308
Touché, Cecil.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.310
I'm aware
of your felonious past,

04:29.394 --> 04:31.437
but you are
still my brother,

04:31.521 --> 04:33.731
and blood is thicker
than bread and water.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.984
You don't have to worry
about me, brother.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.944
I'm all murdered out.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.570
Praise the Lord.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.957
(booing and yelling)

04:51.040 --> 04:53.167
Get back in there!
Get back in there!

04:53.251 --> 04:56.504
How can you even think
of releasing Sideshow Bob?

04:56.587 --> 04:58.673
He's just faking it
to get out of jail.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.133
He's a maniac!

05:00.216 --> 05:01.968
Bob is no maniac.

05:02.051 --> 05:05.138
He explained his reasons
for trying to kill us all.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.849
And I assure you,
they were perfectly sane.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.600
Oh, you gotta be kidding!

05:09.684 --> 05:11.853
My friends, please.

05:11.936 --> 05:14.314
I make no secret
of my past.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.357
But isn't our system
of justice

05:16.441 --> 05:19.027
based on the idea
that a man can change?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.737
Have the boys
check into that.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.196
I know I don't deserve
another chance,

05:22.280 --> 05:24.198
but this is America.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.201
And as an American,
aren't I entitled to one?

05:27.285 --> 05:28.286
MAN: Probably!

05:28.369 --> 05:30.121
Can't you find it in your hearts

05:30.204 --> 05:32.999
just to let me
live and work in peace?

05:33.082 --> 05:34.250
(all agreeing)

05:45.094 --> 05:46.220
Don't you see
what you've done?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.014
Sideshow Bob hasn't reformed.

05:48.097 --> 05:49.474
He's pure evil!

05:49.557 --> 05:51.934
Oh, if only you knew
what he was thinking.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.860
<i>I hope they still make</i>
<i>that shampoo I like.</i>

06:10.036 --> 06:11.829
Now, make yourself
at home.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.748
Perhaps a glass
of Bordeaux?

06:13.831 --> 06:15.208
I have the '82
Chateau Latour

06:15.291 --> 06:17.835
and a rather indifferent
Rausan-Segla.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.629
I've been in prison,
Cecil.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.297
I'll be happy just as long
as it doesn't taste

06:21.381 --> 06:23.883
like orange drink
fermented under a radiator.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.594
That would be
the Latour, then.

06:26.677 --> 06:30.598
And God bless Mom and Dad
and Lisa and Maggie

06:30.681 --> 06:33.142
and, please, God,
kill Sideshow Bob.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.352
Bart, no!

06:34.435 --> 06:35.686
It's him or me, o, Lord.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.105
-(grunting)
-Ow!

06:37.188 --> 06:39.732
You can't ask God
to kill someone.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.485
Yeah! You do
your own dirty work.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.451
Well, I suppose I should
ask you what you do

06:50.535 --> 06:51.953
if I'm to be
working with you.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.122
For me, Bob. For me.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.873
I am Springfield's

06:55.957 --> 06:58.292
chief hydrological
and hydrodynamical engineer.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.253
Hydrological
and hydrodynamical--

07:00.336 --> 07:02.255
talk about
running the gamut.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.048
Snigger all you like, Bob.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.967
Thank you.
I believe I shall.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.969
But you'll find
one gets more respect

07:08.052 --> 07:10.721
as a humble civil servant
than as a homicidal maniac

07:10.805 --> 07:12.056
or a clown's sidekick.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.517
Aha! I knew it.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.103
You're still angry that
Krusty picked me instead of you.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.438
I can't imagine
what you mean.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.440
Oh, come now.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.151
You wanted to be Krusty 's
sidekick since you were five!

07:23.234 --> 07:27.989
What about the buffoon lessons,
the four years at clown college?

07:28.072 --> 07:30.324
I'll thank you not to refer
to Princeton that way.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.285
The point is you obviously
still blame me

07:32.368 --> 07:34.203
for what happened
at your audition.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.373
(whimpering)

07:40.668 --> 07:42.587
Thanks for driving me,
big brother.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.964
These giant clown mitts
are extremely hilarious,

07:45.047 --> 07:47.008
but do make it
difficult to shift gears.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.010
That's the title of Erma Bombeck's
latest, isn't it?

07:49.093 --> 07:50.470
KRUSTY: Number 73!

07:50.553 --> 07:52.597
You're next.
Make with the laugh-laugh.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.681
(drum roll, rim shot)

07:53.764 --> 07:55.349
(clearing throat)

07:55.433 --> 07:56.684
(meekly)
Hey, children.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.437
Meet me, Sideshow Cecil.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.606
KRUSTY (imitating buzzer):
Next.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.192
Uh, I have prepared
a pie-in-the-face take.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.027
(groaning)

08:06.110 --> 08:07.820
All right.
Knock yourself out, kid.

08:07.904 --> 08:08.821
Hal?

08:10.114 --> 08:12.116
Ooh.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.951
Free comedy tip, slick:

08:14.035 --> 08:17.622
The pie gag's only funny
when the sap's got dignity,

08:17.705 --> 08:19.373
like that guy.

08:19.457 --> 08:22.210
Hey, Hal, pie job for
Lord Autumnbottom there.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.421
Oh, dear.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.423
(laughing)

08:27.507 --> 08:29.258
(applause, laughter)

08:30.593 --> 08:32.303
That guy's a genius!

08:32.386 --> 08:33.596
He's gonna change the way

08:33.679 --> 08:35.765
we think about
getting hit by pies!

08:35.848 --> 08:38.226
Chumley, you're hired.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.313
When that pie hit your face,

08:42.396 --> 08:45.900
I saw my dreams explode
in a burst of cream and crust.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.360
But I suppose
I should thank you.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.612
After all,
it led me to my true calling.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.490
Cecil, no civilization
in history

08:52.573 --> 08:54.617
has ever considered
chief hydrological engineer

08:54.700 --> 08:56.118
a calling.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.411
(clearing throat)

08:57.495 --> 08:59.830
Yes, yes. The Cappadocians.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.165
Fine.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.627
CECIL: There it is--
the future site

09:04.710 --> 09:07.630
of the Springfield
hydroelectric dam.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.966
Just the thought of all
that raw, surging power

09:10.049 --> 09:11.634
makes me wonder why the hell
I should care.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.845
Because you'll be supervising
the construction crew.

09:14.929 --> 09:15.972
Oh, great.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.557
Whenever a woman
passes by,

09:17.640 --> 09:19.100
I suppose it will be my job
to lead the hooting.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.852
"Oh, yeah!
Shake it, madam.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.020
Capital knockers!"

09:23.104 --> 09:24.647
Come on, Bob.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.399
This is your chance to show
the people of Springfield

09:26.482 --> 09:28.734
you can hold down
an honest job.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.028
He's planning something evil--
I know it.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.614
It must have something to do
with the town's water supply.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.449
Maybe he's gonna pee
in the river!

09:35.533 --> 09:37.743
Mmm. Nah.
That's not his style.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.247
Who is that?

09:41.330 --> 09:43.249
(gasps)
Why...

09:43.332 --> 09:44.834
it's Bart Simpson!

09:44.917 --> 09:47.587
Hello, Bart!

09:47.670 --> 09:50.172
He's just a little shy because
I've tried to kill him so many times.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.173
Oh.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.010
I really must thank you

09:54.093 --> 09:56.679
for this moment
of tranquility, Edna.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.806
You know, I haven't been
on a date in six years.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.725
Oh, the pleasure's
mine, Bob.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.060
It's so exciting
to be dating a killer.

10:03.144 --> 10:06.314
To be fair, I never
successfully killed anyone.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.566
Oh. I see.

10:11.068 --> 10:15.281
I did once try to kill
the world's greatest lover,

10:15.364 --> 10:19.076
but then, I realized there are
laws against suicide.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.412
(giggling)

10:21.495 --> 10:23.456
-You get my drift?
-Oh, you.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.500
Mrs. Krabappel, no!
That's Sideshow Bob!

10:26.584 --> 10:28.377
Well,
that's the last time

10:28.461 --> 10:30.796
I announce my dinner
plans in class.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.008
That was Edna Krabappel.

10:34.091 --> 10:37.637
You only get one chance
with Edna Krabappel.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.388
I hope you're happy.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.556
I won't be happy
until I find out

10:40.640 --> 10:41.891
what you're up to.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.101
Wherever you go
and whatever you do,

10:44.185 --> 10:46.854
I'll be there
watching and waiting.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.899
He says that, but I bet
he gives up pretty quickly.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.988
Hello, brother.
All's well, I trust?

10:56.072 --> 10:58.366
It most certainly is not!

10:58.449 --> 10:59.700
The workmen you've given me
don't know their asses

10:59.784 --> 11:00.993
from the hole in the ground

11:01.077 --> 11:02.328
they accidentally
blew yesterday.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.205
Come now, you speak as if
they were a gaggle

11:04.288 --> 11:06.165
of slack-jawed yokels.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.334
Mr. Terwilliger,
come quick!

11:08.417 --> 11:11.754
There's trouble down to
the "see-ment" mixer, sir!

11:11.837 --> 11:13.839
See, cousin Merl
and me

11:13.923 --> 11:16.133
was playin' fetch
with Geech--

11:16.217 --> 11:18.469
that's our old
smellhound-- and--

11:18.552 --> 11:21.764
Geech gone to heaven,
Mr. Terwilliger.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.934
Oh, cousin Merl, really!

11:25.017 --> 11:26.560
Temper, temper.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.646
You know cousin Merl
ain't been quite right lately.

11:28.729 --> 11:29.980
I'm telling you, Cecil,

11:30.064 --> 11:31.524
I can't take
much more of this--

11:31.607 --> 11:33.484
rustic workmen who've
turned the Sanijohn

11:33.567 --> 11:35.027
into a smokehouse...

11:35.111 --> 11:38.823
coveralls that don't
quite cover all...

11:38.906 --> 11:40.366
and a psychotic little boy

11:40.449 --> 11:41.909
who will not stop
hounding me!

11:41.992 --> 11:43.911
This little boy right here.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.706
Sometimes, I wish
this dam would burst

11:46.789 --> 11:49.542
and bury this cursed town.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.756
Hey, you said we were
going to Dairy Queen.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.551
I lied. Now, help me rummage
through Bob's trash for clues.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.178
Then, I promise
we'll go to the water slide.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.388
Okay.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.934
(both screaming)

12:07.017 --> 12:08.602
You again!

12:08.686 --> 12:10.438
Well, that's it.

12:10.521 --> 12:14.734
I'm going to do what I should
have done a long time ago.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.485
(knocking)

12:17.903 --> 12:21.157
Madam, your children
are no more...

12:21.240 --> 12:25.202
than a pair of
ill-bred troublemakers.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.454
Lisa, too?

12:26.537 --> 12:27.705
Especially Lisa.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.708
But especially Bart.

12:30.791 --> 12:34.545
If he crosses me one more time,
just once more--

12:34.628 --> 12:37.006
Well, I can't be held
responsible for my actions.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.257
Well, I hope
Bob fed you

12:38.340 --> 12:39.925
'cause I ate
your dinners.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.720
I know it's hard to accept,
Bart, but face it--

12:42.803 --> 12:45.306
Sideshow Bob has changed.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.724
No, he hasn't.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.100
He's more the same
than ever,

12:48.184 --> 12:50.227
and I know
where the evidence is.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.521
There's only one place
it could possibly be.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.356
Bob's trailer at the
construction site?

12:54.440 --> 12:56.233
That's even better.
Let's go there.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.568
What were you thinking?

12:57.651 --> 12:59.236
The haunted mine.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.913
Blueprints...
concrete invoices...

13:08.996 --> 13:10.790
construction schedules...

13:10.873 --> 13:12.166
If I didn't know better,

13:12.249 --> 13:13.793
I'd swear Bob
was building a dam.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.211
Oh, yeah?

13:15.294 --> 13:17.421
Then explain this.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.964
(gasping)

13:19.048 --> 13:21.967
Bart! There must be millions
of dollars there!

13:22.051 --> 13:24.345
What is Sideshow Bob
doing with--

13:24.428 --> 13:25.554
(rattling)

13:25.638 --> 13:27.348
(grumbling)

13:27.431 --> 13:29.308
(roaring)

13:29.391 --> 13:30.267
(screaming)

13:33.854 --> 13:35.314
Who left the lights on?

13:35.397 --> 13:38.484
Who's in here?
Cletus? Cousin Merl?

13:38.567 --> 13:39.902
Big Hungry Joe?

13:41.946 --> 13:45.699
I think he may
have spotted us.

13:45.783 --> 13:46.867
Run!

13:46.951 --> 13:48.786
(gasping)
You two.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.997
Be careful.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.833
There's hydroelectricity
in there.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.587
Whoops.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.934
Will you children
stop tormenting me?

14:12.017 --> 14:13.853
I've done nothing wrong.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.021
Give it up, Bob.
We found the money.

14:17.481 --> 14:18.983
Where did that come from?

14:19.066 --> 14:21.110
I've never seen that money
before in my life.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.028
Then you must have
had your eyes closed

14:23.112 --> 14:24.572
when you embezzled it.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.908
I told you, I'm not
a criminal anymore.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.618
You want to know
what I've been up to?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.871
Here's a clue
for you, Jack.

14:31.954 --> 14:35.875
100,000 tons of
reinforced concrete.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.840
My God,
it's completely hollow.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.341
What happened
to all the concrete?

14:44.425 --> 14:46.260
You cut back
on building materials

14:46.343 --> 14:48.178
and kept all the money
for yourself.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.179
That's what happened.

14:49.263 --> 14:50.347
Get him, Lis.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.434
But I wasn't in charge
of the money.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.060
Cecil was.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.062
Now, let's stop bickering
and get out of here.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.939
This dam could collapse
at any minute.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.735
CECIL: One minute past sunrise,
to be precise.

15:02.818 --> 15:03.819
SIDESHOW BOB:
Cecil?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.279
Once I blow up the dam

15:05.362 --> 15:07.156
there will be no evidence
of missing concrete

15:07.239 --> 15:10.117
and I walk away
with 15 million.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.202
But everyone will know
you did this.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.079
Perhaps...

15:14.163 --> 15:16.206
or perhaps they'll blame
the master criminal.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.834
You know, the one
who's been working at the dam

15:18.918 --> 15:21.086
and has a grudge
against Springfield.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.631
I know cousin Merl has had
his troubles with the revenuers

15:23.714 --> 15:25.049
but he's hardly a master crim--

15:25.132 --> 15:26.800
Oh. You're referring to me.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.761
Yes. I'm framing you,

15:28.844 --> 15:30.721
and I'm doing a really
excellent job, too.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.431
Wait a minute.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.642
This is all because I got
to be Krusty's sidekick

15:34.725 --> 15:35.935
instead of you, isn't it?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.394
Off the record, yes,

15:37.478 --> 15:39.563
but officially,
I did it for the money.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.023
Speaking of which
hand it over.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.697
Ta.

15:50.574 --> 15:51.992
I forgot to mention,

15:52.076 --> 15:53.953
I'm planning to blow up the dam
with you inside.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.330
Well, obviously.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.665
(lock clicking)

15:57.748 --> 15:59.124
(grunting)

15:59.208 --> 16:01.877
Oh, it's hopeless--
utterly, utterly hopeless.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.837
Oh, I see.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.006
When it's one of my schemes,
you can't foil it fast enough,

16:06.090 --> 16:08.342
but when Cecil tries
to kill you,

16:08.425 --> 16:11.053
"It's hopeless-- utterly,
utterly hopeless."

16:11.136 --> 16:12.179
Well, if you kids
aren't going to foil him,

16:12.262 --> 16:13.597
I'll have to do it myself.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.399
Come on, quickly now.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.652
Bart, for once,
I'm not trying to kill you.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.028
I know it's an
awkward situation,

16:28.112 --> 16:29.488
and I don't like it
any more than you do,

16:29.571 --> 16:31.031
but you've got
to trust me.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.827
Ah, what the hell.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.083
(gasping)

16:45.004 --> 16:46.005
(screaming)

16:57.307 --> 16:58.183
(coughing)

17:03.230 --> 17:04.606
Let's go again.
Let's go again.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.649
No!

17:05.733 --> 17:06.900
Come on, children.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.610
Let's go thwart my brother.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.699
<i>♪ I'm on the top</i>
<i>of the world ♪</i>

17:13.782 --> 17:15.743
<i>♪ Looking down</i>
<i>on creation ♪</i>

17:15.826 --> 17:18.537
<i>♪ And the only explanation</i>
<i>I can find ♪</i>

17:18.620 --> 17:19.538
<i>♪ Boo-boo-boo ♪</i>

17:25.711 --> 17:28.088
Um, do you know
what you're doing?

17:28.172 --> 17:30.382
Lisa, you don't spend
ten years

17:30.466 --> 17:32.134
as a homicidal maniac
without learning

17:32.217 --> 17:33.427
a few things
about dynamite.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.555
Plunger? Check.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.348
Hard hat? Check.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.892
$15 million and a gun?

17:39.975 --> 17:41.477
Checkmate.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.479
Good-bye, Bob.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.231
No!

17:46.315 --> 17:47.357
Guess who?

17:47.441 --> 17:49.234
Maris?

17:53.947 --> 17:54.907
Oh!

17:56.658 --> 17:57.659
Shoot.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.538
Bob, look.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.837
At last, I'm going to do
what Bob never could--

18:08.921 --> 18:11.465
kill Bart Simpson.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.175
By throwing me off a dam?

18:13.258 --> 18:16.261
Isn't that a little crude
for a genius like you?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.305
Ooh, I suppose it is.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.432
If anyone asks, I'll lie.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.934
(screaming)

18:23.227 --> 18:24.853
Bart!

18:32.152 --> 18:33.779
Bart!

18:34.988 --> 18:35.906
(screaming)

18:40.994 --> 18:42.079
Cecil...

18:42.162 --> 18:43.914
And now, to kill you.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.874
There may be a slight
ringing in your ears.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.669
Fortunately, you'll be
nowhere near them.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.672
I guess this is it.
Thanks, anyway.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.632
You know, I could
snip the wires.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.802
We'd fall to our deaths,
but we'd save the entire town.

18:56.885 --> 19:00.430
Bart, how would you like to do
something incredibly noble?

19:00.514 --> 19:02.141
Do we have to?

19:02.224 --> 19:03.851
Yes.

19:03.934 --> 19:04.977
(screaming)

19:09.189 --> 19:10.232
(gasping)

19:10.315 --> 19:12.067
(screaming)

19:20.200 --> 19:22.786
(grunts)

19:22.870 --> 19:25.747
You-- You saved
my life, Bart.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.541
Yeah.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.043
I guess this means you can't
ever try to kill me again, huh?

19:30.127 --> 19:32.379
Oh, I don't know about that.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.631
Joking. Joking.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.508
(sirens wailing)

19:41.722 --> 19:45.225
You've brought shame
to this family, Cecil.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.894
Oh, I don't relish
having to write

19:46.977 --> 19:48.645
the Christmas letter
this year.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.314
Nor I to read it.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.773
You know, Bob,
all this time

19:51.857 --> 19:53.442
I thought
you were a bungler,

19:53.525 --> 19:56.195
but destroying the city
is far tougher than I thought.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.115
Here's your man, chief.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.950
Cecil? I think not.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.704
This looks like the work
of crazy old Sideshow Bob.

20:05.787 --> 20:06.997
No, chief.
Bob's innocent.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.081
It's the truth.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.291
The truth, huh?

20:09.374 --> 20:10.792
That sounds
like the testimony

20:10.876 --> 20:13.170
of crazy old
Lisa Simpson.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.589
Cecil just voluntarily
confessed, chief.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.132
That's some good work, Lou.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.425
You'll make sergeant
for this.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.385
Uh, I already am
a sergeant, chief.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.346
Perhaps you are,
but I say

20:22.429 --> 20:24.306
Bob goes
back to jail.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.809
But, surely--
I mean, I caught Cecil.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.937
Maybe so,
but Lou here says

20:30.020 --> 20:30.979
you were
resisting arrest.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.439
No, I didn't, chief.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.483
Quiet, Lou, or I will
bust you down to sergeant

20:34.566 --> 20:36.068
so fast, it'll make
your head spin.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.321
Funny, isn't it, Lise?

20:39.404 --> 20:40.530
Those people down there

20:40.614 --> 20:42.449
have no idea
how close they came

20:42.532 --> 20:44.284
to complete destruction.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.545
Marge, I'm going
to look for the kids.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.258
(screams)

21:03.470 --> 21:06.139
I think I wet my bed.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.310
But you can't do this.

21:10.394 --> 21:13.355
I saved
the children's lives!

21:13.438 --> 21:15.190
I'm a hero!

21:15.274 --> 21:16.900
Tell them they'll live
to regret this.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.903
You'll live to regret this.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.030
Oh, thanks a lot.
Now I look crazy.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.950
There they go--

21:25.033 --> 21:28.078
two criminal geniuses
locked away together.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.706
Who knows
what diabolical schemes

21:30.789 --> 21:32.291
they might concoct?

21:39.089 --> 21:41.133
You give me--

21:41.216 --> 21:43.385
I'm older.
I get the top bunk.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.553
Oh, poppycock.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.013
I called it
at the arraignment.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.097
Get back.

21:51.059 --> 21:53.937
So, when do
they bring us the menus?

22:40.275 --> 22:41.485
Shh!

22:44.571 --> 22:47.824
