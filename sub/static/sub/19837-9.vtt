00:20.140 --> 00:23.250

<b>And some incredible people are

00:27.790 --> 00:29.290
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.420 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:55.620 --> 01:56.260
<b>I...</b>

01:56.260 --> 01:58.760
<b>I give!</b>

01:58.760 --> 01:59.640
<b>Huh?</b>

01:59.640 --> 02:00.510
<b>What?</b>

02:00.510 --> 02:01.760
<b>Bastard...</b>

02:02.660 --> 02:05.020
<b>You just confirmed all my suspicions!</b>

02:05.020 --> 02:07.060
<b>You're a worthless piece of trash,</b>

02:07.060 --> 02:10.520
<b>who's only good for sabotaging 
other applicants!</b>

02:10.700 --> 02:12.270
<b>Exactly.</b>

02:12.270 --> 02:14.310
<b>That's what I do every year.</b>

02:14.890 --> 02:18.020
<b>And I plan to continue the tradition.</b>

02:18.750 --> 02:23.030
<b>I'm not looking to pass the Hunter Exam.</b>

02:40.490 --> 02:43.210
<b>Gon and his friends have chosen to partake</b>

02:43.210 --> 02:46.180
<b>in a five-on-five battle with 
some of the prisoners.</b>

02:46.820 --> 02:50.190
<b>Due to Tonpa's actions,

02:51.650 --> 02:53.190
<b>The next round</b>

02:53.190 --> 02:55.250
<b>will pit Gon against Sedokan.</b>

02:56.540 --> 02:59.790
<b>What will happen in the upcoming battle?</b>

03:01.740 --> 03:02.790
<b>Now, then...</b>

<b>Sedokan

03:03.150 --> 03:06.450
<b>As you can see, I'm not very strong.</b>

03:06.450 --> 03:08.550
<b>I don't really enjoy fistfights</b>

03:08.550 --> 03:11.140
<b>or other physical activities, 
such as running and jumping.</b>

03:11.140 --> 03:13.550
<b>I do.</b>

03:13.550 --> 03:16.660
<b>But I'm not too good at using my head.</b>

03:16.660 --> 03:17.960
<b>As I thought.</b>

03:18.910 --> 03:22.470
<b>So I came up with a simple game 
we could both play.</b>

03:22.470 --> 03:23.820
<b>A game?</b>

03:23.820 --> 03:24.710
<b>Yes.</b>

03:24.710 --> 03:28.760
<b>It doesn't rely on either mental 
or physical activity.</b>

03:28.760 --> 03:29.980
<b>What kind of game?</b>

03:34.890 --> 03:37.640
<b>We each light a candle at the same time.</b>

03:37.640 --> 03:40.540
<b>The one whose candle goes 
out first is the loser.</b>

03:40.540 --> 03:41.490
<b>What do you think?</b>

03:41.490 --> 03:43.570
<b>Yeah! That's easy to understand.</b>

03:43.570 --> 03:45.100
<b>Let's go with that.</b>

03:45.100 --> 03:47.120
<b>Okay. In that case...</b>

03:54.800 --> 03:58.880
<b>...decide which candle you want to use.</b>

03:58.880 --> 04:01.010
<b>Press O for the long one,</b>

04:01.580 --> 04:04.240
<b>or X for the short one.</b>

04:05.810 --> 04:07.890
<b>This will be determined 
by majority rule.</b>

04:08.630 --> 04:10.670
<b>We have to choose one?</b>

04:10.670 --> 04:12.770
<b>This is a trap!</b>

04:13.150 --> 04:15.550
<b>Normally, you'd choose the long one,</b>

04:15.550 --> 04:19.570
<b>so he must have done something 
to the long one!</b>

04:19.570 --> 04:22.680
<b>That would be the safe assumption.</b>

04:22.680 --> 04:24.420
<b>But it might be a trick,</b>

04:24.420 --> 04:26.970
<b>and he's actually tampered 
with the short one.</b>

04:27.780 --> 04:30.890
<b>When you put it like that...</b>

04:30.890 --> 04:33.040
<b>Yes, there is no end...</b>

04:33.690 --> 04:35.930
<b>You've got a real dilemma there.</b>

04:35.930 --> 04:37.650
<b>You keep your mouth shut!</b>

04:37.650 --> 04:38.670
<b>Yeah, yeah.</b>

04:40.250 --> 04:43.670
<b>When presented with a 
clearly uneven choice,</b>

04:44.140 --> 04:48.180
<b>people become suspicious and 
hesitate before deciding.</b>

04:48.180 --> 04:51.680
<b>Yes, this is a real dilemma.</b>

04:51.680 --> 04:56.490
<b>What's worse, if you make the wrong choice, 
the resulting mental anguish</b>

04:56.490 --> 05:00.870
<b>would be much greater than if the problem 
had offered two fair options.</b>

05:08.080 --> 05:10.510
<b>Take your time.</b>

05:10.510 --> 05:14.960
<b>This may be a majority decision, 
but you're free to discuss it.</b>

05:15.630 --> 05:19.460
<b>We have plenty of time.</b>

05:19.460 --> 05:20.150
<b>Hmm...</b>

05:20.150 --> 05:21.960
<b>Hey, which one should I choose?</b>

05:21.960 --> 05:23.650
<b>Damn...</b>

05:23.650 --> 05:25.470
<b>Which one should we take?</b>

05:40.110 --> 05:42.610
<b>Gon, you decide!</b>

05:43.830 --> 05:46.630
<b>We'll abide by your decision.</b>

05:46.630 --> 05:48.340
<b>Choose the one you think is best.</b>

05:48.340 --> 05:49.960
<b>Are you sure about this?</b>

05:49.960 --> 05:52.870
<b>He never thinks anything through.</b>

05:52.870 --> 05:55.490
<b>Instead of wasting time fretting 
over what to do,</b>

05:55.490 --> 05:57.990
<b>let's rely on Gon's instincts.</b>

05:58.710 --> 06:00.880
<b>Instincts, huh...</b>

06:00.880 --> 06:02.660
<b>I get to choose?</b>

06:02.660 --> 06:03.900
<b>Okay!</b>

06:03.900 --> 06:05.880
<b>Then I choose the long one!</b>

06:07.230 --> 06:09.390
<b>You want the long candle?</b>

06:09.390 --> 06:13.890
<b>Because a longer candle 
will burn a longer time!</b>

06:14.780 --> 06:17.240
<b>Er, he's just taking it at face value?</b>

06:17.240 --> 06:20.150
<b>I knew he wouldn't think this through.</b>

06:20.630 --> 06:22.610
<b>Well, that's that.</b>

06:24.560 --> 06:28.390
<b>It's not like we can figure out 
which one is the trap.</b>

06:33.470 --> 06:34.790
<b>Okay.</b>

06:34.790 --> 06:37.490
<b>You get the long one.</b>

06:37.490 --> 06:39.290
<b>I'll take the short one.</b>

06:46.040 --> 06:48.760
<b>Now, we light our candles together.</b>

07:18.040 --> 07:19.040
<b>Normally,</b>

07:19.680 --> 07:23.040
<b>how long would it take that 
candle to burn down?</b>

07:23.040 --> 07:26.300
<b>Five to six hours?</b>

07:33.050 --> 07:36.060
<b>Whoa... That was close.</b>

07:40.060 --> 07:42.560
<b>A strong wind is coming from below.</b>

07:42.560 --> 07:46.620
<b>That means we should watch our step...</b>

07:46.620 --> 07:49.570
<b>No time to relax, huh...</b>

08:02.690 --> 08:05.710
<b>If you don't pay attention, 
your candle will go out.</b>

08:05.710 --> 08:09.510
<b>That's because you're planning 
to do something bad.</b>

08:10.360 --> 08:13.470
<b>Otherwise, your candle would go out first.</b>

08:13.470 --> 08:15.090
<b>I won't do anything.</b>

08:16.790 --> 08:17.970
<b>After all...</b>

08:17.970 --> 08:19.970
<b>I've already taken steps.</b>

08:29.260 --> 08:30.480
<b>See?</b>

08:30.480 --> 08:33.590
<b>Hey! Look at Gon's candle!</b>

08:33.590 --> 08:35.840
<b>The flame suddenly became stronger!</b>

08:36.370 --> 08:41.000
<b>He must have hidden gunpowder or some other 
highly flammable substance inside,</b>

08:41.490 --> 08:43.910
<b>to make the candle burn faster!</b>

08:47.320 --> 08:49.430
<b>H-Hot...</b>

08:49.890 --> 08:52.930
<b>At this rate, his candle will only last 
another two or three minutes.</b>

08:52.930 --> 08:54.010
<b>Damn!</b>

08:54.010 --> 08:56.480
<b>Hey! That was dirty!</b>

08:56.480 --> 08:59.260
<b>I knew you tampered with 
the long candle!</b>

09:00.540 --> 09:03.270
<b><i>Heh, you're wrong.</i></b>

09:03.890 --> 09:06.650
<b><i>I had four candles prepared.</i></b>

09:06.650 --> 09:09.560
<b><i>The dilemma you faced was mere</i></b>

09:09.560 --> 09:13.030
<b><i>camouflage for the actual trap.</i></b>

09:13.660 --> 09:17.780
<b><i>You were given the impression that only 
one candle had been interfered with.</i></b>

09:18.250 --> 09:21.520
<b><i>The choices were so uneven, 
you didn't consider</i></b>

09:21.520 --> 09:24.790
<b><i>the possibility that both had been.</i></b>

09:26.110 --> 09:31.050
<b><i>It didn't matter which candle you picked.</i></b>

09:32.070 --> 09:35.250
<b><i>Either way, I would have handed you</i></b>

09:35.250 --> 09:37.550
<b><i>an oil-soaked candle.</i></b>

09:46.270 --> 09:49.060
<b>If the fire is stronger,</b>

09:50.510 --> 09:53.190
<b>then a little breeze won't extinguish it.</b>

09:57.360 --> 09:58.610
<b>He's fast!</b>

10:05.760 --> 10:07.120
<b>I win!</b>

10:09.590 --> 10:10.880
<b>Yes!</b>

10:15.160 --> 10:19.890
<b>Oh, he has a real spring to his step.</b>

10:21.150 --> 10:23.960
<b>And the ability to take advantage 
of a bad situation.</b>

10:23.960 --> 10:26.890
<b>I'm impressed by this boy.</b>

10:30.300 --> 10:32.470
<b>Yay! I won!</b>

10:32.470 --> 10:34.020
<b>Good job, Gon!</b>

10:34.020 --> 10:35.400
<b>Now we have a win!</b>

10:35.800 --> 10:38.690
<b>Once Kurapika and I win, 
we can advance!</b>

10:40.380 --> 10:42.310
<b>Hmph, you fool.</b>

10:42.310 --> 10:44.910
<b>That's the result of reliance on 
tools and cheap tricks.</b>

10:46.900 --> 10:47.910
<b>Tsk.</b>

10:47.910 --> 10:51.990
<b>If you want to fool someone, 
you have to sacrifice a bit.</b>

10:51.990 --> 10:53.420
<b>Just watch.</b>

11:00.530 --> 11:01.780
<b>All right.</b>

11:01.780 --> 11:03.430
<b>I'll go next.</b>

<b>And face...</b>

12:10.980 --> 12:12.410
<b>Look here!</b>

12:12.930 --> 12:16.260
<b>I've killed nineteen people,</b>

12:16.260 --> 12:20.420
<b>but it bugs me that nineteen is 
such an uneven number.</b>

12:22.770 --> 12:25.930
<b>I'm so glad I've gotten to 
meet number twenty.</b>

12:29.730 --> 12:32.560
<b>Now we have a serial killer?</b>

12:32.560 --> 12:36.950
<b>I insist that we put our lives on the line.</b>

12:36.950 --> 12:39.570
<b>I won't accept some half-assed contest.</b>

<b>Blood!</b>

<b>Entrails!</b>

<b>Agony!</b>

12:49.390 --> 12:50.250
<b><i>Well?</i></b>

12:50.250 --> 12:53.080
<b><i>You must be scared now...</i></b>

12:54.050 --> 12:55.050
<b>Very well.</b>

12:55.450 --> 12:56.080
<b>Huh?</b>

12:56.550 --> 12:58.710
<b>You can decide how we 
settle this contest.</b>

12:58.710 --> 13:00.440
<b>I'll agree to your choice.</b>

<b><i>I know you're quaking in your boots.</i></b>

<b><i>How long can you maintain

13:12.490 --> 13:14.530
<b>In that case, I also propose</b>

<b>a death match, where we fight until</b>

<b>one of us surrenders or dies.</b>

<b>However, don't expect me to stop</b>

<b><i>Well?</i></b>

13:34.580 --> 13:36.740
<b><i>Surely you're scared stiff now?</i></b>

<b>Very well. I accept.</b>

13:40.400 --> 13:41.250
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

13:46.670 --> 13:47.760
<b>Let us begin.</b>

13:48.970 --> 13:50.630
<b><i>Is he an idiot?</i></b>

13:50.630 --> 13:52.580
<b><i>Didn't he hear what I said?</i></b>

13:52.580 --> 13:55.770
<b><i>We're fighting to the death!</i></b>

13:56.340 --> 13:59.770
<b><i>Wait, he should have been scared

14:00.170 --> 14:01.580
<b>Hold on.</b>

<b>No weapons allowed.</b>

<b>We'll beat each other to death

<b>After all, while I may be hired as

14:13.750 --> 14:17.620
<b>I'm not allowed to carry weapons.</b>

14:18.240 --> 14:19.530
<b>I see.</b>

14:19.530 --> 14:21.290
<b>I understand.</b>

14:24.350 --> 14:26.430
<b>Anything else?</b>

14:26.430 --> 14:28.650
<b>If not, I'd like to get started.</b>

14:28.650 --> 14:29.760
<b>Huh?</b>

14:32.060 --> 14:33.850
<b><i>That little bastard...</i></b>

14:33.850 --> 14:36.290
<b><i>He had a concealed weapon!</i></b>

14:36.290 --> 14:38.320
<b><i>That was close.</i></b>

14:38.320 --> 14:41.670
<b><i>However, it appears that

14:41.670 --> 14:44.560
<b><i>He's that confident in his fighting ability?</i></b>

14:44.560 --> 14:47.530
<b><i>No, that doesn't seem to be the case.</i></b>

14:49.130 --> 14:51.500
<b><i>Hmph, maybe he wants to run,</i></b>

14:51.500 --> 14:55.220
<b><i>but he can't in front of his friends.</i></b>

14:55.850 --> 15:01.460
<b><i>Or he's so stupid, he can't even imagine</i></b>

15:01.460 --> 15:03.080
<b><i>how scary I am?</i></b>

15:03.080 --> 15:06.090
<b><i>Yes! That must be it...</i></b>

15:08.690 --> 15:10.960
<b><i>Well, in that case,</i></b>

15:10.960 --> 15:14.600
<b><i>I have a couple of cards up my sleeve

<b>Hey, now.</b>

15:27.160 --> 15:28.970
<b>Is Kurapika gonna be okay?</b>

15:28.970 --> 15:31.610
<b>This guy looks dangerous.</b>

15:32.530 --> 15:35.120
<b><i>In what way does he look dangerous?</i></b>

15:35.800 --> 15:37.320
<b><i>As far as I can tell,</i></b>

15:37.320 --> 15:41.210
<b><i>this guy's just a blowhard who 
doesn't have the guts</i></b>

<b><i>to hit anyone, let alone kill anyone.</i></b>

15:44.660 --> 15:46.400
<b>You don't need to worry.</b>

15:46.400 --> 15:47.130
<b>Huh?</b>

15:47.640 --> 15:48.720
<b>Why not?</b>

15:48.720 --> 15:51.960
<b>Because when I look at him,

15:51.960 --> 15:53.140
<b>What does that mean?</b>

16:00.310 --> 16:03.650
<b>Time to show you the ace up my sleeve!</b>

16:05.490 --> 16:06.850
<b>I'll see you dead!</b>

16:06.850 --> 16:07.860
<b>Here he comes!</b>

16:20.290 --> 16:21.550
<b>Wow...</b>

16:21.550 --> 16:23.790
<b>He made a hole in the floor

16:27.500 --> 16:29.260
<b><i>That was perfect...</i></b>

16:29.950 --> 16:32.800
<b><i>And I still have one more trick.</i></b>

16:46.020 --> 16:49.860
<b>A tattoo of a spider with twelve legs...</b>

16:49.860 --> 16:51.030
<b>That's...</b>

16:51.030 --> 16:53.530
<b>Yeah, I recognize it.</b>

16:54.180 --> 16:59.030
<b>Anyone aspiring to become 
a Hunter has heard of it.</b>

17:00.750 --> 17:04.160
<b>That's the symbol worn by members of 
that notorious band of evil thieves,</b>

17:04.160 --> 17:06.940
<b>the Phantom Troupe!</b>

17:09.590 --> 17:10.950
<b>Really?</b>

17:10.950 --> 17:13.510
<b>Yeah, definitely.</b>

17:13.510 --> 17:15.050
<b>They're famous.</b>

17:15.590 --> 17:19.050
<b>I heard about them 
straight from Kurapika.</b>

17:32.020 --> 17:34.070
<b><i>Between the steel implanted in my body</i></b>

17:34.590 --> 17:37.520
<b><i>that gives my arms 
the strength to shatter rock,</i></b>

17:37.520 --> 17:39.580
<b><i>and the Phantom Troupe symbol...</i></b>

17:40.230 --> 17:42.580
<b><i>After seeing both,</i></b>

17:42.580 --> 17:46.260
<b><i>no one would want to fight me!</i></b>

17:48.880 --> 17:50.580
<b>What's wrong?</b>

17:50.580 --> 17:52.470
<b>Cat got your tongue?</b>

17:55.090 --> 17:59.790
<b>I'm Majitani, one of the 
Phantom Troupe's four kings!</b>

17:59.790 --> 18:02.100
<b>Consider that first strike 
my way of saying hello.</b>

18:03.410 --> 18:05.840
<b>This is your last chance to surrender.</b>

18:05.840 --> 18:08.070
<b>I'm still willing to...</b>

18:09.710 --> 18:10.520
<b>Huh?</b>

18:20.480 --> 18:24.540
<b>Wh-What's wrong with you?</b>

18:25.290 --> 18:26.040
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

18:27.040 --> 18:28.500
<b><i>Wh-What?</i></b>

18:36.320 --> 18:38.010
<b>O-O-Okay...</b>

18:38.010 --> 18:40.750
<b>Wait! I get it!</b>

18:40.750 --> 18:42.750
<b>I surrender!</b>

19:06.360 --> 19:07.960
<b>Consider this a warning...</b>

19:08.480 --> 19:09.970
<b>First,</b>

19:09.970 --> 19:15.560
<b>a real Phantom Troupe tattoo has the 
member's number on the spider.</b>

19:17.070 --> 19:18.520
<b>Second,</b>

19:18.520 --> 19:23.550
<b>they don't bother counting 
how many they've killed.</b>

19:24.590 --> 19:26.030
<b>Third,</b>

19:26.030 --> 19:29.030
<b>never mention the Troupe again.</b>

19:30.890 --> 19:32.340
<b>If you do,</b>

19:32.970 --> 19:35.420
<b>I'll kill you.</b>

19:46.850 --> 19:48.520
<b>Wow...</b>

19:49.400 --> 19:51.250
<b>Kurapika...</b>

19:52.040 --> 19:54.990
<b>Well, saw that coming 
from a mile away.</b>

19:56.210 --> 19:57.250
<b>Yup...</b>

20:09.490 --> 20:11.930
<b>You okay, Kurapika?</b>

20:11.930 --> 20:14.690
<b>Yeah, I'm not injured.</b>

20:14.690 --> 20:16.130
<b>Also,</b>

20:16.130 --> 20:18.490
<b>is it safe for us to be near you?</b>

20:20.410 --> 20:25.780
<b>From the moment I saw him, 
I knew he was weak.</b>

20:26.370 --> 20:31.260
<b>And mentally, I knew that 
tattoo was a fake.</b>

20:31.260 --> 20:34.150
<b>But as soon as I saw that spider,</b>

20:34.150 --> 20:36.790
<b>everything in my sight turned red...</b>

20:37.920 --> 20:39.960
<b>Well, I can't really blame you.</b>

20:39.960 --> 20:41.890
<b>Actually, to tell the truth...</b>

20:41.890 --> 20:42.800
<b>Hmm?</b>

20:43.410 --> 20:46.040
<b>Even when I see a real spider,</b>

20:46.040 --> 20:48.810
<b>my personality changes, 
and I enter a frenzy.</b>

20:51.050 --> 20:53.810
<b>You should have told us sooner...</b>

20:55.440 --> 20:57.130
<b>But this means that</b>

20:57.130 --> 21:01.290
<b>the rage in me remains 
as strong as ever.</b>

21:01.290 --> 21:03.780
<b>I suppose I should be happy.</b>

21:04.690 --> 21:08.060
<b>We should keep Kurapika 
away from spiders.</b>

21:08.060 --> 21:09.220
<b>Definitely.</b>

21:11.010 --> 21:12.790
<b>Damn you, Majitani...</b>

21:12.790 --> 21:15.580
<b>You were completely worthless.</b>

21:15.580 --> 21:19.500
<b>His facial scars were from a botched 
plastic surgery operation.</b>

21:19.500 --> 21:21.590
<b>That's one hell of a fraud.</b>

21:21.590 --> 21:24.440
<b>Hey, you understand, right?</b>

21:24.440 --> 21:26.760
<b>After two losses, our backs 
are against the wall.</b>

21:26.760 --> 21:28.100
<b>Let me handle it.</b>

21:28.990 --> 21:30.920
<b>I have a good idea.</b>

21:35.640 --> 21:39.610
<b>Okay! I'll secure our victory!</b>

21:42.330 --> 21:44.610
<b>Kurapika has defeated Majitani.</b>

21:45.270 --> 21:49.200
<b>Another win, and they 
will clear this trial.</b>

21:51.530 --> 21:55.170
<b>How will Leorio handle</b>

21:55.170 --> 21:57.670
<b>the next challenge?</b>

23:27.320 --> 23:29.780
<b>Next time: Trick x To The x Trick!</b>

23:29.780 --> 23:32.680
<b>The trick to the trick is to trick... 
I can't say it.</b>

23:32.680 --> 23:34.050
<b>Don't just give up.</b>
