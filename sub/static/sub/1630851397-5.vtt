WEST ZEALAND, 1985

00:20.791 --> 00:24.250
<i>Chestnut man</i>
<i>Come on inside</i>

00:24.333 --> 00:27.416
<i>Chestnut man</i>
<i>Come on inside</i>

00:27.500 --> 00:32.083
<i>Do you have some chestnuts</i>
<i>For me today</i>

00:32.958 --> 00:35.125
<i>Thank you very much</i>

00:37.000 --> 00:39.333
Don't prick it.
Try drilling it like Astrid.

00:43.250 --> 00:44.083
Try again.

00:45.125 --> 00:46.958
How many do we need?

00:47.041 --> 00:50.208
We can make a large family
and put them in a circle.

00:53.083 --> 00:53.958
Rosa?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.083
Do you have a minute?

01:10.875 --> 01:11.958
We…

01:13.958 --> 01:16.750
We've talked about keeping the twins.

01:17.708 --> 01:22.125
Toke and Astrid had a rough time,
and they need a good home.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.375
Dad and I think our home could be theirs.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.375
-Forever?
-Yes.

01:31.458 --> 01:33.666
If it's okay with you, sweetie.

01:37.375 --> 01:38.375
Are you sure?

01:44.833 --> 01:47.875
Come on, Rosa.
Let's go and tell the twins the good news.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.875
<i>Three days ago, police in Copenhagen</i>
<i>found the two murderers</i>

02:25.958 --> 02:28.375
<i>in what appeared to be a murder-suicide.</i>

02:28.458 --> 02:32.291
<i>Police found no evidence</i>
<i>that the killers were connected</i>

02:32.375 --> 02:35.708
<i>to the murder</i>
<i>of Rosa Hartung's daughter last fall.</i>

02:36.250 --> 02:42.083
<i>The case is solved and will be closed</i>
<i>after a press briefing later today.</i>

02:43.125 --> 02:45.000
<i>The social minister, Rosa Hartung's--</i>

02:46.916 --> 02:47.958
Vogel's here.

02:50.208 --> 02:51.458
Do you want him to leave?

02:53.083 --> 02:53.916
I'm coming.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.625
We talked about emptying Kristine's room.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.500
-I think--
-We'll do it today.

03:20.625 --> 03:22.125
Let's go. I'll be right there.

03:22.208 --> 03:24.083
I don't want to. I'll cycle.

03:25.625 --> 03:28.583
No, you're not.
We agreed that I'll drive you to--

03:28.666 --> 03:29.791
No, not anymore.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.500
And you know why.

03:33.291 --> 03:35.791
I'll go with Victor and Thor.
Nothing's going to happen.

03:38.583 --> 03:39.875
She'll be out in a while.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I'll wait.

04:00.791 --> 04:03.500
Can we talk later?

04:04.041 --> 04:07.583
Not really. The PM wants
an online meeting with you.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.500
Our position's weakened
since you supported Steen.

04:12.458 --> 04:13.291
So…

04:14.375 --> 04:15.541
We need to make a plan.

04:21.666 --> 04:23.875
I had a strange dream.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.083
I…

04:28.833 --> 04:30.958
I think it was a dream, but I'm not sure.

04:32.625 --> 04:33.958
Maybe it wasn't important.

04:35.791 --> 04:37.250
But the meeting is.

04:38.416 --> 04:41.041
We'll get through this. We always do.

05:21.958 --> 05:25.958
THE CHESTNUT MAN

05:30.708 --> 05:32.458
FRIDAY, 23 OCTOBER

05:32.541 --> 05:35.291
I'm going on a tech course
this afternoon in Jutland.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.166
Then I have a few weeks off.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.875
It'll be nice to relax for a bit, right?

05:39.958 --> 05:41.083
Sure.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.875
It's a shame Hess lost it like that.

05:45.708 --> 05:48.541
-Is he back in The Hague?
-I don't know.

05:48.625 --> 05:51.750
I tried calling him,
but he's not picking up.

05:51.833 --> 05:52.666
I see.

05:53.833 --> 05:55.500
I thought you two were good.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.166
Except for too much noise
and too little substance to his theories.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.083
Don't you think?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.958
He did have reason to complain.

06:08.041 --> 06:10.041
There were no signs
that Skans and the driver

06:10.125 --> 06:12.500
were interested in the murdered women.

06:12.583 --> 06:16.708
The body parts in the fridge
could've been planted there.

06:16.791 --> 06:19.750
There weren't any chestnuts
with Kristine's prints either.

06:20.791 --> 06:23.291
So you think Nylander
closed the case prematurely?

06:23.375 --> 06:25.833
We don't know for sure

06:25.916 --> 06:29.208
if Skans and the driver
planted those chestnuts.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.041
Wait until I'm on leave
before you re-open the case.

06:38.750 --> 06:39.583
What is it?

06:40.291 --> 06:41.458
It's…

06:41.541 --> 06:45.166
It's my daughter and her friend.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.875
-I see.
-It's complicated.

06:46.958 --> 06:49.000
She is staying with her grandpa.

06:54.000 --> 06:54.875
Hi, sweetie.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.083
Hello, you two.

07:00.541 --> 07:01.541
It's good to see you.

07:01.625 --> 07:03.125
-Hi, Fiona!
-Hi.

07:03.208 --> 07:05.750
You look great, really scary.

07:06.291 --> 07:07.916
Fiona and I are giving a speech.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.333
I know and I'll be there.
I can't wait, and I'll bring a pumpkin.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.416
Do you want to come home after that?

07:15.375 --> 07:16.666
It's my last day at work.

07:18.708 --> 07:19.541
Who are you?

07:19.625 --> 07:22.416
-I'm Simon.
-We work together.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.791
Or "worked." Your mom's changing jobs.

07:25.875 --> 07:28.041
Yes, so we'll have more time together.

07:28.125 --> 07:29.458
Where are you two off to?

07:29.541 --> 07:32.750
-A Halloween party.
-I see. Aren't you scared?

07:33.708 --> 07:34.958
Do you know what happens?

07:35.041 --> 07:39.750
You'll wake the dead from their graves,
and they'll rise and eat you for dinner

07:39.833 --> 07:42.083
with pancakes and jam.

07:51.458 --> 07:52.541
Right.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.458
Access card for the premises.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.583
For the fitness center and…

07:59.000 --> 08:01.250
-Locker key.
-Are you coming to the press briefing?

08:01.333 --> 08:02.750
-No.
-Car key?

08:03.791 --> 08:07.125
We'll name Benedikte Skans
and Jacob Rasouli as the murderers.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.791
-Thanks for everything.
-Thank you.

08:10.875 --> 08:14.250
The last couple of days weren't great,
but you righted the ship.

08:14.333 --> 08:17.000
Good luck with the IT nerds.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.333
Thanks.

08:18.416 --> 08:22.750
The pathologist is asking if you need
more data for the press briefing.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.708
-Yes, please.
-All right.

08:26.333 --> 08:27.416
Good luck over there.

08:29.541 --> 08:31.000
-Thulin?
-Yes.

08:31.083 --> 08:33.750
I emailed the photos
you and Hess asked for.

08:33.833 --> 08:34.666
-Photos?
-Yes.

08:34.750 --> 08:38.375
-There's an indexed list in the email.
-Which photos?

08:38.458 --> 08:42.708
You asked for a list
of the crimes Bekker was interested in.

08:42.791 --> 08:45.875
Sorry, I didn't tell you,
but it's my last day.

08:45.958 --> 08:49.333
So… Thanks, but I'll owe you one.

08:49.416 --> 08:50.500
Yes, at least one.

08:53.791 --> 08:55.916
-Let me get that.
-Thanks.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.208
So…

08:58.958 --> 09:01.166
-Good luck.
-Thanks, Abildgård. See you.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.083
See you.

09:06.875 --> 09:11.666
WANTED MAN ARRESTED - HANS HENRIK HAUGE -
WANTED FOR VIOLENCE AND PEDOPHILIA

09:18.750 --> 09:22.208
There you go.
You managed fine once you got started.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.208
I had a bit of extra time.

09:25.208 --> 09:28.083
-Do I need to sign right away?
-I don't have the papers.

09:29.041 --> 09:32.208
Can you print them?
I want to get rid of the apartment now.

09:32.291 --> 09:34.958
Sure, but we need
a management agreement first.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.041
I'll send it once I get it from Riswan.

09:40.125 --> 09:41.250
Your phone's ringing.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.041
Let it ring.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.166
Mark Hess' phone.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.625
Just a minute. Here's the boss.

09:55.583 --> 09:57.416
-It's Hess.
-<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

09:58.375 --> 09:59.750
<i>I've good news.</i>

10:00.625 --> 10:02.625
<i>They found Hauge. He's been arrested.</i>

10:04.250 --> 10:06.166
<i>-</i>I know.
-<i>I see.</i>

10:06.250 --> 10:08.250
I mean… I…

10:09.833 --> 10:12.708
I'm leaving today,
and I just spoke to Abildgård.

10:12.791 --> 10:15.333
He told me they found him
at a gas station.

10:15.416 --> 10:18.291
So everything worked out with your job?

10:18.375 --> 10:20.375
-<i>Yes.</i>
<i>-</i>You're going back to The Hague?

10:20.458 --> 10:23.041
<i>I'm going to Bucharest.</i>
<i>There's a case waiting, so…</i>

10:25.291 --> 10:26.333
<i>I might as well.</i>

10:28.125 --> 10:31.583
Okay. It's my last day too, so…

10:31.666 --> 10:34.208
<i>-That's right. Congratulations.</i>
<i>-</i>Thank you.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.208
But…

10:42.375 --> 10:46.250
Well, take care of yourself, okay? Bye!

10:46.333 --> 10:47.541
Say hi to Le.

10:51.666 --> 10:54.833
And if anyone asks for your address?

10:54.916 --> 10:55.958
They won't.

11:03.708 --> 11:06.083
ROSA HARTUNG RETURNS AS SOCIAL MINISTER

11:08.416 --> 11:11.458
Did you get them?
The murderers of those women?

11:13.291 --> 11:15.500
-Yes.
-My son thinks you're a hero.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.791
I'm no hero. Probably more of a hindrance.

11:35.750 --> 11:36.958
To the airport, please.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.041
Thanks for all your help.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.083
Wow, we carved a lot of pumpkins.

11:46.166 --> 11:48.208
-Hi!
-Hi Naia.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.458
-Hi and welcome.
-Thanks.

11:53.583 --> 11:57.166
-I'm sorry about…
-Let's not mention it again.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.750
-How was your last day?
-It was good.

12:00.833 --> 12:04.875
Oh, my days! You're so scary.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.500
Did you make that for me? It's beautiful.

12:08.291 --> 12:09.333
Thank you.

12:09.416 --> 12:11.833
Wait until you see
what I have for you and Fiona.

12:13.041 --> 12:13.875
Pumpkins.

12:13.958 --> 12:16.250
Why didn't you carve them
like everybody else?

12:17.125 --> 12:19.208
I thought we were doing it here.

12:19.291 --> 12:23.000
No one's going to notice.
We'll help tidy up instead.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.291
Come on in.
She's been looking forward to it.

LINUS BEKKER - FAVORITES

13:26.958 --> 13:29.208
THE MOTHER

13:33.541 --> 13:37.666
In 2008,
Denmark produced 400,000 pumpkins.

13:37.750 --> 13:42.083
Today, the figure exceeds 800,000,
so Halloween is here to stay.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.375
Thank you, Le.

13:45.458 --> 13:50.291
The girls have prepared
a delicious, autumnal dish for us.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.750
-We've baked… chestnuts.
-Yeah.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.625
Please come over here and have some.

13:57.708 --> 14:01.166
Le and Fiona will tell you everything
they've learned about chestnuts.

<i>Passengers on SK224 to Bucharest.</i>
<i>The plane is ready to board.</i>

14:49.625 --> 14:50.875
<i>We're ready for boarding.</i>

14:51.875 --> 14:54.250
What else do you need to remember?

14:54.333 --> 14:58.208
Choosing the right kind of chestnuts,
sweet chestnuts.

14:58.291 --> 14:59.208
That's right.

15:01.916 --> 15:02.916
Thank you very much.

15:03.875 --> 15:07.958
No two chestnuts are the same.
There are a lot of different kinds.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.833
They grow in different places,
and they all look different too.

15:12.416 --> 15:15.500
-A little bird told me--
-Sorry.

15:16.375 --> 15:19.375
When you say
that there are different kinds,

15:19.958 --> 15:21.250
what do you mean?

15:23.833 --> 15:25.958
There are two different species.

15:26.541 --> 15:30.750
Horse chestnuts and sweet chestnuts.
Each species have sub-species.

15:31.541 --> 15:35.041
They all look different
depending on where they grow.

15:37.291 --> 15:38.125
Thank you.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.791
Le, would you come with me?

15:44.541 --> 15:48.416
-What on earth?
-Don't say anything right now.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.500
It's time you decided
if you want to be here or there.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.250
-I know.
-Think about Le's feelings here!

15:54.333 --> 15:56.625
I consider her feelings all the time.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.583
I constantly think about her being upset.

16:00.666 --> 16:04.750
That it's all my fault.
That I'm a shitty mom,

16:04.833 --> 16:07.291
because she'd rather stay
anywhere else than with me.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.875
-Hi Le.
-Hi, honey.

16:13.625 --> 16:14.500
Come here.

16:16.458 --> 16:18.166
Listen up.

16:20.333 --> 16:21.875
I'm so proud of you.

16:22.583 --> 16:23.791
I miss you.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.333
I love you.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.583
I have to go now.

16:30.833 --> 16:33.958
I have some work I need to finish,

16:34.041 --> 16:35.750
but you're the best thing I have.

16:38.416 --> 16:39.291
The best.

16:46.125 --> 16:47.666
It's about the murder case

16:47.750 --> 16:50.958
that Bekker clicked on the most
when he hacked the files.

16:51.041 --> 16:54.875
I can't see the case file, just photos,
but I need to read the file.

16:54.958 --> 16:58.750
<i>There is nothing about the case</i>
<i>in the crime scene records, only photos.</i>

16:59.500 --> 17:01.708
<i>But I can see</i>
<i>that the case is from 1987, on Møn.</i>

17:01.791 --> 17:05.125
So the file doesn't identify the murderer
or who lived in the house?

17:05.208 --> 17:06.625
<i>Not as far as I can see.</i>

17:07.208 --> 17:10.750
<i>The case was investigated</i>
<i>by John Brink of the police on Møn.</i>

17:10.833 --> 17:13.541
-Could you repeat his name, please?
-<i>John Brink.</i>

17:17.833 --> 17:18.791
What's the address?

17:19.791 --> 17:21.500
<i>Vadbro Torv 12, Stege.</i>

17:23.125 --> 17:24.666
-Number 12?
<i>-Yes.</i>

17:26.166 --> 17:29.250
Great. One more thing though.
Did Thulin see this?

17:29.333 --> 17:30.208
<i>I don't think so.</i>

17:30.291 --> 17:32.791
<i>Today was her last day,</i>
<i>so her mind was elsewhere.</i>

17:35.166 --> 17:36.333
Great. Thanks.

17:42.458 --> 17:43.541
Are you almost ready?

17:44.541 --> 17:45.958
She'll be there in a minute.

17:51.375 --> 17:55.083
I jotted down a few sentences
in case you stall.

17:55.166 --> 17:57.916
Just remember what we talked about.
Stay the course.

17:59.875 --> 18:02.291
-I got it.
-Super. Great. Here she is.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.750
<i>-Hi Rosa. Great to see you.</i>
-Hi.

18:05.833 --> 18:06.833
<i>How are you doing?</i>

18:07.916 --> 18:10.625
Well, it wasn't
quite the return I'd imagined.

18:10.708 --> 18:12.541
But now it's…

18:13.416 --> 18:15.416
time to look ahead and move on.

18:15.500 --> 18:19.041
<i>Tell me if I can do anything.</i>
<i>We'd all like to help you.</i>

18:19.958 --> 18:20.916
Thank you.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.583
I'm taking a few days off at home.
Then I'll be ready.

18:24.666 --> 18:28.291
<i>We've also discussed things here,</i>
<i>and I completely agree with you.</i>

18:28.375 --> 18:31.500
<i>I think it's a good idea</i>
<i>for you to take a break.</i>

18:31.583 --> 18:34.625
I agreed with Vogel
that I'll be off until Monday.

18:34.708 --> 18:38.208
<i>We're suggesting</i>
<i>that you stay home for three months.</i>

18:39.666 --> 18:42.083
<i>That'll give us both a chance to think…</i>

18:42.833 --> 18:44.666
<i>Well, to mull things over.</i>

18:45.541 --> 18:47.958
What about the ministerial negotiations?

18:48.041 --> 18:51.208
All the Budget issues we discussed.
That won't work.

18:51.916 --> 18:54.416
<i>Don't worry. We'll find a good solution.</i>

18:56.458 --> 18:58.875
<i>As I said, the most important thing--</i>

18:58.958 --> 19:02.666
So you use me
for sympathy and securing votes,

19:02.750 --> 19:06.375
but if I'm a bit difficult,
I'm booted out? Is that correct?

19:12.916 --> 19:14.458
No, I'm sorry.

19:14.541 --> 19:15.416
I promise I'll…

19:17.458 --> 19:18.708
<i>It's okay, Rosa.</i>

19:19.750 --> 19:24.375
<i>I have another meeting in a minute.</i>

19:24.458 --> 19:27.416
<i>-I need to know if we have a plan.</i>
-Yes, it's fine.

19:28.583 --> 19:32.333
<i>Great. Ask Vogel to stop by later.</i>

19:32.416 --> 19:35.625
<i>We'll sort the details and come up</i>
<i>with a press strategy.</i>

19:36.208 --> 19:37.333
<i>Look after yourself.</i>

19:40.250 --> 19:43.750
I'll go in and get everything sorted.

19:43.833 --> 19:47.208
And in three months,
you'll be so much stronger, Rosa.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.791
Maybe the two of you
should take some time to talk.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.458
Tell me if you need my help.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.083
Should we get started?

20:43.166 --> 20:45.166
-On Kristine's room?
-Yes.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.125
I'll lease a trailer at the gas station.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.041
No, I already took care of that.

20:56.666 --> 20:58.041
I'll pop over and get…

20:59.041 --> 21:01.541
Get some bin liners at the gas station.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.833
MISSING

21:53.750 --> 21:54.583
Steen?

22:54.416 --> 22:55.291
Is anybody there?

23:17.791 --> 23:18.791
<i>That's okay.</i>

23:19.458 --> 23:20.750
<i>You need to practice.</i>

23:45.541 --> 23:47.250
You make me nervous.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.416
Vogel said
you agreed to stay home for a bit.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.333
You have to help me look into something.

23:53.958 --> 23:57.541
We have access to local authority
databases on removals and foster care.

23:57.625 --> 23:58.583
Sure, but…

23:58.666 --> 23:59.833
Rosa?

23:59.916 --> 24:03.500
What are you doing here?
I just sorted everything with the PM.

24:03.583 --> 24:06.750
-I'll explain later.
-Let's go outside. You shouldn't be here.

24:06.833 --> 24:09.916
-Frederik, you don't understand.
-Yes, Rosa. I do.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.166
Your career is in ruins.
I'm doing everything I can to save it.

24:14.666 --> 24:17.583
But it feels like you're doing
everything you can to sabotage it for us.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.166
For us?

24:19.250 --> 24:23.083
With your skills
and the sympathy from voters,

24:23.750 --> 24:25.083
you could go all the way.

24:25.875 --> 24:29.000
-We could go all the way, together.
-Move.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.333
Genz?

24:38.375 --> 24:41.625
Not now. I'm on my way to Jutland,
and I need to finish this.

24:41.708 --> 24:44.958
-It's important. I tried calling you.
-To discuss Bekker?

24:45.041 --> 24:48.708
No, the chestnuts by the bodies
with Kristine Hartung's prints,

24:48.791 --> 24:51.666
are they the ones growing in their garden?

24:51.750 --> 24:54.083
Yes. Horse chestnuts.
We established that already.

24:54.166 --> 24:58.916
So they have to be
from the stall Kristine had by the road.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.583
But is it the same sub-species?

25:01.333 --> 25:02.250
What do you mean?

25:02.333 --> 25:06.000
There should be a report
with information on the chestnuts.

25:06.666 --> 25:07.500
Probably, yes.

25:07.583 --> 25:10.750
It's from a forest botanist
at the faculty of science.

25:10.833 --> 25:12.166
Could you find it for me?

25:14.833 --> 25:16.458
Anything for you.

25:19.333 --> 25:20.166
Hang on.

25:20.250 --> 25:25.125
All right. The chestnuts
found in the Hartung garden are

25:25.208 --> 25:28.083
<i>Aesculus hippocastanum.</i>

25:30.125 --> 25:33.208
And the sub-species
from the first scene with Laura Kjær were

25:33.291 --> 25:37.166
<i>Aesculus hippocastanum… novum.</i>

25:39.666 --> 25:41.666
-<i>Novum</i>? Let me see, please.
-There.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.666
I don't understand. It makes no sense.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.583
It's a different sub-species.

25:45.666 --> 25:48.125
-So…
-What about the other chestnut men?

25:48.208 --> 25:49.625
Anne Sejer-Lassen.

25:49.708 --> 25:50.875
Jessie Kvium.

25:50.958 --> 25:54.083
<i>Aesculus hippocastanum novum</i>.

25:58.708 --> 26:00.125
Does that change anything?

26:01.791 --> 26:05.083
It means that it wasn't
Kristine Hartung's chestnut men

26:05.166 --> 26:06.666
we found at the scenes.

26:06.750 --> 26:10.500
They might've been. She may have used
other chestnuts than those at home.

26:11.375 --> 26:13.833
Speak to Nylander on Monday.

26:13.916 --> 26:16.583
You know
that Nylander thinks the case is closed.

26:17.875 --> 26:20.250
-I'm on my way to Jutland!
-It won't take long.

26:20.333 --> 26:22.083
I'm busy, I can't right now.

26:22.166 --> 26:26.083
Great. Then I'll find somebody else
who can tell me where they grow.

26:26.791 --> 26:29.166
It means that Kristine might be alive.

26:30.916 --> 26:32.875
Stop, wait and…

26:34.625 --> 26:37.416
tell me
what you're proposing we should do.

26:42.875 --> 26:44.708
<i>Møn police, how may I help you?</i>

26:44.791 --> 26:47.250
It's Mark Hess again. Brink?

26:47.333 --> 26:51.416
<i>No, he's still in a meeting.</i>
<i>You'll have to call back on Monday.</i>

27:19.666 --> 27:22.000
POLICE

27:31.625 --> 27:32.750
Open the door, please.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.208
Hess. I'm the one who just called.

27:39.833 --> 27:43.166
You're welcome, and please call back.
Give me a second.

27:45.666 --> 27:47.375
-Yes?
-I need to speak to John Brink.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.458
He's still in a meeting.

27:49.541 --> 27:51.291
Please tell him it's important.

27:51.375 --> 27:54.833
Brink has left for the day.
May I ask what it's regarding?

27:54.916 --> 27:57.041
It's regarding an old case.

27:57.666 --> 27:59.875
If it's old,
surely it can wait until Monday.

27:59.958 --> 28:02.333
Otherwise, Erik can help you. Bye.

28:02.416 --> 28:03.833
Have a great weekend, Brink.

28:09.250 --> 28:11.541
Hey, I'm looking for a murderer.

28:11.625 --> 28:12.458
Great.

28:13.125 --> 28:16.541
I think you met him in 1987
when one of your colleagues was killed.

28:47.833 --> 28:51.458
Our boss, Marius Larsen,
called the station.

28:53.625 --> 28:57.583
He'd gone to the farm
because some of the cows had escaped.

28:58.875 --> 29:00.166
Please, take a seat.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.250
I'll never bloody forget that day.

29:13.333 --> 29:17.041
I'd just turned 29
and was still a bit green.

29:18.208 --> 29:21.125
We arrived at Ørum's farm
to assist Marius.

29:21.875 --> 29:22.708
Ørum?

29:23.583 --> 29:27.000
That was the dad's last name.
The man who owned the farm.

29:28.916 --> 29:31.125
Things were tough for him, I guess.

29:31.708 --> 29:35.541
Maybe that's why the wife decided
they needed to take in foster kids.

29:36.333 --> 29:38.333
You were paid to foster each child.

29:41.250 --> 29:46.708
Everybody knew that Ørum and his wife
weren't particularly family-oriented, but…

29:47.750 --> 29:51.708
the farm had
lots of fresh air, fields and cows,

29:51.791 --> 29:55.625
so we figured
it would be a better life for the children

29:55.708 --> 29:57.333
than what they'd come from.

29:58.333 --> 30:00.291
Who are the two young ones?

30:00.833 --> 30:04.166
They're Ørum's teenage kids.

30:04.750 --> 30:08.041
We found the wife dead in the bathroom.

30:09.541 --> 30:12.375
And I found Marius in the basement.

30:12.458 --> 30:13.833
He was still warm.

30:13.916 --> 30:14.875
And the murderer?

30:15.875 --> 30:20.541
We thought Ørum had done a runner,
but then we found his body in the quarry.

30:21.416 --> 30:26.000
It's located behind the farm.
He'd shot himself with his own shotgun.

30:31.458 --> 30:34.375
How do you know he was the murderer?

30:34.458 --> 30:39.250
Both of his teenagers and the pig
were shot with the same weapon.

30:40.083 --> 30:42.500
We figured he had been overcome

30:43.083 --> 30:44.958
with guilt.

30:45.791 --> 30:46.625
What about?

30:50.208 --> 30:51.125
About…

30:52.083 --> 30:53.500
what they'd done.

30:57.875 --> 31:00.208
What they'd done to the foster kids.

31:00.291 --> 31:01.125
The twins.

31:02.166 --> 31:04.125
We found them in the basement.

31:04.916 --> 31:06.041
A boy and a girl.

31:08.833 --> 31:13.958
I'd heard about them before.
They were my niece's classmates.

31:14.041 --> 31:18.458
But none of us knew
they lived in a dungeon.

31:20.416 --> 31:24.625
Then we found the cupboard
with all the VHS tapes…

31:25.666 --> 31:27.500
with recordings of what they had done.

31:35.250 --> 31:36.458
Poor kids.

31:39.375 --> 31:44.083
You can clearly hear her brother
cry out to the mother

31:44.166 --> 31:46.291
to get her to make it stop, but…

31:47.416 --> 31:48.458
She didn't?

31:50.166 --> 31:51.416
She was the one filming.

31:54.125 --> 31:55.083
And then…

31:57.000 --> 32:03.291
they locked the boy in a room
and asked him to make chestnut men.

32:04.875 --> 32:05.833
Which he did.

32:06.416 --> 32:07.250
Every time.

32:08.500 --> 32:11.583
The basement was full
of goddamn chestnut men.

32:35.041 --> 32:36.791
Why is there no picture of the boy?

32:37.291 --> 32:39.000
-Isn't there?
-No.

32:42.208 --> 32:43.166
I don't understand.

32:44.041 --> 32:47.208
I need to know everything
you know about the boy.

32:48.083 --> 32:49.541
-Sure.
-What was his name?

32:49.625 --> 32:54.166
Toke. The sister was Astrid.
Their last name was Bering.

32:54.250 --> 32:55.875
Toke and Astrid Bering.

32:56.833 --> 32:59.500
Do you know where they are now?
I need to speak to them.

33:01.958 --> 33:03.041
But…

33:04.916 --> 33:06.916
It was more than 30 years ago.

33:07.875 --> 33:09.166
Why stir up the past now?

33:11.750 --> 33:15.500
Because I don't think
Ørum killed your boss back then.

33:17.916 --> 33:19.708
Or his own family, for that matter.

33:24.708 --> 33:25.625
The boy?

33:27.625 --> 33:28.916
You can't be serious.

33:30.625 --> 33:32.500
He was only 11 or 12 years old.

33:40.708 --> 33:42.916
<i>There is no way the file isn't there.</i>

33:43.000 --> 33:46.250
The foster family was Petersen,
at Kirkevej 35, Odsherred.

33:46.333 --> 33:48.666
The father was Paul
and the mom was Kirsten.

33:48.750 --> 33:50.916
They fostered a set of twins.

33:51.000 --> 33:51.833
But…

33:52.583 --> 33:55.958
What case is it exactly?
Do you have the social security number?

33:56.583 --> 33:59.000
Something I can use to search the system?

34:01.958 --> 34:07.166
They fostered another girl too.
261276-8122.

34:10.708 --> 34:13.125
-That's your social security number.
-Enter it.

34:14.541 --> 34:17.333
There was a boy.
He had his sister with him.

34:17.416 --> 34:20.291
Don't you have a name
or something which I--

34:20.375 --> 34:22.083
They were only there a few months.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.291
This might be it. 1985.

34:29.791 --> 34:33.291
Bering, Astrid. And her twin brother.

34:36.458 --> 34:37.291
Toke.

34:38.791 --> 34:41.625
They stayed for two months
before being placed elsewhere.

34:42.458 --> 34:43.875
Where did they go?

34:43.958 --> 34:46.541
What happened to them? Let me do it.

34:48.916 --> 34:50.416
I need to contact them.

35:11.666 --> 35:12.666
What's happening?

35:12.750 --> 35:14.375
Rosa, do I need to do something?

35:14.458 --> 35:16.750
PUNISHMENT
LOCKED UP FOR DAYS

35:16.833 --> 35:19.416
NEGLECT, SEXUAL ABUSE

35:19.500 --> 35:23.000
Rosa, I'm sorry,
the permanent secretary wants to see you.

35:55.333 --> 35:59.041
COME TONIGHT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

36:01.250 --> 36:07.583
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR DAUGHTER

36:21.125 --> 36:24.000
WHERE?

36:28.583 --> 36:31.583
<i>They'd been found abandoned</i>
<i>by the main hospital.</i>

36:31.666 --> 36:35.916
<i>There are some notes on Astrid Bering.</i>
<i>Suicide attempts and drug abuse.</i>

36:36.000 --> 36:40.416
She was discharged from a psychiatric
hospital just over a year ago.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.541
There's no address in her file.

36:42.625 --> 36:43.666
<i>And the boy?</i>

36:44.708 --> 36:47.500
Toke Bering.
That's very odd. We've got nothing.

36:48.250 --> 36:50.833
He hasn't had an address
since the age of 18.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.000
What's going on, Hess?

36:54.750 --> 36:56.416
Abildgård, are you coming?

36:57.041 --> 37:00.916
<i>I can't help you anymore.</i>
<i>We have a press briefing--</i>

37:01.000 --> 37:06.708
<i>Okay, tell me the names of the other</i>
<i>foster families who took them in.</i>

37:06.791 --> 37:09.041
Perhaps one of them
is still in contact with them.

37:12.875 --> 37:15.583
<i>The first foster family</i>
<i>rejected them after two months.</i>

37:15.666 --> 37:18.041
<i>Then they were sent</i> <i>to the Chestnut Farm.</i>

37:18.125 --> 37:20.666
<i>-And then--</i>
<i>-</i>Why were they rejected?

37:21.666 --> 37:22.875
<i>It doesn't specify that.</i>

37:24.333 --> 37:25.416
<i>I have to go.</i>

37:26.708 --> 37:28.583
Give me the name of the first family.

37:29.333 --> 37:30.166
Petersen.

37:30.250 --> 37:34.583
<i>Paul and Kirsten Petersen.</i>
<i>They'd already adopted a daughter. Rosa.</i>

37:38.541 --> 37:39.416
Rosa?

37:42.375 --> 37:43.208
Could that be…

37:49.208 --> 37:53.083
Call Rosa Hartung and ask her
if her maiden name was Petersen.

37:53.166 --> 37:54.833
And if she ever lived with twins.

37:55.375 --> 37:57.041
<i>Yes, I'm on it.</i>

37:59.291 --> 38:02.250
We can't find anything
on Toke Bering, sorry.

38:04.916 --> 38:08.291
How about your niece?
You said they were in the same class.

38:08.375 --> 38:09.208
Yes.

38:10.250 --> 38:11.208
I'll ask my sister.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.333
No, I don't know where she is.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.458
Try her cell.

38:18.208 --> 38:19.958
Then try at the ministry.

38:38.833 --> 38:40.208
Sorry to disturb you.

38:41.291 --> 38:42.916
My name's Steen Hartung.

38:45.583 --> 38:47.000
This is my daughter.

38:47.916 --> 38:49.791
She disappeared last year.

38:53.666 --> 38:56.000
Perhaps you saw something.

38:56.958 --> 38:57.791
Anything?

38:59.333 --> 39:01.791
She was on her way home
from the sports grounds.

39:02.833 --> 39:06.416
She was wearing
a red windbreaker and blue jeans.

39:08.375 --> 39:09.416
Like that.

39:11.583 --> 39:12.625
Hang on.

39:13.375 --> 39:14.458
I've seen you before.

39:15.041 --> 39:16.958
Where the hell have I seen you before?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.416
I've seen you before too.

39:20.541 --> 39:25.625
You came to the door yesterday
asking the exact same questions.

39:28.375 --> 39:29.208
I'm so sorry.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.166
Perhaps you should just go home.

39:33.750 --> 39:35.083
Go home?

39:37.250 --> 39:39.500
Do you think I'd be standing here

39:39.583 --> 39:41.916
if there was somewhere
I'd actually want to be?

39:44.416 --> 39:45.250
Do you?

39:46.916 --> 39:49.750
I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. Sorry.

39:50.833 --> 39:52.833
Why don't I drive you home?

39:58.333 --> 39:59.791
Let me get the car keys.

40:14.458 --> 40:15.291
Rosa?

40:16.708 --> 40:18.958
Dad?

40:19.041 --> 40:20.958
Hi, kiddo.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.875
-Where's Mom?
-I don't know.

40:23.958 --> 40:26.666
I've tried calling her all day.
The car's gone.

40:27.291 --> 40:28.333
What's this?

40:35.625 --> 40:39.125
I found it in the living room.
The front door was wide open.

40:44.375 --> 40:45.583
Dad, is something wrong?

41:10.666 --> 41:12.666
<i>Off you go to play again, sweetie.</i>

41:16.833 --> 41:18.041
What's wrong, honey?

41:21.833 --> 41:23.500
It's just Toke…

41:24.833 --> 41:25.916
What did Toke do?

41:31.041 --> 41:33.541
You need to tell me if something is wrong.

41:36.125 --> 41:37.291
Did he do something?

41:39.708 --> 41:41.041
All right, what did he do?

41:53.458 --> 41:55.375
Are you sure that's all true?

41:56.958 --> 41:59.833
It's super important
that you're not making this up.

42:01.958 --> 42:03.166
Honey, come here.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.958
<i>Please know</i>
<i>that we fully understand your decision.</i>

42:20.041 --> 42:22.541
-Thank you.
-How's your daughter feeling?

42:22.625 --> 42:24.375
Okay, given the circumstances.

42:24.458 --> 42:26.000
Thankfully so.

42:26.083 --> 42:28.500
-Do you know where they'll go?
-To Møn, I think.

42:29.416 --> 42:30.625
They'll be okay.

42:30.708 --> 42:32.208
Thanks for all your help.

43:01.041 --> 43:04.583
NUMBER WITHHELD
TURN OFF PHONE AND DUMP IT

43:08.875 --> 43:11.125
OFF

43:20.833 --> 43:25.125
Do you think she might
have a list of names from her class?

43:25.208 --> 43:27.333
Johanne, come on, goddammit.

43:27.416 --> 43:30.000
-We haven't got all day.
-I'm coming.

43:30.083 --> 43:33.541
I needed to turn off the oven.
The kids and the grandkids are coming.

43:33.625 --> 43:38.541
This is the first time the grandkids
are "trick-or-tweeting" or whatever it is.

43:40.333 --> 43:41.458
Do you want some cake?

43:41.541 --> 43:42.625
No, thanks.

43:44.041 --> 43:48.833
Your daughter was in the same class
as Toke and Astrid Bering then?

43:48.916 --> 43:50.416
Yes, my daughter, Iben.

43:50.500 --> 43:54.458
Terrible business.
It really affected all the kids back then.

43:54.541 --> 43:57.583
Iben lives in Norway now
working in a hotel.

43:57.666 --> 44:01.333
It's just the boys and their kids tonight.

44:01.416 --> 44:05.541
John said they had an alumni party
a few years back?

44:05.625 --> 44:09.166
Johanne, we need a list of names
of Iben's classmates

44:10.041 --> 44:11.458
and their contact details.

44:11.541 --> 44:14.750
I know we have one,
because we kept all of Iben's things.

44:14.833 --> 44:16.458
Let's see here.

44:17.250 --> 44:18.250
It's in here.

44:18.958 --> 44:21.750
It must be somewhere around here.

44:23.791 --> 44:25.583
It's just magazines and stuff.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.208
Of course I can't find it now.

44:33.041 --> 44:34.000
Sorry, but…

44:34.083 --> 44:37.291
I wonder if Iben has it,
or if it might be in the attic

44:37.375 --> 44:40.375
or in the garage from when we redecorated.

44:40.458 --> 44:42.833
-Let me have a look.
-Don't push me.

44:42.916 --> 44:45.750
You said on the phone
you had a copy of the list.

44:47.291 --> 44:50.625
We're here now, and you don't have it.

44:50.708 --> 44:54.666
-We came all this way for it.
-You're welcome to stay for dinner.

44:54.750 --> 44:56.375
What's for dinner then?

44:56.458 --> 44:59.208
Rolled shoulder of pork,
but without the prune stuffing…

44:59.291 --> 45:01.958
-Who's that in the pictures?
-Herbs from the garden…

45:02.916 --> 45:03.791
Look…

45:03.875 --> 45:06.416
-Who's that in the picture?
-That's Iben.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.000
And her class.

45:09.083 --> 45:11.000
Look, there's Toke. There.

45:11.708 --> 45:15.291
-That was her prom at Møllevang School.
-That can't be right.

45:18.333 --> 45:20.375
-It's him. I remember him clearly--
-Toke?

45:20.458 --> 45:22.291
Yes, I remember it quite clearly.

45:22.375 --> 45:25.166
Iben was surprised
when he turned up at the prom.

45:26.083 --> 45:28.541
He'd left the school
years before that, you see.

45:30.208 --> 45:32.208
He only stayed for an hour or so.

45:32.875 --> 45:34.041
Nobody said anything.

45:36.625 --> 45:41.291
Everybody felt sorry for those kids
with everything that happened at Ørum's.

45:42.958 --> 45:46.500
<i>Chestnut man</i>

45:46.583 --> 45:51.625
<i>Come on inside</i>
<i>Do you have some chestnuts</i>

45:51.708 --> 45:54.541
<i>For me today</i>

45:58.916 --> 46:00.041
<i>Let's start the briefing.</i>

46:00.875 --> 46:02.875
I don't know
how much information you will--

46:02.958 --> 46:04.666
Sorry. Just a sec.

46:04.750 --> 46:08.583
I don't know what you intend to say,
but mention the things I underlined.

46:08.666 --> 46:10.833
-Nylander, you've an important call.
-Not now.

46:10.916 --> 46:13.791
-I have a press briefing.
-You need to take it.

46:13.875 --> 46:15.625
You'll regret it if you don't.

46:15.708 --> 46:16.708
We're ready.

46:16.791 --> 46:18.791
-Nylander.
-<i>Listen carefully.</i>

46:18.875 --> 46:21.583
-Hess.
-<i>Get Genz, and get him now!</i>

46:21.666 --> 46:22.583
<i>Do you understand?</i>

46:44.250 --> 46:46.333
POLICE - SIMON GENZ

46:51.916 --> 46:52.916
Shit!

46:53.958 --> 46:54.791
<i>Nylander.</i>

46:54.875 --> 46:56.875
What's up? Have you got him?

46:56.958 --> 46:58.416
<i>No, he left.</i>

46:59.333 --> 47:01.666
<i>-Left for where?</i>
-Nobody knows.

47:01.750 --> 47:04.250
<i>He left with Thulin</i> <i>a few hours ago.</i>

47:04.333 --> 47:05.416
-Thulin?
-<i>Yes.</i>

47:05.500 --> 47:08.833
The others say they had a meeting.
We found her phone in a bin.

47:08.916 --> 47:10.541
SIX MISSED CALLS

47:12.416 --> 47:16.583
<i>Fuck! Genz has no use for Thulin.</i>
<i>Check if he dropped her off.</i>

47:16.666 --> 47:18.250
<i>Check her address. Find her!</i>

47:33.125 --> 47:35.000
-It should be here.
-Here?

47:37.458 --> 47:40.416
No, we've been all over Møn already.

47:42.375 --> 47:45.750
The biologist says you can find
the chestnut in three specific places.

47:45.833 --> 47:47.541
And we've seen those three places.

47:52.458 --> 47:55.166
I need to go to Jutland.
I'll drop you off at the station.

47:55.250 --> 47:57.416
Can we drive back via the other route?

47:58.208 --> 47:59.708
No, it's such a detour.

47:59.791 --> 48:00.750
Let's just try.

48:19.250 --> 48:22.625
Careful not to break it.
It's evidence, isn't it?

48:26.208 --> 48:27.416
Your weapon is in there.

48:28.250 --> 48:31.083
Gosh! I really need
to lock the glove compartment.

48:32.875 --> 48:36.125
-Sorry to have wasted your time.
-That's okay.

48:37.041 --> 48:39.583
I was going this way anyway.

48:40.583 --> 48:41.500
More or less.

48:47.625 --> 48:48.875
It was fun to her.

48:50.125 --> 48:53.375
-Your daughter. She seems so nice.
-Yeah.

48:55.875 --> 48:56.791
How was the party?

48:59.750 --> 49:01.333
Fine, I think.

49:02.291 --> 49:05.375
-You think? Weren't you there?
-No, I left.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.500
-I'm here.
-But you can make it up to her.

49:09.416 --> 49:10.875
If you want to be a good mom.

49:13.333 --> 49:14.416
A good mom?

49:15.416 --> 49:16.750
What the hell is that?

49:17.750 --> 49:18.916
Someone who understands

49:19.000 --> 49:22.416
that children are precious
and you need to take care of them.

49:22.500 --> 49:24.166
Yeah, just like a good dad.

49:25.125 --> 49:26.041
Where's my phone?

49:26.125 --> 49:29.833
-I had it at your office.
-Moms are different.

49:30.750 --> 49:33.583
Ultimately, a mom ensures
that her child is okay.

49:34.333 --> 49:35.708
That's a load of nonsense.

49:35.791 --> 49:38.750
It's not just down to the mom
to make sure the child's okay.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.166
Part of the job is to work and make money.

49:43.333 --> 49:46.208
No, because the child
is all about basic instincts.

49:46.875 --> 49:51.250
A dad's dispensable.
The child is attached to the mom, right?

49:51.333 --> 49:55.583
She needs to be there for her child.
Otherwise, she's not doing her job.

49:55.666 --> 49:57.250
Of course, she needs to,

49:57.333 --> 50:00.541
but a good mom also knows
when her child needs her.

50:00.625 --> 50:01.708
Then she'll be there.

50:07.208 --> 50:09.000
But she has her grandpa, Aksel.

50:16.250 --> 50:18.208
How do you know his name's Aksel?

50:21.208 --> 50:22.166
You told me.

50:25.791 --> 50:27.000
May I borrow your phone?

50:27.833 --> 50:29.125
I'm not sure where it is.

50:30.708 --> 50:32.375
-Could you pull over?
-Sure.

50:32.458 --> 50:34.166
Pull over. Stop!

50:34.250 --> 50:35.125
Wait.

51:03.750 --> 51:05.208
Naia, we're in a hurry.

51:07.791 --> 51:09.000
Bring the bag with you.

51:30.416 --> 51:31.250
Come on.

51:37.541 --> 51:38.791
This could be the one.

51:51.416 --> 51:52.875
Weren't you going home to Le?

51:52.958 --> 51:55.375
I just need to see something.
Five minutes.

51:56.458 --> 51:59.458
-It looks like there's a farm over there.
-Great.

52:05.666 --> 52:06.791
If you insist.

52:13.875 --> 52:14.958
Then let's do it.

53:44.750 --> 53:50.000
