07:02.389 --> 07:05.957
I mean look at it, just shattered
all the ice, it's everywhere.

07:05.959 --> 07:10.429
What ends up happening, right is that
molten metal hits the ice and it boils it.

07:11.297 --> 07:15.000
It boils it, creates steam,
steam expands, it explodes.

07:16.969 --> 07:19.271
<i>The big railway car, obviously,
had something melting in it,</i>

07:19.273 --> 07:21.606
something hot, right?

07:21.608 --> 07:25.844
And when that hot metal or whatever it was,
poured out into the snow or into the ice,

07:25.846 --> 07:28.280
it created a huge burst of
steam, and off it went, kaboom!

07:28.282 --> 07:29.447
Kaboom.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.984
<i>[Matt] That's what I call
"letting off some steam".</i>

<i>[narrator] But, Brian Wolshon,

<i>does not cause a fireball, like

07:49.703 --> 07:52.437
In this transition
of frozen water into steam,

<i>[narrator] Coming up,

08:15.161 --> 08:16.428
<i>[Nick] This seems

<i>[narrator] And, are Seattle's

It's possible, that the heat

11:53.612 --> 11:54.979
How did all of these
power poles,

11:55.013 --> 11:56.614
all come down at the same time?

11:59.085 --> 12:03.388
<i>[narrator] David Wallace discovers
that Seattle may seem like a modern city,</i>

12:03.390 --> 12:07.759
<i>but it has an ancient secret
hidden under the metropolis.</i>

12:07.761 --> 12:11.896
<i>Below the surface, is a
network of 19th century streets,</i>

12:11.898 --> 12:16.334
<i>condemned in 1907,
for fear of bubonic plague.</i>

12:17.336 --> 12:19.571
<i>The disease, better known
as the Black Death,</i>

12:19.573 --> 12:24.476
<i>that wiped out 25 million
Europeans in the 14th century.</i>

12:24.478 --> 12:27.812
<i>[David] Really makes you wonder
as you're driving over these streets,</i>

12:27.814 --> 12:30.682
running above the ground and you
have all these underground tunnels,

12:30.684 --> 12:31.916
that's beneath you.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.518
And if they start collapsing,

12:33.520 --> 12:35.954
what would happen to you?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.489
<i>[narrator] Some of these
underground plague chambers</i>

12:37.491 --> 12:43.428
<i>have been accessed to create
illegal gambling dens and flop houses.</i>

12:43.430 --> 12:46.631
<i>[narrator] If this dangerous subterranean
honeycomb is beginning to crumble,</i>

12:46.633 --> 12:52.170
<i>the effects at modern street
level, could be devastating.</i>

12:52.172 --> 12:56.341
It's entirely possible that this has
destabilized the ground above it

12:56.343 --> 12:57.775
to such an extent,

12:57.777 --> 13:01.246
that with a hard rainfall, you
suddenly get power lines collapsing.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.621
<i>[narrator] Studying the footage,
entomologist Kevin Kasky,</i>

13:09.623 --> 13:13.892
<i>suspects the polls themselves
may hold a clue.</i>

13:13.894 --> 13:17.162
<i>[Kevin] These utility poles
have a dark brown color.</i>

13:17.164 --> 13:18.763
They appear to be made of wood.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.999
Makes me wonder,

13:21.001 --> 13:23.568
is there some sort
of critter infesting the pole,

13:23.570 --> 13:26.404
that could cause
this kind of damage.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.973
<i>[narrator] Seattle is known
as the Emerald City</i>

13:28.975 --> 13:31.442
<i>for its lush, evergreen forests.</i>

13:31.444 --> 13:35.180
<i>But Kasky discovers
that's changing fast.</i>

13:36.715 --> 13:40.552
<i>[Kevin] The city is quickly
becoming the "brown rusty city",</i>

13:40.554 --> 13:43.421
because the surrounding
forests are being devastated

13:43.423 --> 13:46.758
by infestations
of the bark beetle.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.593
<i>[narrator] There are over
600 species</i>

13:48.595 --> 13:51.396
<i>of the bark beetle in America.</i>

13:51.398 --> 13:55.700
<i>These tiny terrorists mostly
feed on dead or dying trees,</i>

13:55.702 --> 13:57.869
<i>but some will attack
healthy ones,</i>

13:57.871 --> 14:00.238
<i>with devastating effects.</i>

14:01.974 --> 14:03.842
<i>[Kevin] The bark beetle
burrows in</i>

14:03.844 --> 14:06.644
to the bark of a tree
and lays its eggs.

14:06.646 --> 14:10.648
And therefore, the larva
then start to eat the tree,

14:10.650 --> 14:14.419
<i>exposing it to outside
elements such as disease.</i>

14:14.421 --> 14:17.622
As the climate warms,
the bark beetle has spread

14:17.624 --> 14:22.193
north from California up
into the lush green of Seattle.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.531
<i>[narrator] But engineer,
Brian Wolshon,</i>

14:26.533 --> 14:28.399
<i>finds these poles fell
in a place,</i>

14:28.401 --> 14:31.336
<i>where a potentially
cataclysmic geological fault</i>

14:31.338 --> 14:33.838
<i>was recently discovered.</i>

14:33.840 --> 14:38.843
This area of Washington State sits on
what's known as the Cascadia Fault Line,

14:38.845 --> 14:45.016
<i>which was virtually unknown to
science until the last 30 or 40 years.</i>

14:46.886 --> 14:49.320
Could, what we see in
these video clips, actually be

14:49.322 --> 14:51.422
<i>the result of an earthquake?</i>

14:55.828 --> 15:00.331
[narrator] <i>The last major seismic
shock a magnitude 6.8 quake,</i>

15:00.333 --> 15:04.736
<i>shakes Seattle
on February 28, 2001.</i>

15:04.738 --> 15:11.676
<i>It causes $1 billion of damage to roads
and buildings, and injures 400 people,</i>

15:11.678 --> 15:15.680
<i>but it's nothing compared
to what's coming.</i>

15:15.682 --> 15:19.784
<i>The Cascadia subduction zone
runs for 700 miles</i>

15:19.786 --> 15:22.620
<i>along the Pacific Northwest
Coast.</i>

15:22.622 --> 15:26.724
<i>[man 3] Every major city in
this area of the United States</i>

15:26.726 --> 15:30.328
has been built without
knowledge of this fault line,

15:30.330 --> 15:33.131
putting them directly
in the line of fire.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.501
<i>[narrator] Scientists believe
tension has been building</i>

15:36.503 --> 15:43.408
<i>in the Cascadia subduction zone
since the last mega quake in 1700.</i>

15:43.410 --> 15:48.446
The mother of all earthquakes has
long since overdue on the Pacific coast.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.950
<i>When it happens,
it is not going to be pretty.</i>

15:54.653 --> 15:58.389
<i>[narrator] First, seismic
waves will destroy bridges.</i>

15:59.992 --> 16:04.262
<i>And shake unreinforced
buildings off their foundations.</i>

16:05.331 --> 16:08.933
The ground under
Seattle will liquefy.

16:08.935 --> 16:13.338
It'll cause dams to breach. It
will cause fire. It'll cause flooding.

16:16.008 --> 16:19.277
After the shaking,
a 700 miles Tsunami

16:19.279 --> 16:22.046
will blast the western seaboard.

16:22.848 --> 16:27.552
<i>[narrator] A wall of water,
anywhere from 20 to 100 feet high</i>

16:27.554 --> 16:31.422
<i>will devastate
around 140,000 square miles.</i>

16:33.258 --> 16:35.727
<i>Everything, west of Interstate 5</i>

16:35.729 --> 16:38.463
<i>will be what the authorities
call, "Toast".</i>

16:38.465 --> 16:41.699
<i>As the massive wave of water
recedes,</i>

16:41.701 --> 16:45.269
<i>it will leave an unrecognizable
landscape in its wake.</i>

16:46.338 --> 16:49.907
The entire region will be in
an utter state of devastation.

16:49.909 --> 16:52.844
<i>[narrator] Experts fear
that the cascadia catastrophe</i>

16:52.846 --> 16:55.279
<i>will be worse
than any earthquake</i>

16:55.281 --> 16:58.082
<i>in the United States'
recorded history.</i>

16:58.084 --> 17:02.020
<i>The odds of the big one
happening in the next 50 years</i>

17:02.022 --> 17:04.522
<i>are estimated to be
one in three.</i>

17:04.524 --> 17:08.693
We've all been sort of waiting
with bated breath for a long time.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.395
<i>And one of these days,
it's going to happen</i>

17:10.397 --> 17:14.565
and it will devastate
the city of Seattle.

17:14.567 --> 17:19.270
<i>[narrator] No major earthquake is registered
on the day the power lines collapse.</i>

17:21.507 --> 17:24.809
<i>But regular miners shaking
from the cascadia fault</i>

17:24.811 --> 17:29.113
<i>known as episodic tremors
happen every few years.</i>

17:30.849 --> 17:32.650
Could an episodic tremor
be strong enough

17:32.652 --> 17:35.486
to cause those utility poles
to collapse?

17:35.488 --> 17:40.725
If what we're seeing here is the
result of these episodic tremors,

17:40.727 --> 17:47.231
could that also be a forecast
that the big one is very near?

17:47.233 --> 17:49.767
<i>[narrator] But not even
an episodic tremor</i>

17:49.769 --> 17:52.136
<i>was recorded
in Tukwila, that day.</i>

17:52.471 --> 17:54.138
This has to be something else.

17:55.774 --> 17:59.043
<i>[narrator] Coming up, could
all of America's power lines</i>

17:59.045 --> 18:01.512
<i>be about to come crashing down?</i>

18:01.514 --> 18:06.551
We can't fix this fast, we're
looking at the dark ages reappearing.

18:06.553 --> 18:11.823
<i>[narrator] And in the Arctic, a
weird whirlpool of living creatures.</i>

18:11.825 --> 18:14.392
It looks like they're under
some sort of trance.

18:21.733 --> 18:26.270
<i>[narrator] In Seattle, 26 utility
poles mysteriously slammed down,</i>

18:26.272 --> 18:29.006
<i>trapping a driver
and his passenger.</i>

18:32.578 --> 18:38.583
<i>Engineer, David Wallace suspects
that the polls themselves are at fault.</i>

18:38.585 --> 18:41.452
<i>[David] A power pole, is
basically, constructed out of a tree</i>

18:41.454 --> 18:43.688
and over time, this tree
is going to start rotting.

18:43.690 --> 18:47.358
It's going to get weak and
it can eventually, fall over.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.895
Your average utility pole
lasts about 45 years.

18:50.897 --> 18:54.966
<i>But the climate in the
Puget area is mild and wet.</i>

18:54.968 --> 18:57.869
And this just increases
the chances for rot.

18:57.871 --> 19:02.406
<i>[narrator] One rotten pole can
become the weak link in a whole chain.</i>

19:02.408 --> 19:06.777
Utility lines like this
are usually 35 feet tall.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.613
<i>As you can imagine,
it's like a lever.</i>

19:08.615 --> 19:12.583
<i>[David] You have these power cables
that are pulling on broke directions.</i>

19:12.585 --> 19:15.453
You add a little bit of wind
or any other motion to it,

19:15.455 --> 19:17.722
<i>that adds these extra forces
which can overwhelm</i>

19:17.724 --> 19:20.191
<i>the strength of the pole
and you get a snap.</i>

19:23.629 --> 19:26.797
<i>[narrator] Investigators
discover that winds that day</i>

19:26.799 --> 19:30.902
<i>are blowing at 30 miles per
hour with gale-force gusts</i>

19:30.904 --> 19:33.604
<i>While rainfall
softens the ground.</i>

19:33.606 --> 19:37.341
<i>Utility company engineers
later discover</i>

19:37.343 --> 19:42.280
<i>that six of the falling polls
show advanced internal decay.</i>

19:42.282 --> 19:44.215
<i>[Martin] Got a bit of a
perfect storm going on here.</i>

19:44.217 --> 19:49.220
All of these circumstances conspired
to collapse, these power lines.

19:49.222 --> 19:54.492
<i>[narrator] More checks reveal some 6,000
other polls that need urgent attention.</i>

19:54.494 --> 19:58.829
So if we can't fix this fast, we're
looking at the dark ages reappearing.

19:58.831 --> 20:03.968
This problem is not unique to Seattle.
This problem affects the entire country.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.404
<i>They're nearing the end
of their life expectancy</i>

20:06.406 --> 20:10.241
and there are millions of miles
of them in the United States.

20:10.609 --> 20:13.377
<i>[Rachel] These polls weigh
over 700 pounds,</i>

20:13.379 --> 20:17.148
and when they fall, it's like
getting hit by a flattering ram.

20:18.483 --> 20:21.919
<i>[narrator] It takes emergency
crews an hour to turn off the power</i>

20:21.921 --> 20:25.456
<i>and cut the unfortunate couple
from their wrecked car.</i>

20:25.458 --> 20:29.160
<i>They escaped
with severe bruising.</i>

20:29.162 --> 20:32.697
I mean these guys got away,
that's some lucky people right there.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.433
They say, the most dangerous
thing on the road is other drivers.

20:35.435 --> 20:39.170
Well, it seems like on this
day, it was a power line pole.

20:41.673 --> 20:46.811
<i>[narrator] Now, the Lovozero
Tundra, in Russian Lapland,</i>

20:46.813 --> 20:50.081
<i>a pristine wilderness,
north of the Arctic circle.</i>

20:54.353 --> 20:57.822
<i>April 30, 2018,</i>

20:57.824 --> 21:02.960
<i>a drone captures a mysterious
spinning mass in the barren snowfields.</i>

21:03.729 --> 21:07.265
You can see this circle,
it's kicking up snow.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.934
<i>[Kevin] What is that circle?</i>

21:10.135 --> 21:11.769
It is huge.

21:11.771 --> 21:16.741
<i>[narrator] As the drone gets
closer, it reveals a herd of reindeer.</i>

21:16.743 --> 21:20.745
It's like a tornado of
animals. It's kind of surreal.

21:20.747 --> 21:24.415
Why are all those animals
circling around each other?

21:24.417 --> 21:26.751
<i>[Jayde] It's like they have
a hive mind.</i>

21:26.753 --> 21:29.553
Is there something wrong
with the reindeer?

21:29.555 --> 21:31.956
Is this mother nature gone mad?

21:34.693 --> 21:36.427
<i>[narrator] Biologist,
Jayde Lovell studies</i>

21:36.429 --> 21:39.830
<i>the dizzying rotation
of the reindeer herd.</i>

21:39.832 --> 21:43.534
<i>She has seen this kind of
behavior before in other species</i>

21:43.536 --> 21:45.436
<i>and it's not a good sign.</i>

21:47.005 --> 21:51.075
We know that some animals
will walk around in circles

21:51.077 --> 21:54.912
if they're sick, if they have a brain
infection or a parasitic infection.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.047
<i>[narrator] In some wild animals,</i>

21:56.049 --> 21:59.750
<i>walking in circles
is a sign of rabies or worse.</i>

21:59.752 --> 22:02.386
In the Northeast region
of the United States,

22:02.388 --> 22:07.458
there has been a noted rise
in moose's dying unexpectedly.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.861
And this has been linked to
a parasitic worm in the brain

22:10.863 --> 22:15.933
<i>that causes the moose to
just wander aimlessly in circles.</i>

22:15.935 --> 22:18.736
<i>[narrator] The parasite,
which is killing the moose,</i>

22:18.738 --> 22:21.405
<i>Parelaphostrongylus tenuis,</i>

22:21.407 --> 22:24.208
<i>normally lives
in white-tailed deer.</i>

22:25.577 --> 22:27.945
<i>[Kevin] When the parasite
gets into a moose,</i>

22:27.947 --> 22:32.049
the worms, move up
the moose's spine,

22:32.051 --> 22:34.685
making its way to the brain
devouring the gray matter,

22:34.687 --> 22:39.223
slowly driving the moose insane.

22:40.692 --> 22:44.428
The moose begins walking in
circles and they do this without eating.

22:44.430 --> 22:47.998
So eventually,
the moose expires.

22:52.671 --> 22:54.872
This parasite is becoming
more common

22:54.874 --> 22:56.841
because with rising
temperatures,

22:56.843 --> 22:58.476
it's allowing
the white-tailed deer

22:58.478 --> 23:02.279
to move into areas
previously uninhabitable.

23:02.281 --> 23:07.418
<i>Could this strange reindeer behavior
be caused by parasites on the brain?</i>

23:11.656 --> 23:15.359
<i>[narrator] Parasitic brain worms
don't just attack wild animals.</i>

23:16.395 --> 23:19.063
<i>Humans can become victims, too.</i>

23:19.831 --> 23:21.766
We know that
it's certainly possible

23:21.768 --> 23:25.369
for brain parasites
from animals to infect humans.

23:25.371 --> 23:28.406
So it makes you wonder when
you see this reindeer behavior,

23:28.408 --> 23:33.144
if there's anything that the humans
in the area should be worried about?

23:33.146 --> 23:36.680
<i>[narrator] Suicidal thoughts
among reindeer herders in Sweden,</i>

23:36.682 --> 23:39.650
<i>are twice as high as among

23:39.652 --> 23:42.920
<i>A hidden epidemic
of brain eating parasites</i>

23:42.922 --> 23:47.291
<i>could slowly be driving the
Arctic human population mad.</i>

23:47.293 --> 23:49.860
This is even worse
than being a zombie.

23:49.862 --> 23:55.266
Imagine a whole village of people
walking around in circles until death.

23:56.468 --> 23:58.369
<i>[narrator] But biologist
Carin Bondar,</i>

23:58.371 --> 24:02.506
<i>does not believe

24:02.508 --> 24:04.742
<i>[Carin] These rangers are
actually, moving quite quickly</i>

24:04.744 --> 24:07.778
<i>and in a really
coordinated fashion,</i>

24:07.780 --> 24:10.648
which makes me think that
they aren't confused at all.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.249
And this isn't a parasite.

24:14.019 --> 24:15.719
<i>But why are they doing this?</i>

24:19.558 --> 24:25.663
<i>[narrator] Coming up, is this spinning
disk of deer a way of fighting humans?</i>

24:25.665 --> 24:29.200
<i>[Ashanti] Imagine being
plowed down by by 100 reindeer,</i>

24:29.202 --> 24:31.769
you'd be pummeled
like a sack of potatoes.

<i>[narrator] And a shape-shifting
riddle in the skies over Germany.</i>

24:36.409 --> 24:39.710
This fits the description
of what one might imagine

an alien craft from another
planet would look like.

<i>[narrator] On the remote

<i>reindeer are filmed spinning in what

24:58.730 --> 25:01.599
But Ashanti Davis,
suspects these reindeer

25:01.601 --> 25:04.535
<i>are acting in a logical
and coordinated way</i>

25:04.537 --> 25:08.005
<i>to fight off a stealthy
and cunning enemy.</i>

25:08.673 --> 25:12.409
Large herds of animals often
stampede as a form of defense.

25:12.411 --> 25:17.615
This large mass makes them
harder to target by predators.

25:17.617 --> 25:22.186
<i>[narrator] Schools of fish are known
to swim in circles to confuse attackers.</i>

25:23.355 --> 25:27.224
<i>Birds circle in the air
for the same reason.</i>

25:27.226 --> 25:31.595
The reindeer want to stay
together so they stampede in a circle.

25:31.597 --> 25:35.666
<i>Creating almost like
a reindeer cyclone.</i>

25:35.668 --> 25:37.668
<i>[narrator] But what could be
attacking these reindeer</i>

25:37.670 --> 25:40.938
<i>here in the high Arctic Tundra?</i>

25:42.474 --> 25:47.411
<i>Biologist Jayde Lovell discovers,
Vikings 1,000 years ago,</i>

25:47.413 --> 25:51.982
<i>used to encounter these
bizarre reindeer cyclones.</i>

25:51.984 --> 25:54.618
<i>An effective defense against
human hunters.</i>

25:54.620 --> 25:57.821
It's possible that this
is warming in a circle,

25:57.823 --> 26:01.358
may have been an evolved
threat response behavior

26:01.360 --> 26:04.395
to being hunted by Vikings.

26:04.397 --> 26:07.998
<i>They would put their vulnerable
members in the center of the herd</i>

26:08.000 --> 26:11.602
and the strongest members on the
outside and run at this huge speed.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.738
And you can imagine as a
Viking with maybe only a sword,

26:14.740 --> 26:17.474
<i>or a spear would be
pretty difficult to take down</i>

26:17.476 --> 26:21.946
a bunch of stampeding
swarming reindeer.

26:21.948 --> 26:27.351
<i>[narrator] Reindeer weigh up to
660 pounds and can run 50 mph.</i>

26:28.853 --> 26:29.987
<i>During the spring,</i>

26:29.989 --> 26:35.259
<i>they can mass in super herds
of 500,000 individuals.</i>

26:37.028 --> 26:38.462
<i>So when they feel under threat,</i>

26:38.464 --> 26:41.999
<i>the danger to humans
is very real.</i>

26:43.468 --> 26:47.605
These are huge creatures and like
any of the large game in the north,

26:47.607 --> 26:52.009
<i>reindeers are big enough
to trample a human to death.</i>

26:52.811 --> 26:55.746
<i>[Ashanti] Imagine being
plowed down by 100 reindeer,</i>

26:55.748 --> 26:58.515
all of that power
moving through those hooves

26:58.517 --> 27:02.853
would mean you'd be pummeled
like a sack of potatoes.

27:02.855 --> 27:09.059
<i>[narrator] Forget Bambi, worldwidem
deer are a doe-eyed danger to humans.</i>

<i>and alligators combined.</i>

<i>But nothing in this drone

27:25.745 --> 27:26.810
<i>that might be a potential threat</i>

27:26.812 --> 27:30.280
<i>to these rapidly
rotating reindeer.</i>

27:30.282 --> 27:32.650
<i>Investigators can only speculate</i>

27:32.652 --> 27:36.153
<i>about what is sending them
into a spin.</i>

27:36.855 --> 27:38.689
<i>[Carin] They may be sensing
danger.</i>

27:38.691 --> 27:42.626
Something that we humans
can't see or feel.

27:42.628 --> 27:47.364
Whatever is happening,
the reindeer are not happy.

27:47.366 --> 27:51.035
<i>They are ready to do whatever
it takes to protect the herd.</i>

27:55.407 --> 27:59.209
<i>[narrator] Now, Ruckersdorf,

28:11.557 --> 28:14.692
What exactly
are we looking at here?

28:14.694 --> 28:19.596
It looks like something metallic
because the sunlight is glinting off it.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.432
<i>[Patrick] It's moving
in such a strange way.</i>

28:21.434 --> 28:22.966
I can't quite make out
its shape.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.602
It seems to be
shifting constantly.

28:25.604 --> 28:29.206
[narrator] <i>This is no
ordinary flying object.</i>

28:29.208 --> 28:33.277
It's not like a aircraft where
you're going to have wings.

28:33.279 --> 28:38.615
It's not like a drone, where you're
going to have propellers going about.

28:38.617 --> 28:43.921
<i>[narrator] Weirdest of all, it seems
to change its appearance as it hovers.</i>

28:43.923 --> 28:45.656
<i>[Nick] I don't know of anyone
who's developed an aircraft</i>

28:45.658 --> 28:48.926

<i>[woman 3] There's no engine
sound.</i>

28:50.763 --> 28:53.430
I can't tell what this is.

28:53.432 --> 28:56.366
This fits the description
of what one might imagine

28:56.368 --> 29:00.003
an alien craft, from another
planet would look like.

29:01.539 --> 29:05.609
<i>[narrator] Historian, Craig

<i>It might explain what this
mysterious object could be.</i>

29:14.353 --> 29:17.287
Germany during this period
was a hotbed of UFO activity.

29:17.289 --> 29:21.725
Lots of sightings on both
sides of the iron curtain.

<i>[narrator] The declassified CIA

<i>[Craig] He didn't know
what it was.</i>

29:38.711 --> 29:41.245

a frying pan.

<i>[narrator] A crude sketch
shows what Link claims he saw,</i>

29:44.717 --> 29:47.985
<i>including the craft's
two occupants.</i>

29:47.987 --> 29:49.553
Oscar described how
the center part of the craft

29:49.555 --> 29:51.522
could move with ease,

29:51.524 --> 29:54.458
which could explain that once it's
up in the air it could change shape.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.728
Mr. Linker seeing this
thought to himself,

29:57.730 --> 30:00.564
I might be seeing something
top secret and really sensitive.

30:00.566 --> 30:04.101
He thought, what he saw was a
top-secret soviet super weapon.

30:14.212 --> 30:16.346
<i>the EKIP.</i>

30:16.348 --> 30:22.186
It looks like a Buck Rogers concept
of what space travel would look like.

30:22.188 --> 30:25.522
<i>It doesn't look like it has
wings that will support lift.</i>

30:25.524 --> 30:29.760
It uses some other system
to achieve controlled flight.

30:29.762 --> 30:34.665
<i>[narrator] Soviet engineers, claim the
disc-shaped fuselage acts like a single wing</i>

30:34.667 --> 30:38.836
<i>providing almost
all of the EKIP's lift.</i>

30:38.838 --> 30:43.307
<i>Jets which provide thrust
are located inside the craft.</i>

30:45.643 --> 30:48.445
It can supposedly travel
long ranges with heavy cargo

30:48.447 --> 30:51.315
and doesn't need
a runway to land.

30:51.317 --> 30:56.053
<i>[narrator] But descriptions of the EKIP
never mentioned shape shifting abilities.</i>

30:57.789 --> 31:00.591
<i>[Martin] It might be that what
we're looking at in this footage</i>

31:00.593 --> 31:03.493
is the 21st-century adaptation

31:03.495 --> 31:07.364
<i>of something first created
by the Soviet Union.</i>

31:07.366 --> 31:10.267

what we're seeing in the sky?

31:19.678 --> 31:22.679
It's very possible
that the shape shifting object

31:22.681 --> 31:26.483
maybe using a memory metal
construction technique like this.

31:26.485 --> 31:29.386
<i>[narrator] And is this film
proof,</i>

31:29.388 --> 31:32.723

31:43.868 --> 31:45.269
<i>[narrator] Over Germany,</i>

31:45.271 --> 31:47.838
<i>an unexplained
aerial object hovers</i>

31:47.840 --> 31:50.407
<i>and appears

31:51.576 --> 31:53.744
<i>Aerospace engineer
Nick Householder</i>

31:53.746 --> 31:56.580
<i>is struck by the way
the objects casing</i>

31:56.582 --> 31:59.650
<i>seems to have no clearly
defined shape.</i>

31:59.652 --> 32:04.721
<i>[Nick] The way the aircraft is
changing and morphing implies</i>

32:04.723 --> 32:09.826
that the skin of the craft has some
sort of unusual physical properties.

32:09.828 --> 32:12.763
<i>This reminds me of something
called memory metal.</i>

32:12.765 --> 32:16.400
Metals that can change shape
almost at will.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.669
<i>[narrator] NASA's scientists
are experimenting</i>

32:18.671 --> 32:20.470
<i>with the memory metal Nitinol,</i>

32:20.472 --> 32:23.540
<i>an alloy of Nickel and Titanium.</i>

32:23.542 --> 32:29.579
<i>Nitinol is said to be the secret
sauce in NASA's next mars rover.</i>

32:29.581 --> 32:34.685
<i>Nitinol wheels will bend around
obstacles on the planet's rocky surface.</i>

32:34.687 --> 32:36.620
<i>And then revert
to their original form</i>

32:36.622 --> 32:39.456
<i>to carry on the robot's mission.</i>

32:39.458 --> 32:43.694
This is Nitinol wire, it looks
like any other wire you might see,

32:43.696 --> 32:48.398
but it has a special arrangement of
its atoms where when you deform it,

32:48.400 --> 32:51.702
it actually remembers the
original position it was in,

32:51.704 --> 32:53.904
so that no matter
how much you change it,

32:53.906 --> 32:55.906
it can still go back.

32:55.908 --> 32:58.976
But what takes it back
is interesting.

32:58.978 --> 33:01.745
You can use either heat
or electricity

33:01.747 --> 33:04.548
to free up the atoms and
allow them to realign themselves

33:04.550 --> 33:07.184
to their original orientation.

33:07.186 --> 33:10.253
So, if I take this lighter
and apply a little bit of heat,

33:11.889 --> 33:15.025
the wire jumps back
to its original shape.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.094
Straight as an arrow.

33:21.399 --> 33:24.334
I'm going to attempt to replicate
what we're seeing in the video

33:24.336 --> 33:29.473
by embedding some Nitinol into this
piece of Mylar making a hybrid material.

33:29.475 --> 33:34.478
We'll have the flexibility and the
shimmery-ness of the Mylar material

33:34.480 --> 33:39.950
mixed with the rigidity and
shape-changing properties of the Nitinol.

33:39.952 --> 33:42.586
<i>[narrator] Nick creates
the original shape to be flat.</i>

33:42.588 --> 33:44.421
Now it's ready to go.

33:44.423 --> 33:47.891
<i>[narrator] He deforms the
crystal lattice of the wires</i>

33:47.893 --> 33:50.994
<i>and this time he uses
electricity to energize them,</i>

33:52.230 --> 33:55.999
<i>allowing their atoms
to shift and reform.</i>

33:56.001 --> 33:59.236
<i>Moving back into their
original crystalline structure.</i>

34:00.438 --> 34:04.174
[Nick] We have a hybrid
shape shifting material here.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.910
It's very possible that the
shape-shifting object maybe

34:06.912 --> 34:10.447
using a memory metal
construction technique like this.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.683
<i>[narrator] The possibilities
of memory metal</i>

34:13.685 --> 34:16.820
<i>are only beginning
to be explored.</i>

34:16.822 --> 34:19.456
<i>[Nick] NASA has used
memory metals to make wings</i>

34:19.458 --> 34:21.792
<i>that can deform and change
shape during the flight.</i>

34:21.794 --> 34:26.296
Nitinol has also seen some
uses in adaptive robotics.

34:26.298 --> 34:29.099
You can imagine this being
used like a muscle

34:29.101 --> 34:33.203
that is deformed and then when
a little bit of electricity is applied,

34:33.205 --> 34:35.972
<i>it returns
to its original shape.</i>

34:35.974 --> 34:37.474
This is science fiction,
made real.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.675
And just imagine,

34:38.677 --> 34:41.111
if this is the stuff that
we're allowed to know about

34:41.113 --> 34:43.580
how far the tech has actually
gone behind the scenes.

34:43.582 --> 34:46.683
What if the next evolution
is that we can make

34:46.685 --> 34:51.521
<i>an aircraft that like the T-1000
flow into a different shape.</i>

34:51.523 --> 34:54.257
<i>Maybe there's some super
advanced research laboratory</i>

34:54.259 --> 34:58.228
that has broken through
and achieved that.

34:58.230 --> 35:03.100
<i>[narrator] But even a craft like this
would make noise as its engines roar.</i>

35:04.769 --> 35:09.406
<i>Within seconds, the mysterious
shifting shape vanishes into the sky</i>

35:09.408 --> 35:12.042
<i>without any perceptible sound.</i>

35:12.910 --> 35:14.578
<i>Without further evidence,</i>

35:14.580 --> 35:16.713
<i>investigators can only speculate</i>

35:16.715 --> 35:20.951
<i>about who is flying it,
over a civilian neighborhood.</i>

35:21.886 --> 35:23.553
The troubling thing is we
still don't know who built this

35:23.555 --> 35:25.689
<i>or for what purpose?</i>

35:25.691 --> 35:29.392
Maybe that's something that we
should take pause and be concerned with.

35:32.830 --> 35:37.167
<i>[narrator] Now Swindon, an ancient

and she looks around and
seems to take no notice of the cat.

37:35.721 --> 37:38.488
So either she's not surprised
at all or

37:38.490 --> 37:41.391

year before this film was taken.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.756
<i>His name was Blackjack.</i>

38:12.758 --> 38:14.424
<i>And according to the lady,</i>

38:14.426 --> 38:18.828
this was his favorite
spot on the couch.

38:18.830 --> 38:23.700
<i>[narrator] Pet owners often feel the
presence of a beloved deceased companion.</i>

38:23.702 --> 38:26.670
<i>One former feline friend
is even said to haunt</i>

38:26.672 --> 38:29.406
<i>one of America's
most famous buildings.</i>

38:29.408 --> 38:33.576
Ghost cats have been reported
stalking the US Capitol, in Washington DC.

38:33.578 --> 38:37.380
<i>And people have even reported
seeing cat paw prints on the floor.</i>

38:39.517 --> 38:42.419
<i>[narrator] Psychologists say
encountering a ghostly version</i>

38:42.421 --> 38:45.155
<i>of a dead pet
is a hallucination.</i>

38:45.756 --> 38:49.092
<i>But this apparent apparition
on the video,</i>

38:49.094 --> 38:53.029
<i>can't be a figment of its
former owners imagination.</i>

38:53.764 --> 38:55.865
Ghost cat or no cat.

38:55.867 --> 38:59.436
Something very strange
happened in that colorful living room.

39:01.739 --> 39:03.139
[narrator]
<i>Physicist Chad Orzel</i>

39:03.141 --> 39:06.710
<i>believes the answer can be
found in the data on the footage.</i>

39:06.712 --> 39:08.478
There's a combination of events

39:08.480 --> 39:11.414
that lead to that cat shape
appearing on the sofa.

39:12.450 --> 39:15.018
<i>The light coming through
the window looks bright,</i>

39:15.020 --> 39:18.121
<i>but the time on the footage
says it's 9:30 p.m.</i>

39:18.123 --> 39:19.022
So it's evening.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.857
<i>The footage
is also black and white,</i>

39:20.859 --> 39:23.693
which tells me the camera is in
some sort of night vision mode.

39:23.695 --> 39:27.364
Seeing the world through
infrared light.

39:27.366 --> 39:29.699
<i>[narrator] Everything in the
universe with a temperature</i>

39:29.701 --> 39:34.971
<i>over 450 degrees below zero
emits infrared radiation.</i>

39:36.640 --> 39:40.443
<i>Humans and other warm-blooded
animals can't see it.</i>

39:40.445 --> 39:42.412
<i>But we can feel it as heat.</i>

39:43.547 --> 39:45.915
<i>[Chad] Colored objects
look the way they do</i>

39:45.917 --> 39:48.718
because they're reflecting
light that our eyes can see.

39:48.720 --> 39:52.856
The same things will reflect
infrared light differently

39:52.858 --> 39:57.260
and will appear different
colors under infrared illumination.

39:57.262 --> 39:59.462
<i>[narrator] Orzel sets up
an experiment</i>

39:59.464 --> 40:03.533
<i>to discover if a shift from
recording infrared to visible light,</i>

40:03.535 --> 40:07.637
<i>might explain the curious
case of the couch cat.</i>

40:07.639 --> 40:10.573
I've got a similar home
security webcam here

40:10.575 --> 40:12.675
with an automatic
night vision mode,

40:12.677 --> 40:16.813
and on the couch, I've placed
a camouflage print blanket,

40:16.815 --> 40:21.050
<i>a solid blue t-shirt
and a stuffed black dog.</i>

40:21.852 --> 40:24.387
What we're going to do
is switch off the lights,

40:24.389 --> 40:26.589
the camera will go
into its night vision mode

40:26.591 --> 40:29.526
and we'll see how different
these three things look

40:29.528 --> 40:33.363
under infrared light
compared to the visible light.

40:33.365 --> 40:37.700
<i>[narrator] Orzel's camera
reveals a magical metamorphosis.</i>

40:37.702 --> 40:43.072
<i>When recording infrared light, the
appearance of the objects change.</i>

40:44.141 --> 40:46.376
<i>[Chad] This three materials
that looks so different</i>

40:46.378 --> 40:50.513
<i>under visible light look almost
exactly the same in infrared.</i>

40:50.515 --> 40:53.783
<i>The camouflage print on the
blanket has completely vanished.</i>

40:53.785 --> 40:58.555
<i>The solid blue shirt is almost
the same color as the blanket,</i>

40:58.557 --> 41:01.224
<i>and even our little black dog
is looking much lighter,</i>

41:01.226 --> 41:04.327
<i>nearly the same color
as the other two objects.</i>

41:06.597 --> 41:09.766
<i>[narrator] It's possible that a
similar effect in the British living room</i>

41:09.768 --> 41:13.336
<i>conceals the ghost cat
under infrared light.</i>

41:14.538 --> 41:17.407
<i>And reveals it on the couch
in daylight mode.</i>

41:18.843 --> 41:21.644
This is definitely
a light bulb moment.

41:21.646 --> 41:24.914
<i>In the black and white
night vision mode,</i>

41:24.916 --> 41:27.383
<i>you can't pick up the differences
between these materials,</i>

41:27.385 --> 41:31.387
<i>so, it looks almost like
there's nothing there.</i>

41:31.389 --> 41:34.757
<i>As the lights come on, the
camera readjusts it's settings</i>

41:34.759 --> 41:37.126
<i>and all of the dark objects
reappear.</i>

41:37.695 --> 41:40.029
<i>It's almost like magic.</i>

41:42.233 --> 41:45.568
<i>[narrator] Infrared camera
technology seems to explain</i>

41:45.570 --> 41:49.672
<i>this ghost cat, but the owner
still believes the video is proof</i>

41:49.674 --> 41:55.211
<i>of an animal afterlife and
her beloved Blackjack is back.</i>

41:55.213 --> 42:00.183
Maybe this woman's old cat decided to
cash in on one more of those nine lives.
