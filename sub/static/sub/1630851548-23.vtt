10:01.233 --> 10:01.666
BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT IT

10:01.733 --> 10:04.933
WOULDN'T BE.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.700
>> THERE'S A HUGE HISTORY OF

10:07.766 --> 10:10.066
CRIME GOING BACK EVEN BEFORE

10:10.133 --> 10:15.100
THIS SHOW.

10:15.166 --> 10:16.500
>> Bill: WOW.

10:16.566 --> 10:17.966
>> EVEN THE ABBOTT AND COSTELLO

10:18.033 --> 10:19.900
MOVIES WERE ABOUT SOMEBODY

10:19.966 --> 10:21.066
GETTING MURDERED BY A

10:21.133 --> 10:21.400
FRANKENSTEIN.

10:21.466 --> 10:22.400
>> Bill: THERE'S SO MANY

10:22.466 --> 10:24.700
PODCASTS ABOUT MURDER.

10:24.766 --> 10:26.233
>> THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING

10:26.300 --> 10:27.866
ABOUT THE SHOW, IT COMBINES THE

10:27.933 --> 10:30.266
OBSESSION WITH CRIME AND MURDER

10:30.333 --> 10:30.600
AND PODCASTS.

10:30.666 --> 10:34.566
>> THE SHOW ACTUALLY CAME UP TWO

10:34.633 --> 10:37.533
YEARS AGO AND PODCASTS IN THAT

10:37.600 --> 10:39.533
INTERIM GREW AND THE PODCASTS

10:39.600 --> 10:40.700
WERE ALWAYS A BIT A PART OF IT

10:40.766 --> 10:44.533
AND NOW WE ARE WRITING A WAVE OF

10:44.600 --> 10:46.933
PODCASTS LIGHT.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.466
>> Bill: WHAT YOU MAKE A BET?

10:48.533 --> 10:50.100
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE

10:50.166 --> 10:52.466
UNDER 40, IT SEEMS LIKE THEIR

10:52.533 --> 10:53.800
ATTENTION SPAN IS EITHER THREE

10:53.866 --> 10:57.066
SECONDS OR FOUR HOURS.

10:57.133 --> 10:57.700
BECAUSE THE PODCASTS GO ON TOO

10:57.766 --> 10:59.733
LONG FOR ME.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.433
>> I CAN TELL YOU, PODCASTS ARE

11:02.500 --> 11:04.066
PERFECT FOR DOING TWO THINGS AT

11:04.133 --> 11:04.266
ONCE.

11:04.333 --> 11:07.366
I HAVE A BICYCLE AND A PODCAST

11:07.433 --> 11:09.100
I'M DOING TWO THINGS AT ONCE BUT

11:09.166 --> 11:10.200
IF I WERE GOING TO SIT AND

11:10.266 --> 11:10.833
LISTEN TO A PODCAST I WOULD BE

11:10.900 --> 11:15.066
ABLE TO DO IT.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.100
ALSO YOU LISTEN TO A PODCAST

11:16.166 --> 11:18.766
WHILE YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR

11:18.833 --> 11:21.266
CHILD.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.833
[LAUGHTER]

11:23.900 --> 11:24.100
[APPLAUSE]

11:24.166 --> 11:25.766
OR WHEN I'M TALKING TO MARTY, I

11:25.833 --> 11:27.166
SAY IF HE WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING

11:27.233 --> 11:30.433
I PUT A PODCAST ON.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.633
>> Bill: LET'S TALK

11:31.700 --> 11:32.233
GENERATIONS.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.266
YOUR COSTAR IN THIS IS

11:34.333 --> 11:36.033
SELENA GOMEZ WHO IS FANTASTIC, I

11:36.100 --> 11:36.300
KNOW.

11:36.366 --> 11:38.966
IF YOU KNOW HER MUSIC?

11:39.033 --> 11:39.966
>> ABSOLUTELY >> Bill: I WANT

11:40.033 --> 11:42.733
TO LOVE YOU LIKE A LOVE SONG --

11:42.800 --> 11:43.633
I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW MUSIC

11:43.700 --> 11:45.566
THAT SOUNDS OF IT COULD'VE BEEN

11:45.633 --> 11:47.500
A HIT IN ANY DECADE, THAT'S ONE,

11:47.566 --> 11:49.666
THAT'S A GREAT RECORD.

11:49.733 --> 11:52.566
>> SHE'S SO GOOD IN THE SHOW AND

11:52.633 --> 11:53.466
SHE'S FANTASTIC, WE GET ALONG

11:53.533 --> 11:56.866
GREAT AND SHE'S A GREAT ACTRESS.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.933
AND SHE PUTS ON HER PILLS IN THE

11:59.000 --> 11:59.166
MORNING.

11:59.233 --> 12:01.133
THE FIRST DAY OF SHOOTING -- I

12:01.200 --> 12:04.166
DON'T KNOW IF SHE KNEW, SHE SAID

12:04.233 --> 12:09.566
I'M SUCH A BIG FAN JUDY DENCH!

12:09.633 --> 12:15.700
>> Bill: SEE WHAT I MEAN!

12:15.766 --> 12:16.933
I LOVE THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN THE

12:17.000 --> 12:18.366
MILLENNIAL AND TWO BOOMERS,

12:18.433 --> 12:19.800
THESE GENERATIONS ALWAYS SEEMS

12:19.866 --> 12:21.866
TO BE FEUDING, SOMEHOW GEN X

12:21.933 --> 12:22.533
WHICH ARE IN THE MIDDLE GET A

12:22.600 --> 12:25.133
PASS ON THIS AT THE BOOMERS ARE

12:25.200 --> 12:26.333
ALWAYS HEARING IT FROM THE

12:26.400 --> 12:27.200
MILLENNIALS THAT WE RUINED THE

12:27.266 --> 12:30.500
WORLD, WE TOOK ALL THE JOB --

12:30.566 --> 12:34.600
>> HAS IT ALL WOULD BEEN THAT

12:34.666 --> 12:35.700
WAY?

12:35.766 --> 12:37.933
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT DOING THE

12:38.000 --> 12:41.800
SMOTHERS BROTHERS.

12:41.866 --> 12:44.366
>> THAT'S WHY MY HEART BROKE

12:44.433 --> 12:46.000
BECAUSE THEY SAID YOU WERE ON

12:46.066 --> 12:47.233
THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS STAGE,

12:47.300 --> 12:52.100
THAT'S THE CAROL BURNETT STAGE!

12:52.166 --> 12:52.666
ANYWAY --

12:52.733 --> 12:53.066
[LAUGHTER]

12:53.133 --> 12:54.300
WHEN I FIRST STARTED WRITING

12:54.366 --> 12:56.366
HERE I WAS 21 YEARS OLD OF THE

12:56.433 --> 12:58.066
REASON I GOT HIRED AT 21 YEARS

12:58.133 --> 12:59.633
OLD, THE MANTRA OF THE DAY WAS

12:59.700 --> 13:01.533
NEVER TRUST ANYONE OVER 30.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.533
THE WANTED YOUNG WRITERS.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.833
THE WRITERS THEY HAD WERE GREAT,

13:05.900 --> 13:08.366
THEY WROTE FOR JACK BENNY AND OF

13:08.433 --> 13:09.133
COURSE THEY LOOKED AT US

13:09.200 --> 13:12.000
SIDEWAYS, THESE KIDS COMING IN

13:12.066 --> 13:15.366
AND THEY WERE TOLERANT AND THEY

13:15.433 --> 13:17.066
WERE GREAT WRITERS.

13:17.133 --> 13:18.766
>> Bill: THAT SHOW, DO YOU

13:18.833 --> 13:22.066
REMEMBER THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS

13:22.133 --> 13:22.266
SHOW?

13:22.333 --> 13:26.633
IT SHOULD BE, THEY SHOULD HAVE A

13:26.700 --> 13:28.733
LEGACY RATER THAN THEY HAVE COME

13:28.800 --> 13:29.266
AND CHANGE THE DISCOURSE.

13:29.333 --> 13:32.333
>> IT WAS BRILLIANT.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.866
>> Bill: I WANT TO ASK ABOUT

13:33.933 --> 13:35.500
AGES AND BECAUSE YOU ARE OLD AND

13:35.566 --> 13:40.833
I'M OLD, IT PISSES ME OFF THAT

13:40.900 --> 13:42.900
THIS IS THE LAST ACCEPTABLE

13:42.966 --> 13:44.433
PREJUDICE, PEOPLE CAN ALWAYS SAY

13:44.500 --> 13:45.433
THEY DON'T LIKE ANYTHING YOU DO,

13:45.500 --> 13:47.800
YOUR OLD.

13:47.866 --> 13:49.600
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT BECAUSE

13:49.666 --> 13:50.433
I'M STARTING TO LOOK LIKE THE

13:50.500 --> 13:57.500
GUY FROM UP?

13:57.566 --> 14:00.500
[LAUGHTER]

14:00.566 --> 14:00.766
[APPLAUSE]

14:00.833 --> 14:01.766
IT STARTS WITH THE GLASSES.

14:01.833 --> 14:03.133
>> I GOT NEW FRAMES AND I

14:03.200 --> 14:05.700
REALIZED AS I WAS ABOUT TO WALK

14:05.766 --> 14:06.333
OUT HERE --

14:06.400 --> 14:07.466
>> Bill: AS WITH SO MANY

14:07.533 --> 14:08.466
THINGS, YOU WERE STILL AHEAD OF

14:08.533 --> 14:10.733
YOUR TIME AND PRESCIENT BECAUSE

14:10.800 --> 14:12.866
YOU HAD THE WHITE HAIR WHEN YOU

14:12.933 --> 14:16.266
WERE THREE.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.300
>> I NEVER THOUGHT OF DYING MY

14:17.366 --> 14:20.100
HAIR ONCE.

14:20.166 --> 14:21.100
>> Bill: YOU LOOK LIKE STEVE

14:21.166 --> 14:24.033
MARTIN, LIKE HE ALWAYS LOOKED,

14:24.100 --> 14:26.233
THAT'S A TRICK.

14:26.300 --> 14:33.700
>> DO YOU THINK I LOOK LIKE HIM?

14:33.766 --> 14:35.866
>> Bill: TO BE THE ONLY ANSWER

14:35.933 --> 14:36.766
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GETTING

14:36.833 --> 14:40.900
YOUNGER IS TO LEAN INTO IT.

14:40.966 --> 14:42.900
KIDS ATTACK ME, YOUR OLD AND I'M

14:42.966 --> 14:46.900
LIKE YEAH, BUT YOU'RE STUPID.

14:46.966 --> 14:48.266
MAYBE THAT'S WHY I KNOW SOME

14:48.333 --> 14:49.833
SHIT AND YOU DON'T.

14:49.900 --> 14:52.400
>> THAT'S LIKE US BACKSTAGE.

14:52.466 --> 14:59.766
>> I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

14:59.833 --> 15:02.900
RIGHT I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD

15:02.966 --> 15:03.300
HIDE ANYTHING --

15:03.366 --> 15:05.533
>> THEN WHY DID YOU GO INTO MAKE

15:05.600 --> 15:05.800
UP?

15:05.866 --> 15:08.466
>> ON THE WAY HERE, I SMILED AND

15:08.533 --> 15:10.433
SOMETHING FELL OFF AND THEY

15:10.500 --> 15:12.600
CAUGHT IT AND THEY HAD TO PATCH

15:12.666 --> 15:13.900
IT UP.

15:13.966 --> 15:14.433
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

15:14.500 --> 15:14.700
[LAUGHTER]

15:14.766 --> 15:17.866
[APPLAUSE]

15:17.933 --> 15:19.033
>> I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT

15:19.100 --> 15:23.400
IT BUT WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT

15:23.466 --> 15:23.833
SITUATION.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.266
I THINK ABOUT IT AS A PERSON BUT

15:25.333 --> 15:27.800
NOT AS A CELEBRITY OR AN ACTOR.

15:27.866 --> 15:28.366
>> Bill: IT'S SOMETHING THEY

15:28.433 --> 15:29.933
ATTACK YOU WITH.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.466
ANYTHING YOU DO THAT DOESN'T

15:33.533 --> 15:35.566
MEASURE UP, THEY WILL SAY WELL

15:35.633 --> 15:36.400
NOW HE'S TOO OLD TO.

15:36.466 --> 15:38.666
>> WE GET THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT

15:38.733 --> 15:39.300
IN FRIENDLY CONVERSATION WITH

15:39.366 --> 15:42.600
SELENA SHE WILL GO -- IT'S EVEN

15:42.666 --> 15:43.466
IN THE SHOW A LITTLE BIT,

15:43.533 --> 15:46.533
WRITTEN IN.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.933
SHE INTRODUCED US TO A LOT OF

15:49.000 --> 15:50.133
THINGS.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.600
>> Bill: SONGS.

15:52.666 --> 15:54.000
>> TOLD THE STORY -- WHEN SHE

15:54.066 --> 15:57.500
WAS TEACHING READING ALL THE

15:57.566 --> 16:01.866
LYRICS TO WAP.

16:01.933 --> 16:05.800
>> Bill: TO WET ASS PUSSY?

16:05.866 --> 16:07.333
>> I WAS AWARE THAT KIND OF

16:07.400 --> 16:08.133
MATERIAL WAS OUT THERE I DIDN'T

16:08.200 --> 16:10.266
KNOW IT WAS THE NUMBER ONE HIT.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.066
SHE'S READING HIM ALL THE LYRICS

16:12.133 --> 16:16.133
AND THEN I'M CALLED TO THE SET

16:16.200 --> 16:22.466
AND STEVE COMES UP SAYS I JUST

16:22.533 --> 16:23.533
LEARNED THREE NEW VERSES TO TOP

16:23.600 --> 16:25.000
HAT AND TAILS!

16:25.066 --> 16:26.600
>> Bill: WHAT DID YOU TAKE

16:26.666 --> 16:27.400
AWAY FROM WHAT SHE TAUGHT YOU?

16:27.466 --> 16:32.366
>> WHAT USED TO BE --

16:32.433 --> 16:34.233
>> Bill: I MEAN ABOUT THE

16:34.300 --> 16:36.333
PUSSY ITSELF.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.933
>> THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.700
>> Bill: YOUNG COMICS, WHAT

16:42.766 --> 16:51.700
CAN WE DO TO H STOP -- HELP THE.

16:51.766 --> 16:52.566
[LAUGHTER]

16:52.633 --> 16:53.700
WHEN WE WERE STARTING UP, THERE

16:53.766 --> 16:55.700
WAS A PLACE CAN BE BAD, WORK AND

16:55.766 --> 16:56.900
IT COULD BE BAD NOW?

16:56.966 --> 17:01.600
>> THEY ALSO HAVE A SHORTER

17:01.666 --> 17:02.466
PRESENTATION.

17:02.533 --> 17:04.433
THEY MIGHT BE 30 SECONDS, YOU

17:04.500 --> 17:05.166
GET A CHANCE TO TEST SOMETHING

17:05.233 --> 17:07.733
AND SEE IF IT WORKS.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.766
I HAVE A RULE, I NEVER SAY "WHEN

17:09.833 --> 17:12.300
WE WERE KIDS, WE WERE SO MUCH

17:12.366 --> 17:14.600
BETTER."

17:14.666 --> 17:16.200
I HEARD THAT WHEN I WAS A KID

17:16.266 --> 17:17.866
AND I VOWED NOT TO DO IT BECAUSE

17:17.933 --> 17:18.600
LOOK AT ALL THE TALENT THAT'S

17:18.666 --> 17:22.533
OUT THERE.

17:22.600 --> 17:28.533
>> ARE CLUBS -- ARE THEY STILL

17:28.600 --> 17:28.766
POPULAR?

17:28.833 --> 17:29.566
>> Bill: THEY STILL ARE BUT

17:29.633 --> 17:31.933
PEOPLE GO IN THERE WITH PHONES

17:32.000 --> 17:33.033
AND IF YOU TRY SOMETHING AND

17:33.100 --> 17:35.833
IT'S A LITTLE OUT-OF-BOUNDS IT

17:35.900 --> 17:37.700
MAY BE ON TWITTER, YOU MAY BE

17:37.766 --> 17:39.766
CANCELED BEFORE YOUR CAREER GETS

17:39.833 --> 17:40.233
STARTED.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.433
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN, WE COULD BE

17:42.500 --> 17:42.966
BAD IN WAYS AND TEST THE

17:43.033 --> 17:46.100
BOUNDARIES AND NO ONE KNEW UNTIL

17:46.166 --> 17:47.066
WE GOT HIGHER UP AND STILL DID

17:47.133 --> 17:53.266
IT AND GOT IN TROUBLE.

17:53.333 --> 17:53.533
[LAUGHTER]

17:53.600 --> 17:55.633
>> I WAS A LITTLE BIT WITH CHRIS

17:55.700 --> 17:56.733
ROCK ON THE OSCARS AND WE WENT

17:56.800 --> 17:58.433
TO THE COMEDY STORE AND RUN IT

17:58.500 --> 18:00.700
AND WE WANTED TO DO THAT AND

18:00.766 --> 18:01.333
SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO FILM IT

18:01.400 --> 18:02.900
AND THEY WILL POST IT AND IT

18:02.966 --> 18:03.266
WILL BE RUINED.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.300
HE SAID THAT WILL BE GREAT.

18:05.366 --> 18:09.100
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY.

18:09.166 --> 18:09.466
GOOD PUBLICITY.

18:09.533 --> 18:10.600
>> Bill: EXCEPT IF THEY HAD

18:10.666 --> 18:13.333
HEARD THE JOKES BEFORE, NOT SO

18:13.400 --> 18:14.233
MUCH.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.233
I COULD TALK TO YOU WILL NOT

18:15.300 --> 18:17.466
COME I JUST WANTED TO SAY ONE OF

18:17.533 --> 18:19.066
THE GREAT THINGS BUT WATCHING

18:19.133 --> 18:24.733
YOU, I THINK AUDIENCES -- WE

18:24.800 --> 18:26.200
LOVE IT WHEN WE SEE PEOPLE WHO

18:26.266 --> 18:27.100
WE LOVE AND WE CAN TELL THAT

18:27.166 --> 18:30.900
THERE GENUINE FRIENDS.

18:30.966 --> 18:33.533
WE SEE IT WITH BANDS, WE HATE IT

18:33.600 --> 18:35.266
WHEN FANS BREAK UP.

18:35.333 --> 18:38.100
>> I HATED HEARING THAT THE

18:38.166 --> 18:38.833
EAGLES DIDN'T GET ALONG.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.066
>> Bill: SIMON AND GARFUNKEL,

18:40.133 --> 18:43.766
WHY CAN'T YOU LOVE EACH OTHER?

18:43.833 --> 18:49.433
>> AND THE BEATLES BREAKING UP.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.966
>> Bill: EXACTLY, I JUST WANT

18:51.033 --> 18:56.266
TO SAY I CAN SEE THE AFFECTION

18:56.333 --> 18:56.733
AND IT'S CONTAGIOUS.

18:56.800 --> 19:02.733
>> I LOVE THIS WHITE-HAIRED GUY!

19:02.800 --> 19:03.100
STEVE!

19:03.166 --> 19:06.233
BILL CAN SEE THE AFFECTION ON

19:06.300 --> 19:06.500

21:01.400 --> 21:02.400
IN VIETNAM BUT AT LEAST IN

21:02.466 --> 21:04.666
VIETNAM, IT TOOK A COUPLE OF

21:04.733 --> 21:05.266
YEARS, AFTER THE UNITED STATES

21:05.333 --> 21:07.433
PULLED OUT.

YEARS, 20, 100, WHEN THEY GET

21:34.833 --> 21:36.233

OF COURSE THE LIVES OF THE MOST

IT'S BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THE

22:20.100 --> 22:20.300

23:07.300 --> 23:09.233
OF NORMALCY TO A COUNTRY THAT

23:09.300 --> 23:11.200

RIGHT?

23:20.866 --> 23:23.300
WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW?

24:15.800 --> 24:19.033
IT'S TEN CITIES, 12 CITIES

IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THUS.

25:36.933 --> 25:37.600
JOE BIDEN, HE WAS AGAINST THIS

25:37.666 --> 25:41.466
BACK IN 2009.

25:41.533 --> 25:45.533
IT WAS OBAMA AND BUSH WHO

25:45.600 --> 25:46.700
THOUGHT OH, SERGE, WE'LL SURGE,

25:46.766 --> 25:47.266
LIKE THAT WAS EVER GOING TO

25:47.333 --> 25:50.200
CHANGE ANYTHING.

25:50.266 --> 25:51.966
THE CHOICE WAS EITHER STAY THERE

25:52.033 --> 25:56.766
FOREVER TO PROTECT WOMEN OR

25:56.833 --> 25:57.966
THIS.

25:58.033 --> 25:58.600
>> THOSE THINGS CAN WORK IN THE

25:58.666 --> 26:04.833
SHORT TERM, THEY DID IN IRAQ BUT

26:04.900 --> 26:06.800
THE PROBLEM IS WE CAN WIN WARS

26:06.866 --> 26:07.833
IF IT JUST MEANS BEATING BAD

26:07.900 --> 26:09.033
GUYS AND THAT'S IT BUT BEATING

26:09.100 --> 26:10.466
BAD GUYS AND STAYING AROUND AND

26:10.533 --> 26:11.533
KEEPING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND

26:11.600 --> 26:13.433
MAKING SURE IT BLOSSOMS INTO

26:13.500 --> 26:15.500
SOCIETY, THIS IS NOT 1945, THAT

26:15.566 --> 26:16.366
WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN AND

26:16.433 --> 26:19.066
YOU SEE THESE LISTS, SOME OF

26:19.133 --> 26:20.200
THEM ARE HEARTENING AND

26:20.266 --> 26:21.300
IMPRESSIVE ABOUT WHAT HAS

26:21.366 --> 26:22.833
HAPPENED IN AFGHANISTAN OVER THE

26:22.900 --> 26:24.466
PAST 20 YEARS, THE NUMBER OF

26:24.533 --> 26:25.866
GIRLS WHO GO TO SCHOOL -- YES,

26:25.933 --> 26:26.466
IT'S ALL GONE NOW, IT'S ALL

26:26.533 --> 26:28.800
GOING AWAY.

26:28.866 --> 26:31.200
I'M GLAD THERE WAS A GENERATION

26:31.266 --> 26:32.033
FOR 20 YEARS NEVER KNOWING THE

26:32.100 --> 26:32.633
TALIBAN BUT THEY ARE ABOUT TO

26:32.700 --> 26:35.800
KNOW WHAT AGAIN.

26:35.866 --> 26:36.600
>> Bill: WHEN THEY VOTED ON

26:36.666 --> 26:38.100
THIS IN 2001, THERE WAS ONE

26:38.166 --> 26:43.066
PERSON IN CONGRESS, BARBARA LEE.

26:43.133 --> 26:46.033
ONE PERSON, LIKE THE MOVIE 12

26:46.100 --> 26:46.666
ANGRY MEN.

26:46.733 --> 26:48.200
SOMETIMES JUST ONE PERSON IS

26:48.266 --> 26:48.766
RIGHT AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS

26:48.833 --> 26:52.466
FUCKING WRONG.

26:52.533 --> 26:54.366
>> WHAT A GREAT WOMAN OF

26:54.433 --> 26:54.600
COURAGE.

26:54.666 --> 26:55.533
>> Bill: SHE VOTED AGAINST THE

26:55.600 --> 26:56.966
WAR.

26:57.033 --> 27:01.400
>> THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT HAS TO

27:01.466 --> 27:03.366
SHORE UP SOME OF THIS

27:03.433 --> 27:03.966
RESPONSIBILITY, THEY ARE

27:04.033 --> 27:04.200
CORRUPT.

27:04.266 --> 27:05.833
>> Bill: IT'S OVER, THERE IS

27:05.900 --> 27:07.466
NO MORE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND

27:07.533 --> 27:09.600
THERE NEVER COULD BECOME A

27:09.666 --> 27:10.800
CLIENT STATE RULED 7,000 MILES

27:10.866 --> 27:11.900
AWAY FROM PEOPLE WITH A

27:11.966 --> 27:14.833
DIFFERENT CULTURE AND RELIGION,

27:14.900 --> 27:16.866
AFTER VIETNAM, WHY WE THOUGHT WE

27:16.933 --> 27:18.100
COULD JUST -- WE DON'T LEARN.

27:18.166 --> 27:20.400
WE JUST DON'T LEARN.

27:20.466 --> 27:27.800
THIS THING ABOUT THE MONEY, IT'S

27:27.866 --> 27:29.333
LIKE NOW WE HAVE A $1 TRILLION

27:29.400 --> 27:32.333
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, WE NEED TO

27:32.400 --> 27:33.266
REBUILD INFRASTRUCTURE.

27:33.333 --> 27:35.200
ON TOP OF THAT, THEY WANT

27:35.266 --> 27:36.733
ANOTHER, THE DEMOCRATS WANT AND

27:36.800 --> 27:39.666
MAY GET 3.5 TRILLION, THAT'S THE

27:39.733 --> 27:41.233
SECOND INFRASTRUCTURE, I'M SURE

27:41.300 --> 27:42.200
THERE ARE A LOT OF WORTHY THINGS

27:42.266 --> 27:44.600
IN THERE BUT IF YOU ASK ME WHAT

27:44.666 --> 27:46.766
CONFIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE THAT

27:46.833 --> 27:49.433
THESE NUMBERS TRILLION FOR THE

27:49.500 --> 27:52.300
FIRST BILL, 3.5 TRILLION FOR THE

27:52.366 --> 27:53.733
OTHER BILL ARE WHAT SHIT

27:53.800 --> 27:54.100
ACTUALLY COSTS?

27:54.166 --> 27:57.433
I WOULD SAY NONE.

27:57.500 --> 27:58.800
WE JUST MAKE NUMBERS AND PULL

27:58.866 --> 28:01.466
THEM OUT OF OUR ASS.

28:01.533 --> 28:02.133
WE DID IT IN AFGHANISTAN, WE DO

28:02.200 --> 28:04.666
IT HERE.

28:04.733 --> 28:07.433
IF THE SECOND BILL COSTS

28:07.500 --> 28:08.233
$350 BILLION IT'S STILL A LOT AS

28:08.300 --> 28:10.000
OPPOSED TO 3.5 TRILLION, WOULD

28:10.066 --> 28:12.066
IT BE ANY DIFFERENT?

28:12.133 --> 28:12.400
I DON'T KNOW.

28:12.466 --> 28:14.466
>> NUMBERS ARE MEANINGLESS TO

28:14.533 --> 28:15.866
PEOPLE, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS

28:15.933 --> 28:17.900
NEEDS NOTHING.

28:17.966 --> 28:21.133
IT'S A THOUSAND BILLION.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.100
>> FOR A COLLAPSED BRIDGE AND

28:22.166 --> 28:25.566
FOR HAVING A 1933 RAIL SYSTEM.

28:25.633 --> 28:27.833
BY THE TIME I GET TO NEW YORK --

28:27.900 --> 28:29.800
>> Bill: I KNOW WE NEED TO DO

28:29.866 --> 28:31.466
THAT, BUT DOES IT COST WHAT THEY

28:31.533 --> 28:32.266
ARE SAYING IT COSTS?

28:32.333 --> 28:33.366
OR IS IT ALL THOSE PEOPLE AND

28:33.433 --> 28:35.700
COUNTIES AROUND WASHINGTON

28:35.766 --> 28:36.433
MAKING THOSE NUMBERS UP AND

28:36.500 --> 28:40.266
GETTING THAT MONEY?

28:40.333 --> 28:42.900
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

28:42.966 --> 28:44.833
>> THERE'S ALWAYS MORE MONEY TO

28:44.900 --> 28:45.633
BE HAD.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.600
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD

28:47.666 --> 28:48.266
PEOPLE AROUND THAT BELTWAY AND I

28:48.333 --> 28:49.566
HAVE TO SPEAK UP FOR THEM

28:49.633 --> 28:51.633
BECAUSE I LIVE WITHIN THE

28:51.700 --> 28:53.400
BELTWAY.

28:53.466 --> 28:54.600
I LIVE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., I'M

28:54.666 --> 28:56.800
A CITY GIRL, YOU KNOW WHAT I

28:56.866 --> 28:58.966

28:59.033 --> 29:04.300
BY THE WAY, I HAVEN'T LOBBIED

29:04.366 --> 29:06.700
BUT YOU GAVE ME A REASON WHY I

29:06.766 --> 29:06.966
SHOULD.

29:07.033 --> 29:10.066
>> Bill: IS NOT JUST LOBBIES.

29:10.133 --> 29:13.633
>> I KNOW, BABY, I KNOW.

29:13.700 --> 29:17.466
MAYBE YOU CAN COME VISIT MY DIGS

29:17.533 --> 29:20.100
ONCE I GET THOSE GIGS.

29:20.166 --> 29:23.566

29:23.633 --> 29:24.333
SHOW WITH STEVE MARTIN.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.166
>> HE HAS THE ORIGINAL HAIR!

29:27.233 --> 29:28.833
>> Bill: AGAIN, AWKWARD

29:28.900 --> 29:30.566
TRANSITION TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

29:30.633 --> 29:33.333
>> I'M ALWAYS HOT, HONEY.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.000
>> Bill: "I'M ALWAYS HOT."

29:36.066 --> 29:42.433
>> COME ON, SUGAR, LAY IT ON US!

29:42.500 --> 29:43.766
>> Bill: HOW DO YOU YOUR

29:43.833 --> 29:45.600

29:45.666 --> 29:46.333

BACK ROOM?

29:48.033 --> 29:51.600
HE HAS SOME LIQUOR.

29:51.666 --> 29:52.433

29:57.866 --> 30:00.000

30:03.500 --> 30:07.866

30:30.833 --> 30:32.966
IT'S SO DEPRESSING, I'M GLAD WE

30:33.033 --> 30:33.800
ARE LAUGHING.

30:33.866 --> 30:34.133
>> THANK YOU.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.166

30:38.233 --> 30:43.200
LINDA MEANS, SENIOR CLIMATE

30:43.266 --> 30:44.366
SCIENTISTS GUARANTEED IT'S GOING

30:44.433 --> 30:46.266

30:51.366 --> 30:53.233
'S LATEST REPORT, THIS IS WHAT

30:53.300 --> 30:54.966
DEPRESSES ME.

30:55.033 --> 30:56.400
234 SCIENTISTS, 14,000 STUDIES

30:56.466 --> 30:58.233
COME I FEEL LIKE DEJA VU.

30:58.300 --> 30:59.866
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE READ THIS

30:59.933 --> 31:00.866
STORY A BILLION TIMES JUST ON

31:00.933 --> 31:02.833
THIS SHOW.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.566
IF WE DON'T DO IT RIGHT NOW,

31:04.633 --> 31:04.900
IT'S TOO LATE!

31:04.966 --> 31:07.966
AND WE NEVER DO AND IT IS

31:08.033 --> 31:08.933
GETTING TOO LATE, I'M NOT

31:09.033 --> 31:10.433
DOUBTING THAT IT IS GOING TO

31:10.500 --> 31:12.500
HAPPEN, IT IS DEFINITELY

31:12.566 --> 31:13.600
HAPPENING.

31:13.666 --> 31:16.000
I'M JUST SAYING NO ONE CARES.

31:16.066 --> 31:18.333
NO ONE CARES ENOUGH, WE JUST, AS

31:18.400 --> 31:20.600
A SOCIETY, AS A WORLD, MADE A

31:20.666 --> 31:22.466
DECISION LIKE THELMA AND LOUISE,

31:22.533 --> 31:23.966
HOLD HANDS AND DRIVE OVER THE

31:24.033 --> 31:24.500
GRAND CANYON.

31:24.566 --> 31:26.066
>> IT ALSO HAS THE OPPOSITE

31:26.133 --> 31:28.966
EFFECT TOO, I SPENT FIVE YEARS

31:29.033 --> 31:29.833
UNFORTUNATELY OUT WITH PEOPLE

31:29.900 --> 31:30.700
WHO WERE MOSTLY FROM VOTERS AND

31:30.766 --> 31:32.033
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CLIMATE

31:32.100 --> 31:32.700
CHANGE, IT USUALLY DOES THAT

31:32.766 --> 31:34.500
COMES UP BY THE WAY, THEY HAVE

31:34.566 --> 31:35.833
BEEN SAYING THIS FOR SO LONG.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.900
IT'S GOING TO BE A DISASTER AND

31:37.966 --> 31:38.800
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?

31:38.866 --> 31:40.466
AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE POINT BACK

31:40.533 --> 31:41.500
TO THE 1970s, THEY SAID THERE

31:41.566 --> 31:42.600
WAS GOING TO BE GLOBAL COOLING,

31:42.666 --> 31:43.900
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE A

31:43.966 --> 31:45.433
FEW MORE DATA POINTS BUT IT DOES

31:45.500 --> 31:48.066
HAVE THAT EFFECT BECAUSE MUCH

31:48.133 --> 31:50.466
LIKE SPENDING, PEOPLE CAN'T GET

31:50.533 --> 31:52.700
A SENSE ABOUT PERIOD OF TIME AND

31:52.766 --> 31:53.566
WHAT HAPPENED.

31:53.633 --> 31:55.600
THIS IS THE SAME OLD STUFF WE

31:55.666 --> 31:56.600
HEAR, THERE'S MORE GOVERNMENT

31:56.666 --> 31:59.200
CONTROL AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING.

31:59.266 --> 32:00.566
>> THE EARTH IS CONSTANTLY

32:00.633 --> 32:03.433
TELLING US TO WAKE UP, RIGHT?

32:03.500 --> 32:05.933
I SOUGHT IN KATRINA, THAT

32:11.700 --> 32:12.466
HELD UP SOME OF THE

32:12.533 --> 32:12.800
NEIGHBORHOODS.

32:12.866 --> 32:15.566
THE TRUTH IS, BILL, THIS HAS

32:15.633 --> 32:16.666
BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LONG TIME

32:16.733 --> 32:19.900
AND WE KEEP IGNORING THE

32:19.966 --> 32:20.133
SCIENCE.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.466
I'M AFRAID WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF

32:22.533 --> 32:26.666
TIME.

32:26.733 --> 32:27.633
REMEMBER AL GORE?

32:27.700 --> 32:28.300
HE WROTE THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH,

32:28.366 --> 32:29.833

32:37.400 --> 32:38.233
HE WALKED IN THE ROOM AND DREW A

32:38.300 --> 32:42.466
MAP ON THE WALL AND I SAID OH

[LAUGHTER]

32:47.400 --> 32:49.833

32:49.900 --> 32:50.833

32:58.666 --> 33:00.666

33:01.300 --> 33:03.400
HE SAT THERE AND HE GOT THE

33:03.466 --> 33:04.366
ENDORSEMENT BECAUSE IT'S GOING

33:04.433 --> 33:06.133
TO BE POOR PEOPLE AND POOR

33:06.200 --> 33:09.033
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GOING TO

33:09.100 --> 33:10.700
SUFFER MOST, ALL OF US WILL

33:10.766 --> 33:12.266
SUFFER BUT WE NEED TO PAY

33:12.333 --> 33:12.933
ATTENTION BECAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE

33:13.000 --> 33:15.433
IS REAL.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.333
I HAVE TO SAY THIS THEN I'M

33:16.400 --> 33:19.433
GOING TO SHUT UP FOR A MOMENT.

33:19.500 --> 33:22.800
LAST YEAR, WE HAD FIVE

36:30.466 --> 36:33.566
GAME.

36:33.633 --> 36:34.033
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

36:34.100 --> 36:36.300
>> YOU THINK LACK OF GAME?

36:36.366 --> 36:37.033
YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE SURVIVED

36:37.100 --> 36:39.700
HAD HE JUST?

36:39.766 --> 36:40.833
>> Bill: NO, I JUST THINK I

36:40.900 --> 36:41.400
WOULDN'T HATE THEM AS MUCH.

36:41.466 --> 36:45.400
IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID YOU KNOW

36:45.466 --> 36:46.966
WHAT, I'M A LONELY GUY.

36:47.033 --> 36:49.466
WHEN POWERFUL MEN CAN'T GET LAID

36:49.533 --> 36:51.333
IT'S A TERRIBLE TRAP THEY'RE IN,

36:51.400 --> 36:53.533
I'M SO POWERFUL AND NO LADIES

36:53.600 --> 36:55.500
LIKE ME -- SO THEY WIND UP DOING

36:55.566 --> 36:58.766
HORRIBLE THINGS.

36:58.833 --> 37:01.366
>> WHAT A SHAME.

37:01.433 --> 37:02.666
>> Bill: WHAT I SAID OR WHAT

37:02.733 --> 37:02.900
HE DID?

37:02.966 --> 37:05.233
>> BOTH.

37:05.300 --> 37:10.533
HE DON'T NEED GAME, TO CREATE

37:10.600 --> 37:11.600
THE KIND OF TOXIC ATMOSPHERE AND

37:11.666 --> 37:12.733
CLIMATE, I AM SO GLAD THAT HE

37:12.800 --> 37:14.600
DECIDED TO RESIGN.

37:14.666 --> 37:18.033
I'M SO GLAD.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.366
>> Bill: NOT REALLY DECIDED,

37:19.433 --> 37:22.400
KICKED OUT.

37:22.466 --> 37:24.200
>> I DON'T THINK HE WOULD'VE

37:24.266 --> 37:25.033
SURVIVED IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT

37:25.100 --> 37:25.700
HAPPENED TO AL FRANKEN OF PEOPLE

37:25.766 --> 37:29.633
IN HIS OWN PARTY.

37:29.700 --> 37:31.000
>> 11 WOMEN CAME FORWARD?

37:31.066 --> 37:34.033
HE WAS DIGGING IN, HE WAS

37:34.100 --> 37:35.266
PLAYING A DONALD TRUMP, I'M IN

37:35.333 --> 37:37.466
DENIAL, THIS IS NOT HAPPENING TO

37:37.533 --> 37:38.100
ME.

37:38.166 --> 37:39.600
>> Bill: WHAT HE DID WAS NOT

37:39.666 --> 37:44.400
AS BAD AS TRAMP, I ASKED THE

37:44.466 --> 37:46.866
STAFF TO COME UP WITH A LIST OF

37:46.933 --> 37:50.033
PEOPLE IN BOTH PARTIES WHO HAVE

37:50.100 --> 37:51.800
HAD SEX SCANDALS, SINCE 1960, I

37:51.866 --> 37:53.233
CROSSED UP FOR THE ONES I DIDN'T

37:53.300 --> 37:54.666
REMEMBER, THE NAME DIDN'T RING A

37:54.733 --> 37:55.400
BELL.

37:55.466 --> 37:56.500
I WOULD LIKE TO SCROLL THROUGH

37:56.566 --> 37:59.666
AND SHOW YOU, HERE THEY ARE.

37:59.733 --> 38:01.733
BOTH PARTIES, DEMOCRATS AND

38:01.800 --> 38:05.133
REPUBLICANS, IT'S QUITE A FEW

38:05.200 --> 38:05.300
MEN!

38:05.366 --> 38:08.000
AND OF COURSE THE WINNER, BY

38:08.066 --> 38:11.300
SIX, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

38:11.366 --> 38:15.133
STILL A LOT, THAT'S 96 PEOPLE.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.166
THAT'S JUST THE ONES WHO GOT

38:16.233 --> 38:18.866
CAUGHT, I'M SURE THERE WERE

38:18.933 --> 38:20.366
OTHERS.

38:20.433 --> 38:21.400
>> THAT SEEMS SLIGHTLY LOW TO

38:21.466 --> 38:21.566
ME.

38:21.633 --> 38:25.033
>> Bill: DISCUSS.

38:25.100 --> 38:26.400
>> POWER, IT'S ABOUT POWER, WE

38:26.466 --> 38:28.200
GOT TO CHANGE THE CULTURE, IT'S

38:28.266 --> 38:29.400
TOXIC AND KEPT WOMEN BEHIND.

38:29.466 --> 38:31.000
>> Bill: YOU SAID YOU WERE

38:31.066 --> 38:32.233
JUST 60?

38:32.300 --> 38:35.533
>> YEAH, BABY, 61 TO BE HONEST.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.633
>> Bill: YOU CAN TAKE A YEAR

38:36.700 --> 38:38.600
OFF, YOU COULD TAKE 20 YEARS

38:38.666 --> 38:38.766
OFF.

38:38.833 --> 38:40.533
>> I'VE LOST A YEAR!

38:40.600 --> 38:44.333
WE ALL DID, THAT PANDEMIC.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.233
I GOT TO MEET MYSELF FOR THE

38:45.300 --> 38:49.166
FIRST TIME.

38:49.233 --> 38:50.900
FIGURE THAT ONE OUT.

38:50.966 --> 38:51.166
[LAUGHTER]

38:51.233 --> 38:53.533
[APPLAUSE]

38:53.600 --> 38:55.266
I HAD NEVER SPENT SEVEN DAYS A

38:55.333 --> 38:57.866
WEEK AT HOME, THE FIRST THING I

38:57.933 --> 38:59.433
SAID WAS WHAT DO PEOPLE DO ALL

38:59.500 --> 38:59.833
DAY?

38:59.900 --> 39:01.233
I HAD NO IDEA, I MISS TRAVELING,

39:01.300 --> 39:03.533
I MISS BEING OUT WITH PEOPLE.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.733
>> Bill: ME TO!

39:06.800 --> 39:11.066
>> I LOVE YOU!

39:11.133 --> 39:11.566
>> Bill: I'M THERE.

39:11.633 --> 39:14.300
OBAMA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

39:17.033 --> 39:26.233
>>> Bill: DID NEITHER WAS I, ITS

39:26.300 --> 39:26.833
GETTING A LOT OF SHIT FROM THE

39:26.900 --> 39:31.100
RIGHT WING, THEY SAID IT'S

39:31.166 --> 39:31.766
ELITIST.

39:31.833 --> 39:33.600
HE'S A VERY RICH AND SUCCESSFUL

39:33.666 --> 39:35.800
GUY, MITT ROMNEY SAYS WE SHOULD

39:35.866 --> 39:37.433
PUNISH SUCCESS, LET'S NOT PUNISH

39:37.500 --> 39:39.966
SUCCESS, WHEN YOU ARE THAT

39:40.033 --> 39:40.833
SUCCESSFUL, YOU GET TO THROW

39:40.900 --> 39:46.166

39:46.433 --> 39:49.000
>> IT'S THE NEW REPUBLICAN

39:49.066 --> 39:49.433
PARTY, ITS POPULIST.

39:49.500 --> 39:50.633
>> Bill: SOMEBODY GOT IN

39:50.700 --> 39:53.900
TROUBLE WHEN THERE WAS A LOT OF

39:53.966 --> 39:54.233
TALK ABOUT --

39:54.300 --> 40:02.366
>> ERIC SHE SNAPPED THE PICTURE.

40:02.433 --> 40:12.966
>> Bill: SO WHAT >> MAINSTREAM

40:13.033 --> 40:17.800
MEDIA SILENCE WHILE OBAMA DANCES

40:17.866 --> 40:19.466
MASK LESS AND THEN SOMEBODY AT

40:19.533 --> 40:20.733
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" SO I OFTEN

40:20.800 --> 40:22.566
HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEM WITH, THIS

40:22.633 --> 40:23.966
IS A SOPHISTICATED, VACCINATED

40:24.033 --> 40:25.466
CROWD AND PEOPLE JUMPED ON THAT.

40:25.533 --> 40:29.066
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY YES,

40:29.133 --> 40:32.233
THAT'S RELEVANT.

40:32.300 --> 40:36.100
>> WAS SHE QUOTING SOMEONE WAS

40:36.166 --> 40:38.933
NOT >> Bill: THEY SAID BUT

40:39.000 --> 40:40.433
LOLLAPALOOZA -- LOLLAPALOOZA IS

40:40.500 --> 40:42.800
NOT A SOPHISTICATED VACCINATED

40:42.866 --> 40:44.233
CROWD, IT'S A BUNCH OF CRAZY

40:44.300 --> 40:46.833
KIDS KIDS WERE NOT VACCINATED ON

40:46.900 --> 40:47.566
ECSTASY, THAT'S DIFFERENT.

40:47.633 --> 40:51.066
>> IT PROVES THE POINT, IT WAS

40:51.133 --> 40:52.400
300,000 PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

40:52.466 --> 40:53.033
LOLLAPALOOZA IN CHICAGO WHICH

40:53.100 --> 40:55.766
WAS SHOCKING AND THERE WERE 200

40:55.833 --> 40:57.733
CASES, 300 CASES AND I DON'T

40:57.800 --> 40:58.833
THINK ANYONE REQUIRED

40:58.900 --> 41:00.566
HOSPITALIZATION AT PEOPLE ARE

41:00.633 --> 41:02.000
ATTACKING OBAMA FOR PARTISAN

41:02.066 --> 41:02.266
PURPOSES.

41:02.333 --> 41:04.733
IF REPUBLICANS WANT TO BE

41:04.800 --> 41:06.733
CONSISTENT ABOUT THIS, ATTACKING

41:06.800 --> 41:08.500
LOCKDOWNS AND PARTICULARLY IN

41:08.566 --> 41:10.833
CALIFORNIA, COVERING THESE

41:10.900 --> 41:11.433
THINGS UP, THIS IS THE EXACT

41:11.500 --> 41:13.766
SAME THING.

41:13.833 --> 41:16.066
ALL THE STUFF WAS OUTSIDE.

41:16.133 --> 41:18.333
>> Bill: IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE

41:18.400 --> 41:19.533
SUPER SANCTIMONIOUS ABOUT COVID

41:19.600 --> 41:22.166
WHICH I'M NOT FOR BUT GAVIN

41:22.233 --> 41:23.600
NEWSOM, NANCY PELOSI,

I WANT TO LIVE MY LIFE AGAIN, WE

41:28.900 --> 41:33.166
ALL WANT TO LIVE OUR LIFE AGAIN.

41:33.233 --> 41:36.200
>> THEY SET POLICY FOR THEIR

41:36.266 --> 41:37.166
STATES, BARACK OBAMA LIVES IN

41:37.233 --> 41:37.766
MARTHA'S VINEYARD.

41:37.833 --> 41:40.600
>> HE HAD A COVERT COORDINATOR,

41:40.666 --> 41:42.066
EVERYONE WAS VACCINATED, THAT

41:42.133 --> 41:42.866
WAS A REQUIREMENT.

41:42.933 --> 41:45.800
PLUS, AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE,

41:45.866 --> 41:47.433
BOTH THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND

41:47.500 --> 41:48.266
FORMER FIRST LADY HAVE SPENT

41:48.333 --> 41:50.933
COUNTLESS HOURS OUT THERE

41:51.000 --> 41:51.800
WARNING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

41:51.866 --> 41:53.000
ENCOURAGING THEM TO GET TESTED,

41:53.066 --> 41:54.866
ENCOURAGING THEM TO GET

41:54.933 --> 41:58.600
VACCINATED, THEY DID THAT.

41:58.666 --> 42:00.466
I DON'T LIKE THE CRITICISM, I

42:00.533 --> 42:01.800
WASN'T INVITED, I WENT TO EVERY

42:01.866 --> 42:03.500
WHITE HOUSE PARTY WHEN HE WAS

42:03.566 --> 42:11.400
PRESIDENT, IT KNOW W -- EIGHT NO

42:11.466 --> 42:12.600
PARTY LIKE A WHITE HOUSE PARTY

42:12.666 --> 42:13.266
BECAUSE A WHITE HOUSE PARTY WILL

42:13.333 --> 42:14.400
STOP!

42:14.466 --> 42:17.300
AFTER MIKE >> YOU DON'T CARE

42:17.366 --> 42:22.533
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET INVITED?

42:22.600 --> 42:27.466
DID YOU GET CAUGHT?

42:27.533 --> 42:29.200
>> I WOULD'VE BEEN PISSED, AFTER

42:29.266 --> 42:30.633
I BOUGHT MY DRESS AND HAD MY

42:30.700 --> 42:30.833
SHOES.

42:30.900 --> 42:37.300
I WAS NOT CUT I WOULD'VE USED

42:37.366 --> 42:39.800
THAT MOMENT TO SAY TOM HANKS,

42:39.866 --> 42:44.633
CUT OF PSA FOR PEOPLE IN THE

42:44.700 --> 42:44.800
ICU.

42:44.866 --> 42:55.533
>> Bill: OPRAH DID MAKE IT

42:55.600 --> 42:55.800
EITHER.

42:55.866 --> 42:58.600
IF I COULD RETURN THE SPECTER OF

42:58.666 --> 43:00.966
GLOBAL WARMING --

43:01.033 --> 43:01.966
>> OH, LORD.

43:02.033 --> 43:04.166
>> Bill: YOU KILL ME.

43:04.233 --> 43:05.233
THAT'S NOT REPRIMANDING YOU.

43:05.300 --> 43:08.400
>> BACK TO MY DRAWING BOARD.

43:08.466 --> 43:09.366
>> Bill: A LOT OF PEOPLE FLEW

43:09.433 --> 43:11.666
IN ON PRIVATE JETS BECAUSE OF

43:11.733 --> 43:14.500
THOSE THESE TYPE OF PEOPLE.

43:14.566 --> 43:16.500
I WANT TO SAY THIS ABOUT THE

43:16.566 --> 43:18.800
ENVIRONMENT AND THERE'S NOTHING

43:18.866 --> 43:20.100
MORE SELFISH YOU CAN DO THAN

43:20.166 --> 43:21.733
TAKE A PRIVATE JET AND EVERYONE

43:21.800 --> 43:23.033
WHO WAS GOING TO THAT PARTY IS

43:23.100 --> 43:27.266
AN ENVIRONMENTALIST.

43:27.333 --> 43:28.966
THIS IS BEEN GOING ON EVER SINCE

43:29.033 --> 43:30.566
THE ENVIRONMENT WAS AN ISSUE.

43:30.633 --> 43:33.800
IF YOU CAN TAKE A PRIVATE JET,

43:33.866 --> 43:34.900
PEOPLE DO.

43:34.966 --> 43:37.100
I DON'T CARE HOW BIG OF AN

43:37.166 --> 43:38.466
ENVIRONMENTALIST THEY SAY THEY

43:38.533 --> 43:40.366
ARE, I DO IT MYSELF TO GET TO

43:40.433 --> 43:41.566
GIGS OR I COULDN'T EVEN DO THE

43:41.633 --> 43:43.166
GIG MOST OF THE TIME.

43:43.233 --> 43:44.700
YOU COULD MAKE THE CASE -- BUT

43:44.766 --> 43:45.900
HOW MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICA IF

43:45.966 --> 43:47.833
THEY COULD TAKE A PRIVATE JET

43:47.900 --> 43:48.733
WOULD REFUSE IT?

43:48.800 --> 43:51.366
I THINK IT'S ABOUT 1% BECAUSE

43:51.433 --> 43:52.133
ALL THESE ENVIRONMENTALISTS DO

43:52.200 --> 43:55.200
IT, IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN

43:55.266 --> 43:57.233
RESIST.

43:57.300 --> 43:58.666
PEOPLE CANNOT RESIST A PRIVATE

43:58.733 --> 43:59.266
JET.

43:59.333 --> 44:01.300
THEY WILL MAKE EXCUSES AND SAY I

44:01.366 --> 44:04.966
BOUGHT CARBON OFFSETS, WE ARE

44:05.033 --> 44:08.200
ALL DRIVING OFF THE GRAND CANYON

44:08.266 --> 44:08.800
HOLDING HANDS, IS THE DECISION

44:08.866 --> 44:12.533
WE MADE.

44:12.600 --> 44:13.800
>> I LOVE THE COMMENT BUT I

44:13.866 --> 44:18.166
DON'T HAVE ANY --

44:18.233 --> 44:19.900
>> Bill: YOU WOULD GO?

44:19.966 --> 44:21.900
>> YEAH, OF COURSE, I DON'T WANT

44:21.966 --> 44:27.666
TO GO THROUGH Z SIOUX FALLS?

44:27.733 --> 44:29.866
>> Bill: JAY-Z WOULD NOT GO ON

44:29.933 --> 44:31.800
THE SPIRIT AIRLINES.

44:31.866 --> 44:34.300
>> IS A GREAT FERRY OVER TO

44:34.366 --> 44:40.000
MARTHA'S VINEYARD.

44:40.066 --> 44:42.366
>> Bill: THAT SWEDISH KID CAN

44:42.433 --> 44:43.466
TAKE THE FERRY, THESE PEOPLE

44:43.533 --> 44:48.700
CAME ON THE PRIVATE JET.

44:48.766 --> 44:53.500
THE LAST THING I WANT TO ASK YOU

44:53.566 --> 44:56.000
ABOUT -- WHAT, IT'S YOUR

44:56.066 --> 44:56.266
BAILIWICK.

44:56.333 --> 44:57.200
>> I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GO

44:57.266 --> 45:00.733
BACK TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

45:00.800 --> 45:03.666
>> Bill: NINA TURNER -- THERE

45:03.733 --> 45:06.033
WAS A SPECIAL ELECTION IN OHIO,

45:06.100 --> 45:06.900
SHE WAS A FIREBRAND, SHE SAID

45:06.966 --> 45:09.966
DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

45:10.033 --> 45:11.200
ABOUT BIDEN, YOU HAVE A BOWL OF

45:11.266 --> 45:15.300
SHIT IN FRONT OF YOU, IT'S STILL

45:15.366 --> 45:17.600
SHIT.

45:17.666 --> 45:19.133
SO SHE LOST, WHICH IS GOOD.

45:19.200 --> 45:21.566
THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO

45:21.633 --> 45:21.733
WIN.

45:21.800 --> 45:24.500
>> HER OPPONENT CAME FROM BEHIN

45:24.566 --> 45:26.733
BEHIND.

45:26.800 --> 45:28.433
>> Bill: THE FAR LEFT FACTION,

45:28.500 --> 45:31.100
THE SQUAD TYPE FOLKS, SHE'S MORE

45:31.166 --> 45:33.533
IN THAT GROUP.

45:33.600 --> 45:34.833
I FEEL LIKE WE ARE BREAKING DOWN

45:34.900 --> 45:38.833
INTO VOTERS AND FOLLOWERS.

45:38.900 --> 45:39.633
CERTAIN PEOPLE GO BY WHAT THE

45:39.700 --> 45:42.666
FOLLOWERS WANT AND CERTAIN

45:42.733 --> 45:44.733
PEOPLE GO BY WHAT THE VOTERS

45:44.800 --> 45:44.933
WANT.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.033
I THINK YOU'RE ON THE VOTERS

45:48.100 --> 45:49.233

CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS, AT

46:05.500 --> 46:06.000
THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW

46:06.066 --> 46:11.766
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

46:11.833 --> 46:13.200
NINA SPENT MONEY ON TV, SHE

46:13.266 --> 46:15.366
FORGOT TO DIRECT PEOPLE TO THE

46:15.433 --> 46:15.933
POLLS.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.066
>> Bill: IS NOT COOL TO SAY

46:18.133 --> 46:20.400
VOTING FOR BIDEN'S VOTING FOR

46:20.466 --> 46:20.666
SHIT.

46:20.733 --> 46:23.133
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

46:23.200 --> 46:25.200
THAT'S A LITTLE -- COME ON.

46:25.266 --> 46:26.966
SHE ALSO WOULDN'T ENDORSE

46:27.033 --> 46:28.400
HILLARY, THIS IDEA THAT I GO ON

46:28.466 --> 46:29.000
A POLITICAL HUNGER STRIKE AND

46:29.066 --> 46:33.700
THEN WE ALL WIN.

46:33.766 --> 46:34.800
>> SHE WON FIVE OUT OF THE NINE

46:34.866 --> 46:37.733
BLACK WARDS AND CLEVELAND ITSELF

46:37.800 --> 46:38.866
AND CUYAHOGA COUNTY, SHE DIDN'T

46:38.933 --> 46:41.366
DO AS WELL, I LOOK AT THE STATS.

46:41.433 --> 46:42.900
SHE LOST THE SUBURBS, IT WAS NOT

46:43.000 --> 46:45.233
ABOUT THE BOWL OF SHIT, IT WAS

46:45.300 --> 46:45.966
ABOUT REMINDING PEOPLE THERE WAS

46:46.033 --> 46:48.200
AN ELECTION THAT MATTERS.

46:48.266 --> 46:48.966
>> Bill: POLITICS IS THE ART

46:49.033 --> 46:51.033
OF THE PRACTICAL AND THE

46:51.100 --> 46:52.133
POSSIBLE.

46:52.200 --> 46:56.666
I GOT TO GO TO NEW RULES.

46:56.733 --> 47:03.600
THANK YOU, CRAZY PEOPLE.

47:03.666 --> 47:04.466
NEW RULE: COUNTRY MUSIC HAS TO

47:04.533 --> 47:09.133
ADMIT IT HAS A DRINKING PROBLEM.

47:09.200 --> 47:09.400
[LAUGHTER]

47:09.466 --> 47:10.533
APPLE MUSIC'S "TODAY'S COUNTRY"

47:22.433 --> 47:23.433
ABOUT BEER, "CAN DOWN" WHICH IS

47:23.500 --> 47:25.433
ALSO ABOUT BEER, "TEQUILA ON A

BOAT," AND "THROW IT BACK."

47:30.200 --> 47:30.400
[LAUGHTER]

47:30.466 --> 47:31.600
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION: IF

47:31.666 --> 47:32.366
THE HEARTLAND IS SO GREAT, WHY

47:32.433 --> 47:40.966
CAN'T THEY ENJOY IT SOBER?

47:41.033 --> 47:42.700
[LAUGHTER]

47:42.766 --> 47:44.266
>> THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

47:44.333 --> 47:47.466
>> Bill: I DID IT FOR YOU!

47:47.533 --> 47:48.200
NEW RULE: STOP MAKING

SIGN IN THE TOWN OF DILDO,

47:50.133 --> 47:51.100
CANADA AND OUR HOLLYWOOD SIGN

47:51.166 --> 47:53.933

47:54.000 --> 47:57.266
FOR ONE THING, A DILDO IS A

47:57.333 --> 47:58.000
PHONY PRICK, AND.

47:58.066 --> 48:05.500
NEVER MIND.

CANADIANS BACK IN!

48:13.900 --> 48:14.300
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

48:14.366 --> 48:14.933
THIS WEEK CANADA REOPENED ITS

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
BORDER TO AMERICANS, BUT WE

48:16.066 --> 48:17.433
DIDN'T DO THE SAME IN RETURN.

48:17.500 --> 48:23.533
WHAT IS THAT ABOOT?

48:23.600 --> 48:25.333
[LAUGHTER]

48:25.400 --> 48:27.166
IT'S CANADA.

48:27.233 --> 48:28.166
YOU KNOW, AMERICA WITHOUT THE

48:28.233 --> 48:32.666
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

48:32.733 --> 48:32.933
[LAUGHTER]

48:33.000 --> 48:33.566
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM, WHAT ARE

48:33.633 --> 48:34.433
THEY GOING TO DO, TAKE ALL THE

48:34.500 --> 48:35.733
GOOD-PAYING IMPROV COMEDY JOBS

48:35.800 --> 48:39.166
AWAY FROM AMERICANS?

48:39.233 --> 48:39.900
OKAY, THEY PROBABLY WILL, BUT

48:39.966 --> 48:40.166
[LAUGHTER]

48:40.233 --> 48:44.833
STILL.

48:44.900 --> 48:46.766
NEW RULE: NOW THAT THE LATEST

48:46.833 --> 48:48.400
ISSUE OF BATMAN COMICS HAS ROBIN

48:48.466 --> 48:50.233
COMING OUT AS BISEXUAL, SOMEONE

48:50.300 --> 48:52.966
HAS TO GET BATMAN'S REACTION.

48:53.033 --> 48:54.366
BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S

48:54.433 --> 48:55.033
GONNA BE.'SINCE WHEN DO YOU LIKE

48:55.100 --> 49:05.366
GIRLS?"

[LAUGHTER]

49:08.400 --> 49:08.800
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

49:08.866 --> 49:09.433
NEW RULE: IF YOU'RE SO DESPERATE

49:09.500 --> 49:10.466
TO LOSE WEIGHT YOU'LL HAVE A

49:10.533 --> 49:11.733
DENTIST IMPLANT THIS CLAMP ON

49:11.800 --> 49:12.900
YOUR TEETH THAT PREVENTS YOU

49:12.966 --> 49:14.333
FROM OPENING YOUR MOUTH WIDE

49:14.400 --> 49:16.633
ENOUGH TO EAT SOLID FOOD --

49:16.700 --> 49:23.133
MAYBE JUST TRY SALAD?

49:23.200 --> 49:24.133
WHAT'S THE POINT OF ACHIEVING A

49:24.200 --> 49:25.466
GREAT BODY WHEN THE ONLY WAY YOU

49:25.533 --> 49:28.033
CAN BRAG ABOUT IT IS BY SAYING

49:28.100 --> 49:36.766
"CHECK OUT MY TIGHT ASS!"

49:36.833 --> 49:37.100
[LAUGHTER]

49:37.166 --> 49:38.066
[APPLAUSE]

49:38.133 --> 49:38.800
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

49:38.866 --> 49:40.100
SOMEONE HAS TO TELL ME: WHY IS

49:40.166 --> 49:41.833
THIS GUY ALWAYS IN THE DOGHOUSE

49:41.900 --> 49:42.900
WITH THE ONLINE HALL MONITORS OF

49:42.966 --> 49:44.666
RIGHTEOUSNESS?

49:44.733 --> 49:46.600
IT'S A PHENOMENON THAT TRULY

49:46.666 --> 49:47.666
FASCINATES ME -- THAT EVERY

49:47.733 --> 49:49.666
COUPLE YEARS, MATT DAMON, ONE OF

49:49.733 --> 49:51.233
THE MOST LIKABLE GUYS IN

49:51.300 --> 49:53.266
HOLLYWOOD, WITH IMPECCABLE

49:53.333 --> 49:55.766
LIBERAL CREDENTIALS, IS FLAILING

49:55.833 --> 49:57.400
AROUND IN CANCEL CULTURE

49:57.466 --> 49:58.966
QUICKSAND.

49:59.033 --> 50:00.233
IT HAPPENED AGAIN THIS MONTH

50:00.300 --> 50:01.166
WHEN DAMON REVEALED THAT HE USED

50:01.233 --> 50:02.500
TO USE A GAY SLUR.

50:02.566 --> 50:04.100
I WON'T SAY THE WORD, BUT IT'S

50:04.166 --> 50:05.700
THE ONE YOUR TEENAGE SON GREETS

50:05.766 --> 50:06.666
HIS FRIENDS WITH WHEN THEY MEET

50:06.733 --> 50:11.966
UP AT CHIPOTLE.

50:12.033 --> 50:12.233
[LAUGHTER]

50:12.300 --> 50:14.866
IT'S NOT ALWAYS MEANT AS A SLUR,

50:14.933 --> 50:16.466
BUT IT'S WRONG, AND DAMON OWNED

50:16.533 --> 50:17.733
UP, SAYING THAT WHILE COMING OF

50:17.800 --> 50:19.433
AGE IN BOSTON IN THE '70S AND

50:19.500 --> 50:20.666
'80S, THAT WORD WAS THROWN

50:20.733 --> 50:21.900
AROUND WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT PUT

50:21.966 --> 50:24.166
INTO IT, AND NOW.

50:24.233 --> 50:25.033
NOW HE'S PUT SOME THOUGHT INTO

50:25.100 --> 50:26.266
IT.

50:26.333 --> 50:28.533
AND HE'S GOING TO STOP USING IT.

50:28.600 --> 50:31.600
ONE MIGHT SAY HE BECAME "WOKE."

50:31.666 --> 50:34.166
OKAY, HE WAS LATE TO THE PARTY

50:34.233 --> 50:35.300
-- TO WHICH WE COULD SAY

50:35.366 --> 50:43.066
"WELCOME, GLAD YOU MADE IT" OR

50:43.133 --> 50:48.200
[APPLAUSE]

50:48.266 --> 50:50.300
WE COULD SAY:

50:50.366 --> 50:51.300
"YOU CAME LATER THAN I DID,

50:51.366 --> 50:52.966
DIE!"

50:53.033 --> 50:54.533
THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN

50:54.600 --> 50:55.733
THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE MOTIVATED

50:55.800 --> 50:57.133
NOT BY WHAT THEY REALLY BELIEVE,

50:57.200 --> 50:58.300
BUT BY WHAT WILL GET TWITTER TO

50:58.366 --> 50:59.033
REACT TO THEM WITH "LIKES" AND

50:59.100 --> 51:00.166
RETWEETS.

51:00.233 --> 51:02.633
THAT'S CALLED BAD FAITH.

51:02.700 --> 51:04.200
IT'S WHY EVERY COUPLE YEARS I'M

51:04.266 --> 51:06.033
READING HEADLINES LIKE USA TODAY

51:06.100 --> 51:06.600
"I WISH I COULD CANCEL MATT

51:06.666 --> 51:09.066
DAMON."

51:09.133 --> 51:10.033
WASHINGTON POST "MATT DAMON HAS

51:10.100 --> 51:13.433
MORE DAMONSPLAINING TO DO!"

51:13.500 --> 51:14.233
DAILY BEAST "SHUT UP, MATT

51:14.300 --> 51:17.066
DAMON."

51:17.133 --> 51:18.900
VOX "MATT DAMON ISN'T A TERRIBLE

51:18.966 --> 51:22.466
PERSON, HE'S JUST IGNORANT."

51:22.533 --> 51:24.100
REALLY -- THAT BAD, IS HE?

51:24.166 --> 51:26.333
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MATT DAMON?

51:26.400 --> 51:27.900
I DON'T KNOW, HE'S GOT A CLEAN

51:27.966 --> 51:30.233
WATER CHARITY AND DELIVERS FOOD

51:30.300 --> 51:31.200
TO HAITI -- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE,

51:31.266 --> 51:39.366
VOX HEADLINE WRITER?

51:39.433 --> 51:43.200
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

51:43.266 --> 51:44.266
AND YET, HE IS ALWAYS GETTING

51:44.333 --> 51:46.966
PULLED OVER BY THE WOKE POLICE

51:47.033 --> 51:48.133
FOR SOMETHING - HE'S GOT A WOKE

51:48.200 --> 51:51.700
RAP SHEET AS LONG AS YOUR ARM:

51:51.766 --> 51:54.000
ON THE REBOOT OF THE "PROJECT

51:54.066 --> 51:55.066
GREENLIGHT" SERIES HE WAS BOOKED

51:55.133 --> 51:56.300
ON OBSTRUCTION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE

51:56.366 --> 51:58.200
FOR MAINTAINING THAT A DIRECTOR

51:58.266 --> 52:01.100
SHOULD BE CHOSEN ON MERIT FIRST.

52:01.166 --> 52:03.100
BUT "MERIT FIRST' IS NOT

52:03.166 --> 52:05.466
SYNONYMOUS WITH RACISM.

52:05.533 --> 52:06.700
THINKING THAT IT IS -- THAT'S

52:06.766 --> 52:13.833
KIND OF RACIST.

52:13.900 --> 52:14.533
[APPLAUSE]

52:14.600 --> 52:16.400
IN 2015 DAMON DID HARD TIME IN

52:16.466 --> 52:18.000
TWITTER JAIL ON TWO COUNTS OF

52:18.066 --> 52:19.433
ACCESSORY TO HOMOPHOBIA FOR

52:19.500 --> 52:21.733
SAYING THAT ACTORS DO WELL WHEN

52:21.800 --> 52:23.533
THEY KEEP THEIR PRIVATE LIVES

52:23.600 --> 52:24.833
PRIVATE SO THAT AUDIENCES CAN

52:24.900 --> 52:26.033
WATCH THE CHARACTER ON THE

52:26.100 --> 52:27.633
SCREEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT

52:27.700 --> 52:29.800
THE CARICATURE FROM THE

52:29.866 --> 52:30.833
TABLOIDS, AND THAT INCLUDES YOUR

52:30.900 --> 52:32.366
SEXUALITY.

52:32.433 --> 52:34.233
WHICH IS TRUE.

52:34.300 --> 52:35.333
ONE OF THE REASONS I LOVE DANIEL

52:35.400 --> 52:36.233
DAY-LEWIS IS I'M NOT SURE HE

52:36.300 --> 52:45.166
EVEN EXISTS OFF SCREEN.

52:45.233 --> 52:46.033
[LAUGHTER]

52:46.100 --> 52:46.733
[APPLAUSE]

52:46.800 --> 52:47.933
BUT IN "WOKEVILLE," SOMEHOW THAT

52:48.000 --> 52:48.833
BECAME "GAY ACTORS SHOULD GO

52:48.900 --> 52:51.066
BACK IN THE CLOSET."

52:51.133 --> 52:52.500
WHICH IS NOT WHAT HE SAID, BUT

52:52.566 --> 52:54.000
THE VERDICT WAS IN AND HE WAS

52:54.066 --> 53:02.800
SENTENCED TO APPEAR ON ELLEN.

53:02.866 --> 53:05.000
[LAUGHTER]

53:05.066 --> 53:07.900
BUT HERE'S HOW UN-HOMOPHOBIC

53:07.966 --> 53:08.766
MATT DAMON IS: HE FUCKED

53:08.833 --> 53:19.433
LIBERACE!

53:19.500 --> 53:21.633
IN 2016 THE MOVIE "THE GREAT

53:21.700 --> 53:22.766
WALL" OPENED. AND DAMON WAS

53:22.833 --> 53:23.733
BROUGHT UP ON CHARGES OF WHITE

53:23.800 --> 53:26.333
WASHING IN THE 3RD DEGREE.

53:26.400 --> 53:28.633
WHITE WASHING BEING WHEN

53:28.700 --> 53:30.600
FILMMAKERS CAST WHITE ACTORS FOR

53:30.666 --> 53:33.033
PARTS MEANT FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR.

53:33.100 --> 53:33.933
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS NOT

53:34.000 --> 53:35.400
DOING.

53:35.466 --> 53:36.266
HIS ROLE WAS NEVER MEANT FOR A

53:36.333 --> 53:38.333
CHINESE ACTOR.

53:38.400 --> 53:40.733
IN FACT, IT WAS A CHINESE MADE

53:40.800 --> 53:42.433
MOVIE TARGETED PRIMARILY TO THE

53:42.500 --> 53:44.833
CHINESE AUDIENCE THAT WAS

53:44.900 --> 53:46.533
PURPOSEFULLY USING HIS WHITE ASS

53:46.600 --> 53:47.566
SO THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE

53:47.633 --> 53:49.966
CROSS-OVER APPEAL HERE.

53:50.033 --> 53:52.033
NEVERTHELESS, WHEN I HEARD ABOUT

53:52.100 --> 53:53.366
THIS, I IMMEDIATELY REPLACED

53:53.433 --> 53:54.233
MATT'S POSTER OVER MY BED WITH

53:54.300 --> 54:04.500
CHRIS EVANS.

54:04.566 --> 54:04.766
[LAUGHTER]

54:04.833 --> 54:05.600
[APPLAUSE]

54:05.666 --> 54:07.633
2017: IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE

54:07.700 --> 54:08.966
METOO MOVEMENT. DAMON WAS LOCKED

54:09.033 --> 54:13.100
UP IN WOKEATRAZ ON A CHARGE OF

54:13.166 --> 54:17.933
AGGRAVATED MANSPLAINING DURING A

54:18.000 --> 54:19.400
RECKONING, AND WAS SENTENCED TO

54:19.466 --> 54:20.433
NOT LESS THAN ONE YEAR OF HAVING

54:20.500 --> 54:25.066
TO SHUT THE FUCK UP.

54:25.133 --> 54:26.033
SEE, WHAT HAPPENED WAS, DURING

54:26.100 --> 54:27.266
AN INTERVIEW WHERE DAMON CALLED

54:27.333 --> 54:29.166
THE METOO MOVEMENT "WONDERFUL"

54:29.233 --> 54:31.266
AND A "WATERSHED MOMENT," HE

54:31.333 --> 54:33.766
ADDED THAT SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

54:33.833 --> 54:36.166
INVOLVED "A SPECTRUM OF

54:36.233 --> 54:37.000
BEHAVIOR" AND THAT THERE WAS "A

54:37.066 --> 54:37.866
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PATTING

54:37.933 --> 54:39.766
SOMEONE ON THE BUTT AND RAPE. "

54:39.833 --> 54:40.666
TRUE.

54:40.733 --> 54:41.466
UNDENIABLE.

54:41.533 --> 54:45.066
AND UNFORGIVABLE.

54:45.133 --> 54:46.333
EVEN THOUGH THE LEGAL SYSTEM HAS

54:46.400 --> 54:48.966
ALWAYS DIFFERENTIATED DEGREES

54:49.033 --> 54:51.133
FOR ALL CRIMES, EVEN MURDER.

54:51.200 --> 54:52.700
OH MATT -- ALWAYS GETTING IN

54:52.766 --> 54:53.533
TROUBLE FOR SAYING PERFECTLY

54:53.600 --> 55:02.766
REASONABLE THINGS.

55:02.833 --> 55:04.366
[APPLAUSE]

55:04.433 --> 55:05.800
AND NOW HE'S DONE IT AGAIN BY

55:05.866 --> 55:09.133
BREAKING LIAM'S LAW.

55:09.200 --> 55:10.166
THAT'S THE LAW THAT REFERS TO

55:10.233 --> 55:11.600
THE TIME A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN

55:11.666 --> 55:13.266
ACTOR LIAM NEESON RECOUNTED A

55:13.333 --> 55:15.133
STORY OF PERSONAL GROWTH

55:15.200 --> 55:16.933
INVOLVING RACIST THOUGHTS HE HAD

55:17.000 --> 55:19.633
AS A YOUNG MAN, BUT THEN

55:19.700 --> 55:20.600
REALIZING THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS

55:20.666 --> 55:21.366
AND EXPUNGING THE RACIST ELEMENT

55:21.433 --> 55:23.033
FROM HIS ANGER.

55:23.100 --> 55:24.400
BUT OF COURSE IN SO DOING, HE

55:24.466 --> 55:25.666
COMMITTED THE CARDINAL SIN OF

55:25.733 --> 55:28.600
ADMITTING HE WAS NOT BORN

55:28.666 --> 55:30.200
PERFECT, AND DID NOT EMERGE FROM

55:30.266 --> 55:35.700
THE WOMB COMPLETELY ENLIGHTENED.

55:35.766 --> 55:38.933
LIKE BUDDHA.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.033
AND NOW MATT'S DONE IT WITH HIS

55:40.100 --> 55:41.400
GAY SLUR ADMISSION.

55:41.466 --> 55:42.500
COMMITTED THE CRIME OF NOT

55:42.566 --> 55:43.666
ALYS BEING THE PERSON YOU

55:43.733 --> 55:46.333
WOULD BECOME.

55:46.400 --> 55:47.700
I'M SO TIRED OF BAD FAITH

55:47.766 --> 55:49.400
ARGUMENTS, AND IT'S ALL WE DO

55:49.466 --> 55:50.266
NOW, ON BOTH SIDES OF OUR

55:50.333 --> 55:52.066
DIVIDE.

55:52.133 --> 55:53.200
TWO WEEKS AGO NANCY PELOSI

55:53.266 --> 55:54.766
CALLED REPUBLICAN HOUSE LEADER

55:54.833 --> 55:57.633
KEVIN MCCARTHY A MORON.

55:57.700 --> 55:59.733
THAT'S NOT THE BAD FAITH PART OF

55:59.800 --> 56:05.500
THE STORY, THAT'S TRUE.

56:05.566 --> 56:06.566
[LAUGHTER]

56:06.633 --> 56:09.500
[APPLAUSE]

56:09.566 --> 56:12.200
BUT A FEW DAYS LATER MCCARTHY

56:12.266 --> 56:12.800
WAS SPEAKING TO A GROUP OF

56:12.866 --> 56:14.866
REPUBLICANS, AND SAID, JOKINGLY

56:14.933 --> 56:17.100
-- BUT HE'S KEVIN MCCARTHY --

56:17.166 --> 56:19.733
THAT IF REPUBLICANS TOOK THE

56:19.800 --> 56:20.800
HOUSE IN 2022 "I WANT YOU TO

56:20.866 --> 56:21.866
WATCH NANCY PELOSI HAND ME THAT

56:21.933 --> 56:22.966
GAVEL.

56:23.033 --> 56:23.766
IT WILL BE HARD NOT TO HIT HER

56:23.833 --> 56:26.433
WITH IT."

56:26.500 --> 56:27.600
PELOSI'S OFFICE CALLED IT "A

56:27.666 --> 56:29.566
THREAT OF VIOLENCE."

56:29.633 --> 56:30.566
HAKEEM JEFFRIES SAID, "VIOLENCE

56:30.633 --> 56:31.700
AGAINST WOMEN IS NO LAUGHING

56:31.766 --> 56:33.700
MATTER."

56:33.766 --> 56:35.333
AND ERIC SWALWELL SAID MCCARTHY

56:35.400 --> 56:36.500
WAS "A WOULD-BE ASSAILANT" WHO

56:36.566 --> 56:38.600
MUST "RESIGN."

56:38.666 --> 56:45.033
SHUT UP.

56:45.100 --> 56:48.500
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

56:48.566 --> 56:49.533
THIS IS WHAT BAD FAITH IS: YOU

56:49.600 --> 56:50.533
DON'T REALLY THINK IT WAS A

56:50.600 --> 56:51.733
THREAT OF VIOLENCE, OR THAT

56:51.800 --> 56:52.866
ANYONE THINKS SUCH VIOLENCE

56:52.933 --> 56:54.366
WOULD BE A LAUGHING MATTER, OR

56:54.433 --> 56:55.466
THAT KEVIN MCCARTHY IS A

56:55.533 --> 56:56.833
WOULD-BE ASSAILANT -- ANYMORE

56:56.900 --> 56:58.600
THAN ANYONE THINKS MATT DAMON'S

56:58.666 --> 57:00.700
A HOMOPHOBE.

57:00.766 --> 57:02.633
AND MATT, MY ADVICE TO YOU: STOP

57:02.700 --> 57:04.300
HUNTING FOR GOOD WILL, YOU'RE

57:04.366 --> 57:05.266
NOT GONNA FIND MUCH IN THIS

57:05.333 --> 57:06.800
COUNTRY.

57:06.866 --> 57:08.333
OKAY, THAT'S OUR SHOW.

57:08.400 --> 57:09.933
I'LL BE AT THE PABST THEATRE IN

57:10.000 --> 57:11.733

THE RYMAN IN NASHVILLE, AUGUST

57:12.900 --> 57:14.133
