we have security cameras

00:12.088 --> 00:13.171
Hey, Kevin.

00:13.255 --> 00:14.213
- I want to talk.

00:16.672 --> 00:19.213
That was nice.

00:19.296 --> 00:21.714
Sonny?
Take a seat, old man.

00:21.797 --> 00:23.380
I want to talk
about the guns you took.

00:23.463 --> 00:26.630
Well, see, I had asked Trice
a question...

00:26.714 --> 00:28.213
which he then decided
not to answer.

00:28.296 --> 00:31.714
Well, he fucked me up real bad
because of you, old man.

00:31.797 --> 00:33.839
You just quit,
like that?

00:33.922 --> 00:36.255
- Talking about us right now!
- And so am I!

00:36.338 --> 00:37.714
Do you have something
figured out?

00:37.797 --> 00:39.046
Yeah, this food truck--

00:39.130 --> 00:40.755
I don't know shit
about that, man, like...

00:40.839 --> 00:42.213
But I do. I just need
something that's mine.

00:42.296 --> 00:44.046
- Let me see what I can do.

00:44.130 --> 00:45.964
- I got shit to do.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.630
What's up
with all the questions?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.088
We just don't want
anything to happen to you.

00:49.171 --> 00:50.505
I'm good!
You're not good.

00:50.588 --> 00:52.130
You the motherfucker
that shot somebody!

00:52.213 --> 00:55.630
Friends don't keep secrets
from one another.

00:55.714 --> 00:57.714
Papa!
Here she is!

00:57.797 --> 00:59.505
- I could make this dope.
- I like to hear that!

00:59.588 --> 01:01.130
Don't act like
you some father of the year

01:01.213 --> 01:02.714
'cause you had him
for two weeks.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.463
If you start paying
some child support,

01:04.547 --> 01:06.338
then we'll talk
about visitation rights.

01:06.422 --> 01:07.714
Fuck you, Tiffany.

01:07.797 --> 01:08.714
I'm grabbing
the diaper bag, and I'm going--

01:08.797 --> 01:09.964
Stay away from my baby...

01:10.046 --> 01:11.463
Stop trying to get strong
with me.

01:11.547 --> 01:12.255
- Or I'm calling the police.

01:12.338 --> 01:15.046
Everything
all right, baby?

01:15.130 --> 01:17.046
I'm just glad
to see you happy and...

01:17.130 --> 01:19.672
doing what you want to do.

01:19.755 --> 01:22.463
I know I can't take back
what I did,

01:22.547 --> 01:24.088
but it'll never happen again.

01:24.171 --> 01:24.672

01:31.213 --> 01:32.964
you know,
the star basketball player.

01:33.046 --> 01:35.505
On my granny's soul,
I have no idea.

01:35.588 --> 01:36.839
About that cop again.

01:36.922 --> 01:38.505
Some dude named Wallace.

01:38.588 --> 01:39.213
Has Trice
got him in pocket?

01:39.296 --> 01:40.964
He get a taste of everything.

01:41.046 --> 01:41.547
Just tell me what

03:57.547 --> 04:00.296
My step-daddy was a junkie.

04:00.380 --> 04:02.880
He owed this man money

04:02.964 --> 04:04.046
and, um, drove me to his house,

04:04.130 --> 04:07.505
and he just left me with him.

04:07.588 --> 04:10.130
He was a lot older than me.

04:10.213 --> 04:13.797
Gave me my own room
with a TV in it and...

04:13.880 --> 04:17.672
then one night...

04:17.755 --> 04:21.130
came in.

04:21.213 --> 04:22.547
I got pregnant that spring.

04:24.255 --> 04:27.296
I told him I wanted
an abortion.

04:27.380 --> 04:31.213
And he told me
that was never gonna happen.

04:32.422 --> 04:34.171
So I did the only thing
I could think of.

04:34.255 --> 04:36.797
I...

04:36.880 --> 04:38.547
I took matters
into my own hands.

04:38.630 --> 04:40.296
I...

04:40.380 --> 04:43.839
found a bottle of Advil,
and I swallowed them all.

04:46.171 --> 04:48.130
He took me to the hospital.

04:50.046 --> 04:52.755
I don't...

04:52.839 --> 04:55.422
I don't know why I didn't
tell somebody then...

04:55.505 --> 04:59.088
what he was doing to me.

05:00.422 --> 05:04.714
When we got home,
I made him an offer.

05:04.797 --> 05:07.213
I told him if I kept the baby,
he had to...

05:07.296 --> 05:09.672
he had to let me go.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.880
And thank God I did.

05:20.046 --> 05:22.046
That's how I got my Jason.
