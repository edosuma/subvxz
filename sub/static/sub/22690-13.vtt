00:35.452 --> 00:37.329
Dad. Dad! Dad!

00:37.412 --> 00:38.830
- Okay. Watch it. Come on.
- Dad.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.332
Dinah. Dinah?

00:40.415 --> 00:41.895
I need your help. He needs your help.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.958
- Please, he's barely breathing.
- Who is this man?

00:44.001 --> 00:46.401
- I'll explain it later.
- What have you brought to our door?

00:46.463 --> 00:48.263
- He needs a doctor. Please.
- Please.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.508
- Put him on the bed.
- Thank you.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.803
- Do you know who that man is?
- Everything else can wait.

00:56.973 --> 00:59.293
- One, two, three.
- How did he get these injuries?

00:59.351 --> 01:00.518
- Stay back.
- He was beaten.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.644
He was tortured.

01:05.815 --> 01:06.941
- Hold on to this.
- Okay.

01:11.363 --> 01:12.405
He's not what they say.

01:12.905 --> 01:14.699
"They"? Who are they?

01:14.783 --> 01:18.036
The people you work for? The government?
- I made a choice.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.622
Seems you've made it for all of us.

01:20.705 --> 01:22.850
- We're breaking the law.
- We're not, yet.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.334
- Farah.
- Technically.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.460
Darling.

01:25.543 --> 01:28.623
We know better than most,
sometimes a criminal's a freedom fighter.

01:28.671 --> 01:31.091
Yes. But we didn't take sides.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.803
Whoa. What's happening? Frank!

01:35.887 --> 01:36.929
What's happening?

01:37.013 --> 01:38.806
He has a severe trauma to the chest.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.976
I think he has a broken rib
that has punctured his lung.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.271
It causes tension pneumothorax.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.273
If we don't treat it,
your friend will die.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.482
What do we do?

01:48.525 --> 01:50.652
Give me that.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.614
Frank? Frank? He can't breathe.

01:58.826 --> 01:59.827
Shit.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.792
Please, please, please, please, please.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.628
That's it.

02:09.711 --> 02:12.006
Oh, thank God.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.600
- North wing clear.
- Copy that.

His volume is increased, thanks to you.
And his breathing is much better now.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.548
Just matter of time.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.013
Madani.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.518
Where's Russo? Did you get him?

06:34.727 --> 06:35.937
Uh, no. He got away.

06:41.609 --> 06:42.777
Tell you what.

06:45.237 --> 06:46.906
Looks like he got hit by a train.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.867
I can't find it in my heart
to have much sympathy.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.828
Any word from Madani?

06:54.581 --> 06:55.582
No.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.627
Russo's running amok
and your pet agent just disappeared

06:59.711 --> 07:01.546
with the most wanted man in New York.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.423
- We don't know that.
- Don't we?

07:09.929 --> 07:11.973
I think purple might be your color.

07:12.056 --> 07:14.225
Really matches your eyes.

07:15.059 --> 07:18.104
Look, uh...

07:19.272 --> 07:20.940
Got you a little something.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.317
It's kind of like a thank you for after.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.533
Where'd you get this?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.661
Well, same as everything.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.876
It's a lot of money right there.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.170
Yeah, well, I...
I stole it from bad guys, you know.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.255
Learned that from you.

07:44.338 --> 07:47.383
You had access to money like this,
you made us live in that shithole?

07:49.260 --> 07:50.553
Use it.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.722
Get out of the city.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.519
Have a life. You've done enough, yeah?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.232
I've gotta finish this, right?

08:05.610 --> 08:06.611
How do you feel?

08:07.361 --> 08:08.738
I feel like shit.

08:10.322 --> 08:11.991
- Frank...
- I think we, um...

08:13.159 --> 08:15.202
Let's not, you know?

08:18.414 --> 08:21.417
- Where's the van?
- Uh, it's where we left it.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.336
- Where we agreed.
- Okay.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.468
Madani, I appreciate
everything you did here.

08:30.968 --> 08:31.968
You know.

08:33.054 --> 08:37.390
I apologize if I caused you or...
you know, your family any grief.

08:38.142 --> 08:41.477
Well, the good thing is, so much shit
just exploded that everyone stinks.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.732
But they'll be coming.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.277
You should take Lieberman's little gift
and disappear, fast.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.074
You don't have a monopoly
on payback, Castle.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.621
Could just keep hold of these.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.540
Yeah.

09:21.185 --> 09:25.439
If I ever see you again after you walk
out of this door, then all bets are off.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.860
I will take you in,
or I will shoot you down.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.154
I'll see you around, Madani.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.909
Don't waste the chance I've given you.

09:43.583 --> 09:47.294
Dinah, you let Castle go.
Please don't pretend differently.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.756
It took two men
painted as criminals and traitors

09:49.839 --> 09:52.109
- to do what none of you was willing to do.
- We didn't know.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.176
Bullshit. You didn't want to know.

09:54.677 --> 09:58.765
Castle risked his life to give us
all the evidence we'd ever need.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.446
Where's Castle? Where did you take him?

10:18.034 --> 10:21.203
I was taking him into custody
when he overpowered me and escaped.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.290
The man looked half dead.

10:24.373 --> 10:28.044
- Maybe he was faking.
- Dinah, cut the shit.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.422
You assisted a wanted terrorist
in his escape.

10:31.505 --> 10:32.505
Did I?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.427
We all need to be wary of accusations
without proof.

10:36.510 --> 10:40.431
Like, say, someone accusing
a decorated CIA official

10:40.514 --> 10:44.560
of running an illegal heroin operation
and assassination program.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.189
Or that government departments
colluded to keep it quiet.

10:49.691 --> 10:50.983
Dinah...

10:52.944 --> 10:56.030
- What have you done here?
- I did what was right.

10:57.364 --> 11:01.661
Now, you have a choice. You can arrest me
or you can let me do my job.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.924
Do you know where they are, Dinah?

11:18.511 --> 11:19.511
No.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.351
But maybe that's for the best, Rafi.

11:26.268 --> 11:30.732
I mean, do you really want either of them
in custody, telling their story?

11:33.025 --> 11:34.443
She's not wrong, Rafi.

11:38.447 --> 11:42.326
Go and start writing up your report
on the raid, all of this.

11:43.369 --> 11:47.123
You do anything else,
you're finished here. Am I clear?

11:49.166 --> 11:50.334
Yes, sir.

11:59.886 --> 12:03.014
- She's a piece of work.
- Yes, she is.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.018
I think I like her.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.008
I... Oh. Hi.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.097
Home sweet home.

12:45.639 --> 12:49.060
Yeah, right?

12:50.019 --> 12:51.312
Where were you?

12:51.896 --> 12:54.732
You know, you can't just disappear
like that. I was worried sick.

12:54.816 --> 12:59.153
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, I'm back, you know. And...

12:59.695 --> 13:02.281
It's okay.

13:02.364 --> 13:03.365
Is it?

13:07.829 --> 13:08.830
I...

13:09.746 --> 13:13.876
It's gonna be, like,
a readjustment period, obviously, but...

13:16.337 --> 13:17.546
Couple days.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.115
How's Frank?

13:46.325 --> 13:47.618
He's alive.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.578
Ah.

13:51.705 --> 13:52.999
He's gone.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.701
Looking for this?

14:37.751 --> 14:38.920
How you doing, Billy?

14:39.836 --> 14:41.255
I've had better days.

14:42.965 --> 14:46.677
Yeah. I've seen you on the news.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.555
"Armed and dangerous."

14:52.099 --> 14:53.517
They have no idea, huh?

14:55.311 --> 14:57.146
Wilson kid do that to your face?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.066
Yeah.

15:01.317 --> 15:04.195
Still... I'm getting old.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.489
Figured the scars will just
give me character.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.740
What do you think?

15:08.824 --> 15:11.785
I think I'd have shot the little bastard
before he got the chance.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.999
Yeah, yeah, of course. Go ahead.

15:25.382 --> 15:29.220
Wow, Billy.
You look ready for action.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.347
Well, I got a few scores to settle.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.349
Is that why you're here?

15:35.184 --> 15:36.185
No.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.647
No. You've done me no wrong,
as far as I know.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.191
I got a couple of questions for you,
though.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.694
How long did you know Frank was alive?

15:47.196 --> 15:48.197
Hmm?

15:49.240 --> 15:52.409
Did you know back when we were
getting drunk at his grave?

15:56.788 --> 15:57.706
Yeah.

15:57.789 --> 15:58.790
Hmm.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.543
So, one of my friends is trying
to kill me,

16:01.627 --> 16:03.796
and the other one has been lying to me
this whole time.

16:05.797 --> 16:07.424
Man, that shit hurts.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.802
Billy, you did some really bad shit.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.640
- You need to get help, brother.
- Is that right?

16:16.017 --> 16:17.101
What you want me to do?

16:17.184 --> 16:19.645
You want me to come sit
in your little circle, share...

16:21.355 --> 16:22.606
tell stories, talk about...

16:24.108 --> 16:26.027
how I got myself all turned around?

16:26.943 --> 16:31.240
Did you, Billy? Did you get turned around?

16:35.369 --> 16:36.412
No.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.384
You mind if I make some coffee?

16:51.927 --> 16:52.928
Sure.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.098
I could use a cup myself.

17:04.981 --> 17:07.733
I kept Frank's secret
because he asked me to.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.445
And I would have done the same thing
for you.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.364
And you know what the crazy thing is?

17:12.448 --> 17:16.077
Frank didn't want you to know he was alive
because he wanted to protect you.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.621
Frank is a dumb,
stubborn son of a bitch.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.583
None of us needs to be
in this situation.

17:22.665 --> 17:24.106
You wanna blame somebody for this...

17:25.877 --> 17:26.920
you blame him.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.217
What?

17:31.967 --> 17:33.885
Come on. Who gives a shit? Drugs?

17:34.678 --> 17:37.098
They're gonna come in somehow,
might as well be us.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.225
And what, we killed a couple Afghans.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.103
That's all they do.

17:42.894 --> 17:44.063
They kill each other.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.440
I was never hurting him.

17:50.486 --> 17:54.115
You know, you two...
You two are almost exactly alike.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.533
There's just one difference.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.287
Frank would never betray a brother.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.707
Yeah, well...

18:05.167 --> 18:07.002
that's why I'm here, Curtis.

18:09.296 --> 18:11.173
I'm gonna make you betray a brother.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.220
Where's Frank?

18:18.097 --> 18:20.432
So what?
You gonna kill me with my own gun?

18:22.476 --> 18:23.476
Nah.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.022
I'll probably just shoot you in
your good leg a bunch until you tell me.

18:43.079 --> 18:44.165
Hmm.

19:21.117 --> 19:22.786
You peg-leg bastard!

19:32.171 --> 19:33.171
God damn it.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.285
You there?

20:07.831 --> 20:09.791
Come on, don't tell me I killed you now.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.169
Yeah, I'm here.

20:14.213 --> 20:18.217
I'm gonna be honest...
I'm taking this kinda personally.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.054
Well, I wonder who that could be.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.932
Go ahead, answer it.

20:27.768 --> 20:28.977
Answer it!

20:33.482 --> 20:34.483
Yeah.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.610
You all right?

20:37.736 --> 20:40.739
Took one in the shoulder.
Bleeding pretty bad.

20:41.948 --> 20:44.743
Put him on. Go on.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.247
He wants to talk to you.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.167
Now, if I give you this phone,
are you gonna shoot me?

20:53.960 --> 20:55.003
Not right now.

20:55.546 --> 20:56.880
Do you promise?

20:56.964 --> 20:59.299
I'm not the one's been lying
all this time, Curtis.

20:59.841 --> 21:00.967
Send it over.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.273
Frank.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.443
Shit, we know each other so well,
we saw each other coming.

21:17.526 --> 21:21.613
Let's end this, Bill, hmm?
No one else needs to get hurt.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.284
I will happily hurt everyone you ever
gave a shit about until I get to you.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.911
You want me, come get me. I'm right here.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.873
Let him go, Bill.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.168
I'll let you walk out that door.
I give you my word.

21:35.251 --> 21:36.920
That still means something.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.047
Now that's easy for you to say.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.134
You got the higher ground
and all the advantages.

21:43.969 --> 21:47.263
So maybe I just stay here,
wait for Curt to bleed out.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.143
Then my next call is to Homeland.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.772
Come on, Bill.
Let's just finish it, you and me.

21:56.357 --> 21:57.899
Any way you want.

22:00.777 --> 22:01.778
All right.

22:03.530 --> 22:04.865
I'm gonna trust you.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.620
Soon as I hear that magazine
and cartridge eject from your rifle.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.499
Okay.

22:19.755 --> 22:20.756
You happy?

22:41.652 --> 22:44.195
Let's meet tonight. Midnight.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.284
How about by your painted ponies, Frankie?

22:49.993 --> 22:51.286
How you feel about that?

22:53.121 --> 22:54.998
Finish this where it all started.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.892
Call yourself an ambulance.
My word means something, too.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.359
Honey, look.

23:23.444 --> 23:24.861
Wanna give it a shot?

23:34.455 --> 23:36.790
They're gonna be too old for this.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.917
Ah, stop that.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.502
- They're growing up fast.
- Yeah.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.130
Yo! Yo!

23:45.006 --> 23:46.424
Come get it while it's hot!

23:47.217 --> 23:48.937
- Look at these two.
- Yeah.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.303
Two peas in a pod.

23:53.389 --> 23:54.766
Hey, you.

23:55.642 --> 23:56.977
- Hey, back.
- Hey.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.566
Can I get a real horse now?

24:02.649 --> 24:05.410
I'm just saying, little Frank,
I think it shows a lack of imagination.

24:05.443 --> 24:07.278
I mean, your dad is a good guy and all.

24:07.362 --> 24:10.323
I just think he could have named you
something different.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.033
You hear Uncle Billy?

24:12.117 --> 24:14.620
It's impossible
not to hear your Uncle Billy, bud.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.872
He talks very loud and very often.

24:16.955 --> 24:20.834
See, now, I was named after
the most famous outlaw that ever lived.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.043
Oh, Jesse James?

24:22.127 --> 24:24.379
No. Billy the Kid.

24:24.462 --> 24:27.048
And Billy the Kid was the fastest gun
in the West.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.467
He was an orphan just like me,
from New York.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.631
Then he went out West and he survived
on nothing but his wits and his bravery,

24:32.679 --> 24:36.349
and nobody could catch him,
'cause he was too smart and too badass.

24:36.432 --> 24:38.727
Then what happened?

24:38.810 --> 24:40.979
Pissed off the wrong people.
They killed him for it.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.231
Don't listen.
Your father has no sense of the romantic.

24:43.314 --> 24:45.275
Just ask your mother.

24:45.817 --> 24:50.113
What? He was betrayed by his friend
for money and fame.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.575
- That sucks.
- It does suck.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.952
About the worst thing in this world
that can happen.

24:58.496 --> 24:59.998
- Uncle Bill...
- Mm-hmm?

25:00.081 --> 25:04.753
If you were an orphan, how do you know
you were named after Billy the Kid?

25:08.506 --> 25:09.758
Attagirl. Well done.

25:09.841 --> 25:14.179
Lisa... you are way too smart
to be your dad's kid.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.515
I do not know the answer to that.

25:17.599 --> 25:18.600
Aw!

25:19.560 --> 25:23.229
This is all the family you need.
Right here.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.481
Oh, thanks. That's nice.

25:38.579 --> 25:39.955
There you go.

25:40.622 --> 25:43.458
Do you have any queens?

25:47.128 --> 25:48.296
Take 'em.

25:49.631 --> 25:52.467
- Do you have any nines?
- Go fish.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.677
Dang.

25:55.136 --> 25:57.097
I'll take those nines of yours now.

25:59.265 --> 26:00.601
Thank you.

26:02.352 --> 26:06.022
You guys know anybody else
that's ever been in a safe house?

26:06.106 --> 26:08.274
- Who'd want to?
- Yeah.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.068
We gonna be here long?

26:11.653 --> 26:13.697
Uh... No.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.283
More like a shit house.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.919
Okay. Zach, do you...

26:28.003 --> 26:30.171
Hey, you know what, kiddos, um,

26:30.255 --> 26:32.758
I gotta talk to your dad
about something important.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.593
Can you play without him for a second?
Come here.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.804
- No.
- Okay.

26:37.888 --> 26:39.681
All right. I'll be right back.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.225
- Play on your own.
- Any eights?

26:42.308 --> 26:44.811
- You just cheated!
- Says the cheater.

26:44.894 --> 26:47.230
- Give me 'em. Thank you.
- Okay.

26:48.523 --> 26:51.442
- Come here.
- Look...

26:54.404 --> 26:55.739
I don't think I can just...

27:03.579 --> 27:06.708
Yeah.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.395
Shh!

27:36.822 --> 27:40.616
Ah, ah, no, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.392
Shit, sorry.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.897
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

28:14.650 --> 28:17.612
Oh, I missed you. I missed you.

28:20.448 --> 28:21.783
I missed you.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.078
Had a good time?

28:26.121 --> 28:27.580
- Yeah.
- Good.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.796
Carl, stop. Come on, seriously, stop.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.464
Just take this, okay?

28:37.173 --> 28:41.136
All right, come on. We have to finish
packing up before Mr. Pritchard gets back.

28:42.095 --> 28:45.556
Carl, I'm serious.
He's gonna be so pissed if he finds us.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.726
Yeah, like he's gonna show up right now.

28:51.646 --> 28:55.442
- We have the place all to ourselves.
- Oh, very romantic.

28:55.525 --> 28:57.277
You're so bad.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.448
Excuse me, guys.
Sorry for the interruption.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.869
You shouldn't be back here, mister.

29:08.371 --> 29:10.582
I was wondering
if you could help me with something.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.211
Jesus, Frank.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.601
Dinah.

31:37.853 --> 31:39.022
Dinah!

31:42.984 --> 31:44.360
Agent Madani!

32:19.520 --> 32:20.563
Dad, look.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.000
Yeah?

33:23.292 --> 33:24.919
You out there, Frankie?

33:27.338 --> 33:30.175
Yeah, of course you are.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.634
They're bleeding out.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.930
Remind me how it goes again.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.477
Ticktock, ticktock, right?

33:46.024 --> 33:48.651
Guess two more kids are gonna die for you.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.780
Help!

35:47.270 --> 35:49.439
Guys like us, Frank, we need this!

35:50.731 --> 35:52.150
It's all we're good for.

35:53.359 --> 35:57.112
Just a couple of assholes who thought
we could have the good things in life.

35:58.989 --> 36:01.617
But we are not good people, Frank.

36:05.621 --> 36:06.872
We never were!

36:16.466 --> 36:18.301
What happens when we're dead?

36:20.135 --> 36:21.135
Nothing.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.515
Who mourns us, huh?

36:26.809 --> 36:28.018
Nobody.

36:30.020 --> 36:34.234
Me and you, Frankie... we're the same.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.970
All right, that's enough, Frank!

37:04.514 --> 37:06.307
I said that's enough of this shit!

37:22.072 --> 37:23.072
You come out.

37:25.826 --> 37:29.830
You come out where I can see you,
or I kill these kids right now.

37:36.003 --> 37:37.087
You beg.

37:38.172 --> 37:43.135
You beg my friend Frank to come out
and save your lives right now!

37:43.218 --> 37:44.219
Beg!

37:44.304 --> 37:47.515
Just do it. Please.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.893
Do what he says, please.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.145
Please just do it.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.570
Bill... let 'em go.

38:03.113 --> 38:04.365
Lose the gun, Frank.

38:06.116 --> 38:07.702
Toss the gun, nice and far!

38:14.208 --> 38:15.335
Okay.

38:19.589 --> 38:20.631
Knife, too.

38:36.522 --> 38:37.922
What are you doing?

38:37.982 --> 38:40.109
Shut up,
or I put a bullet in you right now!

38:44.780 --> 38:47.908
Bill... let 'em go.

38:48.868 --> 38:52.204
Bill... let them go.

38:56.792 --> 38:58.753
Attachments are a weakness, Frank.

39:02.214 --> 39:03.383
I never had anybody.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.096
You had us, Bill.

39:12.475 --> 39:13.768
The Punisher?

39:16.604 --> 39:18.773
What a crock of shit.

39:26.656 --> 39:29.700
You always did care too goddamn much.

39:29.784 --> 39:30.785
Please, lady.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.416
Look at yourself.

41:03.043 --> 41:04.295
Pathetic.

41:58.140 --> 42:00.267
No, no!

42:48.065 --> 42:49.274
Kill me.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.573
Do it!

43:06.125 --> 43:07.793
I'm not gonna let you die today.

43:09.211 --> 43:10.462
Please.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.506
Dying's easy.

43:19.054 --> 43:20.389
You're gonna learn about pain.

43:21.724 --> 43:22.933
You're gonna learn about loss.

43:27.146 --> 43:31.358
Every morning... I look for 'em, Bill.

43:32.943 --> 43:36.446
I look for 'em... but then I remember.

43:37.364 --> 43:38.991
It's gonna be the same for you.

43:39.867 --> 43:44.496
When you look at your ugly, mangled face,
you're gonna remember what you did.

43:44.579 --> 43:46.081
You'll remember, Bill.

43:49.877 --> 43:52.462
You're gonna remember me!

43:59.970 --> 44:01.055
Yeah.

44:09.438 --> 44:10.480
Help us.

44:11.774 --> 44:13.025
Please, please, please.

44:13.108 --> 44:14.359
Please.

44:42.554 --> 44:44.181
God damn it, Madani.

45:02.867 --> 45:04.034
I got you.

45:05.660 --> 45:06.661
I got you.

45:14.503 --> 45:15.796
Thank you.

45:33.355 --> 45:34.565
Uncuff him.

45:37.567 --> 45:38.610
Thank you.

45:44.909 --> 45:49.079
Well, you took a bullet to the head
and you're still kicking.

45:49.163 --> 45:52.166
Never cease to amaze, Madani.

45:54.751 --> 45:57.129
Maybe that bullet
was meant for me, huh?

45:58.255 --> 45:59.840
But you saved my life.

46:00.591 --> 46:03.093
It would be a shame
for us to take that from you.

46:04.761 --> 46:07.347
- You got a pass, Mr. Castle.
- Pass?

46:07.431 --> 46:10.142
The country owes you a debt
it can never repay.

46:10.225 --> 46:11.393
And for that, I am sorry.

46:12.186 --> 46:16.982
What are you sorry for?
Is it the debt or is it the pass?

46:18.901 --> 46:21.195
What is this, a payoff?
You want me to keep my mouth shut?

46:21.278 --> 46:22.279
Pretty much.

46:23.363 --> 46:26.992
We've redirected the narrative
for recent events.

46:27.076 --> 46:30.454
Lewis Wilson and Russo are the only
suspects anyone needs right now.

46:30.537 --> 46:32.289
You're officially still at large...

46:32.873 --> 46:36.168
but we wiped your prints and DNA
from the criminal justice system

46:36.251 --> 46:38.712
and replaced them
with those of a dead man.

46:39.588 --> 46:41.882
We've done what we can
to give you your life back.

46:43.008 --> 46:46.303
Pete Castiglione is a free man.

46:47.304 --> 46:48.222
You were betrayed.

46:48.305 --> 46:50.865
Some kind of justice was done,
and we hope that's enough for you.

46:51.516 --> 46:53.978
I tell ya,
I'm surprised you didn't just kill me.

46:54.061 --> 46:55.581
You must have thought about it, right?

46:55.645 --> 46:58.148
This is what Dinah wanted for you.

47:03.862 --> 47:05.989
The men I wanted have all been punished.

47:07.282 --> 47:10.702
And maybe knowing where the bodies
are buried is a good thing.

47:10.785 --> 47:12.662
Enjoy your freedom, Mr. Castle.

47:12.746 --> 47:15.082
Though I do wonder
what freedom means to a man like you.

47:15.165 --> 47:16.876
Pleasure.

47:18.502 --> 47:20.837
What about Russo? What happened?

47:22.256 --> 47:24.591
Kept him under the knife for 11 hours.

47:24.674 --> 47:25.675
He should live,

47:25.759 --> 47:29.889
but they have no idea if he'll ever regain
significant brain function,

47:29.972 --> 47:31.181
or to what degree.

47:32.682 --> 47:35.477
He could wake up tomorrow or never.

47:36.186 --> 47:39.606
Remember everything,
or not even his own name.

47:43.152 --> 47:44.569
I hope he does.

47:45.862 --> 47:48.573
I hope he remembers everything.

47:50.910 --> 47:52.912
So that when I stand in front of him...

47:55.247 --> 47:57.041
he knows I played my part.

47:58.708 --> 48:00.002
Smell that.

48:00.085 --> 48:02.087
- Oh, that smell.
- So good.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.339
You guys, come here.

48:04.423 --> 48:06.008
Oh, coming, coming.

48:06.633 --> 48:08.153
- Oh, that looks so good.
- Yeah.

48:08.177 --> 48:10.262
Oh, my God!
This is gonna be great, Mom.

48:10.887 --> 48:11.888
Hold it.

48:13.265 --> 48:15.505
- Oh, my God.
- You put it over there, Leo.

48:30.490 --> 48:35.370
Three days of depositions and testimony

48:35.454 --> 48:39.166
and walking Homeland
through all that stuff,

48:39.249 --> 48:42.127
and I'm, like,
just thinking about this moment, right?

48:42.211 --> 48:43.420
Now, I'm...

48:47.591 --> 48:48.633
Oh!

48:49.593 --> 48:50.719
I'm nervous.

48:56.391 --> 48:59.061
- Am I being an asshole here?
- Yeah.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.149
Yeah.

49:06.693 --> 49:08.028
Okay.

49:10.405 --> 49:12.908
- All right, let's do this.
- David, I'm not coming.

49:13.533 --> 49:16.620
You know... You know why I can't.

49:54.992 --> 49:56.034
Do it, buddy.

49:59.454 --> 50:00.830
- They're here. Come on.
- Okay.

50:05.752 --> 50:06.920
- Hi.
- Dad!

50:15.429 --> 50:16.471
Hi.

50:28.817 --> 50:30.026
Where's Pete?

50:31.320 --> 50:32.487
Come on.

50:46.168 --> 50:48.795
Curt. How's it going?

50:51.131 --> 50:52.299
You know what, Frank?

50:53.092 --> 50:56.720
I've come to the conclusion that you are
a shit magnet of the highest order.

50:56.803 --> 51:00.724
Yeah, well...
you might be right, Curt.

51:01.183 --> 51:02.267
Might be right.

51:04.436 --> 51:06.605
You sure about this?

51:07.272 --> 51:09.816
Yeah, I'm sure. It's time.

51:11.025 --> 51:12.361
You're safe here, Frank.

51:13.528 --> 51:15.029
We keep each other's secrets.

51:16.030 --> 51:17.699
That's the only way this works.

51:22.079 --> 51:23.872
You know, long as I was at war...

51:25.124 --> 51:28.960
you know, I never thought about, uh,
what would happen next.

51:30.796 --> 51:32.923
What I was gonna do when it was over.

51:35.717 --> 51:38.262
But I guess that's it, you know.

51:40.180 --> 51:43.517
I think that might be the hardest part,
the silence.

51:46.895 --> 51:49.063
The silence when the gunfire ends.

51:50.857 --> 51:51.983
How do...

51:52.526 --> 51:54.069
How do you live in that?

51:56.571 --> 51:58.782
I guess...

51:58.865 --> 52:01.201
I guess that's what
you're trying to figure out, huh?

52:02.661 --> 52:04.246
It's what you guys are doing.

52:04.829 --> 52:06.122
You're working on it.

52:08.333 --> 52:09.626
I respect that.

52:11.253 --> 52:12.379
I just...

52:17.717 --> 52:18.843
Um...

52:20.887 --> 52:25.434
If you're gonna look at yourself,
really look in the mirror, you gotta...

52:25.517 --> 52:27.352
yeah, you gotta admit who you are.

52:27.894 --> 52:33.066
But not just to yourself, you gotta...
admit it to everybody else.

52:35.277 --> 52:38.488
First time, as long as I can remember,
I don't have a war to fight.

52:40.365 --> 52:43.743
And I guess,
if I'm gonna be honest, I just...

52:47.121 --> 52:48.290
I'm scared.
