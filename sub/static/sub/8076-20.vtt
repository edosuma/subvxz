[theme music]

00:09.543 --> 00:11.545
Roseanne, you look different.

00:11.579 --> 00:12.446
I mean good different.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.614
Did you cut your hair?

00:13.647 --> 00:14.515
No.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.185
I've washed it.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.819
After a week in the
hospital like that,

00:18.852 --> 00:22.156
my hair developed a permanent
ledge in the back there.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.725
I got the cutest present
for Darlene's baby.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.328
You know how a new outfit
always makes a girl feel better.

00:27.361 --> 00:30.164
Oh it's so cute.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.032
Look at that.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.201
Oh my god.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.669
That is so cute that
it's almost worth me

00:35.703 --> 00:39.640
dropping 200 pounds
to fit into it.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.142
Well, Fred's got Andy tonight.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.576
So you want me to go
to hospital with you?

00:42.610 --> 00:43.611
No.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.646
I want everybody to
have a night off.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.815
I sent Darlene and
David out for dinner.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.483
I told them, go
ahead and enjoy it.

00:49.517 --> 00:50.718
This one of the
last times you'll

00:50.751 --> 00:53.121
ever go to dinner
without a cup of crayons

00:53.154 --> 00:54.922
sitting on the table.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.056
That's a good idea.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.092
Everybody has been under
a lot of stress lately.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.694
I just want everybody
to go out and have fun.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.995
Fun.
Yeah.

01:02.029 --> 01:02.963
Gee.

01:02.996 --> 01:05.766
What did I used to do for fun?

01:05.799 --> 01:06.634
Oh yeah.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.569
I came here.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.304
Well hey, if you're
feeling desperate,

01:10.338 --> 01:13.874
you can go down to Chuck E
Cheese with Dan and Jerry.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.277
You know, I find you're
never too old to dive head

01:16.310 --> 01:19.713
first into a roomful
of plastic balls.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.915
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.751
Any word on how soon
the baby comes home?

01:23.784 --> 01:24.685
No.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.254
The doctors say
she's doing fine.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.756
But it could still be
a whole other month.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.158
That's got to be rough on you.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.459
You've got to wait
for four whole weeks

01:31.492 --> 01:32.860
now to spoil her rotten.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.262
Jackie, I really
don't plan on being

01:34.295 --> 01:36.697
one of those grandmothers
whose entire life is

01:36.730 --> 01:38.199
about her grandchildren.

01:38.232 --> 01:41.469
Roseanne, open up the coat.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.370
What?

01:42.403 --> 01:43.771
Just open up the coat.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.745
Now hand me the bag.
- No.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.746
Hand me the bag.

01:52.780 --> 01:53.647
Hand me the bag.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.356
How did that get in there?

02:02.390 --> 02:07.127
THEME MUSIC: If what doesn't
kill us is making us stronger,

02:07.161 --> 02:12.132
we're gonna last longer than
that greatest Wall in China

02:12.166 --> 02:15.636
or that rabbit with a drum.

02:15.669 --> 02:20.374
If there's one thing that
I learned while waiting

02:20.408 --> 02:23.611
for my turn, it's
that in each life

02:23.644 --> 02:28.081
some rain falls but
you also get some sun.

02:28.115 --> 02:31.084
And we'll make out
better than OK.

02:31.118 --> 02:34.588
Hey, hear what I say.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.525
Yeah, any day.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.067
[cackle]

02:47.100 --> 02:51.572
[music playing]

02:51.605 --> 02:53.341
Deej, what the
hell are you doing?

02:53.374 --> 02:55.042
I'm ironing my shirt.

02:55.075 --> 02:58.078
Not all of us pick out our
clothes by sniffing them.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.213
No, idiot.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.514
You don't want to spray
so close to the shirt.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.416
You want to mist
it, not soak it.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.751
How do you know so
much about ironing?

03:03.784 --> 03:06.019
Hey.
What are you, calling me a girl?

03:06.053 --> 03:07.221
Look, look, look.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.121
Let me do that for you.

03:08.155 --> 03:08.956
OK?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.561
So what are you
doing tonight, man?

03:13.594 --> 03:15.463
I got an extra ticket to
Championship Wrestling.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.764
You know, Becky
thinks it's stupid.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.232
But you don't.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.132
Do you, partner?

03:19.166 --> 03:20.033
Sorry, partner.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.335
I've got plans with Heather.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.271
Oh, a little wrestling
match of your own.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.538
Huh?

03:24.572 --> 03:25.673
No.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.808
We're going to go see
"Return of the Jedi."

03:27.841 --> 03:29.743
Then you're
going to need this.

03:29.777 --> 03:33.314
I already have a wallet.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.448
No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.816
A love glove.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.285
A raincoat.

03:37.318 --> 03:41.221
An envelope for the night
security deposit box.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.290
You mean a condom?

03:42.323 --> 03:43.190
Well, yeah.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.825
If you want to get technical.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.561
Look, we're not at that
stage in our relationship.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.129
DJ, you're a guy.

03:49.162 --> 03:53.033
You're always at that
stage in your relationship.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.669
Let's just hope the
Force is with you.

03:55.703 --> 03:58.639
[music playing]

03:58.672 --> 04:01.141
[door bell]

04:01.174 --> 04:02.610
Hello, you two.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.612
Come right on in.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.080
Ah.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.449
Oh it is fantastic.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.953
What did you bring us?

04:12.986 --> 04:17.525
A bag of Kenyan Sumatra beans
and a flourless chocolate cake.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.659
To die.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.694
Oh I just love you boys.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.797
You have such a flair.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.132
Well, you know, Bev.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.835
We must admit we are more
than a little curious to meet

04:27.868 --> 04:29.169
your new special friend.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.103
Yes.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.171
Yes.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.375
Well, Joyce is dying
to meet you, too.

04:34.408 --> 04:38.479
I can't wait to see
what she picked up.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.213
She's probably some big butch.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.452
Let's face it.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.854
Deb's only been with
men up until now.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.522
Well, that doesn't
mean anything.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.490
Look at me.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.191
Oh stop.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.826
So where is Joyce?

04:52.860 --> 04:54.695
Oh, she'll be out in a minute.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.830
She's just putting
on some lipstick.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.333
(WHISPERING) Lipstick.

04:59.367 --> 05:02.235
Joyce, get your hot
little patootie out here.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.945
Fasten your seat belts.

05:11.979 --> 05:16.450
It's going to be a bumpy night.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.818
Oh my God, Leon.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.152
Look.
It's her.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.521
Oh my God.
I don't believe it.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.455
It's her.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.391
Oh yes, Joyce.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.993
Joyce the Velvet Voice
from the rotating lounge

05:26.026 --> 05:29.162
on top of the Holiday Inn.

05:29.196 --> 05:32.933
Bev, why didn't you tell us
that you were seeing Lanford's

05:32.966 --> 05:34.835
most fabulous chanteuse?

05:34.868 --> 05:35.736
Oh.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.171
Then you've seen my show?

05:38.205 --> 05:40.240
Are you kidding?
We adore you.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.775
Darling, I can't
count the times

05:41.809 --> 05:43.176
we have gone to the
Windows on Lanford

05:43.210 --> 05:45.779
lounge high atop the fourth
floor of the fantastic

05:45.813 --> 05:47.748
Holiday Inn and
watch you literally

05:47.781 --> 05:51.284
tear the roof off the place.

05:51.318 --> 05:55.656
And the way you do
"Send in the Clowns."

05:55.689 --> 06:00.861
Honey, I have not been able
to go back to the circus.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.964
And the finale when you do
"The Wind Beneath My Wings"

06:03.997 --> 06:04.998
and they turn the fans on you.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.400
Oh.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.402
And your arms go up and you've
got those little sequined wings

06:08.436 --> 06:09.302
sewn into your sleeves?

06:09.336 --> 06:11.304
Well, that is when
the waterworks

06:11.338 --> 06:13.807
open for me, darling.

06:13.841 --> 06:14.975
It is genius.

06:15.008 --> 06:19.012
It is just genius.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.449
You are so nice.

06:21.482 --> 06:26.854
Bev, they're not catty at all.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.156
[music playing]

06:30.858 --> 06:31.792
Boy.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.026
Is the Lanford
Armory the greatest

06:33.060 --> 06:35.763
place to see wrestling or what?

06:35.796 --> 06:39.166
I forgot the rodeo
was here last week.

06:39.199 --> 06:42.436
I got a gut full of nachos
and a giant foam finger.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.604
I'm ready to rumble.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.442
I think tonight's going
to be my night, Jackie.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.944
I can't wait to
get into that ring.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.646
- You can do that?
- Yeah, sure.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.014
What you do, you fill
out a card and they

06:54.047 --> 06:56.416
pick a different audience
member every week.

06:56.450 --> 06:57.317
Not to worry.

06:57.350 --> 06:58.486
I filled out one for you.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.220
Sounds dangerous.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.188
No, no, no, no.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.155
Maybe for some guys.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.290
But check out these guns.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.291
Yeah, right.

07:04.324 --> 07:07.895
You've got to be a
little bit afraid.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.164
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for the Fabulous

07:11.198 --> 07:12.900
Ladies of Wrestling.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.302
[applause]

07:15.335 --> 07:18.171
Our first match of the
evening entering the ring.

07:18.205 --> 07:21.308
Three-time Tri-State
Federation Champion,

07:21.341 --> 07:25.278
straight from her appearance
on "Sally Jesse Raphael,"

07:25.312 --> 07:28.248
she's ripped, rock-climbed,
and ready for action.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.218
Cincinnati Patty Nonoco.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.219
[cheers]

07:32.252 --> 07:33.687
And her opponent.

07:33.721 --> 07:36.156
Wanted in 13 states
for illegal moves

07:36.189 --> 07:37.658
both in and out of the ring.

07:37.691 --> 07:42.095
A terrifying display of
feminine evil, Barb the Widow.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.532
[boos]

07:49.069 --> 07:50.538
I want a piece of you.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.974
I want a piece of you.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.944
[music playing]

07:56.977 --> 07:59.479
Deej, check out
that Yoda over there.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.014
That's a homeless guy.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.522
How many dogs did he have
to kill to make that outfit?

08:08.556 --> 08:10.858
Don't people have lives?

08:10.891 --> 08:12.660
Apparently not.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.661
Do you want your lightsaber?

08:13.694 --> 08:14.494
Yeah.

08:16.897 --> 08:17.831
Careful, DJ.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.033
That's not a toy.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.935
This movie starts
in like 10 minutes.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.971
We're going to have
nosebleed seats.

08:24.004 --> 08:24.872
Hi.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.139
Two for "Return of the Jedi?"

08:26.173 --> 08:27.941
Sorry.
Sold out.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.510
Oh no.

08:30.544 --> 08:34.414
We have plenty seats available
for "Beautician and the Beast."

08:34.447 --> 08:35.348
Crap.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.751
What are we going to do now?

08:37.785 --> 08:40.053
Well, we can rent this movie.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.188
And your mom's not home.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.327
So then what happened?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.798
Well, I just told her that
if she was going to carry on

08:50.831 --> 08:54.234
like that with the band, no way
we were going to live together.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.936
I just cannot believe it.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.106
You and Edie Gorme
were roommates.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.074
Oh that's nothing.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.076
Tell them about the time
you and Mitzi Gaynor

09:03.110 --> 09:06.013
got into a fistfight at the
"South Pacific" callbacks.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.049
Oh, Mitzi Gaynor dish.

09:09.082 --> 09:09.950
Do tell.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.284
Every juicy bit.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.185
Everything.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.253
Well, I would.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.922
But I've just won another hand.

09:14.955 --> 09:15.823
Gin.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.057
You are impossible.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.191
You're no fun.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.092
Oh, Joyce.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.728
You are a lucky woman.

09:20.761 --> 09:24.564
Oh, you can say
that again, Debbie.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.835
Scotty, how cute are they?

09:27.868 --> 09:29.502
Bev, we've got
to hand it to you.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.905
Joyce is really something.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.474
A great singer,
divine card player,

09:34.507 --> 09:37.177
and a mouth like a sailor.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.312
If only I were a woman.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.814
But you're not.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.315
No.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.918
Listen, I'm not
against giving you boys

09:44.952 --> 09:47.220
a chance to win a game or two.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.722
Why don't we play
something else?

09:48.756 --> 09:49.657
Your choice.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.791
Oh, Joyce.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.426
You are going to live
to regret those words.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.628
What am I missing?

09:54.662 --> 09:56.029
Oh nothing at all.

09:56.063 --> 10:00.634
Just that Leon and I were a Fire
Island Canasta Champions 1985.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.135
- Really?
- Thank you.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.536
Then how's about
we make things

10:03.570 --> 10:04.738
a little more interesting?

10:04.772 --> 10:05.639
All right.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.174
Anything but strip poker.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.310
I haven't waxed.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.145
What do you say
we raise the stakes?

10:12.179 --> 10:13.847
Well, he's raised
the stakes before.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.218
Naughty.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.119
So, Joyce.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.420
Have you met Roseanne yet?

10:20.453 --> 10:24.357
Is she out of her coma?

10:24.391 --> 10:25.458
Who wants coffee?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.234
This is so stupid.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.602
What?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.971
I mean this whole thing with
Princess Leia and Han Solo.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.707
I mean they obviously
want each other,

10:39.740 --> 10:41.374
but they don't even
do anything about it.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.743
Yeah.

10:42.776 --> 10:46.579
Well, she's not exactly sending
him any signals or anything.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.348
That's why it's so lame.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.417
I mean here are, these
two total outcasts.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.786
They have no one in the
world except each other

10:52.820 --> 10:55.055
and they're playing these
stupid junior high games.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.156
I mean, I just don't buy it.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.629
Maybe he's just waiting for
her to do something first.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.997
Think about it.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.933
Let's say there was
this really hot girl

11:05.966 --> 11:08.268
and you really liked her.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.271
And you know that she liked
you back plus the fact

11:11.304 --> 11:13.006
that you could die any second.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.208
Wouldn't you just want to push
the Wookie off the console

11:15.242 --> 11:16.043
and do it?

11:20.347 --> 11:22.315
Right there.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.217
They had the perfect
chance and did nothing.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.052
I just think that--

11:29.022 --> 11:32.793
[music playing]

11:35.062 --> 11:35.929
[cheers]

11:35.963 --> 11:37.264
JACKIE: Hit her with the chair.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.165
Pig!

11:38.198 --> 11:39.632
You're a pig!

11:39.666 --> 11:41.368
I'll rip your
head off your neck

11:41.401 --> 11:42.936
and pull your lungs out
through your shoulders,

11:42.970 --> 11:47.407
you little, you little stain.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.943
Now you got her all riled up.

11:49.977 --> 11:50.844
Yeah.

11:50.878 --> 11:51.845
It'll throw her off her game.

11:51.879 --> 11:52.913
I hate her.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.815
Hey, I can smell your
breath from here.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.284
ANNOUNCER: Attention
to Mark Healy.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.719
Mr. Mark Healy.

11:59.753 --> 12:00.720
[screaming]

12:00.754 --> 12:02.189
This is beautiful.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.190
I got picked.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.325
Hey, prepare to die, you bag.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.593
ANNOUNCER: Telephone call.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.962
Please pick up the
courtesy phone.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.598
Mr. Mark Healy, you
have a telephone call.

12:11.631 --> 12:12.665
Damn.

12:12.699 --> 12:15.002
I hope nothing is
wrong at the hospital.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.137
Aw, who's calling, baby?

12:17.170 --> 12:18.605
Your mama?

12:18.638 --> 12:20.540
[maniacal laugh]

12:20.573 --> 12:23.410
[music playing]

12:25.946 --> 12:26.814
MARK: Yeah.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.381
This is Mark Healy.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.282
It's DJ.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.617
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah.

12:30.650 --> 12:31.651
What's up, Deej?
Look.

12:31.684 --> 12:32.786
This better be good.

12:32.820 --> 12:33.854
Because if they call my
name here and I miss it,

12:33.887 --> 12:35.488
you're dead meat.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.124
- Do you still have that condom?
- I can't hear you.

12:37.157 --> 12:37.724
What?
- What is it?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.159
What?
What?

12:39.192 --> 12:41.728
I said, do you
still have that con--

12:41.761 --> 12:43.763
do you have that glove?

12:43.797 --> 12:44.764
You know?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.199
He's looking for his gloves.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.134
Oh, I hate that.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.669
It's worse when
you just lose one.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.204
DJ, I have no idea
where your gloves are.

12:51.238 --> 12:54.107
Why don't you try
the hall closet?

12:54.141 --> 12:55.508
Oh, wait a minute.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.409
The glove.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.310
Oh yeah.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.478
It's in my wallet.

12:58.511 --> 12:59.712
Wait a minute.

12:59.746 --> 13:03.250
Well, there's another
package in Papa Bear's den.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.385
What the hell are
you talking about?

13:05.418 --> 13:06.486
Your dad's sock drawer.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.687
Papa Bear's den.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.489
How do you know
there's one there?

13:09.522 --> 13:11.691
Everybody knows that's
where bears stash them, man.

13:11.724 --> 13:14.627
That's where me and Goldilocks
used to find them all the time.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.695
All right.

13:15.728 --> 13:16.696
No problem, baby bear.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.899
Later.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.200
You're sure that
everything is OK?

13:20.233 --> 13:21.101
Yeah.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.202
DJ just wanted a condom.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.171
What?

13:24.204 --> 13:27.674
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight's lucky audience winner

13:27.707 --> 13:31.144
is Jackie Harris.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.614
Are you ready to wrestle?

13:34.647 --> 13:35.615
What?

13:35.648 --> 13:36.516
Why?

13:36.549 --> 13:38.385
[music playing]

13:38.418 --> 13:39.286
OK, boys.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.787
Read them and weep.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.789
Oh no.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.226
Where in the world did you
learn to play cards like that?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.127
Oh, darling.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.028
Please.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.397
All those years I spent in Reno.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.433
I mean after the show is over,
there is nothing to do but play

13:53.466 --> 13:55.268
cards or hit the buffets.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.470
Well, you must give us a
chance to win some of our money

13:57.504 --> 13:58.906
back.
- What do you have in mind?

13:58.939 --> 14:00.507
No.
No more cards.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.608
Please.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.377
I'm going to be seeing
queens in my sleep.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.114
Well now you sound
like my Scotty.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.681
Oh, will you be quiet?

14:08.715 --> 14:09.950
You have quite a
cheeky attitude.

14:09.983 --> 14:10.850
Wait a minute.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.619
I have an idea.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.254
I have an idea, boys.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.424
How about we have a show
tune trivia challenge?

14:17.457 --> 14:18.758
Yes.
Hear, hear.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.327
That sounds like fun.
Who goes first?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.028
- Oh, me.
- No, no, no.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.029
Come on.
- No, Leon.

14:22.062 --> 14:22.930
Leon's wonderful.
- I will.

14:22.963 --> 14:23.663
I will.
- Yes.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.597
OK.

14:24.631 --> 14:25.498
Help me, honey.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.000
Oh, the "Night Music" one.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.969
Yes, good.

14:29.002 --> 14:32.172
What tune was cut from
"A Little Night Music?"

14:32.205 --> 14:34.474
Out of town
tryouts or Broadway?

14:34.507 --> 14:35.308
Hello.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.146
Damn.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.314
She is good.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.083
Anyone for martinis?

14:43.116 --> 14:44.084
Great idea, Bev.

14:44.117 --> 14:44.985
I will make them.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.319
I will make them.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.854
Scotty, are you having?

14:47.887 --> 14:48.956
I thought you'd never ask.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.890
And you're only having
one tonight, Mr.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.160
Mr. Stick in the Mud.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.894
How about you, Joyce?

14:54.928 --> 14:56.563
You know what I'd love?

14:56.596 --> 14:58.665
A big fat bourbon.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.233
You go, girl.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.935
How do you like it?

15:01.969 --> 15:04.671
I like my whiskey
like I like my women.

15:04.704 --> 15:08.841
Smooth bodied and well aged.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.611
[music playing]

15:14.014 --> 15:15.182
Sock drawer.
Sock drawer.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.383
Which one is the sock drawer?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.918
Oh, I'm not thinking about
my parents having sex.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.853
I'm not thinking about
my parents having sex.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.755
Ho-Ho.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.191
Ho-Ho.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.025
Ho-Ho.

15:28.861 --> 15:32.032
"TV Guide 40th
Anniversary Issue."

15:32.065 --> 15:33.800
It's a special
collector's edition?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.739
Hey, my old water gun.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.675
So that's where he put it.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.777
He has his own TV
remote in here?

15:44.811 --> 15:45.612
What is that?

15:49.316 --> 15:53.520
"To my dearest Dan,
thanks for everything.

15:53.553 --> 15:56.056
Julie Newmar."

15:56.089 --> 16:00.127
Hmm, Julie Newmar.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.628
[music playing]

16:01.661 --> 16:02.929
Ever since-- no.
Wait a minute.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.231
That's too low.
Wait, wait, wait.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.298
Find your key.

16:05.332 --> 16:09.369
(SINGING) Ever since
this world began,

16:09.402 --> 16:17.110
there is nothing sadder
than a one-man woman

16:17.144 --> 16:21.681
looking for a man who got away.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.189
[laughter]

16:29.222 --> 16:30.190
[inaudible]

16:30.223 --> 16:33.193
I just sang with Joyce.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.094
Oh, Leon.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.595
You have a fabulous voice.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.031
Oh honey, you should hear him
sing "Don't Rain on My Parade."

16:38.065 --> 16:38.931
Scott, please.

16:38.965 --> 16:39.832
Please.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.468
Honey, you can
come to the club

16:41.501 --> 16:42.802
and sing any time you want.

16:42.835 --> 16:43.770
No, no, no, no, no.

16:43.803 --> 16:44.904
You are the diva.
I'm an amateur.

16:44.937 --> 16:45.972
I'm just an amateur.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.574
There is one star
when you're on stage.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.475
That's it.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.476
You're it, sweetheart.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.878
Who wants another martini?

16:51.911 --> 16:53.780
(CHEERING) Martinis.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.248
I'll have two.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.149
All right.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.384
But listen, people.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.918
Joyce may be the singer but--

16:58.951 --> 17:00.053
Ah.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.155
Leon, I told you.

17:02.189 --> 17:05.725
Three is your limit tonight.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.961
You remember what happened
at the YMCA fundraiser.

17:08.995 --> 17:11.364
Everyone was
taking something off.

17:11.398 --> 17:14.967
But we haven't been allowed
back in the Olympic pool since.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.337
I hate that place.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.538
I hate that place anyway.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.673
That's where that
man was so cruel.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.809
Joyce may be the singer.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.811
My hat's off to you.
JOYCE: Thank you.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.613
But can she dance?

17:28.014 --> 17:30.450
(SINGING) Da-da-da.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.018
Come on.

17:32.051 --> 17:32.919
Come on.

17:32.952 --> 17:34.321
Get in here, too, big guy.

17:38.858 --> 17:39.826
We got it.

17:39.859 --> 17:40.827
We got it.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.295
We should have a group.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.996
What a wonderful idea.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.466
We could call ourselves
Four Girls Four.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.334
Yes.

17:47.367 --> 17:52.939
Girls with a Z.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.441
Kill her, Jackie.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.942
Give her the eye gouge.

17:55.975 --> 17:57.410
I used to be a cop.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.845
I used to be a cop.

18:02.682 --> 18:03.616
[cheering]

18:03.650 --> 18:06.353
MARK: That's it
Now you've got her.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.854
Jackie, let me in there.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.356
Let me in there.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.357
Let me in.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.191
Let me.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.795
Tag me, Jackie.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.797
Tag me, Jackie.

18:17.830 --> 18:18.798
Jackie.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.767
Tag me.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.768
Tag me.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.271
Tag me, Jackie.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.738

[music playing]

18:32.745 --> 18:34.080
DJ, is something wrong?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.482
What?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.317
Well, I mean you just keep on
getting up and leaving me here.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.651
Are you trying to
tell me something?

18:38.685 --> 18:39.552
No.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.653
I was just, you know--

18:40.687 --> 18:41.854
DJ, DJ.

18:41.888 --> 18:46.259
Um, just so you know,
like for future reference,

18:46.293 --> 18:47.727
I have some condoms
in my backpack.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.133
You do?

18:54.167 --> 18:55.067
Yeah.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.069
My mom makes me
carry them around.

18:57.103 --> 19:00.807
She says it makes
her feel protected.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.576
So you ever use them?

19:03.610 --> 19:04.544
No.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.413
I was actually kind
of saving them,

19:06.446 --> 19:09.616
you know, for something special.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.683
That's a good idea.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.319
I mean, some things
ought to be special.

19:15.188 --> 19:18.491
So if you and I ever
decide to use them,

19:18.525 --> 19:20.693
I guess we'll be prepared.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.962
So you won't have to go
calling Mark or looking

19:22.995 --> 19:26.299
through your dad's drawers.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.835
That's good cause
there's nothing

19:28.868 --> 19:31.504
but Ho-Hos in there anyway.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.474
DJ, you're not upset we
didn't do anything tonight.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.642
Are you?

19:35.675 --> 19:36.909
No.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.878
Actually I'm kind of relieved.

19:38.911 --> 19:39.712
Me too.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.150
It's getting late.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.318
- I'll walk you home.
- No.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.219
That's OK.

19:46.253 --> 19:47.620
I've got my bike.

19:47.654 --> 19:48.988
OK.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.391
Well, call me as soon as you
get there so I know you're OK.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.225
All right.

[music playing]

20:09.041 --> 20:10.310
To tell you the
truth, Black Widow,

20:10.343 --> 20:11.878
I always thought those
professional wrestling

20:11.911 --> 20:13.145
matches were fake.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.281
Well, yeah.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.616
That's true for the guys
like Rowdy Roddy Piper.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.286
But when we women
fight, it's for real.

20:19.319 --> 20:23.690
Well, I guess I know that now.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.991
Hey.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.926
Listen, I'm sorry you
didn't get a crack at me.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.261
Oh, that's OK.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.129
I mean if this stuff is real,
I can see why you wouldn't

20:30.162 --> 20:31.964
want to wrestle a guy anyway.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.000
Oh yeah?
Let's go.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.968
I wouldn't do
that if I was you.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.670
You know I carry most
my strength my forearms.

20:40.273 --> 20:43.776
I got $50,000 on
the Black Widow.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.177
All right, Popeye.

20:45.211 --> 20:46.546
Let's go.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.380
OK.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.184
Now don't hold back
because I'm a woman.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.019
Ow, OK.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.457
All right.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.991
You got me, buddy.

20:59.025 --> 20:59.826
Chicks.

21:06.566 --> 21:07.434
Get that for me.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.267
Would you, DJ?

21:12.472 --> 21:14.240
I'd like to apologize
for my family.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.275
I'm sure every idiot
who meets you wants

21:16.309 --> 21:18.378
to see if they can take you.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.280
Hey, I'm--

21:21.314 --> 21:22.782
Oh my god.

21:22.815 --> 21:25.084
Black Widow.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.487
I saw you on TV.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.388
Get up, Mark.

21:28.421 --> 21:31.891
I've always wanted to do that.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.693
OK.
- All right.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.661
All right.
