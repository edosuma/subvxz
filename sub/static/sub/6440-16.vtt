00:06.080 --> 00:08.720
How much will you give me for it?

00:09.520 --> 00:10.920
Fifty bucks.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.760
It's made out of gold.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.079
- Who told you that?
- My mother.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.760
Tell her it's a fake.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.280
I can't.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.400
She's dead.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.400
I'll give you sixty bucks.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.760
So, what's the deal?

01:01.920 --> 01:05.680
- I don't want to do this anymore.
- Oh, this is our last job.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.800
Liar.

01:09.720 --> 01:12.200
We're all you've got, kid.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.320
Tell me the combination.

01:18.040 --> 01:21.200
25-13-29.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.400
Good boy.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.880
Okay, you know the drill, right?

01:32.160 --> 01:36.320
- Let's do this.
- Get the bag. Let's go.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.280
Don't forget my angel.

02:05.880 --> 02:09.199
What's going on here?
Hey, who are you people?

02:09.360 --> 02:11.720
Oh, my God, no! No!

02:14.200 --> 02:16.400
Oh, my God, I think he's dead.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.360
- Let's go!
- No. What did you do that for?

02:19.520 --> 02:22.440
It was him or us, baby. We gotta go!

02:22.600 --> 02:24.240
Come on.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.160
Where's he going? Go.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.840
Ryan!

02:52.640 --> 02:54.920
Oh, my God.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.960
Are you all right?

03:03.760 --> 03:06.680
- Are you all right?
- I lost my shoe.

03:06.840 --> 03:10.280
I'm taking you to the hospital. Come on.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.160
Stray

04:22.480 --> 04:24.800
He checks out physically,
just scrapes and bruises.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.040
Have you managed
to contact his parents yet?

04:27.400 --> 04:30.680
Other than knowing his name,
Ryan claims to have no memory.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.440
Are you saying he has amnesia?

04:32.600 --> 04:35.960
True amnesia is extremely rare.
It's most likely post-traumatic shock.

04:36.520 --> 04:40.400
His memory will probably return
within 24 to 48 hours.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.760
What if it doesn't?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.280
Martha, Jonathan.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.920
It's unlikely all Ryan's cuts and bruises
were caused by the accident.

04:54.080 --> 04:58.600
- You think he's been abused?
- He may not want to remember.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.320
What will happen to him?

05:00.480 --> 05:02.840
We've called Child Services,
but they're understaffed...

05:03.000 --> 05:05.200
...and can't come
until tomorrow at the earliest.

05:05.360 --> 05:09.240
So the only place for Ryan to stay is at
the juvenile cell at the sheriff's station.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.760
- That's no place for a child.
- Why can't he come home with us?

05:13.160 --> 05:15.240
- That's a great idea.
- Can we do that?

05:15.840 --> 05:18.360
I'll have to make some calls,
but I don't see why not.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.920
It'd be a big help to us,
and I'm sure Ryan would appreciate it.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.000
- Clark?
- It's me, Mrs. Kent.

05:33.160 --> 05:37.560
- Ryan, did you do all this?
- I hope you don't mind. I couldn't sleep.

05:38.640 --> 05:43.640
- Hey, what's the occasion?
- I wanted to make myself useful.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.920
- Thanks for letting me stay here.
- Stay as long as you want.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.840
Maybe some of you
will rub off on Clark.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.120
What does everybody want?
Let me guess...

05:53.280 --> 05:54.880
...pancakes...

05:57.360 --> 06:00.440
...with powdered sugar...

06:01.600 --> 06:03.000
...not syrup.

06:03.240 --> 06:07.240
- How did you know that?
- You eyed them when you came in.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.560
Scrambled eggs...

06:09.920 --> 06:11.440
...bacon...

06:11.640 --> 06:15.040
...coffee with milk
and a little bit of honey.

06:15.400 --> 06:19.040
Well, that is some trick there, kiddo.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.520
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.520
Going all out for the new kid, huh?

06:22.680 --> 06:25.440
Actually, Clark,
Ryan took care of all this himself.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.160
You're making me look bad.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.680
What do you want for breakfast?

06:32.760 --> 06:36.920
- Don't you want anything, Clark?
- I'm just gonna have some pancakes.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.920
Ryan, you okay?

06:43.000 --> 06:46.280
Ryan, are you sure you don't remember
anything about last night?

06:46.440 --> 06:48.600
You see, because
I still can't figure out...

06:48.800 --> 06:51.960
...why you were out on Route 90
at 10:00 at night.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.760
I said I don't remember.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.240
I'm not hiding anything.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.800
No one said you were, buddy.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.640
Guess your parents want me
to leave now.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.920
- Why would you think that?
- Because they don't believe me.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.400
- We just want to help you get home.
- What if I don't have a home?

07:31.760 --> 07:34.360
What if you found out I did bad things?
What would happen?

07:34.520 --> 07:37.880
Ryan, everything's
gonna work out. I know it.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.840
You like comics?

07:43.160 --> 07:44.880
I like this one.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.680
Warrior Angel. Why him?

07:47.200 --> 07:50.360
Because he protects people
who can't protect themselves.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.440
I like being around you, Clark.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.240
It's peaceful.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.920
Why don't you get your head out
of that comic and play a little ball?

08:25.200 --> 08:29.560
- I know what you're thinking. I suck.
- Nothing a little practice can't cure.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.880
Go ahead. Get your hand up,
keep your elbows straight...

08:33.039 --> 08:36.480
...just guide the ball with your fingers.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.200
- He shoots, and he scores!
- Yeah.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.679
Nice.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.720
Excuse me.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.080
- Yes.
- I'm looking for the boy from the paper.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.360
You know, the one who lost his memory.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.720
- And you are?
- A private detective.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.720
I work for a couple who lost their son.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.720
Is Ryan still around?

09:02.600 --> 09:03.720
No...

09:03.880 --> 09:08.120
...but if you wait, I'll get Dr. Harden.
I know she'd like to speak with you.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.440
All right.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.600
That's a great sound, isn't it?

09:28.960 --> 09:31.960
Yeah, it is.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.680
Do you ever think we made the wrong
decision, not adopting another child?

09:41.960 --> 09:45.280
Maybe sharing his secret with
a younger brother would have helped.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.960
He seems to really like Ryan.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.680
I don't think he's the only one.

09:50.840 --> 09:56.440
- You always had a soft spot for strays.
- Well, the last one turned out all right.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.320
Here you go. One more.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.160
Oh, nice.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.160
I thought you were still in Monaco.

10:09.320 --> 10:13.560
"The backbone of surprise
is fusing speed with secrecy."

10:13.720 --> 10:16.480
Von Clausevitz, On War.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.840
Isn't that a little '80s, Dad,
even for you?

10:19.000 --> 10:23.240
I never give my plant managers
a heads-up before a spot inspection.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.120
What could you possibly have
to complain about now?

10:26.280 --> 10:29.120
The plant's doing well,
LuthorCorp stock is up...

10:29.280 --> 10:31.440
I'm not here to complain, Lex.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.800
On the contrary.
Your performance lately has been...

10:38.240 --> 10:39.840
...more than adequate.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.800
That sounds dangerously
like a compliment.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.840
I push you, Lex, I don't deny it.

10:48.040 --> 10:52.000
Greatness is a rarefied air
one has to be taught to breathe.

10:52.160 --> 10:58.360
Philip of Macedonia raised his son
among lions to instill fearlessness in him.

10:58.520 --> 11:01.760
Didn't he also try
to impale the kid with a spear?

11:01.920 --> 11:04.200
In an aborted coup attempt...

11:04.360 --> 11:08.120
...but history remembers that boy
as Alexander the Great.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.560
You didn't come all this way
to lecture me on Greek history.

11:11.720 --> 11:16.560
No. I want you to come back
to Metropolis...

11:17.200 --> 11:22.400
...where you will hold the position
"advisor to the chairman emeritus."

11:22.560 --> 11:25.000
That would be me.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.040
- At least the title sounds important.
- It's not just a title. It's an opportunity.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.560
It's what you've been waiting for
ever since you came to Smallville.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.360
I'll think about it.

11:35.680 --> 11:39.920
You want to keep me dangling, so it
looks like you're granting me a favour...

11:40.080 --> 11:42.720
...instead of receiving one?

11:44.720 --> 11:48.360
We don't need to play games, son.

11:48.560 --> 11:53.160
Dad, games are all we've got.

11:56.480 --> 12:00.440
- You're a modern-day Kaspar Hauser.
- Who's that?

12:00.600 --> 12:03.600
Don't worry. Chloe's the queen
of obscure and irrelevant references.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.360
He's a kid from the 19th century
with amnesia.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.440
He showed up in a German town
without a memory of who he was...

12:09.600 --> 12:11.840
...all he could remember was his name.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.120
- What happened to him?
- His story spread throughout Europe...

12:15.280 --> 12:18.360
...and people from all over came to see
if he was their missing child.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.320
Some people thought
he was the lost son of the grand duke.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.720
- Did he ever find his parents?
- You know...

12:29.800 --> 12:31.280
Yeah, he did.

12:33.160 --> 12:37.800
He found his parents,
and they lived happily ever after.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.880
Why didn't you just say
he was murdered?

12:43.480 --> 12:45.480
How did you know that?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.480
You know, why don't we take
that picture?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.760
What picture?

12:54.280 --> 12:56.800
You're not putting me
on that freak wall, are you?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.840
It's called the Wall of Weird,
and no...

12:59.000 --> 13:02.400
...this picture is just to check against
missing persons.

13:03.840 --> 13:07.680
Okay, I'm gonna go download this.
I'll be there in a sec.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.960
- She likes you.
- Yeah, we're friends.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.840
She wants to be more than just friends.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.560
- She wants you to ask her to the prom.
- Chloe?

13:23.360 --> 13:25.360
- Yeah, right.
- No, really.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.640
She already picked out a dress. It's pink.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.840
Ryan, you just met Chloe,
and she hates dresses...

13:33.040 --> 13:34.920
...and she's not exactly the prom type.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.280
Maybe she has a romantic side
you never knew about.

13:37.440 --> 13:41.000
Or maybe my mom hit you harder
than I thought.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.440
Let's get a picture of my boys.

13:48.080 --> 13:52.560
So how does it feel having
a little-brother-type figure in your life?

13:52.720 --> 13:55.800
- It's pretty cool.
- I dreamed of having a brother or sister...

13:55.960 --> 13:58.120
...someone to talk to,
help fill the silence.

13:58.280 --> 14:01.240
Someone you can totally trust
and would always be there for you.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.360
That's just how I see you, Clark.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.040
Thanks.

14:12.760 --> 14:17.640
Warrior Angel. I'm a fan myself.

14:18.080 --> 14:21.280
- You must be Ryan. I'm...
- Lex Luthor.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.880
Clark told me all about you.

14:24.040 --> 14:27.600
- You know, I have one of the...
- First-edition panels in your house.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.320
- How did you know that?
- You're rich.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.800
That's what rich people do, collect stuff.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.520
I see you've met Ryan.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.080
Apparently, we're both big
Warrior Angel fans.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.840
I didn't know you liked comic books.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.600
A strange visitor from another planet
who protects the weak?

14:45.920 --> 14:48.840
When I was young, he was my idol,
not to mention he's bald.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.520
I have the whole collection.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.480
- Maybe we'll come by and check it out.
- Yeah.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.280
- Would you like that, buddy?
- Whatever.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.640
Whatever.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.960
That was kind of rude.

15:05.120 --> 15:09.400
- Lex is my friend.
- Don't worry. He's going to leave.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.760
Lex's father offered him a new job.

15:11.920 --> 15:15.760
You don't know Lex's father.
He would never do that.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.480
You have to stop making up
stories about people.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.960
I'll see you in a minute.

16:15.280 --> 16:16.720
Ryan?

16:17.480 --> 16:21.480
Ryan just took off out the back.
He looked scared, Clark.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.160
Ryan?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.000
Help!

17:18.240 --> 17:19.839
Help!

17:20.040 --> 17:22.280
Help!

17:38.960 --> 17:41.320
You're safe now.

17:49.200 --> 17:53.440
Clark, where's your young sidekick?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.240
Sleeping.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.080
He thinks you're his big brother.

17:58.240 --> 18:02.880
Yeah, well, I guess I am,
till tomorrow.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.840
- The kid is growing on you.
- You know how it is.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.560
Being an only child, no one else around.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.200
Don't you ever wish you had a sibling?

18:12.520 --> 18:14.320
I had one, Clark.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.040
Really? I didn't know.

18:18.360 --> 18:21.560
When I was 11,
my mother got pregnant again.

18:21.720 --> 18:26.000
It was a total surprise.
I've never seen my father happier.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.240
The day Julian was born
was the only time...

18:28.400 --> 18:30.920
...I felt like I was part of a real family.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.080
And what happened?

18:33.400 --> 18:37.080
The morning of his baptism,
my mother went to his nursery...

18:37.240 --> 18:40.880
...found him in his crib,
he had stopped breathing.

18:42.160 --> 18:46.840
My mother was never the same,
and my father got even more distant.

18:47.400 --> 18:51.600
I think he saw Julian
as his second chance.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.320
A chance for him to have a son
he could truly love.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.920
I'm sorry.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.640
It's in the past, Clark.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.920
We would have ended up
hating each other, anyway.

19:06.120 --> 19:09.040
My father would have seen to that.

19:10.280 --> 19:15.280
But I didn't come over
to recount my family's tragic history.

19:15.560 --> 19:18.840
My father has offered me a chance
to return to Metropolis.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.360
Did you tell Ryan about that?

19:26.480 --> 19:29.560
I haven't told anyone, Clark.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.920
Well, that's what you always wanted.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.840
I used to think it was.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.800
Now I'm not so sure.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.040
I was a different person there.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.440
A different person around my father.

19:44.800 --> 19:49.440
He wants an answer tomorrow night.
We're having dinner in Metropolis.

19:51.440 --> 19:55.160
If anyone can choose
who they want to be, Lex...

19:55.320 --> 19:57.000
...it's you.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.320
- Knock, knock.
- Mr. Kent, this is a surprise.

20:08.520 --> 20:12.320
Yeah, Ryan's been doing chores with me
all day, so I figured he deserved a break.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.040
I'd like a cup of coffee,
give him whatever he wants...

20:15.200 --> 20:18.560
...and if you can point me to a phone,
I'll see if Martha wants anything.

20:18.920 --> 20:22.400
- All right, it's in the back.
- All right. Enjoy.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.680
- So how you feeling today?
- Much better, thanks.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.640
Good.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.600
Do you think it's okay
if friends have secrets?

20:31.760 --> 20:34.680
Strange question. Why do you ask?

20:35.080 --> 20:38.080
Because I think
Clark is hiding something from me.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.280
Everybody has secrets, Ryan.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.720
Really? What's yours?

20:44.000 --> 20:47.720
If I told you, then it wouldn't be
a secret.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.040
I guess you're right.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.920
- Thanks, Skye, you're a lifesaver.
- You're welcome.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.360
- Why the frown?
- She's not a good person, Lana.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.560
You should fire her.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.600
Ryan, why would you
say something like that?

21:13.760 --> 21:16.240
Because it's the truth.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.280
How do you know?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.040
It's a secret.

21:41.520 --> 21:44.000
Thanks for the hot chocolate, Mr. Kent.

21:46.760 --> 21:50.440
Looks like Ryan
has found himself a new family.

21:56.040 --> 22:00.000
- It's time to get back to work.
- When do we get the kid?

22:01.920 --> 22:03.800
When we're ready.

22:04.960 --> 22:08.160
My mom hit him somewhere
around here.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.240
Thanks for helping with the clue hunt.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.800
And help solve the riddle of Ryan?
It's my pleasure.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.280
There really is a riddle.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.880
I'm starting to think
he may not have amnesia.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.640
Clark, the kid adores you,
why would he lie?

22:20.960 --> 22:23.520
Because he's running from somebody.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.160
I found something.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.640
We got comic books...

22:37.800 --> 22:39.480
...and Twizzlers.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.760
Something every growing boy needs.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.480
What? It's where I would
hide something.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.840
If you were a CIA operative.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.240
Who do you think it is?

23:01.720 --> 23:04.360
I don't know... Mom, aunt?

23:04.520 --> 23:06.640
And the mystery deepens.

23:06.800 --> 23:10.000
I still can't figure out how he knew
that Kaspar Hauser was murdered.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.520
Well, you weren't exactly
wearing a poker face.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.280
Ryan does say weird things.

23:16.440 --> 23:20.920
He even said you wanted me to ask you
to prom and that you'd bought a dress.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.440
It's not pink, is it?

23:28.760 --> 23:33.880
Okay, you know, I was just looking at it,
it's not like I actually bought it.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.640
How would Ryan know that?

23:39.560 --> 23:44.280
I don't know. Maybe he's an alien
or called Miss Cleo. I don't know.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.200
Clark's the best thing
that ever happened to you.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.760
Yeah, he is.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.880
He makes up for not being able
to have your own kids.

24:00.320 --> 24:01.800
He does.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.920
- Has he always been so strong?
- What do you mean?

24:06.240 --> 24:10.040
The way he tore off the back panel
of the garbage truck and saved me.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.560
Don't be silly, he couldn't do that.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.000
If you say so.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.880
What's your greatest fear?

24:26.480 --> 24:29.680
That I won't get this pie done
by the time you have to leave.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.640
Why don't you go outside
and shoot some hoops?

25:15.240 --> 25:18.720
- What are you doing down here?
- Clark, don't be mad.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.640
How'd you know about this?

25:22.040 --> 25:24.000
I heard about it in your mom's mind.

25:28.520 --> 25:31.480
I wanted to see it for myself.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.880
Can you hear everything people think?

25:37.280 --> 25:39.880
Only what's on the surface.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.960
What they're thinking at that moment.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.360
Except for you.

25:45.760 --> 25:49.720
I can't read your mind.
That's how I knew you were different.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.680
Now I know why.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.200
I can't believe you'd do this.

25:56.520 --> 26:00.280
I'll never tell.
You keep my secret, I'll keep yours.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.840
- It's not that simple.
- Sure it is.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.960
I know your dad's worried
that people are going to find out.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.200
I can tell him
when someone's getting close.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.800
I told you about Chloe.
I can tell you about Lana.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.360
- You want to know her secret?
- No.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.960
No, Ryan, I don't.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.400
Why not?

26:19.560 --> 26:21.720
It's about you.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.560
Look, you can't do this.

26:24.200 --> 26:27.280
You don't understand
what it's like to be different.

26:27.480 --> 26:32.400
What it's like to have to hide
so people won't think you're a freak.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.760
Everywhere I go...

26:35.920 --> 26:38.720
...I hear people's thoughts.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.240
I can't block it out anymore.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.680
Is this your mother?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.600
She died.

26:57.320 --> 26:58.840
Why didn't you tell me?

26:59.400 --> 27:01.760
I was hoping I could start over
with your family.

27:02.760 --> 27:07.600
They were so nice. I wanted them
to adopt me like they did you.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.440
So I'd be safe.

27:11.520 --> 27:16.080
- Who's chasing you?
- My stepfather and his new wife.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.440
They've been using me.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.320
My abilities.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.760
To steal.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.560
I wanted to stop...

27:31.920 --> 27:34.200
...but they threatened me.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.000
They hit me.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.960
You have to protect me, Clark.
You're the only one that can.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.280
I'll get it.

28:11.280 --> 28:14.880
You say anything, and I'll kill them.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.240
You know I will.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.640
- So you must be Ryan.
- Can I help you?

28:24.880 --> 28:28.640
Mr. Kent, Child Services.
I'm here to pick up Ryan.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.320
You're early. We weren't
expecting you for an hour.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.240
We can't thank you enough
for taking Ryan in.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.160
It's our pleasure.
He's welcome to stay longer.

28:37.360 --> 28:40.400
Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible.
I need to put him in foster care.

28:40.560 --> 28:42.760
That's the law.

28:42.920 --> 28:45.440
Let's get your stuff.

28:49.400 --> 28:54.920
We think Ryan might be running away
from his stepfather. We called the police.

28:55.080 --> 28:58.480
Don't worry, we'll keep him safe.
Ready to go?

28:59.920 --> 29:03.400
Could he wait and say goodbye to our
son, Clark? He'll be home any minute.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.760
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.200
It's okay, Mrs. Kent.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.240
Just tell him thanks.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.600
If you need anything, just call us, okay?

29:28.920 --> 29:32.560
Dad, what's wrong?

29:33.600 --> 29:36.880
Child Services came and took Ryan away
about 15 minutes ago.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.480
What?

29:38.640 --> 29:41.000
Why didn't he wait for me?
I wanted to say goodbye.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.320
I don't know, son...

29:43.480 --> 29:46.480
...they said they were in a hurry.
I'm sorry.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.600
On your way to Metropolis.

30:07.920 --> 30:11.720
Yeah, for the big dinner.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.240
I...

30:13.400 --> 30:14.800
I wanted you to have something.

30:17.080 --> 30:22.720
- A sword?
- It's a foil. Every hero should have one.

30:26.480 --> 30:29.200
I guess this means
you've decided you're leaving.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.920
I haven't made up my mind
one way or the other.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.720
If you haven't made up your mind,
why give me a going-away present?

30:35.880 --> 30:38.160
Keep that away from the kid.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.720
- He's already gone.
- I'm sorry.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.920
I know how much you liked him.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.840
For what it's worth, I hope you stay.

31:35.760 --> 31:40.400
Driver? Hey, what's going on?

31:41.200 --> 31:42.720
Driver?

31:43.640 --> 31:45.560
- Inside, come on!
- What are you doing?

31:46.480 --> 31:48.480
Get in.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.080
Mr. Luthor.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.680
- Ryan?
- Shut up.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.160
Okay, go. Go.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.800
Getting the account number
to your trust fund was easy...

32:11.960 --> 32:13.360
...now give me the password.

32:13.520 --> 32:16.360
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Tell me what it is.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.280
My father has it, I don't.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.840
He's lying.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.680
Password. Now.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.240
You got it?

32:44.960 --> 32:48.880
- Hey, Zorro, what's with the sword?
- It's a foil.

32:49.040 --> 32:52.640
I'm guessing it's a gift
from our favourite millionaire playboy.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.040
He's thinking of moving back
to Metropolis.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.360
Well, I'm still here, Clark.
I'm not going anywhere.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.360
Sources at the sheriff's office have given
me a heads-up on Ryan's step dad.

33:07.680 --> 33:11.520
- You have sources.
- Yeah, a cute officer in Traffic.

33:12.040 --> 33:15.520
I talked my way out of a speeding ticket,
he told me I was plucky.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.720
Maybe I'll ask him to prom.

33:20.840 --> 33:25.560
So Ryan's step dad is a real catch.
He's a career criminal.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.040
This is Lex's limo driver.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.280
Give me the password.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.120
Don't make me ask again.

33:55.080 --> 33:57.080
It's "Julian."

34:10.719 --> 34:14.679
- Lex, are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.600
Which way did they go?

34:16.760 --> 34:21.719
Straight down Route 90.
Clark, they've got Ryan. Get some help.

34:37.800 --> 34:41.920
Get out. Torch the limo, baby!

34:44.400 --> 34:47.800
Give me that. Julian.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.880
Give me the real password.
Don't mess with me.

34:58.040 --> 35:01.160
- I'm not gonna tell you!
- I swear to God, I'll drop him right now.

35:01.320 --> 35:03.800
Once he gets the money,
he's gonna kill you.

35:05.440 --> 35:08.760
Don't listen to him.
He's talking trash to pull us apart.

35:10.080 --> 35:14.560
We're just about to hit the jackpot.
All we've gotta do is trust each other.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.120
You know, this kid has always
freaked me out...

35:17.280 --> 35:20.800
...but the one thing I'll say about him
is he never lied.

35:23.880 --> 35:25.960
You know what?!

35:27.120 --> 35:29.120
That's true...

35:29.800 --> 35:31.320
...he didn't.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.480
Ryan!

35:38.080 --> 35:40.840
- Hey, kid, where are you going?
- Call the police!

35:54.400 --> 35:56.160
Ryan!

36:02.840 --> 36:04.960
You can't hide forever.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.160
You know, your mother really hated you.

36:19.360 --> 36:22.520
Couldn't stand having a freak for a son.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.640
Come to think of it,
I wasn't that crazy about you either.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.040
- Clark!
- It's okay, buddy.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.800
You're safe now.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.920
- Hi, Lana.
- Hey.

38:29.360 --> 38:31.920
- Ryan would like to say goodbye.
- Where are you going?

38:32.120 --> 38:33.880
Edge City.

38:34.400 --> 38:38.160
Chloe's research turned up an aunt
there. She's coming by this afternoon.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.920
I wanted to thank you
for your advice on Skye.

38:41.080 --> 38:44.880
You were right.
She was stealing from the till.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.040
- Hey.
- Wow.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.320
Thank you.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.520
I think you made his year.

39:01.280 --> 39:03.720
So you recover yet?

39:04.480 --> 39:08.760
I don't know, but I'm definitely in love.

39:11.040 --> 39:13.360
Join the club.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.480
Shouldn't you be packing?

39:24.160 --> 39:27.400
I'm not going back to Metropolis.

39:27.960 --> 39:31.760
Come on, Lex, that's all you wanted
ever since I assigned you...

39:31.920 --> 39:35.280
...to what you so eloquently refer to
as the "crap factory."

39:35.440 --> 39:38.120
I know why you want me back.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.680
I'm driving you crazy, aren't I?

39:40.840 --> 39:46.480
I'm not clubbing till 6:00 a.m.,
not getting arrested. I'm on track.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.360
That's what scares you.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.720
You want me back where you can
keep an eye on me.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.200
You're making a mistake, Lex.

39:57.320 --> 40:02.240
You know what the emperors you're so
fond of talking about were afraid of?

40:02.680 --> 40:04.560
That their sons would
become successful...

40:04.720 --> 40:07.520
...and return to Rome
at the head of their own army.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.480
You think you can find
your future in Smallville.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.520
I'm your future.

40:14.720 --> 40:17.720
Join me, Lex. Join me in Metropolis.

40:17.880 --> 40:21.080
How long have you been waiting
to hear me say those words?

40:21.240 --> 40:24.960
I've waited to hear other things
from you for a lot longer.

40:27.080 --> 40:30.920
- I'll return to Metropolis when I'm ready.
- At the head of an army?

40:44.560 --> 40:46.960
We're really going to miss you, Ryan.

40:47.120 --> 40:50.840
It gets cold in Edge City,
so I packed some of Clark's old jackets...

40:51.000 --> 40:53.800
...something for you to grow into.
- Thanks, Mrs. Kent.

40:54.240 --> 40:57.080
You're welcome around here
any time you want.

40:58.600 --> 41:01.480
I know what you're worried about,
but don't be.

41:01.880 --> 41:04.440
I'll keep Clark's secret.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.760
I know what it's like to have to hide
who you are from the world.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.800
There she is.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.760
You sure you're gonna be all right?

41:24.200 --> 41:26.560
She's a nice person.

41:26.880 --> 41:29.000
She's just as nervous as I am.

41:34.600 --> 41:38.040
Are you sure you don't want to know
how Lana feels about you?

41:38.200 --> 41:40.240
I prefer to find out on my own.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.560
Clark...

41:47.200 --> 41:48.800
Be careful of Lex.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.600
I know you like him...

41:50.760 --> 41:53.240
...but there's a lot of darkness
he keeps from the world.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.960
I've seen it in his head.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.720
I like to believe in people's best.

42:02.160 --> 42:04.480
I want you to have something.

42:08.160 --> 42:12.240
- I can't take those.
- I don't need them anymore.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.520
I have you.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.520
See you.

42:33.720 --> 42:35.360
Bye.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.400
Okay.
