00:38.667 --> 00:40.699
Help me.
Help.

00:50.434 --> 00:52.932
It certainly looks like
a suicide.

00:52.934 --> 00:54.968
Yeah, uniform aren't convinced.

00:56.934 --> 00:59.565
I reckon they've got a point.

00:59.567 --> 01:01.198
How come?

01:01.200 --> 01:03.300
Well, he didn't
string himself up.

01:05.567 --> 01:08.300
And I'm betting he didn't
do that to his own face.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.365
Sarge.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.701
Rob.

02:16.934 --> 02:18.098
And this is?

02:18.100 --> 02:19.998
Billie Fitzgerald.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.065
Trainee detective constable.

02:21.067 --> 02:22.866
I've just been
transferred from CID.

02:22.868 --> 02:26.298
Acting Detective Inspector
Vivienne Cole.

02:26.300 --> 02:27.699
Do me a favor.

02:27.701 --> 02:30.367
Find out who discovered the body
and get their account, yeah?

02:33.701 --> 02:35.699
So, definitely not a suicide?

02:35.701 --> 02:38.332
No doubt about it.
He's been murdered.

02:38.334 --> 02:41.501
But why bother to make it
look like he killed himself?

02:44.934 --> 02:47.499
I hear you found the body.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.065
Can I get your name?

02:49.067 --> 02:51.332
Amber.

02:51.334 --> 02:52.934
Amber Saunders.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.699
Amber, can you tell me
what happened?

02:56.701 --> 02:59.334
Yeah, um...

03:00.334 --> 03:02.065
I was just cutting
through the park,

03:02.067 --> 03:05.432
and... and I caught sight
of something in the trees,

03:05.434 --> 03:07.300
and he was just, um...

03:09.434 --> 03:11.732
He was just
hanging there and... Sorry.

03:11.734 --> 03:15.300
You've had a terrible shock.
Don't be.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.732
I.D.?

03:24.734 --> 03:27.033
No phone, no wallet, nothing.

03:28.801 --> 03:32.532
He is covered in dry blood,
but there's no blood around him,

03:32.534 --> 03:34.232
which means
he wasn't killed here.

03:34.234 --> 03:35.866
He's been dragged through
the undergrowth

03:35.868 --> 03:37.932
and then strung up with this.

03:37.934 --> 03:40.067
Looks like
a four-meter tow rope to me.

03:42.267 --> 03:46.098
I'll need your details.
An address?

03:46.100 --> 03:51.165
Uh, yeah I... I don't
actually have an address.

03:51.167 --> 03:55.334
You can find me at the homeless
shelter in Charing Cross.

03:56.634 --> 03:58.400
What about a mobile number?

04:02.067 --> 04:05.365
What I really need is for you
to come in and make a statement.

04:05.367 --> 04:06.799
Do you think
you can manage that?

04:06.801 --> 04:08.565
Yeah.

04:08.567 --> 04:11.065
Sometime this morning maybe?

04:11.067 --> 04:12.734
Sure.

04:25.501 --> 04:28.198
- Tire tracks.
- Too wide for a car.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.966
Something like a transit van?

04:29.968 --> 04:32.432
Right let's prioritize
CCTV and AMPR

04:32.434 --> 04:34.165
on the roads around here.

04:34.167 --> 04:37.267
Find the van, there's a good
chance we'll find the killer.

04:59.934 --> 05:01.998
It's quite something
to hold a dead body up

05:02.000 --> 05:03.534
and suspend it from that branch.

05:04.534 --> 05:05.799
It's hard work on your own.

05:05.801 --> 05:07.732
Do you think we're looking
for two people?

05:07.734 --> 05:09.834
It's a strong possibility.

05:11.868 --> 05:15.932
You know, the staged suicide
is absolute key.

05:15.934 --> 05:18.432
The killer is saying,
"Look at me.

05:18.434 --> 05:20.067
"Look what I've done."

05:35.834 --> 05:38.365
Well, since we've got sod all
to I.D. the victim,

05:38.367 --> 05:39.832
I'd better do a press appeal.

05:39.834 --> 05:41.167
Thought you'd have heard.

05:43.501 --> 05:45.765
- What's he doing here?
- Who's that?

05:45.767 --> 05:47.332
Detective Inspector Bradford.

05:47.334 --> 05:48.832
Isn't he
on compassionate leave?

05:48.834 --> 05:50.501
Not anymore.

05:53.501 --> 05:55.000
- Rob.
- Gov.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.198
You sure
you're ready for this?

06:00.200 --> 06:01.667
100%.

06:02.834 --> 06:04.899
Detective Inspector.

06:04.901 --> 06:06.131
Is it "welcome back"?

06:06.133 --> 06:07.599
It is.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.131
- When did you decide?
- Called the super yesterday.

06:10.133 --> 06:11.365
Who's this?

06:11.367 --> 06:13.765
Trainee Detective Constable
Billie Fitzgerald.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.400
- Sir.
- Pleased to meet you, Billie.

06:16.901 --> 06:19.868
Right, Sergeant,
what have we got?

06:46.567 --> 06:49.031
Oh! You nearly gave me
a heart attack.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.298
Tom's not answering his phone.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.100
Well, he'll be snoring.

07:04.634 --> 07:06.167
I don't know where he is.

07:08.067 --> 07:11.565
I think we should phone his mum
or the police.

07:11.567 --> 07:13.932
What's Tom gonna say
when he turns up?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.834
Right?
He's gonna go mad.

07:17.067 --> 07:18.532
I suppose.

07:18.534 --> 07:20.465
Hey.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.866
It's gonna be all right.

07:22.868 --> 07:25.767
I wish I had your confidence.

07:30.267 --> 07:32.065
Thanks for holding the fort.

07:32.067 --> 07:33.467
No problem.

07:36.701 --> 07:38.632
The missing persons inquiry.

07:38.634 --> 07:40.265
Have they made any progress?

07:40.267 --> 07:43.133
Not that they've told me.

07:44.334 --> 07:46.100
And you?
What do you think?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.834
Well, I'm convinced she's alive.

07:51.567 --> 07:53.367
Why wouldn't she call?

07:54.367 --> 07:57.167
I don't know. Maybe she's not
in her right mind.

07:58.467 --> 08:01.033
So you think she had
some sort of breakdown?

08:02.767 --> 08:05.031
Does that mean you...
you saw the signs

08:05.033 --> 08:06.165
before she went missing?

08:06.167 --> 08:08.501
It means
I haven't given up hope.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.365
What do you think?

08:18.367 --> 08:20.801
About the D.I.'s wife.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.133
I think she's dead.

08:43.167 --> 08:45.200
Pick up.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.267
Right, Rob.
Where are we at?

09:47.033 --> 09:48.966
The victim was covered in cuts,

09:48.968 --> 09:51.499
the fact that none of these cuts
appear to be defensive wounds,

09:51.501 --> 09:53.298
plus the redness we've seen
on his wrists

09:53.300 --> 09:55.499
indicate that he was bound
at the wrists

09:55.501 --> 09:58.000
and then slashed repeatedly
with a knife.

09:59.234 --> 10:02.098
Now, the coroner suspects
cause of death is heart attack

10:02.100 --> 10:04.400
rather than bleed-out.

10:05.033 --> 10:07.767
So, in other words,
the guy was terrified.

10:11.234 --> 10:13.799
The killer... or killers...

10:13.801 --> 10:15.832
they wanted the body
to be found.

10:15.834 --> 10:19.868
The staged suicide gives it
a kind of theatrical flourish.

10:21.934 --> 10:23.332
Killers?

10:23.334 --> 10:25.031
Well, it's highly unlikely
one person

10:25.033 --> 10:27.332
could have hauled the victim up
on their own.

10:27.334 --> 10:29.699
Right, let's just
get back to basics, shall we?

10:29.701 --> 10:31.131
Any progress on an I.D.?

10:31.133 --> 10:32.499
Not yet.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.899
All we've got is this
very distinctive tattoo.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.100
"My love will be yours always."

10:38.267 --> 10:40.234
Somebody must be missing him.

10:41.968 --> 10:44.432
<i>The body of a man in his 20s</i>

10:44.434 --> 10:46.232
<i>was found early this morning.</i>

10:46.234 --> 10:48.332
<i>He was
five feet, 10 inches tall,</i>

10:48.334 --> 10:51.532
<i>short blond hair,
and blue eyes.</i>

10:51.534 --> 10:56.098
<i>He also had a distinctive
tattoo on his left upper arm.</i>

10:56.100 --> 10:59.665
<i>If this description
means anything to you,</i>

10:59.667 --> 11:01.732
<i>you think you might know
this person,</i>

11:01.734 --> 11:04.799
<i>please contact
the police immediately.</i>

11:04.801 --> 11:07.398
Yeah, police, please.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.765
So who is he?

11:09.767 --> 11:11.899
Tom Pryce.
24 years old.

11:11.901 --> 11:15.732
Runs his own tech start-up.
Something to do with bikes.

11:15.734 --> 11:18.998
His fiancée hasn't spoken to him
since yesterday morning.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.499
He's the right height
and coloring,

11:20.501 --> 11:23.400
and he's got a tattoo
on his left upper arm.

11:24.701 --> 11:26.701
His mother's an MP.

11:28.367 --> 11:29.734
Kirsten Pryce.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.632
- Do you want me to talk to her?
- No.

11:33.634 --> 11:35.198
Go and see the girlfriend.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.632
Take Billie with you.

11:36.634 --> 11:38.365
We need to be sure
he's Kirsten Pryce's son

11:38.367 --> 11:39.765
before we talk to anyone else.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.734
Boss.

11:43.567 --> 11:44.966
If this lad's an MP's son...

11:44.968 --> 11:46.365
I know.

11:46.367 --> 11:48.067
It's a nightmare.

11:57.901 --> 12:00.465
I'm Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole,

12:00.467 --> 12:04.332
and this is Trainee Detective
Constable Billie Fitzgerald.

12:04.334 --> 12:06.532
Can I ask,
when did you last see Tom?

12:06.534 --> 12:09.465
Yesterday morning when we were
both leaving for work.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.868
Um, I'd stayed the night.

12:12.133 --> 12:13.799
You don't live here?

12:13.801 --> 12:15.599
Tom and I are engaged.

12:15.601 --> 12:17.799
I live in Chiswick
with my parents.

12:17.801 --> 12:20.398
Did you sleep here last night?

12:20.400 --> 12:23.866
No, he'd arranged to meet
a couple of old mates from uni.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.198
Do you have contact details
for Tom's mates?

12:26.200 --> 12:28.499
- Yeah, somewhere.
- Sorry, this is ridiculous.

12:28.501 --> 12:30.432
I guarantee you
Tom is just sleeping it off

12:30.434 --> 12:31.732
on someone's sofa.

12:31.734 --> 12:33.866
Does he make a habit
of staying out all night?

12:33.868 --> 12:35.067
No.

12:36.934 --> 12:39.133
When was the last time
you saw Tom?

12:40.334 --> 12:42.834
Same as Olivia.
Yesterday morning.

12:46.567 --> 12:50.165
Olivia, can you describe
Tom's tattoo to me?

12:50.167 --> 12:51.767
I can show you it.

13:09.834 --> 13:13.432
Olivia, I'm so sorry, but I need
to tell you that Tom's tattoo

13:13.434 --> 13:15.232
is identical
to a tattoo on the body

13:15.234 --> 13:17.234
that was discovered
this morning.

13:18.567 --> 13:20.098
Are you sure it's Tom?

13:20.100 --> 13:23.367
We can't be sure until
we've done forensic tests.

13:25.267 --> 13:28.065
Let's make
absolutely certain, hey?

13:28.067 --> 13:29.834
Before we do anything else.

13:39.267 --> 13:40.899
Can... Can we just
stay here for a bit,

13:40.901 --> 13:43.065
'cause, like,
Olivia's still in shock?

13:43.067 --> 13:46.000
We need you both to tell us
everything you can about Tom.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.868
It's cool.
I'm fine.

13:58.634 --> 14:00.966
What do you reckon
about the flatmate?

14:00.968 --> 14:02.699
He really didn't
want to come with us.

14:02.701 --> 14:04.501
No, he didn't.

14:13.067 --> 14:15.465
- The tattoos match.
- Right.

14:15.467 --> 14:18.131
Until I've spoken to the mother,
I need this totally locked down.

14:18.133 --> 14:19.334
Got ya.

14:40.100 --> 14:42.665
Inspector, I can't imagine
what's so urgent

14:42.667 --> 14:45.298
that you would have me
called out of committee.

14:47.834 --> 14:51.098
The body of a young man
was found early this morning.

14:51.100 --> 14:54.734
We have reason to believe
it was your son, Tom.

14:57.133 --> 14:58.799
Reason to believe?

14:58.801 --> 15:02.634
We're waiting for a DNA match
to be absolutely sure.

15:14.267 --> 15:15.966
But you're sure enough
to come here and tell me

15:15.968 --> 15:17.200
that my son is dead.

15:18.901 --> 15:20.267
Yes.

15:22.601 --> 15:24.532
How did it happen?

15:24.534 --> 15:27.465
The investigation
is at the very early stage.

15:27.467 --> 15:29.332
There are limits
to what I can discuss.

15:29.334 --> 15:32.667
What I mean, Inspector,
is did Tom take his own life?

15:34.734 --> 15:37.365
No.
No, he didn't.

15:37.367 --> 15:39.234
Why do you ask that?

15:42.300 --> 15:47.234
When Tom was 12 years old,
his father hanged himself.

15:48.501 --> 15:49.866
Tom came home from school

15:49.868 --> 15:54.467
and found his dad hanging
from a tree in the back garden.

15:55.701 --> 15:57.398
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.632
We haven't had time
to do background checks.

16:00.634 --> 16:04.234
Your son didn't kill himself.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.400
So he was murdered?

16:21.501 --> 16:24.165
Tom Pryce's father
killed himself.

16:24.167 --> 16:26.165
Tom found him
hanging from a tree

16:26.167 --> 16:28.332
in the back garden
when he was 12.

16:28.334 --> 16:30.265
So that gives us
a strong indication

16:30.267 --> 16:32.599
that the killer knew Tom,
knew his background.

16:32.601 --> 16:35.732
And that tells us what
at this precise moment?

16:35.734 --> 16:37.899
Well, it helps us a build
a profile of the person

16:37.901 --> 16:40.265
or persons
that we're looking for.

16:40.267 --> 16:43.601
Let's just stick to the nuts
and bolts, shall we?

16:45.634 --> 16:46.966
What about tracing the van?

16:46.968 --> 16:50.265
Uniform patrol reported
seeing a man driving a white van

16:50.267 --> 16:52.232
near the scene
in the early hours.

16:52.234 --> 16:53.799
He was using his phone.

16:53.801 --> 16:55.265
They signaled for him
to hang up,

16:55.267 --> 16:57.332
he complied,
so they drove away.

16:57.334 --> 16:58.699
Could be our killer.

16:58.701 --> 17:00.832
With any luck,
we'll find the van on CCTV.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.465
Tom's phone?

17:02.467 --> 17:03.832
No sign of it,

17:03.834 --> 17:06.799
but his mobile provider
are sending us over his data.

17:08.032 --> 17:09.699
Right, I'll be downstairs

17:09.701 --> 17:11.598
doing the emotional appeal
with the mother.

17:11.601 --> 17:12.866
How did she take the news?

17:12.867 --> 17:15.898
Stoic, so far.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.632
But I have a feeling
that won't last.

17:17.634 --> 17:19.499
Might take a while to sink in,

17:19.501 --> 17:21.265
the fact that somebody
deliberately staged

17:21.267 --> 17:22.965
her son's suicide.

17:22.968 --> 17:26.165
I decided to spare her
that detail. For now.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.899
Is that wise?
She's gonna find out.

17:28.901 --> 17:31.998
Let her get used to losing
her son first,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.634
before we fill her in
on the full horror.

17:36.767 --> 17:39.267
That woman has the right
to know.

17:40.367 --> 17:41.632
Tom Pryce's uni mate,

17:41.634 --> 17:44.934
Martin Tanner, hasn't heard
from him in weeks.

17:46.834 --> 17:49.365
But Tom goes out with Martin
all the time,

17:49.367 --> 17:50.899
they saw each other
last Saturday.

17:50.901 --> 17:52.968
Not according to Martin.

17:56.634 --> 18:00.100
How has Tom's state of mind
been recently?

18:01.100 --> 18:03.265
Fine.

18:03.267 --> 18:05.565
A bit stressed out
running his own company

18:05.567 --> 18:09.265
and a bit wound up
about the wedding.

18:09.267 --> 18:12.934
Kind of distant, but fine.

18:18.767 --> 18:20.767
Why would he lie to me?

18:25.033 --> 18:27.232
So, you last saw him
yesterday morning

18:27.234 --> 18:28.866
when he was leaving
for work?

18:28.868 --> 18:30.165
Yeah.

18:30.167 --> 18:33.298
I had the day off,
so I didn't go into the office.

18:33.300 --> 18:36.565
So, what did you do?

18:36.567 --> 18:39.298
Just mooched around the flat.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.398
All day?

18:41.400 --> 18:42.634
And all night.

18:44.534 --> 18:47.000
So, you work for Tom, yeah?

18:48.200 --> 18:50.232
I work... I work with Tom.

18:50.234 --> 18:52.400
The app was my idea.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.067
But it's Tom's company?

18:57.033 --> 18:59.000
He's the one
with the trust fund.

19:03.667 --> 19:06.131
If anyone has any information

19:06.133 --> 19:07.599
that could help
this investigation,

19:07.601 --> 19:11.901
please contact the incident room
as soon as possible.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.365
Tom's a bright,

19:16.367 --> 19:18.065
<i>popular lad.</i>

19:18.067 --> 19:20.565
<i>I can't imagine why anyone
would do this to him.</i>

19:20.567 --> 19:22.532
<i>As his mother,</i>

19:22.534 --> 19:26.465
<i>I'm asking that if anyone
has any information, to please,</i>

19:26.467 --> 19:29.067
please come forward.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.200
Thank you all very much.

19:37.801 --> 19:41.432
It doesn't matter who I am.
They're not telling the truth.

19:41.434 --> 19:44.100
He was hanging from a tree.

19:46.701 --> 19:48.901
Can I see him?

19:50.100 --> 19:51.565
I can arrange that

19:51.567 --> 19:53.699
through the coroner's office,
of course, but...

19:56.534 --> 20:01.033
I need to warn you that your son
has been severely disfigured.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.834
You need to think about
what your last memory will be.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.601
Sorry.

20:19.567 --> 20:21.998
Mrs. Pryce,
you're a public figure.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.434
Have you been targeted
on social media lately?

20:25.667 --> 20:28.632
No more than
any other female MP.

20:28.634 --> 20:31.998
What about in person?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.599
No, nothing I can think of.

20:34.601 --> 20:39.499
You said your son came to see
you yesterday at the office.

20:39.501 --> 20:41.732
Was it just a social call?

20:41.734 --> 20:43.866
He just turned up
out of the blue.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.499
Did he make a habit
of doing that?

20:45.501 --> 20:48.799
£700 went missing
from petty cash.

20:48.801 --> 20:50.868
And you think
your son took it?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.565
I can't be sure, but there was
something wrong with him,

20:55.567 --> 20:57.031
I know there was.

20:57.033 --> 20:59.665
Tom's been acting weird
for the last couple of months.

20:59.667 --> 21:05.000
He's gone from workaholic to
barely turning up at the office.

21:05.767 --> 21:09.365
I think he's been cheating
on Olivia.

21:09.367 --> 21:10.200
Who with?

21:11.501 --> 21:13.532
I don't know but I've heard him
lying to her

21:13.534 --> 21:17.367
about where he's going,
like, who he's seeing.

21:26.767 --> 21:28.732
But c-can I go?

21:28.734 --> 21:30.532
'Cause I've told you
everything I know,

21:30.534 --> 21:33.868
and I should really talk
to the people at work.

21:37.367 --> 21:38.832
I spoke to Tom's PA.

21:38.834 --> 21:41.098
He told her he'd sacked Jamie.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.398
- When did he tell her that?
- Yesterday morning.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.866
Interesting.

21:44.868 --> 21:47.632
You know, he is really keen
to get out of here.

21:47.634 --> 21:49.165
What do you want to do?

21:49.167 --> 21:51.434
Let's find out
what he's playing at.

21:54.834 --> 21:57.734
What a surprise.
He's come straight home.

22:01.734 --> 22:04.565
What you said, Sarge, about
the D.I.'s wife being dead...

22:04.567 --> 22:06.868
No, ignore me.
I don't know anything.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.868
That didn't take long.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.866
In a hurry, Jamie?

22:22.868 --> 22:24.532
I thought you were going
to the office.

22:24.534 --> 22:25.532
Yeah, I'm on my way there now.

22:25.534 --> 22:27.465
I'm going to
caution you, Jamie,

22:27.467 --> 22:28.966
so that I can search you.

22:28.968 --> 22:29.966
What?

22:29.968 --> 22:31.565
Jamie Bentham,
I'm arresting you

22:31.567 --> 22:33.398
on suspicion of the murder
of Tom Pryce.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.432
This is mental.

22:34.434 --> 22:36.031
You do not
have to say anything...

22:36.033 --> 22:37.267
Get after him!

23:12.934 --> 23:15.699
Right, get onto PolSA.
Let's search his flat.

23:15.701 --> 23:17.400
Come on.

23:21.300 --> 23:24.365
Tell us again
what you did last night.

23:24.367 --> 23:27.031
Uh, stayed in, watched telly.

23:27.033 --> 23:29.899
We're looking at your phone,
local CCTV.

23:29.901 --> 23:32.334
If you left the flat,
we'll find out.

23:35.634 --> 23:37.699
I went to the pub.

23:37.701 --> 23:39.432
- On your own?
- With Tom.

23:39.434 --> 23:42.300
- And?
- And we had a drink.

23:44.934 --> 23:50.131
We're gonna test the cash
and the envelope for DNA.

23:50.133 --> 23:52.100
Will we find a match to Tom?

23:53.701 --> 23:55.601
Did you steal the money
from Tom?

24:02.767 --> 24:05.065
Right, he sacked me.

24:05.067 --> 24:07.065
Told me I had to find
somewhere else to live.

24:07.067 --> 24:07.998
Why?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.265
I don't know.
Search me.

24:10.267 --> 24:12.932
Right, he's been
acting weird lately.

24:12.934 --> 24:15.432
What was he doing
with 700 quid in cash?

24:15.434 --> 24:17.031
I don't know.

24:17.033 --> 24:20.065
Right, look, we're in the pub,
he's gone to the loo.

24:20.067 --> 24:22.632
I've seen the envelope
sticking out his jacket,

24:22.634 --> 24:24.932
so I've had a look,
seen the cash,

24:24.934 --> 24:26.966
and just stuffed it
down my jeans.

24:26.968 --> 24:30.365
Like, I figured he owed me.
Like, the app was my idea.

24:30.367 --> 24:32.434
What happened next?

24:33.501 --> 24:35.232
Uh, he come back.

24:35.234 --> 24:38.432
Uh, he went crazy.

24:38.434 --> 24:41.098
Uh, started accusing me
of taking it.

24:41.100 --> 24:42.899
Which you denied?

24:42.901 --> 24:45.365
He was half-cut. He didn't know
if he was coming or going.

24:45.367 --> 24:47.866
Okay, so you're in the pub,
you had a fight.

24:47.868 --> 24:49.234
What happened next?

24:50.567 --> 24:52.732
He left.

24:52.734 --> 24:54.501
Well, do you know
where he went?

24:56.734 --> 24:58.098
No.

24:58.100 --> 24:59.534
He got in a white van...

25:01.400 --> 25:02.599
...and they drove off.

25:02.601 --> 25:04.131
Whose van?

25:04.133 --> 25:05.198
Not a clue.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.732
Have you seen him
get into it before?

25:06.734 --> 25:08.532
- No.
- What make was it?

25:08.534 --> 25:11.065
I don't know.
Transit?

25:11.067 --> 25:14.065
Okay, Jamie,
this is really important.

25:14.067 --> 25:16.065
Did you see
who was driving the van?

25:16.067 --> 25:17.801
No. Sorry.

25:23.667 --> 25:25.998
Why did Tom sack Jamie?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.031
They fell out.

25:28.033 --> 25:29.501
Over what?
Over money?

25:33.067 --> 25:36.699
The night before last,
Tom... Tom was out,

25:36.701 --> 25:41.834
and, um, I ended up
drinking with Jamie.

25:43.133 --> 25:48.932
And, um, he told me that Tom
had been seeing...

25:48.934 --> 25:50.968
seeing someone else.

25:55.434 --> 25:58.532
They'd had a party,
and I hadn't been there,

25:58.534 --> 26:02.998
and Jamie said
Tom had been in his bedroom

26:03.000 --> 26:05.534
with some slapper.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.832
When he told me,
I was... I was so hurt,

26:13.834 --> 26:17.801
so angry, so drunk...

26:21.033 --> 26:24.000
...I ended up in bed with Jamie.

26:25.467 --> 26:30.832
Tom came home and he caught us,
and he went crazy.

26:30.834 --> 26:33.499
He told Jamie
that he was sacked,

26:33.501 --> 26:35.667
and he told him
he had to move out.

26:36.868 --> 26:38.167
What happened then?

26:40.701 --> 26:42.265
I slept in the spare room,

26:42.267 --> 26:45.601
and in the morning
Tom and I had a talk.

26:47.667 --> 26:49.501
Was he still angry?

26:51.300 --> 26:53.398
No.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.801
He was sweet.

26:56.801 --> 27:00.432
He told me it was true that
he'd had a girl in his room,

27:00.434 --> 27:02.734
but he swore
they didn't sleep together.

27:05.167 --> 27:09.732
He said his head had been
all over the place

27:09.734 --> 27:12.599
and that he was gonna
sort things out

27:12.601 --> 27:15.565
and get us back on track.

27:15.567 --> 27:18.532
What did he mean by that?

27:18.534 --> 27:19.832
I wish I knew.

27:21.968 --> 27:23.665
Excuse me a second.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.365
Do you know where he is?

27:25.367 --> 27:26.832
You must know where he is.

27:26.834 --> 27:28.165
No, no.

27:28.167 --> 27:30.298
Come on, you're on duty.

27:30.300 --> 27:34.400
I need to see the
detective inspector right now!

27:36.367 --> 27:38.332
I'm Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole.

27:38.334 --> 27:40.198
Can I help?

27:40.200 --> 27:42.167
Can you explain this?

27:46.934 --> 27:48.098
Why would anyone do that?

27:48.100 --> 27:50.734
It's so cruel.
It's sick.

27:52.133 --> 27:55.332
Your son was killed
somewhere else.

27:55.334 --> 27:58.599
What we found this morning
was... was window dressing.

27:58.601 --> 28:01.601
Detective Sergeant.
A word.

28:03.968 --> 28:05.934
Just give us a moment.

28:08.033 --> 28:10.532
I told you I would
speak with Kirsten Pryce,

28:10.534 --> 28:12.799
when <i>I</i> judged
the moment was right!

28:12.801 --> 28:14.465
This is just like you,
Vivienne.

28:14.467 --> 28:16.332
You always know better
than everyone else!

28:16.334 --> 28:17.434
Sir, you've got it wrong.

28:18.567 --> 28:21.365
The sarge didn't tell Mrs. Pryce
about the fake suicide.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.734
It's on the news.
It's all over the Internet.

28:37.334 --> 28:38.934
I owe you an apology.

28:40.267 --> 28:42.467
I would never
go behind your back.

28:44.934 --> 28:46.901
You don't think
I should be here, do you?

28:48.701 --> 28:50.198
Well, since you ask, no.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.100
Not while you don't know
where your wife is.

28:55.033 --> 28:57.365
Go home.
Look after your daughter.

28:57.367 --> 28:59.632
Have you got any idea
how hard this is?

28:59.634 --> 29:02.765
Waiting, day after day,
hearing nothing?

29:02.767 --> 29:04.866
I need to be back at work.
Otherwise I'm gonna to go mad.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.432
Well, this job isn't therapy.

29:07.434 --> 29:09.467
You still have a duty
to the public.

29:12.367 --> 29:15.801
Thank you, Sergeant.
That'll be all.

29:24.634 --> 29:27.465
Well done for talking
Kirsten Pryce down off a ledge.

29:27.467 --> 29:28.567
All in a days work.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.499
Uh, any progress?

29:33.501 --> 29:36.432
Yeah, the search team
have found cocaine,

29:36.434 --> 29:37.866
some pills,
and what they think

29:37.868 --> 29:40.565
is a small amount of
crystal meth in Tom's bedroom.

29:40.567 --> 29:42.365
Well, well, well.

29:42.367 --> 29:44.599
And the forensic pathologist
found cocaine

29:44.601 --> 29:45.765
in both his nostrils.

29:45.767 --> 29:47.232
So, what do we reckon?

29:47.234 --> 29:49.298
Using and dealing?

29:49.300 --> 29:53.098
Kirsten Pryce suspects Tom stole
£700 from her office yesterday.

29:53.100 --> 29:57.765
Well, his overdraft is huge, and
his credit cards are maxed out.

29:57.767 --> 30:00.732
Jamie reckons Tom's not been
turning up for work,

30:00.734 --> 30:02.031
lying about
where he's been going.

30:02.033 --> 30:04.966
That's classic junkie behavior.

30:04.968 --> 30:06.298
According to his fiancée,

30:06.300 --> 30:07.932
Tom said he was gonna
sort everything out.

30:07.934 --> 30:11.734
So maybe he stole the cash
to pay off his drug debts.

30:13.734 --> 30:15.665
Did Tom use drugs?

30:15.667 --> 30:17.365
Of course not.

30:17.367 --> 30:19.998
We found drugs hidden in
his bedroom and clear evidence

30:20.000 --> 30:23.966
that he used them
in the hours before his death.

30:23.968 --> 30:25.565
I mean, Tom could be moody
but I never...

30:25.567 --> 30:26.998
Do you take drugs, Olivia?

30:27.000 --> 30:27.998
Absolutely not.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.765
Mm.

30:29.767 --> 30:32.532
Do you recognize this bag?

30:32.534 --> 30:33.732
No.

30:33.734 --> 30:36.968
We found it under the sofa
at Tom's flat.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.098
Are you sure it isn't yours?

30:40.100 --> 30:41.599
Totally.

30:41.601 --> 30:44.499
The bag contained
traces of a white powder,

30:44.501 --> 30:45.799
probably cocaine.

30:45.801 --> 30:47.365
We're having it tested.

30:47.367 --> 30:49.966
Well, go right ahead.

30:49.968 --> 30:52.432
I mean, like I said,
Tom and Jamie had a party.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.601
Maybe somebody
left it behind.

30:59.734 --> 31:01.665
What do you think Tom had
all that cash for?

31:01.667 --> 31:03.334
I don't know.

31:04.834 --> 31:08.398
We're pretty sure that Tom was
gonna pay off his drug debts.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.167
But he couldn't pay them,
could he?

31:11.667 --> 31:13.601
What, 'cause I took the cash?

31:17.133 --> 31:19.133
Is it my fault Tom's dead?

31:29.567 --> 31:32.799
Have you come to apologize?

31:32.801 --> 31:34.300
I was trying to spare you.

31:39.534 --> 31:42.365
I need to ask...

31:42.367 --> 31:45.400
Do you know
if your son used drugs?

31:47.400 --> 31:48.899
I had my suspicions.

31:48.901 --> 31:51.167
I even asked him,
but he... he denied it.

31:53.734 --> 31:55.599
Is that why
he stole the cash?

31:55.601 --> 31:56.866
To buy drugs?

31:56.868 --> 31:59.665
We think he was trying
to pay off his debts,

31:59.667 --> 32:01.367
get himself clean.

32:03.300 --> 32:06.899
Why didn't he just tell me
he needed the money?

32:06.901 --> 32:10.332
Because he didn't want you
to know he had a problem.

32:10.334 --> 32:14.665
Sometimes the people closest
to us are crying out for help,

32:14.667 --> 32:16.167
and we can't see it.

32:18.701 --> 32:20.265
You're...

32:20.267 --> 32:21.799
Y... It's been
bothering me all day.

32:21.801 --> 32:23.699
You're that policeman.

32:23.701 --> 32:26.300
The one whose wife is missing.

32:28.901 --> 32:33.467
So we have something in common.

32:34.534 --> 32:37.732
Sarah isn't dead.

32:37.734 --> 32:39.565
You know that for a fact?

32:39.567 --> 32:41.899
She's missing.

32:41.901 --> 32:44.534
The possibility
that we might find her...

32:45.534 --> 32:47.234
It's all I've got.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.734
I envy you that.

32:55.467 --> 32:56.799
We found the van.

32:56.801 --> 32:58.565
Finally.

32:58.567 --> 33:01.332
Yeah, CCTV near the pub
gave us an index.

33:01.334 --> 33:03.434
And AMPR have just picked it up
near Whitechapel.

33:06.534 --> 33:07.534
You coming?

33:26.267 --> 33:28.267
Get him out of there!
Quick!

33:38.501 --> 33:39.565
- Control?
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

33:39.567 --> 33:40.799
This is D.S. Cole.

33:40.801 --> 33:43.532
We need an ambulance...
urgent assistance.

33:43.534 --> 33:44.667
Unconscious male.

33:53.467 --> 33:56.701
It's a suicide note.
It says he killed Tom Pryce.

33:58.567 --> 34:01.131
Let's pray he pulls through
so we can do him for murder.

34:01.133 --> 34:03.100
Who is he?

34:05.334 --> 34:08.264
Perry Evans, ex-army,
nightclub doorman.

34:08.266 --> 34:10.431
Convicted in 2015.

34:10.434 --> 34:14.130
Served six months
for dealing Class A drugs.

34:14.132 --> 34:17.966
So Tom must have been intending
to pay Evans off.

34:17.967 --> 34:19.966
Can't imagine a guy like that
would be happy

34:19.967 --> 34:22.130
if Tom turned up empty-handed.

34:22.132 --> 34:23.400
I don't buy it.

34:25.067 --> 34:26.364
Why not?

34:26.367 --> 34:28.866
Perry Evans is a petty criminal.

34:28.868 --> 34:31.799
He's a low-level drug dealer
and hired muscle.

34:31.801 --> 34:34.232
This murder is complex.

34:34.234 --> 34:37.465
It's creative, vindictive.

34:37.467 --> 34:38.966
I mean, why would
someone like Perry Evans

34:38.967 --> 34:41.764
go to all that trouble
over a 700-quid drug debt?

34:41.766 --> 34:43.634
It doesn't compute.

35:02.067 --> 35:03.832
Any news?

35:03.834 --> 35:06.534
According to the doctors,
it's touch and go.

35:12.267 --> 35:14.131
I found Tom's number
in Perry's phone.

35:14.133 --> 35:15.832
They spoke
three times yesterday.

35:15.834 --> 35:18.098
The last time was
at 20 past 8:00 in the evening.

35:18.100 --> 35:20.599
Setting up a meet
outside the pub, presumably.

35:20.601 --> 35:22.031
But there's something else.

35:22.033 --> 35:24.532
Perry was on the phone
10 minutes before we found him,

35:24.534 --> 35:26.332
and he was calling
the same number

35:26.334 --> 35:28.932
when uniformed patrol
spotted him in the early hours.

35:28.934 --> 35:30.599
Who was he talking to?

35:30.601 --> 35:32.031
Unregistered mobile.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.367
Yeah?

35:36.968 --> 35:39.534
Great.
Yeah, I'll be right down.

35:40.634 --> 35:42.832
The girl who found the body
has finally turned up

35:42.834 --> 35:44.767
to make a statement.

35:49.968 --> 35:51.866
Will I have to go to court?

35:51.868 --> 35:53.866
I mean, what if the killer
targets me?

35:53.868 --> 35:56.365
We've got someone in custody.

35:56.367 --> 35:59.232
You've caught them already?

35:59.234 --> 36:02.298
Take it from me...
You're not in any danger.

36:02.300 --> 36:05.499
That's easy for you to say.

36:05.501 --> 36:07.968
You've got a nice safe place
to live.

36:09.767 --> 36:11.701
Where are you
gonna sleep tonight?

36:16.701 --> 36:18.265
How much do you need?

36:18.267 --> 36:19.665
No, I couldn't.

36:19.667 --> 36:20.701
What, 20 quid?

36:22.067 --> 36:23.234
Can you make it 40?

36:24.968 --> 36:27.033
Yeah.

36:29.834 --> 36:31.899
Thanks.
I-I'll pay you back.

36:31.901 --> 36:33.232
No, I will.

36:33.234 --> 36:36.701
If only 'cause it gives me
a chance to see you again.

36:40.834 --> 36:42.467
Cheers, mate. Bye.

36:44.434 --> 36:46.599
- Shift yourself.
- What's going on?

36:46.601 --> 36:47.966
They found
an overlapping cell site

36:47.968 --> 36:50.932
on Perry's phone
and Tom's phone.

36:50.934 --> 36:53.465
They were both at some
old railway arch

36:53.467 --> 36:55.799
in Clapham last night
around 10:00.

36:55.801 --> 36:58.601
- Think it's the murder site?
- I'd put money on it.

37:14.267 --> 37:16.234
Come here.
It's open.

37:41.467 --> 37:42.832
Is that blood?

37:42.834 --> 37:44.834
I reckon so.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.799
Okay, good work.

37:53.801 --> 37:55.932
Rob's found the murder scene.

37:55.934 --> 37:59.365
I-I'll stay here
in case Perry wakes up.

37:59.367 --> 38:01.000
Okay.

38:13.801 --> 38:15.868
There's blood on the floor
as well as the walls.

38:17.701 --> 38:19.868
We're pretty sure
he was tied to that chair.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.932
Any proof that Perry Evans
was here?

38:23.934 --> 38:25.332
Not yet.

38:25.334 --> 38:27.031
Right.

38:27.033 --> 38:30.565
Fingers crossed
for CCTV, then.

38:50.267 --> 38:52.334
He wants to talk to me.

38:55.901 --> 38:57.334
Hello, Perry.

38:59.067 --> 39:02.031
What you said in your note
about Tom Pryce.

39:02.033 --> 39:04.198
You said you killed him.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.767
Is it true?

39:09.334 --> 39:10.634
Is it?

39:12.067 --> 39:14.532
I was lying.

39:16.367 --> 39:18.131
SOCO have found
significant blood evidence

39:18.133 --> 39:19.432
in Perry Evans' van.

39:19.434 --> 39:21.832
It's been fast-tracked
to the lab to see if it's Tom's.

39:21.834 --> 39:23.065
If it is, then...

39:23.067 --> 39:24.799
Then we've got our man.

39:24.801 --> 39:26.033
David Bradford.

39:28.634 --> 39:31.098
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:31.100 --> 39:35.567
Yes, it is a very serious breach
of protocol.

39:36.734 --> 39:39.665
Yeah, I'll be sure to speak
to her when she gets back.

39:39.667 --> 39:41.567
Thank you for letting me know.

39:45.601 --> 39:47.732
The hospital
couldn't have been clearer...

39:47.734 --> 39:50.398
No contact with the suspect
until they gave the go-ahead.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.265
But he beckoned me in to him.

39:53.267 --> 39:56.632
I just took the opportunity
to get his dying declaration.

39:56.634 --> 39:57.832
Did you read him his rights?

39:57.834 --> 39:59.198
I didn't get time.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.398
Then anything he's said
is inadmissible.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.398
Well, it's of interest, though.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.732
We can't just exclude it
from the inquiry.

40:05.734 --> 40:08.601
Evans told me
that he did not kill Tom Pryce.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.632
Rob, can you come in and talk us
through the evidence

40:15.634 --> 40:18.067
against Perry Evans, please?

40:29.067 --> 40:32.232
We have CCTV of Perry Evans' van

40:32.234 --> 40:35.565
going to and from
the railway arch.

40:35.567 --> 40:36.932
In this still,

40:36.934 --> 40:40.332
you can see clearly
that Evans is the driver

40:40.334 --> 40:42.534
and Tom Pryce
is in the passenger seat.

40:43.567 --> 40:46.133
Being driven to his death.

40:46.734 --> 40:47.932
According to the lab,

40:47.934 --> 40:50.334
blood evidence in the van
matches Tom Pryce.

40:52.701 --> 40:54.899
Well, I'm not saying
that Evans isn't involved,

40:54.901 --> 40:56.465
but he... he's a foot soldier.

40:56.467 --> 40:57.565
He's not the ringleader.

40:57.567 --> 40:59.432
That is pure speculation.

40:59.434 --> 41:00.899
Okay, what about
the unregistered mobile

41:00.901 --> 41:02.265
he keeps calling?

41:02.267 --> 41:04.632
- Who does that belong to?
- I don't know. You tell me.

41:04.634 --> 41:07.131
And according to Rob,
Evans would have struggled

41:07.133 --> 41:09.332
to string the dead weight of
Tom Pryce's body up that tree.

41:09.334 --> 41:10.398
I said it would be hard.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.398
I didn't say
it would be impossible.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.866
Look, how come you're so certain
that Evans didn't do this?

41:15.868 --> 41:18.031
Because he told me
at the hospital.

41:18.033 --> 41:20.400
- What, under caution?
- No.

41:22.300 --> 41:24.200
Thanks, Rob.

41:38.300 --> 41:40.599
You are deliberately
undermining me.

41:40.601 --> 41:43.300
You're undermining yourself.

41:45.767 --> 41:48.165
The lab have matched
Perry Evans' DNA

41:48.167 --> 41:50.565
to the DNA found
on Tom Pryce's body.

41:50.567 --> 41:51.932
I just spoke to the hospital.

41:51.934 --> 41:53.198
The consultants have been in

41:53.200 --> 41:54.966
and said
Evans will pull through.

41:54.968 --> 41:57.000
Let's prepare a file
for the CPS.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.334
Recommend they charge
Perry Evans with murder.

42:05.501 --> 42:07.098
He's making a mistake.

42:07.100 --> 42:09.998
At the very least,
Perry Evans has an accomplice.

42:11.100 --> 42:12.432
It's a compelling theory,
Sarge,

42:12.434 --> 42:17.565
but what you don't have
is any actual evidence.

42:17.567 --> 42:19.300
D.C. Brady.

42:22.267 --> 42:25.031
Why won't the detective
inspector listen to you?

42:25.033 --> 42:27.065
This is all about his wife.

42:27.067 --> 42:29.901
You know, the truth is
he made her life a misery.

42:33.234 --> 42:34.834
I've got to show you something.

42:42.734 --> 42:44.267
What should I do?

42:46.100 --> 42:47.565
Leave it with me.

42:47.567 --> 42:49.198
I'll tell
the detective inspector

42:49.200 --> 42:50.300
when the time is right.

42:53.834 --> 42:56.100
I need to know who this man is
and why he killed Tom.

42:57.300 --> 42:59.165
His name's Perry Evans.

42:59.167 --> 43:01.899
He's 31.
Ex-army.

43:01.901 --> 43:04.298
Tom owed him money for drugs.

43:04.300 --> 43:06.899
He murdered him
over a drugs debt?

43:06.901 --> 43:07.899
That's how it's looking.

43:07.901 --> 43:10.400
Why hang Tom's body
from a tree?

43:12.701 --> 43:15.332
We haven't had a chance
to talk to Evans yet.

43:15.334 --> 43:16.899
He's in intensive care.

43:16.901 --> 43:20.131
He was attempting to kill
himself when we found him.

43:20.133 --> 43:25.067
When he's fit, he'll be tried
and punished for what he's done.

43:33.133 --> 43:35.398
Right.
We're off to the pub.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.131
Double celebration.

43:37.133 --> 43:38.432
Case closed,

43:38.434 --> 43:41.265
and the detective inspector
back where he belongs.

43:41.267 --> 43:42.332
No excuses.

43:42.334 --> 43:44.098
Yeah, I'll be over in a bit.

43:44.100 --> 43:46.868
I-I've just got something
I need to take care of.

43:51.334 --> 43:53.332
- So how was the first day?
- Eventful.

43:53.334 --> 43:54.699
The sarge is amazing.

43:54.701 --> 43:58.632
Yeah, she's a great detective,
but watch your step.

43:58.634 --> 44:03.298
The only person
Vivienne cares about is herself.

44:03.300 --> 44:04.732
<i>I know I've been critical</i>

44:04.734 --> 44:05.832
<i>of the police in the past,</i>

44:05.834 --> 44:07.532
<i>but they've done
a first-class job</i>

44:07.534 --> 44:08.932
<i>in tracking down
my son's killer.</i>

44:10.901 --> 44:13.599
I hope you're coming
for a drink.

44:13.601 --> 44:15.499
First round's on me.

44:15.501 --> 44:17.501
There's something
you need to see first.

44:21.667 --> 44:22.799
What's this?

44:22.801 --> 44:24.567
Do you recognize it?

44:26.901 --> 44:28.367
Looks vaguely familiar.

44:29.501 --> 44:32.499
It was found under the sofa
in Tom Pryce's flat.

44:32.501 --> 44:34.332
So we've got a new lead?

44:34.334 --> 44:37.801
Yeah, but not
in the Pryce case.

44:39.834 --> 44:42.832
DNA evidence taken
from inside the bag

44:42.834 --> 44:46.367
leads us to believe
that it belonged to your wife.

45:04.234 --> 45:05.632
It's Sarah's bag.

45:05.634 --> 45:09.167
The question is, how did it
end up at Tom Pryce's flat?
