WEBVTT

00:07.575 --> 00:09.177
SO HOW WAS YOUR WEEK?

00:09.277 --> 00:12.513
FINE.
HOW WAS YOURS?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.682
IT WAS OKAY.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.751
HOW ARE YOU FEELING
ABOUT YOUR DAD?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.153
- APRIL.
- WHAT?

00:19.253 --> 00:21.155
I'D RATHER TALK
ABOUT YOU.

00:21.255 --> 00:24.125
SURPRISE
SUR-FUCKING-PRISE.

00:24.225 --> 00:27.395
I'M JUST WORRIED THAT
WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEKEND

00:27.495 --> 00:30.764
MAY HAVE CHANGED
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.835
WE HAVE
NO RELATIONSHIP.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.438
( theme music playing )

00:55.923 --> 00:57.491
I'VE DUMPED PEOPLE

00:57.591 --> 00:59.993
FOR LESS THAN WHAT
YOU DID TO ME.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.530
ARE YOU THINKING
OF DUMPING ME?

01:04.565 --> 01:06.834
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.470
MAYBE YOU WANTED
TO CONVEY YOUR ANGER

01:09.570 --> 01:11.472
TOWARD ME IN PERSON.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.275
MAYBE I JUST WANTED TO GET
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL

01:14.375 --> 01:17.711
- FOR A FEW HOURS.
- DOES ANYBODY KNOW
THAT YOU'VE LEFT?

01:19.213 --> 01:21.482
YOU THINK I JUST HOPPED
A FENCE OR SOMETHING?

01:23.184 --> 01:25.753
CALL THE DOCTORS
IF YOU LIKE. YOU'RE ALL
SUCH GOOD FRIENDS NOW.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.994
I'M DOING FINE,
SO THEY LET ME OUT
FOR A FEW HOURS.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.697
I HAVE TO
CHECK BACK IN TONIGHT.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.066
I HAD TO TELL HER.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.568
( angrily ) WHY?

01:40.668 --> 01:43.371
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER
AND YOU WERE DELIRIOUS.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.139
YOU COULD'VE WAITED
UNTIL I CAME OUT OF IT.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.707
AND WHAT IF YOU NEVER
CAME OUT OF IT?

01:46.807 --> 01:48.542
THEN SOMEONE WOULD'VE
CALLED HER EVENTUALLY.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.111
YOU PUT ME DOWN
AS YOUR EMERGENCY
CONTACT NUMBER.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.247
- SO?
- SO YOU EMPOWERED ME
TO MAKE A DECISION

01:53.347 --> 01:55.583
ON YOUR BEHALF IF
ANYTHING HAPPENED TO YOU.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.752
I HAD A BAD FEVER.
IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS
IN HEART FAILURE.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.654
YOU HAD 105.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.224
THEY WERE PACKING ICE
ONTO YOU WHEN I ARRIVED.

02:03.324 --> 02:06.427
I TALKED
TO THE DOCTORS, PAUL.
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.229
REALLY?

02:09.330 --> 02:11.165
I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME,

02:11.265 --> 02:13.334
BUT I DIDN'T MAKE
THIS DECISION LIGHTLY.

02:13.434 --> 02:17.305
AND IF I HAD
TO DO IT AGAIN, I WOULD
DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.611
WOW.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.585
HAS MY INSURANCE
COVERED EVERYTHING?

02:31.685 --> 02:33.987
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.056
WELL, I'M LEAVING
AND I'M NOT COMING BACK,

02:36.156 --> 02:39.727
- SO IF I OWE YOU
ANYTHING, SPEAK NOW.
- APRIL, PLEASE DON'T GO.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.431
HOW COULD YOU?
IT WAS THE ONE THING--

02:43.531 --> 02:45.966
THE ONE THING THAT
I ASKED YOU NOT TO DO!

02:46.066 --> 02:50.037
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS RIGHT TO LET YOU
LIE THERE ALONE

02:50.137 --> 02:52.473
ON THE BRINK OF DEATH.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.210
YOU REALLY DON'T
UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?

02:56.310 --> 02:59.247
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU WERE TO ME.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.867
WHAT DID SHE SAY

03:19.967 --> 03:22.503
WHEN YOU CALLED?

03:24.872 --> 03:26.407
AT FIRST, SHE--

03:26.507 --> 03:29.209
SHE JUST--
SHE JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.913
SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE SEEING
A THERAPIST.

03:34.348 --> 03:37.050
I-- I ASKED HER TO MEET ME
AT A COFFEE SHOP

03:37.150 --> 03:39.186
SO WE COULD
DISCUSS IT IN PERSON,

03:39.287 --> 03:42.323
BUT SHE-- SHE REFUSED.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.625
SHE'S PARANOID.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.695
I OFFERED
TO GO TO HER HOUSE,
SHE HUNG UP.

03:47.795 --> 03:51.231
AND I CALLED HER BACK
AND I ASKED HER

03:51.332 --> 03:53.834
IF SHE'D MEET ME
AT THE HOSPITAL
IN AN HOUR.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.736
SHE SHOWED UP?

03:56.970 --> 03:58.772
ARE YOU SURPRISED?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.943
DID YOU MEET HER
IN MY ROOM?

04:03.043 --> 04:05.012
NO, THE LOBBY.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.115
WELL, HOW DID
YOU RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER?

04:08.215 --> 04:11.352
SHE LOOKS
JUST LIKE YOU.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.259
SO YOU JUST
WALKED UP TO HER

04:19.360 --> 04:21.462
AND SAID,
"HI, I'M PAUL WESTON.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.164
YOUR DAUGHTER HAS STAGE THREE
NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA

04:24.264 --> 04:26.334
AND SHE'S DYING
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR."

04:26.434 --> 04:28.436
I EXPLAINED TO HER
THAT YOU'D COME TO SEE ME

04:28.536 --> 04:32.139
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO
WITH THE DIAGNOSIS
OF LYMPHOMA

04:32.239 --> 04:35.476
AND THAT YOU'D BEGUN
CHEMOTHERAPY.

04:36.877 --> 04:40.348
WHAT DID SHE SAY
WHEN YOU SAID "CANCER"?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.251
SHE SEEMED...

04:44.352 --> 04:46.219
STUNNED.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.357
- DID SHE CRY?
- NO.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.893
WAS SHE ANGRY AT ME?

04:54.328 --> 04:57.398
DEFINITELY NOT, NO.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.770
SHE HATES BEING
THE LAST PERSON
TO FIND SOMETHING OUT.

05:03.871 --> 05:06.239
SHE DID HAVE
A HARD TIME BELIEVING

05:06.340 --> 05:08.409
YOU WOULD KEEP SOMETHING
LIKE THIS FROM HER.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.210
WHAT DID
YOU SAY TO THAT?

05:10.310 --> 05:13.046
I TOLD HER SHE'D
HAVE TO SPEAK TO YOU.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.552
- HOW LONG WAS
THIS CONVERSATION?
- A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.888
IT WASN'T ME
SHE WANTED TO SEE.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.491
SHE WANTED
TO SEE YOU.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.496
I WOKE UP AND SHE WAS
SITTING THERE.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.733
I THOUGHT F--

05:34.067 --> 05:35.836
I THOUGHT
FOR A MOMENT THAT

05:35.936 --> 05:38.071
I WAS AT HOME

05:38.171 --> 05:41.008
AND IT HAD ALL
BEEN A BAD DREAM,

05:41.108 --> 05:43.043
LIKE I WAS
STILL A CHILD,

05:43.143 --> 05:46.179
I WAS SICK

05:46.279 --> 05:50.418
AND MY MOM WAS
TAKING CARE OF ME.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.088
I HAD NEVER GROWN UP

05:55.188 --> 05:57.324
AND I HAD NEVER GONE
TO SCHOOL

05:57.425 --> 06:01.529
AND I HAD NEVER
GOTTEN CANCER.

06:04.532 --> 06:07.134
I CLOSED MY EYES AND...

06:08.168 --> 06:10.103
I GUESS FELL ASLEEP.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.608
WHEN I WOKE UP
SHE WAS STILL SITTING THERE,

06:15.909 --> 06:17.611
GLARING AT ME

06:17.711 --> 06:20.448
LIKE I HAD GOTTEN SICK
DELIBERATELY.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.490
YOU BROKE MY HEART.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.860
WORSE THAN KYLE.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.095
I'M SORRY.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.731
THAT WAS NEVER
MY INTENTION.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.535
KYLE TOOK ME OUT
FOR COFFEE LAST WEEK.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.871
HE'D BEEN HARASSING ME,
SO I FINALLY WENT

06:43.971 --> 06:46.740
JUST TO SHUT HIM UP,
LIKE "I'M STILL ALIVE.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.310
I'M IN CHEMO.
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE."

06:50.410 --> 06:54.414
AND HE JUST SEEMED
SO YOUNG TO ME,

06:54.515 --> 06:56.650
LIKE A BABY.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.419
AND I WAS--
I WAS THINKING

06:59.520 --> 07:02.355
"I DON'T WANT
A BOY LIKE YOU.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.893
I WANT SOMEONE
LIKE PAUL-- A MAN."

07:07.327 --> 07:09.162
WHAT WAS IT LIKE
TO SEE HIM AGAIN?

07:09.262 --> 07:11.098
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT KYLE.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.233
I BROUGHT HIM UP BEC--

07:13.333 --> 07:15.435
FUCK IT.
NEVER MIND.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.572
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A MAN.

07:21.241 --> 07:24.444
SO TODAY
I'M YOUR BETRAYER,

07:24.545 --> 07:26.446
BUT LAST WEEK YOU WERE
EQUALLY CERTAIN

07:26.547 --> 07:28.749
THAT I WAS
GENEROUS AND GOOD.

07:28.849 --> 07:32.686
CAN YOU SEE HOW
DRAMATICALLY YOUR OPINION
OF ME HAS CHANGED?

07:32.786 --> 07:37.224
- YES.
- AND CAN YOU MAKE
SENSE OF THAT FOR ME?

07:38.391 --> 07:40.193
I GUESS
I NEVER REALLY KNEW YOU.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.730
OR MAYBE
YOU'RE SO ANGRY AT ME

07:42.830 --> 07:46.066
YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME
SEEING THIS SITUATION

07:46.166 --> 07:47.367
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.837
DON'T LECTURE ME
ON EMPATHY.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.605
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT EMPATHY.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.907
I'M TALKING
ABOUT PERSPECTIVE.

07:54.007 --> 07:57.545
YOU FEEL DEEPLY FOR PEOPLE
WHOM YOU BELIEVE
ARE ON YOUR TEAM

07:57.645 --> 07:59.479
BECAUSE THEY ARE,
IN YOUR MIND,

07:59.580 --> 08:02.415
BASICALLY EXTENSIONS
OF-- OF YOURSELF.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.818
YOU FEEL THEIR PAIN
AS IF IT'S YOUR OWN PAIN,

08:04.918 --> 08:07.788
BUT YOU DO
HAVE A HARD TIME
UNDERSTANDING SOMEONE

08:07.888 --> 08:10.457
WHO'S APPROACHING FROM
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.693
YOU WERE USING
YOUR PERSPECTIVE

08:12.793 --> 08:15.495
- TO FUCK ME OVER.
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE

08:15.596 --> 08:17.264
AND YOUR MOTHER
DESERVED TO KNOW.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.633
WHY? YOU HAVE
NO ALLEGIANCE TO HER.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.702
- YOU'VE NEVER MET HER.
- AS A FATHER, MYSELF--

08:21.802 --> 08:24.037
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED--
YOU GOT SCARED.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.039
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE
MY EMERGENCY CONTACT.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.709
- APRIL, THAT--
- YOU DIDN'T WANT
THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.044
IF I HAD A PATIENT
WHO ASKED ME NOT TO
CALL HER MOTHER,

08:31.144 --> 08:34.214
- I WOULD NEVER HAVE
CALLED HER MOTHER.
- YOU DON'T HAVE CHILDREN.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.726
( exhales sharply )
IT'S SO EASY TO BETRAY YOU.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.061
IT'S SO EASY
TO LET YOU DOWN.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.430
I MAKE ONE MISTAKE--
NOT EVEN A MISTAKE--

08:50.530 --> 08:52.600
ONE DECISION
THAT YOU DON'T AGREE WITH

08:52.700 --> 08:54.267
AND THAT'S IT FOR YOU.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.170
I'M WORTHLESS
BECAUSE I'M WEAK.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.474
NOW THAT'S A QUALITY
YOU CAN'T ACCEPT IN OTHERS,

09:01.575 --> 09:04.945
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
ACCEPT IT IN YOURSELF.

09:06.513 --> 09:07.981
BUT YOU KNOW THAT
NOBODY CAN LIVE UP
TO YOUR STANDARDS,

09:08.081 --> 09:10.550
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EVEN
LIVE UP TO THEM.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.286
THIS IS LIFE, APRIL.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.388
THERE ARE DAYS
THAT ARE JUST

09:15.488 --> 09:18.458
CLASSLESS AND CRUEL,

09:18.558 --> 09:21.695
BUT IT IS THE ONLY LIFE
THAT YOU'VE GOT.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.605
LEAH LETS ME DOWN...

09:31.705 --> 09:34.041
ALL THE TIME.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.176
HOW?

09:38.078 --> 09:39.647
LITTLE THINGS.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.282
I MEAN, SHE'S A FLAKE.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.517
SHE'LL SHOW UP
AN HOUR LATE

09:44.618 --> 09:48.455
OR SHE'LL FORGET
WE MADE A PLAN AT ALL.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.590
BUT THAT DOESN'T
BOTHER YOU?

09:50.691 --> 09:53.593
- NO.
- AND WHAT'S SPECIAL

09:53.694 --> 09:55.829
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH LEAH?

09:58.699 --> 10:01.201
I KNOW SHE LOVES ME.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.340
SHE'S KNOWN ME
SINCE I WAS SIX--

10:08.441 --> 10:10.711
BEFORE I HAD DONE
ANYTHING.

10:10.811 --> 10:14.782
SO SHE LOVED YOU
WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.720
SHE GOT INSIDE
BEFORE YOU CLOSED
THE GATES.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.857
THAT'S SO DEPRESSING.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.759
IS IT?
TO HAVE ONE PERSON

10:25.859 --> 10:28.261
WHO REALLY KNOWS
WHO YOU ARE?

10:39.072 --> 10:41.041
I USED TO BE
REALLY DIFFERENT.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.211
- IN WHAT WAY?
- I WAS A TOTAL MESS--

10:44.311 --> 10:47.080
THIS REALLY EMOTIONAL KID.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.850
I WOULD CRY
AT THE DROP OF A HAT.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.721
I USED TO WRITE
MY PARENTS HATE MAIL

10:53.821 --> 10:56.023
AND LEAVE IT
ON THEIR PILLOWS
AT NIGHT.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.058
"DEAR MOM AND DAD,

10:58.158 --> 11:00.260
THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS
YOU DID TODAY

11:00.360 --> 11:01.895
THAT UPSET ME.
PLEASE RESPOND."

11:01.995 --> 11:04.998
AND DID THEY RESPOND?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.336
MY MOTHER WOULD
TELL ME THAT

11:09.436 --> 11:11.604
I HAD TO GET TOUGH.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.573
I COULDN'T LET

11:13.673 --> 11:16.109
MY EMOTIONS
SHOW ON MY FACE.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.346
YEAH.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.349
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS IN--

11:22.449 --> 11:24.284
WHEN I WAS
IN GRAD SCHOOL,

11:24.384 --> 11:26.453
I HAD A PROFESSOR

11:26.553 --> 11:29.622
WHO SAID SOMETHING
I STILL REMEMBER.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.624
HE USED TO SAY

11:31.725 --> 11:34.762
THAT FOR BETTER
OR FOR WORSE,

11:34.862 --> 11:38.298
THAT MATURITY
IN MODERN AMERICAN SOCIETY

11:38.398 --> 11:40.633
HAD BECOME SYNONYMOUS

11:40.734 --> 11:42.903
WITH A LACK
OF EMOTIONS,

11:43.003 --> 11:46.206
TO NOT FEEL ANYTHING
TOO DEEPLY.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.209
- THAT'S TRUE.
- BUT SOME PEOPLE
NATURALLY HAVE

11:49.309 --> 11:53.213
MORE HEIGHTENED
EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
THAN OTHERS.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.816
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

11:57.350 --> 12:01.688
SO YOU'VE
BEEN WORKING HARD
TO CHANGE YOUR NATURE,

12:01.789 --> 12:05.759
WHICH IS-- IT'S PROBABLY
A FUTILE ENTERPRISE.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.963
BUT THE CONTINUAL EFFORT
TO DO THAT

12:10.063 --> 12:12.565
COULD MAKE YOU
VERY ANGRY

12:12.665 --> 12:15.268
OR INSECURE.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.438
YOU THINK I'M INSECURE?

12:18.538 --> 12:20.307
DO YOU?

12:21.608 --> 12:22.943
WELL, THERE'S NO GOOD WAY

12:23.043 --> 12:24.912
FOR ME TO ANSWER
THAT QUESTION.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.780
IF I SAY NO,
I'M A NARCISSIST;

12:26.880 --> 12:28.816
AND IF I SAY YES,
I'M A LOSER.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.218
WELL, THE WAY I SEE IT:
IF YOU SAY NO,

12:31.318 --> 12:33.353
YOU'RE PERFECT;

12:33.453 --> 12:35.322
IF YOU SAY YES,

12:35.422 --> 12:37.891
IT MEANS
YOU'RE HUMAN.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.864
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOUR MOTHER TOLD YOU

12:43.964 --> 12:47.267
TO KEEP YOUR FEELINGS
TO YOURSELF?

12:48.335 --> 12:49.970
SHE WANTED TO KEEP ME
FROM GETTING HURT.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.205
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT IT HAD SOMETHING

12:52.305 --> 12:54.674
TO DO WITH DANIEL?

12:54.774 --> 12:55.976
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:56.076 --> 12:57.978
DANIEL COULDN'T CONTROL
HIS EMOTIONS

12:58.078 --> 13:00.380
AND HE BECAME--
HE BECAME VIOLENT

13:00.480 --> 13:03.083
WHEN HE WAS UPSET, YEAH?

13:03.183 --> 13:07.821
SO MAYBE
A HEIGHTENED EMOTIONAL
RESPONSE FROM YOU--

13:07.921 --> 13:09.957
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS

13:10.057 --> 13:12.625
AN APPROPRIATE REACTION
TO A GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCE--

13:12.725 --> 13:15.863
MAYBE IT REMINDED
YOUR MOTHER OF DANIEL

13:15.963 --> 13:18.465
AND IN SOME WAY
IT SCARED HER.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.036
THE WORLD IS
A MESSED UP PLACE.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.773
SHE WAS JUST
TRYING TO TEACH ME
TO PROTECT MYSELF.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.876
BUT MAYBE
SHE DIDN'T GIVE YOU TIME

13:28.976 --> 13:32.679
TO GET TO KNOW
YOURSELF FIRST,

13:32.779 --> 13:34.681
TO KNOW WHO IT IS

13:34.781 --> 13:37.117
THAT YOU ARE PROTECTING.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.054
YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW MYSELF?

13:41.154 --> 13:44.024
I THINK THAT
YOU'VE BEEN OPERATING
FOR A LONG TIME

13:44.124 --> 13:46.059
IN REACTION
TO YOUR MOTHER.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.700
AT THE HOSPITAL,
SHE WAS SO MAD

13:53.800 --> 13:55.335
SHE WOULDN'T
EVEN LOOK AT ME.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.804
SHE JUST KEPT COMING
IN AND OUT OF THE ROOM,

13:57.905 --> 13:59.706
BOSSING THE DOCTORS
AROUND. I JUST--

13:59.806 --> 14:02.675
I JUST WANTED
HER TO LEAVE.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.045
MAYBE SHE WASN'T
ACTUALLY ANGRY.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.881
MAYBE SHE WAS SCARED.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.617
- IT DOESN'T MATTER!
- IT DOESN'T?

14:10.717 --> 14:14.387
NO, PAUL,
NOT WHEN I'M HOOKED UP
TO THREE I.V.S##.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.957
THE ONLY THING THAT
MATTERS IN THAT MOMENT

14:17.057 --> 14:19.126
IS THAT MY MOTHER
IS THERE

14:19.226 --> 14:22.095
AND I CAN'T
DEAL WITH HER.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.865
MY DAD CAME BY
LATER AND...

14:27.600 --> 14:29.869
HE WAS PERFECT.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.505
I MEAN,
I WAS FREEZING,

14:32.605 --> 14:35.675
SO HE WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT ME
A DOWN BLANKET.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.877
AND NOW
WHENEVER HE COMES,

14:37.978 --> 14:41.114
HE BRINGS ME
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.418
THERE'S THIS
DARK CHOCOLATE
THAT I LOVE--

14:45.518 --> 14:48.989
IT WEIGHS A TON
AND I NEVER GET IT
FOR MYSELF.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.959
HE BROUGHT ME SOME.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.963
THEN HE SAT BY MY BED

14:56.063 --> 14:57.998
AND HELD MY HAND

14:58.098 --> 15:00.100
AND JUST SAID, "APRIL,

15:00.200 --> 15:03.636
YOU'RE A STRONG GIRL.
YOU'LL BEAT THIS."

15:05.138 --> 15:07.607
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

15:09.042 --> 15:12.012
SHE'S MY MOTHER.
WHY DOESN'T SHE KNOW THAT?

15:12.112 --> 15:15.615
HE SOUNDS
VERY CALM, YOUR DAD.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.619
HE CAN BE UNDER
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

15:19.719 --> 15:22.389
LIKE HOSPITALS?

15:23.456 --> 15:25.192
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:25.292 --> 15:27.294
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
HE DOES FOR A LIVING.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.196
IT MIGHT BE EASIER
FOR YOUR FATHER

15:29.296 --> 15:30.863
TO GIVE YOU
WHAT YOU NEED
AT THE MOMENT

15:30.964 --> 15:33.033
BECAUSE HE'S HAD
SOME PRACTICE,

15:33.133 --> 15:34.968
BUT YOUR MOTHER...

15:36.503 --> 15:39.306
- WAS OUT
OF HER ELEMENT.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.374
ARE YOU FOR THIS WOMAN
OR AGAINST HER?

15:41.474 --> 15:44.511
APRIL, EVERYTHING
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
BLACK AND WHITE.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.950
YOU ARE SO OVER ME.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.989
- SORRY?
- YOU'RE SO TIRED OF THIS.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.958
YOU JUST WANT THIS
TO BE DONE.

15:59.059 --> 16:02.229
YOU WANT
TO FIGURE ME OUT,
FIX MY HEAD,

16:02.329 --> 16:04.531
SO YOU CAN CHECK ME
OFF YOUR LEDGER.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.834
WHAT-- WHAT ABOUT
MY BEHAVIOR GAVE YOU
THAT IDEA?

16:07.934 --> 16:10.003
- YOU TURNED ON ME.
- HOW?

16:10.103 --> 16:11.971
BY CALLING MY MOTHER.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.007
OH, WE'RE BACK
TO THAT AGAIN.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.643
SO WHAT I DID STILL
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

16:16.743 --> 16:18.978
WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:19.079 --> 16:21.848
FOR FIVE SESSIONS,
ALL I'VE TALKED ABOUT

16:21.948 --> 16:23.183
IS WHY I CAN'T CALL
MY MOTHER.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.818
I WAS WALKING DOWN
FLATBUSH AVENUE

16:25.918 --> 16:28.655
BURNING WITH FEVER
WITH A NONEXISTENT
IMMUNE SYSTEM

16:28.755 --> 16:31.858
TRYING TO HAIL
A CAB TO TAKE ME
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM

16:31.958 --> 16:34.194
AND I STILL
DIDN'T CALL HER.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.829
YOU PULLED RANK
ON ME, PAUL.

16:36.929 --> 16:41.134
YOU WERE LIKE
"I'VE HUMORED THIS CHICK
FOR TOO LONG.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.436
I'M THE ADULT.
I'M GONNA CALL
THE OTHER ADULTS

16:43.536 --> 16:46.139
SO WE CAN
FIGURE OUT HOW TO--

16:46.239 --> 16:49.509
HOW TO FUCK UP
THE WORLD TOGETHER."

16:49.609 --> 16:52.712
YOU DON'T THINK
OF YOURSELF AS AN ADULT?

16:56.783 --> 16:59.018
I GUESS I AM.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.488
BUT DO YOU WANT TO BE?

17:04.491 --> 17:06.626
NOT REALLY.

17:06.726 --> 17:11.198
MAYBE THAT'S
BECAUSE YOU BARELY
HAD TIME TO BE A CHILD.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.405
YOUR WORK HERE
IS DONE.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.508
NO, OUR WORK HERE
IS ONLY BEGINNING.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.643
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.146
YOU CAN
CHECK ME OFF NOW--

17:26.246 --> 17:28.915
I'M IN CHEMO,
MY MOTHER KNOWS.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.517
WHATEVER.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.120
YOU KEEP USING
THE TERM "CHECK ME OFF."

17:33.220 --> 17:35.388
DOES THAT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU?

17:38.291 --> 17:41.594
MY MOTHER USED
TO WRITE A CHECK

17:41.694 --> 17:45.132
ON THE BACK OF MY HAND
WHENEVER I DID A GOOD DEED

17:45.232 --> 17:47.434
OR ACED A TEST
OR SOMETHING.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.303
SHE SAID I LOVED IT
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.273
BUT SOMETHING CHANGED
AS YOU GOT OLDER.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.643
I JUST--

17:56.743 --> 17:58.645
IT FELT LIKE SHE WAS

17:58.745 --> 18:01.181
YOU KNOW,
CHECKING ME OFF,

18:01.281 --> 18:05.318
LIKE "APRIL'S FINE.
SHE'S GOT A CHECK.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.587
DON'T NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT APRIL."

18:08.621 --> 18:10.690
I GOT SO TIRED
OF THOSE GODDAMN CHECKS,

18:10.790 --> 18:14.261
- I STOPPED
TELLING HER THINGS.
- LIKE WHAT?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.597
I DON'T KNOW. I--

18:17.697 --> 18:21.268
I'D RAISE MONEY
FOR AUTISM RESEARCH
BY RUNNING A 10K.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.035
BUT YOU WOULDN'T
TELL HER.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.372
NO, SHE'D FIND OUT LATER

18:25.472 --> 18:28.708
FROM A TEACHER
OR SCHOOL NEWSPAPER.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.544
CAN YOU GIVE ME
ANOTHER EXAMPLE?

18:32.812 --> 18:34.314
WHEN LEAH'S MOM
WAS DYING,

18:34.414 --> 18:37.284
LEAH COULDN'T HANDLE IT,
NEITHER COULD HER DAD,

18:37.384 --> 18:41.388
SO I WAS OVER
AT THEIR HOUSE
THREE TIMES A WEEK

18:41.488 --> 18:45.292
HELPING OUT--
JUST BUYING GROCERIES,
MAKING DINNER.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.828
BUT AGAIN
YOUR MOTHER DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.130
WELL, SHE FOUND OUT
AT THE FUNERAL.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.533
LEAH'S DAD CAME UP TO HER.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.969
IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU WANTED YOUR MOTHER
TO KNOW THESE THINGS,

18:57.069 --> 18:59.439
BUT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL HER.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.443
MAYBE.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.246
AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF SHE FOUND OUT?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.549
I WAS
HER LITTLE HERO,

19:09.649 --> 19:11.117
HER SAVING GRACE.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.853
HER PERFECT CHILD.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.389
APRIL,
IS IT POSSIBLE

19:16.489 --> 19:19.392
THAT I'VE BECOME
PART OF THAT PATTERN?

19:21.861 --> 19:24.364
- WHAT?
- YOU GOT CANCER.

19:24.464 --> 19:27.300
YOU DECIDED
TO FIGHT IT ALONE,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.369
JUST AS YOU'VE
ALWAYS DONE.

19:29.469 --> 19:32.071
YOU DIDN'T TELL YOUR MOTHER,
BUT YOU CAME TO SEE ME.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.241
YOU TOLD ME,

19:34.341 --> 19:36.709
BECAUSE MAYBE YOU KNEW
ON SOME LEVEL

19:36.809 --> 19:39.779
THAT I WOULD EVENTUALLY
TELL YOUR MOTHER...

19:41.047 --> 19:42.882
AND YOU WOULD
BECOME HER HERO...

19:42.982 --> 19:45.184
AGAIN.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.554
THAT IS SO FUCKED UP.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.456
I DON'T THINK
IT IS, APRIL.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.924
I THINK
YOU SAVED YOURSELF

19:52.024 --> 19:54.627
THE ONLY WAY
YOU KNOW HOW.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.867
I THOUGHT THE CANCER
WOULD CLEAN ME OUT

20:00.967 --> 20:02.869
OF ALL THIS BULLSHIT.

20:05.472 --> 20:07.607
I THOUGHT I WOULD
FINALLY STOP OBSESSING

20:07.707 --> 20:11.244
OVER HOW TO BE
THE BEST AT EVERYTHING

20:11.344 --> 20:15.081
AND ALL THE REASONS
I SHOULD HATE MYSELF

20:15.181 --> 20:17.016
AND EVERYONE ELSE.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.718
I THOUGHT I WOULD

20:18.818 --> 20:23.756
FINALLY START
TO THINK ABOUT
THE BIG PICTURE, BUT...

20:26.793 --> 20:29.796
IT'S JUST GOTTEN DARKER
INSIDE MY HEAD.

20:31.598 --> 20:34.667
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN ANYTHING ANYMORE.

20:37.169 --> 20:40.507
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN LOVE OR...

20:41.641 --> 20:43.676
MY MOTHER...

20:44.744 --> 20:46.613
OR MY BODY...

20:49.048 --> 20:50.717
OR YOU.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.555
BECAUSE OF ALL
THIS STUPID THERAPY,

20:55.655 --> 20:58.758
I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE
IN MYSELF ANYMORE.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.629
I LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA

21:02.729 --> 21:05.698
WHY I SHOULD GET OUT
OF BED IN THE MORNING.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.004
THAT'S NOT

21:12.104 --> 21:14.206
A BAD PLACE

21:14.307 --> 21:16.776
TO BEGIN, APRIL.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.547
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE DREAM THAT
WE TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK?

21:20.647 --> 21:23.015
THE ONE WHERE
I WAS DYING?

21:23.115 --> 21:25.251
EXCEPT THAT I THINK
THAT DREAM

21:25.352 --> 21:27.219
COULD ACTUALLY
HAVE BEEN ABOUT...

21:27.320 --> 21:29.756
REBIRTH,

21:29.856 --> 21:33.159
ABOUT SAYING GOODBYE
TO THE OLD SELF

21:33.259 --> 21:34.827
TO MAKE ROOM
FOR THE NEW.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.564
I COULD
JUST BE DYING.

21:41.734 --> 21:44.236
WHEN WILL YOU
GET THE RESULTS
OF THE BLOOD TEST?

21:44.337 --> 21:46.773
I TOLD YOU--
END OF THE WEEK.

21:46.873 --> 21:50.176
THEN YOU'LL KNOW FOR SURE
IF THE CHEMO'S WORKING?

21:50.276 --> 21:51.911
YUP.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.947
WILL YOU LET ME KNOW
THE RESULTS AS SOON
AS YOU GET THEM?

21:55.047 --> 21:58.451
- SURE.
- THANK YOU.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.825
ARE WE DONE HERE?

22:07.794 --> 22:09.962
IF YOU WANT
TO KEEP ON TALKING...

22:12.432 --> 22:14.467
NOT REALLY.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.819
C-- CAN YOU HELP ME UP?

22:34.353 --> 22:36.456
SURE.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.814
( theme music playing )
