00:06.839 --> 00:08.440
IRON MAN:
Status report.

00:08.442 --> 00:11.677
Well, we're in the future,
Thor got left behind,

00:11.679 --> 00:14.546
we destroyed our ride home,
and Hulk hurt his arm.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.816
(GROANS)
My best punching arm.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.219
And there's no way
to get home
without a portal.

00:20.221 --> 00:24.456
So if Kang's the only one
with access to the portals,
we find Kang.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.692
First, we have to find a more
secure place to regroup.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.860
Follow me.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.063
BLACK WIDOW:
What is that?

00:35.702 --> 00:38.704
I'm not sure,
but I don't think
it spotted us.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.907
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
<i>Kang. Kang. Kang.</i>
(ROARS)

00:41.909 --> 00:44.743
<i>Kang. Kang...</i>
(GRUNTING)

00:46.880 --> 00:50.682
IRON MAN: Well, now
the entire 30th century
knows we're here.

00:50.684 --> 00:54.253
I should take you out right
now for destroying my ship.

00:54.255 --> 00:57.056
But no one has given me
a challenge in ages.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.158
Then what are
you waiting for, Kang?

00:59.160 --> 01:02.261
You can still serve
a purpose.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.730
Knowing that I have
the Avengers on the run,

01:04.732 --> 01:07.599
it sets an example
for the rebels.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.735
Rebels?

01:09.737 --> 01:11.937
You needn't
concern yourself
with them.

01:11.939 --> 01:15.240
You should be concerned about
the trouble you're in.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.076
You're the one
in trouble, Kang.

01:19.946 --> 01:22.948
(GRUNTS)

01:22.950 --> 01:25.484
(GRUNTS)
What did you hit me with?

01:33.026 --> 01:35.294
(GRUNTS)
He's taken over my weapons.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.695
(GRUNTS)

01:39.032 --> 01:40.599
This is not gonna be good.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.769
(KANG LAUGHING)

01:43.771 --> 01:46.138
If you're desperate
to be destroyed,

01:46.140 --> 01:50.943
I'll have your dear friend,
Tony Stark, do it for me.

01:50.945 --> 01:52.311
(LAUGHING)

01:53.413 --> 01:54.880
Uh-oh.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.384
Guys, you might wanna run.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.464 --> 02:13.132
Kang's got control
of my armor.

02:13.134 --> 02:14.633
Get out of the way!

02:14.635 --> 02:17.269
(GRUNTING)

02:17.271 --> 02:19.171
Tony, try to give us
a little more warning.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.140
Okay. Another incoming.

02:21.941 --> 02:24.243
(GRUNTING)

02:24.245 --> 02:27.846
Sorry. My bad.
That's on me.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.215
Hawkeye, duck!
Now you tell me!

02:32.185 --> 02:34.286
Whoa!

02:34.288 --> 02:36.955
Tony, did you try
the backup defense protocols?

02:36.957 --> 02:38.157
I'm locked out.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.298
(GROWLS)

02:46.300 --> 02:48.367
(GRUNTS)

02:48.369 --> 02:50.402
Heads up!

02:51.504 --> 02:53.438
Whoa.
(GROANS)

02:54.307 --> 02:57.709
(HULK YELLING)

02:57.711 --> 02:59.478
Sorry, Hulk.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.313
FALCON:
I'll try to take out
your weapons!

03:01.315 --> 03:02.514
Don't think
it's gonna let you.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.882
(YELLS)

03:03.884 --> 03:05.117
(GRUNTS)

03:07.220 --> 03:08.854
IRON MAN:
Hulk, take cover.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.325
I'm gonna smash Kang
out of there!

03:13.327 --> 03:15.794
Falcon, try to hack into
my admin control.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.297
Reboot me.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.531
I've disabled
the operating system

03:19.533 --> 03:21.700
shock protocols.
If you can deliver

03:21.702 --> 03:24.303
a massive impact
to his neural
processing unit...

03:24.305 --> 03:25.737
Right. Like I said...

03:27.006 --> 03:28.106
Smash!

03:28.575 --> 03:30.075
(GRUNTS)

03:33.913 --> 03:35.647
(POWERS DOWN)

03:35.649 --> 03:36.982
Thanks, Hulk.

03:38.585 --> 03:40.285
Well, it looks
like that fixed it.

03:44.991 --> 03:46.325
For good.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.098
Cap!
(GRUNTS)

03:53.100 --> 03:55.334
Do you see anyone else?
Must've gotten separated.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.736
Iron Man, Falcon, Hawkeye?
(STATIC BUZZING)

03:58.538 --> 04:00.472
Look. It's Avengers Tower.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.344
If we're going to rendezvous
with the others,

04:05.346 --> 04:07.279
that seems like
as good a place as any.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.254
All clear?
For now.

04:15.256 --> 04:18.357
Although I don't like
that Kang just disappeared.

04:18.358 --> 04:21.226
Cap, Widow, Hawkeye...
(STATIC BUZZING)

04:21.228 --> 04:23.762
Anyone from the 21st century?

04:23.764 --> 04:26.131
I guess our satellites
are long gone.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.033
If I could tap
into a power grid

04:28.035 --> 04:31.103
or hack whatever
Kang's comm network is...

04:31.105 --> 04:33.872
Hey, Tony, when you told us
Avengers Tower was built

04:33.874 --> 04:35.374
to last until the end of time,

04:35.376 --> 04:36.675
I didn't actually believe you.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.480
TONY: Hmm. I remember
it being a lot bigger.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.217
If any of my tech
has survived,

04:45.219 --> 04:47.452
I might be able
to put together
another suit.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.421
Find a way
to contact
the others.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.291
Hope the others
are doing better
than we are.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.362
Iron Man? Cap? Anyone?

05:01.467 --> 05:03.368
(LOUD THUDDING)

05:07.740 --> 05:09.341
Please let that be Hulk.

05:11.344 --> 05:12.577
(PANTING)

05:16.482 --> 05:18.417
I know it sounds strange
to say this,

05:18.419 --> 05:20.519
but I get a sense
of déjà vu here.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.421
We're a thousand years
in the future.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.722
Isn't that a contradiction?

05:24.757 --> 05:26.958
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Hmm.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.495
It's lifeless, like the cities
that Hydra took over
during the war.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.698
I guess it's always
bothered me that we never
finished him off.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.599
You can't
keep reliving
the past.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.802
Gotta focus on what
you can do now.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.471
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
What we can do now
is keep moving.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.906
We're being followed.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.076
(GRUNTING)

05:47.947 --> 05:51.516
Who are you?
Did Kang send you
to find us?

05:51.518 --> 05:52.517
Nice stingers.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.653
How do you know
what they are?

05:54.655 --> 05:56.588
I think we're on
the same side.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.092
Then maybe you
can explain this.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.828
Hawkeye.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.364
We had a little
misunderstanding.

06:09.902 --> 06:13.071
It's our Avengers Tower.
But look at this.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.307
It's been made into a museum.

06:15.309 --> 06:16.842
FALCON:
Just like the one
in our time.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.543
Not quite.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.545
They even moved
my lab down here.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.655
HULK: None of this
stuff is the way
it actually happened.

06:30.657 --> 06:35.260
FALCON: Whoa. Someone really
went out of their way
to make us look bad.

06:35.262 --> 06:38.930
IRON MAN: Not to cut short
the trip down revisionist
memory lane,

06:38.932 --> 06:40.532
but we've got work to do.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.068
Hulk, look
for anything
we can use.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.404
Falcon and I will see
what we can find down here.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.908
(GRUNTS)

06:51.778 --> 06:55.947
Whoa. Future me actually went
and built the Omega armor.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.851
(BEEPS)
Maybe I can...

06:59.853 --> 07:01.286
Nice!

07:05.091 --> 07:06.658
Thank you, me.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.233
I've outdone myself this time.
And every time.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.636
FALCON:
Is that an arc reactor?

07:17.638 --> 07:19.504
IRON MAN: Something else
I haven't invented yet.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.411
It's almost like
it recognizes you.

07:26.413 --> 07:29.481
Looks like it's just
a more advanced version
of the one I have.

07:29.483 --> 07:33.151
Tempting to take it home or...
just leave it here.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.653
Learned my lesson on that one.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.254
Think we can get
some use out of it?

07:36.256 --> 07:38.490
Looks like it needs
a few adjustments.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.958
I'll work on it.

07:45.097 --> 07:46.932
Ha!
Seconds flat.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.634
A thousand years later,
and I still got it.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.243
(POWERS UP)

08:08.521 --> 08:10.655
Sometimes I'm smarter
than I look.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.126
(BEEPING)

08:15.128 --> 08:16.628
Got the computers going,

08:16.630 --> 08:18.763
found myself
a shiny new
suit of armor,

08:18.765 --> 08:20.966
and I see Hulk found
the first aid kit.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.134
But not much else.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.203
I don't like being here
without Thor.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.940
Hopefully, he's using
whatever Asgardian
portal magic tech he can

08:28.942 --> 08:30.408
to help us out from his end.

08:33.279 --> 08:34.578
Is that Mjolnir?

08:35.648 --> 08:37.616
(GRUNTS)

08:37.618 --> 08:39.851
Whoever invades
this sacred space

08:39.852 --> 08:42.120
shall prepare
to meet their end.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.592
Avengers assemble!

08:48.327 --> 08:50.362
Hey, that's our line!

08:50.364 --> 08:52.464
Identify yourselves,

08:52.466 --> 08:53.865
or suffer the consequen...

08:55.301 --> 08:57.836
Nay. It cannot be!

08:57.838 --> 08:59.671
Kind of looks like Thor.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.873
Yeah, but a lot older.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.575
I'm not sure what I'm seeing.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.877
This is Kang's trickery.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.580
(GRUNTS)

09:09.849 --> 09:11.550
Stand down.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.853
(WOMAN)
They're with us.

09:14.855 --> 09:18.323
Nice to see you guys.
You could've called.

09:18.325 --> 09:21.526
Believe me, we tried.
You're gonna wanna hear this.

09:21.528 --> 09:24.729
Remember how Kang said
he wanted to use us
as an example?

09:24.731 --> 09:28.066
Layla here is
one of the rebels
he was trying to scare.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.335
We're the last ones
standing up to Kang.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.603
Thor is our leader.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.640
LAYLA: And these are
the real Avengers.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.677
The old guy's Thor?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.848
I am an Immortal

09:43.850 --> 09:46.785
and the only Avenger
not long dead.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.588
Although the years
have taken a toll.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.390
But this is a happy occasion.

09:52.392 --> 09:56.261
It brings me renewed vigor
to see you all again.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.397
Especially
my old smashing buddy.
(LAUGHS)

09:59.399 --> 10:02.133
Ha. Take it easy
there, Grandpa.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.969
(LAUGHING)

10:04.737 --> 10:07.572
Now I lead the rebellion.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.975
But we don't know
how much longer
we can hold out.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.778
Cool. You got it going.

10:13.780 --> 10:17.649
I did some work on it,
but I could never get it
to power up for me.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.951
I noticed
some unfamiliar
handiwork.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.153
I'm impressed.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.155
You've done a great job
with your armor and weapons.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.424
Thor taught us.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.727
We've learned
about the Avengers
from this old museum.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.830
It's an incredible honor
to meet you.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.065
There's something
you should know
about the exhibits.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.500
We know.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.836
It was designed by Kang
to make the Avengers look bad.

10:37.838 --> 10:41.606
But with Thor's help,
we pieced together enough
to know the truth.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.475
Like how Falcon was
the most brilliant

10:43.477 --> 10:46.778
tech genius of his time.
(FALCON CHUCKLES)

10:46.780 --> 10:48.146
We can catch up more later.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.648
Right now,
we have to find Kang.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.016
It's not your fight.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.250
IRON MAN:
Actually, it is.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.685
If we don't stop Kang here,

10:53.687 --> 10:56.187
he'll use his time portals
to invade our world too.

10:58.692 --> 11:02.694
Ah. The rebels
and the Avengers
together.

11:02.696 --> 11:05.664
Good. I have some news.

11:05.666 --> 11:09.434
My robot army is moving
on the rebel bases
as we speak.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.502
No!

11:10.504 --> 11:12.003
Yes.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.874
And finally,
they'll put down the rebellion
once and for all.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.610
I've allowed you
to live long enough.

11:18.612 --> 11:20.912
My generosity ends now.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.822
Avengers, fan out
and take these mindless
metal-heads down.

what we've got.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.707
BLACK WIDOW:
Put more power into the flips.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.442
You'll get more control.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.812
(GRUNTING)

11:53.814 --> 11:55.080
You're right.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.184
(LAUGHS)

11:59.186 --> 12:02.520
I'll give Tony Stark
some credit.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.255
No one after him
ever developed

12:04.257 --> 12:08.393
a more efficient way to create
massive amounts of energy.

12:08.395 --> 12:12.197
With his arc reactor
and my portal generator,

12:12.199 --> 12:15.934
I'll have access
to all possible worlds,

12:15.936 --> 12:18.770
and I will rule them all.

12:18.772 --> 12:19.904

12:26.178 --> 12:28.012
Where did Kang go?

12:28.014 --> 12:30.281
Little busy here
trying not to get killed.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.619
(GRUNTING)

12:40.860 --> 12:43.194
(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

12:43.963 --> 12:45.296
Gotta find Kang.

12:49.869 --> 12:53.938
Now Earth will have
one master forever...

12:53.940 --> 12:56.808
Kang the Conqueror.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.711
I'm not going
to let that happen.
(GRUNTS)

12:59.713 --> 13:01.446
(GROANS)

13:02.982 --> 13:04.015
No!

13:05.751 --> 13:07.452
(BOTH GRUNTING)

13:14.627 --> 13:17.028
No! You won't interfere!

13:18.931 --> 13:20.365
(KANG SCREAMING)

13:26.338 --> 13:30.675
You're too late.
All worlds are already mine.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.477
It's never too late.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.579
(KANG GRUNTING)

13:35.915 --> 13:38.483
(BOTH GRUNTING)

13:40.085 --> 13:41.486
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Is that...

13:41.488 --> 13:43.621
Are we really here?

13:43.623 --> 13:44.956
You fool.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.325
The portal
is operated
by brain waves.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.161
Your simple thoughts
interfered with
my settings.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.573
(GRUNTS)

14:03.108 --> 14:04.542
Captain America!
Whoo-hoo!

14:04.544 --> 14:05.677
Yeah!

14:05.679 --> 14:07.345
You're in my world now, Kang,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.514
and this is what real war is.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.052
(YELLS)

14:18.290 --> 14:19.390
(YELLS)

14:22.328 --> 14:24.262
Any idea where Cap went?

14:27.066 --> 14:29.467
There were some
energy readings
consistent with a portal,

14:29.469 --> 14:30.969
but now it's gone.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.538
And it was the same time
Cap's signature disappeared.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.807
He could be anywhere,
or anytime.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.877
Falcon, with me.

14:41.513 --> 14:43.681
(GRUNTS)

14:43.683 --> 14:47.051
It's no use.
Kang's tech
is too powerful.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.687
No. The one who's fighting
for a cause they believe in

14:49.689 --> 14:50.989
is the most powerful.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.395
(GRUNTS)

15:03.435 --> 15:05.370
(GRUNTS)

15:05.372 --> 15:08.273
What loyalty do you have
to these men?

15:10.042 --> 15:12.010
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Duty, honor, integrity.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.211
(GRUNTING)

15:13.213 --> 15:14.946
You may rule alone,

15:14.948 --> 15:17.215
but those of us
fighting tyranny
work as a team.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.983
(RUMBLING)

15:19.952 --> 15:21.452
MAN:
Incoming!

15:22.922 --> 15:24.589
MAN 2:
Get down!

15:24.591 --> 15:27.959
KANG:
I have fought
a thousand wars.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.695
I have seen every battle
tactic there is.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.802
Lesson one...
create a distraction.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.139
This is between
you and me, Kang.

15:47.046 --> 15:49.881
(ALL GRUNT)

15:49.883 --> 15:52.116
There. That should
set things straight.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.624
(GRUNTS)

16:00.159 --> 16:03.895
(BOTH GRUNTING)

16:06.732 --> 16:08.900
You're just like Hydra.

16:08.902 --> 16:11.302
And they were just
like all the tyrants
before them.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.071
They always fall.

16:13.073 --> 16:16.007
Not the empire of Kang.
(GRUNTS)

16:23.248 --> 16:24.515
(GRUNTING)

16:30.089 --> 16:32.090
Time's up, Kang.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.092
(KANG LAUGHING)

16:34.094 --> 16:37.762
You thought yourself clever
in your primitive way,

16:37.764 --> 16:39.430
but only I understand

16:39.432 --> 16:41.532
how the portal
generator works,

16:41.534 --> 16:44.002
and how we got here.
(FALLING BOMB WHISTLING)

16:44.004 --> 16:45.670
(SCREAMS)

16:46.839 --> 16:48.272
Thanks, flyboys.
(GRUNTS)

16:51.143 --> 16:52.643
I think I've got it.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.013
You want primitive?
Coming right up.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.585
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTS)

17:02.154 --> 17:05.022
There's just us now, Kang.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.724
There's no war here,
no weapons to commandeer.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.060
What you don't understand
is that power

17:10.063 --> 17:12.696
will always find
a way to survive.

17:12.699 --> 17:16.067
It's the most basic, timeless,
human drive there is,

17:16.069 --> 17:19.203
and anyone
who doesn't crave it
is weak.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.738
There's another kind of power.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.839
The power to stand up
for what's right.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.175
To fight for people who can't
fight for themselves.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.078
(KANG LAUGHING)

17:27.079 --> 17:30.415
You're not only primitive,
but naive.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.217
You'll learn when... Hmm?
(FOOTSTEPS THUDDING)

17:34.720 --> 17:36.187
What is that?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.155
Sounds like one of the locals

17:37.157 --> 17:39.090
is coming to register
a complaint.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.093
(ROARS)

(SCREAMS)

18:10.422 --> 18:12.523
(GRUNTS)

18:12.525 --> 18:15.226
It took millions of years
for you to find a world

18:15.228 --> 18:17.528
where you could best me.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.264
So let's finish this now.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.767
You're a thousand years
more advanced than me.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.202
You've forgotten more
than I'll ever know

18:24.204 --> 18:26.104
about science
and the universe.

18:26.106 --> 18:30.241
But you never
learned morality,
empathy, humanity.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.911
Humanity is Kang's to conquer.

18:45.324 --> 18:46.224
(GRUNTS)

18:47.259 --> 18:48.826
You're not advanced, Kang.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.495
You're nothing more
than a savage.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.130
It's you who will
become a savage

18:52.132 --> 18:55.399
as soon as
I leave you
here alone.

(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

18:59.138 --> 19:00.505
(GROANS)

19:00.507 --> 19:03.241
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Only a coward thinks
violence is a solution.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.510
Hopefully someday
you'll understand that.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.481
(YELLING)

19:12.284 --> 19:15.186
Curse you, Avengers!

19:15.188 --> 19:18.456
But now, you've given me time.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.192
All the time
in the world.

19:23.762 --> 19:25.096
(YELLS)

19:25.797 --> 19:27.698
(GRUNTS)

19:27.700 --> 19:31.135
(PANTING)
The robots?

19:31.137 --> 19:33.204
IRON MAN:
Just collapsed,
depowered.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.507
Whatever you did to Kang,
his army no longer
had a leader to follow.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.776
By the way,
where is Kang?

19:38.778 --> 19:40.978
I left him somewhere
in the Jurassic period.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.314
About 150 million years ago.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.449
He's welcome to try
to take over that world,

19:45.451 --> 19:47.685
but there was an Allosaurus
who might have
different ideas.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.687
You had quite a ride.
How are you?

19:50.222 --> 19:51.556
I'm feeling good.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.191
You know, I never got
to destroy Hydra,

19:53.193 --> 19:55.526
but this seems
like the next best thing.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.329
I think this
is our ticket home.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.997
You have a lot of work
ahead of you.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.700
A whole society to rebuild.
We're up to it.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.835
Hmm. Maybe when you get time,

20:04.837 --> 20:06.704
you can fix
the museum displays.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.240
I got an image
to think about.

20:11.076 --> 20:14.011
As an Immortal, one gets used
to losing friends.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.681
But I've realized
that even after
you leave me today,

20:16.683 --> 20:18.549
you will never truly be gone.

20:19.351 --> 20:20.651
How about coming back?

20:20.653 --> 20:23.688
Yeah, and scare the pants
off our Thor.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.990
That is a tempting offer,

20:25.992 --> 20:28.392
but this is where I belong.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.394
There is much to do.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.363
And seeing
my old team together

20:32.365 --> 20:34.332
gives me hope for the future.

20:40.606 --> 20:43.374
You know, I could
hang onto this,
study it.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.276
Maybe if I...
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Tony.

20:45.278 --> 20:48.412
No, you're right.
Let's go home.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.714
What do you think's
gonna happen?

20:49.716 --> 20:51.315
Think they'll make it work?

20:54.786 --> 20:56.420
Only time will tell.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.699
THOR:
My friends!

21:08.701 --> 21:11.435
I have been searching
for a way to come
to your aid.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.271
Actually, you did.

21:13.273 --> 21:17.208
We had some help
from an old friend.

21:17.210 --> 21:19.910
And enjoy your hair
while you got it.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.712

21:21.714 --> 21:24.382
If there's one thing
I will always have,

21:24.384 --> 21:26.284
it's my perfect hair.
