00:02.040 --> 00:03.110
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:03.200 --> 00:05.237
- Caitlin!
- Dad.

00:06.120 --> 00:07.270
I'll always love you.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.676
You took our daughter
back to the future?

00:09.760 --> 00:11.160
I can't trust her.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.840
Thawne is manipulating her.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.071
Follow my instructions
and we will defeat Cicada,

00:16.200 --> 00:17.714
<i>destroy his dagger,</i>

00:17.800 --> 00:18.870
and save your father.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.758
You created
your own Speed Force?

00:20.840 --> 00:22.035
Yes, I did.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.576
<i>And I can access it
to go back in time.</i>

00:23.600 --> 00:25.637
- How could he leave me?
- Nora...

00:25.720 --> 00:27.518
How could he stop
loving me?

00:28.840 --> 00:30.991
<i>- She's gone.</i>
- Gone where?

00:31.080 --> 00:33.914
I don't know where.
I only know when: 2019.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.952
Gideon, scan servers
for blueprints

00:46.040 --> 00:48.271
from McCulloch Technologies.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.871
Gotcha.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.680
Gideon, infiltration analysis.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.036
<i>Yes, Nora West-Allen.</i>

01:08.120 --> 01:10.191
<i>The odds of accessing
this location on your own</i>

01:10.280 --> 01:11.350
<i>are 1 in 3 million.</i>

01:11.440 --> 01:14.080
<i>Shall I send a request
to Barry Allen?</i>

01:14.160 --> 01:15.640
No, Gideon.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.559
I need people
who can actually help me.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.000
Tachyon scanners set up

01:31.080 --> 01:33.117
at every half-mile interval
across the city.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.396
And the seismometer
is searching for sonic booms

01:35.480 --> 01:36.914
in the hundred-megahertz range.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.913
As for the satellites,
I've got Carrie, Charlotte,

01:40.000 --> 01:41.992
Miranda, and Samantha scanning

01:42.120 --> 01:43.776
for her yellow-purple
lightning signatures.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.871
I am clearly the Samantha
of this group, right?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.231
- Yeah, okay, Miranda.
- Ugh.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.279
So, technically,
if Nora uses the Speed Force...

01:51.360 --> 01:53.591
We'll find her.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.193
Kinda thought
she'd pop right up.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.280
If she's even here.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.440
How can you guys be so sure

02:02.520 --> 02:04.576
that she even came back
from the future in the first place?

02:04.600 --> 02:06.273
Because Thawne sent her.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.696
He showed her a new way
to time-travel,

02:07.720 --> 02:09.154
something that can't
be detected.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.197
But as soon as she starts
running again,

02:11.280 --> 02:12.456
we're gonna be able
to bring her home.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.392
Well, Team Flash,

02:14.480 --> 02:17.791
Nora West-Allen is not the only
time traveler who's absent.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.792
We've been running down
abandoned buildings,

02:19.880 --> 02:21.656
- foreclosed condos...
- Anywhere that Grace Gibbons

02:21.680 --> 02:23.176
may have hidden
her younger self, but...

02:23.200 --> 02:24.200
We got bupkis.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.316
And we have no idea why

02:25.400 --> 02:27.232
she stole the Cryo-Atomizer,

02:27.320 --> 02:30.916
except that it was worth
killing my dad for.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.435
Hey, if you need more time...

02:33.520 --> 02:35.512
Yeah, we're more than capable
of chasing

02:35.600 --> 02:38.479
a wild goose or two
on our own.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.517
Thank you, I'm fine.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.080
I'd rather be working.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.976
On that note,
I'm happy to help you

02:44.000 --> 02:45.216
follow that lead
on the atomizer.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.435
Really?

02:46.560 --> 02:49.871
- What about... Sherluck?
- Sherloque.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.096
Do you think any of you will
get this right at any point

02:52.120 --> 02:53.759
at any time in your life?
Sherloque.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.639
No, I'm going to continue
the quest for Nora West-Allen.

02:56.720 --> 03:00.839
I... feel somewhat responsible.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.559
Hmm.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.720
Hey, it's CCPD...
there was a break-in

03:05.800 --> 03:07.757
at an architecture firm
on 34th and Williamson.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.990
Meta-suspect.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.878
Citizens reporting
an explosion there.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.310
Sounds like you guys might
need an extra set of hands.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.959
I'll grab my gear.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.316
Oh.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.551
There's an alert at my dad's
old lab in the Arctic.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.438
We should check it out.

03:21.520 --> 03:22.874
Yeah, better wash
my long johns.

03:22.960 --> 03:23.960
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.236
You gonna get that or...

03:26.320 --> 03:27.360
Yeah, I'm going to get it,

03:27.400 --> 03:28.959
but I know already
it's Renee Aldler...

03:29.040 --> 03:30.360
- Adler.
- Adler.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.040
With these emoticon pictogram
things that she send me.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.238
Oh, master detective like you
can't decode a few emojis?

03:36.360 --> 03:38.591
I can decode these emojis
no problem, huh?

03:38.680 --> 03:40.911
Heart, she like me.
Kissy face, want to kiss me.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.776
Peach, eggplant,
she like fruit and vegetable.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.315
At this point
with the other RenÃ© Aldlers,

03:45.400 --> 03:47.392
we are not keeping secrets
from one another.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.550
Well, I did it.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.872
Every exercise,
every intention,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.310
and now that Kamilla and I
are hunky-dory...

03:54.400 --> 03:56.312
You have completed
the Book of Ralph.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.056
- I sure did.
- Thank you for your service,

03:58.080 --> 03:59.456
old friend,
but your job isn't done yet.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.960
Shirley, I think you
could use this.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.110
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.536
What, do you think I need
help with a breakup?

04:03.560 --> 04:04.960
Oh, come on.
Look, Addendum C...

04:05.040 --> 04:06.952
Appendix four.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.616
A guide to taking your
relationship to the next level.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.120
It worked for Cisco.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.873
Barely worked
for young Ralph Macchio.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.792
No, no, no.
This guy, he's chicken, right?

04:13.880 --> 04:15.394
Even in his
current relationship,

04:15.480 --> 04:16.696
he's too afraid
to tell this girl

04:16.720 --> 04:19.176
- that he's actually Vibe, right?
- I'm actually not afraid.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.031
I'm gonna tell her
when I'm ready,

04:21.120 --> 04:22.520
but it's just hard to navigate

04:22.600 --> 04:23.976
the meta-life,
personal-life balance.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.878
More like chicken-life
balance, hmm?

04:25.960 --> 04:27.416
Man, you're a chicken
personal-life balance.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.557
I can tell her whenever I want.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.056
Well, then tell her
right now, why don't you?

04:31.080 --> 04:32.136
You want me
to tell her right now?

04:32.160 --> 04:33.216
- Yeah.
- I'll tell her right now.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.296
I just got... well, you know.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.536
I have spotty reception
in the elevator.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.560
Come on out and do it.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.016
Well, you know,
I gotta get to work.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.880
- Come on out and do it.
- I gotta get to work.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.277
I just talked to one
of the architects here,

04:46.360 --> 04:47.953
and G. Simone & Associates
used to do

04:48.040 --> 04:49.679
all of this high-profile
design work...

04:49.760 --> 04:51.911
casinos, banks,
military bases...

04:52.000 --> 04:54.799
but apparently, last year,
they had been working

04:54.880 --> 04:56.155
with an anonymous client.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.118
So because our thief
covered his tracks,

04:58.200 --> 04:59.919
we have no idea
who that client might be.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.559
Hey.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.518
Look at this.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.239
Look at these hard drives.

05:05.320 --> 05:08.074
Fried from the inside,
like in a massive power surge.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.256
A server like this would
have a surge protector, right?

05:10.280 --> 05:12.078
A typical
metal-oxide varistor

05:12.160 --> 05:14.072
protects against
a thousand joules.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.231
How many joules does
a lightning bolt have?

05:16.320 --> 05:17.356
A billion.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.635
What, you think
this was Nora?

05:18.720 --> 05:20.074
No, this couldn't have been.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.913
I mean, our scanners
would've picked her up.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.799
Yeah, about that...
I just picked up a frak-ton

05:24.880 --> 05:26.473
of background
particle radiation.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.359
Particles?
Tachyons?

05:29.440 --> 05:30.440
Negative tachyons.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.749
That's a thing?

05:31.840 --> 05:32.910
I mean, negative tachyons

05:33.000 --> 05:34.176
can't generate
lightning, right?

05:34.200 --> 05:35.759
Unless negative tachyons

05:35.840 --> 05:38.514
don't just offset positive ones
like we thought.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.434
Maybe they actually
siphon positive tachyons.

05:41.520 --> 05:45.196
Stealing speed from the
Speed Force like a parasite?

05:45.320 --> 05:47.039
That's what Thawne
taught her how to do.

05:47.120 --> 05:50.158
She's using negative tachyons
to run and avoid our scanners.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.357
Yeah, but why would Nora
be trying to avoid us?

05:52.440 --> 05:54.591
I don't know, but if
she's stealing blueprints,

05:54.680 --> 05:57.434
this ain't gonna be
her last stop.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.040
Pretty paint job.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.635
Predators know
these colors get you stung.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.712
Yeah, it's always
a great idea

06:15.800 --> 06:17.400
for a thief to draw
attention to herself.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.393
At least I don't fly around
in a fuzzy green sweater.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.757
Didn't think I'd recognize
Weather Wizard's kid?

06:23.840 --> 06:26.799
It's Weather Witch.
I have a name, okay?

06:26.880 --> 06:27.916
Bug-Eyed Bandit.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.720
Don't call me that.
That's their name.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.235
I heard you took your
robot bee act to Star City.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.437
Something about
curing a spinal tumor?

06:36.520 --> 06:39.558
Well, I heard you and your
other half were in Bolivia.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.712
Or did Silver Ghost ditch you?

06:42.800 --> 06:44.314
Van Zandt talked a big game.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.312
She tried to recruit me too.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.754
What did she want to call us?

06:47.840 --> 06:48.840
Young...

07:07.440 --> 07:09.033
Rag Doll, right?

07:09.120 --> 07:11.271
You blew up
the Seaver Building.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.033
Bee-utiful.

07:13.160 --> 07:17.916
And whom do I thank
for my mysterious invitation?

07:18.040 --> 07:21.431
Wait, I got
an anonymous offer too.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.635
This wasn't your job?

07:23.720 --> 07:25.154
I thought this was your job.

07:25.240 --> 07:28.278
Actually, I invited you.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.955
You want us to work for you?

07:36.040 --> 07:38.794
Not for me.
With me.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.951
One big score split four ways.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.918
What's the catch,
goody two shoes?

07:43.000 --> 07:46.914
No catches, no tricks.
Just one condition.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.229
No killing.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.231
Well, this has been
really fun, guys, I'm out.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.437
If anybody dies,
the cops will be all over us.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.830
Yeah,
you would love that, huh?

07:56.920 --> 07:58.656
I'm just surprised that the Flash
isn't already here.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.114
I'm not working
with him anymore.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.520
Look, you can
put on your leather

08:01.600 --> 08:03.336
and you can act like
a bad girl all you want,

08:03.360 --> 08:05.158
but you will never
be one of us.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.118
What about the ice patch?

08:07.200 --> 08:08.236
If you don't trust me,

08:08.320 --> 08:09.520
why did you stop that test car

08:09.560 --> 08:11.472
from running me over?

08:11.560 --> 08:13.358
Is she for real?

08:13.440 --> 08:15.352
It was cold.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.440
Water freezes.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.637
Not like that, it doesn't.

08:18.720 --> 08:22.919
Look, these past few months,
I have been through a lot.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.673
I'm not the same person I was.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.956
Okay. Prove it.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.315
What's the job?

08:34.200 --> 08:35.400
McCulloch Technologies.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.272
It's the largest manufacturer

08:37.360 --> 08:39.113
of military-grade weapons
in the country.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.078
So why does a speedster
need our help

08:41.159 --> 08:42.832
to pull off a smash-and-grab?

08:42.919 --> 08:45.355
McCulloch builds and tests
all of their weapons here.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.079
The Forge.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.992
And it's protected
by a meta-human dampener

08:49.080 --> 08:50.958
that makes A.R.G.U.S.'
look like a bug zapper.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.875
So, you need us for our tech,
because it won't be affected.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.917
McCulloch's hosting
an expo tonight.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.878
That'll give us cover
to get on the property,

08:58.960 --> 09:01.759
but breaking into the Forge
is where things get tricky.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.309
There's no way this score
is worth the risk.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.960
Look. See these weapons?

09:07.040 --> 09:09.475
There's a hundred more
like these inside.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.394
Each will go for a million
on the black market, easy.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.554
We just need to make
one quick pit stop first.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.996
We need to rob the Flash.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.110
Okay, pretty safe bet
She-Cada was here.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.475
Better check it out.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.080
See if we can figure out
what she took.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.471
Yeah, that is if I can get my
fingers to start moving again.

09:33.560 --> 09:34.994
Whew.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.914
You think there's any chance
Frost could help us out

09:38.000 --> 09:40.071
with some sealant up there?

09:40.160 --> 09:42.675
I don't think
she's coming out today.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.991
She still having a tough time
with your dad's death?

09:45.080 --> 09:47.436
I mean, Frost protected me
for so long

09:47.520 --> 09:49.989
that I don't think she's ever
felt pain of her own before,

09:50.080 --> 09:51.196
not like this.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.000
Well, I-I think I could
help with that.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.638
Here.

09:57.720 --> 10:01.509
"Ralph's 27 Steps
to a Better Mourning"?

10:01.600 --> 10:02.920
I don't think
Frost would respond

10:03.000 --> 10:04.195
very well to a pamphlet.

10:04.280 --> 10:05.999
Oh, come on. Look.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.390
Uh, number 10:
go see your dentist because

10:08.480 --> 10:09.936
you should be doing that
at least twice a year

10:09.960 --> 10:11.110
and you've been slacking,

10:11.200 --> 10:12.296
and it'll give
you something to do

10:12.320 --> 10:13.879
other than dwell on the pain.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.792
There.
Now will you shut up?

10:24.160 --> 10:25.753
Told you I'd get her
to come out.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.996
Guess what?

10:28.080 --> 10:30.515
G. Simone & Associates
has spent the last year

10:30.600 --> 10:32.592
working for
McCulloch Technologies.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.796
The weapons manufacturer?

10:33.880 --> 10:34.880
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.416
They just built
a factory in Keystone.

10:36.440 --> 10:40.593
Missing blueprints.
Top-secret facility.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.957
I think we might have
a heist on our hands.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.656
You think Nora's
going after these weapons?

10:45.680 --> 10:47.536
No, maybe she's just trying
to get them off the market.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.472
You know, like the time
that Barry and Ralph

10:49.560 --> 10:50.776
were gonna buy
the Toastmasters.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.679
No, she's on a mission
for Thawne.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.513
He doesn't think that small.

10:56.200 --> 10:59.637
Hey, Barry is scanning
for negative tachyons.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.989
Why don't you and I dig

11:01.080 --> 11:02.992
into what kind of weapons
McCulloch is making?

11:03.080 --> 11:05.231
I know this whistleblower
down at the DOD.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.456
Maybe she could offer
some insight.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.994
Uh...

11:09.240 --> 11:12.870
Iris, are you sure
there isn't anything else

11:12.960 --> 11:14.280
you'd like to talk about?

11:17.960 --> 11:21.590
Look...
when I saw Nora in 2049,

11:21.680 --> 11:24.593
she was so upset and so angry,

11:24.680 --> 11:28.037
but she knew
that I wanted to bring her back.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.600
Then she comes back
to this time

11:29.680 --> 11:31.160
and... and she doesn't even
come home?

11:31.200 --> 11:32.714
I mean, even if
she's mad at Barry

11:32.800 --> 11:36.396
or she wanted
some kind of sci-fi weapon...

11:36.480 --> 11:39.040
Then why didn't she just come
to the rest of us for help?

11:41.720 --> 11:43.871
There's gotta be
a good reason.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.797
I know it.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.680
Come on, Nora.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.470
She's avoiding us.
She's stealing blueprints.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.870
I mean, she could really
get into trouble out there.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.316
But do you think she'll return
if you do find her?

11:59.400 --> 12:01.710
After all, she has good reason
to be angry at all of us.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.156
All... what?
Don't lump me in with you two.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.640
I was pissed.
She was pissed.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.758
But we've both had time
to... get over it,

12:08.840 --> 12:10.160
and she's still Nora.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.879
If I tell her
she can come home again,

12:12.000 --> 12:13.719
I'm sure she'll stop
working with Thawne.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.030
Is that Nora?

12:17.120 --> 12:18.190
It has to be.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.794
She's in the Starchives.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.632
Nora.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.635
Hi, Dad.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.552
Hey, where you going?

12:40.640 --> 12:42.154
Nora is my responsibility
as well.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.511
I must speak with her.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.954
Hey, hold that!

12:49.480 --> 12:50.800
One of our motion sensors

12:50.880 --> 12:53.111
just got tripped
in the sewage system.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.554
Sewage system?

12:54.640 --> 12:56.154
<i>Mais non.</i>
Nobody could fit down there.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.230
Is that
Spencer Young's phone?

13:09.320 --> 13:11.039
What are you doing?

13:12.800 --> 13:15.679
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.433
Nora...

13:18.840 --> 13:23.471
I shouldn't have left things
the way that I did.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.960
All right?

13:26.520 --> 13:28.955
I want you to come home.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.313
We all do.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.357
You just have to stop
working with Thawne.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.393
<i>Target acquired.</i>

13:38.480 --> 13:40.392
Copy that.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.517
Are you talking to someone?

13:45.600 --> 13:48.434
What do you think,
I'm talking to Thawne?

13:48.520 --> 13:50.751
He's in the future, Dad.
I can't exactly call him up.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.194
I didn't say that.

13:52.280 --> 13:53.616
Yeah, but you did say
that I couldn't come home

13:53.640 --> 13:55.199
if I was still working
with him.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.634
- You still don't trust me.
- Nora, trust takes time.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.791
Then what's to stop you
from sending me back

14:00.880 --> 14:03.031
the next time
you get pissed at me?

14:03.120 --> 14:04.395
Nothing.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.791
Because you've given up
on me again.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.837
Given up on me
like you do

14:09.920 --> 14:12.276
every time!

14:12.360 --> 14:13.589
Nora, what are you doing?

14:13.680 --> 14:16.878
You know, I came back here
to meet you.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.754
And the second I got here,
you started pushing me away.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.196
And then you left me
in the future.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.237
You just dumped me
in the middle of the street

14:24.320 --> 14:25.549
and walked away!

14:25.640 --> 14:26.835
You have to stop.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.720
And you didn't come with Mom
to bring me back.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.510
Because you don't want me here.
You don't want me at all!

14:32.640 --> 14:33.994
- Nora, please!
- I hate you!

14:46.760 --> 14:48.114
Nora broke into
the Starchives.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.357
I'm sorry, what happened?

14:50.440 --> 14:52.796
Nora broke into
the Starchives.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.997
I thought I could stop her,
but I couldn't.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.296
She stole
Spencer Young's phone.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.198
Spencer Young's
hypnotizing phone?

14:58.280 --> 15:00.033
- Yes.
- Barry, it's okay.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.800
Did you at least find out
what she's doing?

15:01.920 --> 15:03.400
No, no. I tried.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.995
I-I thought I could convince
her to come home.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.400
But...

15:07.480 --> 15:10.075
her face started vibrating,
and...

15:10.160 --> 15:12.436
and then her eyes, and...

15:12.520 --> 15:14.876
her lightning...

15:14.960 --> 15:16.952
it was red.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.633
Just like his.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.279
I thought we had time
to reach her,

15:20.360 --> 15:21.360
but he got to her.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.914
Thawne really got to her.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.480
Uh, guys,

15:24.560 --> 15:27.632
there's a blinky red light
thing on the computer.

15:27.720 --> 15:31.316
Another alarm went off
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.232
Guys, this was only
five minutes ago.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.198
Joss Jackam and Peter Merkel?

15:35.280 --> 15:36.656
How would they get
into S.T.A.R. Labs?

15:36.680 --> 15:38.592
Nora had someone in her ear.

15:38.680 --> 15:41.593
It was a coordinated assault.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.320
But that would mean
that she's working...

15:44.400 --> 15:45.470
with them.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.040
Barium.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.349
We're in Keystone City.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.399
Well, we got a Rag Doll,

15:58.480 --> 16:01.234
a Weather Witch, and, uh...

16:01.320 --> 16:03.960
hold up, is that
crazy bee girl?

16:04.040 --> 16:05.793
Hey, girl!
What's going on?

16:06.440 --> 16:08.397
What a throwback.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.709
What the hell
is he doing here?

16:09.800 --> 16:12.076
What the hell
are you doing here?

16:12.160 --> 16:13.799
Oh, no.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.394
She's with them.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.711
I said I wanted Ramon.
No one else.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.075
Yeah, well,
they were together,

16:19.160 --> 16:21.311
and you said no killing,
so here they are.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.880
Killing?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.231
This phone was synced
to Spencer Young's DNA.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.680
We need you to hack past the
coding so we're able to use it.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.230
Why are you laughing?

16:30.320 --> 16:31.993
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to blow up

16:32.080 --> 16:33.912
your spot, fangirl,
you see, it's just, um...

16:34.000 --> 16:37.118
I've done this exact
same thing before.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.876
We need to hack a weapon.
Let's kidnap Cisco.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.475
I mean, what, did you join a
Rogues cover band or something?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.678
How's this for a cover band?

16:56.040 --> 16:58.271
Oldie but a goodie.

16:58.360 --> 17:02.559
Look, XS,
I owe you an apology, hmm?

17:02.640 --> 17:04.790
Never should've exposed
your secret the way I did.

17:04.880 --> 17:07.873
I put my pride in front
of the family that took me in...

17:07.960 --> 17:11.271
your family...
and your family loves you.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.510
I'm sure you heard.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.512
Your father told you
as much today, right?

17:14.599 --> 17:16.272
You saw your father?

17:16.359 --> 17:18.920
You said you were robbing
the Flash.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.753
- No.
- No, don't you get it?

17:21.839 --> 17:23.832
Her old man is the Flash.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.834
Look, you don't have to worry
about the Flash, okay?

17:28.920 --> 17:31.913
Just get Ramon started
on that phone.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.754
Hey.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.036
Boot scuff marks.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.674
I'm thinking
she hit this thing.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.479
Yeah.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.991
Intravenous electrolytes.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.231
I mean, those can be used
to treat coma patients.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.915
So maybe she grabbed them
for Grace Junior.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.354
Hell yeah.

17:53.440 --> 17:57.150
I knew your <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>
thing would come in handy.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.880
Ralph, why did you
really bring me here?

17:59.960 --> 18:02.714
Was it to help
Killer Frost and me?

18:02.800 --> 18:05.315
The same way you helped
Cisco get over Gypsy

18:05.400 --> 18:08.472
and Sherloque with Renee?

18:08.560 --> 18:11.029
What are you talking about?
I mean, we're a team.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.376
It's what we do.
We help each other.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.336
Yeah, but the minute you
got the Book of Ralph back

18:14.360 --> 18:17.353
from Cisco, you tried
to give it away again.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.715
Don't you want to use it?

18:18.800 --> 18:21.156
Try and find someone
special for yourself?

18:23.440 --> 18:25.432
Caitlin...

18:25.520 --> 18:27.079
look...

18:27.160 --> 18:29.311
Book of Ralph...

18:29.400 --> 18:31.790
works great
for other people, but...

18:32.960 --> 18:35.316
never actually worked for me.

18:36.560 --> 18:40.031
I know I'm not...

18:40.120 --> 18:42.271
built for love.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.673
And that's okay.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.871
Ralph Dibny, you are kind,
intelligent, and compassionate.

18:53.960 --> 18:54.996
And most of all,

18:55.080 --> 18:58.278
you put the needs
of others before yourself.

18:58.360 --> 19:02.036
So that means
you are built for love,

19:02.160 --> 19:04.834
and you deserve someone
who loves you back.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.111
Caitlin...

19:15.160 --> 19:17.277
I'm sorry, I just don't
feel that way about you.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.636
Ugh. Gross!

19:19.760 --> 19:21.433
Oh, come on, you idiot.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.160
Sorry, I got my...
I got my wires crossed.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.197
Jeez.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.556
Hey...

19:28.400 --> 19:30.960
I think this might be
the fridge

19:31.040 --> 19:32.554
that Cisco was
telling me about,

19:32.640 --> 19:35.200
the one that he rewired
as an incubator.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.518
And now the top shelf is empty.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.512
Okay, what was on
the top shelf?

19:40.600 --> 19:44.276
Cisco's prototypes
for the meta-human cure.

19:46.120 --> 19:50.034
I think I know
what Cicada is planning.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.998
Last time a group of women

19:52.080 --> 19:53.434
had me tied up like this...

19:53.520 --> 19:55.273
They were your ex-wives?

19:55.360 --> 19:56.874
No, their attorneys,
actually.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.191
Am I gonna end up like you?

19:59.280 --> 20:00.634
Married to the job?

20:00.760 --> 20:02.433
Keeping secrets
from everyone I know?

20:02.520 --> 20:04.352
Well, actually,
in my current romance,

20:04.440 --> 20:05.999
I'm not the one
keeping secrets.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.958
No, no,
I meet Renee Aldler...

20:08.040 --> 20:11.033
- Adler...
- And then I discover...

20:11.120 --> 20:13.077
she's a meta-human.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.349
And she hasn't told you yet?

20:16.440 --> 20:18.113
No, monsieur.
Can you believe that?

20:18.200 --> 20:20.999
So if you know the truth,
and you're bottling it in,

20:21.080 --> 20:24.676
doesn't that mean you're
kind of being dishonest?

20:27.280 --> 20:28.999
Chicken recognize chicken.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.315
Hmm.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.153
And yet, are you
really a chicken...

20:32.240 --> 20:33.833
Monsieur Bawk?

20:33.960 --> 20:37.158
Or are you not sharing your
secret identity with Kamala...

20:37.240 --> 20:38.993
- Kamilla.
- Because...

20:39.080 --> 20:42.835
you're not super-satisfied
with your secret identity?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.117
Are you saying
I don't want to be Vibe?

20:47.200 --> 20:50.079
Well, let's examine
the evidence, shall we?

20:50.160 --> 20:53.073
You spent this past year
sans powers for the first part,

20:53.160 --> 20:55.675
and the second part
curing powers.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.513
Perhaps being honest
with Kamala...

20:57.600 --> 20:58.829
Kamilla.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.416
Begins with being honest
with yourself.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.999
Think about that.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.911
So what we know is that
Nora put together a team

21:08.000 --> 21:11.676
to break into here,
McCulloch Technologies,

21:11.760 --> 21:13.114
a weapons manufacturer.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.476
But not just any weapons.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.360
The city has contracted
these guys to clean up

21:17.440 --> 21:19.240
the shrapnel from
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.456
Let me guess:
None of that crap

21:20.480 --> 21:22.073
ended up in the dump.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.994
They used it to make meta-tech
like Spencer Young's phone.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.436
My source says
that McCulloch is debuting

21:27.520 --> 21:30.194
a new line of products tonight.

21:30.280 --> 21:33.352
That's a perfect cover-up
for a break-in.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.159
We have any theory
on Nora's motive?

21:35.240 --> 21:37.994
Actually, Cicada's dagger
dampens the abilities

21:38.080 --> 21:39.639
of meta-humans nearby,

21:39.720 --> 21:41.951
but it wouldn't have
any effect on meta-tech.

21:42.040 --> 21:45.397
So maybe Nora wants
to catch Cicada?

21:45.480 --> 21:47.437
Or do something worse.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.955
Barry, there's no way.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.555
This is exactly
what I was afraid of, Iris.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.233
Thawne's been manipulating her.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.710
Now she's acting like him,
talking like him.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.996
That doesn't mean that she's
capable of killing Cicada.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.480
She's working with Rogues.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.119
She kidnapped Cisco
and Sherloque.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.396
We don't know
what she's capable of.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.472
So what do you want
to do, Barr?

22:06.560 --> 22:07.710
We bring her in.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.120
We use Cisco's force fields,

22:09.200 --> 22:11.078
Ray's nanites...
we're bringing her in,

22:11.160 --> 22:13.470
before she steps
anywhere near that building.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.876
Hey, Barry.
Hold on.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.360
Hey.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.358
We can't keep treating Nora

22:19.480 --> 22:21.096
like she's some kind
of super-villain, okay?

22:21.120 --> 22:23.296
- We're just gonna push her away.
- What are we supposed to do?

22:23.320 --> 22:24.776
Just let her keep
taking advantage of us?

22:24.800 --> 22:27.031
No.
We see where she's coming from.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.696
We try to figure out
why she's doing this.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.473
It doesn't matter why, Iris!

22:30.560 --> 22:31.960
This is Thawne.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.235
It's his plan.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.834
Well, maybe his plan
isn't so bad.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.029
What?

22:40.800 --> 22:41.995
Maybe...

22:42.080 --> 22:43.150
I thought...

22:43.240 --> 22:45.914
I thought we were
past this, it's...

22:46.000 --> 22:50.040
it's not okay for her
to work with Thawne.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.237
You saw him.
You said he's manipulating her.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.680
And I said
that he cares about her.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.000
He's worried about her safety...

22:55.080 --> 22:57.276
No, he needs her, Iris.
He needs her.

22:57.360 --> 23:00.751
Or... he's changed.

23:00.840 --> 23:04.390
Barry, Thawne is the one that
convinced me to come back home

23:04.480 --> 23:06.472
and try and patch
things up with you.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.639
Thawne.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.954
Thawne gave you advice?

23:13.800 --> 23:16.474
Look, I know
it sounds insane,

23:16.560 --> 23:19.712
and I know this must be
hard for you to hear,

23:19.800 --> 23:21.678
but, Barry,
ever since I got back home,

23:21.760 --> 23:25.197
the same question
keeps running through my mind.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.397
What if Nora is right?

23:27.480 --> 23:29.995
What if Thawne really is
trying to redeem himself

23:30.080 --> 23:31.560
and that he does want
to stop Cicada

23:31.680 --> 23:33.680
and the only reason
that Nora hasn't come back home

23:33.720 --> 23:36.679
is because she knows
that you don't trust her?

23:38.200 --> 23:39.520
Look...

23:39.600 --> 23:42.195
Barry, having Nora in our lives

23:42.280 --> 23:44.840
has made us better people.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.957
Isn't it possible

23:47.040 --> 23:49.271
that she did the same thing
to Thawne?

24:05.760 --> 24:07.877
Jenni Ognats?

24:07.960 --> 24:09.997
I thought the idea
was to not draw attention.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.536
Oh, what, so now that you
know my dad's the Flash,

24:11.560 --> 24:12.789
you don't trust me?

24:12.880 --> 24:14.872
Hey, you're the one
who doesn't trust us.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.633
Isn't that right...

24:16.720 --> 24:18.439
Nora?

24:18.560 --> 24:22.998
Yeah, your secret identity,
it's really not worth much.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.151
Feels like nothing about me
is worth much lately.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.755
My dad left me,

24:39.840 --> 24:44.039
after everything that I've done
to try and help him.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.796
You know what the most
embarrassing part is?

24:46.920 --> 24:49.389
There's this tiny, little,
weak part of me

24:49.480 --> 24:51.790
that still wants him
to walk through that door

24:51.880 --> 24:53.030
and take me home.

24:59.920 --> 25:04.551
My dad left my mom
at the maternity ward.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.913
She couldn't look at me
without seeing him.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.151
She made sure I knew it too.

25:11.240 --> 25:14.278
So the day I turned 13, I ran.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.874
I didn't leave town at first.

25:15.960 --> 25:19.271
I stayed under the overpass
with all the other runaways.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.319
And I thought for sure,

25:22.400 --> 25:24.312
one night, I'd look up

25:25.240 --> 25:26.754
and I'd see my mom.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.154
She never showed.

25:30.680 --> 25:33.070
- Sorry.
- I'm not.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.958
When people tell you that

25:35.040 --> 25:37.919
family is always
gonna be there for you,

25:38.000 --> 25:39.229
they're full of it.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.593
Mentors will always
let you down eventually.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.956
Parents will break you.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.633
Yeah.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.996
That's why we
have to stick together.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.193
- Yeah.
<i>- Hey, it's done.</i>

25:53.320 --> 25:55.357
Come on.
Nerd's done with the phone.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.913
One reprogrammed
meta-tech phone,

26:03.000 --> 26:06.471
now with visual and auditory
hypnosis capabilities.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.112
Plus unlimited data.

26:13.680 --> 26:14.796
You gonna let us go now?

26:14.880 --> 26:16.758
What, so you can run
right back to the Flash?

26:16.840 --> 26:19.753
How stupid do you think I am?

26:19.840 --> 26:21.035
Any bugs in there?

26:21.120 --> 26:22.952
- It's clean.
- Good.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.600
Now make sure
they can't try anything else.

26:36.520 --> 26:37.749
Come on.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.911
This score's not
gonna steal itself.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.936
<i>You're not gonna
get away with this.</i>

26:50.960 --> 26:52.189
Hey.

26:52.280 --> 26:53.376
<i>I'm not gonna get away
with it?</i>

26:53.400 --> 26:55.392
Cisco's old speedster trap.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.358
You think that's gonna
work for Nora?

26:57.440 --> 26:58.920
I don't know.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.357
I'm not sure I'm ready
to find out, though.

27:02.440 --> 27:05.194
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about, um...

27:05.280 --> 27:08.512
how I was acting earlier,
I just...

27:08.600 --> 27:10.796
seeing Nora
looking so much like him...

27:10.880 --> 27:13.031
No, I get it, Barr.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.998
That guy's always
gonna be in your head.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.719
Mine too.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.553
And you were right.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.359
Nora broke the law.

27:20.440 --> 27:22.716
And there should be
repercussions for that.

27:23.320 --> 27:27.360
But whenever you guys
step out of bounds,

27:27.440 --> 27:29.557
I always have to
remind myself,

27:29.640 --> 27:32.109
the detective side says
there's the law.

27:33.080 --> 27:37.233
But the father side says
there's also what's right.

27:37.320 --> 27:43.032
And... I'm always gonna choose
to be your father first.

27:46.720 --> 27:47.790
Maybe that's my problem.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.234
What?

27:51.880 --> 27:54.998
I was ready
to give up on her.

27:55.080 --> 27:58.232
You know? I mean,
If I'm ready to do that,

27:58.360 --> 27:59.999
it makes me feel like

28:00.080 --> 28:02.390
even after everything
we've been through,

28:02.480 --> 28:04.233
I'm not a good parent.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.856
You know, I mean,
maybe I never will be.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.520
Come on, Barry.
You know that's not true.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.638
You're going to be
an amazing father.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.235
I wanted her to leave.

28:14.320 --> 28:18.314
The second that she got here,
I did, I...

28:18.400 --> 28:20.471
I've held back from her.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.473
It still doesn't feel right
when she calls me Dad.

28:23.560 --> 28:27.713
Well, you didn't
call me Dad till...

28:27.800 --> 28:29.678
it was here, in this room,

28:29.760 --> 28:32.229
right after you got
your powers.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.312
But you know why that was.

28:34.440 --> 28:38.150
You already had a dad.
Henry.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.616
And when the whole world
thought that

28:39.640 --> 28:42.792
that man was a criminal,
Barr, you...

28:45.640 --> 28:47.359
You thought he was perfect.

28:49.600 --> 28:50.954
Do you think Iris is right?

28:52.320 --> 28:56.519
Nora's plan, Thawne's plan...

28:56.600 --> 28:58.080
could be a good thing?

28:58.160 --> 28:59.833
I don't trust that man.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.238
I never have and I never will.

29:02.880 --> 29:05.349
But I do...

29:05.440 --> 29:08.114
trust my granddaughter.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.317
And if we're gonna
bring Nora home, Barr...

29:11.760 --> 29:14.320
you're gonna have
to trust her too.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.280
Oh, thank Crom.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.317
I might've given you
unlimited data,

29:28.400 --> 29:30.278
but I also gave you
spotty reception.

29:30.360 --> 29:31.714
Nice work.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.216
All right.
The bees are in drone mode.

29:33.240 --> 29:36.278
So if we move very,
very slowly...

29:36.360 --> 29:38.033
Man, what in the world?

29:38.120 --> 29:39.236
What?

29:39.320 --> 29:40.720
I was trained
in the art of escape

29:40.840 --> 29:42.320
by Thaddeus Brown
from Earth-51.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.993
Yeah, well, help me escape!

29:44.080 --> 29:45.958
That's a good plan.
All right.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.440
So, um...

29:47.520 --> 29:49.318
- Count backwards from ten.
- Ten...

29:49.400 --> 29:50.400
Ow!

29:50.480 --> 29:51.755
How did you do that?

29:51.840 --> 29:52.910
- Trade secret.
- Okay.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.954
So...

29:56.040 --> 29:57.840
You're not fireproof,
are you, Monsieur Ramon?

29:57.920 --> 29:59.513
Am I fire...
oh, God.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.910
Oh.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.593
Ah.

30:04.680 --> 30:05.680
No, no.

30:05.681 --> 30:06.955
Hey!

30:16.400 --> 30:17.436
That's all of them?

30:17.520 --> 30:19.000
- I think so.
- Good.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.799
Because Nora West-Allen
is in grave danger.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.216
Thank you for your patience,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:34.240 --> 30:37.039
With the kind of technology
we're displaying tonight,

30:37.120 --> 30:39.919
security is our
highest priority.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.116
Visitor IDs, please.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.793
You bet.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.557
Okay, here we go.
Right this way, ladies.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.074
The last ten months have been

30:54.160 --> 30:55.958
very exciting
here at McCulloch.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.993
Buyers from the Army and Navy
are already waiting for us

30:59.080 --> 31:00.639
in our state-of-the-art
demo room.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.632
Uh, what's behind that door?

31:03.520 --> 31:05.000
Ah.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.960
That's what our engineers
have dubbed the Forge.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.560
It's where we develop and test
our new weapons.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.200
Unfortunately, it's only
accessible to employees

31:12.280 --> 31:15.000
with the highest
security clearance.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.714
Remember.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.120
No killing.

31:30.280 --> 31:33.034
That's a Montgomery 4000,
30-ton vault door.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.879
It'll only open
from the inside,

31:34.960 --> 31:38.158
so the only way into the Forge
is through there.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.755
Mm, cozy.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.638
Ready, clown?

32:10.080 --> 32:12.436
Are you sure you can fit
through that thing?

32:14.280 --> 32:20.072
This shall be my aria.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.616
Remember, once you get
to the other side,

32:21.640 --> 32:23.518
the dampener will take away
your powers,

32:23.600 --> 32:25.956
so get out quick.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.350
Yeah, I'm gonna vomit.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.159
Mm, mm, mm...

32:47.880 --> 32:49.997
Open sesame.

32:53.280 --> 32:57.559
Stay with the hostages.
We'll grab you on the way out.

32:57.640 --> 33:00.394
See you soon.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.320
That's one serious
meta-dampener.

33:13.040 --> 33:14.793
Whoa.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.993
Last part of the plan.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.914
Load up.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.435
Sorry, XS.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.159
Change of plans.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.556
Good evening, Central City.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.597
We've prepared
a special show for you.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.034
Tonight's festivities

33:44.120 --> 33:48.080
will feature several
expendable worker bees...

33:48.160 --> 33:51.949
the employees
of McCulloch Technologies.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.316
Unless the Flash comes down
here in the next 30 seconds

33:55.400 --> 33:57.232
and reveals his identity
to the world.

33:57.320 --> 33:58.470
Gucci?

34:00.200 --> 34:01.270
You don't want the money?

34:02.480 --> 34:03.880
Oh, no.
We want the money.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.920
We just wanted to make
a name for ourselves first.

34:05.960 --> 34:10.112
So, what, outing my dad makes
you legitimate Rogues?

34:10.199 --> 34:11.199
I trusted you.

34:13.480 --> 34:14.630
Oh, God.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.712
You sound just like
Silver Ghost...

34:16.800 --> 34:19.440
when I left her in Bolivia.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.830
At least you'll die fast.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.639
I'd say it's been
about 30 seconds, right?

34:23.719 --> 34:25.313
- Yeah.
- Right?

34:25.880 --> 34:28.031
Okay.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.157
Wait!

34:32.760 --> 34:34.956
I am here.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.759
All right, Speedy.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.230
Show us your true identity.
Mask off.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.616
Dad, please.
You do not have to do this.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.359
I have to.

34:42.440 --> 34:46.992
I am a man sitting alone
at the dinner table.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.594
Is he drunk?

34:51.679 --> 34:55.196
See, when you're in position

34:55.320 --> 34:58.074
to feed the world,

34:58.160 --> 35:00.516
it can make it hard
to be a father.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.478
You have to constantly
ask yourself,

35:02.560 --> 35:06.600
is what's right for the world
what's right for your child?

35:06.680 --> 35:09.957
- Hey, can we get on with it?
- Yes, um... yeah, uh...

35:10.040 --> 35:11.713
- No.
- What?

35:11.800 --> 35:14.395
Did you seriously think I was
gonna fall for this again?

35:19.400 --> 35:20.754
Ha!

35:20.840 --> 35:22.479
I phase right through
your blast.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.040
Ha! You can't stop
the Flash!

35:24.120 --> 35:26.351
No, I think the jig is up.

35:26.440 --> 35:27.715
Confused?

35:27.800 --> 35:29.553
Don't be.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.800
Holy shrap.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.439
How the hell
is this even possible?

35:37.520 --> 35:38.636
We bypassed security

35:38.720 --> 35:39.976
while you were busy
with General Cloud.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.310
And then you walked
us worker bees right inside.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.871
You're outnumbered, ladies.
Drop your weapons.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.554
Don't let them
hit that dampener.

35:49.640 --> 35:50.800
Get the hostages out of here.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.200
We'll handle the Rogues.

35:53.440 --> 35:54.760
This way. This way.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.469
- We gotta get back in there.
- Yeah.

36:02.520 --> 36:05.638
What the hell is that?

36:05.720 --> 36:07.359
You don't want to know.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.393
Cisco, we need
our powers back.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.896
Can you do something
about these bees?

36:21.920 --> 36:23.479
Hold tight.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.040
Iris!

36:41.640 --> 36:43.560
All right, we're not gonna
last here much longer.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.856
I'm gonna create a diversion.
Get ready to shoot the dampener.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.314
No, no.
Dad, it's too dangerous!

36:48.760 --> 36:49.830
Dad!

36:57.680 --> 37:00.195
He's lucky I don't throw
his ass off a roof.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.754
Nobody out-techs me.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.153
Damn it.
Ramon's in my phone.

37:12.240 --> 37:15.836
She's not getting out
of this one alive.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.077
Nora, wait!

37:24.800 --> 37:25.916
Dad! You've been hit.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.351
Are you okay?

37:32.440 --> 37:34.636
Yeah.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.916
I'm not the only one.

37:40.080 --> 37:41.799
You were here with me.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.200
The whole time.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.754
I abandoned you once.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.593
I'm never gonna do it again.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.791
So we should probably...

37:50.880 --> 37:52.314
Oh, yeah.
Definitely.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.399
The young Rogues.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.631
Not the nicest friends
you made there, kiddo.

38:09.720 --> 38:14.272
Yeah, I... thought
I could control them,

38:14.360 --> 38:16.352
steal the weapons back
after we lifted them,

38:16.480 --> 38:19.075
but I got in over my head.

38:19.160 --> 38:20.594
Even if it was
for a good reason.

38:20.680 --> 38:23.673
Nora, killing Cicada
is not a good reason.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.229
No, I-I wasn't trying
to kill Cicada.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.996
I needed this.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.390
It's a weapon built
from the solar reflector panels

38:38.480 --> 38:40.153
from the S.T.A.R. Labs
satellite,

38:40.240 --> 38:43.438
capable of destroying
any object down to its atoms,

38:43.520 --> 38:47.514
and it's the only thing that
can destroy Cicada's dagger.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.916
Nora, why didn't you
just tell us this?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.435
Because I wouldn't
have believed her.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.552
'Cause it's Thawne's plan.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.836
I knew how angry Dad was.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.072
And then you came
to the future without him.

39:02.160 --> 39:04.834
I just thought
he'd never believe me.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.355
Plus, I had to stay in
a seriously unschway headspace

39:07.440 --> 39:10.797
to use the negative
Speed Force.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.431
But I know now.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.830
I don't ever want to leave
you guys again.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.913
And if that means not following
through with Thawne's plan,

39:19.040 --> 39:20.952
I'm okay with that.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.271
I think we should use it.

39:28.360 --> 39:31.239
- You what?
- Barr, are you sure?

39:31.320 --> 39:32.754
We have to stop Cicada.

39:32.840 --> 39:35.514
I'm never gonna like
where this plan comes from.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.599
But if this thing works...

39:38.680 --> 39:40.911
sounds like our best shot.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.037
You really believe him?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.469
I believe in you, Nora.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.716
And I'm sorry
that I made you feel otherwise.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.153
Dad...

39:54.240 --> 39:55.336
that stuff I said earlier...

39:55.360 --> 39:57.511
I deserved it.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.557
I-I...

39:59.640 --> 40:02.599
I shouldn't have left you
in the future.

40:02.680 --> 40:06.833
I shouldn't have put
conditions on you coming home.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.957
I'm sorry.

40:09.040 --> 40:12.033
I love you.

40:14.160 --> 40:16.516
We both do.

40:16.640 --> 40:19.235
We're never gonna
leave you again, Nora.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.118
We promise.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.000
So what's the verdict?

40:31.080 --> 40:32.400
Nora's story checks out.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.676
This thing has got
a prismatic battery

40:34.760 --> 40:36.717
supercharging
its reflector panels.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.110
So if anything's gonna
destroy that dagger,

40:39.200 --> 40:42.113
it's this mirror gun.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.759
That may be easier said
than done.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.240
Why's that?

40:45.320 --> 40:46.976
We figured out what Cicada
took from my dad's lab.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.196
It's your cure prototypes.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.272
Why would she need those?
They're just prototypes.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.760
No, they're not
just prototypes.

40:52.840 --> 40:55.992
They're failed,
broken versions of the cure.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.595
If a meta-human takes that
without the proper treatment...

40:58.680 --> 41:00.353
They would die.

41:00.440 --> 41:02.875
Cicada has a lethal virus
on her hands.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.440
That's why she stole
the atomizer.

41:04.520 --> 41:05.954
So she can spread the virus.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.997
She has weaponized the cure.

41:08.080 --> 41:09.230
This is it.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.473
This is the nightmare.

41:12.560 --> 41:16.349
Cicada's gonna kill
every meta-human in the city.

41:27.880 --> 41:31.510
A rare, old bird
is the pelican,

41:31.600 --> 41:36.277
whose beak can hold more
than his belly can.

41:37.880 --> 41:40.759
He can hold in his beak...

41:40.840 --> 41:45.232
enough food for a week.
But I'm...

41:45.320 --> 41:47.437
Darned...

41:48.720 --> 41:51.872
if I know...

41:51.960 --> 41:55.431
how the hell he can.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.634
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
