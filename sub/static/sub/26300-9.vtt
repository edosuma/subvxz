WEBVTT

00:01.020 --> 00:02.436
- Previously on Star...
- Congrats.

00:02.460 --> 00:04.300
- Oh, so you're changing my name.
- I need to make music

00:04.310 --> 00:06.439
- that feeds my soul.
- I'm in need of a manager.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.856
Is you asking me to be your manager?

00:07.880 --> 00:09.140
Only if you saying yes.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.316
We have your husband.

00:10.340 --> 00:13.020
You have 24 hours to get $7,000 or else.

00:13.060 --> 00:15.180
Simone... I mean, you mean a lot to me.

00:15.220 --> 00:16.660
Why I still feel like a closet freak?

00:16.680 --> 00:17.949
I don't know how Noah's gonna react.

00:17.950 --> 00:19.350
You putting a distance between us.

00:19.390 --> 00:20.400
Gotta get it together.

00:20.410 --> 00:21.960
Every chance you get,
sniffing around my girl.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.940
Nothing happened. You broke her heart!

00:23.980 --> 00:26.310
You're being charged with money
laundering and drug trafficking.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.610
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

00:27.630 --> 00:29.180
I know you're covering up for Xander.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.300
Dad used to do things to
me when we were alone.

00:31.330 --> 00:33.380
As long as he didn't
touch you, it was okay.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.039
She was a cop. She was murdered.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.321
She discovered money was being
laundered through the club.

00:37.860 --> 00:39.720
Your services are no longer needed.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.110
What about my grandma?

00:49.660 --> 00:54.260
Hey! Happy Kwanzaa, bitch.
Look who's free.

00:54.290 --> 00:56.290
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hi.

00:56.330 --> 00:58.320
I like your little jail hair, though.

00:58.380 --> 01:00.470
Told you Xander's ass
wasn't worth doing no bid.

01:00.500 --> 01:04.000
I know. I promise you, I'm done
working out my daddy issues

01:04.030 --> 01:06.000
on a dude that think I'm trash.

01:06.020 --> 01:07.200
And a white boy at that.

01:07.220 --> 01:10.040
Okay, I was really on
some Olivia Pope mess,

01:10.070 --> 01:12.100
but a bitch is woke now

01:12.120 --> 01:14.510
and I'm-a work with these
pigs to bring his ass down.

01:14.540 --> 01:17.540
Wait, hold up. Didn't he
already threaten to kill you?

01:17.560 --> 01:19.680
You better stay your
stupid ass away from him.

01:19.720 --> 01:22.330
You worry too much about
me. I'm Teflon, sis.

01:22.340 --> 01:23.619
You know I got this.

01:23.620 --> 01:25.950
And once I skin his ass for good,

01:25.990 --> 01:29.190
we gonna celebrate
Christmas at my house.

01:29.230 --> 01:31.960
Wait, hold up. Now you know
we do Christmas at my house.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.300
Why we always got to do
Christmas at your house?

01:34.330 --> 01:36.340
- Because you can't cook.
- Wow.

01:36.350 --> 01:38.770
Okay, and this is Cott's
first Christmas with Jayden

01:38.800 --> 01:40.839
and he does not need to experience

01:40.840 --> 01:42.859
your dry-ass mac and cheese.

01:42.860 --> 01:45.220
Cott, she still mad at me?

01:45.240 --> 01:48.340
You killed her father.

01:48.380 --> 01:49.980
She ain't never gonna get over that.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.720
But you were her Titi Cassie.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.950
I mean, she liked you
more than she liked me.

01:56.090 --> 01:57.620
I'm-a work on fixing that

01:57.650 --> 02:00.690
'cause I'm back. I'm back
in this family for good.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.860
And don't hate on my mac
and cheese. It's bomb.

02:04.030 --> 02:06.360
Yeah, a atomic bomb.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.036
- We gonna stop right there.
- Listen, whatever.

02:08.060 --> 02:09.699
Come on, put some of these up for me.

02:09.759 --> 02:12.020
Just put that whole box
right there on the tree.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.080
I'll take off my heels then,
'cause we have a bitch

02:14.100 --> 02:15.386
- working already.
- That's great.

02:15.410 --> 02:18.540
Well, I should probably at
least tell Miss Carlotta

02:18.560 --> 02:19.570
that you're here.

02:19.590 --> 02:21.580
She'll probably start
asking why I'm hanging out

02:21.610 --> 02:23.610
in this nasty-ass trailer all the time.

02:23.650 --> 02:27.920
I know you trust her and I
know that you're family,

02:28.550 --> 02:31.080
but I don't want anybody
else involved in my mess.

02:31.220 --> 02:34.259
I don't even like that you are.

02:34.260 --> 02:37.860
But I'm your wife.

02:37.890 --> 02:40.090
We got to figure this out together.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.519
You know, I was thinking maybe

02:44.520 --> 02:46.330
we could give Nina a call?

02:46.370 --> 02:47.670
- Because she...
- No.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.240
No, we don't need them.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.110
No, but her and Mateo have connections.

02:51.140 --> 02:52.270
I said no, okay?

02:52.310 --> 02:54.319
I'm gonna figure this out.

02:54.320 --> 02:55.960
You trust me?

02:56.060 --> 02:58.080
I trust you.

02:58.140 --> 03:00.280
I've missed you, Mrs. Rivera.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.950
Say it again.

03:01.990 --> 03:05.150
I've missed you.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.560 --> 03:24.809
Thank you.

03:24.810 --> 03:26.720
Okay, okay, that's enough.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.500
You don't need all those wings.

03:31.580 --> 03:33.120
Or are you eating for all of us now?

03:33.160 --> 03:34.480
Is that what this is?

03:34.520 --> 03:35.920
Don't worry about what I'm eating.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.040
Worry about the fact that
Tyga ate this verse...

03:38.050 --> 03:39.199
Oh.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.919
... on "There For You."

03:40.920 --> 03:43.190
I'm performing it first up on my set.

03:43.230 --> 03:45.190
Damn, Star, save some
for the other people.

03:45.230 --> 03:47.960
Why is everybody clocking my plate?
Seriously.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.230
My son is hungry.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.619
Hey, did you get that
note from the doctor

03:50.620 --> 03:52.000
clearing you to perform?

03:52.040 --> 03:53.999
Oh, don't worry about it. It's all good.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.299
All right, 'cause Mateo is up my ass

03:55.300 --> 03:57.880
to make sure this festival
lives up to the hype,

03:57.940 --> 04:00.540
and Maurice can't wait to
see me fall on my face,

04:00.580 --> 04:02.380
which ain't gonna happen.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.040
I hate everybody at that table.

04:04.060 --> 04:06.280
It's that immigrant one
who I got a problem with.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.520
Bruce, come on now.

04:07.550 --> 04:09.620
- You know, his wife left him.
- What you say?

04:09.640 --> 04:10.900
- Yeah.
- Nina left him?

04:10.940 --> 04:13.119
Yes, ma'am. She chopped him.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.540
She got over it. Hi-ya, bitch.

04:15.590 --> 04:17.779
I suppose she fell in
love with somebody else.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.418
Her situation's straight
out of a telenovela.

04:19.420 --> 04:20.978
Excuse me everybody.

04:20.980 --> 04:22.880
Can I have your attention for a second?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.800
Star, baby, will you come up here?

04:24.830 --> 04:27.800
- No.
- Get your ass up there.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.370
- What is he doing?
- Come on.

04:29.410 --> 04:32.910
What are you doing? Go.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.930
I know that things are
about to get crazy

04:34.960 --> 04:37.140
with this festival,

04:37.180 --> 04:39.550
and our baby's gonna be
here in a couple of weeks.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.920
So I wanted to do this now.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.320
Baby, we've been through the fire.

04:44.350 --> 04:48.920
God knows that you are crazy as hell.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.440
This is true.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.240
Oh, my God.

05:02.210 --> 05:04.420
But you have me for a lifetime

05:04.540 --> 05:07.120
if you just say yes.

05:09.210 --> 05:11.900
Excuse me, Star Davis?

05:13.900 --> 05:15.820
Yes.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.980
- Oh.
- You've been served.

05:19.140 --> 05:21.090
- Damn it.
- Get out of here, you jerk.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.300
Bitch, don't ever take
no yellow envelope.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.940
I know that. I was a little distracted.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.400
Open it, just...

05:28.560 --> 05:31.080
- What is it?
- Oh, boy.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.160
It's a cease and desist

05:33.200 --> 05:35.960
for copyright infringement
on "There For You."

05:36.420 --> 05:38.580
They're saying I can't
perform it at the festival.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.710
Is it real?

05:42.750 --> 05:44.700
Yeah.

05:45.620 --> 05:47.520
Damn.

06:09.220 --> 06:10.850
So I can't sing the
biggest song of my career

06:10.860 --> 06:12.280
on the biggest night of my life?

06:12.310 --> 06:13.920
I should've known that your stealing ass

06:13.930 --> 06:14.939
stole that beat.

06:14.940 --> 06:16.680
Yo, pregnancy brain
got you dumb as hell.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.899
Well, who the hell did it, then?

06:17.900 --> 06:19.260
Look, I got the lawyers looking into it,

06:19.270 --> 06:21.030
but you're gonna have to
come up with a plan "B."

06:21.050 --> 06:22.760
This is what my fans
want to hear, Carlotta.

06:22.770 --> 06:23.789
It's no plan "B."

06:23.790 --> 06:25.350
We gonna figure this out,

06:25.390 --> 06:28.100
but right now we need to focus
on the Goodbye album release.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.360
Which is why Take 3's
opening on the main stage.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.590
After that, we'll hit the
red carpet to promote

06:32.600 --> 06:34.719
the Black Ivy trailer.
Once that happens,

06:34.720 --> 06:36.680
we'll direct everybody
to the solo performance.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.230
Wait, can we just make sure

06:39.270 --> 06:41.340
my inners are synced up with my track?

06:41.370 --> 06:44.230
I just really don't need
any type of sound issue.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.240
Don't worry about the sound,

06:45.250 --> 06:46.770
I got that. It'll be good.

06:46.810 --> 06:48.020
Well, look, I'm locked, loaded,

06:48.040 --> 06:49.700
- and ready to go.
- Well, I hope so

06:49.710 --> 06:51.000
'cause all eyes are on you.

06:51.020 --> 06:52.296
The last performance of the festival

06:52.320 --> 06:53.980
is the legacy of the whole damn thing.

06:54.020 --> 06:56.200
All right, let's get it.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.520
Mm-hmm.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.920
Still taking credit for my work, huh?

07:00.960 --> 07:03.200
We did it together,
and Mateo knows that.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.600
I guess that mistletoe means

07:06.610 --> 07:08.140
you can kiss my black ass.

07:08.330 --> 07:10.430
Been there, done that.

07:10.470 --> 07:11.830
And you did it wrong.

07:11.870 --> 07:13.740
Merry Christmas, Carlotta.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.900
What are they gonna do? Sue me
for singing my own damn song?

07:21.910 --> 07:23.740
- Probably.
- This is so stupid.

07:23.780 --> 07:26.110
Star, listen, it's not
like it's your only hit.

07:26.150 --> 07:27.580
You have other songs.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.230
Including the one you did with Noah.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.550
Why don't you just ask him?

07:30.590 --> 07:33.550
- I'm not singing with Noah.
- Why? Because of me?

07:33.590 --> 07:35.920
Listen, you don't have
to protect my feelings,

07:35.980 --> 07:39.260
with this or with the proposal.

07:39.300 --> 07:43.580
Jackson, I'm good with
where we're at, all right?

07:44.330 --> 07:46.040
We're having this little guy,

07:46.080 --> 07:48.580
I'm cool with waking up to your
face every morning, but...

07:48.740 --> 07:50.070
But what?

07:50.110 --> 07:53.540
But we're not ready for that. Come on.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.510
And I've never been that girl.

07:55.550 --> 07:56.680
I'm sorry.

07:56.710 --> 08:00.310
Yo, Star, did you get
my Christmas present?

08:00.350 --> 08:02.200
You know I had my people, uh,

08:02.240 --> 08:05.490
just dig up a little dirt on
you... I-I mean the song,

08:05.520 --> 08:07.630
and it sounded so familiar.

08:07.640 --> 08:08.806
You know, my boy did that beat.

08:08.830 --> 08:11.440
You're the one that did this to me?

08:13.330 --> 08:14.960
That makes a lot of sense, actually.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.520
Hey, it's all love. Look.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.139
I should knock you upside the head.

08:19.140 --> 08:20.580
- Don't do that. Look, look...
- Stop. Stop.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.670
Good luck having people show
up to that wack-ass event

08:23.710 --> 08:25.320
without that wack-ass hit.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.760
Oh, good aim!

08:27.790 --> 08:29.210
I like that.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.120
Soon as this baby drop,
I'm coming for you.

08:31.210 --> 08:34.039
Hey, Tim Tebow, yo, you goofy as hell.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.549
He's so lucky I'm pregnant.

08:41.510 --> 08:43.719
Ooh, girl, thank you. Hooked me up.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.500
They can't fix no black hair
in my all-white neighborhood.

08:46.520 --> 08:49.320
Last time I walked out of there
looking like ASAP Rocky.

08:49.350 --> 08:51.250
- Yo, you seen ASAP Rocky?
- Cotton.

08:51.290 --> 08:53.300
Look like Fetty Wap and
Whoopi Goldberg had a baby.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.090
I don't usually do this, but I
got you all right, Miss Pat.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.750
Cotton, can you hurry up?

08:57.760 --> 09:00.030
You said we were gonna go see Santa.

09:00.060 --> 09:02.199
You ain't whooped his bad ass yet?

09:02.200 --> 09:03.380
Boy, Santa ain't real.

09:03.420 --> 09:04.620
- Stop.
- Santa is real.

09:04.630 --> 09:06.330
- Santa ain't real.
- That's enough, Pat.

09:06.370 --> 09:08.439
I'm out of here. Santa ain't real!

09:08.440 --> 09:09.890
- Yes, he is!
- Hey.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.500
You didn't see me talking to my client?

09:11.560 --> 09:13.780
You said that we're gonna go see Santa.

09:13.790 --> 09:15.720
We are. When I take you
and when I'm done.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.940
- And when I say so.
- And Santa don't like badasses,

09:18.980 --> 09:21.650
so go upstairs now, Jayden.

09:21.680 --> 09:22.840
These kids.

09:22.850 --> 09:24.499
Ti, I had that covered.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.100
And what are you doing here anyway?

09:26.250 --> 09:27.950
Look, niece, we a family.

09:27.990 --> 09:30.260
He's just as much as
mine as he is yours.

09:30.290 --> 09:31.590
It takes a village.

09:31.630 --> 09:34.100
And I know ours ain't
been that good, but look.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.899
I'm out of jail and away from Xander.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.160
I got my head on straight now.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.470
Look, I want you to know that I...

09:42.500 --> 09:44.700
I can't make up for what I did to Jahil,

09:44.740 --> 09:48.940
but I can prove to you every
day that I'm sorry as hell.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.840
Okay? All of it's behind me.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.450
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.600
You promise?

09:54.620 --> 09:58.720
I do. Hand to God.

09:58.750 --> 10:01.350
I never thought I'd say this,

10:01.390 --> 10:04.660
but I miss your little bougie ass.

10:04.690 --> 10:06.080
Yeah, I miss you, too.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.560
But me and Derek,

10:07.600 --> 10:09.460
- we just...
- Hey. I know.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.839
- I know.
- So how's your case?

10:12.840 --> 10:15.880
They say they're backlogged.
They ain't never gonna process

10:15.900 --> 10:17.700
that rape kit, so I just

10:17.720 --> 10:21.710
take it one day at a time,
trying to get back to me.

10:21.740 --> 10:25.140
Yeah, me, too.

10:25.180 --> 10:27.610
I, uh...

10:27.650 --> 10:29.540
keep having these panic attacks

10:29.550 --> 10:31.750
and I'm supposed to have
the biggest performance

10:31.790 --> 10:36.660
of my solo career in
front of 25,000 people

10:36.690 --> 10:40.000
and they all just want me to
live up to my dad's name.

10:40.090 --> 10:42.190
That's never what I wanted.

10:42.230 --> 10:45.400
- I just want to stand on my own.
- You, uh,

10:45.430 --> 10:47.200
need something to take the edge off?

10:48.060 --> 10:52.070
I got some...

10:52.110 --> 10:54.040
OG Kush.

10:54.050 --> 10:57.160
Nah, I-I'm-I'm so good.

10:57.980 --> 10:59.880
All right.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.919
It's here if you need a hit.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.280
- Okay?
- Okay.

11:03.380 --> 11:05.680
I have festival prep to do.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.100
- I'll probably see you later.
- Okay.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.900
Why you got to be so stubborn?

11:18.930 --> 11:21.370
Tell her you were working
with the cops because of me.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.950
We're not about to talk
about this right now.

11:22.970 --> 11:26.990
Fine. But you make sure
your little hardheaded ass

11:27.000 --> 11:28.286
shows up at the Mission tomorrow.

11:28.310 --> 11:29.900
I'm feeding the homeless.

11:29.940 --> 11:33.180
Making my special green beans.

11:33.210 --> 11:35.040
This festival is kicking my ass.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.160
I mean, who plans a
festival on Christmas Eve?

11:37.240 --> 11:39.440
Like, bitch,

11:39.480 --> 11:41.220
you ain't got no damn presents to wrap?

11:41.260 --> 11:43.240
- Crazy.
- I'm gonna need a little

11:43.280 --> 11:44.880
mini vacay after this.

11:45.060 --> 11:47.680
How about, uh, New Year's Eve?

11:47.860 --> 11:49.730
Really?

11:49.760 --> 11:52.300
I got a singing gig in New York.
You want to come?

11:52.330 --> 11:54.170
Okay.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.830
- You plan it, I...
- Yep. Noah.

11:55.870 --> 11:58.370
- Oh, you beat me here, huh?
- Yeah, man,

11:58.380 --> 11:59.990
I just thought I'd go over

12:00.000 --> 12:01.716
- some manager stuff with Bruce.
- What's up, Bruce?

12:01.740 --> 12:03.480
And I know you got all
that pressure on you

12:03.510 --> 12:05.710
- after what happened on tour.
- Pop, come on.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.250
I'm almost six months sober.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.530
Yeah, and we gonna keep
it that way, right?

12:08.540 --> 12:09.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:09.550 --> 12:12.040
- Right?
- Bae, he got it.

12:12.150 --> 12:15.940
Yeah, I... yep. Mm-mm.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.740
What's up with y'all? Y-Y'all together?

12:18.820 --> 12:20.790
Nah. Just old friends.

12:20.830 --> 12:23.920
- He was giving me advice.
- Hmm, okay.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.070
I'm gonna go check on the girls.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.170
- A'ight. I'll hit you up later.
- No.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.240
I'm done with the
manager talk for today.

12:34.740 --> 12:36.656
Last year, Ayanna gave you an advantage,

12:36.680 --> 12:38.426
but I'm putting it all
on the table, Carlotta.

12:38.450 --> 12:40.810
As far as I'm concerned,
you're a nonfactor.

12:40.850 --> 12:43.780
I've taken a lot of losses.
Andy, Jahil...

12:43.820 --> 12:45.620
Look, you ain't the
only one with losses.

12:45.650 --> 12:47.190
And I ain't losing again.

12:47.220 --> 12:49.960
The whole city is excited
about Rhythm and Bells.

12:49.990 --> 12:52.260
And this Goodbye album is
supposed to be the truth.

12:52.290 --> 12:54.060
Y'all really ready to say good-bye?

12:54.100 --> 12:56.530
You know, we're really just
trying to grow as artists.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.730
Going solo is risky.
Luckily for you, Star,

12:59.770 --> 13:01.700
you had some momentum
straight out the gate.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.480
"There For You" is still a bop.

13:03.520 --> 13:06.279
Alex, this is your first
major performance

13:06.280 --> 13:07.600
- as a solo artist...
- Yeah.

13:07.610 --> 13:10.220
... even though you were signed
to your father's label at 15.

13:10.340 --> 13:12.420
I got a lot of love for you,

13:12.500 --> 13:15.780
but let's be real, the
label canned your album

13:15.800 --> 13:17.419
and yet, here you are.

13:17.420 --> 13:20.020
You know, not everybody has
what it takes to go solo.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.550
And if you weren't ready then,

13:21.590 --> 13:23.790
what makes you so sure you're ready now?

13:23.820 --> 13:25.206
You know what? This interview is over.

13:25.230 --> 13:27.000
- I just have a few more questions.
- No, no, no.

13:27.010 --> 13:28.540
No more questions.
That's enough questions.

13:28.550 --> 13:30.340
- Alex, calm down, okay?
- Yo, why you coming for her...

13:30.350 --> 13:32.006
Don't let it get in your
head, just breathe.

13:32.030 --> 13:34.770
I can't breathe. Can't breathe.

13:34.800 --> 13:35.959
Carlotta, what is happening?

13:35.960 --> 13:37.069
- Is she okay?
- Deep breaths.

13:37.070 --> 13:38.696
She's gonna be fine. Come
on, honey, just breathe.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.170
Should we-should we... ?

13:40.210 --> 13:41.580
Are we getting this?

13:41.600 --> 13:43.480
Hey! I said the interview is over.

13:43.510 --> 13:45.540
What part of that don't
you unders... Move.

13:45.580 --> 13:47.680
- You brat...
- I want a divorce.

13:49.700 --> 13:50.959
We can't do this.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.400
Find somewhere else to stay tonight.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.370
Hey. Look, about earlier,

13:59.400 --> 14:01.570
I-I ain't ready to tell Noah yet.

14:01.940 --> 14:04.200
- He's a grown man.
- I know.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.740
He's a grown-ass man, Bobby.

14:05.770 --> 14:07.810
And he knows his father got a life.

14:07.840 --> 14:11.220
I just got my son back. I ain't
ready to lose him again.

14:11.240 --> 14:14.220
- I'd make you lose him?
- If I start parading us around

14:14.320 --> 14:16.380
after what I did to him
all those years ago,

14:16.420 --> 14:18.550
how-how you think that's
gonna make him feel?

14:18.590 --> 14:23.970
Look, I've spent a very long
time learning to love myself,

14:23.980 --> 14:26.330
and you not gonna hide me.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.740
I'm not gonna lessen myself so that

14:28.750 --> 14:31.900
you can live some fake reality.

14:31.930 --> 14:34.700
Even if I do love you.

14:34.770 --> 14:37.170
Wait. You-you love me?

14:37.200 --> 14:39.640
Yeah.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.840
My stupid ass love you.

14:50.620 --> 14:54.020
Wow, this is great...

14:54.160 --> 14:56.090
- You lied to my face.
- Oh...

14:56.120 --> 14:58.040
- Noah...
- And-and you know, the funny thing is,

14:58.140 --> 14:59.620
I would have been cool, Pop.

14:59.660 --> 15:01.060
But you just keep lying to me.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.400
Noah...

15:03.500 --> 15:06.030
N-Noah!

15:06.070 --> 15:08.460
Wait, Noah!

15:22.840 --> 15:23.840
Hey.

15:23.850 --> 15:27.220
Yo, Star, don't forget: ♪ I'm
there for you, bitches. ♪

15:28.620 --> 15:31.620

15:38.170 --> 15:40.700
- Punk-ass bitch.
- Forget about Dini.

15:40.730 --> 15:43.170
All right, y'all? You up in five.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.359
Now, I know I've been making
this whole thing about me

15:45.360 --> 15:46.840
and my job, but it's not.

15:46.870 --> 15:48.610
It's about y'all.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.980
- Take 3.
- I can't believe I'm saying this,

15:51.010 --> 15:52.810
but I'm actually gonna miss this.

15:52.850 --> 15:54.420
No, you not.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.780

15:55.790 --> 15:57.200

You about to be Alex Crane 2.0

16:00.250 --> 16:01.700

Stardi B in half a minute.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.860
Stardi B?

16:03.870 --> 16:06.520
I just can't believe we're
actually breaking up.

16:09.840 --> 16:12.800
We're not. We're leveling up.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.740
- There you go.
- Call it a hiatus.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.740
I ain't never giving up
on this group. Sorry.

16:16.770 --> 16:18.886

- Course not.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.030
You all enjoy your dinner.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.679
You should be there.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.299
Makes no sense you throwing away

18:30.300 --> 18:33.170
what you have over you
trying to help me.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.310
Is it me, or it seem like

18:36.340 --> 18:38.210
there was way more volunteers last year?

18:38.250 --> 18:41.079
Or maybe it was you moving faster.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.320
You silly.

18:46.350 --> 18:48.150
You know, despite everything going on,

18:48.180 --> 18:49.350
you still here giving back.

18:49.390 --> 18:51.119
Yeah, well, and I'm gonna be here

18:51.120 --> 18:52.890
till everyone has a full belly.

18:52.930 --> 18:54.360
Mm, love you.

18:54.370 --> 18:56.230
- Love you, too.
- I'll help you with this.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.030
No, no, let me take these rolls in.

19:00.900 --> 19:04.060
Mike-Mike, man...

19:04.100 --> 19:06.300
I'm about to give you
the ride of your life.

19:06.470 --> 19:08.610
Grandma, what's wrong?

19:20.140 --> 19:22.940
Grandma, is that the man who hurt you?

19:24.460 --> 19:26.310
That's the man who hurt you.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.339
No, wait.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.099
- No, no, Derek! Please, please...
- No...

19:29.100 --> 19:32.180
Please, take me home. Come
on, take me home, please.

19:32.220 --> 19:35.340
Please, please, come on...

19:55.580 --> 19:57.610
These came for you, Mrs. Rivera.

19:57.650 --> 20:00.279
Um, do you mind just putting
them in my trailer for me?

20:00.280 --> 20:01.750
- Yeah. Gotcha.

Hey.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.180
What the hell are you doing here?

20:13.220 --> 20:14.900
One photo and ICE could grab you.

20:14.930 --> 20:17.460
Stop thinking that.
Tonight is Christmas Eve,

20:17.530 --> 20:19.680
and all I want to do is
watch my amazing wife.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.700
You wanted something for
yourself and you got it.

20:22.770 --> 20:24.210
I'm here.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.250
Yeah. I just don't know why,

20:26.260 --> 20:28.160
I feel like the rug's gonna get pulled.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.510
Angel Rivera?

20:35.220 --> 20:37.480
If you even think about turning
him in, I swear to God,

20:37.500 --> 20:39.530
I'll let everybody know
about your money problems.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.080
So you're trying to threaten me?

20:42.190 --> 20:44.160
I was him once.

20:44.190 --> 20:47.230
Fix your lipstick and go sell my movie.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.299
Where is it?

20:55.300 --> 20:59.020
Where is it?

21:07.480 --> 21:10.560
Whoa, what the... what the hell, Derek?

21:10.650 --> 21:12.540
What are you doing with a gun?

21:12.580 --> 21:14.800
Why are you even here?
Don't you have a show?

21:14.860 --> 21:16.400
I'm nervous. I need
to take the edge off.

21:16.410 --> 21:18.190
But tell me what's going on.

21:18.230 --> 21:21.260
Okay? You need to talk to me.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.660
You owe me that.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.870
The man who hurt my grandmother
is in the Bankhead Crew.

21:26.900 --> 21:30.740
And that girl you saw me with
is the detective on the case.

21:30.770 --> 21:33.770
Was the detective... she, she died.

21:33.810 --> 21:35.180
I've been working as an informant,

21:35.210 --> 21:37.410
just trying to help them find anything.

21:37.450 --> 21:39.510
But then tonight...

21:42.490 --> 21:44.450
... I found the guy who
raped my grandmother.

21:44.490 --> 21:46.890
And I'm-a go handle it. For good.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.990
Look, you-you need to give me the gun.

21:52.300 --> 21:56.260
But if you kill him, she won't
be able to come back from that.

21:56.300 --> 21:59.600
You're the best man I know.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.200
And I can't lose you again.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.040
So, please.

22:04.070 --> 22:05.900
It's okay.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.260
Gonna go to your show now?

22:26.300 --> 22:31.480
No. No, I should stay here with you.

22:31.630 --> 22:33.430
Are you scared?

22:33.470 --> 22:34.969
I've watched you try and outrun

22:34.970 --> 22:38.340
your father's name for two years.

22:38.370 --> 22:40.200
That's your name too.

22:42.150 --> 22:43.680
When you go on that stage,
I want you to be that girl

22:43.700 --> 22:46.120
who came from New York.

22:46.980 --> 22:48.720
I want you to go out
there and be the girl

22:48.750 --> 22:50.250

23:18.690 --> 23:20.010
How was the trailer premiere?

23:20.050 --> 23:22.950
It was different.

23:22.990 --> 23:25.490
A lot of eyes on me.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.790
And only me.

23:26.820 --> 23:29.990
Right, so why do you...
why do you look unhappy?

23:30.030 --> 23:31.730
I'm not unhappy, I'm fine.

23:31.760 --> 23:35.630
I just... we need to focus
on your solo performance.

23:35.670 --> 23:36.800
I'm trying.

23:36.830 --> 23:38.900
I don't know what to do.

23:39.420 --> 23:42.200
Lil Dini's people are watching
me like a hawk, though.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.020
You could stop staring
at me like a criminal;

23:45.040 --> 23:46.910
I'm not gonna sing the damn song.

23:46.940 --> 23:50.310
They fronting. It's all right.

23:50.350 --> 23:53.350
I'm gonna have to go out there
and tell those people the truth.

23:53.380 --> 23:54.450
I can't deliver.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.420
Or you can go up there with me.

23:58.180 --> 24:01.520
Jackson thinks we should open
up your set with our duet.

24:01.560 --> 24:04.770
I mean, I think it'll
definitely get people

24:04.780 --> 24:06.140
hyped for your solo stuff.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.900
Thank you, but...

24:09.930 --> 24:12.320
I already told you no, Jackson.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.370
Baby, will you just
stop being so stubborn

24:14.380 --> 24:15.700
for once in your life?

24:15.740 --> 24:17.440
I know you're trying to be loyal to me.

24:17.470 --> 24:20.470
But you've waited your
whole life for this night.

24:20.510 --> 24:22.240
If that means going up there with Noah,

24:22.280 --> 24:23.710
then that's what you're gonna do.

24:30.590 --> 24:32.150
Ask me again.

24:32.190 --> 24:34.220
Ask you what?

24:34.260 --> 24:37.690
I'm not getting on my
knee. Ask me again.

24:37.730 --> 24:39.830
Are you serious?

24:46.140 --> 24:49.700
Baby...

24:51.110 --> 24:53.140
- Oh my, God.
- What's wrong? Are you okay?

24:53.180 --> 24:55.510
My water just broke.

24:55.550 --> 24:57.140
My water just broke; I'm having a baby.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.199
- Okay, okay...
- I'm gonna go

24:58.200 --> 24:59.240
- get Miss Carlotta.
- I'm having a baby right now.

24:59.250 --> 25:00.500
- Okay, baby...
- Everyone keep calm

25:00.510 --> 25:01.726
- while I go get Miss Carlotta.
- Just breathe.

25:01.750 --> 25:02.950
I don't know what to do.

25:02.990 --> 25:05.150
- We need some help.
- Where's the paramedics?

25:05.190 --> 25:07.220
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

25:07.260 --> 25:08.420
Can we get some help, please?

25:20.100 --> 25:24.040
Taking your money, take that.

25:24.340 --> 25:26.370
And this drive.

25:26.410 --> 25:27.810
Your drive.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.020
Come on, real quick.

25:33.050 --> 25:35.020
The kids will be home any second.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.820
Oh, you keep talking

25:36.850 --> 25:39.120
and I'll stick another one in you.

25:44.890 --> 25:47.000
You know...

25:47.040 --> 25:48.560
you are the only woman

25:48.660 --> 25:52.370
that I have ever loved.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.700
You know that, right?

25:53.740 --> 25:56.720
Hmm.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.160
You ain't even worth the bullet.

26:15.190 --> 26:17.720
Mm-hmm.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.460
- I'm here, Star.
- He's not supposed to come yet.

26:23.470 --> 26:25.770
It is time to push this baby
out; the baby is coming.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.239
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.639
Your mother did it, I did it.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.270
Star Davis, you will push this baby out.

26:30.310 --> 26:31.920
- You can-you can do it.
- All right, here we go now.

26:31.940 --> 26:34.280
- Come on, now. Push. Push.
- Come on, baby.

26:34.310 --> 26:36.660
- Push! Push, push, push, come on!
- Come on.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.756
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

26:38.780 --> 26:41.480
That's it, that's it, I see it!
I see it; it's coming!

26:41.520 --> 26:43.000
- Come on, baby. Come on.
- Push, baby. Push.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.520
- Push this baby out. There we go.
- Right, one more time.

26:45.550 --> 26:46.970
All right, come on, come on.

26:46.990 --> 26:48.700
Come on, you got this. You
got this, you got this.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.490
You did it. You did it.

26:50.530 --> 26:51.930
- Oh.
- My gosh.

26:51.960 --> 26:56.110
- Oh my, God. Oh my, God!
- He's okay.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.659
- Is he okay? Is he okay?
- Oh, he's okay.

26:57.660 --> 26:59.230
He's okay.

27:04.940 --> 27:07.439
It's okay, it's okay.

27:11.110 --> 27:14.050
Hi, hi.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.549
He's okay.

27:18.320 --> 27:21.079
He's okay.

27:21.080 --> 27:24.760
He's okay.

27:28.060 --> 27:29.439
It's okay.

27:29.440 --> 27:34.740
Jackson, Jackson, I didn't know.

27:35.100 --> 27:37.180
I didn't know, I didn't...

27:38.680 --> 27:41.410
I didn't know.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.140
I didn't know, Noah.

27:43.180 --> 27:45.480
Noah, I didn't know; I'm sorry.

27:45.510 --> 27:47.310
We got to get you to the hospital.

27:47.350 --> 27:49.390
- It's okay, sweetie.
- It's okay.

27:55.220 --> 27:58.460
I really had no idea.

27:58.490 --> 28:01.530
They told me the wrong date at
my first appointment and...

28:01.560 --> 28:04.830
I just never second-guessed it.

28:04.860 --> 28:07.300
All I was trying to do
was give him something

28:07.330 --> 28:10.140
more normal than what we had.

28:12.740 --> 28:14.840
I tried to force a fairy-tale.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.490
But that doesn't happen
for people like us.

28:17.530 --> 28:20.460
But you got a perfect
little prince out of it.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.570
I did.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.640
We have a baby.

28:28.670 --> 28:29.940
We do.

28:34.740 --> 28:37.780
Speaking of families, I got
to tell you something.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.880
I should've told you earlier, but, um...

28:43.790 --> 28:46.590
Angel snuck back into
the country for me.

28:46.620 --> 28:50.960
I still do believe we're gonna
all get our happy ending.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.380
I'm gonna ask Mateo for help.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.280
Anyway, you want me to
go get the daddies?

28:58.340 --> 29:02.300
I want you to not call
them that ever again.

29:02.340 --> 29:05.110
Okay, um, I'll go get the, uh...

29:05.140 --> 29:07.880
- The boys.
- The, yeah, th-those guys.

29:13.660 --> 29:16.600
Look, Jackson,

29:16.660 --> 29:18.240
when we were on tour...

29:18.280 --> 29:20.561
Come on, man. I'm not trying
to talk about that right now.

29:24.790 --> 29:26.140
She wants to see y'all both.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.440
I know we better get
somebody on this main stage

29:34.470 --> 29:36.120
before these ticket holders go crazy.

29:36.130 --> 29:37.130
What'd I miss?

29:37.140 --> 29:38.710
So word is,

29:38.740 --> 29:40.740
Star ho-ish ass done had Noah's baby

29:40.780 --> 29:42.110
right after proposing to Jackson.

29:42.150 --> 29:44.550
This is gonna burn
Twitter to the ground.

29:44.580 --> 29:46.280
Star had Noah's baby?

29:46.320 --> 29:48.420
Merry gagging Christmas.

29:48.450 --> 29:51.190
Now we got to find a replacement
for them on the main stage.

29:51.220 --> 29:53.230
The festival is riding
on the closing act.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.920
What's this I hear about Noah and Star?

29:54.960 --> 29:56.800
Listen, I already have
a call out to GiGi.

29:56.820 --> 29:59.800
- If she can get here, then we...
- Put me on the main stage.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.550
Premiering a couple of songs
and closing a festival

30:01.560 --> 30:03.580
- are two different things.
- That's too risky.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.920
Look, Carlotta, I can do this.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.520
Okay? I'm ready.

30:10.710 --> 30:11.870
Put her on.

30:11.910 --> 30:14.240
All right.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.740
If she doesn't blow this out
of the water, it's on you.

30:16.780 --> 30:18.950
Shut up.

30:44.240 --> 30:49.080
I hope you know I wasn't lying...

30:49.110 --> 30:51.040
to either of you.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.660
Can I hold him?

31:03.390 --> 31:05.330
Okay.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.230
That's a good yawn.

31:34.790 --> 31:36.680
- You got him?
- Yeah.

31:37.790 --> 31:40.220
Hey.

31:40.360 --> 31:43.920
I got you, I got you, I got you.

31:47.970 --> 31:50.120
Jackson.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.780
I just need a minute, Star.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.000
He's beautiful.

32:14.860 --> 32:17.860
He's perfect.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.840
Sorry, folks, Noah Brooks will
not be performing tonight,

32:26.860 --> 32:29.200
but we will not leave y'all hanging.

32:29.280 --> 32:34.160
Taking his place on the main
stage is Alexandra Crane.

32:35.660 --> 32:38.020
Oh, so you're ashamed of my name.

32:41.020 --> 32:43.860

35:39.500 --> 35:41.520
He's perfect.

35:41.970 --> 35:43.230
He is.

35:43.270 --> 35:45.640
So was your performance.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.300
I saw it. You broke the Internet.

35:47.340 --> 35:50.219
- Did I?
- You did. I saw it.

35:50.220 --> 35:52.219
- Girl, it was so dope.
- Thank you.

35:52.220 --> 35:53.250
If I didn't just have him,

35:53.260 --> 35:54.680
and if I wasn't in such a good mood,

35:54.700 --> 35:56.280
- I'd be jealous.
- Of course.

35:56.310 --> 35:57.950
Actually, I am jealous.

35:57.980 --> 35:59.120
And of that hair.

35:59.150 --> 36:00.530
I mean, my blonde could never...

36:00.550 --> 36:02.520
You like it, don't you?

36:07.990 --> 36:11.660
Let's give them a little time to talk.

36:11.700 --> 36:12.960
Hi.

36:16.470 --> 36:19.670
You know, I was up all
night thinking about this.

36:19.700 --> 36:24.310
Okay, so when Noah and I were on tour,

36:24.340 --> 36:25.810
before you got there...

36:25.840 --> 36:27.760
Star, I didn't come here
for an explanation.

36:27.830 --> 36:31.240
Well, I think we should
at least talk about this.

36:31.300 --> 36:32.930
And I think I should move out.

36:32.970 --> 36:34.500
I'm not mad at you,

36:34.510 --> 36:36.540
I just thought he was gonna be my son.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.870
Good-bye, Star.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.060
Figured you'd be here, man.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.900
Whenever you got upset as a kid,

37:05.930 --> 37:07.740
you'd just bury yourself in schoolwork.

37:07.820 --> 37:11.140
I'm not upset with you or-or Bruce.

37:11.170 --> 37:13.810
Bruce is good people.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.159
So are you, half the time.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.580
Then what's wrong?

37:17.610 --> 37:19.980
Star had a baby last night.

37:21.580 --> 37:24.340
- It's mine.
- Oh.

37:24.450 --> 37:27.090
Okay, yeah, uh,

37:27.120 --> 37:29.660
how you feel about that?

37:29.760 --> 37:33.360
I-I don't know how I feel yet.

37:35.460 --> 37:39.530
All of a sudden... I'm a father.

37:39.570 --> 37:42.600
I look down at him, and I see me.

37:42.640 --> 37:47.770
I look at me... I see you.

37:47.810 --> 37:50.210
Hey, man, you seeing
that part all wrong.

37:50.250 --> 37:52.400
You are gonna be a great father.

37:52.420 --> 37:54.179
How do you know that?

37:54.180 --> 37:56.156
I mean, it's not like I had
a great example to follow.

37:56.180 --> 37:58.550
Nah, nah.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.220
- I'm sorry...
- Nah, nah, nah, no.

38:00.260 --> 38:01.620
You know what, you're right, son.

38:01.660 --> 38:03.760
Let me tell you, that's why.

38:03.790 --> 38:06.590
You know what not to do.

38:06.630 --> 38:08.430
You ain't gonna run scared.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.430
Lie, disappoint like me.

38:10.470 --> 38:12.260
I-I'm still out here learning.

38:12.360 --> 38:15.340
You are everything I never was.

38:15.370 --> 38:17.570
All of it.

38:17.610 --> 38:20.080
Come here, come here.

38:21.410 --> 38:23.680
All right, look, um,

38:23.710 --> 38:25.660
I'm just saying, I would
like to meet him one day,

38:25.670 --> 38:26.670
whenever you ready.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.050
Of course, Grandpa.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.580
I wouldn't have it no other way.

39:38.990 --> 39:41.190
He had you whipped for about 15 years.

39:41.220 --> 39:43.460
He could put it down like
a black man, though.

39:43.490 --> 39:45.250

42:42.240 --> 42:43.280
