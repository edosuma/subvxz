WE WERE MISERABLE
WITH EACH OTHER.

14:51.673 --> 14:54.632
-WELL, THIS TIME,

14:58.375 --> 15:01.074
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.032
BUT HOBIE AND I ARE HAPPY

WE DON'T WANT TO JUST PICK UP
AND MOVE TO PHOENIX.

15:05.382 --> 15:08.690
-BECAUSE THERE'S NO OCEAN?
-BECAUSE THERE'S NO REASON.

15:08.820 --> 15:12.085
-FINE. YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S MY LIFE. WHO AM I
TO IMPOSE IT ON YOU?

15:12.737 --> 15:14.914

16:11.492 --> 16:14.321
OH, BABY! IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.
YOU WERE HAVING A DREAM.

16:14.451 --> 16:17.106
-NO, MOM, IT WASN'T A DREAM.
-YES, HONEY, IT WAS A DREAM.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.936
-REMEMBER THE EMERGENCY RESCUE
I WENT ON TONIGHT?

16:21.067 --> 16:22.329
-YES.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.940
-A LITTLE BOY DROWNED.
HE WAS ONLY 12.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.463
-OH.
-BUT, SEE...

16:27.160 --> 16:29.814
WE WERE DOING A BODY SEARCH,
AND I TOTALLY FREAKED OUT.

16:30.424 --> 16:34.341
-OH, BABY. OH, NO WONDER
YOU HAD A NIGHTMARE.

16:34.471 --> 16:37.083
-MOM, SEE, THE THING IS,
I DIDN'T FIND THE BODY.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.520
AS SOON AS I WENT UNDER WATER,
I FREAKED OUT.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.610
-HONEY, YOU WERE AFRAID
THAT YOU WOULD FIND THE BODY.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.133
NOW, THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.266
-I JUST DON'T KNOW THOUGH.

16:46.396 --> 16:49.051
I MEAN, I REALLY FEEL LIKE
IT'S SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT.

16:49.878 --> 16:53.012
-NO, HONEY. NO, IT'S OKAY.

16:54.187 --> 16:57.103
IT'S OKAY. OH.

17:33.965 --> 17:36.403
-I KNOW WHY
YOU LOVE THIS SO MUCH.

17:37.665 --> 17:40.146
-WHY CAN'T DAD UNDERSTAND IT?
-WE LIVED ON THE BEACH

17:40.276 --> 17:42.670
THE ENTIRE TIME
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP.

17:42.800 --> 17:47.327
IT WAS SOMEPLACE THAT HE VISITED
WHEN HE WASN'T WORKING.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.634
YEAH, HE NEVER LOVED IT
LIKE YOU DO.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.595
-YEAH, WELL, SOMETIMES,
I THINK HE NEVER LOVED ME.

17:54.725 --> 17:57.902
-DON'T YOU DARE TALK
ABOUT YOUR FATHER THAT WAY.

17:58.033 --> 18:01.689
HE LOVES YOU DEEPLY.
I GUESS IT'S HARD
FOR HIM TO SHOW IT

18:01.819 --> 18:04.083
AS IT IS FOR YOU
TO RECOGNIZE IT
WHEN HE DOES.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.783
-I KNOW. I RECOGNIZE IT.
I'M SORRY, MOM.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.480
IT'S JUST THAT...

18:11.264 --> 18:13.179
I MEAN, I KNOW HE LOVES ME.

18:14.789 --> 18:18.314
WHY DOES HE WANT ME
TO TAKE OVER A BUSINESS
THAT'S NOT GONNA MAKE ME HAPPY?

18:19.968 --> 18:21.100
-BECAUSE...

18:23.319 --> 18:25.756
IT'S THE ONLY THING
HE HAS TO LEAVE YOU.

18:31.588 --> 18:34.417
-WHAT? MOM...

18:35.549 --> 18:39.074
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME?
-HE HAS LYMPHOMA, MITCH.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.730
-WELL, THAT'S TREATABLE,
ISN'T IT?

18:42.860 --> 18:47.604
-THEY'VE TRIED, BUT...
IT'S GONE BEYOND THAT NOW.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.261
-HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN, MOM?

18:53.784 --> 18:58.224
-A LITTLE OVER A YEAR.
-OVER A YEAR?
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

18:58.963 --> 19:02.576
-YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER.
HE WAS SO SURE HE WOULD BEAT IT.

19:03.490 --> 19:06.754
HE STARTED WORKING
ON THAT DESIGN
FOR THE UNIVERSITY COMPLEX

19:06.884 --> 19:08.408
THAT HE WAS ALWAYS
GOING ON ABOUT.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.498
HE WANTS THAT
TO BE HIS LEGACY.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.588
OF COURSE,
NOW HE REALIZES THAT...

19:14.892 --> 19:16.024
THAT HE CAN'T COMPLETE IT.

19:17.982 --> 19:21.421
THAT'S WHY HE WANTS YOU
TO FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS,

19:21.856 --> 19:24.467
