01:06.022 --> 01:07.554
              Eh?

01:11.359 --> 01:12.991
       What? Too daring?

01:12.993 --> 01:15.927
 Not if you're daring people
      to kick your ass.

01:15.929 --> 01:17.528
 It's called pea-cocking, bro.

01:17.530 --> 01:20.097
Alright, females are attracted
      to bright colours.

01:20.099 --> 01:20.864
           How's it--

01:20.866 --> 01:22.532
    How's it working so far?

01:22.534 --> 01:24.200
  You know, it's working well.

01:24.202 --> 01:25.334
      You've got to play
      to your strengths.

01:25.336 --> 01:27.235
       Style and charm,
    you know what I mean.

01:27.237 --> 01:28.603
   You should play to yours,

01:28.605 --> 01:30.171
     you should bust out
those panty dropping card tricks

01:30.173 --> 01:31.872
  that you never show anyone.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.707
 Girls don't like card tricks.

01:33.709 --> 01:35.208
        Are you kidding?

01:35.210 --> 01:36.108
       Of course they do.

01:36.110 --> 01:36.741
        No, they don't.

01:36.743 --> 01:38.008
         Yeah, they do.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.043
Dude. According to Men's Health

01:40.045 --> 01:43.046
    females are 18 percent
more likely to sleep with a guy

01:43.048 --> 01:45.681
   after seeing a card trick.

01:45.683 --> 01:46.281
            Really?

01:46.283 --> 01:47.248
             Yeah,

01:47.250 --> 01:49.216
     May 2010. Look it up.

01:49.218 --> 01:51.051
         Hey gorgeous.

01:51.053 --> 01:55.221
   Gorgeous, would you like
     to see a card trick?

01:55.223 --> 01:56.956
             Sure.

01:56.958 --> 02:01.026
      Alright, pick one
      and don't show me.

02:03.530 --> 02:05.630
        Now tear it up.

02:09.936 --> 02:11.302
     Can I have that back.

02:11.304 --> 02:13.437
        Give it to him.

02:17.809 --> 02:20.242
       Is this your card?

02:20.244 --> 02:23.311
      No, not even close.

02:24.247 --> 02:26.213
        Check your bra.

02:27.583 --> 02:29.082
             What?

02:29.084 --> 02:31.150
        Check your bra.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.090
       That's amazing,
     how did you do that?

02:39.092 --> 02:41.058
       I can't tell you.

02:41.060 --> 02:41.958
      She's coming back...

02:41.960 --> 02:43.926
    Oh my god, it's working!

02:43.928 --> 02:47.795
  Listen, I'm having a party
  at my house next weekend.

02:47.797 --> 02:50.330
        You should come.

02:50.332 --> 02:52.465
      That sounds amazing,

02:52.467 --> 02:55.000
      but I've got this
      church thing so...

02:55.002 --> 02:57.335
         Church thing.

02:57.337 --> 02:59.437
        Church thing...

02:59.439 --> 03:00.571
      No, no, no, no, no.

03:00.573 --> 03:02.406
   Neil just gets exhausted
        after a show,

03:02.408 --> 03:06.309
    you've got to give him
           a break.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.076
         [bell ringing]

03:07.078 --> 03:08.343
             What?

03:08.345 --> 03:10.978
 What the hell was that, man,
           church?

03:10.980 --> 03:12.813
You're supposed to try to get
   in her pants, you know,

03:12.815 --> 03:14.247
        not convert her.

03:14.249 --> 03:15.915
       I know, I blew it.

03:15.917 --> 03:17.249
     You at least touched
          her boob.

03:17.251 --> 03:18.316
           I didn't.

03:18.318 --> 03:19.750
    Well, then how did you?

03:19.752 --> 03:21.918
         It was magic.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.086
  Are you magically touching
      a boob right now?

03:24.088 --> 03:26.254
 Hey Denise, he just totally
       felt up Cheryl.

03:26.256 --> 03:27.121
         Yeah, I know.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.422
       And so does Kent.

03:28.424 --> 03:30.090
      He's on a rampage,
 you'd better hide your ass.

03:30.092 --> 03:33.325
  Oh shit, oh shit, hurry up.

03:34.795 --> 03:36.361
           Over here.

03:36.363 --> 03:37.295
            Oh fuck.

03:37.297 --> 03:38.863
            Oh shit.

03:42.101 --> 03:43.767
            Oh shit.

03:49.307 --> 03:50.506
   Where is that little shit?

03:50.508 --> 03:53.775
         Uh, the, uh...

03:53.777 --> 03:55.276
             Neil!

03:55.278 --> 03:58.279
    Neil, yeah Neil is you
          know Neil.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.147
       He put a card in
     my girlfriends bra,

04:00.149 --> 04:01.948
I'm going to tear him in half
      like a phone book.

04:01.950 --> 04:06.218
       Open the door or
   I'll put you through it.

04:06.220 --> 04:08.520
         No, no, don't.

04:08.522 --> 04:09.821
 Uh, alright man just alright.

04:09.823 --> 04:14.658
          Matt, fuck.

04:14.660 --> 04:17.060
 What the fuck are you doing
          in there?

04:17.062 --> 04:18.361
        You jacking it?

04:18.363 --> 04:20.963
 Hey everyone, Neil's jerking
      off in the closet,

04:20.964 --> 04:22.731
        what a fucking
      gross little perv.

04:22.733 --> 04:24.232
              Eew!

04:24.234 --> 04:26.234
   Leave him alone, asshole.

04:26.236 --> 04:28.469
              Go.

04:28.471 --> 04:30.537
      Lets let him finish.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.355
    I don't know, wouldn't
  you rather be sleeping in

04:50.357 --> 04:51.856
        on the weekends?

04:51.858 --> 04:54.058
 It's only an hour a week and
 it makes our parents happy.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.693
    I fucking hate church,
           so lame.

04:56.695 --> 04:58.494
   Come on, put your robe on.

04:58.496 --> 05:00.362
          Wait, wait.

05:00.364 --> 05:02.897
       In Nomina Satanas.

05:02.899 --> 05:04.765
      (All):  Hail Satan!

05:04.767 --> 05:06.066
          Hail Satan.

05:06.068 --> 05:12.238
Hail Satan, and thank you Satan.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.273
            [slurps]

05:19.346 --> 05:21.579
     Brothers and sisters,

05:21.581 --> 05:24.448
as the celebration of Astaroth
          approaches

05:24.450 --> 05:29.919
 it is time to ask ourselves
   why do we worship Satan?

05:29.921 --> 05:32.855
  Is it for the power he has
         promised us?

05:32.857 --> 05:34.389
        Is it to be on
       the winning side

05:34.391 --> 05:37.458
     at the final battle
        of Armageddon?

05:37.460 --> 05:41.128
 The worship of Satan allows
       us to eat freely

05:41.130 --> 05:46.399
 from the tree of knowledge,
      of good and evil.

05:46.401 --> 05:50.936
   It gives us the freedom
    to indulge our senses

05:50.938 --> 05:57.241
  in the pleasures of Earth,
       Heaven and Hell.

05:57.243 --> 05:59.243
         Jesus Christ.

05:59.245 --> 06:00.711
         [whispers]
          Blasphemy!

06:00.713 --> 06:06.148
 If we could have everybody's
     undivided attention?

06:06.150 --> 06:09.217
           Thank you.

06:09.219 --> 06:10.318
          Where was I.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.319
         Side of truth.

06:11.321 --> 06:13.988
  Oh yes, brothers and sisters

06:13.990 --> 06:17.825
     the worship of Satan
   is all of these things.

06:17.827 --> 06:23.429
 But most of all it is to be
  on the side of the truth.

06:23.431 --> 06:26.398
     Let the scales fall
        from your eyes

06:26.400 --> 06:34.004
   for God is the deceiver
 and Satan is the salvation.

06:34.006 --> 06:38.774
   Soon we will perform the
   celebration of Astaroth,

06:38.776 --> 06:42.477
our young brother Neil will give
   himself over completely

06:42.479 --> 06:49.083
to our Lord to foil the accursed
      forces of Heaven.

06:49.085 --> 06:50.818
          Hail Satan!

06:50.820 --> 06:53.453
      <i> (All):  Hail Satan!</i>

06:53.455 --> 06:56.088
   Bring forth the offering.

06:56.090 --> 06:59.357
      [bah, bah, bah, bah]

06:59.359 --> 07:02.326
     Aw, look at the goat.

07:02.328 --> 07:07.363
     Lord, please accept
    this humble sacrifice.

07:07.365 --> 07:10.332
 I would totally trade places
  with that goat right now.

07:10.334 --> 07:11.533
    As a token of our faith.

07:11.535 --> 07:13.601
      Just keep watching.

07:13.603 --> 07:16.270
       In Nomina Satanas!

07:20.442 --> 07:22.608
 And remember, this Wednesday
   we're having a bake sale

07:22.610 --> 07:26.811
to raise money for our bowling
    team and also the star

07:26.813 --> 07:30.248
 of our upcoming celebration
    of Astaroth ceremony,

07:30.250 --> 07:32.984
       Neil, is working
     so hard to prepare.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.286
   Lets show him our support.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.887
           [applause]

07:36.889 --> 07:38.755
            Oh yeah.

07:38.757 --> 07:41.891
            Oh yeah.

07:41.893 --> 07:45.427
     Hey, so this talking
     during church thing.

07:45.429 --> 07:46.995
       Pretty fun, is it?

07:46.997 --> 07:48.997
       Mom, Dad, listen.

07:48.999 --> 07:50.164
      No, no, no, no, no.

07:50.166 --> 07:52.499
I can actually see how joking
         and laughing

07:52.501 --> 07:54.801
 and embarrassing your family
     you know instead of

07:54.803 --> 07:57.503
paying attention to the sermon
could be a little entertaining.

07:57.505 --> 07:58.804
    Matt totally started it.

07:58.806 --> 08:00.438
   Okay, it's always Matt's
          fault huh?

08:00.440 --> 08:02.606
      Yes, actually it is.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.674
 Are you going to go through
    the rest of your life

08:04.676 --> 08:06.842
 never taking responsibility
      for your actions?

08:06.844 --> 08:07.776
              Huh?

08:07.778 --> 08:08.743
             Yeah.

08:08.745 --> 08:10.544
           Oh really.

08:12.781 --> 08:16.115
  Sheldon, hi, we were just
talking about how sorry we are

08:16.117 --> 08:18.016
    for that interruption
      during the sermon.

08:18.018 --> 08:21.352
  I should certainly hope so.

08:21.354 --> 08:26.423
You understand that next time
it's quite a different story?

08:26.425 --> 08:27.757
            Yes sir.

08:27.759 --> 08:29.492
How are the preparations going?

08:29.494 --> 08:31.794
        Oh, he's ready.

08:31.796 --> 08:35.429
In fact, why don't you recite
for them the names of our Lord.

08:35.432 --> 08:40.768
         Yes, do tell.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.535
            Tell us.

08:42.538 --> 08:46.139
  Lucifer, Affamet, Beezelbub.

08:46.141 --> 08:49.175
       That's Beelzebub.

08:49.177 --> 08:54.246
  Beelzebub, Belial, Abbadon.

08:56.450 --> 08:59.150
  There are over 40 of them
          you know.

08:59.152 --> 09:03.154
     You should take time
        to learn them.

09:03.156 --> 09:07.224
There are such fabulous things
      in store for you.

09:11.362 --> 09:14.429
           Can I go?

09:18.400 --> 09:23.035
    We're all very excited
      for the ceremony.

09:23.037 --> 09:24.836
            So am I.

09:24.838 --> 09:28.072
         Should be fun.

09:31.644 --> 09:34.544
  So, you've kept him chaste?

09:34.546 --> 09:37.747
   Oh, that problem kind of
     took care of itself.

09:37.749 --> 09:39.381
    You know, I never got
         into trouble

09:39.383 --> 09:41.249
      until your family
     joined this church.

09:41.251 --> 09:42.883
   Yeah, and you never had
       any fun either.

09:42.885 --> 09:43.817
       Did you? Did you?

09:43.819 --> 09:46.085
          Get off me.

09:48.522 --> 09:49.721
    You know, I still just
       don't understand

09:49.723 --> 09:51.923
   this whole oath business.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.491
 Like, they made you lock up
          your dick

09:53.493 --> 09:55.593
while they're all getting it on.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.329
 That doesn't make any sense,
    it's not fucking fair.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.698
They're stealing the greatest
     part of your youth,

10:00.700 --> 10:03.701
  the hot steamy sexual part.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.203
     Why would you agree
  with something like that?

10:06.205 --> 10:07.837
     I'm not getting laid
 because I'm not allowed to,

10:07.839 --> 10:09.205
      what's your excuse?

10:09.207 --> 10:10.539
       Oh, I see, I see.

10:10.541 --> 10:12.507
     So, you're scared huh?

10:12.509 --> 10:13.541
        I'm not scared.

10:13.543 --> 10:14.742
            No, no?

10:14.744 --> 10:15.743
   You've got a little case
      of the vagaphobia.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.010
    I don't have vagaphobia.

10:17.012 --> 10:18.111
      Seriously though,
     you've just got to,

10:18.113 --> 10:19.378
     you've got to figure
      this shit out man.

10:19.380 --> 10:20.545
     Before it's too late.

10:20.547 --> 10:21.779
            Hey Dad.

10:21.781 --> 10:23.680
     Because really Neil,
   what we should be doing

10:23.682 --> 10:24.947
 is tripping over each others
         dicks to see

10:24.949 --> 10:28.549
 who can bag the most babes,
          you know?

10:28.551 --> 10:30.551
        Fuck something.

10:30.553 --> 10:32.819
           Anything.

10:33.588 --> 10:34.787
    <i> That kids got problems.</i>

10:34.789 --> 10:36.622
   <i> Yeah, and that problem</i>
           <i> is you.</i>

10:36.624 --> 10:38.357
           <i> Bye Neil!</i>

10:38.359 --> 10:39.958
 We just wanted to make sure
       that both of you

10:39.960 --> 10:42.593
  were spiritually prepared
 for what's going to happen.

10:42.595 --> 10:47.030
   Of course, it's a great
           honour.

10:47.032 --> 10:49.732
   It will all be over very
       quickly, right?

10:49.734 --> 10:52.735
     Oh, just as quick as
    I can make it my dear.

10:52.737 --> 10:54.303
    I can assure you that -

10:54.305 --> 10:58.774
 That the dagger plunges into
 the flesh swiftly, smoothly.

10:58.776 --> 11:00.542
     It sounds so painful.

11:00.544 --> 11:02.043
          No, no, no.

11:02.045 --> 11:04.578
  He'll feel a little pinch
but for no more than an instant.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.046
          So, no pain.

11:06.048 --> 11:07.480
    No, there will be pain.

11:07.482 --> 11:08.714
         Extreme pain.

11:08.716 --> 11:12.717
       And blood, lots
       and lots of it.

11:12.719 --> 11:15.086
         I'm so sorry.

11:15.088 --> 11:18.622
  As I was saying this whole
 process is not only painless

11:18.624 --> 11:19.756
         but euphoric.

11:19.758 --> 11:23.659
      I have a crazy idea.

11:23.661 --> 11:28.563
Why don't we just sit him down
and explain everything to him,

11:28.565 --> 11:30.298
  that way he'll be prepared.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.099
  What are you going to tell
          him, okay,

11:32.101 --> 11:34.734
that his best friend is going
    to have to mop him up

11:34.736 --> 11:36.268
      after the ceremony?

11:36.270 --> 11:37.769
      No. Shelly, come on.

11:37.771 --> 11:39.437
        He'll accept it.

11:39.439 --> 11:41.238
        He loves Satan.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.572
     Sheldon, I'm so sorry.

11:42.574 --> 11:45.174
     No, no, please please.

11:45.176 --> 11:50.478
 There's no reason to confuse
      the little fellow.

11:50.480 --> 11:54.114
      We don't have time
     for second thoughts.

11:54.116 --> 11:56.349
 If we don't perform the ritual

11:56.351 --> 11:58.818
      on the equinox of
        his 18th year

11:58.820 --> 12:02.754
 Jesus Christ will return and
  usher in a thousand years

12:02.756 --> 12:05.156
       of peace on Earth.

12:05.158 --> 12:08.125
     Is that what you want?

12:08.127 --> 12:11.161
              No.

12:11.163 --> 12:14.631
       I didn't think so.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.767
  So, my advice to you is to
  put your misgivings aside

12:17.769 --> 12:21.837
   and focus on the positive.

12:26.209 --> 12:28.342
             [horn]

12:28.344 --> 12:29.609
         Eat some cake.

12:29.611 --> 12:31.177
     Yeah, you should be
   enjoying your big night.

12:31.179 --> 12:32.011
             [horn]

12:32.013 --> 12:33.312
  Want some ice cream on that?

12:33.314 --> 12:36.815
  You should be eating like
     there's no tomorrow.

12:36.817 --> 12:38.049
       It's a clown, dad.

12:38.051 --> 12:39.116
            I'm 18.

12:39.118 --> 12:42.185
    Why don't you tell us
        what's wrong?

12:42.187 --> 12:44.554
         Is it a girl?

12:44.556 --> 12:47.623
              No.

12:49.860 --> 12:52.927
    Actually, yeah kind of.

12:54.630 --> 12:57.697
              Oh.

12:58.833 --> 13:01.233
     Did something happen?

13:01.235 --> 13:03.535
  I'm not going to bore you
      with the details.

13:03.537 --> 13:05.036
   You're going to look me
          in the eye

13:05.038 --> 13:06.570
  and you're going to answer
        me truthfully,

13:06.572 --> 13:08.471
          was there
    any physical contact?

13:08.473 --> 13:09.705
              No.

13:09.707 --> 13:11.540
 So, there was no intercourse?

13:11.542 --> 13:12.908
          Inter-- No.

13:12.910 --> 13:14.509
          And no oral?

13:14.511 --> 13:16.410
      Giving or receiving?

13:16.412 --> 13:17.377
              No.

13:17.379 --> 13:18.644
        What about anal?

13:18.646 --> 13:19.711
          Jesus, mom!

13:19.713 --> 13:21.379
     Answer your mother,
       was there anal?

13:21.381 --> 13:22.680
              No.

13:22.682 --> 13:24.915
    Okay, look, something
  happened that will ensure

13:24.917 --> 13:28.685
    I will never get laid
      in my whole life.

13:28.687 --> 13:31.688
Son, look, you know you can talk
    to me about anything.

13:31.690 --> 13:34.323
I didn't break my stupid oath,
           alright.

13:34.325 --> 13:37.225
        [sigh of relief]

13:37.227 --> 13:40.361
           Okay then.

13:40.363 --> 13:42.896
  The oath isn't stupid honey,

13:42.898 --> 13:45.665
    it's the whole reason
        you were born.

13:45.667 --> 13:48.334
   We were your age when I
    conceived and we just,

13:48.336 --> 13:51.603
  we didn't know what to do
     but Sheldon told us

13:51.605 --> 13:55.673
that you had a special purpose.

13:55.675 --> 13:57.775
    Look, I'm sure you're
        going through

13:57.777 --> 14:00.778
    some pretty depressing
   teenage stuff right now.

14:00.780 --> 14:03.914
 Been there, done that, even
 I had a stupid haircut once

14:03.916 --> 14:06.783
           didn't I?

14:06.785 --> 14:10.219
   But you are representing
  our family and our church,

14:10.221 --> 14:12.788
 when it is all over you will
 have a fuller understanding

14:12.790 --> 14:15.257
    of what it is all about.

14:15.259 --> 14:18.593
    I've got to take a leak.

14:22.531 --> 14:24.864
   Gary, we need to tell him.

14:24.866 --> 14:26.899
You know how he hates surprises,

14:26.901 --> 14:28.400
 if we just explain it to him.

14:28.402 --> 14:30.235
        Absolutely not!

14:30.237 --> 14:33.238
 He'll cause a scene, crying
  and kicking and screaming.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.040
   Do you want other people
         to see that?

14:36.042 --> 14:38.375
    Look, you heard , okay,

14:38.377 --> 14:41.745
    he has suffered enough
    humiliation, trust me.

14:41.747 --> 14:45.815
      We did not choose
       Neil's destiny.

14:46.717 --> 14:47.916
            He did.

14:47.918 --> 14:52.986
    [thunder and lightning]

14:52.988 --> 14:54.821

15:03.030 --> 15:04.696
     <i> Abbadon, Beelzebub...</i>

15:04.698 --> 15:07.331
  I want you to know that it
      won't just be Neil

15:07.333 --> 15:10.900
     who will be rewarded
      for his sacrifice.

15:10.902 --> 15:12.868
         To a new era.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.403
         To a new era.

15:15.405 --> 15:17.671
           Thank you.

15:17.673 --> 15:19.873
          [bell tolls]

15:19.875 --> 15:22.041
   It's almost sundown, dear.

15:22.043 --> 15:24.343
Oh, would you kindly excuse us?

15:24.345 --> 15:26.411
           Of course.

15:32.718 --> 15:34.850
         Good evening.

15:36.954 --> 15:39.520
         Good evening.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.189
   <i> Lucifer, Baphomet, Belial,</i>

15:43.191 --> 15:46.892
  <i> Abbadon, Beelzebub, Belial.</i>

15:46.894 --> 15:49.895
     I am so proud of you.

15:49.897 --> 15:51.563
            Thanks.

15:51.565 --> 15:54.599
  You've been such a good son.

16:12.050 --> 16:14.583
      There he is buddy,
             huh?

16:14.585 --> 16:16.785
        Man of the hour.

16:16.787 --> 16:18.787
     Listen, I heard that
    after the confirmation

16:18.789 --> 16:20.922
  you get to bone any woman
           you want

16:20.924 --> 16:23.591
 from within the congregation.

16:23.593 --> 16:24.925
If it were me I'd go for Colette

16:24.927 --> 16:26.826
    and make her boyfriend
        fucking watch.

16:26.828 --> 16:28.961
      Don't embarrass me.

16:28.963 --> 16:30.395
           Do I ever?

16:30.397 --> 16:31.829
        [bells ringing]

16:31.831 --> 16:34.898
       Okay everybody,
     time to get started.

16:54.785 --> 16:56.851
        Are you excited?

17:05.493 --> 17:07.527
     Brothers and sisters,

17:07.529 --> 17:11.097
   we are gathered together
   for an ancient ceremony.

17:11.098 --> 17:14.099
    Momentous and beautiful.

17:14.102 --> 17:18.002
 Before we begin please turn
     off your cell phones

17:18.005 --> 17:20.505
   and all other electronic
           devices.

17:20.507 --> 17:26.009
   [cells turning off sounds]

17:26.011 --> 17:30.813
 Eighteen years ago our Lord
     chose this young man

17:30.815 --> 17:34.850
    to join him in battle
 against the Great Deceiver.

17:34.852 --> 17:40.155
  His spirit will join with
  the Father on this night.

17:40.157 --> 17:41.990
     We now ask young Neil

17:41.992 --> 17:47.862
  to lay his earthly vessel
       upon our altar.

17:47.864 --> 17:51.932
    Handmaidens of our Lord.

18:04.179 --> 18:05.211
             Dude.

18:05.213 --> 18:07.179
       I think they're
      going to fuck you

18:07.181 --> 18:09.147
          right here
    in front of everyone.

       <i> In Nomina Satanas.</i>

18:14.220 --> 18:17.087
   Now the time approaches
    to release his spirit

18:17.089 --> 18:20.824
  into the arms of our father

18:20.826 --> 18:28.198
 whereupon his soul will join
  our King for all eternity.

18:28.200 --> 18:35.070
The sacrificial lamb will stand
    with Lucifer in Hades.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.072
 Whoa, whoa, sacrificial lamb?

18:37.074 --> 18:38.440
        It's a metaphor.

18:38.442 --> 18:41.342
    As we tear the virgins
        flesh asunder

18:41.344 --> 18:46.046
 so that the blood may spill
   forth in holy offering.

18:46.048 --> 18:49.682

19:08.298 --> 19:09.697
           After him!

19:13.902 --> 19:15.768
         Get back here!

19:15.770 --> 19:16.935
          Go, go, go!

       Move, move, move!

19:20.073 --> 19:22.273
        Okay, holy shit.

19:22.275 --> 19:23.674
            Come on.

19:33.251 --> 19:34.316
         Oh fuck!!!!!!!

19:50.233 --> 19:51.799
      Come here, quickly!

19:51.801 --> 19:53.000
            Come on.

19:53.002 --> 19:54.601
        Are they there?

19:54.603 --> 19:55.568
     Where's my other shoe?

19:55.570 --> 19:58.837
     Where's my other shoe?

28:23.721 --> 28:25.087
     We think he might be
       losing his mind

28:25.089 --> 28:27.589
we were just really worried so.

28:27.591 --> 28:30.158
Well, he was babbling nonsense.

28:30.160 --> 28:33.094
        So, you saw him?

28:33.096 --> 28:34.261
             Yeah.

28:34.263 --> 28:36.296
 Do you want to maybe tell us
        where he went?

28:36.298 --> 28:38.765
    Sorry, who are you guys?

28:38.767 --> 28:42.001
 Oh hi, I'm Brad and it would
      be really helpful

28:42.003 --> 28:44.869
 if you could help us find him.

28:46.772 --> 28:49.038
   Alright, uh yeah, come in.

28:52.676 --> 28:54.275
 How'd they know we were here?

28:54.277 --> 28:54.975
         I don't know.

28:54.977 --> 28:56.009
            Fucked!

28:56.011 --> 28:58.344
      Oh shit, shit, shit.

28:59.080 --> 28:59.611
   These pants are too tight.

28:59.613 --> 29:00.244
             Okay.

29:00.246 --> 29:01.111
          Ow, my nuts!

29:01.113 --> 29:03.246
Come on, come on. I've got you.

29:03.248 --> 29:03.980
            Lets go.

29:03.982 --> 29:05.081
              Go.

29:05.083 --> 29:06.782
   So, it's just down this
         street here

29:06.784 --> 29:10.652
 oh but it's a one way so you
should just go around via Oak

29:10.654 --> 29:13.721
  and Cheryl's house should
     just be right there.

29:18.961 --> 29:21.494
You've been incredibly helpful,
          thank you.

29:21.496 --> 29:23.496
  Yeah, how do you guys know
         Neal again?

29:23.498 --> 29:24.630
          From church.

29:24.632 --> 29:25.797
      What church is that?

29:25.799 --> 29:27.698
   You've never heard of it.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.766
       We worship Satan.

29:39.445 --> 29:40.943
             Fuck.

29:43.314 --> 29:46.081
    Dude, you have nothing
           to lose.

29:46.083 --> 29:50.718
   No, humiliation is worse
         than death.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.786
   You've never walked into
    a room where everybody

29:52.788 --> 29:54.154
   has seen you wearing jizz.

29:54.156 --> 29:58.157
        Ah, yes. I have.

29:58.159 --> 30:00.159
 I can't do it, I choose death.

30:00.161 --> 30:01.994
      No, no, no, no, no.

30:01.996 --> 30:03.161
     Wait, wait, wait okay.

30:03.163 --> 30:04.795
     Your parents almost
     killing you tonight

30:04.797 --> 30:07.063
  that's the best thing that
 could have happened to you.

30:07.065 --> 30:09.799
They lit a fire under your ass
     to go out there grab

30:09.801 --> 30:15.471
  life by the ears and make
sweet sweet love to his mouth.

30:15.473 --> 30:19.574
 Fuck, you're a selfish prick
        you know that?

30:19.576 --> 30:20.975
       How am I selfish?

30:20.977 --> 30:23.510
     Because this is your
      last chance, Neal.

30:23.512 --> 30:25.111
   If you don't go in there
     and bust your hymen

30:25.113 --> 30:26.745
    then you're a dead man.

30:26.747 --> 30:27.979
   And then that's on my head

30:27.981 --> 30:33.417
  and I can't live with that
      shit so fuck you.

30:33.419 --> 30:36.086
 I wouldn't want me dying to
 be a source of guilt for you

30:36.088 --> 30:38.421
          or anything.

30:38.423 --> 30:40.989
              Yes!

              Hey.

31:01.809 --> 31:03.875
  Oh, can I play one with you?

     Oh my god, that was
       the worst thing

    I've ever seen happen
         to anybody.

31:39.206 --> 31:42.273
        You need a shot.

         another one?

35:18.743 --> 35:20.809

36:06.018 --> 36:08.051
        Like my outfit?

36:08.053 --> 36:09.185
      It's really pretty.

36:09.187 --> 36:12.621
            Thanks.

36:12.623 --> 36:14.389
  Take the back of the knee,
            right,

36:14.391 --> 36:16.624
  it's surprisingly sensitive.

36:16.626 --> 36:19.426
   It can't always be about
        the clitoris.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.694
        Oh hey, you go
        to my church.

36:21.696 --> 36:22.695
       Oh, that's right.

36:22.697 --> 36:24.396
   It is so good to see you.

36:24.398 --> 36:26.264
     It's good to see you.

36:26.266 --> 36:27.732
       So, where's Neal?

36:27.734 --> 36:29.934
     Neal, Neal's amazing.

36:29.936 --> 36:31.035
         I know, right?

36:31.037 --> 36:32.536
          Where is he?

36:32.538 --> 36:35.038
       No, no, no, no,
     I'm not telling you.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.106
   You I'm not going to tell.

36:37.108 --> 36:39.741
        Please tell me?

36:39.743 --> 36:42.210
        Please? Please?

36:42.212 --> 36:43.611
            Tell me?

36:43.613 --> 36:45.813
    You smell like cinnamon.

36:45.815 --> 36:48.649
  Okay, okay, okay I'll tell
           you okay

36:48.651 --> 36:53.720
but you're a little late because
   he's already having sex.

37:01.796 --> 37:03.428
     So, what are you into?

37:03.430 --> 37:06.798
     Besides magic I like
         video games,

37:06.800 --> 37:08.166
 I kind of like the retro stuff

37:08.168 --> 37:11.435
      because it's more
     about the game play.

37:11.437 --> 37:14.671
      I meant like in bed.

37:14.673 --> 37:16.572
              Uh.

37:17.841 --> 37:21.008
     You want to fuck me,
          don't you?

37:21.010 --> 37:25.111
  That would be super helpful.

37:25.113 --> 37:26.278
             Yeah.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.078
          I mean yes.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.146
              Ok.

37:33.285 --> 37:36.753
             Neal?

37:36.755 --> 37:39.222
     Neal, are you up here?

37:42.327 --> 37:43.826
         Are you ready?

37:43.828 --> 37:45.261
          I think so.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.395
        You feel ready.

37:46.397 --> 37:48.029
         I feel ready.

37:51.401 --> 37:53.200
  This is not what it looks
            like!

37:53.202 --> 37:55.635
        Cheryl? Really?

37:55.637 --> 37:56.969
       I asked you first.

37:56.971 --> 37:58.637
 You know I just came to warn
    you that these people

37:58.639 --> 38:01.039
  from your church are coming.

38:01.041 --> 38:02.740
   Oh. Can we still do this?

38:02.742 --> 38:05.109
     You're kidding, right?

38:11.116 --> 38:12.915
         Oh shit, fuck.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.950
         Do something.

38:27.463 --> 38:28.795
        That was close.

38:28.797 --> 38:30.129
            Lets go.

38:30.131 --> 38:32.397
No, I'll stay here and buy you
          some time.

38:32.399 --> 38:33.264
     Denise, it's not safe.

38:33.266 --> 38:34.465
   They're not after me okay,

38:34.467 --> 38:36.667
   we'll catch up later and
      see what happens.

38:36.669 --> 38:38.168
    So, you believe me now?

38:38.170 --> 38:41.304
 Yes, I believe you're being
  hunted by a Satanic cult.

38:41.306 --> 38:42.905
              Go.

38:47.311 --> 38:48.810
       Did you see Neal?

38:48.812 --> 38:51.913
 Jesus, is every girl at this
party trying to get with him?

38:51.915 --> 38:53.281
          Where is he?

38:53.283 --> 38:54.415

39:07.859 --> 39:09.625
        Oh my god, hey!

39:09.627 --> 39:12.094
  You know, I was wondering
 where all the hot guys were.

39:12.096 --> 39:14.196
    What are you doing here?

39:18.768 --> 39:20.267
           [gagging]

39:20.269 --> 39:21.534
  Matt, come on we have to go.

39:21.536 --> 39:22.535
             What?

39:22.537 --> 39:24.370
     We have to go, get up.

39:24.372 --> 39:26.772
Wait, wait, wait, do I have puke
         in my teeth?

39:26.774 --> 39:28.106
      Where's your friend?

39:28.108 --> 39:28.840
              Who?

39:28.842 --> 39:30.541
             Neal?

39:30.543 --> 39:32.643
   Uh, did you try upstairs?

39:32.645 --> 39:34.378
             Yeah.

39:38.517 --> 39:41.451
   Oh, I've just got to sit
          for a sec.

39:41.453 --> 39:42.385
            Oooh!!!

39:46.990 --> 39:47.855
            Alright.

39:47.857 --> 39:49.623

39:49.625 --> 39:51.791
      You're all smiling.

39:54.495 --> 39:57.696
       Hey guys, wait,
     where are you going?

39:57.698 --> 39:59.230
   We're not stealing a car.

39:59.232 --> 40:01.498
    No, we're borrowing it.

40:01.500 --> 40:05.134

40:14.910 --> 40:18.478
 Oh hey, so this church is it
 like any regular church or?

40:18.480 --> 40:21.013
  No, it's the exact opposite.

40:21.015 --> 40:24.049
 Oh okay, so your altar boys
  molest your priests then?

40:24.051 --> 40:26.117
      I don't really know.

40:29.322 --> 40:30.187

 got to be responsible here.

    How the fuck did they
           find us?

41:05.045 --> 41:09.347
I'll tell you how, your friend
without benefits sold us out.

41:09.349 --> 41:10.614
            Denise?

41:10.616 --> 41:12.782
     No fucking way man,
  she helped us escape dude.

41:12.784 --> 41:14.049
          Aw, barely.

41:14.051 --> 41:15.250
  You don't know what you're
        talking about,

41:15.252 --> 41:16.551
      how about your dad?

41:16.553 --> 41:18.119
            The cop?

41:18.121 --> 41:19.954
I bet you 50 bucks he's got some
kind of tracking chip implanted

41:19.956 --> 41:21.789
      into your nut sack.

41:21.791 --> 41:24.525
 Listen, there are Satanists
     all over this town.

41:24.527 --> 41:25.792
   It could be anyone, okay?

41:25.794 --> 41:28.528
     It could be you know
  the fucking taxi drivers,

41:28.530 --> 41:33.265
   waitresses, cops, hobos,
      fucking baristas,

41:33.267 --> 41:36.935
dog groomers, fucking vegans,
    fucking hipsters man.

41:36.937 --> 41:38.703
  You're right, you're right,

41:38.705 --> 41:40.371
      we've got to keep
       our eyes peeled.

41:40.373 --> 41:45.242
Bottom line, the only people we
can trust are each other, okay?

41:45.244 --> 41:50.079
  Wait, what if you just lied.

41:50.081 --> 41:51.480
      How would they know?

41:51.482 --> 41:53.949
  They will know, my mom is
  a bloodhound for bullshit.

41:53.951 --> 41:56.117
What self respecting teenager
   doesn't know how to lie

41:56.119 --> 41:57.418
       to his own mother?

41:57.420 --> 42:00.320
 She can smell it on my breath.

42:00.322 --> 42:02.555
    Oh fuck, oh fuck, fuck.

42:05.425 --> 42:06.757
             What?

42:06.759 --> 42:08.558
         What's wrong?

42:08.560 --> 42:09.625
       We're out of gas.

42:15.165 --> 42:17.231
 Maybe the Satanists will be
too scared to follow us here.

42:27.609 --> 42:30.009
      It's one of those
       pre-paid deals.

42:30.011 --> 42:32.077
           I got it.

             What?

43:10.146 --> 43:12.212
    I'm going to pay for it.

43:16.784 --> 43:19.651
    Yo dude, what the fuck
         is all that?

43:19.653 --> 43:22.186
 Provisions, in case we have
      to go into hiding.

43:22.188 --> 43:24.555
   Yeah, hiding, about that.

43:24.557 --> 43:27.057
  I've been thinking hiding
 might not be the best idea,

43:27.059 --> 43:27.991
            I mean.

43:27.993 --> 43:29.792
        Okay, come on,
       get in the car.

43:29.794 --> 43:31.360
 No, no, no this might sound
      a little fucked up

43:31.362 --> 43:33.195
but if any of this shit is real

43:33.197 --> 43:38.033
  then getting me laid might
   actually save the world.

43:40.137 --> 43:42.237
       Get in the car,
           come on.

43:42.239 --> 43:44.305

      that's why this is

43:46.075 --> 43:47.474
     so fucking insane man.

43:47.476 --> 43:49.309
    That's like delusions
      of grandeur much?

43:49.311 --> 43:50.810

 is safe, you get that right?

     or any of that shit.

   parents, Sheldon, Mary,

     the freer you'll be,

    having a fucking blast

44:10.094 --> 44:13.361
     enjoying not one but
 two flavours of beef jerky.

44:13.363 --> 44:17.164
  It's no big deal because I
  know at the end of the day

44:17.166 --> 44:20.600
     the only asshole who
     is judging me is me.

44:20.602 --> 44:23.269
    You know why I'm here,
            right?

44:23.271 --> 44:25.104
 Because I'm your only friend.

44:25.106 --> 44:27.506
    Yes, that and because
      I want to be there

44:27.508 --> 44:33.211
for the first moment that your
  dick tastes vaginal glory.

44:33.213 --> 44:34.679
  You want to watch me have
             sex?

         Come on, man.

44:40.352 --> 44:42.118
           Be happy?

44:42.120 --> 44:43.853
    You just want to live
    vicariously through me

44:43.855 --> 44:45.754
      because you're not.

44:45.756 --> 44:47.589
           Not what?

44:47.591 --> 44:49.857
            Nothing.

44:49.859 --> 44:51.091
 Never mind, I didn't say that.

44:51.093 --> 44:52.292
              Oh.

44:52.294 --> 44:56.195
 Because I'm not cool enough
           for you?

44:56.197 --> 44:59.364
Because I'm just your tag-a-long
        friend, right?

44:59.366 --> 45:00.932
 And now all of a sudden that
      you're Mr. Popular

45:00.934 --> 45:03.601
      you can't hang out
    with a loser like me?

45:03.603 --> 45:04.535
        Did I say that?

45:04.537 --> 45:05.802
        Oh please, Neal.

45:05.804 --> 45:06.702
         Be my friend.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.571
      Here, take my jerky.

45:08.573 --> 45:09.705
   How much for a sleepover.

45:09.707 --> 45:10.872
   You want to hang out now?

45:10.874 --> 45:11.572
              Huh?

45:11.574 --> 45:12.406
        Take everything.

45:12.408 --> 45:13.140
             Stop.

45:13.142 --> 45:13.740
       Everything I have.

45:13.742 --> 45:16.709
          Stop. Stop.

45:16.711 --> 45:18.177
             Whoa.

45:18.179 --> 45:19.344
             What?

45:19.346 --> 45:21.813
   I can't believe I'm even
       suggesting this.

45:21.815 --> 45:23.881
             What?

45:23.883 --> 45:25.949

45:27.852 --> 45:28.884
          Prostitutes.

45:28.886 --> 45:30.552
          Prostitutes.

45:30.554 --> 45:32.420
          Prostitutes!

45:32.422 --> 45:36.690
          Prostitutes!

45:36.692 --> 45:37.857
           Fuck yeah.

45:37.859 --> 45:39.825
         Fuck yeah man.

45:45.665 --> 45:47.364
            Alright.

45:47.366 --> 45:49.432
         Keep looking.

45:52.103 --> 45:55.337
    It does not look good
         I'm afraid.

45:55.339 --> 45:57.539
    He'll show up Sheldon,
          trust me.

45:57.541 --> 46:00.341
  You don't have to fear me,
            Gary.

46:00.343 --> 46:02.109
       I'm on your side.

46:02.111 --> 46:06.613
    But you need to fear,
  what we all need to fear,

46:06.615 --> 46:08.448
       is our Lord below.

46:08.450 --> 46:13.352
   I'm merely an instrument
        of his wrath.

46:13.354 --> 46:15.520
    What Sheldon is trying
       to say is that -

46:15.522 --> 46:17.355
           Yes, Mary.

46:17.357 --> 46:21.525
     Explain to them what
      I'm trying to say.

46:21.527 --> 46:27.530
What Sheldon is trying to say
is that if Neal doesn't show up

46:27.532 --> 46:32.200
we're going to need to find some
kind of replacement offering.

46:32.202 --> 46:35.436
   Thank you for clarifying
           my dear.

46:37.039 --> 46:39.506
              Oh.

46:48.716 --> 46:50.282
        Oh, this is sad.

46:50.284 --> 46:52.550
We should be helping these women
     not exploiting them.

46:52.552 --> 46:56.120
   Hey, hey, hey, this was
     this was your idea.

46:56.122 --> 46:59.256
   I know I just thought it
would be less tragic somehow.

46:59.258 --> 47:03.059
   Stop, stop, stop, stop,
            stop.

47:03.061 --> 47:06.896
   Hey, you looking to make
     some real cash money

47:06.898 --> 47:10.966

     barely legal studs?

      Both of you looking?

47:15.471 --> 47:16.403
              No.

47:16.405 --> 47:17.904
           Yes, yes.

47:17.906 --> 47:21.907
           How much?

47:21.909 --> 47:24.409
     That depends on what
          you want.

47:24.411 --> 47:28.479
Uh, I just really need to lose
   my virginity tonight so.

47:36.788 --> 47:41.189
   Yeah, I can help you out.

47:41.191 --> 47:43.424
         But not here.

47:43.426 --> 47:46.293
    Meet me there and ask
         for Ashley.

47:46.295 --> 47:48.561
              Oh.

48:00.841 --> 48:01.973
          Is this it?

48:01.975 --> 48:06.943
          Yeah, yeah.

48:06.945 --> 48:10.446
        Can I help you?

48:10.448 --> 48:13.615
[whispers] Is this the house of
         ill repute?

48:13.617 --> 48:15.850
   You don't have to whisper.

48:15.852 --> 48:18.886
          Oh, oh okay.

48:18.888 --> 48:21.822
I'd like one prostitute please.

48:21.824 --> 48:22.823
            Alright.

48:22.825 --> 48:24.691
    What were you looking
         for exactly?

48:24.693 --> 48:26.826
  I'd like a good personality,

48:26.828 --> 48:31.062
    I'd like a cute laugh,

 I pick you up at your house
  with one perfect red rose

57:13.382 --> 57:15.715

          the beach

57:35.499 --> 57:37.332
      and I gather every
    bit of courage I have

57:37.334 --> 57:40.601
and tell you what I've always
          needed to.

57:42.338 --> 57:44.671

 That I've liked you since I
 was old enough to like girls

57:48.009 --> 57:52.510
 but I was terrified that if
     I made a move on you

57:52.512 --> 57:54.678
I would ruin it and screw it up

57:54.680 --> 57:57.280
     and you would never
      talk to me again.

58:06.424 --> 58:07.356

     Did you get it in her?

59:45.702 --> 59:48.502
       So? What happened?

59:48.504 --> 59:49.603
     Are you going to say
          anything?

59:49.605 --> 59:51.137
   Are you going to tell me
        what happened?

59:51.139 --> 59:51.804
    Alright, what happened.

59:51.806 --> 59:52.604
             Okay.

59:52.606 --> 59:54.839
   I told Denise I liked her,

59:54.841 --> 59:57.508
  she said she liked me back
       which was great

59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.477
   and then I came all over
       her fucking leg.

01:00:00.479 --> 01:00:02.545
             Happy?

01:00:02.547 --> 01:00:05.614
 That's awesome dude, shit if
you would have told her sooner

01:00:05.616 --> 01:00:08.550
 you could have been breaking
your oath all over the place.

01:00:08.552 --> 01:00:10.351
   We wouldn't even be here.

01:00:10.353 --> 01:00:12.286
 Oh, so this is my fault now
            Matt?

01:00:12.288 --> 01:00:12.886
             What?

01:00:12.888 --> 01:00:13.519
              No.

01:00:13.521 --> 01:00:14.386
        No, no, no, no.

01:00:14.388 --> 01:00:15.620
        I'm just saying.

01:00:15.622 --> 01:00:16.721
    Oh, you're just saying.

01:00:16.723 --> 01:00:19.390
    Good, okay good you're
         just saying.

01:00:19.392 --> 01:00:22.459
 Ah, okay well what I'm saying

01:00:22.461 --> 01:00:25.528
is that you've made this whole
       night about you.

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:27.663
I was the one who was supposed
     to get laid tonight,

01:00:27.665 --> 01:00:31.500
     you got in line and
you were the one who had sex.

01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:34.135
 Yeah, I had sex with a dirty
          hoe okay,

01:00:34.137 --> 01:00:36.237
  what you have with Denise
       that's special,

01:00:36.239 --> 01:00:37.905
      that's that's nice.

01:00:37.907 --> 01:00:39.406
         Fuck you, man.

01:00:39.408 --> 01:00:40.840
            Fuck me?

01:00:40.842 --> 01:00:43.375
  It's too late, there's no
  more me and Denise, dude.

01:00:43.377 --> 01:00:44.642
I'm not going to school again,
            dude,

01:00:44.644 --> 01:00:46.377
  I'm dead like fucking dead.

01:00:46.379 --> 01:00:47.544
       Dead, dead, dead.

01:00:47.546 --> 01:00:49.546
   You're not dead yet okay,

01:00:49.548 --> 01:00:51.915
   you still-- we can still
       get out of here

01:00:51.917 --> 01:00:53.349
  and don't blame me for this.

01:00:53.351 --> 01:00:55.584
  How am I going to get out,
  my hands are fucking tied.

01:00:55.586 --> 01:00:56.518
       My hands are tied!

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.587
     My hands are tied too.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.723
     Did you just kick me?

01:01:07.462 --> 01:01:08.461
     Did you just fucking
           kick me?

01:01:08.463 --> 01:01:09.962
   Yeah I fucking kicked you.

01:01:09.964 --> 01:01:10.929
    What are you doing, man?

01:01:10.931 --> 01:01:11.963
  You fucking kicked me first.

01:01:11.965 --> 01:01:13.764
      When you kicked me
       it fucking hurt.

01:01:13.766 --> 01:01:14.865
 <i> Hey, shut the fuck up back</i>
           <i> there.</i>

01:01:14.867 --> 01:01:17.000
   No, you shut the fuck up
             man.

01:01:17.002 --> 01:01:19.302
         Fuck you, man.

01:01:19.304 --> 01:01:20.303
             Fuck.

01:01:20.305 --> 01:01:23.306
      [struggling grunts]

01:01:23.308 --> 01:01:24.573
      Want to fucking go?

01:01:31.281 --> 01:01:32.680
          Don't even.

01:01:32.682 --> 01:01:35.816
       Ah, there you are.

01:01:35.818 --> 01:01:40.153
     You are more trouble
      than you're worth.

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:43.222
 And you have kept us waiting.

01:01:43.224 --> 01:01:45.023
  Well, I've got to hand it
         to you Neal,

01:01:45.025 --> 01:01:49.493
you continually find new ways
  to humiliate your family.

01:01:49.495 --> 01:01:52.295
    I'm the embarrassment,
       really Dad, me?

01:01:52.297 --> 01:01:53.062
     I'm the embarrassment?

01:01:53.064 --> 01:01:55.531
   Yeah, that's right buster.

01:01:55.533 --> 01:01:58.734
   This stupid religion has
fucked with your heads so bad

01:01:58.736 --> 01:02:00.335
   you're actually willing
         to sacrifice

01:02:00.337 --> 01:02:01.636
    your own flesh and blood

01:02:01.638 --> 01:02:04.005
       for some red guy
         with a tail.

01:02:04.007 --> 01:02:06.007
      Whoa, whoa, whoa,
  that's where you go easy.

01:02:06.009 --> 01:02:08.476
    You worship a fucking
      Halloween costume.

01:02:08.478 --> 01:02:09.410
             Yeah.

01:02:09.412 --> 01:02:10.911
            Shut up.

01:02:10.913 --> 01:02:13.914
     You dragged Mom down
    with you, look at her,

01:02:13.916 --> 01:02:16.249
   does she look okay to you?

01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:19.685
   I'm not the embarrassment.

01:02:19.687 --> 01:02:22.320
        How very sweet.

01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:26.757
 I wish we had more time for
such touching family reunions

01:02:26.759 --> 01:02:29.526
      but alas we do not.

01:02:29.528 --> 01:02:31.694
        Get them ready.

01:02:31.696 --> 01:02:34.596
  Everything is going to be
          okay now.

01:02:43.039 --> 01:02:44.671
         [goat sounds]

01:02:54.749 --> 01:02:58.750
 Real nice, real fucking nice.

01:02:58.752 --> 01:03:00.551
         Your own son?

01:03:00.553 --> 01:03:02.352
        You're gutless.

01:03:14.899 --> 01:03:18.700
             Neal.

01:03:18.702 --> 01:03:20.702
         Come on, Neal.

01:03:20.704 --> 01:03:22.770
       Don't talk to me.

01:03:34.883 --> 01:03:38.551
            I cried.

01:03:38.553 --> 01:03:40.986
             What?

01:03:40.988 --> 01:03:43.321
            I cried.

01:03:43.323 --> 01:03:44.655
      What are you saying?

01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:45.622
  What do you mean you cried?

01:03:45.624 --> 01:03:47.090
  What are you talking about?

01:03:47.092 --> 01:03:50.559
   I lost my virginity to a
prostitute tonight and I cried.

01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:54.295
         [goat sounds]

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:58.732
         Yeah, alright.

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:02.268
  I don't know what happened
     man, I just lost it.

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:04.837
       I mean, I had it
    but then I don't know

01:04:04.839 --> 01:04:09.941
    something just snapped
         and I just.

01:04:09.943 --> 01:04:11.943
Well, at least you didn't come
         on her leg.

01:04:11.945 --> 01:04:13.444
       Right on the leg?

01:04:13.446 --> 01:04:14.978
       The leg, the seat.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:17.046
   It's fucking embarrassing.

01:04:19.283 --> 01:04:21.249
   Come here man, come here.

01:04:21.251 --> 01:04:23.184
       I'm sorry dude,
        I'm sorry man.

01:04:23.186 --> 01:04:24.785
   Come here, come here man.

01:04:24.787 --> 01:04:26.787
I'm sorry man, this whole night
 has been so fucked up dude.

01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:29.856
          No, no, no.

01:04:29.858 --> 01:04:31.824
         This is nice.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.892
         I needed this.

01:04:36.763 --> 01:04:39.463
    Well, this is it buddy.

01:04:39.465 --> 01:04:44.167
  Wait, there still might be
      a way out of this.

01:04:44.169 --> 01:04:45.201
        No, there isn't.

01:04:45.203 --> 01:04:46.669
       No, no, no, stop.

01:04:46.671 --> 01:04:48.971
 Just stop being so at peace
     with everything okay

01:04:48.973 --> 01:04:50.772
   just listen to me here,
       hear me out okay

01:04:50.774 --> 01:04:54.142
I'm not going to give up on you.

01:04:54.144 --> 01:04:57.011
  When does a guys virginity
      really end, right?

01:04:57.013 --> 01:05:01.682
   It's when he penetrates
something with his erect penis.

01:05:01.684 --> 01:05:03.817
             Right.

01:05:03.819 --> 01:05:06.052
    Who says it has to be
          a vagina.

01:05:06.054 --> 01:05:07.319
         [goat sounds]

01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:08.887
           Oh god no.

01:05:08.889 --> 01:05:14.058
No, no, no, I'm telling you dude
if it's going to save your life

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.159
      you've got to do me.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:16.660
       I can't, I can't.

01:05:16.662 --> 01:05:18.028
          You have to.

01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:19.662
Are you saying that you couldn't
    fuck your best friend

01:05:19.664 --> 01:05:20.796
     to save your own life?

01:05:20.798 --> 01:05:21.997
  Is that what you're saying?

01:05:21.999 --> 01:05:23.631
I'm just not sure the equipment
         would work.

01:05:23.633 --> 01:05:26.800
Be totally mean right now okay,
   just, I'm at least an 8.

01:05:26.802 --> 01:05:27.901
     Even if you were a 10.

01:05:27.903 --> 01:05:31.237
   I'm just saying how hard
         could it be?

01:05:37.077 --> 01:05:37.809
         Give me a sec.

01:05:37.811 --> 01:05:41.411
    Okay, yeah, just think.

01:05:41.413 --> 01:05:42.044
        Okay, I'll try.

01:05:42.046 --> 01:05:43.245
             What?

01:05:43.247 --> 01:05:44.512
        I mean, really?

01:05:44.514 --> 01:05:45.145
             Yeah.

01:05:45.147 --> 01:05:46.012
          Okay, yeah.

01:05:46.014 --> 01:05:46.912
 I mean, I want to live right.

01:05:46.914 --> 01:05:49.147
       Yeah, I want you
         to live man.

01:05:51.518 --> 01:05:53.251
     Whoa, whoa, what are
          you doing?

01:05:53.253 --> 01:05:54.085
         What was that?

01:05:54.087 --> 01:05:55.352
    Sorry, I thought maybe.

01:05:55.354 --> 01:05:56.686
        No extras man,
           no time.

01:05:56.688 --> 01:05:57.653
      No time for extras.

01:05:57.655 --> 01:05:59.054
  Lets just, we've just got
            to go.

01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:00.088
        How do we start?

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:03.991
       Uh, uh, come here.

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:11.097
 Just, just alright, you know.

01:06:11.099 --> 01:06:13.566
      Oh fuck, oh my god.

01:06:13.568 --> 01:06:16.535
 You're my best friend, man,
    you're my best friend.

01:06:16.537 --> 01:06:18.837
          Best friend.

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:25.910
    So, what are we going
       to do with her?

01:06:25.912 --> 01:06:27.378
  You stay here and watch her.

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.546
   But no, I want to watch
 the sacrifice you said that.

01:06:29.548 --> 01:06:31.681
     That's enough Bradley.

01:06:34.185 --> 01:06:35.918
           Oh my god.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.020
       She talks to you
     like you're a child.

01:06:38.022 --> 01:06:40.922
   I am not allowed to talk
       to you anymore.

01:06:40.924 --> 01:06:43.024
         Come on Brad.

01:06:43.026 --> 01:06:47.627
  You're this smart, sexy guy

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:51.863
      and with your arms
     and abs, this chest

01:06:51.865 --> 01:06:57.034
 I mean girls must be hitting
     on you all the time.

01:06:57.036 --> 01:06:59.469
It is hard to find single women
       in this church.

01:06:59.471 --> 01:07:03.238
 Well, as a single woman how
  would I go about becoming

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.273
      part of the church?

01:07:05.275 --> 01:07:06.874
 You've got to renounce God,
        get a tattoo,

01:07:06.876 --> 01:07:08.976
    take a whiz on a bible.

01:07:08.978 --> 01:07:12.145
      It's a whole thing.

01:07:12.147 --> 01:07:13.880
 You know, if you really want
       to go out there

01:07:13.882 --> 01:07:16.048
      you should just go.

01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:17.949
  Yeah, I know I just can't
 because I have to stay here

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:22.453
        and babysit you.

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:24.321
     I think I'll be fine.

01:07:35.267 --> 01:07:36.499
  What's going on back there?

01:07:36.501 --> 01:07:37.800
         I'm not hard.

01:07:37.802 --> 01:07:40.569
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going
      to blow you dude.

01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:41.903
 I didn't ask you to blow me,
            Matt.

01:07:41.905 --> 01:07:44.472
  I know, it's just just get
       it in you know.

01:07:44.474 --> 01:07:46.006
            Oh god.

01:07:46.008 --> 01:07:48.074
    Oh shit, we were just,
         hi, hi Dad.

01:07:48.076 --> 01:07:50.743
     Alright, break it up.

01:07:50.745 --> 01:07:54.346
           It's time.

01:07:54.348 --> 01:07:56.648
   Hey, there's no judgement.

01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:57.949
  I fucked a lady prostitute.

01:07:57.951 --> 01:08:00.851
      A lady prostitute
       and she was hot.

01:08:00.853 --> 01:08:02.319
    Few hours ago, real hot.

01:08:02.321 --> 01:08:04.254
 Like, you want to get to him
  you got to go through me.

01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:06.555
          Oh, alright.

01:08:10.427 --> 01:08:11.292
          Whoa, Neal.

01:08:11.294 --> 01:08:12.126
      It's all good, man.

01:08:12.128 --> 01:08:14.194
          Neal. Neal.

01:08:17.966 --> 01:08:21.434
     I'm right here man,
    I'm right beside you.

01:08:21.435 --> 01:08:24.103
       In Nomina Satanas,

01:08:24.104 --> 01:08:26.971
[chanting]  In Nomina Satanas...

01:08:26.974 --> 01:08:29.674
[chanting]  In Nomina Satanas...

01:08:29.676 --> 01:08:32.143
          Satanas Rex.

01:08:32.145 --> 01:08:34.712
      (All): Satanas Rex.

01:08:34.714 --> 01:08:39.215
      I invoke his power
       by these names.

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:47.288
      Belial, Baphomet,
     Beelzebub, Lucifer,

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:49.124
         Awful Monster.

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:51.326
        Skip the names.

01:08:51.328 --> 01:08:52.493
  What are you talking about?

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:53.895
    We can't skip the names.

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:55.162
      It's almost sunrise.

01:08:55.163 --> 01:08:56.462
    I know what time it is,

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:58.131
   I've got a bloody watch
          you know.

01:08:58.133 --> 01:09:00.299
   Then you know it's time
      to get on with it.

01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:02.234
     If you can do better
  why don't you do it then,

01:09:02.236 --> 01:09:03.100
     go on take the knife.

01:09:03.103 --> 01:09:03.968
          No, no, no.

01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:05.569
  Take the book, take my robe,

01:09:05.571 --> 01:09:08.138
       I'm so sorry for
      this interruption.

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:11.140
 No one cares about the names
        for fuck sake.

01:09:11.143 --> 01:09:14.277
       Alright, alright.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:17.647
      In Nomina Satanas...

01:09:17.649 --> 01:09:23.151
  Lord, we offer this virgin
        flesh unto you

01:09:23.153 --> 01:09:27.488
  that you may draw strength
 from the blood of innocence.

01:09:30.526 --> 01:09:33.859
 For the glory of your kingdom.

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:41.700
        I'm sorry, Neal.

01:09:41.702 --> 01:09:43.501
      [Continued Chanting]

01:09:43.502 --> 01:09:46.303
        In Nomina Sat--

01:09:46.305 --> 01:09:48.104

        in the flames!

01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:02.183
       In Nomina Satanas.

01:10:02.185 --> 01:10:03.317
             Gary!

01:10:03.319 --> 01:10:05.652
     Ow, ow, Satan burned
           my hand!

01:10:05.654 --> 01:10:07.854
     No, the curtains are
           on fire.

01:10:07.856 --> 01:10:10.223
         Ow my hand,

01:10:10.225 --> 01:10:12.625

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.862

01:10:28.406 --> 01:10:30.072
             Back!

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:43.817
              No!

01:10:54.762 --> 01:10:57.395
              No!

01:11:02.435 --> 01:11:04.568

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:08.238
      Aw, I love you man!

01:11:36.367 --> 01:11:39.301
  Alright, is this your card?

01:11:39.303 --> 01:11:41.202
              No.

01:11:41.204 --> 01:11:42.803
     Do I check my bra now?

01:11:42.805 --> 01:11:46.606
  Well, I could check for you.

01:11:46.608 --> 01:11:48.274
             What?

01:11:48.276 --> 01:11:49.975
   Oh my god, that's amazing.

01:11:49.977 --> 01:11:53.244
It will make you an all powerful
       video game god.

01:11:53.246 --> 01:11:55.279
  I've been looking for this
   online for like months.

01:11:55.281 --> 01:11:56.546
      How did you find it?

01:11:56.548 --> 01:11:58.247
   One of my birthday party
    clients hooked it up,

01:11:58.249 --> 01:12:00.249
     I did an extra hour
     for his 5 year old.

01:12:00.251 --> 01:12:01.250
          Aw, awesome.

01:12:01.252 --> 01:12:04.219
          Yeah, magic.

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:13.393
You missed a wonderful service.

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.460
        We're good, mom.

01:12:14.462 --> 01:12:19.264
     Honey, just remember
       Jesus loves you.

01:12:19.266 --> 01:12:21.332
     He died for your sins.

01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:26.937
       Give me the keys.

01:12:26.939 --> 01:12:28.838
      I'm going to drive.

01:12:34.078 --> 01:12:35.310
             Matt?

01:12:35.312 --> 01:12:38.746
       Guys, oh Shelly

01:12:38.748 --> 01:12:41.949
   Oh, you're so sweet Matt.

01:12:41.951 --> 01:12:43.483
     Maybe going to grab
         some vegan,

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:46.419
          Cool, cool.

01:12:46.421 --> 01:12:47.686
     I mean, I'd tell you
        to come along.

01:12:47.688 --> 01:12:48.687
        No, no, no, no.

01:12:48.689 --> 01:12:53.024
 I'm fine, I've got my Bible
            study,

01:12:55.328 --> 01:12:56.260
            Alright.

01:12:56.262 --> 01:12:57.995
            Alright.

01:13:02.967 --> 01:13:04.433
      Is that all you ate?

01:13:04.435 --> 01:13:08.470
      You had one crepe,
      you're ridiculous.

01:13:08.472 --> 01:13:10.605
          Ridiculous.

01:13:15.644 --> 01:13:17.610
    Could you put on that
   Christian rock station?

01:13:17.612 --> 01:13:18.544
             Sure.

01:13:18.546 --> 01:13:28.754
