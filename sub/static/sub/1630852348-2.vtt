NARRATOR: <i>I'm no help</i>
<i>when it comes to engines,</i>

00:42.292 --> 00:43.835

03:11.774 --> 03:14.068
Benny and Amirah,
what is expected of them?

03:14.152 --> 03:17.322
I want to see what techniques
you are going to use in your design

03:17.447 --> 03:20.658
and how well-executed
these techniques are going to be.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.785
I will be looking for creativity.

03:23.119 --> 03:28.458
How creative you get with your materials

04:08.081 --> 04:10.917
...we're gonna build a spaceship
for the Rebel mechanic.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.920
So, we're gonna pattern it
from the Millennium Falcon,

04:14.003 --> 04:15.338

-sugar dome.
-Yeah!

-Do a sugar dome. Yeah.
-Made out of sugar. It's clear,

04:26.140 --> 04:28.059
You know, we are from an Asian background,

04:28.142 --> 04:30.186
so we want to definitely add, like,
some Asian ingredients.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.647

of the Philippines.

<i>in a small town in Guangdong,</i>
<i>and I came here when I was five years old.</i>

04:43.116 --> 04:45.410
The fact that we're Asian,
we're very proud to be Asians.

04:45.493 --> 04:48.121
The fact that we actually
made it in America, like, we are living

-the Disney dream. You know what I mean?
-Exactly.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.041
But, I also wanna add,
like, different kind of elements.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.210

all the nature stuff,

a little bit about the concept
that you wanted to bring to life?

ANA: The majority of the spaceship
will be out of cake.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.157
Yep. And we're gonna feature a sugar dome
in the center.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.118

and then build it from there.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.453

-Yup.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.705

-Sugar is scary.
-It will break easily.

-Yep, definitely.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.131

05:40.214 --> 05:41.799
-Yes.
-We have those letter wing ships, right?

-Right, right. X-wing, Y-wing. V-wing.

After the Battle of Endor,
we have all those pieces

05:49.474 --> 05:51.642
from X-wing and the Y-wing
that fell out of sky,

05:51.768 --> 05:53.728
and then we're gonna
put those all together...

-...and refurbish it into our ship.

is actually pretty small.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.236

<i>because we are individual fans,</i>
<i>actually, of each other.</i>

06:06.032 --> 06:09.160

our astromech, that's our R2 droid.

<i>And I've watched</i>
<i>all of the </i>Star Wars<i> movies many times.</i>

06:21.005 --> 06:23.007
So, I'm very familiar
with all of the characters

06:23.091 --> 06:25.218

are supposed to look like.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.886

06:27.053 --> 06:28.513
-to create this?
-This is the canopy, right?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.598
We have to be able to see in there.
We want to see the pilot.

06:30.681 --> 06:31.933
-Correct.
-JENNA: <i>So I'm gonna attempt</i>

06:32.058 --> 06:34.185
<i>to make this entire canopy</i>
<i>out of gelatin.</i>

06:35.186 --> 06:36.979
Have you guys ever done this before?

06:37.105 --> 06:38.147
-Anything... No?
-No.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.608
And we just thought, visually, like,
if we can pull this off

06:40.691 --> 06:42.860
and it's clear and see-through,
and you can see the pilot inside,

06:43.027 --> 06:44.821
-like, it would just look stunning.
-Yeah.

06:44.946 --> 06:48.825
Go big. Give it your all. And we...
We wish you guys the best of luck.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.577
-Thank you. So nice to meet you.
-All right. See you guys later.

OBA: The Rebel mechanic has asked us

06:54.789 --> 06:57.125
to make a ship
to help with the Rebel fleet.

06:57.208 --> 07:01.003
Why not make a humongous ship
that's like a cargo ship,

07:01.254 --> 07:03.256
and we put smaller ships inside the ship

07:03.339 --> 07:05.216
and the carrier that will open
in the back?

07:05.299 --> 07:08.010
So what we're trying to do is,
we're trying to save the day, right?

07:08.094 --> 07:11.556
So, we gotta have something
with, um, like, a big weapon.

everybody's gonna be using cake.

07:19.772 --> 07:20.773

07:21.065 --> 07:22.567
We could use isomalt,

07:22.650 --> 07:26.070
<i>which is like, when you eat a lollipop,</i>
<i>that hard texture.</i>

07:26.654 --> 07:29.198
<i>'Cause in gingerbread,</i>
<i>we can just make panels</i>

like, wood work.

DUSTIN: <i>We each have our own</i>
<i>individual skill sets.</i>

07:47.925 --> 07:50.219
And I think part of our strategy to win

07:50.344 --> 07:52.096
is using those different techniques.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.724
What if we did an eight-foot-long ship?

of gingerbread panels.

at least 20 minutes per round.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.176
We were just really brainstorming

10:35.259 --> 10:37.928
and thinking about
what will give most color,

10:38.012 --> 10:40.765
<i>and every time we eat beets,</i>
<i>it always kind of stains everything.</i>

10:40.848 --> 10:43.309

<i>'cause it's so rich in color.</i>

10:44.185 --> 10:47.438
LIU: So, we have some golden beets here
and we actually have some red beets here.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.315
And then, right now,
we have rice noodles

10:49.398 --> 10:52.068
soaking so they can really get
the rich yellow color.

10:52.234 --> 10:56.072

But, it will give us the ombré effect of,

10:56.155 --> 10:57.573
<i>like, the yellow, orange, and red.</i>

10:57.782 --> 11:00.201
And then, maybe we can go ahead
and throw some of the graham crackers.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.036
NIKO: With the graham crackers
to give texture.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.996
-LIU: Yeah, definitely.
-And we can actually

11:04.121 --> 11:07.875

I'm gonna go grab that right now.

So, tell me what this process is
that you guys are doing and why?

11:34.485 --> 11:36.362
So, we are basically texturing it,

13:03.407 --> 13:04.909
This structure that I'm making right now

13:05.034 --> 13:08.412
is essentially a liner
for our canopy mold.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.915
<i>So this is going to go inside</i>
<i>of the foam core,</i>

13:11.123 --> 13:12.458
<i>which is gonna hold it tight.</i>

13:12.750 --> 13:15.336

<i>from leaking. Ideally.</i>

13:15.461 --> 13:19.715
I'm blooming the gelatin,
I'm gonna get the water boiling in a sec.

13:19.882 --> 13:25.513
JENNA: <i>So, this is a massive mold.</i>
<i>It's near 11 or 12 liters of gelatin,</i>

AMIRAH: <i>What they're doing,</i>

I came here to see food.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.064

-Well, I know it might be difficult.

All right, you guys it looks like

28:30.166 --> 28:32.377
Yavin Prime is dipping closer
to the horizon.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.379
-Which means time is running out.
-Hurry!

28:35.463 --> 28:37.424
I've never done this
so fast before in my life. Oh, my God.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.300
The vines, let's put the vines on.
Where are the vines?

28:39.426 --> 28:40.927
-They're right there.
-Oh, come on.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.470
-Dustin, can you move?
-Right there.

28:42.595 --> 28:45.890
DUSTIN: Yeah, you just tell me when.
Now? (CHUCKLES)

28:46.015 --> 28:48.309
Oh, my God. Well, that's the moving part.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.770
Okay, I got the lights. Okay, okay.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.357
-Don't drop it. Don't drop it, please.
-Yup.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.861
-This is it, everyone.
-Quickly, quickly.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.321

-MIKO: Yes.

29:03.533 --> 29:04.868
-KEKE: Two!
-LIU: Miko, you almost done?

29:05.076 --> 29:06.244
-Okay, we got this,...
-You got it?

29:06.369 --> 29:07.746
-...we got this, we got this.
-One!

29:09.205 --> 29:13.793

which means time is up.

I'm not that tall.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.321
(BEEPING)

29:41.905 --> 29:46.743
Today, all of you had to
answer the call of the Rebellion,

29:47.035 --> 29:49.913
and you all far exceeded expectations.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.499
It's time to show us what you've got.

29:52.832 --> 29:55.919
Pink Pandas, please step up.

29:57.754 --> 30:01.549
Pink Pandas, how are you feeling?
What are your thoughts now,

30:01.674 --> 30:03.468
you know, seeing the foodscape done?

30:03.635 --> 30:07.388
We feel so relieved,
but at the same time sad that it's over.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.599
'Cause we enjoyed working with each other.

30:09.724 --> 30:12.894
So, walk me through the story
of your foodscape.

30:13.102 --> 30:17.607
(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

30:18.149 --> 30:22.487
So, the story behind our foodscape
is that we are from the planet Adnap.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.824
<i>And we have sent</i>
<i>our most powerful spaceship</i>

30:25.949 --> 30:29.452
<i>to help the Rebel Mechanics</i>
<i>in their fight against the Empire.</i>

30:29.744 --> 30:31.871
On the left side,
that's a Chinese character

30:31.955 --> 30:34.999
that means hope, and the one
on the right side

30:35.166 --> 30:36.584
<i>is the three stars, and a sun.</i>

30:36.668 --> 30:39.128
That means "revolution"
in the Philippines.

30:39.254 --> 30:43.550
So, it symbolizes the fight
or the cause that the Rebels have.

30:43.925 --> 30:47.011
<i>And then the main part of the body</i>
<i>was actually the sugar dome,</i>

30:47.095 --> 30:52.809
<i>and for the wings we used carrots,</i>
<i>piping gel, modeling chocolate, fondant.</i>

30:53.142 --> 30:55.687
LIU: <i>And then, obviously in the back</i>
<i>we have our rice paper,</i>

30:55.812 --> 30:58.940
<i>and we used golden beets, and red beets,</i>
<i>and we extracted the colors</i>

30:59.023 --> 31:01.484
<i>and we used that to dye the rice paper.</i>

31:01.609 --> 31:05.029
ANA:<i> And we used rice on the top</i>
<i>of our ship to create the five elements</i>

31:05.154 --> 31:09.951
<i>and the five symbols</i>
<i>basically represent harmony and balance.</i>

31:11.786 --> 31:13.830
Yes! So, I wanna ask you, Amirah,

31:14.080 --> 31:15.707
how do you feel
that it all comes together?

31:16.374 --> 31:19.002
-First of all, wow.
-Thank you.

31:19.252 --> 31:23.214
You guys really tied it together,
and I wanna talk about the color palette

31:23.298 --> 31:25.884
<i>that you guys chose for this.</i>
<i>It's so warm.</i>

31:26.092 --> 31:31.014
<i>You did go for the gold, and the warmth,</i>
<i>and I also just really appreciate the fact</i>

31:31.139 --> 31:35.643
that you took the time to find elements
that naturally are staining,

31:35.810 --> 31:39.188
and you extracted the color from the beets
and you used them together

31:39.731 --> 31:42.317
<i>to create something completely different.</i>

31:42.525 --> 31:45.695
There's a lot of food elements
in this design, which I love.

31:45.778 --> 31:47.614
I know you were struggling
in the beginning

31:47.697 --> 31:50.825
trying to make the main dome,
so be proud of it

31:51.117 --> 31:53.745
<i>because the domes</i>
<i>are actually beautifully done.</i>

31:54.037 --> 31:55.204
Thank you so much.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.708
BENNY:<i> I can see the rice,</i>
<i>which gives this unique texture.</i>

31:58.875 --> 32:03.129
AMIRAH: Totally. It takes so much time
to individually grab one little grain,

32:03.379 --> 32:04.923
and start making a design.

32:05.131 --> 32:07.258
-LIU: Yes.
-And I think that this created

32:07.342 --> 32:08.676
<i>so much character.</i>

32:09.427 --> 32:11.471
Overall, I think you guys
did an amazing job.

32:11.596 --> 32:12.847
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

32:12.931 --> 32:17.894
And then, the plot thickened,
and you guys had to create a Death Star!

32:18.061 --> 32:21.856
When it comes to creativity
you guys blew it out of this galaxy.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.108
<i>I love that you have black sesame seeds.</i>

32:24.192 --> 32:26.402
And that onion, it looks very realistic...

32:26.486 --> 32:27.946
-So cool.
-AMIRAH: ...And very cool.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.238
I'm wishing you the best of luck.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.865
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.494
Sculptinators, how do you feel?

32:34.953 --> 32:36.788
-Relieved. (CHUCKLES)
-KEKE: Yes!

32:37.163 --> 32:38.665
-That's a common one that we hear.
-Yes.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.960
I can definitely say, I feel real good
about what we've accomplished.

32:42.168 --> 32:45.213
I want you guys to walk us through
the story of your foodscape.

32:45.421 --> 32:50.093
(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

32:50.176 --> 32:52.553
We're the Sculptinators
from planet Sculpton.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.306
And when the Rebel Mechanic
reached out to us

32:55.431 --> 32:56.474
to help them build a ship,

32:56.933 --> 32:59.268
<i>we figured we're not just gonna build</i>
<i>a fighter ship,</i>

32:59.435 --> 33:02.605
<i>we're gonna go ahead and build</i>
<i>a cargo ship that carries fighter ships.</i>

33:02.730 --> 33:05.566
<i>So, we gotta make this thing</i>
<i>on a massive scale</i>

33:05.733 --> 33:08.319
<i>that intimidates the Empire</i>
<i>when the Empire sees it coming.</i>

33:08.569 --> 33:11.656
DUSTIN: <i>The skin of our ship</i>
<i>is comprised of gingerbread</i>

33:11.781 --> 33:14.867
<i>with isomalt coating on top of it</i>
<i>to give it a glossy look.</i>

33:15.076 --> 33:18.913
OBA:<i> We went with daikon radish</i>
<i>and carrot for the laser cannons.</i>

33:19.038 --> 33:21.582
And we also incorporated moving turrets

33:21.666 --> 33:24.043
<i>that are actually done</i>
<i>out of bread and fondant.</i>

33:27.797 --> 33:31.009
I think that this is so creative
in the use of technique,

33:31.092 --> 33:34.262
and the use of ingredients
that we've never seen before.

33:34.470 --> 33:37.223
I have to say that the panels looks great.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.767
<i>I saw you guys through the process</i>
<i>of building this ship,</i>

33:39.934 --> 33:44.605
and I was just amazed with your isomalt
and gingerbread technique.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.774
Because I have never seen
that type of tool

33:46.858 --> 33:48.776
being used to cut isomalt.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.236
You and me both. (CHUCKLES)

33:50.361 --> 33:51.237
All of us.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.573
And then I know you spent a lot of time
on the lighting.

33:53.656 --> 33:56.534
I mean, when I came up to this thing,
it was a Christmas tree.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.786
-(CHUCKLES)
-But you covered all the lighting up,

33:58.870 --> 34:00.580
so I'm just a little confused

34:00.747 --> 34:03.332
on why you spent so much time
adding the lights.

34:03.708 --> 34:06.085
That was a little
communication error there.

34:06.252 --> 34:09.380
Also wanted to mention,
this is more of an Imperial ship.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.050
<i>And it just feels cold</i>
<i>and it looks angular.</i>

34:12.425 --> 34:14.510
But I think that overall
these are some techniques

34:14.719 --> 34:16.929
that are very unique. It blew my mind.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.848
-Thank you.
-And finally,

34:18.931 --> 34:21.434
let's talk about the Death Star.

34:21.851 --> 34:25.480
Well, when the Death Star came into play,
Elaine, she did a couple of layers

34:25.563 --> 34:27.356
of cake icing
and then passed it over to me,

34:27.440 --> 34:29.484
<i>and I got to break out my sculpting tools.</i>

34:29.901 --> 34:32.820
-AMIRAH: <i>I think you nailed it.</i>
-KEKE: Thank you so much, Sculptinators,

34:32.945 --> 34:37.742
wishing you the best of luck.
And next up, let's see Carving Queens.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.622
KEKE: First thing's first, you guys,

34:42.747 --> 34:44.373
you know,
kind of admired each other before

34:44.499 --> 34:46.000
but you never had actually
worked together.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.335
So, how do you feel about that?

34:47.460 --> 34:49.212
Oh, my God. It was a dream come true.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.380
I mean honestly
it couldn't have gone any better.

34:51.464 --> 34:52.465
-I learned so much...
-I agree.

34:52.548 --> 34:54.926
...from these two
and we just somehow made it

34:55.009 --> 34:56.969
-all work, like really well.
-MELANIE: Yeah.

34:57.095 --> 35:00.807
Well, now the fun part. Walk us through
the story of your Foodscape.

35:04.852 --> 35:09.023
ANNIE: <i>Our ship is actually built</i>
<i>from a bunch of salvaged different parts</i>

35:09.107 --> 35:12.276
<i>from the ships that have fallen</i>
<i>out of the sky from the Battle of Endor.</i>

35:12.443 --> 35:15.613
So, our ship is really pieced together
with all of these different parts

35:15.738 --> 35:18.241
and components. On the top of the cockpit,

35:18.324 --> 35:20.409
<i>we have a droid,</i>
<i>and that's made out of sourdough.</i>

35:20.535 --> 35:24.622
JENNA:<i> And the cockpit canopy</i>
<i>was made out of ultra-clear gelatin</i>

35:24.831 --> 35:28.126
<i>with the carved watermelon</i>
<i>as the pilot's helmet.</i>

35:28.292 --> 35:30.503
You can see we have all these laser beams,

35:30.628 --> 35:33.172
we have the exposed engines
from the Y-wing.

35:33.506 --> 35:38.052
MELANIE: <i>The lasers are covered in</i>
<i>a mixture of wild rice and black sesame.</i>

35:38.177 --> 35:41.180
And of course,
we had to be sure that the Empire

35:41.430 --> 35:42.682
wasn't aware of what we were doing,

35:43.015 --> 35:46.435
so we had to get our Ewoks
to help us hide the ship.

35:46.602 --> 35:50.857
So, the look we were going for was
that it had been sitting in the forest.

35:51.566 --> 35:54.694
There's so many things
that I love about this particular design.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.321
I mean, the beautiful technique

35:57.446 --> 36:01.576
<i>that you used to kinda, like,</i>
<i>paint the bread before it was even baked.</i>

36:01.701 --> 36:05.705
This particular technique is tricky.
I never seen it before.

36:06.330 --> 36:10.042
I have to say, you guys took me
to an anxiety trip

36:10.209 --> 36:13.171
when I saw you guys placing
that beautiful gelatin work

36:13.379 --> 36:14.547
<i>on top of the ship.</i>

36:14.672 --> 36:17.008
There were so many things
that could have gone wrong.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.635
-Yes.
-But, hey, it paid off at the end.

36:19.927 --> 36:21.220
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

36:21.470 --> 36:25.099
It's so impressive that even though
you're creating your own story,

36:25.308 --> 36:29.437
you used so many realistic things
from the <i>Star Wars</i> films.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.858
One thing I would've probably done
a little bit differently is the produce.

36:34.358 --> 36:37.904
<i>I almost wish that maybe it had some wire</i>
<i>running through it</i>

36:38.070 --> 36:39.864
and so it looks like it's in the wind.

36:39.947 --> 36:41.616
-It's like flying off of it.
-Yes.

36:41.824 --> 36:43.284
Giving the illusion that the ship

36:43.451 --> 36:44.493
-was taking off.
-Right.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.830
Just those tiny little details
could have taken it to the next level.

36:48.497 --> 36:50.708
-Thank you.
-What do you guys think of the Death Star?

36:50.875 --> 36:54.086
AMIRAH:<i> I love that you spent the time</i>
<i>to score that and give it that texture</i>

36:54.212 --> 36:57.465
that is more accurate to the Death Star.

36:58.090 --> 37:02.887
Well, one thing that Death Stars
are really, really good at is exploding!

37:02.970 --> 37:04.347
-So, let's get into it.
-Yes.
