01:53.600 --> 01:54.434
Captain Tower?

01:55.352 --> 01:56.078
Sorry.

01:56.269 --> 01:57.195
You may go.

01:57.592 --> 01:58.438
Vamos.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.074
Dejenlo pasar.
(Let them pass).

02:02.765 --> 02:03.907
Dejenlo pasar.
(Let them pass).

02:06.943 --> 02:09.247
This film is based on a true story.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.798
The incidents and facts are documented.

02:12.659 --> 02:15.429
Some of the names have been changed
to protect the innocent...

02:15.490 --> 02:17.286
and also to protect the film.

02:24.334 --> 02:26.034
-Where do you live, Tery?
-Why?

02:26.962 --> 02:29.730
So I can take you home.
It's only 30 minutes until curfew.

02:30.131 --> 02:32.025
Just drop us at the Hotel Carrera.

02:40.431 --> 02:41.432
Thanks for the ride.

02:46.098 --> 02:48.888
Listen, if you need anything, call me.

02:48.949 --> 02:51.600
Here's my business card.
My home number's on the other side.

02:52.348 --> 02:53.005
OK.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.713
-Thanks again.
-OK.

03:00.018 --> 03:02.218
It's gonna be curfew.
They shoot everyone on the street.

03:04.368 --> 03:06.718
The phones don't work here either.
Let's get a cab.

03:07.168 --> 03:08.683
Why didn't you let him drive us home?

03:08.744 --> 03:10.294
-I didn't want him to know where I lived.
-What?

03:10.354 --> 03:12.384
'Cause I didn't want him to know
where I lived!

03:14.503 --> 03:15.287
We'll take a taxi.

03:16.594 --> 03:18.011
No, ya no, es muy tarde.
(No, not now, it's too late).

03:21.301 --> 03:24.054
Vicuna Mackenna.
Si, por favor! (Yes, please!)

03:27.944 --> 03:28.746
Blew it.

03:29.983 --> 03:30.875
You did not.

03:31.621 --> 03:33.673
Look, I have a credit card.
We can stay here.

03:40.867 --> 03:42.469
It's curfew. Come on, we better go in.

03:49.743 --> 03:55.479
# ...Your ding-a-ling
# My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling,

03:55.539 --> 03:59.024
# I want you to play with my ding-a-ling

03:59.084 --> 04:02.860
# Oh, your ding-a-ling your ding-a-ling

04:02.920 --> 04:06.863
# We saw you playing with your...
# Ding-a-ling

04:06.923 --> 04:09.158
# Oh, my ding-a-ling

04:09.218 --> 04:13.994
# Everybody sing
I want to play with my ding

04:14.054 --> 04:17.684
# Everybody, my, oh, my... #

04:32.164 --> 04:37.337
# All or nothing at all... #

04:38.200 --> 04:39.102
You all right?

04:42.590 --> 04:43.377
Never better.

04:44.556 --> 04:46.006
Be positive, OK?

04:47.702 --> 04:50.135
I just keep thinking about
what Patrick said about...

04:53.757 --> 04:55.053
bodies everywhere.

04:57.218 --> 04:58.493
Beth's all right.

04:59.279 --> 05:00.652
Nothing can happen to her.

05:01.121 --> 05:02.000
I hope so.

05:04.309 --> 05:06.762
She's probably hiding
in the bath with the duck.

05:07.725 --> 05:09.864
Laugh. It's the best thing I've said all day.

05:13.477 --> 05:14.817
I just wish it was morning.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.625
Er, does the light bother you?

05:21.771 --> 05:24.316
No. No, not at all.

05:32.897 --> 05:35.703
Charlie, you think it's smart
to keep all those notes?

06:03.161 --> 06:04.309
Alto. Es aqui.
(Halt. We're here.)

06:12.784 --> 06:13.506
Beth?

06:14.013 --> 06:16.031
She's probably asleep, Charlie.

06:18.441 --> 06:19.998
Shh, shh, shh.

06:47.427 --> 06:49.514
Beth, it's me.

06:50.501 --> 06:52.721
Oh, shit. You're alive.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.105
Yep.

06:56.780 --> 06:59.081
-Where have you been?
-In Vina.

07:02.096 --> 07:04.841
-You were supposed to be there one day.
-We couldn't get back.

07:06.682 --> 07:09.407
Why didn't you call me?
I've been going nuts.

07:10.729 --> 07:13.718
-There was nothing I could do.
-I thought something terrible had happened.

07:13.779 --> 07:14.958
We got trapped.

07:15.725 --> 07:19.474
you know, they cut the roads down
and shut off the telephone wires.

07:19.925 --> 07:22.130
-Come here.
-I love you.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.276
Come here. I missed you.

07:28.438 --> 07:30.128
I didn't know if you were alive.

07:30.931 --> 07:31.764
Everybody's safe.

07:31.825 --> 07:33.307
-Where's Tery?
-Right there.

07:37.148 --> 07:38.798
-You shit!
-Who?

07:38.858 --> 07:41.989
-You. I was worried about you.
-You were worried?

07:42.050 --> 07:43.724
Cut it out. Wait. Hold it.

07:45.421 --> 07:49.524
You creep! Living out at the beach,
and I'm stuck here with the duck.

07:50.884 --> 07:52.525
This is from Charlie.

07:56.174 --> 08:00.287
I heard it on the radio but there were
bombs going off down the street.

08:00.531 --> 08:01.133
Really?

08:03.513 --> 08:04.623
Were you scared?

08:07.675 --> 08:09.050
Yeah, I hid under the bed.

08:16.224 --> 08:17.315
Want some help?

08:18.725 --> 08:20.407
Get-a your tootsie-fruitsie.

08:20.820 --> 08:22.957
Para ti, para mi.
(For you, for me).

08:24.568 --> 08:25.931
Why a duck? Why a-no goose?

08:27.234 --> 08:28.825
Why a duck? Why a-no goose?

08:32.005 --> 08:34.639
Hey, hope you guys aren't very hungry.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.210
-We're starved.
-Hm!

08:38.539 --> 08:42.102
Seriously, is there anything to eat
besides a couple cockroaches?

08:42.162 --> 08:44.891
No. I'm sorry.
I was scared to go out shopping.

08:45.499 --> 08:48.526
Hey, Beth, I got this of Charlie at Vina.

08:48.701 --> 08:51.807
Hey, Beth. How about a little
Long Island ducky?

08:52.258 --> 08:55.423
Stuffed with a little Peruvian tuna fish,
Spanish olives?

09:00.486 --> 09:04.245
It's OK. I was kidding.
Hey, I was just kidding. OK...

09:04.306 --> 09:05.897
-Old jokes.
-I know.

09:06.209 --> 09:09.516
-I've listened to them for five days.
-Try five years.

09:10.274 --> 09:12.901
-Senora Nunez...
-Here. I know you can't get these here.

09:15.903 --> 09:19.094
You're looking for Beth...Beth Horman?
She's in the bedroom.

09:19.631 --> 09:20.122
Go on.

09:20.161 --> 09:22.409
Pase, pase. 'Si, gracias, senor.'
(Pass, pass. Yes, thanks, sir)

09:23.233 --> 09:27.474
-Oh, careful, senora. Gracias, senor.
-Senora...

09:32.270 --> 09:33.278
Old jokes.

09:38.508 --> 09:41.567
I want to go home, Charlie. Now.

09:41.628 --> 09:44.116
-Come on, Beth.
-We have to.

09:44.578 --> 09:46.242
I can't stand this place any more.

09:46.302 --> 09:48.286
-OK, we'll go.
-I hate this house.

09:48.346 --> 09:50.166
OK, we're going, we're going.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.198
Let's go with Tery, today.

09:55.570 --> 09:58.045
We can't just leave without my stuff.
We gotta settle things up...

09:58.105 --> 10:00.063
-Just leave it.
-We can't.

10:00.310 --> 10:01.657
We're going. I promise you.

10:01.718 --> 10:04.483
You don't know what it's like
being here without you.

10:05.027 --> 10:07.093
Have you heard from David or Frank?

10:07.285 --> 10:08.016
No.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.586
-I hope they're OK.
-Me too.

10:12.905 --> 10:14.976
-I better go check on 'em.
-Let me go.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.475
You take Tery to the airport.

10:16.719 --> 10:18.011
I gotta get outta here.

10:18.072 --> 10:20.422
-OK.
-You guys want me to take a walk?

10:22.290 --> 10:24.955
-Later.
-Not too much later.

10:29.376 --> 10:31.542
Patrick said there were
search-and-destroy missions.

10:32.134 --> 10:34.053
-Patrick?
-A colonel in Vina.

10:34.469 --> 10:36.728
We saw some very upsetting things in Vina.

10:38.873 --> 10:41.015
You gonna let me read
it, or tell it to me?

10:41.627 --> 10:42.701
Whichever you prefer.

10:53.655 --> 10:54.767
End of the line.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.273
-What time you coming home?
-Four o'clock.

11:02.049 --> 11:04.531
I'll be waiting for you.
You better watch out.

11:05.287 --> 11:07.605
-I won't be late.
-You better not be.

11:07.731 --> 11:08.874
I'm warning you.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.967
-Avenida Mata, Plaza Italia!
-That's me.

11:12.028 --> 11:13.060
-You sure you wanna go?
-Yeah.

11:14.042 --> 11:15.649
-Love you.
-Un momentito, por favor.

11:17.049 --> 11:18.320
I'll see you in New York.

11:19.493 --> 11:21.959
Oh, call our parents and tell them
we'll be back in a couple of days.

11:22.020 --> 11:22.500
I will.

11:23.657 --> 11:25.595
Say goodbye to David and Frank for me.

12:08.502 --> 12:09.488
A partir de hoy,
(As of today, )

12:09.549 --> 12:10.320
las mujeres en este pais
(women in this country,)

12:11.111 --> 12:12.429
no usan mes pantalones.
(do not wear pants.)

12:12.779 --> 12:13.771
What did he say?

12:15.127 --> 12:18.524
He said, 'From now on,
women in this county wear dresses.'

12:35.117 --> 12:36.439
My God, look at this.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.285
A week ago,
this was the quietest place on Earth.

12:40.856 --> 12:43.109
-Come on.
-It was a lot cooler than that.

12:45.802 --> 12:47.822
I think Braniffs over there. Wait a second.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.753
No quedan mas, se acabo.
(No more, it it over).

12:59.992 --> 13:00.706
Shit.

13:17.726 --> 13:18.731
Al primero que se mueva,
(The first one to move,)

13:18.792 --> 13:19.617
mi tele un balazo.
(gets a bullet).

13:21.597 --> 13:23.133
Se queda en el suelo hasta que yo diga.
(Stay on the ground until I say).

13:42.087 --> 13:43.081
I'm with her.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.490
Vengo con la senorita.
(I'm with the lady).

13:54.895 --> 13:56.622
Adonde vas con eso?
(Where are you going with that?)

13:58.870 --> 14:00.197
He wants to know where you're going.

14:01.414 --> 14:03.178
I-I'm an American. I
was going to New York.

14:03.239 --> 14:06.075
I was going to Braniff to get my ticket.
My friend was taking me there.

14:06.411 --> 14:09.045
Es norteamericana y va a New York.
(She is American and goes to New York).

14:09.106 --> 14:12.352
The airport is closed,
and there is no more planes.

14:14.476 --> 14:15.317
You may go.

14:35.782 --> 14:36.324
Don't look.

14:39.789 --> 14:40.449
Don't look.

14:42.475 --> 14:45.473
Excuse me.
Could we speak to Mrs. Tyler, please?

14:46.133 --> 14:47.320
There's nobody here by that name.

14:48.611 --> 14:51.935
Could we speak to whoever's helping
Americans leave the county?

14:52.408 --> 14:55.139
That's not our job.
Talk to somebody at the consulate.

14:56.086 --> 14:59.379
We were told that the consulate
was closed because of gunfire

14:59.440 --> 15:01.544
and that the consul was working here.

15:02.307 --> 15:03.757
Yeah? Well, that's news to me.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.881
Could you call for us and maybe find out?

15:08.927 --> 15:12.396
Look lady, if you wanna see if the consulate
is open, you're gonna have to go there.

15:12.463 --> 15:16.029
It's lunch time. Everybody's gone,
and the phones are dead.

15:16.155 --> 15:17.340
Well, thank you very much.

15:24.879 --> 15:28.671
Excuse me. I'm Kate Newman,
a freelance reporter out of New York.

15:28.850 --> 15:31.182
No comment.
Just a friendly misunderstanding.

15:31.909 --> 15:36.656
It's alright. If you don't mind, if I
were you, I'd come back after lunch.

15:36.717 --> 15:39.875
Demand to see the ambassador.
Don't try to go to the consulate...

15:39.936 --> 15:42.761
it's over a mile away and the
streets are just murder.

15:42.821 --> 15:45.498
-Thanks. Wait. Miss Newman?
-Yes?

15:45.698 --> 15:48.353
-Would you do me a big favour?
-Sure.

15:48.820 --> 15:51.496
-Can I borrow your paper?
-Certainly.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.675
I don't understand. There's nothing here.

15:57.284 --> 16:01.088
They told us in Vina that the military were
executing thousands of people here.

16:01.149 --> 16:01.847
There's nothing.

16:03.611 --> 16:04.800
When were you in Vina?

16:05.298 --> 16:06.544
We just got back yesterday.

16:07.610 --> 16:08.890
Wanna hear something strange?

16:09.811 --> 16:12.999
Our hotel was full of
American military officers.

16:14.666 --> 16:15.810
I'd forget about that.

16:17.295 --> 16:20.353
Que esta pasando? Dejame ir, estupido!
(What's going on? Let me go, stupid!)

16:24.689 --> 16:25.773
Dejenme ir con I!
(Let me go with him!)

16:25.834 --> 16:27.674
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

16:27.735 --> 16:29.465
-Do not meddle!
-Jesus!

16:32.784 --> 16:34.666
Dejalos, Ellos son americanos.
(Leave them. They're Americans).

16:37.736 --> 16:39.602
-Are you OK?
-I'm all right.

16:39.754 --> 16:42.071
-For God's sake, why did you do that?
-I don't know.

16:42.776 --> 16:43.609
I just...

16:45.334 --> 16:46.148
I don't know.

16:47.193 --> 16:48.322
Listen, both of you.

16:48.742 --> 16:50.574
Forget this and forget Vina.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.071
Find yourselves a safe place.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.317
A hotel with lots of people around.

16:55.967 --> 16:58.191
Just hole up there
until you can get out of here.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.567
Hey. Hey!

17:03.521 --> 17:05.925
All right? You'll stay here? Gracias.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.452
You'll get a room for Beth and me too?

17:07.512 --> 17:09.646
-I'll get her. We'll be backs soon as we can.
-Okay.

17:09.954 --> 17:11.880
-All right?
-Yeah. Got enough money?

17:11.940 --> 17:14.117
-I think so. How about you?
-I got my credit card.

17:15.096 --> 17:17.306
Here. Take it. You never know.

17:17.929 --> 17:18.929
-Thanks, pal.
-Alright.

17:19.123 --> 17:19.845
Charlie...

17:20.119 --> 17:22.940
-Be careful.
-Don't worry. They can't hurt us.

17:23.220 --> 17:24.205
We're Americans.

17:27.887 --> 17:29.408
I think I felt him kick.

17:33.872 --> 17:35.258
Come on, Maria.

17:36.118 --> 17:37.278
You gotta have faith.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.529
Carlos will be OK.

17:40.194 --> 17:41.254
Tienes que ser fuerte.
(You have to be strong).

17:42.234 --> 17:43.247
Piensa en el nino.
(Think of the child).

17:43.651 --> 17:44.548
She's right.

17:45.211 --> 17:46.492
Se que lo van a matar.
(I know they are going to kill him).

17:46.643 --> 17:48.016
No, Maria!

17:48.489 --> 17:51.006
He's... he's probably up in the
mountains somewhere in hiding.

17:51.067 --> 17:53.450
I know they are going to kill him.
They're killing everybody.

17:56.813 --> 17:58.921
-You should go now.
-I got a few more minutes.

17:58.981 --> 18:00.234
No, you must go.

18:00.916 --> 18:02.315
I will take care of her.

18:05.737 --> 18:06.902
You'll be OK?

18:10.016 --> 18:12.590
-Let me know if you get any news.
-Mmm-hmm.

18:17.511 --> 18:18.444
Take care.

18:31.594 --> 18:33.577
-OK, Frank?
-Yeah.

18:36.143 --> 18:39.395
-How's she doing?
-She's OK. Pia's with her.

18:40.607 --> 18:43.134
Frank, what did happen to Carlos?

18:43.195 --> 18:44.838
What's happening to everybody?

18:46.315 --> 18:49.839
I don't know. Look. Maybe he's at an
embassy as a refugee or somethin'

18:50.022 --> 18:52.150
Or somebody accidentally
blew his brains out.

18:52.350 --> 18:53.348
David.

18:54.966 --> 18:58.898
-What about Silvio?
-He's OK. He's in hiding but, er...

18:59.304 --> 19:02.030
-But Cleo really disappeared.
-Oh, shit.

19:02.294 --> 19:04.674
All of a sudden this place
is like a free-fire zone.

19:05.441 --> 19:06.938
They shoot you just for
being left-handed.

19:06.998 --> 19:10.148
I hope you aren't planning
to stay around too long.

19:10.605 --> 19:12.277
-Party's over.
-It wasn't a party.

19:12.338 --> 19:13.939
They were tying to do something new here.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.819
I'm sorry, y'all, but I've gotta go.
Charlie's gonna kill me.

19:18.395 --> 19:20.323
Promise to call us first thing
when you get to New York?

19:20.384 --> 19:22.841
Use the phone booth at the corner
of West Broadway and Prince, huh?

19:28.559 --> 19:31.295
Frank, I'm sorry things worked out for you
the way they did.

19:32.270 --> 19:35.396
Oh. Listen, in a week, we're all gonna be
playing chess in Washington Square, huh?

19:35.457 --> 19:36.080
Checkers.

19:37.039 --> 19:38.351
Checkers. I hope so.

19:39.066 --> 19:41.698
-Where you gonna be in New York?
-His folks' house, Upper East Side.

19:41.759 --> 19:43.688
-Oh, chic!
-That's us.

19:44.841 --> 19:46.693
Take care. It's my... Oh, my bus!

20:12.110 --> 20:13.036
Taxi!

20:15.850 --> 20:17.662
-Adonde va? (Where to?)
-Vicuna Mackenna por favour.

20:22.802 --> 20:24.373
Oye, ven con nosotros.
(Hey. Come with us.)

20:28.693 --> 20:30.435
'Atencion, atencion.
('Attention, attention.)

20:31.373 --> 20:33.222
Es la hora del toque de queda.
(It's time for the curfew).

20:33.704 --> 20:36.143
'Atencion. Atencion.'
('Attention. Attention').

20:36.757 --> 20:41.436
'Atencion, es la hora del toque de queda.
(Attention, it is time for the curfew.)

20:42.053 --> 20:44.190
'Despejad la calle enseguida.
('Clear the street immediately).

20:44.535 --> 20:46.540
'Vuelvan todos a sus casas.
('All return to your homes).

20:46.601 --> 20:48.086
Despejar la calle.
(Clear the street).

20:48.213 --> 20:50.379
'Atencion, el toque de...'
('Attention, curfew...')

20:57.671 --> 20:59.454
Vete a tu casa!
(Go to your house!)

21:16.085 --> 21:17.111
Que quieres?
(What do you want?)

21:17.172 --> 21:18.278
Soy americana.
(I'm an American.)

21:19.355 --> 21:20.890
El toque de queda, por favour,
(Curfew time. Please,)

21:20.951 --> 21:21.714
necesito ayuda.
(I need help.)

21:21.775 --> 21:24.266
Get out. No foreigners here.

21:24.539 --> 21:26.787
-Help me.
-Get out.

21:28.501 --> 21:29.563
Get out!

22:17.712 --> 22:19.136
Alto, alto!
(Stop! Stop!)

22:21.397 --> 22:22.794
Escondase, escondase!
(Hide, hide!)

24:02.845 --> 24:04.715
Yoo-hoo, Charlie!

24:05.900 --> 24:06.492
Char...

24:16.870 --> 24:17.707
Charlie?

24:31.154 --> 24:32.151
Charlie?

24:41.246 --> 24:42.591
Charlie...

24:47.509 --> 24:48.872
Excuse me, senora.

24:49.881 --> 24:51.586
Los soldados llegaron anoche
(The soldiers came last night)

24:51.647 --> 24:53.014
y destruye todo.
(and destroyed everything).

24:53.802 --> 24:56.638
My husband? Did you see my husband?

25:06.606 --> 25:07.466
Gracias.

25:22.842 --> 25:25.493
You've been in touch
with our embassy there?

25:25.707 --> 25:28.224
Several times, sir.
I spoke to a Mr. Shipler.

25:28.984 --> 25:29.704
And?

25:30.425 --> 25:32.817
Senator, all they seem to know
is that my son is missing.

25:33.317 --> 25:36.718
Hm. Have you been
to the State Department?

25:37.982 --> 25:40.231
I have tried, sir,
many different people.

25:40.292 --> 25:42.104
You are the first that would see me.

25:42.630 --> 25:45.201
Well, I urge you to get to them, Mr. Horman.

25:46.257 --> 25:47.501
I'm tying, sir.

25:50.311 --> 25:51.934
How does your son make a living?

25:52.724 --> 25:54.612
Well, frankly, I...

25:56.348 --> 25:57.639
I guess he's a writer.

25:57.996 --> 26:00.402
Well, he says that he wants to...

26:01.141 --> 26:03.507
Well, The important thing
right now is to help him.

26:04.624 --> 26:05.524
Yes, sir.

26:06.593 --> 26:08.659
Here in the State Department, sir,

26:08.720 --> 26:13.725
we've investigated and have been unable
to find any trace of your son.

26:14.506 --> 26:18.754
Neither our embassy nor the military
government knows where he is.

26:18.815 --> 26:20.773
Yet the New York Times
says he's been arrested.

26:21.166 --> 26:24.027
That's what your daughter-in-law
told the press.

26:24.566 --> 26:25.128
She...

26:26.477 --> 26:30.703
She's been pestering
those embassy people, so they told me.

26:34.770 --> 26:39.041
Tery Simon is a friend. She was there
on vacation, caught in the coup.

26:40.114 --> 26:42.222
She confirmed everything Beth told me.

26:42.656 --> 26:46.379
The arrested Americans have all been
released thanks to our embassy's efforts.

26:46.786 --> 26:47.757
The last two,

26:48.208 --> 26:49.967
Teruggi and Holloway...

26:50.028 --> 26:51.951
They're friends of your son's.

26:52.012 --> 26:55.554
...were released, and Teruggi left
without even thanking the embassy.

26:56.008 --> 26:59.056
Mr. Horman, this is gonna take a little time.

26:59.556 --> 27:04.538
I suggest you go back up to New York
and relax and let us handle it.

27:06.885 --> 27:10.112
I met him in New York
at the Third Church of Christ Scientist.

27:10.173 --> 27:11.175
Doubt he'd remember that.

27:11.348 --> 27:13.556
-Oh, you're a Christian Scientist too?
-Yes.

27:14.287 --> 27:15.363
And your son?

27:15.770 --> 27:18.198
-Well, you know how young people are.
-Of course.

27:19.568 --> 27:20.930
-Mr. Horman,
-Yes?

27:21.223 --> 27:23.318
-would you mind waiting here a moment?
-No, not at all.

27:39.045 --> 27:40.622
-Mr. Horman?
-Yes.

27:40.958 --> 27:43.367
-I think we've met before, haven't we?
-Yes, we have, Congressman.

27:43.428 --> 27:44.268
-New York?
-Yes.

27:44.362 --> 27:45.803
This is my assistant, Ann.

27:45.864 --> 27:47.256
-How do you do?
-You know Bob.

27:47.807 --> 27:49.616
-Yes.
-Do you mind if we talk while walking?

27:50.065 --> 27:51.513
No. Not at all, sir.

27:53.990 --> 27:56.648
-What did they say?
-They think he's in hiding.

27:57.187 --> 27:59.366
-Why?
-Political reasons.

27:59.769 --> 28:02.276
They think he'll surface
as soon as things calm down.

28:02.510 --> 28:06.407
-What are his politics?
-Well, liberal, I suppose.

28:06.783 --> 28:08.297
Liberal, or radical?

28:09.457 --> 28:13.229
Congressman, my son is much too
wishy-washy to be a radical.

28:13.728 --> 28:16.997
-Are you sure?
-What difference does it make?

28:17.058 --> 28:18.969
Well, it doesn't, of course, but...

28:19.344 --> 28:22.221
you said that Percy and
Abzug are sending cables?

28:22.282 --> 28:24.673
Well, they promised to,
but so did Kemp and Koch

28:24.733 --> 28:27.967
and Magnuson and Javits and you.

28:28.432 --> 28:30.004
Well, I'm certainly gonna consider it.

28:30.950 --> 28:32.689
Good luck. God bless.

28:33.814 --> 28:35.417
Nice meeting you, Mr. Horman.

28:36.639 --> 28:37.492
Mr. Horman.

29:14.846 --> 29:16.833
What's that? That.

29:18.278 --> 29:18.878
This?

29:20.094 --> 29:21.280
Those are my books.

29:22.116 --> 29:24.663
One of those is a Bible.
I'm a Christian Scientist.

29:26.322 --> 29:27.255
Pasaporte.
(Passport).

29:33.053 --> 29:36.110
Mr. Horman? I'm Phil Putnam.
I'm the US Consul down here.

29:36.170 --> 29:38.779
-Oh, thank heaven. Very pleased to meet you.
-Sorry about the confusion.

29:38.839 --> 29:41.663
That's all right. Thank you.
Is there any more news?

29:41.876 --> 29:44.933
Nothing so far, but I think
we're on top of the situation.

29:44.994 --> 29:45.680
Mucho gracias.
(Thank you very much).

29:46.110 --> 29:48.155
They cabled us you were
coming from Washington.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.168
Dejenme, yo tengo mi salvoconducto,
(Let me go, I have my safe passage,)

29:50.229 --> 29:52.379
dejenme!
(let me go!)

29:53.525 --> 29:54.978
We're over here in the Ford.

29:55.112 --> 29:55.979
-La maleta, senor consul.
(Your suitcase, Mr. Consul).

29:56.040 --> 29:56.424
-Gracias. (Thanks.)

29:56.998 --> 29:59.755
-You'd think there was a war on.
-There is one, sort of.

29:59.977 --> 30:03.796
-Well, I thought the coup was over.
-It is, but, uh...

30:03.890 --> 30:05.423
there are still problems.

30:05.493 --> 30:09.257
The ambassador can see you this
afternoon at 3:30, if that's okay with you.

30:09.318 --> 30:10.776
-The sooner the better.
-Good.

30:12.889 --> 30:14.816
Cheerful little county
you picked to live in.

30:16.762 --> 30:18.154
Yeah, well...

30:19.274 --> 30:20.699
How long have you been here?

30:21.043 --> 30:24.366
Three years, four months and 19 days.

30:24.427 --> 30:25.945
Counting the days.

30:26.469 --> 30:29.735
It's not a bad county, really.
I'm just ready for a change.

30:30.076 --> 30:31.149
Where will you go next?

30:31.865 --> 30:34.256
My dream is to be posted to Brazil.

30:34.562 --> 30:36.344
But I'll go wherever they send me.

30:36.887 --> 30:38.151
Al hotel Cabrera.

30:44.804 --> 30:46.681
Ed. Ed.

30:49.401 --> 30:51.165
I'm sorry I didn't meet
you at the airport,

30:51.226 --> 30:53.505
but I've been trying to meet
this man, Major Pieto...

30:53.566 --> 30:56.471
Mrs. Horman? Hi. How are ya? You all right?

30:56.711 --> 30:57.745
All right.

30:58.823 --> 31:02.810
Good, good. Listen, we'll be back
to pick you folks up at 2:30.

31:02.871 --> 31:04.408
-Yes, 2:30. That's fine. Thank you.
-Right.

31:04.469 --> 31:05.892
I've been trying to meet
this man, Major Pieto...

31:05.953 --> 31:07.110
Let's go upstairs, shall we?

31:07.440 --> 31:11.454
And this morning was the only time that
I had that I... that I could meet him.

31:15.380 --> 31:16.668
-Here.
-And the bathroom, sir.

31:16.729 --> 31:17.684
-Yeah. Si.
-Thank you very much.

31:28.170 --> 31:29.170
How was your trip?

31:30.309 --> 31:31.568
A total delight.

31:37.514 --> 31:38.540
How's Elizabeth?

31:43.129 --> 31:44.483
How do you suppose?

31:50.646 --> 31:51.639
You blame me?

32:08.945 --> 32:10.516
Did you find out anything in Washington?

32:11.822 --> 32:13.696
No, but...

32:14.716 --> 32:18.001
Putnam thinks that things down here
are in good hands.

32:20.778 --> 32:21.758
You don't agree?

32:22.184 --> 32:24.958
Well, I don't expect
a whole hell of a lot any more.

32:26.065 --> 32:26.595
No?

32:29.628 --> 32:30.361
Why?

32:32.003 --> 32:33.629
He's been gone two weeks.

32:34.269 --> 32:38.321
And I don't know. They give me the same
song and dance over and over again.

32:41.509 --> 32:42.919
He could be hurt or...

32:44.669 --> 32:47.409
tortured.
They don't give a goddamn about him.

32:47.470 --> 32:51.897
Oh, look, really. I don't want to hear
any of your anti-Establishment paranoia!

32:53.349 --> 32:55.514
I certainly get enough of that from my son.

32:59.086 --> 33:00.501
If he had settled down
where he belongs,

33:00.562 --> 33:02.374
this never would have
happened in the first place.

33:07.293 --> 33:09.537
Please don't cry.

33:20.798 --> 33:21.910
Beth, I'll find him.

33:28.883 --> 33:31.470
Charles wrote that these toilet articles
were hard to get.

33:32.767 --> 33:33.751
Not any more.

33:37.190 --> 33:38.711
His mother sent him fudge.

33:45.843 --> 33:48.376
Um, why don't you go freshen up, huh?

33:48.437 --> 33:50.523
I mean... yes, we only have one hour.

33:58.534 --> 33:59.831
Oh, by the way, where's Tery?

34:01.487 --> 34:03.051
At Braniff, picking up her ticket.

34:03.111 --> 34:04.180
When does she go?

34:04.831 --> 34:05.601
Tomorrow.

34:05.662 --> 34:06.592
Is she all right?

34:08.033 --> 34:10.326
Yeah, Ed. So am I.

34:53.319 --> 34:54.141
Come in.

35:06.445 --> 35:07.360
Ta-daa.

35:10.664 --> 35:13.080
Beth, before we get started,
I have to ask you a question.

35:13.141 --> 35:15.645
I want you to answer me
absolutely honestly.

35:16.973 --> 35:18.346
-OK.
-What did he do?

35:19.163 --> 35:19.763
What?

35:19.961 --> 35:23.292
What stupid thing did Charles
do to cause his arrest,

35:23.353 --> 35:24.727
or make him go into hiding?

35:25.279 --> 35:27.377
Ed, Charlie is not a stupid man.

35:27.438 --> 35:28.890
Well, he wasn't too smart.

35:29.010 --> 35:30.599
I can tell you, getting in such a mess

35:30.660 --> 35:33.223
that I have to fly 16
hours in order to...

35:36.371 --> 35:37.988
Sometimes I honestly think

35:38.049 --> 35:40.095
that that boy is incapable
of doing anything,

35:40.554 --> 35:43.199
except give idealistic speeches and...

35:43.385 --> 35:45.365
write novels that'll
never be published.

35:46.056 --> 35:48.531
Unless, the entire disappearing act

35:48.592 --> 35:51.543
is a stunt to publicize his
forthcoming autobiography.

35:51.604 --> 35:53.020
Why don't you just go home?

35:53.385 --> 35:55.007
I'll find my husband by myself.

35:56.269 --> 35:58.775
-Beth, I'll be ready in a few minutes.
-Take your time.

35:58.836 --> 36:00.739
I still want an answer to that question.

36:17.058 --> 36:19.747
-Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Horman.
-Mr. Horman. Come right in, sir.

36:19.808 --> 36:21.463
-My pleasure.
-Mine too.

36:21.724 --> 36:24.494
Captain Tower, US Navy,
our senior military group officer.

36:24.555 --> 36:27.385
-Captain, how are you?
-Colonel Clay, our defence attache

36:28.287 --> 36:29.713
-Mr. Horman.
-Thank you.

36:31.927 --> 36:34.079
Mrs. Horman, how are you today?

36:34.140 --> 36:34.998
Fine.

36:36.938 --> 36:37.877
Shall I review?

36:38.395 --> 36:39.720
Yes. But first...

36:40.528 --> 36:43.690
I want to express our deep concern
over your son's disappearance.

36:43.750 --> 36:45.649
-Thank you.
-I assure you

36:46.065 --> 36:50.059
every element at our disposal
has been and will continue to be utilised

36:50.120 --> 36:51.979
to facilitate his safe return.

36:52.040 --> 36:55.489
That's exactly what I'd hoped to hear,
Mr. Ambassador.

36:56.457 --> 36:57.479
Go ahead, Consul Putnam.

36:57.540 --> 37:00.834
Sir, we've conducted a...
an extensive investigation.

37:00.928 --> 37:03.872
Captain Tower's staff have
interviewed several residents

37:03.933 --> 37:06.585
in the area where Charles was last seen.

37:06.645 --> 37:10.829
Colonel Clay has maintained his contacts
with military and police authorities.

37:12.637 --> 37:16.830
But after analysing all the data,
we still come to the conclusion

37:16.891 --> 37:19.096
-that he must be in hiding.
-From what?

37:19.974 --> 37:23.661
That's a valid question, and one
we'd also like the answer to.

37:24.261 --> 37:26.519
We've been through this a hundred times.

37:26.883 --> 37:28.824
You know damn well he's not in hiding.

37:28.885 --> 37:31.640
Our whole neighbourhood saw him
picked up by a goon squad.

37:31.987 --> 37:33.526
The military swears they haven't got him.

37:33.587 --> 37:36.244
Mrs. Norman, I've been to
the carabinero stations,

37:36.305 --> 37:38.529
I've been to the department
of investigations,

37:38.590 --> 37:40.653
I even got into the national stadium,

37:41.017 --> 37:43.285
and he's just plain
not in their custody.

37:44.038 --> 37:45.313
So, you see, Mr. Horman,

37:45.387 --> 37:48.333
the hiding theory seems to be the most
viable, at least for the present.

37:48.394 --> 37:49.888
That's dumb. If he were in hiding,

37:49.949 --> 37:52.056
he'd call me and let me
know he was all right.

37:52.561 --> 37:53.630
Maybe he can't.

37:53.921 --> 37:56.291
There have been a lot of
civilian accidents and injuries.

37:57.017 --> 37:58.507
No shit, Sherlock.

38:02.534 --> 38:04.525
Were you going to say something,
Mr. Horman?

38:05.052 --> 38:06.857
Er, yes. Er...

38:07.928 --> 38:11.259
As the colonel suggested,
if Charles was possibly injured,

38:11.320 --> 38:14.999
he could be in a coma, or
suffering from amnesia, or...

38:15.060 --> 38:16.293
Have you checked the hospitals?

38:16.538 --> 38:17.783
I have checked some of them. Yes.

38:17.844 --> 38:18.731
Why not all of them?

38:19.108 --> 38:22.567
Well, it's pretty difficult to get into
some hospitals right now, and...

38:22.811 --> 38:25.835
Translated, he means you can break a leg
tripping over bodies.

38:28.611 --> 38:31.272
The only thing that we know
for sure right now

38:31.637 --> 38:32.792
is where he isn't.

38:34.083 --> 38:35.671
I may have some further...

38:36.079 --> 38:39.055
news for you after tonight.
I'm having dinner with the...

38:39.569 --> 38:41.651
junta's chief of staff,
Admiral Huidobro.

38:41.712 --> 38:43.957
God. That one again?

38:44.891 --> 38:46.329
Haven't you seen him yet?

38:46.901 --> 38:48.574
These people are very busy.

38:49.072 --> 38:50.470
I bet they are.

38:51.974 --> 38:54.329
By the way, Beth, do you have
that list I asked you for?

38:54.390 --> 38:55.510
What list?

38:56.397 --> 39:00.682
I asked her for a list of Charles' friends
so I could extend this investigation.

39:02.205 --> 39:03.873
I'll... I'll see that you get it. Uh...

39:05.573 --> 39:08.227
Beth, didn't you say that
several of Charles's friends...

39:08.328 --> 39:11.514
were contacted by the military after
he was supposedly arrested?

39:11.608 --> 39:13.099
Yes, and they all called the consulate.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.833
-What telephone calls?
-I wasn't aware of any...

39:15.894 --> 39:17.488
You certainly were.

39:18.437 --> 39:22.801
I saw all the notes on the calls the day
Shipler showed me your file cards.

39:23.238 --> 39:24.454
I forgot that, sir.

39:24.600 --> 39:27.266
You're right. Yes, I
think I do remember.

39:28.137 --> 39:31.007
Why don't you check that out sometime
in the next couple of days?

39:31.198 --> 39:32.311
-Right, sir.
-And, uh...

39:32.832 --> 39:34.774
We'll meet again
to take stock of the situation.

39:35.834 --> 39:38.801
And if you need anything else...
Dave. Driver, please.

39:39.090 --> 39:43.271
If you need anything, let me or Captain
Tower know, and we'll arrange it.

39:43.332 --> 39:45.487
Very well. I'll see he gets
that list in the morning.

39:45.557 --> 39:46.695
-Good.
-Not from me, he won't

39:46.775 --> 39:49.996
And I'll start checking the phone logs
and start working on the hospitals.

39:50.163 --> 39:51.994
-Thank you, Consul.
-Call me Phil.

39:52.055 --> 39:52.475
Phil.

39:52.770 --> 39:54.577
-Mrs. Horman.
-Thank you again.

39:54.638 --> 39:56.493
-You bet.
-What is the matter with you?

39:56.554 --> 39:58.142
Why were you so rude in there?

39:58.203 --> 40:00.807
-Jesus Christ!
-And do you swear all the time?

40:00.868 --> 40:02.690
I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend you.

40:03.136 --> 40:05.133
Why aren't you cooperating with them?

40:05.194 --> 40:07.414
-I am cooperating with them!
-Oh...

40:07.475 --> 40:09.744
I've been cooperating for two weeks, Ed!

40:10.101 --> 40:13.273
I'm sick and tired of getting fucked around
by these people, that's why!

40:13.896 --> 40:15.690
-To the hotel, sir?
-Yes.

40:21.265 --> 40:23.066
-Want some?
-Uh-uh.

40:24.789 --> 40:25.569
Back.

40:31.765 --> 40:32.733
Back.

40:36.170 --> 40:37.230
One more step.

40:42.581 --> 40:43.607
It's an old joke.

40:44.668 --> 40:46.194
Listen. We better go.

40:46.255 --> 40:48.266
-Last bus is at six.
-Right.

40:48.346 --> 40:49.272
Vamonos!
(Let's go!)

40:50.540 --> 40:52.406
-Catch!
-Right. I'll race ya.

40:52.773 --> 40:55.109
-Oh, no. No, you won't!
-I'll beat ya!

40:56.302 --> 40:57.917
Hay huelga de camioneros
(There is a truckers strike)

40:57.978 --> 41:00.608
y estan bloqueados todos los caminos.
(and all roads are blocked.)

41:00.669 --> 41:01.601
Si, gracias.
(Yes thanks.)

41:02.408 --> 41:03.767
-Fucking great.
-What is it?

41:03.828 --> 41:06.521
The truckers are on strike,
roads are all blocked.

41:06.987 --> 41:09.154
-How do we get back?
-We don't.

41:09.728 --> 41:11.277
Beth is gonna go nuts.

41:12.372 --> 41:14.591
Isn't there another way? Any trains?

41:14.934 --> 41:16.792
Manana, a las 9.
(Tomorrow, at 9).

41:16.926 --> 41:18.308
-What'd he say?
-He said,

41:18.770 --> 41:21.466
with any luck, there might be
a train tomorrow at nine.

41:23.852 --> 41:25.271
So what do we do till then?

41:30.943 --> 41:32.808
-What is it?
-I don't know.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.206
That's the morning the coup started?

42:00.267 --> 42:01.312
You got it.

42:01.774 --> 42:04.185
The 24-hour curfew had
shut everything down.

42:04.578 --> 42:05.504
The phones were out.

42:05.884 --> 42:08.033
Charlie freaked because
he couldn't reach Beth.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.022
Did you pick that up from Charlie?

42:11.327 --> 42:12.747
Charles picked it up from me.

42:14.050 --> 42:15.228
What happened next?

42:15.585 --> 42:17.116
Well, we stayed at the hotel.

42:17.346 --> 42:18.647
We didn't have much choice.

42:18.993 --> 42:20.793
And that's when you met
all the Americans, right?

42:20.854 --> 42:21.418
That's right.

42:21.656 --> 42:23.403
And they were caught up
by the coup also?

42:26.311 --> 42:27.732
-The others.
-Then you met Babcock?

42:28.300 --> 42:29.264
No. No.

42:29.503 --> 42:30.986
Him we met the next morning.

42:31.308 --> 42:32.867
Wednesday, September 12.

42:33.434 --> 42:34.613
-Here?
-Yeah, sure.

42:36.049 --> 42:38.418
Me permite su periodico, senor.
(May I see your paper if you're finished with it, sir?)

42:40.628 --> 42:43.003
You would do better to ask
in English, monsieur.

42:43.172 --> 42:44.997
Tu es francais? Pardon.
(You're French. Excuse me. Please forgive me.).

42:45.058 --> 42:45.647
English.

42:46.383 --> 42:48.527
I come from Paris, Texas, boy.

42:49.613 --> 42:52.095
-You're American.
-Yeah. Red, white and blue.

42:52.156 --> 42:54.381
-Well, you fooled me.
-Good, good.

42:54.815 --> 42:57.641
I was just pulling your leg
there for you a little bit, uh...

42:57.754 --> 42:58.921
-Charlie Horman.
-Charlie.

42:58.982 --> 43:01.816
Yeah. Nice to meet you.
This is my friend, uh, Terry Simon.

43:01.877 --> 43:04.096
-Terry, how are you?
-All right.

43:04.336 --> 43:05.178
Yes, you are.

43:06.770 --> 43:09.011
Erm... That's my friend.

43:09.072 --> 43:10.817
-Hello.
-Hello.

43:11.168 --> 43:13.019
-Do you mind?
-No, help yourself.

43:13.080 --> 43:15.161
Thanks. What'd you say
your name was again?

43:15.222 --> 43:17.792
Well, I didn't say, Charles,
but my name's Andrew Babcock.

43:17.945 --> 43:19.451
Andrew? Nice to meet you.

43:19.815 --> 43:21.366
Thanks a lot. Are you a tourist?

43:21.701 --> 43:22.987
No, not exactly.

43:23.533 --> 43:24.627
What are you doing down here?

43:25.390 --> 43:29.769
Well, the navy sent me down here
to do a job and, uh... she's done.

43:32.124 --> 43:33.464
Where are you stationed?

43:33.975 --> 43:34.815
Panama.

43:35.160 --> 43:37.074
Panama's my home base,
if that's what you mean.

43:37.191 --> 43:39.129
Huh. Well, you said you're with the navy.

43:39.992 --> 43:43.027
Yeah, well, I'm really retired.
I'm just on a special assignment.

43:43.088 --> 43:44.916
Really? What's it like in Panama?

43:45.656 --> 43:47.319
-Panama's nice.
-Is it?

43:48.599 --> 43:53.104
And it's a good place
to keep an eye on everything.

43:59.560 --> 44:01.520
Well, there's my man from Milgroup.

44:03.606 --> 44:07.739
-Milgroup? What's Milgroup?
-Milgroup's just U.S. military group.

44:09.069 --> 44:12.149
Well, I'm afraid there isn't
much news in there...

44:12.210 --> 44:15.505
for someone with such big ears
and such a long nose.

44:15.566 --> 44:17.594
-But enjoy it.
-I will.

44:18.383 --> 44:19.774
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

44:21.319 --> 44:22.299
Sure enough.

44:25.979 --> 44:27.559
I remember Charlie said,
'That's incredible.'

44:27.620 --> 44:28.376
That's incredible.

44:29.350 --> 44:32.800
-I can't believe he just told us all that.
-'I can't believe he said all that to us.'

44:32.910 --> 44:35.418
That's when he decided we
should both take notes.

44:35.649 --> 44:36.643
Notes on what?

44:37.180 --> 44:38.752
-Well...
-Didn't you hear what she just said?

44:39.493 --> 44:43.653
Ed, all those American officials in Vina
were probably involved in the coup.

44:44.416 --> 44:46.120
-Do you believe that, Terry?
-Well, I don't...

44:46.181 --> 44:48.300
Wait a minute.
Why don't you believe me?

44:48.361 --> 44:51.300
For the simple reason that you are married
to Charles. It colours your perceptions.

44:51.361 --> 44:54.252
Well, you're his damn father.
What does that do to your perceptions?

44:54.313 --> 44:55.219
Hey, come on.

44:55.692 --> 44:57.830
God! Whose side are you on?

45:02.200 --> 45:03.545
How did you finally...

45:08.696 --> 45:10.252
How did you finally get home?

45:10.626 --> 45:12.224
Ray Tower drove us back.

45:15.160 --> 45:15.895
Um...

45:17.199 --> 45:18.160
That's all right.

45:18.293 --> 45:20.999
Listen. If you need anything,
feel free to call me.

45:21.060 --> 45:22.811
Here's my business card.

45:22.872 --> 45:24.808
-Home number's on the back.
-Okay.

45:25.036 --> 45:27.911
Oh, Terry, guess who's having
dinner together again tonight.

45:28.368 --> 45:29.541
Admiral Huidobro?

45:29.866 --> 45:30.550
Uh-huh.

45:31.756 --> 45:34.019
You gotta be kidding me. Again?

45:34.170 --> 45:37.290
-Again. Can you believe that guy?
-Did he ask you for the list?

45:37.351 --> 45:38.367
-Yeah.
-Of course.

45:38.428 --> 45:40.321
-Wait a minute. Are you talking about Tower?
-Yeah.

45:40.382 --> 45:42.002
Well, how did you get
to know him so well?

45:42.063 --> 45:43.744
We don't know him so well.

45:44.056 --> 45:46.671
Ed, when Charlie first disappeared,
that's who we contacted.

45:46.987 --> 45:48.553
He invited us for dinner at his house.

45:48.614 --> 45:50.812
-He said Admiral...
-Huidobro.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.648
Huidobro would be there too...

45:52.709 --> 45:55.209
and that it might be good for us to come
so we could talk to him.

45:55.520 --> 45:58.150
Of course, we went,
but this admiral never showed up.

46:07.920 --> 46:10.499
Ed, it happened just like this.

46:28.997 --> 46:32.797
You were saying you went to Tower's
house to see that admiral, and...

46:32.858 --> 46:34.961
Well, of course, this
admiral never showed up.

46:35.022 --> 46:36.972
And by that time it
was way past curfew,

46:37.033 --> 46:38.917
and Tower insisted that
we spend the night...

46:38.978 --> 46:40.732
and there wasn't anything else
we could do.

46:41.906 --> 46:42.624
Terry?

46:50.100 --> 46:51.093
What do you want?

46:52.606 --> 46:54.747
-Got everything you need?
-Yes.

46:56.304 --> 46:58.001
Look. I appreciate everything
you've done for us,

46:58.062 --> 47:00.080
but would you do me a
favour and get out of here?

47:01.139 --> 47:02.078
Please.

47:03.823 --> 47:05.399
You know, if I were you...

47:08.740 --> 47:10.710
I'd quit living in the past.

47:12.010 --> 47:15.450
I think it's about time
you started thinking about your future.

47:23.623 --> 47:26.258
You've gotta learn to stay ahead
of the power curve, kid.

47:27.520 --> 47:29.622
-You know what I mean?
-Beat it, Ray! Leave me alone!

47:29.683 --> 47:30.909
Terry, it's me.

47:32.023 --> 47:33.847
It's an old aircraft carrier term.

47:33.908 --> 47:36.929
-Come on. Hurry up.
-You see, if a pilot...

47:36.990 --> 47:38.791
-Hurry up. He's coming.
-gets ahead of the power curve...

47:38.852 --> 47:41.499
and something happens, then he
can always pull up and away.

47:41.560 --> 47:43.940
-Terry, hurry up.
-But if he falls behind the power curve...

47:44.000 --> 47:47.575
-Come on. Now!
-and something happens, then adios, pal.

47:47.743 --> 47:50.543
You gotta learn to stay ahead
of the power curve, kid.

47:55.096 --> 47:57.634
And when we woke up
the next morning, Tower was gone.

48:00.296 --> 48:02.270
-What time does your plane leave?
-9:00.

48:02.337 --> 48:03.742
Would you take a letter for
Elizabeth back with you?

48:03.803 --> 48:04.479
Sure.

48:04.540 --> 48:07.010
-Thank you. I'll see you both in the morning.
-Good night.

48:07.071 --> 48:09.139
-Night, Ed.
-Want some fudge?

48:09.213 --> 48:09.733
Yeah.

48:15.516 --> 48:17.310
Why did you take a bath in his house?

48:18.876 --> 48:20.785
Ed, I... I took a bath.

48:21.929 --> 48:23.067
We were stuck there.

48:33.020 --> 48:33.866
Ed.

48:35.166 --> 48:35.886
Ed.

48:37.590 --> 48:40.336
Wait a minute. Where are you goin'?

48:40.840 --> 48:43.131
Can't you lower your voice? For a walk.

48:43.756 --> 48:45.965
You can't go out for a walk.
It's curfew.

48:46.280 --> 48:47.276
You'll get shot.

48:57.449 --> 48:59.472
Did she have an affair with Charles?

49:02.769 --> 49:04.328
Why did you come here?

49:10.717 --> 49:13.127
Habia cuatro soldados con un oficial...
(There were four soldiers with an officer...)

49:13.188 --> 49:15.009
y dos mas trayendo unas cajas.
(and two more bringing some boxes).

49:15.353 --> 49:17.696
She says it was late afternoon
when they brought him out.

49:17.979 --> 49:20.239
There were four soldiers
and an officer with him...

49:20.530 --> 49:22.830
and two other soldiers
carried boxes of things.

49:27.980 --> 49:29.742
Habia otros soldados?
(Were there other soldiers?)

49:30.236 --> 49:31.503
Si, habia muchos.
(Yes, there are many).

49:31.577 --> 49:33.470
Esperando en un camion militar.
(Waiting in a military truck).

49:33.746 --> 49:35.905
'There were many other soldiers
waiting in an army truck.'

49:36.583 --> 49:37.995
Que estas diciendo, mujer?
(What are you saying, woman?)

49:38.056 --> 49:39.990
No fue asi. Te equivocas.
(It was not like that. You're wrong).

49:40.328 --> 49:42.269
Yo no vi mas que unos pocos milicos,
(I did not see more than a few soldiers,)

49:42.330 --> 49:43.979
y en un auto particular.
(and in a private vehicle).

49:44.040 --> 49:46.880
-What did he say?
-He claims it was a civilian truck...

49:47.010 --> 49:48.339
and there weren't many soldiers.

49:48.862 --> 49:50.660
No fue asi. Estoy seguro.
(It wasn't like that. I'm certain).

49:50.976 --> 49:52.536
Habia muchos soldados,
(There were many soldiers,)

49:52.597 --> 49:55.276
en un camion del ejercito. Si, yo lo vi.
(in an army truck. Yes, I saw them).

49:55.516 --> 49:59.076
She says, 'Yes, there were many soldiers,
and it was definitely an army truck.'

50:01.638 --> 50:03.257
Is she sure it was Charles?

50:03.940 --> 50:06.590
Estas seguro de que el hombre era mi marido?
(Are you sure the man was my husband?)

50:07.160 --> 50:08.887
Yo estoy segura que si.
(I am sure of that, yes).

50:09.105 --> 50:10.545
-Huh?
-She's pretty sure.

50:10.624 --> 50:12.005
She's pretty sure.

50:12.072 --> 50:14.802
With witnesses like this, no wonder
nobody can find him. Well, um...

50:14.933 --> 50:16.277
Perdon... Buenos...
(Excuse us. Good...)

50:17.669 --> 50:18.249
Gracias. (Thank you).

50:19.283 --> 50:20.221
Hasta luego.
(So long).

50:23.149 --> 50:24.477
Is this the way you found it?

50:24.765 --> 50:26.825
No. It was a real shambles.

50:30.929 --> 50:33.027
-You were living here?
-Yeah.

50:36.496 --> 50:37.051
Why?

50:39.680 --> 50:41.398
What do you mean?
We live like everybody else.

50:41.559 --> 50:45.406
Well, I guess it's easy to be poor when you
have a round-trip ticket in your pocket.

50:46.873 --> 50:48.409
Let me explain something, Ed.

50:49.586 --> 50:52.377
We're here because we wanna be here.

50:52.740 --> 50:53.444
We like it.

50:54.233 --> 50:56.673
We have friends here.
We're not playin' poor.

51:05.313 --> 51:08.224
It may sound weird to you, but this is
one of the happiest homes I've ever had.

51:09.849 --> 51:11.725
And I know Charlie feels the same way.

51:14.910 --> 51:16.086
Doesn't look like it now, but...

51:17.032 --> 51:18.619
we really had it together here.

51:22.257 --> 51:23.529
Local artist.

51:27.640 --> 51:29.940
Beth, the duck is not here?

51:30.036 --> 51:31.936
No, he's gone.

51:32.553 --> 51:34.014
He'll be back with Charlie?

51:35.633 --> 51:36.533
Yes, I hope so.

51:37.233 --> 51:38.167
Thank you

51:42.929 --> 51:44.690
Your son's a pretty
popular guy around here.

51:47.207 --> 51:48.397
The Little Prince?

51:49.023 --> 51:50.289
That's a great book.

51:51.810 --> 51:55.234
When we first got married, Charlie would
read me a chapter of this every night.

51:55.473 --> 51:59.229
It's about this little prince,
and he meets a wild fox in the desert...

51:59.290 --> 52:02.809
and little by little, by being very gentle
and kind and thoughtful...

52:03.070 --> 52:04.305
he tames the fox,

52:04.698 --> 52:06.046
so the fox tells him a secret.

52:06.960 --> 52:07.576
Let's see.

52:09.846 --> 52:13.170
'It's only with the heart
that one can see rightly.

52:13.600 --> 52:16.445
What is essential
is invisible to the eye.'

52:18.456 --> 52:19.392
What is essential?

52:20.953 --> 52:22.370
The stuff you can't see.

52:28.776 --> 52:30.288
This is Charles's handwriting,
isn't it?

52:33.646 --> 52:37.746
'Once upon a time there was a country
so far north it was further north...

52:37.807 --> 52:38.993
than the North Pole.'

52:42.323 --> 52:44.853
Is this part of the same, uh, book?
There's... No.

52:45.170 --> 52:45.933
Charles...

52:46.853 --> 52:47.806
wrote this. Mm-hmm.

52:49.157 --> 52:51.457
'It was further north
than the Big Dipper.

52:51.636 --> 52:55.337
It was even further north than the Milky Way,
and that's pretty far north.'

52:56.080 --> 52:59.450
'Nobody knew the name of the country
except the folks who lived there...

52:59.511 --> 53:02.863
'cause the ink in the explorers' pen froze
before they could write it down.'

53:04.016 --> 53:06.413
What does this mean?
'The Sunshine Grabber.'

53:07.020 --> 53:10.371
That's the name of the poem, and it's
an animated film Charlie's working on.

53:10.489 --> 53:11.890
This is one of the characters.

53:13.209 --> 53:14.519
Recognize the eyes?

53:19.629 --> 53:23.932
Well, he... he seems so innocent,
almost deliberately naive.

53:26.110 --> 53:27.193
Is that so bad?

53:29.343 --> 53:30.261
Is that so good?

53:31.863 --> 53:32.882
You raised him.

53:38.169 --> 53:40.685
-Who is it?
-It's me, Beth.

53:41.343 --> 53:42.177
Hello.

53:46.653 --> 53:48.983
Senora Duran. Ed Horman.

53:49.166 --> 53:51.969
This is the lady I was telling you about
whose mother lives across the street.

53:52.803 --> 53:54.670
-Hello.
-Buenos dias. (Good day).

53:56.493 --> 53:57.642
El coche esta esperando.
(The car is waiting).

53:57.744 --> 53:58.409
Taxi's waiting.

54:02.483 --> 54:03.672
Aqui, a la derecha.
(Here, to the right).

54:05.310 --> 54:07.977
I was leaving my mother,
who lives across the street.

54:08.799 --> 54:13.299
A taxi came for me just when the soldiers
put your husband in the truck.

54:14.973 --> 54:16.451
Ahora a la izquierda, por favor.
(Now to the left, please).

54:27.957 --> 54:30.695
My taxi followed
the same road the truck took.

54:34.647 --> 54:38.395
Then they drove right into that big door
and went inside the stadium.

54:39.351 --> 54:41.421
-How come you followed them?
-She didn't. She was just...

54:41.482 --> 54:44.234
Let her answer. Please. Why did your taxi
take the same route as the truck?

54:45.299 --> 54:47.230
Well, I just live beyond the stadium...

54:48.173 --> 54:51.434
and I have to go past here when I come
from the house of my mother.

54:53.829 --> 54:54.610
Okay.

54:58.016 --> 54:59.965
-I don't believe that!
-Ed, don't.

55:00.026 --> 55:00.988
Would you... What?

55:01.181 --> 55:03.082
Don't. They could arrest her
just for talking to us.

55:11.010 --> 55:11.885
Hello, Beth.

55:12.888 --> 55:15.682
Mr. Horman, my name's Kate Newman.
I'm a reporter.

55:15.886 --> 55:17.874
I'm wondering if it's
true that you are fed up

55:17.935 --> 55:20.006
with the way the embassy's
been handling this...

55:20.067 --> 55:21.736
and that you're planning
your own investigation?

55:22.223 --> 55:23.294
Ed, there's Putnam.

55:24.463 --> 55:25.863
Oh, but, uh...

55:26.130 --> 55:28.370
I'm just not interested in challenging
what they've done.

55:28.431 --> 55:31.183
-I'm concerned with getting back my son.
-I can certainly understand that...

55:31.244 --> 55:32.363
Excuse us, please.

55:32.763 --> 55:34.339
Beth, get him to talk to me, will you?

55:34.437 --> 55:35.315
-Okay.
-Okay.

55:38.740 --> 55:39.800
Any news?

55:42.107 --> 55:44.167
-What happened?
-Shall we sit down?

55:44.316 --> 55:45.348
Is there any news?

55:45.409 --> 55:48.875
Well, we backtracked over
all our military leads so far...

55:48.936 --> 55:51.372
and they still deny
any knowledge of his arrest.

55:51.890 --> 55:55.590
We also had a fingerprint check made
at all the morgues. Came up negative.

55:55.953 --> 55:58.683
-Do you trust your sources?
-Captain Tower checked them himself.

55:59.199 --> 56:00.823
Oh, well, then I'm sure
they're impeccable.

56:01.210 --> 56:05.700
What we need now is more background
information, mostly from Beth.

56:06.036 --> 56:08.389
For example, why you were living here.

56:10.071 --> 56:12.327
We were tired of seeing the world
through the New York Times.

56:12.516 --> 56:15.179
-We wanted to travel.
-Why this country specifically?

56:15.240 --> 56:17.494
We'd been all over Latin America.
This seemed the best of it.

56:17.750 --> 56:18.633
You mean politically?

56:18.930 --> 56:20.061
I mean every way,

56:20.588 --> 56:22.592
till your generals took over.

56:23.022 --> 56:24.479
They're not our generals, Beth.

56:24.540 --> 56:26.897
Gentlemen, why don't we
shift our ground a little here.

56:27.620 --> 56:29.456
Beth, what was Charles doing?

56:29.517 --> 56:30.980
-'Was'?
-What kind of work? I'm sorry.

56:31.041 --> 56:32.732
-What kind of work is Charles doing?
-Thank you.

56:32.793 --> 56:36.339
He's, uh, working on
an animated children's film...

56:36.400 --> 56:38.518
researching a screenplay,
and he writes articles.

56:38.579 --> 56:39.555
Articles for FIN?

56:39.899 --> 56:42.459
-What is FIN?
-It's a left-wing newspaper.

56:42.619 --> 56:44.637
It is not left-wing.

56:45.090 --> 56:46.281
Besides, he doesn't write for it.

56:46.342 --> 56:50.261
He translates news and feature stories
for such bastions of American communism...

56:50.322 --> 56:52.465
as the New York Post
and the Wall Street Journal.

56:52.526 --> 56:54.308
Just a moment. There's another
theory kicking around.

56:54.560 --> 56:55.216
What is that?

56:55.377 --> 56:58.431
That your son was picked up by leftists
posing as soldiers.

56:58.696 --> 57:03.180
Ah, yes. As a matter of fact, there are even
people who think it may have been his idea.

57:04.862 --> 57:06.550
You've gotta be kiddin' me.

57:06.890 --> 57:09.499
He could've done it
to embarrass the government...

57:09.560 --> 57:11.417
to make it look like
they're arresting Americans.

57:11.630 --> 57:13.420
They are arresting Americans.

57:13.481 --> 57:16.002
Or don't David Holloway
and Frank Teruggi count?

57:16.179 --> 57:17.436
Of course they count.

57:18.032 --> 57:21.652
Listen, that reminds me. I heard about them
in Washington, Teruggi and...

57:22.276 --> 57:23.421
They're released, right?

57:23.988 --> 57:24.932
We should speak to them.

57:24.993 --> 57:26.889
-We're seeing David tomorrow.
-We are?

57:28.113 --> 57:28.880
Is that my list?

57:29.633 --> 57:30.224
No.

57:31.651 --> 57:33.834
These are things I'd just
like you to check on, please.

57:35.569 --> 57:36.081
Mmm.

57:38.700 --> 57:40.177
Okay, I'll do my best.

57:41.843 --> 57:43.840
Well, if that's all, I guess
we can get back to work.

57:43.901 --> 57:44.665
No, no.

57:44.726 --> 57:46.442
Just one moment, please.

57:46.503 --> 57:49.266
To be very frank, I know
that in these countries...

57:49.640 --> 57:52.968
the American embassies have agents
that are involved with the local police...

57:53.029 --> 57:54.773
and the military training programs.

57:54.834 --> 57:56.394
Mr. Horman, this case has nothing...

57:56.613 --> 57:58.649
I assume that this case
has something to do with it...

57:58.710 --> 58:02.900
that those sort of operations exist here,
and I don't care how or who runs it...

58:02.961 --> 58:05.577
I just want you to use it
to help find my son.

58:05.857 --> 58:06.968
I assure you, Mr. Horman...

58:07.029 --> 58:08.993
And that's all I have to say
about it right now. Thank you.

58:12.230 --> 58:15.419
Mr. Horman, I noticed you were talking
with a reporter before.

58:15.480 --> 58:17.851
I think it might be better
for the investigation

58:17.912 --> 58:19.558
if you hold off on that for a while.

58:19.986 --> 58:20.843
You know what I mean?

58:22.339 --> 58:24.069
-I'll hold off.
-Good.

58:26.657 --> 58:27.397
Mrs. Horman.

58:28.803 --> 58:29.433
Three, please.

58:29.494 --> 58:32.434
God, I can't believe what you said in there
about that police training program.

58:33.090 --> 58:36.561
I find if you call a spade a spade,
you'll generally get a favourable response.

58:36.622 --> 58:38.598
You can also get dead
with that kind of favourable response.

58:38.659 --> 58:41.309
Well, that's your paranoia, isn't it?
And, of course, Charles's.

58:41.537 --> 58:44.649
-Ed...
-Why didn't you make the list of his friends?

58:45.360 --> 58:47.773
-Are you serious?
-Do I look like I'm joking?

58:48.223 --> 58:51.383
Ed, five minutes
after I give that list to Tower...

58:51.444 --> 58:54.110
those friends would probably
be arrested by the military.

58:54.193 --> 58:56.853
I didn't know Charles
associated with such dangerous people.

58:56.914 --> 59:00.594
We're not criminals, Ed.
Charlie's not a failure.

59:00.655 --> 59:01.461
I didn't say that.

59:01.716 --> 59:03.569
Every time you open your
mouth you imply it.

59:03.630 --> 59:05.363
What I do say is that... if
you stayed where you belong

59:05.424 --> 59:08.113
and paid attention to the basics,
this never would have happened.

59:09.250 --> 59:11.611
And what are the basics...
God, country and Wall Street?

59:11.672 --> 59:14.610
-You know what I mean.
-I know, I know. God bless our way of life

59:14.720 --> 59:18.520
A very good way of life it is,
young lady...

59:18.581 --> 59:20.366
no matter how much people
like you and Charles

59:20.427 --> 59:22.791
try to tear it down with
your sloppy idealism.

59:23.136 --> 59:26.209
I can no longer abide
the young people of our country...

59:26.270 --> 59:28.441
who live off their parents
and the fat of the land...

59:28.709 --> 59:32.018
and then they find nothing better to do
than whine and complain!

59:32.616 --> 59:35.346
-Is that your image of Charlie and me?
-Yes.

59:35.706 --> 59:40.273
Ed. How can that be?
We're not freaked out.

59:40.446 --> 59:44.036
We're just two normal,
slightly confused people...

59:44.200 --> 59:47.867
trying to be connected to
the whole damn rotten enchilada.

59:49.519 --> 59:51.706
Screw you then, Mr. Horman!

59:52.043 --> 59:54.519
Why don't you just go back to New York!

59:58.070 --> 59:59.965
You're just messing things up.

01:00:22.477 --> 01:00:23.245
Ed?

01:00:28.027 --> 01:00:29.421
I'm sorry, Ed.

01:00:32.913 --> 01:00:33.977
Are you all right?

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:37.031
I said I'm sorry.

01:00:38.832 --> 01:00:39.952
Oh, shit.

01:00:40.863 --> 01:00:42.690
Always me and my big mouth!

01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:48.649
Frank, you're not asleep yet?

01:00:50.536 --> 01:00:52.530
Stop fucking around. Shit!

01:00:53.064 --> 01:00:54.086
Es genial. No dispares
(It's cool. Don't shoot).

01:00:54.147 --> 01:00:55.219
-David 'Ol-avai'?

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.343
Holloway.

01:00:56.404 --> 01:00:58.150
Donde esta Frank Teruggi?
(Where is Frank Teruggi?)

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.354
Frank?

01:01:09.906 --> 01:01:10.795
Holy shit.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:13.096
What's going on?

01:01:13.157 --> 01:01:14.011
Hey, be cool.

01:01:15.145 --> 01:01:16.232
What is this?

01:01:16.866 --> 01:01:18.636
Get your hands off me, asshole.
What the hell is this?

01:01:18.697 --> 01:01:19.773
Stop it. They'll kill ya!

01:01:20.756 --> 01:01:21.831
Bullshit.

01:02:04.361 --> 01:02:06.090
We have the right to call our embassy!

01:02:07.063 --> 01:02:09.759
-American embassy!
-Leave them. They're Americans.

01:02:40.206 --> 01:02:41.246
-Where do you work?
-The Senate.

01:02:42.076 --> 01:02:44.301
-What do you do there?
-I'm a senator.

01:02:46.635 --> 01:02:47.640
Corrientes, 122.

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:50.843
Forty years old.

01:02:54.286 --> 01:02:54.986
Quitate la ropa.
(Take their clothes off).

01:02:55.047 --> 01:02:56.730
Then take these people over there.
(Entonces lleva a estas personas alli).

01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:05.928
They're not gonna hurt us, okay?
Come on.

01:03:21.681 --> 01:03:22.836
We, um...

01:03:24.399 --> 01:03:26.360
never found out what happened. Uh...

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:31.346
There were a lot of rumours
going around about...

01:03:32.626 --> 01:03:35.338
torture and specialists.

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:39.668
-Brazilians.
-You were tortured?

01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:45.230
Oh, uh, no.

01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:47.330
Somebody stepped on my hand.

01:03:51.658 --> 01:03:53.284
They're gonna shoot us,
aren't they, Frank?

01:03:54.144 --> 01:03:57.609
No, I don't think so, David.
They're just trying to scare us, that's all.

01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:00.282
Well, they sure as hell succeeded.

01:04:01.078 --> 01:04:05.040
Come on, David. I can't take you anywhere.
Next time we get arrested, I'm going alone.

01:04:05.434 --> 01:04:06.946
You're really full of shit, Frank.

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.265
Come on.

01:04:12.011 --> 01:04:13.157
David, come on.

01:04:14.025 --> 01:04:16.750
They can't kill us.
Our embassy'll go bananas.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.055
I can't help it.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.906
They're gonna shoot that guy,
aren't they?

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:26.308
Listen, I'll bet you dinner at Arturo's
we'll be out of here by morning.

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:27.994
Come on. What do you say?

01:04:28.867 --> 01:04:29.616
Come on.

01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:33.028
Teruggi?

01:04:34.803 --> 01:04:35.769
Teruggi!

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.017
Looks like you lose, turkey.

01:04:42.156 --> 01:04:43.614
Now be strong, all right?

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.080
As soon as I get out of here,
I'm going to the embassy.

01:04:47.958 --> 01:04:49.973
Remember, you owe me one. Arturo's.

01:04:50.034 --> 01:04:50.769
Vamonos. Vamonos.
(Let's go. Let's go).

01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:53.237
Hold your water, scum bag. I'm coming.

01:05:02.189 --> 01:05:04.117
That's the last time I ever saw Frank.

01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:07.114
They released me the next day.

01:05:08.664 --> 01:05:11.472
The State Department told me
that Frank left here as soon as he got out.

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:12.904
I spoke to Frank's dad in Chicago,

01:05:12.965 --> 01:05:15.288
and Frank never called him
or anyone else we know.

01:05:16.149 --> 01:05:17.439
Maybe he's in hiding too.

01:05:17.689 --> 01:05:20.020
Is that where you think
Charlie is, in hiding?

01:05:20.798 --> 01:05:24.795
-I don't.
-Why do you insist upon rejecting that hope?

01:05:24.856 --> 01:05:26.582
Because it's just not true.

01:05:29.846 --> 01:05:33.659
This, uh, newspaper
that you all worked on.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.894
Could that be the reason
why you were arrested?

01:05:36.662 --> 01:05:38.770
They never even
interrogated me about it.

01:05:39.618 --> 01:05:41.027
Was Charles very active in it?

01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:43.562
Just like the rest of us.

01:05:44.336 --> 01:05:46.980
Sometimes put in 18 hours
a day just to get it out.

01:05:47.389 --> 01:05:51.725
-Charles worked 18 hours a day?
-Sometimes, sure.

01:05:52.977 --> 01:05:55.792
What did you get paid
for those 18 hours?

01:05:56.403 --> 01:05:59.003
A little gratitude, some respect.

01:05:59.287 --> 01:06:02.351
You don't get very many hot dogs
with a little gratitude, do you?

01:06:03.809 --> 01:06:05.164
Let's not start.

01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:10.186
Have you looked for Frank here?

01:06:10.872 --> 01:06:13.631
I looked for him everywhere,
even in the morgue.

01:06:15.526 --> 01:06:16.620
But he's just gone.

01:06:19.787 --> 01:06:20.634
Vanished.

01:06:23.357 --> 01:06:24.611
Sometimes I, uh...

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.942
I get the feeling
we're never gonna see him again.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:36.903
I'm ready, Ed.

01:06:37.466 --> 01:06:38.492
Oh, goodness.

01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:40.370
What?

01:06:43.448 --> 01:06:46.048
-Uh, what are you doing?
-I fix the telephone.

01:06:46.809 --> 01:06:48.600
The telephone works perfectly.

01:06:48.977 --> 01:06:51.084
Now is working better.

01:06:52.714 --> 01:06:56.766
-They fixed mine yesterday.
-How can he be that brazen about it?

01:06:56.827 --> 01:07:00.262
Hello, Ray Tower. How is every little thing
over there in your electric game room?

01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:06.266
Hello? Yes?

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:08.860
What about?

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:12.215
Oh. Uh, thank you. Fine.

01:07:15.646 --> 01:07:16.155
Hmm.

01:07:16.981 --> 01:07:17.741
Who was it?

01:07:18.935 --> 01:07:21.097
The ambassador wants to
see me in the morning.

01:07:21.596 --> 01:07:22.458
Why?

01:07:23.275 --> 01:07:24.002
I don't know.

01:07:34.502 --> 01:07:35.240
Yes, sir.

01:07:35.622 --> 01:07:37.452
Mr. Horman, you can go in now.

01:07:37.513 --> 01:07:38.296
Oh, thank you.

01:07:41.398 --> 01:07:43.160
-Good morning. Beth, I'm sorry.
-Good morning.

01:07:43.221 --> 01:07:46.800
Uh, you can't, uh...
This appointment is only for Mr. Horman.

01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:49.781
Anything I'm about to
hear is for her also.

01:07:50.207 --> 01:07:52.064
It's all right. Send 'em both in.

01:07:54.018 --> 01:07:54.958
Come right in, please.

01:07:55.737 --> 01:07:57.937
-Mr. Ambassador. Good morning.
-Good morning. Have a seat.

01:07:57.998 --> 01:07:59.940
-What happened?
-Just have a seat, please.

01:08:00.001 --> 01:08:02.819
-Yes, what happened, sir?
-Did you find him?

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.481
What?

01:08:04.794 --> 01:08:06.650
Oh, no, not that at all. I'm sorry.

01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:08.179
What is it then?

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.282
Uh, I hear you'd like to discuss
some political questions.

01:08:12.462 --> 01:08:13.098
What?

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.542
You suggested that there
might be some kind of

01:08:15.603 --> 01:08:17.899
American police
assistance program here.

01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:22.622
I'd like you to know nothing of that sort
exists in this country.

01:08:23.636 --> 01:08:26.328
Mr. Ambassador,
I'm not interested in the politics of it.

01:08:26.389 --> 01:08:30.299
I brought it up only because I want you
to use every resource at your command.

01:08:30.999 --> 01:08:32.310
I repeat, Mr. Horman...

01:08:32.948 --> 01:08:36.868
no such operation exists.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.675
I got the clearance for those hospitals
you wanted to visit.

01:08:43.682 --> 01:08:44.819
What about the national stadium?

01:08:45.676 --> 01:08:47.929
-I'm trying, but it's kind of touchy
-Handle it!

01:08:48.202 --> 01:08:49.425
What do you mean, 'it's touchy'?

01:08:50.582 --> 01:08:51.520
Look, gentlemen...

01:08:56.095 --> 01:08:58.439
I know these are bad times;
it's not fun for you people.

01:08:59.513 --> 01:09:01.799
It's certainly not fun
for Beth or me...

01:09:02.243 --> 01:09:03.299
or Charles.

01:09:04.464 --> 01:09:05.857
I know you're doing your best.

01:09:06.502 --> 01:09:08.282
I have to believe that.
That's our only hope.

01:09:08.508 --> 01:09:11.240
But you have
all the machinery on your side.

01:09:11.926 --> 01:09:12.697
Don't you see?

01:09:13.617 --> 01:09:14.990
You have all the connections.

01:09:15.077 --> 01:09:17.314
I'm a middle-aged businessman
from New York City.

01:09:17.603 --> 01:09:20.395
I don't speak one word of Spanish.
Here I am.

01:09:20.475 --> 01:09:22.595
My son may have been shot.

01:09:23.251 --> 01:09:25.032
Maybe he was tortured. Maybe he was...

01:09:25.809 --> 01:09:28.064
Oh, Lord... beaten so badly
that they're keeping him

01:09:28.125 --> 01:09:29.426
until he's well enough to be released.

01:09:29.488 --> 01:09:31.402
I don't know. I don't care.

01:09:35.542 --> 01:09:36.856
Oh, really, I don't care.

01:09:38.318 --> 01:09:39.680
Because what is done...

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.595
is done. I just want you
to reach those people

01:09:42.656 --> 01:09:45.571
and tell them I will take
Charles back in any condition.

01:09:45.631 --> 01:09:47.196
I'm not gonna make a stink.

01:09:47.395 --> 01:09:48.790
I'm not gonna go to the newspapers.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:52.300
You make out any kind of a release form,
I will sign it.

01:09:52.694 --> 01:09:55.009
I will absolve anyone,
everyone of everything.

01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:57.821
I just want my boy back!

01:10:05.136 --> 01:10:07.774
He's the only child I have, sir.

01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:16.063
Did you hear what I said?

01:10:18.558 --> 01:10:20.390
Yes, I did, Mr. Horman.

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:24.120
Oh...

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.058
Come on, Ed. The meeting's over.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.650
I made a fool out of myself.

01:10:38.137 --> 01:10:39.553
Ed, you were great.

01:10:39.614 --> 01:10:43.169
Mr. Horman, don't feel bad, please.
Just try to understand.

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:44.223
There are so many cases.

01:10:44.443 --> 01:10:47.460
They're all so important. This isn't
the only one we're working on.

01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:49.216
This is the only one that I care about.

01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:54.080
You and a lot of other people. I've never
seen so many cables from Washington.

01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:56.866
What kind of pull
do you have up there anyway?

01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:58.360
I'm an American citizen.

01:11:05.463 --> 01:11:06.240
Mr. Horman.

01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:12.106
I'm sorry. Dave McGeary from the consulate,
sir. I've got Beth outside in the car.

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.321
I'll be with you in a moment.

01:11:25.063 --> 01:11:26.830
-You all set?
-No.

01:11:27.185 --> 01:11:31.076
-But let's get it over with. Gracias.
-Thank you. God be with you.

01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:52.048
Where would you like to start?

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.666
I've listed the hospitals
geographically...

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:57.461
and the first stop is St. Anne's.

01:11:57.522 --> 01:12:00.321
-Okay. That's on Avenue Ruiz.
-Yes, I know.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:02.217
Listen, uh,

01:12:03.157 --> 01:12:04.410
if you don't mind my asking...

01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:05.978
what's Christian Science about?

01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:08.188
Faith.

01:12:09.178 --> 01:12:10.265
It's about faith.

01:12:11.562 --> 01:12:12.428
Faith in what?

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:14.711
In truth.

01:12:25.899 --> 01:12:28.283
So there's no one in the register
under the name of Horman?

01:12:28.493 --> 01:12:31.553
-No, sir.
-Have we seen all of the patients?

01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:36.022
Yes, except for los perdidos
-the ones with no names.

01:12:36.230 --> 01:12:38.579
-Well, where are they?
-Below, in the basement.

01:12:39.303 --> 01:12:40.566
I'm sure we don't have him,

01:12:41.078 --> 01:12:43.458
but you can check by yourself.

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:22.095
-I'm very sorry.
-Gracias, senor. (Thanks, sir).

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:24.464
Gracias.
(Thanks).

01:13:31.969 --> 01:13:34.599
-He's not here.
-Gracias. (Thanks).

01:13:49.306 --> 01:13:51.436
Muchas personas vienen aqui todos los dias.
(Many people come here every day).

01:13:52.533 --> 01:13:53.988
Many people come here every day.

01:13:56.006 --> 01:13:57.891
Seguramente, algunos de ellos estan locos.
(Surely, some of them are crazy).

01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:03.354
Uh, several of them
are certainly insane.

01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:07.854
Para eso!
(Stop that!)

01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:10.657
Para eso!
(Stop that!)

01:14:13.413 --> 01:14:15.683
Ahi solamente son los desahuciados.
(There are only the evicted).

01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:18.253
Mr. Horman.

01:14:19.769 --> 01:14:21.795
Sir, these are the incurables here.

01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:27.850
Another one! Another one! Another one!

01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:32.714
Another one! Another one!

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:02.951
Where you goin'?

01:15:03.971 --> 01:15:05.502
You go ahead. I wanna take a walk.

01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:07.764
Ed, it's dangerous.
You don't know your way around.

01:15:07.825 --> 01:15:11.775
Please, I'll catch a cab.
I'll be fine. I... I need the air.

01:15:12.753 --> 01:15:13.915
I'm goin' with ya.

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:18.048
-We're gonna walk.
-Beth, you can't do that.

01:15:18.109 --> 01:15:20.348
It's too dangerous.
Beth, it's too dangerous.

01:15:27.866 --> 01:15:30.477
Charles always used to drive me crazy
when he was little.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.287
Cape Cod, always running
up and down the beach,

01:15:33.348 --> 01:15:34.671
throwing everything into the ocean.

01:15:35.483 --> 01:15:37.314
He still likes to do that.

01:15:39.143 --> 01:15:42.512
I wonder what they're doin'
up on old Cape Cod.

01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:45.961
Now it's out of season. The beach is empty.

01:15:46.022 --> 01:15:47.677
Houses are all boarded up.

01:15:50.319 --> 01:15:51.433
I remember that summer,

01:15:52.161 --> 01:15:52.740
before we were married...

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:53.855
we came to visit

01:15:53.918 --> 01:15:55.359
you and Elizabeth, and you all made us

01:15:55.701 --> 01:15:57.292
sleep in separate bedrooms.

01:15:57.533 --> 01:15:58.258
Yes.

01:15:59.364 --> 01:16:00.793
One night we snuck out of the house...

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.720
went down to the beach to make out.

01:16:03.704 --> 01:16:06.340
There was all this sparkly
phosphorous in the water.

01:16:06.999 --> 01:16:10.669
There was a guy down the beach
listening to the Red Sox game on the radio.

01:16:10.730 --> 01:16:13.035
What else does Charles like to do?

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:15.913
Oh, I don't know.

01:16:16.598 --> 01:16:19.359
He likes to pretend he's a
country-western singer in the shower.

01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:22.163
-Hmm?
-But he's got a terrible voice.

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.333
And he likes to cook corned beef hash
with an egg in it.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.156
-And, of course, he's a star freak.
-A what?

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:34.610
A star freak. He can point out
every constellation up there.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.620
Oh. I never knew that.

01:16:36.681 --> 01:16:39.753
Yeah. Oh! And he loves
to make love on Sunday mornings.

01:16:40.924 --> 01:16:42.713
In fact, he's a regular sex maniac.

01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:46.226
I really don't want
to hear about your...

01:16:47.964 --> 01:16:48.990
bedroom antics.

01:16:49.246 --> 01:16:50.263
-Come on.
-I rea...

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.145
Las papas.
(Potatoes).

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.173
That's Frank Teruggi.

01:17:08.004 --> 01:17:09.407
-You're not bad.
-Compaero... (Companion...)

01:17:09.468 --> 01:17:11.272
if you have two houses, the
state takes one house,

01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:12.676
gives it to the man who has no house.

01:17:12.737 --> 01:17:13.823
You get to keep one house.

01:17:14.545 --> 01:17:15.769
Si. Por supuesto.
(Yes, of course).

01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:17.515
If you have two cars, the
state takes one car,

01:17:17.576 --> 01:17:19.812
gives it to the man who has no
car, you get to keep one car.

01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:21.559
Eso es bueno, si.
(That's good, yes).

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.482
If you have two chickens, the
state takes one chicken,

01:17:23.543 --> 01:17:25.028
gives it to the man
who has no chicken...

01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:26.262
you get to keep one chicken.

01:17:28.489 --> 01:17:30.569
What's the matter? Companero,
I thought you understood our revolution.

01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:32.648
I have two chickens.

01:17:34.152 --> 01:17:35.639
That's the whole story.

01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.367
I have two cameras.

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:42.423
Women and children first.

01:17:42.484 --> 01:17:44.076
We got diapers in here.

01:17:50.428 --> 01:17:53.299
What is this supposed to be about?
Why did you make this?

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.544
Oh, just for fun.

01:17:54.731 --> 01:17:57.289
It was a party for Terry. She
was to leave the next Sunday.

01:17:57.350 --> 01:18:00.067
You ever been to Vina?
That's where these come from.

01:18:00.128 --> 01:18:02.035
That's an idea.
We should take her to the beach.

01:18:02.665 --> 01:18:03.472
Yeah!

01:18:03.691 --> 01:18:05.949
-It's a great beach.
-I have to be back in New York in three days.

01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:06.931
We'll go tomorrow.

01:18:07.444 --> 01:18:09.840
I can't. I gotta renew my visa.
Y'all go.

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:11.852
-Next day.
-Really, you shouldn't miss it.

01:18:11.913 --> 01:18:13.948
-Really?
-Go tomorrow.

01:18:14.009 --> 01:18:16.582
Day trip. Bring your camera.
Bring your cameras.

01:18:16.643 --> 01:18:17.359
Sure.

01:18:18.074 --> 01:18:20.550
-I'll stay home.
-That's all.

01:18:20.819 --> 01:18:23.698
Believe us, sir.
Your son is not what they told you.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:26.982
-How do you know that, Silvio?
-He's a nice guy. He's sincere.

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:29.773
Hard worker, but he's
a political neophyte.

01:18:30.438 --> 01:18:31.500
He's terrified of violence.

01:18:31.777 --> 01:18:32.682
What's wrong with that?

01:18:33.072 --> 01:18:34.362
I'm not knocking him, sir.

01:18:34.946 --> 01:18:37.657
I like Charlie,
and I've got my fingers crossed.

01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:40.437
Why did you go into hiding?

01:18:41.249 --> 01:18:42.502
I knew they would pick me up.

01:18:42.831 --> 01:18:43.974
Why? What had you done?

01:18:44.183 --> 01:18:46.521
You Americans, you always assume

01:18:46.584 --> 01:18:49.273
you must do something
before you can be arrested.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:50.863
Isn't that the way it usually works?

01:18:51.219 --> 01:18:52.757
Not here, Mr. Horman.

01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:54.143
It's crazy,

01:18:54.395 --> 01:18:56.283
Charlie being arrested by them...

01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:58.990
when some people even thought
he was from the C.I.A.

01:18:59.453 --> 01:19:00.220
What?

01:19:00.746 --> 01:19:02.977
You know. Charlie was
always asking questions,

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:04.476
taking notes on everything.

01:19:05.586 --> 01:19:06.402
I warned him.

01:19:07.344 --> 01:19:07.942
And?

01:19:08.591 --> 01:19:10.858
He just laughed and took note.

01:19:14.485 --> 01:19:15.634
He will come back, Beth,

01:19:16.282 --> 01:19:17.583
just as Carlos has.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.868
This is all of them, Colonel?

01:19:27.708 --> 01:19:28.737
Hmm?

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:33.264
One form for each prisoner
who was held and then released.

01:19:33.325 --> 01:19:34.276
But none for my son?

01:19:34.633 --> 01:19:36.653
That means that he was not here.

01:19:38.136 --> 01:19:40.030
Why don't you come
and check for yourself, Mr. Horman?

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:41.937
I thought Frank Teruggi was released.

01:19:42.663 --> 01:19:43.130
Who?

01:19:43.403 --> 01:19:46.506
Teruggi, the man who was arrested
with David Holloway.

01:19:46.656 --> 01:19:47.695
There is no release from here.

01:19:48.474 --> 01:19:50.556
Very sorry. I don't recall his name.

01:19:51.646 --> 01:19:52.362
Shall we?

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.604
Attention.

01:20:09.914 --> 01:20:11.334
Your attention.

01:20:11.670 --> 01:20:15.120
We're going to permit this American,
who is looking for his son...

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:16.726
to speak here.

01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:19.399
Keep quiet and pay attention.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.020
Go ahead, Mr. Horman.

01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:41.286
I... I can't seem to. You go ahead.
You just start it.

01:20:42.886 --> 01:20:44.086
Charlie,

01:20:45.063 --> 01:20:46.246
this is Beth.

01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:50.976
I'm here with your dad, Charlie...

01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:54.286
and the American consul.

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:59.036
So, if you can hear me...

01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:04.242
please come out
so we can take you home.

01:21:18.617 --> 01:21:20.139
Charles Horman...

01:21:21.786 --> 01:21:24.316
this is your father Edmund.

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:30.652
I'm here in the hope
that you can hear me.

01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:45.199
-Charles.
-Charles.

01:21:46.971 --> 01:21:48.658
Do you remember when we...

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:51.979
took that trip together
across country from...

01:21:52.695 --> 01:21:54.022
L.A. to New York?

01:21:58.570 --> 01:21:59.679
Just the two of us.

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:12.358
That's him.

01:22:13.058 --> 01:22:14.382
Oh, my God, that's him!

01:22:14.967 --> 01:22:18.380
-No, it's not. It's not him, Ed.
-Charles! Charles!

01:22:18.736 --> 01:22:21.084
It's not him. It's not him, Ed.

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:26.788
My father cannot come here.

01:22:27.739 --> 01:22:31.685
But how about some ice cream
with my dinner, Colonel Espinoza?

01:22:35.432 --> 01:22:38.140
But, Ambassador,
my friends have talked to refugees...

01:22:38.201 --> 01:22:41.036
in the Swedish, Mexican
and French embassies.

01:22:41.230 --> 01:22:44.485
However, the man they must see
is here in your embassy.

01:22:44.546 --> 01:22:47.044
All these people
have come here looking for protection.

01:22:47.466 --> 01:22:51.254
-I am responsible for their lives.
-Oh, come on. Look at them.

01:22:52.073 --> 01:22:53.650
Do they look like assassins?

01:22:56.378 --> 01:22:59.398
-Yes, tell them there's no problem.
-Beth. Mr. Horman.

01:22:59.630 --> 01:23:01.831
Okay, Kate. This way.

01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:16.499
You must remember,
Mr. Paris is a desperate man.

01:23:25.330 --> 01:23:28.723
-How many refugees have you got here?
-Oh, about 800, 900.

01:23:44.321 --> 01:23:47.070
There were four of them in Lutz's office.

01:23:47.427 --> 01:23:50.445
The general, of course,
the colonel, my friend..

01:23:50.506 --> 01:23:52.598
who told me of this, and the American.

01:23:52.659 --> 01:23:53.707
You mean the prisoner?

01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:57.750
The American officer.
No, the prisoner was in the next room.

01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:00.450
-Was he alive?
-More or less.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.190
What do you mean, 'more or less'?

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:06.642
-I'm only telling you what I heard.
-What the hell does 'more or less' mean?

01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:11.548
Well, apparently he had been roughed up
during interrogation.

01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:13.221
How badly?

01:24:13.734 --> 01:24:15.240
I don't know. I wasn't there.

01:24:15.301 --> 01:24:16.312
Your friend was?

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:19.069
My former friend, Mr. Horman.

01:24:19.636 --> 01:24:21.940
Nobody in this regime
is my friend any longer.

01:24:22.050 --> 01:24:24.724
All right. Who was
the American officer in the room?

01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:26.335
Well, who knows?

01:24:27.328 --> 01:24:28.851
The ministry is full of them.

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.259
Their Milgroup office is just
down the hall from the general,

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.320
and this is a scoop for you.

01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:36.520
Oh, Paris, everyone knows that.

01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:40.230
Did they mention the prisoner?
Did they call the prisoner by name?

01:24:41.194 --> 01:24:42.907
-Horseman?
-Horman?

01:24:43.936 --> 01:24:44.627
Maybe.

01:24:45.212 --> 01:24:47.120
Horman, sure. Horman.

01:24:47.997 --> 01:24:50.017
If I had been there, I
would know for sure.

01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:54.926
I am an honour graduate
of your police academy in Washington.

01:24:55.826 --> 01:24:56.993
I like America.

01:24:57.428 --> 01:25:00.685
There it is more democratic,
and someday I hope to...

01:25:00.772 --> 01:25:06.409
Paris, please. Just tell them what the
General Lutz said about the prisoner.

01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:08.551
-Who is Lutz?
-He's the...

01:25:08.612 --> 01:25:11.291
He's the head of
the local version of the C.I.A.

01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:14.404
He said the man must disappear.

01:25:15.092 --> 01:25:16.756
Oh, my God. Why?

01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:18.436
He knew too much.

01:25:18.789 --> 01:25:19.665
About what?

01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:21.143
I don't know.

01:25:22.112 --> 01:25:26.004
But only a few very important people have
been detained at the Ministry of Defence...

01:25:26.324 --> 01:25:29.080
and most of them were killed
shortly after interrogation.

01:25:29.141 --> 01:25:32.644
-The others were sent to camps.
-What happened to my son?

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:35.960
They drove him back to the stadium.

01:25:38.049 --> 01:25:40.903
How can you order
the disappearance of an American?

01:25:40.964 --> 01:25:43.988
-I didn't order his disappearance!
-Ed, he didn't order his disappearance.

01:25:44.690 --> 01:25:47.220
Listen. I'm a police officer,
but I'm not a murderer.

01:25:47.335 --> 01:25:49.110
Paris, we know you're a good man...

01:25:49.171 --> 01:25:51.552
I have worked now
for many different governments.

01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:55.101
Some, their politics I agreed with.
Others, not so much.

01:25:56.787 --> 01:25:59.687
I have worked now
for the junta for two weeks...

01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:01.935
but these are Nazis.

01:26:04.172 --> 01:26:05.981
They are destroying in just a few weeks

01:26:06.042 --> 01:26:08.381
everything that was beautiful
about this country.

01:26:09.118 --> 01:26:13.389
What we need to know is,
can they order an American to disappear...

01:26:13.450 --> 01:26:15.985
without consulting the Americans first?

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.563
Oh, no, no. No, they wouldn't...
they wouldn't dare.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.921
How can I verify that?

01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:26.151
You can't.

01:26:29.633 --> 01:26:31.292
What's gonna happen to all these people?

01:26:31.671 --> 01:26:34.104
Safe for the moment.
Later, they'll be deported.

01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:36.459
What about Paris?

01:26:37.337 --> 01:26:39.454
He's not even close to
getting out of here.

01:26:40.183 --> 01:26:41.187
Why does he talk?

01:26:41.751 --> 01:26:44.198
If he gets enough press,
they won't knock him off.

01:26:44.259 --> 01:26:45.093
They won't dare to.

01:26:45.757 --> 01:26:47.620
It's like the old switch-hitting game.

01:26:47.730 --> 01:26:49.044
Only way to survive.

01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:56.081
Do you think that prisoner
in the other room was Charles?

01:26:58.013 --> 01:26:58.951
What do you think?

01:27:01.810 --> 01:27:03.780
What could Charles know
that's so important?

01:27:03.986 --> 01:27:05.625
Probably what he discovered in Vina.

01:27:06.592 --> 01:27:07.911
-You say he kept notes.
-Uh-huh.

01:27:07.972 --> 01:27:09.663
-You still have 'em?
-Yeah, at the hotel.

01:27:29.867 --> 01:27:33.262
-Stop it! Stop it!
-Ed, what are you doing? Stop!

01:27:33.323 --> 01:27:35.923
-Stop, Mr. Horman.
-Stop it! Stop it!

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.170
Good God!

01:27:38.410 --> 01:27:39.299
Shut this.

01:27:41.426 --> 01:27:43.940
What the hell were you trying to do?
Get us all killed?

01:27:44.001 --> 01:27:44.659
I'm sorry.

01:27:45.393 --> 01:27:46.729
I am just beginning to get...

01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:49.319
awfully sick and tired of all of this..

01:27:49.888 --> 01:27:50.648
Shit!

01:27:52.073 --> 01:27:55.655
I saw your son do almost
the same damn, dumb thing.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:57.438
He did that?

01:28:01.123 --> 01:28:03.670
'And during the barbecue,
Ray Tower arrived

01:28:03.819 --> 01:28:05.909
'Later he drove us back to Santiago.

01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:10.320
Trip uneventful, aside roadblock incident,
detailed page 12.'

01:28:10.599 --> 01:28:12.101
Ray Tower drove 'em back?

01:28:12.214 --> 01:28:14.510
'Ray Tower arrived later.
He drove us back to Santiago.'

01:28:14.571 --> 01:28:17.649
-Hmm.
-Well, what? Does that mean something?

01:28:21.576 --> 01:28:25.360
Um, would you go back
to where they first meet Babcock?

01:28:25.472 --> 01:28:28.166
'May I borrow
that paper if you're through?'

01:28:28.227 --> 01:28:32.078
'You'd do better to ask in English.'

01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:33.760
You're French?

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.891
Excuse me, Beth.
Would you skip ahead to why he was there?

01:28:37.952 --> 01:28:41.456
-What are you doing down here?
-The navy sent me down to do a job.

01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:43.669
She's done.

01:28:43.927 --> 01:28:46.280
You have any idea how long
we'll be stuck here in Vina?

01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:47.245
About a week.

01:28:47.772 --> 01:28:50.751
Don't worry. Everything's all right.
The coup went very smoothly.

01:28:50.836 --> 01:28:52.038
You're completely safe.

01:28:52.875 --> 01:28:54.620
Was it planned very far in advance?

01:28:55.655 --> 01:28:59.450
Terry, does a bear shit in the woods?

01:29:00.361 --> 01:29:02.930
Now, will the United States
recognize the new government?

01:29:03.303 --> 01:29:05.173
Oh, I don't know.
That's up to the politicians.

01:29:05.234 --> 01:29:06.692
'Red-haired woman appeared edgy.

01:29:07.318 --> 01:29:08.912
Babcock stopped talking.'

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.596
Was it Babcock
who introduced them to Patrick?

01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:13.678
No, Charlie introduced himself.

01:29:14.398 --> 01:29:15.770
'The next day in the lobby... '

01:29:15.831 --> 01:29:17.558
-Excuse me, Colonel.
-Well...

01:29:17.647 --> 01:29:19.397
'Well, hello there.

01:29:19.458 --> 01:29:21.518
'What are you doing
in this neck of the woods?'

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.869
'My name is Charles Horman.
This is my friend, Terry Simon.'

01:29:25.256 --> 01:29:28.581
I explained that we'd come for one day
and got stuck by the coup.'

01:29:29.156 --> 01:29:32.169
Oh, you'll be here a while.
The roads are closed.

01:29:32.230 --> 01:29:34.473
Yeah. What's happening in the capital?

01:29:36.783 --> 01:29:40.944
The, uh, military's doing search-and-destroy
missions, just like in Vietnam.

01:29:41.230 --> 01:29:43.431
There are bodies everywhere.
It's a royal mess.

01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:46.766
Well, how long before you think
the roads are open?

01:29:47.816 --> 01:29:48.855
I don't know.

01:29:49.294 --> 01:29:51.970
But, uh, give me your room number.
I'll keep you posted.

01:29:52.548 --> 01:29:53.454
I'd appreciate it.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.303
'I'm terribly anxious about Beth.'

01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:14.943
'Next morning Babcock
was sitting in lobby

01:30:15.004 --> 01:30:17.059
with carton of Kents and
without lady friend.'

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:18.713
Hey, how's it going?

01:30:19.299 --> 01:30:20.788
Can't complain. Yourself?

01:30:22.193 --> 01:30:23.108
I complain.

01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:24.821
Uh-oh.

01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:28.539
Where you going when you leave?

01:30:29.376 --> 01:30:30.590
Probably Bolivia.

01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:33.562
Bolivia is beautiful. You'll love it.

01:30:33.975 --> 01:30:35.122
That's what I hear.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.642
So are you.

01:30:38.994 --> 01:30:41.522
Of course, they have
their problems too, but...

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.748
If they've got problems,
you'll probably go there next.

01:30:46.150 --> 01:30:47.915
I know I'll go there next.

01:30:51.531 --> 01:30:52.708
Sherlock, tell me something.

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:56.055
What would a naval engineer
be doing in Bolivia...

01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:58.595
'One of two land locked
countries in Latin America?'

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:03.756
-Right.
-Sir, any news?

01:31:03.922 --> 01:31:05.331
So far nothing. If I were you,

01:31:05.392 --> 01:31:07.980
I wouldn't be so anxious to be there.
It is a real battlefield.

01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.895
But, sir...

01:31:11.772 --> 01:31:14.110
Hey, look, I have to meet somebody upstairs.

01:31:14.171 --> 01:31:16.850
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
Why don't you two come with me?

01:31:16.911 --> 01:31:19.362
I know a place where you can
radio your parents in the U.S.

01:31:19.423 --> 01:31:20.518
and tell them you're safe. Huh?

01:31:20.807 --> 01:31:21.623
Couple of minutes.

01:31:21.749 --> 01:31:24.677
I know I'm safe. It's my
wife I'm worried about.

01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:28.040
Colonel, you mind
if I ask you a question?

01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:29.869
Certainly. Go ahead.

01:31:30.536 --> 01:31:31.979
How do you feel about the coup?

01:31:32.335 --> 01:31:33.249
Very good.

01:31:33.650 --> 01:31:35.186
I've been in a lot of, um...

01:31:36.271 --> 01:31:38.576
frustrating situations before this.

01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:41.450
I was in Key West waiting
for the Bay of Pigs.

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:44.145
I even took an advanced scuba course
for that invasion.

01:31:44.690 --> 01:31:47.214
If Kennedy had provided
decent air cover,

01:31:47.381 --> 01:31:49.934
proper military support there...

01:31:49.995 --> 01:31:51.878
we wouldn't be having
these problems here.

01:31:53.389 --> 01:31:55.443
'We arrived at the home of Paul Baker...

01:31:55.504 --> 01:31:57.706
where a naval mission radio
was installed.'

01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:02.480
Yeah, we received a cable
through Panama on September... 14.

01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:04.570
'After radioing Dad, Patrick offered...

01:32:04.631 --> 01:32:08.261
'to arrange a ride to Santiago
with Captain Ray Tower, U.S.N...

01:32:08.352 --> 01:32:11.552
who's returning there
with Herbert Porterfield.'

01:32:11.753 --> 01:32:13.170
And the next day they came back.

01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:18.363
Yeah. 'On September 15. Checked out of
hotel, and Patrick drove us to his house...'

01:32:18.424 --> 01:32:20.730
for, quote, going away,
unquote barbecue.'

01:32:20.797 --> 01:32:22.708
I was saying to Terry
you're welcome to stay with us.

01:32:22.769 --> 01:32:24.909
We have an extra room,
and if the hotel's too expensive...

01:32:25.992 --> 01:32:28.074
No, that's very nice of you,
but thanks anyway.

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:30.762
-We have a Ping-Pong table too.
-Ping-Pong?

01:32:30.823 --> 01:32:32.758
-Yes.
-No. No, thanks.

01:32:34.110 --> 01:32:36.369
So you guys friendly
with the local military down here?

01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:37.383
Oh, some.

01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:42.024
I took Admiral Huidobro to the
United States to buy arms last July.

01:32:42.236 --> 01:32:43.558
Military's all right,

01:32:43.619 --> 01:32:46.055
but the truck drivers are the
real heroes of this thing.

01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:49.660
They wanna talk to Babcock
again this afternoon.

01:32:50.125 --> 01:32:52.929
'Because we were Americans,
they considered us automatic allies...

01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:54.660
in anything the U.S. might do.'

01:32:54.721 --> 01:32:56.392
The guy had to be a hamburger
to miss with a rocket.

01:32:57.533 --> 01:32:59.990
Charlie, you determined to go back?

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:00.614
Mm-hmm.

01:33:01.547 --> 01:33:03.043
Do you know about the rebels?

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:07.430
Ray Tower is number two
on their hit list.

01:33:08.423 --> 01:33:09.764
I wouldn't ride with him.

01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:13.189
-I wanna see my wife. Thanks, anyway.
-# My whole world #

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:16.833
# Is falling down Falling down #

01:33:16.906 --> 01:33:18.933
-Hello, Ray.
-Hi, Pat.

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:23.973
Well, here's your chauffeur.
Ray Tower, Charlie Horman.

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.100
-Pleased to meet you, Charlie.
-Nice to meet you.

01:33:26.363 --> 01:33:30.030
So the boss of Milgroup
and the senior political officer...

01:33:30.091 --> 01:33:32.820
both happened to be in Vina
when the coup started.

01:33:35.328 --> 01:33:38.870
'We came down to do a job and it's done.'
What do you suppose Babcock meant by that?

01:33:39.083 --> 01:33:41.643
Most people think the coup
was prepared in Vina.

01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:45.246
Now, if we weren't involved in the coup...

01:33:45.975 --> 01:33:49.109
whatever Charlie saw
or heard down there is meaningless.

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:50.986
But if we were,

01:33:51.653 --> 01:33:55.068
it still doesn't mean much,
but it could be significant.

01:33:55.526 --> 01:33:58.510
At least enough for somebody
to take a look at his jacket.

01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:01.277
-What? His what?
-Oh, his record.

01:34:01.338 --> 01:34:04.360
They keep a file on every
American national living down here.

01:34:05.517 --> 01:34:09.855
So if somebody decided to review that file
and found that Charlie worked for FIN...

01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.240
they might conclude that he was a guy
that was well worth watching.

01:34:13.768 --> 01:34:15.017
Do you think that's what happened?

01:34:16.336 --> 01:34:17.595
It seems possible.

01:34:23.698 --> 01:34:25.085
Doesn't look so good, does it?

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:32.912
Okay, we're all set.
This gentleman is gonna take us through.

01:34:32.973 --> 01:34:33.692
Buenos dias.
(Good day).

01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:42.000
Hace mucho frio ahi abajo.
(It is very cold down here).

01:34:42.561 --> 01:34:43.250
Si.

01:34:43.938 --> 01:34:46.111
He says it's quite cold down here.
You better put on your sweater.

01:34:53.786 --> 01:34:55.232
I think you should wait upstairs.

01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.206
Todos ellos han sido identificados.
(All of these have been identified).

01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:59.812
These have all been identified.

01:35:01.389 --> 01:35:02.319
This way.

01:35:09.659 --> 01:35:10.972
Come. Come.

01:35:11.306 --> 01:35:13.480
Estos tambien han sido identificados.
(These have also been identified).

01:35:14.489 --> 01:35:16.368
These, too, have all
been identified as well.

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.910
Estos tambien han sido identificados.
(These have also been identified).

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:31.681
These, too, all identified.

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.367
Estos no han sido identificados.
(These have not been identified).

01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:42.460
The identities of these
have yet to be determined.

01:36:24.236 --> 01:36:24.881
Ed.

01:36:35.583 --> 01:36:36.490
Who is he?

01:36:38.549 --> 01:36:39.700
Frank Teruggi.

01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:43.771
Jesus Christ almighty!

01:36:43.832 --> 01:36:45.932
Come on. Let's get her out of here.

01:36:46.022 --> 01:36:47.591
Get your hands off me!

01:36:47.962 --> 01:36:49.993
I'm not leaving here until I'm
done looking for my husband.

01:36:51.053 --> 01:36:52.951
-Ed, come on. Give me a hand.
-You heard what she said.

01:37:06.019 --> 01:37:10.266
Gentlemen, please.
I want you to answer me.

01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:12.650
Si. Si.
(Yes. Yes).

01:37:16.431 --> 01:37:20.641
Why wasn't the body discovered
until now? What took so long?

01:37:21.630 --> 01:37:22.655
Porque tardaron tanto
(Because they took so long)

01:37:22.716 --> 01:37:24.202
en descubrir el cadaver?
(to discover the cadaver?)

01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:31.750
What kind of world is this?

01:37:34.155 --> 01:37:35.575
You sound just like Charlie.

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:44.795
Okay.

01:37:46.457 --> 01:37:48.007
It appears that, uh...

01:37:48.068 --> 01:37:51.820
Mr. Teruggi was picked up for a curfew
violation and detained at the stadium...

01:37:51.881 --> 01:37:52.962
and then released.

01:37:53.976 --> 01:37:56.215
And then the carabineros
found him later that night,

01:37:56.377 --> 01:37:57.428
dead on the street.

01:37:58.130 --> 01:38:00.830
Why did the State Department
tell me that he'd left the country?

01:38:01.943 --> 01:38:02.570
I...

01:38:04.503 --> 01:38:07.986
Most likely some, uh, screw-up
at local immigration.

01:38:11.203 --> 01:38:13.540
Phil, I'm not gonna leave this
country till I find my son,

01:38:13.794 --> 01:38:14.953
alive or dead.

01:38:16.312 --> 01:38:18.336
Uh, what? No, it's just that...

01:38:19.898 --> 01:38:23.693
every new turn seems to lead us
right back to the beginning, you know?

01:38:24.469 --> 01:38:26.008
Like we're going in circles.

01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:28.177
We're going...

01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:29.970
We're going in circles! Elizabeth.

01:38:30.794 --> 01:38:33.778
Can you... Oh, yeah. Okay.
Yes, that's better, dear.

01:38:34.343 --> 01:38:36.902
What? No! I'm, uh, fine.

01:38:36.963 --> 01:38:39.422
I'm just... I'm just pooped, that's all.

01:38:40.389 --> 01:38:42.949
Beth? Yeah, she's all right.

01:38:43.959 --> 01:38:44.672
What?

01:38:45.752 --> 01:38:47.539
Yes. Yes, dear, I will.

01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:48.806
And you too.

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:51.507
God bless you, Liz.

01:39:20.435 --> 01:39:21.290
Earthquake.

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:31.591
-Ed, not the elevator!
-Oh.

01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:42.620
Don't stay in the windows. It's dangerous!

01:39:42.681 --> 01:39:45.325
Senores, no se queden en las ventanas!
(Sirs, do not stay in the windows!)

01:39:45.386 --> 01:39:46.381
Es peligroso!
(It is dangerous).

01:39:47.771 --> 01:39:50.240
Don't stay in the window. It's dangerous.

01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:55.325
Please, be calm. The hotel is
earthquake-proof. No need for alarm!

01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:58.797
You can't go outside. It's curfew!

01:40:00.382 --> 01:40:04.162
Hey, you! Don't go out!
Curfew! Please, don't.

01:40:05.673 --> 01:40:07.064
Go back to your...

01:40:15.136 --> 01:40:16.689
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:19.525
please go back to your rooms.

01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:21.804
There is no more danger.

01:40:23.324 --> 01:40:26.044
Por favor, vuelvan a sus habitaciones.
(Please, go back to your rooms).

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:27.766
It's all right. I don't mind.

01:40:31.973 --> 01:40:32.880
You wanna go up?

01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:35.688
I'm still tryin' to come down.

01:40:36.353 --> 01:40:37.227
Beth...

01:40:39.251 --> 01:40:41.593
how 'bout a drink, hmm? Might
make you sleep better. All right?

01:40:41.654 --> 01:40:43.047
-Yeah. But not in the bar.

01:40:50.796 --> 01:40:52.198
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:55.286
-A la vida. (To life).
-A la... (To...)

01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:57.211
-To life.
-Oh.

01:40:57.272 --> 01:40:58.668
Charlie and I always say that.

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.007
Now, um...

01:41:07.919 --> 01:41:09.837
-I owe you an apology.
-No, you don't.

01:41:09.898 --> 01:41:10.927
No, no, no, no.

01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:15.920
Well, for a long time now
I've sold you short...

01:41:16.635 --> 01:41:17.342
both of you.

01:41:18.263 --> 01:41:20.918
I don't really know why,
unless it's because I'm getting old...

01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:23.471
and I'm very stubborn.

01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:26.572
-Why don't you sit over here?
-I...

01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:37.270
This past week, I've felt like, uh...

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.220
my heart has just been torn out of me.

01:41:42.699 --> 01:41:43.568
It's okay.

01:41:47.383 --> 01:41:48.837
I feel very guilty.

01:41:49.293 --> 01:41:51.680
Ed, Charlie always says
guilt is like fear...

01:41:51.741 --> 01:41:53.870
it's given to us for
survival, not destruction.

01:41:55.536 --> 01:41:56.497
Mm-hmm.

01:42:00.385 --> 01:42:01.307
Beth, for what it's worth,

01:42:01.368 --> 01:42:04.074
I think you're one of he most
courageous people I have ever met.

01:42:05.386 --> 01:42:05.940
I mean it.

01:42:11.333 --> 01:42:12.099
Thank you.

01:42:18.393 --> 01:42:19.450
You think he's dead?

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.480
I don't know.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.720
No. No, I don't...

01:42:30.166 --> 01:42:31.156
think he's dead.

01:42:33.289 --> 01:42:35.041
But that's not how
you really feel, is it?

01:42:38.557 --> 01:42:41.045
-I spoke to Elizabeth tonight.
-And?

01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:43.779
Well, she was speaking
again with some people

01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.558
from the Ford Foundation in New York.

01:42:45.619 --> 01:42:48.820
They think we should
contact, um, Peter Cooke.

01:42:49.154 --> 01:42:50.820
He runs their office here.

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:53.961
-Do you mind if I skip that one?
-No.

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.166
You kids love each other
very much, don't you?

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.809
I'm very sorry, sir, but...

01:43:06.935 --> 01:43:09.740
Mr. Cooke is out of the
country until Monday.

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:12.080
-Oh.
-Can I be of some help?

01:43:13.050 --> 01:43:16.410
Well, I was just paying
a courtesy call on Mr. Cooke.

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:19.432
-You're Mr. Horman, aren't you?
-Mm-hmm.

01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:23.825
Um, why don't you come inside
and we can talk for a while?

01:43:24.690 --> 01:43:27.699
-Well, I, uh...
-Mr. Horman, please come in.

01:43:34.237 --> 01:43:38.220
Hi, I'm Peter Chernin.
I'm an economic adviser with the foundation.

01:43:38.332 --> 01:43:40.962
-Oh.
-Would you come with me for a moment?

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:41.705
Sure.

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:48.581
Please, take a seat.

01:44:03.923 --> 01:44:05.731
I have a friend I play golf with.

01:44:06.882 --> 01:44:08.664
I won't identify him except to say

01:44:08.725 --> 01:44:11.101
that he works for an
English-speaking embassy here...

01:44:12.173 --> 01:44:15.390
and he's close to someone
who has good contacts with the military.

01:44:17.973 --> 01:44:19.956
He thinks your son was executed

01:44:20.017 --> 01:44:22.839
in the national stadium
on September 19.

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:31.390
That was nearly a month ago.

01:44:31.451 --> 01:44:32.087
Yes.

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.080
Could I, uh...

01:44:41.849 --> 01:44:44.633
speak to your friend or his contact?

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:48.759
No, I'm afraid not.
These are very dangerous times.

01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:51.110
I'll go anywhere, in anyway.

01:44:51.210 --> 01:44:54.298
You can tie my hands.
You can blindfold me. You can...

01:44:54.663 --> 01:44:55.558
I'm sorry.

01:44:56.304 --> 01:44:58.174
I am sorry, but I can't do that.

01:45:10.013 --> 01:45:11.690
I probably shouldn't even have told you.

01:45:15.353 --> 01:45:18.576
This is a terrible, terrible tragedy.

01:45:21.038 --> 01:45:22.469
Just give me a name.

01:45:23.963 --> 01:45:24.776
Please.

01:45:25.826 --> 01:45:26.503
Just...

01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:37.958
Well, that's all right. I understand.

01:45:40.107 --> 01:45:41.204
Thank you for telling me.

01:45:42.253 --> 01:45:42.873
So...

01:46:11.103 --> 01:46:14.464
Ed. Ed. The ambassador
is waiting for you in the ballroom.

01:46:16.291 --> 01:46:19.700
We've been trying to reach you all morning.
I think we may have some good news for you.

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:20.995
What would that be?

01:46:22.099 --> 01:46:25.231
That my son was executed in the stadium
three days after his arrest?

01:46:26.599 --> 01:46:29.922
Wait. Who told you that?
Ed, wait a second.

01:46:30.329 --> 01:46:31.907
Oh, good, Consul, you found him.

01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:34.765
Mr. Horman, this is Mr. Samuel Cross.

01:46:36.343 --> 01:46:39.296
Gentlemen, perhaps we'd be
more comfortable over here.

01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:43.528
Mr. Cross is a journalist with good access
to left-wing circles down here...

01:46:44.766 --> 01:46:47.981
and he's dug up some interesting
information about your son.

01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:52.888
I believe that your son's alive
and well, Mr. Horman.

01:46:53.679 --> 01:46:57.417
Captain Tower asked me to make inquiries
about Charles's whereabouts.

01:46:57.930 --> 01:47:01.205
I spoke with a guy who's currently
helping political refugees escape.

01:47:01.670 --> 01:47:04.370
He told me his organization
has secured credentials...

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:06.313
for three Americans to leave Santiago.

01:47:06.810 --> 01:47:08.067
One of them was your son.

01:47:10.437 --> 01:47:12.615
-Where is he?
-He's in the north.

01:47:12.923 --> 01:47:15.623
He should be out of the country
sometime next week.

01:47:16.850 --> 01:47:18.077
Can I contact him?

01:47:18.576 --> 01:47:20.026
No, I'm afraid you can't.

01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:22.889
But I'll lay odds he's home
in New York before you are.

01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:25.327
-Will you please get him out of here.
-Mr. Hor...

01:47:25.388 --> 01:47:29.246
Now, I said please get him out of here.
I wanna speak to the two of you alone.

01:47:29.307 --> 01:47:30.840
Mr. Cross, thank you very much.

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.810
Mr. Horman has some new information
of his own, Mr. Ambassador...

01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:35.267
and I'll check it out right away.

01:47:35.328 --> 01:47:37.492
Yes, you do that.
You call General Lutz.

01:47:40.610 --> 01:47:43.536
I have reason to believe that my son
was killed by the military.

01:47:43.597 --> 01:47:45.259
-Where'd you hear that?
-I do not think...

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.442
that they would dare
do a thing like that...

01:47:47.503 --> 01:47:50.350
unless an American official
cosigned a kill order.

01:47:50.773 --> 01:47:52.282
Don't you think
that's a hell of a statement...

01:47:52.343 --> 01:47:55.368
especially considering we're here
to protect American citizens?

01:47:55.530 --> 01:48:00.230
Mr. Horman, this mission has done everything
humanly possible to locate your son.

01:48:00.838 --> 01:48:03.396
I think you knew
he was dead from the start.

01:48:03.661 --> 01:48:05.346
If we knew, why wouldn't we tell you?

01:48:05.534 --> 01:48:07.608
I don't know that, but
I'm gonna find out.

01:48:07.915 --> 01:48:09.383
Why would we want him dead?

01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:12.070
Probably because he knew
of our involvement in the coup.

01:48:12.250 --> 01:48:14.191
We're not involved, Mr. Horman.

01:48:14.252 --> 01:48:16.409
Our position has been
completely neutral.

01:48:16.662 --> 01:48:18.980
That is a bald-faced lie!

01:48:19.092 --> 01:48:22.038
How can you say a thing like that
when you have army colonels...

01:48:22.099 --> 01:48:24.829
you have naval engineers...
they're all over Vina del Mar?

01:48:24.890 --> 01:48:25.863
Please, sit down.

01:48:25.924 --> 01:48:29.286
Look, look... it's very obvious
you're harbouring some...

01:48:29.347 --> 01:48:30.969
misconception regarding our role here.

01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:33.319
What is your role here...

01:48:33.570 --> 01:48:37.258
besides endorsing a regime
that murders thousands of human beings?

01:48:37.526 --> 01:48:38.917
Let's level with each other, sir.

01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:42.963
If you hadn't been personally involved
in this unfortunate incident...

01:48:43.403 --> 01:48:44.647
you'd be sitting at home

01:48:44.751 --> 01:48:47.700
complacent and more or less
oblivious to all of this.

01:48:52.845 --> 01:48:55.565
This mission is pledged to
protect American interests...

01:48:55.626 --> 01:48:56.508
our interests.

01:48:56.569 --> 01:48:57.833
Well, they're not mine.

01:48:58.949 --> 01:49:02.534
There are over 3,000
U.S. firms doing business down here...

01:49:02.595 --> 01:49:04.864
and those are American interests.

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:07.184
In other words, your interests.

01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:11.897
I'm concerned with the preservation
of a way of life.

01:49:12.437 --> 01:49:13.690
And a damn good one.

01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:17.823
Maybe that's why
there's nobody out there.

01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:24.565
You can't have it both ways.

01:49:29.670 --> 01:49:30.377
Mr....

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.960
I don't know what happened to your kid, Ed...

01:49:37.241 --> 01:49:39.288
but I understand...

01:49:40.175 --> 01:49:42.201
he was a bit of a snoop.

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:45.930
He poked his nose around in
a lot of dangerous places

01:49:45.991 --> 01:49:47.570
where he really didn't belong.

01:49:48.221 --> 01:49:49.755
Now, suppose...

01:49:50.773 --> 01:49:53.304
I went up to your town, New York...

01:49:53.816 --> 01:49:56.112
and I started messing
around with the Mafia...

01:49:56.426 --> 01:49:58.441
and I wind up dead in the East River...

01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:01.951
and my wife, or my father...

01:50:02.746 --> 01:50:05.860
complained to the police
because they didn't protect me.

01:50:07.702 --> 01:50:09.998
They really wouldn't
have much of a case, would they?

01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:13.281
You play with fire,

01:50:14.088 --> 01:50:15.218
you get burned.

01:50:43.333 --> 01:50:44.845
Just a minute. What's going on here?

01:50:44.906 --> 01:50:47.768
They say they wanna ask
more questions about Charlie.

01:50:47.829 --> 01:50:50.586
-Well, who are you?
-I am Inspector Rojas.

01:50:50.647 --> 01:50:53.100
I have instructions to bring Mrs. Horman
to headquarters.

01:50:53.249 --> 01:50:54.944
-For what?
-Interrogation.

01:50:55.833 --> 01:50:57.107
She's not going anywhere.

01:50:59.453 --> 01:51:00.601
-Ed?
-Wait a minute.

01:51:04.387 --> 01:51:06.737
Would you get me the
American consulate, please?

01:51:07.192 --> 01:51:08.233
Is everything all right?

01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:12.518
-Ed, what's wrong?
-Nothing. Nothing, dear.

01:51:13.091 --> 01:51:14.930
I... I'd like to speak to Consul Putnam.

01:51:14.991 --> 01:51:16.989
This is Ed Horman calling. Thank you.

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:19.473
What'd they say at the Ford Foundation?

01:51:22.434 --> 01:51:25.670
-Uh, Consul, there's... What's your name?
-Inspector Rojas.

01:51:25.770 --> 01:51:28.300
An Inspector Rojas here, and he...

01:51:29.133 --> 01:51:31.380
Oh, just a minute.
He wants to speak to you.

01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:35.755
Yes, Consul Putnam?

01:51:37.522 --> 01:51:38.804
Oh, I understand.

01:51:40.022 --> 01:51:40.840
Certainly.

01:51:42.547 --> 01:51:43.665
I will do as you say.

01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:45.167
Fine, sir.

01:51:45.547 --> 01:51:46.414
Thank you.

01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:49.997
Yes?

01:51:50.851 --> 01:51:51.690
Why?

01:51:53.466 --> 01:51:54.740
Yes, all right. But if...

01:51:55.193 --> 01:51:56.565
if I have any trouble with...

01:51:58.073 --> 01:52:00.624
I said, 'All right.'
I'm going with you.

01:52:03.084 --> 01:52:04.351
Name of missing person?

01:52:04.670 --> 01:52:06.193
Don't you have this
written down somewhere?

01:52:06.254 --> 01:52:07.847
I've answered it a thousand times.

01:52:07.908 --> 01:52:10.768
-Name of missing person, please.
-Charles Horman.

01:52:12.879 --> 01:52:14.196
Date of disappearance?

01:52:15.049 --> 01:52:16.282
September 16.

01:52:19.169 --> 01:52:20.646
Time of disappearance?

01:52:20.877 --> 01:52:22.010
I'm not sure.

01:52:22.893 --> 01:52:25.629
He was arrested sometime that afternoon.
I don't know exactly when.

01:52:26.049 --> 01:52:26.908
Time unknown.

01:52:27.418 --> 01:52:29.226
Hay una llamada para el senor Horman.
(There is a call for Mr. Horman).

01:52:30.249 --> 01:52:31.265
You have a call, sir.

01:52:33.829 --> 01:52:35.009
I'll be right back.

01:52:37.238 --> 01:52:38.203
Place of birth?

01:52:38.677 --> 01:52:39.285
New York.

01:52:41.283 --> 01:52:41.850
This room.

01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:42.529
Si.

01:52:50.615 --> 01:52:51.528
Hello?

01:52:52.391 --> 01:52:56.451
I looked into that, uh, Ed,
and it appears that you were right.

01:52:58.296 --> 01:53:01.622
We've been informed that,
uh, the body has been identified...

01:53:01.683 --> 01:53:04.490
through a recheck
of morgue fingerprints.

01:53:06.447 --> 01:53:07.997
Positive identification?

01:53:08.748 --> 01:53:11.330
Yes, absolutely... positive.

01:53:11.683 --> 01:53:12.736
They found him.

01:53:13.650 --> 01:53:15.306
Uh, he was...

01:53:16.094 --> 01:53:17.659
buried in a wall.

01:53:18.730 --> 01:53:19.770
In a wall?

01:53:20.708 --> 01:53:21.850
I don't understand.

01:53:22.794 --> 01:53:26.093
They do that.
Uh, it's quite common down here.

01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:36.004
Wa... Was he killed in the stadium?

01:53:37.009 --> 01:53:39.152
-It looks that way.
-I see.

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:43.012
Good-bye.

01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:15.116
His political affiliation?

01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:21.923
Uh, please, Mrs. Horman.

01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:27.846
We're going home.

01:54:31.275 --> 01:54:32.441
I love you, Ed.

01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:51.060
I want you to contact the military.

01:55:51.253 --> 01:55:53.350
I want you to demand all
the personal effects

01:55:53.411 --> 01:55:54.991
of Charles's that were
stolen from this house.

01:55:56.118 --> 01:55:59.252
-Ed, that's not very realistic.
-And I mean every drawing, every notebook...

01:55:59.313 --> 01:56:01.463
every article my son wrote or had.

01:56:01.859 --> 01:56:03.743
-Ed, I can't go to the...
-Do it!

01:56:04.412 --> 01:56:06.566
Damn it, I don't care whether you
think it's a lead-pipe cinch

01:56:06.627 --> 01:56:08.718
or difficult as hell. -I want it done!

01:56:09.507 --> 01:56:10.415
-I'll try.

01:56:12.670 --> 01:56:13.749
Right here, please.

01:56:16.534 --> 01:56:18.613
-Fine. Good. I think that takes care of it.
-That's it?

01:56:18.674 --> 01:56:19.518
-Yes.
-Okay.

01:56:20.483 --> 01:56:21.811
When will he be sent home?

01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:25.101
Um, I'd say a few days.

01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:28.930
We've got to, uh, get some other clearances.
Nothing important.

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:31.382
We should be able to
ship him home by Friday.

01:56:31.556 --> 01:56:32.463
You're sure?

01:56:33.010 --> 01:56:34.290
You've got my word on it.

01:56:38.389 --> 01:56:40.778
Wait, there's just one more thing.
Uh, just one.

01:56:41.843 --> 01:56:43.334
Did you mention the shipping charges?

01:56:44.435 --> 01:56:48.092
No, I didn't. There's going to be,
uh, some sort of a fee...

01:56:48.265 --> 01:56:50.408
in addition to the airfreight duty.

01:56:50.469 --> 01:56:51.429
How much?

01:56:52.450 --> 01:56:56.723
-Do you have the exact...
-It comes to $931.14.

01:56:57.693 --> 01:56:59.060
That includes the, uh...

01:57:00.022 --> 01:57:02.430
the freight and the taxes
as well, of course.

01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:04.117
You mean you want it now?

01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:09.925
No, I don't think that's necessary.

01:57:10.984 --> 01:57:15.110
-Uh, when the body arrives...
-Don't worry about it. We'll take care of it.

01:57:15.171 --> 01:57:18.444
-Fine, good. Let me get this.
-No, I wanna get rid of the money.

01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:19.841
Okay.

01:57:29.853 --> 01:57:31.433
Beth! Mr. Horman!

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.117
Oh, hello there.

01:57:34.205 --> 01:57:36.250
We called your room this morning.
You'd already checked out.

01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:39.858
I tried to leave you a message.
I'm on my way to La Paz.

01:57:40.052 --> 01:57:43.240
Oh, Bolivia, yes. That's where Babcock
said he was going next, isn't it?

01:57:43.354 --> 01:57:46.711
-Now that you mention it, yes.
-Miss Newman, thank you for your help.

01:57:47.944 --> 01:57:50.432
I'm terribly sorry. Beth.

01:57:51.267 --> 01:57:52.711
You have a good flight, you hear?

01:57:53.004 --> 01:57:54.150
Take care, both of you.

01:57:54.578 --> 01:57:55.171
Beth.

01:57:55.751 --> 01:57:56.325
Beth.

01:57:56.892 --> 01:57:58.435
No more special privileges.

01:58:00.438 --> 01:58:03.745
Listen, Mr. Horman, I wish there was
something we could say or do here.

01:58:03.806 --> 01:58:04.893
Well, there's something I'm gonna do.

01:58:06.476 --> 01:58:07.679
I'm gonna sue you, Phil...

01:58:08.370 --> 01:58:11.748
and Tower and the ambassador
and everybody who let that boy die.

01:58:11.809 --> 01:58:14.840
We're gonna make it so hot for you you'll
wish you were stationed in the Antarctic.

01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:17.433
-Well, I guess that's your privilege.
-No, that's my right!

01:58:18.839 --> 01:58:20.818
I just thank God that
we live in a country

01:58:20.879 --> 01:58:22.941
where we can still put
people like you in jail.

01:58:47.382 --> 01:58:50.838
Ed Horman filed suit
charging 11 government officials...

01:58:50.899 --> 01:58:52.856
including Henry A. Kissinger...

01:58:53.203 --> 01:58:56.003
with complicity and negligence
in the death of his son.

01:59:02.523 --> 01:59:05.703
The body was not returned home
until seven months later...

01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:08.304
making an accurate autopsy impossible.

01:59:15.211 --> 01:59:20.410
After years of litigation, the information
necessary to prove or disprove complicity...

01:59:20.923 --> 01:59:23.579
remained classified as secrets of state.

01:59:25.093 --> 01:59:26.561
The suit was dismissed.
