00:01.896 --> 00:06.275
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER": THE

00:06.310 --> 00:07.862
LATE 90s HEARTTHROB TOOK
POWER.

00:07.896 --> 00:13.689
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK, YOU ARE
THE NEW H.O.H.

00:13.724 --> 00:14.275
WOOO!

00:14.310 --> 00:17.482
YEAH, BABY!

00:17.517 --> 00:18.586
H.O.H.!

00:18.620 --> 00:20.103
Announcer: AND HE WANTED TO
PUT THE SKATER ON ICE.

00:20.137 --> 00:24.034
TO ME, I WANT MIRAI OUT.

00:24.068 --> 00:27.275
THE ONLY PERSON I'M NOT TIGHT
WITH IS MIRAI, AND THE FACT THAT

00:27.310 --> 00:30.827
SHE CAN WIN COMPS, THAT'S
DANGEROUS.

00:30.862 --> 00:34.413
Announcer: MIESHA HOPED HER
TARGET, CARSON, WOULD HIT THE

00:34.448 --> 00:35.551
BLOCK AS WELL.

00:35.586 --> 00:38.758
YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT
PUTTING CARSON AND MIRAI UP.

00:38.793 --> 00:42.689
IN MY MIND, THERE'S JUST ONE
TARGET, AND THAT'S CARSON.

00:42.724 --> 00:45.586
Announcer: BUT KIRKPATRICK
PUT UP A PAWN INSTEAD.

00:45.620 --> 00:50.482
I'VE NOMINATED YOU, CHRIS,
AND YOU, MIRAI.

00:50.517 --> 00:53.034
Announcer: TODRICK AND
MIESHA CONTINUED TO PUSH FOR

00:53.068 --> 00:54.068
CARSON.

00:54.103 --> 00:56.620
CARSON, I GUARANTEE YOU, IS
MY BIGGEST THREAT.

00:56.655 --> 01:00.689
LAST WEEK WAS FOR YOU GUYS
AND YOUR GAME, RIGHT?

01:00.724 --> 01:03.034
THIS WEEK IS FOR ME AND MY GAME.

01:03.068 --> 01:07.827
Announcer: BUT IT MADE
CHRIS AND SHANNA CONSIDER A

01:07.862 --> 01:08.931
DIFFERENT BACKDOOR OPTION.

01:08.965 --> 01:11.724
IF YOU MADE A BIG MOVE AND
PUT TODRICK UP.

01:11.758 --> 01:16.034
I CAME HERE TO PLAY AND MIRAI
IS MY TARGET, BUT IF SHE COMES

01:16.068 --> 01:20.034
DOWN, I'M GOING TO CONSIDER ALL
OF MY OPTIONS FOR A REPLACEMENT.

01:20.068 --> 01:23.448
Announcer: AT THE LIVE VETO
COMPETITION...

01:23.482 --> 01:26.586
Julie: WE HAVE TO GO TO A
THAI BREAKER ROUND.

01:26.620 --> 01:31.000
SO TODRICK AND SHANNA, GRAB YOUR
BOARDS.

01:31.034 --> 01:33.034
Announcer: SHANNA BROUGHT
THE PAIN-A.

01:33.068 --> 01:33.931
Julie: CONGRATULATIONS,
SHANNA.

01:33.965 --> 01:35.413
YOU HAVE WON THE POWER OF VETO.

01:35.448 --> 01:38.931
Announcer: AND SHE KEPT HER
RIDE AND DIES INTACT.

01:38.965 --> 01:41.896
I THINK THE BOTH OF YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY LOVELY, BUT I'M

01:41.931 --> 01:44.586
DECIDING TO KEEP CHRIS'
NOMINATIONS THE SAME.

01:44.620 --> 01:48.034
Announcer: BEFORE THE LIVE
VOTE, KATTAN MADE A HEARTFELT

01:48.068 --> 01:49.655
PLEA TO HELP SAVE HIS FRIEND.

01:49.689 --> 01:52.068
I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY AND I
SHOULD MOVE ON.

01:52.103 --> 01:55.586
I WILL SEE YOU ALL ON THE
OUTSIDE.

01:55.620 --> 01:59.965
Announcer: BUT THE HOUSE
WAS IN SYNC WITH CHRIS ON WHO

02:00.000 --> 02:01.206
NEEDED TO GO.

02:01.241 --> 02:06.689
Julie: BOW A VOTE OF 7-0,
MIRAI, YOU ARE EVICTED FROM THE

02:06.724 --> 02:07.965
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.241
Announcer: TONIGHT, A NEW
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD WILL BE

02:11.275 --> 02:15.448
CROWNED, A PAST CELEBRITY
HOUSEGUEST MAKES A SURPRISE

02:15.482 --> 02:19.965
RETURN, AND TWO MORE CELEBS WILL
FIND THEMSELVES ON THE CHOPPING

02:20.000 --> 02:20.965
BLOCK.

02:21.000 --> 02:30.965
ALL THIS RIGHT NOW ON "CELEBRITY
BIG BROTHER"!

03:08.931 --> 03:11.137
HI!

03:11.172 --> 03:12.034
BYE!

03:12.068 --> 03:15.482
WE LOVE YOU!

03:15.724 --> 03:19.137
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE
7-0.

03:19.172 --> 03:20.310
I DIDN'T, EITHER.

03:20.344 --> 03:22.137
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

03:22.172 --> 03:24.827
I'M LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING
ON.

03:24.862 --> 03:28.689
MIRAI IS LEAVING, AND OBVIOUSLY
I'M SAD TO SEE HER GO, BUT I'M

03:28.724 --> 03:33.655
ALSO REMINDING MYSELF THAT
THERE'S A GAME GOING ON, AND I'M

03:33.689 --> 03:34.310
LIKE, WHAT?

03:34.344 --> 03:36.000
I'M A LITTLE BIT WIGGED OUT.

03:36.034 --> 03:37.517
SHE WANTED TO STAY SO BAD.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.413
SHE WAS TOO STRONG.

03:39.448 --> 03:42.310
SEEING MIRAI OUT THE DOOR, I
WISH HER WELL.

03:42.344 --> 03:45.241
I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT'S NOT TOO
FAR FROM HER AGE.

03:45.275 --> 03:47.448
MY DAUGHTER IS 23, BUT THIS IS A
GAME.

03:47.482 --> 03:51.482
IT'S TOO BAD, BUT I'M STILL HERE

03:51.517 --> 03:53.275
NOW WE CHANGE AND DO AN
H.O.H.

03:53.310 --> 03:54.517
OH, MY GOD.

03:54.551 --> 03:57.862
MIRAI'S PREEVICTION SPEECH
WAS VERY HEARTFELT, BUT THERE

03:57.896 --> 04:00.862
WAS ONE MOMENT WHERE SHE DID
THROW A LITTLE SHADE.

04:00.896 --> 04:04.344
I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS
EXPERIENCE TO BE HERE.

04:04.379 --> 04:08.413
AND IT HAS BEEN SO DIFFICULT FOR
ME HERE BECAUSE YOU ARE ALL SO

04:08.448 --> 04:12.379
MUCH OLDER, BUT-- I KNOW I'M
EMOTIONAL.

04:12.413 --> 04:16.586
I'M PRETTY SURE MY NOSE IS
YOUNGER THAN MIRAI.

04:16.620 --> 04:17.689
JUST SAYING.

04:17.724 --> 04:18.793
YOU DID GREAT.

04:18.827 --> 04:23.965
I NEED A DRINK.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.620
YOU GUYS, FOR ALL THE YEARS
I'VE WATCHED THIS SHOW, IT WAS,

04:27.655 --> 04:32.517
LIKE, MY DREAM TO WIN A VETO,
AND THEY JUST DID WAS SO COOL.

04:32.551 --> 04:34.000
I'M SO HAPPY YOU WON THAT.

04:34.034 --> 04:37.137
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW, LITTLE
GIRL DREAM COME TRUE.

04:37.172 --> 04:40.758
I DON'T EVEN CARE IF IT WAS FOR
FIVE MINUTES, IT WAS AN AMAZING

04:40.793 --> 04:41.344
FEELING.

04:41.379 --> 04:42.137
YOU KILLED IT.

04:42.172 --> 04:43.241
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

04:43.275 --> 04:45.034
I GUESSED ON TWO OF THEM
BECAUSE I COULDN'T SEE.

04:45.068 --> 04:47.034
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

04:47.068 --> 04:49.172
WERE YOU TRYING TO LOSE?

04:49.206 --> 04:52.379
OR DO YOU NEED TO SEE AN
OPHTHALMOLOGIST?

04:52.413 --> 04:57.896
I NEED TO SEE AN
OPHTHALMOLOGIST.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.275
COME IN MERE, MISTER.

04:59.310 --> 05:01.931
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I DID
WRONG.

05:01.965 --> 05:04.931
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

05:04.965 --> 05:08.448
IF SHE REALLY WANTS IT SO
BADLY, THEN SHE SHOULD STAY.

05:08.482 --> 05:11.310
YEAH, BUT EVERYBODY HERE
WANTS IT BADLY.

05:11.344 --> 05:14.482
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T.

05:14.517 --> 05:19.034
YOU HAD THE BIGGEST AND
KINDEST HEART, CHRIS, AND

05:19.068 --> 05:21.965
EVERYONE LOVES, LOVES, LOVES YOU
FOR IT.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.965
I DON'T THINK KATTAN FULLY
UNDERSTANDS THE GAME.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.034
I KNOW HIS HEART IS BREAKING,
BUT HE SEES THIS SORT OF

05:30.068 --> 05:31.034
INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL.

05:31.068 --> 05:32.068
BUT MIRAI WAS NO JOKE.

05:32.103 --> 05:34.379
SHE WAS A FIERCE COMPETITOR.

05:34.413 --> 05:36.965
AND SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN US ALL
OUT DOWN THE ROAD.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.068
I DIDN'T CATCH ON TO THAT I
WAS FEELING THROUGHOUT THE WEEK

05:42.103 --> 05:45.482
THAT MIRAI REALLY DESERVED TO
STAY, MORE THAN I DID, IN A WAY,

05:45.517 --> 05:48.137
JUST BECAUSE SHE REALLY WANTED
TO STAY SO MUCH.

05:48.172 --> 05:53.034
I DIDN'T GET THE SAME NOTE AS
EVERYONE ELSE DID ABOUT THE

05:53.068 --> 05:53.758
VOTING.

05:53.793 --> 05:54.689
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

05:54.724 --> 05:55.551
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

05:55.586 --> 05:57.620
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG,
CHRIS.

05:57.655 --> 05:59.034
YOU SHOULD FEEL REALLY GOOD.

05:59.068 --> 06:08.068
YOU DID A REALLY HONORABLE
THING.

06:08.103 --> 06:09.758
ARE YOU OKAY?

06:09.793 --> 06:10.827
DID WE MIS?

06:10.862 --> 06:12.551
NO.

06:12.586 --> 06:14.413
WE DIDN'T MISS AN
OPPORTUNITY?

06:14.448 --> 06:15.620
NO.

06:15.655 --> 06:18.689
SHANNA AND I ARE DISCUSSING
IF WE MISSED OUR MOMENT WITH

06:18.724 --> 06:22.206
TODRICK, AND OF COURSE WE DID,
BUT IT KIND OF HINGED ON WHETHER

06:22.241 --> 06:25.034
CHRIS UNDERSTOOD THE GAME ENOUGH
TO VOTE WITH US.

06:25.068 --> 06:29.068
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, IT KIND OF
SCARED US INTO SAYING NO.

06:29.103 --> 06:32.344
NOW SHANNA AND I HAVE TO WORK TO
GET HIM OUT.

06:32.379 --> 06:41.241
AND THIS MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS.

06:41.275 --> 06:48.137
DANGEROUS.

06:51.827 --> 06:54.137
WHERE IS EVERYONE AT?

06:54.172 --> 06:55.344
?

06:55.379 --> 06:58.241
THE BACK ROOM DISCUSSING OUR
DEMISE, HOW TO GET RID OF US.

06:58.275 --> 07:02.034
IN "BIG BROTHER" YOU HAVE TO
SURROUND YOURSELF WITH GOOD

07:02.068 --> 07:02.965
ALLIES.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.758
I WORK WITH TODRICK, MIESHA, AND
LAMAR.

07:05.793 --> 07:09.379
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I'M
PROTECTED AND ALIGNED WITH THE

07:09.413 --> 07:10.862
TRONGEST PEOPLE SO I CAN STAY
AROUND.

07:10.896 --> 07:12.172
WHAT DO WE DO NEXT?

07:12.206 --> 07:13.172
ANOTHER H.O.H. COMPETITION?

07:13.206 --> 07:14.241
I KNOW THAT.

07:14.275 --> 07:16.241
WHAT DO WE DO NEXT?

07:16.275 --> 07:18.241
IF WE WIN IT, WHO DO WE PUT UP.

07:18.275 --> 07:20.310
THE BIGGEST THREAT IN THE
HOUSE IS CARSON.

07:20.344 --> 07:22.413
I THINK WE HAVE TO PUT UP
CARSON.

07:22.448 --> 07:23.896
HE'S ON THE OTHER SIDE.

07:23.931 --> 07:27.413
GOING INTO THIS H.O.H., I'M
LOOKING AT THIS AS A

07:27.448 --> 07:30.862
MAKE-OR-BREAK MOVE OF THE WEEK
BECAUSE IF WE'RE ABLE TO

07:30.896 --> 07:33.448
MAINTAIN POWER, I THINK WE BREAK
THE OTHER SIDE.

07:33.482 --> 07:36.172
BUT IF THEY CAN GET POWER, I
HAVE A FEELING I'M GOING TO BE

07:36.206 --> 07:37.172
ON THE BLOCK.

07:37.206 --> 07:45.862
SO ME OR ONE OF MY ALLIES HAS TO
WIN THIS WEEK.

07:45.896 --> 07:50.137
I DON'T THINK MIESHA WAS
HAPPY SHE DIDN'T GET TO COMPETE

07:50.172 --> 07:51.379
IN THE VETO THING.

07:51.413 --> 07:53.965
NO, SHE WAS ON THE EDGE OF
HER SEAT.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.758
AND WHEN SHANNA WON, SHE WAS
ALSO NOT HAPPY

07:56.793 --> 07:59.517
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

07:59.551 --> 08:02.620
SHE WAS VERY INTENSE.

08:02.655 --> 08:06.034
IF SHE WINS, I'M OUT OF HERE.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.655
OR ME.

08:07.689 --> 08:09.413
IT'S BEEN NICE KNOWING YOU.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.827
I'LL LEAVE YOU SOME CAKE
RECIPES.

08:11.862 --> 08:14.448
I'M LITERALLY FINE WITH
ANYONE WINNING IT EXCEPT HER.

08:14.482 --> 08:15.793
YEAH, ME, TOO.

08:15.827 --> 08:21.275
HAPPY FOR ANYONE TO WIN, BUT
SHE'S BEEN A BIT OF A DICTATOR

08:21.310 --> 08:22.517
MIESHA IS RUNNING THIS HOUSE.

08:22.551 --> 08:29.896
IT'SCLIKE A CULT, WHERE YOU HAVE
TO EAT EGG WHITES AND WEAR

08:29.931 --> 08:31.137
LEGGINGS.

08:31.172 --> 08:33.896
I'M WORRIED SHE'S GOING TO START
PICKING OFF PEOPLE FROM OUR

08:33.931 --> 08:35.482
LITTLE OF GROUP.

08:35.517 --> 08:40.034
ONE OF THE TRES AMIGAS NEEDS TO
WIN H.O.H. THIS WEEK VERY BADLY.

08:40.068 --> 08:42.620
I CAN'T HANDLE ANOTHER H.O.H.

08:42.655 --> 08:42.965
WITH HER.

08:43.000 --> 08:43.448
I KNOW.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.034
I CAN'T DO IT.

08:45.068 --> 08:51.172
YOU'VE BEEN SO LUCKY TONIGHT,
LET'S HOPE YOUR LUCK CONTINUES.

08:51.206 --> 08:54.586
I NEED EVERYONE IN THE LIVING
ROOM!

08:54.620 --> 08:57.034
IT'S TIME FOR THE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION!

08:57.068 --> 08:58.379
ARE YOU READY TO PLAY?

08:58.413 --> 09:00.793
IF I GET TO WEAR THAT OUTFIT.

09:00.827 --> 09:01.517
LET'S GO!

09:01.551 --> 09:08.517
COME ON!

09:08.551 --> 09:10.862
WHAT UP, CELEBRITIES.

09:10.896 --> 09:11.965
IT'S ME KATO KAYLYNN.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.413
OH, MY GOD, CATO KALIN IS IN
THE HOT TUB.

09:18.448 --> 09:21.827
I THOUGHT HE WAS REALLY GREAT
ON "BIG BROTHER."

09:21.862 --> 09:23.620
AND HE WAS GREAT IN THE O.J.

09:23.655 --> 09:24.827
TRIAL.

09:24.862 --> 09:27.379
AS YOU CAN GUESS, NOBODY
KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE STRESS OF

09:27.413 --> 09:30.655
BEING IN THE "BIG BROTHER"
HOUSE, THAN YOURS TRULY.

09:30.689 --> 09:34.413
I FOUND THE WAY TO MELT YOUR
STRESS AWAY-- HOT DOG PARTY AT

09:34.448 --> 09:35.517
MY PLACE.

09:35.551 --> 09:37.034
YOU'RE INVITED TO THE PAD AT THE
TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.

09:37.068 --> 09:41.241
YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE THE SKI LIFT
TO GET HERE, AND IF YOU DON'T

09:41.275 --> 09:46.034
SEE ME WHEN YOU GET HERE, I'M
PROBABLY IN THE LODGE GETTING MY

09:46.068 --> 09:47.275
DRINK ON.

09:47.310 --> 09:54.965
HEAD TO THE SKI LIFT WHERE WE'LL
GET ALL THE DEETS IS.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.931
I SAID HOT TUB!

09:56.965 --> 09:57.793
NO SPLASHING!

09:57.827 --> 10:01.000
I'M SLIPPING.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.448
I'M SLIDING!

10:03.482 --> 10:04.275
<i>[ APPLAUSE ].</i>

10:04.310 --> 10:06.586
THERE'S A HOT TUB IN OUR
FUTURE.

10:06.620 --> 10:07.517
ARE.

10:07.551 --> 10:09.000
KATO IS LOOKING KIND OF GOOD
IN THERE.

10:09.034 --> 10:11.965
I WOULD LOVE TO WIN THIS
H.O.H. COMPETITION BECAUSE I

10:12.000 --> 10:15.172
KEEP GETTING SO CLOSE TO WINNING
THINGS IN THIS HOUSE, AND I

10:15.206 --> 10:16.896
HAVEN'T WON ANYTHING YET.

10:16.931 --> 10:19.517
SO I WANT TO KEEP MY AND ME
ALLIANCE SAFE.

10:19.551 --> 10:20.965
I WANT TO BE UP IN THAT H.O.H.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.241
ROOM, HONEY.

10:22.275 --> 10:24.275
I KNOW IT MIGHT NOT BE IDEAL
FOR ME TO WIN A SECOND H.O.H.,

10:24.310 --> 10:28.310
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF MY TARGET
CAN GET ANY BIGGER THAN IT IS,

10:28.344 --> 10:31.793
SO IF IT'S GOING TO BE BIG, I
THINK GO BIG OR GO HOME, AND I'M

10:31.827 --> 10:33.034
NOT GOING HOME.

10:33.068 --> 10:37.931
I REALLY NEED TO WIN THIS
H.O.H. TO GET SOME POWER BACK IN

10:37.965 --> 10:38.586
OUR LITTLE GROUP.

10:38.620 --> 10:41.103
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR?

10:41.137 --> 10:46.137
THINGS ARE STARTING TO HEAT UP
HERE IN THE CHALET.

10:53.068 --> 10:56.379
LET'S GO!

10:56.413 --> 11:00.689
HERE IT IS!

11:00.724 --> 11:01.103
WOOO-WOOO!

11:01.137 --> 11:02.413
IT'S GOING.

11:02.448 --> 11:05.551
I WALK OUT INTO THE BACKYARD,
AND IT'S ALL SNOWY, AND THERE'S

11:05.586 --> 11:08.448
A HOT TUB AND A SKI LIFT.

11:08.482 --> 11:10.034
I LOVE A GOOD LIFT.

11:10.068 --> 11:13.620
I COULD USE ONE RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

11:13.655 --> 11:17.655
HURRY TO THE TOP OF THE
MOUNTAIN AND JOIN CATO'S HOT TUB

11:17.689 --> 11:22.482
PARTY, BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR SKI
CLOTHES IN THE HOT TUB SO YOU'RE

11:22.517 --> 11:24.344
GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.275
YEAH!

11:26.620 --> 11:30.344
THIS COMPETITION TAKES PLACE
ON THE SKI LIFT WHERE YOUR GOAL

11:30.379 --> 11:34.344
IS TO QUICKLY STRIP DOWN TO YOUR
SWIMSUIT AND TAKE A DIP IN THE

11:34.379 --> 11:35.034
HOT TUB.

11:35.068 --> 11:35.965
THINK IT'S EASY?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.137
IT'S NOT.

11:37.172 --> 11:39.241
YOU HAVE TO KEEP THREE BUTTONS
PRESSED WHILE UNDRESSING.

11:39.275 --> 11:40.551
WHAT!

11:40.586 --> 11:44.827
IF YOU KEEP ALL THREE BUTTONS
PRESSED, YOUR GAME CLOCK RUNS AT

11:44.862 --> 11:46.068
NORMAL SPEED.

11:46.103 --> 11:50.517
BUT LET GO OF ONE BUTTON AND
YOUR CLOCK RUNS 10 TIMES FASTER.

11:50.551 --> 11:53.551
LET GO OF TWO BUTTONS, YOUR
CLOCK RUNS 30 TIMES FASTER.

11:53.586 --> 11:55.344
OH, DEAR!

11:55.379 --> 11:59.413
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
BUTTONS PRESSED, YOUR LOCK RUNS

11:59.448 --> 12:01.034
60 TIMES FASTER THAN NORMAL.

12:01.068 --> 12:04.137
THAT MEANS EVERY SECOND OF REAL
TIME WILL COUNT AS A WHOLE

12:04.172 --> 12:05.448
MINUTE ON YOUR GAME CLOCK.

12:05.482 --> 12:08.896
WHILE TRYING TO CHANGE, YOU CAN
PRESS AND LET GO OF BUTTONS AS

12:08.931 --> 12:12.482
YOU SEE FIT, AND YOUR GAME CLOCK
WILL ADJUST ACCORDINGLY.

12:12.517 --> 12:16.448
ONCE DOWN TO YOUR BATHING SUIT,
JUMP IN THE HOT TUB AND HIT THE

12:16.482 --> 12:19.172
BUTTON ON THE BUOY TO LOCK IN
YOUR TIME.

12:19.206 --> 12:22.586
THE PERSON WHO STRIPS DOWN TO
THEIR SWIM SEE THE AND HITS THE

12:22.620 --> 12:24.931
BUTTON WITH THE LOWEST TIME ON
THE GAME CLOCK WILL BE THE NEXT

12:24.965 --> 12:25.620
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

12:25.655 --> 12:28.655
IT'S TIME TO PLAY "SKI STRIP."

12:28.689 --> 12:29.724
YEAH!

12:29.758 --> 12:35.034
TODRICK, HEAD OVER TO THE SKI

12:35.068 --> 12:35.379
LIFT.

12:35.413 --> 12:36.586
YOU'RE UP.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.448
EVERYONE ELSE, HEAD INSIDE AND
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN IT'S YOUR

12:38.482 --> 12:38.862
TURN.

12:38.896 --> 12:39.931
I AM READY!

12:39.965 --> 12:41.896
LET'S DO THIS!

12:41.931 --> 12:44.448
BASED ON WHERE I FEEL LIKE MY
RELATIONSHIPS LIE IN THE HOUSE,

12:44.482 --> 12:47.172
AS LONG AS CARSON OR CYNTHIA
DON'T WIN, I'M OKAY.

12:47.206 --> 12:50.034
BUT IT'S BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN
SORRY, OKAY.

12:50.068 --> 12:55.620
WE'VE GOT TO STEP IT UP, AND
WE'VE GOT TO COME AND SLAY THIS

12:55.655 --> 12:59.172
COMPETITION OR WE COULD BE IN
TROUBLE

12:59.206 --> 13:03.517
IN THIS COMPETITION, WE HAVE

13:03.551 --> 13:09.620
TO STRIP OFF ALL THIS BULKY
WINTER GEAR AND GET DOWN TO

13:09.655 --> 13:10.896
OURUNDIES AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

13:10.931 --> 13:14.413
HERE'S THE CATCH-- WE HAVE TO
KEEP THREE BUTTONS PRESSED DOWN

13:14.448 --> 13:15.379
AT ALL TIMES.

13:15.413 --> 13:18.655
IF WEGO OF A BUTTON, OUR TIME
RUNS FASTER

13:18.689 --> 13:21.965
THE MORE BUTTONS THAT AREN'T

13:22.000 --> 13:24.655
PRESSED DOWN, FASTER THE TIME
GOES.

13:24.689 --> 13:28.206
WHOEVER GETS IN THE HOT TUB WITH
THE FASTEST TIME IS THE NEW HEAD

13:28.241 --> 13:30.827
OF HOUSEHOLD.

13:32.103 --> 13:37.034
I HAVE NEVER WISHED I WAS AN
OCTOPUS SO BAD IN MY ENTIRE

13:37.068 --> 13:38.068
LIFE.

13:38.103 --> 13:41.793
YOU CANNOT HAVE ENOUGH LIMBS TO
PLAY THIS GAME.

13:41.827 --> 13:44.206
YOU ARE STRETCHING AND
CONTORTING YOUR BODY WHILE

13:44.241 --> 13:48.482
TRYING TO KEEP YOUR TOE AND A
FOOT AND AN ARM AND A LEG AND A

13:48.517 --> 13:52.000
BUTT ON A BUTTON AND TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT HOW THE HELL YOU'RE

13:52.034 --> 13:55.896
SUPPOSED TO GET YOUR CLOTHES
OFF.

13:55.931 --> 14:03.896
THE GORD LORD HAS BLESSED ME
WITH A BADONKA-DONK OUT OF THIS

14:03.931 --> 14:05.137
WORLD.

14:05.172 --> 14:08.206
MY STRATEGY IS TO PRESS THIS
BUTTON AND RELEASE THE HANDS AND

14:08.241 --> 14:10.586
KEEP THE HAND ON THE BUTTON AT
ALL TIMES.

14:10.620 --> 14:13.827
THANK YOU, BOOTY

14:13.862 --> 14:14.793
I FINISHED.

14:14.827 --> 14:20.137
DO A QUICK THANK YOU TO THE MY
BODONKA-DONK.

14:20.172 --> 14:22.586
I HAVE BEEN DOING QUICK CHANGES
ON BROADWAY MY LIFE AND I FEEL

14:22.620 --> 14:24.689
I'M PREPARED FOR THIS
COMPETITION, AND I'M FEELING

14:24.724 --> 14:27.172
PRETTY GOOD

14:27.206 --> 14:31.655
I HAVEN'T SCED IN A VERY LONG
TIME.

14:31.689 --> 14:33.931
ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT SKIING.

14:33.965 --> 14:41.034
MY PLAN IS TO DO MY BEST AS A,
YOU KNOW, A GUY PRETENDING TO

14:41.068 --> 14:42.344
SKI AGAIN.

14:42.379 --> 14:46.344
AND I HAVEN'T SKIED SINCE I WAS
12.

14:46.379 --> 14:49.344
ON "S.N.L." WE WOULD DO QUICK
CHANGES, BUT YOU HAD THE HELP

14:49.379 --> 14:53.862
BACK THEN, AND HERE, I,
OBVIOUSLY, HAVE NO HELP PUT BUT

14:53.896 --> 14:56.310
I HAVE NEVER DONE A QUICK CHANGE
ON A SKI LIFT.

14:56.344 --> 15:00.172
WELL, I'M A LITTLE THROWN OFF BY
THE FACT THAT I WAS TOLD TO

15:00.206 --> 15:00.724
STRIP.

15:00.758 --> 15:03.413
SO I JUST WENT FOR IT.

15:03.448 --> 15:06.965
AND, AS YOU CAN SEE, I KEPT MY
LONG JOHNS ON.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.793
IT'S A NEW LOOK.

15:14.068 --> 15:18.241
MY GOAL IS TO MOVE AS FAST AS
HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

15:18.275 --> 15:21.241
WHO NEEDS TO HOLD DOWN THESE
BUTTONS TO GET A SLOWER TIME?

15:21.275 --> 15:25.724
I JUST WANT MY CLOTHES OFF.

15:25.758 --> 15:32.310
WHEN YOU MOVE AS FAST AS I DO,
TIME SLOWS DOWN AROUND YOU.

15:32.344 --> 15:38.482
LEAVE IT TO TODD PRINLS TO
THINK HE HAS OUTSMARTED THE

15:38.517 --> 15:39.655
SYSTEM.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.655
I THINK YOU MISSED THE ENTIRE
MEMO OF THIS COMPETITION.

15:41.689 --> 15:46.551
YOU DIDN'T PUSH DOWN ANY BUTTONS

15:46.586 --> 15:51.655
I NEED TO WIN H.O.H., OR

15:51.689 --> 15:54.275
CARSON OR SHANNA NEEDS TO WIN.

15:54.310 --> 15:55.000
WHY?

15:55.034 --> 15:56.034
BECAUSE WE DON'T RUN THIS HOUSE.

15:56.068 --> 15:57.724
WE LIVE IN MIESHA'S HOUSE.

15:57.758 --> 15:59.551
AND WE NEED TO TAKE THE HOUSE
BACK.

15:59.586 --> 16:06.655
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF WE EVER HAD
THE HOUSE.

16:06.689 --> 16:12.206
MADAM BAILEY IS TAKING HER SWEET
TIME, AND SHE SAID, "WHAT

16:12.241 --> 16:14.241
BUTTONS?"
SHE IS NOT EVEN TRYING TO PRESS

16:14.275 --> 16:15.206
ANY OF THE BUTTONS.

16:15.241 --> 16:19.310
SHE'S JUST DOING A SLOW LITTLE
STRIP SEARCH.

16:19.344 --> 16:21.206
AND I'M NOT MAD AT.

16:21.241 --> 16:24.551
I'M NOT THE REFEREE, BUT I DON'T
SEE CYNTHIA WINNING THIS

16:24.586 --> 16:25.000
SPECIFIC COMP TGZ.

16:25.034 --> 16:26.241
HELP!

16:26.275 --> 16:28.758
I'M HOLDING ON TO THREE
DIFFERENT BUTTONS.

16:28.793 --> 16:33.551
HOW THE HELL DO I TAKE MY
CLOTHES OFF?

16:33.586 --> 16:37.689
I'M NOT TOO SURE HOW WELL I DID.

16:37.724 --> 16:42.206
BUT I'M STILL FEELING KIND OF
OPTIMISTIC.

16:42.241 --> 16:49.689
GOING INTO THIS H.O.H., I

16:49.724 --> 16:54.482
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS
NOT A POWER SHIFT.

16:54.517 --> 17:01.172
SO ME OR RUN OF MY ALLIES HAS TO
WIN THIS WEEK.

17:01.206 --> 17:05.034
THE HARDEST PART ABOUT THIS
H.O.H. CHALLENGE FOR ME IS ONLY

17:05.068 --> 17:09.034
HAVING ONE HAND AND MY TEETH TO
HELP ME GET UNDRESSED.

17:09.068 --> 17:14.758
IT'S, LIKE, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

17:14.793 --> 17:21.068
MY STRATEGY IN THIS COMPETITION
IS TO MAINTAIN THREE POINTS OF

17:21.103 --> 17:22.379
CONTACT.

17:22.413 --> 17:25.620
GOOD THING I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A
BUNCH OF EXPERIENCE BECAUSE MOMS

17:25.655 --> 17:28.586
WHO HAVE BEEN BUSY FEEDING
BABIES IN THEIR ARMS KNOW

17:28.620 --> 17:29.896
EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

17:29.931 --> 17:33.896
WE FIND ALL KINDS OF WAYS TO GET
WHAT WE NEED DONE, EVEN WHEN OUR

17:33.931 --> 17:38.068
LIMBS ARE BUSY.

17:46.586 --> 17:47.413
WOOO!

17:47.448 --> 17:48.655
THERE YOU GO!

17:48.689 --> 17:52.655
I THOUGHT I DID PRETTY WELL,
BUT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO

17:52.689 --> 17:57.586
TELL HOW WELL I MAINTAINED THE
THREE POINTS OF CONTACT.

17:57.620 --> 18:02.206
SO MY TIME MIGHT BE A LOT MORE
THAN I THOUGHT.

18:02.241 --> 18:06.758
LAWYER

18:08.931 --> 18:11.965
GOING INTO THIS H.O.H., I'M
IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE TWO

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
DIFFERENT GROUPS.

18:13.034 --> 18:15.413
I'M REALLY CLOSE WITH CARSON AND
CYNTHIA.

18:15.448 --> 18:21.689
THEN I'M IN THIS GROUP WITH
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK, TODRICK AND

18:21.724 --> 18:22.896
MIESHA.

18:22.931 --> 18:30.000
SO I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD, NO
MATTER WHO WINS THIS H.O.H.

18:30.034 --> 18:33.931
MY STRATEGY IS TO TAKE MY
HANDS OFF THE TWO BUTTONS AND

18:33.965 --> 18:37.275
GET THE SKIS OFF AS QUICK AS
POSSIBLE, PUT MY BACK AGAINST

18:37.310 --> 18:40.517
ANOTHER BUTTON, USE MY TWO FEET
SO I HAVE THE FREEDOM OF MY

18:40.551 --> 18:54.241
HANDS.

18:54.275 --> 18:57.413
I PRESS THE BUTTON, I'M

18:57.448 --> 19:00.620
FEELING PRETTY GOOD, BUT WITH
ALL THESE CELEBRITIES AND

19:00.655 --> 19:01.827
ATHLETES, YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.

19:01.862 --> 19:04.896
I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE BUTT
STRATEGY LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

19:04.931 --> 19:07.034
THE OLD RELIABLE BUTT STRATEGY.

19:07.068 --> 19:08.413
I MISSED OUT ON THAT ONE.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.689
GOOD JOB, BABE.

19:09.724 --> 19:12.793
THANK YOU, IT WAS HARD.

19:12.827 --> 19:15.551
RIGHT

19:15.586 --> 19:20.137
I'M READY TO BLA, READY TO
GET THIS H.O.H.

19:20.172 --> 19:32.413
I HATE LOSING.

19:32.448 --> 19:33.965
LAMAR IS 6'10".

19:34.000 --> 19:38.310
HE IS SO HUGE, AND WATCHING HIM
IN THESE SKIS MANEUVER ON THIS

19:38.344 --> 19:40.551
SKI LIFT IS JUST HYSTERICAL.

19:40.586 --> 19:44.172
I SUCK AT IT.

19:44.206 --> 19:48.448
I COULD NEVER GET, LIKE, SIDE TO
SIDE-- WHAT DO THEY CALL THAT,

19:48.482 --> 19:49.827
SLALOM OR WHATEVER.

19:49.862 --> 19:51.275
I COULD JUST NEVER DO IT.

19:51.310 --> 19:55.034
I JUST WENT STRAIGHT DOWN ON THE
BUNNY SLOPE.

19:55.068 --> 20:00.000
IT IS VERY APPARENT TO ME
THAT LAMAR HAS NEVER BEEN TO A

20:00.034 --> 20:03.551
SKI SLOPE BEFORE.

20:03.586 --> 20:08.344
HE IS CRUNCHED INTO THIS LITTLE
SKI LIFT, TRYING SO HARD.

20:08.379 --> 20:12.517
OH, LAMAR ODOM, THE GIFT THAT
JUST KEEPS ON GIVING.

20:12.551 --> 20:17.310
COME ON, MAN!

20:17.344 --> 20:20.034
I WISH MY BUT WAS BIGGER.

20:20.068 --> 20:22.172
I GOT TO GET ALL WAIT IN THE HOT
TUB?

20:22.206 --> 20:27.344
YOU HAVE TO GO AND HIT THAT
BUTTON IN THERE.

20:27.379 --> 20:29.931
[ APPLAUSE ].

20:29.965 --> 20:31.172
YOU DID GOOD.

20:31.206 --> 20:34.620
I'M NOT REALLY FEELING TOO
GOOD ABOUT MY TIME, BUT I HOPE

20:34.655 --> 20:36.620
IT WAS ENOUGH TO WIN THIS H.O.H.

20:38.034 --> 20:42.000
I'M JUST KIND OF TRYING TO
REMAIN CALM.

20:42.034 --> 20:43.344
AND LOOK CUTE.

20:43.379 --> 20:47.241
BECAUSE LOOKING CUTE IS HALF THE
BATTLE.

20:47.275 --> 20:52.758
THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE MY
SAFETY IS TO WIN THIS H.O.H.

20:52.793 --> 20:59.551
I AM NEVER GOING TO TRY HARDER
TO WIN AT ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.

20:59.586 --> 21:03.137
IF SOMEONE, LIKE, OH, SAY,
TODRICK OR MIESHA, WERE TO WIN

21:03.172 --> 21:06.172
AGAIN, WE COULD BE IN BIG
TROUBLE.

21:11.310 --> 21:16.931
I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD ABOUT

21:16.965 --> 21:18.172
THIS COMPETITION.

21:18.206 --> 21:21.896
BASICALLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS
STRIP DOWN TO YOUR UNDERWEAR

21:21.931 --> 21:24.896
WHILE KEEPING ONE BUTTON PUSHED
OVER HERE AND ONE OVER THERE AND

21:24.931 --> 21:27.172
THEN ONE DOWN THERE.

21:27.206 --> 21:31.551
THE FEWER BUTTONS PRESSED, THE
MORE YOUR TIME ACCUMULATES.

21:31.586 --> 21:35.241
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS,
BUT THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF

21:35.275 --> 21:39.068
THIS WHOLE COMPETITION WAS
REMOVING MY PANTS.

21:39.103 --> 21:43.068
YOU'RE WEARING OVERALLS, AND
YOU'VE GOT, LIKE, 14 LAYERS ON.

21:43.103 --> 21:53.862
IT'S LIKE CHANGING IN A CAR, OR
AN AIRPLANE, OR A GONDOLA.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.517
I THINK I'M DOING REALLY WELL.

21:55.551 --> 22:00.137
I'M JUST HAVING A HARD TIME
GETTING THESE PESKY OVERALLS OFF

22:00.172 --> 22:02.413
MY FEET.

22:02.448 --> 22:05.482
IT'S THE WORST WHEN YOU GET

22:05.517 --> 22:12.586
LITERALLY CAUGHT WITH YOUR PANTS
DOWN, IN PUBLIC, ON A SKI LIFT.

22:18.827 --> 22:23.620
I SWAN DIVE, VISUALIZING AN

22:23.655 --> 22:27.862
ESTHER WILLIAMS EXTRAVAGANZA,
AND I'M PRETTY PROUD OF MYSELF.

22:27.896 --> 22:32.724
I HOPE IT'S WORTH POSSIBLY
RUINING MY HIGHLIGHTS SO I CAN

22:32.758 --> 22:33.793
WIN THIS H.O.H.

22:33.827 --> 22:37.275
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY DEEP
CONDITION TONIGHT.

22:37.310 --> 22:39.931
OOOH!

22:39.965 --> 22:41.137
KEY STRIP.

22:41.172 --> 22:44.551
SO CHRIS KATTAN WENT INSIDE
BECAUSE HE WASN'T FEELING VERY

22:44.586 --> 22:45.241
WELL.

22:45.275 --> 22:47.896
NOW LET'S FIND OUT HOE WE DID.

22:47.931 --> 22:50.689
TODRICK AND MIESHA ARE A
POWER DUO.

22:50.724 --> 22:52.931
THEY HAVE HAD CONTROL FROM THE
GET-GO, AND WE REALLY NEED

22:52.965 --> 22:55.793
SOMEONE TO WIN THIS COMPETITION
SO THE HOUSE CAN BREAK THAT UP A

22:55.827 --> 22:56.931
BIT.

22:56.965 --> 23:02.137
TODRICK WAS UP FIRST AND
FINISHED WITH A TIME OF...

23:02.172 --> 23:04.034
SIX MINUTES AND 54 SECONDS.

23:04.068 --> 23:06.827
TODRICK!

23:06.862 --> 23:07.793
WAY TO GO, BUDDY.

23:07.827 --> 23:09.206
HE WON.

23:09.241 --> 23:11.379
WE GET IT, LET'S GO INSIDE.

23:11.413 --> 23:16.034
CHRIS KATTAN FINISHED WITH A
SCORE OF... CHRIS KATTAN MAXED

23:16.068 --> 23:16.551
OUT.

23:16.586 --> 23:17.586
GOOD JOB, CHRIS.

23:17.620 --> 23:21.310
TODD FINISHED WITH A SCORE

23:21.344 --> 23:23.206
OF...

23:23.241 --> 23:24.827
48 MINUTES AND 36 SECONDS.

23:24.862 --> 23:27.413
OH, WELL.

23:27.448 --> 23:30.620
THE LONG, SEXY STRIP.

23:30.655 --> 23:34.793
CYNTHIA FINISHED WITH A TIME
OF...

23:34.827 --> 23:36.551
OH, MY GOD!

23:36.586 --> 23:40.034
70 MINUTES AND 46 SECONDS.

23:40.068 --> 23:46.827
MIESHA FINISHED WITH A SCORE
OF...

23:46.862 --> 23:51.000
FIVE MINUTES AND 50 SECONDS.

23:51.034 --> 23:52.827
GOOD JOB, MIESHA!

23:52.862 --> 23:54.793
OH, MY GOD!

23:54.827 --> 23:56.103
OH, MY GOD.

23:56.137 --> 23:58.586
AMAZING JOB!

23:58.620 --> 24:16.724
SHANNA FINISHED WITH A SCORE
OF...

24:16.758 --> 24:23.482
23 MINUTES AND 48 SECONDS.

24:23.517 --> 24:23.862
BEAT ME.

24:23.896 --> 24:24.689
RESPECTABLE.

24:24.724 --> 24:25.310
LAMAR FINISHED WITH A SCORE
OF...

24:25.344 --> 24:26.344
22 MINUTES AND 46 SECONDS.

24:26.379 --> 24:27.413
CARSON, YOU'LL NEED TO FINISH

24:27.448 --> 24:28.344
WITH A SCORE BETTER THAN 5:50 TO
BE THE NEXT H.O.H.

24:28.379 --> 24:28.620
GUESS WHO JUST BLEW EVERYONE
OUT OF THE WATER?

24:28.655 --> 24:28.931
AGAIN.

24:28.965 --> 24:30.034
MIESHA.

24:30.068 --> 24:32.827
I REALLY HOPE THAT CARSON CAN
PULL IT OUT THIS WEEK.

24:32.862 --> 24:36.655
I'M DEPENDING ON HIM AND WHAT
LITTLE OF ALLIANCE WE HAVE LEFT

24:36.689 --> 24:37.965
AT THIS POINT.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.379
IS DEPENDING ON HIM.

24:39.413 --> 24:49.655
LET'S SEE WHAT YOUR TIME WAS.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.689
10 MINUTES AND 30 SECONDS.

24:51.724 --> 24:52.172
GOOD JOB.

24:52.206 --> 24:53.172
ALL RIGHT!

24:53.206 --> 24:56.206
THAT MEANS, MIESHA, YOU'RE
THE NEXT H.O.H.

24:56.241 --> 24:56.965
<i>[ APPLAUSE ].</i>

24:59.275 --> 25:00.137
GOOD JOB!

25:00.172 --> 25:01.241
CONGRATULATIONS!

25:01.275 --> 25:04.275
I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M
SURPRISED, BUT LOOK WHO WON

25:04.310 --> 25:06.517
THEIR SECOND H.O.H.

25:06.551 --> 25:08.931
THANKS FOR KEEPING MY BED WARM.

25:08.965 --> 25:11.068
I PAINTED MY NAILS BLUE TODAY.

25:11.103 --> 25:15.000
IT'S MY DAUGHTER'S FAVORITE
COLOR, AND IT WORKED OUT BEING

25:15.034 --> 25:19.586
MY GOOD LUCK CHARM BECAUSE THIS
WEEK I AM SAFE.

25:19.620 --> 25:20.724
LOOK, MAYA, I'M THE H.O.H.!

25:20.758 --> 25:21.965
I LOVE YOU!

25:22.000 --> 25:25.310
OKAY, MIESHA, YOU COULD HAVE
LET YOUR BOY WIN ONE THING.

25:25.344 --> 25:27.931
I WOULD HAVE REALLY LIKED TO
HAVE WON THIS.

25:27.965 --> 25:29.448
I'M NOT BITTER AT ALL.

25:29.482 --> 25:35.068
AND IF ANYBODY WAS GOING TO BEAT
MY TIME, THEN I'M GLAD THAT IT'S

25:35.103 --> 25:35.586
MIESHA.

25:35.620 --> 25:36.068
CONGRATULATIONS.

25:36.103 --> 25:37.241
YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.

25:37.275 --> 25:39.689
IS THERE ANYTHING THIS WOMAN
CAN'T DO?

25:39.724 --> 25:43.310
WHAT NEXT, IS SHE GOING TO HELP
LAND THE SPACE SHUTTLE?

25:43.344 --> 25:46.655
I MEAN, THE WOMAN IS
UNSTOPPABLE.

25:46.689 --> 25:48.620
AND THIS IS NOT GOOD NEWS.

25:48.655 --> 25:55.137
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO DO A
LOT OF, UM, CAN WE SAY

25:55.172 --> 25:55.931
ASS-KISSING?

25:55.965 --> 25:57.137
I'M JUST GOING TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.

25:57.172 --> 25:59.172
I MEAN, I CAN ALWAYS KISS SOME
ASS LATER.

26:08.862 --> 26:12.172
WOOO!

26:12.206 --> 26:12.896
OKAY.

26:12.931 --> 26:15.344
CONGRATS, CONGRATS, CONGRATS!

26:15.379 --> 26:16.172
CONGRATS.

26:16.206 --> 26:18.103
YOU DID IT AGAIN, DARLING.

26:18.137 --> 26:19.793
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

26:19.827 --> 26:22.517
LOOK WHO WON HER SECOND
H.O.H.

26:22.551 --> 26:23.482
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY!

26:23.517 --> 26:26.517
ANY H.O.H. COMP TAI GET TO
COMPETE IN, I WIN.

26:26.551 --> 26:30.482
AND NOW I'M GOING TO USE THE
POWER TO GO AFTER THE

26:30.517 --> 26:31.620
OPPOSITION.

26:31.655 --> 26:35.896
IT'S NEVER TAKEN ME THAT LONG
TO TAKE MY PANTS OFF.

26:35.931 --> 26:37.379
YOU CRUSHED IT.

26:37.413 --> 26:40.379
THERE WAS ONE SECOND WHERE I
WAS LIKE I'M NOT SITTING ON IT

26:40.413 --> 26:44.206
AND I HAD TO READJUST, AND I
THINK EVEN THAT LITTLE MOMENT

26:44.241 --> 26:45.448
WAS ENOUGH.

26:45.482 --> 26:47.413
MY GIRL MIESHA WON.

26:47.448 --> 26:50.931
I AM A LITTLE SAD THAT IT WASN'T
ME, BUT, HEY, I'M HAPPY THAT MY

26:50.965 --> 26:55.758
FINAL TWO BUDDY WON THIS BECAUSE
THAT WAY WE CAN MAKE A REALLY

26:55.793 --> 26:58.931
GREAT STRATEGIC MOVE THIS WEEK
AND GET SOMEBODY WHO IS A HUGE

26:58.965 --> 26:59.965
THREAT OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.586
I THINK YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.724
OH, WE'RE TOAST.

27:05.758 --> 27:08.862
NOW, WAIT, DO YOU GET ANOTHER
LETTER AND MORE PICTURES, TOO?

27:08.896 --> 27:09.655
I DO.

27:09.689 --> 27:12.551
SHE'S JUST A COMPETITION
BEAST.

27:12.586 --> 27:14.827
SHE JUST HAS, LIKE, HER MIN ONES
IN PLACE.

27:14.862 --> 27:17.103
AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO
PENETRATE IT.

27:17.137 --> 27:18.379
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.

27:18.413 --> 27:22.793
AND TO JUST HAVE TO SMILE AND
NOD AND WAVE, THAT'S, LIKE, VERY

27:22.827 --> 27:31.620
CHALLENGING FOR ME.

27:31.655 --> 27:33.000
WE'RE TOAST.

27:33.034 --> 27:36.172
WE'RE SO TOAST.

27:36.206 --> 27:38.137
YEAH.

27:38.172 --> 27:40.827
WE'RE DEFINITELY IN TROUBLE.

27:40.862 --> 27:42.034
MIESHA, MIESHA, MIESHA.

27:42.068 --> 27:45.000
THAT'S ALL I EVER HEAR AROUND
THIS PLACE!

27:45.034 --> 27:46.275
SHE'S INCREDIBLE.

27:46.310 --> 27:52.862
AND NOW, ME AND MY PEEPS NEED TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO

27:52.896 --> 27:54.275
STAY IN THE GAME.

27:54.310 --> 27:57.517
SHIEZ PROBABLY GOING TO PUT UP
UP YOU AND ME.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.689
OH, WELL, IT WAS FUN WHILE IT
LASTED.

27:59.724 --> 28:02.448
I COULD POTENTIALLY BE ON THE
BLOCK.

28:02.482 --> 28:05.413
HOWEVER, CHRIS KATTAN HAS MADE
IT VERY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS TO

28:05.448 --> 28:06.586
GO HOME.

28:06.620 --> 28:10.379
HE EVEN TOLD THE ENTIRE WORLD
THAT HE WANTS TO GO HOME.

28:10.413 --> 28:15.379
SO MAYBE MIESHA WILL GIVE HIM
HIS REQUEST, AND I CAN SLIDE ON

28:15.413 --> 28:18.448
BY ANOTHER WEEK.

28:18.482 --> 28:20.206
I'M GOING TO GET IN THE SHOWER.

28:20.241 --> 28:22.862
AND WASH MY LIFE.

28:22.896 --> 28:23.344
OFF.

28:23.379 --> 28:29.517
YES

28:29.551 --> 28:30.965
HELLO.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.103
I HAD, FRIEND.

28:32.137 --> 28:34.655
I'M SO EXCITED THAT YOU WON.

28:34.689 --> 28:38.793
YOU FEEL LIKE IT WAS, LIKE,
BAD FOR ME TO WIN THIS ONE?

28:38.827 --> 28:42.551
I MEAN, I THINK YOU JUST HAVE
A BIG TARGET ON YOUR BACK.

28:42.586 --> 28:44.000
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.

28:44.034 --> 28:46.172
YOU ALREADY HAD A TARGET ON
THEIR BACK.

28:46.206 --> 28:49.241
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT TARGET
WOULD HAVE FADED ANYMORE BUT I

28:49.275 --> 28:51.379
THINK IT'S NOW APPARENT THAT I
WON ANOTHER ONE.

28:51.413 --> 28:54.724
I'M JUST HAPPY IT WENT THE
WAY IT DID TODAY, AND I'M HAPPY

28:54.758 --> 29:00.758
THAT YOU'RE H.O.H. AND I CAN,
LIKE, BREATHE.

29:00.793 --> 29:04.896
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

29:04.931 --> 29:06.103
WE DODGED A BULLET.

29:06.137 --> 29:06.655
YEAH.

29:06.689 --> 29:10.241
THAT MIESHA WON IT.

29:10.275 --> 29:11.482
NOT TODRICK.

29:11.517 --> 29:15.758
IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN
BETTER FOR MY GAME IF CYNTHIA,

29:15.793 --> 29:19.793
CARSON, OR SHANNA WON, BUT I'M
REALLY GLAD THAT MIESHA BEAT OUT

29:19.827 --> 29:22.517
TODRICK, BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE I
STAND WITH MIESHA.

29:22.551 --> 29:28.896
I FEEL LIKE TODRICK IS THIS WILD
CARD THAT COULD FLIP AT ANY

29:28.931 --> 29:30.551
MINUTE.

29:30.586 --> 29:33.137
WE COULD HAVE HAD HIM OUT.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.586
YEAH, WE COULD HAVE HAD HIM

29:35.620 --> 29:36.758
OUT.

29:36.793 --> 29:38.206
I'M LIKE I SHOULD HAVE--
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T TRUST IT.

29:38.241 --> 29:39.172
YEAH, I KNOW.

29:39.206 --> 29:41.344
IT'S TOO--
IT'S FINE, BECAUSE IF I CAN

29:41.379 --> 29:44.344
JUST MAKE IT PAST FRIDAY, SHE
CAN'T PLAY IN THE H.O.H. FRIDAY

29:44.379 --> 29:47.931
NIGHT.

29:47.965 --> 29:50.413
IT'S, LIKE, COME ON.

29:50.448 --> 29:52.965
SHE OWES ME TO KEEP ME IN THIS
WEEK.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.034
WELL, THINK ABOUT THIS, OUR
LAST-DITCH EFFORT.

29:56.068 --> 29:59.034
IS THIS WEEK.

29:59.068 --> 30:02.965
IS GET OUT CHRIS KATTAN THIS
WEEK.

30:03.000 --> 30:10.655
AND THEN EITHER ME, YOU,
CYNTHIA, OR CARSON.

30:10.689 --> 30:11.379
WINS THE H.O.H.

30:11.413 --> 30:16.000
WE HAVE A SHOT.

30:22.724 --> 30:23.965
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS FIRST

30:24.000 --> 30:27.034
FIGHTING IT WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW,
THE COMMENTS IN THE AUDIENCE,

30:27.068 --> 30:28.689
NOBODY TOOK WOMEN M.M.A.

30:28.724 --> 30:29.310
SERIOUSLY.

30:29.344 --> 30:30.965
YOU HAVE TO BE JOKING ME.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.206
NOBODY COULD UNDERSTAND WHY
WOULD YOU PICK FIGHTING FOR A

30:33.241 --> 30:34.000
LIVING?

30:34.034 --> 30:35.827
"BUT YOU'RE TOO PRETTY TO
FIGHT."

30:35.862 --> 30:41.206
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SIT
HOME AND BE PRETTY AND DAINTY.

30:41.241 --> 30:43.724
AND COOK MY WHOLE LIFE.

30:43.758 --> 30:45.517
I HAD TO WORK REALLY HARD.

30:45.551 --> 30:49.655
I'VE HAD TO REALLY CLAW MY WAY
TO THE TOP.

30:49.689 --> 30:52.862
LIKE, I DIDN'T GROW UP WITH,
LIKE, MONEY AND OPPORTUNITY.

30:52.896 --> 30:54.241
IT WAS JUST MY MOM AND I.

30:54.275 --> 30:55.758
SHE WAS A SINGLE MOM.

30:55.793 --> 30:58.655
AND, LIKE, THE ALL THE HEAT HAD
BEEN SHUT OFF BECAUSE SHE WAS

30:58.689 --> 31:00.275
TOO POOR TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD
THE HEAT.

31:00.310 --> 31:01.206
YEAH.

31:01.241 --> 31:03.310
SO, LIKE, THE TOILETS WERE
FROZEN OVER.

31:03.344 --> 31:04.620
OH, WOW.

31:04.655 --> 31:09.068
I'M JUST GLAD I HAD A MOM WHO
ENCOURAGED ME AND SUPPORTED ME.

31:09.103 --> 31:12.586
SHE ALWAYS ENCOURAGED, EVEN WHEN
SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND, AND SHE

31:12.620 --> 31:14.068
NEVER HELD ME BACK.

31:14.103 --> 31:16.931
AND SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT.

31:16.965 --> 31:23.965
REPUBPERSON THAT BELIEVED IN MY FROM
DAY ONE.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.206
AND, YOU KNOW, SHE SCROUNGED UP
THE MONEY FOR A $20 PAIR OF

31:28.241 --> 31:28.827
WRESTLING SHOES.

31:28.862 --> 31:30.275
I HAD THEM ALL FOUR YEARS.

31:30.310 --> 31:33.172
GOT ANOTHER PAIR, STILL HAVE
THEM.

31:33.206 --> 31:33.965
AND I'M GRATEFUL.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
LIKE, I WOULD NOT CHANGE IT AT
ALL.

31:36.034 --> 31:38.551
THERE WERE DEFINITELY A COUPLE
OF YEARS THERE WHERE MY MOM AND

31:38.586 --> 31:42.137
I, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T SEE EYE
TO EYE, AND I WAS SO STUBBORN.

31:42.172 --> 31:45.413
I WONDER WHO I GET THAT FROM.

31:45.448 --> 31:50.758
AND MAO I FEEL LIKE I NEED MY
MOM MORE THAN I EVEN DID WHEN I

31:50.793 --> 31:52.034
WAS A LITTLE KID.

31:52.068 --> 31:56.206
MY BIGGEST RIVAL, RHONDA, SHE
GREW UP IN VENICE AND, LIKE, SHE

31:56.241 --> 31:57.827
HAS WORKED VERY HARD.

31:57.862 --> 31:59.620
CAN NEVER TAKE ANYTHING AWAY
FROM HER.

31:59.655 --> 32:03.068
BUT YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE TO HAVE HAD

32:03.103 --> 32:07.896
PARENTS THAT COULD AFFORD TO PUT
YOU IN THAT KIND OF TRAINING.

32:07.931 --> 32:12.482
I'M LIVING A LIFE THAT I'M SO
GRATEFUL FOR BECAUSE OF MY

32:12.517 --> 32:15.034
MOTHER TESM MEG TO DREAM BIG,
AIM FOR THE MOON.

32:15.068 --> 32:18.241
IF YOU FAIL, YOU LAND IN THE
STARS ANYWAY.

32:18.275 --> 32:20.000
AND I'VE DONE THAT.

32:20.034 --> 32:23.068
I REALLY THRIVED IN ADVERSITY,
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I GOT WHERE

32:23.103 --> 32:24.275
I'M AT.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.931
I WAS TRAINED THE HARDER IT IS,
THE BETTER IT IS FOR YOU.

32:25.965 --> 32:31.862
YEAH.

32:31.896 --> 32:42.586
NOTHING RELAXES ME MORE THAN

32:42.620 --> 32:44.379
A NICE, LONG BATH.

32:44.413 --> 32:49.103
AND IN CASE YOU COULDN'T TELL,
IT'S A LITTLE STRESSFUL UP IN

32:49.137 --> 32:50.310
HERE.

32:50.344 --> 32:54.689
SO I'M VERY EXCITED TO JUST
LUXURIATE AND WASH THE STRESS

32:54.724 --> 33:01.551
AWAY.

33:01.586 --> 33:03.862
THAT'S NIECE.

33:03.896 --> 33:06.965
WASH ALL THAT STRESS AWAY.

33:07.000 --> 33:12.379
I LIKE TO EXFOLATE ALL THE BAD
JUJU OFF OF ME AND, YOU KNOW,

33:12.413 --> 33:17.000
START FRESH WITH BABY SOFT SKIN.

33:17.034 --> 33:21.586
I LIKE TO EXPERIMENT WITH
DIFFERENT HAIR STYLES WHEN I'M

33:21.620 --> 33:25.206
IN THE BATH, AND THERE'S NOTHING
MORE FUN THAN LATHERING UP AND

33:25.241 --> 33:27.034
CREATING A SHAMPOO MOHAWK.

33:27.068 --> 33:30.448
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COMMIT TO IT,
YOU KNOW, BUT YOU GET A LITTLE

33:30.482 --> 33:36.310
TASTE OF BEING A BAD ASS.

33:36.344 --> 33:41.793
THE BUBBLE BATH CAN NOT ONLY
CLEANSE THE BODY BUT CLEANSE THE

33:41.827 --> 33:42.137
SOUL.

33:42.172 --> 33:42.965
ALL RIGHT.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.793
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE JUST
FINE.

33:45.827 --> 34:02.000
SOS WHEN THE--

34:17.068 --> 34:17.758
THE NOMINATIONS?

34:17.793 --> 34:18.103
GOOD QUESTION.

34:18.137 --> 34:19.931
TODAY.

34:19.965 --> 34:20.793
SOMETIME.

34:20.827 --> 34:24.827
DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE DOING?

34:24.862 --> 34:26.310
CAN I TRUST YOU?

34:26.344 --> 34:28.517
I DON'T KNOW.

34:28.551 --> 34:30.413
A GOOD WAY TO FIND OUT, THEN.

34:30.448 --> 34:31.896
YEAH, YOU CAN TRUST ME.

34:31.931 --> 34:36.931
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING UP,
CHRIS.

34:36.965 --> 34:40.206
I'M NOT GUNNING FOR CHRIS
KATTAN.

34:40.241 --> 34:42.827
HE'S NOT A THREAT TO ME AT THIS
POINT.

34:42.862 --> 34:44.655
I CAME HERE TO WIN "CELEBRITY
BIG BROTHER."

34:44.689 --> 34:49.241
I WANT TO GIVE HIM A HEADS UP,
AT LEAST FOR THESE INITIAL

34:49.275 --> 34:50.413
NOMINATIONS, HE'S SAFE.

34:50.448 --> 34:52.689
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF
SOMEBODY WINS, YOU KNOW, VETO.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.827
THE HOUSE IS VERY DIVIDED.

34:54.862 --> 34:59.172
AS A MATTER OF FACT, MOSTLY
EVERYONE IS IN MIESHA'S CAMP,

34:59.206 --> 35:01.689
AND IF CHRIS KATTAN IS SAFE,
THAT MEANS I'M NOT.

35:01.724 --> 35:07.724
SO NOW THAT THIS INFORMATION HAS
BASICALLY FALLEN INTO MY LAP, I

35:07.758 --> 35:10.758
NEED TO TAKE IT TO CARSON,
BECAUSE I THINK CARSON AND I

35:10.793 --> 35:12.965
SHOULD BE WORRIED.

35:13.000 --> 35:13.379
CARSON?

35:13.413 --> 35:14.758
HI, THERE.

35:14.793 --> 35:16.000
HELLO.

35:16.034 --> 35:20.793
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO
BE MIESHA COMING TO TALK TO ME

35:20.827 --> 35:23.862
AND BE LIKE, "I'M PUTTING YOU UP
AS A PAWN."

35:23.896 --> 35:25.689
I HAVE AN UPDATE.

35:25.724 --> 35:26.241
I OVERHEARD SOMETHING.

35:26.275 --> 35:27.482
SPILL IT.

35:27.517 --> 35:35.034
I OVERHEARD KATTAN ASK MIESHA
"HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHO

35:35.068 --> 35:38.965
YOU'RE PUTTING UP?"
AND SHE WAS LIKE, "IT'S NOT YOU.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.586
YOU'RE NOT GOING UP."

35:40.620 --> 35:41.413
WHAT?

35:41.448 --> 35:44.068
I HEARD IT WITH MY OWN TWO
EARS.

35:44.103 --> 35:48.034
ALL I CAN THINK IS RUH-RO.

35:48.068 --> 35:49.034
PROBABLY YOU AND ME.

35:49.068 --> 35:49.655
OF COURSE.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.034
WELL--
TO SEPARATE US.

35:51.068 --> 35:54.172
I KNOW I'M JUST GOING TO
CONTINUE TO BE NICE.

35:54.206 --> 35:57.862
LET THE CHIPS LAND WHERE THEY
MAY.

36:26.758 --> 36:28.137
DID YOU FALL?

36:28.172 --> 36:29.724
I KIND OF TRIPPED.

36:29.758 --> 36:37.793
NOT TOO BAD.

36:37.827 --> 36:39.965
OH, MY GOD!

36:40.000 --> 36:44.034
YOU ALL RIGHT?

36:44.068 --> 36:44.586
YES.

36:44.620 --> 36:51.862
OH, MY GOD.

36:51.896 --> 36:55.172
HILARIOUS.

36:55.206 --> 36:59.344
ARE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD
PUT UP CARSON AND CYNTHIA?

36:59.379 --> 37:02.172
I JUST WANT TO GET CARSON
OUT.

37:02.206 --> 37:03.965
IS CYNTHIA REALLY A THREAT TO
US?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.034
SHE DOESN'T TALK TO ME VERY
MUCH ANYMORE.

37:06.068 --> 37:09.827
SHE DOESN'T REALLY-- LIKE, HER
ENERGY HAS CHANGED A TON.

37:09.862 --> 37:16.034
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE CYNTHIA
MIGHT NOT BE AS LOYAL TO ME AS I

37:16.068 --> 37:17.137
THINK SHE MIGHT BE.

37:17.172 --> 37:19.241
DO YOU THINK IF CHRIS
KIRKPATRICK WINS AGAIN, HE'LL

37:19.275 --> 37:20.482
TAKE A SHOT AT ME?

37:20.517 --> 37:24.517
I DO THINK THERE'S A GOOD
CHANCE HE WOULD TAKE THAT SHOT.

37:24.551 --> 37:26.931
WHEN CHRIS KIRKPATRICK WAS
H.O.H., I DID EVERYTHING THAT HE

37:26.965 --> 37:30.241
ASKED, AND FOR SOME REASON, I'M
GETTING VERY STRANGE VIBES, AND

37:30.275 --> 37:33.448
I'M FEELING A LITTLE BIT WORRIED
IF WE WERE TO WIN H.O.H. AGAIN,

37:33.482 --> 37:35.965
I MIGHT BE HIS TARGET.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.689
TARGET.

37:37.724 --> 37:38.862
I DON'T TRUST CHRIS KIRKPATRICK
ANYMORE.

37:38.896 --> 37:42.275
I KNOW I NENTIALLY WANTED TO
UPON HAD GET CARSON OUT, BUT

37:42.310 --> 37:45.034
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK IS QUICKLY
MOVING TO THE TOP OF MY TARGET

37:45.068 --> 37:46.241
LIST.

37:46.275 --> 37:47.482
YOU AND CHRIS ARE THE TWO
PEOPLE THAT I FEEL THE CLOSEST

37:47.517 --> 37:48.413
TO IN THE HOUSE.

37:48.448 --> 37:50.517
I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN
TRUST HIM NOW.

37:50.551 --> 37:54.724
I ALWAYS HAD MY ALLEGIANCE TO
YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST.

37:54.758 --> 37:57.379
TODRICK IS VERY VALID IN HOW HE
FEELS.

37:57.413 --> 38:03.034
I DID SENSE A SHIFT IN CHRIS
WHEN HE BECAME H.O.H.

38:03.068 --> 38:06.827
THERE WILL COME A POINT IN THIS
GAME WHEN WE'VE GOT TO START

38:06.862 --> 38:07.827
AIMING FOR EACH OTHER.

38:07.862 --> 38:12.379
AND THAT POINT IS COMING SOONER
THAN LATER.

38:12.413 --> 38:14.034
THINGS CHANGE IN THIS GAME.

38:14.068 --> 38:17.655
LIKE, PEOPLE'S TRUE COLORS COME
OUT A LITTLE BIT.

38:17.689 --> 38:19.965
I'M COMING FOR BLOOD.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
I WANT TO SEE THAT PICTURE TURN
BLACK AND WHITE.

38:30.275 --> 38:42.379
HEY, GUYS.

38:42.413 --> 38:54.896
IT'S TIME FOR THE NOMINATION
CEREMONY.

38:54.931 --> 39:07.482
THIS IS THE NOMINATION

39:07.517 --> 39:09.517
CEREMONY.

39:09.551 --> 39:13.551
IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE

39:13.586 --> 39:16.413
TWO HOUSEGUESTS FOR EVICTION.

39:16.448 --> 39:20.344
IN MY NOMINATION BLOCK ARE THE
KEYS OF THE HOUSEGUESTS THAT I

39:20.379 --> 39:21.793
AM NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

39:21.827 --> 39:26.172
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO LOCK IN
MY NOMINATIONS.

39:26.206 --> 39:29.758
AND THEIR FACES WILL APPEAR ON
THE MEMORY WALL.

39:29.793 --> 39:50.000
THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST THAT I HAVE
NOMINATED IS...

39:50.034 --> 40:03.793
THE NEXT HOUSEGUESTS THAT I HAVE
NOMINATED IS...

40:03.827 --> 40:08.620
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, CARSON,
AND YOU, CYNTHIA.

40:08.655 --> 40:11.931
CARSON, I THINK YOU ARE JUST
SUCH A LOVELY HUMAN BEING.

40:11.965 --> 40:14.310
AND I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED
GETTING TO KNOW YOU IN HERE.

40:14.344 --> 40:17.206
AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS,
I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE OUR

40:17.241 --> 40:18.862
FRIENDSHIP OUTSIDE OF THIS
HOUSE.

40:18.896 --> 40:21.655
CYNTHIA, I THINK YOU ARE JUST
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL AND STRONG

40:21.689 --> 40:22.620
WOMAN.

40:22.655 --> 40:24.689
AND I'VE REALLY ENJOYED GETTING
TO KNOW YOU.

40:24.724 --> 40:27.931
UNFORTUNATELY, OUR GAME JUST
HASN'T ALIGNED SO FAR INSIDE

40:27.965 --> 40:28.793
THESE WALLS.

40:28.827 --> 40:32.724
BUT I HOPE THAT IT WILL ON THE
OUTSIDE.

40:32.758 --> 40:38.482
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

40:38.517 --> 40:42.310
I FEEL LIKE CARSON IS JUST
TOO BIG OF A THREAT IN THIS

40:42.344 --> 40:43.482
GAME.

40:43.517 --> 40:47.000
IF I FAIL TO TAKE OUT CARSON
THIS WEEK, I THINK IT MAKES

40:47.034 --> 40:51.241
SENSE TO CLIP HIS OTHER WING.

40:51.275 --> 40:52.517
I GUESS I'M A THREAT.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.034
WHO KNEW?

40:54.068 --> 40:57.275
THE VETO COMP IS COMING UP, AND
IT'S REALLY OUR HAIL MARY.

40:57.310 --> 41:01.379
SO WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A
CHANCE TO STAY IN THE GAME.

41:01.413 --> 41:04.689
THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY THIS
GAME IS TO GO BIG OR GO HOME.

41:04.724 --> 41:08.655
AND NOW THAT I'M ON THE BLOCK,
IT'S TIME TO FIGHT, BECAUSE IF I

41:08.689 --> 41:12.827
GET OFF, I'M COMING FOR YOU.

41:12.862 --> 41:14.310
OH, SHE'S NOT A BO.

41:14.344 --> 41:16.689
SHE'S A WRESTLER, RIGHT?

41:16.724 --> 41:17.896
HOWEVER YOU WRESTLE.

41:17.931 --> 41:19.137
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

41:19.172 --> 41:23.137
MIESHA IS SET ON TAKING OUT A
BIG TARGET, BUT MAYBE, JUST

41:23.172 --> 41:25.896
MAYBE, SHE'S MISSING A HUGE
TARGET THAT'S SITTING RIGHT

41:25.931 --> 41:27.551
UNDERNEATH HER NOSE.

41:27.586 --> 41:31.275
I WANT MIESHA TO BE THINKING IN
THE BACK OF HER MIND THAT CHRIS

41:31.310 --> 41:33.103
KIRKPATRICK MIGHT BE A GOOD
NOMINEE.

41:33.137 --> 41:36.310
THE GAMES HAVE BEGUN!

41:36.344 --> 41:38.931
Announcer: WHO WILL WIN THE
POWER OF VETO?

41:38.965 --> 41:42.724
AND WILL IT BE USED TO SAVE
EITHER CYNTHIA OR CARSON FROM

41:42.758 --> 41:43.793
EVICTION?

41:43.827 --> 41:46.965
PLUS, WHO WILL BE THE NEXT
CELEBRITY SENT PACKING?

41:47.000 --> 41:54.172
FIND OUT FRIDAY NIGHT AT 8:00,
7:00 CENTRAL, LIVE ON "CELEBRITY

41:54.206 --> 41:57.413
