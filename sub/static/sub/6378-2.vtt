WEBVTT

00:25.275 --> 00:27.857
If you have any silver on you...

00:28.570 --> 00:30.435
...now would be the time to reveal it.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.197
No way. I ain't that stupid.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.324
Yes, you are.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.210
Is there blood in my hair?

00:48.966 --> 00:52.299
-What?
-ls there blood in my hair?

00:52.719 --> 00:55.131
I don't know, I can't see in this light.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.592
How about now?

00:58.767 --> 01:01.850
Yeah, there's a little bit
of blood in there, yeah.

01:02.020 --> 01:05.262
This is bad. Pam is gonna kill me.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.481
Who the fuck is Pam?

01:09.820 --> 01:11.105
Why, do you wanna meet her?

01:11.280 --> 01:14.238
No. No, I'm good.

01:14.658 --> 01:15.898
Well, you're going to.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.701
-Where are you taking me?
-To find out what you know.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.292
I wouldn't try anything rash
if I were you.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.502
I'm still hungry.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.056
Another first.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.973
How do you mean?

03:13.151 --> 03:16.439
We've never had make-up sex before.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.901
How does it compare to
"you thought I was dead" sex?

03:20.075 --> 03:22.441
That was pretty great too...

03:22.619 --> 03:24.951
...but I wouldn't want to
go through that again.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.454
I hated feeling like I'd lost you.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.865
And yet you like fighting with me.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.125
I don't like it, it's just--

03:32.295 --> 03:34.957
Let's not get too used to it then.

03:35.340 --> 03:39.128
-We don't want to be one of those couples.
-You're right.

03:40.804 --> 03:44.422
Holy S, I am so embarrassed
I could die.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.260
What is it?

03:46.435 --> 03:49.973
Jessica. I completely forgot she was here.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.559
-Think she heard us?
-No.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.816
If she had, she'd have no compunction
about letting us know it.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.819
You know, you might want to try
going a little easier on her.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.105
It's hard enough being
a teenage girl without--

04:01.283 --> 04:04.150
-She is a vampire, Sookie.
-So are you.

04:04.327 --> 04:08.320
And yet parts of your former self
are still in there, right?

04:08.498 --> 04:11.114
I wouldn't be with you if they weren't.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.249
Yes.

04:14.588 --> 04:19.878
But I've had to work extremely hard
at finding my way back to my humanity.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.000
Fragile as it may be.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.172
When a vampire's as new as Jessica is...

04:27.350 --> 04:29.841
...she has no humanity.

04:31.563 --> 04:35.897
She's in the grips of an oven/vhelming
number of transformations.

04:37.027 --> 04:41.316
There will be times when she cannot
control even a single impulse.

04:41.656 --> 04:44.318
Believe me, she has many.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.947
How is that any different
from being a teenage girl?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.237
No humanity, check.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.282
In the grips of oven/vhelming
transformations, check.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.916
Cannot control impulses, check.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.873
All right, how is that different?

04:58.048 --> 05:01.040
All right, so what do you suggest I do?

05:01.218 --> 05:02.583
Just spoil the girl?

05:02.761 --> 05:05.093
Give in to her every whim and desire?

05:05.263 --> 05:07.970
After all, that is what every
teenage girl wants, isn't it?

05:08.141 --> 05:10.553
You don't have to be sarcastic
with me, Bill Compton.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.013
You should at least
think about what I'm saying...

05:13.188 --> 05:16.146
...if for no other reason
than what you're doing right now...

05:16.316 --> 05:17.977
...isn't working out so hot.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.063
Kind of ironic.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.233
We promised each other
we weren't gonna fight anymore...

05:27.911 --> 05:30.243
...and yet here we are.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.198
This isn't a fight.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.368
Yes, it is.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.789
Well, then...

05:43.009 --> 05:45.091
...prepare to be made up to.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.600
This is a disaster. We'll have to go
much shorterthan I planned.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.860
Yeah, well, I said I was sorry, Pam.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.146
But he took silver to me.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.110
You were there, you saw it. Defend me.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.400
I don't know what it is
you wanna know...

06:10.579 --> 06:13.286
...but point me in the direction,
and I'll give it to you.

06:15.458 --> 06:19.451
I've seen your website.
It's quite low rent.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.542
But your clients miss you, Lafayette.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.253
They're wondering
if you're ever coming back.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.633
Am I?

06:32.434 --> 06:36.598
I'm here because of the V, right? How about
I give you the names of everybody I sold to?

06:36.771 --> 06:39.604
And all this time I thought prostitutes
were good at keeping secrets.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.311
Don't get it twisted, honey cone,
I'm a survivor first...

06:42.485 --> 06:45.318
...a capitalist second,
and a bunch of other shit after that.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.989
But a hooker, dead last.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.149
So if I got even
a Jew-at-an-al-Qaeda-pep-rally shot...

06:50.327 --> 06:53.364
...at getting my black ass out
of this motherfucker, I'm taking it.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.449
Now, what you wanna know?

06:55.624 --> 06:58.331
The vampire you had
your little arrangement with...

06:58.501 --> 07:00.332
...Eddie Fournier.

07:00.879 --> 07:01.914
What happened to him?

07:02.923 --> 07:04.254
I don't know.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.665
I swear to God I don't.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.260
Last time I saw him
he was doing real good.

07:11.348 --> 07:16.342
But I think he may have been
taken by somebody.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.930
By whom?

07:18.104 --> 07:20.846
I don't know. I mean, I ain't sure.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.479
Well, that's not very forthcoming of you.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.816
-Chow, you're up.
-No, no. Chill out. Shit.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.200
I think it--

07:34.371 --> 07:37.078
I think it was...

07:37.248 --> 07:39.284
...Jason Stackhouse.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.332
Jason Stackhouse?

07:41.503 --> 07:44.210
Sookie's brother. Could be fun?

07:45.590 --> 07:48.081
Fun, yes. But also stupid.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.921
Sookie is too important to us.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.919
That is true.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.305
Sadly, this information
is of no use to me.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.340
Not now, anyway.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.384
I understand dealers of vampire blood...

07:59.562 --> 08:03.475
...sometimes trade product
with one another across state lines.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.395
Any buyers in the Dallas area?

08:06.569 --> 08:08.821
Yes, one.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.525
He never gave me his name though.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.439
l have an e-mail address:

08:12.617 --> 08:15.859
pussylover9@shemale.com.

08:18.623 --> 08:23.333
A friend of mine in the Dallas area,
his name is Godric, has gone missing.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.415
Now, while the circumstances
of his disappearance are unclear...

08:26.589 --> 08:29.296
...it stands to reason
his blood would be very valuable...

08:29.467 --> 08:33.335
...as he's over twice my age
and 10 times the vampire I will ever be.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.128
Oh, Eric, you don't do humble well.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.513
l was not being humble,
this happens to be true.

08:39.436 --> 08:43.099
Your associate, this "pussylover."

08:43.440 --> 08:46.273
Has he or she mentioned
any new product coming on the market?

08:46.443 --> 08:49.150
No. No.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.936
And I would tell you. You know that.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.401
Chow, take our guest
and lock him back up.

08:54.576 --> 08:55.907
Fuck that!
I ain't going back.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.863
-I gave you everything!
-You gave me nothing!

08:58.038 --> 08:59.903
I'm not going back!

09:00.331 --> 09:01.992
Chow, now.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.615
No! No!

09:03.793 --> 09:06.626
I gave you everything!

09:06.796 --> 09:09.048
I gave you everything!

09:09.215 --> 09:11.422
I ain't going back down! No!

09:31.112 --> 09:32.613
Hi there.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.443
Luke McDonald.
No relation to the restaurant.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.073
Okay.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.620
Any relation to the farm?

09:40.205 --> 09:41.991
What farm?

09:42.874 --> 09:43.909
Never mind.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.166
Jason Stackhouse. Nice to meet you.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.667
You play ball?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.247
Oh, yeah.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.502
What position?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.880
QB one, actually.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.337
Tight end. Second team all-American.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.754
I don't doubt it, man. Look at you.
You'd make one hell of a target.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.092
I'd have locked onto you.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.881
Yeah, you would have.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.846
Blew my knee out,
freshman year at college.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.100
Texas A&M.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.354
You had the scholarship and everything?

10:08.525 --> 10:11.642
Yup. Everything happens for a reason.

10:11.820 --> 10:15.028
If it weren't for my knee,
I'd have never found my true calling.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.565
And it might have taken me
three solid years of Bible study...

10:18.743 --> 10:21.359
...and abstinence
and applying and reapplying to do it...

10:21.538 --> 10:23.369
...but it was all worth it.

10:23.540 --> 10:27.909
It all led me to this moment right here,
getting on this here bus.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.871
Yeah.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.372
How about you?

10:34.551 --> 10:37.884
When did you set your heart on going
to the leadership conference?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.428
Two days ago.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.973
-Two days ago?
-Yeah.

10:44.144 --> 10:48.137
Well, I didn't know about it till then. I was
having breakfast with Steve and Sarah...

10:48.314 --> 10:50.225
...and they asked me
if I wanted to come.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.393
You had breakfast with Steve and Sarah?

10:54.571 --> 10:55.936
Yeah.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.442
What?

10:58.616 --> 11:02.234
I'll tell you what. With luck like yours,
maybe some of it will rub off on me.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.902
You wanna bunk together?

11:04.080 --> 11:06.366
-Shit, yeah.
-Don't say "shit."

11:06.541 --> 11:08.406
-Shit?
-No, it's okay.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.327
-Right.
-|t's okay. Forgive yourself.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.085
Let's sing.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.765
Oh, hey. I was wondering
when you were gonna wake up.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.520
Come here.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.107
-What?
-You smell nasty and nice...

11:35.278 --> 11:37.940
...all at the same time.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.070
Okay.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.108
So when l was going to sleep
last night...

11:43.286 --> 11:45.948
...I realized
I don't know that much about you.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.613
And I kind of want to before....

11:52.462 --> 11:56.330
When it comes to men, I've got a history
of putting the cart so far out in front...

11:56.507 --> 11:59.795
...that the horse can't see it.
So now I'm just trying to get it right.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.168
You like me, Tara.

12:02.347 --> 12:05.009
-No, I know you do.
-Of course I like you.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.139
Take a shower in your sweat, if I could.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.846
Okay.

12:09.020 --> 12:13.514
Well, then, I mean, we've known each other
for what now, a couple weeks?

12:13.691 --> 12:16.478
I mean, people usually take years
unloading their baggage.

12:16.653 --> 12:20.521
-l'm trying to figure out what's the rush.
-The rush is l was just curious.

12:20.698 --> 12:25.317
Now | see how bad you want to avoid it,
| ain'tjust curious anymore, I'm worried.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.907
Okay. I don't have a job.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.322
I already figured that out.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.915
Get to the good stuff.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.872
Okay.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.666
The day we met...

12:37.840 --> 12:41.833
...remember I told you l was worse off
than you when Maryann found me?

12:42.011 --> 12:43.626
Well, the truth is l was...

12:44.514 --> 12:47.506
...living under a freeway overpass
without a penny in my pocket.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.096
That's a penny I still
don't have today, by the way.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.226
I don't care about money.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.351
I spent some time in prison.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.812
What for?

12:59.195 --> 13:00.856
Drugs.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.692
Possession or dealing?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.532
I gotta pick one?

13:07.161 --> 13:08.742
Okay.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.289
Colorful.

13:14.669 --> 13:18.787
And I also served some time
for armed robbery and assault.

13:19.549 --> 13:22.791
But I got out early on the assault charge
for good behavior, 30....

13:22.969 --> 13:24.834
That's a plus.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.382
Hey, you wanted to know.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.971
Our own Mary Simmons
spoke to the parents...

13:36.149 --> 13:38.891
...at their home in Shreveport
earlier today.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.899
If anyone has seen our daughter...

13:42.155 --> 13:44.521
...or even if you're the person
who took her...

13:44.699 --> 13:46.109
...she's our ﬁrst-born.

13:46.284 --> 13:49.117
And she’s a goodhearted, smart girl...

13:49.287 --> 13:54.372
...Who’s never done anything to harm
anybody. So please just bring her home.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.409
We just want to see our baby again.

13:57.587 --> 14:00.795
Another harrowing appeal
from young Jessica Hamby's mother.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.923
Our hearts and prayers
go out to her entire family tonight...

14:04.093 --> 14:07.631
...as I’m sure yours do too. Back to you.

14:37.627 --> 14:41.415
And so it is with open arms
that Steve and | welcome all of you...

14:41.589 --> 14:44.205
...to the Light of Day
leadership conference.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.342
Tomorrow's leaders today.

14:47.512 --> 14:50.720
Amanda will be coming around
with your ring of honesty.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.632
Your ring symbolizes the promise...

14:53.810 --> 14:55.471
-...we ask you to keep.
-Welcome.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.602
-To us and to yourselves.
-Thank you.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.983
That you will always be
completely honest and open...

15:03.152 --> 15:05.108
...while here on this campus.

15:05.279 --> 15:10.148
Also, bear in mind
that your ring is made out of real silver.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.447
So protect it with all your heart.

15:13.621 --> 15:17.034
And maybe one day,
your ring will protect you.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.665
Die, fangers!

15:20.253 --> 15:22.335
Now, some of you
already have friends here...

15:22.505 --> 15:26.214
...but most of you probably don't.
And this is nothing to worry about.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.046
Because you will all be fast friends...

15:29.220 --> 15:33.429
...as you all have one thing in common.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.591
Because for every one of you...

15:37.061 --> 15:42.601
...today is the day his holy light
begins to shine on you.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.016
Amen.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.020
Amen, brother!

15:49.449 --> 15:51.531
-Amen.
-That's right, reverend.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.860
Oh, whoopsy darn it.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.494
You'll get the hang of it.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.371
Shoot

16:00.334 --> 16:02.541
-You're late.
-Sorry.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.044
How about me? Am I on time?

16:05.214 --> 16:07.000
I'm gonna go punch in.

16:08.384 --> 16:12.548
l was in and out of here so fast last night,
I barely got a look at the place. It's...

16:12.722 --> 16:14.678
It's so....

16:17.727 --> 16:18.762
Vibrant.

16:18.936 --> 16:22.394
Well, thanks for your concern,
but there's a big rodeo in Monroe today.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.521
So that's why we're slow.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.899
Well, Tara says
the food here is wonderful...

16:27.069 --> 16:30.561
...so let's see what I'm in the mood for.

16:33.117 --> 16:36.359
-My first table. Wish me luck.
-You know what, Daphne? I got this one.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.822
-Are you sure?
-You just--

16:37.997 --> 16:41.615
You just focus
on one thing at a time. Okay?

16:44.378 --> 16:47.165
Any of you guys
pick those up the other day?

16:48.382 --> 16:50.759
Stop fucking with me.

16:52.595 --> 16:55.553
Tableside visit from the owner himself.
I must be important.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.679
I want you to leave.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.434
You're not really
gonna refuse me service, are you?

17:01.604 --> 17:04.391
I mean, after I forgave you
a hundred-thousand dollar loan...

17:04.565 --> 17:07.557
...the least you could do
is let me buy myself some lunch.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.028
What can I get you?

17:13.199 --> 17:16.783
I think | Will go with...

17:16.953 --> 17:20.116
...the stuffed snapper
with the crawfish topping...

17:20.289 --> 17:23.247
...the blackened rib eye,
the red beans and rice...

17:23.417 --> 17:26.625
...the fried catfish, and-- Oh, dear.

17:26.796 --> 17:30.254
Now, would it be possible to get
the smothered pork chops for lunch...

17:30.424 --> 17:33.131
...even though it's listed here
under the dinner entrees?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.797
Now, how are your--?

17:35.972 --> 17:37.132
Hallelujah!

17:46.649 --> 17:48.981
That's how you capture the flag.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.603
Luke.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.776
Go, go, go!

18:05.334 --> 18:06.494
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

18:16.762 --> 18:18.502
Capture that.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.814
All right, let's see some hustle!

18:31.235 --> 18:34.398
I wanna see a flag get captured.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.158
Here comes Stackhouse. He's back.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.168
Yeah.

18:59.347 --> 19:02.089
-| see you. Come on.
-Right there.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.059
Yeah!

19:04.226 --> 19:06.217
Bring it in, guys.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.519
That's what I'm talking about.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.737
-Hey.
-Sookie, what are you doing here?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.777
-I thought it was your day off.
-It is.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.664
How many times l have to tell you coming
in when you don't have to is pathetic?

19:28.834 --> 19:31.041
It's like going to school
and visiting teachers.

19:31.212 --> 19:34.750
I didn't come to see my teachers,
I came to see you. So come on.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.835
-Take a break.
-Sam will be pissed.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.250
-He's always pissed.
-When I don't have order--

19:39.428 --> 19:41.760
-l'm losing it, Sam.
-Terry, come on. What is this?

19:41.931 --> 19:45.765
It ain't my fault. How the hell
am I supposed to read her writing?

19:46.894 --> 19:48.179
Daphne.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.514
Daphne!

20:45.453 --> 20:46.533
Motherfucker.

22:20.798 --> 22:24.211
So basically, you're, like,
a stepmother to a vampire?

22:24.385 --> 22:26.250
Okay, you did notjust call me that.

22:28.514 --> 22:31.381
-What about you? How have you been?
-Oh, Sook.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.596
-l'm confused.
-About what?

22:34.770 --> 22:37.762
You know I've been living at Maryann's
for the last couple weeks?

22:37.940 --> 22:38.929
I do.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.394
Well, in a lot of ways,
I don't ever wanna leave.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.810
I mean, everything
is taken care of for me there.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.899
My bed gets made,
my laundry gets done...

22:46.073 --> 22:48.735
...there's breakfast on the patio
served to you by a chef.

22:48.909 --> 22:51.446
-Can I move in?
-Seriously, right?

22:51.620 --> 22:53.076
But it scares me too.

22:53.247 --> 22:56.614
And maybe that's just because
I'm not used to taking and not giving...

22:56.792 --> 23:01.707
...but something inside me says,
"This is weird, Tara. Don't trust it."

23:01.881 --> 23:03.212
What do you think?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.839
Does all this sound
too good to be true to you?

23:06.010 --> 23:07.841
I think before I answer that...

23:08.012 --> 23:11.425
...I have to tell you I may have
a conflict of interest in all this.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.927
-Conflict of interest?
-Yeah.

23:14.101 --> 23:19.095
See, the main reason
I came to see you today was--

23:20.983 --> 23:25.443
Tara Thornton,
would you like to move in with me?

23:25.821 --> 23:27.607
Really? Are you serious?

23:27.781 --> 23:29.942
Of course I'm serious.
It would be so much fun.

23:30.117 --> 23:34.030
We know we get along. When we were kids,
you slept over more often than you didn't...

23:34.204 --> 23:36.661
...and we never wanted to pull
each other's hair out.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.619
That's where you're wrong.
I was always jealous of your hair.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.500
-I thought about cutting it while you slept.
-You did not.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.832
Oh, yes, I did.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.123
So--? So, what do you think?

23:47.301 --> 23:49.587
Because I've been trying
to get my act together...

23:49.762 --> 23:52.674
...to move into Gran's room
for the past couple weeks...

23:52.848 --> 23:56.432
...and your moving in might be
the kick in the butt I need to do it.

23:59.605 --> 24:00.720
Daphne!

24:00.898 --> 24:03.605
That's right on my feet.
How am I supposed to ignore that?

24:03.776 --> 24:06.688
-I'm sorry.
-If you wanna make it to Bill's tonight...

24:06.862 --> 24:08.978
...get out of here
before Sam asks you to stay.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.487
You're probably right.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.240
Hi, Sam. Bye, Sam.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.913
Is this the infamous Sookie?

24:20.084 --> 24:21.995
Sookie, Maryann. Maryann, Sookie.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.286
-|t's nice to meet you.
-Oh, likewise.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.625
Oh, you're very special, you know.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.712
I mean, to have been through
everything you have in your life...

24:30.886 --> 24:34.128
...not to mention the last few weeks,
and to emerge from it walking...

24:34.306 --> 24:36.388
...let alone smiling, it's--

24:36.558 --> 24:39.516
Well, it's simply astonishing.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.933
I see what you mean about her, Tara.

24:46.777 --> 24:49.484
She has an old soul, doesn't she?

24:52.574 --> 24:56.032
I'm sorry. I'm usually good
at placing people's accents...

24:56.203 --> 24:58.819
...but yours I can't get a handle on.
Where are you from?

24:59.957 --> 25:01.072
Cape Cod.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.909
Best potato chips in the world.

25:08.590 --> 25:12.082
Well, I'd love to stay and chat,
but I'm running late.

25:12.261 --> 25:16.049
Tara, let me know what you decide
about moving in, all right?

25:16.223 --> 25:18.384
Because I think it'd be really great.

25:22.563 --> 25:26.727
She asked you to move in with her?
That was awfully nice.

25:26.900 --> 25:31.269
Yeah, but I don't know
what I'm doing, so....

25:55.804 --> 25:56.839
No.

25:59.308 --> 26:02.721
-Who the fuck are you?
-Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.305
Well?

26:05.397 --> 26:08.264
It's daytime. Thank you, Jesus.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.148
Thank you, God. You're human, right?

26:10.569 --> 26:14.278
Kind of. But I ain't letting you go,
if that's what you're thinking.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.235
Well, look at you.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.741
Not only is you sexy...

26:19.912 --> 26:23.655
...but you can read minds too. That getting
me all riled up in my nether regions.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.823
Don't you try and flirt with me.

26:26.001 --> 26:29.994
They told me to pay special attention
to the faggot drag queen in the basement.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.288
Skank-ass bitch,
you gonna let me out of here!

26:32.466 --> 26:35.833
I do that, I'm good as dead,
and you know it. Don't you move.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.593
You ain't gonna shoot me,
not with them shaky-ass hands.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.846
You ain't got the stomach for it.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.678
Bitch.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.180
Holy fucker.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.431
I'm sorry.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.189
I'm so fucking sorry.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.733
I hate guns!

26:58.242 --> 27:00.324
Hey! Hey! I'm the one who got shot.

27:00.494 --> 27:03.782
Will you quit screaming and get me
a towel before I bleed the fuck out?

27:03.956 --> 27:05.071
Okay.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.705
Goddamn.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.035
Hurry up!

27:08.210 --> 27:10.622
Motherfucker.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.380
These are all dirty.

27:12.548 --> 27:15.039
Just give me the fucking towel.

27:19.555 --> 27:22.888
-Yeah, yeah. All right.
-Yeah.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.730
Yeah.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.365
Yeah.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.929
Praise Jesus.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.349
In his name!

28:26.288 --> 28:28.449
Praise him.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.786
Oh, yeah.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.637
One more!

28:43.055 --> 28:47.139
-Praise Jesus!
-Thank you, everybody. Honesty.

28:47.309 --> 28:48.719
Honesty, babe.

28:48.894 --> 28:52.853
Let's hear it again
for our very own Amanda Jane.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.643
-You did very good, honey.
-Amen.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.148
-Excellent.
-Praise Jesus.

28:57.319 --> 29:01.153
-Honesty.
-That was "Jesus Asked Me Out Today."

29:01.323 --> 29:05.157
And it's on her new album,
which drops next Tuesday, is that right?

29:05.327 --> 29:07.818
Yes. Look for it at Wal-Mart,
Target, Costco.

29:07.996 --> 29:11.159
And the single's already available
for downloading on iTunes.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.699
So check it out.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.333
Thank you. Thank you.

29:15.504 --> 29:18.166
-We love you, Amanda!
-Yeah!

29:18.548 --> 29:21.790
You hate to have to follow that.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.834
All right. Go on, go on, sit down.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.924
All right, now, finally tonight,
we're gonna wind things down...

29:27.099 --> 29:31.809
...with a little game, which,
while fun, should also be instructive.

29:32.479 --> 29:35.516
Because as each of you
heads out into the world...

29:35.691 --> 29:40.025
...at some point, you will be faced
with real-life encounters...

29:40.195 --> 29:42.186
...with vampire sympathizers.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.647
-Traitor!
-Un-American!

29:44.825 --> 29:45.860
It's just not right!

29:46.034 --> 29:47.990
And we wanna make sure
that you're ready.

29:48.161 --> 29:51.244
So, Sarah, honey,
can you come on up here, please?

29:51.415 --> 29:56.830
Now, I'm gonna ask my beautiful bride
to play the part of the sympathizer.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.042
Oh, come on, y'all, it's just pretend.

30:01.216 --> 30:04.333
And Jason Stackhouse.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.378
Why don't you come on up
and play the part of the good guy?

30:07.764 --> 30:09.049
Me?

30:09.224 --> 30:11.306
Well, you captured the flag, didn't you?

30:11.476 --> 30:13.262
-Yeah!
-Yeah, Stackhouse!

30:13.437 --> 30:14.973
You the man, Jason!

30:15.147 --> 30:17.763
A gutsy guy right there.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.399
Get up there.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.781
Hello?

30:36.209 --> 30:38.416
I just saw my parents on TV.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.168
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.581
I finally get why they never wanted me
to watch it in the first place.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.590
It's horrible.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.089
-Where's Bill?
-I have no idea.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.595
All he told me was:

30:50.766 --> 30:54.600
"Jessica, I have errands to run.
Errands which do not require your presence.

30:54.770 --> 30:58.604
So remain here and do your best
to stay out of trouble while I'm gone."

30:59.691 --> 31:03.809
And I hate it here. I hate it so much.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.229
Jessica.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.617
-I think I miss them.
-Your parents?

31:23.590 --> 31:25.251
And my little sister.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.211
Who I was always...

31:27.386 --> 31:29.297
...totally horrible to...

31:32.099 --> 31:35.307
...and I was just such a brat and....

31:38.980 --> 31:43.144
-Wait, what's wrong with me?
-Sweetie, vampires don't cry regular tears.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.730
So when you cry,
you're gonna cry blood from now on.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.437
Well, why do you know that and I don't?

31:48.615 --> 31:51.197
I mean, don't you think
I should know this about myself?

31:51.368 --> 31:53.404
Bill should probably have told you.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.443
Jeez, you think?

31:57.332 --> 31:59.288
Here's some tissue.

32:00.001 --> 32:03.664
Look, I don't know if it helps at all,
but I think I kind of know how you feel.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.750
-At least a little.
-No, you don't.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.290
I'm not saying it's the same...

32:08.468 --> 32:13.679
...but I lost my gran a few weeks ago,
and she was everything to me.

32:13.849 --> 32:17.137
Everything I knew, and now she's gone.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.770
But grandparents are supposed to die,
and you're still alive.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.056
I mean, with me, I'm the one that's dead.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.099
It doesn't really matter who's dead.

32:26.862 --> 32:28.398
When people love each other...

32:28.572 --> 32:33.692
...and then suddenly one of them isn't there
anymore, it's the distance that hurts.

32:33.869 --> 32:37.157
And the distance is the same
no matter who's doing the leaving.

32:39.291 --> 32:43.159
What do you do when you feel
so far away you can't stand it?

32:43.336 --> 32:48.672
Well, sometimes I'll go into her room
and just sit there a spell.

32:49.718 --> 32:50.833
That helps?

32:51.011 --> 32:55.050
I don't know why,
butjust being someplace...

32:55.390 --> 32:57.381
...where she's been...

32:58.393 --> 33:01.226
...it makes me feel better,
at least a little bit.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.526
You think maybe you could drive me
to my parents' so that I could--

33:09.696 --> 33:11.857
I did not mean to--
You know I can't do that.

33:12.032 --> 33:15.490
Please.
I would just sit in the car, I swear.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.534
All I'm asking is to sit across the street...

33:18.705 --> 33:21.287
...and catch a glimpse of them
through the window.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.539
Just so I can say goodbye.

33:23.710 --> 33:28.124
I'm sorry. It's just not my place.
But if you explained it to Bill...

33:28.298 --> 33:32.086
...the same way you just explained it
to me, I'm sure he'd take you.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.251
Are you really sure about that?

33:34.429 --> 33:37.045
Because I'm not so sure he would.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.436
-Okay.
-Really?

33:48.610 --> 33:51.898
Yes. But we're just driving by,
and that's it.

33:52.072 --> 33:55.109
And we should swing by my place
and get you a change of clothes...

33:55.283 --> 33:57.820
...because I am not taking you
out in public like that.

33:57.994 --> 33:59.905
Thank you, Sookie.
Thank you so, so, much.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.991
Oh, don't mention it.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.739
To Bill...

34:04.918 --> 34:06.579
...ever.

34:15.470 --> 34:18.428
-I like this one, Dad.
-Fine, go try it on.

34:18.598 --> 34:21.635
You look positively lost.

34:21.810 --> 34:25.928
Yes, I do feel a little at sea.

34:26.106 --> 34:29.473
I can help you pick something out
if you'd like.

34:29.651 --> 34:33.109
You're looking for your daughter?

34:33.280 --> 34:36.898
Yes. My daughter, Jessica.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.157
Such a pretty name.

34:39.327 --> 34:42.990
What do you think of this?

34:44.374 --> 34:46.786
It's very nice, but I don't think so.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.243
My, we are conservative, aren't we?

34:50.422 --> 34:53.585
No, not really. Just old-fashioned.

34:53.758 --> 34:55.168
Don't be silly.

34:55.343 --> 34:57.425
You don't look old enough
to be old-fashioned.

34:57.596 --> 35:01.180
-Not by a long shot.
-You'd be surprised.

35:01.975 --> 35:06.093
You're funny. And cold.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.687
Well, you're not--?

35:10.483 --> 35:13.691
I am vampire, yes.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.854
Tell you what.

35:18.033 --> 35:21.196
Why don't you come with me
to the dressing room...

35:21.369 --> 35:24.031
...and I could model this for you?

35:24.205 --> 35:28.369
That's very kind of you,
but no, thank you.

35:30.253 --> 35:33.495
-You sure, now?
-I am.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.292
Good evening, old sport.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.044
Eric?

35:41.723 --> 35:43.930
It's the new me.

35:44.392 --> 35:45.928
You like?

35:46.561 --> 35:49.598
I do. Very much.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.598
Okay.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.898
We need to talk.

36:02.077 --> 36:06.036
Listen, lady, if you're gonna give them
all the rights normal people have...

36:06.206 --> 36:09.243
...then how am I supposed to protect
my sweet little girl...

36:09.417 --> 36:13.205
...from any vampire who wants to just
fly on in and marry her?

36:13.380 --> 36:15.245
-Yeah.
-You have a daughter?

36:15.423 --> 36:18.506
Well, I was a pretty bad boy...

36:18.677 --> 36:21.714
...up until the Light of Day
leadership conference.

36:23.264 --> 36:26.677
So, yeah,
it's entirely possible that I could.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.308
Well, I don't give a hoot
about your daughter.

36:29.479 --> 36:32.141
In fact, nothing you say
about vampire rights...

36:32.315 --> 36:34.431
...is gonna change my mind.

36:34.609 --> 36:35.769
Because”.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.192
...I am a vampire.

37:09.811 --> 37:11.221
Hey!

37:13.606 --> 37:14.857
I'm so sorry.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.357
It's okay.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.320
Hey, you all right?

37:23.450 --> 37:26.442
-|t's okay.
-You all right?

37:26.870 --> 37:28.326
Yeah.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.956
I got another deluxe,
I can't guarantee that it's cooked.

37:37.130 --> 37:40.998
Oh, honey, you are sweating
like a ice-water pitcher.

37:41.176 --> 37:44.339
I'm feeling the pressure, Arlene.
I don't like feeling the pressure.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.013
Well, when was your last break?

37:46.514 --> 37:48.095
I ain't taken one.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.348
I'm coming around there.

37:50.518 --> 37:53.009
Daphne, order up!

37:55.940 --> 37:57.146
Fucking--

37:59.819 --> 38:01.229
-Give me your tongs.
-I'm fine.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.736
Give me your tongs.

38:04.365 --> 38:05.821
Taking a break.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.193
Be a doll,
take that out to Table 4 for me.

38:09.370 --> 38:12.032
Okay. Which one's Table 4 again?

38:14.876 --> 38:17.709
Well, I'll find it. I'll find it.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.711
-She ain't working out.
-Nope.

38:21.424 --> 38:25.212
It's funny. Most of these orders
are going out to Table 4.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.336
What the hell's going on at Table 4?

38:33.937 --> 38:37.475
Miss, miss. I think you're looking for me.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.348
I'd have stood there all night
if you hadn't noticed me.

38:40.527 --> 38:43.860
-So thanks.
-Are you new here?

38:44.030 --> 38:45.065
How could you tell?

38:45.240 --> 38:48.732
Because you care about doing a good job.
Now, you just keep on caring...

38:48.910 --> 38:51.276
...and one day
you will be the best at what you do.

38:51.454 --> 38:52.489
That's my advice.

39:06.553 --> 39:08.134
Don't you think you've had enough?

39:08.304 --> 39:09.760
I know what you're thinking.

39:10.557 --> 39:12.388
Nine years sober.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.265
Why give it all up?

39:14.435 --> 39:17.347
Well, what I got to say to that is...

39:17.772 --> 39:19.182
...why the hell not?

39:19.357 --> 39:23.566
Because the people in this town
don't need to see you this way.

39:23.945 --> 39:27.187
The people in this town don't see me.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.901
Not for what I really am.

39:29.075 --> 39:33.444
Well, how about you quit
feeling sorry for yourself and suck it up?

39:33.788 --> 39:36.530
You want respect from people,
start by respecting yourself.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.449
Bud took me off a case, Sam.

39:39.627 --> 39:43.119
I don't know about you,
but in my book that's a capital demotion.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.246
Hey, I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

39:45.425 --> 39:48.212
I'll get back on the right path tomorrow,
but tonight just...

39:48.636 --> 39:50.547
...don't cut me off, all right?

39:50.722 --> 39:52.633
No problem.

39:55.602 --> 39:58.935
One of the things I set out to do
when I opened up here...

39:59.105 --> 40:01.812
...was to have a place
where you could come, get a drink...

40:01.983 --> 40:04.440
...nobody would bother you to dance.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.359
I am with you there.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.816
I hate to dance.

40:10.325 --> 40:14.694
This one time,
I was in a club in Shreveport...

40:14.871 --> 40:17.157
...and I actually had a woman tell me...

40:17.332 --> 40:20.950
...I looked like a epileptic on meth.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.997
Never again, Sam.

40:24.839 --> 40:25.954
Never again.

41:21.729 --> 41:25.187
The sheriff of Area 9 in Texas
has gone missing.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.640
Have you heard about that?

41:26.818 --> 41:30.481
I hadn't, but I know the vampire of whom
you speak. His name is Godric, correct?

41:30.655 --> 41:32.236
Indeed.

41:33.116 --> 41:36.233
It goes without saying
he needs to be found.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.902
Which is where Sookie comes in.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.445
No.

41:40.623 --> 41:44.741
As she's yours, I'm asking your permission
to take her with me to Dallas.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.080
Eric, you can do
whatever you want with me...

41:47.255 --> 41:49.962
...but I am not putting her
in this position anymore.

41:50.133 --> 41:53.091
I cannot and will not allow you
to bring her into these matters.

41:53.261 --> 41:55.752
We made a deal, your human and I.

41:55.930 --> 42:00.299
That if I didn't kill anyone,
she would work for me as often as I like.

42:00.768 --> 42:03.760
Now, you remember this, don't you?
You were there.

42:03.938 --> 42:08.056
Taking her across state lines is a far cry
from taking her to Fangtasia for the evening.

42:08.943 --> 42:12.151
I'm only asking your permission
out of respect.

42:12.321 --> 42:14.903
If I want her, I can simply take her.

42:18.828 --> 42:20.409
Is "no" your final answer?

42:20.872 --> 42:21.952
It is.

42:24.459 --> 42:26.541
Poorly played, Bill.

42:34.343 --> 42:37.835
Here, this is it. Across the street.

42:44.729 --> 42:47.311
My daddy won't be home yet...

42:47.815 --> 42:50.727
...but my mama and sister
should be there.

42:56.157 --> 42:57.897
Jessica?

42:58.326 --> 42:59.941
Yeah?

43:03.790 --> 43:05.155
I'm sorry.

43:08.669 --> 43:11.081
Well, why are you crying?

43:11.547 --> 43:14.004
Because I did this to you.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.712
If Bill hadn't....

43:18.679 --> 43:20.089
I took your life away...

43:20.264 --> 43:23.176
...and I know there's no way
you'll ever be able to forgive me.

43:23.351 --> 43:24.841
It's not even right to ask.

43:26.521 --> 43:31.060
But I had no idea
it was gonna lead to this.

43:33.736 --> 43:35.647
I don't blame you, Sookie.

43:36.823 --> 43:39.360
How's that even possible?

43:39.534 --> 43:40.614
There's my sister.

43:41.536 --> 43:43.242
Jessica!

43:44.872 --> 43:47.033
Jessica! Get back in the car!

43:47.208 --> 43:48.698
Hello?

43:48.876 --> 43:50.867
You promised.

43:51.379 --> 43:53.665
Fault: front door.

43:54.507 --> 43:55.667
Jessica.

43:55.842 --> 43:57.673
Momma.

43:58.511 --> 44:00.001
Don't cry.

44:05.143 --> 44:07.555
-Oh, hey, Eden.
-Where were you?

44:07.728 --> 44:09.980
It doesn't matter. Just call your father...

44:10.148 --> 44:13.015
...and tell him that Jessica's home.

44:14.902 --> 44:17.735
Momma, I'd like to introduce you to my--

44:18.364 --> 44:20.480
My friend. This is Sookie.

44:21.576 --> 44:23.191
Hello, Sookie.

44:23.369 --> 44:24.575
Thank you.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.952
Thank you so much for bringing her back.

44:27.123 --> 44:28.203
You're welcome.

44:31.502 --> 44:32.912
Aren't you gonna invite us in?

44:33.087 --> 44:35.749
What? No, no, we can't stay.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.085
Honey, your arm's like ice.

44:38.551 --> 44:40.758
Come on in and I'll make you some tea.

44:40.928 --> 44:42.179
Come on.

44:55.443 --> 44:57.934
What just walked through that door?

44:58.112 --> 44:59.693
Trouble.

44:59.864 --> 45:01.604
-Hey, Tara.
-Eggs, I'm working.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.943
I know. And I'm sorry.
I got something to say...

45:04.118 --> 45:06.609
-...and I want you to hear me out.
-|'|| hear you out.

45:06.787 --> 45:09.073
Jane Bodehouse.
You are a crazy-ass drunk...

45:09.248 --> 45:11.739
...but normally you wait
for some loser to hit on you.

45:11.918 --> 45:14.330
What the hell has gotten into you?

45:14.754 --> 45:16.710
I don't know.

45:19.258 --> 45:21.465
Okay. What?

45:25.306 --> 45:26.762
All right, listen.

45:26.933 --> 45:28.844
My dad left us when I was a little kid.

45:29.018 --> 45:31.134
So I don't remember shit
about him except this.

45:31.312 --> 45:34.179
He used to always say,
"You can't get what you want in life...

45:34.357 --> 45:37.645
...so in order to get it,
you have to appear not to want it."

45:38.194 --> 45:40.355
Well, I say fuck that.

45:41.822 --> 45:45.064
I wanna be with you, Tara,
and I refuse to pretend I don't.

45:47.912 --> 45:51.325
Detective Bellefleur,
you come dance with me.

45:51.499 --> 45:52.784
I don't dance.

45:53.209 --> 45:56.326
With me you do. Come on. Come on!

45:56.504 --> 46:00.713
What the hell. It's my last night drinking.

46:05.888 --> 46:08.595
You think you walk on water, don't you?

46:10.184 --> 46:12.971
I'm pretty sure that was Moses.

46:13.562 --> 46:14.847
No, it was Jesus.

46:15.022 --> 46:16.683
Moses parted the Red Sea.

46:17.400 --> 46:20.984
And what the hell was the deal with you
snapping the American flag in half...

46:21.153 --> 46:25.738
...like you some Muslim Buffy with a dick?
That's all kinds of messed up.

46:26.033 --> 46:28.775
Well, I'm sorry you didn't like it, Mac,
but everyone else--

46:28.953 --> 46:32.036
Your being here is a joke, Stackhouse.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.281
They may not see it now, but they will.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.290
Day one might have went to you.

46:37.461 --> 46:40.077
Day two belongs to the Luke-inator.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.175
Die, fanger!

46:50.349 --> 46:54.683
-Vampire sympathizer.
-Jason Stackhouse, you're a tool of Satan.

46:55.021 --> 46:56.886
You brought me Tru Blood.

46:57.064 --> 46:59.271
-Traitor.
-Turn your back on Jesus.

46:59.442 --> 47:01.228
Just drink.

47:01.402 --> 47:02.562
Jason Stackhouse.

47:03.029 --> 47:05.896
They may not see it now, but they will.

47:07.825 --> 47:10.441
Goddamn it.

48:14.141 --> 48:17.759
-What the fuck is going on out there?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

48:17.937 --> 48:21.646
I'm talking about the dancing and the
people nearly having sex on the pool table?

48:21.816 --> 48:25.308
I don't know what to tell you. People came
back from the rodeo in a good mood?

48:25.486 --> 48:29.650
Damn it, Maryann, this is my bar,
these are my people, this is my town!

48:31.409 --> 48:35.072
Don't do that.
I've seen you do that before.

48:35.704 --> 48:36.739
Maryann.

48:39.041 --> 48:42.659
Stop it. You can't--

48:53.889 --> 48:56.141
Abracadabra, Sam.

48:56.308 --> 48:59.675
What I just did to you,
I can do anytime, anywhere.

48:59.854 --> 49:02.721
So unless you want your customers
to know your little secret...

49:02.898 --> 49:05.184
...you better think twice
before you threaten me.

49:05.359 --> 49:07.441
Do we understand each other?

49:08.279 --> 49:11.191
I don't normally cuss,
but you have completely fucked me here.

49:11.365 --> 49:14.949
I know, and I'm sorry, but I swear
it was like it wasn't even me doing it.

49:15.119 --> 49:17.701
It must be all those new vampire
impulse-control issues.

49:17.872 --> 49:19.362
Fuck your impulse-control issues.

49:19.540 --> 49:22.373
Here's some sandwiches.
Mom's still making tea.

49:22.543 --> 49:23.578
Oh, thanks, Eden.

49:23.752 --> 49:25.663
-Thank you.
-Eden, you already had dinner.

49:25.838 --> 49:28.500
-Don't touch those sandwiches.
-You're pretty.

49:28.674 --> 49:30.710
Why, that's awful nice of you.

49:30.885 --> 49:33.046
And you're very pretty yourself.

49:33.220 --> 49:35.256
No, I'm not.

49:35.431 --> 49:36.637
Got a problem with hair.

49:36.807 --> 49:39.719
Fault: front door.

49:55.701 --> 49:57.692
-How could you do this?
-Daddy.

49:58.078 --> 50:00.569
Do you have any idea
what you put your mother through?

50:00.748 --> 50:03.865
-Why, Jessica? You tell me why!
-Mr. Hamby!

50:04.043 --> 50:05.658
Or I will make you tell me!

50:05.836 --> 50:09.124
Go ahead, Daddy. Get your belt.

50:12.426 --> 50:16.214
But this time, I'll be ready for you.

50:20.851 --> 50:22.807
How much blood do you think he's lost?

50:22.978 --> 50:25.094
Oh, I still think he has something to offer.

50:25.272 --> 50:29.231
I hate to let it all go to waste like this.
Seems a shame we have to wait for Eric.

50:29.401 --> 50:32.393
Yeah, maybe one day you'll be sheriff
and you can make the rules.

50:32.571 --> 50:34.778
-I doubt that.
-Me too.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.691
Sorry to keep you waiting for so long.

50:38.911 --> 50:40.447
How's the leg?

50:40.621 --> 50:42.907
It's shitty. Thanks for asking.

50:43.082 --> 50:47.121
After all your proclamations about what
a model prisoner you were going to be...

50:47.294 --> 50:48.625
...you had to try to escape.

50:48.796 --> 50:52.288
-You were gonna kill me anyway, right?
-Well, now you'll never know.

50:53.133 --> 50:55.089
So, what's it gonna be, Lafayette?

50:55.261 --> 50:58.628
Would you like the leg to kill you,
or would you prefer us to do it?

50:58.806 --> 51:00.797
I'm gonna go with plan C.

51:02.059 --> 51:03.469
There's a plan C?

51:04.103 --> 51:05.889
Make me a vampire.

51:07.439 --> 51:08.474
I beg your pardon?

51:08.649 --> 51:11.311
And you can put me to work in the bar.

51:11.485 --> 51:14.318
I'm a good dancer.
You seen it on my site.

51:14.488 --> 51:20.154
Shit, I'll get up there
and move Earth and heaven, go-go style.

51:21.328 --> 51:24.411
You are aware
there's a gaping hole in your leg?

51:24.582 --> 51:25.822
You're damaged goods.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.161
Not if you turn me.

51:28.335 --> 51:29.450
I'll be good as ever.

51:30.796 --> 51:34.288
Look, I'm already a person...

51:34.466 --> 51:38.960
...of poor moral character,
so I'll hit the ground running.

51:39.138 --> 51:42.801
And I damn near glamour people already.

51:42.975 --> 51:47.719
Give me what y'all got,
and it's on and cracking.

51:48.439 --> 51:51.351
Not only will I be a badass vampire...

51:52.860 --> 51:56.148
...but I'll be your badass vampire.

51:56.905 --> 51:59.692
-Interesting.
-Yeah?

51:59.867 --> 52:02.483
I'll take it under advisement.

52:04.204 --> 52:05.740
Pam?

52:06.081 --> 52:07.617
Chow?

52:09.084 --> 52:11.200
Chow time.

52:18.844 --> 52:21.335
How could you let some bloodsucker
bite you like that?

52:21.513 --> 52:25.472
-Mr. Hamby!
-I didn't let anybody do anything to me.

52:25.643 --> 52:27.759
But, oh, am I glad he did.

52:27.936 --> 52:32.054
Because now I get to homeschool you
in what it's like to be scared.

52:32.608 --> 52:34.018
Jessica! Stop!

52:34.193 --> 52:36.730
Jesus Christ, Sookie.
Would you shut the fuck up?

52:36.904 --> 52:39.896
-Are you okay?
-Baby, please. This isn't you.

52:40.074 --> 52:43.407
You don't know the first thing about me.
You're too dumb to know anything.

52:43.577 --> 52:45.283
-Jessica!
-Oh, what?

52:45.454 --> 52:48.491
She is dumb. She's dumber
than a sack full of hammers...

52:48.666 --> 52:50.247
...and he's as mean as a snake.

52:50.417 --> 52:53.750
And that's the way
it's always gonna be around here.

52:58.342 --> 52:59.752
So I am ending it.

52:59.927 --> 53:02.088
Right here, right now.

53:02.262 --> 53:04.389
And I am doing it with your belt.

53:09.395 --> 53:12.637
-Daddy?
-|t's okay, baby.

53:17.778 --> 53:21.771
Don't worry.
This will only hurt for a minute.

53:23.283 --> 53:24.864
-Fault: front door.
-Bi|l!

53:25.035 --> 53:26.195
Jessica, let him go.

53:26.370 --> 53:28.531
-But--
-As your maker, I command you.

53:28.706 --> 53:30.788
God help us.

53:31.250 --> 53:32.911
-Thank God you're here.
-Shut up.

53:33.627 --> 53:36.744
Now, someone who lives here
must invite me in.

53:36.922 --> 53:39.129
No, don't, he's one of them.
He'll kill us all.

53:39.299 --> 53:41.551
-No, he won't. He's not like that.
-You.

53:42.136 --> 53:43.797
Little girl.

53:43.971 --> 53:45.586
Come here.

53:45.806 --> 53:47.091
-Eden.
-Come back here!

53:47.266 --> 53:49.097
Eden, don't.

53:52.354 --> 53:53.389
Good girl.

53:54.231 --> 53:55.641
Now, you listen to me.

53:56.275 --> 53:57.811
I'm here to protect you.

53:58.819 --> 54:02.061
You and your mother and your father.

54:02.781 --> 54:04.817
I am your friend.

54:05.492 --> 54:07.983
So you just invite me in...

54:08.162 --> 54:10.949
...and I can make everything stop.

54:12.249 --> 54:13.489
You can?

54:15.002 --> 54:16.833
Yes.

54:18.338 --> 54:19.748
Won't you please come in, sir?

54:21.633 --> 54:23.589
-I'm sorry.
-Get the hell out of here.

54:23.761 --> 54:25.843
-Bi|l.
-Now, so I can clean up your mess.

54:26.013 --> 54:27.753
-Please don't kill them.
-This is your fault.

54:27.931 --> 54:29.842
Now, get the hell out of here.
