WEBVTT

00:03.975 --> 00:05.538
You're amazing.

00:05.875 --> 00:06.692
<i>Then whispering:</i>

00:06.693 --> 00:08.019
I love you.

00:08.140 --> 00:10.090
<i>to our baby and and hoping
that Kim wasn't wondering</i>

00:10.091 --> 00:12.061
<i>why I hadn't said the same thing to her.</i>

00:14.643 --> 00:17.489
There is something that just
the diven doctors can't stomach.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.617
That is so gross. I might vomit.

00:19.705 --> 00:22.793
Oh, is that the patient with
the infected neck wound?

00:22.838 --> 00:24.315
- Worse.
- Hey guys.

00:25.202 --> 00:27.431
Like the image of your ex fiancee.

00:27.476 --> 00:29.369
- How's it going, Keith?
- You ruined my life.

00:30.124 --> 00:32.101
- See you!
- Excuse me, nurse?

00:32.709 --> 00:35.519
Could you be a doll and give Bobby
Franklin, there, a shot of penicillin?

00:36.223 --> 00:37.675
Why can't he do it himself?

00:37.940 --> 00:39.951
Because, Carla, he's Dr. "No shot".

00:40.010 --> 00:42.766
He's like the only pediatrician kids
like because he never give shots.

00:42.867 --> 00:45.897
Hey, remember when you wanted to be
the doctor who never said "terminal"?

00:47.745 --> 00:50.779
I'm sorry but your grandmother
has an inoperable brain tumor.

00:51.306 --> 00:52.444
Is it terminal?

00:52.908 --> 00:54.256
I wouldn't say that...

00:54.804 --> 00:56.824
- So she still has a chance.
- No.

00:58.228 --> 01:01.314
Yeah, it's okay. I mean, Dr. "won't say
terminal" has got all the mouthful, anyway.

01:02.478 --> 01:04.881
Didn't I tell you to treat Mr. Meltzer?

01:05.001 --> 01:06.668
Yes but he won't let us, because...

01:06.669 --> 01:10.137
No, no. Remember our new system so that
I never have to hear your voice again?

01:13.018 --> 01:17.680
"He doesn't want to be treated by interns",
with your "i" dotted with an heart

01:17.763 --> 01:20.001
and a little frowny face at the end.

01:20.068 --> 01:24.736
It's incredible, your handwriting is actually
more annoying than your voice.

01:24.954 --> 01:28.896
Regardless, you interns
are the future of this hospital,

01:29.152 --> 01:30.999
if you don't treat patients, you won't learn.

01:31.452 --> 01:35.219
What you have to do is walk over to
Mr. Mellsor and then say these words:

01:35.783 --> 01:38.095
"I'm your doctor, deal with it".

01:38.471 --> 01:39.684
Can you say that?

01:40.211 --> 01:42.239
I'm your doctor...

01:42.240 --> 01:43.990
Not you, never you.

01:46.155 --> 01:47.906
I am your doctor, deal with it.

01:48.620 --> 01:49.823
Peachy.

01:51.364 --> 01:55.329
- Why you looking so sad, now, lifer?
- You were right about Kim, I don't love her.

01:55.540 --> 01:56.813
Oh, that's tough.

01:57.093 --> 01:58.557
Do you wanna get some exercise
and clear your head?

01:58.602 --> 01:59.884
- Uh uh!
- Okay.

02:02.864 --> 02:04.309
Thanks, buddy. I needed this.

02:05.112 --> 02:08.642
- are you gonna break up with her?
- No way. we are having a baby, man.

02:09.275 --> 02:12.562
Statistics say that the kids end off way
better off if their parents stay toghether

02:12.563 --> 02:15.513
even if it's not a great relationship,
so... I'm in for good.

02:16.486 --> 02:17.883
Plus, Kim is amazing, so...

02:18.366 --> 02:21.157
Hopefully, one day I'll wake up
and just be... hell over hills.

02:21.525 --> 02:22.584
Yeah, that happens a lot.

02:23.965 --> 02:25.039
Hi, guys.

02:25.497 --> 02:26.902
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:27.758 --> 02:28.861
Is Izzie in the room?

02:29.301 --> 02:32.616
Turk hadn't checked, so he had
a 50/50 shot of answering correctly.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.108
Sleeeping like an angel.

02:35.642 --> 02:36.662
Really?

02:37.383 --> 02:38.892
Because she's on my back!

02:39.667 --> 02:40.861
That's unfortunate.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.684
How can you come home and
not checking on your own child?

02:45.009 --> 02:47.717
You know what? I'm so sick of
this stupid videogame, that's it.

02:48.018 --> 02:49.186
I want that out of that house.

02:49.230 --> 02:52.280
Come on, I just got this thing. I'm already
on the 5th level. Just let me finish!

02:52.324 --> 02:54.357
- Carla, let him finish!
- Oh, you can have it!

02:54.733 --> 02:56.059
Family comes first, Turk.

02:56.310 --> 03:00.327
Baby, studies have shown that using joysticks
can improve a surgeon sexterity.

03:00.470 --> 03:03.061
- You can have this one.
- I'm gonna kill you!

03:04.782 --> 03:05.945
That's my baby pager.

03:06.725 --> 03:07.637
I'm having a baby!

03:07.985 --> 03:10.195
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna be a "bluncle"!

03:10.946 --> 03:13.340
- A black uncle.
- Oh, right.

03:13.432 --> 03:15.513
You guys, I know when I first brought
this happy thought I was cheesy,

03:15.579 --> 03:18.894
but now that this actually happening, can we
do a three-person celebratory jump hug?

03:19.071 --> 03:20.078
Pleeeeeeease?

03:20.564 --> 03:21.330
For you.

03:22.133 --> 03:24.942
- Wooooooooh hooooooo!!!
- Ah ah!!

03:25.493 --> 03:26.662
You' were right, that was cheesy.

03:27.171 --> 03:28.028
Should have listened.

Finally we get to meet Sam.
I wonder what he looks like.

03:45.268 --> 03:48.279
Oh, I just wanna help you baby.
I mean what more can you ask for?

03:50.445 --> 03:52.502
Any second now...

03:52.949 --> 03:53.400
What the...

03:57.712 --> 03:59.991

04:09.184 --> 04:10.934
<i>I wondered where he was hiding...</i>

04:11.729 --> 04:15.462
Jd, I know we've had our ups and downs,

04:15.898 --> 04:17.849
but I'm really glad we're
going through this together.

04:18.517 --> 04:19.245
Me too.

04:19.583 --> 04:20.560
<i>And I really was.</i>

04:22.084 --> 04:25.734
Ok Kim, you're still a few hours away, and I
understand you'll be wanting an epidural?

04:25.832 --> 04:28.333
Yes, but I hate pain so much
I'm hoping there's

04:28.334 --> 04:30.803
a pill you can give me so that getting
the epidural itself won't hurt.

04:31.112 --> 04:33.163
- Ha ha...
- Ha ha...

04:33.164 --> 04:36.031
Why does she think I’m joking?
I hate her and her chat monkey face.

04:37.217 --> 04:39.935
Kim your quite voice is
a little louder than usual.

04:40.318 --> 04:42.713
The delivery nurses usually
get the anesthesiologist

04:42.726 --> 04:46.283
to deliver your pain medication,
but we are little under stuff, so..

04:46.284 --> 04:48.886
- Jd!
- I'll be in charge of the epidural

04:48.887 --> 04:51.104
And as soon as you are ready, I'll have
it make you so numb you're gonna feel

04:51.105 --> 04:52.549
 like you 're passing a marshmallow.

04:52.656 --> 04:56.238
- But that sounds sticky and uncomfortable.
- Passing a unicorn...

04:56.472 --> 04:58.604
That's a big horse with a horn!

04:58.958 --> 05:02.562
- Passing a rainbow!
- That's better!

05:04.020 --> 05:04.831
Ok

05:06.635 --> 05:07.662
Uhm.. Jordan.

05:08.525 --> 05:09.209
Go away.

05:10.748 --> 05:11.522
Let's go see mommy!

05:12.055 --> 05:13.880
Our daughter needs to go
the hospital.

05:14.060 --> 05:16.425
Her rash is spreadin'
and she could use a steroid shot.

05:17.056 --> 05:18.092
Why can't you just do it here?

05:18.580 --> 05:20.300
Jennifer has uropathy

05:20.637 --> 05:24.505
And over the next couple of years plenty of
doctors are gonna be poking and prodding her.

05:24.970 --> 05:28.252
I would like her to see me as her
father, not as just anther white coat

05:28.253 --> 05:30.482
that she would forever associate with pain.

05:31.233 --> 05:32.705
Totally legittimate argument.

05:33.058 --> 05:33.516
Ah.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.804
If three months olds didn't have
the memory of an earthworm...

05:36.962 --> 05:38.750
Could you please just
support us on this one?

05:39.733 --> 05:41.668
Fine. I'm right behind you.

05:50.645 --> 05:51.756
Wow that's real talent.

05:53.768 --> 05:56.952
Babe I promise you, I would be home
as soon as Kim delivers.

05:57.605 --> 06:00.151
Yet JD needs me, and I really
wanna be there for him.

06:01.188 --> 06:01.676
Ok.

06:04.222 --> 06:05.190
Hi people, listen up!

06:05.348 --> 06:08.644
I need to beat this videogame before
Kim delivers Jd's bastard child,

06:08.645 --> 06:11.115
It takes two people do it,
so I can't do it by myself,

06:11.423 --> 06:13.300
- Who's with me?
- I would Turkleton,

06:13.301 --> 06:15.823
but I only play Pacman
and that car jack game.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.272
There's nothing like scoring a caddy
and going down on street hos.

06:18.610 --> 06:20.697
- Sir what you're doing here so late?
- I live here.

06:21.253 --> 06:23.213
Enid kicked me out of
the house, six weeks ago.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.262
She wheeled in and caught me
hitting on her speech therapist.

06:26.698 --> 06:30.141
C'est la vie. Now, if you don't
mind, I've got a zac coming.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.661
Dude!

06:34.492 --> 06:36.257
We're friends at night.
I'll play.

06:37.226 --> 06:38.217
Yes.

06:39.922 --> 06:42.039
What are your thoughts on cloth diapers?

06:42.040 --> 06:44.243
'Cause if we got black ones with orange spots

06:44.244 --> 06:47.161
- our kid would look like Bam-Bam.
- JD.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.074
You've been so great.

06:50.540 --> 06:53.003
I'm feeling really connected
to you, you know?

06:53.911 --> 06:55.120
How are you feeling about us?

06:55.466 --> 06:58.552
<i>Oh no, wrong time for this
conversation, but there's no way out.</i>

06:59.164 --> 06:59.596
Vivian.

07:00.235 --> 07:01.781
<i>Oh thank you Perry much.</i>

07:01.976 --> 07:05.513
We heard that you're having a baby, we just
wanted to come by and say congratulations.

07:06.068 --> 07:08.178
- Really?
- No, I'm looking for the pediatrician.

07:08.832 --> 07:09.531
It's not here.

07:10.071 --> 07:13.969
- Sorry, baby JD.
- Her name's Jennifer Dylan,

07:14.172 --> 07:15.696
not JD.

07:15.967 --> 07:18.971
<i>I'm calling her JD forever
and he can't stop me.</i>

07:18.972 --> 07:21.114
All the best there, Kim. Please
know that the entire world

07:21.115 --> 07:23.517
is praying that the dominant
genes are yours.

07:23.945 --> 07:26.858
<i>Thank God, there's no way  Kim
remembers what we were talking about.</i>

07:27.518 --> 07:29.599
<i>Hell, I don't even remember
what we were talking about.</i>

07:29.674 --> 07:32.655
- What are we talking about?
- I was asking how you're feeling about us.

07:33.015 --> 07:33.729
<i>Damn it!</i>

07:34.216 --> 07:36.905
I've been work up the courage
to tell you that...

07:37.986 --> 07:39.841
- I'm falling...
- No! Don't say it.

07:40.697 --> 07:41.185
Why not?

07:41.673 --> 07:45.293
Look, I think you're amazing, but...
I'm just not ready to say it back yet.

07:46.464 --> 07:47.373
That's ok.

07:48.582 --> 07:50.865
I really hurt you, so it makes sense

07:50.985 --> 07:54.011
that you'd need more time to get there.

07:55.453 --> 07:56.759
<i>Bullet dodged.</i>

07:57.300 --> 07:59.868
Hey, what the hell... JD, I love you.

08:02.459 --> 08:03.308
Cool!

08:06.103 --> 08:08.602
Dr. Cox! We heard that
you were waiting for

08:08.603 --> 08:09.970
- the pediatrician.
- Oh, please.

08:10.083 --> 08:11.299
Remember our rule?

08:12.591 --> 08:15.460
We... We heard that you were
waiting for the pediatrician...

08:15.693 --> 08:19.733
Uh, he's at home so we paged him and he said that
we should give your daughter the shot ourselves.

08:20.191 --> 08:24.865
There is no way in hell that I'm letting
an incompetent intern touch my child.

08:25.230 --> 08:29.165
Oh, oh, but... But you said we are the
future of the hospital and we need to learn.

08:29.421 --> 08:32.365
You need to learn on patients
not related to me.

08:32.366 --> 08:34.054
Ones that I don't care if you kill or maim.

08:35.008 --> 08:38.337
- We are your doctors, deal with it.
- Yeah, we are you're doctors.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.217
Why don't you always talk that way?

08:42.111 --> 08:44.665
Because it hurts my throat too much.

08:47.835 --> 08:51.612
- Ok, all we have to do here is kill space goblins.
- And what's my motivation?

08:52.423 --> 08:54.608
You're motivation is
to kill space goblins.

08:54.688 --> 08:56.264
Yeah, but like killing them
because I hate them

08:56.265 --> 08:58.853
or because I don't share
their space goblin values?

08:58.889 --> 09:00.143
Whatever you want.

09:00.751 --> 09:01.862
Good shot.

09:04.205 --> 09:04.866
What are you doing?

09:05.714 --> 09:08.808
I'm taking a few moments to speak
on behalf of our fallen adversary.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.332
Are you kidding me right now?

09:11.248 --> 09:12.495
Forgive me, space goblin.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.648
If it weren't up for the Navas
Level setting and the

09:15.649 --> 09:18.704
ten cups of coffee I had earlier
today, you might have bested me

09:18.705 --> 09:20.664
this day in the marsh of Cathrick.

09:21.994 --> 09:25.718
We're not too different, you and I.
Just bide your arm-mounted cannon and

09:25.719 --> 09:28.076
your insatiable taste for human flesh...

09:28.819 --> 09:31.868
You realize that while you're talking this alien
in front is shooting you in the face, right?

09:32.364 --> 09:33.678
Well, well that was just rude.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.629
Get some!

09:37.643 --> 09:41.300
Ok. Not answering Kim's "I love you"
was akward, but at least it was over.

09:42.204 --> 09:44.184
So, do you think you can
ever be in love with me?

09:44.185 --> 09:45.536
<i>Let it go, woman!</i>

09:46.355 --> 09:48.225
Kim, let's focus on having the baby.

09:48.548 --> 09:49.299
Answer the question.

09:49.629 --> 09:50.267
<i>Lie to her.</i>

09:50.762 --> 09:51.633
And don't lie to me.

09:52.129 --> 09:54.900
Look, I think you're amazing, right?
I have... I have mentioned that.

09:55.291 --> 09:58.948
And... And even though I'm not...
you know, in love with you right now,

09:59.444 --> 10:04.355
I really hope that one day I wake
up feeling what you said you feel,

10:04.963 --> 10:07.021
even though I kinda asked you not to say it.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.535
- Do you really hope that?
- With all my heart.

10:11.038 --> 10:12.825
Because I always dreamed of finding a guy

10:12.826 --> 10:15.311
who hoped he can fall
in love with me, someday.

10:15.641 --> 10:17.879
- Really? That's kind of weird.
- No! JD?

10:17.880 --> 10:19.509
Do you actually think that's enough for me?

10:20.184 --> 10:22.287
There are a lot of guys out
there who think I'm a good catch.

10:22.288 --> 10:26.379
The words "Cute as a button" have been
thrown around in more than one occasion.

10:26.508 --> 10:30.307
- I know that Kim, you're amazing.
- Stop calling me amazing, ok?!

10:30.525 --> 10:33.326
Would you even be with me if
I wasn't dropping this kid?

10:35.062 --> 10:36.143
I don't know how to answer that.

10:38.816 --> 10:40.017
I think you just did.

10:42.931 --> 10:43.802
You know what?

10:46.400 --> 10:47.031
We're done.

10:47.617 --> 10:48.667
What... What are you talking about?

10:48.668 --> 10:50.666
- We're having a baby!
- Yeah, we are, but

10:50.899 --> 10:53.775
I deserve to be with somebody who
doesn't need to cross his fingers

10:54.120 --> 10:56.921
and hope that he falls in
love with me. Maybe, someday.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.774
Ahhh, it's over, JD.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.404
WHERE THE HELL IS THE EPIDURAAAL!?

11:07.735 --> 11:10.693
<i>It's funny how even the best
intentions can blow up in your face.</i>

11:11.166 --> 11:14.658
Don't worry. I've practiced this
on tomatoes like a hundred times.

11:15.365 --> 11:18.458
<i>Whether you meant to keep your
daughter from associating you with pain.</i>

11:19.322 --> 11:21.064
Step away from the child.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.419
Oh my... ok...

11:25.464 --> 11:28.032
<i>Or you simply intended to
get closure on a videogame.</i>

11:28.738 --> 11:31.457
This is what you call
"Being there for JD"?

11:32.823 --> 11:35.564
Oh my God, I don't think I
could be any angrier at you.

11:35.901 --> 11:38.897
Oh yeah? Well, you're about to find
out cause I'm finishing this videogame.

11:40.091 --> 11:41.105
Hihihi!

11:41.803 --> 11:45.002
<i>And though you have every intention
of making a horrible situation better.</i>

11:45.287 --> 11:47.045
Ok, looks I could rally for this baby!

11:47.217 --> 11:49.590
No way! Wait! Wait! Wait!
What about my epidural?

11:49.620 --> 11:52.098
Kim, you're fully dilated.
It's too late for the epidural.

11:52.406 --> 11:53.638
You should have told told me sooner.

11:53.765 --> 11:55.650
<i>You often find out that
you've made it worse.</i>

11:55.920 --> 11:57.790
YOUUUU!

11:57.993 --> 11:59.352
You're amazing.

12:01.823 --> 12:07.222
WAAAAAH I HATE YOU SO MUCH JD!

12:07.223 --> 12:09.661
Don’t worry all women say that stuff
during labor, she doesn’t mean it.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.718
- I DO! HE JUST BROKE UP WITH ME!
- What?

12:12.719 --> 12:15.482
Nonono, technically I didn't break up with
her, I just told her I don't love her.

12:15.602 --> 12:18.253
- Who did he say that to?
- The mother of his baby!

12:18.449 --> 12:19.643
No, he didn't.

12:19.741 --> 12:21.258
<i>Man, she looks familiar...</i>

12:21.726 --> 12:22.732
GET OUT!

12:22.733 --> 12:24.930
No, I'm not letting you go
through this alone.

12:25.140 --> 12:27.160
I have someone else I can call!

12:32.311 --> 12:34.864
Keith, I get it, I ruined
your life, stop calling.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.591
- (Kim Moaning)
- Oh, hey, Kim.

12:38.769 --> 12:41.397
Lok it, I know that I called you at home
and I threatened to kill your dog,

12:41.464 --> 12:43.785
but thanks again for coming
in there, Dr. Callahan.

12:44.227 --> 12:47.066
No problem. It's not like
I need a lot of sleep to

12:47.067 --> 12:49.439
- practice medicine on small children.
- This'll only take a second.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.481
My daughter needs a shot for a dermatitis.

12:51.609 --> 12:54.425
Oh, I'm afraid I can't do
that, I'm Dr. No-Shot.

12:55.198 --> 12:58.307
You're kidding, right? You're a pediatrician, you must...

12:58.473 --> 13:00.710
- give the occasional shot...
- Sure.

13:00.913 --> 13:03.602
My name is Dr. Occasional Shot, but it's not.

13:04.795 --> 13:07.859
Look, I have been a doctor
for these kids for years,

13:08.099 --> 13:11.500
I don't want them balling every time they see
me because they associate me with pain.

13:11.763 --> 13:14.745
- That's insane.
- Yeah.

13:14.992 --> 13:17.125
And why aren't you
giving your daughter the shot?

13:17.328 --> 13:20.380
I don't want her to forever
associate me with...

13:21.078 --> 13:21.529
<i>pain.</i>

13:22.126 --> 13:23.538
What? I didn't-I didn't catch that.

13:23.755 --> 13:24.086
<i>Pain.</i>

13:24.236 --> 13:25.993
Is it your inside voice?
You can-you can pick it up.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.878
Mydaughtertoforeverassociatemewithpain.

13:28.201 --> 13:28.922
Ironic...

13:30.968 --> 13:32.515
We'll just have one of the
nurses to give it to her.

13:34.084 --> 13:36.773
I don't want any nurse in this
town to touch my daughter.

13:38.065 --> 13:40.318
I can't believe you're still
playing this stupid game.

13:40.490 --> 13:42.638
- Hit him with the firesaber.
- Hit him with a lamp.

13:42.848 --> 13:44.553
There's no lamp in this game, sir.

13:44.725 --> 13:46.310
I was talking to your wife.

13:47.008 --> 13:48.547
Hit Turkelton with this lamp.

13:49.764 --> 13:50.785
Oh, Carla, good.

13:51.258 --> 13:54.120
Listen, I need you to give my kid
a shot, it'll only take a second.

13:54.232 --> 13:56.650
No, I can't do it. I'm literally
shaking with rage.

13:56.966 --> 13:57.431
See?

13:58.002 --> 14:04.528
I would give her a shot, Perry, but this...
is scotch, and I'm all Hasselhoffed out.

14:05.617 --> 14:06.165
Allright.

14:07.479 --> 14:10.288
- Janitor, you're getting pummled.
- That sounded like criticism.

14:10.506 --> 14:13.697
- I don't respond well to criticism.
- Whatever, you still suck.

14:15.334 --> 14:17.106
- I'm out.
- No, dude, come on.

14:17.969 --> 14:21.168
Baby why'd you have to go and say that?
I can't finish this game by myself.

14:23.173 --> 14:24.833
Find all might leave, jump on that Warthog.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.580
You drive, I'll mend the machine-gun
and kill all the Jackals.

14:29.879 --> 14:31.577
You've never been more sexy to me!

14:37.637 --> 14:40.220
Oh, that's disgusting!

14:40.385 --> 14:41.294
Uh. Hey, Keith.

14:42.225 --> 14:43.621
- Burn in hell.
- Hm.

14:45.581 --> 14:47.458
I'm so sorry about you and Kim.

14:47.931 --> 14:50.492
- Is there anything I can do?
- Just take care of her.

14:50.748 --> 14:51.514
Ok.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.027
God, you're having a baby!

14:55.553 --> 14:59.322
- Wanna do a celebratory jump?
- Nah, Turk, Carla and I tried one earlier,

14:59.518 --> 15:02.079
- turned out to be lame.
- Oh, please...

15:02.349 --> 15:04.587
You privately loved it, though
still don't want to admit it.

15:04.984 --> 15:06.141
<i>God, she knows me!</i>

15:07.095 --> 15:09.370
Hey, you! D'Barbie go that way?

15:09.843 --> 15:10.511
Thanks.

15:11.194 --> 15:12.681
- GET OUT!
- Oh.

15:12.840 --> 15:16.136
Dear God. It is like Baghdad in there...

15:16.505 --> 15:19.794
Look, Noobie, I'm on the
virge of losing of my mind,

15:19.795 --> 15:23.699
Do you have the time to give my daughter
a shot, now that you've ruined your life?

15:24.209 --> 15:26.500
- Will you talk me through when I'm going to?
- Absolutely not.

15:26.590 --> 15:29.286
- Then find someone else to help you.
- Oh, damn, fine. Ok.

15:29.354 --> 15:33.807
Fine. But if you use the words "emotional
rollercoaster" I am on your teeth.

15:33.874 --> 15:36.300
Deal. I just feel like I'm
on this like emotional...

15:37.494 --> 15:39.041
- ride of some sort...
- Oh...

15:39.042 --> 15:40.228
Kinda like a...

15:41.279 --> 15:44.372
Baby, you are awesome!
Did you play this before?

15:47.114 --> 15:47.684
Listen,

15:48.332 --> 15:52.305
I discovered the game when Izzy had colic and
I was up all night, and I became addicted.

15:52.350 --> 15:55.121
That's actually the main reason why
I wanted it out of the apartment.

15:55.285 --> 15:59.543
Oh... I thought you were mad because
I'd rather play the game than play with Izzy.

15:59.889 --> 16:04.552
Which I guess it's sometimes true, baby...
don't get it twisted that girl is my world,

16:05.680 --> 16:08.841
but every now and then I gotta do my own
thing. You've heard of anger-pains?

16:09.299 --> 16:12.521
I get sports-pains. And "watch
Judge Dredd with JD"-pains

16:12.522 --> 16:14.383
Turk, you think you're
the only one who gets pains?

16:14.639 --> 16:18.552
I get "Put on my tight jeans and walk down
the street to see if anybody horns"-pains.

16:18.778 --> 16:22.052
They do, actually. I mean, how do you think I
became addicted to this game?

16:22.457 --> 16:24.492
Every parent needs to
take some time off.

16:24.912 --> 16:26.887
You're damn right, they do.

16:27.746 --> 16:30.131
Hell, my son Harrison is a grown man,

16:30.132 --> 16:33.481
and I still get urge to
slip away during his visits.

16:34.355 --> 16:37.235
Of course, it may have more to do with
this new boyfriend he has.

16:37.648 --> 16:41.095
I swear. You could line up
a hundred gay men,

16:41.260 --> 16:46.704
and Harrison would pick out the attention
starved by poor ex-con everytime.

16:49.078 --> 16:49.626
Oh!

16:50.797 --> 16:53.725
Harrison! Your ears must
have been burning!

16:54.559 --> 16:55.558
And now, what do we do?

16:56.211 --> 16:58.554
We kill one more alien boss,
and then we've finished.

16:59.172 --> 17:00.807
I like your style.

17:02.257 --> 17:05.223
Of course you had to break up with him.

17:05.733 --> 17:09.337
No one you love should ever sell
your car without asking

17:09.338 --> 17:11.380
and then blow all the money on meth.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.390
The kid's not even born yet, and
I'm already screwing up his life.

17:17.141 --> 17:19.926
I just wanted him to be really happy,
and normal, you know?

17:19.928 --> 17:22.359
Ok, first one, noobie,
we're talking about your kid.

17:22.361 --> 17:24.755
So the whole normal part
was never gonna happen.

17:24.756 --> 17:27.696
- And... you didn't mess up his life.
- Ah, come on, statistics show

17:27.698 --> 17:30.371
- that kids whose parents stay together...
- "Statistics show" who... who cares,

17:30.372 --> 17:31.926
what statistic's showing?

17:32.188 --> 17:34.475
Look at medicine. 80% of people,

17:34.476 --> 17:38.359
with pancreatic cancer, die within
5 years, 95% of appendectomies,

17:38.360 --> 17:40.283
occur with zero complications. But...

17:40.553 --> 17:43.227
we both know pancreatic
cancer patient that lived,

17:43.228 --> 17:46.764
and appendix patients
that unfortunately... passed.

17:47.380 --> 17:49.558
Statistics mean nothing to the individual.

17:50.001 --> 17:52.757
You're either gonna be a good
parent to that kid, or you're not.

17:52.758 --> 17:55.619
I mean, hell, your parents were divorcing,
and somehow you managed to become

17:55.620 --> 17:58.795
a relatively successful doctor,
and I'm sure there's...

17:59.568 --> 18:03.743
someone... somewhere... who would be
proud to call you their son.

18:04.990 --> 18:08.339
- Would you be proud to call me your son?
- This conversation's over.

18:10.096 --> 18:12.717
- Carla, are you done yet?
- Not yet.

18:13.708 --> 18:17.553
<i>As I looked around the room, I thought
about the things parents do for their kids.</i>

18:18.108 --> 18:21.690
<i>Like going to extraordinary lenghts,
to ensure their child never fears them.</i>

18:22.186 --> 18:24.078
Ok, let's keep looking.

18:25.069 --> 18:26.668
<i>Helping them mend their broken heart.</i>

18:27.674 --> 18:31.887
Oh, why can't you still be with Gary?
I always liked him.

18:33.494 --> 18:35.897
What do you mean
"He stole your fillings"?

18:36.370 --> 18:39.787
<i>Or staying up late, to make sure there's
one less distraction around.</i>

18:40.523 --> 18:42.791
Game, and that's game,
and that's how we do!

18:43.113 --> 18:45.952
And that's how... we do!

18:45.953 --> 18:46.718
That's right.

18:48.272 --> 18:50.585
<i>And I realized parenting is
about sacrifice.</i>

18:51.028 --> 18:53.521
<i>And I had to go in there
and be there for my child.</i>

18:53.897 --> 18:56.128
<i>Even if that meant taking
some well-deserved abuse.</i>

18:57.870 --> 18:59.972
GET OUTTA HERE, YOU JERK!

19:00.138 --> 19:00.979
No.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.147
Ok, I need you to stop pushing for a minute.

19:06.197 --> 19:08.150
- You're a piece of crap.
- You're doing great.

19:08.151 --> 19:11.041
- I hate your hair.
- Impossible, nobody does.

19:12.512 --> 19:13.977
Almost there...

19:14.389 --> 19:17.881
Are you two ready to be parents?

19:18.437 --> 19:20.186
<i>And right then I couldn't
help but wondering.</i>

19:26.839 --> 19:27.710
<i>Are you ever?</i>

19:30.766 --> 19:33.259
Anyway, I hope you... I hope you
want two words about us.

19:35.849 --> 19:37.952
We'll be home real soon. Bye.

19:40.611 --> 19:42.451
I love watching her sleep.

19:44.020 --> 19:46.138
I can't believe we finished that game!

19:46.139 --> 19:47.888
Oh, baby.

19:48.165 --> 19:49.847
I finished it a bunch of times.

19:52.002 --> 19:53.166
- Word?
- Hmm, hm.

19:57.491 --> 19:58.933
He's so beautiful.

20:00.172 --> 20:02.680
I'm really glad you came back in.

20:03.574 --> 20:04.400
Me too.

20:05.624 --> 20:07.141
It's weird, you know.

20:08.117 --> 20:11.579
This is the end of our relationship,
but it's sorta just the beginning.

20:15.025 --> 20:16.024
Can I hold him?

20:16.910 --> 20:18.502
Of course.

20:19.073 --> 20:20.222
Here's your daddy.

20:21.236 --> 20:22.460
Hiii.

20:24.412 --> 20:26.102
Hi, handsome.

20:26.823 --> 20:29.008
Welcome to the world, Sammy.
