01:20.121 --> 01:21.998
We're gonna need more paint. [chuckles]

Whatever gets those creative juices

it's yours.

01:25.835 --> 01:26.920
Ready to see the vision?

01:27.504 --> 01:30.423
Girl, I wore my lucky mala beads
for the occasion.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.758
Show me, show me.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.802
-This.
-OK.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.679
-Oh! Mm.
-And this.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.140
But this.

[exhales] Brown love is love
is love, baby.

01:45.647 --> 01:46.481
It's everything.

01:47.232 --> 01:51.653
It is the perfect centerpiece
for my art market.

01:51.736 --> 01:52.821
Oh, Ana.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.280
I want you to imagine this, OK?

01:54.364 --> 01:55.698
Imagine an artist's hub

01:55.782 --> 01:57.826
where people from all walks of life

01:57.909 --> 02:00.370
are coming together
to share in our passions.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.497
Imagine that your mural

02:02.747 --> 02:04.249
is gonna be the centerpiece

02:04.332 --> 02:06.334
and brings artists here from...

02:07.252 --> 02:08.503
East LA,

02:08.837 --> 02:09.879
WeHo,

02:09.963 --> 02:11.339
hell, even Santa Monica.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.216
-[chuckles]
-And where the artists go,

02:13.591 --> 02:14.551
the money goes.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.344
[in Spanish] Yes, you can,

02:16.427 --> 02:17.971
baby girl. Thank you.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.348
[in Spanish] Excuse me.
Excuse me, move aside.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.184
Jesus, Ofelia! I'm like standing here!

02:23.351 --> 02:25.478
Oh, hey, darling. I want you to meet Ana.

02:25.770 --> 02:28.064
She is this top notch artist.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.024
Oh, and fellow Ecuadorian compatriot.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.526
-I'm from Zacatecas.
-I'm Chicana.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.194
Yeah, you know what I mean, babe.

02:33.444 --> 02:36.656
So, Ofelia, she actually runs
the liquor store

02:36.739 --> 02:38.158
in the building that I just bought,

02:38.241 --> 02:39.659
and she's been here for ages.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.202
[in Spanish] So pleased to meet you!

02:42.162 --> 02:45.999
Um... I'm the artist that's going
to paint on this wall here.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.126
-That's fine.
-Thank you for the opportunity.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.752
-Ana is going
-[Ana, scoffs]

02:49.836 --> 02:51.963
to completely beautify  the location, OK?

02:52.046 --> 02:54.632
With her incredible artistic works.

02:54.716 --> 02:58.219
And it's gonna be mucho dinero,
Ofelia, OK?

02:58.303 --> 03:01.264
Lots and lots of business coming your way.

03:01.639 --> 03:02.473
Is that true?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.518
Well, yes.

03:05.602 --> 03:09.564
Look, the mural I'm painting
will be incredible!

03:09.647 --> 03:11.357
A gorgeous mural.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.984
Full of beautiful brown people.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.069
For the community.
You're going to love it!

03:15.320 --> 03:16.487
Very good.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.824
Bueno! Bueno! OK, I gotta go.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.075
So amazing,

03:21.159 --> 03:22.869
and uh... I love you.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.421
But what if he files
an unlawful detainer in the future?

03:33.504 --> 03:36.716
[chuckles] OK, Erik, stop mansplaining
for just one second

03:36.841 --> 03:38.509
so that Ms. Cruz here can explain.

03:39.135 --> 03:42.722
Reads a few books. Now he thinks
he's Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [chuckles]

03:43.223 --> 03:45.266
RBG! She's my jam.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.603
I read all about her in my Women's Studies
class at Boise State.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.230
That's where I got my degree...

03:51.189 --> 03:52.315
in business, so...

03:52.857 --> 03:54.359
Is that-- You're done?

03:54.442 --> 03:55.401
-I'm done.
-OK

03:55.485 --> 03:56.486
[phone ringing in distance]

03:56.611 --> 03:59.572
Well, Erik is asking
all the right questions.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.158
Detainer.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.952
[in Spanish] What's a detainer?

04:04.118 --> 04:06.496
It sounds pretty. Detainer.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.790
Does Pop know how to read English?

04:08.915 --> 04:09.832
Not that kinda English.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.335
California is a tenant state,

04:12.543 --> 04:14.963
so he can give you an eviction notice,

04:15.046 --> 04:17.590
but as long as you're complying
with his demands

04:17.674 --> 04:19.676
within the allotted time,
then you're good.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.136
Landlords like to pull
this scare tactic often.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.306
Now in order to prevent
a future detainer

04:25.390 --> 04:27.684
or a forced eviction via court,

04:28.226 --> 04:30.186
just pay your rent on time.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.646
That's it.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.398
That's it?

04:33.564 --> 04:34.899
-Mm-hm.
-Well, that's great!

04:34.983 --> 04:36.526
Thank you so much, Miss Cruz.

04:36.818 --> 04:37.652
God bless you.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.655
Look, I don't know how to thank you, mija,

04:40.738 --> 04:41.656
-but...
-Oh, Jesus, Pop.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.616
I hope you like carnitas.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.659
Seriously?

04:44.742 --> 04:45.785
No, I...

04:45.868 --> 04:48.746
Getting paid in carnitas is OK by me!

04:48.830 --> 04:49.956
[in Spanish] Thank you, sir.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.332
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

04:51.582 --> 04:52.417
Thank you.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.254
I'm ready to go and I'll come back
for hot dogs later. OK?

04:57.046 --> 04:57.922
Thank you very much.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.799
You know, I'm not even hungry,
but that looks good.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.050
-Thanks, Coconut! [scoffs]
-Come on.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.218
Let's see, güero...

05:03.136 --> 05:06.306
Now what's wrong with thanking someone
with a burrito?

05:06.973 --> 05:08.683
Especially if it's a delicious burrito.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.769
Well, for starters,
the national currency is dollars, Pop.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.646
You can't cut a check with burritos.

05:13.896 --> 05:14.856
Hell yeah you can!

05:15.815 --> 05:16.691
Give me a burrito,

05:16.858 --> 05:18.860
I'll work like
a motherfucking donkey all day.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.862
Brilliant. Then why don't we just start

05:20.945 --> 05:23.323
paying you and your big donkey butt
in burritos then, huh?

05:23.406 --> 05:24.782
Hey, rent problem solved.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.326
Look. Look, cabrón...

05:27.160 --> 05:28.036
On the ranch,

05:28.870 --> 05:30.872
you can't take milk

05:31.122 --> 05:32.915
if you don't give the cow a churro.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.004
And if you give it a shot of tequila,

05:38.171 --> 05:39.547
you have enough menudo for everyone.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.178
Basically,

05:45.803 --> 05:47.722
you don't show up
to your hipster friend's dinner party

05:47.805 --> 05:49.057
without a bottle of wine, right?

05:49.265 --> 05:50.224
It's cultural,

05:50.308 --> 05:51.267
you whole wheat cracker.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.435
You clearly don't get it.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.354
Look... Whatever. The point is,

05:54.437 --> 05:55.897
we're not going to save the shop
with a burrito.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.690
We're gonna save it with some changes.

05:57.857 --> 05:58.816
And now that I'm here,

05:59.067 --> 06:02.070
I don't ever want us to be
in that situation ever again. OK?

06:02.487 --> 06:03.321
So, for starters,

06:03.738 --> 06:04.697
no more cash only.

06:04.906 --> 06:05.865
Credit cards, baby.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.784
I'm talkin' about chalkboard menus,

06:07.909 --> 06:09.577
artisanal everything.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.621
You wanna know
what the most important words

06:11.704 --> 06:13.247
we're gonna live by from now on?

06:13.956 --> 06:15.500
Extra charges.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.086
[in Spanish] In the name
of all that is holy!

06:18.169 --> 06:20.755
Real Mexicans don't charge $1.99

06:20.838 --> 06:22.465
for fucking chips

06:22.548 --> 06:23.466
and salsa, cabrón!

06:23.674 --> 06:25.885
What's next, you greedy jerks?

06:25.968 --> 06:28.721
Fifty cents for salt and pepper?

06:28.805 --> 06:29.847
Two dollars for a hug?

06:29.931 --> 06:31.516
You're all assholes! Fuck off!

06:31.599 --> 06:33.726
[in Spanish] Javier, my hugs are free.

06:34.060 --> 06:34.894
Come here.

06:35.269 --> 06:37.480
-Come here.
-Get off me, idiot!

06:37.563 --> 06:39.774
-It's just a hug.
-Screw your mother, jerk!

06:40.858 --> 06:41.818
How do you know my mother?

06:45.738 --> 06:46.823
Give me his food.

06:47.615 --> 06:48.449
And a coffee.

06:50.785 --> 06:51.619
Nice work.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.287
Real good.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.997
I've got more ideas.

06:55.832 --> 06:56.666
I'm sure.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.835
[rap music playing]

07:15.476 --> 07:17.478
[music continues on Ana's head phones]

07:23.484 --> 07:24.652
[in Spanish] Damn nosy ladies.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.781
[woman, in Spanish] You look great.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.534
[man] Brand new whip!

07:31.659 --> 07:33.661
[them song playing]

07:47.341 --> 07:48.509
[in Spanish] What's up, fools?

07:49.051 --> 07:49.886
[in English] I'm Ana.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.179
I live off of Soto.

07:51.262 --> 07:55.016
My grandpops, he owns the taco shop
on South Reyes. You know Mama Fina's?

07:55.558 --> 07:57.685
Yeah. You're Erik's baby sis?

07:57.977 --> 08:00.146
Uh... cousin. I'm his cousin.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.774
Anyhow, so I'mma be here
for like a week or so

08:03.858 --> 08:07.236
just putting up
the most beautiful mural of my life.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.738
It's gonna be about love,

08:08.821 --> 08:09.989
community, inclusion,

08:10.072 --> 08:11.073
you know, dope stuff.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.537
So since we're gonna be neighbors,
I figured I'd do the neighborly thing

08:16.621 --> 08:18.498
and brings some offerings
to the cholo altar.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.835
[giggles] Ooh! Takis.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.171
What kind of love?

08:26.714 --> 08:27.548
Brown love.

08:27.965 --> 08:28.883
For us, by us.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.802
You talkin' that Bonnie &amp; Clyde
type of love?

08:32.470 --> 08:33.471
Pete and Ari?

08:33.554 --> 08:34.722
Brangelina?

08:34.931 --> 08:38.851
Yeah, but browner and like, less doomed.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.770

-So...

08:41.145 --> 08:41.979

-Hey, compa!

09:31.821 --> 09:33.406
OK, babe. No peeking!

09:33.489 --> 09:34.323
No, no, no. No peeking!

09:34.615 --> 09:35.449

on these streets,

Ticket, please.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.924
-What?!
-[chuckes]

09:52.133 --> 09:53.259
You're lucky you're the cutest

09:53.342 --> 09:55.303
'cause this is... cheesy.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.555
-Like what's going on? [scoffs]
-OK, turn around.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.226
-Wha--What is this?
-Oh, it's from last night.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.520
[laughs]

10:05.479 --> 10:08.649
-All right, ladies and, well, lady,
-Mm-hm.

10:08.941 --> 10:09.817
right this way.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.902
-[Ana] Keep your eyes closed.
-[Yessika] Don't let me fall.

10:11.986 --> 10:12.903
You're fine.

10:13.571 --> 10:14.655
OK.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.491
-Right...

10:18.117 --> 10:18.951
OK.

Wow.

Just wow.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.858
I can't believe the liquor store folks

10:50.941 --> 10:52.652
paid you to do this here

10:52.735 --> 10:54.278
in our community!

10:54.945 --> 10:56.530

-[Connie] Mmm.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.523
This vanilla extract fucker
didn't think an immigrant woman

19:51.607 --> 19:52.941
had a right to her own walls.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.151
Bro!

19:54.651 --> 19:56.820
He would've asked the white tenants'
permission for sure.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.155
Obviously.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.198
If he would've asked,

19:59.281 --> 20:01.366
Ofelia would've shut it down real quick.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.994
Mama, you killed it! Mm!

20:04.077 --> 20:05.329
-[smooches]
-I'm so proud of you.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.289
-Mm-hm.
-Those luchadores are

20:07.372 --> 20:12.336
iconic machismo murdering homos
that arouse and--

20:12.419 --> 20:16.590
If they strip away
a brown woman's livelihood, bro,

20:16.757 --> 20:19.801
she can't have her key demographic
running into the 7-Eleven.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.262
What's she gonna do
without  her drunks and teenagers, huh?

20:22.679 --> 20:24.223
Good art's divisive, cuz.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.475
Just follow your bliss
and screw the haters.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.352
Mm! That's a great idea!

20:29.269 --> 20:31.271
You know what, you should screw yourself

20:31.813 --> 20:33.398
and back up my book program, stupid.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.317
-[laughs]
-Anyway,

20:35.400 --> 20:36.276
the point is,

20:36.860 --> 20:38.737
a landlord doesn't have
to ask for permission

20:38.820 --> 20:40.072
to paint on his own building.

20:40.155 --> 20:40.989
So?

20:41.156 --> 20:42.366
It's about respect

20:42.616 --> 20:45.535
for those who've been holding it down
in our community for years.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.412
Who the fuck asked you, Coconut?

20:47.496 --> 20:50.666
I--I dunno. Ana's Idaho potato cousin
kinda has a point.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.042
-[all] He does?
-[Chris] I do?

20:52.125 --> 20:54.419
Did Yessika just agree with me?

20:54.628 --> 20:56.463
You both have a point.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.174
Yes, it was commissioned by... uh...

21:00.008 --> 21:01.593
a fucking colonizer,

21:01.677 --> 21:06.098
but I'm all for fighting comadre
homophobia with queer love bombs.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.225
I dunno.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.394
It's Ana's riddle to solve.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.437
She'll figure out how to make it right.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.481
How the hell do I do that?

21:14.815 --> 21:15.649
Paint over it!

21:15.774 --> 21:17.192
Be a real revolutionary!

21:17.276 --> 21:20.070
[unintelligible chiding, complaining]

21:20.237 --> 21:22.447
I know. You could do
like a tequila tasting

21:22.572 --> 21:23.865
and have like a queer mariachi.

21:24.116 --> 21:24.950
A-queer-achi.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.118
[laughs]

21:26.952 --> 21:29.788
A-queer-achi, bien, mira.
[hums Mexican hat dance tune]

21:29.997 --> 21:31.373
Should we hire the Queer Eye boys also?

21:31.456 --> 21:32.457
Ofelia would love that.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.210
You know what, just do a fucking GoFundMe

21:35.294 --> 21:36.461
or a Kickstarter or some shit.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.171
Or...

21:38.380 --> 21:40.382
[samba music playing]

21:52.269 --> 21:54.271
Ana, this cash mob is amazing!

21:55.480 --> 21:58.608
You thieves! Get out of here, thieves!

21:58.692 --> 21:59.901
-OK. I'm out.
-Get out of here.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.112
Oh, my God, look.

22:02.237 --> 22:04.239
Tamarindo with chile.
You know how hard it is to find these?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.824
Look! Twenty-five cent Takis!

22:05.907 --> 22:07.409
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

22:07.534 --> 22:08.952
Oh, thank you, señora. Thank you so much.

22:09.036 --> 22:09.953
You're an angel, thank you.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.663
Oh, my God, it's a piñata!

22:11.747 --> 22:13.582
-Can you believe it?!
-[chuckles]

22:13.957 --> 22:15.792
-He can stay.
-Those look spicy.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.796
-[yells] You thieves! Get out!
-[Ana] Stop! Stop!

22:19.880 --> 22:21.882
Stop! They're paying customers! Stop!

22:22.507 --> 22:23.550
Now what did you do?

22:23.633 --> 22:25.093
No, no, no, no. I'm helping.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.428
This is a cash mob.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.556
They're gonna clear out
your entire inventory. It's genius!

22:29.639 --> 22:32.476
A damn mob here to steal my inventory?

22:32.642 --> 22:34.394
I knew it!

22:34.478 --> 22:35.312
What is this shit, Ana?

22:36.229 --> 22:37.439
OK, guys,

22:37.522 --> 22:39.107
it's OK. It's a cash mob.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.359
I invited these people here.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.110
Let me get this straight,

22:42.444 --> 22:43.987
you invited a bunch of strangers here

22:44.071 --> 22:45.489
to ransack tía Ofelia's store?

22:46.490 --> 22:47.532
I don't feel safe.

22:48.116 --> 22:49.034
Me neither, fool.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.787
Mobster white people are never safe.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.705
Nazis, conquistadores,

22:53.789 --> 22:54.831
flash dancers.

22:55.123 --> 22:55.957
Preach.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.001
[indistinct chatters]

22:58.251 --> 22:59.211
Twenty-five cent Takis?

22:59.294 --> 23:00.253
Nah, bitch.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.590
They got the big packs?

23:03.924 --> 23:04.841
In the back. Come on.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.843
OK, look, you got this all wrong.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.929
Cash mobs save small businesses.

23:09.638 --> 23:10.472
Get out of here!

23:10.555 --> 23:11.973
Leave-- Oh!

23:12.516 --> 23:14.768
Look, I told my followers,

23:14.851 --> 23:16.228
OK, that there was a señora

23:16.311 --> 23:18.688
who was losing customers
because she had commissioned

23:18.772 --> 23:20.107
a queer-friendly mural,

23:20.190 --> 23:21.858
and they came in droves to support.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.820
Look, they're gonna buy everything!
You're gonna be set for the month!

23:25.612 --> 23:26.446
You're welcome.

23:26.530 --> 23:30.867
Uh-huh. And what will my regulars buy
the rest of the month?

23:31.493 --> 23:33.036
Huh? Farts and kisses?

23:33.120 --> 23:34.746
-I don't need activists,
-Ouch!

23:34.830 --> 23:37.165
and I don't need anything from you.

23:37.290 --> 23:40.502
What I need are my regulars
who come everyday.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.546
The drunks. The ones that pay my rent.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.423
If you just give me a chance, señora!

23:44.673 --> 23:46.383
I can fix this! I can help!

23:46.591 --> 23:48.468
Oh, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí.

23:48.552 --> 23:49.386
Help.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.513
And what about me?
Do I have a say in this?

23:51.847 --> 23:53.473
Because Tim has his mural

23:53.557 --> 23:55.225
and you have your cash mob,

23:55.308 --> 23:58.186
but neither one of you asked
if I wanted any of this.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.105
[car passing by]

24:00.480 --> 24:01.857
[in Spanish] I just wanted to help.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.900
Well you didn't help me. You screwed me.

24:04.359 --> 24:05.193
Fine.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.248
[crunching]

24:19.124 --> 24:20.000
[in Spanish] And you?

24:20.292 --> 24:22.544
Why the long face?

24:22.627 --> 24:23.795
Nothing.

24:24.713 --> 24:25.547
I'm fine.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.967
Why are you eating that block of cheese
as if you're a mouse?

24:29.050 --> 24:30.051
Pop.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.721
What's up, sweetie?

24:32.804 --> 24:33.722
[sighs]

24:35.849 --> 24:38.393
Change is something very hard to do.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.396
Old folks like me don't like it.

24:43.064 --> 24:43.982
But Ofelia

24:44.858 --> 24:46.193
will come around.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.786
Maybe that mural will help her,
maybe it won't.

24:57.078 --> 25:00.040
Maybe charging for chips will help,
maybe it won't.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.917
But we need to try, mija.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.921
What doesn't feel good is being treated

25:06.004 --> 25:08.215
like you can't handle your own business.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.967
As if you're some idiot

25:11.092 --> 25:13.011
who can't make her own decisions.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.847
That's a matter of respect.

25:17.265 --> 25:20.185
You have to give her the respect
that gringo will not.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.103
All I wanted was...

25:23.438 --> 25:26.274
to do what I loved
without having to worry about money.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.360
[sighs]

25:29.069 --> 25:30.612
Me too, mija.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.280
[gentle guitar music playing]

25:32.739 --> 25:33.573
Me too.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.203
Welcome to Mama F--

25:38.286 --> 25:39.120
OK.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.540
You're offering my kid
free food and books?

25:41.748 --> 25:43.458
Talking about you got some more
in the back or some shit?

25:43.542 --> 25:44.543
Please hold.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.794
[shouts] Erik!

25:45.919 --> 25:46.753
[Erik] Hey.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.172
-Hurry up.
-Huh?

25:51.007 --> 25:52.676
Hey, what's up, Chato?
What's goin' on, bro?

25:52.759 --> 25:53.843
[groans]

25:55.178 --> 25:57.889
Oh, hey, no, no, no, no!
Hey, not like that at all, bro!

25:57.973 --> 25:59.266
[stammers] Listen, listen, I'm--

25:59.349 --> 26:00.642
We, we

26:00.725 --> 26:02.602

26:02.686 --> 26:04.354
for kids, bro. Remember BOOK IT?

26:04.437 --> 26:05.897
Where you get free pizza for reading?

26:06.439 --> 26:08.608
This is just like that, dog,
except with tacos.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.903
That's true, Chato? You read a book?

26:12.195 --> 26:13.071
Three books.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.532
He gets a free taco for every book?

26:15.615 --> 26:17.534
-Well, that's pushing it, we feel like--
-Yes,

26:17.617 --> 26:20.829
yeah, yeah! Yeah, bro. Yeah.
He gets a taco-- three.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.998
So we'll take three free tacos,

26:25.750 --> 26:28.086
three tortas to go for the fam.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.006
Hey, go get another book, mijo.

26:35.135 --> 26:36.303
I'll be back with his sister.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.305
Hey, bring the whole family, bro.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.515
OK. Thank you.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.695
How do I make this right?

26:54.446 --> 26:57.198
I'll do anything,
but I cannot censor my art.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.243
That would mean pretending there's
something wrong with me when there's not.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.286
I can't do that.

27:02.537 --> 27:03.705
[in Spanish] Look, young lady.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.667
Do you honestly think Tim wants me here?

27:08.460 --> 27:11.546
That he'll want me to be here
in five years?

27:12.964 --> 27:14.257
One day, my dear,

27:14.924 --> 27:17.260
that mural is going to erase me.

27:18.595 --> 27:19.429
But you know what?

27:20.221 --> 27:22.015
I'm not going to let that happen.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.683
I'm sorry. I'm just...

I'm just trying to make this right
for the both of us.

27:27.854 --> 27:28.688
I know.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.733
Get out of here, you fucking dirty dyke!

27:32.359 --> 27:34.861
Nobody wants you
or your disgusting mural here!

Hey, do you pray to the Virgin Mary
with that mouth?

27:41.117 --> 27:42.661
-But it's--
-But nothing!

27:42.744 --> 27:45.080
I don't need you as a customer. Get out!

27:45.163 --> 27:46.665
Fine, go to hell!

27:46.748 --> 27:48.708
After you, asshole!

27:50.752 --> 27:51.586
Thank you.

27:55.423 --> 27:56.257
You see?

27:57.592 --> 27:59.636
You only bring me problems.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.721
["Vamonos" by Chavela Vargas playing]
