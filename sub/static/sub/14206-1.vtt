WEBVTT

00:00.529 --> 00:05.521
Coupling - 1x01 - Flushed

00:09.650 --> 00:12.595
You won't admit you love me,

00:12.979 --> 00:18.774
and so how am I ever to know.

00:19.075 --> 00:25.808
You always tell me,
perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

00:26.301 --> 00:31.865
Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps

00:35.904 --> 00:37.236
So you're really gonna do it.

00:37.718 --> 00:38.320
Oh, yeah.

00:38.774 --> 00:39.422
This time.

00:43.683 --> 00:45.001
Just say what he wanted.

00:45.302 --> 00:46.041
Not a word.

00:48.070 --> 00:49.232
Maybe he's gonna propose.

00:51.427 --> 00:53.176
You think she knows
you're gonna dump her?

00:53.528 --> 00:54.026
Oh, She ought to.

00:54.036 --> 00:56.777
By now, I've dumped her
the last 4 times I've seen her.

00:57.315 --> 00:58.363
So what goes wrong?

00:59.850 --> 01:00.700
We have sex.

01:02.278 --> 01:03.866
- You have sex.
- She makes me.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.636
How?

01:06.652 --> 01:07.707
She suggests it.

01:09.826 --> 01:11.279
- She suggests it?
- Exactly!

01:13.868 --> 01:14.608
Evil!

01:18.164 --> 01:20.253
You said you had
a fantastic time last week end?

01:20.356 --> 01:20.964
Yeah.

01:21.033 --> 01:22.890
Maybe you're thinking, you know ...

01:23.981 --> 01:25.681
One swallow does not make a summer.

01:28.439 --> 01:29.486
So last time I dumped her,

01:29.830 --> 01:34.164
we had like amazing, fantastic,
borderline illegal sex.

01:34.365 --> 01:35.445
Then, she thinks we are back on.

01:36.271 --> 01:37.836
- Oh, that's ridiculous.
- I know.

01:38.143 --> 01:40.313
One swallow does not make her my girlfriend.

01:42.514 --> 01:44.024
Maybe you should marry him.

01:44.968 --> 01:46.800
It's not like that.
It's very casual.

01:46.801 --> 01:49.878
It's really just sex
with a fringe of conversation.

01:50.392 --> 01:52.000
What if he's
your last ever man?

01:52.800 --> 01:54.732
What if you've
used up your goes?

01:55.200 --> 01:55.906
Remember,

01:56.840 --> 02:00.000
every morning, you face has
slipped a little bit more.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.240
Since 30, I've had to put
a daily limit on facial expressions.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.039
I only ever smile at single men,

02:10.479 --> 02:12.640
so I can justify the loss of elasticity.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.640
Is this how your mind
works all the time?

02:16.540 --> 02:17.360
The only reason I work is,

02:17.520 --> 02:19.480
so I stop worrying about my hair.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.560
And this from my beautician.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.760
Which reminds me,
Facial, Wednesday Evening.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.643
Yeah, well, just don't count
every time you find a wrinkle.

02:28.019 --> 02:29.209
Do I do that out loud?

02:30.040 --> 02:32.080
You've got
a running total in my file.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.208
Sally, does it ever occur to you that,

02:35.443 --> 02:38.320
age brings wisdom
and greater confidence?

02:39.100 --> 02:42.640
Susan, age brings you more to shave.

02:45.980 --> 02:49.240
So you dumped her, and then,
she does the suggesting thing?

02:49.341 --> 02:49.743
Yeah

02:50.880 --> 02:54.480
You know, I'll be just about to leave;
I'll be thinking that I'm finally out.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.680
She just leans over,
looks me in the eyes and goes:

02:59.083 --> 03:00.520
"I'm wearing stockings."

03:01.571 --> 03:02.254
No.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.569
And she's never worn them before.

03:03.860 --> 03:05.708
Not once in the entire relationship.

03:05.943 --> 03:06.955
I begged.

03:08.420 --> 03:11.235
Yeah, but Steve, you are entitled
to her stockings.

03:12.990 --> 03:13.520
Am I?

03:13.700 --> 03:15.221
Yes. You are still in the Zone.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.600
- The what?
- The Boyfriend Zone.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.760
This is the tailing-off period.

03:20.260 --> 03:22.000
You still got a load of stuff in her flat.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.560
You might still have
a wedding to go to together.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.160
You are on the joint headings
in your friends' address books.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.280
And that means I'm entitled
to see her underwear?

03:29.500 --> 03:30.283
If it comes up.

03:30.584 --> 03:31.689
That's the rules of the Zone.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.000
Good luck in there, Steve.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.129
You are a strange
and disturbing man, Jeff.

03:38.730 --> 03:39.130
Thank you.

03:41.175 --> 03:42.027
Steve

03:42.860 --> 03:44.112
Do you know what I call
this kind of woman,

03:44.341 --> 03:46.451
you know, the type you can't get rid of?

03:47.700 --> 03:49.600
Is this gonna be really tasteless?

03:50.420 --> 03:52.061
Am I gonna be ashamed
to be your friend?

03:52.251 --> 03:55.440
It's a technical term;
it's just a harmless expression.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.760
All right, hit me.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.778
Unflushable.

04:03.039 --> 04:04.140
- Turn around, Jeff. Walk away.
- You know,

04:04.260 --> 04:06.853
- 'coz they keep bobbin' around --
- No. No. You go, Jeff, go!

04:08.320 --> 04:08.840
Go.

04:11.260 --> 04:12.590
Don't look back. Go.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.200
Hi, Patrick.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.600
Hi, Susan.

04:26.340 --> 04:27.428
Hi, Steve.

04:29.020 --> 04:29.600
Jane.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.035
Steve and Jane

04:33.500 --> 04:35.980
And so my sister said no,
so I said yes.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.960
And then, she said no again,
so I just said yes.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.960
But then she said no,
so I said yes, yes, yes!

04:41.060 --> 04:43.280
How does the story end, exactly?

04:43.720 --> 04:45.787
She said I had
answer for everything.

04:46.597 --> 04:47.214
Right.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.062
- And I just said YES!
- Jane!

04:51.480 --> 04:53.656
Okay. Listen to me. Okay?

04:54.720 --> 04:56.680
I know I've tried
to say this before, and...

04:56.880 --> 04:58.711
and I know I never
seem to get anywhere,

04:59.460 --> 05:04.560
but this time, Jane, I'm gonna
put it very, very simply.

05:06.380 --> 05:07.520
It's over between us.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.080
- You want us to split up?
- Yes.

05:14.780 --> 05:16.320
Oh, yes, I do.

05:17.980 --> 05:18.960
I don't accept.

05:19.860 --> 05:21.840
- What?
- I don't accept it.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.917
No. No. No.
You can't not accept it.

05:24.218 --> 05:25.288
I'm breaking up with you.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.847
- Don't I get a say in it?
- Of course you don't.

05:27.942 --> 05:30.200
I even don't get a say in it,
then I don't accept it.

05:30.760 --> 05:31.134
Anyway,

05:31.280 --> 05:34.720
then my sister just looked
at me and she said no, no, no.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.440
Susan and Patrick

05:37.720 --> 05:39.605
Mary Kelly does not fancy you.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.470
I can tell from the way
she acts around me.

05:41.481 --> 05:42.601
She finds me attractive.

05:42.814 --> 05:46.581
Is there any form of female behaviour
you don't interpret as finding you attractive.

05:47.340 --> 05:48.920
It's never really come up.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.440
If you two are finished,

05:52.160 --> 05:53.760
I thought
you wanted to speak to me.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.129
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

05:56.340 --> 05:57.800
Could you give us a minute?

06:02.220 --> 06:04.420
Mary Kelly thinks
you are a complete idiot.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.440
Then why does she keep looking
at my arse when we are talking?

06:07.460 --> 06:09.160
She's lip-reading.

06:18.060 --> 06:19.170
We need to talk.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.000
Sure.

06:20.740 --> 06:22.960
About our relationship,

06:24.700 --> 06:28.400
I'm just starting to think it's all
getting a bit hard and heavy, and...

06:28.540 --> 06:31.720
We both need to back off
and cool down!

06:32.280 --> 06:35.120
You know, maybe we should just both
think about where everything's going,

06:35.340 --> 06:38.400
whether we are starting to
commit more than we intend to,

06:40.040 --> 06:41.080
or want to.

06:41.980 --> 06:42.920
What relationship?

06:46.060 --> 06:48.300
Then my sister said,
"Absolutely not."

06:48.340 --> 06:50.652
- So I said, "Absolutely yes!"

06:50.673 --> 06:53.320
It doesn't matter
whether you accept it or not.

06:54.140 --> 06:56.472
It's over.
You're dumped.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.129
Look, um,
it's not you. Okay?

07:06.003 --> 07:06.760
It's me.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.960
Then why am I the one
that's getting dumped?

07:11.620 --> 07:13.520
You should be the one
that gets dumped.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.760
Exactly.
It's all my fault.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.960
So dump me.

07:20.928 --> 07:23.005
No...

07:23.640 --> 07:24.000
What?

07:24.260 --> 07:27.040
We can work on your problems.

07:29.020 --> 07:30.073
I can't believe you!

07:30.760 --> 07:32.297
I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.160
I just never thought it's
a relationship as such.

07:35.340 --> 07:37.508
I just thought we're
having a bit of fun, a bit of sex.

07:37.760 --> 07:38.302
Ah, yeah.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.966
That's what I thought. I mean,
that's pretty much,

07:41.958 --> 07:43.599
pretty much the way I see things...

07:43.800 --> 07:45.200
- Well, you're alright?
- Yeah.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.800
I mean, it's not as if we've
been faithful or anything.

07:51.525 --> 07:52.636
Oooops!

07:53.020 --> 07:55.400
You've got to let me out, please!

07:56.500 --> 07:59.804
Look, why don't we
give it ... a year?

08:01.880 --> 08:02.933
Because if we give it a year,

08:03.112 --> 08:06.081
I will end up horribly murdering you
and hacking up your body.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.096
Okay. How long do you suggest?

08:12.940 --> 08:15.776
- I'm so sorry. I have no idea.
- It's fine.

08:16.171 --> 08:17.980
We are only seeing each other
once a week.

08:18.180 --> 08:20.080
That's not exactly a sex life.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.200
You must be doing
a lot of, um, solo flights.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.681
- No, I wasn't!
- Oh, come on!

08:27.700 --> 08:30.320
I certainly was not.
I was saving it all up for you.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.720
No. Really?

08:34.448 --> 08:35.405
Ooooops!

08:36.539 --> 08:38.443
Some relationships are
supposed to end;

08:38.482 --> 08:41.440
there are some relationships
the world is better off without.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.360
Remember Crippen?

08:44.039 --> 08:46.600
Here we go.
Bring up Crippen again.

08:46.820 --> 08:50.500
You seem to forgot the Crippens
enjoyed many happy years of marriage

08:50.500 --> 08:51.961
before he murdered her.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.200
Please, listen to me.

08:54.260 --> 08:56.644
They didn't just give it up straight away.
They worked at it.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.040
That's the real lesson of the Crippens.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.880
He killed her and
was hanged for her murder.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.960
Yes. Eventually.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.040
Look, I'm not saying
it wasn't good.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.280
I'm just saying it didn't seem
like a week's worth.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.800
No. Don't look like that.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.138
Not everyone has
my level of sex drive.

09:20.263 --> 09:24.109
- I mean, for start, you're a bloke...
- Alright! Alright.

09:24.544 --> 09:27.040
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but actually,

09:27.920 --> 09:29.840
I've been seeing someone else, too.

09:31.360 --> 09:32.720
You've been cheating on me?

09:34.620 --> 09:35.974
- What?
- Is this true, Patrick ?

09:36.020 --> 09:38.400
- But you were cheating on me!
- I wasn't cheating.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.840
I wasn't being faithful.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.160
You are being faithful,
and that means you are cheating.

09:42.660 --> 09:44.440
And I thought I knew you.

09:45.660 --> 09:47.440
D'you know what I'm going to do?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.200
I'm gonna walk out of here.

09:51.160 --> 09:54.320
Whether you accept it or not,
I'll never speak to you or see you again.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.159
That is it. Over.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.720
- Steve, we just ...
- Don't, Don't, Don't!

09:57.901 --> 10:01.201
Stop suggesting things, or telling me
what you are wearing,

10:01.480 --> 10:03.360
or doin' anything with your breasts.

10:04.420 --> 10:04.981
Going.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.541
Look, I just wanted you
to know something.

10:06.760 --> 10:07.960
Not like something to work, Jane.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.140
I experienced
the passionate connection with you

10:10.200 --> 10:11.670
that I've never encountered before.

10:11.840 --> 10:12.543
Not listening.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.200
I've never know love making so electric.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.289
No. It's having no effect.

10:17.420 --> 10:19.920
Except perhaps
once with Arthur.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.420
You know, the night
before he left for the Gulf.

10:23.640 --> 10:27.040
There is no level of cheap
manipulation that will work, Jane.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.240
Maybe a couple of times
with Elizabeth.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.360
Hey, Steve. Guess who.

10:37.660 --> 10:38.420
Listen, there's a...

10:38.680 --> 10:40.380
something I forgot to
tell you about the...

10:42.119 --> 10:47.080
Steve. Steve, you all right?

10:48.740 --> 10:50.680
I was this close.

10:53.615 --> 10:54.180
Evil.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.074
Susan, hey!

10:57.949 --> 10:58.672
Jeff, hi!

10:59.280 --> 11:01.926
You never
told me about Elizabeth.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.140
You know I've had
relationships with other women.

11:04.166 --> 11:05.136
No, you never tell me that.

11:05.921 --> 11:07.702
Not once
in the entire relationship.

11:07.980 --> 11:08.980
I begged.

11:10.620 --> 11:13.520
- Well, it's too late now.
- No! I'm still in the Zone.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.099
This is Patrick, and this is Jeff
who works in my office.

11:19.180 --> 11:20.080
Hi. Alright?

11:20.640 --> 11:21.680
Good to meet ya.

11:24.020 --> 11:26.726
So, how do you know Susan, then?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.383
She just dumped him.

11:28.680 --> 11:29.658
Aw. Great.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.624
Sense of my queue for loo break.
Excuse me a sec.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.880
So, dumped and still here in.

11:37.220 --> 11:39.440
So you are a blaaaaah...
You are unflushable?

11:55.760 --> 11:58.880
Um ...
Isn't this the ladies'?

12:00.240 --> 12:01.758
Sorry. Just um...

12:02.960 --> 12:04.240
just washing my hands.

12:05.460 --> 12:07.280
En'huh, and the money is for ... ?

12:09.568 --> 12:11.240
Do you get these free
in the ladies?

12:12.340 --> 12:13.240
Apparently.

12:17.180 --> 12:18.721
Well, I'm thinking, in terms of

12:18.821 --> 12:20.947
humiliating myself
in front of a complete stranger,

12:21.060 --> 12:23.120
this couldn't get
much more embarrassing, could it?

12:23.760 --> 12:25.605
So how are you
these days, Steve?

12:27.040 --> 12:27.980
Great.

12:28.860 --> 12:31.120
We met at my office party.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.880
Jeff invited you, I think.

12:33.140 --> 12:35.894
And you spent the whole evening
arguing with some woman

12:36.194 --> 12:37.401
about Crippen.

12:39.980 --> 12:41.380
Yeah. I was well insulted.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.454
I seem to remember I was
trying to cheer you up at the time.

12:45.561 --> 12:45.861
Oh...

12:47.360 --> 12:50.320
So, have you seen
that woman recently?

12:56.954 --> 12:58.480
Define "recently".

12:59.600 --> 13:00.720
- Okay. Look, I better ...
-No, no, no, no.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.077
Maybe we could um...

13:04.520 --> 13:07.720
you know, meet up sometime?

13:08.400 --> 13:10.523
Yeah. You know where I work.

13:10.804 --> 13:11.822
Jeff's got my number.

13:12.940 --> 13:14.640
Nothing to stop you
from calling me.

13:14.980 --> 13:15.651
Great.

13:16.360 --> 13:16.898
Great.

13:19.540 --> 13:20.200
Where're you going?

13:21.700 --> 13:23.580
- In there.
- Why? What are you gonna do?

13:25.180 --> 13:28.160
You know, that's not the level of
detail most people look for.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.275
Sorry, um...

13:31.480 --> 13:32.400
Still using it.

13:32.920 --> 13:33.520
What?

13:34.560 --> 13:35.520
Haven't finished.

13:37.105 --> 13:37.932
I was on a break.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.296
You got out to
wash your hands during your...

13:43.482 --> 13:43.991
Yes.

13:46.184 --> 13:47.320
It's been a tricky one.

13:57.080 --> 13:57.880
Look, look, um...

13:59.480 --> 14:00.920
I don't think this is
such a good idea anymore.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.480
You're just getting all confused again.

14:04.780 --> 14:08.600
I'll tell you what?
I'll take my clothes off.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.743
No, no, no, no.
That's not gonna work.

14:11.843 --> 14:13.665
Whatever you might think,
Whatever everybody might think,

14:13.760 --> 14:16.240
it just so happens I'm not ...
Completely Shaved!

14:17.240 --> 14:18.480
I mean, shallow.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.680
Your friend, Steve,
is he alright?

14:27.360 --> 14:30.208
Yeah, he's having
a bit of trouble at the moment.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.080
He's got an unflushable.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.699
Oh, I see. You mean he can't...

14:36.900 --> 14:39.280
No, no. Not so much can't.
He won't.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.080
He won't?

14:42.240 --> 14:44.560
The last minute,
he gets all sentimental.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.353
So back on you own again?
Back out there?

14:56.488 --> 14:59.080
You are smiling at me.
I don't think I've ever seen that.

15:00.300 --> 15:04.960
You are a single man now.
You qualify for my elasticity.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.320
Is that as good as it sounds?

15:11.360 --> 15:12.560
OUT OF ORDER

15:24.040 --> 15:26.320
How well do you know Susan?
Are you close?

15:26.620 --> 15:29.560
Close. I got her cycle
in my organizer.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.520
Well, wait. You are
thinking of asking her out?

15:33.760 --> 15:36.260
Now I really kind of.
Why? Is there a problem?

15:37.240 --> 15:38.480
Well, you and her... you know?

15:39.480 --> 15:42.480
Yeah, we gave it a try.
It was a long time ago.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.560
Didn't really work out.
I think I made her nervous.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.280
That's understandable.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.280
So you manage to
finish with Jane?

15:56.220 --> 15:57.440
Define "finish".

15:58.580 --> 16:01.040
Steve, have you
finished with Jane?

16:01.200 --> 16:02.400
Are you out of the Zone?

16:02.660 --> 16:05.240
Because if you ask Susan out
while you are still seeing Jane,

16:05.720 --> 16:07.640
that could be a problem later.

16:08.520 --> 16:13.280
So where were you Zone-wise
with Jane when you ask Susan out?

16:15.960 --> 16:20.047
Well, you know,
pretty much in there.

16:21.320 --> 16:24.880
Yeah, yeah. But where exactly
like um... middle, edge ...?

16:25.000 --> 16:25.720
During.

16:26.380 --> 16:26.900
During?

16:29.960 --> 16:32.560
- During?
- It's not as bas as it sounds.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.760
I was in a toilet cubical with Jane,

16:34.770 --> 16:37.360
and when I was nibbing out
to get a condom, I asked out Susan.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.800
The Zone has a new king,

16:44.680 --> 16:46.480
but you will rule alone.

16:54.258 --> 16:54.876
Jeff

16:55.977 --> 16:56.714
Hello!

16:58.960 --> 17:00.784
That Steve guy...

17:01.160 --> 17:03.280
How well d'you know him?
Are you close?

17:03.832 --> 17:04.339
Close.

17:04.800 --> 17:05.800
We're porn buddies.

17:06.000 --> 17:06.700
Porn buddies?

17:07.001 --> 17:08.001
Oh, yeah.

17:09.099 --> 17:10.160
Is this a code?

17:10.720 --> 17:12.880
You two in prison together
or something?

17:13.060 --> 17:16.560
No, no, no. It's ...
it's a safety precaution?

17:16.780 --> 17:20.401
You know, like a scuba diver dives
with a buddy in case you run out of air.

17:21.020 --> 17:25.000
Okay. So are you telling me that
a porn buddy stands by with oxygen.

17:25.675 --> 17:26.089
No.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.040
Many years ago, Steve and I
exchanged house keys.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.220
- Are you sure this isn't a code?
- It's not code.

17:37.321 --> 17:37.753
Alright!

17:38.100 --> 17:41.280
In the event of Steve's death,
the first thing I will do,

17:42.141 --> 17:44.000
upset though I will be,

17:44.840 --> 17:47.472
is go straight to his house
and remove all the pornography

17:47.540 --> 17:49.200
before his parents can find it.

17:49.380 --> 17:50.320
You are kidding.

17:50.580 --> 17:52.136
And he's placed to do the same for me!

17:52.436 --> 17:53.929
That's how close we are!

17:54.400 --> 17:57.600
You guys have seriously made
arrangements to destroy your dirty mags.

17:58.220 --> 18:00.700
Who said "destroy"? Removing!

18:01.189 --> 18:03.556
Yeah, but you wouldn't
keep them... would you?

18:05.280 --> 18:06.560
Well, it's a perk.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.360
- Oh, Jeff!
- That's the beauty of it, you see!

18:10.220 --> 18:12.960
Your best friend's dead,
but there's a bright side!

18:15.320 --> 18:17.680
- You are trying to put me off, aren't you?
- No way.

18:18.740 --> 18:19.840
Why would I do that?

18:20.840 --> 18:22.723
Well, I know it's
a long time ago, but um...

18:23.280 --> 18:24.080
you and me ... ?

18:25.280 --> 18:28.580
Yeah. Well, that didn't
really work out, did it?

18:28.780 --> 18:31.280
You know, I never understand
why I made you so nervous?

18:32.420 --> 18:34.180
I've never seen anyone
look so terrified.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.480
It's all in the past. That!

18:37.180 --> 18:39.080
Please, forget about it.

18:41.256 --> 18:41.752
Hello.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.125
Talk of the devil.
Hi, Steve.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.804
No, just talking
about you with Jeff.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.400
Your buddy.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.400
Tomorrow evening...
Tomorrow evening will be fine.

18:55.480 --> 18:58.280
May have to be a bit later.
I'm supposed to be having a facial.

18:58.744 --> 18:59.144
Okay.

19:00.760 --> 19:03.040
Then we can have
a good long chat about Jeff.

19:04.580 --> 19:07.040
Getting out of The Zone

19:13.760 --> 19:15.600
"Hello. This is Jane.
Sorry, I've got..."

19:16.000 --> 19:21.600
Cool! I'm out of the Zone!
I'm finally out.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.400
Jane, hi. This is Steve.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.553
Look, there's something
I've been trying to say, and um...

19:29.400 --> 19:31.120
I think by now you know
what it is.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.040
So, so just listen.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.840
You are a beautiful, sexy,
highly intelligent woman.

19:38.180 --> 19:40.443
And a man would have to be insane

19:40.543 --> 19:42.354
not to want to spend
the rest of his life with you.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.320
"This message tape is now full.
Please, hang up."

19:46.666 --> 19:49.524
"This message tape is now full.
Please, hang up."

19:56.000 --> 19:59.160
Jeff, I'm going on a date.
Why are you following me?

19:59.220 --> 20:01.400
I just think you might need
some last minute pointers.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.601
Jeff!

20:04.480 --> 20:08.240
Here's a point from me.
This is dinner for two.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.320
Quality nice.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.320
Susan's idea.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.230
She's gonna be
here in an hour.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.800
Do you know
the biggest turn-off on a first date?

20:28.980 --> 20:31.120
- You?
- Discussion of mutual friends.

20:32.504 --> 20:35.200
- An hour?
- Yes. She's having a facial.

20:35.980 --> 20:37.600
I'm trying to avoid someone.

20:37.660 --> 20:38.100
Who?

20:39.980 --> 20:41.080
Oh, my god!

20:41.509 --> 20:42.106
What?

20:45.743 --> 20:48.480
Have you been completely
clear with her that it's over?

20:50.413 --> 20:51.660
Hello, gorgeous.

20:54.850 --> 20:58.400
I got your lovely message.
You know, I feel quite flushed.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.446
How did you find me here?

20:59.600 --> 21:00.457
The usual.

21:00.680 --> 21:04.320
Alright. So what? You phoned my flat,
found I wasn't not there.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.380
Then you phoned all the
local taxi companies, and found out

21:06.400 --> 21:08.000
which one had picked me up
and where I'd gone.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.943
Then you phoned all the local restaurants

21:09.993 --> 21:11.127
and found out which one had my booking.

21:11.297 --> 21:14.880
Well, if I didn't do that,
how would we ever see each other?

21:16.450 --> 21:19.383
Remember the time I gave you
such a big fright you almost fainted?

21:19.950 --> 21:21.760
- Where was that?
- Prague.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.800
You should have seen
his little face. He cried!

21:27.440 --> 21:28.320
Jane, listen.

21:32.991 --> 21:33.680
Oh, my god!

21:33.960 --> 21:35.520
The Zone really hates you.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.640
Hi. Didn't expect you
to be here already.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.240
Didn't expect you.
Thought you are having a facial.

21:46.300 --> 21:46.840
She cancelled.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.640
- She cancelled?
- Yes. Okay. I was gonna cancel it anyway.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.720
- Don't really need it.
- Are you sure?

21:53.860 --> 21:56.560
- What are you saying?
- Nothing. I'm just worried about your face.

21:58.327 --> 21:58.635
Jeff.

22:00.650 --> 22:02.484
Susan. Haha...Hi.

22:03.230 --> 22:05.000
I thought you are
having a facial.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.973
- It was cancelled.
- Cancelled?!

22:09.060 --> 22:10.480
Would you want me
to have a word with him?

22:11.896 --> 22:13.284
- Hello.
- Hello.

22:16.300 --> 22:18.880
I'm Jane,
Steve's girlfriend.

22:20.580 --> 22:22.736
Susan.
Pleased to meet you.

22:24.592 --> 22:25.760
You have a girlfriend?!

22:26.208 --> 22:26.769
Well,

22:28.000 --> 22:28.880
At the moment.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.480
- At the moment!
- You are early.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.950
- You are seeing this woman?
- No, no, no, not for another hour.

22:41.236 --> 22:42.689
Okay. Yes.

22:43.124 --> 22:44.600
Yes, we are on a date.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.480
I'm sorry, Steve,
but I simply won't tolerate that.

22:49.070 --> 22:51.360
I'm very fond of you
and I hope we'll always be friends,

22:52.850 --> 22:55.260
but I'm afraid
this relationship is now over.

22:55.321 --> 22:56.493
Yes.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.400
Sorry.

22:59.000 --> 22:59.873
Just like that?

23:00.552 --> 23:01.840
I'm afraid so.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.709
- I just wished you had said something.
- What?

23:05.860 --> 23:07.280
Somebody wanna tell me
what's going on?

23:10.440 --> 23:12.040
Sally, what are you doing here?

23:12.360 --> 23:13.880
I was feeling guilty.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.720
I should never have
cancelled you facial.

23:20.423 --> 23:21.023
Patrick?

23:21.424 --> 23:21.928
Hi.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.148
What exactly is going on here?

23:25.160 --> 23:27.600
You are asking me? I can't
believe you are using our restaurant

23:27.650 --> 23:29.760
for you date!
That's so thoughtless.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.998
Patrick, you are using our restaurant
and my friend for your date.

23:33.840 --> 23:34.760
Okay, you win that one.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.620
So let me guess, you asked him out
the moment I dumped him.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.400
Sally, you don't even like him.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.840
I panicked. My neck
looked old this morning.

23:44.820 --> 23:45.760
We'll talk later.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.160
Steve, you and I will talk now.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.960
Well. Anyway...

23:50.530 --> 23:53.200
Here we all are on
Steve and Susan's 1st date.

23:53.260 --> 23:54.160
Isn't this great?

23:54.780 --> 23:58.008
Let's all have dinner
and plan the future.

23:58.110 --> 23:59.600
- Table for 6?
- Jeff...

24:01.020 --> 24:01.860
What are you doing?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.601
You worry we're gonna
talk about you or something?

24:05.731 --> 24:06.330
No.

24:07.027 --> 24:07.840
What is there to say?

24:08.060 --> 24:10.640
You know about him and me. Right?
The nervous thing?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.966
Well, yes, but don't worry about it.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.600
Jeff makes
loads of women nervous.

24:18.820 --> 24:20.320
You made me nervous?

24:20.680 --> 24:22.160
You told him
you made me nervous?

24:22.440 --> 24:24.680
"Mr. I've Lost All Feeling
Down My Left Side."

24:24.960 --> 24:28.120
"Mr. I Think All My Joints Locked Together,
Can You Carry Me Home?"

24:28.793 --> 24:29.299
Jeff?

24:29.454 --> 24:31.130
Didn't he tell you?
He fainted.

24:31.220 --> 24:34.360
Yeah, but I was only faking it so that
I wouldn't have to have sex with you!

24:36.800 --> 24:39.520
That wasn't
a great defense, was it?

24:43.673 --> 24:45.880
Sex can be very
stressful for men.

24:47.190 --> 24:51.760
You judge us on technique,
sensitivity, stamina.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.480
we're just happy if you're
naked...half naked...

24:55.745 --> 24:56.480
one breast.

24:57.220 --> 24:59.680
Oh, Jeff. I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.187
Yeah. Well, you won't
be hearing it anymore.

25:01.222 --> 25:03.680
I'm staying and monitoring
the rest of your conversation.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.576
Jeff, I wanna
talk to Steve privately.

25:06.611 --> 25:08.980
No. No. You are both friends of mine.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.000
If you get together,
it affects me.

25:11.380 --> 25:13.360
I'm a legitimate part
of this date.

25:13.380 --> 25:15.520
- Go away, Jeff.
- Please.

25:15.580 --> 25:18.320
What do we have to do here?
Beg? Show you a breast?

25:18.340 --> 25:19.840
Look, all I'm saying is that ...

25:22.345 --> 25:23.043
Okay.

25:24.700 --> 25:26.273
- What?
- Okay.

25:27.455 --> 25:29.320
- Okay what?
- Okay on the breast thing.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.000
I'll go
in exchange for the breast.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.840
- I wasn't serious.
- Too late. I was.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.480
You've already seen them.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.880
Yeah. During a panic attack,
I was blind.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.240
You can take them now?

25:43.953 --> 25:44.958
Well, singly.

25:46.300 --> 25:49.120
I wasn't serious, Jeff. You really think
I'm gonna flush you in public?

25:49.480 --> 25:51.440
We are in a corner.
I don't think anyone else will see.

25:53.320 --> 25:57.500
Patrick. What are you doing?
I mean, you've seen them lots of times.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.480
Yeah, but now, you are an ex.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.360
Oh Yeah! It's the best!

26:04.420 --> 26:05.360
What are you two doing?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.800
Always good to see
a friend's breast, unsupported

26:10.420 --> 26:12.916
And I just like
looking at breasts.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.920
Oh, this just
gets better and better.

26:18.084 --> 26:19.674
Will you people
get it into your heads?

26:19.774 --> 26:21.339
I'm not doing this.

26:25.861 --> 26:26.894
Steve!

26:27.400 --> 26:29.080
Just in case you do do it.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.300
You know, technically,
I'm on a date with you.

26:31.330 --> 26:33.840
I don't wanna end up
a breast behind everybody else.

26:35.370 --> 26:37.480
- Actually, Susan, that's fair.
- I agree.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.039
D'you know what?
I am gonna do this.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.781
I'm gonna do this just to show you

26:44.831 --> 26:48.156
how low, pathetic and desperate
you've all become.

26:48.280 --> 26:49.400
Result!

26:50.780 --> 26:52.240
But I want you to remember,

26:52.400 --> 26:54.788
I intend this breast satiricly.

26:55.300 --> 26:57.400
Now there's a sentence
that can't come out too often.

26:58.354 --> 26:58.655
Okay.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.946
Which one?
Any preference?

27:02.087 --> 27:02.680
Either.

27:03.240 --> 27:03.920
Don't mind.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.235
The right one.

27:07.960 --> 27:08.440
Trust me.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.200
What wrong with the left one?

27:13.400 --> 27:15.738
Don't be like that.
There has to be a second place.

27:15.980 --> 27:17.680
I wasn't aware
you'd assessed them individually.

27:17.700 --> 27:18.920
You're asleep. I was bored.

27:22.560 --> 27:25.698
Fine. But remember this is to
show you how low you have sunk.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.680
- Yeah, but we get to see a breast. Right?
- Yes.

27:28.083 --> 27:28.381
Cool.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.400
Ok. Here we go.

27:31.760 --> 27:32.444
Fire one.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.440
No, no. That's the left.
We want the good one.

27:43.720 --> 27:46.760
If you only could see
how stupid you all look.

27:50.270 --> 27:51.330
Table for 6, please.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.580
I'm sorry.
I think we are fully booked.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.920
She's got another one
just like it, you know.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.680
Yeah, well, pretty much.

27:58.202 --> 27:59.264
Patrick.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.560
Perhaps, we are not fully booked.
Let me go and see what I can do.

28:05.140 --> 28:06.880
I thought the plan was
to get rid of everyone.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.560
New plan. Let's see.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.614
Your ex, my ex;

28:11.800 --> 28:14.029
your best friend,
my best friend.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.564
Every new relationship
has baggage,

28:16.580 --> 28:18.280
so why not
invite it all out for dinner.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.478
So I take
this isn't a date any more.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.389
- Or is it? Are we still ...
- Steve,

28:29.900 --> 28:31.604
I think, in our circumstances,

28:32.620 --> 28:36.800
let's just take it
one breast at a time.

28:39.618 --> 28:42.325
