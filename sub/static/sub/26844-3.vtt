<i>NARRATOR: Previously on Mars.</i>

00:03.766 --> 00:05.918
HANA: It's important I share
my experience with you,

00:05.944 --> 00:07.482
commander to commander.

00:07.589 --> 00:11.285
KURT: There are no real boundaries
here, not for Lukrum anyway.

00:11.322 --> 00:13.913
We didn't sign the outer space
treaty, and we aren't even based

00:13.949 --> 00:15.227
in a country that did sign it.

00:15.263 --> 00:17.693
AMELIE: I'm pregnant.
It's not like I planned this.

00:17.693 --> 00:19.916
JAVIER: No, you just planned to leave.

00:19.952 --> 00:22.314
AMELIE: I don't know what to do.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.920
JEN: I came here for the adventure.

00:24.957 --> 00:27.700
MARTA: Where you see a red,
dusty planet, I see beauty.

00:27.737 --> 00:30.967
I just have to show progress, and I
can only do so much on the surface.

00:31.004 --> 00:33.609
Maybe those bastards at
Lukrum had the right idea.

00:33.645 --> 00:34.999
WOMAN: Did you see something?

00:35.036 --> 00:36.215
KURT: Only what we're looking for.

00:36.251 --> 00:37.258
MARTA: Well, that was lucky.

00:37.294 --> 00:39.031
MAN: Finding water, that was lucky.

00:39.068 --> 00:41.082
MARTA: You need to tell
us where the water is.

00:41.118 --> 00:43.758
KURT: You're one crazy
bitch, you know that?

00:43.794 --> 00:45.461
MARTA: This planet doesn't belong to you.

00:45.497 --> 00:48.555
It doesn't belong to anyone,
especially if there's life here.

00:48.591 --> 00:50.258
MAN: I thought she was sleeping.

00:50.294 --> 00:52.168
She's not breathing. I need help.

00:52.206 --> 00:56.623
JOON: Because it was always my
dream to be with you on Mars.

DOCTOR: How's your appetite?

01:45.384 --> 01:46.736
HANA: Fine.

01:53.168 --> 01:54.557
DOCTOR: Are you sleeping alright?

02:00.814 --> 02:02.342
HANA: Yes.

02:02.379 --> 02:03.767
DOCTOR: Any changes in mood?

02:03.804 --> 02:07.277
Any anger? Depression, anxiety?

02:08.461 --> 02:10.961
HANA: Nothing beyond what's
normal for the situation.

02:12.284 --> 02:16.037
DOCTOR: Well, though there are
some common stages of grief.

02:16.073 --> 02:19.748
I don't think we should be talking in
terms of what's normal and what's not.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.709
Can you tell me, have you been
having any negative thoughts?

02:28.933 --> 02:30.321
HANA: No, not really.

02:31.226 --> 02:33.303
What are you getting at exactly?

02:34.471 --> 02:36.682
DOCTOR: I'm not getting at anything.

02:36.719 --> 02:40.019
It's been three months since Joon died.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.521
I'm just trying to help you process.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.024
HANA: What would really help is
letting me get back to work.

02:47.631 --> 02:51.158
DOCTOR: When a loved one suddenly dies,

02:51.183 --> 02:53.288
we often feel more than a sense of loss.

02:53.324 --> 02:56.006
Often, there's a sense of guilt.

02:56.042 --> 02:58.887
And rather than dealing
with the pain of that,

02:58.912 --> 03:00.914
it becomes easier to postpone.

03:04.558 --> 03:07.129
You have to allow yourself to feel, Hana.

03:08.834 --> 03:11.264
HANA: I don't have that luxury.

03:11.921 --> 03:13.413
Not here.

03:29.825 --> 03:33.264
CAMERON: Pretty sure our drones
weren't designed for stalking.

03:33.301 --> 03:36.049
MARTA: I'm just monitoring
Lukrum's progress,

03:36.074 --> 03:37.610
if that's what you want to call it.

03:37.646 --> 03:41.371
And if I hadn't, we wouldn't
even know where the aquifer was.

03:41.783 --> 03:44.041
They certainly weren't going to tell us.

03:44.945 --> 03:48.384
CAMERON: But what they are doing
over there isn't all bad, you know.

03:48.421 --> 03:51.894
I mean, they can get underneath the
surface here in a way we never could.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.597
MARTA: You're right.

03:53.635 --> 03:56.204
That's why I watch them
as closely as I do.

03:58.420 --> 04:02.267
Not that's there's been much to
see for the last two months.

04:02.845 --> 04:04.161
CAMERON: It's taking them a while

04:04.186 --> 04:06.134
to print and assemble
that drilling equipment?

04:06.563 --> 04:08.523
MARTA: Is that inside information?

04:11.684 --> 04:15.471
CAMERON: Look, I know you're not a
fan of the company they work for,

04:15.507 --> 04:19.701
but the people at Lukrum
colony are pretty great.

04:20.547 --> 04:22.677
MARTA: Spoken like someone who
is sleeping with the enemy.

04:23.163 --> 04:26.176
CAMERON: Jen is not the enemy, okay.

04:26.212 --> 04:29.685
She's someone who I really care about.

04:29.722 --> 04:31.736
MARTA: You know what?

04:31.773 --> 04:33.891
None of my business.

04:38.203 --> 04:40.252
CAMERON: What's going on over there?

04:40.289 --> 04:42.372
MARTA: I picked their spot!

04:44.773 --> 04:47.446
JAVIER: It's amazing, isn't it?

04:47.483 --> 04:50.158
I mean, look at the face.

04:50.195 --> 04:54.710
AMELIE: Well, actually I'm
looking at bone development.

04:56.405 --> 04:58.012
JAVIER: And?

04:58.824 --> 05:00.758
AMELIE: Within range.

05:00.795 --> 05:04.079
Comparable to a fetus
on Earth at 16 weeks.

05:05.140 --> 05:06.527
JAVIER: Thank God.

05:06.565 --> 05:09.759
AMELIE: Her organs appear to be
developing normally as well.

05:09.797 --> 05:11.185
Heart, liver.

05:11.222 --> 05:12.471
JAVIER: Her?

05:12.508 --> 05:13.757
You said her?

05:13.794 --> 05:15.096
AMELIE: Oh yeah.

05:15.132 --> 05:17.720
I'm sorry, I should have led with that.

05:17.756 --> 05:19.109
It's a girl.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.880
_

05:21.880 --> 05:23.181
_

05:27.487 --> 05:29.120
JAVIER: It's a little girl.

05:34.856 --> 05:37.427
AMELIE: It's still early
in the process, Javier.

05:37.702 --> 05:39.194
Okay?

05:39.219 --> 05:40.397
JAVIER: Okay.

05:43.445 --> 05:45.445
_

05:53.728 --> 05:55.637
MIKE: Not much to get excited about.

05:55.675 --> 05:59.509
Permafrost cap is only half a
percent smaller than it used to be.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.266
HANA: Once they start covering a
larger area, we'll see changes.

06:07.934 --> 06:10.167
We have to.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.647
MIKE: You okay?

06:13.435 --> 06:16.701
HANA: Yeah, other than having to
answer that question all the time.

06:16.737 --> 06:18.647
MARTA: They've started.

06:18.683 --> 06:20.385
I sent you the drone footage.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.949
Did you get it?

06:21.985 --> 06:23.930
HANA: No. What's going on?

06:23.967 --> 06:27.128
MARTA: Lukrum, they're actively drilling.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.978
They didn't notify you?

06:30.643 --> 06:33.083
HANA: Marta, we've been through this.

06:34.377 --> 06:35.945
They don't have to notify me.

06:35.982 --> 06:38.805
MARTA: Right, because nobody holds
them accountable for anything.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.586
HANA: I don't know
what you want me to do.

06:41.623 --> 06:42.976
MARTA: Your job.

06:43.014 --> 06:47.120
Notify the command that I need
to gather samples on site.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.343
Immediately.

06:49.380 --> 06:51.314
HANA: I can't do that. MARTA: Why not?

06:52.074 --> 06:54.968
HANA: There's no official
communication between our colonies.

06:55.488 --> 06:57.309
And we've been instructed by IMSF

06:57.334 --> 06:59.447
not to interfere with
Lukrum's operations.

06:59.484 --> 07:01.012
MARTA: Well, that's stupid.

07:01.048 --> 07:02.364
And wrong.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.967
Our mission was to explore this planet,

07:05.992 --> 07:07.789
not to sit back and watch
it being exploited

07:07.825 --> 07:09.874
by corporate thugs.

07:09.911 --> 07:13.037
HANA: Look, I am just as
frustrated as you are.

07:13.074 --> 07:16.721
Do you think I want to sit by and
watch them trash the planet?

07:16.759 --> 07:18.007
No.

07:18.044 --> 07:19.710
I don't.

07:19.747 --> 07:22.977
But I have trust that IMSF is doing
all they can to keep them in check.

07:23.015 --> 07:25.862
MARTA: We're talking about
finding a second genesis!

07:27.430 --> 07:32.084
A new biochemical life form that's
unrelated to anything on Earth.

07:32.811 --> 07:35.231
And if it is anywhere on this planet,

07:37.364 --> 07:38.557
it's in the liquid water

07:38.591 --> 07:40.239
that is buried deep underground.

07:40.277 --> 07:41.439
HANA: Mhm.

07:41.475 --> 07:43.922
MARTA: So are you really going
to sit there and do nothing

07:43.947 --> 07:46.366
while they potentially destroy all that?

07:46.974 --> 07:48.466
Whose side are you on?

07:48.491 --> 07:49.496
Huh?

07:49.521 --> 07:51.291
Whose side are you on?

07:51.316 --> 07:54.026
HANA: The side of following orders!

07:55.709 --> 07:59.738
You are not to contact or interfere
with Lukrum's activities.

08:00.036 --> 08:02.049
Am I making myself clear?

08:26.868 --> 08:29.467
ELON: One of the first things
to understand about Mars

08:29.492 --> 08:32.775
is whether there was primordial
life there.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.432
I don't think there was
complex life there,

08:34.457 --> 08:37.467
but there may have been bacterial life

08:37.504 --> 08:40.595
and there may still be bacterial
life deep underground.

08:40.631 --> 08:43.940
So if there's some mining operation

08:43.965 --> 08:47.338
and they find life that
the previous scientific

08:47.374 --> 08:50.709
expeditions didn't know were
there, pause for a minute.

08:50.745 --> 08:52.447
There's a lot to be learned from that.

08:53.746 --> 08:56.745
I think it would be a
real tension between

08:56.770 --> 08:59.780
scientists who want to
keep Mars as untouched

08:59.816 --> 09:04.056
as a science lab, and
interests that are financial.

09:04.092 --> 09:06.504
So scientists will have to fight

09:06.529 --> 09:08.956
to do the scientific work
that has to be done,

09:08.992 --> 09:12.949
even if it is greeted
with opposition or fear.

09:13.596 --> 09:17.895
Any time the process of
science reaches a conclusion

09:17.920 --> 09:19.939
that is threatening to either

09:19.975 --> 09:25.083
an ideology or a desired reality,
you are going to face pushback.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.577
Global warming.

09:26.614 --> 09:29.878
It has become in effect a
religion rather than a science.

09:29.916 --> 09:33.145
Global warming and da, da, a
lot of it's a hoax, it's a hoax.

09:33.182 --> 09:36.343
MARC: We have had no significant
warming, uh, since 1998.

09:36.381 --> 09:38.568
Actually no warming. We've
been cooling in recent years.

09:38.605 --> 09:43.224
Right now we're facing a crisis
in our society, about science.

09:43.262 --> 09:45.902
Today, the EPA blocked its own scientists

09:45.927 --> 09:47.639
from speaking about climate change.

09:47.675 --> 09:51.090
CDC is now banned from using seven words

09:51.115 --> 09:52.817
or phrases in its budget document.

09:52.855 --> 09:55.345
ADAM: It has gotten so bad now,

09:55.370 --> 09:58.827
that scientists are being restricted
in terms of what they can say.

09:58.864 --> 10:01.392
And if we can't hear what
science is telling us,

10:01.417 --> 10:03.697
the consequences are going to be
dire for everybody.

10:09.364 --> 10:11.586
<i>JASON (OVER RADIO): As you fly in, you'll
be able to see there's a big river.</i>

10:11.623 --> 10:15.235
<i>I think if we can set down somewhere
there, that would be excellent.</i>

10:15.272 --> 10:19.233
<i>Uh, it's so much wetter
than it was the other day.</i>

10:19.269 --> 10:21.248
<i>This is going to be an
awful place to camp.</i>

10:26.464 --> 10:28.810
I built my career on being willing

10:28.835 --> 10:30.182
to go into environments that other people

10:30.218 --> 10:33.899
have considered uh, uh, inaccessible.

10:34.743 --> 10:36.238
Being on the Greenland Ice Sheet's

10:36.263 --> 10:37.827
probably about as close
to going to another

10:37.865 --> 10:40.081
planet as you can get,
and still be on Earth.

10:41.166 --> 10:42.809
We'll be out here for a
month or two months,

10:42.834 --> 10:44.603
so we have to be completely
self-sufficient.

10:44.641 --> 10:48.289
We're basically stuck there
until someone comes to get us.

10:48.325 --> 10:52.666
Alright, keep the tent low. Sit on it.

10:52.703 --> 10:53.970
MAN: Got a tap here.

10:55.033 --> 10:58.993
JASON: It's pretty physically
demanding, it's mentally demanding.

10:59.030 --> 11:01.137
An average person might
look up and just be like,

11:01.162 --> 11:04.276
oh, that's a horrific place, why
would anybody want to go there?

11:04.313 --> 11:07.369
The scientist in me thinks, this is data.

11:07.407 --> 11:10.253
We're out here to figure out exactly

11:10.278 --> 11:11.853
how fast the Greenland
Ice Sheet is melting.

11:11.891 --> 11:15.300
REPORTER: Ice caps are melting
and temperatures are rising

11:15.325 --> 11:16.963
according to a new UN report.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.012
BARACK: Arctic temperatures are rising

11:19.037 --> 11:21.515
about twice as fast as
the global average.

11:21.552 --> 11:25.590
ELLEN: We're seeing an
incredible amount of ice loss

11:25.615 --> 11:27.286
from the ice sheets in Greenland.

11:28.851 --> 11:30.858
That ice is going into the ocean,

11:30.883 --> 11:32.943
which is contributing to sea level rise.

11:32.980 --> 11:35.320
JOE: If sea levels rise two feet,

11:35.345 --> 11:38.060
tens of millions of
people will be displaced.

11:38.096 --> 11:41.188
REPORTER: Around 145 million
people around the world live

11:41.224 --> 11:43.934
less than three feet above sea level.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.164
ANNOUNCER 2: And a rising
sea level threat poses

11:46.189 --> 11:49.530
a continuing threat to cities and
industries at low elevations.

11:49.566 --> 11:53.376
JASON: Yes, climate change is
real, yes, people are causing it,

11:53.412 --> 11:56.133
and we probably need to
do something about it.

11:56.950 --> 12:02.238
SUSAN: A scientist is someone who
asks what is the bigger story,

12:02.263 --> 12:06.049
what is the truth that needs to be
brought in front of the public?

12:06.086 --> 12:10.255
For a scientist to continue to research,
in the face of either skepticism or

12:10.291 --> 12:12.065
even out and out opposition,

12:12.090 --> 12:15.632
you've got to be really brave
to keep on doing that.

12:24.528 --> 12:26.369
<i>VOICE (OVER COMPUTER):
Voice comm from Cameron.</i>

12:26.394 --> 12:28.339
CAMERON: Hey I've been
looking for you everywhere.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.275
Where are you?

12:30.803 --> 12:32.851
MARTA: Honestly, best you don't know.

12:32.876 --> 12:35.272
CAMERON: Hope that means you're not
doing anything you shouldn't be?

12:35.297 --> 12:37.380
MARTA: No, just doing
what needs to be done.

13:05.692 --> 13:07.602
I knew it.

13:07.639 --> 13:11.773
AMELIE: Yeah, and so far at least,
she seems to be developing normally.

13:11.810 --> 13:14.867
I wanted to tell you in

when you decided to leave, hmm?

13:51.965 --> 13:57.132
AMELIE: Yeah, but now I'm not, so,
what does that make us to each other,

other than parents to a child
who may or may not be okay?

14:01.564 --> 14:03.584

20:45.714 --> 20:47.163

20:47.188 --> 20:49.358
shouldn't getting off backup
power be our priority?

20:49.395 --> 20:51.333
Emergency generators
will only last so long,

20:51.358 --> 20:53.405
and we've got 200 people
to worry about here.

20:53.442 --> 20:57.112

and heat to last us for several days.

20:57.150 --> 20:59.163

20:59.200 --> 21:01.145
MIKE: She doesn't need to
contact us to get back.

21:01.181 --> 21:04.052
Her TR navigation should
get her here no problem.

21:04.086 --> 21:06.690
HANA: And what if that
wasn't working either?

21:06.727 --> 21:08.220
It's nightfall.

21:08.257 --> 21:11.035
If she could have been here
by now, she would have been.

21:11.072 --> 21:14.840
And without radio beacons, we can't
find her, and she can't find us.

21:20.387 --> 21:22.192
MARTA: This doesn't look right.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.077

21:25.114 --> 21:26.675
Where the hell am I?

21:31.045 --> 21:33.685
JOEL: We know what it's like
to be in a harsh environment

21:34.360 --> 21:37.682
and to risk everything for science.

21:38.190 --> 21:40.984
I mean, we've been doing it up
in the Arctic for a long time.

21:41.214 --> 21:43.748
The stakes are so high here.

21:44.078 --> 21:49.698
You've got minus 40 degrees, you
know, horrible storms, white-outs.

21:49.735 --> 21:53.288
There's an inability to rescue
people when things go wrong.

21:53.325 --> 21:58.050
So for scientists the reward has to
be great for them to go up there.

21:58.833 --> 22:01.333
_

22:12.824 --> 22:16.435
JASON: I caution everybody to stay
away from the actual river bank.

22:17.153 --> 22:19.842
If you were to slip and fall, or wind up
in the water, you're just going to get

22:19.879 --> 22:21.510
sucked down the hole.

22:22.555 --> 22:24.916
A lot of things could go wrong out here.

22:25.870 --> 22:28.865
We're taking a sensor
that measures basically

22:28.890 --> 22:31.479
how much melting that we've
had on the ice sheet,

22:31.515 --> 22:34.235
and we're lowering that into these giant,

22:34.271 --> 22:36.178
hundreds of meter-deep waterfalls.

22:36.214 --> 22:39.535
The big concern any time we make an
initial approach up to the edge,

22:39.571 --> 22:41.337
is the stability of the ice.

22:41.375 --> 22:44.321
There's a lot of rapids that can undercut

22:44.346 --> 22:46.685
some of the areas that
we'd be standing on.

22:46.721 --> 22:49.118
If something were to
collapse underneath of me,

22:49.143 --> 22:52.513
the water's just a fraction of a degree
above freezing.

22:52.550 --> 22:54.863
Uh, I'd lose my ability
to use my hands very,

22:54.888 --> 22:57.492
very quickly so we always
want to be prepared

22:57.528 --> 22:59.818
in the event that
something does go wrong.

22:59.854 --> 23:02.506
All right, so I'm going
to probe out to the edge,

23:02.531 --> 23:04.157
I'm going to come back and grab
the cable.

23:04.193 --> 23:06.577
When we're ready to go,
I'll let everybody know.

23:08.642 --> 23:11.621
Nobody's tried to do this here
on the Greenland ice sheet

23:11.657 --> 23:14.585
so we're pretty
motivated to make it work.

23:16.984 --> 23:18.685
We're all set here to start lowering.

23:18.721 --> 23:20.422
It's a pretty monster hole.

23:20.459 --> 23:22.275
Looks like we can send
the cable straight down

23:22.300 --> 23:24.090
the waterfall so whenever you're

23:24.126 --> 23:26.565
ready, I'm going to start lowering.

23:26.601 --> 23:30.451
The pursuit of science requires
a kind of dogged determination

23:30.476 --> 23:34.188
and passion to find the answer
to the question you pose.

23:36.100 --> 23:39.460
There's terrific risk
going out to these areas,

23:39.485 --> 23:41.822
but scientists become tunnel vision,

23:41.858 --> 23:46.191
and they'll block out anything else
that's a distraction

23:46.227 --> 23:49.411
to get the answer to that one question.

25:09.733 --> 25:10.982
MARTA: But what direction?

25:11.018 --> 25:12.407
<i>VOICE (OVER COMPUTER):
Navigation is unavailable.</i>

25:12.443 --> 25:14.163
MARTA: I know!

25:15.016 --> 25:17.481
I was talking to myself.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.796
They must be looking for me by now.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.716
I should just stay put.

25:30.387 --> 25:33.015
Stay put, conserve as
much energy as you can.

25:36.530 --> 25:41.880
Mae, Mae, how much power
does my suit have left?

25:41.917 --> 25:44.568
<i>VOICE (OVER COMPUTER):
One hour, 22 minutes.</i>

25:49.077 --> 25:54.218
MARTA: How long will this vehicle remain
operational if I continue using heat?

25:54.255 --> 25:56.304
<i>VOICE (OVER COMPUTER): Two hours
at current interior temperature,</i>

25:56.340 --> 25:58.665
<i>which is 18 degrees Celsius.</i>

26:04.960 --> 26:07.217
MARTA: Turn off interior heat.

26:07.574 --> 26:08.892
Damn it.

26:11.176 --> 26:12.807
<i>VOICE (OVER COMPUTER): Heat off.</i>

26:16.604 --> 26:22.689
MARTA: Mae, lower suit temperature
to five degrees Celsius.

26:23.275 --> 26:25.567
AMELIE: What about using
our drones to find her?

26:25.592 --> 26:27.083
MAN: They're practically
useless at night.

26:27.108 --> 26:30.964
AMELIE: Then what about contacting
Earth, or the Chinese space station,

26:31.000 --> 26:32.805
and using their satellites?

26:33.575 --> 26:35.447
HANA: There are only
five circling the planet.

26:35.483 --> 26:38.193
Searching for her that way
is a needle in a haystack.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.807
MIKE: Hopefully Marta was
smart enough to stay put

26:40.832 --> 26:43.268
and reduce her power usage when
she realized something was wrong.

26:43.304 --> 26:45.604
She's got at least some
power in her suit,

26:45.629 --> 26:47.418
for when exterior temps drop to 70 below.

26:47.424 --> 26:49.596
HANA: My guess is she used
most of it collecting samples.

26:49.664 --> 26:53.138
And since the rover's battery-powered
she could have kept driving,

26:53.175 --> 26:56.057
thinking she could find
her way back herself.

26:56.095 --> 26:57.796
AMELIE: So what are you saying?

26:59.184 --> 27:01.328
HANA: That without navigation,

27:01.353 --> 27:03.148
she could be miles away
from where she started,

27:03.184 --> 27:04.885
in any direction.

27:04.922 --> 27:07.776
She could freeze to
death before we find her.

27:10.135 --> 27:12.879
ROBERT: It's so cold out
here I can barely move.

27:13.756 --> 27:15.526
JAVIER: I know me too.

27:18.721 --> 27:22.820
ROBERT: We need to find this soon.

27:25.776 --> 27:29.216
There we go. Ugh!

27:29.252 --> 27:31.127
JAVIER: Are you okay?

27:31.164 --> 27:33.073
ROBERT: Yeah, let's hurry up and do this!

27:33.110 --> 27:35.762
JAVIER: Yeah. Every second counts.

27:38.808 --> 27:41.414
ROBERT: Let's see what we've got here.

27:45.939 --> 27:47.635
Looks pretty fried, all right.

27:47.672 --> 27:49.407
Fuses, relays.

27:49.444 --> 27:51.493
Anything can be fixed.

27:51.529 --> 27:54.170
It's just a question of how
long it's going to take.

27:56.708 --> 28:00.218
JAVIER: Marta can't have much
battery power left in the rover.

28:00.254 --> 28:01.573
Not right now.

28:01.609 --> 28:02.926
I'm worried.

28:02.962 --> 28:05.256
ROBERT: Yeah, me too.
For her and for Hana.

28:05.294 --> 28:09.505
Between us, I don't think she
can handle losing anyone else.

28:14.921 --> 28:16.378
JAVIER: What is it?

28:16.415 --> 28:17.886
ROBERT: It's not working.

28:17.922 --> 28:19.889
Something's wrong.

28:20.849 --> 28:23.685
JAVIER: I just hope to God
we can figure it out in time.

28:27.572 --> 28:29.655
MIKE: The radiation
surge has now subsided.

28:29.693 --> 28:32.992
AMELIE: Radiation exposure is
the least of Marta's problems.

28:33.028 --> 28:35.797
MIKE: If she was in the
rover when the flare hit,

28:35.822 --> 28:38.617
then she'd be protected.

28:49.642 --> 28:51.691
<i>VOICE (OVER COMPUTER):
Suit level critically low.</i>

28:51.727 --> 28:54.007
<i>30 seconds remaining.</i>

28:56.489 --> 28:59.012
MARTA: I guess I don't need this anymore.

29:06.047 --> 29:09.982
Mae, switch on the light.

29:15.814 --> 29:18.557
How much power if I keep it on?

29:18.594 --> 29:21.880
<i>VOICE (OVER COMPUTER): The rover
has less than 5% remaining.</i>

29:21.917 --> 29:23.829
<i>It is not advisable.</i>

29:25.927 --> 29:27.916
MARTA: Mae.

29:29.658 --> 29:31.359
Switch the light off.

29:36.720 --> 29:39.568
ELON: Mars is for those who
have an adventurous spirit.

29:39.605 --> 29:43.704
And are willing to accept a much
higher level of, of danger.

29:43.741 --> 29:46.368
But they'd have to love the frontier

29:46.393 --> 29:48.854
and really want to see what
the universe is all about.

29:50.275 --> 29:52.207
If there's a place you've never been,

29:52.232 --> 29:54.583
there's a scientist who wants to know
what's there.

29:54.619 --> 29:58.363
Just a curiosity of inquiry.

30:01.362 --> 30:08.707
That as a general state of mind has
taken science to every frontier.

30:09.634 --> 30:12.587
JASON: People ask me what I'm going
to do when I get back to real life,

30:12.624 --> 30:18.112
but I feel like this is the real life,
and what I do back home is the uh,

30:18.150 --> 30:20.233
the alternate life.

30:21.659 --> 30:25.238
I think scientists generally tend
to be more interested in the natural

30:25.275 --> 30:27.636
world than they are in other people.

30:28.644 --> 30:32.787
True scientists need a
degree of independence.

30:32.823 --> 30:37.090
They spend their life in search of
data and new scientific discovery.

30:38.446 --> 30:41.921
JANE: Day after day, I
climbed into the hills.

30:42.624 --> 30:44.846
This was where I was meant to be.

30:45.919 --> 30:50.088
SYLVIA: You have the joy of saying I
really want to know what's out there.

30:50.126 --> 30:51.965
Those are the explorers.

30:55.374 --> 30:58.190
TOM: When you go work
in these remote areas,

30:58.215 --> 31:00.674
you know, you're away
from family and friends,

31:01.468 --> 31:03.731
and after you've had a
career of doing that,

31:03.756 --> 31:06.014
that's a pretty big sacrifice to make.

31:08.617 --> 31:12.057
JASON: Being gone most of the
year, my family worries about me,

31:12.854 --> 31:15.741
but they just accept
that this is my life.

31:16.942 --> 31:20.468
When you're out here in the
absolute middle of nowhere, I mean,

31:20.505 --> 31:23.387
you don't have all the
distractions of the outside world.

31:23.424 --> 31:25.425
You know, you spend a lot of time

31:25.450 --> 31:27.697
just reflecting on who you
are as a person

31:28.299 --> 31:30.998
and what really matters in life.

31:31.035 --> 31:33.542
Science outlives all of us.

31:43.802 --> 31:45.721
MARTA: Mae.

31:48.380 --> 31:50.496
How much power left?

31:50.534 --> 31:52.443
<i>VOICE (OVER COMPUTER): 2% remaining.</i>

33:38.973 --> 33:41.169
MARTA: (INAUDIBLE) IMSF.

33:44.174 --> 33:45.431
I'm going to Mars.

34:11.331 --> 34:13.067
JAVIER: This is hard.

34:13.105 --> 34:15.292
ROBERT: Yeah, the cold
makes everything brittle.

34:15.328 --> 34:18.036
JAVIER: No, I'm talking
about this damn planet.

34:18.074 --> 34:21.965
ROBERT: Says the father
of the first Martian.

34:22.668 --> 34:24.607
JAVIER: If she's even born.

34:24.643 --> 34:26.831
Amelie's right.

34:27.799 --> 34:30.132
This is not a place for human beings.

34:30.170 --> 34:32.914
ROBERT: You think Earth
is any less hostile?

34:32.949 --> 34:35.520
Solar flare hits there too, you know.

34:35.556 --> 34:40.975
At least here there's no war,
famine, or global warming.

34:41.013 --> 34:42.366
Yet.

34:42.402 --> 34:44.902
JAVIER: Is this your idea of a pep talk?

34:44.940 --> 34:48.420
ROBERT: Well, if this doesn't
make you feel any better,

34:50.033 --> 34:51.572
hopefully this will.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.694
Yeah, baby.

35:01.415 --> 35:03.430
I just hope we made it in time for Marta.

35:04.613 --> 35:06.973
MIKE: RF's back up.

35:07.949 --> 35:10.431
HANA: Marta, this is Command, come in.

35:10.469 --> 35:12.010
Marta, can you hear me?

35:12.955 --> 35:15.663
AMELIE: If she's in extreme
cold, she might be unconscious.

35:15.699 --> 35:18.086
HANA: The rover's had to
have lost power by now.

35:18.122 --> 35:19.173
Hopefully the beacon's still functional.

35:19.211 --> 35:21.398
MIKE: I think it is. I've got a ping.

35:21.435 --> 35:24.292
AMELIE: Oh my God, she's in Sector 7.

35:25.774 --> 35:28.001
We'll never make it there in time.

35:49.344 --> 35:51.393
MARTA: I'm going to Mars.

35:52.008 --> 35:53.715
MAN: Is this more important than me?

35:53.751 --> 35:55.390
MARTA: This is more
important than both of us.

35:56.643 --> 35:59.803
(SPEAKING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE).

36:04.323 --> 36:05.956
MAN: Don't walk away from me like that!

36:05.993 --> 36:08.632
MARTA: Stop following me!

36:26.011 --> 36:27.573
MAN: Oh, yeah, there she is.

36:36.786 --> 36:38.346
Hey, wake up.

36:42.798 --> 36:44.048
You coming?

36:44.085 --> 36:45.890
Alright, come on.

36:45.926 --> 36:49.018
MARTA: What are, what are you doing here?

36:49.054 --> 36:52.354
KURT: We're answering an
SOS from your commander.

36:52.392 --> 36:54.557
And looking at the condition
you're in, we're going to go ahead

36:54.593 --> 36:56.703
and let that trespassing
slide, okay? So come with us.

36:56.739 --> 36:58.298
SHEP: Come on, we're going to
get you out of here, all right?

36:58.335 --> 36:59.569
KURT: No, no, no.

36:59.605 --> 37:00.695
MARTA: My samples.

37:00.733 --> 37:03.580
KURT: No, it's okay, hey, calm
down, calm down, calm down.

37:03.616 --> 37:05.041
Listen, we're going to take
them with us, all right?

37:05.077 --> 37:06.514
SHEP: We'll get you out of here.

37:06.550 --> 37:08.345
KURT: Jen, here, take the damn bins.

37:08.379 --> 37:09.385
JEN: You sure?

37:09.421 --> 37:10.671
KURT: Yes, I'm sure.

37:10.708 --> 37:14.043
I'm just not sure I
understand scientists.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.815
Here.

37:15.851 --> 37:17.380
See, we got them, you're okay.

37:17.416 --> 37:18.422
We got them.

37:18.459 --> 37:19.639
Shep, let's get her out.

37:19.675 --> 37:21.376
SHEP: Here we go.
Looks like she's fading.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.079
KURT: Get that new oxygen pack on there.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.861
SHEP: We got you.

37:24.898 --> 37:27.423
KURT: Hurry, we don't have much time!
Come on.

37:27.461 --> 37:28.780
Hey, Marta, stay with us!

37:28.816 --> 37:31.149
Stay with us!

37:35.544 --> 37:36.688
MAN: Ugh!

37:42.529 --> 37:46.525
Science is a slow, painful process.

37:46.562 --> 37:48.922
JASON: I think we need
to bring it back up.

37:48.959 --> 37:50.660
And then try to run it back down again.

37:50.697 --> 37:52.607
I think we're in a plunge pool.

37:53.043 --> 37:54.222
MAN: Ready?

37:55.517 --> 37:57.650
PARDIS: So you have to have a
certain amount of ruthlessness

37:57.675 --> 38:00.299
to just be so interested in
solving something that

38:00.324 --> 38:02.706
with all the things
pointing to you to give up,

38:02.731 --> 38:04.215
that you don't give up.

38:04.252 --> 38:06.162
JASON: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:07.018 --> 38:09.081
Things aren't going
so great for us today.

38:09.119 --> 38:10.997
We fed the cable in a couple of times,

38:11.022 --> 38:13.663
but were only able to get a couple
of meters below the water surface,

38:13.699 --> 38:16.275
so that tells us
that we're getting hung up on something.

38:17.779 --> 38:21.073
Sometimes it takes trial
after trial after trial

38:21.098 --> 38:24.721
before we finally figure out some
sort of way of snaking the cable in.

38:24.758 --> 38:29.082
I'm a little frustrated
that we're stuck. Again.

38:30.597 --> 38:33.853
In order to be a top-notch scientist,

38:33.878 --> 38:36.648
you'd have to be one of these
people who's almost immune

38:36.673 --> 38:38.033
to disappointment.

38:38.070 --> 38:41.069
You face skepticism from
the general public,

38:41.569 --> 38:44.080
and opposition from people in power.

38:44.722 --> 38:48.286
But you have to keep doing it and
keep doing it and keep doing it.

38:48.323 --> 38:49.911
JASON: It's just one of those things

38:49.936 --> 38:51.409
where you got to wake
up every morning and,

38:51.446 --> 38:54.367
you know, realize that even though
it didn't work the last 30 times,

38:54.404 --> 38:57.443
you're going to try something
new until you make it work.

38:58.327 --> 39:00.372
Sometimes the answers that we get,

39:00.397 --> 39:01.931
uh, to the questions that we're asking

39:01.956 --> 39:04.300
aren't really the ones
that society wants,

39:04.325 --> 39:07.224
but we have to keep going
out, asking questions,

39:07.261 --> 39:09.831
trying to understand
how the planet works.

39:10.636 --> 39:15.256
BILL: Science is the process
by which we know nature.

39:15.292 --> 39:18.512
It is the process by
which we learn things

39:18.537 --> 39:21.131
that control our entire existence.

39:21.926 --> 39:25.649
And most of the time, I would say
it doesn't work the way you hoped.

39:25.685 --> 39:29.646
But the more you are defeated,
the more passionate you become.

39:29.682 --> 39:32.948
And I think those are the kind
of people we want going to Mars.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.092
HANA: How is she?

39:43.130 --> 39:44.239
KURT: She's hypothermic.

39:44.277 --> 39:45.874
But she's still full of piss and vinegar.

39:45.911 --> 39:48.126
- AMELIE: Marta, are you okay?
- MARTA: I'm fine.

39:48.162 --> 39:49.975
<i>VOICE (OVER COMPUTER): Body
temperature, 29 degrees Celsius.</i>

39:50.012 --> 39:51.921
AMELIE: You're not fine,
you're severely hypothermic.

39:51.958 --> 39:54.007
<i>VOICE (OVER COMPUTER): Heartrate, 47 BPM.</i>

39:54.043 --> 39:56.961
MARTA: My samples.

39:56.999 --> 40:00.958
If there's any new microbial life,
those bastards need to stop drilling.

40:00.994 --> 40:02.789
SHEP: You're welcome.

40:02.826 --> 40:04.259
JEN: She wants you to have these.

40:04.296 --> 40:06.692
AMELIE: Bring the thermal blanket.

40:07.889 --> 40:10.141
Let's get some warmers on her core.

40:12.846 --> 40:14.165
WOMAN: Heart rate's up.

40:14.202 --> 40:15.937
No change in body temperature.

40:17.468 --> 40:19.900
AMELIE: You're lucky
there wasn't more damage.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.507
MARTA: You're mad at me.

40:22.543 --> 40:27.158
AMELIE: No, I just don't
understand you sometimes.

40:27.930 --> 40:29.786
Why would you take such a risk?

40:32.936 --> 40:34.749
Was it worth it?

40:35.299 --> 40:36.861
MARTA: Has to be.

40:36.897 --> 40:38.807
It's all I have, Amelie.

40:48.193 --> 40:50.014
AMELIE: Okay, prep the IVs.

40:50.661 --> 40:52.396
It's going to be fine.

41:28.649 --> 41:31.949
HANA: Thank you, you and your
crew, for doing what you did.

41:31.986 --> 41:33.374
You saved her life.

41:34.454 --> 41:37.197
Can I at least offer you a drink
or something to eat before you go?

41:37.234 --> 41:39.838
KURT: I thought we were banned here.

41:39.875 --> 41:41.577
HANA: Not anymore.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.710
KURT: Ah.

41:49.746 --> 41:51.534
Nice.

41:56.489 --> 41:58.189
Oh boy.

41:58.226 --> 42:01.735
You know, I have to admit that
I kind of miss this place.

42:01.771 --> 42:03.823
Lukrum has some high-end stuff,

42:03.848 --> 42:05.976
but the one thing we don't have is a bar.

42:06.012 --> 42:08.582
HANA: Well, it became essential
after living underground

42:08.618 --> 42:10.563
and in domes for years.

42:11.220 --> 42:12.905
A place where people can relax

42:12.930 --> 42:15.534
and at least feel a little
less claustrophobic.

42:16.270 --> 42:17.727
KURT: That makes sense.

42:18.072 --> 42:21.685
HANA: Anyway, here's to a fresh start.

42:22.765 --> 42:24.779
KURT: Now wouldn't that be nice.

42:24.815 --> 42:25.856
HANA: Mm.

42:25.893 --> 42:27.385
KURT: But.

42:27.421 --> 42:29.854
You need to get a grip
on your people first.

42:31.074 --> 42:32.668
HANA: Excuse me?

42:33.181 --> 42:37.152
KURT: Look, the reality is that Marta
made some choices that resulted

42:37.188 --> 42:39.133
in us getting involved.

42:39.169 --> 42:41.253
I mean, you said yourself,
we saved her life.

42:42.306 --> 42:44.151
HANA: And as I said,
we're deeply grateful.

42:45.087 --> 42:46.466
KURT: I don't need grateful.

42:47.423 --> 42:49.624
But I may need a favor at some point.

42:49.660 --> 42:51.563
Some respect in the meantime.

42:51.600 --> 42:52.688
HANA: Hm.

42:52.725 --> 42:56.059
KURT: Look, if she wanted a bag of
rocks, she could have just asked.

42:56.974 --> 42:58.422
You could have.

42:59.214 --> 43:00.890
HANA: Are you questioning my leadership?

43:01.396 --> 43:03.080
KURT: Nope.

43:03.523 --> 43:05.894
It's just an observation.

43:06.484 --> 43:08.778
You know, commander to commander.

JAVIER: Is it the baby?

43:36.125 --> 43:38.254
AMELIE: No, no, no.

43:38.290 --> 43:43.432
Uh, actually it's me.

43:43.938 --> 43:45.794
I haven't been fair to you.

43:45.832 --> 43:50.587
I, I haven't been honest about
what I was feeling before.

43:50.623 --> 43:54.286
And it's just that I was
so ready to leave, and.

43:54.324 --> 43:55.867
JAVIER: I understand.

43:57.318 --> 44:00.067
You are about to have a child
with a man you don't love.

44:00.104 --> 44:03.694
AMELIE: No, no, that's not true, Javier.

44:03.731 --> 44:06.162
I, I never said that I didn't love you.

44:06.200 --> 44:10.648
It's just that I was scared
that if I let myself love you,

44:10.673 --> 44:12.715
I wouldn't be able to leave.

44:13.632 --> 44:15.859
But I'm not leaving now.

44:16.262 --> 44:18.501
And I do love you.

44:18.537 --> 44:22.150

LESLIE: I hope you're not discouraged.

45:12.276 --> 45:15.743
The chance of a solar flare hitting
that area again is unlikely.

45:17.031 --> 45:18.966
So many elements have to align,

45:18.991 --> 45:21.015
and a confluence of
things have to happen for

45:21.052 --> 45:24.486
communications to be destroyed like
they were, and where they were.

45:25.890 --> 45:28.949
We're just really happy you're all well,

45:29.518 --> 45:31.926
and that the situation
was handled properly.

45:33.049 --> 45:34.511
Good job, Commander.

about Marta's actions,

45:40.237 --> 45:42.548
about the danger she put herself in,

45:43.349 --> 45:46.187
about the fact that she could have
got herself killed out there.

45:47.436 --> 45:50.844
HANA: No, because I think
it's punishment enough.

45:51.386 --> 45:53.296
Thank you, lieutenant.

46:05.687 --> 46:07.456
JEN: Hey.

46:07.494 --> 46:09.229
CAMERON: I didn't even hear you come in.

JEN: One of your techs
was leaving, it's okay.

46:11.561 --> 46:14.687
I'm not gonna contaminate anything.

46:20.597 --> 46:22.611
So, how much longer do you have to work?

46:22.648 --> 46:26.781
CAMERON: Uh, well I'm done, actually.

46:27.476 --> 46:30.771
How much longer can you stay?

46:31.337 --> 46:33.698
JEN: Ten minutes, maybe.

46:35.776 --> 46:38.459
CAMERON: A lot can happen in ten minutes.

46:38.497 --> 46:39.850
JEN: Yeah?

46:44.369 --> 46:49.415
CAMERON: Can you, uh, I just
need to do one thing first.

46:51.087 --> 46:53.935
Uh, comms, call Med Bay, ISO room.

46:55.087 --> 46:57.471
So I've done a quick analysis.

46:57.923 --> 46:59.348
MARTA: And?

46:59.384 --> 47:01.780
CAMERON: There are signs of life.

47:01.817 --> 47:04.422
MARTA: I knew it.

47:04.459 --> 47:07.350
CAMERON: But identical to the
strain you already discovered.

47:10.437 --> 47:12.813
I'm sorry, Marta.

47:14.052 --> 47:16.691
I know how much this all means to you.

47:17.562 --> 47:19.528
How much you've sacrificed.
