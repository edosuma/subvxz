00:03.140 --> 00:04.891
Your orders were not to engage.

00:04.892 --> 00:07.792
Your insubordination
could have cost us dearly.

00:07.811 --> 00:09.461
Troops are accounted for.

00:09.479 --> 00:11.463
Your Excellency, we should attack now.

00:11.481 --> 00:13.465
We take that bridge,

00:13.483 --> 00:15.818
you won't have to worry about
Santa Anna's reinforcements.

00:25.746 --> 00:27.413
Today, we are one.

00:27.414 --> 00:29.481
We give Texas our allegiance.

00:29.499 --> 00:31.050
We give Texas our lives.

00:31.051 --> 00:32.051
Fire cannon.

00:35.505 --> 00:36.839
Surrender, Mexican,

00:36.840 --> 00:38.507
or I'll kill you deader
than last Tuesday.

00:38.508 --> 00:39.491
Hands up.

00:41.511 --> 00:43.679
We captured Santa Anna!

00:43.680 --> 00:47.400
El Presidente, General, I cannot express

00:47.401 --> 00:49.000
how glad I am to meet you.

00:49.019 --> 00:51.002
Death by firing squad!

02:24.448 --> 02:25.998
Hey, darlin'.

02:30.761 --> 02:34.604
_

02:36.877 --> 02:38.010
You want to come up?

02:38.011 --> 02:39.861
- I'm about to.
- Uh-huh.

02:48.055 --> 02:49.722
Sam?

02:49.723 --> 02:51.573
Sam, you in there?

02:53.560 --> 02:55.410
Sam, you here?

03:01.118 --> 03:03.918
Got somebody come a long way to see you.

03:05.655 --> 03:07.373
Morning, Sam.

03:07.374 --> 03:09.542
Tom.

03:09.543 --> 03:11.711
Every shoeless shepherd,

03:11.712 --> 03:15.715
every farm boy dreaming on a haystack,

03:15.716 --> 03:19.719
even every clerk with
slicked back hair finds love,

03:19.720 --> 03:21.587
except me.

03:21.588 --> 03:23.438
Well, if it's love
you're looking for, Sam,

03:23.473 --> 03:25.440
this is hardly the place to find it.

03:25.475 --> 03:29.095
What I find here is consolation.

03:29.096 --> 03:31.946
Doc, I left a bottle of
whiskey under the bed.

03:31.982 --> 03:34.115
Would you be good enough
to fetch it for me?

03:38.855 --> 03:43.409
Mr. Secretary, I'm going
to need a hand here.

03:43.410 --> 03:44.410
All righty.

03:50.417 --> 03:52.535
Say hello to Miss Julie.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.086
- Hi, Miss Julie.
- How do?

03:54.087 --> 03:56.372
Tell Mrs. Kenworth

03:56.373 --> 03:58.707
to send up some breakfast
for General Houston.

03:58.708 --> 04:01.142
You understand me, Julie?

04:03.046 --> 04:04.812
And no more whiskey.

04:10.687 --> 04:12.555
Well, now that you're
in the recreational phase

04:12.556 --> 04:14.038
of your recovery,

04:14.057 --> 04:16.624
perhaps you can attend
to the business of Texas.

04:17.726 --> 04:20.396
The business of Texas, Tom?

04:20.397 --> 04:21.981
The battle is won.

04:21.982 --> 04:23.616
The New Orlean Greys

04:23.617 --> 04:26.668
have taken Santa Anna
to Orozimbo Plantation.

04:26.703 --> 04:27.903
They're holding him prisoner.

04:27.904 --> 04:30.573
They want to start a
war and take Mexico.

04:30.574 --> 04:33.793
We don't want another war, now, do we?

04:33.794 --> 04:37.880
What we do want is a formal
peace treaty with Mexico.

04:37.881 --> 04:39.564
That's what we need.

04:39.583 --> 04:42.984
Your enemies are conspiring
against you as we speak.

04:45.422 --> 04:46.422
Burnet?

04:46.423 --> 04:48.406
Among others.

04:48.425 --> 04:52.860
The man's as sharp as a butter knife.

04:52.896 --> 04:54.930
Sam, Texas is in a state of chaos,

04:54.931 --> 04:56.915
and you're the only man who can fix it.

04:56.933 --> 04:59.417
We're going to lose everything
we fought for if you don't.

05:00.770 --> 05:02.771
I have already lost everything.

05:02.772 --> 05:04.857
Is that so?

05:04.858 --> 05:08.694
You won Texas, and I suggest you

05:08.695 --> 05:10.746
finish up your little
party here and come with us,

05:10.747 --> 05:14.033
and we'll get back home and
fix Texas before it's too late.

05:14.034 --> 05:17.620
That cause is the
province of politicians,

05:17.621 --> 05:24.844
and I am merely a military commander.

05:26.930 --> 05:28.730
Good night, Tom.

05:28.765 --> 05:30.898
Good night, Doc.

05:30.934 --> 05:33.952
Good night, Miss Julie.

05:33.970 --> 05:36.904
What if Houston returns
in time for elections?

05:36.940 --> 05:38.807
Damn it.

05:38.808 --> 05:41.393
The man retreats to victory

05:41.394 --> 05:43.562
and then transmogrifies himself

05:43.563 --> 05:45.397
by grog house gaggle

05:45.398 --> 05:46.914
into a hero...

05:46.950 --> 05:51.036
a hero that'll sweep his
ass right into this office.

05:51.037 --> 05:53.372
That's President Jackson.

05:53.373 --> 05:57.543
He and Houston want to annex our Texas.

05:57.544 --> 06:00.546
Always been his plan to
suck Texas up in the states.

06:00.547 --> 06:02.665
We'll publicize the fact

06:02.666 --> 06:04.333
that the... the big drunk,

06:04.334 --> 06:05.933
he abandoned his post

06:05.969 --> 06:07.586
with a wound that didn't prevent him

06:07.587 --> 06:09.588
from whoring and boozing

06:09.589 --> 06:12.558
while Texas wallows in hunger and chaos.

06:12.559 --> 06:14.927
Expose his unholy affinity for savages.

06:14.928 --> 06:16.929
Yes, he's the greatest curse

06:16.930 --> 06:21.433
that Providence in all its
wrath has sent to our country.

06:21.434 --> 06:24.019
Sullied the reputation
of countless women,

06:24.020 --> 06:25.837
abandoned two wives.

06:25.855 --> 06:28.741
If the people truly knew him as we do...

06:28.742 --> 06:30.359
But they do.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.744
They don't care.

06:31.745 --> 06:35.114
No, the more men of integrity and reason

06:35.115 --> 06:37.348
that loathe Sam Houston,

06:37.367 --> 06:40.718
the more our drunken
public loves the bastard.

06:45.926 --> 06:48.526
Papa. It's the murderer.

06:49.679 --> 06:51.430
Get over here. Andale. Andale.

06:51.431 --> 06:53.632
Come on.

06:53.633 --> 06:55.817
Get him inside with Marcus.

06:59.472 --> 07:01.440
Seen a woman,

07:01.441 --> 07:03.058
lost her family to the Comanches?

07:03.059 --> 07:05.561
You know her?

07:05.562 --> 07:07.730
Mrs. Pauline Wykoff,

07:07.731 --> 07:08.814
most likely.

07:08.815 --> 07:10.882
Where might she be?

07:10.900 --> 07:13.885
Follow that road yonder about six miles.

07:13.903 --> 07:15.403
What business do you have with her?

07:15.405 --> 07:19.291
What business is that of yours?

07:19.292 --> 07:20.558
I want no trouble here.

07:20.577 --> 07:24.830
Well, then we want the same thing.

07:24.831 --> 07:26.731
I know who you are.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.335
Well, then you know to leave me be.

07:29.336 --> 07:31.486
Nueces, stay back.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.974
Yah.

07:36.426 --> 07:39.410
_

08:24.891 --> 08:27.959
Hey, what if we storm the
place from all sides...

08:27.977 --> 08:29.494
surprise them?

08:31.614 --> 08:33.532
Yeah.

08:33.533 --> 08:36.583
I couldn't sneak up on a dead mule.

08:36.619 --> 08:37.969
I best stay here.

08:39.873 --> 08:42.791
Let them keep drinking.

08:42.792 --> 08:45.176
Here's something that might work.

08:48.631 --> 08:49.597
All right.

09:03.930 --> 09:05.029
Go.

10:01.571 --> 10:03.054
Siguenme, rapido!

10:21.090 --> 10:23.107
Necesito un baño.

13:04.887 --> 13:07.422
Hey, boss!

13:12.061 --> 13:13.979
Deaf!

13:19.435 --> 13:21.903
Did you think they forgot about you?

13:22.989 --> 13:23.989
Burn it.

13:38.871 --> 13:41.456
Portilla's coming! We got to get!

13:49.882 --> 13:50.882
Whoo!

13:50.883 --> 13:51.883
We did it.

14:03.813 --> 14:05.746
- Let's go.
- I got him.

14:09.318 --> 14:10.751
Yah.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.923
Whoa.

14:19.579 --> 14:21.496
Yah! Yah!

14:32.392 --> 14:33.941
Muevense!

14:53.029 --> 14:54.962
Deaf, Colby!

15:09.762 --> 15:12.380
I wanted to do something good.

15:14.050 --> 15:18.303
Well, boy, you's done better than good.

15:18.304 --> 15:22.557
You's the one that
caught Santa Anna himself.

15:22.558 --> 15:23.991
Yep.

15:24.026 --> 15:26.877
That made my sis proud.

15:28.648 --> 15:30.998
Yeah, it did.

16:10.059 --> 16:11.708
Colby.

16:20.369 --> 16:22.236
This here is Miss Emily West.

16:22.237 --> 16:24.956
She's going to need us to
look after her for a spell.

16:24.957 --> 16:26.640
There you go, ma'am.

16:29.328 --> 16:31.412
- Papa.
- Hey, little one.

16:33.582 --> 16:36.334
She ain't the only
one needing caring for.

16:36.335 --> 16:38.251
Y'all are coming to stay with me.

16:38.253 --> 16:40.237
I just need a place to die.

16:45.060 --> 16:46.978
Howdy, y'all.

16:46.979 --> 16:49.931
Me and my partner was wondering,

16:49.932 --> 16:51.149
what do we got to do to join up

16:51.150 --> 16:52.532
with the rangering company?

16:54.436 --> 16:58.022
It's a pretty involved process.

16:58.023 --> 17:00.590
Kind of a secret, actually.

17:00.609 --> 17:02.443
Initiation? Swearing in?

17:02.444 --> 17:03.494
What?

17:03.495 --> 17:06.446
Yep, all of that.

17:06.448 --> 17:07.547
Sacred ritual.

17:09.952 --> 17:13.220
Tell you boys what.

17:13.255 --> 17:15.506
You keep riding with us,

17:15.507 --> 17:17.723
we'll see if you got what it takes.

17:21.130 --> 17:22.395
Buy y'all a drink?

17:25.384 --> 17:26.782
No.

17:42.651 --> 17:47.488
Miss Pauline! Miss Pauline!

17:47.489 --> 17:49.139
Miss Pauline!

18:10.012 --> 18:11.778
What brings you here, mister?

18:17.936 --> 18:21.939
I'm corrupted by war,

18:21.940 --> 18:26.277
unrecognizable to myself,

18:26.278 --> 18:27.328
an ugly man.

18:27.329 --> 18:29.296
She asked you a question.

18:38.507 --> 18:40.374
I feel kinship with you.

18:40.375 --> 18:42.475
You calling me ugly?

18:44.213 --> 18:45.296
No, ma'am.

18:45.297 --> 18:46.931
You're most beautiful.

18:46.932 --> 18:49.983
Now I know you're lying.

18:52.688 --> 18:57.058
In your suffering...

18:57.059 --> 19:00.611
I see love.

19:00.612 --> 19:03.281
In mine...

19:03.282 --> 19:04.381
hatred.

19:09.071 --> 19:11.471
Your pain...

19:16.161 --> 19:20.331
It draws light into the world.

19:20.332 --> 19:22.432
My pain...

19:25.587 --> 19:27.187
Repels it.

19:37.015 --> 19:38.198
Pretty words.

19:41.570 --> 19:43.020
You ain't come calling, have you?

19:43.021 --> 19:44.188
Because I ain't ready for that.

19:44.189 --> 19:45.690
No, ma'am.

19:45.691 --> 19:51.595
The only thing I have
to offer is my own dismay

19:51.613 --> 19:57.100
and an ugly, ugly, ugly history

19:57.119 --> 19:59.352
that's beyond redemption.

20:06.178 --> 20:11.299
You would allow me some solace...

20:12.351 --> 20:15.269
If you would accept this.

20:22.444 --> 20:26.364
Where did you get it?

20:26.365 --> 20:28.649
What matters now is that
it can't be returned,

20:28.650 --> 20:31.485
and I can't touch it.

20:31.486 --> 20:33.070
No, ma'am.

20:33.071 --> 20:35.540
It must be used for good.

20:35.541 --> 20:39.342
Hence, it's yours.

20:41.463 --> 20:43.179
Hope it lightens your burden.

20:47.002 --> 20:48.351
What's your name?

21:02.184 --> 21:04.117
Tom Mitchell.

21:15.530 --> 21:16.697
Well, Mr. Mitchell,

21:16.698 --> 21:19.099
I got a pot of ham
and beans on the coals.

21:25.007 --> 21:26.507
You're gonna have to clean up proper.

21:26.508 --> 21:27.607
Yes.

21:30.512 --> 21:32.597
Nate, fetch me my shears.

21:45.694 --> 21:47.494
Gracias.

21:47.529 --> 21:50.114
Al agua.

21:50.115 --> 21:53.951
You don't have nothing
we haven't seen before.

21:53.952 --> 21:56.252
Andale. Andale.

21:58.707 --> 22:00.173
Come on.

22:10.502 --> 22:12.670
I am much obliged, Mrs. Wykoff, ladies.

22:12.671 --> 22:14.672
It was a mighty fine supper.

22:14.673 --> 22:18.191
It's too late to travel, Mr. Mitchell.

22:18.226 --> 22:19.593
You can sleep in the barn.

22:19.594 --> 22:21.244
Thank you, ma'am.

22:24.232 --> 22:26.684
They may have cleaned you up...

22:26.685 --> 22:29.035
Deaf, he's our guest.

22:29.071 --> 22:32.372
I know you.

22:35.444 --> 22:39.196
Deaf, we don't treat people
like that in this house.

22:41.283 --> 22:44.418
He ain't people.

22:44.419 --> 22:46.553
I know who you are.

22:52.678 --> 22:55.562
He ain't wrong.

22:55.597 --> 22:57.548
I'm grateful for everything you've done.

22:57.549 --> 22:59.315
Mr. Mitchell, sit.

23:01.386 --> 23:04.237
Whatever happened in
the war don't matter now.

23:08.310 --> 23:09.826
We're all starting over.

23:17.285 --> 23:18.585
Thank you.

23:40.509 --> 23:42.093
Rah! Rah!

23:42.094 --> 23:45.578
- General's back.
- General's back.

23:47.315 --> 23:49.016
Welcome back, General.

23:49.017 --> 23:54.271
Men, celebrations can wait.

23:54.272 --> 23:56.206
I want the prisoners released.

23:59.444 --> 24:01.628
God damn, what is the meaning of this?

24:01.663 --> 24:04.448
The Greys say they're following
President Burnet's orders.

24:04.449 --> 24:06.059
Burnet can stick his hat up his ass

24:06.060 --> 24:07.168
and wait for the blowback.

24:07.169 --> 24:08.746
It might clear the fog in his thinking.

24:08.747 --> 24:10.763
You heard your general. Open up.

24:14.636 --> 24:18.389
Please accept my apologies,
Señor Presidente.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.689
Have them prepare a hot bath,

24:19.724 --> 24:20.841
a warm meal,

24:20.842 --> 24:22.643
and whatever medical care

24:22.644 --> 24:24.694
his Excellency may require

24:24.729 --> 24:26.764
in preparation of his journey.

24:28.567 --> 24:29.600
What journey?

24:29.601 --> 24:31.701
I have arranged an invitation

24:31.736 --> 24:33.020
for you to visit Washington.

24:33.021 --> 24:34.939
Washington?

24:39.444 --> 24:40.945
Andrew Jackson.

24:43.365 --> 24:45.048
You are truly a man of your word.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.926
Come, Almonte.

24:55.927 --> 25:00.647
Let's see where the road leads us.

25:04.803 --> 25:06.720
John Coffee Hays, General Houston.

25:06.721 --> 25:08.071
Late of Tennessee.

25:08.106 --> 25:10.558
This is my associate, Bigfoot Wallace.

25:10.559 --> 25:11.976
Sir.

25:11.977 --> 25:13.811
I knew your father well.

25:13.812 --> 25:16.079
My sympathies for your loss.

25:16.114 --> 25:18.965
Flores and Anderson tell me
you helped rescue Miss West.

25:18.984 --> 25:20.367
Well done.

25:20.368 --> 25:21.986
Your father would have been proud.

25:21.987 --> 25:23.803
- Karnes.
- Sir.

25:23.822 --> 25:26.323
I'm going to St. Augustine
with Secretary Rusk.

25:26.324 --> 25:28.542
I want you and the Rangers
to deliver El Presidente

25:28.543 --> 25:31.462
to General Gaines at the border.

25:31.463 --> 25:32.812
I'll meet up with you after.

25:35.717 --> 25:38.052
Boys, get some grub inside you.

25:38.053 --> 25:39.637
We've got a new mission.

25:39.638 --> 25:41.988
We're taking Santa
Anna to the U.S. border.

25:57.522 --> 25:58.906
It's warm.

26:03.078 --> 26:05.362
Here.

26:05.363 --> 26:07.865
Mrs. Wykoff.

26:07.866 --> 26:09.932
I have some business with you today.

26:13.538 --> 26:14.804
And I with you.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.625
Payment in full.

26:17.626 --> 26:19.376
I'll have that deed.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.865
10% was due August 1st.

26:25.884 --> 26:27.434
It is now September.

26:27.435 --> 26:29.652
I have foreclosed.

26:31.556 --> 26:32.940
We planted late 'cause of the war,

26:32.941 --> 26:34.441
just like everybody else.

26:34.442 --> 26:36.777
The war has no bearing on the terms.

26:36.778 --> 26:39.829
By law, you must vacate immediately.

26:53.912 --> 26:56.012
I can pay in full.

26:58.717 --> 27:01.418
I undersold.

27:01.419 --> 27:04.070
I am housing a sick ranger.

27:04.089 --> 27:05.589
You should have thought of that

27:05.590 --> 27:08.509
before you insulted me
at my place of business.

27:08.510 --> 27:09.742
Your land is now forfeit,

27:09.761 --> 27:11.061
as well as the collateral with it.

27:11.062 --> 27:12.513
Collateral? What collateral?

27:12.514 --> 27:13.863
Your slave.

27:13.898 --> 27:15.432
Recollect your husband
had no cash to put down.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.768
You can't have Nate.

27:17.769 --> 27:20.169
He's free.

27:22.490 --> 27:24.024
I done freed him.

27:24.025 --> 27:25.859
Ah.

27:25.860 --> 27:27.695
Weren't the case when your husband

27:27.696 --> 27:29.697
assigned him to me.

27:29.698 --> 27:31.665
My husband, Deaf Smith,
is a ranger and...

27:31.666 --> 27:32.666
Your husband is a lunger!

27:34.119 --> 27:36.787
A goner.

27:36.788 --> 27:39.105
He ain't gonna do shit.

27:41.760 --> 27:45.512
What about this one?

27:45.513 --> 27:47.480
- What about her?
- I'm no slave.

27:50.301 --> 27:51.435
But I'll work for you.

27:51.436 --> 27:52.603
Emily.

27:52.604 --> 27:55.955
The money and my employ for one year,

27:55.974 --> 27:57.608
and then the debt is clear.

27:57.609 --> 28:00.394
Indentured servitude.

28:00.395 --> 28:02.563
Two years with a contract,

28:02.564 --> 28:04.815
all legal like.

28:04.816 --> 28:09.319
I hold the deed until
she completes her service.

28:21.800 --> 28:26.319
I am constantly amazed by
the depths of the human heart.

28:33.845 --> 28:34.994
Get on.

28:41.019 --> 28:42.019
Huh!

28:57.873 --> 28:59.839
Sir.

28:59.875 --> 29:01.125
Sir, sir, they took her.

29:01.126 --> 29:02.342
They done took her.

29:02.377 --> 29:03.893
They done took her. They took her.

29:24.766 --> 29:26.366
May I?

29:39.781 --> 29:41.097
My daughter's.

29:44.369 --> 29:47.053
She and my boy and my wife...

29:49.708 --> 29:52.359
They were slaughtered
right before my eyes.

29:57.182 --> 30:03.570
I answered with a
storm of fire and blood.

30:05.941 --> 30:07.824
I became death.

30:16.068 --> 30:20.336
Buckley deserves killing
like few other men, ma'am.

30:22.374 --> 30:26.160
Romans 12:19.

30:26.161 --> 30:28.162
"Beloved, never avenge yourselves,

30:28.163 --> 30:31.716
"but leave it to the wrath of God.

30:31.717 --> 30:34.001
For it is written"...

30:34.002 --> 30:38.271
"'Vengeance is mine, ' saith the Lord."

30:39.174 --> 30:40.356
Amen.

30:46.014 --> 30:48.364
There are other ways to help Emily.

30:51.820 --> 30:55.088
And you, sir, are
more than welcome here.

30:58.694 --> 31:01.961
You have any idea

31:01.997 --> 31:05.032
what a man must endure

31:05.033 --> 31:06.883
who lives such a life?

31:09.421 --> 31:11.805
No, you cannot.

31:13.875 --> 31:18.713
No man can...

31:18.714 --> 31:20.530
unless he lives it himself.

31:24.269 --> 31:27.138
I want to pay for my sins,

31:27.139 --> 31:29.940
and I will.

31:34.229 --> 31:36.212
But until Judgment Day...

31:41.370 --> 31:48.007
I will not harm another living soul.

32:03.425 --> 32:05.426
I'll watch over Emily.

32:24.329 --> 32:27.832
Miss Pauline, have I done you wrong?

32:27.833 --> 32:29.333
Goodness gracious, no.

32:29.334 --> 32:31.502
Then why'd you free me?

32:31.503 --> 32:32.953
Where I gonna go?

32:32.954 --> 32:34.205
Where I go to, Miss Pauline?

32:34.206 --> 32:36.356
You can stay with me, like always.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.393
All right.

32:40.429 --> 32:41.846
You're still my slave,

32:41.847 --> 32:42.963
but it's our little secret.

32:42.964 --> 32:46.149
Oh, thank you, Miss Pauline.

32:47.803 --> 32:49.019
Clear the road, boys.

32:49.020 --> 32:52.121
President Jackson's waiting.

32:52.140 --> 32:56.777
Been thinking it's high time
to find me a nice, plump woman,

32:56.778 --> 32:58.461
and I mean real plump.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.079
I'm 25 years old.

33:00.115 --> 33:01.232
I got to...

33:01.233 --> 33:02.749
Comanches.

33:03.785 --> 33:05.035
Take cover!

33:10.792 --> 33:11.758
Watch out!

33:15.964 --> 33:17.214
Gator, no!

33:33.515 --> 33:35.099
Stop!

33:35.100 --> 33:37.401
- Portilla, stop.
- We need to parlay.

33:37.402 --> 33:40.771
Cease fire.

33:40.772 --> 33:43.107
I don't need anyone to rescue me.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.276
I'm going to the White House.

33:45.277 --> 33:47.293
Get out, all of you.

33:47.329 --> 33:48.678
Go!

33:48.697 --> 33:50.030
Now.

33:50.031 --> 33:51.665
Muy bien, su excelencia.

33:51.666 --> 33:53.450
Come usted dice.

33:53.451 --> 33:55.202
Vamanos.

34:12.053 --> 34:14.103
That's his son.

34:33.074 --> 34:34.992
- He's gone.
- It's Beans.

34:34.993 --> 34:36.391
He said it'd be Comanches.

34:49.925 --> 34:51.074
Help me with him.

35:26.261 --> 35:28.433
_

35:28.702 --> 35:29.628
_

35:29.920 --> 35:32.355
_

35:32.754 --> 35:35.159
_

35:35.504 --> 35:36.616
_

35:37.479 --> 35:39.158
_

35:45.113 --> 35:46.913
Ah!

35:53.989 --> 35:55.805
What's Beans' real name?

35:55.824 --> 35:58.242
It's Lloyd or Leonard.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.994
Heard somebody say it once.

35:59.995 --> 36:04.832
Name was George or Josiah or Jeremiah.

36:04.833 --> 36:09.253
No, no, no, Maurice or Bene... Benedict?

36:09.254 --> 36:12.339
I hate to say it, gentlemen,

36:12.340 --> 36:15.225
but it must've been
something prissy, right?

36:15.226 --> 36:18.429
Because... I mean, like,
Archibald or Percy or something,

36:18.430 --> 36:22.182
because otherwise, why... why
wouldn't he use his own name?

36:22.183 --> 36:24.985
A man needs his Christian
name on his grave marker.

36:24.986 --> 36:26.335
- Yeah.
- Yes, he does.

36:26.354 --> 36:27.821
Yes, sir.

36:27.822 --> 36:31.241
Well, he'll always be Beans to me.

36:31.242 --> 36:32.959
- Beans it is.
- Beans, Beans.

36:32.994 --> 36:35.079
- Yeah, Beans.
- Beans.

37:10.602 --> 37:11.951
No, no, no, no, no.

37:27.703 --> 37:29.704
Mm-hmm.

37:40.682 --> 37:41.513
Such a waste.

37:41.514 --> 37:44.599
You won't lie on your
back rather than break it.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.601
It's not like spreading your legs

37:46.602 --> 37:49.571
is a trade unknown to you.

37:49.572 --> 37:53.942
I have informed Clarence
to spare you the whip.

37:53.943 --> 37:55.676
Not one scar.

37:55.695 --> 37:57.261
You'll break soon enough.

38:01.951 --> 38:03.535
Men'll line up out the door

38:03.536 --> 38:06.137
to bed the mistress of Santa Anna.

38:14.130 --> 38:16.431
I'm looking for work.

38:16.432 --> 38:17.481
I can keep books.

38:17.517 --> 38:19.551
I used to clerk.

38:19.552 --> 38:22.771
I'm willing to do almost anything.

38:22.772 --> 38:24.890
You look familiar.

38:24.891 --> 38:26.157
Do I know you?

38:28.978 --> 38:31.045
No, I don't recollect.

38:31.064 --> 38:33.532
The name's Tom Mitchell.

38:35.118 --> 38:37.051
I need some help with
these big doings today.

38:37.070 --> 38:39.905
I suppose I could trust you tending bar.

38:39.906 --> 38:43.575
You short me so much as a nickel,

38:43.576 --> 38:45.410
and I'll hack off your hand.

38:46.412 --> 38:47.595
Inside.

38:50.083 --> 38:52.918
You do not at any time
lighten her burden.

38:52.919 --> 38:54.852
Understood?

39:00.059 --> 39:01.192
Vamos.

39:08.101 --> 39:10.152
Here we are.

39:10.153 --> 39:12.419
There it is. There.

39:12.438 --> 39:14.135
You, in the kitchen.

39:14.136 --> 39:15.186
Shoo, shoo.

39:15.187 --> 39:16.471
In the kitchen.

39:16.472 --> 39:17.904
Santa Anna's whore

39:17.940 --> 39:20.558
doesn't eat with decent folk.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.777
Whoo! It's the Rangers!

39:43.549 --> 39:47.385
God bless you all, and God bless Texas.

39:47.386 --> 39:48.970
God bless Texas.

39:53.008 --> 39:56.576
- God bless Texas!
- Welcome, Mr. Houston!

39:58.847 --> 40:03.184
Hey, Vern, thought
you'd be in Paris by now.

40:03.185 --> 40:05.418
Just saying my bon voyages.

40:15.497 --> 40:18.583
Yes, sir!

40:18.584 --> 40:20.918
Gonna be a place in
heaven for you, boys.

40:33.549 --> 40:36.434
We just can't turn our backs
soon enough on this place.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.485
Few more supplies, and we'll vamoose.

40:47.229 --> 40:48.396
Rebecca.

40:48.397 --> 40:49.963
Kit.

40:51.900 --> 40:55.236
Guess it's now or never.

40:55.237 --> 40:57.905
Got this metal off a dead Mexican

40:57.906 --> 40:59.306
who tried to gut me.

41:01.994 --> 41:04.161
Melted it down to this.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.261
Kit.

41:08.250 --> 41:11.469
I was hoping I wasn't gonna see you.

41:11.470 --> 41:14.070
And what am I supposed to do?

41:15.924 --> 41:17.357
When I came to after San Jacinto,

41:17.392 --> 41:20.511
it was your face I'd seen first.

41:20.512 --> 41:23.264
Right then, I knew.

41:23.265 --> 41:24.265
I love you, Rebecca,

41:24.266 --> 41:26.032
and I know you love me.

41:29.271 --> 41:30.438
If my word's good for anything,

41:30.439 --> 41:33.540
I got to get on this wagon.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.210
The hell you do.

41:37.246 --> 41:38.529
You know, I'm sorry for that fella.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.430
I am.

41:40.449 --> 41:41.949
But there ain't no denying

41:41.950 --> 41:44.017
that you and I were
meant to be together.

41:46.922 --> 41:48.388
Oh, Kit.

41:51.126 --> 41:52.225
Who the hell is this?

41:54.296 --> 41:55.546
This is Kit.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.098
He fished me and Colby out of the river

41:57.099 --> 41:59.350
after we separated from you.

41:59.351 --> 42:01.519
Well, I'm obliged to you, certainly,

42:01.520 --> 42:03.471
but you got any further
business with my fiancée?

42:03.472 --> 42:04.972
Gavin, I...

42:04.973 --> 42:08.575
With due regard, mister,
I love this woman.

42:08.610 --> 42:11.244
She loves me.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.980
And I'll take one hell
of an ass whooping,

42:12.981 --> 42:15.399
won't lift a hand.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.417
But she ain't getting on this wagon.

42:18.620 --> 42:19.904
Is that true?

42:19.905 --> 42:21.004
You love him?

42:24.543 --> 42:27.310
I do.

42:27.329 --> 42:29.262
With all my heart.

42:42.010 --> 42:44.979
Well, no point in taking up with a woman

42:44.980 --> 42:46.946
whose heart belongs to another.

42:50.185 --> 42:52.987
Gavin, I never meant to hurt you.

42:52.988 --> 42:54.954
I'd be lying if I said you didn't.

42:57.943 --> 42:59.860
I made her father a promise.

42:59.861 --> 43:01.245
"Take good care of her."

43:01.246 --> 43:03.847
Requiring the same from you.

43:03.865 --> 43:06.299
Iffen you don't, I'll come back.

43:06.335 --> 43:08.218
I'll settle up with you.

43:32.894 --> 43:33.993
Yah!

43:41.119 --> 43:43.052
Whoo!

43:43.071 --> 43:44.822
You need to stack these up here.

43:54.416 --> 43:55.833
Come on in.

44:42.297 --> 44:46.133
25 and 26...

44:46.134 --> 44:47.384
Excuse me.

44:47.385 --> 44:48.853
- Empresario Buckley.
- Excuse me.

44:48.854 --> 44:50.453
You son of a bitch.

44:53.965 --> 44:56.386
You were ordered by
Texas to burn this town.

44:56.387 --> 44:58.575
Failure to comply, that's treason.

44:58.576 --> 45:00.961
I'll answer to that in court!

45:00.962 --> 45:04.965
You are in court, sir...
a military tribunal.

45:04.966 --> 45:06.566
You have been convicted.

45:06.584 --> 45:08.252
You remember how this goes.

45:08.253 --> 45:11.104
Not a lot of ply between
catching and hanging.

45:14.926 --> 45:17.360
What do you want?

45:17.395 --> 45:19.579
Retribution.

45:19.597 --> 45:24.268
You will give your hotel
and saloon to Miss Emily West

45:24.269 --> 45:27.271
in recognition of her heroic sacrifice

45:27.272 --> 45:29.273
in capturing the tyrant Santa Anna

45:29.274 --> 45:32.192
and liberating Texas.

45:32.193 --> 45:35.378
That's as it should be!

45:35.413 --> 45:37.197
A welcomed gesture.

45:37.198 --> 45:38.198
It's hers.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.933
- Oh.
- Yeah.

45:40.952 --> 45:43.102
And the Wykoff place.

45:43.121 --> 45:44.955
Yes.

45:44.956 --> 45:47.940
And the deed to the Wykoff
place, free and clear,

45:47.959 --> 45:50.594
all monies returned.

45:50.595 --> 45:52.278
- Done.
- Whoo!

45:52.297 --> 45:54.447
Yeah, that's right. Whoo!

45:54.466 --> 45:57.384
The age of the empresario
ended at San Jacinto.

45:57.385 --> 45:59.470
There's a new law in this land.

45:59.471 --> 46:03.289
Your crimes, sir, will not
escape the noose a second time.

46:05.193 --> 46:06.576
Court adjourned.

46:09.314 --> 46:11.565
Men are thirsty after
all this fuss, General.

46:11.566 --> 46:14.401
What say you, Mr. Buckley?

46:14.402 --> 46:15.953
Drinks on the house?

46:15.954 --> 46:17.988
Yes, yes.

46:17.989 --> 46:19.490
For the love of all things holy, yes.

46:23.294 --> 46:26.296
Strike up the band. Play us a tune.

46:29.384 --> 46:31.168
Nicely done, Sam.

46:53.828 --> 46:55.612
I've seen land along the Colorado

46:55.613 --> 46:59.249
I think would suit us
right down to the ground.

46:59.250 --> 47:01.869
Hill country... white, limestone bluffs,

47:01.870 --> 47:03.519
crystal springs.

47:03.538 --> 47:06.889
Buffalo walk up, lick the
salt right out of your hand.

47:09.794 --> 47:11.644
My God, you're beautiful.

47:17.719 --> 47:21.320
You've got Texas to worry about.

47:21.356 --> 47:23.322
Me?

47:23.358 --> 47:26.393
I'm gonna make something
out of this here hotel.

47:26.394 --> 47:28.612
Sell the hotel, woman.

47:28.613 --> 47:30.413
I'm not letting you go again.

47:32.617 --> 47:34.717
I'm asking you to be my wife.

47:38.907 --> 47:41.390
You can't have me for your wife

47:41.409 --> 47:43.509
and your political
career at the same time.

47:43.545 --> 47:45.329
- Says who?
- People won't abide it.

47:45.330 --> 47:47.247
People be damned.

47:47.248 --> 47:49.583
We can do as we please.

47:49.584 --> 47:51.418
I've sacrificed enough for Texas.

47:51.419 --> 47:52.852
Haven't you?

47:55.256 --> 47:56.590
Sam.

47:59.344 --> 48:03.680
You know, you're... you're
destined for great things.

48:11.272 --> 48:13.774
What are you saying?

48:13.775 --> 48:18.427
I'm always gonna be
here for you, forever.

48:18.446 --> 48:20.497
Right here, by your side.

48:55.783 --> 48:57.401
The war secretary himself,

48:57.402 --> 49:00.370
he said, "You never seen such a hero."

49:00.371 --> 49:01.655
- Whoa.
- This... this right here?

49:01.656 --> 49:03.574
This is for uncalled valor.

49:03.575 --> 49:05.576
You know what that is, valor?

49:05.577 --> 49:06.577
That means I...

49:14.836 --> 49:16.386
Hey, get out.

49:16.387 --> 49:18.487
Get that... hey, look
where you're going.

49:18.506 --> 49:20.757
Oh, my Mexican chili sitter

49:20.758 --> 49:25.562
and his lying, swamp
rat amigo, how are you?

49:25.563 --> 49:27.514
Why don't you just walk
away there, traitor?

49:27.515 --> 49:29.733
Vern loves making trouble.

49:29.734 --> 49:30.934
Vern, hey, that's enough.

49:30.935 --> 49:33.687
Kit, my boy, how are you?

49:33.688 --> 49:36.356
Well, we're all met except
the big, fat, Indian man.

49:36.357 --> 49:37.623
Where is he at?

49:37.659 --> 49:39.291
Anderson lost his son.

49:39.327 --> 49:40.944
Drifted away.

49:40.945 --> 49:42.696
Beans was killed too.

49:44.999 --> 49:47.284
Beans?

49:47.285 --> 49:48.634
Yeah.

49:53.374 --> 49:54.758
Damn.

50:00.298 --> 50:02.716
It's a good thing I quit.

50:05.019 --> 50:06.535
Come to me. Come to me, girl.

50:06.554 --> 50:08.388
Come to me, girl. Come on.

50:08.389 --> 50:09.723
No, you get away from me. No.

50:09.724 --> 50:11.084
Let's dance. Come on, let's dance.

50:12.894 --> 50:15.278
Let go of her.

50:15.279 --> 50:17.481
Unhand my daughter, you
drunken son of a bitch.

50:17.482 --> 50:18.649
Papa.

50:18.650 --> 50:20.984
Gonna want to cock that gun, sawbones.

50:20.985 --> 50:21.985
Go to hell.

50:24.572 --> 50:25.721
Rebecca?

50:25.740 --> 50:27.006
Rebecca!

50:28.459 --> 50:29.910
Becca.

50:29.911 --> 50:31.343
Doc!

50:35.967 --> 50:38.802
Doc.

50:38.803 --> 50:41.838
My darling Becca, she's gone.

50:45.426 --> 50:47.644
Becca.

51:02.356 --> 51:04.641
Y'all hear about that demon named Lorca?

51:04.642 --> 51:07.082
Rode in on a wave of brimstone.

51:07.083 --> 51:08.451
Yeah.

51:08.452 --> 51:11.803
I hear he gutted over 100 Mexicans,

51:11.838 --> 51:14.206
slit them open, and
fed them their own bile.

51:14.207 --> 51:15.807
That's right.

51:15.842 --> 51:18.844
A ghost rider who kills in
the name of Satan hisself.

51:18.845 --> 51:21.263
They say you look him
straight in the eye,

51:21.264 --> 51:23.799
he'd turn you to stone.

51:23.800 --> 51:25.280
That is the truth, right there.

51:25.281 --> 51:27.566
And the... and the Lord himself knows...

51:27.567 --> 51:30.986
tell you something, gentleman.

51:30.987 --> 51:34.372
I am the onliest one here who ever, ever

51:34.373 --> 51:38.493
looked Lorca square in the eye

51:38.494 --> 51:41.329
and did not turn to stone.

51:43.249 --> 51:44.666
I swear.

51:44.667 --> 51:47.552
Another round up there.

51:47.553 --> 51:51.438
How about a toast to the onliest one...

51:51.474 --> 51:53.341
the onliest one... hey,
hold your glasses still.

51:53.342 --> 51:56.511
Hold your glasses still.

51:56.512 --> 52:00.098
Beer. Cold as you have it.

52:00.099 --> 52:01.999
Y'all know there's a goat tending bar?

52:12.245 --> 52:13.912
Haven't we had the occasion?

52:13.913 --> 52:16.380
No, sir.

52:18.534 --> 52:23.354
Tom Mitchell, late of Missouri.

52:28.094 --> 52:30.477
It's a pleasure to meet you, Tom.

52:41.057 --> 52:42.489
We're good.

52:46.395 --> 52:48.063
Good luck.

53:15.925 --> 53:18.075
Elena.

53:20.479 --> 53:23.598
He said he'd sooner crawl
into a rattlesnake den

53:23.599 --> 53:26.583
than see you.

53:26.602 --> 53:27.986
But I know better.

53:27.987 --> 53:29.620
I can't say I blame him.

54:01.220 --> 54:05.023
Them quacks in New Orleans

54:05.024 --> 54:07.407
didn't saw your damn leg off?

54:10.479 --> 54:13.865
They damn sure tried to.

54:13.866 --> 54:17.584
You know, I sent Lupe and Elena away,

54:17.620 --> 54:20.587
and I hold you in far less regard

54:20.623 --> 54:22.589
than I hold them.

54:22.625 --> 54:25.877
I hope so.

54:25.878 --> 54:28.213
Of course, you'll be in worse company

54:28.214 --> 54:30.314
if I leave you here by yourself.

54:33.335 --> 54:35.152
Says you.

54:39.175 --> 54:41.241
Sit down, you ornery bastard.

54:51.404 --> 54:55.023
You know what the best part of dying is?

54:55.024 --> 54:58.410
I don't gots to be listening
to your bullshit no more.

55:02.198 --> 55:03.948
Charmaine.

55:07.036 --> 55:10.220
I reckon I'll be riding her again soon.

55:13.509 --> 55:15.976
Don't worry, Sam.

55:16.011 --> 55:18.930
It ain't time for no funeral yet.

55:53.249 --> 55:55.583
Erastus "Deaf" Smith

55:55.584 --> 56:01.089
was Texas' first and greatest ranger.

56:01.090 --> 56:04.575
A man more brave and honest never lived.

56:04.593 --> 56:08.263
He set the mark and
standard for all to follow.

56:08.264 --> 56:12.249
I never had a better friend.

56:12.268 --> 56:14.368
He was my stay in darkest hour.

56:17.106 --> 56:20.424
We'll never see his like again.

56:20.442 --> 56:25.045
So it is with somber hearts

56:25.080 --> 56:26.998
we come to pay our last respects,

56:26.999 --> 56:31.018
Deaf, dearest brother.

56:32.288 --> 56:36.106
May the Great Spirit
give light to your path

56:36.125 --> 56:42.229
and clouds of sorrow never
rest upon your journey.

56:57.980 --> 57:01.149
Good night, sweet prince.

57:01.150 --> 57:04.235
May flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest.

57:15.464 --> 57:17.314
Deaf made this.

57:19.168 --> 57:21.836
I think he'd want you to have it.

58:07.780 --> 58:09.614
Anderson, glad you're back.

58:09.615 --> 58:10.714
Yeah.

58:13.952 --> 58:14.952
What's this?

58:14.953 --> 58:17.038
Go clean yourself up.

58:17.039 --> 58:18.956
Sam, uh...

58:18.957 --> 58:21.092
Ah, hell, I know this is the
wrong time to bring this up,

58:21.093 --> 58:23.878
but the election is just 12 days away.

58:23.879 --> 58:25.880
Leaders with vision are few.

58:25.881 --> 58:27.882
Texas needs you as its president.

58:27.883 --> 58:30.101
You're right.

58:30.102 --> 58:32.687
It is the wrong time.

58:32.688 --> 58:35.238
Besides, I'm voting for Stephen Austin.

58:41.030 --> 58:42.746
Get on the side.

58:42.781 --> 58:44.581
I got the load on the line.

58:44.616 --> 58:45.582
Got it?

58:49.154 --> 58:50.822
Little bit down on the right.

58:55.878 --> 59:01.749
Of course, prudence dictated
that I not intervene in Texas.

59:01.750 --> 59:04.886
Of course not.

59:04.887 --> 59:06.838
Interesting.

59:06.839 --> 59:11.509
The newly elected president
of Texas is Sam Houston,

59:11.510 --> 59:14.679
an officer in your
command in the Creek War,

59:14.680 --> 59:17.014
a congressman in your political party,

59:17.015 --> 59:20.685
governor of your home state.

59:20.686 --> 59:24.238
An independent spirit?

59:24.239 --> 59:28.458
Best to view the situation as it is now.

59:28.494 --> 59:31.579
In the interest of a peaceful solution,

59:31.580 --> 59:33.129
do you think the Mexican Congress

59:33.165 --> 59:36.701
will cede Texas for
a fair consideration?

59:36.702 --> 59:38.703
And by Texas, I mean all the land

59:38.704 --> 59:42.924
between the Sabine and the Pacific.

59:42.925 --> 59:45.877
I very much like your house.

59:45.878 --> 59:47.595
It would suit me.

59:47.596 --> 59:50.480
I admire your candor,

59:50.516 --> 59:52.767
since you came here in chains.

59:52.768 --> 59:55.720
A blunder, certainly.

59:55.721 --> 59:58.038
Do I come as your prisoner?

59:58.056 --> 01:00:00.141
No.

01:00:00.142 --> 01:00:04.145
I am welcomed as a head of state.

01:00:04.146 --> 01:00:06.213
Forgive my presumption.

01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:09.650
The news hasn't reached you as of yet.

01:00:09.651 --> 01:00:12.870
You're no longer president of Mexico.

01:00:12.871 --> 01:00:17.742
Your vice president has replaced you.

01:00:17.743 --> 01:00:22.130
This is only formality until my return.

01:00:22.131 --> 01:00:25.883
Regardless, you cannot have Texas,

01:00:25.884 --> 01:00:27.851
much less California,

01:00:27.886 --> 01:00:31.855
without provoking all of Europe
into a war you can never win.

01:00:33.842 --> 01:00:35.843
The next time we dine, sir,

01:00:35.844 --> 01:00:39.096
you may find yourself
a guest at my table,

01:00:39.097 --> 01:00:42.082
the Napoleon of the West.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.819
Indeed.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:49.539
Did not Napoleon succumb
to the Duke of Wellington?

01:00:49.575 --> 01:00:52.759
And what bearing does that have?

01:00:52.778 --> 01:00:55.629
I crushed Wellington's
troops at New Orleans.

01:00:57.783 --> 01:01:00.884
Should my country face
a foreign threat, sir,

01:01:00.919 --> 01:01:03.553
I, myself, will answer.

01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:05.673
Salud.

01:01:05.674 --> 01:01:07.758
To peace between our nations.

01:01:29.198 --> 01:01:31.511

01:01:31.927 --> 01:01:33.822

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:10.913
_

01:02:40.018 --> 01:02:42.053
Knowles.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.645
Lester Davis, I knew I'd see you again,

01:02:55.646 --> 01:02:59.482
you lying, cheating,
thieving son of a bitch.

01:02:59.483 --> 01:03:01.569
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:03.037
I'd lower that iron, mister,

01:03:03.038 --> 01:03:05.003
before I shave your
throat for Saint Peter.

01:03:05.004 --> 01:03:06.736
I'm in the right.

01:03:06.755 --> 01:03:08.422
This here drifter's
a common horse thief.

01:03:08.423 --> 01:03:09.724
You mistake him for someone else.

01:03:09.725 --> 01:03:10.325
Not hardly.

01:03:10.326 --> 01:03:12.643
He's wanted all over
the Louisiana Territory.

01:03:12.644 --> 01:03:13.777
That true?

01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:19.734
Your name Buckens?

01:03:19.735 --> 01:03:20.818
Perkins.

01:03:20.819 --> 01:03:22.987
Timothy Perkins.

01:03:22.988 --> 01:03:24.704
Baton Rouge.

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.857
Baton Rouge.

01:03:26.858 --> 01:03:28.591
The spotted gelding.

01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:30.494
The horse ain't the problem.

01:03:30.495 --> 01:03:32.879
It's that damn forged bank
draft you bought him with.

01:03:36.034 --> 01:03:38.885
Leave him be. He's in the right.

01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:43.189
My poker winnings.

01:03:46.128 --> 01:03:48.713
This ain't nowhere near enough.

01:03:48.714 --> 01:03:50.613
I'll send the rest
as soon as I get paid.

01:03:50.632 --> 01:03:52.133
I'm... I'm rangering now.

01:03:52.134 --> 01:03:54.067
Like hell you will.

01:04:04.646 --> 01:04:05.813
Who's Maybelline?

01:04:05.814 --> 01:04:06.913
My mother.

01:04:08.617 --> 01:04:10.917
I'm owed $300.

01:04:10.952 --> 01:04:12.418
Do I have to call the law on your ass?

01:04:12.454 --> 01:04:14.655
You know you got a price on your head.

01:04:14.656 --> 01:04:17.625
We're the law in Texas.

01:04:17.626 --> 01:04:20.477
All I see is a bunch of damn gun thugs.

01:04:24.132 --> 01:04:26.149
I once got a little
loose with the surveys

01:04:26.168 --> 01:04:29.769
in an Arkansas land scheme myself.

01:04:31.973 --> 01:04:33.072
It's silver.

01:04:36.178 --> 01:04:39.013
My horse belonged to a man in Veracruz,

01:04:39.014 --> 01:04:43.449
but I look better on it than he did.

01:04:43.485 --> 01:04:45.686
Did you know that you
can get court-martialed

01:04:45.687 --> 01:04:48.606
and shot for looting?

01:04:48.607 --> 01:04:50.256
We all make mistakes.

01:05:02.421 --> 01:05:04.637
Let me just make sure
I got this straight.

01:05:04.673 --> 01:05:06.590
You bastards...

01:05:06.591 --> 01:05:11.811
you have the gall to ride
me like a common criminal.

01:05:11.847 --> 01:05:13.813
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:15.466
Just want to be sure.

01:05:15.467 --> 01:05:17.601
Because you're still
just ten pounds of shit

01:05:17.602 --> 01:05:19.202
in a five-pound sack, Knowles.

01:05:20.605 --> 01:05:22.773
Well, y'all are right about that.

01:05:22.774 --> 01:05:24.642
That is true.

01:05:24.643 --> 01:05:27.945
No slack whatsoever. I see.

01:05:27.946 --> 01:05:29.212
Matter settled?

01:05:32.818 --> 01:05:34.568
I reckon so.

01:05:34.569 --> 01:05:38.122
Well, good.

01:05:38.123 --> 01:05:39.657
And that's all she wrote.

01:05:39.658 --> 01:05:40.958
Well said, Captain.

01:05:40.959 --> 01:05:43.461
Well, we ain't no altar boys.

01:05:43.462 --> 01:05:45.845
- No, we ain't.
- Texas don't need them.

01:05:45.881 --> 01:05:48.132
It's what we do from now on that counts.

01:05:48.133 --> 01:05:51.919
Now I know I can count
on all you miscreants,

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.004
except Knowles, of course.

01:05:54.005 --> 01:05:56.090
I'd say it's lucky we
didn't rob that bank.

01:05:56.091 --> 01:05:57.190
What bank?

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:12.434
Well, I'm calling you.

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:13.935
Yep.

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:15.319
All right.

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:20.824
Flush.

01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:27.381
I'll have that wrist cuff.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.235
It was stolen from a friend of mine.

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.821
Actually, I beg to differ.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:35.839
I took it off some chicken
ruffian down Velasco way.

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:40.462
Cut you for it.

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:42.247
Put up.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.231
No time for faint hearts.

01:06:59.732 --> 01:07:01.532
It weren't meant to be.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:13.460
Boy.

01:07:16.749 --> 01:07:18.966
Hear tell you rode with Deaf Smith.

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:28.793
All right.

01:07:28.794 --> 01:07:30.778
Deal another hand.

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.658
Just looking for a warm fire,

01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:03.560
maybe a good, strong drink.

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:18.859
Ain't nothing like a strong drink.

01:08:31.857 --> 01:08:33.241
Mr. Tom Mitchell.

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:34.859
Thank you, Anna.

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:37.529
Where have you been hiding?

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:39.613
I'm fixing a dish

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:42.951
for the Sunday supper
at the church social.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.518
If I didn't know any better,

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:46.203
I'd swear you didn't
care for my cooking.

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:47.372
No. No.

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:48.590
I'd fight the devil himself

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:51.341
for a bowl of your Irish stew.

01:08:51.343 --> 01:08:52.809
Have a good day.

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:06.307
Who wants licorice?

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:07.475
Me!

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:11.279
Oh. All right. All right.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:12.996
Here you are.

01:09:13.032 --> 01:09:15.783
All right.

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:17.318
- Gracias.
- You kids like licorice.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.553
Hey, make sure he gets some.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:23.741
No. No thanks.

01:09:23.742 --> 01:09:25.008
- Hello, Father.
- Hola.

01:09:25.044 --> 01:09:26.593
- Really nice.
- Gracias.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.731
Mmm.

01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:31.883
Can I have some? Thank you.

01:09:31.884 --> 01:09:33.301
Mm-hmm.

01:09:33.301 --> 01:09:34.919
- Smells great.
- Go enjoy yourself.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.638
I will.

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:38.256
I'm gonna take some bread here.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.644
Back for seconds if there's more.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.370
Nueces, no. Give me the gun.

01:09:53.404 --> 01:09:54.755
- Give me the gun.
- Tom.

01:09:54.773 --> 01:09:57.609
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:09:59.945 --> 01:10:02.664
Hey, let him go.

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:05.299
Let the boy be. Let the boy be.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:09.954
I make...

01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:12.006
I make no claims against him.

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:19.813
Come here. Come here.

01:10:20.933 --> 01:10:22.566
Come here.

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:40.300
I understand.

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:45.540
Entiendo.

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:48.826
Entiendo.

01:11:28.803 --> 01:11:29.970
_

01:11:30.604 --> 01:11:31.914
_

01:11:34.264 --> 01:11:36.552
_

01:11:37.399 --> 01:11:38.704
_

01:11:39.202 --> 01:11:40.663
_

01:11:45.153 --> 01:11:47.771
My fellow Texans,

01:11:47.772 --> 01:11:49.072
at this moment,

01:11:49.073 --> 01:11:51.491
I can't repress the emotion of my heart

01:11:51.492 --> 01:11:54.778
or restrain the feeling
which my sense of obligation

01:11:54.779 --> 01:11:57.497
to my fellow citizens has inspired.

01:11:57.498 --> 01:12:02.335
We are only in the outset
in the campaign of liberty.

01:12:02.336 --> 01:12:04.220
The future is locked up,

01:12:04.255 --> 01:12:08.842
the destiny which awaits our people.

01:12:08.843 --> 01:12:15.799
Now it becomes my duty to make
presentation of this sword,

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.553
this emblem of my past office.

01:12:19.554 --> 01:12:21.471
I have worn it with
some humble pretensions

01:12:21.472 --> 01:12:24.406
in defense of my country.

01:12:24.442 --> 01:12:28.311
Should danger again call,
I expect to resume it,

01:12:28.312 --> 01:12:33.150
and I will respond to that
call with my blood and my life.

01:12:36.521 --> 01:12:39.739
I lost.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:42.474
So if they want my head,

01:12:42.493 --> 01:12:44.044
let them have it.

01:13:00.511 --> 01:13:03.495
God bless Texas.

01:13:03.514 --> 01:13:05.265
God bless you all.

01:13:20.364 --> 01:13:24.201
Do not get used to home life, Almonte.

01:13:24.202 --> 01:13:28.922
Within a year, we will be
cockfighting in Texas again.

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.130
_

01:13:43.426 --> 01:13:44.948
_

01:13:45.906 --> 01:13:49.145
_

01:13:49.905 --> 01:13:50.991
_

01:13:51.474 --> 01:13:52.738
_

01:13:53.132 --> 01:13:53.862
_

01:13:54.025 --> 01:13:55.688
_

01:14:00.121 --> 01:14:02.038
Miss Peggy, thank you.

01:14:02.039 --> 01:14:04.457
My dear.

01:14:04.458 --> 01:14:07.460
I want to thank you,
David, for the publicity.

01:14:07.461 --> 01:14:10.176
People offer me free
drinks and fresh eggs

01:14:10.177 --> 01:14:12.512
everywhere I go now.

01:14:12.513 --> 01:14:14.830
What is it about you, Sam?

01:14:14.849 --> 01:14:17.666
What spell do you hold over Texas?

01:14:20.988 --> 01:14:24.607
Maybe it's because everybody
here is just like me.

01:14:24.608 --> 01:14:26.693
They see me rise in spite of my flaws,

01:14:26.694 --> 01:14:28.627
and they know they can too.

01:14:31.582 --> 01:14:34.200
It's not me they celebrate, David.

01:14:34.201 --> 01:14:35.952
It's hope.

01:14:39.924 --> 01:14:43.543
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Houston.

01:14:43.544 --> 01:14:46.195
- Houston.
- Sam Houston.

01:14:46.213 --> 01:14:47.196
Good-bye, everybody.

01:14:48.516 --> 01:14:50.600
God bless Texas!

01:14:50.601 --> 01:14:52.484
God bless Texas.

01:16:09.763 --> 01:16:10.763
Hang on! Hang on!

01:16:22.026 --> 01:16:25.945
