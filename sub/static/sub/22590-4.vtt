00:10.303 --> 00:11.721
Gotham Park Racetrack. . .

00:11.888 --> 00:15.391
<i>...the day before the Bruce Wayne Foundation
Memorial Handicap...</i>

00:15.808 --> 00:18.311
<i>...where two fancy fillies
are meeting the press:</i>

00:18.478 --> 00:23.024
<i>A high-spirited horse
and her proud-spirited mistress.</i>

00:23.191 --> 00:25.568
Can you say "cheese," baby?
- it's not "baby."

00:25.735 --> 00:26.819
It's Lola Lasagne.

00:26.986 --> 00:30.907
- Senora Lola Lasagne.
-Can you get that nag to crack a smile?

00:31.074 --> 00:35.495
If you're referring to my prize-winning filly with
that wonderful white stripe on her forehead...

00:35.662 --> 00:38.039
...she'd much rather be called Parasol.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.416
A most appropriate name, I believe.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.836
Haven't you got the corner
on the world's supply of shower sticks?

00:44.003 --> 00:47.382
Shower sticks? You must mean
my famous collection of parasols.

00:47.549 --> 00:49.300
Hold this.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.013
Priceless, you know.

00:55.682 --> 00:57.225
Shape up, Parasol.

00:57.392 --> 01:00.103
Looks and your legs are all we've got left.

01:02.021 --> 01:05.358
<i>NARRATOR". But what's this strange bird
doing in the royal surroundings...</i>

01:05.525 --> 01:09.028
...of a <i>queen of the turf
and the sport of kings?</i>

01:12.865 --> 01:14.367
You waddling bird.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.955
Ah...

02:55.385 --> 02:56.511
What is this?

02:56.678 --> 02:58.179
You can't just barge in here...

02:58.346 --> 03:01.140
...cut open a locked case,
and walk off with a priceless folio...

03:01.307 --> 03:03.184
...of famous parasols.
-Why not?

03:03.351 --> 03:05.144
Among other things, it's a felony.

03:05.311 --> 03:08.856
Faugh, I'm a tax-paying citizen
and this is a public library.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.526
That shouldn't have been locked
in the first place.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.403
I'm gonna call the police.

03:13.778 --> 03:16.864
- Your beloved father, I presume?
-Exactly.

03:18.491 --> 03:21.160
Stay where you are.
I'm putting you under citizen's arrest.

03:21.327 --> 03:23.705
A tax-paying citizen's arrest, I hope.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.581
Dad, Barbara.

03:25.748 --> 03:28.626
The Penguin just waddled in here,
cut open a locked case...

03:28.793 --> 03:30.837
...and tried to waddle off with--

03:32.422 --> 03:34.298
Just a minute.

03:42.682 --> 03:46.561
He's gone. But he left an umbrella
in the umbrella stand and it's...

03:47.145 --> 03:50.356
Ticking? Ticking?

03:50.523 --> 03:52.608
The umbrella handle is ticking.

03:52.775 --> 03:55.069
Holy time bomb.
Lucky we happened to be here.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.405
Boy Wonder,
you took the words out of me mouth.

03:57.572 --> 03:59.532
Tell her not to remove the umbrella.

03:59.699 --> 04:04.162
Penguin will want to escape alive, which
should give us time to get there. Come, Robin.

04:04.704 --> 04:08.374
Batman and Robin are on their way now,
Barbara. You better leave there quickly.

04:08.541 --> 04:10.168
Leave the library?

04:10.334 --> 04:14.255
Dad, I'm not going to let a ticking
umbrella handle frighten me off my job.

04:14.422 --> 04:18.968
If you say so, but don't touch that umbrella.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.720
Brazen bird.

04:20.887 --> 04:23.055
I'll wager there's a connection
between this...

04:23.222 --> 04:26.809
...and that parasol he stole from Lola Lasagne
today at the racetrack.

04:26.976 --> 04:30.730
You wager, Chief O'Hara?

04:30.897 --> 04:34.233
A public servant
and upstanding chief of police betting?

04:34.400 --> 04:37.528
Uh, can I call it a hunch, commissioner?

04:37.695 --> 04:43.743
Well, with the Dynamic Duo on our side,
I think "hunch" is most appropriate.

04:48.456 --> 04:52.752
Haven't you some Anti-Percussion Asbestos
Bat-flax in your utility belt?

04:52.919 --> 04:54.253
No time for that now, Robin.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.839
Let's get this offending article
out into the corridor...

04:57.006 --> 04:59.967
...and under the Bat-bomb Machine.

05:18.778 --> 05:21.864
No need for concern, Miss Gordon.
Just a practical joke.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.991
Well, some practical joke.

05:25.701 --> 05:28.704
The umbrella handle was loaded
with explosives.

05:30.122 --> 05:32.667
And you say Penguin left it
in the umbrella stand...

05:32.834 --> 05:36.295
...because you prevented his stealing
a priceless folio from a locked case?

05:36.462 --> 05:38.172
Yes, of famous parasols.

05:38.339 --> 05:42.385
Ah. Hardly a reason for an attempt
on your life, Miss Gordon.

05:42.802 --> 05:46.222
You may remember he once tried
to force me to marry him.

05:46.389 --> 05:47.431
- Ah...
- Gosh, yes.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.809
But thanks to Batgirl,
that wedding never took place.

05:49.976 --> 05:52.728
Yes, thanks to Batgirl. Hm.

05:52.895 --> 05:56.190
And I can understand a man like Penguin
harboring jealousy and revenge...

05:56.357 --> 06:00.111
...but murder and locked cases...

06:00.278 --> 06:03.114
...priceless parasols, famous folios...

06:03.281 --> 06:06.534
- Wanna give the Batcomputer a crack at it?
- Good idea, Robin.

06:09.620 --> 06:12.832
<i>NARRATOR".
While in Penguin's Bookshop...</i>

06:12.999 --> 06:18.045
<i>...or to be more accurate,
Penguin's bookmaking shop...</i>

06:20.423 --> 06:22.592
Penguin's Bookshop.

06:22.842 --> 06:27.054
Yeah, Apricot Soup in the sixth at Pimlico.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.265
Ten grand on the nose.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.017
You got it, Frankie.

06:32.894 --> 06:35.187
- Ten grand for Frankie.
-Right, Penguin.

06:39.483 --> 06:40.693
Ha-ha.

06:40.860 --> 06:45.448
I received a note.
I might find my priceless stolen parasol here.

06:45.615 --> 06:47.617
It's not as priceless as all that.

06:47.783 --> 06:51.454
A little research has proved to me
that it is a fake.

06:51.621 --> 06:54.540
Just as you are a fake, Lulu Schultz.

06:54.707 --> 06:57.293
And I didn't need any research
to prove that. Ha-ha!

06:57.460 --> 06:59.170
- Lulu Schultz?
-Mm.

06:59.337 --> 07:01.380
I am Senora Lola Lasagne.

07:01.547 --> 07:03.007
Horse feathers, Lulu.

07:03.174 --> 07:04.508
I knew you back when.

07:04.675 --> 07:08.137
I knew you when you'd steal the braces
from other kids' teeth.

07:08.304 --> 07:10.890
- While you stole their teeth.
-Ha!

07:11.057 --> 07:13.559
But you're still very clever, Pengy.

07:13.726 --> 07:16.103
I thought I had the whole world fooled.

07:16.270 --> 07:19.607
Now, now, what about the other Parasol,
the four-legged one?

07:19.774 --> 07:22.109
Is that also a fake?

07:22.276 --> 07:25.196
Do you mean my prize-winning filly
with the white stripe...

07:25.363 --> 07:27.073
...in the middle of her forehead?
-Eh.

07:27.239 --> 07:31.327
That's the only thing I have to show for my
three weeks of marriage to Luigi Lasagne.

07:31.494 --> 07:34.580
What?
The billionaire South American playboy?

07:34.747 --> 07:38.042
Not exactly a playboy, Pengy.

07:38.209 --> 07:41.045
- Luigi's almost 80.
-Oh...

07:41.212 --> 07:46.425
Instead of dying, as any adoring young wife
might reasonably expect...

07:46.592 --> 07:48.135
...he divorced me.
-Ah.

07:48.302 --> 07:51.681
Can you imagine?
He thought I was after his money.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.933
Ooh, what slander. Faugh.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.686
And that stingy old judge.

07:56.852 --> 07:59.730
- All he gave me was one horse.
-Ew.

07:59.897 --> 08:03.693
Yes. Why, I even had to sell
my real priceless collection of parasols...

08:03.859 --> 08:06.946
...for eating money.
-Mm-mm.

08:07.113 --> 08:12.910
But if my horse, Parasol, should win
the Bruce Wayne Handicap tomorrow...

08:13.077 --> 08:14.286
...think of the purse.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.288
What purse? It's an empty purse.

08:16.455 --> 08:21.127
All the proceeds in that race
go to the Bruce Wayne Memorial Foundation.

08:22.003 --> 08:25.297
I think we've given
the Batcomputer sufficient time...

08:25.464 --> 08:27.633
...and a thorough enough dusting, Alfred.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.595
It must have heard you.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.765
"Umbrella, parasol.

08:34.932 --> 08:39.270
A sunshade coming under the general category
of covering, such as veiling, curtaining...

08:39.437 --> 08:41.147
...blanketing--"
-Blanketing.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.984
Blanketing.
That may be the clue we've been looking for.

08:45.151 --> 08:47.111
Wet blanket. Blanket of snow.

08:47.278 --> 08:49.488
Or perhaps something
in the bedding department.

08:49.989 --> 08:51.490
An eiderdown or counterpane.

08:51.657 --> 08:55.453
No, I doubt it very much, Alfred.
Blanket, blanket...

08:55.745 --> 08:57.663
Wet blanket.

08:57.997 --> 08:59.582
Blanket of snow.

08:59.749 --> 09:01.751
Plaid blanket. Horse--

09:01.917 --> 09:03.210
Horse blanket.

09:03.377 --> 09:07.423
Of course, Parasol is the name of a horse
entered in the Bruce Wayne Handicap...

09:07.590 --> 09:10.134
...by Senora Lola Lasagne.

09:12.845 --> 09:15.347
Look, the Bat-correction Signal.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.933
"Lulu Schultz."

09:18.100 --> 09:20.019
Lola Lasagne must be a pseudonym.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.646
- That's a sticky one.
-Sticky.

09:22.813 --> 09:24.982
Paste, mucilage, glue--

09:25.149 --> 09:26.192
Gluten.

09:28.319 --> 09:29.445
Another card.

09:31.489 --> 09:33.532
"Glu Gluten's Glue Factory."

09:33.699 --> 09:36.577
We start outwith parasols
and come up with a glue factory.

09:36.744 --> 09:39.497
- Holy non sequiturs.
-I don't think so, Robin.

09:39.663 --> 09:43.834
We all know that we're dealing
with a devious bird of prey in the Penguin.

09:44.001 --> 09:48.923
And we certainly know, sir, that the
Batcomputer is above any practical joke.

09:49.090 --> 09:50.382
So?

09:50.549 --> 09:52.551
So now that night has fallen...

09:52.718 --> 09:56.430
...I propose that we pay an unexpected visit
to Glu Gluten's Glue Factory.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.140
Remain alert, Alfred.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.434
Who knows what trouble we may run into?
Robin.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.561
You can depend on me, sir.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.465
- Hello?
<i>- Miss</i> Gordon?

10:31.632 --> 10:32.925
Oh, hello.

10:33.259 --> 10:39.431
I've just heard that Batman and Robin
have taken off for Glu Gluten's Glue Factory...

10:39.598 --> 10:41.642
...on an errand of deep mystery.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.854
<i>- I thought you might be interested.
- Well, yes,</i> I <i>am.</i>

10:45.020 --> 10:46.438
But how did you hear of it'?

10:46.981 --> 10:49.441
Erm, actually, I overheard it.

10:49.608 --> 10:53.821
The Dynamic Duo were to be dinner guests
at stately Wayne Manor tonight.

10:53.988 --> 10:55.531
Now, their tricky mission...

10:55.698 --> 10:58.284
<i>-...could concern you, Miss Gordon.</i>
- Me?

10:58.450 --> 11:01.495
Yes. It seems that, uh, Penguin...

11:01.662 --> 11:06.792
...his exploding umbrella
and a rare book on parasols are involved.

11:07.543 --> 11:10.462
Thank you. I appreciate the tip, Alfred.

11:10.629 --> 11:13.632
And, as always, your secrecy.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.432
Charlie, I thought I was going to spend
a quiet evening with you.

11:21.599 --> 11:24.351
Instead, I'm off to Glu Gluten's Glue Factory.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.738
<i>NARRATOR". Once more, from Barbara Gordon,
librarian and police commissioner's daughter...</i>

11:35.905 --> 11:41.118
<i>...to that dominoed daredoll Batgirl
in a matter of seconds.</i>

11:47.833 --> 11:51.462
Well, so I'll give up the purse.
I can still keep the cash.

11:51.629 --> 11:53.839
- Parasol would win as the favorite.
-Yes...

11:54.006 --> 11:57.343
...but favorites just pay peanuts.
You know that, Lulu.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.886
Oh, wait a minute.

11:59.053 --> 12:02.514
What if Parasol wasn't the favorite?

12:02.681 --> 12:03.682
Wasn't?

12:03.849 --> 12:07.853
Yes, what if we had another horse
that looked like Parasol...

12:08.020 --> 12:09.855
...and we put him in the same race?

12:10.022 --> 12:14.902
And then took my horse
and a dab of paint and a new name...

12:16.862 --> 12:19.531
We're working on the same wicked wavelength,
huh, Lulu?

12:19.698 --> 12:20.950
Here, hold that a minute.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.204
- What's that?
-It is a radio.

12:25.371 --> 12:28.582
I did a little research at the library
and left a souvenir.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.668
I wanna see if it's exploded yet. Ha!

12:30.834 --> 12:32.211
- Exploded?
-Yeah.

12:32.378 --> 12:35.130
You're still up to your naughty little tricks,
aren't you?

12:35.297 --> 12:37.091
That's right. Come on, come on.

12:37.258 --> 12:40.344
<i>And thus the Dynamic Duo
really earned their name this afternoon...</i>

12:40.511 --> 12:44.598
<i>...when they successfully detonated a bomb
ingeniously planted in an umbrella handle...</i>

12:44.765 --> 12:46.892
...at <i>the Gotham Library.
And now for the--</i>

12:47.059 --> 12:48.519
The dynamic dunderheads.

12:48.978 --> 12:53.107
Faugh. Double faugh. Triple faugh.

12:53.274 --> 12:55.609
Why are you so anxious
to bomb the library?

12:55.776 --> 12:58.404
No, not the library,
somebody in the library.

12:58.570 --> 13:03.242
Somebody who had the miserable taste
to turn down an offer of marriage from me.

13:03.409 --> 13:06.787
You, Pengy, scorned by a woman?

13:06.954 --> 13:08.539
-It's incredible, isn't it?
-Yes.

13:08.706 --> 13:11.083
Well, let's get back to the horse-switching.

13:11.250 --> 13:14.878
Before those caped crumbums
get on my tailpiece again.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.131
Hey, you feathered finks, let's go.

13:22.678 --> 13:27.308
<i>NARRATOR". But even as the Dynamic Duo
head for their dubious destination...</i>

13:28.100 --> 13:33.147
<i>...and Batgirl zooms through the night
for her own surprise appearance...</i>

13:33.939 --> 13:40.487
...in <i>Glu Gluten's Glue Factory,
Penguin and Lola are completing</i> a <i>deal.</i>

13:40.654 --> 13:42.197
<i>Or trying to.</i>

13:43.449 --> 13:45.868
You're out of print, buddy.
Dead as a dodo.

13:46.035 --> 13:49.163
- The parade has passed you by.
-Faugh.

13:49.330 --> 13:52.458
Look, glue isn't made out of horses' hoofs
anymore, you know.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.877
- Then what's that horse doing here?
-Horse?

13:55.044 --> 13:58.047
Yes, this four-legged thing with a long nose.

13:58.213 --> 14:02.634
Oh, this horse. Well, you see, I always keep
a spare one here just in case of an emergency.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.011
Well, We'd like to buy it.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.014
If you're not gonna use it for glue,
how about making a deal?

14:07.181 --> 14:08.766
- What's the deal?
-The usual.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.435
Nothing down and a little a week.

14:11.602 --> 14:14.021
Nothing down?
What kind of a deal is that?

14:14.188 --> 14:15.981
Why, you're out of print, buddy.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.317
Dead as a dodo.
The parade has passed you by.

14:18.484 --> 14:21.487
Don't you know anything
about the economic structure of this country?

14:21.653 --> 14:25.157
It's always nothing down and a little a week.
That is the cornerstone...

14:25.324 --> 14:26.867
...of our financial security.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.411
- How little a week?
-Which week?

14:29.578 --> 14:31.955
They're making a deal
in a glue factory for a horse.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.665
Mm. What can we do?

14:33.832 --> 14:36.835
What's illegal about buying a horse
in a glue factory?

14:37.002 --> 14:39.505
Something, all right,
or Penguin wouldn't be in on it.

14:39.671 --> 14:43.675
But planting a time bomb in a public library
is a felony.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.595
Come on. Let's nail him.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.860
Drat. Double drat. Triple drat.

15:02.027 --> 15:05.030
- Expletives will get you nowhere.
-Except back in the cooler.

15:05.197 --> 15:08.367
The cooler? Because I was conducting
a little private business?

15:08.534 --> 15:11.662
No, because you've been misconducting
some public business.

15:11.829 --> 15:13.622
Like bombing libraries.

15:13.789 --> 15:16.208
Faugh, that was a whimsical prank.

15:16.375 --> 15:20.129
What other whimsical pranks are you
and your charming conspiratress up to?

15:20.295 --> 15:22.714
You do have a way with words, Batman.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.550
They wanna buy a horse.

15:24.716 --> 15:29.054
Senora Lola Lasagne,
the owner of that fine filly, Parasol?

15:29.221 --> 15:30.931
- Well, you see, I--
-Cool it, Lulu.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.892
Now, grab that nag
and paint a stripe on his forehead...

15:34.059 --> 15:37.896
...and make the switch at the track.
I'll meet you back at the bookshop.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.898
Hey, I ain't got a deal.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.108
A deal?

15:41.275 --> 15:43.026
You've got a full house.

15:43.193 --> 15:47.114
Armband, Visor, you other finks, attack!

16:34.203 --> 16:36.038
Batman!

16:36.622 --> 16:38.373
Batman!

16:39.541 --> 16:40.959
Batman!

16:41.627 --> 16:42.836
Batman!

16:53.388 --> 16:55.224
Come along, little Pengy.

16:55.974 --> 16:59.686
Faugh, struck out by Batgirl.

18:07.004 --> 18:09.590
- Good show.
-Gosh, Batman, they sure hit the tape.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.925
They certainly did, old chum.

18:12.467 --> 18:15.387
We usually don't need help
with our fights, Batgirl.

18:15.554 --> 18:18.307
But this time your presence
is certainly appreciated.

18:18.473 --> 18:21.977
Oh, thank you.
I couldn't ask for a greater compliment.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.812
Oh, but the Penguin got away.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.147
I'm sorry.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.525
We'll get him back.

18:28.692 --> 18:30.027
I certainly hope so.

18:30.193 --> 18:34.114
I pray for the day when Gotham City's safe
from such mocking mountebanks.

18:51.632 --> 18:55.636
Cleaning up crime is the dream
of every good citizen, Batgirl.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.139
But one thought intrigues me.

18:59.556 --> 19:03.518
How did you know Robin and I might be
in trouble with Penguin in this glue factory?

19:04.436 --> 19:08.857
Through the one thing you couldn't possibly
have in your utility belt, Batman.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.609
A woman's intuition.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.790
What are we gonna do about these goons?

19:24.956 --> 19:27.084
I'd say their fate is sealed, Robin.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.002
At least for the present.

19:29.169 --> 19:32.964
Perhaps we should offer Batgirl
a ride back to the ci--

19:33.965 --> 19:35.425
She's gone.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.594
Like a shadow.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.763
Like smoke.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.640
Like a shooting star.

19:41.807 --> 19:44.810
Who knows where she goes?
Who knows where she comes from?

19:44.976 --> 19:47.521
Who knows who she is?

19:47.688 --> 19:49.856
- Let's try to catch her.
-No, Robin.

19:50.023 --> 19:55.821
We must allow her her anonymity
and freedom of action as we demand ours.

19:55.987 --> 20:01.201
Whatever is fair in love and war
is also fair in crime-fighting.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.620
And there's something...

20:03.787 --> 20:08.166
Something very sinister
about Penguin and Lulu Schultz...

20:08.333 --> 20:11.169
...trying to find another horse
the same color as Parasol.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.130
To the Batcave.

20:19.678 --> 20:23.014
Nothing down, nothing a week.

20:23.181 --> 20:24.683
A nothing factory.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.351
What a deal.

20:28.603 --> 20:29.688
Courage, Robin.

20:29.855 --> 20:32.190
We'll get that slippery bird.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.452
Holy mucilage.

20:43.618 --> 20:48.749
Yes, Robin, things are getting even stickier.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.469
You pulled it off, Lulu.

21:00.635 --> 21:05.891
You switched bangtails at the track,
and this hay burner is the real palooka.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.477
The real Parasol, Pengy.

21:08.643 --> 21:13.231
And I wish you wouldn't call her a bangtail,
a hay burner or a palooka.

21:13.398 --> 21:17.736
And the refugee from the glue factory
is in Parasol's stall, right?

21:17.903 --> 21:22.282
With a beautiful white stripe
right down the middle of her forehead.

21:22.449 --> 21:27.662
I combined my pancake makeup,
my eye shadow, my eyebrow pencil...

21:27.829 --> 21:31.625
...my lipstick, my nail polish
and some elbow grease.

21:31.792 --> 21:34.461
Let's hope the elbow grease
is the right color. Ha-ha!

21:34.628 --> 21:36.922
- Nobody got wise?
-Of course not.

21:37.088 --> 21:40.467
After all, I am Senora Lola Lasagne.

21:40.634 --> 21:42.636
Besides, nobody saw me.

21:42.803 --> 21:47.557
That's right. Yes, yes, you're the great horse.
We're gonna give you a nice new paint job...

21:47.724 --> 21:50.727
...and give you a nice name.
What about Bumbershoot, huh?

21:50.894 --> 21:54.064
You'll be the most famous
and richest long shot in history.

21:54.231 --> 21:56.483
- Ha!
-Just one thing worries me, Pengy.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.777
How is our long shot
gonna pay a big price...

21:58.944 --> 22:02.113
...if everybody bets on the other horse
they think is Parasol?

22:02.280 --> 22:05.742
Because all our money
will be on Bumbershoot.

22:05.909 --> 22:06.952
What money?

22:07.118 --> 22:09.830
Well, let's say Bumbershoot
pays 100-to-1

22:09.996 --> 22:12.874
...that means
we'll make $200 for a $2 ticket.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.669
- But that takes $2.
-Yes, Lulu.

22:15.836 --> 22:18.797
And we should have $10,000
down on Bumbershoot.

22:18.964 --> 22:21.800
- That's a nice round figure.
-But where's it all coming from?

22:21.967 --> 22:25.387
Don't you have any old family heirlooms
you can pawn?

22:25.554 --> 22:30.225
I told you, Pengy,
my old family heirloom divorced me.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.645
That's right. And you've sold
all your priceless parasols, hm?

22:33.812 --> 22:35.814
They weren't as priceless as I thought.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.816
Priceless parasols.

22:37.983 --> 22:41.486
What about a priceless folio
of famous parasols?

22:41.653 --> 22:42.779
Yeah, what about it?

22:42.946 --> 22:45.115
There's one at the library.

22:45.282 --> 22:49.160
If it's that priceless, I can get
a good price for it on the black market.

22:49.327 --> 22:52.539
Ha-ha.
And after all, you are in the book business.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.416
Well, sort of.

22:54.583 --> 22:55.750
Pengy...

22:56.960 --> 22:58.587
...you're a genius.
-Yes.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.088
Go get it, right now.

23:00.255 --> 23:02.048
No, no. The library isn't open yet.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.092
Since when has that ever stopped you?

23:04.259 --> 23:07.888
That's right, it never has and it never will.
I'll go there right now.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.764
You go and paint up Bumbershoot...

23:09.931 --> 23:15.979
...and I'll go and try to snatch
a folio of famous, priceless parasols.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.318
<i>NARRATOR".
Is Lola right?</i>

23:21.484 --> 23:24.821
<i>Can't Penguin be stopped?</i>

23:28.867 --> 23:33.038
<i>Is he really stealing a priceless folio
to finance his crooked coup...</i>

23:33.204 --> 23:38.126
<i>...with the Dynamic Duo pasted
to the Batmobile outside the glue factory?</i>

23:38.460 --> 23:41.379
<i>And Barbara Gordon,
minus Batgirl's trappings...</i>

23:41.546 --> 23:43.214
<i>...asleep in her apartment?</i>

23:43.381 --> 23:44.841
<i>Or is she?</i>

24:04.444 --> 24:08.239
Dad, Barbara. I'm sorry to be calling you
so early in the morning...

24:08.406 --> 24:12.535
...but the Emergency Library Prowler Signal
just rang.

24:12.702 --> 24:14.537
I'm sorry we worried you, Alfred.

24:14.704 --> 24:18.249
But even the Batmobile's Library Paste
Bat-dissolving Switch got stuck.

24:19.626 --> 24:22.170
Look, Batman, the red phone.

24:24.214 --> 24:26.383
<i>NARRATOR".
But are they all too late?</i>

24:26.549 --> 24:33.139
<i>Will Penguin and Lola succeed in pulling off
the foulest race-fixing scheme of all time?</i>

24:33.682 --> 24:37.727
<i>For more, tune in the next episode.</i>
