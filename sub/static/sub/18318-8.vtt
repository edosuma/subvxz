00:21.822 --> 00:23.090
Yow!

00:23.091 --> 00:26.226
Oh, my God.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.461
Whew. Oh, Jesus.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.963
Do you even have a license?

00:30.964 --> 00:32.799
Why, I have an English one.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.933
Uh, does that count?

00:33.934 --> 00:35.103
Apparently not.

00:37.438 --> 00:40.107
Listen.
Now we have the chance.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.574
Shall we just blow out of here

00:41.575 --> 00:42.975
and go to Sag Harbor
for the weekend?

00:42.976 --> 00:44.544
You don't want to meet them.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.778
Of course I do.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.380
I'm thrilled.
I'm delighted.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.549
No, no. I mean, you know,
kids and parents.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.983
I mean,

00:50.984 --> 00:52.852
it's always a bit
tricky introducing...

00:52.853 --> 00:54.687
It's too late now.
They've seen us.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.423
Hi. Hi. Thomas,

00:56.424 --> 00:59.126
I... You... I want you
to be yourself,

00:59.127 --> 01:00.860
and I want you to have
fun and...

01:00.861 --> 01:02.262
But, you know,
sometimes these...

01:02.263 --> 01:03.663
They can be a little...
And you can...

01:03.664 --> 01:05.397
And you... you know what?
Never mind.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.135
It's fine. Let's go in.
It's fine.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.537
Welcome, welcome.

01:10.538 --> 01:11.439
Hi.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.506
Glo, bring your tuchus
over here.

01:13.507 --> 01:16.143
You heard her, Glo. Get
your tuchus over there.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.010
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.012
- How are you?
- Hi, Mom. Hi.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.148
Nice to see you.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.215
- Hi, darling.
- Both of you,

01:22.216 --> 01:23.616
This is Thomas Pembridge.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.785
- How do you do?
- Oh, you must
be very special.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.221
She never brings any
of her boyfriends home.

01:28.222 --> 01:31.224
Well, she has horrible
taste in men.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.625
You said it.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.161
Oh, he's fun.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.229
And this was at the prom.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.998
Oh. Never seen so much hair.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.567
And her date. My God.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.569
Looks like a porcupine
with acne.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.572
Well, actually, he now
runs a tech company

01:45.573 --> 01:47.174
worth 7 billion.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.041
Hmm. Oh, my Lord.

01:49.042 --> 01:51.244
Who's this little butterball?

01:51.245 --> 01:52.745
Well, that's Glo at age 12.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.982
We used to call her
Princess Twinkie.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.317
Oh.

01:57.318 --> 02:00.253
You don't say.
Well, hello, Princess Twinkie.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.255
All right. That's enough.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.191
I was a very heavy little girl.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.826
I promised myself I was
going to lose 40 pounds

02:06.827 --> 02:09.729
and move somewhere
with a library

02:09.729 --> 02:12.232
just as soon as
I possibly could.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.700
I think we hit a nerve.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.535
She always thought
she was too good for us.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.670
Yeah. And, you know,
I'm always trying

02:17.671 --> 02:20.207
- to get her to lighten up.
- That... That's not true.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.209
- It's not false.
- Mom,

02:22.210 --> 02:24.811
I got the strudel cake
you like in the kitchen.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.481
So listen, kid,

02:28.482 --> 02:30.751
what are your intentions
for our daughter?

02:32.753 --> 02:34.754
Oh, well, not marriage.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.023
Do you think I want
to be number 5?

02:37.024 --> 02:38.958
So that's it, honey.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.328
No grandchildren.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.630
Y...

02:43.631 --> 02:45.097
Ha!

02:45.098 --> 02:46.533
- Oh, you!
- Look at his face!

02:46.534 --> 02:48.435
He believe we were going
to give him the third degree.

02:48.436 --> 02:49.802
- You got me.
- Really?

02:49.803 --> 02:50.870
That's a good one.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.305
What's so funny?

02:52.306 --> 02:54.307
Your parents are
being abusive to me.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.408
I love them.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.876
They're fantastic.

02:56.877 --> 03:00.313
Well, I'm glad everyone's
getting along so well.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.482
Come here.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.952
Bye. Bye, Glo.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.554
- Wow.
- Bye.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.622
I think that went splendidly.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.558
Oh, I'm glad
you had so much fun.

03:11.559 --> 03:12.959
Well, you would, too,
if you removed

03:12.960 --> 03:15.127
that lumpy piece of stick
from up your ass.

03:15.128 --> 03:18.431
I will, and then I will
hit you over the head with it.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.467
Oh, ho ho.
That's the spirit.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.269
Listen, we have to go
to your place tonight.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.670
I've got a lodger.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.872
I think I'd just like
to take a night to myself.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.040
Oh, well, I mean, what
the hell did I say?

03:28.041 --> 03:30.410
Oh. You know, I...

03:30.411 --> 03:32.580
I don't know
what I was thinking.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.750
4 in the morning,
and you still can't sleep.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.287
Maybe a little music will help.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.323
John Sebastian,

03:43.324 --> 03:44.491
hey, keep on playing,

03:44.492 --> 03:45.825
but don't play for me

03:45.826 --> 03:46.926
because I'm home.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.027
I'm fine, okay?

03:48.028 --> 03:49.529
I don't... You know?

03:49.530 --> 03:53.700
A man without a house
who says he's home.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.303
A man who goes to prison
and says he's free.

03:56.304 --> 04:00.139
Is he a child,
a genius, or a madman?

04:00.140 --> 04:01.474
Shut up, John Sebastian!

04:01.475 --> 04:04.777
Whoa. Who... What...
What's all the noise for?

04:04.778 --> 04:06.313
Sorry, sorry, Maestro.
Sorry. I...

04:06.314 --> 04:07.547
What are you throwing?

04:07.548 --> 04:08.748
It's just...
It's John Sebastian...

04:08.749 --> 04:10.450
Oh, my God, you're
doing the bubbles

04:10.451 --> 04:11.851
- in the house again.
- I have to.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.620
There's something I'm
trying to figure out,

04:13.621 --> 04:14.987
but I can't until I sleep,

04:14.988 --> 04:16.956
and I can't sleep until
I can figure it out.

04:16.957 --> 04:20.959
Because I saw Melody Yang
to an amazing bubble,

04:20.961 --> 04:23.162
a big one, and then a little one

04:23.163 --> 04:24.464
that goes inside that bubble,

04:24.465 --> 04:27.166
and then another one

04:27.167 --> 04:28.401
which circled around the bubble.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.669
You know, I...

04:29.670 --> 04:31.371
I've been wanting
to tell you something.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.772
Yes, tell me, tell me.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.807
Well, it's about Gloria and me.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.644
I... I just don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.346
At the beginning
of this thing, it was...

04:39.347 --> 04:41.348
She was so much fun, you know.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.950
We had a wonderful time
together, and it...

04:43.951 --> 04:47.053
And then, for no reason,
she just turned.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.220
It's always like that.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.456
- No fun...
- Always...

04:49.457 --> 04:50.723
- ...anymore.
- ...like that.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.725
- Nothing.
- One day it's okay,

04:52.726 --> 04:55.395
and then next day's
really weird,

04:55.396 --> 04:56.763
and nobody knows why.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.130
- Yeah.
- It's like the orchestra,

04:58.131 --> 04:59.466
you know?
They were together.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.233
- Yeah.
- Now it separated,

05:01.234 --> 05:03.903
together again, but who
knows what's gonna happen?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.372
It's always like this.
It's always changing.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.641
- Feh.
- Yeah. Hey.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.677
What about the sticky stuff?

05:10.678 --> 05:12.879
Oh, right, remember that one?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.046
Yeah, you're going...

05:14.047 --> 05:15.748
Yes. I finished it
before going to Venice.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.216
- Oh, shoot.
- Yes.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.919
But try this. Try this.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.454
Oh, my God.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.655
Give it... Give it a try.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.724
- Jesus.
- And you'll see.

05:29.296 --> 05:30.963
Right.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.400
Look at that.

05:34.768 --> 05:35.936
Wow.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.307
I fee like you're making
me play second fiddle

05:41.308 --> 05:42.676
in our relationship.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.546
Yes, I know I actually
play second fiddle.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.416
Why would you say that?

05:50.584 --> 05:52.652
How am I gonna get people
to play this for me?

05:52.653 --> 05:55.422
It's too small for
the orchestra people.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.289
Well, never
underestimate the power

05:57.290 --> 05:58.691
of free pizza and beer.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.693
I'm using it to build
a whole cabaret.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.729
It's the fire alarm.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.864
We got to go
to the courtyard.
Leave your stuff.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.670
Watch it, tuba.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.323
Hey, are you Esther Ohnn?

06:31.324 --> 06:33.292
- I am.
- Oh, wow.

06:33.293 --> 06:34.694
I'm a really big fan of yours.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.328
I know that sounds,
like, super nerdy.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.664
I just think it's really cool

06:37.665 --> 06:39.298
that you turned down
a residency at Julliard

06:39.299 --> 06:40.567
for the Moscow Symphony,

06:40.568 --> 06:42.535
and that you play
with BjÃ¶rk, and...

06:42.536 --> 06:44.471
Yeah.
I'm Hailey Rutledge.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.806
You're the one who threw up
on Andrew Walsh.

06:46.807 --> 06:51.143
Well, yeah, I threw up
around Andrew Walsh,

06:51.144 --> 06:52.211
and he fired me.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.746
Good. Because
after he asked me

06:53.747 --> 06:55.347
to wash his laundry by hand,

06:55.348 --> 06:57.484
I was out of there.
He is the bane.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.951
Yeah.
He's kind of the worst.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.655
Well, it is good to meet
another cult survivor.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.056
Uh, hey,

07:04.057 --> 07:06.859
I am putting together
an ensemble for an event,

07:06.860 --> 07:09.161
and I was just wondering
if you wanted to play.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.597
Does it pay?

07:10.598 --> 07:11.698
Do you like free beer?

07:11.699 --> 07:13.365
Yes. Who's conducting?

07:13.366 --> 07:14.400
I am.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.401
Okay. Cool.

07:15.402 --> 07:16.569
What?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.170
I'll do it.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.672
Shock and awe, right?

07:19.673 --> 07:22.576
Yeah. Shock and awe.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.114
All right, see you at rehearsal.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.651
It's some kind of
metacarpal fracture

07:31.652 --> 07:34.587
which explains
the chronic inflammation.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.789
What about another round
of injections?

07:36.790 --> 07:39.291
We can keep on with that
and the physio,

07:39.292 --> 07:44.531
but in the end
you're probably going
to need the surgery.

07:44.532 --> 07:47.166
However, if the surgery
goes well,

07:47.167 --> 07:50.237
there's a good chance you'll
still be able to play.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.373
I don't get it.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.542
Excuse me?

07:55.543 --> 07:56.776
The sign.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.445
Is that for the nurses
or for us?

08:02.315 --> 08:03.550
How did you do that?

08:03.551 --> 08:05.653
Too many threes.

08:06.654 --> 08:07.955
Too much Bach.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.023
Uh, threes...
Is that basketball?

08:11.024 --> 08:14.594
Yes. Kevin Masers.
New York Knicks.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.796
Cynthia Taylor,
New York Symphony.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.064
Oh, cool. You know,

08:18.065 --> 08:20.032
I play a mean "FÃ¼r Elise"
on the piano.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.134
- Yeah?
- Or at least I could.

08:23.403 --> 08:24.571
You had surgery?

08:24.572 --> 08:28.274
Yeah, ten days ago.
What about you?

08:28.275 --> 08:30.677
My metacarpal is jacked.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.578
A guy on my team had that.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.046
You know what helped him?

08:34.047 --> 08:35.313
Bourbon.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.716
With me.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.751
It was probably
just the bourbon.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.587
But you probably shouldn't
have it without me,

08:41.589 --> 08:42.589
just to be safe.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.222
Ahem. Ms. Taylor.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.491
Uh, here's a prescription.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.093
Remember to stay off that arm.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.094
Understand?

08:49.262 --> 08:50.598
Yep.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.272
Pull.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.141
Eh, kind of.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.943
Glad we didn't have to break in.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.244
Oh, yes.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.013
I can't believe these
things are still here.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.815
Oh, Maestro says
the bubbles can stay.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.217
We're in the bubble with them?

09:11.218 --> 09:12.318
- Eh.
- I don't know.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.753
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.321
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.724
Hey. Subbing for Betty?

09:17.725 --> 09:19.659
Yeah, just until the auditions,

09:19.660 --> 09:21.393
which is awesome
because I only have,

09:21.394 --> 09:22.995
like, $40 in my bank account.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.664
Do you know what piece
you're playing?

09:24.665 --> 09:26.532
Uh, yeah, I have
a couple of options.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.334
Let me know if you
want some help.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.335
Thanks.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.704
I missed this.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.107
- Hey, everyone.
- Maestro.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.242
Look at this.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.678
Wow, we... we're back
in our home.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.680
Wait. Why so few of you?

09:40.681 --> 09:41.981
It's the chamber group

09:41.982 --> 09:44.016
for the big donors'
gala, Maestro.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.017
What?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.919
Hi. Hello.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.487
Sit down, sit down, please.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.156
Take a seat. Take a seat.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.258
An, uh...

09:52.793 --> 09:54.962
How do you
guys feel? Okay?

09:55.896 --> 09:57.463
- Yeah?
- Good.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.597
Not tired?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.266
- No.
- Okay.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.601
Um...

10:03.771 --> 10:05.504
are those trees on?

10:05.505 --> 10:07.840
Is it me, or...
Or are they, like...

10:07.841 --> 10:09.475
- No, they have lights.
- They have them.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.710
- They have lights.
- Yeah.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.148
All right. Elegy.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.366
Maestro.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.568
Maestro.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.370
Hey...

10:38.371 --> 10:40.172
Okay. Ahem.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.708
Okay, let's keep on rehearsing.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.975
- You need a rest.
- Okay. No.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.576
- It's okay.
- Mm-hmm?

10:44.577 --> 10:45.545
Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

10:45.546 --> 10:46.779
I'm okay. Okay.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.247
Why don't you rehearse?
Okay?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.149
Why don't you keep on
rehearsing a little bit?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.351
Okay? Let's
keep on doing it,

10:52.352 --> 10:56.155
and I will be from here
supervising. Okay?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.424
- But you guys do it...
- Let's help him.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.305
...in the... in the best
way possible, you know?

11:03.430 --> 11:05.331
Ha ha.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.101
Oh, no. We're not
doing this one.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.404
It's okay. Use it
for warming up. Okay.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.445
Oh, man.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.438
Hai Lai?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.674
Cynthia?

11:48.675 --> 11:49.910
Tanya?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.154
Ai, those trees.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.858
Hello?

12:06.927 --> 12:09.162
Heh. You awake?

12:10.798 --> 12:12.099
Yeah.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.967
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.468
I'm Rodrigo de Sousa.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.604
Ah, I know who you are.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.439
You're the guy
on all the posters.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.474
Yes. Yes, I am.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.476
Yes, and you...
You are the...

12:24.477 --> 12:25.812
I'm just security.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.915
Yeah? I've never
seen you before now.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.716
I've been here 25 years.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.287
Whoa.

12:36.489 --> 12:37.689
What time is it?

12:37.690 --> 12:39.092
3 a.m.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.660
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.662
Did you get some rest?

12:43.663 --> 12:46.999
Oh, yes. Yes, I...
I really needed...

12:47.000 --> 12:49.368
I'm going to get some matÃ©.
Do you want some?

12:49.369 --> 12:50.369
Some what?

12:52.305 --> 12:54.406
- Were you here when...
- Yeah, I...

12:54.407 --> 12:56.175
Pembridge's "Eroica" was.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.010
I don't remember
that one so much.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.545
Yeah.
That... That's, like...

12:59.546 --> 13:01.747
I'm sorry, man. You know,
sometimes I just...

13:01.748 --> 13:03.382
I fall asleep.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.450
Why?

13:04.451 --> 13:07.486
You know, I...
I like jazz, Coltrane.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.889
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, Coltrane...

13:09.890 --> 13:11.023
Sure, no question.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.191
- And the...
- Of course.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.260
We can see the link
from Stravinsky.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.995
- Yeah.
- That's good.

13:15.996 --> 13:20.766
Yeah, but, you know, like,
Beethoven, Chopin, Bach...

13:20.767 --> 13:22.268
You... you don't
appreciate them?

13:22.269 --> 13:23.870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're okay,

13:23.871 --> 13:25.071
but, you know, they...

13:25.072 --> 13:26.338
I think I need that rhythm,

13:26.339 --> 13:27.739
you know, that kind of swing,

13:27.740 --> 13:29.041
like the pop

13:29.042 --> 13:31.343
that you get from,
like, jazz solos

13:31.344 --> 13:32.711
- and stuff like that.
- What...

13:32.712 --> 13:34.380
What do you think, then, that...

13:34.381 --> 13:36.582
I mean, what would
make it better for you?

13:36.583 --> 13:39.218
Uh, better costumes with it.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.619
Oh, yeah, well, definitely that.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.354
It's so formal.
In Cats...

13:42.355 --> 13:43.956
You ever see Cats on Broadway?

13:43.957 --> 13:45.257
- No.
- That show... The show Cats.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.293
They have, like,
whiskers and everything.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.128
It's different from this.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.296
Hmm.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.431
Yeah. Sorry.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.799
You know, I'll give you

13:53.800 --> 13:56.268
some tickets for next season.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.370
You come to the concerts,
you know,

13:58.371 --> 14:00.739
and maybe that'll make you
change your mind...

14:00.740 --> 14:01.974
...a little bit.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.043
I doubt it. No offense.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.278
But I...
I could bring my, uh,

14:06.279 --> 14:08.814
my grandson.
He plays the violin.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.282
- Mm.
- Yeah.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.452
He played the violin.
He stopped.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.921
Yeah, he just...
You know,

14:14.922 --> 14:16.255
lessons were expensive,

14:16.256 --> 14:18.925
and, uh, he just
didn't stick with it.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.927
- Hmm.
- Kids.

14:24.397 --> 14:31.003
But you know, when
a child is playing

14:31.004 --> 14:32.505
or running...

14:34.174 --> 14:36.176
- inside their minds...
- Hmm.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.345
They are listening to music.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.134
Oh. Hi. Welcome.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.735
That sounds like
it's really developing.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.337
- Yeah, it's coming on.
- Is that a second movement?

15:05.338 --> 15:06.838
- Here. That's for you.
- Thank you.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.207
I want you to go
back to the piece

15:08.208 --> 15:09.441
that we were working on before.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.110
- Right. Okay.
- Just no music.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.312
Just show me.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.282
Good.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.883
That's good, that's good.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.186
Uh, show me the way

15:20.187 --> 15:21.687
you bring in the bassoons again.

15:21.688 --> 15:22.989
Yeah.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.124
Oh. Very extravagant.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.525
Where... Where
did you get that?

15:26.526 --> 15:28.394
Uh, that's how Kutchar
was doing it on YouTube.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.462
Oh, that's his, then, isn't it?

15:30.463 --> 15:33.432
Uh, what does it
actually mean to you?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.734
Uh, well, it's all about
leaving Czechoslovakia

15:35.735 --> 15:37.669
- after the war...
- No, no, no. I get all that.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.038
That's just a book report.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.107
Uh, you can't just
conduct something

15:41.108 --> 15:42.874
because you think
it's interesting.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.310
You see, I'm trying to get you

15:44.311 --> 15:47.246
to find a piece of music

15:47.247 --> 15:49.115
that you can really feel

15:49.116 --> 15:50.916
and conduct
like no one else can.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.151
Hai Lai, hey.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.352
- Hey.
- What's up?

15:53.353 --> 15:54.620
I really have to talk to you.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.523
Uh, yeah. Are you just
appearing places now or...

15:57.524 --> 15:59.725
- I live here.
- No. No, he doesn't.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.893
- You said for the meantime...
- You're a guest.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.362
Look, do you mind?
You can see

16:03.363 --> 16:04.896
we're in the middle of a lesson.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.066
Oh, the lesson. Oh, you're
having a lesson with...

16:07.067 --> 16:08.267
- Yeah.
- The best.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.335
- He is.
- He's the best.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.037
- I know.
- Very lucky.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.072
Thank you.
We're trying to...

16:13.073 --> 16:14.540
- Can I talk to you?
- Can you... Yeah.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.875
Just give us
just a minute, Maestro.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.044
- Come with me.
- Okay.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.313
- Hai Lai.
- Yes, what?

16:21.381 --> 16:23.649
Do you want to have
a child with me?

16:23.650 --> 16:24.816
What?

16:24.817 --> 16:27.053
Let's have a child, you and me.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.121
Uh, I'll be right there.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.922
I'm doing something that's
really important to me,

16:30.923 --> 16:32.191
and I would really appreciate it

16:32.192 --> 16:34.060
if you would give me
the space to do that.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.961
- I give you the space.
- Sorry.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.763
Do you want to do this or not?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.331
I really, really do. Okay.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.733
So go back to, uh, measure...

16:41.734 --> 16:42.801
He's still here.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.338
You got to leave, man.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.740
Hey.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.076
Cynthia.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.843
- Maestro.
- Hey.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.080
Wow. This is really good.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.381
Ah, yeah, it works for me.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.083
Yes, yes, I'll do this for you.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.550
I can move in. Yeah, yeah.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.119
- What?
- Stay here. Yeah.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.288
You know, I stayed
with Gloria last time.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.089
I can stay here. Why not?

17:04.090 --> 17:05.457
It'll be fun.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.625
So wait.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.227
Bradford's not coming
to the opening?

17:08.228 --> 17:10.429
No. He's touring
with his documentary.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.763
- Hmm.
- It's really important
to him, you know?

17:12.765 --> 17:15.467
Yeah, and this really
matters to you.
He should be here.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.769
Yeah, he should really
be here, shouldn't he?

17:17.770 --> 17:19.738
Yes.

17:19.739 --> 17:20.739
What about Rodrigo?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.108
Is he gonna make it
for your big moment?

17:22.108 --> 17:23.474
Yeah, I was going to invite him,

17:23.476 --> 17:25.777
and then he, like, asked me
to have a child with him.

17:25.778 --> 17:26.912
Wait. What?

17:26.913 --> 17:28.714
Yeah, he was not being serious.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.981
How do you know?

17:29.982 --> 17:31.551
Because I know him.

17:32.752 --> 17:33.952
Have you ever just, like,

17:33.953 --> 17:37.289
asked Rodrigo what
the deal is with you two?

17:37.290 --> 17:39.658
No. I don't need to.
I know what the deal is.

17:39.659 --> 17:40.693
There isn't one.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.195
Okay.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.563
Just as long as you're not,

17:44.564 --> 17:46.333
you know, waiting
around for him.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.542
Ai, 'mano.

17:55.543 --> 17:57.143
'mano.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.044
It's the fucking five flights up

17:59.045 --> 18:01.347
and the five flights down.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.824
Uh, Â¿quiÃ©res algo a beber?

18:12.825 --> 18:14.160
Uh...

18:14.161 --> 18:15.227
una cerveza, por favor.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.295
Dos, dos, dos.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.396
Y un tequila.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.698
Yo no, yo no.
No yo.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.167
Ah, sÃ­.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.034
Cynthia. Look, look,

18:22.035 --> 18:23.068
Cynthia.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.003
Huh? My toca box.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.605
- What is that?
- Heh heh.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.912
Estoy bien.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.382
You know, Maestro Rivera,
he took it away from me.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.417
He took it away from me,
and he locked it up.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.186
He locked it up
with all my things.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.321
He locked it.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.734
- Mira.
- Ha ha!

19:10.783 --> 19:11.917
Hey, hey, no, no, no.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.220
No, no. Hey, Rodrigo.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.701
Mira.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.813
Claro Que sÃ­, Maestro.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.495
Look at this crowd.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.896
Half of Wall Street is here.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.065
I'm half expecting the SCC
to kick the door down.

20:00.066 --> 20:03.134
Yes. I'm going to make
my money back tonight.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.703
I can feel it. I don't care

20:04.704 --> 20:08.106
if I have to rifle through
pockets in the coat room.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.441
Sorry. What was that?

20:09.442 --> 20:10.942
We're doing great financially.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.245
That was a joke and
totally off the record.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.747
If you wouldn't mind stepping...

20:16.249 --> 20:17.583
Oh, my goodness.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.118
You look magnificent.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.687
Excuse me.
I have to work.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.222
- Oh, well...
- Ouch.

20:29.862 --> 20:30.962
Hey.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.464
Hey.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.200
So, uh, before?

20:35.201 --> 20:36.335
Hmm? Oh.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.137
Yeah, that was a bit much.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.407
Uh-huh.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.775
You know dark matter?

20:43.776 --> 20:44.577
What?

20:44.578 --> 20:46.244
Dark matter, you know?

20:46.245 --> 20:49.080
Yeah, the thing
that's all around us.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.950
Do you know why we know
it's around us?

20:51.951 --> 20:53.352
No.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.087
Because the universe
is expanding

20:56.088 --> 20:58.189
and contracting
at the same time.

20:58.190 --> 21:02.127
See? Changing it out
and changing it in.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.762
- Right.
- Like the present.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.731
Hmm.

21:04.732 --> 21:07.367
Are you ready for
the changes, Hailey?

21:08.868 --> 21:09.868
Yeah.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.937
I think they're
already happening.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.949
I guess I'm
in the doghouse again.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.150
So what did you do?

21:25.151 --> 21:26.585
I don't know what I did.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.487
I drove her to Long Island
and drove her back.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.521
I don't know.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.690
Maestro. Hi. Hello.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.159
Um, I will just cut
right to the chase.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.729
I would love to perform your
new piece with my ensemble.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.598
- Hell, no.
- You're writing again?

21:39.599 --> 21:42.768
Well, I mean, yes and no.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.870
- That's fantastic.
- It is fantastic,

21:44.871 --> 21:46.572
and it's exciting,
and it's dark,

21:46.573 --> 21:48.574
and it's brave,
and it's very sad,

21:48.575 --> 21:50.576
and... and the space
that I want to conduct it at

21:50.577 --> 21:52.611
is this emerging
art space in Brooklyn.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.780
- It's very cool.
- Oh, you should do it.

21:54.781 --> 21:55.748
Are you mad?

21:55.749 --> 21:58.717
You are a minor
electronic music star.

21:58.718 --> 21:59.619
Only minor?

21:59.620 --> 22:01.252
Brooklyn is your audience.

22:01.253 --> 22:03.254
Maestro, you said
that I should perform
works that I feel,

22:03.255 --> 22:04.656
and I really,
really feel this piece.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.091
Now, I know
that there are people

22:06.092 --> 22:07.993
probably lining up
around the block to do it...

22:07.994 --> 22:09.027
Oh, there aren't.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.796
He's hardly known at all.

22:10.797 --> 22:13.532
All right, that's
enough. Go on. Uh...

22:13.533 --> 22:15.401
Come on, come on.

22:15.402 --> 22:16.903
- All right.
- Yes.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.438
There'll be conditions.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.874
Bravo!

22:55.875 --> 22:57.877
Bravo, bravo!

23:00.547 --> 23:02.180
Thank you all.
Thank you all.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.749
Thank you so much for coming.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.317
We've had a triumphant return.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.119
We're stronger, we're better,

23:08.120 --> 23:09.921
but most importantly,

23:09.922 --> 23:11.457
we're together.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.125
She has such a big heart.

23:14.126 --> 23:16.027
She has such a big heart,

23:16.028 --> 23:17.629
Gloria Windsor, right?

23:17.630 --> 23:19.798
Yeah, a big heart, like a horse.

23:20.833 --> 23:21.634
Like a horse?

23:21.635 --> 23:23.068
Uh, thank you, Maestro.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.003
Thank you.

23:24.004 --> 23:26.905
Everyone here has
a big horse heart

23:26.906 --> 23:29.675
because we care about this city,

23:29.676 --> 23:32.343
this orchestra, and that's
why we're so excited

23:32.344 --> 23:35.180
to be asking you
to renew your commitment

23:35.181 --> 23:37.883
to the New York City
Symphony Orchestra.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.552
Because we have
some amazing news
to give you.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.287
Gloria is pregnant.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.224
Ah ha ha ha!

23:46.225 --> 23:47.593
And also...

23:47.594 --> 23:49.761
Warren Boyd is pregnant,

23:49.762 --> 23:51.997
and Bob the Union
is also pregnant,

23:51.998 --> 23:53.999
and Cynthia is also pregnant...

23:54.000 --> 23:55.501
All of you,
everyone, everybod...

23:55.502 --> 23:56.668
Me, I am pregnant.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.670
Why? Because we're announcing

23:58.671 --> 24:00.506
our best initiative yet,

24:00.507 --> 24:01.973
which is we're opening

24:01.974 --> 24:05.677
the New York Symphony
Youth Orchestra!

24:05.678 --> 24:07.412
Yay!

24:07.413 --> 24:09.949
Yes, aha, yes.

24:11.317 --> 24:15.320
But for now, this orchestra,
the main orchestra,

24:15.321 --> 24:17.322
we desperately need,

24:17.323 --> 24:19.024
we desperately need your help,

24:19.025 --> 24:20.125
so please,

24:20.126 --> 24:21.593
- if you could open...
- Any child...

24:21.594 --> 24:23.328
Any child that wants
to learn an instrument,

24:23.329 --> 24:25.597
he can come to us.
He or she can come to us,

24:25.598 --> 24:27.533
or... or we will go to them!

24:27.534 --> 24:28.667
Yes!

24:28.668 --> 24:30.268
Ha ha ha ha! And

24:30.269 --> 24:33.872
this amazing
long-term vision

24:33.873 --> 24:37.308
can only be possible
with your near-term support.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.610
And if there's a child

24:38.611 --> 24:40.011
that doesn't have an instrument,

24:40.012 --> 24:41.780
because most of them
don't have an instrument,

24:41.781 --> 24:43.949
well, we're going to give
it to them for free!

24:43.950 --> 24:46.217
Yes! Yes!

24:46.218 --> 24:48.554
Yes! Ha ha ha!

24:53.325 --> 24:55.561
- Do you want to add anything?
- No, I think you said it.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.262
Yes, okay, okay. Whoo!

24:57.263 --> 24:58.730
And, everyone,

24:58.731 --> 25:00.232
give generously and...

25:01.601 --> 25:03.001
Darling, we had no idea.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.836
Uh, yes, we're
full of surprises.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.840
- Yes.
- We are full of them.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.642
Oh, can we have this room

25:10.643 --> 25:12.210
for a quick minute,
please, fellas?

25:12.211 --> 25:14.580
Thank you so much.

25:14.581 --> 25:15.714
Thank you. Thank you.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.482
Are you angry?
I cannot tell.

25:17.483 --> 25:19.417
Look out!
Aah! Oh, my!

25:19.418 --> 25:21.286
- What?
- What are you thinking?

25:21.287 --> 25:24.322
- I'm trying to save...
- Yeah, but it's...

25:25.725 --> 25:28.193
You can't just go marching
to your own drummer!

25:28.194 --> 25:30.161
Let's talk about it
because if you're to be...

25:30.162 --> 25:33.231
You have to talk to me
about these things!

25:33.232 --> 25:35.801
I talk to you! I talk
to you all the time,

25:35.802 --> 25:37.235
- and you don't listen to me!
- I stayed for you!

25:37.236 --> 25:39.270
...what to do! Aah!

25:39.271 --> 25:40.606
Yes, I do promote...

25:40.607 --> 25:42.207
Gloria... Gloria...
Gloria! Gloria!
