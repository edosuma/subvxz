WEBVTT

00:07.338 --> 00:09.580
THEY GOT MY DAUGHTER.
SHE WAS HERE,

00:09.580 --> 00:12.783
BUT JERICHO FOUND HER AND TOOK
HER BACK TO AFGHANISTAN.
YOU'RE GOING TO AFGHANISTAN?

00:12.783 --> 00:15.216
SURE AM.
IT'S ABOUT
THE RAVEN RIVER EXPERIMENTS.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.148
THAT'S WHAT MY FRIEND WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

00:17.148 --> 00:20.151
HE TEXTED YOU.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE TEXT?

00:20.151 --> 00:22.353
THE FLASH-FORWARDS...
(lowers voice) THE BLACKOUT...

00:22.353 --> 00:25.296
WE CAN'T SOLVE IT WITHOUT YOU.
WE ENGINEERED THOUSANDS
OF FLASH-FORWARDS.

00:25.296 --> 00:28.129
WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES
FROM THE EFFECTS

00:28.129 --> 00:31.102
OF ANOTHER BLACKOUT.
WE HAVE TO ANCHOR CONSCIOUSNESS

00:31.102 --> 00:35.136
IF ANOTHER WAVE HAPPENS.
YOU'RE GONNA BE SAVED BY
THE LADY YOU SEE EVERY DAY.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.407
(grunts)

00:39.070 --> 00:41.672
I HAVE TO GET PREGNANT NOW.
I WANT THAT BABY.

00:41.672 --> 00:45.116
I WANT THIS SPECIFIC CHILD.
IT WAS SUPPOSED

00:45.116 --> 00:49.250
TO HAPPEN THIS WEEKEND.
IF IT'S BABY-MAKING YOU NEED,
I WILL TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.052
THAT NIGHT IN SOMALIA--
OH, DEMETRI. I'M PREGNANT.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.485
I REVIEWED YOUR UNCLE TEDDY'S
AUTOPSY X-RAYS.

00:54.485 --> 00:57.057
(wheezes)
YOU MURDERED HIM TO SEND
A MESSAGE. MESSAGE RECEIVED.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.060
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN--TWO MOLES,
IN CASE ONE IS CAUGHT.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.464
AND NOT ONE PERSON IN THE OFFICE
WOULD SUSPECT IT'S YOU.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.670
(Janis)
THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD--

01:09.670 --> 01:12.573
A 6-MILE
KILLER OBSTACLE COURSE.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.675
EVERY QUANTICO GRADUATE
DREADS IT,

01:14.675 --> 01:16.677
BUT WE ALL DO IT.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.410
I NEVER INTENDED
TO BE AN FBI AGENT.

01:19.410 --> 01:23.184
I WAS A LAWYER
AND HATED MY LIFE.
(Demetri) GO, JANIS!

01:23.184 --> 01:26.086
THEN I HAD THIS FRIEND
WHO JOINED THE BUREAU.
GO ON!
STOP BEING SUCH A GIRL!

01:26.086 --> 01:28.189
OH, STOP BEING SUCH A BITCH!

01:28.189 --> 01:31.692
I NEVER THOUGHT OF MYSELF
AS PARTICULARLY PATRIOTIC.
(rings)

01:31.692 --> 01:33.724
BUT IT SOUNDED COOL.
ALL RIGHT! YEAH!

01:33.724 --> 01:35.866
I LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING
PART OF SOMETHING,

01:35.866 --> 01:38.569
ACTUALLY TRYING TO MAKE
THE WORLD A SAFER PLACE.

01:38.569 --> 01:40.131
NICE GOING.

01:40.131 --> 01:42.273
(panting) YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TELL EVERYBODY

01:42.273 --> 01:45.206
I ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT,
RIGHT?
NO, I'M JUST GONNA SHOW 'EM
THIS PICTURE.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.208
(clicks)
OH! HEY!

01:47.208 --> 01:50.681
(laughs) LAST ONE
TO THE BARBED WIRE IS A WUSS.

01:50.681 --> 01:53.113
THAT WAS A $5 CAMERA!

01:53.113 --> 01:56.187
I LOVED IT.
I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT.
(grunting)

01:56.187 --> 01:58.819
QUANTICO MADE ME STRONG.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.892
IT TAUGHT ME WHAT MATTERED,
AND IT SHOWED ME I'M CAPABLE

02:01.892 --> 02:04.895
OF TACKLING PROBLEMS
I NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

02:04.895 --> 02:09.160
(both laughing)

02:09.160 --> 02:11.862
OF COURSE, I'VE NEVER
LIVED IN LOS ANGELES,

02:11.862 --> 02:14.505
SO WE'LL SEE
HOW I SURVIVE THIS.

02:14.505 --> 02:18.639
I'M SURE
YOU'LL DO JUST FINE.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.612
ARE YOU MARRIED?
OH, NO.

02:21.612 --> 02:24.875
I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME
FOR A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP.

02:24.875 --> 02:27.548
GOOD TO KNOW.

02:27.548 --> 02:31.282
(chuckles) I'M SORRY.
I'VE BEEN GOING ON AND ON.

02:31.282 --> 02:34.255
UM,
WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?

02:34.255 --> 02:36.487
I'M LITA.

02:36.487 --> 02:38.489
WE'LL TAKE TWO MORE.

02:41.632 --> 02:46.867
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.869
I'M A HEADHUNTER.

02:48.869 --> 02:52.843
I FIND TALENTED PEOPLE
LIKE YOURSELF AND...

02:52.843 --> 02:55.576
OFFER THEM OPPORTUNITIES.

02:55.576 --> 02:58.249
(chuckles)

02:58.249 --> 03:01.412
(laughing)

03:03.484 --> 03:06.217
WELL, I JUST STARTED
AT THE BUREAU,

03:06.217 --> 03:09.360
AND I'M NOT REALLY
LOOKING TO QUIT.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.191
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT QUITTING?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.724
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR JOB.

03:13.724 --> 03:16.867
I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT
A LITTLE MULTITASKING.

03:24.935 --> 03:28.339
(Janis) THESE ARE
THE BLUEPRINTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS

03:28.339 --> 03:31.412
THAT MARK FOUND ON FROST.
THE ORIGINALS ARE BEING ANALYZED
BY FORENSICS RIGHT NOW.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.484
THE ONLY OTHER THING
OF POTENTIAL RELEVANCE

03:33.484 --> 03:35.586
IS FROST'S FINAL BON MOT--

03:35.586 --> 03:39.219
"IN THE END YOU'LL BE SAVED
BY THE LADY YOU SEE EVERY DAY."

03:39.219 --> 03:41.922
I CAN'T SPEAK
ON BEHALF OF EVERYONE,

03:41.922 --> 03:46.226
BUT I'M STILL CONTEMPLATING
THE UNBELIEVABLE FACT

03:46.226 --> 03:48.659
THAT WE HAD
THE POSSIBLE MASTERMIND

03:48.659 --> 03:50.631
OF THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT
IN OUR HANDS,

03:50.631 --> 03:53.864
AND JUST BEFORE HE'S ABLE TO
DIVULGE ANY REAL INFORMATION,

03:53.864 --> 03:56.937
HE'S KILLED BY A TERRORIST WHO,
JUST MERE HOURS BEFORE,

03:56.937 --> 04:00.641
WAS IN OUR CUSTODY. NOW HOW
THE HELL DOES THAT HAPPEN?

04:00.641 --> 04:03.814
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT I DO KNOW
IS DEMETRI NOH IS ALIVE.

04:03.814 --> 04:06.447
YEAH, AND ALDA'S FREE AGAIN,

04:06.447 --> 04:08.979
WHICH MEANS DEMETRI
WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG--

04:08.979 --> 04:11.282
THAT SHE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN
THIS THING SINCE THE BEGINNING,

04:11.282 --> 04:13.624
EVEN BEFORE YOU GUYS
STARTED SURVEILLING HER.

04:13.624 --> 04:17.388
BELIEVE ME, I WANT HER BACK
JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DO.
(Janis) IN THE MEANTIME,

04:17.388 --> 04:19.660
FROST DID CONFIRM THAT THERE
WILL BE ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.893
HE WAS COMING IN FROM THE COLD,
AND THESE BLUEPRINTS

04:22.893 --> 04:25.436
AND PHOTOGRAPHS ARE WHAT
HE WAS BRINGING WITH HIM.

04:25.436 --> 04:27.838
THAT ALONE MAKES THEM VITAL
TO OUR INVESTIGATION.

04:27.838 --> 04:29.840
THIS MAN WAS INSANE.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.304
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT ANYTHING
HE'S EVEN GIVING US IS CREDIBLE?

04:33.304 --> 04:36.607
BECAUSE CRAZY AS HE WAS,
HE WAS ALWAYS TRUE TO HIS WORD.

04:36.607 --> 04:40.881
BUT IF YOU WANT TO KICK OVER
MORE ANTHILLS--
MARK,
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHAT I--

04:40.881 --> 04:44.385
CAN WE PLEASE DIAL BACK
THE TESTOSTERONE? THAT'S ENOUGH.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.757
THANK YOU.

04:46.757 --> 04:49.660
JANIS IS RUNNING POINT
ON PHOTOS AND BLUEPRINTS,

04:49.660 --> 04:52.963
HIGH PRIORITY. SHEL, DEM SAID
FROST REFERENCED SOMETHING

04:52.963 --> 04:55.396
CALLED RAVEN RIVER
AS THE PLACE

04:55.396 --> 04:57.568
WHERE THE FLASH-FORWARDS
STARTED HAPPENING.

04:57.568 --> 05:00.971
SEE WHAT YOU CAN
FIND OUT ABOUT IT.
THIS TRACKS SOMETHING
I WAS ALREADY RUNNING DOWN.

05:00.971 --> 05:03.504
SO KEEP RUNNING.
WHEN DEMETRI GETS BACK,

05:03.504 --> 05:05.906
HE CAN JUMP IN WITH YOU.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.908
LOOK, WE'RE CLEARLY
ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.840
THE BAD GUYS
WERE OBVIOUSLY DESPERATE

05:09.840 --> 05:11.842
TO KEEP US
FROM GETTING TO FROST.

05:11.842 --> 05:15.015
LET'S TAKE THAT AS A SIGN WE'RE
GETTING WARMER AND PUSH ON.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.848
OKAY, SO RUN HIS LABS.

05:17.848 --> 05:20.621
START AN I.V.
I'LL BE THERE IN TEN MINUTES.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.394
YEAH. BYE.
(beep)

05:23.394 --> 05:26.026
IT'S IMPORTANT, OLIVIA!
(glass shatters)

05:26.026 --> 05:27.958
AAH! (panting)

05:30.030 --> 05:32.863
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

05:32.863 --> 05:35.335
I KNOW YOU.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.768
MY HUSBAND IS FBI, OKAY?
SO THERE'S AN AGENT

05:37.768 --> 05:41.742
RIGHT OUT FRONT. I'M GONNA CALL
HIM, AND HE'S GONNA TAKE YOU--
THE PIXIES. THE PIXIES.
YOU WERE THERE.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.744
YOU WERE THERE.
YOU WORE A PURPLE BERET.

05:43.744 --> 05:46.417
THE DRINK SPILLED ON THE LADY
IN FRONT. SHE GOT MAD.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.419
SHE GOT SO MAD. (laughs)

05:48.419 --> 05:50.381
I WAS THERE, TOO,
WITH MY HANDLER, BARRY.

05:50.381 --> 05:52.683
BARRY LOST HIS JOB FOR
TAKING ME TO A PIXIES CONCERT.

05:52.683 --> 05:55.055
THEY CLOSED WITH
"WAVE OF MUTILATION."
THE SUMMER AFTER MED SCHOOL?

05:55.055 --> 05:58.028
I WAS AT SCOTT'S WEDDING
AT THE VINEYARD.

05:58.028 --> 06:01.031
REMEMBER SCOTT'S WEDDING
AT THE VINEYARD?

06:01.031 --> 06:03.564
YOUR DRESS WAS TURQUOISE.
YOU CRIED. IT WAS SAD.

06:03.564 --> 06:06.036
IT WAS SO SAD.
THEY SERVED MINI CORN DOGS.
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

06:06.036 --> 06:07.898
I'M GABRIEL McDOW.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

06:07.898 --> 06:11.001
I SAID--I DEFINITELY
SAID THAT ALREADY.

06:11.001 --> 06:15.045
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THINGS,
OLIVIA.
LIKE I SAID, MY HUSBAND IS FBI,
SO THERE'S AN AGENT OUT FRONT.

06:15.045 --> 06:18.078
I'M GONNA CALL HIM,
AND HE'S GONNA TAKE YOU AWAY.
HE'S NOT YOUR HUSBAND.
LLOYD--YOU KNOW LLOYD? LLOYD IS.

06:18.078 --> 06:21.612
WHAT?
YEAH, YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
YOU SHOULD BE WITH LLOYD.

06:21.612 --> 06:23.714
I TRIED TO STOP YOU,
ONLY YOU DON'T KNOW THAT,

06:23.714 --> 06:26.557
BECAUSE I ONLY TRIED TO
STOP YOU. I HAVE TO TELL YOU

06:26.557 --> 06:28.889
ALL ABOUT IT. IT WAS A THURSDAY.
THERE'S SO MUCH I NEED

06:28.889 --> 06:31.622
TO TELL YOU.
IT'S ALL AT RAVEN RIVER.
GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!

06:31.622 --> 06:33.564
NO, DON'T GO! DON'T GO!
THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING

06:33.564 --> 06:35.826
IS IN THE EATING! DON'T BUY
COFFEE TODAY FROM THE MAN

06:35.826 --> 06:37.928
THAT LOOKS LIKE MR. CLEAN!
DON'T BUY COFFEE TODAY!

06:37.928 --> 06:40.871
DON'T BUY COFFEE, TODAY!
DAN, THERE'S A MAN
IN MY HOUSE! DAN!

06:40.871 --> 06:43.033
JANIS, THANK YOU FOR COMING IN
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

06:43.033 --> 06:45.405
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOUR BABY.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.009
WHY? I THOUGHT YOU SAID
EVERYTHING LOOKED GOOD.

06:49.009 --> 06:52.483
YOU'RE ANEMIC, AND YOU HAVEN'T
GAINED ENOUGH WEIGHT.

06:52.483 --> 06:54.545
I WANT YOU TO SEE
A PERINATOLOGIST

06:54.545 --> 06:57.417
TO GET A HIGH-RESOLUTION
ULTRASOUND.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.551
NOW SHE'LL MAKE SURE
THAT THE PLACENTA'S OKAY

07:00.551 --> 07:02.993
AND THE BABY IS GROWING.
AND WHAT IF IT ISN'T?

07:02.993 --> 07:06.797
FIRST THINGS FIRST.
GET THAT ULTRASOUND,

07:06.797 --> 07:10.060
AND GET IT SOON.
YOU'VE GOT TO PROTECT YOUR BABY.

07:10.060 --> 07:12.833
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.066
YEAH, BUT, MARK,
HE WAS IN OUR HOUSE.

07:16.066 --> 07:18.068
I MEAN,
I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

07:18.068 --> 07:20.040
(Mark) Charlie must have
been terrified.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.943
NO, CHARLIE WAS
ALREADY AT SCHOOL.
Why would this man
be stalking you?

07:22.943 --> 07:25.015
I DON'T KNOW.
ALL I KNOW IS THAT

07:25.015 --> 07:27.778
THERE'S SOMETHING
INCREDIBLY WRONG WITH HIM.

07:27.778 --> 07:30.951
OKAY, LOOK, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.
Soon.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.884
OKAY. BYE.
RALPH, WHAT HAPPENED?
(people shouting indistinctly)

07:33.884 --> 07:36.126
SOME TEENAGER DRIVING
AND TEXTING JUMPED A CURB

07:36.126 --> 07:38.659
AND HIT A COUPLE PEOPLE
WAITING FOR COFFEE OUT FRONT.

07:38.659 --> 07:42.062
HE WAS GOING, LIKE, 80.
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.735
(siren wailing)

07:44.735 --> 07:47.197
(indistinct shouting continues)

07:47.197 --> 07:49.169
DON'T BUY COFFEE TODAY

07:49.169 --> 07:52.172
FROM THE MAN
THAT LOOKS LIKE MR. CLEAN!

07:52.172 --> 07:54.875
OH, MY GOD.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.554
(door bells chime)

08:20.931 --> 08:22.933
CAN I HELP YOU, HON?

08:22.933 --> 08:24.905
YEAH.

08:24.905 --> 08:28.979
I'M LOOKING FOR SOME
RED FLOWER DRAGON HEADS.

08:28.979 --> 08:31.511
(chuckles) YOU MEAN SOME
RED DRAGON FLOWERHORNS?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.083
YEAH.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.218
DO YOU HAVE ANY HERE?

08:38.218 --> 08:41.622
I MIGHT. DO YOU HAVE
A FRESHWATER TANK OR SALTWATER?

08:41.622 --> 08:44.294
I'M SORRY. I WAS SUPPOSED
TO ASK FOR CARLINE.

08:44.294 --> 08:45.956
THAT'S ME.

08:45.956 --> 08:47.297
OH.

08:47.297 --> 08:51.562
UM... I'M JANIS.

08:51.562 --> 08:53.604
LITA SENT ME TO YOU.

08:53.604 --> 08:56.136
I KNOW. SO LET'S GET YOU SET UP
WITH AN AQUARIUM, SHALL WE?

08:56.136 --> 08:58.669
YEAH, I DON'T ACTUALLY
REALLY NEED AN AQUARIUM.

08:58.669 --> 09:01.712
I THINK A 5-GALLON TANK
OUGHT TO DO THE TRICK.

09:01.712 --> 09:04.314
WE GOT YOUR BLUE CORAL HERE,
A POWER SUPPLY, AIR FILTER,

09:04.314 --> 09:06.717
WATER CONDITIONER,
A COUPLE OF PLANTS

09:06.717 --> 09:08.879
AND SOME INCANDESCENT BULBS.

09:08.879 --> 09:12.022
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.
HONEY, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE COMING IN HERE

09:12.022 --> 09:16.326
EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS TO TALK
TO ME, THEN YOU NEED AN EXCUSE.
YEAH,
I DON'T REALLY LIKE FISH.

09:16.326 --> 09:17.958
YOU DO NOW.

09:17.958 --> 09:21.762
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK--
NEON TETRAS OR ZEBRA FISH?

09:21.762 --> 09:24.294
THE... TETRAS, I GUESS.

09:24.294 --> 09:29.970
I'M SORRY. WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING?
WELL, FOR NOW, YOUR JOB.

09:29.970 --> 09:34.074
BE THE BEST SPECIAL AGENT AT
THE L.A. BUREAU THAT YOU CAN BE.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.046
WATCH, WAIT, WIN THEIR TRUST.

09:36.046 --> 09:39.209
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, KEEP US
APPRISED OF WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.

09:39.209 --> 09:43.013
NOW THESE SWORDTAILS
CAN BE VERY AGGRESSIVE.

09:43.013 --> 09:45.585
SOMETIMES THEY EAT EACH OTHER.
HMM.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.058
FISH ARE LIKE THAT.

09:48.058 --> 09:50.360
HERE WE GO.

09:50.360 --> 09:54.224
THE PHOTOS THAT WE FOUND
ON FROST ARE PLATINUM PRINTS,

09:54.224 --> 09:57.768
WHICH DATES THE PHOTOS
BETWEEN 1890 TO 1917.

09:57.768 --> 09:59.770
BUT THE GUY
FROM THE GETTY SAYS

09:59.770 --> 10:02.032
THAT IT'S LIKELY THE LATTER
PART OF THAT TIME PERIOD.

10:02.032 --> 10:04.134
WE WERE ABLE TO RECOVER
TWO SETS OF PRINTS--

10:04.134 --> 10:06.106
FROST'S, OF COURSE,
AND ALDA HERTZOG'S.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.009
ALDA? HOW WOULD SHE HAVE GOTTEN
HER HANDS ON THESE PHOTOS?

10:09.009 --> 10:12.342
MAYBE SHE WAS WITH HIM
BEFORE HE MET WITH YOU?

10:12.342 --> 10:15.345
NO. SHE BARELY WOULD HAVE HAD
TIME TO MAKE IT TO THE DESERT

10:15.345 --> 10:20.220
BEFORE KILLING FROST. THEY MUST
HAVE CROSSED PATHS EVEN EARLIER.
ANOTHER WEIRD THING--

10:20.220 --> 10:22.222
FORENSICS ANALYZED
THESE PHOTOS

10:22.222 --> 10:24.394
AND THE BLUEPRINTS
FOR TRACE CHEMICALS,

10:24.394 --> 10:27.658
AND THEY FOUND PARTICULATE
MATTER SPECIFIC TO SOIL

10:27.658 --> 10:31.361
IN THE KUNAR PROVINCE
OF AFGHANISTAN.

10:31.361 --> 10:33.363
YEP, U.S. DEPARTMENT
OF AGRICULTURE

10:33.363 --> 10:36.136
KEEPS A SOIL DATABASE.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.039
WHAT WOULD FROST
BE DOING IN AFGHANISTAN?

10:43.143 --> 10:47.647
(man singing
in Middle Eastern language)

10:47.647 --> 10:50.821
(indistinct conversations)

10:50.821 --> 10:54.084
â™ªâ™ª

10:59.189 --> 11:01.992
(man speaks
Middle Eastern language)

11:01.992 --> 11:04.294
DON'T LOOK SO ALARMED.

11:04.294 --> 11:06.897
YOU WILL ONLY DRAW
MORE ATTENTION.

11:09.399 --> 11:13.143
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M HERE AT THE REQUEST OF OUR
MUTUAL FRIEND STANFORD WEDECK.

11:13.143 --> 11:15.405
YOU'RE MALIK?
AND YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

11:15.405 --> 11:17.908
BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO EXCHANGE BIOGRAPHIES.

11:17.908 --> 11:20.310
WE NEED TO LEAVE.
YOU ALREADY SAID THAT.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.090
(indistinct conversations)

11:30.090 --> 11:32.092
THOSE MEN OVER THERE--

11:32.092 --> 11:34.094
ONE OF THEM
IS MAKING A PHONE CALL.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.466
(cell phone beeps)
THE BEST OUTCOME
OF THAT CALL IS A MAN

11:36.466 --> 11:38.829
ON HIS WAY HERE
TO KIDNAP YOU.

11:38.829 --> 11:41.131
THE WORST--THAT MAN WITH A BOMB
STRAPPED TO HIS CHEST.

11:41.131 --> 11:45.075
I BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL
A LOSE/LOSE SITUATION.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.142
YOU DON'T BLEND
AS WELL AS YOU THINK.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.750
(Janis) THANK YOU,
PROFESSOR COREY,

11:59.750 --> 12:01.321
FOR LOOKING AT THESE.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.824
IF THESE BLUEPRINTS
CAN BE AUTHENTICATED,

12:03.824 --> 12:06.326
THIS WOULD BE
AN INCREDIBLY COOL FIND.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.059
KIND OF REMINDS ME A LOT
OF THE ANTIKYTHERA MECHANISM.

12:09.059 --> 12:11.862
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT.

12:11.862 --> 12:14.334
IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT MYSTERIES
OF MODERN SCIENCE.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.336
(beep)
IT WAS A BRONZE ARTIFACT

12:16.336 --> 12:19.009
DISCOVERED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
IN 1901.

12:19.009 --> 12:23.043
TURNED OUT TO BE THIS INCREDIBLY
SOPHISTICATED SORT OF CALCULATOR

12:23.043 --> 12:26.016
FROM SECOND CENTURY B.C. GREECE.
THEY'VE GOT IT ON DISPLAY AT

12:26.016 --> 12:28.448
THE NATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY MUSEUM
IN ATHENS.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.021
AND YOU THINK THIS
IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
MM-HMM.

12:31.021 --> 12:33.884
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE IT.
THE ANTIKYTHERA CALCULATED DATES

12:33.884 --> 12:36.987
OF SOLAR ECLIPSES,
BUT I'LL BE DAMNED

12:36.987 --> 12:39.990
IF I CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT THIS CALCULATES.

12:39.990 --> 12:42.332
IF YOU'LL LET ME KEEP THESE,
I'LL SCAN THEM,

12:42.332 --> 12:45.996
DO SOME 3-D IMAGING,
TRANSLATE THE ANCIENT GREEK

12:45.996 --> 12:47.998
AND, UH, SEE WHAT
I CAN COME UP WITH.

12:47.998 --> 12:50.070
CALL ME
WHEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.402
(horns honking)

12:55.005 --> 12:58.979
WHO HAS COPIES OF THESE?
WE'VE GOT
AN ANTIQUITIES PROFESSOR

12:58.979 --> 13:01.181
STUDYING THE ORIGINALS
RIGHT NOW,

13:01.181 --> 13:04.114
AND BENFORD'S
GOT A COPY ON HIS BOARD.
GET THEM BACK.

13:04.114 --> 13:06.186
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:06.186 --> 13:08.989
I MEAN GET ME THE ORIGINAL
AND DESTROY EVERY COPY

13:08.989 --> 13:11.291
THAT'S BEEN MADE.
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
ABOUT THIS THING?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.293
I DON'T RECALL
ANSWERING QUESTIONS

13:13.293 --> 13:15.225
BEING PART
OF OUR ARRANGEMENT.

13:15.225 --> 13:18.068
THE INFORMATION GOES ONE WAY,
PERIOD.

13:18.068 --> 13:20.270
(taps table)
GET ME THESE BLUEPRINTS.

13:20.270 --> 13:22.873
(paper crinkles)

13:45.455 --> 13:47.097
(switch clicks)

14:03.443 --> 14:05.445
(beeping)

14:15.555 --> 14:17.627
(beeping)

14:17.627 --> 14:19.589
(electricity crackles)

14:19.589 --> 14:21.031
(beep)

14:24.995 --> 14:26.396
(keys jangle)

14:26.396 --> 14:28.868
(exhales deeply)

14:28.868 --> 14:31.871
SWEETIE, YOU WANT ME TO MAKE YOU
THAT FROZEN PIZZA?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.603
NO. I'M ALL FULL ON POPCORN.

14:33.603 --> 14:35.345
OKAY.

14:35.345 --> 14:38.108
(woman) SQUIRRLIO.
I'LL GIVE YOU 20 BUCKS
FOR IT.

14:38.108 --> 14:41.111
(cartoon continues
playing indistinctly)

15:26.156 --> 15:27.697
(beeping)

15:27.697 --> 15:29.699
(beep, door unlocks)

15:40.110 --> 15:42.542
(beeping)

15:42.542 --> 15:45.675
(unlocks)

15:59.059 --> 16:00.960
(Mark) WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.062
(gasps)

16:13.303 --> 16:15.275
(Mark)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JANIS?

16:18.748 --> 16:21.551
I TOTALLY SCREWED UP, MARK.

16:21.551 --> 16:23.553
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.418
YOU BROKE INTO MY OFFICE,
AND YOU'RE REMOVING THINGS

16:28.418 --> 16:32.122
FROM THE MOSAIC BOARD.
I KNOW.

16:32.122 --> 16:35.565
I'M AN IDIOT.
PROFESSOR COREY CALLED ME.

16:35.565 --> 16:38.568
PROFESSOR COREY?
THE ANTIQUITIES PROFESSOR.

16:38.568 --> 16:42.432
HE MISPLACED THE BLUEPRINTS
THAT I GAVE HIM.

16:42.432 --> 16:45.105
SO MAKE HIM ANOTHER COPY.
I GAVE HIM THE ORIGINALS.

16:45.105 --> 16:49.579
YOU HAVE THE ONLY OTHER COPY.
YOU DIDN'T CHECK
THE ORIGINALS INTO EVIDENCE?

16:49.579 --> 16:52.582
NO. I HAD
A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT,

16:52.582 --> 16:54.744
SO I JUST BROUGHT 'EM
WITH ME.

16:54.744 --> 16:56.786
HOW'D YOU GET IN?

16:56.786 --> 16:59.789
YOU GAVE ME YOUR PASSCODE.
WHEN?

16:59.789 --> 17:03.723
THAT TIME... YOU WERE
IN WASHINGTON WITH WEDECK,

17:03.723 --> 17:06.756
AND YOU NEEDED ME TO GET...
THE GEYER FILE FOR YOU.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.132
RIGHT.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.035
THIS IS A ROOKIE MISTAKE,
JANIS.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.337
HAND BACK THE BLUEPRINTS.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.739
YOU CAN GET YOUR COPIES
TOMORROW.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.641
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.074
I KNOW.

17:24.074 --> 17:26.045
I'M SORRY.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.479
(door opens)

17:30.820 --> 17:35.125
I'M TELLING YOU, SHEL, HE SEEMED
TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT ME.

17:35.125 --> 17:38.057
I MEAN, LOOK,
THERE HE IS AGAIN.
AND YOU'RE SURE
YOU DON'T KNOW THIS GUY?

17:38.057 --> 17:41.091
NO, BELIEVE ME. I WOULD
HAVE REMEMBERED HIM.
THAT'S WEIRD.

17:41.091 --> 17:42.762
AND HE BROUGHT UP
RAVEN RIVER AGAIN,

17:42.762 --> 17:45.365
LIKE HE DID THE OTHER DAY.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.397
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT IS?

17:47.397 --> 17:50.069
YEAH.
THAT'S AN INTERESTING THING.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.071
THERE'S A SUSPECT
WE WERE TRACKING

17:52.071 --> 17:54.744
WITH THE MOSAIC INVESTIGATION.
WELL, HE HAD MENTIONED SOMETHING

17:54.744 --> 17:59.179
ABOUT RAVEN RIVER TO DEMETRI,
SO I DID SOME RESEARCH.
WELL, THAT'S CRAZY.
DOES MARK KNOW ABOUT THIS?

17:59.179 --> 18:01.551
I'M PUTTING THE REPORT
TOGETHER FOR HIM NOW.

18:01.551 --> 18:04.554
THERE'S A FEW RAVEN RIVERS.
THERE'S ONE IN WISCONSIN,

18:04.554 --> 18:07.217
ONE IN ILLINOIS.
THERE'S A TENNIS CLUB IN OHIO

18:07.217 --> 18:11.161
AND A RAVEN RIVER HOSPITAL
IN ARIZONA.
WELL, WHAT KIND OF HOSPITAL?

18:11.161 --> 18:13.523
PSYCH HOSPITAL. IT'S BEEN SHUT
DOWN FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS NOW,

18:13.523 --> 18:17.167
AND THERE WAS SOME CONTROVERSY
IN THE LATE '80s--ABUSES.
WHAT KIND OF PATIENTS?

18:17.167 --> 18:19.569
SCHIZOPHRENICS,
AND THEY WERE THE FIRST HOSPITAL

18:19.569 --> 18:22.432
IN THE COUNTRY
TO DEAL WITH AUTISM.

18:22.432 --> 18:25.205
AUTISM?
W-WHAT ABOUT SAVANTS?

18:29.679 --> 18:32.342
(crickets chirping)

18:35.885 --> 18:38.117
SHE WAS TRYING
TO GET AWAY FROM THEM.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.390
THAT'S WHY SHE CAME HOME.
BUT JERICHO--

18:40.390 --> 18:43.753
THEY GOT EYES EVERYWHERE.
NOW THEY BROUGHT HER BACK HERE.

18:43.753 --> 18:47.157
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THEY HAVE NOT KILLED HER?
I KNOW.

18:47.157 --> 18:48.828
YOU HAVE PROOF?

18:48.828 --> 18:53.132
SHE'S ALIVE. I'VE SEEN IT.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.804
(whoosh)

18:54.804 --> 18:57.637
YOU SEEM CONFIDENT
IN YOUR BELIEFS.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.410
I ENVY YOU.

19:00.410 --> 19:03.413
YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHAT YOU'RE
ASKING IS NO SMALL UNDERTAKING.

19:03.413 --> 19:05.415
KANDAHAR IS NOT BAGHDAD,
MR. STARK.

19:05.415 --> 19:07.317
IT'S NOT EVEN KABUL.

19:07.317 --> 19:09.279
FINDING A SINGLE PERSON
ANYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY

19:09.279 --> 19:11.781
IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE.
THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE THERE,

19:11.781 --> 19:14.484
SOMEONE I THINK
CAN LEAD US TO HER.
WHO?

19:14.484 --> 19:16.826
HIS NAME'S KHAMIR DEJAN.
HE'S A DOCTOR--

19:16.826 --> 19:19.659
FRIEND OF TRACY'S. HE KNOWS
THE LOCATION WHERE I FOUND HER.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.831
WE FIND HIM,
HE CAN LEAD US THERE.

19:21.831 --> 19:24.834
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
EVEN IF HE IS IN THIS REGION,

19:24.834 --> 19:27.797
IT WILL TAKE TIME.
WHERE SHE WAS, THERE WAS
WRITINGS ON THE WALL.

19:27.797 --> 19:30.370
DOES THAT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU?

19:30.370 --> 19:33.172
EYES ON THE MOUNTAIN.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.206
IT'S A MEDICAL RELIEF
ORGANIZATION, NONGOVERNMENTAL.

19:36.206 --> 19:38.378
YOU SAID THAT KHAMIR
WAS A DOCTOR.
YEAH.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.380
THIS GROUP--THEY HAVE BASES
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.583
IF HE IS WORKING FOR THEM,
WE CAN FIND HIM.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.285
AND THE ROADBLOCKS?

19:45.285 --> 19:48.888
I KNOW ALL OF THEM.
I KNOW HOW TO GET AROUND THEM.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.360
WHERE DO WE START?

19:50.360 --> 19:52.862
WE HEAD SOUTH
TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS.

19:57.927 --> 20:02.201
(woman) I'VE SEEN THE TEST
RESULTS FROM DR. WEAVER.
(beeping)

20:02.201 --> 20:05.805
LET'S HAVE A LOOK, SHALL WE?
THERE'S YOUR BABY,

20:05.805 --> 20:08.308
AND THERE'S THE HEARTBEAT.
(heart beating)

20:08.308 --> 20:10.310
IS SHE OKAY?

20:10.310 --> 20:11.941
IS SHE TOO SMALL?

20:11.941 --> 20:14.684
NO, THE HEAD SIZE IS NORMAL.

20:14.684 --> 20:16.946
PLACENTAL BLOOD FLOW,
IT'S--IT'S OKAY.

20:16.946 --> 20:19.849
BUT THE ABDOMINAL GIRTH
ISN'T WHAT I'D WANT TO SEE.

20:19.849 --> 20:21.891
I KNOW YOUR WORK IS
VERY DEMANDING, JANIS,

20:21.891 --> 20:24.994
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO
TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOURSELF.

20:24.994 --> 20:27.327
GET EIGHT TO NINE HOURS
OF SLEEP A NIGHT,

20:27.327 --> 20:29.729
EAT A HIGH-PROTEIN DIET
AND...
(cell phone rings)

20:29.729 --> 20:32.962
REDUCE YOUR STRESS.
(ring)

20:32.962 --> 20:35.635
YOU KNOW THOSE ARE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE ON IN HERE.
(beep)

20:35.635 --> 20:37.637
LOOK, I KNOW LIFE
IS COMPLICATED. EVERYONE'S IS.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.839
BUT THE HEALTH OF YOUR BABY
DEPENDS ON YOUR ABILITY

20:39.839 --> 20:41.641
TO--TO STAY OFF YOUR FEET

20:41.641 --> 20:43.913
AND LOWER YOUR STRESS.
I'M SERIOUS.

20:43.913 --> 20:46.976
OTHERWISE,
YOU COULD LOSE THIS BABY.

20:46.976 --> 20:48.378
(ringing)

20:48.378 --> 20:50.750
I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO TAKE IT.
IT'S MY BOSS.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.422
(beep)
HEY, MARK.

20:52.422 --> 20:54.584
PROFESSOR COREY'S
SITTING IN MY OFFICE,

20:54.584 --> 20:57.687
AND HE'S JUST GIVEN ME SOME
VERY INTERESTING INFORMATION.

20:57.687 --> 21:00.029
I think you better
get back here.

21:02.292 --> 21:04.964
PROFESSOR COREY.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.897
MS. HAWK. WEIRDEST THING
HAPPENED YESTERDAY.
(typing)

21:07.897 --> 21:10.740
THERE WAS A POWER FAILURE
IN THE ENTIRE BUILDING,

21:10.740 --> 21:13.903
ERASED EVERY HARD DRIVE
IN THE JOINT.
REALLY?

21:13.903 --> 21:16.946
YEAH. AND I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND
THOSE BLUEPRINTS YOU GAVE ME...

21:16.946 --> 21:20.380
WHICH IS WHY
IT'S A DAMN GOOD THING

21:20.380 --> 21:23.282
I TOOK PICTURES ON MY PHONE
AND PRINTED 'EM OUT.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.015
I WANTED TO GET A HEAD START.
GREAT.

21:26.015 --> 21:29.789
I, UH, DID SOME QUICK AND DIRTY
3-D IMAGING OF THE DEVICE.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.791
SEEMS TO BE SOME KIND
OF MECHANICAL,

21:31.791 --> 21:34.293
ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK...
(beeping)

21:34.293 --> 21:37.897
WITH GEARS AND LEVERS DESIGNED
TO CALCULATE A CERTAIN DATE,

21:37.897 --> 21:40.400
OR RATHER, A SERIES OF DATES.
WHAT DATES?

21:40.400 --> 21:43.733
WHEN I DO THE MATH, THE FIRST
DATE I KEEP COMING UP WITH

21:43.733 --> 21:47.407
IS OCTOBER 6, 2009...

21:47.407 --> 21:49.939
THE DATE OF THE BLACKOUT.

21:51.881 --> 21:53.883
(telephone rings, beep)

21:53.883 --> 21:56.986
JANIS HAWK.
It's Benford. Get Wedeck.
Suspects are on the move.

21:56.986 --> 21:59.989
MARK, I'M PUTTING YOU
ON SPEAKER.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

21:59.989 --> 22:02.552
KHALID, OMAR

22:02.552 --> 22:05.024
AND AN UNIDENTIFIED
CAUCASIAN WOMAN.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.657
We're e-mailing you
pictures right now.
WHO IS SHE?

22:07.657 --> 22:09.699
Uh, that's the "unidentified"
part, sweetheart.

22:09.699 --> 22:12.962
GET THESE TO DIGITAL FORENSICS
AND RUN 'EM BY I.S.O.
OKAY.

22:12.962 --> 22:14.964
THANKS.

22:36.686 --> 22:39.789
(whoosh)
(woman) YOU'VE HAD A PARTIAL
ABRUPTION, MS. HAWK.

22:39.789 --> 22:42.632
THE GOOD NEWS IS
YOU'VE STOPPED BLEEDING.

22:42.632 --> 22:45.364
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALLY
WATCH YOUR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY

22:45.364 --> 22:49.499
FROM HERE ON OUT. DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE SEX OF YOUR BABY?
WELL, CONSIDERING
THE CIRCUMSTANCES...

22:49.499 --> 22:51.501
(whoosh)

22:51.501 --> 22:54.504
(crashing,
sirens wailing in distance)

22:54.504 --> 22:58.878
(explosions in distance,
indistinct conversations)

22:58.878 --> 23:01.050
(man) GET UP.
(woman coughs)

23:01.050 --> 23:03.853
(man) YOU GUYS OKAY?
(man) YEAH.

23:03.853 --> 23:06.456
(indistinct conversations)

23:06.456 --> 23:08.017
(groans, panting)

23:08.017 --> 23:10.990
(crashing)

23:30.910 --> 23:33.913
(sirens continue wailing,
people continue shouting)

23:42.752 --> 23:45.755
(coughing, retching)

23:48.898 --> 23:50.900
(toilet flushes)

23:50.900 --> 23:52.902
(crying)

23:56.936 --> 24:00.740
(helicopter whirring,
sirens wailing)

24:00.740 --> 24:04.073
(door bells chime)
I WANT OUT.

24:04.073 --> 24:06.676
IT'S NORMAL TO BE UPSET.

24:06.676 --> 24:08.948
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DIED
YESTERDAY, CARLINE.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.150
I LOST FRIENDS,
PEOPLE I KNOW AND WORK WITH.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.053
NOBODY TOLD ME THIS WAS
THE PLAN WHEN I WAS RECRUITED.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.055
YOU SAID THERE WAS
GONNA BE AN EVENT,

24:16.055 --> 24:18.457
BUT YOU NEVER SAID
IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.459
DID YOU KNOW THIS
WAS GONNA HAPPEN?

24:20.459 --> 24:23.793
I DON'T ANSWER QUESTIONS, JANIS.
WE'VE ALREADY BEEN OVER THIS.

24:23.793 --> 24:25.795
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS
ANYMORE.

24:25.795 --> 24:27.797
I WANT OUT NOW.

24:27.797 --> 24:30.469
I'M REALLY SORRY
YOU FEEL THAT WAY, JANIS,

24:30.469 --> 24:33.002
BUT YOU CAN'T GET OUT.

24:33.002 --> 24:35.144
YOU'RE IN WAY TOO DEEP.

24:35.144 --> 24:38.077
SURELY YOU'RE BRIGHT ENOUGH
TO REALIZE THAT.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.479
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.
I NEVER HEARD YOU COMPLAINING

24:40.479 --> 24:42.251
WHEN YOU WERE POCKETING
ALL THAT MONEY.

24:42.251 --> 24:45.154
YOU DIDN'T THINK
THERE WAS A PRICE?
YOU'RE A DESPICABLE PERSON.

24:45.154 --> 24:47.016
MAN UP, SWEETHEART.

24:47.016 --> 24:50.089
THIS IS WHAT WE DO, AND EVEN
IF I WANTED TO CUT YOU LOOSE,

24:50.089 --> 24:52.091
THAT'S NOT MY CALL TO MAKE.

24:52.091 --> 24:55.194
OKAY, THEN I WANT TO TALK TO
THE PERSON WHOSE CALL IT IS.

24:55.194 --> 24:58.227
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN...
EVER.

25:01.571 --> 25:05.004
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D GO ON HOME,

25:05.004 --> 25:07.506
POUR YOURSELF
A COUPLE OF STIFF ONES,

25:07.506 --> 25:10.079
LICK YOUR WOUNDS,
BECAUSE TOMORROW I EXPECT YOU

25:10.079 --> 25:12.081
BACK IN HERE
SPILLING YOUR GUTS.

25:23.953 --> 25:26.225
(bird caws)

25:33.863 --> 25:37.737
IT'S LIKE THE SETTING IN ONE
OF THOSE SLASHER MOVIES.
(chuckles)

25:37.737 --> 25:40.009
I'M MORE OF A CLINT EASTWOOD
TYPE GUY, MYSELF.

25:40.009 --> 25:41.941
I HOPE YOU TOLD SOMEONE
WHERE WE WERE GOING.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.574
AH, SO THEY'LL KNOW
WHERE TO FIND OUR BODIES?

25:44.574 --> 25:46.145
MM-HMM.

25:51.621 --> 25:53.022
(exhales deeply)

25:55.054 --> 25:57.687
OOH. HERE YOU GO.

25:57.687 --> 25:59.328
OH, THANK YOU.

25:59.328 --> 26:00.930
(clicks)

26:06.696 --> 26:09.198
MM. (sniffs, whistles)

26:11.971 --> 26:13.973
MILDEW.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.617
I'M GONNA LOOK AROUND
DOWN HERE.

26:27.617 --> 26:30.189
OKAY. YOU CALL ME
IF YOU GET LOST.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.721
(clicks)

26:58.017 --> 27:00.019
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND...
(gasps)

27:00.019 --> 27:02.391
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
THERE, OLIVIA.

27:04.794 --> 27:07.296
I KNEW YOU'D BE HERE.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.130
YOU'RE ALWAYS HERE.

27:16.205 --> 27:18.768
I'M HEADING OUT.

27:18.768 --> 27:20.740
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

27:20.740 --> 27:24.413
HMM? YOU'VE BEEN DISTRACTED.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN YOURSELF.

27:24.413 --> 27:26.415
YOU'VE BEEN COMING IN LATE,

27:26.415 --> 27:28.678
DISAPPEARING
FOR LENGTHS OF TIME.

27:28.678 --> 27:30.780
WHAT IS IT?

27:37.256 --> 27:40.289
(sighs)

27:42.161 --> 27:46.035
I'M PREGNANT.

27:46.035 --> 27:49.999
WOW.

27:49.999 --> 27:52.942
THAT'S...

27:52.942 --> 27:56.105
CONGRATULATIONS.

27:56.105 --> 27:58.878
YOUR FLASH-FORWARD
REALLY IS COMING TRUE.

27:58.878 --> 28:05.414
AND THERE WAS A QUESTION
OF THE HEALTH OF THE BABY.

28:05.414 --> 28:07.987
SO I JUST...

28:07.987 --> 28:10.219
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS I JUST LOST IT.

28:10.219 --> 28:12.822
I LOST MY EDGE.

28:12.822 --> 28:15.694
BUT I'M OKAY.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.168
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

28:19.168 --> 28:21.100
GREAT.

28:21.100 --> 28:24.974
MARK, I JUST HOPE THAT YOU KNOW
YOU CAN STILL COUNT ON ME.

28:24.974 --> 28:27.276
JANIS...

28:27.276 --> 28:29.779
I NEVER DOUBTED THAT.

28:31.280 --> 28:33.282
THANKS.

28:35.785 --> 28:40.950
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT FROST'S LAST WORDS--

28:40.950 --> 28:43.993
"IN THE END, YOU'LL BE SAVED BY
THE LADY YOU SEE EVERY DAY."

28:43.993 --> 28:45.995
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN, HMM?

28:45.995 --> 28:49.258
WELL, CLEARLY, THAT MEANS
I'M GONNA SAVE YOUR ASS, MARK.

28:49.258 --> 28:51.160
NO.

28:51.160 --> 28:55.164
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT MEANS
OLIVIA'S GONNA SAVE MY ASS.

28:55.164 --> 28:57.466
LET'S GO OVER THIS AGAIN.

28:57.466 --> 28:59.468
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT DYSON FROST?

28:59.468 --> 29:02.511
WE KNOW HE WENT
UNDER THE ALIAS "D. GIBBONS."

29:02.511 --> 29:04.343
AND HE PLAYED CHESS
BRILLIANTLY.

29:04.343 --> 29:07.046
AND FAKED HIS OWN DEATH
ONCE UPON A TIME.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.849
(Demetri) D. GIBBONS ESCAPED.
WE GOT A WHITE QUEEN.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.753
CHESS...

29:14.753 --> 29:15.925
(chuckles)

29:15.925 --> 29:18.828
THE LADY YOU SEE EVERY DAY.

29:18.828 --> 29:20.990
(chuckles)

29:20.990 --> 29:23.262
IN CHESS,

29:23.262 --> 29:25.835
THE QUEEN'S KNOWN
AS THE LADY, RIGHT?

29:31.100 --> 29:33.042
NO.

29:39.979 --> 29:43.282
(shatters)

29:52.862 --> 29:56.966
CRAZY SON OF A BITCH
WAS RIGHT.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.440
YOUR FAMILY?

30:11.440 --> 30:14.884
I'M TAKING YOU
WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.

30:14.884 --> 30:18.948
WHAT ELSE
DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
HOW ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW?
THAT'S A START.

30:18.948 --> 30:22.051
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER--
WE'RE IN A CAR TOGETHER.

30:22.051 --> 30:25.324
WE BLACK OUT. THE CAR
GOES OVER THE EMBANKMENT.

30:25.324 --> 30:29.929
I SURVIVE. IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT I SAW.

30:29.929 --> 30:33.903
A FUTURE WITHOUT THEM
IS NO FUTURE AT ALL.

30:33.903 --> 30:36.005
I'M SORRY.

30:38.067 --> 30:39.909
YOU KNOW,

30:39.909 --> 30:44.974
I ENVY THAT YOU BELIEVE
IN THE POSSIBILITY OF GOOD.

30:59.488 --> 31:01.090
(shouts
in Middle Eastern language)

31:04.163 --> 31:06.335
(shouts in
Middle Eastern language)

31:06.335 --> 31:08.998
TALIBAN?

31:08.998 --> 31:12.601
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU KNEW ALL THE FACTIONS.

31:12.601 --> 31:16.605
ISN'T THAT WHY WEDECK
SENT YOU TO ME?
I DON'T KNOW THIS ONE.

31:16.605 --> 31:18.307
(shouts in
Middle Eastern language)

31:18.307 --> 31:20.479
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

31:20.479 --> 31:23.352
(shouts in
Middle Eastern language)

31:25.084 --> 31:26.485
(cocks gun)
(shouts in
Middle Eastern language)

31:26.485 --> 31:27.987
(grunts)

31:57.286 --> 32:00.919
(grenade whistles)

32:00.919 --> 32:03.352
(indistinct shouting)

32:33.552 --> 32:35.554
(gun cocks)

32:49.268 --> 32:52.001
KHAMIR?

32:52.001 --> 32:54.703
(exhales)
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

32:54.703 --> 32:56.705
WELL, YOU...

32:56.705 --> 32:59.178
DON'T BLEND IN
AS WELL AS YOU THINK.

33:04.013 --> 33:06.315
MY--MY FRIEND--
THE ONE WHO TEXTED YOU--

33:06.315 --> 33:09.118
HE--HE WAS HERE.
WE--WE WERE HERE.
(Vreede) OLIVIA!

33:09.118 --> 33:12.461
WE WERE HERE. HE WAS HERE.
WE--WE WERE HERE TOGETHER.
YOU OKAY?

33:12.461 --> 33:15.464
YEAH.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW?
TELL--YOU UNDERSTAND NOW?

33:15.464 --> 33:17.466
NO, GABRIEL,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

33:17.466 --> 33:21.030
HOW--HOW DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE CAR ACCIDENT

33:21.030 --> 33:23.232
AT THE HOSPITAL?
I SAW IT.

33:23.232 --> 33:25.234
WELL, WHAT DID YOU MEAN
WHEN YOU SAID

33:25.234 --> 33:27.736
THAT I MADE A MISTAKE
ABOUT LLOYD?
UH, IT'S WHAT I SAW.

33:27.736 --> 33:30.109
(singsong voice)
LLOYD AND OLIVIA SITTING

33:30.109 --> 33:33.312
IN A TREE, K-I-S-S--
OKAY, STOP. STOP.

33:33.312 --> 33:37.116
(normal voice)
IT'S WHAT I SAW.
YOU SAW IT?

33:39.488 --> 33:42.551
THIS IS WHERE THEY DID IT.
GABRIEL,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

33:42.551 --> 33:44.553
THIS IS WHERE THEY DID IT.

33:49.298 --> 33:52.301
THIS IS WHERE THEY DID IT.

33:52.301 --> 33:54.303
(Olivia)
WHERE THEY DID WHAT?

33:54.303 --> 33:58.107
THIS IS WHERE THEY DID IT...
THE EXPERIMENTS.

33:58.107 --> 34:00.239
(Olivia) WHAT EXPERIMENTS?

34:00.239 --> 34:03.041
EVERY OTHER DAY
FOR TWO YEARS...

34:03.041 --> 34:05.114
WE CAME HERE.

34:05.114 --> 34:08.147
THEY PUT US TO SLEEP.

34:08.147 --> 34:11.350
(voices
whispering indistinctly)

34:11.350 --> 34:15.184
THEY PUT US TO SLEEP.
I NEVER KNEW WHERE I'D END UP.

34:15.184 --> 34:18.087
SOMETIMES IT WAS A SHORT TRIP.
(grunting)

34:18.087 --> 34:23.232
I WAS EATING A TUNA SANDWICH.
CAT JUMPED ON THE TABLE.

34:23.232 --> 34:26.064
KITTY LIKES TUNA.
SOMETIMES IT WAS A LONG TRIP.

34:26.064 --> 34:29.838
HE WATCHES FROM THERE.

34:29.838 --> 34:31.740
WHO?

34:31.740 --> 34:34.803
THE DOCTOR... FROST.

34:34.803 --> 34:37.746
(voices continue
whispering indistinctly)

34:37.746 --> 34:39.448
DYSON FROST?

34:45.214 --> 34:47.816
HE TOLD US WE WERE SPECIAL

34:47.816 --> 34:51.320
'CAUSE WE COULD
REMEMBER THINGS...

34:51.320 --> 34:53.822
EVERYTHING.

34:53.822 --> 34:56.695
AND THEN WHEN WE CAME BACK,
WE HAD TO WRITE IT ALL DOWN,

34:56.695 --> 35:00.098
EVERY--EVERY LITTLE DETAIL.

35:00.098 --> 35:03.101
THAT'S THE WAY
THE COOKIE CRUMBLES. THE...

35:03.101 --> 35:04.873
FLASH-FORWARDS?

35:04.873 --> 35:09.178
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
FLASH-FORWARDS.

35:09.178 --> 35:11.180
HE--HE SAID WE WERE SPECIAL

35:11.180 --> 35:13.412
BECAUSE WE COULD
REMEMBER THE FUTURE.

35:13.412 --> 35:16.715
I SAID THAT ALREADY.
DID I SAY THAT ALREADY?

35:16.715 --> 35:20.689
I'M SORRY I SAID THAT ALREADY.
I SAID THAT ALREADY.
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY,
GABRIEL. IT'S OKAY.

35:20.689 --> 35:24.153
YOU ARE SPECIAL. YOU'RE--
YOU'RE A SAVANT. YOU ALL WERE.

35:24.153 --> 35:26.124
HE USED YOU
FOR YOUR EIDETIC MEMORIES

35:26.124 --> 35:28.427
LIKE HUMAN RECORDERS.

35:28.427 --> 35:31.600
WHEN THEY FINISHED WITH US...

35:31.600 --> 35:34.132
WHEN THEY USED US ALL UP...

35:36.335 --> 35:40.639
HE TOLD THEM TO KILL US
SO WE WOULDN'T TELL.

35:40.639 --> 35:44.243
HE'S DEAD NOW.

35:44.243 --> 35:49.178
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
AFRAID OF HIM ANYMORE.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.182
HUH.

35:53.182 --> 35:55.724
THE EARLY WORM
CATCHES THE BIRD.

35:55.724 --> 35:58.827
I'VE BEEN WAITING.
I'VE BEEN WAITING.

35:58.827 --> 36:01.290
GABRIEL, WHY HAVE YOU
BEEN FOLLOWING ME?

36:01.290 --> 36:03.292
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

36:03.292 --> 36:05.294
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY.

36:05.294 --> 36:07.766
SO I-I HAVE TO
TURN YOU AROUND, OLIVIA,

36:07.766 --> 36:10.869
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING
THE WRONG WAY.
WHAT WRONG WAY?

36:10.869 --> 36:14.573
IN THE FUTURES I SAW,
I ALWAYS SAW YOU, OLIVIA.
ME?

36:14.573 --> 36:16.745
YEAH, AND YOU'RE
ALWAYS WITH LLOYD.

36:16.745 --> 36:18.747
AT HARVARD, BY THE PIPE SHOP,

36:18.747 --> 36:21.850
I-I TRIED TO SMOKE THAT DAY,
BUT I THREW UP.

36:21.850 --> 36:24.213
AND--AND WE WERE FRIENDS.

36:24.213 --> 36:26.855
WE WERE FRIENDS BECAUSE I WAS
THE JANITOR IN THE--
NO, GABRIEL.
I DIDN'T GO TO HARVARD.

36:26.855 --> 36:29.718
I CAME TO CALIFORNIA. I WENT
TO U.C.L.A. I MARRIED MARK.

36:29.718 --> 36:31.720
IN THE FUTURES I SAW,

36:31.720 --> 36:34.192
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
WITH LLOYD.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.895
YOU'RE ALWAYS WITH LLOYD--
NOT THAT OTHER ONE.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.897
LLOYD. (sniffs)

36:38.897 --> 36:40.869
HARVARD WAS A FORK
IN THE ROAD.

36:40.869 --> 36:42.971
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME,
OLIVIA.

36:42.971 --> 36:45.404
YOU HAVE TO--HAVE
TO REMEMBER THESE THINGS,

36:45.404 --> 36:48.206
BECAUSE THEY'RE IMPORTANT.
YOU HAVE TO BE HERE

36:48.206 --> 36:51.510
FOR THINGS TO COME.
YOU'RE A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.512
THEY--THEY CAN'T SOLVE IT
WITHOUT YOU!

37:01.950 --> 37:04.953
GENTLEMEN,
IT'S BEEN P.E.T. SCANNED,

37:04.953 --> 37:07.856
C.T. SCANNED

37:07.856 --> 37:10.329
AND SUBJECTED
TO NEUTRON EMISSIONS ANALYSIS.

37:10.329 --> 37:11.900
WHAT THE HELL IS IT--

37:11.900 --> 37:14.263
SOME KIND OF LITTLE
ELECTRONIC KRYPTONITE?

37:14.263 --> 37:17.235
NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS MORE COMPLICATED.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.538
OUR ANALYST IS SAYING
IT MAKES OUR CURRENT TECH

37:19.538 --> 37:22.010
LOOK KIND OF PRIMITIVE.
THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.

37:22.010 --> 37:24.943
THAT'S WHY I'VE INVITED
SIMON AND LLOYD TO JOIN US.
(beeps)

37:24.943 --> 37:28.747
SUSPECT ZERO HAS ONE, TOO.
YOU THINK HE AND DYSON FROST
WERE WORKING TOGETHER, HUH?

37:28.747 --> 37:30.749
POSSIBLY. WE KNOW
THAT D. GIBBONS--FROST--

37:30.749 --> 37:32.721
MADE NUMEROUS CALLS
DURING THE BLACKOUT.

37:32.721 --> 37:35.754
AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THEY WERE
THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

37:35.754 --> 37:37.926
AWAKE DURING THE BLACKOUT.

37:37.926 --> 37:40.459
SUSPECT ZERO
WAS WEARING A RING,

37:40.459 --> 37:43.592
AND FROST HAD THIS ONE
IN HIS POSSESSION.

37:46.935 --> 37:48.937
IT'S A Q.E.D.

37:48.937 --> 37:52.941
WHAT?
A QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT DEVICE.

37:52.941 --> 37:55.704
MY GOD. IT EXISTS.

37:55.704 --> 37:58.977
THIS IS WHAT WE WERE DISCUSSING
IN OUR FLASH-FORWARDS.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.949
ENGLISH, GENTLEMEN.
ENGLISH, PLEASE.

38:00.949 --> 38:03.712
OKAY. LET'S START WITH
THE BASICS, ALL RIGHT?

38:03.712 --> 38:06.014
THEORETICALLY,
FROST AND HIS PALS

38:06.014 --> 38:08.016
RAMPED UP
OUR LINEAR ACCELERATOR

38:08.016 --> 38:09.988
TO SUCH EXTREME ENERGIES
THAT IT SENT SHOCK WAVES

38:09.988 --> 38:12.861
THROUGH THE CONSCIOUSNESS FIELD

38:12.861 --> 38:14.863
AND JOLTED
ALL OF HUMANITY'S AWARENESS

38:14.863 --> 38:17.366
TO A DIFFERENT PLACE IN
SPACE-TIME--THE FLASH-FORWARD.

38:17.366 --> 38:19.928
NOW SUSPECT ZERO AND FROST

38:19.928 --> 38:23.071
WERE AWAKE DURING THE TIME
OF THE BLACKOUT, CORRECT?

38:23.071 --> 38:26.735
THEY WERE IN SOME WAY PROTECTED.
CLEARLY.
SO YOU THINK THIS RING--

38:26.735 --> 38:28.737
IS A DEVICE
WHICH ANCHORED THEIR MINDS

38:28.737 --> 38:30.979
TO THEIR CURRENT LOCATION
IN SPACE-TIME.

38:30.979 --> 38:34.012
IN OTHER WORDS,
IT HELPED THEM STAY CONSCIOUS.
YOU'RE SAYING
THIS LITTLE THING

38:34.012 --> 38:37.716
KEPT THOSE GUYS
FROM BLACKING OUT?

38:37.716 --> 38:40.849
MAYBE THIS IS WHY THEY WERE
SO ANXIOUS TO ATTACK OUR OFFICES

38:40.849 --> 38:42.521
ON APRIL 29th.

38:42.521 --> 38:45.494
MAYBE THEY WEREN'T COMING FOR
ME. THEY WERE COMING FOR THIS.

38:45.494 --> 38:47.496
AND NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT,

38:47.496 --> 38:50.659
WE CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO STOP THEM.

39:00.008 --> 39:03.011
(dishes clattering)

39:06.915 --> 39:09.378
MR. VOGEL?

39:09.378 --> 39:10.949
JANIS HAWK.

39:10.949 --> 39:14.753
I WAS TOLD TO MEET YOU BY
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR BRAMWELL.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.124
YES, MS. HAWK.

39:16.124 --> 39:17.886
PLEASE SIT.

39:22.531 --> 39:25.464
CONGRATULATIONS
ON GRADUATING TODAY.

39:25.464 --> 39:28.897
SURVIVING QUANTICO IS
NO SMALL ACCOMPLISHMENT.

39:28.897 --> 39:30.639
THANK YOU.

39:30.639 --> 39:34.403
I WAS TOLD THIS IS
ABOUT A SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT,

39:34.403 --> 39:38.477
BUT I'M ACTUALLY STARTING
IN THE L.A. OFFICE NEXT MONTH.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.879
MS. HAWK, I'LL GET RIGHT
TO THE POINT.

39:40.879 --> 39:44.052
I'M NOT WITH THE BUREAU.
AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE,

39:44.052 --> 39:46.555
HISTORICALLY, THE BUREAU
AND THE AGENCY HAVEN'T ALWAYS

39:46.555 --> 39:48.617
COOPERATED AS CLOSELY
AS THEY MIGHT HAVE.

39:48.617 --> 39:50.889
WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE THAT.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.991
YOU'RE CIA.

39:52.991 --> 39:56.865
HMM. AS A PART OF
A STILL-CLASSIFIED OPERATION,

39:56.865 --> 39:59.397
WE'VE ASSESSED
YOUR GRADUATING CLASS

39:59.397 --> 40:02.000
AND FOUND
HALF A DOZEN CANDIDATES

40:02.000 --> 40:05.403
POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE
TO HOSTILE RECRUITMENT.
AND I'M ONE OF THEM?

40:05.403 --> 40:08.777
YES. YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION,
YOUR SEXUAL ORIENTATION,

40:08.777 --> 40:10.939
YOUR UNCONVENTIONAL
UPBRINGING--

40:10.939 --> 40:14.713
THEY ALL MAKE YOU
A POTENTIAL TARGET.
WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU'RE WRONG.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.715
I WOULD NEVER BETRAY
MY COUNTRY.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.717
I WOULD NEVER
BETRAY A FELLOW AGENT.

40:18.717 --> 40:23.792
YOU HAVE THE WRONG PERSON,
AGENT.
WE KNOW. WE KNOW.
WE'VE DONE OUR HOMEWORK.

40:23.792 --> 40:25.794
YOUR REPUTATION
AMONGST YOUR CLASSMATES

40:25.794 --> 40:27.756
AND YOUR INSTRUCTORS
IS IMPECCABLE,

40:27.756 --> 40:30.058
AND BRAMWELL SAYS YOU'RE
ONE OF THE FINEST STUDENTS

40:30.058 --> 40:31.760
HE'S SEEN IN YEARS.

40:31.760 --> 40:34.503
OH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WE NEED A DANGLE.

40:34.503 --> 40:36.665
WE KNOW SOMETHING BIG
IS GOING DOWN--

40:36.665 --> 40:39.968
SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE 9/11
LOOK LIKE A FENDER BENDER.

40:39.968 --> 40:43.441
WE NEED SOMEONE
ON THE INSIDE.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.944
NOW WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT AN ORGANIZATION

40:45.944 --> 40:48.577
MAY APPROACH YOU SOON
AND ASK YOU TO BE A MOLE

40:48.577 --> 40:50.579
IN THE L.A. OFFICE.

40:50.579 --> 40:53.922
WE... WANT YOU TO SAY YES.

40:53.922 --> 40:56.755
YOU WANT ME TO BE
A DOUBLE AGENT?

40:56.755 --> 40:58.887
YES.

40:58.887 --> 41:02.460
WOW.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.233
I'M NOT GONNA KID YOU, JANIS.
IT WON'T BE EASY.

41:05.233 --> 41:07.996
THEY'LL MANIPULATE YOU.
THEY'LL USE YOU IN WAYS

41:07.996 --> 41:11.039
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE.
(crying)

41:11.039 --> 41:14.773
YOU'LL KNOW THINGS, BUT YOU
WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL ANYONE.

41:14.773 --> 41:16.745
YOU'LL BE IN CONSTANT DANGER.

41:16.745 --> 41:20.078
YOU'LL BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS,
AND THERE MAY COME A TIME

41:20.078 --> 41:23.552
WHEN THEY ASK YOU TO DO
SOMETHING WHICH GOES AGAINST

41:23.552 --> 41:25.714
EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE IN
AND CARE ABOUT.

41:25.714 --> 41:28.857
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT
TO WIN THEIR TRUST

41:28.857 --> 41:30.919
AND STAY ON THE INSIDE.

41:30.919 --> 41:33.061
DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF DOING

41:33.061 --> 41:35.894
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO?
(sips)

41:38.166 --> 41:41.199
SO THEY HAVE THE RING.

41:41.199 --> 41:44.733
IT'S BEEN ON MARK'S BOARD
SINCE UTAH.
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GET IT BACK.

41:44.733 --> 41:47.676
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?
IT'S IN A WELL-FORTIFIED VAULT

41:47.676 --> 41:49.908
IN THE BASEMENT OF THE FBI,
FOR GOD SAKES.

41:49.908 --> 41:53.241
YOU KEEP ASKING ME TO DO
THIS IMPOSSIBLE STUFF,

41:53.241 --> 41:55.243
I'M GONNA BLOW MY COVER.

41:55.243 --> 41:57.716
I KNOW YOU'VE GROWN
TO LIKE THESE PEOPLE.

41:57.716 --> 41:59.718
THEY'RE LIKE FAMILY TO YOU,

41:59.718 --> 42:02.220
AND THIS UNDERSTANDABLY
IS HARD FOR YOU.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.923
BUT YOU FAILED TO FOLLOW
BENFORD TO FROST,

42:04.923 --> 42:06.895
AND YOU FAILED IN DESTROYING
THE BLUEPRINTS,

42:06.895 --> 42:08.957
WHICH WAS MOST UNFORTUNATE.

42:08.957 --> 42:12.661
I WOULD NOT MAKE
A THIRD MISTAKE, JANIS.

42:12.661 --> 42:14.663
THIS IS WHERE
YOU GET TO PROVE

42:14.663 --> 42:16.735
YOUR DEDICATION
TO THE CAUSE, DARLIN'.

42:18.807 --> 42:20.809
I'LL GET THE RING.

42:20.809 --> 42:24.012
OH, AND, JANIS,
ONE MORE THING.

42:24.012 --> 42:26.945
WE NEED YOU TO KILL BENFORD.
