WEBVTT

00:00.950 --> 00:02.721
We are only to happy

00:02.746 --> 00:05.138
to receive Rome's favored son.

00:05.299 --> 00:06.982
The manufacture of armaments

00:07.007 --> 00:09.131
could be construed as
a provocative move.

00:09.136 --> 00:11.672
I believe there may be a spy
in my court.

00:11.741 --> 00:13.483
If we have something
to convey to you,

00:13.508 --> 00:17.202
we will inscribe
the letter Omega.

00:17.348 --> 00:20.690
Tell your Pope that
neither Florence

00:20.715 --> 00:23.451
nor Da Vinci
will be contained.

00:25.523 --> 00:27.591
Whatever lock
this corresponds with,

00:27.658 --> 00:31.062
I'd wager the key represents
only half.

00:31.130 --> 00:33.031
The key is useless
without its counterpart.

00:33.099 --> 00:35.367
Have you heard of
the Book of Leaves?

00:35.435 --> 00:37.770
It's a myth.
No more real than a unicorn.

00:37.838 --> 00:41.375
You and Salviati should assemble
the largest army you can find.

00:41.443 --> 00:45.012
Get to work, maestro.
Florence is counting on you.

Shall we?

02:28.962 --> 02:33.266
I find the game fascinating.

02:33.334 --> 02:36.237
Deceptively simple,
isn't it?

02:37.272 --> 02:39.974
I have a repast.

02:40.042 --> 02:42.076
Say it.

02:42.144 --> 02:45.380
Panpepato, cheese, and wine.

02:45.447 --> 02:47.115
You made the panpepato?

02:47.183 --> 02:49.684
Yes. Because you like it.

03:02.764 --> 03:05.299
- Was that Amharic?
- Yes.

03:05.366 --> 03:08.836
I spent time in Abyssinia.

03:08.903 --> 03:11.572
I said that you hold her
in high regard.

03:11.640 --> 03:17.712
She labors hard and has embraced
both the Lord and our language.

03:17.780 --> 03:20.047
You taught her,
didn't you?

03:20.115 --> 03:26.588
I did. Just as you teach me this
game with patient persistence.

03:26.655 --> 03:29.557
Now, shall we get to play?

03:29.624 --> 03:30.825
That's the thing.

03:30.893 --> 03:32.527
I've yet to touch the board

03:32.594 --> 03:35.263
but already I've begun.

03:38.033 --> 03:41.669
The first principle
is to take the corners.

03:41.737 --> 03:43.437
The strategy is obvious.

03:43.505 --> 03:46.507
The corners are easier
to defend.

03:50.646 --> 03:54.549
It's brilliant.
High grade, beautifully milled.

03:54.617 --> 03:56.718
But it's missing something.

03:56.786 --> 04:00.722
I know! A jaunty bobbin lace
is what it needs.

04:00.789 --> 04:04.892
<i>But even as we engage in</i>
<i>localized conflicts</i>

04:04.960 --> 04:09.964
<i>it is important to keep the</i>
<i>broader landscape in mind.</i>

04:21.310 --> 04:23.912
The game can only be won
by pursuing

04:23.980 --> 04:29.084
seemingly opposing objectives
simultaneously.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.394
<i>At any given moment.</i>

04:39.461 --> 04:42.730
Lucrezia, my dear,
come tell us what you think.

04:42.798 --> 04:46.601
<i>- A stone can be considered to</i>-

04:46.669 --> 04:50.705
<i>alive, dead,</i>
<i>or unsettled.</i>

04:50.773 --> 04:52.840
Lucrezia can you come out here,
dear?

04:52.908 --> 04:55.743
<i>An unsettled stone</i>
<i>naturally presents the player</i>

04:55.811 --> 04:59.947
with the largest
potential outcomes.

05:01.783 --> 05:04.051
- Are you heading out?
- Yes.

05:04.118 --> 05:06.120
- After curfew?
- I'll be fine.

05:06.187 --> 05:08.522
- Is that wise?
- I'm calling on Ginevra.

05:08.589 --> 05:11.891
I bought some herbs from the
montebianchi to treat her tetter.

05:11.959 --> 05:13.693
But I may need your help.

05:13.761 --> 05:17.264
I'm confident that Enzo is capable
of handling all of your needs.

05:17.331 --> 05:18.766
Goodnight.

05:18.833 --> 05:21.969
An opponent who can control
the flow of the game

05:22.037 --> 05:24.138
while appearing to play
defensively

05:24.206 --> 05:28.376
is often the most formidable.

05:32.447 --> 05:35.049
Go on. Move on.

05:40.421 --> 05:43.223
Come on! Stand up straight.

05:56.772 --> 05:58.573
Go on. Move on.

06:19.795 --> 06:21.229
Look down here on the left.

06:31.507 --> 06:35.176
- Signora Donati.
- Captain Dragonetti.

06:35.244 --> 06:38.413
Isn't it late for a woman of your
standing to be out for a stroll?

06:38.481 --> 06:41.383
On principle, I could arrest
you for violating curfew.

06:41.450 --> 06:45.220
True. But we both know that
it would be you, and not I,

06:45.287 --> 06:47.088
who would receive punishment.

06:49.192 --> 06:51.259
Enjoy the evening air, Signora.

07:05.609 --> 07:07.809
- Good evening, Gualberto.
- Signora.

07:07.877 --> 07:09.511
You look lovely
this evening.

07:09.579 --> 07:12.180
- As always.
- Thank you.

07:19.889 --> 07:23.391
- Your heart is racing.
- I didn't expect you to be here.

07:26.162 --> 07:28.497
I couldn't wait for you
any longer at the palazzo.

07:32.569 --> 07:35.204
Lorenzo.

07:35.271 --> 07:36.539
Let me.

08:29.359 --> 08:33.596
One of the most difficult
strategies to master is called...

08:33.664 --> 08:36.231
"Cross The Sea Unseen".

08:36.299 --> 08:38.000
- Da Vinci!

08:38.068 --> 08:42.104
It entails identifying the
weakness in an opponent's position

08:42.172 --> 08:45.507
and exploiting it
beneath their notice.

08:48.678 --> 08:52.348
Da Vinci! Lorenzo believes you
are already at the forge!

08:55.285 --> 08:56.753
Da Vinci!

09:02.427 --> 09:03.527
What?

09:03.595 --> 09:05.329
Why weren't you there
at first light?

09:05.396 --> 09:06.964
They cast guns at sunrise.

09:07.031 --> 09:09.166
I don't have to pour
the metal myself, Becchi.

09:09.234 --> 09:11.202
These weapons are vital
to Florence's safety

09:11.270 --> 09:14.205
and you've sold
yourself as a war engineer.

09:14.273 --> 09:16.541
- What is that noxious smell?
- It's an experiment.

09:16.609 --> 09:18.576
I'm assessing the implications
of my guns.

09:20.747 --> 09:22.781
Da Vinci!

09:43.203 --> 09:44.203
Da Vinci!

09:44.271 --> 09:47.039
Ah, there you are, Maestro.

09:47.107 --> 09:49.875
Production progressing
smoothly, I trust?

09:49.942 --> 09:53.746
As smoothly as can be expected,
given these working conditions.

09:53.813 --> 09:58.083
Yes, but my guns. We will
have ten, as promised, yes?

09:58.151 --> 10:01.120
Our refusal to accept Rome's
Archbishop of Pisa

10:01.187 --> 10:03.789
only reinforces the need
to bolster our defenses.

10:03.857 --> 10:07.793
I am acutely aware of the pressures
converging on His Magnificence.

10:09.162 --> 10:11.597
What the devil is that
cloudy-eyed miscreant doing?

10:11.665 --> 10:15.434
- The tonality is off.
- Stop!

10:15.502 --> 10:19.938
Our sightless friend's keen ears
have detected an impurity.

10:20.807 --> 10:24.075
This is absurd.

10:24.142 --> 10:25.843
Your methods,
what's changed?

10:25.911 --> 10:28.880
Nothing. I've used
the finest ore, as dictated.

10:28.948 --> 10:31.382
- Well, then, the heat...
- Precisely as instructed.

10:31.450 --> 10:34.285
Well, there was that one moment
when we ran out of sulfur.

10:34.353 --> 10:36.988
- Why wasn't I consulted?
- It was incidental.

10:37.056 --> 10:40.224
What exactly is the issue here?

10:40.292 --> 10:42.059
If they've used
an inferior alloy,

10:42.127 --> 10:44.028
in this case,
too little sulfur,

10:44.096 --> 10:47.064
then the sound the guns make will
be half as loud as they should be.

10:47.132 --> 10:49.567
Who cares about
the fucking sound?

10:49.635 --> 10:51.769
We're not doing more
of your goddamn theatre.

10:51.837 --> 10:53.771
They need to obliterate
the enemy.

10:53.839 --> 10:56.140
Blow them to bits.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.676
- Please unhand me.
- Or what?

10:58.743 --> 11:00.344
You're threatening me
with a spoon now?

11:00.412 --> 11:01.812
Giuliano!

11:06.853 --> 11:08.720
As I was saying,

11:08.788 --> 11:17.762
the timbre of the barrel is also
indicative of its general properties.

11:17.830 --> 11:19.264
Start again.

11:19.332 --> 11:21.733
Don't scrimp on the sulfur
this time!

11:21.801 --> 11:25.270
He won't.

11:25.338 --> 11:26.872
You treat me like a fool.

11:26.939 --> 11:30.108
But I'm capable of leading.

11:30.176 --> 11:32.410
- The people love me.
- They love your face.

11:32.478 --> 11:38.049
But that smooth nose of yours
won't keep Rome from striking.

11:38.117 --> 11:40.785
Only Da Vinci's guns will.

11:45.592 --> 11:47.192
Come, Nico.

11:47.260 --> 11:50.829
These Medici currency vouchers
are weighing me down.

11:50.897 --> 11:53.332
I need to fly,
be free of this world.

11:55.601 --> 11:57.970
How much for your entire
inventory?

11:58.037 --> 12:00.105
More than you gave
me last time.

12:00.173 --> 12:02.207
Two florins?

12:02.275 --> 12:03.809
How about it, bird man?

12:05.279 --> 12:07.213
A little help, Nico?

12:07.281 --> 12:08.581
Excuse me.

12:13.687 --> 12:15.021
Now!

12:35.041 --> 12:37.376
I never tire
of watching that.

12:43.583 --> 12:46.285
Why didn't this one fly away?

12:46.353 --> 12:48.454
Signor Da Vinci.

12:48.522 --> 12:50.455
When will you ever
finish my portrait

12:50.523 --> 12:53.692
if we sit together
so infrequently?

12:53.759 --> 12:57.596
Maestro, I'll pick up some
more eggs for your pigments.

12:57.663 --> 13:01.666
On your way to or
from Lorenzo, then?

13:01.734 --> 13:04.102
You know my situation,
Leonardo.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.741
Just go.

13:09.809 --> 13:11.810
This is your chance,

13:11.877 --> 13:15.380
the cage is open.

13:15.448 --> 13:16.848
Do you think your
pursuit of knowledge

13:16.916 --> 13:19.784
makes you immune
to your emotions?

13:19.852 --> 13:22.087
You can't outrun them,
you know.

13:23.456 --> 13:25.023
Do you know,
I'm not running.

13:25.091 --> 13:28.092
I just have
competing interests.

13:31.363 --> 13:33.264
Like you.

13:36.001 --> 13:38.737
Curious, that bird.

13:38.804 --> 13:40.505
And paid for.

13:40.573 --> 13:43.375
You take it or I eat it.

13:46.079 --> 13:48.547
<i>So, the plot thickens.</i>

13:48.615 --> 13:52.584
You've broken off from a local
exchange and opened up a new front.

13:52.652 --> 13:56.522
I thought it was time a little chaos
was introduced into the play.

14:00.893 --> 14:03.528
What's going on?

14:03.595 --> 14:05.195
Inside me...

14:05.263 --> 14:08.866
the... the... devil...

14:08.934 --> 14:12.635
..clawing at my womb,
damning me!

14:15.172 --> 14:16.439
Oh, dear God.

14:19.543 --> 14:20.844
It can't be.

14:20.912 --> 14:23.080
Don't touch her.
We don't know what afflicts her.

14:23.148 --> 14:25.282
It's Sister Dolores.
I knew her at the Convent.

14:25.350 --> 14:29.253
The sweetest,
most innocent soul. Dolores?

14:29.321 --> 14:32.690
You there. Find some officers,
bring them here.

14:32.757 --> 14:35.025
It's me - Vanessa.

14:36.728 --> 14:40.765
You, your brother, Lorenzo,
making a new Sodom,

14:40.833 --> 14:42.300
gorging on filth,

14:42.367 --> 14:44.969
spewing out sin
onto Florence's streets.

14:45.036 --> 14:47.137
The Lord hates you!

14:47.205 --> 14:49.973
- What has befallen this woman?
- Demons, signor.

14:50.041 --> 14:54.111
Five of our fellow sisters from the Convent
of St Anthony have been possessed.

14:55.513 --> 14:58.882
The Medicis - copulators,
blasphemers

14:58.950 --> 15:02.386
corrupting our city.

15:02.453 --> 15:06.422
My eyes burn to look at you!

15:06.490 --> 15:09.859
Ssh.

15:13.731 --> 15:16.866
You let a mad woman
seize your blade.

15:16.934 --> 15:19.636
I ought to kill you with it!

15:19.704 --> 15:21.304
Take her away.

15:21.372 --> 15:23.806
Carefully and with respect.

15:25.209 --> 15:28.412
The rest of you...
go home.

15:28.479 --> 15:29.946
Pray for her soul.

15:31.849 --> 15:34.417
Go on, go!

15:49.899 --> 15:51.653
What in God's name are you doing
with these bodies?

15:51.678 --> 15:53.447
Leonardo, they're beginning to putrefy.

15:55.839 --> 15:57.773
And the stench has carried
into my studio.

15:57.841 --> 16:01.844
Andrea, please, can you not see that
I'm trying to pursue something here?

16:01.912 --> 16:04.080
Now look at this,
look at this.

16:04.147 --> 16:08.083
Africa...and Europe. Here?

16:08.151 --> 16:12.120
- Yes.
- See how they fit into this.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.790
Europe and Africa,
here and here...

16:14.857 --> 16:16.491
..and the Jew's map.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.094
It can only be where there are
now two land masses,

16:19.162 --> 16:21.998
there once was just one.

16:25.436 --> 16:27.837
Drifted apart over ages.

16:30.040 --> 16:34.044
And between them,
the great Atlantic.

16:34.111 --> 16:37.948
The Book of Leaves
has to be here, Andrea...

16:38.015 --> 16:39.783
..on this land mass
to the West.

16:39.850 --> 16:44.587
But you don't even know that
this land mass actually exists.

16:44.655 --> 16:48.058
Ignis fatuus. That's what this
Sons of Mithras business is.

16:48.125 --> 16:49.859
"Foolish fire".

16:49.927 --> 16:53.196
Children chasing after luminous
insects, thinking them faerie lights

16:53.264 --> 16:56.100
and finding themselves
neck-deep in swamp-mire.

16:56.167 --> 16:58.702
- Well, I'm not a child, Andrea.
- Yet you pursue this folly

16:58.770 --> 17:01.939
while your legitimate
commissions languish.

17:04.041 --> 17:05.943
- Maestro! Maestro!
- Yes, what is it, boy?

17:06.011 --> 17:09.646
Signora Donati saw Vanessa
leaving for the Convent St Anthony.

17:09.714 --> 17:11.348
And your point is?

17:11.415 --> 17:13.584
Demons possess
the nuns there!

17:13.652 --> 17:16.153
I saw one of the sisters.
She stabbed her own eyes out!

17:16.221 --> 17:18.355
Vanessa can fall victim to
the demons too!

17:18.423 --> 17:20.691
Demons have yet to be proven
the cause of anything

17:20.758 --> 17:22.425
except some rather
tedious sermons.

17:22.492 --> 17:24.928
- We need to help her!
- Fuck, Nico!

17:24.994 --> 17:28.898
If I dropped everything to pursue some
ill-conceived and asinine flight of fancy,

17:28.966 --> 17:31.268
I would never
get anything done!

17:34.472 --> 17:36.673
Well, I'll remember that

17:36.741 --> 17:41.078
the next time you decide to strap me
or Vanessa into your glider wings.

17:57.562 --> 18:00.397
The violence of her movements,
her screeching,

18:00.465 --> 18:02.166
she seemed possessed, Lorenzo.

18:02.234 --> 18:03.701
My brother saw one mad nun

18:03.769 --> 18:05.704
and thinks the Devil
is at large in Florence.

18:05.771 --> 18:07.405
It's not just the one.

18:07.473 --> 18:09.040
They say the Devil's
influence is spreading,

18:09.108 --> 18:11.544
and so must be a judgment
on this city.

18:11.611 --> 18:13.446
A judgment on the Medicis.

18:13.513 --> 18:15.348
We rise and fall
on the people's will.

18:15.415 --> 18:18.150
Until we can assess the cause,
demonic or otherwise,

18:18.218 --> 18:20.285
we'd best seal off the Convent.

18:20.353 --> 18:22.287
Yes, agreed.

18:22.355 --> 18:26.258
Given our trouble with Rome, we don't want
our own people questioning our piety.

18:26.325 --> 18:28.393
Let me handle it.

18:28.461 --> 18:31.763
The people beheld this woman
kill herself at the sight of me.

18:31.831 --> 18:34.333
If I resolve this,
I end the gossips as well.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.035
I'll take Dragonetti
and a couple of his officers.

18:37.103 --> 18:40.272
I'll get to the bottom
of this. I promise you.

18:44.344 --> 18:45.611
Oh, go on, then.

18:47.748 --> 18:49.015
Go!

18:53.287 --> 18:56.890
Out with it. You've the look of
having eaten something distasteful.

19:02.830 --> 19:07.935
If we can speak anywhere freely,
it's here, in our family chapel.

19:08.003 --> 19:12.506
The Vatican often appears to know our
strategies just as we employ them.

19:12.574 --> 19:15.243
They murder Sforza
to end our alliance with Milan.

19:15.310 --> 19:17.912
They ask to meet Da Vinci,
just as we hire him.

19:17.979 --> 19:21.482
Understandably, you've suggested
we have a spy within our court.

19:21.550 --> 19:24.251
But before we take more
aggressive steps

19:24.319 --> 19:26.287
towards rooting out
Rome's agent,

19:26.354 --> 19:29.123
I believe there's something
else we should consider.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.496
You married Clarice
to build ties with Rome.

19:34.563 --> 19:36.130
She still
has family there.

19:36.198 --> 19:39.067
Are you're suggesting that
my wife is trying to destroy us?

19:39.135 --> 19:40.736
Not trying, no.

19:40.803 --> 19:43.806
But she may be guilelessly
expressing things in her letters.

19:43.874 --> 19:47.877
- She may be unaware...
- Clarice is exceptional and she is loyal.

19:50.447 --> 19:53.816
"When life's path is steep,
keep your mind even."

19:53.883 --> 19:58.119
You taught me that
when I was a boy.

19:58.186 --> 20:00.321
Keep your mind even.

20:05.094 --> 20:06.694
First this crisis
at the Convent,

20:06.762 --> 20:08.630
and now a traitor
in our midst.

20:09.865 --> 20:13.101
Take whatever steps
you must to find our spy.

20:13.169 --> 20:14.569
Do it quickly.

20:26.816 --> 20:27.816
There's someone ahead.

20:31.654 --> 20:33.688
- I'll handle this.
- Signor, I must insist.

20:33.756 --> 20:35.523
It's just a girl,
Captain.

20:44.033 --> 20:46.534
Steel yourself,
Bertino.

20:46.602 --> 20:49.971
Sister, can you hear me?

20:50.039 --> 20:51.706
We're here to help you.

20:51.774 --> 20:53.508
I am Giuliano de Medici...

21:03.385 --> 21:04.785
Stay with the horses.

21:14.496 --> 21:17.398
Sling her onto my horse,
tie her down.

21:17.466 --> 21:18.633
We'll take her
to the Convent.

21:18.701 --> 21:22.804
Look out!

21:28.510 --> 21:29.944
How many deaths
of the faithful

21:30.012 --> 21:31.846
will be laid at the feet
of the Medicis?

22:10.321 --> 22:11.821
Bertino!

22:34.580 --> 22:36.181
Dragonetti.

23:06.544 --> 23:10.413
Abyssus abyssum invocat.
Sed libera nos a Malo.

23:10.481 --> 23:12.716
Abyssus abyssum invocat.

23:12.784 --> 23:14.451
"Hell calls hell".

23:14.518 --> 23:16.987
One misstep leads to another.

23:17.055 --> 23:18.935
That's what's brought
the Devil to our doorstep.

23:20.124 --> 23:22.426
You and your brother
have denied God's will.

23:22.493 --> 23:24.161
Did you think
there wouldn't be a cost?

23:24.229 --> 23:28.131
Well, the cost is dear,
to be sure.

23:30.001 --> 23:33.637
But I'm not yet convinced it
was the Lord who levied it.

23:33.704 --> 23:34.972
What are you doing here?

23:35.040 --> 23:36.373
I've come looking
for a friend.

23:45.017 --> 23:46.651
Vanessa! Ssh!

23:46.718 --> 23:50.521
Ssh! Ssh!

23:55.261 --> 23:57.763
I know this woman.

23:57.830 --> 24:01.834
She was one of us,
a fellow Sister,

24:01.902 --> 24:05.304
then this lecher sold her promises of
a more colorful life.

24:07.007 --> 24:11.844
Burning, burning,
there's a fire inside me.

24:11.911 --> 24:13.111
The poor girl
came to aid us

24:13.179 --> 24:14.946
but was struck down
like the others.

24:15.014 --> 24:18.316
Well, how long have these...
possessions been going on?

24:18.384 --> 24:20.452
What business
is it of yours?

24:20.520 --> 24:22.821
Are you for God?

24:22.889 --> 24:25.390
I know what goes on
in your workshop.

24:25.458 --> 24:28.427
The nude modeling,
the carnal relations,

24:28.495 --> 24:31.831
the cadavers you debase
in the name of science.

24:31.898 --> 24:34.767
Your endeavors
condemn all they touch.

24:34.834 --> 24:37.369
We want none of
your assistance.

24:37.437 --> 24:39.772
Nor yours,
Signor Medici.

24:39.839 --> 24:43.609
Only fervid prayer
and penitence will stop this.

24:43.677 --> 24:46.345
Artista.
A word with you.

24:54.688 --> 24:58.691
Others are paid to do that, no?

25:00.727 --> 25:03.329
My father taught me no matter
the business surrounding you,

25:03.397 --> 25:04.897
never lose the count.

25:06.066 --> 25:09.336
For the Medicis are bankers
before all else.

25:09.403 --> 25:12.939
A wise man.
Taken before his time.

25:13.007 --> 25:14.641
"Piero the Gouty".

25:14.708 --> 25:17.677
For everything he was, he's
remembered most for his sickness.

25:17.745 --> 25:19.045
He is honored as a father.

25:19.113 --> 25:21.949
- To "Lorenzo the Magnificent".
- For now.

25:22.017 --> 25:24.986
Soon they may call me
by other names.

25:25.053 --> 25:28.489
Perhaps I'll be the banker who lost
the Papal accounts to the Pazzis.

25:28.557 --> 25:32.627
or the heretic who incurs the wrath
of Satan on Florence's innocents.

25:32.694 --> 25:34.928
My beloved,
you must get some rest.

25:38.232 --> 25:41.668
Today I thought of
sending Becchi away.

25:41.736 --> 25:45.972
- What? Why?
- I love him.

25:46.039 --> 25:48.007
He's been a second
father to me.

25:48.075 --> 25:52.411
But, but he questioned you.

25:52.479 --> 25:54.647
He thought that
you could be

25:54.715 --> 25:58.251
mistakenly sharing information
with your family.

25:58.318 --> 25:59.452
With Rome.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.387
Do you think asking
would offend me?

26:01.455 --> 26:04.023
- It offends me.
- It shouldn't.

26:04.091 --> 26:07.059
We live in craven times.

26:07.127 --> 26:10.463
A man would have a city in flames
to make his life more comfortable.

26:12.166 --> 26:16.369
You don't come at a snake from
the front, Lorenzo.

26:16.437 --> 26:20.774
If I were one, bringing this up
would be pointless.

26:20.842 --> 26:23.743
It would make you
vulnerable.

26:23.811 --> 26:27.013
You simply should have had my
letters read without my knowledge.

26:27.081 --> 26:31.084
In my last letter to my family,
I told them this:

26:31.151 --> 26:37.456
"There are none more loyal
to Lorenzo than I."

26:37.524 --> 26:44.997
"There are others who, if
Lorenzo fell, would move on.

26:45.065 --> 26:47.633
I could never "move on."

26:47.700 --> 26:50.469
I understand your need
for escape, Lorenzo.

26:50.537 --> 26:53.572
To feel apart
from your responsibility.

26:53.640 --> 26:57.243
You can have that escape.
But you do have to come back.

27:07.921 --> 27:12.492
You must always come back.

27:15.829 --> 27:17.831
Attend to your guns,
Da Vinci.

27:17.898 --> 27:20.233
I've been tasked
to handle this matter.

27:20.301 --> 27:21.935
And you're doing
an admirable job.

27:22.002 --> 27:25.138
I hear you slaughtered one of
the poor Sisters on the way in.

27:25.206 --> 27:28.274
- It was an accident.
- Incompetence often is.

27:28.342 --> 27:29.876
How dare you!

27:36.183 --> 27:37.951
Stay put.

27:42.756 --> 27:45.324
This is how you prove
your worth to Lorenzo?

27:45.392 --> 27:47.627
By killing his war engineer?

27:52.366 --> 27:56.803
Tell me something, Giuliano.
What is your plan?

27:56.871 --> 27:59.806
To seal off this place until
the evil spirits retreat.

27:59.874 --> 28:02.409
You won't inquire into
anything other than possession?

28:02.477 --> 28:03.945
Of course I will.

28:03.970 --> 28:06.047
Well, grace us with your
alternate theories then.

28:07.082 --> 28:10.017
- Please.
- Disease. Perhaps.

28:10.085 --> 28:12.386
- Right.
- Scrofula, plague.

28:12.454 --> 28:15.323
I know of no disease
that can ravage its host this quickly.

28:15.391 --> 28:17.091
Well, what, then?

28:17.159 --> 28:19.760
Before we accept
the Devil's work,

28:19.828 --> 28:22.797
shouldn't we first eliminate
the more profane causes?

28:22.865 --> 28:24.966
Consider panther cap
mushrooms.

28:25.033 --> 28:27.735
They're known to cause
hallucinations, even death.

28:27.803 --> 28:29.737
Right, let's see
what we've found.

28:34.309 --> 28:36.210
No, no, no,

28:37.379 --> 28:39.647
no, no, no.

28:42.217 --> 28:43.618
None of these
are the culprit.

28:43.685 --> 28:46.988
Right, next on our list,
wolf spiders.

28:47.055 --> 28:48.856
<i>The poisonous bite</i>
<i>of the Lycosidae.</i>

28:48.924 --> 28:52.059
<i>That can cause a hysterical</i>
<i>state of movement called Tarantism.</i>

28:52.127 --> 28:53.795
Wait!

28:53.862 --> 28:57.165
<i>Alas, that's not</i>
<i>the villain we seek.</i>

28:57.232 --> 29:00.001
Then what now, scribbler?

29:00.069 --> 29:02.203
Some art appreciation,
I think.

29:05.207 --> 29:07.775
What possible contaminant
can be found in here?

29:07.843 --> 29:10.378
Considering the florid images
the Sisters live amidst,

29:10.446 --> 29:13.815
not to mention the amateurish
technique on display here,

29:13.883 --> 29:15.250
is it any wonder

29:15.317 --> 29:18.853
the afflicted believe
themselves possessed?

29:18.921 --> 29:20.522
Have you gone mad too?

29:20.590 --> 29:23.525
I thought the pigments might
contain too much mercury.

29:23.592 --> 29:24.959
- But no.
- Enough, Da Vinci.

29:25.027 --> 29:26.695
When you start
licking paintings

29:26.762 --> 29:28.930
I think it's time to accept
that the Devil is here.

29:28.998 --> 29:30.732
Riders from Rome!

29:32.935 --> 29:37.072
For once, Giuliano,
you may be correct.

29:41.477 --> 29:43.245
Captain Grunwald.

29:43.312 --> 29:45.748
Giuliano de Medici.

29:45.815 --> 29:47.849
Pretty as always.

29:47.917 --> 29:49.618
I'd have thought
you loath to return,

29:49.685 --> 29:52.387
after your last mission
to Florence.

29:54.858 --> 29:57.126
We bring help
to the dear Sisters,

29:57.193 --> 29:59.261
in the person
of Prefect Mercuri.

29:59.329 --> 30:01.130
Lupo Mercuri?

30:01.197 --> 30:03.232
Curator of the
Vatican's Secret Archives?

30:03.299 --> 30:07.436
Today, I come as Prefect
for the Sacred Congregation of Rites.

30:07.503 --> 30:10.038
Your offer of assistance
is gracious, Prefect,

30:10.106 --> 30:14.576
but the Abbess is quite able
to lead the prayers for her flock.

30:14.644 --> 30:19.514
My orders are to execute
the holy rites for demonic exorcism.

30:19.582 --> 30:23.585
I have no plans to leave the good
sisters at the mercy of the Deceiver.

30:23.653 --> 30:25.487
And are you so attuned
to the infernal,

30:25.554 --> 30:28.056
you could sense their problems
all the way from Rome?

30:28.123 --> 30:30.291
We sent for aid days ago,
painter.

30:30.359 --> 30:33.728
We dare not reject Christ's
warriors in our hour of need.

30:43.006 --> 30:45.475
- Nephew.
- Your Grace.

30:45.543 --> 30:47.410
How goes the business
at the Convent?

30:47.478 --> 30:49.746
I fear the casualties mount.

30:49.813 --> 30:52.482
The Lord often requires
sacrifice.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.784
The Medicis crossed the Lord,

30:54.852 --> 30:57.453
refusing to appoint
our Archbishop in Pisa,

30:57.521 --> 31:00.255
employing a war engineer.

31:00.323 --> 31:03.092
It is God's will
to break Lorenzo

31:03.160 --> 31:04.793
and all who support him.

31:04.861 --> 31:08.931
With the possible exception
of Da Vinci, I agree with you.

31:08.999 --> 31:12.368
Lucrezia Donati has him
tied up between her thighs,

31:12.436 --> 31:15.938
his alliance with the
Medicis is a fragile one.

31:16.006 --> 31:20.643
Those weapons he makes,
they could all be ours.

31:22.279 --> 31:24.714
And what of Da Vinci's
other alliances?

31:24.782 --> 31:26.849
Has he not sided with
the Sons of Mithras?

31:26.917 --> 31:29.319
Da Vinci can deliver us
The Book of Leaves.

31:29.386 --> 31:32.655
All signs point to it
being in Florence,

31:32.723 --> 31:36.392
and then he can aid in unlocking
its unparalleled knowledge.

31:37.728 --> 31:42.664
Surely, the Lord wills
that we embrace him.

31:42.732 --> 31:45.233
Do you tell me
what the Lord wills?

31:46.703 --> 31:48.203
Of course not, Father.

31:48.271 --> 31:49.838
Holy Father.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.917
Find a way, then.

32:03.985 --> 32:07.721
Make this Da Vinci ours,
if it amuses you.

32:09.958 --> 32:12.726
Oh, Riario, your slave girl.

32:12.794 --> 32:14.428
The Abyssinian.

32:14.496 --> 32:16.130
I want her for tonight.

32:19.301 --> 32:22.336
Don't fret. You'll have
her back in the morning.

32:32.314 --> 32:33.581
Whoa!

32:39.488 --> 32:40.989
Thank you, Gualberto.

32:46.429 --> 32:48.430
Lorenzo?

32:48.498 --> 32:52.434
No.
I know how he summons you.

32:52.501 --> 32:57.272
Gualberto, the carriage,
the rose.

32:58.374 --> 33:00.275
They're all up there.

33:00.343 --> 33:01.944
Lorenzo, his father.

33:02.012 --> 33:03.579
His grandfather, Cosimo.

33:03.647 --> 33:05.414
Giuliano, his lynx.

33:05.482 --> 33:11.220
His sisters, me, Becchi.

33:11.288 --> 33:14.924
Even that pig Duke Sforza.

33:14.992 --> 33:17.861
Because he was important
to Florence.

33:20.664 --> 33:24.500
Lorenzo
doesn't summon me.

33:24.568 --> 33:27.003
Oh, but he does.

33:27.070 --> 33:30.206
It hasn't always been you.
Lorenzo's had other diversions.

33:30.274 --> 33:33.810
Well, what do you want?
For me to stay away from him?

33:33.878 --> 33:36.447
I love him.
And I love this city.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.252
Perhaps
because he is this city.

33:41.319 --> 33:43.053
You see, we have to prevail.

33:43.121 --> 33:45.523
And do you think me
an impediment to that end?

33:45.590 --> 33:47.992
You cannot be as brazen
with your affections.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.294
Not in public.

33:51.497 --> 33:55.032
There is a conspirator
in our court.

33:55.100 --> 33:58.202
As we speak, Lorenzo continues
to eliminate suspects

33:58.270 --> 34:00.638
and draws the noose tighter.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.907
They will find the traitor
and execute him.

34:02.974 --> 34:06.744
But until then, any vulnerability against
Lorenzo could be exploited.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.246
You could be used as
leverage against him.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.751
You are a distraction.
That's your function.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.353
I will tolerate that.

34:15.420 --> 34:19.091
But I will not tolerate you
becoming a vulnerability.

34:21.828 --> 34:25.231
Wait five minutes
after I leave.

34:26.232 --> 34:32.504
Clarice,
I know you love him.

34:32.572 --> 34:35.473
How can you even
stand to look at me?

34:35.541 --> 34:38.242
Because I know you will
never be up on that wall.

34:43.281 --> 34:45.616
Ah, Signora.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.583
Might I have a word
before you depart?

34:47.652 --> 34:50.688
Are you and your husband
at home tomorrow?

34:50.755 --> 34:53.889
It's vital I question you
about any recent travels.

34:53.958 --> 34:56.293
- Our travels?
- Forgive my indelicacy,

34:56.360 --> 35:00.698
but Lorenzo requests I track the
comings and goings of everyone

35:00.766 --> 35:02.868
with access to the palace.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.737
Given these vexing times,
we can't make exceptions.

35:05.805 --> 35:06.981
Absolutely.

35:07.006 --> 35:09.168
Niccolo and I will assist
you in any way that we can.

35:09.208 --> 35:12.510
Excellent.
Tomorrow noon then?

35:12.578 --> 35:15.580
Yes. Good day,
Gentile.

35:26.992 --> 35:31.429
Gualberto, you shall
retrieve me again this evening.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.865
Lorenzo requires
my presence.

35:44.845 --> 35:47.380
I cast you out,
infernal adversary!

35:47.447 --> 35:49.349
Begone from
our Sister Oriana,

35:49.416 --> 35:51.384
from all made
in the image of God

35:51.452 --> 35:54.021
and redeemed by the precious
blood of the divine Lamb.

35:54.089 --> 35:56.390
The most high God
commands you!

35:56.458 --> 35:58.826
- Man of Rome.
- The Most High God commands you.

35:58.894 --> 36:01.529
- I know why you came.
- Eternal Word of God made flesh.

36:01.597 --> 36:02.677
I know what you crave.

36:02.702 --> 36:05.434
The sacred mystery of
the cross commands you.

36:05.534 --> 36:09.070
- I know what you crave.
- The exalted Virgin Mary commands you.

36:09.138 --> 36:11.539
All you think about
is fucking.

36:11.607 --> 36:14.742
I adjure you by the living God,
by the true God,

36:14.810 --> 36:18.513
cease your deception
of this woman!

36:18.581 --> 36:20.749
Begone!

36:20.816 --> 36:22.584
- Begone!
- Prefect Mercuri!

36:22.651 --> 36:24.118
Silence!

36:27.289 --> 36:33.695
I command you, begone!

36:33.763 --> 36:36.131
The moments before she died,

36:36.198 --> 36:39.234
I saw the light of God
in her eyes.

36:39.302 --> 36:41.369
She is saved.

36:43.006 --> 36:47.142
Tell me something, Prefect.
In all your time doing this,

36:47.210 --> 36:50.212
have you ever met a demon that
you couldn't expel?

36:50.280 --> 36:52.614
No.

36:52.682 --> 36:54.482
"Ex umbra in solem".

36:54.550 --> 36:56.418
"From Shadow into the Light".

36:56.486 --> 37:00.454
Epigram of
the Secret Archives.

37:05.393 --> 37:08.828
Where am I? What am I doing?

37:08.896 --> 37:10.763
You're at the Convent.

37:10.831 --> 37:13.633
You're at the Convent.
Sshh. Sshh.

37:13.700 --> 37:16.602
- But I left it for you.
- You returned.

37:16.670 --> 37:21.975
You came back to
aid your friends.

37:22.043 --> 37:25.245
You lied, Leonardo.

37:25.313 --> 37:29.849
You promised me wonders.

37:29.917 --> 37:34.988
You said we'd fly.
You said we'd burn like the sun,

37:35.055 --> 37:39.025
but there's no sun
in your world.

37:39.093 --> 37:43.663
There's only coldness
and shadows.

37:43.730 --> 37:46.598
Ssh. Ssh. Calm yourself.

37:46.666 --> 37:48.900
You've taken ill.

37:48.968 --> 37:52.137
You're so smart,

37:52.205 --> 37:54.473
you're so beautiful,

37:54.541 --> 38:04.216
but we're just toys
to you, aren't we?

38:04.284 --> 38:07.620
I think it is time to cleanse
this dear soul as well.

38:07.687 --> 38:10.956
Don't touch her.
Don't you...

38:11.024 --> 38:15.060
Surely she deserves a chance to
fight this herself.

38:15.128 --> 38:19.497
Just one more day.

38:19.565 --> 38:21.900
In God's name.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.436
Till dawn, then.

38:24.504 --> 38:26.472
If you cannot
solve this by morning,

38:26.540 --> 38:29.241
we must burn
this evil out of them.

38:43.358 --> 38:45.425
Foolish fire.

38:52.834 --> 38:55.803
No!

39:01.309 --> 39:04.778
I'm going to fly for you,
Leo, fly to the sun.

39:32.773 --> 39:38.278
You're on Florentine soil, you
sheep-biting scut and I want you out. Now.

39:38.345 --> 39:40.981
Tough talk from the golden boy...

39:41.048 --> 39:43.049
..without your brother
to back it up.

39:45.019 --> 39:48.255
No matter. It won't be long till the
both of you are run out of town.

39:48.322 --> 39:50.356
- How do you figure that?
- Simple.

39:50.424 --> 39:54.160
Rome has more men.
And the Lord on its side.

39:54.228 --> 39:56.529
Well, we've got ten
pipe organ muskets

39:56.597 --> 40:01.567
capable of firing
33 rounds a minute on ours.

40:01.635 --> 40:04.170
Ten guns?

40:04.238 --> 40:06.907
Good to know,
thank you for that.

40:23.191 --> 40:25.058
I'll be fine on my own.

40:25.126 --> 40:27.727
As you wish,
Signora.

40:27.795 --> 40:29.930
We're starting
to eliminate suspects.

40:29.998 --> 40:32.632
<i>Some of the counters,</i>
<i>the cooks.</i>

40:32.700 --> 40:34.768
<i>The circle of suspicion</i>
<i>grows smaller.</i>

40:34.835 --> 40:37.104
Most will prove loyal.

40:37.171 --> 40:38.872
<i>One will slip.</i>

40:38.940 --> 40:40.974
And then we'll have him.

41:09.038 --> 41:10.438
I didn't send for you.

41:10.506 --> 41:14.342
I think you did.
I felt it.

41:15.611 --> 41:18.713
Matters of state obsess me.

41:18.781 --> 41:19.981
Please go.

41:20.049 --> 41:22.684
There are those who
saw me arrive -

41:22.752 --> 41:26.721
Gualberto...
Officers of the Night.

41:28.057 --> 41:31.126
And they know I only
come here for you.

41:31.194 --> 41:34.629
They may think that
you finished with me...

41:34.697 --> 41:36.097
prematurely.

41:36.165 --> 41:39.034
They'll think what
I'll have them think.

41:39.102 --> 41:40.469
I don't want you here.

41:40.537 --> 41:43.039
No.

41:43.106 --> 41:44.474
Of course you don't.

42:38.195 --> 42:39.762
You're troubled.

42:39.830 --> 42:43.132
Tell me what it is.

42:43.200 --> 42:47.036
Is it the spy?

42:47.104 --> 42:49.639
Your wife.

42:49.706 --> 42:53.576
She summoned me
this morning.

42:53.644 --> 42:55.745
- I'll have words with her.
- No, please don't.

42:55.812 --> 42:59.481
Her actions were only out
of concern for your safety.

43:01.518 --> 43:05.120
My love, this traitor
could be anyone,

43:05.188 --> 43:07.323
no matter how close
they are to you.

43:07.391 --> 43:09.224
Clarice's suspicions
are justified.

43:09.292 --> 43:12.061
You can't let your investigation
overlook anyone.

43:12.128 --> 43:14.430
Search even those
you suspect the least,

43:14.498 --> 43:17.099
for the threat may
reside anywhere -

43:17.167 --> 43:19.768
even in your own home.

43:37.654 --> 43:39.555
Maestro, that's 20.
Can I stop now?

43:39.622 --> 43:42.458
- Wash it all down.
- Why are you making me do this?

43:42.525 --> 43:45.828
We've eliminated
accidental causes.

43:45.895 --> 43:50.099
That leaves only
intentional contamination.

43:50.166 --> 43:53.769
- The wine and wafers are poisoned?
- Apparently not.

43:53.837 --> 43:57.039
It was a thought.

43:57.107 --> 43:59.208
Is it not possible
demons are the cause?

43:59.275 --> 44:00.909
It goes against logic.

44:00.977 --> 44:05.614
God punishes his admirers, and leaves
heathens like us unscathed?

44:05.682 --> 44:07.382
This has
the makings of a plot.

44:07.450 --> 44:09.718
Invoke the Devil,
make people afraid,

44:09.786 --> 44:14.122
and when they're afraid,
they stop asking questions.

44:14.190 --> 44:15.824
No, this isn't the work
of the Deceiver,

44:15.892 --> 44:18.726
this is a counter-attack.

44:18.794 --> 44:20.762
Rome is inducing
this possession.

44:20.829 --> 44:22.897
I know it.

44:22.965 --> 44:26.168
I just... I don't know how.

44:29.138 --> 44:32.474
Aargh!

44:32.542 --> 44:33.642
Bertino!

44:33.710 --> 44:37.179
I - N - R - I.

44:37.246 --> 44:40.415
I carved the letters from our
Savior's cross into his neck,

44:40.483 --> 44:43.285
driving out the demons.

44:43.352 --> 44:48.590
Which of you
will I save next?

44:48.658 --> 44:50.292
- Devil!
- No devil.

44:50.359 --> 44:52.394
- Just a Medici.
- Bind him securely!

44:57.166 --> 44:59.967
For this curse to pass
from the nuns

45:00.035 --> 45:02.770
to one of the Officers
of the Night,

45:02.837 --> 45:05.772
the answer has to be
right before us.

45:05.840 --> 45:07.941
- What has your man eaten today?
- Nothing.

45:08.009 --> 45:11.644
He offered up a fast to
Our Lord to help the afflicted nuns.

45:11.712 --> 45:14.247
- A pious man.
- The most pious of us all.

45:14.315 --> 45:19.453
Every moment, he would pray to Saint
Anthony to end the women's agony.

45:21.256 --> 45:24.024
- How did he pray?
- Kissing the feet of the statue.

45:24.092 --> 45:26.560
It's been a custom
for centuries.

45:26.628 --> 45:28.996
Vanessa, the others -
did they practice the same custom?

45:29.064 --> 45:32.199
Many of the Sisters here do.

45:32.267 --> 45:36.737
It may be time for your patron to
shed some light on our problem.

45:36.804 --> 45:38.405
I need fireflies.

45:56.157 --> 45:58.491
A capture.

45:58.559 --> 46:00.126
You've taught me well.

46:00.194 --> 46:04.264
My first victory
is close at hand.

46:04.332 --> 46:09.903
You should be careful not
to press a desperate foe too hard.

46:09.971 --> 46:16.210
Or you may find yourself at
the mercy of a divine move.

46:16.278 --> 46:23.885
'The inspired play turns
a losing game into victory.'

46:23.953 --> 46:27.222
Have your men
douse their lanterns.

46:27.289 --> 46:28.923
What are the fools up to now?

46:28.991 --> 46:31.359
It matters not,
this ends now.

46:31.426 --> 46:33.928
The distinct properties
of different lights

46:33.995 --> 46:37.965
enable us to see clearly what may
previously have been hidden.

46:38.033 --> 46:41.535
'The glow of the firefly,
for instance, intensifies anything red.'

46:41.603 --> 46:43.737
I've used it in the past
to calibrate crimson

46:43.805 --> 46:45.739
in my paints to
the most specific degree.

46:45.807 --> 46:47.841
But what does this
have to do with the demons?

46:50.011 --> 46:53.781
Everything, as it turns out.

46:53.848 --> 46:57.118
Some fungi, for instance,

46:57.186 --> 47:00.488
appear bright red
in certain lights.

47:05.527 --> 47:07.762
Burning! Make it stop!

47:07.829 --> 47:09.464
I will, my child.

47:09.532 --> 47:13.101
Prepare them with oil.
Time to burn the devil out!

47:24.447 --> 47:25.881
Brand her.

47:25.949 --> 47:28.851
Red ergot fungus!

47:28.919 --> 47:30.453
It normally grows on rye.

47:30.521 --> 47:34.257
The effects are dire: spasms,
vomiting, dropsy, gangrene,

47:34.325 --> 47:36.259
and, according to survivors,

47:36.327 --> 47:40.796
a distinct sensation of being
burned, as if by hellfire.

47:40.864 --> 47:42.364
It scrambles the mind,
you see.

47:42.432 --> 47:44.533
It causes hallucinations
and mania.

47:44.601 --> 47:48.004
Your mind is as scrambled as theirs, Da Vinci.
Now move aside or burn.

47:48.071 --> 47:51.473
We must cleanse this convent,
cauterize the infection.

47:51.541 --> 47:53.442
The nuns are beyond help,

47:53.510 --> 47:55.577
victims
of a spiritual assault.

47:55.645 --> 47:57.679
On that account,
I agree with you.

47:57.747 --> 48:02.717
An assault perpetrated by agents who
would seek to weaponize the Holy Spirit.

48:05.454 --> 48:09.456
The feet of the statue outside
are dusted with ergot.

48:09.524 --> 48:13.627
All of the victims kissed the feet of
Saint Anthony before falling sick.

48:13.695 --> 48:18.265
All of the stricken Sisters, Vanessa
- even your pious Officer, Bertino.

48:18.333 --> 48:20.068
To a person.

48:20.135 --> 48:22.403
- What you're suggesting is absurd!
- Is it?

48:22.471 --> 48:25.206
Then why have neither you nor
Captain Grunwald's men fallen sick?

48:25.273 --> 48:27.275
Hmm?

48:27.342 --> 48:29.511
Why aren't heretics
like Signor Medici,

48:29.578 --> 48:32.347
or young Nico,
or myself fallen sick?

48:32.414 --> 48:34.983
It's because we made no
obeisance to the statue.

48:35.051 --> 48:36.618
Nor did you or your men.

48:36.686 --> 48:39.387
I won't stand for this fatuous
slander another moment.

48:39.455 --> 48:43.090
Well, all you need to do is kiss the
feet of Saint Anthony to prove me wrong.

48:47.963 --> 48:50.931
"Red ergot"?

48:50.999 --> 48:53.167
Who ever heard
of such a thing?

48:53.235 --> 48:56.171
Stop! I will tell you.

48:56.239 --> 48:59.574
A historian by the name
of Geoffroy du Breuil

48:59.642 --> 49:02.611
recorded one such outbreak
in the 12th century.

49:02.679 --> 49:07.850
Perhaps you have a copy of it,
hidden amongst your Secret Archives?

49:11.255 --> 49:13.689
A treatment for
this affliction exists.

49:13.757 --> 49:16.993
It's a green ointment of these
herbs and vinegar,

49:17.060 --> 49:19.428
and a vigorous regime
of leeching.

49:22.565 --> 49:27.035
If we use this, we may still be able
to save those who've fallen sick.

49:27.102 --> 49:29.237
Well done, Da Vinci.

49:31.774 --> 49:33.141
Thank you Maestro.

50:25.830 --> 50:27.363
You know why you
brought us here.

50:28.666 --> 50:31.201
We died to prove your genius.

50:45.752 --> 50:48.453
Riario!

51:09.375 --> 51:12.311
Tell me what to say
to win the other key.

51:12.378 --> 51:15.814
Tell me what to say
to win the key!

51:15.882 --> 51:17.182
Tell me!

51:20.320 --> 51:24.523
I am a son of Earth
and starry Heaven.

51:25.825 --> 51:30.728
I am a son of Earth
and starry...

51:36.870 --> 51:38.370
Mother?

51:46.847 --> 51:48.247
Mother?

51:48.315 --> 51:51.584
Da Vinci...
can you hear me?

51:51.652 --> 51:53.620
I think he's starting
to respond.

52:01.596 --> 52:04.999
Maestro...are you alright?

52:05.067 --> 52:08.469
You kept stirring
and crying out.

52:08.537 --> 52:11.306
Vanessa's lips.

52:11.374 --> 52:14.976
Vanessa's lips...
they bore the poison.

52:18.347 --> 52:20.748
- I was in a deep vision.
- Yes, we know.

52:20.816 --> 52:24.252
The Sisters have been
treating you all day long.

52:24.320 --> 52:27.622
- Vanessa? Is she -
- Perfectly fine.

52:32.228 --> 52:35.764
You've kept Rome from claiming
a beautiful victim.

52:35.832 --> 52:37.900
It's all over now.

52:37.967 --> 52:40.502
For me,
I fear it's just begun.

52:44.841 --> 52:46.575
"Satan,

52:46.643 --> 52:48.244
for it is written,

52:48.312 --> 52:52.849
you shall worship the Lord your
God, and Him only shall you serve."

52:52.916 --> 52:54.684
You know your scripture.

52:54.752 --> 52:58.722
I now know a great many things,
Cardinal.

53:01.726 --> 53:05.095
That's a message worth
delivering to Riario.

53:05.163 --> 53:10.601
Believe me, Count Riario
and I have much to discuss.

53:17.141 --> 53:20.110
How did they do it,
Maestro?

53:20.178 --> 53:22.245
It wouldn't have been hard.

53:22.313 --> 53:27.117
The Convent's open to all
worshipers, as the Prioress said.

53:27.185 --> 53:30.487
Just one single, sympathetic
agent could have strolled in,

53:30.555 --> 53:34.725
contaminated
the toes of Saint Anthony...

53:34.793 --> 53:38.862
..and waited.

53:38.930 --> 53:43.633
And then -
Abyssus abyssum invocat -

53:43.701 --> 53:45.735
'One misstep
leads to another.'

54:09.094 --> 54:12.530
'They poisoned the pious.'

54:12.597 --> 54:15.699
Oh, God,
have mercy on the believers.

54:15.767 --> 54:18.602
- We just bought Florence more time.
- Hm.

54:24.676 --> 54:27.477
- What is it?
- A rider brought word.

54:27.545 --> 54:30.847
Your brother let slip
how many guns we have.

54:30.915 --> 54:33.149
Production continues, but...

54:33.217 --> 54:35.218
Giuliano could've hidden his
error but admitted it.

54:35.286 --> 54:37.454
For all the good that does.

54:37.522 --> 54:41.758
Rome will strike when it knows
exactly what it faces.

54:41.826 --> 54:44.027
We'll have to produce
even more guns now.

54:46.297 --> 54:49.866
Oh, yes, I ordered a full search
of the palace, no stone unturned.

54:49.933 --> 54:51.200
Have you discovered
something?

54:51.268 --> 54:53.902
Perhaps we should discuss
this in private.

54:53.970 --> 55:08.650
Show me now, Conti, or I'll think
it's you with something to hide.

55:08.718 --> 55:10.219
Where did you find this?

55:10.286 --> 55:12.488
Where?

55:12.555 --> 55:14.123
In Signor Becchi's quarters.

55:14.190 --> 55:16.091
You lie!

55:16.159 --> 55:17.860
These are not mine!

55:17.928 --> 55:20.396
It was on a shelf,
il Magnifico. I swear.

55:20.463 --> 55:22.131
Hidden amongst other books.

55:22.198 --> 55:26.536
It was you.

55:26.603 --> 55:28.270
All along,
the traitor was you.

55:28.338 --> 55:30.339
Lorenzo,
this is a mistake.

55:30.407 --> 55:32.741
Roman Scudos.

55:32.809 --> 55:34.176
Papers with the Papal Seal.

55:34.244 --> 55:38.781
A list of locations to hide them
for delivery to Rome.

55:38.848 --> 55:42.285
Found in my home!

55:42.352 --> 55:44.020
- Please, Lorenzo...
- Silence!

55:44.087 --> 55:46.255
Or I'll cut out
your tongue myself.

55:50.427 --> 55:51.627
Remove him.

55:56.500 --> 55:58.234
To the Bargello.

56:01.605 --> 56:03.473
'It would appear
you've won again.'

56:05.343 --> 56:08.344
There will be other games.

56:08.412 --> 56:11.948
It's difficult, choosing
which path to follow,

56:12.016 --> 56:17.254
trying to see a way through all
the strategies you've initiated.

56:17.321 --> 56:19.022
No.

56:19.090 --> 56:22.359
No, that's not difficult.

56:22.427 --> 56:25.662
You simply have to believe.

56:25.730 --> 56:28.699
In my experience, there's
nothing simple about belief.

56:28.766 --> 56:31.502
That's the difference
between you and me.

56:34.506 --> 56:35.773
Not the only one.

56:50.023 --> 56:52.891
I heard you.

56:52.959 --> 56:54.626
Tell Zo to dispose of these.

56:54.694 --> 56:56.361
They've served their purpose.

57:01.334 --> 57:05.470
I gather he quite prefers
it in there, no?

57:07.973 --> 57:10.542
He doesn't seem to be
interested in his freedom,

57:10.609 --> 57:13.311
maybe he likes
his pretty cage.

57:29.261 --> 57:32.563
Ignis fatuus.

57:42.341 --> 57:46.211
As one game ends,
another begins.
