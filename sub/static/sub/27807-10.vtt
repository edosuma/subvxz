WEBVTT

00:01.701 --> 00:03.269
People have searched...

00:03.304 --> 00:06.070
for decades and decades,

00:06.105 --> 00:08.039
and I don't know of anyone
that's ever actually

00:08.074 --> 00:09.674
talked to Lizzie Borden.

00:09.709 --> 00:13.145
We do hear a disembodied voice
of a woman.

00:14.580 --> 00:17.750
I felt, like, an electrical jolt
on the back of my leg.

00:17.785 --> 00:18.518
My God!

00:18.553 --> 00:19.217
It can't be.

00:19.252 --> 00:21.119
It can't be, right?
It can't be.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.089
No, that's **** up.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.857
Don't help me!

00:25.892 --> 00:28.261
We know who's in this house.

00:30.096 --> 00:33.799
When the dead are
forgotten, they become restless.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.037
- My God! You just touched me.
- What? I did not touch you.

00:36.072 --> 00:37.635
I'm Amy Bruni.

00:37.670 --> 00:40.805
A haunting encounter
redefined my life.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.276
I live with that experience
and seek answers to the unknown.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.195
It says, "I am."

00:46.230 --> 00:48.045
I'm Adam Berry.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.250
At Gettysburg, the shadows
and screams of dead soldiers

00:51.285 --> 00:53.520
turned me
into a supernatural believer.

00:53.555 --> 00:55.019
My God.

00:55.054 --> 00:58.257
Together, our investigations
bring peace to the living...

00:58.292 --> 01:00.391
You can't scare us,
you can't deter us.

01:00.392 --> 01:02.311
...by giving a voice
to the dead.

01:02.346 --> 01:04.230
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.696
What is your name?

01:05.731 --> 01:08.667
Because we believe the dead
and the living are all...

01:08.668 --> 01:10.470
Kindred spirits.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.108
So, here we are,
back in Fall River.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.743
You know, because
of Lizzie Borden,

01:16.778 --> 01:18.309
but not because
of the murders.

01:18.344 --> 01:19.979
We're not even going
to the famous axe murderer.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.212
No. No, we're not.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.847
We are going
to Maplecroft.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.818
Yeah, which is the house
that Lizzie Borden

01:25.853 --> 01:28.588
bought with her sister
directly after

01:28.623 --> 01:30.274
she was acquitted
of the murders

01:30.309 --> 01:31.890
of her father
and step-mother.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.792
The whole idea
and, like, the theory why

01:33.793 --> 01:36.012
many people think Lizzie
might have killed her father

01:36.047 --> 01:38.356
was because he was a miser,
and he had so much money

01:38.391 --> 01:40.666
and they lived in that
little house on Second Street.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.301
This is the house that may
or may not have

01:43.302 --> 01:46.021
been bought with blood money,
if you think about it.

01:46.056 --> 01:48.741
Lizzie Borden allegedly
killed her step-mother

01:48.776 --> 01:51.210
before turning the blade
on her father.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.711
She was acquitted in 1893

01:53.746 --> 01:56.949
despite widespread accusations
of murder.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.917
After the trial of the century,

01:58.952 --> 02:02.054
Lizzie inherited
her father's massive fortune,

02:02.055 --> 02:03.154
bought this house,

02:03.189 --> 02:05.341
and named it "Maplecroft."

02:05.376 --> 02:07.502
Here she lived a secluded life

02:07.537 --> 02:09.592
for the remainder of her days.

02:09.627 --> 02:13.766
Up until now, no one has
really discussed in depth --

02:13.801 --> 02:15.600
- Or investigated it, right?
- No.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.603
The doors of Maplecroft
have been shut

02:18.604 --> 02:23.109
to paranormal investigators
since her death in 1927,

02:23.144 --> 02:25.462
but that's about to change.

02:25.497 --> 02:27.745
So why us, and why now?

02:27.780 --> 02:29.315
So, the people who bought it
are the people

02:29.350 --> 02:30.916
who currently own
the other house...

02:30.951 --> 02:32.182
...the murder house.
- Right.

02:32.217 --> 02:33.918
We've worked
with the people

02:33.953 --> 02:35.838
from the Lizzie Borden house
on so many occasions.

02:35.873 --> 02:37.723
I've known them for years,
and I think that's why

02:37.758 --> 02:39.424
they're entrusting us
to do this,

02:39.459 --> 02:41.726
because everyone said
it wasn't haunted,

02:41.761 --> 02:44.329
but then they got in there,
and they started doing things

02:44.330 --> 02:45.530
and they started
moving things around

02:45.565 --> 02:47.900
and they started talking
about what happened,

02:47.935 --> 02:49.833
and activity
started happening.

02:49.868 --> 02:53.138
Employees Sue and Deb
reported being grabbed,

02:53.173 --> 02:56.408
doors slamming,
and hearing disembodied voices.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.194
They want
a definitive answer...

02:58.229 --> 02:59.911
...of who is
haunting Maplecroft...

02:59.946 --> 03:01.913
...because they've been having
a lot of activity there. - Right.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.848
They want us
to come in and gauge,

03:03.883 --> 03:05.850
like, what is the potential
here for activity.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.988
You know, once they start
having full-on tours and guests

03:09.023 --> 03:10.421
and people
investigating,

03:10.456 --> 03:11.989
like, what's gonna happen
to this house?

03:11.990 --> 03:14.693
Is it gonna go off the chain,
like the Second Street house?

03:14.728 --> 03:17.396
So, we're gonna have to push
the boundaries a little bit...

03:17.431 --> 03:19.331
...just to see what kind
of activity we can get...

03:19.366 --> 03:21.866
...to set a base level, right?
- Absolutely.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.335
Look at this place.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.002
There it is.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.403
- It is massive compared to the house
on Second Street. - Yeah.

03:26.438 --> 03:29.691
Just from the outside,
this part looks...

03:29.726 --> 03:32.945
Like, it looks compact
and contained,

03:32.980 --> 03:34.513
but I know
it extends west.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.214
- It's sprawling.
- It's huge.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.251
It's a fortress,
to keep everyone out

03:38.286 --> 03:39.819
and to keep her
inside of it.

03:39.854 --> 03:41.385
She spent 34 years here.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.720
This is the longest she lived
anywhere --

03:42.721 --> 03:44.990
longer than she lived
in that house on Second Street.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.259
I mean, I could see why
she probably just led, like,

03:47.294 --> 03:49.260
a private life here

03:49.295 --> 03:51.930
and just ran away
from everything,

03:51.931 --> 03:54.300
but at the same time,
was still very much present

03:54.335 --> 03:56.302
in Fall River,
which is crazy to me.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.503
But is she still
in there?

04:00.773 --> 04:01.640
Who are we meeting?

04:01.675 --> 04:02.473
We are gonna meet Deb.

04:02.508 --> 04:05.175
And so she has worked
with owners for a while,

04:05.210 --> 04:07.480
and I think she might be one
of the future tour guides here,

04:07.515 --> 04:09.582
but she's had
a lot of experiences here.

04:09.617 --> 04:12.983
- Okay.
- Hey, Deb.

04:13.018 --> 04:15.254
Welcome to Maplecroft.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.522
- Wow.
- My God.

04:17.523 --> 04:18.923
Holy cow.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.325
This place...

04:20.326 --> 04:21.625
My gosh.

04:21.660 --> 04:24.697
I've been, like,
wanting to get into this house

04:24.732 --> 04:26.264
for so many years.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.300
So, she moved here
after the trial, right?

04:28.335 --> 04:30.301
She did -- Her and her sister
Emma moved here.

04:30.302 --> 04:32.387
And then she lived out
her days here, right?

04:32.422 --> 04:34.473
She did.
Lizzie died in this house.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.707
She did?

04:36.742 --> 04:38.663
She was actually waked
here in the front parlor.

04:38.664 --> 04:39.944
- Really?
- Let's take a look at this.

04:39.979 --> 04:42.314
Want to take a walk in there
and see that?

04:42.349 --> 04:44.650
So this is where her casket
would have been.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.035
My God.

04:46.070 --> 04:47.136
Wait, right here?

04:48.237 --> 04:49.053
It's kind of sad.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.855
She was really lonely,
and she moved here

04:50.890 --> 04:54.460
to this house on the hill,
where she always wanted to live,

04:54.495 --> 04:57.430
but she was still ostracized
by the community.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.632
Do you know why
she would stay here?

04:59.667 --> 05:00.784
Lizzie was stubborn.

05:00.819 --> 05:01.866
I mean, clearly.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.268
I feel like
I would've left.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.870
I would've run out of town
at that point.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.971
So, now as far
as this room,

05:07.006 --> 05:09.607
have you heard of any activity
going on in here?

05:09.608 --> 05:12.144
Well, one evening,
we were just sitting over there.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.612
Sue was there,
and I was actually

05:13.647 --> 05:15.013
on that chair over there,

05:15.048 --> 05:17.399
and you heard loud,
loud footsteps.

05:17.434 --> 05:19.751
I heard that,
and I was scared.

05:19.786 --> 05:20.885
That's pretty clear.

05:20.886 --> 05:22.419
It was crazy.

05:22.454 --> 05:24.355
What activity is happening
in the house

05:24.390 --> 05:27.125
that leads you to believe
that it is Lizzie?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.826
We do hear a disembodied voice
of a woman.

05:29.861 --> 05:32.664
I was just chatting right
over there in the front foyer,

05:32.699 --> 05:34.751
and I heard a woman giggle
in the dining room.

05:34.786 --> 05:36.768
- And I heard that Lizzie had
a great giggle, so... - Wow.

05:36.803 --> 05:39.204
It happens at different times
when you least expect it.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.190
Like, we could be
just walking around

05:41.225 --> 05:43.142
and, all of a sudden,
you would hear it.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.428
I feel like...
once word gets out

05:45.463 --> 05:47.572
that people are
investigating here

05:47.607 --> 05:49.729
and once it gets
opened up in things,

05:49.764 --> 05:51.851
there's gonna be
an uptick in activity.

05:51.886 --> 05:53.183
Well, there already
has been.

05:53.218 --> 05:56.722
So I wonder if we come in
and spend three solid days here,

05:56.757 --> 05:58.924
I don't know if
we'll actually make things...

05:58.959 --> 06:01.058
...kind of really rile up here.
- Exactly.

06:01.093 --> 06:03.196
So this is, I feel like,
will be a good, like,

06:03.231 --> 06:06.732
kind of temperature
of the building...

06:06.767 --> 06:08.098
...and see what's
going on here. - Yeah.

06:08.133 --> 06:09.400
All right, well, why don't you show us
some more of the house?

06:09.435 --> 06:11.160
Want to see the second floor?

06:11.195 --> 06:12.886
- Yeah, yeah.
- Let's do it.

06:12.921 --> 06:14.639
Let's go in this direction.

06:14.674 --> 06:17.443
So, that's another thing --
they will touch you.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.410
They like
to touch people.

06:20.445 --> 06:22.947
- So, this was Lizzie's bathroom.
- Wow.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.549
- We have her tub.
- That's crazy.

06:25.584 --> 06:27.685
Isn't that amazing?

06:27.720 --> 06:30.823
And we have her sink
and her medicine cabinet.

06:30.858 --> 06:31.624
My goodness.

06:31.659 --> 06:32.390
Pretty cool.

06:32.391 --> 06:35.393
- So this has all just been here
the whole time. -

06:35.428 --> 06:37.328
Since there are some
original belongings here,

06:37.363 --> 06:39.632
has there ever been an activity
in here that you know of?

06:39.667 --> 06:41.633
Sue has a really good story
for you,

06:41.668 --> 06:43.066
so I'll let her
tell you that.

06:43.101 --> 06:45.337
Okay, so something happened
to Sue in here.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.171
This was
Lizzie's room.

06:47.172 --> 06:50.509
Pretty much the way
she would've had it.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.312
This is the room
she died in.

06:52.347 --> 06:54.045
Well, we're not
really sure.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.546
I'm gonna show you guys
the addition

06:55.547 --> 06:56.747
on the back of the house.

06:56.782 --> 06:58.783
She may have passed
in that room.

06:58.818 --> 07:02.720
She wasn't feeling well
as she got older.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.789
- It was a little more quiet back here
and peaceful. - I see.

07:05.824 --> 07:08.760
So she thought
that she would build on.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.662
- We'll spend some time in here,
for sure. - Absolutely.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.564
- It's so crazy that Lizzie went...
- Okay. Yeah.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.234
from that little house
on Second Street

07:15.269 --> 07:16.801
to this great,
big mansion.

07:16.802 --> 07:18.169
Isn't it amazing?

07:18.204 --> 07:19.703
Yeah, her and Emma
each inherited

07:19.738 --> 07:23.041
half of a small fortune,
so she was able to afford this.

07:23.076 --> 07:26.344
My God.
Thank you for showing us around.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.246
We will definitely let you
know what we find.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.198
I can't wait.

07:29.233 --> 07:30.080
I feel special.

07:30.115 --> 07:32.117
We're the first people
to do, like,

07:32.152 --> 07:34.119
a really in-depth
investigation here.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.855
Investigating Maplecroft

07:36.890 --> 07:38.455
is a big deal.

07:38.490 --> 07:39.858
And reaching out
to one of the most

07:39.893 --> 07:41.877
notorious women in history

07:41.912 --> 07:43.861
should not be taken lightly.

07:43.862 --> 07:47.199
So, we're doing something
a little out of the norm.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.536
We're calling in Chip Coffey
right off the bat.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.537
Alright,
so Chip's gonna meet us.

07:52.572 --> 07:53.504
I hope he's okay

07:53.539 --> 07:55.607
with what we're gonna
ask him to do.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.676
I know, right?
I mean, he trusts us.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.510
He does trust us.

07:59.545 --> 08:01.564
I mean, he knows
what town he's in.

08:01.599 --> 08:03.925
He doesn't know
where he's going.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.856
I think, in order
to do this right,

08:05.891 --> 08:07.753
I think we ask him
if he'll let us...

08:07.788 --> 08:09.720
...put a blindfold on him.
- Absolutely.

08:09.755 --> 08:13.159
Like, he should be blindfolded
at least for the drive

08:13.194 --> 08:14.961
and maybe the first part
of the walkthrough...

08:14.996 --> 08:16.059
Right.

08:16.094 --> 08:18.731
...because he knows
what Maplecroft is.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.141
Alright.
Thank you, Mr. Coffey.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.108
- Alright, good. You can't see?
- Nope.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.212
Alright, here we go.

08:34.746 --> 08:38.082
Outside influences
are undeniably powerful.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.417
That's why we blindfolded Chip.

08:40.452 --> 08:44.188
It also increases the intensity
of his psychic sense,

08:44.222 --> 08:46.925
allowing him to more
easily channel thoughts

08:46.960 --> 08:48.426
from beyond the grave.

08:48.427 --> 08:51.263
Okay.
You are in the house.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.798
All of a sudden,
I'm very upset.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.306
Like, agitated and upset.

09:02.707 --> 09:05.642
Like, I don't like it.

09:05.677 --> 09:09.481
There's a sense of...
frenetic...

09:09.516 --> 09:12.650
Like, out of control...

09:12.685 --> 09:16.454
I'm being hit by every single
type of emotion.

09:17.923 --> 09:19.425
It's just, I'm trying to get
a grip on my emotions,

09:19.460 --> 09:23.060
and I just can't.

09:23.061 --> 09:24.797
I hear, "Stop!"

09:30.502 --> 09:32.387
"Leave me alone."

09:32.422 --> 09:34.238
Who came up to me?

09:34.273 --> 09:35.441
There's no one right
in front of you.

09:35.476 --> 09:38.045
- There's no one right here.
- Yeah, there is.

09:43.382 --> 09:47.886
"Yeah."
"You got him blindfolded."

09:47.921 --> 09:49.954
"You think you're smart."

09:49.955 --> 09:51.890
I worry about
this can of worms...

09:51.925 --> 09:53.757
...that they're opening here.
- My God.

09:53.792 --> 09:55.461
It can't be.
It can't be.

10:03.101 --> 10:04.502
This is Maplecroft,

10:04.537 --> 10:07.539
once home to the infamous
Lizzie Borden.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.040
Chip Coffey is blindfolded

10:09.041 --> 10:11.610
and conducting a psychic reading
of the house.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.077
He doesn't know where he is,

10:13.112 --> 10:16.415
but something or someone
knows he's here.

10:16.450 --> 10:19.183
Who came up to me?

10:19.218 --> 10:20.452
There's no one right
in front of you.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.790
- There's no one right here.
- Yeah, there is.

10:28.397 --> 10:33.864
Okay.

10:33.899 --> 10:36.201
That was intense.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.469
- Come towards me.
- Okay.

10:38.504 --> 10:40.672
And then we're gonna walk
into this room here --

10:40.707 --> 10:42.174
just gonna walk
through it.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.113
Female --
"Just let me sit.

10:50.148 --> 10:52.318
Just let me sit."
That's what I hear.

10:52.353 --> 10:54.752
Female voice.
"Just let me sit."

10:54.753 --> 10:56.355
"Just let me sit.
Let me be.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.891
Leave me alone."

10:58.926 --> 11:01.393
Is there death here?

11:01.428 --> 11:03.694
Do we know of?

11:03.729 --> 11:06.214
She was actually waked here
in the front parlor.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.699
So this is where her casket
would have been.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.268
Wait, right here?

11:11.637 --> 11:14.672
'Cause I feel sick,
like I'm...

11:14.673 --> 11:16.741
I know I'm gonna die...

11:16.776 --> 11:18.810
and I don't give a damn.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.845
It's, like, let it come.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.086
"You all think
you know everything.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.855
You know nothing
about me."

11:32.827 --> 11:34.260
That way.

11:34.295 --> 11:35.659
Okay.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.329
Yeah, we can walk,
straight ground.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.830
It's level-level.

11:41.466 --> 11:43.035
It's all level.

11:45.437 --> 11:47.206
Well, here, there's stairs
right in front of you.

11:47.241 --> 11:49.441
I just want to touch
something on the side.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.293
Alright...

11:50.328 --> 11:51.110
There you go.

11:54.165 --> 11:57.081
Yeah.

11:57.116 --> 11:58.884
"Don't help me!"

12:01.420 --> 12:02.720
That's what she screams.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.323
She is screaming
"Don't help me"?

12:04.358 --> 12:07.725
"Don't help me."

12:07.760 --> 12:09.361
I'm just gonna do
a stream of consciousness

12:09.396 --> 12:10.629
of what she's saying
in my head.

12:10.664 --> 12:11.614
Can I do that?

12:11.649 --> 12:12.529
Yes, please do.

12:12.564 --> 12:16.266
"You got him blindfolded."

12:16.267 --> 12:17.870
"You think you're smart."

12:22.675 --> 12:24.575
"I don't care
what you think."

12:30.582 --> 12:32.818
I have to look right.

12:35.887 --> 12:37.856
I have to look right.

12:41.226 --> 12:42.761
I won't crack.

12:45.230 --> 12:46.966
Interesting.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.069
Can we remove
the blindfolds?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.171
Not yet.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.347
"I'm sorry."

13:06.185 --> 13:07.786
"I'm sorry."

13:11.756 --> 13:14.959
And she stepped
away from me.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.060
- Should I take it off?
- Yeah.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.462
Hand his glasses,
please.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.497
Here comes glasses.

13:25.170 --> 13:26.872
It's...crazy.

13:38.284 --> 13:42.319
It's a real, strong presence
in this house.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.321
Huge!

13:43.356 --> 13:44.287
Yeah.

13:44.322 --> 13:45.958
From the moment
we walked in here,

13:45.993 --> 13:47.424
we felt the same
exact way. - Huge.

13:47.459 --> 13:50.795
Welcome to Maplecroft.

13:56.635 --> 14:02.607
Which explains to me
something very clear now...

14:02.642 --> 14:04.108
...who it was...

14:04.143 --> 14:07.045
...that was coming at me.

14:08.464 --> 14:09.779
Or was it?

14:09.814 --> 14:11.415
That's why
you're here.

14:14.552 --> 14:17.422
Chip detected
a powerful female presence

14:17.457 --> 14:18.722
during his reading,

14:18.757 --> 14:22.043
but the entity
stopped communicating with him.

14:22.078 --> 14:25.329
Is the spirit of Lizzie Borden
here in Maplecroft?

14:25.330 --> 14:28.734
We are headed upstairs
to conduct an EVP session.

14:28.769 --> 14:29.833
Chip is joining us

14:29.868 --> 14:32.637
in case the entity
shows herself again.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.406
So, let's, um...
get our stuff together.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.442
We'll head up into
the bedroom area --

14:37.477 --> 14:38.575
- Lizzie's bedroom.
- Yes.

14:38.610 --> 14:40.811
I've got the recorder.
You've got...

14:40.846 --> 14:43.046
- SLS and trigger-object
proximity sensor... - SLS.

14:43.081 --> 14:45.015
...recorder, that.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.918
Alright.
Let's head up.

14:55.794 --> 14:58.130
So, Chip, if you get
any impressions at any point,

14:58.165 --> 15:00.299
just let us know, okay?

15:00.334 --> 15:01.316
Yes.

15:01.351 --> 15:02.298
So...

15:02.333 --> 15:05.469
whoever's here,

15:05.470 --> 15:10.842
do you know who
the spirit is here

15:10.877 --> 15:12.877
that would touch people?

15:14.179 --> 15:17.281
This place is about to be opened
up to the public,

15:17.282 --> 15:20.401
and people are going to be
in here all the time,

15:20.436 --> 15:23.521
asking you questions
you might not want to answer.

15:23.556 --> 15:24.888
Was this your safe place?

15:24.923 --> 15:27.108
Was this kind of
where you went

15:27.143 --> 15:29.294
to get away
from everything?

15:31.529 --> 15:34.499
Do you know what happened
at the Second Street house?

15:34.534 --> 15:37.169
Do you remember
your step-mother?

15:40.038 --> 15:41.373
And your father?

15:46.578 --> 15:49.848
Have you seen us
at the Second Street house?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.987
I'm gonna
listen to this.

16:03.664 --> 16:04.697
What?

16:05.964 --> 16:07.064
Has the activity changed

16:07.099 --> 16:08.733
since the first time
you went?

16:08.768 --> 16:10.333
- It is picking up, I think.
- Okay.

16:10.368 --> 16:11.335
Good to know.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.038
Who is touching people?

16:14.439 --> 16:15.441
- Did you guys hear that?
- Yeah.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.150
We're trying
to chase down

16:25.185 --> 16:26.584
the spirit of Lizzie Borden.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.553
Someone's here speaking to us.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.122
We just don't know who.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.529
"I don't -- "
Do you hear that?

16:37.564 --> 16:38.429
It said,
"I don't know."

16:38.464 --> 16:40.397
"I don't know."

17:16.434 --> 17:17.635
Nothing.

17:18.837 --> 17:22.808
Chip, any --
is there anything else?

17:22.843 --> 17:25.608
It's crazy-quiet.

17:27.612 --> 17:29.748
Someone answered
one of our questions,

17:29.783 --> 17:31.181
but only one.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.582
Communication ceased

17:32.617 --> 17:35.119
the second we brought up
the double-murder.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.787
<i> Chip's</i> work here is done,

17:36.822 --> 17:38.724
but <i> we're</i> just getting started.

17:38.759 --> 17:39.957
We're heading down the road

17:39.958 --> 17:43.362
to where the heinous axe murders
occurred in 1892.

17:43.397 --> 17:46.396
That's where Deb's co-worker,
Sue, works.

17:46.431 --> 17:50.302
We're gonna go meet Sue
at the Second Street house,

17:50.337 --> 17:51.969
which is where
the axe murders took place.

17:51.970 --> 17:54.839
Sue was our client
when we investigated

17:54.874 --> 17:56.573
the Lizzie Borden
house before.

17:56.608 --> 17:58.944
I'm glad that <i>
she</i> can help <i> us</i> now.

17:58.979 --> 18:00.277
Well, yeah.

18:00.312 --> 18:03.681
I'm interested to see what Sue's
experiences at Maplecroft,

18:03.682 --> 18:06.082
'cause she's super level-headed,
as you know. - Yeah.

18:06.117 --> 18:08.752
And so it'll be neat

18:08.787 --> 18:10.555
to hear what happened
to her there.

18:14.993 --> 18:18.428
Deb told us that you'd had
some experiences at Maplecroft.

18:18.429 --> 18:20.532
Can you tell us what happened
there, exactly?

18:20.567 --> 18:21.698
I've had a few
experiences,

18:21.699 --> 18:23.733
but I think the most
jolting one to me

18:23.768 --> 18:26.071
would have been in the bathroom
on the second floor --

18:26.106 --> 18:27.637
Lizzie's original bathroom.

18:27.672 --> 18:29.240
I was hanging the shower curtain
up there,

18:29.275 --> 18:30.809
so I was standing on the chair
in that room.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.043
I'm talking out loud
as I was doing so,

18:33.044 --> 18:34.244
and I said,
"Lizzie, I think

18:34.279 --> 18:36.148
you really would have loved
having a shower."

18:36.183 --> 18:37.948
And as I was
talking out loud,

18:37.949 --> 18:40.568
I felt, like, an electrical jolt
on the back of my leg.

18:40.603 --> 18:43.187
But you could feel, like,
fingers attached to the jolt.

18:43.222 --> 18:44.421
- Really?
- And I was like,

18:44.456 --> 18:46.358
"Okay, you are here
listening to me."

18:46.393 --> 18:47.226
Yes.

18:47.261 --> 18:48.024
Yeah.

18:48.059 --> 18:49.625
What room...

18:49.660 --> 18:51.830
is the most uncomfortable
for you?

18:54.032 --> 18:55.766
I think that
addition room.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.703
We believe Lizzie might have
passed away in that room,

18:58.738 --> 19:01.271
and I think that room.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.758
And I just get an uneasy,
like somebody's watching me.

19:03.793 --> 19:06.211
Has the activity changed
since the first time you went

19:06.246 --> 19:07.777
to the most recent time
that you went?

19:07.812 --> 19:11.348
- I think the more we go there,
it is picking up, I think. - Okay.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.018
Good to know.

19:13.053 --> 19:14.284
Yeah.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.719
Back at Maplecroft,

19:15.754 --> 19:18.590
we'll focus on the two rooms
Sue fears most.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.393
We need to know who, what,

19:20.428 --> 19:22.161
or how many entities are here.

19:25.797 --> 19:28.166
So, the important thing
about this bathroom, I think,

19:28.201 --> 19:32.904
is the fact that these
were all fixtures

19:32.939 --> 19:35.624
that Lizzie Borden
actually used.

19:35.659 --> 19:38.274
So you have to think,
Lizzie, like,

19:38.309 --> 19:41.912
actually looked in this mirror
every day. -

19:41.947 --> 19:43.898
Our friend Sue
was in here,

19:43.933 --> 19:45.959
and she was
working on...

19:45.994 --> 19:47.985
this shower curtain here.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.186
Do you remember her?

19:50.221 --> 19:52.590
She says she felt as though
she was touched in here

19:52.625 --> 19:55.427
while she was putting
the shower curtain up.

20:12.577 --> 20:13.643
I'm sorry,
what was that --

20:13.678 --> 20:15.180
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

20:20.852 --> 20:21.720
"Not me."

20:21.755 --> 20:22.588
Who is it?

20:28.159 --> 20:29.527
Listen to it.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.746
It can't be.

20:30.781 --> 20:31.965
- Can't be.
- No.

20:38.836 --> 20:41.289
Amy and I are
the first to conduct

20:41.324 --> 20:43.742
a full-fledged investigation
of Maplecroft,

20:43.777 --> 20:45.208
the home Lizzie Borden bought

20:45.243 --> 20:48.179
after inheriting
her murdered father's fortune.

20:48.214 --> 20:51.116
We're looking for Lizzie
and whoever is responsible

20:51.151 --> 20:53.252
for the physical
paranormal activity.

20:59.023 --> 20:59.890
"Not me."

20:59.891 --> 21:01.994
"That's not me."

21:06.431 --> 21:07.632
Yeah. I hear it.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.084
"That's not me."

21:09.119 --> 21:10.466
Who is it?

21:10.501 --> 21:12.770
It seems very insistent.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.005
- Like, "That's not me."
- Right.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.073
Like, so, people
are getting touched.

21:17.108 --> 21:20.711
This voice is saying
"That is not me that does that."

21:20.746 --> 21:22.380
So, who's touching people?

21:25.781 --> 21:25.781
What was that?

21:25.816 --> 21:27.518
That was down that way.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.185
- Did you guys hear that?
- Yeah.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.956
It was really loud.
It was like right here.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.123
The addition.

21:33.158 --> 21:35.825
So, it was a loud,
like...

21:35.860 --> 21:37.594
That's where
she might have died

21:37.595 --> 21:39.498
and the room
she was afraid of.

21:41.399 --> 21:45.402
So, to whoever's
house this is,

21:45.403 --> 21:47.906
thanks for letting us
be here tonight.

21:47.941 --> 21:49.405
We've come here because

21:49.440 --> 21:51.243
there's a lot of history
to this house,

21:51.278 --> 21:52.743
and the new owners

21:52.778 --> 21:56.148
are wondering
if there <i> is</i> anyone here.

21:56.183 --> 21:57.447
So, if you're
in this room,

21:57.482 --> 21:59.684
can you talk into
this little red light here?

21:59.719 --> 22:03.620
This is a recorder.
It won't hurt you.

22:03.655 --> 22:07.058
It just can hear your voice,
even if sometimes we can't.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.645
So, if you could just
get as close

22:09.680 --> 22:12.256
to this little red light
as you can

22:12.291 --> 22:14.832
and just introduce yourself,
please.

22:18.870 --> 22:22.806
People still talk
about this house,

22:22.807 --> 22:27.011
and they talk about
its former occupants.

22:27.046 --> 22:30.816
Is there anyone else here
besides you?

22:30.851 --> 22:34.586
Who else lives in this house
with you?

22:36.655 --> 22:38.990
Are you okay
with us asking you

22:39.025 --> 22:41.593
questions about the past?

22:47.298 --> 22:50.001
Alright, let's listen to this
and see if anybody's talking.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.137
It says something.

23:09.172 --> 23:10.287
Two syllables.

23:10.288 --> 23:12.357
It sounds like a name,
but I can't make it out.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.489
I know, right?

23:13.524 --> 23:15.009
But let's just keep
listening,

23:15.044 --> 23:16.495
see if there's
anything else.

23:18.696 --> 23:20.296
I hate this say it.

23:22.918 --> 23:25.436
Listen to it.
Listen to it.

23:25.471 --> 23:26.870
It can't be.

23:26.871 --> 23:28.073
It really can't be.

23:31.409 --> 23:32.376
My God!

23:32.411 --> 23:33.309
It can't be.

23:33.344 --> 23:34.212
It can't be, right?

23:34.247 --> 23:36.179
- It can't be.
- No.

23:36.214 --> 23:38.281
So, Lizzie
changed her name.

23:38.316 --> 23:40.618
She kind of was trying
to reinvent herself.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.920
That person is who we should
be talking to.

23:51.729 --> 23:55.733
Paranormal activity is
on the rise here in Maplecroft.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.519
We're reaching out
to Lizzie Borden...

23:57.554 --> 24:03.872
...in the room
where she might have died.

24:03.907 --> 24:06.411
- I hate to say it.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.880
Listen to it.
Listen to it.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.279
It can't be.

24:10.314 --> 24:11.917
It really can't be.

24:14.852 --> 24:15.719
My God!

24:15.754 --> 24:16.552
It can't be.

24:16.587 --> 24:20.857
- It can't be, right?
- With a Borden?

24:20.892 --> 24:24.126
- It **** is Lizzie Borden, isn't it?
- Yeah.

24:24.161 --> 24:25.962
You guys...

24:28.601 --> 24:30.533
That's **** up.

24:30.568 --> 24:32.269
- You know what, though?
It's okay. - Yeah.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.773
Let's keep it cool.

24:43.132 --> 24:44.716
What in the...

24:52.624 --> 24:53.758
"I am not."

24:56.928 --> 24:59.329
I mean,
do we walk in here

24:59.364 --> 25:01.032
and get the name
"Lizzie Borden"?

25:01.067 --> 25:02.265
Like, is it that easy?

25:02.300 --> 25:05.301
Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, like...

25:05.336 --> 25:07.105
Is it what we want to hear,
and it's, like,

25:07.140 --> 25:08.771
somebody saying
the name?

25:08.806 --> 25:11.742
Like...
it's so bizarre to me.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.461
It's just very strange,

25:13.496 --> 25:15.111
and then when she said...

25:15.146 --> 25:17.213
...she doesn't want
to talk about it... - Like, it's --

25:17.248 --> 25:19.784
That's what is gonna be
talked about,

25:19.819 --> 25:21.319
over and over
and over again.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.785
I've always
focused so much

25:22.820 --> 25:24.572
on what happened
during the trial.

25:24.607 --> 25:26.324
Like, I don't really
know a lot

25:26.359 --> 25:27.725
about Lizzie after that.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.427
Yeah.

25:33.130 --> 25:35.533
Last night,
we finally got some answers.

25:35.568 --> 25:36.700
It's very possible

25:36.735 --> 25:38.870
we're the first
paranormal investigators

25:38.905 --> 25:40.437
to speak with Lizzie Borden.

25:40.438 --> 25:43.441
But the house went quiet
when we brought up the past.

25:43.476 --> 25:45.543
So we're headed to the library
to learn more

25:45.578 --> 25:48.111
about Lizzie's life
after the trial.

25:48.112 --> 25:49.178
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:49.213 --> 25:49.964
Have a seat.

25:49.999 --> 25:50.680
- Thank you.
- Appreciate this.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.582
- Found some interesting
things for you. - That's great.

25:52.617 --> 25:55.053
It's Maplecroft this time,
you know?

25:55.088 --> 25:56.719
- Yes.
- Here we are.

25:56.754 --> 25:59.023
This is a whole new story,
I feel like.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.293
Isn't it kind of strange
that she's stayed...

26:01.328 --> 26:02.558
...in Fall River?
- Right.

26:02.593 --> 26:04.294
Was she constantly...

26:04.329 --> 26:06.662
bombarded with,
you know, the public?

26:06.697 --> 26:09.967
Yeah, after the trial,
she chose to remain here,

26:09.968 --> 26:11.736
even though all of her friends
abandoned her --

26:11.771 --> 26:13.135
most of them,
I should say.

26:13.170 --> 26:16.007
She walked down the street
and people would be clucking

26:16.042 --> 26:17.540
and "
that's Lizzie Borden."

26:17.575 --> 26:19.243
And some of her friends
would see her...

26:19.278 --> 26:21.311
...and make eye contact...

26:21.346 --> 26:23.045
...and then walk the other way.

26:23.080 --> 26:26.082
And here's a quote I found,
kind of revealing about that.

26:26.083 --> 26:29.320
She said, "When the truth
comes out about this murder,

26:29.355 --> 26:31.789
I want to be living
in Fall River

26:31.824 --> 26:33.289
so I can walk downtown

26:33.324 --> 26:34.924
and meet those
of my old friends

26:34.959 --> 26:37.261
who have been cutting me down
all these years."

26:37.296 --> 26:39.195
It's so bizarre.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.198
I mean, it's so crazy
because it's like,

26:41.233 --> 26:42.984
I don't think
we're gonna be able to --

26:43.019 --> 26:44.735
I don't know
if we're ever gonna know.

26:44.736 --> 26:47.070
- It's America's Jack the Ripper case.
- Yeah.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.073
And people are gonna be
talking about it forever.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.573
To tell you about the house
a little bit,

26:50.608 --> 26:53.577
Lizzie bought that house
along with her sister Emma

26:53.612 --> 26:55.478
shortly after
the acquittal.

26:55.513 --> 26:58.049
Lizzie lived in the house
for 34 years,

26:58.084 --> 26:59.950
longer than Second Street.
- Yeah.

26:59.985 --> 27:03.353
And Emma only lived in the house
for 12 years

27:03.354 --> 27:05.573
because they had kind of
a falling out.

27:05.608 --> 27:07.792
And she said,
"The reason for me leaving,

27:07.827 --> 27:10.727
I'll never discuss it."

27:10.728 --> 27:11.962
That makes you
think, too.

27:11.997 --> 27:12.497
Yeah.

27:12.997 --> 27:14.899
And she had to go
to her reverend

27:14.934 --> 27:16.632
to get advice on this,
so...

27:16.667 --> 27:19.435
It sounds like Emma was
kind of more orthodox

27:19.470 --> 27:24.108
and really just wanted to live,
like, a quiet life.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.876
She wanted to avoid
the notoriety.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.510
After her sister leaves,

27:27.545 --> 27:30.081
paint me a picture,
if you can,

27:30.116 --> 27:32.582
of Lizzie's life
at Maplecroft.

27:32.617 --> 27:36.320
I found that she
had almost a metamorphosis

27:36.355 --> 27:38.121
in 1905.

27:38.122 --> 27:41.226
She changed her name from Lizzie
to Lizbeth.

27:43.127 --> 27:44.629
That's what she said.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.035
It says something.

27:52.036 --> 27:54.137
So, Lizzie
changed her name?

27:54.172 --> 27:57.041
Yes, Lizbeth.
And that happened in 1905, too.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.108
She even had
business cards...

27:59.143 --> 28:00.877
...that said "Lizbeth of Maplecroft."

28:00.912 --> 28:02.678
So she kind of was trying

28:02.713 --> 28:05.115
to reinvent herself
at that point.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.518
Even in her instructions
on burial --

28:07.553 --> 28:09.953
she wrote them out.

28:09.988 --> 28:13.858
She wanted her name as Lizbeth
on her stone.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.125
- Her stone does say "Lizbeth."
- It does say "Lizbeth." - Yeah.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.326
Interesting, okay.

28:17.361 --> 28:19.330
Is she buried with
her family or...

28:19.365 --> 28:20.964
Yes, she instructed

28:20.999 --> 28:23.601
that she be buried
at her father's foot.

28:23.636 --> 28:24.800
Interesting.

28:24.835 --> 28:27.537
So much drama in the Borden house.

28:27.572 --> 28:29.306
It's not because
of the horrible murder.

28:29.307 --> 28:31.242
We see those in the papers
all the time.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.075
- It's the mystery.
- Yeah.

28:33.110 --> 28:34.879
Thank you so much
for all this.

28:34.914 --> 28:37.546
- We're gonna keep digging.
- Alright, good luck. - As always...

28:37.581 --> 28:39.382
- Let me know how it turns out.
- Yes.

28:39.417 --> 28:40.818
Thank you so much.
Appreciate your help.

28:40.853 --> 28:43.520
And remember --
Lizbeth.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.554
- We're trying to narrow down
who was at Maplecroft. - Exactly.

28:45.589 --> 28:48.657
- And, I mean, I think our gut
is that it's Lizzie. - Right.

28:48.692 --> 28:50.427
I think from
talking to him,

28:50.462 --> 28:52.162
when she said
"Lizzie Borden,"

28:52.197 --> 28:54.130
it was a sassy response.
- Listen to it.

28:55.833 --> 28:57.952
It can't be.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.029
My God!

28:59.064 --> 29:00.036
It can't be.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.437
It can't be, right?

29:01.472 --> 29:04.108
We are seen as those outsiders
that are coming in.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.744
She's like, "You're looking
for Lizzie Borden.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.044
You're not looking
for Lizbeth."

29:08.045 --> 29:11.981
Which is who she became in 1905,
you know?

29:12.016 --> 29:14.485
She, like, changed over her life
completely, right?

29:14.520 --> 29:16.954
So we now have to do something
that she doesn't expect,

29:16.989 --> 29:21.056
which is approach her
as Lizbeth.

29:21.091 --> 29:26.197
I think us going in there,
talking to Lizbeth, right?

29:26.232 --> 29:29.766
That person is who
we should be talking to.

29:29.767 --> 29:31.335
So, we don't even bring up
the murders tonight.

29:31.370 --> 29:32.434
No. Not at all.

29:32.469 --> 29:34.004
And anything that involves
the murders --

29:34.039 --> 29:36.391
the ax upstairs,
the crazy books --

29:36.426 --> 29:38.819
let's put them away.
Take them out.

29:38.854 --> 29:41.177
- And let's make like
a scene of it. - Yeah.

29:41.212 --> 29:44.048
Let's, like, make a moment of,
like, "You know what?

29:44.083 --> 29:45.616
We're gonna take all this
out of the house...

29:45.651 --> 29:47.049
...'cause this does not
define you." - Right.

29:47.084 --> 29:48.517
I think that's a great idea.

29:48.552 --> 29:51.655
We've been addressing
the wrong person

29:51.690 --> 29:54.108
this entire investigation.

29:54.143 --> 29:56.492
That's why names are key.

29:56.527 --> 29:59.831
We should have reached out
to <i> Lizbeth,</i> not <i> Lizzie.</i>

29:59.866 --> 30:01.764
Amy and I need to make
her comfortable

30:01.765 --> 30:03.800
if we hope
to get any answers.

30:03.835 --> 30:06.469
We need to make this feel
like her home.

30:06.504 --> 30:09.106
So, right now, we are
going through Maplecroft

30:09.141 --> 30:10.573
and we're taking out

30:10.608 --> 30:14.110
anything that pertains
to the murders,

30:14.111 --> 30:16.980
because we're gonna make it
an ax-murder-free zone

30:17.015 --> 30:20.417
because Lizbeth would not have
had anything like that here.

30:20.452 --> 30:23.120
Lizbeth, we're getting rid
of all the horrible things

30:23.155 --> 30:26.624
that talk about
what happened on Second Street

30:26.659 --> 30:30.094
because you don't need to be
reminded of that.

30:32.997 --> 30:37.100
This is, like, articles
about Lizzie in jail.

30:37.135 --> 30:41.572
This is, like, artist renderings
of her during the trial.

30:41.607 --> 30:45.776
Alright.
So here we have an ax.

30:50.814 --> 30:53.718
"America's Murder Houses."

30:53.753 --> 30:55.587
This can go.

30:55.622 --> 30:57.421
Take this out.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.429
I found this
newspaper article.

31:06.464 --> 31:09.066
Really?
There's an article in there?

31:09.101 --> 31:11.668
Yeah, "The Butchery of Yesterday
and Yet..."

31:11.703 --> 31:12.968
God.
Let's get it all out.

31:13.003 --> 31:15.539
Let's go put it in the back
of the car for tonight.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.075
Alright, Lizbeth, we're gonna
take this all outside,

31:18.110 --> 31:20.278
keep it out of the house
for tonight.

31:23.881 --> 31:25.982
Before we reach out
to Lizzie again,

31:26.017 --> 31:29.720
we're setting up a unique
and non-threatening experiment.

31:29.755 --> 31:32.556
The goal is to make her
as comfortable as possible,

31:32.591 --> 31:34.791
so Adam and I are separating.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.793
I'm hoping to hear
Lizzie's thoughts

31:36.828 --> 31:38.160
through my Spirit Box,

31:38.195 --> 31:39.963
while Adam asks her questions

31:39.998 --> 31:41.764
via his walkie-talkie.

31:41.799 --> 31:44.068
I won't hear a single word
he says,

31:44.103 --> 31:45.602
but the crew will.

31:45.637 --> 31:46.669
Even though I can't see him,

31:46.704 --> 31:48.204
I'm still gonna put
the blindfold on

31:48.239 --> 31:51.942
just because there is something
to that sensory depravation

31:51.977 --> 31:55.411
where it makes you focus more

31:55.446 --> 31:57.046
on what the Spirit Box
is saying.

31:57.081 --> 32:00.783
So all I'm going to sense,
hear, experience

32:00.784 --> 32:02.653
is whatever I'm hearing
through my ears

32:02.688 --> 32:03.819
through that Spirit Box.

32:03.854 --> 32:05.756
There's no one
on the second floor.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.858
Even our camera crew vacated.

32:07.893 --> 32:09.226
It's just me.

32:09.227 --> 32:10.292
Alone.

32:10.327 --> 32:12.697
Alright, I'm going
under right now.

32:16.500 --> 32:20.036
My friend Amy is upstairs.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.872
I'm hoping that you can
talk to her, please.

32:21.907 --> 32:23.674
<i> I'd love for you
to reach out to her</i>

32:23.709 --> 32:25.643
<i> and say something to her.</i>

32:25.678 --> 32:27.578
Could you tell me your name,
please,

32:27.613 --> 32:29.563
anyone who's in that room...

32:29.598 --> 32:31.514
<i> with my friend Amy?</i>

32:31.515 --> 32:33.718
<i> Can you tell me your name?</i>

32:37.223 --> 32:40.391
Lizbeth.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.628
- We were having a conversation
with Lizbeth. - Yes.

32:45.663 --> 32:47.431
Like, for real.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.098
I could...

32:49.133 --> 32:51.066
I could feel her
up here.

32:51.101 --> 32:52.870
We're talking
to Lizzie Borden.

33:02.279 --> 33:04.949
Amy and I adjusted
our investigative approach,

33:04.984 --> 33:06.549
and it's working.

33:06.584 --> 33:08.585
Could you tell me your name,
please,

33:08.620 --> 33:10.187
anyone who's in that room?

33:12.258 --> 33:16.427
Lizbeth.

33:20.597 --> 33:23.234
<i> Lizbeth, you're gonna have
a lot of people come in here</i>

33:23.269 --> 33:25.534
and try to talk to you,

33:25.569 --> 33:27.204
and most of those people
are gonna talk about --

33:27.239 --> 33:28.939
Directly?

33:28.974 --> 33:30.640
<i> Yes.</i>

33:30.641 --> 33:32.509
They're gonna talk
to you directly.

33:32.544 --> 33:35.845
I'm lost.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.781
<i> So, the people
that own this house now</i>

33:37.816 --> 33:40.216
also own the house --

33:40.217 --> 33:41.617
Don't say anything.

33:44.023 --> 33:46.088
It's not me.

33:46.123 --> 33:47.558
People are gonna ask you
about what happened

33:47.593 --> 33:51.060
at Second Street.

33:51.095 --> 33:53.997
We're trying to warn you
and let you know

33:54.032 --> 33:57.034
to see if that's okay with you.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.301
Please talk to them.

33:59.336 --> 34:03.374
She really wants nothing
to do with her past.

34:03.409 --> 34:04.640
Are you there?

34:04.675 --> 34:07.109
<i> Yes.
Sorry. Sorry.</i>

34:07.144 --> 34:09.080
<i> So you're saying it's okay
for people to come in here</i>

34:09.114 --> 34:11.081
<i> and talk to you
about your past?</i>

34:11.116 --> 34:12.300
Come back.

34:12.335 --> 34:13.484
I'm here.

34:17.353 --> 34:21.158
What would you like
to talk about, Lizbeth?

34:21.193 --> 34:23.426
Is somebody
walking in here?

34:29.065 --> 34:32.335
Sorry, it seems like someone's
walking in here.

34:34.839 --> 34:37.574
<i> Do you miss someone,
Lizbeth?</i>

34:37.609 --> 34:39.577
<i> From your past?</i>

34:39.612 --> 34:41.545
You get used to it.

34:43.746 --> 34:45.514
I'm upset.

34:47.484 --> 34:49.886
What are you
upset about?

34:49.887 --> 34:51.987
Stop.

34:52.022 --> 34:56.192
Anyone else in the house,
Lizbeth, besides you?

34:56.193 --> 34:57.994
Stop it.

34:58.029 --> 35:01.132
Okay.
Thank you, Lizbeth.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.385
Alone.

35:03.420 --> 35:06.713
I tried.

35:09.363 --> 35:11.908
Hey. Hey.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.242
Hey.

35:13.277 --> 35:15.512
Sorry, I wanted to, like,
stop you for...

35:15.547 --> 35:16.447
My God. I was --

35:16.482 --> 35:17.313
That was so long,

35:17.348 --> 35:19.047
and so I wanted
to make sure that...

35:19.082 --> 35:22.752
I was honestly real creeped out
in here by myself.

35:22.753 --> 35:24.152
Like, I had a really --

35:24.187 --> 35:27.589
- You know that feeling like
someone's right behind you? - Yeah.

35:27.624 --> 35:30.259
And then there was one point...

35:30.294 --> 35:33.529
...where I felt footsteps walking
through the room. - Okay.

35:33.564 --> 35:35.566
I was in the DVR, watching you,
listening to you,

35:35.601 --> 35:37.667
and nothing moved
in the room.

35:37.702 --> 35:39.370
And I couldn't see --
Like, I was, like,

35:39.405 --> 35:41.436
so blinded by this,
I couldn't see.

35:41.471 --> 35:42.940
And I'm like, "Is someone
in here with me?"

35:42.975 --> 35:44.540
- 'Cause it was, like...
- Right.

35:44.575 --> 35:45.726
So you didn't
hear footsteps?

35:45.761 --> 35:46.842
- Nope. I didn't hear footsteps.
- So weird.

35:46.877 --> 35:48.077
Especially 'cause

35:48.112 --> 35:49.513
I was listening
to the audio on your mic,

35:49.548 --> 35:51.013
so I didn't pick up
the footsteps.

35:51.048 --> 35:53.682
- It was the feel of, like,
somebody walking. - Right.

35:53.717 --> 35:55.886
I was hearing, like,
full sentences, by the way.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.221
Right.
Which never happens.

35:57.256 --> 35:57.822
No.

35:57.857 --> 35:58.353
Yeah.

35:58.388 --> 36:00.557
Very distinct...

36:00.592 --> 36:02.426
female voice.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.228
Not a big voice.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.996
Like, kind of a...

36:06.031 --> 36:07.281
light voice,

36:07.316 --> 36:08.497
but female.

36:08.532 --> 36:12.202
She just seemed
so conflicted

36:12.237 --> 36:15.706
and lonely and, like...

36:15.741 --> 36:16.839
And not shy.

36:16.874 --> 36:18.174
- Like, she's a talker.
- No.

36:18.209 --> 36:20.477
Like, she...
Man.

36:20.478 --> 36:23.214
So, right off the bat, I said,
"Can you tell me your name?"

36:23.249 --> 36:25.266
And immediately,
you said, "Lizbeth."

36:25.301 --> 36:27.284
Yeah, I heard the name
"Lizbeth."

36:27.319 --> 36:29.352
Well,
my face said it all.

36:29.387 --> 36:30.888
I said, "They're gonna
talk to you in the house."

36:30.923 --> 36:32.888
- You said, "Directly?"
- Weird.

36:32.923 --> 36:34.558
And I was like, "Yes, they're
gonna talk to you directly."

36:34.593 --> 36:35.791
You're like, "I'm lost.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.027
Like, I don't understand
what you're talking about."

36:37.062 --> 36:38.729
And I said, "Okay,
so they're coming in here

36:38.764 --> 36:40.348
and they're gonna
come in here

36:40.383 --> 36:42.075
and talk to you
about your past,"

36:42.110 --> 36:43.767
and you said,
"Don't say anything."

36:43.768 --> 36:45.268
And you go,
"It's not me."

36:45.303 --> 36:47.138
Like, as if to say
whatever happened

36:47.173 --> 36:48.503
in the past
was not you, right?

36:48.538 --> 36:50.340
I said, "What would you like
to talk about?"

36:50.375 --> 36:52.107
And then that's when
you heard the footsteps.

36:52.142 --> 36:54.977
- I mean, we were having
a conversation with Lizbeth. - Yes.

36:55.012 --> 36:56.947
Like, for real.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.613
I could...

36:58.648 --> 37:01.216
I could feel her
up here.

37:01.251 --> 37:02.786
We're talking
to Lizzie Borden.

37:05.655 --> 37:07.556
And that is creepy.
That's crazy.

37:07.591 --> 37:09.393
I mean, I can't --
I mean, do you understa--

37:09.428 --> 37:11.593
Do you guys get it?

37:11.628 --> 37:14.431
I mean, we're talking
to Lizbeth.

37:14.466 --> 37:15.530
I mean...

37:15.565 --> 37:16.933
People have searched

37:16.968 --> 37:20.770
for decades
and decades,

37:20.771 --> 37:22.706
and I don't know of anyone
that's ever actually

37:22.741 --> 37:24.608
talked to Lizzie Borden.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.544
That is insane.

37:26.579 --> 37:28.777
Yeah.

37:28.812 --> 37:30.413
We know
who's in this house,

37:30.448 --> 37:33.951
and I don't think anybody
expected to what level.

37:33.986 --> 37:36.454
This is not just some

37:36.489 --> 37:38.888
residual-type haunting.

37:38.923 --> 37:43.093
Like, Lizzie Borden --
Lizbeth Borden --

37:43.128 --> 37:45.245
lives in this house,

37:45.280 --> 37:47.363
and she is ever-present.

37:47.364 --> 37:49.831
The historical
significance here,

37:49.866 --> 37:52.200
the ghostly significance
here is huge,

37:52.235 --> 37:54.204
and it's a big undertaking
they've taken on,

37:54.239 --> 37:56.672
and it's a big
responsibility.

37:56.707 --> 37:58.709
And so, hopefully,
we'll be able to give them,

37:58.744 --> 38:00.810
like, the beginning
of some guidance...

38:00.811 --> 38:03.329
...that will set them
down the path...

38:03.364 --> 38:05.814
...of keeping this place
kind of level. - Yeah.

38:05.849 --> 38:08.284
Bottom line -- 100%,

38:08.319 --> 38:10.988
we found the ghost
of Lizzie Borden.

38:11.023 --> 38:13.221
- Like, we found her.
- Yeah.

38:13.256 --> 38:17.027
This is one of the first
investigations of many.

38:17.062 --> 38:20.363
It's clear to us that
Lizzie Borden is still here,

38:20.398 --> 38:22.264
and it's safe for now.

38:22.299 --> 38:24.968
We have learned that the second
we bring up the murders,

38:25.003 --> 38:29.205
the activity stops,
or Lizzie stops talking to us.

38:29.206 --> 38:30.573
And so that's why

38:30.608 --> 38:33.143
we just don't delve
very far into it

38:33.178 --> 38:34.210
while we're in this house.

38:34.245 --> 38:36.177
It's out of respect,
and also we know

38:36.212 --> 38:39.850
that going down that road
does not give us any results.

38:39.885 --> 38:43.254
It's time to tell Deb
the best course of action.

38:44.855 --> 38:45.854
- Hey.
- How are you?

38:45.889 --> 38:47.691
How are you?
Good to see you again.

38:47.726 --> 38:48.675
Welcome back.

38:48.710 --> 38:49.625
Thanks.

38:49.626 --> 38:52.328
We've had quite an eventful
three days here.

38:52.363 --> 38:55.031
I don't think we've ever
left an investigation

38:55.066 --> 38:58.335
as connected
with whatever's here

38:58.370 --> 39:00.101
as we are right now.

39:00.136 --> 39:02.504
So, we had Chip come over.

39:02.539 --> 39:06.944
And we blindfolded him,
so he had no idea where he was.

39:06.979 --> 39:12.549
And immediately,
he picked up on Lizzie Borden.

39:12.584 --> 39:14.417
He just said it was
a woman energy

39:14.452 --> 39:16.485
who was frantic.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.054
We really got a taste
of her personality.

39:19.089 --> 39:29.564
- And so the second night, we got
a very distinct EVP. - Liz-beth.

39:29.599 --> 39:31.067
Liz-beth,

39:31.102 --> 39:33.036
She split it.
Yeah.

39:33.071 --> 39:33.936
That's awesome.

39:33.971 --> 39:35.372
Yeah.
She's very clear.

39:35.407 --> 39:36.774
Like, "Liz-beth."

39:36.809 --> 39:37.392
Yeah.

39:37.975 --> 39:41.610
We figured,
"Okay, Lizbeth Borden is here,"

39:41.645 --> 39:43.780
and she's really clear
that she likes to be called

39:43.815 --> 39:45.314
Lizbeth, by the way.

39:45.349 --> 39:48.317
So we experimented
with this idea

39:48.352 --> 39:50.787
that we wanted
to make her comfortable.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.821
And so the first thing
we did --

39:52.856 --> 39:54.791
we went through,
and we made a big spectacle,

39:54.826 --> 39:56.758
and we said, "Lizbeth,

39:56.793 --> 39:59.329
we are taking everything
out of this house...

39:59.364 --> 40:00.729
...that has anything to do...

40:00.764 --> 40:02.164
...with what happened
at the other house." - Right.

40:02.199 --> 40:03.732
That's amazing.

40:03.767 --> 40:05.301
So, we do something --

40:05.336 --> 40:07.004
we call it, like,
the Spirit Box experiment --

40:07.039 --> 40:08.204
where basically,

40:08.239 --> 40:10.507
one of us wears
noise-canceling headphones

40:10.542 --> 40:12.007
and listens
to the Spirit Box.

40:12.042 --> 40:15.479
And we wear a blindfold,
so we're like sensory deprived.

40:15.514 --> 40:18.247
And he would ask the questions
through the walkie.

40:18.248 --> 40:23.754
And so we had, probably,
a solid 12-minute conversation...

40:23.789 --> 40:25.253
...with Lizzie Borden.
- Lizbeth.

40:25.288 --> 40:26.957
Lizbeth Borden.

40:26.992 --> 40:27.956
Yeah.

40:27.991 --> 40:30.126
And you see her
character traits.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.812
There are moments
when she's chatty,

40:31.847 --> 40:34.056
and there's moments
when she's happy.

40:34.091 --> 40:36.266
And then immediately,
almost on the dime,

40:36.301 --> 40:37.366
she's upset,

40:37.401 --> 40:38.801
and she doesn't want
to talk about it

40:38.802 --> 40:40.469
and she's
"Leave me alone."

40:40.504 --> 40:42.237
We're just trying to think of,
like, the long run

40:42.272 --> 40:45.709
and what you can do here to,
one, stop this from escalating,

40:45.744 --> 40:47.108
because if people
start coming in

40:47.143 --> 40:50.147
and bringing up
uncomfortable things for her,

40:50.182 --> 40:52.947
the activity could
start ramping up.

40:52.982 --> 40:56.618
- And so you do kind of want her
to remain comfortable. - Exactly.

40:56.653 --> 40:59.020
So, we just feel
like in the long run,

40:59.055 --> 41:01.424
it's important that everybody
that come here,

41:01.425 --> 41:03.026
if they're going
to investigate,

41:03.061 --> 41:04.627
do so very respectfully

41:04.662 --> 41:07.263
and with the idea
that this was her sanctuary,

41:07.264 --> 41:09.198
and it still is.

41:09.233 --> 41:12.119
So, we think that
the best thing to do --

41:12.154 --> 41:15.005
we have a whole box
of anything in the house

41:15.040 --> 41:16.772
that had to do
with the murders.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.108
We should just get it
out of the house,

41:18.143 --> 41:19.460
because I think
that's the one thing

41:19.495 --> 41:20.743
that's uncomfortable
for her here.

41:20.778 --> 41:24.046
But otherwise, it's all
on the people who come in here

41:24.047 --> 41:28.218
to handle it respectfully,
know where her headspace is,

41:28.253 --> 41:31.153
know that Lizbeth Borden
is in this house. - Right.

41:31.188 --> 41:33.340
She is a very strong person,
you know?

41:33.375 --> 41:35.457
She's entrusted us with this house...

41:35.492 --> 41:37.361
...and we want to make sure
she's comfortable.

41:37.396 --> 41:38.493
This was her sanctuary.

41:38.528 --> 41:40.529
So you kind of hit it
right on the head.

41:40.530 --> 41:41.664
But this is
just awesome.

41:41.699 --> 41:45.468
You guys did an amazing job.
I'm so impressed.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.735
Thank you.

41:46.770 --> 41:49.607
This was a monumental
investigation,

41:49.642 --> 41:51.608
and as paranormal investigators,

41:51.643 --> 41:53.608
a legendary milestone.

41:53.643 --> 41:55.444
We're the first to ever connect

41:55.479 --> 41:57.731
with Lizzie Borden
in the afterlife.

41:57.766 --> 41:59.984
This home might have
been her sanctuary,

42:00.019 --> 42:02.420
but that's about to change.

42:02.455 --> 42:04.821
The question is,
will she?

42:05.305 --> 42:11.878
