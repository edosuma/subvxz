01:14.166 --> 01:17.250
Everyone, everyone!
I found the buffalo herd.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.418
They're all safe and sound.

01:18.454 --> 01:20.370
Yep.
There they are.

01:21.457 --> 01:23.090
Good work, Ono.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.292
Hmm. Why do you suppose
they wandered so far

01:25.344 --> 01:27.127
from their regular grazing ground?

01:27.129 --> 01:30.380
Who cares? We found them,
they're fine, let's go.

01:30.432 --> 01:32.516
Wait.
I'm not so sure they are fine.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.134
Look where they're grazing.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.271
<i>Hapana!</i>

01:38.307 --> 01:39.882
They're right
on top of a geyser!

01:39.917 --> 01:41.358
- A what?
- A geyser.

01:41.393 --> 01:44.277
Really hot water shooting up
from a hole in the ground.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.480
Are you sure you're not
making that up?

01:48.317 --> 01:51.318
Whoa. Big B, you gotta
eat something.

01:51.370 --> 01:54.454
That stomach of yours
is rumbling like crazy!

01:54.490 --> 01:57.290
I don't think
that's my stomach.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.127
It's the geyser!

02:00.162 --> 02:01.294
It's about to blow!

02:01.330 --> 02:03.163
We've gotta warn
the buffalo!

02:03.165 --> 02:04.498
Till the Pride Lands' end...

02:04.500 --> 02:06.383
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

02:14.560 --> 02:16.343
Whoa!

02:18.564 --> 02:20.480
<i>Heyvi kabisa!
The herd!</i>

02:23.235 --> 02:24.351
We've gotta stop them

02:24.403 --> 02:26.436
before they trample
everything in their path!

02:26.488 --> 02:29.072
<i>Leave this to me!
Huwezi!</i>

02:29.108 --> 02:30.407
She can't do it alone.
C'mon!

02:33.245 --> 02:35.078
Slow it down, buffalo!

02:36.165 --> 02:37.114
That's the way.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.284
Nice and easy...

02:44.540 --> 02:46.506
Would ya look at that.

02:46.542 --> 02:49.259
Wow! Maybe she can
do it alone!

02:52.381 --> 02:54.097
<i>Poa, Fuli!</i>

02:54.133 --> 02:55.515
That was un-Bunga-lievable!

02:55.551 --> 02:57.217
Thanks.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.136
You should have
seen it from up there!

02:59.188 --> 03:01.388
Great work, Fuli.
Now why don't you take a break?

03:01.440 --> 03:03.390
Help! Help!

03:03.392 --> 03:05.058
And the break's over.

03:05.110 --> 03:07.394
It's gonna be one of those days.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.062
Ono, take a look.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.063
Affirmative!

03:10.482 --> 03:13.066
Help!

03:13.569 --> 03:15.118
<i>Hapana!</i>

03:15.154 --> 03:16.319
Ono, what do ya got?

03:16.371 --> 03:17.404
Three galagos!

03:17.406 --> 03:20.457
About to fall from a tree
in Ndefu Grove!

03:20.492 --> 03:22.075
We'd better get moving.

03:22.127 --> 03:23.243
I got this!

03:23.295 --> 03:26.213
Help! Help!

03:26.248 --> 03:27.464
Don't let go!
Don't let go!

03:28.333 --> 03:29.416
I can't hold on.

03:29.468 --> 03:31.301
I can't hold on!

03:34.256 --> 03:36.089
Hang on!

03:38.427 --> 03:39.392
Gotcha!

03:44.149 --> 03:45.398
<i>Poa, Fuli!</i>

03:45.434 --> 03:46.516
Nice save!

03:46.568 --> 03:48.485
Good thing you didn't
need any backup.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.237
You left us
in the dust.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.572
Yeah, I knew I could handle
this one by myself.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.357
But, uh...

03:54.409 --> 03:57.277
I could use some help
getting these things off me.

03:57.329 --> 03:59.279
All right,
Gally-ally-goes.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.330
Off 'a the kitty!

04:05.287 --> 04:09.039
I still feel those teeny
little hands grabbing my fur.

04:09.091 --> 04:13.126
- You sure you got them all?
- Yeah, you're good.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.378
<i>Zuka zama! Lookit!</i>

04:15.430 --> 04:18.180
The water's reached
the trees at Mapema Rock!

04:18.216 --> 04:20.466
<i>Poa! You're right, Bunga!</i>

04:20.519 --> 04:23.470
That means... Uh...
What does that mean?

04:23.472 --> 04:26.356
It means it's the peak
of the rainy season!

04:26.391 --> 04:28.475
<i>It's time for utamu!</i>

04:28.527 --> 04:32.279
- I've gotta go get some!
- Bunga, wait! Where are you going?

04:33.232 --> 04:34.314
I just told ya.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.316
<i>I'm gettin' utamu!</i>

04:36.318 --> 04:39.319
They're the rarest, most
delicious grubs in the Pride Lands!

04:39.371 --> 04:42.322
But they only come out one day
at the peak of the rainy season!

04:42.374 --> 04:44.324
So you gotta
find 'em fast!

04:44.326 --> 04:46.293
That's why...

04:47.212 --> 04:48.411
What is up today?

04:48.463 --> 04:50.547
Sounds like somebody
else is in trouble.

04:52.301 --> 04:54.134
It's a serval!

04:54.169 --> 04:56.503
Looks like he tried
to jump across Big Ravine!

04:56.555 --> 04:59.339
He's hanging on to the edge,
but he won't last long!

04:59.341 --> 05:00.340
Thanks, Ono!

05:00.342 --> 05:02.309
Lion Guard...

05:02.344 --> 05:03.343
Fuli?

05:09.518 --> 05:11.151
Hang on!

05:21.530 --> 05:23.446
Don't panic.
I've got you.

05:23.498 --> 05:26.032
I hope.

05:29.254 --> 05:31.171
Hey!
Calm down!

05:31.206 --> 05:32.339
I'm sorry!
I'm...

05:32.374 --> 05:34.090
I'm scared!

05:34.126 --> 05:37.210
Yeah, well I can't help you get
up the cliff if you kick me off it!

05:38.513 --> 05:40.046
Got it.

05:40.098 --> 05:41.381
Now just one...

05:41.383 --> 05:43.350
More... Push!

05:46.305 --> 05:47.470
I'm out!

05:49.224 --> 05:50.273
You did it!

05:50.309 --> 05:52.225
Thank you!

05:55.447 --> 05:57.230
No problem.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.149
Great rescue, Fuli!

06:01.069 --> 06:04.120
What took the rest of you so long?

06:04.156 --> 06:06.072
We went around the long way.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.409
Yeah. Even I wouldn't try
a crazy jump like that!

06:09.411 --> 06:12.245
Just takes a little speed, that's all.

06:12.297 --> 06:15.415
- Fuli. Why didn't you wait for us?
- C'mon, Kion.

06:15.467 --> 06:17.467
You put me on the Guard
'cause I'm the fastest.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.170
If my speed can help,
shouldn't I use it?

06:20.222 --> 06:21.471
Yeah, but we're a team.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.256
And our team's not as good

06:23.258 --> 06:26.092
if you get hurt or worn out
from going solo.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.260
I'm a cheetah.

06:27.312 --> 06:29.145
Cheetahs don't get worn out.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.064
Actually, Fuli, cheetahs do...

06:32.317 --> 06:36.186
Uh, well, maybe
you don't get worn out?

06:37.572 --> 06:39.522
Well, now that that's settled,

06:39.574 --> 06:42.275
<i>I gotta go find
the utamu grubs.</i>

06:42.277 --> 06:45.078
- You comin' or not?
- I'm in. Let's go!

06:45.113 --> 06:48.248
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I think you need to rest.

06:48.283 --> 06:51.368
If anything else happens,
we'll need you at full strength.

06:51.420 --> 06:53.370
I'm sorry, have we met?

06:53.422 --> 06:56.456
I'm Fuli. I'm always
at full strength.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.124
I mean it, Fuli.

06:58.176 --> 07:00.126
You need to take
it easy for a while.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.428
I want you to stay here.

07:03.515 --> 07:08.018
I think Kion's trying to say that
everybody needs to rest sometimes.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.303
Fine. I'll rest.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.471
But I won't like it.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.223
Wouldn't expect you to.

07:13.275 --> 07:16.026
<i>So, Bunga.
These utamu grubs.</i>

07:16.061 --> 07:17.310
Do you know where to find them?

07:17.312 --> 07:19.312
Do I? Do I?

07:20.148 --> 07:24.117
Do I? Yes!
Yes, I totally do!

07:24.152 --> 07:26.486
- This way!
- See you later, Fuli!

07:26.488 --> 07:28.238
Bye.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.057
Resting? Hunting?

- Really? Why's that?

of grubs under it.

Can we keep him?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.337
Keep him?
No. No more kids.

11:54.389 --> 11:56.422
We already raised
a lion, remember?

11:56.474 --> 11:59.509
Besides, he's a honey badger.
He can fend for himself!

11:59.561 --> 12:03.146
So long, kid.
Thanks for the grub!

12:03.181 --> 12:07.350
Oh, I think he wants
to be with us, too!

12:07.402 --> 12:09.352
We'll see about that.

12:09.404 --> 12:11.487
<i>Then Timon asked me
to find the rarest,</i>

12:11.523 --> 12:15.525
- most delicious grubs in the Pride Lands.
- Utamu!

12:15.577 --> 12:17.410
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

12:19.581 --> 12:21.364
He's really doing it!

12:21.416 --> 12:24.250
I was sure he'd be too
scared and just run away.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.502
I don't think he's
afraid of anything, Timon.

12:26.538 --> 12:30.289
Yeah. The kid's loopier
than a snake squeezin' his supper.

12:30.342 --> 12:34.460
<i>Or as they say in the
Serengeti, he's bunga!</i>

12:34.462 --> 12:35.511
Bunga, Bunga, Bunga!

12:35.547 --> 12:38.181
Would ya look at that.
He got 'em!

12:38.216 --> 12:39.465
<i>He got the utamu!</i>

12:39.467 --> 12:43.381
- Now can we keep him, Timon?
- Can we?

12:43.416 --> 12:47.223
The little Bunga got us the most
delicious grubs in the Pride Lands!

12:47.275 --> 12:48.558
How can we not?

12:48.610 --> 12:52.445
C'mon, Bunga!
From now on, you're with us!

12:52.480 --> 12:55.198
Mmm!

12:55.233 --> 12:59.118
So now, at the peak of every
rainy season, we celebrate.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.486
<i>I always bring
the utamu.</i>

13:00.538 --> 13:02.155
My uncles love 'em!

13:02.207 --> 13:03.489
And I don't want
to let them down.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.209
Aw, Little B.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.294
That was beautiful!

13:08.329 --> 13:09.462
Don't worry, Bunga.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.081
<i>We'll help you get
that utamu. Right, guys?</i>

13:12.133 --> 13:15.385
Yes. But, uh, the dung beetles
aren't going to help.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.502
They're gone.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.504
Say what?

13:18.506 --> 13:21.257
<i>So how are we going
to find the utamu now?</i>

13:21.309 --> 13:22.341
Hmm.

13:22.394 --> 13:25.311
<i>I see the tree!
Zuka Zama!</i>

13:25.346 --> 13:27.180
C'mon!

13:27.232 --> 13:29.348
Too bad Fuli didn't
get to hear Bunga's story.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.485
Yeah. But it's good that
she's getting some rest.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.104
Are we getting close?

13:35.156 --> 13:36.322
Pretty close!

13:41.413 --> 13:43.529
Ugh.
What about now?

13:43.531 --> 13:45.448
Mmm. Pretty close!

13:50.288 --> 13:52.205
How much farther?

13:52.207 --> 13:53.539
Oh, we're pretty close now!

14:00.515 --> 14:02.181
Fuli!

14:02.217 --> 14:04.133
I know, I know!

14:04.185 --> 14:05.268
We're pretty close!

14:05.303 --> 14:07.386
No, we're here now!
Look!

14:17.449 --> 14:19.365
Can you stop them?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.400
You better believe it.

14:21.453 --> 14:24.153
Oryxes!

14:24.205 --> 14:25.455
Get out of here!
Now!

14:30.378 --> 14:32.495
You did it!

14:32.547 --> 14:34.413
You saved our nests!

14:34.466 --> 14:35.548
Thanks!

14:35.583 --> 14:37.250
No problem.

14:37.252 --> 14:40.086
I'm just gonna...
Head out now.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.521
Before we bring the meeting
of this committee to order...

14:58.573 --> 15:03.409
Please join me in the singing
of our parliamentary anthem.

16:06.140 --> 16:07.223
That was good.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.260
Oi, is that Fuli
lying down there?

16:11.312 --> 16:13.512
I've never seen her
when she wasn't running.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.231
What's wrong with her?

16:15.266 --> 16:19.101
Hmm. It seems Fuli is too
young to know her limits.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.320
Ya mean she
don't know cheetahs

16:21.356 --> 16:24.407
can only run for so long
before they need a rest?

16:24.442 --> 16:26.108
Precisely.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.444
I conclude she's
pushed herself too hard,

16:28.496 --> 16:31.197
and currently has
no energy at all.

16:31.249 --> 16:35.201
Which means
she can't fight back.

16:35.203 --> 16:37.829
Oh, should we form a
subcommittee to discuss our

16:37.830 --> 16:40.456
options in attacking Fuli in
her current weakened state?

16:40.508 --> 16:43.092
Actually, I think
this is the one time

16:43.127 --> 16:46.045
that we dispense with formal
parliamentary procedures...

16:46.097 --> 16:49.215
And simply attack.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.468
<i>Is this really the tree where you
first found the utamu, Little B?</i>

16:52.520 --> 16:54.353
Sure is!

16:54.389 --> 16:56.305
Now all I have to do
is climb up and get 'em!

16:56.357 --> 16:57.440
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

16:59.193 --> 17:00.309
Careful, Bunga!

17:00.361 --> 17:02.144
That tree looks pretty dead!

17:02.196 --> 17:05.114
I know!
That's why grubs love living in it!

17:11.289 --> 17:13.289
<i>I'm comin' for you, utamu!</i>

17:14.375 --> 17:17.076
Bunga, that branch is rotten!

17:17.127 --> 17:18.377
I don't think it'll hold you!

17:18.413 --> 17:20.079
Sure it will!

17:22.416 --> 17:24.083
He's gonna need our help.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.085
Ono, steady the end
of that branch.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.420
Beshte, hold the trunk.

17:27.422 --> 17:28.421
Sure thing!

17:33.261 --> 17:36.429
Hey ya, Ono.
I'm almost there... Whoa!

17:36.431 --> 17:38.397
<i>Hapana.</i>

17:38.433 --> 17:41.067
Kion!
Mzingo and his vultures!

17:41.102 --> 17:42.184
They're circling!

17:42.236 --> 17:43.319
That's never good.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.104
We need to check it out.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.523
Ono, Beshte, Bunga, let's go!

17:47.575 --> 17:50.076
Wait!
Just one more step!

17:51.446 --> 17:53.496
I'm coming, Bunga!
No!

17:53.531 --> 17:55.114
<i>My utamu!</i>

17:55.166 --> 17:57.199
Incoming, Beshte!
Got it!

17:58.453 --> 18:02.121
- You okay, Little B?
- Yeah. I guess.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.456
Sorry, Bunga.

18:03.458 --> 18:06.292
But we gotta go see what Mzingo
and his vultures are up to.

18:06.294 --> 18:10.262
- Yeah, I know.
- Ono, keep an eye out for Fuli.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.380
We'll need her if there's trouble.

18:11.432 --> 18:13.466
If I know Fuli, she's already there.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.397
Back off, vultures.

18:28.449 --> 18:30.366
You don't want any part of me.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.368
Oh, but I believe we do.

18:32.403 --> 18:34.120
I want a leg!

18:34.155 --> 18:35.237
Young cheetah.

18:35.289 --> 18:38.207
You have so little
energy right now,

18:38.242 --> 18:40.209
you couldn't attack
us if you tried.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.161
Oh, um, question.

18:42.213 --> 18:44.330
You really think
she can't fight back?

18:44.332 --> 18:46.499
Just try me!

18:46.501 --> 18:50.086
If you had any strength,
you'd have pounced by now.

18:50.138 --> 18:52.338
All in favor of attacking
from all sides, hmm?

18:52.340 --> 18:53.422
Aye!

18:53.474 --> 18:55.174
All opposed?

18:56.094 --> 18:59.345
Motion passed.
The ayes have it.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.347
No sign of Fuli, Ono?

19:01.399 --> 19:03.349
We sure could use
her on this one.

19:03.401 --> 19:05.267
No, nothing. I...

19:05.319 --> 19:06.435
Oh, no!

19:06.487 --> 19:08.104
It's Fuli!

19:10.108 --> 19:11.273
She's down...

19:11.325 --> 19:13.242
And she's surrounded
by vultures!

19:13.277 --> 19:15.111
<i>Heyvi kabisa!</i>

19:15.163 --> 19:17.196
To the Pride Lands' end...

19:17.198 --> 19:19.448
Lion Guard defend!

19:22.086 --> 19:25.171
Oh, don't worry, my dear.
It will all be over soon.

19:25.206 --> 19:29.375
After all, we are not uncivilized.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.043
Now!

19:31.095 --> 19:34.263
- Parliament, attack!
- Vultures!

19:34.298 --> 19:37.183
- Get away from her!
- Kion?

19:40.304 --> 19:42.471
<i>Zuka zama!</i>

19:42.523 --> 19:44.223
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

19:44.275 --> 19:47.359
Leave Fuli alone!

19:47.395 --> 19:50.062
<i>Twende kiboko!</i>

19:50.114 --> 19:51.230
Reconvene!

19:51.282 --> 19:52.481
Reconvene!

19:54.402 --> 19:56.152
Mzingo!

19:56.204 --> 19:58.454
When you and your vultures take
on one member of the Guard...

19:58.489 --> 20:01.290
You take on us all!

20:10.501 --> 20:12.134
You okay?

20:12.170 --> 20:14.420
Yeah. Thanks for saving me, guys.

20:14.472 --> 20:17.473
Even though I feel kind
of lame for needing it.

20:17.508 --> 20:20.426
You shouldn't.
We're always there for each other.

20:20.478 --> 20:22.428
We're a team!
Yeah.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.181
Even I've been in trouble
once or twice.

20:26.234 --> 20:28.100
Okay, lots of times.

20:28.102 --> 20:32.104
Well, I wasn't helping the team by
going off alone and getting worn out.

20:32.156 --> 20:34.573
Next time I really will wait
for the rest of you.

20:34.609 --> 20:39.278
Just try to move a little faster
so I won't have to wait so long.

20:41.415 --> 20:43.282
Bunga, what's wrong?

20:43.334 --> 20:45.451
I gotta go meet up with my uncles.

20:45.453 --> 20:48.254
<i>And I don't have any utamu.</i>

20:48.289 --> 20:51.457
- Aw, I'm sure they won't care.
- You think?

20:51.509 --> 20:54.426

- I, uh, I've got some bad news.

21:05.473 --> 21:09.308
<i>I know I usually bring the utamu
grubs for us to celebrate with.</i>

21:09.360 --> 21:11.527
But I couldn't get
them this time.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.482
But that's not why
we celebrate.

21:16.484 --> 21:19.368
Timon's right.
We celebrate because
