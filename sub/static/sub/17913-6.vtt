00:14.920 --> 00:17.320
Nothing says classy
like two-day-old pants.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.400
Help yourself to mine.
Third drawer down.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.000
Thanks, but I don't wear thongs.

00:22.040 --> 00:26.480
- No, I've really... I've got to go.
- Come on, stay. Five minutes.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.440
Hmm, well...

00:30.320 --> 00:34.640
[chuckles] No, I'm not doing that.
I've got, like, a million boxes to unpack.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.680
All I'm suggesting is that you have time
for a cup of tea.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.000
Come round later
when I've unpacked my kettle.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.760
And for the record, you usually take
longer than five minutes.

00:42.840 --> 00:43.960
Oh, yeah?

00:44.040 --> 00:46.360
To drink a cup of tea.
[chuckles] To drink tea...

00:46.440 --> 00:48.480
[giggles] To drink tea!

00:49.360 --> 00:50.800
Nothing else!

00:50.880 --> 00:51.880
[Abigail squeals]

01:00.720 --> 01:02.400
So, I was thinking...

01:02.480 --> 01:06.200
about how this is all
very challenging for you, isn't it?

01:06.280 --> 01:08.960
I mean, if you don't know
why a car's broken,

01:09.040 --> 01:11.040
how are you gonna go ahead
and fix said car?

01:11.120 --> 01:13.960
- But I've found the thing that's broken.
- Sounds encouraging.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.880
See, earlier on my flatmate, Angus,

01:15.960 --> 01:17.880
mentioned wanting to go out
to pick up girls,

01:17.960 --> 01:20.000
and I suddenly felt this sort of...

01:20.080 --> 01:23.280
kernel of dread at the prospect.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.920
And that's not me, you see,
I don't do kernels of dread.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.280
So you want me to help you go out
on the pull again?

01:29.360 --> 01:30.520
You make it sound petty.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.960
The point of this is to get me back
to normal, isn't it?

01:33.040 --> 01:35.040
Well, my normal happens to be
wanting to go out

01:35.120 --> 01:36.960
and sleep with a shit-ton
of attractive people.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.240
So that's... that's the finish line.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.360
Did you ever want anything else?

01:41.440 --> 01:44.600
I did ask Father Christmas
for a pump-action Super Soaker once.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.920
- Still waiting on that.
- You're avoiding the question.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.720
- I am allowed to do that.
- And I'm allowed to call you on it.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.320
Was sex always what you were after?

01:52.400 --> 01:55.080
Did you never want a relationship?

01:58.840 --> 02:00.520
It's water under the bridge now.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.600
It was really just your timing.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.080
- My timing was bad.
- [chuckles]

02:04.160 --> 02:06.560
- And your delivery. [Chuckles]
- Also true. Yeah.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.840
- Actually, it's all coming back to me now.
- Oh, good.

02:08.919 --> 02:13.920
It was sort of your behavior in general
that was really shitty.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.600
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.440
But hopefully some happy memories, too?

02:23.520 --> 02:24.840
Yeah, in a way.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.000
But mostly not, no.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.560
Still, like you say,
water under the bridge.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.280
Okay. Two more lattes, two more slices
of the Valentine's cheesecake.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.160
- Are they all for you?
- You need a new joke.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.000
It's still got a couple more weeks in it.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.240
How're the tips today?

02:43.320 --> 02:46.040
Are you feeling the financial love
of many strangers?

02:46.120 --> 02:48.600
Well, one guy did ask me out to dinner.

02:48.680 --> 02:52.080
I told him I was spoken for,
even though you didn't get me flowers.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.080
- Yet.
- Clock's ticking.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.720
Listen, if he'd like to take you
to this dance this evening,

02:56.800 --> 02:59.240
then, you know,
I'd be okay with stepping aside.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.200
- You'll love it, okay?
- Of course I will.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.640
- I really won't. [Sighs]
- What's the thing?

03:04.720 --> 03:08.360
We're going to a Valentine's Day ceilidh.
It's like line dancing but even worse.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.360
- [chuckles] And way more Scottish.
- I went to one, like, four years ago.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.240
Everyone knew what they were doing
except me.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.360
After about ten minutes,
you could literally see people

03:15.440 --> 03:18.920
arranging themselves so they wouldn't
have to partner up with me.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.400
What about you?
What are you doing for the big day, Cara?

03:21.480 --> 03:24.080
- Is it a big day?
- It's a whole day about love.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.960
None of the other emotions get
their own day.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.240
Well, Ben's away again, so, um...

03:28.320 --> 03:32.120
I'll be celebrating my love of pizza
and Call of Duty 3.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.040
Who said romance was dead?

03:34.120 --> 03:36.160
If it's that or a ceilidh,
then I envy you.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.680
No, you don't.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.480
- Do you wanna go out later?
- Celebrate in style?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.880
- Celebrate what?
- February the 14th?

03:55.960 --> 03:58.280
Ugh, is it Valentine's Day?

03:58.360 --> 03:59.360
That crept up on us.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.680
- No, let's definitely not go out. What?
- [chuckles]

04:02.760 --> 04:05.560
All the restaurants will be packed
with moon-faced idiots

04:05.640 --> 04:07.800
who feel obligated to buy overpriced roses

04:07.880 --> 04:11.280
while trying to hold hands while they eat,
which actually is just...

04:11.360 --> 04:12.720
- [chuckles]
- completely impractical.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.080
- Are you joking or not?
- Do I sound like I'm joking?

04:15.160 --> 04:17.040
You do know it's...
it's also my birthday?

04:17.959 --> 04:20.480
- Yeah.
- Yeah. But did you actually know that?

04:20.560 --> 04:21.760
I was checking if you're free.

04:21.839 --> 04:24.360
'Cause for a minute there,
it seemed like you didn't know.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.160
You ruined the whole thing
I had going on.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.280
- Okay.
- Happy birthday.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.080
Of course we're celebrating.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.200
[indistinct laughter and chatter]

04:37.320 --> 04:39.160
Mal is having a birthday today!

04:39.240 --> 04:41.680
I thought I'd have years
before I had to deal with a birthday

04:41.760 --> 04:44.920
- and just like that it's happened.
- His birthday's on Valentine's Day?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.840
I don't know if it kills two birds
with one stone or ups the pressure?

04:47.920 --> 04:49.720
We've only been going out a few months.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.200
People like you are to blame
for making this difficult.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.960
I totally agree.
Dylan is the problem here.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.720
It's all well and good being wishy-washy
and full of feelings,

04:56.800 --> 04:59.680
but at some point people have to convert
those feelings into money spent

04:59.760 --> 05:02.680
on actual stuff that tells a person
how you feel about them.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.400
What you need is a book token.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.680
Fine. How much should I spend?

05:06.760 --> 05:08.280
- Don't give him book tokens!
- [chuckles]

05:08.360 --> 05:10.240
Don't tease me about this!

05:10.720 --> 05:15.120
Okay. What is a gift that says, "So far...

05:15.200 --> 05:16.840
I'm quite enjoying
hanging out with you"?

05:16.920 --> 05:19.400
[sighs] Barkeep, skinny cap.
Let's go. [Taps table]

05:19.480 --> 05:21.040
- I'm cutting you off.
- What? Why?

05:21.120 --> 05:23.920
I've had, like, two little
cappuccin-chows. Cuppy-chan-chins.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.520
Evie needs some romantic advice.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.240
Reverse cowgirl. Done. Next?

05:27.320 --> 05:29.160
Take him dancing.
Everyone loves that.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.600
I'm gonna give you
a list of things guys like. Pen, please.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.480
Hey, I don't need sex advice.
I just need advice on... everything else.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.600
Okay, well, tell Mal he just missed out
on a very happy birthday.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.680
Dylan. What do I do?

05:42.760 --> 05:45.520
- You could write him a poem?
- I'd rather break up with him.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.600
- Luke?
- Jo.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.920
Fuck. Uh, hello. Hi.

06:01.400 --> 06:05.080
- Uh... what are you doing here?
- Uh, conference. I'm a doctor now.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.360
Oh, I'm still not a doctor. [Chuckles]
It's pretty much no change with me.

06:08.440 --> 06:12.320
- How long has it been? Like, five years?
- Longer.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.720
It could be... It could be longer.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.480
I'd say, "Do you wanna get a coffee?"
but you're already carrying one.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.800
[stutters] This one's nearly done,
actually. So...

06:24.240 --> 06:25.240
[slurping]

06:26.240 --> 06:27.760
Mmm-hmm.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.240
That was good. [Inhales sharply]
I could use another.

06:30.320 --> 06:33.000
Do you want to do this properly?
Like, get a drink?

06:33.080 --> 06:35.360
It's just, it's been so long.
Are you around this weekend?

06:35.440 --> 06:37.160
- Tonight?
- [chuckling] On Valentine's?

06:37.240 --> 06:39.600
- You know, if you're free.
- I'm surprised you are.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.760
- You were always Mr. Relationship.
- Well, today's your lucky day.

06:43.840 --> 06:44.960
Same number?

06:45.040 --> 06:48.480
No, honestly, Jo. I mean,
literally nothing about me has changed.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.640
Okay.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.120
[Evie] Nothing expensive.
Nothing that involves me singing.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.680
Nothing that involves his family.
Nothing that Luke would do.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.320
Nothing sexy or heartfelt
or way too thoughtful.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.880
I once wrote, "Be Mine"
on a girl's ceiling using glow stars.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.400
I was hiding under the bed.
That was the second bit of the surprise.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.600
In retrospect, I didn't know her
well enough to be doing that.

07:25.680 --> 07:26.880
It didn't end well.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.360
Cara, what have you got?

07:28.440 --> 07:30.840
How do you actually feel about this guy?

07:30.920 --> 07:34.000
- I'm not indifferent to him.
- That belongs on a greetings card.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.640
Well, I do want him
to feel happy and stuff.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.000
- Why don't you cook him something?
- I've eaten your pasta and I didn't die.

07:41.080 --> 07:44.520
It's not expensive or clever
or particularly thoughtful,

07:44.600 --> 07:46.200
or weird and frightening.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.920
It's just eating at our house
with a tiny bit of effort.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.640
I like it!

08:00.280 --> 08:02.240
So, do they cover this in your course?

08:02.320 --> 08:05.520
It's native to the Himalayas.
Grows as a weed in the wild there.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.680
- Weed grows as a weed?
- I know more about rhododendrons.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.120
[chuckles]

08:10.200 --> 08:12.200
Ugh, don't go.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.840
Just stay here,
do something you don't really enjoy

08:14.920 --> 08:16.160
in order to keep me company.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.840
No one's given me a landscaping job.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.920
Yeah, but they will
once you're qualified.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.600
No, look, obviously it's cool you've got
something you wanna work towards.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.160
Beats coasting aimlessly.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.240
Maybe weed's the problem for me.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.480
I don't smoke that much when Ben's around,
but, like...

08:31.560 --> 08:34.000
lately he's been gone
three weeks in the last month,

08:34.080 --> 08:37.360
and... I seem to have stopped
washing my clothes.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.559
Showering?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.360
Occasionally. [Chuckles]

08:41.520 --> 08:43.840
- Do you want some?
- No, not for me.

08:43.919 --> 08:46.600
I'm... I'm already paranoid enough
about tonight.

08:46.680 --> 08:48.840
- Too many steps to think about.
- [chuckles]

08:54.040 --> 08:55.440
[exhales]

08:55.520 --> 08:57.880
Do you want me to teach you the basics?

08:57.960 --> 09:02.120
I could come over and talk you through it
before you go.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.040
Really? That would be amazing.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.120
[Luke humming]

09:12.360 --> 09:14.200
Oh! You were in there hours!

09:14.280 --> 09:16.760
- You smell fruity.
- It's Valentine's Day, Dyl.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.360
I've got fresh-scented roses
to compete with.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.680
So who is she?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.320
- No one special.
- [Evie] Luke!

09:22.040 --> 09:23.840
- What have you done to the bathroom?
- I've showered?

09:23.920 --> 09:25.680
Yeah, I can see that.
I went to have a shower

09:25.760 --> 09:27.320
and there are tiny black hairs everywhere.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.480
- Uh-huh. Those would be my pubes.
- Oh, my God!

09:29.560 --> 09:31.800
- Why?
- Plenty of guys shave down there, Evie.

09:31.880 --> 09:35.120
That is so, so gross.
Okay, Mal is coming over

09:35.200 --> 09:37.040
- and the bath looks like it's got stubble.
- Good.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.720
So you're wearing aftershave
and you shaved your crotch.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.920
- Who is she?
- I don't want you guys to freak out,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.080
but I bumped into Jo
and there was a definite vibe.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.080
You're not trying to get back
with her, are you?

09:48.160 --> 09:49.720
- What's the big deal?
- You were a mess!

09:49.800 --> 09:53.680
- For about... Arguably still.
- [Dylan] Just don't get your hopes up.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.880
Just don't get hurt again.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.840
Guys, guys, guys... it's fine.
It's just ex sex.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.840
It's taking a stroll
in the old neighborhood.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.160
It's just booting up the Mega Drive
one last time,

10:03.240 --> 10:05.120
see if you're still good at Road Rash.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.040
Clean the bath!

10:10.120 --> 10:11.600
Clean it with fire!

10:14.120 --> 10:15.280
[doorbell ringing]

10:20.280 --> 10:22.080
You'll need this.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.080
Found it in a record shop
on Glaven Street.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.200
No doubt you'll wanna go back for more.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.280
[chuckles]

10:40.720 --> 10:43.000
I didn't get changed. Sorry.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.320
Oh, hey, what? This old thing?

10:45.400 --> 10:47.160
- It's practically my jammies.
- [both chuckle]

10:47.240 --> 10:49.120
No, you look great.

10:49.880 --> 10:50.960
So, how are you?

10:51.040 --> 10:53.120
What have you been up to
for the last five years?

10:53.200 --> 10:54.480
Yeah, good. Busy.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.480
You know, work mostly. You?

10:56.560 --> 10:58.120
Yeah, same. As always.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.600
And single on Valentine's Day.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.440
First time in three years.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.160
Well, here's to old times.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.880
To old times.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.800
Happy Valentine.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.280
Okay. Right.

11:13.360 --> 11:14.840
- Come stand in front of me.
- Mmm-hmm.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.560
Now, if you're not dancing with Emma,

11:16.640 --> 11:17.840
and you shouldn't stick with her
all night...

11:17.920 --> 11:19.200
- Yep.
- then the first thing you need to do

11:19.280 --> 11:20.480
is find a partner.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.640
Right, okay.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.320
- Don't ask people that are sitting down.
- Right.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.920
- Find someone who's milling about.
- Milling about.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.080
Good. Oh, okay...

11:30.840 --> 11:33.520
Um... [clears throat]
Excuse me. Would you like to dance?

11:33.600 --> 11:35.280
- No.
- No.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.080
- No.
- No.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.360
- No.
- No.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.960
Sometimes people say no. [Chuckles]

11:40.040 --> 11:41.400
- Okay, that's fine.
- Mmm-hmm. Yep.

11:41.480 --> 11:42.640
- Just move on quickly.
- Right.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.000
- You've only got a minute. Come on.
- Okay. All right.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.600
[inhales] Um, okay.
[clears throat and snaps fingers]

11:49.440 --> 11:51.240
Uh, would you like to dance?

11:51.320 --> 11:53.120
- I'd love to. Okay.
- [chuckles]

11:53.200 --> 11:56.040
Starting with a basic, Strip the Willow.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.240
Mmm-hmm.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.560
So, you take my hand.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.040
- I grip there and then...
- Mmm-hmm.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.880
...join hands in the middle.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.120
I'm... going to put the music on.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.320
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's what we need.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.960
- Mmm-hmm.
- [Cara laughs nervously]

12:16.400 --> 12:17.560
[Jo laughing]

12:18.720 --> 12:20.960
It's been really nice to see you again.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.800
Hey, we could get some food.
There's a great place round the corner.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.200
[chuckles] Nowhere's gonna have
a table tonight.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.320
Well, let's give it a try?

12:27.400 --> 12:28.600
Or...

12:29.880 --> 12:31.000
Or what?

12:31.080 --> 12:32.920
Do you have any food at your place?

12:37.960 --> 12:39.320
Wow.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.280
- [sighs] The lighting's not great.
- [lighter clicks]

12:43.000 --> 12:44.240
It's actually quite dark now.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.640
Do you want to see your food?
Not that it matters.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.000
Uh... I don't know.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.040
Lights back on?
No, keep them off, keep them off.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.520
It smells amazing.
What is it?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
- Oh, it's just... it's just pesto.
- Any nuts?

12:57.680 --> 13:00.440
Uh, no, no.
Just, uh, cheese and herbs,

13:00.520 --> 13:01.600
and some seeds and...

13:01.680 --> 13:04.000
[chuckles] I'm sorry
I couldn't afford a restaurant.

13:04.080 --> 13:07.800
Well, I... I could, but, you know,
if you'd ordered the steak and stuff

13:07.880 --> 13:10.120
I would have been like, "Shit."
That's not very romantic.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.360
So...

13:12.160 --> 13:13.920
Sorry, I don't really know
why I said that.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.520
Evie, this is perfect.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.360
[Scottish music playing]

13:39.720 --> 13:40.720
[laughing]

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
Now turn.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.440
Yeah!

13:53.800 --> 13:55.080
[laughing]

13:57.120 --> 13:58.720
- Oh, my God.
- [music stops]

13:58.800 --> 14:00.000
[chuckles]

14:00.080 --> 14:01.080
Very good.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.560
[both sigh]

14:03.640 --> 14:06.360
Now, they're gonna do waltzes.

14:06.440 --> 14:07.760
- It's Valentine's Day.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:07.840 --> 14:10.480
- Mmm.
- They'll probably do Rozsa.

14:10.560 --> 14:14.480
Do you wanna give that a crack
or have you got it covered?

14:14.560 --> 14:15.640
Let's do it.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.720
Okay.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.120
Are you ready?

14:21.200 --> 14:22.200
[slow music playing]

14:44.680 --> 14:47.200
Mmm. What's the crunchy stuff?

14:47.280 --> 14:48.440
Pine kernels.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.160
Did I not mention the nut allergy?

14:50.240 --> 14:52.200
No, they're not nuts, they're seeds.

14:52.280 --> 14:56.800
Okay, just to clarify,
I have a nut and pine kernel allergy.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.560
Are you all right with this?

15:06.640 --> 15:08.720
Oh, yeah. Very much so.
In a big way.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.480
It's just...

15:10.560 --> 15:12.760
this can only be a one-time thing, and...

15:12.840 --> 15:15.120
after the weekend I'm heading back and...

15:15.200 --> 15:18.600
I just don't want you to think
that I think this is gonna lead to...

15:18.680 --> 15:20.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, of course.

15:20.080 --> 15:23.000
Yeah. I know, it's just a...
It's just a one-night thing.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.000
Okay. That's the small print
out of the way.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.280
[both chuckle]

15:31.480 --> 15:33.640
[wheezing] Pen...

15:35.000 --> 15:36.200
- Pen.
- Pen.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.760
EpiPen! In my jacket!

15:44.640 --> 15:45.640
[whimpers]

15:49.040 --> 15:50.840
Don't go unconscious!

15:53.040 --> 15:54.280
Mal!

15:54.880 --> 15:56.320
[grunting]

15:57.040 --> 16:00.360
- [panting]
- [both grunt]

16:01.120 --> 16:02.320
[grunts and pants]

16:02.400 --> 16:04.320
Do I not stab it in your heart,
like in Pulp Fiction?

16:04.400 --> 16:05.440
[sighs]

16:08.360 --> 16:10.480
- Condom?
- Yeah, good point.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.800
- Let me.
- Ooh.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.520
[grunts]

16:30.200 --> 16:31.720
Don't worry. It's like a bus.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.320
- One comes along every few minutes.
- [both chuckle]

16:57.960 --> 16:59.040
Fuck!

16:59.800 --> 17:01.360
- Oh!
- Um...

17:06.359 --> 17:08.960
[stammers] This has literally
never happened to me before.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.920
- It's okay.
- No, no, honestly,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.480
I mean, like,
this is genuinely not one of my problems.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.440
I get, like... I get quite dry skin
during winter, um...

17:16.520 --> 17:17.760
I get fairly bad hay fever.

17:17.839 --> 17:20.480
One of my feet's bigger
than the other, but that is honestly it.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.040
I'm not... This doesn't...
You know I'm good for this, right?

17:23.119 --> 17:24.400
Of course I do.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.599
[chuckling]

17:27.960 --> 17:28.960
[grunts]

17:33.640 --> 17:35.200
I have to break up with Emma.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.840
On Valentine's Day?

17:39.880 --> 17:41.560
Great timing.

17:41.640 --> 17:45.040
[stammers] I'd honestly...
I hadn't thought about you in that way.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.360
Emma's a beautiful girl.
I could see how she'd be distracting.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.600
- Look, anyway I've got a boyfriend.
- But it doesn't sound like it's working.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.400
We don't get to spend enough time together
for me to know either way.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.440
- So?
- No.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.520
I don't know.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.560
I think I'm just lonely.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.720
[stammering] And I think
that it's just wrong without...

18:02.800 --> 18:04.840
I just... Don't.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.760
Because if you touch me,
I'm not gonna want you to stop,

18:08.840 --> 18:10.800
and that is not helpful to anyone.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.360
I'm gonna take off.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.920
But what if that's a mistake?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.720
Neither of us is sure, though.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.480
Are we?

18:25.120 --> 18:27.000
You're gonna be late for Emma.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.600
[door opens and closes]

18:32.280 --> 18:35.280
Of all the people for this to happen with
in the world, it had to be you?

18:35.360 --> 18:36.920
What does that mean?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.160
I wanted this to be great.

18:38.240 --> 18:42.040
- I wanted you to want to do it again.
- I've just broken up with someone.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.080
Ah, okay, so rebound territory.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.080
- Fair enough.
- I'm really sorry.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.200
I thought this was like
an old friends type of thing.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.960
Has there really not been anyone else?

18:54.320 --> 18:58.360
There was one girl, but...
she was going out with Dylan, so.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.000
Was, as in isn't anymore?

19:02.320 --> 19:03.960
I'm gonna go.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.440
I don't regret this, you know.

19:10.600 --> 19:15.920
I mean, I feel fucking terrible, but...
at least that's something, eh?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.200
You should call her.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.200
If Dylan's your friend,
he'll be happy for you.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.320
[door closes]

19:27.920 --> 19:30.200
- Worst birthday ever?
- [chuckles]

19:30.280 --> 19:32.480
Just so you know...

19:32.560 --> 19:35.120
- I am really bad at birthdays.
- [laughing]

19:35.200 --> 19:37.200
And I did forget.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.360
And I'm probably gonna suck
at Christmas, too.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.360
I just... [inhales sharply]

19:41.440 --> 19:43.200
Oh, I just wanted to get it right.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.120
I just wanted you to think
that I cared about you.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.400
Because you do care about me?

20:26.760 --> 20:28.440
Broke up with Emma at the dance.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.400
It was not well-received.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.080
[sighs]

20:32.160 --> 20:34.360
- Be my valentine, Dylan.
- [sighs]

20:34.440 --> 20:37.160
I'm not even asking, man.
I'm insisting.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.160
I just voluntarily cut my own heart out

20:43.240 --> 20:44.880
and drop-kicked it over a cliff.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.920
Don't you even think about moving.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.240
Don't worry. I won't.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.680
The day after you dumped me
on Valentine's Day...

20:58.760 --> 21:03.000
I think we actually broke up
in the early hours of February the 15th.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.440
- So technically, I didn't...
- Well, the very next day,

21:05.520 --> 21:07.080
you and Cara both resigned.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.400
I mean, come on.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.960
- Coincidence?
- Is that what this is about? Me and Cara?

21:11.040 --> 21:13.000
Yeah, you two were always
giggling away together.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.040
Does not take a genius.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.920
I was single for ages
after you and me broke up.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.520
[scoffs]

21:23.440 --> 21:27.160
Okay. You know what, I...
I did like her.

21:27.240 --> 21:30.440
I, um...
Took me a long time to realize it,

21:30.520 --> 21:33.240
but, um... I did.

21:33.320 --> 21:36.520
Uh, so I broke up with you
and I thought I was doing the right thing.

21:40.720 --> 21:43.480
- But you two never got together?
- No.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.800
Maybe that could've been something.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.000
Maybe I should've fought harder for her.
But I didn't.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.800
So... that's that.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.920
I heard she got married.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.480
I'm getting married as well.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.200
I'm very happy for you.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.840
How about you?

22:09.840 --> 22:13.320
Just trying to not make
the same mistakes twice.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.240
Three times.

22:15.320 --> 22:16.800
God knows how many times.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.560
Well, once was enough for me.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.760
[Cleo exhales]

22:32.080 --> 22:33.760
I'm sorry,
was I supposed to say something?

22:33.840 --> 22:35.960
Is it fair to say that your friendships

22:36.040 --> 22:39.200
make you feel safer
than your romantic relationships?

22:39.280 --> 22:41.400
Seems like
a rather crude analysis to me.

22:41.480 --> 22:46.960
If you refuse to let sex be about
love or friendship, what does that leave?

22:47.040 --> 22:49.960
Uh... all the good stuff?

22:50.040 --> 22:51.360
Anyway, I have love.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.920
I love my friends and they love me back.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.240
[opens bottle]

22:55.320 --> 22:58.400
Talk to me about Jo and Phoebe.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.680
Oh, God.
I can't believe I'm paying you for this.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.520
Everyone wants to be loved.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.720
Nobody wants to get hurt.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.920
But you don't get to have one
without the possibility of the other.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.200
Sorry, so is it my turn again?

23:19.600 --> 23:21.280
[beeping]

23:22.440 --> 23:23.440
[door buzzes]

23:38.560 --> 23:42.760
I, uh... I noticed your plates
struggling to drip dry,

23:42.840 --> 23:45.440
and I know everyone
likes a dry plate, so...

23:45.520 --> 23:46.960
Solving my kitchen problems.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.840
My prince!

23:53.320 --> 23:54.320
Oh.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.920
Sorry it's not as practical.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.960
What am I meant to do with this?
What's its function?

24:01.040 --> 24:06.600
It's a device for turning sunlight,
rain and soil into color.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.960
I've got something for you.

24:09.720 --> 24:12.240
I'm literally giving you...

24:13.360 --> 24:14.760
nothing.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.160
This whole empty space is yours.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.320
Would it ruin it if I sometimes left
some socks in there?
