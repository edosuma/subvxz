01:38.244 --> 01:40.093
Dad...

01:44.031 --> 01:46.580
Maybe it's the wind

01:55.704 --> 01:57.363
No!

02:00.242 --> 02:04.139
Stop! Please! Stop!

02:10.047 --> 02:14.090
You have a week, Evans. Then we'll burn the house.

02:16.609 --> 02:18.668
William

02:29.811 --> 02:31.780
William!

02:39.086 --> 02:41.665
God damn it, William!

02:43.594 --> 02:47.122
God damn it! Put that down!

02:47.632 --> 02:49.201
Let go!

02:53.000 --> 02:55.199
It's the last feed we've got

03:13.677 --> 03:15.986
I'll take care of this

03:19.655 --> 03:21.579
No, you won't

03:52.732 --> 03:57.730
Herd's over the ridge by now.
You go get cleaned up.

04:07.854 --> 04:10.343
You lied to me, Dan

04:12.551 --> 04:15.210
You told me we made payments to Hollander.
- We did

04:15.250 --> 04:23.455
So, how do you think we bought feed, Alice.
Three months water, the medicine for Mark...

04:24.195 --> 04:27.594
I had a choice between our family and paying them down

04:27.993 --> 04:30.417
We're supposed to make decisions together

04:30.787 --> 04:32.916
Would you have made anything different?

04:36.315 --> 04:43.201
Alice, we can't make it rain together
Turn the dust into grass

04:43.590 --> 04:47.328
We can't stop Hollander from selling
our land to the railroad either

04:50.536 --> 04:58.132
It's too bad the doctors at the aid station didn't take much of my leg.
I read that the pension act pays by the pound now

05:00.531 --> 05:03.030
Stop looking at me like that

05:03.070 --> 05:05.449
Are you going to tell the Marshal what those men did?

05:05.479 --> 05:08.457
Marshal ain't doing shit
-William.

05:08.477 --> 05:14.424
First thing, Mark. I'm going to take you boys.
We're going to round up the herd.
Then I'm going into town

05:14.464 --> 05:15.923
What are you going to do there?

05:15.953 --> 05:18.362
I'm going to tell Hollander to make this right

05:18.992 --> 05:23.089
I'm going to tell him to pay for a new barn.

05:23.898 --> 05:26.947
Maybe we should just shoot him like Will says.

05:54.607 --> 05:58.224
Coach is headed for Bigsby, Boss

05:58.794 --> 06:04.500
Girded with iron, (?) on top, double shotguns.
And a Gatling

06:52.071 --> 06:55.658
You should have let me save the feed

06:59.957 --> 07:01.886
Ar you going to hock that?

07:02.385 --> 07:04.374
Some day, William, ...

07:04.983 --> 07:08.042
... when you walk in my shoes you might understand.

07:08.092 --> 07:10.791
I ain't never walking in your shoes.

07:10.861 --> 07:12.649
Tracks over here.

08:26.765 --> 08:28.974
Here we go.

08:29.014 --> 08:31.503
Giddy up!!

09:39.571 --> 09:41.621
Go man the Gatling

09:58.340 --> 10:00.729
Mark, stay here

10:19.904 --> 10:21.503
Down !!

10:42.811 --> 10:45.490
I think they will not follow us anymore.
[They're not going to (?) in a (?)]

10:56.934 --> 10:59.503
Pull up! Pull up!

11:54.778 --> 11:57.567
Good morning, Pinkerton

11:58.616 --> 12:02.914
Name's Charlie Prince,
I expect you've heard of me.

12:05.412 --> 12:11.250
Well, I heard about a
balled up whore named Charlie Princess.

12:12.358 --> 12:14.557
Is that you, missy?

12:19.215 --> 12:21.783
I hate Pinkertons

12:21.833 --> 12:24.022
Byron McElroy

12:24.062 --> 12:27.551
When did your hair turn gray, Byron?

12:28.220 --> 12:30.884
Go to hell, Ben Wade.

12:34.203 --> 12:38.790
Well, will you look at all this.
You all spared no expense this time, Byron

12:39.669 --> 12:45.157
I've got to say, thought.
It's probably cheaper just to let me rob the damn thing

12:49.464 --> 12:53.952
If you are going to kill me,
just as soon get to it

12:55.670 --> 12:58.079
I ain't going to kill you

12:58.109 --> 13:00.198
Not like this

13:01.907 --> 13:04.936
It won't change a thing,
if you let me live

13:06.615 --> 13:09.314
I'll come for you.

13:09.924 --> 13:12.452
I'd be disappointed if you didn't

13:13.861 --> 13:15.520
She's lit
She's lit!

14:05.317 --> 14:07.106
Let's go.

14:24.637 --> 14:26.427
There we go

14:31.833 --> 14:38.599
I'm going to ask you to put down the money.
Step back. Tell them to step back or this man will die!

14:38.649 --> 14:41.078
Not a smart move, friend

14:50.269 --> 14:51.968
Shit

14:57.275 --> 14:59.344
He's fast

15:09.328 --> 15:16.414
Well, Tommy. It seems that there was
a Pinkerton inside that coach that wasn't quite dead

15:18.263 --> 15:25.500
Now, I know what Charlie told you,
because we don't got but a few rules in this outfit

15:25.550 --> 15:28.728
This is what happens when you put us all at risk

15:34.355 --> 15:41.081
Mark, look at me. Keep looking at me.
Back up quietly

15:43.480 --> 15:45.179
William, look at me.

16:06.813 --> 16:08.952
Good morning.

16:11.320 --> 16:15.218
Those are my cattle.
I want them back.

16:17.627 --> 16:21.554
Carefully rancher. That's Ben Wades
you're talking to

16:25.333 --> 16:27.771
I need them back.

16:28.251 --> 16:30.240
They are all that I've got

16:31.840 --> 16:36.547
I don't need your cattle,
but I will be needing them horses

16:37.546 --> 16:41.674
So you don't go doing nohing..., Foolish

17:03.428 --> 17:05.357
Take the horse.

17:13.132 --> 17:17.060
Find them on the road to Bigsby.
Boys!

17:30.922 --> 17:34.031
They're probably just running late, Mr. Butterfield

17:34.081 --> 17:39.848
Pinkertons don't run late.
That's why they're paid 18 dollars a day.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.079
Get me on my feet.

18:44.149 --> 18:47.857
-I think you're in pretty bad shape, Mr....
-Just get me on my damned feet.

18:59.141 --> 19:02.798
Mark, Williams, get me some of them boards

19:26.072 --> 19:27.940
Can I help you ?

19:28.750 --> 19:34.007
I think maybe a coach headed for here
got itself held up in a canyon about 10 miles back

19:34.047 --> 19:35.637
God damn it

19:36.076 --> 19:38.444
By Mr Ben Wade himself

19:38.484 --> 19:40.224
How did you know it was Wade?

19:40.254 --> 19:42.453
It's been him the last 21 times, Marshal

19:42.493 --> 19:45.011
I saw a Mexican sharpshooter and an Apache

19:45.050 --> 19:46.550
God Damn it

19:47.359 --> 19:49.788
-Did you see the hand of God ?
-What's that?

19:49.868 --> 19:53.067
-His pistol
-Why the hell didn't you do something?

19:53.887 --> 19:59.304
They had a lot of weapons, Mr..
And they were shooting bullets.

19:59.354 --> 20:01.313
Let's go, we're wasting time

20:13.726 --> 20:16.115
Where are you from anyway?

20:20.222 --> 20:25.140
Tom Conrad bought 1000 heads in Mexico,
hired us to drive them in

20:26.929 --> 20:29.353
Let's go
Com on, boys.

20:42.646 --> 20:46.073
Hmmm. Something is going on with the railroad man

21:37.621 --> 21:42.119
Madame, some whisky for my friends.

21:45.117 --> 21:48.366
Let's go , the bar is closed.

22:12.222 --> 22:15.780
Here's to the 4 that we lost in battle.

22:17.200 --> 22:23.486
And here's to the boss who had to say good-bye to
Tommy Darlen today

22:24.505 --> 22:26.554
And that's too bad.

22:26.594 --> 22:28.932
Proverbs 13:3

22:30.302 --> 22:37.538
"He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life.
He that opens his lips too wide, shall bring about his own destruction"

22:37.598 --> 22:39.367
Amen

22:39.407 --> 22:42.385
Tommy was weak
Tommy was stupid.

22:42.405 --> 22:44.430
Tommy is dead

22:46.928 --> 22:48.838
I'll drink to that

22:54.094 --> 22:56.463
Sutherland

22:57.303 --> 22:59.422
Jorgensen.

23:03.329 --> 23:04.688
Campos.

23:07.827 --> 23:09.846
Jackson.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.254
Kinter.

23:30.845 --> 23:34.943
Marshal is only half stupid.
He's going to be back soon

23:37.991 --> 23:42.449
They're going across the border.
I won't be far.

23:43.858 --> 23:46.156
I'll wait for you.

23:46.186 --> 23:48.495
Allright Charlie.

24:00.465 --> 24:04.022
I've seen you someplace before

24:05.321 --> 24:06.651
Have you?

24:10.728 --> 24:14.177
You ever worked for a blind irishman in Leadville?

24:16.535 --> 24:22.372
I was a singer.
The best time I ever had in my whole life

24:25.570 --> 24:27.450
What made you to quit?

24:28.849 --> 24:34.047
I got to coughing
Doctor said I should find a dry climate

24:38.594 --> 24:42.242
You know, I spent more money
in that joint that I could tell you

24:44.001 --> 24:49.188
Do you remember a girl?
Her name was Velvet.

24:51.297 --> 24:54.754
Nobody forgets Velvet

25:01.002 --> 25:03.855
You look kind of skinny.

25:08.873 --> 25:10.931
I feel skinny.

25:12.041 --> 25:13.560
It's allright.

25:16.039 --> 25:22.535
I don't mind skinny girls
As long as they've got green eyes to make up for it

25:25.044 --> 25:27.132
Have you got green eyes?

25:39.067 --> 25:43.155
That's right, they (?) to be green.

25:52.869 --> 25:57.397
Do you think they lied?
Do you think they stole our horses?

25:57.476 --> 26:00.905
-They dont need our shit horses.
-Watch your mouth.

26:13.642 --> 26:16.061
I'll take him into town on my own

26:16.141 --> 26:21.738
You boys go round up the herd.
Don't push them too hard, I can't afford any more dropping

26:21.778 --> 26:25.866
Mr, we're going to have to lift you up
to get you on top of that horse

26:26.486 --> 26:28.374
Here comes the cavalry.

26:33.052 --> 26:35.450
Do as I said

26:41.187 --> 26:43.246
Is he from the coach?

26:43.296 --> 26:45.265
The only one that made it

26:45.305 --> 26:48.494
-Mr. McElroy, can you hear me?
-It was Ben Wade

26:48.564 --> 26:50.403
Can you hear me?

26:51.512 --> 26:54.000
This man needs attention.

26:54.070 --> 26:56.599
Did you see which way they rode, Evans?

26:57.269 --> 26:59.398
It seemed like they were headed to Bigsby

27:48.986 --> 27:54.873
You know, there is a little town just south of the border

27:55.883 --> 27:58.681
Pretty little pueblo (?)
Down by the river

28:00.421 --> 28:04.348
Folks would pay good money to hear
a white woman sing

28:05.657 --> 28:11.724
Yeah, imagine me (shinning on?) down to Mexico with Ben Wade on my arm

28:13.763 --> 28:20.719
I'm not wanted in Mexico.
Jump out that back windows with me now

28:25.636 --> 28:27.940
You're crazy.

28:32.558 --> 28:34.497
-Are you the Dr?
-Yes

28:34.557 --> 28:37.785
-Coach got held up
-Get him on the table.

28:46.060 --> 28:47.630
What's his name?

28:47.670 --> 28:51.698
Byron McElroy, he's a bounty hunter
under contract with the Pinkertons

28:59.403 --> 29:02.442
You've lost a lot of blood, Mr McElroy

29:08.219 --> 29:11.527
-That bullet is still in there
-Get it out

29:21.472 --> 29:23.820
Allright.

29:23.870 --> 29:26.628
What I'm about to do
is going to hurt like a son of a bitch

29:26.668 --> 29:28.857
It ain't the first time I've been shot

29:29.437 --> 29:31.416
Hold him, please

29:34.265 --> 29:36.569
Don't touch me.

30:14.738 --> 30:22.024
- What the fuck kind of Doctor are you anyway?
- It's nice to have a conversation with a patient for a change

30:49.814 --> 30:53.052
What the hell are they looking for?

30:53.911 --> 30:55.681
Ben Wade

30:55.721 --> 30:58.309
He held up the payroll coach

30:59.919 --> 31:03.286
-I want to talk, Mr. Hollander.
-Ben Wade in Bigsby

31:03.326 --> 31:06.255
Shit, we're moving up

31:06.335 --> 31:08.024
Mr. Hollander.

31:08.064 --> 31:09.362
Tucker, I'm going to the saloon

31:09.672 --> 31:12.531
You've got no right to do what you've done
You hear me?

31:13.361 --> 31:14.630
It's my land

31:14.670 --> 31:19.008
Come next week it's not, Evans
You borrowed a good deal of money,
and I got a right to (recompense?)

31:19.048 --> 31:22.946
But you damn up my creek.
You shut off my water.
How do you expect me to pay off my debt if you...?

31:25.185 --> 31:33.341
Before water touches your land it resides and flows on mine.
And as such, I can do with it as I fucking please.
Go home and pack up.

31:36.188 --> 31:39.347
Here, if you just give me till spring

31:42.756 --> 31:45.483
I can turn the corner

31:47.362 --> 31:51.361
Sometimes a man has to big enough
to see how small he is

31:52.395 --> 31:57.913
Railroad is coming, Dan
Your land is worth more with you off it

32:35.262 --> 32:37.591
Hollander!

32:48.355 --> 32:53.862
You look a little bent, rancher.
You come to wake some snakes?

32:54.562 --> 32:57.160
Dan, would you like a drink?

32:57.210 --> 32:58.230
No thanks.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.493
You got your horses back, didn't you?
And your cattle?

33:03.533 --> 33:08.300
Yeah, I got my horses back,
but you killed two of my herd

33:08.340 --> 33:10.828
Hell, they died for a good cause.

33:14.037 --> 33:20.743
You know, them beasts of yours
They woulnd't even fetch 100 dollars.

33:22.952 --> 33:27.779
I'll tell you what. That should cover it

33:31.057 --> 33:33.446
How much do you get for a day's work?

33:33.486 --> 33:35.055
2 dollars, when I hire out

33:35.755 --> 33:37.704
There are 2 dollars for a half-day.

33:43.002 --> 33:45.560
You took up my boys' time too

33:50.208 --> 33:53.465
You're right, I did

34:01.081 --> 34:04.569
Anything else you want to get paid for, Dan?

34:07.118 --> 34:09.942
Give me 5 dollars extra.

34:11.601 --> 34:13.330
And what's that for?

34:13.370 --> 34:15.539
For making me nervous

34:16.949 --> 34:19.637
Hands up, Ben Wade.

34:21.196 --> 34:23.635
Boss!

34:26.681 --> 34:31.550
-Give me your hands, Mr. Wade
-Tucker take his gun
- Give me that

34:33.150 --> 34:35.248
Ben Wade

34:37.757 --> 34:40.245
Captured in Bigsby

34:40.895 --> 34:43.994
Be careful with that thing
My gun's got a curse on it

34:47.382 --> 34:49.271
Laugh while you can.

34:49.311 --> 34:54.047
Crawley, go get the wagon.
Make sure every weapons we've got is (shoot?) ready

34:54.068 --> 34:56.246
I'll meet you up front of the office.

34:56.286 --> 34:58.676
-Get him out of here.
-Sure thing

34:58.706 --> 35:01.774
I think we should shoot him right now

35:02.713 --> 35:05.202
Put a bullet right in his nogging

35:05.282 --> 35:09.779
If you do that, everybody in this
shit piss of a town will be dead by morning

35:15.927 --> 35:25.197
22 robberies,
over 400 thousand dollars in losses
More in delays

35:25.687 --> 35:32.523
The Southern Pacific will have Ben Wade
convicted in a Federal court. Hanged

35:32.553 --> 35:36.580
...in public, an example made

35:37.100 --> 35:40.189
And we will pay to make it happen

35:40.269 --> 35:42.698
You all notice he didn't mention of the lives I've taken

35:42.758 --> 35:44.706
I need three more men.

35:44.756 --> 35:47.235
-You can have Tucker.
-Good

35:47.275 --> 35:49.574
I'm coming, you only need one

35:49.613 --> 35:51.743
You're wounded, Mr. McElroy.

35:51.783 --> 35:54.901
I rode in here. Sure as hell I can ride out

35:54.991 --> 35:58.480
-He goes, Potter's coming
-What?!

35:59.849 --> 36:01.827
Doc can't shoot shit

36:01.847 --> 36:06.385
I was better shot of my regiment. I'll come

36:08.294 --> 36:10.692
For 200 dollars.

36:12.501 --> 36:15.130
You fight for the north or the south?

36:15.730 --> 36:17.248
North.

36:17.298 --> 36:22.356
We are southern in name,
but Chicago owned. Fine

36:22.436 --> 36:24.265
200 dollars.

36:24.295 --> 36:25.889
Let's go

36:37.053 --> 36:39.862
-Thank you
-Thank me when it's done

37:16.333 --> 37:19.241
This town is going to burn!

37:23.079 --> 37:25.328
Let's get him, boys!

37:34.858 --> 37:37.267
Get in the coach

37:49.010 --> 37:54.947
God Damn it.
Evans, Crawley, Tucker
you need to mount up now!

37:54.977 --> 37:58.505
Head for Evans' ranch
I'll mee you there with the coach

38:14.237 --> 38:16.626
How long does he have to be here?

38:16.666 --> 38:21.822
A day or so. Make sure his outfit takes the bait

38:51.022 --> 38:55.888
Hello there. Evans
Can you give me a hand with this?

39:04.224 --> 39:08.981
Whatever your wife is cooking in there, smells good, Evans

39:25.642 --> 39:27.541
Let's go.

39:29.950 --> 39:32.039
Good driving, Marshal

39:45.551 --> 39:48.650
Remind me not to play poker in this town

39:49.959 --> 39:53.383
Well, Marshal, give us a count

39:53.423 --> 39:56.292
1... 2... 3...

40:15.031 --> 40:19.588
Gonna check on my family when you come back, right?

40:19.638 --> 40:21.067
First thing

40:46.334 --> 40:48.523
Madam

40:50.502 --> 40:54.090
Byron, an unpleasant surprise

40:55.519 --> 40:58.448
What happens if they catch the wagon?

40:58.518 --> 41:06.599
Well, you saw where his man was. He's still got to go fish the outfit.
Marshal's got a fast rig, they should reach the fort before dawn.

41:06.639 --> 41:10.177
His gang can't do anything in front of the whole sixth cavarly

41:25.089 --> 41:27.677
Did you have something to do with that?

41:29.676 --> 41:32.245
I hope you are proud of yourself

41:35.363 --> 41:37.562
Just doing my job, Doc.

41:41.371 --> 41:43.059
Thanks, son

42:01.679 --> 42:04.198
We always wait to say grace

42:04.717 --> 42:07.076
We don't presume to teach other people manners

42:07.116 --> 42:09.910
Aren't we supposed to say grace for murderers too?

42:09.950 --> 42:13.079
-Grace is for everyone, dear
-Then why don't we say it?

42:13.119 --> 42:16.387
Mark, I'd like to hear it.

42:21.584 --> 42:25.680
God, our father, Lord and Savior
Thank you for your love and favor

42:25.740 --> 42:31.237
Please bless this drink and food we pray
And bless all who share with us today

42:31.297 --> 42:32.847
Amen.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.684
Amen.

42:36.794 --> 42:41.982
If my pa' wanted to, he could shoot you dead
He can shoot a jack rabbit at 50 yards

42:42.881 --> 42:47.009
Shooting an animal is a lot different
than shooting a man, son

42:47.069 --> 42:52.296
Not, it isn't
Not in my opinion.

42:53.775 --> 43:01.981
We can ask Byron here.
Now Byron, he's killed dozens of people.
Men and women and children. Miners, Apaches

43:02.690 --> 43:07.018
Not a soul I've taken that didn't deserve what they've got

43:08.087 --> 43:15.954
"Every way of a man is right in his own eyes", Byron,
"but the Lord ponders the heart"

43:17.858 --> 43:20.357
Proverbs 21

43:35.068 --> 43:36.897
Dan

43:42.264 --> 43:45.462
You eat more when you're nervous, Mr Butterfield?

43:46.472 --> 43:51.290
Why, thank you, Dan.
How pleasant and kind of you. Much appreciated it

43:51.780 --> 43:57.457
Could you cut that for me?
Could you cut that fat out, I don't particularly like the fat at all.

43:58.017 --> 43:59.795
Allright.

44:02.224 --> 44:05.812
And the (grissle?)
I don't like (grissle?)

44:12.498 --> 44:15.517
Do you mind if I ask you how you got
that hitch in your step, Dan?

44:15.567 --> 44:18.125
Don't tell him nothing, Mr Evans.

44:21.573 --> 44:24.262
Where were you stationed?

44:25.996 --> 44:30.094
7th company of sharpshooters, out of (?) Massachusetts

44:34.372 --> 44:38.670
My father was defending the US capital
in the District of Columbia

44:39.669 --> 44:43.397
Isn't that so? Well, Dan. Tell me the story of
how you lost your leg

44:44.176 --> 44:49.274
Did they shoot it off? Cut it off?
Did the Indians do it?

44:59.998 --> 45:02.687
I saw something over there in the grass.

45:11.102 --> 45:13.221
There ain't nothing

45:21.906 --> 45:27.123
What if they caught up with the coach already?
What if they already know it's Crawley inside?

45:29.992 --> 45:32.441
Have you ever been to San Francisco?

45:34.675 --> 45:38.503
If it's all right by you, Mr. Wade,
I rather we not talk

45:39.413 --> 45:41.970
So you've never been in San Francisco?

45:43.280 --> 45:44.369
No.

45:48.518 --> 45:52.645
I know a girl there.
She's the daughter of a sea captain

45:52.695 --> 45:55.673
She had the most beautiful green eyes

45:56.983 --> 45:59.820
The greenest eyes
I ever saw

46:05.428 --> 46:07.637
Like yours.

46:11.435 --> 46:15.304
When I stared deep into them
they'd just change color in front of me

46:15.334 --> 46:17.871
All the colors of the sea.

46:26.647 --> 46:28.954
What did you say your name was again?

46:29.554 --> 46:31.263
Alice.

46:44.082 --> 46:47.950
For God's sake, he's killed more men than the (drought?)

46:47.980 --> 46:49.779
He is not what I expected

46:50.179 --> 46:53.616
He is dangerous
Dangerous is what he is, Alice.

46:54.116 --> 46:56.885
I don't want you or the boys
talking to him

46:58.514 --> 47:03.831
You can change your mind, Dan
None will think less of you

47:05.190 --> 47:08.788
None can think less of me

47:10.027 --> 47:13.696
6 months from now, everything is going to be great

47:14.265 --> 47:16.334
Cows are going to be fat

47:16.784 --> 47:20.153
We might even see the steam
from the train coming over the ridge

47:21.482 --> 47:29.348
We will be allright, but we won't make it through
the next 6 days, if I don't do this

47:34.584 --> 47:38.073
Sorry, Dan. McElroy says 5 minutes

47:49.497 --> 47:52.490
Do you think it's too much for me?

47:53.890 --> 47:56.189
He's a killer, Daniel.

47:56.998 --> 48:02.295
Yet somehow I have the decency
to bring him to justice.

48:06.503 --> 48:09.331
What are you thinking?

48:10.400 --> 48:14.738
I am not out there alone
Have a little faith in me

48:15.638 --> 48:19.905
Ben Wade has a gang
And they're out there tonight, somewhere

48:19.935 --> 48:25.982
If I don't go, we have to pack up and leave
and God knows where w/o a prayer to (?)

48:26.052 --> 48:30.580
Now, I am tired, Alice
I'm tired of watching my boys go hungry

48:30.650 --> 48:34.847
... I'm tired of the way they look at me
I'm tired of the way that you don't

48:35.557 --> 48:43.762
I've been standing on one leg for 3 damned years,
waiting for God to do me a favor

48:46.161 --> 48:48.360
And he ain't listening

48:50.069 --> 48:51.498
Mr. Evans.

49:02.908 --> 49:07.305
No, no, no. This is my horse now

49:10.813 --> 49:12.702
Come over here

49:20.448 --> 49:23.936
-Don't give me any trouble, Mark
-Yes, sir

49:27.484 --> 49:29.183
Boy.

49:29.263 --> 49:31.522
-I want to come with you
-Well, you can't

49:31.542 --> 49:32.722
I can help.

49:32.762 --> 49:34.861
You're 14 years old.

49:34.891 --> 49:38.569
I can ride faster and
you shoot better than any one of them.

49:38.609 --> 49:44.055
The Pinkerton is hurt, Potter is no good,
that railroad man is dead weight, and that other bastard...

49:44.875 --> 49:48.174
I dont have time to argue
I need you here.

49:48.204 --> 49:50.072
That's that
That's that

49:56.479 --> 49:59.277
So, boys, where are we headed?

49:59.317 --> 50:08.897
It ain't none of your business where we are headed, Wade.
You're a prisoner. You don't speak, you don't piss.
You don't god damn breathe unless we say so.

50:09.347 --> 50:11.606
Do you understand that?

50:14.655 --> 50:20.951
We're taking you to Contention
Putting you on the 3:10 to Yuma, day after tomorrow

50:20.991 --> 50:22.880
You shouldn't have told him, now.

50:23.350 --> 50:28.697
Relax, friend. Now if we get separated
I'll know where to meet up

50:32.285 --> 50:38.151
I'd like tol thank you for your hospitality, Madame
I hope I can send your husband back allright

51:11.983 --> 51:16.616
What did Ben Wade mean about
sending Pa' back all right?
Is he saying he was going to kill him?

51:16.656 --> 51:21.144
Ben Wade don't have to lift a finger,
his gang will do it for him.

51:23.733 --> 51:26.741
Your father can take care of himself

52:11.857 --> 52:18.383
So, were you conscripted into Lincoln's army, Mr. Evans?
Or did you volunteered?

52:18.443 --> 52:20.522
Neither...

52:22.531 --> 52:23.995
Maybe both.

52:24.025 --> 52:25.814
What does that means?

52:26.324 --> 52:36.129
It means I was a volunteer for the Massachusetts State Guard
Then in 62 the Federal government was running low on men
so they called in the state militias

52:36.739 --> 52:41.066
-To protect Washinton.
-And that's when you got hurt

52:45.044 --> 52:50.640
What are you doing out here, Dan?
You've got a family to protect.

52:51.740 --> 52:55.638
You are not a law man,
you don't work for the railroad
like Mr. shinny shoes over there

52:55.688 --> 52:58.147
Not a Pinkerton

52:58.957 --> 53:03.455
Maybe I don't like the idea of
men like you running loose

53:03.665 --> 53:07.452
It's man's nature
to take what he wants, Dan

53:07.492 --> 53:09.321
It's how we are born

53:09.371 --> 53:13.389
Well, I make an honest living

53:13.469 --> 53:16.897
It might be honest, but I don't think it's much of a living

53:16.927 --> 53:20.105
you must be hurting bad for money
to take this job

53:21.804 --> 53:23.704
Go to sleep.

53:28.041 --> 53:31.339
I imagine debt puts
a lot of pressure on a marriage

53:31.409 --> 53:35.232
Are you married?
What would you know about marriage?

53:36.432 --> 53:39.571
We can't all be cutthroats and thieves

53:39.640 --> 53:44.137
Well, I know that if I was lucky enough to have a wife
like Alice, I'd treat her a whole lot better than you do, Dan

53:44.877 --> 53:50.544
I'd feed her better, I'd buy her pretty dresses.
I wouldn't make her work so hard.

53:53.142 --> 53:56.821
Yeah, I'd bet Alice was a real pretty girl before she married you...

53:56.851 --> 54:04.157
Don't talk about my wife. You shut up about her.
You say one more word and I cut your tongue.

54:06.865 --> 54:09.634
I'd like the sight of it if you did.

54:09.674 --> 54:11.463
Mr. Evans.

54:18.309 --> 54:21.008
It's my watch, now

54:54.594 --> 54:59.811
#Gonna hang me in the morning
#For the night is done

55:02.570 --> 55:07.776
#Gonna hang me in the morning
#I'll never see the sun

55:07.256 --> 55:11.165
I suppose it's too much to ask for a little quiet.

55:12.364 --> 55:18.531
The way I figured it: I'd be asleep in my
own bed right now if it weren't for you

55:19.211 --> 55:23.808
So if I've got to be up,
you damn well be up with me too,

55:23.848 --> 55:26.607
Ben Wade.

55:58.954 --> 56:01.183
Son of a bitch!

56:16.924 --> 56:18.853
Enough.

56:22.432 --> 56:25.521
-Enough!
-That's enough, McElroy

56:38.374 --> 56:40.573
We have to bury him.

56:41.451 --> 56:47.279
If you take the time to dig one grave
you might as well dig one for yourself

56:50.356 --> 56:53.125
Let's go.
Mount up

56:54.095 --> 56:59.337
#Gonna hang me in the morning

57:04.715 --> 57:07.843
#I'll never see the sun
[Laughs]

58:21.659 --> 58:25.356
Don't worry there, Boss
We're going to get you out of there in a second

58:40.397 --> 58:42.726
Wait!
Wait!

58:44.196 --> 58:46.695
Sutherland.

58:50.902 --> 58:52.701
Jackson

59:01.746 --> 59:02.995
No, No.
Don't do this

59:03.815 --> 59:07.912
Don't do this.
Don't do this.

59:08.182 --> 59:09.172
Where is he?

59:09.521 --> 59:12.390
Open the door. Open the door!
Let me out of here, God damn it!

59:12.680 --> 59:13.580
Where did they take him?

59:13.989 --> 59:15.104
I don't know!

59:20.452 --> 59:23.539
Mr., you'd better tell me where they took him...

59:24.919 --> 59:26.348
...or you will burn

59:33.124 --> 59:34.023
Contention!
Allright?!

59:34.823 --> 59:36.123
They're going to Contention

59:36.722 --> 59:40.310
They're going to put him on the
3:10 to Yuma prison. Tomorrow

59:44.528 --> 59:45.627
Let me go out of here!

59:49.236 --> 59:54.154
Contention is... 80 miles
back to the other way.

59:55.043 --> 59:56.442
They've just about killed our horses

59:56.852 --> 59:58.441
So, we'll buy new ones.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.168
Charlie, it's his own fault he got caught
He made a mistake.

01:00:06.046 --> 01:00:08.415
You think you can do a better job
leading this group?

01:00:09.185 --> 01:00:09.984
Maybe...

01:00:15.921 --> 01:00:19.179
You've forgotten what he
done for us?

01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:27.011
We're going to Contention!

01:00:39.434 --> 01:00:41.522
Can't say I didn't warn you

01:00:45.171 --> 01:00:46.650
There's a shortcut we can take

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.429
A shortcut?

01:00:49.178 --> 01:00:50.158
Through the pass

01:00:50.737 --> 01:00:52.027
It takes you right through Contention

01:00:52.437 --> 01:00:53.456
Why didnt you say something before?

01:00:53.936 --> 01:00:55.425
It's Apache country

01:00:56.135 --> 01:00:59.783
-I thought that the government gave them land.
-These are the ones who refused to go.

01:01:00.263 --> 01:01:02.652
-I wouldn't take that path
-You want us to take the long way?

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.081
-That's right
-and let your boys catch us?

01:01:07.599 --> 01:01:11.937
Mr.. Butterfield, the Apache who lived
in that path are the ones that stayed to fight

01:01:13.096 --> 01:01:14.495
They enjoy killing

01:01:15.694 --> 01:01:16.784
You ain't going to make it

01:01:20.692 --> 01:01:22.391
We'll take our chances

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.540
Something on your mind, Dan?

01:01:54.679 --> 01:01:55.768
Why did you kill Tucker?

01:01:57.177 --> 01:01:59.466
Why not me? Or Butterfield?

01:02:00.385 --> 01:02:01.945
Hell, Tucker took my horse.

01:02:04.094 --> 01:02:06.183
Did you liked him, Dan?
-No

01:02:08.132 --> 01:02:10.091
He told me he burned down your barn

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.289
He was an asshole

01:02:15.338 --> 01:02:17.806
But wishing him dead and
killing him are two different things

01:02:18.896 --> 01:02:20.805
Your conscience is sensitive, Dan

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:23.243
I don't think it's my
favorite part of you.

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:29.300
(?), Mr. Wade. If you want to
talk to somebody, talk to me.

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:31.908
I don't like talking to you, Byron

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:34.007
Not when I have the gun.

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:37.546
No, that ain't it.
I just don't find you that interesting.

01:02:38.825 --> 01:02:41.329
Laugh it up, Doc. 'till he
guts you like a fish

01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:43.638
Byron is like a song with one note

01:02:44.438 --> 01:02:46.776
Did you ever read another book in your
life, Byron. Besides the Bible?

01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:48.175
No need

01:02:52.382 --> 01:02:55.141
Byron acts pius. A few years ago when
he was under contract with Central,

01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:58.288
I've seen him and a bunch of brother Pinks ...

01:02:59.048 --> 01:03:01.077
... mow down 32 Apache women and children

01:03:02.247 --> 01:03:05.405
Renegades. Gunning down railroad men and their families ...

01:03:05.754 --> 01:03:08.013
... picking them off the road, one by one. Scalped.

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:12.531
There was young'nes running around.
Crying and screaming
No more than 3 years old

01:03:13.231 --> 01:03:16.999
... and his boys shot them all
and pushed them into a ditch

01:03:17.339 --> 01:03:18.898
Some of them were still crying

01:03:21.517 --> 01:03:25.204
I guess Byron figured that Jesus
wouldn't mind

01:03:27.214 --> 01:03:29.343
Apparently Jesus don't like the Apache

01:03:30.912 --> 01:03:32.010
Keep on talking...

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:40.136
All the way to Yuma. Right up on them steps
to the rope. Straight to hell

01:03:41.015 --> 01:03:42.315
Yeah, the day I die, Byron

01:03:43.254 --> 01:03:44.804
I'm getting sprung from hell

01:03:45.563 --> 01:03:52.345
I might feel the same, if I'd come from the seed of a
drunk grave digger and the rancid womb of a whore

01:04:06.597 --> 01:04:07.287
Drop it, Dan Evans.
Drop it

01:04:08.096 --> 01:04:09.176
Toss it to the ground, Doc

01:04:10.635 --> 01:04:11.925
Mr. Butterfield...

01:04:15.692 --> 01:04:21.999
I believe, Dan, you're carrying a pistol as well.
I'd appreciate it if you take it out
and drop it on the ground. Thank you

01:04:28.636 --> 01:04:33.853
Now, I've always liked you, Byron, ...

01:04:32.713 --> 01:04:34.343
..., but you never knew when to shut up

01:04:38.621 --> 01:04:40.809
Even bad men love their mommas

01:04:46.256 --> 01:04:48.225
Now I think it's time
for everybody to go home

01:04:49.464 --> 01:04:50.723
Don't you move, Mr. Wade.

01:04:51.733 --> 01:04:52.932
Let go of that shotgun.

01:04:55.031 --> 01:04:57.445
William, what the hell are you doing here?

01:04:59.065 --> 01:05:02.623
I don't think that you're going to shoot a man (?)
in the back of the head, boy

01:05:03.802 --> 01:05:06.480
Dan, tell your boy it's over

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.189
You think you can keep you gun on him, William?

01:05:11.298 --> 01:05:14.326
I'm doing a damn sight better than you did

01:06:00.561 --> 01:06:02.360
You ever been to Dodge City?

01:06:06.294 --> 01:06:07.283
No.

01:06:09.022 --> 01:06:10.222
Stop talking to him

01:06:15.558 --> 01:06:18.027
The way you're shuffling those cards,
I took you for a pro

01:06:19.437 --> 01:06:20.626
I practice a lot.

01:06:21.266 --> 01:06:22.026
I can tell

01:06:30.331 --> 01:06:31.329
You ever been to Dodge?

01:06:31.839 --> 01:06:32.829
Yes, indeed

01:06:34.268 --> 01:06:36.937
Meanest, most beautiful, dirty city there ever was

01:06:37.447 --> 01:06:43.084
Saloons just overflowing with cattle drivers and road agents,
prospectors, gunslingers, gamblers and women

01:06:46.553 --> 01:06:48.491
Women will do things to you you'll never forget.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.649
They'll give you disease you'll never forget

01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:56.457
Money in your pocket in Dodge City
you can have everything a man ever wished for

01:06:59.295 --> 01:07:00.594
Everything a man comes to need

01:07:04.503 --> 01:07:06.791
I got (?) I was a boy not much bigger than you

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.839
Now, how many men have you killed since then, Wade?

01:07:14.032 --> 01:07:15.522
How many families have you destroyed?

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:22.478
Quite a few

01:07:25.976 --> 01:07:31.073
Is it true that you dynamited a wagon
full of prospectors in the Western Territories last spring?

01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:32.782
No, that's a lie.

01:07:33.982 --> 01:07:35.291
It was a train full

01:07:44.726 --> 01:07:45.785
(?), Dan

01:07:49.194 --> 01:07:50.423
I gotta take a piss

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:55.461
You know, I thought he was going to
shoot me back in the ravine

01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:58.828
I really thought he was going to do it

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.778
There was a wildness in his eyes.
He reminds me ...

01:08:01.217 --> 01:08:02.587
He's going to be nothing like you, Wade

01:08:08.753 --> 01:08:11.312
A man's got to have a head start
on the path of decency

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.848
Yeah, that's why I don't mess around
with doing anything good, Dan.

01:08:22.161 --> 01:08:23.680
Dou do one good deed for somebody...

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:26.779
I imagine it's habit forming

01:08:28.698 --> 01:08:32.444
Something decent. See that grateful
look in their eyes....

01:08:33.095 --> 01:08:35.064
... I imagine it makes feel like christ hisself

01:08:35.464 --> 01:08:37.863
I've had enough of this, Wade.
Come on. Let's go

01:09:33.037 --> 01:09:35.227
It's three of them
-Yours?

01:09:35.727 --> 01:09:37.037
If they were mine, you'd be dead

01:09:40.533 --> 01:09:41.514
Give me that gun, Wade!

01:10:32.496 --> 01:10:33.625
I told you not to come this way

01:10:34.815 --> 01:10:36.244
It was McElroy's decision.

01:10:36.744 --> 01:10:37.914
I told you there'd be trouble

01:10:43.736 --> 01:10:44.945
Give me the keys to the handcuffs

01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:13.169
Easy. Easy now

01:11:14.588 --> 01:11:15.518
Where is he?

01:11:16.377 --> 01:11:17.207
He's gone

01:11:20.126 --> 01:11:23.483
He took the horses with him.
I found this in the grass

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:35.187
That's the quickest way out of the pass
He'll be looking for help, to get his cuffs off

01:11:36.946 --> 01:11:38.216
We are going after him.

01:11:39.524 --> 01:11:42.513
There ain't no reward for getting him
halfway to that train, is there?

01:12:56.764 --> 01:12:59.962
I've got to be honest with you,
I like some of their food.

01:13:00.572 --> 01:13:03.271
As for wanting $40 a month now,
I can...

01:13:04.809 --> 01:13:05.769
Hello, Love.

01:13:07.018 --> 01:13:10.936
God damned Coolies. They'll work just fine
with my left boot up their ass

01:13:11.246 --> 01:13:13.504
Well, if I could teach a monkey
to lay track, ...

01:13:14.844 --> 01:13:17.542
Well. What we need here are some negros
brought here, Mister Boles

01:13:18.052 --> 01:13:19.811
Show these Chinamen what real work is

01:13:28.526 --> 01:13:30.026
Holly Christ!

01:13:31.725 --> 01:13:32.825
Who is that?

01:13:33.824 --> 01:13:34.924
That's him!

01:13:37.932 --> 01:13:40.170
-Help me with the handcuffs

01:13:43.139 --> 01:13:44.968
Break the chain.
Use the hammer.
Break the chain.

01:13:49.335 --> 01:13:52.164
I have 5 guns on you out here, Ben Wade

01:13:52.744 --> 01:13:53.833
Just come on out!

01:14:13.507 --> 01:14:14.347
The horses.

01:14:37.525 --> 01:14:38.634
What the hell is going on here?

01:14:41.943 --> 01:14:44.941
Mr. Butterfield, all finished in Bigsby?

01:14:45.451 --> 01:14:46.241
Mr. Boles

01:14:54.576 --> 01:14:57.874
You'd better hurry. We're making the last blasts
through the mountains this week.

01:14:58.482 --> 01:14:59.352
That's my prisoner.

01:14:59.872 --> 01:15:02.690
We're taking him to Contention,
putting him on the prison train to Yuma.

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.348
What prisoner?

01:15:06.358 --> 01:15:09.686
Come now, Mr. Boles. That's
Ben Wade you have there

01:15:10.386 --> 01:15:14.129
Ben Wade gunned down my kid brother, ...

01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:16.338
... in front of me, 6 years ago in Abeline

01:15:17.058 --> 01:15:19.107
Your brother was a lying (?) card shark

01:15:22.854 --> 01:15:28.732
That is, if he is the asshole I remember.
He could of course be some other asshole I've killed
that I've forgot about

01:15:43.573 --> 01:15:45.942
You can't do that. That's immoral.

01:15:48.541 --> 01:15:50.270
Immoral ain't got a damned thing to do with it

01:15:55.538 --> 01:15:58.346
I was expecting to collect a $200 reward for that man.

01:16:00.865 --> 01:16:04.272
I'm delivering him to Contention,
I need that money.

01:16:05.142 --> 01:16:07.770
Need it bad enough to die?

01:16:17.125 --> 01:16:20.104
At least let us take our horses.

01:16:21.004 --> 01:16:22.508
I've got no problem with that

01:16:23.248 --> 01:16:25.007
As long as you ride away, Mr.

01:16:26.606 --> 01:16:28.945
Nice knowing you, Dan

01:17:49.556 --> 01:17:50.526
God damn it!

01:18:05.478 --> 01:18:09.796
Did we make it?
Did we get away?

01:18:10.016 --> 01:18:12.784
Yeah, Doc. We did

01:18:14.783 --> 01:18:16.192
Thanks to you.

01:18:40.634 --> 01:18:45.622
We need a place to lay low. Keep him
out of sight 'till the train comes

01:18:46.761 --> 01:18:50.829
There is a hotel up here, I'll check to see,
and you ride around back

01:19:01.043 --> 01:19:05.249
Hey, Will. You keep a watch on the rail head
You see them coming...

01:19:05.349 --> 01:19:06.739
I'll let you know

01:19:08.038 --> 01:19:09.068
William!

01:19:27.558 --> 01:19:29.636
There's a Can-Can on the outs, if you're interested...

01:19:47.902 --> 01:19:51.231
It's the Bridal Suite,
I hope you don't mind, it's all they had

01:20:08.231 --> 01:20:11.480
Well, well. That looks like rain clouds over Bigsby

01:20:12.568 --> 01:20:15.087
You still need that $200, Dan?

01:20:15.097 --> 01:20:16.467
Shut up

01:20:18.706 --> 01:20:22.174
Mr.. Evans, you continue to give
me great confidence

01:20:25.393 --> 01:20:27.822
I'm going to see about the Marshal.

01:20:45.312 --> 01:20:50.958
We're looking for a group escorting
and outlaw by the name of Ben Wade

01:20:51.308 --> 01:20:53.407
Yeah, we've been chasing them
through these tunnels

01:20:59.639 --> 01:21:00.559
Who you are?

01:21:01.169 --> 01:21:02.228
What's it to you?

01:21:03.438 --> 01:21:05.176
Ben Wade killed my brother.

01:21:05.946 --> 01:21:08.045
Then your brother must be famous

01:21:11.913 --> 01:21:15.710
Are you, boys, some kind of posse?

01:21:26.994 --> 01:21:28.693
I hate posses

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:38.698
So this is the Bridal Suite.

01:21:40.097 --> 01:21:44.036
Now, I wonder how many brides
have taken in this view

01:21:48.043 --> 01:21:49.802
What are you going to do with your $200 now, Dan?

01:21:50.302 --> 01:21:51.901
Now that the rains are coming

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:56.818
I owe people money, Wade.
That drought left me in the hole

01:22:00.216 --> 01:22:02.116
What do you think about double that amount?

01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:07.478
You can pay your debts,
buy a hundred more cows

01:22:08.488 --> 01:22:09.677
Build a new barn

01:22:10.217 --> 01:22:11.716
How do you reckon I'm going to do that?

01:22:14.514 --> 01:22:17.912
Just lay down your gun
and let me walk out the door.
It's worth $400 (?)

01:22:20.221 --> 01:22:21.760
Is that what you reckon my price is?

01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:24.279
No...

01:22:26.788 --> 01:22:31.125
No, I reckon it's a thousand
One thousand dollars

01:22:31.284 --> 01:22:33.893
There was ten times that amount
in Butterfield's coach

01:22:35.003 --> 01:22:38.002
Do you want my cut, Dan?
It's all yours.

01:22:39.411 --> 01:22:41.710
Isn't that kind of reckless of you Wade?

01:22:42.799 --> 01:22:46.337
Seeing that... Hmmm. You're so sure that
your crew is coming to get you

01:22:48.356 --> 01:22:49.505
Oh, they're coming, Dan

01:22:51.445 --> 01:22:53.604
Sure as God's vengeance, they're coming

01:22:56.821 --> 01:22:58.650
But I just like to do things easy

01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:03.307
Imagine what you can do with $1000, Dan?

01:23:04.537 --> 01:23:07.715
You can hire a couple of ranch hands.
Your boys could go to school, grow up smart.

01:23:08.725 --> 01:23:10.354
What about Alice?

01:23:11.584 --> 01:23:14.877
She wouuld be the proud wife
of a bonafide Arizona rancher

01:23:18.086 --> 01:23:19.875
All you've got to do is say yes

01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:33.827
Will you give me a bank note, Wade?
Or will you be kind enough to make a deposit for me?

01:23:34.436 --> 01:23:35.426
Cash.

01:23:40.643 --> 01:23:45.700
You tell me, Wade. How will I
account for that amount of money?

01:23:47.819 --> 01:23:51.038
What will I tell people when I spend it?

01:23:51.428 --> 01:23:57.424
That you got the jump on me, you escaped,
and somehow I got a fortune

01:24:01.552 --> 01:24:02.972
No. How dumb do you think people are?

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.420
Nobody needs to know

01:24:09.768 --> 01:24:10.757
Do you know what?

01:24:11.357 --> 01:24:12.196
Would you do me a favor?

01:24:13.855 --> 01:24:15.464
Don't talk to me for a while.

01:24:16.704 --> 01:24:18.513
You mean
we're still not friends?

01:24:19.272 --> 01:24:23.495
No. No, we're not

01:24:25.305 --> 01:24:29.712
Come 5 minutes to 3, we're going to be
a hell of a lot closer than you think

01:24:37.517 --> 01:24:41.605
#They're gonna hang me in the morning

01:24:43.734 --> 01:24:46.342
#For the night is done

01:24:47.732 --> 01:24:52.140
#They're gonna hang me in the morning

01:24:54.319 --> 01:24:56.818
#I'll never see the sun

01:25:12.469 --> 01:25:13.058
Who is it?

01:25:13.578 --> 01:25:14.768
It's me, Dan

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:16.557
I brought help

01:25:17.576 --> 01:25:20.514
You've been gone for a long time, Mr. Butterfield

01:25:20.884 --> 01:25:24.302
How do I know someone ain't got
a gun on you out there?

01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:41.709
Dan, this is Marshal Will Doane

01:25:42.618 --> 01:25:45.007
Marshal
-Mr. Evans

01:25:47.145 --> 01:25:49.144
Two of my finest men

01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:58.259
I'm sorry about all that, Marshal,
I am grateful for the help

01:25:58.549 --> 01:25:59.619
Don't mention it

01:26:00.128 --> 01:26:03.017
So, you fellows are really going
to help to put me on this train?

01:26:04.037 --> 01:26:06.126
It might not seem like it, Mr.. Wade,

01:26:07.085 --> 01:26:09.474
but we got law and order in this town,
just like in any other

01:26:09.784 --> 01:26:12.692
Well, that's very reassuring, Marshal

01:26:13.112 --> 01:26:14.911
How much money is Butterfield paying you?

01:26:15.471 --> 01:26:17.700
That's not of your business

01:26:18.369 --> 01:26:19.289
You're coming with us?

01:26:19.969 --> 01:26:21.207
I'll be walking with you

01:26:22.416 --> 01:26:23.716
Every step of the way.

01:26:25.465 --> 01:26:26.585
You have my word on that, Dan

01:26:27.384 --> 01:26:30.832
That makes five of us. Five is good

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:39.663
It ain't enough

01:26:35.999 --> 01:26:37.504
It ain't nearly enough

01:27:01.161 --> 01:27:02.031
Pa!

01:27:02.431 --> 01:27:03.329
That's my boy

01:27:06.168 --> 01:27:06.958
They're coming.

01:27:09.706 --> 01:27:11.106
They are coming this way I've seen them
-Where?

01:27:11.206 --> 01:27:13.314
About a mile out, same way we come

01:27:13.684 --> 01:27:15.483
how many are they?
-Seven, ... Eight.

01:27:15.883 --> 01:27:18.322
Which is it? 7 or 8?

01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:22.289
Seven.

01:27:33.513 --> 01:27:38.210
Folks, sorry to bother you, but I'm going
to need you to move outside as quickly as possible

01:27:39.109 --> 01:27:42.818
That's it, folks.
Move along

01:27:52.668 --> 01:27:53.498
Right there.

01:28:12.306 --> 01:28:16.445
Sure there're a lot of them
- You'd figure, with it being the whole gang

01:28:42.241 --> 01:28:44.330
Boss?
Boss?

01:28:47.248 --> 01:28:48.237
Boss, are you are in there?

01:28:49.677 --> 01:28:51.046
What do you want me to tell them?

01:28:52.945 --> 01:28:55.379
You tell them you'll write
them a letter every day from Yuma

01:29:04.484 --> 01:29:05.674
Be careful, Wade.

01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:13.179
Charlie,
Boys.

01:29:15.488 --> 01:29:18.577
Charlie, why don't you take the boys
down to the saloon and boy them a drink

01:29:20.785 --> 01:29:21.984
Are you ok?

01:29:23.194 --> 01:29:26.223
I am fine. Just sitting up here with
my 4 new friends

01:29:29.041 --> 01:29:30.201
That's enough

01:29:35.408 --> 01:29:36.598
Thank You, Charlie.

01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:58.645
Listen up!

01:29:59.365 --> 01:30:00.514
Listen up!!

01:30:02.548 --> 01:30:04.457
That's Ben Wade they have up there!

01:30:05.947 --> 01:30:08.136
Ben Wade!

01:30:13.093 --> 01:30:16.781
Now, the railroad intends...

01:30:19.699 --> 01:30:24.427
... to put him on the 3:10 to Yuma and hang him

01:30:25.526 --> 01:30:26.696
What's he doing?

01:30:33.132 --> 01:30:37.140
We will give you $300 cash

01:30:38.519 --> 01:30:41.958
To any man who shoots
anyone of his captors

01:30:43.427 --> 01:30:47.114
$200 cash guaranteed!

01:30:53.522 --> 01:30:56.429
$200 guaranteed!

01:31:02.626 --> 01:31:03.815
I'll take $200
Give me the money

01:31:04.165 --> 01:31:05.954
You've got to shoot them first

01:31:12.696 --> 01:31:15.095
It's gotta be 30 or 40 with guns out there now

01:31:16.933 --> 01:31:18.023
The hell with this!

01:31:19.492 --> 01:31:21.570
Now, just a minute, Marshal

01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:29.216
Now, look. If it's a fair fight, sure.
I'd stay for that. A fair fight ...

01:31:29.815 --> 01:31:31.894
That's a man's duty, but...

01:31:32.804 --> 01:31:34.893
There's only 5 of us

01:31:35.663 --> 01:31:39.500
I'm sorry, Mr, but I'm not going to die here today

01:31:43.208 --> 01:31:44.568
And neither are my men

01:31:44.578 --> 01:31:45.627
Marshal, ...

01:31:48.926 --> 01:31:51.325
You forgot this

01:31:55.912 --> 01:31:56.801
Marshal?

01:32:03.327 --> 01:32:07.046
Now, you see, Dan. Generally, ...

01:32:07.116 --> 01:32:08.305
... pretty much everyone ...

01:32:09.015 --> 01:32:09.975
.... wants to live

01:32:10.354 --> 01:32:11.653
I'll double your money

01:32:11.853 --> 01:32:12.872
Let's go, boys

01:32:13.452 --> 01:32:16.141
Please, do you want to see
us shot down in the street?

01:32:16.561 --> 01:32:17.740
This thing happened in Bigsby

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.504
That means Butterfield too

01:32:19.884 --> 01:32:21.283
Why bring your troubles to Contention?

01:32:21.483 --> 01:32:24.282
We've got families
Everyone of us is a family man

01:32:24.582 --> 01:32:25.771
I'm a family man too

01:32:26.781 --> 01:32:29.229
He's gona walk out on you

01:32:30.189 --> 01:32:33.217
Then you'd best get out
like the rest of us

01:32:37.124 --> 01:32:41.183
He's (not?) gonna come back up here
He's gonna walk out on you

01:32:41.792 --> 01:32:47.539
Now, what you've got to figure
is why you and your boy are gonna die ...

01:32:50.597 --> 01:32:53.846
... because of Butterfield's railroad loss of money?

01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:24.549
They're all of them?

01:33:29.892 --> 01:33:30.821
Almost.

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:35.090
Your move, general

01:33:39.397 --> 01:33:41.226
What do you expect him to say?

01:33:41.666 --> 01:33:43.295
I expect him to say something that makes sense.

01:33:44.304 --> 01:33:46.532
Something that might save the two of you.

01:33:47.012 --> 01:33:50.791
Take a look, Dan
What's the matter? You don't want to see?

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:52.830
I'll see them soon enough

01:33:53.838 --> 01:33:55.118
What about you, kid?
You wanna  look?

01:33:55.138 --> 01:33:56.407
Stay away from the window, William.

01:33:56.947 --> 01:33:58.206
Go on take a look.

01:34:00.015 --> 01:34:02.854
They're animals
All of them

01:34:07.552 --> 01:34:10.301
They're gonna kill you and your father, William

01:34:12.559 --> 01:34:14.808
And I'll laugh while they do it

01:34:15.118 --> 01:34:16.347
I think you know that

01:34:16.997 --> 01:34:18.156
Call them them off

01:34:20.624 --> 01:34:21.604
Why should I?

01:34:22.383 --> 01:34:23.573
Because you're not all bad

01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:29.789
Yes, I am

01:34:30.689 --> 01:34:33.188
Your saved us from those Indians.
-I saved myself

01:34:34.027 --> 01:34:36.631
You got us through the tunnels
You helped us get away

01:34:37.021 --> 01:34:40.919
If I had a gun in them tunnels,
I would've used it on you.

01:34:45.656 --> 01:34:46.626
I don't believe you.

01:34:47.155 --> 01:34:52.153
Kid, I wouldn't last 5 minutes leading an outfit
like that if I wasn't as rotten as hell.

01:35:12.882 --> 01:35:13.872
Dan, ...

01:35:23.295 --> 01:35:24.285
I can't do it,

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:27.483
Dan, and if I can't do it,
you shouldn't do it either

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:32.390
They say discretion is the (better?) part of valor

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.839
If you think that you have an
olbigation to me or to the railroad...

01:35:35.099 --> 01:35:38.686
... I assure you you do not, I'm releasing you

01:35:39.196 --> 01:35:42.795
It's just you left, Dan. Just you and your boy

01:35:43.414 --> 01:35:46.768
Maybe he is right, Pa,
maybe we should go home

01:35:54.224 --> 01:35:57.362
What did Doc Potter gave his life for, William?

01:35:58.622 --> 01:35:59.671
And McElroy?

01:35:59.771 --> 01:36:01.859
Little red ants on a hill

01:36:01.530 --> 01:36:05.977
I'll pay you the $200, Dan. Right now.
And you can walk away

01:36:10.714 --> 01:36:14.612
You know, this whole ride,
it's been nagging on me ...

01:36:17.211 --> 01:36:19.700
... that's what the government
gave me for my leg ...

01:36:21.399 --> 01:36:24.848
... $198.36 and the funny thing is that...

01:36:25.887 --> 01:36:26.887
... when you think about it ...

01:36:27.506 --> 01:36:36.761
... -which I have been lately-
is that they weren't paying me to walk away.
They were paying me so they could walk away.

01:36:38.730 --> 01:36:40.799
Don't muddy the past on the present, Dan

01:36:41.039 --> 01:36:44.267
No, no, no, Wade. I'm seeing the world the way it is

01:36:45.136 --> 01:36:48.025
If you take him to the train, Pa, I'm going with you

01:36:48.105 --> 01:36:50.843
No, Mr. Butterfield's gonna take you home

01:36:51.323 --> 01:36:53.537
No, I'm not going any...
-Yes, you are

01:36:53.667 --> 01:36:55.036
I'm staying here with you

01:36:55.336 --> 01:36:59.255
You're going to hold up in the room
across the hall. You're going to wait until we leave.

01:36:59.774 --> 01:37:02.262
I'll get him to Bigsby.
You've got my promise

01:37:02.552 --> 01:37:04.241
You're going to promise a lot more than that, Butterfield

01:37:05.351 --> 01:37:13.076
I want guarantees that Hollander and his boys
will never set foot on my land again

01:37:13.476 --> 01:37:21.092
And that my water is going to flow.
And I expect you to hand my wife $1000 cash
when you see her. You've got money to spare

01:37:21.292 --> 01:37:25.310
I can deliver that, just get him on the train.

01:37:27.239 --> 01:37:29.638
You heard him?
-I heard him.

01:37:31.837 --> 01:37:33.226
William...

01:37:34.106 --> 01:37:36.504
...I want you to give this back to your mother

01:37:38.713 --> 01:37:44.739
I want you to tell her it helped
me find what is right

01:37:50.117 --> 01:37:54.644
Pa, I can't just leave you

01:37:55.014 --> 01:38:00.961
I'm going to be a day behind you, William
Unless something happens. And if it does,
I need a man at the ranch

01:38:01.986 --> 01:38:06.743
To run things; to protect our family.
And I know that you can do that because
you've become a fine man, William

01:38:08.083 --> 01:38:10.311
You've become a fine man
You've got all the best parts of me ...

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:12.880
... what few there are

01:38:18.287 --> 01:38:27.132
And you just remember
that your old man hauled Ben Wade to that station
when nobody else would

01:39:21.868 --> 01:39:24.867
You know, squeezing that watch won't stop time

01:39:32.102 --> 01:39:33.462
Don't get so scared.

01:39:33.912 --> 01:39:35.091
You might (pack?) a bad mood.

01:39:43.576 --> 01:39:45.076
Ever read the Bible, Dan?

01:39:47.794 --> 01:39:58.059
I read it one time. I was 8 years old. My daddy had just got
himself killed over a shot of whiskey and my mom said we
were going back East to start over

01:39:59.588 --> 01:40:04.115
So she gave me a Bible, sat me down at
the train station. Told me to read it

01:40:07.604 --> 01:40:09.193
She was going to get our tickets

01:40:11.761 --> 01:40:17.038
Well, I did what she said ...
I read that Bible cover to cover.

01:40:17.358 --> 01:40:18.593
It took me 3 days

01:40:22.171 --> 01:40:23.371
She never came back.

01:40:50.086 --> 01:40:50.985
It's time

01:41:08.496 --> 01:41:10.734
It's a half mile to the station from here, Dan

01:41:14.733 --> 01:41:15.832
I guess we're walking

01:41:55.196 --> 01:41:56.185
Lucky

01:41:59.924 --> 01:42:00.583
Dan...

01:42:33.955 --> 01:42:37.319
You're not gonna get a chance
to use those Scofields, Charlie

01:42:38.678 --> 01:42:42.537
Perhaps you can explain to me
the next portion of your plan, Dan

01:43:05.933 --> 01:43:07.902
Hey!
Hey!!

01:43:08.612 --> 01:43:11.990
Not the black hat!

01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:15.979
(?) you dumb shits!

01:43:26.693 --> 01:43:27.561
Charlie.

01:43:31.299 --> 01:43:32.658
Get back!
Get back!

01:43:38.794 --> 01:43:39.694
Boss!

01:43:44.787 --> 01:43:47.915
Let's go! White Door!
Move it!

01:44:11.442 --> 01:44:12.671
I can't do this no more, Dan

01:44:18.449 --> 01:44:20.348
I'm putting you on that train, Wade

01:44:19.678 --> 01:44:24.656
I'm going back!
Your boy is gone, hero. Ain't nobody watching no more

01:44:25.366 --> 01:44:29.343
You still got that one good leg,
why don't you use it to get on home?

01:44:30.063 --> 01:44:30.962
Charlie!

01:44:32.661 --> 01:44:33.461
Charlie Prince!

01:44:33.861 --> 01:44:35.959
Yeah, boss!
-Hold your fire!

01:44:36.469 --> 01:44:37.398
I'm walking out

01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:06.208
I have never been no hero, Wade

01:45:08.407 --> 01:45:11.235
Only (action?) I've seen, it was a retreat ...

01:45:12.145 --> 01:45:14.544
... my foot got shot off by one of my own men.

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:19.571
You try telling that story to your boy ...

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:21.939
... see how he looks at you then

01:45:37.971 --> 01:45:38.871
Boss!

01:45:43.708 --> 01:45:44.877
Ok, Dan

01:45:56.121 --> 01:45:57.081
Son.

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:02.413
They're on the move
They're on the move!

01:46:03.603 --> 01:46:06.801
Boss, Boss..

01:46:41.733 --> 01:46:42.782
Can you make this?
- Yeah

01:47:48.001 --> 01:47:48.811
Spread out!...

01:48:01.423 --> 01:48:03.472
What time is it?

01:48:03.932 --> 01:48:04.942
Quarter past three

01:48:05.532 --> 01:48:07.831
Where is the 3:10 to Yuma?

01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:08.940
Running late, I suppose

01:48:09.769 --> 01:48:10.918
How late?

01:48:12.158 --> 01:48:12.987
Beats me

01:48:13.037 --> 01:48:14.137
It gets here when it gets here

01:48:15.526 --> 01:48:17.860
God damned trains,
You never can rely on them, huh?

01:48:57.659 --> 01:49:03.026
You know...
I ain't stubborn.

01:49:03.856 --> 01:49:04.855
Excuse me?

01:49:06.145 --> 01:49:10.552
You said I was stubborn for
keeping my family on a dying ranch

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.350
It's my son, Mark

01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:16.089
The young one

01:49:16.849 --> 01:49:19.656
He got tuberculosis when he was 2

01:49:21.306 --> 01:49:24.424
Doctor said he'd die
if he didn't have a dry climate

01:49:24.934 --> 01:49:26.568
Why are you telling me this?

01:49:28.877 --> 01:49:29.857
I don't know

01:49:30.966 --> 01:49:35.064
I guess that I just
wanted you to know that ...

01:49:35.373 --> 01:49:39.372
... I ain't stubborn. That's all

01:50:13.533 --> 01:50:16.662
Well, as long as we're making confesions
- Yeah?

01:50:17.362 --> 01:50:21.659
I've been to Yuma Prison before

01:50:21.759 --> 01:50:25.057
Twice
Escaped twice too

01:51:30.777 --> 01:51:34.265
First car, sliding door

01:51:45.433 --> 01:51:46.583
They'll be coming

01:52:26.881 --> 01:52:30.100
I've got a prisoner to go to Yuma

01:52:35.676 --> 01:52:37.885
Well, you did it, Dan

01:52:39.584 --> 01:52:40.214
No!

01:52:50.578 --> 01:52:52.902
Pa!

01:53:20.517 --> 01:53:24.705
For a one legged rancher, ...

01:53:26.844 --> 01:53:29.933
... he's one tough son of a bitch

01:54:36.812 --> 01:54:37.642
You done it, Pa

01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:45.937
You done it.
You got him on the train

01:55:42.463 --> 01:55:43.251
Pa

01:55:44.305 --> 01:55:50.175
