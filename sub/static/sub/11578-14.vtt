WEBVTT

00:01.020 --> 00:02.996
In the criminal
justice system...

00:03.068 --> 00:06.265
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.524 --> 00:08.664
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.732 --> 00:10.555
who investigate
these vicious felonies...

00:10.620 --> 00:13.686
are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.076 --> 00:15.352
These are their stories.

00:16.988 --> 00:18.647
So I got all the cables
hooked up.

00:18.716 --> 00:20.603
I tried to print, nothing.

00:20.668 --> 00:23.450
My 10-year-old comes over, a few
clicks on the mouse, it works.

00:23.515 --> 00:27.257
It's getting so that you can't navigate
a computer, it's like being illiterate.

00:27.835 --> 00:29.242
We're dinosaurs.

00:29.307 --> 00:31.860
31, silent alarm
at Lorenzo Storage.

00:31.931 --> 00:34.713
569 West 124 Street.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.757
Sector car's at the house.
Let's take it.

00:36.827 --> 00:38.234
One Sergeant responding.

00:38.715 --> 00:40.176
Copy that, One Sergeant.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:56.537 --> 00:57.487
You okay?

00:57.562 --> 00:59.799
Banged my foot
on some piece of crap.

01:00.601 --> 01:02.129
You want to check over there?

01:11.801 --> 01:13.394
I don't see anything.

01:15.545 --> 01:16.788
Karen?

01:18.200 --> 01:19.094
Karen?

01:19.160 --> 01:21.910
Service, we're right around
the corner going to back up...

01:21.976 --> 01:24.278
One Sergeant
at Lorenzo Storage.

01:24.343 --> 01:25.521
Karen?

01:26.679 --> 01:27.661
You in there?

01:27.736 --> 01:29.677
One David. ETA to Lorenzo
Storage, one minute.

01:29.752 --> 01:31.442
We got backup on the way!

01:31.513 --> 01:32.853
You hold on!

01:34.231 --> 01:35.344
10-13.

01:35.415 --> 01:37.935
One Sergeant.
10-13 at this location.

01:38.007 --> 01:40.309
Officer needs help!

01:42.582 --> 01:43.596
What's up?

01:43.670 --> 01:45.710
We got a 10-13
eight blocks away.

01:46.071 --> 01:47.346
You all right?

01:47.990 --> 01:49.135
Yeah. Drive.

01:50.167 --> 01:51.181
It's the pills, isn't it?

01:51.254 --> 01:52.203
Yeah.

01:52.983 --> 01:54.292
Ambulance is on the way.

01:54.358 --> 01:56.213
Wish they got here
as fast as you did.

01:56.278 --> 01:57.293
What happened?

01:57.527 --> 02:00.243
Sergeant and the driver took a
call for a silent alarm break-in.

02:00.311 --> 02:02.318
They got separated,
perp grabbed the Sergeant.

02:02.389 --> 02:03.337
Where'd you find her?

02:03.414 --> 02:05.901
In the stairwell with her pants
down. Looks like he raped her...

02:05.974 --> 02:07.664
after he put a garbage bag
over her head.

02:07.735 --> 02:10.832
The perp got out of the building through
an emergency exit in the stairwell...

02:10.901 --> 02:12.145
with her gun and wallet.

02:16.565 --> 02:17.776
How's she doing?

02:18.293 --> 02:19.308
Pretty bad.

02:19.380 --> 02:21.551
We didn't move her in case
she hurt her neck or something.

02:21.620 --> 02:26.192
The perp used some kind of blunt object
to choke her. A piece of pipe or something.

02:26.388 --> 02:27.336
A crowbar?

02:27.412 --> 02:29.234
Make sure they check
for prints on the door.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.315
CSU's en route.

02:30.708 --> 02:32.846
The rest of the squad's
looking for the doer.

02:38.067 --> 02:39.114
Oh, God.

02:39.603 --> 02:40.913
What's the matter?

02:41.971 --> 02:43.248
That's Karen Smythe.

02:43.699 --> 02:45.041
She trained me.

03:39.025 --> 03:40.486
How long was she in there?

03:40.559 --> 03:41.672
I'm not sure.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.270
At least five minutes.

03:43.343 --> 03:44.292
More like ten.

03:44.655 --> 03:45.833
Felt like an hour.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.429
Take it easy, Mitch.

03:47.503 --> 03:49.096
I got too far
ahead of her.

03:49.488 --> 03:51.397
All I could do was bang
on that door.

03:51.470 --> 03:52.845
You scared the perp off.

03:52.911 --> 03:54.854
Come on. You can't be
blaming yourself, all right?

03:54.927 --> 03:56.301
I'm her partner.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.188
Guys, my boss
has just arrived.

03:58.254 --> 04:00.229
I expect all of you down
at our offices in an hour.

04:00.303 --> 04:01.579
Anything we can do.

04:03.693 --> 04:05.035
How's she doing?

04:05.391 --> 04:06.339
Semi-conscious.

04:06.415 --> 04:09.676
Doctor says her airway wasn't cut off
long enough to cause any brain damage.

04:09.743 --> 04:10.690
Where's your partner?

04:10.765 --> 04:12.195
She's in there with her.

04:12.270 --> 04:13.928
They've got history.

04:16.524 --> 04:17.834
She able to give you anything?

04:17.901 --> 04:18.850
Not yet.

04:18.925 --> 04:19.874
What'd the partner say?

04:19.950 --> 04:20.898
Nothing too reliable.

04:20.973 --> 04:23.013
The guy's still in shock.
You know her, Olivia?

04:23.086 --> 04:24.033
She got any family?

04:24.109 --> 04:25.287
Just her ex-husband.

04:25.357 --> 04:26.535
We'll do the notification.

04:26.604 --> 04:28.547
I'm going to stay with her
in case she wakes up.

04:28.621 --> 04:31.009
Okay. Look, everybody's
working this one.

04:31.084 --> 04:33.572
Nobody's going home.
She wakes up, says anything...

04:33.645 --> 04:34.889
I'll call you.

04:57.867 --> 04:59.906
He broke in
through this door...

04:59.979 --> 05:02.498
raped and robbed
Sergeant Karen Smythe...

05:02.954 --> 05:05.856
and now this perp
has a cop's gun as a trophy.

05:06.314 --> 05:07.841
We got to get him in fast.

05:07.914 --> 05:09.059
Anything from Forensics?

05:09.130 --> 05:11.071
Found the crowbar outside
the back of the warehouse.

05:11.146 --> 05:14.626
CSU went to the hospital to see if the
rust on it matches marks on Sergeant Smythe.

05:14.698 --> 05:16.105
Similar burglaries?

05:16.170 --> 05:17.097
Checking.

05:17.161 --> 05:19.911
Crowbar isn't exactly
a unique method of entry.

05:19.978 --> 05:22.661
It's possible this guy was a
burglar who saw a woman alone...

05:22.729 --> 05:25.314
as an opportunity, but for
now we rule nothing out.

05:25.544 --> 05:29.702
Any other rape cases where the perp used
a garbage bag to cover the victim's head?

05:32.168 --> 05:33.313
I'll call on that.

05:34.409 --> 05:36.296
Everybody else,
hit the street.

05:36.585 --> 05:39.749
Canvass for perp sightings,
possible witnesses.

05:39.913 --> 05:42.498
Finding this guy is job one.
He tried to kill a cop.

05:42.568 --> 05:44.989
He's not going to care
who his next victim is.

05:48.136 --> 05:49.859
You look like the one
who got strangled.

05:49.928 --> 05:50.876
I'm okay.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.096
Elliot, a minute?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.611
You forgot to call
on the pattern rapes.

05:56.678 --> 05:57.727
I was just getting to it.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.523
Elliot. Get some rest.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.653
A cop was just raped
and nearly choked to death.

06:02.727 --> 06:05.093
This anti-HIV medicine
is still making you sick.

06:05.159 --> 06:06.849
Take some time
until you're done with it.

06:06.919 --> 06:08.380
You think I'm not
up to the job?

06:08.455 --> 06:10.756
You saved a life,
exposed yourself to HIV.

06:10.822 --> 06:12.066
You have nothing to prove.

06:12.133 --> 06:13.792
Is it an order?
Not yet.

06:14.983 --> 06:17.349
Trust me to come to you
if it's a problem.

06:23.206 --> 06:25.824
We came up the back stairs,
heard pounding on the door.

06:26.021 --> 06:28.672
Followed the noise to the
front stairs, came down.

06:28.742 --> 06:30.269
Sergeant Smythe
was lying there.

06:30.438 --> 06:31.648
Any sign of the perp?

06:31.813 --> 06:32.925
Nothing but the crowbar.

06:32.996 --> 06:33.946
We didn't go after him.

06:34.182 --> 06:35.774
We were more concerned
about the Sarge.

06:35.846 --> 06:37.601
Where were you guys
when you got the call?

06:37.669 --> 06:39.971
About ten blocks away, in
our sector, on a meal break.

06:40.037 --> 06:41.727
You know how it is
when you get a 13.

06:41.797 --> 06:43.553
Cop's in trouble,
we haul ass.

06:43.621 --> 06:46.270
You guys work the area. Anybody
on your radar could have done this?

06:46.340 --> 06:48.128
That part of the precinct
is skell heaven.

06:48.196 --> 06:49.919
Just toss out a net
and haul them in.

06:50.019 --> 06:51.547
You hear anything
from the hospital?

06:51.621 --> 06:53.857
15 minutes ago.
She's not conscious yet.

06:56.292 --> 06:57.240
When did you lose her?

06:57.380 --> 07:00.031
I don't know. She was behind
me, and then she was gone.

07:00.387 --> 07:03.454
The place was so dark, you couldn't
see your hand in front of your face.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.865
And then you saw
her flashlight?

07:04.930 --> 07:07.965
Yeah. I heard noises from
behind the stairwell door.

07:12.546 --> 07:15.197
Just breathe. Relax. Come on.
Take your time. Sit down.

07:15.747 --> 07:16.859
It's hard, you know?

07:16.931 --> 07:20.030
I do know. Is this when
you called for backup?

07:20.099 --> 07:21.113
Yeah.

07:21.185 --> 07:22.396
The door was locked.

07:22.562 --> 07:23.707
It happened so fast.

07:23.906 --> 07:25.248
How long before they arrived?

07:25.698 --> 07:29.276
After I called the 13, couldn't have
been more than a couple of minutes.

07:29.890 --> 07:32.377
Bates and Towne opened
the door from the inside.

07:39.265 --> 07:40.378
Hey.

07:44.257 --> 07:45.566
How long you been up?

07:45.633 --> 07:47.095
Couple of hours.

07:47.809 --> 07:49.370
I didn't want to wake you.

07:50.848 --> 07:52.604
You're still taking care
of the rookie?

07:52.672 --> 07:54.778
Looks like
it's the other way around.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.903
We're going to get
this bastard, Karen.

07:59.968 --> 08:01.342
You can count on that.

08:01.856 --> 08:05.336
I might be worried if you were
still as green as when I got you.

08:09.504 --> 08:10.583
Do you remember the time...

08:10.654 --> 08:13.175
when the Lieutenant sent me
up to the roof of the precinct?

08:14.527 --> 08:17.593
To turn the lights on so that the
captain could land his chopper...

08:17.663 --> 08:19.037
and inspect the building?

08:20.063 --> 08:21.372
You asked me...

08:21.983 --> 08:25.779
if you needed red paddles
to guide him in.

08:26.302 --> 08:28.342
I didn't take that too well, did I? No!

08:28.414 --> 08:29.756
No, not at all.

08:29.823 --> 08:31.033
Rookie paranoia.

08:31.550 --> 08:34.485
If they didn't like you, they'd
have picked on someone else.

08:42.428 --> 08:43.956
Last night, I froze.

08:45.789 --> 08:48.123
It was like
I was outside of my body...

08:48.540 --> 08:50.199
looking down at myself.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.371
You dissociated.
That's normal.

08:53.277 --> 08:54.226
I know.

08:57.533 --> 08:58.677
What do you remember?

09:00.829 --> 09:02.137
We were in the warehouse.

09:03.356 --> 09:04.785
Mitch tripped...

09:05.053 --> 09:06.546
I asked him if he was okay.

09:06.620 --> 09:10.034
Couldn't see anything that wasn't in
the flashlight beam, it was so dark.

09:11.483 --> 09:13.523
Then someone grabbed me
by the throat.

09:16.092 --> 09:17.750
Put something over my head.

09:20.699 --> 09:21.746
What was it?

09:22.523 --> 09:23.832
It was a plastic bag.

09:26.523 --> 09:27.951
Then he dragged me...

09:28.219 --> 09:29.680
then he threw me down...

09:29.817 --> 09:31.508
tore my pants off...

09:32.154 --> 09:33.977
and then he was inside me.

09:35.930 --> 09:37.141
He never said a word.

09:39.450 --> 09:42.515
Then he put something hard
against my throat.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.661
Like a pipe.

09:44.729 --> 09:45.657
Yeah.

09:45.721 --> 09:48.176
We think that was the crowbar
that he used to break in.

09:51.673 --> 09:52.622
I couldn't breathe.

09:54.841 --> 09:57.710
Next thing, I'm looking
at you sleeping there.

10:05.144 --> 10:06.867
Was the rape kit positive?

10:06.936 --> 10:09.653
It's not back yet, but the
Luma Light didn't show anything.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.798
Any suspects?

10:11.864 --> 10:12.975
Not yet.

10:14.552 --> 10:17.617
Then stop babysitting me
and go find one.

10:21.943 --> 10:22.893
Okay.

10:25.591 --> 10:26.540
Hey...

10:26.807 --> 10:28.236
you feeling any better?

10:28.311 --> 10:30.133
Yeah. I caught some sleep
up in the crib.

10:30.199 --> 10:32.336
How's Smythe?
She's awake.

10:32.407 --> 10:33.684
She's going to be okay.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.027
Say anything?
No.

10:35.799 --> 10:36.878
You sure you're okay?

10:37.846 --> 10:40.748
You tell Cragen about what happened
last night? Me getting sick?

10:40.822 --> 10:42.961
You heard what I said. You
were standing right there.

10:43.030 --> 10:44.306
I haven't seen him since.
Why?

10:44.374 --> 10:45.900
Boss wanted
to send me home.

10:45.974 --> 10:48.046
But he didn't.
Good decision.

10:48.470 --> 10:50.609
But that stuff right there,
that'll kill you.

10:50.677 --> 10:52.237
Yeah. Have you been
in the squad room?

10:52.309 --> 10:53.870
No. Why?
Hold your nose.

10:55.573 --> 10:56.947
Lab call yet?
Nope.

10:57.397 --> 10:59.284
They're taking
their sweet time.

10:59.381 --> 11:00.330
Sit.

11:01.684 --> 11:03.594
I can't take much more
of this stench.

11:03.668 --> 11:07.792
Eau de cologne of the streets. The sights,
sounds, aromas of the "other" New York.

11:07.860 --> 11:09.649
This guy you need
gloves to handle.

11:11.028 --> 11:12.337
You know where you are?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.049
It ain't an outhouse.

11:15.124 --> 11:16.979
It ain't the White House.

11:17.396 --> 11:19.436
So it might be
the stationhouse.

11:19.605 --> 11:20.586
Good guess.

11:20.660 --> 11:23.823
Easier to sweep the sands off the beach
than get anything out of these guys.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.550
Hey, we got a live one.

11:27.155 --> 11:28.171
Overtime?

11:28.244 --> 11:29.258
Our own time.

11:29.331 --> 11:31.022
What's so special
about this one?

11:31.091 --> 11:32.039
This.

11:32.371 --> 11:34.892
We found him sleeping down
the block from the warehouse.

11:34.964 --> 11:35.911
Nice work.

11:36.179 --> 11:37.704
You want in
on this interrogation?

11:37.779 --> 11:39.240
No. We just want
to get some sleep.

11:39.315 --> 11:42.031
He comes up as the doer,
collar's all yours.

11:43.762 --> 11:44.972
You're in deep doo-doo.

11:45.042 --> 11:47.246
I swear, I found it
in a dumpster.

11:47.314 --> 11:48.263
When?

11:49.682 --> 11:50.860
I don't wear no watch.

11:50.929 --> 11:52.140
What dumpster?

11:52.210 --> 11:54.576
A few blocks from where
they found that police lady.

11:55.666 --> 11:57.607
I ain't had no part in that.

11:57.746 --> 12:01.422
I was sleeping in an alley during
all that commotion nonsense.

12:01.489 --> 12:04.936
Let's continue this scintillating
repartee in more comfortable surroundings.

12:05.009 --> 12:06.503
You got something
to eat back there?

12:06.577 --> 12:07.919
We'll see what
we can scrounge up.

12:07.985 --> 12:09.327
Okay. Thank you.

12:09.777 --> 12:11.021
Guys, wait a minute.

12:11.824 --> 12:12.718
What?

12:12.785 --> 12:14.726
Last week, a woman
in Queens was raped...

12:14.800 --> 12:16.905
nearly choked to death
in a warehouse.

12:16.976 --> 12:18.537
The perp broke
into that warehouse...

12:18.608 --> 12:20.910
using a crowbar.
Three days ago she woke up...

12:20.975 --> 12:22.951
and told Queens SVU...

12:23.472 --> 12:25.511
her attacker put a plastic bag
over her head.

12:27.248 --> 12:28.459
A repeater.

12:28.527 --> 12:30.021
Carrying a cop's gun.

12:33.968 --> 12:36.423
I was in the back
of the warehouse...

12:36.527 --> 12:37.836
doing inventory.

12:38.223 --> 12:39.467
What time was it?

12:40.399 --> 12:41.446
About 10:30.

12:42.286 --> 12:44.196
I hear footsteps...

12:44.559 --> 12:47.559
and I thought it was Cathy,
this girl that I work with.

12:47.694 --> 12:48.643
What happened?

12:49.102 --> 12:51.241
I got down off the ladder...

12:52.463 --> 12:53.891
and he grabbed me.

12:54.702 --> 12:56.295
Put a bag over my head...

12:56.366 --> 12:57.772
and he started punching me.

12:59.661 --> 13:02.760
He threw me down
on a stack of boxes...

13:03.918 --> 13:06.438
and I couldn't stop him.
He raped me.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.634
Did you get a look at him?

13:11.054 --> 13:12.001
No.

13:12.077 --> 13:13.189
After he raped you?

13:13.261 --> 13:14.189
He choked me.

13:14.253 --> 13:16.772
Next thing I knew,
I woke up in the hospital.

13:16.844 --> 13:18.568
Did he take anything
from you?

13:20.940 --> 13:23.624
A gold cross that
I wear around my neck.

13:23.691 --> 13:25.448
He just ripped it right off.

13:26.828 --> 13:28.421
What about
what he said to you?

13:30.060 --> 13:31.489
He didn't say a word.

13:34.796 --> 13:35.908
Thank you.

13:41.099 --> 13:44.328
Queens rape victim described the
same M.O. as the attack on Smythe.

13:44.396 --> 13:47.144
Anything on the homeless guy
you picked up with Smythe's I.D.?

13:47.210 --> 13:50.244
He spent the night swilling Mad Dog
with three of his backstreet bunkies.

13:50.315 --> 13:51.525
They tell you that?

13:51.594 --> 13:54.245
In a rare moment of lucidity,
after about 10 cups of coffee.

13:54.314 --> 13:56.550
Okay, rule him out
as our serial rapist.

13:56.619 --> 13:57.567
Anything from the lab?

13:57.642 --> 13:59.747
So far, zero.
They haven't called us.

13:59.817 --> 14:02.370
Then get down there and light
a Bunsen burner under them.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.448
Munch, Fin, check out
Smythe's past cases.

14:04.522 --> 14:05.798
What are we looking for?

14:05.867 --> 14:07.688
Anybody with a grudge.

14:09.225 --> 14:10.949
I have five homicides
from last weekend.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.839
Your victim isn't even dead.
Take a number.

14:12.905 --> 14:15.239
And we have a cop who may be
the victim of a serial rapist.

14:15.305 --> 14:17.279
He has her gun.
This should be top priority.

14:17.353 --> 14:18.629
What do you want me
to tell you?

14:18.697 --> 14:20.869
That you'll put your foot on
the gas instead of the brake.

14:20.936 --> 14:22.245
You've had
the rape kit for days.

14:22.313 --> 14:24.254
Do we have to go over your
head to get things done?

14:24.328 --> 14:25.670
Can't give you
what I don't have.

14:25.736 --> 14:28.038
Felicia, come on.
Help us out here. You know us.

14:29.928 --> 14:32.066
Positive for spermicide,
negative for semen.

14:32.137 --> 14:33.729
So the rapist used a condom?

14:33.801 --> 14:34.913
That wasn't so hard, was it?

14:34.984 --> 14:36.096
Spare me the sarcasm.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.720
So, there's no DNA?
No, I didn't say that.

14:38.791 --> 14:42.020
Rape kit turned up one hair,
follicle still attached.

14:42.663 --> 14:44.550
Find me a suspect,
I'll match it.

14:44.999 --> 14:46.788
Anything else you want
to share with us?

14:46.854 --> 14:49.953
They find out I told you about the
rape kit, I'm in enough trouble.

14:51.783 --> 14:52.928
What was that about?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.493
Someone's covering up.

14:57.286 --> 14:59.196
What do you say
we take another look?

15:05.957 --> 15:07.267
Seal's broken.

15:12.581 --> 15:14.523
Looks like somebody's
done some housekeeping.

15:14.597 --> 15:16.669
So much for securing
the crime scene.

15:16.742 --> 15:17.789
What the hell
is going on?

15:17.862 --> 15:18.875
Let's find out.

15:20.229 --> 15:21.823
They were in here
this morning.

15:21.893 --> 15:22.908
Who?

15:22.980 --> 15:25.827
Two cops in windbreakers. Said they
had to finish collecting evidence.

15:25.893 --> 15:27.300
Don't you guys
talk to each other?

15:27.366 --> 15:29.088
They tell you
what unit they were from?

15:29.573 --> 15:31.296
Why would I need to know that?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.153
Someone ran a hose in there.

15:33.668 --> 15:36.735
Yeah, I delegated it to one
of my numerous employees. Me.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.658
Did you ask these cops
if that was okay?

15:40.068 --> 15:41.529
It was their idea.

15:50.914 --> 15:53.184
Hey! Get away from my desk!
What're you doing?

15:53.732 --> 15:55.422
Private property,
gentlemen.

15:55.492 --> 15:57.858
Lieutenants Coates and
Waldman, Internal Affairs...

15:57.923 --> 15:59.897
Detectives Stabler and Benson.

16:00.355 --> 16:02.559
You find anything incriminating
in my wife's photo?

16:02.627 --> 16:04.667
If you're hungry,
I left a candy bar there.

16:04.739 --> 16:07.521
It's a Hershey bar on the second
drawer on the left. Sorry, no cheese.

16:07.586 --> 16:09.015
We're going to have
to ask you some questions.

16:09.091 --> 16:10.203
About what?

16:10.274 --> 16:11.582
It won't take long.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.595
Use your office, Captain?

16:13.665 --> 16:15.040
Yeah. Sure, why not?

16:15.266 --> 16:17.884
My desk is unlocked
if you need anything.

16:23.105 --> 16:24.087
Have a seat.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.110
We'll stand. Thanks.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.750
What's this about?

16:28.961 --> 16:31.677
Is all the paperwork on your cases
for the last month up to date?

16:31.745 --> 16:33.981
We wouldn't be doing our
job properly if it wasn't.

16:34.049 --> 16:34.997
So that's a yes.

16:35.072 --> 16:36.959
Is this going anywhere?
We've got work to do.

16:37.025 --> 16:37.973
So do we.

16:38.048 --> 16:40.089
We'll need all your files
by the end of business today.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.681
You want our files, you're looking
through our desks. For what?

16:44.193 --> 16:45.883
This about the Smythe case?

16:46.688 --> 16:49.655
Lab's holding back, crime scene's
been cleaned up. What's going on?

16:50.751 --> 16:51.864
Thanks for your cooperation.

16:51.936 --> 16:52.983
Thank you.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.311
Internal Affairs
investigates crooked cops.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.627
We know we're clean.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.837
The KGB of the NYPD.

16:59.904 --> 17:03.252
Cast suspicion like McCarthy, keep
secret files like J. Edgar Hoover...

17:03.327 --> 17:05.530
get everybody to the point
where they trust nobody.

17:05.598 --> 17:07.159
What are you
talking about now?

17:07.231 --> 17:11.288
I'm talking about these field associates
IAB recruits fresh out of the academy...

17:11.358 --> 17:14.141
who become spies among us. Moles
ratting on their fellow cops...

17:14.207 --> 17:16.116
until they put in their 20
and collect their pension.

17:16.190 --> 17:17.467
I don't like them
any better than you...

17:17.534 --> 17:19.444
but you're honest, you got
nothing to worry about.

17:19.518 --> 17:22.387
There's 40,000 cops on the job.
There's bound to be a few bad apples.

17:22.462 --> 17:23.477
What'd they want?

17:23.550 --> 17:24.597
Case files.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.644
Case files for the last month.

17:27.165 --> 17:29.619
Either one of us could
be under investigation.

17:29.693 --> 17:31.122
Or both of us.

17:31.197 --> 17:32.179
Maybe Karen Smythe.

17:32.254 --> 17:34.108
Karen Smythe wouldn't take
a cup of coffee.

17:36.764 --> 17:37.909
Whatever you say.

17:39.644 --> 17:41.105
We got files to deliver.

17:42.875 --> 17:45.526
IAB sniffing around
gives me the creeps.

17:45.597 --> 17:48.891
A little bit of the former Soviet
bloc's policing methods here in New York.

17:48.956 --> 17:50.516
Guilty until
proven innocent.

17:50.589 --> 17:53.206
But even if you're innocent,
the stigma of an IAB inquiry...

17:53.276 --> 17:54.836
sticks to you
like a bad debt.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.020
Where do you get
this stuff?

17:56.092 --> 17:58.458
Simple observations.
What did you find out?

17:58.620 --> 18:01.783
Nothing I was going to say in
front of Benson after that reaction.

18:01.916 --> 18:04.119
Smythe and her husband
got divorced a year ago.

18:04.187 --> 18:05.561
Irreconcilable differences?

18:05.627 --> 18:08.016
Hubby taking too many trips
to Atlantic City.

18:08.090 --> 18:10.425
Almost drove her into
bankruptcy with his gambling.

18:10.491 --> 18:13.655
Had to sell the house last summer
to pay off the credit card debt...

18:13.723 --> 18:15.414
to the tune of $70,000.

18:15.802 --> 18:17.012
The cost of freedom.

18:17.337 --> 18:18.266
For her.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.819
He's still paying his bills
late as of last month.

18:20.890 --> 18:22.265
That one of the 12 steps?

18:23.163 --> 18:24.110
Maybe we should ask him.

18:28.026 --> 18:29.204
Thank God she's okay.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.899
You still on
speaking terms?

18:30.970 --> 18:34.231
She called to tell me what
happened. We don't talk that often.

18:34.298 --> 18:35.574
How long were you married?

18:35.642 --> 18:36.818
Twelve years.

18:37.144 --> 18:38.705
Honeymoon lasted ten.

18:38.777 --> 18:41.460
Tough being married to a
cop. Just ask my ex-wives.

18:41.529 --> 18:42.958
It was tough
being married to me.

18:43.033 --> 18:46.480
She risks her life to earn a living,
I blow both our salaries gambling.

18:46.553 --> 18:47.763
It's what broke us up.

18:47.832 --> 18:48.978
You're on the wagon now?

18:49.048 --> 18:51.350
When she left me, I went
to Gamblers Anonymous.

18:51.417 --> 18:52.277
I'm clean.

18:52.343 --> 18:53.554
Well, your credit report
isn't.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.762
You're still borrowing money
against your credit cards...

18:55.831 --> 18:57.490
and forgetting to pay it back. So?

18:58.136 --> 18:59.729
Sounds like you had a relapse.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.229
You're still gambling.

19:01.304 --> 19:04.086
You borrowing any money from somebody
doesn't have a license to lend?

19:05.656 --> 19:06.866
I borrowed from a friend.

19:06.935 --> 19:08.244
You mean a loan shark.

19:08.311 --> 19:09.259
How much?

19:09.847 --> 19:10.795
$100,000.

19:10.872 --> 19:12.245
What's the balance
on the account?

19:12.311 --> 19:13.172
Zero.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.646
How'd you pay it off?

19:14.711 --> 19:18.191
$50,000 on my own. The other
$50,000, anonymous donor.

19:19.639 --> 19:21.427
Hey, I thought
the same thing.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.633
Don't play games with us.
The odds are against you.

19:23.702 --> 19:26.190
No games. I meet him yesterday
to make a payment...

19:26.262 --> 19:27.374
he says it's taken care of.

19:27.447 --> 19:29.683
Taken care of, huh? Somebody
pays off your gambling debt...

19:29.750 --> 19:32.401
and you have no idea who would
perform such an act of philanthropy?

19:32.470 --> 19:35.252
These guys don't just let you
walk away from an obligation.

19:35.830 --> 19:38.580
All I know is that vulture's not
banging down my door any more.

19:38.645 --> 19:39.987
Vulture got a name?

19:40.662 --> 19:42.450
I just know him
as Uncle Sammy.

19:42.516 --> 19:44.622
Hangs out in Chinatown.
Mott Street.

19:48.565 --> 19:49.644
Uncle Sammy.

19:49.717 --> 19:51.309
Can I help you gentlemen?

19:51.381 --> 19:53.169
Yeah. I want to borrow
some money.

19:53.237 --> 19:55.571
I'm sorry, but you must be
mistaking me for a bank.

19:55.636 --> 19:58.931
We take it you specialize in loans
to police officers and their families.

19:58.996 --> 20:00.970
Somebody's giving you
bad information.

20:01.044 --> 20:02.473
You going to stick
to that story?

20:03.220 --> 20:04.148
Wait.

20:04.212 --> 20:05.292
Come on.

20:06.036 --> 20:08.240
What have we here?

20:08.307 --> 20:10.479
"50 Misha W-3 Hiya."

20:10.900 --> 20:12.328
Who's Misha?
My dog.

20:12.403 --> 20:15.699
This knot's for dog food? The
mutt must be eating porterhouse.

20:15.763 --> 20:16.711
I'm an animal lover.

20:16.787 --> 20:19.088
That's good. Because we got a
cage waiting for you at Rikers.

20:19.155 --> 20:21.489
After we arrest you for possession
of these betting slips...

20:21.555 --> 20:23.115
that's where
you're spending the night.

20:23.186 --> 20:24.560
Guys, what do you want?

20:24.627 --> 20:26.448
Who paid off
Todd Smythe's loan?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.235
What loan?
Who's Todd Smythe?

20:28.306 --> 20:30.696
I guess we're going to have to
destroy those illegal documents.

20:30.770 --> 20:32.145
Then he has to explain
to his clients...

20:32.210 --> 20:33.290
why there's no record
of their bets...

20:33.363 --> 20:35.118
when they come
to collect their winnings.

20:35.186 --> 20:37.553
I got a right not
to incriminate myself.

20:37.746 --> 20:39.468
And we have a right
to arrest you.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.833
Unless you got something
else you want to tell us.

20:43.186 --> 20:45.552
Smythe owed me
another $50,000.

20:45.617 --> 20:46.565
Owed?

20:46.641 --> 20:47.655
It was paid off.

20:47.730 --> 20:49.901
By who?
His ex-wife.

20:55.696 --> 20:59.494
Uncle Sammy tell you how she came up
with the better part of a year's salary?

20:59.568 --> 21:00.713
He didn't ask.

21:00.784 --> 21:03.598
My ex's wouldn't throw water
on me if I was on fire.

21:05.296 --> 21:07.052
We're finished playing
messenger service.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.291
Let IAB come
and get those files.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.400
Any idea who they have
their sights on?

21:11.472 --> 21:12.486
Yeah.

21:13.135 --> 21:14.281
Karen Smythe.

21:20.815 --> 21:22.637
You're saying
I'm on the take?

21:22.703 --> 21:24.939
I'm saying that your husband's
loan shark says...

21:25.007 --> 21:26.828
that you paid off
his $50,000 debt.

21:26.895 --> 21:28.902
And you believe him?
Convince me that he's lying.

21:28.975 --> 21:30.697
I don't have to prove
anything to you.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.173
This time, you do.

21:34.830 --> 21:36.618
Where'd you get
the money, Karen?

21:36.878 --> 21:39.049
None of this
concerns you, Olivia.

21:39.310 --> 21:41.645
Boy, I am running out
of reasons to defend you.

21:41.710 --> 21:42.986
Then back off.

21:43.054 --> 21:44.614
I'm doing
what you taught me.

21:44.974 --> 21:46.982
My job.
Investigating your rape.

21:48.366 --> 21:49.707
I wasn't raped.

21:52.654 --> 21:54.246
I remember
what happened now.

21:54.445 --> 21:55.590
I wasn't raped.

21:56.269 --> 21:57.642
Karen, what're you
talking about?

21:57.709 --> 22:01.505
They found you in a stairwell with your
pants pulled down, nearly strangled.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.883
The rape kit was positive
for spermicide, remember?

22:03.948 --> 22:05.158
You going
to recant that, too?

22:05.229 --> 22:06.854
I had sex
before I went on duty.

22:06.924 --> 22:08.005
With who?

22:08.076 --> 22:09.352
An old boyfriend.

22:09.420 --> 22:10.314
His name?

22:10.380 --> 22:12.420
He's married. We both know
that you're going to...

22:12.492 --> 22:14.531
have to eliminate him as a
suspect, so what's his name?

22:17.323 --> 22:19.015
Karen, don't do this.

22:19.820 --> 22:20.802
You want to help?

22:22.316 --> 22:23.264
Drop it.

22:23.340 --> 22:25.313
Who got to you?
Who are you covering for?

22:25.387 --> 22:26.500
Don't push me.

22:26.571 --> 22:27.945
What kind of trouble
are you in?

22:28.011 --> 22:29.735
You're the one causing it.

22:33.515 --> 22:36.679
Well, let's ask Internal Affairs
about it and see what they have to say.

22:38.762 --> 22:39.940
Get out.

22:44.138 --> 22:45.731
She didn't give you anything?

22:45.802 --> 22:47.363
She shut me down.

22:47.434 --> 22:50.598
Chief of Detectives says without
her, we don't have a rape case.

22:50.665 --> 22:52.770
She's recanting her story
because she's scared.

22:52.842 --> 22:54.335
Someone's putting
the screws to her.

22:54.409 --> 22:55.838
Did you check
her financial records?

22:55.914 --> 22:58.052
No loans,
no cash advances...

22:58.121 --> 23:01.089
no $50,000 withdrawn from
any of her savings accounts.

23:01.161 --> 23:02.623
She's not dirty.

23:02.696 --> 23:03.777
You gotta do something.

23:03.849 --> 23:06.532
I'm going to see
the Chief of Departments.

23:06.601 --> 23:08.259
That sounds like
a suicide mission.

23:08.328 --> 23:09.889
Let's hope not.
He's a friend.

23:09.962 --> 23:12.099
Maybe he knows
who's trying to shut us down.

23:12.938 --> 23:13.919
We can't let this go.

23:13.992 --> 23:15.781
We're not. It's our turf.

23:17.703 --> 23:19.843
I'm returning
the doctor's call.

23:19.912 --> 23:22.595
The message said
he had my test results.

23:23.144 --> 23:26.559
I understand that, but if you have them
in front of you, why can't you ju...

23:28.648 --> 23:31.964
You need a medical degree
to read off a piece of paper?

23:34.631 --> 23:35.939
Policy? Okay.

23:36.967 --> 23:39.454
Well, I think you need
a better policy. Thanks a lot.

23:39.559 --> 23:40.639
Problem?

23:41.926 --> 23:44.545
My test results are back.

23:45.062 --> 23:48.030
Policy dictates
only a doctor can...

23:48.646 --> 23:50.075
give them to me.

23:54.373 --> 23:56.260
You need my help, Donnie?

23:56.582 --> 23:59.930
IAB is putting the squeeze
on a couple of my detectives.

24:00.005 --> 24:01.467
Maybe they did
something wrong.

24:01.542 --> 24:04.509
Only mistake they made
was catching the Smythe case.

24:04.581 --> 24:06.785
Is IAB putting
the squeeze on her, too?

24:06.852 --> 24:10.048
Your victim flips on her story,
and you're blaming Internal Affairs?

24:10.277 --> 24:13.573
I ran a corruption task force. I
know when a cop's being fed her lines.

24:13.636 --> 24:15.458
That's a little paranoid,
don't you think?

24:15.524 --> 24:18.656
Twelve years a captain, I can't
get promoted. I'm paranoid.

24:18.948 --> 24:20.858
Don't take advantage
of our friendship.

24:20.932 --> 24:23.354
Karen Smythe is being made
to look like a wrong cop.

24:23.428 --> 24:24.376
Is she one?

24:25.124 --> 24:27.742
Cop's spouse is up to his ass
in debt to some loan shark...

24:27.813 --> 24:30.146
it's guilt by association.
Makes us look bad.

24:30.371 --> 24:31.484
A firing offense.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.273
You're saying
IAB knew about this?

24:34.339 --> 24:36.161
Then why wasn't she fired?

24:39.491 --> 24:40.766
Your victim recanted.

24:40.835 --> 24:42.242
That's one side of the story.

24:42.307 --> 24:43.321
Give me the other side.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.183
Physical evidence
that a rape took place...

24:45.251 --> 24:47.519
and three decades of
cop instinct screaming at me.

24:47.586 --> 24:48.960
What are your
little voices saying?

24:49.027 --> 24:49.975
Coverup.

24:50.434 --> 24:53.249
Internal Affairs
is forcing Smythe to recant.

24:53.538 --> 24:57.018
The Police Department is suppressing a
crime committed against one of its own?

24:57.218 --> 24:58.146
Any idea why?

24:58.209 --> 25:00.064
That's what
we're trying to find out.

25:00.130 --> 25:02.879
I'm out of options, Counselor.
I need your juice.

25:04.449 --> 25:06.009
Let me talk
to the victim first.

25:08.482 --> 25:09.692
What are you doing here?

25:10.146 --> 25:12.055
Your neighbor told me
you were down here.

25:12.128 --> 25:14.714
Can't I get any privacy
from you people?

25:15.008 --> 25:16.918
I am here to urge you
to reconsider.

25:16.992 --> 25:18.454
You mean threaten.

25:18.529 --> 25:19.739
I mean
do the right thing.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.117
Right for who?

25:21.600 --> 25:22.648
You're a cop.

25:22.721 --> 25:24.760
I don't have to tell you
the answer to that.

25:25.344 --> 25:26.588
I'm a victim.

25:30.015 --> 25:31.739
Victims usually want justice.

25:31.807 --> 25:33.913
If you're saying now
that you were never raped...

25:33.984 --> 25:36.918
that means that you're obstructing
it and that you filed a false report.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.965
The threat surfaces.

25:39.041 --> 25:40.349
It doesn't have
to be this way.

25:40.416 --> 25:42.325
Yes, it does.

25:42.399 --> 25:43.512
Why?

25:43.583 --> 25:46.747
Because for me
it's a lose-lose situation.

25:46.815 --> 25:48.758
Please, tell me
what that means.

25:49.087 --> 25:50.974
I've lost enough already.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.460
Now, this is my choice.

25:54.495 --> 25:55.738
Don't make it my last.

26:04.702 --> 26:05.563
We're back.

26:05.631 --> 26:06.808
What's this about?

26:06.909 --> 26:07.989
You're under arrest.

26:08.061 --> 26:09.555
For what?
Loan sharking and lying.

26:09.630 --> 26:11.768
You have the right to remain
silent... What'd I lie about?

26:11.838 --> 26:14.171
Are you going to tell us who
really paid Todd Smythe's loan?

26:14.237 --> 26:15.798
I told you, his ex.

26:15.870 --> 26:18.487
In your business, one would
think you had better lying skills.

26:18.940 --> 26:19.890
Who was it?

26:19.966 --> 26:21.754
I tell you,
you gotta protect me.

26:21.820 --> 26:22.749
From who?

26:22.812 --> 26:23.762
Two cops.

26:23.836 --> 26:25.429
Two cops paid you off?

26:25.500 --> 26:27.093
Shook me down,
is more like it.

26:27.164 --> 26:28.113
How?

26:29.180 --> 26:31.417
Said I was going to forgive
Smythe's loan...

26:31.485 --> 26:32.892
and keep my mouth shut...

26:32.956 --> 26:35.990
or they'll make sure I didn't see
daylight for a quarter of a century.

26:36.059 --> 26:38.164
And you thought $50,000
was a small price to pay?

26:38.236 --> 26:39.413
Cost of doing business.

26:39.483 --> 26:40.792
What'd these two cops
look like?

26:40.859 --> 26:44.536
New suits, trench coats,
a lot of misplaced attitude.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.090
Sounds like two cheese-eating
lieutenants we know.

26:47.163 --> 26:48.440
Say anything else?

26:48.508 --> 26:49.401
Yeah.

26:49.468 --> 26:52.697
They said I could take
the loss as a tax deduction.

26:53.723 --> 26:55.152
All right. Take a walk.

26:58.011 --> 26:59.418
You're going
to have us arrested?

26:59.483 --> 27:00.944
Who the hell
do you think you are?

27:01.018 --> 27:03.440
I suggest you adjust
your tone, Lieutenant.

27:03.515 --> 27:06.547
And I suggest you adjust
your attitude, Counselor.

27:07.098 --> 27:10.001
Charging us with obstruction of
justice won't get you anywhere.

27:10.074 --> 27:11.415
It got your attention.

27:11.481 --> 27:13.969
Now that we have it,
here's the deal.

27:14.586 --> 27:16.691
You tell us why Karen Smythe
changed her story...

27:16.762 --> 27:20.177
you hand over all your case files and
notes, and we won't go through with this.

27:20.250 --> 27:21.197
You're bluffing.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.834
You think so? Try me.

27:22.906 --> 27:25.076
You're covering up the rape
of a fellow cop.

27:25.146 --> 27:26.706
You just don't get it,
do you?

27:26.776 --> 27:28.151
Read them
their rights, Captain.

27:28.217 --> 27:31.566
Do that, and a year's worth of
undercover work goes down the toilet.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.463
Who's the target
of your investigation?

27:33.529 --> 27:34.902
Do not make us tell you that.

27:34.968 --> 27:36.081
Sorry, not buying.

27:36.153 --> 27:38.487
You want to blow
both your careers, go ahead.

27:38.551 --> 27:41.650
You think the D.A.'s office doesn't
know what we're doing here, Counselor?

27:44.024 --> 27:46.991
We're not above the law, either.
I will subpoena anyone I have to.

27:47.064 --> 27:48.558
And you'll be
making a big mistake.

27:48.632 --> 27:52.243
The only mistake was trying to make a
felony disappear to protect your own case.

27:52.664 --> 27:54.190
Now that's a crime, fellas.

27:54.488 --> 27:56.178
We'll see
who's blowing their career.

27:56.247 --> 27:58.319
Are you going to tell us
what this is all about?

27:59.799 --> 28:01.206
Not without our lawyers.

28:01.623 --> 28:05.103
Fine. Bring them down to SVU tomorrow
morning when you surrender yourselves.

28:09.751 --> 28:13.045
Second month on the job,
responded to a two-year old, raped.

28:13.557 --> 28:14.605
I wanted to quit.

28:14.677 --> 28:17.395
I'm surprised it took you that
long. I was ready to go after a week.

28:17.461 --> 28:20.211
It was Karen that said that I had
talent for dealing with the victim.

28:20.277 --> 28:22.579
She said that I could turn a
negative into a positive. So...

28:22.646 --> 28:23.823
here I am.

28:23.894 --> 28:24.974
Hope you've had your coffee.

28:25.045 --> 28:25.994
Why, what's up?

28:26.070 --> 28:27.215
You got a visitor.

28:28.501 --> 28:29.647
Speak of the devil.

28:30.773 --> 28:32.301
Don't say I didn't warn you.

28:33.621 --> 28:36.173
Do I have to file a formal
complaint to stop you?

28:36.244 --> 28:39.310
How do you know we're still
investigating? IAB tell you?

28:39.379 --> 28:41.387
They paid your husband's
loan sharking debt.

28:41.460 --> 28:43.664
You never could let things go,
could you?

28:44.020 --> 28:45.231
I'm sorry?

28:45.300 --> 28:47.756
You know,
like that singer...

28:48.115 --> 28:51.377
who put a restraining order on you when
you wouldn't leave her daughter alone.

28:51.444 --> 28:54.259
You're out of line. I was
trying to protect her daughter.

28:54.612 --> 28:56.237
How do you know
about that?

28:56.820 --> 28:58.543
You better watch yourself.

28:59.379 --> 29:00.623
What's that
supposed to mean?

29:00.692 --> 29:01.902
Sounded like a threat to me.

29:01.971 --> 29:04.491
Just friendly advice. Lay off.

29:05.906 --> 29:08.972
I'm sure I'm mistaken, Sergeant,
but I thought I heard you tell...

29:09.042 --> 29:12.338
two of my detectives to ignore
a case I assigned to them.

29:12.691 --> 29:13.638
No.

29:14.163 --> 29:15.439
You're not mistaken.

29:15.505 --> 29:17.546
I guess you'll tell them
to back off, then, Captain.

29:17.618 --> 29:19.561
Because you have
your orders...

29:19.634 --> 29:20.681
don't you?

29:25.138 --> 29:27.472
She's got a pair of onions,
talking to you like that.

29:27.537 --> 29:28.649
What orders?

29:29.105 --> 29:31.789
Call just came down. We're
officially off the case.

29:31.857 --> 29:34.727
Now Smythe knew that.
What the hell's going on here?

29:35.504 --> 29:38.504
Whatever it is, it's right in
front of us and we're not seeing it.

29:39.089 --> 29:41.260
Burying the rape
buys IAB a case.

29:41.329 --> 29:42.790
But not against Karen...

29:42.865 --> 29:44.491
they tried to protect her.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.383
Which means they need her
for something.

29:46.448 --> 29:49.351
IAB investigates crooked cops.
What about the people around her?

29:50.320 --> 29:52.010
We need to revisit
the night of the rape.

29:52.079 --> 29:54.087
Right down
to the smallest detail.

30:13.263 --> 30:14.244
Can I help you?

30:14.319 --> 30:15.366
Yeah. Hey.

30:16.879 --> 30:19.749
Detective Stabler, SVU.
I'm working the Smythe case.

30:19.823 --> 30:22.539
Sergeant said she left
her address book in her car...

30:22.607 --> 30:24.548
wanted to know if I could try
and find it for her.

30:24.622 --> 30:27.109
You got the wrong car, man.
Hers is over there.

30:27.630 --> 30:28.557
Where?

30:28.622 --> 30:30.051
Over there.
Right, see over there.

30:30.125 --> 30:31.881
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Good. Thanks.

30:35.182 --> 30:36.164
You got it?

30:36.236 --> 30:38.757
Used to date a sergeant down
in Communications.

30:40.205 --> 30:42.061
Karen knew about
the restraining order.

30:42.125 --> 30:44.166
You were disciplined.
It's in your personnel file.

30:44.237 --> 30:45.611
How would she have
access to that?

30:45.677 --> 30:47.532
Maybe she read it
in your IAB file.

30:48.044 --> 30:49.157
What are you talking about?

30:49.229 --> 30:50.918
You know,
your "other" personnel file...

30:50.988 --> 30:54.534
with every infraction you ever committed
that someone secretly or not-so-secretly...

30:54.604 --> 30:56.546
ratted on you about.
Like the secret files...

30:56.621 --> 30:59.238
kept by the NYPD's
now-defunct Red Squad.

30:59.308 --> 31:00.518
Hey, Cap.

31:01.420 --> 31:03.045
I think we got something.

31:03.467 --> 31:04.416
What's up?

31:04.715 --> 31:07.912
I'm listening to radio calls from
the night of the attack on Smythe.

31:07.980 --> 31:10.663
Her driver, Murray,
called in the 10-13.

31:10.731 --> 31:14.310
Two seconds later, 3-1 Charlie
Officers Towne and Bates...

31:14.378 --> 31:16.201
call and say they're responding. Okay.

31:16.267 --> 31:18.089
24 seconds after that...

31:18.155 --> 31:21.254
they call and say they're arriving
on the scene, they need an ambulance.

31:21.323 --> 31:24.289
Bates and Towne said that they were
on meal break in their sector...

31:24.363 --> 31:26.436
when they got the call.
Ten blocks away.

31:26.506 --> 31:29.702
So, unless the radio car comes
equipped with warp drive...

31:29.771 --> 31:31.461
Or they were already there.

31:31.626 --> 31:32.738
They were.

31:32.810 --> 31:36.771
DNA on cigarette butts found in their radio
car matched the hair from the rape kit.

31:37.130 --> 31:38.242
Let's go.

31:47.913 --> 31:49.091
What are you guys doing?

31:49.161 --> 31:50.623
Put your hands
where we can see them.

31:50.697 --> 31:51.842
Mikey, they got guns out.

31:51.913 --> 31:54.466
All right, Mikey, let's see
those hands. Right there.

31:54.536 --> 31:55.585
Eat the street. Get down.

31:59.017 --> 32:00.772
Just do as they say, Austin.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.084
I see no shields.

32:02.408 --> 32:05.572
Just four pieces of crap with
guns. I got no problem shooting you.

32:06.728 --> 32:09.183
Twelve jurors or six
pallbearers, your choice.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.960
Just do what they say.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.787
Cops are coming, Bates.

32:15.111 --> 32:18.078
Who you think your friends are going
to side with when they get here?

32:23.238 --> 32:25.094
You have the right
to remain silent.

32:25.159 --> 32:27.298
I know my rights, dirtbag.

32:27.367 --> 32:29.537
Don't say a word, Mikey.
I'm not.

32:29.607 --> 32:30.883
It's all over
the radio.

32:32.039 --> 32:33.926
You better pick up Murray.
Yeah.

32:33.990 --> 32:34.972
We got it.

32:35.046 --> 32:38.395
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

32:42.021 --> 32:43.844
Murray was supposed
to watch Karen's back.

32:43.909 --> 32:45.981
It was a setup.
He had to be in on it.

32:47.494 --> 32:49.054
Where are you going
with our suspect?

32:49.125 --> 32:50.685
We're taking
our prisoner to jail.

32:50.757 --> 32:53.724
Officer Murray just confessed to his
part in the rape of Sergeant Smythe.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.969
We got another team picking up
his two accomplices.

32:56.036 --> 32:58.077
Bates and Towne? Sorry.
We just busted them.

32:59.173 --> 33:01.060
We arrest crooked cops.
Not you.

33:01.189 --> 33:02.878
We saved you the trouble,
didn't we?

33:03.205 --> 33:05.147
You guys forget
our little date this morning.

33:06.053 --> 33:07.197
And what date is that?

33:07.268 --> 33:09.090
The one where we bust you
for obstruction.

33:09.732 --> 33:11.641
Call your friend
at the D.A.'s office.

33:11.715 --> 33:14.749
If she still has her job she'll
tell you those charges were dropped.

33:14.820 --> 33:16.730
After you two guys
tried to save yourselves

33:16.803 --> 33:19.007
by arresting Murray
for raping Smythe?

33:19.076 --> 33:20.963
Officer Murray isn't being
charged with rape.

33:21.027 --> 33:22.434
What was he arrested for?

33:22.499 --> 33:24.060
Money laundering,
drug running.

33:34.402 --> 33:35.647
Drug charges?

33:36.196 --> 33:38.584
You don't have the authority
to okay the arrest of two cops.

33:38.658 --> 33:42.171
My authority is based on airtight physical
evidence that you tried to suppress.

33:42.242 --> 33:43.671
My case has priority.

33:44.227 --> 33:46.780
Nicky Farnsworth is one of the
biggest drug lords in Harlem.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.817
We couldn't nail him until we found
out that Bates, Towne, and Murray...

33:49.890 --> 33:52.158
have been guarding his shipments
for the past year and a half.

33:52.226 --> 33:54.778
Which you think gives you license
to blow my case in favor of yours?

33:54.849 --> 33:56.791
Leaving Sergeant Smythe
to take one for the company.

33:56.865 --> 33:59.996
You don't have the right to determine
the fate of a sex crime investigation.

34:00.065 --> 34:01.047
I don't answer to you.

34:01.697 --> 34:03.258
Why wasn't I at least
told about this?

34:03.329 --> 34:05.151
Need to know only.
You weren't on the list.

34:05.217 --> 34:07.127
Three police officers set up
their own sergeant...

34:07.200 --> 34:08.859
to be raped,
and probably murdered.

34:08.929 --> 34:10.489
Did that ever figure
into your crusade?

34:10.561 --> 34:11.869
Your victim's recanted.

34:11.936 --> 34:13.846
DNA evidence and
Officer Murray's testimony...

34:13.920 --> 34:15.415
should be plenty
to convince a jury.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.764
Murray's not testifying
for you.

34:16.831 --> 34:19.134
We gave him immunity in exchange
for his testimony against...

34:19.199 --> 34:20.824
Bates, Towne, and Farnsworth.

34:22.206 --> 34:23.670
You son of a bitch.

34:23.743 --> 34:24.791
A woman was raped.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.489
Look, I'm sorry
about Sergeant Smythe...

34:26.560 --> 34:28.795
but if you ask her, she'll
tell you she's on board with us.

34:28.862 --> 34:30.456
Yeah. I can tell
you're real sorry.

34:30.527 --> 34:33.047
You may have flipped Murray,
but I still have Bates and Towne.

34:33.119 --> 34:34.197
I'm not giving them up.

34:34.271 --> 34:35.994
You don't like it,
go talk to the D.A.

34:41.085 --> 34:44.565
My client wants to reiterate
that under no circumstances...

34:44.638 --> 34:46.493
will he testify
about any rape.

34:46.879 --> 34:48.056
That's the deal.

34:50.013 --> 34:52.829
Bates and Towne came to me,
said Karen was onto us...

34:52.893 --> 34:54.322
and we got to shut her up.

34:54.654 --> 34:56.378
How did they find out?

34:56.764 --> 35:00.213
A friend of Towne's saw her talking
to a known member of the rat squad.

35:00.797 --> 35:02.619
Bates said we couldn't
take a chance.

35:02.685 --> 35:03.929
Who made the plan?

35:04.477 --> 35:05.492
Bates.

35:05.565 --> 35:06.514
It was all Bates.

35:07.069 --> 35:09.306
And you hooked up
with him how?

35:10.140 --> 35:13.206
He said I can make $1,000
each time I freelanced.

35:13.502 --> 35:16.021
And so you became
a permanent employee.

35:16.733 --> 35:19.220
I got a kid that's going to
go to college in a few years.

35:19.836 --> 35:22.453
So the cash
would have been a big help.

35:23.516 --> 35:24.791
Why did you rape her?

35:26.907 --> 35:29.078
Bates said he did it
because he had to break her.

35:30.587 --> 35:33.270
He said he heard about this
garbage bag rape out in Queens...

35:33.339 --> 35:34.713
be perfect for a copycat.

35:35.259 --> 35:37.878
So they break into the
warehouse, they trip the alarm.

35:38.235 --> 35:40.952
All I got to do is park close
enough so when the call comes...

35:41.050 --> 35:42.295
we're the first to respond.

35:43.834 --> 35:46.322
And then you were going
to kill her, weren't you?

35:53.050 --> 35:54.774
My client
has nothing to say.

35:54.841 --> 35:57.263
Yeah, well, we don't need him.
We've got his DNA.

35:57.338 --> 35:59.476
We found your hair on her
from the rape kit.

35:59.546 --> 36:02.480
He was at the scene, tried to
help her. The hair proves nothing.

36:02.554 --> 36:04.758
He tried to help her
with his pants off?

36:05.657 --> 36:09.846
What's it feel like to be an errand boy
to some guy who sells dope to school kids?

36:10.586 --> 36:12.309
Truth hurts,
doesn't it, Austin?

36:12.537 --> 36:15.187
Come on, you wanted
Karen Smythe out of the way...

36:15.256 --> 36:18.323
so she wouldn't blow your second job
running drugs for Nicky Farnsworth.

36:18.392 --> 36:21.076
Badger us all you want. This'll
never see the inside of a courtroom.

36:21.145 --> 36:23.959
First degree rape, state
and federal drug charges?

36:24.985 --> 36:26.479
A judge runs
consecutive sentences,

36:26.553 --> 36:28.375
you'll probably get out
of prison in time...

36:28.440 --> 36:30.381
to see your grandchildren
flunk out of college.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.081
Smythe'll never testify.

36:32.152 --> 36:33.974
She's already talking
to the D.A.

36:37.143 --> 36:38.092
Fine.

36:38.776 --> 36:40.369
Bitch gets on the stand...

36:41.335 --> 36:43.604
the entire world
finds out she's a rat.

36:43.672 --> 36:46.420
We go down for rape,
her career goes down with us.

36:47.479 --> 36:49.454
You guys got it figured out,
don't you?

36:49.974 --> 36:52.047
Why do you think she dropped
the rape complaint?

36:52.120 --> 36:54.574
Because she's a rat
without a spine.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.818
You rape a fellow cop.
Look at you, tough guy.

36:56.885 --> 36:58.064
You're a real man,
aren't you?

36:58.135 --> 36:59.477
Get outta my face!

36:59.542 --> 37:02.260
Couldn't even face a woman
when he was raping her, huh?

37:03.093 --> 37:05.427
You had to take her
from behind in the dark.

37:06.102 --> 37:09.069
Yeah, make you feel like
a real man, errand boy?

37:25.236 --> 37:26.797
You could have told me.

37:27.508 --> 37:28.456
No...

37:29.109 --> 37:30.057
I couldn't.

37:31.860 --> 37:33.998
I don't even know
which one of them raped me.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.230
It was Bates.

37:40.883 --> 37:41.898
They set me up.

37:44.723 --> 37:47.276
How did you know they were
running drugs for Nicky Farnsworth?

37:47.347 --> 37:48.755
I overheard Murray one night.

37:48.818 --> 37:52.300
He was on the phone talking
to somebody, I don't know who.

37:52.691 --> 37:55.025
Said he had to move something
for Nicky after work.

37:55.090 --> 37:57.098
It happened
a couple more times...

37:57.170 --> 37:58.283
and I filled in the blanks.

37:58.355 --> 38:00.111
So you went to IAB because...

38:00.690 --> 38:02.348
you wanted to do
the right thing.

38:03.250 --> 38:05.422
Because I've been working
for them all along.

38:09.649 --> 38:10.762
You're a field associate.

38:11.474 --> 38:14.473
IAB came to me
when I was in the academy.

38:14.545 --> 38:15.854
Said I could make
a difference...

38:15.922 --> 38:18.059
just by keeping
my eyes and ears open.

38:19.057 --> 38:21.031
They said nobody
would ever find out.

38:21.393 --> 38:22.702
They convinced you.

38:24.177 --> 38:25.584
Didn't take convincing.

38:27.824 --> 38:29.734
I love this job, Olivia.

38:31.249 --> 38:32.972
Fifteen years...

38:33.040 --> 38:35.495
and I still believe
in what I do.

38:36.433 --> 38:39.215
And when three cops
get caught running drugs...

38:39.280 --> 38:42.444
the rest of us lose the trust
of the people we protect.

38:42.512 --> 38:44.204
So IAB told you what happened?

38:44.272 --> 38:45.450
In the hospital.

38:46.032 --> 38:49.130
Said Murray, Bates,
Towne tried to kill me.

38:49.423 --> 38:51.464
And they asked you
to recant the rape.

38:51.535 --> 38:53.674
Said if it went to trial...

38:53.742 --> 38:57.224
the defense would ask me if I was a
field associate and I'd be exposed.

38:57.647 --> 39:01.160
But I'd never have to testify
at the drug trials of these guys.

39:02.286 --> 39:04.708
D.A. is indicting
Bates and Towne for rape.

39:12.270 --> 39:14.157
And if that happens...

39:15.246 --> 39:16.588
I become a target.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.274
They raped you, Karen.

39:24.398 --> 39:26.088
And I have to live with that.

39:31.341 --> 39:32.683
Drop the charges?

39:32.748 --> 39:34.636
That's what I'm asking
you to do.

39:34.701 --> 39:37.156
I have bulletproof evidence.
It's a no-brainer for a jury.

39:37.228 --> 39:39.269
I understand that, but
if we go ahead with this,

39:39.340 --> 39:41.064
Karen Smythe's life
could be in danger.

39:41.131 --> 39:42.725
She becomes a victim
all over again.

39:42.795 --> 39:45.163
Only this time,
it's our fault.

39:45.227 --> 39:47.115
Don't ask me to let them walk on a rape.

39:47.180 --> 39:48.609
Do you think
that I want to?

39:48.684 --> 39:50.593
I would string them
up myself if I could.

39:50.668 --> 39:54.051
We all would. But it's not
about that, it's about the law.

39:55.308 --> 39:57.828
A conviction on drug charges
puts Towne and Bates...

39:57.899 --> 40:00.617
away for a lot longer than
they ever would go for the rape.

40:00.682 --> 40:02.438
That's not exactly justice,
is it?

40:03.691 --> 40:05.830
These cops took away
part of her life.

40:05.899 --> 40:08.320
Is it justice for us
to take away the rest?

40:11.883 --> 40:14.697
I will see if my bosses
will go for it. I'll just...

40:14.762 --> 40:16.256
tell them to do the math.

40:29.322 --> 40:30.270
Hey...

40:31.082 --> 40:32.390
you following me now?

40:32.457 --> 40:34.847
A cop should know where
his partner has breakfast.

40:35.402 --> 40:38.597
Listen, you took a chance
going through that radio car.

40:38.665 --> 40:39.745
Thanks.

40:42.376 --> 40:43.806
Praise makes me hungry.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.535
Got your appetite back.

40:45.608 --> 40:47.431
Feels good to eat like
a human being again.

40:47.496 --> 40:48.511
You get your test results?

40:48.584 --> 40:50.144
Clean bill of health.

40:50.247 --> 40:51.676
Negative for HIV...

40:51.753 --> 40:52.701
hepatitis.

40:53.800 --> 40:54.748
Salute.
