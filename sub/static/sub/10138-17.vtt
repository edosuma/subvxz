WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:03.671
Okay, gentlemen.

00:03.712 --> 00:05.798
Now, you cut along

00:03.712 --> 00:05.798
the dotted line there.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.591
'Good boy. Very good.'

00:07.633 --> 00:09.635
And when you guys are finished

00:07.633 --> 00:09.635
cutting on the line

00:09.677 --> 00:11.345
we're gonna open it up

00:09.677 --> 00:11.345

00:11.386 --> 00:14.849
a very groovy, Valentine's day

00:11.386 --> 00:14.849
present for your mother.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.184
This I gotta see.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.145
Hey, wasn't I right

00:18.686 --> 00:20.145
about the cauliflower

00:20.187 --> 00:21.814
tasting good if

00:20.187 --> 00:21.814
you plug your nose, huh?

00:21.856 --> 00:23.941
Remember that, remember

00:21.856 --> 00:23.941
when we went like that?

00:23.983 --> 00:25.776
Now, open it up.

00:25.818 --> 00:28.153
You're smart, daddy.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.114

00:29.279 --> 00:31.114

Authority figures!

02:11.423 --> 02:13.550
Okay, class

02:13.592 --> 02:15.844
let's settle down.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.139
You all know Mr. Gladstone

02:19.180 --> 02:21.349
and Mrs. Carruthers

02:19.180 --> 02:21.349
from the PTA.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.561
and they have a very,

02:21.391 --> 02:24.561
special announcement to make.

02:24.603 --> 02:25.854
We're getting married.

02:27.355 --> 02:28.649
No, just kidding.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.442
Uh, the real announcement

02:30.484 --> 02:33.612
is that during this year's

02:30.484 --> 02:33.612
PTA fund-raiser drive

02:33.654 --> 02:36.197
your class

02:33.654 --> 02:36.197
sold more candy bars

02:36.239 --> 02:38.533
than any other class

02:36.239 --> 02:38.533
in the entire school.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.328
(together)

02:38.575 --> 02:41.328
Yay!

02:41.369 --> 02:43.371
And a special thanks

02:41.369 --> 02:43.371
to Michelle

02:43.413 --> 02:45.290
for selling

02:43.413 --> 02:45.290
the most candy bars.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.875
And a special thanks

02:45.332 --> 02:46.875
to Joey

02:46.917 --> 02:48.961
for eating

02:46.917 --> 02:48.961
the most candy bars.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.171
Well, it was an honor

02:50.211 --> 02:52.171
to get so bloated

02:52.213 --> 02:54.800
for such

02:52.213 --> 02:54.800
a worthy cause.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.468
And because of all

02:54.842 --> 02:56.468
your hard work

02:56.510 --> 02:57.845
the PTA is throwing you

02:57.886 --> 03:00.639
a special

02:57.886 --> 03:00.639
Valentine's day party.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.307
(all)

03:00.681 --> 03:02.307
Yay!

03:02.349 --> 03:05.727
Okay, let's break into

03:02.349 --> 03:05.727
our reading groups.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.484
I hope you can make it

03:10.440 --> 03:12.484
to the party, Mr. Gladstone.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.402
Oh, I'll be there

03:12.526 --> 03:14.402
with pants on.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.279
I hope so.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.906
And, uh, please,

03:16.321 --> 03:17.906
call me Joey.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.783
Okay, Joey.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.785
[clears throat]

03:19.825 --> 03:21.785
Excuse me.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.580
Joey, we best be

03:23.787 --> 03:25.580
on our way.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.832
Well, uh, after you.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.291
Oh, no. After you.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.003
Buns before beauty.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.003
Ha!

03:31.045 --> 03:32.587
- Ha!.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.386
A party

03:37.843 --> 03:39.386
in our classroom

03:39.427 --> 03:41.972
It's gonna be like MTV

03:39.427 --> 03:41.972
with a milk break.

03:42.014 --> 03:45.059
Yeah, and since

03:42.014 --> 03:45.059
it's a Valentine's party

03:45.100 --> 03:46.852
we should

03:45.100 --> 03:46.852
all have dates.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.103
Right, girls?

03:48.145 --> 03:49.312
- Right.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.106
Right, guys?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.232
Well...

03:52.273 --> 03:53.817
- I don't know.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.817
- Do we have to?

03:53.859 --> 03:55.318
I said, right?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.529
- Yeah! Okay.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.529
- Yeah! Yeah! Great idea!

03:58.321 --> 03:59.948
Okay, Derek's mine.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.077
I love these aggressive women

03:59.990 --> 04:03.077
of the nineties.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.787
Michelle, you'll be with Teddy.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.039
(both)

04:05.829 --> 04:07.039
Cool!

04:07.081 --> 04:08.916
And Aaron, you'll be

04:07.081 --> 04:08.916
with Sophia.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.462
Don't wear

04:12.335 --> 04:14.462
anything trampy.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.926
Now that we each have

04:16.423 --> 04:18.926
a boyfriend or girlfriend

04:18.967 --> 04:20.594
now, we gotta

04:18.967 --> 04:20.594
sit by 'em.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.180
Do I<i> have</i> to sit

04:20.635 --> 04:23.180
next to<i> him?</i>

04:23.222 --> 04:25.724
Yes. You're in

04:23.222 --> 04:25.724
a relationship.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.519
Come on, Derek.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.315
I never had

04:32.773 --> 04:34.315
a boyfriend before.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.984
What should we

04:34.357 --> 04:35.984
do now?

04:36.026 --> 04:37.778
Well, my sister

04:36.026 --> 04:37.778
has a boyfriend

04:37.819 --> 04:40.488
and all she ever does

04:37.819 --> 04:40.488
is write his name

04:40.530 --> 04:42.323
over and over again.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.034
We can do that.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.034
What's his name?

04:44.076 --> 04:46.245
Lenny.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.038
(all together)

04:46.286 --> 04:48.038
L..

04:48.080 --> 04:49.414
(all together)

04:48.080 --> 04:49.414
...e..

04:49.456 --> 04:50.791
(all together)

04:49.456 --> 04:50.791
...n..

04:50.832 --> 04:52.626
(all together)

04:50.832 --> 04:52.626
...n..

04:52.667 --> 04:54.419
(all together)

04:52.667 --> 04:54.419
...y.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.379
(all together)

04:54.461 --> 04:56.379
L...

04:57.714 --> 05:00.217
Mm. That is a good

04:57.714 --> 05:00.217
pastrami sandwich

05:00.259 --> 05:03.011
but it needs

05:00.259 --> 05:03.011
a li'l more mustard.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.889
It's salmon.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.808
Oh, then it's just right.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.808
It's good.

05:08.892 --> 05:09.977
Hey, guys.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.061
(Jesse)

05:10.018 --> 05:11.061
Hey.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.187
I just spoke to Claire.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.481
I got my big Valentine's day

05:12.229 --> 05:14.481
all set.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.608
Oh, yeah?

05:14.522 --> 05:16.608
What's the plan, Stan?

05:16.650 --> 05:20.154
Well, here's what

05:16.650 --> 05:20.154
I'm thinkin', Lincoln.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.404
Roses, candy

05:21.446 --> 05:23.240
and-and maybe dinner

05:21.446 --> 05:23.240
in a nice restaurant.

05:23.282 --> 05:24.908
Danny, this is your first

05:23.282 --> 05:24.908
Valentine's day with Claire

05:24.950 --> 05:26.660
You gotta do something

05:24.950 --> 05:26.660
real special for her.

05:26.701 --> 05:27.869
Uh, you have

05:26.701 --> 05:27.869
a better idea?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.165
Yes. As a matter

05:29.246 --> 05:31.165
of fact, I do.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.707
I happen to be

05:31.206 --> 05:32.707
the king of

05:32.749 --> 05:35.085
comin' up with great

05:32.749 --> 05:35.085
romantic Valentine dates.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.253
For instance, Beck,

05:35.127 --> 05:36.253
remember that

05:36.295 --> 05:37.545
remember that time we, uh

05:37.587 --> 05:38.839
remember that time we had

05:37.587 --> 05:38.839
that moonlit

05:38.880 --> 05:40.090
picnic overlooking

05:38.880 --> 05:40.090
the ocean?

05:40.132 --> 05:41.800
Oh, that was beautiful.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.384
Yeah. And how about

05:43.426 --> 05:45.220
How about the time when I got

05:43.426 --> 05:45.220
that bed and breakfast

05:45.262 --> 05:48.223
and I-and I decked up

05:45.262 --> 05:48.223
the whole room with red roses?

05:48.265 --> 05:49.308
That was unforgettable.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.018
Yeah, and

05:51.059 --> 05:54.229
how about walking hand in hand

05:51.059 --> 05:54.229
on The Golden Gate bridge..

05:54.271 --> 05:56.606
...glass of champagne.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.441
That wasn't me.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.325
It was Joey.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.325
That's what it was.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.909
It was Joey. I remember.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.703
Because we were walking,

06:07.951 --> 06:09.703
he looked down, he got scared.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.079
He said, "Jess, hold my hand."

06:11.121 --> 06:13.165
I held his hand,

06:11.121 --> 06:13.165
he said, "I'm thirsty--"

06:13.207 --> 06:16.126
Jess, can it!

06:16.168 --> 06:17.878
Well, he might have

06:16.168 --> 06:17.878
a lousy memory

06:17.919 --> 06:20.421
but he does come up with some

06:17.919 --> 06:20.421
pretty romantic evenings.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.841
Go ahead, honey. Tell him what

06:20.463 --> 06:22.841
you've planned for us this year.

06:25.344 --> 06:26.970
Uh, well...like I

06:25.344 --> 06:26.970
was thinking

06:27.012 --> 06:28.847
at this stage

06:27.012 --> 06:28.847
in our marriage

06:28.889 --> 06:31.725
that w-we don't need to do

06:28.889 --> 06:31.725
some kind of special thing

06:31.766 --> 06:33.977
to prove our love

06:31.766 --> 06:33.977
to each other.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.687
We don't?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.231
No, now, Danny,

06:35.729 --> 06:37.231
for instance

06:37.272 --> 06:39.816
see-see, he-he's just starting

06:37.272 --> 06:39.816
to date Claire.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.985
This is all new for him.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.985
So, he's got to woo her.

06:42.027 --> 06:46.073
We, on the other hand,

06:42.027 --> 06:46.073
we-we're pretty much wooed out.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.075
Well, no, there's

06:46.114 --> 06:48.075
always woom for woo.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.245
I mean, room

06:48.116 --> 06:51.245
for roo-woo.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.330
I mean, look at this, you made

06:51.286 --> 06:53.330
me a sandwich, okay?

06:53.372 --> 06:54.831
Nothing says love like

06:54.873 --> 06:57.792
a piece of cold fish

06:54.873 --> 06:57.792
between two slices of bread.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.673
Guess what? We're having

07:01.004 --> 07:03.673
a party at our class tomorrow.

07:03.715 --> 07:04.966
I'm going

07:03.715 --> 07:04.966
with Teddy.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.676
He's my boyfriend.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.595
Michelle, I'm

07:06.718 --> 07:08.595
very happy for you.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.389
How'd you guys

07:08.636 --> 07:10.389
get together?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.766
I don't know.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.766
It happened so fast.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.434
One minute,

07:12.807 --> 07:14.434
I'm thumb-wrestling.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.062
The next thing I know,

07:14.475 --> 07:17.062
I'm out of circulation.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.607
Thanks for walking

07:18.772 --> 07:20.607
me home, Kenneth.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.733
You're welcome, Steph.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.526
Boy, I wish you weren't

07:21.775 --> 07:23.526
so smart.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.779
All these books

07:23.568 --> 07:25.779
are heavy.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.488
Well, actually,

07:25.820 --> 07:27.488
they're not books.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.907
I had to bring in

07:27.530 --> 07:28.907
my rock collection

07:28.949 --> 07:31.743
for my

07:28.949 --> 07:31.743
earth science class.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.578
But you must be

07:31.785 --> 07:33.578
pretty strong to carry 'em

07:33.620 --> 07:35.247
all the way from school.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.497
Uh, thanks.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.751
You know, I've been

07:36.539 --> 07:39.751
working out a little.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.128
I can tell.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.546
You know, Steph,

07:41.169 --> 07:43.546
you have beautiful hair.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.090
Oh, thanks.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.716
I raised it

07:45.132 --> 07:46.716
from peach fuzz.

07:47.759 --> 07:48.760
I'll call you tonight.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.221
I'll be waiting.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.318
Do boyfriends

08:02.690 --> 08:04.318
and girlfriends

08:04.359 --> 08:06.903
always act so stupid?

08:06.945 --> 08:08.989
Oh, they're

08:06.945 --> 08:08.989
just warming up.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.711
Comfy?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.465
Okay, Michelle, get ready.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.216
There's no way you can

08:26.506 --> 08:28.216
defeat

08:28.258 --> 08:30.760
the thumb-master!

08:30.802 --> 08:32.387
Teddy, I'm your girlfriend.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.597
We can't thumb-wrestle

08:32.429 --> 08:34.597
anymore.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.932
We can hold hands

08:35.974 --> 08:38.435
but we've got to keep

08:35.974 --> 08:38.435
our thumbs still.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.401
Okay, what's next?

08:47.319 --> 08:48.820
Well, you could..

08:48.862 --> 08:50.322
...look into my eyes

08:50.364 --> 08:52.032
and say something

08:50.364 --> 08:52.032
sweet about me.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.616
Okay.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.289
You have a nice head.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.127
Thank you. Nice heads

09:01.458 --> 09:04.127
run in my family.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.589
Noses run in my family.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.589
Get it?

09:11.592 --> 09:14.262
Teddy, you're

09:11.592 --> 09:14.262
ruining the mood.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.597
Sorry.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.683
Now what do we do?

09:18.725 --> 09:21.102
I think we're

09:18.725 --> 09:21.102
supposed to kiss.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.441
(both together)

09:24.105 --> 09:26.441
Nah!

09:26.483 --> 09:28.902
I know what you can do.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.902
You can call me.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.487
Call you what?

09:31.488 --> 09:33.990
No. Go home

09:31.488 --> 09:33.990
and call me.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.284
Oh, okay.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.286
I'm glad you know

09:36.326 --> 09:38.286
what to do.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.584
[door-bell rings]

09:44.625 --> 09:46.044
Teddy?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.505
Uh, Michelle,

09:46.086 --> 09:48.505
that was the door.

09:48.547 --> 09:51.049
Sorry. I got

09:48.547 --> 09:51.049
my bells mixed up.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.718
Oh, hi.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.718
Can I help you?

09:53.760 --> 09:56.096
Yeah. You-You

09:53.760 --> 09:56.096
Joey Gladstone?

09:56.137 --> 09:58.014
That's what it says

09:56.137 --> 09:58.014
on my underpants.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.017
Right.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.018
Well, this is for you.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.272
Whoa, look at this.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.565
That's incredible.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.733
What did I do

10:06.606 --> 10:08.733
to deserve all this?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.152
It's just what

10:08.775 --> 10:11.152
I was thinking.

10:11.194 --> 10:14.197
Have a nice day.

10:11.194 --> 10:14.197
Goodbye. Thank you.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.615
Joey, who's it from?

10:15.656 --> 10:16.991
I see, there's a card

10:15.656 --> 10:16.991
right here.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.410
It says, uh

10:18.452 --> 10:19.411
"To Joey

10:19.453 --> 10:20.954
"You put a smile

10:19.453 --> 10:20.954
in my heart

10:20.995 --> 10:23.457
"and a butterfly

10:20.995 --> 10:23.457
in my stomach.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.084
From your secret admirer."

10:28.795 --> 10:31.131
Wow, I bet it's

10:28.795 --> 10:31.131
Mrs. Carruthers.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.757
She has her eye on you.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.928
That's the only part of her

10:34.217 --> 10:36.928
she hasn't had on me.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.140
[telephone ringing]

10:40.181 --> 10:41.308
Hello.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.518
Hi, Teddy.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.518
Wanna come over?

10:44.852 --> 10:46.938
So? Come over again.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.774
Yes. You have to.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.486
And can you bring

10:49.816 --> 10:52.486
some candy and flowers?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.530
'cause it's romantic.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.077
I've got to tell him

10:58.241 --> 11:01.077
everything.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.080
Alright, picture this.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.873
A yacht on the bay.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.417
String quartet.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.835
Caviar, champagne.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.837
A vase..

11:10.878 --> 11:12.464
...with a single rose.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.093
- Oh, Jess.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.093
- Thanks, buddy!

11:17.135 --> 11:18.219
Alright! Claire's gonna

11:17.135 --> 11:18.219
remember this night

11:18.261 --> 11:19.804
for the rest of her life.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.431
- Claire?

11:19.846 --> 11:21.431
- Yeah, Yeah.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.474
I worked all day setting this

11:21.473 --> 11:22.474
thing up for you.

11:22.516 --> 11:23.808
Oh, you're gonna

11:22.516 --> 11:23.808
be so happy.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.893
Is he the king

11:23.850 --> 11:25.893
of romance, or what?

11:25.935 --> 11:28.229
Oh, he's

11:25.935 --> 11:28.229
a royal something.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.064
Come here.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.065
Now, I think you

11:30.106 --> 11:31.065
should wear a tuxedo.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.400
'Tuxedo?'

11:43.370 --> 11:44.996
What stinks?

11:45.788 --> 11:47.081
It's my new perfume.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.583
I borrowed it

11:47.123 --> 11:48.583
from Steph.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.794
It's called

11:48.625 --> 11:51.794
"A night in Paris."

11:51.836 --> 11:54.548
Whoa. I'm never going

11:51.836 --> 11:54.548
there after dark.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.134
Did you bring

11:55.798 --> 11:58.134
the candy and flowers?

11:58.176 --> 11:59.886
Can't we just

11:58.176 --> 11:59.886
thumb-wrestle?

11:59.927 --> 12:03.223
I told you, boyfriends

11:59.927 --> 12:03.223
and girlfriends don't do that.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.559
Well, can't we draw

12:03.264 --> 12:05.559
or watch cartoons

12:05.600 --> 12:07.060
or do something fun?

12:07.101 --> 12:09.896
Um, here. You can

12:07.101 --> 12:09.896
carry my books.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.316
And the fun part

12:11.314 --> 12:13.316
would be?

12:13.358 --> 12:15.485
Look, I don't make

12:13.358 --> 12:15.485
the rules.

12:15.527 --> 12:18.279
That's just what boyfriends

12:15.527 --> 12:18.279
are supposed to do.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.448
Being a boyfriend

12:18.321 --> 12:20.448
is a bad job.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.159
Well, that's because

12:20.490 --> 12:23.159
you've got a bad attitude.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.954
This is nuts!

12:24.452 --> 12:26.954
I'm breaking up.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.957
You can't. We have to stay

12:26.996 --> 12:29.957
together for the kids.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.253
We don't

12:31.376 --> 12:33.253
even have kids.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.753
The kids

12:33.294 --> 12:34.753
at the party.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.298
We'll be the only ones

12:34.795 --> 12:37.298
there without dates.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.133
Who cares?

12:39.175 --> 12:41.636
I gave you the best day

12:39.175 --> 12:41.636
of my life.

12:55.358 --> 12:58.027
Hey, Michelle, tell Steph

12:55.358 --> 12:58.027
I returned her flannel.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.321
Hey, Twerperella,

12:58.069 --> 13:00.321
you look awful.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.658
Teddy and I just broke up.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.909
Who cares?

13:04.951 --> 13:06.869
I was just making

13:04.951 --> 13:06.869
an observation.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.079
Kimmy.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.081
I'm sorry, Michelle.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.750
DJ, can you help me?

13:11.790 --> 13:15.629
Guys are always

13:11.790 --> 13:15.629
breaking up with you.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.381
Excuse me, but guys

13:15.670 --> 13:18.381
don't break up with me.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.676
<i>I</i> break up with<i> them.</i>

13:21.718 --> 13:23.595
Either way, you're alone

13:21.718 --> 13:23.595
on Saturday night

13:23.637 --> 13:26.139
watching "The Commish."

13:26.180 --> 13:27.557
True.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.016
Hey, girls.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.016
Dinner's ready.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.851
I'm not hungry.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.061
Why, honey?

13:30.893 --> 13:32.061
What's wrong?

13:32.103 --> 13:34.606
Teddy gave her

13:32.103 --> 13:34.606
the old heave-ho.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.524
Oh, that's too bad, Michelle.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.234
You must feel awful.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.278
But you know what,

13:38.276 --> 13:40.278
you're only in the third grade.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.281
Believe me, you'll have plenty

13:40.320 --> 13:43.281
of time for boyfriends.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.409
But now, I don't have a date

13:43.323 --> 13:46.409
for the Valentine's party.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.036
Just do what any woman in

13:46.451 --> 13:49.036
your position would do..

13:49.078 --> 13:51.372
...key his bike.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.793
It was so nice

13:51.414 --> 13:54.793
the first five minutes.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.796
Yeah. The first five minutes

13:54.833 --> 13:57.796
are always the easiest.

13:57.836 --> 14:00.423
And then it's their turn

13:57.836 --> 14:00.423
to talk.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.009
Girls, all guys

14:00.465 --> 14:03.009
are not the same.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.427
I'm sure, in the beginning

14:04.469 --> 14:06.012
they're a little

14:04.469 --> 14:06.012
more romantic.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.640
The flowers, the caviar

14:08.682 --> 14:11.184
the moonlight picnics.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.769
And then one day,

14:11.225 --> 14:12.769
you turn around

14:12.811 --> 14:14.729
and...there he is

14:14.771 --> 14:18.024
chomping on

14:14.771 --> 14:18.024
a big ol' fish sandwich.

14:18.065 --> 14:21.194
That's when you realize

14:18.065 --> 14:21.194
he'd rather chew than woo.

14:22.696 --> 14:23.780
Men.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.990
They won't bring

14:23.822 --> 14:25.990
you flowers.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.826
They won't make

14:26.032 --> 14:27.826
a commitment.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.703
They won't squat

14:27.867 --> 14:29.703
in Jell-O for you.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.248
Don't knock it

14:32.455 --> 14:34.248
till you've tried it.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.378
Boy, do we sound awful.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.630
Yeah. Guys

14:38.419 --> 14:40.630
aren't that bad.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.465
Yeah, from now on

14:42.507 --> 14:43.842
no more men-bashing.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.637
I can't believe that

14:46.052 --> 14:47.637
Kenneth hasn't called.

14:47.679 --> 14:51.015
If a guy says he's gonna call,

14:47.679 --> 14:51.015
he should call.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.100
I should've carried

14:51.057 --> 14:53.100
my own rocks.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.395
I mean, they weren't even

14:53.142 --> 14:55.395
that heavy.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.856
Okay, maybe a little

14:55.436 --> 14:57.856
more bashing.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.859
[chattering]

15:07.948 --> 15:10.744
More flowers and candy?

15:10.785 --> 15:14.581
Boy, Mrs. Carruthers must like

15:10.785 --> 15:14.581
her men fat and fragrant.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.833
Well, she picked

15:14.622 --> 15:16.833
the right guy.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.084
Oh, go on.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.669
I gotta put a stop to this.

15:19.711 --> 15:22.213
Jess, how do I

15:19.711 --> 15:22.213
turn a woman off?

15:22.255 --> 15:25.091
Show her your bank account

15:22.255 --> 15:25.091
and driver's license picture.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.342
That might work.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.012
Well..

15:30.054 --> 15:31.723
...well..

15:31.765 --> 15:33.808
...so, how do I look?

15:33.850 --> 15:35.894
Like you're going hiking

15:33.850 --> 15:35.894
with James Bond.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.314
Hey, you're goin'

15:38.855 --> 15:40.314
on a boat ride.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.691
What's with

15:40.356 --> 15:41.691
the pack, Jack?

15:41.733 --> 15:43.984
Hey, take it easy,

15:41.733 --> 15:43.984
greasy.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.612
I'm just being

15:44.026 --> 15:45.612
prepared, Jess.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.572
I've got everything.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.572
I've got my shark repellent.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.324
Yeah, I got the,

15:47.614 --> 15:50.324
oh, signal flares.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.659
And these are good

15:50.366 --> 15:51.659
to have around

15:51.701 --> 15:52.786
seasick patches.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.078
Hmm, Nothing

15:52.827 --> 15:54.078
says romance

15:54.120 --> 15:56.664
like an anti-vomit tag

15:54.120 --> 15:56.664
behind your ear.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.583
I don't know,

15:56.706 --> 15:58.583
I feel bad.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.460
I appreciate everything

15:58.625 --> 16:00.460
you've done.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.587
You spent so much time setting

16:00.501 --> 16:02.587
up this Valentine's date for me

16:02.629 --> 16:04.464
you didn't have time

16:02.629 --> 16:04.464
to plan one for yourself.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.840
Oh, don't worry

16:04.505 --> 16:05.840
about us.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.550
We're just

16:05.882 --> 16:07.550
an old married couple.

16:07.592 --> 16:08.968
Give us the remote

16:09.009 --> 16:10.678
nice old rerun

16:09.009 --> 16:10.678
of an Elvis movie

16:10.720 --> 16:12.597
a clear path

16:10.720 --> 16:12.597
to the bathroom

16:12.639 --> 16:13.890
and we're as happy

16:12.639 --> 16:13.890
as two raccoons

16:13.932 --> 16:15.224
in a Denny's dumpster.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.270
Raccoons

16:17.351 --> 16:19.270
in a dumpster?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.648
Denny's.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.691
Is that how

16:21.689 --> 16:23.691
you see us?

16:23.733 --> 16:26.986
I can't believe that you've

16:23.733 --> 16:26.986
lost every bit of romance.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.405
I mean, you've gone from

16:27.027 --> 16:29.405
Mr. Excitement to Mr. Rogers.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.869
Is it me or does

16:31.950 --> 16:34.869
she seem a tad cranky?

16:34.911 --> 16:36.663
A tad and a half,

16:34.911 --> 16:36.663
I'd say.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.749
You know what she needs?

16:39.791 --> 16:41.041
Some fresh air.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.084
'No, I do not. Come on'

16:42.126 --> 16:43.670
Just step outside.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.672
- I don't need any fresh air.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.672
- It's good fresh air.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.214
- It's special fresh air.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.214
- I don't want any fresh air.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.092
Jess, I don't understand why do

16:47.256 --> 16:50.092
I have to go outside..

16:50.134 --> 16:51.886
What the heck?

16:51.928 --> 16:53.972
You know, I was thinking, Beck

16:51.928 --> 16:53.972
wouldn't it be romantic

16:54.013 --> 16:56.056
to take a nice

16:54.013 --> 16:56.056
hot-air balloon ride

16:56.098 --> 16:58.142
over the wine country, you know?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.142
We can ha..

16:58.184 --> 17:00.895
Oh, look,

16:58.184 --> 17:00.895
here's one now.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.480
And isn't it amazingly

17:00.937 --> 17:02.480
convenient?

17:02.522 --> 17:03.898
Your luggage is all packed

17:03.940 --> 17:05.984
and a beautiful picnic's

17:03.940 --> 17:05.984
already been prepared.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.151
Here you are, sir.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.695
By the way, is this

17:07.193 --> 17:08.695
neighborhood

17:08.736 --> 17:11.071
zoned for hot-air balloons?

17:08.736 --> 17:11.071
You have any idea?

17:11.113 --> 17:13.157
You guys set me up.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.034
Big time.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.369
Hop in.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.956
Beck, did you think that

17:17.912 --> 17:19.956
I'd really forget

17:19.998 --> 17:21.541
Valentine's day, honey?

17:21.582 --> 17:22.583
I mean, com..

17:22.625 --> 17:23.793
Oh, hey, look. What's this?

17:23.835 --> 17:26.671
Champagne and some

17:23.835 --> 17:26.671
beautiful red roses.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.172
Ohh. I don't know.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.174
All that talk about

17:28.214 --> 17:30.174
being an old married couple

17:30.216 --> 17:33.093
I was, I was afraid we were

17:30.216 --> 17:33.093
really wooed out.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.930
Oh, honey, you're

17:33.135 --> 17:35.930
so wong-wrong.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.974
No, that's never

17:35.972 --> 17:37.974
gonna happen.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.476
Let me tell you something,

17:38.016 --> 17:40.476
every day I wake up

17:40.518 --> 17:42.687
and look at you

17:40.518 --> 17:42.687
next to me

17:42.729 --> 17:45.356
I fall in love with you

17:42.729 --> 17:45.356
all over again.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.359
Aw, Jess.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.486
You are still

17:48.401 --> 17:50.486
the king of romance.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.947
Yes, long live the king.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.661
Up, James

17:56.325 --> 17:58.661
and cover your eyes.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.997
All right. Bye-bye.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.624
You guys have a magical,

18:01.039 --> 18:03.624
wonderful time.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.709
While you're up there,

18:03.666 --> 18:04.709
could you

18:04.751 --> 18:06.627
could you check

18:04.751 --> 18:06.627
my rain gutters?

18:20.641 --> 18:22.685
I heard you and

18:20.641 --> 18:22.685
Teddy split up.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.270
Did he break

18:22.727 --> 18:24.270
your heart?

18:24.311 --> 18:28.274
Nah. I thought so, but it

18:24.311 --> 18:28.274
turned out to be just gas.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.778
Well, sorry

18:30.026 --> 18:31.778
it's over.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.029
Me, too.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.073
I'm the only one here

18:33.071 --> 18:35.073
without a date.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.449
You're so lucky.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.118
Yeah. It's nice to be

18:36.490 --> 18:39.118
here with someone.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.290
Alright, everyone.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.290
We have the music.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.751
Now, we need

18:44.331 --> 18:46.751
some dancers.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.465
Oh, it's not gonna be much

18:49.545 --> 18:52.465
of a party if nobody dances.

18:54.092 --> 18:57.011
I've got an idea. Why don't

18:54.092 --> 18:57.011
we make this ladies' choice?

18:57.053 --> 19:00.723
Uh, girls, you can ask

18:57.053 --> 19:00.723
the gentlemen to dance.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.684
And, uh, why don't you work

19:00.765 --> 19:03.684
your feminine charms

19:03.726 --> 19:06.020
on the man of your choice.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.273
And any guy who says no

19:06.062 --> 19:09.273
gets a wedgie.

19:09.315 --> 19:12.110
[instrumental music]

19:18.574 --> 19:20.367
Joey, would you

19:18.574 --> 19:20.367
like to dance

19:20.409 --> 19:22.078
or would you like

19:20.409 --> 19:22.078
a wedgie?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.204
Either way,

19:22.120 --> 19:24.204
I can't lose.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.917
Well, either way,

19:24.246 --> 19:27.917
I can, Mrs. Carruthers.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.418
Mrs. Carruthers,

19:27.959 --> 19:29.418
there's something

19:29.460 --> 19:31.253
I'd like to settle

19:29.460 --> 19:31.253
with you, okay.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.713
I know what

19:31.295 --> 19:32.713
you're gonna say

19:32.755 --> 19:35.675
but, uh. I've got to give

19:32.755 --> 19:35.675
this stuff to you.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.176
Ohh!

19:37.217 --> 19:38.761
I've got the rest of the stuff

19:37.217 --> 19:38.761
out in the car

19:38.803 --> 19:40.888
including

19:38.803 --> 19:40.888
the chocolate cupid

19:40.930 --> 19:44.725
although I did nibble a few

19:40.930 --> 19:44.725
arrows out of the quiver.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.769
Oh, my little

19:44.767 --> 19:46.769
Duncan Hiney.

19:46.811 --> 19:50.023
Boy, that I had something

19:46.811 --> 19:50.023
to give you in return.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.358
What am I saying?

19:50.064 --> 19:52.358
I do.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.609
Say ahh!

19:53.651 --> 19:56.570
Oh, Mrs. Carruthers,

19:53.651 --> 19:56.570
wait a second.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.072
You didn't give me

19:56.612 --> 19:58.072
all this stuff?

19:58.114 --> 20:01.075
No, you

19:58.114 --> 20:01.075
silly-willy billy.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.994
- You mean someone else did?

20:01.117 --> 20:02.994
- Mm-hmm.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.622
Did I just see,

20:04.537 --> 20:06.622
o-out in the hallway

20:06.664 --> 20:08.041
Willard Scott in a thong?

20:08.082 --> 20:10.793
Oh, I love him.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.793
Willard!

20:10.835 --> 20:12.252
Willard!

20:15.882 --> 20:18.342
I didn't know you and

20:15.882 --> 20:18.342
Mrs. Carruthers were an item.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.845
Oh, yeah,

20:18.384 --> 20:20.845
I'm an item alright.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.221
I'm a grand-slam breakfast

20:22.262 --> 20:24.515
and she's a hungry trucker.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.266
Joey..

20:26.308 --> 20:29.353
...I was the one that who sent

20:26.308 --> 20:29.353
you the flowers and the candy.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.897
Really, it was you,

20:29.395 --> 20:30.897
Ms. Ullman?

20:30.938 --> 20:32.899
Oh, please, call me Cindy.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.942
I was hoping it would

20:32.940 --> 20:34.942
be sort of an ice-breaker.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.028
I thought you'd figure out

20:34.984 --> 20:37.028
it was me.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.362
Well, I didn't.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.990
But I'm sure I'm glad

20:38.404 --> 20:40.990
it worked out that way.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.617
<i>That</i> wasn't Willard!

20:43.659 --> 20:45.619
Cindy, if you're

20:43.659 --> 20:45.619
not busy sometime

20:45.661 --> 20:46.746
I thought that..

20:46.787 --> 20:48.164
[instrumental music]

20:48.206 --> 20:52.043
Come here, my little

20:48.206 --> 20:52.043
fiesta platter.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.544
Lambada!

20:53.586 --> 20:54.921
Oh, God, no.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.931
Cindy, look, I don't

21:03.262 --> 21:04.931
have much time.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.140
Would you like

21:04.972 --> 21:06.140
to go out with me?

21:06.182 --> 21:07.850
Oh, I'd love to.

21:07.892 --> 21:10.310
Great. I'll-I'll call

21:07.892 --> 21:10.310
you...on-on Friday.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.730
- Joey!

21:10.352 --> 21:12.730
- From Guam.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.525
<i>Ole!</i>

21:21.948 --> 21:23.199
You can have it.

21:23.241 --> 21:25.785
That's okay,

21:23.241 --> 21:25.785
I've already had six.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.286
You've got a lot

21:25.826 --> 21:27.286
of time to eat

21:27.327 --> 21:29.705
when you have

21:27.327 --> 21:29.705
no one to dance with.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.707
Pretty crummy party, huh?

21:31.749 --> 21:34.085
Yeah, when we were

21:31.749 --> 21:34.085
just friends

21:34.127 --> 21:36.754
these parties

21:34.127 --> 21:36.754
were totally fun.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.214
Remember

21:36.796 --> 21:38.214
last Thanksgiving

21:38.256 --> 21:40.591
when Derek dressed up

21:38.256 --> 21:40.591
like a turkey?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.052
Yeah, and Aaron and I

21:40.633 --> 21:43.052
grabbed him by the legs

21:43.094 --> 21:44.720
and tried

21:43.094 --> 21:44.720
to make a wish.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.348
I think being boyfriend

21:46.555 --> 21:48.348
and girlfriend

21:48.390 --> 21:49.809
has too many rules.

21:49.850 --> 21:53.020
Me, too. I wish we could

21:49.850 --> 21:53.020
just be friends again.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.606
Who says we can't?

21:53.062 --> 21:55.606
Let's shake on it.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.484
Thumb-wrestle.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.484
Ding! Gotcha!

21:58.525 --> 22:00.360
Cheater.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.360
I wasn't ready.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.862
Ready to dance?

22:01.904 --> 22:03.697
Are friends

22:01.904 --> 22:03.697
allowed to dance?

22:03.739 --> 22:06.075
Friends don't have rules.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.075
They just have fun.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.451
If we gotta dance

22:07.493 --> 22:10.288
we might as well blow

22:07.493 --> 22:10.288
the roof off this dump!

22:12.331 --> 22:14.625

22:25.469 --> 22:28.181
