00:03.670 --> 00:04.769
It's the brand-new us

00:04.771 --> 00:08.138
in brand-new, gently-used
outfits.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.975
The pit stains are vintage.

touching the diaper.

you girls in clothes.

00:22.386 --> 00:24.819
As new part owners
of the diner,

00:24.821 --> 00:26.053
we're making improvement.

00:26.055 --> 00:28.188
Heh, not in the food or decor

00:28.190 --> 00:30.623
'cause LOL.

00:30.625 --> 00:32.624

gonna look better.

uniforms anymore.

Cool.

00:39.565 --> 00:40.597

00:44.936 --> 00:48.137
The underwear is tear-away too.

00:48.139 --> 00:51.773
Don't say words.

00:51.775 --> 00:53.241
Oh, God!

00:53.243 --> 00:56.310

02:45.997 --> 02:49.064
Should we order
directly into your mouth?

02:52.002 --> 02:54.802
Han, since the diner
is now owner operated,

02:54.804 --> 02:57.171
if we have to wait on tables,
so do you.

02:57.173 --> 02:59.606
You're gonna cover our shifts
because our other business,

Max's heartbreak

03:11.485 --> 03:14.486

10:13.883 --> 10:15.682
I'm afraid they're gonna
call it a pool

10:15.684 --> 10:16.783
and try to raise our rent.

10:16.785 --> 10:18.451
Good!

10:18.453 --> 10:21.420
I'd love to have friends over
to my puddle for a change.

10:21.422 --> 10:23.655
Our liquor license
was supposed to come today.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.922
We should have
gotten mail by now.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.857
We also should have
left batteries

10:26.859 --> 10:28.191
in the carbon monoxide
detector,

10:28.193 --> 10:31.093
but I got tired
of all the beeping.

10:31.095 --> 10:34.329
Do your eyes feel
bloodier than usual?

10:35.432 --> 10:36.998
Hey, gals!

10:37.000 --> 10:39.667
Yeah, nope.
Still not a mother.

10:39.669 --> 10:42.803
Oh, I'm so bored.

10:42.805 --> 10:45.972
I've Netflix'd, Hulu'd,
Amazoned.

10:45.974 --> 10:49.842
I'm about to HBO GO
out of my mind.

10:49.844 --> 10:52.678
Sophie, where did you get
those Upsy Daisies?

10:52.680 --> 10:54.346
Oh, Han gave them to me.

10:54.348 --> 10:57.816
Yeah, and he tried to sell me
a time-share in the Poconos.

10:57.818 --> 10:59.684
Yeah, but I got to say,

10:59.686 --> 11:01.919
I was a little intrigued.

11:01.921 --> 11:03.387
Sophie, you shouldn't
be down here.

11:03.389 --> 11:05.889
There's a probable
carbon monoxide leak.

11:05.891 --> 11:07.991
You should go check out
our pool.

11:08.994 --> 11:11.361
Why did Han give you flowers?

11:11.363 --> 11:13.229
Is he trying to hit that?
(chuckles)

11:13.231 --> 11:16.465
Oh, well, he'd have
to reach that first.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.866
No, they were for you guys.

11:17.868 --> 11:19.868
Yeah, Caroline didn't want them.

11:19.870 --> 11:22.370
Yeah, but I'm not above
garbage flowers.

11:23.606 --> 11:26.273
These are from Randy
for me.

11:28.343 --> 11:30.009
You!

11:30.011 --> 11:32.511
Max, I didn't want to tell you
about the flowers.

11:32.513 --> 11:33.945
I didn't want to upset you.

11:33.947 --> 11:35.279
If you don't want
to upset me,

11:35.281 --> 11:38.382
then why do you
chew salad so loudly?

11:38.384 --> 11:41.351
Uh, she's got a point there,
Caroline.

11:47.525 --> 11:49.725
I am not mad.

11:49.727 --> 11:50.625
You're not?

11:50.627 --> 11:51.859
No.

11:51.861 --> 11:53.894
It was really nice
of Randy to send flowers

11:53.896 --> 11:55.896
and maybe I should call him.

11:55.898 --> 11:58.298
Bad idea to get in touch
with Randy.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.766
Very bad idea, like,

11:59.768 --> 12:01.400
jumpsuits on short women.

12:01.402 --> 12:02.401
What?

12:02.403 --> 12:03.668
He did a nice thing

12:03.670 --> 12:05.202
and I just want to thank him.

12:05.204 --> 12:06.770
We'll thank him together.

12:06.772 --> 12:08.304
You know what people
like to get nowadays?

12:08.306 --> 12:11.974
A handwritten note.
Let me grab my stationery.

12:11.976 --> 12:14.343
It's a Rite Aid receipt
so there's plenty of room.

12:15.679 --> 12:17.979
-Dear Randy--
-You know what?

12:17.981 --> 12:19.981
Just calling Randy is rude.

12:19.983 --> 12:21.649
Since when do you
worry about rude?

12:21.651 --> 12:23.317
-You interrupt almost every--
-I want to FaceTime him.

12:23.319 --> 12:24.651
(phone beeping)

12:24.653 --> 12:26.119
That's much worse, and you just
interrupted me ag--

12:26.121 --> 12:28.121
-Hi, Randy.
-Max!

12:28.123 --> 12:29.889
It's so great to hear from you.

12:29.891 --> 12:32.324
Is Caroline not there,
or is she standing behind you

12:32.326 --> 12:34.959
with her arms folded,
looking angry?

12:34.961 --> 12:37.194
My arms aren't folded,
they're on my hips.

12:37.196 --> 12:38.962
And I'm not angry,
but Max called you

12:38.964 --> 12:40.797
without my permission.

12:40.799 --> 12:43.599
Hi, Miss Channing.

12:43.601 --> 12:45.133
Max has to get off the phone.

12:45.135 --> 12:47.869
You're embarrassing me.

12:47.871 --> 12:49.470
Max, it took you three months

12:49.472 --> 12:51.905
and a palette of Cheetos
to get over him.

12:51.907 --> 12:54.406
RANDY: You covered the screen,
not the speaker.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.541
You shouldn't be
talking to him.

12:57.543 --> 12:58.808
(scoffs)

12:58.810 --> 13:00.209
You shouldn't be
wearing blue eye shadow.

13:00.211 --> 13:00.976
(gasps)

13:00.978 --> 13:02.744
You told me it looked nice

13:02.746 --> 13:05.446
and now I've ruined the receipt
and I can't take it back.

13:05.448 --> 13:07.881
RANDY:
Guys, I'm getting whiplash.

13:07.883 --> 13:08.781
You know what?

13:08.783 --> 13:11.850
Everyone just calm down.

13:11.852 --> 13:13.651
I'm just saying thank you.

13:13.653 --> 13:15.519
God-uh!

13:17.389 --> 13:18.454
Sophie, is it time?

13:18.456 --> 13:19.354
Are you in labor?

13:19.356 --> 13:21.189
No.
(panting)

13:21.191 --> 13:23.491
I broke my
masturbating underwear.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.393
Ah, but you know how that goes.

13:27.395 --> 13:28.394
I do not

13:28.396 --> 13:31.062
and I will not act
like I might.

13:32.031 --> 13:34.064
You know, you're a puzzle

13:34.066 --> 13:37.567
that I have
no interest in solving.

13:37.569 --> 13:38.634
Here's your mail.

13:38.636 --> 13:39.534
(gasps)
The mail.

13:39.536 --> 13:41.235
Our liquor license.

13:41.237 --> 13:41.902
Yeah.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.336
You know what,

13:43.338 --> 13:46.038
I think my masturbating
underwear is short-circuiting,

13:46.040 --> 13:49.474
but--eeh--oh--
but it feels pretty good.

13:51.544 --> 13:55.879
Is not coming because I made
a tiny mistake on the forms?

13:56.848 --> 13:58.747
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

13:58.749 --> 14:01.883
nobody knows
what a dessert bar is.

14:01.885 --> 14:02.917
And frankly,

14:02.919 --> 14:05.118
it just makes people angry.

14:07.722 --> 14:08.954
Max, I have bad news.

14:08.956 --> 14:11.189
Oh, my God--you're naked!

14:11.191 --> 14:13.591
I'm saying thank you to Randy.

14:15.094 --> 14:18.828
Looks like Randy
is thanking himself.

14:18.830 --> 14:20.162
Oh, hey, sorry about that.

14:20.164 --> 14:22.664
That thank you kind of
got away from us.

14:24.034 --> 14:26.034
Max, put your pants on,
we're going downtown.

14:26.036 --> 14:27.802
That's funny,
Randy just told me

14:27.804 --> 14:29.470
to take them off
for the same reason.

14:29.472 --> 14:32.272
<i>♪</i> ♪

14:34.242 --> 14:37.343
<i>♪</i> ♪

14:37.345 --> 14:39.044
Last time I saw
a line this long,

14:39.046 --> 14:41.346
it went up my nose.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.115
And I almost married
Katt Williams.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.182
Excuse me?

14:45.184 --> 14:47.118
Is there a different line
for people

14:47.120 --> 14:49.120
who just made one tiny mistake
and it's not her fault

14:49.122 --> 14:51.255
'cause she was just
overwhelmed at the time?

14:56.528 --> 14:58.294
Max, we're gonna die here.

14:58.296 --> 15:00.529
Ugh, finally.

15:00.531 --> 15:02.364
I'd give out flyers for the
dessert bar, but I just saw

15:02.366 --> 15:05.200
someone pull an unwrapped
cheese stick out of his pocket.

15:05.202 --> 15:08.236
I can't believe you
filled out a form wrong.

15:08.238 --> 15:09.971
Start a business much?

15:11.307 --> 15:14.608
Uh, in my defense,
this is kind of your fault.

15:14.610 --> 15:16.643
Me?
How is it my fault?

15:16.645 --> 15:20.246
I was in a fort made
out of pillows most of July.

15:20.248 --> 15:21.680
Or was it August?

15:21.682 --> 15:23.948
I don't know, you can lose
track of time in a fort.

15:23.950 --> 15:25.049
Exactly.

15:25.051 --> 15:27.084
I had to jackass
around this whole city

15:27.086 --> 15:28.819
to get the dessert bar ready
while you were

15:28.821 --> 15:31.221
rolling in the deep,
getting over Randy.

15:31.223 --> 15:32.755
So...

15:32.757 --> 15:35.257
hello from the other side.

15:37.094 --> 15:38.293
Girl fight.

15:38.295 --> 15:39.794
Worldstar.

15:41.798 --> 15:43.430
And now, after all that,

15:43.432 --> 15:46.466
I catch you going down
on Randy's iPhone.

15:46.468 --> 15:47.467
I'm warning you right now,

15:47.469 --> 15:49.502
I am not bathing you again.

15:49.504 --> 15:52.638
Look, there is a
mathematical formula

15:52.640 --> 15:54.473
involved in break-up sex.

15:54.475 --> 15:55.841
What do you know about math?

15:55.843 --> 15:59.411
You always leave out six
when you count to ten.

15:59.413 --> 16:00.512
Doesn't mean you're stupid.

16:00.514 --> 16:02.680
A lot of persons do that.

16:03.616 --> 16:05.716
Typically, in a break-up,

16:05.718 --> 16:07.117
if you live in the same city,

16:07.119 --> 16:09.152
you go to the guy's house
to pick up your stuff,

16:09.154 --> 16:09.819
and then you do it.

16:09.821 --> 16:11.320
That's one time.

16:11.322 --> 16:14.589
Then you "forget something"
and he brings it to your place

16:14.591 --> 16:15.456
and then you do it.

16:15.458 --> 16:16.623
That's two.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.591
Then you run into
each other at a bar,

16:18.593 --> 16:19.525
do it in the bathroom.

16:19.527 --> 16:20.792
Three.

16:20.794 --> 16:23.861
Then you fake a pregnancy.
That's four.

16:23.863 --> 16:26.363
Then he fakes an STD.
That's five.

16:26.365 --> 16:28.965
And then
you're broken up.

16:30.868 --> 16:32.500
There's been no math.

16:32.502 --> 16:34.635
(scoffs)
Five is a number.

16:34.637 --> 16:37.103
Numbers are math.
Read a book.

16:38.306 --> 16:40.339
Yeah.
Read a book.

16:40.341 --> 16:42.574
Name a book.

16:42.576 --> 16:44.075
The phone book.

16:45.311 --> 16:48.412
This line is for
municipal licenses only.

16:48.414 --> 16:51.481
Not driver's licenses,
wedding licenses, or whatnot.

16:51.483 --> 16:53.316
Municipal licenses.

16:53.318 --> 16:55.084
If you don't know what that is,
you're in the wrong line.

16:55.086 --> 16:56.885
How could you not know
what line

16:56.887 --> 16:58.253
you're supposed to be
standing in?

16:58.255 --> 16:59.887
(sighs)

17:02.725 --> 17:05.125
Randy, let me call you
back from the bathroom.

17:05.127 --> 17:07.359
I know where it is.
I used to work here.

17:07.362 --> 17:08.227
Max!

17:09.496 --> 17:10.862
Hey, Caroline.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.130
Oh, Max was just thanking me
for the flowers again.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.665
That's why I'm
not wearing a shirt.

17:15.666 --> 17:17.767
Or pants.

17:17.769 --> 17:19.769
Uh, let me call you back,
but keep your pants off.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.904
(chuckles)

17:21.906 --> 17:24.138
What?
I am not counting that as one.

17:24.141 --> 17:26.040
Were you really gonna
spank it

17:26.041 --> 17:28.242
in the middle of
the municipal building?

17:28.243 --> 17:29.676
Spank it?

17:29.678 --> 17:32.045
Don't be crass, Caroline.

17:32.047 --> 17:34.213
Yes.

17:34.215 --> 17:35.414
Next!

17:35.416 --> 17:36.548
Ding ding ding!

17:36.550 --> 17:37.916
It's just some clerical error

17:37.918 --> 17:39.851
so we should be able
to get our license today.

17:39.853 --> 17:40.952
Let me handle this.

17:40.954 --> 17:42.119
You know you have a history of

17:42.121 --> 17:44.354
getting slappy with bureaucrats.

17:45.490 --> 17:46.355
Hi.

17:46.357 --> 17:47.789
We got this in the mail,

17:47.791 --> 17:49.624
and there's been some
teensy little mistake--

17:49.626 --> 17:52.426
Well, well, well!

17:53.429 --> 17:55.629
Him!

17:55.631 --> 17:57.297
I've got this, Moesha.

17:57.299 --> 17:58.831
Why don't you go clean up
your little

17:58.833 --> 18:02.500
Lean Cuisine explosion
in the microwave?

18:02.502 --> 18:05.369
Oh, she's a mess.

18:05.371 --> 18:06.970
Now, how can I

18:06.972 --> 18:09.806
not help you two?

18:09.808 --> 18:11.841
This is your dead-end job?

18:11.843 --> 18:13.976
I pictured you working
as a drug mule

18:13.978 --> 18:16.611
or a seat filler on <i> The View.</i>

18:16.613 --> 18:19.146
That's a job?

18:19.148 --> 18:21.715
Dude, I just made a mistake
on the application.

18:21.717 --> 18:23.416
Can't you just
give us a break?

18:23.418 --> 18:25.151
Our dessert bar is supposed
to open tomorrow night.

18:25.153 --> 18:26.152
Please?

18:26.154 --> 18:27.620
I gave up a boyfriend
for this business,

18:27.622 --> 18:28.887
and I'm gonna mess up

18:28.889 --> 18:31.189
her pretty face
if it doesn't work out.

18:31.191 --> 18:32.657
Max, thank you.

18:32.659 --> 18:35.492
I was starting to think you
didn't think I was that pretty.

18:37.229 --> 18:39.829
If we don't fix this, we're
gonna have to delay our opening.

18:39.831 --> 18:41.430
So please?

18:41.432 --> 18:42.597
You know what?

18:42.599 --> 18:44.432
Let me talk to my supervisor.

18:45.735 --> 18:48.936

18:58.812 --> 19:01.646
I would make us a drink

all I can make is meth.

19:04.016 --> 19:05.548

19:05.550 --> 19:07.449
No, I was in a funk

it was out there.

39:34.807 --> 39:36.306
and also the
owner of the diner owes

39:36.308 --> 39:40.009
old butt-chin here
and the city $25,000.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.076
What?

39:41.078 --> 39:42.377
The diner is mine again?

39:42.379 --> 39:43.778
Yeah, sorry.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.446
(gasps)

39:45.448 --> 39:46.647
Yes!

39:46.649 --> 39:48.115
Yes!
Yes!

39:48.117 --> 39:50.016
I have my baby back.

39:50.018 --> 39:51.984
You have baby everything.

39:53.153 --> 39:55.920
I'm shutting you down
for 14 business days.

39:55.922 --> 39:57.855
And you're getting
a bill in the mail

39:57.857 --> 40:00.591
with very confusing
instructions.

40:00.593 --> 40:01.892
And...

40:01.894 --> 40:04.060
I'm having my birthday here.

40:05.163 --> 40:07.229
Let's bounce, 2 Chainz.

40:09.733 --> 40:11.432
So long, pal.

40:11.434 --> 40:12.933
You're gonna have to find
someone else

40:12.935 --> 40:14.700
to use as a chew toy.

40:16.570 --> 40:18.069
Oh, man.

40:18.071 --> 40:20.538
Sorry about the bar, girls.

40:20.540 --> 40:23.874
I mean, guess I'm gonna
have to get me a bottle of rosé

40:23.876 --> 40:25.642
and head over to
Mrs. Fields' again.

40:27.012 --> 40:28.945
Does she have a sister?

40:28.947 --> 40:31.180
Or a color TV?

40:31.182 --> 40:32.848
See you later, girls.

40:32.850 --> 40:35.150
It look like I'm gonna go party
with the old man right here.

40:38.588 --> 40:41.055
(indistinct chatter)

40:41.057 --> 40:42.890
Can you guys just
give us another minute?

40:42.892 --> 40:45.592
Or 14 business days?

40:45.594 --> 40:48.094
The only thing that
opened and closed faster than us

40:48.096 --> 40:50.596
was <i> Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot.</i>

40:50.598 --> 40:53.365
Well, at least I didn't get
a blow out for this.

40:53.367 --> 40:55.734
That lessens the sting
of a failed opening.

40:55.736 --> 40:57.001
Are you kidding?

40:57.003 --> 40:58.602
I think this is gonna
make us more popular.

40:58.604 --> 41:00.971
You know how people always want
what they can't have.

41:00.973 --> 41:03.373
Like you with everything.

41:03.375 --> 41:06.476
If that's true,
then why do you look upset?

41:06.478 --> 41:09.045
'Cause Randy and I
are really broken up.

41:09.047 --> 41:11.714
We burned through the
Affleck-Garner clause,

41:11.716 --> 41:14.083
the Cox-Arquette addendum.

41:14.085 --> 41:16.051
As soon as we got to
the Bieber-Gomez principle,

41:16.053 --> 41:18.520
we were ashamed of ourselves.

41:18.522 --> 41:21.389
Max, you're the queen
of not following the rules.

41:21.391 --> 41:22.957
"Rules, schmules," you say.

41:22.959 --> 41:24.091
Yes!

41:24.093 --> 41:26.093
Rules, schmules!

41:26.095 --> 41:28.494
And condoms, schmondoms.

41:30.197 --> 41:32.497
Yeah, that one's not great.

41:32.499 --> 41:34.699
What I'm saying is
you make stuff up.

41:34.701 --> 41:35.766
Like this dessert bar.

41:35.768 --> 41:37.134
And that was a great idea.

41:37.136 --> 41:39.769
So you should make up
rules for you and Randy.

41:39.771 --> 41:42.204
'Cause it really seems like
you guys care about each other.

41:42.206 --> 41:44.606
Yeah, you're right.

41:44.608 --> 41:46.040
Break-up, schmake-up.

41:46.042 --> 41:47.307
Now, go call Randy

41:47.309 --> 41:49.342
and make me want to
burn my iPad.

41:50.678 --> 41:53.879
Go, I'm begging you.

41:53.881 --> 41:55.680
Yeah, we're gonna kill it

41:55.682 --> 41:58.182
in 14 business days.
