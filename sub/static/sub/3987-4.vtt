Hey, what's going on?

26:32.280 --> 26:33.361
Long story.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.044
It turns out CASTOR Mark

26:35.120 --> 26:36.485
was undercover for the military.

26:36.600 --> 26:37.647
With the Proletheans?

26:37.920 --> 26:39.445
Yeah. And get this,

26:39.520 --> 26:40.851
Johanssen was Professor Duncan's

26:40.920 --> 26:42.524
lab assistant at Project LEDA.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.091
What? So Johanssen had
original CASTOR material?

26:46.280 --> 26:48.362
I think I'm looking at the box
he used to hold it in,

26:48.440 --> 26:51.967
but there's nothing here
except old journals and shit.

27:10.400 --> 27:11.561
<i>What does that mean?</i>

27:11.640 --> 27:13.961
Somatic cell nuclear transfer,
that's how you clone.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.760
So... Wait, Johanssen used
the samples, then,

27:16.840 --> 27:19.286
to try and make more clones.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.041
God-complex much.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.805
If that's what he did and succeeded,
then that child would have

27:23.880 --> 27:25.962
the exact same DNA
as the CASTOR original.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.530
Well, then I'm not looking
for tissue samples,

27:27.600 --> 27:29.887
- I'm looking for Johanssen's son.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

27:29.960 --> 27:31.405
Well, and he would have needed embryos.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.285

28:22.560 --> 28:24.085

28:24.160 --> 28:27.084
What happened, Gracie,

28:28.120 --> 28:30.168
is that you betrayed your family.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.882
God wanted to punish you.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.050
So he cursed you, and he took the child.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.725

28:50.360 --> 28:52.567
The only reason our door
was open to you again

28:52.640 --> 28:54.529
was because of that child,
and now it's gone.

There's a chance!

30:03.360 --> 30:05.328

30:05.400 --> 30:07.289
The reason we can't find
the CASTOR samples

30:07.360 --> 30:09.362
is because Johanssen used them,

30:09.440 --> 30:11.090

30:11.200 --> 30:12.247
MARK: What?

30:12.840 --> 30:14.205

30:14.280 --> 30:16.681
they used the original tissue
to make a son.

30:18.360 --> 30:21.125
We find him, we get a bit of DNA.
That's all we need.
