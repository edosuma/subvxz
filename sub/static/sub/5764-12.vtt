WEBVTT

00:01.470 --> 00:03.237
Oh, please don't worry, sir.

00:03.305 --> 00:04.971
The walkers are taking great care

00:05.040 --> 00:06.474
Of your rental property.

00:06.542 --> 00:09.377
They just haven't had a chance
to stop in and sign the lease.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.579
Um...

00:11.647 --> 00:12.747
Yes.

00:12.814 --> 00:15.816
Yep, I have the lease right here.

00:15.884 --> 00:17.184
Uh-huh.

00:17.252 --> 00:19.253
No, I will have them come in, sign it today,

00:19.321 --> 00:20.588
And then I'll drop it off, of course.

00:20.656 --> 00:22.990
Ok. Sounds good, thanks. Bye-bye.

00:23.058 --> 00:26.193
my assistant is great with the clients,

00:26.261 --> 00:29.163
But she is so organizationally impaired.

00:29.231 --> 00:30.331
Ha, here it is.

00:30.399 --> 00:34.168
Walker. Who puts walker in with the ms?

00:34.236 --> 00:35.736
An upside down person.

00:35.804 --> 00:37.939
Ah. You know what,
I don't see the humor in that.

00:38.006 --> 00:39.407
But could you please tell me

00:39.474 --> 00:42.143
What possessed me to branch
out into the rental business?

00:42.210 --> 00:43.878
Uh, ned's college tuition.

00:43.946 --> 00:45.212
I take it you can't go to lunch.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.314
Oh, I wish I could.

00:46.381 --> 00:48.983
I am so swamped.

00:49.051 --> 00:52.853
Hey. I thought you said
you had classes all day.

00:52.921 --> 00:56.023
Yeah, but I had a break and you
sounded stressed on the phone, so...

00:56.091 --> 00:59.994
You came by to save me.
Oh, honey, I love you.

01:00.062 --> 01:01.262
You know what, you could totally

01:01.330 --> 01:03.431
Help me if you could
just drop off this lease.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.766
The landlord is giving me
grief because it isn't signed.

01:05.834 --> 01:09.036
And I need to, right, get the keys

01:09.104 --> 01:12.473
And drop them off at the rental property.

01:12.541 --> 01:14.241
Walker. I think I know their daughter.

01:14.309 --> 01:15.643
Oh, I doubt it. The family

01:15.711 --> 01:16.877
Just moved to town recently.

01:16.945 --> 01:19.213
No, katie, that's her.

01:19.281 --> 01:21.415
She started working at the
dance center next to my gym

01:21.483 --> 01:22.617
About six weeks ago.

01:22.684 --> 01:25.019
Huh, really? Wonder how you would know that,

01:25.087 --> 01:26.887
Since you let your membership lapse

01:26.955 --> 01:29.223
Because there was that great
free facility up on the campus.

01:29.291 --> 01:32.059
This gym has better towels.

01:32.127 --> 01:33.394
Towels?

01:33.462 --> 01:35.563
Maybe there are other benefits.

01:35.631 --> 01:37.465
Mm-hmm, like katie.

01:37.532 --> 01:38.866
You know what,

01:38.934 --> 01:40.234
I think I can drop by the lease

01:40.302 --> 01:41.802
And you could drop off the keys.

01:41.870 --> 01:43.537
Mom...

01:43.605 --> 01:44.872
No, don't "mom" me, ned.

01:44.940 --> 01:46.107
This girl is fresh off

01:46.174 --> 01:47.775
Of the hay wagon from ohio.

01:47.843 --> 01:49.076
Yeah, she's different.

01:49.144 --> 01:50.177
I like that about her.

01:50.245 --> 01:52.213
Her? And who else?

01:52.280 --> 01:54.315
Seriously, ned, how many girls

01:54.383 --> 01:55.650
Are you stringing along now?

01:55.717 --> 01:57.151
None.

01:57.219 --> 01:58.519
I learned my lesson.

01:58.587 --> 02:01.188
Katie gets off work in about 20 minutes,

02:01.256 --> 02:02.990
So I better run.

02:04.593 --> 02:07.028
He knows her work schedule.

02:07.095 --> 02:09.663
Yep, and I bet he's not
coming back for these.

02:12.267 --> 02:13.668
Hello. Hi, thanks.

02:13.735 --> 02:15.703
Hey, katie. Hey, ned.

02:15.771 --> 02:16.837
Hang on.

02:16.905 --> 02:18.172
Oh, thanks. I'm not working out.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.840
Thursday is a skip day.

02:19.908 --> 02:22.743
Oh. So you just came by to say hi?

02:22.811 --> 02:24.645
Actually, I'm doing my mom a favor.

02:24.713 --> 02:26.347
She's a realtor.

02:26.415 --> 02:27.448
There you go. Thanks.

02:27.516 --> 02:28.649
She rented you guys your house.

02:28.717 --> 02:30.685
Apparently your parents
forgot to sign the lease.

02:30.752 --> 02:32.987
Got it.

02:33.055 --> 02:35.723
But why are you bringing
it to me and not them?

02:35.791 --> 02:37.391
I don't know.

02:37.459 --> 02:38.592
Here you are. Thanks, katie.

02:38.660 --> 02:39.994
I thought maybe we could grab a bite.

02:40.062 --> 02:41.929
You get off soon, right?

02:41.997 --> 02:43.364
In case you're interested. Great.

02:43.432 --> 02:45.533
Hey, we're having dance company auditions.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.702
Do you think you could put a
few of these up on campus?

02:47.769 --> 02:49.603
I've seen this.

02:49.671 --> 02:51.005
My mom used to drag me

02:51.073 --> 02:52.506
To this show every year.

02:52.574 --> 02:54.809
Mm-hmm? And I really enjoyed it.

02:54.876 --> 02:56.777
Are you going to audition?

02:56.845 --> 02:58.345
No. I'd love to,

02:58.413 --> 03:01.348
But I'm just not at that level, really.

03:01.416 --> 03:03.117
I just started taking dance classes.

03:03.185 --> 03:05.019
Are you?

03:06.221 --> 03:08.255
What are you still doing here?

03:08.323 --> 03:10.591
We were supposed to meet out front.

03:10.659 --> 03:12.093
You had plans?

03:12.160 --> 03:15.396
Yeah. I mean, no.

03:15.464 --> 03:17.832
Ned, this is mike, my brother.

03:18.834 --> 03:20.935
oh. Hey.

03:21.002 --> 03:22.603
Good to meet you.

03:22.671 --> 03:25.239
Don't make us wait.

03:25.307 --> 03:27.508
I guess this means we're
not grabbing a bite?

03:27.576 --> 03:29.376
Yeah.

03:34.316 --> 03:37.218
Katie, wait. You forgot the lease.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

03:49.831 --> 03:51.599
I don't get it.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.901
I mean, why do you always
have to be such a creep

03:53.969 --> 03:55.002
To any guy I ever like?

03:55.070 --> 03:56.771
You know why.

04:01.343 --> 04:02.543
Yeah, we should.

04:02.611 --> 04:03.811
What do you think? I mean, I just--

04:08.283 --> 04:10.384
mike, oh, my god!

04:10.452 --> 04:11.519
Someone help! Hurry! Mike!

04:14.289 --> 04:15.623
Mike!

04:34.042 --> 04:35.843
Oh, you ok?

04:35.911 --> 04:36.977
Mike, are you ok? No, no, no!

04:37.045 --> 04:38.479
Hey, look, I'm calling 9-1-1.

04:38.547 --> 04:41.348
No, don't, don't.
He's our son, we've got this.

04:41.416 --> 04:43.184
Come on, sweetie.

04:43.251 --> 04:44.485
Come on.

04:47.422 --> 04:48.856
Excuse me.

04:48.924 --> 04:51.525
My husband's a doctor and
I just saw what happened!

04:51.593 --> 04:53.360
That's ok. We're fine.

04:53.428 --> 04:54.728
Are you sure that you--

04:54.796 --> 04:56.430
Thank you.

04:56.498 --> 04:58.132
Are you sure that you don't need help?!

05:00.335 --> 05:03.270
Let me guess-- that's the
girl you have a thing for?

05:03.338 --> 05:05.306
Yeah, katie.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.309
Kind of weird, huh.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.445
Weirder than you think.

05:17.185 --> 05:19.353
Child, whispering: Can you see us?

05:19.421 --> 05:29.423
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

05:50.994 --> 05:52.495
So soda just shoots out at the guy?

05:52.563 --> 05:53.730
Bam, bam, bam!

05:53.797 --> 05:54.831
Yeah. And the strange part

05:54.898 --> 05:56.032
Is that their son is bleeding,

05:56.100 --> 05:57.233
There's a hospital across the street,

05:57.301 --> 05:58.501
And the parents just took off.

05:58.569 --> 06:00.169
That is odd.

06:00.237 --> 06:02.071
Yeah, it's like they knew
they were being haunted.

06:02.139 --> 06:03.272
We don't know that they were.

06:03.340 --> 06:04.607
You didn't see a ghost. Yeah, but--

06:04.675 --> 06:06.209
And the soda could have been overheated.

06:06.276 --> 06:08.077
Except for the fact that I was kne
e-deep in a mud vision

06:08.145 --> 06:09.178
When it all exploded.

06:09.246 --> 06:12.014
Which kind of screams ghost. You know, ned,

06:12.082 --> 06:14.717
We gotta look at why you keep
hooking up with haunted babes.

06:14.785 --> 06:19.188
Or why you see a ghost
every time I like someone.

06:19.256 --> 06:20.957
Wait a minute.

06:21.024 --> 06:23.292
Did my mom put you up to this?

06:23.360 --> 06:25.161
Is this her way of keeping me in line?

06:25.229 --> 06:27.597
You know what, ned, your mom just
actually wants you to be happy,

06:27.664 --> 06:28.664
And safe.

06:28.732 --> 06:30.333
Which dating a haunted girl isn't.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.068
You probably dated a
haunted girl in college,

06:32.136 --> 06:33.369
You just didn't know it.

06:33.437 --> 06:34.937
And at least one possessed bio major,

06:35.005 --> 06:36.739
Judging from the live
frogs I found in my bed.

06:36.807 --> 06:37.774
I'd also like to get to know katie

06:37.841 --> 06:38.908
Without you two buzzing around.

06:38.976 --> 06:41.177
So if I'm a responsible adult

06:41.245 --> 06:42.512
Like my mom says,

06:42.579 --> 06:45.181
Why don't you two treat
me like one, and butt out?

06:50.954 --> 06:53.222
I'm calling delia.

07:14.311 --> 07:16.813
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.615
We're closed. You shouldn't be here.

07:19.683 --> 07:21.918
You're an amazing dancer.

07:21.985 --> 07:23.419
I thought you said you were just learning.

07:23.487 --> 07:25.021
I am.

07:25.088 --> 07:27.089
What are you, some sort of dance expert now?

07:27.157 --> 07:29.959
Look, if you want me to keep your
dancing under wraps, that's cool.

07:30.027 --> 07:31.694
I'll pretend I was never here.

07:31.762 --> 07:33.563
Sorry.

07:33.630 --> 07:35.298
It's not you.

07:35.365 --> 07:38.668
I just get all moody when I
first move to a new place.

07:38.735 --> 07:40.269
Which is a lot lately.

07:40.337 --> 07:41.604
My dad's in construction

07:41.672 --> 07:43.639
And work's been thin,
so we go where the jobs are.

07:43.707 --> 07:45.107
I guess I'm just sick of it.

07:45.175 --> 07:47.343
It's funny-- the only time I've ever moved

07:47.411 --> 07:50.379
Is from a house in
grandview to an apartment.

07:50.447 --> 07:54.317
I guess that's really all I ever remember.

07:54.384 --> 07:56.185
You are so lucky.

07:56.253 --> 07:58.387
It must be scary having to
make new friends all the time.

07:58.455 --> 08:01.691
No, what's scary is when you get good at it.

08:01.758 --> 08:04.961
You move to so many places so many times,

08:05.028 --> 08:07.496
You don't even know who you are anymore.

08:07.564 --> 08:09.799
Some things feel strange about a town,

08:09.867 --> 08:11.234
And you're not sure if it isn't just you.

08:13.704 --> 08:16.205
God. can I talk any more?

08:16.273 --> 08:17.607
I wish you would.

08:17.674 --> 08:19.275
But it's fine if you don't.

08:19.343 --> 08:21.077
In fact, it's more than fine.

08:21.144 --> 08:24.780
How about from now on,
anything you don't want to tell me,

08:24.848 --> 08:26.782
I don't want to know, ok?

08:26.850 --> 08:28.050
Ok.

08:28.118 --> 08:29.819
Ok.

08:29.887 --> 08:32.922
You know, since you're here,

08:32.990 --> 08:34.222
I could use a partner.

08:34.291 --> 08:35.291
A partner?

08:35.359 --> 08:36.692
Mm-hmm.

08:37.861 --> 08:40.229
You put your arm out.

08:40.297 --> 08:42.732
Now pull me in.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.700
Now dip me.

08:44.768 --> 08:46.502
Mm-hmm. Good.

08:46.570 --> 08:49.272
No, stay there.

08:55.646 --> 08:57.213
Ok.

08:57.281 --> 08:58.547
It just--this isn't right, you know?

08:58.615 --> 09:00.416
I tell ned that he has to be responsible

09:00.484 --> 09:02.285
And make the right choices,

09:02.352 --> 09:03.653
And now I'm helping you spy on him.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.888
And he's just starting
to open up to me again.

09:05.956 --> 09:07.623
Look, I understand that you
don't want to break ned's trust,

09:07.691 --> 09:08.991
But if these people are haunted,

09:09.059 --> 09:10.192
It's my job to help.

09:10.260 --> 09:11.727
This ghost blows things up.

09:11.795 --> 09:14.263
Ok, fine, let's just make it quick.

09:18.335 --> 09:20.403
Delia, well.

09:20.470 --> 09:21.437
Hello.

09:21.505 --> 09:23.272
Hey, dave.

09:23.340 --> 09:24.807
Um, this is my friend melinda.

09:27.511 --> 09:30.179
Don't I know you?

09:31.448 --> 09:33.382
Uh, sort of.

09:33.450 --> 09:35.418
We met yesterday at the gas station.

09:35.485 --> 09:38.054
And when mel and I made the connection

09:38.121 --> 09:39.155
That I was your realtor--

09:39.222 --> 09:41.157
I wanted to welcome you to town

09:41.224 --> 09:43.759
And see how your son was doing.

09:43.827 --> 09:45.027
This is some stuff from my shop.

09:45.095 --> 09:46.262
How nice. Thank you.

09:46.330 --> 09:48.831
Yeah, my son's fine.

09:48.899 --> 09:50.566
Strange as that accident was.

09:50.634 --> 09:52.635
Thick-headed like his dad, I guess.

09:52.703 --> 09:55.137
How sweet.

09:55.205 --> 09:57.807
Look, I'd ask you in, but we're
just heading out for the evening.

09:57.874 --> 09:59.742
Oh, well, that's ok.

09:59.810 --> 10:01.243
If you can just sign the lease,

10:01.311 --> 10:02.478
You know, I could finally
get out of your hair.

10:02.546 --> 10:03.879
Excuse me. Excuse us.

10:03.947 --> 10:05.514
Yeah, we're in kind of a hurry.

10:05.582 --> 10:07.316
What if I just drop it by the office?

10:07.384 --> 10:09.986
All right. See you later, thanks.

10:11.388 --> 10:14.623
They were not planning on heading out.

10:14.691 --> 10:16.492
I could smell that they were cooking dinner,

10:16.560 --> 10:20.262
And I saw that she had
marinara sauce on her apron.

10:21.531 --> 10:22.898
Oh, my god.

10:22.966 --> 10:24.633
I am so dead.

10:24.701 --> 10:26.969
Ok, hurry. Run before ned can yell at us.

10:27.037 --> 10:28.270
All right.

10:31.074 --> 10:32.475
Katie...

10:32.542 --> 10:34.543
We have to go, hon.

10:34.611 --> 10:36.412
She'll be fine. Uh-huh.

10:39.182 --> 10:42.084
I really appreciate you taking
a look at this old junker.

10:42.152 --> 10:43.953
My dad won't buy me a new one.

10:44.021 --> 10:45.888
Hey, I get it. Money's tight, you know?

10:45.956 --> 10:47.623
It's not so much that.

10:47.691 --> 10:49.725
He's anti-trashing anything.

10:49.793 --> 10:52.128
Says we live in a disposable culture

10:52.195 --> 10:53.462
That's ruining our planet.

10:53.530 --> 10:54.630
Well, he's right.

10:54.698 --> 10:56.298
You know, I bet I can fix this.

10:56.366 --> 10:57.833
Oh, killer.

10:57.901 --> 10:59.702
I mean, I don't need it
for school or anything.

10:59.770 --> 11:01.404
I'm taking a year off.

11:01.471 --> 11:03.205
But gotta go online.

11:03.273 --> 11:05.007
Oh!

11:05.075 --> 11:07.009
Oh, god, no. Please don't do this.

11:09.479 --> 11:12.381
What the hell? What is this?

11:12.449 --> 11:13.849
It won't turn off!

11:13.917 --> 11:15.651
Make it stop! Just make it stop!

11:15.719 --> 11:17.219
Why is this happening?!

11:21.091 --> 11:22.324
It's mud.

11:22.392 --> 11:24.160
Yeah, it's mud. So what?

11:24.227 --> 11:26.562
You've seen this before, haven't you?

11:31.101 --> 11:32.902
Oh, please. Not again.

11:32.969 --> 11:34.336
Mom, dad, you're back.

11:34.404 --> 11:36.605
Ned was just leaving.

11:36.673 --> 11:38.541
It's a good thing, apparently.

11:38.608 --> 11:41.544
Hon, we've rented plenty of houses.

11:41.611 --> 11:43.612
Shouldn't be surprised
when the plumbing's bad.

11:45.348 --> 11:46.849
You're right.

11:46.917 --> 11:49.251
I should know better.

11:49.319 --> 11:50.586
I'm gonna go get some towels.

11:50.654 --> 11:54.023
Yeah. Katie's right, my friend.

11:54.091 --> 11:56.058
You should probably be going.

12:03.233 --> 12:04.967
You sure I can't help?

12:05.035 --> 12:08.604
No, it's nothing my dad can't deal with.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.116
Since when do we bring people into our home?

12:25.589 --> 12:27.756
So it turns out I was wrong.

12:27.824 --> 12:30.993
Looks like katie's family is haunted.

12:31.061 --> 12:32.695
But I guess you already knew that.

12:32.762 --> 12:34.063
Yeah. Melinda had a vision

12:34.131 --> 12:35.131
When we were at the house.

12:35.198 --> 12:36.332
Here. Thanks.

12:36.399 --> 12:38.033
I'm so sorry, honey. Look at you.

12:38.101 --> 12:39.768
Are you ok? Yeah, I'm fine.

12:39.836 --> 12:40.970
Any idea who the ghost is?

12:41.037 --> 12:43.439
we don't know.

12:43.507 --> 12:45.574
Actually, it turns out
there's a lot we don't know.

12:45.642 --> 12:48.110
In my vision, katie's parents and brother,

12:48.178 --> 12:50.346
They had no faces.

12:50.413 --> 12:52.748
So we did a little bit more research.

12:52.816 --> 12:54.250
You know, I went back over
the rental application,

12:54.317 --> 12:55.618
The credit check.

12:55.685 --> 12:58.087
I thought if I could go
back a few more years

12:58.155 --> 12:59.922
Than I first had... Find anything?

12:59.990 --> 13:02.491
Nothing, literally.

13:02.559 --> 13:03.859
There's no previous employment,

13:03.927 --> 13:05.494
No rentals, no rÃ©sumÃ©s,

13:05.562 --> 13:07.796
Everything we looked at was a dead end.

13:07.864 --> 13:10.766
Yeah, and we even checked their
places and dates of birth,

13:10.834 --> 13:13.669
And the county clerk had no record of them.

13:13.737 --> 13:15.271
So that's why they had no faces.

13:15.338 --> 13:17.173
They don't exist.

13:27.095 --> 13:29.763
How does an entire family fall off the grid?

13:29.830 --> 13:31.097
Well, it's not that hard these days.

13:31.165 --> 13:33.866
I mean, you can get a social
and get credit reports,

13:33.934 --> 13:35.134
Even a college degree online.

13:35.202 --> 13:37.370
Yeah, but why? I mean,
who would want to do that?

13:37.437 --> 13:39.071
People who don't want to be found.

13:39.139 --> 13:41.240
Right. Ok, I'm going to go out on a limb

13:41.308 --> 13:43.342
And say people who are on the run.

13:43.410 --> 13:46.579
Ok, so, someone besides
the ghost is after them.

13:46.647 --> 13:48.047
Right. Right.

13:48.115 --> 13:50.483
But why would a whole family go into hiding?

13:50.551 --> 13:51.784
Ah, they did something illegal.

13:51.852 --> 13:52.818
They committed a crime.

13:52.886 --> 13:54.554
Yeah, or they didn't commit a crime

13:54.621 --> 13:55.922
And they witnessed one.

13:55.989 --> 13:58.291
Wait, so you're thinking witness protection?

13:58.358 --> 14:00.326
You could always ask
detective blair about this.

14:00.394 --> 14:01.961
Yeah, but even if she was willing,

14:02.029 --> 14:03.396
Do you think she'd get anywhere?

14:03.463 --> 14:06.132
I mean, their identities
are protected, right?

14:06.200 --> 14:08.034
Yeah, but it's worth a try.

14:08.101 --> 14:10.403
You haven't even seen this ghost, have you?

14:10.470 --> 14:11.437
No.

14:11.505 --> 14:13.039
So really, it could be anybody.

14:13.106 --> 14:14.707
A murderer, victim, man, woman.

14:14.775 --> 14:16.943
Ok, you're making this sound
a lot harder than I thought.

14:17.010 --> 14:18.511
Sorry.

14:18.579 --> 14:21.781
Wait a minute. Ned's in a
good position to find out.

14:21.848 --> 14:24.450
Why don't you keep asking him
to hang out with the girl?

14:24.518 --> 14:26.586
Yeah. Something tells
me I won't have to ask.

14:28.188 --> 14:29.622
Hey, I'm just leaving now.

14:29.690 --> 14:31.457
I'll see you soon. Ok, bye.

14:31.525 --> 14:33.092
Katie.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.694
Katie, hey.

14:34.761 --> 14:37.063
Hey, I left you a message. How are you?

14:37.130 --> 14:38.598
Good. Fine. Just busy.

14:38.665 --> 14:40.433
And I'm late to meet someone.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.635
Oh, really? Who, your brother?

14:42.703 --> 14:44.237
A friend. Ok.

14:44.304 --> 14:46.706
Hey, what's this deal
with all the mud, anyways?

14:46.773 --> 14:50.009
And your parents leaving the house
with dinner still in the oven?

14:50.077 --> 14:51.911
They left a meal for us, so what?

14:51.979 --> 14:53.246
I thought it was nice.

14:53.313 --> 14:54.981
They didn't really seem to want me there.

14:55.048 --> 14:56.282
They're protective.

14:56.350 --> 14:57.316
What are they protecting you from?

14:57.384 --> 14:58.651
What are you talking about?

14:58.719 --> 15:00.486
All the weird stuff that
happens to your family.

15:00.554 --> 15:02.722
The bottles blowing up at the gas station?

15:02.789 --> 15:04.724
What do you think it's all about?

15:04.791 --> 15:06.292
Katie, hey.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.995
You can trust me, I swear.

15:09.062 --> 15:11.797
I think you should stay away from me.

15:11.865 --> 15:13.165
Is that what you want?

15:14.401 --> 15:16.869
Or stop asking questions I can't answer.

15:16.937 --> 15:18.037
Maybe I can help.

15:18.105 --> 15:19.171
You said whatever I don't want to tell you--

15:19.239 --> 15:21.140
I don't have to know. I remember.

15:21.208 --> 15:23.309
It's different now.

15:23.377 --> 15:25.811
Katie, I'm worried about you.

15:27.914 --> 15:29.782
Ned...

15:29.850 --> 15:32.451
You asked me to trust you,

15:32.519 --> 15:35.087
So why can't you trust me?

15:35.155 --> 15:36.455
Please.

15:36.523 --> 15:39.859
It's the only way this can work.

15:49.836 --> 15:52.204
Ned thinks katie knows about the ghost.

15:52.272 --> 15:54.774
Yeah, but he doesn't know
what they're running from.

15:54.841 --> 15:56.142
Can't run from a ghost,

15:56.209 --> 15:57.843
So it has to be a real person.

15:57.911 --> 15:59.779
Maybe the ghost is doing
all these public hauntings

15:59.846 --> 16:01.180
Because it wants them to get caught.

16:01.248 --> 16:02.381
No.

16:02.449 --> 16:04.650
I'm right here, and I'm ready to listen.

16:04.718 --> 16:06.986
Whoever this is wants them to run.

16:07.054 --> 16:09.789
Ugh, can you imagine?
Just all those new houses and jobs

16:09.856 --> 16:12.358
And schools and friends.

16:12.426 --> 16:14.593
Always lying about who you
are and where you came from.

16:14.661 --> 16:16.228
It's gotta be torture.

16:16.296 --> 16:18.364
Yeah. This ghost definitely wants revenge.

16:18.432 --> 16:19.465
On the whole family?

16:19.533 --> 16:21.334
What did they do?

16:21.401 --> 16:23.469
hey, delia,

16:23.537 --> 16:25.004
Melinda.

16:25.072 --> 16:26.105
Hey, mike.

16:26.173 --> 16:27.840
Is everything ok with the house?

16:27.908 --> 16:30.176
Oh, yeah, great. My mom loves it.

16:30.243 --> 16:32.845
Really? Even with all the mud?

16:32.913 --> 16:35.915
Oh, ned told you about
that broken pipe, huh?

16:35.982 --> 16:38.184
My dad didn't want you to sweat it.

16:38.251 --> 16:39.719
He just fixed it himself.

16:39.786 --> 16:41.487
That was really thoughtful of him.

16:41.555 --> 16:44.790
Anyway. Oh, um, my mom dug that gift basket

16:44.858 --> 16:46.826
You gave her, and she hates
to let a good mason jar

16:46.893 --> 16:48.861
Go to waste. So she wanted me

16:48.929 --> 16:51.697
To drop this by. It's raspberry.

16:51.765 --> 16:53.833
just shut up, lydia!

16:53.900 --> 16:56.001
Wait!

16:56.069 --> 16:58.337
No, no, no, no!

17:02.476 --> 17:04.877
Wait! No, please!

17:04.944 --> 17:06.878
No, please!

17:06.946 --> 17:08.714
I said shut up!

17:08.781 --> 17:12.050
Oh, I'm such a klutz. I--

17:19.425 --> 17:21.594
I got it.

17:22.628 --> 17:25.598
Uh, anyway...

17:25.665 --> 17:27.566
I gotta run.

17:31.204 --> 17:34.340
That boy wanted to hurt that girl.

17:41.548 --> 17:44.049
That's his necklace.

17:49.923 --> 17:52.291
is he asleep?

17:52.359 --> 17:53.893
He's out cold.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.528
Did he say anything about the vision?

17:55.595 --> 17:57.530
I asked him and he doesn't remember.

17:57.597 --> 17:58.931
Don't worry.

17:58.999 --> 18:00.466
He lets these things in,

18:00.534 --> 18:01.834
Then he lets them go.

18:01.902 --> 18:04.236
Good. 'cause it was a violent vision.

18:04.304 --> 18:07.139
You saw this guy hurt this girl?

18:07.207 --> 18:08.607
The walkers are protecting
their son from something.

18:08.675 --> 18:09.742
That's why they're running;

18:09.810 --> 18:11.577
That's why they don't have any faces.

18:11.645 --> 18:12.945
Katie's brother, he was so detached.

18:13.013 --> 18:15.214
I mean, he was wearing her necklace.

18:15.282 --> 18:16.782
The one he ripped off that
girl in your vision, right?

18:18.051 --> 18:20.286
Is that like some kind
of trophy or something?

18:20.353 --> 18:22.087
Maybe. Sick, huh?

18:22.155 --> 18:23.088
Yeah.

18:23.156 --> 18:24.390
Poor girl.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.492
So she's your ghost?

18:26.560 --> 18:28.928
It makes sense.

18:28.995 --> 18:30.563
I don't know what I would do

18:30.630 --> 18:31.897
If aiden ever hurt someone like that.

18:31.965 --> 18:34.500
Hey, hey, that is never going to happen.

18:34.568 --> 18:36.502
Katie's parents thought that, too.

18:36.570 --> 18:38.938
You need to stop thinking
about this right now

18:39.005 --> 18:40.606
And go to bed, ok?

18:40.674 --> 18:42.908
I'll go take out the trash.
I'll be up in a minute.

18:42.976 --> 18:44.043
Ok.

18:55.722 --> 18:57.490
What are you doing here?

18:57.557 --> 19:00.526
Have you been haunting that family?

19:00.594 --> 19:03.629
Who are you?

19:03.697 --> 19:05.831
What do you want from them?

19:05.899 --> 19:07.900
Only what they owe me.

19:07.968 --> 19:10.035
He can never stop paying for what he did.

19:20.073 --> 19:21.773
Look, if the ghost is a man,

19:21.841 --> 19:22.774
Then the girl that you saw in your vision

19:22.842 --> 19:23.942
Could still be alive.

19:24.010 --> 19:25.110
Yeah, but I still don't know her connection

19:25.178 --> 19:26.812
To the ghost. Yeah, I know.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.213
But there's gotta be something.

19:28.281 --> 19:29.448
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

19:29.516 --> 19:30.649
You said that he was
covered with mud, right?

19:30.717 --> 19:32.251
Yeah, I could barely see his uniform.

19:32.318 --> 19:34.520
Well, the girl in your
vision had mud on her, huh?

19:34.587 --> 19:35.921
On the path?

19:35.989 --> 19:37.723
So maybe the ghost is a
boyfriend or a brother

19:37.790 --> 19:38.991
Who died trying to protect her.

19:39.058 --> 19:40.425
Yeah, but why wouldn't he have told me that?

19:40.493 --> 19:42.394
Yeah. Wait, no, you said it yourself.

19:42.462 --> 19:44.630
You know, maybe he's trying to torture
them by keeping them on the run.

19:44.697 --> 19:47.900
I know. You've probably already thought
about this about four or five times, huh?

19:47.967 --> 19:49.935
Eight, ten, thirty, to say the least.

19:50.003 --> 19:51.436
But I don't know what that is.

19:51.504 --> 19:52.704
What is that?

19:52.772 --> 19:55.073
Credit check authorization
for one dustin harris.

19:55.141 --> 19:56.642
In the walker file? Yeah.

19:56.709 --> 19:59.111
Get back, check the basement.

19:59.179 --> 20:01.613
Move! Watch your weapons, there's kids.

20:01.681 --> 20:04.349
Quickly, quickly!

20:08.922 --> 20:10.923
Clear!

20:15.795 --> 20:18.230
Clear.

20:18.298 --> 20:19.331
Clear. All clear upstairs!

20:19.399 --> 20:20.599
Something must have tipped them off.

20:20.667 --> 20:22.301
They're a step ahead of us.

20:22.368 --> 20:24.503
Clear. Clear in back!

20:35.315 --> 20:36.548
Mel, you ok?

20:36.616 --> 20:39.651
Yeah. Um, I think the ghost

20:39.719 --> 20:40.986
Put this here for a reason.

20:41.054 --> 20:42.454
The credit report? Where did he get it?

20:42.522 --> 20:45.624
The walkers. Look at the handwriting.

20:45.692 --> 20:47.759
It's almost identical.

20:47.827 --> 20:49.761
Yeah, dave walker is dustin harris.

20:49.829 --> 20:51.830
Harris was just an alias.

20:51.898 --> 20:53.265
Did you get that in the vision?

20:53.333 --> 20:54.800
I think I was in their house.

20:54.867 --> 20:56.034
And they ran again, you know,

20:56.102 --> 20:57.236
Just left everything behind.

20:57.303 --> 20:59.071
Look, I think whatever katie's brother did,

20:59.138 --> 21:00.839
The ghost is just trying to
make sure that the family

21:00.907 --> 21:02.808
Is one step ahead of the law.

21:02.875 --> 21:04.843
No more, no less.

21:06.179 --> 21:08.513
What did detective blair say?

21:08.581 --> 21:10.082
That she loves my jacket.

21:10.149 --> 21:11.183
Eli...

21:11.251 --> 21:12.517
She said if she's going to call the fbi,

21:12.585 --> 21:14.086
She's going to need something more.

21:14.153 --> 21:15.120
Like what?

21:15.188 --> 21:16.922
More than mud, ghosts,

21:16.990 --> 21:18.423
And exploding soda.

21:18.491 --> 21:19.725
She's going to need something concrete.

21:19.792 --> 21:21.260
Ok, well, what about the
form the ghost gave us?

21:21.327 --> 21:22.961
It's got to have a signature,
fingerprints...

21:23.029 --> 21:24.997
It's gone.

21:25.064 --> 21:26.565
The ghost giveth and taketh away.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.000
Just enough to keep them running.

21:33.306 --> 21:35.607
This ghost is not going to stop.

21:35.675 --> 21:37.442
It's only a matter of time before
the police are after them again.

21:37.510 --> 21:38.710
Then they'll run.

21:38.778 --> 21:40.846
Yeah, but then they'll
be leaving the one town

21:40.913 --> 21:42.014
Where someone can talk to their ghost.

21:42.081 --> 21:43.215
Maybe end all this.

21:43.283 --> 21:45.017
They're not going to get another chance.

21:53.693 --> 21:54.826
Hey, ned!

21:54.894 --> 21:56.361
Did you get tickets to the movie?

21:56.429 --> 21:58.397
Yeah. Great, let's go.

21:58.464 --> 21:59.898
Can we talk first?

21:59.966 --> 22:02.234
ned, please...

22:02.302 --> 22:03.769
Look, believe me,

22:03.836 --> 22:05.137
"can we talk" is like the last thing

22:05.204 --> 22:06.571
That I say to girls.

22:06.639 --> 22:08.874
I'm sure you've heard it plenty of times.

22:08.941 --> 22:12.444
Anyways, here's the thing--

22:12.512 --> 22:14.746
I like you.

22:14.814 --> 22:17.649
I like you, too.

22:17.717 --> 22:21.286
Good. Glad we got that squared away.

22:21.354 --> 22:24.189
Also, I don't want you to move.

22:24.257 --> 22:26.391
I don't want to, either.

22:26.459 --> 22:28.660
But my father's job-- don't.

22:28.728 --> 22:30.696
Just stop, ok?

22:30.763 --> 22:33.832
Please, hear me out before you say anything.

22:33.900 --> 22:37.402
What I mean is, what if
you didn't have to move?

22:37.470 --> 22:39.037
Wherever you wanted to stay,

22:39.105 --> 22:41.073
You could. What if there was a way?

22:41.140 --> 22:42.474
It's just...

22:42.542 --> 22:44.376
It's not that simple.

22:44.444 --> 22:47.579
I'm not saying it wouldn't cost anything.

22:47.647 --> 22:49.214
I know you love your brother and
I know you want to protect him.

22:49.282 --> 22:51.049
Wait, my brother?

22:51.117 --> 22:52.384
What does he have to do with anything?

22:52.452 --> 22:56.555
If he hurt somebody,
he needs to be responsible for that.

22:56.622 --> 22:58.657
Or else he's hurting you,
he's hurting all of you.

22:58.725 --> 22:59.891
And I think he sees that.

22:59.959 --> 23:01.360
Wait, wait, wait,
what are you accusing him of?

23:01.427 --> 23:03.528
What are you saying?

23:03.596 --> 23:05.564
Is someone asking questions
about my brother, about us?

23:05.631 --> 23:07.666
I know what it's like to have a secret.

23:09.135 --> 23:11.036
I have one, too.

23:11.104 --> 23:12.704
My friend melinda...

23:12.772 --> 23:14.906
She sees ghosts.

23:14.974 --> 23:17.943
And there is a really angry guy

23:18.010 --> 23:19.778
Haunting your family.

23:19.846 --> 23:21.446
We think it's some kind of payback

23:21.514 --> 23:22.581
For what mike did to the girl.

23:23.916 --> 23:26.251
You and your friend...

23:26.319 --> 23:29.588
Have you gone to the cops about this?

23:31.491 --> 23:32.557
Yes.

23:34.260 --> 23:37.295
But we can help you if-
-if you just tell me what's going on.

23:37.363 --> 23:39.431
It's not my decision to make.

23:39.499 --> 23:42.100
It's my family.

23:42.168 --> 23:44.269
I could lose them forever.

23:44.337 --> 23:46.104
You can't keep running,

23:46.172 --> 23:47.305
At least not from this ghost.

23:47.373 --> 23:50.542
we have to.

24:06.893 --> 24:09.294
Katie...

24:11.964 --> 24:14.299
Rachel.

24:14.367 --> 24:18.136
My name is rachel.

24:24.210 --> 24:26.511
Well, their last name is blessing.

24:26.579 --> 24:29.147
Glen and his wife belong to the green front,

24:29.215 --> 24:30.449
An environmental activist group.

24:30.516 --> 24:32.451
Their last big stand was 12 years ago.

24:32.518 --> 24:33.718
After that, the blessings went underground

24:33.786 --> 24:35.454
And the group disbanded.

24:35.521 --> 24:36.788
What were they protesting?

24:36.856 --> 24:38.156
A housing development being built

24:38.224 --> 24:39.524
On endangered wetlands.

24:39.592 --> 24:40.992
There were at least a dozen attacks--

24:41.060 --> 24:43.829
Vandalism, trespassing,
destruction of property.

24:43.896 --> 24:45.230
Where did all this happen?

24:45.298 --> 24:47.399
Believe it or not, mostly
right here in driscoll county.

24:47.467 --> 24:49.434
So they lived here before?

24:49.502 --> 24:50.635
And they lied about it.

24:50.703 --> 24:52.938
Why risk coming back?

24:53.005 --> 24:54.606
Well, it's not unusual for
fugitives to be drawn back.

24:54.674 --> 24:56.441
Lots of things, like friends or family

24:56.509 --> 24:57.976
Or nostalgia for their old life.

24:58.044 --> 24:59.845
But there's something I just don't get.

24:59.912 --> 25:03.215
Would the fbi really track
somebody down for a decade

25:03.282 --> 25:05.350
Because they trashed a construction site?

25:05.418 --> 25:06.852
Well, during that final attack,

25:06.919 --> 25:08.086
A security guard was killed,

25:08.154 --> 25:09.287
Probably trying to stop them.

25:09.355 --> 25:10.489
What was his name?

25:10.556 --> 25:11.656
Trevor marshall.

25:11.724 --> 25:14.259
That explains the ghost in uniform.

25:14.327 --> 25:16.194
Well, now we know who they are,

25:16.262 --> 25:18.797
So we're going to put out
an apb and find them.

25:19.999 --> 25:22.067
The name rachel--

25:22.134 --> 25:23.401
Without it, we'd be nowhere.

25:23.469 --> 25:25.270
Did a ghost give it to you?

26:24.196 --> 26:25.997
Come on, let's go!

26:26.065 --> 26:27.766
Now!

26:38.778 --> 26:40.645
Police! Warrant!

26:43.316 --> 26:46.751
Detective blair: Are we covered in back?

26:46.819 --> 26:48.019
All covered.

26:48.087 --> 26:49.120
Break it down!

26:51.557 --> 26:53.992
Quickly, quickly!

26:55.861 --> 26:57.495
Clear.

26:57.563 --> 26:58.830
Move, move! Clear. All clear upstairs.

26:58.898 --> 27:00.699
Clear!

27:00.766 --> 27:01.800
Clear in back, let's move out.

27:01.867 --> 27:02.834
Clear!

27:02.902 --> 27:04.903
They couldn't have gone far!

27:13.595 --> 27:14.695
Gordon, can you take this? Ok, detective.

27:15.696 --> 27:17.196
That's katie's dance bag.

27:17.962 --> 27:19.396
They left everything.

27:19.464 --> 27:20.998
Well, I think they had a short lead.

27:21.066 --> 27:22.299
There's coffee brewing in the kitchen, so...

27:22.367 --> 27:24.168
So what happens now?

27:24.235 --> 27:25.202
They won't get far.

27:25.270 --> 27:26.970
You did a good thing.

27:28.339 --> 27:30.774
Doesn't feel that way.

27:33.911 --> 27:36.146
Seeing ned so upset got me
thinking about katie's family.

27:36.214 --> 27:38.682
It was a huge risk,
them coming back to grandview.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.117
Which didn't make any sense

27:40.185 --> 27:41.885
Until I thought about what
detective blair had said.

27:41.953 --> 27:44.054
About nostalgia for the scene of the crime?

27:44.122 --> 27:45.456
Visiting loved ones.

27:45.523 --> 27:47.391
I remember seeing dave and
diane leaving the hospital.

27:47.459 --> 27:49.326
Do you think they were visiting family?

27:49.394 --> 27:50.961
Yes, but not their's.

27:51.029 --> 27:52.329
Wait, I'm lost.

27:52.397 --> 27:53.797
I asked jim to check the records

27:53.865 --> 27:55.265
To see if there were any
employees or patients

27:55.333 --> 27:56.867
Who might have their real name,

27:56.935 --> 27:58.302
Or any of their aliases.

27:58.369 --> 27:59.903
And did he find anything?

27:59.971 --> 28:02.406
No, but found a patient with the
ghost's last name, marshall.

28:02.474 --> 28:03.707
Connie marshall.

28:03.775 --> 28:04.975
She's trevor's mom.

28:05.043 --> 28:06.844
Hey, guys. Sorry. I was going to call you,

28:06.911 --> 28:08.512
But you're not going to
find her in her room.

28:08.580 --> 28:10.581
She died the day before yesterday.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.116
And the nurses were telling me

28:12.183 --> 28:13.350
There's a couple that's
been visiting recently,

28:13.418 --> 28:15.285
Sounds a lot like the walkers.

28:15.353 --> 28:17.521
Ok, I'm really lost.

28:17.589 --> 28:20.023
I know someone who has the answers.

28:29.467 --> 28:32.202
Try another channel. Ok.

28:32.270 --> 28:33.704
I don't get you.

28:33.771 --> 28:35.439
You didn't have to come.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.674
Why didn't you stay?

28:37.742 --> 28:40.744
Because I would never see you guys again.

28:40.812 --> 28:42.412
He seemed like a nice guy.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.047
Stop it.

28:44.115 --> 28:45.349
Did you make him hate you?

28:45.416 --> 28:47.618
Mike, don't.

28:47.685 --> 28:48.752
That's my favorite trick.

28:48.820 --> 28:50.587
No!

28:50.655 --> 28:51.822
That's why I did to lydia.

28:51.890 --> 28:53.323
Just shut up. Aah! Mike!

28:53.391 --> 28:54.925
Mike, what are you doing?!

28:56.194 --> 28:59.563
This meant we're together. We're not!

28:59.631 --> 29:01.765
Mike, mike, wait! It's over, lydia.

29:01.833 --> 29:05.335
Mike, you're-- you're acting
like somebody I don't even know!

29:05.403 --> 29:08.005
Who are you?

29:08.072 --> 29:10.440
Mike, wait! No, please!

29:12.877 --> 29:15.279
Oh, my god, please!

29:15.346 --> 29:18.649
Please!

29:18.716 --> 29:20.951
So we can just keep doing this.

29:21.019 --> 29:23.187
Just me, you,

29:23.254 --> 29:25.355
Dad and mom and whatever we can grab

29:25.423 --> 29:26.857
Before we run out the door.

29:26.925 --> 29:29.193
Don't you want a life? Shh! Guys.

29:29.260 --> 29:31.094
What did they just say?

29:31.162 --> 29:33.397
They're calling all units in the vicinity.

29:33.464 --> 29:36.033
How do they know?

29:39.437 --> 29:41.572
they got a tip.

29:43.942 --> 29:46.743
You told that boy everything, didn't you?

29:46.811 --> 29:51.014
He already knew...A lot.

29:51.082 --> 29:52.416
He has a friend.

29:52.483 --> 29:55.552
She sees ghosts.

29:55.620 --> 29:59.122
It's trevor. I knew it.

29:59.190 --> 30:00.457
All of these years-- not now!

30:00.525 --> 30:02.326
He's been haunting us! Diane, please!

30:02.393 --> 30:05.229
Ned said trevor was angry. He said something

30:05.296 --> 30:06.463
About payback. Oh, god

30:06.531 --> 30:08.565
Why is he doing this?

30:08.633 --> 30:10.067
Diane, stop it!

30:10.134 --> 30:13.837
Dad, mom, what happened to that guy?!

30:13.905 --> 30:15.105
Tell us!

30:15.173 --> 30:16.840
You know the rules.

30:16.908 --> 30:18.508
No questions.

30:18.576 --> 30:19.843
The less you know, the better.

30:19.911 --> 30:21.878
But you want us to believe

30:21.946 --> 30:23.280
What we read about you on the internet?

30:23.348 --> 30:26.083
That you're basically terrorists, murderers?

30:26.150 --> 30:28.051
We're not. You know that.

30:28.119 --> 30:29.286
Look, I'm sorry.

30:29.354 --> 30:32.122
Your mother and I never
meant it to be this way.

30:32.190 --> 30:35.626
We just wanted us all to stay together.

30:54.512 --> 30:55.679
Trevor...

30:55.747 --> 30:57.314
Does he really think he
can make his guilt go away

30:57.382 --> 30:58.515
By visiting my mom?

30:58.583 --> 31:01.184
After everything he did,
the way he betrayed me?

31:01.252 --> 31:03.086
betrayed you?

31:05.256 --> 31:08.025
He was like a big brother to me.

31:08.092 --> 31:10.394
The only reason I got a job at that site

31:10.461 --> 31:11.762
Was so we could take it out.

31:11.829 --> 31:14.431
We joined green fund together.

31:14.499 --> 31:15.799
We were ready to give it everything.

31:15.867 --> 31:18.068
Or at least I was.

31:20.138 --> 31:22.839
We hit them in their wallet
to get their attention.

31:22.907 --> 31:24.007
Glen, sugar.

31:24.075 --> 31:26.710
Burned out the engines by pouring sugar.

31:26.778 --> 31:29.613
But I knew, to really hurt them,

31:29.681 --> 31:31.715
We had to go further.

31:31.783 --> 31:33.283
Then I saw something I couldn't pass up.

31:33.351 --> 31:34.751
Glen! Yeah?

31:34.819 --> 31:37.721
All we have to do is point
this tractor down the hill

31:37.789 --> 31:38.822
And get the hell out of the way.

31:38.890 --> 31:40.090
Once this rig hits the propane tanks--

31:40.158 --> 31:41.658
Yeah, the whole place will blow up.

31:41.726 --> 31:44.227
Don't you want people thinking
about what they're doing?

31:44.295 --> 31:46.463
Trevor, I want them thinking
that the enemy is this project,

31:46.531 --> 31:48.298
Not us!

31:48.366 --> 31:49.366
Oh, come on, man!

31:49.434 --> 31:50.734
Don't do that!

31:50.802 --> 31:52.302
Well, either help me or get
the hell out of my way.

31:52.370 --> 31:54.905
Hey, stop acting like an idiot, ok?

31:54.972 --> 31:56.306
Now let's go!

31:56.374 --> 31:59.042
If you're going to walk, just walk.

32:06.517 --> 32:09.353
I thought if I could just get it started,

32:09.420 --> 32:11.121
Point it in the right direction...

32:13.391 --> 32:16.026
But it was a two-man job.

32:29.340 --> 32:31.708
Aah!

32:31.776 --> 32:33.643
Glen!

32:34.979 --> 32:37.481
Glen...Glen!

32:37.548 --> 32:40.484
I screamed out for glen to help me.

32:40.551 --> 32:41.985
Glen, you gotta help me!

32:42.053 --> 32:43.653
Pull me out of there.

32:43.721 --> 32:45.155
But he ran. I was hurt and he left me
in the mud. He left me there to die.

32:45.223 --> 32:48.125
Glen, don't go!

32:48.192 --> 32:50.060
Glen!

32:50.128 --> 32:53.296
By the time the cops found me, I was dead.

32:53.364 --> 32:55.465
He ran from our cause,

32:55.533 --> 32:57.968
And he ran from me.

32:59.137 --> 33:02.038
And you made sure he never stopped running.

33:07.879 --> 33:09.012
Ok, everybody.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.514
Just stay calm.

33:10.581 --> 33:12.516
Dad! It's ok, sweetie.

33:12.583 --> 33:15.285
You know what to do.

33:15.353 --> 33:16.653
Everyone remain in the vehicle.

33:16.721 --> 33:19.523
Remain seated in the vehicle.

33:19.590 --> 33:21.758
Dad?

33:23.094 --> 33:25.162
Dave, don't. Don't.

33:25.229 --> 33:27.164
Protect the family.

33:27.231 --> 33:28.765
Stay together.

33:28.833 --> 33:31.001
That's all that matters.

33:31.068 --> 33:32.002
Sir, stay in the vehicle!

33:32.069 --> 33:33.103
Is there a problem, officer?

33:33.171 --> 33:35.806
Put your hands in the air, now!

33:35.873 --> 33:37.841
I'm unarmed. I told you to stay in the van!

33:37.909 --> 33:39.109
Is there a problem?

33:39.177 --> 33:40.677
Don't move. I'm not moving.

33:40.745 --> 33:42.546
Is there a problem?

33:42.613 --> 33:43.880
something wrong?

33:43.948 --> 33:45.115
You in the car, don't move!
Nothing to worry about.

33:45.183 --> 33:46.716
Mom!

33:46.784 --> 33:47.717
Don't point that gun at my hands!

33:47.785 --> 33:49.586
Hands where I can see them.

33:49.654 --> 33:51.354
Where are you going?! What are you doing?

33:51.422 --> 33:52.856
Don't shoot. Hands in the air!

33:52.924 --> 33:54.791
On the ground! Get on the ground, now!

33:54.859 --> 33:57.394
Get back in the car! Get back in the car!

33:59.363 --> 34:01.665
It's ok, officer. Get on the ground!

34:01.732 --> 34:02.899
On your knees! Don't shoot!

34:02.967 --> 34:04.367
it's all right.

34:04.435 --> 34:05.836
Drive, katie, go!

34:05.903 --> 34:07.471
Hands in the air, on your knees, now!

34:07.538 --> 34:09.206
No! No! No! No, no, no!

34:09.273 --> 34:10.440
Don't--please don't shoot!

34:10.507 --> 34:12.208
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

34:12.275 --> 34:14.511
Please! Out of the car, now!

34:14.579 --> 34:17.214
Now! Now!

34:23.259 --> 34:24.359
They haven't done anything!

34:24.427 --> 34:26.128
They're kids! Those are my children!

34:26.196 --> 34:27.896
They are innocent! Out of the vehicle!

34:27.964 --> 34:29.264
Do not shoot!

34:29.331 --> 34:31.266
Katie, dad wants you to go!
Why aren't you going?!

34:31.333 --> 34:32.734
Do you hear me? Now!

34:32.802 --> 34:34.303
Don't!

34:34.370 --> 34:37.005
Turn it off!

34:38.808 --> 34:40.275
Throw the keys out and exit the van!

34:47.951 --> 34:49.117
Hands in the air... Slowly.

34:52.789 --> 34:54.956
On your knees.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.962
Everyone on your knees,
hands behind your head.

35:00.029 --> 35:02.364
Why did you give up?

35:02.432 --> 35:03.699
We had a plan!

35:03.766 --> 35:06.468
I can't, daddy. I'm sorry. I just...

35:06.536 --> 35:09.004
I can't run anymore.

35:14.878 --> 35:16.745
All of you on your knees, hands behind
your head, interlock your fingers.

35:16.813 --> 35:19.815
She's right.

35:19.883 --> 35:21.049
She's right.

35:21.117 --> 35:22.851
It's going to be ok, baby.

35:22.919 --> 35:23.886
It's ok.

35:26.623 --> 35:28.357
Please, sir, on your knees, all of you.

35:46.175 --> 35:47.776
Roger, they're in route.

35:53.650 --> 35:55.484
Be brave for your mom, ok?

35:55.552 --> 35:57.319
Stay together.

35:57.387 --> 35:58.654
I'll see you soon.

35:58.721 --> 36:00.188
I am so sorry, daddy!

36:00.256 --> 36:02.791
No, no, I am.

36:02.859 --> 36:04.159
I love you, baby.

36:04.227 --> 36:05.494
Sir, come with me, watch your step.

36:05.562 --> 36:07.262
I love you, too.

36:07.330 --> 36:09.164
Excuse me, detective blair,

36:09.232 --> 36:10.432
I know that it's a lot to ask,

36:10.500 --> 36:12.234
But can I have five
minutes with mr. Blessing?

36:12.302 --> 36:13.902
He's just been arrested for murder.

36:13.970 --> 36:15.070
Yeah, I know.

36:15.138 --> 36:16.505
But there's something I have to ask him.

36:16.573 --> 36:18.507
Don't tell me-- you've got
a message from a ghost?

36:18.575 --> 36:21.143
No, from my husband,
but I think it could be important.

36:21.210 --> 36:25.113
I think I can prove that
he didn't kill anyone.

36:26.115 --> 36:28.216
Don't you want to know the truth?

36:30.987 --> 36:32.220
Come on.

36:33.423 --> 36:35.190
Ok, just tell me what happened.

36:35.258 --> 36:36.858
Well, if you talk to ghosts,

36:36.926 --> 36:38.327
You should already know.

36:38.394 --> 36:40.562
trevor told me what he remembers.

36:40.630 --> 36:42.698
Why don't you give me
your side of the story?

36:46.202 --> 36:49.137
The truth is, I try not to remember it.

36:49.205 --> 36:50.672
It was the worst day of my life.

36:50.740 --> 36:53.175
Worse than seeing your family
being taken away from you?

36:53.242 --> 36:55.210
I'm going to see my family again someday.

36:55.278 --> 36:58.180
Trevor, I'll never see.

36:58.247 --> 37:00.148
You still care that much about him?

37:00.216 --> 37:02.684
Even though he had your family
on the run for all those years?

37:02.752 --> 37:04.553
Trevor was a good man

37:04.621 --> 37:07.522
Who lost his life trying
to make the world better.

37:07.590 --> 37:09.524
He blames me for that, and who knows?

37:09.592 --> 37:11.393
Maybe he's right. Maybe?

37:11.461 --> 37:13.996
I never should have let
him hang back that night.

37:14.063 --> 37:16.431
Neither of us knew how to
drive that kind of machine.

37:16.499 --> 37:17.899
That's what he regrets?

37:17.967 --> 37:21.103
What about leaving me there to die?

37:21.170 --> 37:23.639
He wants to know why you
left him there to die.

37:25.208 --> 37:26.975
Trevor's here?

37:28.478 --> 37:30.245
How can he think I left him there to die?

37:30.313 --> 37:32.581
That's crazy. He was my friend.

37:32.649 --> 37:34.616
That's just what he remembers.

37:34.684 --> 37:35.951
He doesn't know what we know.

37:36.019 --> 37:37.252
What are you talking about?

37:37.320 --> 37:39.621
Trevor, my husband...

37:40.923 --> 37:43.125
He saw your autopsy report.
You died instantly

37:43.192 --> 37:45.794
From the fall. But that's not possible.

37:45.862 --> 37:49.197
I called his name, that's why he came back.

37:49.265 --> 37:52.034
Aah!

37:54.103 --> 37:55.871
I ran, but I stopped.

37:55.938 --> 37:58.106
I just couldn't leave him there,
he was my friend.

38:00.443 --> 38:03.078
Trevor!

38:15.024 --> 38:16.825
oh, my god, trevor!

38:16.893 --> 38:20.095
He came back for you
because he's your friend.

38:21.564 --> 38:22.764
But by the time he got to you,

38:22.832 --> 38:23.999
He couldn't hear your voice;

38:24.067 --> 38:26.501
Not any more than he can now.

38:26.569 --> 38:27.803
What's he saying?

38:29.205 --> 38:32.407
He's trying to understand.

38:32.475 --> 38:34.743
I punished him all those years.

38:34.811 --> 38:37.245
And he never did anything wrong.

38:37.313 --> 38:40.449
He feels guilty for haunting
you and your family.

38:40.516 --> 38:41.917
After all he did for my mom.

38:41.984 --> 38:44.019
I thought he was just working off his shame.

38:44.087 --> 38:45.821
I should have known better.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.422
Family was everything to him.

38:47.490 --> 38:49.124
He was just trying to make sure

38:49.192 --> 38:50.592
My mom had a family, too.

38:50.660 --> 38:52.627
He knows why you came back,

38:52.695 --> 38:54.396
And what you did for his mother.

38:54.464 --> 38:56.598
She lost a son.

38:56.666 --> 38:58.667
That was punishment enough.

38:58.735 --> 39:00.035
Punishment?

39:00.103 --> 39:03.238
She knew what we were up to.
She gave me money.

39:03.306 --> 39:05.407
Gave people from the
movement a place to stay.

39:05.475 --> 39:07.909
So she could have gone to jail.

39:07.977 --> 39:09.911
Yeah.

39:09.979 --> 39:11.146
My wife, too.

39:11.214 --> 39:13.248
We were all involved in the movement.

39:13.316 --> 39:15.951
My family would have been torn apart.

39:16.018 --> 39:17.953
I couldn't face that.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.788
We never thought it through.

39:19.856 --> 39:21.490
We just ran.

39:21.557 --> 39:24.192
And once we did, we couldn't stop.

39:24.260 --> 39:27.028
Tell trevor not to feel guilty.

39:27.096 --> 39:30.265
I'm alive!

39:30.333 --> 39:31.600
I have everything.

39:31.667 --> 39:32.768
Not if they take it away.

39:32.835 --> 39:36.037
They want to put him in prison for my death.

39:36.105 --> 39:37.472
We can't let them do that.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.040
What's he saying now?

39:39.108 --> 39:42.210
I kept a box, all my letters
to glen and the others,

39:42.278 --> 39:43.879
They're hidden in my mother's attic.

39:43.946 --> 39:47.749
I was so full of myself, I thought
that they could help some historian

39:47.817 --> 39:50.018
Write about my cause someday.

39:50.086 --> 39:51.219
Maybe now they can help glen.

39:51.287 --> 39:52.320
He hid letters

39:52.388 --> 39:53.755
That he wrote about what you two did.

39:53.823 --> 39:55.423
If they read those letters,

39:55.491 --> 39:56.458
They'll know that I was involved,

39:56.526 --> 39:58.260
That I was the hot-head, not him.

40:00.663 --> 40:02.531
And please call him glen.

40:02.598 --> 40:05.133
That's who he is again.

40:06.435 --> 40:08.069
He wants you to take your name back,

40:08.137 --> 40:10.872
And your life back.

40:10.940 --> 40:14.242
And he says it's nice to
see a really old friend.

40:20.283 --> 40:22.150
I see it.

40:23.920 --> 40:26.087
My mom.

40:26.155 --> 40:29.057
She's waiting for me.

40:29.125 --> 40:32.227
Then go and be with her.

40:34.664 --> 40:37.365
Tell glen he was always right

40:37.433 --> 40:39.000
About family.

40:40.937 --> 40:42.938
I can see that now.

40:44.106 --> 40:45.874
I will.

40:56.185 --> 40:58.587
He's gone.

41:22.278 --> 41:24.179
Detective blair said they
dropped the murder charges

41:24.247 --> 41:25.780
Because of the ghost's letters.

41:25.848 --> 41:27.949
Katie said her dad still had to stand trial.

41:28.017 --> 41:29.284
Yeah, that's because of the
vandalism and the running.

41:29.352 --> 41:31.253
But the mom won't be prosecuted.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.721
Oh, I know ned's happy about that.

41:32.788 --> 41:34.522
And she signed a one-year lease,

41:34.590 --> 41:36.091
So she'll be sticking around for a while.

41:36.158 --> 41:37.993
So you think it's the real thing?

41:38.060 --> 41:39.294
Oh, god, who knows?

41:39.362 --> 41:40.462
They're still kids.

41:40.529 --> 41:41.630
I'm not going to be knitting baby booties

41:41.697 --> 41:42.831
Any time soon.

41:42.899 --> 41:45.500
But whatever happens,
I'm really proud of him.

41:45.568 --> 41:47.936
I think he made some good choices.

41:48.004 --> 41:49.804
Who made good choices?

41:49.872 --> 41:51.072
Um, I did.

41:51.140 --> 41:53.508
I got a hazelnut mocha double latte,

41:53.576 --> 41:55.410
And it's so good, so good.

41:55.478 --> 41:57.345
That's fine. I don't need your kudos.

41:57.413 --> 41:59.114
Katie's brother has given me plenty.

41:59.181 --> 42:01.516
Ned helped him get up the
courage to call lydia,

42:01.584 --> 42:02.717
The girl he chased away.

42:02.785 --> 42:04.686
And she called him back.

42:04.754 --> 42:06.688
So we'll see.

42:08.557 --> 42:10.125
That's so cute!

42:10.192 --> 42:11.893
Please, don't make me look.

42:13.229 --> 42:14.396
Oh, my god!

42:14.463 --> 42:15.497
Oh, young.
