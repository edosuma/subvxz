00:07.720 --> 00:10.120
Good morning.
You must be Steven Toast.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.200
How are you today?
I'm fine, thanks.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.160
And I trust you're well?
Amazing.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.880
Another Canadian.
You guys are taking over this town.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.160
I'm not Canadian.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.720
Hold your horses.
Is that Scramble Studios in London?

00:26.120 --> 00:29.080
Yeah, Scramble is one of our
sister studios.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.320
We've got studios
all over the world.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.520
Is that right?

00:32.520 --> 00:35.480
Sure. I'm due to fly out
to the London studio next month

00:35.480 --> 00:37.840
as part of our
staff exchange scheme.

00:37.840 --> 00:42.560
I can't wait. I'm super-excited,
it's going to be so super-cool.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.680
Sounds fascinating.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.000
Hey, do you know Donald Sutherland?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.560
Isn't he Canadian?

00:48.560 --> 00:49.760
Is he single?

00:49.760 --> 00:51.560
I've no idea.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.360
He's a bit old for you, isn't he?

00:53.360 --> 00:55.760
Hey, if Daddy can raise the bridge,

00:55.760 --> 00:57.840
then Mama's river be flowing.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.600
Good grief.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.720
Erm, I'm due to record,
and I'm guessing it's through there.

01:05.720 --> 01:09.000
Sure. Studio one.
Go right in. They're ready for you.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.440
Thanking you.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.000
Would you mind if I raised
this microphone?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Make yourself comfortable, Steven.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.560
Hello, Steven, this is
Clem Fandango. Welcome to LA.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.040
Of all the recording studios
in the world,

02:06.040 --> 02:09.240
I end up in the same one
as you two clowns.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.720
Is it always this hot?

02:10.720 --> 02:13.080
I mean, I'm going to pass out
in here.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.440
Got to say,
I kind of like the heat, man.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.360
Always wanted to live out here
in LA.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.960
<i>Man? </i>You've only been here
ten minutes, you idiot.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.480
But this is too hot.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.800
Hi, Steven, this is Clem Fandango.
Can you hear me?

02:24.800 --> 02:25.840
Yes, unfortunately.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.600
I'm afraid the air-con in the
vocal booth broke down last night.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.720
Oh! Means it's 27 degrees hotter
in there than it is in here.

02:31.720 --> 02:32.960
Oh, God!

02:32.960 --> 02:35.560
Also bad timing, I'm afraid,
Steven, it's the hottest day

02:35.560 --> 02:38.080
there's ever been in LA.
Oh, for God's sake!

02:38.080 --> 02:39.880
Don't you just love it?

02:39.880 --> 02:42.120
No. All right, let's crack on.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.520
The quicker we finish this,
the sooner I can get out of this oven.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.720
OK, Steven, pepper spray,
take one.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.720
Fed up with people
knocking at your door?

02:52.720 --> 02:57.000
Well, one sharp burst of Corden's
pepper spray will make anyone

02:57.000 --> 02:59.160
think twice about ringing your bell.

02:59.160 --> 03:03.440
Corden's criminal deterrents...
America's favourite pepper spray.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.240
Perfect. That was great, Steven,
real swell.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.800
We'll shoot that over to the client,
see what gives.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.360
What is this snake oil?

03:15.480 --> 03:17.080
Corden's pepper spray.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.320
Huh.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.840
Wonder what could have caused that.
Must be the heat.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.040
Mm.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.960
Get...me...out.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.760
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

03:39.760 --> 03:42.600
<i>Look at Russ Nightlife.
Who is he?</i>

03:42.600 --> 03:46.400
<i>He's a grown man doing a jigsaw
puzzle like some geriatric</i>

03:46.400 --> 03:49.880
<i>in a care home.
Definitely an odd fish.</i>

03:49.880 --> 03:51.400
<i>And I should know.</i>

03:51.400 --> 03:54.000
<i>I've swum with a few in MY time.</i>

03:54.000 --> 03:59.480
<i>What a loser. I hope I never end up
like thatâ€”sad, lonely,</i>

03:59.480 --> 04:03.360
<i>without hope, pathetically
assembling a ludicrous jigsaw</i>

04:03.360 --> 04:06.120
<i>just to pass the endless hours.</i>

04:06.120 --> 04:08.760
You know,
I could read your thoughts.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.720
What?! You're thinking about sex.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.440
I'm not, actually.
I'm meeting a friend tonight.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.600
I was thinking
about booking a restaurant.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.400
A friend?
Yes.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.000
What, like a lady friend?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.360
Yes.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.600
Well, I'm telling you now,
don't ever bring her back here,

04:28.600 --> 04:31.400
I can't have anyone just sniffing
around the joint, all right?

04:31.400 --> 04:32.800
All right.

04:39.760 --> 04:42.360
Are you planning
to have sex with her?

04:42.360 --> 04:48.240
What? The thought of you having sex
under my roof disgusts me.

04:48.240 --> 04:51.200
It's a stupid question anyway.
I mean, look at you.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.400
I beg your pardon?
If you do have sex with her,

04:55.400 --> 04:58.720
I want you to inject yourself
with a millilitre of this.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.080
Do what?!

05:00.080 --> 05:01.920
It doesn't hurt. Look.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.200
Ugh! Aghhh!

05:16.960 --> 05:18.880
What the hell?

05:18.880 --> 05:20.760
Jesus Christ, man!

05:24.200 --> 05:26.320
Toast, I'm joking.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.760
Oh, you need to
lighten up a little, man.

05:34.760 --> 05:35.840
Oh!

05:39.080 --> 05:40.760
Jesus Christ.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.120
Easing it in... slowly.

05:45.120 --> 05:48.680
And now a persistent
rhythmic movement.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.160
Oh, yes.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.800
In an accelerating motion.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.120
Oh, God.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.480
Quickly followed by a...
rapid emission.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.840
Good God!

05:59.200 --> 06:00.520
Oh!

06:00.520 --> 06:05.200
The act was completed in
pretty much the same time period

06:05.200 --> 06:06.640
as the previous procedure

06:06.640 --> 06:10.280
last Tuesday,
3 minutes and 28 seconds.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.720
It's all a bit...

06:12.720 --> 06:15.760
A bit what?
A bit clinical, isn't it?

06:15.760 --> 06:17.920
But I am a clinical sexologist.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.400
Yeah, but do you need to make notes
while we're actually making love?

06:21.400 --> 06:25.000
Oh, yes. It's very important
to make notes during the procedure

06:25.000 --> 06:26.920
rather than having to rely
on memory.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.120
And even the word <i>procedure...
</i>it's not very romantic, is it?

06:30.120 --> 06:35.200
<i>Romantic </i>is not a word
easily defined in scientific terms.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.120
This IS a relationship, isn't it?
Just to be clear.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.560
Oh, yes.

06:39.560 --> 06:43.600
I draw a very clear distinction
between sex with you

06:43.600 --> 06:47.120
and sex with people I'm sleeping
with for research purposes.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.280
Glad to hear it.

06:51.280 --> 06:55.920
Except, in this case, when it kills
two birds with one stone,

06:55.920 --> 06:57.800
as you Brits like to say.

07:01.960 --> 07:05.440
Shepherd, there's another man
in bed with us.

07:05.440 --> 07:09.840
Yes, he's a fellow professor
accompanying me on field work.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.920
Does he have to be here?

07:11.920 --> 07:15.240
Professor Map? Yes. Yes, he does.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.720
Right.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.800
It's rather taken me by surprise
seeing him in bed here with us.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.800
Very well. Professor Map...

07:23.800 --> 07:28.000
Wurde es Ihnen etwas ausmachen,
uns bitte zu verlassen?

07:35.280 --> 07:38.320
It's only 11.30.
What say we go for a walk?

07:38.320 --> 07:39.840
We can stop at a cafe.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.120
You fancy a cappuccino bianco
in the shade?

07:43.120 --> 07:44.960
Or maybe a cocktail at high noon?

07:44.960 --> 07:46.920
I can't.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.920
I have to go
and have sex with someone else.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.560
How many other men are you having
sex with on this project?

07:52.560 --> 07:54.080
Oh, I would say somewhere in the...

07:54.080 --> 07:57.160
Oh! Goddamn it!

07:57.160 --> 07:59.800
I really have to
get these organised.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.320
What are they?
Score cards.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.840
You give scores for performance?

08:04.840 --> 08:07.480
I'm guessing I'd be
in the higher points bracket.

08:07.480 --> 08:11.040
Oh, I haven't filled out
your score card yet, Toast.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.880
I only do that when I've completed
a full assessment

08:13.880 --> 08:15.400
of the participants' performance.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.120
Yeah, but I'm guessing I'd be
pretty up there, wouldn't you say?

08:18.120 --> 08:21.120
I'm sorry, Toast.
That's confidential information.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.480
Oh-ho-ha!

08:23.560 --> 08:26.320
I really need to get
this shit together.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.400
Maybe my daughter could do it.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.560
I must admit,
I'm very fond of you, Shepherd,

08:31.560 --> 08:34.240
so it's only natural
that I should be slightly jealous,

08:34.240 --> 08:37.800
seeing as you're sleeping with
literally dozens, if not hundreds,

08:37.800 --> 08:40.240
of other men, including me.

08:40.240 --> 08:43.080
But as long as I know
that I'm the special one,

08:43.080 --> 08:44.640
then I'm absolutely...

08:44.640 --> 08:47.120
...fine with it.
You sure you're fine with it?

08:47.120 --> 08:50.040
Sounds a little goddamn weird to me.

08:50.040 --> 08:52.520
You couldn't be more wrong,
Hooberman.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.680
She's a professional psychologist,

08:54.680 --> 08:58.920
perfectly capable of distinguishing
between business and pleasure.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.040
They're business, I'm pleasure.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.640
Who's that fella?

09:04.640 --> 09:09.360
Sonny-Sam Dysco, they say he's going
to be the next goddamn big thing.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.280
He's got a whole billboard
to himself.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.720
Wouldn't mind a slice
of that action myself.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.840
Anything juicy coming up for me?

09:15.840 --> 09:18.880
How would you like to play
another butler?

09:18.880 --> 09:20.240
I'd hate that.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.440
Weech Beacon needs a butler.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.280
He's about to make a huge
goddamn movie,

09:25.280 --> 09:28.800
so the dollars will be a plenty,
Daddy-o.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.880
Weech Beacon?

09:30.880 --> 09:35.400
Weech Beacon, talented director,
also a major league asshole.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.520
I've never heard of that league.
Sounds prestigious.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.040
Well, if he likes the look of you,

09:40.040 --> 09:42.520
he'll probably offer you the job
on the spot.

09:42.520 --> 09:45.240
He's pretty impulsive that way.
You want to meet him?

09:45.240 --> 09:48.760
Well, if the dollars are plenty,
Mummy-o, why not?

09:48.760 --> 09:50.000
I'll text him.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.280
He's probably at The Dive.
He hangs out there all the time.

09:53.280 --> 09:57.080
The Dive? They tell me
it's the hippest bar in town

09:57.080 --> 10:02.120
but, hell, my ass is as old as time,
so what would I goddamn know?

10:04.760 --> 10:07.760
Oh, we're pretty damn close.
I'll text him now.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.960
Asshole!

10:50.440 --> 10:53.440
Like I said, Red's on board.
Are you sure?

10:53.440 --> 10:56.440
He might even bring Jen with him.
Who knows? Sure?

10:56.440 --> 10:58.280
Relax, baby.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.360
The chicken's in the basket, huh?

11:00.360 --> 11:01.720
Chicken's in the basket.

11:01.720 --> 11:05.480
Are you Toast?
I'm Steven Toast. Good afternoon.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.960
You came in costume. I like that.

11:07.960 --> 11:12.880
I'm Weech Beacon, and this is
my producer, Ben Egyptian.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.040
Hi, Steven.

11:15.040 --> 11:19.240
I got to go.
See you later, Ben.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.400
Hey, sit.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.200
All right.
Yeah, Ben couldn't stay.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.080
He's gotta go square things
with his daughter.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.720
It's the 16th time
he's missed her birthday.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.920
Yeah.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.320
Jesus.

11:35.840 --> 11:39.680
You know what?
You look exactly like a waiter,

11:39.680 --> 11:43.720
but also exactly like a butler.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.160
Yeah, you'll be perfect.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.320
I'm just going to tell Brad.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.080
That's all very good.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.240
Sorry,
I've drunk rather a lot of water,

11:52.240 --> 11:55.320
so I'll need to use the men's room.
Do you know where it's located?

11:59.840 --> 12:02.920
What, that?
Yeah.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.200
Really? What?

12:42.720 --> 12:45.960
Must have drunk a gallon of water.
Is it always this hot?

12:45.960 --> 12:47.440
Actually...

12:47.440 --> 12:49.000
Oh, damn.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.400
That chilli went
straight through me.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.720
Whoa!

12:56.720 --> 12:58.720
Goddamn chilli.
Good God.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.160
Jesus Christ!

13:00.160 --> 13:01.400
Oh!

13:05.240 --> 13:09.640
You say the line, <i>"May I offer you
some wine, Herr Shimmerman?"</i>

13:09.640 --> 13:14.080
<i>"Shimmerman." And then hand
the glass to him from the tray.</i>

13:14.080 --> 13:15.760
OK, doesn't sound too difficult.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.760
Hey, this is a crucial scene,

13:17.760 --> 13:20.640
and I'm planning to do it all
in one ten-minute take.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.760
There'll be a long tracking shot.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.680
I'm using 2,000 extras, dancing girls,
and well over 1,000 horses,

13:26.680 --> 13:31.480
and then everything will focus
on you,

13:31.480 --> 13:34.800
and the shot will probably cost
about $3 million,

13:34.800 --> 13:38.560
so, yeah,
you better not screw it up.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.600
Well, no pressure, then.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.480
Shit.
Oh, dear.

13:44.480 --> 13:48.040
No. <i>LOTS </i>of pressure.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.880
I know, I was just being sarcastic.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.120
You were being what? Sarcastic.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.440
Well, that's a British thing,
sarcasm.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.000
We don't do that here in LA, OK?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.760
Say the goddamn line!

14:00.200 --> 14:02.080
May I offer you some wine,

14:02.080 --> 14:03.480
Mr Shimmershine?

14:03.480 --> 14:05.480
Shimmerman! Shimmerman.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.880
Jesus.
Sorry, I just got the name wrong.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.760
Would you mind if I took that again?

14:11.600 --> 14:14.880
I could have offered this role
to any slack Jack Harris in town.

14:14.880 --> 14:18.040
Harris? But you got the part
because you look like a butler.

14:18.040 --> 14:23.720
And remember, this set-up
is going to cost $3 million.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.200
Right.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.720
Don't fuck it up, buddy.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.000
Understood.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.080
Yeah, it better be.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.280
Jesus Christ.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.920
Look at you, you dirty dog.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.000
Have you been a naughty mongrel?

14:48.800 --> 14:50.880
What's that?

14:50.880 --> 14:52.040
Good grief.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.320
I wondered where that went.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.640
You nasty, thieving mutt.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.720
Someone's getting punished now.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.440
Severely punished.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.840
Has anyone ever told you that
you actually do look like a dog?

15:05.840 --> 15:09.040
Yes. Some people have
remarked on it before.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.160
Shut up, Dogface!

15:11.160 --> 15:15.920
Shepherd, I'm not sure
this S&M stuff is for me.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.720
Are you serious?

15:17.720 --> 15:20.680
We haven't even introduced
the man in the mask yet.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.840
Who?

15:21.840 --> 15:25.320
I auditioned a lot of people
to help me out with our little game.

15:25.320 --> 15:29.440
You want to see this guy.
He has no inhibitions whatsoever.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.920
Jesus.
Man in the mask, enter.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.200
I'm ready to be your slave,
O Mistress.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.040
Hang about.
Huh?

15:40.240 --> 15:41.760
Ed?!

15:41.760 --> 15:44.040
Toast!

15:44.040 --> 15:45.520
How are you finding LA?

15:45.520 --> 15:48.040
What the hell are you doing here,
Ed?

15:48.040 --> 15:50.560
I was visiting friends and happened
to see an advertisement

15:50.560 --> 15:52.240
in a local cafe.
What the hell is going on?

15:52.240 --> 15:53.560
Do you two know each other?

15:53.560 --> 15:56.520
Yes, we used to be housemates
in London.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.200
I was going to look you up, Toast,

15:58.200 --> 16:00.240
but I wasn't expecting to meet you
like this.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.560
Can't say I'm surprised.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.240
Could never resist a kinky knees-up,
could you, Ed?

16:04.240 --> 16:06.760
A kinky knees-up?

16:06.760 --> 16:09.280
Oh, I like the sound of that.

16:09.280 --> 16:12.040
So, since we're all here,
let's get down to business.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.240
Starting on Toast,
is that right, mistress?

16:14.240 --> 16:16.240
Are you ready, man in the mask?

16:16.240 --> 16:17.560
Oh, yes.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.960
Then, if it's OK, me next.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.800
Shit.

16:28.680 --> 16:29.840
How was your day?

16:29.840 --> 16:32.560
Well, apart from my
sexually-liberated girlfriend

16:32.560 --> 16:34.920
who insisted on stringing me up
and whipping me

16:34.920 --> 16:39.040
in front of my old roommate from
London who was dressed in rubber,

16:39.040 --> 16:40.680
I'd say pretty ordinary.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.920
It is hard in LA
to find your footing,

16:42.920 --> 16:44.840
but at least you have
this other acting job.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.200
What's your line again?

16:46.200 --> 16:47.760
Oh.

16:47.760 --> 16:51.800
<i>"May I offer you some wine,
Herr Shimmer...ton?"</i>

16:53.880 --> 16:56.560
Herr Shimmerson.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.360
Shimmergroove.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.920
Herr... Shimmerguff.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.160
Herr Shimmertree.

17:06.160 --> 17:09.160
Herr Shimmerblue.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.440
Herr Shimmerfoot.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.680
Herr Shimmersquare.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.320
Herr Shimmerhair.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.920
Hello, my name is Liberty.
Are you Sandwich?

17:28.920 --> 17:30.520
What?

17:30.520 --> 17:32.360
No, not Sandwich, Toast.

17:32.360 --> 17:36.320
Toast! I'm so sorry.
Mr Toast, not Mr Sandwich.

17:36.320 --> 17:40.120
Mr Toast, I'm afraid I'm going
to need to take that chair, sir.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.480
What, this chair?

17:41.480 --> 17:42.880
That chair, yes.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.880
The director has asked me to get him
a chair,

17:44.880 --> 17:47.000
but as soon as I find another one,
Mr Toast,

17:47.000 --> 17:48.800
I'll bring it straight over here.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.480
Oh, he's also asked
you don't move from this spot,

17:54.480 --> 17:56.120
otherwise you could be in shot.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.000
Jesus Christ, if...

18:09.880 --> 18:12.840
Bloody hell, you could have
killed me, you dozy bastard.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.440
What?

18:14.440 --> 18:17.120
What the hell did he call us?
Fucking loser.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.720
So, there you go. One trumpet.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.600
I didn't ask for a trumpet.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.200
Oh, wait. You wanted a chair.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.800
A chair? Yes.
Unless you want me to sit on that.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.760
I'm so sorry, Mr Toast.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.000
This is my first day.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.920
Who ordered the trumpet?

18:32.920 --> 18:34.560
This is ridiculous.

18:34.560 --> 18:38.120
You might want to get rid of this
before someone falls arse over tit.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.440
Absolutely.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.080
Toast! Get your ass over here!

18:47.520 --> 18:52.080
I can't tell you how important it is
that you don't mess up this shot.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.600
It's going to be a ten-minute
one-shot take.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.240
At the end of it, you walk in,
say your line.

19:01.560 --> 19:02.920
You know your line, right?

19:02.920 --> 19:07.160
Yeah. <i>"May I offer you some wine,
Herr Shimmershoo?"</i>

19:07.160 --> 19:08.720
Shimmerman! Jesus Christ!

19:08.720 --> 19:11.240
Sorry. Do I look like
the cream cheese fairy, huh?

19:11.240 --> 19:12.920
I don't know.
I don't know who that is.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.960
Am I a chicken in a basket?

19:14.960 --> 19:16.480
Again, I'm not sure.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.600
This set-up costs $3 million.

19:19.600 --> 19:20.800
How much did it cost?

19:20.800 --> 19:22.200
Three million.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.600
Yeah, that's right.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.160
So you'd better get it right, baby.
One chance.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.320
How many chances?

19:27.320 --> 19:28.960
One.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.440
OK, everybody ready.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.160
Positions, please.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.480
Hey!

19:41.040 --> 19:43.120
Fucking...

19:57.880 --> 20:01.520
May I offer you some wine,
Herr Shimmelshine?

20:01.520 --> 20:03.280
Whoa!

20:03.280 --> 20:04.760
Damn it!

20:06.600 --> 20:07.920
What?!

20:14.920 --> 20:18.080
How do you think that scene went
just now?

20:18.080 --> 20:19.760
Not great, to be honest.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.240
I tripped on a skateboard
and buggered up my line.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.040
Yeah, yeah.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.720
Forgive me,
my memory's a little hazy,

20:26.720 --> 20:31.200
but at any point did I tell you
it was absolutely crucial

20:31.200 --> 20:34.480
that you got your shit together,
because if you didn't,

20:34.480 --> 20:38.000
you could totally fuck up a shot
that cost $3 million?!

20:39.600 --> 20:42.640
You... You remember that?

20:42.640 --> 20:44.040
Yeah, I remember.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.000
OK, Steven Toast...

20:49.160 --> 20:51.600
...what do you think we should do now?

20:51.600 --> 20:53.600
I don't know, er,

20:53.600 --> 20:56.480
reset and shoot the scene again?

21:00.560 --> 21:04.000
OK, I see what we got here.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.440
Take off your pants.
I beg your pardon?

21:06.440 --> 21:08.520
Take them down
and bend over the table.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.040
What the...?
Now!

21:11.280 --> 21:14.040
Hey, Ben. Hey, Weech. Just in time.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.720
You want a piece of the action?

21:18.640 --> 21:20.640
Is this absolutely necessary?

21:20.640 --> 21:24.120
Well, it won't bring me
my money back,

21:24.120 --> 21:27.000
but I'll feel
a whole shitload better about it.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.640
Grip the desk.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.680
Hey, Mr Toast, I found you a chair,

21:31.680 --> 21:33.400
but I'm guessing you're good.

21:38.360 --> 21:42.080
Moving my right hand
across the lower back

21:42.080 --> 21:45.240
and down to the buttock area.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.760
What the hell is going on, Toast?

21:50.760 --> 21:54.560
Your goddamn ass
feels like a giant cookie.

21:54.560 --> 21:59.080
Yeah, it's a bit sore down there,
Shepherd. It's starting to burn.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.040
Maybe I'll have a cold shower.

22:03.640 --> 22:07.000
That ass has taken
one hell of a beating.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.840
I thought you said
you weren't into S&M.

22:10.840 --> 22:14.200
I'm not. The director
I'm working with did it.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.880
I ruined his shot,
so he thrashed me with his belt.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.560
Did it in front of his producer
and a young runner.

22:19.560 --> 22:22.840
Very humiliating, not to mention
highly unprofessional.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.440
Mm. Urgh.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.400
You're top class, Shepherd.

22:31.400 --> 22:35.280
This is the best relationship
I've ever been in.

22:35.280 --> 22:38.240
I'm so incredibly happy,
I believe I could fly.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.880
What are you doing, darling?

22:40.880 --> 22:46.800
Oh, I'm just making
a few final notes on my scorecards.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.960
Scorecard, you say?

22:49.960 --> 22:52.720
I'm guessing I'll get a 10,
or maybe a 9.5.

22:54.120 --> 22:57.480
I have to go. More research.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.640
All right.

22:59.640 --> 23:03.240
<i>â™ª My grandfather's hands
went wandering â™ª</i>

23:03.240 --> 23:06.600
<i>â™ª Wandering from north
down to south... â™ª</i>

23:14.600 --> 23:16.640
What's this?

23:16.640 --> 23:19.040
Weech Beacon?

23:19.040 --> 23:25.040
What's it say? <i>"Poor performance,
predictable, dull, unexciting.</i>

23:25.040 --> 23:28.680
<i>Total, zero out of ten."
</i>Brilliant.

23:38.160 --> 23:41.600
I say, Billy,
how do I post something online?

23:41.600 --> 23:44.560
You know that bloody director
who shredded my arse?

23:44.560 --> 23:47.240
Well, I found out something
pretty embarrassing about him

23:47.240 --> 23:50.400
and I want to put it online
as an act of revenge.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.920
I can do that for you.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.320
You can? Mm.

23:53.320 --> 23:57.640
I must warn you, I'm pretty useless
when it comes to the social mediums.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.840
Nonos problemos. Let's do it.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.800
Really? Yeah. Fantastic.

24:01.800 --> 24:05.240
I'll leave you to it and I'll enjoy
the rest of my pina colada

24:05.240 --> 24:08.280
on the terrace.
Okey dokey, Smokey.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.640
Very much appreciate you helping me,
Billy.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.960
Happy to do this for you, Toast.
Yes.

24:16.920 --> 24:20.880
Oh, before I forget, do make sure
my account is anonymous.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.200
This is the life.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.360
What's the internet saying about me?

24:34.360 --> 24:35.960
How cool I am? Yeah.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.840
Loved my last movie.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.200
What the...?

24:42.200 --> 24:44.280
Shit. Shit!

24:47.080 --> 24:49.840
Jesus Christ, how the hell
did that get there?

24:49.840 --> 24:51.520
Is that my scorecard, huh?

24:51.520 --> 24:55.480
<i>"Poor performance, predictable,
dull, unexciting"?!</i>

24:55.480 --> 25:00.200
I mean, whoa, zero out of ten?
Zero out of goddamn ten?!

25:00.200 --> 25:03.480
No, that is not right.
That is not your scorecard.

25:03.480 --> 25:06.720
What? Well, that is the score card
of a hopeless loser

25:06.720 --> 25:09.120
I was sleeping with
as research for my book.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.040
His name is Steven Toast.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.960
That's the dumb-ass jerk
who just ruined my movie.

25:13.960 --> 25:17.520
What? I asked Liberty to type up
my scorecards from the notes

25:17.520 --> 25:20.320
I'd put together. She's obviously
got the names mixed up.

25:20.320 --> 25:25.080
What a loser.
Yes, he is a zero out of ten loser.

25:25.080 --> 25:30.840
But you, you, baby,
you are a ten out of ten winner.

25:30.840 --> 25:34.680
I'm going to find your real
scorecard and post it there.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.840
Whoa, I'm a ten out of ten?

25:36.840 --> 25:38.840
You betcha.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.360
Are you ready to play,
little doggie?

25:41.360 --> 25:42.680
Oh, yeah.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.800
Woof!

25:44.800 --> 25:49.840
And after we have some fun,
I'm going to go get my scorecards.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.040
Oh, yeah, baby.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.960
Woof!

26:00.400 --> 26:03.160
Ah, Shepherd, what a lovely surprise.
Come in.

26:03.160 --> 26:06.360
I know you posted that stuff
about Weech, Toast.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.680
No, I didn't.
It was an anonymous account.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.080
Then, maybe you shouldn't have
posted it

26:11.080 --> 26:15.920
under the name of <i>"Steven Toast,
specialises in playing butlers".</i>

26:15.920 --> 26:17.840
Right, OK.

26:17.840 --> 26:22.160
But we are still in a relationship,
aren't we, you and I?

26:22.160 --> 26:23.840
Scorecards.

26:31.400 --> 26:36.760
He's not a happy bunny, Toast.
You screwed up his whole movie,

26:36.760 --> 26:38.800
and then you went on
the social media

26:38.800 --> 26:41.400
saying he couldn't cut it
in the sack.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.240
Yeah, and also he gave my arse
a severe thrashing

26:44.240 --> 26:46.280
and stole my ladyfriend.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.160
Hopefully that'll be the end of it.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.240
Oh, God.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.480
No!

26:58.320 --> 27:00.160
This Hollywood Reporter magazine,

27:00.160 --> 27:03.360
now, I'm guessing it's a niche
publication that nobody reads.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.640
Would I be right?

27:04.640 --> 27:06.880
Wrong? It's read by everyone
in Hollywood.

27:06.880 --> 27:08.480
Absolutely everyone.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.240
Even people who never read anything
read it.

27:11.240 --> 27:12.320
God!

27:13.880 --> 27:17.160
Hey, you want to try to fit
a piece into my Tricky Dick

27:17.160 --> 27:20.200
jigsaw puzzle?
Jigsaw?

27:20.200 --> 27:22.480
Yeah, might take your mind
off of things.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.120
Doesn't fit.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.000
Aw, doesn't fit?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.600
Bad luck, loser.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.440
I'm so sorry I used your name
on the account.

27:40.440 --> 27:43.320
I didn't know
you wanted to be anonymous.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.920
It's not your fault.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.440
I should have supervised
my own caper.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.920
Poor you. Are you OK?

27:52.080 --> 27:53.720
You might have to remove that hand.

27:53.720 --> 27:56.200
I'm not used to people
being nice to me.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.800

28:06.800 --> 28:09.440
<i>â™ª You wanted everything now
not later â™ª</i>

28:09.440 --> 28:11.680
