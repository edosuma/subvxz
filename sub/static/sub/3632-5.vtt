00:03.390 --> 00:04.556
We have to leave now.

00:05.008 --> 00:07.241
This thing on my neck.
It's burning, Logan.

00:07.243 --> 00:08.709
We need to find Savannah

00:08.711 --> 00:10.377
before he ruins the rest of her life.

00:10.379 --> 00:13.681
I promise. I won't let
anything happen to you.

00:13.683 --> 00:14.881
Paige: If he's a witch...

00:14.883 --> 00:16.716
Ruth: Not if, you know he's a witch.

00:16.718 --> 00:18.352
Well, that means somebody
broke the Commandment.

00:18.354 --> 00:20.621
Jeremy: Her name is Melanie Lau.

00:20.623 --> 00:22.356
I just need to see Dr. Bauer.

00:22.358 --> 00:23.590
Who's Dr. Bauer?

00:23.592 --> 00:24.924
Mom! It's killing her!

00:24.926 --> 00:26.527
Jeremy: We have some
information to go on.

00:26.529 --> 00:28.428
Starting with tracking
down this Dr. Bauer.

00:28.430 --> 00:30.797
Everything I do is for you.

00:30.799 --> 00:32.031

00:32.034 --> 00:33.867
Aleister: What we need from
her is her wolf blood.

00:33.869 --> 00:36.970
The wolf's blood should be
attacking the witch's blood.

00:36.972 --> 00:38.638
How is that possible?

00:38.640 --> 00:40.807

Dr. Bauer, please respond.

05:14.046 --> 05:16.313
You'll know. I know you'll know.

05:16.315 --> 05:20.217
She injected herself. That is your
blood coursing through her body.

05:27.058 --> 05:29.193
We're so close, she
can't be sick for long.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.996

05:31.998 --> 05:34.765

she's going to die.

05:41.171 --> 05:42.372
She is.

05:42.374 --> 05:45.575

I still need her. So if you
want to survive the day,

06:49.673 --> 06:54.141
Um... I'm not sure I can
give you a recommendation.

06:54.143 --> 06:55.510
Why not?

06:55.512 --> 06:58.480
For a brief time, we were
more than colleagues.

06:58.482 --> 07:01.649
If I speak unfavorably, she
might think it's personal.

07:01.651 --> 07:03.750
I'm just asking your
professional opinion.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.688
I felt bad after I fired her...

07:07.690 --> 07:09.991
(Lighter clicks)

07:09.993 --> 07:11.459
When I checked in on her afterwards

07:11.461 --> 07:14.028
she was packing her apartment

07:14.030 --> 07:16.263
to move in with some other guy.

07:16.265 --> 07:17.531
Timothy Ashmont.

07:17.533 --> 07:20.601
I was pissed off. I might
have said some things.

07:20.603 --> 07:23.604
Can you tell me why you fired her?

07:23.606 --> 07:27.073
It was a university protocol matter.

07:27.075 --> 07:29.710
That's all I can say.

07:29.712 --> 07:34.481
Paige: Standard 411 search
gives us six T. Ashmonts.

07:34.483 --> 07:35.815
One deceased.

07:35.817 --> 07:37.617
We're going to have
to do better than 411

07:37.619 --> 07:39.219
if we want to find these guys.

07:39.221 --> 07:41.502
Why don't you let Nick here
have a crack at the hack, huh?

07:42.956 --> 07:46.759
Nick Sorrentino. 234 women have
matched with you on Tinder

07:46.761 --> 07:49.195
this month alone. You
present like a cool guy

07:49.197 --> 07:51.064
but your most played song on Spotify

07:51.066 --> 07:53.232
is Beyoncé's "Single Ladies".

07:53.234 --> 07:56.936
I am better at finding information than
you are at covering up your tracks.

07:56.938 --> 08:02.141
Look, while we're busy up
in each other's business here,

08:02.143 --> 08:04.076
I got you this.

08:04.078 --> 08:06.879
Consider it an olive branch.

08:06.881 --> 08:08.680
Looks like a ginger root.

08:08.682 --> 08:11.917
Well, I Wiki'd your herbs,

08:11.919 --> 08:16.522
and I found out that that one is
a powerful protection from evil.

08:16.524 --> 08:20.426
You've been through hell the past
few days with Savannah, Bridget.

08:20.428 --> 08:22.327
We almost lost your mother.

08:22.329 --> 08:25.263
So, I... I don't know, I thought...
I thought that could help.

08:27.334 --> 08:29.734
If you did the full research
on the powers of the ginger root

08:29.736 --> 08:33.136
you would also know that they're
used for heating up love affairs.

Southbury, Connecticut.

08:43.749 --> 08:45.716
Father, deceased.

08:45.718 --> 08:47.318
Mother's still there.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.619
Well, let's go get her.

08:51.590 --> 08:52.656
Is it done?

08:52.658 --> 08:54.825
Clay and Nick put Melanie's body to rest

08:54.827 --> 08:57.495
under a sumach tree in bloom.

08:57.497 --> 08:58.929
I'm sure no one has any idea

08:58.931 --> 09:03.533
that she lies cold in a
back corner of Stonehaven.

09:03.535 --> 09:06.870
Well, it's a secret we
shall carry together.

09:06.872 --> 09:10.040
It's one of the few we carry together.

09:10.042 --> 09:13.644
I'm curious, though, about
the ones we don't share.

09:13.646 --> 09:17.147
Those cards we keep
close to our chest. Oh?

09:17.149 --> 09:19.849
You never answered my question.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.585
Aleister knows your name.

09:21.587 --> 09:25.255
What business does he have
with you if he's not a witch?

09:25.257 --> 09:28.358
My encounter with him
at the barn was our first.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.227
I've never met this man.

09:30.229 --> 09:33.529
I have no idea why he's
targeting me or my Coven.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.765
In order to defeat an enemy,

09:35.767 --> 09:37.399
you have to know the enemy.

09:37.401 --> 09:41.070
Aleister took Savannah and
he was hunting Malcolm. Why?

09:41.072 --> 09:43.740
Is he collecting a menagerie?
I don't know.

09:43.742 --> 09:45.842
We've tracked a line
on Bauer's boyfriend.

09:45.844 --> 09:47.376
Well, Paige did.

09:48.945 --> 09:50.679
Are you going to be okay if we go out?

09:50.681 --> 09:53.315
I'll make sure your mother
gets the rest she needs.

09:57.654 --> 10:00.523
You said to defeat an enemy,
one must know their enemy.

10:02.559 --> 10:04.860
Aleister is not our only enemy.

10:06.595 --> 10:08.496
I'll need you to drive me.

10:15.404 --> 10:17.906
Why did you take Elena?

10:17.908 --> 10:21.042
Is that what you want
the lesson to be about?

10:21.044 --> 10:23.645
I'm allowed to care.

10:23.647 --> 10:25.780
She's my friend.

10:25.782 --> 10:28.316
You can do better than her.

10:28.318 --> 10:29.817
I like her.

10:29.819 --> 10:32.820
It's just that Elena...

10:32.822 --> 10:35.290
well, all werewolves, really,

10:35.292 --> 10:37.491
they are animals.

10:37.493 --> 10:39.293
So, what...

10:39.295 --> 10:43.030
it's just okay for you hurt them?

10:43.032 --> 10:44.198
Aleister, it's not.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.434
Let's take your mind off of Elena. Hm?

10:47.436 --> 10:49.970
Let's try a new spell.

10:49.972 --> 10:51.939
First, I need you to focus on something.

10:54.275 --> 10:55.642
How about your attendant?

10:59.814 --> 11:02.449
Let's try to put her to sleep.

11:02.451 --> 11:05.118
Focus on her, and say:

11:05.120 --> 11:07.621
<i>Dies coartati.</i>

11:19.967 --> 11:22.969
<i>Dies coartati.</i>

11:27.807 --> 11:29.842
I can't do this without a talisman.

11:29.844 --> 11:32.311
I think you can. Try again.

11:32.313 --> 11:34.513
(Clears throat)

11:34.515 --> 11:37.283
<i>Dies coartati.</i>

11:38.885 --> 11:40.119

11:41.921 --> 11:44.156

11:50.496 --> 11:53.098
I can hear the electricity
behind the walls.

11:54.901 --> 11:58.937
The photoreceptors in
my eyes are sh... shifting.

11:58.939 --> 12:00.938
I can't see red.

12:00.940 --> 12:03.475
Just blue and yellow.

12:03.477 --> 12:06.678
(Moaning, ragged breathing)

12:06.680 --> 12:08.713
Tell me how it's going to feel.

12:13.018 --> 12:14.552
(Sighing)

12:17.355 --> 12:20.291
The Change begins at the extremities.

12:23.595 --> 12:26.630
Hands, feet.

12:26.632 --> 12:30.168
On the physical level,
but it begins before that.

12:32.970 --> 12:35.572
You've noticed.

12:35.574 --> 12:38.141
The hunger.

12:38.143 --> 12:41.612
The insatiable need to hunt.

12:41.614 --> 12:44.214
The pain.

12:44.216 --> 12:46.216
It's beautiful.

12:46.218 --> 12:47.484

13:16.196 --> 13:19.131

- Please.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.402
<i>And the one chosen.</i>

13:53.265 --> 13:55.566

13:55.568 --> 13:57.601
(Recording) <i>Only two shall remain:</i>

13:57.603 --> 14:01.271
<i>the horned witch and the one chosen.</i>

14:01.273 --> 14:03.240
<i>There is only one...</i>

14:03.242 --> 14:05.742
Sondra: (Wailing, moaning)

14:07.111 --> 14:10.247
You're going to want to kill me
on the other side of the Change.

14:10.249 --> 14:11.781
I've got to get out of here.

14:15.686 --> 14:17.653
Why did it stop?

14:17.655 --> 14:20.423
Why does it still hurt?

14:20.425 --> 14:22.692
Why is it like this? Why
isn't it any easy for me,

14:22.694 --> 14:23.860
like it is for you?

14:23.862 --> 14:25.995
The pain is the same for everyone.

14:28.532 --> 14:31.567
(Gasping, moaning)

14:34.338 --> 14:35.705
Morphine.

14:35.707 --> 14:37.340
I don't want it.

14:39.710 --> 14:41.744
The pain is mine.

14:41.746 --> 14:45.348
It's for Aleister. I won't
let you take it away.

14:47.516 --> 14:49.684
Then tell me what his plan is,

14:49.686 --> 14:53.655
or I force this down your throat.

14:53.657 --> 14:55.490
Why does he want my blood?

14:55.492 --> 14:57.793
Does he want to turn more women?

14:57.795 --> 14:59.594
No.

14:59.596 --> 15:01.830
To kill the witches.

15:01.832 --> 15:03.898
He needs to inject the
blood of the cursed

15:03.900 --> 15:05.567
into the one that curses.

15:05.569 --> 15:09.371
Who's the cursed, who's
the one that curses?

15:09.373 --> 15:11.573
The werewolf.

15:11.575 --> 15:13.040
And the witch.

15:15.077 --> 15:17.178
This is the way the world ends.

15:17.180 --> 15:19.213
(Wailing)

15:19.215 --> 15:20.648
(Thud)

15:20.650 --> 15:23.651
Aleister: So tell me,
what did Dr. Bauer say?

15:23.653 --> 15:24.852
She's dying.

15:27.089 --> 15:29.056
You know that's not what I mean.

15:33.996 --> 15:36.430
(Gasping)

15:43.505 --> 15:45.606
Aleister: An assassination attempt.

15:49.344 --> 15:51.845
Of course you'd have to try.

15:51.847 --> 15:54.647
What good are you as a
werewolf if you don't?

15:54.649 --> 15:57.184
I should not have survived
in the first place.

15:57.186 --> 15:58.318
But I did.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.354
She's a little... It's dementia.

16:01.356 --> 16:02.689
She might not remember you.

16:02.691 --> 16:05.225
(Applause, chuckles on TV)

16:06.994 --> 16:09.196
(Door opening)

16:09.198 --> 16:10.363
Paige: Hello.

16:10.365 --> 16:13.366
Nick: Mrs. Ashmont? Oh hi, there.

16:13.368 --> 16:15.601
We remember you from church.

16:15.603 --> 16:17.937
And your son, Timothy.

16:17.939 --> 16:21.907
We went to school with him. We were a
little bit younger than him, but...

16:21.909 --> 16:24.410
Do you know where he
is? Timothy Ashmont?

16:24.412 --> 16:26.912
That boy was not my son.

16:26.914 --> 16:28.981
I don't want anything
to do with that boy.

16:30.783 --> 16:34.053
And I will show them.

16:34.055 --> 16:35.654
The witches?

16:35.656 --> 16:38.057
Maybe you need a counselor
instead of a compound.

16:38.059 --> 16:40.059
<i>What</i> I need...

16:45.231 --> 16:47.499
What I need is amends.

16:50.202 --> 16:52.003
This is not a sad story.

16:52.005 --> 16:54.038
This is a tale of victory.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.208
How I was cast out, and the church
who found me on their doorstep,

16:57.210 --> 16:59.978
found me a family,
a family that raised me

16:59.980 --> 17:03.948
in the fire and brimstone
of the holy book.

17:03.950 --> 17:05.683
Hands held around the dinner table,

17:05.685 --> 17:11.021
saying grace as though that
brought grace into our lives.

17:11.023 --> 17:13.723
Then something changed.

17:13.726 --> 17:15.526
I changed.

17:15.528 --> 17:18.028
Suddenly, around the age
of 12, I could do things.

17:18.030 --> 17:20.263
Move a cup across the table.

17:21.532 --> 17:25.234
Made my cat bleed to death
just by thinking about it.

17:25.237 --> 17:27.237
They didn't understand.

17:27.239 --> 17:30.441
They thought I was possessed.

17:30.443 --> 17:35.045
He did things. Evil things.

17:35.047 --> 17:37.447
We tried to help him.

17:37.449 --> 17:39.516
But he was full of the devil.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.289
(Sighing)
That boy was full of the devil.

17:46.991 --> 17:51.294
How do you get the devil out of a boy?

17:51.296 --> 17:53.797
You can try to beat it out.

17:53.799 --> 17:57.467
My father had a particular technique.

17:57.469 --> 17:59.769
A belt buckle that said...

17:59.771 --> 18:01.237
"Faith".

18:01.239 --> 18:03.740
And he used to beat his faith into me

18:03.742 --> 18:05.574
every single day.

18:14.451 --> 18:17.886
Woman: What he did to my husband,

18:17.888 --> 18:20.823
that was the devil in him.

18:20.825 --> 18:24.927
The boy was clear across the field...

18:24.929 --> 18:26.728
when my husband bled

18:26.730 --> 18:30.165
from his nose, his eyes,

18:30.167 --> 18:31.600
everywhere.

18:31.602 --> 18:33.401
He died?

18:33.403 --> 18:37.238
I told the doctor that
it was a farming accident.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.708
That he got caught up in the harvester.

18:41.810 --> 18:43.345
I know...

18:43.347 --> 18:45.746
Timothy did that.

18:45.748 --> 18:48.416
When I'd had enough,

18:48.418 --> 18:51.886
I did to my father
what I had done to that cat.

18:51.888 --> 18:54.289
Paige: Where is Timothy?

18:54.291 --> 18:57.324
You don't go looking for him.

18:57.326 --> 18:59.193
Nothing good can come of that.

18:59.195 --> 19:00.461
Nothing.

19:02.397 --> 19:04.732
(Gasping)

19:04.734 --> 19:06.968
You have the same eyes as him.

19:06.970 --> 19:09.570
You're like him.

19:09.572 --> 19:11.738
You're like him!

19:11.740 --> 19:13.140
You're like him.
(Dialling beeps)

19:13.142 --> 19:14.441
You're just like him!

19:14.443 --> 19:15.876
Where is he?

19:15.878 --> 19:17.378
You're like him. You're like him!

19:17.380 --> 19:18.578
You're just like him!

19:18.580 --> 19:20.314
She doesn't know anything.

19:20.316 --> 19:23.017
Get away from me! Get away from me!

19:23.019 --> 19:25.752
- Get away from me! Get away from me!
- Mrs. Ashmont?

19:28.956 --> 19:30.356
I'd hate to have to do that to you.

19:30.358 --> 19:31.758
I'd hate to have to do that to you.

19:33.528 --> 19:36.596
So tell me, what did Dr. Bauer say?

19:38.833 --> 19:41.968
That you're going to inject
my blood into Savannah.

19:45.139 --> 19:46.772
If you do, you'll kill her.

19:46.774 --> 19:49.608
No, Savannah is the chosen one.

19:50.710 --> 19:53.913
It won't kill her but
it will all the others.

19:53.915 --> 19:55.581
They're connected on a spiritual nexus.

19:55.583 --> 19:57.517
I just need to infect one.

19:58.852 --> 20:01.954
Do you know how you wipe
out an invasive species?

20:03.990 --> 20:05.991
You introduce a predator.

20:08.461 --> 20:10.429
(Door opening)

20:10.431 --> 20:11.964
Dr. Bauer's escaped.

20:11.966 --> 20:14.266
(Shaky breaths)
(Alarm beeping)

20:19.672 --> 20:21.005
Dr. Penner.

20:21.007 --> 20:22.674
Just one more thing.

20:22.676 --> 20:24.109
I'll come clean.

20:24.111 --> 20:25.910
I've got a bad feeling
about Sondra Bauer.

20:25.912 --> 20:28.813
I'm looking for a
reason not to hire her.

20:28.815 --> 20:32.050
But I can't go back to the
selection committee with nothing.

20:32.052 --> 20:33.585
Why was she fired?

20:33.587 --> 20:37.455
She was fired for ethical reasons.

20:37.457 --> 20:40.024
What was she doing?

20:40.026 --> 20:43.227
What she was doing...

20:43.229 --> 20:45.496
frankly, was horrifying.

20:45.498 --> 20:49.266
She was creating aberrations
under the guise of science.

20:49.268 --> 20:52.169
I never filed a complaint because
I didn't want to run the risk

20:52.171 --> 20:54.505
of our university losing its funding.

20:54.507 --> 20:55.706
I had no idea.

20:55.708 --> 20:58.008
What sort of aberrations?

20:58.010 --> 21:02.546
Gene-splicing. Animal mutations.

21:02.548 --> 21:03.880
Stay clear of her.

21:03.882 --> 21:07.017
I don't want to see her taking
advantage of another facility.

21:09.553 --> 21:12.522
(Alarm beeping)

21:16.060 --> 21:17.360
Dr. Bauer survived.

21:17.362 --> 21:20.864
Yeah, she did. But she's
out there and hungry.

21:20.866 --> 21:22.799
So let her eat.

21:22.801 --> 21:24.100

21:24.102 --> 21:25.335

Right now, I'm your
best bet at saving her.

21:55.535 --> 21:58.270
Dr. Bauer knows how important
the girl is to me.

21:58.272 --> 22:00.538
A predator just sees prey,

22:00.540 --> 22:03.708

Savannah will look like to her.

22:03.710 --> 22:06.345
Go. Stop her.

22:10.983 --> 22:13.852

under any circumstances.

I know that you're scared.

27:09.106 --> 27:11.106
You don't have to be scared anymore.

27:12.842 --> 27:15.577
I'll take you back to your
room now, safe and sound.

27:27.423 --> 27:29.991
- Dr. Bauer.
- 24 crows.

27:29.993 --> 27:31.226
Sondra.

27:31.228 --> 27:32.427
Four six.

27:33.596 --> 27:36.331
This is the way the world ends.

27:36.333 --> 27:39.434
This is the way... the world... ends.

27:39.436 --> 27:40.634
(Laughing)

27:40.636 --> 27:44.072
This is the way the world ends.

27:44.074 --> 27:45.272
Sondra.

27:51.146 --> 27:54.048
Timothy.

27:54.050 --> 27:56.217
You saved me.

27:56.219 --> 27:58.652
I can take it all away.

27:58.654 --> 28:00.654
All pain. All concern.

28:02.290 --> 28:05.092
(Teeth snap)
24 crows.

28:05.094 --> 28:07.294
Four six.

28:07.296 --> 28:09.162
Four six.

28:09.164 --> 28:11.232
This is the way the world ends. Ah...

28:13.000 --> 28:14.300
Shh.

28:19.273 --> 28:20.874
For you, my first.

28:22.910 --> 28:26.046
I will give you the most
beautiful pain in the world.

28:27.548 --> 28:28.849
What?

28:28.851 --> 28:31.183
(Inaudible)

28:35.723 --> 28:37.823

29:17.214 --> 29:19.381
Ruth: What you have with your Mutts,

29:19.383 --> 29:21.316
we have with witches as well.

29:21.318 --> 29:25.253
Clara Sullivan was one of
our brightest witches,

29:25.255 --> 29:27.289
but she always had a dark side.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.526
Eventually,

29:30.528 --> 29:32.327
perhaps inevitably,

29:32.329 --> 29:34.096
she turned wicked.

29:34.098 --> 29:36.831
We had no choice but to shun her.

29:36.833 --> 29:40.202
You think she's involved with this?

29:40.204 --> 29:43.705
We shattered her talisman.
She has no powers.

29:43.707 --> 29:45.307
But she might have answers.

29:48.277 --> 29:51.445
No one hates me more than Clara.

29:51.447 --> 29:54.181
I'm the one who destroyed her powers.

29:54.183 --> 29:55.950
(Doorbell chiming)

30:03.993 --> 30:05.827
Well, Ruth.

30:05.829 --> 30:08.795
It's been years and you
haven't aged a day.

30:08.797 --> 30:10.531
Come to gloat?

30:10.533 --> 30:12.566
I've come to check in.

30:12.568 --> 30:14.001
Check in on what?

30:14.003 --> 30:15.569
(Wheezing laugh)

30:15.571 --> 30:17.671
Whether I've moved?

30:17.673 --> 30:19.173
How would I do that?

30:26.848 --> 30:29.683
The world is a difficult
place without powers.

30:32.020 --> 30:34.688
And you are?

30:34.690 --> 30:37.024
Clara Sullivan,

30:37.026 --> 30:38.959
Jeremy Danvers.

30:38.961 --> 30:42.462
Alpha of the North American Pack.

30:42.464 --> 30:45.565
Witches and werewolves,
working together?

30:47.768 --> 30:50.937
Well, this can't be good.

30:50.939 --> 30:53.373
Have you brought him here to kill me?

30:53.375 --> 30:55.241
Keep your hands clean?

30:55.243 --> 30:57.810
What do you know about what's happening?
(Scoffing)

30:57.812 --> 31:00.846
You're going to have to give me a
little bit more context, Ruth.

31:02.783 --> 31:04.416
Hold her, I'm going to scan her memory.

31:04.418 --> 31:05.651
No need, wolf.

31:10.891 --> 31:13.658

31:25.138 --> 31:27.005
You never followed through
with it, did you?

31:29.008 --> 31:30.408
What have you gotten us into?

31:30.410 --> 31:32.777
You got us into it.

31:32.779 --> 31:35.614
He's out there, isn't he?

31:35.616 --> 31:37.448
He's about to kill you.

31:37.450 --> 31:38.650
The prophecy.

31:38.652 --> 31:40.184
Well, I would care, Ruth,

31:40.186 --> 31:42.020
but I'm not a witch any longer.

31:42.022 --> 31:43.354
You made sure of that.

31:43.356 --> 31:46.424
You ruined me. Now he'll ruin you.

31:48.994 --> 31:51.195
I've made a mistake. We have to go.

31:51.197 --> 31:53.331
You've made a mortal mistake, Ruth.

31:53.333 --> 31:54.698
You're about to be destroyed...

31:54.700 --> 31:55.899
<i>Dormi!</i>

31:57.869 --> 31:59.270
We have to go.

32:03.274 --> 32:06.176
Clay: Dr. Bauer wasn't just
let go from the university,

32:06.178 --> 32:08.812
She was escorted off
the campus by security.

32:08.814 --> 32:11.015
Some sort of twisted experiments.

32:11.017 --> 32:12.415
I need to know that Elena is okay.

32:12.417 --> 32:13.917
You have to contact Savannah.

32:13.919 --> 32:16.086
I've tried. I can't do it without Ruth.

32:16.088 --> 32:17.287
And Ruth is with Jeremy.

32:17.289 --> 32:18.656
They're going to be at least an hour.

32:18.658 --> 32:19.889
What about the Ashmont lead?

32:19.891 --> 32:21.525
Ashmont is Aleister.

32:21.527 --> 32:24.093
This whole day has confirmed
nothing but the worst.

32:24.095 --> 32:27.497
Someone has broken the Commandment
and now there is a male witch.

32:27.499 --> 32:29.466
What... Commandment?

32:29.468 --> 32:31.768
We don't have boys.

32:31.770 --> 32:34.904
It's not biological, it's just the rule.

32:36.907 --> 32:38.174
It's complicated.

32:38.176 --> 32:39.341
Well, try us.

32:39.343 --> 32:41.844
We're not allowed to have boys.

32:41.846 --> 32:43.680
What, you just... kill your sons?

32:43.682 --> 32:45.548
It never gets as far as birth.

32:45.550 --> 32:47.784
What does it mean if
there's a male witch out there?

32:47.786 --> 32:50.953
The way that Christians
believe in the Apocalypse,

32:50.955 --> 32:53.255
witches believe in the
prophecy of the Tribulation.

32:53.257 --> 32:57.726
A male child born to a witch is
destined to bring about our downfall.

32:57.728 --> 32:58.960
Downfall. Like...

32:58.962 --> 33:00.929
Downfall like we die.

33:04.267 --> 33:06.468
So glad you're all right, Savannah.

33:09.839 --> 33:13.508
You don't have to worry about Dr. Bauer.

33:13.510 --> 33:14.810
She didn't survive.

33:17.146 --> 33:19.314
I want to be with Elena.

33:19.316 --> 33:21.149
You have nothing to be afraid of.

33:21.151 --> 33:22.650
I'm not afraid.

33:22.652 --> 33:25.553
And I won't be afraid ever again.

33:27.189 --> 33:28.789
<i>Obstructio.</i>

33:34.631 --> 33:38.533
We just have to get one
more blood sample from you.

33:38.535 --> 33:41.236
(Whispering) Can't we just go one
night without the test?

33:43.004 --> 33:44.438
I am the lock.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.406
Aleister's voice in echo:
<i>Key to the gate... Key to the gate...</i>

33:46.408 --> 33:47.674
And I am the key.

33:57.585 --> 33:59.986

34:06.361 --> 34:07.694
You know, for a bunch of brutes,

34:07.696 --> 34:09.596
you have everything a witch could want.

34:14.235 --> 34:16.770
Snakesroot.

34:16.772 --> 34:18.337
You know it as ginger.

34:19.505 --> 34:22.408
We've been over the uses for ginger.

34:25.612 --> 34:28.547
This is angelica.

34:28.549 --> 34:30.583
It can be worn for protection.

34:32.619 --> 34:35.788
There isn't enough angelica in
the world to protect us now.

34:38.056 --> 34:40.259
Hey, hey.

34:40.261 --> 34:42.027
Look at me.

34:42.029 --> 34:44.496

36:40.932 --> 36:42.232
Why have they brought you in here?

36:42.234 --> 36:43.599
I asked them to.

36:46.520 --> 36:47.987
Okay, um,

36:47.989 --> 36:50.422
would you like your choice
of a luxurious cot,

36:50.424 --> 36:53.159
or a super cold concrete floor?

36:53.161 --> 36:54.359
The cot.

36:57.164 --> 36:58.363
I can get him

36:58.365 --> 37:01.801
to make your room more
comfortable if you want.

37:01.803 --> 37:04.236
I don't want to get more comfortable.

37:04.238 --> 37:06.338
I want to get out of here.

37:06.340 --> 37:07.706
With you.

37:09.309 --> 37:12.411
He wants to do terrible
things to you, Savannah.

37:12.413 --> 37:15.847
He's teaching me how to protect myself.

37:15.849 --> 37:19.351
He wants to inject my blood into you.

37:19.353 --> 37:22.053
Whatever he's teaching you,
use that against him, okay?

37:22.055 --> 37:24.322
Don't let anyone near you. Not even me.

37:24.324 --> 37:26.191
Okay, one second.

37:26.193 --> 37:28.727
Why does he want to inject
your blood into me?

37:30.096 --> 37:33.431
To kill all of the witches.

37:33.433 --> 37:35.700
That sounds like the prophecy.

37:35.702 --> 37:38.703
You know, the son of a witch

37:38.705 --> 37:39.903
will kill all the witches.

37:39.905 --> 37:43.507
But that's just a fairy tale, right?

37:43.509 --> 37:45.509
Not to Aleister, it isn't.

37:46.778 --> 37:48.479
Savannah,

37:48.481 --> 37:50.948
can I talk to Ruth through you?

37:50.950 --> 37:52.216
I've never done...

37:52.218 --> 37:53.483
Please, Savannah.

37:53.485 --> 37:57.121
If you think you even
can, we have to try.

37:58.589 --> 38:00.290
(Sighing)

38:01.993 --> 38:04.594
Okay. On the bed.

38:08.733 --> 38:11.601
Paige has to contact me, but...

38:11.603 --> 38:12.802
let's try.

38:15.406 --> 38:16.606
Okay.

38:19.143 --> 38:22.145
(Mixed whispers)

38:22.147 --> 38:24.614

38:26.216 --> 38:29.051

38:31.721 --> 38:33.656
Sorry... sorry, that was an accident.

38:33.658 --> 38:35.124
You saw that?

38:35.126 --> 38:36.893
I did that to protect my family.

38:36.895 --> 38:39.896
And I would kill to protect you, okay?

38:39.898 --> 38:41.798
We're going to get
out of here, Savannah.

38:41.800 --> 38:45.668
I did what had to be done, okay?

38:45.670 --> 38:48.870
I'll keep an open channel for Paige.

38:48.872 --> 38:50.071
Okay, good.

38:51.408 --> 38:52.708
There's no time to waste.

38:52.710 --> 38:55.076
We need to reach Savannah.

38:55.078 --> 38:56.612
Clay: Where have you been?

38:56.614 --> 38:58.580
Ruth: Finding the truth.

38:58.582 --> 39:01.683
I haven't been fully transparent
with you, until now.

39:01.685 --> 39:04.519
And now the truth is
finally going to come out?

39:04.521 --> 39:07.823
Aleister is going to cast a
spell to kill all witches.

39:09.325 --> 39:12.027
That's why he has Elena and Savannah.

39:12.029 --> 39:13.295
The one cursed

39:13.297 --> 39:14.562
and the one who curses.

39:14.564 --> 39:16.464
Which one is Elena?

39:16.466 --> 39:17.898
She's the cursed.

39:17.900 --> 39:19.233
You all are.

39:19.235 --> 39:20.702
A piece of dark magic

39:20.704 --> 39:23.504
that turned a man
into the first werewolf.

39:23.506 --> 39:26.741
No, the first werewolf was the
seventh son of a seventh son.

39:26.743 --> 39:29.644
So your history tells you.

39:29.646 --> 39:32.446
Witchcraft is responsible
for our existence?

39:32.448 --> 39:35.649
That curse disrupted the
natural balance of our magic

39:35.651 --> 39:36.917
to such an extent

39:36.919 --> 39:40.087
that it created the doomsday prophecy...

39:40.089 --> 39:42.489
that a son born to a witch

39:42.491 --> 39:44.524
would survive to kill us all.

39:45.827 --> 39:47.194
Aleister.

39:47.196 --> 39:48.895
If we can catch Savannah

39:48.897 --> 39:50.263
before she comes into her powers,

39:50.265 --> 39:52.131
we have a fighting chance to stop this.

39:54.101 --> 39:55.369
Paige: Sorry, we were just...

39:55.371 --> 39:57.337
I need your full focus right now.

39:57.339 --> 39:59.373
We must reach Savannah.

39:59.375 --> 40:01.408
Yes, as fast as you can.

40:07.748 --> 40:09.815
(Slow exhalation)

40:09.817 --> 40:12.418
(Disembodied voices,
indistinct whispers)

40:18.692 --> 40:21.727
Ruth: Savannah, are you with us?

40:30.771 --> 40:32.337
This is Elena.

40:34.374 --> 40:35.941
How is that possible?

40:35.943 --> 40:37.242
I grabbed Savannah's hand

40:37.244 --> 40:39.111
and suddenly I can see you.

40:40.179 --> 40:42.680
(Echoing)
Are you okay?

40:42.682 --> 40:44.516
We're fine.

40:44.518 --> 40:46.051
I'm doing everything that I can

40:46.053 --> 40:47.752
to get us out of here,
but I need your help.

40:47.754 --> 40:49.254
Elena's voice: <i>Aleister is very close</i>

40:49.256 --> 40:50.956
<i>to pulling together some type of spell</i>

40:50.958 --> 40:52.190
<i>that will kill the witches.</i>

40:52.192 --> 40:54.926
Ruth: We know. We need to find you.

40:54.928 --> 40:57.028
Logan's here too.

40:57.030 --> 40:58.430
And Rachel.

40:58.432 --> 41:00.131
<i>We're somewhere in Quebec.</i>

41:00.133 --> 41:03.200
<i>I think it's some type</i>
<i>of former military base.</i>

41:03.202 --> 41:05.369
Look for a grouping of red roofs.

41:06.439 --> 41:07.939
I'll start looking.

41:07.941 --> 41:10.742
It's remote. We're surrounded by forest.

41:10.744 --> 41:12.609
I've heard a train
three miles to the east,

41:12.611 --> 41:14.678
and there's a field of lavender nearby.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.380
I wish that I had more.

41:16.382 --> 41:21.118
It is imperative that Savannah
not give in to Aleister's magic.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.786
Savannah...

41:22.788 --> 41:24.888
<i>Savannah, I know you can hear me.</i>

41:24.890 --> 41:28.291
I'm doing everything that I
can to protect Savannah.

41:34.432 --> 41:36.700
I miss you so much.

41:38.223 --> 41:39.703
I shouldn't have left your side to...

41:39.705 --> 41:40.971
go after Malcolm...

41:40.973 --> 41:42.706
Clay: (Echoing) <i>Hey, hey, listen to me.</i>

41:42.708 --> 41:46.676
<i>You have to be careful</i>
<i>of Dr. Bauer, okay?</i>

41:46.678 --> 41:47.910
She's dead.

41:50.247 --> 41:51.781
Jeremy: <i>Elena,</i>

41:51.783 --> 41:53.984
<i>I'm going to need you
to do whatever possible</i>

41:53.986 --> 41:56.386
to set up some sort of signal

41:56.388 --> 41:57.887
to help us identify that compound.

41:57.889 --> 41:59.456
<i>You hang tight.</i>

41:59.458 --> 42:01.190
<i>We will be there by morning.</i>

42:01.192 --> 42:03.158
(Echoing) <i>No matter what,</i>

42:03.160 --> 42:05.160
<i>I will find you.</i>

42:08.164 --> 42:09.765
I'll see you then.

42:20.843 --> 42:23.945
(Door opening) Woman:
The leader requests you.

42:25.281 --> 42:26.548
I don't want to go.

42:27.750 --> 42:29.284
Ah! I don't want...

42:29.286 --> 42:31.153
Elena: Remember what they
said about Aleister!

42:31.155 --> 42:32.488
You have to resist!
(Electric prod powering up)

42:32.490 --> 42:33.855
(Screaming)
(Electricity crackling)

42:33.857 --> 42:35.724
No! No!

42:35.726 --> 42:38.894
Let me go!

42:38.896 --> 42:40.395
It's a couple hundred miles

42:40.397 --> 42:43.464
between the two possible locations.

42:43.466 --> 42:45.967
We have no choice but to split up.

42:45.969 --> 42:48.003
Clay, you and Paige go in one car,

42:48.005 --> 42:50.238
the rest of us will go in the other.

42:58.313 --> 43:01.115
When are you going to
tell Paige the truth?

43:03.519 --> 43:06.320
That Aleister is your son.

43:06.322 --> 43:09.823
I've hardly been able
to admit that to myself.

43:09.825 --> 43:11.992
He shouldn't have survived.

43:13.161 --> 43:14.394
But he did.

43:19.834 --> 43:21.669
Let me go!

43:21.671 --> 43:23.603
Let yourself go.

43:23.605 --> 43:25.439
I am the lock.

43:25.441 --> 43:27.074
(Relenting sigh)

43:27.076 --> 43:29.176
And I am the key.

43:29.178 --> 43:30.410
Your attendant...

43:31.612 --> 43:34.214
Let your fear go. Send it out to her.

43:34.216 --> 43:35.648
Left hand this time.

43:38.453 --> 43:40.887
<i>Dies coartati.</i>

43:40.889 --> 43:42.088
(Gasping)

43:44.424 --> 43:47.293
You are all-powerful. Keep focusing.

43:49.496 --> 43:50.663
Do it.

43:51.966 --> 43:53.165
Don't stop.

43:54.468 --> 44:02.468
( ♪ )

44:02.477 --> 44:05.478
Aleister: Today, you are a full witch.

44:05.480 --> 44:06.645
(Gasping)

44:06.647 --> 44:08.514
You will never be afraid again.

44:08.516 --> 44:10.882
And today, everything changes.

44:12.085 --> 44:13.752
Today...

44:13.754 --> 44:16.287
is the beginning of the end.
