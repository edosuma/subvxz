01:30.591 --> 01:33.464

REMAINS VERY MUCH IN QUESTION

01:33.464 --> 01:35.266

01:35.266 --> 01:36.567
YEAH, I'LL SAY.

STEER CLEAR OF CHARLOTTE.

02:12.863 --> 02:14.665

02:18.509 --> 02:20.171

CELL BLOCK.

02:20.171 --> 02:21.512
I'VE IDENTIFIED EVERYONE
WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE RIOTS

02:21.512 --> 02:23.574

WAS MURDERED.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.188
CONRAD SAID ON THE PHONE,

02:37.188 --> 02:39.330
"I'M SORRY TO PUT US
IN THIS POSITION AGAIN."

02:39.330 --> 02:41.232

TO SILENCE HIM,

02:41.232 --> 02:42.693
IT'S A VERY STRONG POSSIBILITY

02:42.693 --> 02:44.565

TO MY FATHER.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.267
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO NOW?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.269

03:18.229 --> 03:19.570
I'D HAVE VOLUNTEERED

05:07.608 --> 05:10.411
NO.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.783

05:34.405 --> 05:35.366

05:37.568 --> 05:38.769

05:38.769 --> 05:39.940
The photograph isn't
the point, Nolan.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.472
It's the journal and the fact

10:20.751 --> 10:21.922
(knock on door)

10:21.922 --> 10:22.893
(cell phone beeps)

10:28.959 --> 10:29.930
JACK.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.101
HEY.

10:31.101 --> 10:33.133
HEY. COME ON IN.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.065
HOW ARE YOU?

10:35.065 --> 10:36.036
(chuckles)

10:36.036 --> 10:38.638
ACTUALLY, THAT WAS GONNA BE
MY QUESTION TO YOU.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.210
CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

10:40.210 --> 10:44.745
NO, I'M FINE.
THANK YOU.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.046
(sighs) IT CAN'T BE EASY,

10:46.046 --> 10:48.148
WAITING TO HEAR ABOUT
DANIEL'S FATE.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.981
NO. NO,
NONE OF IT'S EASY.

10:50.981 --> 10:53.754
YOU'D THINK THAT
A WRITTEN CONFESSION BY SOMEONE

10:53.754 --> 10:56.426
WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE JUDGE
TO DROP THE CHARGES, BUT...

10:56.426 --> 10:58.288
NOT TO MENTION
THE BLOODY HOODIE

10:58.288 --> 11:00.290
THEY FOUND
IN HIS POSSESSION.

11:03.393 --> 11:05.365
IT'S KIND OF AMAZING...

11:05.365 --> 11:07.297
THE WAY IT ALL WORKED OUT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

11:07.297 --> 11:09.770
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

11:09.770 --> 11:11.441
JUST...

11:11.441 --> 11:15.175
THE GRAYSONS
ARE VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.178
MAYBE THE PROTESTERS AREN'T
AS FAR OFF AS YOU MIGHT THINK.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.380
JACK,
DANIEL DIDN'T KILL TYLER.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.382
I'M NOT SAYING THAT HE DID.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.915
THEN WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

11:24.915 --> 11:26.386
THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT

11:26.386 --> 11:28.859
BEFORE MARRYING INTO
THAT FAMILY.

11:28.859 --> 11:30.460
(sighs)

11:33.163 --> 11:36.096
(sighs) EMILY, THERE'S
SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.228
(cell phone rings)

11:38.228 --> 11:39.699
(ring)

11:39.699 --> 11:41.201
OH, EXCUSE ME.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.432
(ring)

11:42.432 --> 11:44.204
(beeps)

11:44.204 --> 11:46.076
HELLO.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.339
THEY DROPPED ALL CHARGES.
 (protesters shout indistinctly)

11:49.339 --> 11:52.342
OH, THANK GOD.

11:52.342 --> 11:54.044
Okay, I'll be right there.

11:54.044 --> 11:55.015
(beep)

11:57.117 --> 11:58.318
JACK, I'M...

11:58.318 --> 12:00.951
SOUNDS LIKE GOOD NEWS.
YOU SHOULD GO GET HIM.

12:00.951 --> 12:03.023
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

12:03.023 --> 12:06.156
NO, NO, I'M SORRY.
I PRACTICALLY AMBUSHED YOU.

12:06.156 --> 12:08.058
WE CAN TALK LATER.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.877
YOU'VE HAD MY BUSINESS CARD
FOR OVER SIX MONTHS.

12:26.877 --> 12:29.019
TIMING IS EVERYTHING,
MR. McGOWEN.

12:29.019 --> 12:32.022
AND NOW THAT YOU'VE CASHED OUT
YOUR SHARES OF GRAYSON GLOBAL,

12:32.022 --> 12:33.824
IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME

12:33.824 --> 12:36.056
THAT THE STARS ARE
PROPERLY ALIGNED FOR YOU?

12:36.056 --> 12:37.888
NEARLY.

12:37.888 --> 12:40.160
I WANT FULL IMMUNITY
IN EXCHANGE

12:40.160 --> 12:42.933
FOR THE INFORMATION
I'M ABOUT TO GIVE YOU.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.094
I CAN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING

12:44.094 --> 12:45.936
TILL I KNOW
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

12:45.936 --> 12:47.397
IF YOU CAN'T
OFFER ME PROTECTION,

12:47.397 --> 12:49.970
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO GO
TO YOUR SUPERIORS AT THE S.E.C.,

12:49.970 --> 12:53.343
OR TO THE DIRECTOR
OF THE FBI, THE CIA,

12:53.343 --> 12:56.046
OR ANY OTHER AGENCY
WHO WOULD LIKE TO LAY CLAIM

12:56.046 --> 13:00.210
TO THE CONVICTION
OF A DOMESTIC TERRORIST.

13:00.210 --> 13:01.912
A TERRORIST?

13:01.912 --> 13:03.053
I THOUGHT YOU HAD INFORMATION

13:03.053 --> 13:04.384
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND'S
CORPORATE MALFEASANCE.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.257
IN THIS CASE, MR. McGOWEN,
THEY'RE ONE AND THE SAME.

13:07.257 --> 13:11.491
NOW DO WE HAVE A DEAL
OR NOT?

13:11.491 --> 13:13.423
LET ME MAKE A PHONE CALL.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.102
(protesters
shouting indistinctly)

13:24.234 --> 13:26.136
(buzzer sounds)

13:26.136 --> 13:27.838
(lock clicks, door creaks)

13:27.838 --> 13:29.379
DANIEL.

13:29.379 --> 13:33.343
(shouting continues)

13:36.046 --> 13:39.189
(protesters
shouting indistinctly)

13:39.189 --> 13:42.953
(camera shutters clicking)

13:42.953 --> 13:47.027
(shouting continues)

13:47.027 --> 13:50.100
(clicking continues)

13:50.100 --> 13:53.103
(shouting continues)

13:53.103 --> 13:56.106
(clicking continues)

13:56.106 --> 13:59.940
(crowd chanting)
MURDERER! MURDERER! MURDERER!

13:59.940 --> 14:02.112
(clicking continues)

14:06.917 --> 14:08.848
YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.621
YOU'VE BARELY SAID
TWO WORDS.

14:11.621 --> 14:14.254
SORRY ABOUT YOUR CAR.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.957
THIS WILL EVENTUALLY
DIE DOWN.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.959
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.390
CONGRATULATIONS, SON.

14:20.390 --> 14:21.932
WELCOME HOME.

14:21.932 --> 14:23.393
WELCOME HOME, DANIEL.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.937
(Victoria) DANIEL.

14:26.937 --> 14:29.399
OHH.

14:29.399 --> 14:31.171
THANK GOD IT'S FINALLY OVER.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.143
NO, THIS IS A LONG WAY
FROM OVER.

14:33.143 --> 14:35.645
DANIEL'S A LITTLE SHAKEN.

14:35.645 --> 14:37.277
SOMEBODY SPRAY PAINTED
"MURDERER" ON MY CAR

14:37.277 --> 14:38.448
OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON.

14:38.448 --> 14:39.609
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

14:39.609 --> 14:40.981
YEAH,
THE PRESS WERE PRACTICALLY

14:40.981 --> 14:42.112
HANDING OUT PITCHFORKS
AT THE GATE.

14:42.112 --> 14:43.353
(Ashley) HE'S NOT FAR OFF.

14:43.353 --> 14:44.915
"THE TIMES" ARE QUESTIONING

14:44.915 --> 14:46.586
THE VERACITY OF THE CONFESSION,

14:46.586 --> 14:48.488
"PAGE SIX" IS RUNNING
A FULL-PAGE CHRONICLE

14:48.488 --> 14:51.061
OF DANIEL'S
PAST PARTY-BOY WAYS,

14:51.061 --> 14:52.522
AND TREADWELL'S
ANTI-GRAYSON BLOG

14:52.522 --> 14:54.564
IS BEING RERUN
IN EVERY MAJOR NEWSPAPER.

14:54.564 --> 14:57.027
THIS STORY ISN'T DYING DOWN
ANY TIME SOON.

14:57.027 --> 14:58.929
WELL, THEN WE'LL STARVE
THE BEAST.

14:58.929 --> 15:01.071
DANIEL HAS NOTHING TO HIDE.

15:01.071 --> 15:02.902
I THINK THE BEST THING
FOR HIM TO DO

15:02.902 --> 15:05.175
WOULD BE TO GET IN FRONT
OF THE CAMERAS, TELL HIS STORY.

15:05.175 --> 15:06.436
SHE'S RIGHT.

15:06.436 --> 15:08.378
THE BEST WAY TO HIT THIS
IS HEAD-ON.

15:08.378 --> 15:09.539
WELL, ALL THE MAJORS

15:09.539 --> 15:11.081
ARE PRACTICALLY
BANGING DOWN THE DOOR--

15:11.081 --> 15:13.243
"NIGHTLINE,"
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA."

15:13.243 --> 15:14.584
WE CAN HAVE OUR PICK.

15:14.584 --> 15:16.086
LISTEN, I HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN OVER 48 HOURS.

15:16.086 --> 15:18.989
I-I CAN'T MAKE
THAT DECISION RIGHT NOW.

15:18.989 --> 15:20.320
I'M GONNA CRASH
FOR A WHILE, OKAY?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.052
YEAH, OF COURSE.
YOU NEED SOME REST.

15:22.052 --> 15:23.393
SOMEONE TELL CHARLOTTE

15:23.393 --> 15:25.055
I'LL GIVE HER A BIG HUG
WHEN I WAKE UP.

15:25.055 --> 15:27.527
SWEET DREAMS, DARLING.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.699
YOU DESERVE THEM.

15:29.699 --> 15:31.201
(Ashley) VICTORIA, COULD I
TALK WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT?

15:31.201 --> 15:33.133
OF COURSE.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.604
I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU ALL TOMORROW.

15:34.604 --> 15:36.406
(Victoria) YES.

15:43.073 --> 15:45.675
WHAT IS IT, ASHLEY?

15:45.675 --> 15:47.677
NOW THAT DANIEL'S BEEN
OFFICIALLY RELEASED,

15:47.677 --> 15:49.980
I'D LIKE TO FORMALLY
GIVE MY NOTICE.

15:49.980 --> 15:51.381
OF COURSE.

15:51.381 --> 15:53.623
I HAD NO DELUSIONS THAT YOU
WOULD RETURN TO PARTY PLANNING

15:53.623 --> 15:57.657
AFTER YOU SO APTLY SHOWCASED
YOUR OTHER TALENTS. (chuckles)

15:57.657 --> 15:59.159
UNFORTUNATELY,
I WON'T HAVE TIME

15:59.159 --> 16:00.991
TO FIND YOU
A SUITABLE REPLACEMENT.

16:00.991 --> 16:03.433
OH, THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.
(chuckles)

16:03.433 --> 16:04.964
THE HAMPTONS ARE FILTHY

16:04.964 --> 16:06.966
WITH AMBITIOUS YOUNG GIRLS
LIKE YOURSELF.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.668
MAY I ASK
WHERE YOU'VE LANDED?

16:08.668 --> 16:11.601
MR. BROOKS HAS OFFERED ME
A MEDIA RELATIONS POSITION

16:11.601 --> 16:13.273
AT HIS LAW FIRM.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.045
AH, WELL...

16:15.045 --> 16:17.307
AS MR. BROOKS IS STILL
ON RETAINER TO US,

16:17.307 --> 16:20.380
I WOULD LIKE
TO ASK YOU A FAVOR.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.283
IF DANIEL DOES INDEED GRANT
THIS ILL-ADVISED INTERVIEW,

16:23.283 --> 16:25.155
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO REMAIN
AS OUR MEDIA LIAISON

16:25.155 --> 16:26.416
UNTIL IT'S OVER.

16:26.416 --> 16:28.218
THAT'S THE LEAST
I CAN DO FOR DANIEL

16:28.218 --> 16:31.021
AFTER ALL HE'S DONE
FOR ME.

16:49.079 --> 16:51.010
(drawer clanks)

17:04.194 --> 17:07.097
(keypad beeps)

17:07.097 --> 17:08.558
(phone rings, line clicks)

17:08.558 --> 17:10.200
(man) Lyle Jameson.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.560
DOCTOR, UH,

17:11.560 --> 17:13.203
THIS IS EVE TUCKER
AT NEW MERCY HOSPITAL.

17:13.203 --> 17:15.065
WE'RE UPDATING OUR SYSTEM,

17:15.065 --> 17:17.267
AND I NEEDED
TO CROSS-CHECK OUR RECORDS

17:17.267 --> 17:20.140
BEFORE CONFIRMING CAUSE OF DEATH
OF A PATIENT WE SHARED.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.641
HER NAME IS CAROLE MILLER.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.314
I'm afraid I don't
recognize the name.

17:24.314 --> 17:26.476
PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

17:26.476 --> 17:28.318
SHE DIED HERE IN 2002,

17:28.318 --> 17:30.320
BUT IT HAS YOU LISTED

17:30.320 --> 17:33.253
AS HER PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN
IN LANCASTER.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.255
UM... 5'5",

17:35.255 --> 17:38.828
BORN IN 1950,

17:38.828 --> 17:40.760
TYPE 2 DIABETIC.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.692
I have a Carole Thomas
matching that description,

17:42.692 --> 17:44.794
but she's alive and well.

17:44.794 --> 17:47.367
That must have been
a clerical error.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.569
YES, IT MUST HAVE BEEN.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.601
THANK YOU.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.321
(woman) CAN I HELP YOU?

18:11.321 --> 18:13.193
CAROLE MILLER?

18:13.193 --> 18:15.525
YOU HAVE THE WRONG HOUSE.

18:15.525 --> 18:18.328
I DON'T THINK SO,
MS. MILLER.

18:18.328 --> 18:19.669
ALISON RODNER FROM

18:19.669 --> 18:21.801
THE DEPARTMENT
OF HOMELAND SECURITY.

18:21.801 --> 18:25.405
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT CONRAD GRAYSON.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.478
(clicks)

18:29.809 --> 18:31.481
YOU WORKED FOR GRAYSON GLOBAL

18:31.481 --> 18:32.812
AS CONRAD GRAYSON'S
PERSONAL SECRETARY

18:32.812 --> 18:34.514
FOR 18 YEARS,
IS THAT RIGHT?

18:34.514 --> 18:36.216
WELL, YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT

18:36.216 --> 18:38.218
OR YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.150
ALL RIGHT THEN.

18:40.150 --> 18:42.121
WHAT WAS THE NATURE
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP

18:42.121 --> 18:43.553
WITH DAVID CLARKE?

18:43.553 --> 18:45.295
THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP.

18:45.295 --> 18:48.258
HE WORKED FOR MR. GRAYSON,
NOT ME.

18:48.258 --> 18:50.330
WERE YOU SURPRISED TO HEAR
THAT HE WAS CONVICTED

18:50.330 --> 18:52.502
FOR THE DOWNING
OF FLIGHT 197?

18:52.502 --> 18:55.535
NO ONE SAW THAT COMING.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.538
BUT YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

18:58.538 --> 19:01.241
UM, DO YOU TAKE SUGAR
WITH YOUR TEA?

19:01.241 --> 19:02.842
NO.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.715
(gun racks)

19:05.715 --> 19:07.347
NOW...

19:07.347 --> 19:09.549
LET ME SEE THAT I.D.
OF YOURS AGAIN,

19:09.549 --> 19:12.482
AND LET'S VERIFY THAT YOU ARE
WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE.

19:12.482 --> 19:13.823
(Nolan) NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:13.823 --> 19:15.385
AUNT CAROLE,

19:15.385 --> 19:17.257
JUST... PUT DOWN THE GUN.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.189
AUNT CAROLE?

19:19.189 --> 19:21.160
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.462
(clears throat)

19:22.462 --> 19:25.295
AUNT CAROLE,
MEET, UH...

19:25.295 --> 19:28.298
AMANDA CLARKE,

19:28.298 --> 19:30.270
DAVID CLARKE'S DAUGHTER.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.611
(Nolan) LOOK,
AFTER I DROPPED OUT OF M.I.T.

19:41.611 --> 19:45.415
AND MY OLD MAN
KICKED ME TO THE CURB,

19:45.415 --> 19:47.417
AUNT CAROLE TOOK ME IN.

19:47.417 --> 19:49.589
SHE WAS THE ONE THAT
INTRODUCED ME TO YOUR DAD.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.561
AND THEN YOU BETRAYED HIM.

19:51.561 --> 19:52.962
NO, SHE DIDN'T.

19:52.962 --> 19:54.724
SHE WAS ALWAYS ON HIS SIDE.

19:54.724 --> 19:56.266
NOLAN CAME TO ME

19:56.266 --> 19:58.328
AND TOLD ME HE HAD FORMED
A BOND WITH DAVID

19:58.328 --> 20:00.400
WHILE HE WAS IN PRISON

20:00.400 --> 20:02.732
AND THAT HE BELIEVED THAT
YOUR FATHER HAD BEEN SET UP.

20:02.732 --> 20:05.435
SO I STARTED INVESTIGATING
GRAYSON GLOBAL

20:05.435 --> 20:07.407
FROM THE INSIDE OUT,

20:07.407 --> 20:09.639
AND THAT LED ME TO A MAN
NAMED ROGER HALSTED.

20:09.639 --> 20:11.541
GRAYSON'S SENIOR ACCOUNTANT.

20:11.541 --> 20:12.882
YES, HE'S THE ONE

20:12.882 --> 20:15.445
THAT DISCOVERED
THE DISCREPANCIES IN THE BOOKS

20:15.445 --> 20:17.447
THAT CONNECTED CONRAD
TO THE TERRORISTS.

20:17.447 --> 20:18.948
YEAH, I KNOW WHO HE IS.

20:18.948 --> 20:22.552
HE THOUGHT HE HAD
ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO HANG CONRAD

20:22.552 --> 20:23.923
AND EXONERATE YOUR FATHER.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.455
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU?

20:25.455 --> 20:27.457
WE NEVER GOT THE CHANCE.

20:27.457 --> 20:29.599
WHEN I WENT TO THE PRISON
TO TELL YOUR DAD

20:29.599 --> 20:31.601
WHAT CAROLE HAD LEARNED,

20:31.601 --> 20:35.335
THEY WERE ALREADY IN LOCKDOWN.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.407
DAVID HAD JUST BEEN KILLED.

20:37.407 --> 20:39.269
CAROLE, IT'S ME.

20:39.269 --> 20:41.411
I need you to do
exactly as I say.

20:41.411 --> 20:43.373
GET UP
AND WALK AWAY FROM YOUR DESK.

20:43.373 --> 20:44.874
Do not take your purse.

20:44.874 --> 20:46.716
Just act like you're walking
down the hall. Do it now!

20:46.716 --> 20:48.448
YOU'RE SCARING ME.
 Good.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.649
GET IN A CAB AND TAKE IT

20:49.649 --> 20:51.951
straight to that place
we went that one summer,

20:51.951 --> 20:53.453
with the horses.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.955
Do not stop off
at your apartment.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.687
I'LL BE WAITING
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.430
SO...

21:00.430 --> 21:02.292
HE SAVED MY LIFE.

21:02.292 --> 21:04.694
BY FAKING YOUR DEATH.

21:04.694 --> 21:06.896
TELL HER ABOUT
THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN.

21:06.896 --> 21:09.839
THERE WAS A MAN
WHO VISITED GRAYSON

21:09.839 --> 21:11.371
A HANDFUL OF TIMES.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.703
NOW THESE MEETINGS
WERE ALWAYS OFF THE BOOKS.

21:13.703 --> 21:17.507
THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM
WAS A YEAR TO THE DAY

21:17.507 --> 21:19.309
BEFORE THAT PLANE WENT DOWN.

21:19.309 --> 21:20.750
THE LAST TIME

21:20.750 --> 21:23.513
WAS THE MORNING
YOUR FATHER DIED.

21:23.513 --> 21:25.014
DO YOU REMEMBER HIS NAME?

21:25.014 --> 21:27.056
HE NEVER GAVE IT.

21:27.056 --> 21:29.689
BUT I WILL NEVER
FORGET HIS FACE.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.991
HE HAD A FULL HEAD
OF WHITE HAIR

21:31.991 --> 21:33.493
AND ICE-BLUE EYES,

21:33.493 --> 21:36.626
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING
SO TERRIFYING ABOUT HIM.

21:36.626 --> 21:40.330
AND I KNOW HE FRIGHTENED CONRAD
EVEN IN THE BRIGHT OF DAY.

21:40.330 --> 21:43.703
(tea kettle whistling)

21:48.338 --> 21:49.479
EMS...

21:49.479 --> 21:50.810
(whistling stops)

21:50.810 --> 21:52.612
I'M SORRY.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.615
BUT I COULD NOT GIVE YOU
THAT LAST JOURNAL.

21:55.615 --> 21:58.418
THIS IS BIGGER TO ME
THAN YOUR REVENGE

21:58.418 --> 22:00.319
AGAINST THE GRAYSONS.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.622
THIS IS MY--
 FAMILY.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.594
I KNOW.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.598
I WOULD'VE DONE ANYTHING
TO PROTECT MINE, TOO.

22:14.904 --> 22:18.007
(knock on door)

22:22.372 --> 22:23.973
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:23.973 --> 22:26.546
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THIS.

22:27.677 --> 22:29.549
MY PHONE?

22:29.549 --> 22:30.850
HOW DID YOU GET THIS?

22:30.850 --> 22:34.053
I TOOK IT OUT OF TYLER'S JACKET
THE NIGHT HE WAS MURDERED.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.025
(closes door)
 WHAT?

22:36.025 --> 22:38.588
I'M THE ONE WHO DRAGGED
HIS BODY UP THE BEACH.

22:38.588 --> 22:40.129
ARE YOU ALSO THE ONE
WHO HIT ME?

22:40.129 --> 22:41.461
NO.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.632
AND I DIDN'T SEE
WHAT HAPPENED.

22:42.632 --> 22:43.733
I HEARD GUNSHOTS
AND I WENT TO THE WATER,

22:43.733 --> 22:45.435
AND TYLER WAS LYING THERE.

22:45.435 --> 22:47.066
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU, AND THEN
I HEARD CHARLOTTE AND DECLAN,

22:47.066 --> 22:49.068
AND I... I PANICKED.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.500
(sighs)

22:50.500 --> 22:52.842
WELL, SO MUCH
FOR YOUR STAND-UP IMAGE.

22:52.842 --> 22:54.544
YOU WERE JUST
GONNA LET 'EM FRY ME?

22:54.544 --> 22:55.845
(sighs) I TOLD YOU,

22:55.845 --> 22:58.678
I DON'T KNOW
WHO KILLED TYLER.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.680
BUT I DO KNOW
ONE THING FOR CERTAIN--

23:00.680 --> 23:02.782
THE BLOODY HOODIE THEY FOUND
IN LEE MORAN'S CAR

23:02.782 --> 23:04.854
DIDN'T BELONG TO LEE MORAN.

23:04.854 --> 23:06.385
IT BELONGED TO ME.

23:08.618 --> 23:10.119
I THINK YOUR PARENTS

23:10.119 --> 23:12.662
HIRED HIM TO BREAK IN
AND STEAL IT FROM ME.

23:12.662 --> 23:14.664
AND THEN WHAT, CONVINCED HIM
TO CONFESS TO THE CRIME

23:14.664 --> 23:16.596
AND HANG HIMSELF?

23:18.568 --> 23:20.670
(sighs)

23:20.670 --> 23:23.503
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

23:23.503 --> 23:25.004
(sighs)

23:25.004 --> 23:27.537
'CAUSE EMILY TRUSTS YOU.

23:27.537 --> 23:29.979
AND IF SHE'S GONNA SPEND
HER LIFE WITH YOU,

23:29.979 --> 23:33.683
YOU OWE IT TO HER
NOT TO IGNORE THIS.

23:41.190 --> 23:43.022
(clicks)

23:43.022 --> 23:44.724
(indistinct conversations)

23:44.724 --> 23:46.556
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:46.556 --> 23:48.528
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT.

23:48.528 --> 23:49.659
(pills rattle)

23:49.659 --> 23:52.632
YOU MIGHT WANT TO DIAL BACK
ON THAT INDIGNATION.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.564
YOU JUST VIOLATED
THE HONOR CODE

23:54.564 --> 23:56.966
NOT TO MENTION STATE LAW.

23:56.966 --> 23:58.938
YOU SET ME UP.
 CHARLOTTE, YOU NEED HELP.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.209
YOU'RE PATHETIC!

24:00.209 --> 24:01.541
IF I'M GETTING KICKED OUT
OF THIS SCHOOL,

24:01.541 --> 24:02.872
SO ARE YOU.

24:02.872 --> 24:04.944
I'M TELLING MY DAD TO PULL
YOUR TUITION NEXT SEMESTER.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.115
YOU'RE DONE HERE.

24:06.115 --> 24:07.477
THAT'S ENOUGH. COME ON.

24:07.477 --> 24:08.648
DON'T TOUCH ME!

24:08.648 --> 24:10.650
(indistinct conversations
continue)

24:14.153 --> 24:17.987
MR. BROOKS, I THOUGHT
YOUR WORK HERE WAS FINISHED.

24:17.987 --> 24:19.158
NEARLY.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.790
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT UPSET
THAT I AGREED

24:20.790 --> 24:22.492
TO STAY AND WORK
WITH THE GRAYSONS

24:22.492 --> 24:23.763
THROUGH DANIEL'S
TELEVISION INTERVIEW.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.464
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO START FULL-TIME

24:25.464 --> 24:27.036
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

24:27.036 --> 24:28.738
I'M AFRAID THAT OFFER

24:28.738 --> 24:30.770
IS NO LONGER ON THE TABLE,
ASHLEY.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.702
WHY?

24:32.702 --> 24:34.604
VICTORIA WARNED ME
YOU WERE A LITTLE TRICKY,

24:34.604 --> 24:36.606
SO I DID SOME DIGGING,

24:36.606 --> 24:38.548
AND I KNOW YOU LEAKED
THOSE PHOTOS OF DANIEL

24:38.548 --> 24:39.679
TO THE PRESS.

24:39.679 --> 24:42.612
I DID WHAT ANYONE WOULD DO.

24:42.612 --> 24:45.855
YOU CAN'T GET BEYOND WORKING FOR
SOMEONE LIKE VICTORIA GRAYSON

24:45.855 --> 24:47.987
WITHOUT BREAKING A FEW RULES.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.659
I'M SORRY.

24:49.659 --> 24:51.721
I WASTE ENOUGH TIME SIFTING
THROUGH MY CLIENTS' LIES.

24:51.721 --> 24:56.766
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN DOING
THE SAME WITH MY EMPLOYEES.

24:56.766 --> 25:00.229
(cell phone rings)

25:00.229 --> 25:01.601
(ring)

25:01.601 --> 25:02.732
(beeps)

25:04.273 --> 25:05.935
GRAYSON.

25:05.935 --> 25:08.077
(woman) The feds
are here, Mr. Grayson.

25:08.077 --> 25:10.710
THE FEDS?
WHAT DO THEY WANT?

25:10.710 --> 25:13.643
They came with a warrant
to seize everything.

25:13.643 --> 25:15.785
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
EVERYTHING?

25:15.785 --> 25:17.116
By whose authority?

25:17.116 --> 25:19.018
BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE
OF THE UNITED STATES.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.622
THIS IS AGENT McGOWEN
OF THE S.E.C., MR. GRAYSON.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.153
I suggest you set aside
tomorrow morning

25:24.153 --> 25:25.655
to come down
to the Federal Building

25:25.655 --> 25:27.226
and answer some questions.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.898
YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO BRING YOUR LAWYER.

25:28.898 --> 25:30.059
(police radio chatter)

25:41.110 --> 25:42.772
DANIEL.

25:42.772 --> 25:44.273
I THOUGHT YOU'D
STILL BE HOME SLEEPING.

25:44.273 --> 25:45.645
MM.

25:45.645 --> 25:48.678
I THINK I'VE BEEN ASLEEP
LONG ENOUGH.

25:48.678 --> 25:49.979
COME HERE.

25:55.825 --> 25:58.758
HEY.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.590
YOU'RE STILL WEARING IT.

26:00.590 --> 26:02.832
OF COURSE I AM.

26:02.832 --> 26:05.134
WHY, ARE YOU HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS?

26:05.134 --> 26:07.066
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.738
SO MUCH HAS CHANGED.

26:10.199 --> 26:11.841
NOT TO ME.

26:15.344 --> 26:18.207
WHAT IF THOSE PROTESTERS
WERE RIGHT?

26:18.207 --> 26:21.681
WHAT IF I DIDN'T DESERVE
THAT REPRIEVE?

26:21.681 --> 26:23.312
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:24.754 --> 26:25.915
WHAT IF LEE MORAN

26:25.915 --> 26:28.057
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH TYLER'S DEATH?

26:28.057 --> 26:29.759
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

26:29.759 --> 26:31.791
WHY WOULD A CAREER CRIMINAL
WHO'S BOLD ENOUGH

26:31.791 --> 26:33.793
TO EXTORT MY PARENTS
AND SET ME UP FOR MURDER

26:33.793 --> 26:35.765
SUDDENLY HAVE
A CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE?

26:35.765 --> 26:37.096
I DON'T KNOW.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.898
MAYBE HE FINALLY REALIZED
HE WAS IN OVER HIS HEAD.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.930
MAYBE.

26:42.872 --> 26:45.604
I DECIDED TO DO
THAT INTERVIEW TOMORROW.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.877
YOU DID?

26:47.877 --> 26:50.740
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

26:52.712 --> 26:55.214
MY PARENTS RAISED ME
TO BE A GRAYSON,

26:55.214 --> 26:56.986
TO PUT MY NAME
BEFORE EVERYTHING,

26:56.986 --> 26:58.848
INCLUDING THE TRUTH.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.352
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
THAT GUY, DANIEL.

27:03.352 --> 27:05.354
MAYBE THIS INTERVIEW'S
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU

27:05.354 --> 27:06.896
TO BE HONEST,

27:06.896 --> 27:08.898
SEPARATE YOURSELF
FROM YOUR NAME.

27:08.898 --> 27:10.259
AND IF IT CREATES A BIT
OF HEALTHY DISTANCE

27:10.259 --> 27:11.630
FROM YOUR PARENTS,

27:11.630 --> 27:12.802
THEN ALL THE BETTER.

27:16.806 --> 27:18.137
(kisses)

27:25.915 --> 27:27.747
I'LL GO GRAB MY STUFF.

27:27.747 --> 27:28.748
OKAY.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.791
(Daniel) YOU'RE STILL UP?

27:41.791 --> 27:43.993
I THOUGHT YOU'D GONE
TO EMILY'S.

27:43.993 --> 27:45.995
I CAME BACK TO PICK UP
MY THINGS,

27:45.995 --> 27:48.698
SAW YOUR LIGHT WAS ON.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.101
YOU ALL RIGHT?

27:53.873 --> 27:56.205
UH, NO.

27:56.205 --> 27:58.978
I AM MOST DEFINITELY

27:58.978 --> 28:01.050
NOT ALL RIGHT.

28:02.812 --> 28:04.754
IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK,

28:04.754 --> 28:06.055
BUT OUR FAMILY
IS ON THE VERGE

28:06.055 --> 28:09.288
OF ABSOLUTE CATASTROPHE,
DANIEL.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.861
AND I'D BET THE HOUSE,
IF MY NAME WERE STILL ON IT,

28:11.861 --> 28:14.223
THAT YOUR MOTHER
HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THAT.

28:14.223 --> 28:15.394
THAT'S ENOUGH, DAD.

28:15.394 --> 28:16.926
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF THE TWO OF YOU

28:16.926 --> 28:18.397
PLAYING ME
AGAINST THE OTHER.

28:20.269 --> 28:23.132
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

28:23.132 --> 28:25.304
YOU'VE BEEN A PAWN
IN OUR DECREPIT MARRIAGE

28:25.304 --> 28:26.806
FOR FAR TOO LONG.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.037
I-I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

28:28.037 --> 28:29.779
NO, WHAT YOU OWE ME
IS THE TRUTH.

28:31.140 --> 28:33.712
(chuckles)

28:33.712 --> 28:34.944
(scoffs)

28:34.944 --> 28:36.786
(glass scrapes desk)

28:36.786 --> 28:38.848
THE TRUTH.

28:38.848 --> 28:40.019
(liquid pours)

28:40.019 --> 28:41.350
(Conrad)
DO YOU KNOW WHY THE JUDGE

28:41.350 --> 28:42.822
SO KINDLY GRANTED YOU
HOUSE ARREST

28:42.822 --> 28:45.194
INSTEAD OF KEEPING YOU
AT RIKERS?

28:45.194 --> 28:47.957
YEAH, I NEARLY GOT
BEAT TO DEATH.

28:49.999 --> 28:52.731
AND DO YOU ALSO KNOW
THAT YOUR MOTHER PAID SOMEONE

28:52.731 --> 28:55.034
TO ARRANGE THAT BEATING?

29:02.972 --> 29:05.014
(exhales)

29:05.014 --> 29:07.847
LEE MORAN.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.248
(huffs)

29:09.248 --> 29:11.750
YEAH.

29:13.452 --> 29:18.087
THE CONFESSION HE WROTE
WASN'T REAL, WAS IT?

29:18.087 --> 29:19.989
NO.

29:22.131 --> 29:25.865
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
HAVE HIM KILLED.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.436
NO, THE KID
WAS IN TOO DEEP.

29:27.436 --> 29:29.168
DAD, COME ON.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.870
IF HE'D STARTED TALKING,
HE WOULD'VE DESTROYED US ALL.
 OH, COME ON.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.071
I COULDN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.943
I DO WHAT I NEED TO DO
TO PROTECT THE FAMILY.

29:33.943 --> 29:36.505
I ALWAYS HAVE.

29:38.247 --> 29:39.979
WHAT DID YOU DO?

29:41.550 --> 29:44.783
BEFORE I TELL YOU, I NEED YOU
TO PROMISE ONE THING...

29:44.783 --> 29:46.785
THAT WHEN THEY FINALLY
COME TO GET ME,

29:46.785 --> 29:49.088
THAT YOU WILL DO WHATEVER YOU
CAN TO REBUILD THE COMPANY

29:49.088 --> 29:51.861
AND TAKE CARE
OF YOUR LITTLE SISTER.

29:51.861 --> 29:53.963
I PROMISE.

29:55.364 --> 29:57.196
WOULD YOU CLOSE THE DOORS?

30:06.135 --> 30:08.978
(Conrad) IN ORDER
FOR ANY OF THIS TO MAKE SENSE,

30:08.978 --> 30:10.910
I NEED TO START
AT THE BEGINNING...

30:10.910 --> 30:13.442
WITH DAVID CLARKE

30:13.442 --> 30:18.417
AND WHAT WE DID TO HIM
AND HIS INNOCENT BABY GIRL.

30:22.952 --> 30:24.123
(knock on door)

30:25.895 --> 30:27.326
CHARLOTTE.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.398
WHATEVER YOU WANT, MOM,
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

30:29.398 --> 30:31.500
I'M ALREADY LATE FOR SCHOOL.

30:33.863 --> 30:36.835
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE HEADMASTER.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.238
HE TOLD ME
ABOUT THE SUSPENSION.

30:42.872 --> 30:44.874
I GUESS WE CAN ADD
"TEEN PILL POPPER"

30:44.874 --> 30:46.415
TO THE GRAYSON BOOK OF SHAME.

30:46.415 --> 30:48.477
THIS IS NO LAUGHING MATTER,
CHARLOTTE.

30:48.477 --> 30:51.380
DO YOU SEE ME LAUGHING?

30:53.582 --> 30:56.055
(voice breaking)
I SEE YOU IN PAIN.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.391
HOW CAN I HELP YOU
IF YOU DON'T LET ME?

31:02.391 --> 31:05.394
I TRIED TO LET YOU, MOM.
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED.

31:07.997 --> 31:09.999
WHATEVER ANSWERS
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

31:09.999 --> 31:12.241
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FIND THEM
IN A BOTTLE OF PILLS.

31:12.241 --> 31:13.642
AND YOU'RE NOT CERTAINLY
NOT GOING TO FIND THEM

31:13.642 --> 31:16.375

WANTING TO BE YOUR OWN MAN--

32:25.074 --> 32:28.417

IS NO BETTER THAN MY D.N.A.?

33:07.186 --> 33:09.588

A LOT FARTHER TO FALL.

33:11.160 --> 33:13.162

33:14.763 --> 33:17.026

GRANT ME HOUSE ARREST

33:17.026 --> 33:19.098

IN PRISON?

33:19.098 --> 33:20.769

48 HOURS AGO.

34:27.496 --> 34:30.199
JUST FOR THE RECORD,

34:30.199 --> 34:33.202
DID YOU MURDER
TYLER BARROL?

34:33.202 --> 34:36.205
TYLER THREATENED
MY WHOLE FAMILY.

34:36.205 --> 34:38.447
WE STRUGGLED
FOR CONTROL OF THE GUN,

34:38.447 --> 34:40.149
IT WENT OFF, AND...

34:40.149 --> 34:41.850

I WAS KNOCKED OUT

LEE AND TYLER ON THAT BEACH.

BY THE PUBLIC REACTION
