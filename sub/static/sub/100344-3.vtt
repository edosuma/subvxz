That was what got
the ball rolling.

31:50.631 --> 31:52.547
And, well, by the time
I was eight years old,

31:52.631 --> 31:53.798
I had been tested,

to do that to you?

was Jessa's age,

39:17.339 --> 39:18.923
he used to have
a lot of nightmares.

And Ralph and I,
we discovered that...

39:22.923 --> 39:24.798
just saying,
"Oh, it's a bad dream,"

39:24.881 --> 39:26.839
didn't really help him
very much.

39:26.923 --> 39:29.589
In fact, it usually made him
more agitated.

39:30.964 --> 39:32.047
Your point?

39:33.756 --> 39:35.589
But if we tried to see it
through his eyes,

39:35.673 --> 39:37.923
if we took it as seriously
as he did,

39:38.005 --> 39:40.089
you know,
and asked him details about it

39:40.172 --> 39:42.923
or his thoughts about
what it all meant,

39:43.005 --> 39:46.047
a lot of the times he would
end up convincing himself

39:46.130 --> 39:48.255
that it was just nothing more
than a crappy dream.

39:49.381 --> 39:51.381
Either that,
or he'd end up so bored

39:51.464 --> 39:54.047
by our little debriefing session
that he'd fall back asleep,

39:54.130 --> 39:55.798
just to get us out
of the room.

39:57.798 --> 39:59.339
So, my point...

39:59.422 --> 40:00.798
telling you this is just...

40:02.297 --> 40:04.172
maybe it's not so terrible if...

40:06.297 --> 40:09.839
Can you just let Ralph keep
asking Jessa about her dream?

like daddy but wasn't.

40:43.339 --> 40:44.464
Why didn't you tell me?

40:44.547 --> 40:46.964

start crying again,

40:47.047 --> 40:48.923
and I didn't want you to.

JEANNIE: He looked like
your daddy, but he wasn't?

And he was mean.

40:56.339 --> 40:58.923
He was trying to make me cry.

40:59.005 --> 41:02.589

How about the second time?

41:02.673 --> 41:03.839

41:03.923 --> 41:06.339

like my daddy, but...

messy.

41:09.130 --> 41:11.381

that time?

41:22.589 --> 41:24.214

last night?

No way.

coming back, do you?
