WEBVTT

00:28.500 --> 00:30.250
(Ty)
'My, my, lookee there.'

00:32.417 --> 00:34.500
Hey, Truck.
Wake up, man.

00:34.583 --> 00:36.000
Come on now,
we're here.

00:37.959 --> 00:40.000
We made good time,
didn't we?

00:42.041 --> 00:44.542
Yankees know how to grow 'em.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.375
I won't
repeat that to the missus.

00:46.458 --> 00:48.041
Well, that's a good thing

00:48.125 --> 00:50.375
'cause I'm already
in the woodshed with her.

00:50.458 --> 00:52.458
About had it with you
and the circus life.

00:52.542 --> 00:54.667
Well, that's
being a
musician.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.750
Seems she's had her fill.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.750
Timing's kind of handy
if you think about it.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.000
Why's that?

01:03.083 --> 01:04.500
You'll be seeing Edie tonight.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.667
Edie don't have
the time of day for me.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.125
Ever known a girl didn't have
the time of day for you,
Truck?

01:10.208 --> 01:11.417
He speaks the truth.

01:11.500 --> 01:14.625
Edie Lowe's different.
She's out of my league.

01:14.709 --> 01:16.750
I don't know,
I seen her
looking.

01:16.834 --> 01:18.333
(Ty)
'Here it is.'

01:31.417 --> 01:33.166
My, my.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.166
This here is
where
Johnny Cash

01:35.250 --> 01:37.250
played his first
show
in Philadelphia.

01:37.333 --> 01:38.583
And where Edie
got her start.

01:38.667 --> 01:41.500
Maybe it happens
for us tonight.

01:41.583 --> 01:43.000
Here's hoping, boys.

02:20.250 --> 02:22.792
(woman on radio)
'The battle of the red
and the blue states rages on'

02:22.875 --> 02:25.083
'a week after
the nation went to the
polls.'

02:25.166 --> 02:26.667
'The country
still without a clear'

02:26.750 --> 02:28.208
'winner in Tuesday's election.'

02:28.291 --> 02:31.625
'The results tied up
in the Florida hand recount.'

02:45.000 --> 02:46.625
Who sprang for a tree?

02:46.709 --> 02:48.583
(Stillman)
'Oh, I was with my
daughter when she got hers'

02:48.667 --> 02:52.250
and this one looked
like it...needed a home.

02:53.709 --> 02:55.458
Maybe some water, too.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.208
Crap.
What's Ed Garrett doing here?

03:02.291 --> 03:03.625
(Stillman)
'Your old partner, right?'

03:03.709 --> 03:05.500
Two excruciating years.

03:05.583 --> 03:06.750
What's wrong with him?

03:06.834 --> 03:08.041
Lazy to the bone.

03:09.041 --> 03:10.458
He's coming
right at you, Will.

03:10.542 --> 03:12.083
Oh, great.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.667
Hey, Will.
How's it going?

03:14.750 --> 03:15.959
Hey, Garrett.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.667
You know what this is, folks?

03:17.750 --> 03:18.959
Besides the obvious?

03:19.041 --> 03:21.333
[laughs]
This is a ground ball.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.083
You want to elaborate, Ed?

03:24.166 --> 03:26.333
Six years ago,
I catch a bump in the night.

03:26.417 --> 03:28.500
Cowboy from Tennessee
gets shot in the hood.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.333
Out-of-town victim
always blows.

03:30.417 --> 03:31.834
Junk, right?

03:31.917 --> 03:33.417
I break
myself on it but nothing.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.959
So this
gun turned it around,
huh?

03:35.041 --> 03:37.625
Last week, wife uses it
on her husband, wings him.

03:37.709 --> 03:39.208
(Garrett)
'The serial
number's been filed off'

03:39.291 --> 03:40.500
but ballistics says

03:40.583 --> 03:43.166
this gun
also shot my Tennessee boy.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.208
This lady shooter
have any connect with him?

03:45.291 --> 03:46.709
Mm..

03:46.792 --> 03:49.000
...worked in
the place where he
died.

03:49.083 --> 03:50.792
Case closed, huh?

03:50.875 --> 03:51.875
(Stillman)
'Good break, Ed.'

03:51.959 --> 03:54.125
Yeah, thing is.
John, uh..

03:54.208 --> 03:56.083
...I could use a clearance.

03:56.166 --> 03:58.458
Bosses are really
squeezing me lately.

03:58.542 --> 04:01.625
Meaning we'd
close it and give it to you?

04:01.709 --> 04:03.458
You could do me a solid.

04:03.542 --> 04:06.667
How about we focus on
doing the victim a solid?

04:06.750 --> 04:08.583
Help this cowboy get on home.

04:43.458 --> 04:46.333
So, we're tracking some
out-of-state cowboy's murder?

04:46.417 --> 04:48.542
Country singer
from Tennessee.

04:48.625 --> 04:51.166
- Country?
- You got a problem with
that?

04:51.250 --> 04:54.458
There's really only room for
one country fan in this place.

04:55.917 --> 04:57.834
Well, it's a shocker,
but Garrett didn't do

04:57.917 --> 04:59.250
crap on this job.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.875
Two whole interviews.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.959
One with each
bandmate, older brother Ty

05:03.041 --> 05:05.125
and steel
guitarist, Dusty Ray.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.208
- What's our victim's name?
- Truck Sugar.

05:07.291 --> 05:08.792
Of course it is.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.542
(Stillman)
'Shot in front
of the Blue Star Lounge.'

05:10.625 --> 05:12.542
His band, The Sugar Boys,
played there that night.

05:12.625 --> 05:14.500
(Jeffries)
'Brother found him
the next morning.'

05:14.583 --> 05:16.375
- That's it?
- Pretty much.

05:16.458 --> 05:17.542
Looks like this
cowboy never made it home.

05:17.625 --> 05:18.959
He's buried here in Philly.

05:19.041 --> 05:21.542
Got a line out on that lady
shot her husband?

05:21.625 --> 05:23.375
Rush and Miller are at
Riverside Women's having a
chat.

05:23.458 --> 05:27.250
Maybe she's the answer.
Solve this thing by noon.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.041
Scotty hates country.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.375
That's just wrong.

05:30.458 --> 05:32.375
I'll loan you some CDs.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.583
"She Thinks My
Tractor's
Sexy."

05:34.667 --> 05:37.875
"Tequila Makes Her
Clothes Fall Off."

05:39.208 --> 05:40.834
Can hardly wait.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.333
Clipped your husband
pretty good, huh, Kylie?

05:45.417 --> 05:46.458
He cheated.

05:46.542 --> 05:47.959
Straight up, huh?

05:48.041 --> 05:49.250
You stray, you get a bullet.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.417
That don't sound fair?

05:51.500 --> 05:54.709
Bad luck for you.
Gun you used had a body on it.

05:54.792 --> 05:56.250
Guy who got killed in 2000.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.709
(Rush)
'Truck Sugar.'

05:57.792 --> 05:59.917
'His band played at
the Blue Star where you
worked.'

06:00.000 --> 06:01.583
I remember him.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.291
He was fine.

06:03.375 --> 06:05.500
Remember shooting him?

06:05.583 --> 06:07.500
You know what, girls?

06:07.583 --> 06:08.792
It's your lucky day.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.000
I'm gonna
let you in on something

06:10.083 --> 06:11.834
I've been
sitting on six years.

06:11.917 --> 06:13.083
Bring it on.

06:13.166 --> 06:15.875
This future
ex-husband of mine, Mitch?

06:16.000 --> 06:16.959
He's your man.

06:17.041 --> 06:18.166
How do you know?

06:18.250 --> 06:19.625
The gun was his.

06:19.709 --> 06:22.458
Night this cutie
died, Mitch leaves early.

06:22.542 --> 06:23.917
Says he's going to his wife's.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.375
I thought
you were his wife.

06:25.458 --> 06:27.625
No, I was just
his girlfriend then.

06:27.709 --> 06:31.333
So it's late night, I'm closing.

06:31.417 --> 06:34.291
I hear a shot, and I peek out.

06:34.375 --> 06:36.125
There's your boy, dead.

06:36.208 --> 06:38.500
And right next
to him, Mitch's damn gun.

06:38.583 --> 06:40.208
Mitch have any
reason to ice Truck?

06:40.291 --> 06:42.500
Yeah. He figures
himself for a tough guy.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.083
Someone prove him wrong?

06:44.166 --> 06:48.083
He took those Sugar Boys for
bumpkins he could mess with.

06:48.166 --> 06:49.458
It wasn't that way.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.458
Hey, there!
Truck Sugar.

06:55.542 --> 06:57.625
This here's Dusty.
This is my big brother Ty.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.208
We're The Sugar Boys.

06:59.291 --> 07:01.500
I'm the one that's been
hounding you week in and out.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.500
Yeah, I've been
trying to call you.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.166
We're sure
excited about tonight.

07:05.250 --> 07:08.208
Well...about that, um..

07:08.291 --> 07:09.709
...I put you on
the bill tonight

07:09.792 --> 07:11.000
'cause Edie
recommended you.

07:11.083 --> 07:12.250
We're real grateful.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.542
But...turns out,
this LA band's in town.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.500
- Don't get your meaning.
- They're real hot right now.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.041
Saying we're bumped?

07:19.125 --> 07:22.375
Now hold on now, we just drove
12 hours to get here.

07:22.458 --> 07:23.667
Tough break.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.333
(Dusty)
'And we had a deal.'

07:27.375 --> 07:28.667
You got something on paper?

07:28.750 --> 07:31.750
- Well, I sure don't.
Really--
- So, so, so.

07:31.834 --> 07:33.500
That's the conversation.

07:34.709 --> 07:36.375
That ain't gonna work.

07:36.458 --> 07:38.208
[laughs]
Boys.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.458
Boys, go easy.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.000
Don't make me get my gun.

07:44.375 --> 07:46.250
Look here,
where I come from

07:46.333 --> 07:48.750
a man's word is as good
as a piece of paper.

07:48.834 --> 07:52.250
We ain't where
you're from, hillbilly.

07:52.333 --> 07:53.709
Oh! Oh!

07:53.792 --> 07:56.500
I may seem friendly to you
but I'm actually dangerous

07:56.583 --> 07:58.041
'cause I'm at
the bottom of the heap

07:58.125 --> 07:59.625
ain't got nothing to lose.

07:59.709 --> 08:00.834
Forget it.

08:00.917 --> 08:04.959
- Forget what?
- Forget the LA band.

08:11.250 --> 08:12.583
Let's load in, boys.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.667
(Rush)
'And you think Mitch
retaliated that night?'

08:16.750 --> 08:18.375
Who else would use his gun?

08:18.458 --> 08:22.083
- You...Kylie.
- That Truck was a looker.

08:22.166 --> 08:25.333
I'd never take
out someone fine as him.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.542
Tight alibi.

08:29.417 --> 08:31.041
We may be back.

08:35.208 --> 08:38.542
That crap bitch Kylie!

08:39.667 --> 08:40.667
Kylie being your wife?

08:40.750 --> 08:41.750
Not enough, she shot me.

08:41.834 --> 08:43.333
She's got to
set the law on me, too.

08:43.417 --> 08:45.417
Your gun
killed Truck
Sugar.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.709
And he put your face in
the mud earlier that day.

08:47.792 --> 08:48.750
Kylie told you that, huh?

08:48.834 --> 08:50.625
Yeah. She told us that.

08:52.208 --> 08:54.291
That crazy tomato.

08:54.375 --> 08:58.000
Look...I tried to
push those boys around

08:58.083 --> 08:59.291
but that
Truck pushed back.

08:59.375 --> 09:00.875
Hayseeds could fight.

09:00.959 --> 09:03.458
And maybe late night,
you got some beers in you

09:03.542 --> 09:05.625
found some bravery,
pulled your gun out.

09:05.709 --> 09:07.041
News flash, fellas.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.625
My gun
was swiped that night.

09:09.709 --> 09:12.667
You can DNA me, polygram me.

09:12.750 --> 09:13.959
I did not shoot that cowboy.

09:14.041 --> 09:17.291
- Then who the hell did,
Mitch?
- Maybe Kylie.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.125
She approves of
violence against men.

09:19.208 --> 09:22.375
She points to him,
he points to her. Fun couple.

09:22.458 --> 09:23.500
Got any new thoughts?

09:23.583 --> 09:24.959
Ask me..

09:25.041 --> 09:27.625
..those cowboys brought
their own trouble with
them.

09:27.709 --> 09:29.792
The squirrelly
one,
white cowboy hat.

09:29.875 --> 09:31.875
Dusty.

09:31.959 --> 09:34.333
Disappears during loadin'.

09:34.417 --> 09:35.792
When he turns back up..

09:37.709 --> 09:39.125
...all hell breaks out.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.500
- You got my amp, Truck?
- No.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.333
(Ty)
'Well, it ain't in the
van.'

09:52.417 --> 09:54.834
Well, then where the heck is it?

09:57.917 --> 10:00.000
Ah, shoot. Dusty!

10:00.083 --> 10:01.917
You went and
pawned it, didn't you?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
What? No!

10:03.083 --> 10:04.166
You and that damn habit.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.625
Maybe it got stolen.

10:05.709 --> 10:08.333
Yeah?
Just like my boots in Dallas?

10:08.417 --> 10:10.041
And my bolo in Baton Rouge?

10:10.125 --> 10:13.000
We ain't been here an hour
and you already scored?

10:13.083 --> 10:16.458
This is a big night. Edie's
manager is coming to look at
us.

10:16.542 --> 10:17.583
I know.

10:17.667 --> 10:20.125
Yet you couldn't stay clean
for one night?

10:20.208 --> 10:22.125
That's a true problem.

10:22.208 --> 10:25.000
Thing is, Truck,
I...I got jigsawed.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.709
I...bought a bag of
flour or something.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.041
I ain't sorry to hear it.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.875
- I need some money.
- No.

10:31.959 --> 10:34.375
Come on! You got cash
at that quick-stop there!

10:34.458 --> 10:36.041
No.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.375
Soon as we get
our cut tonight

10:37.458 --> 10:38.875
we're using it
to get the amp back.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.834
Shoot! I was
hoping for a motel room.

10:40.917 --> 10:42.333
Not with this
junkie cleaning us out.

10:42.417 --> 10:43.500
Don't you call me that.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.375
That's what you
are, Dusty, straight up.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.041
You're always such a hardass.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.333
You're not getting
a red dime off of me.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.625
Now, let's rehearse.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.542
Dude skulked
around, all pissed off.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.375
Up to no good.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.542
For sure.

11:07.625 --> 11:11.250
He needs a fix
and Truck cuts him off.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.500
Seen murders happen for less.

11:16.959 --> 11:19.917
So Dusty's stealing from his
bandmates to feed his habit?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Um, he's
jonesing,
needs money.

11:22.083 --> 11:23.959
Truck takes
a hard-line with
him.

11:24.041 --> 11:25.917
And he knows
where that gun is.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.166
Time to talk to the band.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.000
Looks like we're
going to Nashville.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.291
Uh, who's going to Nashville?

11:33.375 --> 11:34.458
Volunteers?

11:36.208 --> 11:39.250
Tennessee...ain't
that a red state?

11:39.333 --> 11:41.750
I try to stay north
of the Mason-Dixon.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.709
I ain't got a belt buckle
big enough for that world.

11:44.792 --> 11:47.166
I've been
down there. I'll...I'll
go.

11:48.417 --> 11:51.792
Draw straws
to see who goes with Lil.

11:51.875 --> 11:55.000
(Stillman)
'Whoever gets the
lucky "T," go home..'

11:56.291 --> 11:57.792
...and pack your boots.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.417
Ain't me.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.750
Or me.

12:06.834 --> 12:08.125
Nope.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.291
Cra..

12:11.375 --> 12:12.458
Road trip.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.041
It'll be fun.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.417
There's a lot of good
country radio down there, boy.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.959
Yee-haw.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.458
Oh...well, hi there.

12:38.542 --> 12:40.959
You must be our
Philadelphia visitors.

12:41.041 --> 12:43.291
Uh, right.
Lilly Rush. Scotty Valens.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.792
Well, I'm Charlene,
and welcome to
Nashville.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.041
Can I get you
a nice cup of
coffee

12:48.125 --> 12:50.250
or some festive eggnog?

12:50.333 --> 12:53.291
Sure, uh, coffee. Thanks.

12:53.375 --> 12:55.709
(Charlene)
'Big Daddy, these are the
detectives from up north.'

12:55.792 --> 12:58.667
Oh. Rush and Valens.
Thanks for having us.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.959
Lieutenant Brown.
They call me Big Daddy.

13:02.041 --> 13:04.458
Okay...Big Daddy.

13:04.542 --> 13:06.917
I started tracking down
your boys from that
band.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.750
Dusty Ray's
from here in
Nashville.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.333
- A session player.
- Great.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.542
But Ty Sugar's
out near
Knoxville.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.375
I got a work address for him.

13:15.291 --> 13:16.542
Well, I'll take a drive.

13:16.625 --> 13:20.166
- I know the way to
Knoxville.
- Oh, you do?

13:20.250 --> 13:21.792
You want to bring Dusty in

13:21.875 --> 13:23.375
Charlene will show
you
our talk room.

13:23.458 --> 13:24.917
(Charlene)
'Oh, sure thing.'

13:25.000 --> 13:26.208
And if y'all have time,
you'll have to come

13:26.291 --> 13:27.834
to The Runaway Pig with us.

13:29.250 --> 13:32.333
It's a barbecue joint.
We like to unwind
there.

13:32.417 --> 13:36.375
Uh, we'll probably be
pretty busy with the case.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.208
Well, suit yourself.

13:39.458 --> 13:40.875
Well, thanks,
Lieutenant Brown.

13:40.959 --> 13:42.500
Oh, you can
call him Big Daddy.

13:49.709 --> 13:52.333
Well, it sounds like
your habit was ruling

13:52.417 --> 13:53.750
your world
back then, Dusty.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.458
I wasted ten
years
on that life.

13:55.542 --> 13:58.417
The night Truck died,
he was trying to keep you
clean.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.583
But a junkie finds a way.

14:00.667 --> 14:04.083
- How'd you score?
- I met a gal, a fiend like
me.

14:04.166 --> 14:05.583
Shacked up
with her and her
drugs.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.000
And who was the girl?

14:07.083 --> 14:10.208
She called herself...Candy
Cane,
or something like that.

14:10.291 --> 14:12.375
Truck have any other
run-ins that night?

14:12.458 --> 14:14.417
Just the
usual.
Him and Ty.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.750
What, the brothers
had throw downs?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.917
I grew up
with those Sugar
Boys

14:19.000 --> 14:21.417
and when they got
on, they got on
great.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.917
When they didn't, they
fought like two cats in a
bag.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.333
(Truck)
'Alright.'

15:07.083 --> 15:08.959
Back of the room,
Miss Out Of Your League.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.959
[chuckles]
Oh, lordy.

15:31.625 --> 15:33.291
Real solid, fellas,
real solid.

15:43.959 --> 15:45.291
She's lookin' again.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.041
(Ty)
Hey, you two,
quit horsing around.

15:48.542 --> 15:50.041
Why don't we close
with that one,
boys?

15:51.792 --> 15:53.667
- You're doing it again,
Truck.
- Well, why not?

15:53.750 --> 15:55.291
Well, it's ten
minutes before the show.

15:55.375 --> 15:56.583
It's no time to
go off the rails.

15:56.667 --> 15:57.583
It's a real good song.

15:57.667 --> 15:58.875
We're gonna
play our usual set

15:58.959 --> 16:00.709
and we're closing
with "Full Deck Of Twos."

16:00.792 --> 16:02.875
- Again?
- Yeah, again!

16:04.667 --> 16:06.583
Look here.

16:06.667 --> 16:09.208
"Full Deck Of Twos"..

16:09.291 --> 16:10.542
...sucks.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.041
- What?
- I'm sorry.

16:14.125 --> 16:17.750
I know you wrote it, and we've
been playing it a long time.

16:17.834 --> 16:19.375
What the heck's
going on around here?

16:19.458 --> 16:21.333
Let's just try my new song.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.500
Oh, you're a big shot now.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.875
You deciding what we do?

16:24.959 --> 16:26.208
I'm just trying
to get us
noticed.

16:26.291 --> 16:27.417
Did you start
this band, Truck?

16:27.500 --> 16:28.875
Have you been
leading this band

16:28.959 --> 16:30.583
for the last
<i>me?</i>

16:30.667 --> 16:31.959
- That's you!
- That's right!

16:32.041 --> 16:34.041
But there's three
of us in the band.

16:35.291 --> 16:37.041
Why don't we take a vote?

16:37.125 --> 16:38.792
Fine.

16:38.875 --> 16:40.000
I vote for my song.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.417
And I vote for mine.

16:48.250 --> 16:51.500
So...whose song did you play?

16:51.583 --> 16:53.000
[chuckles
]
Truck's.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.583
Truth was
he had the talent, not Ty.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.792
And that was the real rub.

16:58.875 --> 17:01.250
Hurts when your baby
brother outdoes you.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.667
What's this I hear
about cops

17:06.750 --> 17:07.834
going to Tennessee
on this case?

17:07.917 --> 17:09.417
Rush and Valens went.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.083
I thought I made myself
clear.
my

17:12.166 --> 17:14.041
How is it your job
if it got passed to us?

17:14.125 --> 17:16.625
This may not have been
the grounder you thought it
was.

17:16.709 --> 17:18.500
We had some leads to
follow up down there.

17:18.583 --> 17:20.250
[laughs]
I could've
gone.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.083
Ed...I couldn't get you

17:22.166 --> 17:23.458
to go to West Philly
for an interview.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.125
Now, you want
to drive to Nashville?

17:25.208 --> 17:27.959
Like I said, the bosses are
breathing down some heavy fire.

17:28.041 --> 17:30.166
Maybe because you work all
day with one eye on the clock.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.542
- I pull my full shift.
- And not a minute longer.

17:33.625 --> 17:36.625
Garrett...I'll
keep you in the
loop.

17:36.709 --> 17:37.834
Appreciate it, John.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.166
Who's the charmer?

17:40.250 --> 17:42.500
Dead weight, the job's
been carrying for years.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.333
Brass is trying to push him
out, but he needs the
benefits.

17:45.417 --> 17:48.417
- His wife.
- She got a problem?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.625
Yeah, she's been in
and out of the puzzle house.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.125
Yeah?

17:53.208 --> 17:55.166
When he runs out of here
at 6:00 on the dot every
night

17:55.250 --> 17:57.208
he's going home
to take care of her.

17:57.291 --> 17:59.959
You want to give him
his clearance, don't you?

18:00.041 --> 18:01.625
I'll leave it up to you.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.667
(Ty)
'Growing up,
Truck and I used to..'

18:15.750 --> 18:18.041
'...listen to the radio
in our mama's kitchen.'

18:18.125 --> 18:20.834
Dream of being
on the airwaves ourselves.

18:20.917 --> 18:24.041
And now you play for
the early bird crowd.

18:24.125 --> 18:26.709
I-I love the music.

18:26.792 --> 18:29.000
I don't mind
who I play it for.

18:29.083 --> 18:32.000
- You and Truck get along
well?
- Sure, always.

18:32.083 --> 18:35.250
- Even the night he died?
- We may have had words.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.917
'Cause I heard your song
got thrown over for
Truck's.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.709
[laughing]
Well, I suppose that's true.

18:39.792 --> 18:43.041
- Well, it must have smarted.
- Well, my pride got scuffed.

18:43.125 --> 18:46.166
But the bigger thing was
the power shift, right?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.208
Before that, you
always called the
shots

18:48.291 --> 18:50.208
'but now, Truck was
going to be the
guy.'

18:50.291 --> 18:54.500
Ma'am...I was sore
about the song.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.000
I'll say that.

18:56.083 --> 18:59.250
But then we played it and damn
if it wasn't a winner.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.291
It get you noticed?

19:01.375 --> 19:02.875
You could say.

19:05.625 --> 19:07.291
(Truck)
'Buy you one.'

19:07.375 --> 19:10.458
[clears throat]
Oh, with your beer
tickets, big
spender.

19:10.542 --> 19:12.917
[laughing]
Oh, come on, Ty,
don't stay mad.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.875
It's on the
house, cutie pie.

19:15.959 --> 19:17.458
- Oh, my.
- What?

19:17.542 --> 19:18.834
Edie's manager's
coming this way.

19:18.917 --> 19:20.750
This could be it,
Truck.
This could..

19:22.208 --> 19:23.417
Hey, well.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.208
- Well, hi, there. Ty Sugar.
- Levon Krace.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.750
That guy Dusty's
with you boys, right?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.083
Yes, sir, he is.

19:29.166 --> 19:30.750
Just tried stealing
one of our guitars.

19:31.417 --> 19:32.458
Oh, lordy.

19:32.542 --> 19:33.834
He was headed
outside with it.

19:33.917 --> 19:35.125
Uh, real sorry.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.375
Must have been a mix-up.

19:36.458 --> 19:38.709
How'd you
like the show, by the way?

19:38.792 --> 19:40.583
It was solid, real solid.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.125
Friggin' Dusty.

19:46.208 --> 19:47.667
(Edie)
'Hey, Philadelphia.'

19:47.750 --> 19:49.166
I'm Edie Lowe.

19:49.250 --> 19:53.000
I wanna thank The Sugar Boys
for opening up tonight.

19:53.083 --> 19:56.291
In fact, they got a song
I want to play for you

19:56.375 --> 20:01.291
but, um only if Truck Sugar
will come up and do it with
me.

20:12.542 --> 20:15.667
Truck here
is a real live cowboy.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.125
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, ma'am.

20:18.208 --> 20:20.375
Well, take it away, cowboy.

23:16.083 --> 23:17.208
Who was the woman?

23:17.291 --> 23:20.792
Uh, that was
Honey Sugar, his missus.

23:20.875 --> 23:23.041
All the way from Tennessee.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.792
(Valens)
'Lucille Sugar?'

23:37.875 --> 23:38.875
I go by Honey.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.458
Philadelphia Homicide.

23:40.542 --> 23:42.625
(Rush)
'It's about your
late husband Truck.'

23:42.709 --> 23:44.500
(Stillman)
'Thanks for coming, Edie.'

23:47.917 --> 23:49.333
You have a Perrier?

23:49.417 --> 23:50.792
Fresh out.

23:50.875 --> 23:53.959
We're looking into
Truck Sugar's death.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.208
I knew Truck.

23:55.291 --> 23:57.166
That's why you're here.

23:57.250 --> 24:00.667
Truck was supposed to
be buried up here on the
farm.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.458
Family plot's
under that old
oak.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.375
We're trying to piece
together
his last night in Philly.

24:06.458 --> 24:09.000
You know the
pop star Edie Lowe?

24:09.083 --> 24:10.709
I see her in magazines.

24:10.792 --> 24:12.625
All glitter eye
shadow
and push-up bras.

24:12.709 --> 24:13.959
That's her.

24:14.041 --> 24:17.417
Gal could sing
before
she went all phony.

24:17.500 --> 24:21.208
Now, she's
just cheap Christmas
trash.

24:21.291 --> 24:22.792
Must have hated
seeing Truck up on

24:22.875 --> 24:25.291
that stage with her then
when you showed up that night?

24:26.917 --> 24:28.709
(Edie)
'Yeah, his wife was there.'

24:28.792 --> 24:31.250
She marched him outside
and her claws were out.

24:31.333 --> 24:32.792
Makes sense, right?
She's the wife.

24:34.208 --> 24:35.875
Possession's
nine-tenths of the law.

24:35.959 --> 24:37.709
You saying you
possessed Truck?

24:40.917 --> 24:42.291
I admit.

24:42.375 --> 24:45.959
I got in my pickup that day
planning to beg him back.

24:46.041 --> 24:47.458
Something change your mind?

24:47.542 --> 24:48.917
Yeah.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.333
The drive.

24:51.417 --> 24:53.792
Nothing like the open
road to make you
realize

24:53.875 --> 24:55.542
what you really
want
is freedom.

24:57.291 --> 24:59.709
So why not turn
around, go on home?

25:01.750 --> 25:03.792
I wanted to see him.

25:03.875 --> 25:05.875
Not to save us.

25:05.959 --> 25:07.041
No?

25:08.875 --> 25:10.250
To say goodbye.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.083
So what's this,
around nine, ten?

25:17.166 --> 25:19.834
Lost track some time ago.

25:23.542 --> 25:25.834
You been my girl for
a long time now,
Honey.

25:27.166 --> 25:28.750
But we both know
something's broken.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.750
And I don't
want us to freeze up.

25:39.083 --> 25:42.583
Things were right
for a good long stretch.

25:42.667 --> 25:44.500
Since the tenth grade.

25:46.875 --> 25:49.834
But I want to be on
the farm with my horses

25:49.917 --> 25:52.333
and you want
to be out here.

25:54.709 --> 25:57.417
Saying you're
done with me, Honey?

25:57.500 --> 26:00.917
We ain't kids,
but we ain't old either.

26:02.375 --> 26:04.333
So if this ain't
the right life..

26:05.375 --> 26:07.500
...I want
to go get another.

26:09.834 --> 26:12.667
Me, too, I guess.

26:15.458 --> 26:16.625
When I write a song..

26:19.166 --> 26:21.625
I always think about
how you'll like it.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.875
So now
you'll write for a new
girl.

26:28.542 --> 26:30.834
I saw her in there, Truck.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.667
- She ain't nothin' like
you.
- She's a Northern gal.

26:39.500 --> 26:42.500
Seems like that's
what you want now.

26:53.375 --> 26:54.834
One last dance.

26:57.709 --> 26:59.375
I sure loved you.

27:00.834 --> 27:02.500
I know.

27:35.375 --> 27:38.083
That's why
I left his body up north.

27:38.166 --> 27:39.500
That's where his heart was.

27:41.041 --> 27:43.709
That was the end of them
and the beginning of us.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.792
Truck actually say that?

27:45.875 --> 27:47.375
Didn't have to.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.458
'Cause she left
and he came right to
me.

28:03.291 --> 28:04.667
Trouble with your wife?

28:05.959 --> 28:09.333
No trouble.
She's heading on home.

28:09.417 --> 28:11.709
You saying you in
the clear, Truck Sugar?

28:11.792 --> 28:13.208
I guess I am.

28:15.291 --> 28:16.458
(Krace)
'Hey!'

28:16.542 --> 28:18.750
- Talk to him?
- Uh, waited for you.

28:20.375 --> 28:22.333
How'd you like
to open for Edie regular?

28:22.417 --> 28:25.208
Yeah, and record
that song, you and me?

28:25.291 --> 28:27.083
(Krace)
'Just have to cut
the one guy loose.'

28:28.208 --> 28:29.583
Bass player.

28:29.667 --> 28:30.792
Bass player?

28:31.834 --> 28:33.792
That's my brother.

28:33.875 --> 28:35.959
- Oh.
- 'Yeah.'

28:36.041 --> 28:37.208
'Ty Sugar.'

28:37.291 --> 28:39.458
You know, The Sugar Boys?

28:39.542 --> 28:41.875
(Krace)
'Look, he
doesn't have the chops.'

28:41.959 --> 28:43.500
Maybe he ain't as
good as Dusty, alright--

28:43.583 --> 28:46.625
Dusty's got it. We want him.

28:46.709 --> 28:47.834
But not Ty?

28:49.792 --> 28:51.125
Think about it.

28:55.709 --> 28:56.959
Ty started the band.

28:57.041 --> 28:57.959
Sure.

28:58.041 --> 29:00.125
He'd be wrecked.

29:00.208 --> 29:01.834
Well, it's tough choices.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.750
I guess it comes down to
who do you want to be.

29:07.458 --> 29:09.917
Truck Sugar who
followed his talent or not.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.917
I guess I got to pick a road.

29:19.375 --> 29:21.291
So which way did he go?

29:21.375 --> 29:23.959
He decided that night
who he wanted to be.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.500
He was comin' with me.

29:27.583 --> 29:29.500
And leaving
his brother in the dust.

29:38.166 --> 29:40.166
Oh, hi, there,
Detective Rush.

29:40.250 --> 29:41.792
Hi, there, Charlene.

29:41.875 --> 29:43.583
We were just, uh..

29:43.667 --> 29:45.583
Oh, I was just pushing off.

29:45.667 --> 29:47.166
So...night now.

29:47.250 --> 29:49.291
Uh, yeah, night.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.667
Oh, you're just cheap
Christmas trash, aren't you?

29:55.750 --> 29:59.583
[scoffs]
Look, Southern people,
they're just so...friendly.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.250
And you didn't want
to come to Tennessee.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.834
Look, Lil, how about
we make a pact here?

30:03.917 --> 30:05.875
What happens in
Nashville stays in Nashville?

30:05.959 --> 30:07.750
Exactly that.

30:07.834 --> 30:11.792
Scotty Valens,
back in the saddle.

30:11.875 --> 30:13.500
I haven't gone out
in, like, a year.

30:13.583 --> 30:14.792
(Rush)
'Mm-hmm.'

30:15.750 --> 30:17.750
- Hey.
- Yeah?

30:19.041 --> 30:20.959
When were you
ever in Knoxville?

30:21.041 --> 30:22.291
When I was 19.

30:23.625 --> 30:26.250
- Almost got hitched there.
- No kidding?

30:26.333 --> 30:28.709
I drove by
the courthouse yesterday

30:28.792 --> 30:30.458
just to see it again.

30:31.834 --> 30:33.417
You know, my theory

30:33.500 --> 30:38.542
about, uh...
getting married?

30:38.625 --> 30:39.583
Yeah?

30:40.917 --> 30:43.667
Just may
not be in the cards for us.

30:43.750 --> 30:45.250
- Why not?
- 'We're cops.'

30:45.333 --> 30:49.917
You know...every good
cop I know is a lone wolf.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Mm.
I've noticed that, too.

30:53.083 --> 30:55.709
- Well, so..
- So..

30:58.458 --> 31:01.959
So maybe all we're going
to have in life
is...Charlenes.

31:02.041 --> 31:06.125
[chuckling]
You know, not
that the Charlenes are so bad.

31:06.208 --> 31:07.500
Uh-huh.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.083
I better get some aspirin.

31:10.166 --> 31:12.375
Oh, the
vending machine has it.

31:12.458 --> 31:14.667
[clears throat]
Anyway.

31:16.417 --> 31:17.709
Night.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.750
Night, Scotty.

31:24.125 --> 31:26.250
Feels like
crap doesn't it, Ty?

31:26.333 --> 31:28.208
Being bad at what
you want to be good at?

31:28.291 --> 31:29.500
I don't follow, ma'am.

31:29.583 --> 31:33.834
Music, you were okay
but not special, like Truck.

31:33.917 --> 31:36.959
I taught that boy
every note he
played.

31:37.041 --> 31:39.500
Must have cut even deeper then
when he made that tough choice.

31:39.583 --> 31:40.917
I don't know what you mean?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.792
People kill
for a handful of reasons.

31:42.875 --> 31:44.917
Love and
money are the top two.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.792
Jealousy's a close third.

31:46.875 --> 31:49.166
[scoffs]
I wasn't jealous of
Truck.

31:49.250 --> 31:51.125
Even when he said
you weren't good enough

31:51.208 --> 31:52.625
and kicked you
out of the band?

31:52.709 --> 31:55.208
[clears throat]
He...didn't do
that.

31:55.291 --> 31:57.792
The boys up north
have been talking to Edie
Lowe.

31:57.875 --> 32:00.417
Truck bounced
you, Ty, that night.

32:00.500 --> 32:01.875
Some things are
personal,
okay?

32:01.959 --> 32:03.792
Not okay.

32:03.875 --> 32:06.250
We're gonna start
this interview over.

32:06.333 --> 32:07.542
You alright with
that, little sister?

32:07.625 --> 32:09.500
I'm alright
with that, Big Daddy.

32:09.583 --> 32:12.750
(Lt. Brown)
'You start talking about
how that conversation went'

32:12.834 --> 32:16.250
when your baby brother
gave you the shove-off.

32:16.333 --> 32:18.750
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am.

32:27.875 --> 32:30.375
(Ty)
'Shoot. Dusty!'

32:30.458 --> 32:33.000
There's nothing
left in here to take!

32:36.333 --> 32:37.917
It's Truck.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.083
You want
to sleep in here, Truck?

32:39.166 --> 32:41.000
You want
me to move on over?

32:41.083 --> 32:43.208
Nah, I just want
to talk to you a
bit.

32:43.291 --> 32:44.834
Well, have a seat.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.041
It's pretty rough, Ty.

32:54.125 --> 32:55.375
Okay.

32:55.458 --> 32:56.875
See..

32:56.959 --> 32:59.875
...well, that manager
took
an interest in my song.

32:59.959 --> 33:03.375
Well, I'm not surprised.

33:04.625 --> 33:06.125
And he wants us to record it.

33:07.458 --> 33:08.875
Well, my, my.

33:10.375 --> 33:11.625
But there's a hitch.

33:18.917 --> 33:21.500
[sighs]
I know, Truck.

33:23.333 --> 33:25.250
I know what
you're going to say.

33:25.333 --> 33:29.041
- You do?
- And it's okay.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.291
I saw this day coming.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.792
I didn't.

33:33.875 --> 33:37.542
Look here.
I'll always have music.

33:37.625 --> 33:40.458
I mean, it doesn't matter
if I'm playing at a beer
joint

33:40.542 --> 33:43.792
or the Grand Ole Opry,
I will play.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.834
'Cause I love it.

33:48.667 --> 33:50.333
But I don't got
to hold you back.

33:51.583 --> 33:53.083
What about The Sugar Boys?

33:53.166 --> 33:56.458
That'll be
where you started.

34:00.667 --> 34:02.750
Are you sure, Ty?

34:02.834 --> 34:04.250
You sure it's okay?

34:05.875 --> 34:08.625
You just remember
where you come from.

34:08.709 --> 34:12.250
Remember that music
in mama's kitchen, right?

34:12.333 --> 34:14.750
Right.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.458
I'm gonna drive on
home tomorrow, okay?

34:23.417 --> 34:25.625
And I'll just..

34:25.709 --> 34:28.125
I'll see you
when I see you.

34:30.667 --> 34:32.583
Thanks, Ty.

34:39.333 --> 34:41.625
Hey...hey, Truck.

34:44.792 --> 34:47.458
I'll be rooting for you.

35:03.291 --> 35:05.375
Someone's got
a chance to rise up

35:05.458 --> 35:08.333
you...got to get
out of the way.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.000
Where's Dusty all this time?

35:10.083 --> 35:12.500
Last I saw, he was
headed to a pawnshop.

35:12.583 --> 35:13.667
What was he pawning?

35:13.750 --> 35:16.083
Anything
to get his drug
money.

35:16.166 --> 35:17.625
I thought he went home
with a girl for that.

35:17.709 --> 35:20.166
Someone named...Candy Cane?

35:20.250 --> 35:22.041
Candy Cane ain't a girl.

35:22.125 --> 35:23.792
That's what he
called his
heroin.

35:23.875 --> 35:27.250
(Ty)
'Every city we'd play in,
'he'd go out to find'

35:27.333 --> 35:29.166
Candy Cane.

35:31.750 --> 35:33.917
So Dusty's alibi is blown out.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.208
His one-night stand
didn't exist.

35:35.291 --> 35:36.542
Called the pawnshop.

35:36.625 --> 35:37.875
Guy remembered
him bringing in that amp.

35:37.959 --> 35:39.208
And even better,
confirms he came back

35:39.291 --> 35:40.709
late at night,
offering up a gun.

35:40.792 --> 35:43.333
- What kind of gun?
- Kind of gun can't be pawned.

35:43.417 --> 35:45.208
'Cause the serial
number was filed
off.

35:45.291 --> 35:47.291
- That's our weapon.
- Guy turned him away.

35:47.375 --> 35:49.834
Dusty's desperate.
No money, no drugs.

35:49.917 --> 35:51.959
Just the gun that
killed our cowboy.

35:52.041 --> 35:53.667
Junk will sink
you every time.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.500
Let's call the posse.

35:57.041 --> 36:00.709
Now, we got to talk about
Candy Cane again.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.375
I told you
I only knew her the one
night.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.709
No, you wasted
ten years with her.

36:04.792 --> 36:06.375
(Rush)
'There was
no Candy Cane.'

36:06.458 --> 36:09.291
No room for girls in your
love affair with heroin,
right?

36:10.709 --> 36:11.959
I already said
I was an
addict.

36:12.041 --> 36:13.750
Stealing to feed your habit.

36:13.834 --> 36:16.041
But you couldn't get your
hands
on any more amps or guitars

36:16.125 --> 36:17.291
that night, could you?

36:17.375 --> 36:18.917
But there
was that gun at the bar.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.041
I never saw that gun.

36:20.125 --> 36:21.375
And no sale
at the pawnshop though.

36:21.458 --> 36:22.917
I don't know
what
you're saying.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.917
The guy who worked
there ID'd you, Dusty.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.625
Must have mixed me up
with somebody else.

36:26.709 --> 36:28.250
How many guys you figure
are in North Philly

36:28.333 --> 36:31.083
at 2:00 a.m. wearing
a white cowboy hat?

36:33.166 --> 36:34.834
You went back to Truck.

36:36.834 --> 36:39.959
You were gonna get some
money...no matter what.

36:41.834 --> 36:44.000
He was always
such a
hardass.

36:45.667 --> 36:48.208
Denied you
right up to the end.

36:48.291 --> 36:50.041
He was just
tryin' to save
me.

36:52.041 --> 36:55.041
All I could see was
someone in my way.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.458
You talk to your brother?

37:25.542 --> 37:27.625
Yeah.

37:27.709 --> 37:28.834
We're square.

37:31.166 --> 37:35.291
- So?
- So...I'm goin' home.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.375
You wanna..

37:42.166 --> 37:43.750
Lead on.

37:43.834 --> 37:45.125
(Dusty)
'Hey.'

37:45.208 --> 37:47.250
Hey. You heard?

37:47.333 --> 37:48.542
Three of us
are
hitting the
road.

37:50.250 --> 37:52.959
You're saying
no more sleeping in that van

37:53.041 --> 37:54.750
scraping around for cash?

37:54.834 --> 37:55.792
No more.

37:55.875 --> 37:59.542
[chuckles]
Well, that's
good.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.667
Real good, just..
That's just about washed me up.

38:02.750 --> 38:04.458
Levon's got
lots of good ideas.

38:04.542 --> 38:06.333
I know you boys are
gonna clean up good.

38:08.125 --> 38:10.083
Darlin', this is cleaned up.

38:10.166 --> 38:13.875
Well, he thinks you might
need a touch more city in ya.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.959
Might have to lose
that hat once and for all.

38:17.041 --> 38:18.291
Lose it?

38:18.375 --> 38:21.625
Yeah, and maybe
the steel guitar

38:21.709 --> 38:23.583
'fiddle.'

38:23.667 --> 38:25.083
Why?

38:25.166 --> 38:27.542
Get a little closer
to pop than country.

38:27.625 --> 38:29.250
Sure.
Sure, we can do that.

38:29.333 --> 38:30.709
(Edie)
'Yeah.'

38:32.875 --> 38:34.250
We're boys who
grew up with country.

38:35.542 --> 38:37.875
It's what our songs
are, that's our story.

38:37.959 --> 38:40.166
It's just packaging.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.458
It's how you make it.

38:44.208 --> 38:47.083
Shoot, Truck.
This is our
chance.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.083
You know,
you were right, Edie.

38:53.959 --> 38:55.792
It comes down
to who do you want to be.

38:57.166 --> 38:59.417
And I want to be Truck Sugar
from East Tennessee.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.000
Lordy.

39:01.083 --> 39:04.375
Brother to Ty, who started our
little band, The Sugar Boys

39:04.458 --> 39:06.875
because we love the music
we heard in our mama's kitchen.

39:06.959 --> 39:08.959
We ain't blowin' this, Truck.

39:09.041 --> 39:11.041
And husband to Honey.

39:15.083 --> 39:16.583
If she'll have me back.

39:20.500 --> 39:22.875
You're a real
live cowboy, aren't you?

39:24.000 --> 39:25.709
Yes, ma'am.

39:27.125 --> 39:29.333
This is crazy.

39:29.417 --> 39:31.250
This is what
we've been waitin' for.

39:32.834 --> 39:34.333
This ain't the way, Dusty.

39:34.417 --> 39:37.041
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
- Whoa, hey, whoa.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.125
Don't be a fool.

39:38.208 --> 39:39.792
You listen to me.

39:39.875 --> 39:43.500
You're gonna
give me some cash right now

39:43.583 --> 39:46.041
and-and we're going
to say yes to this deal.

39:46.125 --> 39:47.375
This ain't you, Dusty.

39:47.458 --> 39:49.333
Give me some
bills, Truck, I mean it.

39:49.417 --> 39:51.792
You've lost
your way in that junk.

39:52.917 --> 39:54.542
We'll be free and clear.

39:54.625 --> 39:56.125
I'm gonna help you, Dusty.

39:56.208 --> 39:58.291
We're both going
to find our way back.

39:59.166 --> 40:00.500
Out of my way.

40:00.583 --> 40:02.667
No chance, cowboy,
we're going home.

40:14.500 --> 40:17.125
Truck. Truck, Truck.
Truck, Truck.

40:21.458 --> 40:24.208
I wasn't part of this.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.500
I wasn't here.
