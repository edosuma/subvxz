AND IT WOULD HELP PEOPLE

08:21.468 --> 08:22.951
THAT HAD TRANSGENDER KIDS."

08:22.970 --> 08:25.720
LITTLE DID WE KNOW
THAT IT WOULD END UP BEING

08:25.756 --> 08:27.556
THIS, LIKE, HISTORICAL MOMENT

08:27.591 --> 08:29.558
WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN
THE FLOOD GATES

08:29.593 --> 08:31.259
OPENED UP
AND TRANSGENDER CHILDREN

08:31.294 --> 08:32.561
STARTED COMING OUT
OF THE WOODWORKS.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.230
IT WAS LIKE THE BEGINNING
OF A GENERATION

08:35.265 --> 08:36.648
OF TRANSGENDER YOUTH.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.100
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S AT ABC
WHERE WE STARTED,

08:39.135 --> 08:41.520
SO IT MAKES SENSE FOR US
TO BE DOING IT

08:41.572 --> 08:43.972
NOW THAT JAZZ IS
COMPLETING HER JOURNEY.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.808
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

Sander: WHATCHA DOING?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.203
JUST READING THE PAPER.

08:58.255 --> 08:59.704
SEE ANYTHING ABOUT JAZZ
IN THE NEWS?

08:59.756 --> 09:01.039
SHOULD I?

09:01.091 --> 09:02.841
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF YOU DO SOON.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.292
WHY IS THAT?

09:04.327 --> 09:05.510
BECAUSE HER YouTube VIDEOS
THAT WE STARTED POSTING

09:05.546 --> 09:06.761
ARE DOING
REALLY, REALLY WELL.

09:06.797 --> 09:09.431
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE GONNA
LET ME OR MOM

09:09.466 --> 09:12.867
SEE 'EM BEFORE
YOU POSTED THE STUFF.

09:12.903 --> 09:14.853
SANDER SAYS YOU GUYS
POSTED VIDEOS ON YouTube

09:14.888 --> 09:16.821
WITHOUT ME OR MOM
SEEING THEM.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.790
YEAH.
IS THAT OKAY?

09:18.825 --> 09:22.627
IT'S DIFFICULT TO MANAGE JAZZ
AND THE KIDS' SOCIAL MEDIA.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.963
THINGS THAT THEY SHARE PUBLICLY

09:24.998 --> 09:26.998
SOMETIMES GET PICKED UP
BY MEDIA OUTLETS,

09:27.034 --> 09:29.568
AND THAT MEANS MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

09:29.603 --> 09:31.870
ARE GONNA KNOW
THE INFORMATION THEY'RE SHARING.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.605
I HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.907

BREAK INTO THE HOSPITAL

HAVE SAID JUNE 26th,

BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING
TO FREAK OUT ABOUT.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.874
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
WE NEED TO SUPPLY THEM

10:25.909 --> 10:27.142
WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

10:27.177 --> 10:29.511
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN A PUBLIC SPACE,

10:29.546 --> 10:31.313
MY CONCERN IS TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE SAFE,

10:31.348 --> 10:35.550
AND THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY
A POLARIZING TOPIC TO PEOPLE.

10:35.585 --> 10:38.186
THERE'S PEOPLE THAT
SHOW HATRED TOWARDS YOU.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.922
I DO NOT THINK
YOU SHOULD MAKE...

10:45.929 --> 10:47.228
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO SERIOUS?

10:47.264 --> 10:49.230
WE POSTED A YouTube VIDEO
ABOUT THE SURGERY,

10:49.266 --> 10:52.300
AND THEN I MENTIONED
THE DATE, JUNE 26th.

10:52.336 --> 10:54.936
I THINK DAD IS A LITTLE
OVERREACTING.

10:54.971 --> 10:57.839
THE INTERNET IS ALWAYS
A DANGEROUS PLACE,

10:57.874 --> 10:59.941
ESPECIALLY FOR
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.727
JAZZ HAS HAD AN ONLINE PRESENCE
FOR A VERY LONG TIME,

11:02.746 --> 11:06.648
AND MOST OF THE COMMENTS THAT
JAZZ GETS ARE VERY POSITIVE.

11:06.683 --> 11:08.717
ON THE OTHER HAND,
THERE'S THE HATERS

11:08.752 --> 11:11.036
THAT WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.287
"SOMEONE PLEASE SHOOT IT.

11:12.322 --> 11:14.055
IF NOT, I'M GOING
TO KILL IT MYSELF

11:14.091 --> 11:16.591
AND MAKE IT DIE
A HORRIBLE, PAINFUL DEATH."

11:16.626 --> 11:18.326
WHAT THE HELL?

11:26.370 --> 11:28.937
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT SHE HAS
TO PROTECT HERSELF

11:28.972 --> 11:31.740
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE
THAT DON'T LIKE HER.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.908
I JUST DON'T WORRY ABOUT
ANYTHING, LIKE,

11:33.944 --> 11:35.677
MY SECURITY OR SAFETY.

11:35.712 --> 11:38.446
WELL, YOU NEED TO THINK
SOMETIMES BEFORE YOU ACT.

11:38.482 --> 11:40.582
-DAD, HOW WORRIED ARE YOU?
-I MEAN...

11:40.617 --> 11:43.718
-DO WE NEED SECURITY?
-WE MAY HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT.

11:43.754 --> 11:46.554
THE ONE OR TWO PEOPLE
THAT ARE SO FAR OFF

11:46.590 --> 11:48.423
THE DEEP END,
THAT IT JUST SCARES ME.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.825
THOSE KIND OF PEOPLE
THAT ARE JUST NOT

11:50.861 --> 11:53.128
WITHIN THE REALM
OF COMPREHENSION,

11:53.163 --> 11:54.329
THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.

11:54.364 --> 11:56.731
IT ONLY TAKES ONE PERSON.

11:56.767 --> 11:59.751
NOW PEOPLE COULD TRACK US DOWN
ON A CERTAIN DATE

11:59.786 --> 12:01.686
AT A CERTAIN TIME
AT A CERTAIN PLACE.

12:01.722 --> 12:05.607
NOW WE HAVE A SECURITY ISSUE.
-Jazz: I'M SORRY.

12:05.642 --> 12:09.511
I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND MY DAD'S
CONCERN AND FEEL BAD

12:09.563 --> 12:11.179
BECAUSE THERE'S
DEFINITELY TOO MUCH

12:11.231 --> 12:13.348
THAT YOU COULD SHARE
IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.466
I THINK SANDER AND I
LEARNED OUR LESSON AND KNOW

12:15.485 --> 12:17.769
THAT WE HAVE TO BE
MORE CAREFUL IN THE FUTURE.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.320
IT'S WONDERFUL
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

12:19.356 --> 12:21.305
YOU WANT TO SHARE
YOUR STORY,

12:21.324 --> 12:23.158
BUT THE TYPE OF MEDIA
THAT PICKS UP ON THIS

12:23.193 --> 12:25.443
LIKE TO SENSATIONALIZE,
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

12:25.478 --> 12:28.246
I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH ABC.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.614
THERE'S A REPORTER --

12:29.649 --> 12:30.782
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW
WHO JUJU CHANG IS.

12:30.817 --> 12:31.933
SHE WORKS ON "NIGHTLINE."

12:31.968 --> 12:33.601
SHE'S INTERESTED IN HAVING
A SIT-DOWN

12:33.637 --> 12:36.037
WITH YOU ONE-ON-ONE
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR SURGERY,

12:36.072 --> 12:38.440
LIKE, YOUR FINAL INTERVIEW
BEFORE YOU GO

12:38.475 --> 12:40.809
AND HAVE
YOUR BOTTOM SURGERY.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.677
DO I HAVE TO DO IT OR...

12:42.712 --> 12:44.679
IT'S JUST, LIKE, A CONTINUATION
OF YOUR STORY.

12:44.714 --> 12:46.080
YOU'RE GOING FULL CIRCLE.

12:46.116 --> 12:47.632
HOW CLOSE TO THE SURGERY?

12:47.667 --> 12:50.334
WE HAVE PRE-OP MEETING CONSULT
ON MONDAY.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.836
IT WOULD BE BEFORE MONDAY.
IT'S NOT A LOT OF TIME.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.388
NO.
UN-UH.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.640
SOMETIMES MY MOM BOOKS
EVENTS FIRST

12:55.675 --> 12:58.226
AND THEN SHE TELLS ME ABOUT IT,
WHICH IS KIND OF ANNOYING

12:58.278 --> 12:59.894
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE
HOW I FEEL ABOUT

12:59.946 --> 13:03.181
DOING A SERIOUS INTERVIEW
3 DAYS BEFORE MY SURGERY.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.783
IT MIGHT BE STRESSFUL TO HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING

13:04.818 --> 13:06.818
LIKE THAT, LIKE,
RIGHT BEFORE THE SURGERY.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.953
"NIGHTLINE" IS A LITTLE INTENSE.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.855
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS TONE.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.624
ABC HAS ALWAYS BEEN
REALLY GOOD.

13:12.659 --> 13:13.825
THEY DON'T GRILL YOU.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.359
SO THIS IS MORE OF A HUMAN
INTEREST STORY

13:15.378 --> 13:16.878
WHERE THEY'RE JUST
GONNA TALK TO JAZZ

13:16.913 --> 13:18.163
AND LET HER EXPLAIN
WHAT'S GOING ON.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.363
WELL, IT'S A CONTINUATION.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.748
LIKE, WE'VE FOLLOWED
YOUR JOURNEY.

13:20.801 --> 13:23.034
YOU'RE USUALLY OKAY WITH THINGS
THAT ARE LOW-KEY

13:23.053 --> 13:24.669
IN A STUDIO ONE-ON-ONE.

13:24.704 --> 13:27.005
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU DO INTERVIEWS
IT'S LOW-KEY AND CONVERSATIONAL.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.057
OTHER TIMES IT'S MORE, LIKE,
INTENSE AND...

13:29.092 --> 13:32.794
NO.
IT'S JUST, LIKE, A FLUFF PIECE.

13:32.829 --> 13:35.046
OKAY.
I'LL DO THE INTERVIEW.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.765
I'M JUST HOPING THAT IT'S GOING
TO BE A LIGHTHEARTED PIECE

13:37.801 --> 13:41.603
WHERE I JUST TALK AUTHENTICALLY
ABOUT MY LIFE AND STORY.

13:41.655 --> 13:45.023
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TOO
STRESSFUL OR TOO OVERBEARING,

13:45.058 --> 13:47.642
SO I'M JUST TRUSTING MY MOM.

IT'S ANOTHER ONE OF MY BARGAINS.

14:07.681 --> 14:08.963
YOU COULDN'T TELL THERE
WERE HOLES IN THEM

14:09.015 --> 14:10.215
WHEN THEY WERE IN A BALL.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.415

PARTY.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.903

I'M GONNA BAKE A CAKE...

14:31.938 --> 14:34.272
- LAUGHS ] STOP. OH!
-LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.273
SHOULD WE MAKE THE PENIS
THIS BIG? LIKE...

14:35.292 --> 14:36.741
YOU'RE KIDDING.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.126
-YEAH.
-IN LIVING COLOR?

14:38.161 --> 14:41.579
WE CAN'T MAKE IT LOOK
REALLY PENIS PENIS-Y...ISH.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.298
I GOTTA KEEP IT G-RATED
FOR GREG, AND HE SAID,

14:43.333 --> 14:46.000
"HOW DO YOU KEEP A PENIS
G-RATED?" I DON'T KNOW.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.119
OH, JEANETTE.
THIS IS HYSTERICAL.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.922
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT OF
HAVING FAREWELL TO THE PENIS

14:50.957 --> 14:52.790
BECAUSE COMING FROM THE ERA
THAT I DO,

14:52.809 --> 14:55.459
THESE ARE THE DIRTY LITTLE
THINGS THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT.

14:55.478 --> 14:59.731
AND HERE WE ARE NOW. IT'S BECOME
WATER OFF A DUCK'S BACK.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.399
YOU KNOW, IT TAKES IT
FULL CIRCLE

15:01.434 --> 15:04.852
TO WHEN SHE WAS
SUCH A LITTLE ONE AND SAID,

15:04.905 --> 15:07.605
"MOMMY, WHEN IS THE FAIRY
GONNA COME ALONG

15:07.640 --> 15:10.491
AND GET RID OF MY PENIS
AND I CAN HAVE A 'GINA?"

15:10.527 --> 15:12.827
AND HERE WE ARE. YOU'RE
BRINGING HOME HER DREAM.

15:12.862 --> 15:14.362
YEAH.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.332
MY MOM HAS BEEN ON THIS JOURNEY
WITH US FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

15:17.367 --> 15:20.702
SHE REALLY DIDN'T FIGHT IT.
SHE DIDN'T QUESTION IT.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.871
SHE WATCHED, AND SHE LEARNED,
AND SHE SUPPORTED,

15:23.924 --> 15:26.925
AND IT'S WONDERFUL
TO SEE HER EVOLUTION.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.927
I WANT TO FILL YOU IN
A LITTLE BIT

15:28.962 --> 15:31.879
ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN DAD
AND MY WORLD.

15:31.932 --> 15:32.997
YEAH.

15:33.016 --> 15:36.017
DAD WENT UNDER
A CARDIAC ABLATION.

15:36.052 --> 15:37.518
RIGHT.

15:37.554 --> 15:40.221
THERE WAS AN EXTRA WHAT THEY
CALL FLUTTER, EXTRA HEARTBEAT.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.007
-YEAH.
-THE ABLATION PROCEDURE,

15:43.026 --> 15:46.778
THAT GIZMO BURNS OUT THE AREA
THAT'S OVERDOING.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.112
AND THEY DID THAT.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.698
AND THEY DID IT,
BUT WITHIN A FEW SHORT DAYS,

15:50.734 --> 15:54.652
THE FLUTTER WAS BACK AGAIN.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.738
IS HE IN PAIN?

15:56.790 --> 15:58.906
HE'S GETTING A LITTLE MORE
IN DISCOMFORT.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.960
DAD AND I ARE
IN OUR GOLDEN YEARS.

16:01.995 --> 16:05.296
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LIVING
FOR ANOTHER 20, 30.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.132
LET'S JUST GO DAY BY DAY.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.802
I THINK JEANETTE HAS DENIAL
ABOUT THE AGING PROCESS,

16:10.837 --> 16:13.054
BUT YOU GOTTA HAVE
SOME REALISM IN LIFE.

16:13.089 --> 16:14.222
PARENTS DO GET OLDER.

16:14.257 --> 16:16.724
THEY DO GET SICK,
AND THEY GO ON.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.426
Jeanette:
WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE KID,

16:18.478 --> 16:19.811
YOU LOOK AT YOUR PARENTS LIKE,

16:19.846 --> 16:21.379
"THEY'RE GOING
TO LIVE FOREVER."

16:21.398 --> 16:22.680
THEY'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.765
THEY'RE YOUR PARENTS.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.716
MY DAD IS 82,
BUT I LOOK AT THEM,

16:25.735 --> 16:27.652
AND THEY'RE<i> YOUNG</i> OLDER PEOPLE.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.270
I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.554
YOU'RE STAYING WITH ME.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.907
I CAN'T DO THIS WORLD
WITHOUT YOU GUYS.

16:32.942 --> 16:36.527
