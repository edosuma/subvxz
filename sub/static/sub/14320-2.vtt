00:28.291 --> 00:33.583
Perhaps what we need is
a human with a set of
adamantium claws.

00:34.583 --> 00:36.958
Leech got message

00:36.958 --> 00:38.250

00:45.875 --> 00:46.958
Watch out!

00:49.375 --> 00:51.583
Now, where is Yuriko?

00:51.583 --> 00:55.125
Here, Logan, or
don't you recognize me?

00:55.125 --> 00:56.708
Yuriko?

00:56.708 --> 01:00.125
The Yuriko
you knew no
longer exists.

sound friendly.

I ain't waiting
to find out.

-GAMBIT: What is it?

03:13.833 --> 03:17.458

Nothing you can do

Come on, kid, talk to me.

Just hang in there, okay?
For me.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.833
Have a good look, Yuriko.

05:02.833 --> 05:05.250
Here's your revenge.
Are you happy now?

05:05.250 --> 05:08.500
You are the one
who destroyed
my father.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.500
This is on your head!

05:10.500 --> 05:12.875
Gambit don't care
whose fault this is.

from his drop cloths.

05:30.958 --> 05:33.708
But Picasso
holds a peculiar
fascination for me.

05:33.708 --> 05:37.750
There's something so primal,
so organic in his work.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.708

an eloquence

06:23.583 --> 06:25.416

06:25.416 --> 06:26.875
They knew the risks.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.875

06:28.875 --> 06:30.708
What have they done

That writing! I knew it!

14:39.250 --> 14:41.583
It was a warning
about the creature.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.291
Hurry and help
the others, Hank.

14:43.291 --> 14:44.708
I must learn more.

14:49.208 --> 14:50.458
What happened?

14:52.875 --> 14:53.875
Professor?

15:02.750 --> 15:05.458
GAMBIT:
You sure that monster
come this way, Wolverine?

15:05.458 --> 15:06.875
Believe me, Cajun.

15:06.875 --> 15:07.958
(SNIFFING)

15:07.958 --> 15:09.000
I can smell it.

15:11.708 --> 15:15.166
What, Professor?
Yes, I understand.

15:15.166 --> 15:16.833
I'll warn
the others
immediately.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.333
Guys, I've got news.

15:19.333 --> 15:22.333
That spacecraft was
an alien prison ship

15:22.333 --> 15:25.291
designed to hold this
energy-absorbing creature,

15:25.291 --> 15:28.708
called a Spirit Drinker,
captive in deep space
forever.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.458
GAMBIT:
So then what
it doing here?

15:34.458 --> 15:38.166
JEAN: Who knows? Maybe
it was knocked off course.

15:38.166 --> 15:39.708
How did
the Professor
learn all this?

15:39.708 --> 15:42.458
That's the odd thing.
He doesn't know.

15:42.458 --> 15:44.166
(DISTANT ROARING)

15:44.166 --> 15:46.000
It's moving
toward the surface.

15:49.166 --> 15:51.083
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

15:58.250 --> 15:59.708
(ROARING)

16:10.458 --> 16:13.375
-CYCLOPS: Look, there it is!
-GAMBIT: But how we stop it?

16:15.166 --> 16:17.875
Blasters
don't affect it,
rocks don't crush it,

16:17.875 --> 16:19.500
and Jubilee's inside.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.291
Well, whatever we do,
we'd better do it quickly.

16:22.291 --> 16:25.166
I sense that
the captive spirits
inside the creature

16:25.166 --> 16:27.125
have begun
to grow weaker.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.375
If we don't find
a way to free
them soon,

16:29.375 --> 16:31.750
I'm afraid it
may be too late.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.291
GAMBIT:
How we gonna
beat this thing

16:33.291 --> 16:34.958
when we can't
even get close to it?

16:36.166 --> 16:37.875
That's the answer!

16:37.875 --> 16:40.083
Wolverine, don't!

16:40.083 --> 16:42.750
Look, Cyke.
My claws hurt this thing.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.833
So did Yuriko's.

16:44.833 --> 16:47.208
Keep those things off of me
and I think I got a chance.

16:47.208 --> 16:48.750
What about Jubilee?

16:48.750 --> 16:51.000
We've got to chance it.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.750
If we don't get her back now,
there may not be anything
left to save.

16:54.750 --> 16:58.875
Okay, bub.
Suppertime's over.

16:58.875 --> 17:01.708
Okay, everybody. Get ready.

17:01.708 --> 17:03.958
You want to
absorb something?

17:03.958 --> 17:05.375
(WOLVERINE YELLING)

17:09.166 --> 17:10.833
Suck on this!

17:10.833 --> 17:12.583
(WOLVERINE BELLOWING)

17:23.958 --> 17:27.125
Wolverine! No!

17:30.291 --> 17:34.333
You will never
succeed, Logan.

17:35.416 --> 17:37.166
We are all doomed.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.958
(ROARING)

17:38.958 --> 17:41.583
(GRUNTING)

17:41.583 --> 17:45.000
You don't
know me very well,

17:46.250 --> 17:47.375
do you?

17:50.458 --> 17:52.000
Wolverine, look out!

17:55.125 --> 17:56.333
(SCREAMING)

17:58.958 --> 18:00.000
Logan!

18:04.458 --> 18:08.500
CYCLOPS: Careful, people,
stay out of reach of its
tendrils.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.958
Beast, get Wolverine!

18:10.958 --> 18:12.750
-Consider it done.
-We'll hold it off!

18:20.500 --> 18:22.000
Over there.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.708
Do not try to move,
my friend.

18:23.708 --> 18:26.583
No, look, a chunk of
it hit the third rail.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.458
I understand.

18:31.750 --> 18:32.833
That's the answer.

18:48.708 --> 18:54.166
(POWER SURGING)

19:09.958 --> 19:11.291
I don't believe it.

19:11.291 --> 19:12.500
What about Jubilee?

19:12.500 --> 19:14.000
JUBILEE:
What do you think?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.333
Hey, kid.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.708
Congratulations, Wolverine.

19:17.708 --> 19:20.166
I was so worried about you!

19:20.166 --> 19:23.000
We seem to be short
one Spirit Drinker.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.416
Yeah.
Bad case of overeating.

19:25.416 --> 19:28.166
So, where does
that leave us,
Yuriko?

19:29.291 --> 19:30.708
Still planning my funeral?

19:30.708 --> 19:33.625
Today I owe you
my life, Logan.

19:33.625 --> 19:36.583
But that changes
nothing between us.

19:36.583 --> 19:40.833
When I am strong enough,
you will see me again.

19:49.375 --> 19:50.416
Yuriko.

19:57.458 --> 20:00.166
All the Morlocks are
back to normal, Professor.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.375
The Reavers escaped,

20:02.375 --> 20:05.000
but I bet it'll be a while
before they can repair
their cybernetics.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.875
I am deeply
thankful you're
all safe, my X-Men.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.875
Then it's all over, right?

20:10.875 --> 20:13.416
I only wish that
were true, child.

20:13.416 --> 20:16.291
But when I touched
that alien craft,

20:18.291 --> 20:23.208
I felt things, sensed things,
I have never known before,

20:24.250 --> 20:30.291
saw terrible visions of
beings with ruthless
unimaginable power.

20:30.291 --> 20:33.625
But I fear this was
only the beginning.
