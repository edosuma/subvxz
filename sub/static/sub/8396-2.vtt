00:06.520 --> 00:07.879
You're gonna fall, Henry.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.079
Please.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.159
Please!

00:16.120 --> 00:18.679
Alice Morgan is a malignant narcissist.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.439
This is about prestige,
power, self-affirmation.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.599
She killed her parents.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.559
No forensics, no witnesses.

00:25.640 --> 00:26.719
Send her home!

00:29.040 --> 00:30.039
I still love you, Zoe.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.119
You care more about
the dead than the living.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.839
That's where your heart is.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.479
Do you love him?

00:41.280 --> 00:42.479
I didn't ask you for it, did I?

00:51.400 --> 00:53.399
- Hello, John.
- Alice.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.799
You may be very, very clever.

00:55.880 --> 00:56.919
But you're wrong.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.279
There is love in the world.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.479
So you lose.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.799
Lima Sierra 219 to Control.
Confirm, we do have a white male down.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.279
Mid 20s, possible gunshot wounds, over.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.279
Received, Lima Sierra 219.

As you know, DCI Luther
is facing a charge of assault

03:10.640 --> 03:13.119
occasioning actual bodily harm.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.439
These are matters we take
very seriously indeed.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.759
But I need to know from you,
Mr North, without prejudice

03:18.840 --> 03:20.879
exactly what happened yesterday.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.639
Did DCI Luther assault you?

03:23.200 --> 03:24.919
Look, uh, the truth is...

03:27.000 --> 03:29.359
DCI Luther was defending himself.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.239
I'm not proud to tell you this,
but I threw the first punch.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.679
And, um, quite honestly,
I thought the police were heavy handed.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.599
I will ask you to sign
a statement to this effect.

03:39.680 --> 03:40.919
That's why I'm here.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.919
This is DCI John Luther,
leave a message.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.399
I know how hard that was for you.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.679
I'm fine.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.719
I might work from home today, though.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.479
Thank you.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.959
You might want to try
answering your phone.

04:30.040 --> 04:33.239
Get a reputation for answering
phones and all they do is ring.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.319
You've spoken to Zoe?

04:35.240 --> 04:36.279
- No.
- Ah, well.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.039
Then, you should know that
Mark North gave you a pass.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.639
He's not pressing charges.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.279
So how about we finish
this chat away from the edge?

04:44.360 --> 04:45.999
Do you never do this?

04:47.880 --> 04:51.919
Come up to a really high place and
wonder what it would be like just...

04:52.880 --> 04:54.919
- ...to fall?
- Fall or jump?

04:56.240 --> 04:57.719
- Same thing.
- I beg to differ.

04:57.800 --> 05:02.199
But, mostly I go home, watch
America's Next Top Model.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.359
Do you not worry you're on the
devil's side without even knowing it?

05:06.880 --> 05:07.879
No.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.279
- Just let it go, John.
- I already let him go.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.639
Just didn't finish the job
off properly, did I?

05:14.720 --> 05:17.119
- And nobody shed a tear.
- That doesn't make it right.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.319
Makes it a little bit
less wrong, though.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.639
So, you going to jump?

05:23.480 --> 05:24.479
Probably not.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.399
Well, then I'm bored of this game.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.759
You going back to the factory?

05:31.840 --> 05:33.319
I've been on 18 hours straight.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.559
I'm going home, mate. You should try it.

05:35.640 --> 05:36.639
I might.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.399
Or I might not.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.519
This is Mike Eppley.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.319
Over here, this is Steve Gorman.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.359
Yeah.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.479
- You knew them?
- A little bit.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.039
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.919
If you see Gorman and Eppley,
you go blind. See the scene.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.119
Tell me what you see.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.999
Right. Well, Gorman
was shot at close range.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.119
Double tap to the chest.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.439
Entry wounds are two-three inches apart.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.519
That's good shooting, that is.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.639
And this blood here,
it's real but it won't be the shooter's.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.039
It looks staged to me.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.399
Staged. Look, look, look.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.639
This is an execution.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.319
There can't be. There's no
way the shooter would know

06:27.400 --> 06:28.759
that Gorman and Eppley
would attend this call-out.

06:28.840 --> 06:31.319
No, I didn't say he was
targeting Gorman and Eppley.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.639
I said it was an execution.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.079
I don't understand what that means.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.719
Nor do I. Excuse me, bag that.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.279
Grab that. Thank you.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.319
All right.

06:42.680 --> 06:43.959
Morning, Corinne.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.719
Any suspects, John? Off the record?

06:46.360 --> 06:49.679
- You've got my number.
- Yeah, memorised. Six, six, six.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.119
Direct line.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.359
- Anything?
- Yeah, yeah. Could be.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.599
Cobden Lane links Northlight
Road and Stockwood Hill

06:59.680 --> 07:00.959
- here to here. Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.919
Less than three minutes after the
shooting, this man crossed the road

07:04.000 --> 07:05.279
half a kilometre from
the Stockwood Hill exit.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.359
Is that it?

07:06.440 --> 07:08.999
- Well, we're lucky to get that.
- Yeah, where does he go?

07:09.080 --> 07:11.839
Um, ducks behind shops on Hamilton Row.
Behind that, there's another lane.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.479
Gives out onto allotments,
gardens, a canal.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.239
No more CCTV?

07:16.320 --> 07:18.119
No. Coverage is spotty at best.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.839
Plus, a lot of cameras
in the area have been vandalised.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.239
Vandalised, when?

07:21.400 --> 07:23.639
Uh, well, four were
reported down...

07:25.320 --> 07:26.519
Four went down Monday night.

07:26.600 --> 07:30.199
Yeah, the shooter would have
taken them out, wouldn't he?

07:30.560 --> 07:33.279
All right, so we need to
review the footage going back seven days

07:33.360 --> 07:36.719
before the sabotage, see if we can't
find our man on his recce.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.039
Can I hear that 999 call again?

07:39.120 --> 07:40.119
Yeah.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.399
There's been a shooting,

07:43.480 --> 07:46.279
a man's lying face down
at the north end of Cobden Lane.

07:46.360 --> 07:50.439
Yeah, listen to that,
that's a very efficient call.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.479
No ambiguity,
just essential information.

07:53.920 --> 07:57.599
People leaving crime scenes, yeah,

07:57.680 --> 08:00.039
they hunch, look at the
ground, avoid eye-contact.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.959
Look at him, straight back,
square shoulders.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.639
He's alert, he's calm,
he's aware of his surroundings.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.599
I bet you any money,
he's armed forces.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.319
What, you get that from this?

08:11.400 --> 08:13.399
You ever been in a pub or bar,
whatever, and you know,

08:13.480 --> 08:15.279
you just know the guy
next to you is a copper?

08:15.360 --> 08:18.399
- Yeah, sometimes.
- Yeah, well, I grew up around soldiers.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.679
The way he walks, talks, shoots.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.319
That's a soldier.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.079
All right, so we need to
look up army personnel

08:25.160 --> 08:26.599
that have suffered
at the hands of the police.

08:26.680 --> 08:31.039
Dig up aggravated arrest
complaints filed by veterans

08:31.120 --> 08:33.198
on behalf of themselves,
friends, family, all right?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.679
It'll be a long list.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.558
Those soldiers coming back
from war don't find it easy.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.799
They get depressed, they drink,
they fight, they get arrested.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.759
Justin, this was an execution.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.078
I'm not saying the assassin
was targeting Gorman and Eppley.

08:43.159 --> 08:46.799
But I'm saying, what if he was
targeting their uniforms?

08:46.880 --> 08:48.279
Hmm?

08:48.800 --> 08:50.319
Right, I get it. I'm on it.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.279
What do you want?

08:52.360 --> 08:54.999
I've been reading
Bertrand Russell to a friend of yours.

08:55.800 --> 09:01.199
"Often, the good suffer,
and the wicked prosper,

09:01.280 --> 09:03.599
"and one hardly knows which
of those is the more annoying."

09:03.680 --> 09:06.119
What are you talking about?
Where... Where are you?

09:06.200 --> 09:07.359
If only he could speak.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.639
What tales he could tell.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.639
What are you playing at, Alice?

09:13.160 --> 09:16.239
- I'm investigating you.
- I don't know what that means.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.359
What it means?

09:17.440 --> 09:20.799
I am curious about how Henry
came to be here like this.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.479
Well, there's no need to be curious.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.359
He killed children,
he tried to run away, I caught him,

09:25.440 --> 09:26.439
he fell.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.999
And who actually believes that?

09:30.520 --> 09:31.599
Everyone that matters.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.439
Zoe, for example?

09:35.480 --> 09:36.479
Yes.

09:36.960 --> 09:40.479
- Because do you know what I think?
- I can't imagine.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.639
I think you gave in to your true nature,

09:43.720 --> 09:45.639
just for a second, and let him fall.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.999
And you couldn't take it.
You gave in to guilt and self-loathing.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.519
How am I doing?

09:54.120 --> 09:55.159
Not so well.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.919
But mostly, you were terrified that Zoe
might discover what you'd done

09:58.000 --> 09:59.799
and learn what kind of man
you actually are.

09:59.880 --> 10:02.039
You don't know anything about
me, let alone my marriage.

10:02.120 --> 10:05.079
Well, I can always ask her myself.
See what she says.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.359
Alice, I know this is
just a sport to you,

10:07.440 --> 10:09.199
but you need to stop.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.319
Just stop.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.079
Don't go anywhere near Zoe.
Anywhere near her.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.759
And don't say a word about this to
anyone, do you understand me?

10:16.840 --> 10:18.079
Why, exactly?

10:18.720 --> 10:20.999
Are you scared of what
I'll find out or what she will?

10:26.280 --> 10:27.399
Hey, have we got anything?

10:28.120 --> 10:29.839
Half a dozen
names hit key markers.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.839
Mostly drunk and disorderly,
aggravated assault.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.759
But I'm thinking,
"Nah, it's not enough for our boy."

10:34.840 --> 10:36.759
All right, then, we'll broaden
the search parameters.

10:36.840 --> 10:40.119
Go back to veterans from the first Gulf
War, Northern Ireland, Falklands...

10:40.800 --> 10:41.959
He's in there somewhere.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.439
Police say the
killer is armed and extremely dangerous.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.999
Members of the public who see him should
not attempt to apprehend him,

10:49.080 --> 10:52.279
but immediately dial 999.
Police, at present,

10:52.360 --> 10:54.919
are refusing to comment
on a possible motive for the murders,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.399
but wish to re-assure the public
that they are doing everything

10:57.480 --> 10:58.919
possible to catch the killer.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.039
Terry Lynch.
Ex-46 Commando, Royal Marines.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.119
Decorated veteran.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.199
Eighteen months ago, killed a police
officer while resisting an arrest.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.359
Yeah, I remember this.
Dennis Sorrel. Decent bloke.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.199
Lynch was in a bar,
got into an argument.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.239
Sorrel was the first responder,
tried to calm things down.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.679
- Lynch glassed him. Sorrel bled out.
- Yeah.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.079
And Lynch pleaded "combat stress".

11:20.160 --> 11:21.719
That's maybe not
so mad as it sounds.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.719
About 10% of the prison population
is comprised of veterans,

11:24.800 --> 11:26.079
12,000 from Iraq and Afghanistan.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.079
I don't care what Terry Lynch
did at Goose Green, Desert Storm,

11:29.160 --> 11:30.639
Operation Enduring Freedom.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.959
It doesn't give him
a free pass to kill coppers!

11:34.120 --> 11:37.039
Anyway, he can't be our man.
He's inside. "Life without possibility."

11:37.120 --> 11:39.439
Well, this is his son, Owen Lynch.

11:39.520 --> 11:43.119
Also 46 Commando.
Returned from Afghanistan last year.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.119
Forced to leave under
"administrative discharge,"

11:45.200 --> 11:47.199
which means he had
mental health issues.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.719
- Army left him high and dry.
- Got an address?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.679
Uh, statement from his wife, Rachel.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.799
She threw him out because, "The man who
came back wasn't the man who left."

11:54.880 --> 11:57.679
Yeah, well, he's taken it out on her
once too often, she's thrown him out.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.999
And that was the last time
he showed up on the radar,

12:00.080 --> 12:02.119
until Gorman and Eppley last night.

12:03.440 --> 12:06.359
Gorman and Eppley had nothing to do
with his father being sent down?

12:06.600 --> 12:07.639
No.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.199
Is this as bad as it sounds?

12:20.680 --> 12:23.759
Yeah, false alarm. Prank call.
That's me done for the day.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.479
Put the kettle on, over.

12:44.280 --> 12:47.119
Boss! We've got another officer down.
Harthill Estate.

12:47.680 --> 12:48.679
Come on!

13:14.040 --> 13:15.039
Where was the shooter?

13:15.120 --> 13:16.359
As far as we could establish,
he turned the corner

13:16.440 --> 13:17.479
into the street down here.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.959
He just walked right up and shot her.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.879
- Point blank?
- In the abdomen.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.319
- This isn't right.
- Sir?

13:29.400 --> 13:32.199
Well, last night,
he fires four perfect shots in the dark.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.639
And today, in broad daylight,
he messes up and leaves Hanson alive.

13:35.720 --> 13:36.719
That's not right.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.359
It's not right, it's not right.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.519
Oh, no.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.959
Everyone, take cover!

14:08.040 --> 14:09.039
Mother...

14:16.360 --> 14:18.599
After an unprecedented six fatalities

14:18.680 --> 14:21.919
in less than 24 hours, there is
a sense on the streets of London

14:22.000 --> 14:24.199
that the police presence
is being greatly reduced

14:24.280 --> 14:25.919
in response to these killings.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.799
Despite the Metropolitan Police's
strident denials,

14:28.880 --> 14:31.279
can the emergency services
afford to maintain

14:31.360 --> 14:35.199
their 9-9-9 response commitment
to ordinary people of the capital?

14:35.280 --> 14:38.079
This is Corinne Day, BBC News, London.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.159
- You all right?
- Yeah.

14:42.360 --> 14:45.239
No. I've never been shot at before.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.359
You know, there's people
you can speak to these days.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.439
If you need to.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.319
- What, like a counsellor?
- Yeah. Why not?

14:55.800 --> 14:58.719
If my dad knew if I'd seen a counsellor,
he'd shoot me himself.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.599
All right, everyone.
Roll up, roll up.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.559
Orders from on high.

15:05.880 --> 15:10.439
All personnel will be issued with
bullet-proof vests, where available.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.599
Now, I know "where available"
isn't what you want to hear,

15:12.680 --> 15:15.239
but it's the best we can do,
there we go.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.519
Any questions?

15:20.760 --> 15:21.919
Good.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.519
Now, this has been a bad day.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.759
The worst day most of us
have seen on the job.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.759
Looking around, I'm reminded that many
of us are bedraggled old fossils

15:30.840 --> 15:32.679
with quite a few bad days behind us.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.559
So, what we're going to do,
ladies and gents,

15:35.640 --> 15:37.479
is sniff out this bastard,

15:37.560 --> 15:41.559
then show him and the rest of the world
that no one can do this to us.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.799
So, let's get out there and get him.

15:47.880 --> 15:48.999
Let's have it, then!

17:01.520 --> 17:05.759
My name is Owen Lynch,
ex-46 Commandos, Royal Marines.

17:06.720 --> 17:07.919
This is my dad...

17:09.800 --> 17:11.319
Terry Lynch,

17:11.400 --> 17:14.159
also 46 Commando, Royal Marines.

17:14.920 --> 17:19.279
He was at Bluff Cove when they shot
down an Argentine jet using rifles.

17:19.359 --> 17:22.319
After that, he did two tours
in County Armagh.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.799
His final tour was in
the Helmand province.

17:24.880 --> 17:29.279
Last year, he went to prison for a crime
that would never have been committed

17:29.360 --> 17:31.759
if this country had given him
the respect that he deserved.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.439
But that doesn't happen.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.799
More men who served in the Falklands
have committed suicide since

17:37.880 --> 17:40.199
than died in the war itself.

17:40.280 --> 17:44.119
That may soon be true
of men serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.

17:45.320 --> 17:49.799
My dad was defending himself
from a belligerent arrest.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.519
He shouldn't be in prison for murder.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.919
Police officers will continue
to die until justice is done.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.759
No negotiations will be entered into,

17:59.840 --> 18:02.959
and there will be no
further communication from me.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.799
Freedom for Terry Lynch.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.719
How many views so far?

18:10.960 --> 18:13.079
Thirty thousand and counting.

18:13.520 --> 18:16.239
All major news media outlets
have picked up on it.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.199
It's out there, it's not coming back.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.559
He hardly mentions himself.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.079
Does that not strike you as weird?

18:24.440 --> 18:26.159
I mean, he's just got
back from the war,

18:26.240 --> 18:28.799
his life's in shreds, but this
whole declaration's about

18:28.880 --> 18:32.959
what his dad's done and what his dad's
achieved, where his dad served.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.759
Find out whether
Owen has visited Terry Lynch in prison.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.439
Sir.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.759
I've got to get this.

18:44.840 --> 18:47.079
Stop stalking me, Alice,
you're yesterday's news.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.999
Yes, I heard about the dead policemen.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.359
I was worried about you, John.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.679
About what, that someone
else might get me?

18:56.240 --> 18:59.519
I know how hard men like you
take the death of fellow officers.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.599
It must be like losing family.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.159
I'm not discussing cases with you.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.519
Not even interesting ones?

19:07.600 --> 19:09.239
This isn't interesting, all right?

19:09.320 --> 19:11.079
These are good cops doing good jobs,

19:11.160 --> 19:12.919
being gunned down
on the streets like...

19:13.000 --> 19:14.079
Like what?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.519
That's something we all do,
isn't it, in the end...

19:19.360 --> 19:21.279
Judge who's worth more than whom.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.679
Hitler or Gandhi?

19:23.280 --> 19:25.159
The very young, the very old?

19:25.240 --> 19:28.799
But, to be fair, most of us
don't do it to the extent that you do.

19:28.880 --> 19:33.119
But it does mean the difference between
us is one of degree, not category.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.199
- Ask Henry Madsen.
- All right, you win, okay?

19:36.280 --> 19:37.799
You're too clever for me, Alice.

19:37.880 --> 19:42.079
Flattery to appease a malignant
narcissist, that's a frivolous tactic.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.399
Are you afraid of me?

19:45.920 --> 19:47.359
- Yes.
- Why?

19:47.440 --> 19:49.159
- You know why.
- Do you want me to leave you alone?

19:49.240 --> 19:50.799
- Yes, I do.
- Then answer my questions.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.279
- Why?
- To help with my investigation.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.159
I've got means, opportunity.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.079
You still haven't given me motive.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.559
Why did you let Henry Madsen fall?

20:01.400 --> 20:03.799
I can't say what you want to hear, okay?

20:03.880 --> 20:07.359
Do you think Zoe could
clarify the situation for me?

20:07.440 --> 20:08.519
Last time you spoke to Zoe,

20:08.600 --> 20:11.359
you shoved a knife in her ear, so I
think she'll be disinclined to chat.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.999
It wasn't a knife and
I wasn't asking permission.

20:14.360 --> 20:17.079
And believe me, if I pay
her a visit, she'll talk.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.839
Hey, listen, I don't
respond well to threats.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.719
Hmm, I think coffee, do you want some?

20:30.480 --> 20:31.919
- Tea.
- Tea? Builder's?

20:34.680 --> 20:35.719
Is it John?

20:40.640 --> 20:41.679
John?

20:41.880 --> 20:44.439
- Have you got a minute?
- Not to argue, I don't.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.479
No, just, I want to ask you something.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.519
Um, I need you to leave London.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.239
Not for long. Just a few days.

20:51.320 --> 20:54.319
Go to your mum and dad's or,
um, Mark's parents, or whatever.

20:55.680 --> 20:59.479
- What's wrong? Why?
- I've received a viable threat.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.959
- What kind of a threat?
- From Alice Morgan.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.759
He's playing mind games, right?
It's a control thing.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.159
He wants to control you. He always did.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.759
You don't know him!

21:14.840 --> 21:17.159
It's pathetic. Honestly...
What is he going to do next?

21:17.240 --> 21:20.399
Is he going to bang you on the head,
drag you to a cave by the hair?

21:21.160 --> 21:22.319
Do you like this kind of thing?

21:22.400 --> 21:23.959
This controlling, macho bullshit?

21:24.040 --> 21:26.559
I can't believe you're
being so childish about this.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.359
I can't believe you let this man
turn you into such an arsehole.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.039
- He received a threat.
- Says him.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.559
Oh, come on, we're not
interrogating your masculinity here!

21:35.640 --> 21:38.879
Yeah, well, we don't have to worry about
that, do we? I'm secure enough

21:38.960 --> 21:42.119
to weather any comparison
you care to make with your ex-husband.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.239
Of course you are. And you shouldn't
be questioning my motives.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.279
It's just...
Look, John knows this stuff,

21:48.360 --> 21:49.519
and if he thinks we should leave,

21:49.600 --> 21:52.039
I honestly think we should
take him seriously.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.159
- Do you know what I think?
- What, this last half hour wasn't it?

21:55.600 --> 21:57.359
You know what I think?

21:57.840 --> 21:58.999
If there was a threat...
If there was a threat,

21:59.080 --> 22:01.639
a genuine threat to your safety,

22:01.720 --> 22:04.479
there would already
be a security detail outside the door.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.559
Zoe, the police look after
their own. He's lying.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.479
I don't know why he's lying,
but he's lying.

22:13.720 --> 22:14.959
That's really not fair.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.999
Well, a simple solution.

22:17.080 --> 22:20.519
Why don't we just pick up
the phone and dial his boss?

22:22.400 --> 22:24.639
See what she thinks about this threat.

22:30.800 --> 22:33.919
- I got what you wanted.
- Footage from the prison?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.959
Okay, so you look here at Owen Lynch's
most recent visit to his dad,

22:37.040 --> 22:40.559
should be just over
two weeks ago. No audio, of course.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.119
No hugs. No smiles.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.279
Owen's nervous. Whatever Terry's saying,

22:47.360 --> 22:49.439
Owen's finding it profoundly stressful.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.959
When did Terry lose his appeal?

22:52.040 --> 22:53.279
Uh, about a month ago.

22:53.360 --> 22:55.599
So this is, what, two weeks ago?

22:55.680 --> 22:56.719
Yeah.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.359
Do you know what we're looking at?

22:59.440 --> 23:02.039
We're looking at Owen
receiving his orders.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.239
Crikey.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.279
Don't tell me.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.279
I've got a visitor.

24:17.680 --> 24:18.679
Gotcha.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.839
Right, you brief John,
I'll trace this number.

25:04.200 --> 25:07.239
Two schoolgirls are coming home
from Sunday school one day,

25:07.320 --> 25:11.639
and one turns to the other
and says, "Do you believe in the devil?"

25:12.040 --> 25:14.119
The other one says,
"Don't be silly, of course not.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.999
"The devil's like Santa.

25:16.480 --> 25:18.039
"It's only your dad."

25:21.080 --> 25:23.399
I always thought that was funny.

25:25.760 --> 25:28.399
The thing is about little boys
is that they

25:28.480 --> 25:30.959
worship their dads like gods.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.639
The more invisible he is,

25:33.720 --> 25:36.519
the more arbitrary in his
punishment and rewards,

25:36.600 --> 25:39.639
the more they crave his approval.

25:42.520 --> 25:45.199
I know what it must
be like for Owen. My dad was a soldier.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.399
1st Armoured Division,
7th Armoured Brigade.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.319
So, Germany, mostly.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.039
Canada, a little bit of Cyprus.

25:52.480 --> 25:57.159
I bet your old man was a right
old hard bastard, wasn't he?

25:58.960 --> 26:02.679
Well, see, it was tough for him, you
see. 'Cause here I am, a big lad,

26:02.760 --> 26:04.439
eager to please,

26:04.520 --> 26:07.319
wanting to care about
the things he cared about,

26:07.400 --> 26:09.239
Army, sports.

26:10.520 --> 26:11.919
No, there was nothing.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.399
He wanted me to box,

26:13.480 --> 26:17.359
and I just wanted to read
books, write, meet girls.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.999
In the end, I just gave up
trying to make him proud,

26:22.080 --> 26:24.199
'cause I just knew
it was never going to happen.

26:24.280 --> 26:27.639
But this daft bastard,
he hasn't given up, though, has he?

26:28.400 --> 26:31.159
More than anything,
he just wants to make his dad proud.

26:32.400 --> 26:33.959
Now, Terry,

26:34.040 --> 26:35.599
I know you gave him a job to do,

26:35.680 --> 26:39.199
but I don't think you quite
appreciate the implications.

26:40.760 --> 26:43.679
In crimes like this,
half the offenders end up

26:43.760 --> 26:47.159
shooting themselves in the face
and the other half get shot by police.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.399
Your boy's going to die
unless you help him.

26:49.480 --> 26:50.479
Oh, yeah?

26:52.040 --> 26:53.039
By doing what?

26:53.120 --> 26:57.079
Go on camera.
Tell him to stop. Rescind the order.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.919
All right, I could do that, yeah.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.759
- But?
- I need a reduction in sentence.

27:05.840 --> 27:08.399
That's not going to happen,
Terry. You killed a police officer.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.119
I'm not asking for a pardon.
I'm asking for a reduction.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.399
I got life for murder.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.639
It should've been five
years for manslaughter, with diminished.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.919
Now, I'll take that, with time served.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.799
Even if there was a precedent,
there'd be no time.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.439
I don't know about that, 'cause Owen can
look after himself, can't he?

27:27.520 --> 27:30.639
He could be out there
for weeks, mate, before you catch him.

27:30.720 --> 27:34.359
- Weeks and weeks...
- This is your son we're talking about!

27:34.560 --> 27:37.319
And you're sitting
in here, killing him.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.439
Not if you give me what I want.

27:38.520 --> 27:39.999
You're not getting what you want!

27:44.840 --> 27:49.279
Five years with time served
and transfer to an open prison.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.439
Now, if you can do that for me,

27:52.520 --> 27:54.039
you can come back and you can bring

27:54.120 --> 27:56.319
all the cameras that you want.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.359
Boss, we've triangulated the signal.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.079
Static? Mobile?

28:08.160 --> 28:09.879
No movement.
He's keeping his head down.

28:09.960 --> 28:11.159
Sensible boy.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.719
This is Teller. We've got a
possible location for Owen Lynch.

28:14.800 --> 28:17.719
We need to scramble
Tactical Support. Address?

28:17.800 --> 28:20.039
We found a SIM card,
one number listed in the contacts.

28:20.120 --> 28:23.759
Belongs to a pay-as-you-go,
which we've traced to 185 Ellwyn Mews.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.559
That's a vacant property,
overlooked by a trading estate.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.919
Commercial buildings.
Makes for a decent bolt hole.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.359
Owen Lynch won't let himself
get caught. He'd rather die.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.279
Yeah, and nobody seems to be having
much of a problem with that.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.079
Are you worried about something?

28:50.960 --> 28:52.439
Getting shot at, mostly.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.759
That's it, is it?

28:53.840 --> 28:55.999
Be a good boy. Use your words.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.599
It's just, I've been thinking.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.279
- What?
- One number on the SIM card.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.319
- One number.
- One number, one son.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.519
Yeah, I know, but it's niggling me.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.279
On a day like this, if all you've got is
a niggle, you're laughing, mate.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.439
I know, but you're in prison,

29:10.520 --> 29:12.599
got nothing else
to think about but one number,

29:12.680 --> 29:13.999
one important number.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.279
Well, you memorise it, don't you?

29:17.360 --> 29:19.559
You don't write it down.
You memorise it.

29:19.640 --> 29:22.719
Ian, we've got a Special Forces nut job
out there gunning down uniforms.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.079
And this phone is our sole lead.
And we don't ignore leads.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.239
So, all we can do is
go in hard and noisy

29:27.320 --> 29:29.319
and as ready as is
humanly possible to be.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.759
We let Tactical do their job,
and when it's done, we buy them a drink

29:31.840 --> 29:33.359
and tell them their biceps are sexy.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.599
Done?

29:34.680 --> 29:36.639
- Yeah.
- Good, let's go.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.639
Armed police! Lay down your weapons!

29:53.360 --> 29:56.319
Armed police! Lay down your weapons!

29:58.160 --> 30:02.799
Room clear! Room clear! Room clear!

30:04.360 --> 30:05.479
Get out! Get out!

30:05.560 --> 30:06.959
Oh, my God, get out!

30:32.480 --> 30:35.519
Repeat,
CO19 were in the building. People lost.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.879
Get them all ambulances,
and get them now.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.119
CO19?

31:04.480 --> 31:06.119
Four confirmed, six injured.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.519
Well, if there's one thing you learn

31:09.600 --> 31:12.119
from being in Iraq,
it's how to make an IED.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.319
- Lynch?
- Still searching.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.639
Helicopters, ground units,
dogs, door to door.

31:18.720 --> 31:19.759
No sign.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.119
But it was a remote-detonated bomb.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.799
He had to be close by, watching.

31:25.160 --> 31:28.399
I mean that puts him within
500 metres, line of sight.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.079
I don't get it.
How could he just slip away like that?

31:30.160 --> 31:31.359
All right, it's not your fault.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.399
He wanted us
to find that SIM card.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.919
I bit down on it like a...

31:35.840 --> 31:37.679
...Mars bar. Of course it's my fault.

31:39.600 --> 31:40.679
It's official.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.519
As of five minutes ago,

31:42.600 --> 31:45.079
the Owen Lynch operation
was passed up to Anti-Terrorism.

31:45.440 --> 31:46.679
It's out of our hands.

31:46.760 --> 31:49.359
All they're gonna do
is give Terry Lynch what he wants.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.639
More blood. More dead coppers.
We can't let him do that.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.519
I don't have much choice, do I?

31:54.320 --> 31:57.759
Look, we don't have
to like it, but we do have to accept it.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.679
We're off the case.
Suck it up, move on.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.999
Where are you going?

32:37.840 --> 32:38.879
Guv.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.399
- What's this now?
- Eppley's radio.

32:44.040 --> 32:47.599
Right, listen, we use Airwave,
right? Secure, digital.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.759
It's impossible for civilians
to buy a scanner and listen in.

32:50.840 --> 32:51.879
And?

32:52.080 --> 32:53.519
Owen swapped them.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.759
He swapped it.
You need to call Anti-Terrorism,

32:57.840 --> 33:00.599
and tell them he's listening
to everything we say.

33:01.400 --> 33:04.559
Okay, I need you to understand,
Detective Chief Inspector,

33:04.640 --> 33:06.159
that to alert them is all we can do.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.439
We can't act on this information
because this case is no longer ours.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.399
All right? Am I being transparent, here?
Tell me if I'm being at all ambiguous.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.479
Because there's nothing
we can do with this, except pass it on.

33:14.600 --> 33:17.479
There's nothing we can do
'cause no one knows where Owen Lynch is.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.759
And he's going to keep killing until
someone finds him and stops him.

33:20.840 --> 33:21.919
They'll find him.

33:23.440 --> 33:24.479
Oh, yeah? How?

33:27.680 --> 33:30.639
So, here's what's gonna happen.
Anti-Terrorism's gonna go in

33:30.720 --> 33:32.759
big and noisy and Owen dies.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.959
Yeah, well, then, he dies happy,
doesn't he, doing the job he loves.

33:37.040 --> 33:38.119
That's more than
most of us get, isn't it?

33:38.200 --> 33:40.159
Yeah, that's gonna be
a damn sight more than you're gonna get.

33:40.800 --> 33:44.279
What's that then, eh?
You going to bash me up, are you?

33:44.360 --> 33:46.239
Or do you think I can't take a slap?

33:46.320 --> 33:48.599
Oh, I'm sure you can take a slap.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.279
I'm going to send my boy for you.

33:50.600 --> 33:54.879
Yeah, you know, picture the
scene, doorbell rings, click, bang!

33:54.960 --> 33:57.439
Your skull goes splat, straight out.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.319
So, go on then, do your worst.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.239
I'd really like to.

34:07.480 --> 34:11.518
But murdering people leaves
a lot of fuss and bother behind.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.799
So, I thought,
"No, there's got to be another way."

34:17.159 --> 34:19.998
Now, I know a lot of
people in this prison.

34:20.080 --> 34:23.079
Lot of screws, lot of inmates,
lot of nasty people, really.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.559
But they don't bother you.

34:24.639 --> 34:27.559
Because the thing about you, Terry, is
that you're a hard bastard, aren't you?

34:27.639 --> 34:28.679
Mmm?

34:28.760 --> 34:31.918
I mean, you can't be
seen giving into threats

34:32.000 --> 34:34.359
'cause then you wouldn't
be a hard bastard any more, would you?

34:34.440 --> 34:39.359
And you'd rather die than lose all the
respect that you've earned in here.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.279
I'm gonna strip you of that dignity

34:41.360 --> 34:44.119
and make you the most
reviled prisoner in here.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.119
Oh, I'd like to see you try.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.079
I'm so glad you said that

34:49.159 --> 34:52.438
because everyone
knows I searched your cell.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.639
It would be the easiest thing in the
world to show them that this

34:57.720 --> 34:58.839
is what we found.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.039
- Yeah?
- Go on, have a look.

35:08.320 --> 35:11.359
What've you been up to,
you wonky bastard, eh?

35:13.040 --> 35:14.119
Go on.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.839
I have to tell you,
I haven't been able to

35:21.920 --> 35:25.879
take a look at them myself, but I am
told that none of those little boys

35:25.960 --> 35:28.159
are more than nine years old.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.119
It's giving you
that little thrill, isn't it?

35:35.200 --> 35:37.599
Oh, all right.
There's Terry Lynch the hard man.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.879
But now there's Terry Lynch the nunce.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.039
No, no, no one would believe it.

35:44.120 --> 35:46.479
No one, right? That's what
I thought, no one,

35:46.560 --> 35:49.759
but then I thought to myself,
"Terry's got a boy."

35:50.280 --> 35:51.319
A boy.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.559
And he can get his boy
to do anything he tells him.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.559
Hey, even kill cops.

35:56.640 --> 35:58.679
What do you have to do

35:58.760 --> 36:02.719
to a boy to get him to do that,
eh? To have that kind of control?

36:02.800 --> 36:04.319
Terry, will you tell me?

36:06.200 --> 36:09.279
What did you do to young Owen?
What did you do?

36:09.360 --> 36:11.399
You're a piece of shit! Ain't you?

36:11.480 --> 36:12.839
This is a onetime deal, Terry.

36:12.920 --> 36:17.439
One time only.
So, you better give me what I want.

36:28.600 --> 36:29.639
Have you left yet?

36:29.720 --> 36:31.079
No, we're still here.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.479
What, I don't believe it. Why?

36:32.560 --> 36:35.599
John, it's illegal
to threaten someone's life.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.479
If Alice Morgan threatened me,
why don't you just arrest her?

36:38.560 --> 36:41.079
- I can't, okay?
- Why not?

36:42.920 --> 36:44.759
- It's complicated.
- It always is.

36:44.840 --> 36:46.719
What's this woman got on you?
What have you done?

36:46.800 --> 36:48.679
Listen, I haven't got
time for this, all right.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.279
I just need you to trust me.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.359
Thing is, I'm not sure I do.

36:54.200 --> 36:56.239
If I called Rose Teller,
would she know about this?

36:56.320 --> 36:58.439
- Have you called her?
- Not yet.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.519
Should I?

37:00.960 --> 37:02.799
No, don't do that. Don't call her.

37:04.920 --> 37:07.159
Well, that tells me
everything, doesn't it?

37:08.440 --> 37:10.879
So, what's really going on?
What have you done?

37:10.960 --> 37:13.119
Listen, I need you
to trust me, all right?

37:13.200 --> 37:16.079
At the very least, I need you to lock
your doors, lock your windows.

37:16.160 --> 37:19.079
And if anything happens,
you call me immediately, all right?

37:22.080 --> 37:23.719
So, you were right.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.079
He's lying.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.279
I've had 20 years.

37:31.600 --> 37:35.159
When do I learn, it's 20 years.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.279
God, I'm sorry.

37:43.960 --> 37:45.039
I'm so sorry.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.079
When does this go out?

37:48.160 --> 37:49.959
Lead story, main bulletin,
say ten past 10:00.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.759
- Definitely sure about this?
- Yeah.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.159
Okay, let's go.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.919
And we're rolling.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.199
And as night falls on a stunned capital

37:58.280 --> 37:59.479
as the police, ambulance

37:59.560 --> 38:03.399
and fire crews respond
to 999 calls in full body armour...

38:03.480 --> 38:04.479
Thank you.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.879
Corrine Day has been
talking to Detective Chief Inspector

38:05.960 --> 38:07.039
- John Luther.
- Hmm?

38:07.120 --> 38:08.519
- Senior Investigating Officer...
- What?

38:08.600 --> 38:11.199
...of the so-called 999 shootings.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.119
Detective chief
Inspector Luther,

38:13.200 --> 38:15.559
what do we know about
Owen Lynch's motivation?

38:15.640 --> 38:17.599
We know that Owen prides himself

38:17.680 --> 38:19.799
on being a soldier
from a long line of soldiers,

38:19.880 --> 38:23.119
but we've interviewed his
commanding officers, military doctors,

38:23.200 --> 38:24.799
- psychiatrists...
- Holy shit.

38:24.880 --> 38:27.199
Oh, no, no, no! Sergeant Ripley!

38:27.280 --> 38:29.719
Owen had an impressive
number of kills to his name.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.559
They were very aware
of his character flaws.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.679
What flaws are they?

38:33.760 --> 38:35.719
Well, Owen was never soldier material.

38:35.920 --> 38:39.999
He was a, uh, maladjusted child who was
raised on too much TV and video games.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.399
Is any of this even true?

38:42.480 --> 38:45.559
- Not even slightly.
- What we do know,

38:45.640 --> 38:48.199
um, is that on his return
from Afghanistan,

38:48.280 --> 38:53.239
Owen developed severe
sexual difficulties, and, uh, despite

38:53.320 --> 38:57.519
his claims on a so-called mission,
it's quite likely that these murders

38:57.600 --> 38:59.239
are a sexual release.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.239
A way of dealing with
his sexual and personal demons.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.159
God, what's he doing?

39:05.680 --> 39:07.199
He's making
himself into a target,

39:08.080 --> 39:10.959
drawing Lynch's fire from
the police force in general.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.439
This is suicide.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.519
And partly because his dad isn't quite
the hero he'd have us believe.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.679
His dad is an alcoholic.
All right? A wife beater.

39:19.760 --> 39:23.119
Who, incidentally, denies all
knowledge of his son's activities.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.959
And how close
did you say you were to catching him?

39:26.600 --> 39:28.639
Corinne, I've just had a long
conversation with his dad,

39:28.720 --> 39:31.359
who has provided me with vital
information and, uh...

39:32.880 --> 39:35.479
Owen, you'll see me soon.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.879
Thank you,
Corinne, and now to other news.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.239
Prime Minister...

39:58.360 --> 39:59.439
What's that?

40:22.760 --> 40:23.759
Mmm.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.239
Alice Morgan.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.159
A friend of John's.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.879
We've met before, actually.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.639
Leave, right now, please.

40:36.720 --> 40:37.879
Or...

40:38.400 --> 40:40.759
Well, go ahead.
But it won't be good for John.

40:40.960 --> 40:41.999
Bollocks to John.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.359
So, how can we help you?

40:48.960 --> 40:51.359
I've been wondering,
why do you think he does it?

40:51.440 --> 40:53.839
- Why does who do what?
- John. His job.

40:54.480 --> 40:55.799
It takes such a toll.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.319
Why does he put himself through it?

40:57.400 --> 40:58.559
I don't see how this is relevant.

40:58.640 --> 41:02.599
Well, it is. Right this second,
you might actually be helping him.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.079
What do you think compels him to do it?

41:08.760 --> 41:10.679
He believes one life is all we have.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.439
Life and love.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.279
Whoever takes life steals everything.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.159
- And do you agree?
- I don't know.

41:21.080 --> 41:23.479
I think if he'd read
a different book by a different writer

41:23.560 --> 41:26.039
at just the right time in his life,
he'd have been a different man.

41:26.560 --> 41:28.239
He'd have been happier
as a priest than...

41:28.320 --> 41:29.359
Than what?

41:31.640 --> 41:32.799
Than what he is.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.759
It must have been difficult for you.

41:38.560 --> 41:39.879
Impossible, really.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.639
How does anyone compete
with a calling like that?

41:44.880 --> 41:45.919
He wasn't blind.

41:47.840 --> 41:48.879
He knew what it was costing him.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.679
What, like his marriage?

41:50.760 --> 41:52.359
That's part of it, yeah.

41:52.440 --> 41:55.039
- But you don't sound bitter.
- I'm not bitter. I'm...

41:55.120 --> 41:56.119
I'm proud of him.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.759
You just don't
want to be married to him.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.359
Not any more, no.

42:01.840 --> 42:02.879
Why not?

42:05.400 --> 42:06.399
I'm not going to answer that.

42:08.480 --> 42:11.919
Is it because he tried
to kill Henry Madsen?

42:15.240 --> 42:18.519
- No.
- But that is what you believe.

42:19.640 --> 42:22.279
Do you know what Henry Madsen did?

42:22.600 --> 42:24.399
I have some idea, yes.

42:25.520 --> 42:27.399
He was a freak of nature.

42:28.760 --> 42:29.799
Anyone would be tempted.

42:29.880 --> 42:33.519
We're not talking about anyone,
we're talking about John.

42:33.600 --> 42:37.199
Do you think he tried to kill
him on behalf of the dead?

42:43.720 --> 42:44.719
Well...

42:45.880 --> 42:48.079
I think that answers the question.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.039
It was lovely meeting you both.

42:55.960 --> 42:57.359
Thank you for your time.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.879
Oh, my God.

43:36.760 --> 43:39.319
- He seriously told you nothing?
- He seriously told me nothing.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.199
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

43:41.280 --> 43:42.319
Shit!

43:42.520 --> 43:46.159
Detective Chief
Inspector John Luther to Control. Over.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.239
Boss!

43:47.320 --> 43:49.999
Detective Chief Inspector
John Luther to Control. Over.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.399
This is Control, DCI Luther.

43:51.480 --> 43:52.879
What is your status? Over.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.799
I'm en route to the
Kings Hill Estate. Over.

43:55.880 --> 43:57.839
Please clarify. Over.

43:57.920 --> 44:01.159
There's a flat there that belonged
to one of Terry Lynch's old pals.

44:01.520 --> 44:02.839
Owen used to visit
it when he was a boy.

44:03.720 --> 44:06.839
Now, I'm betting that he's been there,
maybe left something behind

44:06.920 --> 44:08.359
that we can use to find him. Over.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.479
Well, hang back on that. Do not proceed
unassisted to the Kings Hill Estate.

44:11.960 --> 44:14.879
This is now a matter for Anti-Terrorism.
Do not proceed.

44:14.960 --> 44:17.599
Repeat, do not proceed to
the Kings Hill Estate. Over.

44:17.680 --> 44:18.719
Negative.

44:18.800 --> 44:20.079
I'm three minutes away.

44:21.280 --> 44:25.359
I repeat. I am three
minutes away. Over.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.879
We cannot provide armed
backup. Do you read me?

44:29.960 --> 44:31.639
We cannot provide armed backup. Over.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.559
Get CO19 out there.

44:39.800 --> 44:40.919
This is DCI Reed.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.839
We need a first response
tactical unit to the Kings Hill Estate.

44:43.920 --> 44:45.039
It's Owen Lynch.

44:45.120 --> 44:48.759
We have an unarmed, unassisted
officer going in there, so do it now!

44:52.520 --> 44:55.839
He wanted to guarantee that Owen Lynch
overheard him when he made that call.

44:56.440 --> 44:59.079
He brought Eppley's radio to me
so I'd warn Anti-Terrorism

44:59.160 --> 45:00.839
and they'd shut down their comms.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.599
We cleared the airwaves for him.

45:05.240 --> 45:06.559
He's made Owen Lynch hate him.

45:06.800 --> 45:10.799
It's like he's waving a white flag,
stepping onto enemy territory.

45:10.880 --> 45:11.879
As if he's going there to...

45:12.640 --> 45:14.039
- What?
- Boss.

45:14.520 --> 45:15.519
What?

45:15.600 --> 45:18.919
I found John up on the roof
this morning. Right on the edge.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.479
So?

45:21.800 --> 45:23.399
It's just...

45:23.480 --> 45:26.199
I'm not completely sure
he expects to walk away from this.

45:36.200 --> 45:39.159
- CO19?
- ETA, 13 minutes.

45:39.240 --> 45:40.919
That's not quick enough.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.559
He's dead. The bloody idiot, he's dead.

46:31.560 --> 46:32.559
Luther, is it?

46:37.080 --> 46:38.799
John. Yeah.

46:39.520 --> 46:40.639
Why are you here, John?

46:41.200 --> 46:42.759
Because I want you to stop.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.999
You ex-services? You look it.

46:49.920 --> 46:51.159
A lot of coppers are.

46:52.720 --> 46:55.199
Mike Eppley, the man you killed
the other night. He was. But me?

46:55.280 --> 46:56.279
No, I...

46:57.280 --> 46:58.599
I grew up around it.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.399
Lace your hands on
top of your head, John.

47:05.560 --> 47:07.119
- You got a death wish?
- No.

47:07.200 --> 47:08.239
Then what?

47:08.840 --> 47:10.119
Oh, God!

47:11.000 --> 47:12.519
Oh, God!

47:14.560 --> 47:16.479
Terry... Terry gave you up, Owen.

47:17.760 --> 47:20.799
I threatened him and he cried
and sobbed like a girl.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.119
And he begged me not to hurt him.

47:23.200 --> 47:24.999
And he just gave you up.
Just like that.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.159
- You liar.
- Ah!

47:28.000 --> 47:29.039
Oh...

47:29.120 --> 47:30.279
You're right.

47:31.560 --> 47:34.839
I am lying. He didn't cry
and he didn't sob.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.839
I just said that to
make you feel better.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.599
No, he just gave you up
because he was frightened.

47:39.680 --> 47:40.679
Hey. Hey!

47:41.200 --> 47:42.199
God!

47:42.280 --> 47:43.279
Oh!

47:43.360 --> 47:45.919
Come on. Owen.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.839
How do you think I knew you were here?

47:48.480 --> 47:51.439
How do you think I found you, eh?

47:51.520 --> 47:53.239
Who else knew you were here?

47:55.920 --> 47:58.319
You didn't... You didn't even
want to be a soldier, did you?

47:58.400 --> 47:59.399
Eh?

48:00.600 --> 48:03.799
You used to piss your bed,
at 11 years old, piss your bed,

48:03.880 --> 48:06.399
and Daddy used to come
in and beat you for it.

48:06.480 --> 48:09.079
And the more he hit you,
the more you pissed your bed.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.679
And you were scared, weren't you?

48:10.760 --> 48:12.439
You were scared of him,
scared of the dogs, scared of...

48:12.520 --> 48:13.639
Shut up!

48:13.720 --> 48:15.999
Get down now! On your face!

48:16.080 --> 48:19.159
Get down! On your knees.
On your knees, get on your knees.

48:19.240 --> 48:20.479
No!

48:21.880 --> 48:23.799
- Get down!
- I told him.

48:25.240 --> 48:27.879
I said, "You're killing your boy!"

48:27.960 --> 48:29.479
You know what he said?

48:30.200 --> 48:33.119
He said, "Well, at least
he dies doing something he loves."

48:36.160 --> 48:39.119
You recognise that as
something he's said to you before?

48:39.200 --> 48:40.199
Eh?

48:41.240 --> 48:44.279
You're an embarrassment to him, Owen.

48:45.760 --> 48:47.079
He's ashamed of you.

48:48.440 --> 48:50.559
He's ashamed of you,
he's embarrassed of you.

48:50.640 --> 48:52.919
He asked you to do one
thing, just one thing!

48:53.000 --> 48:54.879
And you couldn't
even do that, could you?

48:54.960 --> 48:56.199
You couldn't do it!

48:57.960 --> 48:59.719
He told me all your secrets.

49:00.440 --> 49:03.759
Just so I could humiliate you.

49:04.560 --> 49:07.839
He even told me that when
you got back from the war,

49:07.920 --> 49:11.279
you pissed your bed even more,
and he started laughing.

49:14.760 --> 49:17.479
That's why I'm here, Owen!

49:17.560 --> 49:19.239
That's why I'm here.

49:19.320 --> 49:22.799
I'm just here to tell you the
type of man that your dad is!

49:25.840 --> 49:30.479
Don't die for him, Owen.
God! Don't die for him.

49:31.240 --> 49:33.159
Not him, not him,

49:34.560 --> 49:35.559
not him.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.879
What do I do?

49:43.760 --> 49:44.879
What do you do?

49:46.560 --> 49:47.719
You come with me.

49:50.040 --> 49:52.319
My dad killed one copper.

49:52.400 --> 49:53.479
Look what happened to him.

49:53.560 --> 49:54.879
Owen, you're not your dad.

49:56.360 --> 49:57.799
You're not your dad.

50:00.760 --> 50:01.759
No.

50:03.120 --> 50:04.159
I'm not.

50:08.920 --> 50:09.919
What are you doing?

50:12.560 --> 50:15.919
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ,
what are you doing?

50:20.600 --> 50:23.079
Do you ever get the feeling
that you've been cheated?

50:32.920 --> 50:34.239
Don't!

50:41.120 --> 50:42.119
Ah!

50:45.840 --> 50:46.839
All right.

50:52.760 --> 50:53.959
Four down, eh?

50:55.080 --> 50:56.359
Two to go.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.799
Jesus.

51:12.280 --> 51:13.279
Ah!

51:20.440 --> 51:23.679
Stay down! Stay down, stay down!

51:23.760 --> 51:25.039
You'll be all right.

51:26.440 --> 51:27.759
You'll be all right.

51:30.000 --> 51:30.999
Ah!

51:48.880 --> 51:52.279
Okay, Owen,
we know that you're scared.

51:55.440 --> 51:58.199
We know that right now
you feel like you're in enemy territory,

51:58.280 --> 51:59.839
but that's not how it is, okay?

52:02.280 --> 52:04.319
You're protected by the law.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.839
We're not going to hurt you.

52:08.280 --> 52:11.519
We need you to understand
that we're not your enemy.

52:18.160 --> 52:20.959
We know that you're not
responsible for what you did.

52:21.040 --> 52:24.559
Not really. I'd like to
acknowledge that here on record.

52:25.160 --> 52:28.479
In the light of this, we are prepared
to make certain recommendations

52:28.560 --> 52:30.599
when it comes to trial and sentencing.

52:35.040 --> 52:38.279
Owen, as far as we're concerned,
the ultimate responsibility

52:38.360 --> 52:40.439
for the death of these
officers lies with your dad.

52:42.320 --> 52:43.919
It's your dad we want.

52:44.360 --> 52:46.639
But we need your help
if we're going to do that.

52:47.200 --> 52:50.719
If we're going to punish this man for
what he did to you, we need your help.

53:05.240 --> 53:06.759
My name is Owen Lynch.

53:06.840 --> 53:09.079
Sergeant, Royal Marines.

53:09.160 --> 53:10.959
2-5-2-3-3-0-1.

53:11.120 --> 53:13.519
Owen, we're trying to help
you here. Let us help you.

53:13.800 --> 53:15.679
My name is Owen Lynch.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.599
Sergeant, Royal Marines.

53:18.200 --> 53:20.759
- 2-5-2-3-3-0-1.
- Owen.

53:20.920 --> 53:22.599
My name is Owen Lynch.

53:22.680 --> 53:25.879
Sergeant, Royal Marines. 2-5-2-3-3-0-1.

53:39.160 --> 53:43.519
So, what do you have to say
that can't be said on the phone?

53:47.680 --> 53:50.239
If you don't leave Zoe alone, Alice,

53:51.520 --> 53:52.519
I will kill you.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.839
You'd do that, would you?

53:55.520 --> 53:57.359
If that's what it takes to stop you.

53:57.520 --> 54:00.159
Is that what it took
to stop Henry Madsen?

54:01.480 --> 54:03.439
You need to let it be.

54:03.520 --> 54:04.679
I mean, you really do.

54:04.760 --> 54:07.679
Don't worry, I've concluded
my investigation.

54:09.760 --> 54:11.319
I think I got the right man.

54:15.480 --> 54:17.119
I like her, by the way.

54:17.760 --> 54:18.799
Zoe.

54:20.800 --> 54:23.439
I don't know what that
means coming from your mouth.

54:23.760 --> 54:24.919
She's strong.

54:25.600 --> 54:26.839
She has dignity.

54:28.400 --> 54:30.319
She loves you a great deal.

54:32.400 --> 54:35.039
Well, she has a funny way of showing it.

54:36.520 --> 54:39.119
- She knows what you did.
- How do you mean?

54:39.200 --> 54:40.359
She's always known.

54:40.440 --> 54:42.319
It didn't change anything.

54:43.040 --> 54:44.159
It's not why she left.

54:44.840 --> 54:47.999
You made her watch what it did
to you and never told her why.

54:48.080 --> 54:50.599
She couldn't look at
it any more, what you...

54:50.800 --> 54:52.359
Do to yourself.

54:54.880 --> 54:57.399
She felt she'd lost you to the dead.

54:59.560 --> 55:02.839
Why do you do this?
I don't understand. I'm... I'm lost.

55:02.920 --> 55:04.159
Because we're friends.

55:04.240 --> 55:06.359
I want to make you feel better.

55:06.440 --> 55:07.839
We're not friends.

55:09.400 --> 55:10.959
I don't know what we are,
but we're not friends.

55:11.040 --> 55:13.199
Whatever else has happened,
it's in the past.

55:13.280 --> 55:15.679
The past isn't dead, Alice.
It's not even the past.

55:15.760 --> 55:18.079
Are you still frightened of me?

55:18.160 --> 55:20.639
- Yes.
- Because I have no wish to hurt you

55:21.520 --> 55:25.559
and I certainly have no wish to hurt
Zoe. I think she's admirable.

55:27.360 --> 55:29.319
Are you saying you'll leave her alone?

55:31.920 --> 55:33.319
I need you to leave her alone.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.159
Brownie's honour.

55:44.240 --> 55:46.279
One coffee doesn't make us friends.

55:58.360 --> 55:59.959
We think it's blood.

56:12.440 --> 56:14.999
Change the state of play.

56:21.800 --> 56:24.199
You're a police officer.
What you're doing's wrong.
