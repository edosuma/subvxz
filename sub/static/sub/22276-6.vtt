AARON MAHNKE: Just south of Mexico City,

00:15.641 --> 00:18.018
in the middle of the Xochimilco canals,

00:18.060 --> 00:19.562
is an island...

00:19.603 --> 00:22.898
an island with a disturbing history.

00:22.940 --> 00:27.611
Isla de Las MuÃ±ecas...
Island of the Dolls...

00:27.653 --> 00:30.656
so named because, in the mid-1950s,

00:30.698 --> 00:33.659
a man named Julian Santana moved here.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.494
He told some people

00:35.536 --> 00:38.581
he was abandoning his wife and child.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.792
One day, after years of seclusion,

00:41.834 --> 00:45.504
Julian is said to have made
a horrifying discovery...

00:48.340 --> 00:51.218
the lifeless body of a drowned girl.

00:55.097 --> 00:57.767
Nearby, he found something else...

00:57.808 --> 00:59.769
a doll.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.355
A precious possession

01:03.397 --> 01:05.441
she must have clutched
in her final moments.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.488
According to those who knew Don Julian,

01:10.529 --> 01:13.949
he believed the spirit of
the girl began to haunt him...

01:13.991 --> 01:16.869
a curse for leaving his family.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.041
So he retrieved the doll

01:22.082 --> 01:24.668
and cared for it as
if it were his child.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.174
He hoped that this might
appease the girl's ghost.

01:31.884 --> 01:34.053
He began searching
the banks of the river

01:34.094 --> 01:35.679
looking for more dolls.

01:37.973 --> 01:41.018
Sometimes he would even sneak
to the mainland to find them.

01:48.984 --> 01:52.029
He hung these offerings
to her everywhere.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.616
[CHILDREN GIGGLING]

01:55.658 --> 01:59.870
For Don Julian, it seemed
that they pleased her spirit.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.456
As the dolls swayed in the wind,

02:02.498 --> 02:04.500
he believed she was playing with them.

02:06.585 --> 02:09.380
He believed they were
alive and protected him.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.676
As a father myself,

02:13.717 --> 02:16.846
I know that children can
grow tired of their toys.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.974
Maybe that's what Don Julian

02:20.015 --> 02:21.433
came to believe...

02:21.475 --> 02:23.185
That the spirit of the girl

02:23.227 --> 02:25.187
lost interest in her old dolls

02:25.229 --> 02:27.606
and wanted more and more new ones,

02:27.648 --> 02:32.611
dolls that, as he aged,
he had trouble providing.

02:32.653 --> 02:36.115
For the old man, the banks of
the river became treacherous.

02:37.992 --> 02:41.620
But still he had to
feed the spirit's hunger

02:41.662 --> 02:46.125
until one day he may have
sought out one doll too many.

02:48.961 --> 02:52.548
Don Julian was found drowned
in the same dark water

02:52.590 --> 02:53.966
where he'd discovered the girl

02:54.008 --> 02:55.968
all those years before.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.845
To this day,

02:57.887 --> 03:00.306
there are more than 1,500 dolls

03:28.000 --> 03:31.295
a guardian or the companion

03:31.337 --> 03:33.547

03:38.594 --> 03:40.971
MAHNKE: A toy we can't live without.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.642
A trusted friend...

03:45.809 --> 03:47.186
a confidant.

03:49.313 --> 03:50.898
Yet it's not uncommon

03:50.940 --> 03:54.526
for people to feel uneasy around dolls.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.279
Those glass eyes almost seem

03:57.321 --> 03:59.782
like they're staring right back at us...

03:59.823 --> 04:02.201
[WHIMPERING]

04:02.242 --> 04:05.412
which, is something we
can blame our brains for.

04:05.454 --> 04:08.457
They're hardwired to recognize faces.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.961
But it doesn't always work out.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.838
There's a concept in psychology

04:14.880 --> 04:16.714
known as the uncanny valley,

04:16.757 --> 04:20.010
where our minds instinctively
reject human look-alikes

04:20.052 --> 04:24.181
that are almost but not
quite perfectly accurate.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.684
It has a way of setting off alarms

04:26.725 --> 04:28.519
within our basic instincts.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.648
Despite that, we're
still all too willing

04:32.690 --> 04:35.943
to project humanity upon objects,

04:35.985 --> 04:39.029
and in doing so, we give them control.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.366
DOLL: I love you.

04:42.408 --> 04:44.952
But that's a dangerous game to play

04:44.994 --> 04:49.456
because sometimes, it seems,
they refuse to give it back.

05:00.926 --> 05:04.596
Thomas and Minnie Otto were
natives of Key West, Florida,

05:04.638 --> 05:08.183
and in 1898, they completed
building a new home,

05:08.225 --> 05:10.269
nestled there on Eaton Street.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.316
They were a well-off
and well-traveled couple

05:16.358 --> 05:18.861
who had a deep love for the arts.

05:18.902 --> 05:23.282
And they had a young son
named Robert Eugene Otto.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.618
But everyone called him Gene.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.495
Gene was quiet.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.248
Some might say he was an odd child.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.833
He kept to himself,

05:32.875 --> 05:35.377
and it was hard for
Gene to make friends.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.421
- THOMAS: ...the fingers.
- MINNIE: So delicate.

05:37.463 --> 05:38.380
Gene!

Never touch the art, Gene.

Do you understand me? Never touch it.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.887
You have your own
toys. Go play with them.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.360
A gift was mailed to Gene
by Thomas' aunt Bridget,

06:00.402 --> 06:02.780
who was traveling overseas.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.908
While in Germany,

06:05.949 --> 06:07.743
Aunt Bridget found the perfect present

06:07.785 --> 06:09.578
for her great-nephew.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.955
It had been a window display

06:11.997 --> 06:13.582
and was larger than most dolls.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.962
"Met this little sailor in
a store window in Germany."

06:20.589 --> 06:22.508
"He said he'd be a good friend to Gene."

06:30.808 --> 06:34.728
The doll had an immediate hold on Gene.

06:34.770 --> 06:38.023
He even named it AFTER HIMSELF: Robert.

Robert the doll.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.831
Gene, take the doll away from the table.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.173

likes the food we serve.

Well, that's the best
news we've had so far.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.443
There was no doubt

that Charlie had the upper hand.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.405
That's what made them so popular.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.323
But if you think about it,

12:20.365 --> 12:24.536
ventriloquism can also be
a little bit unsettling.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.413

12:26.455 --> 12:29.374
Audiences in 19th
century Europe and America

12:29.416 --> 12:32.043
were entertained but also unnerved

12:32.085 --> 12:34.296
by how a ventriloquist could give life

12:34.337 --> 12:36.006
to an inanimate object.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.804
So it wasn't surprising
that, for centuries,

12:42.846 --> 12:45.640
they were suspected of
meddling with dark forces.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.435
Some were even persecuted as witches.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.647
Others were thought to be

12:52.689 --> 12:54.608
channeling the voices of the dead.

up show business, doesn't it?

13:29.935 --> 13:32.270
It wasn't until many years later

13:32.312 --> 13:34.147
that Edgar's daughter provided

13:34.189 --> 13:37.442
disturbing details from her childhood...

13:37.484 --> 13:39.486
stories of how Edgar seemed

13:39.528 --> 13:42.322
to treat Charlie as her real sibling.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.703
How Charlie was given a
bedroom in the family home,

13:48.745 --> 13:51.665
a room that was larger than her own.

13:55.293 --> 13:58.588
And how, when Edgar died in 1978,

13:58.630 --> 14:00.549
he left her nothing

14:00.590 --> 14:03.677
and $10,000 for the care of Charlie.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.224
For what it's worth,
that bizarre relationship

14:09.266 --> 14:11.142
did nothing to keep Edgar's daughter

14:11.184 --> 14:14.145
from pursuing her own
career in entertainment.

to see his favorite aunt,

as am I.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.846
You've always had a talent

14:47.887 --> 14:49.264
for artificial politeness, dear.

14:49.306 --> 14:52.017
I never had the stamina for it myself.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.811
You know full well why it is I am here.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.855
When I sent that doll,

14:56.896 --> 14:59.941
I hoped it would become
a companion to Gene

14:59.983 --> 15:02.193
until he can find a real friend.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.612
But it is clear

15:03.653 --> 15:05.363
that his relationship with that doll

15:05.405 --> 15:07.907

34:07.504 --> 34:10.716
that someday his dolls
would come back to life

34:10.757 --> 34:12.342
and be his friends.

36:15.757 --> 36:16.758
[GASP]

36:20.304 --> 36:22.306
I managed to convince Robert

36:22.347 --> 36:25.017
to forgive you for last
night's indiscretion.

36:26.894 --> 36:29.104
Now sit.

36:51.293 --> 36:55.005
Robert spent the next several
decades in the Otto home.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.887
Over the years, neighbors would claim

37:01.929 --> 37:04.264
to see Robert looking out the window.

37:05.849 --> 37:08.393
He gained a reputation,

37:08.435 --> 37:10.729
one that outlived Gene.

37:16.526 --> 37:19.071
WOMAN: Hey, guys. Really
excited to be here today.

37:19.112 --> 37:22.115
I'm standing in front of
the Robert the Doll house.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.117
And up the top there,

37:24.159 --> 37:25.869
that, you can see the little attic.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.871
That's where they kept Robert.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.873
The attic is where

37:29.915 --> 37:32.834
the next owners of the Otto
house encountered Robert.

37:32.876 --> 37:36.880
They too, it seems, were
haunted by his presence.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.800
They chose to send Robert away,

37:39.841 --> 37:42.886
donating him to a museum in Key West.

37:45.847 --> 37:48.850
I'm looking for Robert the Doll.

37:48.892 --> 37:51.895
The haunted urban
legend of Robert the Doll

37:51.937 --> 37:53.647
lies in this museum.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.483
People come here

37:56.525 --> 37:58.443
on a kind of pilgrimage.

37:58.485 --> 37:59.736
They love to write letters

37:59.778 --> 38:01.655
and take pictures of Robert.

38:01.697 --> 38:04.199
And if you go, you may
want to do the same.

38:04.241 --> 38:07.536
But before you do, there's
something you should know.

38:07.577 --> 38:10.872
I'm standing in the
East Martello Museum,

38:10.914 --> 38:14.126
and right out of frame
is Robert the Doll,

38:14.167 --> 38:16.878
but you can't photograph him
without asking permission,

38:16.920 --> 38:20.007
so I'm gonna try and
give it a shot here.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.175
Just get me asking permission.

38:22.217 --> 38:27.014
Can we please take your
photo, Robert the Doll?

38:29.683 --> 38:32.602
They say if you don't
get his permission,

38:32.644 --> 38:37.024
Robert will get angry
and do bad things to you.

38:58.962 --> 39:01.882
Robert remains in the
museum to this day,

39:01.923 --> 39:06.094
not nailed into a
crate but behind glass.

39:07.763 --> 39:10.390
He continues to haunt us.

39:10.432 --> 39:14.019
It's his story that
gives him that power.

39:14.061 --> 39:17.856
It's believing in him
that keeps him alive.
