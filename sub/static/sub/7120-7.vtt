00:10.080 --> 00:11.393
You got that cooler, buddy?

00:11.444 --> 00:11.838
Yup!

00:12.200 --> 00:13.913
Good, 'cause we're gonna need it for this...

00:14.081 --> 00:15.968
ROOF PARTY!

00:17.025 --> 00:21.106
Watch this, everybody!
Triple flip with chips for the dip!

00:21.219 --> 00:23.687
Watch this, everybody! A cooler!

00:23.869 --> 00:25.925
With stuff... For the thing!

00:31.725 --> 00:38.429
Finn, you always focus an endless amount
of energy on everything you do.

00:38.513 --> 00:42.275
What about me? What do I focus
my energy on, Cinnamon Bun?

00:42.361 --> 00:46.711
Uh, Jake... you don't
really focus at all.

00:47.637 --> 00:48.206
Huh?

00:48.343 --> 00:50.988
I said you don't FOCUS AT ALL!

00:51.299 --> 00:53.187
Hey, Finn, do another flip.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.662
YUP! YAH!

00:54.706 --> 00:57.868
Hahaha!! You're a dynamo, Finn!!

00:57.924 --> 01:00.599
YEAH!! I NEVER SLOW DOWN!!

01:00.799 --> 01:02.774
"Never slow down?"

01:02.863 --> 01:04.806
Whoa. Dude, can you,
like, get offa' me?

01:05.531 --> 01:08.919
Do you think your energy could be
used to power a huge machine?

01:08.980 --> 01:10.006
I guess so, man.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.331
(Chuckles deviously)

01:17.663 --> 01:18.213
Hey, Jake.

01:19.243 --> 01:21.075
Your friend is super weird, dude.

01:24.574 --> 01:25.943
I thought he was your friend.

01:26.335 --> 01:29.473

Oh, yeah, right.

01:58.351 --> 01:59.189
(Yawns)

02:00.012 --> 02:01.287
Goodnight, homie.

02:30.495 --> 02:31.045
Finn?

02:33.182 --> 02:33.794
Hmm.

02:34.451 --> 02:35.814
Hmmmmm.

02:36.107 --> 02:37.208
Where is Finn?

02:37.870 --> 02:39.932
Where... is... Finn?

02:40.138 --> 02:42.225
Is he in the kitchen?

02:42.320 --> 02:44.070
Does he have a pumpkin?

02:44.132 --> 02:45.913
Bima-tima tin tin!

02:45.931 --> 02:47.675
Dooba-dooba dumplin'!

02:47.720 --> 02:49.345
Poopy-doopy pie tin!

02:49.364 --> 02:51.101
Monkey watermelon!

02:53.474 --> 02:54.992
-Welcome, Finn.
-Huh?

02:57.600 --> 03:00.319
UNTIE ME SO I CAN BEAT
YOU WITH THAT SACK!!

03:01.158 --> 03:01.788
(Gasp)

03:02.108 --> 03:02.807
You're that—

03:02.833 --> 03:05.338
Yes, the charismatic stranger from last night!

03:05.713 --> 03:06.369
Also...

03:06.381 --> 03:08.507
The Grand Master of the Gnomes!

03:08.857 --> 03:10.014
Hup! Hup! Hup!

03:10.413 --> 03:13.944
And... Ruler of the Beneathaverse!

03:14.889 --> 03:18.207
'S pretty nice. Hey, why don't
you guys just untie me,

03:18.226 --> 03:20.957
and we can pretend this whole thing didn't happen?

03:21.413 --> 03:25.731
Oh, no! I've been searching all
 over Ooo for the perfect power source!

03:25.914 --> 03:27.776
A living dynamo! Something that...

03:28.107 --> 03:29.457
... Never slows down.

03:29.870 --> 03:30.595
Uh-oh.

03:30.620 --> 03:32.670
And last night, I finally found—

03:32.251 --> 03:33.370
It's me.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.626
Yes!! It's you!!

03:35.264 --> 03:39.126
You will have the great honor of 
powering the Upturnoverdrive!

03:39.257 --> 03:40.369
That does what now?

03:40.376 --> 03:42.501
It will flip over the entire world!

03:42.533 --> 03:44.820
Then we'll be the ones 
on top, honey!

03:44.889 --> 03:46.264
THAT'S BIZONKERS!

03:46.581 --> 03:49.444
Yes, but the engineering 
is very sound.

03:50.470 --> 03:51.108
Huh?

03:51.300 --> 03:55.031
Your energies will be harnessed by 
our most advanced technology.

03:55.464 --> 03:58.269
The Cyclonic Roticerod!

03:58.320 --> 04:00.326
Ha! You may have captured me...

04:00.969 --> 04:02.644
...but you can't make me run!

04:02.669 --> 04:03.176
Ow!

04:04.332 --> 04:06.745
Well... you can't make 
me run very fast.

04:07.945 --> 04:10.307
Jake's on his way to mess you guys-

04:10.319 --> 04:11.362

04:33.539 --> 04:35.213
A dancing bug!

04:38.372 --> 04:40.841
Hey, man, you're shakin' it all wrong!

04:40.879 --> 04:42.841
But shakin' it's all I know!

04:42.886 --> 04:47.416

04:53.217 --> 04:57.073
Aw, yeah! Huh-hah! Yeah! Whoo!

04:58.186 --> 05:02.217
Congratulations. You fully charged 
the alternator!

05:02.266 --> 05:05.085
Now it's time to power up the Plasma Ball!

05:05.242 --> 05:06.541
With sexy-fun dancing!

05:06.572 --> 05:08.928
NO! STOP! NOOOOO!!!!

05:08.954 --> 05:09.917
WHA! AAH!!

05:09.986 --> 05:11.086
(Screams)

05:12.467 --> 05:13.217
(Music plays)

05:26.941 --> 05:31.266
Chug! Chug! Chug! 
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

05:32.360 --> 05:33.297
Whooooo!

05:36.198 --> 05:37.055
Whoooo!

05:37.171 --> 05:39.161
Any more grass shakes, Simon?

05:39.192 --> 05:39.973
All finished.

05:40.042 --> 05:42.211
Finished, huh? (Exhales)

05:44.016 --> 05:46.198
Finished... Finished...

05:46.867 --> 05:48.654
Fin... Finn...

05:48.773 --> 05:50.449
AWWW, FINN!

05:50.580 --> 05:55.317
Darn it! My best friend's missing! 
I gotta get my head together!

05:55.428 --> 05:56.622
Get undistracted!

05:56.735 --> 05:59.297
And use alla' my skills to track 'im down!

05:59.455 --> 06:00.349
Smelling!

06:02.148 --> 06:03.017
Touching.

06:03.792 --> 06:04.730
Tasting.

06:05.423 --> 06:06.360
Looking.

06:06.404 --> 06:06.973
(Gasp)

06:07.123 --> 06:10.179
Little footprints! Too 
small to be Finn's...

06:10.667 --> 06:13.561
More like a bunch-a'-gnomes-
carrying-something footprints!

06:13.592 --> 06:14.430
(Laughing)

06:15.210 --> 06:18.010
Okay. I've got a joke.

06:18.436 --> 06:22.780
What did the mermaid... sea? A movie?

06:23.274 --> 06:24.036
Wh-...What?

06:24.436 --> 06:28.586
Oh! I messed it up! 
But it's still funny, right?

06:28.673 --> 06:31.523
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, NO, IT'S NOT!!

06:31.635 --> 06:33.698
Y'all are horrible at tellin' jokes.

06:33.830 --> 06:35.055
Lemme hitcha with this.

06:35.272 --> 06:38.835
Didya hear about the goblin who 
got his left arm and left leg cut off?

06:39.186 --> 06:40.942
Um... No...

06:41.023 --> 06:43.591
That's okay! He's al-right now!!

06:44.617 --> 06:46.192
AH-HAHAHAHA!

06:46.311 --> 06:47.649

Wha?!

06:57.504 --> 06:58.429
AAAAH!!

06:58.710 --> 07:00.741
Now... for the final stage!

07:01.004 --> 07:02.460
The brain machine!!

07:02.961 --> 07:03.811
No!

07:03.874 --> 07:07.842
YES! THIS MACHINE WILL SUCK 
THE ENERGY FROM YOUR THOUGHTS!

07:08.241 --> 07:10.598
...To start our Upturnoverdrive.

07:12.774 --> 07:13.749
Don't think, Finn...

07:14.173 --> 07:15.323
Don't think anything.

07:15.873 --> 07:18.861
Can't... let... them...

07:18.899 --> 07:19.880
... WIN!!

07:20.580 --> 07:21.105
JYAH!!

07:21.702 --> 07:22.659
WOH! YAH!

08:05.659 --> 08:08.002
Your party is nuts!

08:08.127 --> 08:09.789
How'd I even get up here?!

08:09.814 --> 08:13.389
You blacked out after laughing 
so hard at your own jokes.

08:13.715 --> 08:15.271
You were off the hook!

08:15.408 --> 08:18.233
So we took you to the Cloud Kingdom...

08:18.259 --> 08:20.790
to party with the Party God.

08:20.844 --> 08:23.532
Whoa! Who's the Party God?!

08:23.796 --> 08:26.321
I am the Party God!

08:26.559 --> 08:27.346
...Oh.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.714
Jake... you have won my favor-

08:29.727 --> 08:32.802
for being a completely 
off-the-hook party dog!

08:32.845 --> 08:34.070
(Howls)

08:34.289 --> 08:35.109
Hahaha!

08:35.284 --> 08:38.427
And because your gut 
waves please me so,

08:38.645 --> 08:41.025
I will grant you one wish!

08:41.546 --> 08:44.496
What do you want most in the world?

08:44.609 --> 08:46.640
"What do I want most?"

08:48.071 --> 08:50.364
...What do I want most in the world?

08:51.151 --> 08:53.783
Well... I wish Finn would 
stop leavin' his dirty—

08:53.802 --> 08:54.158

I will have to fill you with the energy 
of a thousand partying demons!

09:26.652 --> 09:30.315
