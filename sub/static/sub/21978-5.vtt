01:17.807 --> 01:20.319
Oh, man, I feel like such a geek.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.444
Like, how come, dude ?

01:22.944 --> 01:24.442
You look totally gnarly to me.

01:25.405 --> 01:28.014
Next time, I'll come up
with our disguises.

01:28.439 --> 01:30.759
Hey, this new zarnovameter
really works !

01:31.726 --> 01:33.612
The last fragment
of the eye of Zarnov.

01:34.249 --> 01:35.675
It's this way. Come on !

01:49.152 --> 01:50.716
Well, did you find it ?

01:51.083 --> 01:53.426
My calculations were correct.

01:53.990 --> 01:56.261
The third fragment
did land in the river,

01:56.830 --> 01:58.118
and I recovered it.

02:01.709 --> 02:04.747
This ?
You incompetent maggot !

02:05.265 --> 02:06.422
This is a fish !

02:06.765 --> 02:09.413
Sorry, master Shredder.
He beat me to it.

02:11.598 --> 02:14.565
I tried to warn you.
He's one mean mackerel.

02:15.171 --> 02:16.419
Never mind that.

02:17.759 --> 02:20.646
The important thing is,
we have the final fragment.

02:21.003 --> 02:23.565
The fragment's moved out
of range. We've lost it !

02:24.108 --> 02:26.076
I'll bet Shredder's already found it.

02:26.485 --> 02:28.133
Then we've got to find him.

02:28.507 --> 02:29.810
That's for sure.

02:30.088 --> 02:32.236
If he puts all 3 fragments together,

02:32.738 --> 02:34.611
We're talking mondo disaster.

02:37.133 --> 02:39.789
Now we can possess
the unimaginable power

02:40.180 --> 02:42.172
Of the entire eye of Zarnov !

02:43.404 --> 02:45.922
Correction, Baxter.
I will possess it.

02:46.216 --> 02:48.210
You will go get lunch.

02:49.198 --> 02:53.576
Just wait. One of these days,
the tables will turn.

02:56.696 --> 02:58.929
Astounding, Shredder.

02:59.335 --> 03:02.406
You're finally putting
the eye back together.

03:03.125 --> 03:05.956
For once, you didn't foul up.

03:06.571 --> 03:09.379
But now what will you do ?

03:09.785 --> 03:11.848
Attach it to my helmet, Krang,

03:12.265 --> 03:15.374
So that I can control its awesome
abilities Through sheer thought

03:15.763 --> 03:18.821
And use that power
to first rid myself

03:19.363 --> 03:21.906
of those blasted turtles
once and for all !

03:22.364 --> 03:25.312
Wait. I sense that
Shredder is very near.

03:26.138 --> 03:28.083
Hey, that gizmo
really does work !

03:28.354 --> 03:30.524
That's not why.
Look !

03:31.038 --> 03:32.489
If Shredder does have the eye,

03:33.045 --> 03:35.311
Baxter will lead us right to him.

03:36.094 --> 03:38.119
He spotted us.

03:40.441 --> 03:42.533
Holy guacamole !

03:43.298 --> 03:45.727
Look ! It's them Teenage
mutant Ninja Turtles !

03:46.289 --> 03:48.054
Those shellbacks are fugitives !

03:48.413 --> 03:51.063
I'll bet we can collect
a reward for nabbing 'em !

03:52.451 --> 03:53.907
Battle stances, guys !

03:54.418 --> 03:56.291
Looks like we've got
a fight on our hands !

03:56.713 --> 03:57.637
I'm ready for you, dudes.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.500
Cowabunga !

04:25.603 --> 04:27.977
Too bad there isn't
a reward for these guys.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.518
Yeah. We could have made
a net profit.

04:31.001 --> 04:34.375
Enough with the comedy.

04:34.826 --> 04:36.103
We've lost Baxter.

04:36.495 --> 04:38.580
Now how are we gonna
find Shredder ?

04:38.971 --> 04:41.127
Jackpot ! There's our answer !

04:43.341 --> 04:45.101
But beware, Shredder.

04:45.478 --> 04:48.503
The power of the eye
has one limitation.

04:49.347 --> 04:51.456
You don't know what it can do.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.151
I assure you, Krang,

04:53.822 --> 04:56.786
Not even that can prevent the
turtles complete destruction.

04:57.242 --> 04:59.704
Self-confident sort of
super villain, isn't he ?

05:00.002 --> 05:02.682
You would be, too, if you had this !

05:06.708 --> 05:08.303
The eye of Zarnov !

05:08.883 --> 05:12.234
Indeed ! And did you know
it can transmute matter ?

05:12.638 --> 05:18.067
With it, I can transform any
substance into any form I wish !

05:23.577 --> 05:27.396
Ice cream cones ?!

05:27.786 --> 05:30.701
And whatever I create, I can control !

05:31.745 --> 05:33.245
Sic 'em !

05:42.092 --> 05:44.366
This is, like, totally bogus.

05:46.441 --> 05:48.458
Grab on, Michelangelo !

05:50.356 --> 05:54.103
We've got to stop this
creature before it escapes !

05:57.238 --> 05:59.161
Mondo notion, dude !

05:59.565 --> 06:02.041
Shredder, if that thing
hurts our buddies,

06:02.514 --> 06:04.024
you are history !

06:04.461 --> 06:07.270
Wrong, mutants ! I'm
about to make history !

06:07.643 --> 06:10.059
Too bad you won't
be around to see it.

06:14.882 --> 06:15.816
Look !

06:16.144 --> 06:18.235
What in the world is that thing ?

06:20.138 --> 06:23.539
It looks like a flying dragon
with 2 turtles on its back.

06:23.977 --> 06:26.661
Well, whatever it is, it's
a story ! Let's follow it !

06:27.219 --> 06:31.779
A-are you sure you want t-t-to g-g-go
after that th-thing, miss O'Neill ?

06:32.155 --> 06:34.648
Blodgett, yours is not
to question why.

06:34.993 --> 06:39.113
- Yours is but to drive...
- And... crash.

06:41.431 --> 06:45.474
Now remember, Blodgett, just sit
here until we're ready to leave.

06:45.836 --> 06:47.970
Y-y-yes, sir. Yes, sir.

06:49.044 --> 06:53.100
We've got to do something before
the whole city goes up in flames.

06:53.931 --> 06:56.737
Hey, no problemo. 

07:01.525 --> 07:03.131
Great work, Michelangelo !

07:03.433 --> 07:05.642
Now climb up here next to me !

07:07.160 --> 07:10.838
Oh, great. The weight is too
much with both of us on its back.

07:11.542 --> 07:13.026
Oh ! Oh me, oh my !

07:15.850 --> 07:18.686
Blodgett, come back here,
you coward !

07:20.603 --> 07:25.005
Cowabunga ! This ride
is a definite "e" ticket.

07:27.174 --> 07:28.316
Give it up, Shredder !

07:28.781 --> 07:31.699
Come and get it,
you genetic accidents !

07:34.892 --> 07:37.220
That helmet. We've got
to get it off him !

07:37.548 --> 07:40.368
Don't look at me ! You're
the one with the weapon !

07:43.138 --> 07:45.173
Now ! While he's distracted !

07:45.617 --> 07:46.987
Gotcha !

07:49.722 --> 07:52.684
Hey, what's happening ?
We're falling !

07:53.367 --> 07:57.544
All of a sudden, that
dragon doesn't seem so bad !

08:07.341 --> 08:09.939
Well, what do you know ?
Surf's up !

08:11.740 --> 08:15.160
Oh, dear. I wonder
where that dragon went.

08:20.354 --> 08:22.052
Mommy !

08:26.222 --> 08:29.199
Blodgett, just look at the news van !

08:29.624 --> 08:31.958
I'm sorry, mr. Vernon.

08:32.395 --> 08:34.706
You'll be even sorrier
when you hear this.

08:35.096 --> 08:37.361
Blodgett, you're fired !

08:38.150 --> 08:41.568
Oh, boy. Somehow
this always happens.

08:43.288 --> 08:46.094
No trace of Shredder or Baxter.

08:46.762 --> 08:48.448
Or the zarnovameter.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.537
I guess i must have
Dropped it.

08:50.911 --> 08:51.836
What's that ?

08:52.599 --> 08:54.008
The boys in blue.

08:54.474 --> 08:56.111
No wonder
Shredder split.

08:56.579 --> 08:59.419
And we should too. We can't
let the Police find us here.

08:59.871 --> 09:02.471
Yeah. Blue doesn't go
Too well with green.

09:06.484 --> 09:09.476
that was the fourth
Job i've lost this year.

09:10.696 --> 09:13.644
Oh, mortimer.
Whatever am i gonna do ?

09:16.527 --> 09:19.730
how to fix
your messed up life.

09:20.225 --> 09:21.347
Forget it,
Mortimer.

09:21.833 --> 09:24.452
Nothing ever works for me,
Not even these.

09:27.729 --> 09:29.756
Well, if you insist.

09:33.253 --> 09:37.060
Yes. You too can achieve
your Dream of a better life

09:37.759 --> 09:40.322
Through the power
Of positive wishing.

09:40.803 --> 09:43.409
Do you yearn to own
A luxury limousine ?

09:43.754 --> 09:48.342
It can be yours if you
Simply put your mind to it.

09:52.127 --> 09:53.580
It--it works !

09:53.953 --> 09:56.526
And to think i was about
To return these tapes

09:57.077 --> 09:59.210
And ask for my money back.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.080
Obviously you fell
Out of the sky Because

10:02.612 --> 10:05.593
Shredder could not Sustain
his mentally Created dragon

10:06.168 --> 10:07.604
Without the helmet.

10:08.101 --> 10:09.770
And since he failed
To destroy you,

10:10.301 --> 10:12.407
You'll be doubly
Eager to reclaim it.

10:12.739 --> 10:14.794
The really negative news
Is that we've lost The

10:15.246 --> 10:19.540
And if shredder finds That thing
and figures Out what it is,

10:19.823 --> 10:21.816
He'll for sure beat us
To the helmet.

10:22.193 --> 10:25.450
Which is why you Must start
looking For it immediately.

10:25.963 --> 10:27.653
Hey, even if we don't
Find it,

10:28.179 --> 10:30.800
At least our disguises
Won't be a total loss.

10:31.176 --> 10:32.500
Hold it, michelangelo.

10:32.895 --> 10:34.574
What's with you, bud ?

10:34.995 --> 10:37.103
Don't eat the props.

10:39.356 --> 10:43.110
Those blasted turtles ! Because
of them, I've lost the helmet !

10:43.576 --> 10:46.308
I think i have the Solution
to your Problem, master,

10:46.714 --> 10:50.143
Not now. If krang
Finds out about this--

10:50.524 --> 10:51.438
But master, i--

10:51.719 --> 10:53.594
I said silence,
You blithering fool !

10:53.969 --> 10:55.654
I'm thinking !
I can't be bothered

10:55.965 --> 10:58.037
With your ridiculous
Toys at a time Like this !

10:58.476 --> 11:00.113
Ridiculous toys, hmm ?

11:00.820 --> 11:04.316
Now stop wasting my time With
those idiotic Inventions of yours !

11:04.652 --> 11:07.263
Baxter ! Baxter,
Where are you ?

11:07.618 --> 11:09.191
Baxter !

11:10.876 --> 11:12.363
Egomaniacal ingrate !

11:12.858 --> 11:14.980
If he only listened,
He would have learned

11:15.353 --> 11:18.317
That this tracking device
Can hone in on the eye.

11:18.835 --> 11:21.866
But i'll show him !
I'll find the eye myself

11:22.329 --> 11:26.775
And make him sorry he Ever mocked
the brilliance Of baxter stockman !

11:28.067 --> 11:30.740
Where am i gonna put My
fabulous comic book Collection

11:31.131 --> 11:32.532
Once it's completed ?

11:35.245 --> 11:36.697
Mommy !

11:38.911 --> 11:42.409
Wait a minute.
I thought of a limousine

11:42.749 --> 11:44.780
And my sofa turned into one.

11:45.136 --> 11:49.081
Then i thought of comic
Books. It's this helmet !

11:49.455 --> 11:52.017
It turns objects into
Anything i want !

11:52.315 --> 11:54.634
Why, i don't need a job.

11:55.058 --> 11:56.584
I can create money !

11:56.974 --> 12:01.580
For instance, i could Turn this
gold watch Into lots of gold.

12:01.935 --> 12:03.480
Piles and piles of gold !

12:04.745 --> 12:07.460
It didn't work.
I wonder why not ?

12:07.863 --> 12:09.704
Because you're an idiot,
That's why !

12:10.628 --> 12:13.299
Which is why you don't
Deserve that helmet !

12:20.046 --> 12:21.252
But i do !

12:27.868 --> 12:32.823
I'll make the world pay For not
recognizing the Genius of baxter stockman !

12:35.914 --> 12:38.994
Now that i have the helmet,
I don't need this anymore.

12:43.574 --> 12:48.911
The perfect place To build an
edifice That reflects my genius.

12:49.895 --> 12:53.322
3 hours of searching And
still no sign Of that helmet.

12:53.718 --> 12:55.899
Face it, guys. Without
The zarnovameter,

12:56.226 --> 12:57.803
It's needle
In a haystack time.

12:58.252 --> 13:01.685
A man of my genius Deserves
magnificent Quarters !

13:02.064 --> 13:03.341
A palace !

13:04.727 --> 13:07.502
A veritable taj mahal !

13:13.805 --> 13:15.605
Totally awesome !

13:16.302 --> 13:18.897
Looks like Somebody's
already Found the helmet !

13:19.171 --> 13:20.518
Let's find out !

13:22.026 --> 13:23.482
Baxter Stockman ?!

13:23.778 --> 13:26.071
I was wondering how Long it
would take You to show up,

13:26.633 --> 13:29.719
And i promise you'll
Be sorry you did !

13:29.988 --> 13:31.609
Watch this !

13:37.147 --> 13:40.217
Meet my personal chef.

13:42.324 --> 13:46.021
Make me some... [smacks
lips] Turtle soup !

13:46.398 --> 13:47.661
Now !

14:03.570 --> 14:05.740
That's it,
Mortimer ! Hurry !

14:06.054 --> 14:08.225
I must get that
Helmet back.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.474
He had this gadget with
Him when he showed up.

14:19.048 --> 14:21.650
Huh...it looks like some
Sort of geiger counter.

14:22.233 --> 14:23.711
If it led him
To the helmet,

14:24.427 --> 14:26.116
It could do
The same for me !

14:29.097 --> 14:31.088
Man, that thing's
Humongous !

14:31.930 --> 14:34.823
Glob
Approaching at 4:00 !

14:38.517 --> 14:40.750
Guys, don't let
That stuff touch you !

14:41.543 --> 14:43.007
It could be deadly !

14:43.648 --> 14:45.238
Yeah, don't
Sweat it, dudes !

14:45.643 --> 14:48.660
These 'chucks will Take care
of this Walking glue factory.

14:51.430 --> 14:51.773
Wha-- ?!

14:52.728 --> 14:53.912
Oh...maybe not.

14:54.274 --> 14:56.827
Don't panic, michelangelo !
I'll set you free !

14:58.033 --> 14:59.873
Gosh ! You're
A regular abe lincoln !

15:14.363 --> 15:15.696
I gotcha, donatello !

15:16.002 --> 15:17.797
Somebody tell him that.

15:20.733 --> 15:23.520
Surrender, turtles,
And i might spare you

15:24.163 --> 15:26.642
If you admit that i,
Baxter stockman,

15:27.031 --> 15:29.057
Have accomplished
What shredder could not.

15:29.542 --> 15:32.739
I'll bear that in Mind, baxter,
when i Deliver your eulogy,

15:33.216 --> 15:34.471
You traitorous vermin !

15:34.880 --> 15:38.389
Just a little bit more
And--uhh !--there.

15:38.730 --> 15:39.530
I got it.

15:39.854 --> 15:40.901
That's my helmet,

15:41.226 --> 15:43.271
And i shall destroy
The turtles for this power !

15:43.690 --> 15:45.409
Help ! I command you !

15:55.799 --> 15:56.892
What are you doing ?

15:57.219 --> 15:59.218
We'll need all the help
We can get !

15:59.495 --> 16:02.551
Get ready, baxter ! Ninja
Class is about to begin !

16:06.553 --> 16:10.244
No, my friend. You're the one
who's About to learn a lesson !

16:13.630 --> 16:16.485
Like we thought
We had trouble before.

16:19.469 --> 16:21.963
I'd hate to have
This guy's electric bill !

16:24.799 --> 16:27.122
We need some kind
Of insulator.

16:27.580 --> 16:30.464
The rug ! Come on, guys.
Give me a hand.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.050
So much for
Your blob monster !

16:42.539 --> 16:44.818
Give me back
My helmet !

16:45.240 --> 16:48.075
It's mine and
I came for it !

16:48.682 --> 16:49.681
Give it to me !

16:49.993 --> 16:51.723
Get away from me,
Wimp !

16:52.849 --> 16:54.985
So much for
Your blob monster !

16:55.374 --> 16:57.308
You won't have as much
Luck with this !

16:59.257 --> 17:02.331
That minaret--i'll turn
It into another monster !

17:03.775 --> 17:05.330
It's not working !

17:05.709 --> 17:08.337
So the eye does
Have a limitation !

17:08.667 --> 17:10.619
It has no effect on gold !

17:11.036 --> 17:13.006
Now, you miserable worm,

17:13.378 --> 17:15.012
You're going to pay !

17:25.453 --> 17:26.717
What the heck is this ?

17:27.010 --> 17:29.335
It's some kind of
Plastic bubble.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.237
And worst of all,
It's shrinking !

17:32.503 --> 17:36.015
Precisely. Soon it will
Crush the life from you,

17:36.340 --> 17:38.949
Leaving me free to begin
My conquest of earth !

17:39.883 --> 17:44.485
I'll start with The city by
destroying The interstate bridge !

17:48.587 --> 17:51.647
He's gone, and he Took
the zarnovameter With him !

17:52.206 --> 17:55.858
But if he's got both the
Zarnovameter and the eye,

17:56.497 --> 17:58.388
He's a walking time bomb !

18:03.795 --> 18:05.581
It's april
And splinter !

18:05.948 --> 18:08.478
They got the s.o.s. I
sent on the Communicator !

18:08.849 --> 18:11.269
Easy, guys. We'll Have you
out of There in a second...

18:11.631 --> 18:12.922
Won't we, splinter ?

18:13.358 --> 18:14.486
I will try.

18:23.331 --> 18:24.951
Oh me, oh my !

18:28.572 --> 18:30.865
Mr. Blodgett,
What are you doing here ?

18:31.316 --> 18:33.563
Well, it's a long story.

18:34.219 --> 18:36.345
Which we don't have
Time for now.

18:41.084 --> 18:43.263
I know the eye's
Weakness !

18:44.621 --> 18:46.836
It has no effect
On gold !

18:47.242 --> 18:49.550
Oh, great. Then all we
Have to do to beat him

18:49.867 --> 18:51.913
Is lure him to fort knox !

18:52.265 --> 18:53.997
Wait ! I just thought
Of something !

18:54.343 --> 18:56.196
The curator At the
museum of Natural history

18:56.494 --> 18:57.896
Is a friend of mine !

18:58.230 --> 18:58.959
So ?

18:59.488 --> 19:01.205
So here's my idea.

19:05.900 --> 19:08.614
Golden shields from
Ancient rome, huh ?

19:09.306 --> 19:11.161
And try not
To ding 'em, will you ?

19:11.411 --> 19:13.217
They have to go back to
The museum in the morning.

19:13.626 --> 19:15.806
Yo, gang ! I scoped
Out shredder !

19:16.180 --> 19:19.486
And he's created An army of
monsters To destroy the bridge !

19:19.819 --> 19:23.094
We've got to distract Them.
Donatello, Detach the glider.

19:27.755 --> 19:29.866
Raphael, deflate
The air bag !

19:40.953 --> 19:42.903
The turtles, alive ?!

19:47.426 --> 19:49.064
Let's do it, guys !

19:59.925 --> 20:01.749
Oh, it's mine now

20:02.095 --> 20:04.075
And no one can
Take it from me !

20:04.324 --> 20:07.519
Shredder, the zarnovameter
Is reaching critical mass !

20:07.800 --> 20:08.954
What ?!

20:09.191 --> 20:10.785
It was designed
To destroy the eye

20:11.045 --> 20:12.807
By triggering
A massive explosion

20:13.027 --> 20:14.608
When the two
Came in contact !

20:31.016 --> 20:32.173
Everyone all right ?

20:32.422 --> 20:34.433
We were brought up
In water, remember ?

20:34.757 --> 20:36.475
Shredder is...gone.

20:36.868 --> 20:39.410
You don't suppose he bit
The big one, do you ?

20:39.800 --> 20:41.091
No such luck.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.087
I have a feeling
He'll be back.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.399
And probably sooner
Than we think.

20:47.270 --> 20:50.783
And once again, our City was
saved by those Mysterious heroes

20:51.297 --> 20:52.779
The ninja turtles !

20:53.181 --> 20:55.715
Miss april, i can't
Thank you enough

20:56.114 --> 20:58.240
For getting mr. Vernon
To give me my job back.

20:58.817 --> 20:59.670
It was easy,

21:00.080 --> 21:01.878
Once i told him
How brave you were.

21:03.420 --> 21:05.148
I was brave, wasn't i ?

21:05.494 --> 21:06.660
You certainly were,

21:07.004 --> 21:09.017
Rescuing me from
That falling wall !

21:11.611 --> 21:13.557
Hey, let's celebrate,
Everyone !

21:13.962 --> 21:18.033
I'm taking all of you To the most
expensive Restaurant i can find !

21:18.422 --> 21:20.559
Oh, i forgot
To tell you,

21:21.080 --> 21:24.805
Vernon said the cost Of replacing
the news Van you wrecked

21:25.068 --> 21:26.742
Is coming out of
Your salary.

21:27.051 --> 21:28.238
It is ?

21:28.661 --> 21:31.434
Well, in that case,
Would you mind terribly

21:31.874 --> 21:33.263
If i just sent out
For pizza ?

21:33.523 --> 21:35.867
Pizza ! Yeah !
Terrific !

21:36.145 --> 21:38.610
Let's do it !
On the double !

21:39.305 --> 21:45.303
