00:02.263 --> 00:04.047
Previously onLegacies...

00:04.091 --> 00:05.396
ALARIC:
My daughter Josie

00:05.440 --> 00:07.268
is under the influence
of black magic.

00:07.311 --> 00:09.270
You said you came back here
for a reason.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.664
All right, Sister Satan,

00:12.708 --> 00:14.057
let's dance.

00:14.101 --> 00:17.017
...generis fiantus.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.545
Don't cry, Dad.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.069
One less mouth
to feed.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.984
ALARIC:
She thinks she won.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.290
Hope had a plan B.

00:29.333 --> 00:33.120
LIZZIE:
Hope's in Josie's mind?

00:33.163 --> 00:35.644
Let's use that dark magic
to raise and control

00:35.687 --> 00:36.949
Malivore himself.

00:36.993 --> 00:38.429
JOSIE:
If we raise him

00:38.473 --> 00:40.127
and he gets
his dirty hands on Landon...

00:40.170 --> 00:43.086
I have plans for Mr. Kirby.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.247
Well, this is unexpected.

01:18.948 --> 01:21.168
Josie?

01:22.647 --> 01:26.216
Your subconscious
is weirding me out.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.918
Literal bread crumbs.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.529
Subtle.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.588
Wait.
It's okay.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.329
You don't have to run.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.205
Post tenebras

01:58.248 --> 02:00.642
spero lucem.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.167
You don't have to hide, either.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.647
I'm not gonna hurt you.

02:07.692 --> 02:10.173
Would you shut your piehole,
lady?

02:10.217 --> 02:11.522
And put out
that light,

02:11.566 --> 02:13.872
before you get us both killed.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.014
Chad!

02:25.057 --> 02:26.755
Get the robes!

02:26.798 --> 02:30.280
We must have ceremony.

02:31.847 --> 02:35.024
With the phoenix vessel
no longer a threat to our plans,

02:35.067 --> 02:39.855
today's the day
we raise Malivore!

02:42.162 --> 02:43.206
Wha...

02:45.252 --> 02:46.992
What have you done

02:47.036 --> 02:48.255
to my crypt?

02:48.298 --> 02:51.997
Mm. Classing the place up a bit.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.782
Which means
no more robes.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.087
It's tacky.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.567
They're iconic.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.265
CHAD:
I was skeptical
at first, too.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.223
But... look.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.703
I think the
curtains really do

03:01.746 --> 03:03.226
tie the room together.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.880
Shut up, Chad.
You're out of your element.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.229
You were all supposed to be

03:06.273 --> 03:07.448
preparing
the pit.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.885
About that, I know that I said

03:09.928 --> 03:13.280
we'd raise Malivore
after the Merge was done.

03:13.323 --> 03:16.152
But if the Merge
was successful,

03:16.196 --> 03:18.415
I would have
absorbed my sister.

03:18.459 --> 03:21.288
And I can't feel her at all.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.290
So something's wrong.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.248
ALYSSA:
We're guessing it's Hope.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.729
It's always Hope.

03:27.772 --> 03:30.732
As urgentas that all seems,
witch,

03:30.775 --> 03:33.256
you're not the one
who decides what we do next.

03:35.345 --> 03:38.087
See, these are mypuppets.

03:55.409 --> 03:56.888
We...

03:56.932 --> 04:00.022
are gonna do what I say now.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.853
Is that clear

04:04.896 --> 04:08.422
or do I need
to make you nod?

04:10.424 --> 04:13.383
Your wish is my command.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.993
Mm.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.087
Get your zombie
eye to find out

04:22.131 --> 04:24.742
what really
happened to Lizzie.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.401
Back to work.

04:32.489 --> 04:35.405
LIZZIE:
I look so peaceful.

04:35.449 --> 04:38.321
Angelic, even.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.323
No wonder you had
a thing for me.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.543
That's not why I had
a thing for you.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.371
And why are you speaking
in the past tense?

04:44.414 --> 04:46.373
You're totally alive.That wreath
can't go there.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.765
That is where the doves
are being released,

04:47.809 --> 04:49.767
which is after the video,
remember?

04:49.811 --> 04:51.116
No.

04:51.160 --> 04:54.032
Lizzie,
this does not matter, okay?

04:54.076 --> 04:56.948
None of this is real.
It's just a show.

04:56.992 --> 05:00.778
A show to convince
Homicidal Hot Topic Josie

05:00.822 --> 05:02.389
that she actually killed me,

05:02.432 --> 05:04.695
so it better be
a damn good one.

05:04.739 --> 05:07.350
There's still so much
left to do.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.352
If you're trying to play dead,

05:09.396 --> 05:12.573
managing your own funeral
defeats the point.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.009
I'm way ahead of you there.

05:14.052 --> 05:17.621
That is what this
freakishly large ring is for.

05:23.279 --> 05:24.585
HOPE-LUSION:
I'm unique and special.

05:24.628 --> 05:28.458
And for some reason,
I'm really emo about it.

05:28.502 --> 05:31.331
Wait here while I go sacrifice
myself unnecessarily.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.855
How'd I do?

05:36.423 --> 05:38.207
What's going on here?Hey, Daddy.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.556
What is going on?

05:39.600 --> 05:42.385
I figured since we're disguising
Hope's body as me

05:42.429 --> 05:44.561
while she roots around
in Josie's subconscious,

05:44.605 --> 05:46.433
that I could pretend to be her
while she's gone.

05:46.476 --> 05:48.217
Oh...

05:48.260 --> 05:50.001
Wow, is she really
this short?

05:50.045 --> 05:52.090
Elizabeth?

05:52.134 --> 05:54.484
You need me to oversee
the funeral.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.400
Are we really gonna
roll with this?

05:57.444 --> 05:58.445
Like, this is gonna happen...

05:58.488 --> 05:59.794
Dad!
Mm.

05:59.837 --> 06:02.405
The emotion has to be real.

06:02.449 --> 06:06.627
And who better to put together
a touching memorial to me

06:06.670 --> 06:09.586
than... me?

06:09.630 --> 06:13.503
Uh, sweetie, I think
it's a great idea,

06:13.547 --> 06:16.463
but I just-- I think
people are gonna...

06:16.506 --> 06:18.421
figure it out.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.596
JED:
Yeah, he's right.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.556
The pack's never gonna
fall for this.

06:23.731 --> 06:27.865
Ahem. Hello there...

06:27.909 --> 06:29.606
fellow wolves.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.478
So nice to see you again,

06:31.521 --> 06:35.612
Piper, Trevor, Brock.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.049
BROCK:
Yo. We're gonna build
a human pyramid

06:38.093 --> 06:39.616
after the funeral,
if you want to join.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.445
I'd love to.
And then maybe after we could

06:42.489 --> 06:45.666
run around outside

06:45.709 --> 06:48.016
and stare at the moon
for awhile.BROCK: Nice.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.626
Yo, you rock, Hope.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.976
Back atcha, Brockmeister.

06:58.287 --> 07:01.029
The defense rests.

07:01.072 --> 07:04.946
Fine. But no doves.

07:06.382 --> 07:08.471
All right, you heard the man.

07:08.515 --> 07:09.864
We've got work to do.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.564
Dr. Saltzman.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.135
I need your help.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.006
Okay.

07:23.225 --> 07:24.835
HOPE:
Hey, would you wait up?

07:24.879 --> 07:26.141
PIG:
Take your "innocent girl
with the basket" act

07:26.184 --> 07:27.708
someplace else.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.840
Last thing I need is
some trigger-happy skirt

07:29.884 --> 07:31.146
doing magic near me.

07:31.189 --> 07:32.713
Why? What happens
if I do magic?

07:32.756 --> 07:34.715
Don't find out!

07:35.716 --> 07:37.195
And quit following me.

07:37.239 --> 07:38.719
You don't belong here, toots.

07:38.762 --> 07:41.548
Sexist talking pigs
aren't really my thing.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.680
I'd love to leave, but
I'm not going anywhere

07:43.724 --> 07:44.768
until I find my friend Josie.

07:46.944 --> 07:48.511
What do you want with her?

07:48.555 --> 07:51.122
I came to rescue her.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.516
Yeah, well, you're too late
for that.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.605
What do you mean?

07:57.607 --> 07:59.609
Pull up a stump.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.180
Once upon a time,

08:05.223 --> 08:07.704
this was a beautiful land.

08:07.748 --> 08:11.534
A peaceful kingdom,
ruled by Princess Josette.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.104
And then the Darkness came.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.585
The princess tried
to fight it,

08:18.628 --> 08:21.979
but using her magic only made
the Darkness stronger.

08:22.023 --> 08:25.809
It was tied to her somehow,
and if she kept fighting it,

08:25.853 --> 08:29.465
the Darkness would grow
to cover the entire land.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.729
So Princess Josie

08:32.773 --> 08:34.992
placed
a sleeping spell on herself

08:35.036 --> 08:37.473
so that she could never
do magic again,

08:37.517 --> 08:42.260
and so that the Darkness
could never grow.

08:42.304 --> 08:47.048
If we wake her up,
the Darkness will grow again.

08:47.091 --> 08:50.225
So... as much as
we all miss her,

08:50.268 --> 08:51.835
this is how it has to be.

08:51.879 --> 08:55.796
Destiny's a bitch, huh, doll?Maybe.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.580
But I still have to try.

08:57.624 --> 09:00.801
She would do the same for me.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.977
And I think I know
how to find her.

09:04.674 --> 09:08.286
PIG:
Uh, you don't want to do that.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.854
Where's the rest of the trail?

09:10.898 --> 09:13.640
Well, um,
here's the thing.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.032
You-You're not gonna
believe this.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.600
The, uh-- Whenever, heh,

09:17.644 --> 09:20.734
the, uh, elements, um...

09:20.777 --> 09:24.389
Uh, you know what, I ate it.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.217
Okay? I ateit!

09:26.261 --> 09:29.220
Ha ha! "Why would I
do that?" she asks.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.614
Because I'm disgusting,
and I have no self-control.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.877
Do you see the package
that I'm working with right now?

09:33.921 --> 09:36.184
Okay, you know where
this trail goes.

09:36.227 --> 09:37.489
You know where she is.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.230
If you don't tell me

09:39.274 --> 09:41.058
where she went,
I'm gonna start doing magic.

09:41.102 --> 09:44.322
The Darkness will come.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.847
Facing darkness is
kind of my thing.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.805
Fine.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.894
Fine! Gah!

09:50.938 --> 09:53.114
You're a bossy little thing,
you know that?

09:53.157 --> 09:55.812
Ah, that's a compliment
in my world.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.206
Remind me not to visit
that place.

09:58.249 --> 10:01.775
Raf, just calm down, okay?

10:01.818 --> 10:04.386
Whatever it is,
it can't be that bad.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.828
I killed him,
Dr. Saltzman.

10:13.569 --> 10:17.268
The Necromancer made me do it.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.709
We're gonna figure all that out,
okay? Just--

10:22.752 --> 10:25.407
It's okay.

10:27.714 --> 10:28.889
Look, he's gonna come back.

10:28.932 --> 10:31.805
He'll come back.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.634
Not this time.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.692
Josie? Josie?

10:49.736 --> 10:51.128
Josie, wake up.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.564
You should try kissing her,
maybe.

10:52.608 --> 10:55.480
I know this is
a fairy tale and all,

10:55.524 --> 10:57.744
but a nonconsensual kiss
is never the answer.

10:57.787 --> 10:59.833
Well, excuse me,
little Miss Big Words.

10:59.876 --> 11:02.139
You got a better idea?

11:02.183 --> 11:03.706
I do.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.142
Surgere.

11:05.186 --> 11:06.753
Hey!

11:06.796 --> 11:09.277
We said no magic.I know you're scared

11:09.320 --> 11:11.932
of the Darkness, but this is
Josie's subconscious.

11:11.975 --> 11:14.804
Nothing can really hurt us here.Oh!

11:30.037 --> 11:32.866
What the hell is that?

11:32.909 --> 11:35.172
That is the Darkness,
sweetheart.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.435
And it can definitely hurt us.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.928
Little pig,

11:51.972 --> 11:53.364
little pig,

11:53.408 --> 11:56.933
who's your new friend?

11:56.977 --> 11:58.979
I can smell

11:59.022 --> 12:01.938
that magic's
being used here again.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.298
Saithus.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.266
Happy now, you dumb broad?

12:25.309 --> 12:27.790
You nearly got
us both eaten--

12:27.834 --> 12:31.054
which is a lifelong fear of
mine, I'll have you know.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.665
And now the Darkness knows

12:33.709 --> 12:35.798
your magic-using ass is here.Yeah? Well,

12:35.842 --> 12:36.930
my magic just saved our asses.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.454
AfterI pulled you
to safety.

12:39.497 --> 12:40.977
Oh, yeah. Thank you

12:41.021 --> 12:42.196
so much for
pulling me behind

12:42.239 --> 12:43.980
a single piece of rubble.What do you want

12:44.024 --> 12:46.026
from me? I got hooves for hands.I want you

12:46.069 --> 12:47.679
to stop talking down to me

12:47.723 --> 12:49.812
and be grateful that I
just saved our bacon.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.466
Oh!

12:51.509 --> 12:53.598
How dare you!

12:53.642 --> 12:54.817
I'm sorry.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.950
It's just a figure of speech,
all right?

12:58.952 --> 13:01.563
Look, truce, okay?

13:02.738 --> 13:04.305
We both miss Josie.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.481
We can work together
to wake her up.

13:07.525 --> 13:08.918
If we do that,

13:08.962 --> 13:11.616
the Darkness
will only grow again.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.663
Princess Josie
did what she did for a reason.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.186
She made her sacrifice

13:16.230 --> 13:18.188
because she didn't know
that help was coming.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.234
So, if we can't
wake her up,

13:20.277 --> 13:22.671
then we're just gonna have to
defeat the Darkness ourselves.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.198
What's Landon up to?

13:28.242 --> 13:29.765
I don't know.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.551
Probably off somewhere
being a total beta.

13:33.595 --> 13:36.206
Which I'm super into.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.904
Mmm.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.515
You bringing anyone
to the funeral?

13:40.558 --> 13:43.648
You guys are bringing dates
to the funeral?

13:43.692 --> 13:45.085
Aren't you in,

13:45.128 --> 13:47.870
like, mourning or whatever?

13:47.914 --> 13:49.219
Over Lizzie?

13:49.263 --> 13:51.918
I thought she was
pretty popular.

13:51.961 --> 13:55.312
Because we were all
scared of crossing her.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.097
It's kind of a relief

13:57.140 --> 13:59.316
to not have to worry
about what crazy thing

13:59.360 --> 14:00.883
she's going to do next.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.668
Besides, it's not
like she's gone.

14:03.712 --> 14:07.150
If The Necromancer brought
drama queen Alyssa back,

14:07.194 --> 14:09.587
who's to say he can't
bring Lizzie back, too?

14:09.631 --> 14:10.893
Unfortunately.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.072
We need more ribbon.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.379
WADE:
Memory of Lizzie.

14:18.422 --> 14:21.904
Oh, uh, once,
she put up a barrier spell

14:21.948 --> 14:24.776
and trapped us all in the school
with a gargoyle.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.518
Um, not really sure
why she did that,

14:27.562 --> 14:30.043
but it was...
it was pretty scary.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.088
JED:
Yeah, no, uh...

14:32.132 --> 14:33.829
More like
a personal memory.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.876
Oh. Um... Okay.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.923
Once, she walked by me

14:40.967 --> 14:44.840
and just said, "Hard pass"
for no reason.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.581
KALEB:
Um, okay, cut.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.757
Um, uh...

14:48.800 --> 14:50.106
That felt pretty good to me.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.152
Y'all need
anything else or...?

14:52.195 --> 14:53.805
I think...

14:53.849 --> 14:55.111
We'll call you.We'll call you.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.243
Great.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.985
All right.

14:59.028 --> 15:01.988
Yeah, we're gonna need
to edit that last one.

15:02.031 --> 15:04.816
It's a memorial,
not a roast.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.949
Yeah, it's pointless, man.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.734
We'll never get them to say
anything nice about Lizzie.

15:09.778 --> 15:13.042
Girl has burned everyone in
this school at least once.Yeah, well,

15:13.086 --> 15:14.130
doesn't mean
we give up on her.

15:14.174 --> 15:16.002
Everyone thought
Alyssa was mean, too.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.655
They just didn't know
the real her.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.441
Okay.

15:23.052 --> 15:25.141
You think Alyssa's doing okay?

15:25.185 --> 15:27.187
Dude, I'm not gonna talk
about this.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.145
Especially not with you.

15:33.193 --> 15:36.196
NECROMANCER:
We've been watching
the basin all day,

15:36.239 --> 15:39.199
as requested.

15:39.242 --> 15:41.679
The entire school,
including the Tribrid,

15:41.723 --> 15:45.205
is planning a memorial
for your sister,

15:45.248 --> 15:46.989
who is dead.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.817
Which we already knew.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.558
Mm.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.473
There's something new in my mind

15:52.516 --> 15:54.431
that I can't
quite reach.

15:54.475 --> 15:57.130
Something that
shouldn't be there.

15:58.435 --> 16:01.090
That means they're acting.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.483
Which means they know

16:02.526 --> 16:04.441
about your little
zombie eye.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.356
You've been fooled,

16:06.400 --> 16:08.358
Ted.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.970
Don't ever...

16:14.886 --> 16:17.193
Well, what do you want me to do?

16:17.237 --> 16:19.456
My father must be behind this.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.677
Have a chat with him.

16:27.073 --> 16:30.250
I'll search my mind...

16:32.078 --> 16:35.690
...for the thing
that's out of place.

16:36.734 --> 16:39.041
As you wish.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.221
Oh, my God. Lizzie.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.136
You're alive...Drop it. Okay?

16:47.180 --> 16:48.224
The coast is clear.

16:48.268 --> 16:49.747
Then what are you doing?

16:49.791 --> 16:52.750
I couldn't pretend
for one more second.

16:52.794 --> 16:55.057
Nobody is upset
about me being dead.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.277
They all hate me.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.105
They don't hate you, Lizzie's

16:59.148 --> 17:01.237
good friend Hope.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.718
I think

17:03.761 --> 17:05.850
they only just got
to know one side of her.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.678
That's what my
eulogy's about.

17:07.722 --> 17:11.160
Great idea. The perfect eulogy
would force everyone to remember

17:11.204 --> 17:14.424
what an amazing person
that... shewas.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.731
And I should be
the one to do it.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.080
After all,

17:18.124 --> 17:20.082
I knew her the best.

17:20.126 --> 17:23.303
I don't, I don't think
that's a good idea.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.914
It's what Lizzie
would've wanted.

17:27.176 --> 17:29.135
Okay.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.875
RAFAEL:
This is all wrong.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.269
He always comes back by now.

17:33.313 --> 17:36.011
It never takes this long.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.447
All right,
let's not panic, okay?

17:37.491 --> 17:40.276
The prophecy said
"felled" by a golden arrow.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.148
Now, "felled" could mean
anything. We just have to find

17:42.191 --> 17:43.801
the original Coptic word.

17:43.845 --> 17:46.282
Do you remember what else
is said in the prophecy?

17:46.326 --> 17:48.110
The wolf with many faces.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.895
I killed him.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.507
The Necromancer can make me
kill again whenever he wants.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.335
Listen to me. I am gonna get
that monster out of your head.

17:55.378 --> 17:58.120
No. You got to put me down.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.732
That is not an option.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.299
Look, look.

18:03.343 --> 18:07.173
I warned Landon
that I can't control this.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.088
Now, if you don't do this now...

18:10.959 --> 18:13.048
...then it might be too late.

18:14.441 --> 18:16.965
All right, listen, uh...

18:17.008 --> 18:19.315
W-We're gonna get
a sleeping spell.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.360
All right?
And we're gonna put you

18:20.403 --> 18:22.318
in a state
of suspended animation

18:22.362 --> 18:24.059
until we figure
this all out.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.365
I am not losing
another student.

18:25.408 --> 18:26.844
Then why did you bring
that down with you

18:26.888 --> 18:28.194
when you got your book?

18:31.458 --> 18:32.981
That is just a precaution.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.809
I am trying
to keep everyone safe.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.116
So am I!

18:49.824 --> 18:52.174
Pick up your sword.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.483
No.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.442
Do it! Pick it up!

18:59.486 --> 19:01.009
Raf...

19:02.228 --> 19:03.577
Do it or I will kill you.

19:03.620 --> 19:06.884
I don't believe you.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.234
Pick it up.

19:08.277 --> 19:09.887
You need to stop me.

19:09.931 --> 19:12.194
You killing Landon
is not your fault, okay?

19:12.238 --> 19:14.544
I'm gonna find a way
to save you both.

19:14.588 --> 19:18.113
All right? You're not
responsible for killing Landon.

19:37.698 --> 19:41.310
Well, he did try
to warn you, Alaric.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.803
Where's my dad?

19:55.846 --> 19:58.414
He'll be here any moment.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.163
A memory of Lizzie?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.251
Um...

20:11.210 --> 20:13.690
I miss Lizzie so bad.

20:13.734 --> 20:16.432
The entire school
will never get over it.

20:16.476 --> 20:17.738
JED: Lizzie was always...

20:17.781 --> 20:19.305
uh...

20:19.348 --> 20:20.871
really cool.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.439
Really hot.

20:23.483 --> 20:24.484
KALEB:
So many memories

20:24.527 --> 20:25.920
of Lizzie.

20:25.963 --> 20:28.444
And the fact that we remember

20:28.488 --> 20:32.318
Lizzie at all means that
she didn't go into Malivore.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.450
Which, that-that's
something...All right.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.278
Uh...

20:36.322 --> 20:38.367
Technical difficulties, folks.

20:38.411 --> 20:42.328
We're just gonna move on with
the next part of the service.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.336
KALEB:
Thank you.

20:50.379 --> 20:53.295
Uh...

20:53.339 --> 20:54.688
This one's for Lizzie Saltzman.

20:56.951 --> 21:00.346
♪ How do I

21:41.735 --> 21:45.260
Thank you so much
for whatever that was.

21:48.394 --> 21:52.049
I'm here today
to deliver the eulogy

21:52.093 --> 21:55.139
for Elizabeth Jenna Saltzman.

21:55.183 --> 21:59.579
Lizzie was more than one thing.

21:59.622 --> 22:03.409
She was a witch, a daredevil,
a lover.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.803
Was she a saint?

22:06.847 --> 22:08.501
Eh, who's to say?

22:08.544 --> 22:11.025
But I can say this.

22:11.068 --> 22:14.507
She was the absolute best of us.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.380
She was a kind soul.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.559
She waskind, and nice.

22:23.603 --> 22:26.780
And sometimes she was just tired

22:26.823 --> 22:28.956
or having a bad day,
or whatever.

22:33.221 --> 22:36.442
You all think you knew her,
but you didn't.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.182
You're all wrong!

22:50.107 --> 22:53.023
That's strange.
He's always home.

22:53.067 --> 22:56.026
Hello?
Mr. Huntsman.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.420
I brought a nosy friend.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.425
Oh, stew's on.
He must be nearby.

23:07.690 --> 23:10.476
Ah. Nice.

23:10.519 --> 23:12.869
Sweetie, if you think that's
enough to stop the Darkness,

23:12.913 --> 23:15.089
you are crazy.

23:15.132 --> 23:17.961
Probably, but I'm not going down
without a fight.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.096
What do you say?

23:22.139 --> 23:23.445
Are you in?

23:23.489 --> 23:26.143
I-I would be no use in battle.

23:26.187 --> 23:28.581
I-I know, I bluster a lot.

23:28.624 --> 23:31.584
But, uh, I just get so scared,

23:31.627 --> 23:34.630
and then I say dumb stuff
when I'm scared.

23:34.674 --> 23:35.892
Yeah, I know.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.241
I-I could finish
the stew, though.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.505
Maybe find some bread.

23:39.548 --> 23:42.464
Uh, make you a nice meal
before you go off to die.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.466
That'll do, pig.

23:44.510 --> 23:47.469
Don't press your luck, kiddo.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.645
Ah...

23:54.998 --> 23:56.739
It's a trap!

24:02.310 --> 24:04.660
Little witch, little witch,

24:04.704 --> 24:09.535
let... me... in!

24:16.759 --> 24:21.547
Hope Mikaelson...
are you in my head?

24:28.554 --> 24:31.208
Wh-What, what's going on?

24:32.688 --> 24:34.821
This pub's under new management.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.694
Dr. Saltzman!

24:38.738 --> 24:40.348
He'll make us fight you.

24:40.391 --> 24:42.524
RAFAEL: Don't.ALYSSA: He just wants to talk.

24:42.568 --> 24:43.699
It's true.

24:43.743 --> 24:45.396
I have an offer for you.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.746
I'm not making
any deals with you.

24:46.789 --> 24:48.574
Not even if it
saves your daughter?

24:48.617 --> 24:50.750
Turns out we both
want the same thing.

24:50.793 --> 24:53.970
To get that black magic
out of her

24:54.014 --> 24:55.798
and send her home.

24:55.842 --> 24:57.539
Yeah, but I'm doing that
without your help.

24:57.583 --> 24:58.540
By which you mean
that little

24:58.584 --> 25:00.629
suicide mission into her mind?

25:00.673 --> 25:04.764
Ah, it's going to fail,
I'm afraid.

25:04.807 --> 25:07.157
She already suspects
you're up to something.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.594
It's only a matter of time

25:08.637 --> 25:10.465
before she figures out
what you're up to

25:10.509 --> 25:11.684
and puts an end to it.

25:11.727 --> 25:15.601
I wouldn't care
either way, but...

25:17.211 --> 25:18.952
...I want that black magic

25:18.995 --> 25:20.606
for myself,

25:20.649 --> 25:24.305
and that wretched girl
out of my life.

25:28.091 --> 25:31.399
The good Josie is
still in there,

25:31.442 --> 25:33.183
deep down.

25:33.227 --> 25:34.750
I've seen it.

25:41.670 --> 25:42.976
You set them free, too.

25:43.019 --> 25:44.630
No strings attached.

25:49.199 --> 25:50.636
Why not?

25:50.679 --> 25:52.507
I'll raise these puppets,

25:52.551 --> 25:54.770
then I'll sever my tie
with them.

25:54.814 --> 25:57.468
Can you bring back Landon, too?

25:57.512 --> 25:59.166
Of course.

25:59.209 --> 26:01.472
RAFAEL:
You said you wanted a way
to save both of us.

26:01.516 --> 26:04.388
Come on, you gotta do it.

26:04.432 --> 26:05.694
Listen to the lad.

26:07.478 --> 26:10.699
Yeah, but there's no way
I can trust you.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.487
An unbreakable
covenant spell, then.

26:18.838 --> 26:21.057
If both of us don't hold up
our end of the bargain,

26:21.101 --> 26:23.190
neither of us gets
what we want.

26:23.233 --> 26:27.194
You lose your puppets,
and I lose me magic.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.804
No exceptions.

26:28.848 --> 26:31.633
When you've made up your mind,

26:31.677 --> 26:33.722
you know how
to signal me.

27:05.580 --> 27:06.973
No!

27:18.724 --> 27:20.290
Pig!

27:30.953 --> 27:33.739
What's going on?

27:33.782 --> 27:35.131
Where's Pig?

27:35.175 --> 27:37.481
Oh, uh...

27:37.525 --> 27:41.007
I-I was the pig.

27:43.574 --> 27:44.793
I thought if I
disguised myself

27:44.837 --> 27:45.881
the Darkness would
leave me alone.

27:45.925 --> 27:48.014
You were the pig?

27:49.929 --> 27:51.495
You do realize he said some
really patronizing

27:51.539 --> 27:53.889
and-and sexist things to me.No, I know.

27:53.933 --> 27:55.369
I just didn't want you
to suspect it was me,

27:55.412 --> 27:56.849
because I need you to leave.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.807
Okay? I don't want you
to get hurt.

27:58.851 --> 28:01.114
Josie, I'm not going
to leave you behind.

28:01.157 --> 28:02.768
No, you don't understand.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.552
I can't have somebody else
get hurt because of me.

28:04.595 --> 28:05.901
No one will.

28:11.472 --> 28:14.344
I love that you thought
it would be that simple.

28:14.388 --> 28:15.694
Oh, my God, run!

28:30.839 --> 28:34.756
Okay, time for some real talk.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.629
MG:
I have something to say.

28:38.673 --> 28:42.764
My first day here,
Lizzie was my tour guide.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.071
Just like she was
for most of you.

28:48.988 --> 28:50.467
I was so scared.

28:52.034 --> 28:53.644
And she knew it, too.

28:53.688 --> 28:58.040
At the end of my tour,
I mentioned... hating my name,

28:58.084 --> 28:59.389
Milton.

28:59.433 --> 29:04.133
And she said,
"So change it."

29:07.267 --> 29:10.574
"No one here knows.
How 'bout MG?"

29:12.402 --> 29:16.667
Remember that shock bracelet
Lizzie had?

29:16.711 --> 29:20.933
Or when she was suddenly
into talent shows

29:20.976 --> 29:25.459
and-and Miss Mystic Falls,
and-and football?

29:25.502 --> 29:27.722
She was always trying
to start over.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.986
And, yeah, she could be extra,
but she knew it.

29:33.946 --> 29:36.209
And she never stopped
trying to change.

29:40.909 --> 29:43.390
But did you all let her?

29:45.000 --> 29:49.004
Or did you hold onto one image
of her at her worst?

29:49.048 --> 29:51.224
She was an easy target

29:51.267 --> 29:53.835
who couldn't control
her brain chemistry.

29:53.879 --> 29:58.231
So it was easier to think
that she was broken than to

29:58.274 --> 30:02.061
root for her and accept
that she was changing.

30:04.324 --> 30:09.111
If you really stop and think,

30:09.155 --> 30:11.897
I'm sure you have
a good Lizzie story, too.

30:13.594 --> 30:16.031
Here's your chance.

30:16.075 --> 30:17.772
Start over.

30:33.135 --> 30:36.051
I liked to sew a lot.

30:36.095 --> 30:39.054
But there was no one else
to do it with.

30:39.098 --> 30:43.493
When Lizzie found out,
she started the sewing club.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.931
We have to keep moving.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.107
It doesn't matter, we're
never gonna get away from her.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.543
Jo, while you've been
trapped in here,

30:49.586 --> 30:51.110
she's been rampaging
in the real world.

30:51.153 --> 30:54.156
Okay, she even tried
to Merge with Lizzie.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.941
Oh, my God, is she okay?

30:55.984 --> 30:58.378
For now. But that's why
we have to stop her.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.861
She's more powerful
than I am.
Jo...

31:05.080 --> 31:06.386
...she isyou.

31:06.429 --> 31:09.345
Or some part of you.

31:09.389 --> 31:11.173
You can control
her somehow.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.914
I don't know how, but...

31:12.958 --> 31:16.091
Landon would have some theory
about the psychology,

31:16.135 --> 31:19.399
and what part of your
personality she represents.

31:19.442 --> 31:20.748
He would, wouldn't he?

31:20.791 --> 31:22.097
Pretty messed-up
subconscious

31:22.141 --> 31:23.403
you got here, by the way.

31:23.446 --> 31:25.971
Are we surprised?

31:26.014 --> 31:28.277
My mom used to read us
fairy tales

31:28.321 --> 31:30.323
for bedtime stories.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.499
They were so calming.

31:32.542 --> 31:35.023
There was good guys
and bad guys.

31:35.067 --> 31:37.634
Very clear rules
that you had to follow.

31:37.678 --> 31:40.115
It all made sense.

31:40.159 --> 31:41.987
Unlike my life.

31:43.031 --> 31:46.295
Well, this fairy tale sucks.

31:46.339 --> 31:50.038
It's accurate. I'm either
the powerful, petty bitch

31:50.082 --> 31:51.866
or the good, weak victim.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.043
That's the story
that you're telling yourself.

31:55.087 --> 31:57.959
I mean, your subconscious
made a fairy tale

31:58.003 --> 32:01.832
that the good you is weak
and the powerful you is evil.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.358
Tell yourself a different story.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.362
Ah!

32:11.233 --> 32:12.800
Ah!

32:15.194 --> 32:17.065
Boring.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.197
Let's fight.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.680
That's strike one.

32:24.377 --> 32:25.682
Icaeus...

32:29.077 --> 32:31.471
Ah, thanks for the extra magic.

32:31.514 --> 32:33.821
That's strike two.

32:33.864 --> 32:35.127
Josie, you can
fight her.

32:37.259 --> 32:39.827
Hmm, that's strike three.

32:41.394 --> 32:44.049
Josie! Change
the story.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.455
DARK JOSIE:
Boo.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.590
Please.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.113
I hate you.

33:05.157 --> 33:07.028
You're so weak

33:07.072 --> 33:10.379
and vulnerable.

33:10.423 --> 33:12.686
The kind of girl who's so quiet

33:12.729 --> 33:15.080
that her father and mother
forget about her

33:15.123 --> 33:16.820
in the chaos of Lizzie.

33:16.864 --> 33:20.259
The kind of girl Penelope
won't fight for anymore.

33:20.302 --> 33:24.741
The kind of girl Landon
breaks up with in one speech.

33:24.785 --> 33:29.007
The kind of girl who's destined
to lose the Merge.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.710
You needed me.

33:36.753 --> 33:38.755
Because without me,

33:38.799 --> 33:41.019
you would have never survived.

33:42.759 --> 33:45.023
This is what being strong
looks like.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.114
HOPE:
That's the story
that you're telling yourself.

33:49.157 --> 33:52.726
That the good you is weak,
and the powerful you is evil.

33:52.769 --> 33:55.163
I was afraid of being strong.

33:56.904 --> 33:59.950
I thought being strong
meant hurting Lizzie.

33:59.994 --> 34:01.561
Oh! Josie, please!

34:01.604 --> 34:03.345
DARK JOSIE: Here's what
being strong looks like.

34:03.389 --> 34:05.347
JOSIE:
Or being like Kai.
I told myself

34:05.391 --> 34:07.306
that being powerful
meant being evil.

34:10.526 --> 34:13.312
But it doesn't.

34:15.357 --> 34:19.361
Hope is strong.

34:21.146 --> 34:23.278
And she's good.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.106
You made a story...

34:29.415 --> 34:33.332
Imade a story...

34:33.375 --> 34:35.986
where I was powerless.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.553
But that's not true.

34:44.343 --> 34:46.562
Because I can change this story.

34:46.606 --> 34:47.955
Enough.

34:47.998 --> 34:50.218
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

34:50.262 --> 34:52.786
Because I'm holding the axe.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.748
Finidus...

34:58.792 --> 35:00.620
I just bound you
to this cabin.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.012
You're trapped here forever.

35:02.056 --> 35:05.146
I'm not trapped.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.105
Because we're not
in the cabin anymore.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.327
And... if you use your magic
against me,

35:12.371 --> 35:14.416
it hurts you, too.

35:17.419 --> 35:19.465
But most importantly...

35:21.031 --> 35:22.990
...you're not wearing
armor anymore.

35:34.001 --> 35:36.395
It's over.

35:36.438 --> 35:38.048
It'll never be over.

35:38.092 --> 35:40.355
As long as you
have black magic in you.

35:40.399 --> 35:44.359
I will always find a way back.

35:44.403 --> 35:47.014
We'll see.

35:52.411 --> 35:57.416

36:41.373 --> 36:43.288

36:53.559 --> 36:56.126
Um, maybe later,
we can, uh...

36:58.303 --> 36:59.739
Okay.

36:59.782 --> 37:02.437
Yeah. You...

37:02.481 --> 37:05.484
You want
to talk about this?

37:05.527 --> 37:08.356
No, man, she be--
I'm good.

37:10.445 --> 37:12.491
She didn't
have to be rude.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.754
Is really the thing.Right? We're
people, too.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.756
People.
I mean, I have
feelings.

37:16.799 --> 37:21.282
Thank you for not
giving up on me.

37:21.326 --> 37:23.545
Even though I
didn't deserve it.

37:25.460 --> 37:28.507
You know, one of the many joys
of being your father

37:28.550 --> 37:30.552
is getting to see you slowly

37:30.596 --> 37:33.294
figure out how much
you deserve.

37:33.338 --> 37:37.167
And one day, you'll realize
that what you deserve

37:37.211 --> 37:39.344
is to never be given up on.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.956
Tell me that when
the all-powerful Necromancer

37:42.999 --> 37:44.305

40:36.129 --> 40:38.305
Yeah, but we had a deal.

40:38.348 --> 40:39.872
He made good
on part of it.

40:39.915 --> 40:41.700
My heartbeat's back.
I'm alive.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.049
It doesn't feel like I have
that little voice

40:43.092 --> 40:44.354
in my head anymore.

40:44.398 --> 40:47.183
I'm free.

40:47.227 --> 40:50.491
Landon should be back by now.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.497
ALARIC:
Yeah.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.979
That's not
our only problem.

41:08.553 --> 41:11.077
I don't understand.
What's wrong with her?

41:11.120 --> 41:12.861
I'm not sure.

41:12.905 --> 41:15.255
But she won't wake up.
