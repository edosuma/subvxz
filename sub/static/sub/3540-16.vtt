00:02.135 --> 00:03.830
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.003 --> 00:06.973
For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.004
I know the risk
but I have to know her.

00:09.175 --> 00:12.042
Elena. She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

00:12.278 --> 00:14.576
- Anna, your face.
- It's nothing.

00:14.814 --> 00:16.247
It didn't look like nothing.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.509
- Matty tells me you broke his heart.
- Mom.

00:18.718 --> 00:20.583
He found his rebound girl.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.244
There's a tomb under the church.

00:22.422 --> 00:24.253
You saved everyone in the church?

00:24.424 --> 00:27.882
Twenty-seven vampires, Damon.
You can't just bring them back.

00:35.835 --> 00:37.530
It's Harper.

00:38.171 --> 00:39.502
I'm glad you found us.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.936
Annabelle, close the door, please.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.256
Hey, Bethanne.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.366
What are you guys watching?

01:09.636 --> 01:12.127
You've been watching
the same thing the whole time?

01:12.338 --> 01:15.205
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.899
This button changes the channel.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.204
Hold it like this.

01:35.228 --> 01:38.755
- Mm. Did you get enough, sweetheart?
- For now.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.799
Anna, are you hungry?
Did you want a little?

01:42.802 --> 01:44.929
No, thank you, Miss Gibbons.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.665
Why don't you lay down
and get some rest?

01:47.907 --> 01:49.465
She's fine.

01:49.976 --> 01:51.443
Aren't you, Miss Gibbons?

01:52.579 --> 01:53.773
Of course I am.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.245
I'm fine.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.695
Hey, Mom.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.635
Mom.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.534
Hey, Mom.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.043
What? I'm trying to sleep.

02:30.216 --> 02:33.447
Uh, I was just making sure you're alive.

02:33.620 --> 02:36.054
I'm sorry, sweetie, it was a late night.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.053
My head is throbbing.

02:38.224 --> 02:42.524
Yeah, um, I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't bring the party home.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.822
I'm sure the neighbors
would appreciate it.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.795
It wasn't a party. It was one guy.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.433
Don't be so judgy.

02:48.635 --> 02:51.365
Yeah, well, I talked to Roberta
at the Grill.

02:51.538 --> 02:57.033
And there's still a bartending position
open if you wanted to get a job.

02:57.577 --> 03:01.377
Well, I figured she'd still be pissed
about the last time I worked there.

03:01.581 --> 03:02.946
I think she's desperate.

03:03.716 --> 03:05.047
I'll check it out.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.711
- Yeah?
- Don't act so surprised.

03:07.887 --> 03:11.152
I just... I didn't know how long
you planned on sticking around.

03:11.324 --> 03:15.260
- Well, there is back rent due.
- There's back everything, Mom.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.326
Like I said, I'll check it out.

03:18.965 --> 03:20.557
- Who's that?
- It's Caroline.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.396
Easy.

03:24.837 --> 03:27.067
Yeah. Come in.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.073
Hi, Mrs. Donovan.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.711
Yeah. Okay, well, we're gonna be late.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.411
- So let's just get going.
- Yeah.

03:42.589 --> 03:43.613
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.088
- How are you?
- Good.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.351
Damon hasn't said a word to me.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.553
Every time I try to talk,
he shuts me down.

03:50.763 --> 03:53.357
- Think he's trying to find Katherine?
- I don't know.

03:53.566 --> 03:58.401
He waited 145 years only to find out
that Katherine could not care less.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.129
And it's gotta hurt, right?

04:00.306 --> 04:02.467
And it couldn't have happened
to a nicer guy.

04:02.642 --> 04:05.133
- You have every reason to be upset.
- Mm-hm.

04:05.378 --> 04:07.209
- What are you gonna do?
- About what?

04:07.380 --> 04:11.407
Isobel, my vampire birth mother, who's
related to my ancestor, Katherine...

04:11.584 --> 04:13.211
...who screwed over your brother?

04:13.386 --> 04:15.286
Nah. I haven't thought about it at all.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.454
I'm sorry I brought it up.

04:17.624 --> 04:21.151
It'd be nice if we could get through
a day without having to deal with it.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.056
No vampire mother or brother...

04:23.229 --> 04:25.789
No vampires at all?

04:25.965 --> 04:27.227
No vampires but you.

04:27.767 --> 04:32.670
I just wanna get us back to
normal stuff like school and homework.

04:34.307 --> 04:35.831
Fun.

04:36.075 --> 04:38.669
Ooh, that sounds good to me,
when do we start?

04:40.446 --> 04:42.107
We can watch a movie at my place.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.978
Uh, with your mom and a six-pack?

04:45.151 --> 04:48.678
You don't really help the situation.
You could at least try to be nice.

04:48.855 --> 04:52.655
Oh, I'm sorry. It's hard for me to show
kindness to people that hate me.

04:52.825 --> 04:54.452
I'm not that evolved.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.127
So a movie tonight?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.963
Whatever you wanna do
is fine by me.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.866
- But I'm late and I gotta go.
- Okay.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.369
All right.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.341
And the keypad is for texting...

05:16.582 --> 05:20.848
...which is what you do when you want
to avoid talking to someone.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.885
Anna, it's Jeremy. Uh...

05:23.056 --> 05:25.149
- I haven't heard from you in a while.
- Ha, ha.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.793
- Okay.
- I didn't break it, I swear.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.793
I was showing Harper
what you taught me. Marvelous device.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.295
- Who was that?
- Jeremy Gilbert.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.327
- Is that your boyfriend?
- Of course not.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.363
- What do you think?
- Very respectable.

05:41.541 --> 05:44.601
That's the goal.
I can't say that I miss corsets.

05:44.811 --> 05:48.178
Susie Sunshine gave me her car keys.
And her ATM card.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.044
- What's that?
- I'll explain later.

05:52.485 --> 05:53.918
Where are you going?

05:54.153 --> 05:58.112
We have some business in town.
We'll be back as soon as we can.

05:58.324 --> 06:01.760
- I trust that you'll keep an eye on things?
- So I'm the babysitter now.

06:01.928 --> 06:05.887
Frederick, if this is going to work
we have to cooperate with one another.

06:06.065 --> 06:09.193
- So you say.
- I'll watch things, Miss Pearl.

06:09.402 --> 06:11.529
Thank you, Harper.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.702
I'm thinking nothing huge, dinner
at the Grill, maybe a late movie...

06:20.913 --> 06:21.937
A double date?

06:22.148 --> 06:24.708
Two pair,
out on a Friday night, coupled.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.181
Yeah, a double date.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.377
- You think that's a good idea?
- Why not?

06:28.588 --> 06:31.386
You know,
we all haven't gone out before...

06:31.557 --> 06:34.890
...and I don't want it
to be uncomfortable for us.

06:35.094 --> 06:36.891
The couple dynamics have changed...

06:37.096 --> 06:40.395
...and there's been a little awkwardness
between you, Matt and me...

06:40.566 --> 06:44.696
...and I just think it's important
that we get over it.

06:44.904 --> 06:45.928
I don't know.

06:46.105 --> 06:49.199
You know what,
I think that sounds like a great idea.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.740
- You do?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.902
A nice evening out with friends.

06:54.080 --> 06:59.040
Sounds fun, as in fun. Hm?

06:59.218 --> 07:00.947
- A double date it is.
- Okay.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.587
Heh. So we will see you tonight.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.553
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.054
Okay. Ha, ha.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.448
Hello, Damon.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.176
Ever hear of knocking?

07:34.353 --> 07:36.446
An invitation wasn't necessary.

07:36.622 --> 07:40.353
I'm surprised
that no living person resides here.

07:40.526 --> 07:42.585
Is it just you and your brother?

07:42.762 --> 07:45.094
Yeah, how do you keep out
unwelcome vampires?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.765
Kill them.

07:53.606 --> 07:54.937
Damn.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.375
Have a seat, Damon.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.975
I was hoping we could have a word.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.615
Sure.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.804
Freak.

08:45.791 --> 08:50.490
We've taken up residence at a farmhouse
outside of town. It'll suffice for now.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.926
- All 25 vampires?
- Not all, some.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.592
I imagine that a few
have already left town.

08:55.801 --> 08:59.794
Others are probably still in the woods,
or like us, acclimating.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.604
- How'd they get out of the tomb?
- I think the witch screwed up...

09:04.810 --> 09:06.607
...that part of her hocus-pocus.
- Oh.

09:06.846 --> 09:10.213
I understand that the founding families
still have a secret council?

09:10.416 --> 09:12.714
- And you're a part of it.
- Pft. That's ridiculous.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.945
I've been in Mystic Falls since the comet.
I'm up to speed.

09:16.188 --> 09:17.382
And so am I.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.890
Now that you've infiltrated the council,
I need to know everything...

09:21.060 --> 09:24.052
...starting with a list
of the members and their families.

09:24.263 --> 09:25.924
Everyone you've supplied with vervain.

09:26.098 --> 09:28.191
Yes, that will have to stop immediately.

09:28.367 --> 09:31.564
What exactly
are you trying to achieve?

09:31.737 --> 09:34.069
Mystic Falls is our home, Damon.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.366
They took that from us.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.771
Our land, our home.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.275
It's time we rebuild.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.345
What, are you crazy?

09:42.048 --> 09:44.073
That was 1864.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.218
Wake up, woman.
The world has moved on.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.081
As a reward, I'm willing to give you
what you want most.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.246
- I want nothing...
- Katherine.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.489
You wouldn't even know
where she was.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.823
You've been underground
a century and a half.

09:58.998 --> 10:03.628
Katherine and I were best friends
long before we came to Mystic Falls.

10:03.803 --> 10:07.967
I know how she thinks, I know
her patterns, I know where to find her.

10:12.678 --> 10:17.138
I no longer have any desire
to see Katherine ever again.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.447
There's no way I'm gonna play the role
of your little minion.

10:21.654 --> 10:23.519
I'm not asking for your help, Damon.

10:24.624 --> 10:28.287
Finding Katherine
was just a mere gesture of kindness.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.121
The rest is nonnegotiable.

10:39.105 --> 10:41.938
I have 400 years on you, little boy.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.838
I'll rip you from limb to limb
without even blinking, and you know it.

10:46.045 --> 10:48.138
I'll be in touch.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.156
You got me flowers.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.391
Well, I figured it's a date,
why not do it right?

11:08.567 --> 11:12.503
I would have driven too,
but you're the one with the car.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.334
You know, you'd think that
for someone who was around...

11:15.508 --> 11:17.874
...when the car was invented,
that you'd have one.

11:18.344 --> 11:22.246
Oh, I have one. I just never drive it.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.549
You know, it's not too late to cancel.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.685
Why would we do that?

11:27.887 --> 11:31.152
I don't know. It just seems surreal.

11:32.091 --> 11:35.492
Like maybe we weren't meant
to get to the normal part.

11:35.661 --> 11:37.424
That's exactly why we're gonna do it.

11:37.596 --> 11:40.156
We're gonna go out, have some fun...

11:40.332 --> 11:43.768
...and try to remember
that we don't have to be so serious.

11:44.570 --> 11:48.404
Listen, when I decided to stay here
and to get to know you...

11:48.607 --> 11:51.201
...it was so that
I could do things like this.

11:51.377 --> 11:55.177
I could bring my girlfriend flowers,
take her out on a date...

11:55.347 --> 11:57.247
...try to be normal.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.479
Have you ever even been
on a double date before?

12:02.488 --> 12:03.580
Oh, absolutely.

12:03.756 --> 12:06.384
Uh, '72. Hef and the twins.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.050
- What?
- Yeah.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.626
Playmates. I got Miss June.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.592
- Are you serious?
- Mm.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.362
Miss Sommers?

12:14.533 --> 12:16.125
Yes. Hi, Pearl.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.233
Hi. This is my daughter Annabelle.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.735
Of course, Jeremy's friend.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.131
- Nice to see you, Miss Sommers.
- Oh. Jenna.

12:22.308 --> 12:25.709
This property was in my brother-in-law's
family for generations.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.539
It's one of the original structures
in Mystic Falls.

12:28.748 --> 12:32.650
Used to be one of those
old-fashioned drugstore thingies.

12:32.885 --> 12:34.910
- An apothecary?
- Yeah.

12:35.121 --> 12:36.611
You don't say.

12:36.789 --> 12:40.384
Sorry if it's musty.
No one's been in here for months.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.390
I'll use my imagination.

12:42.561 --> 12:44.051
Annabelle.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.925
Coming, Mother.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.772
- What's with the glasses inside?
- My, um...

13:01.046 --> 13:03.742
Ahem. My eyes
are a little sensitive today.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.510
- You're new around here.
- Oh, on the contrary, I'm very old.

13:07.686 --> 13:09.119
Bourbon. Neat.

13:09.321 --> 13:10.788
I haven't been gone that long.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.117
I would remember someone
who looked like you.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.657
Yeah? Where did you go?

13:15.194 --> 13:16.684
- Around. About.
- Heh.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.294
Been there. Ha, ha.

13:18.831 --> 13:22.323
I love to see a man drown his sorrows.
It's so sexy.

13:22.568 --> 13:26.163
It's more like nursing my wounds.
And you?

13:26.338 --> 13:29.136
I was supposed to be interviewing
for the bartender job...

13:29.308 --> 13:32.004
...but I think the manager
blew me off.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.303
That's not very nice.

13:33.512 --> 13:36.345
Yeah. Last time I was in town,
I slept with her boyfriend.

13:36.582 --> 13:38.607
- That's not very nice either.
- It happens.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.610
Yes, it does.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.515
Kelly?

13:42.988 --> 13:45.821
- Kelly Donovan.
- Jen!

13:47.226 --> 13:49.126
I heard you were back in town.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.454
Used to babysit me.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.791
- And then I used to party with her.
- This woman is crazy.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.867
- Not as crazy as you.
- Not anymore.

13:57.102 --> 14:00.594
- Well, sit, drink.
- Uh, I shouldn't.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.671
I'm responsible now,
haven't you heard?

14:02.842 --> 14:06.539
- Take a night off, it's good for the soul.
- Great for the soul.

14:08.647 --> 14:10.342
Oh, wow.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.916
- This is not gonna end well.
- Can't wait.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.151
I hate this house.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.587
It's better than the tomb.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.888
I didn't stay locked up for 145 years
to end up locked up here.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.725
Maybe you should quit complaining.

14:34.740 --> 14:37.334
- You gonna stop me?
- Let it be, Frederick.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.671
- You heard what Pearl said.
- I don't care what Pearl said.

14:42.514 --> 14:43.572
What you got, boy?

14:49.388 --> 14:50.855
Try that again.

14:53.425 --> 14:55.893
Back off. Back off.

14:56.061 --> 14:59.588
- We don't fight each other.
- I want out of this house.

14:59.765 --> 15:02.131
- Why can't we go into town?
- Eventually.

15:02.301 --> 15:04.064
But for now, we keep a low profile.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.795
- No one knows who I am.
- The Salvatore brothers do.

15:07.039 --> 15:09.098
And I wish to hell
I could run into them.

15:09.275 --> 15:12.176
They're the reason
we were caught in the first place.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.245
So, uh, Matt,
how do you like working here?

15:17.116 --> 15:20.643
Uh, it's not that bad.
Wait staff tips out pretty good.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.447
They can't keep a bartender
to save their lives but...

15:23.622 --> 15:25.749
I actually put my mom up for the job.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.654
How's that been, having Kelly back?

15:28.827 --> 15:30.886
You know, same old Kelly.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.120
She's trying, sort of.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.493
Kelly and my mom
were best friends growing up.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.498
That's how Matt and I first met.
We shared a crib together.

15:37.703 --> 15:38.761
You're kidding.

15:38.971 --> 15:41.735
No, we've known each other
our whole lives.

15:48.981 --> 15:50.107
Whoo!

15:50.282 --> 15:52.011
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Little Jen.

15:52.217 --> 15:54.742
- Oh, my God. I know.
- It's big Jen now.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.617
Let's have another one.
How many is that? Ha-ha-ha.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.628
Where are you going?

16:04.129 --> 16:06.256
Bethanne and I are going out for a bit.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.456
Hit the town. Kick up our heels.

16:08.667 --> 16:12.262
But we're not supposed to leave.
Miss Pearl made that very clear.

16:14.239 --> 16:15.297
You gonna stop me?

16:17.142 --> 16:19.167
I didn't think so.

16:37.629 --> 16:39.756
- Anna.
- Surprised?

16:40.265 --> 16:43.666
I thought you and your mom
were leaving town.

16:45.371 --> 16:47.305
Change of plans.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.167
I'm sorry, I thought you'd be psyched.

16:52.378 --> 16:54.846
No, no, no. I mean, I am.

16:55.581 --> 16:56.912
Of course I am.

16:57.082 --> 17:01.416
All right, then. Step aside. Heh.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.492
Don't be grumpy. It can't be that bad.

17:11.663 --> 17:12.823
You'd be surprised.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.500
My primary reason for existence
has abandoned me...

17:15.666 --> 17:19.865
...and after today's events, the remains
of the shaky ground that I walk on...

17:20.039 --> 17:21.404
...are about to go kaboom.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.679
Let's get hammered.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.378
Let's.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.613
- Whoo! Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.288
At least they're having fun.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.185
They're drunk.

17:39.758 --> 17:43.125
Remember when Elena's parents
busted us here after homecoming?

17:43.362 --> 17:45.387
- Oh, my God, yes.
- We were wasted.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.862
It was the first time I got drunk.
I blame Matt.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.762
Her parents got seated
at the next booth.

17:49.935 --> 17:53.268
Matt had me pretend that I was
choking so we could get away.

17:53.472 --> 17:56.202
Except her dad was a doctor,
so he jumped up to save her.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.866
And I ran and slipped on the wet floor
and bit it.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.103
In front of everyone.
Do you remember that?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.475
Three stitches, a hangover for days...

18:03.649 --> 18:07.483
...and I was grounded
from seeing this one for a week. Ha, ha.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.582
Well, I'm gonna go to the restroom.

18:13.892 --> 18:14.916
- Elena
- Hm?

18:15.127 --> 18:17.288
Quick, hide. We're not here.

18:17.463 --> 18:18.623
Why? Where did we go?

18:18.797 --> 18:20.992
Children under our care at 5 o'clock.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.566
This is not role-modelish.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.502
Damn.

18:28.574 --> 18:32.567
Hey, so, what made you and
your mom decide to stay in town?

18:32.744 --> 18:34.575
Oh, she got this business opportunity.

18:34.746 --> 18:37.772
She's gonna open up a little store.
It's always been her dream.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.477
So, yeah, we're staying. And I'm
thinking about going back to high school.

18:41.653 --> 18:44.087
- So you'll be seeing a lot more of me.
- Oh, yeah?

18:44.256 --> 18:47.817
Enough of homeschooling. You know,
I'd like to be a normal teen for once.

18:47.993 --> 18:50.621
But I have to ask my mom first.
She'll have an opinion.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.264
I wish you were there now.
I have to write a paper.

18:53.432 --> 18:57.835
I was thinking about squeezing one more
out on the vampires of Mystic Falls.

18:58.437 --> 18:59.665
Really?

18:59.838 --> 19:01.772
- Haven't you exhausted the subject?
- No.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.498
No, I wanna go deeper, you know?

19:03.675 --> 19:06.667
I want to understand
why people were labeled as vampires.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.403
I mean, maybe there is such a thing
as vampires.

19:09.615 --> 19:12.550
Just different from the way
we always thought they were.

19:13.051 --> 19:14.814
What do you mean?

19:14.987 --> 19:21.620
Well, maybe they're normal and good,
just outsiders, you know. Um...

19:21.793 --> 19:23.693
Misunderstood.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.493
You're kidding, right?

19:27.332 --> 19:29.425
Don't you think it could be possible?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.970
You did give me all that info.

19:32.137 --> 19:34.697
Jeremy, I made it up, okay?

19:35.574 --> 19:40.511
I mean, you were all cute and floppy
and I wanted to make a good impression.

19:46.151 --> 19:48.881
- Is there anything you're not good at?
- Double dating.

19:50.222 --> 19:51.746
This is all kind of new to me.

19:51.990 --> 19:54.185
I usually keep to myself.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.849
I don't always fit in.

19:56.762 --> 19:59.993
- That's because you're that guy.
- What guy?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.599
The guy who seems like
he has everything.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.760
So the people that don't
kind of run the other way.

20:07.272 --> 20:09.740
- Is that what I seem like?
- Pretty much.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.772
Hm.

20:12.077 --> 20:14.511
- What a dick.
- Yeah.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.203
Yeah.

20:22.854 --> 20:23.878
So, um...

20:24.990 --> 20:27.049
- What are you doing?
- What?

20:27.259 --> 20:30.695
Well, the point of this was to show him
how much you care about Stefan.

20:30.862 --> 20:33.626
You know, not to hopscotch
down memory lane.

20:33.865 --> 20:36.493
- I was just trying to make conversation.
- Try less.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.264
Caroline.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.242
Katherine.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.279
I'm sorry, you have the wrong person.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.381
Elena, come on.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.520
My mistake.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.089
- How's everything going?
- Matt's cheating.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.131
No need, I'm awesome.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.537
Stefan Salvatore.

21:13.972 --> 21:16.167
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's great.

21:46.838 --> 21:48.669
So you haven't seen him before?

21:48.840 --> 21:51.866
No, there was nothing familiar
about him at all.

21:52.110 --> 21:55.045
Let's call it a night.
Send Matt and Caroline home?

21:55.213 --> 21:58.808
No, the whole point of tonight
was to not have to deal with this stuff.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.475
We need to get through one night.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.615
One normal night.

22:06.591 --> 22:08.183
You sure?

22:08.660 --> 22:10.093
No, I'm not sure.

22:10.295 --> 22:12.024
But I don't know what else to do.

22:12.197 --> 22:16.361
Look, if there's another vampire in town,
he'll still be here tomorrow.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.831
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

22:21.139 --> 22:22.731
Okay.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.409
That's them.

22:31.383 --> 22:32.975
Come here.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.213
Yeah.

22:38.390 --> 22:41.484
Uh, yeah, this is much better than
watching Damon visit Cougar Town.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.059
- No offense.
- Don't remind me.

22:43.228 --> 22:45.059
I've always wanted to see this place.

22:45.230 --> 22:48.563
Yeah, I guess it's a bit much.

22:48.734 --> 22:51.862
Heh. Yeah, my entire house
could fit in here, like, twice.

22:52.938 --> 22:54.872
I feel like I've been here before.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.201
It's weird.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.708
Do you guys wanna watch a movie
or something?

22:59.911 --> 23:02.072
These are great.

23:02.247 --> 23:05.045
That's just a little hobby of mine.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.742
I did the entire Mustang series
when I was 9.

23:07.919 --> 23:10.012
- You like cars?
- That's an understatement.

23:11.089 --> 23:12.784
Come with me.

23:14.793 --> 23:18.456
So the thing about cherries,
you have to...

23:18.663 --> 23:19.721
Mm-mm.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.690
Oh, my goodness.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.796
That's amazing. You were quick.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.873
And that would be my cue.

23:30.609 --> 23:33.203
You're giving up already?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.039
Oh, yeah.

23:36.181 --> 23:38.581
See you, guys.

23:43.054 --> 23:45.784
Prepare yourself, my friend.

23:48.627 --> 23:51.391
Whoa, wait. How do you have this?

23:53.632 --> 23:56.192
It got passed down
through the family.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.099
Why don't you?

23:58.270 --> 23:59.294
I mean...

23:59.471 --> 24:01.063
Why don't you drive it?

24:01.239 --> 24:03.571
Well, it doesn't run.

24:03.742 --> 24:06.074
I mean, at least
not that I could figure out.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.678
Why would you keep a car
that doesn't run?

24:08.847 --> 24:11.008
- Be more of a girl right now.
- Ha-ha-ha.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.013
Why don't you come
take a look at this?

24:13.218 --> 24:15.686
Elena, remember the old Camaro
your dad used to have?

24:15.854 --> 24:16.912
Of course.

24:17.088 --> 24:20.114
- I built and rebuilt that engine 20 times.
- Wow.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.850
Well, I don't like sports cars.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.585
They're too hard to make out in.

24:23.795 --> 24:24.955
No, it wasn't that bad.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.669
- I'm sorry, man.
- No, no.

24:38.877 --> 24:39.935
Don't worry about it.

24:40.111 --> 24:42.045
You and Elena,
you guys have a history...

24:42.247 --> 24:45.307
...and ignoring it
doesn't do anybody any good.

24:45.884 --> 24:47.681
She's good with you.

24:47.853 --> 24:52.847
You know, I wasn't sure,
but she's happy and I'm glad.

24:55.193 --> 24:57.184
All right, let's take a look at this.

25:00.465 --> 25:02.695
Ouch. Damn it.

25:03.268 --> 25:04.997
- Need some help?
- Damn it.

25:05.203 --> 25:08.900
Stupid shoe. Ugh.

25:10.208 --> 25:12.335
Pick up your other foot.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.877
Ahem. There you go.

25:20.485 --> 25:21.645
Thanks.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.378
I think.

25:23.889 --> 25:26.357
Was that Damon Salvatore
you were with?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.516
The one and only. Do you know him?

25:28.693 --> 25:30.320
We go way back.

25:30.495 --> 25:32.087
He still live out by Miller Lane?

25:33.098 --> 25:35.999
He lives in the old boarding house.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.362
By Wickery Bridge.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.395
He's still in there if you wanna say hi.

25:42.507 --> 25:44.668
I'd rather stay here and talk to you.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.673
Oh. Nice.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.748
Very smooth with the shoe
and the flirt.

25:53.618 --> 25:55.813
But I'm a little drunk.

25:56.021 --> 26:00.424
And hot guy plus drunk me
equals very bad things.

26:03.929 --> 26:05.954
I'm pretty sure you'd like it.

26:13.705 --> 26:17.436
I'm sorry.
That was a seriously lame pick-up.

26:17.642 --> 26:19.234
I'm sorry.

26:21.046 --> 26:23.879
That's a nice scent you're wearing.
What is it?

26:24.049 --> 26:25.641
I don't know. Ha, ha.

26:25.884 --> 26:27.715
It was a gift.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.615
And that is a cab, so...

26:39.931 --> 26:41.057
Vervain.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.660
Making it hard to find something
to eat in this town.

26:48.106 --> 26:50.438
- Caroline.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.076
You're being ridiculous.

26:52.243 --> 26:56.009
And insecure and stupid,
but that doesn't change the fact...

26:56.181 --> 26:58.649
...that Matt's in love with you
and I'm the backup.

26:58.817 --> 27:00.614
- You're not the backup.
- Yes, I am.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.412
I'm Matt's Elena backup.

27:02.587 --> 27:03.849
I'm your Bonnie backup.

27:04.022 --> 27:06.490
Now it's about me and Bonnie?

27:12.764 --> 27:13.822
You don't get it.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.294
Why would you?

27:15.467 --> 27:17.935
You're everyone's first choice.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.180
Piece of cake.

27:37.455 --> 27:38.547
You know what?

27:38.723 --> 27:41.191
Why don't you guys go ahead
and take it for a spin?

27:41.359 --> 27:42.417
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.427
Caroline.

28:07.986 --> 28:09.214
You all right?

28:09.387 --> 28:13.153
- Lf it's not vampires, it's girlfriends.
- Mm.

28:16.861 --> 28:19.159
All right, roast beef, turkey.
What do you want?

28:19.330 --> 28:21.264
Oh, let's do the works. Pile it high.

28:21.466 --> 28:24.401
All right, I like your style.
Will you grab the bread for me?

28:24.602 --> 28:26.160
Okay.

28:34.345 --> 28:35.869
- What are you doing?
- Just a cut.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.981
Will you hand me that towel?

28:40.719 --> 28:41.743
I can't.

28:43.354 --> 28:45.584
You got a problem with blood, Anna?

28:47.492 --> 28:49.016
Mm-mm.

28:50.028 --> 28:51.859
What's the matter?

28:57.702 --> 28:59.602
It's just blood, Anna.

29:02.807 --> 29:04.968
- What are you doing?
- I knew it.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.871
Go for it.

29:21.726 --> 29:23.523
Jeremy.

29:24.662 --> 29:26.527
Jenna. Hey, what's, uh?

29:26.731 --> 29:28.392
- What's up?
- Regret.

29:29.901 --> 29:32.062
Make sure you lock that up.

29:56.427 --> 29:58.554
Did I just pass their driveway?

29:59.264 --> 30:01.789
Uh, I think it's up there.

30:02.934 --> 30:05.061
This is an amazing car.

30:09.007 --> 30:11.100
Did I pass?

30:12.277 --> 30:15.269
- Um...
- The whole double date thing...

30:15.446 --> 30:19.177
...was obviously a test
to see how I would do around Elena.

30:23.621 --> 30:30.493
I don't know. You were reminiscing
about the Elena years all night, so...

30:30.895 --> 30:33.125
Caroline, that stuff
came before, okay?

30:33.298 --> 30:34.629
It's not just gonna go away.

30:34.799 --> 30:36.289
- I know that, okay?
- No.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.128
No, you don't.

30:38.303 --> 30:41.864
Because you're letting it turn you
into a crazy person.

30:43.241 --> 30:45.209
Look, it's my fault.

30:45.376 --> 30:48.243
I, you know...
I made it pretty clear early on...

30:48.413 --> 30:54.181
...that Elena
still means something to me.

30:54.385 --> 30:59.687
But all that talk, it was just
two old friends and some memories.

31:00.925 --> 31:02.984
Tonight wasn't about me and Elena.

31:03.995 --> 31:07.487
I was there
because I wanted to be with you.

31:09.133 --> 31:13.934
And I don't know what this means
or what we are...

31:14.138 --> 31:17.130
...but I do know
that you're the only person...

31:17.342 --> 31:19.867
...I want to be in this car with
right now.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.342
I don't even know
if this makes sense...

31:22.513 --> 31:25.380
...because I'm not really that good
at expressing myself...

31:25.583 --> 31:27.517
No, no.

31:29.654 --> 31:32.452
I think you're doing just fine.

31:50.942 --> 31:52.933
Ow!

31:53.678 --> 31:57.239
- Sports cars. Mm.
- Yeah.

32:07.792 --> 32:09.259
Now that you got me here...

32:10.995 --> 32:13.122
...what are you gonna do with me?

32:13.965 --> 32:15.830
I'm going to...

32:16.701 --> 32:18.896
Going to do this.

32:44.729 --> 32:47.994
- Mom
- Damon?

32:48.366 --> 32:49.993
Oh, my God. Matt.

32:50.668 --> 32:52.101
Oh, my God.

33:00.511 --> 33:02.479
- I gotta...
- It's fine, just go.

33:02.647 --> 33:03.807
I'll take her home.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.481
Thanks, man.

33:23.468 --> 33:26.164
- Where have you been?
- Um, I needed some air.

33:26.371 --> 33:27.497
For three hours?

33:29.874 --> 33:31.842
Tell me, where have you been?

33:32.043 --> 33:33.738
Out. I was out.

33:33.911 --> 33:36.345
Annabelle, don't do this.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.278
I can't fight you too.

33:43.287 --> 33:44.345
What?

33:46.691 --> 33:48.852
I'm sorry.

33:58.836 --> 34:01.202
- Sorry I'm bailing.
- Just wish you'd let me drive you home.

34:01.372 --> 34:04.705
Normal people don't have chaperones
or bodyguards or babysitters.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.208
- We're normal tonight, remember?
- I know, I get so worried about you.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.108
Stefan, I can't live every minute...

34:10.313 --> 34:12.578
...afraid that someone's
gonna come after me.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.183
I won't. That's not living.

34:15.319 --> 34:16.809
Okay.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.779
- Call me when you get home safe?
- Mm-hm.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.617
Okay.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.728
- Bye, Stefan.
- Goodbye.

34:59.897 --> 35:01.558
Don't look at me like that.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.893
- Are you crazy?
- Save the lecture, look...

35:54.952 --> 35:56.647
Damn it.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.150
I remember them.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.622
From 1864.

36:03.060 --> 36:05.187
They were in the tomb.

36:05.363 --> 36:06.990
Yeah.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.962
About that.

36:20.311 --> 36:21.938
Matt.

36:25.983 --> 36:28.543
- Matt.
- I don't wanna hear it, Mom.

36:30.855 --> 36:31.879
Matty, please.

36:32.089 --> 36:34.751
Do you know
what I was doing tonight, Mom?

36:35.726 --> 36:36.750
I was having fun.

36:36.994 --> 36:40.691
Trying to forget about all the crap
that I have to deal with every day.

36:40.898 --> 36:43.366
Just enjoy a night with my friends.

36:44.569 --> 36:47.163
And then, there you are.

36:47.338 --> 36:50.705
Wasted at the bar,
where I work, by the way...

36:50.908 --> 36:52.899
...to pay the bills that you don't pay.

36:53.844 --> 36:56.438
And then you're off
acting like a freaking kid?

36:56.614 --> 36:59.515
Hooking up with some guy
half your age.

37:00.751 --> 37:02.776
I'm the kid, Mom.

37:02.987 --> 37:05.285
You're supposed to be responsible
for me.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.383
I know, Matt.

37:21.505 --> 37:23.370
How was your night?

37:23.741 --> 37:26.107
Oh, same old, same old. You?

37:27.078 --> 37:28.568
Yep.

37:38.155 --> 37:41.750
- So where is Bethanne?
- She won't be coming back.

37:42.526 --> 37:44.551
What happened? Where is she?

37:45.062 --> 37:47.121
Well, you were right.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.167
We shouldn't have left.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.400
No.

37:54.839 --> 37:56.568
Hungry?

38:21.299 --> 38:22.960
Next time, you'll listen to me.

38:28.105 --> 38:30.300
I'm home.
Teeth brushed, ready for bed.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.600
Safe and sound.

38:31.776 --> 38:34.108
Oh, good, good. I'm glad.

38:34.278 --> 38:36.303
Is everything all right?
You sound serious.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.947
No, no, no. Uh...

38:38.149 --> 38:41.175
Not tonight. You still have
a few more minutes left of normal.

38:41.385 --> 38:43.285
I'll tell you about it tomorrow, okay?

38:43.454 --> 38:46.184
I had a really nice time
on our date tonight.

38:47.391 --> 38:50.155
- Such a liar.
- No, I'm serious.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.888
In a way, it was exactly
what it was supposed to be.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.996
I had a really nice time too.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.337
Could you help me out a little bit?

39:09.046 --> 39:10.980
What the hell?

39:11.148 --> 39:13.048
I could have killed you.

39:14.985 --> 39:17.010
Yeah, but you didn't.

39:17.488 --> 39:18.512
I should have.

39:19.924 --> 39:22.051
But you didn't.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.387
How did you know?

39:24.562 --> 39:25.893
I knew this girl...

39:26.997 --> 39:28.692
...Vicki.

39:29.133 --> 39:30.760
She, uh...

39:31.502 --> 39:35.768
She was attacked by an animal, a bite
to the neck. She started acting crazy.

39:35.940 --> 39:40.172
You know, weird,
and it seemed like drugs...

39:40.444 --> 39:42.435
...but then you showed me
those articles.

39:44.148 --> 39:46.844
And then I saw your face...

39:47.017 --> 39:48.712
...and how it changed...

39:48.886 --> 39:51.218
...that night in the cemetery
when I kissed you.

39:51.722 --> 39:54.190
Look. You know
you can't tell anyone, right?

39:55.559 --> 39:57.083
Who would believe me?

39:57.862 --> 39:59.762
You'd be surprised.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.462
Why didn't you?

40:04.969 --> 40:06.436
Kill me?

40:07.972 --> 40:09.701
I don't know.

40:10.574 --> 40:13.668
Maybe I'm a sucker for guys like you.

40:13.878 --> 40:15.175
Like what?

40:16.280 --> 40:17.474
Lost.

40:19.717 --> 40:22.208
Why would you confront me about it?

40:22.386 --> 40:24.081
Why would you risk it?

40:24.922 --> 40:29.120
Because if it was true, maybe...

40:30.494 --> 40:33.054
Maybe it's true about Vicki.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.194
And also because...

40:41.305 --> 40:43.569
...I want you to turn me.
