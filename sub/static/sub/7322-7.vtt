WEBVTT

00:02.133 --> 00:04.535
(Derek) ASK MOST SURGEONS
WHY THEY BECAME SURGEONS

00:04.535 --> 00:07.038
AND THEY USUALLY TELL YOU
THE SAME THING--

00:07.038 --> 00:09.040
IT WAS FOR THE HIGH,
THE RUSH,

00:09.040 --> 00:11.212
THE THRILL THAT COMES FROM
CUTTING SOMEONE OPEN

00:11.212 --> 00:13.084
AND SAVING THEIR LIFE.

00:13.084 --> 00:15.386
FOR ME, IT WAS DIFFERENT.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF TODAY.

00:15.386 --> 00:18.119
OKAY.
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I GREW UP
IN A HOUSE WITH FOUR SISTERS--

00:18.119 --> 00:20.121
NO, DEFINITELY BECAUSE
I GREW UP

00:20.121 --> 00:22.053
IN A HOUSE WITH FOUR SISTERS--

00:22.053 --> 00:24.695
BUT IT WAS THE QUIET
THAT DREW ME TO SURGERY.
HOW YOU DOING?

00:24.695 --> 00:27.398
FINE. WHY, DID MEREDITH
SAY SOMETHING TO YOU?

00:27.398 --> 00:30.431
SHE MENTIONED YOU WERE
A LITTLE DOWN ABOUT THE MERGER,

00:30.431 --> 00:33.134
LACK OF A CARDIO GOD.
YOUR WIFE IS DEAD.

00:33.134 --> 00:36.767
AS SOON AS HER LIVER
GROWS BACK, SHE'S DEAD.
BE GLAD SHE DID. THAT'S WHY
I PUT YOU ON MY SERVICE.

00:36.767 --> 00:39.710
MM.
YOU NEED A GOD?
NEURO GOD RIGHT HERE.

00:39.710 --> 00:43.114
GODLY? YOUR ENTIRE DAY CONSISTS
OF PUTTING SHUNTS IN PEOPLE.
TODAY? TEMPORAL LOBECTOMY.

00:43.114 --> 00:45.616
OH.
(Richard) ...OUR SCHEDULE
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW.

00:45.616 --> 00:47.548
HOSPITALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:47.548 --> 00:49.820
HAVE REPORTED
SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS...

00:49.820 --> 00:53.484
HOW BAD IS IT TODAY?
THE CHIEF'S IMPLEMENTING
A COMPUTER MODEL

00:53.484 --> 00:56.457
FOR SCHEDULING OUR SURGERIES
FROM NOW ON.

00:56.457 --> 00:59.660
SOMETHING ABOUT EFFICIENCY
AND PROGRESS.
AND TO MAKE SURE THIS WAS
THE RIGHT DECISION,

00:59.660 --> 01:03.134
I HAVE ENLISTED ONE OF OUR OWN
TO DO A TRIAL RUN

01:03.134 --> 01:05.366
FOR THE LAST MONTH.
DR. SLOAN.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.138
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE ALL THINKING.

01:07.138 --> 01:09.140
IT'S A MACHINE.
IT DOESN'T KNOW ME.

01:09.140 --> 01:11.702
IT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I LIKE.

01:11.702 --> 01:14.175
BUT AFTER USING THIS NEW SYSTEM
FOR THE PAST MONTH,

01:14.175 --> 01:16.477
I GOTTA SAY, PEOPLE,
I'M A CONVERT.

01:16.477 --> 01:19.310
THIS COMPUTER KNOWS ME
BETTER THAN I KNOW ME.

01:19.310 --> 01:23.414
CHIEF, THIS THING HAS REARRANGED
MY SCHEDULE FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK.

01:23.414 --> 01:27.188
I MEAN, HAVEN'T WE HAD
ENOUGH CHANGE HERE ALREADY?
CHANGE IS GOOD, EVERYONE.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.520
EMBRACE IT.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.864
YOU TWO NEED TO STOP BICKERING.
IT'S UNATTRACTIVE.

01:33.864 --> 01:37.428
THE OPERATING ROOM
IS A QUIET PLACE, PEACEFUL.

01:37.428 --> 01:40.431
IT HAS TO BE
IN ORDER FOR US TO STAY ALERT,

01:40.431 --> 01:43.534
ANTICIPATE COMPLICATIONS.
YOUR ASS IS IN MY WAY.

01:43.534 --> 01:45.476
I WAS IN THE O.R. ALL NIGHT

01:45.476 --> 01:47.478
SEWING A HANG GLIDER'S
INTESTINES BACK TOGETHER.

01:47.478 --> 01:50.311
I'M KINDA SORE.
(whispers) I KINDA DON'T CARE.
(normal voice) MOVE.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.812
(Cristina) HEY, ALEX.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.145
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM SWENDER'S OFFICE

01:54.145 --> 01:56.887
THAT IZZIE HAS AN I.L.-2
TREATMENT THIS WEEK

01:56.887 --> 01:59.650
THAT SHE HASN'T CALLED BACK
TO CONFIRM.
AND?

01:59.650 --> 02:03.324
AND, UM... SHE'S YOUR WIFE,
WHO COULD DIE.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.326
SHE'LL SHOW UP.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.329
SHE'S A CRAPPY WIFE,
BUT SHE'S NOT AN IDIOT.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.232
OKAY, UH, WELL, IT'S--
IT'S THURSDAY AT 10:00,

02:11.232 --> 02:13.464
SO YOU KNOW.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.336
DON'T WORRY.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.508
BEING DITCHED BY CANCER WIFE
WON'T CHANGE MY MIND.

02:17.508 --> 02:19.870
YOU'RE STILL A DOUCHE.

02:22.173 --> 02:25.145
WHEN YOU STAND IN THE O.R.,

02:25.145 --> 02:27.418
YOUR PATIENT
OPEN ON THE TABLE...

02:27.418 --> 02:30.421
ALL THE WORLD'S NOISE,
ALL THE WORRY THAT IT BRINGS...

02:30.421 --> 02:32.383
DISAPPEARS.

02:32.383 --> 02:33.884
DR. SHEPHERD.

02:33.884 --> 02:36.557
ISAAC, IF YOU DON'T STOP
CALLING ME DR. SHEPHERD,

02:36.557 --> 02:40.191
I'M SERIOUSLY GONNA
HAVE TO CUT YOU OFF.
RIGHT. FORGOT. DEREK.

02:40.191 --> 02:42.193
THANKS.
I HAVE YOUR SCANS, DEREK.

02:42.193 --> 02:44.695
I DIDN'T ORDER ANY SCANS.
I THINK THEY'RE FOR A CONSULT,

02:44.695 --> 02:47.338
BUT I CAN COME BACK
IF YOU'RE BUSY.
NO, IT'S OKAY.

02:47.338 --> 02:50.501
A CALM SETTLES OVER YOU,
TIME PASSING WITHOUT THOUGHT...

02:50.501 --> 02:54.645
FOR THAT MOMENT,
YOU FEEL COMPLETELY AT PEACE.

02:54.645 --> 02:58.509
(sighs) OH. IT'S A TUMOR
ON THE SPINAL CORD,

02:58.509 --> 03:01.712
POSSIBLY A HEMANGIOBLASTOMA.
YOU'VE SEEN ONE BEFORE?

03:01.712 --> 03:03.254
NOT THIS BIG.

03:03.254 --> 03:06.587
YOU SEE HOW THE TUMOR HAS
WORKED ITS WAY UP THE SPINE?

03:06.587 --> 03:08.589
IT'S TAKEN OVER
THE BLOOD SUPPLY.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.521
HMM.
IT'S A PERFECT TUMOR.

03:10.521 --> 03:13.724
YOU KNOW IF THE PATIENT
STILL HAS LEG FUNCTION?

03:13.724 --> 03:15.766
YES.
INCREDIBLE.

03:15.766 --> 03:19.430
HE SHOULDN'T BE WALKING.
HE SHOULD BE PARALYZED, DEAD.

03:19.430 --> 03:22.273
YOU'D HAVE TO OPERATE QUICKLY,
THEN, TO TAKE THE TUMOR OUT?

03:22.273 --> 03:24.275
OH, I'D LOVE
TO OPERATE ON THIS.

03:24.275 --> 03:26.277
BUT, NO. NO, YOU HAVE TO
CUT THE CORD,

03:26.277 --> 03:28.279
PARALYZE THE PATIENT,
TO KILL THE TUMOR.

03:28.279 --> 03:30.981
WHO'S THE DOCTOR
ON THIS ONE?

03:30.981 --> 03:32.943
YOU.

03:32.943 --> 03:35.916
I'M SORRY?

03:35.916 --> 03:37.988
THESE ARE MY SCANS.

03:37.988 --> 03:40.451
THE TUMOR IS MINE.

03:40.451 --> 03:43.254
I'D LIKE YOU
TO TAKE IT OUT.

03:43.254 --> 03:45.826
I'D LIKE YOU TO TRY.

03:53.964 --> 03:56.937
ONE DOCTOR SAID
IT WAS BAD CIRCULATION,

03:56.937 --> 03:59.270
ANOTHER ONE, PINCHED NERVE.

03:59.270 --> 04:01.542
BUT WHEN THE PAIN STARTED
TO INTERFERE WITH WORK,

04:01.542 --> 04:04.375
I DECIDED TO RUN AN M.R.I.
ON MYSELF.
(pager beeps)

04:04.375 --> 04:07.378
ISAAC, HAD I KNOWN THIS WAS
YOUR SCAN, I WOULDN'T HAVE--
I HAVE BEEN TO
EVERY DOCTOR, DEREK.

04:07.378 --> 04:09.380
EVERY TIME,
IT'S THE SAME THING.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.552
THEY LOOK AT THE TUMOR
AND THEY'RE DEFEATED.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.784
BUT NOT YOU.
YOU WERE INSPIRED.

04:13.784 --> 04:16.957
THAT'S WHY I KNOW I WAS RIGHT
TO COME AND WORK HERE.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.960
I NEEDED TO MEET YOU.
YOU GOT A JOB HERE
TO MEET ME?

04:19.960 --> 04:22.463
I HAVE RESEARCHED EVERY
NEUROSURGEON IN THIS COUNTRY.

04:22.463 --> 04:26.266
I KNOW THEIR STATISTICS,
I KNOW WHO WINS THE MOST PRIZES,

04:26.266 --> 04:30.270
BUT I ALSO KNOW
WHO TAKES THE MOST RISKS.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.972
THAT'S YOU.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.346
ISAAC, I KNOW YOU BELIEVE
I CAN TAKE THIS TUMOR OUT,

04:35.346 --> 04:37.378
AND I WISH I COULD.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.380
BUT THIS SURGERY
WILL KILL YOU.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.482
TAKE THE SCANS.
LOOK THEM OVER.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.983
BUT STOP YOUR MIND

04:42.983 --> 04:45.986
BEFORE THE PART
WHERE IT GETS TO "NO."

04:45.986 --> 04:48.058
THINK "YES."

04:48.058 --> 04:51.021
YES?
(Cristina) SHEPHERD,
I'VE BEEN PAGING YOU.

04:51.021 --> 04:53.023
SHUNT PATIENT, O.R. TWO.

04:53.023 --> 04:57.297
SCREW THE SHUNT.
LET'S OPERATE ON THAT.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.601
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS
ABOUT, RIGHT?
MNH-MNH.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.902
YOU'RE NO LONGER
DADDY'S FAVORITE,

05:01.902 --> 05:04.905
SO YOU'VE GONE IN SEARCH
OF SOME CRAZY ASS TUMOR

05:04.905 --> 05:07.378
TO GET HIS LOVE BACK.
ACTUALLY,
IT'S ABOUT MY PATIENT.

05:07.378 --> 05:10.040
I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND YET.
I'M JUST LOOKING.
ISAAC HAS A CORD TUMOR?

05:10.040 --> 05:13.714
OH, IT'S AWESOME. LOOK.
AWESOME IN A BAD WAY.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.086
IT'S EATEN FIVE LEVELS
OF HIS SPINE.

05:16.086 --> 05:18.048
WAIT, YOU'RE NOT
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING

05:18.048 --> 05:20.050
TRYING TO TAKE IT OUT?
OF COURSE HE IS.

05:20.050 --> 05:22.393
HE'S SHEPHERD.

05:22.393 --> 05:24.925
IT'S A BAD CASE
OF TELEPHONE, RIGHT?

05:24.925 --> 05:28.459
ISAAC'S GOT A BONE SPUR
OR A HERNIATED DISK, NOT A...

05:28.459 --> 05:30.961
HE DIAGNOSED AN OSTEOSARCOMA
CASE FOR ME A MONTH AGO.

05:30.961 --> 05:33.063
I THOUGHT IT WAS A SHADOW,
BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE

05:33.063 --> 05:36.637
THE TINIEST LITTLE LESION
ON AN X-RAY.
THAT SAYS MORE ABOUT YOU
THAN IT DOES HIM.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.640
(giggles) I'M SORRY. DO YOU
EVEN KNOW WHO ISAAC IS?

05:39.640 --> 05:40.941
NO IDEA.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.974
HEY, WHAT'S EVERYONE...
OH, A SPINAL TUMOR.

05:43.974 --> 05:47.518
I READ ABOUT A CASE AT MAYO
WHERE THE SURGERY TOOK 17 HOURS.

05:47.518 --> 05:49.620
THE HEAD SURGEON HAD
FOUR ROTATING ASSISTANTS,

05:49.620 --> 05:51.622
ONE OF WHOM
JUST ADMINISTERED FLUIDS.

05:51.622 --> 05:54.625
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? DON'T TRY
AND LEXOPEDIA YOUR WAY ON THIS.

05:54.625 --> 05:57.788
THIS IS MY TUMOR.
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE PATIENT AT MAYO?

05:57.788 --> 05:59.930
HE DIED. THAT'S WHY
IT ONLY TOOK 17 HOURS.

05:59.930 --> 06:02.933
HEY, I JUST HEARD. ISAAC HAS
AN INOPERABLE TUMOR?
IT'S ISAAC'S TUMOR?

06:02.933 --> 06:05.095
OKAY, YEAH, YEAH.
BOO-HOO, OKAY?

06:05.095 --> 06:07.568
WHO SAYS IT'S INOPERABLE?
CRISTINA.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.471
(beeps)
(Callie) OH, COME ON. IT'S
ALL THE WAY UP TO T-2.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.704
(Mark) SEE, THIS IS WHY
IS GOT INTO PLASTICS.
(Arizona) OH, THAT'S GOTTA BE...

06:13.704 --> 06:18.078
(doctors all talking at once)
WHY AREN'T YOU ALL
AT YOUR SURGERIES?

06:18.078 --> 06:19.810
GO, GET TO YOUR O.R.s.

06:19.810 --> 06:24.585
DON'T SCREW WITH
MY SCHEDULE ON DAY ONE.

06:27.758 --> 06:29.990
(exhales)

06:35.496 --> 06:38.699
I-I HA--I HAVEN'T MADE
A DECISION.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.632
NO RUSH.
I'M A PATIENT MAN.

06:45.976 --> 06:49.880
EVERYONE SAID YOU'D FOUND
THE GREAT WHITE OF TUMORS,

06:49.880 --> 06:52.983
BUT I JUST HAD TO SEE IT
FOR MYSELF.
AND NOW THAT YOU HAVE?

06:52.983 --> 06:55.986
YOU WANT
MY FELLOW ATTENDING ANSWER

06:55.986 --> 06:57.988
OR MY FELLOW SURGEON ANSWER?

06:57.988 --> 07:00.190
FELLOW SURGEON.

07:00.190 --> 07:03.654
THIS TUMOR IS DANGEROUS...

07:03.654 --> 07:06.957
COMPLICATED... AND SMART...

07:06.957 --> 07:08.599
BEAUTIFUL.

07:08.599 --> 07:10.601
THIS TUMOR IS THE REASON

07:10.601 --> 07:12.633
I GOT INTO MEDICINE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.835
TO SUCCESSFULLY TAKE OUT
THIS TUMOR WOULD BE

07:14.835 --> 07:16.837
AN ACHIEVEMENT YOU COULD
HANG YOUR HAT ON

07:16.837 --> 07:18.909
FOR THE REST OF YOUR CAREER.

07:18.909 --> 07:20.911
(laughs) YOU COULD RETIRE
ON THIS TUMOR.

07:20.911 --> 07:24.515
I WOULDN'T GO NEAR IT.
IT'S A BEAST.

07:24.515 --> 07:27.017
IT'S A MALPRACTICE SUIT
WAITING TO HAPPEN,

07:27.017 --> 07:29.079
EVEN IF WE COULD GET
HIS INSURANCE TO COVER IT.

07:29.079 --> 07:31.081
DID I MENTION
HE WAS AN EMPLOYEE?

07:31.081 --> 07:34.084
OUR PRO BONO BUDGET
CAN'T COVER HIGH-RISK SURGERIES

07:34.084 --> 07:36.056
FOR EVERY EMPLOYEE
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.989
WE'RE NOT A CHARITY.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

07:38.989 --> 07:42.062
EXCUSE ME?
THERE WAS A TIME YOU WOULD'VE
CONVINCED ME TO DO THIS SURGERY,

07:42.062 --> 07:44.194
BUT NOW YOUR FIRST INSTINCT
IS NO.

07:44.194 --> 07:46.196
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

07:46.196 --> 07:49.199
YOU CAME TO ME AS THE CHIEF
OF SURGERY AND I SAID NO.

07:49.199 --> 07:52.643
AS FOR MY MEDICAL OPINION,
IT IS STILL NO.

07:52.643 --> 07:55.646
THERE IS SUCH A THING
AS AN INOPERABLE TUMOR, DEREK.
WHAT IF IT'S NOT? WHAT IF I GET
IN THERE, I OPEN IT UP,

07:55.646 --> 07:58.809
I LOOK AROUND--
THERE IS NO WAY. ANYTHING OTHER
THAN CUTTING THE CORD

07:58.809 --> 08:00.551
WOULD KILL THIS MAN.

08:00.551 --> 08:03.083
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.757
YOU ARE NOT OPERATING
ON AN INOPERABLE TUMOR.

08:06.757 --> 08:11.091
IT'S A TOUGH JOB, DEREK.
YOU SURE YOU STILL WANT IT?

08:15.195 --> 08:17.698
(Meredith) SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

08:17.698 --> 08:19.800
(exhales)

08:19.800 --> 08:21.171
I SCHEDULED THE SURGERY.

08:21.171 --> 08:24.575
I'M TAKING OUT THE TUMOR.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.019
MICROSURGERY
IS ABOUT PRECISION.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.652
THE MICROSCOPE CHANGES
YOUR PERSPECTIVE RADICALLY.

08:41.652 --> 08:43.654
THE HAND-EYE COORDINATION
REQUIRED CAN BE LEARNED,

08:43.654 --> 08:45.996
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I NEED NATURALS.

08:45.996 --> 08:48.699
EACH ONE OF YOU
WILL GET A CHANCE

08:48.699 --> 08:51.031
TO GUIDE THIS PEN
THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE CUP.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.304
THE PERSON WHO MAKES A MARK
CLOSEST TO THE PRESIDENT'S NOSE

08:54.304 --> 08:59.039
AND DOESN'T HIT THE SIDE
OF THE CUP GETS TO SCRUB IN.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.141
WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST?

09:01.141 --> 09:03.243
(residents murmur)

09:03.243 --> 09:06.677
TAKE YOUR TIME.

09:15.285 --> 09:17.027
(yawns and mutters)

09:22.092 --> 09:24.094
(Derek) WOW.
DO OVER?

09:24.094 --> 09:25.896
NO DO OVERS.
WAY TO GO, TWO.

09:25.896 --> 09:27.838
REALLY CONCENTRATE.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

09:35.045 --> 09:37.307
NEXT. HERE YOU GO.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

09:37.307 --> 09:40.310
WE'VE GOT NOTHING BUT TIME.

09:43.614 --> 09:46.216
NO. NEXT. SOMEBODY, PLEASE.

09:46.216 --> 09:48.588
WELL OFF THE MARK.
(man speaks indistinctly)

09:48.588 --> 09:51.662
(man) GET OUT.
HOW DID YOU GET
INTO THIS PROGRAM?

09:51.662 --> 09:53.293
(Derek) MR. CONFIDENT.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.165
(yawns)

09:55.165 --> 09:57.097
(groans)

09:57.097 --> 09:59.129
(man) OH!

09:59.129 --> 10:01.201
NEXT. NEXT.
NEXT. NEXT. NEXT.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.173
DISAPPOINTED.
I'M SO DISAPPOINTED.

10:03.173 --> 10:06.076
OOH. HERE WE GO.

10:14.885 --> 10:17.217
NICELY DONE.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.851
IF SOMEBODY IMPROVES ON THAT,
I'LL BE OUT OF A JOB.

10:20.851 --> 10:24.755
WELL, I GUESS YOU MIGHT
NEED TO RETIRE, THEN.
(chuckles) OKAY.

10:31.702 --> 10:35.135
(residents) OH!
OKAY.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.938
DR. AVERY,

10:37.938 --> 10:40.340
YOU'LL BE SCRUBBING IN.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.413
(residents murmuring)

10:48.248 --> 10:49.880
(indistinct conversations)

10:49.880 --> 10:51.882
(lowered voice)
WORD ON THE O.R. FLOOR

10:51.882 --> 10:53.684
IS THAT YOU'VE GONE ROGUE.

10:53.684 --> 10:56.286
I'M DOING A SURGERY
I FULLY BELIEVE IN.

10:56.286 --> 11:00.230
TO PISS OFF THE CHIEF.
SINCE WHEN DID RICHARD
BECOME YOUR B.F.F.?

11:00.230 --> 11:04.034
HE'S NOT MY B.F.F.
HE'S THE CHIEF.
FOR NOW.

11:04.034 --> 11:06.396
HAVE YOU GONE ROGUE?
I'M DOING A SURGERY
I BELIEVE IN.

11:06.396 --> 11:10.400
AGAINST THE CHIEF'S ORDERS.
HE'LL FREAK WHEN HE FINDS OUT.
THERE IS A COMPUTER SCHEDULE

11:10.400 --> 11:12.843
SAYING THAT I'M DOING
CRANIOTOMIES ALL DAY.

11:12.843 --> 11:15.205
HE IS NOT GONNA FIND OUT.
NO. SHH. DON'T SAY ANYMORE.

11:15.205 --> 11:18.108
'CAUSE ME, THE CHIEF,
SECRETS? (whispers) BAD IDEA.

11:18.108 --> 11:21.381
HEY, I THINK IT IS BADASS.
COME ON.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.283
LET'S GO.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.956
SHOULD I BE OFFENDED?

11:25.956 --> 11:28.959
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO COME UP WITH A GOOD REASON

11:28.959 --> 11:32.092
WHY YOU PAGED EVERY RESIDENT
TO THE SKILLS LAB BUT ME.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.025
ME. YOUR SISTER.
YOUR SISTER, DEREK.
I THINK YOU'RE ON MY SERVICE.

11:35.025 --> 11:38.198
LITTLE GREY, I DIDN'T PAGE YOU
BECAUSE I HAVE

11:38.198 --> 11:41.131
ANOTHER JOB FOR YOU.
YOU GAVE ME THE IDEA, ACTUALLY.

11:41.131 --> 11:43.073
I NEED SOMEBODY IN THE O.R.
WHO'S GONNA REMIND ME

11:43.073 --> 11:45.105
TO TAKE BREAKS,
TO BEND MY LEGS, TO DRINK WATER.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.107
I WILL BE YOUR PATIENT,
ESSENTIALLY.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.180
YOU WANT ME
TO BE YOUR DOCTOR?
IF DR. SLOAN'S OKAY WITH YOU

11:50.180 --> 11:52.382
GIVING UP HIS SERVICES,
OF COURSE.

11:52.382 --> 11:55.786
YOU LOVE ME, AND THIS IS
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME TUMOR.

11:55.786 --> 11:58.188
GO GET YOUR, UH, ROGUE ON.

12:03.053 --> 12:06.096
YOU'RE NERVOUS, RIGHT, ABOUT
BEING IN THERE THAT LONG?

12:06.096 --> 12:09.259
ME, TOO.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT?

12:09.259 --> 12:11.762
SHEPHERD DIDN'T EVEN
LET YOU COMPETE.

12:11.762 --> 12:14.104
NO. THAT'S--
THAT'S BECAUSE HE NEEDS ME

12:14.104 --> 12:18.038
TO MAINTAIN HIS CARE
WHILE WE'RE IN THERE.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.510
I'M HIS DOCTOR, BASICALLY.
WOW. SO YOU FELL FOR THAT?

12:20.510 --> 12:22.512
'CAUSE, I MEAN, IT SOUNDS--

12:22.512 --> 12:25.145
IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE
YOU'RE HIS BITCH.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.178
WHAT? NO. I'M--THAT--IT'S--
I'M--I'M NOT--

12:28.178 --> 12:30.420
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO TAKE
A BREAK EVENTUALLY

12:30.420 --> 12:32.422
AND--AND--AND YOU'RE GONNA
NEED TO STRETCH.

12:32.422 --> 12:34.424
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO PEE.

12:34.424 --> 12:37.958
AND WHEN YOU DO...
I'LL BE THERE TO TAKE OVER.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.130
YEAH, I DON'T--
I DON'T TAKE BREAKS.

12:40.130 --> 12:42.132
(laughs) YOU SERIOUSLY THINK

12:42.132 --> 12:44.865
YOU'RE GONNA LAST
ALL DAY IN THERE?
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE, YEAH.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.167
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I KNOW
HOW TO STOP TAKING FLUIDS

12:47.167 --> 12:49.169
BEFORE A LONG SURGERY.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.171
HAVE FUN PLAYING NURSE.

12:51.171 --> 12:55.145
I MEAN, IT SOUNDS... NEAT.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.386
I DON'T KNOW,
I THINK IZZIE HAD IT RIGHT.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.819
YOU KNOW,
GET FIRED, RUN AWAY, DIE...

13:08.819 --> 13:11.191
MER, I GOTTA CALL YOU BACK.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.193
IS THAT
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

13:13.193 --> 13:14.564
WHAT? NO. NO!

13:14.564 --> 13:16.796
NO. NO.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.328
NO!
GIMMIE!

13:18.328 --> 13:20.170
(sighs)

13:20.170 --> 13:22.232
A DIAPER?

13:22.232 --> 13:25.805
IT'S FOR THE SURGERY. PLEASE
DON'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS.

13:28.278 --> 13:31.081
THAT'S GENIUS. YOU NEVER
HAVE TO LEAVE THE O.R.

13:31.081 --> 13:34.544
YOU CAN HYDRATE ALL YOU WANT.
YOU'RE MOCKING ME.

13:34.544 --> 13:37.888
FINE. WHATEVER. IT'S NOT LIKE
I WAS GONNA USE IT ANYWAY.

13:37.888 --> 13:41.892
OF COURSE YOU ARE. THIS IS
THE DEFINITION OF HARD-CORE.

13:41.892 --> 13:45.195
YOU'RE LIKE AN ASTRONAUT.
THIS IS SURGERY NASA-STYLE.

13:45.195 --> 13:48.228
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU PUT IT ON RIGHT NOW.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.160
I'LL GUARD THE DOOR.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.163
(rustling)

13:59.870 --> 14:03.243
ANYBODY OPENS THEIR MOUTH
AND THEY'RE FIRED.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.945
YOU, TOO.

14:06.616 --> 14:08.618
OH, DR. SHEPHERD,
I WAS JUST DESCRIBING

14:08.618 --> 14:11.151
OUR NEW SCHEDULE
TO SOME OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.154
THIS MUST BE...

14:14.154 --> 14:16.586
MRS. TAYLOR.

14:16.586 --> 14:18.628
AND SHE'S UNDERGOING
A CRANIOTOMY.

14:18.628 --> 14:22.032
IT'S MR. TAYLOR, CHIEF.
IT'S...

14:22.032 --> 14:24.895
WE'RE, UH, STILL WORKING OUT
A FEW KINKS, CLEARLY.

14:24.895 --> 14:27.067
WE SHOULD GO.
KEEP THE TRAINS RUNNING ON TIME.

14:27.067 --> 14:30.070
NICE MEETING YOU ALL.
(man and woman) MM-HMM.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.304
ISAAC, IF I GET IN THERE

14:34.304 --> 14:36.506
AND IT LOOKS TOO DANGEROUS
TO REMOVE,

14:36.506 --> 14:39.509
THE RESPONSIBLE THING
IS TO CLOSE YOU BACK UP.

14:39.509 --> 14:41.481
NO, DON'T CLOSE ME UP.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.583
IF YOU GET IN
AND IF IT'S TOO COMPLICATED,

14:43.583 --> 14:45.515
CUT THE CORD.

14:45.515 --> 14:48.288
PARALYZE ME IF YOU MUST.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.521
I SURVIVED A WAR.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
NO.

14:51.521 --> 14:54.524
I SURVIVED A WAR WHERE THEY
PUT BODIES INTO MASS GRAVES

14:54.524 --> 14:56.997
WHERE THERE'S ONCE
A PLAYGROUND.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.999
I SURVIVED
THE DEATH OF MY FAMILY--

14:58.999 --> 15:01.071
MY PARENTS,
MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

15:01.071 --> 15:04.104
THEN I SURVIVED THE DEATH
OF MY WIFE AND CHILD

15:04.104 --> 15:07.107
WHEN THEY STARVED TO DEATH
IN THE REFUGEE CAMP.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.309
I SURVIVED THE LOSS
OF MY COUNTRY,

15:09.309 --> 15:11.311
OF HEARING
MY MOTHER TONGUE SPOKEN,

15:11.311 --> 15:14.244
OF KNOWING WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO HAVE A PLACE TO CALL HOME.

15:14.244 --> 15:16.186
I SURVIVED.

15:16.186 --> 15:19.249
AND I WILL SURVIVE
THE LOSS OF MY LEGS.

15:19.249 --> 15:22.592
IF I HAVE TO,
I'LL SURVIVE IT.

15:22.592 --> 15:24.254
OKAY?

15:24.254 --> 15:26.957
BUT, DEREK.

15:26.957 --> 15:28.428
YES?

15:28.428 --> 15:31.401
THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY.

15:31.401 --> 15:33.703
WHEN THINGS LOOK LIKE
THERE'S NO WAY,

15:33.703 --> 15:35.435
THERE IS A WAY.

15:35.435 --> 15:39.139
TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE,
TO SURVIVE THE UNSURVIVABLE--

15:39.139 --> 15:41.141
THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.674
AND YOU? YOU AND I
HAVE THIS IN COMMON.

15:44.674 --> 15:46.977
WE'RE INSPIRED.

15:46.977 --> 15:50.580
IN THE FACE OF THE IMPOSSIBLE,
WE'RE INSPIRED.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.582
SO IF I CAN OFFER
ONE PIECE OF ADVICE

15:52.582 --> 15:55.325
TO THE WORLD'S
FOREMOST NEUROSURGEON...

15:55.325 --> 15:59.359
TODAY IF YOU
BECOME FRIGHTENED...

15:59.359 --> 16:03.233
INSTEAD BECOME INSPIRED.

16:03.233 --> 16:05.295
HMM?

16:05.295 --> 16:07.637
OKAY.

16:07.637 --> 16:10.270
I'M READY NOW.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.173
PUT ME TO SLEEP.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.154
(woman) 1 HOUR, 13 MINUTES
ON THE SURGICAL CLOCK.

16:24.154 --> 16:26.256
(Derek) THE DURA'S OPENED.

16:26.256 --> 16:28.518
LET'S GET OUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE TUMOR.

16:28.518 --> 16:30.660
(Jackson) WOW.

16:30.660 --> 16:34.064
THAT'S, UM...

16:34.064 --> 16:35.525
WOW.

16:35.525 --> 16:38.628
THE VESSELS ARE MORE INTRICATE
THAN THE M.R.I. SHOWED.

16:38.628 --> 16:40.470
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN GET
THE TUMOR OUT

16:40.470 --> 16:43.373
WITHOUT RUPTURING ONE
AND KILLING THE CORD.

16:43.373 --> 16:45.635
SO, UH, WHAT DO WE DO?

16:45.635 --> 16:48.278
IF I START T-2, I COULD AVOID
HITTING THE FEEDING VESSELS,

16:48.278 --> 16:50.610
SO MAYBE I SHOULD GO LOWER?

16:50.610 --> 16:54.184
THERE'S LESS VASCULARITY
AROUND T-7,

16:54.184 --> 16:57.317
SO THAT DOES SEEM BETTER, NO?
(Jackson)
IT DOES SEEM BETTER.

16:57.317 --> 17:00.520
AND YOU'D ONLY GET
FUNCTION LOSS BELOW THE CHEST.
BUT I RISK

17:00.520 --> 17:03.293
RUPTURING THE ANTERIOR
SPINAL ARTERY THERE.

17:03.293 --> 17:06.096
PROBABLY. THE TUMOR
TAPERS OFF THERE.

17:06.096 --> 17:08.098
HIGHER IS BETTER MAYBE?

17:08.098 --> 17:12.062
EITHER WAY, I RISK SENDING HIM
INTO HEMODYNAMIC COLLAPSE.

17:12.062 --> 17:15.565
(lowered voice) HE'S NOT
TALKING TO US, IS HE?
NOT AT ALL.

17:15.565 --> 17:18.068
T-2 SHOWS LESS POTENTIAL
FOR BLEEDING.

17:18.068 --> 17:22.312
AT T-3, THE VESSELS HAVE...

17:22.312 --> 17:24.074
INCREASED.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.817
(door opens and closes)

17:33.553 --> 17:35.555
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE CONTEST.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.558
WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT?
NO ONE. I JUST--

17:38.558 --> 17:42.061
WELL, I OVERHEARD PEOPLE
TALKING IN THE PIT.
(groans)

17:42.061 --> 17:44.063
IT SOUNDED HARD.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.266
WELL, IT WASN'T HARD.
IT WAS A MOMENT OF--

17:46.266 --> 17:49.269
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE--WE DON'T
HAVE TO DISCUSS IT.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.771
WATCHING LEXIE IN A DIAPER
IS PUNISHMENT ENOUGH.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.744
WH-WHAT? (laughing)
LEXIE IS WEARING WHAT?

17:54.744 --> 17:56.746
(laughs) WELL, THAT--
THAT IS A REASON

17:56.746 --> 17:59.579
YOU SHOULD BE GLAD
THAT YOU'RE NOT DOWN THERE.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.353
NO, THAT IS THE REASON
I WANT TO BE DOWN THERE.
WHAT?

18:03.353 --> 18:06.316
LEXIE GETS TO PEE IN A DIAPER,
AND I DON'T.

18:06.316 --> 18:08.688
YOU--YOU WANTED
TO PEE IN THE DIAPER?
OH, GOD. NO, NO.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.391
I WANT TO HAVE TO PEE
IN A DIAPER,

18:11.391 --> 18:14.394
TO BE IN A SURGERY
SO DIFFICULT AND SO LONG

18:14.394 --> 18:15.665
THAT MY ONLY OPTION

18:15.665 --> 18:18.828
IS TO PUT ON A DIAPER
AND PEE IN IT.

18:18.828 --> 18:20.830
(scoffs) ARE THEY JUST GONNA

18:20.830 --> 18:23.273
LET HIM
STARE AT THE THING ALL DAY?

18:23.273 --> 18:25.875
HE HASN'T MADE
A SINGLE CUT.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.878
IF I CLIP THE DRAINING VEINS
WITHOUT GETTING THE FEEDERS,

18:28.878 --> 18:31.341
THEY'LL BURST.
DR. SHEPHERD,

18:31.341 --> 18:33.883
I REALLY THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO TAKE A BREAK.

18:33.883 --> 18:36.446
IT'S BEEN OVER 8 HOURS.
I COULD GO UNDER THE TUMOR HERE,

18:36.446 --> 18:39.249
BUT I MIGHT CUT
THE RADICULAR ARTERY.

18:39.249 --> 18:42.292
LET'S LOOK FOR, MAYBE IF I GO...
DR. SHEPHERD--

18:42.292 --> 18:45.655
DUDE, IF YOU NEED A BREAK,
JUST TAKE A BREAK.
PLEASE. I DON'T NEED ONE.
I'M HARD-CORE.

18:45.655 --> 18:47.827
ARE--ARE YOU WEARING
A DIAPER?
SHUT UP.

18:47.827 --> 18:51.331
AT LEAST BEND YOUR LEGS.
YOU CAN'T BRING YOURSELF
TO USE IT, CAN YOU?

18:51.331 --> 18:53.403
SHUT UP!
SHUT THE HELL UP.

18:53.403 --> 18:56.406
GREY, I DON'T NEED A BREAK.
IF YOU DO, TAKE ONE.

18:56.406 --> 19:00.870
EITHER OF YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTHS
AGAIN, YOU'RE OUT OF THE O.R.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.614
BATHROOM BREAK.

19:06.416 --> 19:08.248
UM, DR. SHEPHERD.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.750
WHAT?!

19:10.750 --> 19:12.252
OKAY, I'M SURE

19:12.252 --> 19:15.555
THIS IS A COMPLETELY
AUTHORIZED SURGERY,

19:15.555 --> 19:18.258
BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO KNOW THAT THE CHIEF

19:18.258 --> 19:20.260
IS SCHEDULED TO DO A SURGERY

19:20.260 --> 19:22.532
ACROSS THE HALL
IN O.R. THREE SHORTLY.

19:22.532 --> 19:25.265
SO IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON
DOING SOMETHING, ANYTHING,

19:25.265 --> 19:28.167
YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO IT SOON.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.900
THANK YOU, DR. BAILEY.

19:35.645 --> 19:37.807
(Alex) STEVENS.

19:37.807 --> 19:40.310
IZZIE STEVENS.

19:40.310 --> 19:42.882
I-I KNOW SHE'S NOT AT HOME.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.455
YOU HAVE TO TRY HER CELL.

19:45.455 --> 19:47.517
FINE. JUST--NO.

19:47.517 --> 19:50.390
TOMORROW AT 10:00.
DON'T CANCEL IT.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.223
SHE'LL BE THERE.
(hangs up receiver)

19:54.594 --> 19:55.895
WHAT?

19:55.895 --> 19:57.897
YOU MISSED THE CONTEST
THIS MORNING.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.330
OH, THE ONE YOU TANKED?
WHATEVER.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.232
SHEPHERD HAS ASSIGNED US

20:02.232 --> 20:04.934
TO ROUND ON HIS
CANCELED CRANIOTOMIES.

20:04.934 --> 20:07.437
AND AS MUCH AS I'D RATHER
WATCH HIS SUPER-SECRET SURGERY

20:07.437 --> 20:08.938
FROM THE GALLERY,

20:08.938 --> 20:12.412
I CAN HANDLE IT MYSELF
IF YOU WANT TO, YOU KNOW,

20:12.412 --> 20:15.415
DEAL WITH YOUR IZZIE STUFF.
I RESPECTED YOU MORE WHEN YOU
CALLED HER CANCER WIFE.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.987
AT LEAST IT WAS HONEST.
I'M TRYING
TO BE HUMAN HERE, ALEX.

20:17.987 --> 20:21.291
YOU THINK IF I'M NOT THERE,
YOU MIGHT GET TO DO

20:21.291 --> 20:24.294
SOME BIG, BAD NEURO, AND TELL
SHEPHERD YOU DID IT SOLO,

20:24.294 --> 20:27.397
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
MAKES YOU THE DOUCHE.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I TRIED.

20:27.397 --> 20:30.330
GO AHEAD.
THROW AWAY YOUR MARRIAGE.

20:30.330 --> 20:33.433
I WILL BE ROUNDING.
I'LL BE ROUNDING.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.665
(Mark) THIS IS WHY
YOU DON'T GO ROGUE.

20:35.665 --> 20:38.908
LOOK AT HIM. HE'S CRACKED.

20:38.908 --> 20:41.441
I COULDA TOLD YOU
THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

20:41.441 --> 20:44.974
DON'T BE SMUG. THIS IS ONE OF
OUR PEOPLE'S LIVES AT STAKE.
OH, THIS IS SO DEPRESSING.

20:44.974 --> 20:47.847
TEN HOURS
STARING INTO HIS SPINE,

20:47.847 --> 20:50.650
AND HE CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO.
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

20:50.650 --> 20:53.453
WHAT? NO, I DIDN'T--
DID I? I DIDN'T--

20:53.453 --> 20:54.924
ROBBINS?

20:58.428 --> 20:59.929
DR. SHEPHERD.

20:59.929 --> 21:01.691
(door closes)

21:01.691 --> 21:03.893
DR. SHEPHERD.

21:03.893 --> 21:06.496
AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
CANCELED YOUR SURGERIES TODAY

21:06.496 --> 21:09.569
TO OPERATE
ON A SPINAL CORD TUMOR?

21:09.569 --> 21:11.971
DR. SHEPHERD.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.310
THE RATE OF INFECTION
FOR THIS PATIENT

21:20.310 --> 21:22.312
IS INCREASING EVERY SECOND
YOU KEEP HIM OPEN.

21:22.312 --> 21:25.315
NOT TO MENTION THE THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS YOU ARE WASTING

21:25.315 --> 21:27.587
STANDING HERE DOING NOTHING.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.890
SO I AM DEMANDING
THAT YOU CLOSE THIS MAN UP.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.423
CLOSE HIM UP
AND RELINQUISH THE O.R.

21:33.423 --> 21:36.396
RIGHT NOW, DEREK.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.377
OKAY.

21:49.078 --> 21:52.582
THAT'S IT. LET'S CLOSE HIM UP.

21:54.344 --> 21:56.346
(beeps)

21:56.346 --> 21:58.348
THERE WAS NO WAY
OF TAKING IT OUT

21:58.348 --> 21:59.989
WITHOUT RISKING YOUR LIFE.

21:59.989 --> 22:02.722
AND TO CUT THE CORD
AT THIS POINT, I JUST--

22:02.722 --> 22:05.755
I WON'T DO IT.
YOU'RE STILL WALKING, ISAAC.

22:05.755 --> 22:07.757
LET'S REASSESS THIS
IN A FEW MONTHS.

22:07.757 --> 22:09.759
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU WORKED HARD TODAY.

22:09.759 --> 22:12.932
YOU'RE TIRED.

22:14.664 --> 22:17.106
I'M SORRY.

22:17.106 --> 22:19.338
YOU'LL TRY AGAIN TOMORROW.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.871
TOMORROW?

22:21.871 --> 22:24.574
NO, I CAN'T TRY AGAIN.

22:24.574 --> 22:27.116
THE TUMOR IS INOPERABLE.

22:29.479 --> 22:31.381
I CAN'T FIX THIS.

22:31.381 --> 22:33.383
GO HOME. SLEEP ON IT.

22:33.383 --> 22:35.385
WE'LL TALK MORE TOMORROW.

22:35.385 --> 22:36.886
(chuckles)

22:47.036 --> 22:48.798
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:48.798 --> 22:50.099
THERE'S NOTHING
TO UNDERSTAND.

22:50.099 --> 22:52.802
I STOOD THERE FOR TEN HOURS,
STARING.

22:52.802 --> 22:54.103
IN THE O.R.?

22:54.103 --> 22:56.105
YOU STOOD FOR TEN HOURS
AND DID NOTHING?

22:56.105 --> 22:57.807
YEAH. OKAY.

22:57.807 --> 22:59.849
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU NOW.

22:59.849 --> 23:01.911
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
MY DAY?

23:01.911 --> 23:04.884
MM.
OH, MY DAY WAS--
YOU KNOW, I-I SLEPT,

23:04.884 --> 23:06.886
AND I ATE
AN ENTIRE BOX OF CEREAL.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.888
I LEFT THREE VOICE MAILS
FOR IZZIE.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.721
I'M SURE SHE WON'T RETURN
ANY OF THEM.
MM-HMM.

23:11.721 --> 23:14.063
I STARTED AND GAVE UP
ON "ANNA KARENINA"

23:14.063 --> 23:15.825
FOR THE FIFTEENTH TIME.

23:17.427 --> 23:21.400
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THE TUMOR?
I DO, PLEASE.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.933
JUST ADMIT IT.
I'M A SURGERY JUNKIE.

23:23.933 --> 23:25.935
IT WAS MORE VASCULAR
THAN THE M.R.I. SHOWED.

23:25.935 --> 23:28.407
BUT YOU WERE ABLE TO DO
THE DECOMPRESSION?
YES.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.910
BUT YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND
A PLANE TO DISSECT?
NO PLANE. NOTHING.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.411
IT WAS JUST...

23:32.411 --> 23:34.584
THERE WAS NO PATH,
NOTHING DISTINCT.

23:34.584 --> 23:36.716
WELL, WHY?

23:36.716 --> 23:38.518
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST...
IT...

23:38.518 --> 23:40.520
YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:40.520 --> 23:42.021
I HAVE AN IDEA.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.993
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:45.555 --> 23:47.597
JUST WATCH AND LEARN.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.831
OKAY.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.903
THE TUMOR IS HERE.

23:53.903 --> 23:56.435
NOW YOU'VE COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR MIND.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.168
T-7. IT GOES ALL THE WAY UP
TO T-2.

23:59.168 --> 24:02.912
YOU'RE DRAWING ON THE WALL.
I OPEN UP THE POSTERIOR COLUMN.
IT'S CHAOS.

24:02.912 --> 24:06.445
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT VESSEL
WAS CONNECTED TO THE TUMOR

24:06.445 --> 24:07.747
OR TO THE CORD.

24:07.747 --> 24:11.150
SO WHAT I DID WAS...

24:13.683 --> 24:18.157
START HERE, THE ANTERIOR
SPINAL ARTERY COULD RUPTURE.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.859
THE CORD COULD DIE.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.591
HERE, YOU RISK CATCHING

24:21.591 --> 24:23.793
THE RADICULAR ARTERY
UNDER THE TUMOR.

24:23.793 --> 24:25.765
THE CORD DIES.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.237
BUT WHY NOT JUST CUT
THE DRAINING VEINS AT THE TOP,

24:28.237 --> 24:31.000
EXPOSE THE ARTERIES?
THE DRAINING VEINS
ARE VERY THIN.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.002
YOU SLIP UP, THEY BURST.

24:33.002 --> 24:35.004
HE LEAVES MY O.R.
A QUADRIPLEGIC.

24:35.004 --> 24:38.007
I MIGHT AS WELL
CUT THE CORD.
WHICH YOU DIDN'T DO.

24:38.007 --> 24:40.510
NO.
EVEN THOUGH ISAAC SAID
YOU COULD,

24:40.510 --> 24:43.613
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNEW
IT WOULD SAVE HIS LIFE.
WELL, HE STILL HAS FUNCTION
IN HIS LEGS.

24:43.613 --> 24:46.616
NO, BUT WHAT I MEAN IS,
YOU DIDN'T CUT THE CORD.

24:46.616 --> 24:48.618
YOU STOOD IN THE O.R.
FOR TEN HOURS.

24:48.618 --> 24:50.620
YOU KNEW THE CHIEF
WOULD STOP YOU.

24:50.620 --> 24:53.122
ANYBODY ELSE WOULD'VE,
AND YOU DIDN'T.

24:53.122 --> 24:56.495
SO THERE MUST BE
A REASON WHY.

25:06.075 --> 25:09.078
(speaking indistinctly)

25:23.152 --> 25:25.154
(Richard)
THIS PATIENT UNDERSTANDS

25:25.154 --> 25:27.697
WHAT CUTTING THE CORD MEANS?

25:27.697 --> 25:29.699
THE LOSS OF FUNCTION
IN BOTH LEGS

25:29.699 --> 25:31.731
AND POSSIBLY MORE?

25:31.731 --> 25:33.903
WE HAVE TO CUT THE CORD
TO KILL THE TUMOR.

25:33.903 --> 25:35.905
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.

25:35.905 --> 25:38.608
(sighs) OKAY.

25:38.608 --> 25:41.841
THAT'LL ONLY TAKE
AN HOUR OR TWO.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.843
YOU CAN HAVE O.R. ONE.

25:43.843 --> 25:47.246
HUNT NEEDS IT RIGHT AFTER
SO HE'LL HAVE ENOUGH TIME.
THANK YOU.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.749
GOOD LUCK.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.852
(door opens)

25:52.852 --> 25:54.684
(door closes)

25:54.684 --> 25:56.686
WE'RE NOT CUTTING THE CORD.

25:56.686 --> 25:59.288
WE'RE NOT?
MNH-MNH. THE MISTAKE
I MADE YESTERDAY

25:59.288 --> 26:01.560
WAS THAT I WANTED A PLAN.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.862
THERE CAN BE NO PLAN.

26:02.862 --> 26:06.165
I JUST HAVE TO PICK A POINT
AND CUT.

26:06.165 --> 26:09.338
BUT WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY,
IF--IF YOU CUT AN ARTERY

26:09.338 --> 26:12.271
OR HIT THE CORD...
ISAAC WANTS US
TO TAKE THE RISK.

26:12.271 --> 26:15.975
HE WANTS A CURE,
AND IT'S OUR JOB TO TRY.

26:17.306 --> 26:20.209
SEE YOU IN THE O.R.

26:20.209 --> 26:21.851
THIS IS BAD.

26:21.851 --> 26:24.213
THIS IS REALLY, REALLY BAD.

26:24.213 --> 26:25.715
ARE YOU KIDDING?

26:25.715 --> 26:28.017
NO ONE AT MERCY WEST
WAS THIS BADASS.

26:28.017 --> 26:30.319
THIS ISN'T BADASS.
THIS--THIS IS...

26:30.319 --> 26:32.792
OKAY, YOU SAW HIM YESTERDAY.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.824
HE WAS SPINNING HIMSELF IN--
IN CIRCLES,

26:34.824 --> 26:36.826
MUMBLING LIKE
SOME CRAZY PSYCH PATIENT.

26:36.826 --> 26:39.328
AND HE WAS MEAN.
WELL, HE'S
YOUR PSYCH PATIENT NOW.

26:39.328 --> 26:41.330
DEAL WITH IT,
DIAPER GENIE.

26:41.330 --> 26:43.302
HEY, I WORE A DIAPER
YESTERDAY, YES.

26:43.302 --> 26:46.135
AND I WILL WEAR ONE TODAY.

26:46.135 --> 26:49.138
IF IT HELPS GET DR. SHEPHERD
THROUGH THIS SURGERY,

26:49.138 --> 26:51.641
I WILL WEAR A DIAPER,
'CAUSE MY DIAPER IS AWESOME.

26:51.641 --> 26:53.142
MY DIAPER IS HARD-CORE.

26:53.142 --> 26:55.845
YOU WISH YOU HAD THE BALLS
TO WEAR MY DIAPER.

26:55.845 --> 26:59.048
I'M GONNA WEAR IT, AND I'M
GONNA WEAR IT WITH PRIDE.

26:59.048 --> 27:02.121
AND IF I HAVE TO PEE IN IT,
OH, I'LL PEE,

27:02.121 --> 27:04.123
BECAUSE I AM A SURGEON.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.356
THIS IS AMERICA, AND I WILL DO
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

27:07.356 --> 27:11.961
SO YOU CAN KISS MY HARD-CORE,
DIAPER-WEARIN' ASS.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.336
YOU WOKE ME FROM A NAP.
THIS BETTER BE GOOD.

27:17.336 --> 27:20.039
NAPPING DURING THE DAY?
ACTUALLY, THAT IS GOOD.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.341
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
THE REST.

27:22.341 --> 27:25.915
A REDO
RETROPERITONEAL SARCOMA?
MM-HMM.

27:25.915 --> 27:28.217
THAT'S LIKE
A 12-HOUR SURGERY.

27:28.217 --> 27:32.221
YEAH, 15 IF THINGS
GET UGLY.

27:32.221 --> 27:34.954
GO, GEAR UP.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.125
(chuckles)

27:36.125 --> 27:38.758
AH, DR. HUNT.
YEAH.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.329
I NEED A FAVOR.

27:40.329 --> 27:43.332
(drum cadence playing)

27:50.069 --> 27:52.401
HEY, UH, CRISTINA...

27:52.401 --> 27:55.374
NO. N-NO.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.707
SH-SHEPHERD NEEDS THE O.R.

27:57.707 --> 27:59.949
(mutters)

27:59.949 --> 28:02.912
I PUT ON A DIAPER.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.820
OKAY.
I'VE GOTTEN THE PLANE.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.823
READY TO MAKE
OUR FIRST CUT.

28:13.823 --> 28:16.265
I HEARD YOU NEEDED
SOME SUPPORT.

28:16.265 --> 28:19.268
YOU NEED PEOPLE TO TALK TO--
EXPERIENCED SURGEONS.

28:19.268 --> 28:22.001
AND YOU CAN'T SAY NO
BECAUSE I'M IN CHARGE,

28:22.001 --> 28:24.303
AND THIS IS WHAT
I'M PRESCRIBING.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.305
THANK YOU, DR. GREY.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.237
OKAY.

28:28.237 --> 28:31.380
LET'S START.

28:35.785 --> 28:37.787
MAKING THE FIRST CUT.

28:37.787 --> 28:40.990
(instrument buzzing)

28:43.122 --> 28:46.295
(monitor beeping erratically)

28:48.427 --> 28:50.359
WHAT, DID YOU--
YOU PARALYZE HIM?

28:50.359 --> 28:52.902
NO. ONE VESSEL DOWN.

28:52.902 --> 28:55.865
SETTLE IN.
WE HAVE MANY MORE TO GO.

28:55.865 --> 28:59.108
(exhales deeply)
(Alex)
I STILL HEAR SOME WHEEZING,

28:59.108 --> 29:02.271
SO LET'S START YOU
ON ANOTHER BREATHING TREATMENT.

29:09.879 --> 29:12.351
DR. KAREV, COULD I
SEE YOU FOR A MINUTE?

29:12.351 --> 29:14.353
I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

29:14.353 --> 29:18.427
(lowered voice)
DR. KAREV, IT'S IMPORTANT.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.261
YOU NEED TO GO.
IT'S PAST 10:00.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.263
YOU'RE CHECKING YOUR WATCH
EVERY FIVE SECONDS.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.296
YOU'RE DISTRACTED. JUST GO.
I'LL FINISH UP HERE.

29:27.296 --> 29:30.199
SHUT THE HELL UP.

29:30.199 --> 29:32.101
ALEX, COME HERE.

29:32.101 --> 29:34.103
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME,
SO WHY ARE YOU

29:34.103 --> 29:36.245
ALL UP IN MY FACE
ABOUT THIS?

29:36.245 --> 29:38.247
BECAUSE THERE IS A GIRL
SITTING DOWN THERE

29:38.247 --> 29:40.910
ON THE THIRD FLOOR
WAITING FOR HER GUY.

29:40.910 --> 29:43.282
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE ME,
OKAY? SHE BAILED.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.385
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME
TO MY FACE. SHE LEFT A NOTE.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.888
SO STOP TRYING TO ACT LIKE
YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

29:48.888 --> 29:50.960
AND LET ME GET BACK
TO MY JOB, OKAY?

29:50.960 --> 29:53.963
LOOK, IF YOU ARE SURE ABOUT
THAT, THEN FINE. DON'T GO.

29:53.963 --> 29:55.965
BUT YOU BETTER BE 100% SURE

29:55.965 --> 29:57.967
THAT SHE'S NOT HOPING
THAT YOU SHOW UP,

29:57.967 --> 30:00.129
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,
YOU ARE MAKING A CHOICE.

30:00.129 --> 30:02.301
YOU, NOT HER.

30:03.933 --> 30:06.235
SO YOU BETTER BE
AT PEACE WITH THAT.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.582
I'VE CLEARED A PATH
AT T-5.

30:13.582 --> 30:17.386
AND IF I CONTINUE
ALONG THIS PLANE, I--
(monitor beeping erratically)

30:17.386 --> 30:19.388
M.E.P. TRACING'S LOSING
AMPLITUDE. WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

30:19.388 --> 30:22.421
A VESSEL BURST. IT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN CONNECTED TO THE CORD.

30:22.421 --> 30:26.325
BUT IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
BLOOD REACHING THE CORD--
I COULD'VE JUST PARALYZED
OUR PATIENT, YES.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.597
SUCTION, PLEASE. SUCTION.
(beeping continues)

30:28.597 --> 30:31.400
OH, NO.
(Meredith) What, Cristina?

30:31.400 --> 30:34.163
WHAT IS IT?

30:34.163 --> 30:36.906
EASY. CAREFUL.

30:36.906 --> 30:38.607
MORE SUCTION.
THERE'S TOO MUCH BLOOD.

30:38.607 --> 30:42.141
WE'RE LOSING HIM.
I SHOULD'VE JUST CUT THE CORD.
THIS IS TOO RISKY.

30:42.141 --> 30:45.374
WAIT. IT'S BACK.
AMPLITUDE'S UP.
(Lexie) SO THE CORD
DIDN'T STROKE OUT?

30:45.374 --> 30:49.218
YOU DIDN'T PARALYZE HIM?
THE VESSEL WAS CONNECTED TO,
THE, UH, TUMOR. WE'RE OKAY.

30:49.218 --> 30:51.280
NICE WORK, DEREK.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.322
THANKS.

30:53.322 --> 30:56.225
DR. SHEPHERD?
TAKE OFF MY MASK.

30:56.225 --> 30:58.587
WHAT?
TAKE OFF MY MASK.

30:58.587 --> 31:01.891
TAKE OFF MY MASK!

31:01.891 --> 31:03.432
(wretches)

31:03.432 --> 31:07.366
(vomiting)

31:19.578 --> 31:22.982
GET IN THERE. TAKE A BREATH
AND GET BACK IN THERE.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.884
YOU CAN DO THIS.
YOU REALLY SHOULD
DRINK SOMETHING.

31:25.884 --> 31:29.418
I'M FINE.
YOU'RE NOT FINE. YOU'RE
DEHYDRATED AND YOU'RE STRESSED.

31:29.418 --> 31:32.161
YOU REALLY SHOULD DRINK
SOMETHING.
I SAID I'M FINE.

31:32.161 --> 31:33.562
DRINK THE WATER.

31:33.562 --> 31:35.364
I SAID DRINK IT!

31:35.364 --> 31:37.466
(mouths word)

31:37.466 --> 31:40.930
(slurps)

31:59.388 --> 32:01.250
DR. HUNT.

32:01.250 --> 32:04.293
UH, CHIEF.
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
IN O.R. ONE?

32:04.293 --> 32:06.595
YES, ACTUALLY, BUT I, UH,
SWAPPED WITH TORRES.

32:06.595 --> 32:08.597
SHE HAS
AN EMERGENCY LAPAROTOMY.

32:08.597 --> 32:11.060
DR. TORRES IS DOING
A LAPAROTOMY?

32:11.060 --> 32:13.262
WHAT AM I DOING?

32:13.262 --> 32:15.464
WHAT? I JUST HEARD MY NAME.

32:15.464 --> 32:17.967
(sighs) CHIEF...

32:17.967 --> 32:20.970
HE DIDN'T CUT THE CORD.
BAILEY WILL STOP HIM.
SHE'S AT THE DOOR.

32:20.970 --> 32:24.613
BAILEY'S IN THE O.R.
WITH SHEPHERD.
THEN WHO'S AT THE DOOR?
OH, MY GOD.

32:24.613 --> 32:26.715
OOH, NO--WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
MOVE.

32:26.715 --> 32:28.677
NO.
DR. ROBBINS--

32:28.677 --> 32:31.380
I SAID NO.
DR. SHEPHERD IS OPERATING

32:31.380 --> 32:33.382
ON THE INSIDE OF MAN'S
SPINAL CORD RIGHT NOW.

32:33.382 --> 32:35.384
EVEN THE MOST MINOR DISTURBANCE
COULD CAUSE HIM

32:35.384 --> 32:37.386
TO MAKE A MISTAKE
ON THAT PATIENT,

32:37.386 --> 32:39.428
A PATIENT
WHO HAPPENS TO WORK HERE

32:39.428 --> 32:41.130
AND WHOSE LIFE

32:41.130 --> 32:43.162
I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE
DR. SHEPHERD SAVE.

32:43.162 --> 32:46.165
SO NO, YOU DON'T GET TO
GO IN THERE AND BE A BULLY.

32:46.165 --> 32:49.498
NOT TODAY, CHIEF.
NOT ON MY WATCH.

32:57.646 --> 33:00.679
OKAY, I TOTALLY THOUGHT
THAT WAS GONNA END DIFFERENT.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.551
(laughs)

33:04.353 --> 33:06.515
(crying)

33:06.515 --> 33:08.387
YEAH, MORE LIKE THAT.

33:08.387 --> 33:11.060
(Arizona continues crying)

33:11.060 --> 33:13.362
DR. BAILEY,
CARE TO FILL US IN?

33:13.362 --> 33:15.364
NO, I WOULD NOT.

33:15.364 --> 33:19.028
BECAUSE ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF
THIS O.R. IS NOT YOUR CONCERN.

33:19.028 --> 33:21.330
YOUR ONLY CONCERN
IS THIS PATIENT.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.372
NOW KEEP GOING.

33:26.335 --> 33:28.037
(Derek) DAMN IT.

33:28.037 --> 33:29.408
WHAT IS IT?

33:29.408 --> 33:32.711
I CAN'T TELL WHICH ONE OF
THESE VESSELS FEEDS THE CORD

33:32.711 --> 33:35.614
AND WHICH ONE FEEDS THE TUMOR.

33:35.614 --> 33:39.017
I HAVE TO DO A BLIND CUT.
LIKE A TRIP WIRE?

33:39.017 --> 33:42.020
IF I CUT THE WRONG ONE,
THE ENTIRE CORD STROKES OUT.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.093
(inhales and exhales deeply)

33:44.093 --> 33:47.025
OKAY, WE'LL COME BACK
TO THIS LATER.
LATER? SO YOU COULD FINISH
THE ENTIRE SURGERY

33:47.025 --> 33:48.797
ONLY TO CUT THE WRONG ONE?

33:48.797 --> 33:51.029
THIS WILL ALL HAVE BEEN
FOR NOTHING?
EXACTLY.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.203
BUT THANKS
FOR POINTING THAT OUT.

33:57.266 --> 33:59.268
(Arizona)
HOW MANY INCHES LEFT?

33:59.268 --> 34:01.110
UH, LESS THAN 2.

34:01.110 --> 34:04.143
SO IF I DO MY MATH,
WE GOT, UH,

34:04.143 --> 34:08.347
FOUR OR FIVE MORE HOURS AHEAD.
CRAP. OH, CRAP.
OH, CRAP. OH, CRAP.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.649
WHAT IS IT?
IT'S MY HAND.
IT'S CRAMPING. DAMN IT

34:10.649 --> 34:12.451
DON'T MOVE. DON'T MOVE.
AH.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.583
(monitor beeping erratically)
B.P.'s DROPPING.

34:14.583 --> 34:17.426
OKAY, WE'RE TOUCHING THE CORD.
IF WE DISTURB IT ANY MORE,

34:17.426 --> 34:21.160
WE RUN--
PULSE IS DOWN TO 52.

34:21.160 --> 34:24.062
IT'S GETTING WORSE, GUYS.
IT'S--
(Derek) EASY, EASY.
DON'T MOVE.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.765
EASY. DON'T MOVE.
JUST TAKE IT EASY.
OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
JUST STAY STILL.

34:26.765 --> 34:29.398
I'M--I'M GOING TO REACH IN.
(Jackson groans)

34:29.398 --> 34:31.400
HEY, CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND BREATHE.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.442
OKAY?
IT'S JUST A SPASM.

34:33.442 --> 34:35.504
(Arizona) B.P.'s BACK UP.
100 OVER 68.

34:35.504 --> 34:37.746
HAVE YOU HAD ANYTHING
TO DRINK TODAY, DR. AVERY?
WHAT?

34:37.746 --> 34:39.748
MUSCLE CRAMPS ARE A SIGN
OF DEHYDRATION.

34:39.748 --> 34:41.580
YOU WENT WITHOUT FLUIDS

34:41.580 --> 34:44.783
SO DR. GREY COULDN'T GET
HER HANDS ON THE RETRACTOR.

34:44.783 --> 34:48.287
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

34:48.287 --> 34:49.588
I, UH...

34:52.761 --> 34:54.323
SORRY.

34:54.323 --> 34:57.526
SORRY.
DON'T APOLOGIZE,
JUST STEP ASIDE.

34:57.526 --> 34:59.798
DR. GREY, TAKE OVER.

35:02.431 --> 35:05.334
EASY.

35:05.334 --> 35:06.635
GOT IT.
EASY.

35:06.635 --> 35:08.477
OKAY.

35:10.839 --> 35:13.442
HMM. "A" OR "B"?

35:13.442 --> 35:15.484
DR. GREY...

35:15.484 --> 35:17.616
"A" OR "B"?

35:17.616 --> 35:19.618
YOU'RE DONE?
YOU GOT IT ALL OUT?

35:19.618 --> 35:21.320
EXCEPT FOR THE BLIND CUT.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.323
I JUST HAVE TO PICK ONE,
AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.894
"A" OR "B"?

35:25.894 --> 35:27.796
YOU'RE KIDDING.

35:27.796 --> 35:30.559
YOU'RE STALLING.
DR. AVERY?

35:30.559 --> 35:33.432
I DON'T LIKE TO GAMBLE.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.833
DR. SLOAN?

35:34.833 --> 35:38.537
WHAT, SO YOU CAN BLAME IT ON ME
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

35:38.537 --> 35:40.509
THIS IS ALL YOU.
RIGHT. MY CALL.

35:40.509 --> 35:42.411
GREAT.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.653
HE'S DECIDING
WHICH ONE TO CUT.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.556
GUESSING WHICH ONE. THERE'S NO
LOGICAL WAY TO MAKE THAT CALL.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.488
I-I-I CAN'T--
I CAN'T LOOK. I...

35:59.488 --> 36:01.790
OH, MY GOD, MER,
THIS IS SO GOOD.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.465
EENY, MEENY, MINY, MOE.

36:06.465 --> 36:09.298
CATCH A TIGER BY ITS TOE.
IF HE HOLLERS--

36:09.298 --> 36:11.570
ARE YOU PLAYING
EENY, MEENY, MINY, MOE?

36:11.570 --> 36:12.871
(laughs) YEAH.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.443
NO. (laughs)

36:14.443 --> 36:16.445
YEAH. IT'S A BAD IDEA?

36:16.445 --> 36:18.407
(laughs)

36:18.407 --> 36:20.549
LET'S SEE.

36:20.549 --> 36:22.751
(exhales)

36:22.751 --> 36:24.483
(Derek) OKAY.

36:27.816 --> 36:31.590
OKAY.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.593
(Derek) ASK MOST SURGEONS
WHY THEY BECAME SURGEONS,

36:34.593 --> 36:36.925
THEY USUALLY TELL YOU
THE SAME THING--

36:36.925 --> 36:38.767
THE HIGH, THE RUSH,

36:38.767 --> 36:41.300
THE THRILL OF THE CUT.

36:41.300 --> 36:44.603
FOR ME, IT WAS THE QUIET.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.775
COME ON, SHEPHERD.
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

36:46.775 --> 36:48.637
Oh, my god.

36:48.637 --> 36:50.779
(whispers)
PLEASE DON'T BE WRONG.

36:50.779 --> 36:52.481
OKAY.

36:52.481 --> 36:53.742
(tool buzzes)

36:53.742 --> 36:56.485
(gasps) HE CUT.
HE MADE THE CUT.

36:56.485 --> 36:59.348
CRISTINA,
WAS IT THE RIGHT ONE?

36:59.348 --> 37:00.849
Cristina?

37:00.849 --> 37:03.322
TELL ME. CRISTINA?

37:10.759 --> 37:14.603
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

37:14.603 --> 37:16.965
(Isaac) NO, NO.

37:16.965 --> 37:19.568
NO.

37:19.568 --> 37:22.711
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO.

37:22.711 --> 37:24.573
(voice breaking) NO.

37:24.573 --> 37:26.575
ISAAC, WHAT IS IT?

37:26.575 --> 37:28.877
I CAN...

37:28.877 --> 37:31.850
I CAN MOVE MY TOES.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.755
IT DIDN'T WORK, DID IT?

37:36.755 --> 37:38.757
YOU COULDN'T DO IT?

37:38.757 --> 37:42.361
NO, NO.
WE GOT THE TUMOR.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.363
IT'S GONE.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.565
BUT I CAN MOVE MY TOES.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.567
YEAH, BECAUSE WE SAVED
THE CORD.

37:48.567 --> 37:51.039
IT WAS
A SUCCESSFUL SURGERY.

37:51.039 --> 37:53.502
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

37:58.447 --> 38:02.481
I KNEW YOU WOULD TRY, BUT...

38:02.481 --> 38:05.053
I'M GOING TO BE OKAY?

38:05.053 --> 38:06.585
YES.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.818
(laughs) I'M ACTUALLY
GOING TO BE OKAY?

38:09.818 --> 38:13.322
YES.
(laughing)

38:13.322 --> 38:15.494
(sniffles)

38:15.494 --> 38:18.497
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, DEREK.

38:18.497 --> 38:21.670
YOU'RE A VERY GOOD MAN.

38:21.670 --> 38:23.432
PEACE...

38:23.432 --> 38:27.376
ISN'T A PERMANENT STATE.

38:27.376 --> 38:30.479
IT EXISTS IN MOMENTS...

38:30.479 --> 38:32.581
FLEETING...

38:32.581 --> 38:36.044
GONE BEFORE WE EVEN KNEW
IT WAS THERE.

38:38.517 --> 38:40.519
SHEPHERD FINISHED
THE SURGERY.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.651
AND I TOOK CARE
OF ALL THE PRE-OPS.

38:42.651 --> 38:45.454
