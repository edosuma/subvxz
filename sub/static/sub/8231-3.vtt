WEBVTT

00:09.567 --> 00:11.267
- I'll admit it, guys.
We suck at chicks.

00:11.267 --> 00:13.833
- Yeah, man, 24 weeks
since we've kissed girls,

00:13.833 --> 00:14.933
besides our moms.

00:14.933 --> 00:16.233
- Okay, I was gonna say.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.800
- We got to do something
this weekend,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.467
or else I'm gonna
donate my dick to science.

00:19.467 --> 00:20.900
- What we should do, really,

00:20.900 --> 00:23.100
is we should be
like those dudes on YouTube

00:23.100 --> 00:24.833
that, like, see hot chicks,

00:24.833 --> 00:27.333
and then they just go up to
them and just freaking scope

00:27.333 --> 00:29.567
'em out and say, "You're hot."
Smooch 'em.

00:29.567 --> 00:31.067
- Love those guys.
- Surprise smooch.

00:31.067 --> 00:32.633
You know,
they're caught off guard,

00:32.633 --> 00:34.333
but they like it because it
was an aggressive kiss,

00:34.333 --> 00:35.967
but it was done
in a tasteful fashion.

00:35.967 --> 00:38.400
- Aggressive kissing,
like Harrison Ford-style.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.433
- So you go that route.
I think I'm gonna class it up,

00:40.433 --> 00:42.800
probably get into wine,
so that hopefully, I can dine,

00:42.800 --> 00:44.667
and--fingers crossed--69.
- Good angle, Ders.

00:44.667 --> 00:47.167
- Come here.
You want some sandwich?

00:47.167 --> 00:48.967
I bet you're used to eating
garbage all day. Come here.

00:48.967 --> 00:51.000
- Oh, God, Jillian's
dumpster-talking again.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.800
- Okay.
- Jillian, hey!

00:52.800 --> 00:54.400
Step away from the dumpster,

00:54.400 --> 00:56.433
and let's go on inside
and talk to real people, okay?

00:56.433 --> 00:58.333
- No, no, no, there's
a little kitty cat in here.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.600
- You're talking to dumpsters.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.900
It's no big whoop, right?

01:00.900 --> 01:02.500
We're all a little crazy.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.067
- No, I'm not crazy.
There's a cat in there.

01:04.067 --> 01:05.133
Oh, come on.
- Come on.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.900
- I scared her.
- Just get down.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.067
- She's in there.
Come here, kitty!

01:08.067 --> 01:09.600
- Sad.
- Nothing's there.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.700
- I'll help.
- Sure, yeah.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.433
- Come here!
- Jillian, stop.

01:12.433 --> 01:13.933
- Come here, little one.
- It's wet. It's wet trash.

01:13.933 --> 01:15.067
- Oh, gross.
- It doesn't smell great.

01:15.067 --> 01:17.233
- Oh, there you are!
See?

01:17.233 --> 01:19.533
I told you I wasn't crazy.
[laughs]

01:19.533 --> 01:21.800
[cat growls]
- Ow, ow, ow!

- Right?

01:35.467 --> 01:38.233
- It is a cute little baby
kitty cat, isn't it?

01:38.233 --> 01:39.633
- She's special.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.067
I mean,
she's a little dirty,

01:41.067 --> 01:42.533
so you can't really
see her pussy,

01:42.533 --> 01:43.767
but we'll take care
of that, right?

01:43.767 --> 01:45.067
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, on that note,

01:45.067 --> 01:46.700
I'm gonna walk away
and avoid any kind

01:46.700 --> 01:50.067
of responsibility for that
bootleg-ass Heathcliff. Bye.

01:50.067 --> 01:53.767
- He should've said, uh,
Garfield.

01:53.767 --> 01:56.200
- [chuckles]
Why?

01:56.200 --> 01:58.367
- Well, 'cause he's also a cat.
- Sure.

01:58.367 --> 02:00.600
- So I should've left
when Ders left, actually, so...

02:00.600 --> 02:02.800
- Yeah, probably.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.700
- See ya.

Ahh.

What should we name you?

What should we name you?

How about Dumpster?

02:10.333 --> 02:11.900
- Ooh, what about Bonnie?

02:11.900 --> 02:14.733
My aunt had a large-chested
friend named Bonnie,

02:14.733 --> 02:15.933
who I was always very fond of.

02:15.933 --> 02:17.767
- Classic.
- Yes.

02:17.767 --> 02:19.767
- What about Chastity?

02:19.767 --> 02:22.867
Nah, this cat [bleep].
- Yes.

02:22.867 --> 02:25.533
Well, my brain is fried,

02:25.533 --> 02:27.500
and I'm starving.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.933
- Me too.

02:28.933 --> 02:30.233
I could go for some...

02:30.233 --> 02:32.533
both: Denny's.

[cat meows]

02:33.667 --> 02:35.267
Denny's?

02:35.267 --> 02:36.767
- Denny's,
that's what we'll call you.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.200
- Hi, Denny's.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.667
- Our little cat, Denny's.

02:40.667 --> 02:43.433
- Oh, dude, check it out.

02:43.433 --> 02:45.400
- Meth.
Okay, we're doing it.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.867
- No.
- I'm actually kind of excited.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.600
I've always wanted
to--to have a taste.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.267
But I don't want
to lose me to it.

02:50.267 --> 02:52.933
- What? No, dude, this
is wine--wine aerator, right?

02:52.933 --> 02:55.667
But, like, I put like seven of
them in the whole thing, so,

02:55.667 --> 02:58.600
like, basically,
it gets super aerated.

02:58.600 --> 03:03.067
That way, the classy chicks we
bring back here to drink it,

03:03.067 --> 03:04.833
they'll be drippin'
for a sippin'.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.567
- They're probably gonna be
warmed up from my aggressive

03:06.567 --> 03:07.733
surprise kisses.
- Exactly.

03:07.733 --> 03:09.067
- Right?
- Hey, guys.

03:09.067 --> 03:10.200
You got it?
- Uh-oh.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.333
Hey, ho, cat in the dog house.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.800
Check it out. Yeah.
- Wow.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.567
- What's that big, dumb,
stupid thing?

03:15.567 --> 03:17.233
- Mommy made a--
made a cat tower.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.400
- Yeah, and we've decided
that this is officially

03:19.400 --> 03:21.567
Denny's home, so you'll be
seeing a lot more of me.

03:21.567 --> 03:23.067
Where are the keys?

03:23.067 --> 03:25.067
- I don't know
how to feel about that.

03:25.067 --> 03:27.067
But beer for my buddy.

03:27.067 --> 03:28.900
- Oh, thanks, dude.
- Hit that there.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.533
- Pipe it up with my amigos.

03:30.533 --> 03:33.233
- Oh, wow, does Daddy
think it's a good idea

03:33.233 --> 03:35.333
to smoke in front of Denny's?

03:35.333 --> 03:37.667
- Uh, yeah, actually,
you know what?

03:37.667 --> 03:39.167
I'm good off that.
- For real?

03:39.167 --> 03:42.400
- Yeah, I'm gonna pass
on grass tonight.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.333
- We are gonna go out though,
right?

03:44.333 --> 03:47.233
- Right?
- Right.

03:47.233 --> 03:50.300
You don't care, right?

03:50.300 --> 03:51.867
- Oh, me?

03:51.867 --> 03:55.500
No, go have fun with
Unkie Adam and Unkie Ders.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.733
- Unkie Adam, Unkie Ders.
I like that.

03:56.733 --> 03:58.300
- Yeah, all right!
- All right!

03:58.300 --> 04:00.067
- Bye-bye, cat.
Meow!

04:00.067 --> 04:01.600
- I need this.
- Meow!

04:01.600 --> 04:02.600
Bye.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.367
- Bye, cat!

04:04.367 --> 04:05.700
- All right, bye, sweetie.

04:05.700 --> 04:06.900
Okay, sweet dreams.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.300
You have fun with Mommy,
all right?

04:08.300 --> 04:09.467
- Be good.
- Hey.

04:09.467 --> 04:11.067
[mouths silently]

04:14.067 --> 04:16.067
- Oh, let's do this.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.533
Pardon me.
- Oh, and excuse me.

04:17.533 --> 04:19.800
- Hello, bartender,

04:19.800 --> 04:22.267
I would like a glass
of your smoothest red wine.

04:22.267 --> 04:24.167
- How about a Cab'?

04:24.167 --> 04:26.800
- Uh, I just got here
in my own car,

04:26.800 --> 04:29.333
so I'll pass on the taxi
and take that red wine, thanks.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.400
You believe this prick?
Crazy, right?

04:37.300 --> 04:39.067
- Yeah.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.600
- What's up?
- No.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.100
- I find you attractive.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.833
I do, and that's just a fact.

04:44.833 --> 04:45.933
Do you find me attractive?

04:45.933 --> 04:47.533
- Nope.

04:47.533 --> 04:49.067
- Surprise kiss.

04:49.067 --> 04:51.100
Ow!
I think you broke my nose.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.433
- Okay.

04:53.433 --> 04:56.167
- But I think, uh, if you guys
tasted a little wine,

04:56.167 --> 04:58.100
you might be--okay, all right.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.533
Dude, any luck?

04:59.533 --> 05:01.267
- No, zero.

05:01.267 --> 05:04.100
- Yeah, they're definitely
not a classy crowd.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.767
- Look at this.

05:06.767 --> 05:09.267
Oh, my, that dirty dog.
- What?

05:09.267 --> 05:11.400
- Then I pull out
her little can of cat food,

05:11.400 --> 05:13.333
and she makes this face at me.

05:13.333 --> 05:15.167
Aah!
[laughs]

05:15.167 --> 05:17.067
[women whimper]
Yeah, I know.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.233
And I'm like,
"Did I rescue her,

05:19.233 --> 05:21.100
or did she rescue me?"
You know?

05:21.100 --> 05:23.333
- Aw, yeah.
- That's so philosophical.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.833
- She has the sweetest
little face.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.467
- Doesn't she?
- That goofy tongue

05:27.467 --> 05:29.100
isn't the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.400
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.100
- Watch out.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.400
I'm about to aggressively kiss
a girl by surprise.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.967
- Wait, no, no,
hang on, hang on.

05:35.967 --> 05:37.567
- I'm in love, yeah.
- That's adorable.

05:37.567 --> 05:39.167
- Hey, well, if you guys
want to meet that darn cat,

05:39.167 --> 05:40.500
why don't you just
come back to our place?

05:40.500 --> 05:42.667
We're his roommates.
- Really?

05:42.667 --> 05:45.767
- Uh...yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:45.767 --> 05:47.400
Heck, yeah.
Sure, we could--

05:47.400 --> 05:48.867
we could probably wake her up
and say hi.

05:48.867 --> 05:50.933
Sure, yeah,
we could wake her up,

05:50.933 --> 05:53.067
say hi, right now.
- Very cool.

05:53.067 --> 05:55.067
- Welcome to my house.

05:55.067 --> 05:57.267
- Hey, look at the time.
It's already wine:30.

05:57.267 --> 05:58.933
[laughter]
- Wine:30.

05:58.933 --> 06:01.433
- You guys are just, I'd say,
about eight minutes away

06:01.433 --> 06:05.900
from drinking the smoothest
2014 Brosé Mangria you ever had.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.800
Here we go.
- Oh, look at it go!

06:08.800 --> 06:10.300
- Right?
- Where's that cat?

06:10.300 --> 06:12.067
I'm not dying
to meet it or anything.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.167
- Can we wake her up?
- Um...

06:14.167 --> 06:15.867
- It's a miracle
you haven't already.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.900
- Jillian.
Hey, Mommy.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.667
- Don't you "Hey, Mommy" me,
Daddy,

06:19.667 --> 06:21.533
barging in here
with these whores

06:21.533 --> 06:24.067
like the beginning
of some crude stag film,

06:24.067 --> 06:26.067
just ten feet away
from where your cat sleeps!

06:26.067 --> 06:27.900
- Okay.
- Oh, hey, hey!

06:27.900 --> 06:30.467
We heard all about Denny's and
we just wanted to meet her.

06:30.467 --> 06:32.067
- [mocking accent] Oh, did you?
- Yeah.

06:32.067 --> 06:33.500
- [mocking accent]
Did you hear about Denny's?

06:33.500 --> 06:34.833
[normal voice]
Do you have any cats? No.

06:34.833 --> 06:36.833
- I--
- No, I didn't think so.

06:36.833 --> 06:38.400
Because if you did, you
wouldn't be dressed like sluts

06:38.400 --> 06:40.333
and following home strange men
to pound Mangria.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.067
Blake, can I see you
in the kitchen for a moment?

06:42.067 --> 06:44.400
- Mm-hmm, yup.
- We're not strange.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.700
- Yeah,
we're very non-strange.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.200
- By the way,
we are just minutes away

06:47.200 --> 06:49.133
from the Mangria, ladies.

06:49.133 --> 06:51.633
- Yeah, so, you know,
we didn't wake her up.

06:51.633 --> 06:53.300
And I didn't think
it was that--

06:53.300 --> 06:55.367
- Yeah, that's right, Blake,
you didn't think.

06:55.367 --> 06:57.500
Denny's was left for dead
in a dumpster,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.567
and you didn't think
that maybe you shouldn't

06:59.567 --> 07:02.367
abandon her on the first night
of being her daddy?

07:02.367 --> 07:05.067
- Hey, I mean,
I just figured, you know,

07:05.067 --> 07:06.200
you're such a good mommy--

07:06.200 --> 07:07.933
- Don't you patronize me!

07:07.933 --> 07:09.933
- Okay,
how would I patronize you

07:09.933 --> 07:12.667
when I don't even know
what that means?

07:12.667 --> 07:15.367
Okay?
[stammers]

07:15.367 --> 07:17.067
What do you want from me?

07:17.067 --> 07:19.300
- I want you to be
a good daddy,

07:19.300 --> 07:22.067
not some whore-mongering
night owl!

07:22.067 --> 07:24.067
- Hey!
All right, at least those...

07:24.067 --> 07:27.467
[softly] whores...
aren't crazy!

07:27.467 --> 07:29.200
- Oh! Oh, that's right!

07:29.200 --> 07:30.933
Because I am crazy, right?
- Oh, yeah!

07:30.933 --> 07:32.433
- Okay, yeah, 'cause I'm crazy.

07:32.433 --> 07:33.967
You know what?
- Yeah, oh, what you gonna do?

07:33.967 --> 07:35.333
- I'll show you crazy!
- Oh, yeah!

07:35.333 --> 07:37.100
- Denny's needs her dad!
- No, no, no!

07:37.100 --> 07:38.767
Throw 'em all over the place,
Jillian!

07:38.767 --> 07:41.500
- Denny's needs her dad!
- You fricking psycho!

07:41.500 --> 07:43.867
Don't you throw
the nice plastic plates!

07:43.867 --> 07:45.633
- Denny's!
Because she needs one!

07:45.633 --> 07:48.467
- There's one
from Anders's birthday! Okay?

07:48.467 --> 07:49.767
- Ohh!
- No, let me help ya!

07:49.767 --> 07:50.767
Let me help ya!
- You want to help me?

07:50.767 --> 07:52.067
That's fine!

07:52.067 --> 07:53.533
- Just throw 'em
all over the place,

07:53.533 --> 07:56.467
'cause I work
at a goddamned dead-end job!

07:56.467 --> 08:00.567
I got the shortest straw,
didn't I, when I got you?

08:00.567 --> 08:02.733
You're throwing plates!

08:02.733 --> 08:05.667
[cat meows]
- She's awake now. Denny's!

08:05.667 --> 08:07.667
- Oh, come on!
- Denny's!

08:07.667 --> 08:09.500
- Oh, come on!

08:09.500 --> 08:10.633
- Uh, we should go.

08:10.633 --> 08:11.967
- Wait, no, no, guys, just,

08:11.967 --> 08:12.967
like, five more minutes
on the wine.

08:12.967 --> 08:14.133
- Surprise kiss!
- Aah!

08:14.133 --> 08:16.467
You--God!
- Oh, [bleep].

08:16.467 --> 08:18.833
- All right, see ya at the bar,
maybe, next time.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.467
- Too aggressive?

08:20.467 --> 08:22.067
- I don't think so.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.067
- That's my point.
You're never here.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.467
- Oh, come on!

08:24.467 --> 08:26.100
I have one cat,

08:26.100 --> 08:27.933
and now I can't leave
the fricking house?

08:27.933 --> 08:30.267
You wanna know how many dinners
I had with my pops?

08:30.267 --> 08:34.267
Nada, zero, zilch,
nothing, okay?

08:34.267 --> 08:37.600
And I didn't turn out
to be a--any, uh, degenerate.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.933
- Keep telling yourself that,
Blake.

08:39.933 --> 08:41.400
Say good-bye to Daddy.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.467
- Fine, go!

08:43.467 --> 08:46.800
I don't care, actually,
at all!

08:46.800 --> 08:48.633
[voice breaking]
Oh, God.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.267
Oh, great, great.

08:50.267 --> 08:52.267
- You know what?
Forget about that cat, okay?

08:52.267 --> 08:55.067
- No, actually,
don't forget about it,

08:55.067 --> 08:58.567
because you are its daddy
and it is a little baby.

08:58.567 --> 09:00.233
So go fricking save
your baby, Blake.

09:00.233 --> 09:01.867
Go.
- Mm-hmm, okay.

09:01.867 --> 09:03.367
- Go save the baby.
- All right, yeah. Hell, yeah.

09:03.367 --> 09:04.867
- What are you doing?
This cat is problems.

09:04.867 --> 09:06.167
It's trouble.
- What is wrong with you?

09:06.167 --> 09:07.967
You almost blew it.

09:07.967 --> 09:10.700
The only reason that we had
those chicks over at our house

09:10.700 --> 09:12.933
was that cat
'cause chicks love animals.

09:12.933 --> 09:14.800
They love animals
even more than they love

09:14.800 --> 09:16.233
surprise kisses.
- Mm-hmm.

09:16.233 --> 09:18.067
- So this is the angle,
right?

09:18.067 --> 09:19.367
- Yeah, okay.

09:19.367 --> 09:21.700
- So last night,
I was drunk.

09:21.700 --> 09:23.367
I said some things.

09:23.367 --> 09:26.300
It was stupid.
I didn't mean it, all right?

09:26.300 --> 09:28.100
- I don't hate you, Blake.
- Okay.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.733
- And I don't want
Denny's to hate you,

09:29.733 --> 09:31.800
which is why I think
we should do a joint custody.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.900
I get her on the weekdays.
You get the weekends.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.267
- Yes.
- Great.

09:35.267 --> 09:37.633
- Um, but actually,
it's Friday,

09:37.633 --> 09:39.133
so that's kind of,
like, technically,

09:39.133 --> 09:40.533
the start of the weekend.

09:40.533 --> 09:41.800
- I didn't think about that.
- Yeah.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.133
- Here's her stuff.

09:43.133 --> 09:44.633
These are her toys.
- Yeah.

09:44.633 --> 09:46.967
- And this is her catnip.
- I know.

09:46.967 --> 09:48.767
- Carry it around at all times.
- Yeah.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.867
- Oh, and she only eats
off of a frisbee.

09:50.867 --> 09:53.367
It's the craziest thing.
- Yeah, I know!

09:53.367 --> 09:55.900
Okay, I-I know. I know
she eats off a frisbee, yes.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.067
I know my--

09:57.067 --> 09:59.067
- Everything okay here?
- Yeah.

09:59.067 --> 10:01.033
- Everything's cool, Bill.
Thanks.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.367
Yeah, she's with Daddy now,

10:02.367 --> 10:04.100
and I know how to take care
of her.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.567
- Bye, Daddy.

10:05.567 --> 10:08.767
Ow!
Gosh, you got a nerve.

10:08.767 --> 10:10.300
No, go harder.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.800
Work it out, betch.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.667
*

10:17.300 --> 10:21.500
*

10:21.500 --> 10:22.833
- Welcome to our house.
Come on inside.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.367
- Hey. Wine is inside.

10:24.367 --> 10:27.367
Okay, this party is popping.
What's going on?

10:27.367 --> 10:29.300
- Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.433
Way more people
than I was expecting.

10:31.433 --> 10:33.000
- I don't know.
both: Hey.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.867
- Where's the free cocaine
from the flyer?

10:34.867 --> 10:36.933
- Wow, weird. "Free cocaine"?
It does say that.

10:36.933 --> 10:38.300
That is weird.
I've never seen this before.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.167
I don't know anything
about that.

10:40.167 --> 10:42.367
But I do know that there's
about to be a falcon debut

10:42.367 --> 10:43.900
happening in a few.
- That is true.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.400
- I'm a falconer,
so that's exciting.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.067
- Hmm, I'm sorry
to be a wet blanket here.

10:48.067 --> 10:50.833
Uh, I don't know if this is
the best environment

10:50.833 --> 10:52.833
to be raising a cat.

10:52.833 --> 10:55.700
- Denny's is a chick magnet,
just like my falcon

10:55.700 --> 10:57.400
is about to be a chick magnet.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.267
Ders, you better get
a bunny wabbit or something,

10:59.267 --> 11:00.967
or you're gonna be
sniffing on butt steaks.

11:00.967 --> 11:03.167
- I wouldn't worry
about me, guys.

11:03.167 --> 11:04.567
I think I'm gonna
have some dumb girl

11:04.567 --> 11:06.167
wrapped around my pinky
in no time.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.967
- Ooh-hoo.
- Because,

11:07.967 --> 11:11.067
while you guys are fighting
over some animal-lover girls,

11:11.067 --> 11:14.300
I'm gonna track down me
a little animal hater.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.633
[cat meows]
- That's right.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.167
I'm calling it
"counter ho-gramming."

11:17.167 --> 11:18.900
- That is hella good angle,

11:18.900 --> 11:20.500
and I want to congratulate you

11:20.500 --> 11:22.100
and wish you the best of luck,
in all seriousness.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.667
- Thank you. Boom and hello.
- Mwah.

11:23.667 --> 11:25.567
- Mwah-ah-uh-uh.

11:25.567 --> 11:26.933
- You know, I don't like
that we still do that.

11:26.933 --> 11:27.967
- Yeah, we don't have
to do that.

11:27.967 --> 11:29.167
- Yeah, we don't have to.

11:29.167 --> 11:31.833
- Whoa, nice shot, sista.

11:31.833 --> 11:34.267
Hey, what do you guys say
we liven this game up,

11:34.267 --> 11:37.433
drop in a real, live gerbil,
kill it?

11:37.433 --> 11:42.133
Right?
Spinnies! [chuckles]

11:42.133 --> 11:43.900
No?
Okay.

11:43.900 --> 11:45.567
Well, be sure and try
the Mangria.

11:45.567 --> 11:47.233
It's pretty tasty.

11:47.233 --> 11:50.400
- Hey,
that wasn't such a bad idea.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.200
The gerbil.
- Oh. Oh!

11:52.200 --> 11:53.867
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
thanks.

11:53.867 --> 11:54.900
That was--you thought
it was pretty funny?

11:54.900 --> 11:56.200
- I thought it was hilarious.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.700
I love terrorizing animals.
- Ooh.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.567
- Do you want to come back
to my place?

12:00.567 --> 12:02.133
I've got a couple
of tied-down raccoons

12:02.133 --> 12:04.600
that we can bash in
with hammers...

12:04.600 --> 12:06.633
unless you're a knife guy.
- Uh...

12:06.633 --> 12:08.967
- Oh, you're a knife guy.
I knew it.

12:08.967 --> 12:11.933
Oh, just do me already.
- I want to.

12:11.933 --> 12:15.567
- Hear ye, hear ye,
animal lovers!

12:15.567 --> 12:21.467
Prepare yourself for the debut
of my pet falcon!

12:21.467 --> 12:23.467
Okay, cool, you're listening.

12:23.467 --> 12:25.767
I love animals.

12:25.767 --> 12:27.600
They mean so much to me.

12:27.600 --> 12:32.533
So I would like to introduce
to all of you my beloved...

12:34.733 --> 12:36.533
Beth!

12:36.533 --> 12:38.933
Real falcon.
I just--I Amazon Primed her.

12:38.933 --> 12:40.900
Turns out you can get--
get animals on there.

12:40.900 --> 12:44.867
For Beth's first trick, she
shall fly through the kitchen,

12:44.867 --> 12:47.333
back to me, her master,

12:47.333 --> 12:50.933
Adam "the Animal Lover" DeMamp.

12:50.933 --> 12:52.800
- Fly, Beth! Fly!
[falcon screeches]

12:52.800 --> 12:55.200
- Oh! Okay.
[crowd gasps]

12:55.200 --> 12:57.433
So now she's--she'll be fine.
She's gonna come back.

12:57.433 --> 12:58.633
Did she poop on you?

12:58.633 --> 13:00.433
Uh, that--that's okay.

13:00.433 --> 13:02.267
I trained her to do such.

13:02.267 --> 13:04.067
Beth?

13:04.067 --> 13:07.067
Ca-caw!
Ca-caw!

13:07.067 --> 13:08.533
- Den--Denny's?

13:08.533 --> 13:09.933
- That's really cool.
That's awesome.

13:09.933 --> 13:11.500
- I went to Tanzania
last summer.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.833
- Oh, wow.
- And I shot a rhino,

13:12.833 --> 13:14.700
and I sawed its horn off.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.100
God, it was so hot.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.567
- Yeah.

13:17.567 --> 13:19.767
- I still have the horn.

13:19.767 --> 13:21.867
I'd love to peg you with it.
- Oh...

13:21.867 --> 13:23.367
- But first I wanna
kill something

13:23.367 --> 13:25.333
and get really hot,
you know?

13:25.333 --> 13:26.833
- Yeah, oh, of course I know.

13:26.833 --> 13:30.400
One time,
I spit on this pigeon's face,

13:30.400 --> 13:32.067
and then I got
a little boner--

13:32.067 --> 13:33.900
big boner--pretty big boner.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.267
- Ooh, I know.

13:35.267 --> 13:36.833
Let's kill your friend's cat.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.533
- Oh, Denny's?
Oh--I--whoa.

13:38.533 --> 13:40.667
- I'll go get you a knife,
Knife Guy.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.333
And you just get ready
to give me that lap dagger.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.500
- Ooh!
- I'm talking about your dick.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.567
- Yeah, I know.
I know. You grabbed it.

13:48.567 --> 13:50.100
- Excuse me,
I have a baby coming through.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.333
Excuse me.

13:51.333 --> 13:54.100
Okay, just put you right to bed.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.933
Oh, you had me worried sick.

13:55.933 --> 13:58.133
This party's a little
too crazy, huh?

13:58.133 --> 14:00.400
Oh, no, no, no, no weed.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.667
Here you go, here.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.167
Yeah, have your catnip, okay?

14:03.167 --> 14:05.200
Daddy's gonna go party,
all right?

14:05.200 --> 14:07.133
He's gonna go get twisted!

14:07.133 --> 14:11.400
Okay, oh, my gosh,
I am ready to party.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.567
- Serve my man up with some
of that indo, my dude.

14:13.567 --> 14:15.467
- Oh, I need it.

14:15.467 --> 14:19.067
I'm stressing.
- I thought I was your man?

14:19.067 --> 14:21.833
- No, you're my dude.
Blake's my man.

14:21.833 --> 14:24.133
- [coughs]

14:24.133 --> 14:25.500
Dude.
- Sticky, right?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.067
- What the hell is this, man?

14:27.067 --> 14:29.367
It tastes like Swamp Thing's
dingleberries.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.567
- Really?
I kind of like it.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.300
Whatever, it was free.
It was just sitting there, so...

14:33.300 --> 14:35.067
- Huh?
No!

14:35.067 --> 14:37.900
- Finders keepers,
losers weepers.

14:37.900 --> 14:41.467
- Adam, this is, um...
this is catnip.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.100
- That's like the weed name?
Like a--

14:43.100 --> 14:45.400
- No, I think
it's actual catnip.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.133
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

14:49.133 --> 14:52.067
No! No!

14:52.067 --> 14:53.800
- [gasps]
[cat groans]

14:53.800 --> 14:54.867
[screams]

14:54.867 --> 14:59.067
*

15:02.067 --> 15:04.467
*

15:06.533 --> 15:07.567
- Where are they?
- They're right there.

15:07.567 --> 15:09.267
- Where are they?

15:09.267 --> 15:10.600
- And it's not all Blake's
fault, by the way.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.767
- Wait, are you boinking Bill?

15:13.767 --> 15:16.233
- Grow up.
[whispers] Yes.

15:16.233 --> 15:18.733
- She's alive, barely.

15:18.733 --> 15:20.800
Everybody, please back up.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.067
I said get back, get back,
get back, get back, get back!

15:23.067 --> 15:26.233
Go! Go!
Butts to the wall!

15:26.233 --> 15:29.833
Dear Lord,
bless these fingers once more.

15:29.833 --> 15:32.833
[dramatic music]

15:32.833 --> 15:34.900
*

15:34.900 --> 15:36.333
[cat retches]
- Whoa!

15:36.333 --> 15:37.467
- Whoa.
- Ew!

15:37.467 --> 15:38.900
- There's my girl.
- Dude.

15:38.900 --> 15:41.067
- There she is.
Old-fashioned stomach pump.

15:41.067 --> 15:42.633
- You're nasty.
- [laughs]

15:42.633 --> 15:44.267
Oh, thank God,
Denny's, you're all right.

15:44.267 --> 15:46.067
- You get back, Blake!
- Whoa!

15:46.067 --> 15:48.333
- [sniffs]

15:48.333 --> 15:49.500
Are you high right now?

15:49.500 --> 15:51.067
- No, no, no, no, no.

15:51.067 --> 15:53.100
You're smelling catnip.
I smoked, uh, catnip.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.067
I can't feel nothing.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.800
- That cannot be true.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.067
I'm smoking it right now,
and I am...

- And this asshole
hates animals.

16:04.467 --> 16:07.133
- [Ders on recording] One time,
I spit on this pigeon's face,

16:07.133 --> 16:09.133
and then I got a little boner.

16:09.133 --> 16:10.800
[all gasp]
- No, I didn't! I didn't!

16:10.800 --> 16:12.700
It was a big boner.
I don't have a little boner.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.300
So that's how you know
it didn't happen.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.800
- Did your "counter ho-gramming"
go as planned,

16:16.800 --> 16:18.600
you chauvinist pig?

16:18.600 --> 16:20.067
Asshole!

16:20.067 --> 16:22.767
This party sucks.
- So you were never--

16:22.767 --> 16:24.867
- This is who you
surround my kitty with?

16:24.867 --> 16:27.300

and a pigeon-[bleep]?

16:27.300 --> 16:28.600
- Did you [bleep] a pigeon?

16:28.600 --> 16:32.067
- You will never see
her again, Blake.

16:32.067 --> 16:33.567
Say good-bye to Daddy.

16:33.567 --> 16:34.600
- Oh, wait.
Hold up.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.233
- Bill, warm up the car.

16:36.233 --> 16:38.233
- What else you want me
to warm up?

16:38.233 --> 16:39.867
We talk like that now.
- Come on, wait.

16:39.867 --> 16:42.133
- Nice, dude.
- Hold up. Ders, what?

16:42.133 --> 16:44.100
- No, I didn't--why--
no, I spit.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.400
- Jillian!
Hey, hey, no, no, no, no.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.767
You can't do this.

16:46.767 --> 16:48.467
Like, legally,
you can't do that.

16:48.467 --> 16:50.900
- Oh, really? You want me
to call the cops, Blake?

16:50.900 --> 16:53.567
Is that what you want?
- No, what--we don't snitch.

16:53.567 --> 16:55.933
- Look, Blake,
you're a good guy,

16:55.933 --> 16:58.533
but you're a [bleep] daddy.

16:58.533 --> 17:00.333
[cat meows softly]
- I know, honey.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.800
Come on, Bill.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.167
- Hey, man, forget her.
Forget the cat, right?

17:04.167 --> 17:07.067
Why don't we go inside,
work some angles,

That's cigarette butts.

17:25.067 --> 17:26.200

- Nah, I'm okay.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.067
- Your loss.

17:28.067 --> 17:30.200
Oh, that looks like a really
good year red, doesn't it?

17:30.200 --> 17:33.500
Huh? Huh?
Yeah!

17:33.500 --> 17:36.233
- Hey, you broke my aerator.
- Now we're having fun!

17:36.233 --> 17:38.233
Come on!
Turn the music up, bud!

17:55.333 --> 17:57.100
we're gonna
get your cat Denny's back.

17:57.100 --> 18:00.933
- Yeah, and not because it
was a total pussy magnet,

18:00.933 --> 18:02.433
which it was.
- Totally.

18:02.433 --> 18:04.733
- But because you loved it.
- Yeah.

18:04.733 --> 18:06.400
- Daddy.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.267
- Actually, it's kind of creepy
when you say it.

18:09.267 --> 18:10.667
- Okay, so here's the deal.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.467
We go in, we grab Denny's,
and then,

18:12.467 --> 18:15.133
when she grows up to be, like,
a lion or a tiger or a liger

18:15.133 --> 18:16.700
or whatever she is,
she'll be all yours, right?

18:16.700 --> 18:18.300
- That's not how cats work,
but yes.

18:18.300 --> 18:19.367
He's right.
- Really?

18:19.367 --> 18:20.733
- Also, we're gonna make it

18:20.733 --> 18:22.233
look like she just ran away,
all right?

I appreciate it.

Shh.

that I'm a bad daddy.

- I'm also a bad mommy.

- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.700
That's--that's not true
at all.

19:22.700 --> 19:25.467
- Uh-huh. It is true.
- No, no, no.

19:25.467 --> 19:28.400
- After I left your house
on Friday with Denny's,

19:28.400 --> 19:31.067
I was driving and texting.

19:31.067 --> 19:32.467
- That's okay.
- Yeah.

19:32.467 --> 19:34.200
- I ran a stoplight,
slammed on the brakes,

19:34.200 --> 19:35.567
and Denny's flew
into the windshield.

19:35.567 --> 19:38.067
Wham!
Died on impact.

19:39.567 --> 19:40.967
- Wait, so she was dead?

19:40.967 --> 19:43.433
Or is--she is--
she is currently dead?

19:43.433 --> 19:44.800
That's good to know.
Okay.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.600
- But that's not all.

to bury in the morning.

of the night,

19:49.600 --> 19:51.267

about Dustin Diamond.

I got a good look at it,

19:56.333 --> 19:58.467
but then I found paw prints
outside my apartment,

19:58.467 --> 19:59.767
and it was then that I knew.

- Hmm.

- Wait, knew what?
- Duh.

had broken into my apartment

20:05.667 --> 20:07.033

- There's literally
no other possibility.

like, my pet hawk or anything.
