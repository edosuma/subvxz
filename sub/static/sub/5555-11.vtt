[Gasping]

00:55.103 --> 00:57.467

- Oh, my lord. [Laughs]

Castle: Somewhere in one of these bags

00:59.172 --> 01:02.051
is the perfect baby shower
gift for Jen and Ryan.

01:02.082 --> 01:04.007
I just need your help picking which one.

01:04.043 --> 01:06.009
Ready?

01:06.044 --> 01:07.911
Ta-da!

01:07.946 --> 01:10.246
- No.
- Is that a bulletproof baby ve...

01:10.282 --> 01:12.215
- It's completely inappropriate.
- Really?

01:12.250 --> 01:13.506
- Oh, my... so wrong.
- Okay.

01:13.580 --> 01:15.718
Well, then, you're gonna hate the onesies
that say "I'm with Officer Stupid."

01:15.753 --> 01:17.887
Richard, I... honestly.

01:17.923 --> 01:20.256
Why can't you just buy
a simple tradition...

01:20.292 --> 01:21.924
Why is that so difficult for you?

01:21.959 --> 01:25.093
It's not. This next one <i> is</i> perfect.

01:25.129 --> 01:26.194
- Trust me.
- Okay.

01:26.230 --> 01:28.002
Is it a baby-sized lightsaber?

01:28.171 --> 01:29.898
[Chuckling] No.

01:29.934 --> 01:32.000
Please tell me that's not
the creepy robot nanny

01:32.036 --> 01:33.268
that sings Leonard Cohen lullabies.

01:33.304 --> 01:35.237
What's wrong with Leonard Cohen lullabies?

01:35.272 --> 01:36.838
It's more like "Silence of the Lambs"

01:36.873 --> 01:38.340
than "Mary had a little lamb."

01:38.375 --> 01:40.007
Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.

01:40.043 --> 01:41.345
Fortunately,

01:41.419 --> 01:45.112
Alexis has purchased the
perfect baby shower gift.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.926
All you have to do is sign the card.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.951
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to find machine-washable kevlar?

01:49.986 --> 01:51.618
Why didn't you tell me this
before I went shopping?

01:51.654 --> 01:54.621
Because we would have
so missed torturing you.

01:54.657 --> 01:57.223
You are our favorite reality show.

01:57.259 --> 01:59.451
I'm so happy I could entertain you.

01:59.619 --> 02:00.327
Thank you, Alexis.

02:00.362 --> 02:02.395
I will drop this off at the
precinct a little later.

02:02.431 --> 02:04.197
Too bad you can't go to the shower.

02:04.232 --> 02:07.233
Oh, well, Beckett got, uh,
baby showers in the break-up, so...

02:07.269 --> 02:10.803
That's funny, 'cause you...
Recently you just, uh,

02:10.839 --> 02:13.553
don't seem to be so tortured by all that.

02:14.775 --> 02:18.944
Oh, well, you know,
Beckett asked for some time,

02:18.980 --> 02:21.447
so I'm just giving it to her.

02:21.482 --> 02:22.781
- Every day.
- Well...

02:22.816 --> 02:24.149
- Sometimes twice.
- What?

02:24.185 --> 02:26.251
See, this is nice. Thank you so much.

02:26.950 --> 02:28.153
Yeah. No problem.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.554
Bye.

02:32.158 --> 02:33.257
- Morning.
- Hey.

02:33.293 --> 02:35.159
So, our Vic is a Russian national.

02:35.195 --> 02:37.628
Name of, uh... Grigory Mishkin.

02:37.663 --> 02:39.263
I spoke to the police commissioner.

02:39.299 --> 02:41.332
He's the son of a consulate officer,

02:41.368 --> 02:43.424
which means this might get political.

02:43.498 --> 02:44.553
Oh. Great.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.637
Lanie, so what do we got?

02:46.672 --> 02:47.837
Throat was slashed.

02:47.873 --> 02:51.274
Liver temp puts the time of
death between 2:00 and 4:00 A.M.

02:51.310 --> 02:52.842
Any idea what our victim was doing

02:52.878 --> 02:54.677
in an abandoned building
in the middle of the night?

02:54.713 --> 02:56.313
No. His pockets were turned out,

02:56.348 --> 02:58.748
but his wallet and
cellphone were found nearby.

02:58.783 --> 02:59.782
So the killer searched him,

02:59.818 --> 03:02.785
but there's no way to know
if anything was taken.

03:02.821 --> 03:04.502
Lanie, what do you make of these?

03:05.890 --> 03:07.490
Looks like ink that was transferred

03:07.525 --> 03:09.158
from whatever was in his shirt.

03:09.193 --> 03:12.361
See if the lab can
reconstruct the characters.

03:12.397 --> 03:14.130
He might have been killed
because of whatever was inside.

03:14.165 --> 03:15.664
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

03:15.699 --> 03:16.808
Howdy.

03:18.069 --> 03:19.335
"Howdy"?

03:20.804 --> 03:22.637
Yeah, um, "yo" is getting played out,

03:22.672 --> 03:23.804
so I thought I'd try something new.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.007
You might want to keep trying,
'cause "howdy" is just...

03:26.043 --> 03:27.395
Wrong.

03:28.045 --> 03:29.274
Well, I like it.

03:30.514 --> 03:31.679
Oh, by the way, there's a homeless guy

03:31.714 --> 03:32.947
that was camped out down the block.

03:32.982 --> 03:35.350
He heard a car roar to life,
burned rubber around 2:30 A.M.,

03:35.385 --> 03:36.951
so I'm pulling the street cam footage.

03:36.986 --> 03:39.719
All right, keep me posted. I'm gonna head
off to Russia and talk to the next of kin.

03:39.755 --> 03:40.720
- Russia?
- What?

03:40.756 --> 03:42.689
Uh, legally,

03:42.724 --> 03:45.392
a consulate is considered
foreign territory, so...

03:45.428 --> 03:46.326
Ah.

03:46.362 --> 03:48.595
All right, see you later.

03:51.867 --> 03:53.833
I'm Consul General Pavel Oborin.

03:53.869 --> 03:55.642
Captain Kate Beckett, NYPD.

03:55.811 --> 03:57.203
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Oborin.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.238
Yes, Captain.

03:58.344 --> 04:01.207
I will take you to Grigory's father,
Sergei.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.009
He hopes for a quick resolution
and to see justice served.

04:04.045 --> 04:05.911
As do we. Now, is it possible that

04:05.947 --> 04:09.415
Grigory's father's consulate
work put his son at risk?

04:09.451 --> 04:12.084
Oh, Mr. Mishkin writes economic
forecasts for commodities.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.152
It's hardly a thing worth killing for.

04:14.188 --> 04:15.653
And did you know Grigory?

04:15.689 --> 04:17.221
Oh, yes.

04:17.571 --> 04:19.524
I watched him grow up.

04:19.702 --> 04:22.327
You see, for us this is very personal.

04:22.362 --> 04:23.241
I understand.

04:23.304 --> 04:25.263
Then you will be amenable to my request

04:25.299 --> 04:27.232
to have a Russian
diplomatic security officer

04:27.267 --> 04:28.733
assigned to the case.

04:30.136 --> 04:32.369
Uh, Mr. Oborin, I appreciate the offer,

04:32.405 --> 04:34.405
but my detectives are the best in the city.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.872
Well, I do not doubt that.

04:35.908 --> 04:37.541
But still I must insist.

04:37.577 --> 04:42.079
A spirit of cooperation is
in everyone's best interest.

04:43.483 --> 04:45.316
_

04:45.954 --> 04:47.442
_

04:47.558 --> 04:50.453
Please,
can you tell me what happened with Grigory?

04:50.489 --> 04:53.223
Uh, we're not exactly sure just yet.

04:53.258 --> 04:56.192
Do you have any idea what he was
doing in an abandoned building?

04:56.228 --> 04:57.727
I wish I did.

04:57.762 --> 04:59.429
Grigory hasn't been himself

04:59.464 --> 05:02.232
since we lost his mother,
Anya, in a car accident.

05:02.267 --> 05:03.298
Uh-huh.

05:03.334 --> 05:05.467
The last month has been
a downward spiral of...

05:05.503 --> 05:06.968
of drinking, drugs.

05:07.004 --> 05:08.870
So he could have been
meeting with a dealer.

05:08.905 --> 05:10.472
I wouldn't know.

05:10.508 --> 05:13.208
But the new crowd he was
spending time with would.

05:13.244 --> 05:14.476
And what crowd is this?

05:14.512 --> 05:16.478
- Diplobrats.
- What...

05:16.514 --> 05:18.614
Spoiled children of foreign officers

05:18.649 --> 05:21.549
who flaunt the law with
diplomatic immunity.

05:21.584 --> 05:24.252
They do what they like,
and nobody can stop them.

05:24.287 --> 05:27.388
Grigory got lost in their world.

05:29.649 --> 05:32.293
Ryan: Meet the notorious
diplobrats of New York City.

05:32.328 --> 05:35.563
We arrest them,
but immunity means no prosecution.

05:35.598 --> 05:36.764
So it's like catch and release

05:36.799 --> 05:38.431
but without the cooler full of beer.

05:38.467 --> 05:39.732
Yeah,
I'm searching through all their files,

05:39.768 --> 05:41.234
see if there's a
connection back to our vic.

05:41.270 --> 05:42.469
But so far, nothing.

05:42.504 --> 05:44.404
Hey, did you hear the Russians
are sending one of their own

05:44.439 --> 05:45.772
- to ride along with us?
- Are you kidding me?

05:45.807 --> 05:46.873
Vasily Zhirov.

05:46.908 --> 05:49.643
He's part of the Russian
diplomatic security service.

05:49.678 --> 05:51.878
- "Red Heat" is coming here?
- Oh! Castle.

05:51.913 --> 05:52.812
Bearing gifts, I see.

05:52.847 --> 05:55.481
This is your starter kit for little Kevin.

05:55.516 --> 05:57.283
Except for the macallan
25 and the earplugs.

05:57.318 --> 05:58.350
Those are for you.

05:58.386 --> 05:59.351
You're a dear and thoughtful man.

05:59.387 --> 06:00.619
I know. So, a Russian?

06:00.655 --> 06:02.388
Yeah, Ivan Drago's in the house.

06:02.423 --> 06:05.023
I hear those guys are like automatons.
Strictly business.

06:05.059 --> 06:07.560
Well, if Boris is coming,
could Natasha be far behind?

06:07.595 --> 06:08.460
[Chuckles]

06:08.496 --> 06:09.328
[Russian accent] This could be trouble

06:09.363 --> 06:11.496
for the big moose and little squirrel.

06:11.531 --> 06:12.564
[Laughs] It's so...

06:12.599 --> 06:13.831
[normal voice] He's right behind me,
isn't he?

06:13.866 --> 06:14.666
Yeah.

06:18.238 --> 06:19.904
I know you.

06:19.939 --> 06:22.973
You're Richard Castle, no?

06:23.009 --> 06:24.542
Yes.

06:25.044 --> 06:26.477
Oh! Ooh!

06:26.513 --> 06:27.245
It's such an honor!

06:27.280 --> 06:29.513
The honor is mine, I assure you.

06:29.548 --> 06:30.514
Mwah! Mwah!

06:30.549 --> 06:31.748
Hey. Mwah.

06:31.783 --> 06:33.049
I love your books.

06:33.454 --> 06:37.554
Many a flight to Moscow,
I've been kept company by Derrick Storm.

06:38.557 --> 06:39.989
And Nikki Heat.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.825
Also known as Captain Beckett.

06:41.860 --> 06:45.482
It's also an honor to meet the muse,
the inspiration.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.631
Yeah, uh, welcome to the 12th, Mr. Zhirov.

06:48.666 --> 06:51.234
Such a famous crime-solving duo.

06:51.269 --> 06:53.869
It will be a privilege to watch you work.

06:53.905 --> 06:57.373
Uh, well, sadly,
we don't work together any longer.

06:59.416 --> 07:01.377
But it cannot be.

07:01.501 --> 07:05.914
Beckett without Castle is like,
uh, Boris without Natasha.

07:05.949 --> 07:08.216
It's like Starsky without the Hutch.

07:08.252 --> 07:09.384
It's just Hutch.

07:09.420 --> 07:10.385
Not "the Hutch."

07:10.835 --> 07:12.521
You said "the Hutch."

07:12.556 --> 07:13.655
[Cellphone chimes]

07:13.690 --> 07:16.058
Uh, street cams weren't
able to get our getaway car,

07:16.093 --> 07:18.360
but shotspotter was tripped
by the engine noise.

07:18.395 --> 07:19.893
What is, uh, spot shotter?

07:19.929 --> 07:20.994
Castle: Shotspotter.

07:21.030 --> 07:23.431
Audio surveillance system
designed to detect gunshots.

07:23.466 --> 07:26.367
And noises over 120 decibels
can also activate the system,

07:26.402 --> 07:27.501
so we got a recording.

07:27.537 --> 07:29.570
[ <i>Engine revs</i> ]

07:29.605 --> 07:31.939
[ <i>Tires screech</i> ]

07:31.974 --> 07:32.973
You know what? I'll just have to get,

07:33.008 --> 07:35.209
uh, experts to tell me what
kind of make and model.

07:35.244 --> 07:37.277
No need. That is a Lamborghini Huracán.

07:37.312 --> 07:38.344
Yeah, the v-10s are notorious

07:38.380 --> 07:41.678
for crackling and popping
like a breakfast cereal.

07:42.451 --> 07:44.451
- Jurgen Kass.
- Hmm?

07:44.486 --> 07:47.287
The son of the Finnish ambassador

07:47.322 --> 07:49.289
has that very same car.

07:49.324 --> 07:52.858
He also has a history of
drug and assault charges,

07:52.894 --> 07:55.094
though, of course,
all of those charges were dropped

07:55.129 --> 07:56.595
due to his diplomatic immunity.

07:56.630 --> 07:58.530
Well, murder doesn't get a pass,
so pick him up.

07:59.733 --> 08:02.134
Mr. Castle,
you already have broken open the case.

08:02.169 --> 08:04.069
Yeah.
You know, I'd be glad to stick around...

08:04.105 --> 08:07.372
But I actually have some
business to attend to, so...

08:07.408 --> 08:09.274
Oh. [Laughing]

08:09.310 --> 08:11.409
There we go.

08:11.444 --> 08:12.876
[Chuckles]

08:14.481 --> 08:15.613
I should go.

08:15.648 --> 08:16.747
So...

08:16.782 --> 08:18.048
Oh. Yes.

08:26.493 --> 08:28.458
- What's up, five-oh?
- Ah, Jurgen.

08:28.494 --> 08:30.460
I don't think you understand
the trouble you're in.

08:30.496 --> 08:32.462
Oh, please. I ain't in trouble.

08:32.498 --> 08:33.895
I <i> am</i> trouble.

08:33.932 --> 08:35.565
Oh, yeah. You're a regular scarface.

08:35.601 --> 08:37.234
Sit down. Now.

08:37.269 --> 08:38.174
[Scoffs]

08:38.227 --> 08:39.336
You think you scare me, five-oh?

08:39.371 --> 08:40.236
Please.

08:40.272 --> 08:42.405
I could put my little man on this table,

08:42.441 --> 08:44.673
and there's not one thing you could do.

08:44.708 --> 08:46.175
If I see your little man,

08:46.210 --> 08:47.774
we're gonna have a little problem.

08:48.646 --> 08:50.812
- This guy.
- Sit down.

08:51.479 --> 08:53.875
You are worried I'm here
to make troubles for you.

08:54.023 --> 08:55.684
No. No, of course not.

08:55.719 --> 08:56.952
Captain,

08:56.987 --> 09:00.156
do you really want to start
off this friendship with a lie?

09:00.191 --> 09:01.623
Okay, fine.

09:01.658 --> 09:04.098
The truth... A young man was murdered,

09:04.171 --> 09:06.261
and I don't want politics to get in the way

09:06.296 --> 09:07.962
of catching the bastard who did it.

09:07.997 --> 09:09.340
I admire your passion.

09:09.393 --> 09:10.698
Very Russian.

09:10.733 --> 09:13.434
Rest assured,
I do not wish to interfere in your case.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.337
I'm as far from the political
animal as one can get.

09:16.373 --> 09:19.873
Frankly, I am excited to learn
from Katherine the great.

09:19.908 --> 09:22.176
May I share a secret?

09:22.211 --> 09:23.544
Uh, yes.

09:23.579 --> 09:25.131
I've never been to New York.

09:25.184 --> 09:27.681
And I was hoping there
will be some downtime

09:27.716 --> 09:29.015
for me to see the sights.

09:29.051 --> 09:30.116
Uh, yes. Of course.

09:30.152 --> 09:33.853
In fact, I can bring you in
for the important moments.

09:33.889 --> 09:36.171
And otherwise,
the city is yours to explore.

09:37.225 --> 09:38.357
[Clears throat]

09:38.393 --> 09:40.493
Ryan: You went for a little
ride in the warehouse district.

09:40.528 --> 09:42.395
We know you were at that
abandoned building last night.

09:42.430 --> 09:44.730
You met Grigory there to sell him drugs.

09:44.765 --> 09:47.200
And then when he stiffed you,
you killed him.

09:47.235 --> 09:49.093
[Sighs] All right.

09:49.167 --> 09:50.570
I confess.

09:50.605 --> 09:52.704
I confess that, uh,

09:52.739 --> 09:54.839
I am rich, bitches.

09:54.874 --> 09:56.007
[Chuckles]

09:56.042 --> 09:57.975
[Sighs]

09:58.011 --> 09:59.010
Say "cheese."

09:59.045 --> 10:00.579
The hell's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

10:00.614 --> 10:04.249
You're the prime suspect
in a murder investigation.

10:04.284 --> 10:07.419
You know I have diplomatic immunity.

10:07.454 --> 10:10.254
To charge me, your state department

10:10.289 --> 10:14.057
has to ask my government's permission,
which they have not.

10:14.093 --> 10:17.828
But, um, this has been awesome.

10:17.863 --> 10:19.463
Peace out.

10:23.969 --> 10:25.402
The suspect is leaving.

10:25.438 --> 10:27.237
Yeah, cases don't always get solved

10:27.272 --> 10:29.405
as quickly as they do in Castle's books.

10:29.441 --> 10:30.431
What will you do next?

10:30.509 --> 10:32.509
Just keep digging till we find
some hard evidence on Jurgen.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.210
Means that now might be a good time

10:34.246 --> 10:37.213
to go do that thing that we talked about.

10:37.249 --> 10:39.149
Spasibo.

10:39.184 --> 10:40.816
- Where's he going?
- Sightseeing.

10:40.852 --> 10:43.385
Looks like he won't be a problem after all.

10:43.421 --> 10:45.054
[Telephone rings]

10:45.089 --> 10:46.821
Richard Castle Investigations.

10:46.857 --> 10:48.190
This is Vasily.

10:48.225 --> 10:49.724
I have most important news to discuss.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.826
Uh, listen, if it's about the case...

10:51.862 --> 10:54.696
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You see, I'm a writer, too.

10:54.731 --> 10:55.931
Of course you are.

10:55.966 --> 10:57.599
I have an idea for a Nikki Heat novel.

10:57.634 --> 10:59.701
- Of course you do.
- Let's meet for coffee.

10:59.736 --> 11:01.335
Let me... let me...
I'm gonna check my schedule.

11:01.371 --> 11:02.537
[Clears throat]

11:04.374 --> 11:05.839
[Cellphone rings] Hey.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.942
Vasily Zhirov wants me
to meet him for coffee.

11:07.977 --> 11:09.243
- What should I do?
- Keep him happy.

11:09.279 --> 11:10.278
The more time he spends with you,

11:10.313 --> 11:12.346
the less he's gonna be
hanging over my shoulder.

11:12.382 --> 11:13.847
And if I keep him happy?

11:13.883 --> 11:16.584
Then I will keep you happy.

11:16.619 --> 11:17.350
Done.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.718
Vasily!

11:18.753 --> 11:21.388
The title of the book will be
"Heat and Ice."

11:21.423 --> 11:23.790
Ice is the code name for
the new Russian super spy

11:23.825 --> 11:26.859
who is Nikki Heat's new Nemesis.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.895
Enemy from the east. A new cold war.

11:28.930 --> 11:29.729
Cold war! Yes!

11:29.764 --> 11:32.566
But though Heat and Ice are rivals,

11:32.601 --> 11:37.403
their sexual attraction
is like nuclear fire!

11:37.438 --> 11:38.537
Vasily.
[Laughs]

11:38.573 --> 11:41.974
I, uh, have to admit you are
not at all what I expected.

11:42.009 --> 11:45.377
You thought I'd be like... "Red Heat."

11:45.413 --> 11:46.445
Yeah.

11:46.481 --> 11:47.413
That is old Russia.

11:47.448 --> 11:48.581
I am new Russia.

11:48.616 --> 11:49.848
[Both laugh]

11:52.260 --> 11:54.352
Isn't that our suspect?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.389
What a coincidence.

11:58.425 --> 12:01.426
Your detective friends didn't
have much luck questioning him.

12:01.461 --> 12:03.461
I wonder if we can do better.

12:03.497 --> 12:06.231
Oh, maybe we should leave it alone.

12:06.266 --> 12:08.332
Maybe we shouldn't interfere, uh...

12:08.367 --> 12:09.500
Hello.

12:10.352 --> 12:11.168
Who are you?

12:11.203 --> 12:13.337
Hey, pick up book, young man.

12:13.372 --> 12:14.304
This here is Richard Castle,

12:14.340 --> 12:16.640
one of the great mystery
writers of our time.

12:16.675 --> 12:18.675
And he has a few questions for you

12:18.710 --> 12:21.478
about the murder of Grigory Mishkin.

12:21.514 --> 12:23.413
Oh, get lost, Ivan.

12:23.449 --> 12:26.782
If the cops can't touch me,
what are you guys going to do?

12:26.817 --> 12:29.285
Ah. Diplomatic immunity.

12:29.320 --> 12:33.356
It is like a soft fur coat
that keeps you warm and cozy.

12:33.391 --> 12:34.557
In America.

12:34.592 --> 12:39.195
But, my friend,
Russian justice plays by different rules.

12:39.230 --> 12:41.364
What is Russian justice?

12:41.399 --> 12:43.532
Oh, how should I describe this?

12:43.567 --> 12:44.266
Oh! Yes.

12:44.301 --> 12:46.535
When you're in Ibiza next month,

12:46.570 --> 12:48.870
you might wake up on the beach...

12:48.905 --> 12:50.905
Without your feet.

12:54.378 --> 12:55.777
Okay.

12:55.812 --> 12:58.071
I didn't tell this to the cops because...

12:59.172 --> 13:02.049
my father gets furious
when I hang with Russians.

13:02.084 --> 13:04.218
Our countries have bad history, you know.

13:04.253 --> 13:08.037
Look,
I dropped Grigory off at that building

13:08.177 --> 13:09.856
after we took care of a little business,

13:09.892 --> 13:11.458
but I never went in.

13:11.494 --> 13:12.493
What kind of business? Drugs?

13:12.528 --> 13:13.360
No. He owed me a ticket

13:13.396 --> 13:15.762
to a reception at the Russian consulate.

13:17.499 --> 13:19.666
It will be wall-to-wall Russian models.

13:19.701 --> 13:22.100
Yes. Russian women are
devastatingly beautiful.

13:22.164 --> 13:24.804
Tell me... What did you give Grigory

13:24.839 --> 13:26.138
in the return for the ticket?

13:26.174 --> 13:27.240
A manual

13:27.275 --> 13:30.410
on how to hack the computer
of a Cherokee automobile.

13:30.445 --> 13:31.511
This is a strange request.

13:31.546 --> 13:32.712
What did he want with that?

13:32.747 --> 13:33.910
He didn't say.

13:33.981 --> 13:34.746
I swear.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.315
Who was he meeting in this building?

13:36.350 --> 13:37.682
I have no idea.

13:37.718 --> 13:39.684
Very well.

13:40.687 --> 13:41.653
Have a nice day.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.453
So, uh...

13:43.991 --> 13:45.690
We're cool, right?

13:50.897 --> 13:52.230
Esposito:
How the hell did you get Jurgen to talk?

13:52.265 --> 13:54.832
Vasily helped him see the value of honesty.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.501
What can I say? I'm a people's person.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.237
Why would Grigory want to hack a Cherokee?

13:59.272 --> 14:00.638
Well, this might explain that.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.206
The lab deciphered those characters

14:02.242 --> 14:04.675
from the ink stain they
found on Grigory's shirt.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.644
It is a case number from a
state trooper incident report

14:07.679 --> 14:10.253
for the car accident that
killed Grigory's mother.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.549
Let me guess. She was driving a Cherokee.

14:12.584 --> 14:13.583
Correct.

14:13.618 --> 14:16.353
So Grigory doesn't think
her death was an accident.

14:17.622 --> 14:19.322
That might be what got him killed.

According to the state trooper's report,
Anya Mishkin,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.525
our victim's mother,
died in a single-vehicle crash

14:31.546 --> 14:33.763
on highway 9 upstate near cold Springs.

14:33.836 --> 14:35.836
Her car hit a tree and burned
sometime after 1:00 A.M.

14:35.871 --> 14:37.551
Castle: You know, a fire would cover up

14:37.646 --> 14:39.372
any evidence of a software
hack causing that crash.

14:39.408 --> 14:42.009
Yeah, but, Castle,
there's no indication in these files

14:42.044 --> 14:44.344
- that it was murder.
- But clearly Grigory thought

14:44.379 --> 14:46.479
someone sabotaged his mother's
car in order to kill her.

14:46.515 --> 14:47.715
And investigating that theory

14:47.750 --> 14:49.616
got Grigory killed by the saboteur.

14:49.651 --> 14:51.766
I couldn't have said it better myself.

14:51.861 --> 14:53.552
According to the financial records,
four days ago,

14:53.588 --> 14:55.688
Grigory stayed in a bed and
breakfast near the crash site,

14:55.724 --> 14:57.489
the same one that his mom
was staying in when she died.

14:57.525 --> 14:58.891
Reach out to that bed and breakfast,

14:58.927 --> 15:01.794
see if they know what Grigory was up to.

15:01.830 --> 15:04.396
So, it's left to us to
talk to Grigory's father,

15:04.432 --> 15:06.165
see if he harbors similar suspicions.

15:06.201 --> 15:10.493
Vasily, uh, Castle and I don't
work together any longer.

15:10.578 --> 15:12.871
Yes, news of which is more than I can bear.

15:12.906 --> 15:15.707

I need you to work with Castle.

15:25.584 --> 15:26.617
Oh, uh, commissioner, no,

15:26.652 --> 15:29.353
we are doing everything we
can to assist Mr. Zhirov.

15:29.388 --> 15:31.088
Yeah, I've met him. He's, uh, a character.

15:31.124 --> 15:32.422
I would love to work with them.

15:32.458 --> 15:34.391
I would love to have Castle work with us.

15:34.426 --> 15:36.560
- All right. Bye.

- Yeah.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.968
Yeah,

15:45.003 --> 15:46.535
Poor guy was asking about his mom.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.737
She loved staying here
at my bed and breakfast.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.539
What a shame about the accident.

15:50.575 --> 15:51.674
What do you remember about her?

15:51.709 --> 15:55.411
Nice lady.
Stayed here a few nights with a boyfriend.

15:55.447 --> 15:56.545
Did you get his name?

15:56.581 --> 15:57.713
No. Sorry.

15:57.748 --> 15:58.948
Can you describe him?

15:58.983 --> 16:00.148
I can do you one better.

16:00.184 --> 16:02.750
The kid was asking the same question,

16:02.786 --> 16:05.905
so I pulled security video and got...

16:07.340 --> 16:08.390
This.

16:14.498 --> 16:16.397
Beckett: Mr. Mishkin,
was there anything in your son

16:16.432 --> 16:19.233
or late wife's behavior
that would merit suspicion?

16:19.268 --> 16:22.269
If there was,
I would have told our security agents.

16:22.305 --> 16:23.932
What was your wife doing upstate?

16:24.206 --> 16:25.806
Um...

16:25.841 --> 16:28.376
I believe she was having an affair.

16:29.278 --> 16:31.112
- Uh, with whom?
- I don't know.

16:31.147 --> 16:32.746
We have grown apart,

16:32.781 --> 16:35.781
but we both wanted to serve at this post,

16:35.817 --> 16:37.736
so we led separate lives.

16:38.186 --> 16:39.285
We have to go someplace.

16:39.321 --> 16:41.454
Excuse us, please.

16:46.802 --> 16:48.328
I'll need her contact list,

16:48.363 --> 16:50.195
along with anything else that could help us

16:50.231 --> 16:52.131
identify who she might have been seeing.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.966
Yes, of... of course.

It's no joke. We must hurry.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.854
- Okay.
- It is possible that Grigory,

17:16.888 --> 17:18.955
even though he did not work here,

17:18.991 --> 17:22.393
kept a dedicated e-mail
account on our private server.

17:22.429 --> 17:23.394
This will tell us a little bit more

17:23.430 --> 17:25.564
about his investigation
into his mother's death.

17:26.665 --> 17:28.998
Yes. And there it is.

17:29.034 --> 17:33.303
I see urgent e-mails from emily2929,

17:33.338 --> 17:36.239
pleading for him to call her.

17:36.275 --> 17:40.009
She's scared,
states that they're both in trouble.

17:40.045 --> 17:41.743
And the last one was sent the day he died.

17:41.779 --> 17:43.679
But who's emily2929?

17:43.714 --> 17:46.082
Beckett: Emily Hopper,
do you know why you're here?

17:46.117 --> 17:47.583
This is about Grigory Mishkin?

17:47.618 --> 17:50.186
Yeah, what was your relationship with him?

17:50.221 --> 17:51.420
Vasily: Ah.

17:51.456 --> 17:53.389
You're about to lie.

17:53.424 --> 17:55.357
Don't do it.

17:55.393 --> 17:57.756
It will not be good for you.

17:59.170 --> 18:01.729
I saw him a couple of days ago.

18:01.764 --> 18:04.332
I'd always had a thing for him,
so we hooked up.

18:04.367 --> 18:06.033
But that's it. Whatever this is about,

18:06.069 --> 18:08.097
whatever he did,
I-I had nothing to do with it.

18:08.150 --> 18:10.771
And what do you think this is about,
exactly?

18:10.807 --> 18:12.340
I don't know.

18:12.375 --> 18:13.341
Nothing.

18:13.376 --> 18:14.976
Emily, Grigory is dead.

18:16.479 --> 18:17.311
Oh, God.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.113
What happened the last time you saw him?

18:19.148 --> 18:22.249
Why did you send him e-mails
demanding he call you?

18:22.284 --> 18:26.086
I fell asleep after we...

18:26.122 --> 18:28.682
When I woke up,
I-I thought I saw him on my laptop.

18:28.735 --> 18:30.793
He denied it, but after he left,

18:30.859 --> 18:33.159
I realized that he'd used my work login

18:33.194 --> 18:34.494
to access a client's data.

18:34.529 --> 18:35.928
And what kind of work do you do?

18:35.963 --> 18:38.264
I work with a data storage company.

18:38.299 --> 18:43.091
We archive files for businesses
and some government agencies.

18:43.505 --> 18:46.639
Okay, you need to tell me what
files Grigory was looking at.

18:46.674 --> 18:48.508
Whatever he saw might
have gotten him killed.

18:56.601 --> 18:58.483
Espo.

18:58.519 --> 18:59.936
Come here.

19:01.088 --> 19:02.279
Close the door.

19:03.915 --> 19:07.158
Emily Hopper's cloud storage
company archives old FBI files.

19:07.193 --> 19:08.476
That's what Grigory was after.

19:08.527 --> 19:09.827
What kind of FBI files?

19:09.863 --> 19:12.096
A 1980s cold war operation

19:12.131 --> 19:15.933
to identify and flip Soviet
sleeper agents in the U.S.

19:15.969 --> 19:17.201
Sleepers?

19:17.237 --> 19:20.283
- I thought directorate s was a myth.
- No, it was very real.

19:20.378 --> 19:24.272
And the FBI's biggest catch
was KGB Agent Anatoly Arkady.

19:24.621 --> 19:25.775
In '87, he defected

19:25.810 --> 19:28.970
and went into Witness
Protection as Frank Thomas.

19:29.128 --> 19:31.948
And that's Frank present day,
still living in the U.S.

19:31.984 --> 19:34.017
This is our guy from the bed and breakfast.

19:34.052 --> 19:38.154
And the woman in here is Grigory's mother,
Anya Mishkin,

19:38.751 --> 19:41.123
also a Soviet agent.

19:42.550 --> 19:43.292
She's a spy.

19:43.327 --> 19:45.627
This is bigger than an
illicit affair gone wrong.

19:46.392 --> 19:48.530
And I'm beginning to think
that our friendly Russian

19:48.565 --> 19:50.620
knows more than he's telling.

19:57.787 --> 19:59.792
- [Speaks Russian] Vasily.
- [Speaks Russian]

19:59.855 --> 20:02.457
Hey, can I borrow Castle and
Ryan for a couple minutes?

20:02.629 --> 20:04.660
It's about Ryan's baby shower.

20:05.201 --> 20:10.030
How many American men does it
take to plan a baby shower?

20:10.065 --> 20:11.230
Um, three.

20:11.266 --> 20:13.398
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Shall we?

20:13.434 --> 20:14.567
Ryan: Hey, Javi, what's going on?

20:14.602 --> 20:16.501
You know if Vasily recognized this guy?

20:16.537 --> 20:18.370
- I don't think so.
- Why do you ask?

20:18.405 --> 20:21.039
Because Frank's real
name is Anatoly Arkady.

20:21.075 --> 20:23.108
He's a defector from Russia
from back in the cold war.

20:23.144 --> 20:24.277
And...

20:24.312 --> 20:26.245
Grigory's mom, Anya, is a spy.

20:26.281 --> 20:27.280
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:27.315 --> 20:29.887
Wow. That is so cool...

20:29.926 --> 20:31.283
Bad. It's obviously bad.

20:31.318 --> 20:32.984
Their relationship wasn't romantic?

20:33.019 --> 20:34.486
Beckett:
We're not sure what their relationship was.

20:34.521 --> 20:35.887
Either way, we now know

20:35.922 --> 20:38.156
that Vasily's motives cannot be trusted.

20:38.191 --> 20:41.159
[Sighs] A defector resurfaces, a spy dies,

20:41.194 --> 20:44.061
and her son is killed in
the middle of the night.

20:44.097 --> 20:45.597
This novel writes itself.

20:45.632 --> 20:46.597
Tell us what happens next.

20:46.632 --> 20:48.565
I have no idea.
That's what makes it so good.

20:48.601 --> 20:50.267
Frank, a.k.a. Anatoly,

20:50.303 --> 20:52.336
is the key to figuring out
what's behind these murders,

20:52.371 --> 20:54.338
so you guys dig into his life
and see what you can find.

20:54.373 --> 20:55.572
What do you want us to do about Vasily?

20:55.608 --> 20:58.175
We got to keep him as far away
from this case as possible,

20:58.210 --> 21:01.144
which means we need to
launch operation nickel tour.

21:01.180 --> 21:02.946
Right.

21:02.981 --> 21:03.780
What's that?

21:03.815 --> 21:05.748
You're gonna take him sightseeing.

21:05.784 --> 21:06.683
See what he knows.

21:06.718 --> 21:08.351
In the meantime, I'm gonna talk to the feds

21:08.386 --> 21:10.085
and see if they have any intel

21:10.121 --> 21:12.188
on Anatoly returning to active status.

21:12.223 --> 21:14.089
[Cellphone clicks, beeps]

21:14.125 --> 21:16.025
[Ringing]

21:16.060 --> 21:17.327
Hello.

21:17.362 --> 21:18.795
I need my curtains cleaned.

21:18.830 --> 21:20.095
Castle: Vasily.

21:20.131 --> 21:22.597
Is the baby party emergency resolved?

21:22.633 --> 21:24.366
Oh, yeah, yeah. And, uh, good news.

21:24.401 --> 21:27.202
The boys have hours and
hours of research to do,

21:27.237 --> 21:28.937
phone calls for the case.

21:28.972 --> 21:30.639
So I thought why not take this chance

21:30.674 --> 21:32.708
to show you around this
little island we call home.

21:32.743 --> 21:34.443
Is this not a critical juncture?

21:34.478 --> 21:35.844
I don't want to be a shirker.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.045
Oh, come on.
A little shirking never hurt anyone.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.714
We'll have a late lunch
at tavern on the green,

21:39.749 --> 21:42.149
and, uh, a carriage ride around the park.

21:42.184 --> 21:43.484
[Stifled chuckle]

21:43.519 --> 21:44.952
It's a tradition.

21:44.987 --> 21:47.154
Oh. This is why we have cellphones, huh?

21:47.189 --> 21:48.656
Exactly! Let's go.

21:49.325 --> 21:51.492
So, I want to hear more about you.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.494
Diplomatic security sounds fascinating.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.161
Ah. It's like theater.

21:55.196 --> 21:56.696
Everyone pretends to be one thing

21:56.732 --> 21:58.164
when, really, they're another.

21:58.199 --> 22:01.167
And nobody cares about
anything but the results.

22:01.202 --> 22:03.069
[Cellphone vibrates] Ah. Bosses, right?

22:03.104 --> 22:05.204
What do they know? Who do you report to?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.540
Sorry, my <i> mamotchka</i> needs attention,

22:07.576 --> 22:08.708
- if it's okay?
- Oh, listen,

22:08.744 --> 22:11.177
I know a thing or two about
having a needy <i> mamotchka.</i>

22:11.212 --> 22:12.611
[Speaks Russian]

22:12.646 --> 22:14.279
Oh.

22:14.314 --> 22:16.948
It's the Richard Castle.

22:16.984 --> 22:18.658
[Speaks Russian]

22:23.223 --> 22:25.290
<i>Do svidaniya.</i>

22:25.325 --> 22:27.125
She is most excited that I met you.

22:27.160 --> 22:28.526
Oh, well, I'm sure an autographed copy

22:28.561 --> 22:29.894
of my latest book could be arranged.

22:29.929 --> 22:31.195
Amazing.

22:31.230 --> 22:33.097
She also requested a few souvenirs.

22:33.132 --> 22:35.433
- We can go?
- Anywhere you like.

22:35.468 --> 22:39.270
Rita,
thank you for meeting with me so quickly.

22:39.305 --> 22:42.106
I like it.
Although when I ran ops in strip clubs,

22:42.141 --> 22:43.559
we were open for business.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.475
Okay, so I've got two murders,

22:45.511 --> 22:47.277
and all roads lead towards

22:47.312 --> 22:49.879
a Russian defector from the '80s,
Anatoly Arkady.

22:49.971 --> 22:51.114
Doesn't ring a bell.

22:51.149 --> 22:52.616
Okay, well, the FBI put him in wit-pro

22:52.651 --> 22:53.717
under the name Frank Thomas,

22:53.752 --> 22:56.486
and I was hoping you could
put out a few quiet feelers,

22:56.522 --> 22:58.595
see if he's working a new operation.

22:58.648 --> 22:59.989
I'll take care of it.

23:00.025 --> 23:01.445
Okay.

23:01.656 --> 23:03.258
You really did it.

23:03.767 --> 23:05.127
You blew up your marriage

23:05.162 --> 23:07.262
and went down the loksat rabbit hole.

23:07.661 --> 23:09.665
Uh...

23:10.260 --> 23:11.448
What?

23:11.725 --> 23:13.302
[Stammers] No... nothing.

23:13.337 --> 23:15.838
It's just that, um, well,
you've been watching us,

23:15.873 --> 23:17.973
and you think that we're broken up.

23:18.008 --> 23:19.941
But you're not.

23:19.976 --> 23:23.169
Oh, I love a little sexual subterfuge.

23:23.262 --> 23:25.179
Oh, it makes things so much hotter.

23:25.215 --> 23:27.716
So, Castle is playing tour guide

23:27.751 --> 23:30.318
to a Russian diplomatic security officer.

23:30.354 --> 23:31.686
His name's Vasily...

23:31.722 --> 23:33.187
Vasily Zhirov?

23:33.223 --> 23:34.255
Yeah. Do you know him?

23:34.290 --> 23:36.590
He's a cleaner with Russian
foreign intelligence.

23:36.625 --> 23:39.226
So diplomatic security's just a cover?

23:39.261 --> 23:41.228
- Yeah.
- Then what's his real mission?

23:41.263 --> 23:42.162
Who knows?

23:42.197 --> 23:44.097
But if your husband gets in Vasily's way,

23:44.132 --> 23:46.133
he's gonna be collateral damage.

23:50.406 --> 23:52.439
Um, unless your <i> mamotchka</i>

23:52.475 --> 23:54.540
is a fan of rat droppings
and dirty needles,

23:54.576 --> 23:57.042
there's really not much around
here by the way of souvenirs.

23:57.078 --> 23:59.178
[Chuckles] Her tastes can be unusual.

23:59.213 --> 24:00.847
[Both laugh]

24:00.882 --> 24:03.148
Actually, I lied about earlier.

24:04.085 --> 24:05.217
Ah... ow.

24:05.253 --> 24:08.554
[Stammering]

24:08.590 --> 24:10.222
Why... Why did you do that?

24:10.258 --> 24:11.222
Don't worry.

24:11.258 --> 24:13.558
You'll soon find out.

24:13.594 --> 24:14.893
Vasily.

24:17.330 --> 24:19.197
Hey, hey, hey...

24:19.232 --> 24:20.399
What are you doing?

24:20.434 --> 24:22.401
Vasily, get off me.

24:22.436 --> 24:25.470
[Thumping]

24:25.506 --> 24:27.071
[Indistinct shouting]

24:27.107 --> 24:28.506
[Trunk slams]

24:30.175 --> 24:31.275
I'm sorry.

24:31.310 --> 24:33.811
Our carriage ride around
the park will have to wait.

24:52.209 --> 24:52.908
Who are you?

24:52.974 --> 24:54.953
Obviously you're not some

24:55.005 --> 24:57.614
happy-go-lucky diplomatic security agent.

24:57.649 --> 24:59.349
You remember Arnold Schwarzenegger

24:59.384 --> 25:01.641
in the movie "Red Heat," yes?

25:01.721 --> 25:06.421
Compared to me, his character is like weak,
non-violent child.

25:11.161 --> 25:12.527
Hello, sunshine.

25:12.563 --> 25:14.563
Come on. Come on.

25:15.481 --> 25:18.066
Russian intelligence picked
up chatter about an attack

25:18.101 --> 25:20.268
on Russian citizens in the United States.

25:20.303 --> 25:24.104
If that happens,
dead Russians on American soil,

25:24.140 --> 25:26.741
it will be very bad for both our countries.

25:26.776 --> 25:28.376
So we take that to Homeland Security.

25:28.411 --> 25:29.910
I cannot.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.945
It is believed the attackers are Russian.

25:31.981 --> 25:33.447
Do you understand now?

25:33.483 --> 25:35.783
I believe Anya Mishkin and this traitor

25:35.818 --> 25:37.317
are part of the conspiracy.

25:37.352 --> 25:39.051
[Sighs] Poor Grigory got murdered

25:39.087 --> 25:41.395
because he stumbled into it.

25:43.128 --> 25:44.539
I must break him.

25:44.698 --> 25:47.427
I'm not telling you squat, comrade.

25:47.463 --> 25:48.861
Do you hear that, Rick?

25:48.897 --> 25:50.564
You couldn't get me to talk...

25:50.599 --> 25:52.932
[muffled talking]

25:53.431 --> 25:55.734
Even though he lived as an
American all these decades,

25:55.769 --> 25:58.904
still he's Russian in his heart.

25:59.306 --> 26:01.607
But I will soften him up.

26:01.642 --> 26:03.309
[Sighs]

26:03.344 --> 26:05.244
Like ice cream on a hot summer day.

26:05.279 --> 26:07.246
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I can't let you do that.

26:07.281 --> 26:10.249
Rick, you're a nice guy.

26:10.284 --> 26:11.716
I like you.

26:11.751 --> 26:12.783
So, please...

26:12.819 --> 26:15.386
Don't make me hurt you, too.

26:15.422 --> 26:17.263
Please.

26:18.186 --> 26:20.625
Please tell me you have a
line on Vasily and Castle.

26:20.660 --> 26:22.227
- Nothing yet.
- Did you ping Castle's phone?

26:22.262 --> 26:23.728
It's been deactivated.

26:24.774 --> 26:27.599
Pain is the only way we get through.

26:27.634 --> 26:29.133
- There's another way.
- No, there is not!

26:29.168 --> 26:30.601
There is always another way.

26:30.636 --> 26:32.336
Look,
I wish I had more time to humor you...

26:32.371 --> 26:34.904
60 seconds. Just give me 60 seconds.

26:34.940 --> 26:36.240
Please.

26:36.275 --> 26:37.780
60 seconds?

26:40.679 --> 26:42.556
Fine. Show me what you got.

26:45.696 --> 26:46.915
Uh, go.

26:46.951 --> 26:49.418
All right,
obviously this would go a lot easier

26:49.454 --> 26:51.487
if you would just tell
him what he needs to know.

26:51.523 --> 26:53.856
Okay. What he needs to know is

26:53.891 --> 26:56.192
- that you can both go screw yourselves!
- Really?!

26:56.227 --> 26:59.295
Rick, I hate to be rude,
but so far I'm not impressed.

26:59.330 --> 27:01.631
- 55 seconds!
- Okay, okay, okay.

27:01.666 --> 27:03.698
If... if Frank is at the
center of this conspiracy,

27:03.733 --> 27:05.700
then he may have some clues on him

27:05.735 --> 27:08.670
as to where the attack
is going to take place.

27:08.705 --> 27:09.671
- 42 seconds.
- Receipt.

27:09.706 --> 27:12.006
There's a receipt for a...

27:12.042 --> 27:13.275
Lamination kit.

27:13.310 --> 27:15.310
Which means what, exactly?

27:15.345 --> 27:16.711
I have no idea.

27:16.746 --> 27:18.280
Very good. 42 seconds.

27:18.315 --> 27:19.547
41.

27:19.582 --> 27:20.747
Okay, okay.

27:20.783 --> 27:25.052
All right, his map history has
a search for uniform stores.

27:25.087 --> 27:26.787
Okay. Call history.

27:26.822 --> 27:28.689
Called the same number
three times the last week.

27:28.724 --> 27:30.123
- 29 seconds.
- Thank you.

27:30.159 --> 27:31.792
This is fun, no?

27:31.827 --> 27:33.561
It's a caterer.

27:33.596 --> 27:35.629
Why a catering company? What am I missing?

27:35.665 --> 27:37.330
More time. Only 24 seconds left.

27:37.365 --> 27:38.631
Come on. Seriously?

27:38.667 --> 27:39.799
All right, okay.

27:39.834 --> 27:41.467
Lamination kit is...

27:41.503 --> 27:43.836
It's, uh, you're making fake I.D.s.

27:43.871 --> 27:46.906
Making fake I.D.S to get
someone into a catering company.

27:46.941 --> 27:48.708
Why?

27:48.743 --> 27:50.743
To slip into an event.

27:50.778 --> 27:51.711
But what event?

27:51.746 --> 27:53.845
You're...

27:53.880 --> 27:55.980
The party at the Russian consulate.

27:56.016 --> 27:58.083
You're making a fake I.D. to
sneak someone into a party

27:58.118 --> 28:00.586
at the Russian consulate
dressed as catering staff.

28:00.621 --> 28:02.020
Right?!
[Laughs]

28:02.055 --> 28:03.855
Brilliant!

28:03.890 --> 28:04.789
And with time to spare!

28:04.825 --> 28:06.891
Actually, no. The party's about to begin.

28:06.927 --> 28:07.959
- Okay.
- [Claps hands] We must hurry.

28:07.994 --> 28:10.328
I'm gonna call Beckett,
have unis pick Frank up.

28:10.363 --> 28:11.495
Have them meet us at the consulate.

28:11.531 --> 28:12.763
[Muffled yelling]
Bye, Frank.

28:15.603 --> 28:16.934
Guys.

28:16.969 --> 28:17.835
They're denying us entry.

28:17.870 --> 28:19.437
Because this is considered Russian soil,

28:19.472 --> 28:20.538
we can't force our way in.

28:20.573 --> 28:22.906
Why hasn't the consul general
canceled the party yet?

28:22.942 --> 28:25.276
How do you say?
This is not good for business.

28:25.311 --> 28:26.875
If Oborin cancels without credible proof,

28:27.013 --> 28:28.978
he looks weak in the
eyes of his adversaries.

28:29.014 --> 28:30.447
Politics wins over death threats?

28:30.482 --> 28:32.516
In Russia,
it's better to be killed than lose face.

28:32.551 --> 28:33.916
You need to get us in. Now.

28:33.952 --> 28:35.619
- It's invite only.
- So invite us.

28:35.654 --> 28:37.488
We'll be your plus four.

28:39.791 --> 28:41.842
[Laughter]

28:42.224 --> 28:44.660
So what's the plan?
We don't even know who the target is.

28:44.695 --> 28:46.962
Look for anyone out of
place or acting unusual.

28:46.997 --> 28:48.197
Well, we know their attacker is dressed

28:48.232 --> 28:49.598
as one of the catering staff, right?

28:49.634 --> 28:50.732
Well, not necessarily.

28:50.768 --> 28:52.501
They may have used the
catering outfit to gain entry,

28:52.537 --> 28:53.636
but now that they're inside,

28:53.671 --> 28:55.437
our infiltrator may try to blend in.

28:55.473 --> 28:56.438
Yes, yes, very true.

28:56.474 --> 28:59.608
But, guys, most important...
I vouched for you.

28:59.644 --> 29:01.209
I have street cred to protect.

29:01.244 --> 29:03.010
So, please...

29:03.046 --> 29:04.612
Stay cool, yeah?

29:32.241 --> 29:34.040
- No champagne.
- I'll go get you some, yeah?

29:34.076 --> 29:35.539
- Yeah.
<i>- Tri.</i>

29:43.585 --> 29:44.850
Sniper!

29:44.885 --> 29:46.252
[Glass shatters]

29:46.287 --> 29:48.521
[Indistinct shouting]

29:48.556 --> 29:49.722
Are you okay?

29:49.757 --> 29:50.923
I... I think so.

29:50.958 --> 29:52.757
I think so.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.892
[Gasping]

29:54.928 --> 29:56.394
Somebody call an ambulance!

29:56.430 --> 29:58.563
Sergei! Sergei!

30:00.462 --> 30:02.821
Bullet went through and through.
Sergei's in surgery right now.

30:02.896 --> 30:04.062
He's expected to make a full recovery.

30:04.098 --> 30:06.160
- Anything on the shooter?
- Yeah, we found a sniper's nest

30:06.213 --> 30:08.066
in the building across the
street from the consulate.

30:08.102 --> 30:09.468
Any luck with security video?

30:09.503 --> 30:11.403
Disabled, but we found a janitor's uniform

30:11.439 --> 30:12.504
and the sniper's weapon.

30:12.540 --> 30:13.839
It's a Russian-made Dragunov.

30:13.874 --> 30:15.407
Did CSU pull prints or DNA?

30:15.443 --> 30:17.175
They're trying,
but I doubt they're gonna find anything.

30:17.211 --> 30:18.409
Whoever pulled this off is a pro.

30:18.445 --> 30:21.446
Which means I.D.ing our shooter
who most likely killed Grigory

30:21.481 --> 30:23.180
when he found out about this
whole assassination plot

30:23.216 --> 30:24.515
is gonna be damn near impossible.

30:24.551 --> 30:25.683
And it only gets worse.

30:25.719 --> 30:27.685
The Russians are claiming
that we created a distraction

30:27.721 --> 30:29.987
for their security team, which allowed for

30:30.022 --> 30:32.089
the assassination attempt
on their consul general.

30:32.125 --> 30:33.858
Well, hold up. You saved the consul's ass,

30:33.893 --> 30:34.992
and this is the thanks we get?

30:35.027 --> 30:37.794
Plus they're refusing any
further cooperation with us

30:37.829 --> 30:39.329
on Grigory's murder investigation.

30:39.365 --> 30:40.830
- Why would they do that?
- I don't...

30:40.866 --> 30:43.099
Because we are scared.

30:46.572 --> 30:48.772
It is easier to blame
America for our troubles,

30:48.807 --> 30:52.041
when the truth is we're fighting ourselves.

30:52.077 --> 30:54.009
- That supposed to be an apology?
- It didn't sound like one.

30:54.044 --> 30:55.177
The attempt on Oborin's life

30:55.212 --> 30:57.980
has shaken everyone in the
Russian diplomatic community.

30:58.015 --> 30:59.114
No one knows who to trust.

30:59.150 --> 31:02.818
And what little faith Oborin
has in me he has now lost.

31:02.853 --> 31:04.219
So now that you're all out of friends,

31:04.255 --> 31:05.821
you've come to us for help.

31:05.856 --> 31:06.689
Please, Captain.

31:06.724 --> 31:07.956
You told me all you wanted

31:07.992 --> 31:10.124
is to get the son of a bitch behind this.

31:10.160 --> 31:14.663
Help me get justice for Grigory,
Anya, and Sergei.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.153
Fine.

31:18.826 --> 31:21.003
But I have to bring someone else in.

31:23.562 --> 31:25.740
Get out of town.

31:25.776 --> 31:27.408
Long time, no see.

31:27.443 --> 31:28.975
Since that thing at the place.

31:29.011 --> 31:30.043
You mean the place with the guy?

31:30.078 --> 31:31.512
<i>Nyet.</i> Not that guy.

31:31.547 --> 31:32.579
The other guy.

31:32.615 --> 31:34.014
The guy with the big, massive head.

31:34.049 --> 31:36.183
Oh! That guy! I remember.

31:36.218 --> 31:38.352
Things didn't end well for him.

31:38.387 --> 31:39.853
They may not end well for you, either.

31:39.888 --> 31:42.222
Like I don't know that.

31:42.257 --> 31:44.223
So, right here, right now,

31:44.258 --> 31:46.337
lay all your cards on the table.

31:49.292 --> 31:51.397
The Russian consulate
in New York has a leak.

31:51.433 --> 31:52.598
- How bad?
- Critical.

31:52.634 --> 31:55.234
Sensitive intelligence is being
sold anonymously at auction.

31:55.269 --> 31:57.437
Two months ago, I activated Anya Mishkin

31:57.472 --> 31:58.904
to identify the traitor.

31:58.940 --> 32:00.505
I'm guessing the traitor got to her first.

32:00.541 --> 32:05.377
Anya's last communiqué said
she was close to unmasking him.

32:05.412 --> 32:08.117
But then she was killed in a car crash.

32:08.210 --> 32:10.149
Your traitor silenced her.

32:12.152 --> 32:13.752
We need names.

32:13.787 --> 32:15.086
Who's on your list?

32:15.121 --> 32:18.055
There's sharing, and then there's <i> sharing.</i>

32:19.792 --> 32:21.692
So, she's from the state department?

32:21.728 --> 32:23.227
Actually, that's just a cover.

32:23.262 --> 32:24.795
Cover for what? Who is she?

32:24.831 --> 32:26.364
Rita is many things,

32:26.399 --> 32:29.533
one of which is your stepmother.

32:32.323 --> 32:34.637
She's been helping me take down Loksat.

32:34.673 --> 32:36.806
I... I wanted to tell you sooner, but...

32:36.842 --> 32:37.841
Let me guess.

32:37.876 --> 32:40.276
You couldn't because you
needed to protect me.

32:40.964 --> 32:42.111
I'm so sorry.

32:42.146 --> 32:43.780
This is getting really old, Beckett.

32:43.815 --> 32:46.750
I know. Believe me, it is.

32:48.119 --> 32:49.675
Old.

32:50.154 --> 32:52.354
- It's very old.
- Thank you.

32:52.801 --> 32:54.790
Castle, you're absolutely right.

32:54.825 --> 32:56.425
Exactly. Wait. What...

32:56.460 --> 32:59.227
Right about... [Door closes]

32:59.263 --> 33:00.629
What was I right about?

33:00.664 --> 33:02.898
The report on the Dragunov sniper rifle

33:02.933 --> 33:06.268
said that the barrel twist
rate was 320 millimeters.

33:06.303 --> 33:08.103
But the newer version is 240, right?

33:08.138 --> 33:10.004
Yes, it was changed in the '90s.

33:10.039 --> 33:12.774
So then why would our
sniper use an older model

33:12.809 --> 33:15.443
when the newer one is so much
more powerful and accurate?

33:15.478 --> 33:16.778
It... it must have been the only thing

33:16.813 --> 33:18.646
the assassin had access to.

33:18.681 --> 33:21.482
Only who the hell leaves
around a Russian sniper rifle

33:21.518 --> 33:22.983
from the 1980s lying around?

33:23.019 --> 33:24.151
<i>Molniya.</i>

33:24.186 --> 33:25.119
Lightning?

33:25.154 --> 33:27.687
It's an old KGB code name for weapon caches

33:27.723 --> 33:30.290
planted in NATO countries to
support the agents in the field.

33:30.325 --> 33:32.826
After the dissolution of the Soviet union,

33:32.861 --> 33:33.960
many were abandoned.

33:33.995 --> 33:35.829
But someone in the field
would know where they were.

33:35.864 --> 33:38.465
Like Frank. Except he's all lawyered up.

33:38.500 --> 33:42.201
Yes, but I, too,
know where these old caches are.

33:42.237 --> 33:45.003
We search those caches,
we could find our killer.

33:51.579 --> 33:53.646
You remind me of Jackson.

33:54.515 --> 33:57.149
I find that very hard to believe.

33:57.184 --> 33:59.684
You have his eyes and
that mischievous grin.

33:59.719 --> 34:00.952
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

34:00.987 --> 34:02.464
There it is.

34:02.503 --> 34:04.155
How is he?

34:04.190 --> 34:06.023
Alive.

34:06.059 --> 34:08.326
In our business,
that's all you can hope for.

34:08.360 --> 34:12.163
Does he ever, um... mention me?

34:12.899 --> 34:14.728
- No.
- Ouch.

34:14.801 --> 34:16.667
You couldn't have lied?

34:16.702 --> 34:18.668
Doesn't mean he's not thinking of you.

34:18.704 --> 34:21.204
Just how he deals with
having to have to stay away.

34:21.239 --> 34:23.195
He does it for your own safety.

34:24.103 --> 34:27.777
I am so sick of people
pushing me away for my safety.

34:28.694 --> 34:30.813
Specifically Beckett, I'm assuming?

34:31.650 --> 34:33.416
Still a wee bit upset, huh?

34:34.437 --> 34:37.853
The anger flares up from time to time, yes.

34:37.889 --> 34:39.554
She did it out of love.

34:39.591 --> 34:40.822
Oh, I know.

34:40.858 --> 34:41.987
I know.

34:42.726 --> 34:44.378
At the end of the day,

34:44.471 --> 34:46.529
she's worth it.

34:48.433 --> 34:50.065
I'm glad I met you, Richard.

34:50.101 --> 34:51.733
I'm glad I met you, too.

34:51.768 --> 34:53.234
But you didn't. Remember that.

34:53.270 --> 34:55.170
No, your secret is safe.

34:56.774 --> 35:00.842
Am I going to see you or my dad again?

35:06.663 --> 35:08.582
He's so very proud of you.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.334
Hey, guys. You're gonna want to see this.

35:27.369 --> 35:28.601
I've been scrubbing traffic cam footage

35:28.637 --> 35:31.170
at the addresses of all the old
cold war caches in the city.

35:31.206 --> 35:32.038
What did you find?

35:32.073 --> 35:33.807
Well, you have to see it to believe it.

35:35.301 --> 35:36.876
This is from yesterday.

35:42.450 --> 35:43.749
- Who's that?
- I'll show you.

35:43.784 --> 35:45.064
Wait for it.

35:45.182 --> 35:47.853
Remember our cold war
spies Anatoly and Anya?

35:49.323 --> 35:51.096
This is her now.

35:51.241 --> 35:53.625
This is Anya Mishkin.

35:53.661 --> 35:55.794
Grigory's mother.

35:55.830 --> 35:57.262
Beckett: But she died in the car crash.

35:57.297 --> 35:58.796
Nope. She's alive and well.

35:58.832 --> 36:01.699
She must have taken the
Dragunov from the gun cache.

36:01.735 --> 36:03.601
Now we know who our assassin is.

36:07.959 --> 36:09.131
Beckett: Do you expect me to believe

36:09.210 --> 36:11.506
that you had no idea Anya was still alive?

36:11.529 --> 36:12.957
I swear it. For all I know,

36:13.010 --> 36:15.331
Anya's the leak in the
Russian consulate all along!

36:15.366 --> 36:18.966
And she faked her death
just to throw you off?

36:19.002 --> 36:20.335
I don't know.

36:21.495 --> 36:22.504
[Knock on door] Captain, that bolo

36:22.539 --> 36:25.624
that I put on the stolen car
that Anya got into paid off.

36:25.875 --> 36:28.042
- Unis pulled her over on the l.I.E.
- Do they have her in custody?

36:28.077 --> 36:29.648
Bringing her in right now.

36:32.349 --> 36:33.881
I'll question her.

36:33.916 --> 36:37.684
Beckett: So,
- what was the endgame, Anya?

36:37.720 --> 36:38.952
Money for selling secrets

36:38.987 --> 36:42.589
in a Cayman account so that you
and Frank could sit on a beach?

36:42.624 --> 36:45.592
You have no idea what
you are talking about.

36:45.627 --> 36:48.662
But the price for this
fantasy getaway was steep...

36:48.697 --> 36:50.096
Your son's life.

36:50.131 --> 36:51.832
So who killed him? Was it Frank?

36:51.867 --> 36:52.865
Or did you do it yourself?

36:52.900 --> 36:55.568
Everything I've done was
in order to save him.

36:55.603 --> 36:57.570
Grigory found out the truth, didn't he?

36:57.605 --> 36:59.739
And he threatened to expose you.

36:59.774 --> 37:00.873
That's why you killed him.

37:00.908 --> 37:04.042
The thing I don't understand is,
why did you stick around

37:04.078 --> 37:06.379
for the assassination
attempt at the consulate?

37:06.414 --> 37:09.181
All I had left was vengeance.

37:09.216 --> 37:10.715
What did Oborin do to you?

37:10.751 --> 37:12.183
I wasn't aiming for Oborin.

37:12.218 --> 37:13.694
Sergei.

37:14.254 --> 37:15.687
You were aiming for your husband?

37:15.722 --> 37:17.522
And if you hadn't interfered,

37:17.557 --> 37:19.724
he would be dead now, as he should be.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.626
Vasily: [Sighs] I must say, Rick,

37:21.661 --> 37:23.762
your novels don't do Beckett justice.

37:23.797 --> 37:24.863
She's just getting started.

37:24.898 --> 37:26.197
[Sighs]

37:26.232 --> 37:28.732
I am not the devil you think I am.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.100
I am not a traitor.

37:30.135 --> 37:31.635
- But your husband is?
- Yes.

37:31.670 --> 37:33.804
Sergei is the one who's been
selling our trade secrets

37:33.839 --> 37:35.706
to economic competitors... I have proof.

37:35.741 --> 37:37.641
And why didn't you tell Vasily?
Was it love?

37:37.676 --> 37:38.809
Not love.

37:38.844 --> 37:40.310
I held my tongue

37:40.345 --> 37:44.781
because my husband is very well connected.

37:44.816 --> 37:47.149
Much more so than Vasily.

37:47.184 --> 37:50.352
Sadly, Rick, this is all true.

37:51.589 --> 37:52.622
If I had turned Sergei in,

37:52.657 --> 37:55.157
he would have used his
political muscle to bury me.

37:55.192 --> 37:56.992
I would have been the one on trial,
not him.

37:57.028 --> 37:59.161
Laws mean nothing in Russia.

37:59.196 --> 38:00.896
All that matters is power.

38:00.931 --> 38:03.598
So you faked your death
to protect yourself.

38:04.367 --> 38:06.134
But Grigory became suspicious.

38:06.169 --> 38:09.438
He got on to the truth
of what Sergei was doing.

38:10.941 --> 38:13.742
Anya,
are you saying that Sergei killed Grigory?

38:13.777 --> 38:16.044
They're not blood.

38:19.214 --> 38:22.483
Grigory's biological father
died before his birth.

38:22.518 --> 38:26.186
Sergei never truly bonded with Grigory.

38:26.221 --> 38:30.123
I followed Grigory to
that apartment building,

38:30.159 --> 38:32.493
but I was too late.

38:32.528 --> 38:37.597
I saw Sergei running away, and then...

38:37.632 --> 38:41.668
I found my poor boy.

38:41.703 --> 38:44.838
And why did you try to get
revenge with a sniper rifle?

38:44.873 --> 38:47.707
Because Sergei never left the
consulate after the murder.

38:47.742 --> 38:50.543
That night was my best chance,
my last chance!

38:50.579 --> 38:53.846
Soon he will go back to
Russia and be out of my reach.

38:53.881 --> 38:56.314
I promise you I will do
everything in my power

38:56.350 --> 38:58.350
to make sure that he is brought to justice.

38:58.385 --> 39:02.888
My husband has full diplomatic immunity.

39:03.772 --> 39:06.859
You are powerless, just like I am.

39:06.894 --> 39:09.078
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

39:11.097 --> 39:12.797
You have no business here, Captain.

39:12.832 --> 39:13.865
Mr. Oborin, are you aware

39:13.900 --> 39:16.667
that Sergei has been selling
Russian trade secrets?

39:16.703 --> 39:18.870
Captain, this is a Russian matter.

39:18.905 --> 39:19.737
But he killed Grigory just...

39:19.772 --> 39:22.039
And it is a Russian matter.

39:22.074 --> 39:24.809
If you'll excuse me,
I have a plane to catch.

39:24.844 --> 39:26.576
I've been recalled to Moscow,

39:26.612 --> 39:29.813
where I shall pay a small
fine and begin my retirement.

39:29.848 --> 39:31.915
A fine? That's his punishment?

39:31.950 --> 39:33.383
Could you do me a favor?

39:33.418 --> 39:36.185
Could you please tell my wife I said...

39:36.221 --> 39:37.787
[Speaking Russian]

39:41.860 --> 39:44.192
[Speaks Russian]

39:44.228 --> 39:45.227
What does that mean?

39:45.262 --> 39:46.829
"Small thieves get hanged.

39:46.864 --> 39:48.430
Great ones go free."

39:48.465 --> 39:49.932
It's an old Russian proverb.

39:49.967 --> 39:51.266
Mr. Oborin, please.

39:51.301 --> 39:52.935
Revoke Sergei's immunity.

39:52.970 --> 39:54.870
Have him stand trial for Grigory's murder.

39:54.906 --> 39:57.540
It would set a very dangerous example.

39:57.575 --> 39:59.841
You see, Captain, uh, Russian justice

39:59.876 --> 40:03.210
is very, very... complicated.

40:06.382 --> 40:10.084
Oh, here's somebody who
would like to say goodbye.

40:10.119 --> 40:12.253
You two look so unhappy.

40:12.288 --> 40:14.422
This breaks my heart. [Sighs]

40:14.457 --> 40:16.757
You're, uh, leaving town?
Same plane as Sergei?

40:16.792 --> 40:18.926
Yes. Nine hours to Moscow.

40:18.961 --> 40:20.561
[Sighs, chuckles]

40:20.596 --> 40:21.929
But plenty of time to work on

40:21.964 --> 40:24.130
our "Heat and Ice" collaboration, yes?

40:24.166 --> 40:26.967
In fact...

40:27.002 --> 40:28.468
I have an idea for the ending.

40:28.503 --> 40:30.003
- Vasily, I don't know if...
- It goes like this.

40:30.039 --> 40:31.504
Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook

40:31.540 --> 40:33.806
think the evil Russian has gotten away.

40:33.841 --> 40:37.009
What they don't know is
Vladimir ice has set in motion

40:37.045 --> 40:38.510
a plan to send the murderer

40:38.546 --> 40:41.280
to live out the rest of his miserable life

40:41.315 --> 40:45.184
at a lonely Russian outpost, Oymyakon.

40:45.219 --> 40:46.786
I've heard of that town.

40:46.821 --> 40:48.754
That's the coldest place on earth.

40:48.790 --> 40:51.590
It takes four days to warm
the ground with bonfire

40:51.625 --> 40:53.024
before they can bury their dead.

40:53.060 --> 40:54.125
Is that where Sergei is headed?

40:54.160 --> 40:57.996
In Russia,
there are far worse places than prison.

40:58.031 --> 41:02.634
Like I said,
Russian justice is very complicated.

41:02.669 --> 41:04.970
[Chuckles]

41:07.873 --> 41:10.173
Come here.
[Laughs]

41:10.209 --> 41:12.275
Wow. Strong.

41:12.311 --> 41:13.844
This was fun, no?

41:13.879 --> 41:15.445
- Yeah.
- We do it again sometime.

41:15.481 --> 41:17.047
Call first.
[Chuckles]

41:17.083 --> 41:17.881
<i>Do svidaniya.</i>

41:17.917 --> 41:19.617
You, too.

41:19.652 --> 41:20.851
Kate.

41:20.886 --> 41:22.820
Oh, no. Come on. [Chuckles]

41:22.855 --> 41:24.187
Thank you.

41:25.156 --> 41:27.056
Thank you.

41:27.092 --> 41:28.124
All right.

41:28.159 --> 41:30.994
Oh. [Chuckles] Yes, yes.

41:31.930 --> 41:33.830
[Laughs]

41:35.934 --> 41:38.067
[Chuckles]

41:38.510 --> 41:41.004
Not exactly the ending
that I was hoping for,

41:41.039 --> 41:43.204
but I guess it'll have to do.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.407
You know, Beckett,
we've kissed in six different countries.

41:46.443 --> 41:48.810
- Really? You're keeping count?
- You're not?

41:48.846 --> 41:52.380
Anyway,
one country we haven't kissed in is Russia.

41:52.415 --> 41:56.417
And technically, right now,
we are on Russian soil.

41:56.453 --> 41:57.886
You know, there is one other thing

41:57.921 --> 42:00.104
that we've done in six different countries.

42:01.724 --> 42:03.157
<i>Idi syuda kroshka.</i>

42:03.192 --> 42:04.224
What does that mean?

42:04.260 --> 42:06.627
Means follow me and find out.

42:08.264 --> 42:10.230
Find a Russian translation app.
