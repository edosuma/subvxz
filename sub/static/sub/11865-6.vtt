01:02.312 --> 01:04.995
When I was a kid, I took ballroom dancing.

01:05.281 --> 01:07.468
My mom said it would stay with me for life,

01:07.503 --> 01:11.445
but all I remember is one-two-three, one-two-three...

01:11.578 --> 01:13.923
- What do you mean, no blueberry pancakes?
- They're seasonal.

01:13.996 --> 01:15.782
Explain something to me. Are the blueberries fresh?

01:16.696 --> 01:17.502
They're dehydrated?

01:18.076 --> 01:20.144
How can something harvested months ago be seasonal?

01:20.220 --> 01:22.045
I don't make the rules. I just play by them.

01:22.146 --> 01:23.028
Something else you want?

01:23.236 --> 01:24.993
I had my heart set on blueberry pancakes.

01:25.064 --> 01:26.831
- Are you pregnant?
- I certainly hope so.

01:27.067 --> 01:29.781
I'll have the Jayne Mansfield and grapefruit juice.

01:29.822 --> 01:30.650
The Jayne Mansfield?

01:31.696 --> 01:33.318
A blueberry muffin, but just the top of the muffin.

01:33.830 --> 01:36.226
So... blueberry muffins, you have?

01:36.289 --> 01:37.900
Right, right, right. You just play by them.

01:39.185 --> 01:40.409
I am fucked.

01:40.476 --> 01:43.429
You're fucked? My post-it is at an ice skating rink,

01:43.460 --> 01:44.956
and all I've got is this jacket.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.357
Reaping 101--learn to layer. You never know what the day might bring.

01:48.476 --> 01:51.730
Maybe you could pray her up a pair of mittens and a cute scarf.

01:51.838 --> 01:53.855
That's not what prayer is for, Roxy.

01:53.972 --> 01:56.814
It's not for making yourself feel better after you fuck up.

01:56.963 --> 01:59.184
- That's what I use it for.
- What's going on between you two ?

01:59.252 --> 02:02.574
Ask the nice little catholic girl who likes to steal jewelry from the dead.

02:02.646 --> 02:04.775
Hey, I needed this. Besides, she was mean.

02:04.847 --> 02:07.464
The mean woman's family thinks the cops stole it

02:07.500 --> 02:10.536
off her fat, dead neck at the crime scene, and they want it back.

02:11.523 --> 02:14.023
- Make her give it back, Rube.
- No way.

02:14.399 --> 02:17.801
I'm having enough trouble with my breakfast this morning.

02:17.915 --> 02:22.168
Good lord, I beseech thee, two scrambled eggs and a small O.J., Amen.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.628
Why do you persecute me?

02:24.033 --> 02:25.081
One Jane Mansfield.

02:28.795 --> 02:29.670
Made your decision?

02:29.792 --> 02:32.619
I never thought the day would come, but I have no idea what I want to eat.

02:32.679 --> 02:35.123
Go with bacon. You never regret bacon.

02:35.346 --> 02:38.323
Oh, it doesn't feel like a bacon day. When did you run out of blueberries?

02:38.389 --> 02:40.069
10 minutes ago. Do you know what you want?

02:40.155 --> 02:40.969
Better timing.

02:41.753 --> 02:42.516
Salt.

02:45.001 --> 02:45.886
Move that puck!

02:49.387 --> 02:50.026
Go!

02:52.003 --> 02:53.063
Good shot, Andy.

02:53.437 --> 02:54.696
You suck.

02:55.388 --> 02:57.907
My mother has a better slap shot, and she's dead.

03:00.088 --> 03:01.807
You see those little girls over here?

03:02.893 --> 03:05.960
I'd rather have one of them on my power play tomorrow night.

03:09.135 --> 03:10.630
Hey, coach Henson.

03:12.315 --> 03:13.918
Mama, I'm coming home.

03:16.523 --> 03:18.039
Give me two minutes, Brian.

03:18.151 --> 03:21.356
- Can't do it, coach. Time's up.
- Time's up. Got to go.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.625
All right, get out of here.

03:23.931 --> 03:25.846
I don't want to see any of you ever again,

03:26.435 --> 03:27.642
except you, Andy.

03:27.856 --> 03:28.847
Get over here.

03:34.009 --> 03:35.126
What are you doing out here?

03:35.231 --> 03:36.107
I'm playing hockey.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.623
- Hey, how you doing?
- Fine.

03:40.664 --> 03:42.841
Do you want to play hockey or talk to pretty girls?

03:43.040 --> 03:44.243
Um... both.

03:44.382 --> 03:45.518
You're pissing it away, Andy.

03:45.754 --> 03:47.831
You've got it, and you're pissing it away.

03:48.452 --> 03:49.916
Oops, sorry, coach.

03:50.265 --> 03:51.825
You can go back to your rant.

03:53.501 --> 03:54.873
Any of you girls play hockey?

03:55.855 --> 03:56.362
You.

03:59.782 --> 04:01.125
- What's your name?
- Melissa.

04:01.481 --> 04:03.401
Do you think you can handle a hockey stick better than him?

04:03.577 --> 04:06.490
No, but I bet I can play better than you.

04:11.797 --> 04:13.366
Pass me the puck when I tell you to.

04:16.564 --> 04:17.411
Now.

04:25.000 --> 04:25.997
Coach, watch out!

04:26.335 --> 04:26.990
Oh, my god!

04:32.006 --> 04:33.063
He shoots...

04:34.973 --> 04:36.790
he does not score.

04:42.454 --> 04:43.543
Am I dead?

04:44.813 --> 04:46.697
As dead as I've seen in a while.

04:49.191 --> 04:49.959
Are you dead?

04:50.216 --> 04:54.189
I was killed about a year ago, so I'm dead...ish.

04:54.244 --> 04:55.222
Why was I killed?

04:55.677 --> 04:56.369
I don't know.

04:57.061 --> 04:59.062
I don't make the rules. I just play by them.

04:59.359 --> 05:02.708
Chalk it up to bad timing, coach. Come on.

05:03.701 --> 05:05.821
Life and death was a kind of game,

05:05.924 --> 05:08.141
kind of like "duck, duck, goose."

05:08.941 --> 05:11.637
Duck, duck... dead.

05:11.780 --> 05:15.810
We're all just a step away from that dreaded tap on the head.

05:20.940 --> 05:22.871
We're all just trying not to get caught.

05:25.949 --> 05:27.253
Am I interrupting something?

05:27.335 --> 05:30.460
- Uh, no, I was just working on...
- fivesies?

05:30.572 --> 05:31.427
Foursies.

05:31.570 --> 05:34.968
Millie, millie, millie, have you finished anything this morning?

05:35.082 --> 05:37.886
Actually, I did finish something...

05:38.077 --> 05:38.954
Someone.

05:40.074 --> 05:41.534
Big assignment, Millie.

05:41.606 --> 05:43.150
We've got a new pharmaceuticals account.

05:43.191 --> 05:44.923
They're about a week from a major drug launch.

05:44.964 --> 05:47.994
They're terribly in need of a top-notch staffer. Got that?

05:48.128 --> 05:51.471
Blah-blah, type memo, go get a mocha, send memo.

05:51.533 --> 05:52.260
Got it.

05:52.847 --> 05:56.029
These are the three applicants you have to choose from.

05:56.934 --> 05:57.703
Back up.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.057
Did you just say "choose"? Me?

06:00.150 --> 06:02.577
No, I said you choose.

06:02.670 --> 06:04.148
You're in a new position now.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.653
You're like the prettiest girl at the prom,

06:06.745 --> 06:09.034
or the sluttiest girl, if you went to catholic school.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.334
You get to pick.

06:10.502 --> 06:11.455
What if I'm neither?

06:11.879 --> 06:14.230
Decisions must be made.

06:14.761 --> 06:19.540
Winners... make decisions, Millie.

06:22.560 --> 06:28.167
Winners make decisions, but nothing before my mocha, breakfast of champions.

06:30.644 --> 06:31.981
We just sold your house.

06:32.504 --> 06:34.228
Congratulations, you two.

06:34.513 --> 06:35.949
Well, what do you think, Reggie?

06:36.225 --> 06:38.453
I think high-fives are in order.

06:38.566 --> 06:41.100
- I don't think so.
- Okay, then.

06:41.438 --> 06:44.593
- So how much did we make?
- A lot.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.747
- How much did she make?
- She did well.

06:47.797 --> 06:49.522
Do you want to know what my commission is, Reggie?

06:51.728 --> 06:52.467
Go ahead.

06:53.398 --> 06:55.299
I make 5% of the selling price.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.670
What a scam. I want your job when I grow up.

06:57.799 --> 06:58.687
No, you don't.

07:01.222 --> 07:02.548
So are we rich?

07:02.707 --> 07:06.592
I usually suggest holding off on the celebration until closing escrow.

07:07.432 --> 07:08.627
What's "escrow"?

07:09.117 --> 07:12.911
- It's a kind of in-between time, like...
- Purgatory? Limbo?

07:14.022 --> 07:15.124
She's a reader.

07:16.746 --> 07:18.942
It's like bringing a sack lunch to school.

07:19.009 --> 07:23.053
Your lunch is in the bag, but you have to wait until the bell rings to eat it.

07:23.898 --> 07:28.118
if you just go ahead and give me that paperwork, Joy, I can skedaddle.

07:28.174 --> 07:29.331
Where are we going to live?

07:29.424 --> 07:34.293
Well, escrow lasts for 45 days, so we have a month and a half to find a place.

07:38.909 --> 07:39.884
wait, wait.

07:41.001 --> 07:42.209
Hey, man, what's the deal?

07:42.260 --> 07:43.764
What the fuck, have you got a post-it here, too?

07:43.921 --> 07:44.746
What is this?

07:44.892 --> 07:47.238
"707 Hanley Boulevard."

07:47.335 --> 07:49.135
"707 Hanley. Used records cheap"?

07:49.505 --> 07:53.519
Man, that shit ain't even worth it unless you're into that vintage '60s british thing.

07:53.768 --> 07:58.135
Wait. I'm a vintage '60s british thing, so fuck off. Go on.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.092
Anyone home?

08:04.296 --> 08:09.267
So, Michael, I see from your resume that you're a major in chemistry.

08:09.579 --> 08:13.190
Yes, so if there's any technical stuff that comes up, I'm your man.

08:14.148 --> 08:17.259
This is a highly pressured situation, Michael.

08:17.608 --> 08:19.922
Lunateca is looking for a self-...

08:23.988 --> 08:26.719
...Starter with great interpersonal skills.

08:26.743 --> 08:28.052
Do you think you're that person, Michael?

08:28.130 --> 08:29.614
I know I'm that person, Millie.

08:31.867 --> 08:36.813
Lunateca is bringing a new painkiller to the market within the next few days,

08:36.859 --> 08:39.900
and they're hoping to hire someone before the drug is...

08:42.527 --> 08:43.105
...released.

08:43.157 --> 08:46.181
- Michael, you are farting.
- I'm aware of that.

08:46.228 --> 08:49.300
You do realize this isn'nt a job at a morning radio show?

08:52.424 --> 08:54.534
I'll take that as a no.

08:54.600 --> 08:55.235
Listen.

08:55.808 --> 08:57.693
I have irritable Bowel syndrome, okay?

08:58.112 --> 08:59.126
It's not a joke.

08:59.245 --> 09:02.936
In fact, it's protected by the americans with disabilities' act...

09:04.574 --> 09:09.177
So don't even think about trying to get rid of me for this.

09:16.545 --> 09:18.439
I appreciate you coming in.

09:18.634 --> 09:20.037
- Leave the door open?
- Please.

09:31.592 --> 09:34.854
Yeah, they're all for sale. Anything you see.

09:36.754 --> 09:37.890
You break it, you buy it.

09:39.017 --> 09:42.216
- How much for that one, mate?
- Not that one. Anything else.

09:45.120 --> 09:45.851
How about this one?

09:45.934 --> 09:48.822
That's right, anything but that one.

09:49.010 --> 09:50.292
Are you selling your records or what?

09:50.471 --> 09:52.764
Well, I'm always a bit clearer after lunch.

09:56.208 --> 10:00.265
The church yard at Wembley, 1965. Fucking hell.

10:01.103 --> 10:04.417
They did not do live recordings of this show, man.

10:04.485 --> 10:07.320
- The band made their own.
- Yeah.

10:08.354 --> 10:10.838
You knew someone in the church yard? Fuck off.

10:17.458 --> 10:18.389
Did you?

10:19.245 --> 10:20.208
All my life.

10:23.339 --> 10:24.088
Bloody hell.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.394
Bloody hell, you're Gideon Jeffries.

10:30.028 --> 10:33.418
Don't tell me you're another long-lost child of some groupie, because I'm tapped out.

10:33.464 --> 10:35.388
Why don't you try Jagger? He's still touring.

10:38.127 --> 10:38.778
Sorry.

10:39.613 --> 10:42.152
Look, I-- I'm just such a tremendous,

10:42.428 --> 10:43.840
bloody fan of yours, man.

10:43.918 --> 10:44.589
I mean...

10:44.953 --> 10:46.914
this wasn't even a concert, was it?

10:46.969 --> 10:48.060
Do you know what I mean? It was a...

10:48.127 --> 10:50.380
it was a... fucking miracle.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.963
That concert was 40 years ago.

10:52.403 --> 10:53.821
You've got to be thinking about something else, mate.

10:54.107 --> 10:57.415
Yeah, my uncle used to reminisce about it all the time.

10:57.512 --> 10:58.402
Didn't shut up about it.

10:58.485 --> 10:59.382
- Uncle?
- Yeah.

11:00.271 --> 11:01.589
- Chinese food.
- Brilliant.

11:01.859 --> 11:04.725
Listen... do you have, like, 20 bucks on you?

11:05.162 --> 11:07.297
I've got 20 bucks. It's a bit early for chinese,

11:07.358 --> 11:08.720
but anything for Gideon Jeffries.

11:10.363 --> 11:11.352
That's a parking ticket.

11:11.501 --> 11:12.710
That's a parking ticket, yeah,

11:12.817 --> 11:14.888
and you know what's fucked up about it? I don't even fucking have a car.

11:15.029 --> 11:16.520
I don't know why I've got a parking ticket--

11:16.625 --> 11:17.654
Do you have a 20 on you?

11:17.711 --> 11:19.569
I've got a fucking... I've got a 20, mate.

11:19.733 --> 11:21.213
I've got--fuck, what the fuck?

11:21.686 --> 11:23.400
- There's a 20.
- All right, cheers. Take a record.

11:23.655 --> 11:26.397
- Just not that one.
- Gideon Jeffries, fuck.

11:28.510 --> 11:33.051
Egg rolls, friend. Hey, you like chinese?

11:33.097 --> 11:34.637
You look like you like chinese. Take a card.

11:35.027 --> 11:35.713
It's okay.

11:41.228 --> 11:42.302
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

11:42.744 --> 11:43.536
Can I offer you a bite?

11:44.238 --> 11:45.477
I'm trying to cut back, mate.

11:45.620 --> 11:48.007
All that msg, toxic... really bad for you.

11:50.879 --> 11:51.975
What did you say your name was?

11:52.272 --> 11:53.066
Mason.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.415
I used to be Gideon Jeffries.

11:59.173 --> 12:00.094
I remember.

12:01.624 --> 12:04.375
- I can't believe you sold our lily pad.
- Excuse me?

12:04.826 --> 12:09.771
Mrs. Rodriguez said that frogs like to stay on one lily pad until another lily pad drifts by.

12:10.243 --> 12:11.968
She said they don't really like to swim.

12:12.101 --> 12:13.822
That's where the danger is, the pond.

12:14.713 --> 12:16.059
What--what is-- what is your point?

12:16.582 --> 12:18.374
Ribbit, we're in the pond.

12:18.819 --> 12:20.790
We are not in the pond.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.343
Excuse us.

12:28.214 --> 12:29.013
What is that?

12:30.098 --> 12:32.391
Some people downtown live in places like that.

12:32.833 --> 12:35.382
- What kind of people?
- Downtown people.

12:38.286 --> 12:39.207
You know, how about--

12:39.776 --> 12:40.641
just for fun--

12:41.372 --> 12:42.969
we go look at a lily pad?

12:44.796 --> 12:46.350
You get me job.

12:49.237 --> 12:54.244
Usually, we warm up with a little small talk before the... commands begin.

12:54.300 --> 12:58.264
I'm sorry. My english is not perfect. Perhaps others are more polite.

12:58.479 --> 12:59.790
Hmm, you'd be surprised.

13:01.542 --> 13:03.475
I didn't do it. It was the guy before you.

13:03.599 --> 13:07.050
- Anyway, you're russian?
- Chechnyan. Big difference.

13:07.111 --> 13:09.324
- You know where this is? Chechnya?
- Not really.

13:09.457 --> 13:12.426
This job, Anton, is not entry level.

13:12.483 --> 13:16.399
It's going to be very stressful, a pressure-filled situation.

13:16.435 --> 13:21.519
I was doctor in Chechnya. Then war came. My hospital was bombed. I was tortured.

13:22.277 --> 13:24.581
Electrodes were attached to my testicles.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.318
So you're all set on the pressure thing.

13:30.255 --> 13:32.655
I don't get job, lose work Visa, go back.

13:32.988 --> 13:34.467
- You get me job?
- Maybe.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.603
- Want a donut?
- I need job, not donuts.

13:39.813 --> 13:41.727
I get job, buy donuts.

13:42.794 --> 13:43.883
Krispy Kremes.

13:48.558 --> 13:50.924
This is awesome. You can skateboard in your own living room.

13:51.005 --> 13:51.907
But you wouldn't.

13:52.941 --> 13:56.304
Anyway, people that work downtown love living here.

13:56.760 --> 13:58.871
- You work downtown?
- She doesn't work anywhere.

13:59.018 --> 13:59.787
She's a mom.

14:01.615 --> 14:02.807
I used to work.

14:03.745 --> 14:06.493
- Where would I sleep?
- Oh, your bedroom? That way.

14:11.465 --> 14:12.499
So where are you living now?

14:13.232 --> 14:15.065
Do you know Beatrice Lane?

14:15.142 --> 14:17.108
No, and Beatrice Lane does not know me.

14:20.604 --> 14:24.224
So is it... is it safe down here?

14:24.321 --> 14:26.948
Well, during the day, everybody rushes around with their work,

14:27.010 --> 14:29.584
and during the night, everybody rushes around with their play,

14:29.989 --> 14:33.036
so you can be by yourself, but you're never alone.

14:33.318 --> 14:36.093
Hmm. That sounds nice.

14:36.344 --> 14:37.029
Yeah.

14:39.308 --> 14:40.435
It is just the two of you?

14:40.568 --> 14:44.438
Yep, that's what it is. Yeah.

14:45.698 --> 14:46.809
My room's huge.

14:47.766 --> 14:48.969
Do you allow dogs?

14:49.246 --> 14:50.986
You're not allowed to move in without one.

14:51.750 --> 14:52.302
Cool.

14:53.147 --> 14:54.089
I guess she likes it.

14:55.559 --> 14:56.666
Seems that way.

14:57.558 --> 14:58.933
And she doesn't like anything.

15:01.631 --> 15:03.619
So did you sell your place on Beatrice Lane?

15:03.870 --> 15:05.318
I'm in escrow.

15:07.765 --> 15:09.046
Do you know what you need to do?

15:09.824 --> 15:11.083
You need to cruise by,

15:11.507 --> 15:13.080
check out the neighborhood at night,

15:13.203 --> 15:14.156
see if you like it.

15:16.039 --> 15:18.563
Your room has a fireplace in it and a view of the sound.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.024
- Hey, what's the name of your dog?
- J.D.

15:22.337 --> 15:25.112
- J.D. What does "J.D." Stand for?
- "Just dog."

15:25.235 --> 15:26.162
Just dog...

15:28.004 --> 15:29.474
I like Golden retrievers.

15:34.826 --> 15:36.754
So what did her family say?

15:37.293 --> 15:39.883
You mean the grieving, stolen-cross family?

15:39.981 --> 15:40.462
Yeah.

15:40.574 --> 15:44.645
They came to the precinct and complained. They think the cops stole it.

15:45.224 --> 15:47.050
It's an heirloom or some shit.

15:47.205 --> 15:48.884
The fucking thing is older than you are.

15:48.953 --> 15:51.187
- There's no need to be mean.
- Just give it back.

15:51.244 --> 15:52.868
There's no law that says I have to.

15:52.933 --> 15:55.812
Actually, there are several laws, Daisy Adair,

15:55.888 --> 15:57.839
including you-know-who's.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.772
No need to bring him into it. I'm keeping the cross.

16:01.045 --> 16:02.290
Well, I'll say one thing.

16:02.626 --> 16:04.055
You've got good taste.

16:04.941 --> 16:07.029
- It's a beautiful cross.
- Thank you.

16:07.153 --> 16:11.576
The thing's going to burn a hole clean through your neck to the back of your spine.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.450
So he was far--

16:17.265 --> 16:19.694
breaking wind through the whole interview?

16:19.743 --> 16:21.737
Just ripping one after another.

16:22.822 --> 16:25.125
- That's funny, Crystal?
- No.

16:25.668 --> 16:27.014
It is a little funny.

16:27.117 --> 16:27.854
Millie.

16:28.134 --> 16:29.202
I'm sorry.

16:29.436 --> 16:32.754
Irritable Bowel syndrome is a serious affliction.

16:32.973 --> 16:36.843
Most people don't know this, but Marilyn Monroe had I.B.S.

16:36.921 --> 16:40.684
- Is that what blew her skirt up?
- That is in poor taste, Millie.

16:40.955 --> 16:42.865
I'm sorry... again.

16:43.951 --> 16:46.777
Knock, knock. I have an appointment with Millie.

16:47.038 --> 16:49.823
- Margaret Paddington? 
- As in the bear?

16:50.443 --> 16:52.025
As...in the bear.

16:52.204 --> 16:55.276
Hi. I'm Millie. Thanks for coming in.

16:55.410 --> 16:57.774
I can't tell you how much this interview means to me.

16:58.293 --> 17:01.031
At my age, I'm lucky to even get a call returned.

17:01.128 --> 17:04.026
Oh, don't be silly. We're happy to have you.

17:04.214 --> 17:05.781
I guess it's true what they say about

17:06.022 --> 17:09.089
the magical superpowers a woman gets when she turns 50.

17:09.740 --> 17:10.502
What's that?

17:11.405 --> 17:13.314
She can disappear.

17:15.406 --> 17:20.026
Um, I took 10 years off... to...

17:20.579 --> 17:24.317
care for my aging parents who have now passed.

17:24.404 --> 17:25.326
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.435
Well, I should never have left the work force.

17:27.497 --> 17:29.015
It's so hard now to get back in.

17:29.063 --> 17:30.727
I should never have jumped off that train,

17:31.204 --> 17:34.178
and now I've lived with death for so long that...

17:35.247 --> 17:37.292
well, I need to feel alive.

17:40.425 --> 17:42.059
Well, let's see what we can do for you.

17:46.045 --> 17:48.094
Gideon Jeffries, I just want to...

17:48.167 --> 17:49.595
I just want to tell you how great you are.

17:49.681 --> 17:51.877
I mean, you've invented the power stance.

17:52.068 --> 17:53.445
Do you mind if I just...

18:04.527 --> 18:07.453
Thank you, Baton Rouge.

18:09.701 --> 18:12.086
- Do it for me? Please.
- No.

18:15.865 --> 18:17.816
Power stance days are behind me.

18:19.204 --> 18:22.076
Right, yeah, I'm sorry. It's stupid. I'm sorry for asking, man.

18:22.773 --> 18:25.030
No, no, don't be sorry. It's not stupid.

18:26.469 --> 18:28.711
See, the Who started all this nonsense.

18:29.182 --> 18:32.081
Townshend--just another rock star affectation.

18:32.143 --> 18:34.329
He didn't actually produce more sound that way.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.453
But it was so fucking cool wasn't it?

18:37.513 --> 18:39.091
Everything looks cool when you're 27.

18:39.137 --> 18:40.668
What the fuck do you know? You're still a kid.

18:40.724 --> 18:42.638
Do you mind if I eat my chinese now?

18:42.898 --> 18:44.820
Can I just ask you one question before you...

18:47.492 --> 18:49.331
- Before what?
- Nothing.

18:50.554 --> 18:54.558
Anyway, my...my uncle, I swear to god,

18:54.625 --> 18:55.853
he worshipped you, man.

18:57.271 --> 18:59.617
You know, and he--he ended up...

19:00.343 --> 19:02.135
chasing this permanent high.

19:04.481 --> 19:06.498
Anyway, he thought that if he's going to go out,

19:06.565 --> 19:08.059
he's going to go out like his heroes.

19:09.309 --> 19:10.896
You know, he's going to go out like those...

19:11.884 --> 19:13.850
well, those blokes from the church yard.

19:14.019 --> 19:15.315
How did it turn out for your uncle?

19:15.508 --> 19:17.450
Not too well. He ended up in a church yard.

19:17.583 --> 19:18.898
Well, doesn't it always?

19:24.387 --> 19:26.656
- What? 
- Did you ever get there?

19:28.156 --> 19:29.379
The ultimate high?

19:34.269 --> 19:35.410
I'm still waiting.

19:40.910 --> 19:41.719
Good luck.

19:42.052 --> 19:43.398
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo,

19:43.469 --> 19:45.087
catch a tiger by its toe.

19:45.159 --> 19:46.993
If he hollers, let him go.

19:47.404 --> 19:50.607
My boss said to pick the very best one,

19:50.673 --> 19:52.983
but who the fuck is that?

19:58.848 --> 20:02.014
Me and Dad. Two days before he passed. Sigh...

20:02.097 --> 20:03.310
Do I have a job ?

20:03.420 --> 20:06.546
Okay, what the hell?

20:09.162 --> 20:10.342
>From the chechnyan?

20:15.930 --> 20:18.066
Smells like it's from the other guy.

20:18.322 --> 20:19.848
Gifts from an applicant?

20:21.978 --> 20:24.486
- The no-no of no-nos.
- I know.

20:24.733 --> 20:26.299
I'm counting on you, Millie.

20:26.340 --> 20:28.577
I hope you're at least narrowing it down.

20:28.775 --> 20:30.185
Uh, absolutely.

20:36.211 --> 20:37.727
Rock, paper, scissors...

20:38.001 --> 20:38.731
match.

20:38.904 --> 20:39.457
Fuck.

20:41.152 --> 20:44.124
Okay, what was the best thing about being a rock star?

20:44.300 --> 20:47.178
The same thing as the worst-- all the girls.

20:47.359 --> 20:50.328
Shut the fuck up. How was that possibly the worst?

20:50.517 --> 20:53.087
I had a family, and they left me.

20:54.875 --> 20:59.190
My wife got sick of my repeated indiscretions.

20:59.288 --> 21:00.178
I don't know, man.

21:00.235 --> 21:00.783
I mean,

21:00.956 --> 21:03.020
she...married a rock star.

21:03.165 --> 21:04.116
What did she expect?

21:04.392 --> 21:06.188
I always blamed the drugs.

21:06.625 --> 21:07.613
They made me feel...

21:09.625 --> 21:10.531
defiant...

21:12.953 --> 21:13.644
fearless...

21:15.892 --> 21:16.604
immortal.

21:20.043 --> 21:21.688
You are immortal. You made music.

21:22.839 --> 21:23.690
You live forever.

21:27.561 --> 21:28.580
I beg to differ.

21:30.874 --> 21:32.931
So embarrassing, but I...

21:34.012 --> 21:36.223
I wanted to be you so badly.

21:37.339 --> 21:37.949
I was...

21:40.300 --> 21:41.268
I was there.

21:42.516 --> 21:45.517
The church yard live, 1965, at Wembley.

21:45.665 --> 21:46.613
How old are you?

21:46.893 --> 21:47.595
I'm the same age...

21:49.249 --> 21:50.816
as I was then.

21:54.252 --> 21:55.695
I'm beginning to get this.

21:57.161 --> 21:58.797
You've just been hanging around for years,

21:59.632 --> 22:00.846
lurking in the corner.

22:01.875 --> 22:04.369
Yeah... immortal.

22:05.842 --> 22:07.789
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

22:07.862 --> 22:08.777
Good to know.

22:09.765 --> 22:12.332
So--so do you mind if I keep this one?

22:12.386 --> 22:13.202
No, I don't mind.

22:14.106 --> 22:15.142
Take anything you'd like.

22:16.841 --> 22:18.271
Just do me one good turn.

22:18.336 --> 22:19.207
Anything, man.

22:21.782 --> 22:22.951
Take the needle out...

22:23.390 --> 22:24.731
before the police arrive.

22:26.424 --> 22:28.413
I don't want them taking pictures of that.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.198
My kids might see it.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.649
I'm not meant to fuck around with anything,

22:34.700 --> 22:38.100
but for the man who invented the power stance, of course.

22:39.288 --> 22:40.486
You mean, like this?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.381
Nice.

23:02.967 --> 23:04.836
Forgive me, father, for I have sinned.

23:04.917 --> 23:08.119
It's been 75 years since my last confession.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.203
How is that possible?

23:11.169 --> 23:13.265
It feels like 75 years.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.726
What would you like to confess, my child?

23:17.485 --> 23:21.600
Petty larceny, and from a very unpleasant woman...

23:23.320 --> 23:26.100
so how many Hail Marys and our fathers is that?

23:27.698 --> 23:29.884
- What did you take?
- A necklace...

23:30.831 --> 23:32.152
with a cross on it.

23:33.647 --> 23:34.835
I needed it.

23:36.279 --> 23:39.233
And this person you took the cross from did not?

23:40.016 --> 23:40.692
No.

23:41.759 --> 23:42.490
Why not?

23:43.349 --> 23:44.301
She was dead.

23:46.611 --> 23:48.429
That is when we need it the most.

23:50.763 --> 23:54.987
Why don't we say ten Hail Marys and four our fathers,

23:55.224 --> 23:56.703
and we'll call it absolved.

23:58.356 --> 24:00.768
Wouldn't you rather talk about why you felt the need

24:00.824 --> 24:02.693
to steal a cross from a dead woman?

24:02.775 --> 24:05.140
No, I think the act speaks for itself.

24:07.450 --> 24:08.847
So how about my penance?

24:10.903 --> 24:11.986
What's your name?

24:12.311 --> 24:12.964
Daisy.

24:13.762 --> 24:14.936
Daisy Adair.

24:16.261 --> 24:19.247
Now, how about that penance?

24:19.692 --> 24:20.904
I can say the words,

24:21.575 --> 24:24.488
but it might be better if you tell me what's really on your mind.

24:29.266 --> 24:30.577
I'm waiting for something.

24:33.566 --> 24:36.650
I don't know. The cross makes me feel closer to it.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.506
Whether we're waiting for someone to say they love us,

24:39.961 --> 24:41.487
waiting for a check to clear,

24:42.419 --> 24:44.729
waiting for a man of the cloth to say we're forgiven,

24:45.726 --> 24:48.354
grace is passing by us every day,

24:48.589 --> 24:51.442
and we know not when the end of our days may be upon us.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.581
I know all about that, father.

24:55.230 --> 24:56.878
I just want my penance, please.

24:58.005 --> 24:58.994
Bless you, my child.

25:00.585 --> 25:02.383
Two Hail Marys and an act of contrition.

25:07.192 --> 25:08.091
I have to go.

25:12.172 --> 25:15.706
I was finding  that the best way to avoid taking responsibility...

25:21.710 --> 25:25.043
...was to avoid the person who gave you the responsibility.

25:26.294 --> 25:28.597
I'm so fucking smart, I scare myself.

25:32.125 --> 25:32.678
Oh.

25:33.350 --> 25:34.312
How did you do that?

25:35.331 --> 25:38.695
Do you have time to hear a message on my voice mail?

25:42.119 --> 25:43.420
Oh, that's just Murray.

25:43.456 --> 25:45.350
He learned speed dial. Such a good boy.

25:45.524 --> 25:46.411
How is Murray?

25:46.512 --> 25:48.986
Don't even think about changing the subject.

25:49.247 --> 25:49.984
He's okay.

25:51.811 --> 25:52.841
Delores, this is Ned.

25:53.456 --> 25:54.898
Where's my fucking temp, Delores?

25:54.965 --> 25:57.311
I'm sitting on a shit volcano here.

25:57.368 --> 25:59.881
I'm on top of mount saint shit, Delores!

26:00.414 --> 26:01.135
Help me.

26:02.754 --> 26:04.638
That is Ned Benjamin from Lunateca.

26:04.696 --> 26:05.529
He's your client.

26:05.636 --> 26:07.330
Your client is not happy.

26:07.423 --> 26:09.108
I'm working on it. I swear.

26:10.856 --> 26:12.385
What is it, Crystal?

26:12.467 --> 26:14.583
Package for Millie.  It's moving.

26:14.654 --> 26:16.686
- Why is it moving?
- It's alive.

26:19.018 --> 26:20.245
Oh...

26:28.256 --> 26:29.931
Oh, god.

26:30.730 --> 26:32.522
You have to make the decision, Millie.

26:32.557 --> 26:34.309
Don't let the decision make you.

26:35.548 --> 26:37.294
I don't even know what that means.

26:37.355 --> 26:38.687
Pick someone.

26:39.157 --> 26:40.274
Lose the rabbit.

26:41.652 --> 26:42.582
Hi, Millie.

26:44.201 --> 26:45.414
Hi, Michael.

26:45.491 --> 26:49.771
Hi. I was just hoping we could re-visit for a moment today's interview.

26:49.848 --> 26:52.343
Oh, please, god, I can't take another blast.

26:52.434 --> 26:55.911
Uh, you were great, Michael. You're definitely still in the mix.

26:55.977 --> 26:56.608
Cool.

26:56.883 --> 26:59.315
I just wanted you to let you know I'm not going to sue Happy Time

26:59.444 --> 27:00.627
if you don't choose me.

27:00.711 --> 27:03.350
Uh, I'm done blaming others for my problem.

27:03.969 --> 27:06.806
Well, that's very mature of you to say.

27:06.910 --> 27:09.280
- So are you going to choose me?
- I don't know. Maybe.

27:09.366 --> 27:13.205
Well, if it helps, I think you should know that I started new medication today,

27:13.283 --> 27:15.592
and it's been incredibly effective.

27:15.828 --> 27:17.149
Good for you.

27:21.055 --> 27:22.549
Wow, did you hear the rabbit fart?

27:24.873 --> 27:25.750
When's dinner?

27:26.118 --> 27:28.910
Whenever you want. You're having a babysitter tonight, okay?

27:31.796 --> 27:33.087
Till how late?

27:33.794 --> 27:36.697
Well, not late enough for you to watch Letterman, if that's what you're getting at.

27:36.999 --> 27:38.469
I don't want to watch Letterman.

27:38.858 --> 27:39.785
You can order pizza.

27:40.640 --> 27:43.036
- Do you have a date?
- No, I have an appointment.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.923
- Do I look like I have a date?
- No.

27:46.363 --> 27:48.007
- Do I look bad?
- No.

27:48.662 --> 27:50.511
- Can I have pepperoni?
- No.

27:55.164 --> 27:56.225
I'm leaving, Millie.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.552
I'm leaving without giving Ned Benjamin your decision.

27:59.624 --> 28:01.340
I just have to sleep on it.

28:01.415 --> 28:02.706
They needed someone today.

28:02.769 --> 28:04.714
It will all be clearer in the morning.

28:04.909 --> 28:06.864
Okay, Millie, you're in charge.

28:07.095 --> 28:10.288
I'm leaving. I've got my shows to watch.

28:10.832 --> 28:12.644
I didn't want to be in charge.

28:13.340 --> 28:16.158
I wanted to go home and stare at my TV.

28:16.976 --> 28:19.568
Being in charge was the loneliest feeling ever.

28:22.851 --> 28:24.564
All right, the second loneliest.

28:30.093 --> 28:31.517
I'm not going home.

28:32.117 --> 28:34.493
I'd just channel-surf all night anyway.

28:34.929 --> 28:36.699
Can't make a decision about anything.

28:40.878 --> 28:42.274
We have cable.

28:43.508 --> 28:44.866
Everybody has cable.

28:47.343 --> 28:49.934
We have pay stations, you know, with swearing.

28:50.871 --> 28:52.154
Wow, swearing.

28:53.021 --> 28:54.117
You're pretty tough, huh?

28:56.938 --> 28:58.024
My sister died.

29:00.635 --> 29:01.925
How did she die?

29:03.319 --> 29:04.331
Skydiving.

29:05.356 --> 29:07.854
My mom said we could order pizza, pepperoni.

29:08.320 --> 29:09.497
Whatever you want.

29:18.493 --> 29:19.497
Shit.

29:23.629 --> 29:24.832
Can you wait here for a second?

29:24.934 --> 29:26.697
I live here, so...yeah.

29:30.003 --> 29:31.315
What the fuck, Micah?

29:31.403 --> 29:33.399
Tommy said now. They're doing it now.

29:33.824 --> 29:37.495
I am going to beat his ass, I swear to fucking god.

29:39.828 --> 29:42.348
Hi. I've got to go for about an hour. You're cool, right?

29:43.695 --> 29:44.740
I'm cool.

29:47.950 --> 29:49.332
Don't tell your mom.

29:57.928 --> 30:01.466
This time of year, you could see Saturn's rings with the naked eye...

30:02.121 --> 30:03.869
if you've had enough to drink.

30:06.288 --> 30:08.609
Where's the music coming from?

30:08.865 --> 30:11.753
Ah...that's the brazilian club on 4th,

30:12.300 --> 30:15.230
and in the summertime, you can see chamber music on that rooftop.

30:16.908 --> 30:17.994
Oh... you play music?

30:19.151 --> 30:20.038
Piano.

30:20.539 --> 30:21.332
When I was a kid.

30:21.727 --> 30:22.321
You paint?

30:23.252 --> 30:23.781
I paint.

30:25.567 --> 30:26.473
Are you a writer?

30:27.702 --> 30:28.469
No.

30:29.314 --> 30:32.274
You seem like you could, like you have stories to tell.

30:32.986 --> 30:33.707
Maybe.

30:35.279 --> 30:36.595
You like the place, though, right?

30:37.968 --> 30:40.743
I do, but we're...

30:41.709 --> 30:43.861
I'm in escrow, so, you know,

30:44.199 --> 30:46.114
it's not a good time to want anything.

30:47.966 --> 30:49.887
Well, do you want a glass of wine?

31:00.578 --> 31:01.413
Hello?

31:11.921 --> 31:12.901
George?

31:14.596 --> 31:15.574
Is that you?

31:23.006 --> 31:27.970
You have very pretty features, very pretty and very sad.

31:30.019 --> 31:32.855
I need to get home to my daughter.

31:33.699 --> 31:36.371
She has a babysitter. She's safe.

31:36.791 --> 31:37.840
Why do you worry so much?

31:38.904 --> 31:42.382
Yeah, why worry, right?

31:44.891 --> 31:46.601
Two great girls...

31:48.148 --> 31:50.472
house in a nice neighborhood...

31:51.450 --> 31:52.408
the teacher...

31:54.682 --> 31:57.005
you make all the right choices...

31:59.816 --> 32:01.342
and things fall apart.

32:05.341 --> 32:07.686
"I made me great works, I builded me houses,

32:07.737 --> 32:10.404
"I planted me vineyards, and behold,

32:10.505 --> 32:12.606
"all was vanity and vexation of spirit."

32:13.374 --> 32:14.686
Ecclesiastes.

32:15.385 --> 32:16.115
Right.

32:17.435 --> 32:20.006
That's the one part of the bible I remember.

32:22.386 --> 32:24.224
It was about lists.

32:26.784 --> 32:29.611
I find lists very comforting.

32:31.971 --> 32:33.245
A time to live...

32:34.669 --> 32:35.868
a time to die.

32:37.276 --> 32:38.217
There it is.

32:39.748 --> 32:41.238
There's that sadness.

32:49.379 --> 32:50.782
I want this apartment.

32:53.455 --> 32:55.058
I want this life.

32:57.402 --> 32:59.512
Let me do one more, just one more.

33:01.059 --> 33:03.546
Fine, one more.

33:04.544 --> 33:05.784
Draw me happy.

33:34.942 --> 33:35.916
George?

33:46.151 --> 33:48.024
I'm making everyone unhappy.

33:48.075 --> 33:50.493
Everyone hates me, all of these people.

33:50.656 --> 33:53.457
Pharmaceutical Ned, you should've heard him on the phone today.

33:53.513 --> 33:54.977
He really hates me.

33:55.095 --> 33:57.378
Why on earth is this so hard for you?

33:57.440 --> 34:00.414
Because they all want it, and they all can handle it, but...

34:01.715 --> 34:02.884
who to choose?

34:03.575 --> 34:04.885
How to choose?

34:05.044 --> 34:06.375
You sound like Hamlet.

34:06.468 --> 34:08.065
What do you mean, I sound like Hamlet?

34:08.137 --> 34:09.409
All that indecision.

34:11.056 --> 34:13.099
I was Ophelia in Provincetown.

34:14.054 --> 34:15.329
Seems appropriate.

34:15.646 --> 34:17.561
Ophelia was the one who drowned, right?

34:17.985 --> 34:22.001
Yeah. Six nights a week and twice on sunday.

34:23.291 --> 34:24.699
That's Mason's knock.

34:30.453 --> 34:33.609
Okay. Allow me.

34:37.553 --> 34:41.487
Hey. Rube called. Group reap tomorrow.

34:42.291 --> 34:44.420
Dress code is business casual.

34:44.540 --> 34:45.717
You couldn't have called?

34:46.147 --> 34:49.230
- Oh, I wanted to play a record.
- What's wrong with your stereo?

34:49.295 --> 34:51.647
Well, the crack head I sold it to has it.

35:02.050 --> 35:03.818
What is that dreadful noise?

35:04.425 --> 35:08.245
It's...the memory of something that doesn't quite match a memory.

35:09.444 --> 35:11.892
- Are you drinking tonight?
- Sober as a priest.

35:13.924 --> 35:17.243
You know, Georgia, if you can't decide, give it up to god.

35:18.291 --> 35:19.745
Let him decide.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.870
I wouldn't let god decide, George.

35:32.388 --> 35:33.018
Why?

35:34.327 --> 35:35.662
Look how he fucked us.

35:40.396 --> 35:41.323
Oh, my god.

35:54.703 --> 35:56.369
Reggie, Reggie!

35:56.945 --> 35:57.585
Oh, god.

35:59.026 --> 36:01.556
What is it? What happened?

36:02.314 --> 36:04.326
Reggie, are you okay?

36:04.731 --> 36:07.992
I heard voices upstairs, like someone was in the house.

36:08.047 --> 36:09.497
Someone was in the house?

36:09.640 --> 36:11.462
Everything's fine, ma'am. No one was in the house.

36:11.622 --> 36:13.618
I think the little girl just got scared being alone.

36:15.708 --> 36:18.192
You told me, in an emergency, to call 911.

36:18.463 --> 36:20.648
Where is-- where's Janelle?

36:21.037 --> 36:22.482
She took off hours ago.

36:22.579 --> 36:24.202
I think she's a devil worshiper.

36:24.299 --> 36:26.414
She's going to Stanford next year.

36:26.722 --> 36:28.226
She couldn't get you on the cellphone.

36:28.467 --> 36:29.203
What?

36:30.888 --> 36:33.172
Oh, it's turned off.

36:34.253 --> 36:36.597
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

36:36.807 --> 36:37.776
We will need to contact

36:37.821 --> 36:39.004
child protection services.

36:39.352 --> 36:42.195
I--I will handle the babysitter myself.

36:42.317 --> 36:43.970
Actually, they'll be interviewing you.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.136
Every incident involving a minor requires it.

36:46.228 --> 36:48.354
Oh, please, what are you-- look at me.

36:48.455 --> 36:51.667
Do I look like somebody who would endanger a child?

36:51.850 --> 36:53.694
Have you had anything to drink this evening, ma'am?

36:54.196 --> 36:54.952
No...

36:55.555 --> 36:56.475
Of course not.

36:58.199 --> 36:58.967
Yeah.

37:00.796 --> 37:05.818
Well, okay, so thank you, officers, so much for responding.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.313
I really appreciate it.

37:07.554 --> 37:08.322
Good night.

37:08.618 --> 37:09.601
You have a good night, too.

37:18.597 --> 37:19.637
Where were you?

37:20.046 --> 37:21.706
I went to look at that apartment.

37:22.755 --> 37:23.590
It got late.

37:24.860 --> 37:25.801
I'm sorry.

37:28.532 --> 37:30.579
Linda wants you to call her in the morning.

37:31.173 --> 37:32.694
Did she say if it was about escrow?

37:32.986 --> 37:34.634
She just said to call her.

37:35.499 --> 37:36.806
All right.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.616
Well, it's time for bed, sweetie.

37:40.793 --> 37:42.023
Mom, I'm not tired.

37:43.328 --> 37:44.721
Do you want to sleep in my room tonight?

37:45.071 --> 37:45.785
Uh-huh.

37:48.232 --> 37:49.734
Where were the voices coming from?

37:51.387 --> 37:52.273
The roof.

37:53.927 --> 37:57.269
Well, the big tree sounds like voices when it's windy.

37:58.283 --> 38:00.716
Sometimes, I can't hear my own voice.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.808
I wish I could be like death.

38:04.484 --> 38:06.680
Death chooses without blinking an eye.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.144
Death doesn't gather information.

38:09.199 --> 38:10.755
Death doesn't ask questions.

38:11.159 --> 38:12.307
It just chooses.

38:21.421 --> 38:23.756
To jump or not to jump...

38:25.778 --> 38:26.771
We have a winner.

38:31.290 --> 38:32.219
Hello.

38:33.207 --> 38:34.734
- You call that "business casual"?
- Yeah.

38:34.799 --> 38:37.175
- Maybe in the drug business.
- I'm not in the drug business.

38:37.323 --> 38:39.165
What do you think of my outfit?

38:39.662 --> 38:40.863
It's very smart.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.811
It's very Rosalind Russell. That's a good thing.

38:44.359 --> 38:47.866
Can I get a half-caff with foam, cream, and extra sugar to go?

38:48.523 --> 38:49.520
Let's get reaping.

38:49.561 --> 38:50.538
What've we got, Rube?

38:50.631 --> 38:53.493
Well, people, this is a group job. We've got one address, 13 souls.

38:53.539 --> 38:54.901
I've got three a piecefor the ladies,

38:55.188 --> 38:56.863
I've got two for Mason, two for me.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.987
I've got a pair of men's slacks in the car for you.

38:59.095 --> 39:00.759
- I don't wear slacks.
- You will this morning.

39:04.194 --> 39:06.704
You, you, you, you.

39:07.282 --> 39:09.279
- I do not smoke.
- You will this morning.

39:09.340 --> 39:10.103
It's our cover.

39:10.174 --> 39:11.818
We're just going to stand outside the building and smoke.

39:11.864 --> 39:13.368
I would love to see some inhaling, people,

39:13.405 --> 39:15.919
and I would love if you tried to make it look real.

39:16.058 --> 39:17.316
Well, let's get cracking.

39:17.383 --> 39:19.734
- Who wants a ride?
- I want a ride. Shotgun.

39:20.518 --> 39:23.087
Rube, these slacks you've brought me are horrible, aren't they?

39:23.251 --> 39:25.403
No, no, no, they're not horrible, and I always ride shotgun.

39:28.064 --> 39:29.462
How much will that cost?

39:30.577 --> 39:32.416
Oh...okay.

39:33.752 --> 39:37.137
Well, will they revisit it if we get the roof fixed?

39:38.964 --> 39:39.717
Okay.

39:40.448 --> 39:41.310
Thanks, Linda.

39:44.617 --> 39:45.396
What did she say?

39:46.731 --> 39:47.541
It's done.

39:49.103 --> 39:50.561
We sold the house? We have to leave?

39:51.812 --> 39:52.861
We have to stay.

39:54.412 --> 39:55.706
The deal fell through.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.059
It's the roof.

39:57.719 --> 39:59.348
There's some kind of crack up there...

40:01.115 --> 40:03.284
a very expensive crack.

40:03.598 --> 40:05.118
I told you I heard voices.

40:07.656 --> 40:10.637
Who's going to give us the money to fix it, Reggie?

40:11.099 --> 40:11.717
Dad?

40:13.345 --> 40:14.031
Hardly.

40:15.425 --> 40:16.630
Grandma Phyl could.

40:17.838 --> 40:19.479
I'm not going to ask my mother.

40:25.413 --> 40:26.365
I miss her.

40:28.094 --> 40:29.392
You miss your grandmother?

40:30.999 --> 40:32.965
I miss... her.

40:38.418 --> 40:40.036
We shouldn't move.

40:42.048 --> 40:43.263
We'll see.

40:44.691 --> 40:45.935
If we moved...

40:46.667 --> 40:48.259
she wouldn't know where to find us.

40:55.325 --> 40:56.211
Separate groups--

40:57.127 --> 40:58.516
let's not look like some kind of lineup.

40:59.898 --> 41:01.074
Keep your cover.

41:08.114 --> 41:10.162
Pardon me, handsome, do you have...

41:11.049 --> 41:11.858
do you have a light?

41:12.409 --> 41:13.863
- I'll get you one.
- Thanks.

41:20.626 --> 41:21.545
Timing...

41:22.113 --> 41:23.700
Daisy had it in spades.

41:24.422 --> 41:27.597
She didn't stop  to wonder why one guy got it and not another.

41:28.334 --> 41:31.016
It was his time. That's all.

41:56.482 --> 41:58.757
It is me, Anton Plotnick.

41:59.433 --> 42:00.450
You're here to greet me.

42:00.624 --> 42:01.138
I am?

42:01.204 --> 42:04.281
In my culture, a man does not easily express his feelings,

42:04.952 --> 42:07.103
but I am grateful to start new life.

42:07.727 --> 42:08.372
Thank you.

42:15.592 --> 42:18.188
Time for work. Goodbye.

42:27.003 --> 42:27.963
Are you okay, George?

42:31.086 --> 42:31.745
No.

42:32.048 --> 42:34.234
Shit volcano, that's all it is.

42:34.275 --> 42:36.332
I'm just on top of a shit volcano.

42:36.395 --> 42:37.612
I think we have our shooter.

42:37.729 --> 42:39.360
I'm just on top of a shit volcano.

42:40.086 --> 42:41.182
Ned Benjamin?

42:41.581 --> 42:43.158
- What's it to you?
- Nothing.

42:46.768 --> 42:47.818
Don't touch my bag!

42:56.186 --> 42:58.765
Roxy nailed it-- rampage.

42:59.487 --> 43:00.486
What can I say?

43:01.786 --> 43:02.810
What's wrong, George?

43:03.593 --> 43:04.391
I'm good.

43:10.045 --> 43:11.145
That was horrible.

43:18.594 --> 43:19.688
Now?

43:22.007 --> 43:23.699
That was Ned Benjamin.

43:26.008 --> 43:28.369
I actually read Hamlet in high school.

43:28.820 --> 43:30.580
The guy can't make a decision,

43:30.820 --> 43:32.571
and everybody dies.

43:36.340 --> 43:37.467
I am Hamlet,

43:37.949 --> 43:39.612
and everybody dies.

43:39.812 --> 43:42.418
Millie, I want to show you something.

43:42.517 --> 43:44.154
Can I put my bag down first?

43:44.211 --> 43:45.454
I had a really rough morning.

43:45.516 --> 43:47.843
Oh, I think you'll agree this is worth it.

43:52.868 --> 43:53.642
What is it?

43:53.713 --> 43:56.094
Job placements, all over the city.

43:56.155 --> 43:58.582
Just look at all those lovely little stickpins.

43:58.803 --> 43:59.981
See the effect we have?

44:00.237 --> 44:04.484
We're like... Johnny Appleseeds, planting, thriving...

44:04.782 --> 44:08.637
It's really cool, Delores. Thank you.

44:09.233 --> 44:13.251
Do you know I have been calling over to Lunateca all morning, and there's no answer?

44:13.308 --> 44:17.003
It's rush, rush, rush when they need you, and then it's, "uh, Happy Time who?"

44:17.435 --> 44:22.223
Listen, Delores, as much as I'm flattered by the new responsibilities...

44:23.175 --> 44:25.878
I don't think I'm up to the task of...

44:26.344 --> 44:27.910
placing people.

44:27.998 --> 44:31.709
Nonsense, you did fine. You just need to jump in.

44:31.781 --> 44:34.230
I don't feel qualified to choose.

44:37.888 --> 44:39.375
This is Delores.

44:46.494 --> 44:47.613
Oh, my lord.

44:50.424 --> 44:52.339
To everything, there is a season,

44:53.116 --> 44:54.049
a time to stay,

44:54.966 --> 44:56.778
and a time to get the hell out...

44:57.247 --> 44:58.871
Oh, those poor people.

45:06.998 --> 45:09.220
And for now, it's still hockey season.

45:10.177 --> 45:13.778
It seems to me you can either have someone tell you what to do with your life,

45:14.078 --> 45:16.321
or you can look somewhere else for answers.

45:22.354 --> 45:25.471
It's like you have to figure out where your gut is and then go with it.

45:27.530 --> 45:31.456
Sure beats standing around the punch bowl with the rest of the losers.

45:35.444 --> 45:37.151
He shoots, he scores.

45:40.094 --> 45:41.307
Hey. I'm George.

45:42.062 --> 45:42.895
I'm Andy.

45:42.996 --> 45:47.706
Seems to me either you show up at the dance or you just stay home...

45:48.306 --> 45:51.097
One-two-three, one-two-three...
