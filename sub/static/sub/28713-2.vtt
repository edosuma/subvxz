<i>If you're watching this...</i>

00:09.968 --> 00:11.504
<i>it means I probably didn't make it.</i>

00:13.347 --> 00:15.213
<i>Sarah, Wendell, Charlie.</i>

00:16.767 --> 00:18.554
<i>It's on to you to do what I couldn't.</i>

00:20.771 --> 00:21.887

01:37.806 --> 01:39.217
Hey, kitty.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.487
Can we just...

01:54.573 --> 01:55.939
take a breath, Daniel?

01:57.492 --> 01:59.028
I'm aware I have a distinctive timbre.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.119
Hearing it now, seeing my face,
removing all doubt,

02:01.204 --> 02:02.445
you may be inclined to...

02:03.290 --> 02:05.782
instantly pull the trigger,
perhaps involuntarily.

02:05.876 --> 02:09.164
A Pavlovian response
of self-defence, so...

02:09.963 --> 02:10.963
can we just...

02:12.132 --> 02:14.124
take a breath before we begin?

02:15.427 --> 02:18.420
You still talk too much, Victor.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.182
Turn around.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.473
Slowly.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.687
I'm unarmed.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.111
Skidmark likes you.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.862
He has good taste.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.234
He licks his own ass.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.030
- You knew I was here?
- Yes.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.785
Then why are <i>you</i> here?

02:44.247 --> 02:47.831
I understand that we parted
under difficult circumstances,

02:47.918 --> 02:48.954
but things have changed.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.044
I'm a...

02:53.840 --> 02:55.797
Sometimes they don't trip.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.508
- Yeah.
- Come inside.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.135
It's not safe to talk out here.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.687
Skidmark! Skidmark! Get in there!

03:43.432 --> 03:44.432
Oh.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.808
Well, whatever it was
she came to check out...

03:56.570 --> 03:58.812
- it's gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?

03:58.905 --> 04:03.275
<i>- You said she pinned it to the ground.</i>
- Well, the rain turned the ground to mush.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.404
Must've slipped free.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.370
I don't know.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.871
Maybe she followed it.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.540
Maybe she's just chasing the story,
like she does, you know.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.086
You really believe that?

04:15.839 --> 04:18.047
<i>I mean, with everything we've seen
since the crash.</i>

04:18.132 --> 04:21.250
I guess I want to.
But if I'm being honest...

04:22.804 --> 04:24.511
No. No, I don't.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.136
John, Alicia, over here.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.851
So whoever took Al
took all the weapons and the ammo.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.683
I saw what you packed in there, too.
You were ready for D-Day.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.484
There's a road back there.

04:38.570 --> 04:41.938
If somebody took her, took all of this,
probably had a vehicle.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.989
- Okay, so we'll check it out.
- All right.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.262
Grab whatever's worth keeping
and take it back to the truck.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.286
All right.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.827
Walkie if you get into trouble.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.871
But be careful.
We don't know who's listening.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.912
I should've stopped her.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.795
Hey. We're not gonna go to regrets
just yet. We can't.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.248
It's Al. I should've known.

05:04.513 --> 05:05.513
I got it.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.054
- Let me help.
- No, it's fine.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.785
Okay, you know what?
Here's your next dose.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.377
All right. That'll help take the edge off.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.683
- I can't feel my fingers.
- Yeah, that's normal.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.432
The bar, it was close
to the brachial plexus.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.102
It's gonna take a while for this to heal.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.444
When will I be able to play the accordion?

06:04.447 --> 06:05.904
You play the accordion?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.533
I was thinking of learning.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.988
Yeah, you need to rest.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.916
You push it, you're gonna need
something a lot stronger than this.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.789
- Anything?
- No sign of Al.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.844
I scavenged what I could.
Some bits of food. First-aid supplies.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.555
And I found these.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.849
Wow.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.391
Thought Polar Bear
might have a route or two in there.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.562
I also found this out there.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.899
Figure any book that can survive
a hurricane and a plane crash

06:41.985 --> 06:44.773
with just a few singed pages
might be worth hanging on to.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.855
- Thank you, John.
- Sure.

06:47.991 --> 06:51.109
Morgan and Alicia... headed north,

06:51.202 --> 06:54.536
see what they could see. I figured
we'll just head the opposite direction.

06:54.623 --> 06:55.739
I can't leave her alone.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.410
I won't be alone.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.791
Only need one hand to operate the radio.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.336
- It's not like I'm playing the accordion.
- No.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.466
- This is the drugs talking, right?
- Yeah.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.713
Oh.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.523
Well, we're running short on weapons,
but...

07:11.348 --> 07:13.681
If you run into trouble,
this should take care of it.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.763
I'll try and reach Strand on the CB.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.812
- See if he heard Al's message.
- Okay.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.612
Follow me.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.069
Don't touch anything.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.950
So, where did you get
this veritable bounty from?

07:41.044 --> 07:43.707
- You can say I inherit it.
- From whom?

07:43.797 --> 07:47.586
Victor, you're in no position
to be asking questions. I have a few.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.335
What are you doing here? What do you want?

07:50.428 --> 07:52.841
Well, I was told
you may have a small plane.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.677
Who told you that?

07:57.394 --> 07:58.394
Althea.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.186
The journalist?

08:02.273 --> 08:04.890
- You know her?
- How do you think I found you?

08:04.985 --> 08:06.226
A small world.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.811
Well, therefore,

08:08.905 --> 08:12.194
we have an ineluctable responsibility
to those who remain.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.368
Hey. You know them, Daniel.

08:16.871 --> 08:17.871
Madison?

08:20.083 --> 08:21.083
Well...

08:23.294 --> 08:24.535
She's gone.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.551
Nick too.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.419
But Alicia, she remains.

08:35.140 --> 08:39.259
And your plane. I need it to help her.
To help Al. To help all our friends.

08:40.729 --> 08:41.890
Why can't you be honest?

08:42.731 --> 08:44.097
It's for you.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.558
It's for you and no one else.
I know who you are.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.360
You don't have to believe me.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.315
Do you have a long-range radio
amongst this treasure trove?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.276
Please.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.781
Luciana, 31 North is blocked.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.794
- Got more of those radiation signs.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

09:07.505 --> 09:09.087
<i>Heard anything from Strand?</i>

09:09.674 --> 09:12.337
Not yet, but I'll let you know
when he makes contact.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.840
- Because he will.
- What makes you so sure?

09:14.929 --> 09:16.045
I just know.

09:16.139 --> 09:19.507
And it's not from the drugs.
The accordion stuff is from the drugs.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.351
The what?

09:23.521 --> 09:24.521
Never mind.

09:24.606 --> 09:25.606
Copy that.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.652
- If Al's in there...
- She will come through this.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.822
- We don't even know what this is.
- Alicia.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.700
This isn't all on you.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.763
Yes, it is. That's what we decided
at the River Mill.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.279
I'd keep everyone safe.
You'd handle the rest.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.954
Yeah, we didn't decide that, you did.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.577
But we all got on the plane.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.421
We all came here.

09:50.799 --> 09:53.416
And we'd all do
whatever it takes to find Al.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.096
Yeah.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.742
It's warm.

11:54.881 --> 11:55.997
Take off your clothes.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.175
All of them.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.798
I know how this looks,
but I don't want to shoot you.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.383
So just do as I say. Please.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.264
- I don't understand.
- Don't talk.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.846
Talking's bad. Breathing's bad.
At least right now.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.775
Cut yourself loose
and slowly back away from the body.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.815
Toss the ropes on to the tarp,

12:18.905 --> 12:21.318
and remember,
breathe as little as possible.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.905
I'm gonna need to get that back.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.993
It's kind of important to me.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.625
Well, shit.
You're really a talker, aren't you?

12:36.714 --> 12:40.708
Remember what I said about talking?
I don't want to have to do it this way!

12:44.013 --> 12:45.220
Drop it.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.557
Where is she?

12:49.185 --> 12:50.551
- Where is she?
- Who?

12:50.645 --> 12:52.261
- Our friend.
- Hey, Alicia...

12:52.355 --> 12:54.938
Al went back to the plane
because she saw someone wearing a mask.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.775
Where is she?

12:56.859 --> 12:59.772
I don't know. But let me keep you
from losing another friend.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.816
Alicia.

13:10.373 --> 13:11.373
Why?

13:13.876 --> 13:17.586
There are two pressurised water reactors
13 miles north of here.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.917
The cooling system failed in one.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.002
Reactor melted down last year,

13:22.719 --> 13:25.039
killing a lot of people
who were trying to keep it humming.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.255
Including that corpse.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.402
Which means his body's carrying
some particularly dangerous particles.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.455
Some of them may have gotten on to...
What's your name?

13:33.479 --> 13:34.595
Morgan.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.806
Some of them
may have gotten on to Morgan.

13:36.899 --> 13:40.518
- He needs to be decontaminated.
- Exactly how do we do that?

13:40.611 --> 13:42.773
I can show you. Back in my truck.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.026
She could be lying.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.783
- What's your name?
- Grace.

13:48.870 --> 13:49.870
Grace.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.205
- You telling us the truth?
- Yes.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.451
Let's let her go.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.258
I'm holding on to this.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.934
I'm still gonna need you
to take your clothes off.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.568
Scrub yourself down. Not too hard.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.577
Careful of those scratches.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.239
Make sure you clean under your nails.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.950
- Oh, and your wedding ring.
- What about it?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.286
Take it off. Clean under it.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.339
Once you're done with all that,
keep the water running.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.511
Lift your right foot, rinse it,
place it on the ground.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.759
Then do the same thing with the left.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.849
Clothes are over there.
Sorry about the selection.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.018
Laundry day's next week.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.043
He should be okay.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.463
- Can I have my gun back?
- I'm gonna hang on to it.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.254
What happened to your friend?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.336
We don't know.
She went missing last night.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.346
I can help you look.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.840
As soon as I take care of him.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.344
Thanks.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.149
What are those?

15:48.656 --> 15:51.990
Dosimeters.
They measure exposure to radiation.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.118
See them on the dead, run the other way.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.823
Is it even safe to be here?

16:01.002 --> 16:02.959
As long as you stay on this side
of the signs.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.441
What about the dead tied across the road?
Are you trying to scare people off?

16:05.465 --> 16:06.922
That definitely was not me.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.424
I run away from those things.
You should too.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.484
That was your plane
that crashed yesterday.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.051
- Bet that drew a lot of the dead.
- We handled it.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.437
- How many did you kill?
- I don't really count.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.480
I'm gonna need you
to take me to the crash site.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.103
We don't have time for that.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.193
You could be contaminated.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.028
So could your friend.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.199
<i>Anybody copy?
We've had a bit of a hiccup.</i>

16:34.285 --> 16:36.993
Our truck gave out on us.
We're gonna have to hoof it from here.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.781
<i>John, be careful when killing the dead.
They could be contaminated.</i>

16:40.875 --> 16:43.709
- Contaminated with what?
<i>- Radiation.</i>

16:43.794 --> 16:47.083
<i>The signs were real.
Turns out a reactor melted down nearby.</i>

16:47.173 --> 16:48.173
So we can't kill them?

16:48.257 --> 16:51.591
Not if they have...
dosimeters on their necks.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.545
They're like small round cylinders.
Look like pens.

16:54.639 --> 16:55.925
Copy that.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.699
This place just keeps getting
friendlier and friendlier, don't it?

17:01.062 --> 17:02.928
That's exactly why we need to be here.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.685
Little bit of sunshine in a dark place.

17:06.817 --> 17:07.817
Maybe so.

17:08.736 --> 17:09.736
Looky here.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.611
That was on the van the kids were driving.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.819
- If that's where they're from...
- Maybe they went back.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.181
Hmm.

17:48.651 --> 17:49.651
Max?

17:50.778 --> 17:51.778
Dylan?

17:53.030 --> 17:54.237
Annie?

17:54.323 --> 17:56.923
- They didn't want to be found yesterday.
- They want to be found.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.260
They sure got a funny way of showing it.

18:00.871 --> 18:04.285
When I ran, I'd wake up every morning
hoping it'd be the day that you'd find me.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.541
Then why did you keep running?

18:10.298 --> 18:12.460
Part of me was scared
that you'd stopped looking...

18:13.342 --> 18:14.342
you'd given up.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.340
It's easier to keep moving than to...

18:18.431 --> 18:20.764
face the possibility
that you weren't out there.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.736
I don't know if the kids are here,
but someone sure called this place home.

18:37.825 --> 18:38.825
Yeah.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.121
They fought for it.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.792
They might have just won, too.
That fence has been repaired.

18:53.424 --> 18:54.424
You hear that?

19:38.594 --> 19:39.594
Alicia?

19:40.429 --> 19:41.429
Al?

19:41.931 --> 19:43.217
Do you copy?

19:43.307 --> 19:44.514
Morgan?

19:45.101 --> 19:46.262
John?

19:46.352 --> 19:47.352
Luciana?

19:50.815 --> 19:53.775
Signal's not strong enough. They crashed
on the other side of the mountain.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.977
Why weren't you on that plane, Victor?

19:57.071 --> 19:59.007
The dead flooded the runway.
Someone had to clear them.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.149
And that unselfish heroic someone
had to be you.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.740
I did it to help my friends.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.243
The last time I heard you say that,
a dam exploded

20:08.332 --> 20:10.745
and someone shot me in the face.

20:13.129 --> 20:16.213
I'm so sorry, Daniel.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.258
I'm not the same man that I was in Mexico.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.175
You do have a new haircut.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.890
You don't think a man can change?

20:32.565 --> 20:33.806
Some men.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.611
I know I've done things.

20:40.698 --> 20:41.698
Terrible things.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.988
Things that I might not be able
to make up for, but...

20:47.997 --> 20:49.033
I'm trying.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.408
I hope you can believe that.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.956
Let me do that.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.380
You're missing half the upper bands.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.680
These are clean.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.612
I got this.

21:25.826 --> 21:26.826
Hey.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.158
Hey, so about my stick.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.741
Am I ever gonna get that back?

21:33.834 --> 21:37.293
You can't. The wood is porous.
There's no way of cleaning it.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.457
It's not about it being just pointy, huh?

21:43.886 --> 21:46.879
- These are all clean.
- Great. Let's keep moving.

21:47.348 --> 21:48.348
Wait.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.391
You knocked down my fence.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.310
I don't have any bird traps over here.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.309
That was the only thing keeping them
from crossing the eastern border.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.275
We need to search the area,
put up more fencing.

22:00.361 --> 22:03.854
Okay, we need to find our friend.
We're wasting time chasing the dead.

22:03.948 --> 22:07.316
- Is that what you think this is?
- Al's still alive. They're not.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.366
That's one of mine.
Give me my gun.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.167
I told you, I'm hanging on to it.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.462
Alicia, let her do what she does.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.280
Get your gear, you help her,
I'll take care of the rest of them.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.303
- It's not safe!
- I'll do it safe.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.932
You wanna risk going terminal
to get your killing in?

22:32.685 --> 22:33.892
We don't have time for this.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.271
Let's go.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.809
We'll get the tarp. Come on.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.605
Back of the truck.
Help me with my suit.

22:46.407 --> 22:47.989
- Grab the tape.
- Okay.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.169
Shit.

23:08.554 --> 23:11.262
- I can't tell which one's which.
- Get away from them!

23:15.644 --> 23:17.351
Water tank's empty. We gotta move.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.241
Get the tarp!

23:40.419 --> 23:43.127
- It's got to be one of these.
- Step back.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.788
Throw me my gun.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.921
Come on.

23:53.015 --> 23:54.802
This one's clear.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.634
Alicia, hang on!

23:57.728 --> 24:00.266
- One more.
- Hurry!

24:06.070 --> 24:07.732
This is our guy.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.517
You could've been exposed,

24:43.607 --> 24:45.564
and I don't have any more water
in my tank.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.392
I couldn't have decontaminated you.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.399
I know you want to find your friend...

24:51.824 --> 24:53.907
but she wouldn't want you
to get sick and die either.

25:15.723 --> 25:17.885
Help me with the body?

25:17.975 --> 25:19.182
Yeah.

25:25.691 --> 25:26.691
You knew them.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.317
I worked at the plant. Ran operations.

25:33.991 --> 25:35.402
Once things started going south,

25:35.492 --> 25:37.779
I called in all the shifts
to help keep the place running.

25:38.579 --> 25:41.037
Once things got worse,
I called in their families.

25:41.623 --> 25:44.491
We had food, supplies, fuel
to last for months.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.334
The place was designed
to keep terrorists out,

25:47.838 --> 25:49.124
so the dead weren't a problem.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.133
I was.

25:53.260 --> 25:56.594
Once the cities fell,
they didn't need the power we were making.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.396
I just couldn't see that things
weren't going back to the way they were.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.933
I should've evacuated the plant.

26:03.854 --> 26:06.166
We didn't have the infrastructure
to keep the place going the right way.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.022
So how many of them
are still left out there?

26:10.986 --> 26:12.227
Sixty-three.

26:14.573 --> 26:18.283
I couldn't take care of them then.
So I have to take care of them now.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.116
<i>Anybody copy?
Repeat, anybody copy?</i>

26:26.210 --> 26:27.371
We copy. You all right?

26:28.003 --> 26:29.003
We are.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.830
You know those cylinders
you told us to watch out for?

26:32.674 --> 26:34.836
We just might've found
a whole bunch of them.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.504
Don't touch anything.
We're on our way.

27:05.207 --> 27:06.618
Did you touch anything?

27:06.708 --> 27:09.268
- Did you breathe any of that ash?
- No, ma'am, we stayed upwind.

27:09.336 --> 27:12.829
- Burning them doesn't kill the radiation?
- Just releases it into the air.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.417
Who did this? They could be very sick.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.006
They're not sick.

27:35.445 --> 27:36.589
You don't have to do this
to yourse...

27:36.613 --> 27:37.613
Don't.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.739
They could be contaminated, too.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.242
This is why finding the dead matters.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.325
This is why no one else can kill them.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.165
Those people were exposed.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.474
They thought
they were protecting themselves.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.360
Strand?

28:18.030 --> 28:19.441
Do you copy?

28:25.412 --> 28:27.825
Strand, are you there?

28:32.252 --> 28:35.541
<i>- Luciana.</i>
- Strand! I'm here!

28:36.798 --> 28:38.710
- Where are you?
<i>- At the truck stop.</i>

28:39.259 --> 28:43.378
I got hurt really bad in the crash.
June had to operate. I'll recover.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.839
<i>I don't think myjacket will.</i>

28:46.475 --> 28:48.467
- And the others?
<i>- Al is missing.</i>

28:48.560 --> 28:50.301
<i>We can't find her.</i>

28:50.395 --> 28:53.388
<i>We found some other people.
We're trying to help them.</i>

28:53.482 --> 28:54.689
But this place...

28:56.902 --> 28:59.019
We can't stay here for long.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.354
<i>You won't have to.
I got Al's message.</i>

29:01.448 --> 29:03.064
<i>The man with the plane?</i>

29:03.158 --> 29:04.615
<i>I found him.</i>

29:04.701 --> 29:07.910
And, Luciana, I know him.
Alicia knows him.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.578
<i>He's gonna help us.</i>

29:13.460 --> 29:14.746
Luciana?

29:15.921 --> 29:17.833
Luciana, do you copy?

29:20.300 --> 29:21.632
Strand?

29:21.718 --> 29:22.799
Are you there?

29:33.397 --> 29:34.397
Luciana?

29:36.566 --> 29:37.682
Luciana, do you copy?

29:40.529 --> 29:42.111
Do you believe me now?

29:43.532 --> 29:46.115
They need help.
It's worse than I thought.

29:46.952 --> 29:47.952
Yes, they do.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.121
Follow me.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.392
Someone there?

30:45.594 --> 30:46.880
This one has keys.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.973
And three-quarters of a tank.

30:57.814 --> 31:00.147
It's got a lot of seats. Room for us all.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.524
- Kids too.
- Yeah.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.112
<i>It's Luciana. Is anybody there?</i>

31:06.198 --> 31:07.359
Yeah, we copy.

31:07.449 --> 31:10.658
Strand got Al's message.
He's getting the plane right now.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.070
Luciana, you talked to him?

31:14.748 --> 31:17.206
Not for long. The wind.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.700
It took out the long-range antenna.

31:20.462 --> 31:23.079
Are you outside right now?
You shouldn't be on your feet.

31:23.173 --> 31:24.880
It's fine. I'm feeling much better.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.128
<i>Luciana, get back inside.
Lock the doors.</i>

31:27.219 --> 31:29.461
<i>We're heading back to you now.</i>

32:57.642 --> 32:58.642
You okay?

33:07.319 --> 33:08.605
She was right.

33:11.031 --> 33:13.739
Those people didn't know
what they were doing, and I did.

33:16.161 --> 33:19.450
And it's not because I didn't believe her.
I did. I just still did it anyway.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.549
I used to think that killing
was the only thing that I could do.

33:38.475 --> 33:40.683
It <i>is</i> the only thing I can do.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.855
I haven't helped anyone.

33:52.197 --> 33:56.282
I haven't found anyone on those tapes.
I couldn't stop Al from going missing.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.492
Every walker I kill,
that's one less dangerous thing out there.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.948
Yeah, it used to be like that for me.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.214
But, um...

34:12.801 --> 34:15.464
It was worse. I was lost. I was stuck.

34:17.304 --> 34:18.304
I didn't know it.

34:19.808 --> 34:22.846
You don't know it
until somebody tells you, so, uh...

34:28.608 --> 34:30.224
I gotta tell you.

34:33.530 --> 34:36.318
I'm really sorry
I didn't say this before...

34:37.242 --> 34:40.656
but these things haven't always gone
the way that I would hope.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.452
You are not locked in.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.289
A door opens. There is a way out.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.170
A way out to what?

34:54.592 --> 34:56.380
Well, there isn't any safety.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.091
There's no way to really protect yourself.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.719
You can't put a weapon
between you and losing people,

35:02.809 --> 35:05.142
and you can't even run away
from them either.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.638
And I'm telling you that because I tried.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.605
The way out is opening the door.

35:15.989 --> 35:17.070
To people.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.107
To possibility.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.323
To the hurt that will happen.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.084
Well, that's what I did.

35:32.213 --> 35:36.674
I found the way, and I opened the door,
and then my life started all over again.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.837
Yours will too.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.068
Hey, where you going?

35:55.195 --> 35:57.152
There's some caverns near the plant.

35:58.365 --> 36:01.108
I bury the bodies there
so this kind of thing doesn't happen.

36:01.701 --> 36:04.114
And you've really gotta take my stick.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.080
Yeah.

36:07.666 --> 36:11.205
You shouldn't stay here long.
This whole place needs to be cleaned.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.209
- You don't have to do this alone.
- You can't help me.

36:15.298 --> 36:16.298
We can.

36:16.383 --> 36:19.626
You said there are 63 left.
We just found half of them in the ashes.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.927
We could help you find the rest.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.472
And then once we find Al, those kids,
maybe you can come back with us.

36:25.558 --> 36:28.266
- We got a plane coming.
- I can't go back with you.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.810
The people who died, you tried...

36:31.022 --> 36:33.730
you tried to stop something like this
from happening to them.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.854
This isn't about whether I deserve it.

36:38.071 --> 36:41.189
After the accident,
I went back into the plant,

36:41.282 --> 36:43.695
for days, looking for survivors.

36:45.495 --> 36:48.954
I was careful, but I was still exposed
to more alpha emitters

36:49.040 --> 36:50.576
than most people see in a lifetime.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.663
I'm not risking anyone else's well-being.

36:54.421 --> 36:55.421
I'm not doing that.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.672
How long do you have?

37:03.346 --> 37:04.882
I don't know.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.306
What you're doing for your people,
we would like to help.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.975
So, if you change your mind...
and I think you should...

37:10.061 --> 37:12.348
we'll be on the other end
of that walkie, Channel 7.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.482
I hope you find your friend.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.935
See any of my friends...

37:20.697 --> 37:23.110
I'm on the other side of this walkie too.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.785
You said this was gonna be hard.

37:36.796 --> 37:37.796
Yeah.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.507
Yeah, I did.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.971
Luci? Luciana?

37:56.065 --> 37:57.727
Luci!

37:59.235 --> 38:00.316
Are you all right?

38:00.403 --> 38:02.269
- Where are they?
- Who?

38:04.532 --> 38:05.532
The dead.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.281
Somebody knows we're here.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.117
They're trying to scare us.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.413
I don't know what I'm seeing.

38:16.503 --> 38:17.994
You know what I'm seeing?

38:18.087 --> 38:20.329
Whole lotta effort
when they could've just left a note?

38:21.257 --> 38:24.500
This, the roadblocks.
Means we're getting close to something.

38:24.969 --> 38:27.006
Strand's gonna get here with that plane.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.896
We're gonna find Al, we're gonna find
those kids, we're gonna get home.

38:41.194 --> 38:45.108
- Where do you keep the plane?
- It's time for you to leave, Victor.

38:48.117 --> 38:50.109
Hey. I don't understand.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.320
- Our friends need help.
- Yes, they do.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.575
But not from you.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.867
What the hell are you talking about?
You heard Luciana!

38:57.961 --> 39:00.578
You told me the reason
you were not on that plane

39:00.672 --> 39:02.789
was because you wanted
to help your friends.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.839
Doesn't look like it worked out that way.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.792
Daniel! Please!

39:06.886 --> 39:11.597
Alicia is resourceful like her mother.
Althea is a survivor. They'll manage.

39:13.351 --> 39:17.265
I'm not giving you the plane,
'cause you'll make it all worse for them.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.098
Every time you help people,
you end up hurting them.

39:20.942 --> 39:22.854
No one knows that better than I do.

39:35.540 --> 39:39.204
And if you come back,
the next one will be in your face.
