00:07.208 --> 00:09.177
- IN THE CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:09.210 --> 00:12.546
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.149
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:15.183 --> 00:17.251
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:17.285 --> 00:18.686
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:18.719 --> 00:20.588
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.656
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.826
- BENSON--
- OLIVIA, HANK VOIGHT.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.595
- HEY.
ARE YOUR PEOPLE ON THE WAY?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.063
- YEAH.

00:29.097 --> 00:31.132
- OKAY, I SENT THE PHOTOS
THAT YOUR PEOPLE FOUND

00:31.165 --> 00:34.202
TO OUR CONTACT AT
MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.270
HE'S FOUND A LINK BETWEEN
THOSE IMAGES AND A VIDEO RING

00:36.304 --> 00:39.207
THAT'S BEEN SEX TRAFFICKING KIDS
FOR OVER A DECADE.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.242
- A DECADE?
HOW'S THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

00:41.275 --> 00:43.177
- AS SOON AS LINDSAY
AND HALSTEAD ARRIVE

00:43.211 --> 00:45.546
I'LL BRIEF 'EM.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.382
- LISTEN, JUST SO YOU KNOW--
FOR DETECTIVE LINDSAY,

00:48.416 --> 00:50.518
THIS IS
A PERSONAL SITUATION.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.354
ONE OF THE VICS IN THE PHOTOS
IS HER HALF BROTHER.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.556
- I HEARD. I'LL--I'LL--
I'LL KEEP MY EYE ON HER.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.191
- THANKS.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.393
IT'S A BAD ONE.

00:59.427 --> 01:03.331
- UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T GET
TOO MANY GOOD ONES.

01:03.364 --> 01:06.434
- NCMEC? CHICAGO?
- INTERSTATE TRAFFICKING.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.736
THEY THINK ONE OF THEIR VICTMS
MAY BE FROM HERE.

01:08.769 --> 01:12.273
ALL RIGHT, FIVE MORE PUSHES,
NOAH, OKAY?

01:15.209 --> 01:17.445
- HEY, YOU WORK WITH THOSE TWO
WHEN YOU WERE IN CHICAGO?

01:17.478 --> 01:20.181
IS THAT THE GUY
WHO HIT ON ROLLINS?

01:20.214 --> 01:22.750
- YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT?
NAH. SOME OTHER PRETTY BOY.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.185
- I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS
EACH OTHER.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.320
DETECTIVE LINDSAY,
JAY HALSTEAD--

01:26.354 --> 01:27.355
YOU REMEMBER
DETECTIVE TUTUOLA?

01:27.388 --> 01:29.223
- FIN, HOW ARE YOU?
- ALL RIGHT.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.625
- HEY, I GOT STUCK IN THE--
IN THE TUNNEL.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.761
- YOU TWO CAUGHT THIS
IN CHICAGO?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.296
- YEAH,
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.198
A FIRE VIC,
ANDREW LEWELLEN,

01:37.231 --> 01:38.332
HE HAD A BOX FULL
OF THESE IMAGES

01:38.366 --> 01:39.767
THAT ARE TRACEABLE
TO THIS FRANCHISE.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.269
- SO THEN DETECTIVE LINDSAY
RECOGNIZED

01:41.302 --> 01:43.137
ONE OF THE YOUNG VICTIMS.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.405
- TEDDY COURTNEY
IS MY HALF BROTHER.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.407
HE RAN AWAY TEN YEARS AGO.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.176
AND MY MOM WON'T TELL ME
HOW SHE KNOWS,

01:48.209 --> 01:50.578
BUT SHE KNOWS
HE CAME TO NEW YORK, SO...

01:50.611 --> 01:52.246
- AND THAT'S WHO WE'VE BEEN
TRYING TO LOCATE?

01:52.280 --> 01:54.348
- NCMEC RAN HIS FACE
THROUGH THE SYSTEM,

01:54.382 --> 01:56.217
AND THEY FOUND MORE IMAGES.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.187
AND HE'S CONNECTED
TO A PEOPHILIA RING.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.156
- THIS PEDOPHILIA CLUB
IS STILL ACTIVE,

02:02.190 --> 02:04.325
AND THEY'VE UPGRADED
TO LIVE STREAMING.

02:06.194 --> 02:09.363
- NOW, AND THE FEDS THINK THIS
CLUB STREAMS FROM NEW YORK?

02:09.397 --> 02:10.798
- THEY DON'T KNOW,

02:10.831 --> 02:13.301
BUT AS SOON AS WE FIND TEDDY,
WE'RE GONNA ASK HIM.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.403
- ASSUMING HE'S ALIVE.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.307
LOOK, I'M--I'M SORRY,
BUT A KID GOES THROUGH

02:19.340 --> 02:21.375
SOMETHING LIKE THAT--
- NICK--

02:21.409 --> 02:23.844
- YOU HAVEN'T FOUND HIM
IN THE SYSTEM?

02:23.877 --> 02:26.880
- NOT AS AN ADULT.
- WE TRY ALL AKAs,

02:26.914 --> 02:27.915
MISSPELLINGS.

02:27.948 --> 02:31.352

IN THE TRI-STATE AREA.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.621

02:40.494 --> 02:43.831
- YEAH.
WE'RE GONNA NEED YOUR DNA, TOO.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.971
- NO, PLEASE, PLEASE,
JUST LET ME GO.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.541
- HENRY, KEEP CRYING LIKE THAT,
AND I'LL HAVE TO GAG YOU.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.976
- NO. NO.
- THAT'S BETTER.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.077
AND NOW, WE HAVE
A SPECIAL REQUEST

02:57.110 --> 03:00.348
FROM ONE OF OUR MEMBERS--
GRONKU IN THE MIDWEST...

03:00.381 --> 03:01.782
- WHERE IS THIS STREAMING FROM?

03:01.815 --> 03:03.551
- BY THE ACCENTS,
IT SEEMS DOMESTIC,

03:03.584 --> 03:06.787
BUT FLORIDA, CANADA, QUEENS--
WE DON'T KNOW.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.889
- SO HOW DOES THIS TIE IN
WITH THE PHOTOS CHICAGO FOUND?

03:08.922 --> 03:10.924
- THOSE WERE SCREEN SHOTS
FROM TEN YEARS AGO,

03:10.958 --> 03:14.595
WHEN THIS SAME ORGANIZATION
FILE SHARED VIDEOS.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.698
CALLS ITSELF
THE CHESS & CHECKERS CLUB.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.334
- STOP WRIGGLING.
- STOP, PLEASE!

HENRY,

03:22.002 --> 03:24.338
- NO.
- JUST IN CASE YOU FEEL LIKE

03:24.372 --> 03:26.240
YOU'RE GOING TO CRY AGAIN.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.276
- THE CLUB MEMBERS
MAKING REQUESTS

03:28.309 --> 03:30.878
ARE WATCHING
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.881
- AND THEY'RE--THEY'RE PAYING
THROUGH ENCRYPTED LINKS?

03:33.914 --> 03:37.251
- AND THE FEDS KNOW ALL OF THIS,
AND YOU CAN'T SHUT IT DOWN?

03:37.285 --> 03:40.654
- WE'RE TRYING,
BUT SO FAR, NO.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.491
- THEN WE WILL.
- I WANNA GO HOME!

04:34.041 --> 04:34.775

- I DON'T KNOW.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.978

- AM I INTERRUPTING?

04:38.011 --> 04:40.581
- NO. ANYTHING YET?
- NO.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.617
I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME
TO CALL IT A NIGHT.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.853
- I'M WAITING ON ACCESS
TO THE JERSEY DATABASE.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.655
SO LET ME SHAKE THAT TREE AGAIN.
- THANKS.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.060
- ARE YOU OKAY?

04:53.093 --> 04:55.028
JUST LOOKING AT THOSE PICTURES,
IT'S GOT TO BE ROUGH.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.531
- IT IS.

04:57.565 --> 05:00.768
YOU KNOW, IT COULD EASILY
HAVE BEEN ME.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.772
GROWING UP
WAS, UH, CHAOTIC.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.608
I HAVEN'T SEEN TEDDY
IN A LONG TIME.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.744
MY FAMILY...

05:10.778 --> 05:12.713
COMPLICATED.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.882
- I HAVE A SISTER I HAVEN'T
SPOKEN TO IN TWO YEARS.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.684
ALSO COMPLICATED.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.652
- WE MAY HAVE SOMETHING--

05:18.686 --> 05:22.723
- WELL, WE GOT SOME
AGED-UP PHOTOS OF TEDDY.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.459

ABOUT 17.

NOW, CHECK OUT THIS MUG SHOT
FROM JUVIE--

TED VOIGHT FIVE YEARS AGO

- VOIGHT?

05:35.803 --> 05:38.606
- YEAH, THEY USED TO KNOW
EACH OTHER. THAT'S TEDDY.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.708
- WHAT WAS THE DISPOSITION
OF HIS CASE?

05:40.741 --> 05:42.543
- HE WAS REMANDED
TO A YOUTH CENTER.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.612
- THERE'S NO SUBSEQUENT ARRESTS,
NOTHING ELSE IN PUBLIC RECORDS.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.547
- WHY DON'T I GO TALK TO
THE PEOPLE AT THE CENTER?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.616
- LET US TAKE THE FIRST MEET.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.922
- TEDDY VOIGHT--
REPEAT CUSTOMER.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.990
WE HAVE MORE THAN A FEW
OF THOSE.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.427
OUR PROGRAM HAS A GOOD RECORD
WITH STREET KIDS.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.828
BUT SOME OF THEM--
- ARE LIKE TEDDY.

06:00.861 --> 06:04.998
- YEAH, HE GOT SENT HERE TWICE,
RAN AWAY BOTH TIMES.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.601
WAS HERE LESS THAN A WEEK
HIS LAST STINT.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.637
- KIDS CAN JUST RUN AWAY?
I MEAN, YOU HAVE SECURITY.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.071
- TO KEEP THE STREET OUT,
NOT OUR RESIDENTS IN.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.973
THIS ISN'T A PRISON.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.908
HEY, YOU REMEMBER HIM, GEORGE?

06:14.942 --> 06:17.745
- UH, SO MANY KIDS,
MS. BAGLEY. NO.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.780
- SO WHY NOW?
WHAT DID HE DO?

06:19.813 --> 06:23.717
- NO, IT'S WHAT GOT DONE TO HIM,
BY PEDOPHILES WHEN HE WAS 13.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.987
- 13? SO AFTER THE FIRST TIME
HE RAN AWAY.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.156
ALL OUR KIDS ARE DAMAGED,

06:29.189 --> 06:31.091
BUT SOME ARE MORE DAMAGED
THAN OTHERS.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.927
- WELL, ANY IDEA
WHERE TEDDY MIGHT BE NOW?

06:33.961 --> 06:36.464
- NOWHERE YOU'D WANT TO TAKE
THE WIFE AND KIDS.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.832
- COME ON, THINK,
IS THERE ANYONE

06:38.866 --> 06:41.034
WHO MAY HAVE STAYED IN TOUCH
WITH HIM?

06:42.703 --> 06:44.004
- THERE WAS A GIRL
THE LAST TIME.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.649
THAT WAS ANOTHER LIFE AGO.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.685

IS PROBABLY A GOOD THING.

MRS. BAGLEY AT THE YOUTH CENTER
SAID THAT YOU WERE DOING GREAT.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.756
- I'M GONNA GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL
THIS YEAR. GO TO COLLEGE.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.692
- SO THE LAST THING YOU NEED
IS A FRIEND LIKE TEDDY.

07:04.725 --> 07:08.762
- HE'S NOT EXACTLY A FRIEND.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.664
I KNEW HIM FROM THE LIFE.

07:10.698 --> 07:14.602
DID MS. BAGLEY TELL YOU WHY
I WAS AT THE YOUTH CENTER?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.203
- NO.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.606
- BUT YOU CHECKED MY RECORD?

07:21.942 --> 07:24.144
YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO
A 14-YEAR-OLD PROSTITUTE.

YOU'RE TALKING TO SOMEONE
WHO'S GONNA BE A TEACHER.

WE'RE NOT JUDGING YOU.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.683

WE--WE'RE JUST HOPING THAT
YOU WOULD HAVE SOME IDEA

07:32.085 --> 07:34.988

YEARS AGO.

WHEN HE DISAPPEARED?

08:24.304 --> 08:26.006

10:36.303 --> 10:37.905
DOES SHE KNOW WHAT YOU WERE?

10:37.938 --> 10:39.139
- TEDDY, SHE CAME HERE
TO HELP YOU.

10:39.172 --> 10:42.375
- I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU,
MAMA BEAR.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.345
- TEDDY.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.847
I REALLY DO
WANT TO HELP.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.315
- NOW?

10:48.348 --> 10:50.250
WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN I WAS 13?

10:50.283 --> 10:52.385
WHERE WAS OUR ALLEGED MOTHER?

10:52.419 --> 10:55.255
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.124
I'M SORRY.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.326
YOU KNOW, SHE WASN'T THERE
TO TAKE CARE OF ME, EITHER.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.795
- VOIGHT TOOK CARE OF YOU.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.833
YOU WANT TO HELP?

11:05.866 --> 11:07.467
GIVE ME THE HUNDRED
YOU JUST COST ME.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.336
LET ME GO BACK
TO MY FRIENDS.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.971
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
TEDDY.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.272
WE--WE HAVE GOT YOU
ON NARCOTICS POSSESSION.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.342
- [sighs]
- YOU WERE HOLDING.

11:17.811 --> 11:21.281
- OH, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
YOU STILL HAVE MY BACK.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.350
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT,

11:23.383 --> 11:26.186
BUT I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.395
- THIS HAS GOTTA BE BRUTAL
FOR LINDSAY.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.965
YOU KNOW, SHE HAD IT
REALLY ROUGH GROWING UP.

11:37.998 --> 11:41.368
AND NOW, HER BROTHER.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.370
- WELL, IT'S TOUGHER
WHEN IT'S PERSONAL.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.272
- YEAH.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.207
SHE'S THE TOUGHEST COP
I KNOW.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.746
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.081
WE WORK TOGETHER.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.449
- OH, WE GET IT.
- TOTALLY.

12:02.255 --> 12:05.458
- HEY.
IT GETS PRETTY COLD IN HERE.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.898
TEDDY, I WANT TO GET YOU OUT OF
HERE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.465
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.801
- [sighs]

12:17.871 --> 12:20.207
- WHEN YOU WERE 13,
YOU RAN AWAY TO NEW YORK,

12:20.240 --> 12:22.876
AND YOU WENT TO A SHELTER.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.211
AND THEN YOU RAN AWAY
FROM THERE.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.979
WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.548
- GOOD TIMES.
- NO, TEDDY, NOT GOOD TIMES.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.418
I-I SAW THE--THE PHOTOS.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.789
AND YOUR SISTER DID, TOO.
THAT'S WHY SHE CAME HERE,

12:35.823 --> 12:37.390
TO FIND YOU.

12:37.424 --> 12:41.028
- [scoffs]

12:41.061 --> 12:42.796
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:42.830 --> 12:47.300
- THE SAME PEOPLE WHO DID THAT
TO YOU TEN YEARS AGO

12:47.334 --> 12:49.970
ARE DOING IT
TO OTHER KIDS NOW.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.139
THEY'RE DOING IT TO HIM.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.307
THIS LITTLE BOY'S NAME IS HENRY.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.945
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU CAN TELL US

12:57.978 --> 13:00.213
ABOUT WHERE THIS TOOK PLACE
OR WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.282
I WANT TO SAVE
THIS LITTLE BOY,

13:02.315 --> 13:05.585
AND I WANNA SAVE WHOEVER ELSE
THEY MAY HAVE.

13:05.618 --> 13:09.189
- IT'S TOO LATE.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.258
- IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.927
THAT'S THE THING.

13:13.961 --> 13:17.130
WE TALKED TO ONE OF
YOUR FRIENDS, JOCELYN.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.399
- JOCELYN?

13:19.432 --> 13:21.568
- AND SHE IS DOING GREAT.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.336
SHE'S IN SCHOOL.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.845
TEDDY, IT CAN HAPPEN.

13:31.879 --> 13:34.081
- [sighs]

13:34.114 --> 13:37.117
THANK YOU FOR THE BLANKET.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.386
I'M TIRED.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.996
- OKAY, HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.397
HE WON'T TALK TO YOU.
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.199
- WE WAIT.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.234
WE TRY AGAIN.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.369
WE KEEP TRYING.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.106
- AND THEN MEANWHILE, HE RUNS
AWAY OR HE'S BACK ON THE PIERS?

13:59.139 --> 14:00.540
- MEANWHILE, HE'S LOCKED UP.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.509
WE HAVE HIM ON DRUG POSSESSION
AND SOLICITATION.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.244
- BUT HE'S THE VICTIM HERE.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.946
- LINDSAY,
YOU WANT HIM TO RUN AWAY?

14:05.979 --> 14:07.414
YOU WANT HIM TO RUN BACK
TO THE PIERS?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.649
- NO.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.320
- CAN YOU THINK OF ANYONE
THAT HE MAY HAVE CONFIDED IN?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.322
MAYBE YOUR MOTHER?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.357
- IF HE DID,
SHE WOULDN'T REMEMBER.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.092
- YOU NEED ANYTHING FROM US,
SARGE?

14:19.126 --> 14:22.229
- I DON'T KNOW. WE HAVE HIT
A WALL WITH OUR FRIEND TEDDY.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.663
- HIS FRIEND, JOCELYN,

14:23.696 --> 14:27.234
WAS RIGHT ABOUT HIM
WORKING THE PIERS.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.335
SHE MIGHT KNOW MORE.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.537
- TAKE ANOTHER RUN AT HER.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.176
- YOU FOUND TEDDY?
GREAT.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.211
SO, WE'RE DONE.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.413
- WELL, WE STILL NEED
SOME BACKGROUND ON HIM.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.682
ALL RIGHT, WHEN WAS IT
THAT YOU TWO FIRST MET?

14:42.715 --> 14:45.552
- I DON'T KNOW.
ON THE STREET.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.354
- LOOK, DID--DID HE EVER
TALK TO YOU

14:47.387 --> 14:49.489
ABOUT HIS EARLY DAYS
IN NEW YORK?

14:49.522 --> 14:53.226
- NOT REALLY.
WHY?

14:53.260 --> 14:54.261
- WHEN HE WAS 13,

14:54.294 --> 14:58.331
TEDDY WAS THE VICTIM
OF A SEX TRAFFICKING RING.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.070
- HE WAS THE VICTIM?

15:03.103 --> 15:05.172
- YEAH.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.943
- JOCELYN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:09.977 --> 15:12.245
- UM, NOTHING.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.315
I-I DON'T NEED THIS NOW.
I HAVE TO GET TO CLASS.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.584
- JOCELYN, HEY, WAIT!

15:19.519 --> 15:21.554
- WELL, DID YOU MENTION
THE PEDOPHILE RING

15:21.588 --> 15:23.190
THE FIRST TIME
YOU TALKED TO HER?

15:23.223 --> 15:26.126
- NO, BUT SHE GOT ARRESTED
AT 14 FOR HOOKING.

15:26.159 --> 15:29.029
I'M GUESSING WE KNOW
HOW SHE GOT TURNED OUT.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.266
- THIS IS JOCELYN CERPASKI'S
MUG SHOT

15:33.300 --> 15:35.202
FROM A PROSTITUTION ARREST
FIVE YEARS AGO.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.436
- AND YOU RAN HER FACE
THROUGH THE SYSTEM?

15:36.469 --> 15:39.106
- YEAH.
AND HIT THE BAD JACKPOT.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.444
- SHE WAS RAPED, BEAT UP.
SAME AS TEDDY.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.279
- THEY DIDN'T JUST KNOW
EACH OTHER FROM THE STREETS.

15:46.313 --> 15:50.583
- THESE IMAGES ARE FROM THE SAME
CHESS & CHECKERS CLUB.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.419
IN THIS ONE,
A MEMBER NAMED BIGMAN

15:52.452 --> 15:55.422
PAID TO SEE
STRAIGHT INTERCOURSE.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.658
- WELL, SHE LOOKS TERRIFIED.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.393
WAIT, RIGHT THERE.
THAT TATTOO.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.295
THAT'S TEDDY.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.768
- SO WHO GETS
TO TELL LINDSAY?

16:08.801 --> 16:11.404
- SO WHEN I MENTIONED JOCELYN
LAST NIGHT, YOU SHUT DOWN.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.240
IS THAT WHY?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.542
- THAT'S JUST ANOTHER DAY
AT THE OFFICE.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.410
- SHE'S A CHILD, TEDDY.
THAT'S RAPE.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.712
- THEY CAN SEND YOU AWAY
FOR 20 YEARS.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.381
- I DON'T SEE YOU
FOR 10 YEARS,

16:21.414 --> 16:23.250
NOW YOU WANT TO LOCK ME UP
FOR 20?

16:23.283 --> 16:25.085
ONE HELL OF A BIG SISTER.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.720
- TEDDY, THAT'S NOT WHAT
ANY OF US WANT.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.190
WHAT WE WANT
IS FOR YOU TO HELP US

16:30.223 --> 16:33.193
GET THE PEOPLE
WHO MADE YOU DO THIS TO HER.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.494
- NOBODY MADE ME.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.330
- HOW MANY VIDEOS
DID THEY FORCE YOU TO DO?

16:37.364 --> 16:40.067
STARTING AT 13.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.572
TEDDY, WE KNOW THAT NONE OF THIS
WAS YOUR CHOICE.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.308
- WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
- IT DOES MATTER.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.477
BECAUSE THEY DRUGGED YOU.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.479
THEY BROKE YOU,

16:52.512 --> 16:54.581
AND THEN THEY TWISTED YOU.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.116
- [laughs]

16:56.149 --> 16:58.318
- THIS ISN'T YOU.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.388
AND THIS ISN'T YOU.

17:03.456 --> 17:07.727
I KNOW THAT.
YOU WERE THE SWEETEST BOY.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.297
YOU WOULD NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.074
- BUT I DID.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.276
I HAD TO.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.179
- SO THEY FORCED YOU.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.116
- NO. IT WAS MY IDEA.

17:29.149 --> 17:33.153
BECAUSE I KNEW WHO
THEY'D SEND IN IF IT WASN'T ME--

17:33.186 --> 17:35.655
SOMEONE OLDER,
SOMEONE ROUGHER.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.491
SHE WASN'T READY FOR THAT.
JOCELYN WAS MY FRIEND!

17:40.393 --> 17:42.162
AND YOU'RE RIGHT,
THEY WERE DONE WITH ME.

17:42.195 --> 17:46.199
I-I COULD DO WHAT I WANT.
SO I-I-I WENT OUT ON MY OWN.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.434
- UNTIL YOU WERE ARRESTED.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.802
- ABOUT A YEAR LATER.

17:49.836 --> 17:53.340
I-I SAW JOCELYN AT THE CENTER.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.575
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.547
- SHE'S OKAY NOW.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.150
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HELP US
STOP THESE PEOPLE.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.451
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

18:04.484 --> 18:06.486
I WAS A KID.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.321
I NEVER KNEW WHERE I WAS.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.324
I NEVER KNEW ANYBODY'S NAME.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.826
I WAS IN A DARK ROOM
ON A LOUSY MATTRESS

18:13.860 --> 18:17.230
EATING CORN CHIPS
WHEN I WASN'T DOING--

18:17.264 --> 18:18.631
- OKAY, OKAY, TEDDY.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.368
WHERE DID THIS HAPPEN?

18:21.401 --> 18:24.171
- A BUNCH--
A BUNCH OF PLACES.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.173
I DON'T KNOW.
ALL CRAPPY.

18:26.206 --> 18:29.642
- DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THE MEN WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

18:29.676 --> 18:33.112
- IT WAS DIFFERENT MEN,
COMING AND GOING.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.349
THERE WAS--

18:36.383 --> 18:38.885
THERE WAS ONE GUY...

18:38.918 --> 18:40.620
[sighs]

18:40.653 --> 18:42.855
EVERYBODY WAS SCARED OF.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.358
- DID THEY CALL HIM
BY NAME?

18:48.495 --> 18:50.430
WAS HE IN ANY
OF THE VIDEOS?

18:50.463 --> 18:51.798
- NEVER ON CAMERA.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.900
HE WOULD JUST COME
IN AT NIGHT

18:53.933 --> 18:57.537
AND DO ME
IN THE DARK SOMETIMES.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.273
- WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

19:00.307 --> 19:02.775
- WHITE,

19:02.809 --> 19:05.612
UH, MIDDLE-AGED GUY,

19:05.645 --> 19:07.214
AVERAGE.

19:07.247 --> 19:11.351
- OKAY, HOW DID THEY GET TO YOU
INITIALLY?

19:11.384 --> 19:13.853
- THE FIRST TIME THAT I WENT TO
THE YOUTH CENTER, I HATED IT.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.922
AND THERE WAS THIS GUY
WHO WORKED THERE.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.458
HE SAID HE--HE KNEW A WAY
I COULD GET OUT,

19:18.491 --> 19:21.394
MAKE SOME MONEY,
HAVE A ROOM OF MY OWN.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.463
- WHAT GUY, TEDDY?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.865
WHAT GUY WAS THAT?

19:25.898 --> 19:27.700
- GEORGE,
OUR SECURITY GUARD?

19:27.734 --> 19:29.402
- YES.
- HE'S BEEN WITH US FOR YEARS.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.537
- BUT IT MAKES SENSE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

19:30.570 --> 19:33.306
I MEAN,
WHERE BETTER TO RECRUIT?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.774
- HE LIKES THE KIDS.
HE TALKS TO THEM ALL THE TIME.

19:34.807 --> 19:35.642
- STILL?

19:35.675 --> 19:39.479
- HE BEEN TALKING TO
ANY BOYS LATELY?

19:39.512 --> 19:42.349
- OH, GOD. ONE.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.216
HENRY.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.917
GEORGE SAID HE RAN AWAY
A WEEK AGO.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.787
- OKAY, IS THIS HENRY?

19:52.292 --> 19:54.761
- WHERE IS GEORGE NOW?

20:05.705 --> 20:09.309
- SVU SERGEANT IN PURSUIT
OF A MALE, WHITE,

20:09.342 --> 20:11.911
40S.
11TH AVENUE,

20:11.944 --> 20:14.381
HEADING SOUTHBOUND TOWARD 24TH.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.683
- COME ON! ERIN!
- ERIN!

20:16.716 --> 20:20.353
YOU OKAY?
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

20:20.387 --> 20:21.888
- GO. GO.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.794
- [grunting]

20:27.827 --> 20:29.896
- GET UP.
PUT YOUR HANDS UP.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.632
- EASY. WE GOT HIM.
WE GOT HIM.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.268
ERIN?
YOU OKAY?

20:35.302 --> 20:37.704
- YOU OKAY?

20:39.839 --> 20:42.241
- ERIN.

20:49.349 --> 20:49.549
.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.417
- HEY, YOU FLEW IN FOR NOTHING.
I'M FINE.

20:51.384 --> 20:54.053
I'M GOING BACK TO SVU.
- YOU GOT A CONCUSSION.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.922
YOU'RE GOING BACK TO CHICAGO.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.891
- AND WHAT HAPPENS TO TEDDY?
- YOU DID YOUR PART.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.594
I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED OUT
FOR HIM, OKAY?

21:01.628 --> 21:03.763
IT'S ON ME.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.999
- EVERYONE LOVED YOU
THE OTHER NIGHT.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.035
- PLEASE, NO.
[knock at door]

21:09.068 --> 21:11.971
- AH, SERGEANT VOIGHT.
COME ON IN.

21:12.004 --> 21:15.908
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU IN PERSON.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.577
- HOW'S LINDSAY?
- FEISTY.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.612
I'M SENDING HER HOME
UNDER PROTEST.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.614
HALSTEAD'S WITH HER.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.950
- PLEASE LET ME OUT OF HERE.
I NEED TO GO.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.453
- WHO'S THAT?
- HENRY THORNE, 12.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.021
PEDOPHILE RING'S HAD HIM
FOR ALMOST A WEEK.

21:29.055 --> 21:32.525
- PLEASE...
DON'T HURT ME ANYMORE.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.494
- HE WAS TRAFFICKED
FROM A LOCAL YOUTH CENTER.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.495
NCMEC JUST CALLED.
- NO...

21:35.528 --> 21:37.964
- THIS IS...
STREAMING LIVE.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.400
- BE A GOOD BOY
AND LOOK AT THE CAMERA.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.869
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- I DIDN'T ASK IF YOU WANTED TO.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.771
NOW, LOOK AT THE DAMN CAMERA.

21:46.873 --> 21:49.342
I WANT PEOPLE TO SEE YOU, HENRY.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.777
BECAUSE TONIGHT

21:50.810 --> 21:53.480
YOU'RE GONNA BE PUTTING ON
A VERY SPECIAL SHOW.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.914
- [crying]

21:54.947 --> 21:57.817
- CLUB MEMBERS,
REQUESTS FOR GENRE ACTIVITIES

21:57.850 --> 21:59.919
WILL BE ACCEPTED STARTING NOW.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.689
USUAL TERMS--
CREDIT CARDS OR BITCOIN.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.824
- MY GOD.
- YEAH.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.394
- TONIGHT IS GONNA BE
A GOOD ONE.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.834
- THESE THE SAME PEOPLE
WHO HAD TEDDY?

22:14.867 --> 22:17.404
- YEAH.
- YOU HAVE A SUSPECT HERE?

22:17.437 --> 22:19.906
- YEAH.
HE GOT HURT DURING THE CHASE,

22:19.939 --> 22:21.541
SO HE INSISTED ON GOING
TO THE HOSPITAL,

22:21.574 --> 22:24.010
BUT WE'RE BRINGING HIM IN NOW
FOR QUESTIONING.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.381
- THAT'S WHERE HENRY IS NOW,
GEORGE.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.483
HENRY, YOUR FRIEND.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.151
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW HE GOT THERE?

22:32.184 --> 22:33.886
- WELL, THESE KIDS RUN AWAY.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.955
- YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
HE'D END UP LIKE THAT, DID YOU?

22:35.988 --> 22:37.824
I MEAN, THAT--
YOU'RE A FAMILY MAN.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.526
YOU'RE A DECENT GUY.
- YEAH, I AM.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.027
- AND YOU REALLY DO LIKE
THE KIDS AT THE CENTER.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.929
I MEAN,
THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.964
- RIGHT, SO MAYBE YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE DOING THEM A FAVOR,

22:44.997 --> 22:47.567
RIGHT, BY SETTING THEM UP
WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP THEM?

22:47.600 --> 22:49.101
- YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T
SET ANYBODY UP, OKAY?

22:49.135 --> 22:50.970
I-I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.672
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE BELIEVE YOU, GEORGE.

22:52.705 --> 22:56.008
JUST--JUST TELL US
WHAT YOU DO KNOW.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.511
[telephone ringing]

22:58.545 --> 23:01.581
- YOU CALL THIS
AN INTERROGATION?

23:01.614 --> 23:03.816
WHY DON'T YOU PUT ON SOME MUSIC
AND DANCE WITH THE GUY?

23:03.850 --> 23:05.418
- BENSON.

23:05.452 --> 23:08.054
- BOSS, I JUST TALKED TO A KID
AT THE YOUTH CENTER.

23:08.087 --> 23:11.558
HE SAID HE SAW HENRY GET INTO A
GRAY SUV THE DAY HE DISAPPEARED.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.793
NEW YORK PLATES,
BUT HE DIDN'T GET THE NUMBER.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.194
- GRAY SUV?

23:15.227 --> 23:17.530
OKAY. CALL D.O.T.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.632
CHECK TRAFFIC CAMS.
THANKS, FIN.

23:19.666 --> 23:20.967
- DONE.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.134
- PROGRESS.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.970
- PLATES?

23:24.003 --> 23:26.906
LOOK, WHY DON'T I GO IN THERE
AND HELP THEM?

23:28.140 --> 23:31.678
- I DON'T CONTACT THEM--
- HELLO, GEORGE.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.480
I'M SERGEANT VOIGHT.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.882
I'M GONNA BE ASSISTING
THESE DETECTIVES.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.450
- EXCUSE ME?
- I'M FROM CHICAGO.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.085
WE DO THINGS
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THERE.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.120
- OKAY, WELL,
I'VE JUST BEEN TELLING THEM

23:41.153 --> 23:43.222
HOW THIS IS ALL A MISTAKE.
- WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME, GEORGE,

23:43.255 --> 23:45.124
YOU'RE THE ONE
MAKING THE MISTAKE--

23:45.157 --> 23:48.461
PIMPING CHILDREN OUT TO RAPISTS.
- I DIDN'T PIMP ANY CHILDREN.

23:48.495 --> 23:51.163
- AND WHILE THEY'RE GETTING
BEAT UP AND VIOLATED,

23:51.197 --> 23:53.232
YOU'RE SITTING HERE IN
THIS NICE, COMFORTABLE CHAIR.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.934
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
I--

23:54.967 --> 23:56.869
- THAT'S NOT VERY COOPERATIVE.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.005
- OH!

23:59.038 --> 24:00.206
- WHERE'S THE BOY?

24:00.239 --> 24:02.542
- I DON'T KNOW.
- WRONG ANSWER.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.243
- SERGEANT VOIGHT.
- I GOT THIS.

24:04.276 --> 24:08.180
YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE RAPED, GEORGE?

24:13.285 --> 24:15.221
POWERLESS.
- SERGEANT VOIGHT.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.590
MY OFFICE NOW.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.646
- WHAT ARE YOUR PEOPLE DOING,

24:39.679 --> 24:41.648
RATIONALIZE, PROJECT,
MINIMIZE?

24:41.681 --> 24:44.016
I READ THAT HANDBOOK.
- IT WORKS.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.985
- SO DOES TERRORIZE
WHEN IT'S CALLED FOR.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.020
- BELIEVE ME, I UNDERSTAND
THAT ONE ALL TOO WELL.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.089
I HAD A PARTNER
THAT USED TO WORK LIKE THAT.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.158
AND SOMETIMES
IT WAS EFFECTIVE,

24:52.191 --> 24:55.962
AND SOMETIMES IT LED
TO FALSE CONFESSIONS

24:55.995 --> 24:58.064
AND OVERTURNED CONVICTIONS.

24:58.097 --> 25:01.167
IF YOU ALIGN YOURSELF
WITH A PERP'S WORLD VIEW,

25:01.200 --> 25:03.670
YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED.
- I GET THERE FASTER.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.738
- NOT LEGALLY.

25:05.772 --> 25:09.275
- WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BOX,
STAYS IN THE BOX.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.310
- MAYBE IN CHICAGO,

25:11.343 --> 25:15.047
BUT YOU'RE
IN NEW YORK CITY NOW.

25:15.081 --> 25:18.685
AND LET ME REMIND YOU THAT
YOU'RE HERE AS A COURTESY.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.653
YOU HAVE NO JURISDICTION.

25:20.687 --> 25:23.656
IF YOU PULL THAT CRAP AGAIN,
I PROMISE YOU,

25:23.690 --> 25:25.792
I WILL ARREST YOU.

25:25.825 --> 25:29.195
- HEY, FOLKS. GETTING LOTS OF
REQUESTS FOR OUR FRIEND, HENRY.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.731
IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN
SPECIAL REQUEST, GET 'EM IN NOW.

25:31.764 --> 25:34.000
JUST THREE HOURS
TO SHOWTIME.

25:34.033 --> 25:37.069
SMILE FOR THE CAMERA, HENRY.
- NO.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.207
- YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA
HOW TO MAKE PROGRESS HERE,

25:48.114 --> 25:48.314
.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.315
- ALL RIGHT, SO TARU
STILL CAN'T TRACE THAT FEED.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.417
NEITHER CAN NCMEC.
- SHOWTIME IN TWO HOURS.

25:51.450 --> 25:54.721
- THE YOUTH CENTER IS STILL
LOOKING FOR HENRY'S PARENTS.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.623
- SO THEY CAN WATCH THIS?

25:56.656 --> 25:58.991
- PLEASE.
PLEASE LET ME GO!

25:59.025 --> 26:02.629
- THERE'S HENRY, GEORGE.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.597
IT'S NOT QUITE
WHAT YOU EXPECTED, IS IT?

26:04.631 --> 26:07.967
BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW.
OR YOU DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.301
- WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO HIM?

26:09.335 --> 26:11.938
- HE'S GONNA BE RAPED.

26:11.971 --> 26:15.708
HE'S GONNA BE HIT.
HE MIGHT BE KILLED.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.277
- AND WHEN THEY DO IT,
YOU'RE GONNA BE JUST AS GUILTY.

26:18.310 --> 26:21.013
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SOLD HIM TO THEM.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.149
- NO.
- NO?

26:23.182 --> 26:25.284
YOU KNOW, WE TOOK A LOOK
AT YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.355
YOU USUALLY HIT THE ATM
A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK,

26:29.388 --> 26:32.859
BUT YOU HAVEN'T DONE THAT
IN A WHILE.

26:32.892 --> 26:35.027
DID YOU COME INTO SOME CASH,
GEORGE?

26:35.061 --> 26:38.197
- YEAH. I DID SOME ODD JOBS.
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

26:38.230 --> 26:41.768
I THINK THAT I'M GONNA LET YOU
EXPLAIN THAT

26:41.801 --> 26:44.336
TO SERGEANT VOIGHT
WHILE I GO GET SOME COFFEE.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.306
- NO! NO! NO, NO, DON'T--
DON'T LEAVE ME WITH HIM!

26:47.339 --> 26:51.277
- GIVE ME ONE REASON TO STAY.
GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON, GEORGE.

26:54.280 --> 26:58.050
- THEY SAID THEY NEEDED ACTORS,
YOUNG ACTORS.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.052
- YOU'RE THAT STUPID?

27:00.086 --> 27:03.055
- I MAKE $12 AN HOUR
DOWN AT THE YOUTH CENTER, OKAY?

27:03.089 --> 27:04.857
I HAVE A KID IN COLLEGE.

27:04.891 --> 27:07.326
THEY GIVE ME $1,000
WHEN I SEND THEM SOMEONE.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.195
- SO WHEN YOUR KID
GOES TO COLLEGE,

27:09.228 --> 27:10.930
THE BOY THAT YOU SOLD--

27:10.963 --> 27:13.065
- TALK!

27:13.099 --> 27:14.767
NOW.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.036
- I GET A CALL
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, OKAY?

27:17.069 --> 27:19.939
THE GUY NEVER TOLD ME HIS NAME.
HE JUST GIVES ME THE MONEY.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.808
HE PICKS UP THE KID.
- IN A GRAY SUV?

27:21.841 --> 27:23.409
- YEAH! I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE TAKES THEM.

27:23.442 --> 27:26.145
- NOT GOOD ENOUGH, GEORGE.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.814
- UM...

27:27.847 --> 27:29.982
UM...
WHEN HE CAME TO PICK UP HENRY,

27:30.016 --> 27:31.884
HE--HE WAS--HE WAS MAD
BECAUSE I WAS LATE.

27:31.918 --> 27:34.386
AND HE SAID IN ORDER
TO BEAT THE TRAFFIC HOME

27:34.420 --> 27:37.757
HE HAD TO PAY A DOUBLE TOLL--
$22.50.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.359
HE TOOK IT OUT OF MY MONEY.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.298
- GEORGE IS HERE?
THE GUARD FROM THE CENTER?

27:46.332 --> 27:50.002
- YEAH, BUT, TEDDY,
WE STILL NEED YOUR HELP.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.071
- WAIT, SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.006
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO BOUNCE THE GUY AROUND,

27:54.040 --> 27:55.942
BUT YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO THREATEN THAT I WILL?

27:55.975 --> 27:58.344
- I'M JUST USING THE CARDS
THAT I'M DEALT.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.012
- MM-HMM.
- DID YOU GET ANYTHING?

28:00.046 --> 28:03.015
- NOT ENOUGH.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.984
- HEY, TEDDY.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.685
LONG TIME.

28:08.855 --> 28:12.892
- VOIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

28:12.925 --> 28:15.828
- I'M SORRY, OKAY?

28:15.862 --> 28:18.430
I SHOULD HAVE
KEPT A BETTER EYE ON YOU.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.800
- I WASN'T AS PRETTY
AS ERIN.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.237
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU'D DISAPPEAR.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.974
- WELL, PRESTO, HERE I AM.

28:28.007 --> 28:31.177
- HEY, GUYS, THERE'S GONNA BE
PLENTY OF TIME TO TALK LATER.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.846
RIGHT NOW, TEDDY,
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.916
WE NEED TO FIND THIS ROOM.

28:36.949 --> 28:38.885
IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT IT
THAT LOOKS FAMILIAR?

28:38.918 --> 28:42.154
THE COLOR OF THE WALLS?
THIS LAMP MAYBE?

28:42.188 --> 28:44.323
- NO.
- ARE YOU SURE?

28:44.356 --> 28:47.459
COME ON, JUST LOOK AGAIN.
- I LEFT THAT A LONG TIME AGO.

28:47.493 --> 28:50.029
- TEDDY, COME HERE.
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?

28:52.164 --> 28:55.467
WILL YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT AND
SEE IF ANYTHING COMES TO YOU?

28:55.501 --> 28:57.904
- [sighs]

28:57.937 --> 28:59.872
- WE TALKED TO THAT GIRL,
JOCELYN,

28:59.906 --> 29:01.941
WHO'S BEEN IN THE ROOM
MORE RECENTLY.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.976
MAYBE SHE'LL REMEMBER SOMETHING.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.511
- SO BRING HER IN.
- WE WENT PRETTY HARD AT HER.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.379
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO REMEMBER
ANYTHING.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.016
SHE HATES COPS.
SHE--SHE WON'T COME.

29:10.049 --> 29:13.052
- THEN ARREST HER.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.054
- FOR WHAT?

29:15.087 --> 29:18.390
- POINT TAKEN.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.392
BENSON,

29:20.426 --> 29:23.529
YOU ANY GOOD
AT UNDERCOVER?

29:29.268 --> 29:31.503
- I TOLD YOU, NO.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.539
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?

29:33.572 --> 29:35.908
- I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY WILL.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.576
- WHO?

29:37.609 --> 29:40.279
- THE PARENTS
OF THE CURRENT VICTIM.

29:42.982 --> 29:46.485
- THIS IS MR. AND MRS. THORNE.
- HI. HI.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.988
- JOCELYN?

29:49.021 --> 29:51.057
IS THAT YOUR NAME?

29:52.491 --> 29:54.560
YOU'RE OUR LAST HOPE.

29:54.593 --> 29:57.029
THE POLICE SAID THAT
YOU COULD HELP US.

29:57.063 --> 29:59.832
- OUR SON IS ONLY 12 YEARS OLD.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.267
WE HAD NO IDEA

30:01.300 --> 30:04.103
THAT HE WAS SO UNHAPPY
THAT HE WOULD RUN AWAY.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.039
- THEY SAY HE'S BEING HELD
PRISONER BY PEOPLE

30:07.073 --> 30:09.842
WHO ABUSE CHILDREN...

30:09.876 --> 30:11.610
IN THE WORST WAY.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.913
- I PROMISE YOU WE'RE GONNA BE
BETTER PARENTS.

30:13.946 --> 30:17.884
SO PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU--
I'M--I'M BEGGING YOU TO HELP US.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.285
- I'M SORRY, I--

30:19.318 --> 30:21.053
- SHOW HER THE PICTURE, PLEASE.

30:21.087 --> 30:23.522
PICTURE.

30:23.555 --> 30:26.058
- THIS IS HENRY.

30:26.092 --> 30:28.227
THIS IS OUR SON.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.999
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE GONNA DO TO HIM?

30:35.601 --> 30:37.937
- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE.

30:49.115 --> 30:51.017
- HALSTEAD, YOU'RE BACK.

30:51.050 --> 30:54.987
UH, THESE ARE
HENRY'S PARENTS.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.522
- RIGHT.
- YEAH, SO LET'S MAKE SURE

30:56.555 --> 30:58.524
THAT THEY GET SOME PRIVACY?
- SURE.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.993
MR. AND MRS. THORNE,
COME WITH ME.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.032
- DON'T!

31:06.065 --> 31:08.100
- YOU'RE A VERY POPULAR
YOUNG MAN, YOU KNOW THAT?

31:08.134 --> 31:09.301
- PLEASE DON'T...

31:09.335 --> 31:12.471
- YOU'RE THE MOST POPULAR GUEST
WE EVER HAD.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.174
- JOCELYN.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.211
IT'S TEDDY.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.380
- I KNOW.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.082
WHY IS HE HERE?

31:23.115 --> 31:25.051
- WE KNEW THIS WOULDN'T BE EASY
FOR YOU.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.119
WE WERE JUST HOPING THAT
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER

31:27.153 --> 31:28.921
MIGHT BE ABLE
TO REMEMBER SOMETHING.

31:28.955 --> 31:31.490
- COMING HERE WAS A MISTAKE.
- I'M SO SORRY.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.993
- DOESN'T MATTER.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.064
MY MIND, IT WAS--

31:39.698 --> 31:41.968
IT WAS FLOATING
ON THE CEILING.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.307
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING,
ANYWAY.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.042
- I DO.

31:53.045 --> 31:55.982
WE USED TO TALK

31:56.015 --> 31:59.018
WHEN THEY LEFT US ALONE.

31:59.051 --> 32:00.987
I-I CALLED YOU MOUSE...
- [sobs]

32:01.020 --> 32:05.591
- 'CAUSE YOU WERE SO SMALL
AND SO SCARED.

32:10.696 --> 32:14.266
I HAD A PACK OF TWINKIES ONCE,

32:14.300 --> 32:16.002
AND I GAVE YOU ONE.

32:16.035 --> 32:19.071
- NO, YOU--

32:19.105 --> 32:20.939
YOU GAVE ME BOTH.

32:25.511 --> 32:29.215
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.450
WHY DID YOU DO THAT TO ME?

32:40.026 --> 32:43.629
- IT WAS BETTER
IF IT WAS ME...

32:49.035 --> 32:51.303
AND NOT SOMEBODY ELSE.

33:00.079 --> 33:04.016
- JOCELYN, CAN YOU--CAN YOU
PLEASE TAKE A LOOK?

33:12.624 --> 33:14.426
- THAT ROOM LOOK FAMILIAR?

33:14.460 --> 33:16.428
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
ANYTHING IN IT?

33:16.462 --> 33:18.464
- ANYTHING IS GONNA BE ABLE
TO HELP US.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.432
WE CAN STILL SAVE THIS BOY.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.374
- THAT ROOM.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.042
I WAS THERE.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.777
IT WAS AFTER YOU LEFT.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.380
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE?

33:34.413 --> 33:36.648
- THEY DROVE ME ACROSS A BRIDGE
TO GET THERE.

33:36.682 --> 33:40.619
- UH-HUH.
- A-A LONG BRIDGE.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.621
I WAS BLINDFOLDED,

33:42.654 --> 33:45.291
BUT I REMEMBER THE TIRES
ON METAL.

33:45.324 --> 33:48.327
- WHAT BRIDGE?
GEORGE WASHINGTON? TRIBOROUGH?

33:48.360 --> 33:51.797
- GEORGE TOLD US THAT
THE GUY WHO PICKED UP HENRY

33:51.830 --> 33:54.833
COMPLAINED THAT HE HAD TO PAY
A DOUBLE TOLL TO GET HOME.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.502
- THAT'S RIGHT, $22.50.

33:56.535 --> 34:00.472
- WELL, BATTERY TUNNEL'S $7.50.
VERRAZANO BRIDGE IS $15

34:00.506 --> 34:02.374
GOING WESTBOUND
TO STATEN ISLAND.

34:02.408 --> 34:05.311
THERE'S CHEAPER WAYS TO GET
THERE, BUT THEY TAKE LONGER.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.179
- SO STATEN ISLAND?

34:07.213 --> 34:09.515
- FRIENDS, ONE HOUR TO GO.
- NO!

34:09.548 --> 34:13.785
- AND WE ALREADY HAVE
SOME VERY SPECIAL REQUESTS.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.355
- YOU RECOGNIZE THAT VOICE?
DO YOU REMEMBER THE NAME?

34:16.388 --> 34:19.125
- BOB.
- BOB WHO?

34:19.158 --> 34:19.725
- READY FOR THIS?
- DON'T HURT ME!

34:19.758 --> 34:21.793
- JUST BOB.
- TEDDY?

34:21.827 --> 34:23.495
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

34:23.529 --> 34:26.132
- YOU KNOW HIM.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.802
HE WAS THE ONE
WHO CHAINED ME DOWN FOR YOU.

34:34.140 --> 34:37.443
YOU KNOW.
- LET ME GO!

34:37.476 --> 34:39.878
- TEDDY, YOU TOLD MY SERGEANT
THAT THERE WAS ONE MAN THERE

34:39.911 --> 34:41.447
THAT EVERYBODY WAS SCARED OF.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.282
- NO.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.117
NO, THAT--

34:45.151 --> 34:47.619
THAT GUY,
THAT'S SOMEBODY ELSE.

34:47.653 --> 34:49.821
UH...

34:49.855 --> 34:53.692
BOB--BOB WAS JUST A PIG.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.361
TOWARD THE END,
HE MADE ME GO OUT

34:55.394 --> 34:57.129
AND--AND GET HIS CHINESE FOOD.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.131
- OKAY, DO YOU REMEMBER
THE LAST NAME ON THE ORDERS?

35:00.499 --> 35:03.135
- I-I, UH--LIKE THE NAME
OF A PRESIDENT.

35:03.169 --> 35:06.238
- LIKE BUSH OR REAGAN?

35:06.272 --> 35:08.607
- THE ONE WITH THE--
WITH THE TRUMPET.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.842
- SAXOPHONE.
- CLINTON.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.744
- YEAH.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.847
- OKAY, CROSS-REFERENCE
BOB CLINTONS IN STATEN ISLAND

35:15.881 --> 35:19.151
WITH ANY OWNERS OF GRAY SUVS.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.289
- ROLLINS, THE DMV ADDRESS
WAS OUT OF DATE.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.324
NEIGHBOR SAID HE MOVED
SOMEWHERE ACROSS ARMSTRONG.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.226
- COPY THAT. ALL RIGHT, I'LL--
I'LL CHECK UTILITY BILLS.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.527
AND I'M RUNNING HIS TAG NUMBER

35:28.560 --> 35:29.828
THROUGH THE PLATE READER
DATABASE

35:29.861 --> 35:31.697
TO SEE WHERE IT'S BEEN
PICKED UP LATELY.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.799
- TARU'S STILL SEARCHING THROUGH
STATEN ISLAND IPS.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.801
THE FEED'S RUNNING AGAIN.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.903
- A MEMBER FROM CANADA
WANTS TO SEE MORE OF YOU.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.905
TURN AROUND FOR HIM, HENRY.
- I DON'T WANT TO.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.907
- I SAID TURN AROUND!

35:46.212 --> 35:48.947
- WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY?
[computer beeps]

35:48.980 --> 35:51.383
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I MAY HAVE SOMETHING HERE.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.752
GET BENSON AND VOIGHT
SOUTH TO ELTINGVILLE.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.826
- [breathing shakily]

36:00.859 --> 36:02.828
NO.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.863
NO!

36:04.896 --> 36:08.300
- SIT ON THE BED NOW, HENRY.
- NO!

36:08.334 --> 36:09.935
PLEASE, JUST LET ME GO.

36:09.968 --> 36:12.338
- DEAR LORD.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.376
- FREEZE! TURN AROUND!
GET YOUR HANDS UP!

36:17.409 --> 36:20.679
GET YOUR ASS DOWN!
GET YOUR ASS DOWN!

36:20.712 --> 36:21.880
GET ON THE FLOOR!

36:21.913 --> 36:25.851
GET YOUR ASS DOWN!

36:25.884 --> 36:26.785
- I GOT TWO MORE.
WHO'S GOT EYES?

36:26.818 --> 36:28.654
- THEY LOOK FORWARD
TO MEETING YOU, BOB.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.523
- HENRY.
HENRY, YOU'RE OKAY.

36:31.557 --> 36:32.924
- [groans]

36:36.962 --> 36:39.231
- HEY, YOU! POLICE! STOP!
PUT YOUR HANDS UP NOW!

36:39.265 --> 36:40.566
- HEY. HEY! I GOT HIM!

36:40.599 --> 36:42.501
both: [groan]

36:42.534 --> 36:45.003
- SETTLE DOWN.
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.972
- LISTEN TO ME, IT'S OVER.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.677
- I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

36:51.710 --> 36:55.747
- I KNOW. I KNOW THAT.
IT'S OKAY.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.849
COME ON, SWEETIE.
COME ON.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.386
COME ON.

37:09.695 --> 37:09.895
.

37:09.928 --> 37:10.596
- THREE PIECES OF CRAP
DELIVERED.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.433
- NICE WORK. WHO ARE
THESE OTHER TWO WITH CLINTON?

37:14.466 --> 37:16.402
- TECH SUPPORT.
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

37:16.435 --> 37:17.669
- YOU BELIEVE 'EM?

37:17.703 --> 37:19.605
- WELL, THE WAY THEY WERE CRYING
IN THE CAR...

37:19.638 --> 37:21.573
- IF THEY HAD ANYTHING TO OFFER,
THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT UP.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.609
- GUYS, WE GOT A PROBLEM.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.916
- "TUNE IN TOMORROW."
THEY'RE STILL IN BUSINESS.

37:30.949 --> 37:32.384
- FROM GOD KNOWS WHERE.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.553
- WE GOT THAT PRICK,

37:34.586 --> 37:36.522
BUT WE STILL DON'T HAVE
THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.290
- OKAY, OKAY.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.926
TEDDY SAID THAT THERE WAS A GUY
THAT EVERYBODY WAS AFRAID OF.

37:40.959 --> 37:44.530
LET'S SEE IF CLINTON
WILL GIVE HIM UP.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.598
- KIDNAPPING.
ATTEMPTED RAPE.

37:46.632 --> 37:49.468
FEDERAL CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
CHARGES.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.505
LOOKIN' AT ABOUT 800 YEARS.

37:53.539 --> 37:54.973
- KID CAME WITH ME VOLUNTARILY
AND NOTHING HAPPENED.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.509
- YEAH, AND IF WE'D GOTTEN THERE
FIVE MINUTES LATER?

37:57.543 --> 37:58.910
- I'D HAVE BEEN FEEDING HIM
MILK AND COOKIES.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.646
- DON'T EVEN TRY.
WE SAW THE FIRST LITTLE SHOW

38:00.679 --> 38:02.748
THAT YOU DID WITH THAT KID.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.683
- YOU GOT ONE CHANCE
OF GETTING OUT OF HERE.

38:04.716 --> 38:07.453
WHO'S YOUR BOSS?
WHERE'S THE OTHER GIRL?

38:07.486 --> 38:09.421
- [laughs]

38:09.455 --> 38:11.723
YOU DON'T KNOW?

38:14.059 --> 38:16.462
GET A D.A. DOWN HERE.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.565
I KNOW THINGS,

38:19.598 --> 38:20.966
PEOPLE.
[laughs]

38:20.999 --> 38:23.669
YOU'LL NEVER FIND OUT
WITHOUT MY HELP.

38:25.937 --> 38:29.475
JUST WANT ONE THING--
FULL IMMUNITY.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.878
I WALK.
- YOU WALK?

38:32.911 --> 38:36.515
HOW ABOUT I BUY YOU A MERCEDES
SO YOU CAN DRIVE OUT OF HERE?

38:36.548 --> 38:37.883
- FULL IMMUNITY.

38:37.916 --> 38:41.887
- AND THE NEXT KID
THAT GOES LIVE ONLINE,

38:41.920 --> 38:45.357
YOU LOSE ANY TINY LEVERAGE
THAT YOU THINK YOU HAVE.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.825
- IF IT WERE TINY,

38:46.858 --> 38:49.661
WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING
THIS LOVELY CONVERSATION.

38:49.695 --> 38:50.996
- BENSON.

38:51.029 --> 38:54.700
- WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.937
IN THE MEANWHILE, I'M GONNA
SEND YOU TO THE TOMBS

38:58.970 --> 39:02.608
AND LET YOU THINK ABOUT
YOUR OPTIONS.

39:02.641 --> 39:05.744
PEOPLE GET A LOT
OF CLARITY THERE.

39:14.620 --> 39:17.088
- SO I FOLLOWED UP
WITH CHILD SERVICES.

39:17.122 --> 39:19.591
THEY LOCATED
HENRY'S ACTUAL PARENTS.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.092
- HOW IS HE?

39:21.126 --> 39:23.495
- HE'S OKAY,
CONSIDERING.

39:23.529 --> 39:26.164
- JOCELYN WENT BACK TO SCHOOL
THIS MORNING.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.734
SHE MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR
SHE NEVER WANTS TO SEE US AGAIN.

39:28.767 --> 39:31.537
OR YOU.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.838
- WHERE'S TEDDY?

39:32.871 --> 39:34.640
- HE SPENT THE NIGHT
IN THE BREAK ROOM.

39:34.673 --> 39:35.641
IT'S LIKE HE HASN'T SLEPT
IN YEARS.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.142
- SO WAKE HIM UP.

39:37.175 --> 39:38.910
SEE IF HE CAN PICK CLINTON
OUT OF A PHOTO ARRAY.

39:38.944 --> 39:42.080
- YEAH.
- EXCUSE ME. HEY.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.516
- SERGEANT.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.752
- HALSTEAD'S ON HIS WAY
BACK TO CHICAGO.

39:46.785 --> 39:49.755
OLIVIA,
I'D LIKE TO STICK AROUND,

39:49.788 --> 39:51.757
SEE IF I CAN TURN CLINTON.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.892
- THE D.A. WILL BE HERE
IN AN HOUR.

39:53.925 --> 39:54.893
WE'LL REVIEW OPTIONS.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.128
- I'D LIKE A CRACK AT HIM FIRST.

39:57.162 --> 40:00.566
- WHOA.
[telephone rings]

40:00.599 --> 40:03.969
BENSON.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.505
WHEN?

40:06.538 --> 40:10.609
OKAY.

40:10.642 --> 40:13.479
THAT WAS THE TOMBS.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.747
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
BEAT YOU TO IT.

40:17.883 --> 40:20.886
- YOU CALL THIS
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY?

40:20.919 --> 40:22.754
- THE C.O. STEPPED AWAY
FOR TWO MINUTES.

40:22.788 --> 40:25.156
WHEN HE CAME BACK,
CLINTON HAD A SHIV IN HIS NECK.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.058
DEAD RIGHT THERE.
- YOU GET THE GUY WHO DID THIS?

40:27.092 --> 40:30.629
- LESTER DAVIS.
AWAITING TRIAL ON ARMED ROBBERY.

40:30.662 --> 40:33.599
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE'RE GONNA
NEED DAVIS' CALL LOGS,

40:33.632 --> 40:37.603
HIS VISITOR LOGS, AND LET'S GO
SEE HIS CELL. NOW.

40:40.238 --> 40:42.674
- SO LESTER DAVIS GOT ONE CALL
THIS MORNING?

40:42.708 --> 40:44.910
- YEAH. AND AN HOUR LATER
HE SHANKS CLINTON.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.045
- ANY LUCK TRACING THE CALL?

40:47.078 --> 40:49.214
- IT'S FROM A THROWAWAY CELL.
- THAT WAS TARU.

40:49.247 --> 40:52.083
ALL THEY COULD CONFIRM
IS THAT IT WAS SOLD IN CHICAGO.

40:52.117 --> 40:55.186
- GREAT. FANTASTIC.
[cell phone buzzes]

40:55.220 --> 40:56.855
- VOIGHT.

40:56.888 --> 40:59.190
- IT'S LINDSAY.
- YOU HOME IN BED?

40:59.224 --> 41:01.727
- NO. I'VE GOT BAD NEWS.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.762
ANDREW LEWELLEN
AND THE COP GUARDING HIM

41:03.795 --> 41:06.064
WERE BOTH JUST SHOT TO DEATH
20 MINUTES AGO.

41:12.037 --> 41:14.906
- WHAT?

41:14.940 --> 41:18.677
- THE FIRE VIC WHO HAD THE
PICTURES THAT STARTED ALL THIS,

41:18.710 --> 41:20.612
AND ONE OF OUR OWN--

41:20.646 --> 41:22.080
MURDERED.

41:27.285 --> 41:29.655
- THAT SNAKE HEAD--

41:29.688 --> 41:32.090
THAT'S IN CHICAGO.

41:36.194 --> 41:37.863
- I'M COMING HOME.
