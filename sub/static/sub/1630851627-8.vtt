00:32.532 --> 00:34.159
[whirring and whooshing sounds]

00:34.826 --> 00:35.744
[Richard] Niko.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.328
Richard.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.705
They aren't Achaia.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.708
[gasping] Wh-- what the fuck are they?

00:41.791 --> 00:43.251
I don't know. I don't know.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.838
-[intense humming]
-[screams]

00:46.921 --> 00:49.299
-[crackling]

00:50.842 --> 00:52.427
-[low, intense buzzing]
-Richard!

00:54.095 --> 00:55.680
-[screams]
-Richard!

00:56.181 --> 00:57.682
No!

00:59.184 --> 01:01.144
Richard! Richard!

01:01.227 --> 01:03.146
No! Stop!

01:12.572 --> 01:13.406
[rapid heartbeat]

01:13.490 --> 01:15.075
[fizzing and crackling]

01:21.831 --> 01:23.374
[sounds stop]

01:29.631 --> 01:30.882
[rasping breaths]

01:30.965 --> 01:32.967
[heartbeat slowing]

01:35.011 --> 01:36.679
[steady bleeping]

01:43.645 --> 01:45.480
-[energy surges]
-[low humming]

01:46.564 --> 01:48.274
-Richard, wake up!
-[thump]

01:49.984 --> 01:50.860
Richard!

01:51.778 --> 01:52.946
Richard, wake up!

01:54.072 --> 01:55.323
[sobbing] Richard!

01:56.908 --> 01:58.159
[thump]

01:58.243 --> 01:59.577
No. No. No.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.291
No. No! No!

02:27.272 --> 02:29.524
[Richard gasps and groans]

02:33.236 --> 02:34.988
[both gasping]

02:40.201 --> 02:41.661
[Richard shivering]

02:42.787 --> 02:43.663
Are you okay?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.540
[whispers] I think so.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.001
[low, pulsating hum]

02:49.711 --> 02:52.922
-What do you think these bands do?
-Nothing good.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.843
[Niko grunts]

02:58.386 --> 02:59.888
[pulsating whirring continues]

03:13.443 --> 03:15.445
There's no trace of what happened.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.369
Nothing. No scars.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.915
Last thing I remember,
they dropped the temperature,

03:26.998 --> 03:28.917
and I felt like I was freezing to death.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.461
And there was this thick, viscous fluid.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.131
We were drowning in it.
Like, it covered us entirely.

03:35.757 --> 03:36.591
And now…

03:37.091 --> 03:38.009
We're here.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.136
Healthier than ever.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.847
Uh…

03:44.807 --> 03:45.725
What's that?

03:49.145 --> 03:51.022
[rapid bleeping]

03:52.565 --> 03:54.400
[high-pitched buzzing]

03:56.444 --> 03:57.737
[rapid bleeping continues]

03:57.820 --> 03:59.822
[rasping breathing]

04:03.868 --> 04:06.537
-Cameras.
-They're watching us.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.373
We need to--

04:08.456 --> 04:10.333
-[intense electric buzzing]
-[screams]

04:12.377 --> 04:14.420
-Niko? You okay?
-[buzzing stops]

04:14.504 --> 04:17.465
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-[Richard gasps]

04:17.548 --> 04:19.300
[whooshing]

04:22.679 --> 04:26.057
They've observed our physical reactions
to various stimuli,

04:26.140 --> 04:28.142
our physiological composition, and…

04:29.102 --> 04:31.271
they punish us
if we don't follow the rules.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.147
So what, this is like some fucked-up test?

04:33.231 --> 04:34.857
[whooshing]

04:35.900 --> 04:39.195
Something tells me
the next phase lies beyond that door.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.990
The Salvare was marooned in deep space,

04:42.073 --> 04:44.492
which means that this ship
is also FTL-capable.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.412
I'd like to know a bit more
about these creatures

04:47.495 --> 04:48.830
before we try and mutiny.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.042
We know they're highly organized
and technologically advanced.

04:53.126 --> 04:53.960
[Richard] Cruel.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.254
[Niko] Yeah. That too.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.840
[whooshing]

04:58.923 --> 05:00.174
[door closes]

05:02.552 --> 05:03.553
Still being watched.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.722
[rasping breathing]

05:05.805 --> 05:06.806
[buzzing]

05:06.889 --> 05:08.725
[rapid whirring]

05:09.309 --> 05:11.311
[whooshing]

05:12.812 --> 05:13.855
Do we follow?

05:14.939 --> 05:16.149
Do we have a choice?

05:25.116 --> 05:26.534
[ringing sound]

05:27.994 --> 05:30.413
-What is it?
-Thought I heard something.

05:31.622 --> 05:32.623
[Niko] Should we stop?

05:32.707 --> 05:34.042
-[splat]
-[hissing]

05:34.125 --> 05:36.544
-[intense whirring vibrations]
-[screams and gasps]

05:36.627 --> 05:38.963
[both yelling]

05:40.340 --> 05:41.841
-[vibrations stop]
-I think that's a no.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.760
[breathing shakily] Okay…

05:43.843 --> 05:47.597
We have to find their weaknesses
so we can use them to our advantage.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.515
We've yet to see one.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.435
Mm-mm. During the torture,

05:53.603 --> 05:54.687
I got a look.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.397
Bipedal.

05:56.898 --> 06:00.735
The hallways and surveillance methods also
suggest they're sight-based creatures.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.362
Unlike the Achaia,

06:03.112 --> 06:04.113
they have bodies.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.658
Bodies we can injure.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.370
[Richard] Bodies we can kill.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.538
Fuck this "first contact" bullshit.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.792
"To know your enemy,
you must become your enemy."

06:15.875 --> 06:18.252
So, yes, fuck first contact.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.382
[whooshing]

06:22.465 --> 06:23.758
[door closes]

06:30.556 --> 06:32.767
-Do you hear that?
-[whooshing]

06:32.850 --> 06:34.060
[door closes]

06:34.143 --> 06:36.437
Richard! Richard!

06:38.898 --> 06:39.732
Niko.

06:40.775 --> 06:41.734
Richard!

06:43.111 --> 06:43.986
Niko!

06:44.070 --> 06:45.405
Niko, can you hear me?

06:47.156 --> 06:48.074
[whirring]

06:57.875 --> 06:59.710
Wait. Just mind-wiped?

06:59.794 --> 07:02.630
Look, I remember the magnetar.
I remember operating on Javier.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.298
Remember why you were operating?

07:04.382 --> 07:07.051
What happened to the Achaian ring
Niko and Cas were on?

07:08.010 --> 07:11.222
Listen, I know it's hard to believe,
but you were, all of you--

07:11.305 --> 07:12.140
Violated.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.810
With surgical precision. [scoffs]

07:16.436 --> 07:18.020
Seth went into our brains and took out

07:18.104 --> 07:21.023
-just enough that we wouldn't notice.
-How would Seth know where to look?

07:21.107 --> 07:23.151
There are tens of billions of neurons
in our brains.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.694
One of you must have told him.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.321
-Bullshit.
-Look, the Achaia are manipulative.

07:27.822 --> 07:31.951
They-- they exploit vulnerabilities.
They use deception to force their will.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.162
Or make us an offer we can't refuse.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.248
My mother, she was sick.

07:37.999 --> 07:38.833
Dying.

07:39.959 --> 07:40.918
But now she's better.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.045
No. You wouldn't do that.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.630
An offer to save her life?

07:45.214 --> 07:47.592
I mean, if that was put on the table,
I might.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.181
-I'm sorry.
-[Dillon] Don't be.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.891
Death fucks with everybody.

07:55.558 --> 07:59.854
If it meant saving someone that I loved,
I don't know what I'd do either.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.857
[Cas] When I was on that ring,

08:04.150 --> 08:06.527
the Achaia offered me
something I really wanted.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.488
So I get it, Zayn.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.407
I do. It's okay.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.870
Look, we just have to remember
that no matter what gifts they offer,

08:16.370 --> 08:18.789
these creatures are capable
of wiping out entire planets.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.876
Yes. But they're repairing ours.

08:21.959 --> 08:25.755
-Curing sick moms, daughters.
-So? Niko gave us clear orders.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.465
-Yes. But Niko's dead.
-[Erik] Yeah.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.383
So you could be here.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.887
I know. You're right, okay?
I'm sorry. It's just--

08:34.013 --> 08:35.348
What if Earth is different?

08:35.431 --> 08:38.267
Or they're just playing nice
until they go all apocalyptic?

08:38.351 --> 08:41.103
Look, we fought them in space,
we know what they're all about,

08:41.187 --> 08:43.773
we're the only ones that can get
ahead of them before it's too late.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.317
Get ahead how? We can't remember anything.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.318
[Cas] No, we can't.

08:48.736 --> 08:49.695
But William can.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.615
If we know that, then Seth knows that too.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.201
Which is why
we gotta get to William first.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.582
[instruments bleeping]

09:03.584 --> 09:05.253
[whirring]

09:10.675 --> 09:12.677
[William] Come on, Erik. Pick up.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.095
[beeps]

09:15.429 --> 09:16.389
[sighs]

09:19.433 --> 09:22.019
Cas. Come on, Cas. I need you now, mate.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.604
Come on, Cas. I need you.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.231
[beeps]

09:25.314 --> 09:26.816
[whirring]

09:26.899 --> 09:28.442
[grunts]

09:34.991 --> 09:36.450
The Phantom of the Salvare,

09:36.534 --> 09:38.703
-doomed to haunt the halls forever.
-That was you?

09:38.786 --> 09:41.539
Technically her,
following my orders to hack your coding.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.749
-Why?
-Can you give us a minute?

09:46.627 --> 09:48.045
-[Seth] You know who I am?
-Yes.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.965
You know what I want?
Unfortunately, it's encrypted.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.301
Locked up, squirreled away.

09:53.384 --> 09:56.554
And since I can't physically rummage
through your brain to delete it,

09:56.637 --> 09:59.181
it's just… in there,

09:59.265 --> 10:01.017
like a bomb waitin' to take us out.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.020
-You're not Achaian.
-No. But the thing in my head is.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.980
And so is the future of my species.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.442
Oh, and so is a tiny part of you. Right?

10:09.525 --> 10:13.070
Half of Iara?
Also locked up, also squirreled away.

10:13.154 --> 10:16.407
-Cas was gonna--
-Not here. Like Niko's not here.

10:16.949 --> 10:20.286
I'm the senior USIC rep. If I ordered it,
you'd have to fly into the sun.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.624
The Salvare encountered a magnetar.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.584
You saw what happened

10:26.667 --> 10:29.211
when high-density neutrinos
and Achaian matter meet.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.297
You saw a ring get dusted,

10:31.380 --> 10:34.425
and now you're lookin'
for a back-pocket plan B.

10:34.508 --> 10:37.053
You're thinkin' "Can I duplicate it here?"

10:37.803 --> 10:39.597
"Can I turn it into a weapon?"

10:41.724 --> 10:44.226
-I miss anything?
-My instructions are explicit.

10:46.896 --> 10:47.772
So are mine.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.858
Can't say I didn't ask nicely.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.656
[thump]

10:56.739 --> 10:57.657
Richard!

11:01.911 --> 11:02.745
Richard.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.423
Right-hand rule.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.094
Let's hope they don't know maze theory.

11:24.475 --> 11:25.559
Niko!

11:28.437 --> 11:29.647
-[whooshing]
-[thump]

11:30.439 --> 11:31.440
[sighs] Come on.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.526
[gasps]

11:40.533 --> 11:42.034
Richard, where are you?

11:49.041 --> 11:49.959
Right is right.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.879
-[rasping breathing]
-[static fizzing]

11:54.588 --> 11:55.548
Niko!

11:56.674 --> 11:58.050
If you can hear me…

11:58.968 --> 12:00.302
-[whooshing]
-[thump]

12:01.470 --> 12:02.346
Shit.

12:07.601 --> 12:08.686
Niko!

12:09.854 --> 12:10.730
Niko.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.023
[rasping breath]

12:13.858 --> 12:15.151
Fuck!

12:19.613 --> 12:21.449
This is some bullshit.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.622
Left. Right.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.585
Right, back round again.

12:35.713 --> 12:36.756
Fuck!

12:36.839 --> 12:38.841
-[intense buzzing]
-[screams]

12:48.184 --> 12:49.351
[door thumps]

13:02.198 --> 13:03.657
[groaning]

13:08.037 --> 13:09.580
[panting]

13:18.714 --> 13:20.216
[crackling]

13:22.384 --> 13:23.844
[whirring]

13:23.928 --> 13:25.930
[ringing]

13:31.519 --> 13:32.853
[gasps]

13:33.813 --> 13:35.189
[groans]

13:43.280 --> 13:45.032
[electric humming]

13:49.328 --> 13:50.454
Found you.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.415
What took you so long?

13:53.499 --> 13:55.876
Turns out I'm not as good at puzzles
as I thought.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.589
What does it mean?

14:01.340 --> 14:03.092
Your guess is as good as mine.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.887
Do you feel different?
Like weak or anything?

14:06.971 --> 14:07.805
Nothing.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.433
They led us here.

14:12.059 --> 14:12.893
Why?

14:14.270 --> 14:16.981
When I approached this,
my armband turned blue.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.484
When I touched it,
I had images in my head.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.652
Flashes of things.

14:23.821 --> 14:24.780
Anything?

14:24.864 --> 14:25.739
Nothing.

14:27.783 --> 14:30.786
-What did you see?
-A star map, uh, a planet.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.455
Ship just like this one.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.249
And this was highlighted.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.668
And it was green,
more vibrant than this one.

14:37.751 --> 14:39.461
This energy core might be depleted.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.883
What now?

14:43.966 --> 14:45.342
[whirring sounds]

14:45.843 --> 14:46.677
Richard.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.347
-[intense crackling]
-[screams]

14:50.431 --> 14:51.849
-Richard.
-[yells]

14:52.683 --> 14:54.268
-[crackling subsides]
-[yells] I'm fine.

14:54.351 --> 14:56.353
-[whirring]
-[Richard groans]

14:57.521 --> 14:59.398

15:18.584 --> 15:19.793

15:19.877 --> 15:21.295
[engines roaring]

15:29.595 --> 15:31.597
[loud thumping]

15:35.017 --> 15:36.894

15:36.977 --> 15:38.979

15:44.026 --> 15:46.028
[wind whistling]

16:30.781 --> 16:32.783
[shivering]

16:36.870 --> 16:38.872

16:39.665 --> 16:41.000
[clicking and buzzing]

17:10.654 --> 17:12.197

17:16.201 --> 17:18.287
[clanking and scraping sounds]

17:52.362 --> 17:54.281

-[whirrs]

17:54.907 --> 17:55.741

18:43.455 --> 18:44.331

18:44.414 --> 18:46.041
[power fading]

18:49.002 --> 18:50.003
[woman gasps]

18:51.296 --> 18:52.548
[woman panting]

18:56.802 --> 18:58.053
[woman grunts]

19:05.435 --> 19:06.311
Paula.

19:06.854 --> 19:07.688
Jesus.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.189
[gasps] Niko.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.692
How did you get here?

19:11.775 --> 19:13.694
Is the Salvare ba--

19:13.777 --> 19:14.862
[Niko] Back on Earth.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.780
Half of it, anyway.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.532
Richard and I stayed behind.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.285
-Then those creatures--
-The Decuma.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.453
Is that what they're called?

19:24.371 --> 19:26.206
Yeah. I took this off a dead one.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.958
That wasn't a Decuma.

19:28.792 --> 19:29.960
They don't wear anything.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.462
So it was something else.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.174
That the Decuma caught,
tortured, and killed.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.134
Like the rest of us.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.929
Where are the other colonists?

19:41.513 --> 19:44.141
This ship landed
maybe a week after you left.

19:44.808 --> 19:45.893
We tried to fight.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.020
Most got slaughtered.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.814
They took the survivors back here.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.067
I think I'm the last… one.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.528
-[screams]
-No. Okay. Okay.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.948
I can save you.
I have one of their shuttles.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.783
I'm not going anywhere.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.621
Then I will fix this ship and use it to
attack the other ship and rescue Richard--

20:05.704 --> 20:07.039
-You can't.
-Why?

20:07.122 --> 20:11.001
Because you need a Decuma bio-scan
to unlock their systems.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.213
-[gasps]
-What is happening to you?

20:16.131 --> 20:18.091
Is this one of their experiments?

20:18.675 --> 20:20.594
There were a lot of experiments.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.721
Not everyone survived them.

20:23.764 --> 20:28.310
Or we'd be taken to the point of death,
and then revived and do it all over again.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.228
Us too.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.522
But when this thing turns red,

20:33.774 --> 20:35.859
you start to turn into one of them.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.111
What?

20:39.696 --> 20:41.031
No, no. Are you sure?

20:41.865 --> 20:43.617
Yeah. Pretty fucking sure.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.868
How do you stop it?

20:45.452 --> 20:49.373
If you could get it off you,
it might stop the transition.

20:52.918 --> 20:56.046
You were sent
to retrieve their energy core.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.341
It's what the Decuma use
to power their ships,

20:59.424 --> 21:01.093
and they're in short supply.

21:01.718 --> 21:04.930
They kill each other over them.
That's how this ship ended up here.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.726
And now you're down here because
they couldn't retrieve it themselves.

21:09.810 --> 21:10.811
Why?

21:13.814 --> 21:17.526
[gasps] The cold crystallizes their blood.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.697
That's what I saw in the corridor.
I saw one.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.074
We couldn't kill it.
But the cold sure did.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.577
-The cold. That's all it takes?
-That's what's killing me.

21:30.497 --> 21:34.710
Niko, I'm sorry about what happened before

21:34.793 --> 21:37.129
-with Cas and the colony…
-Hey, it's fine.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.797
-It's fine.
-It's not.

21:40.799 --> 21:41.800
I failed.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.887
Cas… Is she--

21:45.971 --> 21:47.973
As far as I know,
she's back on Earth, safe.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.474
[gasps]

21:55.772 --> 21:56.982
-I have to--
-I know.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.943
[metal clanking]

22:06.199 --> 22:09.036
Don't let me turn into one of them, Niko.
Please.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.168
[Paula sobbing]

22:36.855 --> 22:38.857
[metal creaking]

22:40.650 --> 22:42.652
[instruments clicking and buzzing]

22:52.829 --> 22:53.955

23:35.664 --> 23:36.832
[exhales]

23:36.915 --> 23:38.166
Let's see what else you do.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.132
[crackling]

24:18.665 --> 24:19.958
[clicking]

24:26.089 --> 24:27.174
[gasps]

24:39.853 --> 24:41.021
[grunts]

24:42.272 --> 24:46.151
-Uh, no, thanks.
-No? You sure? It's sparkling rambutan.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.157
Listen. You can't beat yourself up.

24:52.949 --> 24:54.201
I failed, Bernie.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.954
I put the fate of the entire world
at risk.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.915
Yeah, yeah, to save your mom.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.124
It's not an excuse.

25:02.083 --> 25:05.462
Niko and Cas, they were tempted,
but they-- they didn't give in.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.005
But I did.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.426
I judged Sasha so harshly, and…

25:12.761 --> 25:16.348
-it turns out I'm just as weak as he was.
-No, no, no, no. Okay? No.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.391
You're just as human.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.312
Right? And no matter what
the Achaia might want us to think,

25:22.812 --> 25:24.564
that's never a bad thing.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.485
[alarm siren blaring]

25:34.449 --> 25:36.201
Guys, it's USIC. We gotta go.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.052
What, we're fugitives now?
What did we even do?

25:54.135 --> 25:55.512
You talked to me.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.138
What? We have laws.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.266
I saw Seth kill a woman
in front of my eyes.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.851
I saw USIC annihilate the rest of them.

26:02.352 --> 26:05.063
Nothing's gonna stop Seth or them
from gettin' what they want.

26:05.146 --> 26:09.067
-Yeah, well, what the fuck do they want?
-We need William. Can we download him?

26:09.150 --> 26:13.113
Even if we could, I don't know anyone who
has that storage capacity besides USIC.

26:13.196 --> 26:16.449
I could reach out to my contacts. There
were underground data storage facilities

26:16.533 --> 26:18.118
-in my Water City--
-A supply shuttle.

26:18.702 --> 26:19.744
-What?
-Okay, look.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.539
USIC sends supply shuttles to the Salvare
every day to recommission it.

26:22.622 --> 26:26.751
-What if we can get Erik and Cas in there?
-[Cas] Bernie, USIC is already on to us.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.045
Unless we send someone else
up there instead.

26:40.557 --> 26:41.891

26:46.062 --> 26:47.731
-[door thumps]
-[groans]

26:49.232 --> 26:50.150
I have it.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.109
[device chirps]

26:51.610 --> 26:52.569
So, what now?

26:53.320 --> 26:54.154
[Richard] Niko.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.406
Richard?

26:57.407 --> 26:59.409
-Richard.
-[whispers] Here. Over-- over here.

26:59.492 --> 27:00.368
Over here.

27:03.246 --> 27:04.914
[Richard gasping]

27:07.751 --> 27:09.836
I saw Paula on the crashed ship.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.465
-From the colony?
-The Decuma got them too.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.385
She was turning into one of them.

27:19.387 --> 27:20.263
Huh.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.850
I knew this wasn't just a bad rash.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.645
Forget about me.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.648
You still have a chance. You--

27:30.315 --> 27:33.151
You got what they want.
Maybe they'll let you go.

27:33.234 --> 27:34.069
No.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.280
No. If this is it, if you're gonna die,

27:38.865 --> 27:40.116
we're dying together.

27:45.955 --> 27:46.831
Give me your arm.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.626
-Come on.
-[groans]

27:51.252 --> 27:52.921
-[crackling]
-[screams]

27:55.256 --> 27:56.591
-[Richard grunts]
-[screams]

27:57.217 --> 27:58.843
[panting]

28:00.845 --> 28:02.806
Grab the power core.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.145
-Take my arm.
-I'm fine. I'll keep up.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.438
All right. Stay close.

28:17.904 --> 28:21.491
-[Richard groaning]
-Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.662
[gasps]

28:26.913 --> 28:28.164
[thump]

28:29.916 --> 28:30.834
We're trapped.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.336
Richard, stand back.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.963
We're taking a shortcut.

28:38.925 --> 28:39.926
[grunts]

28:42.554 --> 28:45.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.
What are we doing back in here?

28:45.724 --> 28:47.434
-[grunts]
-What's the plan?

28:47.517 --> 28:50.228
The Decuma bio-scan
activates the ship's systems.

28:50.311 --> 28:53.398
-[whirring]
-You see this symbol?

28:54.691 --> 28:57.277
When I tell you,
press that and hold it until I say stop.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.612
Give me the power core. You get ready.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.366
Come and get it.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.327
I will smash this.

29:06.828 --> 29:09.831
I'm pretty sure it'll kill me,
but I'll take you with me.

29:09.914 --> 29:13.001
So stop being a fucking coward
and show yourself.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.210
[rasping breath]

29:17.547 --> 29:19.507
-Get ready.
-Okay. Yeah.

29:23.803 --> 29:26.055
[rasping breathing]

29:29.309 --> 29:30.143
Richard.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.563
[distorted voice] No, don't.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.776
[buzzing, distorted speech]

29:37.859 --> 29:38.985
[gasping]

29:41.279 --> 29:43.198
Richard. Now!

29:46.367 --> 29:47.535
[Decuma screeching]

29:52.957 --> 29:54.417
[coughing]

29:57.337 --> 29:58.630
[Niko coughing]

30:04.677 --> 30:06.846
Hey. Hey. You okay?

30:07.514 --> 30:08.848
[coughs]

30:12.602 --> 30:13.436
I'm fine.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.366
You're not gonna like this next part.

30:26.449 --> 30:27.909
[gasps]

30:29.118 --> 30:30.578
[groans]

30:35.625 --> 30:37.627

30:43.007 --> 30:43.967
Are you ready?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.600

31:17.292 --> 31:19.377
-Name and biometrics.
-Hope Ellison.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.295
Go ahead.

[whirring]

31:21.588 --> 31:23.047
-[high-pitched bleep]
-Good to go.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.343
-John Davis.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.453
-Good to go. Have a good one.
-Yeah.

32:11.846 --> 32:13.848
There he is. William.

32:14.682 --> 32:16.517
Whew! Have I got a surprise for you.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.354
Nothin' to worry about.
Come on, I'll show you.

32:20.021 --> 32:25.109
So I thought about it, and I can't get you
to talk, but I do know somebody who will.

32:25.193 --> 32:29.030
Miss Ursula Monroe, your… mother?

32:31.824 --> 32:33.201
Hello, William.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.081
Hello.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.125
[Niko] Richard.

32:42.835 --> 32:43.753
Richard.

32:45.838 --> 32:46.673
Richard.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.237
[chuckles]

33:10.863 --> 33:11.698
It worked.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.658
It worked.

[whirring]

33:26.170 --> 33:28.172
[distorted ship's voice]

33:32.802 --> 33:33.720
We're here.

33:34.554 --> 33:35.888
Wherever "here" is.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.434
You recognize anything?

33:44.731 --> 33:45.565
Okay.

33:46.441 --> 33:49.485
This area here
looks like the field of dark matter

33:49.569 --> 33:51.362
-that the Salvare encountered.
-Mm-hm.

33:51.446 --> 33:54.115
Which would mean
that this is Pi Canis Majoris.

33:54.657 --> 33:55.867
On the other side…

33:56.868 --> 33:57.785
That's the sun.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.456
And the red markers?

34:02.957 --> 34:04.167
[Niko] I have no idea.

34:05.418 --> 34:06.753
Next question.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.630
How do you fly this thing?

34:27.940 --> 34:29.567
That's as far as she'll go?

34:30.777 --> 34:31.611
No.

34:33.154 --> 34:34.113
No.

34:45.541 --> 34:48.503
I can't take it. I can't do it anymore.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.243
[pulsing buzz]

35:32.964 --> 35:34.632
These are Achaian Artifacts.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.765
This is Zakir, or what used to be Zakir.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.101
So the Decuma were monitoring the Achaia?

35:45.184 --> 35:46.727
Or at least aware of them.

35:47.937 --> 35:48.771
Here.

35:48.855 --> 35:51.190
A few light years away.
We need to go here.

35:51.274 --> 35:54.068
-Go to the Achaia?
-I know it sounds crazy and maybe it is,

35:54.152 --> 35:58.614
but if they can send data
and wedding rings and entire ships,

35:58.698 --> 35:59.949
maybe they can send us.

36:00.783 --> 36:03.077
Look, Richard, we go to the Achaia.

36:03.578 --> 36:07.248
We tell them that I've had
second thoughts. No, no. Hear me out.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.376
And if the offer still stands,
I will be their ambassador.

36:10.459 --> 36:12.420
-Niko.
-Richard.

36:14.046 --> 36:15.631
It's how we get home.
