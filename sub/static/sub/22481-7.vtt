WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:03.337
* No one beside me,
running through your trap *

00:03.371 --> 00:05.039
* Give me everything
that you hiding *

00:05.073 --> 00:07.608
* Headed for your home base,
finna make a close deal *

00:07.641 --> 00:10.511
* If you don't open up the safe,
you gonna feel this cold steel *

00:10.544 --> 00:13.114
* I gotta ball, word around town
is you got it all *

00:13.147 --> 00:16.717
* Set up shop in my hood,
but I never gotta call... *

00:16.750 --> 00:18.086
Let's roll out.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.188
* Stashin' the cash
from your wallet *

00:20.221 --> 00:22.756
* And I'm masked, if you ask me,
homie, I was not involved *

00:22.790 --> 00:24.292
(engine revving)

00:24.325 --> 00:26.327
* And if you retaliate

00:26.360 --> 00:28.762
* Boy, I swear that I'm coming
back for all of y'all *

00:38.639 --> 00:42.610
* Boy, I'll run up in
your trap, trap, trap, trap... *

00:42.643 --> 00:43.777
What's happenin', man?

00:43.811 --> 00:45.346
What's good?

00:45.379 --> 00:48.516
* Boy, I'll run up in
your trap, trap, trap, trap *

00:50.484 --> 00:52.086
* Boy, I'll run
up in your trap *

00:52.120 --> 00:53.321
(silenced gunshots,
men grunting)

00:57.491 --> 00:58.459
* Go.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.428
*

01:12.173 --> 01:14.642
Bad day for
the block, huh?

01:14.675 --> 01:15.643
What's up, Jo-Jo?

01:15.676 --> 01:17.711
Nothing changes nothing.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.247
Here we go again, man.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.150
You stay safe.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.784
How we supposed
to do that, Hondo?

01:23.817 --> 01:25.653
Like, we got to
start putting

01:25.686 --> 01:27.721
our babies to sleep
in a bathtub again?

01:27.755 --> 01:29.323
We're not gonna let anything
pop off, Brey.

01:29.357 --> 01:32.360
You say that.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.328
You hear anything
about the shooters?

01:36.264 --> 01:37.498
Your baby girl's getting big.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.532
And bossy.

01:38.566 --> 01:39.600
Just like her mama.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.569
(laughs)
You know it.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.411
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

01:50.444 --> 01:51.745
Hey, Hondo.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.381
Didn't call for SWAT.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.150
You know I still live
a few blocks from here.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.451
I heard it on
the scanner.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.486
How can I help?

01:58.519 --> 02:00.254
What a mess, huh?

02:00.288 --> 02:01.822
Not your usual
banger drive-by.

02:01.855 --> 02:04.825
Three dead bodies,
all of them 20th Street Hammers.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.627
Precision dropped.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.163
Beautiful work if you like
that kind of thing; it's slick.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.097
You already
beef up patrol?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.632
To protect the Forty-Twos
from retaliation?

02:11.665 --> 02:12.700
Sure we did.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.168
That'll keep a
couple bodies warm

02:14.202 --> 02:15.636
about a minute longer.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.571
But you know what's coming.

02:17.605 --> 02:18.806
The neighborhood's been
peaceful for a while.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.309
There's no such thing
as peace, just...

02:21.342 --> 02:23.444
Temporary cease-fires?

02:23.477 --> 02:24.778
I call that
progress, Norah.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.914
Always the optimist.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.416
You still single?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.819
(laughs)

02:31.852 --> 02:33.587
Nobody's been able
to lock you down?

02:33.621 --> 02:36.324
What about you?
You happy?

02:36.357 --> 02:38.392
Well...

02:38.426 --> 02:39.593
Oh, wait a minute.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.894
Oh, you went
and caught one, huh?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.732
He's a lucky dude.
Do I know him?

02:44.765 --> 02:47.568
Nope. He's blissfully ignorant
of crap like this.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.470
Hey.
Good to see you.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.939
Sorry it had to be
in your own neighborhood.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.282
Yo. You Hondo?

03:01.315 --> 03:03.917
Yeah, I am, little man.
What up?

03:03.951 --> 03:06.920
Leroy needs a sit-down.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.922
Private.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.528
(door buzzes)

03:17.931 --> 03:19.967
Hmm.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.636
Leroy.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.638
Thanks for coming, man.

03:24.672 --> 03:25.839
Yeah.

03:25.873 --> 03:26.840
Been a minute.

03:26.874 --> 03:27.841
Yeah.

03:27.875 --> 03:28.942
What, five years?

03:28.976 --> 03:29.843
More like eight.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.246
Must just feel like five.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.547
Still get the books

03:33.581 --> 03:35.816
every Christmas--
appreciate that.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.619
I know you didn't put out
an S.O.S. 'cause you miss me.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.393
Word is...

03:45.426 --> 03:49.563
my son Darryl might have been
present at that drive-by today.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.265
Up on the corner,
know what I'm saying?

03:51.299 --> 03:52.333
He ain't even
in high school yet.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.001
That didn't stop us
from running around, did it?

03:54.034 --> 03:56.970
Been trying to keep
him all the way out,

03:57.004 --> 03:58.739
but I'm here, I ain't there.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.741
He don't want
my wisdom.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.644
Won't take my calls,
won't come see me.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.779
And the losers
his mama brings home--

04:05.813 --> 04:07.948
waste of oxygen, each one
worse than the last one.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.751
She got no
learning curve.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.753
(sighs)
Me neither, I know.

04:12.786 --> 04:13.987
So if you're
already hearing

04:14.021 --> 04:15.723
that Darryl might have
seen something...

04:15.756 --> 04:17.725
There you go.
You're afraid he's a target.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.561
That, but not
only that.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.796
Hammers don't even know
who hit us today.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.865
And I ain't heard nothing new
about the Forty-Twos.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.834
Darryl's a hothead, though,
like we used to be,

04:26.867 --> 04:28.636
so what's to stop
him and his crew

04:28.669 --> 04:30.838
from going after payback anyhow?

04:30.871 --> 04:33.541
Now, whether they're right
or wrong about the shooters,

04:33.574 --> 04:36.510
either way, he's in trouble, and
I can't get through to the boy.

04:36.544 --> 04:39.380
Okay, hold up, hold up.
What, you think I can?

04:39.413 --> 04:43.784
Hell, just... try and talk
some sense to him, Hondo,

04:43.817 --> 04:45.519
before he ends up dead.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.688
Or makes some other fool dead
for no reason at all.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.760
I know this is a big ask.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.761
No.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.430
No such thing.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.798
Not with our history.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.336
Just...

05:04.605 --> 05:06.073
...keep him alive.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.781
*

05:20.721 --> 05:22.856
It's personal, Jess.
No, I get it.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.358
This jumped off in
my own neighborhood,

05:24.392 --> 05:25.426
four blocks
from the park.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.094
You know the park.
I know the park.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.729
What do you want?
Lend me and Deacon

05:28.762 --> 05:30.631
to Gang-and-Narcotics
for the day.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.133
We'll still be on stand-by
for any SWAT call that comes in.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.370
Hicks doesn't like
sharing talent.

05:36.404 --> 05:39.006
But he's in Palm Springs
until Monday, so...

05:39.039 --> 05:41.141
Hey. It doesn't
have to be official.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.743
But we can get
ahead of this thing,

05:42.776 --> 05:44.044
or we wait for a turf war

05:44.077 --> 05:45.746
that we have to
clean up after anyway.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.847
Okay.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.517
Did you hear about
Luca's grandfather?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.853
You didn't need
to come in today.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.888
Yeah, well, my gramps would've
kicked me around the block

05:54.922 --> 05:56.724
if I stayed home
just 'cause he died.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.159
SWAT always came first.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.395
I'm very sorry
for your loss, Luca.
Thanks.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.096
I mean, he had a
long life, you know?

06:03.130 --> 06:04.498
HONDO:
Still always too soon, man.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.433
I'm sorry.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.435
JESSICA: The department's
putting together

06:07.468 --> 06:08.569
a video for the memorial.

06:08.602 --> 06:09.837
To honor one of our first

06:09.870 --> 06:11.905
team leaders.
CHRIS: O.S.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.040
Original SWAT.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.408
Three generations of Lucas.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.443
Which one is he again?

06:17.511 --> 06:18.912
Always out in front.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.018
I know you were close.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.687
Yeah, we were close.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.788
HONDO:
Hey, Tan.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.723
Deacon and I
got to run on something.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.892
Lot of guys are gonna want
to offer their condolences.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.427
We'll take care of him.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.743
What's up, Darryl?

06:49.777 --> 06:52.045
Yo, y'all here for me?
Look, I ain't do nothing.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.081
You ain't got no cause,
which makes this harassment.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.949
Why? Because I
know your name?

06:55.983 --> 06:56.950
I know yours, too.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.152
Everybody know you around here.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.954
Your pops is worried about you.
He'd like you to get

07:00.988 --> 07:02.055
off the street
until things cool down.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.323
So he called
the cops on me?

07:03.356 --> 07:05.559
Old man trippin'. He thinks I
can't handle myself like he did.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.561
He wants you to know that
it might not have been

07:07.595 --> 07:08.929
the Forty-Twos that
you saw this morning.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.097
I ain't see nothing.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.099
Anybody who says
I was there is lying.
Where were you?

07:12.132 --> 07:13.934
Nowhere.
DEACON: You were somewhere.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.636
That's physics.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.771
Look, I can't be standing here
with you like this.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.206
Folks seeing us.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.775
Well, then you better hurry up
and tell us something, then.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.846
(crowd murmuring)
DARRYL: Hey, am I under arrest?

07:25.879 --> 07:26.847
Am I being detained?
Hey!

07:26.880 --> 07:28.582
Do right by your set.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.050
What kind of car?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.719
What color? How many guys?

07:31.752 --> 07:33.987
Do you have probable cause
to detain me, sir?!

07:34.021 --> 07:35.088
Or am I free to go?!

07:35.122 --> 07:37.124
Hondo.
Am I free to go, sir?!

07:37.157 --> 07:38.726
(crowd continues murmuring)

07:38.759 --> 07:40.594
Your pops is trying
to help you.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.563
Don't disappoint him.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.698
I'm always disappointing him.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.199
Nothing new about that.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.936
Am I free to go? Or are you
violating my rights, sir?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.071
MAN:
Yeah, yeah, we see you.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.774
MAN 2:
You about to go viral...

07:53.807 --> 07:55.576
I'm not detaining you, Darryl.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.048
Glad you don't have kids?

08:01.081 --> 08:04.918
I'm gonna have GND
keep eyes on him.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.588
Come up with a reason
to get that boy off the street.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.892
We lost all our forward gears.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.827
And his grandfather

08:13.861 --> 08:16.897
360s in reverse
and floors it

08:16.930 --> 08:18.966
down the fast lane
of the Hollywood Freeway

08:18.999 --> 08:22.069
with nothing,
nothing but taillights

08:22.102 --> 08:23.804
and a rearview mirror.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.807
And he cut that sucker off
before the Vermont exit.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.910
I thought I was gonna die
before I cleared

08:29.943 --> 08:30.944
my first month in SWAT.

08:30.978 --> 08:31.945
LUCA:
Yeah, we finally had to

08:31.979 --> 08:34.648
take the car keys from him
a few months ago.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.650
Best damn driver
in the department.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.218
(chuckles) If he said so
himself, and he did.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.923
Let me get you
another cup of coffee.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.194
Hey.
Hey.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.796
You okay?
Hmm? Yeah.

08:48.829 --> 08:49.797
STREET:
Luca.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.265
Civilian out in the hall,

08:52.299 --> 08:53.967
she's making the video

08:54.001 --> 08:55.168
for the memorial.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.070
She just wants
to talk to you for a sec.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.740
Gets you away from
the crowd for a bit.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.616
Jilly Clark.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.017
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.218
Thank you.

09:11.251 --> 09:14.187
Your team's been telling me
what a fine officer you are,

09:14.221 --> 09:16.724
and third generation and all
that, and I'd love to just

09:16.757 --> 09:18.025
sit you down, take
ten minutes of your...

09:18.058 --> 09:18.892
No, I'm not interested.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.360
Look, I'm sure
there are plenty of people

09:20.393 --> 09:22.029
who'd be happy
to talk to you about him.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.331
You don't need me, okay?
It was nice meeting you.

09:27.635 --> 09:28.836
He's a private guy.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.604
Oh.

09:30.638 --> 09:31.672
This is, uh, hard for him.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.973
No, I don't blame him.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.975
How about I get
the three of you on camera?

09:35.008 --> 09:37.678
You know, current team members,
changing of the guard.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.012
Jack Luca lived to see

09:39.046 --> 09:41.248
this unit's
50th anniversary,

09:41.281 --> 09:43.917
starting from day one.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.154
Sure. Where do
you want us?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.362
Beating the war drums?

09:55.395 --> 09:56.764
Looks like.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.136
No, hey, Deac.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.271
Just me.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.639
Doesn't take two of us.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.808
Until it does.
Nah, it's cool.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.710
I'm just gonna pay my respects
and make my point.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.790
What's up, man?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.124
Tell me.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.092
O-Dog here?

10:26.827 --> 10:29.262
We got a warrant?

10:29.296 --> 10:32.800
I ain't looking
to take nobody in today.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.206
(whistles)

10:52.886 --> 10:54.822
What do you want?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.456
Offer my condolences.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.692
For your losses this morning.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.193
Nobody should die
like that, man.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.931
But right this minute,
I ain't got no idea

11:03.964 --> 11:05.465
who laid your boys down,
and neither do you.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.167
You might be taking it

11:07.200 --> 11:08.936
back to the wrong block.
Then what?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.070
Ain't gonna be wrong.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.339
Even Leroy hasn't heard
the Forty-Twos were involved.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.342
All respect to Leroy,
he's a hood legend,

11:15.375 --> 11:17.711
but he's been out of the game
for a while.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.947
I got to call this
how I see it on the ground.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.782
Your way only guarantees
more bodies.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.917
Theirs, yours,
folks in the middle.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.819
Let us handle it.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.087
And how long that gonna take?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.956
Nah, we can't look weak.
How about smart?

11:28.989 --> 11:29.990
Come on, man.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.859
War hurts every set,
every block.

11:31.892 --> 11:32.793
You know that.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.394
You should probably
get back in the car

11:34.427 --> 11:35.796
with your partner and drive off.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.071
All right, I'm gone.

11:44.104 --> 11:47.074
I just got a
personal request.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.475
I'm asking you

11:48.508 --> 11:50.343
to keep Leroy's son off-limits.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.378
So, so that's why

11:51.411 --> 11:53.947
you're standing
on my grass.

11:53.981 --> 11:56.016
It's up to Darryl
what he wants to do.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.250
He's 13, man.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.120
You know what I was
doing at 13?

12:00.153 --> 12:02.255
Boy needs to put in the work,
like his pops.

12:04.124 --> 12:08.161
But out of respect for you,
we'll keep Darryl out of it.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.032
Don't need him
to make things right.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.178
(sighs)

12:25.212 --> 12:28.215
(camera beeps)

12:28.248 --> 12:31.351
We're the future old-timers
for the 100th anniversary.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.386
Assuming we're lucky enough
to live as long as Jack Luca.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.155
CHRIS: His generation
broke trail for us,

12:35.188 --> 12:40.093
and it's an honor to serve on
the same team as his grandson.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.129
Sorry, th-that came out
so phony.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.530
But I really,
I really meant it.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.532
Don't worry.
I'll make sure you look good.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.167
STREET:
Easy to do, right?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.502
JILLY: You're all
pretty damn photogenic.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.038
You're gonna all
make me look good.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.206
(chuckles softly)

12:53.240 --> 12:55.342
(bell dings)

12:56.476 --> 12:58.178
Ah.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.580
Whenever you show
up with company,

13:00.613 --> 13:02.549
I know it ain't
social, Hondo.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.918
What you need?

13:04.952 --> 13:08.121
Something I don't
know already.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.456
(bell dings)

13:09.489 --> 13:10.590
Category?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.860
Let's start with the drive-by.

13:12.893 --> 13:13.927
What's the why of it?

13:13.961 --> 13:15.428
You been in that
uniform too long

13:15.462 --> 13:19.432
if you think there's got to be
a why with any of these Y.G.s.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.901
Dorsey, you're plugged in
to all the sets.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.302
That wasn't just
target practice this morning.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.271
If you say so.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.609
You know, I think I might
need to use the head.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.543
Is that cool?

13:30.577 --> 13:33.213
Sorry, it's out of order.
So, if I was to

13:33.246 --> 13:34.882
walk back there through the
door that says "restroom,"

13:34.915 --> 13:37.184
I wouldn't find a mini Vegas
or nothing, would I?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.619
You know, dominoes,
dice, spades.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.488
I know you've been running
the house for over a year, man.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.623
The only reason
I left you in business

13:43.656 --> 13:45.558
is because I figured
there might be a day

13:45.592 --> 13:47.060
when I'd need some information.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.461
And today's that day.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.963
Sing or sting.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.965
Your choice.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.102
Deacon.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.040
I think Mr. Dorsey here might
have heard a little something.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.541
Well, anything helps.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.911
Now, I don't know
this for a true fact,

14:03.944 --> 14:06.046
but there's been a bit of noise
about some new crew

14:06.079 --> 14:08.415
in the ZIP Code trying to take
things to the next level.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.284
That's why the drive-by
was so quiet and pro.

14:11.318 --> 14:14.387
They ain't looking to spray up
blocks like fools used to do.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.256
It ain't personal.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.557
It's business.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.027
My business model
is to deliver

14:20.060 --> 14:22.362
risk-free, worry-free,
cost-efficient,

14:22.395 --> 14:25.098
guaranteed results, Mr. Volkov.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.434
I've been able to take care of
business just fine in-house.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.202
Why should I
spend more money?

14:29.236 --> 14:30.437
You heard about
the three gangbangers

14:30.470 --> 14:31.504
that were killed this morning?

14:31.538 --> 14:33.340
They like to kill each other.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.575
Actually, that was
a commission.

14:35.608 --> 14:36.910
Three targets.

14:36.944 --> 14:39.046
You?
My associates and I.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.381
Zero blowback on the client.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.383
Outsourcing insulates you.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.186
That's why
the New York mobs--

14:46.219 --> 14:48.989
the Italians and Jews-- they
shared an enforcement service

14:49.022 --> 14:51.191
back in the golden years
before World War II.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.492
(laughs)

14:52.525 --> 14:53.593
STEFAN:
Are you kidding me?

14:53.626 --> 14:56.029
How long ago?

14:56.063 --> 14:57.464
You never heard
of Murder Incorporated?

14:57.497 --> 15:00.968
They did over a thousand
contract killings.

15:01.001 --> 15:04.504
I call my company Murder LLC
in their honor.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.106
I'm gonna pass.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.640
How about a free
introductory offer?

15:07.674 --> 15:09.309
(raspy voice):
Free is good.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.315
I'll hit anyone
in the city for you.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.984
You're satisfied with the work,

15:17.017 --> 15:19.019
you give me
your future business.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.320
Just tell me who.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.391
How about Kershner?

15:24.424 --> 15:25.959
Yes, please.

15:25.993 --> 15:29.196
There's this D.A. made my
brother's life miserable.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.497
Rick Kershner.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.000
He's why Ivan
talks like he does.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.434
Got stabbed in the neck
at Chino.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.303
On a crap charge.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.438
Should've been probation,
but Kershner,

15:38.471 --> 15:40.540
he likes to go heavy.
I know the type.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.276
I'll take care of him today.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.377
My pleasure.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.079
Don't overpromise.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.981
Can you even find him that fast?

15:48.015 --> 15:49.716
Part of the package.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.654
I got to ask.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.557
What made you pick
this line of work?

15:57.590 --> 16:00.994
I read a lot of biographies
about successful people.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.296
You know the one thing
that they all have in common?

16:03.330 --> 16:04.531
Hmm?

16:04.564 --> 16:07.134
They do what they love.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.236
I figured I should, too.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.143
My guy in the neighborhood
says this new crew

16:16.176 --> 16:17.144
is straight-up
murder for hire.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.678
They get it done, they
get out. They're pros.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.513
So how do we find out
who they are?

16:20.547 --> 16:23.416
Our baby witness who wasn't
there, Darryl Henderson--

16:23.450 --> 16:25.652
just got word he's been
beating the pavement.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.054
Trying to score a gun.

16:30.057 --> 16:33.393
Uh, h-how much for that one?

16:33.426 --> 16:35.395
Well, you can't go wrong
with the classics.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.429
They're reliable,

16:36.463 --> 16:38.131
easy to conceal. Come here.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.302
Check out that
smooth action.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.605
Smooth rotation, no damage
to the frame, no rust.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.574
It's a good first piece.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.808
How much for this?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.210
Minus the trade,

16:50.243 --> 16:51.744
I can give you
this one for 100.

16:51.778 --> 16:52.745
I got 50.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.181
Show me.
Uh...

16:56.683 --> 16:59.352
Here.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.487
(hums)

17:04.557 --> 17:05.825
What-- Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.794
No, no, no, no.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.563
Oh, yeah, Darryl, now we
do have probable cause.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.232
So you are being detained.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.378
What are you doing, Dom?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.514
Hey, Dad.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.450
That's not a pew.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.619
You see him yet?

17:32.652 --> 17:33.853
Yeah.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.555
Funeral home
showed him to me.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.160
Looks damn good for being,
you know, dead.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.561
Peaceful.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.263
For a change.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.435
Look, we're trying to celebrate
a man's life here.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.571
You need to shake a few hands,
smile at the stories.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.240
Say something nice
for the memorial.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.108
The girl's still waiting
to put you on camera.

17:55.142 --> 17:58.645
Either find the strength
or fake it, but do it.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.613
Let's go.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.754
Get up.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.701
(both grunting)

18:24.704 --> 18:26.806
What is this?

18:26.839 --> 18:28.675
(Luca grunts)

18:28.708 --> 18:30.277
No!

18:30.310 --> 18:31.644
(panting)

18:31.678 --> 18:35.648
No, I'm not gonna lie
about him, Dad.

18:35.682 --> 18:36.783
He wasn't perfect.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.218
No kidding.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.352
Neither are we.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.487
I know.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.589
But I can't do that video.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.196
(door opens)

19:01.874 --> 19:04.611
(sighs)

19:04.644 --> 19:06.313
You're in a world
of trouble, Darryl.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.882
I screwed up, okay?

19:09.916 --> 19:11.618
I always screw up.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.353
My mom's gonna beat my ass,

19:13.386 --> 19:14.854
then she's gonna have
Clarence beat it again.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.324
That her boyfriend?
He live with you?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.859
I call all her guys Clarence.
Just to piss her off.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.194
(chuckles softly)

19:21.228 --> 19:22.362
I was the second
biggest mistake

19:22.395 --> 19:24.497
my dad ever made.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.499
She was the first.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.371
Not even close, kid.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.872
(sighs)

19:32.905 --> 19:35.508
I was there for his biggest
mistake; I caused it.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.644
Your pops ever tell you

19:37.677 --> 19:39.346
how you got the name Darryl?

19:39.379 --> 19:40.680
Like, some uncle or something?

19:40.713 --> 19:42.249
Wasn't no uncle.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.718
(sighs)

19:50.723 --> 19:53.760
Me and Leroy...

19:53.793 --> 19:57.630
and Darryl--
the original Darryl--

19:57.664 --> 20:00.900
we was boys together.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.569
Little bit older than you then.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.903
(chuckles softly)

20:03.936 --> 20:05.705
Hey, you couldn't
tell us nothing.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.807
We just knew we had
it all going on.

20:07.840 --> 20:12.379
But D, he just,
he had this big mouth.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.381
I mean, not to everybody,
you know, but...

20:14.414 --> 20:16.549
You know, we was young,
so, you know, we messed around.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.917
We did a little bit of this,

20:17.950 --> 20:19.652
little bit of that,
you know what I'm saying?

20:19.686 --> 20:21.988
I mean, nothing
too crazy, but...

20:22.021 --> 20:23.456
(sighs)

20:23.490 --> 20:27.327
D just never knew
when to shut up.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.329
Until somebody
shut him up for good.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.464
Just some ignorant-ass
dude on the corner

20:31.498 --> 20:32.965
with a temper
and a gun.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.434
Did he get caught?

20:34.467 --> 20:35.868
Your pops caught him
behind a Laundromat

20:35.902 --> 20:37.837
before I could, and, man,
I wanted vengeance bad,

20:37.870 --> 20:39.772
but Leroy talked me down.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.478
He told me that I was
meant for something

20:45.512 --> 20:47.280
better than the streets, Darryl.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.749
And then he went
around the corner,

20:49.782 --> 20:51.918
took care of
business himself.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.587
Your daddy
went to juvie.

20:54.621 --> 20:58.057
But I went to high school.

20:58.090 --> 21:02.362
And when he got out,
he was who he is.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.531
But he wants
a different life for you.

21:04.564 --> 21:05.765
He thinks I'm weak.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.967
No, no.
He knows you're smart.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.736
Smarter than he was.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.806
It's a heavy name, I get it.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.775
It weighed on me, too,
for a bit.

21:17.844 --> 21:22.782
But then you get better
at making better choices.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.451
Darryl, that's got to start
right here, right now.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.418
Real talk.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.763
What'd you see
on that corner?

21:41.401 --> 21:43.770
I was supposed to be watching.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.738
I-I should've seen it sooner.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.707
I should've said something,
warned 'em.

21:50.743 --> 21:51.878
Three,

21:51.911 --> 21:53.846
maybe four dudes.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.092
Okay, let's do this.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.541
(silenced gunshots)

22:30.049 --> 22:31.451
You better keep talking, Darryl,
because I don't understand.

22:31.484 --> 22:32.385
If you didn't see who was

22:32.419 --> 22:34.554
in that car, then
what were you gonna do

22:34.587 --> 22:35.922
with the gun that you were
trying to buy?

22:35.955 --> 22:37.690
To go talk to Curtis.
Who's Curtis?

22:37.724 --> 22:39.659
This guy who likes to buy
stuff that's been jacked.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.727
So he's a fence?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.795
Yeah. My pops told you
it wasn't the Forty-Twos,

22:42.829 --> 22:44.497
so it only left him
after the shootings.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.565
Why?

22:45.598 --> 22:47.467
Because he got his safe
jacked. Stash and cash.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.068
Hey, were you there
for that, too?

22:49.101 --> 22:50.837
No, but I knew it happened.
I knew who did it.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.171
The three dead dudes.
Yeah.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.741
Curtis ain't no G. He's soft.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.108
So then why go talk
to him with a gun?

22:56.142 --> 22:58.411
Because I wanted to see
who he put in the car.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.146
All right.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.981
Where can we find Curtis?

23:02.014 --> 23:04.417
(music playing over TV)

23:06.453 --> 23:08.421
(silenced gunshots,
men grunting)

23:13.159 --> 23:14.126
(grenades pop, Curtis grunts)

23:17.497 --> 23:19.098
Gun!

23:19.131 --> 23:21.200
Give me your hands!
Give me your hands! Get up!

23:21.233 --> 23:24.471
Up! Up!

23:24.504 --> 23:26.072
CHRIS: Left side clear!
TAN: Right side clear!

23:26.105 --> 23:27.874
Chris out!
Tan out!

23:29.208 --> 23:31.744
(silenced gunshots,
men grunting)

23:31.778 --> 23:32.745
TAN:
All clear.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.048
You want to tell us
what the hell this is?

23:36.082 --> 23:39.018
I didn't know Trick was gonna
lay 'em down like that.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.453
I thought he was just yapping!

23:40.487 --> 23:41.788
Who is Trick?!

23:41.821 --> 23:42.922
I want a lawyer.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.657
I want a lawyer!
Shut up.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.593
Shut up! Shut your mouth!
I want a lawyer! I want a...

23:46.626 --> 23:48.928
(phone vibrating)

23:53.500 --> 23:55.835
Body on the cement.

23:55.868 --> 23:59.506
A D.A., dead by drive-by
an hour ago.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.607
What the hell?

24:00.640 --> 24:03.075
Cortez says it looks like
same caliber, same M.O.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.210
No witnesses.

24:04.243 --> 24:05.812
Smooth as butter.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.882
Who is Trick?

24:18.725 --> 24:20.660
(door buzzes)

24:20.693 --> 24:21.761
Tell me Darryl's alive.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.733
We got him at headquarters.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.802
He thinks he's got a gun
charge hanging over his head,

24:29.836 --> 24:31.538
but... it was
borderline entrapment.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.540
I'll let him go
when the time is right.

24:33.573 --> 24:36.142
(chuckles) Damn.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.010
That's, uh...

24:38.044 --> 24:39.912
That's a whole new
kind of tough love.

24:39.946 --> 24:42.749
You asked me to keep him alive.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.517
You know Trick Carter?

24:44.551 --> 24:47.086
Yeah, yeah, he's an independent
paroled a few weeks ago. Why?

24:47.119 --> 24:49.221
He got paid to hit the
young Gs this morning.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.791
Well, a D.A. just got killed
in the same kind of drive-by.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.960
Ah, and all of a sudden,
the city starts to care,

24:53.993 --> 24:55.094
right like that.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.163
Leroy, we need to know
who else might have hired him

24:57.196 --> 24:58.164
before the body count goes up.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.899
What, you can't find him?

24:59.932 --> 25:02.769
We can't protect the targets if
we don't know who they are, man.

25:02.802 --> 25:05.672
But Trick made connections
in here.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.678
You want me to be
your inside source?

25:14.146 --> 25:16.082
(sighs)

25:20.119 --> 25:22.054
I mean something in here.

25:22.088 --> 25:25.592
And out there.

25:25.625 --> 25:29.228
I got respect, influence.

25:29.261 --> 25:32.298
There's been a truce on the
streets 'cause I called for it.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.641
This ain't your set.
It's nobody's set.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.576
You know I can't snitch, Hondo.

25:53.185 --> 25:56.055
You know, everything I've done
since what happened back then

25:56.088 --> 25:58.925
was me trying to be as worthy
as you thought I was.

25:58.958 --> 26:02.094
You helped make
me who I am.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.963
But I made you who you are, too,

26:03.996 --> 26:06.198
and I've been sorry
about that ever since.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.067
(chuckles) Man, come on.
Get over yourself.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.837
I'd be right here
even if we never met.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.239
We all got our own paths.
This was mine.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.274
You just happened to
jaywalk across it back then.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.143
You hear what I'm saying?

26:19.211 --> 26:21.147
This is not your fault.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.851
But Darryl--

26:24.884 --> 26:27.286
oh, he ain't like me, man.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.822
He won't survive this life.

26:29.856 --> 26:31.924
He's just trying to earn
your respect the wrong way.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.225
Darryl's more
like you, man.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.228
He's a thinker, but he got
other options in life.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.596
I didn't.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.868
Or maybe I just didn't want 'em.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.773
Those were Hammers that died
this morning, your set, Leroy.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.976
That gives you every right
to find out why and who.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.978
But the only way
to save the truce,

26:52.011 --> 26:55.782
to save Darryl, is to get us
to the real shooters.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.283
You just got to decide

26:57.316 --> 27:00.019
how far you're willing to go
for your son.

27:02.789 --> 27:03.923
(music playing over TV)

27:12.799 --> 27:14.166
(silenced gunshots)

27:19.038 --> 27:21.007
(speaks Russian)

27:21.040 --> 27:22.374
(speaks Russian)

27:27.346 --> 27:29.315
Proof of concept.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.787
Are you free tonight?

27:34.821 --> 27:37.356
I'm no longer free.
But I'm available.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.258
There's a real estate developer
who thinks he's too good

27:39.291 --> 27:42.428
to use my construction
companies for his projects.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.130
He was rude about it.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.431
I don't need to know why,
just who.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.333
His name is Nate Wilson.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.368
Blowhard, thinks
he's something.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.904
Price?

27:51.938 --> 27:53.740
$20,000.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.708
Hmm.

27:55.742 --> 27:58.377
Him and his wife-- $35,000
for the pair of them.

27:58.410 --> 28:01.147
Do her first.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.249
Make him see it.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.251
Then him.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.319
Get his face on camera
when she goes down.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.856
The optional video package
will be an extra five.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.057
(chuckles softly)

28:11.090 --> 28:13.926
Got to say, the
video's a great touch.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.261
Thanks.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.396
Hey.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.498
Heard you were one
badass gun dealer.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.201
The kid was
a soft target.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.903
Can I buy you
a beer tonight?

28:23.936 --> 28:24.971
Celebrate?

28:25.004 --> 28:26.372
You don't quit, do you?

28:26.405 --> 28:28.808
Sometimes a beer's
just a beer, Chris.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.476
You know we're
just playing, right?

28:30.509 --> 28:31.911
You're not careful,
you're gonna hurt my feelings.

28:31.944 --> 28:32.945
Well, it's nothing
personal.

28:32.979 --> 28:35.247
I just have a hard policy
against dating cops,

28:35.281 --> 28:38.217
any cops, anywhere,
let alone on the same team.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.518
So, to be clear,

28:39.551 --> 28:42.254
what you're saying
is, minus the badge,

28:42.288 --> 28:44.323
you'd go out with me.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.058
I didn't say that.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.026
How about just one date?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.861
Although I got to tell you,
in all modesty,

28:48.895 --> 28:50.997
I've never had anyone
stop at just one,

28:51.030 --> 28:52.498
but you could try.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.834
For real now, come on.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.468
You need to ease off a little.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.537
I've worked
too hard, too long

28:58.570 --> 29:01.540
to risk my rep for pheromones,
and I'm not gonna be the cop

29:01.573 --> 29:03.776
that every other cop thinks
they could sleep with.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.379
Yeah. Okay.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.415
Sorry.
(chuckles)

29:09.448 --> 29:11.550
I know when to take no
for an answer, so...

29:11.583 --> 29:13.019
I get it. I do.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.386
Thanks.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.388
Yeah, sorry.

29:21.393 --> 29:24.163
Just try being Chris for
a minute, a woman in SWAT.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.966
Jokes, comments...

29:26.999 --> 29:28.234
accidental grabby hands.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.538
It's not like that, dude.
I do respect her.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.140
She doesn't need a teammate
hitting on her, too.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.375
Honor her
journey, dude.

29:36.408 --> 29:37.910
Look, I'm hearing you.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.045
Doesn't mean
she doesn't like me.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.113
You're not gonna find out
while you're both on the team.

29:41.147 --> 29:44.450
Besides, what's wrong
with the easy option?

29:44.483 --> 29:46.585
What do you mean?

29:46.618 --> 29:49.989
Jilly, man. Been trying
to get your attention all day.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.924
Yeah, I got
that vibe, too.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.592
It's not too late.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.561
Or is available not your type?

29:58.430 --> 30:00.366
Come on.
(grunting)

30:07.940 --> 30:09.876
Dinner?

30:12.111 --> 30:14.080
Food. You want some?

30:14.113 --> 30:15.481
No, I'm good.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.449
Stick with my coffee.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.921
You're checking up
on me.

30:21.954 --> 30:23.222
Yep.

30:23.255 --> 30:26.959
I feel like
I'm in a petting zoo.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.961
All I want to do is bite people.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.596
(chuckles)

30:30.629 --> 30:33.299
Yeah, don't
do that, Luca.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.305
You want to talk about it?

30:39.338 --> 30:40.973
You know, I'm done hearing
all the stories about

30:41.007 --> 30:43.109
how brave my grandfather was,
you know? He wasn't.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.544
I mean, I wasn't even
speaking to him at the end.

30:45.577 --> 30:46.545
Since when?

30:48.680 --> 30:51.283
I was waiting for an apology.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.019
And then the clock stopped.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.287
So that's that,
you know?

30:55.321 --> 30:58.024
He can't apologize
and I can't forgive.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.225
What happened, man?

31:02.494 --> 31:04.530
He didn't want me on your team.

31:06.565 --> 31:09.902
He said SWAT leaders
look like him, me,

31:09.936 --> 31:11.403
not like you.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.047
(sighs)

31:21.080 --> 31:24.050
Luca...

31:24.083 --> 31:27.319
(sighs) those were the facts
of life when he was in SWAT.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.055
It was a white man's club.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.457
You know what?
History is a lousy excuse.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.292
Oh, I'm not excusing him,
make no mistake.

31:33.325 --> 31:34.360
He tried to juice

31:34.393 --> 31:36.929
a move for me to Mumford's team
to save my career.

31:36.963 --> 31:39.565
I never even
told my dad

31:39.598 --> 31:41.700
because I was afraid
whose side he'd take.

31:41.733 --> 31:46.372
We can still love people
despite their mistakes, man.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.639
They're still family.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.275
You're a better person than me.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.944
(scoffs)
I doubt that.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.046
Back when that day care center
got torched

31:54.080 --> 31:56.148
and your granddaddy was carrying
kids out four at a time,

31:56.182 --> 31:58.450
I don't remember hearing that
he was picking 'em by color.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.552
Luca,

32:00.586 --> 32:03.355
I know you got it in you
to respect what he did

32:03.389 --> 32:05.057
and try to forget what he said.

32:05.091 --> 32:09.395
Yeah, I don't know
how to separate that.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.562
I don't.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.332
I feel you. I do.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.334
But maybe you can let
your granddaddy rest in peace

32:15.367 --> 32:17.669
along with his old ideas.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.638
Luca, look at this team.

32:19.671 --> 32:20.973
Look at us.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.311
We are the change that counts.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.982
(phone vibrating)

32:34.486 --> 32:37.189
Yeah.

32:37.223 --> 32:39.992
Yeah, I'll accept
the charges.

32:40.026 --> 32:41.327
Leroy.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.534
Hey, did you have
any of that cake?

32:48.567 --> 32:50.102
I ate the whole piece.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.071
All wedding cake
should be chocolate.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.139
(chuckles)

32:53.172 --> 32:55.507
Think we might have missed them?

32:55.541 --> 32:58.210
No, we did not.

32:58.244 --> 32:59.211
I'm just saying.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.313
Shut up, man.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.254
TRICK:
That's them.

33:08.287 --> 33:09.655
(engine starts)
Let's go.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.330
*

33:22.168 --> 33:25.671
Slow down.
I got to shoot her first.

33:27.573 --> 33:28.640
(phone ringing)

33:28.674 --> 33:30.142
Who's calling you now?
I don't know.

33:30.176 --> 33:31.410
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.412
I don't have a shot.

33:33.445 --> 33:34.413
NATE:
Hello.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.515
Mr. Wilson, this is the LAPD.

33:36.548 --> 33:37.816
What?
Your office said
you're at a wedding.

33:37.849 --> 33:38.617
Are you still there?

33:38.650 --> 33:41.120
We're just walking
to the car. Why?

33:41.153 --> 33:42.688
Go back inside now.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.290
I need you to stay
inside the building,

33:44.323 --> 33:46.158
away from the entrance.
Do you understand me?

33:46.192 --> 33:46.992
You and your wife

33:47.025 --> 33:49.195
are in danger.
We're almost there.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.596
Don't let 'em go! Don't let
'em go! Don't let 'em go!

33:50.629 --> 33:51.830
Go, let's go.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.765
(tires screeching)

33:55.201 --> 33:57.203
God. Oh, my...
I got to get her first.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.171
(sirens approaching)

33:59.205 --> 34:01.140
Go, go!

34:01.173 --> 34:02.708
Go!

34:02.741 --> 34:05.344
(sirens wailing)

34:05.377 --> 34:07.146
Go, go, go!

34:07.179 --> 34:09.215
Get us the hell out of here!
Go!

34:12.718 --> 34:14.620
(sirens wailing)

34:19.758 --> 34:22.628
Right there in the park!
The park! The park!

34:49.621 --> 34:51.557
Chris, Tan, Street,
we need a front side perimeter.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.592
Go wide, make sure
the park is clear.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.362
PILOT: Air 17 to D Team,
we're overhead.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.764
DEACON:
30-David to Air 17, stay close.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.632
Suspects are still in the SUV.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.234
Active shooters.
PILOT: Roger that.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.203
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

35:04.236 --> 35:05.704
What are we gonna do? What
are we gonna do?

35:05.737 --> 35:07.206
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna...? (groans)

35:08.207 --> 35:09.641
Now I can think.

35:09.675 --> 35:12.211
(helicopter whirring overhead)

35:14.213 --> 35:15.481
Don't shoot!

35:15.514 --> 35:16.648
Don't shoot!
HONDO:
Get down!

35:16.682 --> 35:18.717
Stay down, face down!

35:21.287 --> 35:22.888
HONDO:
20-David to D Team.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.156
Rabbit is running
your direction.

35:25.957 --> 35:29.395
(grunting)

35:29.428 --> 35:31.797
Police!

35:31.830 --> 35:33.199
Stop moving!
Don't shoot! Please!

35:33.232 --> 35:34.766
I want hands on.
Go! Go!

35:35.601 --> 35:36.702
Get up.

35:36.735 --> 35:40.939
HONDO:
Trick, game over, man.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.575
It's up to you
how you come out of this.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.445
Ain't none of you gonna die
of old age in there.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.846
Let's get this over and done.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.187
We can stay here all night,
Trick. Same result.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.192
(gunshot)
(Eddie groans)

36:03.595 --> 36:05.797
So, what's the plan now, Trick?

36:07.499 --> 36:09.501
You think you're ready for me?

36:09.535 --> 36:12.438
It ain't got to go down
like this, man. Deacon?

36:12.471 --> 36:14.306
Get the spotlight on him.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.208
30-David to Air 17.
Hit the lights.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.614
(helicopter whirring)

36:34.593 --> 36:36.228
Come out slowly, Trick!

36:36.262 --> 36:37.763
Slowly!

36:40.632 --> 36:41.933
Lose the gun, Trick.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.870
Let me see the gun.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.638
Step away from the car.

36:49.508 --> 36:50.676
Do it!

36:54.045 --> 36:55.814
(grunts)

36:55.847 --> 36:58.317
Deac, Luca, go in. Go!

37:00.786 --> 37:03.789
(helicopter whirring)

37:05.791 --> 37:09.295
*

37:09.328 --> 37:12.531
20-David to all D Team.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.833
Code Four.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.705
(siren wailing in distance)

37:22.974 --> 37:24.543
Good work, everybody.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.412
How are the Wilsons?
They're tough. They thanked

37:26.445 --> 37:27.746
everybody and drove
themselves home.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.681
Huh.
Okay, I'm impressed.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.550
Both of the Volkov
brothers are in custody.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.951
Lawyered up already.

37:32.984 --> 37:35.053
Man, these guys even
give Russians a bad name.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.822
Murder-for-hire,
killing a prosecutor--

37:36.855 --> 37:39.257
how many life sentences does
that get you?
Not enough.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.662
It's been a long day.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.964
Your grandfather would have been
very proud of you.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.675
(whistling)

37:56.708 --> 37:58.677
(sighs)

38:01.112 --> 38:03.449
(clicks tongue)

38:10.822 --> 38:12.824
Still here?

38:12.858 --> 38:15.461
Yeah, just, you know,
packing up.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.929
Yeah.
You hungry?

38:17.963 --> 38:19.565
You want to get
something to eat?

38:19.598 --> 38:22.568
You could tell me, uh,
how you started your business.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.870
I've just never met
a videographer before.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.938
Not counting
Instagram wannabes.

38:26.972 --> 38:30.108
Right. Uh, that's so sweet
of you, but... Hey!

38:30.141 --> 38:31.477
Hey. You ready?
Yeah.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.913
Where are you guys going?

38:34.946 --> 38:37.383
Um, I don't think
we've decided yet.
You know, we could

38:37.416 --> 38:39.818
go to that, uh, Casa Vieja.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.853
They-they do, like,
organic margaritas

38:41.887 --> 38:43.989
if-if you're into
that kind of thing.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.825
It's... it's just me
and Jilly tonight.
Yeah.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.894
I'll go load up my car.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.632
Sounds like a date.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.000
Yeah. (chuckles) It is.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.369
I... I thought you liked men.

38:57.403 --> 38:59.438
I love men, and
I also love women.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.440
Why does a girl
have to choose?

39:01.473 --> 39:04.476
Best part? She's not a cop.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.512
What am I missing?
Good night, guys.

39:08.714 --> 39:11.850
Chris and Jilly
have a date, so...

39:11.883 --> 39:14.420
Guess we were reading
the wrong vibe.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.021
It makes sense.

39:16.054 --> 39:19.024
(chuckles) Wow, you
lost both girls.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.860
To each other.
Impressive work, playboy.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.061
You knew.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.996
Oh, about Chris?

39:25.030 --> 39:26.832
Oh, yeah.
Interesting lady.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.600
Many levels.

39:28.634 --> 39:31.169
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.738
Thanks for your help.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.973
Any time.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.908
(beeps)

39:43.582 --> 39:45.551
(sighs)
I reached your mom.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.085
She's in Vegas.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.788
With whichever Clarence drove.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.890
Well, she's on her way back now.
Doesn't even matter.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.892
You guys are just gonna put me
in juvie anyways.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.961
Darryl, I talked
to your pops.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.896
Your auntie up north,
his sister Tanya--

39:57.929 --> 40:00.632
you like her?
She's nice.

40:00.666 --> 40:01.967
Well, I asked your mom
if she'd be willing

40:02.000 --> 40:03.769
to let you go stay
with her for a while.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.737
Away from all the noise.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.473
She said okay.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.541
My auntie would take me?
Yeah.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.009
She would.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.950
Darryl...

40:18.984 --> 40:20.652
that's a new school.

40:20.686 --> 40:24.556
New friends...
and no more Clarences.

40:24.590 --> 40:25.924
(chuckles)

40:25.957 --> 40:28.460
But that's a choice
you got to make.

40:30.195 --> 40:32.063
I want to see my pops first.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.567
All right.

40:38.003 --> 40:40.038
CARL:
My dad wasn't a vain man,

40:40.071 --> 40:42.808
except about his waist size.

40:42.841 --> 40:45.977
He could still button the pants
on his old uniform.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.113
He was proud of that.

40:48.146 --> 40:51.917
He was proud of being one of
SWAT's first-ever team leaders.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.954
(lock buzzes)

40:59.257 --> 41:01.560
CARL:
The day I made SWAT,

41:01.593 --> 41:03.128
my dad cried.

41:03.161 --> 41:06.865
The next time I saw him cry was
when my son took the oath.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.734
The third generation
of Lucas

41:08.767 --> 41:11.069
to wear the uniform
and the SWAT patch.

41:13.605 --> 41:15.541
Proudest day of my life, too.

41:17.308 --> 41:20.278
Um, my dad wasn't
the most patient man.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.581
I can hear him yelling out,

41:22.614 --> 41:23.682
"Zip it, already!"

41:23.715 --> 41:25.884
So...

41:25.917 --> 41:30.188
why don't we watch the video the
department made in his honor?

41:30.221 --> 41:34.059
MALE NARRATOR:
Jack Luca, 1933 to 2017.

41:34.092 --> 41:36.161
A life of service to his city
with the integrity,

41:36.194 --> 41:38.764
commitment and reverence
for the law

41:38.797 --> 41:41.166
that the LAPD honors
as its mission.

41:45.236 --> 41:47.773
LUCA:
My grandfather

41:47.806 --> 41:49.775
was a stubborn man.

41:49.808 --> 41:55.547
He was strict and opinionated

41:55.581 --> 41:56.948
and slow to change.

41:59.084 --> 42:01.587
He defined his era.

42:01.620 --> 42:04.690
And I learned to be
a better cop because of him.

42:15.166 --> 42:17.703
I loved him.

42:17.736 --> 42:22.674
I mean, I wish we could
keep talking to each other.

42:22.708 --> 42:25.243
I still had things
to say to him.

42:26.978 --> 42:29.347
MALE NARRATOR:
Jack's courage and dedication

42:29.380 --> 42:31.817
set a standard of excellence

42:31.850 --> 42:33.585
that continues to inspire

42:33.619 --> 42:35.253
the men and women
of the department.
