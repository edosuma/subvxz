<i>Subtitles by - KG -</i>

00:44.875 --> 00:47.995
- Good morning.
- At this hour you turn up to work?

00:48.075 --> 00:51.035
- You see?
- It's midday Danie.

01:02.915 --> 01:05.795
- What needs to be done?
- I'm testing the brakes.

01:05.875 --> 01:09.195
- It has to be ready for this evening.
- Okay.

01:09.275 --> 01:13.515
We will make an arts center
which improves the cultural aspect...

01:13.595 --> 01:19.835
Come on Michele, you're boring us
Relax, huh. You're the mayor now.

01:19.915 --> 01:23.155
We know what's important is important.
Especially for us.

01:24.395 --> 01:29.475
- How do we organize ourselves?
- Your companies, but our workers.

01:29.555 --> 01:33.875
I made a lot of promises for that idiot there.

01:33.955 --> 01:37.755
- We keep the cinema and bowling alley.
- Did you speak with Conte?

01:37.835 --> 01:41.275
- I think there shouldn't be any problems.
- Good.

01:41.355 --> 01:45.555
Actually, there is a problem.
The Romano brothers.

01:45.635 --> 01:48.115
The car dealers?

01:48.195 --> 01:52.155
Their dealership is located in the area.

01:53.955 --> 01:56.755
Where is he? You should've fixed it.

01:56.835 --> 02:03.555
I've been there and was told that the dealership
is off limits. It belonged to their late father.

02:08.195 --> 02:11.315
Can you handle it, Ciro?

02:13.035 --> 02:16.035
- I'll handle it.
- Then it's settled.

02:47.515 --> 02:52.075
- One of these days he'll crack his head open.
- Too hard headed for that.

02:52.155 --> 02:55.795
- Who is it?
- A fool who's in love.

02:55.875 --> 02:58.355
- He's cute isn't he?
- Yeah.

03:06.995 --> 03:08.595
And?

03:08.675 --> 03:11.595
Gennaro Savastano thinks he's God.

03:11.675 --> 03:16.195
- He thinks he's like his father.
- Genny is close to Conte...

03:16.275 --> 03:19.955
and the other families.
When's he going to go?

03:20.035 --> 03:23.035
Tonino. Toni...

03:26.355 --> 03:28.875
How's things, how is Don Salvatore?

03:28.955 --> 03:32.915
I know where he is.
He prays and works.

03:32.995 --> 03:35.595
Is he happy the way things are running?

03:35.675 --> 03:39.515
- Who's not happy?
- I'm happy.

03:39.595 --> 03:42.835
We should all be happy.

03:42.915 --> 03:46.115
Give him by best.

03:50.075 --> 03:52.955
Let's go, Rosario.

04:13.595 --> 04:16.635
- Ciro's looking for you.
- Now?

04:19.195 --> 04:23.195
- You need me to deliver again?
- No, it's something else.

04:23.275 --> 04:25.075
I'm coming.

04:28.395 --> 04:31.435
- Hey, where are you going?
- Get your hands off me.

04:31.515 --> 04:37.115
- I pay you to work, not to run around.
- My uncle says that mother is sick.

04:38.235 --> 04:42.115
Relax.
The scooter will be ready in the morning.

05:12.555 --> 05:16.275
- Am I shooting?
- One thing at a time.

05:16.355 --> 05:20.235
Go out and have some fun. Here you go.

05:20.315 --> 05:23.475
Why don't we go out tonight?

05:23.555 --> 05:27.115
Are you gay or what?
I have a family.

05:27.195 --> 05:32.155
- Don't you have a girlfriend?
- Of course I do. Look.

05:32.235 --> 05:35.595
- Let me see.
- Her name is Manu.

05:39.995 --> 05:43.475
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Yes, she is.

05:43.555 --> 05:48.795
Go and fuck Manu.
You have to do something important tomorrow.

05:48.875 --> 05:52.155
- Anything for you, Ciro.
- Go now.

07:58.795 --> 08:00.275
- Hey.
- Lets head out.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.915
- Where?
- We'll go for a ride.

08:02.995 --> 08:07.595
- Don't be nuts, my father won't allow it.
- We'll be back early.

08:07.675 --> 08:12.315
- I have school tomorrow.
- Come on, I'll take you out for pizza.

08:12.395 --> 08:16.155
- Let me talk to your father.
- Yeah, sure.

08:16.235 --> 08:18.995
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow?

08:34.355 --> 08:39.995
- You haven't been home for two weeks.
- I have to work, Mom.

08:40.075 --> 08:42.635
- Stay.
- I can't.

08:42.715 --> 08:46.915
I have to go to Marbella.
Otherwise, the boss gets mad.

08:46.995 --> 08:49.075
Conte, he's a hell of a worker.

08:49.155 --> 08:53.315
- Come on, you don't even know him.
- You think I don't know what you're doing.

08:53.395 --> 08:56.635
Don't be like that, we never see each other.

08:56.715 --> 09:01.035
And when I see you, you cry.
Come on, Mom.

09:04.115 --> 09:07.755
I'll be back soon.
I promise.

09:08.915 --> 09:13.155
Goodbye, Mom.

09:33.435 --> 09:35.595
- Hey brother.

09:37.075 --> 09:39.915
- How are you?
- Good. How's the job?

09:39.995 --> 09:43.515
Awesome. The boss likes me.

09:43.595 --> 09:47.315
- He says I'll get very far.
- Maybe he'll promote you from driving.

09:47.395 --> 09:50.315
- Are you kidding?
- Who me? No, never.

09:50.395 --> 09:54.915
- You want to fight? I'll beat you.
- What are you doing, man?

10:00.715 --> 10:06.195
I have to go. Take care of mom.
She seems exhausted.

10:07.915 --> 10:11.155
- Don't do anything stupid.
- You don't have to worry.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.755
Bye, Danie.

10:40.795 --> 10:43.675
There he is. Now we do it.

10:54.875 --> 10:58.115
BROTHERS ROMANOS Car Dealers

11:32.475 --> 11:34.955
Go, go!

11:54.235 --> 11:56.755
Ciro.

12:01.515 --> 12:04.795
- Hello.
- And?

12:06.395 --> 12:10.515
The Romano brothers have been taken care of.

12:10.595 --> 12:14.835
You know what Dad used to say Toni?
I have war in my head.

12:14.915 --> 12:18.475
But he has a head for war.

12:18.555 --> 12:21.235
And what does it mean Gennaro?

12:21.315 --> 12:25.275
That you're a good soldier.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.555
Thank you, Ciro.

12:34.475 --> 12:38.635
Tell Salvatore that we do what it takes.

12:51.035 --> 12:55.275
I dedicate this next song for
the newlyweds. Congratulations.

13:00.755 --> 13:04.355
You understand Ciro?
Capaebomba is running piazza Piscinola?

13:04.435 --> 13:06.435
Really?

13:06.515 --> 13:09.835
He's 19 years.
What can you do about it?

13:09.915 --> 13:15.355
Nothing. But it's us that fought the
wars for Don Pietro and we're still here.

13:15.435 --> 13:20.635
Thank god you're still here and didn't
end up like Attilio and the others.

13:34.395 --> 13:39.115
That piece of shit.
He says that I'm a soldier.

13:41.115 --> 13:46.395
- And that soldiers are only good for war.
- What can you do Ciro, go to war alone?

13:48.275 --> 13:51.915
Alone? Aren't you with me?

13:54.355 --> 13:57.795
Of course I am.

13:58.995 --> 14:03.795
At the orphanage the nuns used to say:

14:03.875 --> 14:08.475
"Earthquakes are good for the earth."

14:09.875 --> 14:13.115
"They're like when someone isn't well."

14:13.195 --> 14:18.595
It gets worse and worse until it erupts...

14:19.635 --> 14:22.235
or dies.

14:22.315 --> 14:26.155
Therefore, earthquakes are good.

14:31.315 --> 14:35.155
Call Danielino, he's got something
important to do.

15:29.635 --> 15:32.275
Danie.

15:32.355 --> 15:35.835
What do you think about that trip
to the dealership?

15:35.915 --> 15:39.155
Nothing. It's not my business.

15:40.275 --> 15:43.275
You weren't scared?

15:44.395 --> 15:48.515
You'd probably be scared
if you were shooting.

15:48.595 --> 15:52.515
- Are you asking me to shoot?
- Can you do it?

15:52.595 --> 15:56.555
- I don't know.
- Can you? Let's see if you're capable.

15:56.635 --> 15:59.675
Here. Show me what you can do.

16:03.155 --> 16:06.715
Look at that.

16:06.795 --> 16:11.755
Are you in a movie or what?
Hold it straight. Also your head.

16:13.555 --> 16:16.595
Are you ready?

16:16.675 --> 16:19.155
Come on, go.

16:22.875 --> 16:26.595
The arm should be straight.
Like this, hold it.

16:27.795 --> 16:30.635
Hold your breath.

16:33.595 --> 16:35.755
Go.

16:42.475 --> 16:46.675
- I hit it.
- One out of two. It's good.

16:46.755 --> 16:50.035
- Let me try again.
- Do you like it?

16:51.955 --> 16:54.795
That's enough, enough.

16:55.955 --> 16:59.555
Do you only shoot bottles?

17:00.755 --> 17:03.715
Or would you shoot for real?

17:03.795 --> 17:07.915
It's something else to shoot
a human. You must get close.

17:08.915 --> 17:13.194
You may be afraid, Danie.

17:13.275 --> 17:15.994
Do you get scared?

17:17.675 --> 17:20.115
Good.

17:41.195 --> 17:43.795
That's him.

17:45.955 --> 17:49.555
Can you see him?

17:49.635 --> 17:53.115
Who is it? What has he done?

17:53.195 --> 17:57.995
No one.
One who doesn't pay their debt.

17:58.075 --> 18:00.195
His name Tonino Russo.

18:00.275 --> 18:03.395
We have spoken to him already,
but he doesn't get it.

18:04.395 --> 18:09.355
Now Gennaro's angry.
He said that's enough.

18:14.395 --> 18:18.595
- It will happen tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night?

18:18.675 --> 18:24.835
When there is no one around,
you come and do it.

18:24.915 --> 18:27.715
Then you go straight home.
Understand?

18:27.795 --> 18:33.595
Straight home. Then you call me,
and then we can hit the city.

18:38.955 --> 18:42.675
- Are you about to shit your pants?
- Who me? Never.

18:45.035 --> 18:49.075
I believe in you.
I know you can do it.

18:50.635 --> 18:53.835
But no one can know about it.
No one.

18:57.115 --> 19:00.115
Here's an advance.

19:00.195 --> 19:02.355
Take it.

19:03.435 --> 19:06.275
You get the rest later.

19:14.035 --> 19:16.675
It's only the beginning.

19:18.075 --> 19:20.635
Let's go.

19:57.875 --> 20:00.835
- Trak, look who's here.
- Give me another one.

20:00.915 --> 20:04.555
- Look how tall he is.
- What?

20:04.635 --> 20:08.115
You're quite high.
Give me another one.

20:08.195 --> 20:11.235
Do.
- Shut up. Open up.

20:11.315 --> 20:14.035
He loves it.

20:19.075 --> 20:23.755
- Hey Daniele. How are you?
- Great.

20:23.835 --> 20:26.995
- Who are you here with?
- Some friends.

20:27.075 --> 20:30.115
- Okay.
- You're with Genny Savastano?

20:30.195 --> 20:33.155
- I work for him now.
- Really?

20:33.235 --> 20:35.755
I'll introduce him to you.

20:38.955 --> 20:43.675
Genny. Let me introduce you to a friend.

20:43.755 --> 20:47.395
- It's a pleasure.
- Pleasure, Bruno.

20:47.475 --> 20:50.515
What are you doing for him?

20:50.595 --> 20:52.955
What do you think?

21:03.715 --> 21:06.435
Come here, you fool.

21:23.795 --> 21:28.115
- You have dirty hands.
- I wash them all the time.

21:30.275 --> 21:34.555
- But they smell good.
- Yours are really filthy.

21:54.635 --> 21:58.675
Now you're fine.
What would you do without me?

22:03.515 --> 22:06.835
- What are you doing?
- Let's be together tonight?

22:06.915 --> 22:10.675
- How?
- Come on. I want you.

22:12.395 --> 22:16.635
Not tonight.
But dad is not home in the morning.

22:20.515 --> 22:24.395
- What is it? Aren't you glad?
- Yes.

22:54.715 --> 22:59.555
Ok then, a ring of red gold
with genuine diamonds.

22:59.635 --> 23:03.035
- Okay. It's really nice.
- Perfect.

23:11.235 --> 23:14.315
- I'll pay cash.
- Fine.

23:30.435 --> 23:32.675
Come in.

23:35.475 --> 23:38.675
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

23:45.275 --> 23:48.915
Once you've killed him
this has to disappear.

23:48.995 --> 23:52.635
Drive slowly if you go with a motorcycle.

23:52.715 --> 23:58.075
If you are stopped all hell
breaks loose, understand?

23:58.155 --> 24:02.595
Speaking of motorcycles,
I promised you one.

24:09.275 --> 24:12.475
Are you happy?

24:14.595 --> 24:17.715
Hurry. Off you go.

26:39.915 --> 26:42.675
Toni.

28:28.315 --> 28:31.995
Danie, what is it?

28:32.075 --> 28:35.675
Nothing. It's cold.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.715
You didn't like it?

28:38.795 --> 28:41.555
I liked it too much.

28:55.475 --> 28:58.435
Look what I found.

29:10.115 --> 29:14.595
- This is for you.
- Is it real?

29:14.675 --> 29:17.275
- Will you marry me?
- You're mad.

29:17.355 --> 29:20.275
Answer me. Will you marry me?

29:20.355 --> 29:21.995
Yes.

29:30.395 --> 29:34.795
The assailants followed him
into the store,

29:34.875 --> 29:38.315
and shot him, and they escaped.

29:38.395 --> 29:42.795
It happened quickly,
but eyewitnesses saw two people

29:42.875 --> 29:45.995
with helmets, who hid their faces.

29:46.075 --> 29:50.035
The victim was Tonino Russo-

29:50.115 --> 29:53.795
a prominent member in the Conte clan.

29:53.875 --> 29:57.595
The murder will probably

29:57.675 --> 30:01.915
lead to more innocent victims.

30:01.995 --> 30:04.395
Wait a minute.

30:07.635 --> 30:11.435
You could have said, who it was.

30:11.515 --> 30:16.635
I didn't tell you because it would
have put more pressure on you. Understand?

30:16.715 --> 30:18.595
You did good. Where are you?

30:18.675 --> 30:22.315
At Domiziana by Castelvolturno with Manu.

30:22.395 --> 30:25.675
Doing what?
Why didn't you go home?

30:25.755 --> 30:29.395
- I couldn't be at home.
- Okay I get it.

30:30.875 --> 30:35.035
Listen. Go home immediately.

30:36.595 --> 30:39.195
So you can get another 500 euros.

30:40.195 --> 30:44.035
It's better that way. I'm waiting for you.

30:59.035 --> 31:02.235
I have to go. I'll call you later.

31:02.315 --> 31:05.315
Are you just leaving me here?

31:05.395 --> 31:08.155
I'll come get you later.

31:55.235 --> 31:58.075
- Should we wait all night?
- Why, are you busy?

31:58.155 --> 32:01.395
- I'm just asking.
- We expect him to be here shortly.

32:01.475 --> 32:05.355
- And when we find him?
- We'll take it easy.

32:08.155 --> 32:12.715
- We shouldn't scare him.
- We get him to laugh.

32:35.955 --> 32:39.115
- What's up?
- Can you pick up my girlfriend?

32:39.195 --> 32:41.915
- Your girlfriend?
- You don't know her, her name is Manu.

32:41.995 --> 32:45.075
She is in front of Bar Italia on Domiziana.

32:47.315 --> 32:51.035
Manu. Don't worry. Everything's ok.

32:51.115 --> 32:54.835
My friend Bruno's coming to get you.

32:54.915 --> 32:59.635
I can't say anything more now.
I'll give you his number.

32:59.715 --> 33:03.475
I'm turning my phone off. Bye.

33:05.475 --> 33:09.755
I'm fucked, they put me right in it.
They'll kill me.

33:09.835 --> 33:12.635
What the fuck have you done?

33:12.715 --> 33:17.435
Ciro Di Marzio told me to
kill someone. An important person.

33:17.515 --> 33:20.395
Quiet, I don't want to know.

33:22.795 --> 33:26.555
Help me, Bruno.
Do you have a place I can sleep?

33:26.635 --> 33:29.955
I don't want to get involved Danie.

33:32.275 --> 33:37.275
Do you remember my grandmother's place?
There's a tool shed.

33:37.355 --> 33:41.875
The key is on the door frame.
But only one night, okay?

33:41.955 --> 33:44.715
Thank you, Bruno.

33:44.795 --> 33:49.475
You didn't speak to me.
Not a word.

33:57.955 --> 34:02.275
There are currently
no contact to the subscriber.

34:29.675 --> 34:32.435
There is a new message...

35:04.155 --> 35:07.115
Bruno, it's Manu, Daniele's boyfriend.

35:07.195 --> 35:10.315
I'm waiting in front of Bar Italia.

36:32.195 --> 36:35.955
Bruno, where are you?
I'm still waiting.

36:41.115 --> 36:45.595
- Are you Manu, Daniele's girlfriend?
- Are you Bruno?

36:45.675 --> 36:48.795
Yes, I am. Jump in.

37:25.075 --> 37:28.355
Where is Daniele?

37:34.515 --> 37:37.595
Maybe you haven't understood the question.

37:40.235 --> 37:43.195
- Where's Daniele?
- I don't know.

37:43.275 --> 37:46.755
So I'll ask again.

37:46.835 --> 37:49.915
Where is Daniele?

37:51.155 --> 37:54.275
- I don't know.
- You do know.

37:57.315 --> 38:00.715
Of course you know.

38:00.795 --> 38:04.115
You know it. You know it.

38:09.355 --> 38:12.515
Where the hell is he?

38:15.355 --> 38:20.275
You want to go home? Yes or no?
Then where the hell is he?

38:31.955 --> 38:33.715
Where is he?

38:59.915 --> 39:03.155
- And Manu?
- I didn't find her there.

39:03.235 --> 39:07.675
- She didn't ring you?
- My phone went flat and she wasn't there.

39:09.595 --> 39:13.515
Danie, you need to get out of here.
I'm scared shitless.

39:18.395 --> 39:21.395
No one knows who it was?

39:21.475 --> 39:26.275
You're a bunch of idiots, all idiots.

39:26.355 --> 39:30.595
Find him and bring him to me.

39:33.835 --> 39:36.875
- What did they say?
- Fuck all.

39:40.715 --> 39:45.035
It must have been Gennaro Savastano.

39:47.955 --> 39:53.315
Send a wreath to the family
and check with the truck driver.

39:53.395 --> 39:55.515
- What's his name?
- Massimo.

39:55.595 --> 39:58.435
Yes, find him.

39:58.515 --> 40:01.515
Let's head back to Naples.

40:56.235 --> 41:00.075
Hi, this is Manu. I can't answer now.
Call me later.

41:17.635 --> 41:23.035
It looked like a revenge murder
for the Tonino Russo murder.

41:23.115 --> 41:28.395
But police have found
a charred corpse in the car

41:28.475 --> 41:32.715
of a woman possibly a very young girl.

41:32.795 --> 41:38.235
The victim's identity is not yet known.
And can only be identified

41:38.315 --> 41:44.075
by the presence of a diamond
ring inside the car.

41:44.155 --> 41:49.875
While trying to identify the charred body

41:49.955 --> 41:53.155
the police are questioning whether

41:53.235 --> 42:00.035
there is a correlation between the
murder of Russo and the charred corpse.

42:54.075 --> 42:58.275
I pray for strength to protect my family.

42:58.355 --> 43:03.435
I pray.
Hear my prayer, O Lord. Amen.

43:06.075 --> 43:09.595
Our Father who is in heaven.

43:11.875 --> 43:15.155
- Hello.
- Massimo. It's me.

43:15.235 --> 43:20.675
I can't speak now. I'm working.
Talk to you later. Bye.
