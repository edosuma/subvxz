00:01.004 --> 00:02.706
Previously on <i>Royal Pains</i>...

00:02.708 --> 00:04.207
Why didn't you tell Hank
that you're doing a shift

00:04.209 --> 00:05.909
- at the hospital?
- I was going to,

00:05.911 --> 00:07.611
but then I thought why burden him?

00:07.613 --> 00:09.913
So Friday, Nick & Toni's
going once, going twice,

00:09.915 --> 00:11.615
it's a date!

00:11.617 --> 00:13.483
He said, "it's a date."

00:13.485 --> 00:16.486
I made a list of internists in the area.

00:16.488 --> 00:19.489
Hank, we don't ever need
to talk about this again.

00:19.491 --> 00:21.124
Do you think you'll
be able to provide for Paige

00:21.126 --> 00:23.760
in the style to which she's accustomed?

00:23.762 --> 00:25.228
She's so gifted.

00:25.230 --> 00:26.863
I know. She's, like,
the best artist I've ever met.

00:26.865 --> 00:28.265
I'm glad you noticed.

00:28.267 --> 00:30.934
That's more than I can say
for her other boyfriends.

00:30.936 --> 00:32.869
Maybe you were right.

00:32.871 --> 00:34.938
Maybe I don't know her.

00:34.940 --> 00:38.108
Maybe I don't know her at all.

00:42.314 --> 00:44.815
I'll get it level for ya.

00:46.184 --> 00:47.818
Tables and chairs to the front lawn.

00:47.820 --> 00:49.353
- Thank you!
- Got it!

00:49.355 --> 00:51.488
All china to the kitchen for the caterers,

00:51.490 --> 00:53.924
and all stemware to the butler's pantry.

00:53.926 --> 00:57.661
On their way.

00:57.663 --> 01:00.030
These are gorgeous. And two days early.

01:00.032 --> 01:03.166
So I will see you then
with fresh flowers.

01:03.168 --> 01:04.501
The banner!

01:04.503 --> 01:06.536
- What do you think?
- It's perfect.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074

01:17.849 --> 01:20.984
You would not believe
the craziness downstairs.

01:20.986 --> 01:23.186
It feels like half the Hamptons

01:23.188 --> 01:24.421
is on our front lawn.

01:24.423 --> 01:25.655
Oh, and get this, mom.

01:25.657 --> 01:27.157
They tried to deliver
the flowers already.

01:27.159 --> 01:28.525
Can you believe it?

01:28.527 --> 01:30.260
I mean, we don't even start
staging the back yard

01:30.262 --> 01:31.595
until tomorrow.

01:31.597 --> 01:33.263
Don't worry. I sent them back.

01:33.265 --> 01:34.965
Daddy's fundraiser will be perfect.

01:34.967 --> 01:36.299
You always make sure of it.

01:36.301 --> 01:39.136
And I have the perfect outfit for you.

01:39.138 --> 01:41.471
Since you've been wearing
so much navy lately,

01:41.473 --> 01:44.808
I... I thought maybe
your red suit might be nice.

01:44.810 --> 01:46.143
What do you think?

01:46.145 --> 01:49.746
Mom?

01:56.954 --> 01:58.588
Oh, good morning, Henry, old chap.

01:58.590 --> 01:59.956
Good morning!

01:59.958 --> 02:01.324
I know you want to expand the business.

02:01.326 --> 02:03.260
I didn't realize that
included opening a bakery.

02:03.262 --> 02:04.594
- Ah-ah! These are for Paige.
- Ow.

02:04.596 --> 02:05.929
All right? She returns home tomorrow.

02:05.931 --> 02:07.497
These are gonna be wrapped and waiting.

02:07.499 --> 02:08.832
Really? Last I heard,

02:08.834 --> 02:10.199
you thought she was hiding something.

02:10.202 --> 02:11.501
You know what?

02:11.503 --> 02:12.869
Total misunderstanding.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.337
She wasn't hanging out
with that art dealer

02:14.339 --> 02:15.505
Kassabian dude.

02:15.507 --> 02:16.807
She was on a campaign trip.

02:16.809 --> 02:20.277
Oh, okay. Good.

02:20.279 --> 02:21.478
Look, I know what you're thinking.

02:21.480 --> 02:22.679
I'm not thinking anything.

02:22.681 --> 02:24.181
'Cause I had the exact same thought...

02:24.183 --> 02:25.816
why would the general call me
and ask where she was?

02:25.818 --> 02:27.417
Like, wouldn't he know
his own political schedule?

02:27.419 --> 02:28.618
And I wasn't thinking that.

02:28.620 --> 02:29.986
Well, she explained the whole thing to me.

02:29.988 --> 02:31.488
See, basically they have so many events

02:31.490 --> 02:32.989
and so many staffers running around

02:32.991 --> 02:34.357
trying to schedule those events,

02:34.359 --> 02:35.892
the general can't keep track of all that.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.060
The guy's kind of old.

02:37.062 --> 02:38.395
And after 5:00, a lot of the time

02:38.397 --> 02:39.796
he, uh, glug, glug, glug.

02:39.798 --> 02:41.064
"Oh, the war. Man, the war."

02:42.234 --> 02:43.467
Anyway, I'm making it up to her

02:43.469 --> 02:44.734
by baking her favorites.

02:44.736 --> 02:46.369
These are <i>biscochitos</i>

02:46.371 --> 02:48.104
and <i>choux a la creme.</i>

02:48.106 --> 02:49.573
Don't ever say that word
so close to my face,

02:49.575 --> 02:51.608
and I have no idea what those are.

02:51.610 --> 02:53.777
Mexican wedding cookies
and, uh, cream puffs.

02:53.779 --> 02:55.645
Created, by the way,
from the original recipes

02:55.647 --> 02:57.247
that her and her mom used
when she was little.

02:57.249 --> 02:59.149
They do look good.

02:59.151 --> 03:00.650
Yeah.

03:00.652 --> 03:02.719
They look perfect,

03:02.721 --> 03:04.454
just like Paige.

03:04.456 --> 03:07.991
Man, I'm awesome at this
engaged-to-be-engaged thing.

03:07.993 --> 03:09.826
Doit! Doit!

03:09.828 --> 03:12.829
Don't make that sound.

03:19.171 --> 03:20.604
Mom!

03:23.942 --> 03:25.408
May I help you, miss?

03:25.410 --> 03:27.544
It's okay. I got it. Thank you.

03:37.622 --> 03:39.155
Oh, my God.

03:42.327 --> 03:44.661
Your phone.

03:49.167 --> 03:51.034
This is Hank.

03:51.036 --> 03:54.004
How long ago?

03:54.006 --> 03:55.705
I'm on my way. Try not to move her,

03:55.707 --> 03:57.007
and call 9-1-1.

03:57.009 --> 03:58.275
What happened?

03:58.277 --> 04:00.110
Someone's had a fall.

04:00.112 --> 04:01.444
Well, was it a potential retainer?

04:01.446 --> 04:02.612
Should I come?

04:02.614 --> 04:04.281
No, it's okay. I got this one.

04:04.283 --> 04:06.283
All right.

04:29.701 --> 04:33.101

04:36.708 --> 04:37.774
Okay.

04:37.776 --> 04:39.109
I got here before the paramedics?

04:39.111 --> 04:42.112
- I never called 9-1-1.
- Why not?

04:42.114 --> 04:43.813
I didn't wanna involve them.

04:43.815 --> 04:46.483
Involve them in what?

04:48.018 --> 04:49.018
Ooh!

04:57.695 --> 04:59.529
Ohh!

04:59.531 --> 05:01.531
Okay. Okay.

05:01.533 --> 05:03.967
Okay, no major bones
are broken or dislocated.

05:03.969 --> 05:05.802
So other than your left foot,
which may be fractured,

05:05.804 --> 05:07.203
and some minor cuts and abrasions,

05:07.205 --> 05:08.872
you seem okay.

05:08.874 --> 05:11.074
To be safe, I want you
to have X-rays and a head C.T.

05:11.076 --> 05:12.609
It was just a silly fall.

05:12.611 --> 05:14.010
And you said she was fine.

05:14.012 --> 05:18.448
Yeah, and I wanna be certain.

05:18.450 --> 05:19.783
You're cold.

05:19.785 --> 05:21.851
Um, she needs a blanket. Can you...

05:21.853 --> 05:23.553
Okay, I'm gonna be right back.

05:23.555 --> 05:24.854
I promise.

05:24.856 --> 05:26.890
Thanks.

05:28.959 --> 05:33.229
Don't worry. This won't take long.

05:33.231 --> 05:34.664
- Here we go.
- Ohh!

05:34.666 --> 05:36.499
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

05:36.501 --> 05:38.234
Oh, boy. Mm.

05:38.236 --> 05:40.470
Do you always walk so early, Ellen?

05:40.472 --> 05:41.971
Sometimes.

05:41.973 --> 05:45.809
Well, it was a beautiful morning.

05:45.811 --> 05:47.744
Seems like you have a lot on your mind.

05:47.746 --> 05:51.748
What's on your mind now?

05:51.750 --> 05:54.784
Maybe you're thinking about
that party that's being set up

05:54.786 --> 05:57.654
on the front lawn.

05:57.656 --> 05:59.189
Now that your husband's
running for office,

05:59.191 --> 06:01.057
I bet you attend a lot of events.

06:01.059 --> 06:05.328
My husband's campaign
is very important to him.

06:05.330 --> 06:07.430
Winning will make him happy.

06:07.432 --> 06:10.500
What about your happiness?

06:12.703 --> 06:15.705
When was the last time you felt happy?

06:15.707 --> 06:18.741
I don't know.

06:18.743 --> 06:20.276
It's complicated.

06:20.278 --> 06:21.611
Maybe we could have you
speak with someone

06:21.613 --> 06:23.479
who specializes in these sorts of things.

06:24.883 --> 06:27.283
I'm not crazy, if that's
what you're thinking.

06:27.285 --> 06:29.786
I don't think you're crazy,

06:29.788 --> 06:31.487
but I'm worried about you.

06:31.489 --> 06:34.090
Okay.

06:45.936 --> 06:47.670
You look a bit tired. Late night?

06:47.672 --> 06:49.038
Early morning. House call.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.373
I had to get somebody to the hospital.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.608
Well, you should've called me.

06:51.610 --> 06:52.842
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

06:52.844 --> 06:54.177
The patient is stable and resting.

06:54.179 --> 06:55.678
Anything I can do to help?

06:55.680 --> 06:56.813
Remind me again who we're seeing.

06:56.815 --> 07:00.049
Simon Field. Age six. Asthmatic.

07:00.051 --> 07:01.351
His nanny is watching him

07:01.353 --> 07:03.820
while his actor parents
are in Beijing for the month

07:03.822 --> 07:07.023
filming the sequel
to their movie <i>The Fearfuls.</i>

07:07.025 --> 07:09.926
- You mean <i>The Fearlesses</i> ?
- Oh, that's it.

07:09.928 --> 07:11.594
"In a world gripped by fear,

07:11.596 --> 07:13.463
only two stand unafraid."

07:13.465 --> 07:15.098
Why are you talking like that?

07:15.100 --> 07:17.467
Because... wait, tell me
you've seen <i>The Fearlesses</i>.

07:17.469 --> 07:19.202
Tell me you've heard of <i>The Fearlesses.</i>

07:19.204 --> 07:20.737
Impossibly good-looking superheroes

07:20.739 --> 07:23.106
who are afraid of nothing,
with the silver hair?

07:23.108 --> 07:24.607
Okay, you need to get out more.

07:25.977 --> 07:27.310
Or you hang around Evan too much.

07:29.648 --> 07:32.882
People of Hankmed, hello!

07:32.884 --> 07:34.050
Hello!

07:34.052 --> 07:35.351
You must be Toby Thompson.

07:35.353 --> 07:37.053
That would be me. The nanny.

07:37.055 --> 07:38.955
Although right now
I'm Toby The Terrifying.

07:38.957 --> 07:39.956
See?

07:39.958 --> 07:41.124
Aah!

07:42.661 --> 07:44.360
Did you guys bring Simon a new nebulizer?

07:44.362 --> 07:46.362
Yep, and a refill of his medicine.

07:46.364 --> 07:48.631
Oh. That will be a problem.

07:48.633 --> 07:51.401
Simon's never used a machine
with a mask before.

07:51.403 --> 07:53.069
We prefer it. It delivers the medicine

07:53.071 --> 07:55.004
without having to hold a mouthpiece.

07:55.006 --> 07:56.472
Yeah, Divya's right, but if you want,

07:56.474 --> 07:58.207
we can get him a pediatric mouthpiece.

07:58.209 --> 08:00.376
No, no, it's... it's okay.

08:00.378 --> 08:02.345
Simon needs to learn
not to be afraid of new things.

08:02.347 --> 08:04.180
Oh! One more thing.

08:04.182 --> 08:07.183
Simon's a little frightened of,
well, everything.

08:07.185 --> 08:08.651
Uh, but we're working on his fears,

08:08.653 --> 08:10.486
so he might try to scare you.

08:10.488 --> 08:11.688
Oh, okay.

08:14.158 --> 08:15.959
- Aah!
- Aah!

08:15.961 --> 08:17.026
Help me!

08:17.028 --> 08:18.294
Help me, Simon!

08:18.296 --> 08:21.164
I am drowning in quicksand.
Please help me.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.933
- He did say "please".
- Okay!

08:23.935 --> 08:26.569
Oh, if I could just reach
the top of the quicksand.

08:26.571 --> 08:28.071
Yes!

08:28.073 --> 08:31.407
Thank you, Knight Of
The Silver Plastic Sword.

08:31.409 --> 08:33.842
See, Simon? You're not
the only one who gets scared.

08:33.845 --> 08:35.144
You can be the scary one too.

08:35.145 --> 08:36.412
Good work.

08:36.414 --> 08:38.948
But you really gotta pick up your toys.

08:38.950 --> 08:41.517
Oh, uh, can he do that
after I check out his lungs?

08:41.519 --> 08:43.052
Sure. Thanks for asking.

08:43.054 --> 08:44.721
Sure.

08:44.723 --> 08:47.056
This is my super-duper magnet.

08:47.058 --> 08:49.459
She goes first.

08:51.028 --> 08:53.329
- I go first a lot.
- Oh, okay.

08:53.331 --> 08:54.897
Uh, can you turn around, please?

08:54.899 --> 08:56.366
Okay.

08:56.368 --> 08:57.900
Deep breath in.

08:57.902 --> 09:00.403
And again.

09:02.607 --> 09:04.240
You see? It's nothing.

09:04.242 --> 09:06.175
Mm-mm!

09:32.369 --> 09:33.770
So good news.

09:33.772 --> 09:35.438
I hear your mom has no internal injuries

09:35.440 --> 09:37.006
and her C.T. came back clean.

09:37.008 --> 09:39.008
Yeah. They just wanna hold her

09:39.010 --> 09:41.544
for observation and pain control.

09:41.546 --> 09:44.113
Yeah. What about her psych evaluation?

09:44.115 --> 09:47.016
The psychiatrist wants
to come back when she wakes,

09:47.018 --> 09:50.286
but... I'm afraid she won't wanna stay.

09:50.288 --> 09:53.022
She may not have a choice.

09:53.024 --> 09:55.625
She was walking in her nightgown

09:55.627 --> 09:57.794
toward the ocean.

09:57.796 --> 09:59.796
I'm worried, and I think you are too,

09:59.798 --> 10:01.130
about what she might've done

10:01.132 --> 10:03.132
if she hadn't fallen down the stairs,

10:03.134 --> 10:06.002
if she made it to the beach.

10:06.004 --> 10:08.538
That's why you were running
after her, isn't it?

10:12.976 --> 10:15.912
She's suffered from
major depressive disorder

10:15.914 --> 10:18.314
since before I was born.

10:18.316 --> 10:21.350
Over the years, she's tried
a lot of different things.

10:21.352 --> 10:23.519
Lately her depression
seems to have deepened,

10:23.521 --> 10:27.256
and she struggles now
from dawn until late afternoon.

10:27.258 --> 10:29.592
Yeah, it's a symptom
of severe depression...

10:29.594 --> 10:30.993
diurnal variation.

10:30.995 --> 10:33.563
Yeah, she... she feels calm
in the late afternoon,

10:33.565 --> 10:35.131
but restless at night,

10:35.133 --> 10:37.433
and horrible in the morning.

10:37.435 --> 10:41.037
When was the last time she saw a doctor?

10:41.039 --> 10:42.538
Eight months ago.

10:42.540 --> 10:45.408
It was a military doctor,
a friend of the family.

10:45.410 --> 10:48.478
- Your dad's idea?
- No, my mom's.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.879
She worried that her illness

10:49.881 --> 10:52.715
would somehow hold back my dad's career,

10:52.717 --> 10:55.551
and he wanted nothing more
than to protect her,

10:55.553 --> 10:57.386
so he agreed.

10:57.388 --> 10:58.721
That's what you approached me about

10:58.723 --> 11:00.189
earlier this summer.

11:00.191 --> 11:01.491
Yeah.

11:01.493 --> 11:03.192
I couldn't tell you the truth,

11:03.194 --> 11:04.494
or anyone.

11:04.496 --> 11:07.029
It just wasn't my secret to tell.

11:08.031 --> 11:09.332
But now that it's out,

11:09.334 --> 11:10.800
I'll tell Evan.

11:10.802 --> 11:12.201
I've really wanted to.

11:12.203 --> 11:14.137
Yeah, he thinks you're out of town.

11:14.139 --> 11:15.972
When, uh...

11:15.974 --> 11:17.507
when my mom's having a hard time

11:17.509 --> 11:21.077
and she needs me,
I... I say that sometimes.

11:21.079 --> 11:23.246
It's just the easiest lie to remember.

11:30.721 --> 11:32.588
Okay, Simon, I have a question.

11:32.590 --> 11:35.258
What color comes out of the evil
Dr. Toxin's power sword?

11:35.260 --> 11:36.425
Yellow.

11:36.427 --> 11:38.728
And who defeated Dr. Toxin?

11:38.730 --> 11:40.363
My dad.

11:40.365 --> 11:42.431
Mr. Fearless. That's right.

11:42.433 --> 11:45.368
But now it's your turn to be the hero.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.703
Picture this mask making you strong,

11:47.705 --> 11:49.539
superhero strong.

11:49.541 --> 11:51.641
With every breath of medicine in,

11:51.643 --> 11:54.177
I'll remove one of these
pieces of yellow ribbon,

11:54.179 --> 11:56.479
and Dr. Toxin
will lose some of his power,

11:56.481 --> 11:58.014
until they're all gone,

11:58.016 --> 12:00.049
the citizens of Earth are free,

12:00.051 --> 12:03.886
and you're no longer wheezing.

12:03.888 --> 12:05.988
You first.

12:07.524 --> 12:09.192
Hi. Mom, I just wanna let you know

12:09.194 --> 12:12.061
that I packed you a bag,
and I'm on my way back,

12:12.063 --> 12:14.530
and I'm so proud of you for staying.

12:14.532 --> 12:17.400
All right. I love you too. Bye.

12:22.573 --> 12:24.240
Evan.

12:24.242 --> 12:26.309
Hi.

12:26.311 --> 12:28.144
When did you get back?

12:28.146 --> 12:29.812
Uh, just a little while ago.

12:29.814 --> 12:31.480
What are you doing here?

12:31.482 --> 12:33.616
I'm just delivering a surprise.

12:33.618 --> 12:36.352
But now it looks like
the surprise is on me.

12:36.354 --> 12:38.454
No, you know, this actually isn't even...

12:38.456 --> 12:39.822
What it looks like?

12:39.824 --> 12:41.457
No, I'm sure. I'm sure it's not.

12:41.459 --> 12:43.392
No, it's not, not at all.

12:43.394 --> 12:45.194
- So what is it then?
- Okay, um,

12:45.196 --> 12:48.464
I wasn't expecting
to get into this right now.

12:48.466 --> 12:51.133
Um...

12:54.238 --> 12:55.905
Okay, I guess from...

12:55.907 --> 12:58.541
Was there a campaign trip?

12:58.543 --> 13:00.409
No.

13:00.411 --> 13:02.878
Did you even leave town?

13:02.880 --> 13:04.847
No, but...

13:04.849 --> 13:07.984
So you lied to me.

13:07.986 --> 13:09.852
This isn't the first time, is it?

13:09.854 --> 13:11.320
No. But, Evan, please let me expl...

13:11.322 --> 13:12.989
Who is it? Is it Eric Kassabian?

13:12.991 --> 13:14.523
What?

13:14.525 --> 13:16.459
You're obviously seeing someone, Paige.

13:16.461 --> 13:19.262
God, it sure explains all
the last-minute trips

13:19.264 --> 13:21.364
- and the secret phone calls.
- You think I'm cheating on you?

13:21.366 --> 13:23.199
I should've seen this.

13:23.201 --> 13:25.201
When I met you,
you were lying to your parents

13:25.203 --> 13:28.204
and your boyfriend.

13:28.206 --> 13:30.673
You've got me all figured out.

13:30.675 --> 13:32.775
- So now what?
- You tell me, Paige.

13:32.777 --> 13:34.010
You love telling stories.

13:34.012 --> 13:35.544
But, actually, they're not stories at all.

13:35.546 --> 13:39.715
- They're just lies.
- You know what? Forget it.

13:39.717 --> 13:42.518
We're over.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.854
Done.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.612
Your mom and dad are very excited

14:08.614 --> 14:09.880
to Skype with you.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.384
Here. Why don't you
take it into the shade

14:13.386 --> 14:14.585
so you can see better?

14:16.589 --> 14:18.923
<i>Lai zi Beijing de wenhou.</i>

14:18.925 --> 14:20.524
How do I say it again?

14:20.526 --> 14:23.427
<i>Xi de mama he ba ba.</i>

14:23.429 --> 14:25.596
<i>Xi de mama he ba ba,</i>

14:25.598 --> 14:27.698
which means "Hello, mum and dad."

14:27.700 --> 14:29.166
- Oh, sweetheart!
- Hi, Simon!

14:29.168 --> 14:30.601
Hello! How are you?

14:30.603 --> 14:33.370
Oh, you look so good! You look older.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.372
- <i>Xi de, Hank.</i>
- <i>Xi de, Simon.</i>

14:35.374 --> 14:36.707
- Have you grown?
- Oh, darling.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.043
- Of course he's grown.
- His parents adore him.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.411
They're just on location a lot.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.779
And let's face it...

14:41.781 --> 14:43.113
the last place you wanna
take a kid with asthma

14:43.115 --> 14:44.882
is the air pollution capital of the world.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.784
So is Simon okay?

14:46.786 --> 14:48.519
Oh, yeah, he's fine.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.020
I'm actually the one
that needs medical attention.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.255
Oh.

14:51.257 --> 14:54.225
Last night I tripped
on fire engine Freddy,

14:54.227 --> 14:58.762
and I must've hit my head
when I fell to the floor.

14:58.764 --> 15:01.131
I like the bobby-pin bandage.

15:01.133 --> 15:02.666
I did what I could.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.237
Yeah, you definitely need stitches.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.838
Ugh.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.440
Are you behaving for Toby?

15:09.442 --> 15:10.975
Can you do it quickly?

15:10.977 --> 15:12.343
Sure. I won't even numb it.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.744
Maybe not that quickly.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.456
So how long have you been Simon's nanny?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.558
Uh, about seven months,

15:27.560 --> 15:29.193
since I finished N.Y.U.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.394
Okay.

15:30.396 --> 15:31.829
Try to keep it clean and dry.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.697
He seems to really like you.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.633
Hi-yah! Wee!

15:35.635 --> 15:37.201
Hi! Wee!

15:37.203 --> 15:38.536
Hi! Wee!

15:38.538 --> 15:40.004
He makes it easy.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.472
I'm gonna really miss him

15:41.474 --> 15:43.641
when he goes away
to boarding school in the fall.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.643
- Mm.
- But until then,

15:45.645 --> 15:48.412
I'm staying focused on
helping him overcome his fears.

15:48.414 --> 15:51.081
You can't believe the progress
that he's made so far, really.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.316
Mm.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.818
Go on in, Simon! You can do it!

15:57.422 --> 15:58.722
Ohh!

15:58.724 --> 16:00.357
That's so good.

16:00.359 --> 16:02.026
Trust me, that is progress.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.827
Okay, okay.

16:33.725 --> 16:35.559
What the hell are you doing?

16:35.561 --> 16:38.228
It's a golf exercise for the angry.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.531
I happen to be very angry...

16:40.533 --> 16:42.066
sir.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.734
Can I help you?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.302
Where's your brother?

16:46.304 --> 16:47.571
Why?

16:47.573 --> 16:49.306
I need to talk to him.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.175
He's not here right now.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.376
Are you sick?

16:52.378 --> 16:53.877
Do I look sick?

16:53.879 --> 16:55.179
No, you just look kind of angry.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.147
Just give your brother a message.

16:57.149 --> 16:58.916
You tell him he had no right

16:58.918 --> 17:00.751
to take my wife to the hospital,

17:00.753 --> 17:04.188
then try and force her
into a psychiatric hold!

17:04.190 --> 17:05.388
What?

17:05.391 --> 17:07.124
You tell him I brought Ellen home,

17:07.126 --> 17:08.525
and she's not going back.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.928
And if she needs a doctor,

17:10.930 --> 17:12.396
I will find her one!

17:12.397 --> 17:13.564
Needs... wait... wait a minute.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.467
So Hank saw Mrs. Collins?

17:16.469 --> 17:17.701
He treated her?

17:17.703 --> 17:19.670
After Paige called him, yes.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.173
Paige called?
When... when did she call him?

17:23.175 --> 17:24.974
Early yesterday.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.577
Don't you work with your brother?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.212
How could you not know this?

17:28.214 --> 17:29.847
Yeah, that's a very good question, sir.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.415
Now, when you see him you can ask him,

17:31.417 --> 17:34.718
but first tell him
to stay out of our business

17:34.720 --> 17:36.487
and off my property.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.523
I...

17:42.227 --> 17:45.696
'Cause that's what <i>I</i> do when <i>I'm</i> angry.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.737
Oh, my goodness.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.939
What have you done?

17:57.776 --> 17:59.943
Uh, I was in a hurry to clean up my gear

17:59.945 --> 18:01.245
before the Mets game started.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.048
Do you mind? 25 years,
never missed an inning.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.083
- Wait for a good pitch.
- Okay.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.386
And now I won't either. Lucky me.

18:09.388 --> 18:10.621
Hey.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.389
Hey.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.224
When can you talk?

18:14.226 --> 18:16.894
Uh, well, now's good.

18:18.163 --> 18:22.833
Trust me, he can't hear a thing.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.669
Oh, what do you mean?
He missed the bag by a mile!

18:25.671 --> 18:27.438
What's up?

18:27.440 --> 18:31.075
I am dying to hear about
your plans with Van Dyke.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.210
There aren't going to be any plans.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.913
I have decided to cancel our date.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.514
Cancel? Why?

18:37.516 --> 18:38.816
All he does is talk about himself,

18:38.818 --> 18:41.318
and that's in a hospital full of people.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.320
I'll be stuck. Alone.

18:44.422 --> 18:45.789
You're nervous.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.858
I am not.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.460
How could you not be?

18:49.462 --> 18:52.296
You've only been with one guy
since you were what, 13?

18:52.298 --> 18:53.630
11.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.699
Think of this evening as...

18:55.701 --> 18:57.334
social training wheels,

18:57.336 --> 18:59.002
a quick dip back in the dating pool.

18:59.004 --> 19:00.270
Have a glass of wine at dinner

19:00.272 --> 19:01.605
and try to have fun.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.941
Score! Score!

19:03.943 --> 19:05.609
Katdare, I'll pick you up at 7:00.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.010
About that.

19:07.012 --> 19:08.512
Oh, make that 6:00.

19:08.514 --> 19:09.747
Did you say something?

19:09.749 --> 19:11.348
Yes. I wanted to tell you...

19:11.350 --> 19:14.251
Training wheels. Tiny dip.

19:17.021 --> 19:18.455
I'll see you at 6:00.

19:18.457 --> 19:21.859
- Yes!
- Oh, and don't do fancy hair.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.427
Why not?

19:23.429 --> 19:25.329
'Cause it's the law. Good-bye.

19:33.973 --> 19:38.175
Whoa.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.511
Trying to tell me something?

19:40.513 --> 19:41.945
No.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.847
General Collins
has a message for you, though.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.650
He said stay the hell away.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.218
- What?
- Yeah, he stopped by

19:48.220 --> 19:50.387
after taking his wife home
from Hamptons Heritage.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.022
No, no, no, no, Ellen shouldn't be home.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.957
She should still be
under supervised care.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.692
Oh, really?

19:55.694 --> 19:56.960
'Cause you just always know
what's best for everyone,

19:56.962 --> 19:58.495
don't you?

19:58.497 --> 20:00.097
Has Paige talked to you?

20:00.099 --> 20:02.432
Why would she talk to me
when she can talk to you?

20:02.434 --> 20:04.601
The only thing I know for sure right now

20:04.603 --> 20:08.338
is that Ellen Collins was
clearly yesterday's emergency.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.807
I wanted to tell you.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.909
You have no idea how badly I wanted to.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.177
When we were in Florida, I tried...

20:13.179 --> 20:15.479
Florida?

20:15.481 --> 20:16.780
How long have you known?

20:16.782 --> 20:18.248
I wasn't sure about anything
until yesterday

20:18.250 --> 20:19.550
when Paige called for help,

20:19.552 --> 20:21.451
but I've been hinting for weeks.

20:21.453 --> 20:24.054
Oh, you've been hinting? You don't hint.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.290
This... this is not a game.
This is my life.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.359
Evan, you're right. It's not a game.

20:29.361 --> 20:31.829
But I'm bound by
doctor-patient confidentiality...

20:31.831 --> 20:33.130
Do not pull that doctor crap.

20:33.132 --> 20:34.665
I'm your brother!

20:34.667 --> 20:37.034
Nothing is more important than family.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.136
I took an oath. My patients trust...

20:39.138 --> 20:40.637
Oh, your patients?
You wouldn't even have patients

20:40.639 --> 20:42.105
if it wasn't for me.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.308
If I hadn't pick you up
off the floor in Brooklyn

20:44.310 --> 20:46.677
and dusted you off,
you'd be by yourself right now

20:46.679 --> 20:48.178
in a dark room!

20:48.180 --> 20:52.182
And now because of you...

20:52.184 --> 20:53.817
Paige broke up with me.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.152
What?

20:55.154 --> 20:57.054
Yeah, we're done. We're done. Her words.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.990
Ev, I...

20:59.992 --> 21:01.525
I'm so sorry.

21:01.527 --> 21:04.928
You ruined it for me.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.197
- Ev.
- You ruined it!

21:11.135 --> 21:13.871
You should've told me
the moment you knew.

21:15.740 --> 21:17.875
That's what I would've done for you.

21:26.382 --> 21:28.115
I wanted to tell him, you know,

21:28.117 --> 21:29.683
from the first time Paige said anything.

21:29.685 --> 21:31.185
It was an impossible situation.

21:31.187 --> 21:32.553
I haven't kept a secret from him

21:32.555 --> 21:35.122
since I broke his Han Solo
and blamed the dog.

21:35.124 --> 21:37.491
Well, that must've been hard for you, Evan,

21:37.493 --> 21:40.160
and Han Solo.

21:40.162 --> 21:42.830
But, Hank, I mean, you took an oath.

21:42.832 --> 21:45.733
He's my brother.
I mean, what was I thinking?

21:45.735 --> 21:48.569
And I hate secrets.
I mean, they never end well.

21:48.571 --> 21:51.071
Evan doesn't forgive easily, but he did,

21:51.073 --> 21:52.640
and he will now too.

21:52.642 --> 21:54.308
Just give him some time.

21:54.310 --> 21:56.310
He knows that you love him,
and he'll realize

21:56.312 --> 21:58.178
that you were in a complicated position...

21:58.180 --> 21:59.847
Yeah. No, Evan likes things simple.

21:59.849 --> 22:01.181
Yes. But he has got to see

22:01.183 --> 22:03.517
that things can't always be simple.

22:03.519 --> 22:06.887
Sometimes we keep secrets
for a very good reason.

22:06.889 --> 22:09.823
Hopefully you're right.

22:19.501 --> 22:21.001
Feel better?

22:21.003 --> 22:23.170
I feel better because it's over.

22:23.172 --> 22:24.505
Aw.

22:24.507 --> 22:27.541
Okay, ready?

22:27.543 --> 22:29.610
Do we have to?

22:29.612 --> 22:31.645
Simon, I promise swimming is so fun.

22:31.647 --> 22:33.047
And when you learn to swim,

22:33.049 --> 22:35.516
you get to jump off the diving board!

22:35.518 --> 22:38.018
I don't want to jump off anything.

22:38.020 --> 22:41.155
But the cool thing about diving boards

22:41.157 --> 22:42.923
is you get to feel like you're flying.

22:42.925 --> 22:46.060
Like superman, soaring through the air.

22:46.062 --> 22:50.431
- Ready? You go one, two...
- You first.

22:50.433 --> 22:52.032
Aah!

22:58.607 --> 23:00.441
Toby.

23:00.443 --> 23:02.976
Toby, stop.

23:02.978 --> 23:05.245
Toby! Are you okay?

23:36.978 --> 23:39.446
Simon, get my phone!

23:42.284 --> 23:43.550
Deep breath in.

23:43.552 --> 23:46.386
And out.

23:46.388 --> 23:48.021
Seems clear.

23:48.023 --> 23:51.425
No rattling, but I'd still like
to do some follow-up tests.

23:51.427 --> 23:53.260
Toby is gonna be okay.

23:53.262 --> 23:54.995
Thanks to you, Simon.

23:54.997 --> 23:57.498
My brave little aquaman.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.533
Simon, The Knight Of
The Silver Plastic Sword

23:59.535 --> 24:01.068
needs a fort.

24:01.070 --> 24:02.703
Do you think you could use
those cushions over there

24:02.705 --> 24:04.104
- to build one?
- Okay.

24:04.106 --> 24:06.039
- Okay.
- Go for it.

24:09.177 --> 24:12.212
So the E.K.G. didn't show
anything conclusive.

24:12.214 --> 24:14.848
That's never good.
We like conclusive, huh?

24:14.850 --> 24:17.251
Toby, the other night,

24:17.253 --> 24:18.619
could you have fainted

24:18.621 --> 24:20.087
before you tripped over the toy?

24:20.089 --> 24:22.756
No, I don't think so.

24:22.758 --> 24:24.691
Why? Do you think that's related to this?

24:24.693 --> 24:27.127
It may be. So I'd like
to rule out arrhythmias

24:27.129 --> 24:28.729
and neurological issues.

24:28.731 --> 24:30.063
Not as much as I would.

24:30.065 --> 24:31.398
Right. I'll make you an appointment

24:31.400 --> 24:32.800
with a cardiologist.

24:32.802 --> 24:34.968
But until I figure out
what's causing you to faint,

24:34.970 --> 24:36.737
I can't leave you alone with Simon.

24:36.739 --> 24:39.206
Oh, well, Marilyn,
the family housekeeper,

24:39.208 --> 24:41.241
is coming in tonight from the city, so...

24:41.243 --> 24:43.310
Oh. Then I'll stay until she gets here.

24:43.312 --> 24:45.212
Wow!

24:45.214 --> 24:48.348
Doctor by day, babysitter by night, huh?

24:48.350 --> 24:50.284
It's super Hank!

24:50.286 --> 24:52.152
I like to multi-task.

24:52.154 --> 24:53.854
You, on the other hand, need to rest,

24:53.856 --> 24:56.089
so I'm gonna put you on a monitor.

24:56.091 --> 24:58.492
A monitor, okay. Rest, not so much.

24:58.494 --> 25:01.128
It's pizza night. Me and Simon
go out for the works.

25:01.130 --> 25:02.396
Hey, I have plans with a friend tonight,

25:02.398 --> 25:04.064
so what if I had her
bring over some pizza?

25:04.066 --> 25:05.399
The works.

25:05.401 --> 25:08.235
Hank, Simon needs me.

25:08.237 --> 25:12.139
I can't get sick right now.

25:12.141 --> 25:14.608
I made promises to him.

25:15.844 --> 25:19.112
This goes right on top...

25:36.397 --> 25:38.732
Uh! Helmet head.

25:38.734 --> 25:40.667
Not much you can do about it.
Might as well own it.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.536
- Own it?
- Yeah.

25:42.538 --> 25:45.038
Wear it like a badge of honor.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.041
Like the slight engine burn
on the inside of my right calf?

25:48.043 --> 25:50.577
Well, you shouldn't have worn a skirt.

25:53.415 --> 25:56.316
Had I known that tonight's
mode of transportation

25:56.318 --> 25:59.019
was a motorcycle,
I certainly wouldn't have.

25:59.021 --> 26:01.054
You didn't take me
for the biker type, huh?

26:01.056 --> 26:02.890
Ha!

26:02.892 --> 26:04.892
That's why I ride, Katdare.

26:04.894 --> 26:09.096
It surprises people.
It's what the V.D. is all about.

26:09.098 --> 26:10.898
V.D.'s for Van Dyke, not...

26:10.900 --> 26:12.266
Got it.

26:16.305 --> 26:17.738
Can you believe that people
actually wait in line

26:17.740 --> 26:19.840
to have their ear drums perforated?

26:19.842 --> 26:21.675
Hey, good to see you again, buddy.

26:21.677 --> 26:23.243
There you go.

26:23.245 --> 26:24.578
Go right in.

26:24.580 --> 26:27.080
Where are you going? What about dinner?

26:27.082 --> 26:29.983
I wanna work up an appetite.

26:29.985 --> 26:31.051
Her too.

26:31.053 --> 26:32.252
You got it.

26:42.897 --> 26:45.766
I'm so sorry.

26:45.768 --> 26:47.234
I shouldn't have lied to you.

26:47.236 --> 26:48.769
I can't believe I lied to you.

26:48.771 --> 26:50.103
It's okay. I know
why you did it, all right?

26:50.105 --> 26:51.738
I get it. Just, please,
let's just not keep secrets

26:51.740 --> 26:53.040
from each other ever.

26:53.042 --> 26:56.076
Ever.

27:03.751 --> 27:05.085
Knight Of The Silver Plastic Sword,

27:05.087 --> 27:06.520
I will find you,

27:06.522 --> 27:09.156
for I am The Knight
Of The Red Foam Tomahawk!

27:09.158 --> 27:10.490
I got you!

27:10.492 --> 27:12.826
And now I must eat you.

27:14.163 --> 27:16.229
Okay, kiddo,

27:16.231 --> 27:19.900
it's time for your treatment
and sleep, okay?

27:19.902 --> 27:21.401
Don't worry. We'll clean all this up.

27:21.403 --> 27:23.570
Thanks. Thank Jill for the pizza.

27:23.572 --> 27:25.205
Thank Jill for the pizza.

27:25.207 --> 27:27.174
You're welcome, Simon. Good night.

27:27.176 --> 27:29.042
- Good night.
- Good night!

27:31.213 --> 27:32.980
Oh, he's a real cutie.

27:32.982 --> 27:35.082
And she's like a comic-con Mary Poppins.

27:35.084 --> 27:36.750
- Yup! Ha!
- Ow!

27:36.752 --> 27:40.120
I will find you!

27:40.122 --> 27:41.722
I'm sorry our dinner out

27:41.724 --> 27:44.191
turned into a night
of pizza and babysitting.

27:44.193 --> 27:46.059
You know I love a good game of charades.

27:46.061 --> 27:47.694
Well, thank you for coming over.

27:47.696 --> 27:49.062
You're welcome.

27:49.064 --> 27:51.598
I mean, it's not like I
didn't have an ulterior motive.

27:51.600 --> 27:55.435
Wait, what was your...

28:00.408 --> 28:02.242
So when's this housekeeper getting back?

28:02.244 --> 28:03.877
I was just thinking the same thing.

28:03.879 --> 28:05.545
Oh, were you?

28:08.751 --> 28:10.384
Hey, I'll check the back door.

28:10.386 --> 28:12.419
- Yeah, good.
- Okay.

28:17.793 --> 28:20.794
Hey, the...

28:23.965 --> 28:27.234
Toby! Toby!

28:39.414 --> 28:41.148
Jill, I need my bag

28:41.150 --> 28:42.816
and the zoll monitor from my car.

28:42.818 --> 28:45.118
And call 9-1-1.

28:45.120 --> 28:48.655
Hey, it's okay.

28:55.246 --> 28:56.480
I can't get a pulse.

28:56.482 --> 28:58.515
Paramedics are on their way.

28:58.517 --> 28:59.850
E.T.A. seven minutes.

28:59.852 --> 29:02.286
Toby may not have that much time.

29:06.558 --> 29:08.392
Jill, take over chest compressions.

29:17.869 --> 29:19.069
Okay, stop compressions.

29:20.906 --> 29:22.973
She's in V-fib. Start again.

29:30.582 --> 29:33.650
Okay. Clear!

29:37.523 --> 29:39.223
Nothing.

29:39.225 --> 29:41.658
Clear!

29:44.229 --> 29:45.929
Damn it.

29:45.931 --> 29:47.397
She's in torsades.

29:47.399 --> 29:49.066
That's why the defibrillator didn't work.

29:49.068 --> 29:52.102
Continue compressions.

29:52.104 --> 29:53.437
What is torsades?

29:53.439 --> 29:55.038
Torsades de pointes.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.940
It's an arrhythmia that
can't be stopped with paddles.

29:56.942 --> 29:58.508
Shocking her only knocks her
into sinus rhythm

29:58.510 --> 30:00.043
for a few moments.

30:00.045 --> 30:01.778
I need you to continue C.P.R.

30:01.780 --> 30:03.647
until I inject her with magnesium.

30:05.950 --> 30:08.518
Okay.

30:15.060 --> 30:17.361
Hi.

30:17.363 --> 30:18.962
What happened?

30:18.964 --> 30:20.430
Okay, we need to get you to a hospital.

30:20.432 --> 30:22.266
No. Simon...

30:22.268 --> 30:24.301
Toby, don't worry. I'll stay with him.

30:24.303 --> 30:26.603
Thank you. It's gonna be okay.

30:26.605 --> 30:28.105
It's okay.

30:28.107 --> 30:30.440
- I'll meet the paramedics.
- Good.

30:42.587 --> 30:44.087
Martini, rocks.

30:44.089 --> 30:46.123
Apple-tini, straight.

30:46.125 --> 30:49.626
There are two words you
don't hear together very often.

30:49.628 --> 30:53.263
Oh, my God, I love this song.

30:53.265 --> 30:54.698
Look, we just got our drinks.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.333
I don't need alcohol to have fun.

30:56.335 --> 30:58.802
Neither do I.

30:58.804 --> 31:00.137
Tsk.

31:00.139 --> 31:02.673
But it sure helps.

31:20.658 --> 31:23.393
Whoa! Wh-whoa!

31:24.462 --> 31:26.163
Oh, hey, hey, hey, do you surf?

31:26.165 --> 31:27.464
No. No, and even if I did,

31:27.466 --> 31:29.599
I don't wanna look like a complete idiot.

31:29.601 --> 31:31.134
Says the woman with helmet head.

31:31.136 --> 31:32.536
Fine, I'll go.

31:43.648 --> 31:45.816
Whoa.

31:49.722 --> 31:52.122
Whoa. Whoa! Whoa!

31:53.291 --> 31:54.992
Ohh! Ohh!

31:54.994 --> 31:56.626
Ohh!

31:58.029 --> 31:59.730
Hey, Dr. Van Dyke!

31:59.732 --> 32:02.165
Let me through!

32:02.167 --> 32:05.135
Paul!

32:13.945 --> 32:16.279
Were you trying to make me
give you mouth-to-mouth?

32:16.281 --> 32:19.416
Was I what? Are you crazy?

32:20.451 --> 32:22.486
Wai... hey, come on!

32:25.656 --> 32:29.459
Hey, I'm sorry. It was a stupid move.

32:29.461 --> 32:31.428
On that we agree. Let me get you dinner.

32:31.430 --> 32:32.929
It'll be so much more satisfying

32:32.931 --> 32:34.464
to hate me on a full stomach.

32:34.466 --> 32:36.867
It'll be tough to top
what I'm feeling right now.

32:36.869 --> 32:39.269
Okay, look, I haven't taken a woman out

32:39.271 --> 32:40.637
in a long time.

32:40.639 --> 32:42.773
I'm out of practice. I got nervous.

32:42.775 --> 32:45.909
Give me a second chance.

32:51.115 --> 32:52.783
Hey.

32:52.785 --> 32:54.618
Hi.

32:54.620 --> 32:56.920
So the cardiologist confirmed you have

32:56.922 --> 32:58.789
long Q.T. syndrome.

32:58.791 --> 33:01.658
And when people with L.Q.T.
are startled...

33:01.660 --> 33:03.860
like from fire engine Freddy's siren

33:03.862 --> 33:05.929
or Simon pushing you into the pool...

33:05.931 --> 33:08.231
your heart can jump into an arrhythmia.

33:08.233 --> 33:10.067
So that's what made me faint?

33:10.069 --> 33:12.102
Yes. And sent you into seizure.

33:12.104 --> 33:14.404
Some people with L.Q.T.
will have clean E.K.G.s

33:14.406 --> 33:16.006
and feel no effects

33:16.008 --> 33:17.841
except when the syndrome's exacerbated

33:17.843 --> 33:19.943
by one of a list of medications.

33:19.945 --> 33:21.678
But I'm not taking anything.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.947
So what's making it worse?

33:23.949 --> 33:26.817
Right. And what made
the L.Q.T. suddenly visible?

33:26.819 --> 33:28.151
I don't know yet.

33:28.153 --> 33:30.420
Perfect. I finally figure out

33:30.422 --> 33:31.822
what I wanna do with the rest of my life,

33:31.824 --> 33:34.091
and maybe I can't even do it anymore.

33:34.093 --> 33:35.992
You didn't always wanna work with kids?

33:35.994 --> 33:37.360
I didn't know what I wanted.

33:37.362 --> 33:38.929
I wasn't good at anything.

33:38.931 --> 33:40.397
That's hard to believe.

33:40.399 --> 33:42.165
And you're so amazing with Simon.

33:43.502 --> 33:45.335
Because I <i>was</i> Simon.

33:45.337 --> 33:48.004
When I was little, I was the scared kid,

33:48.006 --> 33:51.108
the outsider...
even when I wasn't so little.

33:51.110 --> 33:53.510
It's funny. I take care of a boy
who's scared all the time,

33:53.512 --> 33:55.846
and I'm the one that gets sick
from being startled.

33:55.848 --> 33:57.347
Hmm.

33:57.349 --> 33:59.516
Maybe "funny" is the wrong word.

33:59.518 --> 34:00.817
Maybe.

34:00.819 --> 34:03.153
- Hi!
- Chocolate chip! Your favorite!

34:03.155 --> 34:05.021
- Cookies!
- I made them.

34:05.023 --> 34:06.189
And Marilyn helped.

34:06.191 --> 34:09.860
Wow. They look amazing!

34:09.862 --> 34:11.293
Yeah, they do. I want one.

34:11.295 --> 34:12.496
So where's Marilyn?

34:12.498 --> 34:14.664
Just outside talking to a nurse.

34:14.666 --> 34:17.601
We're going to take you home soon.

34:17.603 --> 34:21.838
First you have to finish your lunch.

34:22.907 --> 34:26.143
- You first.
- Me first?

34:26.145 --> 34:28.445
Me first.

34:29.580 --> 34:32.649
Uh, Toby, you always go first

34:32.650 --> 34:34.618
when Simon's trying something new.

34:34.620 --> 34:36.585
That's her secret trick.

34:36.588 --> 34:38.255
And it's a good one, but, Toby,

34:38.257 --> 34:41.158
did you ever do that trick
with Simon's new nebulizer mask?

34:41.159 --> 34:43.793
Sure, but I never actually inhaled.

34:43.795 --> 34:45.195
The albuterol still
could've been absorbed

34:45.197 --> 34:47.697
in the mucus membranes
of your nose and mouth,

34:47.699 --> 34:48.998
and it's one of the medications

34:49.001 --> 34:50.634
that can provoke your condition.

34:50.636 --> 34:52.802
Is Toby going to be okay?

34:52.804 --> 34:55.639
Like one of the fearlesses,
I'll make sure of it.

34:55.641 --> 34:56.907
With the proper medication,

34:56.909 --> 34:58.642
she will be able to stay with you

34:58.644 --> 35:01.278
and finish getting you ready for school.

35:03.081 --> 35:05.048
So if I hadn't accidentally inhaled

35:05.050 --> 35:06.483
some of Simon's albuterol,

35:06.485 --> 35:08.618
I never would've found out
about my heart?

35:08.620 --> 35:09.920
That's right.

35:11.789 --> 35:13.123
You saved me again.

35:13.125 --> 35:15.859
That's my job. I'm a superhero.

35:15.861 --> 35:18.328
Yes, you are.

35:18.330 --> 35:19.930
Do you want a cookie?

35:19.932 --> 35:23.333
Oh, no. They're for you.

35:29.941 --> 35:32.842
- And they just cut you off?
- Cold Turkey.

35:32.844 --> 35:34.344
Wow.

35:34.346 --> 35:35.679
But you didn't love the guy.

35:35.681 --> 35:37.214
My father is many things.

35:37.216 --> 35:39.216
A romantic is not one of them.

35:39.218 --> 35:41.084
It took guts what you did.

35:41.086 --> 35:42.519
Well, it was the only thing to do.

35:42.521 --> 35:44.521
Doesn't make it any easier.

35:44.523 --> 35:45.722
How about you?

35:45.724 --> 35:47.490
Any war stories?

35:47.492 --> 35:49.593
Me?

35:49.595 --> 35:52.295
No, I, uh... I'm pretty boring.

35:52.297 --> 35:53.964
Never engaged

35:53.966 --> 35:55.932
or dis-engaged.

35:55.934 --> 35:58.134
Happy childhood.

35:58.136 --> 35:59.636
Parents loved me.

35:59.638 --> 36:01.371
Harvard med on a scholarship,

36:01.373 --> 36:04.207
and I'm working summers out here.

36:04.209 --> 36:07.077
But I hate talking about me.

36:08.846 --> 36:11.248
I'm sorry we never made it
to Nick & Toni's.

36:11.250 --> 36:13.149
Who knew you couldn't
show up 90 minutes late

36:13.151 --> 36:14.851
for a reservation?

36:14.853 --> 36:17.687
Next date, no helmets.

36:21.959 --> 36:25.195
There's not gonna be a next date.

36:26.698 --> 36:28.732
It was the mouth-to-mouth thing, wasn't it?

36:28.734 --> 36:31.534
Tsk, that was dumb. I'm sorry.

36:31.536 --> 36:34.504
My dating skills never
progressed past high school.

36:34.506 --> 36:36.339
You were doing that in high school?

36:36.341 --> 36:38.141
I haven't had a lot of girlfriends.

36:38.143 --> 36:39.676
I just haven't had the time.

36:39.678 --> 36:42.045
And I may be a social moron,

36:42.047 --> 36:44.347
but you have dated the same guy
since you were, like, five.

36:44.349 --> 36:46.016
- 11.
- My point is,

36:46.018 --> 36:49.152
we both need practice in the dating arena.

36:49.154 --> 36:50.887
- Practice?
- Yes.

36:50.889 --> 36:53.123
Platonic practice.

36:53.125 --> 36:56.126
Clearly I need all the help I can get.

36:56.128 --> 36:57.594
So how about this?

36:57.596 --> 36:59.462
We go out again,
but we don't call it a date,

36:59.464 --> 37:01.398
because it's not a date.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.799
What is it then?

37:02.801 --> 37:05.702
Two people getting to know each other.

37:05.704 --> 37:07.037
As friends.

37:07.039 --> 37:09.539
But we are not friends.

37:09.541 --> 37:12.942
Not yet. But you know
how I like surprises.

37:16.547 --> 37:19.215
You know what? This is a nice boat.

37:19.217 --> 37:22.185
Yeah. I wonder whose it is.

37:29.493 --> 37:31.795
Hey, mom. How ya doing?

37:31.797 --> 37:35.065
Not ready to go down to the party.

37:35.067 --> 37:36.333
Okay.

37:36.335 --> 37:38.668
Well, everything looks great down there.

37:38.670 --> 37:41.738
People are having fun.
It's all taken care of, so...

37:41.740 --> 37:44.774
Thank you. Both.

37:44.776 --> 37:47.644
Not me. It's all her.
She's the perfect host.

37:47.646 --> 37:49.579
And the perfect daughter.

37:49.581 --> 37:50.914
And the perfect girlfriend.

37:50.916 --> 37:54.818
So basically she's just really perfect.

37:54.820 --> 37:57.220
She is all those things.

37:57.222 --> 37:58.788
Mm-hmm.

37:58.790 --> 38:00.357
You two should go down
and have fun at the party.

38:00.359 --> 38:02.459
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

38:02.461 --> 38:05.161
Okay.

38:05.163 --> 38:08.798
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.801
Evan.

38:11.803 --> 38:14.637
When you were telling my mom
how perfect I am...

38:14.639 --> 38:16.306
You know what?
Even if she wasn't in the room,

38:16.308 --> 38:17.941
I would've said the exact same thing,

38:17.943 --> 38:20.410
just not as forcefully.

38:20.412 --> 38:22.078
Hey, that's my point.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.713
You put me on a pedestal,
always telling me

38:23.715 --> 38:27.117
how perfect I am, and it puts
a lot of pressure on me.

38:27.119 --> 38:29.119
But you <i>are</i> perfect.

38:29.121 --> 38:31.421
I need to know that
you're gonna be there for me

38:31.423 --> 38:36.826
if everything falls apart,
which it always does.

38:36.828 --> 38:40.330
Paige, I will love you no matter what.

38:40.332 --> 38:42.866
I'm gonna be there for you.

38:42.868 --> 38:46.035
With you. Right beside you.

38:46.037 --> 38:47.871
Basically you won't
be able to get rid of me.

38:47.873 --> 38:50.106
And I will never, ever, ever,

38:50.108 --> 38:52.709
ever, ever call you perfect again ever.

38:52.711 --> 38:54.177
Okay, let's not get carried away.

38:54.179 --> 38:56.813
Ever again.

39:04.822 --> 39:07.557
Paige, how is your mother feeling?

39:07.559 --> 39:10.660
Um...

39:10.662 --> 39:13.029
You know what? It's just
a touch of the summer flu.

39:13.031 --> 39:15.165
She was really sorry
she had to miss the party,

39:15.167 --> 39:17.500
but the doctor's orders
were very specific.

39:17.502 --> 39:19.002
She has to stay home and rest.

39:19.004 --> 39:20.603
She sends her regards,

39:20.605 --> 39:22.338
and I think she'd probably
rather us stop talking about her

39:22.340 --> 39:23.773
and enjoy the party.

39:23.775 --> 39:26.109
So why don't we all grab
a glass of champagne

39:26.111 --> 39:27.944
and, uh, take our seats,

39:27.946 --> 39:29.679
'cause it looks like
the general's about to speak.

39:29.681 --> 39:31.347
Yeah, there he goes.

39:31.349 --> 39:33.049
So, uh, yeah, she's... she's gonna be fine.

39:33.051 --> 39:34.551
Thanks for asking.

40:01.145 --> 40:02.779
Thank you...

40:34.133 --> 40:35.566
Look, I think...

40:35.568 --> 40:36.968
If you're waiting for an apology...

40:36.970 --> 40:38.770
I'm not.

40:38.772 --> 40:40.938
You were just standing there
not saying anything.

40:40.940 --> 40:43.608
I started to talk,
but you interrupted me.

40:43.610 --> 40:45.109
So you weren't gonna
ask me for an apology?

40:45.111 --> 40:46.377
- No.
- Good.

40:46.379 --> 40:47.945
'Cause I have nothing to apologize for.

40:47.947 --> 40:50.381
Okay.

40:50.383 --> 40:52.417
You were saying?

40:52.419 --> 40:55.620
This whole thing has been complicated,

40:55.622 --> 40:56.888
and I'm sorry.

40:56.890 --> 40:58.923
I am sorry for the part I played in it.

40:58.925 --> 41:01.159
I wanted to tell you. I really did.

41:01.161 --> 41:02.460
Yeah, just not badly enough.

41:02.462 --> 41:03.561
Right?

41:03.563 --> 41:06.064
It's not that simple.

41:06.066 --> 41:10.201
Evan, I hope you can forgive me.

41:13.907 --> 41:17.975
Okay. Um, these are for Paige's mom.

41:17.977 --> 41:21.412
She left Hamptons Heritage without them.

41:21.414 --> 41:23.014
Okay.

41:23.016 --> 41:25.249
The psychiatrist is willing
to see her as an outpatient

41:25.251 --> 41:26.617
- and thinks that she sh...
- What are you doing here, Lawson?

41:26.619 --> 41:28.252
What do you mean, sir?

41:28.254 --> 41:30.088
You and I, we were just having some tea.

41:30.090 --> 41:33.624
- I was just... I was...
- Not you, Evan. Your brother.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.396
Uh, sir,

41:38.398 --> 41:40.431
I'm here because I wanna help your wife.

41:40.433 --> 41:42.266
She doesn't need your help.

41:42.268 --> 41:45.069
And if you're not off
this property in two minutes,

41:45.071 --> 41:46.971
you will be trespassing.

41:50.175 --> 41:53.010
You staying or going?
