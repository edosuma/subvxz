00:37.218 --> 00:39.773
Hey, I'm mixing up the eggnog.

00:39.808 --> 00:42.475
You want this broad lit up
or just slightly glowing?

00:45.129 --> 00:47.355
Well, let’s see, we’re
celebrating peace on earth

00:47.390 --> 00:50.907
...and good will towards all mankind,
so let’s get ‘er plowed!

00:51.770 --> 00:52.829
Hallelujah!

00:54.612 --> 01:01.438
Glo-oh-oh-oh-oh-ria

Tonight I’m boinking Gloria.

Four callgirls, three french maids
two drunk twins...

01:40.709 --> 01:44.601
...and a lap dance in a pear tree.

01:47.396 --> 01:48.968
Merry Christmas, Uncle Charlie.

01:48.969 --> 01:51.412
Oh, right.
The other part of Christmas.

01:51.793 --> 01:52.899
Go ahead, open it.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.095
Hold on.
Let me give you your gift first.

01:56.496 --> 01:57.959
I don't want you to think I forgot you.

02:02.743 --> 02:05.738
- A hundred bucks? Wow!
- I picked it out myself.

02:07.552 --> 02:10.390
- Now open yours.
- Okay.

02:11.742 --> 02:12.960
It's kind of exciting...

02:18.028 --> 02:19.534
Fart in a can?

02:22.373 --> 02:24.158
You don't have one, do you?

02:25.767 --> 02:27.395
Well, I've got you.

02:28.257 --> 02:29.539
This is good for travel.

02:31.236 --> 02:34.197
Jake, I just talked to your mom
she's gonna be here any minute.

02:34.398 --> 02:36.847
Don't look at Uncle Charlie's gift.
You're getting the same thing.

02:38.427 --> 02:41.148
- Oh, boy. I'm excited.
- Don't be.

02:41.374 --> 02:45.735
Oh, speaking of gifts...
Merry Christmas.

02:46.498 --> 02:47.608
I'll leave it up to you.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.804
You can open it tomorrow
morning at your mom's or...

02:52.405 --> 02:55.175
You can rip it open with
your teeth like a rabied jackal.

02:56.631 --> 02:58.641
You got me the new Nintendo?

02:58.676 --> 03:00.064
It's from Uncle Charlie, too.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.663
You owe me 125 dollars.

03:04.041 --> 03:06.075
- But I just...
- Wow, this is so cool!

03:06.076 --> 03:08.613
Thanks Dad! Thanks Uncle Charlie!

03:08.614 --> 03:10.392
Yeah yeah. Merry Christmas.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.622
- I'm gonna go hook it up.
- No no no.

03:12.623 --> 03:13.623
No, you're leaving.

03:13.624 --> 03:15.280
Your Uncle Charlie's hookin' up.

03:18.178 --> 03:20.549
- You're leaving too, right?
- Yes, relax.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.766
I plan on spending Christmas Eve
at a movie theatre all by myself...

03:23.767 --> 03:24.767
...just so you can have sex tonight.

03:26.202 --> 03:27.689
You can have sex too.

03:27.724 --> 03:29.322
Just pick the right movie theatre.

03:31.758 --> 03:33.129
Jake! Time to go!

03:33.932 --> 03:36.543
Take some paper towels and
don't wear your suede shoes.

03:41.178 --> 03:44.516
- Ho ho ho.
- That's another option.

03:47.647 --> 03:50.336
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas! Come on in.

03:51.206 --> 03:52.232
Hey, Merry Christmas, Charlie.

03:52.652 --> 03:54.443
Yeah, swell. I go get the kid.

03:55.549 --> 03:58.750
- Ooh, eggnog.
- Honey, we've got a long drive ahead of us.

03:58.751 --> 04:00.943
We're spending the holiday
in San Diego with my parents.

04:00.944 --> 04:02.538
That's why I need eggnog.

04:03.039 --> 04:05.393
Hey, I spent thanksgiving with your parents.

04:05.518 --> 04:07.472
Oh, oh really? Your Mom's out of rehab?

04:08.701 --> 04:10.552
Yes, my Mom's out of rehab.

04:10.587 --> 04:12.312
Actually, she kind of jumped the fence.

04:14.519 --> 04:16.959
Well, woman's gonna be your mother-in-law
you might as well get used to it.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.060
Remember the time she rode out
of Betty Ford on a lawnmower?

04:23.154 --> 04:26.347
On a plus side she bakes Toll House
cookies with walnuts and demerol.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.279
Stuff never goes back in
the box the way it came out.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.011
That's a life lesson, Jake.

04:35.161 --> 04:37.675
Come on, your Mom's here.
Vamos.

04:39.514 --> 04:43.077
Ok, table set on the deck
and dinner's in the owen.

04:43.078 --> 04:44.172
Right.

04:44.173 --> 04:46.195
You might wanna keep the
candles away from the eggnog.

04:46.196 --> 04:47.216
Got it.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.478
Allright then.
I'm leaving now.

04:50.479 --> 04:52.458
Well, then goodbye and thanks.

04:52.558 --> 04:54.475
Yeah, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

04:54.476 --> 04:56.167
- All the best.
- Same to you.

05:00.220 --> 05:02.174
Gimme my bonus you blockhead.

05:04.573 --> 05:05.827
Oh, right.

05:07.751 --> 05:10.287
Thank you for all your hard work.

05:15.776 --> 05:18.722
I couldn't get along without you.

05:22.966 --> 05:24.019
You're one in a million.

05:28.099 --> 05:29.179
Really?

05:29.824 --> 05:31.001
What would Jesus do?

05:37.153 --> 05:39.229
- Herb?
- Oh, no thanks. I'm driving.

05:39.230 --> 05:40.337
I'll have some.

05:40.638 --> 05:42.655
No, you won't.
It's for grownups.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.022
I'll have another.

05:44.023 --> 05:45.362
Sweetie, my parents are waiting.

05:45.898 --> 05:47.019
I know, dear.

05:49.068 --> 05:51.053
Apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, does it?

05:52.877 --> 05:57.536
Okay. Merry Christmas to all.
And to all: a goodbye.

05:58.788 --> 06:03.103
Hang on. I got a long bus ride and
I dont want to sober up halfway home.

06:04.004 --> 06:05.103
Hello?

06:05.504 --> 06:07.601
Kandy?
What are you doing here?

06:08.066 --> 06:11.597
I didn't wana be alone on Christmas Eve
and I didn't know where else to go.

06:12.181 --> 06:13.238
Where's your new boyfriend?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.730
He decided to spend
Christmas with his family.

06:15.765 --> 06:17.111
Why didn't he bring you along?

06:17.146 --> 06:20.114
He thought I would make
his wife uncomfortable.

06:22.321 --> 06:24.034
Oh, sweetie come on in.

06:24.035 --> 06:26.726
Whoa whoa whoa
I've got company coming, remember?

06:26.727 --> 06:28.125
I can't just throw her out, Charlie.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.226
How do you know if you don't try?

06:30.593 --> 06:32.115
Lighten up, it's Christmas.

06:32.669 --> 06:35.637
Okay, two minutes, and then
I bring out the fart in the can.

06:39.179 --> 06:40.429
You remember Judith.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.639
- Hi Judith.
- Hello.

06:43.375 --> 06:44.561
And this is her fiancé, Herb.

06:44.562 --> 06:45.862
- Hi Herb.
- Hi.

06:45.863 --> 06:46.863
Hey, let me take your coat.

06:51.774 --> 06:53.725
Oh my golly.

06:55.944 --> 06:57.394
Well, I guess we should get going.

06:57.495 --> 06:58.697
What's the hurry?

07:00.075 --> 07:01.373
Your parents are waiting, remember?

07:01.449 --> 07:02.925
What do you care,
they don't like you anyway.

07:05.398 --> 07:06.423
Eggnog?

07:06.624 --> 07:07.957
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:08.791 --> 07:09.970
I'm a doctor.

07:10.571 --> 07:12.217
A real one or like Alan?

07:14.519 --> 07:15.768
I'm a pediatrician.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.724
Wow. So you're into feet?

07:18.552 --> 07:19.640
No. Children.

07:20.145 --> 07:21.507
Isn't that illegal?

07:24.050 --> 07:26.395
Berta. Don't you have a bus to catch?

07:26.396 --> 07:28.231
And miss the show, are you nuts?

07:30.010 --> 07:31.717
Feliz navidad everyone.

07:33.008 --> 07:34.404
I didn't see that one coming.

07:36.312 --> 07:37.610
Mom, what are you doing here?

07:37.611 --> 07:40.351
Well I was on my way to a party.
Thought I drop off your gift...

07:40.352 --> 07:43.017
...so I don't have to schlepp back here
tomorrow and mess up my day.

07:44.525 --> 07:46.663
- Charlie?
- Rose!

07:47.338 --> 07:49.603
How could you have a Christmas
party and not invite me.

07:50.372 --> 07:53.063
- This isn't a Christmas party.
- What do you call it?

07:53.564 --> 07:57.415
The beggining of a new story that ends with
the phrase: "then turned the gun on himself"

07:59.986 --> 08:02.600
Allright, allright.
Everybody listen up, listen to me.

08:03.201 --> 08:06.695
There is no party.
You all have to leave now...

08:06.795 --> 08:08.381
because a beautiful woman is coming over...

08:08.382 --> 08:11.419
and I intend to get her drunk
and have sex with her.

08:11.510 --> 08:12.815
That's a good plan.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.664
Except I'm already drunk.

08:19.838 --> 08:22.281
Boy, I can't wait 'till the second act.

08:26.709 --> 08:30.300
Here we go.
More fuel for the fire.

08:31.376 --> 08:32.618
You said you were going home.

08:32.653 --> 08:34.875
Well, that was before I knew
you're having a party.

08:35.871 --> 08:37.448
This isn't a party.

08:37.908 --> 08:42.073
It's just a bunch of people I don't like
standing around drinking my booze.

08:42.073 --> 08:43.481
Oh, crap. It is a party.

08:44.749 --> 08:46.010
Gimme that.

08:49.611 --> 08:51.642
I'd love to know what
those two are talking about.

08:51.789 --> 08:53.646
I could tell you. I read lips.

08:54.612 --> 08:55.785
- Really?
- Yep.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.971
Now you're date is saying...

09:00.006 --> 09:03.921
A wily ostrich sank my boat.

09:06.722 --> 09:10.788
I have a little congestion in my
upper chest. Can you take a look at it?

09:10.989 --> 09:14.096
- Oh well I could...
- Kandi, he's a pediatrician.

09:14.131 --> 09:15.961
- He only treats children.
- Now hold on.

09:16.859 --> 09:18.597
There's no actual age limit.

09:19.483 --> 09:22.606
I took an oath to ease
suffering wherever I find it.

09:23.984 --> 09:25.347
Alan, a word.

09:26.278 --> 09:28.359
Oh, good. A word.

09:30.394 --> 09:34.652
I don't have my stethoscope, so why don't
you just breathe in and out for me.

09:38.409 --> 09:39.963
Make this stop.

09:40.284 --> 09:42.752
I'm sorry.
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:43.153 --> 09:47.034
Don't screw with me. Tell your ex-wife
to stop flirting with my fiancé.

09:47.571 --> 09:52.366
Gee, that's funny. the way I see it,
your peanut butter is all over my chocolate.

09:53.695 --> 09:55.761
Damn it, Alan,
I can make your life a living hell.

09:56.372 --> 09:57.641
How would I know the difference?

09:58.977 --> 10:00.270
Cough again.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.152
Once more.

10:04.553 --> 10:06.584
Let's have a little pow-wow.

10:06.585 --> 10:07.585
She might have a touch of the croup.

10:09.579 --> 10:11.873
- Listen, Herb.
- So you were married to her?

10:11.908 --> 10:13.390
Yes, we were married.

10:13.425 --> 10:15.520
Herb, Judith is getting
really upset with you.

10:15.521 --> 10:16.595
So you got to see her naked?

10:18.674 --> 10:19.672
Stay with me Herb.

10:19.973 --> 10:23.360
- Your fiancée is very angry.
- Really? How come?

10:23.498 --> 10:27.099
I don't know. Maybe it's because you were
trying to use Kandi's nipple as a Q-Tip.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.431
It's Ok.
I'm a doctor.

10:30.986 --> 10:34.028
Just do yourself a favor,
go pay some attention to Judith.

10:34.029 --> 10:35.029
Oh, allright.

10:39.082 --> 10:40.148
Some party, huh?

10:40.383 --> 10:42.859
Yeah, I'm glad I didn't
waste this buzz on the bus.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.402
Here comes your mom. Act like you
didn't know what they were saying.

10:48.306 --> 10:51.357
- Charlie. I must talk to you.
- I know. Why is that?

10:52.327 --> 10:54.977
How serious is your
relationship with Gloria?

10:54.978 --> 10:58.077
Not that it's any of your business,
but this is our second date.

10:58.112 --> 10:59.377
What happened on the first date?

10:59.412 --> 11:02.357
He went out to dinner, he took her
home and made out a little bit in the car.

11:02.758 --> 11:05.550
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you want to tell it?

11:06.404 --> 11:09.294
- So you haven't slept together.
- Not yet.

11:09.295 --> 11:12.689
- Oops, here I go again.
- That's good.

11:12.724 --> 11:16.339
Darling, you need to end
this relationship now.

11:16.340 --> 11:17.490
Why?

11:19.737 --> 11:22.075
- Do you trust me?
- No.

11:23.319 --> 11:26.904
Ok, but you know I have your
best interest at heart, don't you?

11:26.905 --> 11:28.050
No.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.889
Allright, then let me put it this way.

11:31.429 --> 11:34.416
I forbid you to see this woman anymore.

11:34.717 --> 11:36.075
You forbid?

11:36.529 --> 11:39.068
What gives you to forbid?
I'm 39 years old.

11:39.069 --> 11:42.948
I'm your mother, you're 40, and you
must not see this woman anymore.

11:43.518 --> 11:45.718
Mom, you know that just
makes me want her more.

11:45.719 --> 11:47.249
Charlie, I mean it.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.495
I'm getting hotter.

11:49.430 --> 11:55.429
Look. I know certain things about
Gloria's past wich are, well... unsavory.

11:55.530 --> 11:57.783
Ok, I'm going supernova.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.598
Would you listen to me?

12:00.737 --> 12:05.267
If you continue to see this woman,
it will hurt me deeply.

12:06.068 --> 12:07.603
I may have to marry this girl.

12:07.604 --> 12:10.945
Okay, okay. You give me no choice.

12:11.546 --> 12:12.888
Who are you calling?

12:12.889 --> 12:15.188
It's probably about the
ostrich and the boat.

12:17.545 --> 12:20.624
Charlie, I'm getting pretty drunk,
so if you like a girl who moves

12:20.659 --> 12:22.074
you better do me soon.

12:23.424 --> 12:24.475
Follow me.

12:25.754 --> 12:31.437
Aw, ain't that sweet? Everytime
a guy has sex and angel gets a stiffie.

12:33.890 --> 12:35.285
Will you look at them?

12:36.081 --> 12:38.940
Oh, I completely forgot
about the subplot.

12:40.512 --> 12:43.836
What do you want me to do, Judith?
He's your man. You want him, fight for him.

12:43.837 --> 12:45.228
How could I compete with that?

12:45.229 --> 12:47.314
There's no competition.
Herb loves you.

12:47.315 --> 12:50.966
You have a mature, sophisticated
relationship based on mutual respect.

12:50.967 --> 12:52.466
All Kandi has is...

12:54.835 --> 12:56.035
There will be other men...

12:56.796 --> 12:59.278
Just get her as soon as you can!

13:01.479 --> 13:04.539
Where's Charlie?
Oh, dammit!

13:05.198 --> 13:09.971
Oh, I get it. It's like Tony n' Tina's
Wedding. You gotta followin' around.

13:11.552 --> 13:14.201
Hey Mammy-o, Daddy-o!
- Hi buddy.

13:14.782 --> 13:18.815
Mammy-o, Daddy-o, Daddy-o
Mammy-o, Mammy-o, Daddy-o.

13:21.543 --> 13:22.691
STOP!

13:24.586 --> 13:25.595
Mom!

13:25.696 --> 13:27.667
Get out of that bed this instant!

13:28.168 --> 13:29.951
I don't think that's a good idea.

13:30.952 --> 13:32.517
Charlie, I'm warning you.

13:32.518 --> 13:35.826
You can't tell him what to do,
he's 34 years old.

13:35.827 --> 13:38.041
- What?
- She's drunk.

13:40.433 --> 13:41.828
Mom, what are you doing here?

13:41.875 --> 13:44.594
I'm trying to keep you
from doing a horrible mistake.

13:44.895 --> 13:47.390
What do you care?
I make this mistake on a regular basis.

13:47.391 --> 13:48.938
Some might call it a lifestyle.

13:49.439 --> 13:50.624
- Charlie, I...
- I don't want to hear it.

13:51.325 --> 13:54.876
I came up here to do a job.
Actually, two jobs and a chore.

13:55.539 --> 13:58.710
Now, you can stay and watch,
wich I don't recommend,

13:58.745 --> 14:03.426
or you can leave. Either way Gloria
and I are going to have sex.

14:06.372 --> 14:07.380
Go ahead.

14:10.322 --> 14:11.550
Okay, I'm bluffing.

14:14.551 --> 14:16.181
He sure is.

14:22.071 --> 14:23.937
Jingle bells, jingle bells

14:24.275 --> 14:25.840
Jingle all the way

14:26.230 --> 14:30.650
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

14:30.691 --> 14:32.695
Jingle bells, jingle bells...

14:32.896 --> 14:35.337
- Um, have you seen Jake?
- Nope.

14:35.338 --> 14:36.338
Huh.

14:44.839 --> 14:46.538
- Jake?
- Whoa, whoa!

14:47.139 --> 14:49.447
Judith, what the
hell are you doing?

14:49.448 --> 14:52.178
You told me to fight for my man,
I'm fighting for my man.

14:53.363 --> 14:55.332
Alan, would you please close the door?

14:57.768 --> 14:58.833
Allright.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.665
Twelve years of marriage, she never
fought for me from that angle.

15:06.442 --> 15:10.619
<i>Silent night</i>

15:10.955 --> 15:14.596
<i>Holy night</i>

15:15.143 --> 15:16.613
- Kandi?
- Yeah?

15:16.814 --> 15:17.843
Take a break.
- Oki doc.

15:26.924 --> 15:28.044
Hello.

15:28.092 --> 15:31.055
Oh my goodness. Are you Alan?

15:31.056 --> 15:33.938
- Um, yes.
- I haven't seen you in 35 years.

15:34.373 --> 15:37.734
No kidding.
I'm sorry I don't remember you.

15:37.735 --> 15:39.335
Oh, well I'm not surprised.

15:39.336 --> 15:42.001
At the time you were busy
learning to use the big boy potty.

15:42.502 --> 15:43.711
Ah, well...

15:44.671 --> 15:45.695
I did it!

15:47.784 --> 15:49.128
Good job.

15:49.981 --> 15:53.148
Um, listen Alan.
I'm looking for my daughter.

15:53.549 --> 15:55.017
Drunk blonde?

15:55.318 --> 15:57.547
Well she isn't always... blonde.

16:00.147 --> 16:02.095
- Upstairs.
- Ah, thank you.

16:02.858 --> 16:07.053
You know, you turned out
to be a very attractive man.

16:07.054 --> 16:08.043
Oh, thank you.

16:08.044 --> 16:09.574
Could have gone either way.

16:10.075 --> 16:12.197
Lucky you grew into those ears.

16:16.914 --> 16:20.209
<i>Frosty the Snowman</i>

16:20.210 --> 16:23.589
<i>Was a very jolly soul</i>

16:23.624 --> 16:27.322
<i>With a corncob pipe and a button nose</i>

16:27.364 --> 16:31.064
<i>And two eyes made out of coal.</i>

16:31.164 --> 16:34.274
Dammit Charlie, you don't know
what you're getting into here.

16:34.275 --> 16:36.333
Oh, I think I have a pretty good idea.

16:36.834 --> 16:39.082
I mean what could you
possibly tell me about Gloria

16:39.117 --> 16:40.482
that would get me
to kick her out of bed?

16:40.683 --> 16:44.065
She's married, clinically insane,
she's a man? You're not a man, are you?

16:44.100 --> 16:45.212
- No.
- Then we're good.

16:46.513 --> 16:48.716
- Gloria, get out of that bed!
- Mom!

16:48.717 --> 16:49.717
Mom?

16:50.985 --> 16:53.260
- Well, did tell them?
- I tried, but I couldn't.

16:53.261 --> 16:54.979
- Why not?
- What do you mean why not?

16:55.012 --> 16:56.062
What do you think?

16:56.063 --> 16:58.143
Oh, so as usual I have
to do your dirty work.

16:58.144 --> 17:00.706
You can't sleep with him
because he might be your brother.

17:03.345 --> 17:04.473
There. Was that so hard?

17:05.896 --> 17:08.346
It's certainly not hard for
someone who has no shame.

17:08.646 --> 17:10.878
Says the woman who killed my husband.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.930
I did not kill Sherman,
I made Sherman happy.

17:13.964 --> 17:15.527
Excuse me, excuse me.
Hold on, hold on.

17:16.383 --> 17:19.005
Can we go back to the part,
where I may be her brother...

17:19.880 --> 17:22.811
Oh, dear Lord, has the blood
not returned to your brain, yet?

17:23.113 --> 17:26.239
It was the 70's, we were
young attractive couples.

17:26.273 --> 17:29.550
And there was a gas shortage,
so we had to entertain at home.

17:30.151 --> 17:31.697
Wait, wait wait.

17:32.139 --> 17:35.287
Are you saying you and her husband...

17:35.588 --> 17:37.910
Yes, and she and your father...

17:38.000 --> 17:39.073
it's a blame-o pack.

17:41.885 --> 17:44.342
It started with a weekly
fondue party, but...

17:44.543 --> 17:46.751
one night the dipping didn't stop at cheese.

17:49.384 --> 17:51.369
Fortunately some of us couldn't handle it.

17:51.877 --> 17:55.526
You did unspeakable things with Sherman
and then he wanted to them with me.

17:56.316 --> 17:59.190
Oh nonsense, I just raised the bar a bit.

17:59.225 --> 18:01.451
Raised the bar? Do you have any idea...

18:01.573 --> 18:03.129
how many third world
countries that man visited...

18:03.160 --> 18:05.368
trying to find someone else
who would do those things?

18:05.669 --> 18:09.010
He didn't have to go abroad.
He was just looking for a bargain.

18:09.011 --> 18:13.244
If it weren't for you he would never
have contracted Amoebic dysentery and die.

18:13.279 --> 18:15.058
I... I hate to interrupt...

18:15.741 --> 18:18.869
but I'm still trying to process
the "I'm her brother" thing.

18:20.614 --> 18:23.208
Not the shiniest penny
in the road, is he?

18:23.509 --> 18:26.292
Now allright.
I guess I'm gonna spell it out for you.

18:26.793 --> 18:28.652
Based on the amount
of time that have lapsed...

18:28.687 --> 18:31.627
between the last fondue
party and Gloria's birth...

18:32.473 --> 18:36.321
Not to mention the fact that Sherman
lost interest in traditional sex with me.

18:36.522 --> 18:38.207
Thank you very much.

18:38.875 --> 18:43.783
There is a very real possibility
that your father may be her father.

18:44.338 --> 18:45.384
- Wow.
- God!

18:45.585 --> 18:49.652
So you can see why an incest of this nature
is completely unacceptable.

18:49.853 --> 18:52.479
It's not like we couldn't
have forseen this...

18:52.617 --> 18:55.249
given that your son has spent
the bulk of his adult life...

18:55.284 --> 18:57.865
humping his way through the
greater Los Angeles area.

19:00.007 --> 19:02.994
Oh, unlike this boozeled tart
is an innocent victim.

19:03.295 --> 19:05.317
Hey, I'm drunk not deaf.

19:06.216 --> 19:08.324
Just get of bed and get dressed.

19:10.476 --> 19:12.737
Well, that was humiliating.

19:12.738 --> 19:15.682
Just be glad we didn't have to tell them
about our little experiment.

19:15.683 --> 19:18.102
- Don't remind me.
- Oh, you loved it.

19:18.903 --> 19:21.630
Oh, a third act twist.

19:23.501 --> 19:25.247
- Wow.
- Yeah.

19:26.007 --> 19:31.022
- I'm so horny right now I can't believe it.
- Who whoa whoa.

19:32.209 --> 19:34.994
Did you miss what just went down here, sis?

19:35.495 --> 19:40.383
Oh, come on it's not like we're gonna get
married and have a bunch of web-footed kids.

19:41.795 --> 19:44.741
You have absolutely no boundaries, do yo?

19:45.380 --> 19:47.986
Well, I don't like fat guys...

19:50.645 --> 19:51.687
Interesting.

19:53.043 --> 19:55.962
Turns out, I draw the line at incest.

19:57.389 --> 19:59.228
So you'd do a fat guy?

20:01.688 --> 20:05.304
Did you hear that?
Charlie found his boundary.

20:05.305 --> 20:08.068
It's a miracle.
Christmas miracle.

20:17.695 --> 20:20.814
Judith, can I just say that this
was the best Christmas ever?

20:21.988 --> 20:23.454
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.

20:24.744 --> 20:28.172
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house...

20:28.173 --> 20:29.495
Not a creature was stirring...

20:35.158 --> 20:38.599
Okay, just so we're clear, you're
only doing this to piss off my Mom?

20:39.718 --> 20:40.772
You have a problem with that?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.622
No, that makes it better.
