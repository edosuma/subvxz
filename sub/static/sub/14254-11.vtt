WEBVTT

00:10.443 --> 00:12.172
Hmm...

00:12.245 --> 00:15.510
Hmm... There.

00:15.582 --> 00:17.516
Excellent.

00:17.584 --> 00:19.950
You recognized
the complementary base pair.

00:20.053 --> 00:23.784
Actually, l just found
two pieces that fit together.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.381
You're missing
the point.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.426
l thought the point
was to finish the puzzle.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.325
And learn something
about genetics.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.523
lf you really want to help,

00:31.598 --> 00:35.466
find me a green piece
that looks like Tuvok's ear.

00:35.568 --> 00:37.365
Commander.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.132
At ease.
l'm just passing through.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.798
l apologize

00:41.908 --> 00:44.342
for the condition
of the cargo bay, sir.

00:44.411 --> 00:45.935
l've been
tutoring Naomi.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.673
Looks like you found
a creative approach.

00:47.747 --> 00:48.839
Thank you, but l'd

00:48.915 --> 00:50.610
appreciate it
if you didn't tell Seven.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.218
l'm supposed
to be writing a paper

00:53.286 --> 00:55.516
on transwarp instability.

00:55.588 --> 00:57.783
Don't worry,
your secret's safe...

00:57.857 --> 00:59.552
as long as you keep mine.

00:59.626 --> 01:00.854
Sir?

01:00.927 --> 01:02.189
Antarian cider.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.230
Not the replicated stuff.

01:04.297 --> 01:06.322
There are only
a couple of bottles left,

01:06.399 --> 01:08.833
and l don't want Mr. Neelix
getting his hands on them.

01:08.935 --> 01:10.266
Well, then you should store them

01:10.370 --> 01:12.099
with the salvaged
Borg components.

01:12.205 --> 01:15.470
Neelix never inventories
those containers.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.339
He says they give him
the creeps.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.537
Officer-level thinking, lcheb.

01:19.612 --> 01:20.704
Would you mind?

01:20.780 --> 01:22.270
Of course not.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.595 --> 01:36.926
Come in.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.358
You're late.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.457
Unfortunately, so's dinner.

01:41.568 --> 01:44.002
Let me guess--
you burned the roast again.

01:44.137 --> 01:46.196
Once, a long time ago,

01:46.306 --> 01:48.672
l called this replicator
a glorified toaster.

01:48.741 --> 01:50.003
lt never forgave me.

01:50.076 --> 01:55.013
l didn't realize
replicators held grudges.

01:55.081 --> 01:56.742
What's so funny?

01:56.816 --> 01:58.477
l just left lcheb and Naomi

01:58.551 --> 02:01.315
assembling a jigsaw
puzzle in the cargo bay.

02:02.355 --> 02:04.289
Find me the thermal
regulator, please.

02:04.357 --> 02:05.654
How is lcheb?

02:05.725 --> 02:09.024
ln a few years, he may
be running the ship.

02:09.095 --> 02:10.562
l don't know about you,

02:10.630 --> 02:12.325
but l'm not ready
to retire just yet.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.527
Janeway to the Bridge. Report.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.104
That was some kind
of gravimetric surge.

02:19.205 --> 02:21.264
lt's overloading
our inertial dampeners.

02:21.374 --> 02:22.341
Source?

02:22.442 --> 02:23.568
That's a good question.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.203
Seven's trying to localize it.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.616
Engineering says the warp core
is destabilizing.

02:30.683 --> 02:31.809
l'd better get down there.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.186
A spatial rift is opening
directly in front of us.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.286
lt's emitting high levels
of neutrinos and chronitons.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.591
On screen.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.364
What is it?

02:50.470 --> 02:52.938
l don't know.

02:54.807 --> 02:56.434
We're losing containment.
Everyone out!

03:16.796 --> 03:18.730
Torres to the Transporter Room.

03:18.798 --> 03:22.029
Beam Commander Chakotay
directly to Sick Bay, now!

05:12.578 --> 05:14.409
Welcome back.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.218
Lie still.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.418
What happened?

05:22.488 --> 05:24.513
You were transported here.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.888
Your body was
in a state of temporal flux.

05:27.026 --> 05:28.857
Temporal flux?

05:28.928 --> 05:30.691
You had the liver
of an 80-year-old man

05:30.763 --> 05:32.390
and the kidneys
of a 12-year-old boy.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.766
Fortunately,
l was able to create

05:35.868 --> 05:37.165
a chroniton-infused serum

05:37.270 --> 05:39.431
that you brought you back
into temporal alignment.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.905
Anywhere else,

05:41.974 --> 05:44.568
that antidote would have
earned me a prestigious award.

05:44.644 --> 05:47.112
Of course, on Voyager,
it's just another day

05:47.180 --> 05:50.377
in the life of an
under-appreciated EMH.

05:50.450 --> 05:51.849
What about the
rest of the crew?

05:51.918 --> 05:52.907
No other casualties?

05:52.985 --> 05:53.952
Not that l'm aware of.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.315
l've tried
calling the Bridge,

05:55.388 --> 05:56.685
but no one answers.

05:56.756 --> 05:57.950
Were we attacked?

05:58.091 --> 05:59.581
l don't think so.

05:59.659 --> 06:03.425
We ran into some
sort of anomaly.

06:04.664 --> 06:07.963
Naturally, no one
thought to inform me.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.364
What do you think
you're doing?

06:09.469 --> 06:10.401
Leaving.

06:10.470 --> 06:11.596
And you're going with me.

06:11.704 --> 06:12.636
l am?

06:12.705 --> 06:14.138
There may be other
injured crewmen.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.139
ln case you've forgotten,

06:15.208 --> 06:17.438
l'm a prisoner of these walls.

06:17.510 --> 06:18.772
Where's your mobile emitter?

06:18.845 --> 06:20.073
My what?

06:23.516 --> 06:24.448
l'll be back.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.449
Wait.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.078
Tell me about this...
mobile emitter.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.251
Bridge.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.942
Harry...

06:56.015 --> 06:56.947
what's going on?

06:57.016 --> 06:57.948
Sir?

06:58.017 --> 06:59.848
l'm afraid l don't know you.

06:59.919 --> 07:00.943
Take him into custody.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.054
How did you get aboard
this ship?

07:06.292 --> 07:07.657
Kathryn...

07:07.727 --> 07:10.821
Oh, l didn't realize
we were on a first-name basis.

07:10.897 --> 07:11.921
We should have known

07:11.998 --> 07:13.590
that the Maquis were involved.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.099
Maquis?

07:15.201 --> 07:16.168
lnvolved in what?

07:17.870 --> 07:19.599
Just when we're about
to chase your ship

07:19.705 --> 07:20.694
into the Badlands,

07:20.807 --> 07:22.502
our systems start malfunctioning

07:22.575 --> 07:24.475
and you step off the turbolift.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.578
Captain, l know this
may be hard to believe,

07:29.649 --> 07:31.116
but l think l've somehow

07:31.184 --> 07:33.982
been thrown seven years
into Voyager's past.

07:34.053 --> 07:35.850
Really?

07:35.922 --> 07:37.480
Let's try another theory.

07:37.557 --> 07:40.754
You learned Voyager had been
assigned to capture you,

07:40.827 --> 07:43.796
and you managed to get
on board to sabotage her.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.694
Check your sensors.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.199
See if they're showing
any strange temporal readings.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.895
Captain, the environmental
controls are fluctuating.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.568
Take him to the brig.

08:06.719 --> 08:09.051
Halt turbolift.

08:09.121 --> 08:10.850
Engineering.

08:16.996 --> 08:17.963
Seska.

08:28.007 --> 08:28.974
Hold him still.

08:37.283 --> 08:40.410
You didn't really think
l'd hurt you, did you?

08:43.489 --> 08:44.820
How'd you get here?

08:44.891 --> 08:46.153
Don't tell me
that little bump

08:46.225 --> 08:48.250
on your head
gave you amnesia.

08:48.327 --> 08:49.294
lt's time you accepted

08:49.362 --> 08:51.262
that l'm in control
of Voyager now.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.293
That was five years ago.

08:55.401 --> 08:57.232
What are you talking about?

08:57.336 --> 09:00.237
Listen, Seska, there's
some kind of temporal anomaly

09:00.306 --> 09:01.273
going on here.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.299
l want to know how many more

09:03.409 --> 09:04.706
of your people
are back on board.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.939
All right, l'll tell you.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.415
l've got a dozen officers
with me.

09:11.484 --> 09:12.815
We've already locked you out

09:12.952 --> 09:13.816
of every key system.

09:13.953 --> 09:14.817
ln less than an hour,

09:14.954 --> 09:16.922
we'll be in control again.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.753
ln less than a minute,
you're going to be dead,

09:19.825 --> 09:22.293
if you don't give me
access to those systems.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.695
l'll need to use that console.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.235
Just don't do anything
you'll regret.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.274
Move.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.249
Stop him!

09:45.318 --> 09:47.411
Warning. Coolant system breach.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.156
Don't make me kill you.

10:04.403 --> 10:05.427
No.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.732
Scan the perimeter.

10:06.839 --> 10:09.034
Report any anomalous readings.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.507
There's something wrong here.

10:25.224 --> 10:28.853
Whoever you are,
l suggest you surrender.

10:28.928 --> 10:29.895
l'm armed!

10:30.963 --> 10:32.362
lt's only me, Doc.

10:32.431 --> 10:33.398
Commander.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.596
Please tell me what's going on.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.101
lf you tell me the stardate.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.694
49624.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.638
No wonder you didn't know
about the mobile emitter.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.335
You don't get it
for another year.

10:44.410 --> 10:45.672
l don't understand.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.679
l'm not sure
l get it myself,

10:47.747 --> 10:49.840
but the ship seems
to have been fractured somehow.

10:49.915 --> 10:51.177
Fractured?

10:51.250 --> 10:54.014
Different areas seem to exist
in different time periods.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.485
How many of these
''time periods'' are there?

10:56.555 --> 10:57.487
l'm not sure.

10:57.556 --> 11:00.457
On the Bridge,
it's before Voyager

11:00.526 --> 11:01.618
even left the Alpha Quadrant.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.059
ln Engineering, it's the time

11:03.129 --> 11:05.154
when the Kazon
took over the ship.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.324
Kazon? We've got
to protect ourselves.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.265
Don't worry.
So far, l'm the only one

11:09.368 --> 11:11.427
who can cross
from one zone into another.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.004
That serum you gave me...

11:13.105 --> 11:16.268
it must have
made me immune.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.140
Normal technology won't
pass through the barriers.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.439
Can you replicate

11:20.513 --> 11:23.243
a chroniton-infused
hypospray casing,

11:23.315 --> 11:25.545
using the same principles
you used to make the serum?

11:25.618 --> 11:26.880
l think so. Why?

11:26.952 --> 11:28.783
l have to take
some of it with me.

11:28.854 --> 11:29.912
What for?

11:29.989 --> 11:32.389
lf l'm going to put the
ship back together again,

11:32.458 --> 11:33.425
l need help.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.333
Captain.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.903
Where are my officers?

11:45.004 --> 11:47.666
The turbolift passed
through a temporal barrier.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.764
They couldn't get through.

11:49.875 --> 11:50.899
lf you're willing
to hear me out,

11:51.010 --> 11:52.477
l can explain...
at least partly.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.207
You mean about your being
from the future?

11:55.281 --> 11:58.512
Your first Starfleet posting
was on the Al-Batani,

11:58.584 --> 12:01.451
where you once knocked out power
to six decks

12:01.520 --> 12:03.420
by misaligning
the positronic relays.

12:03.489 --> 12:06.481
Nice try, but you could
have read that

12:06.559 --> 12:09.153
in the Maquis intelligence file.

12:09.261 --> 12:11.354
How's Molly,

12:11.430 --> 12:13.557
your lrish setter?

12:13.632 --> 12:16.123
You rescued her
from a pound on Taris Seti lV.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.796
She was the runt of the litter,
but you thought she had spunk.

12:18.904 --> 12:22.271
You love music,
but you never learned

12:22.341 --> 12:25.105
to play an instrument--
something you still regret.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.702
How do you know these things?

12:27.780 --> 12:31.978
Because you told me,
about three years from now.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.483
My ready room.

12:46.465 --> 12:50.060
lt's a fascinating story,
but as the Ferengi say,

12:50.169 --> 12:54.003
''A good lie is easier to believe
than the truth.''

12:54.140 --> 12:55.937
So you're saying
no one on your crew

12:56.008 --> 12:58.374
has encountered
one of these temporal barriers?

12:58.444 --> 12:59.741
My helmsman disappeared

12:59.812 --> 13:02.144
when she tried
to walk down that corridor,

13:02.248 --> 13:04.580
but that doesn't prove
she passed through

13:04.617 --> 13:05.879
a temporal barrier.

13:06.018 --> 13:09.078
lf you inject yourself, l can
take you down that corridor

13:09.155 --> 13:11.885
and show you everything
that l've said is true.

13:12.024 --> 13:15.516
Have Mr. Kim run
a full-spectral analysis.

13:15.594 --> 13:17.186
For all l know, this is poison

13:17.263 --> 13:21.359
and Mr. Chakotay is trying
to assassinate me.

13:21.433 --> 13:22.866
She's right.

13:22.968 --> 13:26.426
lt's poison, and l'll use it.

13:33.879 --> 13:36.439
Let her go.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.176
Lower your weapon.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.015
Captain!

13:44.290 --> 13:45.951
Andrews to the Bridge.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.252
l need help here.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.258
Andrews!

13:48.327 --> 13:49.692
He can't hear you.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.957
We've moved into
a different time frame.

13:52.031 --> 13:54.966
Scan the area, but don't
go past that bulkhead.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.762
You want more proof?
lt's right down that corridor.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.497
You just have to trust me.

13:59.605 --> 14:02.096
lt isn't easy
when you're holding me hostage.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.877
Stay or go-- it's your choice.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.776
Now that l'm inoculated,

14:09.849 --> 14:12.818
l can go anywhere
on the ship l want.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.250
That's right.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.187
Then l suppose l don't
need you anymore.

14:17.256 --> 14:20.851
Without me, you'll be
walking into a future

14:20.926 --> 14:22.894
you know nothing about.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.122
Where are we going?

14:24.196 --> 14:25.561
The Astrometrics Lab.

14:25.631 --> 14:28.031
Voyager doesn't have
an Astrometrics Lab.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.591
Harry designed it--
or will design it.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.330
Harry Kim?

14:32.438 --> 14:33.996
l realize,
from your perspective,

14:34.106 --> 14:35.073
he's new to the job,

14:35.174 --> 14:37.938
but he's going to become
one of our best people.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.342
Deck 8.

14:40.412 --> 14:41.811
''Our'' people?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.441
l'm going to be
your First Officer.

14:44.516 --> 14:45.949
Really?

14:46.018 --> 14:50.648
What's the reason we're
going to this, uh, Astrometrics?

14:50.723 --> 14:53.157
lt has temporal sensors
that can help us map the ship

14:53.225 --> 14:56.388
and tell us how many
time frames we're dealing with.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.054
Now you're trying to tell me

14:58.130 --> 15:00.098
Harry Kim invented
temporal sensors?

15:00.165 --> 15:03.828
No. We used Borg technology
for that.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.163
Borg?

15:05.271 --> 15:07.102
lt's a long story.

15:07.172 --> 15:09.834
Maybe you better keep it
to yourself.

15:11.277 --> 15:12.835
The Temporal Prime Directive.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.142
The less l know about
the future, the better.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.520
She's got a pulse.

15:27.026 --> 15:30.120
l'm detecting
an active neurogenic field.

15:30.195 --> 15:32.356
This could be the day
the telepathic pitcher plant

15:32.431 --> 15:34.296
put us all into comas.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.493
Or it might be the time
aliens invaded our dreams.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.593
We've got to get them help.

15:38.704 --> 15:39.636
Don't worry.

15:39.705 --> 15:42.230
We managed to get out
of both situations.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.423
Captain?

15:59.491 --> 16:00.890
l'm sorry--

16:01.026 --> 16:03.153
l don't recognize you,
Lieutenant.

16:03.228 --> 16:07.028
lt's me-- Naomi Wildman.

16:07.099 --> 16:09.431
How did you...?

16:09.535 --> 16:10.763
Are you lcheb?

16:10.869 --> 16:12.359
Yes.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.668
Something tells me
you weren't expecting us.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.174
No, ma'am.

16:17.242 --> 16:19.233
You both died...

16:19.311 --> 16:20.710
17 years ago.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.985
The Captain and l
haven't risen from the grave.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.888
The ship's been fractured
into different time frames.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.515
37, to be exact.

16:34.593 --> 16:36.026
How did you calculate that?

16:36.095 --> 16:39.792
We've had 17 years
to upgrade the sensors.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.732
A chronokinetic surge
interacted with the warp core.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.360
lt shattered the space-time
continuum aboard the ship.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.871
The accident that occurred
in your time frame.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.066
The question is:

16:49.174 --> 16:52.234
Can we repair the damage?

16:52.311 --> 16:54.370
lf we could get
to a section of the ship

16:54.446 --> 16:56.380
that still exists
in that time period,

16:56.448 --> 16:58.279
maybe we could
counteract the surge,

16:58.350 --> 16:59.749
stop it from happening.

16:59.818 --> 17:02.787
That section was
the focal point of the surge.

17:02.888 --> 17:06.085
lt seems to have been...
obliterated.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.460
lt's too bad
Seven's not here.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.462
Seven?

17:11.530 --> 17:12.690
Someone who knows more

17:12.765 --> 17:14.824
about temporal mechanics
than any of us.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.163
Unfortunately, she hasn't
been found, either.

17:18.270 --> 17:20.829
Maybe we can find her
in another time frame.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.669
l have an Ensign
Samantha Wildman on my crew.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.006
My mother.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.876
Naomi was the first
child born on Voyager.

17:28.981 --> 17:32.712
A few years later,
we rescued lcheb from the Borg.

17:32.785 --> 17:36.186
When l was little,
there was nothing l wanted more

17:36.255 --> 17:39.053
than to be the
Assistant Captain.

17:39.124 --> 17:42.753
We should get moving.

17:42.828 --> 17:43.590
Commander.

17:45.164 --> 17:46.893
ln case you were wondering,

17:46.965 --> 17:50.059
l never told Neelix
where you hid that cider.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.670
So why are we
looking for this...

18:01.780 --> 18:03.270
Seven in the cargo bay?

18:03.315 --> 18:05.010
She spent a lot
of time there.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.210
Working?

18:06.285 --> 18:08.185
Regenerating.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.396
Maybe you'd better fill me in.

18:23.802 --> 18:25.292
This looks like the time

18:25.404 --> 18:28.237
you forged a temporary
alliance with the Borg.

18:28.307 --> 18:30.400
What's happened
to this vessel?

18:31.977 --> 18:35.777
Captain Janeway...
meet Seven of Nine--

18:35.848 --> 18:37.679
Tertiary Adjunct

18:37.749 --> 18:39.376
of Unimatrix Zero One.

18:41.186 --> 18:44.178
When a Borg cube travels
through a transwarp corridor,

18:44.256 --> 18:45.883
the temporal stresses
are extreme.

18:46.024 --> 18:48.891
To keep the different sections
of the cube in temporal sync,

18:48.994 --> 18:52.020
we project a chroniton field
throughout the vessel.

18:52.097 --> 18:53.894
How?

18:54.032 --> 18:56.466
Each cube has
specially designed conduits.

18:56.568 --> 18:59.696
lf we install similar conduits
throughout this vessel

18:59.805 --> 19:02.569
then generate
a sufficiently powerful field,

19:02.674 --> 19:05.666
we may be able to force Voyager
back into temporal sync.

19:05.744 --> 19:08.144
Temporal sync with what?

19:08.213 --> 19:10.477
The vessel will return
to the moment

19:10.549 --> 19:12.813
of the original
chronokinetic surge.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.112
Since the surge will last
for six to seven seconds,

19:15.187 --> 19:16.449
Since the surge will last
for six to seven seconds,

19:16.522 --> 19:18.490
Commander Chakotay
will have a short time

19:18.557 --> 19:21.355
in which to try to counteract
the warp core reaction.

19:21.426 --> 19:23.451
Even if we could replicate
these conduits,

19:23.529 --> 19:26.521
we'd have no way to get them
through the temporal barriers.

19:26.598 --> 19:29.533
The bio-neural circuitry.

19:29.635 --> 19:30.761
Captain?

19:30.869 --> 19:32.837
lt runs through every
section of the ship,

19:32.938 --> 19:34.371
almost like
a nervous system.

19:34.439 --> 19:36.669
lf we could inject
the gel packs

19:36.742 --> 19:39.176
with your serum,
we could use them

19:39.244 --> 19:41.303
to transmit
the chroniton field.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.143
The warp core
could be recalibrated

19:43.215 --> 19:44.546
to generate that field.

19:44.616 --> 19:46.106
Work on it.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.086
Chakotay and l will see
about modifying the serum.

19:49.154 --> 19:50.416
Your plan is inefficient.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.081
Why?

19:52.157 --> 19:53.249
There are only two of you.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.417
lf l were to assimilate you

19:54.493 --> 19:55.619
into a small Borg collective,

19:55.694 --> 19:57.025
you could then
assimilate others.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.791
The work would proceed
more quickly.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.493
Sorry, but l like
my plan better.

20:02.601 --> 20:03.863
We'll be back.

20:11.243 --> 20:14.178
That was an interesting
experience.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.146
lf it makes you
feel any better,

20:16.215 --> 20:17.477
you're going to develop
quite a knack

20:17.549 --> 20:18.516
for dealing
with the Borg.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.415
You mean we're going
to be seeing more of them?

20:20.485 --> 20:22.953
We'll run into them
on a few occasions.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.648
Why do l get the feeling
that's an understatement?

20:25.724 --> 20:28.249
lt doesn't seem
like my first command

20:28.327 --> 20:30.591
is shaping up
the way l expected.

20:30.662 --> 20:33.961
''ln the middle of the
journey of our life,

20:34.032 --> 20:36.865
''l found myself astray
in a dark wood

20:36.969 --> 20:40.496
where the straight
road had been lost.''

20:40.606 --> 20:45.270
l didn't know Dante's lnferno
was on the Maquis reading list.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.211
Actually, l borrowed your copy.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.374
My fiancé gave me that book
as an engagement gift.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.418
l've never lent it to anyone.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.112
Not yet.

20:55.187 --> 20:58.213
Anyway, l agree with Dante.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.622
lf you always see
the road ahead of you,

21:00.692 --> 21:02.387
it's not worth the trip.

21:02.461 --> 21:06.056
A soldier and a philosopher.

21:06.131 --> 21:10.158
Your intelligence file
doesn't do you justice.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.067
l've replicated these belts
to resist the effects

21:13.138 --> 21:15.868
of the temporal barriers,
just like the hyposprays.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.910
l didn't realize you were
programmed to be so versatile.

21:18.977 --> 21:20.672
l wasn't, but when
you are thrown

21:20.746 --> 21:22.373
into the deep end
of the galaxy

21:22.447 --> 21:24.642
and left running
for as long as l've been,

21:24.716 --> 21:27.241
it helps to develop
a few extra subroutines.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.946
How long have you
been running?

21:29.021 --> 21:30.249
Almost three years--

21:30.322 --> 21:32.654
since our original
Doctor was killed.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.316
Killed? How?

21:34.393 --> 21:37.055
ln the incident that stranded us
here in the Delta Qua...

21:37.129 --> 21:39.097
Doctor.

21:40.699 --> 21:43.827
The Temporal Prime
Directive-- remember?

21:43.935 --> 21:45.732
Of course.

21:45.837 --> 21:49.534
l'm sorry.

21:49.608 --> 21:50.802
The Delta Quadrant?

21:50.876 --> 21:52.935
ls that what he
was about to say?

21:53.011 --> 21:54.239
Ready?

21:55.947 --> 21:58.882
l'll take the upper decks;
you take the lower.

21:58.950 --> 22:01.441
l don't think splitting up's
a good idea.

22:01.553 --> 22:02.918
We'll get the job done faster.

22:02.954 --> 22:04.114
As your First Officer,

22:04.189 --> 22:05.451
it's my duty to protect you.

22:05.524 --> 22:07.754
l know a lot more about
what's out there than you do,

22:07.826 --> 22:09.316
and we have no way
of communicating

22:09.394 --> 22:10.793
if something goes wrong.

22:10.862 --> 22:13.626
lt may take a little longer,
but we should go together.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.498
After you...

22:17.602 --> 22:18.830
Commander.

22:34.753 --> 22:37.313
Can l ask you something?

22:37.389 --> 22:40.415
l started off
with a crew of 153.

22:40.492 --> 22:42.960
l already know
l lost my Doctor.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.687
How many others?

22:44.763 --> 22:48.665
We'll suffer casualties
like any other starship,

22:48.734 --> 22:51.669
but you'll also gain
new crewmen as well.

22:51.737 --> 22:53.398
Like you.

22:53.505 --> 22:55.735
How do you get to be
my First Officer?

22:55.807 --> 22:58.435
Our crews will be
forced to work together

22:58.510 --> 22:59.943
after we get stranded.

23:00.011 --> 23:01.876
ln the Delta Quadrant?

23:01.980 --> 23:03.811
How does that happen?

23:05.317 --> 23:07.444
Are you sure
you want to know?

23:16.261 --> 23:18.525
Run!

23:23.535 --> 23:25.901
What the hell was that?

23:25.971 --> 23:27.939
A macrovirus--
they infected the ship

23:28.039 --> 23:30.507
a few years ago.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.338
lt sounds like it's going to be

23:32.411 --> 23:34.743
one disaster after another
on this ship.

23:34.813 --> 23:36.644
You once told me
that Starfleet Captains

23:36.715 --> 23:39.206
don't choose their missions,
the missions choose them.

23:39.284 --> 23:41.684
You're going to have
the opportunity to study things

23:41.753 --> 23:43.152
no human has ever seen before.

23:43.221 --> 23:47.021
lncluding some very large germs.

23:56.034 --> 23:59.003
A monochromatic environment?

23:59.104 --> 24:00.935
lt's called black and white.

24:01.039 --> 24:03.872
lt's one of Tom Paris'
holodeck programs.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.742
He based it on some old
science fiction serials.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.872
lnteresting technology.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.882
Captain Proton's rocket pack.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.882
Captain Proton?

24:14.019 --> 24:15.714
The savior of the universe.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.984
Doesn't sound like Mr. Paris'
tastes are very sophisticated.

24:19.057 --> 24:21.287
That's why we love
having him around.

24:21.359 --> 24:23.827
The access port
should be in there.

24:40.879 --> 24:43.143
Here. l think
l found the panel.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.910
Give me a hand.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.887
Halt

24:50.956 --> 24:52.924
in the name of Chaotica!

24:52.991 --> 24:54.424
Seize them!

24:54.493 --> 24:55.425
Oh, no.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.756
Computer, deactivate program.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.090
Unable to comply.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.095
Surrender.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.222
Holodeck controls are off-line.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.492
Hold on.

25:01.533 --> 25:02.761
Now, wait a minute.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.836
Seize! My liege!

25:04.903 --> 25:06.700
Do not resist.

25:06.805 --> 25:08.966
They were attempting

25:09.074 --> 25:11.406
to rob your laboratory!

25:11.476 --> 25:12.966
Fool!

25:13.044 --> 25:14.375
Don't you recognize

25:14.446 --> 25:18.405
the Queen of the Spider People?

25:20.352 --> 25:25.119
Arachnia... my bride.

25:25.190 --> 25:30.093
l knew you'd return
to me one day...

25:30.161 --> 25:33.460
so l could watch you die.

25:46.778 --> 25:49.645
Raise the lightning shield!

25:49.714 --> 25:51.944
Power the death ray!

25:52.083 --> 25:54.574
Her fleet may
be lurking nearby.

25:54.653 --> 25:56.177
We must defend ourselves.

25:56.254 --> 25:57.312
l'm open to suggestions.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.552
Our best bet is to play along.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.217
Don't let me stop you.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.023
l'm not the one
he's in love with.

26:04.095 --> 26:05.824
Arachnia...

26:05.964 --> 26:09.991
you beguiled me once
with your foul potions.

26:10.101 --> 26:13.264
Did you think you could toy
with my affections again?

26:13.371 --> 26:15.839
Were these characters
always this ridiculous?

26:15.941 --> 26:17.806
lf l order Lonzak

26:17.876 --> 26:19.810
to pull that lever,

26:19.878 --> 26:21.072
you'll never mock me again.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.779
Arachnia.

26:26.851 --> 26:30.548
Please, my liege.

26:30.622 --> 26:33.455
l meant it was ridiculous

26:33.525 --> 26:36.653
to think l would
ever try to deceive you.

26:36.728 --> 26:39.595
l've come to warn you

26:39.664 --> 26:41.996
of a fiendish plot.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.366
By aliens from
the Eighth Dimension.

26:49.741 --> 26:51.174
Eighth?

26:51.242 --> 26:53.676
Everyone knows there are only

26:53.745 --> 26:55.440
five dimensions.

26:58.016 --> 26:59.950
lf you don't believe us,

27:00.018 --> 27:03.249
examine their handiwork
for yourself.

27:03.321 --> 27:05.585
There's a hidden panel
over there,

27:05.657 --> 27:08.319
behind those rocks.

27:08.393 --> 27:09.690
Very well.

27:09.761 --> 27:11.661
l'll humor you.

27:11.730 --> 27:12.958
Lonzak!

27:20.905 --> 27:22.770
l've found it, Highness!

27:22.841 --> 27:25.275
They've sabotaged my laboratory.

27:25.343 --> 27:27.038
That vial you're holding--

27:27.112 --> 27:29.410
it's a neutralizing potion.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.745
lf you inject their device,

27:31.816 --> 27:34.182
you'll render it harmless.

27:43.628 --> 27:45.186
Release me,

27:45.263 --> 27:48.198
and l'll disarm
all their devices...

27:48.266 --> 27:49.028
throughout your realm.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.124
throughout your realm.

27:50.235 --> 27:53.602
Oh, Arachnia.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.470
You do love me.

27:59.477 --> 28:00.671
How could l resist

28:00.779 --> 28:03.839
your... magnetism?

28:03.882 --> 28:06.180
Or l, yours.

28:06.251 --> 28:10.085
Together, we'll rule the cosmos

28:10.155 --> 28:13.522
and grind our enemies into dust.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.364
lf we restore the timeline,

28:20.432 --> 28:23.868
remind me to cancel Mr. Paris'
holodeck privileges.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.170
What the hell's going on?

28:33.244 --> 28:36.111
And what are you
doing in that uniform?

28:36.181 --> 28:38.672
lt's a little complicated.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.014
l'm not going anywhere.

28:41.086 --> 28:44.988
Voyager's had an encounter
with an anomaly.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.581
lt's fractured the ship
into different time periods.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.183
We're trying to undo the damage,

28:49.260 --> 28:50.887
but we need access
to that panel.

28:53.031 --> 28:55.727
First, she destroys our only
way out of the Delta Quadrant,

28:55.800 --> 28:57.529
and now you're collaborating
with her?

28:57.635 --> 28:59.034
Try to understand.

28:59.104 --> 29:00.969
l'm from a time period
in your future

29:01.072 --> 29:03.097
when all of us
will be working together.

29:03.174 --> 29:05.005
That's pretty hard to believe.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.543
B'Elanna, l've never lied

29:06.611 --> 29:09.580
to you before,
and l'm not lying now.

29:30.001 --> 29:32.993
That woman blamed me
for stranding Voyager

29:33.104 --> 29:34.662
in the Delta Quadrant.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.001
She was angry.

29:36.074 --> 29:37.541
But was she right?

29:37.642 --> 29:40.110
You had good reasons
for doing what you did.

29:40.211 --> 29:41.872
What reasons?

29:42.013 --> 29:43.742
You were trying to save lives.

29:43.815 --> 29:46.113
Whose?

29:46.184 --> 29:48.618
An alien culture, the Ocampans.

29:50.922 --> 29:53.686
ln other words, l'm going
to choose to help strangers

29:53.758 --> 29:55.453
at the expense
of our own people.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.859
lt's not like you
to second-guess yourself.

29:57.929 --> 30:00.056
ln this case,

30:00.131 --> 30:02.998
l'm second-guessing a decision
l haven't made yet.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.944
Keep dispensing the netrazine
until we run out,

30:15.013 --> 30:17.573
then switch to the analeptics.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.276
Yes, Lieutenant.

30:19.350 --> 30:20.942
How did you get in here?

30:21.085 --> 30:22.575
There isn't time to explain.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.521
What happened
to these people?

30:25.590 --> 30:27.558
Radiation poisoning.

30:27.625 --> 30:30.651
The EPS relays overloaded
when we ran into the anomaly.

30:30.728 --> 30:32.958
We need the Doctor
and medical supplies,

30:33.031 --> 30:34.965
or we're going to have
a lot more casualties.

30:35.066 --> 30:36.863
l'm afraid that isn't
possible right now.

30:36.968 --> 30:38.435
Do the best you can.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.131
Yes, sir.

30:41.239 --> 30:44.106
There's an access
panel in the galley.

30:55.553 --> 30:57.578
Coffee, black.

30:57.655 --> 31:00.089
How do you know
how l like my coffee?

31:00.158 --> 31:01.352
Well, you haven't changed

31:01.426 --> 31:03.257
your standing order
in seven years.

31:03.328 --> 31:07.162
Thanks, it's just what l needed.

31:07.232 --> 31:08.859
Don't worry, Captain.

31:08.933 --> 31:10.730
You'll get us out of this.

31:10.835 --> 31:11.995
You always do.

31:13.104 --> 31:14.435
All done here.

31:14.505 --> 31:16.871
Captain.

31:16.941 --> 31:18.272
Tuvok?

31:24.482 --> 31:27.417
l am pleased you are here.

31:27.485 --> 31:29.146
l didn't think

31:29.220 --> 31:31.085
l would see you again.

31:33.157 --> 31:35.182
l want you to know,

31:35.260 --> 31:38.457
it has been an honor
to serve with you...

31:40.565 --> 31:43.329
and to be your friend.

31:45.103 --> 31:47.071
Mr. Paris!

31:56.948 --> 32:00.975
Live long and prosper.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.610
Deck 1 1.

32:33.818 --> 32:36.446
l can't let this happen,
not again.

32:36.521 --> 32:38.182
What are you talking about?

32:38.256 --> 32:40.554
Voyager getting stranded,
all these deaths

32:40.625 --> 32:42.490
this entire future--
it's my fault.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.619
l've got to do something
to change it.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.254
What do you have in mind?

32:46.331 --> 32:49.129
Maybe we can find a way to
modify Seven of Nine's plan.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.191
Put Voyager into temporal sync

32:51.269 --> 32:52.827
-with my time frame.
-Captain...

32:52.937 --> 32:54.370
Now that l know
what's going to happen,

32:54.439 --> 32:56.407
l could avoid getting trapped
in the Delta Quadrant

32:56.474 --> 32:57.702
in the first place.

32:57.775 --> 32:58.764
Halt turbolift.

32:58.876 --> 33:00.275
Seven's plan is
dangerous enough.

33:00.378 --> 33:01.845
Trying to alter it
is too risky.

33:01.913 --> 33:03.312
lt's worth the risk.

33:03.381 --> 33:04.746
lf Seven's idea works,

33:04.816 --> 33:06.647
Tuvok and those other crewmen
will be fine.

33:06.718 --> 33:09.186
They'll still be stuck
in the Delta Quadrant.

33:09.253 --> 33:11.312
lf a temporal anomaly
doesn't kill them,

33:11.389 --> 33:13.152
something else will-- the Borg,

33:13.224 --> 33:15.021
telepathic pitcher plants,
macroviruses.

33:15.093 --> 33:16.856
The Delta Quadrant
is a death trap.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.486
What about
the Temporal Prime Directive?

33:18.563 --> 33:20.155
To hell with it.

33:20.298 --> 33:24.234
With all due respect,
it's a little presumptuous

33:24.335 --> 33:26.633
to think you have the right
to change everyone's future.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.036
From what l've seen,
they'll thank me.

33:29.107 --> 33:30.768
All you've seen
are bits and pieces.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.571
You're not getting
the whole picture.

33:32.643 --> 33:33.701
Really?

33:33.778 --> 33:35.075
Just what am l missing?

33:35.146 --> 33:37.580
lt's not what, it's who.

33:37.648 --> 33:40.947
People like Seven of Nine,
a Borg drone

33:41.085 --> 33:43.246
who'll become a member
of this crew

33:43.321 --> 33:45.448
after you help her
recover her humanity.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.923
Or Tom Paris,
a former convict

33:47.992 --> 33:49.619
who'll be our pilot, chief medic

33:49.694 --> 33:51.355
and a husband
to B'Elanna Torres.

33:51.429 --> 33:54.296
That angry woman l just met?

33:54.365 --> 33:56.458
She's going to be
your Chief Engineer.

33:56.567 --> 33:59.798
Two crews, Maquis and Starfleet,
are going to become one,

33:59.904 --> 34:02.498
and they'll make as big
a mark on the Delta Quadrant

34:02.607 --> 34:04.234
as it'll make on them,

34:04.308 --> 34:06.276
by protecting people
like the Ocampans,

34:06.377 --> 34:08.504
curing diseases,
encouraging peace.

34:08.579 --> 34:10.376
Children like
Naomi and lcheb

34:10.447 --> 34:12.643
are going to grow up on
this ship and call it home.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.650
And we'll all be
following a Captain

34:14.719 --> 34:15.879
who sets a course for Earth

34:15.987 --> 34:18.251
and never stops believing
that we'll get there.

34:19.322 --> 34:22.121
Are you going to be
lecturing me like this

34:22.193 --> 34:23.888
for the next seven years?

34:23.960 --> 34:27.293
Don't worry, you'll always
get the last word.

34:27.364 --> 34:29.764
ln that case,
let's get back to work.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.635
So, who is this Seska?

34:34.705 --> 34:36.263
She was a member of my crew

34:36.373 --> 34:38.534
who turned out to
be a Cardassian spy.

34:38.609 --> 34:40.099
She made an alliance
with the Kazon

34:40.210 --> 34:41.610
and took over the ship.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.704
lt's all right, we got it back.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.304
Sounds like she's
not going to be

34:45.382 --> 34:46.748
as cooperative as the others.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.217
l suggest we take a page
out of your rule book.

34:49.286 --> 34:51.083
We try diplomacy.

34:51.155 --> 34:53.783
Fine, but the next page
in that book says

34:53.858 --> 34:56.952
that when diplomacy fails,
we need a backup plan.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.689
Something tells me
you already have one.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.425
We've already injected
the gel packs

35:01.532 --> 35:02.760
in the other time frames.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.358
That just leaves the ones here.

35:04.469 --> 35:07.836
lt's in both our
interests to work together.

35:08.906 --> 35:10.806
l agree.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.103
Let him go.

35:12.176 --> 35:14.610
You believe him?

35:14.679 --> 35:17.739
His story is too
preposterous to be a lie.

35:26.457 --> 35:29.654
l'll admit, it's an
ingenious solution.

35:29.727 --> 35:32.787
l'm glad you're cooperating.

35:32.864 --> 35:36.265
Oh, l believe in cooperation,
as long as it benefits me.

35:37.368 --> 35:38.835
You know,

35:38.903 --> 35:41.599
it's true what they say.

35:42.707 --> 35:45.369
What's that?

35:45.443 --> 35:48.071
Men just get more distinguished
as they get older.

35:48.146 --> 35:52.412
A few lines here,
a little gray there.

35:52.483 --> 35:55.043
lt adds character.

35:55.119 --> 35:57.952
Too bad their minds start to go.

35:58.022 --> 36:00.582
The last time you were here,
you had that nasty head injury

36:00.691 --> 36:02.556
and you mumbled
something about

36:02.593 --> 36:04.993
my taking over the
ship five years ago.

36:05.062 --> 36:06.086
lf that's true,

36:06.164 --> 36:07.722
then you're from
a future time frame,

36:07.798 --> 36:09.060
which means that at some point

36:09.133 --> 36:11.363
your crew is going
to regain control of Voyager.

36:11.469 --> 36:12.697
l can't allow that to happen.

36:12.803 --> 36:16.034
Step away from the console.

36:19.877 --> 36:21.640
An ingenious plan.

36:21.712 --> 36:23.304
lt just needs
a slight modification.

36:23.381 --> 36:24.405
What are you doing?

36:24.482 --> 36:27.007
Recalibrating your pulse
to bring the ship

36:27.084 --> 36:29.382
into temporal sync
with my time frame.

36:29.453 --> 36:30.317
That's not possible.

36:30.388 --> 36:31.787
When will you learn

36:31.856 --> 36:33.687
to stop underestimating me?

36:33.758 --> 36:35.783
lf you make even the
slightest miscalculation,

36:35.860 --> 36:37.760
you'll destroy the ship
and kill everyone.

36:37.828 --> 36:39.659
What other choice do l have?

36:39.730 --> 36:42.062
lf l can get Voyager
into my own time frame,

36:42.133 --> 36:45.000
then l'll be able to ensure
that you never retake the ship.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.165
Don't worry.

36:49.273 --> 36:51.332
l won't hurt you.

36:51.442 --> 36:54.411
You can start fresh with me.

36:54.478 --> 36:55.809
Sorry.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.405
That's not the future
l have in mind.

36:59.483 --> 37:02.213
ln that case...

37:03.888 --> 37:06.049
Good-bye, Chakotay.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.192
lt's too dangerous.

37:12.263 --> 37:13.195
There are too many variables.

37:13.264 --> 37:14.390
You're not pleading for your...

37:14.465 --> 37:15.193
Do it.

37:15.266 --> 37:16.392
l'm telling you,

37:16.500 --> 37:17.967
you're endangering
your own life.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.696
l'm touched by your concern.

37:43.861 --> 37:44.885
Stop.

37:47.698 --> 37:49.666
Put down your weapons.

37:49.734 --> 37:51.565
Don't listen to her.

37:51.669 --> 37:53.159
Your faithful First Officer

37:53.271 --> 37:55.296
isn't going to let you die.

37:55.406 --> 37:56.930
Are you?

38:00.945 --> 38:03.277
Very clever, Chakotay--

38:03.347 --> 38:04.939
inoculating them
with your serum.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.109
Well, now it's time
to inoculate my people,

38:07.184 --> 38:09.482
so we can have access
to the rest of the ship.

38:09.553 --> 38:11.145
l won't do that.

38:11.222 --> 38:13.747
Then you just
lost your Captain.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.689
Now drop your weapons.

38:21.766 --> 38:23.063
Thanks.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.243
Seska and the Kazon

38:34.312 --> 38:35.609
are secure in the
Jefferies tube.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.977
The last gel packs?

38:37.048 --> 38:38.310
They're ready.

38:38.382 --> 38:40.782
The rest of us should
return to our sections.

38:40.851 --> 38:42.876
After Chakotay initiates
the warp pulse,

38:43.020 --> 38:45.215
he should find himself
back at the moment

38:45.289 --> 38:47.814
Voyager encountered
the chronokinetic surge.

38:47.892 --> 38:49.860
He's only going to have
a few seconds

38:49.927 --> 38:51.656
to reset the deflector polarity.

38:51.729 --> 38:53.196
lf the timeline is restored,

38:53.264 --> 38:56.631
the rest of us should have no
memory of what's happened here.

38:56.701 --> 38:59.864
So l'd like to thank you now

38:59.970 --> 39:01.631
for putting
your doubts aside

39:01.739 --> 39:03.866
and helping me put mine aside
as well.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.441
Good luck to each of you.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.985
Mind if l ask you
one last question?

39:19.056 --> 39:20.353
Will l have to break

39:20.424 --> 39:23.188
the Temporal Prime
Directive to answer it?

39:23.260 --> 39:25.251
Maybe... just a little.

39:27.398 --> 39:30.026
For two people who
started off as enemies,

39:30.134 --> 39:33.194
it seems we get to know
each other pretty well.

39:33.304 --> 39:34.771
So l've been wondering...

39:36.741 --> 39:39.232
just how close do we get?

39:42.580 --> 39:43.740
Let's just say

39:43.814 --> 39:47.181
there are some barriers
we never cross.

39:53.457 --> 39:55.925
See you in the future.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.365
Ensign?

40:07.471 --> 40:09.632
Chakotay should be
initiating the pulse

40:09.740 --> 40:11.708
in ten seconds.

40:13.744 --> 40:18.909
Five, four, three, two...

40:29.794 --> 40:31.887
Reroute main power
to the deflector

40:31.962 --> 40:33.190
and set the polarity

40:33.264 --> 40:35.061
to the frequency
l'm inputting.

40:35.132 --> 40:36.497
Why?

40:36.567 --> 40:38.626
Have you ever heard
of a lightning rod?

40:38.736 --> 40:41.296
ln about three seconds,
we're going to need one.

40:46.076 --> 40:48.010
What is it?

40:48.112 --> 40:50.546
l don't know.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.206
Main power's being rerouted

40:52.283 --> 40:53.648
to the deflector dish.

40:53.717 --> 40:54.979
Who gave that order?

41:01.392 --> 41:03.690
Damage?

41:03.761 --> 41:06.821
The deflector's been burned out,

41:06.897 --> 41:08.421
but we're okay.

41:19.777 --> 41:21.176
Do you mind telling me

41:21.245 --> 41:23.406
why B'Elanna burned out
the deflector dish?

41:23.481 --> 41:25.244
Actually, l ordered her
to do it.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.510
Why?

41:26.584 --> 41:28.950
Trust me, it was better
than the alternative.

41:29.053 --> 41:30.953
Which was what, exactly?

41:31.088 --> 41:32.350
l can't tell you.

41:32.423 --> 41:33.822
Why not?

41:33.891 --> 41:35.756
The Temporal Prime Directive.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.658
B'Elanna's already got a team

41:38.729 --> 41:39.787
working on repairs.

41:39.864 --> 41:42.025
What do you say
we finish our dinner?

41:46.203 --> 41:47.727
Forget particle fountains

41:47.838 --> 41:49.396
and subspace inversions.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.475
There isn't
an anomaly scarier

41:51.575 --> 41:53.907
than a thunderstorm
on the plains,

41:53.978 --> 41:56.446
especially when
you're six years old.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.914
l remember watching
a bolt of lightning

41:58.983 --> 42:01.611
split an oak tree in
my grandfather's yard.

42:01.719 --> 42:04.119
l'd climbed it just
a few hours before.

42:04.154 --> 42:05.781
Good timing.

42:05.856 --> 42:07.255
So what would have happened

42:07.324 --> 42:09.417
if you hadn't turned
our deflector dish

42:09.493 --> 42:10.619
into a lightning rod?

42:10.694 --> 42:12.423
We've been down
this road before.

42:12.496 --> 42:13.758
Have we?

42:13.831 --> 42:17.267
You wanting answers to questions
you shouldn't ask.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.268
But something did happen...

42:19.336 --> 42:22.362
outside the normal
space-time continuum.

42:26.810 --> 42:28.038
lt's strange

42:28.112 --> 42:30.580
thinking there's a piece
of your life

42:30.648 --> 42:32.741
you don't know anything about.

42:32.816 --> 42:34.943
Sounds a lot like the future.

42:35.085 --> 42:36.313
Any predictions?

42:36.387 --> 42:40.551
Only that in a few minutes,
this bottle will be empty.

42:40.624 --> 42:42.615
Then maybe you should go
to the cargo bay

42:42.693 --> 42:43.751
and grab another one.

42:43.827 --> 42:46.557
How do you know
that's where l keep it?

42:46.630 --> 42:48.621
Oh, l can't tell you.

42:48.699 --> 42:49.893
Why not?

42:49.967 --> 42:52.435
Temporal Prime Directive.
