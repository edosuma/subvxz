00:02.620 --> 00:04.890
<i>In this world, in addition to adventurers</i>

00:04.890 --> 00:08.730
<i>and People of the Land, there are 
also groups called demi-humans.</i>

00:09.530 --> 00:10.740
<i>For example, the goblins.</i>

00:11.340 --> 00:15.180
<i>They have limited intelligence, 
but are hardy and breed quickly.</i>

00:15.180 --> 00:17.120
<i>And above all, they're cruel and wicked.</i>

00:19.190 --> 00:23.730
<i>An individual goblin is no match for an 
adventurer of intermediate strength or higher,</i>

00:24.340 --> 00:27.390
<i>but their numbers and variety 
are not to be underestimated.</i>

00:28.840 --> 00:33.240
<i>Most of their territory is in the 
northeast of the island chain.</i>

02:07.470 --> 02:09.200
Then, what should we do?

02:09.700 --> 02:14.150
I think it's a bad idea for us to attend only one.

02:14.430 --> 02:16.360
A banquet with Lord Darte,

02:16.720 --> 02:19.040
an evening party comprised 
primarily of young knights,

02:19.490 --> 02:23.950
and a dinner meeting with Count Kirino 
of Tsukuba and the Academic's Guild...

02:24.360 --> 02:27.580
The Academic's Guild is a little much for me.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.430
Same here.

02:28.950 --> 02:30.970
I'll handle that one.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.500
Crusty, why don't you take the 
party with the young knights?

02:36.040 --> 02:38.430
I'm sure you'll enjoy the dance.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.770
That isn't a bad idea.

02:43.420 --> 02:46.430
Then I'll take the banquet with Lord Darte.

02:46.650 --> 02:49.360
Will you be okay, Crusty?

02:49.360 --> 02:54.190
You'll have to deal with flattering 
lords and noble ladies.

02:55.290 --> 03:00.800
Lately, I've found a shield that's 
so durable, it's nigh-unbreakable.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.010
I'll be fine.

03:03.900 --> 03:04.980
A shield?

03:05.930 --> 03:11.880
<b>Shield and Freedom</b>

03:08.500 --> 03:09.950
Shield and Freedom.

03:16.090 --> 03:19.380
Lady Lenessia, it's almost bedtime.

03:21.530 --> 03:22.890
No, Elyssa...

03:23.210 --> 03:25.550
I'm not wearing the silk pajamas.

03:26.090 --> 03:27.570
Those are evil pajamas.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.020
Not this again.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.910
Then you'd prefer these?

03:34.830 --> 03:36.410
These are perfect!

03:36.410 --> 03:37.780
Flannel pajamas...

03:38.020 --> 03:40.370
Wear the silk ones once in a while.

03:40.370 --> 03:41.910
I'm the one who gets scolded.

03:41.910 --> 03:43.780
Sure, eventually.

03:45.180 --> 03:50.040
All the gentlemen call you the 
melancholy twilight princess, you know.

03:50.860 --> 03:53.550
I'm not melancholy. Merely gloomy.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.600
And it isn't twilight. I'm just unmotivated.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.590
You won't find a gentleman who will allow you

03:58.590 --> 04:00.970
to lie around all day and do nothing.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.550
Yes, but...

04:05.460 --> 04:07.710
I'm sorry, Lord Kiliva...

04:07.710 --> 04:10.090
But I have another engagement.

04:10.090 --> 04:11.810
Another engagement?

04:12.290 --> 04:15.130
Oh, with Princess Lenessia?

04:19.270 --> 04:21.010
A pleasure to meet you.

04:21.350 --> 04:23.730
I am the adventurer Crusty.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.540
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.020
What did you mean by an engagement?

04:29.540 --> 04:31.860
That was only an excuse.

04:31.860 --> 04:34.580
If it caused you any problem, I apologize.

04:34.820 --> 04:36.220
N-No...

04:37.430 --> 04:41.090
<i>He doesn't seem like a bad 
person... Merely a pain.</i>

04:41.500 --> 04:44.010
You were just thinking I'm a pain, weren't you?

04:46.580 --> 04:49.250
Not only that, but when our eyes first met,

04:49.250 --> 04:51.140
you thought, "What a bother."

04:51.670 --> 04:53.340
H-How...

04:53.910 --> 04:57.110
How did I know, indeed?

04:59.620 --> 05:01.540
<i>He can read my mind.</i>

05:02.430 --> 05:04.500
How about some tea?

05:04.500 --> 05:07.510
The lords have been chasing 
me around all day.

05:07.510 --> 05:09.160
B-But...

05:09.160 --> 05:12.120
I realize the prospect doesn't 
please you, but right now,

05:12.120 --> 05:15.500
I'm the subject of much scrutiny in the palace.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.290
If the two of us were to take tea together,

05:19.680 --> 05:21.560
it would give us an excuse

05:21.560 --> 05:24.130
to skip some of the ceremonies and tea parties.

05:24.980 --> 05:28.260
<i>H-He's a bad person!</i>

05:30.060 --> 05:32.220
Please be careful, Princess.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.520
You're right.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.320
He can tell what I'm thinking...

05:37.320 --> 05:38.880
That isn't what I mean!

05:39.750 --> 05:41.580
He's an adventurer.

05:41.580 --> 05:44.030
We don't know what they're like.

05:45.030 --> 05:45.840
Yeah.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.480
I don't like saying this,

05:48.850 --> 05:51.600
but you need to think more about your position

05:51.600 --> 05:53.560
as a member of Duke Cowen's family.

05:54.110 --> 05:55.460
Right.

06:00.010 --> 06:02.200
<i>A member of the duke's family, eh?</i>

06:06.870 --> 06:09.040
Beautiful, as always!

06:09.040 --> 06:10.880
How delicate!

06:15.300 --> 06:17.190
<i>Half of those compliments</i>

06:17.720 --> 06:20.230
<i>are more for my grandfather's sake than mine.</i>

06:24.300 --> 06:26.700
<i>With the right decoration, 
anyone can be beautiful.</i>

06:27.140 --> 06:29.610
<i>And I can't even dress myself...</i>

06:33.230 --> 06:35.420
<i>How long will this last?</i>

06:50.550 --> 06:52.390
Y-You win...

06:52.780 --> 06:56.010
What a splendid strike.

06:56.010 --> 06:58.120
I hope you can take some time to train me.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.500
A goodwill match?

07:02.500 --> 07:04.480
Yes, they invited me.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.960
That's surprising.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.120
What is?

07:08.460 --> 07:11.660
I thought you'd find such things tedious.

07:11.660 --> 07:12.680
Not at all.

07:12.680 --> 07:17.290
I wanted to know more about 
the People of the Land.

07:20.980 --> 07:22.090
<i>Liar.</i>

07:22.800 --> 07:25.250
<i>He's looking to see if any of us are good.</i>

07:27.180 --> 07:28.230
Crusty?

07:28.680 --> 07:31.260
Oh, that's Princess Lenessia.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.910
What did you think when you fought them?

07:33.910 --> 07:35.990
You're an adventurer.

07:35.990 --> 07:38.070
None of them is likely to 
be stronger than you.

07:38.070 --> 07:40.580
No, they were all quite talented.

07:41.050 --> 07:42.900
That last fight was close.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.180
I see.

07:46.120 --> 07:46.960
Yes...

07:46.960 --> 07:50.530
It's difficult to fight your way 
up and rank first here...

07:52.610 --> 07:53.890
Princess Lenessia?

07:55.460 --> 07:56.560
Y-Yes?

07:57.120 --> 08:03.040
Princess, would you please give a reward 
to the strongest of these brave knights?

08:03.390 --> 08:04.400
A reward?

08:05.050 --> 08:09.580
The right to accompany you 
to this evening's party.

08:10.820 --> 08:12.550
Th-That's great!

08:12.550 --> 08:14.300
Okay! I'll do my best!

08:22.230 --> 08:23.370
I understand.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.020
That's quite a shield.

08:26.540 --> 08:31.420
But what does Duke Cowen intend 
to do with the adventurers?

08:31.420 --> 08:34.070
Who knows if negotiation with 
them is even possible?

08:34.530 --> 08:37.950
By the way, have we still not heard 
where the Izumo Knights are?

08:38.390 --> 08:41.140
We could just use the adventurers for that.

08:41.140 --> 08:43.600
After all, they're immortal.

08:44.810 --> 08:47.840
Oh, hello, you two...

08:49.760 --> 08:50.920
I found you!

08:51.510 --> 08:52.990
It's that hide-and-seek genius.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.550
Come play hide-and-seek with us!

08:57.750 --> 08:59.810
She really is good at hide-and-seek!

09:00.600 --> 09:02.230
I'm not playing hide-and-seek.

09:03.830 --> 09:08.570
Your theory denies the possibility that 
the People of the Land can progress!

09:08.570 --> 09:12.740
Your refusal to admit the possibility of 
my theory is hindering <i>our</i> progress!

09:12.740 --> 09:15.330
What does progress even mean?

09:15.330 --> 09:18.490
Isn't that where we should start?

09:18.630 --> 09:20.720
That is merely running away from the issue!

09:18.980 --> 09:22.090
I guess there are heated debates in every world.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.090
What?!

09:22.090 --> 09:23.010
Is that your answer?

09:23.010 --> 09:25.580
I'm thinking of all the People 
of the Land when I say...

09:25.580 --> 09:26.730
Shiroe?

09:26.730 --> 09:27.750
Minori?

09:28.510 --> 09:31.020
I'm heading into the dungeon now...

09:31.570 --> 09:33.770
Can we talk for a while?

09:34.390 --> 09:36.260
Oh, sorry...

09:36.800 --> 09:38.870
I'm right in the midst of a conference.

09:39.220 --> 09:41.400
Huh? Of course!

09:41.400 --> 09:42.380
I'm sorry...

09:42.380 --> 09:43.570
I'll be fine.

09:43.570 --> 09:44.740
I'll talk to you later.

10:17.020 --> 10:19.530
Y-You win.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.100
Amazing!

10:23.610 --> 10:26.470
<i>Well, naturally, he was going to win.</i>

10:39.170 --> 10:43.120
Facing so many renowned knights is tiring.

10:43.950 --> 10:45.590
Was that sarcasm?

10:45.590 --> 10:47.200
Of course not.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.830
Wake me up in a while.

10:52.830 --> 10:55.220
But... What if someone sees you?

10:55.220 --> 10:56.420
I don't care.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.630
I'm only a barbaric adventurer, after all.

10:59.450 --> 11:03.120
I'm sure the lords would accept it as natural.

11:05.210 --> 11:06.650
<i>Somehow, it isn't fair.</i>

11:06.650 --> 11:08.380
You just thought it isn't fair, didn't you?

11:10.250 --> 11:11.750
Why not join me?

11:12.370 --> 11:14.950
The table is cool, and it feels nice.

11:21.810 --> 11:24.100
So you're saying, it's that?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.160
Yes, that it is.

11:29.530 --> 11:31.790
Adventurers are free.

11:32.210 --> 11:33.250
Free?

11:33.710 --> 11:35.150
They can eat when they like,

11:35.150 --> 11:36.820
sleep when they like,

11:36.820 --> 11:38.950
and move when they like.

11:39.890 --> 11:40.760
But...

11:41.790 --> 11:43.940
Being free takes resolve.

11:48.050 --> 11:49.020
<i>Free...</i>

12:07.530 --> 12:08.390
Here!

12:22.350 --> 12:24.260
An hour in, and look at us...

12:25.870 --> 12:27.570
We've done this over and over.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.370
Why can't we win?!

12:30.440 --> 12:35.010
I'm taking damage because 
you guys aren't healing right.

12:35.010 --> 12:36.820
Don't talk that way!

12:36.820 --> 12:38.400
Everyone's doing their jobs!

12:38.620 --> 12:40.920
Then why is this happening?

12:41.590 --> 12:44.410
Why am I so weak?

12:45.060 --> 12:47.630
I'm at level 24.

12:47.630 --> 12:49.870
The enemies range from levels 17 to 21...

12:49.870 --> 12:52.380
So why is it this hard?

12:52.770 --> 12:54.420
This doesn't make sense!

12:54.860 --> 12:55.920
It's because...

12:59.240 --> 13:02.030
It's because you aren't fighting 
at your full potential!

13:03.610 --> 13:07.060
Do I just need to keep training?

13:08.760 --> 13:11.430
Will those kids be okay?

13:12.090 --> 13:15.190
It's been four days since they entered the dungeon.

13:15.710 --> 13:17.380
It's fine.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.820
You worry too much.

13:20.620 --> 13:24.330
But what if something happens, 
and they get sent back to Akihabara?

13:24.330 --> 13:27.320
Then we'll use our griffins to retrieve them.

13:27.950 --> 13:30.440
You talk like it's not your problem...

13:30.440 --> 13:34.600
They say lions toss their own 
cubs off cliffs, right?

13:35.600 --> 13:38.060
Oh, but that isn't true.

13:38.880 --> 13:41.530
You won't surpass the dungeon teams like that!

13:41.930 --> 13:42.960
Fight harder!

13:43.800 --> 13:46.220
Either way, being overprotective won't help.

13:46.860 --> 13:50.220
The point of this training camp is 
to help them gain experience.

13:51.310 --> 13:52.770
You're right.

13:52.770 --> 13:53.850
Got it.

13:53.850 --> 13:55.980
I'll believe in them.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.010
Well, I think I'll eat some crab.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.230
Thanks!

14:06.590 --> 14:08.610
The big ones are bland.

14:09.060 --> 14:09.990
Yeah.

14:10.270 --> 14:14.140
The new kids get training, 
and I get to eat crab.

14:14.140 --> 14:15.870
Two birds with one stone!

14:21.280 --> 14:23.760
Shouryuu, what's that?

14:24.430 --> 14:25.680
I don't know.

14:26.000 --> 14:26.840
Bubbles?

14:27.460 --> 14:28.260
They disappeared?

14:30.380 --> 14:32.160
What was that?

14:34.260 --> 14:36.600
How do you like it?

14:36.600 --> 14:41.400
This meat is known as the best in my domain.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.490
It's delicious.

14:46.890 --> 14:49.280
I've sent for some chefs, myself.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.570
Next time, I'll invite you.

14:51.940 --> 14:53.910
I look forward to that.

14:53.910 --> 14:57.080
I've heard many rumors about it.

14:57.520 --> 15:02.980
This revolution has greatly 
affected our eating habits.

15:02.980 --> 15:06.340
Everyone's in love with the new food.

15:06.650 --> 15:12.140
The people of our domain are more 
motivated to find good food, as well.

15:12.140 --> 15:14.850
Production has elevated in a number of areas.

15:17.370 --> 15:20.340
We've begun to be more careful in raising,

15:20.340 --> 15:24.050
harvesting, and transporting it.

15:24.050 --> 15:25.110
I'm glad to hear that.

15:25.390 --> 15:28.610
But there's one problem...

15:28.890 --> 15:29.610
Problem?

15:30.150 --> 15:36.080
Raising lots of food and transporting 
it as far as possible

15:36.080 --> 15:39.460
makes many people happy,

15:39.460 --> 15:41.900
and it enriches the domain.

15:42.580 --> 15:46.010
But transporting it over land means...

15:46.520 --> 15:48.510
Monsters, right?

15:48.680 --> 15:50.100
Indeed.

15:51.310 --> 15:54.390
And so, I have a request, Michitaka...

15:55.670 --> 15:57.550
You want us to defeat the goblins?

15:58.220 --> 16:02.040
No, there's something else we wish to request.

16:03.990 --> 16:07.230
The technology to transport goods by sea.

16:18.050 --> 16:20.430
Princess Lenessia's sad expression...

16:20.850 --> 16:23.710
She must be troubled by the world's future.

16:24.060 --> 16:25.920
I know it's a bother,

16:26.940 --> 16:29.090
but you'll have to smile a little.

16:30.170 --> 16:33.430
It must be suffocating, 
hearing the young knights' flattery.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.930
I think we have the same interests here.

16:37.860 --> 16:39.390
I know that.

16:42.580 --> 16:44.470
Princess Lenessia!

16:44.470 --> 16:48.430
I'm sorry to interrupt your chat.

16:48.430 --> 16:51.320
May we join you?

16:51.690 --> 16:53.820
We brought cookies!

16:56.020 --> 16:58.320
<i>I think they're nice girls, but...</i>

16:59.190 --> 17:03.700
We saw you fight with your sword!

17:03.700 --> 17:05.480
You're strong, aren't you?

17:05.480 --> 17:07.900
No, I still have much to learn.

17:07.900 --> 17:09.610
Don't be so humble.

17:09.610 --> 17:11.740
It took my breath away!

17:11.740 --> 17:14.820
I'm unworthy of praise from such beautiful ladies.

17:15.270 --> 17:16.590
Thank you.

17:17.180 --> 17:19.850
<i>Why is he so polite to these two,</i>

17:19.850 --> 17:21.960
<i>and so rude to me?</i>

17:22.530 --> 17:24.940
Crusty, you're special!

17:24.940 --> 17:28.230
Of the adventurers, you're the 
most elegant and noble!

17:28.710 --> 17:29.750
Yes...

17:29.750 --> 17:32.410
We've all been talking about you.

17:33.130 --> 17:35.240
I'm very honored.

17:35.560 --> 17:39.250
No, that dignified elegance 
is why Princess Lenessia

17:39.250 --> 17:42.260
allows you to accompany her.

17:42.990 --> 17:45.260
Isn't that right, Princess?

17:45.490 --> 17:47.470
Y-Yes, of course.

17:48.060 --> 17:50.250
<i>I w-wonder what they're talking about.</i>

17:50.650 --> 17:53.310
Princess Lenessia is so beautiful.

17:53.310 --> 17:55.490
Accompanying her must be fun!

17:56.060 --> 17:57.990
She is a kind, compassionate person.

17:58.580 --> 18:01.660
Her kindness allows a newcomer like myself

18:01.660 --> 18:03.020
to remain in her company.

18:05.530 --> 18:08.200
I am unfamiliar with courtly etiquette,

18:08.200 --> 18:13.280
and she allows me to avoid looking 
like a country bumpkin.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.400
It is an honor of which I am unworthy.

18:19.220 --> 18:20.160
<i>He's a bad person.</i>

18:20.900 --> 18:22.690
<i>He's a really bad person!</i>

18:24.300 --> 18:27.870
Then, we'll introduce you to everyone.

18:27.870 --> 18:30.500
Once they get to know you,

18:30.500 --> 18:32.920
no one will mistake you for a bumpkin.

18:33.370 --> 18:36.800
No, I am a barbarian who knows only war.

18:37.620 --> 18:41.390
Until I repay the princess for the 
kindness she's shown to me,

18:41.390 --> 18:43.770
I cannot leave her side.

18:46.650 --> 18:48.440
<i>What is his problem?</i>

18:49.330 --> 18:51.180
A knight serving his lady!

18:51.180 --> 18:52.560
How wonderful...

18:55.390 --> 18:56.820
Feel free

18:57.190 --> 19:02.280
to leave me behind and look at 
the pretty palace flowers instead.

19:02.890 --> 19:07.210
I already have my hands full with 
a single beautiful flower.

19:07.630 --> 19:11.330
But you know exactly how 
to handle girls, don't you?

19:12.640 --> 19:14.090
It depends on the girl.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.880
In my hometown, I have a younger sister,

19:18.880 --> 19:21.440
so girls like you are easier for me to handle.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.350
A-Am I like your sister?

19:26.770 --> 19:27.680
Yes.

19:28.410 --> 19:31.470
Can you not see her?

19:32.110 --> 19:34.610
At the moment, it would be difficult.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.540
You... miss her?

19:38.720 --> 19:39.880
I couldn't say.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.230
<i>He's...</i>

19:44.920 --> 19:47.870
Looking at you reminds me of her.

19:48.250 --> 19:51.480
Putting your cheek against 
the table to feel its chill,

19:51.480 --> 19:54.300
lying around all day if you let her,

19:54.300 --> 19:56.500
only wearing the most comfortable clothes...

19:56.500 --> 19:57.590
You're just like her.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.690
Y-You haven't seen me do all that!

19:59.690 --> 20:01.460
How do you know?

20:01.460 --> 20:03.330
Because you're like her.

20:03.800 --> 20:09.020
In many ways, being around 
you eases my tired heart.

20:09.980 --> 20:13.640
Please give me the chance to repay 
you during the conference.

20:14.810 --> 20:16.830
You scratch my back, and I scratch yours?

20:17.610 --> 20:19.400
Give and take.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.040
Very well, then.

20:38.910 --> 20:39.930
<i>A handshake?</i>

20:58.700 --> 21:00.430
One, two, three...

21:00.900 --> 21:03.030
One, two, three...

21:03.770 --> 21:05.630
Akatsuki, aren't you going to sleep?

21:06.870 --> 21:08.080
My lord...

21:08.080 --> 21:09.450
H-How long were you there?

21:09.660 --> 21:11.270
Um...

21:11.270 --> 21:12.410
I just arrived.

21:14.930 --> 21:15.920
Want some?

21:17.290 --> 21:20.020
The Academic's Guild finally released me...

21:20.370 --> 21:23.490
They kept pestering me to let 
them research adventurers.

21:23.860 --> 21:24.930
I see.

21:27.190 --> 21:29.060
<i>His hair swirls to the right.</i>

21:29.500 --> 21:30.430
<i>It's cute.</i>

21:30.700 --> 21:33.020
Well? Did you learn anything?

21:33.610 --> 21:38.380
People of the Land see us as potential enemies, 
but they mean us no direct harm.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.940
Their opinion of us is about half favorable.

21:40.310 --> 21:41.650
Oh...

21:42.250 --> 21:45.070
I believe they see us as potential 
enemies because of our power.

21:45.750 --> 21:49.980
Neither of us has a real idea as 
to what the other is capable of...

21:50.630 --> 21:54.330
They're probably debating whether to defeat 
us by surprise or do everything we say.

21:55.470 --> 21:57.080
Anything else?

21:57.690 --> 21:59.160
Come to think of it,

21:59.160 --> 22:02.340
they also mentioned something about still 
not knowing where the Izumo Knights are.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.360
The Izumo Knights?

22:15.020 --> 22:18.900
You must be Shiroe, of Log Horizon.

22:18.900 --> 22:23.230
I've come to speak with you tonight.

22:23.980 --> 22:24.990
Who are you?

22:25.600 --> 22:31.990
I am the mage Regan, of Miral Lake.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.170
That day, everything changed.

24:08.170 --> 24:10.510
That day, I suddenly found myself here.

24:10.510 --> 24:14.400
That day, the Apocalypse descended 
on tens of thousands of people.

24:14.400 --> 24:18.270
The Mage of Eternal Eyes, Regan, 
speaks regarding its secrets.

24:18.700 --> 24:21.840
Shiroe learns the rules that govern 
the lives of adventurers.

24:22.230 --> 24:29.990
<b>World Fraction</b>

24:22.350 --> 24:24.500
Next time: World Fraction.

24:24.790 --> 24:27.250
Always look thirty seconds ahead.
