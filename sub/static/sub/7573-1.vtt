03:01.202 --> 03:03.727
Come for me!

03:33.768 --> 03:38.738
You're gaining on it, Johnny.

03:38.773 --> 03:41.741
Am I, father? Am I really?

03:41.776 --> 03:44.768
Off you go now.
Run along and practice.

04:13.707 --> 04:17.711
He'll make a good king.
He'll be ready.

04:17.745 --> 04:20.737
That's the way.
Come on, my son!

04:23.751 --> 04:25.718
Have you found religion,
Henry?

04:25.753 --> 04:29.757
Will you look down from heaven and
see who's sitting on your throne?

04:29.792 --> 04:32.725
I must know before I die.

04:32.760 --> 04:37.765
There's a legend of a king called
Lear, with whom I have a lot in common.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.768
Both of us have kingdoms
and three children we adore,

04:40.803 --> 04:43.736
and both of us are old,
but there it ends.

04:43.771 --> 04:46.739
He cuts his kingdom into bits.
I can't do that.

04:46.774 --> 04:49.777
I've built an empire, and
I must know it's going to last.

04:49.812 --> 04:51.744
All of Britain,
half of France...

04:51.779 --> 04:55.772
I'm the greatest power in a thousand
years, and after me comes John.

05:02.723 --> 05:05.715
I'm going to lose you,
Henry, aren't I?

05:06.727 --> 05:09.695
Alais, in my time I've known...

05:09.730 --> 05:12.733
contessas, milkmaids,
courtesans...

05:12.768 --> 05:15.736
and novices,
whores, gypsies, jades...

05:15.771 --> 05:18.704
and little boys,

05:18.739 --> 05:23.733
but nowhere in God's western world
have I found anyone to love but you.

05:24.745 --> 05:26.712
And Rosamund?

05:26.747 --> 05:30.245
- She's dead.
- And Eleanor.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.743
The new Medusa,
my good wife?

05:34.755 --> 05:37.758
How is your queen?
Decaying, I suppose.

05:37.793 --> 05:40.778
No, don't be jealous
of the Gorgon.

05:40.813 --> 05:43.729
She is not
among the things I love.

05:43.764 --> 05:47.733
How many husbands do you know
who dungeon up their wives?

05:47.768 --> 05:53.774
I haven't kept the great bitch in the keep
for ten years out of passionate attachment.

05:53.809 --> 05:58.768
- There's Captain Marshal.
William!

06:00.714 --> 06:03.216
We will be holding
Christmas court at chinon.

06:03.251 --> 06:05.684
We have asked the king of France
to join us.

06:05.719 --> 06:10.724
I want Richard there and Geoffrey.
Go find my boys and tell them.

06:10.759 --> 06:12.726
Then go fetch the queen
from Salisbury tower.

06:12.761 --> 06:16.695
If the queen refuses?
Eleanor?

06:16.730 --> 06:19.722
She wouldn't miss this
for the world.

07:20.728 --> 07:22.724
Richard.

07:22.759 --> 07:24.721
Richard!

07:30.738 --> 07:34.731
Hello, Richard.

08:45.946 --> 08:47.743
Forward!

09:24.718 --> 09:26.049
Forward!

10:12.266 --> 10:14.257
Geoffrey?

10:15.769 --> 10:17.259
Geoffrey.

10:19.306 --> 10:21.740
Geoffrey!

10:21.775 --> 10:23.766
Father wants to see me.

10:48.802 --> 10:50.793
Your majesty.

10:53.807 --> 10:56.810
There's to be
a Christmas court.

10:56.845 --> 10:58.877
Yes, madam.

10:58.912 --> 11:01.847
Where?
At chinon.

12:06.046 --> 12:10.083
Henry, what if, just for once,
I didn't do as I was told?

12:10.118 --> 12:12.718
It's going to be
a jungle of a day.

12:12.753 --> 12:15.085
If I start growling now,
I'll never last.

12:15.756 --> 12:17.121
You'll last.

12:17.758 --> 12:20.750
You're like the rocks at
stonehenge... nothing knocks you down.

12:26.133 --> 12:30.170
In these rooms, Alais, on this
Christmas, I have all the enemies I need.

12:30.205 --> 12:34.174
You have more than you think.
Are you one?

12:34.209 --> 12:37.200
Has my willow
turned to poison oak?

12:37.778 --> 12:40.781
If I decided to be trouble,
Henry, how much trouble could I be?

12:40.816 --> 12:43.215
Not much.

12:43.784 --> 12:46.520
I could give away your plans.
You don't know what they are.

12:46.555 --> 12:49.256
I know you want to disinherit
Richard. So does Eleanor.

12:49.291 --> 12:51.247
She knows young Henry's dead.

12:51.792 --> 12:55.262
The young king died in summer, and I haven't
named an heir. She knows I want John...

12:55.297 --> 12:58.799
on the throne, and I know she wants
Richard... we are very frank about it.

12:58.834 --> 13:01.734
Henry, I can't be your mistress
if I'm married to your son.

13:01.969 --> 13:03.732
Why can't you?
Johnny wouldn't mind.

13:04.237 --> 13:06.489
I do not like your Johnny.
He's a good boy.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.634
He's got pimples,
and he smells of compost.

13:08.669 --> 13:10.744
He's just 16!
He can't help the pimples.

13:10.779 --> 13:14.271
He could have a bath!

13:14.748 --> 13:17.317
It isn't such a dreadful thing
to be queen of England.

13:17.352 --> 13:19.319
Not all eyes will weep for you.

13:19.354 --> 13:22.056
Will yours?
I don't know.

13:22.091 --> 13:24.723
Very likely.

13:24.758 --> 13:28.562
All I want is not to lose you.
Can't you hide me?

13:28.597 --> 13:32.331
Can't I simply disappear?
You know you can't.

13:32.366 --> 13:37.404
Your little brother Philip's king of France now,
and he wants your wedding or your dowry back.

13:37.439 --> 13:40.739
I only took you for your
dowry. You were seven...

13:40.774 --> 13:45.779
two big knees and two big eyes,
and that's all.

13:45.814 --> 13:47.770
How was I to know?

13:51.451 --> 13:55.785
Hey. What's the matter, lad? Nothing.

14:16.476 --> 14:20.479
- Geoff!
- Johnny!

14:20.514 --> 14:23.506
Is that for me?
I love Christmas.

14:29.556 --> 14:31.723
What difference does
my dowry make?

14:31.758 --> 14:35.558
Let Philip have it back.
It isn't much. I can't.

14:35.762 --> 14:40.597
The vexin is a little county,
but it's vital to me. And I'm not.

14:40.767 --> 14:43.759
It's been my luck to fall
in love with landed women.

14:44.604 --> 14:46.738
When I married Eleanor
I thought, "you lucky man.

14:46.773 --> 14:49.640
"The richest woman in the
world... she owns the Aquitaine,

14:49.776 --> 14:53.644
the greatest province in the
continent, and beautiful as well."

14:54.781 --> 14:58.650
She was, you know.
And you adored her.

14:58.685 --> 15:03.622
Memory fails. There may
have been an era when I did.

15:03.724 --> 15:08.718
Let's have one strand askew. Nothing
in life has any business being perfect.

15:11.665 --> 15:15.669
If I say you and I are done,
we're done.

15:15.704 --> 15:19.740
If I say marry John,
it's John.

15:19.775 --> 15:22.674
I'll have you by me,

15:22.709 --> 15:25.701
and I'll use you as I like.

15:36.757 --> 15:39.760
Ah, Christmas...
warm and rosy time.

15:39.795 --> 15:42.280
The hot wine steams,
the yule log roars,

15:42.315 --> 15:44.730
and we're the fat
that's in the fire.

15:44.765 --> 15:46.732
She'll be here soon,
you know. Who? Mother.

15:46.767 --> 15:51.772
She still want you to be king? We
are not as friendly as we used to be.

15:51.807 --> 15:53.763
If I'm supposed to make a fuss
and kiss her hairy cheek, I won't.

15:54.007 --> 15:56.771
What you kiss,
little prince, is up to you.

15:57.778 --> 15:59.745
I'm father's favorite.
That's what counts.

15:59.780 --> 16:03.750
You hardly know me, Johnny, so I
beg you to believe my reputation.

16:03.785 --> 16:07.721
I am a constant soldier, a
sometime poet, and I will be king.

16:07.756 --> 16:10.736
Just you remember...
father loves me best.

16:10.771 --> 16:13.716
Why John? John doesn't
care for you at all.

16:14.728 --> 16:17.731
We love each other deeply. None
of them has any love for you.

16:17.766 --> 16:20.699
Because we fight?

16:20.734 --> 16:25.739
Tell me all three want the crown. I'll
tell you it's a feeble prince that doesn't.

16:25.774 --> 16:30.744
They may snap at me and plot, and that
makes them the kind of sons I want.

16:30.779 --> 16:33.712
I've snapped and plotted
all my life.

16:33.747 --> 16:37.751
There's no other way to be a
king, alive and 50 all at once.

16:37.786 --> 16:40.743
I'm going to fight for you.
Oh, fine.

18:50.183 --> 18:54.745
How was your crossing?
Did the channel part for you?

18:55.755 --> 18:58.724
It went flat when I told it to.

18:58.759 --> 19:01.693
I didn't think to ask for more.

19:08.768 --> 19:13.762
How dear of you to let me out of
jail. It's only for the holidays.

19:14.207 --> 19:19.702
Like school, you keep me young.
Here's gentle Alais.

19:20.814 --> 19:24.716
No,
greet me as you used to.

19:25.719 --> 19:27.786
Fragile I am not.

19:27.821 --> 19:31.723
Affection is a pressure
I can bear.

19:32.726 --> 19:36.730
Oh, but I do have
handsome children.

19:36.765 --> 19:40.699
John, you're so clean and neat.

19:40.734 --> 19:43.702
Henry takes good care of you.
And Richard.

19:43.737 --> 19:46.900
Don't look sullen, dear. It makes
your eyes go small and piggy...

19:47.741 --> 19:49.943
and your chin look weak.

19:49.978 --> 19:52.711
Geoffrey.

19:52.746 --> 19:54.737
Is Philip here yet?
Not yet.

19:54.948 --> 19:56.745
Let's hope he's
grown up like his father...

19:56.950 --> 19:59.951
Simon pure and Simon simple...
good, good, Louis.

19:59.986 --> 20:03.757
If I had managed sons for him
instead of all those little girls,

20:03.792 --> 20:05.992
I'd still be stuck
with being queen of France,

20:06.027 --> 20:08.727
and we should not have
known each other.

20:08.762 --> 20:12.027
Such, my angels,
is the role of sex in history.

20:14.034 --> 20:16.764
Thatwill be Philip.

20:18.772 --> 20:21.039
Where's Henry?
Upstairs with the family whore.

20:21.074 --> 20:24.778
That's a mean and tawdry way
to talk about your fiancee.

20:24.813 --> 20:27.045
My fiancee.
Whosever fiancee.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.599
I brought her up, and she
is dear to me and gentle.

20:29.634 --> 20:32.083
He still plans to make John
king. Of course he does.

20:32.118 --> 20:36.755
My, what a greedy little trinity
you are... king, king, king.

20:36.790 --> 20:39.782
Two of you must learn to live with
disappointment. Ah, but which two?

20:40.160 --> 20:42.127
Let's deny them all
and live forever.

20:42.162 --> 20:45.154
Tusk to tusk
through all eternity.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.791
Ah, my boys.

20:49.202 --> 20:52.205
The king of France and I will
shortly have a tactile conversation,

20:52.240 --> 20:54.172
like two surgeons
looking for a lump.

20:54.207 --> 20:57.811
We'll state positions, and I'll make the first
of many offers. He'll refuse it, naturally.

20:57.846 --> 21:00.746
I'll make a better one, and so on
through the holidays until I win.

21:01.181 --> 21:05.743
For the duration of this joyous ritual
you will give to your father your support.

21:55.802 --> 21:58.794
- My lord!
- Your grace!

21:59.839 --> 22:02.364
Welcome to chinon.

22:11.417 --> 22:14.750
Ah, that's better.

22:18.758 --> 22:22.727
I was told you were impressive
for a boy of 17.

22:22.762 --> 22:26.459
- I'm Eleanor, who might have been your mother.
- queen Eleanor.

22:26.766 --> 22:28.733
All the others here you know.

22:28.768 --> 22:31.760
I gather you're disturbed
about your sister and her dowry.

22:32.105 --> 22:34.739
Sixteen years ago
you made a treaty with us.

22:34.774 --> 22:37.766
- It is time its terms were executed.
- I should think so.

22:38.144 --> 22:40.512
Our position comes to this:

22:40.547 --> 22:44.050
That you will either hold the
marriage or return the vexin.

22:44.085 --> 22:47.554
Alais marries Richard, or we'll
have the county back at once.

22:47.589 --> 22:49.789
That's clear, concise
and well presented.

22:49.824 --> 22:52.557
My position...

22:52.592 --> 22:54.759
well, frankly, Philip,
it's a tangle.

22:54.794 --> 22:57.797
Two years ago, the queen and I...
for reasons passing understanding...

22:57.832 --> 23:00.195
gave the Aquitaine to Richard.

23:00.230 --> 23:02.558
That makes Richard
very powerful.

23:02.735 --> 23:04.702
How can I give him Alais too?

23:04.737 --> 23:07.539
The man she marries
has you for an ally.

23:07.574 --> 23:11.601
It's their wedding or the vexin back.
Those are the terms you made with Louis.

23:11.744 --> 23:14.579
True, but academic, lad.
The vexin's mine.

23:14.614 --> 23:17.742
By what authority? It's got my troops
all over it. That makes it mine.

23:19.652 --> 23:21.619
Now, hear me, boy.

23:21.654 --> 23:25.723
I am a king. I am no man's boy. A king?

23:25.758 --> 23:28.659
Because you put your ass
on purple cushions?

23:28.761 --> 23:32.730
- Sir.
- Philip.

23:32.765 --> 23:35.763
You haven't got
the feel of this at all, lad.

23:35.798 --> 23:38.762
Use all your voices.
When I bellow, bellow back.

23:39.772 --> 23:44.744
I'll mark that down.
This too:

23:44.779 --> 23:46.744
We are the world in small.

23:46.779 --> 23:49.771
A nation is a human thing. It
does what we do, for our reasons.

23:50.783 --> 23:52.785
Surely if we're civilized,
we can put away the knives.

23:52.820 --> 23:56.754
We can make peace.
We have it in our hands.

23:56.789 --> 24:00.692
I've tutors of my own.
Will that be all? Oh, think.

24:00.727 --> 24:02.718
You came here for a reason. Don't you
want to ask me if I've got an offer?

24:03.730 --> 24:05.721
Have you got an offer? Not
yet, but I'll think of one.

24:06.733 --> 24:08.724
Oh, by the way,

24:09.736 --> 24:12.739
you're better at this
than I thought you'd be.

24:12.774 --> 24:15.731
I wasn't sure you'd noticed.

24:19.746 --> 24:23.715
Well, what shall we hang...
the holly or each other?

24:23.750 --> 24:28.755
Would you say, father, that I have
the makings of a king? A splendid king.

24:28.790 --> 24:30.757
And would you expect me, father,
to give up without a fight?

24:30.792 --> 24:33.725
Of course you'll fight.
I raised you to.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.763
I don't care what you offer Philip,
I don't care what plans you make.

24:36.798 --> 24:39.766
I'll have the Aquitaine
and Alais and the crown.

24:39.801 --> 24:41.733
I'll not give up one
to get the other.

24:41.768 --> 24:45.761
I won't trade off Alais or the
Aquitaine to that walking pustule!

24:47.774 --> 24:49.741
No, your loving son will not.

24:49.776 --> 24:52.744
Did you hear what he
called me? Clearly, dear.

24:52.779 --> 24:56.783
Now, run along. It's nearly dinnertime.
I only do what father tells me.

24:56.818 --> 24:59.751
Go and eat.
Did I say something wrong?

24:59.786 --> 25:01.686
I'm always saying something
wrong. And don't pout.

25:01.721 --> 25:03.712
I'm not pouting. And stand up straight!
How often do I have to tell you?

25:06.726 --> 25:11.720
And that's to be the king.
And I'm to be his chancellor.

25:12.165 --> 25:13.723
Has he told you?

25:14.600 --> 25:16.736
John will rule the country
while I run it, that is to say,

25:16.771 --> 25:18.703
he gets to spend
the taxes that I raise.

25:18.738 --> 25:22.731
How nice for you. It's
not as nice as being king.

25:23.376 --> 25:24.741
We've made you duke of
brittany. Is that so little?

25:25.478 --> 25:30.750
No one ever thinks of crown
and mentions Geoff. Why is that?

25:30.785 --> 25:32.717
Isn't being chancellor
power enough?

25:32.752 --> 25:35.755
It's not the power I feel deprived
of. It's the mention I miss.

25:35.790 --> 25:38.723
There's no affection
for me here.

25:38.758 --> 25:40.749
You wouldn't think
I'd want that, would you?

25:46.766 --> 25:49.734
Henry?
Hmm?

25:49.769 --> 25:51.760
I have a confession.
Yeah?

25:52.338 --> 25:56.741
- I don't much like
our children.

25:56.776 --> 26:01.714
Only you... the child I raised but
didn't bear. You never cared for me.

26:01.749 --> 26:04.706
I did and do, believe me.
Henry's bed is Henry's province.

26:05.718 --> 26:08.721
He can people it with sheep
for all I care,

26:08.756 --> 26:10.688
which, on occasion,
he has done.

26:10.723 --> 26:13.691
Rosamund's been dead
for seven years.

26:13.726 --> 26:17.526
Two months and 18 days.
I never liked her much.

26:17.730 --> 26:20.722
- You count the days?
- I made the numbers up.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.568
He found miss clifford
in the mists of wales...

26:23.736 --> 26:25.703
and brought her home
for closer observation.

26:25.738 --> 26:29.175
Liking what he found,
he scrutinized her many years.

26:29.210 --> 26:32.577
He loved her deeply, and
she, him. And yet, my dear,

26:32.612 --> 26:36.749
when Henry had to choose
between his lady and my lands...

26:36.784 --> 26:41.654
there is no sport in
hurting me. It's so easy.

26:41.689 --> 26:44.622
After all the years
of loving care,

26:44.657 --> 26:47.649
do you think I could
bring myself to hurt you?

26:47.760 --> 26:50.752
Eleanor, with both hands
tied behind you.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.761
She is lovely, isn't she?

27:03.676 --> 27:05.701
Yes, very.

27:06.712 --> 27:09.715
Who could I have chosen
to love...

27:09.750 --> 27:11.682
to gall you more?

27:11.717 --> 27:14.685
There's no one.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.687
Time hasn't done a thing
but wrinkle you.

27:16.722 --> 27:19.725
It hasn't even done that. I've
borne six girls, five boys...

27:19.760 --> 27:21.716
and 31 connubial years of you.

27:22.728 --> 27:26.231
How am I possible? There
are moments when I miss you.

27:26.266 --> 27:29.735
Many? That's my wooly
sheepdog. Do you doubt it?

27:29.770 --> 27:32.703
So, wee Johnny gets the crown.

27:32.738 --> 27:35.240
I've heard it rumored,
but I don't believe it.

27:35.275 --> 27:38.505
Losing Alais will be hard,
for you do love her.

27:38.540 --> 27:41.736
It's an old man's last
attachment, nothing more.

27:44.750 --> 27:48.719
How hard do you find
living in your castle?

27:48.754 --> 27:52.257
It was difficult in the
beginning, but that's past.

27:52.292 --> 27:55.761
I find I've seen
the world enough.

27:55.796 --> 27:57.752
I'll never let you loose.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.665
You led too many
civil wars against me.

28:00.700 --> 28:05.705
And I damn near won the last one.
Still, as long as I get trotted out...

28:05.740 --> 28:08.697
for Christmas courts and
state occasions now and then...

28:10.710 --> 28:13.713
for I do like to see you...

28:13.748 --> 28:15.704
it's enough.

28:18.718 --> 28:20.720
I'm famished.
Let's go in to dinner.

28:20.755 --> 28:23.712
Arm in arm.
And hand in hand.

28:25.725 --> 28:29.729
You're still
a marvel of a man.

28:29.764 --> 28:31.720
And you're my lady.

28:43.743 --> 28:45.710
It's an odd thing, Eleanor.

28:45.745 --> 28:48.713
I've fought and bargained
all these years...

28:48.748 --> 28:53.753
as if the only thing I had to live
for was what happened after I was dead.

28:53.788 --> 28:55.755
I've something else
to live for now.

28:55.790 --> 28:58.747
I've blundered onto peace.

28:59.759 --> 29:01.659
On Christmas eve.

29:01.694 --> 29:06.699
Since Louis died, while Philip
grew, I've had no France to fight.

29:06.734 --> 29:09.691
In that lull, I've found how
good it is to write a law...

29:10.703 --> 29:13.695
or make a tax more fair
or sit in judgment to decide...

29:14.707 --> 29:16.698
which peasant gets a cow.

29:17.710 --> 29:21.708
I tell you, there is nothing
more important in the world.

29:21.743 --> 29:25.707
Now the french boy's big enough,
and I'm sick of war.

29:30.723 --> 29:34.692
Do you still need
the vexin, Henry?

29:34.727 --> 29:37.730
It's as vital as it ever was. My troops
there are one day away from paris.

29:37.765 --> 29:40.733
That's a march of 20 miles.
I must keep it.

29:40.768 --> 29:43.701
Henry, dear,

29:43.736 --> 29:47.740
if Alais does not marry Richard,
I will see you lose the vexin.

29:47.775 --> 29:50.743
Well, I thought
you'd never say it.

29:50.778 --> 29:53.763
I can do it.

29:53.798 --> 29:56.714
You can try.

29:56.749 --> 30:00.753
We have a pack of barons we
should look the loving couple for.

30:00.788 --> 30:03.745
Can you read love in that?

30:04.757 --> 30:07.749
And permanent affection.

30:26.779 --> 30:30.748
My Richard is the next king,
not your John.

30:30.783 --> 30:33.786
I know you, Henry. I know
every twist and bend you've got,

30:33.821 --> 30:36.789
and I'll be waiting
round each corner for you.

30:36.824 --> 30:39.325
Do you truly care
who's king?

30:39.360 --> 30:41.792
I care because
you care so much.

30:41.827 --> 30:46.799
Don't fight me, Eleanor. What would you
have me do... give out, give up, give in?

30:46.834 --> 30:49.767
Give me a little peace.
A little?

30:49.802 --> 30:54.807
Why so modest? How about eternal
peace? Now, there's a thought.

30:54.842 --> 30:59.835
If you oppose me,
I'll strike you any way I can.

31:14.760 --> 31:17.728
Henry?
Madam?

31:17.763 --> 31:20.766
Did you ever love me?

31:20.801 --> 31:22.757
No.

31:23.769 --> 31:27.762
Good. That will
make this pleasanter.

32:40.179 --> 32:42.773
Well, I've come.
I'm here.

32:43.215 --> 32:47.184
What was it you wanted?
Just to talk.

32:47.219 --> 32:50.222
We haven't been alone,
the two of us, in...

32:50.257 --> 32:53.248
how long is it, lamb...
two years?

32:53.793 --> 32:55.760
You look fit.
War agrees with you.

32:55.795 --> 32:59.799
I keep informed. I follow all
your slaughters from a distance.

32:59.834 --> 33:01.699
Do sit down.

33:01.734 --> 33:05.226
Is this an audience, a good-night
hug with kisses or an ambush?

33:06.238 --> 33:08.490
Let's hope it's a reunion.

33:08.525 --> 33:10.708
Must you look so stern?

33:10.743 --> 33:13.279
I sent for you to say
I want your love again,

33:13.314 --> 33:15.713
but I can't say it
to a face like that.

33:15.748 --> 33:18.740
My love, of all things.
What would you want it for?

33:19.285 --> 33:22.755
Why, for itself. What
other purpose could I have?

33:22.790 --> 33:26.275
You will tell me
when you're ready to.

33:26.310 --> 33:29.761
I scheme a lot, I know.
I plot and plan.

33:30.329 --> 33:34.366
That's how a queen
in prison spends her time.

33:34.401 --> 33:36.734
But there is more to me
than that.

33:36.769 --> 33:40.364
Can't I say I love a son
and be believed?

33:43.409 --> 33:46.377
If I were you,
I'd try another tack.

33:46.412 --> 33:50.416
I've no dammed up floods of passion for
you. There's no chance I'll overflow.

33:50.451 --> 33:54.785
You're a dull boy, dull as plainsong.
La-la-la, forever on one note.

33:55.020 --> 33:59.458
I gave the church up out of
boredom. I can do as much for you.

33:59.493 --> 34:02.693
You'll never give me up,
not while I hold the Aquitaine.

34:02.728 --> 34:07.722
You think I'm motivated by love of hills
and dales? I think you want it back.

34:08.434 --> 34:11.737
You're so deceitful, you can't
ask for water when you're thirsty.

34:11.772 --> 34:15.741
We could tangle spiders
in the webs you weave.

34:15.775 --> 34:18.639
If I'm so devious,
why don't you go?

34:18.674 --> 34:21.503
Don't stand there
qulvering in limbo.

34:21.746 --> 34:25.513
Love me, little lamb,
or leave me.

34:26.752 --> 34:29.149
Leave you, madam?

34:29.184 --> 34:31.545
With pure joy.

34:33.759 --> 34:38.563
Departure's a simple act. You put the
left foot down, and then the right.

34:38.599 --> 34:40.554
Mother! Hush, dear. Mother's fighting.

34:40.766 --> 34:44.603
Father's finished working out
the treaty terms.

34:44.638 --> 34:48.596
How nice.
Where is your father?

34:51.777 --> 34:53.744
Ah, there you are.

34:53.779 --> 34:55.746
Well, have you
put the terms to Philip?

34:55.781 --> 34:59.774
Not yet, but we're shortly granting him
an audience. I hope you'll all attend.

35:01.720 --> 35:04.688
Are we to know the terms,
or would you rather tease us?

35:04.723 --> 35:08.226
Not at all. The terms are... what are
you giving to Philip, what of mine?

35:08.261 --> 35:11.730
Whatever you've got goes to me. And
what's the nothing Geoffrey gets?

35:11.765 --> 35:14.750
My God, boys,
you can't all three be king.

35:14.785 --> 35:17.736
All three of us can try.
That's pointless now.

35:17.771 --> 35:20.704
I want you to succeed me,
Richard.

35:20.739 --> 35:23.731
Alais and the crown...
I give you both.

35:24.743 --> 35:26.745
I've no sense of humor.
If I did, I'd laugh.

35:26.780 --> 35:30.714
- I mean to do it.
- What about me?

35:30.749 --> 35:32.745
I'm your favorite.
I'm the one you love.

35:32.780 --> 35:34.742
I'm sorry, John.
I can't help myself.

35:35.020 --> 35:38.757
Could you keep anything I gave you?
Could you beat him in the field?

35:38.792 --> 35:40.748
You could.
John, I won't be there.

35:40.926 --> 35:44.763
I'm losing too.
All my dreams for you are lost.

35:44.798 --> 35:46.730
You've led me on.
I never meant to.

35:46.765 --> 35:49.768
You're a failure as a father.
You know that? I'm sorry, Johnny.

35:49.803 --> 35:52.771
Not yet, but I'll do something
terrible, and you'll be sorry then.

35:52.806 --> 35:57.776
Did you rehearse all this,
or are you improvising?

35:57.811 --> 35:59.761
Good God, woman,
face the facts.

35:59.796 --> 36:01.712
Which ones?
We have so many.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.682
Power is the only fact.

36:04.717 --> 36:07.685
How could I keep him
from the throne?

36:07.720 --> 36:09.722
He'd only take it
if I didn't give it to him.

36:09.757 --> 36:11.689
No, you'd make me
fight for it.

36:11.724 --> 36:14.727
I know you. You'd never give me
anything. True, and I haven't.

36:14.762 --> 36:17.730
You get Alais and the kingdom,
but I get the thing I want most:

36:17.765 --> 36:20.722
If you're king, England
stays intact. I get that.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.737
It's all yours now... the crown,
the girl, the whole black business.

36:24.772 --> 36:26.728
Isn't that enough?

36:28.741 --> 36:31.709
I don't know
who's to be congratulated.

36:31.744 --> 36:35.748
Kings, Queens, knights everywhere
you look, and I'm the only pawn.

36:35.783 --> 36:40.742
I haven't got a thing to lose.
That makes me dangerous.

36:42.755 --> 36:44.722
- Poor child.
- Poor John.

36:44.757 --> 36:49.727
Who says, "poor John"?
Don't everybody sob at once.

36:49.762 --> 36:51.753
My God, if I went up in flames,
there's not a living soul...

36:52.765 --> 36:54.767
who'd pee on me
to put the fire out.

36:54.802 --> 36:58.736
Let's strike a flint and see.

36:58.771 --> 37:02.235
You're everything a little
brother dreams of, you know that?

37:02.270 --> 37:05.700
- I used to dream about you all the time.
- Ah, Johnny.

37:06.712 --> 37:10.705
I'll show you, Eleanor.
I've not lost yet.

37:16.722 --> 37:20.715
Well, mummy,
if you want me, here I am.

37:22.728 --> 37:27.733
John's lost his chancellor,
has he? And you've gained one.

37:27.768 --> 37:31.702
It's a bitter thing
your mummy has to say.

37:31.737 --> 37:35.741
She doesn't trust me. You must
know Henry isn't through with John.

37:35.776 --> 37:39.710
He'll keep the vexin till
the moon goes blue from cold.

37:39.745 --> 37:43.749
And as for Richard's wedding day...
we'll see the second coming first.

37:43.784 --> 37:46.752
The needlework alone can
last for years.

37:46.787 --> 37:48.719
I know.

37:48.754 --> 37:50.721
You know I know.

37:50.756 --> 37:53.724
I know you know I know.

37:53.759 --> 37:58.764
We know Henry knows,
and Henry knows we know it.

37:58.799 --> 38:00.664
We're a knowledgeable family.

38:00.699 --> 38:03.691
Will Richard take me
for his chancellor or won't he?

38:05.704 --> 38:07.671
Why are you dropping John?

38:07.706 --> 38:12.711
Because you're going to win. You will,
with me to help you. I haven't yet.

38:12.746 --> 38:15.679
I can handle John. He'll
swallow anything I tell him.

38:15.714 --> 38:18.717
I'll take him by the hand and
walk him into the trap you set.

38:18.752 --> 38:20.684
You're good.
You're first class, Geoff.

38:20.719 --> 38:23.687
You'd sell John out to me,
or me to John, or...

38:23.722 --> 38:28.727
you can tell me... have you found some
way of selling everyone to everybody?

38:28.762 --> 38:30.752
Not yet, mummy,
but I'm working on it.

38:31.730 --> 38:35.699
I don't care who's king,
but you and Henry do.

38:35.734 --> 38:38.760
I want to watch the two of you
go picnicking on one another.

38:39.805 --> 38:42.706
You have a gift for hating.

38:42.741 --> 38:45.733
You're the expert.
You should know.

38:45.811 --> 38:48.712
Dear lord.

38:48.747 --> 38:51.715
You've loved me
all these years.

38:51.750 --> 38:56.855
Oh, God forgive me. I've upset
the queen. We need you. Help us.

38:56.890 --> 38:58.857
What... and miss the fun
of selling you?

38:58.892 --> 39:01.690
Be Richard's chancellor.

39:04.696 --> 39:06.687
Rot.

39:12.704 --> 39:15.696
Well, that's how
deals are made.

39:16.708 --> 39:19.307
We've got him
if we want him.

39:19.342 --> 39:21.906
He'll sell us all,
you know,

39:22.714 --> 39:24.909
but only if he thinks
we think he won't.

39:26.718 --> 39:30.722
Why did I have to have
such clever children?

39:36.728 --> 39:39.731
What's the matter, Richard? Nothing.

39:39.766 --> 39:42.699
It's a heavy thing,
your nothing.

39:42.734 --> 39:45.737
When I write or send for you
or speak or reach,

39:45.772 --> 39:49.741
your nothings come,
like stones.

39:49.776 --> 39:52.009
Don't play a scene with me.

39:52.044 --> 39:55.741
I wouldn't if I could.
I'm simpler than I used to be.

39:56.048 --> 39:57.743
I had, at one time,
many appetites.

39:58.050 --> 40:01.747
I wanted poetry and power and the
young men who create them both.

40:02.087 --> 40:05.079
I even wanted Henry, too,
in those days.

40:05.757 --> 40:09.726
Now I've only one desire left...
to see you king.

40:09.761 --> 40:12.764
The only thing you want to see is
father's vitals on a bed of lettuce.

40:12.799 --> 40:15.767
You don't care who wins, as long
as Henry loses. You'd do anything.

40:15.802 --> 40:17.734
You are Medea to the teeth,

40:17.769 --> 40:21.762
only this is one son you won't use
for vengeance against your husband.

40:23.775 --> 40:25.766
How my captivity has
changed you.

40:27.179 --> 40:31.775
Henry meant to hurt me.
He's hacked you up instead.

40:34.219 --> 40:37.211
Men coveted this talon once.

40:37.789 --> 40:41.225
Henry was 18 when we met,
and I was queen of France.

40:41.260 --> 40:44.796
He came down from the north to
Paris with a mind like Aristotle's...

40:44.831 --> 40:48.765
and a form like mortal sin.

40:48.800 --> 40:52.269
We shattered the commandments
on the spot.

40:52.304 --> 40:56.308
I spent three months annulling
Louis, then in may, in spring,

40:56.343 --> 40:59.044
not far from here,
we married...

40:59.079 --> 41:01.745
young count Henry
and his countess.

41:02.281 --> 41:07.753
But in three years' time I was his
queen, and he was king of England.

41:07.788 --> 41:13.724
Done at 21... five years
your junior, general.

41:13.759 --> 41:18.764
I can count. There was no Thomas
Beckett then, or Rosamund...

41:18.799 --> 41:22.332
no rivals, only me.

41:22.367 --> 41:26.571
And then young Henry came,
and you...

41:26.606 --> 41:30.741
and all the other blossoms
in my garden.

41:30.776 --> 41:35.781
Yes. Had I been sterile,
darling, I'd be happier today.

41:35.816 --> 41:38.409
Is that designed to hurt me?
What a waste.

41:38.784 --> 41:41.446
I've fought with Henry over who
comes next, whose dawn it is...

41:41.787 --> 41:44.779
and which son gets the sunset,
and we'll never live to see it.

41:46.458 --> 41:48.449
Look at you.

41:48.794 --> 41:51.762
I loved you more than Henry,

41:51.797 --> 41:54.493
and it's cost me everything.
What do you want?

41:55.801 --> 41:59.805
I want us back the way we
were. No, that's not it.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.740
All right, then.
I want the Aquitaine.

42:03.475 --> 42:07.711
That's the mother I remember.
We can win. I can get you Alais.

42:07.746 --> 42:11.516
I can make the marriage happen, but
I've got to have the Aquitaine to do it.

42:11.551 --> 42:14.417
I must have it back. It's
mine, and I'll never give it up.

42:14.686 --> 42:18.488
Shall I write my will,
"to Richard... everything"?

42:18.523 --> 42:22.550
Would you believe me then?
Where's paper? Paper burns.

42:24.763 --> 42:26.730
I love you.

42:26.765 --> 42:29.433
You love nothing.

42:29.468 --> 42:33.461
You're incomplete. The human
parts of you are missing.

42:33.772 --> 42:37.509
You're as dead
as you are deadly.

42:37.544 --> 42:39.773
Don't leave me.

42:43.515 --> 42:45.645
You were lovely once.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.775
I've seen the pictures.

42:48.553 --> 42:51.386
Don't you remember
how you loved me?

42:51.656 --> 42:54.758
We were always hand in hand.

42:54.793 --> 42:59.161
Here's how it felt.
As hot and coarse as that?

42:59.196 --> 43:03.530
This won't burn.
I'll scratch a will on this.

43:03.735 --> 43:05.737
"To Richard... everything."

43:05.772 --> 43:07.728
Mother!

43:10.742 --> 43:13.578
Remember how I
taught you numbers...

43:13.613 --> 43:16.615
and the lute and poetry?

43:16.650 --> 43:19.583
See? You do remember.

43:19.618 --> 43:22.719
I taught you dancing, too,
and languages...

43:22.754 --> 43:26.747
and all the music I knew and
how to love what's beautiful.

43:27.659 --> 43:32.756
The sun was warmer then,
and we were every day together.

44:00.725 --> 44:05.730
William, tell the french king
I'll see him in the parlor.

44:05.765 --> 44:07.721
Yes, my lord.
In half an hour.

44:08.733 --> 44:10.724
Half an hour. Good.

44:16.741 --> 44:20.734
Of course, you know there's not
a word of truth to Henry's terms.

44:21.746 --> 44:23.748
If that's a warning,
thank you.

44:23.783 --> 44:26.740
What if it's an offer?

44:27.752 --> 44:30.249
"What if" is
a game for scholars.

44:30.284 --> 44:32.746
What if angels
sat on pinheads?

44:35.760 --> 44:38.257
What if I were king?

44:38.292 --> 44:40.754
It's your game, Geoff.

44:41.766 --> 44:43.757
You play it.

44:58.783 --> 45:00.717
John.

45:03.722 --> 45:06.690
I made this for father.
All the pieces work.

45:06.725 --> 45:09.728
It took months. I'm not a fool.
I know. Now, here's my plan.

45:09.763 --> 45:13.732
I read three languages.
I've studied law.

45:13.767 --> 45:15.699
What plan?

45:15.734 --> 45:17.725
We've got to make a
deal with Philip. Why?

45:18.737 --> 45:21.705
Because you're out, and Richard's
in. And what kind of deal?

45:21.740 --> 45:26.745
A war. If we three join and fight
now, we can finish Richard off.

45:26.780 --> 45:29.737
You mean destroy him?
Hmm.

45:30.749 --> 45:32.751
And mother too?

45:32.786 --> 45:34.718
And mother too.

45:34.753 --> 45:38.256
Now, do we do it? Is it
on? I've got to think.

45:38.291 --> 45:41.760
You haven't time.
We are extra princes now.

45:41.795 --> 45:43.751
You know where
extra princes go?

45:46.765 --> 45:48.756
Down.

45:49.768 --> 45:53.761
Well, does John want a war
or doesn't he?

45:54.773 --> 45:57.776
Do you? If John asks for your
soldiers, will he get them?

45:57.811 --> 46:00.677
If John wants a war,
he's got one.

46:00.712 --> 46:03.680
John, you hear that?
I'm still thinking.

46:03.715 --> 46:07.708
Let me help. It's either
Richard on the throne or you.

46:09.721 --> 46:12.713
Do you think we'd win?

46:14.726 --> 46:16.717
I know it.

46:30.742 --> 46:33.734
Henry!

46:34.412 --> 46:39.083
But you don't understand. I would
appreciate a little qulet confidence.

46:39.118 --> 46:43.755
I've enough nits picking at me.
But you've promised me to Richard!

46:43.790 --> 46:46.723
Good God,
you don't think I meant it?

46:46.758 --> 46:49.726
So that whole scene,
all you said to John...

46:49.761 --> 46:53.765
you think I'd ever give him up when I've
mothered him and fathered him and babied him?

46:53.800 --> 46:57.769
He's all I've got! How often do you
people have to hear it... every supper?

46:57.804 --> 46:59.771
Should we start the soup with
who we love and who we don't?

46:59.806 --> 47:01.705
I think you like passing me
from hand to hand.

47:02.707 --> 47:04.709
What am I to you...
a collection plate?

47:04.744 --> 47:06.676
Or am I all you've got,
like John?

47:06.711 --> 47:09.679
I've got to get
the Aquitaine for John.

47:09.714 --> 47:14.684
- I talk people, and you answer back in provinces!
- They get mixed up.

47:14.719 --> 47:16.710
What's the Aquitaine to Eleanor? It's
not a province. It's a way to torture me.

47:17.722 --> 47:21.225
That's why she spent the evening
wooing Richard, wheezing on the coals.

47:21.260 --> 47:24.729
She'll squeeze it out of him. My
God, I'd have loved to eavesdrop.

47:24.764 --> 47:28.756
"I taught you prancing, lamb,
and lute and flute..."

47:29.734 --> 47:32.760
That's marvelous.

47:33.738 --> 47:34.796
It's absolutely me.

47:35.740 --> 47:38.743
I thought as long as I was
coming down, I'd bring them.

47:38.778 --> 47:40.777
Whatever are you giving me?

47:40.812 --> 47:42.803
You're such a child.
You always ask.

47:43.748 --> 47:45.750
"To Henry."

47:45.785 --> 47:47.717
Heavy.

47:47.752 --> 47:50.755
It's my tombstone!
Eleanor, you spoil me.

47:50.790 --> 47:52.746
I never could
deny you anything.

47:52.857 --> 47:57.344
Don't go. It nettles her
to see how much I need you.

47:57.379 --> 48:01.832
You need me, Henry, like a
tailor needs a tinker's dam.

48:02.834 --> 48:05.669
Oh, I know that look.

48:05.704 --> 48:07.706
He's going to say
he loves me.

48:07.741 --> 48:09.867
Like my life.

48:14.713 --> 48:17.681
I talk that way
to keep her spirits up.

48:17.716 --> 48:21.720
Well, how'd you do with
Richard? Did you break his heart?

48:21.755 --> 48:24.688
You think he ought to
give me back the Aquitaine?

48:24.723 --> 48:27.954
I can't see why he shouldn't. After
all, I've promised him the throne.

48:28.727 --> 48:32.929
The boy keeps wondering
if your promises are any good.

48:32.964 --> 48:37.001
There's no sense asking if the air's
good when there's nothing else to breathe.

48:37.036 --> 48:39.731
Exactly what I told him.

48:40.004 --> 48:44.743
Have you got it?
Will he give it back?

48:44.778 --> 48:47.735
No Aquitaine for John.

48:54.052 --> 48:58.722
I have to give him something.
Isn't some agreement possible?

48:58.757 --> 49:03.027
Love, in a world where carpenters
get resurrected, anything is possible.

49:03.062 --> 49:06.381
You bore him, damn it.
He's your son!

49:06.416 --> 49:09.701
Oh, heavens, yes.
280 days I bore him.

49:09.736 --> 49:12.035
I recall them all.

49:12.070 --> 49:14.671
You'd only just found Rosamund.

49:14.706 --> 49:18.699
Why her so damn particularly?
I've found other women.

49:20.111 --> 49:22.102
Countless others.

49:22.714 --> 49:24.113
What's your count?

49:24.716 --> 49:28.152
Let's have a tally of the
bedspreads you've spread out on.

49:30.722 --> 49:33.714
Thomas Beckett's.
That's a lie.

49:34.726 --> 49:40.163
I know.
You still care what I do.

49:40.198 --> 49:43.201
I want the Aquitaine for John!
I want it, and I'll have it.

49:43.236 --> 49:46.227
Is that menace you're
conveying? Is it to be torture?

49:46.738 --> 49:50.742
Will you boil me or stretch me...
which? Or am I to be perforated?

49:50.777 --> 49:53.209
I have the documents,
and you will sign.

49:53.244 --> 49:57.282
How will you force me to... threats?
"Sign or I refuse to feed you."

49:57.317 --> 50:02.719
Tears? "Oh, sign before
my heart goes crack."

50:02.754 --> 50:06.747
I'm like the earth, old man...
there isn't any way around me.

50:07.325 --> 50:08.758
I adore you.

50:09.327 --> 50:12.319
Save your aching arches.
That road's closed.

50:13.765 --> 50:15.767
I have an offer for you,
my dear.

50:15.802 --> 50:18.334
A deal? A deal?

50:18.369 --> 50:23.363
I give the richest province on
the continent to John for what?

50:23.775 --> 50:27.404
You tell me,
mastermind, for what.

50:30.782 --> 50:32.773
Your freedom.

50:39.457 --> 50:41.789
Oh.

50:42.460 --> 50:44.792
Once Johnny gets the Aquitaine,
you're free. I'll let you out.

50:44.929 --> 50:48.765
Think: On the loose in london,
winters in provence,

50:48.800 --> 50:51.792
impromptu trips to visit Richard
anywhere he's killing people...

50:52.804 --> 50:56.773
all that for a signature.

50:56.808 --> 51:01.746
- You're good.
- I thought it might appeal. You always fancied traveling.

51:01.781 --> 51:03.713
Yes.

51:03.748 --> 51:07.752
I even made poor Louis
take me on crusade.

51:07.787 --> 51:10.486
How's that for blasphemy?

51:10.521 --> 51:15.760
I dressed my maids as amazons and
rode bare-breasted halfway to damascus.

51:15.795 --> 51:18.752
Louls had a seizure, and I
damn near died of windburn,

51:23.768 --> 51:26.601
but the troops were dazzled.

51:31.609 --> 51:33.770
Henry, I'm against the wall.

51:36.648 --> 51:38.639
To be a prisoner...

51:39.651 --> 51:41.778
to be bricked in...

51:42.787 --> 51:44.778
when you've known the world...

51:47.692 --> 51:50.786
I'll never know how I survived.

51:52.697 --> 51:57.725
These ten years, Henry,
have been unimaginable.

51:59.804 --> 52:01.738
And now,

52:04.676 --> 52:07.745
you offer me
the only thing I want...

52:07.780 --> 52:10.680
if I give up...

52:10.715 --> 52:12.740
the only thing I treasure.

52:14.719 --> 52:17.720
Sign the paper, and we'll
break the happy news.

52:17.755 --> 52:21.759
The queen is free, John gets the
Aquitaine, and Richard marries Alais.

52:21.794 --> 52:25.763
Yes, let's have it done.

52:25.798 --> 52:27.754
I'll sign.

52:29.767 --> 52:32.735
On one condition.
Name it.

52:32.770 --> 52:36.739
Have the wedding now.
What's that?

52:36.774 --> 52:40.743
Why, I've surprised you.
Surely it's not sudden.

52:40.778 --> 52:44.782
They've been marching down the aisle
for 16 years, and that's a long walk.

52:44.817 --> 52:48.751
John can be best man.
That's a laugh.

52:48.786 --> 52:52.790
And you can give the bride
away. I want to watch you do it.

52:52.825 --> 52:57.760
Alais...
I can live without her.

52:57.795 --> 52:59.762
And I thought you loved her. So I do.

52:59.797 --> 53:03.735
Thank God. You frightened me.
I was afraid this wouldn't hurt.

53:03.770 --> 53:06.727
What a tragedy you are.

53:08.740 --> 53:13.734
I wonder...
do you ever wonder...

53:14.746 --> 53:17.738
if I slept
with your father?

53:21.753 --> 53:25.251
My father?
It's a lie.

53:25.286 --> 53:28.749
But there are rumors.

53:29.761 --> 53:31.728
Don't you ever wonder?

53:31.763 --> 53:34.755
Is it rich, despising
me? Is it rewarding? No.

53:35.299 --> 53:37.734
Then stop!
How?

53:37.769 --> 53:39.760
It's what I live for.
I'll show you.

53:40.571 --> 53:42.739
By christ, I will.
I'll do it.

53:42.774 --> 53:46.505
Where's a priest?
Somebody dig me up a priest!

53:47.779 --> 53:50.747
You!
Fetch me a bishop!

53:50.782 --> 53:53.750
Get old Durham.
He's just down the hall.

53:53.785 --> 53:57.778
Ask him to meet us in the
chapel. John, Richard, Geoffrey!

54:30.755 --> 54:33.758
What's wrong? What's happened?
Richard's getting married.

54:33.793 --> 54:38.728
Getting married? Now?
He's getting married now?

54:38.763 --> 54:40.765
I never cease to marvel at
the qulckness of your mind.

54:40.800 --> 54:43.733
You can't hurt me,
you bag of bile.

54:43.768 --> 54:45.735
But you can, father.
Why? Because I say so.

54:45.770 --> 54:49.774
My lord, the bishop's waiting in the
chapel. Good. Let's get this over with.

54:49.809 --> 54:52.742
You'll make a lovely bride.
I wonder if I'll cry.

54:52.777 --> 54:55.745
You sound as if you think
it's going to happen. I do.

54:55.780 --> 54:57.771
He's only plotting. Can't you
tell when Henry's plotting?

54:58.783 --> 55:00.751
Not this time.
He'll never give me up.

55:00.786 --> 55:02.685
You think I won't?
Because you told me so.

55:02.720 --> 55:05.723
You're not my helen. I won't fight
a war to save a face. We're done.

55:05.758 --> 55:08.715
I don't believe you!
Wait ten minutes!

55:11.729 --> 55:15.733
Please! Richard, Richard,
we're not...

55:15.768 --> 55:17.735
honestly, we're not!

55:20.738 --> 55:23.730
Please!
We love each other.

55:26.744 --> 55:31.738
Come on! It's lunacy!
I won't do it! I won't!

55:32.750 --> 55:36.743
- Lunacy! Let me go, Henry. Richard, no!
- Come on!

55:37.555 --> 55:39.757
I won't say the words!
Not one of them!

55:39.792 --> 55:42.777
It makes no sense!
Why give me up?

55:42.812 --> 55:45.763
What do you get?
What are you gaining?

55:45.798 --> 55:48.799
Why, the Aquitaine,
of course.

55:48.834 --> 55:50.766
What's that again?

55:50.801 --> 55:53.771
Your mother gets her freedom,
and I get the Aquitaine.

55:53.806 --> 55:55.771
That is the proposition,
isn't it? You did agree.

55:55.806 --> 55:58.832
Of course she did. I knew it. It
was all pretense. I believed it all.

55:59.510 --> 56:02.713
I meant it all. No wedding.
There'll be no wedding.

56:02.748 --> 56:05.681
But, my boy, look.
Durham's waiting.

56:05.716 --> 56:08.769
Marry her, for my sake. It
isn't much to ask. Never!

56:08.804 --> 56:11.787
But I promised it to Philip.
Think of my position.

56:11.822 --> 56:14.814
Damn the wedding and to hell with
your position. You don't dare defy me.

56:15.726 --> 56:17.717
Don't I?

56:17.862 --> 56:21.732
You're the king of France, for
God's sake. Speak up. Do something.

56:21.767 --> 56:23.859
Make a threat. Come on,
frighten me. Am I? Dunce!

56:24.435 --> 56:27.703
He never meant
to have the wedding.

56:27.738 --> 56:31.742
Come again. You're good at
rage. I like the way you play it.

56:31.777 --> 56:34.734
Boy, don't ever call a king
a liar to his face.

56:34.912 --> 56:38.915
I'm not a boy...
to you or anyone!

56:38.950 --> 56:41.748
Boy, you came here asking
for a wedding or the vexin back.

56:41.953 --> 56:45.946
By God, you don't get either. It's no
to both. You have a pact with France!

56:46.357 --> 56:49.760
Then damn the pact and damn France.
She never marries, not while I'm alive.

56:49.795 --> 56:52.728
Your life and never
are two different times.

56:52.763 --> 56:57.733
Not on my clock, boy!
Listen to the lion!

56:57.768 --> 57:01.706
Come on, frighten me. Don't spoil it,
Richard. Take it like a good sport.

57:01.741 --> 57:03.673
How's your bad leg?
Better, thank you.

57:03.708 --> 57:06.978
Your bad back? You're getting
old. You'll have me once too often.

57:07.013 --> 57:10.715
When? I'm 50 now. My God,
boy, I'm the oldest man I know.

57:10.750 --> 57:12.706
I've got a decade
on the pope.

57:16.020 --> 57:19.021
What's it to be? The
broadsword when I'm 85?

57:19.056 --> 57:22.727
I'm not a second son now. Your
Henry's lies in the vault, you know.

57:22.762 --> 57:26.696
I know.
I've seen him there.

57:26.731 --> 57:29.100
I'll have the crown. You'll
have what daddy gives you.

57:29.135 --> 57:32.702
I am next in line!
To nothing!

57:32.737 --> 57:34.739
Then we'll only have the
broadswords now. This minute?

57:34.774 --> 57:36.706
No, on the battlefield!
So we're at war?

57:36.741 --> 57:39.442
Yes, we're at war. I have 2,000
men at poitiers. Can they hear you?

57:39.477 --> 57:42.144
Call and see who answers. You're
as close to poitiers as you'll get.

57:42.747 --> 57:47.251
You don't dare hold me prisoner. Until we're
all agreed John comes next, I can and will.

57:47.286 --> 57:51.756
You're a king's son, so I treat you with
respect. You have the freedom of the castle.

57:51.791 --> 57:54.190
The castle doesn't stand that
holds me. Post your guards.

57:56.193 --> 57:59.754
My God, I'm king again.
Fantastic.

57:59.997 --> 58:03.694
Are you happy for me, Geoff?
I'm happy for us both.

58:16.514 --> 58:19.244
You played it nicely.
You were good.

58:19.717 --> 58:24.505
Yes, I was.
I fooled you, didn't I?

58:24.540 --> 58:29.293
Oh, God, but I do love
being king.

58:29.328 --> 58:31.284
Well, Henry,

58:31.729 --> 58:34.509
liege and lord,

58:34.544 --> 58:37.290
what happens now?

58:37.735 --> 58:39.327
I've no idea.

58:39.737 --> 58:43.730
I know I'm winning, and I know I'll
win, but what the next move is...

58:48.379 --> 58:50.745
you were scared,
weren't you?

58:52.383 --> 58:54.749
No.

58:57.388 --> 58:58.753
I think you were.

58:59.423 --> 59:04.360
I was. You mustn't play with
feelings, Henry. Not with mine.

59:05.696 --> 59:09.365
It wasn't possible
to lose you.

59:09.400 --> 59:11.698
I must hold you dearer
than I thought.

59:14.705 --> 59:19.699
You've got your enigmatic face
on. What's your mood, I wonder?

59:21.445 --> 59:23.679
Pure delight.

59:23.714 --> 59:27.707
I'm locked up
with my sons.

59:28.486 --> 59:31.478
What mother does not
dream of that?

59:38.529 --> 59:40.724
One thing.
Yes?

59:41.732 --> 59:44.530
May I watch you kiss her?

59:44.735 --> 59:47.653
Can't you ever stop?

59:47.688 --> 59:50.571
I watch you every night.

59:50.741 --> 59:53.733
I conjure it
before I sleep.

59:54.578 --> 59:56.712
Leave it there.

59:56.747 --> 01:00:00.178
My curiosity
is intellectual.

01:00:00.213 --> 01:00:03.610
I want to see
how accurate I am.

01:00:07.758 --> 01:00:11.660
Forget the dragon
in the doorway. Come.

01:00:14.765 --> 01:00:17.666
Believe I love you,
for I do.

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:21.694
Believe I'm yours forever,
for I am.

01:00:22.773 --> 01:00:27.710
Believe in my contentment
and the joy you give me.

01:00:28.779 --> 01:00:30.770
And believe...

01:00:35.753 --> 01:00:37.778
you want more?

01:00:43.794 --> 01:00:47.787
I'm an old man
in an empty place.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.791
Be with me.

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:47.780
How beautiful you make me.

01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:56.790
What might solomon have sung
had he seen this.

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:00.703
I can't.

01:02:00.738 --> 01:02:02.729
I'd turn to salt.

01:02:05.743 --> 01:02:07.734
I've lost again.

01:02:09.747 --> 01:02:12.739
I'm done for this time.

01:02:14.752 --> 01:02:20.748
Well, there'll be
other Christmases.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.753
I'd hang you from the nipples,
but you'd shock the children.

01:02:34.271 --> 01:02:37.263
They kissed sweetly,
didn't they?

01:02:39.815 --> 01:02:43.819
I'll have him next time.
I can wait.

01:02:43.854 --> 01:02:46.811
Ah, there you are!

01:02:47.823 --> 01:02:52.817
My comfort
and my company.

01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:57.822
We're locked in
for another year.

01:03:00.769 --> 01:03:02.760
Four seasons more.

01:03:05.774 --> 01:03:07.765
What a desolation.

01:03:10.779 --> 01:03:13.771
What a life's work.

01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:22.756
Is it too much?

01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:25.794
Be sure to squlnt
as you approach.

01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:28.797
You may be blinded
by my beauty.

01:03:28.832 --> 01:03:31.765
Merry Christmas.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.803
Is that why you're here...
to tell me that?

01:03:34.838 --> 01:03:37.806
I thought
you might be lonely.

01:03:37.841 --> 01:03:40.320
Here, chancellor.

01:03:40.355 --> 01:03:42.800
Try it on for size.

01:03:43.812 --> 01:03:45.779
It's puzzling.

01:03:45.814 --> 01:03:48.782
I remember my third birthday.

01:03:48.817 --> 01:03:51.814
Not just pictures
of the garden or the gifts,

01:03:51.849 --> 01:03:54.812
but who did what to whom
and how it felt.

01:03:55.824 --> 01:03:57.826
My memory stretches that far back,
but never once can I remember...

01:03:57.861 --> 01:04:00.762
anything from you or father
warmer than indifference.

01:04:00.797 --> 01:04:02.753
Why is that?

01:04:04.766 --> 01:04:07.734
I don't know.

01:04:07.769 --> 01:04:11.796
That was not an easy question from me,
and I don't deserve and easy answer.

01:04:13.775 --> 01:04:18.847
There are times I think we
loved none of our children.

01:04:18.882 --> 01:04:21.815
Still too easy,
don't you think?

01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:25.787
I'm weary, and you want
a simple answer,

01:04:25.822 --> 01:04:27.821
and I haven't one.

01:04:27.856 --> 01:04:31.792
I'm so sick
of all of you.

01:04:31.893 --> 01:04:34.761
I thought I'd come
and gloat a little.

01:04:34.796 --> 01:04:37.799
Mother's tired. Come stick
pins tomorrow morning.

01:04:37.834 --> 01:04:39.766
I'll be
more responsive then.

01:04:39.801 --> 01:04:42.929
It's no fun goading anyone
tonight. Bastard's boxed us up.

01:04:43.805 --> 01:04:46.942
What's that, dear? We're his
prisoners, if that interests you.

01:04:46.977 --> 01:04:49.809
Why should it?
I'm his prisoner anyway?

01:04:49.978 --> 01:04:51.945
It was... correct me
if I'm wrong...

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:54.972
but it was my impression that
you wanted Henry's throne for me.

01:04:55.817 --> 01:04:59.020
We can't win, Richard.
We've lost it this time.

01:04:59.055 --> 01:05:01.722
You think I'm finished, do you? So I do.

01:05:01.757 --> 01:05:03.952
I've suffered more defeats
than you have teeth.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.727
I know one
when it happens to me.

01:05:06.762 --> 01:05:09.993
Take your wormwood like a good
boy. Swallow it and go to bed.

01:05:10.766 --> 01:05:13.001
I will be king. So you
will, but not this year!

01:05:13.036 --> 01:05:16.994
Oh, leave it, Richard!
Let it go for now.

01:05:17.773 --> 01:05:19.740
I can't.
It's not so hard.

01:05:19.775 --> 01:05:23.040
Try saying after me:
John wins, I lose.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.747
And what if John died?

01:05:26.782 --> 01:05:29.080
You wouldn't dare! A
knife. Why wouldn't I?

01:05:29.785 --> 01:05:31.787
He's got a knife! Of course he
has a knife. He always has a knife.

01:05:31.822 --> 01:05:35.055
We all have knives. It's
1183, and we're barbarians.

01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:40.761
How clear we make it. Oh, my
piglets, we are the origins of war.

01:05:40.796 --> 01:05:44.132
Not history's forces, nor the times,
nor justice, nor the lack of it,

01:05:44.167 --> 01:05:47.100
nor causes, nor religions,
nor ideas,

01:05:47.135 --> 01:05:50.002
nor kinds of government,
nor any other thing.

01:05:50.272 --> 01:05:53.225
Weare the killers.
Webreed wars.

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:56.143
We carry it,
like syphilis, inside.

01:05:56.178 --> 01:05:59.815
Dead bodies rot in field and stream
because the living ones are rotten.

01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:02.750
For the love of God, can't we
love one another just a little?

01:06:03.151 --> 01:06:05.745
That's how peace begins.

01:06:06.755 --> 01:06:09.969
We have so much
to love each other for.

01:06:10.004 --> 01:06:13.184
We have such possibilities,
my children.

01:06:13.762 --> 01:06:15.195
We could change the world.

01:06:15.764 --> 01:06:18.198
And while we hugged each other,
what would Philip do?

01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:21.235
Oh, good God, Philip!

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:24.773
We're supposed to start a war. If
father finds out, I'll be rulned.

01:06:24.808 --> 01:06:28.072
Steady, John. Don't panic.
Some adviser you are.

01:06:28.376 --> 01:06:31.277
Don't do anything without me. Let me
handle it. He's made a pact with Philip.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.782
You advised John into making
war. That fearless boy...

01:06:33.817 --> 01:06:35.749
he's disinherited himself.

01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:38.752
When Henry finds out... when
I tell him what John's done...

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:42.057
I need a little time. Can you keep
John from Philip till I say so?

01:06:42.092 --> 01:06:45.327
Anything you say. Richard, I want
you out of here before this breaks.

01:06:45.362 --> 01:06:47.329
And that means Philip.
Go to him, be desperate.

01:06:47.364 --> 01:06:49.329
Promise anything...
the vexin, brittany.

01:06:49.364 --> 01:06:53.084
Once you're free and John is out
of favor, we'll make further plans.

01:06:53.119 --> 01:06:56.805
You see Philip. You're the diplomat.
You see him, you talk to him.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:59.399
You're a friend.
You know him, I don't.

01:07:02.744 --> 01:07:04.735
And Richard!

01:07:05.747 --> 01:07:08.739
Promise anything.

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:16.723
I've got the old boy
this time.

01:07:16.758 --> 01:07:19.761
The damn fool thinks he
loves John. He believes it.

01:07:19.796 --> 01:07:22.423
That's where the knife
goes in...

01:07:26.434 --> 01:07:28.425
knives.

01:07:29.771 --> 01:07:31.762
Knives.

01:07:34.476 --> 01:07:37.468
Where is that mirror? I'm Eleanor,
and I can look at anything.

01:07:39.781 --> 01:07:42.749
My, what a lovely girl.

01:07:42.784 --> 01:07:46.515
How could her king
have left her?

01:08:00.735 --> 01:08:02.726
Philip?

01:08:02.971 --> 01:08:05.735
Philip!

01:08:08.009 --> 01:08:09.976
It's working out. By morning,
I can be the chosen son.

01:08:10.011 --> 01:08:15.016
The crown can come to me. Are you still
with me? We'll have to fight them all.

01:08:15.051 --> 01:08:17.006
They'll band together once this
happens. Have I got your word?

01:08:17.752 --> 01:08:20.755
Do I have yours? All England's
land in France if I support you?

01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:25.024
Are we allies then?
We were born to be.

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:27.727
I should say something solemn,
but I haven't the time.

01:08:27.761 --> 01:08:30.765
I'm off to father with news that
John's a traitor. After that...

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.997
you stink! You know that?
You're a stinker, and you stink.

01:08:36.404 --> 01:08:38.773
I'll kill you!
Ah!

01:08:38.808 --> 01:08:40.138
Lump.

01:08:40.774 --> 01:08:44.040
If you're a prince, there's
hope for every ape in africa.

01:08:44.312 --> 01:08:47.145
I had you saved. I wasn't on
my way to father, but he was.

01:08:47.782 --> 01:08:50.774
He would have gone to Henry and
betrayed you. Look, it's in his face.

01:08:50.919 --> 01:08:54.788
It's true. I don't know
who my friends are.

01:08:54.823 --> 01:09:00.727
Philip?

01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:04.721
May we? That's what tapestries are for.

01:09:06.167 --> 01:09:08.727
I'll never learn.
I'll ruln everything.

01:09:14.743 --> 01:09:18.234
Richard?
Hello, Richard.

01:09:18.747 --> 01:09:22.250
You're halfway to bed. I'll
wait for morning. Come in.

01:09:22.285 --> 01:09:25.242
Mother sent me.
Come in anyway.

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:34.761
Our alchemists have stumbled
on the art of boiling burgundy.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:39.768
It turns to steam, and when it
cools, we call it brandywine.

01:09:39.803 --> 01:09:43.328
I'm Henry's prisoner.
You find that charming?

01:09:43.772 --> 01:09:45.774
No. Then why the charming smile?

01:09:45.809 --> 01:09:47.787
I thought,
I can't think why,

01:09:47.823 --> 01:09:49.767
of when you were
in paris last.

01:09:50.377 --> 01:09:53.381
Can it be two whole years
ago? It can. I need an army.

01:09:53.416 --> 01:09:55.383
It'll take the cold away.
I must have soldiers.

01:09:55.418 --> 01:09:58.752
Have I aged?
Do I seem older to you?

01:09:58.787 --> 01:10:02.780
They've been two fierce years. I've
studied, and I've trained to be a king.

01:10:03.425 --> 01:10:07.429
I'll have your answer... yes or
no? You'll have it when I give it.

01:10:07.464 --> 01:10:09.429
You see?
I've changed.

01:10:09.464 --> 01:10:12.801
I'm not the boy you taught to
hunt two years ago. Remember?

01:10:12.836 --> 01:10:15.463
Racing after boar,
you flying first,

01:10:15.804 --> 01:10:19.808
me scrambling after,
all day into dusk.

01:10:19.843 --> 01:10:23.812
Don't go. I must know. Will you help me?

01:10:23.847 --> 01:10:26.804
Sit and we'll discuss it.

01:10:36.825 --> 01:10:39.559
You never write.
To anyone.

01:10:39.594 --> 01:10:41.824
Why should I make you
king of England?

01:10:42.597 --> 01:10:44.798
Aren't I better off
with John or Geoffrey?

01:10:44.833 --> 01:10:47.836
Why have you to fight when I
could have the cretin or the fiend?

01:10:47.871 --> 01:10:51.636
Would we fight? We're
fighting now. Good night.

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.809
You're still a boy.

01:10:55.844 --> 01:10:59.678
In some ways.
Which way did you have in mind?

01:10:59.848 --> 01:11:03.785
You haven't asked how much your
help is worth. You'll tell me.

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.752
You can have the vexin back.
And what else?

01:11:05.787 --> 01:11:08.517
All of brittany. Does that
matter? That's Geoffrey's.

01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:11.659
Possibly to Geoffrey. And what
else? That's all your help is worth.

01:11:11.694 --> 01:11:13.650
And in return,
what do you want from me?

01:11:13.795 --> 01:11:15.660
Two thousand soldiers.

01:11:15.797 --> 01:11:17.662
- And what else?
- Five hundred knights on horse.

01:11:17.799 --> 01:11:19.766
- And what else?
- Arms and siege equlpment.

01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:24.704
- And what else?
- I never wrote because I thought you'd never answer.

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:30.777
You got married.

01:11:30.812 --> 01:11:34.805
Does that make a difference? Doesn't it?

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:41.779
I've spent two years
on every street in hell.

01:11:45.793 --> 01:11:47.818
That's odd.
I never saw you there.

01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:16.780
You haven't said
you loved me.

01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:25.789
When the time comes.

01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:42.806
Shh.

01:12:57.832 --> 01:12:59.823
It's not too late
at night?

01:13:01.769 --> 01:13:04.737
I'd hoped you'd come.
Good!

01:13:04.772 --> 01:13:07.764
We couldn't leave negotiations
where they were.

01:13:10.778 --> 01:13:13.746
Ah!

01:13:13.781 --> 01:13:17.785
I keep looking for your
father in you. He's not there.

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.776
I'll miss him.

01:13:20.788 --> 01:13:23.791
Has Richard or the queen
been here to see you?

01:13:23.826 --> 01:13:26.759
Does it matter? If they
haven't yet, they will.

01:13:26.794 --> 01:13:30.798
I want to reach a settlement. I
left you with too little earlier.

01:13:30.833 --> 01:13:33.766
Yes.
Nothing is too little.

01:13:33.801 --> 01:13:35.768
I'm sorry
you're not fonder of me, lad.

01:13:35.803 --> 01:13:39.807
Your father always said,
"be fond of stronger men."

01:13:39.842 --> 01:13:41.798
No wonder
he loved everyone.

01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:46.814
I've come to you
to offer peace.

01:13:46.849 --> 01:13:49.806
Piss on your peace.

01:13:50.818 --> 01:13:53.821
Your father would have wept.

01:13:53.856 --> 01:13:55.812
My father was a weeper.

01:13:57.825 --> 01:13:59.816
Fight me, and you'll lose.

01:14:00.762 --> 01:14:02.753
I can't lose, Henry.

01:14:03.765 --> 01:14:06.733
I have time.
Why, just look at you.

01:14:06.768 --> 01:14:10.772
Great heavy arms. But each
year they get a little heavier.

01:14:10.807 --> 01:14:14.793
The sand goes pit-pat
in the glass.

01:14:14.828 --> 01:14:18.745
I'm in no hurry, Henry.
I've got time.

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:22.784
Suppose I hurry things along. Suppose I
say that England is at war with France.

01:14:22.819 --> 01:14:27.754
Then France surrenders. I
don't have to fight to win.

01:14:27.789 --> 01:14:31.782
Take all you want... this county,
that one. You won't keep it long.

01:14:32.794 --> 01:14:35.786
What kind of courage
have you got?

01:14:36.798 --> 01:14:38.789
The tidal kind...

01:14:41.803 --> 01:14:43.794
it comes and goes.

01:14:44.806 --> 01:14:47.774
By God, I'd love to turn you
loose on Eleanor. More brandywine?

01:14:47.809 --> 01:14:52.814
You recognize it? They were boiling
it in ireland before the snakes left.

01:14:52.849 --> 01:14:57.784
Well, things look a little bleak
for Henry, don't they?

01:14:57.819 --> 01:15:02.757
You'll say yes to Richard when he
comes... arms, soldiers, anything he asks.

01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:04.748
I'd be foolish not to.
Yeah.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.753
And withdraw it all before the battle
ever started. Wouldn't you, in my place?

01:15:10.765 --> 01:15:12.767
Why fight Henry when his sons
will do it for you?

01:15:12.802 --> 01:15:15.735
Yes, exactly.

01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:19.763
- You've got promise, lad. That's
first-class thinking. - Thank you, sir.

01:15:33.788 --> 01:15:37.757
Good night. Good night? You're
going? We haven't settled anything.

01:15:37.792 --> 01:15:40.784
We open Christmas presents at noon.
Till then. You can't be finished with me.

01:15:41.796 --> 01:15:44.799
Oh, but I am. It's been most
satisfactory. What's so satisfactory?

01:15:44.834 --> 01:15:49.816
Winning is. I did just
win. Surely you noticed.

01:15:49.851 --> 01:15:54.798
Not a thing. You
haven't won a damn thing.

01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:58.778
Hmm.

01:15:58.813 --> 01:16:02.750
I found out the way your mind
works and the kind of man you are.

01:16:02.785 --> 01:16:04.717
I know your plans
and expectations.

01:16:04.752 --> 01:16:06.719
You've burbled every bit
of strategy you've got.

01:16:06.754 --> 01:16:09.757
I know exactly what you will do
and exactly what you won't.

01:16:09.792 --> 01:16:11.724
And I've told you
exactly nothing!

01:16:11.759 --> 01:16:15.763
To these aged eyes, boy, that's
what winning looks like! Dormez bien.

01:16:15.798 --> 01:16:17.754
You...

01:16:20.268 --> 01:16:23.760
you made my father nothing.

01:16:25.773 --> 01:16:27.764
You were always better.

01:16:28.776 --> 01:16:30.767
You bullied him,

01:16:31.779 --> 01:16:33.746
you bellied with his wife,

01:16:33.781 --> 01:16:36.784
you beat him down
in every war,

01:16:36.819 --> 01:16:39.298
you twisted every treaty,

01:16:39.333 --> 01:16:41.778
you played mock the monk,

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:45.793
and then you made him
love you for it.

01:16:45.828 --> 01:16:48.761
I was there.

01:16:48.796 --> 01:16:51.764
His last words
went to you.

01:16:51.799 --> 01:16:54.802
He was a loving man, and you've
learned nothing of it.

01:16:54.837 --> 01:16:59.772
I learned how much fathers
live in sons.

01:16:59.807 --> 01:17:03.743
A king like you has policy
prepared on everything.

01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:07.737
What's the official line
on sodomy?

01:17:08.015 --> 01:17:12.748
How stands the crown
on boys who do with boys?

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:20.761
Richard finds his way
into so many legends.

01:17:20.796 --> 01:17:23.764
Let's hear yours
and see how it compares.

01:17:23.799 --> 01:17:25.783
He found me first
when I was 15.

01:17:25.818 --> 01:17:27.768
We were hunting.
It was nearly dark.

01:17:27.803 --> 01:17:30.783
My horse fell,
I was thrown.

01:17:30.818 --> 01:17:33.763
I woke to Richard
touching me.

01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:38.773
He asked me
if I loved him.

01:17:38.808 --> 01:17:41.771
"Philip, do you love me?"

01:17:43.784 --> 01:17:45.751
And I told him, "yes."

01:17:45.786 --> 01:17:49.779
Do you know why
I told him yes?

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:54.795
So that one day I could
tell you all about it.

01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:59.284
You cannot imagine
what that "yes" cost.

01:17:59.319 --> 01:18:03.703
Imagine snuggling
to a chancred whore...

01:18:03.738 --> 01:18:07.742
and bending back your lips into
something like a smile, saying,

01:18:07.777 --> 01:18:09.733
"yes,

01:18:10.778 --> 01:18:14.737
"I love you,

01:18:14.782 --> 01:18:17.818
"and I find you...

01:18:17.853 --> 01:18:19.809
beautiful."

01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:24.814
I don't know how I did it.

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:29.858
- No! It wasn't like that!
- But it was.

01:18:32.767 --> 01:18:34.860
You loved me.

01:18:41.776 --> 01:18:43.767
Never.

01:18:52.954 --> 01:18:55.980
Get out. Please.

01:18:56.791 --> 01:18:57.985
I don't want you here.

01:18:58.793 --> 01:19:00.893
It's no great pleasure
to be here.

01:19:00.928 --> 01:19:03.896
So the royal corkscrew
finds me twisted, does he?

01:19:03.931 --> 01:19:07.735
I'll go tell your mother. She'll
be pleased. She knows. She sent me.

01:19:07.770 --> 01:19:10.703
How completely hers you are.

01:19:10.738 --> 01:19:13.975
You've had four sons.
Who do you claim?

01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:15.975
Not Henry.
Not my buried brother.

01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:20.014
Not that monument to muck,
that epic idiot.

01:19:20.049 --> 01:19:22.895
Why him? Why always him and never me?

01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:25.742
He was the eldest.
He came first.

01:19:27.755 --> 01:19:30.758
Christ, Henry,
is that all?

01:19:30.793 --> 01:19:33.056
You went with Eleanor.

01:19:33.361 --> 01:19:37.092
You never called me.
You never said my name.

01:19:38.766 --> 01:19:42.759
I'd have walked. I'd have
crawled. I'd have done anything.

01:19:44.105 --> 01:19:48.132
It's not my fault.
I won't be blamed.

01:19:49.777 --> 01:19:51.768
I only wanted you.

01:19:52.146 --> 01:19:56.183
No, my crown. You want my
kingdom. You keep your kingdom.

01:19:56.218 --> 01:19:58.174
That I will.
I hope it kills you.

01:20:00.187 --> 01:20:04.180
Thank God I have another son.
Thank God for John.

01:20:04.792 --> 01:20:08.228
And who shall we thank for
Geoffrey? You don't think much of me.

01:20:11.799 --> 01:20:14.802
"Much"? I don't think
of you at all.

01:20:14.837 --> 01:20:17.770
Nurse used to say
I had your hands.

01:20:17.805 --> 01:20:21.263
I might have had more of you.
Try seeing me.

01:20:21.542 --> 01:20:24.777
I haven't Richard's military skill,
but he was here betraying you, not I.

01:20:24.812 --> 01:20:30.818
I haven't John's... God knows what you
see in John... and he's betrayed you too.

01:20:30.853 --> 01:20:32.809
You think I'd ever
make you king?

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.811
You'll make me king
because I'm all you've got.

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:39.824
I was to be his chancellor.
Ask him why. I've heard enough.

01:20:40.361 --> 01:20:41.828
For moving John
to treason.

01:20:43.364 --> 01:20:46.400
I don't doubt he offered,
I don't doubt you tried,

01:20:46.435 --> 01:20:49.392
and I don't doubt
John loves me.

01:20:49.837 --> 01:20:51.828
Like a glutton
loves his lunch.

01:20:55.843 --> 01:20:57.834
You turd.

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:08.411
Well, John?

01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:13.392
It isn't what you think.
What do I think?

01:21:13.427 --> 01:21:17.465
What Geoffrey said. I wouldn't
plot against you, ever.

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:20.433
I know.
You're a good boy.

01:21:20.468 --> 01:21:24.370
Can I go now, please? It's
late. I ought to be in bed.

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:36.540
Couldn't you wait? Couldn't
you trust me? It was all yours.

01:21:36.817 --> 01:21:38.819
Couldn't you believe that?
Will you listen to the grief?

01:21:38.854 --> 01:21:41.811
Who do you think I built
this kingdom for? Me!

01:21:42.556 --> 01:21:44.523
Daddy did it all for me.

01:21:44.558 --> 01:21:47.823
When can I have it, daddy?
Not until we bury you?

01:21:47.928 --> 01:21:52.600
- I loved you.
- You're a cold and bloody bastard, you are.

01:21:52.635 --> 01:21:55.592
And you don't love anything.

01:21:58.639 --> 01:22:02.621
I'm it.
I'm all that's left.

01:22:02.656 --> 01:22:06.603
Here, father.
Here I am.

01:22:28.702 --> 01:22:32.798
My life, when it is written,
will read better than it lived.

01:22:33.808 --> 01:22:37.745
Henry fitz-empress, first
plantagenet, a king at 21,

01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.804
the ablest soldier
of an able time.

01:22:41.749 --> 01:22:43.783
He led men well, he cared
for justice when he could...

01:22:43.818 --> 01:22:47.777
and ruled, for 30 years, a state
as great as charlemagne's.

01:22:48.823 --> 01:22:53.759
He married out of love
a woman out of legend.

01:22:53.794 --> 01:22:57.821
Not in alexandria or rome or
camelot has there been such a queen.

01:22:59.834 --> 01:23:03.771
She bore him many children,

01:23:03.806 --> 01:23:05.738
but no sons.

01:23:05.773 --> 01:23:08.765
King Henry had no sons.

01:23:10.778 --> 01:23:15.783
He had three whiskered things,
but he disowned them.

01:23:15.818 --> 01:23:20.788
You're not mine!
We're not connected!

01:23:20.823 --> 01:23:23.756
I deny you!

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:25.758
None of you will get my kingdom.
I leave you nothing!

01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:30.787
And I wish you plague! May all
your children breech and die!

01:23:37.805 --> 01:23:39.796
My boys are gone.

01:23:44.812 --> 01:23:46.803
I've lost my boys.

01:24:06.767 --> 01:24:09.269
You dare to damn me,
do you?

01:24:09.304 --> 01:24:11.772
Well, I'll damn you back.

01:24:11.807 --> 01:24:14.764
Goddamn you!

01:24:20.781 --> 01:24:22.772
My boys are gone.

01:24:24.785 --> 01:24:26.776
I've lost my boys.

01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:33.783
Oh, jesus.

01:24:35.796 --> 01:24:37.787
All my boys.

01:25:50.804 --> 01:25:52.795
Henry?

01:27:46.954 --> 01:27:52.790
<i>The Christmas wine
is in the pot</i>

01:27:54.795 --> 01:27:58.993
<i>The Christmas coals
are red</i>

01:27:59.967 --> 01:28:04.471
<i>I'll spend my day
the lover's way</i>

01:28:04.506 --> 01:28:08.976
<i>Unwrapping all my gifts</i>

01:28:09.011 --> 01:28:12.002
<i>In bed</i>

01:28:14.014 --> 01:28:17.033
<i>The Christmas mass</i>

01:28:17.068 --> 01:28:20.018
<i>Is over now</i>

01:28:20.053 --> 01:28:25.753
<i>The Christmas prayers
are done</i>

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:32.731
No one else is caroling.
It might as well be lent.

01:28:32.766 --> 01:28:37.104
When I was little, Christmas was
a time of great confusion to me.

01:28:37.139 --> 01:28:40.767
The holy land had two kings...
God and uncle raymond.

01:28:41.141 --> 01:28:44.109
I never knew whose birthday
we were celebrating.

01:28:44.144 --> 01:28:47.136
Henry isn't here. Good, we
can talk behind his back.

01:28:47.781 --> 01:28:49.772
What happened?
Don't you know?

01:28:50.184 --> 01:28:53.779
There was a scene with beds and
tapestries, and many things got said.

01:28:54.188 --> 01:28:56.155
Spiced wine.

01:28:56.190 --> 01:29:00.125
I'd forgotten Henry liked it.
May I stay?

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.730
It's your room just as much as
mine. We're both in residence.

01:29:03.765 --> 01:29:06.164
Packed in like the poor,
three to a bed.

01:29:07.734 --> 01:29:09.701
Did you love Henry...
ever?

01:29:09.736 --> 01:29:14.173
Ever? Back before the flood?
As long ago as rosamund.

01:29:14.208 --> 01:29:18.745
Ah, that's prehistory, lamb. There
are no written records or survivors.

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:22.214
There are pictures. She was
prettier than you. Oh, much.

01:29:22.249 --> 01:29:26.253
Her eyes, in certain light, were
violet, and all her teeth were even.

01:29:26.288 --> 01:29:28.220
That's a rare, fair feature...
even teeth.

01:29:28.255 --> 01:29:32.759
She smiled to excess, but she
chewed with real distinction.

01:29:32.794 --> 01:29:34.761
And you hate her
even now.

01:29:34.796 --> 01:29:37.262
No, but I did.

01:29:37.297 --> 01:29:42.535
He put her in my place, you see,
and that was very hard.

01:29:42.570 --> 01:29:47.774
Like you, she headed Henry's
table. That's my chair.

01:29:49.343 --> 01:29:51.862
And so
you had her poisoned.

01:29:51.897 --> 01:29:54.346
No, I never poisoned rosamund.

01:29:54.381 --> 01:29:56.372
Oh, I prayed for her to drop...

01:29:56.783 --> 01:30:00.420
and smiled a little
when she did.

01:30:00.455 --> 01:30:02.754
Why aren't you happy?

01:30:02.789 --> 01:30:07.427
Henry's keeping you. You
must be cleverer than I am.

01:30:07.462 --> 01:30:09.394
I've tried feeling pity
for you,

01:30:09.429 --> 01:30:11.795
but it keeps on turning
into something else.

01:30:12.466 --> 01:30:14.433
Why pity?

01:30:14.468 --> 01:30:18.805
You love Henry, but you
love his kingdom too.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.508
You look at him,
and you see cities,

01:30:21.543 --> 01:30:25.512
acreage, coastline,
taxes.

01:30:25.547 --> 01:30:27.810
All I see is Henry.

01:30:29.516 --> 01:30:31.814
Leave him to me,
can't you?

01:30:33.553 --> 01:30:35.817
I left him years ago.

01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:39.826
And I thought
I could move you.

01:30:39.861 --> 01:30:42.561
Were you always
like this?

01:30:42.596 --> 01:30:45.588
When I was young and worshipped
you, is this what you were like?

01:30:45.832 --> 01:30:48.567
Most likely.

01:30:48.602 --> 01:30:53.630
Child, I'm finished, and I've come
to give him anything he asks for.

01:30:55.642 --> 01:30:59.646
Do you know what I
should like for Christmas?

01:30:59.681 --> 01:31:01.773
I should like
to see you suffer.

01:31:04.785 --> 01:31:08.619
Alais, just for you.

01:31:12.793 --> 01:31:16.786
Alors, ma petite.

01:31:18.665 --> 01:31:21.691
J'ai peur, maman.
No, no.

01:31:34.748 --> 01:31:37.740
The sky is pocked with stars.

01:31:42.823 --> 01:31:47.794
What eyes the wise men must have
had to see a new one in so many.

01:31:47.829 --> 01:31:50.831
You look cold. I've mulled some wine.

01:31:50.866 --> 01:31:53.799
I wonder...
were there fewer stars then?

01:31:53.834 --> 01:31:57.838
I don't know. I fancy
there's a mystery in it.

01:31:57.873 --> 01:32:00.773
What's this?
Warm wine.

01:32:01.775 --> 01:32:03.766
Why, so it is.

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:09.772
You are as beautiful
as I remembered.

01:32:11.785 --> 01:32:12.774
Off you go.
My widow wants to see me.

01:32:13.787 --> 01:32:15.778
She came to find out what
your plans are. I know.

01:32:16.690 --> 01:32:19.784
She wants you back.
Go to your room.

01:32:25.799 --> 01:32:28.791
So, you want me back.

01:32:30.804 --> 01:32:32.771
She thinks I do.

01:32:32.806 --> 01:32:35.809
She thinks the need
for loving never stops.

01:32:35.844 --> 01:32:37.800
She has a point.

01:32:38.812 --> 01:32:40.779
I marvel at you.
After all these years,

01:32:40.814 --> 01:32:43.817
still like a democratic drawbridge,
going down for everybody.

01:32:43.852 --> 01:32:47.810
At my age, there's not
much traffic anymore.

01:32:49.823 --> 01:32:51.814
To your interminable health.

01:32:55.028 --> 01:32:59.833
- Well, wife, what's on your mind?
- I've just seen Richard.

01:32:59.868 --> 01:33:02.996
Splendid boy.
He says you fought.

01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:05.737
We always do.

01:33:05.772 --> 01:33:09.009
It's his impression that
you mean to disinherit them.

01:33:09.044 --> 01:33:11.000
I fancy I'll relent.

01:33:11.578 --> 01:33:14.012
Don't you?
I don't much care.

01:33:14.047 --> 01:33:16.783
In fact, I wonder, Henry,
if I care for anything.

01:33:16.818 --> 01:33:18.774
I wonder if I'm hungry
out of habit.

01:33:19.052 --> 01:33:22.570
I could listen to you lie
for hours.

01:33:22.605 --> 01:33:26.088
So your lust is rusty.
Gorgeous.

01:33:28.094 --> 01:33:30.085
Henry, I'm so tired.

01:33:30.564 --> 01:33:33.800
Sleep then. Sleep and
dream of me withcroutons.

01:33:33.835 --> 01:33:35.767
Henri a la mode.

01:33:35.802 --> 01:33:39.104
- Henry, stop it.
- Eleanor, I haven't started.

01:33:39.139 --> 01:33:42.175
What do you want? You want my
name on paper? I'll sign anything.

01:33:42.210 --> 01:33:44.142
You want the Aquitaine
for John? It's John's.

01:33:44.177 --> 01:33:48.181
It's his, it's yours, it's
anybody's. In exchange for what?

01:33:48.216 --> 01:33:50.217
For nothing.
For a little qulet.

01:33:50.252 --> 01:33:52.231
For an end to this,
for God's sake.

01:33:52.266 --> 01:33:54.210
Sail me back to England,
lock me up...

01:33:54.821 --> 01:33:57.221
and lose the key
and let me be alone.

01:34:02.762 --> 01:34:04.753
You have my oath.

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:10.761
I give my word.
Oh, well.

01:34:12.506 --> 01:34:14.770
Well, well.

01:34:17.244 --> 01:34:21.772
Would you like a pillow?
Footstool? How about a shawl?

01:34:21.982 --> 01:34:26.786
Your oaths are all profanities, your words a
curse, your name on paper is a waste of pulp!

01:34:26.821 --> 01:34:30.278
I'm vilifying you, for
God's sake! Pay attention!

01:34:32.325 --> 01:34:34.316
How,

01:34:34.794 --> 01:34:36.785
from where we started,

01:34:38.331 --> 01:34:41.789
did we ever reach
this Christmas?

01:34:44.804 --> 01:34:46.795
Step by step.

01:34:49.809 --> 01:34:51.776
What happens to me now?

01:34:51.811 --> 01:34:55.815
That's lively curiosity
from such a dead cat.

01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:59.784
If you want to know
my plans, just ask me.

01:34:59.819 --> 01:35:02.379
Conquer china, sack the
vatican, or take the veil.

01:35:02.756 --> 01:35:05.724
I'm not among the ones
who give a damn.

01:35:05.759 --> 01:35:10.397
Just let me sign my lands
to John and go to bed.

01:35:10.432 --> 01:35:12.731
No, you're too kind.
I can't accept.

01:35:12.766 --> 01:35:16.770
Come on, man, I'll sign the thing
in blood or spit or bright blue ink.

01:35:16.805 --> 01:35:19.404
Let's have it done.
Let's not.

01:35:19.439 --> 01:35:23.466
No, I don't think I want
your signature on anything.

01:35:25.779 --> 01:35:28.475
You don't?
Dear God,

01:35:28.782 --> 01:35:32.484
the pleasure I still get
from goading you.

01:35:32.519 --> 01:35:36.656
You don't want John to have
my provinces? Bull's-eye.

01:35:36.691 --> 01:35:40.759
I can't bear you when
you're smug. I know, I know.

01:35:40.794 --> 01:35:45.565
You don't want Richard, and you
don't want John. You've grasped it.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:48.767
All right, then,
shatter me!

01:35:48.802 --> 01:35:53.603
Let me have it.
What do you want?

01:35:55.809 --> 01:35:57.800
A new wife.

01:36:05.752 --> 01:36:07.743
Oh.

01:36:10.757 --> 01:36:13.725
So,

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.752
I'm to be annulled.

01:36:20.634 --> 01:36:24.661
Well,
will the pope annul me,

01:36:24.771 --> 01:36:26.638
do you think?

01:36:26.673 --> 01:36:30.575
The pontiff owes me one
pontificate. I think he will.

01:36:31.778 --> 01:36:34.241
Out Eleanor,

01:36:34.276 --> 01:36:36.705
in alais.

01:36:39.719 --> 01:36:44.782
- Why?
- A new wife, wife, will bear me sons.

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:49.786
That is the single thing...

01:36:50.764 --> 01:36:54.801
of which I would have thought
you had enough.

01:36:54.836 --> 01:36:57.769
I want a son.
We could populate...

01:36:57.804 --> 01:37:02.742
a country town with country
girls who've borne you sons.

01:37:02.777 --> 01:37:05.745
How many is it?
Help me count the bastards.

01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:07.736
All my sons are bastards.

01:37:15.755 --> 01:37:19.748
You really mean to do it.
Lady love, with all my heart.

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.727
Your sons are part of you.

01:37:22.762 --> 01:37:25.765
Like warts and goiters,
and I'm having them removed.

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:28.785
We've made them.
They're our boys.

01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:31.296
I know, and good God,
look at them.

01:37:31.331 --> 01:37:33.738
Geoffrey...
there's a masterpiece.

01:37:33.773 --> 01:37:37.766
He isn't flesh, he's a device.
He's wheels and gears.

01:37:38.344 --> 01:37:41.746
And johnny...

01:37:41.781 --> 01:37:44.773
was his latest treason
your idea?

01:37:46.786 --> 01:37:50.755
I caught him lying,
and I've said, "he's young."

01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:53.758
I found him cheating, and
I've said, "he's just a boy."

01:37:53.793 --> 01:37:58.798
I've watched him steal and whore and
whip his servants, and he's not a child.

01:37:58.833 --> 01:38:01.785
He's the man we made him.

01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:04.703
Don't share John with me.

01:38:04.738 --> 01:38:08.731
He's your accomplishment.
And Richard's yours.

01:38:10.744 --> 01:38:13.736
How could you send him off
to deal with Philip?

01:38:15.749 --> 01:38:17.745
I was tired.

01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:19.742
I was busy.

01:38:20.754 --> 01:38:22.721
They were friends.

01:38:22.756 --> 01:38:25.748
Eleanor, he was the best.

01:38:27.761 --> 01:38:31.765
From the cradle on, you cradled
him. I never had a chance.

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.757
You never wanted one. How
do you know? You took him.

01:38:35.769 --> 01:38:38.772
Separation from your husband
you could bear, but not your son.

01:38:38.807 --> 01:38:41.792
Whatever I have done,
you made me do.

01:38:41.827 --> 01:38:44.303
You threw me out of bed
for Richard.

01:38:44.338 --> 01:38:46.745
Not until you threw me out
for rosamund.

01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:52.786
It's not that simple. I won't
have it to be that simple.

01:38:52.821 --> 01:38:56.790
I adored you.
Never.

01:38:56.825 --> 01:38:59.758
I still do.

01:38:59.793 --> 01:39:02.729
Of all the lies,
that one is the most terrible.

01:39:02.764 --> 01:39:07.723
I know. That's why
I saved it up for now.

01:39:19.746 --> 01:39:24.740
Oh, Henry, we've mangled
everything we've touched.

01:39:25.752 --> 01:39:29.745
Deny us what you will,
we have done that.

01:39:32.759 --> 01:39:36.728
Do you remember when we met?

01:39:36.763 --> 01:39:40.756
Down to the hour
and color of your stockings.

01:39:45.772 --> 01:39:49.776
I could hardly see you
for the sunlight.

01:39:49.811 --> 01:39:52.768
It was raining,
but no matter.

01:39:56.783 --> 01:40:00.787
There was very little talk,
as I recall.

01:40:00.822 --> 01:40:02.754
Very little.

01:40:02.789 --> 01:40:06.287
I had never seen
such beauty.

01:40:06.322 --> 01:40:09.785
I walked right up
and touched it.

01:40:11.798 --> 01:40:14.801
God, where did I find
the gall to do that?

01:40:14.836 --> 01:40:17.793
In my eyes.

01:40:18.805 --> 01:40:20.796
I loved you.

01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:36.788
No annulment.

01:40:36.823 --> 01:40:40.816
What? There will be no annulment.

01:40:40.894 --> 01:40:44.831
Will there not? No, I'm afraid
you'll have to do without.

01:40:44.866 --> 01:40:47.899
Well, it was
just a whim.

01:40:47.934 --> 01:40:51.927
I'm so relieved.
I didn't want to lose you.

01:40:53.973 --> 01:40:58.967
Out of curiosity, as
intellectual to intellectual,

01:40:59.846 --> 01:41:02.781
how in the name of bleeding
jesus can you lose me?

01:41:04.784 --> 01:41:05.944
Do we ever see each other?
Am I ever near you?

01:41:06.786 --> 01:41:08.947
Ever with you? Am I ever
anywhere but somewhere else?

01:41:09.789 --> 01:41:11.756
Do I write?
Do we send messages?

01:41:11.791 --> 01:41:15.795
Do dinghies bearing gifts float up
the thames to you? Are you remembered?

01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:17.762
You are.

01:41:17.797 --> 01:41:21.801
You're no part of me. We
do not touch at any point.

01:41:21.836 --> 01:41:25.316
How can you lose me?
Can't you feel the chains?

01:41:25.351 --> 01:41:28.797
You know me well enough
to know I can't be stopped.

01:41:29.042 --> 01:41:32.777
I don't have to stop you.
I have only to delay you.

01:41:32.812 --> 01:41:38.084
Every enemy you have has friends
in rome. We'll cost you time.

01:41:38.119 --> 01:41:41.786
What is this?
I'm not moldering.

01:41:41.821 --> 01:41:46.121
My paint's not peeling. I'm
good for years. How many years?

01:41:46.392 --> 01:41:51.113
Suppose I hold you back for one.
I can. It's possible.

01:41:51.148 --> 01:41:55.835
Suppose your first son dies.
Ours did. It's possible.

01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:59.172
Suppose you're daughtered next.
We were.

01:41:59.207 --> 01:42:02.492
That, too,
is possible.

01:42:02.527 --> 01:42:05.654
How old is daddy then?

01:42:05.689 --> 01:42:08.746
What kind of spindly,

01:42:08.781 --> 01:42:12.750
rickett-ridden, milky,
wizened, dim-eyed,

01:42:12.785 --> 01:42:18.791
gammy-handed, limpy line
of things will you beget?

01:42:18.826 --> 01:42:20.758
It's sweet of you to care.

01:42:20.793 --> 01:42:25.798
And when you die, which is
regrettable but necessary,

01:42:25.833 --> 01:42:30.768
what will happen to frail alais
and her pruney prince?

01:42:30.803 --> 01:42:35.797
You can't think Richard's going
to wait for your grotesque to grow.

01:42:36.809 --> 01:42:39.777
You wouldn't let him
do a thing like that?

01:42:39.812 --> 01:42:43.805
Let him? I'd push him
through the nursery door.

01:42:44.817 --> 01:42:47.785
You're not that cruel.

01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:51.824
Don't fret. We'll wait
until you're dead to do it.

01:42:51.859 --> 01:42:55.793
Eleanor, what do you want?

01:42:55.828 --> 01:42:57.795
Just what you want...
a king for a son.

01:42:57.830 --> 01:43:01.733
You can make more, I can't.
You think I want to disappear?

01:43:01.768 --> 01:43:06.762
One son is all I've got, and you
can blot him out and call me cruel?

01:43:07.607 --> 01:43:10.777
For these ten years, you've
lived with everything I've lost...

01:43:10.812 --> 01:43:14.781
and loved another woman
through it all, and I am cruel?

01:43:14.816 --> 01:43:16.781
I could peel you like a pear,

01:43:16.816 --> 01:43:20.843
and God himself
would call it justice.

01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:25.849
I will die sometime soon.

01:43:26.859 --> 01:43:29.761
One day I'll duck too slow,
and at westminster,

01:43:29.796 --> 01:43:31.898
they'll sing out "long live
the king" for someone else.

01:43:31.933 --> 01:43:34.801
I beg you, let it be
a son of mine.

01:43:34.836 --> 01:43:39.771
I am not moved to tears.

01:43:39.806 --> 01:43:44.800
I have no sons. You have too
many sons. You don't need more.

01:43:49.816 --> 01:43:51.783
Well, wish me luck.
I'm off.

01:43:51.818 --> 01:43:54.810
To rome? That's where
they keep the pope.

01:43:54.987 --> 01:43:57.789
You don't dare go!

01:43:57.824 --> 01:44:00.725
Say that again at noon.
You'll say it to my horse's ass.

01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.764
Lamb, I'll be rid of you by easter!
You can count your reigning days!

01:44:04.799 --> 01:44:06.731
You go to rome,
we'll rise against you!

01:44:06.766 --> 01:44:08.961
Who will? Richard, Geoffrey,
John and Eleanor of Aquitaine.

01:44:09.769 --> 01:44:13.000
The day those stout hearts band
together is the day that pigs get wings!

01:44:13.773 --> 01:44:16.765
There'll be pork in the treetops
come morning!

01:44:18.010 --> 01:44:21.036
Don't you see you've given them
a common cause: New sons?

01:44:21.781 --> 01:44:23.772
You leave the country,
and you've lost it.

01:44:26.786 --> 01:44:30.779
- All of you at once?
- And Philip too. He'd join us.

01:44:32.091 --> 01:44:34.082
Yes, he would.

01:44:35.795 --> 01:44:39.788
Now how's your trip
to rome?

01:44:40.133 --> 01:44:44.769
Oh, I've got you,
got you, got you.

01:44:44.804 --> 01:44:48.808
Should I take a thousand
men-at-arms, or is that showy?

01:44:48.843 --> 01:44:51.142
Bluff away.

01:44:51.177 --> 01:44:55.807
Ah, poor thing. How can I break
the news? You've just miscalculated.

01:44:56.182 --> 01:44:58.173
Have I? How?

01:44:58.818 --> 01:45:02.989
You should have lied. You should have
promised to be good while I was gone.

01:45:03.024 --> 01:45:07.160
I would have let your three boys
loose. They could have fought me then.

01:45:07.195 --> 01:45:09.196
You wouldn't keep your sons
locked up here.

01:45:09.231 --> 01:45:11.162
Why the devil wouldn't I?
You wouldn't dare.

01:45:11.197 --> 01:45:14.189
Why not? Let them sit in
chinon for a while. I forbid it.

01:45:14.467 --> 01:45:18.767
She forbids it. Did your father
sleep with me, or didn't he?

01:45:20.773 --> 01:45:25.010
No doubt you're going to tell me
that he did. Would it upset you?

01:45:25.045 --> 01:45:29.213
What about the thousand men? I
say be gaudy and to hell with it.

01:45:29.248 --> 01:45:33.286
Don't leave me, Henry. I'm at rock
bottom. I'll do anything to keep you.

01:45:33.321 --> 01:45:36.754
I think you think you
mean it. Ask for something.

01:45:36.789 --> 01:45:40.316
Eleanor, we're passed it, years
passed. Test me. Name an act.

01:45:40.793 --> 01:45:44.295
There isn't one! About my
fornication with your father.

01:45:44.330 --> 01:45:47.322
Yes, there is. You can expire. You first,
old man. I only hope I'm there to watch.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:53.363
You're so afraid of dying. You're
so scared of it. Ah, poor Eleanor.

01:45:53.806 --> 01:45:59.378
If only she'd lied. She did. She
said she never loved your father.

01:45:59.413 --> 01:46:01.312
I can always count on you.

01:46:01.347 --> 01:46:04.339
I never touched you without
thinking, "Geoffrey, Geoffrey."

01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:07.718
The day you hurt me,
I'll cry out.

01:46:07.753 --> 01:46:10.721
I've put more horns on you
than Louis ever wore.

01:46:10.756 --> 01:46:13.384
Am I supposed to care?
I'll kill you if you leave me.

01:46:13.759 --> 01:46:19.363
You can try. I loved your
father's body. He was beautiful.

01:46:19.398 --> 01:46:23.436
It never happened. I can see his
body now. Shall I describe it?

01:46:23.471 --> 01:46:25.427
Eleanor, I hope you die!
His arms were rough,

01:46:25.771 --> 01:46:27.405
with scars here.
No!

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.476
I can feel his arms!
I feel them!

01:46:32.778 --> 01:46:36.747
I feel it!

01:46:36.782 --> 01:46:39.478
What?
Have I hurt you?

01:46:40.786 --> 01:46:42.753
Let me finish!

01:46:42.788 --> 01:46:45.780
You were in the next room
when he did it!

01:47:03.542 --> 01:47:05.509
Well,

01:47:05.544 --> 01:47:09.742
what family doesn't have
its ups and downs?

01:47:14.754 --> 01:47:16.585
I'm cold.

01:47:17.757 --> 01:47:20.624
I can't feel anything.

01:47:21.761 --> 01:47:23.752
Not anything at all.

01:47:26.766 --> 01:47:31.669
We couldn't go back,
could we, Henry?

01:47:36.776 --> 01:47:39.677
William!

01:47:44.150 --> 01:47:48.177
Up! Up!

01:47:55.928 --> 01:47:59.796
When the king is off his ass,
nobody sleeps!

01:50:10.663 --> 01:50:12.790
Up! Up!

01:50:13.666 --> 01:50:14.792
Up! Up!

01:50:22.808 --> 01:50:25.800
Tell her to pack. She
leaves when it's light.

01:50:45.831 --> 01:50:47.799
Up, up!

01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:50.788
- Henry?
- We're packing up and moving out.

01:52:50.823 --> 01:52:54.827
Is there a war? What's happened?
Henry, what's the matter?

01:52:54.862 --> 01:52:56.818
Nothing, for a change.
Would you believe it?

01:52:56.962 --> 01:53:00.766
Where have you been all night?
What for? Making us an entourage.

01:53:00.801 --> 01:53:02.757
We're off to rome
to see the pope.

01:53:03.769 --> 01:53:04.758
He's excommunicated you again.

01:53:05.771 --> 01:53:09.740
No, he's going to set me free.
I'm having Eleanor annulled.

01:53:09.775 --> 01:53:12.778
The nation will be shocked to learn
our marriage wasn't consummated.

01:53:12.813 --> 01:53:14.745
Oh, be serious.
I am.

01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:17.772
It seems that you and I
are getting married.

01:53:19.785 --> 01:53:21.776
By the pope himself.

01:53:25.791 --> 01:53:28.288
You mean it?

01:53:28.323 --> 01:53:30.785
Shall I kneel?

01:53:31.797 --> 01:53:37.793
It's not another trick? The bridal
party's drilling on the cobblestones.

01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:58.789
- She'll find a way to stop us.
- How? She won't be here.

01:53:58.824 --> 01:54:00.759
We're launching her for salisbury
tower when the winds change.

01:54:00.794 --> 01:54:02.761
She'll be barging down
the river by lunchtime.

01:54:02.796 --> 01:54:04.728
If she doesn't stop us,
Richard will.

01:54:04.763 --> 01:54:08.767
Not anymore, I've corked him up. He's in
the cellar with his brothers and the wine.

01:54:08.802 --> 01:54:12.771
The royal boys are aging with the
royal port. You haven't said yes.

01:54:12.806 --> 01:54:14.738
Would you like
a formal declaration?

01:54:14.773 --> 01:54:18.766
There, my finest angle.
It's on all the coins.

01:54:19.812 --> 01:54:23.771
Sad alais,
will you marry me?

01:54:24.817 --> 01:54:27.751
Be my queen.

01:54:27.786 --> 01:54:29.845
We'll love each other,
and you'll give me sons.

01:54:30.789 --> 01:54:33.325
Let's have six. We'll
do Eleanor one better.

01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:35.826
We'll call the first one
Louis, if you like.

01:54:35.861 --> 01:54:39.797
Louls le premier. How's
that for a king of England?

01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:50.807
Henry, you can't ever
let them out.

01:54:51.810 --> 01:54:55.779
You've lost me. Let who out? Your sons.

01:54:55.814 --> 01:55:00.911
You've put them in the dungeon, and
you've got to keep them there forever.

01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:04.838
Do I now? If they're free when you die,

01:55:04.873 --> 01:55:07.756
it's the dungeon
or the nunnery for me.

01:55:08.761 --> 01:55:10.956
But, Henry,
what about the child?

01:55:11.764 --> 01:55:13.766
Don't bother me about the child.
The damn thing isn't born yet.

01:55:13.801 --> 01:55:15.733
If they're free,
they'll kill it.

01:55:15.768 --> 01:55:21.001
And I will not live to see
our children murdered.

01:55:25.778 --> 01:55:27.769
Henry!

01:55:30.783 --> 01:55:33.047
Are you going down?

01:55:36.789 --> 01:55:40.782
To let them out
or to keep them in?

01:55:46.098 --> 01:55:50.100
Could you say
to a child of yours,

01:55:50.135 --> 01:55:53.798
"you've seen the sunlight
for the last time"?

01:55:56.141 --> 01:55:59.804
Can you do it, Henry?

01:56:00.746 --> 01:56:04.116
I shall have to,

01:56:04.151 --> 01:56:06.107
shan't I?

01:58:54.786 --> 01:58:56.777
He's here.

01:58:58.790 --> 01:59:03.261
He'll get no satisfaction out of
me. He isn't going to see me beg.

01:59:03.296 --> 01:59:07.733
Why, you chivalric fool, as if
the way one fell down mattered.

01:59:07.768 --> 01:59:10.725
When the fall is all there is,
it matters.

01:59:30.756 --> 01:59:32.723
My barge is sailing
with the tide.

01:59:32.758 --> 01:59:34.749
- I've come to say good-bye.
- Does Henry know you're here?

01:59:35.761 --> 01:59:37.752
I've brought you each a little
something. What's he planning?

01:59:38.130 --> 01:59:40.758
Is he going to keep us here? For God's
sake, mother. I picked it out especially.

01:59:47.773 --> 01:59:49.740
- How heavy is the outside guard?
- That's taken care of.

01:59:49.775 --> 01:59:52.778
The courtyard, the gates? They're putting
Henry's train together, and it's chaos.

01:59:52.813 --> 01:59:54.778
You can walk right out. We'll go
to poitiers. He'll expect that.

01:59:54.813 --> 01:59:57.299
But we'll meet him with an army
when he comes. You stick close to me.

01:59:57.334 --> 01:59:59.785
When you run, run hard. Why run
at all? I think we ought to stay.

01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:02.788
Stay here? Till Henry comes.
He will come, won't he?

02:00:02.823 --> 02:00:05.756
And he'll come alone.

02:00:05.791 --> 02:00:08.293
I count three knives to
one. You think we could?

02:00:08.328 --> 02:00:10.796
I'd only do it wrong.
You kill him, I'll watch.

02:00:10.831 --> 02:00:12.863
- Where are you going?
- Up for air.

02:00:12.898 --> 02:00:16.867
Don't stop her. You don't
think I'm gonna let this happen.

02:00:16.902 --> 02:00:20.806
If you tell, there'll be a rash of
executions, and you don't want that.

02:00:20.841 --> 02:00:22.933
No, you don't want to lose
one of us, not even me.

02:00:23.809 --> 02:00:25.909
You're clever, but I
wonder if you're right.

02:00:25.944 --> 02:00:29.815
Warn him, it's the end of us. You
warn him not, it's the end of him.

02:00:29.850 --> 02:00:33.819
It's that clear.
Take the knives and run.

02:00:33.854 --> 02:00:36.339
No, Geoffrey's right.

02:00:36.374 --> 02:00:39.100
You're not an assassin.

02:00:39.135 --> 02:00:41.792
Look again.
Richard.

02:00:41.827 --> 02:00:45.030
Spare me that. You brought these
things. You want him dead? You do it.

02:00:45.065 --> 02:00:47.998
You unnatural animal.

02:00:48.033 --> 02:00:51.001
Unnatural, mummy? You tell
me, what's nature's way?

02:00:51.036 --> 02:00:54.840
If poison mushrooms grow and
babies come with crooked backs,

02:00:54.875 --> 02:00:56.807
if goiters thrive
and dogs go mad...

02:00:56.842 --> 02:00:59.976
and wives kill husbands,
what's unnatural?

02:01:00.011 --> 02:01:03.037
Come, here stands your lamb. Come
cover him in kisses. He's all yours.

02:01:03.782 --> 02:01:08.752
No, you're not mine.
I'm not responsible.

02:01:08.787 --> 02:01:11.790
Where do you think I learned this
from? Who do you think I studied under?

02:01:11.825 --> 02:01:14.758
How old was I when you fought with
Henry first? Young. I don't know.

02:01:14.793 --> 02:01:18.762
How many battles did I watch? But those
were battles, not a knife behind a door.

02:01:18.797 --> 02:01:22.130
I never heard a corpse ask how it got so cold.
What were you thinking when you fought him?

02:01:22.801 --> 02:01:25.137
You. I did it all for you!
Of your unnatural animal?

02:01:25.172 --> 02:01:27.771
You wanted father dead.
No, never that.

02:01:27.806 --> 02:01:31.810
You tried to kill him.
Why? What did you want? Yes!

02:01:31.845 --> 02:01:35.177
I wanted Henry back.

02:01:37.182 --> 02:01:39.173
Liar!

02:01:40.819 --> 02:01:44.220
I wanted Henry.

02:01:44.823 --> 02:01:48.224
Don't trust her. She'll
warn him if she gets a chance.

02:01:52.831 --> 02:01:57.268
Dear, dear, whatever
shall we do with mother?

02:02:34.906 --> 02:02:37.374
It wants light.

02:02:42.414 --> 02:02:47.408
What we do in dungeons
needs the shades of day.

02:02:49.821 --> 02:02:51.788
I stole the candles
from the chapel.

02:02:51.823 --> 02:02:56.828
Jesus won't begrudge them,
and the chaplain works for me.

02:02:56.863 --> 02:03:00.389
You look dreadful.
So do you.

02:03:01.766 --> 02:03:04.428
I underslept a little.

02:03:06.771 --> 02:03:09.763
We can all rest
in a little while.

02:03:14.779 --> 02:03:18.476
There, that's better.

02:03:18.783 --> 02:03:22.776
Bright and clear,
just like the morning.

02:03:23.521 --> 02:03:25.785
Fine looking boy.

02:03:29.527 --> 02:03:32.762
What do you want from us?
You must be mad.

02:03:32.797 --> 02:03:36.790
Why did you have to come here?
Damn it, why did you come?

02:03:37.569 --> 02:03:40.083
You were the best.

02:03:40.118 --> 02:03:42.597
I told her so.

02:03:42.807 --> 02:03:44.774
You, I loved.

02:03:44.809 --> 02:03:47.801
You're going to keep us here.

02:03:48.613 --> 02:03:52.651
You can't ever let me out.
You know you can't.

02:03:52.686 --> 02:03:54.642
I'll never stop.

02:03:55.654 --> 02:03:57.815
I can't stop either.

02:04:28.153 --> 02:04:29.780
Brave boys...

02:04:30.789 --> 02:04:32.780
that's what I have.

02:04:39.331 --> 02:04:41.799
Come for me.

02:05:04.756 --> 02:05:07.759
What's wrong?
You're Richard, aren't you?

02:05:07.794 --> 02:05:09.726
But you're Henry.

02:05:09.761 --> 02:05:14.766
Please, take me back.
Can't we try again?

02:05:14.801 --> 02:05:16.757
Again?
We always have before.

02:05:17.302 --> 02:05:21.762
Oh, yes,
we always have.

02:05:26.811 --> 02:05:29.803
Go on!

02:05:38.857 --> 02:05:40.848
Execute him.

02:05:43.795 --> 02:05:45.854
They're assassins,
aren't they?

02:05:46.898 --> 02:05:49.890
This was treason, wasn't it?

02:05:50.802 --> 02:05:55.796
You gave them life.
You take it.

02:06:02.747 --> 02:06:06.911
Who's to say it's monstrous?
I'm the king. I call it just.

02:06:14.759 --> 02:06:16.954
Therefore, I, Henry,
by the grace of God,

02:06:17.762 --> 02:06:21.755
king of the english, lord of
scotland, ireland and wales,

02:06:21.966 --> 02:06:24.764
count of anjou, brittany,
poutou and normandy,

02:06:24.969 --> 02:06:26.994
maine,
gascony and Aquitaine,

02:06:28.773 --> 02:06:31.741
do sentence you to death.

02:06:31.776 --> 02:06:36.008
Done this Christmas day
in chinon in God's year 1183.

02:07:23.161 --> 02:07:25.755
Surely that's not
what I intended.

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:31.191
Children.

02:07:32.770 --> 02:07:34.761
Children.

02:07:38.776 --> 02:07:40.767
They're all we have.

02:07:43.781 --> 02:07:45.772
Go on.

02:07:47.285 --> 02:07:49.276
I'm done.

02:07:51.789 --> 02:07:53.780
I'm finished with you.

02:07:55.293 --> 02:07:57.318
You and I are finished.

02:08:25.356 --> 02:08:29.759
You spare the rod,
you'll spoil those boys.

02:08:35.767 --> 02:08:38.429
I couldn't do it, Eleanor.

02:08:40.438 --> 02:08:42.770
Nobody thought you could.

02:08:50.481 --> 02:08:52.472
Come rest.

02:08:53.484 --> 02:08:58.512
I want no women in
my life. You're tired.

02:08:58.790 --> 02:09:02.460
I could have conquered europe,
all of it,

02:09:02.495 --> 02:09:04.724
but I had women in my life.

02:09:06.731 --> 02:09:09.495
Go on, get out.
Go on.

02:09:18.543 --> 02:09:22.536
I should have
killed you years ago.

02:09:22.747 --> 02:09:26.547
You put me here. You made me
do mad things. You've bled me.

02:09:26.751 --> 02:09:29.669
Shoulder it yourself.

02:09:29.704 --> 02:09:32.587
Don't put it on my back.

02:09:32.757 --> 02:09:35.749
Pick it up and carry it.
I can.

02:09:36.594 --> 02:09:39.764
My losses are my work.

02:09:39.799 --> 02:09:41.731
What losses?

02:09:41.766 --> 02:09:44.633
I'm the one with nothing.

02:09:44.769 --> 02:09:47.670
Lost your life's work,
have you?

02:09:48.773 --> 02:09:51.776
Provinces are nothing.

02:09:51.811 --> 02:09:54.744
Land is dirt.

02:09:54.779 --> 02:10:00.718
I could take defeats like
yours and laugh. I've done it.

02:10:00.753 --> 02:10:03.778
If you're broken,
it's because you're brittle.

02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:08.776
I've lost.

02:10:08.811 --> 02:10:11.762
You won.

02:10:11.796 --> 02:10:15.755
And I can't ever
have you back again.

02:10:17.802 --> 02:10:21.795
You're all
that I have ever loved.

02:10:23.808 --> 02:10:27.801
Christ, you don't know
what nothing is.

02:10:28.813 --> 02:10:31.816
I want to die.
No, you don't.

02:10:31.851 --> 02:10:35.337
I want to die.
I'll hold you.

02:10:35.372 --> 02:10:38.599
Henry, I want to die.
Eleanor.

02:10:38.634 --> 02:10:41.826
I want to die.
Let me hold you.

02:10:41.861 --> 02:10:43.817
I want to die.

02:10:44.829 --> 02:10:47.797
You will, you know,
someday.

02:10:47.832 --> 02:10:49.834
Just wait long enough,
and it'll happen.

02:10:54.839 --> 02:10:56.830
So it will.

02:11:01.779 --> 02:11:05.783
We're in the cellar,
you're going back to prison,

02:11:05.818 --> 02:11:10.788
my life is wasted,
we've lost each other,

02:11:10.823 --> 02:11:12.779
and you're smiling.

02:11:14.792 --> 02:11:17.784
It's the way
I register despair.

02:11:21.799 --> 02:11:24.791
There's everything in life
but hope.

02:11:27.805 --> 02:11:29.796
We're both alive.

02:11:31.809 --> 02:11:34.801
And for all I know,
that's what hope is.

02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:45.812
We're jungle creatures,
Henry,

02:11:47.825 --> 02:11:51.818
and the dark
is all around us.

02:11:53.831 --> 02:11:57.835
See them...
in the corners?

02:11:57.870 --> 02:12:00.770
You can see the eyes.

02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:10.771
And they can see ours.

02:12:20.792 --> 02:12:22.783
I'm a match for anything.

02:12:24.796 --> 02:12:26.763
Aren't you?

02:12:26.798 --> 02:12:30.802
I should have been
a great fool...

02:12:30.837 --> 02:12:32.793
not to love you.

02:12:50.822 --> 02:12:52.789
You'll let me out
for easter?

02:12:52.824 --> 02:12:56.828
Come the resurrection,
you can strike me down again.

02:12:56.863 --> 02:12:58.830
Perhaps next time
I'll do it.

02:12:58.865 --> 02:13:01.765
And perhaps you won't.

02:13:10.775 --> 02:13:14.779
You know,
I hope we never die!

02:13:14.814 --> 02:13:16.770
So do I.

02:13:16.981 --> 02:13:19.784
You think there's
any chance of it?
