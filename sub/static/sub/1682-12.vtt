(WHIMPERING) There's nothing else
you could do?

11:27.253 --> 11:31.713
No. But there is another suit
that can use the buttons from your suit.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.759
That can... Like an organ donor?

11:35.194 --> 11:38.357
Your suit's death
could mean another suit's life.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.457
Oh, my God.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.230
Do it.

You're doing the right thing.

11:50.576 --> 11:52.407
Please don't cry on this.

- (CRYING) I'm sorry.

His buttons saved the life

12:05.591 --> 12:07.889
of a sick little jacket
on the Upper East Side.

12:09.762 --> 12:12.322
Well, at least now you
can finally drop this quest

12:12.398 --> 12:14.093
for the so-called hot bartender.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.531
No.

12:15.601 --> 12:19.401
My suit gave its life for this cause,

12:19.472 --> 12:23.101

12:23.175 --> 12:27.373
I mean, that... I mean, she is mine.

He's absolutely right.

12:33.519 --> 12:37.250
Who, the guy kissing a jar
full of dead suit ashes? That guy?

12:37.323 --> 12:39.382
What if Cindy is the woman
I'm supposed to marry,

12:39.458 --> 12:40.482
and I'm just giving up?

12:41.026 --> 12:43.824
So long, elegant yet welcoming
home in Westchester

12:43.896 --> 12:46.922
with a sensible mortgage I can handle
without dipping into my savings.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.991
Bye-bye, two kids I raised with
a stern yet loving hand,

12:50.069 --> 12:52.731
finding the perfect balance
between father and friend.

- Ted!
- Ted!

12:57.109 --> 13:00.044
The point is, I'm not giving up, either!

13:04.283 --> 13:06.012
I don't know why I just did that.

13:08.888 --> 13:11.049
Barney, I'm so sorry about your friend.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.720
- Tell me about him.
- Huh.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.591
He was Italian.

13:16.228 --> 13:17.820
Classy, elegant.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.528
And boy, did he have a way
with the ladies.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.533
They just couldn't say no.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.068
- How old was he?
- Seven.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.396
(CRYING) I miss him so much!

13:29.008 --> 13:30.942
You shouldn't be alone tonight.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.240
I'm gonna end my shift early.

13:35.181 --> 13:36.580
Thank you, old friend.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.110
You're going out with a bang.

13:41.453 --> 13:44.183
Come on, Marshall.
Just admit that she's hotter than me.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.850
- I won't be hurt.
- Can't do it.

13:46.926 --> 13:49.451
- You're hotter.
- She's a goddess!

13:49.528 --> 13:52.929
Her skin glows. Her legs go for miles.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.399
And that ass?
I would wear that thing for a hat.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.571
Last night in bed, I'll admit it,

13:59.638 --> 14:01.299
she popped into my head
a couple of times.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.398
Whoa. What are you trip...

14:04.109 --> 14:05.974
Like, you think she's hotter than me?

14:07.546 --> 14:08.808
I never said that.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.381
Oh, my God! You do.

14:10.449 --> 14:13.976
Well, it's apples and oranges.
She's younger than you.

14:14.053 --> 14:18.717
Well, I'm just saying, like,
me in my prime versus her in her prime.

14:18.824 --> 14:20.189
- Well...
- Oh, my God!

14:20.259 --> 14:23.353
You guys, her hotness isn't even real!

14:24.029 --> 14:26.497
It's circumstantial hotness.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.061
Watch.

14:31.770 --> 14:34.000
(MAN SINGING) <i>She's my cherry pie</i>

14:48.754 --> 14:50.619
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

14:50.689 --> 14:54.318
- You're not allowed back here.
- Oh, no. Uh, I... Carl, look.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.089
(STUTTERING) No. I don't want to go back.

14:57.162 --> 14:59.596
Please, please,
just don't make me go back.

14:59.665 --> 15:00.723
- You got to go.
- Don't. I...

15:00.799 --> 15:02.232
- You got to go.
- I just... No, Carl. I was...

15:02.301 --> 15:03.893

15:19.385 --> 15:20.977
My roommate's
just about to get out of the shower.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.918
- Let's talk in my room.
- Okay.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.995
(SIGHS) Look, Cindy, I know
the university rulebook says we can't date.

15:36.068 --> 15:39.299
But it also says, "Don't teach drunk,"
and I do that all the time.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.274
The point is, I like you.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.869
I do. You're sweet, you're funny.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.837
You're writing a dissertation entitled
"Foreign Direct Investment

15:47.913 --> 15:50.279
"and Intergenerational Linkages
in Consumption Behavior."

15:50.349 --> 15:51.816
I mean, that is hot.

15:53.419 --> 15:56.183
I know this sounds crazy,

15:56.255 --> 15:59.247
but I feel like our paths
are supposed to cross somehow.

15:59.325 --> 16:02.556
And I don't want to miss out
on knowing you.

16:03.395 --> 16:05.920
I don't want to miss out on
knowing you, either.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.799
Look, I got to tell you,

16:09.868 --> 16:11.358
I mean, just from looking around
your room,

16:11.437 --> 16:13.632
I can tell we have a ton in common.

16:14.106 --> 16:16.267
- Really?
- The Unicorns?

Well, well, what about this?

16:29.054 --> 16:31.352

from my roommate.

Haven't checked it out yet.

16:32.791 --> 16:33.883
Oh.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.858
Oh, you should. It's a good read.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.096
What about this? This is ridiculous.

16:39.365 --> 16:42.129
You play bass? Seriously, ask my friends.

I always say, " My ideal woman

- She's in a band.
- Damn, that's cool.

This is unbelievable.

a moment of silence.
