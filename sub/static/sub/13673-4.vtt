WEBVTT

00:07.550 --> 00:09.632
(Chattering, woman talking over PA)

00:09.760 --> 00:11.091
(Woman) Silencio.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.960
— (Man) No més.
— ¢No més?

00:13.097 --> 00:16.715
Si, no més. Ya. No me oiste.
Déjame en paz.

00:18.311 --> 00:19.926
Huh.

00:20.897 --> 00:22.478
(Sighs)

00:22.607 --> 00:25.223
(Man) Nurse?
(Woman) Edward Booage?

00:25.359 --> 00:26.895
— (Man) Nurse?
- Right here.

00:27.028 --> 00:29.110
— Come on back, sir.
- Oh, but no. Uh-uh.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.615
Excuse me. I was here before him.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.982
— You need to wait your turn, sir.
— It was my turn.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.616
— (Edward) Easy, bro.
— Go ahead.

00:41.834 --> 00:45.827
One or two ERs in the whole damn city.
What you gonna do, huh?

00:45.963 --> 00:47.419
Verdad.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.460
Yeah. Verdad.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.800
(Woman over P.A.)
Dr. Wasserman, call your service.

00:52.929 --> 00:55.466
Dr. Wasserman,
call your service.

00:57.350 --> 00:59.807
J‘ I went down

00:59.936 --> 01:01.892
J‘ To Touro

01:02.021 --> 01:04.854
J‘ Infirmary

01:04.982 --> 01:06.017
(Man) Nurse?

01:06.150 --> 01:08.812
J‘ My baby

01:08.945 --> 01:10.856
J‘ Left me there

01:10.988 --> 01:13.570
J‘ Da—da ba—boom

01:13.699 --> 01:15.735
J‘ My hair's gone gray

01:15.868 --> 01:19.406
- J‘ Waitin' on this doctor
— (Woman speaking over PA)

01:20.957 --> 01:23.073
J‘ Sittin' in this

01:23.209 --> 01:26.417
J‘ Stone—hard chair...

01:26.545 --> 01:29.457
(Laughs) Right?

01:29.590 --> 01:33.549
J‘ Now if I die, that's if I die

01:33.678 --> 01:35.634
J‘ Please bury me

01:36.806 --> 01:40.014
J‘ With my mouthpiece

01:40.142 --> 01:41.803
J‘ And my 'bone

01:41.936 --> 01:44.097
J‘ Bo b—b—b—bone

01:45.356 --> 01:49.770
J‘ As l have roamed this whole wide world over

J‘ But New Orleans

01:53.656 --> 01:57.194
(Others joining in) J‘ ls still my home J‘

01:57.326 --> 01:58.941
Yeah!

03:32.588 --> 03:34.704
I know all about the wind—storm deductible.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.957
What I'm talking about is right and wrong.

03:38.094 --> 03:41.336
Now, I've been making premium payments
to you people

03:41.472 --> 03:44.179
- for 34 years.
— And we appreciate your loyalty.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.640
And we're honoring the terms
of our agreement with you.

03:46.769 --> 03:48.179
The hell you are.

03:48.312 --> 03:51.554
We determined the primary damage
to your home was caused by the flood.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.818
Well, the hurricane
caused the goddamn flood.

03:54.944 --> 03:57.310
There are varying opinions as to that,
I'm afraid,

03:57.446 --> 03:59.732
which would be moot
if you'd had flood insurance.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.607
So you're telling me
if I had flood insurance, I'd be covered.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.325
But because I didn't, you ain't responsible.

04:06.789 --> 04:09.656
I assume you read your policy carefully
before you signed it.

04:09.792 --> 04:12.078
— (Woman) State Farm. May | help you?
- (Sighs)

04:12.211 --> 04:15.419
I know you must be disappointed.
I'm disappointed for you.

04:15.548 --> 04:17.960
But the policy we have with you...

04:18.092 --> 04:20.299
is clear.

04:24.849 --> 04:26.965
How you get to sleep at night, man?

04:27.893 --> 04:29.269
| drink.

04:29.395 --> 04:33.183
(Woman) I did give him the message
and I'm sure he'll be calling.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.647
(J‘ Singing in Spanish)

04:35.776 --> 04:39.564
(Woman over PA)
Dr. Lorenzo, line four. Dr. Lorenzo, line four.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.901
(Woman) Antoine Batiste?

04:47.037 --> 04:48.993
Thank you, Jesus.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.660
Adiés, amigo.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.748
We can take my ride, brother.

04:53.878 --> 04:55.743
Houston?

04:55.880 --> 04:57.745
Man, I don't know.

04:57.882 --> 05:00.999
Rusty's, baby.
Sunday nights are all about New Orleans.

05:01.135 --> 05:04.127
lt's Glen David Andrews
and most of New Birth representin', man.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.254
But it's really like
an open—mic kind of thing.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.551
So we get to sit in, share some of the door.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.892
— You know how it goes.
— What about Annie?

05:12.021 --> 05:15.889
Little shitbox I'm driving, man,
we can barely hold us three and our gear.

05:16.025 --> 05:19.358
I don't know. We're usually down here
on Frenchmen on Sunday nights.

05:19.487 --> 05:22.194
You'd rather be shucking and jiving
in front of the Apple Barrel

05:22.323 --> 05:24.564
for spare change than throwing it down

05:24.700 --> 05:27.567
at a packed—to—the—rafters
Texas honky—tonk?

05:27.703 --> 05:30.570
It's gonna be a road trip.
An American road trip.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.662
You ever been on one of those?

05:32.791 --> 05:35.578
| read On The Road. In English.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.212
- I dug it.
— You read the book.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.794
Now live the movie, baby.

05:38.923 --> 05:42.086
It's a big fucking country, man.
I mean, Texas itself, shit.

05:42.218 --> 05:45.710
It's not like Holland or Hamsterdam
or wherever the fuck you're from.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.087
It's Amsterdam and it's in Holland.

05:48.224 --> 05:50.681
It's the same place.

05:55.231 --> 05:58.018
— Let me talk to Annie.
— There you go.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.563
(Siren)

06:05.616 --> 06:07.732
(Blowing weakly)

06:10.746 --> 06:12.532
(Continues blowing)

06:12.665 --> 06:15.623
(Laughing)

06:21.840 --> 06:23.250
(J‘ Jazz playing)

06:40.776 --> 06:41.982
(Turns down music)

06:42.111 --> 06:44.818
— How's it going?
-Sde

06:44.947 --> 06:46.983
I spent the day at temporary evidence

06:47.116 --> 06:49.323
looking for a trombone of all things.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.942
Complete chaos. Nothing's catalogued.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.445
- Looks like a...
— Like a storm hit it.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.243
(Laughs)

06:56.375 --> 06:58.457
How's it going with you?

07:00.045 --> 07:02.502
You recognize this one?

07:02.631 --> 07:05.668
Sofia glued her first—grade photo to it.

07:05.801 --> 07:08.588
— That was, what? '96?
— Mm—hm.

07:08.721 --> 07:12.305
(Creighton) That's a special holiday
I'll always remember.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.138
Cray, have you been out today?

07:21.275 --> 07:22.435
Er...

07:24.111 --> 07:27.524
You should get dressed, take a walk,
see some folks, huh?

07:27.656 --> 07:29.897
I'm on break till the semester starts, honey.

07:30.034 --> 07:32.400
Can't I just hang out at home?

07:35.372 --> 07:39.331
You know, Cray, you could think
of this downtime as an opportunity.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.623
Weren't you talking
about working on the novel?

07:42.755 --> 07:46.748
I don't know. My fiction seems
a bit inconsequential to me right now.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.876
— We all need to work.
- I am working.

07:50.012 --> 07:52.344
Aren't you gonna help me here?

07:54.183 --> 07:57.391
Whatever. Pass the tinsel.

07:57.519 --> 08:01.307
— Tinsel? What is this, 1956?
—(Laughs)

08:01.440 --> 08:02.896
(J‘ Hip—hop playing)

08:03.025 --> 08:05.016
I say you could change that, Raymond?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.689
Man, it's time for some 093 up in here.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.732
Putting me to sleep
with that Dixieland merde.

08:09.865 --> 08:13.073
Why am | not smelling
onions sautéing happily on the stove?

08:13.202 --> 08:15.284
In fact, why am I not
smelling anything cooking?

08:15.412 --> 08:17.027
Where are my entrees for table six?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.746
— We have no flame.
— (Sighs)

08:19.875 --> 08:22.457
I thought Entergy came
and blew the water out of the line.

08:22.586 --> 08:25.248
They did. They must have blown it
down the street to somebody.

08:25.381 --> 08:27.963
Who called them back out
and they blew it back to me. Fuck me.

08:28.092 --> 08:30.504
When is the city gonna get this fixed?

08:30.636 --> 08:33.469
I got a packed house tonight.
We are fully committed.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.553
The only thing
we can serve right now is colds.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.264
This is not a deli, Jacques.

08:37.393 --> 08:39.475
People come here,
they want cooked cuisine.

08:39.603 --> 08:43.562
Fire up the butane burners
and set up the chafing dishes.

08:45.234 --> 08:48.351
— (Changes radio station)
— My kitchen, my radio, cousin.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.061
(J‘ Jukebox playing)

08:51.198 --> 08:53.610
(Antoine) Ah, you're my lifeline, baby.

08:53.742 --> 08:58.657
J‘ Here's a tooooast

09:02.751 --> 09:07.211
J‘ To the both of you...

09:07.339 --> 09:09.330
(Laughing)

09:19.476 --> 09:20.807
Yeah.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.607
(Hums)

09:32.489 --> 09:35.856
J‘ Please excuse me

09:35.993 --> 09:39.531
J‘ If I seem just a little bit stunned

09:42.458 --> 09:45.165
J‘ But to lose the one you love

09:45.294 --> 09:49.128
J‘ God knows it sure ain't no fun J‘

09:50.299 --> 09:52.164
Just a little overcome.

09:52.301 --> 09:53.757
(Laughs)

09:54.803 --> 09:56.543
On Stax. A B—side, no less.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.672
— Ollie & The Nightingales.
- Mm-hm, that's right.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.550
But Ollie Hoskins
didn't sing the vocals on this one.

10:02.686 --> 10:06.474
This here is Tommy Tate.
Sir Mack Rice brought him in.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.643
— Tommy could do it.
— Oh, yeah.

10:08.776 --> 10:12.485
Mm—hm. Tate was a giant.
But you know what?

10:12.613 --> 10:14.899
Most folks don't even remember his name.

10:15.032 --> 10:19.321
Memphis, New Orleans.
All these deep—fried musicians,

10:19.453 --> 10:21.944
forgotten or about to be.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.698
Cry a river, you feel the need.
Not gonna get you back on your feet.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.541
My mouth is fucked up, LaDonna.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.047
AI Hirt never played the same
after he caught that brick

10:31.173 --> 10:33.004
ridin' with Bacchus back in the day.

10:33.133 --> 10:37.422
Didn't stop him playing the next 30 years,
so that's no excuse.

10:38.931 --> 10:41.673
What did that ER doctor say
when he took out your stitches?

10:41.809 --> 10:43.674
Said I got dental issues.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.644
Then this is one of them bright—side things

10:46.772 --> 10:50.060
'cause you know we got a dentist in the family gonna
charge you next to nothing.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.729
I ain't going all the way to Baton Rouge
to get my teeth fixed.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.238
Larry does good work. More to the point,

10:55.364 --> 10:58.231
it's an opportunity for you to see your sons.

10:58.367 --> 11:02.406
You can't work right now anyway,
so you got no excuse this time.

11:02.538 --> 11:05.746
I'm ass—broke and empty—handed.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.661
I mean, I should put some gifts
under their tree.

11:08.794 --> 11:11.160
I'll give you a little something for presents.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.548
The Swift Bus is free, so that ain't no thing.

11:19.513 --> 11:23.301
- Yeah, OK.
— All right, then.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.977
(Delmond) Don't just throw
any old name out there, either.

11:29.106 --> 11:32.940
— It must be somebody you really want.
- (Jill) Well, who are your three?

11:33.068 --> 11:34.604
- Beyonce...
— Oh, my God.

11:34.736 --> 11:38.649
Gabrielle Union, and Janet.
I...| couldn't pass up Janet.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.273
You are so shallow.

11:41.410 --> 11:45.278
— I'm not about the pretty boys.
— Oh, yeah? Who would you pick?

11:45.414 --> 11:48.702
— Bernie Williams.
— An athlete. Oh, yeah, you deep.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.324
Have you seen him in an interview?

11:50.460 --> 11:53.042
He is smart, he is sensitive
and he plays guitar.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.628
And you got a thing for musicians.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.214
Let's see. Mm.

11:58.343 --> 12:01.085
Tarell Alvin McCraney.
He will have to be on the list.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.597
Who?

12:02.723 --> 12:05.305
Brilliant, brilliant young brother. Playwright.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.516
We were in drama school together.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.056
He's gay, but I don't care. He's on the list.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.895
The game works better
if you use people I heard of.

12:13.025 --> 12:15.562
And why you wasted a pick on a gay dude,

12:15.694 --> 12:17.980
— I really don't know.
- Whatever.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.944
Who's number three?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.734
McCoy Tyner.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.367
I love that man's music
as much as anyone alive,

12:25.495 --> 12:29.113
but you just wasted your last pick
on a 70—year—old jazzman.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.750
— Jazz legend!
— He's 70!

12:30.876 --> 12:34.494
And you do not seem to understand that
the age thing works differently for women.

12:34.630 --> 12:40.671
We are about the mind. And in McCoy Tyner's case, his
very powerful left hand.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.838
Oh, God!

12:42.971 --> 12:45.257
What is this game called again?

12:45.390 --> 12:47.346
Monogamy With Exceptions.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.512
You spot anybody on the shortlist,

12:49.645 --> 12:51.510
you get a free pass to make a move.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.308
And how are you gonna play the game

12:53.440 --> 12:55.522
when you're not monogamous
in the first place?

12:55.651 --> 12:58.859
You're not trying to claim that I'm the only girl you're seeing,
are you?

12:58.987 --> 13:00.568
(Laughs)

13:00.697 --> 13:03.029
Yeah, I didn't think so.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.069
Well...

13:05.202 --> 13:08.490
OK, then. Monogamy With Exceptions.

13:08.622 --> 13:12.035
Maybe when we cross the river tonight, Beyoncé will be
there waiting for you.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.533
It could happen. New York is like that.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.581
(Train passing)

13:21.176 --> 13:23.508
- 70.
— All right.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.676
I'm guessing that wasn't a raise.

13:28.809 --> 13:32.597
Severance pay.
A day's pay for half a day's work.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.064
Boy even wears his pants
high up on his waist.

13:38.193 --> 13:41.936
— He just can't keep up with me, is all.
—(Laughs)

13:42.072 --> 13:46.065
Yeah, you're like a bull on two legs, son.
Ain't many can keep up with you.

13:46.201 --> 13:49.910
Don't get me wrong. Boy got a good back.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.074
He just don't like to tax it, is all.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.913
(Albert) Yeah, well, he'll learn.

13:54.042 --> 13:57.079
If he want to eat, he gonna learn.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.748
(J‘ Funk on radio)

14:08.682 --> 14:11.799
(Singing along)
J‘ Hoodood hoodood hoodood

14:11.935 --> 14:14.597
J‘ She's burning candles on me J‘

14:15.564 --> 14:17.350
(Humming)

14:17.482 --> 14:19.143
(Crashing)

14:20.736 --> 14:23.853
Oh, fuck!

14:27.409 --> 14:28.865
Fuck!

14:30.579 --> 14:33.366
Cave of Mystery?

14:33.498 --> 14:36.911
Cocksuck, motherfuck!

14:40.922 --> 14:42.787
Did you see that?

14:42.924 --> 14:44.334
You are a witness, sir!

14:44.468 --> 14:48.131
Four months later, half the traffic lights
in this town still don't work.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.504
I ain't seen one of these potholes
getting patched.

14:50.640 --> 14:55.430
The goddamn city!
God damn motherless cunt Katrina!

14:55.562 --> 14:56.768
Fuck!

14:56.897 --> 15:00.310
Well, that particular hole right there
wasn't the fault of the storm directly.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.522
What do you mean?

15:01.651 --> 15:04.393
Utility folks been making what they call "service cuts"

15:04.529 --> 15:07.737
— then filling the holes with gravel.
- Gravel?

15:07.866 --> 15:10.903
That's worthless. The...

15:11.036 --> 15:13.823
Oh, God. I got an appointment
I got to get to, man.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.662
Well, my nephew could give you
a ride to where you're going,

15:16.792 --> 15:18.999
for a small trip charge, of course.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.209
(Sighs) All right.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.750
Just call him.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.372
— Fuck!
— (Dialing)

15:25.509 --> 15:27.591
Where you goin', anyway?

15:27.719 --> 15:30.756
- East Bank.
— East Bank's extra.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.672
Hey, Charles?

15:33.809 --> 15:36.346
Yeah, we got another one
need to cross the bridge.

15:36.478 --> 15:37.968
All right.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.687
No, young man,
you'll not be able to take that.

15:40.816 --> 15:43.774
— What do you mean?
— Charles is on a bike.

15:43.902 --> 15:47.861
— You know, motorcycle.
— Well, what about my shit?

15:47.989 --> 15:51.026
— I'll watch it for you.
— How much?

15:51.159 --> 15:53.571
No, consider it Iagniappe.

15:53.703 --> 15:56.615
All right. Thanks, man.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.713
What's happening, baby?
Where you headed?

16:10.846 --> 16:13.053
Swift Bus to Baton Rouge,
Canal Street stop.

16:13.181 --> 16:16.093
Swift Bus stop? That's at the train station.

16:16.226 --> 16:19.764
The closest one, man.
Take the I—10, no surface streets.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.103
You don't know who you dealin' with, no?

16:22.232 --> 16:24.598
(Indistinct talk over radio)

16:24.734 --> 16:27.567
To every person
who has served and sacrificed

16:27.696 --> 16:32.235
in this emergency,
I offer the gratitude of our country.

16:32.367 --> 16:35.450
And tonight, I als...also offer this pledge

16:35.579 --> 16:37.444
of the American people.

16:37.581 --> 16:40.243
Throughout the area hit by the hurricane,

16:40.375 --> 16:42.912
— we will do what it takes...
— (Doorbell rings)

16:43.044 --> 16:45.080
..we will stay as long as it takes

16:45.213 --> 16:48.080
to help citizens rebuild their communities

16:48.216 --> 16:51.128
— and their lives.
— (Doorbell rings)

16:51.261 --> 16:54.549
And all who question the future
of the Crescent City need to know,

16:54.681 --> 16:58.219
there is no way to imagine America
without New Orleans.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.559
— And this great city will rise again.
— (Davis) Anybody home?

17:03.398 --> 17:05.184
I'm sorry I'm late.

17:05.317 --> 17:08.935
I bent my wheel rim
in a pothole on the West Bank. No lie.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.732
What in the world
were you doing over there? Sofia?

17:11.865 --> 17:13.947
Your piano teacher's here.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.566
- (Door closes)
— And whose fault was that?

17:16.703 --> 17:20.742
It was Entergy digging holes and filling them back up with
gravel.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.741
Can you believe that? Typical clusterfuck.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.539
It's prett... Excuse my language, darling.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.208
— It's OK. I hear worse every day.
— Mm.

17:29.341 --> 17:32.253
— Maybe you should go practice your...
— Right.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.592
How are you?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.586
Huh? Home for the holidays?

17:36.723 --> 17:39.260
Home for good. No more Baton Rouge.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.677
Rockin' good news.

17:40.810 --> 17:44.928
Hey, Cray, do you think you can
give me a lift back to my car

17:45.065 --> 17:49.058
so I can snag my shit and
then maybe take me back to the Treme?

17:50.070 --> 17:51.480
Sure.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.147
It's just for a day or two, OK?

17:55.283 --> 17:57.194
Aren't we doing OK here?

17:57.327 --> 17:59.739
New Orleans is the place
you wanted to be, right?

17:59.871 --> 18:03.159
This is a chance to get on the bill
with some real players, you know?

18:03.291 --> 18:05.907
Meet some people, maybe play some clubs.

18:06.044 --> 18:08.080
You can't do that here?

18:08.213 --> 18:10.579
Maybe I'll have better luck there.

18:13.301 --> 18:16.008
— You be good.
— You too.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.930
You can work the Square,
but don't get with any piano players.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.800
— It would be like cheating.
—(Laughs)

18:30.277 --> 18:32.393
(Davis) Oh, no, no, no.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.520
Fuck,no!

18:34.656 --> 18:37.819
You didn't leave anything
of actual value in that car, did you?

18:39.577 --> 18:41.078
(Sighs)

18:42.872 --> 18:44.703
God!

18:46.376 --> 18:49.118
He said he was gonna watch my shit.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.166
Lagniappe. Lagniappe, my ass!

18:53.633 --> 18:56.591
Even Iagniappe isn't worth
what it used to be.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.049
(Grunts)

19:15.196 --> 19:16.356
Merde.

19:17.532 --> 19:20.365
Fuck me! Fuck me.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.233
Should I call Entergy again?

19:22.370 --> 19:24.827
They're not gonna get back out today.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.868
Yeah, call 'em, but we're fucked.

19:28.543 --> 19:31.626
Tell Louise to call
the reservations and cancel.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.962
I'm gonna go get drunk.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.091
(J‘ Tambourines, men chanting)

19:57.197 --> 20:01.190
(J‘ Singing in call and response)

20:08.958 --> 20:11.495
J‘ Told my mama, told my wife

20:11.628 --> 20:13.289
(J‘ Men chant response)

20:13.421 --> 20:17.630
(J‘ Singing continues, indistinct)

20:17.759 --> 20:19.875
J‘ Lord have mercy on my soul

20:23.973 --> 20:26.635
J‘ Baaoooo! J‘

20:26.768 --> 20:28.599
(J‘ Continues shouting song)

20:44.035 --> 20:46.276
(J‘ Music playing)

20:53.044 --> 20:54.659
(J‘ Man singing)

20:58.883 --> 21:00.999
Show the saxes how we do it!

21:01.136 --> 21:03.969
Lone Star, Shiner
and whiskey, rocks, please.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.633
(Man) Whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:07.600 --> 21:08.510
You want something?

21:08.643 --> 21:11.510
— Oh, big man, I see you.
- So?

21:11.646 --> 21:13.807
You know the cover's five.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.816
(Muttering)

21:26.077 --> 21:27.783
(Laughs)

21:27.912 --> 21:30.619
Shit, man, it's like watching
a rat back up a cat.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.739
(Laughing)

21:37.338 --> 21:40.205
Oh, you motherfuckers.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.380
(Clears throat)

21:50.685 --> 21:52.550
Hello, YouTube?

21:52.687 --> 21:55.269
This is Creighton Bernette
from New Orleans.

21:55.398 --> 21:57.559
Yeah, we're still here.

21:57.692 --> 22:00.559
I just want to say something
to all y'all trying to figure out

22:00.695 --> 22:02.856
what to do about our city.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.570
Blow me.

22:04.699 --> 22:08.112
You say, "Why rebuild it?" I say, "Fuck you."

22:08.244 --> 22:10.735
You rebuilt Chicago after the fire.

22:10.872 --> 22:13.989
You rebuilt San Francisco
after the earthquake.

22:14.125 --> 22:18.664
Let me tell you something.
Anything that's any fucking good in Chicago

22:18.796 --> 22:20.752
came from someplace else.

22:20.882 --> 22:24.374
And San Francisco
is an overpriced cesspool with hills.

22:28.056 --> 22:30.593
To Houston and Atlanta,

22:30.725 --> 22:32.807
may I say,

22:32.936 --> 22:35.097
"Lick my hairy balls."

22:35.230 --> 22:40.395
You took in thousands of our people,
but guess what? You still suck.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.939
We got more culture
in one neighborhood than you got

22:43.071 --> 22:47.280
in all your sorry—ass sprawling suburbs
put together.

22:47.408 --> 22:50.366
To New York, fuck you too.

22:50.495 --> 22:54.704
You get attacked by a few fundamentalist fucking assholes

22:54.832 --> 22:59.041
and the federal money
comes raining down like rose petals.

22:59.170 --> 23:02.788
Our whole fucking coast was destroyed

23:02.924 --> 23:06.837
and we're still waiting for somebody
to give a good goddamn.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.471
But you want to write off New Orleans,

23:11.599 --> 23:12.975
cancel Carnival.

23:13.101 --> 23:17.310
Let me tell you something.
Tuesday, February 28th,

23:17.438 --> 23:19.815
wherever the fuck you all are,

23:19.941 --> 23:23.775
will bejust another gray, dreary,

23:23.903 --> 23:27.316
sorry—ass fucked—up Tuesday.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.359
But down here,

23:29.492 --> 23:31.153
there'll be Mardi Gras.

23:31.286 --> 23:35.325
Fuck you, you fucking fucks!

23:38.960 --> 23:40.825
(Clicks button)

23:40.962 --> 23:43.578
(J‘ Band playing)

23:43.715 --> 23:45.626
(J‘ Indistinct singing)

23:48.595 --> 23:49.630
(Song ends)

23:49.762 --> 23:51.423
(Cheering)

23:55.560 --> 23:57.926
— What's up?
— We're from New Orleans, man.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.178
Sure, come on up here, play one with us.

24:00.315 --> 24:02.806
Come on, man.
Go To The Mardi Gras, right?

24:02.942 --> 24:04.773
— Right. B flat. Igotcha.
— All right.

24:05.820 --> 24:09.062
Ladies and gentlemen, a real hot piano player from
Frenchmen Street,

24:09.198 --> 24:11.689
— Mr. Sonny...
— Shiller. Sonny Shiller.

24:11.826 --> 24:14.659
Sonny the chiller, y'all!
How about a big hand for him?

24:19.167 --> 24:20.953
(Cheering, applause)

24:21.085 --> 24:22.541
(J‘ Hornsjoin in)

24:42.315 --> 24:45.523
J‘ Oh, yes, I'm going to New Orleans

24:45.652 --> 24:48.189
J‘ And I'm gonna see that Mardi Gras

24:50.823 --> 24:53.235
J‘ Say, I'm going down to New Orleans

24:53.368 --> 24:56.576
J‘ And I'm gonna see that Mardi Gras

24:58.873 --> 25:01.535
J‘ And when I get down there

25:01.668 --> 25:04.956
J‘ I'm gonna see that Carnival J‘

25:08.299 --> 25:09.880
Good to have practice, man.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.216
I appreciate you doing this with us.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.882
— (Knock at door)
— Just don't tell Monk on me.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.800
(Laughing)

25:16.933 --> 25:18.798
Ma'am.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.928
I heard you were in here.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.804
I wasn't doing nothing wrong.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.899
You just can't leave my house
and not say where you goin'.

25:28.027 --> 25:31.269
- I'm responsible for you.
— We was just practicing is all.

25:33.825 --> 25:35.941
He wasn't drinking, was he?

25:36.077 --> 25:39.160
Even if he had a mind to,
I wouldn't let him, ma'am.

25:42.583 --> 25:46.075
— It's Lula, remember?
— Yes, ma'am.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.249
— Mr. Lambreaux.
- Albert.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.798
Would you care to join us
for dinner tomorrow?

25:52.927 --> 25:56.090
— Nothing elaborate.
- Delighted.

25:58.433 --> 26:01.095
(All cheering)

26:02.603 --> 26:05.936
Ladies and gentlemen,
how about a big hand for Mr. John Boutté?

26:06.065 --> 26:07.726
(Cheering)

26:09.694 --> 26:11.855
Come on. Join us up here, baby.

26:13.948 --> 26:16.815
And my good friend over there,

26:16.951 --> 26:19.158
ladies and gentlemen, on the piano.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.322
(Cheering)

26:22.540 --> 26:25.998
Yo, Glen, I can carry this for you.

26:26.127 --> 26:27.992
Sorry, man,
we gotta spread it around.

26:28.129 --> 26:31.166
We got a lot of New Orleans cats tonight.
But thank you.

26:31.299 --> 26:32.709
Thank you.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.010
— The high F key sticks a bit.
- Oh, man, thank you.

26:38.139 --> 26:40.425
Hey, by the way,
you did great on the Fess, Max.

26:40.558 --> 26:41.638
- Sonny.
— Oh, I'm Joe.

26:41.768 --> 26:42.678
I know.

26:42.810 --> 26:45.187

-Bﬂa.

26:45.313 --> 26:47.679
Put it in B flat for John, y'all. B flat.

26:53.738 --> 26:55.023
(Man) Good job up there, dawg.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.647
(J‘ Horns playing)

27:00.411 --> 27:03.869
J‘ Don't waste your time

27:14.967 --> 27:18.209
J‘ If you feel your time

27:18.346 --> 27:22.089

27:22.225 --> 27:24.261
J‘ Wasted here

27:25.853 --> 27:30.347
J‘ For a while

27:30.483 --> 27:34.396

J‘ Does your father lie there?

28:34.463 --> 28:37.079
J‘ And the streetcar has seen its day

28:37.216 --> 28:39.172
J‘ When all is gone

28:39.302 --> 28:41.293
J‘ The plantations, the Treme

28:41.429 --> 28:43.044
J‘ And the Vieux Carré

28:43.180 --> 28:46.308
J‘ I'll be swinging to the music

28:46.434 --> 28:48.800
J‘ Way up on higher ground

28:48.936 --> 28:51.973
J‘ Where Pops is blowin' Walk On

28:52.106 --> 28:54.142
J‘ With Gabriel makin' sacred sounds

28:54.275 --> 28:57.733
J‘ I'll see you there
J‘ At the foot of Canal Street

28:57.862 --> 28:59.978
J‘ What will they wear?
J‘ At the foot of Canal Street

29:00.114 --> 29:03.402
J‘ Will the band be playin'?
J‘ At the foot of Canal Street

29:03.534 --> 29:06.697
J‘ What will the people be saying?
J‘ At the foot of Canal Street

29:06.829 --> 29:09.946
J‘ Does your father lie there?

29:10.082 --> 29:13.324
J‘ Does your mother pray there?

29:13.461 --> 29:15.998
J‘ I'm gonna lay my burdens down

29:16.130 --> 29:18.587
J‘ At the foot of Canal J‘

29:33.105 --> 29:34.356
(Girl) Get the fuck off me.

29:34.482 --> 29:37.019
Is there a problem here?
Is there a problem?

29:37.151 --> 29:39.358
Get the fuck...get the fuck out!

29:39.487 --> 29:41.318
Get out!

29:43.991 --> 29:46.858
Texican don't look like much,
but you don't want to fuck with him.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.030
Smallest bouncer I've ever seen.

29:49.163 --> 29:51.870
I thought everything was bigger in Texas.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.991
Don't fuck with that Texican, for real.

29:56.837 --> 29:59.044
Say, man, you up?

30:01.050 --> 30:03.336
You holding?

30:03.469 --> 30:06.211
Heard it was bone dry in New Orleans.

30:23.906 --> 30:28.445
J‘ Take back all the gifts you've been given

30:29.662 --> 30:34.406
J‘ Put a ring and lock of your hair

30:34.542 --> 30:39.457
J‘ And a card with your picture upon it

30:40.548 --> 30:45.884
J‘ It's a face that is false but is fair

30:46.012 --> 30:51.257
(All) J‘ I will pawn me
my gold watch and chain, love

30:51.392 --> 30:57.479
J‘ I will pawn me my gold diamond ring J‘

30:57.606 --> 31:00.018
— To Mayor Nagin.
— (Crowd) No.

31:00.151 --> 31:02.437
— To the city council.
— No! Boo!

31:02.570 --> 31:04.526
— Army Corps of Engineers?
- Boo! No!

31:04.655 --> 31:06.646
- FEMA.
— Oh! No!

31:06.782 --> 31:10.570
— And Entergy!
- Ohhh!

31:12.788 --> 31:15.404
Is anyone in charge? Seriously.

31:15.541 --> 31:19.079
Where are the men of vision? I ask you.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.497
Men of sensitivity,

31:21.630 --> 31:24.246
of intellect...

31:24.383 --> 31:27.125
With the hands of an artist?

31:27.261 --> 31:30.674
Stop, OK? I have kitchen funk on me.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.548
— All you need's a shower.
- Yeah, I like mine warm.

31:33.684 --> 31:35.424
A bath, then.

31:35.561 --> 31:40.351
I'll warm the water on my stove
and pour it over you dutifully.

31:40.483 --> 31:41.723
—(Laughs)
— Real...

31:41.859 --> 31:44.066
19th—century romantic stuff.

31:44.195 --> 31:45.435
Right? Come on.

31:45.571 --> 31:48.108
Can I get a glass of red wine, please, to go?

31:49.700 --> 31:51.281
And what say you, my lady?

31:51.410 --> 31:55.369
Do you think we could use
a change in the civic leadership

31:55.498 --> 31:57.284
of this sad, squalid town?

31:57.416 --> 32:00.328
(Laughs) I don't follow politics.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.621
Thanks.

32:04.757 --> 32:05.917
Cheers.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.458
Cheers.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.307
— So what do you think?
— I think it's late.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.846
— I need to go.
— OK, let's go.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.721
We could walk.
Or would you rather grab a cab?

32:21.857 --> 32:25.020
It's safe, though. Save for the son of a bitch who snagged
my keyboards,

32:25.152 --> 32:27.359
— all the thugs are still in Houston.
- My house.

32:27.488 --> 32:29.024
— OK.
— Alone.

32:29.156 --> 32:30.692
But I thought we...

32:30.825 --> 32:33.362
— I work 16 hours a day.
— What?

32:33.494 --> 32:36.201
My house is a wreck
and if I had the money to fix it,

32:36.330 --> 32:39.493
I'd throw that into the restaurant too,
like every other penny I've ever had.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.037
And for what? The city'll never be the same.

32:42.169 --> 32:46.503
My restaurant's on the rocks,
I got no life here, no family.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.588
And for a private life I have you.

32:48.717 --> 32:51.174
I mean, what am I doing?

32:54.014 --> 32:55.879
Bye, Davis.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.552
Cheers.

32:57.685 --> 33:01.678
(Man) The one that got away.

33:04.024 --> 33:07.107
Mood swings. Man.

33:07.236 --> 33:10.694
If the old guard don't change
then we need to change it.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.404
- Yeah.
— Word.

33:12.533 --> 33:14.398
You should step your shit in there, McAlary.

33:14.535 --> 33:16.901
City Council could use some new fire.

33:17.037 --> 33:19.870
I could run this motherfucker, man. I could.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.910
The only thing you're running is your mouth.

33:22.042 --> 33:24.579
— Yeah, you're right.
— (Man) Mm—hm.

33:24.712 --> 33:27.545
But we do need to clean house,
though. Huh?

33:27.673 --> 33:29.038
- Right?
— (Man) Yeah!

33:29.175 --> 33:31.507
- Right? Right?
— (Murmurs of agreement)

33:31.635 --> 33:33.091
Doh!

33:34.180 --> 33:36.922
J‘ City Council, District C

33:37.057 --> 33:39.048
J‘ DJ Davis, vote for me!

33:39.185 --> 33:40.766
Rhyme that shit, Davis.

33:40.895 --> 33:43.602
J‘ Desperate times need desperate plans

33:43.731 --> 33:45.437
J‘ Y'all know I'm a desperate man J‘

33:45.566 --> 33:47.807
- (All) Whoo, yeah!
— We'd be desperate to vote for you.

33:47.943 --> 33:49.899
Wait, wait! Check this out!

33:50.029 --> 33:52.486
First thing we do, legalize pot.

33:52.615 --> 33:54.526
Use the revenue, fix our streets.

33:54.658 --> 33:56.239
Noblest of goals.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.778
I call my plan

33:57.912 --> 34:00.028
Pot for Potholes!

34:00.164 --> 34:01.700
— (All) Yeah!
— What! What!

34:01.832 --> 34:03.914
- Pot for Potholes.
— Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.079
Right? Pen! I need a pen.

34:06.212 --> 34:09.124
(Man) He's gonna write that shit down.

34:09.256 --> 34:11.121
Look.

34:11.258 --> 34:12.919
(J‘ Band continues playing)

34:17.348 --> 34:19.509
Hey, you were playing the piano earlier, right?

34:19.642 --> 34:22.258
— Mr. Bouncer.
— The music's fucking great.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.134
— It's New Orleans.
— From there, huh?

34:24.271 --> 34:26.136
Amsterdam.

34:26.273 --> 34:29.686
But I got to New Orleans
fast as I fucking could.

34:29.818 --> 34:33.026
- Must be something, huh?
— Never been? Where you from?

34:33.155 --> 34:36.067
A little town southwest of Houston.
Victoria, Texas.

34:36.200 --> 34:39.408
I came all the way from Europe and you couldn't drive five
hours of interstate?

34:39.536 --> 34:41.572
What the fuck is that?

34:41.705 --> 34:43.696
You only live once, Mr. Bouncer.

34:43.832 --> 34:46.824
Then you're dead and gone
for a long fucking time.

34:46.961 --> 34:49.327
You heard me?

35:29.044 --> 35:31.706
(J‘ Drumbeat continues, muted)

35:44.101 --> 35:47.343
(Man speaking over headphones)

35:58.532 --> 36:00.193
(Indistinct greeting)

36:05.372 --> 36:08.114
(Delmond) I don't know, man.
I got a gig at the Vanguard in a couple days.

36:08.250 --> 36:11.708
But this thing is hot right now.
Do the Vanguard and then hit the road.

36:11.837 --> 36:15.250
Come on, Jim,
jazz ain't run hot or cold since bebop.

36:15.382 --> 36:18.169
- Itjust is, man.
— I mean New Orleans.

36:18.302 --> 36:20.543
The storm. Everybody wants a taste.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.965
People know Terence Blanchard,
Wynton Marsalis.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.589
Christian Scott's making a name for himself.

36:25.726 --> 36:28.092
And now here comes Delmond Lambreaux,

36:28.228 --> 36:31.061
another great trumpet player
straight out of New Orleans.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.351
I'm from New Orleans
but I don't play New Orleans.

36:33.484 --> 36:36.942
And neither do those guys. That's why
they made names for themselves.

36:37.071 --> 36:39.858
The acts on that bill, they're New Orleans, they're in that
pocket

36:39.990 --> 36:42.402
Donald Harrison is straight—up modern jazz.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.617
And he's on the bill. He even told the label
he'll share the stage with you.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.282
You and Donald will headline this.

36:47.414 --> 36:50.201
You start out in Portland, Oregon,
work down the coast to LA,

36:50.334 --> 36:52.996
Phoenix, Houston, end in New Orleans.

36:53.128 --> 36:54.789
Big homecoming show.

36:54.922 --> 36:56.583
(Sighs)

36:57.591 --> 37:01.049
Portland, Oregon?
I played Portland before. Nice folks.

37:01.178 --> 37:03.635
But you know
they clap on the one and three?

37:06.141 --> 37:07.881
Open.

37:08.018 --> 37:10.885
Ahh. Ahh!

37:11.021 --> 37:13.512
LaDonna will be here on Christmas Eve.

37:13.649 --> 37:17.016
— You stayin'?
— (Mumbled) I'm goin' back, me.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.313
— I got Desiree and the baby.
- Yeah.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.152
Been by the bar?

37:21.281 --> 37:24.318
— Yeah.
— How's it doin'?

37:24.451 --> 37:26.157
All right, I guess.

37:26.286 --> 37:29.153
Well, she's not one
to share the financial details.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.075
- (Chuckles)
— I'm sure if she needed help,

37:31.208 --> 37:32.698
— she wouldn't ask for it.
- Mm-hm.

37:32.835 --> 37:36.419
— The woman's proud like that.
— Don't I know?

37:36.547 --> 37:39.880
Once I get these impressions,
I'll make you a permanent bridge.

37:40.008 --> 37:42.499
In the meantime,
you'll walk out with a temporary.

37:42.636 --> 37:44.422
Should be able to play behind it.

37:44.555 --> 37:47.342
Oh, man, I do need to work.

37:47.474 --> 37:49.385
The boys look good.

37:49.518 --> 37:51.179
Ah, they're pleased to see you.

37:51.311 --> 37:53.643
You done a good job with them, man.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.559
I appreciate you putting me up here

37:56.692 --> 37:58.899
and, you know, all this.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.689
— It's not a problem.
- (Chair whirring)

38:01.822 --> 38:05.360
I want you to breathe through your nose,
relax your lower jaw.

38:05.492 --> 38:07.278
This is gonna taste a little funny.

38:07.411 --> 38:09.652
— Ahh.
— Relax.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.200
— (Police radio)
— (Lafouchette) Prints came back.

38:12.332 --> 38:16.200
The man wearing David Maurice Brooks' bracelet is not
David Maurice Brooks.

38:16.336 --> 38:18.327
That we know. So who is he?

38:20.007 --> 38:21.622
Keevon White.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.670
Time at Angola on assault and gun charges,

38:24.803 --> 38:26.839
currently awaiting trial on a murder,

38:26.972 --> 38:30.055
suspect in another but the witness recanted.

38:30.184 --> 38:32.926
Jesus. How'd he come
to be wearing my kid's bracelet?

38:33.061 --> 38:34.847
Hate to think.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.063
Look,TonL

38:38.192 --> 38:40.808
we're not even acknowledging
that we ever had David Brooks.

38:40.944 --> 38:43.526
Keevon White arrived
at that backwater parish

38:43.655 --> 38:46.863
wearing a bracelet issued by OPP
in David's name.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.983
How can you say you never had him?

38:49.119 --> 38:53.158
For all we know, this badass
knew David Brooks from grade school,

38:53.290 --> 38:54.996
or dated his cousin,

38:55.125 --> 38:57.332
or just made up the name
when he got booked.

38:57.461 --> 39:01.295
Middle name too?
Just happened to get all three right?

39:02.382 --> 39:04.668
Thanks for finding Keevon White for us.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.257
(Laughs)

39:06.386 --> 39:08.638
I do appreciate it.

39:21.902 --> 39:24.689
Thought I'd give y'all an early taste.

39:28.534 --> 39:32.118
What? You think baseball's
just for white folks?

39:32.246 --> 39:34.612
Randall plays on a travel team.

39:34.748 --> 39:37.410
He's a bit past the Nerf ball thing.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.329
Ah.

39:43.590 --> 39:47.048
— Thanks, Pop.
— I hope that fit.

39:48.178 --> 39:51.011
If it doesn't, maybe you could take it back.

39:54.685 --> 39:56.471
Coming to dinner with us, Larry?

39:56.603 --> 39:58.594
I don't think so.

40:02.359 --> 40:04.816
You doin' fine on your own.

40:06.029 --> 40:08.736
Thanks, man.

40:13.579 --> 40:16.195
I never really play that much Cajun.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.822
I mean, just a little bit on Royal Street.

40:18.959 --> 40:21.666
Well, if it was a real Cajun band,

40:21.795 --> 40:25.162
then they'd have a real Cajun fiddle player,
I'd guarantee.

40:25.299 --> 40:29.008
But they ain't exactly the Balfa Brothers.

40:29.136 --> 40:33.004
— Are you playing?
— No call for a mandolin or a guitar.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.005
I've never done a recording session.

40:35.142 --> 40:37.303
Two years at conservatory.

40:37.436 --> 40:39.017
All classical.

40:39.146 --> 40:43.685
You know, this playing on the street
and club gigs, it's a whole other world.

40:43.817 --> 40:46.479
— How long you been down here?
- A year and a half.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.398
— From where?
- New York.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.395
I came here with my boyfriend.

40:50.532 --> 40:52.648
I met him in Europe backpacking.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.649
He's the one who wanted
to come to New Orleans.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.902
He's been talking about it
since he was a kid

40:57.039 --> 40:59.200
and he heard his first Fats Domino record.

40:59.333 --> 41:01.745
Well, you want us to call these guys?

41:01.877 --> 41:05.165
I mean, you know,
they do need a fiddle for one track.

41:06.548 --> 41:09.290
Coolest thing,
seeing your name on a real CD.

41:09.426 --> 41:12.213
(Chuckles) I'll let you know when I'm ready.

41:12.346 --> 41:16.715
Whoa! You're that guy! Terry, it's that guy!

41:16.850 --> 41:19.592
Oh, yeah. Cool. Excellent stuff, my man.

41:20.437 --> 41:22.849
"Fuck you, you fuckin' fucks!"

41:24.024 --> 41:25.935
Don't leave me hanging.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.775
Your coffee drink is comped on account

41:29.905 --> 41:32.396
of the ovenNhelming righteousness
of your vid rant.

41:32.532 --> 41:35.365
— What are you having?
— Skinny latte.

41:42.584 --> 41:44.791
Hey, give 'em hell, big man!

41:45.629 --> 41:47.290
Fuck,yeah!

41:55.430 --> 41:57.762
(Batiste) OK, which one y'all like?

41:57.891 --> 41:59.973
(Alcide) TGI Friday's is the bomb.

42:00.102 --> 42:02.058
Olive Garden and Coco's is good too.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.678
- Yeah?
— (Randall) We like 'em all, Daddy.

42:04.815 --> 42:06.726
Don't they have these in New Orleans?

42:06.858 --> 42:09.019
Uh, out in Metairie.

42:09.152 --> 42:12.644
But I can't say I've ever had the pleasure.

42:12.781 --> 42:14.521
(Car alarm beeps)

42:14.658 --> 42:17.695
Where'd you get these mirlitons?
I heard they was all washed away.

42:17.828 --> 42:21.696
I lost my vines from the yard,
but they can still be got.

42:22.582 --> 42:25.244
So you must have a place
other than that bar, right?

42:25.377 --> 42:27.618
Brick rancher in Gentilly.

42:27.754 --> 42:30.291
I'm still fighting the insurance on it, though.

42:30.424 --> 42:33.336
Insurance some scheming—ass bitches.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.385
I'm sorry, but they are.

42:38.765 --> 42:41.097
He's not wrong, you know.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.013
(Cell phone buzzing)

42:44.146 --> 42:46.182
Oh, it's my cell phone.

42:46.314 --> 42:48.896
It's still new. I'm not used to it.

42:49.025 --> 42:52.813
It's my daughter from Houston. Excuse me.

42:52.946 --> 42:54.652
Hi, Davina?

42:54.781 --> 42:57.363
How you doin', baby?

42:57.492 --> 43:00.234
I'm good. I'm all right.

43:00.370 --> 43:03.862
Oh, just sitting here with some friends.

43:03.999 --> 43:06.957
Daddy, does our half—sister look like us?

43:07.085 --> 43:09.371
Honorée?

43:09.504 --> 43:13.793
Nah, you know, a little bit.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.041
Got a picture?

43:16.178 --> 43:18.419
I don't carry pictures of none of y'all.

43:18.555 --> 43:21.672
Keep 'em on the dresser.
That way I know where they're at.

43:21.808 --> 43:25.096
Maybe you can bring our new sister
to Baton Rouge for a visit.

43:25.228 --> 43:27.560
Well, you can come to New Orleans.

43:27.689 --> 43:30.351
It's hard for me to get up here, see?

43:30.484 --> 43:33.476
I gotta keep working.
And when you two go to college...

43:33.612 --> 43:36.524
and I said when, not if,

43:36.656 --> 43:38.317
I hope to contribute some.

43:44.664 --> 43:48.873
Now, look,
I know I don't get to see y'all that much.

43:49.002 --> 43:52.119
But, look, even though I don't get to see y'all...

43:53.924 --> 43:56.586
you're always right here all the time.

43:58.136 --> 44:00.627
And lucky for you,
you have a strong woman for a mom,

44:00.764 --> 44:03.927
and Larry, he's a good man,

44:04.059 --> 44:06.675
a good stepfather for y'all.

44:06.812 --> 44:08.348
That's lucky too.

44:09.940 --> 44:11.521
I gotta pee.

44:12.526 --> 44:14.187
Hey.

44:28.124 --> 44:30.581
— Your daughter good?
- Son too.

44:30.710 --> 44:33.201
Got on the call from New York.

44:33.338 --> 44:37.422
About to go on a big tour,
end up here in New Orleans.

44:37.551 --> 44:40.839
Mm, this is some fine bread pudding.

44:40.971 --> 44:43.713
I ain't ate like this since I came back. Mm.

44:45.559 --> 44:50.428
Darius, what you gonna do now
that your haulin' career got cut short?

44:50.564 --> 44:54.273
Look for new work, I guess.
Least till school start back.

44:54.401 --> 44:57.438
There's plenty of work, you really want it.

44:57.571 --> 45:00.233
You look, you'll find it.

45:00.365 --> 45:02.026
How's your business?

45:03.410 --> 45:07.323
People have still got walls and ceilings
needing fixed.

45:07.455 --> 45:11.198
I got a crack in my wall upstairs
needing tending to.

45:11.334 --> 45:14.542
Well, I could maybe
take a look at that for you later.

45:20.468 --> 45:22.959
(Delmond) You say Wynton gonna be here? (Jill) That's
what I heard.

45:23.096 --> 45:25.587
— Who else?
— Lots of people.

45:25.724 --> 45:28.215
Everybody who's anybody.

45:50.457 --> 45:52.573
Hey, sweetie, how you doin'?

45:52.709 --> 45:54.324
— How you doin', Stanley?
— All right.

45:54.461 --> 45:59.501
You know, about that piece
you wrote about 52nd Street. I was, uh...

45:59.633 --> 46:02.090
as they say, pleasantly surprised.

46:02.218 --> 46:04.960
Oh, thank you, Stanley.
I'm gonna go get a glass of wine.

46:05.096 --> 46:07.758
— Then I'll be back for more flattery.
- Oh, you'll get it.

46:07.891 --> 46:10.553
Stanley, you know
my friend Delmond Lambreaux?

46:10.685 --> 46:13.518
— Stanley Crouch.
— Oh, yeah, I know him from his recordings.

46:13.647 --> 46:15.854
— Yeah, OK. Nice to meet you, Stanley.
— Right.

46:15.982 --> 46:18.359
— Uh, I better...
— Jill, so good to see you!

46:18.485 --> 46:21.101
— I think you better get a move on.
— Yeah, nice to meet you.

46:21.237 --> 46:23.273
How they treating you over at
The Village Voice?

46:23.406 --> 46:24.862
Ah, good enough.

46:24.991 --> 46:27.232
Delmond Lambreaux, Nelson George.

46:27.369 --> 46:29.200
Hey, Delmond.
So good of you to come, man.

46:29.329 --> 46:31.194
Thanks for having me. Appreciate it.

46:31.331 --> 46:33.367
Jill, you know
that special treat I promised you?

46:33.500 --> 46:35.991
— I have it right over here.
— Oh, my God.

46:37.170 --> 46:38.785
See y'all later.

46:41.424 --> 46:43.676
Can you believe that? A legend right there.

46:43.802 --> 46:47.590
Mr. Tyner? McCoy Tyner?
This is Jill I spoke to you about.

46:47.722 --> 46:51.465
— Oh, yeah. How are you, Jill?
— It is an absolute honor to meet you, sir.

46:51.601 --> 46:53.387
— I read you in the Voice.
— You did?

46:53.520 --> 46:55.385
— Yeah.
— (Nelson) Sorry, folks.

46:55.522 --> 46:57.888
— I'd like to introduce you to Delmond.
- I am such a big fan.

46:58.024 --> 47:00.401
— What's going on, everybody?
- Cliff Robinson.

47:00.527 --> 47:02.267
— Yeah, big fan, man. Big fan.
- Hi, Delmond.

47:02.404 --> 47:04.611
— Renee Neufville.
- Hi, hi, hi.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.400
I love your work, Renee. Hey.

47:06.533 --> 47:08.114
— Spencer Means.
— All right.

47:08.243 --> 47:10.734
- Kenny Anderson.
— Good to meet you, man. Big fan.

47:10.870 --> 47:12.906
Delmond Lambreaux.

47:13.039 --> 47:15.701
- Thank you very much.
— Would you play for us tonight?

47:15.834 --> 47:18.541
— (Delmond) Not bad at all.
— Maybe a little something.

47:18.670 --> 47:21.161
You happen to have a Yankee outfielder walking around
here?

47:21.297 --> 47:23.162
Bernie Williams is here.
I saw him on the roof

47:23.299 --> 47:25.164
with Spike Lee maybe a half—hour ago.

47:25.301 --> 47:28.213
- You want to meet him?
— Yeah, why not? Why not?

47:28.346 --> 47:29.586
— One second.
- Sure.

47:29.723 --> 47:32.260
Well, if you could...

47:32.392 --> 47:33.928
— Mr. Tyner?
— Yeah.

47:34.060 --> 47:36.096
— Good to see you, Del.
- Good to see you.

47:36.229 --> 47:38.094
— Let me just borrow Jill for a second?
- Sure.

47:38.231 --> 47:39.937
I'll be right back.

47:40.066 --> 47:41.476
You fuckin' set me up.

47:42.402 --> 47:44.609
Oh, look, there's Janet Jackson.

47:44.738 --> 47:46.319
Psych!

47:51.161 --> 47:53.117
— You're real funny.
— You know I am.

47:53.246 --> 47:55.077
Yeah. She's a trip.

47:55.206 --> 47:57.367
Delmond, you've been in New York
a few years now?

47:57.500 --> 47:59.365
Who, me? No, I'm a country boy...

47:59.502 --> 48:01.493
So it seems.

48:03.923 --> 48:07.131
— (Knock at door)
— (Man) Big Chief!

48:07.260 --> 48:09.922
Hey, baby.

48:10.055 --> 48:12.637
Coming to the service this afternoon, right?

48:12.766 --> 48:15.348
Yeah. I got a little job to do this morning.

48:15.477 --> 48:19.436
Then I'm gonna go pick up a suit
down at Dillard's over in Metairie,

48:19.564 --> 48:21.805
come back home, change.

48:21.941 --> 48:24.728
— What brings you by?
— My grandmother.

48:24.861 --> 48:26.897
My father's mother.

48:27.030 --> 48:29.897
- How's she doing?
— She's taking it hard.

48:30.033 --> 48:33.491
Thing is, she don't want a funeral with...

48:33.620 --> 48:36.657
You know she didn't exactly
approve of my dad maskin' Indian.

48:36.790 --> 48:38.621
Never did.

48:40.126 --> 48:42.503
— You sayin' she don't want us there at all?
- No, no.

48:42.629 --> 48:45.792
Understand,
my family wants you there.

48:45.924 --> 48:48.586
You are family to me.

48:48.718 --> 48:50.959
So what is it, then?

48:52.931 --> 48:55.172
She don't want y'all to speak.

48:55.308 --> 48:58.550
No words at the graveside,
no chanting, nothin' like that.

48:58.686 --> 49:00.551
We did our thing last week
in the Lower Nine,

49:00.688 --> 49:02.474
so she ain't got to worry about that.

49:02.607 --> 49:05.599
— I know.
— I did want to say a few words about Jesse.

49:05.735 --> 49:09.523
Not as an Indian, as a man.

49:09.656 --> 49:11.442
I know that.

49:11.574 --> 49:16.910
But see, my grandmother...
for her, it was, I don't know, disreputable.

49:17.038 --> 49:22.283
You his Chief.
You say anything, itjust reminds folks.

49:22.418 --> 49:24.670
I hope you understand.

49:28.675 --> 49:32.133
I will honor your grandmother's wishes.

49:32.262 --> 49:34.548
Thank you.

49:34.681 --> 49:36.546
I'm sorry.

49:36.683 --> 49:39.299
I expect to see you at the next practice.

49:39.435 --> 49:43.348
You are the Wild Man's son
and we need you.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.813
— I'm leaving town after.
- Why?

49:47.193 --> 49:49.024
I got work, you need it.

49:49.154 --> 49:51.691
The house is gone.
Ain't no place to live here.

49:51.823 --> 49:53.814
Least, nothing that I could afford.

49:53.950 --> 49:55.565
I don't know.

49:55.702 --> 49:58.068
I'll see you this afternoon, Chief.

49:58.204 --> 50:00.445
OK, now.

50:03.543 --> 50:06.501
(J‘ Hip—hop playing)

50:35.241 --> 50:38.028
(Toni) Keevon White?

50:38.161 --> 50:40.197
Prints came back. You knew they would.

50:40.330 --> 50:42.195
You could have saved us a trip.

50:42.332 --> 50:44.368
Carryin' a murder charge.

50:44.500 --> 50:47.458
I ain't in no hurry to have my name ring out.

50:47.587 --> 50:50.704
Do you know the current
whereabouts of David Brooks?

50:50.840 --> 50:52.250
Nope.

50:52.383 --> 50:54.419
Well, you're wearing his bracelet.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.668
Maybe we goin' steady.

50:57.847 --> 50:59.508
Look at us.

51:03.770 --> 51:06.102
You look at us, God damn it!

51:07.106 --> 51:08.892
This is my mother...

51:10.443 --> 51:12.399
David's mother.

51:15.657 --> 51:18.069
Help us.

51:24.958 --> 51:26.414
A'ight.

51:26.542 --> 51:30.080
It's hot as hell up on that overpass.

51:30.213 --> 51:33.000
No water for three, four days.

51:33.132 --> 51:37.341
Some drank flood water
if they could scoop it.

51:37.470 --> 51:39.335
That's where you met David?

51:39.472 --> 51:43.966
I noticed him more
like he was soft, shiverin'.

51:44.102 --> 51:45.558
He was sick?

51:46.604 --> 51:50.347
Let's say, it looked like he needed something to make him
feel better.

51:50.483 --> 51:52.519
— I do not believe that.
— I don't either, Mama.

51:52.652 --> 51:54.358
Hm.

51:54.487 --> 51:56.227
Go on.

51:57.407 --> 51:59.363
We didn't actually speak.

51:59.492 --> 52:01.483
But I took note of the boy.

52:01.619 --> 52:04.702
And they put us on them buses
up to the Hunt,

52:04.831 --> 52:06.787
threw us all in the field.

52:06.916 --> 52:10.283
Wasn't no bedrolls or toilets.

52:10.420 --> 52:13.537
Guards would toss sandwiches
over the wire and laugh,

52:13.673 --> 52:16.460
like they were feeding animals at a zoo.

52:16.592 --> 52:19.425
And we fightin' over them sandwiches too,

52:19.554 --> 52:21.636
moldy as they was.

52:21.764 --> 52:24.471
Wasn't nobody protected.

52:24.600 --> 52:27.057
Your brother way too kindhearted.

52:27.186 --> 52:29.518
So I took him up under my wing.

52:29.647 --> 52:32.263
You was just looking out for him, huh?

52:32.400 --> 52:34.231
I told him how it was gonna be.

52:34.360 --> 52:37.147
He needed to give up his bracelet
and wear mine.

52:37.280 --> 52:39.066
And if he did that,

52:39.198 --> 52:41.735
I would be sure that nobody would punk him

52:41.868 --> 52:43.950
or cause him any bodily harm.

52:44.078 --> 52:47.570
That's what happened?
You persuaded David to trade bracelets?

52:47.707 --> 52:49.914
Wasn't about to wear no murder bracelet.

52:50.043 --> 52:53.206
I could wear one
with some bullshit charges on it.

52:53.338 --> 52:55.545
Shit, I thought I might get tip on out of here

52:55.673 --> 52:57.880
if they got to settin' bails again.

52:58.009 --> 53:00.751
And do you know
where they sent him after Hunt?

53:00.887 --> 53:05.347
Last time I seen him, he was steppin'
on the bus to some other damn parish.

53:05.475 --> 53:07.431
I don't know which.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.096
Why would you do this?

53:09.228 --> 53:11.605
Why would you take my boy's name
like that,

53:11.731 --> 53:13.813
cause us all this misery?

53:13.941 --> 53:15.681
Respectfully, ma'am,

53:15.818 --> 53:17.979
I know how to jail.

53:18.112 --> 53:19.693
Your boy don't.

53:24.619 --> 53:27.156
I'd like to, uh, read this back to you

53:27.288 --> 53:29.700
and have you sign it.

53:30.833 --> 53:32.414
We need your statement.

53:33.544 --> 53:35.250
Conversation never happened.

53:36.255 --> 53:39.213
I ain't about to take another charge over this.

53:40.927 --> 53:43.168
But I hope you find your boy, ma'am.

53:46.974 --> 53:50.011
(Laughter and chatter)

53:50.144 --> 53:53.102
I heard you on Royal Street. You can play.

53:53.231 --> 53:54.937
Thank you.

53:55.066 --> 53:57.478
You should come sit in with us.

53:57.610 --> 54:00.602
I shouldn't. Not without Sonny.

54:00.738 --> 54:03.525
Baby, he couldn't carry your bow.

54:08.788 --> 54:11.575
(Priest) We brought nothing into this world

54:11.707 --> 54:15.916
and it is certain
that we can carry nothing out.

54:16.045 --> 54:20.709
The Lord has given
and the Lord has taken away.

54:20.842 --> 54:24.005
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

54:24.137 --> 54:26.298
Blessed are they that dieth in the Lord,

54:26.431 --> 54:28.547
even so sayeth the Spirit,

54:28.683 --> 54:31.595
that they may rest from their labor.

54:31.727 --> 54:35.219
As it has pleased the Almighty God
in His wise providence

54:35.356 --> 54:38.598
to take out of the world the soul of this,
our deceased brother,

54:38.734 --> 54:42.226
we do now therefore
commit his body to the ground,

54:42.363 --> 54:43.864
earth to earth,

54:43.990 --> 54:45.901
ashes to ashes,

54:46.033 --> 54:48.240
and dust to dust.

54:48.369 --> 54:51.486
Looking for the general resurrection
on the last day

54:51.622 --> 54:55.206
and the life of the world to come
through our Lord, Jesus Christ,

54:55.334 --> 54:58.747
at whose second coming in glorious majesty to judge the
world,

54:58.880 --> 55:01.542
the earth and the sea
shall give up their dead.

56:01.025 --> 56:03.311
(J‘ Man singing)

56:11.661 --> 56:14.494
I'll UPS that permanent bridge to you.

56:14.622 --> 56:17.830
You ever have any problems with it,
you call me, you hear?

56:19.585 --> 56:21.576
Come here, boys.

56:25.967 --> 56:27.753
Y'all remember what I told you.

56:27.885 --> 56:31.218
Right here all the time.

56:35.226 --> 56:37.808
Ahhh.

56:45.027 --> 56:46.983
Merry Christmas, baby.

56:47.113 --> 56:49.024
You all too.

57:14.140 --> 57:17.758
Is this a business or pleasure trip for you?

57:17.893 --> 57:20.509
Pleasure.

57:20.646 --> 57:22.682
New Orleans.

57:22.815 --> 57:24.771
Always for pleasure.
