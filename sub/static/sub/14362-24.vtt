[Train bell dinging]

00:07.407 --> 00:09.342
- Welcome to Disney World.
-  Thank you.

00:09.342 --> 00:10.477
- [Chuckles]
- Wait.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.579
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

00:12.579 --> 00:16.350
These tickets are for
Disneyland in California.

00:17.041 --> 00:18.976
Wait. What?

00:18.976 --> 00:20.978
Disneyl-land?

00:20.978 --> 00:22.380
These tickets are for Disneyland?

00:22.380 --> 00:25.182
You're telling me we drove for two days

00:25.182 --> 00:26.451
to the wrong park?

00:26.451 --> 00:27.985
Unbelievable.

00:27.985 --> 00:29.287
- This is not happening!
- I wanted a hat.

00:29.387 --> 00:31.422
Oh, my God. They drove to the wrong park.

00:31.422 --> 00:32.023
It's official.

00:32.023 --> 00:34.425
There's no way I'm genetically
linked to you people!

00:34.425 --> 00:36.027
Can someone please help me?!

00:36.027 --> 00:36.928
Anybody?

00:36.928 --> 00:38.096
I'm looking for my real family!

00:38.096 --> 00:40.398
I don't... I don't know how
this could have happened.

00:40.398 --> 00:41.899
See? "Disneyland".

00:41.899 --> 00:43.768
It's right there on your tickets.

00:43.768 --> 00:45.570
- [Sighs]
- You didn't read the tickets, Frankie?

00:45.570 --> 00:47.004
Yeah, I read the ticket, Mike.

00:47.004 --> 00:48.005
I just thought it would be fun

00:48.005 --> 00:49.874
to drive 900 miles in
the opposite direction.

00:49.874 --> 00:51.010
- [Sighs]
- See...

00:51.011 --> 00:52.709
- [Exhales sharply]
- my daughter won a contest

00:52.710 --> 00:55.246
for two days in the park
and one night in a hotel

00:55.246 --> 00:56.547
and they gave us this form.

00:56.547 --> 00:58.682
And it had a castle on the top.

00:58.682 --> 01:00.951
And, uh... it was an honest mistake.

01:00.951 --> 01:02.320
I didn't have my glasses.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.956
Y-you'll get there... Carol. Trust me.

01:04.956 --> 01:07.891
She's blind 'cause she's old.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.769
What? I'm helping.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.638
- [Sighs]
- I mean, come on, Carol.

01:11.638 --> 01:14.006
This place is all about magic, right?

01:14.006 --> 01:16.142
So, what do you say you just
tinker-bell the situation

01:16.142 --> 01:17.477
and let us in.

01:17.477 --> 01:18.811
- [Laughs]
- Nobody needs to know.

01:18.811 --> 01:20.146
It could just be our little secret.

01:20.146 --> 01:21.748
Uh, but the machine will know

01:21.748 --> 01:23.416
'cause here, we use magic bands.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.485
And when I scan them, they go "beep."

01:25.485 --> 01:28.021
That's okay. See,
because we can just...

01:28.021 --> 01:29.956
We can just put these on our arms.

01:29.956 --> 01:32.192
And then we'll scan them and
we'll make the beep sound.

01:32.192 --> 01:32.756
[Chuckles lightly]

01:32.758 --> 01:35.128
So... so... So you...
you can just swipe it,

01:35.128 --> 01:36.996
and... and we'll all go "beep," right?

01:36.996 --> 01:38.131
Just beep, beep, beep. See?

01:38.131 --> 01:39.632
That's no problem at all. Right, everybody?

01:39.632 --> 01:42.035
All: Beep, beep, beep, beep.

01:42.035 --> 01:42.903
[Static crackles]

01:42.903 --> 01:44.971
Can I get someone from
guest relations, please?

01:45.171 --> 01:47.273
- Quickly.
- All: Beep, beep, beep, beep.

01:48.408 --> 01:49.708
[Sighs]

01:49.708 --> 01:51.310
He's been back there for a long time.

01:51.310 --> 01:52.879
That's not a good sign, is it?

01:52.879 --> 01:54.413
- I don't know.
- [Sighs]

01:54.413 --> 01:55.882
I can't remember what
a good sign looks like.

01:55.882 --> 01:58.917
Dear God, I know you have war and famine

01:58.917 --> 02:00.887
and Justin Bieber's gone off the rails,

02:00.887 --> 02:03.122
but if you could please, please,

02:03.122 --> 02:04.857
please just let us into Disney World...

02:04.857 --> 02:05.859
[Door opens]

02:05.859 --> 02:07.527
Sorry, folks.

02:07.527 --> 02:10.363
We've just never had anyone
go to the wrong park before.

02:10.363 --> 02:13.666
Um, I pulled all the strings I could,

02:13.666 --> 02:15.368
but under the circumstances,

02:15.368 --> 02:17.670
there's just no way we can

02:17.670 --> 02:20.907
not let you have a great time
here at Walt Disney World!

02:20.907 --> 02:21.908
[Cheering]

02:21.908 --> 02:23.543
- Hey!
- [Laughs]

02:23.543 --> 02:26.045
- Ooh, oh.
- [Chuckles]

02:26.045 --> 02:27.180
[Inhales deeply]

02:27.180 --> 02:29.382
We also had a hotel.

02:29.382 --> 02:30.950
- [Chuckles]
- Oh.

02:32.552 --> 02:35.654
Sure. We got a little
later start than we planned,

02:35.654 --> 02:36.356
but we did it.

02:36.356 --> 02:37.223
We made it.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.259
We got our big crisis out of the way,

02:39.259 --> 02:40.360
and the fun starts now.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.495
Oh.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.398
It's more beautiful than I ever imagined.

02:45.398 --> 02:48.001
- [Gasps]
- I've dreamed of this my whole life.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.370
I've seen it on TV a million times,

02:50.370 --> 02:52.071
and now I'm standing right in front of it.

02:52.071 --> 02:53.140
- [Gasps]
- And I

02:53.141 --> 02:54.940
[Inhales deeply]

02:54.941 --> 02:56.543
[Thud]

02:56.543 --> 02:58.912
Okay, so, uh, we hit some rides

02:58.912 --> 03:00.914
and meet back at Sue's body later?

03:00.914 --> 03:02.615
So, listen, we've all talked,

03:02.615 --> 03:04.917
and we've agreed not to
take any extreme measures

03:04.917 --> 03:06.019
to save her life.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.887
I can hear you, Axl.

03:07.887 --> 03:09.222
How you doing, Sue?
Any shortness of breath?

03:09.222 --> 03:10.189
Let me check.

03:10.189 --> 03:12.358
[Breathing rapidly]

03:12.358 --> 03:15.094
Sue, you're not trying to
have shortness of breath.

03:15.094 --> 03:17.463
What? She's fine.

03:17.463 --> 03:18.131
We're gonna be here all day,

03:18.131 --> 03:19.933
and I want to make sure there's
time to get over to Epcot.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.568
He heard they sell beer there.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.069
Excuse me, Kimberly.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.270
Sorry to interrupt,

03:24.270 --> 03:26.472
but I'm looking for a specific kind of hat.

03:26.472 --> 03:27.874
Let me describe it to you.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.776
It's kind of a felty,
black, half-moon shape

03:30.776 --> 03:31.778
with these rounded appendages

03:31.778 --> 03:33.412
that are, I guess you could say, earlike.

03:33.412 --> 03:34.447
She knows the hat, Brick.

03:34.447 --> 03:35.982
They're called Mickey ears.

03:35.982 --> 03:36.983
If you don't mind, dad.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.485
You drove us six states
in the wrong direction,

03:39.485 --> 03:40.954
- and she works here, so...
- [sighs]

03:40.954 --> 03:42.255
I'm familiar with the hat.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.257
Great. Now, this hat...

03:44.257 --> 03:45.992
Would it be available
for purchase in the park?

03:45.992 --> 03:47.427
[Sighs]

03:48.727 --> 03:51.263
Okay. Fun starts now.

03:51.263 --> 03:52.430
I can feel it.

03:52.430 --> 03:53.298
What do you want to do first?

03:53.298 --> 03:53.899
- Everything!
- Epcot.

03:53.899 --> 03:55.068
You guys do whatever you want.

03:55.068 --> 03:55.935
I'm gonna hit some rides.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.436
Then I'll see you at the
hotel after the park closes.

03:57.436 --> 03:59.705
Oh, and if you see a long,
white glove on the door,

03:59.705 --> 04:01.841
it means I'm entertaining
a princess, in which case,

04:01.841 --> 04:03.676
you should just crash on
the couches in the lobby.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.044
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:05.044 --> 04:06.879
No one's entertaining any princesses,

04:06.879 --> 04:08.214
and no one is splitting up.

04:08.214 --> 04:09.582
This is a family vacation.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.118
We're gonna enjoy it together as a family.

04:12.118 --> 04:13.653
All right. Sue, navigate.

04:13.653 --> 04:16.189
Okay. Right now, the best
ride is Jungle Cruise,

04:16.189 --> 04:17.555
and, according to Brad,

04:17.555 --> 04:19.125
we should try to get on Randy's Boat

04:19.125 --> 04:21.392
- because he is a-mazing.
- [Laughs]

04:21.392 --> 04:23.295
- Sounds like a plan.
- Whoo-hoo!

04:25.031 --> 04:26.065
Where's Brick?

04:30.603 --> 04:32.138
Oh, look.

04:32.138 --> 04:34.073
I found the store that
sells the Disney merchandise.

04:34.073 --> 04:36.142
How lucky is that?

04:36.142 --> 04:36.709
[Chuckles lightly]

04:36.709 --> 04:38.978
I'll take this one, Timothy.

04:38.978 --> 04:40.913
Would you like us to embroider it for you?

04:40.913 --> 04:42.949
We have three different
fonts to choose from.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.717
Oh, no. He said the "F" word.

04:46.586 --> 04:49.155
Hmm.

04:49.155 --> 04:51.424
The basic font is easier to read,

04:51.424 --> 04:53.793
but I do like the fun font.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.595
Yep, fun. Definitely fun.

04:56.595 --> 04:57.496
Great choice.

04:57.496 --> 04:59.232
Uh, now all you have to do is pick a color.

04:59.232 --> 05:03.532
We have gold, black, dark pink, white, red.

05:05.071 --> 05:07.006
- [Sighs]
- Thank you, Timothy.

05:07.106 --> 05:09.609
I appreciate your patience
with all my thread questions...

05:09.609 --> 05:11.711
Unlike my family.

05:11.711 --> 05:14.580
- [Sighs]
- I just need to check one last thing.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.415
All right.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.953
Whew! No ear shadow.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.121
Okay.

05:22.121 --> 05:23.422
Done and done.

05:23.422 --> 05:25.024
I'm ready to go back to the hotel.

05:25.024 --> 05:28.194
Brick, we haven't even
gone on any rides yet.

05:28.194 --> 05:28.961
Wait.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.596
So, we're going on rides now?

05:30.596 --> 05:32.031
- What did you think we were doing?
- Duh.

05:32.031 --> 05:34.000
- That was the plan.
- [Sighs]

05:34.000 --> 05:35.401
I'm just saying this is new information.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.136
It would have been nice to have a heads up.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.007
Oh, my God!

05:41.007 --> 05:43.108
It's 2:00, and we've
literally done nothing!

05:43.108 --> 05:44.576
That's not entirely true.

05:44.576 --> 05:45.577
We already lost Brick.

05:45.577 --> 05:47.079
I didn't have that
happening till later today.

05:47.079 --> 05:48.681
So, if you think about it,
we're ahead of schedule.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.215
Well, I'll go on anything at this point.

05:50.215 --> 05:51.350
I mean, there's no line for Dumbo.

05:51.350 --> 05:52.151
Let's just go on that.

05:52.151 --> 05:53.319
I mean, maybe if I tip the guy,

05:53.319 --> 05:54.987
he'll crank it up to puke speed.

05:54.987 --> 05:56.155
No. No, no, no.

05:56.155 --> 05:58.291
According to section three of my binder,

05:58.291 --> 06:00.359
A.K.A. "Sue's Rockin' ride guide,"

06:00.359 --> 06:02.161
the line for Dumbo is always short,

06:02.161 --> 06:04.063
but Buzz Lightyear and his gang

06:04.063 --> 06:05.598
are performing in five minutes,

06:05.598 --> 06:08.100
leaving the line to
space mountain wide open.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.302
[Laughs]

06:09.302 --> 06:10.469
Whoo!

06:14.140 --> 06:16.342
What? That's not right.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.277
This is supposed to be the short time.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.646
Oh, I must have been
looking at the wrong section.

06:20.646 --> 06:21.320
[Grunts]

06:21.322 --> 06:22.915
I just have to get to
the afternoon schedule.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.817
- [Groans]
- Can we please just split up?!

06:24.817 --> 06:26.652
I'll take dad and one more person.

06:26.652 --> 06:29.021
Wait, who do we want?
Dopey, Naggy, or Dorky?

06:29.021 --> 06:30.356
This is not my fault, Axl!

06:30.356 --> 06:32.024
Things are shifting.

06:32.024 --> 06:33.192
My whole binder system's off

06:33.192 --> 06:34.160
because we got a late start.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.595
Yeah, 'cause you fainted.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.196
And we had to get Brick's hat.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.864
And dad drove us to the wrong state.

06:38.864 --> 06:40.066
Your mom didn't read the tickets.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.667
There it is... always back to mom.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.269
Come on, let's all just take a breath

06:43.269 --> 06:44.503
and go to Epcot.

06:44.503 --> 06:46.038
No. No, no, no, no.

06:46.038 --> 06:47.373
If my calculations are correct,

06:47.373 --> 06:49.242
this is the exact perfect time
to hit the haunted mansion.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.343
Trust me.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.178
I've done my homework.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.045
All right. Come on.

06:54.313 --> 06:56.082
Frankie: Ooh!

06:56.082 --> 06:59.051
They say even a broken
clock is right twice a day,

06:59.051 --> 07:02.188
and if anybody was our
family's broken clock, it's Sue.

07:02.188 --> 07:03.689
Uh-oh.

07:03.689 --> 07:06.192
Where's my hat?

07:08.995 --> 07:10.062
There it is.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.064
Okay, I'm gonna say this one more time.

07:12.064 --> 07:13.466
A lot of people have that hat.

07:13.466 --> 07:14.300
Come on, Brick.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.035
Where did you last have it?

07:16.035 --> 07:18.070
Let's see. I had it at Dumbo.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.338
Then I went in the bathroom,

07:19.338 --> 07:21.540
and I didn't want it to get
dirty, so I put it on the shelf.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.175
But then, I thought someone might steal it,

07:23.175 --> 07:24.343
so I put it in my backpack.

07:25.678 --> 07:26.679
Yep, here it is.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.381
- Brick!
- You're going in the backpack next!

07:28.381 --> 07:30.783
All right, all right! Let's
not turn on each other.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.052
Listen, we're all getting
cranky 'cause we're hungry.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.587
I say we get some fuel in us, regroup,

07:35.587 --> 07:37.222
and we're all gonna feel better.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.128
Mmm. See?

07:42.128 --> 07:44.096
I told you these Turkey
legs were a good call.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.232
It's the most famous food in the park,

07:46.232 --> 07:48.234
and you can eat them
while you wait in line. Mm.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.302
I hate to say it, but Sue's ugly and right.

07:50.302 --> 07:51.503
- Yeah.
- [Chuckles]

07:51.503 --> 07:52.571
- Whoo!
- Ooh!

07:52.571 --> 07:54.706
Sorry, folks. We can't
allow any food on the rides.

07:54.706 --> 07:56.775
Now, if you'd like, I can
toss them in the trash for you.

07:56.775 --> 07:58.543
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to
ask you to step out of line

07:58.543 --> 07:59.078
and finish them.

07:59.078 --> 08:00.379
No, no, no. We're not getting out.

08:00.379 --> 08:01.614
We can finish these quick.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.049
Come on, guys. Eat, eat.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.150
- Go, eat. Faster.
- [Muffled]

08:04.150 --> 08:06.252
Just chew it. Chew it.

08:06.252 --> 08:09.121
[Hacking]

08:09.622 --> 08:13.225
Uh, looks like a little piece of something

08:13.225 --> 08:15.227
scraped your esophagus on the way down.

08:15.227 --> 08:16.996
She's never been a strong chewer,

08:16.996 --> 08:18.264
gulps her food whole like a seal.

08:18.264 --> 08:19.732
- [Chuckles]
- We've told her a million times.

08:19.732 --> 08:21.500
Axl: Maybe we should just put her down.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.102
She's gonna be fine.

08:23.102 --> 08:25.538
Sorry you folks have had to
come in here twice in one day.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.707
So, what's been your favorite ride so far?

08:27.707 --> 08:30.242
So far, it's called the gurney.

08:30.242 --> 08:32.544
[Sue continues hacking]

08:32.544 --> 08:34.113
[Insects chirping]

08:34.113 --> 08:35.347
Okay, night-time events.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.683
Did I file that under "N" for "Night-time"

08:37.683 --> 08:39.118
or "D" for "Dark"?

08:39.118 --> 08:40.119
[Groans]

08:40.119 --> 08:41.587
All right, that's it.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.155
I'm done listening to you people.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.590
I'm taking this thing over!

08:44.590 --> 08:46.425
We're jumping in the first line we see,

08:46.425 --> 08:48.327
and we're getting on a freaking ride!

08:48.327 --> 08:49.996
- [Grunts]
- We can't do that, Axl!

08:49.996 --> 08:51.297
You didn't do the research!

08:51.297 --> 08:52.631
Hey! Look at me!

08:52.631 --> 08:54.133
Look at me.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.135
I am the captain now.

08:59.271 --> 09:01.273
Hmm? Huh?

09:01.273 --> 09:03.142
[Grunts]

09:03.142 --> 09:05.644
- [Chuckling]
- Whoa. We're really moving now, huh?

09:05.644 --> 09:06.813
Good job, Axl.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.647
I'm telling you guys,
this is the turning point.

09:08.647 --> 09:10.082
Oh, we're almost at the front!

09:10.082 --> 09:11.417
A-a-a-and...

09:11.417 --> 09:13.118
We're out of the park.

09:13.118 --> 09:16.555
[Man over P.A.]: We hope you
enjoyed your day at the Magic Kingdom.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.090
Until we see you again,

09:18.090 --> 09:21.193
have a safe trip home and a magical night.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.428
Mickey: So long, everybody!

09:22.428 --> 09:25.698
And we'll see you real soon!

09:25.698 --> 09:26.699
[Chuckles]

09:26.699 --> 09:28.267
Disney World... 1.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.302
- [Sighs]
- Hecks... zero.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:42.342 --> 09:44.214
Frankie: So, the first day was a bust,

09:44.214 --> 09:45.398
even by our standards.

09:45.398 --> 09:47.535
All we wanted to do was lick our wounds,

09:47.535 --> 09:50.551
get to our room, and sleep.

09:51.086 --> 09:54.023
Folks, there's been a
slight snag with your room.

09:54.023 --> 09:56.024
- [Sighs]
- Of course there has.

09:56.024 --> 09:57.059
[Hacks]

09:57.059 --> 09:59.094
Oh. That does not sound good.

09:59.094 --> 10:01.730
Have... you folks stopped
by our first-aid office?

10:01.730 --> 10:03.032
[Sighs]

10:03.032 --> 10:04.133
Oh.

10:04.133 --> 10:08.537
So, as I was saying, with your,
uh, Disneyland prize package,

10:08.537 --> 10:10.839
you were supposed to receive
a standard garden-view room,

10:10.839 --> 10:14.142
but I'm afraid we don't have
a comparable room available

10:14.142 --> 10:15.444
here at Walt Disney World.

10:15.444 --> 10:17.146
It's just a very busy time.

10:17.146 --> 10:18.914
[All groan]

10:18.914 --> 10:19.915
[Sighs]

10:19.915 --> 10:22.451
Look, Todd, I appreciate
everything you've done.

10:22.451 --> 10:24.486
It's just been a really long day,

10:24.486 --> 10:27.489
and our package did
include a garden-view room.

10:27.489 --> 10:29.558
I would love to stare at a garden

10:29.558 --> 10:32.127
while I rethink the
choices I've made in life.

10:32.127 --> 10:34.730
And, as I said, that's not available.

10:34.730 --> 10:36.999
But... I did find another room

10:36.999 --> 10:39.668
that I think you'll be very happy with.

10:40.903 --> 10:42.805
[Hacks]

10:44.540 --> 10:46.141
[Light switch clicks]

10:46.141 --> 10:47.943
Here you go, folks.

10:50.713 --> 10:52.014
What do you think?

10:52.014 --> 10:53.849
[Sighs]

10:53.849 --> 10:56.184
Well, it's not what we were expecting,

10:56.184 --> 10:57.953
but I-I guess it'll do.

10:57.953 --> 11:00.122
- Mike?
- Seems fine.

11:00.122 --> 11:01.090
Great.

11:01.090 --> 11:04.093
If you need anything at
all, just pick up that phone,

11:04.093 --> 11:06.662
and you will be connected to
your own personal concierge.

11:06.662 --> 11:09.164
And you should have an incredible view

11:09.164 --> 11:11.433
of the fireworks going off over the lake

11:11.433 --> 11:13.469
right outside your window there.

11:13.469 --> 11:14.937
Have a great night.

11:14.937 --> 11:16.672
Excuse me.

11:19.008 --> 11:20.843
[Sighs]

11:20.843 --> 11:22.745
- Sweet!
- Ahh!

11:22.745 --> 11:24.146
[Frankie and Sue scream]

11:24.146 --> 11:27.016
Oh, my God.

11:27.016 --> 11:29.652
- Oh, my God.
- [Screaming]

11:29.652 --> 11:32.687
Frankie: Look! They have
one of those refrigerators

11:32.687 --> 11:33.989
that looks like a cabinet!

11:33.989 --> 11:35.557
Check out this flat screen!

11:35.557 --> 11:38.427
Dad, there's a media room with
an even bigger flat screen!

11:38.427 --> 11:40.095
- Are you messing with me?
- No.

11:40.095 --> 11:41.797
You better not be messing with me!

11:41.797 --> 11:44.099
There's a TV in the mirror!

11:44.099 --> 11:46.802
- [Gasps]
- Oh, no. I think I'm gonna pass out again.

11:46.802 --> 11:48.203
Axl: Look at this table!

11:48.203 --> 11:49.471
When I get rich,

11:49.471 --> 11:51.907
I'm gonna buy one of
these and never use it!

11:51.907 --> 11:53.876
Mom! Feel this toilet paper.

11:53.876 --> 11:56.578
It's so soft. It's like a cloud.

11:56.578 --> 11:57.646
[Exhales deeply]

11:57.646 --> 11:59.847
Everybody, start loading
your bags with toilet paper.

11:59.847 --> 12:00.615
Sue, you're on lotions.

12:00.615 --> 12:01.984
Axl, you're on shampoos.

12:01.984 --> 12:03.686
- [Telephone rings]
- Got it!

12:03.686 --> 12:04.739
Don't answer it!
They'regonna make us leave!

12:04.741 --> 12:05.688
[Scoffs]

12:05.688 --> 12:07.789
Hello. Grand Villa Hotel suite.

12:07.789 --> 12:08.691
Sue speaking.

12:08.691 --> 12:10.693
- I'm staying here.
- [Chuckles]

12:10.693 --> 12:12.461
Brick? Where are you calling from?

12:12.461 --> 12:14.996
From the bathroom! There's
a phone in the bathroom!

12:14.996 --> 12:17.032
Guys! The microwave works!

12:17.032 --> 12:18.867
Everything in here works!

12:18.867 --> 12:20.502
Axl: The master bedroom is huge!

12:20.502 --> 12:22.204
[Frankie and Sue gasp]

12:22.204 --> 12:24.006
I call this room.

12:24.006 --> 12:26.909
No, I get it 'cause I won the trip.

12:26.909 --> 12:28.777
No, the masters will be sleeping

12:28.777 --> 12:29.845
in the master bedroom.

12:29.845 --> 12:31.113
- [Sighs]
- Frankie: This is it, guys.

12:31.113 --> 12:33.582
This is the turning point of our trip.

12:33.582 --> 12:35.117
I know I've said "turning point" before,

12:35.117 --> 12:37.920
but this is an unmistakable
turning point, right?

12:37.920 --> 12:40.589
I mean, this has "turning
point" written all over it.

12:40.589 --> 12:42.557
Now, we've only got one
day left in the park,

12:42.557 --> 12:44.426
but it's gonna be a great one.

12:44.426 --> 12:46.228
We're gonna hit it early tomorrow

12:46.228 --> 12:48.530
after we have the best sleep of our lives.

12:48.530 --> 12:52.000
Turns out it was the
best sleep of our lives...

12:52.000 --> 12:53.802
And the longest.

12:54.803 --> 12:56.839
Get up! Get up!

12:56.839 --> 12:58.840
It's 3:00 in the afternoon!

12:58.840 --> 13:01.309
It's our last day at Disney
World, and we're missing it.

13:01.309 --> 13:02.211
No showering.

13:02.211 --> 13:05.114
Just bring the mini soaps,
and we'll ride Splash Mountain!

13:05.114 --> 13:06.615
Let's go! No time for breakfast.

13:06.615 --> 13:08.217
We'll hit the apple bowl
at the desk on the way out.

13:08.217 --> 13:09.985
- [Sighs]
- Why do we have to leave again?

13:09.985 --> 13:11.319
'Cause if we don't leave now,

13:11.319 --> 13:12.754
we're paying for this room ourselves.

13:12.754 --> 13:15.657
I'm with Brick. What do
we have to go home to?

13:15.657 --> 13:17.759
Scratchy toilet paper and dog shampoo?

13:17.759 --> 13:19.361
I say we barricade ourselves in here,

13:19.361 --> 13:22.131
live large for two weeks, and
go out in a hail of gunfire.

13:22.131 --> 13:24.066
I cannot believe we slept the day away.

13:24.066 --> 13:25.868
Damn comfortable sheets.

13:25.868 --> 13:28.036
No wonder rich people look so rested.

13:28.036 --> 13:28.871
It's 'cause they are.

13:28.871 --> 13:30.505
Oh, I can't believe this is happening!

13:30.505 --> 13:32.574
We're gonna lose all the rides
at the Magic Kingdom again!

13:32.574 --> 13:34.008
We want to hit Epcot.

13:34.008 --> 13:35.410
There's no time for Magic Kingdom.

13:35.410 --> 13:36.811
What? So, that's it?

13:36.811 --> 13:38.080
That's it for the Magic Kingdom?

13:38.080 --> 13:39.081
It's just off the table?

13:39.081 --> 13:40.549
Oh, I suppose Hollywood studios

13:40.549 --> 13:41.950
is off the table now, too, huh?!

13:41.950 --> 13:45.053
Oh, well, might as well just
throw these papers away, hmm?

13:45.053 --> 13:47.022
Oh, and Animal Kingdom?

13:47.022 --> 13:49.091
Oh, I guess I don't need these anymore!

13:49.091 --> 13:50.993
Sue! Stop. We are not giving up.

13:50.993 --> 13:53.695
This is the one time in our
lives we are not giving up.

13:53.695 --> 13:55.563
Now, come on. Let's go.

13:57.132 --> 13:59.067
Hold the phone. I think I misplaced my hat.

14:00.502 --> 14:02.871
Nope. In my backpack again.

14:04.072 --> 14:05.607
You all look angry.

14:09.845 --> 14:12.080
- [Hacking]
- Okay, this is it, people.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.448
This is not a drill.

14:13.448 --> 14:14.850
Rides, rides, rides.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.618
Oh, look! We're at the castle!

14:16.618 --> 14:18.921
Oh, let's take a family
photo for the Christmas card.

14:18.921 --> 14:20.622
- [Groans]
- Why are not walking?!

14:20.622 --> 14:21.290
Excuse me.

14:21.290 --> 14:23.958
Could you take a picture for
us? Just press the silver button.

14:23.958 --> 14:25.528
It sticks a little, so you're
gonna have to hold it down.

14:25.529 --> 14:26.527
Okay.

14:26.528 --> 14:28.730
We'll do one smiling and then a goofy one.

14:28.730 --> 14:30.598
Why? Why are we wasting our valuable time

14:30.598 --> 14:32.400
taking a photo for a Christmas card

14:32.400 --> 14:33.802
that we all know will never be sent?

14:33.802 --> 14:34.903
Because I want to show everybody

14:34.903 --> 14:36.204
what a great time we're having!

14:36.204 --> 14:37.305
[Camera shutter clicks]

14:37.305 --> 14:39.141
I'm sorry. Can you do that again?

14:39.141 --> 14:40.175
I know this isn't gonna be popular,

14:40.175 --> 14:41.677
but I'll just throw it out there.

14:41.677 --> 14:43.679
I'm regretting my hat choice.
If we can just go back...

14:43.679 --> 14:45.681
- All: No!
- No more hats!

14:45.681 --> 14:47.516
We are going on a ride right after this...

14:47.516 --> 14:49.451
Any ride that Sue did not recommend.

14:49.451 --> 14:51.553
Ohh! Like your suggestions
are so great, Axl!

14:51.553 --> 14:54.022
We all really enjoyed
your leaving-the-park ride!

14:54.022 --> 14:56.458
But I know all the fonts
now. It won't take that long.

14:56.458 --> 14:58.493
- All: No!
- [Camera shutter snaps]

14:58.493 --> 14:59.828
Sorry. I got to meet my family.

14:59.828 --> 15:01.597
I-I tried to get a good one,

15:01.597 --> 15:03.999
but you were all screaming
at that little boy.

15:06.134 --> 15:07.936
What is wrong with this family?

15:07.936 --> 15:10.606
Seriously, what is the matter with us?

15:10.606 --> 15:13.175
Every other family can figure this out.

15:13.175 --> 15:14.977
They can take pictures
in front of the castle

15:14.977 --> 15:17.378
and agree on rides and laugh

15:17.378 --> 15:18.914
and say, "Donny, come sit next to me,"

15:18.914 --> 15:20.949
all while wearing matching T-Shirts

15:20.949 --> 15:24.252
saying, "makin' memories
Thompson-family style."

15:24.252 --> 15:25.053
Yeah.

15:25.053 --> 15:26.588
Look around!

15:26.588 --> 15:28.957
There are thousands of
people at Walt Disney World

15:28.957 --> 15:30.559
having the time of their lives!

15:30.559 --> 15:32.494
Oh, not this sorry group.

15:32.494 --> 15:33.729
No, not us.

15:33.729 --> 15:37.532
What is wrong with us that we
can't figure out how to do that?

15:37.532 --> 15:39.434
Oh, our family sucks.

15:39.434 --> 15:40.936
We suck!

15:40.936 --> 15:43.138
I knew we should have stayed at the hotel.

15:43.138 --> 15:44.573
Nobody ever does what I want.

15:44.573 --> 15:46.208
Mike: Are you kidding me?

15:46.208 --> 15:48.676
I don't want to hear that from any of you.

15:48.676 --> 15:51.179
I'll tell you who never gets
what he wants... this guy.

15:51.179 --> 15:53.615
All I wanted out of this
whole trip was to go to Epcot.

15:53.615 --> 15:56.185
- Oh, you'll get your beer, Mike.
- What is it with you and Epcot?

15:56.185 --> 15:57.786
You know why I wanted to go to Epcot?

15:57.886 --> 16:00.021
'Cause never in my life
will I be able to afford

16:00.021 --> 16:01.490
to take your mom to Paris,

16:01.490 --> 16:02.991
and I thought this was my one chance.

16:02.991 --> 16:04.159
I could take her to Paris

16:04.159 --> 16:05.994
and we could have a romantic meal,

16:05.994 --> 16:07.629
and that's why I wanted to go to Epcot.

16:07.629 --> 16:08.897
Not because of the beer...

16:08.897 --> 16:11.033
'cause I wanted to do
something nice for your mom!

Do whatever you want. Take your phones.

16:16.605 --> 16:18.173
I'm going to Paris with your dad.

All right. I'm out of here!

16:42.826 --> 16:45.162
I'm gonna see if I can exchange my hat.

16:45.162 --> 16:46.963
I guess I'll hit up Peter Pan.

16:46.963 --> 16:49.265
I'm not sure if they allow
just one person per ride,

16:49.265 --> 16:50.667
but if it's a weight issue,

16:50.667 --> 16:53.136
maybe they'll allow my
binder to sit next to me.

16:56.139 --> 16:59.910
You know, on second thought,
the fun font is a bolder choice.

16:59.910 --> 17:02.178
And maybe I should check
out some of these "rides"

17:02.178 --> 17:03.747
that people keep talking about.

17:03.747 --> 17:05.781
Hey, if Brick's going on his
first ride, I got to see that.

17:05.781 --> 17:07.651
I'll do Peter Pan with you,

17:07.651 --> 17:09.319
and then I'll hit Splash Mountain after.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.688
You know, if we all go on
Splash Mountain together,

17:11.688 --> 17:13.990
we could do a funny group
picture on the way down.

17:13.990 --> 17:14.992
Hey, if you're gonna be in it,

17:14.992 --> 17:17.394
- it's definitely gonna be funny.

we're gonna have to find
the kids and head home...

I wish we could have this much
fun with the kids, you know?

17:42.652 --> 17:46.189
I just don't know why we can't
get along like other families.

17:46.189 --> 17:48.258
I mean, did we raise them wrong?

17:48.258 --> 17:49.993
Is it just the way they are?

17:49.993 --> 17:51.628
Let's not talk about the kids, Frankie.

17:51.628 --> 17:53.997
We're in Paris. They're
America's problem now.

17:53.997 --> 17:55.031
As a matter of fact...

17:55.031 --> 17:58.635
I don't think we had kids. Remember?

17:58.635 --> 18:00.871
We met in Paris when I was a young artist.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.940
Actually, I think you were a Leathersmith,

18:03.940 --> 18:07.310
and I was a waitress working at the café

18:07.310 --> 18:11.314
and studying to be a chocolatier at night.

18:11.314 --> 18:14.184
You came in one day smelling like leather

18:14.184 --> 18:16.219
after working in your shop all day,

18:16.219 --> 18:18.655
and you ordered a croissant.

18:18.655 --> 18:21.725
Right, and you were wearing
that little French bustier.

18:21.725 --> 18:24.661
How come in every one of your
fantasies, I'm wearing a bustier?

18:24.661 --> 18:26.329
Hey, I gave you Leathersmith.

18:26.329 --> 18:27.731
Okay.

18:27.731 --> 18:28.365
Fine.

18:28.365 --> 18:32.502
So, we're living a life
that's wild and carefree,

18:32.502 --> 18:37.202
and I don't, for one minute,
regret those kids we never had.

18:37.374 --> 18:39.543
And after dinner,

18:39.543 --> 18:42.979
we're going back to our studio
apartment overlooking the city

18:42.979 --> 18:44.848
and...

18:44.848 --> 18:47.083
I don't know, Mike. I
just ate a bunch of cheese.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.519
Frankie, it's a fantasy.
Just go along with it.

18:49.519 --> 18:50.921
Okay. All right. You're right.
You're right. You're right.

And that night, Mike
and I traveled the world.

19:28.124 --> 19:31.127
We had margaritas in
Mexico, beer in Germany,

19:31.127 --> 19:33.029
and gelato in Italy.

19:33.029 --> 19:34.831
We should move here.

Italy?

Orlando.

they probably don't exist.
