00:09.217 --> 00:10.260
Wow.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.928
Another Saturday on the couch.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.764
Why don't we make it a goal
to see the sun today?

00:15.223 --> 00:16.558
Go down to the lake,

00:16.641 --> 00:19.060
get in a leaky paddle boat,
make out with your girlfriend.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.647
Whoa, what'd I say? Is paddle boat
insensitive to motor boats or something?

00:22.731 --> 00:23.857
I can't keep up.

00:24.941 --> 00:28.653
No, it's just, we're not calling Syd
my girlfriend anymore.

00:28.737 --> 00:33.616
To be clear, Elena's okay with me
calling her my girlfriend.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.869
-I like hearing it.
-I like saying it.

00:36.661 --> 00:37.495
Focus.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.541
Since Syd identifies as non-binary

00:41.624 --> 00:44.836
I want to call them by a term
that's more acceptable and inclusive.

00:44.919 --> 00:46.504
I'm partial to...

00:46.588 --> 00:48.381
-my everything.
-I like it.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.799
Nope, you gotta reel that in.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.720
Oh, you know what I always thought
was so cute? "Better half."

00:54.304 --> 00:56.431
I don't wanna call Syd half a person.

00:56.514 --> 00:58.975
[gasps] What if I tell people you're
my better whole?

01:00.518 --> 01:01.978
You're not saying that.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.689
Don't you have anything better to do

01:04.773 --> 01:07.609
than sit around and think
of names to call each other?

01:07.692 --> 01:09.652
Alright, I've been
brainstorming names all night.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.864
"Main Squeeze," "Person Friend,"

01:12.947 --> 01:14.532
"Your Gay of Sunshine."

01:15.950 --> 01:18.369
Schneider, we didn't ask for your help.

01:18.453 --> 01:22.457
In fact, we specifically said,
"Do not help us."

01:23.041 --> 01:25.085
But it's my duty as an ally.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.754
You can't call yourself an ally.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.006
It's like when people
call themselves woke.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.007
But I am woke.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.801
I'm wide awoke.

-We're not lawyers.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.265
-"Lovers"?
-We're not gross.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.393
"Longtime Companion"?

01:42.477 --> 01:46.022
We're not two 70-year-old men suing
each other over the custody of a bulldog.

01:47.482 --> 01:51.152
Can't you do this somewhere else?
Alex took his girlfriend to the museum.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.738
And "girlfriend" is Chloe's
preferred term, so don't even.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.950
Wha-wha-what?

01:58.618 --> 01:59.702
Chloe?

02:00.078 --> 02:03.081
Do tell! I haven't seen anything
about a girlfriend on his Instagram.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.166
Oh, It's probably on his Finsta.

02:09.129 --> 02:12.590
Your favorite book is Chamber of Secrets.
Why can't you keep them?

02:16.052 --> 02:17.595
-What's Finsta?
-I don't know.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.638
-Yes, you do.
-Okay.

02:20.974 --> 02:25.436
So everyone has a public Instagram
where they post pictures with their mom

02:25.520 --> 02:27.689
and sunsets and other pretend nice crap.

02:28.106 --> 02:32.527
And then they have a secret Instagram
for their friends, a Finsta,

02:32.610 --> 02:33.903
where they live their real lives.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.822
How did I not know about this?

02:35.905 --> 02:38.491
I have a F-Linked-In, a F-witter
and a F-Facebook.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.870
-Well, do you have a Finsta?
-Of course.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.247
But it's just me
cosplaying Wynonna Earp.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.624
You said a lot of words that sound fake.
But okay.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.879
It's not fake, and it is way hot.

from their parents.

I remember once a bunch of us went out
and the guys were chatting up the gals

07:09.887 --> 07:11.806
and they were so confident.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.183
And I didn't know how to be that way.

"Leslie, let's do this."

07:20.231 --> 07:23.901
But when the next woman walked by,

11:01.869 --> 11:03.329
Wear her down.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.458
Don't take no for an answer."

11:10.544 --> 11:13.714
And ticky-tocky, now he has a girlfriend.

11:15.466 --> 11:19.053
Mami, you literally told Alex
no means yes?

11:19.136 --> 11:24.392
Oh, no, no. What I said was,
"Every no is a yes in disguise."

11:26.018 --> 11:27.061
Oh, my god.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.023
Abuelita, you are an enabler
of toxic masculinity.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.359
Oh, please, I do not enable toxic men.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.695
I clean Papito's room twice a day.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.739
No,

11:38.823 --> 11:42.827
it's how society has encouraged men
to define their maleness as being

11:42.910 --> 11:45.204
aggressive, unemotional, sex-obsessed.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.831
You're just describing a man.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.168
Mami, maybe in your day,
but times change.

11:51.252 --> 11:54.505
Men need to be careful about how they talk
to women, or else they'll get in trouble.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.091
Oh, poor men!

11:57.174 --> 12:01.804
"Now I can't yell from a passing car
that I think a woman has sweet tatas."

12:02.972 --> 12:04.473
I know, it's a shame.

12:05.850 --> 12:11.230
In my day, when I walked down the street,
I would hear a symphony of compliments.

12:11.772 --> 12:12.982
You were being harassed.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.066
Oh, yes.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.068
Much more than all the other women.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.865
Mami, maybe you're comfortable
with that type of attention

12:20.948 --> 12:21.949
but not everyone is.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.659
You know what, then they are crazy.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.703
Women want to be wooed.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.830
Like you Tía Mimi.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.292
Well, when she met your Tío Rico,

12:31.375 --> 12:33.377
she did not like him because he was...

12:34.086 --> 12:34.920
feíto.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.717
But Rico was not stopped
by his unfortunate face.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.638
You see, he had a beautiful farm.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.057
And one night,

12:47.141 --> 12:49.602
he broke into Mimi's room,

12:50.436 --> 12:52.188
and blindfolded her...

12:53.731 --> 12:55.900
and they went for a "drive."

12:58.736 --> 13:00.696
Do I wanna hear the rest of this story?

13:02.031 --> 13:04.033
And the next thing Mimi knew,

13:04.116 --> 13:06.368
she was afraid and barefoot,

13:06.452 --> 13:08.913
standing in the middle
of a sugarcane field.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.707
Oh, my god!

13:12.750 --> 13:15.294
I know, bare feet. Pfft!

13:16.754 --> 13:20.341
Anton says Rico took off her blindfold,

13:20.424 --> 13:22.009
and she swooned.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.678
Because it was dark
and it was working for him.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.556
And then Rico says,

13:27.640 --> 13:30.184
"This can all be yours. Mimi.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.894
Will you be mine?"

13:32.520 --> 13:34.396
And ticky-tocky,

13:35.523 --> 13:37.024
they've been married ever since.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.776
That is romance.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.945
That is the plot of Taken 2.

13:43.572 --> 13:48.744
And "ticky-tocky" seems to smooth over
some really horrifying things.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.872
Okay. Alex,

13:52.414 --> 13:54.333
here's the thing about women.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.292
Oh, boy.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.419
Women are beautiful.

13:58.045 --> 14:01.048
The curve of their neck,
the way that they move, everything.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.132
Preach!

14:04.510 --> 14:05.803
That's why I'm an ally.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.305
No means no. Yes means yes.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.225
But it's more complicated
than that, Schneider.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.103
It can't just be a yes.
It has to be an enthusiastic yes.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.771
A "hell yes!"

14:17.273 --> 14:18.983
Oh, I've never gotten one of those.

14:20.901 --> 14:21.986
We will show you.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.155
-Mom, can I please go to my room now?
-No, honey.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.491
I think it's important
that you watch this.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.409
Really?

14:30.369 --> 14:33.372
Syd, may I place my hand on your shoulder?

14:33.914 --> 14:34.748
Yes.

14:36.542 --> 14:40.504
May I place my hand on your waist?

14:40.588 --> 14:41.422
Yes!

14:42.172 --> 14:44.466
Oh, boy, I can feel the heats.

14:46.552 --> 14:51.807
May I lovingly caress the slope
of your cheek because it feels like home?

14:51.891 --> 14:52.725
Come on.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.227
Is this really what the kids do?

14:55.311 --> 14:56.937
-Yes!
-No one's ever done that.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.857
Be real,
this is how your first kiss went?

14:59.940 --> 15:02.568
Oh, no, not at all,
this one just went for it.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.155
So you didn't know
if you had their consent.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.198
We were just demonstrating the ideal.

15:08.699 --> 15:12.453
I remember she pulled that
Doctor Who scarf around my neck.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.914
-Okay, Syd.
-Kinda chocked me actually.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.792
-Okay.
-The cops had to break us up.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.586
Okay!

15:21.962 --> 15:24.173
I gotta admit,
I'm getting kind of confused.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.467
Oh, my god, me too.

15:28.135 --> 15:31.555
What if someone says,
"I am not sleeping with you tonight?"

15:31.931 --> 15:32.765
And then...

15:33.223 --> 15:35.267
an hour later, they're like, "Eh, fine."

15:36.936 --> 15:37.770
What's that?

15:39.271 --> 15:40.522
Unsurprising.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.402
How many women have said, "Eh, fine"?

15:47.655 --> 15:49.281
Yeah, I got to make some calls.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.452
-Now I'm really confused.
-I know.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.329
It's confusing.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.248
I hate to admit it,
but I feel sorry for men.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.792
This consent thing is tricky.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.377
No.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.045
Women always blame themselves,

16:03.128 --> 16:05.506
and then the man never
has to take responsibility.

16:05.589 --> 16:09.009
During rape prevention week at school,
all the signs are aimed at women.

16:09.093 --> 16:12.471
"Girls, don't dress provocatively.
Girls, don't walk alone."

16:12.554 --> 16:14.348
How about, "Hey, guys, don't rape."

16:17.309 --> 16:19.520
Oh, my god, why are we talking about that?

16:19.603 --> 16:22.356
I took a couple pictures as a joke
and Chloe thought it was funny.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.483
Did she?
Or did she feel like she had to laugh,

16:24.566 --> 16:27.069
'cause she don't know what else to do
with your hand on her boob?

16:27.152 --> 16:28.779
-Okay, Elena, take it easy.
-No.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.531
He thinks what he did is cute.

16:30.614 --> 16:31.991
You are basically a predator.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.200
You're basically a psycho.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.451
Wow, you too.

16:34.535 --> 16:38.038
Good, call me crazy for defending
a woman's right not to be groped!

16:38.122 --> 16:39.873
You're mad 'cause the internet
told you to be.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.084
You don't know my life,
or even leave this apartment!

16:42.167 --> 16:43.919
Because of guys like you!

16:45.254 --> 16:46.505
What are you talking about?

16:47.256 --> 16:49.258
[scoffs] You want to know?

16:51.343 --> 16:52.177
Okay.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.596
A couple of weeks ago,

16:54.722 --> 16:58.225
Syd and I were coming home from the movies
on the bus, and we were holding hands.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.770
And we noticed these guys staring at us,

17:01.854 --> 17:04.982
and then we got off the bus
and they followed us.

17:05.065 --> 17:05.941
What?

17:06.025 --> 17:06.900
Yes.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.694
And they were going,

17:08.777 --> 17:10.612
"Come on, you guys, kiss.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.740
We really wanna see it. Just kiss."

17:13.282 --> 17:15.117
They thought that was really funny, too.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.619
It was actually really scary.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.332
It was terrifying.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.254
And then we finally lost them
in a crowd and ran home.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.299
Since then we've just stayed here.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.303
Which is such a bummer.

17:34.386 --> 17:38.182
Because it felt so good to be out
as a couple and we had such a good day.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.269
Elena, I'm sorry.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.605
That sucks.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.107
-I freaking want to kill those guys.
-No.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.568
I don't want you to bloody
your beautiful hands.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.155
I will do it!

17:59.119 --> 18:02.498
Both of you, please cool it
with the toxic masculinity.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.418
The worst part is,

18:07.294 --> 18:08.754
I didn't stand up to those guys.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.464
I didn't say anything.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.174
Baby, you did the right thing.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.469
In situations like that,
you just have to keep yourself safe.

18:15.552 --> 18:16.720
I know, but still.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.348
I mean, you would never
put up with that, Mom.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.020
Well...

18:27.439 --> 18:30.234
When I was in the Army I had a mentor

18:31.235 --> 18:32.653
and he was my first sergeant.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.157
He thought I was a great medic
and he took me under his wing.

18:38.033 --> 18:41.620
He assigned me to a trauma room
in a tactical field hospital

18:41.703 --> 18:43.330
and that was a big step for me,

18:43.413 --> 18:45.958
and I really wanted to make him proud.

18:48.544 --> 18:49.378
Then one night,

18:50.045 --> 18:54.007
I was finishing up paperwork when
he walks in with a bottle of whiskey.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.679
And right away, in my gut,
I knew that something was wrong.

19:01.723 --> 19:02.599
He said...

19:03.517 --> 19:04.935
"We should have a drink.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.520
We've been working so hard."

19:07.229 --> 19:09.982
And he said how it felt right
the two of us together.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.568
And inside, I was like, "What?"

19:13.610 --> 19:16.780
I mean, this guy was like my work dad
and I didn't know what to do.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.783
Then he got...

19:20.742 --> 19:21.577
close to me.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.620
He grabbed my hand

19:24.830 --> 19:26.123
and put it on his crotch.

19:26.206 --> 19:27.291
Oh, my god, Mom.

19:28.834 --> 19:29.918
Well, you know me.

19:31.044 --> 19:31.920
I'm reactive.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.049
So I screamed
and I kicked him in the balls.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.513
Dang, Mami don't play.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.601
Assí, right in the aguacates.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.771
Mami, please tell me that guy
got kicked out of the Army.

19:50.731 --> 19:51.565
I wish.

19:53.817 --> 19:57.279
My platoon sergeant offered to file
a complaint, but he was honest.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.364
It would take forever.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.827
Plus, honestly,
I didn't want people to know.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.956
Because then that's all they know
and that defines you.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.295
He also said that I might be transferred
and I didn't want to get transferred.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.797
I freaking loved that job
and I was good at it.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.008
But I was scared.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.469
So I said nothing.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.388
Lupita, honey, don't feel bad.

20:23.847 --> 20:27.726
You got through it
because you are strong.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.605
Yeah, but I still feel guilty about it.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.941
See, this is the problem.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.860
If you don't say something,
you carry it around inside.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.696
If you do say something,
you carry it around outside.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.157
Well, it's all super depressing, Mom.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.493
But the good news is
is that the future is bright

20:44.576 --> 20:47.371
because of strong, amazing,

20:47.454 --> 20:48.747
young people like you,

20:48.830 --> 20:50.540
who aren't taking any crap.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.836
And maybe you want to put all that
righteous anger into becoming a lawyer.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.046
That's all I'm saying.

20:57.589 --> 21:01.885
You would rock a pantsuit in a courtroom,
is all I'm saying.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.224
Part of me doing better
is making sure you have it better.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.393
Making sure you do better.

21:10.811 --> 21:11.853
And you...

21:11.937 --> 21:13.480
a little less ticky-tocky.

21:16.149 --> 21:17.276
I'm sorry, Elena.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.363
I don't want to make anybody feel the way
those dumbasses made you feel.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.365
Sorry for saying dumbass.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.033
I would have said worse.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.369
It's okay, Alex.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.788
I know you're a good guy.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.123
Yes, you are.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.542
Just remember there's a heart
behind that boob.

21:34.710 --> 21:35.544
Got it.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.130
Who wants chicken boobs for dinner?

21:45.053 --> 21:47.681
Sorry, wrong crowd.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.358
Well, I just got done
calling all my exes.

21:58.942 --> 22:04.281
I can report that all of my romantic moves
have been 100 percent consensual.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.367
And 1,000 percent disappointing.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.831
I just spent 12 hours
listening to women tell me all my flaws.

22:12.914 --> 22:16.043
Oh, Schneider, you didn't have to call
anyone for that, we're right downstairs.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.088
Would it cheer you up to know

22:20.172 --> 22:23.091
that we found the perfect
relationship name?

22:23.175 --> 22:24.134
"Nerds"?

22:27.554 --> 22:28.472
It's flattering,

22:29.014 --> 22:31.475
it's non-gendered, and it's fun to say.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.353
Syd is my SO.

22:34.436 --> 22:35.687
"Significant Other."

22:36.188 --> 22:37.022
Or...

22:37.522 --> 22:40.650
are they your "Syd-nificant Other"?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.194
Oh, my god!

22:42.277 --> 22:43.570
That's genius!

22:45.864 --> 22:48.742
Hey, girlfriend,
wanna go out somewhere?

22:49.159 --> 22:51.828
Hell, yeah, Syd-nificant Other.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.083
