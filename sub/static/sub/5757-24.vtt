WEBVTT

00:05.173 --> 00:07.541
YOU NEED TO GIVE ME
YOUR PHONE. HANNA!

00:07.575 --> 00:09.543
IT'S REALLY OLD,
LIKE SIX MONTHS.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.646
HAVE MAYA'S PARENTS
HEARD FROM HER?
I HAVE.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.149
ARE YOU GONNA TELL HER PARENTS?
SHE ASKED ME NOT TO.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.450
IF YOUR RELATIONSHIP
IS IN SO MUCH TROUBLE,

00:16.484 --> 00:18.219
WHY NOT JUST LET IT GO?

00:18.252 --> 00:20.421
TOBY, YOU CAN NOT LET JENNA
BACK INTO YOUR LIFE AGAIN.

00:20.454 --> 00:23.791
I AM NOT TAKING THE JOB,
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE
THAT KIND OF POWER OVER ME.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.127
WHERE DO YOU GET THE NERVE
TO TALK TO ME THIS WAY?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.530
TOBY SAID THAT YOU WERE THE ONE
THAT DRAGGED ME OUT.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.199
YEAH.
WHY?

00:31.232 --> 00:32.800
DID YOU GUYS GET
THAT TEXT FROM 'A'?

00:32.833 --> 00:34.668
YES, AND NOW MELISSA
IS THREATENING
TO KILL OUR PARENTS.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.570
MY SISTER IS NOT 'A.'

00:36.604 --> 00:38.339
SPENCER, I HIRED
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

00:38.372 --> 00:40.174
TO LOOK INTO
HER DISAPPEARANCE.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.076
I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.511
( all gasp )
WHERE IS SHE?

00:45.746 --> 00:47.448
"IT'S MY TURN TO TORTURE YOU."

00:47.481 --> 00:49.483
TAKE THIS HOME
AND BURN IT.

00:49.517 --> 00:50.784
IS IT PAGE FIVE?

00:50.818 --> 00:52.286
WHO'S VIVIAN DARKBLOOM?

00:52.320 --> 00:53.721
I'M PRETENDING
TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.289
I'VE GOT SOME
OF ALISON'S THINGS.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.191
WE WERE LOOKING
IN THE BAG FOR CLUES

00:57.225 --> 00:59.760
WHEN WE SHOULD'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT THE WHOLE BAG AS A CLUE.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.570
( rustling )

01:28.389 --> 01:29.890
( gasps )
DON'T.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.492
DON'T SCREAM, PLEASE.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.230
I NEEDED SOMETHING
FROM THE BAG.
WHAT?

01:36.264 --> 01:37.765
YOU'RE REALLY MAD AT ME,
AREN'T YOU?

01:37.798 --> 01:39.700
NOT TELLING YOU ABOUT JASON.

01:39.733 --> 01:43.137
ALISON--
THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO DIFFERENT IF I'D SPILLED.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.506
I MEAN,
JASON'S YOUR BROTHER, TOO,

01:45.539 --> 01:47.908
AND THAT PRACTICALLY
MAKES US SISTERS, RIGHT?

01:47.941 --> 01:50.744
YOU DESERVE
A DECENT SISTER.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.480
QU'EST-CE QUE C'EST?

01:52.513 --> 01:53.814
OOH, PAINKILLERS.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.816
MIND IF I TAKE A COUPLE
FOR THE ROAD?

01:55.849 --> 01:58.852
WHAT ROAD? YOU'RE STILL
HIDING OUT AS VIVIAN?

01:58.886 --> 02:01.455
ALISON, ARIA MET DUNCAN,
HE TOOK HER UP IN HIS PLANE,

02:01.489 --> 02:03.857
AND HE TOLD HER
THAT HE FLEW YOU BACK
FROM HILTON HEAD THAT DAY.

02:03.891 --> 02:08.229
HE TALKS TOO MUCH,
BUT I'M GLAD YOU GUYS
HAVEN'T GIVEN UP.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.631
MAYBE NOW THAT
YOU'VE GOT THIS...

02:10.663 --> 02:13.501
WHY? WHAT'S IN THERE?
WHAT SHOULD I BE LOOKING FOR?

02:13.534 --> 02:15.269
CAN'T TELL YOU.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.340
BUT DON'T GET
HUNG UP ON THE DETAILS

02:19.373 --> 02:21.542
AND MISS WHAT'S PARKED
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.247
I MISS YOU, SPENCE.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.649
I MISS THAT FIERCE LOOK
YOU'D GET IN YOUR EYES

02:28.682 --> 02:30.384
WHEN YOU HAD
TO KNOW THE ANSWER,

02:30.418 --> 02:32.686
HAD TO WIN THE GAME.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.955
BUT THIS
ISN'T YAHTZEE, SWEETIE.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.759
THIS IS SOME SERIOUSLY
MESSED-UP STUFF.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.629
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS--

02:41.662 --> 02:43.764
YOU'RE GETTING WARMER.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.637
( door shuts )

03:00.848 --> 03:02.516
Melissa: SPENCER?

03:05.319 --> 03:06.287
( groans )

03:06.320 --> 03:08.256
Melissa: SPENCE?

03:09.723 --> 03:12.426
JEEZ, IT'S FREEZING DOWN HERE.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.263
WAS THAT DOOR OPEN ALL NIGHT?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.833
( door shuts )

03:32.480 --> 03:35.015
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:35.048 --> 03:37.618
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:37.651 --> 03:39.587
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:39.620 --> 03:41.922
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:41.955 --> 03:44.425
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:44.458 --> 03:47.595
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

03:47.628 --> 03:52.333
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

03:54.402 --> 03:56.670
Emily: SPENCER,
YOU'RE OVERTHINKING THIS.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.273
THEN WHY WAS THE DOOR OPEN?

03:59.307 --> 04:01.775
YOU'RE TAKING
TWO DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.777
YOU PROBABLY GOT UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT--

04:03.811 --> 04:06.046
SHE WAS IN
MY LIVING ROOM, EMILY.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.383
I COULD STILL SMELL HER
CREME RINSE AFTER SHE LEFT.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.686
YOU THINK I'M LOSING IT,
DON'T YOU?

04:12.720 --> 04:14.422
NO, I DON'T.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.690
I'VE BEEN THERE.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.791
AFTER I GOT
LOCKED IN THAT BARN,

04:18.826 --> 04:21.562
I WOKE UP AND SHE
WAS LEANING OVER ME.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.331
THAT CONVERSATION
FELT MORE REAL

04:23.364 --> 04:25.633
THAN YOU AND ME
TALKING IN THIS CAR.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.436
SO, WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
THAT SHE ACTUALLY WAS
IN MY HOUSE THIS MORNING?

04:28.469 --> 04:31.572
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I JUST THINK THAT
ALI IS LIKE...

04:31.605 --> 04:33.707
HOLDING ALL
OF OUR BRAINS HOSTAGE,

04:33.741 --> 04:37.945
AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO SLEEP
UNTIL WE FIND OUT WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED TO HER.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.582
( sighs ) I SHOULD GO
TALK TO THESE PEOPLE.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.817
WE'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.323
( sighs )

04:49.357 --> 04:51.291
( dog barking )

04:55.062 --> 04:56.330
( phone chimes )

05:02.069 --> 05:03.537
( beeps )

05:09.543 --> 05:11.512
WHERE'S EMILY?
SHE ALREADY LEFT.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.781
SHE HAD TO GO TO HER HOUSE
BEFORE SCHOOL

05:13.814 --> 05:16.484
TO TALK WITH THE TENANTS
BEFORE THEY MOVE OUT.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.486
HAVE WE HEARD ANYTHING MORE

05:18.519 --> 05:20.821
ABOUT THAT FIRE
AT THE DILAURENTIS' HOUSE?

05:20.854 --> 05:22.490
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:22.523 --> 05:23.957
DO THEY KNOW HOW IT STARTED?

05:23.991 --> 05:26.460
DO THEY THINK SOMEONE
SET IT INTENTIONALLY?

05:26.494 --> 05:28.429
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.566
( phone rings )

05:32.600 --> 05:34.067
WHAT WAS THAT?

05:34.101 --> 05:36.437
WHAT WAS WHAT?

05:36.470 --> 05:38.706
( phone rings )
THAT.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.442
YOUR PURSE IS RINGING.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.677
( phone rings )

05:43.711 --> 05:45.546
HELLO.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.814
HANNA?

05:46.847 --> 05:49.417
NO, THIS IS HER MOTHER.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.984
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE CALLING HER ON, CALEB,

05:51.018 --> 05:53.721
BECAUSE HANNA DOESN'T
OWN A PHONE ANYMORE.

05:53.754 --> 05:57.758
IT'S NOT MY PHONE. IT'S MONA'S.
SHE GAVE ME HER OLD ONE.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.760
SHE NEEDS TO BE ABLE
TO REACH ME AT ALL TIMES.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.129
WHY? YOU PULLED ONE GIRL
OUT OF A BURNING BUILDING.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.131
IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
ROSEWOOD'S NEW FIRE CHIEF.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.067
MONA'S IN A CRISIS.
I NEED TO BE THERE
FOR HER 24/7.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.136
WHAT'S THE CRISIS?

06:09.169 --> 06:12.139
OKAY, HANNA,
THERE IS NO MORE ROOM

06:12.172 --> 06:14.007
FOR SECRETS AND LIES
IN THIS HOUSE.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.943
IT'S ALREADY WAY TOO CROWDED.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.045
( knocking, door opens )

06:18.078 --> 06:19.847
MORNING.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.515
THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA HONK.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.517
LET'S GO.
MONA...

06:23.551 --> 06:25.919
IF YOU NEED
ROUND-THE-CLOCK COUNSELING,

06:25.953 --> 06:29.657
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO STAY HERE FOR A NIGHT OR TWO.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.925
BUT NO USING PHONES.
IS THAT CLEAR?

06:31.959 --> 06:34.662
GOT IT. SO SORRY.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.831
OOH, IS THAT
AN EGG WHITE OMELET?

06:37.865 --> 06:39.700
YOU ARE JUST AMAZING,
MRS. M.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.702
YOU MAKE MARTHA STEWART
LOOK LIKE A SLACKER.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.403
MONA, MOVE.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.741
( door opens and shuts )

06:47.775 --> 06:49.710
*

06:51.879 --> 06:53.681
( knock on door )

06:53.714 --> 06:55.716
HEY.
HI.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.984
WHAT ARE YOU, UH...?

06:57.017 --> 06:59.219
MY DAD'S AT A CONFERENCE
IN VERMONT.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.555
JUST THOUGHT WE'D CELEBRATE.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.460
YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE
CELEBRATE GETTING A JOB OFFER,

07:06.494 --> 07:07.995
NOT TURNING IT DOWN.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.864
WELL, YOU'RE DEFINITELY
NOT MOST PEOPLE.
MM.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.866
PLUS, THAT WASN'T
A REAL JOB OFFER.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.235
THAT WAS MY DAD TRYING
TO CONTROL OUR LIVES.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.738
AND YOU SHOWED HIM
THAT HE CAN'T.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.473
DID I?

07:19.507 --> 07:22.476
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE
EVER SINCE I GOT BACK,

07:22.510 --> 07:25.045
IT'S BEEN A BIT CHILLY.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.914
THE DEAN IS NOT
PLEASED WITH ME.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.183
LOOK, WE KNEW THAT
THERE'D BE FALLOUT.

07:30.217 --> 07:35.489
BUT THAT'S JUST THE DEAN.
YOUR DAD'S NOT EVEN BACK YET.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.890
PROBABLY GONNA GET WORSE.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.893
MY DAD IS NOT THAT POWERFUL.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.595
IT'LL PASS.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.032
COME HERE.

07:45.065 --> 07:49.469
HE'S THREE STATES AWAY.
YOU CAN AT LEAST LEAN INTO IT.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.908
( sighs )

07:56.644 --> 07:58.111
( sighs )

08:07.621 --> 08:10.223
JENNA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.860
I CAN'T WAIT TILL AFTER SCHOOL.
LET THE DOCTORS DO THAT.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.862
I COULDN'T EVEN
SLEEP LAST NIGHT, TOBY.
I'M TOO EXCITED.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.564
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T--
I'M FINE.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.099
YOU DON'T NEED A DEGREE
TO TAKE OFF A BANDAGE.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.770
WOULD YOU RATHER BE ALONE?

08:24.237 --> 08:27.107
I WANT YOURS TO BE
THE FIRST FACE THAT I SEE.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.832
( gasps )

08:53.366 --> 08:54.768
JENNA?

09:01.775 --> 09:03.010
I'M SO SORRY.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.212
( sighs )

09:05.245 --> 09:07.180
( sobs )

09:11.985 --> 09:14.121
( indistinct chatter )

09:16.089 --> 09:18.692
GUYS, I FIGURED IT OUT.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.194
ALISON TOOK OUT
A CLASSIFIED AD

09:21.228 --> 09:23.931
ASKING 'A' TO MEET HER IN
BROOKHAVEN, AND 'A' RESPONDED.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.933
THIS WAS GOING ON
FOR LIKE A MONTH.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.669
LOOK. "DEAR 'A,' WHAT'S IT
GONNA TAKE TO END THIS?

09:28.702 --> 09:30.638
YOU NEED TO STOP.
A.D."

09:30.671 --> 09:32.272
"HEY,
DESPERATELY SEEKING SILENCE,

09:32.305 --> 09:34.374
WHO SAYS I WANNA END THIS?
'A.'"

09:34.407 --> 09:37.711
LET ME SEE THAT.
WHAT'S THIS ONE?

09:37.745 --> 09:40.113
IT'S THE LAST PAPER
BEFORE LABOR DAY WEEKEND.

09:40.147 --> 09:43.316
ALISON WAS SET TO MEET 'A'
AT 235 SPRUCE STREET.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.885
WHY DO I KNOW THAT STREET?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.887
BECAUSE WE WALKED ON IT.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.056
THE CREEPY DOLL HOSPITAL?

09:52.993 --> 09:54.061
GUYS.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.398
Spencer:
SHE TOOK OFF THE BANDAGE.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.634
SHE'S NOT USING THE STICK.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.670
WHY IS SHE STILL
WEARING THE SHADES?

10:02.703 --> 10:05.138
HANNA, STOP STARING.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.177
ARE THEY ALL HERE?

10:10.210 --> 10:12.012
YES.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.186
THANKS, TOBY.
I'LL MEET YOU INSIDE.

10:29.697 --> 10:32.099
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.701
CAN YOU SEE OR NOT?

10:33.734 --> 10:34.802
HANNA.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.709
WAIT,
THE SURGERY DIDN'T...?

10:41.742 --> 10:43.711
NO, IT DIDN'T.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.246
I WENT IN KNOWING THE ODDS,
SO I CAN'T BE SHOCKED.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.817
THE FUNNY THING IS, I WOKE UP
THIS MORNING AND, UH...

10:52.285 --> 10:53.887
I COULD SEE CLEARLY.

10:53.921 --> 10:56.724
JUST NOT WITH MY EYES.

11:00.493 --> 11:05.198
YOU COULD'VE LEFT ME IN THAT
SMOKY ROOM, HANNA, BUT YOU...

11:05.232 --> 11:06.867
YOU DIDN'T.

11:08.168 --> 11:12.039
INSTEAD, YOU...
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

11:12.072 --> 11:16.043
AND IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT...

11:16.076 --> 11:18.779
THAT PEOPLE CAN GROW.

11:18.812 --> 11:22.082
SO NOW IT'S MY TURN,
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

11:22.115 --> 11:25.786
I'M HERE TO...
TO APOLOGIZE

11:25.819 --> 11:30.758
AND TO LET GO OF THE ANGER
THAT'S BEEN HOLDING ME BACK.

11:30.791 --> 11:37.264
SO CAN WE JUST PLEASE...
MOVE ON?

11:39.532 --> 11:43.971
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU
APOLOGIZING FOR, JENNA?

11:44.004 --> 11:47.240
FOR HOLDING A GRUDGE
AND, UH...

11:47.274 --> 11:49.076
FOR HATING YOU.

11:52.545 --> 11:56.216
WE'VE ALL DONE THINGS
THAT WE'RE NOT PROUD OF.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.452
I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF ME.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.154
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.

12:01.188 --> 12:05.793
I'VE NEVER BEEN THE PERSON
YOU REALLY NEED TO FEAR.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.560
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU BOUGHT THAT.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.295
I KINDA DID.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.331
GUYS, IF THAT
SURGERY DIDN'T WORK,

12:44.364 --> 12:47.034
THERE'S NO WAY
SHE HATES US LESS.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.269
I STILL BELIEVE SHE
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH
THAT FIRE AT JASON'S.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.305
SO YOU THINK SHE SET THE FIRE
AND THEN JUST WALKED INTO IT?

12:52.339 --> 12:56.276
YEAH, I'VE HEARD OF CUTTING OFF
YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE,
BUT THAT'S--

12:56.309 --> 12:57.577
CUTTING OFF YOUR WHOLE FACE.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.079
WELL, IF JENNA ISN'T 'A,'

12:59.112 --> 13:01.314
THEN WHO IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

13:01.348 --> 13:02.449
GARRETT?

13:02.482 --> 13:03.851
MELISSA.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.487
HANNA,
MELISSA OPENLY ADMITTED

13:07.520 --> 13:09.256
TO SENDING ALI
ANGRY TEXT MESSAGES.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.958
IF SHE WAS 'A,"
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

13:10.991 --> 13:13.994
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.063
I THINK VIVIAN DID.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.965
I THINK SHE FOUND OUT.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.100
THAT'S WHY SHE'S
NOT SITTING WITH US.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.269
SO WHAT?
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

13:22.302 --> 13:25.272
WE RETRACE ALI'S STEPS,
GO BACK TO BROOKHAVEN.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.143
WE'RE TOO CLOSE NOW TO BACK OFF.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.347
GUESS WHO JUST
GOT "HEXT" AGAIN.

13:34.381 --> 13:37.250
WHAT?
"BREAK UP HANNA
AND HER HOTTIE

13:37.284 --> 13:39.519
"OR YOU GO BACK TO BEING
A JUNIOR HIGH NOTTIE.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.554
DON'T TEST ME.
'A.'"

13:43.056 --> 13:44.291
'A' JUST SENT YOU THIS?

13:44.324 --> 13:45.893
WHY ARE YOU CONFUSED?

13:45.926 --> 13:48.028
THIS IS TYPICAL
A-WIPE BEHAVIOR, RIGHT?

13:48.061 --> 13:49.863
PUSHING ME
TO BREAK YOU GUYS UP.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.266
DID YOU GET A TEXT, TOO?

13:53.300 --> 13:56.136
I'M PHONELESS, REMEMBER?

13:56.169 --> 13:58.605
DAMN, I FORGOT. HERE.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.140
CHECK AND SEE IF YOU WERE HIT.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.345
I HAVEN'T RECEIVED
ANYTHING SINCE THE FIRE.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.448
THEN JENNA CAME IN THIS MORNING
ALL SORRY AND KUMBAYA.

14:08.481 --> 14:12.285
HOLD IT. JENNA MARSHALL
IS SENDING THESE?

14:12.319 --> 14:14.621
GOD, I THOUGHT
THAT BLIND "BEYOTCH"
ONLY STOLE BOYFRIENDS.

14:14.654 --> 14:18.191
I DIDN'T SAY THAT, ALL RIGHT?
MONA, I'VE GOTTA GO.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.594
HANNA, WAIT.
WHO DO YOU THINK
IS SENDING THESE?

14:21.628 --> 14:24.631
HONESTLY, I HAVE NO IDEA,
BUT MAYBE I'LL GET MORE
INFORMATION AFTER BROOKHAVEN.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.599
WHAT'S IN BROOKHAVEN?

14:28.001 --> 14:29.970
HEY.
HEY.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.239
SORRY ABOUT THIS MORNING.
DID YOU GET IN TROUBLE?

14:32.272 --> 14:34.074
I'M ALWAYS IN TROUBLE.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.346
SO ARE WE STILL ON FOR TONIGHT?

14:39.379 --> 14:42.249
YES, UM...

14:42.282 --> 14:46.253
MONA'S SLEEPING OVER, THOUGH,
SO MAYBE SHE CAN JOIN US?

14:46.286 --> 14:48.388
OH, GREAT.

14:48.421 --> 14:52.225
ACTUALLY, I CAN'T.
GOT A PAPER DUE.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.962
BUT WE'RE STILL ON
FOR OUR SLUMBER PARTY.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.096
SEE YA.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.666
CAN YOU AT LEAST
PRETEND NOT TO HATE HER?

14:59.699 --> 15:03.070
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.230
HE COULDN'T RUN
EZRA OUT OF TOWN,
SO NOW HE'S SHIPPING ME OFF.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.631
WHAT DID EZRA SAY?

15:31.664 --> 15:33.366
WELL, HE'S NOT
REALLY SURPRISED.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.102
MY DAD'S
TURNING THIS INTO A WAR.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.636
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

15:36.669 --> 15:38.371
LOOK, CAN YOU JUST HURRY UP
AND FIGURE IT OUT?

15:38.405 --> 15:40.340
BECAUSE VERMONT
IS LIKE ICELAND THE SEQUEL.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.075
WAIT, THERE'S NO 235.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.543
YOU GUYS, LOOK.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.382
UM, HI.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.951
HI. UM, SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.754
WE'RE NOT OPEN.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.689
OH, WELL,
WE'VE TRIED TO CALL YOU,

15:56.723 --> 15:58.425
YOUR SHOP
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.227
WE JUST WANT TO ASK
A FEW QUESTIONS.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.263
YOU CAN ASK, BUT IT DON'T
MEAN I'LL HAVE THE ANSWERS.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.666
( chuckles )
UM, WE JUST WANTED TO KNOW
IF YOU KEEP A RECORD

16:06.699 --> 16:09.002
OF ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS
WHO PURCHASE YOUR DOLLS.

16:09.036 --> 16:12.039
WE DON'T SELL MUCH.
IT'S MOSTLY REPAIRS.

16:12.072 --> 16:16.043
OH, UM, WELL,
YOU DO SELL SOME DOLLS,

16:16.076 --> 16:19.246
BECAUSE A FRIEND OF OURS
MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED
THAT ONE AS A GIFT.

16:21.181 --> 16:25.685
WE NEVER SOLD THOSE.
THAT WAS LEFT HERE
AND NEVER PICKED UP.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.721
Spencer: COULD YOU TELL US
WHO MIGHT HAVE LEFT IT?

16:28.755 --> 16:32.059
I COULDN'T TELL YOU
WHAT I HAD FOR LUNCH.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.627
( chuckles )
Y'ALL BETTER COME INSIDE.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.330
( laughs )

16:37.364 --> 16:43.303
SETH, BABY, TURN ON THE LIGHT,
WOULD YA? WE GOT GUESTS.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.343
MY LATE SISTER DID THE BOOKS.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.612
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO SELL THE SHOP.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.347
( chuckles ) NO TAKERS.

16:54.381 --> 16:57.617
KIDS THESE DAYS ONLY LIKE
THINGS THEY CAN GOOGLE.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.220
WHICH DOLL WAS IT AGAIN?

17:00.253 --> 17:04.357
SO MANY FACES IN HERE,
THEY START TO BLUR.

17:04.391 --> 17:08.761
UH, IT WAS A SMALL ONE,
KIND OF FOLKSY AND BURLAP-Y.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.263
TERRIFYING.
THEY MEAN THE VOODOO DOLL.

17:11.298 --> 17:15.502
THERE WAS ANOTHER GIRL CAME IN
ASKING ABOUT THE SAME ONE.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.803
WHEN WAS THAT?

17:16.836 --> 17:18.438
SUMMER BEFORE LAST.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.707
I CAN'T MAKE HEADS OR TAILS
OUT OF THIS.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.109
LET ME CHECK
THAT STACK OVER THERE.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.678
THIS GIRL WHO CAME IN...

17:25.712 --> 17:27.280
WHAT WAS SHE ASKING?

17:27.314 --> 17:29.149
SHE WANTED TO KNOW
WHO BOUGHT IT.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.117
WAS THIS HER?

17:32.352 --> 17:35.722
THAT'S HER FACE,
BUT SHE HAD DARK HAIR.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.258
LOTS OF IT, LIKE THAT.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.829
UM, DID YOU
EVER FIGURE IT OUT?

17:42.862 --> 17:44.831
THE PERSON THAT
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR?

17:44.864 --> 17:48.601
NO, BUT I TOLD HER
TO STOP LOOKING.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.137
WHY?

17:50.170 --> 17:52.572
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO WANTED TO HURT HER.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.107
A MAN AND A WOMAN.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.308
SETH, HOLD YOUR TONGUE.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.345
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

17:58.378 --> 18:00.580
WHEN DID THESE PEOPLE
COME INTO THE SHOP?

18:00.613 --> 18:05.252
THEY DIDN'T. THAT'S SOMETHING
HE SAW IN HIS MIND.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.587
HE SEES THINGS--

18:07.620 --> 18:09.189
THINGS THAT HAVEN'T
HAPPENED YET.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.324
HE'S GIFTED.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.764
THIS COUPLE WHO WAS AFTER HER...

18:17.797 --> 18:19.499
WHAT DID THEY LOOK LIKE?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.901
DARK HAIR, LIKE YOURS.

18:21.934 --> 18:25.872
UM, WAS SHE WEARING SUNGLASSES?
DID SHE HAVE A CANE?

18:25.905 --> 18:28.341
IS SHE BLIND?
OH, NO, SHE CAN SEE.

18:28.375 --> 18:33.846
SETH, BABY, WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE THE GROCERIES
UP TO THE KITCHEN, HEAR?

18:36.283 --> 18:38.918
SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.689
MUST HAVE BEEN AWFUL,
BREATHING DIRT INTO YOUR LUNGS.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.691
I DON'T EVEN LIKE
SAND IN MY MOUTH.

18:44.724 --> 18:48.395
SETH, BABY, GO.
YOU SAID ENOUGH.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.811
YOU THINK THIS
WILL BE ENOUGH TO SPLIT?

19:07.347 --> 19:10.450
GUYS, SERIOUSLY,
HE'S NINE YEARS OLD,

19:10.483 --> 19:14.187
HE'S NEVER SEEN THE SUN,
AND HE PROBABLY LIVES IN
A CUPBOARD WITH LIKE 600 DOLLS.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.789
OKAY? SO YOU DON'T NEED
TO GET ALL FREAKED OUT

19:16.823 --> 19:19.359
OVER A NEWSFLASH
FROM CASPER THE FRIENDLY HOST.

19:19.392 --> 19:24.931
ARIA, HE REMEMBERS ALISON.
OKAY? HE WARNED HER THAT
SOMETHING BAD WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

19:24.964 --> 19:28.268
WELL, IF IT WASN'T JENNA
AND GARRETT, WHO WAS THE COUPLE
HE SAW IN HIS HEAD?

19:28.301 --> 19:30.270
MELISSA AND IAN.
CAN YOU LET IT GO?

19:30.303 --> 19:32.272
NO, HE SAID THE GIRL
WASN'T BLIND.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.840
YEAH, WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WE HAVE TO GO BACK THERE.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.708
YEAH, WE DO.

19:35.742 --> 19:39.612
MY PARENTS THOUGHT THAT MELISSA
COULD'VE KILLED ALISON.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.316
SAY THAT AGAIN.

19:43.350 --> 19:48.321
THEY HIRED A DETECTIVE
AFTER ALI DISAPPEARED.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.724
WHAT DID THE DETECTIVE FIND?

19:51.758 --> 19:53.726
I DON'T KNOW, BUT MELISSA
TRIED TO CONVINCE ME

19:53.760 --> 19:56.296
THAT MY FATHER
WANTED TO SEE ALI DEAD.

19:56.329 --> 20:02.602
WAIT. MELISSA ACCUSED
YOUR FATHER OF WANTING
ALISON DEAD. WHY?

20:02.635 --> 20:05.605
WHY WOULD HE WANT THAT?

20:05.638 --> 20:08.941
BECAUSE ALISON
KNEW THAT MY DAD...

20:14.381 --> 20:16.849
MY DAD IS JASON'S FATHER, TOO.

20:18.918 --> 20:23.356
SHE WOULD DROP HINTS
AND MAKE WEIRD JOKES

20:23.390 --> 20:26.493
ABOUT HOW CLOSE
OUR FAMILIES WERE.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.362
AND THEN JASON FIGURED IT OUT
AND HE TOLD ME...

20:29.396 --> 20:30.463
RECENTLY.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.267
SO YOUR FATHER AND...

20:34.301 --> 20:36.403
DID ALI RUB THIS
IN MELISSA'S FACE, TOO?

20:36.436 --> 20:39.939
ALL I KNOW IS THAT MELISSA
HATES ALISON'S GUTS.

20:39.972 --> 20:44.911
SHE WORKED IN THE NEXT TOWN OVER
AND SHE PROBABLY DROVE PAST THAT
CREEPY DOLL SHOP EVERY DAY.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.259
HEY. I'M GONNA LEAVE THESE
FOR YOU TO PUT AWAY.

21:01.728 --> 21:02.862
FINE.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.700
WAS EVERYTHING OKAY
AT SCHOOL TODAY?

21:07.734 --> 21:09.736
YEP.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.804
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO DAD?

21:11.838 --> 21:14.674
YEAH, HE'S ENJOYING
HIS CONFERENCE.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.944
REALLY?
HE DIDN'T MISS TOO MUCH OF IT?

21:17.977 --> 21:21.013
YOU KNOW, TAKING TOURS
OF BOARDING SCHOOLS.

21:21.047 --> 21:24.384
( sighs )
WHAT WAS THE PLAN, MOM?

21:24.417 --> 21:27.354
WERE YOU GONNA HAUL ME OFF
KICKING AND SCREAMING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

21:27.387 --> 21:30.390
WE WERE JUST EXPLORING OPTIONS.
OH, WHAT A RELIEF.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.892
WOW, YOU'RE ONLY EXPLORING
THE IDEA OF RUINING MY LIFE.

21:32.925 --> 21:36.028
ARIA, CALM DOWN.
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL?

21:36.062 --> 21:39.499
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE PROCESSING
THE IDEA OF ME AND EZRA,

21:39.532 --> 21:41.634
AND THEN THE NEXT
I'M BEING EXILED TO SIBERIA?

21:41.668 --> 21:45.037
THAT IS NOT WHY
I'M CONSIDERING THIS.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.940
THERE IS SOMETHING
GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE.
I KNOW YOU'RE BEING BULLIED.

21:47.974 --> 21:51.010
THE ONLY PEOPLE BULLYING ME
RIGHT NOW IN MY LIFE
ARE YOU AND DAD.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.613
I AM JUST TRYING
TO KEEP YOU SAFE!

21:53.646 --> 21:56.449
OKAY, YOU MIGHT BE.
DAD'S TRYING TO PUNISH ME.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.486
OKAY, AND THAT'S REALLY UNFAIR
BECAUSE I FORGAVE HIM
FOR WHAT HE DID.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.391
IF I HAD WANTED TO HURT HIM,
I COULD'VE DONE SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.061
I STILL COULD.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.565
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD
HAPPEN IF THE DEAN FOUND OUT

22:12.599 --> 22:15.101
DAD WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH ONE OF HIS GRAD STUDENTS?

22:15.134 --> 22:18.538
WHERE DO YOU THINK
THEY'D SEND HIM?

22:26.746 --> 22:27.814
( door shuts )

22:29.616 --> 22:31.551
OH, GOOD, YOU'RE HOME.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.653
I COULD USE YOUR HELP.

22:33.686 --> 22:34.954
UM, WITH WHAT?

22:34.987 --> 22:38.090
THANK-YOU NOTES
FROM THE BABY SHOWER.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.693
WHO SENT ME
SOMETHING FROM FLORIDA?

22:40.727 --> 22:43.896
OH, IT MUST BE
AUNT JOYCE. SWEET.

22:43.930 --> 22:48.167
I THINK THEY'RE STILL OPEN,
BUT I'M TOO TIRED.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.036
I'LL GO TOMORROW.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.871
OKAY.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.742
WHOSE BAG IS THAT
IN YOUR ROOM?

22:59.946 --> 23:01.648
WHY WERE YOU IN MY ROOM?

23:01.681 --> 23:03.516
I NEEDED
LIZZY FARREN'S ADDRESS.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.652
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO JUMPY?

23:05.685 --> 23:08.521
I JUST--I DIDN'T SLEEP
VERY WELL LAST NIGHT.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.090
UM, THE BAG IS ALISON'S.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.992
JASON GAVE ME
SOME OF HER THINGS.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.694
GIVE THEM TO CHARITY.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.664
IT'S MORBID HOLDING ON
TO THAT KIND OF STUFF.

23:23.703 --> 23:24.804
MELISSA...

23:24.837 --> 23:25.938
HMM?

23:30.877 --> 23:32.812
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

23:36.248 --> 23:38.050
SHE'S COMING UPSTAIRS.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.656
WHERE IS SHE?

23:44.757 --> 23:47.460
HOW DO YOU EVEN HAVE THIS?

23:47.494 --> 23:50.463
DID YOU STEAL IT FROM IAN?

23:50.497 --> 23:52.999
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN ALISON'S BEDROOM
THE NIGHT OF HER DISAPPEARANCE?

23:53.032 --> 23:55.602
I THOUGHT WE WERE BEYOND THIS.
I'M CONCERNED.

23:55.635 --> 23:58.505
MOM AND DAD WERE, TOO.
THAT'S WHY THEY HIRED SOMEBODY--

23:59.906 --> 24:02.642
LOOK, THEY SUSPECTED YOU.
OF WHAT?

24:02.675 --> 24:04.611
I JUST WANNA HELP YOU,
MELISSA, BECAUSE IF
YOU DID SOMETHING--

24:04.644 --> 24:06.145
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.481
I WAS IN THAT HOUSE
LOOKING FOR IAN.

24:08.515 --> 24:10.883
OKAY, SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ANYBODY THAT YOU SAW
GARRETT AND JENNA THERE?

24:10.917 --> 24:13.486
JUST BECAUSE THEY WANTED
TO SEE ALI DEAD DOESN'T
MEAN THEY KILLED HER.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.922
HALF THIS TOWN WANTED
THAT GIRL TO DISAPPEAR.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.157
I DON'T THINK THAT
I CAN HOLD ON TO THIS.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.026
I THINK THAT THE POLICE
NEED TO SEE IT,

24:20.059 --> 24:22.161
AND I DON'T MEAN GARRETT.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.531
I'D BE CAREFUL, SPENCE.

24:24.564 --> 24:29.068
YOU TURN THAT IN,
THERE ARE OTHER VIDEOS
OUT THERE THAT MIGHT SURFACE.

24:29.101 --> 24:32.939
I'VE SEEN SOME STUFF THAT
MAKES YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
LOOK PRETTY BAD.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.174
LIKE WHAT?

24:35.207 --> 24:37.644
I NEVER ASKED QUESTIONS
ABOUT WHAT I SAW,

24:37.677 --> 24:39.879
BUT I'M GUESSING
THAT THE POLICE WILL.

24:52.625 --> 24:55.094
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG HAND
TO PLAY WITH NO CARDS.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.730
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
HAVE NOTHING. YOU PLAY BIG
AND YOU PSYCHE EVERYBODY OUT.

24:57.764 --> 25:00.833
OKAY, BUT WHAT IF MELISSA
IS TELLING THE TRUTH?

25:00.867 --> 25:02.935
WHAT IF THERE
WAS A CAMERA ON US
THE NIGHT OF THE JENNA THING?

25:02.969 --> 25:05.705
YOU KNOW WHAT?
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.874
IF WE HAVE TO TRICK MELISSA
INTO SENDING A TEXT MESSAGE
TO PROVE THAT SHE'S 'A,'

25:07.907 --> 25:09.508
THEN THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.712
( bell rings )

25:12.745 --> 25:14.180
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

25:14.213 --> 25:15.848
IS THIS SOME KIND OF TEST?

25:15.882 --> 25:17.316
PLEASE?
OKAY.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.986
CRACKING THE CODE
TO A CELL PHONE IS ONE THING,

25:20.019 --> 25:22.989
BUT NOW WE ARE CROSSING OVER
TO LIKE FEAR FACTOR TERRITORY.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.757
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT MONA.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.759
I KNOW, BUT I ALSO KNOW

25:26.793 --> 25:28.761
THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE
TRYING TO SPLIT US UP.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.262
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN SINCE--

25:30.296 --> 25:32.264
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT
THIS PERSON'S ALREADY DONE.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.734
IT'S ABOUT WHAT
WE CAN GET THEM TO DO.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.169
NOW. TONIGHT.

25:43.876 --> 25:44.977
MOM...

25:49.081 --> 25:51.884
DID YOU MAKE THAT CALL
TO THE DEAN?

25:51.918 --> 25:53.720
NO.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.625
WELL, I TALKED
TO YOUR FATHER,

25:58.658 --> 26:02.161
AND THE BOARDING SCHOOL IDEA
HAS BEEN SHELVED FOR THE MOMENT.

26:02.194 --> 26:05.798
OH, THANK YOU.
NO, DON'T THANK ME.

26:05.832 --> 26:09.101
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
YOU GUYS PUSHED ME
INTO A CORNER.

26:09.135 --> 26:11.938
YOUR THREAT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH OUR DECISION.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.240
WHY WOULD WE SEND YOU
TO ANOTHER STATE

26:14.273 --> 26:17.376
WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY
A MILLION MILES AWAY?

26:17.409 --> 26:21.981
I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE
THE KID WHO WOULD TURN
ON HER OWN FAMILY.

26:22.014 --> 26:25.384
YOU CAN'T ASK ME
TO TURN ON EZRA EITHER, MOM.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.988
YOU KNOW, WHEN I FOUND OUT
ABOUT YOU TWO,

26:29.021 --> 26:32.091
I WAS ANGRY
AND I WAS CONFUSED.

26:32.124 --> 26:35.995
BUT I HAVE NEVER
BEEN ASHAMED OF YOU...
UNTIL YESTERDAY.

26:36.028 --> 26:39.866
IF YOU COULD'VE HEARD
THE SILENCE ON THE
OTHER END OF THE PHONE

26:39.899 --> 26:43.235
WHEN I TOLD YOUR FATHER
WHAT YOU SAID...

26:45.304 --> 26:48.641
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO
GET BACK TO WHO WE ONCE WERE.

27:10.396 --> 27:11.798
( car alarm beeps )

27:19.238 --> 27:20.306
( bell jingles )

27:29.248 --> 27:31.183
( puts car in park )

27:39.258 --> 27:40.359
( sighs )

27:42.294 --> 27:45.865
SO SHOULD WE PUT
THE DOME LIGHT ON?

27:45.898 --> 27:49.035
OR IS THAT TOO WEIRD?

27:49.068 --> 27:52.271
( chuckles )
I THINK WE PASSED WEIRD
ABOUT TWO BLOCKS AGO.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.143
( sighs )

27:57.176 --> 27:58.845
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
UNBUCKLING.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.113
WHY?
THE CAR STOPPED MOVING.
WE'RE PARKED.

28:09.155 --> 28:13.359
CALEB, LOOK,
I'M NOT AN IDIOT, OKAY?

28:15.161 --> 28:17.263
I KNOW YOU'D LIKE TO SEE
MY HEAD ON A STICK.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.865
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S JUST NOT GO THERE.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.867
WE HAVE TO, OKAY?

28:20.900 --> 28:23.836
'CAUSE WE BOTH LOVE HANNA,
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.342
AFTER ALISON DISAPPEARED,

28:30.376 --> 28:33.345
ME AND HANNA
GOT REALLY TIGHT.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.482
JUNIOR HIGH WAS HELLACIOUS.

28:36.515 --> 28:39.819
WE BOTH NEEDED
EXTREME MAKEOVERS,

28:39.852 --> 28:41.420
AND WE GOT 'EM.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.322
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.058
AND THEN...

28:46.092 --> 28:47.827
YOU.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.097
YOU KNOW, HANNA
FOUND THIS GREAT GUY,

28:51.130 --> 28:54.934
AND I WAS LIKE SERIAL DATING
THE LACROSSE TEAM.

28:57.870 --> 29:01.774
I ADMIT...
I WAS JEALOUS.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.480
( bell jingles )

29:12.218 --> 29:13.319
( phone beeps )

29:15.487 --> 29:17.857
IT'S SHOWTIME.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.828
( sighs )

29:32.238 --> 29:34.106
( indistinct chatter )

29:43.515 --> 29:45.484
( bell jingles )

29:45.517 --> 29:48.354
CALEB, DON'T STOP.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.056
WE'RE DOING THIS FOR HANNA.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.010
( car alarm beeps )

30:21.153 --> 30:22.388
( sighs )

30:22.421 --> 30:24.156
ARE YOU SURE
THAT MELISSA WENT--

30:24.190 --> 30:25.424
POSITIVE.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.126
EMILY FOLLOWED HER THERE.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.198
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU GOT HIM TO AGREE.

30:32.231 --> 30:35.201
HE LOVES ME MORE THAN
HE HATES MONA, THAT'S HOW.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.436
BELIEVE ME,
I'M NOT DIGGING THIS EITHER.

30:40.472 --> 30:41.908
( phone chimes )

30:41.941 --> 30:43.175
WHO'S IT FROM?

30:43.209 --> 30:44.310
HANNA, LET ME SEE.

30:46.112 --> 30:50.049
DO WE NEED ANY MORE PROOF?
IT'S BEEN MELISSA ALL ALONG.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.018
SPENCER'S SISTER'S 'A."

30:59.325 --> 31:00.893
WAIT, WHO?
THE POLICE.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.594
ARE YOU DRIVING OR ME?

31:02.628 --> 31:04.330
HANNA, THIS IS MY SISTER!

31:04.363 --> 31:06.298
WHAT AM I GONNA TELL MY PARENTS?
THEY TRIED TO PROTECT HER!

31:06.332 --> 31:08.467
YEAH, SO DID YOU!
FOR WAY TOO LONG!

31:08.500 --> 31:10.669
WE SHOULD'VE TURNED HER IN
THE SECOND THAT WE KNEW
SHE TEXTED ALI.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.971
( door opens )

31:12.004 --> 31:13.105
MOM?

31:13.139 --> 31:14.573
( door shuts )

31:14.606 --> 31:16.308
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

31:16.342 --> 31:19.211
I DROVE CALEB HOME.
HE TOLD MONA HE WANTED TO WALK.

31:19.245 --> 31:22.414
HE DOESN'T GET WHY WE AREN'T
TRAPPING JENNA AND GARRETT.
TO HIM, THAT'S THE ENEMY.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.383
WELL, HE'S WRONG.
WE HAVE PROOF NOW.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.652
NO, WE MIGHT NEED MORE.
MORE?

31:26.685 --> 31:29.688
I JUST FORCED MY BOYFRIEND
TO MAKE OUT WITH MY BEST FRIEND
FROM JUNIOR HIGH.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.424
WHAT'S NEXT?
HIDING IN MELISSA'S CLOSET?

31:32.458 --> 31:34.994
RUBBING HER BELLY
UNTIL THE BABY CONFESSES?

31:35.027 --> 31:36.695
HANNA, JENNA AND GARRETT--
NO, EMILY!

31:36.728 --> 31:38.564
STOP CONFUSING US!
WE KNOW WHO 'A' IS NOW!

31:38.597 --> 31:40.399
NO, HANNA!
WE'RE STILL JUST GUESSING!

31:40.432 --> 31:42.268
WHAT IF WE SHOW THAT KID
THE VIDEO FROM ALISON'S ROOM?

31:42.301 --> 31:45.304
LET SETH TELL US WHICH COUPLE--
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

31:45.337 --> 31:47.606
WE ARE NOW GOING TO ASK
A NINE-YEAR-OLD SIDESHOW

31:47.639 --> 31:49.475
TO TELL US
WHO'S BEEN TORTURING US?

31:49.508 --> 31:51.410
HANNA, HE REMEMBERED ALISON.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.345
SO WHAT?
HE READS THE PAPER.

31:53.379 --> 31:56.182
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
HE CAN BEND A SPOON
JUST BY STARING AT IT.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.350
HE KNEW HOW SHE DIED.
THAT WAS NEVER IN THE PAPER.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.420
( door opens )

32:01.453 --> 32:02.588
Mona: HEY THERE.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.191
( door shuts )

32:05.224 --> 32:07.059
SO DID IT WORK?

32:07.093 --> 32:08.294
DID YOU GUYS GET A TEXT?

32:10.396 --> 32:12.231
NO. NO, NOT YET.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.066
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

32:14.100 --> 32:17.303
SHOWER GEL.
I NEED TO SCRUB OFF
TEN LAYERS OF SHAME.

32:20.239 --> 32:23.075
WELL, UM,
I'M GONNA GO SHOWER.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.576
SEE YOU BEFORE LIGHTS OUT.

32:27.546 --> 32:30.382
YOU CAN'T TELL HER EVERYTHING.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.118
HEY, THIS IS SPENCER'S FAMILY.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.253
FINE. WE'LL SHOW
SETH BABY THE VIDEO.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.623
THAT'S THE ONLY STOP
WE'RE MAKING BEFORE
THE POLICE STATION.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.401
HEY.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.670
( door shuts )

32:51.703 --> 32:53.672
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
WORKING LATE TONIGHT.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.275
TURNS OUT
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.409
OH.

32:59.711 --> 33:03.415
WELL, UM,
I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.684
THEY'RE PULLING THE PLUG
ON BOARDING SCHOOL.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.719
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
CHANGED THEIR MINDS?

33:07.753 --> 33:12.624
YEAH, I HAD TO DIG UP
SOME PRETTY UGLY STUFF

33:12.658 --> 33:14.793
THAT I'D DEFINITELY
RATHER KEEP BURIED,

33:14.826 --> 33:17.163
BUT, HEY, YOU GOTTA FIGHT
ONE BATTLE AT A TIME, RIGHT?

33:17.196 --> 33:19.431
RIGHT.

33:19.465 --> 33:22.334
WELL, WE MAY HAVE
JUST LOST THE WAR.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.470
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33:24.503 --> 33:26.438
I GOT FIRED TODAY.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.578
NEXT MONDAY
WILL BE MY LAST CLASS.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.490
( no audio )

33:44.523 --> 33:46.358
( knock on door )

33:46.392 --> 33:49.095
HEY.
THERE'S DINNER IF YOU'RE--

33:49.128 --> 33:52.398
NO, I'M GONNA
EAT LATER. THANKS.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.400
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

33:54.433 --> 33:56.668
HE JUST SITS IN HIS CAR NOW
AND WATCHES OUR HOUSE?

33:56.702 --> 33:59.138
WHO?
GARRETT.

33:59.171 --> 34:01.540
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

34:01.573 --> 34:03.275
I DON'T KNOW.

34:03.309 --> 34:05.644
CLOSE THE CURTAINS.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.415
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM
IF YOU NEED ME.

34:09.447 --> 34:12.150
ACTUALLY, TOBY, WAIT.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.085
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

34:29.467 --> 34:30.835
HOW DO YOU HAVE THIS?

34:30.869 --> 34:32.571
GARRETT ASKED ME
TO KEEP IT SAFE FOR HIM.

34:32.603 --> 34:35.574
HE SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.708
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

34:37.743 --> 34:41.513
NO, I DON'T.
THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT TO YOU.

34:41.547 --> 34:44.250
IT'S A PAGE
FROM AN AUTOPSY REPORT.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.617
WHAT?

34:45.650 --> 34:47.719
JENNA, WHY WOULD
HE GIVE THIS TO YOU?

34:47.753 --> 34:50.456
I DON'T KNOW.

34:50.489 --> 34:53.458
BUT I THINK THE POLICE
SHOULD HAVE IT, TOBY.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.427
WILL YOU TAKE ME THERE?

34:59.698 --> 35:01.800
DO YOU THINK
IT'S TOO LATE?

35:01.833 --> 35:03.135
YES.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.575
THEY COULD BE DOWNSTAIRS.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.391
HELLO?

35:30.429 --> 35:31.763
HELLO?

35:35.334 --> 35:39.371
( door creaks and shuts )

35:40.872 --> 35:43.442
( footsteps )

35:43.475 --> 35:45.211
Spencer: MARTHA?

35:46.745 --> 35:48.714
ARE YOU DOWN HERE?

35:48.747 --> 35:53.285
WHY'S THE LIGHT ON?
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY JUST LEFT.

35:57.756 --> 36:00.426
YOU GUYS, LET'S JUST GO.

36:01.927 --> 36:04.463
WAIT. LOOK.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.366
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T SELL THESE.

36:07.399 --> 36:08.467
SHE DID.

36:10.569 --> 36:11.803
MARTHA?

36:11.837 --> 36:14.606
UM, I'M SORRY.
WE'RE DOWN HERE.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.546
OKAY, LET'S JUST
COME BACK WHEN THEY'RE OPEN.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.482
THAT WOULD BE 1979.
JUST FIND A LIGHT SWITCH.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.617
LET'S NOT AND JUST LEAVE.

36:25.651 --> 36:28.354
Distorted voice:

( chittering )

37:42.594 --> 37:44.830
BUT THEY'LL PROBABLY
JUST RE-NAME THE COURSE

37:44.863 --> 37:47.799
AND HIRE SOMEBODY WHO
YOUR FATHER LIKES TO TEACH IT.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.571
I SWEAR TO YOU, IF I KNEW
THAT MY DAD WAS GONNA DO THIS--

37:52.604 --> 37:57.275
ARIA, STOP.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BREAK UP
YOUR FAMILY TO KEEP US TOGETHER.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.811
THAT'S NOT A CHOICE.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.619
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

38:07.653 --> 38:12.358
I'LL... ( sighs )

38:12.391 --> 38:15.627
PROBABLY HEAD UP
TO MY FOLKS' PLACE FOR A WHILE,

38:15.661 --> 38:20.332
REGROUP, SEND OUT RESUMES,
MAKE COLD CALLS.

38:22.568 --> 38:24.503
WHEN WILL YOU BE BACK?

38:31.643 --> 38:35.347
ARIA...

38:35.381 --> 38:39.885
IF I CAN'T TEACH HIGH SCHOOL
IN THIS TOWN, OR COLLEGE,

38:39.918 --> 38:43.389
WHAT'S LEFT?

38:43.422 --> 38:47.092
IT'S WHAT I DO...

38:47.125 --> 38:50.529
AND I NEED TO FIND
A PLACE WHERE I CAN DO IT.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.438
( sniffles )

39:02.608 --> 39:06.077
LOOK, WHEREVER THAT IS,
THEY'RE REALLY LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU.

39:08.747 --> 39:13.051
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU?

39:20.626 --> 39:25.597
* NO, I DON'T WANNA
FALL IN LOVE *

39:25.631 --> 39:29.167
* THIS WORLD IS ONLY
GONNA BREAK YOUR HEART *

39:29.200 --> 39:34.172
* NO, I DON'T WANNA
FALL IN LOVE *

39:34.205 --> 39:37.943
* THIS WORLD IS ONLY
GONNA BREAK YOUR HEART *

39:37.976 --> 39:39.010
* WITH YOU

39:55.494 --> 40:01.700
* NO, I...

40:19.751 --> 40:20.986
WHAT ALL SHOULD WE TAKE?

40:21.019 --> 40:22.588
WAIT, PUT THAT
IN THE DUFFEL BAG.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.856
WE HAVE
TO GIVE THEM EVERYTHING.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.091
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

40:26.124 --> 40:28.494
I HAVE NO IDEA.

40:28.527 --> 40:31.162
THIS FEELS REALLY WEIRD,
GIVING THEM ALL OF ALI'S STUFF.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.899
WELL, MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
IN HERE THAT THE POLICE CAN USE.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.601
ALISON EVEN SAID THERE WAS.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.469
WHAT? WHEN?

40:37.503 --> 40:39.471
YESTERDAY.

40:39.505 --> 40:40.739
IN A DREAM.

40:40.772 --> 40:43.141
OKAY, WHY AM I JUST
HEARING ABOUT THIS NOW?

40:43.174 --> 40:44.976
( door closes )

40:51.850 --> 40:53.952
YOU WANT THIS IN THE BARN?
IT'S HEAVY.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.555
NO, IT'S NOT.
I'LL BE FINE.

40:56.588 --> 40:59.224
I DON'T WANT YOU
CARRYING ANY MORE
THAN YOU ALREADY ARE.

40:59.257 --> 41:00.959
( both chuckle )

41:06.097 --> 41:07.633
DO YOU WANT A BEER?

41:07.666 --> 41:09.167
YOU'RE OFF DUTY.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.638
UM, I'LL JUST TAKE
A SODA IF YOU GOT ONE.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.906
( floor creaking )

41:14.940 --> 41:16.675
IS SOMEONE ELSE HERE?

41:16.708 --> 41:18.644
I DON'T THINK SO.

41:21.246 --> 41:24.082
ARE YOU SURE
YOUR SISTER DIDN'T--
STOP WORRYING.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.917
I'VE BEEN SCARING HER
SINCE SHE WAS BORN.

41:25.951 --> 41:29.220
THERE'S NO WAY
SHE OR HER FRIENDS
ARE TURNING IN THAT VIDEO.

41:29.254 --> 41:31.189
TRUST ME.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.227
( floor creaking )

41:45.904 --> 41:47.706
( knock on door )

41:53.645 --> 41:57.315
OFFICER, HI.
UM, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

41:57.348 --> 42:00.318
NEIL.
WELL, WHAT, UH,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

42:00.351 --> 42:02.588
WE'RE HERE
ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

42:02.621 --> 42:05.857
OFFICER REYNOLDS, WILL YOU
PLEASE SURRENDER YOUR WEAPON?

42:06.925 --> 42:10.161
WHAT? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

42:10.195 --> 42:12.764
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
WHAT HAS HE DONE?

42:12.798 --> 42:14.800
GARRETT REYNOLDS,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

42:14.833 --> 42:17.636
FOR WHAT?
THE MURDER
OF ALISON DILAURENTIS.

42:20.271 --> 42:22.107
( cuffs locking shut )

42:46.998 --> 42:48.900
( buzzing )

42:50.001 --> 42:51.369
* MY HEART IS JUMPIN'

42:51.402 --> 42:53.371
* AND YOU STARTED SOMETHIN'

42:53.404 --> 42:55.907
* WITH THEM THERE EYES

42:55.941 --> 42:57.909
* OH, THEY'RE GONNA SPARKLE

42:57.943 --> 42:59.911
* THEY'RE GONNA BUBBLE

42:59.945 --> 43:03.281
* THEY'RE GONNA GET YA
IN A WHOLE MESS OF TROUBLE *

43:03.314 --> 43:04.750
* YOU'RE OVERWORKIN' 'EM

43:04.783 --> 43:06.017
* THERE'S DANGER LURKIN'

43:06.051 --> 43:08.687
* IN THEM THERE EYES

43:13.659 --> 43:15.761
I KNOW WHAT OUR DEAL WAS,

43:15.794 --> 43:19.731
BUT THIS IS A LOT MORE
THAN I BARGAINED FOR.
