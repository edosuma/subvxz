00:45.210 --> 00:48.168
[Clay] I thought a long, long time
about what to say today.

00:48.960 --> 00:52.168
How to pay tribute,
but also tell the truth.

00:54.630 --> 01:00.250
It truly hurts me to think that my actions
have caused anyone emotional distress.

01:01.390 --> 01:04.132
When I think of the pain
that I may have caused, I-I just...

01:05.390 --> 01:08.974
Well, I feel awful. Every day,
I wish that I could go back in time.

01:11.320 --> 01:15.734
I was used_ to a certain culture
of partying and hookups,

01:16.610 --> 01:19.613
and many of us never questioned it,
but it is time to question it.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.362
And I know that I need to be the one
to set an example.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.572
I'm... I'm trying every day
to be a better man,

01:25.660 --> 01:28.879
to be the_man
that my parents raised me to be.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.293
And to be a positive influence
at Liberty High.

01:33.420 --> 01:36.833
It is my sincerest hope
that you will allow me to do so.

01:38.430 --> 01:39.328
Thank you, sir.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.592
-Does the county accept the allocution?
-We do, Your Honor.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.668
Prior to sentencing,

01:44.770 --> 01:47.762
the victim would like to exercise
her right to make her own statement.

01:48.190 --> 01:49.179
Proceed.

01:49.940 --> 01:50.975
[Clay] I have to admit,

01:51.360 --> 01:54.181
when I was asked to speak today,
I didn't want to.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.060
To stand up in front of all these people.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.947
But it's what Hannah deserves.

02:01.950 --> 02:05.033
Your Honor, thank you for this opportunity
to address the court.

02:05.870 --> 02:08.111
If it's all right,
for the first part of my statement,

02:08.210 --> 02:10.280
I'd like to address
the defendant directly.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.331
-[judge] Go right ahead.
-Why not?

02:14.500 --> 02:17.333
The first weekend in September,
my parents were out of town

02:17.670 --> 02:19.968
and my little brothers
were at their grandparents'.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.210
I wanted to host a party

02:24.430 --> 02:27.342
like I thought
a popular cheerleader should.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.356
My boyfriend was there.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.930
Your friend Justin.

02:38.190 --> 02:39.396
We had been drinking.

02:43.370 --> 02:45.235
We decided to go up to my room.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.123
I remember making out with him.

02:57.960 --> 02:58.915
And then I...

03:00.220 --> 03:01.209
[inhales]

03:02.430 --> 03:06.389
And then I started to fall asleep or...
or pass out.

03:12.770 --> 03:16.262
Ijust... I remember thinking

03:16.360 --> 03:19.272
that I just needed to close my eyes
for a few minutes.

03:25.370 --> 03:26.189
Then he...

03:29.370 --> 03:30.951
Then he walked out of the room.

03:31.660 --> 03:35.699
And then I remember waking up to you
pulling off my underwear.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.712
I remember feeling you
push yourself inside of me.

03:45.220 --> 03:48.383
[sniffles] I may not remember
all of the details,

03:48.470 --> 03:51.303
but I will never forget the sheer terror

03:51.730 --> 03:54.096
of feeling your weight on top of me,

03:56.810 --> 03:58.562
of not being able to breathe.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.828
When I opened my eyes,
I was alone in the hot tub with him,

04:09.120 --> 04:10.496
and there was...

04:12.660 --> 04:15.959
The way he looked at me,
there was something in his eyes.

04:17.500 --> 04:18.489
And I was afraid.

04:19.630 --> 04:22.918
I wanted to slow down,
but he told me not to be a tease.

04:24.010 --> 04:25.716
And he pushed me down on the couch

04:26.930 --> 04:28.886
and said he was glad I had waited for him.

04:29.890 --> 04:32.723
And then he pulled off my jeans
and then my underwear.

04:33.270 --> 04:35.977
And he said
that if I showed my body better,

04:36.400 --> 04:38.140
people wouldn't think I was a lesbian.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.389
He used a different word.

04:40.860 --> 04:43.988
And then he grabbed me
on the inside of my thigh.

04:44.490 --> 04:47.948
At that moment, we were left alone,
and he picked me up.

04:48.030 --> 04:52.865
He just picked me up
and carried me behind the fence.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.743
And he lay down on top of me
and started to take my pants off.

04:57.250 --> 04:58.706
I fought and I fought,

04:59.090 --> 05:02.457
but he was 18 and I was 12.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.712
I found out later
this guard had a reputation.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.966
When he got up from my bed and left,

05:08.390 --> 05:11.803
my roommate rolled over and told me
it happened to most of the girls.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.089
I was a second-year associate.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.728
He invited me to a strategy meeting
in his hotel room.

05:18.730 --> 05:20.857
He answered the door in his bathrobe.

05:21.650 --> 05:23.857
I spent the evening
insisting we work on the case.

05:25.030 --> 05:26.816
At the end of that year, I was let go.

05:26.900 --> 05:31.826
I had been babysitting for this family
for, I guess, two years.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.360
He was my youth pastor.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.694
My second cousin.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.248
Your Honor,
when we leave this courtroom,

05:39.500 --> 05:41.081
Bryce Walker gets to leave

05:41.670 --> 05:44.628
convinced that he chose the wrong girl
to have sex with.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.678
I get to leave
constantly looking over my shoulder

05:48.760 --> 05:51.217
for monsters dressed up
as the popular kid,

05:52.390 --> 05:55.882
constantly on edge
and assuming the worst in every boy.

05:56.310 --> 06:00.189
The sentence you decide today can tell
Bryce Walker what he did was wrong.

06:00.400 --> 06:05.986
It can say that to every boy,
every man who behaves like he does.

06:07.780 --> 06:11.659
And it can say to victims like me
that our story matters.

06:14.620 --> 06:15.496
Thank you.

06:21.460 --> 06:25.169
Prosecution has put forth
a sentencing recommendation.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.967
Does _the defense
have anything to contribute?

06:28.260 --> 06:32.424
Your Honor,
this is a terribly unfortunate event.

06:33.390 --> 06:35.676
And two young lives
have been changed forever.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.307
Bryce has lost all his scholarship offers.

06:39.810 --> 06:41.391
The school district has cancelled

06:41.480 --> 06:43.607
what might well have been
a championship season.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.891
There is regret on all sides.

06:46.980 --> 06:50.564
We urge the court to let
these two young people start rebuilding

06:50.740 --> 06:52.059
and return to their lives.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.827
This is a tragedy all around.

06:55.580 --> 06:58.652
As a judge,
it's my role to look at both sides.

06:58.750 --> 07:02.823
And California law requires every judge
to consider rehabilitation

07:03.080 --> 07:05.128
and probation for first-time offenders.

07:05.290 --> 07:07.417
I'd like to see these two young people

07:07.510 --> 07:10.422
look hard at their lives
and their choices.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.001
But I don't want to do any further damage.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.635
Mr. Walker...

07:18.060 --> 07:20.176
I expect you to walk
the straight and narrow.

07:20.850 --> 07:23.762
I'm sentencing you
to three months probation. So ordered.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.476
-[gavel pounds]
-Your Honor, three months probation?

07:26.820 --> 07:28.469
-[judge] That's all.
-[gavel pounds]

07:29.690 --> 07:32.067
[Clay] I'm angry. I'm sad.

07:32.740 --> 07:35.732
And I still have no idea
how what happened happened.

07:36.910 --> 07:40.289
Talk to me about the sex doll
that was found at Ms. Davis' home.

07:41.910 --> 07:45.243
Or the dead rat
that was inside Mr. Dempsey's locker.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.081
The vandalism to Mr. Padilla's car.

07:49.170 --> 07:50.080
This is bullshit.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.218
What about the shooting target
you sent my son?

07:53.470 --> 07:54.539
I didn't do any of that.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.382
We have several kids
who say he Intimidated Witnesses,

07:57.890 --> 07:59.596
engaged in felony vandalism.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.592
Everyone's saying all kinds of shit,
but it's not true.

08:03.140 --> 08:04.016
Where's the gun?

08:05.730 --> 08:07.607
I never touched a gun in my life.

08:08.610 --> 08:12.819
Your Honor, Bryce Walker was released
on bail within hours of his arrest,

08:12.900 --> 08:16.734
_ _ and Justin has been stranded
In juvenile detention for almost a month.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.776
[judge] I'm aware of the timeline.

08:18.870 --> 08:21.077
The related case is complete as of today.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.861
Justin's plea is in,
the paperwork is done.

08:23.960 --> 08:28.283
Understood, Counselor, but as a minor,
he has to be released into custody.

08:28.380 --> 08:31.122
We have been searching for Amber Foley
for weeks, Your Honor.

08:31.210 --> 08:34.623
-She's nowhere to be found.
-Keep looking. Until then, he's remanded.

08:35.800 --> 08:36.630
Bailiff?

08:40.140 --> 08:40.959
[door opens]

08:41.640 --> 08:43.631
Hang on, Justin. We're working on it.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.055
I know. Thank you.

08:45.390 --> 08:48.018
[Clay] We're still learning
all the ways we've been changed.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.476
All the things we've lost.

08:52.530 --> 08:54.066
I'm so fucking sorry.

08:57.490 --> 08:58.559
It's insane.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.209
But somehow I still feel stronger.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.119
[door closes]

09:13.760 --> 09:14.829
Wait, where's Justin?

09:15.470 --> 09:19.179
They'll only release him to a guardian,
and the judge won't move on it.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.632
We've filed emergency papers,
but it's a 24-hour minimum.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.927
I'll take the petition to Purdy.
He owes us.

09:25.020 --> 09:27.090
Do you wanna start on the order
for the school?

09:27.440 --> 09:28.259
Yeah.

09:28.650 --> 09:32.563
We're asking for a court order
to force the school to protect you.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.480
To keep him away from you.

09:35.190 --> 09:36.020
Thank you.

09:37.070 --> 09:40.403
Mom, is your firm...
I mean, are they cool with this?

09:40.490 --> 09:44.904
I've left the firm...
to work with Dennis on cases like this.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.319
Oh, that's...

09:48.580 --> 09:49.410
That's cool.

09:51.420 --> 09:52.705
[Bryce sighs]

09:55.130 --> 09:58.213
[Clay] We're just starting to figure out
how to go on with our lives.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.937
Coach said we could leave our lockers
till the end of the year.

10:11.020 --> 10:13.682
I'm transferring.
To Hillcrest.

10:14.110 --> 10:16.647
Hillcrest? You got the grades for that?

10:17.320 --> 10:18.389
Not exactly.

10:19.070 --> 10:21.652
Well, private schools
need fields, too, I guess.

10:23.530 --> 10:27.455
Yeah. And uniforms and all that shit.

10:28.910 --> 10:30.571
-[bag zips]
-Speaking of which...

10:33.090 --> 10:36.082
not all of my credits transferred,
so I'll be going in as a junior.

10:36.420 --> 10:38.547
Which means I'll see you
on the field this fall.

10:39.470 --> 10:42.962
-They're letting you play football?
-That's right. See you at the dance.

10:44.350 --> 10:45.169
Wait.

10:47.060 --> 10:50.018
So, you and Chloe?

10:50.770 --> 10:52.146
Yeah. Loyalty.

10:53.980 --> 10:55.106
It's a thing, huh?

10:57.740 --> 10:59.139
Take care of yourself, Zachy.

11:01.950 --> 11:05.022
[Clay] I say "go on" and not "move on"
because in some ways...

11:05.530 --> 11:07.998
we'll never completely move on
from what happened.

11:08.660 --> 11:11.242
Your meeting
with the district psychologist went well

11:11.580 --> 11:14.128
and the reports
from your diversion program are excellent.

11:14.210 --> 11:15.370
It was a good program.

11:16.050 --> 11:16.869
Tell me why.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.831
Um, well, at first, it was very difficult.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.080
You know, the long hikes and the camping.

11:23.680 --> 11:24.965
But after a few days,

11:25.720 --> 11:29.099
with everything else stripped away,
you're just left to your thoughts and...

11:30.520 --> 11:31.475
you learn things.

11:32.190 --> 11:33.225
And what did you learn?

11:33.810 --> 11:35.971
That I can choose how I respond to things.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.528
That even if I am feeling angry,
or lonely, or whatever,

11:39.610 --> 11:41.396
that I'm in control of my own actions.

11:42.070 --> 11:46.825
I can't control what other people do,
but I can control my response.

11:46.910 --> 11:50.789
Do you think you're ready to come back?
Do you think things will be different?

11:51.870 --> 11:52.780
Yeah, I think so.

11:54.210 --> 11:55.029
I'm ready.

11:58.210 --> 12:02.624
Principal Bolan is concerned
that we keep a very close eye on you.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.750
I understand.

12:06.050 --> 12:09.269
And your return won't be easy.

12:10.220 --> 12:11.050
No, I know.

12:13.270 --> 12:15.090
[chatter]

12:17.610 --> 12:18.429
Hey.

12:20.190 --> 12:22.351
Hi! Hi. [giggles]

12:22.610 --> 12:23.440
Hey.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.310
-You're back!
-I am.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.731
-Wow. You look good.
-Thanks.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.401
Yeah, apparently, natural sunlight
and physical exercise

12:30.490 --> 12:32.151
are, like, good for us or something.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.740
-Something. [chuckles]
-Something.

12:33.830 --> 12:36.492
The good news is that I'm back in time
for the Spring Fling.

12:36.750 --> 12:40.083
And I was determined
to make it back in time to take you.

12:40.670 --> 12:43.002
-Oh.
-I mean, or we could just blow it off.

12:43.090 --> 12:45.422
-We could do something else.
-Yeah, no, I mean...

12:46.300 --> 12:49.884
I'm-I'm going to the dance,
uh, with Eric.

12:51.430 --> 12:52.385
Okay. Oh.

12:53.310 --> 12:54.129
-Cool.
-Yeah.

12:54.230 --> 12:57.051
We're kinda dating.
Just for, like, a few weeks now.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.819
Yeah, cool. You know, he's...
Eric's a good guy, so...

13:01.650 --> 13:02.605
Yeah, that's cool.

13:02.690 --> 13:03.850
-[school bell rings]
-Yeah.

13:03.940 --> 13:05.988
-Shoot. I gotta run.
-Yeah, me, too.

13:06.780 --> 13:08.020
I'm really glad you're back.

13:08.490 --> 13:09.320
Thanks.

13:09.780 --> 13:10.656
Glad to be back.

13:12.290 --> 13:13.109
-Bye.
-Bye.

13:15.750 --> 13:16.569
What's up, man?

13:19.920 --> 13:21.831
[Clay] And I don't say
"get back to normal"

13:22.710 --> 13:24.587
because life will never be normal again.

13:27.180 --> 13:31.628
Before we start,
I am distrustful of religion.

13:32.470 --> 13:35.769
Okay. The service can be
whatever you want it to be.

13:35.850 --> 13:39.809
It's just... my mother always told us
we should abide,

13:40.860 --> 13:42.930
and have faith,
accept what's coming to us.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.942
And I think that teaches people
to be passive.

13:46.530 --> 13:49.693
I think abiding and acceptance
is bullshit.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.112
-Excuse my language.
-I don't disagree.

13:55.080 --> 13:55.990
So tell me,

13:56.370 --> 14:00.488
w-why choose a church
for Hannah's service?

14:01.040 --> 14:04.043
We, uh... we both come
from religious families,

14:04.130 --> 14:08.294
and it's something we drifted from a bit,
and thought maybe it was...

14:09.390 --> 14:12.712
something Hannah
perhaps should have had in her life.

14:12.810 --> 14:13.708
We were ashamed.

14:13.810 --> 14:14.629
[sighs]

14:16.350 --> 14:19.808
We were ashamed to have a funeral.

14:21.650 --> 14:22.639
Or a service.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.062
Butthen,
after everything that happened,

14:26.150 --> 14:28.607
if there is a God,
I want Him to see that...

14:31.700 --> 14:34.737
my little girl deserves His care.

14:37.080 --> 14:37.899
He will.

14:39.290 --> 14:40.200
He'll see that.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.245
[Mr. Baker] A few of the other places
we called,

14:45.090 --> 14:49.208
[sighs] given the circumstances
of Hannah's death...

14:51.720 --> 14:53.347
Let me assure you...

14:54.310 --> 14:56.016
there's no judgment from me.

14:57.310 --> 14:59.767
Not regarding Hannah's decision

15:00.810 --> 15:02.721
or the circumstances that led her there.

15:03.650 --> 15:08.064
And I hope one day
you'll release yourselves

15:08.150 --> 15:12.655
from any shame
you might still be feeling as well.

15:24.460 --> 15:28.453
[Clay] Life is divided into "Hannah"
and "after Hannah."

15:29.340 --> 15:31.171
[Clay] I don't have anything
to compare it to.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.131
I've lived here all my life.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.637
It's like asking Han Solo, "How is space?"

15:38.970 --> 15:41.552
Wow. You're an actual nerd, aren't you?

15:42.440 --> 15:44.601
I admire that.
There's courage in being a nerd.

15:44.980 --> 15:46.186
[car horn honking]

15:48.610 --> 15:50.601
["Lovely" playing]

15:51.070 --> 15:52.981
[Clay] Memories are sometimes a relief.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.661
And sometimes they're torture.

16:04.000 --> 16:04.955
[Hannah] I was right.

16:05.580 --> 16:07.491
You're the most courageous nerd
I ever knew.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.255
They asked me to speak.

16:14.130 --> 16:15.040
At your service.

16:16.550 --> 16:17.460
Are you gonna do it?

16:20.060 --> 16:21.175
I don't know what to say.

16:23.270 --> 16:27.354
Or if I can trust myself not to be angry.

16:28.190 --> 16:29.896
So, be angry.

16:31.780 --> 16:35.853
- Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
- Tear me to pieces, skin to bone

16:37.490 --> 16:39.367
Or if I can say what I really need to say.

16:43.620 --> 16:44.496
I think you can.

16:47.290 --> 16:49.087
[Clay] But we hold on to the memories...

16:52.260 --> 16:54.046
[tattoo machine buzzing]

16:54.130 --> 16:55.677
...because they're what we have left.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.549
You're doing great this time.

17:10.610 --> 17:12.771
You can look now.
No more comma.

17:21.160 --> 17:21.979
Thank you.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.616
[Clay] And we have an urge
to remember,

17:24.750 --> 17:26.206
to commemorate another time,

17:27.750 --> 17:29.490
to hold on to this as long as we can.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.166
The thing I'm most afraid of...

17:36.880 --> 17:37.835
is forgetting you.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.169
Then don't.

17:43.770 --> 17:46.978
The thing I'm second most afraid of
is I'll never be able to let you go.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.896
Do you remember the winter dance?

17:53.230 --> 17:54.390
Not the slow dance, but...

17:55.030 --> 17:58.989
that song where we jumped around
like idiots and looked like fools.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.480
Like absolute dorks.

18:03.870 --> 18:04.689
Yeah. [chuckles]

18:06.620 --> 18:07.450
Why?

18:08.710 --> 18:09.529
No reason.

18:10.670 --> 18:12.661
I just wanted you
to think of that right now.

18:16.050 --> 18:20.168
Heart made of glass
My mind of stone

18:20.260 --> 18:24.299
- Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
- Tear me to pieces, skin to bone

18:24.890 --> 18:29.099
- Hello, welcome home
- Hello, welcome home

18:29.770 --> 18:31.010
[Clay] But today...

18:33.070 --> 18:34.310
we begin to let go.

18:59.590 --> 19:02.639
We're here to say goodbye to Hannah.

19:05.390 --> 19:08.598
One act does not define a life.

19:09.810 --> 19:12.768
We celebrate the richness of her life,

19:12.940 --> 19:16.979
even as the tragic circumstances
of her death cannot be forgotten.

19:19.820 --> 19:23.654
[Andy] It does my heart good to see
so many of Hannah's friends here today.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.037
Hannah had the biggest heart,

19:27.790 --> 19:30.247
which she so generously shared
with all of us.

19:31.750 --> 19:34.662
So, please, be kind to each other.

19:37.420 --> 19:41.174
She dreamed of going to New York
to become a writer.

19:43.390 --> 19:48.134
I'm not sure when that dream
began to feel imp055ible to her.

19:50.020 --> 19:53.433
Hannah was my dream.

19:56.270 --> 20:01.560
And now I get to dream for Hannah
as well as for myself.

20:01.650 --> 20:03.277
And so do all of you.

20:04.740 --> 20:05.900
So, please,

20:07.240 --> 20:09.572
dream your dreams.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.707
And dream them for Hannah,

20:12.290 --> 20:14.918
and don't let anyone
take them away from you.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.989
Don't ever let them go.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.383
Hannah Baker came into my life
at the end of one summer

20:26.470 --> 20:29.507
like a star that fell to Earth.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.766
Like nothing I had seen,

20:34.190 --> 20:35.430
like no one I had ever met.

20:36.980 --> 20:40.359
She was funny, and smart,

20:41.900 --> 20:45.154
and moody, and... and maddening,

20:45.990 --> 20:47.696
and beautiful.

21:06.550 --> 21:07.380
And...

21:11.680 --> 21:12.556
I loved her.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.476
I loved her so much.

21:19.690 --> 21:22.727
And I ask her every day
why she did what she did.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.235
But I get no answers.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.036
She took those with her when she went.

21:33.290 --> 21:35.497
Leaving me, all of us,

21:36.670 --> 21:41.369
angry, empty, confused.

21:45.130 --> 21:47.041
And I know that hurt won't ever go away.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.632
But there will come a day
when I don't feel it every minute.

21:52.470 --> 21:56.349
And the anger won't be so hot,
and the other feelings will fade,

21:59.600 --> 22:01.181
and I'll be left with only love.

22:06.610 --> 22:08.237
A good friend once said to me,

22:09.610 --> 22:11.737
"I can love you and still let you go."

22:17.040 --> 22:18.075
So, Hannah,

22:21.710 --> 22:22.529
I love you,

22:25.260 --> 22:26.204
and I let you go.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.038
And I miss you.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.919
And I hope that wherever you go next,

22:38.770 --> 22:39.759
you feel peace,

22:41.650 --> 22:42.765
you feel safe

22:44.730 --> 22:46.436
in a way that you never did here.

22:56.290 --> 22:57.405
Wherever you go next,

22:59.790 --> 23:01.246
I hope you know that I love you.

23:40.460 --> 23:43.452
[people sniffling, coughing]

23:44.130 --> 23:46.121
[bell tolling]

23:49.170 --> 23:52.003
[chatter]

24:01.390 --> 24:02.345
Everything okay?

24:05.110 --> 24:07.066
Yeah. No, Ijust, um...

24:08.440 --> 24:10.772
-I was just taking a minute.
-Of course.

24:11.820 --> 24:12.775
I'll leave you to it.

24:14.200 --> 24:15.189
Can I ask you...

24:20.500 --> 24:22.400
do you believe in the immortal soul?

24:23.960 --> 24:24.779
I do.

24:25.710 --> 24:27.587
And do you think Hannah is going to hell

24:29.000 --> 24:30.251
because she killed herself?

24:35.640 --> 24:36.459
I don't.

24:37.180 --> 24:40.843
I think the God I believe in, a just God,

24:41.770 --> 24:44.386
would have mercy on a soul like hers.

24:46.730 --> 24:50.359
And if God forgives her, we should.

24:51.530 --> 24:55.523
I believe we should follow
His example, sure, but...

24:57.280 --> 24:58.520
it's not always easy.

25:01.830 --> 25:02.785
And do you think...

25:05.670 --> 25:07.319
Does God forgive us?

25:09.420 --> 25:10.660
The people who let her down?

25:12.210 --> 25:13.120
I think He does.

25:17.050 --> 25:22.090
Clay, you don't have to believe
in the immortal soul

25:22.810 --> 25:25.722
to believe that people live on with us.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.840
Wait, what do you mean?

25:28.980 --> 25:31.778
Just that... we've lost Hannah,

25:32.940 --> 25:34.942
but not the things she gave us.

25:36.150 --> 25:40.860
Compassion, understanding, love.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.029
Those don't go away.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.491
["The Healing" playing]

25:51.380 --> 25:53.587
Calm down

25:53.670 --> 25:58.004
Let the world spin around

25:58.090 --> 26:00.342
There ain't no other place

26:00.430 --> 26:02.591
[Clay] How do we take care of ourselves

26:03.520 --> 26:04.885
and look after each other?

26:07.440 --> 26:08.725
And celebrate Hannah's life

26:08.810 --> 26:11.051
and let it remind us
to hold on to each other...

26:13.730 --> 26:15.231
and to the precious time we have?

26:20.950 --> 26:22.690
Do you remember when we first met you?

26:23.580 --> 26:24.865
At that table over there?

26:26.080 --> 26:27.820
You thought we were crazy.

26:27.910 --> 26:32.370
No. I was just, like, terrified
and amazed.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.951
I mean, you guys were fearless.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.751
I don't remember being fearless.

26:41.850 --> 26:42.669
[chuckles]

26:43.930 --> 26:47.229
This is, um...
This is really inappropriate at a wake,

26:47.480 --> 26:49.880
especially given the whole history, but...

26:51.230 --> 26:53.607
I've been... I've been trying
for, like, two weeks now

26:53.690 --> 26:56.181
to get up the nerve to ask you, um...

26:57.150 --> 26:59.607
if you would wanna go to the Spring Fling

26:59.950 --> 27:02.862
as, like, people who date?

27:03.120 --> 27:05.736
Because I think that we are now,
but I'm not really sure.

27:07.450 --> 27:08.280
Um...

27:09.710 --> 27:11.359
[stammers] I think we are.

27:11.960 --> 27:12.779
Yeah?

27:13.250 --> 27:17.835
I mean, I'm not sure how ready I am
to be a person who dates, but...

27:18.470 --> 27:19.664
I mean, we are.

27:21.130 --> 27:22.461
-So, yes.
-Yea h?

27:22.550 --> 27:24.290
-Yes. [laughs]
-Okay. Oh, God.

27:24.390 --> 27:26.847
Is it okay that I asked you out
at Hannah's table?

27:26.930 --> 27:28.557
Oh, it's all of our table.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.181
And I think she'd be okay with it.

27:32.190 --> 27:34.806
She'd probably make you interpret
some weird painting.

27:35.650 --> 27:38.027
Yeah, who picks the paintings?

27:38.490 --> 27:41.391
[Zach] Yo, dude! [laughs]

27:41.490 --> 27:44.061
Oh, my God, you're crushing me!
[chuckles]

27:45.330 --> 27:48.037
You're, like, down to nothing.
We gotta get you on a program.

27:48.120 --> 27:48.939
Okay, sure.

27:49.370 --> 27:52.203
How the fuck did Bryce
only get three months and you got six?

27:53.630 --> 27:54.449
Aren't you pissed?

27:55.380 --> 27:57.041
I guess I just wasn't surprised.

27:58.170 --> 28:00.547
Actually, I'm gonna take a gap year.
I'm going to Europe.

28:00.630 --> 28:04.179
Which, I know, sounds like a clich,
but, honestly, Asia is the clich.

28:04.260 --> 28:06.216
I mean, I could be going to Goa,
but I'm not.

28:06.550 --> 28:07.380
I'm old school.

28:08.390 --> 28:12.133
I've actually been thinking
about doing some traveling myself.

28:12.230 --> 28:14.186
Oh, my God, you should.
You so should.

28:14.650 --> 28:16.606
[Courtney] It's annoying
how smart she is.

28:16.690 --> 28:18.772
I don't like it
when people are smarter than me.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.270
But it's fine because she's cute.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.730
It's so nice that everyone came.

28:26.530 --> 28:30.739
Maybe I should, uh, leave
the two of you alone to catch up?

28:32.540 --> 28:34.360
Maybe you have some things to talk about.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.871
Yes. Yeah, there are.

28:38.960 --> 28:39.790
Okay.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.420
What... What things?

28:52.730 --> 28:54.630
So, um... [clears throat]

28:56.020 --> 28:59.512
I think my mom explained to you how she
got you released into emergency custody.

28:59.770 --> 29:00.896
Yeah, she explained it.

29:01.650 --> 29:03.698
The thing is that's only temporary.

29:04.490 --> 29:06.776
And because you're not 18
for almost a year,

29:06.870 --> 29:09.577
once that expires,
you become a ward of the state.

29:09.740 --> 29:11.992
Yeah, the... the social worker
told me about that.

29:12.410 --> 29:13.240
Okay, yeah.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.827
And there's only two group homes
in this county you'd be eligible for,

29:16.920 --> 29:19.662
and you couldn't finish school
at Liberty and stuff.

29:20.630 --> 29:21.619
And my parents...

29:23.630 --> 29:25.507
I mean, me and my parents...

29:28.470 --> 29:31.257
_ _ wanted to see
if you might want them to adopt you.

29:34.230 --> 29:37.688
[chuckles] Wait, what?

29:38.480 --> 29:41.893
Like, adopt you into our family.

29:42.110 --> 29:44.271
[stammers] You mean, like,
I'd be your brother?

29:44.740 --> 29:48.699
Well, I'm-I'm not familiar
with all the lingo, but--

29:48.780 --> 29:50.520
Wait. Why are you asking me
and not them?

29:52.540 --> 29:54.747
Because it was their idea, to be honest.

29:55.750 --> 29:58.537
And at first,
I thought it sounded, um...

29:59.710 --> 30:00.586
idiotic.

30:01.090 --> 30:04.048
And they left it up to me,

30:04.130 --> 30:07.509
seeing as I was the person who brought you
in their life in the first place.

30:08.130 --> 30:09.006
And...

30:10.300 --> 30:12.928
maybe it's a good idea, so...

30:15.060 --> 30:16.220
[Justin crying]

30:18.440 --> 30:19.259
Are you...

30:20.690 --> 30:22.066
-Are you crying?
-[sniffles]

30:24.230 --> 30:26.232
You know I'm, like,
really fucked up, right?

30:28.280 --> 30:31.113
Well... A, yes.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.732
-[laughs]
-But you're clean and going to meetings.

30:34.910 --> 30:39.825
And B, I'm also fucked up
in certain ways, so...

30:45.090 --> 30:46.079
Okay, yeah.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.927
I'd like to be adopted, yeah.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.137
Okay. Cool.

31:11.110 --> 31:13.066
[Clay] Everything affects everything.

31:13.370 --> 31:15.019
[school bell rings]

31:15.120 --> 31:17.031
Everyone affects everyone.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.111
[chatter]

31:26.000 --> 31:27.547
[sighs]

31:28.670 --> 31:30.467
Fucking Tyler Down is back.

31:31.220 --> 31:32.084
So?

31:32.970 --> 31:34.961
So, I wanna break his head open.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.217
Yeah, that's a great idea
at this particular time.

31:38.770 --> 31:41.227
The field, the thing with Marcus...

31:41.310 --> 31:43.517
He cost us our season.
We need to do something.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.510
We are not gonna do a goddamn thing.

31:46.270 --> 31:47.430
I'm on probation.

31:48.070 --> 31:50.482
Right, I know. I got you.
I'll take care of it.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.738
Your father didn't beat you hard enough,
'cause you're still a fucking idiot.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.249
The last time you tried to help,
you almost fucked up my whole plea deal.

31:59.410 --> 32:00.866
Well, none of it came back to you.

32:00.960 --> 32:04.168
No one was gonna believe I didn't know
about all the shit that you did.

32:04.250 --> 32:06.161
I had to give you my goddamn lavwer.

32:06.670 --> 32:09.912
I would've taken the fall ifI had to.
I kept you clean.

32:10.800 --> 32:13.883
What did you think would happen
if you killed Clay Jensen in my car?

32:13.970 --> 32:16.928
I knew those kids could
fuck everything up for us, and they did.

32:17.470 --> 32:18.846
Well, you helped.

32:21.480 --> 32:25.018
I... Tell me what you want me to do.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.317
-Okay? I'll make it right.
-I want you to leave it alone.

32:30.190 --> 32:31.430
And leave me alone.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.059
We're done.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.917
[Cyrus] Mack said you guys
had a good talk.

32:50.960 --> 32:53.713
Yeah. She's dating Eric now, huh?

32:56.680 --> 32:57.544
Yeah, that's cool.

32:58.300 --> 32:59.130
You're okay, right?

32:59.510 --> 33:01.671
I mean, watching out for yourself?

33:02.230 --> 33:05.131
Those fucking jocks were not happy
about the field and the season.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.430
-Yeah. I'll be careful.
-Good.

33:09.610 --> 33:10.429
And you know...

33:12.400 --> 33:13.230
about everything...

33:13.610 --> 33:16.101
Yeah. No, me, too. Yeah.

33:16.610 --> 33:19.192
-It got a little fucked up.
-[chuckles] Yeah, totally.

33:20.490 --> 33:21.320
Hey.

33:22.410 --> 33:26.289
You know, being away,
it was really good.

33:27.250 --> 33:29.832
And I realized a lot of shit, so...

33:30.090 --> 33:31.660
-You know.
-That's good, man.

33:31.750 --> 33:34.378
-[chuckles]
-So, we're all right?

33:34.800 --> 33:35.789
Yeah, for sure.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.336
-Cool. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.001
Hey, maybe we could catch
another show sometime.

33:42.140 --> 33:43.516
I don't know, man. I...

33:45.310 --> 33:46.129
I don't think so.

33:47.480 --> 33:51.439
But it's great to see that you're back
and doing so well.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.270
Yeah. Thanks, man.

33:56.570 --> 33:58.447
I mean, how are you even not crazy?

33:58.530 --> 33:59.861
I just... [groans]

34:00.870 --> 34:04.158
It's insane,
but it's, like, not a surprise, I guess.

34:04.620 --> 34:07.032
And I-I just feel this peace
that it's over.

34:07.120 --> 34:07.950
So, it's over?

34:08.330 --> 34:10.412
No trial, no more legal stuff?
Done?

34:10.790 --> 34:11.620
Done.

34:13.170 --> 34:14.000
And I'm good.

34:14.880 --> 34:19.214
Oh, what a fine parade

34:20.090 --> 34:24.800
Ready or not, call your name

34:25.180 --> 34:27.842
Hey, now, where do I go?

34:28.640 --> 34:30.301
[Justin sighs]

34:31.860 --> 34:33.179
You gonna go to this dance?

34:35.990 --> 34:37.730
What, the Spring Fling thing?

34:38.860 --> 34:41.408
-Why in the world would I go to that?
-I don't know.

34:41.870 --> 34:43.076
It... It might be fun?

34:43.790 --> 34:44.984
I don't go to dances.

34:46.370 --> 34:47.200
You can go.

34:47.620 --> 34:48.530
No.

34:49.830 --> 34:53.334
I just thought
that it'd be my first thing back

34:53.420 --> 34:59.177
and I could show people
that I'm not, like, hiding or whatever.

35:02.930 --> 35:04.420
[clicks tongue] Forget it.

35:07.560 --> 35:08.379
Fuck.

35:09.390 --> 35:11.802
Fine. [scoffs] We'll go.

35:13.690 --> 35:14.645
[chuckles]

35:15.070 --> 35:19.359
I just thought since I hadn't heard
from you after I told you about Lucas--

35:19.450 --> 35:20.906
Yeah, I left you three messages.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.988
[chuckles] Yeah, and they didn't sound
like you really wanted me to call back.

35:25.080 --> 35:27.196
Okay, okay. Seriously?

35:27.950 --> 35:29.827
I think you're used to people chasing you.

35:30.710 --> 35:32.621
And you're used to getting away.

35:35.420 --> 35:36.239
Maybe.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.588
Well, you're not getting away.

35:48.810 --> 35:49.799
I should be on my way.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.549
Thank you for coming.

35:53.650 --> 35:57.973
Thank you for... for having us.

35:58.820 --> 36:00.811
I saw the store's for lease.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.151
I'm moving to New York.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.617
It was always Hannah's dream.

36:05.700 --> 36:09.079
She never made it,
so I'll get there for her.

36:10.960 --> 36:11.779
I...

36:14.920 --> 36:18.242
I wasn't sure
if I should share this with you,

36:18.340 --> 36:20.410
but after hearing
what you said, I think...

36:22.090 --> 36:23.170
I think it's all right.

36:31.430 --> 36:35.434
I found it on one of the old computers
when I was cleaning up the store.

36:39.110 --> 36:40.020
Hannah wrote it.

36:53.830 --> 36:54.956
"Reasons why not."

36:56.080 --> 36:57.069
You're on there.

36:57.540 --> 37:00.919
At least once, possibly twice.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.831
Did... did she call you "Helmet"?

37:06.720 --> 37:08.347
[chuckles] Yeah, she did.

37:13.430 --> 37:14.590
Eleven reasons.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.051
She came up just short.

37:19.230 --> 37:21.471
But she left so many out.
You know that, don't you?

37:21.780 --> 37:26.524
No matter how many reasons
there might be "why,"

37:27.370 --> 37:28.814
there are always more "why not."

37:30.490 --> 37:31.320
I do.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.957
I wish I knew you when she was alive.

37:48.550 --> 37:50.040
I wish you'd known me then, too.

37:53.100 --> 37:53.919
Well...

37:56.100 --> 37:56.930
bye.

37:58.810 --> 37:59.640
Bye.

38:13.540 --> 38:14.495
[door opens]

38:17.710 --> 38:19.780
Why the fuck did you come back?

38:23.000 --> 38:24.206
I finished my program.

38:26.050 --> 38:27.836
Yeah, you fucked up a lot of shit.

38:31.680 --> 38:32.965
I'm sorry about everything.

38:34.470 --> 38:37.268
-If I hurt you in any way--
-They canceled our fucking season.

38:39.020 --> 38:41.477
I was acting out of a lot of anger
and confusion.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.266
-Oh, yeah?
-And I'm going to do better.

38:43.730 --> 38:45.982
And I hope that we can learn
to talk to each other--

38:46.280 --> 38:48.441
[grunting]

38:49.070 --> 38:51.948
God! You ruined
my fucking life, faggot!

38:53.030 --> 38:53.860
Get up!

38:54.450 --> 38:56.691
-[water bubbling]
-[groaning]

38:57.290 --> 38:59.576
[gasps] I'm sorry!
Please, I'm sorry!

39:01.210 --> 39:02.029
Hold him!

39:03.540 --> 39:05.337
[gasping] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39:09.260 --> 39:11.046
[groans]

39:11.680 --> 39:13.386
[screams]

39:15.470 --> 39:16.459
[shrieks]

39:28.690 --> 39:30.738
[panﬁng]

39:30.990 --> 39:33.117
[door opens]

39:34.950 --> 39:35.780
[door closes]

39:45.290 --> 39:46.450
[Clay] We can get better.

39:47.210 --> 39:48.256
We can do better.

39:49.590 --> 39:52.969
_ But we still live in a world_
that is out to break us any way it can.

39:54.850 --> 39:57.216
-Yo, so how's the car?
-It's getting pretty close.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.670
I've been working on it
every hour I'm not in school

39:59.770 --> 40:01.260
and some when I should be in school.

40:01.350 --> 40:04.433
[chuckles] It was a beautiful car.
Hey, why don't we go to your place?

40:05.730 --> 40:08.563
-All right?
-I think your place is closer.

40:09.030 --> 40:10.429
I'm in the opposite direction.

40:12.490 --> 40:14.902
-You don't want me to meet your family.
-It's not that.

40:15.700 --> 40:16.769
I just need some time.

40:17.740 --> 40:19.651
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow?

40:20.580 --> 40:23.743
Um, you know, I got some bullshit
I gotta take care of.

40:23.830 --> 40:25.206
Oh, some bullshit, like a dance?

40:26.750 --> 40:29.082
Yeah, Alex and Jess are going.
It's like a thing.

40:29.170 --> 40:30.967
-Yeah, you see, that's bullshit.
-[laughs]

40:31.050 --> 40:33.177
And I didn't wanna
subject you to it, so...

40:33.260 --> 40:34.249
I appreciate that.

40:34.550 --> 40:35.380
[chuckles]

40:36.050 --> 40:38.098
-You'l| come by after?
-Yes.

40:40.640 --> 40:45.225
[Alex] And my mom got me some game
that's about being a flower or some shit.

40:45.310 --> 40:47.107
-[laughs]
-I'm serious. [chuckles]

40:47.190 --> 40:50.682
But I talked my dad into driving
since he won't let me drive for real yet.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.948
-Excellent use of guilt, sir.
-Yeah, I thought so.

40:55.110 --> 40:56.907
I beat off three times this morning.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.156
I don't wanna know that.
Why would you tell me?

41:00.330 --> 41:01.991
'Cause I thought you'd be happy for me.

41:04.420 --> 41:08.129
Actually, I-I'm very happy for you.
That's, uh, impressive.

41:08.420 --> 41:09.296
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

41:11.380 --> 41:14.292
I'm worried about dancing with Jess.

41:15.180 --> 41:19.002
Like, I-I don't wanna go to the dance
and just sit there, 'cause that's stupid.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.175
And it doesn't get me closer
to kissing her.

41:21.270 --> 41:24.262
So I wanna dance with her,
but I think I'll just fall over.

41:24.690 --> 41:27.978
No, just, um, lean on her.

41:28.230 --> 41:31.108
What, like, a middle school slow dance?
That's so dumb.

41:31.190 --> 41:34.603
No. Just, you know, like, let her help.
Make it seem smooth.

41:35.030 --> 41:37.407
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

41:38.370 --> 41:40.486
You know, I am sick
of your "poor-me" attitude.

41:40.580 --> 41:43.287
-[car screeches, crashes]
-This one's easy. Come on, get up.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.321
No. This is embarrassing.

41:47.000 --> 41:47.989
This is embarrassing?

41:48.710 --> 41:50.871
-Yeah.
-Yeah, okay, you've done worse.

41:51.590 --> 41:53.501
Come on, put the controller down.
Let's go.

41:54.300 --> 41:55.836
Come on. [grunts]

41:56.760 --> 41:58.330
I have to school you...

42:00.720 --> 42:03.803
-Okay.
-My mom made me do some dance...

42:03.970 --> 42:05.847
Don't-- Never mind.
Don't even worry about that.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.976
So, good hand on her waist.

42:08.810 --> 42:11.472
-Left hand on her hip.
-Yeah.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.891
She'll hold it and just lean into her.

42:14.280 --> 42:16.271
-Okay?
-What about--?

42:16.570 --> 42:18.310
Just try stepping. There you go.

42:18.860 --> 42:19.986
All the way in there.

42:20.910 --> 42:21.729
Yeah.

42:22.580 --> 42:23.399
See?

42:23.990 --> 42:26.242
The song will have to be pretty slow,
shouldn't it?

42:26.910 --> 42:29.322
[footsteps approaching]

42:29.420 --> 42:31.957
So, it turns out the sushi place
doesn't in fact deliver,

42:32.040 --> 42:34.588
so my dad and I are gonna pick it up.
You wanna come?

42:36.510 --> 42:38.080
Nah, I'm... I'm good here.

42:39.800 --> 42:41.176
These are kind of addictive.

42:41.430 --> 42:42.636
[chuckles] Yeah, right?

42:45.890 --> 42:46.720
You okay?

42:48.520 --> 42:49.430
You seem weird.

42:50.810 --> 42:51.720
Ithink, maybe...

42:54.400 --> 42:55.219
I'm happy.

42:56.360 --> 42:57.179
Oh.

42:58.900 --> 42:59.730
Cool.

43:01.410 --> 43:03.776
Running around

43:08.960 --> 43:14.296
Is it really this fun
When you're on my mind?

43:19.050 --> 43:24.499
Is it really this cool
To be in your life?

43:29.140 --> 43:31.552
There's one thing I'll do

43:34.060 --> 43:36.608
If it ever goes wrong

43:38.570 --> 43:43.985
I'll write you into all of my songs

43:51.710 --> 43:54.747
And if suddenly I die

43:56.880 --> 43:58.871
I hope they will say

44:01.880 --> 44:06.465
That he was obsessed
And it was okay

44:11.890 --> 44:17.226
'Cause we're going downtown

44:27.030 --> 44:31.990
And we feel like running around

44:35.080 --> 44:38.493
And I'm going crazy

44:39.840 --> 44:43.048
Crazy for you

44:43.760 --> 44:47.344
Well? How was the first day back?

44:48.010 --> 44:49.966
Good. It was good.

44:50.060 --> 44:53.382
It was, um... like, I had to adjust
to everything, but it was great.

44:53.890 --> 44:57.269
Yeah, there's a new guidance counselor,
and she's totally smart, so...

44:59.480 --> 45:01.687
-I think it's gonna work, Mom.
-That's great.

45:02.570 --> 45:04.652
Oh, that's so great, Tyler.

45:07.120 --> 45:09.441
Oh. We are so proud of you.

45:20.090 --> 45:20.909
[groans]

45:22.210 --> 45:23.211
[pants]

45:25.430 --> 45:26.465
[crying]

45:45.530 --> 45:48.363
Now bring that around to the right.
No, no, no, the big end.

45:49.120 --> 45:50.735
-The big end.
-That's what I'm doing.

45:50.830 --> 45:52.991
That's not what you're doing.
Oh, my God, start over.

45:53.080 --> 45:56.208
-[scoffs] Would you fucking relax?
-You-- You don't listen!

45:57.370 --> 45:58.701
You are so uptight.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.707
I am not uptight.
It was your idea that we should wear ties.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.119
It's not even a formal dance.

46:03.210 --> 46:06.008
And if you wanna wear a tie,
you should follow my instructions.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.216
We really need to get you laid.

46:10.800 --> 46:12.597
Shut up. Start over.

46:13.930 --> 46:15.227
Seriously, Jensen.

46:15.480 --> 46:18.017
Okay? You help me tie a tie,
I will help you get laid.

46:18.440 --> 46:19.475
I don't need your help.

46:20.270 --> 46:23.182
_ I-- I know. _
I was just... I was just saying.

46:26.990 --> 46:28.309
I mean, you've had, like,

46:29.740 --> 46:31.526
a lot of sex, haven't you?

46:32.240 --> 46:35.289
Yeah, I've... I've had a good amount.

46:40.210 --> 46:44.749
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Every second counts

46:46.470 --> 46:48.040
[Clay] So, how do we survive?

46:48.800 --> 46:51.928
How do we bring light
to a world that seems only dark?

46:53.760 --> 46:57.139
This is the first dance
I haven't DJ'd in two years.

46:57.810 --> 46:59.186
So now you get to dance.

46:59.440 --> 47:01.726
Dude, people become DJs
so they don't have to dance.

47:02.610 --> 47:04.976
I thought it was because you had
great taste in music.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.770
That's just my gift to the world.

47:40.560 --> 47:43.973
[music playing]

47:50.360 --> 47:51.270
Good evening.

47:52.610 --> 47:53.440
[laughs]

47:54.160 --> 47:56.446
Good evening.
Did-- Did you do this?

47:57.370 --> 47:59.747
I got him a guest pass.
Apparently, you forgot to.

48:04.170 --> 48:06.035
I didn't go to dances when I was in school

48:06.130 --> 48:08.166
because I felt so awkward
dancing with girls.

48:09.210 --> 48:11.678
It may seem like high school bullshit
to you, but to me,

48:11.760 --> 48:14.001
it's finally being able
to dance with my boyfriend.

48:15.100 --> 48:15.998
If he will.

48:16.390 --> 48:17.379
Of course I will.

48:18.020 --> 48:20.136
-After bitching about the DJ.
-[laughs]

48:23.980 --> 48:25.356
Yeah, me, too.

48:25.440 --> 48:27.431
[chattering]

48:27.770 --> 48:28.600
[Alex] Hey.

48:29.280 --> 48:30.099
Hey.

48:33.820 --> 48:34.775
You guys look good.

48:35.450 --> 48:37.406
Thanks.
Yeah, I bedazzled the cane, so...

48:39.330 --> 48:40.240
I didn't, really.

48:40.580 --> 48:42.457
Well, if we have to do this, let's do it.

48:43.620 --> 48:44.496
Okay.

48:45.000 --> 48:45.876
All right.

48:45.960 --> 48:46.995
-You ready?
-Yep.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.375
All right. [laughs]

48:50.760 --> 48:54.218
I'm living inside my head

48:55.890 --> 48:59.428
I'm living inside my head

49:01.850 --> 49:04.057
-Tony. Caleb. Hey!
-Hey, what's up?

49:04.140 --> 49:06.051
-Hi. This is Tamika.
-Hey, Tamika.

49:06.150 --> 49:06.969
-Hi, Tamika.
-Hi.

49:07.060 --> 49:07.970
She's my girlfriend.

49:08.070 --> 49:09.856
-[gasp51
-[laughs] Oh.

49:09.940 --> 49:12.181
[music continues]

49:30.840 --> 49:33.547
Light it up just like a flashlight

49:34.680 --> 49:35.544
Let it shine

49:35.630 --> 49:37.177
You sure you don't wanna sit down?

49:37.640 --> 49:40.712
No, I don't wanna sit. I wanna dance.
I just need to work up to it.

49:41.390 --> 49:44.473
-You want a drink?
-You know they're non-alcoholic.

49:44.560 --> 49:46.300
Yeah, but any chance for sugar.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.608
It feels good to be
Running from the devil

49:50.110 --> 49:51.350
Another breath

49:51.440 --> 49:53.271
You would've been really good for Hannah.

49:54.700 --> 49:55.769
I'm just saying.

49:57.320 --> 50:01.359
Yeah? You know, if I didn't fuck it up
like I fuck up everything else.

50:02.160 --> 50:04.993
Dude, you do not wanna be having
that contest with me.

50:05.080 --> 50:07.071
["Rollercoaster" playing]

50:08.960 --> 50:10.871
I'm really sorry you couldn't talk to me.

50:13.340 --> 50:15.001
Come on. _
We gotta go in for this one!

50:15.090 --> 50:17.001
Okay, but it's full contact.

50:17.220 --> 50:18.676
This dance desperately needs it.

50:18.760 --> 50:20.170
-Yeah!
-Fuck this. Let's go.

50:22.640 --> 50:25.677
Jensen, come on.
Are you about kicking ass or are you not?

50:26.770 --> 50:27.589
I'm...

50:28.440 --> 50:30.977
It was summer when I saw your face

50:32.110 --> 50:32.929
Iam.

50:35.320 --> 50:36.139
I totally am.

50:37.360 --> 50:39.817
Some killer queen you are

50:40.280 --> 50:41.110
Hey, come on.

50:43.830 --> 50:46.822
If Jeff Atkins were here, he'd say,
"Get your asses up and come on."

50:49.620 --> 50:52.168
Guys, come on! Come on!

50:52.250 --> 50:54.377
So come a little closer

50:55.130 --> 50:57.257
There is something I can tell ya

50:58.130 --> 51:00.928
You are such a rollercoaster

51:01.180 --> 51:04.092
And a killer queen you are

51:10.560 --> 51:12.767
[Clay] How can we find joy in our lives...

51:13.980 --> 51:15.390
in this world after Hannah?

51:16.150 --> 51:18.106
Come a little closer

51:20.280 --> 51:24.239
Why don't you come a little closer?

51:27.700 --> 51:29.952
Why don't you come a little closer?

51:31.000 --> 51:32.956
There's something I can tell ya

51:34.040 --> 51:35.746
Compared to them, I look all right.

51:36.670 --> 51:38.877
Some killer queen you are

51:38.970 --> 51:42.212
Rollercoaster, I don't say no

51:42.800 --> 51:44.882
[Clay] How do we take what hurts most?

51:46.100 --> 51:49.228
Take the darkness and turn it into light?

51:50.810 --> 51:53.768
Rollercoaster, I don't say no

51:53.860 --> 51:56.476
Rollercoaster, when you don't say no

51:56.570 --> 51:58.561
[Clay] I think the answer is
we love each other.

52:00.490 --> 52:03.732
Some killer queen you are

52:06.910 --> 52:07.899
[Clay] Easy to say.

52:08.830 --> 52:10.707
But what do we do when it's hard to love?

52:22.050 --> 52:24.792
She thinks I've got a heart of stone

52:26.430 --> 52:30.389
Because I left her all alone
Lonely tonight

52:30.680 --> 52:33.342
She thinks I'm gonna break her heart

52:35.900 --> 52:36.969
You want a real drink?

52:40.190 --> 52:41.487
No, thanks. I'm good.

52:44.160 --> 52:47.698
I don't have those emotions in me

52:49.290 --> 52:52.612
-[Bryce] Brings back memories, huh?
-I heard you were transferring.

52:53.620 --> 52:54.450
Yeah.

52:55.330 --> 52:56.581
Yeah, I'm gonna start over.

52:58.880 --> 52:59.790
Luclq you.

53:03.970 --> 53:05.176
I'm gonna miss this.

53:07.510 --> 53:08.340
All of it.

53:13.230 --> 53:14.515
You remember freshman year?

53:14.850 --> 53:16.977
The night before our first day,
you stayed over.

53:18.110 --> 53:21.523
We stayed up talking about how we were
gonna be kings of this fucking school.

53:24.360 --> 53:25.236
Yeah, I remember.

53:27.660 --> 53:28.775
I'll always remember.

53:33.580 --> 53:34.456
Me, too, brother.

53:39.540 --> 53:40.370
[Clay] Justin.

53:43.420 --> 53:45.547
-You okay?
-[Bryce] He's fine.

53:46.550 --> 53:49.758
I can't touch him.
Or you, or I go to jail.

53:50.930 --> 53:52.807
Funny. I don't have that problem.

53:53.100 --> 53:54.590
[chuckles]

53:56.350 --> 53:57.647
You're a good kid, Clay.

53:58.060 --> 54:00.608
You need to get laid,
but you're a good kid.

for a quick minute, okay?

For a trail to follow

To the night we met

Oh, take me back to the night we met

56:47.860 --> 56:53.480
When the night was full of terrors

56:55.120 --> 57:00.114
And your eyes were filled with tears

57:02.370 --> 57:07.581
When you had not touched me yet

Oh, take me back to the night we met

What's with these mats?

They must have had
a wrestling meet yesterday.

Wait, we have a wrestling team?

58:27.330 --> 58:30.208
-You were a cheerleader.
-Not for the wrestling team.

58:31.460 --> 58:33.087
And I was a shitty cheerleader.

58:34.670 --> 58:35.625
Yeah, you were.

-What? You said it.
-Still.

58:46.140 --> 58:47.266
You look beautiful.

58:50.980 --> 58:51.799
Sorry.

-Yes.

would wanna do that, I don't know.

We need to call the cops.

-Agreed.
-If we do, his life is over.

His life is over either way.
He's either going to jail or he's dead.

-Don't.

a terrible mistake,

what do we do?

1:02:04.010 --> 1:02:05.295
Justin, find Jessica.

1:02:05.380 --> 1:02:08.087
Get everyone you can.
Lock the doors, stay inside.

1:02:08.430 --> 1:02:09.590
And don't call the police.

1:02:09.930 --> 1:02:10.885
I gotta find Tony.

1:02:12.140 --> 1:02:13.550
What the fuck? Clay!

1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:18.936
[Clay] Do we look the other way?

1:02:19.860 --> 1:02:22.351
Do we just protect ourselves
or do we help them?

1:02:26.700 --> 1:02:29.066
Do we do whatever we can
to save them?

1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:35.361

what Hannah would want us to do.

1:02:43.340 --> 1:02:44.159
what are you doing?

1:02:44.670 --> 1:02:45.500
[trunk closes]

1:02:51.180 --> 1:02:52.807
Get out of here, Clay. Go home.

1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:55.801
No. No, I...

1:02:56.180 --> 1:02:57.761
Don't... Don't do this, Tyler.

1:03:00.730 --> 1:03:02.015
You need to leave right now.

1:03:02.730 --> 1:03:06.109
[stammers] Tyler, please, listen to me.
You don't wanna do this.

1:03:06.490 --> 1:03:07.479
I... I know you don't.

1:03:08.780 --> 1:03:10.611
You don't fucking know anything about me.

1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:14.288
No. No, I do.
I do know because I hurt, too.

1:03:14.740 --> 1:03:17.402
I'm pissed off.
I didn't realize how bad it was for you.

1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:18.910
And I'm sorry that I didn't.

1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:20.285
-[Justin] Clay!
-I should've--

1:03:20.370 --> 1:03:21.667
Hey, g-go back inside.

1:03:21.750 --> 1:03:23.798
-Jesus, Clay!
-Go inside!

1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:27.211
Get out of my fucking way.

1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:29.791
Tyler, please. Don't do it.

1:03:31.260 --> 1:03:33.342
-I have to.
-No, you don't have to.

1:03:34.890 --> 1:03:35.800
You can turn around.

1:03:36.390 --> 1:03:39.052
-You can go home.
-[police siren wailing]

1:03:40.850 --> 1:03:42.181
Everybody knows already.

1:03:42.360 --> 1:03:44.567
The only people that know
are people who know you,

1:03:44.650 --> 1:03:45.969
and they wanna help you.

1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:48.730
-Bullshit.
-No, look.

1:03:49.450 --> 1:03:51.941
[stammers] Tyler, they know
you're hurting, we all are.

1:03:52.030 --> 1:03:54.442
And I don't know what to do
about it, either.

1:03:55.030 --> 1:03:56.657
Okay? I tried hurting other people.

1:03:56.740 --> 1:03:59.368
I tried hurting you,
and it didn't fucking help, man.

1:04:00.250 --> 1:04:02.457
It doesn't do any good.
Listen to me. It doesn't!

1:04:02.540 --> 1:04:05.282
[sirens approaching]

1:04:06.210 --> 1:04:08.508
Tyler, listen.
You don't get out of this alive.

1:04:08.590 --> 1:04:09.875
And I don't want you to die.

1:04:18.140 --> 1:04:19.596
I-I don't want you to die.

1:04:26.730 --> 1:04:28.561
If you think this is the way,

1:04:29.780 --> 1:04:31.987
if you really think
this'll change a goddamn thing

1:04:32.610 --> 1:04:34.566
and not just be another fucking tragedy

1:04:34.660 --> 1:04:37.402
that adults cry about for a week
and then forget,

1:04:37.490 --> 1:04:39.697
if you really think
this is gonna be different,

1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:46.080
then do what you gotta do.

1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:57.589
Come on, Tyler.

1:05:05.020 --> 1:05:05.850
Please?

1:05:12.740 --> 1:05:14.310
There's nothing else I can do.

1:05:21.250 --> 1:05:22.069
There is.

1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:26.240
We'll figure it out.

1:05:27.290 --> 1:05:28.120
Okay?

1:05:31.340 --> 1:05:32.329
I swear.

1:05:45.770 --> 1:05:46.839
[tires screeching]

1:05:47.400 --> 1:05:49.356
-What the fuck?
-That's Tony. It's okay.

1:05:49.570 --> 1:05:50.719
It's Tony. We're gonna go.

1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:53.099
Get in the car!

1:05:53.400 --> 1:05:54.230
Let me help you.

1:05:54.740 --> 1:05:55.855
Come on. It's okay.

1:05:56.950 --> 1:05:57.939
Fuck. Go, come on.

1:05:58.120 --> 1:05:59.155
Come on. Get in the car.

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:04.707
[tires squealing]

1:06:04.790 --> 1:06:05.609
[Jessica] Clay!

1:06:07.460 --> 1:06:08.279
Clay!

1:06:09.710 --> 1:06:11.621
-Fuck.
-[Jessica] Are you okay?

1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:13.619
No.

1:06:13.710 --> 1:06:15.712
[sirens wailing]

1:06:16.880 --> 1:06:18.177
This is fucked up, right?

1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:27.339
Yeah.

1:06:27.980 --> 1:06:33.475
Give me love, give me hope

1:06:33.570 --> 1:06:36.277
-What do we do now?
- Give me strength

1:06:36.360 --> 1:06:41.775
Give me someone to live for

1:06:52.590 --> 1:06:56.879
[man] For help finding crisis resources,

1:06:57.220 --> 1:06:59.541
That I need to survive?

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:06.174
Who will be the life blood
Coursing through my veins?

1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:12.139
Like a river flowing
That will never change

1:07:13.690 --> 1:07:15.897
I need someone

1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:23.901

1:07:59.700 --> 1:08:02.351
I need it now

1:08:10.460 --> 1:08:15.580
Someone write me a letter
I need to know that I'm still alive

1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:21.920
Someone give me a telephone call
I need to hear a human sound

1:08:23.050 --> 1:08:28.215
Someone open up a door
And let me out of this place

1:08:29.270 --> 1:08:32.012
I've been caged up for, oh, so long

1:08:32.810 --> 1:08:39.522
I don't know if I'm living or dying

1:08:46.780 --> 1:08:51.535
