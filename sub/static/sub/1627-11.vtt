I'll talk to Marco.

-Do you think it's still here?
-What are you looking for?

00:34.202 --> 00:36.318
-My book.
-Why did you bury it here?

00:36.871 --> 00:38.236
So my mom doesn't find it.

00:38.623 --> 00:40.204
Hiding it under your mattress
wasn't good enough?

00:40.291 --> 00:42.282
That's the first place
the Evil Queen would look.

00:43.085 --> 00:44.120
EMMA: How about leaving it with me?

00:44.212 --> 00:45.918
That's the second place.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.497
It's still here. Good.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.468
So your mom doesn't know
about the castle?

00:51.677 --> 00:54.214
No. This is our secret.

01:04.523 --> 01:07.230
You know you have a session with
Archie this morning.

01:07.318 --> 01:08.808
I should have known he was with you.

01:08.945 --> 01:11.277
Henry, car, now!

01:12.114 --> 01:13.490
You let him play here?

01:13.783 --> 01:15.239
The storm hit it hard.
But we can fix it.

01:15.326 --> 01:17.157
Well, can you fix a cracked cranium?

01:17.245 --> 01:18.701
'Cause that's what
you'll have on your hands if

01:18.788 --> 01:20.653
one of these boards collapses
under his weight.

01:20.748 --> 01:24.332
You're not thinking about Henry
or his safety, just ways around me.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.628
Miss Swan, don't let your feelings
cloud yourjudgment.

01:28.965 --> 01:30.455
People can get hurt.

01:30.549 --> 01:31.925
What's that supposed to mean?

01:32.134 --> 01:35.922
You're the sheriff now.
It's time to be responsible.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.347
Don't let my feelings
cloud myjudgment?

01:44.438 --> 01:45.689
That's all Regina ever does.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.480
Well, she's just upset because
you and Henry have a special place

01:48.567 --> 01:50.944
and she doesn't.

01:52.238 --> 01:54.399
How did she find out about the castle
in the first place?

01:54.490 --> 01:57.027
She knows everything about this town.
She's the Mayor.

I can grant your wish.

02:21.309 --> 02:25.143
Oh, Sidney. You want a side of bacon
with that whiskey?

02:25.438 --> 02:28.930
You want to show this town
who the Mayor really is? I can help.

02:29.108 --> 02:31.224
It's gonna be kind of hard to do
from inside her pocket.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.059
The Mayor and l are done.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.189
(SCOFFS) Sure you are.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.020
She got me fired from the paper.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.693
She made a fool of me
in the election.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.862
So I started working on an exposé
on the Mayor's office.

02:40.995 --> 02:44.112
And I found something
she didn't want found.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.333
Sidney, you're drunk.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.371

answer to her anymore.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.224
You awakened the Genie of Agrabah!

03:48.104 --> 03:50.516
You're entitled to three wishes.
No more. No less.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.392
But you must know
that magic has its limits.

03:52.775 --> 03:55.016
You cannot wish for life nor death.
You cannot wish for love.

03:55.111 --> 03:57.102
You cannot wish for more wishes.
And once spoken,

03:57.363 --> 04:00.696
a wish cannot be undone,
no matter what the consequences.

04:00.783 --> 04:03.445
So, tell me your first wish.

04:32.690 --> 04:36.808
Life as a genie is
not as magical as it may appear.

So you wish to be free?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.449
More than anything.

04:42.825 --> 04:45.316
Then I know my first wish.

04:45.411 --> 04:47.948
I wish you to be free.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.828
Can it be? Am I truly free?

04:57.006 --> 04:58.997
You are the Genie. You tell me.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.586
There are two more wishes
left in the lamp.

05:01.677 --> 05:02.666
What will you do with them?

05:02.761 --> 05:04.262
For my second wish,

05:07.016 --> 05:10.600
I wish to give my third
and final wish to you.

05:13.689 --> 05:16.772
In my time,
I have granted 1,001 wishes,

05:17.026 --> 05:21.565
and l have seen them end poorly
1,001 times.

05:22.198 --> 05:23.904
Making a wish comes with a price.

05:24.950 --> 05:29.785
And that is why
I will never use this wish.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.687
That was your plan?

15:03.779 --> 15:04.859
I thought you were gonna
do something.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.483
I did. I planted a bug.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.441
You win, Sidney.
Let’s do whatever it takes.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.871
You called for me, Your Majesty?

15:26.009 --> 15:28.375
l have reason to believe

15:29.387 --> 15:33.130
my wife's heart
belongs to another man.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.602
Well, certainly the Queen
would never stray, Your Majesty.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.554
Hmm.

15:44.027 --> 15:48.270
And yet,
her diary suggests othenNise.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.284
QUEEN: Last night,
a man gave me a gift.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.988
And though it was
but a simple mirror,

15:58.083 --> 16:02.167
it awakened feelings in me
that / abandoned long ago.

16:02.295 --> 16:06.254
Hope for love, and companionship,

16:06.341 --> 16:09.048
even though / am
trapped in my husband’s court.

16:12.139 --> 16:16.098
Sadly, the diary does not name
the man who gave her this mirror.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.056
I am not a fool.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.514
I realize that the Queen is unhappy

16:24.359 --> 16:29.319
and yearns for someone to love her
in a way that I never can.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.068
And yet I never imagined

16:33.160 --> 16:35.867
that she would betray me like this.

16:37.831 --> 16:42.825
Well, certainly the Queen
would never act on these feelings.

16:44.045 --> 16:47.037
Love makes people do foolish things.

16:48.884 --> 16:53.127
And why have you called upon me,
Your Majesty?

16:53.638 --> 16:58.302
I need someone with your wits
to learn the identity

16:58.393 --> 17:03.012
of the man who has
stolen my wife's heart.

17:03.899 --> 17:06.641
And what will you do to him
once I have found him?

17:06.735 --> 17:08.896
That is my concern, not yours.

17:11.865 --> 17:15.824
Now, tell me, Genie,

17:16.745 --> 17:21.409
can you find the man
who gave the Queen this mirror,

17:22.584 --> 17:23.869
or not?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.590
REGINA: (ON TAPE)
Miss Ginger, / really don ’t have time for

17:40.685 --> 17:43.017
more complaints about
working conditions.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.595
The air temperature is
not one of my areas.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.981
Scintillating.
Find anything good yet?

17:48.068 --> 17:49.228
Yeah, better than good.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.275
She made this call
a little over an hour ago.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.570
REGINA: I’ll meet you tonight
at Access Road 23

17:54.658 --> 17:55.898
with the rest of your payment.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.952
Yes, it’ll all be in cash.

17:58.328 --> 18:02.446
And / don ’t need to remind you
that no one can know about this.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.288
Yes, / know it has to be tonight.

18:04.709 --> 18:05.698
Who was on the other end?

18:05.794 --> 18:07.125
You bugged the office, not the phone.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.043
-Well, we're just gonna have to find out.
-Yeah.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.041
A payoff in the woods?
That's promising.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.464
A payoff using stolen city funds.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.049
Let's go find out who she's meeting.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.315
Emma?

18:35.282 --> 18:36.647
It won't stop!

18:44.124 --> 18:45.409
(GROANS)

18:45.500 --> 18:46.615
You okay?

18:46.710 --> 18:48.120
Yeah. You?

18:48.712 --> 18:50.452
-Yeah.
-(EXHALES)

18:51.756 --> 18:53.337
(BOTH GRUNTING)

19:03.727 --> 19:05.058
We're gonna miss that hand-off.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.343
Emma.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.469
What?

19:09.024 --> 19:10.309
You know that bug you planted?

19:10.692 --> 19:11.807
I think Regina found it.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.400
Someone's been
tampering with the brakes.

19:15.864 --> 19:16.979
She's on to us.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.148
SIDNEY: Wait!

19:20.243 --> 19:21.699
The bitch tried to have me killed.
I'm finding her.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.989
Let's be cautious.
We need to think clearly.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.115
To hell with caution.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.288
I'm gonna find out what she's doing
and why she's out here.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.115
She was meeting me.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.416
What are you doing out here with her?

19:33.548 --> 19:35.539
Just a little business transaction.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.002
What's in the briefcase?

19:37.594 --> 19:39.755
Everything comes at a price.

19:40.055 --> 19:41.386
Land is no different.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.592
That's why you're meeting her
out here?

19:43.683 --> 19:44.923
Regina bought your land?

19:45.018 --> 19:47.134
The very ground you're standing on.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.386
What does she want it for?

19:49.731 --> 19:53.019
You know, in business, | find it's
best not to ask too many questions.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.566
Hurts the bottom line.

19:55.904 --> 19:56.939
The question is, Emma,

19:57.072 --> 19:59.313
why are you standing out here
in the middle of the night

19:59.741 --> 20:01.197
with Mr. Glass?

20:01.326 --> 20:03.237
You don't know what Regina did to me.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.948
You don't know what
she did to her son.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.779
We can'tjust sit idly by.

20:11.586 --> 20:12.996
Be careful.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.585
Emotional entanglements can
lead us down very dangerous paths.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.812
I was beginning to worry
you wouldn't come.

20:36.444 --> 20:38.230
You were expecting the Queen?

20:38.446 --> 20:41.028
Who are you?
What have you done with her?

20:41.282 --> 20:43.534
The King has locked her away
in her chambers.

20:43.618 --> 20:46.451
My daughter is a prisoner
in her own Kingdom.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.742
You are the Queen's father?

20:50.417 --> 20:52.453
Please, take this to her.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.126
The Palace Guards won't allow me
into her chambers.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.328
They know I'd die for her.

20:57.924 --> 21:01.291
But you. The King trusts you.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.879
He doesn't know
that you have my daughter's heart.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.634
The guards will allow you in.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.389
Give her this box.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.717
Wait, I don't understand.
What is in it?

21:10.812 --> 21:13.349
This is the only thing
that can free her

21:14.274 --> 21:15.810
from this wretched life.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.479
If you truly care for my daughter,

21:19.487 --> 21:23.651
I know you'll do whatever it takes
to set her free.

21:45.847 --> 21:47.462
What are we doing here?

21:47.682 --> 21:50.139
We know she bought land from Gold,
we don't know why.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.477
I'm willing to bet
it's for personal reasons,

21:51.561 --> 21:52.641
but we have to know for sure.

21:52.729 --> 21:54.560
We need documents that officially
link her to that land.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.148
So you want to break into her office?

21:56.524 --> 21:59.641
It's locked and she's got a state of
the art security system and alarm.

21:59.736 --> 22:02.102
If we don't show this town
who Regina really is, who will?

22:02.197 --> 22:04.404
-Do you think you can crack her code?
-Yep.

22:04.491 --> 22:05.480
(ALARM SOUNDING)

22:05.575 --> 22:06.735
Emma!

22:06.826 --> 22:09.863
Who does the alarm system alert?
The police. I'm the police.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.569
Two minutes for her to
get a call from the alarm company,

22:11.664 --> 22:14.280
one minute to get her coat and keys,
three minutes to drive here.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.411
-We got maybe six minutes.
-(SIGHS)

22:20.882 --> 22:22.292
(ALARM CONTIN U ES)

22:25.762 --> 22:27.502
(BEEPING)

22:30.517 --> 22:32.724
I just uncovered every file
that references

22:32.810 --> 22:34.550
the tract of land
she bought from Gold.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.181
Nice!

22:44.739 --> 22:46.275
What the hell do these open?

22:46.366 --> 22:47.401
I don't know.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.822
-What are you doing?
-Looking for Henry's book.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.653
We didn't come here for Henry.
We came here for the files...

22:53.748 --> 22:57.081
No, you didn't come here for Henry.
Me, that's the only reason I'm here.

22:59.796 --> 23:00.956
Oh!

23:02.507 --> 23:03.917
-What are you doing?
-(KEYS BEEPING)

23:04.008 --> 23:05.088
-Some kids broke in.
-(ALARM STOPS)

23:05.176 --> 23:08.668
I heard the alarm so I'm checking it out,
'cause I'm Sheriff.

23:10.265 --> 23:12.256
Well, that was
an awfully quick response time.

23:12.517 --> 23:14.599
You told me to do myjob
and I'm doing it.

23:15.937 --> 23:16.892
And you brought him?

23:16.980 --> 23:18.811
Oh, well, he saw it
while he was on a walk.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.308
So he's a witness.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.560
Mmm.

23:21.651 --> 23:23.107
And what did you see, Sidney?

23:24.445 --> 23:25.946
Some kids with a...

23:26.030 --> 23:27.736
-Rock.
-A rock.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.115
Did they take anything?

23:31.202 --> 23:34.410
I don't know, I'd have to
do a thorough sweep to find out.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.368
It appears to me
it's all just a prank.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.449
You sure you don't want me to
take the place apart?

23:41.254 --> 23:43.711
Sheriff, your services are not wanted
norneeded.

23:43.798 --> 23:44.787
Okay.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.622
Well, you know where to find me.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.645
It's you!

24:09.449 --> 24:10.780
Oh.

24:17.332 --> 24:20.824
My love for you grows stronger
with every beat of my heart.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.665
But the King has read my diary,

24:25.965 --> 24:27.341
found my mirror.

24:27.425 --> 24:30.292
Soon, he will discover
the truth about us.

24:30.428 --> 24:31.838
There is no escape.

24:31.929 --> 24:34.671
There is always an escape.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.185
would give you your freedom.

24:47.862 --> 24:49.693
QUEEN: Yes. I believe it will.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.203
(HISSING)

25:02.543 --> 25:04.329
The Agrabahn viper.

25:05.046 --> 25:07.162
A snake so deadly
it can kill anything.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.542
With a single bite.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.383
This serpent is from my homeland.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.427
I know all too well of its poison.

25:14.555 --> 25:15.965
But why would you
have it brought here?

25:17.892 --> 25:21.134
There is no happiness left for me
in this life.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.519
One small bite,

25:24.065 --> 25:26.807
and I shall be
free from this prison forever.

25:29.904 --> 25:32.646
I'm sorry we couldn't be together,
my love.

25:35.076 --> 25:38.284
Perhaps in another life
we will find each other again.

25:50.633 --> 25:53.966
There is another way.

25:54.971 --> 25:59.681
What if the King didn't live?

26:04.981 --> 26:06.596
You would do that for me?

26:06.941 --> 26:09.478
For you I would do anything.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.481
(SIGHING)

26:15.908 --> 26:18.115
I don't know what I'd do without you.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.951
You will never have to find out.

26:28.463 --> 26:29.828
(HISSING)

26:36.929 --> 26:38.214
What are you working on?

26:38.765 --> 26:40.005
No time to talk.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.839
I got to write it all down
before I forget.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.186
Yeah, I hate it when
great ideas slip away from me.

26:44.395 --> 26:45.931
They're not my ideas.

26:46.022 --> 26:48.513
They're stories from
a book that I lost.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.106
Must be a hell of a book.

26:51.319 --> 26:52.479
What's it about?

26:53.321 --> 26:54.481
Stuff.

26:55.656 --> 26:56.816
Sounds exciting.

26:56.908 --> 26:59.741
You seem awfully interested
in me and my book.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.533
Oh, I'm just being neighborly.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.786
What are you doing in Storybrooke?

27:03.998 --> 27:05.033
I'm a writer.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.079
You can write anywhere.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.907
What are you really doing here?

27:10.171 --> 27:11.160
(WHISPERS) Stuff.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.506
Good luck with the stories.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.968
Blueprints, bank statements...

27:23.059 --> 27:25.095
What is she building out there?

27:25.394 --> 27:26.770
A mansion?

27:26.896 --> 27:28.352
Well, whatever it is,
it doesn't matter.

27:29.023 --> 27:31.230
Because these escrow statements
have her name all over it.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.273
You were right. Personal use.

27:33.361 --> 27:34.976
She's done. We got her.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.947
What's wrong? Didn't you hear me?

27:41.911 --> 27:43.151
We stooped to her level.

27:43.538 --> 27:45.153
That's exactly what
I promised Henry I wouldn't do.

27:45.248 --> 27:46.863
Emma, we got her!

27:47.166 --> 27:48.702
It's fruits of the poisonous tree.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.450
Illegally obtained evidence.

27:50.545 --> 27:52.285
It'll get thrown out in court
in a heartbeat.

27:52.380 --> 27:54.120
No, we don't need her to go to jail.

27:54.215 --> 27:55.295
Then what are we doing here?

27:55.383 --> 27:56.463
What you wished for.

27:56.551 --> 27:58.633
Get everyone to see who she is.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.460
What she did to Henry
she does to everyone.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.677
She destroys what people love.

28:05.101 --> 28:06.887
Oh, let me show you something.

28:19.574 --> 28:21.030
She made me follow you.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.357
She made me tell her everything.

28:23.828 --> 28:26.410
She knew about your secret place
weeks ago.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.079
She just waited to destroy it

28:28.207 --> 28:29.993
till it would hurt
you and Henry the most.

28:31.627 --> 28:32.912
(SIGHS)

28:33.004 --> 28:34.244
It's all my fault.

28:39.510 --> 28:42.422
If you don't do this, I have to.

28:45.433 --> 28:46.513
Okay.

28:49.896 --> 28:52.729
This session of the Storybrooke
City Council will come to order.

28:53.274 --> 28:56.016
We will begin by reading
the minutes from our last meeting.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.101
Excuse me, Madam Mayor.

28:58.738 --> 29:01.605
I have something I'd like to bring to
the Council's attention.

29:02.158 --> 29:04.570
This is not an open forum, Sidney.

29:04.869 --> 29:06.951
And no one on this Council
is interested in hearing

29:07.079 --> 29:09.161
the boozy complaints of
a disgraced reporter.

Now, sit down.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.331
He's not the only one
who has something to say.

29:13.419 --> 29:18.129
Miss Swan, this meeting is to
discuss issues facing Storybrooke.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.669
Like the Mayor stealing
thousands of dollars from the city

29:20.760 --> 29:21.920
to build herself a second home?

29:29.644 --> 29:32.477
Miss Swan, you will sit down
immediately or so help me.

29:32.563 --> 29:33.723
What? You'll punish me?

29:33.814 --> 29:36.146
You'll bully me
like everyone else in this town?

29:36.609 --> 29:39.316
No. Not today.

29:40.029 --> 29:44.693
In my hand I am holding documents
proving that this woman, your Mayor,

29:44.825 --> 29:48.568
stole funds from the city to build herself
a lavish home in the woods.

And this "disgraced reporter,"

29:52.625 --> 29:54.161
you wanna know why
he was really fired?

29:54.251 --> 29:56.833
Because he stood up to her.
Because he questioned her.

29:57.588 --> 30:00.500
We all know what happens to
people who question the Mayor.

30:02.218 --> 30:05.051
You claim that you act
in the best interest of all of us.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.923
But that isn't the truth, is it?

30:07.390 --> 30:09.847
The truth is, you are a thug
that doesn't care about anyone

30:09.934 --> 30:11.595
or anything but yourself.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.592
That is who you really are,

30:14.146 --> 30:16.728
and it's time for the people of
Storybrooke to know that.

30:21.487 --> 30:25.821
You are right, Miss Swan.
I am building a house.

30:31.455 --> 30:32.956
A playhouse.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.790
(ALL MURMURING)

30:37.712 --> 30:41.375
The accusations are true.
I did take city funds.

30:41.882 --> 30:44.874
I wanted to build a playground
so my son Henry,

30:45.553 --> 30:48.295
and all the children of Storybrooke,

30:48.389 --> 30:50.755
could have a special place to play.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.339
Safely.

30:54.145 --> 30:55.976
As for the sketch in your hands,

30:56.230 --> 30:58.812
it was inspired by a drawing I found

30:59.233 --> 31:01.098
in one of my son's books.

31:03.279 --> 31:05.816
So there you have it, Miss Swan.

31:05.906 --> 31:08.739
You've exposed me
for who I really am.

31:10.578 --> 31:12.409
I hope you're satisfied.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.470
You asked me to find the man who
gave the mirror to your Queen.

Idid.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.760
I am that man.

33:02.273 --> 33:04.138
You gave me my freedom.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.724
You gave me a chance to find love

33:06.819 --> 33:09.276
and for that
I am forever in your debt.

33:09.488 --> 33:14.152

so must I now free your Queen.

You know, what you did in there
was commendable, Miss Swan.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.115
But if you really want to bring her down
you're gonna need a strong ally.

34:04.919 --> 34:05.908
Like yourself?

34:06.712 --> 34:08.953
Thanks. But I'm still not interested.

Oh, one can wish.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.672
Miss Swan, a word?

34:17.556 --> 34:18.545
Alone?

34:23.354 --> 34:25.811
I don't know what you were hoping to
accomplish in there,

34:26.440 --> 34:28.601
but now I hope
you'll go back to yourjob,

34:29.193 --> 34:32.401
which is upholding the law,
not breaking it.

you broke into my office?

you're so innocent.

(SCOFFS) Your brakes?

34:41.789 --> 34:42.949
Are you delusional?

34:43.457 --> 34:46.574
Why would I kill you when
you just saw I had nothing to hide?

34:46.669 --> 34:47.875
Nothing I can prove.

34:47.962 --> 34:50.578
Well, until you have
something more substantial

34:50.673 --> 34:53.039
than disdain to throw my way,

34:54.301 --> 34:56.292
you're going to stay away from me.

there's not a judge in the world

after what you've done.

I will find your book.

be traced back to me.
