What did the hospital tell you, Damien?

24:06.737 --> 24:09.699
At Charter Hospital,
I was diagnosed as manic depressive.

24:11.075 --> 24:14.287
I'm in therapy now
and on imipramine for depression.

24:15.288 --> 24:18.499
I'm just curious.
How do you think the killer felt?

24:19.375 --> 24:22.879
They liked it. Happy.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.340
It was a thrill kill.

24:32.263 --> 24:34.765
How about you, Jason?
Did you know the three boys?

24:35.641 --> 24:36.893
No, sir.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.938
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes, I do.

24:41.439 --> 24:44.233
How about you, Damien? You believe in God?

24:45.234 --> 24:46.569
Or the devil?

24:47.862 --> 24:50.406
I believe in a god. A female god.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.951
And an evil force. Not a devil.

24:55.578 --> 24:59.457

When you would go out
to Robin Hood Woods,

25:02.418 --> 25:05.630
-who would you go with?
- With Chris and Michael.

25:06.589 --> 25:09.258
Did you ever see anything out there?

25:10.343 --> 25:13.429

He tried to cut me on my side.

25:37.787 --> 25:38.788
I kicked him.

Then he grabbed my hands
and made me cut Chris.

This is Detective Bryn Ridge
of the West Memphis Police Department,

25:50.132 --> 25:54.554
currently in the office
with Jessie Lloyd Misskelley Junior.

25:56.472 --> 26:01.602
Jessie, on Wednesday,
May 5, 1993, early in the morning,

26:01.644 --> 26:03.729
you received a phone call. Is that correct?

26:04.480 --> 26:07.149
Yeah, I did. Jason Baldwin called me

26:07.191 --> 26:09.569
and he asked if I could go
to West Memphis with him,

26:09.652 --> 26:12.905
and I told him no. I had to work and stuff.

26:12.989 --> 26:16.951
And then he told me that he had to go.
So him and Damien, they went.

26:16.993 --> 26:20.788
Then I went with them up to the...
Up to the Robin Hood.

26:21.581 --> 26:22.748
Jessie and Damien

26:22.832 --> 26:27.378
picked him up and put a bucket
where he was bleeding.

26:27.670 --> 26:30.548
So you saw Damien strike
Chris Byers in the head?

26:30.631 --> 26:32.383
- Right.
- What did he hit him With?

26:32.675 --> 26:35.428
Well, he hit him with his fist
and bruised him all up real bad.

26:35.845 --> 26:38.389
And then Jason, he turned,
and he hit Stevie Branch,

26:38.472 --> 26:41.017
and that's when Michael Moore, he took off.

26:41.058 --> 26:44.687
So I chased him, grabbed him
and held him until they got there.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.356
And then, and that's when I left.

26:47.982 --> 26:49.567
Who had a knife?

26:52.528 --> 26:58.075
Jason. I saw him cut one of those little boys.

Obsession with death. Satanic paraphernalia.
Kidnapping. Sexual abuse.

claims that people who knew Damien said

30:26.659 --> 30:28.911
he dressed in black and carried a cat skull.

30:29.453 --> 30:32.832
It also claims he wears the
number 666 inside his boots.

30:32.915 --> 30:34.875
And then it goes on to quote
two unnamed girls,

30:34.917 --> 30:37.253
one who said she's seen Damien drink blood.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.421

to cut off a boy's head off
and put it on a doorstep.

No. It's hard to believe anyone would confess

He's been in and out of psychiatric wards.

34:04.001 --> 34:06.462

included Jason Baldwin.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.967

34:18.306 --> 34:21.310
- And I worry about that baby.
- Why?

34:22.101 --> 34:24.313
Because of the rumor
that they're going to sacrifice it to Satan.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.438
You're saying you actually believe that?

34:25.481 --> 34:27.649
- You bet I do.
- Come on, Jerry.

All that occult-crime,
Satanic-panic stuff's been studied by the FBI

34:35.991 --> 34:38.702
I know what I've seen with my own two eyes.

34:39.286 --> 34:42.456
And I'm telling you evidence of occult
activity was everywhere that summer.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.252
In this old abandoned schoolhouse...

34:48.212 --> 34:50.630
I mean, Steve Jones saw something.

34:54.426 --> 34:59.098
<i>It's like a picture I'd seen
in a book about the serial killer, Son of Sam.</i>

34:59.306 --> 35:02.518
<i>Like somebody had restaged the scene.</i>

35:04.019 --> 35:07.606
<i>Or re-enacted it. So ever since that summer</i>

35:07.689 --> 35:10.776
<i>I've been telling the local police to watch him.</i>

35:11.610 --> 35:13.278
'Cause I knew something bad
was gonna happen.

35:14.947 --> 35:17.282
I sent Steve Jones over to Damien's house.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.328
<i>And he found all sorts of
crazy stuff in Damien's room.</i>

35:21.703 --> 35:24.039
<i>Evidence of his interest in the occult.</i>

35:28.043 --> 35:30.921

that the local devil worshippers</i>

35:31.004 --> 35:33.465
<i>had reached the end of their
animal sacrifice stage.</i>

35:33.549 --> 35:36.135
<i>And I'm talking about things
they do to receive power.</i>

35:36.677 --> 35:42.141
So that summer, he said they
were gonna take the next logical step.

- He had a lot to say about you.
- I bet.

36:37.571 --> 36:40.616
Said they found a lot of stuff in your room.

36:40.699 --> 36:44.077
- Evidence of your interest in the occult.
- My notebooks.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.206

36:47.956 --> 36:50.709

What about the things you told him?

36:54.504 --> 36:57.549
About devil worshippers
planning on making human sacrifices.

37:00.302 --> 37:02.471
I was just messing with his mind.

37:04.514 --> 37:08.644
That you threatened to eat your father
and out your mother's throat.

37:09.186 --> 37:10.812
Driver's a liar.

37:11.438 --> 37:16.818
It's not just Driver. There's a lot of people
saying things, damaging things.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.155
Listen to this.

37:20.197 --> 37:21.990
Why should I listen to you?

37:22.824 --> 37:25.869
Why should I answer your questions?
Are you my lawyer?

37:26.453 --> 37:28.997
No. I'm working with them.

37:29.831 --> 37:34.962
You're working for them?
What are you, like a lawyer's assistant?

37:36.630 --> 37:38.048
I'm an investigator.

37:39.132 --> 37:41.551
But you won't be representing me in court.

37:42.177 --> 37:45.430
No. No, I'm not allowed to do that.

37:46.390 --> 37:49.268
So I'm just supposed to trust you?
Tell you everything?

37:50.060 --> 37:52.271
If you want me to help you, yes.

37:59.403 --> 38:01.196
Those cops are scary, okay?

38:03.156 --> 38:08.161
They will do anything to get people
to say what they want to hear.

38:11.415 --> 38:14.167
Why would so many people
say all these things about you?

38:14.835 --> 38:18.338
Why did those girls say
people were witches back in Salem?

38:18.880 --> 38:21.133
Any time anything weird
happens around here,

38:21.216 --> 38:23.760
people blame it on devil worshippers.

38:25.095 --> 38:26.346
And on me.

38:31.310 --> 38:35.647
What about the incident when you were
locked up at the JDC in Jonesboro?

38:35.731 --> 38:37.357
They say you drank some kid's blood.

38:37.983 --> 38:41.486
I didn't attack him. He offered it.

38:43.405 --> 38:48.201
I did that with a knife.
That's my girlfriend's name.

38:48.744 --> 38:51.455
I've been cutting myself for a long time.

38:51.538 --> 38:52.831
Why?

38:54.583 --> 38:56.877
There's power in the blood.

Life plus 40? Well, it's fine with me.

59:37.324 --> 59:39.535
It's one down, two to go.

59:39.618 --> 59:42.871
And the good Lord said
Lucifer and a third of the angels

59:42.997 --> 59:45.416
were cast out of heaven. He didn't need 'em.

59:45.499 --> 59:48.711
'Cause he took their minds
and manipulated them.

59:48.794 --> 59:51.839
And they prayed to their Devil
and they prayed to their Satan,

59:51.880 --> 59:55.426
and did all kinds of Satanic worship services.

59:55.509 --> 59:59.013
Wild, crazy orgies, I've been told.

01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:10.024
There's a war going on.

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:15.404
It's a war between Satan,
Lucifer and the Lord.

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:16.488
Mrs. Hobbs?

01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:23.037
TERRY: Hey.

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:30.127
You stay away from us.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:35.841
You don't talk to her. Understand?

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:43.891
You hear me?
You bother my wife, and by God, it's on.

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:47.478
All right, Terry, let's go home.
Come on. Come on.

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:57.821
JOHN: ...and I say bring it on.
For me this place is like hell on Earth.

01:00:58.739 --> 01:01:04.912
'Cause I know three babies were killed.
I know my son was castrated.

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:07.998
And lay on that bank and bled to death.

01:01:08.207 --> 01:01:09.875
I know he was choked.

01:01:14.088 --> 01:01:16.090
How's the documentary coming along?

01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:17.841
Y'all been here every day, right?

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:20.260
Interviewing families. Must be fascinating.

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:26.558
Yeah. We're, uh, getting some
pretty good stuff.

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:30.604
Especially John Mark Byers
seems to like the attention.

01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:32.439
Well, he's not shy, that's for sure.

01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:36.110
Did he ever do or say anything unusual?

01:01:36.819 --> 01:01:41.532
I don't just mean holding
forth for cameras and reporters.

01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:46.578
I mean, like something suspicious or strange?

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:52.459
Yeah. He did do something strange.
Very strange.

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:57.673
He gave this as a gift
to the documentary crew.

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:01.093
So when were you planning
on telling us about it?

01:02:01.427 --> 01:02:04.930
Mr. Fogleman released the
records concerning this knife yesterday.

01:02:06.014 --> 01:02:09.518
But you've known about it for months.
How could you not tell us about it?

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:13.147
Well, we had to send it to the lab first.
DNA testing.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.274
There was blood on the knife.

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:17.484
Just a little bit.

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:21.989
I'll show you right here.
Lock joint where the blade folds back.

01:02:22.448 --> 01:02:23.449
Just not much.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.704
Where you might miss it
if you're trying to wipe the blade clean.

01:02:31.165 --> 01:02:33.167
That did cross my mind.

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:38.338
On January 26, 1994, Gitchell asked
you, "Have you used the knife?"

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.300
And you said, "I never used it.
Hopefully I was going to use it

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:45.012
"for deer hunting, but I never
had the opportunity to use it on a deer."

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:49.892
That's right. But the reason that I said that
was 'cause I never hunted with it.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.604
I didn't mean that I didn't try to use it
to cut some venison.

01:02:54.313 --> 01:02:57.399
Did Inspector Gitchell
tell you, "We found blood on this knife"?

01:02:57.483 --> 01:02:58.567
I don't remember.

01:02:58.734 --> 01:03:01.236
Check your transcript. Page 7.

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:05.032
Now, I'll ask you again. Did Gitchell tell you,

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:08.702
"We found blood on this knife"?

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:10.078
Yes, sir.

01:03:10.162 --> 01:03:13.665
Did Gitchell tell you
the blood on the knife was Chris' blood?

01:03:13.874 --> 01:03:15.542
I don't remember. It might be in here.

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:18.086
Did you tell Gitchell, "I have no idea

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:20.047
"how Chris' blood could be on that knife"?

01:03:20.172 --> 01:03:23.217
Yes, sir. I would not have any idea.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:26.887
Did you have any idea
how human blood was on the knife?

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:30.432
Well, yes. As I was trying to use the knife

01:03:30.516 --> 01:03:33.560
to cut some venison
and make some beef jerky with it,

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:35.646
I cut my thumb.

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:37.731
Mr. Byers, do you recall saying,

01:03:37.815 --> 01:03:41.527
"I don't even remember nicking myself with it
cutting the deer meat or anything"?

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:43.612
- Is that the answer you gave?
- Yes, sir.

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:45.364
And is it the truth?

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:48.700
At the time that he was
questioning me, I didn't...

01:03:48.909 --> 01:03:52.412
I mean, I might not have remembered.

01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:57.459
But then later on in the clay, I could have
remembered and talked to him about it then.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:11.890
You all right, buddy? You did great.

01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:16.270
-(CHURCH BELLS TOLLING)
- JOHN: I wasn't expecting that.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:23.777
I ran and Jessie caught me. Uh, he tied me up.

01:04:25.571 --> 01:04:27.281
How did they tie you up?

01:04:27.573 --> 01:04:28.782
Rope.

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:34.413
<i>Then he grabbed my hands
and made me cut Chris.</i>

01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:41.378
<i>Jessie and Damien picked him up
and put a bucket where he was bleeding.</i>

01:04:42.963 --> 01:04:47.926
<i>Then they poured it in a glass
and made me drink it.</i>

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:55.309
<i>GITCHELL: They poured his blood in</i> a <i>glass
and made you drink it?</i>

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:56.643
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:04:56.727 --> 01:05:00.105
<i>Aaron, you're not... You're
not making this up, are you?</i>

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:01.273
<i>No.</i>

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:03.483
<i>- I mean, you and I are buddies, right?
-Yeah.</i>

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:06.486
<i>We're buddies. You wouldn't be
telling me a story, would you?</i>

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:07.654
<i>No.</i>

01:05:07.738 --> 01:05:09.865
<i>How do I know that you're
telling me the truth?</i>

01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:13.035
I don't know.

01:05:13.327 --> 01:05:15.996
Good afternoon. My name's Ron Lax.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:18.123
I'm an investigator working with the attorneys

01:05:18.165 --> 01:05:21.668
who represent Damien Echols
and Jason Baldwin.

01:05:24.004 --> 01:05:29.009
Um, please, I can't talk to you. Okay?

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.720
I don't want to get involved.

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:35.098
Mrs. Hutcheson, you're already involved.

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:37.935
You feature prominently
in the prosecution's case.

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.603
And from what I can tell,
you're the only real link

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:42.731
between Jessie Misskelley
and Damien Echols.

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:46.777
No.
(CHUCKLES) No, I can't talk about it.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:50.614
You gotta ask Don.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.866
- Detective Donald Bray?
- Yes.

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:59.748
Yes, he... You just ask Don.
I gotta go now, I'm sorry.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.877
So why did Vicki Hutcheson come see you?
Was she in trouble?

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:09.216
She, uh, looked to be part of a credit card
scam at a truck stop where she worked.

01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:10.425
So I called her in.

01:06:11.093 --> 01:06:15.055
She brought her kid in
the day after those boys went missing.

01:06:16.682 --> 01:06:22.062
I just wanted to let you know
that my boy, Aaron,

01:06:22.104 --> 01:06:24.231
is a close friend of them missing boys.

01:06:24.523 --> 01:06:28.026
Michael Moore and Chris Byers
are his two best friends.

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:31.655
You think you might know something
to help the police find them boys?

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:37.077
I'd say it's very possible. Right, honey?
It is possible.

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:41.373
We questioned Aaron.
He told us about the meetings in the woods.

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:45.043
It made sense to me.
I already knew about the Satanic cult.

01:06:45.836 --> 01:06:47.462
You knew about the cult?

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:51.925
We been expecting something like this
to happen around here for quite a while.

01:06:52.968 --> 01:06:54.803
How did you confirm Aaron's story?

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:56.304
Questioned Vicki.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:01.101
Asked her if there was anything she knew
about an occult or devil worshippers.

01:07:01.143 --> 01:07:02.769
She said no.

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:06.440
But then she said,
"How about I go play detective

01:07:07.024 --> 01:07:09.359
"to see what I can find out?"

01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:10.986
<i>VICKI: Jessie!</i>

01:07:14.156 --> 01:07:17.868
You're a real sweetie to come over here today
and do this in this heat.

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:22.622
It's all right.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.464
Do you know that boy, Damien Echols?

01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:33.091
Yeah. He's kind of weird.

01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:34.134
Mmm.

01:07:36.595 --> 01:07:40.098
Well, I really want to meet him.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:44.311
Do you think you could fix us up?

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:47.522
(HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING)

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:49.149
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:07:49.191 --> 01:07:50.901
JESSIE: Vicki!

01:07:55.781 --> 01:07:59.076
Vicki, this is Jason Baldwin
and Damien Echols.

01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:03.997
Come on in, boys. Let's have a drink.

01:08:04.456 --> 01:08:07.959
Thanks, Jessie. I'll see you around.

01:08:10.545 --> 01:08:14.800
I told Damien that I want
to learn more about Satanism.

01:08:14.883 --> 01:08:20.096
And, um, and he invited me to an esbat.

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:23.183
What the hell is that?

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:27.354
I had to look it up. It's a...
It's a gathering of witches.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:32.024
It was in an open field, under the full moon.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:36.279
Damien drove me there in his car,
it was a red Ford Escort.

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:38.990
So me, Damien and Jessie...

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:46.206
<i>The people were dressed all in black,
and you couldn't see their faces.</i>

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:49.751
<i>- And they started to undress each other.
-(CHANTING)</i>

01:08:53.505 --> 01:08:56.383
<i>And I asked Damien to drive me home.</i>

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:58.718
<i>I couldn't stay 'cause I was so afraid.</i>

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:02.305
You were afraid. Afraid for your life?

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:04.640
Yes, sir.

01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:08.478
(CHANTING)

01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:28.747
LAX: <i>I'm sorry but that sounds
like</i> a <i>load of crap.</i>

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:31.792
Damien's got no license.
He doesn't even drive.

01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:34.712
None of his friends or family
have a red Ford Escort.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.215
I'm just telling you what she told me.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:40.260
And the esbat seemed to fit
what Aaron had been telling us.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:44.430
About people painted black,
chanting, doing what men and women do.

01:09:44.598 --> 01:09:47.100
But did you ever
find any evidence to corroborate

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:48.768
these tales Aaron and Vicki told you?

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:50.812
Or anything that would link
these murders to Damien?

01:09:50.937 --> 01:09:54.941
No physical evidence.
But we got something else.

01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:56.943
We got Jessie's confession.

01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:00.363
So Vicki's plan failed, right?

01:10:00.447 --> 01:10:03.700
Damien gave her nothing.
He never said anything that implicated them.

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:07.746
Yeah, but Vicki's plan got Jessie involved,
which led him right into the lion's den.

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:09.664
They got their confession from him instead.

01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:13.293
And Jason Baldwin gets caught
in the net just by picking the wrong friend.

01:10:13.335 --> 01:10:15.629
Ain't that what our mamas
always warned us about?

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:17.464
Are they gonna put Aaron on the stand?

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:19.674
Hell no. Have you seen those interview tapes?

01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:22.844
I mean, that kid's talking
about drinking from a bucket of blood.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:25.555
His story's turned out
to be nothing but pure fantasy.

01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:27.307
Ain't nothing but lies.

01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:30.477
No way they'll let the jury
see how absurd his confabulations are.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:32.729
So the jury's never gonna hear

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:35.440
from this kid who's been the catalyst
for the entire case.

01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:36.942
Oh, but they did hear from him.

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:40.195
Remember Gitchell's ridiculous
manipulations with the tape recorder?

01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:42.989
"Nobody knows what happened but me."

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:50.038
They have to use stunts like that,
what else they got?

01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:53.583
The State sent 600 items
to the lab and out of all that they got nothing

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:57.170
that directly links Damien,
Jason and Jessie to that crime scene.

01:10:58.004 --> 01:10:59.339
Look at this.

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:01.258
Remember how Gitchell told the press

01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:04.010
that the case number
ending in 666 was a coincidence?

01:11:04.678 --> 01:11:06.888
This police report was
signed by Detective Ridge

01:11:06.972 --> 01:11:10.976
three days after our case was assigned,
and the case number ends in 555.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:15.355
They actually changed our case number
to the number of the beast?

01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:18.358
This is a goddamn witch hunt.

01:11:18.525 --> 01:11:21.319
Our boys were never suspects in this case.
They were targets.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:23.780
And once they set their sights
on Jason and Damien,

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:25.031
they stopped looking for anybody else.

01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:27.909
But we don't have to. We can keep looking.

01:11:27.993 --> 01:11:29.911
Ron, we tried to go through everything,

01:11:29.995 --> 01:11:31.705
but they keep sending us mountains of stuff.

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:33.290
Whatever it takes.

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:38.003
We may not be able
to prove our boys didn't do it.

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:41.548
We might be able to prove the cops never
really tried to find out who did.

01:11:51.016 --> 01:11:53.393
<i>AARON'. I was there. Don't you see?</i>

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:57.397
<i>And nobody knows what happened but me.</i>

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.401
<i>DRIVER: About a year ago Damien told me
that the local devil worshippers</i>

01:12:01.443 --> 01:12:06.156
<i>had reached the end of their animal sacrifice
stage. So that summer he said</i>

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:08.533
<i>they were gonna take the next logical step.</i>

01:12:08.575 --> 01:12:11.411
<i>Sacrifice a human. A human.</i>

<i>POLYGRAPH TECHNICIAN: At any time
Wednesday were you in Robin Hood Woods?</i>

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:14.998
DAMIEN: No.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.250
<i>Were you present when
those boys were killed?</i>

01:12:17.292 --> 01:12:18.293
<i>No.</i>

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:20.628
<i>Do you suspect anyone of
having killed those three boys?</i>

01:12:20.712 --> 01:12:21.713
<i>No.</i>

01:12:21.755 --> 01:12:23.256
<i>Do you know who killed those three boys?</i>

01:12:23.298 --> 01:12:24.299
No.

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.760
- Did you kill any of those three boys?
- No.

01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:30.096
<i>GLORY. I know, but this crime is unthinkable.</i>

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:33.475
<i>What if they did it? Have you thought of that?</i>

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:51.951
Do you want some dessert?
I have that chocolate pie you like.

01:12:52.285 --> 01:12:54.329
No thanks, Annie. I'm fine.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.540
You seemed upset when you
were in here the other day,

01:12:57.624 --> 01:13:01.127
having lunch with that lady.
She's really pretty.

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:05.840
- She's my ex-wife.
- Oh.

01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:08.968
Not ex for too long, huh?

01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:15.183
So you okay lately?
I've been worried about you.

01:13:15.683 --> 01:13:17.477
Thanks, Annie, I'm fine.

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:21.564
You know what I'm doing on this case?

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:25.402
Sure, I do.

01:13:28.655 --> 01:13:31.324
You understand why I have to help them.

01:13:33.827 --> 01:13:37.330
If you don't help those poor boys, who will?

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:43.503
Nobody will. Nobody but you.

01:14:26.504 --> 01:14:28.381
Arise and be baptized.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:39.058
Washing away your sins.
Calling on the name of the Lord.

01:14:41.895 --> 01:14:45.398
God will never put more
on you than you can bear.

01:15:09.714 --> 01:15:13.760
GRIFFIS: <i>Occult books talk
about the life force of the blood.</i>

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:18.264
Usually the younger the victim,
the more power or force it has.

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:23.686
And do the type of injuries give an
occult overtone to the murders?

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:28.441
Yes. In some occult rituals,
people are over-killed.

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:32.445
The body is repeatedly killed over and over,

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:35.156
with many cuts and blows.

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:40.537
So would you say that this
crime has the trappings of occultism?

01:15:41.246 --> 01:15:43.706
Of Satanic worship, in particular.

01:15:43.915 --> 01:15:47.669
Dr. Griffis, to get your PhD,
what classes were you required to take?

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:56.719
Uh,none.

01:15:57.303 --> 01:16:01.641
And how were you accepted into enrollment
at Columbia Pacific University?

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:07.063
I had to fill out, uh, several series of papers.

01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:12.986
Did you have to fill out a little flyer like this?

01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:17.699
"Call toll free
for information on how to become a doctor."

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:19.993
This is a mail order college, isn't it?

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:23.162
- University.
- They run a TV ad. Have you seen it?

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:26.541
Yeah, you can send in a request
for what you want your degree in.

01:16:26.666 --> 01:16:29.294
Did you know this was a
correspondence school? I didn't.

01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:33.423
Judge, the witness has a mail order PhD
from a non-accredited school

01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:36.843
that required no classes.
We object to Dr. Griffis as an expert.

01:16:37.135 --> 01:16:40.263
Well, I'm not sure within Arkansas
you need a degree of any kind

01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:42.807
to be considered an expert
in a particular field.

01:16:43.391 --> 01:16:47.854
And I'm not persuaded at all
by your argument about a mail order PhD.

01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:54.193
So I'm ruling him as qualified
as an expert in the area of occult.

01:17:06.706 --> 01:17:09.459
I'm looking for the manager, Marty King.
Is he here?

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.502
He's in the back. I'll fetch him.

01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:19.719
Looks like business is pretty good.

01:17:19.886 --> 01:17:22.388
A whole lot better than it was
now that they've caught them Satanists

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:23.890
who murdered them little boys.

01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:27.060
I'm the manager. What can I do for you?

01:17:27.101 --> 01:17:29.062
My name is Ron Lax. I'm an investigator,

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.314
and I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:32.690
about the night of May the 5th?

01:17:32.732 --> 01:17:36.069
Well, certainly,
I'll be glad to help out however I can.

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:40.531
Hey, boss.
Here's one I don't remember seeing before.

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.825
Who's Christopher Morgan?

01:17:43.076 --> 01:17:46.537
Did you in any way participate in
causing the death of any of those three boys?

01:17:46.579 --> 01:17:47.914
No.

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:51.084
Do you know for sure
who caused those boys to die?

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:52.543
No.

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:55.505
Are you holding back any information
about those three boys?

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:56.714
No.

01:17:56.798 --> 01:17:58.800
The polygraph showed deception.

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:01.928
He says you went off the chart.

01:18:02.762 --> 01:18:05.348
I don't know why I failed it.
Must have been nervous.

01:18:28.121 --> 01:18:30.123
This is so fucking screwed up!

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:32.583
Chris, I have a legal obligation
to get to the truth...

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:35.962
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Or to exonerate you if you weren't involved.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:37.588
But based on the polygraph results,

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.132
I don't feel like you're being
completely honest.

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:40.800
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to lie to you?

01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:44.137
Okay, I'm gonna lie.
I killed them. And all the other bullshit.

01:18:44.512 --> 01:18:47.098
- Are you arresting me?
- No, I am not.

-No!</i>

<i>I have never hurt anyone intentionally.</i>

Maybe there's two sides to you.

01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:25.678
Maybe I'm Chris and Hyde.

01:19:28.514 --> 01:19:32.018
I'm Ron Lax. Come this way.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.237
Chris!

01:19:45.031 --> 01:19:47.533
Your Honor, the defense calls
Christopher Morgan.

01:19:57.877 --> 01:19:59.754
Your Honor, may we approach?

(CLEARS THROAT)

01:20:07.762 --> 01:20:10.223
Your Honor, I think they
are going to try to cross-examine him

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:13.643
from the Oceanside police report,
and we submit that it's irrelevant.

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:17.563
My understanding was that
this young man retracted his statement.

01:20:17.605 --> 01:20:20.858
We want to question Mr. Morgan to suggest
that the police case was far from certain.

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.735
Why would his testimony be relevant?

01:20:22.777 --> 01:20:26.405
FORD: Your Honor, we all want to question
witnesses that the police viewed as suspects

01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:28.324
before narrowing their focus on the accused.

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:31.869
I'm not gonna allow you to
drag in every possible suspect

01:20:31.911 --> 01:20:36.082
unless you've got something that tie those
persons to some event in this case.

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:40.169
Judge Burnett, don't you think
a confession suffices as a tie-in?

01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:42.922
Your Honor, they could just talk to anybody
on the street and they could say,

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:44.674
-"Do you admit doing these murders?"
- Come on!

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:47.677
This is not just anybody off the street.
This was the Oceanside PD

You, too, Mr. Lax.
I don't believe you're an officer of the court.

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:25.172
Mr. Morgan, please step
forward to be sworn in.

questioning Chris Morgan?

01:21:27.592 --> 01:21:29.927
And why aren't we allowed
to hear what he says?

son and brought Chris Morgan into my home.

Yeah, after 17 hours I believe anybody would.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:21.520
Now, before you made
the statements in question,

01:22:21.562 --> 01:22:24.649
did you tell the officers in a state of anger that

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:28.819
"if you want me to lie to you,
I'll lie to you and tell you that I did it"?

01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:30.529
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

01:22:30.613 --> 01:22:34.116
And immediately after that,
did you again deny any knowledge

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.162
-of involvement in these murders?
- Yes.

01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:41.999
All right. Anything else?

admitted he did it, then denied it again

We are entitled to raise reasonable doubt.

to get that kid on the stand

-to show how arbitrary it's been.

01:23:11.779 --> 01:23:13.322
But the judge says that's not relevant

because Morgan told the cops
he was gonna lie.

Besides, Fogleman says there's
no tape for the part

01:23:18.244 --> 01:23:21.747
-of the interview where Morgan confesses.
- What? No, that's bullshit.

01:23:22.373 --> 01:23:25.418
You can't see part of the tape
because Morgan put a tissue across the lens.

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:27.878
I saw it. I watched the whole thing.

01:23:28.129 --> 01:23:29.672
But you can see it when he confesses.

I should have told him what?

Now, you want to try these cases, Ron?
Maybe you should have gone to law school.

Jason, the prosecutor's
office wants to offer you a deal.

01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:09.725
If you agree to testify against Damien,

01:27:09.808 --> 01:27:13.771
they'll only seek a sentence of 20 years.
Not death.

01:27:15.022 --> 01:27:17.650
Now, you could be out
in 10 years, maybe less.

01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:20.653
That's still a long time, though.

01:27:21.737 --> 01:27:24.949
In 10 years you'll be what? 26 years old?

You'll have your whole life ahead of you.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.665
The case against you is weak.

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:36.168

to tie you to Damien and his beliefs,

01:27:38.212 --> 01:27:40.756
And despite the lack
of evidence, it is very possible

01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:45.261
that Damien will go down for this.
And if he does,

01:27:45.344 --> 01:27:48.847
there's a good chance he's
gonna drag you down with him.

something about the murders?

01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:14.039

he was gonna kill two more.

has identified Damien Echols.

01:29:44.004 --> 01:29:47.424

01:30:26.547 --> 01:30:28.340
you went to the Bojangles Restaurant.

01:30:28.424 --> 01:30:32.052
Did you take blood scrapings
from inside the women's restroom?

01:30:32.136 --> 01:30:36.515
Yes, sir. I found trace remains in the
ladies' bathroom of the Bojangles.

01:30:37.975 --> 01:30:43.272
PRICE: Detective, what is the date you sent
the scrapings to the crime lab to be analyzed?

01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:46.775
They were never sent.

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:51.155
All right. Where are the
samples at this time, Detective?

01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:56.201
I don't know, sir. They were lost.

01:30:56.535 --> 01:30:59.204
PAM: What?
PRICE: You mean blood evidence

01:30:59.705 --> 01:31:05.085
that you took for the purpose
of sending to the crime lab is just lost?

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:08.172
Yes, sir.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:12.885
That's my mistake. I lost a piece of evidence.

01:31:26.023 --> 01:31:31.069
Now, Damien, this book on witchcraft,
where did you get that?

01:31:31.111 --> 01:31:34.698
The library had these books they were
getting rid of for 10 cents each.

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:38.202
Damien, there's some pages
in there that are underlined in red,

01:31:38.243 --> 01:31:39.786
references to the devil.

01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:41.914
That was already done when I got it.

01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:45.000

to do 'cause all through the book

01:31:45.083 --> 01:31:48.921
there's like little notes,
dates, and stuff like that in the margin.

Okay.

Damien, why do you like to wear black?

01:31:59.598 --> 01:32:02.100
I was told I look good in it.

01:32:02.768 --> 01:32:05.437
And it helped me deal with people.

01:32:07.272 --> 01:32:11.693
It would make them think
"He's weird." And it kept them away.

- I'm familiar with it.
- You familiar with Aleister Crowley?

01:32:25.499 --> 01:32:30.462
Based on his writings,
he believes in human sacrifice, doesn't he?

01:32:30.504 --> 01:32:33.298
He also believed he was God, so...

01:32:33.382 --> 01:32:38.887
His writings indicated that children
were the best type of human sacrifice.

01:32:39.972 --> 01:32:42.641
- Correct?
- Yes, sir.

01:32:42.808 --> 01:32:46.395
But Crowley has no particular
significance to you?

01:32:47.104 --> 01:32:51.775

but I've never read anything by him.

If you say so.

Now, when he interviewed you
before your arrest, did you tell Officer Ridge

01:33:44.745 --> 01:33:47.581
that you'd been a member
of a white witch group for five years?

01:33:47.664 --> 01:33:50.167
I told him I was a Wiccan.
I've never been a member of a group.

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:52.377
- Oh, he made that up?
- Yes.

01:33:52.461 --> 01:33:56.506
Officer Ridge also asked you
why would someone kill these kids

01:33:56.548 --> 01:34:01.261
and your response was that the person
was sick or a Satanist. Is that correct?

01:34:01.762 --> 01:34:07.100
He asked me was it possible if they could be
Satanists, and I said "Yeah, I guess."

01:34:07.184 --> 01:34:12.564
When Officer Ridge asked you how do you
think the person feels who did this,

01:34:13.398 --> 01:34:18.236
your answer was,
"Probably makes them feel good.

01:34:18.904 --> 01:34:21.031
"Gives them power."

01:34:22.115 --> 01:34:25.619
Is that correct?
Or, I guess, Officer Ridge made that up, too.

No. I used common sense on that.

they must have wanted to.

And if they were doing something they
wanted to it must make them happy.

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:39.758
So in your mind it is common sense

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:43.470
that killing three eight-year-olds
would make you feel good?

01:42:11.376 --> 01:42:13.920
I don't know why they didn't find it on him.

01:42:15.171 --> 01:42:18.049
And I don't know why my
husband would have it now.

01:42:18.633 --> 01:42:21.678
You suspect your husband
might have something do to with all of this?

01:42:21.761 --> 01:42:25.807
I don't know. I don't know.

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:31.563
I don't know anything anymore.

01:42:32.438 --> 01:42:36.734
After hearing Jessie's confession,

01:42:36.776 --> 01:42:41.406
and all those things he didn't know

01:42:41.447 --> 01:42:45.493
and the bloody man at Bojangles,

01:42:45.577 --> 01:42:48.413
and Mark Byers and that bloody knife.

01:42:49.247 --> 01:42:51.082
And those girls up on the stand,

01:42:51.166 --> 01:42:54.294
acting like this is all just
some sort of game to them.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:00.466
And what about Chris Morgan? They told me
that he confessed out in California,

01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:04.053
and they wouldn't even let us hear
what he had to say on the stand.

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:10.685
It seems like everybody,
the police, the judge, everybody,

01:43:10.768 --> 01:43:14.272
they all know who they want to think did this.

01:43:16.774 --> 01:43:18.568
I don't know anymore.

01:43:21.321 --> 01:43:22.739
Neither do I.

01:43:27.452 --> 01:43:32.707
But I know in my heart that
Damien, Jason and Jessie did not do this.

01:44:03.154 --> 01:44:08.618
<i>STEVIE: Well that's all right, Mama
That's all right for you</i>

01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:13.498
<i>That's all right, Mama
Just any way you do</i>

01:44:13.665 --> 01:44:14.666
<i>That's all right</i>

01:44:35.019 --> 01:44:39.732
Is that too tight? You'll be back soon.

01:44:39.857 --> 01:44:43.361
Real soon, sweetheart. I promise.
