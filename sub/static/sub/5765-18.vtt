WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:02.469
Previously on The Good Wife:
Sorry about that, Mr....?

00:02.500 --> 00:05.663
McVeigh.
Oh, my goodness, what
an unfortunate name.

00:05.700 --> 00:07.668
Hopefully no relation?

00:07.700 --> 00:09.668
Oh, um, I've
offended you?

00:09.710 --> 00:11.666
No. No.

00:11.710 --> 00:13.769
I'll talk to you soon.

00:13.810 --> 00:15.334
(laughs)

00:15.380 --> 00:17.598
I think I've just been visited
by the Marlborough Man.

00:17.650 --> 00:20.574
WILL:
I played craps
with that kid's life.

00:20.620 --> 00:24.044
Will, you listen.
I know you did everything.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.224
We're not gonna talk about this.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.796
We're not gonna
say any more.

00:35.830 --> 00:38.128
We're gonna go to dinner
in one week's time,

00:38.170 --> 00:39.330
and we'll talk then.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.506
Hey.

00:55.850 --> 00:57.078
Let's go to the bedroom.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.144
No. Here.

01:02.860 --> 01:05.078
(coughing)

01:07.300 --> 01:08.790
So we can talk
now, right?

01:08.830 --> 01:10.195
I mean, the
trial's over.

01:10.230 --> 01:12.130
We can talk now.
JUROR 1:
Yeah, we can talk.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.468
We can swear.
We can do whatever we want.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.298
Okay, so, we'll do
bathroom breaks first,

01:17.340 --> 01:19.171
then, uh, get
down to it.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.734
So, uh, what do you think?

01:20.780 --> 01:22.645
Guilty, right?
She did it.

01:22.680 --> 01:23.874
Actually,

01:23.910 --> 01:25.548
I think we should wait.
For everybody.

01:25.580 --> 01:28.310
Did you see her at
the defense table?

01:28.350 --> 01:29.749
JUROR 2:
Which her?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.314
The one
with the televangelist?

01:31.350 --> 01:32.157
No, no, no. Um,

01:32.190 --> 01:33.782
the one who sucked
the toes.
Huh?

01:33.820 --> 01:35.219
Oh, come on.
What was his name?

01:35.260 --> 01:36.522
The prostitute.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.255
JUROR 1:
You're talking about
the defense attorney?

01:38.290 --> 01:39.359
She's the wife, right?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.220
Right. I thought
I recognized her.

01:41.260 --> 01:42.625
At the defense table.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.161
WILL:
Reasonable doubt.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.761
What do we mean
by reasonable doubt?

01:48.800 --> 01:50.609
JUROR 3:
I thought the husband got out.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.608
Didn't he get out?
JUROR 1:
Boy, talk about using her.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.437
Putting her at the defense table
like that.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.708
She's there
'cause she's a good lawyer.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.207
(overlapping chatter)

01:57.250 --> 01:58.274
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:58.310 --> 01:59.572
Everybody ready?

01:59.620 --> 02:00.848
Do we want

02:00.880 --> 02:02.279
to vote first?

02:02.320 --> 02:03.639
JUROR 4:
Right. Good idea.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.318
Um, everyone take a pad.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.487
WILL:
So when you take that vote,

02:08.520 --> 02:10.829
you have to ask yourself,

02:10.860 --> 02:13.328
is this young woman

02:13.360 --> 02:15.351
capable of murder?

02:18.330 --> 02:20.696
Cou_ld Bianca Price
pick up a gun

02:20.740 --> 02:24.506
and shoot her sorority
mate in the chest?

02:24.540 --> 02:25.939
Okay.

02:25.970 --> 02:28.200
Six guilty, six not guilty.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.946
Of course.
Which is so odd,

02:29.980 --> 02:31.675
given we have six men
and six women.

02:31.710 --> 02:32.847
Oh, what are
you saying,

02:32.880 --> 02:34.108
this is a sexist thing?

02:34.150 --> 02:36.641
Well, of course not. This has
nothing to do with her looks.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.214
True.
That's right.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.854
She's just a sweet girl
having a threesome.

02:39.890 --> 02:42.381
That's because
men can't Imagine

02:42.430 --> 02:43.351
a pretty woman
killing somebody.

02:43.390 --> 02:44.823
JUROR 1:
Oh, come on.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.748
It's because the prosecution
didn't do their job.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.892
Exactly.
Oh, fine.

02:47.930 --> 02:50.694
Sure, I voted not guilty,
but not because of her looks.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.334
Why isn't it
just as likely

02:52.370 --> 02:53.735
that women are jealous
of her looks?

02:53.770 --> 02:54.896
Thank you,
brother.

02:54.940 --> 02:56.339
You are _so
over the line.

02:56.370 --> 02:57.359
Thank you.
He's right.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.866
So over
the line.
He's right.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.901
Women look at that girl
and think home wrecker.

03:00.940 --> 03:02.771
Except she's not a girl.
She's a grown woman.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.277
Okay, but Saint--
what-what's her name?

03:04.310 --> 03:06.312
Alicia.
Right, Alicia Florrick.

03:06.350 --> 03:08.318
She was sitting right next
to her, supporting her.

03:08.350 --> 03:09.078
JUROR 5:
And defense attorneys

03:09.120 --> 03:11.281
could never be
pulling tricks.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.457
(laughter and chatter)

03:12.490 --> 03:13.718
Let's just stick
to the facts, huh?

03:13.760 --> 03:15.250
JUROR 4:
All right,
all right, everybody,

03:15.290 --> 03:16.427
raised hands, please.

03:16.460 --> 03:17.449
One at a time.

03:17.490 --> 03:18.684
Marisol.

03:18.730 --> 03:20.550
Okay, take the cop,
the detective.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.295
Back on the first day
of testimony,

03:22.330 --> 03:23.592
he looked right at us
and said...

03:23.630 --> 03:24.665
The accused was
covered with blood.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.294
And she was the only one
in the room with the victim.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.693
And the murder weapon?

03:28.740 --> 03:30.935
9mm auto 6-round.

03:30.970 --> 03:32.278
It was the defendant's,

03:32.310 --> 03:33.777
registered
in her name.

03:38.350 --> 03:40.318
Given to her _
by her mother for protection.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.739
The weapon was found on
the ground by her feet?

03:42.790 --> 03:43.939
Yes, sir.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.981
With her fingerprints
on the trigger.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.424
JUROR 5:
I have a question.

03:49.460 --> 03:52.293
Who was the girl who entered
in the middle of his testimony?

03:52.330 --> 03:54.594
Oh, that's right.
He smiled at her.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.461
I thought she was
with the defense.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.297
TONY:
There was a party downstairs

03:58.330 --> 03:59.991
for spring break.
30 individuals.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.361
And they heard
the shot?
Yes, snr.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.401
Within 30 seconds, they burst
into the sorority room

04:04.440 --> 04:05.930
and found the accused,
Bianca Price,

04:05.970 --> 04:07.005
standing over
the victim.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.873
How long after the murder
was this photo taken?

04:09.910 --> 04:12.378
Approximately
30 seconds.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.546
That's the good news about

04:13.580 --> 04:15.013
murders at colleges
these days.

04:15.050 --> 04:17.439
Everybody has a cell phone
camera, so it makes it hard

04:17.490 --> 04:19.412
to get away
with murder.
Objection!

04:19.460 --> 04:21.382
That wasn't a question,
Mr. Gardner.

04:22.790 --> 04:25.429
But I would warn_ the witness
to avord

04:25.460 --> 04:26.597
editorializing.

04:26.630 --> 04:27.756
My apologies, Your Honor.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.926
Now, this happened

04:28.960 --> 04:30.723
at her sorority house?
Yes, sir.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.658
There was blood all
over her.
And this was taken

04:32.700 --> 04:34.429
within 30 seconds
of the gunshot,

04:34.470 --> 04:36.859
and here she is
with the gun at her feet.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.434
She said she was in
the bathroom, and she came out.

04:38.470 --> 04:39.607
JUROR 6:
No, she didn't say that.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.777
Her lavwer said that.

04:40.810 --> 04:42.038
WILL:
Now Bianca has said

04:42.080 --> 04:44.071
she was in the bathroom
when she heard the shot.

04:44.110 --> 04:46.044
Objection, Your Honor.
Not in evidence.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.968
Mr. Gardner,
I expect more of you.

04:48.020 --> 04:50.443
Your Honor, I'm sorry.
My mistake.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.412
JUROR 4:
Okay, I'll say it.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.711
I didn't trust that cop.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.354
And his earring. What was that?

04:56.390 --> 04:57.880
Men wear earrings
these days.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.454
And what about
the five o'clock shadow?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.024
So what are you saying?

05:01.060 --> 05:02.698
You don't trust him
because he didn't shave?

05:02.730 --> 05:03.992
WILL: _
So, Detective
Burton, you were

05:04.030 --> 05:05.520
the first officer
on the scene?

05:05.570 --> 05:07.367
Yes, Mr. Gardner.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.537
WILL:
And where was your partner?

05:08.570 --> 05:09.707
TONY:
He was out sick.

05:09.740 --> 05:11.503
So you were
there unobserved?

05:11.540 --> 05:13.474
Yes, I was unobserved,

05:13.510 --> 05:16.502
except for the two dozen other
college students in the room.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.541
And you've never tampered
with evidence, Detective?

05:18.580 --> 05:19.808
That's correct, sir.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.374
I've never tampered
with evidence.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.944
WILL:
And so if I asked you

05:22.990 --> 05:25.550
about this Internal Affairs
report...

05:25.590 --> 05:26.818
Objection, Your Honor!

05:28.060 --> 05:29.209
Up here.

05:29.260 --> 05:32.559
JUROR 3:
Then what about
the Internal Affairs report?

05:32.600 --> 05:33.726
What Internal
Affairs report?!

05:33.760 --> 05:35.398
We didn't hear
anything about that.

05:35.430 --> 05:36.658
It could have been
completely Innocent.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.792
Are you serious?

05:37.830 --> 05:40.492
(loud, overlapping chatter)

05:40.540 --> 05:42.462
This charge is
irrelevant, and
it was minor.

05:42.510 --> 05:43.704
Drinking beer
on duty?

05:43.740 --> 05:45.537
You are playing
with ﬁre here, Mr. Gardner.

05:45.570 --> 05:46.639
Your Honor,

05:46.680 --> 05:48.898
any Internal Affairs charge
is completely relevant.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.669
No, sir. You're trying
to imply to the jury

05:50.710 --> 05:53.577
that something more nefarious
is going on here--

05:53.620 --> 05:55.474
that Detectiv_e Burton
planted eVIdence.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.488
Let's at least
be adults here

05:57.520 --> 05:59.511
and admit to each other
what you're doing.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.118
Your Honor, no.
Oh-oh, my God,

06:01.160 --> 06:02.582
no. No. I...

06:02.630 --> 06:03.949
Look, I will admonish the jury.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.878
That's all I can do, Mr. Brody.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.921
And you watch it, Mr. Gardner.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.397
Go to hell.

06:11.430 --> 06:12.761
Having fun?

06:12.800 --> 06:14.939
(overlapping chatter)

06:14.970 --> 06:15.891
Wait. Wait. Wait.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.965
The judge admonished us
not to consider it.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.534
All right, I won't
consider it,

06:19.580 --> 06:20.979
but I still don't trust Speedy.

06:21.010 --> 06:22.841
CUESTA:
We'll reconvene
here 9:30

06:22.880 --> 06:24.507
tomorrow.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.909
So, You enjoy
tarnishing my reputation?

06:35.960 --> 06:37.951
Best part of my day.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.626
Hey, Jimmy, man.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.525
What's up?

06:46.640 --> 06:49.097
I don't think they liked me.

06:49.140 --> 06:50.869
Who, the jury? No.
You can never tell.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.468
Ijust...

06:52.510 --> 06:54.808
sound so terrible.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.603
I think
I'd find me guilty.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.471
(laughs):
No, that's just the
prosecution's case.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.511
You wait for our turn.

07:01.550 --> 07:03.017
Thank you.

07:03.050 --> 07:04.642
You're welcome.
Any time.

07:04.690 --> 07:05.782
Thank you.

07:05.820 --> 07:07.788
I'll see you, Mom.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.128
How did it go,
did you think?

07:14.160 --> 07:15.718
It's a good start.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.864
I'm sorry, but
we're playing catch-up here.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.936
Your previous lavwers
did no investigation,

07:19.970 --> 07:21.528
and Cuesta isn't
allowmg a delay,

07:21.570 --> 07:22.969
so we're gonna hit
a few bumps.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.659
We're gonna need
to spend some more money

07:24.710 --> 07:25.699
on a better
ballistics expert.

07:25.740 --> 07:27.173
Are you all right
with that?

07:27.210 --> 07:29.235
Whatever it takes.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.613
She's my only child.

07:32.650 --> 07:34.641
The thought of her
in prison is...

07:40.960 --> 07:42.518
Good work.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.448
Thanks.

07:46.290 --> 07:47.848
Is everything okay?

07:47.900 --> 07:49.151
Yeah. Why?
Yeah. Good.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.775
I heard you did well.

08:01.810 --> 08:04.574
There's more women
on this jury than I wanted.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.577
Sometimes I think

08:05.610 --> 08:07.714
justice would be better served
with a coin flip.

08:08.750 --> 08:09.887
Who's that?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.615
Oh, uh, Mother Jones.

08:11.650 --> 08:13.709
Doing a profile.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.724
Sorry about that.

08:16.760 --> 08:19.081
We're knee-deep
in the Bianca Price trial.

08:19.130 --> 08:21.257
You were just saying
about pro-choice.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.564
Oh, yes, it's an
irony of our times

08:23.600 --> 08:26.125
that "activist judge"
used to be a charge

08:26.170 --> 08:27.831
hurled by
Republicans at...

08:30.640 --> 08:32.574
Democrats?

08:32.610 --> 08:33.736
Excuse me?

08:33.780 --> 08:35.634
Hurled at Democrats?

08:35.680 --> 08:37.045
Oh, uh, yes.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.568
The charge of activist

08:40.620 --> 08:44.545
judge, especially
with regards to...

08:46.660 --> 08:48.252
Um...

08:48.290 --> 08:50.622
My goodness, I forgot
what I was, uh, saying.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.127
Choice is endangered.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.720
Oh, yes, choice.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.625
It is.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.069
Could you give
me a minute?

09:01.340 --> 09:04.559
Thank you
for the Sarah Palin biography.

09:07.010 --> 09:08.602
Oh, I, uh, I thought
you'd like that.

09:08.640 --> 09:12.144
The chapter where
she brings big oil to heel.

09:12.180 --> 09:13.841
Just gripping.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.644
I bought a, uh...
a Hillary bio

09:16.690 --> 09:18.817
for 50 cents on eBay.

09:18.850 --> 09:22.058
So you're, uh...

09:22.090 --> 09:24.684
Will says he wants you
on the Bianca Price murder?

09:24.730 --> 09:25.856
Yeah. Yeah.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.152
I'm, uh...
I'm in town

09:27.200 --> 09:28.599
testifying on another case.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.166
Good.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.293
Well, I-I just
wanted to say hello.

09:32.330 --> 09:33.661
Hello.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.793
You betcha.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.773
Uh, you know my rules.

09:42.810 --> 09:45.870
If, uh... if I find out the
client's guilty, I quit.

09:45.910 --> 09:47.673
Yup. I like your rules.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.244
Even more, I like your fees.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.713
Well, th...

09:50.750 --> 09:52.217
(door opens)
Yeah?

09:52.250 --> 09:53.979
I thought I'd sit in.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.319
Miss Lockhart.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.726
Mr. McVeigh.

10:01.230 --> 10:02.891
So, the problem is,

10:02.930 --> 10:04.693
the mom fired
her preVIous lawyers

10:04.730 --> 10:06.732
because they wanted
to plead this out.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.260
So they lined up Jim Crosby

10:08.300 --> 10:10.268
as a ballistics expert.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.039
Well, I agreed
to meet with you.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.230
You did. Thanks.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.670
And I agreed to look over the
evidence, give you a bid.

10:16.710 --> 10:17.779
Which is?

10:18.850 --> 10:20.272
I'm not taking this case.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.878
She's guilty.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.880
Sorry.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.649
I can give you
some names

10:26.690 --> 10:28.112
of people who will
say differently,

10:28.160 --> 10:29.684
but I wouldn't
go with Crosby.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.755
_He's not
convmcmg enough.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.052
Um, you're positive?

10:33.100 --> 10:34.749
She's guilty?

10:34.800 --> 10:37.689
Given the evidence, yes.

10:37.730 --> 10:39.960
IfI were you, I'd plead out.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.831
Good luck.

10:41.870 --> 10:44.009
(door opens)

10:44.040 --> 10:47.874
WILL:
The jury needs
to be told a story.

10:47.910 --> 10:49.946
The prosecution's story
is simple:

10:49.980 --> 10:52.301
Bianca shot her best friend

10:52.350 --> 10:54.318
out of jealousy
after a threesome.

10:54.350 --> 10:56.443
Our story needs to be
just as simple:

10:56.480 --> 10:59.187
Bianca didn't shoot Heather.

10:59.220 --> 11:00.915
Yes, it was Bianca's gun,

11:00.960 --> 11:03.428
but her mother had given it her
for protection.

11:03.460 --> 11:04.984
What we need to tell the jury

11:05.030 --> 11:07.294
is who else had access
to Bianca's gun?

11:07.330 --> 11:08.888
Joshua Mundy...

11:08.930 --> 11:10.090
See any difference?

11:10.130 --> 11:11.825
He was with the girls
for the threesome,

11:11.870 --> 11:13.235
who shot Heather while
Bianca was in the bathroom.

11:13.270 --> 11:15.135
No. Why?

11:15.170 --> 11:17.764
Regarding the
witness prep,
Cary, Alicia,

11:17.810 --> 11:19.869
we're gonna have to delay
on the ballistics expert.

11:19.910 --> 11:21.229
Why?
We lost him.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.235
We're shopping.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.144
Okay, that's everything.

11:23.180 --> 11:25.899
We got court in one hour,
so let's go.

11:27.750 --> 11:28.739
Will?

11:28.780 --> 11:29.883
What's up?

11:29.920 --> 11:32.218
This cell phone photo
on Jenny Bauer's student page,

11:32.250 --> 11:34.480
it's different than the one
she gave to the police.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.227
There. On this one,
that guy's foot is on the rug,

11:37.260 --> 11:38.750
and on this one it's not.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.257
She took
another picture?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.222
Only a split second
between both shots.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.399
It's on video.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.295
Cell phone video.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.796
Find it.

11:51.970 --> 11:52.902
CARY:
I'll get that for you.

11:52.940 --> 11:54.077
KALINDA:
Thanks.

11:54.110 --> 11:57.079
_ Idon't know _
If we're gonna put Blanca

11:57.110 --> 11:59.044
on the stand yet,
but if we do,

11:59.080 --> 12:00.911
are you all right
questioning her?

12:00.950 --> 12:03.282
I'm... Yes.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.912
But I think

12:04.950 --> 12:06.383
Cary would do
a better job.

12:06.420 --> 12:07.387
Why?

12:07.420 --> 12:09.888
They seem to have bonded.

12:09.930 --> 12:13.798
15 years of doing this
and I still can never tell

12:13.830 --> 12:15.252
who's innocent and who's guilty.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.861
Everybody's a mystery
from the outside,

12:18.900 --> 12:20.060
including Bianca.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.031
We still haven't had our dinner.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.332
I know.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.348
You worried about Peter?

12:31.380 --> 12:34.076
(sighs)

12:34.120 --> 12:36.782
I'm worried about everything.

12:36.820 --> 12:38.845
I'm not.

12:43.990 --> 12:47.994
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

12:55.570 --> 12:57.538
(overlapping chatter)

12:57.570 --> 12:59.561
All right, all right,

12:59.610 --> 13:03.478
all right! Everybody, let's talk
one at a time, please.

13:03.510 --> 13:04.579
Marisol.

13:04.610 --> 13:06.441
Of course he was scuzzy.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.516
I don't want to marry him.
Ijust believe him.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.438
It was Heather's idea.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.445
Heather Cross,

13:11.490 --> 13:13.355
the victim?
Yeah.

13:13.390 --> 13:14.948
She's never done
a three-way before

13:14.990 --> 13:17.151
on zolpidem, and she wanted to.

13:17.190 --> 13:19.897
This was the night
before spring break.
Yeah-huh.

13:19.930 --> 13:24.264
She came to me downstairs,
and she was, like, um...

13:24.300 --> 13:26.837
Do you want me to quote?

13:26.870 --> 13:29.168
'Cause if I quote,
I have to use that word.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.964
Oh, no, you don't, Mr. Mundy,
not in my court.

13:32.010 --> 13:33.329
When you feel
so inclined,

13:33.380 --> 13:34.972
you are welcome to use
the word "fluff."

13:35.010 --> 13:36.602
And Judy--

13:36.640 --> 13:38.141
delicate flower
that she is--

13:38.180 --> 13:40.546
_ will translate it into
Its proper form. Yes, Judy?

13:41.580 --> 13:44.287
JOSH:
Okay. So, um...

13:44.320 --> 13:46.345
there was, like...

13:46.390 --> 13:49.257
"Do you want to go... fluff
upstairs

13:49.290 --> 13:51.520
with Bianca on zolpidem?"

13:51.560 --> 13:52.720
And I was, like...

13:52.760 --> 13:55.627
It was something she read
in the whole Tiger Woods thing--

13:55.660 --> 13:58.891
zolpidem sex, you know?
Relaxed and crazy.

13:58.930 --> 14:02.593
And I was, like,
(chuckles) you know?

14:02.640 --> 14:04.858
No, I don't know, Mr. Mundy.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.299
You'll have to use your words.

14:07.340 --> 14:10.571
Iw
as, like "S
, ure."

14:10.610 --> 14:14.569
I mean, um... "Fluff, yeah."

14:14.620 --> 14:17.384
Oh, the joy my life is.

14:17.420 --> 14:18.580
Have you got that, Judy?

14:18.620 --> 14:21.657
And you and Bianca
had been dating?

14:21.690 --> 14:23.487
Yeah.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.486
And she was always kinda
freaking out about women,

14:25.530 --> 14:27.555
so I was surprised
that she agreed to go with us.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.467
"Freaking out,"
meaning jealous?

14:30.500 --> 14:31.899
Yes.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.090
Then what happened?

14:35.140 --> 14:37.608
Well, we... fluffed.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.664
(chuckles)

14:38.710 --> 14:41.304
And I mean fluffed.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.898
And, uh, I left
the two of them

14:42.950 --> 14:44.508
_ kin_da out of it
In BIanca's room,

14:44.550 --> 14:46.609
and I went downstairs
to grab a brew.

14:46.650 --> 14:48.618
And that's when we heard
the shot.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.917
and I found Heather
on the floor, you know, like,

14:54.960 --> 15:00.057
really red with blood
and the gun on the floor.

15:17.010 --> 15:18.602
Oh, that's right.

15:18.650 --> 15:19.969
You're here
on another case.

15:20.020 --> 15:20.611
That's right.
We're ready.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.140
You want to watch?

15:22.180 --> 15:23.681
Oh, well, I-I would,

15:23.720 --> 15:25.187
but I'm late.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.558
Dinner?

15:32.590 --> 15:35.559
Tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m.,
the Westin.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.555
I, uh,

15:36.600 --> 15:38.659
uh, o-okay.

15:40.770 --> 15:42.192
Hmm.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.105
(chuckles)

15:44.140 --> 15:46.665
So, you'd been dating Bianca
for a while?

15:46.710 --> 15:49.008
Uh, a little while, yeah.

15:49.040 --> 15:49.631
A little while,

15:49.680 --> 15:53.013
as in two dates?

15:53.050 --> 15:55.018
Yeah, I guess.

15:55.050 --> 15:58.713
And by "dates,"
we mean you slept

15:58.750 --> 16:00.650
with her twice?

16:00.690 --> 16:01.657
Yeah.

16:01.690 --> 16:03.487
You have that effect on women?

16:03.530 --> 16:06.124
They get jealous
after two dates?

16:06.160 --> 16:08.390
Objection. Argumentative.

16:08.430 --> 16:10.421
Sustained, regrettably.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.324
Now about this
zolpidem

16:12.370 --> 16:14.565
that Heather and Bianca took,
you took it, too?

16:14.600 --> 16:15.669
Yeah.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.258
And you know
zolpidem is

16:17.310 --> 16:19.107
a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic?

16:19.140 --> 16:20.471
(chuckles)
What?

16:20.510 --> 16:22.273
You can hallucinate
on It.

16:22.310 --> 16:25.370
You might also get diarrhea.

16:25.410 --> 16:29.642
(chuckles)
Well, I...I didn't get diarrhea.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.545
Good. I'm so glad.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.512
But did you hallucinate?

16:33.560 --> 16:34.481
No.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.556
It's also a drug
that can cause memory loss.

16:36.590 --> 16:37.727
Did you know that?

16:37.760 --> 16:40.058
No.
In fact,

16:40.100 --> 16:41.453
let's do an experiment.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.353
Objection.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.425
You know I like experiments,
Mr. Brody.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.664
Overruled.

16:45.700 --> 16:49.761
ALICIA:
What color panties
was Bianca wearing that night?

16:49.800 --> 16:53.372
JOSH:
What color? Uh...

16:53.410 --> 16:54.308
white.

16:54.340 --> 16:57.070
Well, that is
a very good guess, Mr. Mundy,

16:57.110 --> 17:00.671
given that 85% of the panties
sold in the US. are white.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.278
And yet you're wrong.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.185
They were black.

17:05.850 --> 17:08.387
JUROR 3: _
See? That was SIIIy.

17:08.420 --> 17:10.058
Men don't remember
things like that.

17:10.090 --> 17:12.650
The color of a woman's panties?
Are you kidding me?

17:12.690 --> 17:13.691
Not at that moment.

17:13.730 --> 17:14.526
(all laugh)

17:14.560 --> 17:15.822
And you're telling me

17:15.860 --> 17:17.794
she's having sex
with her boyfriend,

17:17.830 --> 17:20.560
another girl,
and she's not jealous?

17:20.600 --> 17:23.239
Well, actually,
that was a stretch for me.

17:23.270 --> 17:25.329
I mean, she only slept
with the guy twice.

17:25.370 --> 17:26.701
That doesn't make him
a boyfriend.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.071
So are you
changing sides?

17:28.110 --> 17:29.475
Now you're not guilty?

17:29.510 --> 17:30.738
No. I don't know.

17:30.780 --> 17:31.747
Ijust...

17:31.780 --> 17:34.374
The motive seemed
rIdIculous.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.672
College today-- a threesome
doesn't mean anything.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.142
I'm getting old.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.748
I'm going back
to college.

17:39.790 --> 17:40.779
(all laugh)

17:40.820 --> 17:42.310
JUROR 1:
All right.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.328
I think we should take
another vote with our hands.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.248
All those in favor
of not guilty?

17:49.600 --> 17:50.828
Seven to five.

17:50.870 --> 17:51.859
Now we're getting somewhere.

17:51.900 --> 17:52.969
I want to know

17:53.000 --> 17:56.436
how those voting not guilty
can explain the picture.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.761
What I don't understand,
Miss Bauer,

17:59.810 --> 18:01.277
is I looked
at your student page,

18:01.310 --> 18:03.346
and there's
a different shot.

18:03.380 --> 18:05.109
See, this one's
from an earlier frame,

18:05.150 --> 18:07.311
and this one's from
a later one...

18:07.350 --> 18:10.740
from your
cell phone video.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.485
Are you with the cops?

18:12.520 --> 18:15.648
Well, I've been assigned
to investigate.

18:15.690 --> 18:16.782
I erased it.

18:16.820 --> 18:18.822
The video?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.156
I don't believe you.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.895
Anyone who brags
about helping the police

18:23.930 --> 18:26.467
on their student page
isn't gonna erase anything.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.130
Look, I wasn't trying

18:32.170 --> 18:33.330
to hide anything
from the police.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.836
I know you weren't.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.270
It's just I'd never done it
before.

18:38.310 --> 18:39.709
Done what?

18:39.750 --> 18:41.877
JENNY (over video):
Okay, Tim,

18:41.920 --> 18:44.286
I do this for you...

18:44.320 --> 18:47.517
you do this for me.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.927
I was_ drunk. _
We were just sextIng.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.325
If my parents saw this...

18:52.360 --> 18:53.497
It's okay.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.191
We don't need to tell them.

18:57.730 --> 19:00.198
Josh went up
before the gunshot.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.264
What?

19:01.300 --> 19:02.699
Josh went up before
the gunshot.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.139
He said he went
up afterwards.

19:09.780 --> 19:11.873
(gunshot)

19:13.650 --> 19:16.278
(multiple footsteps)

19:20.590 --> 19:22.649
(sobbing)

19:22.690 --> 19:24.521
MAN:
Oh, my God!

19:24.560 --> 19:26.551
JOSH:
We need to get out of here.

19:26.590 --> 19:28.490
KALINDA:
Who's Josh talking to?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.820
Who's that?

19:32.870 --> 19:34.735
I've seen him
at the gym.

19:34.770 --> 19:36.431
Josh is always hanging
out with him.

19:36.470 --> 19:39.837
I think he's on the coaching
staff or something.

19:39.870 --> 19:42.634
This guy. Who is he?

19:42.680 --> 19:45.740
Oh, Ernie Suarez, assistant
to the athletic director.

19:45.780 --> 19:48.248
Does he have a locker here--
ErnIe?

19:48.280 --> 19:50.919
Yeah, a coach locker, but he
hasn't cleared it out yet.

19:50.950 --> 19:52.315
It's right there.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.717
You got the keys?

19:54.760 --> 19:57.388
Um, don't you need a
warrant or something?

19:57.430 --> 19:58.783
Yeah, if I were a cop.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.422
I can get bolt cutters
in here,

20:00.460 --> 20:03.224
but it'd be easier
if you just opened it.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.328
So you're not a cop?

20:04.370 --> 20:05.621
No.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.262
And you're not with
campus police?
Mm-mm.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.359
So who are you?

20:09.400 --> 20:11.209
Kalinda.

20:14.010 --> 20:15.671
(keys jingle)

20:21.320 --> 20:24.585
Whoa.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.851
Someone's been busy.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.297
Campus police checked
the serial number
on the computers.

20:39.330 --> 20:41.469
They're from a series
of 30 campus burglaries

20:41.500 --> 20:43.036
over the last year.
Good.

20:43.070 --> 20:44.037
So the narrative is this:

20:44.070 --> 20:45.002
Josh killed Heather

20:45.040 --> 20:47.372
after she discovered him
burglarizing her room.

20:47.410 --> 20:50.277
Mm-hmm. Listen, I'm
gonna go catch a ride
with campus police

20:50.310 --> 20:51.948
when they go check Josh's
room for more stolen goods.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.379
Good.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.342
Is that our
ballistics expert?

20:56.480 --> 20:58.345
_ We'l|_see._
I'm InterVIewmg hIm now.

20:58.390 --> 20:59.812
(clattering)

20:59.850 --> 21:02.614
God help us.

21:04.060 --> 21:05.982
What's going on?
What?

21:06.030 --> 21:07.429
...is going on?

21:07.460 --> 21:09.018
Will doesn't even
look at you anymore.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.789
He does.

21:10.830 --> 21:12.991
You been a bad girl?

21:15.670 --> 21:16.967
Going now.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.571
(sighs)

21:20.610 --> 21:22.669
(N EWSCASTER:
In other news,

21:22.710 --> 21:25.304
Sarah Palin spoke
to party members in Texas

21:25.350 --> 21:26.977
as part of her nationwide tour.

21:27.010 --> 21:31.583
(volume increases):
Palin_took aim at the President
agaIn over natIonal securIty.

21:31.620 --> 21:33.952
We need a commander in chief,

21:33.990 --> 21:36.788
not a professor of law
standing at the lectern.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.321
America is ready...

21:38.360 --> 21:40.351
(turns off TV)

21:41.700 --> 21:43.361
(sighs)

21:43.400 --> 21:45.368
So, Professor, you're saying
this is consistent

21:45.400 --> 21:48.335
with the prosecution witness,
Josh Mundy, firing the weapon

21:48.370 --> 21:49.337
that killed the victim?

21:49.370 --> 21:51.759
Yes. This is... Yes, I am.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.472
Even without evidence of
gunshot residue on his hands?

21:54.510 --> 21:55.807
Yes, that's right.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.501
Could you explain?

21:57.550 --> 21:58.949
Well, yes, I, um...

22:00.750 --> 22:02.968
Uh, let's see, uh...

22:03.020 --> 22:04.089
Here we go.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.680
So the path of the bullet,

22:06.720 --> 22:07.880
um...
(clattering)

22:07.920 --> 22:08.989
Darn it.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.124
MAN:
The gun was at chest level,

22:11.160 --> 22:14.129
held by someone
as tall as the accused,

22:14.160 --> 22:17.391
and was shot
from three feet away.

22:17.430 --> 22:18.624
The defense ballistic expert--

22:18.670 --> 22:20.968
when he finally got his
laser pointer working...
Objection.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.366
Withdrawn.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.037
He argued that
the gunshot residue

22:25.070 --> 22:26.799
found on Bianca Price's hands

22:26.840 --> 22:29.604
could have come from her
contact with the victim.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.369
Does that seem likely to you?

22:31.410 --> 22:32.377
No.

22:32.410 --> 22:34.446
I don't know.

22:34.480 --> 22:38.519
Two experts say the exact
opposite thing,

22:38.550 --> 22:40.586
and they're both
100% certain.

22:40.620 --> 22:43.009
So what do we
do with that?

22:43.060 --> 22:46.086
There was this CSI: New York,
where the gun residue

22:46.130 --> 22:49.099
was transferred
from one person to another.

22:49.130 --> 22:50.825
They say it happens
all the time.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.428
But that's TV.

22:52.470 --> 22:54.438
Yeah, but I've heard
it some other place.
Me, too.

22:54.470 --> 22:56.597
So it's not impossible.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.937
It's also weird how
little there is,

22:57.970 --> 22:59.835
you know, physical evidence.

22:59.870 --> 23:01.178
There's the GSR.

23:01.210 --> 23:02.768
Yeah, but what about
the forensic stuff?

23:02.810 --> 23:05.142
The DNA?

23:05.180 --> 23:07.648
So, wait, you two
are changing your minds?

23:09.550 --> 23:11.086
So, let's take
another vote.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.112
All those in favor
of not guilty.

23:16.820 --> 23:18.048
Okay, six to six.

23:18.090 --> 23:19.455
Yeah, but it's
a different six,

23:19.490 --> 23:21.128
so that's progress.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.663
MAN:
Campus police. Coming in.

23:26.170 --> 23:28.434
All right, go ahead,
check it out.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.461
(indistinct radio transmission)

23:36.010 --> 23:37.875
(camera shutter clicks)

23:51.990 --> 23:53.821
Anything?

23:54.860 --> 23:57.055
Is your plan
just to follow me?

23:57.100 --> 23:59.864
Yep. It's the only way
I can get more from you
than you from me.

23:59.900 --> 24:02.130
What's up?

24:04.270 --> 24:08.832
Josh finishes his threesome,
goes downstairs to get a beer

24:08.880 --> 24:12.077
in his shirtsleeves.

24:12.110 --> 24:13.099
Where did you get this?

24:13.150 --> 24:14.708
Josh heads
back upstairs.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.672
Bianca in the bathroom
hears the gunshot.

24:16.720 --> 24:20.508
Everybody runs up
and seconds later,
as if by magic,

24:20.560 --> 24:21.185
Josh in his leather jacket.

24:21.220 --> 24:23.188
Mm-hmm. He's cold.

24:23.220 --> 24:25.222
He puts on a jacket,
it happens.

24:25.260 --> 24:28.991
Or he uses it to cover the
gunshot residue off his hands.

24:29.030 --> 24:30.497
Are you writing fiction
these days?

24:30.530 --> 24:33.636
There's only one way
to find out.

24:33.670 --> 24:35.228
Check that for gunshot residue.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.949
Where would I go?

24:44.980 --> 24:47.574
CARY:
What do you mean?

24:47.620 --> 24:49.076
What prison?

24:49.120 --> 24:51.281
Dwight Correctional Center.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.810
Is that big?

24:52.850 --> 24:55.250
I don't know.

25:00.260 --> 25:04.196
We've got a really good case.
I know.

25:04.230 --> 25:09.532
Just the people at school,
they don't visit.

25:09.570 --> 25:12.266
If my roommate were in prison,
I guess I wouldn't either.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.231
I don't know.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.305
45 years.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.012
That's a worst-case scenario.

25:21.050 --> 25:23.610
Would you visit me?

25:25.290 --> 25:27.246
Yes.

25:27.290 --> 25:28.951
Thank you.

25:30.590 --> 25:32.922
I'm being stupid.

25:32.960 --> 25:33.949
No.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.525
No, you're not
being stupid.

25:41.070 --> 25:43.334
DIANE:
This silently stoic thing--

25:43.370 --> 25:45.702
that's all just
a pose, right?

25:45.740 --> 25:48.971
When you get home, you
start spouting Proust?

25:49.010 --> 25:51.649
Yep.
(chuckles)

25:51.680 --> 25:53.341
Yep.

25:53.380 --> 25:55.575
Well, to cowboys.

25:55.620 --> 25:58.589
Who knew I loved cowboys?

26:00.860 --> 26:01.986
Maybe it's in our DNA.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.351
Part of being American.

26:03.390 --> 26:06.325
You don't need
to talk like that.

26:08.030 --> 26:11.659
I do need to talk like that,
because that's how I talk.

26:16.770 --> 26:20.331
You know, there's a selfishness
to the silence of the cowboy--

26:20.370 --> 26:24.306
forcing everybody else to carry
the weight of the conversation.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.095
Whew, what am I doing?

26:44.130 --> 26:45.893
No, I mean, really,
what am I doing?

26:45.930 --> 26:47.693
You're having dinner.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.389
(sighs)

26:49.440 --> 26:52.637
I mean, you like Sarah Palin,
and H...

26:52.670 --> 26:54.877
I think she's
the devil incarnate.

26:54.910 --> 26:57.378
Yep.

26:57.410 --> 26:58.968
And choice--

26:59.010 --> 27:01.319
I mean, how can you be
for back alley abortions?

27:01.350 --> 27:03.375
The murder of 1.2...

27:03.420 --> 27:05.945
Don't-don't talk.

27:05.990 --> 27:07.981
Stoically silent?

27:11.330 --> 27:13.696
I can't.

27:13.730 --> 27:14.719
I can't, I'm sorry.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.625
I want to, but I-I can't.

27:18.370 --> 27:19.792
You have to go?

27:19.830 --> 27:22.663
I want to stay,

27:22.700 --> 27:25.260
but three generations
of Democratic ancestors

27:25.310 --> 27:27.301
are screaming out
in protest.

27:27.340 --> 27:30.036
That's a lot of generations.

27:51.470 --> 27:52.767
I hope it's good.

27:52.800 --> 27:53.994
We're struggling here.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.337
KA|__IN DA:
PotentIally good.

27:55.370 --> 27:58.464
They found gunshot residue
on Josh's jacket.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.807
His... Where are you?

27:59.840 --> 28:01.205
Police station.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.379
Listen, they found something
else on it, too--

28:03.410 --> 28:04.707
Heather's blood.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.469
They're interrogating
Josh now.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.410
Okay, I'll have to get
a continuance.

28:09.450 --> 28:11.748
You may not have to.
The cops are all over this.

28:11.790 --> 28:14.156
Look, I'm outside
the interrogation room.

28:14.190 --> 28:15.851
Phone me when you get something.

28:15.890 --> 28:18.029
I'll call the troops,
we'll line up the witnesses.

28:18.060 --> 28:19.823
A different ballistics expert.

28:19.860 --> 28:21.327
Ahead of you.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.307
What?

28:32.340 --> 28:33.830
(sighs)

28:33.880 --> 28:35.905
Malt ball?

28:36.910 --> 28:39.447
What happened, Burton?

28:39.480 --> 28:40.344
Mmm.

28:43.950 --> 28:46.384
Well, he did burglarize
those dorm rooms.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.388
He was actually
in league with Heather.

28:48.420 --> 28:50.251
They were planning
to rob your client.

28:50.290 --> 28:51.427
Makes sense.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.348
Trying to kill
his cohort in crime.

28:53.390 --> 28:54.891
And the lab
coanrms

28:54.930 --> 28:57.490
that is GSR on the jacket
and Heather's blood.

28:57.530 --> 29:00.067
Okay...

29:00.100 --> 29:03.433
I'm not seeing how
this is bad yet.

29:03.470 --> 29:05.461
Well, it's not-- for me.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.159
The blood
and the GSR

29:07.210 --> 29:09.474
were on the inside
lining of the jacket.

29:09.510 --> 29:11.398
So he wrapped it around
his shooting hand.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.044
Josh said the jacket
was on the floor of the bedroom.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.173
He heard the shot,
got into the room,

29:16.220 --> 29:18.780
grabbed the jacket from
between Bianca and Heather,

29:18.820 --> 29:20.959
put it on
and wore it home.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.218
Because he's guilty.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.956
Yes... of burglary.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.024
I'm not an advocate here,
Kalinda.

29:29.060 --> 29:30.925
I don't lie
to make things better

29:30.970 --> 29:32.164
for a client.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.861
I just look
at the facts.

29:33.900 --> 29:36.334
And the facts are against you.

29:36.370 --> 29:39.237
Right.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.087
(phone ringing)

29:53.920 --> 29:55.387
Oh.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.910
Yeah.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.848
Oh, sorry, Alicia.
It's late, I know.

29:59.890 --> 30:02.324
No, no, no, no, I'm up.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.965
Look, we ran into a problem
with the narrative.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.321
I think we may need to put
Bianca on the stand.

30:07.370 --> 30:10.589
I thought Kalinda had something.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.232
It didn't pan out.

30:12.270 --> 30:14.374
Do you think you'll be able
to handle questioning her?

30:14.410 --> 30:15.479
Yes.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.810
We're in a weird place, I know.

30:26.550 --> 30:28.188
It's okay.

30:28.220 --> 30:32.919
No. I don't like being
in a weird place.

30:35.630 --> 30:37.860
I know.

30:37.900 --> 30:40.221
Me neither.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.636
When I look at you
during the day,

30:43.670 --> 30:46.104
I want to know
what you're thinking.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.318
Sometimes I don't even know
what I'm thinking.

30:57.350 --> 31:00.979
Will...

31:01.020 --> 31:03.011
Yeah?

31:03.060 --> 31:05.551
If it had been differently...

31:07.160 --> 31:11.620
...at Georgetown, if-if it had
been us and not Peter,

31:11.670 --> 31:13.968
we would have lasted a week.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.467
No, we wouldn't have.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.990
We would have.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.931
It's romantic
because it didn't happen.

31:20.980 --> 31:25.940
If it had happened,
it would have just...

31:25.980 --> 31:27.971
been life.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.089
Will don't
say that, please.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.091
I don't understand.

31:47.130 --> 31:49.598
9mm auto-shot 6.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.268
They don't make them
anymore 'cause they
have a hair trigger.

31:52.310 --> 31:53.971
The slightest pressure
fires the mechanism.

31:54.010 --> 31:54.829
An accidental firing?

31:54.880 --> 31:57.201
Yeah, but not the one
that you'd expect.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.243
The prosecution was correct.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.044
The shot came from
three feet away.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.446
The weapon was
in the drawer

32:05.490 --> 32:07.287
of your client's bureau.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.685
Heather was a thief,

32:08.720 --> 32:09.755
and when Bianca was
in the bathroom,

32:09.790 --> 32:13.055
Heather checked the drawer
for valuables, money.

32:13.090 --> 32:14.694
Oh, my God.

32:14.730 --> 32:16.652
She checked the drawer
with the weapon...

32:18.300 --> 32:20.063
...reached in to take it,

32:20.100 --> 32:23.160
and...
(gunshot)

32:24.710 --> 32:25.608
You're kidding.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.108
The shot was fired
from three feet away,

32:28.140 --> 32:29.368
but vertically,
not horizontally.

32:29.410 --> 32:32.004
And it was accidentally
fired by Heather.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.244
There's no service
In here.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.372
And once it
was ﬁred,

32:34.420 --> 32:36.115
the gun fell to the floor.

32:36.150 --> 32:37.981
The problem was

32:38.020 --> 32:40.341
there was no blood
or gunshot reSIdue

32:40.390 --> 32:41.982
below the impact.
That's why I didn't see it.

32:42.020 --> 32:43.715
He took his jacket.
That's right.

32:43.760 --> 32:46.024
Mr. Mundy took
his leather jacket

32:46.060 --> 32:49.757
from the floor,
and that had the blood
and the GSR on it.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.097
You'll testify to this?

32:51.130 --> 32:53.223
Of course. Usual fee.

32:53.270 --> 32:56.091
WILL:
The problem is,
it's not a good story.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.301
It's just a freak accident.

32:58.340 --> 32:59.602
There are no villains.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.005
But if it's true...

33:01.040 --> 33:03.179
But it doesn't
sound true.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.041
The prosecution's story sounds
like the truth--

33:05.080 --> 33:07.378
there's a villain: Bianca,
there's a motive: jealousy.

33:07.410 --> 33:09.219
This story just says
there's no rhyme or reason.

33:09.250 --> 33:10.672
Everything's random.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.745
Well, we're not trying
to teach a lesson.

33:12.790 --> 33:13.779
Just win a verdict.
There's another problem.

33:13.820 --> 33:16.152
We've already set our story
that Josh did it.

33:16.190 --> 33:18.385
Even our own ballistics expert
supported that.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.751
Right. We'd have to contradict
our own ballistics expert.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.223
Well, there's
an another way

33:22.260 --> 33:24.592
to settle this:
ask the client.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.307
So that's what happened?

33:31.340 --> 33:33.763
That's what our ballistics
expert said happened.

33:33.810 --> 33:36.301
So, I don't know. Do we put this
new evidence on the stand

33:36.340 --> 33:38.342
or not?
Which is smarter?

33:38.380 --> 33:39.802
Well, that's up
for discussion.

33:39.850 --> 33:43.775
CARY:
Our worry is we tried one
defense with the jury,

33:43.820 --> 33:46.687
and now if we try another,
we might do two things:

33:46.720 --> 33:47.948
undercut our credibility
and hurt our chances

33:47.990 --> 33:51.255
if the jury was believing our
first defense, that Josh did it.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.155
So what should I do?

33:55.630 --> 33:56.790
You go with the truth.

33:56.830 --> 34:00.220
The truth has the advantage of
being true, and on some level,

34:00.270 --> 34:03.068
the truth is always
more believable.

34:03.100 --> 34:06.263
Then that's what
we go with, the truth.

34:06.310 --> 34:09.074
And you believe
the gunshot was self-inflicted?

34:09.110 --> 34:10.634
Well, I don't believe.

34:10.680 --> 34:12.272
The science points there.

34:12.310 --> 34:14.847
The gunshot was accidentally
self-inflicted.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.245
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.

34:16.280 --> 34:17.042
No problem.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.548
MATAN:
As you said, Mr. McVeigh,

34:19.590 --> 34:23.219
you originally didn't want
to testify in this case?

34:23.260 --> 34:26.184
Yes. I thought
Miss Price was guilty.
Right.

34:26.230 --> 34:29.358
Then two days ago
you had an epiphany?

34:29.400 --> 34:33.097
Well, if by epiphany you mean
a new piece of evidence--

34:33.130 --> 34:35.132
this jacket with bloodstain
and GSR--

34:35.170 --> 34:37.468
then yes,
I did have that.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.138
A change of heart?

34:39.170 --> 34:42.071
Not my choice of words,
but I won't object to 'em.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.172
You're staying
at the Westin

34:46.210 --> 34:47.472
while you testify
in another case?

34:47.510 --> 34:49.148
Yes.

34:49.180 --> 34:50.112
This is a hotel

34:50.150 --> 34:52.414
where many prosecutors house
their witnesses?

34:52.450 --> 34:53.883
Yes, I believe that's true.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.286
It's a hotel where several
prosecutors observed you

34:56.320 --> 34:57.309
meeting with another lawyer.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.419
Is that a question?

34:59.460 --> 35:00.427
No.

35:00.460 --> 35:03.190
Here's the question:

35:03.230 --> 35:06.324
Two nights ago before you
magically changed your mind

35:06.370 --> 35:08.531
about this case, did you have
dinner with a partner

35:08.570 --> 35:11.630
from the law firm, Stern,
Lockhart & Gardner?

35:11.670 --> 35:12.602
Yes.
Objection!

35:12.640 --> 35:14.631
The question's been answered,
Mr. Gardner.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.773
Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry, but
it was answered too quickly.

35:16.810 --> 35:19.199
Well let me overrule
just as qUIckly.

35:19.250 --> 35:23.846
And after this dinner,
the partner in question,

35:23.880 --> 35:24.847
Diane Lockhart,

35:24.890 --> 35:27.848
joined you in
your hotel room?

35:27.890 --> 35:30.415
Yes.

35:31.930 --> 35:34.353
MATAN:
And did you have
sexual relations?

35:34.400 --> 35:35.822
Objection, Your Honor!
How is this relevant?

35:35.860 --> 35:38.397
Well, I would imagine
that Mr. Brody would say

35:38.430 --> 35:41.729
that the witness's testimony
was bought these alleged

35:41.770 --> 35:44.238
sexual relations,
isn't that correct, Mr. Brody?

35:44.270 --> 35:45.259
It is, Your Honor.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.232
Well, Mr. Brody,
I will sustain

35:47.270 --> 35:49.272
Mr. Gardner's objections,

35:49.310 --> 35:51.198
but I don't think
you'll mind much

35:51.250 --> 35:54.219
because you just threw a stink
bomb into the lap of the jury,

35:54.250 --> 35:56.172
and now you're running
for cover.

35:56.220 --> 35:57.847
Your Honor,
this is an instance...

35:57.880 --> 35:59.211
And, Mr. Gardner, yes,

35:59.250 --> 36:01.218
I see the outrage on your face,

36:01.260 --> 36:04.286
which I might be more moved by
if you hadn't done

36:04.330 --> 36:06.525
the exact same thing with
Detective Burton's testimony.

36:06.560 --> 36:07.754
Excuse me,
Your Honor,

36:07.790 --> 36:09.951
with all clues respect...
Please, Your Honor...

36:10.000 --> 36:10.898
No, no, no.

36:10.930 --> 36:14.297
This one we're calling a draw,
gentlemen.

36:14.340 --> 36:17.195
You have both been playing
fast and loose

36:17.240 --> 36:19.708
with implications,
not facts, so we're gonna

36:19.740 --> 36:22.231
try and let justice
take care of itself.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.441
You have any more questions,
Mr. Brody?

36:24.480 --> 36:25.674
No, Your Honor,

36:25.710 --> 36:27.644
but we do request
a limiting instruction.

36:27.680 --> 36:30.376
Members of the jury,
in weighing

36:30.420 --> 36:33.844
Mr. McVeigh's testimony, you may
consider any potential bias

36:33.890 --> 36:39.385
in assessing the weight you want
to give to what he had to say.

36:41.730 --> 36:45.325
You know, I think
it's almost medieval.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.361
They toss us in here,
they lock the door,

36:47.400 --> 36:49.868
they throw a lot of
contradictory evidence at us,

36:49.900 --> 36:51.868
and then they expect us
to come up with a fair decision.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.468
I mean, come on.

36:54.540 --> 36:57.236
So...

36:58.910 --> 37:01.003
...shall we take another vote?

37:01.050 --> 37:02.870
DIANE: I am finished
with this conversation.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.808
You're in my office.
WILL:
You don't have the courtesy...

37:04.850 --> 37:06.249
You don't understand what
you did to this firm.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.781
Okay, I'm getting
out of here.
Did it even occur
to you to tell me?

37:08.820 --> 37:10.913
No, it didn't. I was under
the mistaken impression

37:10.960 --> 37:12.450
that it was my life.
It's your life

37:12.490 --> 37:14.299
_ when it doesn't
Impact our c|Ients.

37:14.330 --> 37:16.298
It didn' impact
our clients.

37:16.330 --> 37:17.251
Diane, the jury
ate it up.

37:17.300 --> 37:20.326
It was sex. It wasn't GSR

37:20.370 --> 37:21.769
or ballistics,
it was sex.

37:21.800 --> 37:22.994
I'm going home.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.029
If you had just told me.

37:24.070 --> 37:25.264
If you had just
given me a sign!

37:25.310 --> 37:27.665
Come on. Come on.

37:27.710 --> 37:30.031
Don't be a hypocrite.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.446
A hypocrite?
How am I a hypocrite?

37:34.350 --> 37:35.476
Alicia.

37:40.920 --> 37:44.651
That's supposed to what,
make me quake,

37:44.690 --> 37:46.055
make me humble?

37:46.090 --> 37:47.523
Make you honest.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.425
There's nothing going on
with Alicia.

37:49.460 --> 37:50.791
That's not true.

37:50.830 --> 37:51.865
It is true.

37:51.900 --> 37:53.993
Will... I have two eyes.

37:54.030 --> 37:55.497
Then use them.

37:55.540 --> 37:56.598
Watch me.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.699
Watch us.

37:58.740 --> 38:00.833
There's nothing going on
with Alicia.

38:03.110 --> 38:04.941
(chuckles)

38:06.110 --> 38:07.941
Turn out the lights.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.933
ALICIA:
Prosecution's come in
with a last-minute offer:

38:28.970 --> 38:29.959
second-degree murder,
ten years.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.104
WILL:
We don't have
a lot of time.

38:32.140 --> 38:35.906
When the verdict comes in,
the offer goes away.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.532
You'd be 34 years old, baby.

38:37.580 --> 38:38.569
You'd still...

38:38.610 --> 38:41.511
you'd still have a life.

38:41.550 --> 38:43.017
But if they find you guilty...

38:43.050 --> 38:45.484
45 years, no parole.

38:47.750 --> 38:49.058
2055. H...

38:49.090 --> 38:50.648
What do you think?

38:56.800 --> 38:58.563
I think you didn't do it...

38:58.600 --> 38:59.862
and the jury will see that.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.697
Really?

39:01.740 --> 39:02.832
Yes.

39:02.870 --> 39:04.963
You only need one juror.

39:06.810 --> 39:09.506
Yes, but if you're wrong,
you'll go back to work,

39:09.540 --> 39:11.508
and I watch my daught...

39:11.550 --> 39:14.110
Oh, my God, I can't do this.

39:15.950 --> 39:18.009
I know.

39:18.050 --> 39:20.109
MR_S. PRICE: _
Can you gIve us a mInute?

39:32.430 --> 39:33.761
Mom... (sobbing)

39:33.800 --> 39:35.734
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

39:40.870 --> 39:43.703
Listen, listen, they were just
arguing the opposite!

39:43.740 --> 39:44.707
Which they're
allowed to.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.900
They're the defense.

39:46.950 --> 39:48.645
But two ballistic experts,
one saying one thing,

39:48.680 --> 39:49.840
the other saying...
They're the defense.

39:49.880 --> 39:53.008
The whole point is to poke holes
in the prosecution's case.

39:53.050 --> 39:54.915
Yes, but this
ballistics expert

39:54.960 --> 39:56.814
said two days ago
he thought one thing,

39:56.860 --> 39:57.952
now he's thinking another--

39:57.990 --> 39:59.924
Right! And what if
in three days more

39:59.960 --> 40:01.848
he thinks something else?

40:06.870 --> 40:07.996
Hey, Doc,

40:08.030 --> 40:10.692
you look depleted.

40:10.740 --> 40:12.958
(chuckles)
I guess I am.

40:13.010 --> 40:14.102
I don't know.

40:14.140 --> 40:17.701
I sit here listening
to everybody talk,

40:17.740 --> 40:21.540
and I just feel like we weren't
given enough information.

40:25.790 --> 40:29.556
So what do we do?

40:31.260 --> 40:35.151
Do you have
reasonable doubt?

40:37.230 --> 40:39.869
I don't know.

40:39.900 --> 40:42.494
I just have...

40:42.540 --> 40:44.428
reasonable ignorance.

40:59.550 --> 41:01.245
Kalinda,
we've got a problem.

41:01.290 --> 41:03.758
The bailiff's warning
that the verdict's coming in.

41:03.790 --> 41:04.654
Okay.

41:04.690 --> 41:06.829
Bianca and her mother
want to talk to us.

41:06.860 --> 41:07.827
Oh, no.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.020
Yep. Where's Cary?
We need Cary.

41:09.060 --> 41:09.890
Why?

41:09.930 --> 41:11.989
She likes him.
Maybe he can talk to her.

41:12.030 --> 41:13.122
Okay.

41:16.540 --> 41:18.963
Okay...

41:19.010 --> 41:19.965
We're unanimous.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.102
Oh!
Yes!

41:21.140 --> 41:23.904
Finally. Good job.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.544
Democracy in action.

41:25.580 --> 41:28.572
All for $15 a day.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.872
I bet a lot of jurors trade
numbers and say

41:30.920 --> 41:32.785
they'll stay in touch,
but I bet nobody does.

41:32.820 --> 41:36.711
Why don't we just save time
and not trade numbers?

41:36.760 --> 41:37.715
CUESTA:
Hello. Hi.

41:37.760 --> 41:38.784
Hello, Judge.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.855
I thought I'd just join you
in here

41:40.890 --> 41:42.699
and thank you for your service.

41:42.730 --> 41:46.063
Unfortunately,
I now need to excuse you

41:46.100 --> 41:47.920
and thank you for your service.

41:47.970 --> 41:50.939
What did we do?

41:50.970 --> 41:53.029
Nothing.
You did your job well.

41:53.070 --> 41:54.537
This happens sometimes,

41:54.580 --> 41:56.707
and there's no way
to prepare for it.

41:56.740 --> 41:59.243
The prosecution and defense
have agreed to a plea bargain

41:59.280 --> 42:01.009
just seconds ago.

42:01.050 --> 42:02.278
You're kidding me?

42:02.320 --> 42:03.309
No, I'm sorry, I'm not.

42:03.350 --> 42:04.908
This happens sometimes

42:04.950 --> 42:08.954
when one side or the other
worries about the outcome.

42:08.990 --> 42:11.049
So again, thank you.

42:11.090 --> 42:13.957
I hope this doesn't diminish
your enthusiasm

42:13.990 --> 42:15.799
for the court system

42:15.830 --> 42:19.129
because in another year you're
gonna get another summons.

42:21.170 --> 42:23.297
(clears throat)

42:24.810 --> 42:26.766
So what happened?

42:26.810 --> 42:28.607
What was the
plea bargaIn?

42:28.640 --> 42:30.073
Oh. Miss Price

42:30.110 --> 42:32.977
agreed to a charge
of second-degree murder.

42:33.010 --> 42:36.116
Ten years.

42:36.150 --> 42:38.072
Thanks again.
