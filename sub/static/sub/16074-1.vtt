(male voice)
I'm very honored
to introduce

00:58.767 --> 01:00.768
our guest lecturer today.

01:00.853 --> 01:04.355
He graduated from here
about 15 years ago.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.316
He's gone on
to a fabulous career.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.361
I can't think
of a single person
who's more qualified

01:10.446 --> 01:13.614
or more adept
at the final procedures

01:13.699 --> 01:16.659
you've been
studying lately.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.327
Now you've
learned the science,

01:18.412 --> 01:22.165
now's your chance
to learn the art.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.710
Students, Mr. Bernie Tiede.

01:27.004 --> 01:31.340
Thank you, Professor.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.009
Thank you.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.886
It's always an
honor to be
asked back

01:34.970 --> 01:37.472
and I do it gladly
because I feel...

01:37.556 --> 01:39.474
if even one thing I say
or demonstrate today

01:39.558 --> 01:42.977
helps you in any way
as you embark
on your careers,

01:43.061 --> 01:45.188
then everyone
will have benefited.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.858
You, those
who are grieving,

01:48.942 --> 01:50.943
and the deceased.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.947
The nails have to be clipped,

01:55.032 --> 01:57.283
shaped and brought
back to life.

01:57.367 --> 02:01.204
And you must cast
the nails to the person.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.830
You wouldn't
want a mechanic

02:02.915 --> 02:03.998
to have the nails
of a flight attendant.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.124
Would you?

[Blows quickly]

02:07.711 --> 02:09.753
[Machine buzzing]

02:09.838 --> 02:11.839
It is very important
to remove any
unwanted nasal,

02:11.924 --> 02:16.385
ear, or facial hair.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.387
We can never be too vigilant

02:18.472 --> 02:24.018
in the lookout for that
one stray rogue hair.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.520
[Blows]

02:25.604 --> 02:27.396
The eyes are often
a minor problem

02:27.481 --> 02:29.607
because they usually
want to stay open.

02:29.691 --> 02:34.153
It's almost like
they want one last look
at this miraculous world.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.405
But with some Super Glue...

02:36.490 --> 02:39.075
a little dab will do you...

02:39.159 --> 02:42.578
and it's no more peeking.

02:42.663 --> 02:46.958
Even though the features
have been set during
the embalming,

02:47.042 --> 02:48.960
you have
to reassess
and readjust

02:49.044 --> 02:56.217
because of continuing
emaciation and dehydration.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.302
Perfect expression
of the mouth

02:58.387 --> 03:01.848
would be relaxed, natural,
with a little bit
of a smile.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.767
Can't have him looking
unhappy to be there.

03:04.852 --> 03:08.729
And we must always be on guard
for the mischievous lip drift.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.941
Even the slightest
hint of teeth can
be disastrous.

03:12.025 --> 03:17.613
You cannot have grief
tragically become
a comedy.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.324
Then, after a foundation

03:20.409 --> 03:24.620
mixed with massage cream
to prevent dehydration,

03:24.705 --> 03:26.789
even out coloration,

03:26.874 --> 03:29.792
then apply highlights.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.044
Do not over-cosmetize.

03:32.129 --> 03:35.298
Most of those who service
the deceased apply far
too much blush.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.341
Just a note
to always remember:

03:37.426 --> 03:40.553
Too much color
does not make one
look more alive.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.430
The last detail
to be managed

03:42.514 --> 03:45.224
is the deceased's
body position.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.518
Left hand over the right,

03:47.603 --> 03:50.521
over the umbilicus,
in an attitude of ease,

03:50.606 --> 03:52.607
of repose, of retirement.

03:52.691 --> 03:56.027
The position of the head
is oh so important.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.695
Neither star gazing

03:57.779 --> 03:59.238
nor navel gazing,

03:59.323 --> 04:00.823
but perfectly centered,

04:00.908 --> 04:03.659
turned ever so slightly
to the right...

04:03.744 --> 04:05.328
in greeting.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.748
He's now been cosmetized,

04:08.832 --> 04:10.708
he's ready to be dressed,

04:10.792 --> 04:13.961
and casketed.

Carthage is in east Texas.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.919
And it's totally different
from the rest of Texas,

07:00.003 --> 07:04.507
which could be
five different
states, actually.

07:04.591 --> 07:09.804
You got your west Texas
out there with a bunch
of flat ranches.

07:09.888 --> 07:15.559
U p north, you got
them Dallas snobs
with their Mercedes,

07:15.644 --> 07:18.813
and then you got Houston,
the carcinogenic coast

07:18.897 --> 07:22.441
all the way up to Louisiana.

07:22.526 --> 07:25.694
Then down south,
San Antonio, uh,

07:25.779 --> 07:28.906
that's where the Tex
meets the Mex.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.200
Like the food.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.827
And then in central Texas,

07:32.911 --> 07:36.205
you got the People's
Republic of Austin

07:36.289 --> 07:40.626
with a bunch of hairy-legged
women and liberal fruitcakes.

07:40.710 --> 07:45.589
Of course, I left out
the panhandle, and a
lot of people do, but...

where the south begins.

behind the pine curtain.

in The Best Small Towns
of America, Volume Two

looking for some help.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.307

more like a church
or a sacred place,

12:47.392 --> 12:49.476
less like
a business
or an office.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.104
Were you thinking
interment or cremation?

12:52.188 --> 12:53.439
I beg
your pardon?

12:53.523 --> 12:55.149
He means
buried or burned.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.359
Buried. We already
have the plots.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.111
I am so happy for you.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.113
Can I tell you,
I am not fond
of cremations.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.574
I just don't like the idea
of someone spending eternity

13:03.658 --> 13:05.826
in something the size
of a motel ice bucket.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.786
I'd just soon drop
you in a ditch

13:07.871 --> 13:08.871
by the side
of the road.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.205
Hey.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.540
I want to keep
it simple.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.375
Yeah, this is... this is fine.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.586
- I see.
- Yeah.

mostly to the county

the indigent,

and also no

our better caskets,

13:26.723 --> 13:28.682

that your remains

Oh, dear.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.737
These economy boxes
are not very large.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.406
We may have to make
a leg adjustment
to get a proper fit.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.325

13:46.409 --> 13:48.243

necessarily break
the legs but definitely

she hadn't talked

16:10.303 --> 16:12.804

in over 20 years

16:12.889 --> 16:14.514

the mother died,

she was right in
there fightin' them

even wanted to donate
land to the church,

out in Middleton,
almost never came to visit.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.464
One of his daughters
had actually sued
her grandparents

16:47.548 --> 16:49.800
trying to get at
the money in that trust.

16:49.884 --> 16:53.095

she was born old.

to do this and

18:28.274 --> 18:30.317
he wasn't getting
paid to do it,

18:30.401 --> 18:32.110
but he would always stop by
and check on the widows

18:32.195 --> 18:33.862

their husbands' funerals.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.043
I gotta tell you, Bernie,

22:58.127 --> 22:59.711
you have got to be
about the bravest
man in this town.

22:59.795 --> 23:02.088
She isn't all that mean
like everyone says.

23:02.173 --> 23:03.631
Now you sure
about that?

23:03.716 --> 23:05.467
Well, she doesn't
have anyone, Don.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.470
She's a very
Ionely person.
She needs someone.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.388
I've asked her
to accompany me
this Saturday

23:10.473 --> 23:12.974
to the Van Clyburn
Piano Competition
in Fort Worth.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.310
Well, have fun.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.771
Ain't like she's
the richest widow
in town.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.731
Hell, maybe she'll
even pay for everything.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.900
- Don!
- Hey...

23:21.984 --> 23:24.652
And if she does offer
to pay for everything,

23:24.737 --> 23:27.447
order up a couple
of them bottles
of Dom Perignon.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.990
You get her
liquored up,

23:29.075 --> 23:30.075
[whispering]
You might get lucky.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.452
No, Don!

23:32.536 --> 23:35.747
He sincerely believed that...

23:35.831 --> 23:39.125
it was better to give
than to receive.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.294
Well, Bernie had
a problem with money.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.631
He was generous.
Some folks say
overly generous.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.217
What he was
was a buy-aholic.

23:47.301 --> 23:49.844
And, uh... hell, he'd
walk into a store,

23:49.929 --> 23:52.347
seen something he liked,
he'd buy the store

23:52.431 --> 23:54.516
out of every goddamn
item he wanted

23:54.600 --> 23:56.017
and give the shit away.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.852
And that's crazy.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.687
But that Bernie,
he liked to make
people smile.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.356
He wanted friends.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.024
Acceptance, I guess,
is what you call it.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.735
And Bernie could do
just about anything.

24:05.820 --> 24:09.280
I mean, he
could hang wallpaper
in people's houses,

24:09.365 --> 24:11.950
and I've never seen
any man do this,

24:12.034 --> 24:14.285
but he could make
curtains for people

24:14.370 --> 24:16.496
and he was
the head honcho

24:16.580 --> 24:18.581
for the Chamber of Commerce

24:18.666 --> 24:20.750
Christmas
decorating committee.

24:20.835 --> 24:23.586
That's a big thing
in Carthage, too,
a big thing.

24:23.671 --> 24:25.421
Bernie was really smart.

24:25.506 --> 24:28.091
He helped people do
their tax returns,
you know,

24:28.175 --> 24:30.009
financial counseling...

24:30.094 --> 24:31.928
Anything that you
pay for on the job

24:32.012 --> 24:34.097
that the company,
the oil company

24:34.181 --> 24:36.266
doesn't reimburse you for,
that's a tax deduction.

24:36.350 --> 24:39.394
So, for instance, Toby,
these work coveralls,

24:39.478 --> 24:40.895
did the company
provide you with these?

24:40.980 --> 24:42.605
No, we got
to buy our own.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.150
Bingo. That is
a tax deduction.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.068
And how about
your lunch buckets

24:47.153 --> 24:48.695
and your steel
toe workboots,
they give you those?

24:48.779 --> 24:50.738
- Why, hell no.
- That's what I thought.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.407
- You kidding me?
- U h-uh.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.242
That's tax deduction
number two and three.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.327

Thank you, Sheriff Huckabee.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.705
You're listening to KGAS,
the heartbeat of East Texas.

24:58.789 --> 25:01.207
Now before we
get to the school
cafeteria menu,

25:01.292 --> 25:03.877
and the wedding
anniversaries
for the week,

25:03.961 --> 25:07.380
here's Bernie Tiede
from Leggett Funeral Home.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.465
Thank you, Jerry.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.301
As some of you
are already aware,

25:11.385 --> 25:13.261
Mr. Harvey Gunnolds
left this world
all too soon

25:13.345 --> 25:15.889
this past
Wednesday after a
brief hospital stay.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.057
I used to love having
him on the air.

25:18.142 --> 25:22.395
I mean, every Friday
people would tune in
just to hear Bernie.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.647
And when he
did the obituaries,

25:24.732 --> 25:28.151
it wasn't like a so-and-so
was survived by so-and-so
kind of thing.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.320
It was... let's see
if I can remember...

25:30.404 --> 25:33.698
Left in sorrow
to mourn the passing
of the beloved Mr. Gunnolds

25:33.782 --> 25:36.242
are Mima Gunnolds,
his mother, Georgia...

25:36.327 --> 25:39.996
And the way he would
make them "look good"
in death,

25:40.080 --> 25:42.165
well, he'd make
them sound good, too.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.751
Like Gunnolds was a drunk,

25:44.835 --> 25:46.961
always startin' shit
wherever he went.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.797
He finally got himself
killed in a pool hall.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.300
Now how do you say
something nice about
somebody like that?

25:52.384 --> 25:55.637
Well, to Bernie,
it was, "He was known..."

25:55.721 --> 25:57.555
- for his social
engagements and his...

25:57.640 --> 25:59.140
conversational abilities...

25:59.225 --> 26:02.268
A kid would wrap
his car around a tree

26:02.353 --> 26:04.103
and with Bernie
it was...

26:04.188 --> 26:06.814
- and yet, death slipped
up on young Mr. Shotwell,

26:06.899 --> 26:08.816
as gentle
as a fallen mist.

26:08.901 --> 26:15.365
[Crowd murmuring]

26:15.449 --> 26:17.575

What happened?

26:17.660 --> 26:20.787
[Inaudible dialog]

26:28.545 --> 26:31.339
I regret to inform you

26:31.423 --> 26:36.010
that four of your classmates
have just been killed.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.720
Now this is gonna
happen to you

26:37.805 --> 26:41.266
if you drink and drive.

26:41.350 --> 26:44.769
Is this what you want
to happen to you?

26:44.853 --> 26:47.855
(female voice)
It didn't make no
difference what it was

26:47.940 --> 26:50.525
or who ask it, if it was
good for the community,

26:50.609 --> 26:52.527
Bernie'd give
it all he had.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.737
All the time.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.198
He was very serious
about his commitment
to Carthage.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.200
Life is so beautiful,

26:59.285 --> 27:01.035
every moment a miracle,

27:01.120 --> 27:03.037
and yet in
a blink it's gone.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.832
Too young.
[Inaudible]

27:05.916 --> 27:08.167
[Shouts to crowd]
Too young!

27:08.252 --> 27:12.005
Oh, he really had
a way of bringing
the community together.

27:12.089 --> 27:14.257
Not just at
the funerals
and at the church,

27:14.341 --> 27:18.261
he organized
a "Beautify Carthage" campaign,

27:18.345 --> 27:21.389
and he put on
the very first
East Texas art festival

27:21.473 --> 27:24.309
and invited artists
from all around
the region

27:24.393 --> 27:26.644
to display their works.

are these all done
with that...

27:44.121 --> 27:45.955

that called?

27:46.040 --> 27:47.248
It's all chain saw.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.917
How do you do that?

27:50.002 --> 27:52.295
I wake up in the morning
with an idea

27:52.379 --> 27:54.589
and cut away everything
that ain't that idea.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.132
Can I talk to you
at some time?

27:56.216 --> 27:58.009
- Do you have a card?
- Yeah.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.635
Because I have
an idea I would
love to commission.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.471
I don't know if you
work that way, but...

28:01.555 --> 28:03.598
Look at that card, he
put it on a piece
of wood.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.558
- I'm gonna call you.
- Alright.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.602
- You're a gem.
- Thank you.

28:07.686 --> 28:08.895
Thank you.
Okay.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.480
- See you later.
- Bye.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.273
Oh, yeah, Bernie
took her everywhere.

28:12.358 --> 28:17.028
He took her to the
Van Clyburn Competition,

28:17.112 --> 28:18.946
took her up to
the junior college

28:19.031 --> 28:21.324
to see some of
the rehearsals of shows

28:21.408 --> 28:22.867
that he was working on.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.119

had Mrs. Nugent.

and he thought
it could be better

28:53.899 --> 28:56.317
so he volunteered
to help out

28:56.402 --> 29:00.571

he was the musical
director for one show,

They was out to lunch together,
and he reached over and kissed
her on the cheek.

29:41.655 --> 29:44.365
But it wasn't a kiss like
you give your momma
or your grandma.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.118
It was more of a romantic,
sexual kiss to me, you know?

29:47.202 --> 29:51.164
He had that graoning sound
in the back of his voice.
It was kinda strange.

29:51.248 --> 29:53.166

look right to me.

it wasn't a week
after the funeral

Mrs. Nugent gave Bernie
Mr. Nugent's $ 12,000
Rolex watch.

30:02.468 --> 30:06.304
Hell, for that kinda
money, I bet he
did kiss her.

30:06.388 --> 30:09.515
In a small town,
people will always

30:09.600 --> 30:11.976
suspect the worst
of someone.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.854
But they'll also
suspect the best.

30:14.938 --> 30:18.649
So we just thought
they were companions.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.735
Look, it was widely assumed

30:20.819 --> 30:22.236
that Mrs. Nugent
was paying Bernie

30:22.321 --> 30:25.698
to "accompany her" places.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.492
Oh, I'd
estimate they spent

30:27.576 --> 30:29.285
nearly a hundred
thousand a year
on vacations.

Acapulco, New York City.

33:32.344 --> 33:35.096
With his belt line...
above the navel.

33:35.180 --> 33:40.142
And the kicker is
he always wore sandals.

33:40.227 --> 33:42.395
Our Lord and Savior
always wore sandals

33:42.479 --> 33:44.522
and he never married.

33:44.606 --> 33:47.274
And he had 12 disciples

33:47.359 --> 33:51.404
and I don't think
any of them ever married.

33:51.488 --> 33:55.324
And the apostle Paul,
he was a lifelong bachelor.

33:55.409 --> 33:57.952
And you never heard anybody
in the New Testament

33:58.036 --> 34:01.622
say that they was
a bunch of queers.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.500
[Pfft]
No.

34:04.584 --> 34:08.462
No, he had homosexual relations.
I know that for a fact.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.380
This ain't San Francisco,

34:10.465 --> 34:14.301
so around here we got a
lot of "closet homosexuals."

34:14.386 --> 34:17.179
And I know of at least
two men that he had
relationships with

34:17.264 --> 34:19.514
that were heterosexual.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.726
Were.

34:21.810 --> 34:25.438
Now one of the main things
and why I have this job,

34:25.522 --> 34:27.773
and why I feel like
I'm good at it is,

34:27.858 --> 34:29.859
you see, I'm
naturally suspicious.

34:29.943 --> 34:34.487
Sometimes I find myself
waking up in the middle
of the night.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.282
I'll be staring off

34:36.366 --> 34:38.743
out through the backyard
into the woods and I...

34:38.827 --> 34:40.411
I'll be thinking
about all the crime
and mayhem

34:40.495 --> 34:42.788
happening out there,

34:42.873 --> 34:46.917
and that's... that's when
I start putting it
together in my mind.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.835
I stop the criminal.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.255
I wait, I watch,

34:51.339 --> 34:53.674
and I listen.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.092
When the time's just right...

34:56.178 --> 34:59.472
[fftt]
That's when I pounce.

34:59.556 --> 35:01.348
Ain't nothing I enjoy more

35:01.433 --> 35:03.225
than the sound
of a criminal
that's just wriggling

35:03.310 --> 35:05.102
on the end of my
hook, hey, you know,

35:05.187 --> 35:07.980
and folks like to see
the D.A. At work.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.399
But no county
ain't gonna hire a D.A.

35:10.484 --> 35:14.153
Who doesn't know
that this is
a full time job.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.697
All the time.

35:16.782 --> 35:20.743
One thing Danny
Bucks is good at

35:20.827 --> 35:22.828
is getting Danny
Buck re-elected.

35:22.913 --> 35:26.040
And he gets his
little photo ops
in the paper,

35:26.124 --> 35:28.959
busting up the copper rings
or the hub-cap rings,

35:29.044 --> 35:31.921
or the meth labs,
but in slow times,

35:32.005 --> 35:34.673

digging up some shit.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.258
Let me show
y'all something.

35:36.343 --> 35:39.094
You're gonna love this.

35:39.179 --> 35:43.516
I call this
my wheel of misfortune.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.018
Now what I've done is,
I've assigned numbers

35:46.102 --> 35:48.854
to all the suspected
drug dealers around here.

35:48.939 --> 35:56.570
If your number comes up,

35:56.655 --> 36:00.991
number eight, Danny
Buck's come to get
you first.

36:01.076 --> 36:04.662
And not one
of you dope pushers
is gonna get away.

36:04.746 --> 36:07.039
Not one.

36:07.123 --> 36:09.124
The best trick I ever pulled

36:09.209 --> 36:11.710
is the time I arrested
five deadbeat dads

36:11.795 --> 36:14.255
all at the same time.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.799
You see, I was having
trouble finding them.

36:16.883 --> 36:19.718
Actually, what I did
is I used the annual
hands on a hardbody contest

36:19.803 --> 36:22.596
the one at the Dodge
dealership on 79?

36:22.681 --> 36:24.348
People were standing around
for days and days

36:24.432 --> 36:26.600
with their hands
on the pick up truck,

36:26.685 --> 36:28.394
and the last one with
their hand on the
truck wins it.

36:28.478 --> 36:31.021
What I did,
is I got a rig

36:31.106 --> 36:34.441
where they invited
these five dads who
aren't paying child support.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.068
I figured the idea
of a new truck

36:36.152 --> 36:37.987
might get 'em to come
out of hiding.

36:38.071 --> 36:42.658
Did it work?

36:42.742 --> 36:44.285
You bet your butt it did.

to move some out

37:03.638 --> 37:06.307
and into technologies,
maybe a little
more Apple.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.435
And we'd like to get
a thousand shares
of Tommy Hilfiger.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.979
I got a sneak-a-peek
at the new line for the...

37:12.063 --> 37:14.940
What is this "we'd
like to" part, Bernie?

37:15.025 --> 37:16.650
What do you know
about stocks
and investing?

37:16.735 --> 37:19.153
Let me remind you:
You bury people.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.656
You're a mortician. You're
not an investment advisor.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.992
No one uses the word
"mortician" anymore, Lloyd.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.827
It's "funeral director."

37:26.912 --> 37:29.288
Or in your case
assistant funeral director.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.958

being a little conservative

Lloyd! Don't you ever,
ever speak to Bernie
like that again,

37:54.981 --> 37:56.649
or I'll be
moving my account.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.192
I'm sorry, I got
a little frustrated
and I...

Don't be sorry,
just don't do it.

threatened to sue me

46:13.771 --> 46:15.313
because everyone's
doing this right now.

46:15.398 --> 46:16.815
It's looking a little
too uniform, okay?

46:16.899 --> 46:20.026
One, two, three, four
and oh!

46:20.111 --> 46:23.155
And ho!
That's it.
Okay.

46:23.239 --> 46:24.739
Very good,
relax the pose.

46:24.824 --> 46:27.117
This is only going
to take a second.

46:27.201 --> 46:30.871
If I don't call her,
she will give me
living hell.

46:30.955 --> 46:34.249
Hello, Marjorie,
how are you?

46:34.333 --> 46:37.085
Mm-hm. Can I
bring you anything?

46:37.170 --> 46:38.628
Can it wait till
right after rehearsal?

46:38.713 --> 46:40.380
We got another 40...

46:40.465 --> 46:42.382
Okay, right away.
I'll be there.

46:42.467 --> 46:44.342
Bye-bye.
[Deep sigh]

46:44.427 --> 46:46.136
Can you clean
this up?

46:46.220 --> 46:47.471
I have to go
right away.
Thank you.

46:47.555 --> 46:49.973
[Deep sigh]

46:58.357 --> 46:59.900
(Bernie)
How's it going, Carl?

46:59.984 --> 47:01.735
Old Mrs. Nugent
just fired me.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.529
What happened?

47:04.614 --> 47:07.073
She said I stole
a lawn mower.

47:07.158 --> 47:09.576
Snuck it out
to my place
in Niggertown.

47:09.660 --> 47:11.745
What?

47:11.829 --> 47:13.163
Why does she
think that?

47:13.247 --> 47:15.874
Oh, she saw me
leave with it,

47:15.958 --> 47:18.210
I was taking it
to get it fixed.

47:18.294 --> 47:20.128
Let me talk to
her, okay Carl?

47:20.213 --> 47:21.838
Don't go getting
a new job just yet.

47:21.923 --> 47:26.676
Okay. But I ain't
going back up there.

47:26.761 --> 47:28.261
Not today anyway.

47:28.346 --> 47:30.430
I don't blame you.

47:30.515 --> 47:33.433
I will get to the bottom
of it and I will call
you back. Okay?

47:33.518 --> 47:34.935
So sorry about this.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.186
Alright.

47:40.691 --> 47:45.028
Oh, you just pop
up whenever it's
convenient for you!

47:45.112 --> 47:47.906
Just when you think
it's fine for you,

47:47.990 --> 47:50.283
you come! Well, fine
fine, fine, fine!

47:50.368 --> 47:52.035
What happened with Carl?

47:52.119 --> 47:54.287
I got rid of him!
I caught him
red handed!

47:54.372 --> 47:56.790
God knows what else
he's been stealing
from me, Bernie!

47:56.874 --> 47:58.708
He says he was
gonna get it fixed.

47:58.793 --> 48:00.502
- That's what he says.
- Well, I don't think Carl...

48:00.586 --> 48:03.755
And those flowers
he's supposedly planted,

48:03.839 --> 48:05.882
they were supposed
to bloom two weeks ago.

48:05.967 --> 48:08.927
He's a lazy good fer nothin'.
The man's never done anything!

48:09.011 --> 48:11.888
I don't think
that he would ever
do anything like...

48:11.973 --> 48:14.307
Why are you stickin'
up for his kind?

48:14.392 --> 48:17.602
Marjorie, you're making it
very hard to be your friend.

48:17.687 --> 48:19.104
I'm gonna come back
some other time.

48:19.188 --> 48:21.273
Oh, just go ahead,
desert me.

48:21.357 --> 48:23.275
Just like everybody else,
go ahead, go ahead,
go ahead, go ahead.

48:23.359 --> 48:25.235
Go, go, go!
You hate me!

48:25.319 --> 48:27.821
Marjorie, I am not
going to take part

48:27.905 --> 48:30.073
in this argument.
You know [inaudible].

48:30.157 --> 48:32.450
- I know you hate me!
- No!

48:32.535 --> 48:34.327
Like everybody else!

48:34.412 --> 48:35.412
[Tires screeching]

48:35.496 --> 48:39.291
[Whimpering]

48:39.375 --> 48:40.667
[Click]

48:45.590 --> 48:46.590
Oh.

48:53.431 --> 48:56.641
Basically, it was
like Bernie became
her property.

48:56.726 --> 49:01.229
You'll never leave me.
Never.

49:01.314 --> 49:04.482
He was her sole source
of entertainment,

49:04.567 --> 49:06.693
had to do everything for her.

49:06.777 --> 49:09.529
I truly believe
the guy felt he
was smothered, choked,

49:09.614 --> 49:11.239
unable to get his wind.

49:11.324 --> 49:15.368
I don't know
how the guy
stood it. Well.

49:15.453 --> 49:17.370
Come on, just pull
the damn trigger.

49:17.455 --> 49:19.372
I don't think
I can. It doesn't
feel aimed right.

49:19.457 --> 49:20.874
Look, look,
all I want

49:20.958 --> 49:22.375
is for you to
shoot that armadillo

49:22.460 --> 49:24.461
that is digging
up my garden, okay?

49:24.545 --> 49:26.254
I mean, is that too
much for me to ask,

49:26.339 --> 49:28.715
for you to be a man
for once in your life?

49:28.799 --> 49:30.717
[Shout]

49:30.801 --> 49:32.886
Fine.

49:32.970 --> 49:35.138
Now I'm holding
you responsible

49:35.222 --> 49:38.850
for anything getting
dug up in my garden.

49:38.934 --> 49:41.978
Okay? You go out and
fix those holes yourself.

49:42.063 --> 49:45.690
Dig one
you can fit in.

49:45.775 --> 49:49.069
Let me see.

49:49.153 --> 49:51.363
Did you go
by the cleaners
to pick up my dress?

49:51.447 --> 49:52.906
Yes, earlier.

49:52.990 --> 49:54.407
Did you lysol
my kitchen counters?

49:54.492 --> 49:56.409
Mm-hm.

49:56.494 --> 49:57.911
Did you pick up
the Preparation H
from the pharmacy?

49:57.995 --> 50:00.121
No, but I figured
we'd go by there

50:00.206 --> 50:01.581
on the way to lunch.
Do you still want to
go to Jalapeño Treat?

50:01.666 --> 50:04.959
- I guess.
- Okay, hold still.

50:05.044 --> 50:06.294
Jeez.

50:06.379 --> 50:07.712
Will you be attending

50:07.797 --> 50:10.465
our dress
rehearsal tonight?

50:10.549 --> 50:11.758
No.

50:39.704 --> 50:41.121
[Gunshot]

51:02.560 --> 51:05.270
Marjorie?

51:05.354 --> 51:07.647
Marjorie, are
you okay?

51:07.732 --> 51:09.482
Marjorie, say
something to me.

51:09.567 --> 51:11.317
Marjorie, can
you talk to me?

51:11.402 --> 51:12.652
Marjorie, can you
say something?

51:12.737 --> 51:14.279
Oh no, no,
no, no, no!

51:14.363 --> 51:18.575
Oh, Jesus, no, no,
no, what have I done?

51:18.659 --> 51:23.246
Oh, God!
What have I done?

51:23.330 --> 51:24.831
Please tell me
what to do!

51:24.915 --> 51:27.584

you want me to do!

52:31.774 --> 52:33.650
It seemed like
the flags were
a little late,

52:33.734 --> 52:37.320
also I want to make
sure that those
fleahops are right.

52:37.404 --> 52:39.280
Now I got off that time

52:39.365 --> 52:40.740
but I feel like I got off
because one of you
got off.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.659
But it was
a really great job.

52:42.743 --> 52:44.911
Take five,
we're gonna take
it again from the top.

52:44.995 --> 52:46.663
I don't think too many of us

52:46.747 --> 52:49.123
ever asked very many questions

52:49.208 --> 52:51.960
about Mrs. Nugent,
and if we did,

52:52.044 --> 52:54.921
he would always have
a very plausible explanation.

52:55.005 --> 52:57.298
Hello, Billy,
this is Bernie Tiede

52:57.383 --> 53:00.218
calling on behalf
of Mrs. Nugent.

53:00.302 --> 53:03.513
Yes, yes, she missed her
holiday haircut appointment

53:03.597 --> 53:07.809
but she's asked me
to tell you that she
won't be coming back in.

53:07.893 --> 53:12.063
She wants to try
someone else.

53:12.147 --> 53:14.148
Well, I'm sorry
to say this

53:14.233 --> 53:19.028
but she says
that you take too long
and charge too much.

53:19.113 --> 53:22.031
Billy, I'm sorry,
but I'm just
the messenger.

53:22.116 --> 53:25.535
I was rather devastated
at the very idea

53:25.619 --> 53:28.413
that she was not
coming anymore
after 30 years

53:28.497 --> 53:31.666
of being her
friend, hairdresser,

53:31.750 --> 53:35.211
confidante sometimes,

53:35.296 --> 53:38.298
and she just
was gonna vanish.

53:38.382 --> 53:41.009
(male voice)
It was easy
for her to disappear.

53:41.093 --> 53:42.677
Nobody was looking for her.

53:42.761 --> 53:45.471
Not her son,
not her two sisters.

53:45.556 --> 53:47.307
One of them
lived here in Carthage.

53:47.391 --> 53:49.309
They hadn't spoken
in about 10 years.

53:49.393 --> 53:51.811
You want to sign
this for Mrs. Nugent,

53:51.896 --> 53:53.646
our generous benefactor?

53:53.731 --> 53:55.315
Only person
looking for her
was her stockbroker.

53:55.399 --> 53:58.234
[Phone rings]

53:58.319 --> 54:01.487
Oh, God.

54:01.572 --> 54:02.614
Hello?

54:02.698 --> 54:04.324
Bernie?
Bernie!

54:04.408 --> 54:06.200
Wh... where's Marjorie?

54:06.285 --> 54:07.493
I... I... I haven't
spoken to her in
over five weeks,

54:07.578 --> 54:09.829
I've left 11 messages.

54:09.914 --> 54:11.831
She's with me
right now, Lloyd,

54:11.916 --> 54:13.499
and I'm
sorry I couldn't
tell you earlier

54:13.584 --> 54:15.668
but she's had a series
of small strokes.

54:15.753 --> 54:18.671
I've been meaning
to call you and let
you know her situation.

54:18.756 --> 54:23.968
Mm-hm. No, she should
not be attempting to talk. No.

54:24.053 --> 54:26.262
No, you can't talk.
The doctor said...

54:26.347 --> 54:30.475
She's indicating for me
to tell you hi from her.

54:30.559 --> 54:32.393
He sends you
all his best.

54:32.478 --> 54:34.312
[Sighs]
Okay, well,

54:34.396 --> 54:36.522
we'll be in touch
when she's feeling better.

54:36.607 --> 54:38.149
I n the meantime,
let me know

54:38.233 --> 54:40.151
if I can help you
with anything. Okay.

54:40.235 --> 54:43.988
Okay, bye-bye.

54:44.073 --> 54:46.866
Bernie knew better
than touch my accounts.

54:46.951 --> 54:49.994
But he was going after
what would go into her
bank accounts

54:50.079 --> 54:51.871
because that's where
all the royalty checks went.

54:51.956 --> 54:55.458
It's usually 50,000 a month.

54:55.542 --> 54:58.044
Now he really started
being generous.

54:58.128 --> 55:02.966
He paid 5,000 dollars
for the Shreveport orchestra
to come over play the Messiah.

55:03.050 --> 55:07.470
He bought a high
dollar harpsichord
for school.

55:07.554 --> 55:10.556
He paid for the choir
to go to Russia.

55:10.641 --> 55:13.685
Well, yeah, he
hired me back
for more money,

55:13.769 --> 55:16.229
which is fine with me.

55:16.313 --> 55:18.523
Oh, he bought jet skis,

55:18.607 --> 55:20.900
he bought nine cars,

55:20.985 --> 55:23.152
he bought
struggling businesses,

55:23.237 --> 55:26.906
he paid 40,000 dollars
for Carthage Awards.

55:26.991 --> 55:28.825
That's a trophy shop.

55:28.909 --> 55:31.869
He loaned the money
to the Yokums over here,

55:31.954 --> 55:34.122
that opened up
Boot Scootin
Western Wear.

55:34.206 --> 55:37.583
I guess that was
Carthage's answer
to Neiman's.

55:37.668 --> 55:40.837
Bernie just told everybody
to pay him back when
they could.

55:40.921 --> 55:42.588
You know,
pay me when you can.

55:42.673 --> 55:44.465
But they never did.

55:44.550 --> 55:46.592
Bernie knew my twin girls'
birthday was coming up,

55:46.677 --> 55:48.177
and he thought
they should have

55:48.262 --> 55:51.097
a big nice
playhouse, you know?

55:51.181 --> 55:53.266
Little girls.

55:53.350 --> 55:57.437
Bernie bought this
playhouse for my girls.

56:00.274 --> 56:05.528
Oh.
[Chuckling]

56:05.612 --> 56:09.574
Thank you.

56:09.658 --> 56:12.368
I just feel like I need to say,
Bernie Tiede, God bless
you, son.

56:12.453 --> 56:15.329
You've done more to transform
the town of Carthage
than anyone else.

56:15.414 --> 56:21.294
- Oh, thank you.
- God bless you, Bernie.

56:21.378 --> 56:24.797
Bernie could've bought a
mansion for himself
with the money.

56:24.882 --> 56:27.467
But he kept
that little house

56:27.551 --> 56:29.802
worth, maybe, 50,000.

56:29.887 --> 56:33.473
Now he bought cars
for folks that needed it.

56:33.557 --> 56:36.142
And he paid cash for those.

56:36.226 --> 56:39.645
But that old Lincoln
he was drivin'?

56:39.730 --> 56:41.481
He had it financed.

56:41.565 --> 56:45.234
And he was
usually behind
on his payments.

56:45.319 --> 56:48.112
No, there really
wasn't any greed
in him.

56:48.197 --> 56:51.032
Almost everything he
got from Mrs. Nugent,

56:51.116 --> 56:53.826
he gave to somebody else.

57:03.629 --> 57:07.298
Lloyd seems to be
pretty concerned.

57:07.382 --> 57:09.300
He thinks the family
should get involved.

57:09.384 --> 57:12.386
Oh, good lord,
you gotta be
kidding me.

57:12.471 --> 57:15.181
I don't know why
Lloyd is so paranoid.

57:15.265 --> 57:17.100
It's like I told him.

57:17.184 --> 57:19.352
She's at the Scott White
Nursing Home in Temple.

57:19.436 --> 57:22.355
She didn't want
everyone to know,

57:22.439 --> 57:24.690
'cause she's afraid
the family would
come in

57:24.775 --> 57:26.275
and try to take
over her affairs.

57:26.360 --> 57:29.028
That sounds
just like Marjorie.

57:29.113 --> 57:31.447
Mm-hm. That's
Marjorie alright.

57:31.532 --> 57:33.783
- Mm-hm.
- One hundred percent.

57:33.867 --> 57:37.203
You know, Bernie,
she's my sister,

57:37.287 --> 57:39.580
and I guess that
I should love her.

57:39.665 --> 57:41.124
But she's just mean.

57:41.208 --> 57:43.668
She's just hard down mean.

57:43.752 --> 57:46.462
Mm. Well, there's some
goodness in there, too.

57:46.547 --> 57:48.506
She used to tear
up my toys,

57:48.590 --> 57:51.050
she pulled the heads
off my dolls,

57:51.135 --> 57:54.220

gardening, cooking
fancy food,

or artsy hobbies.

She's planning on doing
these things when she
gets old.

Thank you.

59:18.305 --> 59:21.098
So you saw Mrs. Nugent
in April of this year?

59:21.183 --> 59:23.142
You know, I believe
it was April.

59:23.227 --> 59:25.770
With your own eyes?

59:25.854 --> 59:29.357
Well, you know,
I didn't actually... see
her that day, I...

59:29.441 --> 59:32.985
I came to her house
to get her to sign
some documents.

59:33.070 --> 59:35.947
Bernie comes to the door,
says she's feeling poorly.

59:36.031 --> 59:38.991
Just then, he takes
the documents back
and she signs them.

59:39.076 --> 59:40.826
I go on
about my business.

59:40.911 --> 59:44.664
Okay. It
confirms a pattern.

59:44.748 --> 59:46.123
I appreciate it.

59:47.876 --> 59:50.002
Well, it sounds like
Lloyd Hornbuckle

59:50.087 --> 59:51.837
called Wayne Junior
up in Amarillo,

59:51.922 --> 59:53.464
and got him
all riled up.

59:53.548 --> 59:55.675
Oh, boy.

59:55.759 --> 59:57.593
You know, I think
Lloyd's just upset

59:57.678 --> 59:59.637
because he's
losing commissions
during her illness.

59:59.721 --> 01:00:01.681
He can't move
Mrs. Nugent's
money around

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:04.350
and keep taking
his commissions the
way he's used to, so...

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.686
It may be so, but
Dwayne Junior says
his money

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:10.273
comes in every year
for his kids from
his dad's will.

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.275
It hadn't come
in this year.

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:13.859
And it won't
until Mrs. Nugent's
in better condition

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.278

fine with me.

disturbing me,

know the truth.

the one responsible for it.

down the escalator at the
mall in Longview.

weeping by her
open casket.

her dead, Bernie?

and possessive of me.

around her any longer.

called her Home.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:26.518

and I must atone
for my sins. Oh!

home over in Timble.

just shocked. Just disbelief.

was somewhat of a sissy.

And it just ain't no way

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:21.240
I can see him
ever killing anybody.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:22.825
I thought they'd
made a mistake.

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:25.868
You got this sweet guy,
you got Bernie,

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:27.453
who's just the
nicest fella
I'd ever met,

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:28.913
and I've known him
for a little while,

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:30.749
and then you
got... Mrs. Nugent

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:33.252
who is not nice,

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:35.712
not nice to a
large degree, just evil.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:38.048
So you got this sweetness
and you got this evil,

01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:40.759
and they're kinda battlin'
each other, uh...

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:42.970
and you know that something
at some point's gotta give,

01:09:43.054 --> 01:09:44.971
something's gotta break

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:47.390
and she was justs
more evil than he
was nice, I guess,

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:49.017
and he just exploded.

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:52.604
We're all capable
of that dark moment.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:56.275
If we ever get
angry enough.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:58.610
He must've wanted
to get caught.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:00.529
All he had to do
was put her body

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:02.322
in one of his airplanes,

01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:04.992
fly her out over the Gulf
and push her right out.

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:08.078
No body,
no arrest.

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:10.289
A woman like that
with a bad heart...

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:13.125
he shoulda just shoved
the pillow right
over her face.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.627
Then they probably wouldn't
even done an autopsy.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:17.921
A few days later,
he'd be doing
her funeral.

01:10:18.006 --> 01:10:20.048
Oh, I just started
shaking my head

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:22.551
going, "Oh Bernie,
Bernie, Bernie, Bernie."

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:25.721
Who in their right mind
would kill their meal ticket?

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:27.639
It was crazy
around here.

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:31.476
People were on Danny Buck
like ticks on a coon dog.

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.478
Yeah, Danny Buck,
you know Bernie
didn't know

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:34.980
anything about
shooting a rifle.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.773
He didn't go huntin',

01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:38.734
he wouldn't
know a deer blind
from an outhouse.

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.611
That he wouldn't.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:42.237
There are not enough
nice men in this town.

01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:43.989
Leave poor
Bernie alone,
Danny Buck.

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:45.532
We don't even
think he did it.

01:10:45.617 --> 01:10:47.534
He confessed.

01:10:47.619 --> 01:10:49.369
Danny Buck,

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:51.955
you knew Mrs. Nugent
as well as any
of us did.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.332
Did you ever
stop to think

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:55.959
maybe, just maybe

01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:58.587
Bernie did it
in self defense.

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.130
Self defense.

01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:01.590
Maybe it was a
forced confession.

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:03.342
They could've
beat it out of him.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:05.010
He's too sweet to stand
up under interrogation.

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.845
Look, there was
no interrogation.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:10.057
He walked in,
sat down and
told us everything.

01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:12.017
Simple as that.

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.685
Well, hell.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.270
Even if he
did do it,

01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:16.688
she was so mean
and ornery,

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.440
she had it
coming to her.

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:20.734
It's not as bad as
people say it is.

01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:23.862
He only shot her
four times,
not five.

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:25.364
You know what?

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:27.324
You people are
as crazy as a coot.

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:29.910
I like Bernie Tiede
as much as you do.

01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:33.330
He did shoot
her though!

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:35.374
I tell you what.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.959
I don't claim
to know what
Bernie did

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:38.794
or did not do.

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:41.171
I figure that's
between him and
God Almighty.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.882
Mm-hm. And the
way I figure it,

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:46.760
that's where it
should stay.

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:50.889
Man, I hope
I'm on that jury.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:54.893
Yes, we need to be able
to forgive someone who's
done something wrong.

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:57.312
And no matter what
the truth is,

01:11:57.397 --> 01:12:01.566
Bernie is going
to need our prayers.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:04.027
So, folks, we
need to understand

01:12:04.112 --> 01:12:08.365
that tragedies
are simply tests
of our faith.

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:10.534
And right now,
Bernie needs to know,

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:15.163
especially during this
testing of his faith,

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:19.126
that God
and this congregation

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:22.879
have not
abandoned him.

01:12:22.964 --> 01:12:24.715
[Buck clears throat]

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:26.008
(pastor)
Good to see you,
thanks for coming.

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:27.426
Good to see you.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.052
God bless you
for everything.

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:31.054
Reverend. Now listen,

01:12:31.139 --> 01:12:35.267
I understand you
going all New Testament
on him but uh...

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.394
you got to at least
take him off the prayer list.

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:41.106
Hey, I gotta stay
neutral, everybody
needs a preacher.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.191
Neutral?

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:46.194
Reverend, basically
you were supporting
a criminal act.

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.530
You know, all I hear
is poor Bernie.

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.282
Nobody's talking
about poor Marjorie.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:52.576
Hell, everyone seems
to be forgetting

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:55.245
that there's a lady,
a member of this congregation,

01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:56.872
shot in the back
four times

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.457
and put in the freezer.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.208
Danny, the Bernie
you're talking about

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:02.544
is not the Bernie
this church knows.

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.671
The heck it isn't.

01:13:04.756 --> 01:13:06.840
It sounds like
the only Bernie you're
choosing to remember

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:09.926
is the one that
donated 100,000 dollars
to your church. Reverend.

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:12.304
Danny, look,
I'm sorry you
feel that...

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:15.474
It's been hard
on everyone.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.476
Alright, kiddos.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.144
All the good
that Bernie had done
for everybody,

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.855
or for us around here,
it just...

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:23.982
they come in,
and then it was
gonna get all

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:27.110
Mrs. Nugent's money
back that Bernie
had spent.

01:13:27.195 --> 01:13:29.112
We lost our airport,

01:13:29.197 --> 01:13:32.324
we lost our best store,

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:36.369
cars, some people
lost their houses,

01:13:36.454 --> 01:13:39.331
jet skis.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:42.501
He spent 600,000 dollars
of Mrs. Nugent's money.

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:53.845
No paperwork, anything?

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:56.014
A receipt [inaudible]?

01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:57.891
I don't know,
I mean...

01:13:57.975 --> 01:14:00.477
he just gave it to me,
said I could have it.

01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:06.233
Well, you know, at least
they could've left

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:07.526
some money for the church.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:11.029
Hell, [unintelligible].

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:12.614
(female voice)
Here they come!

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.991
[Cheering]

01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:17.661
(female reporter, off)
Although rumors have
been circulating

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:19.454
about a possible
plea bargain

01:14:19.539 --> 01:14:21.790
to lesser charges
or a probated sentence,

01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:23.959
District Attorney
Danny Buck Davidson

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:26.169
has shocked East Texas

01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:28.547
by filing first degree
murder charges
against Tiede,

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:31.049
which could result
in a life sentence.

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:33.093
[Shouting]

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:35.137
Clearly, the tiny
town of Carthage
is buzzing

01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:37.139
with opinions
over the murder.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:40.100
He didn't shoot
Mrs. Nugent in
the back.

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:41.560
He didn't do it.

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:45.105
Bernhardt Tiede
ain't no monster.

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:48.733
Ain't no jury
gonna convict Bernie
of first degree murder.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:50.694
In fact, I don't know

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:53.238
if a jury's gonna
convict him
of anything

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:55.490
and I'll say
this, if a jury
as to convict him,

01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:57.325
they'll probably gonna
give him probation.

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:59.202
They ain't
gonna send him
to the penitentiary.

01:14:59.287 --> 01:15:01.496
I n the meantime,
Bernie sits in
the county jail

01:15:01.581 --> 01:15:03.498
where he's reportedly
already become

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:05.167
a popular inmate

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:07.169
leading a Bible
study group

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:09.254
and cooking meals
for the staff.

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.173
(Bernie)
Now, we are going
to line the bottom

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:13.175
of the pie dish
with cheese

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:15.552
to provide a barrier
between the liquid
and the crust.

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:17.888
Now a lot of people
use grated cheese,

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:20.432
but I found that if
you cut it in little
quarter inch cubes,

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:23.351
it does a better
job of keeping the
crust from getting soggy.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:29.566
Now, we are going to
sauté the broccoli
lightly in olive oil

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:31.776
till it's just
bright green.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.570
That keeps
the flavor in.

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:35.572
If you put it in raw,
it's completely flavorless.

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:39.784
I'm not saying we want
the case totally dropped,

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:43.288
but isn't there some
way to keep Bernie from
getting punished too much?

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:45.916
That's $ 14.74.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.959
So let me ask you
something, Mrs. Beck.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:51.171
If someone came along
and shot you in the
back four times,

01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:55.217
would you still be fine
with me not letting them
get punished too much?

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:57.385
If I'm on that
jury, Danny Buck,

01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:59.971
I'm votin'
to acquit.

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:07.354
As far as convicting Bernie,

01:16:07.438 --> 01:16:10.649
I feed you straight.
I mean, even with the
confession in my pocket,

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.984
I was a bit trepidacious.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:16.821
I mean, it's like he
cast a spell over
the entire area.

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:19.241
All the little old ladies,

01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:21.326
Methodist church people,

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.453
anybody he'd ever
given anything to.

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:25.830
With Mrs. Nugent's money.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:28.416
All the closet homosexuals.
Everybody.

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:30.252
Everybody thought he
was gonna get off.

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:34.005
But I had one
card left to play.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.174
And I went all in.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:39.719
Trials are generally moved
when the judge determines

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:43.723
that the defendant can't get
a fair trial locally.

01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:49.980
And that's usually
because the crime is so
egregious and so well known

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:52.107
that everybody
in the community
has already convicted

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:55.360
the poor son
of a bitch accused of it.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:59.030
But in all
the years I've been
doing this for a living,

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:01.700
I have never heard
of the state

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.618
seeking a change
of venue

01:17:03.703 --> 01:17:06.204
because the defendant
was so well liked

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:08.665
that they couldn't
get a conviction.

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:14.045
So when I heard that
the judge had actually
agreed to move the trial,

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:19.092
giving in to Danny Buck's
harebrained request,

01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:22.762
my first thought
was, "Oh, shit.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:25.181
Our donkey's in a ditch."

01:17:25.266 --> 01:17:28.059
♪♪

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:29.686
Bring in the freezer.

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:34.858
Let the jury be able to see

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:40.905
where Mrs. Nugent spent
the first nine months
of her afterlife.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.241
A poor excuse for a casket.

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:46.244
Boys, make sure
it opens up
to the jury.

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:49.914
There's some wild shit
on both sides
of the courtroom.

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:52.584
But, you know,
this was the big stage

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:56.046
the big town,
the big show they'd
been waiting for

01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:57.797
and they pulled
out all the stops.

01:17:57.882 --> 01:18:01.593
They wheeled in
the actual deep freeze.

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:07.515
Mm-hm.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:13.021
They projected pictures
of frozen dead
Mrs. Nugent.

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:17.275
And then they started
bringing out the crying
weeping relatives.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.861
And then I went
to the freezer.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:21.446
And I saw

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:25.450
underneath her corn
and her steak and...

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:28.203
her pot pies was...

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:32.457
the top of her head.

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.000
It was so horrible.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.382
No further questions,
Your Honor.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:46.805
When was the last
time you talked
to your grandmother?

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:50.475
U m, I don't remember.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:52.185
Isn't it true that
you and your brother

01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:56.815
sued your grandmother
almost four years ago?

01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:59.275
We were advised
to by a lawyer.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.236
A lawyer?

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:06.074
You mean, just some
old boy come in off
the street?

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:09.202
Or are we talking
about your lawyer?

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:11.996
I guess he was
working for us.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:14.582
I'll say he was
working for you.

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:18.002
He was trying to get
your grandmother's
money, wasn't he?

01:19:21.799 --> 01:19:26.177
Did you ever speak
to her after that?

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:27.470
I don't think so.

01:19:27.555 --> 01:19:29.055
Oh, you don't
think so.

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.641
Well, you know
you didn't.

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:34.644
But you told us earlier
that you were real close
to your grandmother.

01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:37.981
Now was that the same
woman you were suing
for money?

01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:40.191
Is that the same woman

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:44.195
that you have
not spoken to
in four years?

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.782
I felt in our hearts
we were still close.

01:19:47.867 --> 01:19:50.368
[Scoffs]

01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:51.786
I knew he
was in trouble

01:19:51.871 --> 01:19:54.247
when I saw
that jury.

01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:57.834
And Bernie was just gonna
have to get up there and
explain himself

01:19:57.918 --> 01:20:02.422
to a bunch of Saint Augustine
cousin-countin' rednecks
over there.

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:05.592
I mean, they got more
tattoos than teeth

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:08.553
and there ain't
no brain in the
whole dozen of 'em,

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.722
and they're supposed
to decide

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:13.266
big things like this?

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:17.896
I mean, shoot,
I wouldn't let 'em
work on my car.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.398
Now, Bernie,

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:23.485
after you
were arrested you gave
a confession, correct?

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:26.571
Yes, sir.

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:30.366
How did you feel
about Marjorie Nugent?

01:20:30.451 --> 01:20:33.036
I cared for Marjorie deeply.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.371
I loved her very much.

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:37.207
And I've sent letters
from jail to her family

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:41.586
asking their forgiveness
for ruining Margy's life

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:44.923
and the pain
I've caused.

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:47.300
Well, if you
cared for her,

01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:50.094
even loved her,

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:53.097
why do you reckon
you killed her?

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.974
[Deep sigh]

01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:56.476
I could probably
describe it like
being in prison

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.562
to some degree.

01:20:59.647 --> 01:21:01.523
She wouldn't allow me
to have any friends,

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:04.734
and I'm a people
person. I got
to have my friends.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.528
[Sigh]

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:11.407
She was very jealous
and possessive of my time.

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:15.787
She had become
so hateful.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.623
I don't even remember
picking up the gun
that day.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:21.626
It was like
someone else
was doing it.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.128
So why did you
leave the body there?

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:26.130
It would seem
to me that

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:28.132
if you didn't
want to get caught,

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.426
you'd find some way
to dispose of it.

01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:31.803
Oh no, no, no.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.138
I could never do that.

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:35.932
That was never my intention.

01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:38.309
Everyone deserves
a proper burial.

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:40.687
And I was...

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.982
I was just waiting
for my chance
to give her one.

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:54.993
Thank you, Bernie.

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:58.371
I'll pass the witness.

01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:01.916
So help me
out here, Bernie.

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:07.505
On this trip
with Mrs. Nugent
to New York City,

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:12.468
did you fly
first class?

01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:15.013
Yes, I believe
we did.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:17.515
Tell us the difference
between like the first
class seats

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.684
and the regular old seats
in the back of the plane.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:22.687
I... I've never
been up there.

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.523
I'd say the seats
are a little larger maybe.

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.692
More comfortable.

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:30.236
Don't they have people
waiting' on you and stuff
too, you know?

01:22:30.321 --> 01:22:32.697
I mean, people
bringing you fancy food,

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:36.951
and serving you
whatever you want to
drink and stuff like that?

01:22:37.036 --> 01:22:40.288
Yes, the service
is probably a little better.

01:22:40.372 --> 01:22:42.665
Oh, so you like the
first class treatment.

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:48.421
First class lifestyle,
the best that money
can buy.

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:50.381
I was accompanying
Mrs. Nugent

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:52.425
who usually
preferred these things
when she traveled.

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:54.510
- Mm-hm.
- So.

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:57.889
Now, on that
New York City trip,

01:22:57.973 --> 01:22:59.724
it says here that
you and Mrs. Nugent

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:05.355
stayed at the...
the Ritz Carlton?

01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:09.067
That's a fancy hotel
near Central Park,
isn't it?

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:12.070
Yes, I believe that
is where we stayed.

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:14.989
It also says here
that while you were
in New York City,

01:23:15.074 --> 01:23:17.367
you saw an opera.

01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:19.285
And a Broadway play.

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:22.413
I think it's called
"Les Miserables."

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:27.752
[French accent]
Les Miserable.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:31.422
That's impressive.

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:32.965
What?

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:36.761
So culture
is important to you.

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.721
I n what way?

01:23:38.806 --> 01:23:41.557
Well, you seem to know
all these fancy words
and such.

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:43.768
Well, that one's
not very difficult.

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:48.106
[Laughter]

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:53.569
Not for you.

01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:57.740
You know all about
the high class life,
don't you?

01:23:57.825 --> 01:24:02.620
I... what... like what?

01:24:02.705 --> 01:24:05.998
Like, I don't know,
say for instance what...

01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:10.795
what kind of wine
are you supposed
to have with fish?

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:13.881
No, I don't...
white usually.

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:18.302
Mm-hm. That takes
a lot of money

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:20.471
to have so much
culture, don't it?

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:23.099
To... to enjoy the finer
things in life

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:25.184
that you love
so much.

01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:28.938
The ritzy hotels,
first class flying
off to the big cities.

01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:31.065
I mean, it takes
a lot of money

01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:32.650
to live that
way, don't it?

01:24:32.735 --> 01:24:34.652
No, I... left
to my own devices,

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:36.612
I would not
have been traveling
in such an expensive...

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:38.990
But left to someone
else's devices,
you were!

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:41.534
And after you killed
Mrs. Nugent,

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:43.453
you kept on spending
her money, didn't you?

01:24:43.537 --> 01:24:45.455
A lot of it!

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:47.415
And if you wouldn't
a been caught,

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:50.001
you'd still be
spending her
money today.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:51.461
Wouldn't you?

01:24:51.545 --> 01:24:54.714
Wouldn't you?

01:24:54.798 --> 01:24:58.176
[Thud with hand]

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:00.720
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:25:00.804 --> 01:25:03.681
after listening to
all the evidence,

01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:06.058
I'm sure that
you will agree

01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:10.980
that the defendant
is a liar, a coward

01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:15.026
and a backshooter.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:17.695
Now, come on.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.572
That's got to be
about the lowest thing

01:25:19.656 --> 01:25:23.576
a man could ever do,
ain't it?

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:26.871
Shoot a little old
lady in the back?

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:30.458
Four times.

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:33.085
There is no doubt
in my mind

01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:38.090
Bernie Tiede is
a calculating
evil actor.

01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:40.635
He fooled a whole town

01:25:40.719 --> 01:25:43.262
for nine months.

01:25:43.347 --> 01:25:45.264
Now if he can do that,

01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:46.849
there ain't no telling
what he'll do

01:25:46.934 --> 01:25:49.060
if you let him
back on the streets.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:59.570
That poor woman stayed
frozen stiff for nine
whole months.

01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:03.282
I n a freezer.

01:26:03.367 --> 01:26:07.578
It took two days
to thaw her out.

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:11.666
Just so they could
perform a proper autopsy.

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:17.088
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.714
I'm sorry.

01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:28.057
Your honor, counsel,
ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:31.060
all Danny Buck Davidson
wants to do in this trial

01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:34.897
is get you to believe
that Bernie is some
kind of monster.

01:26:34.982 --> 01:26:39.902
That he is
something other than
a fellow human being.

01:26:39.987 --> 01:26:41.821
Look at him,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:26:41.905 --> 01:26:45.992
There is not one hint
of premeditation
in this case.

01:26:46.076 --> 01:26:49.120
If there was, he'd have
done it a lot differently.

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:51.330
He mighta
gotten away with it.

01:26:51.415 --> 01:26:55.459
Did he try to poison
her slowly? No.

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:57.628
Did he burn
down the house?

01:26:57.713 --> 01:27:01.257
Say it was an
accidental fire? No.

01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:02.842
He still knew
he done wrong.

01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:04.385
He knew he was gonna
get found out.

01:27:04.469 --> 01:27:06.178
He just didn't have
the courage

01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:08.139
to tell on himself.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:10.266
But like a good
funeral director,

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:15.438
he preserved the body
so that she could have
a proper burial.

01:27:15.522 --> 01:27:21.736
And in the meantime
he did a lot of good
for a lot of people.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:26.908
Till he finally
got caught.

01:27:26.992 --> 01:27:31.329
He just doesn't sound
like any kind of monster
I've ever heard of.

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:33.623
Thank you.

01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:35.082
[Lively chatter]

01:27:44.134 --> 01:27:47.011
(Danny)
That doesn't excuse
the crime that was committed.

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:50.097
Now look, everybody's
describing Bernie Tiede
as such a great guy.

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:52.850
"Oh, he's
so wonderful.
He's an angel."

01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:54.685
Let me tell you,
he's an angel alright.

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:58.356
An angel of death.

01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.899
Thank you.

01:28:31.682 --> 01:28:39.146
(male voice)
Bernie Tiede,
please rise.

01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:42.024
Mr. Foreman, it
is my understanding

01:28:42.109 --> 01:28:44.443
that the jury
has reached a verdict.

01:28:44.528 --> 01:28:47.238
Yes, sir,
we have,
Your Honor.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.365
Is it unanimous?

01:28:49.449 --> 01:28:50.866
Yes, sir.

01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:57.123
Would you please
read the verdict?

01:28:57.207 --> 01:29:00.584
[Clears throat]

01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:02.253
We, the jury,

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:04.880
find the defendant
Bernie Tiede,

01:29:04.965 --> 01:29:07.425
guilty of murder
as charged.

01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:08.592
[Gasping]

01:29:41.418 --> 01:29:43.461
(Bernie)
They gave me life.

01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:49.216
I won't even be
up for parole
for 50 years.

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:51.010
I'll be 89 years old.

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:55.639
Danny Buck,
you gotta hand
it to him.

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:59.393
What he did,
is two groups, you know.

01:29:59.478 --> 01:30:01.979
It was
the high-falutin'
first class livin'

01:30:02.064 --> 01:30:04.148
Bernies of the world,

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.275
and then there was
the, you know,

01:30:06.359 --> 01:30:10.571
let's dig a hole in
the backyard and cook
something, you know?

01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:15.159
Put another tire
on the fire, George.
I'm cold.

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:17.203
It was just
two different worlds
he created there

01:30:17.287 --> 01:30:21.791
and Bernie wasn't
of their world.

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:27.838
[Soft murmuring]

01:30:27.923 --> 01:30:29.673
(Bernie)
It's not as bad
as you think.

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:34.512
I'm the choir director,
teaching four classes.

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:37.223
I'm in the craft shop
most of the day.

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:38.516
I miss my freedom.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.810
Well, sure
you do, hon.

01:30:40.894 --> 01:30:42.520
I'm making
the best of it.

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:44.188
Got a lot
to live for.

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:46.398
You do.
You do.

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:47.817
I wanna help
people here.

01:30:47.901 --> 01:30:49.860
[Shouting]

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:52.446
Hm, well, I have
to tell you what
I've done.

01:30:52.531 --> 01:30:54.448
I wrote the warden
a letter.

01:30:54.533 --> 01:30:56.325
Yeah, I did.

01:30:56.409 --> 01:30:58.452
I told him that he
had to give you
a work release

01:30:58.537 --> 01:31:00.412
or something like that

01:31:00.497 --> 01:31:02.790
so that you could
sing at my funeral.

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:05.376
Now, I'm not sick
or anything, but
now Bernie,

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.295
you promised me
that you would
do that.

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:11.215
And I totally mean
wear those chains
or whatever

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:13.717
if it made them
feel better so...

01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:16.137
That is awful
sweet, Lenora.

01:31:16.221 --> 01:31:19.014
And it would be
an honor but don't
count on it.

01:31:19.099 --> 01:31:20.307
I don't think they're
letting me out of here
for nothing.

01:31:20.392 --> 01:31:22.518
Oh!
[Pfft]

01:31:22.602 --> 01:31:25.062
Sure they will.
I told him that you
went temporarily insane.

01:31:25.147 --> 01:31:27.815
And we're all going
insane sooner or later.

01:31:27.899 --> 01:31:30.401
I mean, that's the way
I look at it.

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:34.905
U h-oh. He's telling
me our time is up.

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:36.782
I cannot tell you
how much it means
to me

01:31:36.867 --> 01:31:38.909
that I'm still
in your prayers.

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:40.494
And that I'll
always be with you.

01:31:40.579 --> 01:31:43.414
Yes. And you know
how much we love you.

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:45.583
And I will tell you,
I look around here.

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:47.084
You need to take
care of yourself

01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:48.752
and be real careful
because I think

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:50.588
this could be
a dangerous place.

01:31:50.672 --> 01:31:52.631
- You think?
- I do.

01:31:52.716 --> 01:31:54.592
And we'll come back
in a couple of weeks.

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:55.759
Take care.
I love you.

01:31:55.844 --> 01:31:59.180
I love you, baby.

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:00.681
You take
care of him.

01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:12.026
I don't care
what he did.

01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:14.612
Yes, I do care.

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:18.032
It was wrong.

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:23.913
But I believed that if Bernie
were truly sorry for what
he did,

01:32:23.997 --> 01:32:26.624
and would ask
God's forgiveness,

01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:31.045
God would forgive him.

01:32:31.129 --> 01:32:37.676
And after all,
that's all that
really matters.

01:32:37.761 --> 01:32:40.554
I will miss him.

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:42.223
All of us will.

01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:44.934
[Slow sad violin music]

01:33:13.296 --> 01:33:15.756
[Violin music continues]

01:34:08.601 --> 01:34:10.477
[Fast music]

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:55.416
I'll never believe

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.084
till the day
God calls me home

01:35:57.168 --> 01:35:59.503
that Bernie
Tiede killed
Mrs. Nugent.

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:01.463
And... and that's
just the way I feel.

01:36:01.548 --> 01:36:03.674
And my husband told
me, "Daisy, when you
go up there,

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:05.968
"you don't change your
mind if you see some
of those people

01:36:06.052 --> 01:36:08.345
"standing out there
in the courthouse
that you love,

01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:10.347
"that's your friends too."

01:36:10.432 --> 01:36:14.518
I said, "Hey, I don't
think Jesus could
change my mind."

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:17.104
That's just
the way I feel
from day one.

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:19.022
And I will always
feel that way.

01:36:19.107 --> 01:36:20.607
Bernie was
a good man.

01:36:20.692 --> 01:36:22.234
Bernie had
a great heart.

01:36:22.318 --> 01:36:24.653
We need
more Bernies
in this world.

01:36:24.737 --> 01:36:27.531
Murderers come along
once in a blue moon
over here

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:30.534
and typically,
they're family related,

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:32.578
I mean, it's
just how it
works out,

01:36:32.662 --> 01:36:34.496
we don't have
strange killings,

01:36:34.581 --> 01:36:36.331
it's just some family member
got upset with the other

01:36:36.416 --> 01:36:37.666
and shot him,
killed him dead,

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:39.042
and they know
they gonna go

01:36:39.127 --> 01:36:40.711
to penitentiary
for a while.

01:36:40.795 --> 01:36:43.172
Now we even have
less murder trials

01:36:43.256 --> 01:36:44.965
'cause most of 'em
plead out.

01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:47.384
So this thing
becomes a media circus,

01:36:47.469 --> 01:36:50.262
we got people coming in
from all across the
U nited States.

01:36:50.346 --> 01:36:53.724
Old Danny Buck,
we caught him
with a stiff neck,

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.809
he... he got kind
of stiff neck,

01:36:55.894 --> 01:36:57.603
kinda get your neck
a little stiff,

01:36:57.687 --> 01:36:59.146
he got a stiff neck,
he was like a pig
in shit

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:01.064
when all this
was going up.

01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:04.401
Talking about what
wine to drink with fish,

01:37:04.486 --> 01:37:08.197
I mean, those people
drink warm beer
with fried mudcat

01:37:08.281 --> 01:37:10.782
and he's
trying to say...

01:37:10.867 --> 01:37:14.661
I took one look
at the jury and
I said, U h-oh.

01:37:14.746 --> 01:37:16.663
[Chuckles]

01:37:16.748 --> 01:37:18.790
Scrappy, you ain't
gonna do it, buddy.

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.542
I mean, you
ain't gonna do it.

01:37:20.627 --> 01:37:22.544
You don't have
enough equipment
to bring

01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:25.422
these people outta
their dang hovels
over there.

01:37:25.507 --> 01:37:28.175
Jesus, he's my daddy,
he's my cousin.

01:37:28.259 --> 01:37:30.594
It's like, some
of them people

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:32.554
shouldn't be allowed
out of the county

01:37:32.639 --> 01:37:34.932
and we took the whole
damn trial over there,
you know?

01:37:35.016 --> 01:37:37.100
What are they asking for?
I don't get it.

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:39.228
