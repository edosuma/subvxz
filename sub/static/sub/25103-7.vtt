00:01.210 --> 00:02.780
Previously on Queen Sugar...

00:02.830 --> 00:04.377
I spent some time
in prison.

00:04.420 --> 00:06.627
I understand if it makes
you feel some type of way.

00:06.670 --> 00:09.377
Why would I be here
ifI did?

00:09.420 --> 00:12.423
Baby, I just want you
to be open to love.

00:12.470 --> 00:14.131
Just gotta give yourself
permission.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.841
What are you surveying
the land for?

00:15.890 --> 00:17.551
I can't disclose
that information, ma'am.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.306
I'm telling you,
there's something going on.

00:19.350 --> 00:21.306
I want to invest in you,

00:21.350 --> 00:23.181
help you become bigger
than you've ever dreamed.

00:23.230 --> 00:25.391
[Darla] You are letting
that random guy stay here.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.896
Why don't you start
by doing right by your son?

00:26.940 --> 00:28.259
You know it all, huh?!

00:28.320 --> 00:29.639
Don't talk to my mommy
like that!

00:29.690 --> 00:31.180
I want to stay
with Mommy!

00:31.240 --> 00:35.984
[upbeat song playing
in background]

00:36.030 --> 00:37.577
Look what we got chere.

00:38.870 --> 00:41.077
Ooh, those
are beautiful.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.453
"A beautiful bounty
of sunshine

00:44.500 --> 00:45.740
for the birthday girl.

00:45.790 --> 00:48.202
Happy 60th.
Love Marqueena."

00:48.250 --> 00:50.332
She coming to the lunch?

00:50.380 --> 00:54.419
That boss of hers
at Chevron

00:54.470 --> 00:56.461
act like the building's
gonna fall apart

00:56.510 --> 00:58.466
if she took a day off.

00:58.510 --> 01:01.263
You sure you don't want me
to spring for something fancier?

01:01.310 --> 01:04.689
Celebrating
at Mama's Italian Ristorante

01:04.730 --> 01:06.266
got me to 60.

01:06.310 --> 01:08.517
Don't fix
what ain't broke.

01:09.610 --> 01:10.679
What's this?

01:10.730 --> 01:12.812
Oh. Oh, that...

01:14.650 --> 01:18.404
is my pie contract
from Jarrett.

01:18.450 --> 01:20.611
He wants 60%
of the company.

01:20.660 --> 01:22.321
I just get 40.

01:22.370 --> 01:23.780
Well, he got
the start-up money, the stores,

01:23.830 --> 01:25.149
and everything else, right?

01:25.210 --> 01:26.780
But they my pies.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.741
That makes it seem
like I'm working for him.

01:28.790 --> 01:30.166
Yeah, that's one way
of looking at it.

01:30.210 --> 01:32.542
What's the other way
to look at it?

01:36.050 --> 01:38.427
I'm gonna pitch
to Rawlings

01:40.220 --> 01:42.677
my own pie shop.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.340
I do not want to spend
the rest of my life

01:46.390 --> 01:49.223
in somebody's kitchen,
pumpin' out pies

01:49.270 --> 01:51.318
like a well-paid mammy.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.725
Okay, Sojourner Truth.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.317
Look here, I got this for you.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.576
Baby, the box is empty.

02:09.630 --> 02:13.168
Because you're a woman
who knows what she wants.

02:13.210 --> 02:14.666
And whatever you want
for your birthday,

02:14.710 --> 02:16.871
I'm gonna fill
that box up with it.

02:16.920 --> 02:22.597
Because nothing
is too good for
Miss Violet Bordelon...

02:22.640 --> 02:23.800
Desnonier.

02:23.850 --> 02:26.808
Violet Desonier.

02:26.850 --> 02:29.432
That sound good, don't it?

02:29.480 --> 02:31.050
Mm-hmm.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.697
Dreams never die

02:39.740 --> 02:42.152
Take flight
As the world turns

02:42.200 --> 02:44.077
Dreams never die

02:44.120 --> 02:45.906
Take flight
As the world turns

02:45.950 --> 02:47.440
Keep the colors
In the lines

02:47.500 --> 02:48.535
Take flight

02:50.040 --> 02:51.120
Dreams never die

02:57.340 --> 02:59.877
Keep the colors
In the lines

03:01.970 --> 03:04.256
Keep the colors
In the lines, take flight

03:56.610 --> 03:58.851
You're a hard woman
to find.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.772
I stopped by your office
to talk shop.

04:05.820 --> 04:08.288
Your new girl told me
to try you here.

04:10.830 --> 04:13.572
You came all this way
to discuss business?

04:15.040 --> 04:16.029
I wanted to see you.

04:17.460 --> 04:19.587
About the other night,

04:19.630 --> 04:21.291
I ain't gonna lie.

04:21.340 --> 04:23.001
I had
a real good time.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.790
Yeah, me, too.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.465
I'm sorry
if I scared you off.

04:28.510 --> 04:29.716
I don't blame you
for not returning my calls.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.805
I wasn't scared.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.268
I was tending
to some family matters.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.221
I heard.

04:39.270 --> 04:40.851
I'm real sorry.

04:44.990 --> 04:46.867
Let me take you out.

04:46.910 --> 04:48.025
Proper.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.071
We'll go somewhere fun

04:50.120 --> 04:51.360
where we don't have
to worry about
who's looking.

04:56.420 --> 04:57.455
I like you.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.377
But?

05:00.500 --> 05:02.252
I need some time...

05:03.420 --> 05:04.500
alone

05:04.550 --> 05:06.962
to sort things out.

05:07.010 --> 05:09.387
It's best_we stick
to busmess...

05:09.430 --> 05:11.466
for now.

05:13.390 --> 05:16.848
Well, I'll let you get
back to your breakfast.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.300
Look forward
to seeing you again soon.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.976
Business or otherwise.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.692
Good day to you,
Miss Bordelon.

05:42.090 --> 05:44.411
What's the deal?

05:44.470 --> 05:45.835
I messed up.

05:47.590 --> 05:49.717
Dishonoring
your home like that.

05:51.390 --> 05:52.926
I was just chillin'
with a friend.

05:52.970 --> 05:56.758
I had no idea he was
bringing his friends.

05:56.810 --> 06:00.519
I didn't mean no disrespect
to you, your house,

06:00.560 --> 06:01.891
your little boy.

06:01.940 --> 06:04.272
And I was wondering

06:06.400 --> 06:08.732
ifI can still
keep my job.

06:11.030 --> 06:13.783
I don't play
when it come to my son.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.166
That being said,

06:20.630 --> 06:22.916
somebody gave me
a second chance.

06:26.090 --> 06:27.876
I'm gonna do
the same for you.

06:29.380 --> 06:31.041
Thank you.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.466
Head out to the farm.

06:33.510 --> 06:36.229
Tool shed could use
some keepIn'.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.886
-[cell phone vibrating]
-I'm on it.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.300
Grab this.

06:44.730 --> 06:45.719
Darla.

06:47.530 --> 06:49.441
How are you?

06:49.490 --> 06:50.650
[Ralph Angel]
I'm a'ight.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.520
Blue good.

06:52.570 --> 06:54.982
Ain't _talkin'
about leaVIn' no more.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.957
Glad about that.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.571
Kids say things
they don't always mean.

07:02.710 --> 07:04.086
Adults do, too.

07:09.170 --> 07:10.922
What time should
I come by tomorrow?

07:10.970 --> 07:12.961
What for?

07:13.010 --> 07:15.638
For Blue staying over
at my place this weekend.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.592
I got his room all ready.

07:18.640 --> 07:21.973
And I got tickets
to an art exhibit
at the children's museum

07:22.020 --> 07:23.851
he was really excited about.

07:23.900 --> 07:26.141
It's Vi's birthday
tomorrow.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.099
I see.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.861
You never said anything.

07:34.910 --> 07:38.198
That's my bad. Um,

07:38.250 --> 07:40.320
came up last minute.

07:40.370 --> 07:43.419
But she's gonna be
expecting to see Blue.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.280
I'm sorry.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.331
I'll, uh...

07:47.380 --> 07:48.586
pick him up
the morning after

07:48.630 --> 07:50.962
for breakfast or something.

07:52.340 --> 07:53.716
I'll talk to you later.

07:53.760 --> 07:54.966
Bye.

08:01.270 --> 08:03.340
Did you think
as a young man

08:03.400 --> 08:05.891
farming was what
you wanted to spend
your life doing?

08:05.940 --> 08:07.646
[scoffs]
As a young man, no.

08:07.690 --> 08:09.430
[chuckles]

08:09.480 --> 08:12.529
Nah, too restless
like most of us back then.

08:12.570 --> 08:14.777
Yeah,
joined the military,

08:14.820 --> 08:17.823
wanted to see the world
and play my mu5|c.

08:17.870 --> 08:21.249
Yeah, but whenever
tough times hit,

08:21.290 --> 08:24.453
found myself
thinking of home.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.663
working
on God's good earth.

08:27.710 --> 08:30.338
Figured I wanted
to pull something good
up out of the ground,

08:30.380 --> 08:32.507
instead of helping
Uncle Sam put
dead bodies in it.

08:32.550 --> 08:35.587
Yeah, when I got
out of the military,

08:35.640 --> 08:40.213
I took what
I made, and I leased
as much acres as I could.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.262
It was a proud day
for me and my family.

08:46.190 --> 08:49.262
Did you ever try
to buy the farmland
from the Landrys?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.231
Tried a few times.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.602
After I got married
and when my daughter
was born, but...

08:54.660 --> 08:56.400
[chuckles]

08:56.450 --> 08:58.827
white folks ain't
givin' up no land.

09:00.700 --> 09:04.363
No, I never owned,
but did whatever I could

09:04.410 --> 09:07.163
_to make sure
my little girl had better.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.793
Would you say
it was harder to own
than to lease?

09:11.840 --> 09:15.298
I mean, I know my daddy
with property taxes and all.

09:15.340 --> 09:17.672
Wasn't until after he died,

09:17.720 --> 09:20.507
I saw how hard
owning really was.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.710
'Cause he was
under Landry's foot.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.341
The only place he could
mill his cane was with Sam.

09:25.390 --> 09:28.939
Then you have a couple
of years of bad crop,

09:28.980 --> 09:30.891
and, psh, that land, man,

09:30.940 --> 09:32.851
it'll break a man in two.

09:32.900 --> 09:35.642
That's what brought
you two together.

09:37.700 --> 09:41.989
I think we were friends
'cause he could trust me.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.741
He, um...

09:48.630 --> 09:51.838
Your daddy went through, uh,

09:51.880 --> 09:54.713
a bad patch after Tru died.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.422
Called me in the middle
of the night one night

09:57.470 --> 09:59.756
and wanted to talk,
so he came out,

09:59.800 --> 10:03.099
and we walked these fields
for hours.

10:03.140 --> 10:05.301
What were you
talking about?

10:05.350 --> 10:08.183
Oh, his land, and...

10:08.230 --> 10:11.142
he was having a hard time
holding on to it.

10:11.190 --> 10:13.647
Talked about struggling
with money

10:13.690 --> 10:16.818
and supporting you kids
and losing Tru.

10:16.860 --> 10:19.567
I mean, it was too much.

10:19.610 --> 10:20.611
He, uh...

10:22.830 --> 10:26.197
He was starting to wonder
if it was all worth it.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.162
You mean the land?

10:30.750 --> 10:32.286
Everything.

10:33.590 --> 10:34.830
I'm sorry? I--

10:35.920 --> 10:37.330
I don't understand.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.130
Your father
was wandering the fields

10:41.180 --> 10:42.716
with a gun that night.

10:46.350 --> 10:47.510
But...

10:49.810 --> 10:53.268
Daddy was... strong.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.469
He...

10:54.520 --> 10:56.021
None of us are so strong

10:56.070 --> 10:58.061
we can't find ourselves
In dark places.

11:02.820 --> 11:06.278
Just so many things
you don't say.

11:06.330 --> 11:11.950
Stuff only God
and the land knows.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.742
But I'm grateful
Ernest called me that night.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.292
He was brave to show me
he was hurting.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.849
Baby, where you been?
It's lunchtime.

11:26.890 --> 11:28.926
We have to be
at the restaurant.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.800
Look who showed up.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.772
Well, bless your heart,
Willa Mae.

11:36.820 --> 11:39.106
Well, I wasn't gonna
let no little bus ride

11:39.150 --> 11:41.232
keep me from coming
to celebrate

11:41.280 --> 11:43.942
my future
daughter-in-law's birthday.

11:43.990 --> 11:45.617
So, surprise.

11:45.660 --> 11:47.901
[laughing]

11:47.950 --> 11:50.828
I surprised Hollywood.

11:50.870 --> 11:52.576
Sure did.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.247
-[laughing]
-[Violet] Well...

11:54.290 --> 11:57.544
uh, after all that riding,
you must be thirsty.

11:57.590 --> 11:59.046
Can I get you some water?

11:59.090 --> 12:01.376
Oh, that'd be nice.
Thank you, Violet.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.637
Right back.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.420
Okay, now, Momma,
be good.

12:05.470 --> 12:07.097
You just shush.

12:07.140 --> 12:09.051
I just come down here
to help y'all celebrate.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.055
You all right with that?

12:10.100 --> 12:11.931
Yes, ma'am.

12:11.980 --> 12:16.895
Besides, it's not every day
a woman reaches 60.

12:16.940 --> 12:18.851
Past is the past.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.642
And here we go.

12:21.700 --> 12:25.238
All right.
And, Hollywood, baby? Um...

12:25.280 --> 12:26.907
Where's your momma staying?

12:26.950 --> 12:29.282
I ain't gonna put my momma
in no motel.

12:29.330 --> 12:30.365
[Willa Mae] Violet?

12:32.290 --> 12:34.451
This is for you.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.831
[laughs] Well...

12:45.590 --> 12:47.797
Holleood.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.169
Whoa.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.056
[Willa Mae] I heard
them pies of yours

12:53.100 --> 12:55.842
just been blowin' up
in the grocery store,

12:55.900 --> 12:58.050
and I'm proud of you.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.772
Well, thank you.
It's beautiful.

13:00.820 --> 13:03.527
Come on. Let's, um,
put your stuff
in the guest room.

13:03.570 --> 13:05.197
Well, now, are you sure?

13:05.240 --> 13:06.355
I don't want to put

13:06.410 --> 13:08.651
Absolutely, I insist.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.442
Holleood, get
my bags off the porch.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.707

13:31.220 --> 13:33.302

13:51.370 --> 13:53.691
We couldn't let you

13:53.750 --> 13:55.741
And we got some more folks

It's a pleasure to meet you.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.697
And where are your manners?
Here, take this.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.526
You didn't offer this girl
a drink?

15:54.570 --> 15:55.946
-Hmm.
-My bad.

15:55.990 --> 15:57.070
Come on. We're

Everybody's sitting around.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.741
It's time to hit
that dance floor, baby.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.756
I want to find out
about these work friends.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.948
[Hollywood]
Come on. Stand back

That I can do

Follow them.

16:51.630 --> 16:54.258
[song playing in distance]

16:59.810 --> 17:01.971
You all right
all the way out here?

17:05.730 --> 17:07.971
Just some stuff about Daddy.

17:09.770 --> 17:11.738
I'm not feeling
very festive.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.190
Want to talk about it?

17:24.040 --> 17:26.747

-Mm.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.381
You seen my moves?

17:38.430 --> 17:40.000
_ I don't know
If I've seen your moves.

17:40.050 --> 17:43.383

than a U-Haul.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.636
Come over here.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.982
I think I'll just stay here,

17:58.030 --> 18:00.237
if that's all right.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.531
All right.

18:24.430 --> 18:25.419
Hey.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.050
Blue?

18:29.100 --> 18:30.761
This is Miss Trinh.

18:30.810 --> 18:31.469
Friend from work.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.566
[whispers] She's nice.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.316
-Hello.
-Hello, Blue.

18:40.370 --> 18:44.238
I, uh... I like
your shark socks.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.746
Those are super cool.

18:45.790 --> 18:47.405
Thanks.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.859

-[Ralph Angel] In here.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.746
Uh, baby,
we just ran out of ice.

18:52.790 --> 18:54.166
Would you mind running
to the store and fetching some?

18:54.210 --> 18:55.586
I gotcha.

18:55.630 --> 18:57.507
-Thank you.
-Yep.

18:57.550 --> 19:00.178
All right, come on, Blue.

19:00.220 --> 19:01.630
Wanna roll with?

19:01.680 --> 19:03.921
No, I don't have to go.

19:07.930 --> 19:09.181
Ain't no big deal.

19:09.230 --> 19:11.346
Be our little secret mission.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.607
Come on.

19:13.650 --> 19:14.935
-Yeah?
-Come on.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.390
Little adventure.

19:22.660 --> 19:23.775
[Hollywood]
There you go, Mom.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.780
That's a double, ain't it?

19:26.830 --> 19:28.070
Yeah. Thank you, Momma.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.656
[laughing]

19:29.710 --> 19:30.950
What you thankin' me for?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.410
Ahh.

19:32.460 --> 19:34.371
Well, for being
nice to Vi.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.376
I know y'all don't
always see eye to eye.

19:36.420 --> 19:38.126
Oh, son, I told you,

19:38.170 --> 19:40.377
I'm not here to start
no trouble.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.752
But let me ask you this.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.882
Where you fit in
to all of this?

19:49.350 --> 19:53.138
You know, me and Vi,
we want the same things.

19:53.190 --> 19:54.930
Love, happiness,

19:54.980 --> 19:56.766
to have fun.

19:58.570 --> 20:00.276
Yeah, she's my soul mate.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.697
I can't help
the package it comes in

20:02.740 --> 20:04.560
_ or what date_
IS stamped on It.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.861
It just is what it is.

20:10.330 --> 20:13.572
No disrespect,
but I don't remember seeing

20:13.630 --> 20:16.121
a whole lot of good times
between you and Daddy.

20:16.170 --> 20:18.377
Momma, the difference
between me and that man

20:18.420 --> 20:20.877
is that even
when he came off the rig,

20:20.920 --> 20:22.831
the man never came
off the rIg.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.461
Your daddy...

20:26.600 --> 20:27.965
worked hard,

20:28.010 --> 20:30.979
dealing with all that he did.

20:31.020 --> 20:32.635
He was a good provider,

20:32.690 --> 20:36.433
and he gave us what he could.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.563
Momma, I'm not gonna apologize
for loving the way that I love.

20:39.610 --> 20:42.397
For trying to treat
a woman the way I think
she should be treated.

20:42.450 --> 20:45.567
I am so proud

20:46.820 --> 20:48.731
of the man you are.

20:48.790 --> 20:54.069
But sometimes, you--
you get so wrapped up
in all of it,

20:54.120 --> 20:55.997
you lose sight of you.

20:56.040 --> 20:59.999
I told you long ago
Leanne wasn't right,

21:00.050 --> 21:02.587
but you found out
the hard way.

21:02.630 --> 21:04.291
Momma, what are you
talkin' about? This ain't--

21:04.340 --> 21:07.138
Vi.
She got her own house,

21:07.180 --> 21:09.136
her own money.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.512
She don't need a man,
'cept to tell him what to do.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.925
Oh, that ain't
what this is.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.301
Well, what about you?

21:15.350 --> 21:19.229
What about all the things
you always wanted to do?

21:19.270 --> 21:22.524
And I'm gonna say it.

21:22.570 --> 21:23.855
Kids.

21:25.610 --> 21:27.987
Yeah, well,
we talked about it.

21:28.030 --> 21:30.112
I'm okay with it.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.696
Listen to me.

21:35.830 --> 21:37.661
I put away

21:37.710 --> 21:39.746
a lot of my dreams

21:39.790 --> 21:42.543
to have a family
and a home.

21:42.590 --> 21:47.175
And I didn't have
the luxury of nothing else.

21:47.220 --> 21:51.099
You can do anything
you want,

21:51.140 --> 21:54.348
but you're so busy
taking care of her...

21:57.100 --> 21:58.761
when you gonna
take care of you?

22:04.280 --> 22:06.316
[Trinh] So, uh, what are
these dance moves

22:06.360 --> 22:08.021
you promised me, huh?

22:08.070 --> 22:10.368
Okay, I'll show
you this one kind.

22:10.410 --> 22:12.230
-Super duper times four.
-Super duper times four?

22:12.290 --> 22:13.826
So you do this
four times.

22:13.870 --> 22:15.451
[Trinh]
Four times? Like that?

22:15.500 --> 22:16.649
[Ralph Angel]
Get in the car, Blue.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.200
[Trinh]
What's that?

22:18.250 --> 22:19.820
Is that the "duper" part?

22:19.880 --> 22:22.542
[Blue] No.
That's the "duper" part.

22:22.590 --> 22:25.161
I got it.
You do this four times.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.335
[Trinh] You're
a really good dancer.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.007
-Yea h?
-Yeah.

22:30.050 --> 22:32.382
Do you have other moves
you can show me later?

22:32.430 --> 22:33.886
Maybe in an hour?

22:33.930 --> 22:35.306
Will it not be
a secret anymore?

22:35.350 --> 22:37.181
-[laughs]
-[B|ue] Forever it will.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.687
[engine starts]

22:43.270 --> 22:45.431
[Tidus] It's a different day
Man what could I say

22:45.490 --> 22:47.276
And I've been patient

22:47.320 --> 22:50.027
Yeah but anyway
When they in the way

22:50.070 --> 22:52.368
Can't stop my greatness

22:52.410 --> 22:54.287
Yeah we're on the way
What you gonna say

22:54.330 --> 22:56.241
No limitations

22:56.290 --> 22:58.861
Watch me get away
Watch me get away

22:58.920 --> 23:00.490
Up on my spaceship

23:00.540 --> 23:02.121
What's going on in here?

23:03.960 --> 23:05.416
And why is the door
all closed?

23:05.460 --> 23:07.667
We were just talking.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.837
Well, you get on
back out to the party.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.255
[both chuckle]

23:13.300 --> 23:14.961
[cell phone chimes]

23:18.600 --> 23:20.511
It's Ant.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.267
What are they up to?

23:23.310 --> 23:24.766
I guess him and the crew

23:24.820 --> 23:26.560
are hanging out
at the levee later.

23:28.570 --> 23:30.026
You wanna go?

23:32.280 --> 23:35.659
No. I kind of feel
like we should stay
for the whole party.

23:37.870 --> 23:40.202
Yes. Yeah, you're right.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.030
You spending a lot
of time with them.

23:48.050 --> 23:49.915
Yeah, I think they're cool.

23:51.840 --> 23:56.379
And I think that you
should spend more time with us.

23:56.430 --> 23:58.057
I thought y'all was friends.

24:00.100 --> 24:02.898
Back in the day,
we were.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.306
But we're different
now, you know?

24:05.360 --> 24:06.975
They have their own way
of doing things,

24:07.020 --> 24:09.272
and I have mine.

24:09.320 --> 24:13.484
But you can still
hang out with them, though.

24:13.530 --> 24:15.236
[Violet]
Are y'all still in here?

24:15.280 --> 24:17.020
Sorry.

24:21.540 --> 24:23.667
-Keke?
-Ma'am?

24:23.710 --> 24:24.825
That way.

24:28.670 --> 24:33.084
["Poor Person"
by Denai Moore playing]

24:46.480 --> 24:50.393
What makes a person poor?

24:50.440 --> 24:54.399
Do I fit the picture?

24:54.450 --> 24:58.614
May be short of gold

24:58.660 --> 25:02.869
But my mind's
Far richer now

25:02.910 --> 25:06.994
Lifted off the ground

25:07.040 --> 25:11.204
My head can't fail me now

25:11.260 --> 25:16.709
There's so much
I have to do

25:16.760 --> 25:20.764
So look at myself
As shadows of others' feet

25:20.810 --> 25:22.880
So defeated

25:22.930 --> 25:26.514
Why is it easy
To let someone

25:26.560 --> 25:29.358
Tell you who you should be?

25:29.400 --> 25:30.776
It's what you see

25:30.820 --> 25:35.769
That really matters

25:37.410 --> 25:38.809
It's what you see

25:38.870 --> 25:40.235
[Violet]
Nova, you in here?

25:40.280 --> 25:43.829
That really matters

25:45.870 --> 25:51.456
It's what you see
That really matters

25:51.500 --> 25:53.331
[Curtis Mayfield]
Only you, babe

25:53.380 --> 25:55.166
[backup singers]
You, babe

25:58.300 --> 25:59.927
Only you, babe

25:59.970 --> 26:01.631
You, babe

26:01.680 --> 26:04.592
Only you, babe

26:04.640 --> 26:06.517
Only you, babe

26:06.560 --> 26:08.050
You, babe

26:11.270 --> 26:13.067
Only you, babe

26:13.110 --> 26:14.350
You, babe

26:14.400 --> 26:16.607
Only you, baby

26:18.610 --> 26:20.862
Beautiful night,
isn't it?

26:20.910 --> 26:22.366
Yes.

26:22.410 --> 26:23.820
Yes, it is.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.860
I'm glad you
can still see it.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.586
Am I that obvious?

26:32.630 --> 26:36.669
No, but I know being
lied to ain't fun.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.041
How you doin'?

26:47.100 --> 26:48.260
You know...

26:50.270 --> 26:52.602
Clare was the love
of my life.

26:52.650 --> 26:55.027
Never wanted to remarry
after she passed.

26:57.570 --> 26:59.697
But she was my second wife,
not my first.

27:02.330 --> 27:03.445
Really?

27:06.410 --> 27:09.072
Your love story doesn't
have to be over, Charley.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.360
It's up to you.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.871
You can stay distracted
by your past,

27:13.920 --> 27:15.751
or focus on your future.

27:20.930 --> 27:23.296
-[tapping glass]
-[Ho||ywood]
All right, everybody.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.215
Ladies and gentlemen,

27:25.260 --> 27:28.673
let's give it up
for the birthday girl.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.551
[cheers and applause]

27:31.600 --> 27:33.306
All right!

27:33.360 --> 27:37.478
Thank y'all for such
a beautiful surprise.

27:37.530 --> 27:40.567
And, uh,
if the rest of 60

27:40.610 --> 27:42.658
is half as fun as today,

27:42.700 --> 27:45.521
I'm gonna be 60
for the next 30 years!

27:45.580 --> 27:47.992
[laughter]

27:48.040 --> 27:51.328
And, of course,
I have to thank the man

27:51.370 --> 27:52.951
that made all this happen.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.912
The man that makes
my heart sing.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.416
My Holleood.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.041
-Mmm.
-[chuckling]

27:59.090 --> 28:01.126
Yeah, baby, this is
all for you, chre.

28:03.680 --> 28:07.059
Everybody put
your damn glasses
in the air!

28:07.100 --> 28:10.388
Vi, I love you so much.

28:12.060 --> 28:14.358
And, baby, I couldn't
be happier than

28:14.400 --> 28:16.891
knowing that I'm gonna
become your husband.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.066
So put your glasses
in the air

28:21.110 --> 28:24.318
for the future
Violet Desonier.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.906
[laughs]

28:25.950 --> 28:27.440
My future wife.

28:27.490 --> 28:30.152
[cheering and applause]

28:37.170 --> 28:38.455
Is she asleep?

28:38.500 --> 28:40.331
She's asleep.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.832
Ha ha.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.428
Well, all right.

28:46.470 --> 28:49.928
Happy birthday

28:49.970 --> 28:52.848
To you

28:52.890 --> 28:56.519
Happy birthday

28:56.560 --> 28:58.221
[laughing]
To you

28:58.270 --> 29:02.229
Holleood,
baby, I'm tired.

29:02.280 --> 29:04.692
Baby, it's your birthday.

29:04.740 --> 29:06.981
You ain't never
said that before.

29:07.030 --> 29:09.362
Yeah? Well,
I'm saying it now.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.499
All right.
Now, what did I do now?

29:16.330 --> 29:17.911
You been acting
funny style

29:17.960 --> 29:19.916
since everybody
started leaving.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.715
I don't want to hurt you,

29:32.890 --> 29:36.849
but the gift I want
is something I already have.

29:38.230 --> 29:40.357
My name.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.692
What you talkin' about?

29:44.740 --> 29:49.234
My name
is Violet Bordelon.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.326
Uh-huh.

29:52.580 --> 29:54.571
And I want to keep it
that way,

29:54.620 --> 29:56.611
even after we're married.

29:59.630 --> 30:04.545
Not Violet Desonier.

30:04.590 --> 30:08.754
Not even
Violet Bordelon-Desonier.

30:08.800 --> 30:13.055
Just Violet Bordelon.

30:13.100 --> 30:15.307
That's what I want
for my birthday.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.226
You're kidding, right?

30:21.150 --> 30:22.526
No, I'm not.

30:22.570 --> 30:25.391
Vi, I don't ask you
for much now.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.987
No, you don't.

30:27.030 --> 30:29.737
Whatever you say
you want to do gets done.

30:32.790 --> 30:36.999
You say don't want
no big wedding.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.702
Fine, we ain't gonna do that.

30:39.750 --> 30:44.369
Say you don't want me
to help you with your business.

30:44.420 --> 30:46.126
It's cool.

30:46.170 --> 30:50.209
It's yours, even though
it's making you sick.

30:50.260 --> 30:52.387
And when you say you don't
need none of my money,

30:52.430 --> 30:55.809
hey, say no more.
Do you.

30:57.770 --> 31:00.398
But, baby,

31:00.440 --> 31:04.888
it's getting to where all I got
left to give you is my name,

31:04.940 --> 31:07.272
and now you tellin' me
you don't want that, neither?

31:11.490 --> 31:13.697
It's like you are hell-bent

31:13.740 --> 31:16.288
on telling me
how much you don't need me

31:16.330 --> 31:19.242
and I don't fit
in your life.

31:25.130 --> 31:27.041
I don't need you.

31:27.090 --> 31:33.598
I mean, not like
most folks talk about.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.756
But I want you.

31:37.980 --> 31:42.849
With everything
I got in me, I want you.

31:47.530 --> 31:50.272
But I don't want
to take your name,

31:51.490 --> 31:53.196
like somebody owns me.

31:53.240 --> 31:56.073
Woman, ain't nobody
ever said nothin' about that.

31:56.120 --> 31:59.408
You taking my name
lets the world know

31:59.460 --> 32:01.360
that I belong to you.

32:02.750 --> 32:05.082
That I'm yours.

32:11.380 --> 32:14.929
I didn't know it was
that important to you.

32:16.850 --> 32:19.421
Yeah, well, me neither,

32:21.060 --> 32:22.049
till right now.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.986
When I was little,
I used to, um,

32:39.040 --> 32:41.031
follow my grandmother
around in the kitchen

32:41.080 --> 32:42.991
with my hands out like this.

32:43.040 --> 32:48.046
She said I was
her little taste tester.

32:48.090 --> 32:51.127
Sometimes me and
my brother would get
into these huge fights

32:51.170 --> 32:53.502
over who would get
to lick the spoon.

32:53.550 --> 32:56.963
Mm. Yeah, don't do that
in Vi's kitchen

32:57.010 --> 32:59.092
if you know
what's good for you.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.176
Is she still with you?

33:02.230 --> 33:03.845
Your wela?

33:05.900 --> 33:11.020
Back in Mexico
with my mom and dad

33:11.070 --> 33:12.947
and my brother
and his family.

33:12.990 --> 33:15.948
I don't see them much.

33:15.990 --> 33:20.404
It's more dangerous
going back and forth these days,

33:20.450 --> 33:23.954
and I've already
been pulled aside

33:24.000 --> 33:27.379
for questioning
a few times, so...

33:31.380 --> 33:33.541
Must be hard
being so far away.

33:33.590 --> 33:35.546
Yeah.

33:35.590 --> 33:39.924
I, um, tend to put
everything into my work,

33:41.600 --> 33:45.184
to keep my mind
off things, you know?

33:45.230 --> 33:46.891
Yeah.

33:46.940 --> 33:50.068
But, yeah, I mean,
I would love to

33:50.110 --> 33:51.975
bring them over eventually.

33:53.610 --> 33:56.989
But my brother
and his wife, uh,

33:57.030 --> 33:58.691
they take good care
of everyone,

33:58.740 --> 34:02.232
so I'm grateful for that.

34:05.620 --> 34:10.660
So, um, did Aunt Vi teach you
how to cook growing up?

34:10.710 --> 34:12.200
[coughs]

34:12.250 --> 34:13.501
Um...

34:15.840 --> 34:18.217
Uh, no.

34:18.260 --> 34:19.887
No, uh...

34:21.510 --> 34:24.923
My version of cooking
is takeout.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.266
Got that from my mom.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.800
Well, then, um,

34:30.860 --> 34:33.351
I guess it's a good thing
that my wela

34:33.400 --> 34:35.106
taught me a thing or two.

34:36.150 --> 34:38.106
Yeah, for next time,

34:38.160 --> 34:42.199
when you, um, come over
and I cook for you.

34:51.000 --> 34:51.989
[groans]

34:54.090 --> 34:55.660
How that sofa workin' out?

34:55.710 --> 34:57.587
Ha ha ha.

34:57.630 --> 34:58.927
You ain't funny.

34:58.970 --> 35:01.040
[laughs]
I ain't tryin' to be.

35:01.090 --> 35:03.718
What happened?

35:03.760 --> 35:07.309
Well, Vi don't
want to be Mrs. Desonier.

35:07.350 --> 35:08.840
She want to keep
her maiden name.

35:08.890 --> 35:11.518
Well, that's
not a big surprise.

35:11.560 --> 35:14.063
I thought you was
the one complaining
about me getting married?

35:14.110 --> 35:17.819
I said don't give up
your dreams for her.

35:17.860 --> 35:19.942
What's that got to do
with a 60-year-old woman

35:19.990 --> 35:22.697
not wanting
to take your name?

35:22.740 --> 35:25.447
You know, Vi is
just now getting to the place

35:25.490 --> 35:27.071
to where she want to be,

35:27.120 --> 35:30.328
and it wasn't _
'cause she was lazy or stupid.

35:30.370 --> 35:34.488
For us, we had to fight
out there in the world

35:34.550 --> 35:35.915
and in our own house.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.700
But that's the past, Momma.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.671
We buildin'
toward a future.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.382
Well, that's good.

35:42.430 --> 35:45.217
But remember this,

35:45.260 --> 35:49.424
just because a woman
come through a battle,

35:49.480 --> 35:51.596
don't mean
she ain't got no scars.

35:51.650 --> 35:55.609
Some things
you will never forget.

35:55.650 --> 35:58.483
You just have to learn
to live with it.

36:05.910 --> 36:07.730
I love you,

36:07.790 --> 36:11.248
and I want you to have

36:11.290 --> 36:12.746
everything you ever wanted,

36:12.790 --> 36:15.452
and I want you to be happy.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.583
But when it comes
to getting married,

36:18.630 --> 36:22.009
you want to make sure

36:22.050 --> 36:24.462
that Vi gives you her heart,

36:25.600 --> 36:27.465
not her name.

36:31.020 --> 36:33.762
Now, go get your girl.

36:40.690 --> 36:43.238
I'm sorry for putting you
on blast at your party.

36:45.990 --> 36:48.367
I appreciate that.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.361
But I'm still _
not changing my mind
about my name.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.490
I don't want you to.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.591
I know I'm blessed

37:15.020 --> 37:18.512
to have a man _
who wants to be mine

37:20.400 --> 37:22.686
as much as he wants me
to be his.

37:27.370 --> 37:32.899
So let's show the world
how we get down.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.746
Biggest they ever seen.

37:34.790 --> 37:36.496
So you want
the big wedding?

37:36.540 --> 37:38.701
Let's blow it out.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.160
Spend that money.

37:40.210 --> 37:41.620
Oh, it's gonna get spent.

37:41.670 --> 37:44.673
[both laughing]

38:00.770 --> 38:01.816
Miss CEO.

38:04.030 --> 38:05.941
Aah! [laughs]

38:12.830 --> 38:15.037
Want me to bring you
back a waffle?

38:16.710 --> 38:19.918
You ain't gotta
bring me nothin' back.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.245
Just have fun with
your momma, all right?

38:22.920 --> 38:24.547
-Hi.
-Mommy!

38:24.590 --> 38:26.000
-Hey, B.
-[Ralph Angel] There she go.

38:26.050 --> 38:27.961
You ready
for a yummy breakfast?

38:28.010 --> 38:29.580
[Blue]
I just gotta brush
my teeth and hair.

38:29.640 --> 38:30.629
Okay.

38:30.680 --> 38:31.920
Okay, get to it.

38:40.190 --> 38:42.567
My bad about the mix-up.

38:42.610 --> 38:46.148
Yeah. Um...

38:46.190 --> 38:48.852
we have to talk
about that.

38:50.030 --> 38:52.237
We need a schedule,

38:52.280 --> 38:53.907
an official one.

38:53.950 --> 38:57.499
I just said you got him
next weekend.

38:57.540 --> 38:59.076
I don't need no schedule.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.826
You can get Blue
whenever you want.

39:02.500 --> 39:07.119
I spent the entire week
painting Blue's room.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.547
I got him tickets
to the museum.

39:10.970 --> 39:13.347
You changed it
at the last minute.

39:13.390 --> 39:16.268
And you knew that
I couldn't go to Vi's party.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.346
It's unacceptable when
it comes to me seeing our son.

39:18.390 --> 39:20.051
You act like I'm trying
to keep him from you.

39:21.610 --> 39:22.895
You know that ain't true.

39:28.530 --> 39:30.657
Who was she?

39:33.450 --> 39:35.736
A work friend.

39:39.120 --> 39:43.580
Well, all I'm saying
is that we need--

39:43.630 --> 39:44.995
we need a schedule.

39:49.670 --> 39:51.331
-Ready!
-Ready!

39:51.380 --> 39:52.631
Bye, Pop!

39:52.680 --> 39:54.170
-Bye.
-[B|ue] Hello!

39:54.220 --> 39:55.710
[Darla] Okay,
so what are you gonna eat?

39:55.760 --> 39:57.216
[Blue]
I'm not sure.

39:57.270 --> 39:58.635
[Darla] They have
really good waffles,

39:58.680 --> 40:00.056
and they have
really good omelets.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.840
I just got the goods
from a friend

40:01.900 --> 40:04.516
in the Houston arm
of a DC. lobbying firm.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.393
Yeah, they're
real cozy over there
in the statehouse.

40:07.440 --> 40:08.930
Well, what'd they say?

40:08.990 --> 40:13.905
Well, the surveyors,
the farm evictions--

40:13.950 --> 40:15.690
it is all adding up.

40:17.660 --> 40:19.901
Charley,
you need to sit down.

40:26.130 --> 40:28.621
Is everything okay, baby?

40:32.680 --> 40:34.420
When we found out

40:34.470 --> 40:37.462
that our land used
to belong to the Landrys,

40:37.510 --> 40:41.879
we realized they didn't
just want our land.

40:41.940 --> 40:45.762
They wanted our land back.

40:45.810 --> 40:48.893
Cold day in hell
before that ever happens.

40:48.940 --> 40:51.147
[Charley]
What they're doing

40:51.190 --> 40:53.738
is much bigger
that we thought.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.532
These are the visual specs

40:59.580 --> 41:01.150
of a planned government
lease project

41:01.200 --> 41:02.781
that's coming to Louisiana.

41:05.290 --> 41:08.032
The Landrys are working
with the government

41:08.090 --> 41:10.376
to build
a private jail here.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.547
-In St. Jo?
-A private...

41:12.590 --> 41:15.718
They're using
their political connections
to win the contract.

41:15.760 --> 41:17.500
They're gonna lease
their land to the government

41:17.550 --> 41:19.927
and cash out.

41:19.970 --> 41:24.555
Our farm,
Rah's farm, is surrounded
by Landry property.

41:26.900 --> 41:29.607
But they need that land
to complete the deal.

41:32.320 --> 41:35.904
They gonna try and take
our daddy's land

41:35.950 --> 41:37.986
so they can build a jail on it?

41:48.500 --> 41:49.740
Hell, no.

41:49.790 --> 41:51.200
That ain't about to happen.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.632
A private jail in St. Jo.

42:26.370 --> 42:27.576
[woman] Go, Ree Ree.
