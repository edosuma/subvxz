05:49.882 --> 05:51.983
TO SEE YOU.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.254
TO SEE YOU.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.658
TO SEE YOU.

05:59.660 --> 06:04.062
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.665
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

06:09.837 --> 06:12.237
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.815
¶ YOU'RE GETTIN' READY TO WORK

06:23.817 --> 06:27.552
¶ IT SEEMS YOU GOT
A BAD CONNECTION ¶

06:27.554 --> 06:29.654
HEY!
¶ NO RECEPTION

06:29.656 --> 06:33.892
¶ WHAT WILL IT TAKE
TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND? ¶

06:33.894 --> 06:36.995
¶ BAD REACTION,
WHAT WOULD- ¶

06:38.932 --> 06:40.699
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:40.701 --> 06:44.870
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
TO CHANGE THE STATION SITUATION.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.706
IT WASN'T. I WAS
LISTENING TO THAT.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.976
I KNOW, BUT IT'S BORING
FOR THE REST OF US.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.879
I WAS FALLING ASLEEP
DOING WORK.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.047
SO WHAT?

06:56.049 --> 06:59.151
SO... I WANT TO PLAY
THIS TAPE.

06:59.153 --> 07:02.187
I WANT TO PLAY THIS TAPE TO
GET MOTIVATED AND PUMPED UP-

07:02.189 --> 07:05.223
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW YOU WANT
TO PLAY THAT TAPE, BUT LOOK.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.459
YOU KNOW WHAT, LANCE? I'M
NOT HERE TO START A FIGHT.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.693
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WANT TO DO,

07:08.695 --> 07:11.029
BUT I NEED TO LISTEN TO MY
LANGUAGE TAPES IN ORDER TO BECOME

07:11.031 --> 07:13.565
PROFICIENT AND PERFORM TO
THE BEST OF MY ABILITIES.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.968
WHAT ABOUT-WHAT ABOUT
THE EQUAL TIME AGREEMENT?

07:16.970 --> 07:19.871
THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO
STUDIES AND EDUCATION.

07:19.873 --> 07:23.074
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THE EQUAL
TIME BOOM BOX AGREEMENT

07:23.076 --> 07:24.976
DOESN'T APPLY
IN THIS CASE, ALL RIGHT?

07:24.978 --> 07:27.479
THAT'S JUST FOR RECREATION. OH, COME ON!

07:27.481 --> 07:30.949
HEY! DON'T PUSH MY BUTTONS, ALL RIGHT?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.551
YOU ARE NOT
THE BOSS HERE.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.454
I AM THE BOSS.
I HIRED YOU.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.088
NOW WE HAVE A LOT
OF WORK TO DO.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.090
WE COULD SIT HERE ARGUING
ABOUT LANGUAGE AND MUSIC

07:39.092 --> 07:41.660
AND BLAH-DE-DE-BLAH, BUT
WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO,

07:41.662 --> 07:43.295
WE GOT A LOT OF LINES
TO PAINT,

07:43.297 --> 07:44.529
AND IT'S
A VERY LONG ROAD.

07:44.531 --> 07:48.066
I SUGGEST YOU START THE
MACHINE AND KEEP IT GOING.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.234
OK.
YEAH.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.802
ALVIN.
YEAH?

07:50.804 --> 07:54.940
YOU HAVE YOUR TOOL BELT
ON BACKWARDS.

08:03.382 --> 08:06.284
LET'S JUST ENJOY
THE SILENCE.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.962
DEAR MADISON,

08:16.964 --> 08:20.632
THANK YOU FOR YOUR
POETIC LETTER.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.305
THERE IS SO LITTLE
TO DO OUT HERE.

08:27.307 --> 08:31.409
I MUST HAVE READ IT
A HUNDRED TIMES.

08:33.111 --> 08:38.015
BEING OUT HERE HELPS ME
SEE THINGS MORE CLEARLY.

08:38.650 --> 08:42.087
SOMETIMES IT'S HEAVEN,
SOMETIMES IT'S HELL,

08:42.089 --> 08:44.856
BUT OUT-OF-DOORS PHYSICAL LABOR
IS JUST WHAT I NEED

08:44.858 --> 08:47.125
AFTER THOSE ENDLESS
NIGHT SHIFTS IN GARLAND,

08:47.127 --> 08:52.731
WHICH CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTED TO
OUR TROUBLES DURING THE SPRING.

08:53.900 --> 08:59.905
I DO FEEL MUCH BETTER,
ALTHOUGH I MISS YOU AND OLIVE.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.841
I CAN'T SAY I MISS CITY LIFE.

09:02.843 --> 09:07.078
I WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE I WAS ONE
OF THOSE HEADS CARVED INTO THE MOUNTAINS

09:07.080 --> 09:10.282
OF THOSE PRESIDENTS OF THE
UNITED STATES IN THE DAKOTAS,

09:10.284 --> 09:14.286
LONELY AMONG ALL THOSE PEOPLE
I COULDN'T TALK TO.

09:14.288 --> 09:15.987
AS FOR YOUR BROTHER,

09:15.989 --> 09:18.056
THE COUNTRYSIDE ISN'T
TEACHING HIM ANYTHING

09:18.058 --> 09:21.059
OTHER THAN HOW MUCH HE MISSES
THE BIG, ACTIVE NIGHTLIFE.

09:21.061 --> 09:26.698
I THINK THAT YOU AND THE FAMILY NEED TO THINK
OF SOMETHING ELSE AS FAR AS HIS OCCUPATION.

09:26.700 --> 09:31.369
HE, QUITE REALISTICALLY, COULD
NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING.

09:31.371 --> 09:35.040
HOW CAN YOU BE HIS AGE
AND NOT KNOW HOW TO GUT A FISH

09:35.042 --> 09:37.742
OR BUILD A TENT OR TIE A KNOT?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.779
SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF HE IS LEARNING-DISABLED

09:40.781 --> 09:42.948
OR HAS A BAD DISEASE,

09:42.950 --> 09:45.550
NOT THAT I DISLIKE HIM
OR ANYTHING.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.320
HE'S TOTALLY FINE.

09:48.322 --> 09:50.522
ALVIN, I'M FINISHED.
HMM?

09:50.524 --> 09:53.658
I'M DONE WITH THIS ONE.
COULD I HAVE ANOTHER ONE?

09:53.660 --> 09:55.360
YEAH, WELL, PUT THAT ONE BACK. OK.

09:55.362 --> 09:59.631
WAIT, YOU DIDN'T DO
- YOU DIDN'T WRITE IN IT, DID YOU?

09:59.633 --> 10:02.000
YEAH. I WORKED
THE PUZZLE.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.635
OH, NO-DON'T DO THAT.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.903
DON'T DO THAT, PLEASE.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.505
THAT'S A COLLECTOR'S ITEM.
IT'S AN ANTIQUE.

10:07.507 --> 10:08.807
IT'S RARE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

10:08.809 --> 10:12.444
I'M OUT HERE TO HAVE MY THINGS
TREATED WELL, WITH RESPECT.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.512
I GET IT.
I GET IT, YEAH.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.448
DO YOU, REALLY?

10:16.450 --> 10:17.649
YEAH.
YOU HEARING?

10:17.651 --> 10:18.850
YOU ARE HEARING ME?
YES, YES.

10:18.852 --> 10:19.951
I GET IT.
ARE YOU HEARING ME?

10:19.953 --> 10:22.120
YES. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ME WITH?

10:22.122 --> 10:25.123
NO. I DON'T WANT YOU TO JUST
HEAR ME WITH YOUR EARS.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.393
I WANT YOU TO HEAR
THE WHOLE THING.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.229
OK.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.104
THE WEEKEND IS COMING,

10:39.106 --> 10:42.474
AND I'M THINKING OF SPENDING
SOME QUIET TIME ALONE.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.509
YOUR BROTHER,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

10:44.511 --> 10:46.444
CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK
TO THE BIG CITY

10:46.446 --> 10:50.915
AND GET THE LITTLE MAN
SQUEEZED, AS HE PUTS IT.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.618
AS FOR ME, I'VE BEEN
STUDYING TONS

10:53.620 --> 11:00.625
YOU'RE RIGHT; IF I DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE,
WE'LL NEVER ADAPT TO LIFE WITH THE NATIVES.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.161
BESIDES, THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR ME IN GARLAND,

11:03.163 --> 11:07.966
AND THIS NEW LIFE CAN ONLY BE
GOOD FOR OUR LITTLE FAMILY.

11:07.968 --> 11:11.202
YOURS, ALVIN.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.972
P.S. -

11:43.569 --> 11:48.973
Alvin.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.415
WHAT?

12:00.753 --> 12:03.455
NEVER MIND.

12:35.121 --> 12:37.689
HEY! HEY!

12:37.691 --> 12:41.159
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE GODDAMN ROAD?

12:41.161 --> 12:44.763
WE'RE WORKING
ON THE ROAD CREW.

12:44.765 --> 12:45.697
THE STRIPE CREW.

12:45.699 --> 12:48.032
WELL,
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.702
I'M GOING UP
AND DOWN THIS ROAD

12:50.704 --> 12:54.005
WITH A HEAVY LOAD TRYING
TO GET THROUGH THE PASS.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.874
THEY FINALLY MOVED
ALL THE BOULDERS.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.008
YEAH, IT GOT
ALL MESSED UP.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.676
YEAH,
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.346
HEY, YOU GUYS GOT
TIME FOR A DRINK?

13:01.348 --> 13:04.582
HEH HEH!
THERE YOU GO.

13:04.584 --> 13:05.950
HA HA HA!

13:05.952 --> 13:06.918
HERE.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.853
TAKE THAT.
THANK YOU.

13:08.855 --> 13:12.490
YEAH, LET ME TAKE THEM TOPS OFF FOR YOU.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.626
HEH HEH!

13:14.628 --> 13:19.998
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. I FORGOT
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.334
HOW ABOUT WE SPICE
IT UP A LITTLE?

13:23.336 --> 13:24.836
OH.
OH, YEAH.

13:24.838 --> 13:25.970
DUMP SOME
OF THAT OUT.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.705
WE DON'T NEED
THAT SODA POP THERE.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.541
HERE, GIVE ME SOME
OF THAT THERE.

13:29.543 --> 13:31.576
OK, HOLD THAT
THERE.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.544
HA HA HA HA!

13:32.546 --> 13:34.212
ALL RIGHT,
HERE WE GO.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.718
HERE'S TO FIRE
IN OUR HEARTS.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.187
DRINK UP, BOYS.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.655
I LOVE
THE IMPURITIES.

13:43.657 --> 13:44.722
OOH. NICE.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.292
MOTHER, MAY I?
YES, I MAY.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.694
HA!

13:49.696 --> 13:51.930
MMM!

13:52.765 --> 13:56.067
SO, IT WAS YOU
PAINTED THESE,

13:56.069 --> 13:59.871
ALVIN DID MOST OF THEM. I
JUST STARTED WORKING FOR HIM.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.005
HOW MANY'D
YOU DO?

14:01.007 --> 14:02.273
I HAVEN'T KEPT
AN EXACT COUNT,

14:02.275 --> 14:04.609
BUT I'VE HAMMERED IN
A BOATLOAD OF POSTS

14:04.611 --> 14:06.244
AND PAINTED A WHOLE
BUNCH OF STRIPES.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.681
YEAH, DON'T FORGET THE POSTS.
THE POSTS ARE IMPORTANT.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.249
YEAH, YOU'RE TELLING ME.

14:11.251 --> 14:15.220
YOU KNOW, WOULD IT BE ALL
RIGHT IF I HAD ONE OF THOSE?

14:17.623 --> 14:20.225
ALL RIGHT.

14:20.626 --> 14:24.996
DO YOU HAVE A LIGHT,
BY CHANCE? I, UH...

14:25.631 --> 14:27.832
THANK YOU.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.169
NOTHING BUT DESIRE, HUH?

14:31.171 --> 14:33.371
OOH.
MMM.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.007
YOU GOT IT?

14:36.609 --> 14:37.976
I KNOW HOW.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.911
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT?

14:39.913 --> 14:41.079
YOU SHOULDN'T
SMOKE.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.181
OH, YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S BAD FOR YOU.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.783
NO, I MEAN YOU
SHOULDN'T SMOKE.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.653
YOU LOOK STUPID.

14:50.756 --> 14:53.024
YOU BEEN
OUT HERE FOR A WHILE?

14:53.026 --> 14:54.626
LONGER THAN YOU WANT
TO KNOW, SON.

14:54.628 --> 14:56.628
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M DOING OUT HERE, MAN.

14:56.630 --> 14:59.264
THERE'S NO GIRLS
OUT HERE AT ALL.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.933
WELL, YOU GOT
TO TAKE CARE OF THAT

15:01.935 --> 15:03.234
ON THE WEEKEND.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.869
YOU GOT TO GO TO TOWN,

15:04.871 --> 15:06.537
MEET A LADY.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.505
BUT, UH...

15:07.507 --> 15:10.508
I CAN'T DISCUSS THAT
TOO MUCH 'CAUSE,

15:10.510 --> 15:12.343
YOU KNOW,
I GOT A LOT

15:12.345 --> 15:14.145
OF BAD MEMORIES
THERE, YOU KNOW.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.313
REALLY?
YEAH.

15:15.315 --> 15:19.050
SOMETIMES YOU GET INVOLVED
A LITTLE TOO YOUNG,

15:19.052 --> 15:22.153
THINGS HAPPEN AND
THEN MORE THINGS HAPPEN

15:22.155 --> 15:23.488
AND SHE TAKES OFF,

15:23.490 --> 15:25.089
MAYBE TAKES
THE CHILD WITH HER.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.626
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW.
THAT CAN BE PRETTY ROUGH.

15:28.628 --> 15:34.365
WELL, I GOT TO GO. I'M TIRED
OF FOOLING WITH YOU GUYS.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.567
HERE. SAY...

15:36.569 --> 15:37.869
TAKE THAT.

15:37.871 --> 15:40.038
OH, NO.
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.541
NO. JUST MY WAY OF SAYING THANK YOU.

15:43.543 --> 15:44.876
OH, THANK YOU.

15:44.878 --> 15:45.977
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.112
TAKE CARE OF THAT.
THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.615
THANK YOU.

15:54.353 --> 15:55.486
HA HA HA HA!

17:48.233 --> 17:50.735
AREN'T YOU GONNA
EAT THAT?

17:50.737 --> 17:51.436
WHAT?

17:51.438 --> 17:53.704
AREN'T YOU GONNA
EAT THAT?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.807
THE SKIN?
YEAH.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.041
NO.

17:57.043 --> 18:00.545
THE MOST
NUTRITIOUS PART.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.357
OH, GOD. FARTS?

18:13.359 --> 18:17.395
WE'RE HAVING A VERY NICE
EVENING. ENJOY YOUR HOT FISH.

18:17.397 --> 18:21.332
SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU REALLY COOL
NOT GETTING LAID ALL SUMMER?

18:21.334 --> 18:24.602
I DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH
OF A CHOICE, DO I?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.170
I MEAN, WHEN YOU
WERE OUT HERE

18:26.172 --> 18:28.106
FOR THE SPRING
BY YOURSELF,

18:28.108 --> 18:30.875
DIDN'T YOU GET LONELY,
LIKE, SO LONELY?

18:30.877 --> 18:34.612
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
BEING LONELY AND BEING ALONE.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.614
THERE IS?
OH, YEAH.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.817
I REAP THE REWARDS
OF SOLITUDE.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.653
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.388
WELL...

18:44.390 --> 18:47.458
I WRITE LETTERS
TO YOUR SISTER,

18:47.460 --> 18:49.560
I... READ,

18:49.562 --> 18:55.333
I HAD A CAT, SO I USED TO TAKE
CARE OF MY PET BEFORE IT WAS KILLED.

18:55.335 --> 18:58.669
I HAVE A LOT OF
PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS,

18:58.671 --> 19:00.738
BUT I TRY NOT
TO USE THEM.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.340
WOW.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.841
I DON'T KNOW.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.410
I GET SO HORNY
OUT HERE IN NATURE.

19:06.412 --> 19:11.015
DON'T YOU? HORNY? I DON'T THINK SO.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.986
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.288
DOES IT, LIKE...
FEEL DIFFERENT

19:17.290 --> 19:20.591
HAVING SEX WITH A
WOMAN THAT'S HAD A BABY?

19:20.593 --> 19:24.896
YOU KNOW, LIKE, MADISON. SHE'S HAD KIDS.

19:24.898 --> 19:27.431
MM-HMM. YEAH.

19:27.433 --> 19:30.101
IS IT, LIKE...

19:30.103 --> 19:31.202
LESS TIGHT?

19:31.204 --> 19:32.670
LANCE,
SHE'S YOUR SISTER.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.006
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.440
I COULD NEVER LAST
THE WHOLE SUMMER

19:36.442 --> 19:38.342
WITHOUT GETTING THE LITTLE MAN SQUEEZED.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.745
YOU SUGGESTING I CHEAT
ON YOUR SISTER?

19:40.747 --> 19:44.515
YOU'VE HEARD THE STORY
ABOUT TRISTAN, RIGHT?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.751
TRISTAN, YOUR COUSIN?

19:46.753 --> 19:49.053
NO.

19:49.055 --> 19:53.558
THAT GUY. HASN'T MADISON
EVER TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM?

19:53.560 --> 19:54.559
NO.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.762
DON'T YOU GUYS TALK
ABOUT STUFF?

19:57.764 --> 20:00.431
WELL, DON'T YOU KNOW
WHO SHE SLEPT WITH?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.633
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT WHO SHE SLEPT WITH?

20:02.635 --> 20:07.638
WELL, YOU KNOW HER BEDROOM WAS
NEXT DOORS TO MINE IN HIGH SCHOOL,

20:07.640 --> 20:12.944
AND YOU COULD JUST HEAR
THE MOANING AND STUFF.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.115
WHAT?

20:18.117 --> 20:21.052
DO YOU THINK
SHE WAS A VIRGIN?

21:10.869 --> 21:13.571
DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS
FOR THE WEEKEND?

21:13.573 --> 21:15.506
ANYTHING YOU'RE
GETTING INTO?

21:15.508 --> 21:17.241
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:17.243 --> 21:20.144
DO YOU HAVE YOUR EYE
ON ANYONE?

21:20.146 --> 21:23.381
YOU KNOW, A GIRL.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.516
NO.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.203
HEY, ALVIN.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.305
YEAH?

21:47.307 --> 21:48.606
I LIED TO YOU.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.809
I DO HAVE MY EYE
ON SOMEONE WHO'S A GIRL.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.544
YEAH?
YEAH.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.446
HER NAME IS
MAGGIE JOHNSTON.

21:55.448 --> 21:59.417
SHE'S A TOTAL GODDESS. I'VE
BEEN WORKING ON HER FOR A WHILE.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.118
NICE.
YEAH.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.220
BUT I KINDA
MESSED IT UP, THOUGH.

22:03.222 --> 22:04.355
I LOST HER
TO MY FRIEND KIP,

22:04.357 --> 22:06.390
BUT I THINK THEY WERE ON
THE ROAD TO SPLITTING UP

22:06.392 --> 22:10.628
IF THE WAY SHE WAS BEHAVING LAST TIME I SAW
HER AT THE DANCE CLUB WAS ANY INDICATION.

22:10.630 --> 22:13.497
PROBLEMS IN
THE RELATIONSHIP?

22:13.499 --> 22:14.765
PROBABLY BY NOW.

22:14.767 --> 22:18.235
IS SHE, UH,
GIVING OFF SIGNALS?

22:18.237 --> 22:19.904
SIGNALS?

22:19.906 --> 22:23.874
WELL, SHE WAS MAKING OUT
WITH ME IN A TOILET,

22:23.876 --> 22:26.043
IF THAT'S A SIGNAL.

22:26.045 --> 22:26.811
WHAT?

22:26.813 --> 22:28.179
SOMEONE KNOCKED
ON THE DOOR.

22:28.181 --> 22:31.415
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GONE FULL
LAMB CHOP IF NO ONE HAD KNOCKED.

22:31.417 --> 22:34.051
WITH YOUR FRIEND KIP'S GIRLFRIEND? YEAH.

22:34.053 --> 22:37.955
PROBABLY
EX-GIRLFRIEND BY NOW.

22:42.694 --> 22:46.063
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO
COME INTO THE CITY THIS WEEKEND?

22:46.065 --> 22:49.867
YOU COULD CRASH AT MY
PARENTS' PLACE WITH ME. NO.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.369
THANKS, THOUGH.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.871
I'M GONNA STAY HERE.

22:53.873 --> 22:57.808
I COULD USE
THE SOLO TIME.

22:58.377 --> 23:02.313
NOT ME.
I GET LONELY.

23:11.289 --> 23:14.625
WHAT'S UP?

23:19.766 --> 23:22.633
THERE'S BIRDS IN HERE.

24:09.314 --> 24:11.816
OH, SO JUST, UH,
TOSS ME THE KEYS

24:11.818 --> 24:13.617
AND I'LL PICK YOU
UP ON MONDAY.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.353
YOU NEED ANY HELP WITH
THE CAMP, SETTING UP?

24:16.355 --> 24:18.756
SURE.

24:18.758 --> 24:22.827
YOU KNOW WHAT? DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT. I'LL GET IT. OH.

24:22.829 --> 24:26.497
BUT YOU DO HAVE
TO DO ONE THING.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.434
I WANT YOU TO MAIL THAT
FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

24:30.436 --> 24:34.238
IT'S FOR YOUR SISTER, AND THERE'S
MONEY IN THERE, SO BE CAREFUL WITH IT.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.574
SWEET. HOW MUCH?

24:36.576 --> 24:38.509
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

24:38.511 --> 24:41.245
AW, COME ON. HOW MUCH?
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.647
WHY DOESN'T SHE GET A JOB?
WHY DO YOU SEND HER MONEY?

24:43.649 --> 24:45.716
SHE'S GOT A LOT GOING ON.
NO, SHE DOESN'T.

24:45.718 --> 24:48.752
SHE STAYS AT HOME AND TALKS
ON THE PHONE AND CHEWS GUM.

24:48.754 --> 24:50.855
YEAH, SHE'S RAISING
HER CHILD.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.756
WHO'S IN SCHOOL
ALL DAY.

24:52.758 --> 24:55.626
SO YOU JUST TAKE OFF
AND BUST YOUR ASS

24:55.628 --> 24:56.961
AND SEND MONEY
BACK HOME?

24:56.963 --> 24:59.296
IT'S CALLED LOVE.
I DON'T GET IT.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.899
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU
DON'T HAVE TO GET IT, ALL RIGHT?

25:01.901 --> 25:04.268
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
MAIL THAT LETTER.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.171
OH, AND ONE MORE THING.
LANCE!

25:07.173 --> 25:09.907
WHAT?

25:10.709 --> 25:12.343
HAVE FUN.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.912
THANKS.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.786
AH.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.510
HELLO.

30:47.412 --> 30:50.013
WAS THIS YOUR HOUSE?

30:50.015 --> 30:51.248
WAS.

30:51.250 --> 30:55.819
HA HA! PAST TENSE.
EVERYTHING'S PAST TENSE NOW. HA!

30:55.821 --> 30:57.754
THIS IS THE BEDROOM,

30:57.756 --> 31:00.090
AND OUR BED WAS ON
THIS FLAT AREA.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.825
THIS WAS YOUR BED?

31:01.827 --> 31:03.493
THIS WAS IT. HA HA!

31:03.495 --> 31:06.563
AND THIS WAS ON
THE BACK OF THE BED.

31:06.565 --> 31:09.533
ENVISION A TALL CASE
UP ON LEGS,

31:09.535 --> 31:11.301
AND IT HAD A WHOLE LOT
OF DRAWERS.

31:11.303 --> 31:15.205
AND THEY JUST FIT THERE
PERFECTLY. IT WAS LIKE, UM...

31:15.207 --> 31:18.008
THE HOUSE WAS WAITING
FOR MY-HA HA! -

31:18.010 --> 31:21.411
MY FURNITURE. HA!

31:22.080 --> 31:23.847
I SPEAK
A LITTLE GERMAN,

31:23.849 --> 31:27.584
FROM WHEN I USED
TO LIVE OVER THERE.

31:29.988 --> 31:31.355
ALL THE...

31:31.357 --> 31:35.058
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE-
ARE LIKE MEMORIES,

31:35.060 --> 31:40.597
AND SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
I'M DIGGING IN MY OWN ASHES.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.600
UM...

31:43.868 --> 31:46.436
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE
THAT AF-

31:46.438 --> 31:50.674
YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH
THE FIRE WAS, UH,

31:50.676 --> 31:53.677
I GUESS, WHAT,
6, 7 MONTHS?

31:53.679 --> 31:58.382
9? I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
SINCE THE FIRE.

31:58.384 --> 31:59.850
UM...

31:59.852 --> 32:02.686
BUT IT'S HARDER
FOR YOU NOW-

32:02.688 --> 32:05.822
HARDER FOR ME NOW,
ANYWAY.

32:05.824 --> 32:07.925
I THOUGHT I WAS STRONG

32:07.927 --> 32:11.028
AND... ADAPTABLE

32:11.030 --> 32:12.829
AND, UM...

32:12.831 --> 32:17.334
YOU KNOW, HOW'S ANYBODY
GONNA PROVE

32:17.336 --> 32:19.569
THAT-THAT...

32:19.571 --> 32:24.942
YOU KNOW, I HAD ALL THESE
EXPERIENCES AND THE, UH...

32:24.944 --> 32:28.078
FLYING AND, UM-

32:28.080 --> 32:29.446
FLYING?

32:29.448 --> 32:34.885
I'M JUST LOOKING FOR THE
PILOT'S LICENSE WITH THE LOGBOOK.

32:34.887 --> 32:38.622
WAS THE PILOT'S LICENSE
A PIECE OF PAPER?

32:38.624 --> 32:42.759
YEAH, A LITTLE CARD
AND A BOOK.

32:42.761 --> 32:46.363
THE LOGBOOK WAS
LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW.

32:46.365 --> 32:50.500
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD
HAVE BURNED UP?

32:55.239 --> 32:57.874
I GUESS SO.

32:58.910 --> 33:00.811
BUT, UH...

33:00.813 --> 33:03.013
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN MIRACLES HAPPEN.

33:03.015 --> 33:06.583
YOU COULD FIND IT,
I GUESS.

33:06.718 --> 33:08.352
OH.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.587
YOU, TOO.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.804
HONEY?

33:27.806 --> 33:29.873
I'M HOME.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.609
SWEETIE-
OH, IT SMELLS GOOD.

33:32.611 --> 33:35.379
OOH, WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?

33:35.381 --> 33:37.481
MMM.

33:38.816 --> 33:41.151
SWEETHEART.

33:41.153 --> 33:44.521
NICE LITTLE BIRDS.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.527
HMM.

33:52.697 --> 33:55.932
SWEETIE? WHERE ARE YOU?

33:55.934 --> 33:58.535
UPSTAIRS?

34:06.077 --> 34:08.210
BABE?

34:09.714 --> 34:12.382
SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE ON THE PHONE.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.583
NO, NO, NO, IT'S OK.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET OFF.

34:14.585 --> 34:17.187
I'M JUST GONNA
GO DOWNSTAIRS.

34:17.188 --> 34:19.822
BYE.

34:25.196 --> 34:27.831
IT WAS GOOD.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.503
HEY, MAN.

35:40.371 --> 35:42.606
HEY, WELCOME BACK.

35:42.608 --> 35:43.940
HI.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.109
YEAH, YOU'RE
LOOKING GOOD.

35:46.111 --> 35:47.677
HUH?
YOU LOOK FRESH.

35:47.679 --> 35:51.581
YOUR OUTFIT, YOUR
ENSEMBLE. YOU LOOK SHARP.

35:52.183 --> 35:54.351
MOVE IT.

35:58.956 --> 36:01.791
LITTLE LAB COAT?

36:01.793 --> 36:03.126
YEAH.

36:03.128 --> 36:05.729
BOUGHT MYSELF THIS COAT.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.097
VERY COOL.

36:07.099 --> 36:09.966
HOW WAS
YOUR WEEKEND?

36:11.369 --> 36:12.869
NEW WATCH?

36:12.871 --> 36:15.272
YEAH. I SPLURGED.

36:15.274 --> 36:17.908
OH, COOL.
IS IT WATERPROOF?

36:17.910 --> 36:19.976
YEAH, TO, LIKE,
50 METERS.

36:19.978 --> 36:22.179
IT'S GOT DAILY ALARM,

36:22.181 --> 36:23.847
WORLD TIMER,

36:23.849 --> 36:25.382
COUNTDOWN.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.584
COST 38 BUCKS.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.286
WOW.

36:30.288 --> 36:31.621
SHOCKPROOF.

36:31.623 --> 36:34.658
WOW.
PRETTY NEW-WAVE.

36:34.660 --> 36:37.427
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE BACK.

36:37.429 --> 36:41.731
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO TODAY, OK?

36:44.602 --> 36:46.570
YOU OK?

36:46.572 --> 36:49.172
YEAH, OK.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.778
OK.

37:50.635 --> 37:51.801
OH.

37:51.803 --> 37:55.372
SORRY.
I GOT CAULK ON YOU.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.577
HILARIOUS.

38:17.094 --> 38:19.996
SO NOTHING HAPPENED?

38:19.998 --> 38:21.965
HUH?

38:21.967 --> 38:23.366
THIS WEEKEND.

38:23.368 --> 38:26.636
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING?
DIDN'T CUT LOOSE?

38:26.638 --> 38:29.306
COME ON.
WHAT'S THE SCOOP?

38:29.308 --> 38:30.974
OH. NO.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.176
WHAT ABOUT
PEGGY JACKSON?

38:33.178 --> 38:34.644
PEGGY?
YEAH.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.547
YOU MEAN MAGGIE
JOHNSTON? MAGGIE JOHNSTON.

38:37.549 --> 38:40.317
YOU DIDN'T GET THE LITTLE MAN SQUEEZED?

38:40.319 --> 38:42.452
NOPE.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.089
THAT'S TOO BAD.

39:10.848 --> 39:14.584
WHAT ABOUT HER BOYFRIEND?
SHE BREAK UP WITH HIM?

39:14.586 --> 39:15.752
SORT OF.

39:15.754 --> 39:18.021
HEY. SO WHAT'S
THE PROBLEM?

39:18.023 --> 39:21.558
CAN'T WE JUST LISTEN
TO THE SILENCE?

39:21.560 --> 39:25.161
YEAH, SURE.

39:30.868 --> 39:34.404
SO NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF FINGERING?

39:34.406 --> 39:38.174
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

39:38.509 --> 39:42.011
IT WAS A REALLY
STUPID WEEKEND.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.947
OH?

39:43.949 --> 39:46.516
DO TELL.

39:47.985 --> 39:49.119
YEAH.

39:49.121 --> 39:51.621
IT ALL STARTED
JUST AFTER I LEFT.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.990
I WASN'T EVEN NEAR HIDDEN
RIDGE AND I GOT A FLAT TIRE.

39:53.992 --> 39:58.294
I'D BEEN DRIVING FOR LESS THAN AN
HOUR, AND I RAN OVER A SHARP OBJECT.

39:58.296 --> 40:01.431
YOU EVER HAD TO CHANGE A
TIRE ON A TRUCK LIKE THAT?

40:01.433 --> 40:03.767
YEAH.
IT'S SO HARD.

40:03.769 --> 40:04.868
MM-HMM.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.537
IT TOOK ME SO LONG.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.439
I MEAN-

40:09.441 --> 40:11.107
IT TOOK ME A GREAT LENGTH
OF TIME TO CHANGE THE TIRE,

40:11.109 --> 40:14.878
SO, LIKE, I DIDN'T EVEN GET HOME
UNTIL, LIKE, MIDNIGHT OR SOMETHING.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.447
AND I WAS COVERED
IN GREASE AND VERY GROSS,

40:17.449 --> 40:19.883
SO I WENT INTO MY KITCHEN
AND HAD SOME SALSA

40:19.885 --> 40:22.919
AND HAD A BEER,
AND THEN...

40:22.921 --> 40:25.722
THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW...

40:25.724 --> 40:30.427
WELL, THAT'S-THAT'S YOUR BODY
TELLING YOU IT'S EXHAUSTED.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.695
IT'S WEIRD.
NO, IT'S NOT THAT WEIRD.

40:32.697 --> 40:35.832
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN OUT HERE
WORKING HARD FOR ALMOST 5 DAYS.

40:35.834 --> 40:39.936
NO, YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD
THE WEIRD PART, DUMMY.

40:39.938 --> 40:43.540
I FELL ASLEEP RIGHT IN
THE MIDDLE OF MY KITCHEN,

40:43.542 --> 40:47.010
AND I WAS STANDING
STRAIGHT UP.

40:48.313 --> 40:52.916
AND I DIDN'T WAKE UP UNTIL MY MOM
AND DAD WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING

40:52.918 --> 40:55.285
AND CAME DOWN FOR BREAKFAST
AND HAD SNACKS.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.987
AND THEY JUST SAW YOU
STANDING THERE, SLEEPING? YEAH.

40:57.989 --> 41:00.824
SO I DIDN'T GET A PARTY FRIDAY
NIGHT, WHICH WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING,

41:00.826 --> 41:04.494
BUT I FIGURED, HEY, I'LL BE IN
GOOD SHAPE FOR SATURDAY NIGHT.

41:04.496 --> 41:07.430
SO I HIT THE BARS WITH SOME
BUDDIES AND WE HAD SOME COCKTAILS.

41:07.432 --> 41:10.300
RIGHT AWAY, I SAW TWO CHICKS WHO
WOULD TOTALLY HAVE PARTIED WITH ME.

41:10.302 --> 41:13.436
I'D ACTUALLY... I'D ACTUALLY
SCREWED ONE OF THEM BEFORE,

41:13.438 --> 41:16.606
WHICH WAS OK, BUT SHE HAD
THESE FAT LITTLE LEGS,

41:16.608 --> 41:22.412
AND WHENEVER WE WOULD MAKE LOVE, SHE
WOULD ALWAYS FLAP HER ARMS UP AND DOWN

41:22.414 --> 41:25.048
LIKE SHE WAS TRYING TO FLY.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.016
MAYBE SHE WAS
TRYING TO ESCAPE.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.351
NO, NO, NO, NO.

41:28.353 --> 41:31.154
ORGASMS.
SHE JUST GETS EXCITED.

41:31.156 --> 41:34.357
FANTASTIC.

41:34.359 --> 41:38.895
AND SO I'D ALREADY DECIDED I
WAS GOING TO SLEEP WITH PEGGY.

41:38.897 --> 41:40.463
I MEAN MAGGIE.
MM-HMM?

41:40.465 --> 41:43.733
OR SOMEONE
OF THAT QUALITY.

41:43.735 --> 41:47.871
SO WE GO TO THE BUB CLUB,
AND THEN SHE SHOWS UP.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.772
MAGGIE?
YEAH.

41:49.774 --> 41:51.140
MAGGIE JOHNSTON-

41:51.142 --> 41:53.209
LOOKING SO FOXY,
AS ALWAYS-

41:53.211 --> 41:55.912
AND I'M SENSING THAT SHE'S
REALLY INTO ME AS WELL.

41:55.914 --> 42:00.049
YOU KNOW, SO WE GO, WE HIT THE
DANCE FLOOR, AND IT'S LINING UP NICE

42:00.051 --> 42:02.485
BECAUSE... WE'RE BOTH
REALLY GOOD DANCERS.

42:02.487 --> 42:06.523
AND I HAVE TO DANCE TWICE AS HARD TO
COMPETE WITH THESE YOUNGER GUYS, YOU KNOW?

42:06.525 --> 42:12.095
I MEAN, I'M NOT AS FRESH AS I USED
TO BE, NOW THAT I'M ALL FAT AND OLD.

42:12.097 --> 42:14.697
AND THEN IT'S CLOSING
TIME, AND I ASK HER

42:14.699 --> 42:17.233
TO COME HOME WITH ME, BUT SHE
REALLY WANTS TO KEEP PARTYING.

42:17.235 --> 42:21.738
AND THERE'S AN AFTER PARTY AT HER
FRIEND'S MOM'S HOUSE, SO I'M LIKE, OK,

42:21.740 --> 42:26.976
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY
HAVE A CHOICE IF I WANT TO SCORE.

42:28.046 --> 42:32.148
AND THEN I GET THIS FEELING
LIKE IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

42:32.150 --> 42:34.384
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
I MEAN...

42:34.386 --> 42:38.521
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M PSYCHIC OR
ANYTHING, BUT IT'S JUST SOMETIMES

42:38.523 --> 42:40.156
I FEEL LIKE I CAN...

42:40.158 --> 42:42.592
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? INTUITION.

42:42.594 --> 42:47.764
YEAH. IT'S JUST THAT SOMETIMES
I KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

42:47.766 --> 42:51.234
SO WE GO TO THE PARTY,
AND WE START LAUGHING

42:51.236 --> 42:52.936
AND I TAKE HER INTO
THIS BEDROOM

42:52.938 --> 42:55.572
AND WE START MAKING OUT
AND I START FINGERING HER.

42:55.574 --> 42:59.642
AND I CAN TELL HOW
HORNY SHE IS FOR ME.

42:59.644 --> 43:02.879
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
SHE ASKS ME TO STOP.

43:02.881 --> 43:05.982
YOU KNOW, SHE GOT PARANOID OR
SOMETHING, LIKE SHE HEARD SOMETHING.

43:05.984 --> 43:10.453
I GET HER TO PROMISE ME THAT SHE'LL
COME HOME WITH ME AFTER THE PARTY.

43:10.455 --> 43:12.622
WELL, YOU KNOW,
OBVIOUSLY.

43:12.624 --> 43:16.426
AND SHE SAYS YEAH.
YOU KNOW, SHE SAYS OK.

43:16.428 --> 43:19.062
SO THEN WE LEAVE
THE BEDROOM,

43:19.064 --> 43:21.431
AND WE WALK SMACK
INTO KIP.

43:21.433 --> 43:23.633
YOUR FRIEND KIP?

43:23.635 --> 43:24.601
NO.

43:24.603 --> 43:27.270
MY EX-FRIEND KIP.

43:27.272 --> 43:28.404
AH. I SEE.

43:28.406 --> 43:30.640
AND EVEN BEFORE
I REALIZE WHO IT IS,

43:30.642 --> 43:34.410
HE'S ALREADY FURIOUS
AT SEEING US TOGETHER...

43:35.547 --> 43:37.880
AND HE PUNCHES ME
IN THE FACE.

43:37.882 --> 43:39.315
OH.

43:39.317 --> 43:40.617
HE NAILED YOU.
YEAH.

43:40.619 --> 43:42.785
SO SHE STARTS YELLING
AT HIM AND CRYING,

43:42.787 --> 43:44.320
TELLING HIM
HOW SORRY SHE IS,

43:44.322 --> 43:47.890
AND I'M JUST SITTING THERE,
YOU KNOW, HOLDING MY FACE.

43:47.892 --> 43:50.994
AND THEN THEY LEAVE AND
SHE'S COMPLETELY HYSTERICAL,

43:50.996 --> 43:55.398
BUT SHE LEAVES WITH KIP
AND DOESN'T SAY GOOD-BYE.

43:56.367 --> 43:59.302
YOU KNOW,
AND HE'S PISSED.

43:59.304 --> 44:02.805
I MEAN, HE'S FREAKING OUT.
HE REALLY SHOULDN'T DRINK.

44:02.807 --> 44:04.674
REALLY?
YEAH.

44:04.676 --> 44:06.075
YOU KNOW?

44:06.077 --> 44:09.679
HE'S A COMPLETE JERK
WHEN HE DRINKS.

44:09.681 --> 44:11.447
SO, WITH THEM GONE,

44:11.449 --> 44:14.450
YOU KNOW, I FIGURE I'LL JUST
SEE IF I CAN HOOK UP WITH THE ONE

44:14.452 --> 44:15.952
WITH THE FAT LITTLE LEGS,
BUT...

44:15.954 --> 44:19.622
YOU KNOW, SHE'S FRENCH-KISSING
ON THE FLOOR WITH SOMEBODY

44:19.624 --> 44:23.192
THAT... I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.801
THEN YESTERDAY WAS SUNDAY,
SO NO PARTIES

44:31.803 --> 44:36.472
AND NO CHANCE OF GETTING PUS
BECAUSE EVERYONE'S AT CHURCH.

44:38.276 --> 44:41.144
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

44:42.046 --> 44:45.548
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
PLENTY OF OTHER WEEKENDS.

44:45.550 --> 44:48.384
YEAH.

44:48.519 --> 44:51.087
MAGGIE JOHNSTON SOUNDS
A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED.

44:51.089 --> 44:55.825
YOU SHOULDN'T LET THESE
GIRLS MESS WITH YOUR HEAD.

44:57.729 --> 45:00.396
YEAH, I KNOW.

45:06.070 --> 45:09.639
I'M PRETTY OPTIMISTIC
ABOUT NEXT WEEKEND, THOUGH.

45:09.641 --> 45:12.008
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH.

45:12.010 --> 45:14.610
I'M GOING TO THIS
REGIONAL BEAUTY PAGEANT.

45:14.612 --> 45:16.946
IT'S LIKE MISS AMERICA,
BUT-

45:16.948 --> 45:19.549
WAY BEFORE MISS AMERICA, BUT
THAT KIND OF THING, YOU KNOW.

45:19.551 --> 45:23.720
IT'S, LIKE, FOR GIRLS WHO...
MIGHT WANT TO BE MISS AMERICA

45:23.722 --> 45:27.190
AND MIGHT BE
MISS AMERICA LATER.

45:27.192 --> 45:29.258
OH, WHOA.

45:29.260 --> 45:31.728
FEELING PRETTY GOOD
ABOUT YOUR CHANCES?

45:31.730 --> 45:37.200
YEAH. I'VE GOT, LIKE, AN 80% TO
90% SUCCESS RATE AT THESE THINGS.

45:37.202 --> 45:42.939
A LOT OF THE WOMEN GET THEIR HORMONES
IN A TIZZY AT COMPETITIVE EVENTS AND...

45:42.941 --> 45:45.308
WHEN YOU GET A...

45:45.310 --> 45:49.979
WELL, THEN, EVEN THE LOSERS
ARE LIKE WINNERS TO ME.

45:49.981 --> 45:52.782
IT'S REALLY COOL.

45:53.450 --> 45:55.551
WHY, SOMEHOW, IN YOUR MIND, YOU TRULY DO

45:55.553 --> 45:59.021
PERCEIVE YOURSELF AS
A GENTLEMAN, DON'T YOU?

45:59.023 --> 46:01.524
HUH?

46:59.850 --> 47:03.152
SURE YOU DON'T WANT
ANY HOT FISH?

47:03.154 --> 47:04.420
NO.

47:04.422 --> 47:05.955
MY STOMACH FEELS
FUNNY.

47:05.957 --> 47:08.891
THINK I'M STILL HUNG-OVER
FROM THE WEEKEND.

47:08.893 --> 47:10.693
DID YOU TAKE AN ANTACID?

47:10.695 --> 47:13.329
AHEM. YEAH.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.801
EVERYTHING OK?

47:18.803 --> 47:19.902
YEAH.

47:19.904 --> 47:23.206
REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE
BEING OUT HERE RIGHT NOW.

47:23.208 --> 47:26.242
AND I DON'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE, BUT...

47:26.244 --> 47:30.146
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE SOCIALIZATIONS.

47:31.048 --> 47:32.048
YOU KNOW WHAT?

47:32.050 --> 47:34.417
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
MY ROD AND REEL, GO OUT,

47:34.419 --> 47:37.320
SEE IF YOU CAN'T CATCH US
A COUPLE OF FISH?

47:37.322 --> 47:38.387
NAW.

47:38.389 --> 47:40.957
NO, DO IT.
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

47:40.959 --> 47:44.060
I PROMISE, IT'S GOOD
FOR THE SOUL.

47:44.062 --> 47:45.795
NAH.
DO IT.

47:45.797 --> 47:48.097
YOU CAN BORROW MY ROD,
MY REEL, MY NET.

47:48.099 --> 47:51.968
YOU CAN BORROW MY WADERS,
BORROW MY SWIM TRUNKS.

47:51.970 --> 47:53.469
OH, REALLY?
YEAH.

47:53.471 --> 47:54.437
OK.

47:54.439 --> 47:55.705
WHAT'S THIS?

47:55.707 --> 47:57.440
OH, I FORGOT.
THAT'S YOUR MAIL.

47:57.442 --> 47:59.542
YOU GOT A LETTER
FROM MADISON.

47:59.544 --> 48:00.276
WHAT?

48:00.278 --> 48:03.346
YEAH, l-I PUT IT
IN YOUR BAG.

48:05.415 --> 48:07.750
AREN'T YOU GONNA
TAKE THE ROD?

48:07.752 --> 48:10.519
NO, THAT'S OK.

49:39.710 --> 49:41.277
AAH! OH!

49:54.725 --> 49:58.227
ALVIN?

50:00.297 --> 50:04.633
ALVIN!

50:40.170 --> 50:42.705
ALVIN?

52:43.026 --> 52:44.760
HEY, BUDDY.

52:44.762 --> 52:45.628
HEY.

52:45.630 --> 52:47.763
GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE
STILL HERE.

52:47.765 --> 52:50.032
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU GUYS.

52:50.034 --> 52:51.667
COOL.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.569
DAMN TRUCK
BROKE DOWN.

52:53.571 --> 52:56.038
HALLELUJAH DONE
QUIT ON ME.

52:56.040 --> 52:58.607
BAD DAY.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.477
GET OUT OF HERE.

53:03.014 --> 53:04.647
HERE YOU GO.

53:04.649 --> 53:06.248
OH, THANKS.

53:06.250 --> 53:07.550
WELL, ANY IDEA

53:07.552 --> 53:10.553
HOW MANY LINES YOU PAINTED DOWN THERE?

53:10.555 --> 53:12.421
OH. WELL, I HAVE NO IDEA.

53:12.423 --> 53:14.723
YOU COVERED THE WHOLE ASPHALT SECTION

53:14.725 --> 53:16.425
TILL THE GRAVEL
BEGINS.

53:16.427 --> 53:18.494
THAT'S 8.2 MILES.

53:18.496 --> 53:20.029
AND THAT'S
AN AVERAGE

53:20.031 --> 53:22.865
OF 4.6 METERS
BETWEEN EACH LINE

53:22.867 --> 53:27.770
AND ABOUT 5 METERS LONG ON EACH LINE.

53:27.772 --> 53:31.607
NOW, HOW MUCH
THAT MAKE?

53:31.609 --> 53:33.342
I HAVE NO IDEA.

53:33.344 --> 53:35.611
YOU MEAN YOU
DON'T KNOW?

53:35.613 --> 53:36.979
WELL, HOLD ON.

53:36.981 --> 53:40.316
HOW MANY MILES
DID YOU SAY?

53:40.318 --> 53:42.751
8.2.

53:42.753 --> 53:46.188
8.2

53:46.190 --> 53:49.191
DIVIDED BY 4.6.

53:49.193 --> 53:51.860
YOU SAID THERE'S A
THOUSAND METERS IN A MILE.

53:51.862 --> 53:55.831
OR, NO, NO. A THOUSAND-
A THOUSAND FEET IN A METER.

53:56.533 --> 54:01.704
I HAVE 854.888.

54:01.706 --> 54:03.906
THAT'S AMAZING.

54:03.908 --> 54:07.376
AND I CALCULATE 855.
THAT'S AMAZING!

54:07.378 --> 54:10.546
DRINK UP!
THAT IS REAL GOOD.

54:10.548 --> 54:13.449
SO, WHERE WAS
THAT LADY GOING?

54:13.451 --> 54:18.687
THE LADY THAT GOT OUT
OF YOUR TRUCK A SECOND AGO.

54:19.522 --> 54:21.423
WELL, NOW,
LOOK HERE, BUDDY,

54:21.425 --> 54:23.993
IF THERE'D HAVE BEEN
A LADY IN MY TRUCK,

54:23.995 --> 54:27.696
I'D HOLD ON TIGHT.
I WOULDN'T LET HER GO.

54:27.698 --> 54:30.666
NO LADY IN MY TRUCK.

54:31.034 --> 54:33.302
MMM.
WHAT'S UP?

54:33.304 --> 54:35.871
WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND?

54:35.873 --> 54:38.974
HE SORTA GOT A LETTER
FROM HIS GIRLFRIEND.

54:38.976 --> 54:40.709
SHE DUMPED HIM.

54:40.711 --> 54:42.378
OH, MAN.

54:42.380 --> 54:44.079
WHY?

54:44.081 --> 54:45.914
SHE'S ACTUALLY...

54:45.916 --> 54:47.883
SHE'S ACTUALLY
MY SISTER.

54:47.885 --> 54:50.586
YOUR SISTER'S HIS GIRLFRIEND? YEAH.

54:50.588 --> 54:52.688
PROBABLY
EX-GIRLFRIEND NOW.

54:52.690 --> 54:53.822
WHAT KIND OF FRIEND
ARE YOU?

54:53.824 --> 54:56.058
HE'S IN TROUBLE AND YOU'RE
SITTING HERE DRINKING?

54:56.060 --> 54:58.193
L- I MEAN, I THOUGHT
HE WAS- JESUS CHRIST.

54:58.195 --> 54:59.461
I THOUGHT I HAD
TROUBLES.

54:59.463 --> 55:02.398
YOU'RE HOPELESS AS TITS ON A BOAR HOG.

55:02.400 --> 55:05.634
IF YOU EVER-
SEE THAT. CHEERS.

55:05.636 --> 55:06.902
YOU MARRIED?

55:06.904 --> 55:09.004
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND? NO.

55:09.006 --> 55:10.806
WELL,
LET ME GIVE YOU

55:10.808 --> 55:12.207
NEVER SLEEP WITH
THE SAME WOMAN

55:12.209 --> 55:16.445
MORE THAN 3 TIMES IN A ROW
NO MATTER HOW GOOD IT IS.

55:16.447 --> 55:17.946
OTHERWISE,

55:17.948 --> 55:21.984
YOU START TO DEVELOP
FEELINGS.

55:21.986 --> 55:24.253
FEELINGS.

55:24.255 --> 55:28.324
THAT'S...
HOW YOU FEEL.

55:28.326 --> 55:32.394
UH-HUH. OH, CHECK IT
OUT. HERE HE COMES.

55:32.396 --> 55:35.564
YOU KNOW WHAT?

55:36.299 --> 55:37.733
I GOT TO GET OUT
OF HERE.

55:37.735 --> 55:41.603
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN
LISTENING TO SOME GROWN MAN CRY,

55:41.605 --> 55:45.541
SO, UH, I'M GONNA
LEAVE THIS WITH YOU,

55:45.543 --> 55:47.576
AND, UH... YEAH.

55:47.578 --> 55:51.413
THIS'LL GET YOU THROUGH
THE TOUGHEST PART.

55:51.415 --> 55:54.383
I'LL SEE YOU DOWN
THE ROAD.

55:54.385 --> 55:57.519
LIKE THE SHOES.

56:06.963 --> 56:09.998
HALLELUJAH!

56:14.204 --> 56:18.374
YOU KNOW THAT PAINT
IS POISONOUS, RIGHT?

56:53.543 --> 56:56.278
IS EVERYTHING OK?

56:59.717 --> 57:05.921
IT'S JUST... YOU WERE GONE
WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING.

57:06.956 --> 57:10.559
I HAD TO MAKE
A PHONE CALL.

57:11.127 --> 57:14.830
OH, YOU DROVE ALL
THE WAY TO TOWN?

57:24.140 --> 57:26.909
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

57:26.911 --> 57:30.946
WHAT WOULD I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

57:34.585 --> 57:40.155
I JUST HAD A FEELING YOU MIGHT
WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING.

58:03.880 --> 58:07.616
YOU GONNA HIT IT IN
WITH YOUR HAND?

58:15.058 --> 58:19.161
YOU KNOW... SOMETIMES IT'S
JUST BETTER TO TALK ABOUT IT-

58:19.163 --> 58:23.332
YOU KNOW, COULD WE JUST ENJOY
THE SILENCE A LITTLE BIT?

58:23.334 --> 58:27.503
I JUST THINK SOMETIMES IT'S
JUST-IT'S BETTER TO TALK ABOUT STUFF.

58:27.505 --> 58:30.639
THEN WHY DON'T YOU BE
SELF-SUFFICIENT FOR ONCE, HUH?

58:30.641 --> 58:32.674
DO I HAVE TO KEEP YOU
ENTERTAINED ALL THE TIME?

58:32.676 --> 58:35.477
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE TAKE THIS
JOB 'CAUSE THEY WANT A LITTLE PEACE.

58:35.479 --> 58:39.414
SOME PEOPLE DO THIS JOB BECAUSE
THEY WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE.

58:39.416 --> 58:42.251
JUST TRYING TO BE NICE.

58:43.119 --> 58:45.821
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
WITH MADISON?

58:45.823 --> 58:48.991
OH, MAN.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER?

58:48.993 --> 58:50.492
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST...

58:50.494 --> 58:53.328
THOUGHT MAYBE YOU GOT
SOME BAD NEWS OR SOMETHING.

58:53.330 --> 58:54.763
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU, HUH?

58:54.765 --> 58:56.532
YOU'RE JUST LIKE HER!
"WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

58:56.534 --> 58:59.167
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? WHAT'S
WRONG? WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE?"

58:59.169 --> 59:01.837
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
SHE DUMPED YOU.

59:01.839 --> 59:03.272
WHAT?

59:03.274 --> 59:05.541
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

59:05.543 --> 59:07.442
I DON'T KNOW. L-
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

59:07.444 --> 59:08.810
HAVE YOU BEEN POKING
AROUND IN MY LETTERS?

59:08.812 --> 59:11.547
DID YOU OPEN MY MANILA
ENVELOPE? DID YOU READ MY MAIL?

59:11.549 --> 59:14.983
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT
IS WRONG WITH THIS FAMILY?

59:14.985 --> 59:17.920
MY GOD, THIS FAMILY!
THIS FAMILY!

59:17.922 --> 59:19.454
YOU ARE A WEAK PEOPLE!

59:19.456 --> 59:22.424
YOU ARE A WEAK, FEEBLE,
FLIMSY, TENUOUS PEOPLE

59:22.426 --> 59:25.160
WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE
ALONE FOR 5 MINUTES,

59:25.162 --> 59:27.930
REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH
THEY'RE LOVED!

59:27.932 --> 59:31.333
HOW DID YOU LIVE YOUR
LIFE UP TO THIS POINT

59:31.335 --> 59:34.269
WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO
GUT A FISH OR BUILD A TENT

59:34.271 --> 59:36.905
OR TIE A KNOT OR MINDING
YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

59:36.907 --> 59:39.041
THEN HOW DID YOU LIVE THIS
LONG AND NOT KILL YOURSELF

59:39.043 --> 59:43.579
FOR BEING SUCH A BORING LOSER WHO THINKS
HE'S SO SMART AND GOOD AT EVERYTHING?

59:43.581 --> 59:46.114
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
YOU'RE NOT!

59:46.116 --> 59:47.783
YOU SUCK, AND THAT'S
WHY SHE LEFT YOU!

59:47.785 --> 59:50.786
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ALWAYS LEAVING TOWN,
YOU'RE ALWAYS STRUGGLING WITH YOURSELF!

59:50.788 --> 59:55.190
SHE WANTED A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP
AND SHE SAW RIGHT THROUGH YOU!

59:55.192 --> 59:57.826
YOU BLEW IT!

01:00:51.447 --> 01:00:54.583
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
PAID TODAY.

01:00:54.585 --> 01:00:55.817
LET GO!

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.053
COME ON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:00:58.055 --> 01:00:59.955
GET OFF ME, JERK!

01:00:59.957 --> 01:01:03.225
OW! AH!

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:06.595
OW!

01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:29.251
- HELLO?
- HELLO?

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:31.286
HEY. DID YOU GET
MY LETTER?

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:32.854
NOW, IS IT TRUE?
I CAN'T-IS IT-

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:35.891
WHAT YOU WROTE. IS THAT TRUE?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, ALVIN?

01:01:35.893 --> 01:01:39.261
IT'S WHAT IT
- YOU KNOW, IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THAT.

01:01:39.263 --> 01:01:44.199
I NEED SOMEONE THAT WANTS TO BE WITH ME, THAT IS
- I DO!

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.001
BUT WHO'S HERE.

01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:46.902
I AM!

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:48.537
YOU'RE ALWAYS LEAVING.

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:49.771
THIS IS MY LIFE,
BABY.

01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:51.773
I DO THIS FOR US, FOR
US TO SAVE. I KNOW.

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:55.110
FOR US TO SAVE AND TO RUN AWAY.
I KNOW, BUT I NEED SOMETHING ELSE.

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:57.879
LOOK, I CAN'T ASK YOU
TO CHANGE. I CAN'T.

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:00.782
YES, YOU CAN. YOU CAN ASK ME TO CHANGE.

01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:02.718
YOU DON'T,
BUT YOU DO.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.553
CLEARLY, YOU DO
WANT ME TO CHANGE.

01:02:04.555 --> 01:02:06.221
AND I WILL.
YOU DON'T EVEN ASK.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.190
YOU JUST ASSUME
THAT I WON'T.

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:09.624
YOU ASSUME
ALL THESE THINGS.

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:11.359
YOU DON'T EVEN ASK.
YOU HAVE TO ASK.

01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:13.095
YOU JUST ASSUME...
...WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

01:02:13.097 --> 01:02:15.564
YOU ASSUME THAT I'M SET
IN MY WAYS, I HAVE MY LIFE,

01:02:15.566 --> 01:02:17.599
AND EVERYTHING IS LIKE
IT IS, BUT IT IS NOT.

01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:20.802
EVERYTHING I DO IS FOR US,
WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY,

01:02:20.804 --> 01:02:22.904
WHATEVER MAKES US HAPPY.

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:27.676
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I NEVER
HEARD YOU SAY THAT. I DIDN'T KNOW.

01:02:27.678 --> 01:02:29.411
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S NOT THAT.

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:31.113
IT'S 'CAUSE YOU ALWAYS
WANT TO BE IN CONTROL.

01:02:31.115 --> 01:02:32.647
THAT'S WHAT IT IS,
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID.

01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:36.051
DEEP DOWN, YOU ARE AFRAID, YOU
DON'T WANT TO BE VULNERABLE.

01:02:36.053 --> 01:02:39.054
LISTEN TO ME.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:41.323
I'M SORRY, ALVIN.

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:44.960
THIS GUY, IS HE WHO
YOU WANT TO BE WITH?

01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:46.194
IT'S SERIOUS.

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:49.965
YOU DON'T WANT
TO GIVE US A CHANCE?

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:54.536
I CAN'T LIVE WITH YOU.

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.938
I LOVE YOU.
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.406
I'M WHAT?

01:02:58.408 --> 01:03:00.342
YOU'RE KILLING ME!

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:02.744
STOP!

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:35.043
LANCE, LET'S GO.

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:39.447
COME ON, WE GOT WORK
TO DO. LET'S GO.

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:43.218
HEY, OPEN THE DOOR.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.553
NO WAY, ALVIN.
I'M ON STRIKE.

01:03:44.555 --> 01:03:47.489
OPEN THE DOOR! WE'VE
GOT WORK TO DO! LET'S GO!

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:52.494
I SAID I'M ON STRIKE BECAUSE
YOU'RE BEING A CRAZY PERSON.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:54.362
LET'S GO!

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:17.118
DO YOU KNOW THE ONLY REASON
THAT YOU HAVE THIS JOB

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.021
IS BECAUSE I WAS BEING
NICE TO YOUR SISTER?

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:24.359
I WAS BEING NICE AND I WAS
GIVING YOU THE OPPORTUNITY

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.295
TO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER
AND STRAIGHTEN UP.

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:31.499
YOU QUIT ACTING SO IMMATURE,
LEARN A LITTLE DISCIPLINE.

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.635
BUT I DON'T HAVE TO
BE NICE TO YOU ANYMORE

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:35.270
BECAUSE I AM NOT LOVED
BY YOUR SISTER.

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:38.773
SHE DOESN'T LOVE ME, SO
I DON'T HAVE TO LOVE YOU.

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:42.577
I COULD CALL THE BOSS RIGHT
NOW AND HAVE YOU FIRED.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:44.579
DON'T THREATEN ME.

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:48.149
YOU THINK YOU'RE SO
TOUGH! I COULD BEAT YOU UP.

01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:51.586
YOU CAN'T BEAT ME UP.
OH, YOU WANT TO BET?

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:00.562
LOOK AT YOU,

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:02.163
CALLING ME IMMATURE.

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:04.699
YOU'RE JUST A WORTHLESS SACK OF CRAP.

01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:06.902
OH, YEAH? WELL, AT LEAST
I DON'T GO AROUND THINKING

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:10.538
I'M A GREAT DANCER WHEN I
ACTUALLY STINK AT DANCING.

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.173
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN
SEEN ME DANCE.

01:05:12.175 --> 01:05:17.345
I'VE SEEN YOU DO A LOT OF THINGS
WHEN YOU DON'T THINK I'M WATCHING.

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:22.517
YOU'RE THE WORST
PERSON IN THE WORLD.

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:53.381
YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!

01:05:57.186 --> 01:06:01.389
YOU'RE THE WORST PERSON
IN THE WORLD!

01:06:16.373 --> 01:06:18.373
LANCE!

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:20.642
HELP!

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:22.243
ALVIN?

01:06:22.245 --> 01:06:23.645
HELP!

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:25.613
ALVIN?

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:27.282
ALVIN.

01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:29.784
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU OK?

01:06:29.786 --> 01:06:31.987
OH, YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT.
I JUST...

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:33.355
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:35.423
OH, I NAILED
MY HIPS.

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:36.458
WHAT?

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.226
YEAH, I THINK l-

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:40.228
I THINK I MESSED UP
MY HIPS.

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:42.564
DID YOU FALL OFF
THIS CLIFF?

01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:43.398
YEAH.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.367
ARE YOU PULLING
MY LEGS?

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:48.570
ARE THERE SNAKES DOWN
THERE? I DON'T KNOW.

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:50.672
ARE THERE SNAKES
DOWN THERE?

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.941
I HAVE NO IDEA!
MAYBE!

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:57.012
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

01:06:57.014 --> 01:07:00.949
THERE'S MOSS.
CAREFUL.

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:05.954
GOOD JOB.

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:09.591
WHY'D YOU FALL OFF
A CLIFF?

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:13.028
I DIDN'T.

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:17.332
I JUMPED.

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:22.937
WILL YOU HELP ME?

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:26.074
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING.

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:27.642
I FEEL LIKE A FOOL.

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:29.744
I WAS RUNNING AND THEN
I REACHED THE CLIFF,

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:34.215
AND ALL I KNOW IS I WANTED
TO EITHER FLY OR KILL MYSELF.

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:37.352
KILL YOURSELF BY JUMPING
OFF A 12-FOOT CLIFF?

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:42.190
SOMETIMES I CAN DO THINGS
THAT CAN'T REALLY HAPPEN.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.060
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:47.829
I'M IMPOSSIBLE.

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:52.467
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET YOUR HIPS
TO THE HOSPITAL TO GET A CHECKUP.

01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:53.568
MY HIPS ARE FINE.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:58.640
IT WAS JUST THE SHOCK
WHEN I LANDED BECAUSE...

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:01.276
I DID FLY FOR 7 SECONDS.

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:04.679
I WAS FLYING AND THEN
I... LANDED ON MY SIDE.

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:10.819
BUT MY HIP ISN'T BROKEN. IT'S JUST
BRUISED AND BEAT UP AND... STUPID

01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:13.888
AND OLD LIKE ME.

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:16.524
STUPID HIP.

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:18.926
WHAT'S ON YOUR FACE?

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:22.964
OH. IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE WAR PAINT.

01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:25.533
HEH HEH!

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:30.839
SORRY ABOUT YOUR WATCH.

01:08:30.841 --> 01:08:33.707
I SHOULDN'T HAVE CRUSHED
IT. IT WAS REALLY COOL.

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:38.246
I'D ALSO LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE WAY I SPOKE TO YOU.

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:40.881
I HAD NO RIGHT
TO INSULT YOU LIKE THAT.

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:42.850
YEAH. YEAH, IT'S NOT
SUCH A BIG DEAL.

01:08:42.853 --> 01:08:46.754
YOU KNOW, WE WERE JUST BEING JERKS,
TRYING TO HURT EACH OTHER'S FEELINGS.

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:51.024
I READ IN A PAMPHLET BACK WHEN
I WAS IN SCHOOL THAT SOMETIMES,

01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:54.962
WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING UGLY
TO SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW,

01:08:54.965 --> 01:09:00.535
YOU'RE REALLY JUST TRYING TO BUILD YOUR
OWN SELF UP LIKE-LIKE YOU'RE SPECIAL.

01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:03.671
SO WHEN YOU SAY
SOMETHING NEGATIVE

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:05.974
AND INSULT
THE OTHER PERSON...

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:09.109
YOU'RE REALLY JUST SHOWING
THAT OTHER PERSON

01:09:09.112 --> 01:09:16.917
WHAT AN UNSURE-OF-YOURSELF- TYPE PERSON
THAT YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU ARE.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.553
I KNOW.

01:09:18.555 --> 01:09:21.756
I READ THAT
PAMPHLET, TOO.

01:09:24.094 --> 01:09:27.060
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
THAT THIS...

01:09:27.063 --> 01:09:29.930
JOB WOULD BE GOOD
FOR ME TO THINK

01:09:29.933 --> 01:09:32.767
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP
I HAVE WITH MADISON.

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:36.437
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I
COULD LEARN TO DO BETTER,

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:38.573
THAT I COULD FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO BE HAPPY

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:41.341
WITH MY LIFE AND STILL
GIVE HER WHAT SHE NEEDS.

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:42.977
BUT THE DISTANCE APART

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:46.781
GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY
TO... GET SCARED

01:09:46.783 --> 01:09:49.783
OR JUST...

01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:52.386
DISAPPEAR.

01:09:53.788 --> 01:09:57.225
SO IS IT REALLY OVER?

01:09:57.526 --> 01:10:01.596
SEEMS PRETTY BLACK
AND WHITE TO ME.

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:44.806
THERE'S ANOTHER GUY.

01:10:44.808 --> 01:10:47.075
I TALKED TO HER
ON THE PHONE.

01:10:47.077 --> 01:10:49.677
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:52.213
IS HE A FOREIGNER?

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:54.482
IS HE
THAT MEXICAN GUY?

01:10:54.484 --> 01:10:56.117
WAIT. WHAT?

01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:57.352
NEVER MIND.

01:10:57.354 --> 01:11:00.288
THIS GUY IS HALF
NATIVE AMERICAN.

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:02.790
HE GOES BY B.B.

01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:03.725
B.B.?
YEAH.

01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:05.560
CALLS HIMSELF
BUSTER BROWN,

01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:07.328
YOU KNOW, LIKE
IN BUSTER BROWN?

01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:10.064
HE'S HALF NATIVE AMERICAN, HALF ITALIAN.

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:12.300
WHOA. PRETTY EXOTIC.

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:13.501
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:18.473
SHE TALKS ABOUT HIM ALL THE
TIME. I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T...

01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:20.775
GOD, I COULD SEE
HIS FACE.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:23.344
SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT SHE DESERVES.

01:11:23.346 --> 01:11:27.782
ME. SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA
WAKE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:29.817
AND FEED THE CHICKENS
WITH HER,

01:11:29.819 --> 01:11:31.619
WHO'LL PROOFREAD
HER POETRY

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.921
OR SIT IN THAT OLD CHAIR
THAT HER MOM MADE.

01:11:33.923 --> 01:11:38.159
I BET YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY
THAT DOES THAT. NO ONE ELSE.

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:40.628
YOU THINK?
NO ONE ELSE!

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.530
I BET THIS NEW GUY
REALLY SUCKS.

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:44.165
YOU KNOW, I BET HE
HARDLY EVEN EXISTS.

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:49.971
YOU KNOW, SHE'S JUST SCARED
AND HE'S SAFE AND THAT'S IT.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.341
I LOVE HER.

01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:55.510
THAT PART SUCKS.

01:11:55.512 --> 01:11:57.679
HA HA!

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.448
WERE THEY FRIENDS?

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:01.549
NO.

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:04.052
HE WAS HER CHIROPRACTOR.

01:12:04.054 --> 01:12:05.586
A WHAT?

01:12:05.588 --> 01:12:06.587
CHIROPRACTOR.

01:12:06.589 --> 01:12:07.889
WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S THAT?

01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:10.091
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
A CHIROPRAC-

01:12:10.093 --> 01:12:11.259
I KNOW, BUT JUST
REMIND ME?

01:12:11.261 --> 01:12:14.629
IT'S A GUY WHO SPECIALIZES
IN THE TREATMENT

01:12:14.631 --> 01:12:18.366
AND DISORDER
OF THE... SKELETON.

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:20.535
IT'S LIKE
A MASSEUSE.

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:21.436
SKELETONS?

01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:24.372
SHE USED TO GO IN
TO SEE TO HER NECK.

01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:29.010
SHE'S HOOKING UP
WITH A MASSEUSE.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:31.713
GROSS, MADISON.

01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:34.749
DISGUSTING.

01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:50.832
THE TRUCK DRIVER
GAVE US THIS.

01:12:50.834 --> 01:12:52.033
WHAT?

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:57.038
HE SAID IT'D HELP YOU GET
THROUGH THE TOUGHEST PART.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.874
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I TOLD
HIM HOW MUCH YOU LIKED IT,

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.576
SO HE GAVE US A WHOLE CASE.

01:13:01.578 --> 01:13:03.745
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME, DID YOU?

01:13:03.747 --> 01:13:07.181
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT IT? NO.

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:08.816
NO, I TOLD HIM
THAT YOU WERE A PRINCE

01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:13.554
THAT HAD BEEN... BANISHED FROM HIS
KINGDOM AND THAT YOU WERE FORCED

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:18.526
TO WORK OUT ON THE ROADS
WITH AN OLD PEASANT LIKE ME.

01:13:18.528 --> 01:13:23.030
GO... BACK
TO YOUR OLD CASTLE.

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:24.265
OH.

01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:26.801
FART.

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:30.838
JUST GET DRUNK
FOR 3 MONTHS.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.006
MAYBE MORE.

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:37.111
MAYBE SOMEDAY YOU CAN GET
HER BACK. I DON'T KNOW.

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:40.648
I ALSO HAD A TOUGH WEEKEND
LAST WEEKEND.

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:43.050
WHY, 'CAUSE YOU
DIDN'T GET LAID?

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:45.953
CATHY'S PREGNANT.

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:47.255
WHAT?

01:13:47.257 --> 01:13:50.291
CATHY CROSBY.

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:53.194
WHO'S CATHY CROSBY?

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:02.437
SHE'S 47.

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:06.974
SHE'S AN OLDER LADY I
SLEPT WITH 2 OR 3 TIMES.

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:09.744
IT WAS NOTHING SPECIAL.

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:11.946
MOM GAVE ME
A POST-IT ON SATURDAY

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:14.782
AND TOLD ME I HAD
TO CALL CATHY...

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.451
BUT I DIDN'T BOTHER.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:19.053
THEN AFTER THE BEAT-UPS ON SATURDAY
NIGHT, I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE GOOD

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:21.489
TO GET AT LEAST A LITTLE
SOMETHING, AND SO I CALLED HER.

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:25.059
AND THEN I GO OVER TO HER PLACE
AND SHE'S ALL DRAMATIC AND SAYS

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:27.795
THERE'S NO CHANCE
OF GETTING IT ON

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.665
AND THAT SHE JUST
WANTS TO TALK.

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:32.500
AND I'M LIKE...

01:14:32.502 --> 01:14:36.070
"BORING. WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT?"

01:14:36.072 --> 01:14:39.307
AND THEN SHE STARTS
CRYING, FREAKING OUT,

01:14:39.309 --> 01:14:41.742
AND SHE TELLS ME
THAT SHE'S PREGNANT

01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:44.345
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

01:14:44.347 --> 01:14:46.981
AND I'M LIKE,
"WHAT? IS IT MINE?"

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:48.549
SHE TELLS ME
SHE HASN'T PARTIED

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:51.018
WITH ANYBODY ELSE FOR
THE LAST 6 MONTHS.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.987
SO I TELL HER THAT WE
CAN'T DO THIS, YOU KNOW,

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:54.455
SHE'S JUST GONNA HAVE
TO GET A LABORTION.

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:57.959
SHE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE
ABLE TO GET PREGNANT, YOU KNOW?

01:14:57.961 --> 01:15:00.261
SHE'S NOT FRESH ANYMORE.
SHE'S OLD.

01:15:00.263 --> 01:15:02.430
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:07.468
SO I TELL HER THAT SHE HAS TO
TAKE CARE OF THE BABY BY HERSELF

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.604
IF SHE WANTS TO KEEP IT.

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:12.373
DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:13.841
THIS IS...

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:15.643
A GIFT. THIS IS A...

01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:20.214
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A PERSON,

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:22.517
ESPECIALLY...

01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:24.318
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

01:15:25.288 --> 01:15:28.489
I'M NOT READY TO BE A DAD. WHO IS?

01:15:28.491 --> 01:15:31.659
NOBODY'S EVER READY.
YOU JUST-YOU JUST...

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:34.529
DO, YOU KNOW?
IT'S THE NEXT STEP.

01:15:34.531 --> 01:15:37.164
IT'S THE...

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:38.900
BECOME A DAD.

01:15:38.902 --> 01:15:40.902
DEAL WITH IT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:44.005
SOME THINGS ARE GONNA BE
STINKS, ALL RIGHT?

01:15:44.007 --> 01:15:51.178
BUT OTHER PARTS ARE GOING TO
BE THE GREATEST THINGS EVER.

01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:56.584
IT'S A MIRACLE.

01:15:56.852 --> 01:16:02.356
YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT MADISON
ALREADY HAD A KID WHEN YOU MET HER.

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:05.426
YOU SHOULD BE...
THANKFUL.

01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:08.029
MAYBE SO.

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:12.033
YOU'RE A FUNNY FISH.

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:17.972
1...

01:16:17.974 --> 01:16:19.974
2...

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:22.443
3.

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:29.450
1, 2, 3!

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:37.658

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:02.363
YES, IT MEANS
"TO GET TO KNOW YOU."

01:20:02.365 --> 01:20:05.266
2Q.

01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:09.270
2Q.

01:20:11.707 --> 01:20:15.075
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:26.487
- HOW ARE YOU?

01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:30.157
NOW YOU SAY,
"HOW GOES IT, YOU?"

01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:37.264
HOW ARE YOU?

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:45.840
HOW ARE YOU?

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:10.798
ALVIN?

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.435
ALVIN?

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:24.612
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I SHOULD HAVE THIS BABY?

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:29.316
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:31.051
I WAS JUST...

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:37.625
THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT IT BEING A MIRACLE AND ALL.

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:47.301
MAYBE IT'S UNFAIR
TO MAKE HER GIVE IT UP

01:21:47.303 --> 01:21:52.006
WHEN IT'S DIFFICULT FOR HER TO
GET PREGNANT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:55.609
HMM.

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:59.380
MAYBE I'LL CALL HER
TOMORROW,

01:21:59.382 --> 01:22:03.817
TELL HER WE CAN DO
WHATEVER SHE WANTS AND...

01:22:03.819 --> 01:22:06.053
NOW THAT I GOT THIS
COOL JOB WORKING FOR YOU,

01:22:06.055 --> 01:22:09.123
I CAN SUPPORT
WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:11.725
GOOD IDEA.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.061
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DO
WHATEVER SHE WANTS ANYWAY,

01:22:14.063 --> 01:22:17.431
BUT THAT'S A GOOD-PERSON THING TO DO.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:21.335
YOU SHOULD
SUPPORT THAT.

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:28.809
YOU'RE NOT THE IDIOT
SOME PEOPLE THINK YOU ARE.

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:35.916
LANCE?

01:22:35.918 --> 01:22:41.155
ARE YOU STILL GOING TO THE
BEAUTY SHOW THIS WEEKEND?

01:22:41.157 --> 01:22:44.758
YOU MEAN THE REGIONAL
BEAUTY PAGEANT?

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.193
YEAH.

01:22:46.195 --> 01:22:49.530
YEAH. OF COURSE.

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:53.133
I KNOW I'M NOT
A FUN PERSON, BUT

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:55.736
DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD BE

01:22:55.738 --> 01:22:58.372
ALL RIGHT
IF I WENT WITH YOU?

01:22:58.374 --> 01:23:00.574
DO YOU LIKE
BEAUTY PAGEANTS?

01:23:00.576 --> 01:23:03.844
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO ONE.

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:08.515
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO BE BY MYSELF

01:23:08.517 --> 01:23:10.451
THIS WEEKEND.

01:23:10.453 --> 01:23:14.188
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

01:23:15.056 --> 01:23:18.592
IT'LL BE AN ADVENTURE.

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:23.998
HEY, MAYBE THEY'LL EVEN MAKE
A COMIC BOOK ABOUT US SOMEDAY...

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.103
"THE ADVENTURES
OF ALVIN AND LANCE."

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:34.742
"ALVIN AND LANCE."
HEH!

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:38.812
WE JUST NEED TO GET YOU
LAID BY A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

01:23:38.814 --> 01:23:40.848
I JUST WANT TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:43.884
YEAH. PARTYING WITH
A FUTURE MISS AMERICA

01:23:43.886 --> 01:23:46.954
SOUNDS LIKE A HECK OF
A GOOD TIME TO ME.

01:23:46.956 --> 01:23:51.125
I EVEN KNOW SOME
OF THE CONTESTANTS.

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:56.830
WHO KNOWS?

01:23:56.832 --> 01:24:04.671
MAYBE THEY'LL EVEN WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH A COUPLE OF OLD FATTIES LIKE US.

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:07.341
HEY, ALVIN?

01:24:07.343 --> 01:24:10.310
IF YOU WERE IN
A REGIONAL BEAUTY PAGEANT

01:24:10.312 --> 01:24:13.247
AND YOU WERE A GIRL...

01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:17.084
WHAT WOULD YOUR
SPECIAL TALENT BE?

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:20.587
TRIPLE JUMP.

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:22.456
HUH?

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:24.258
TRIPLE JUMP.

01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:26.360
WHAT'S TRIPLE JUMP?

01:24:26.362 --> 01:24:29.496
IT'S 3 JUMPS.

01:24:29.498 --> 01:24:32.699
OH, YEAH.

01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:39.606
GOOD NIGHT.

01:24:39.608 --> 01:24:42.476
Good night.

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.836
GET ON IT.

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:17.804
HEY, ALVIN.
WHAT?

01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:20.574
REMEMBER THAT CASH YOU
ASKED ME TO GIVE MADISON

01:26:20.576 --> 01:26:23.277
FROM LAST WEEK?
YEAH.

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:26.079
WELL, I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

01:26:26.081 --> 01:26:27.381
I...

01:26:27.383 --> 01:26:29.917
SORT OF FORGOT TO
SEND IT TO HER.

01:26:29.919 --> 01:26:31.985
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU.
I WAS JUST-

01:26:31.987 --> 01:26:33.787
YOU KNOW, I WAS REALLY
AFRAID YOU WERE

01:26:33.789 --> 01:26:35.522
GONNA GET MAD AT ME.

01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:37.391
THAT'S GREAT!

01:26:37.393 --> 01:26:39.259
REALLY?
ABSOLUTELY.

01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:41.662
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:43.664
LET'S SPEND IT
THIS WEEKEND

01:26:43.666 --> 01:26:46.033
ON SOME LADIES
WHO DESERVE US.

01:26:46.035 --> 01:26:46.934
YEAH!

01:26:46.936 --> 01:26:49.169
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:26:49.171 --> 01:26:51.038
TAKE $40 OUT OF THERE.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.640
BUY YOURSELF
ANOTHER WATCH.

01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:56.877
I ALREADY DID.

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.481
WHOA. CHECK IT OUT.

01:27:01.483 --> 01:27:03.317
HITCHHIKER.

01:27:04.285 --> 01:27:07.321
HEY, I KNOW THAT WOMAN.

01:27:07.323 --> 01:27:08.388
I KNOW THAT-I KNOW-

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:13.427
HEY! EXCUSE ME.
DO YOU NEED A RIDE?

01:27:13.429 --> 01:27:15.562
HELLO?

01:27:24.372 --> 01:27:27.040
HELLO?

01:27:27.042 --> 01:27:29.776
EVERYTHING OK?

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:33.981
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T
SPEAK ENGLISH.

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.667
WELL, WELL, WELL! HEH!

01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:56.637

FIXING THE ROAD?

01:27:56.639 --> 01:27:58.405
UH, NO.
WE'RE JUST TAKING

01:27:58.407 --> 01:27:59.339
A FEW DAYS OFF.

01:27:59.341 --> 01:28:01.241
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
SOME FUN.

01:28:01.243 --> 01:28:02.309
YEAH? GOOD FOR YOU GUYS.

01:28:02.311 --> 01:28:04.845
GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU DESERVE IT. HA HA!

01:28:04.847 --> 01:28:07.848
HEY, THAT'S THE WOMAN

01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:10.717
THAT'S THE WOMAN THAT
GOT OUT OF YOUR TRUCK

01:28:10.719 --> 01:28:14.121
THE OTHER DAY.
THAT'S HER.

01:28:14.123 --> 01:28:15.389
WOMAN? WHAT WOMAN?

01:28:15.391 --> 01:28:17.224
THAT'S DEFINITELY
THE WOMAN THAT GOT

01:28:17.226 --> 01:28:18.158
OUT OF YOUR TRUCK.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.893
THERE'S NO WOMAN
IN MY TRUCK.

01:28:19.895 --> 01:28:21.795
THERE IS A WOMAN
IN YOUR TRUCK.

01:28:21.797 --> 01:28:23.196
THERE IS.
WHOA, WHOA...

01:28:23.198 --> 01:28:25.499
HEY, WHOA.
IF THERE WAS
