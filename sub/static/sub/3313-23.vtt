WEBVTT

00:07.888 --> 00:09.589
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.590 --> 00:11.511
CHARLOTTE, I REALLY
APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.842
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND.

00:12.843 --> 00:15.435
HONEST. OKAY, TALK LATER.

00:15.436 --> 00:16.726
BYE.

00:16.727 --> 00:19.599
WELL, I'M NEVER SEEING
THAT BITCH AGAIN.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.191
YOU JUST SAID YOU
APPRECIATED HER HONESTY.

00:21.192 --> 00:24.484
OBVIOUSLY I WAS LYING.

00:24.485 --> 00:27.987
HOW I FEEL AND WHAT I SAY
ISN'T ALWAYS RELATED.

00:27.988 --> 00:29.359
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.451
I JUST CALLED TO CONFIRM OUR
DINNER FOR THIS WEEKEND

00:31.452 --> 00:32.782
AND SHE SAID, GET THIS...

00:32.783 --> 00:34.033
THAT SHE'S NOT SURE

00:34.034 --> 00:36.116
THEY'RE GOING TO BE
HUNGRY THAT NIGHT.

00:36.117 --> 00:37.707
OKAY, IF SHE'S GOING
TO BLOW US OFF,

00:37.708 --> 00:39.038
SHE'D BETTER PUT A LITTLE MORE
EFFORT INTO IT THAN THAT.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.161
NO KIDDING. FINALLY SHE
TOLD ME THE TRUTH.

00:41.162 --> 00:43.002
THEY DON'T WANT TO HANG
OUT WITH US ANYMORE

00:43.003 --> 00:44.003
BECAUSE WE ARGUE TOO MUCH.

00:44.004 --> 00:46.216
- WE DO NOT ARGUE TOO MUCH.
- YES, WE DO!

00:46.217 --> 00:49.008
NO, WE DON'T. WHAT WE DO IS
WE DISAGREE WITH VOLUME.

00:49.009 --> 00:51.971
AND HAND GESTURES.

00:51.972 --> 00:54.724
WELL, CHARLOTTE SAID THAT
NOBODY CAN RELAX AROUND US

00:54.725 --> 00:56.176
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE
LOUD DISAGREEING.

00:56.177 --> 00:57.637
NOBODY CAN RELAX AROUND US?!

00:57.638 --> 00:59.979
THAT'S RIDIC... I AM
INSANELY RELAXING.

00:59.980 --> 01:02.642
I'M LIKE XANAX IN HUMAN FORM.

01:02.643 --> 01:04.184
WELL, YOU ARE A PILL.

01:04.185 --> 01:06.106
LOOK, I THINK IT'S
TIME WE FACE THE FACT

01:06.107 --> 01:07.947
- THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
- WE DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM, HONEY.

01:07.948 --> 01:09.028
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT YOU
THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

01:09.029 --> 01:10.610
SO YOU ADMIT WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

01:10.611 --> 01:12.902
WOW, YOU GUYS STARTED
EARLY TODAY.

01:12.903 --> 01:14.574
STARTED WHAT?

01:14.575 --> 01:17.407
ARGUING. I COULD HEAR YOU
OVER RYDER'S BATHROOM NOISES.

01:17.408 --> 01:19.659
SEE?

01:19.660 --> 01:21.751
OKAY, FINE, SO WE
ARGUE OCCASIONALLY.

01:21.752 --> 01:22.962
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

01:22.963 --> 01:24.334
LENNOX, YOU CAN
HANDLE THIS FOR US.

01:24.335 --> 01:25.835
YOU THINK YOUR AUNT
AND I ARGUE TOO MUCH?

01:25.836 --> 01:27.127
YES.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.879
- SHE'S TOTALLY RIGHT.
- SHE'S OBVIOUSLY WRONG.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.261

( whirring ceases )

01:53.494 --> 01:55.155
HEY, GREAT NEWS.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.367
THE AIR-CONDITIONING REPAIRMAN
IS COMING ON THURSDAY.

01:57.368 --> 02:00.079
- WHY?
- TO FIX THE AIR-CONDITIONING.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.871
HONEY, IT'S NOT BROKEN. YOU
JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO SET IT.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.913
- YES, I DO.
- NO, YOU DON'T. NO, NO.

02:03.914 --> 02:07.046
YOU CAN'T USE A HAMMER
TO SET THE TEMPERATURE.

02:07.047 --> 02:09.339
JOE, LOOK, IT NEEDS SOME WORK.

02:09.340 --> 02:10.630
AND SO DO WE.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.961
OH, JEEZ.

02:11.962 --> 02:13.553
IS THIS ABOUT THE WHOLE
ARGUING THING AGAIN...

02:13.554 --> 02:14.884
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
WE REALLY DO NOT DO.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.256
WE CAN'T GO MORE
THAN THREE SENTENCES

02:16.257 --> 02:17.557
WITHOUT CONTRADICTING
EACH OTHER.

02:17.558 --> 02:19.139
THAT'S...

02:20.221 --> 02:21.932
BUT...

02:23.564 --> 02:26.105
THAT'S A NEW DRESS, ISN'T IT?

02:26.106 --> 02:28.398
NO. LOOK, ALL OF MY GIRLFRIENDS

02:28.399 --> 02:30.610
THAT ARE IN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS
GO TO COUPLES' COUNSELING.

02:30.611 --> 02:31.821
I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY.

02:31.822 --> 02:33.032
OH, MY GOD.

02:33.033 --> 02:35.405
YOU WANT US TO GO TO THERAPY?

02:35.406 --> 02:38.828
LIKE I GOTTA CRY AND STUFF?

02:38.829 --> 02:40.910
EVERYONE CAN BENEFIT
FROM COUNSELING.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.242
YOU DON'T ONLY GO TO THE DENTIST
WHEN YOU HAVE A CAVITY.

02:42.243 --> 02:43.413
YOU GO FOR PREVENTION.

02:43.414 --> 02:45.455
MY DENTIST IS A SADIST.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.916
OKAY, BAD EXAMPLE.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.167
COUPLES' THERAPY IS SOMETHING

02:48.168 --> 02:49.168
YOU SHOULD DO FOR BETTER HEALTH.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.631
LIKE GETTING A COLONOSCOPY.

02:51.632 --> 02:55.174
YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO
SELL THIS, DON'T YOU?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.927
SO YOU DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
BOTHER IMPROVING OUR RELATIONSHIP?

02:57.928 --> 02:59.429
I DIDN'T SAY THAT. I JUST
DON'T THINK COUPLES' THERAPY

02:59.430 --> 03:01.261
IS A WORTHWHILE
INVESTMENT FOR US, OKAY?

03:01.262 --> 03:02.802
HONEY, YOU DON'T BRING
IN A THIRD PARTY

03:02.803 --> 03:04.183
TO HELP A COUPLE OUT
WITH THEIR PROBLEMS.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.766
THREE DOES NOT EQUAL TWO.
IT'S JUST MATH.

03:06.767 --> 03:08.228
MATH IS NEVER WRONG.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.439
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

03:09.440 --> 03:11.070
I THINK YOU'RE
RESISTANT TO THERAPY

03:11.071 --> 03:12.232
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT
OPEN TO NEW IDEAS.

03:12.233 --> 03:15.194
THAT'S NOT TRUE. I'M JUST
CLOSED TO BAD IDEAS.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.987
OKAY, FINE. I'M SURE YOU HAVE
LOTS OF INTERESTING IDEAS

03:17.988 --> 03:19.659
ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.371
- I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THEM.
- I WOULD LOVE TO SHARE THEM WITH YOU.

03:21.372 --> 03:23.082
- GREAT, GO AHEAD.
- OKAY, FIRST OFF...

03:23.083 --> 03:25.375
( whirs loudly, ceases )

03:25.376 --> 03:27.707
OKAY, AS I WAS
SAYING, I DON'T...

03:27.708 --> 03:29.589
( whirs loudly, ceases )

03:29.590 --> 03:32.792
- WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY WAS I DON'T...
- ( whirs loudly, ceases )

03:32.793 --> 03:34.964
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP DOING THAT UNTIL
I AGREE TO GO TO THERAPY, AREN'T YOU?

03:34.965 --> 03:36.796
- OH, IS THIS FRUSTRATING YOU?
- LITTLE BIT, YEP.

03:36.797 --> 03:39.008
WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD TALK
ABOUT THAT FRUSTRATION

03:39.009 --> 03:40.390
IN OUR FIRST SESSION.

03:40.391 --> 03:41.971
FINE, I'LL GO.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.344
- YAY!
- BUT NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT, OKAY?

03:44.345 --> 03:46.106
- IT'S BECAUSE I'M JUST TRYING TO...
- ( whirs loudly )

03:47.848 --> 03:50.190
- I...
- ( continues whirring )

03:52.192 --> 03:53.113
AND THEN, AT THE 10-SECOND MARK,

03:53.114 --> 03:54.564
CASSANDRA'S SUPERPOWERS KICK IN.

03:54.565 --> 03:56.155
SHE'S READING "ROMEO
AND JULIET" AND...

03:56.156 --> 03:58.027
And Juliet leaps off the page.

03:58.028 --> 04:00.450
Well, with my animation, it'll
be less of a graceful leap.

04:00.451 --> 04:02.201
More of a choppy bounce.

04:02.202 --> 04:04.784
And then, Cassandra
says to Juliet,

04:04.785 --> 04:07.287
"Listen, girl, I know he has
cute floppy hair and all..."

04:07.288 --> 04:08.458
"But he is so not worth it."

04:08.459 --> 04:10.129
"Totally."

04:10.130 --> 04:12.171
You know, Zander, even though
you're halfway across the country,

04:12.172 --> 04:14.294
it feels like you're
right here in my room.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.756
Just with a four-second delay.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.298
Yeah, I totally know...

04:18.299 --> 04:20.259
what...

04:20.260 --> 04:22.842
I was just messing with you.

04:22.843 --> 04:25.014
HEY, BABE. RYDER SAID
YOU WERE ON THE PHONE.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.766
HEY, EMERSON. ( clears throat )

04:26.767 --> 04:29.148
YEAH, I AM JUST FINISHING
UP A SESSION WITH ZANDER.

04:29.149 --> 04:32.101
HE'S MY... HE'S MY
CREATIVE PARTNER.

04:32.102 --> 04:34.103
OH, THE EX.

04:34.104 --> 04:35.445
DUDE, WHAT'S UP?

04:35.446 --> 04:37.236
HEY, I KNOW THIS
COULD BE AWKWARD.

04:37.237 --> 04:39.319
NEW BOYFRIEND, OLD BOYFRIEND.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.700
BUT LISTEN... I'M NOT JEALOUS.

04:40.701 --> 04:42.281
LENNOX TOLD ME IT'S
STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL

04:42.282 --> 04:43.282
BETWEEN YOU TWO NOW.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.824
Ah, that's interesting.

04:44.825 --> 04:47.327
Lennox told me absolutely
nothing about a new boyfriend.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.958
( chuckles ) YEAH.

04:48.959 --> 04:50.119
YOU KNOW, I MEANT TO TELL YOU.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.961
I WAS JUST WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT TIME.

04:51.962 --> 04:54.213
Apparently out of nowhere
is the right time.

04:54.214 --> 04:55.715
- ZANDER...
- No, no. It's fine.

04:55.716 --> 04:57.507
I get it, you know.
You're in college now.

04:57.508 --> 04:59.379
It's good that you're meeting
all the new freshmen.

04:59.380 --> 05:01.511
ACTUALLY, I'M HER
PHILOSOPHY T.A.

05:01.512 --> 05:03.262
Oh, wow.

05:03.263 --> 05:05.555
You know, dating a
teaching assistant

05:05.556 --> 05:07.266
is really not allowed
at my school.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.018
But, hey, that's probably
a rule that was created

05:09.019 --> 05:10.810
for no reason whatsoever.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.021
( chuckles )

05:12.022 --> 05:14.193
LISTEN, WE SHOULD
REALLY GET GOING.

05:14.194 --> 05:16.436
Okay, well, have fun
you two lovebirds.

05:16.437 --> 05:18.488
Or should I say one
sweet, innocent lovebird

05:18.489 --> 05:19.739
and one much older predator.

05:19.740 --> 05:22.242
GOOD-BYE!

05:25.155 --> 05:27.657
OKAY, THIS IS NOT A JUDGMENT
ABOUT THE THERAPIST,

05:27.658 --> 05:29.328
BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT

05:29.329 --> 05:32.372
THAT ALL THE
MAGAZINES HERE SUCK.

05:32.373 --> 05:35.254
JOE, YOU PROMISED YOU'D
HAVE AN OPEN MIND.

05:35.255 --> 05:36.376
- RIGHT.
- AND WHEN WE GO IN THERE,

05:36.377 --> 05:38.167
- YOU'LL PARTICIPATE, RIGHT?
- YEP.

05:38.168 --> 05:39.759
AND YOU'LL USE MORE
THAN ONE SYLLABLE?

05:39.760 --> 05:41.011
DONE.

05:42.883 --> 05:45.344
LOOK, DR. KATHRYN MILLER IS THE
BEST THERAPIST IN THE CITY.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.387
SHE EVEN SAVED MY FRIEND
REBECCA AND PHIL'S MARRIAGE

05:47.388 --> 05:51.891
AND THAT WAS AFTER
PHIL BECAME FELICITY.

05:51.892 --> 05:53.393
I'M JUST GOING TO
THROW THIS OUT THERE.

05:53.394 --> 05:56.566
THAT'S NOT GOING TO
BE OUR ISSUE, OKAY?

05:56.567 --> 05:58.317
THANKS FOR POINTING
THAT OUT, THOUGH.

05:58.318 --> 05:59.859
AND YOU CAN STOP WITH THE
SALES PITCH, MEL. I'M HERE.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.441
DON'T I GET A STICKER OR
SOMETHING FOR JUST SHOWING UP?

06:01.442 --> 06:03.403
YEAH, JOE, THAT'S
WHY WE'RE HERE.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.865
FOR THE STICKERS.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.248
OH, YOU MUST BE...

06:09.249 --> 06:11.121
JOE?

06:13.253 --> 06:14.414
KATIE?

06:14.415 --> 06:16.335
ACTUALLY, I GO BY KATHRYN HERE.

06:16.336 --> 06:17.957
OH, YOU GUYS KNOW EACH OTHER?

06:17.958 --> 06:19.759
( chuckles )

06:19.760 --> 06:22.381
IT'S A FUNNY STORY,
ACTUALLY, HONEY.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.303
- WE...
- DATED.

06:24.304 --> 06:26.005
BRIEFLY. YEARS AGO.

06:26.006 --> 06:27.096
SHE BEAT ME TO IT.

06:27.097 --> 06:28.267
IF THIS IS A PROBLEM,

06:28.268 --> 06:30.810
I'M HAPPY TO WAIVE MY
24-HOUR CANCELLATION FEE.

06:30.811 --> 06:32.722
NO, DON'T, YOU'RE THE BEST
THERAPIST IN THE CITY

06:32.723 --> 06:34.974
AND IT WAS TOUGH TO GET
CERTAIN PEOPLE DOWN HERE.

06:34.975 --> 06:36.726
WELL, IF NEITHER OF
YOU HAVE AN ISSUE,

06:36.727 --> 06:38.648
I'M COMFORTABLE PUTTING
THE PAST ASIDE.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.359
I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN JOE AND ME

06:40.360 --> 06:41.781
WAS SO LONG AGO.

06:41.782 --> 06:43.783
- YEARS AGO, ACTUALLY.
- IT'S INSIGNIFICANT NOW.

06:43.784 --> 06:45.234
YEAH, IT WAS A BLIP.
IT WAS A BLIP, REALLY.

06:45.235 --> 06:46.656
NOT EVEN A BLIP,
ACTUALLY, MORE LIKE A...

06:46.657 --> 06:50.660
YOU KNOW, A... BLIP!

06:50.661 --> 06:52.622
THEN WE'RE GOOD. THIS
IS NOT A BIG DEAL.

06:52.623 --> 06:54.333
I CAN'T TELL YOU THE AMOUNT OF
TIMES WE'VE RUN INTO SOMEONE

06:54.334 --> 06:56.245
I'VE HOOKED UP WITH... I
MEAN, HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

06:56.246 --> 06:57.707
LIKE, ALL THE TIME.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.418
OKAY. OKAY, MEL...
MEL, THANK YOU.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.462
LET'S SAVE SOMETHING FOR
THE SESSION, SHALL WE?

07:03.464 --> 07:04.674
SO WE WERE IN THE
PARKING STRUCTURE

07:04.675 --> 07:06.095
AND I SUGGESTED GOING UP A LEVEL

07:06.096 --> 07:08.307
BUT JOE REFUSED, AND I PARK
IN THAT STRUCTURE EVERY DAY.

07:08.308 --> 07:10.810
I MEAN, EVERY DAY.

07:10.811 --> 07:12.892
YOU KNOW, I'M NOTICING
A PATTERN HERE.

07:12.893 --> 07:15.184
WHAT I'M HEARING IS
THAT JOE IS, BY NATURE,

07:15.185 --> 07:17.517
VERY STRONG-WILLED AND
NOT OPEN TO NEW IDEAS.

07:17.518 --> 07:19.940
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT, JOE?

07:21.692 --> 07:23.483
YOU REALLY HIT THE NAIL
ON THE HEAD, KATIE.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.945
I MEAN, YOU ARE AN AMAZINGLY
PERCEPTIVE PERSON.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.117
SO YOU AGREE THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO WORK ON?

07:28.118 --> 07:30.700
ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY.
100%. AND THANK YOU.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.331
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
POINTING THAT OUT TO ME.

07:32.332 --> 07:37.076
I DON'T KNOW WHY NO ONE ELSE HAS
EVER SAID THAT TO ME BEFORE.

07:37.077 --> 07:38.578
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

07:38.579 --> 07:41.460
I SAID THAT. I SAID
THAT YESTERDAY.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.002
I THINK I WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED

07:43.003 --> 07:44.343
IF SHE HAD SAID SOMETHING
THAT INSIGHTFUL.

07:44.344 --> 07:47.176
CLEARLY NOT.

07:47.177 --> 07:48.758
PERHAPS YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.470
SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT FOR
COUPLES TO REALLY HEAR EACH OTHER.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.684
WOW, THAT IS ANOTHER
GREAT POINT, KATIE.

07:54.685 --> 07:56.516
I'M SORRY.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.097
DR. MILLER. ( laughs )

07:58.098 --> 08:00.399
YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN SUCH AN
EYE-OPENING EXPERIENCE FOR ME.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.192
I MEAN, I GUESS SOMETIMES
IT REALLY DOES TAKE

08:03.193 --> 08:05.735
A THIRD PERSON TO COME IN AND HELP
TWO PEOPLE OUT WITH THEIR PROBLEMS.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.157
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THREE
IS GREATER THAN TWO.

08:08.158 --> 08:10.069
IT'S REALLY... IT'S
REALLY JUST MATH.

08:10.070 --> 08:12.242
RIGHT?

08:13.574 --> 08:14.954
YEAH.

08:14.955 --> 08:17.116
YOU KNOW, MEL, ONE
SYLLABLE RESPONSES

08:17.117 --> 08:19.039
ARE NOT ALWAYS THE MOST HELPFUL.

08:21.331 --> 08:24.214
SHE'S GOOD.

08:29.930 --> 08:33.052
- ZANDER.
- SURPRISE.

08:33.053 --> 08:34.183
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:34.184 --> 08:35.555
I WAS REALLY HOPING FOR,

08:35.556 --> 08:37.977
"HEY, HAVE YOU
BEEN WORKING OUT?"

08:37.978 --> 08:39.348
'CAUSE I HAVE.

08:39.349 --> 08:42.942
WAIT... WHAT... YOU HAVE
CLASS IN 10 MINUTES.

08:42.943 --> 08:44.523
IN VERMONT.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.066
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO MISS IT.

08:47.067 --> 08:49.198
I ACTUALLY CAME INTO TOWN
FOR MY AUNT'S FUNERAL.

08:49.199 --> 08:50.950
OH. OH, MY GOD.

08:50.951 --> 08:52.992
I AM SO SORRY. COME IN.

08:52.993 --> 08:56.535
THANKS. I APPRECIATE IT.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.828
ACTUALLY, IT WAS MY AUNT'S
CAT'S FUNERAL, BUT...

08:58.829 --> 09:01.000
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT HE'S GONE,

09:01.001 --> 09:04.874
IT'S REALLY JUST A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THE OLD LADY LETS GO TOO.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.876
ANYWAYS, POINT IS, I'M HERE.

09:06.877 --> 09:07.838
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MIDTERMS?

09:07.839 --> 09:10.800
THEY LET YOU MAKE 'EM UP.
I THINK.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.051
YOU KNOW WHAT... I'LL
JUST TELL THE DEAN

09:12.052 --> 09:13.673
THAT I WAS SAD.

09:13.674 --> 09:15.975
GETS YOU OUT OF
ANYTHING AT ART SCHOOL.

09:15.976 --> 09:17.807
UH-HUH...

09:17.808 --> 09:19.599
RIGHT, OKAY. SO LISTEN, LEN.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.851
THE UNTIMELY PASSING
OF MY AUNT'S CAT

09:21.852 --> 09:25.855
HAS GOT ME THINKING.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.988
SHOULD YOU REALLY BE DATING
YOUR TEACHING ASSISTANT?

09:28.989 --> 09:31.611
I MEAN, SHOULD ANYBODY? REALLY?
'CAUSE... UGH.

09:31.612 --> 09:32.952
OH, GEE.

09:32.953 --> 09:34.573
YOU KNOW, THE DEATH OF
A CAT AFFECTS US ALL

09:34.574 --> 09:36.365
IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

09:36.366 --> 09:38.998
AND SOME THAT ARE NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS, ZANDER.

09:38.999 --> 09:40.830
YEAH, YEAH, UH-HUH. UNDERSTOOD.

09:40.831 --> 09:43.002
SO AREN'T YOU JUST LIKE
A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED

09:43.003 --> 09:45.084
THAT HE'LL TREAT YOU DIFFERENTLY
THAN THE OTHER STUDENTS?

09:45.085 --> 09:48.968
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU
TREAT HIM DIFFERENTLY.

09:48.969 --> 09:50.129
WHAT, YOU THINK HE'LL
GIVE ME AN AUTOMATIC "A"

09:50.130 --> 09:52.011
BECAUSE I'M HIS GIRLFRIEND?

09:52.012 --> 09:54.553
NOT AUTOMATIC. I MEAN, I'M SURE
YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK FOR IT.

09:54.554 --> 09:56.716
EXCUSE ME?

09:56.717 --> 09:58.017
NO. NO. MM-MM.

09:58.018 --> 09:59.929
NO, SEE, THE...
WHAT I MEANT WAS...

09:59.930 --> 10:03.022
IS THAT HE'S... HE'S
OLDER, YOU KNOW.

10:03.023 --> 10:04.273
AND HE MIGHT ABUSE HIS POWER.

10:04.274 --> 10:07.276
I'M 18 AND HE'S 23, OKAY?

10:07.277 --> 10:09.358
THERE IS NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.399
Mel: LENNOX.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.781
OH, WHAT DID MEL AND JOE SAY

10:11.782 --> 10:13.112
WHEN YOU TOLD THEM YOU
WERE DATING YOUR T.A.?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.074
SHH! THEY'LL HEAR YOU.

10:15.075 --> 10:17.076
OH! YOU HAVEN'T TOLD THEM YET

10:17.077 --> 10:18.868
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
DOING IS WRONG... HA!

10:18.869 --> 10:20.199
OH, ZANDER.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.001
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN TOWN.

10:22.002 --> 10:24.503
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS
LENNOX DOING WRONG?

10:24.504 --> 10:26.876
WELL, MEL, I HATE
TO RAT LENNOX OUT.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.918
BUT SHE'S BEEN...

10:28.919 --> 10:31.420
SMUGGLING FOOD OUT
OF THE DINING HALL.

10:31.421 --> 10:32.962
OH, THAT'S NOT WRONG.

10:32.963 --> 10:34.964
IN POLITICS, WE DEFINE WRONG

10:34.965 --> 10:37.596
AS "WILL ANYONE REALLY NOTICE?"

10:37.597 --> 10:38.808
YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF WHICH,

10:38.809 --> 10:40.059
AT THE BUDGET MEETING TODAY

10:40.060 --> 10:43.102
I YELLED OUT, "DIBS
ON THE BAGELS!"

10:43.103 --> 10:44.604
HERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT.
SAVE ME ONE.

10:47.067 --> 10:48.938
HEY, JOE, WE NEED TO TALK

10:48.939 --> 10:50.359
ABOUT THIS MORNING'S
THERAPY SESSION.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.732
HAPPY TO. CAN'T WAIT
FOR THE NEXT SESSION.

10:52.733 --> 10:54.443
YEAH, WELL, THAT WILL BE TUESDAY

10:54.444 --> 10:57.156
THE 14TH OF NEVER.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.118
WHAT WAS THAT LITTLE "TEACHER'S
PET" ROUTINE OF YOURS?

10:59.119 --> 11:00.119
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:00.120 --> 11:01.660
COME ON! YOU SPENT
THE WHOLE TIME

11:01.661 --> 11:03.202
BENDING OVER BACKWARDS
TRYING TO KISS HER BUTT.

11:03.203 --> 11:05.494
IT WAS LIKE WATCHING THE CIRQUE
DU SOLEIL OF ASS-KISSING.

11:05.495 --> 11:08.587
WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:08.588 --> 11:11.000
HOLD UP, HOLD UP.
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

11:11.001 --> 11:13.632
OF A TALL, BEAUTIFUL,
HIGHLY-EDUCATED PROFESSIONAL WOMAN

11:13.633 --> 11:14.964
YOU USED TO DATE?

11:14.965 --> 11:16.635
PLEASE.

11:16.636 --> 11:18.467
OH, COME ON. IT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

11:18.468 --> 11:21.180
IT MEANT NOTHING, YOU KNOW, AND
AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,

11:21.181 --> 11:23.432
- I BROKE UP WITH HER.
- YOU BROKE UP WITH HER?

11:23.433 --> 11:25.604
YEAH, SHE WASN'T WHAT I WAS
LOOKING FOR, SO I ENDED IT.

11:25.605 --> 11:27.186
YOU BROKE UP WITH HER.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.728
YES, I BROKE UP WITH
HER, ALL RIGHT?

11:28.729 --> 11:30.109
IT DIDN'T MATTER TO HER AND
IT DIDN'T MATTER TO ME.

11:30.110 --> 11:31.440
AND I THOUGHT IT
DIDN'T MATTER TO YOU,

11:31.441 --> 11:32.982
BUT APPARENTLY I WAS WRONG.

11:32.983 --> 11:36.275
WAIT, SO IF THIS
WASN'T ABOUT KATHRYN,

11:36.276 --> 11:39.028
THEN... OKAY. I GET IT.

11:39.029 --> 11:40.699
YOU WERE TRYING TO
BEAT ME AT THERAPY.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.782
HONEY, PLEASE. IT'S
NOT A COMPETITION.

11:42.783 --> 11:44.623
OKAY? ( laughs )

11:44.624 --> 11:47.586
BUT IF IT WAS, PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE BEEN A SHUTOUT.

11:47.587 --> 11:51.670
YOU KNOW, THERAPY IS NOT
ABOUT WHO WINS AND LOSES.

11:51.671 --> 11:53.672
IT'S ABOUT DOING WHAT'S
BEST FOR THE RELATIONSHIP.

11:53.673 --> 11:55.214
BUT IF IT WAS A COMPETITION,

11:55.215 --> 11:57.636
I WOULD SMOKE YOU
LIKE A CUBAN CIGAR.

11:57.637 --> 12:00.009
YEAH, WELL, WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO SEE NEXT TIME, WON'T WE?

12:00.010 --> 12:02.051
MM-HMM.

12:02.052 --> 12:03.052
CLEARLY WE NEED HELP.

12:03.053 --> 12:05.185
YEAH.

12:09.269 --> 12:12.231
OH, HI, MEL. HAVE
YOU BEEN HERE LONG?

12:12.232 --> 12:13.983
OH, DON'T WORRY, I DIDN'T
HEAR ANYTHING YOU SAID

12:13.984 --> 12:15.064
TO YOUR LAST PATIENT.

12:15.065 --> 12:17.196
JUST THE "WAH, WAH,
NOBODY LOVES ME" PART.

12:17.197 --> 12:20.780
ACTUALLY, I WAS IN
THERE BY MYSELF.

12:20.781 --> 12:21.991
KIDDING!

12:21.992 --> 12:24.123
YOU KNOW, MEL, I AM IMPRESSED

12:24.124 --> 12:25.865
THAT YOU'RE CONTINUING
TO SEE ME EVEN THOUGH

12:25.866 --> 12:27.246
YOU KNOW I DATED JOE.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.128
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT.

12:29.129 --> 12:30.669
IT SHOWS A LOT OF MATURITY.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.171
WELL, I'M IMPRESSED
THAT YOU'RE OKAY

12:32.172 --> 12:35.214
HEARING ABOUT ME AND JOE
AFTER HE DUMPED YOU.

12:35.215 --> 12:37.046
I HAVE TO SAY I AM NOT
ON THE BEST OF TERMS

12:37.047 --> 12:39.218
WITH A LOT OF THE GUYS THAT
GAVE ME THE OLD HEAVE-HO.

12:39.219 --> 12:41.550
THAT'S WHAT JOE TOLD YOU, IS IT?

12:41.551 --> 12:43.222
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- OH, NOTHING.

12:43.223 --> 12:45.434
YOUR FACE DIDN'T REALLY
LOOK LIKE, "OH, NOTHING."

12:45.435 --> 12:47.346
WELL, NOT TO DREDGE UP THE PAST,

12:47.347 --> 12:49.648
BUT I WAS DEFINITELY THE
ONE WHO BROKE IT OFF.

12:49.649 --> 12:50.940
NOT JOE.

12:50.941 --> 12:54.153
OH, OKAY. WELL, I
GUESS, YOU KNOW,

12:54.154 --> 12:56.155
JOE PROBABLY SHADED THE
TRUTH OUT OF PRIDE.

12:56.156 --> 12:58.107
THE THERAPEUTIC TERM
FOR THAT IS "LYING."

12:58.108 --> 13:01.110
OKAY, BUT IT'S NOT THAT
BIG OF A DEAL, RIGHT?

13:01.111 --> 13:02.992
'CAUSE JOE PROMISED HE'S
GONNA WORK ON HIMSELF.

13:02.993 --> 13:04.243
YES, BUT WHAT IF HE'S LYING?

13:04.244 --> 13:07.246
SINCE APPARENTLY HE
HAS NO PROBLEM LYING.

13:07.247 --> 13:08.287
BUT YOU SAID IN OUR LAST SESSION

13:08.288 --> 13:09.708
THAT JOE WAS MAKING
REAL PROGRESS.

13:09.709 --> 13:12.331
YES, BUT THAT'S BEFORE I
KNEW ABOUT THE LYING.

13:12.332 --> 13:16.045
OKAY, COULD YOU STOP
SAYING LYING FOR A SEC?

13:16.046 --> 13:17.256
LISTEN, MEL,

13:17.257 --> 13:18.677
I'M NOT SAYING THIS
AS YOUR THERAPIST,

13:18.678 --> 13:20.089
BUT WOMAN TO WOMAN,

13:20.090 --> 13:22.051
I'D SAY THAT JOE'S
REVISIONIST HISTORY

13:22.052 --> 13:23.302
ABOUT WHO BROKE UP WITH WHO

13:23.303 --> 13:25.264
IS JUST, WELL, VERY TELLING.

13:25.265 --> 13:28.187
TELLING LIKE TELLING
A FUN STORY, OR...

13:28.188 --> 13:29.478
TELLING OF A LARGER ISSUE.

13:29.479 --> 13:31.851
I'M JUST GLAD I SPOTTED
THE WARNING SIGNS EARLY

13:31.852 --> 13:33.142
AND GOT OUT WHEN I DID.

13:33.143 --> 13:35.274
LOOK, I KNOW THINGS DIDN'T
WORK OUT WITH YOU AND HIM,

13:35.275 --> 13:36.936
BUT JOE AND I HAVE A
GREAT RELATIONSHIP.

13:36.937 --> 13:38.697
AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAME
TO SEE A THERAPIST...

13:38.698 --> 13:40.779
TO TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT
YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS?

13:40.780 --> 13:42.031
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS SOLID.

13:42.032 --> 13:43.652
WE JUST CAME IN FOR
A LITTLE TUNE-UP.

13:43.653 --> 13:47.246
LISTEN, MEL, IF I COULD GIVE YOU
A PIECE OF ADVICE ABOUT JOE...

13:47.247 --> 13:49.949
RUN! RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

13:49.950 --> 13:52.661
BUT, WELL, JOE LOVES ME.

13:52.662 --> 13:54.663
AND IF HE CAN'T BE
HONEST WITH YOU NOW,

13:54.664 --> 13:57.086
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
IN THE FUTURE?

13:57.087 --> 13:58.087
( door opening )

13:58.088 --> 13:59.378
HEY! I'M HERE, I'M HERE.

13:59.379 --> 14:01.300
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.
WHAT DID I MISS?

14:01.301 --> 14:02.962
NOTHING. WE HAVEN'T STARTED YET.

14:02.963 --> 14:04.223
OH, GOOD.

14:04.224 --> 14:06.265
( stammers ) I JUST REMEMBERED...
I HAVE A THING.

14:06.266 --> 14:07.516
YOU HAVE A THING? WHAT THING?

14:07.517 --> 14:09.558
A BIG THING. A THING
WE CAN'T MISS.

14:09.559 --> 14:12.021
AND WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT
NOW AND NEVER COME BACK.

14:12.022 --> 14:13.232
BUT WAIT, WHAT?!

14:13.233 --> 14:16.395
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FORGOT ABOUT
IT UNTIL JUST NOW. BYE!

14:16.396 --> 14:18.277
BUT I... I... I JUST
PAID FOR PARKING.

14:18.278 --> 14:19.609
IT WAS LIKE EIGHT DOLLARS.

14:22.482 --> 14:24.573
OH, MY GOODNESS. CHECK
OUT THIS DRIVEL

14:24.574 --> 14:27.406
YOUR FELLOW STUDENT WROTE
ON THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC.

14:27.407 --> 14:31.330
"MR. HEGEL'S COOL IDEAS NEVER
TRULY GO OUT OF STYLE."

14:31.331 --> 14:32.541
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT, BABE?

14:32.542 --> 14:34.994
I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD READ THAT TO ME.

14:34.995 --> 14:36.295
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:36.296 --> 14:37.836
JUST HEARING IT COULD
KILL BRAIN CELLS. "D."

14:37.837 --> 14:39.088
OH, WAIT.

14:39.089 --> 14:40.669
NO, HIS PARENTS ARE ALUMNI.

14:40.670 --> 14:42.761
( winces ) "C."

14:42.762 --> 14:44.883
OOH.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.057
HERE'S AN INTERESTING
TEST BY LENNOX SCANLON.

14:48.058 --> 14:49.558
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:49.559 --> 14:52.351
I... I CAN LEAVE THE
ROOM WHILE YOU GRADE IT.

14:52.352 --> 14:54.013
NO, NO, NO. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

14:54.014 --> 14:56.355
YOUR SMOKIN' HOT
PRESENCE WON'T SWAY ME.

14:56.356 --> 14:58.647
OKAY, WELL, JUST DON'T
TELL ME MY GRADE.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.110
SHH, SHH, SHH. I'M
READING SOMETHING.

15:01.111 --> 15:05.114
SOMETHING VERY INTELLIGENT

15:05.115 --> 15:07.406
THAT BEARS OUT MY
CHOICE IN GIRLFRIENDS.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.078
UH-OH!

15:09.079 --> 15:11.080
WHAT'S UH-OH?

15:11.081 --> 15:13.372
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION
ON THE BACK OF THE PAGE.

15:13.373 --> 15:15.995
( gasps ) THERE WAS A
QUESTION ON THE BACK?

15:15.996 --> 15:17.246
LENNOX, RELAX... I KNOW YOU KNOW

15:17.247 --> 15:20.249
THE SUPPOSED CONTRADICTIONS
BETWEEN BEING AND NOT BEING.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.250
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. RIGHT?

15:21.251 --> 15:22.251
YEAH, BUT...

15:22.252 --> 15:24.383
CHECK. "A."

15:24.384 --> 15:25.804
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:25.805 --> 15:28.177
I'M JUST GIVING YOU THE
GRADE YOU DESERVE, BABE.

15:28.178 --> 15:31.310
UM, OKAY.

15:31.311 --> 15:33.682
AND JUST ACT ALL SURPRISED
WHEN I HAND BACK THE TESTS.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.014
LIKE IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

15:35.015 --> 15:36.186
HMM...

15:40.110 --> 15:42.611
SO, THEN... WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO, MS. BURKE?

15:42.612 --> 15:45.904
WELL, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I
KNEW UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON.

15:45.905 --> 15:47.236
OH, YOU MEAN ABOUT THE
AIR-CONDITIONING?

15:47.237 --> 15:49.238
UM, I... I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, WAYNE?

15:49.239 --> 15:50.279
I SAY DUMP IT.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.411
YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS
TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

15:52.412 --> 15:53.872
YOU'RE BETTER OFF REPLACING
IT WITH A NEW SYSTEM

15:53.873 --> 15:55.284
THAT DOESN'T HAVE
SO MANY ISSUES.

15:55.285 --> 15:57.626
BUT I LIKE THIS ONE.

15:57.627 --> 15:59.538
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH IT
CAN BE LOUD AND ANNOYING

15:59.539 --> 16:01.920
AND SOMETIMES I
WANT TO SMACK IT...

16:01.921 --> 16:03.292
HUH?

16:03.293 --> 16:05.584
I MEAN, I'M COMFORTABLE
WITH THIS ONE, YOU KNOW?

16:05.585 --> 16:06.925
I MEAN, THE CURRENT
AIR-CONDITIONING UNIT.

16:06.926 --> 16:08.717
I DON'T KNOW. YOU
STICK WITH THIS ONE,

16:08.718 --> 16:11.010
IT'S JUST GONNA CAUSE
YOU A WORLD OF PAIN.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.472
BUT WHAT IF THIS
SYSTEM IS THE ONE?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.683
YOU KNOW, FOR MY HOUSE.

16:14.684 --> 16:17.356
I MEAN, I DON'T APPRECIATE
PEOPLE TELLING ME

16:17.357 --> 16:19.938
I SHOULD GET RID OF SOMETHING
I'VE LIVED WITH FOR SO LONG

16:19.939 --> 16:21.941
AND CAN SEE SPENDING THE
REST OF MY LIFE WITH.

16:24.314 --> 16:27.867
THIS ISN'T REALLY ABOUT THE
AIR CONDITIONER, IS IT?

16:30.370 --> 16:32.321
HOW 'BOUT I COME BACK
IN A WEEK OR TWO

16:32.322 --> 16:34.783
AFTER YOU'VE HAD A CHANCE
TO COLLECT YOUR THOUGHTS...

16:34.784 --> 16:36.376
ON AIR-CONDITIONING.

16:38.458 --> 16:40.460
( sobbing )

16:41.461 --> 16:42.332
YEAH?

16:42.333 --> 16:44.463
HI. I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

16:44.464 --> 16:46.715
OH, IS IT UNSOLICITED ADVICE
ON HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE?

16:46.716 --> 16:48.837
'CAUSE I'M ALL STOCKED UP.

16:48.838 --> 16:51.470
NO, NO. IT'S JUST SOME NEW
ARTWORK FOR OUR WEB SERIES.

16:51.471 --> 16:53.972
SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING
BACK TO SCHOOL?

16:53.973 --> 16:55.934
YEAH. I'VE GOT MY MEETING
WITH THE DEAN TOMORROW,

16:55.935 --> 16:58.348
SO I'M WORKING ON MY LOOK OF DESPAIR.
HOW'S THIS?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.020
STICK OUT YOUR LOWER
LIP A LITTLE BIT.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.523
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.695
COME IN.

17:06.986 --> 17:09.108
BUT HEY, YOU KNOW,
WHILE I'M HERE,

17:09.109 --> 17:10.239
I JUST WANT TO SAY

17:10.240 --> 17:11.410
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

17:11.411 --> 17:13.152
WHEN I IMPLIED THAT YOU'RE
GETTING SPECIAL TREATMENT

17:13.153 --> 17:15.414
BY DATING YOUR T.A.
I WAS WAY OFF BASE.

17:15.415 --> 17:18.157
'CAUSE YOU'RE LIKE THE MOST
PRINCIPLED PERSON I KNOW.

17:18.158 --> 17:20.119
DON'T SAY THAT, PLEASE.

17:20.120 --> 17:22.501
NO, IT'S TRUE. AND
I JUST SAY THAT

17:22.502 --> 17:24.042
BECAUSE I REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.044
AS A FRIEND. NOT
AS A GIRLFRIEND.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.966
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW,

17:27.967 --> 17:31.510
BECAUSE YOU'RE... BECAUSE YOU'RE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE. RIGHT?

17:31.511 --> 17:34.303
YES, I AM.

17:34.304 --> 17:35.554
I SHOULD BE GETTING
BACK TO VERMONT.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.096
RIGHT.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.848
SO, BYE.

17:48.528 --> 17:49.609
I GOTTA GO.

17:55.455 --> 17:57.456
HEY, MEL. I GOT A
GUY IN THE GARAGE

17:57.457 --> 17:58.617
WAITING FOR A TRAINING SESSION,

17:58.618 --> 17:59.908
BUT I SAW YOUR CAR
IN THE DRIVEWAY

17:59.909 --> 18:01.460
SO I JUST WANTED TO COME SAY HI.

18:01.461 --> 18:03.962
OH, HELLO.

18:03.963 --> 18:05.464
HEY, UM... ARE YOU OKAY?

18:05.465 --> 18:06.416
'CAUSE YOU SEEMED A LITTLE...

18:06.417 --> 18:08.587
UPSET THIS AFTERNOON.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.420
OH, I WAS. BUT, YOU
KNOW, I'M OKAY NOW.

18:11.421 --> 18:13.972
THIS HELPED.

18:13.973 --> 18:15.304
ALL RIGHT.

18:15.305 --> 18:16.715
( sighing )

18:16.716 --> 18:18.767
HEY, JOE, CAN I ASK
YOU A QUICK QUESTION?

18:18.768 --> 18:20.098
SURE. WHAT'S UP?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.640
ARE WE GONNA MAKE IT?

18:21.641 --> 18:23.313
OF COURSE.

18:24.684 --> 18:27.226
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

18:27.227 --> 18:29.398
BE HONEST. DO YOU THINK WE
HAVE A FUTURE TOGETHER?

18:29.399 --> 18:30.529
AS A COUPLE?

18:30.530 --> 18:32.070
WHERE'S THIS COMING FROM, MEL?

18:32.071 --> 18:34.903
WELL, UH... WHEN I
TALKED TO KATHRYN TODAY

18:34.904 --> 18:36.535
SHE TOLD ME SOMETHING
VERY INTERESTING.

18:36.536 --> 18:38.867
SHE SAID THAT SHE
BROKE UP WITH YOU.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.499
IS THAT TRUE?

18:40.500 --> 18:43.292
YOU KNOW WHAT? NOW
THAT I THINK ABOUT IT

18:43.293 --> 18:45.914
THAT... THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.

18:45.915 --> 18:48.507
SO THEN WHY DID YOU
TELL ME YOU DUMPED HER?

18:48.508 --> 18:50.048
MAN, IT'S HOT IN HERE.

18:50.049 --> 18:51.920
THE A.C. GUY EVER COME
OVER TODAY OR WHAT?

18:51.921 --> 18:54.883
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.596
LOOK, MEL, UM... THERE'S A
PERFECTLY GOOD EXPLANATION

18:57.597 --> 18:59.388
FOR ALL THIS, OKAY?
AND ONCE YOU HEAR IT,

18:59.389 --> 19:01.681
IT WILL ANSWER ALL
OF YOUR QUESTIONS.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.725
I LIED.

19:06.726 --> 19:08.146
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.768
DO YOU WANT A RELATIONSHIP
BUILT ON LIES?

19:09.769 --> 19:12.321
WAIT A MINUTE, NOW. IT'S NOT LIES.
IT WAS A LIE.

19:12.322 --> 19:14.443
AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN KNOWN
ABOUT IT IF I HADN'T TOLD YOU.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.535
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

19:17.327 --> 19:18.537
POINT TAKEN.

19:18.538 --> 19:20.579
WHY WOULD YOU LIE TO ME?

19:20.580 --> 19:21.870
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU
THINK, ALL RIGHT?

19:21.871 --> 19:24.453
I... I LIED TO, UM...

19:24.454 --> 19:26.245
TO WHAT, JOE?

19:26.246 --> 19:28.707
I LIED BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO THINK

19:28.708 --> 19:31.049
YOU WERE DATING
SOMEBODY'S CAST-OFF.

19:31.050 --> 19:32.421
THAT'S WHY YOU DID IT?

19:32.422 --> 19:33.592
YES, YES. OKAY?

19:33.593 --> 19:36.215
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE THE BEST
AND I'M NOT ALWAYS THAT.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.217
AND YOU KNOW, I...
I GUESS I THOUGHT

19:38.218 --> 19:40.259
THAT IF YOU KNEW
THAT SHE DUMPED ME

19:40.260 --> 19:41.930
THAT YOU'D THINK LESS OF ME,

19:41.931 --> 19:43.682
AND, YOU KNOW, I KIND OF...

19:43.683 --> 19:47.145
I... I WANT TO BE SEEN
AS PERFECT IN YOUR EYES.

19:47.146 --> 19:50.980
OH, JOE. I'LL NEVER
SEE YOU THAT WAY.

19:55.024 --> 19:57.195
THANKS A LOT.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.987
NO, IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,

19:58.988 --> 20:01.660
I GUESS I'M NOT DONE
TRYING TO IMPRESS YOU YET.

20:01.661 --> 20:03.533
OH, AND I HOPE YOU NEVER ARE.

20:05.164 --> 20:07.205
HEY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
IT'S SO BAD THAT WE ARGUE.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.628
WE DON'T ARGUE. WHO
SAYS WE ARGUE?

20:09.629 --> 20:11.209
OKAY! WE DISAGREE WITH VOLUME

20:11.210 --> 20:13.041
AND DRIVE EACH OTHER INSANE.

20:13.042 --> 20:14.593
BUT YOU KNOW, WE GET IT ALL OUT.

20:14.594 --> 20:15.714
WE DON'T HOLD ANYTHING BACK.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.676
YEAH? I'M ACTUALLY KINDA

20:17.677 --> 20:19.339
HOLDING SOMETHING
BACK RIGHT NOW.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.180
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH ARGUING, THOUGH.

20:22.181 --> 20:23.181
( laughs )

20:23.182 --> 20:24.683
DON'T YOU HAVE A
CLIENT TO TRAIN?

20:24.684 --> 20:26.555
YEAH, I TOLD HIM TO WARM UP

20:26.556 --> 20:28.056
FOR TEN MINUTES ON
THE STAIRMASTER.

20:28.057 --> 20:30.479
THAT MEANS WE GOT NINE
WHOLE MINUTES, BABY.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.561
COME ON.

20:35.064 --> 20:36.114
HEY, WAYNE.

20:36.115 --> 20:37.906
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, MS.
BURKE.

20:37.907 --> 20:40.949
YEAH, WAYNE, I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T
GOING TO TALK FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

20:40.950 --> 20:42.741
- THIS COULDN'T WAIT.
- WHAT IS IT?

20:42.742 --> 20:46.244
( sighs ) YOUR AIR CONDITIONER
IS PERFECTLY FINE.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.286
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.127
BUT YOU TOLD ME TO DUMP IT.
YOU SAID IT WAS OUTMODED

20:49.128 --> 20:51.169
AND WOULD CAUSE ME NOTHING
BUT PAIN AND HEARTACHE.

20:51.170 --> 20:53.503
UM... I LIED.

20:54.714 --> 20:55.754
I'VE BEEN GETTING
A LOT OF PRESSURE

20:55.755 --> 20:57.466
FROM THE SUITS TO
SELL THE NEW SYSTEMS.

20:57.467 --> 20:59.338
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE PROFIT IS,

20:59.339 --> 21:01.470
BUT THEN I FELT TERRIBLE,
BECAUSE, WELL...

21:01.471 --> 21:04.182
OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS MORE IMPORTANT

21:04.183 --> 21:05.764
THAN MOVING SOME NEW CONDENSER.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.766
BUT THE AIR CONDITIONER'S
NOT WORKING PROPERLY.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.228
NAH. YOU JUST DON'T
KNOW HOW TO SET IT.

21:10.229 --> 21:11.269
I CAN SHOW YOU.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.651
WAIT, WAIT... SO YOU'RE SAYING

21:12.652 --> 21:14.563
MY SYSTEM IS FINE AND WONDERFUL?

21:14.564 --> 21:17.446
YEAH. THIS COULD BE THE
LAST SYSTEM YOU EVER BUY.

21:17.447 --> 21:18.857
IT SHOULD LAST A LIFETIME.

21:18.858 --> 21:20.360
( sighs )

21:21.571 --> 21:23.242
BLESS YOU.

21:26.205 --> 21:27.787
( whimpering )
