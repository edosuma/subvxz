00:01.793 --> 00:06.379
Previously on
"Survivor," devens and david.

00:06.413 --> 00:07.896
Weren't seeing eye to eye.

00:07.931 --> 00:09.758
Remember, we do have that Idol.

00:09.793 --> 00:10.758
Just give me the half back.

00:10.793 --> 00:13.310
If you don't mind, 'd like the
Hang on to it.

00:13.344 --> 00:15.172
Facing tribal Council.

00:15.206 --> 00:18.034
Wardog tried to get kama to turn
On each other.

00:18.068 --> 00:19.689
The final ain't going to be
Seven.

00:19.724 --> 00:21.137
Wardog may have a point.

00:21.172 --> 00:23.862
And it worked.

00:23.896 --> 00:31.896
Ron and jelly were left in the
Dark when eric was voted out at.

00:32.275 --> 00:34.275
He chose to go to the edge of
Extinction.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.620 --> 00:48.724
Wardog controlled the vote.

00:48.758 --> 00:51.034
Now I know the kama people are
Fractured.

00:51.068 --> 00:53.758
Ryan and julie did not have any
Idea it was coming.

00:53.793 --> 00:55.517
Their reaction was gold.

00:55.551 --> 00:59.793
So now myself, lauren and kelley
May get a chance the crack this.

00:59.827 --> 01:03.413
Game open.

01:03.448 --> 01:05.931
That tribal council was
Disaster.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.862
Julie and I were left out of the
Loop.

01:07.896 --> 01:11.206
So I'm kind of gutted.

01:11.241 --> 01:13.206
Are you okay with your decision?

01:13.241 --> 01:15.275
I mean, I guess we'll find Out.

01:15.310 --> 01:19.896
I've spent a lot of time
Making kama strong.

01:19.931 --> 01:21.137
We had the numbers.

01:21.172 --> 01:24.275
I'm sure people are going to
Look at this and say, how stupid.

01:24.310 --> 01:25.413
Were they?

01:25.448 --> 01:29.379
All they had to do was vote out
All the lesu members.

01:29.413 --> 01:32.793
Eric, I don't see him ever
Playing you, gavin, ever.

01:32.827 --> 01:36.103
All the power and control I
Thought I had I realize now I.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.000
Have absolutely none.

01:38.034 --> 01:41.310
I'm on the bottom and I'm
Probably going to be voted out.

01:41.344 --> 01:41.965
Next.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.275
I don't know what to say.

01:43.310 --> 01:44.769
I just didn't want the get
Played out.

01:44.793 --> 01:46.758
I pull off a huge move.

01:46.793 --> 01:48.827
Eric was my closest ally in this
Game.

01:48.862 --> 01:52.551
But he was keeping me behind the
Curtain.

01:52.586 --> 01:54.068
Well, that worked out well.

01:54.103 --> 01:55.344
Yeah.

01:55.379 --> 01:59.620
I'm not wanting to go to the
Final three with blank resume.

01:59.655 --> 02:02.517
I stepped up and decided to be
First one to throw the punch.

02:02.551 --> 02:07.241
I just want you all to know
Three million percent I'm with.

02:07.275 --> 02:08.517
You guys.

02:08.550 --> 02:11.241
I trust you all, and if we want
To make it a six, then we get

02:11.275 --> 02:13.931
Julia and victoria, because
Those are the two I have the.

02:13.965 --> 02:15.172
Most trust in.

02:15.206 --> 02:17.793
I made it apparent that I have
This new alliance, and I told.

02:17.827 --> 02:19.413
Them, guys, I'm with you now.

02:19.448 --> 02:23.517
This proves that I'm ready to
Take this six, you know, a new.

02:23.551 --> 02:24.310
Alliance, to the end.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.517
Ride or die.

02:26.551 --> 02:34.551
Ride or die.

02:35.068 --> 02:38.413
Tribal council went exactly
How I wanted it to go, except.

02:38.448 --> 02:42.586
For the fact that rick and I
Voted differently, because he.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.862
Wasn't willing to see my side of
It.

02:44.896 --> 02:46.344
The right side of it.

02:46.379 --> 02:49.620
We're on separate pages.

02:49.655 --> 02:50.275
But we're still together.

02:50.310 --> 02:51.379
We are, we are, we are.

02:51.413 --> 02:53.758
Even if I wanted to split with
Rick, I couldn't.

02:53.793 --> 02:57.551
We have to figure white house
Gets custody of our kid, this.

02:57.586 --> 03:00.862
Nugget of a hidden immunity idol
That is so very powerful, but.

03:00.896 --> 03:03.827
Not as long as it remains
Intact.

03:03.862 --> 03:05.413
How do we move forward.

03:05.448 --> 03:09.068
We reestablish trust with ron
And julie.

03:09.103 --> 03:12.344
Which should be easy for me,
Since I voted with them.

03:12.379 --> 03:13.586
Yeah.

03:13.620 --> 03:17.310
So the relationship needs to
Work because that idol is a tool.

03:17.344 --> 03:21.172
We're going to need to avoid one
Of us going home, and then we.

03:21.206 --> 03:23.286
Can make shake things up and
Actually take control of this.

03:23.310 --> 03:31.310
Game.

03:37.034 --> 03:40.551
I had a horrible tribal last
Night.

03:40.586 --> 03:43.379
It was a horrible blindside.

03:43.413 --> 03:45.206
Now here I am.

03:45.241 --> 03:47.689
On the edge of extinction.

03:47.724 --> 03:49.310
I finally get to see it.

03:49.344 --> 03:53.310
All I know about this place is
That it is hard, and there's not.

03:53.344 --> 03:55.517
Much to do.

03:55.551 --> 04:00.068
Plus I came to edge of
Extinction immediately after the.

04:00.103 --> 04:03.137
People that I sent here.

04:03.172 --> 04:10.275
And now today's going to suck.

04:10.310 --> 04:13.517
When you read that sign, no
Disrespect to everyone else.

04:13.551 --> 04:16.034
Here, but it doesn't hit as hard
When you're the second, third,

04:16.067 --> 04:18.493
Fourth, fifth person some when I
Showed up here, it was just in.

04:18.517 --> 04:20.896
The corner crying.

04:20.930 --> 04:23.448
The edge of extinction is its
Own unique challenge.

04:23.482 --> 04:25.206
There are no rewards here.

04:25.241 --> 04:28.137
There's no chance at pizza.

04:28.172 --> 04:32.344
In the game, there are a million
Distractions every day.

04:32.379 --> 04:40.000
Then you get here, and it's the
Great slowdown.

04:40.034 --> 04:46.137
It goes from a million to zero.

04:46.172 --> 04:50.344
And so it becomes easy to talk
Yourself off the edge of.

04:50.379 --> 04:51.448
Distinction.

04:51.482 --> 04:59.482
You raise a flag, and all the
Difficulties are gone.

05:02.413 --> 05:05.827
You guys ever seriously
Contemplated leaving this place?

05:05.862 --> 05:08.827
No, I'll stick it out.

05:08.862 --> 05:13.724
For a split second, I was
Like, to the right is the.

05:13.758 --> 05:14.620
Burgers and food.

05:14.655 --> 05:17.965
But that's not who I am.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.896
Eric is fighting himself and
Having some inner conflict, and.

05:20.931 --> 05:24.034
It does eyeball you, you know,
That flag is waving out there.

05:24.068 --> 05:27.655
It's so easy just to say, you
Know what, I don't think I'm.

05:27.689 --> 05:28.931
Going to win.

05:28.965 --> 05:31.620
It's only going to get harder,
And it might be wearing on eric.

05:31.655 --> 05:32.172
A little more.

05:32.206 --> 05:34.103
My god!

05:34.137 --> 05:38.068
You got a stingray, reem!

05:38.103 --> 05:38.862
All right.

05:38.896 --> 05:41.172
But chris ain't going Anywhere.

05:41.206 --> 05:44.379
Aubry I know for sure, she ain't
Going anywhere.

05:44.413 --> 05:46.896
Wow, chris.

05:46.931 --> 05:49.344
Reem is too invested to go
Anywhere.

05:49.379 --> 05:51.862
Chris, look at you go, man!

05:51.896 --> 05:53.206
I ain't going nowhere.

05:53.241 --> 05:54.172
Everyone is here the play.

05:54.206 --> 05:56.000
No one is going to be quitting
Any time soon.

05:56.034 --> 05:58.448
Nice job, buddy.

05:58.482 --> 05:59.896
Look at that guy.

05:59.931 --> 06:03.896
Chris comes back with a really
Big stingray, and I'm thinking,

06:03.931 --> 06:06.965
There's a story here for me to
Tell my kids about not giving.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.827
Up, because there's going to be
A lot of days in their life,

06:09.862 --> 06:13.379
Hard days, where I'm going to be
The one telling them, don't.

06:13.413 --> 06:13.862
Quit.

06:13.896 --> 06:15.275
Joe's up next.

06:15.310 --> 06:18.862
I don't know how many times
I'm going to have to talk myself.

06:18.896 --> 06:22.172
Out of raising that flag.

06:22.206 --> 06:25.379
That's amazing, but as a
Firefighter, I think I have more.

06:25.413 --> 06:27.620
Grit than the average person.

06:27.655 --> 06:31.379
Now I'll get to see how much
Grit I actually have.

06:31.413 --> 06:39.413
It may be a lot.

06:43.344 --> 06:44.624
How you feeling this morning?

06:44.655 --> 06:47.793
I don't know.

06:47.827 --> 06:50.068
I voted with you guys.

06:50.103 --> 06:51.310
You did?

06:51.344 --> 06:54.551
So it was me and ron were the
Only two out of it for kama.

06:54.586 --> 06:57.275
Everything is up in the air
After eric gets voted out.

06:57.310 --> 06:59.734
I was right that there were huge
Cracks in kama, I just didn't.

06:59.758 --> 07:01.586
Expect them last night.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.344
I'm going to concentrate on ron
And julie, because I showed them

07:04.379 --> 07:06.448
I was loyal, I voted with them.

07:06.482 --> 07:12.379
So I'm open to whatever you
And obviously... see how things.

07:12.413 --> 07:15.620
Develop and I want to make this
My own game at this point,

07:15.655 --> 07:16.517
Because I'm like...

07:16.551 --> 07:17.758
let's be the pilot.

07:17.793 --> 07:21.689
I was really upset that I
Wasn't included on the vote for

07:21.724 --> 07:22.896
Eric last night.

07:22.931 --> 07:26.344
It made me really start to
Question what to do and what the.

07:26.379 --> 07:33.275
Future of my game is doing to
Look like.

07:33.310 --> 07:35.965
So we could be a voting bloc
Of four.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.310
All we need is two more.

07:39.344 --> 07:42.655
I don't... I'm not saying
What I'm doing.

07:42.689 --> 07:43.931
I'm not saying anything.

07:43.965 --> 07:46.482
You think aurora would work
With us?

07:46.517 --> 07:47.724
Potentially.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.551
I think it's more one of your
Guys than ours at this point.

07:50.586 --> 07:51.793
What about wardog?

07:51.827 --> 07:55.241
Obviously I have my issues
With wardog, but he could sort.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.931
Of possibly work with us for a
Vote.

07:57.965 --> 08:02.413
I know you think we're kama
Strong, but I'm way past that.

08:02.448 --> 08:05.344
I feel like julie has been
Running the show for a long.

08:05.379 --> 08:06.448
Time.

08:06.482 --> 08:09.344
I feel like she could run away
With this whole game.

08:09.379 --> 08:10.620
She's so strategic.

08:10.655 --> 08:13.206
To me the two of us are on the
Bottom, and they're thinking of.

08:13.241 --> 08:14.034
Them as the final four.

08:14.068 --> 08:16.344
So I'm ready to jump ship now.

08:16.379 --> 08:20.448
But it's just scary to jump
Ship.

08:20.482 --> 08:28.482
There is no one watching out for
Me here, and, my god, it's.

08:30.896 --> 08:36.172
Like it's been 23 days, and I'm
Just counting the days until I.

08:36.206 --> 08:39.136
See my family again.

08:39.172 --> 08:41.551
Because I have no support.

08:41.586 --> 08:44.862
And last night's blindside on
Err thank I wasn't a part of.

08:44.896 --> 08:48.344
Just added to it.

08:48.379 --> 08:52.965
Sometimes the game is played in
Three-day chunks or it's like.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.275
Three-hour chunks or it's like
Three-minute chunks.

08:56.310 --> 08:56.758
That's how I feel.

08:56.793 --> 08:57.827
You are strong.

08:57.862 --> 08:58.758
You're going to do this.

08:58.793 --> 09:02.896
Thank you.

09:02.931 --> 09:08.793
I try and remember, why did I
Sign up for, this and it was to.

09:08.827 --> 09:11.758
Push myself and it was the move
Myself, but I feel like what aim.

09:11.793 --> 09:15.689
Even doing out here and where do
I go from here?

09:15.724 --> 09:18.724
I've already got my mind on
What I think needs to happen.

09:18.758 --> 09:19.034
Next.

09:19.068 --> 09:19.655
Okay.

09:19.689 --> 09:20.620
Okay.

09:20.655 --> 09:23.655
Play it out for me.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.758
We need the stay with the
Alliance we made last night.

09:26.793 --> 09:30.482
If you feel comfortable, we pull
In whoever else we want and just.

09:30.517 --> 09:31.655
Get david out.

09:31.689 --> 09:35.482
David is very sneaky and
Strategic, but there is this.

09:35.517 --> 09:40.482
Trio of lesu members in wardog,
Kelley, and lauren, and moving.

09:40.517 --> 09:43.724
Together with them, that is
Something that worries me.

09:43.758 --> 09:50.241
So what do y'all think today?

09:50.275 --> 09:53.586
The only reason I think we
Should do david overall is.

09:53.620 --> 09:56.275
Because he's been top four in
The immunity challenges.

09:56.310 --> 10:01.068
The next few votes I'm really
Going to have to evaluate the.

10:01.103 --> 10:05.206
Social relationships in the game
And whether I have the numbers,

10:05.241 --> 10:10.241
Because they have a trio that
Are just as strong together and.

10:10.275 --> 10:11.724
Don't seem to be going anywhere.

10:11.758 --> 10:15.758
And it's all very concerning for
Me.

10:28.103 --> 10:34.413
Come on in, guys.

10:34.448 --> 10:35.724
This thing.

10:35.758 --> 10:36.517
My god.

10:36.551 --> 10:38.517
David having Flashbacks.

10:38.551 --> 10:40.344
Yes, I am.

10:40.379 --> 10:41.896
We ran this challenge
In your season.

10:41.931 --> 10:43.310
Yep, I remember it well.

10:43.344 --> 10:44.620
How did that go?

10:44.655 --> 10:46.517
Not well for me.

10:46.551 --> 10:47.413
All right.

10:47.448 --> 10:50.482
Let's get to today's immunity
Challenge.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.862
First things first.

10:52.896 --> 10:56.689
Aurora, take back the
Hard-earned necklace.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.655
Thank you.

10:58.689 --> 11:01.517
Once again immunity is back up
For grabs.

11:01.551 --> 11:05.379
For today's chang, you're going
To stand on a narrow beam while.

11:05.413 --> 11:08.896
Balancing a ball on a wooden
Bow.

11:08.931 --> 11:11.827
At regular intervals you'll move
Further down the beam, making it.

11:11.862 --> 11:13.137
More difficult.

11:13.172 --> 11:19.379
If at any point you fall off the
Beam or your ball drops, you're.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.034
Out.

11:21.068 --> 11:28.034
Last person left standing wins
Immunity, safe from the vote.

11:28.068 --> 11:30.251
Losers, tribal council where
Somebody will be the ninth.

11:30.275 --> 11:31.862
Person voted out of this game.

11:31.896 --> 11:32.862
We'll draw for spots.

11:32.896 --> 11:38.310
We'll get started.

11:42.068 --> 11:42.689
All right.

11:42.724 --> 11:44.379
Here we go.

11:44.413 --> 11:49.068
Everybody plant your feet.

11:49.103 --> 11:53.448
Try the find a steady spot.

11:53.482 --> 12:01.482
Place your ball on your bow.

12:01.758 --> 12:08.275
And this challenge is on.

12:08.310 --> 12:13.620
Everybody concentrating on one
Thing, balancing a ball on a.

12:13.655 --> 12:21.655
Wooden bow while on narrow beam.

12:25.275 --> 12:26.862
A little bit of early movement.

12:26.896 --> 12:28.620
Nice correction.

12:28.655 --> 12:30.241
Devin's... devens' ball moving
Now.

12:30.275 --> 12:37.241
He has to get it back the a
Resting spot.

12:37.275 --> 12:42.344
And he's now back quiet again.

12:42.379 --> 12:48.413
Dead still hot day in fiji.

12:48.448 --> 12:50.862
Any other day this is a
Beautiful day in fiji.

12:50.896 --> 12:56.551
Right now, for some shade.

12:56.586 --> 13:02.310
Wet, dripping.

13:02.344 --> 13:07.000
Wardog with some movement.

13:07.034 --> 13:12.413
Wardog right on the edge.

13:12.448 --> 13:13.862
Wardog the first to drop.

13:13.896 --> 13:17.758
We are down to ten.

13:17.793 --> 13:20.965
After the shocked faces at the
Last tribal, pretty certain.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.413
Everybody here feels they high
Need immunity tonight.

13:27.448 --> 13:30.620
They might need immunity
Tonight.

13:30.655 --> 13:34.034
Julie with a little bit of
Movement.

13:34.068 --> 13:36.034
Julie's the second person out of
This challenge.

13:36.068 --> 13:38.172
An we are down to nine.

13:38.206 --> 13:42.413
Ten seconds left in this round.

13:42.448 --> 13:43.965
Aurora with a little bit of
Movement.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.586
Now.

13:44.620 --> 13:48.241
Gavin with more movement.

13:48.275 --> 13:52.103
Three, two, one... Everybody
Safe.

13:52.137 --> 13:53.827
Grab your balls.

13:53.862 --> 13:55.172
My god.

13:55.206 --> 14:00.241
Now we're going the
Move farther down the beam.

14:00.275 --> 14:02.965
You first have to balance on the
Most narrow part of the beam.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.068
Then you have to get the ball on
The bow.

14:05.103 --> 14:13.103
Three, two, one... And this
Challenge is back on.

14:14.137 --> 14:19.172
Very little room on that beam
For your feet.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.896
They're going to cramp quickly.

14:20.931 --> 14:24.620
Ron is struggling trying to hold
That balance.

14:24.655 --> 14:30.931
My feet are on fire.

14:30.965 --> 14:32.379
Ron is the first to drop.

14:32.413 --> 14:37.172
Ron is out.

14:37.206 --> 14:38.413
Devens with a lot of movement.

14:38.448 --> 14:41.241
, but he's keeping it alive.

14:41.275 --> 14:44.586
And right behind ron devens
Right next to help.

14:44.620 --> 14:45.689
Devens drops.

14:45.724 --> 14:46.448
Devens is out.

14:46.482 --> 14:49.034
We're down to seven.

14:49.068 --> 14:53.655
Two men left in this challenge,
Five women.

14:53.689 --> 14:56.758
Both immunitys havezódlñ been wo
Women so far this season.

14:56.793 --> 14:59.068
Will that streak continue?

14:59.103 --> 15:02.517
Aurora with a little bit of
Movement now.

15:02.551 --> 15:07.206
Aurora is out of the challenge.

15:07.241 --> 15:07.965
Victoria can't do it.

15:08.000 --> 15:08.620
She's out.

15:08.655 --> 15:16.655
We're down to five.

15:17.586 --> 15:18.034
Wow.

15:18.068 --> 15:18.862
That was fast.

15:18.896 --> 15:21.344
Lauren had no chance to recover.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.241
Lauren is out.

15:22.275 --> 15:27.517
And we're down to four.

15:27.551 --> 15:31.344
It is gavin, julia, david, and
Wentworth.

15:31.379 --> 15:33.344
David did this once.

15:33.379 --> 15:36.862
Could that be the difference
Today?

15:36.896 --> 15:37.862
That experience.

15:37.896 --> 15:40.172
Wentworth very solid.

15:40.206 --> 15:43.551
Gavin with some movement now in
That lower half of the body.

15:43.586 --> 15:47.620
Causing the ball up top to move.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.896
But another nice recovery.

15:49.931 --> 15:51.758
Come on, kel.

15:51.793 --> 15:54.448
Wentworth's ball is
On the move, but she recovers.

15:54.482 --> 15:57.137
Come on, kel.

15:57.172 --> 15:58.379
Come on, ke le.

15:58.413 --> 16:00.448
Wentworth can't
Recover this time.

16:00.482 --> 16:01.000
Wentworth is out.

16:01.034 --> 16:03.275
We are down to three.

16:03.310 --> 16:10.206
Gavin and david on the ends and
Julia in the middle.

16:10.241 --> 16:13.586
Julia still very solid.

16:13.620 --> 16:15.586
Nobody is going to give up.

16:15.620 --> 16:19.137
People are going to just give
Out.

16:19.172 --> 16:21.241
Out of nowhere julia drops.

16:21.275 --> 16:24.724
Julia had been rock solid the
Entire challenge.

16:24.758 --> 16:26.758
Now hobbling back to the bench.

16:26.793 --> 16:27.793
An we're down to two.

16:27.827 --> 16:34.034
It's a showdown, gavin versus
David.

16:34.068 --> 16:39.000
For immunity, fight right now.

16:39.034 --> 16:42.965
This is one of those moments
Where you can start to drift.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.241
You don't want the drift.

16:46.275 --> 16:49.379
Wake up.

16:49.413 --> 16:52.517
Gavin's ball takes a big move.

16:52.551 --> 16:55.413
Almost caught him off guard, but
A nice recovery.

16:55.448 --> 17:03.034
David looking very solid.

17:03.068 --> 17:04.619
David's first big movement.

17:04.655 --> 17:05.068
Has to recover.

17:05.103 --> 17:07.241
Can he?

17:07.275 --> 17:09.068
Gavin's ball still moving.

17:09.103 --> 17:13.344
David now in trouble.

17:13.378 --> 17:16.103
David can't recover.

17:16.137 --> 17:20.619
Gavin wins individual immunity,
Safe tonight at tribal council.

17:20.655 --> 17:22.103
Good job, man.

17:22.137 --> 17:23.586
Good job.

17:23.619 --> 17:24.550
What a showdown.

17:24.586 --> 17:29.655
My god.

17:29.689 --> 17:34.103
Gavin, come on over.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.493
I've been waiting for this
For a long time.

17:35.517 --> 17:35.965
Really?

17:36.000 --> 17:36.655
How long?

17:36.689 --> 17:38.379
Sentence I was about eight.

17:38.413 --> 17:41.344
Eight years old,
Watching "Survivor," dreaming of.

17:41.379 --> 17:42.310
A moment like this.

17:42.344 --> 17:43.103
Here you are.

17:43.137 --> 17:44.724
You just outlasted everybody
Else.

17:44.758 --> 17:46.000
What is it?

17:46.034 --> 17:48.758
I was thinking about watching
This with my family, you know?

17:48.793 --> 17:52.413
I can already see my mom and my
Dad and my wife and my brother.

17:52.448 --> 17:54.655
Just saying, come on, a little
Bit further.

17:54.689 --> 17:56.241
Well, it worked.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.620
Gavin immunity, safe tonight at
Tribal council.

17:58.655 --> 18:01.896
As for the rest of you, somebody
Will be the ninth person voted.

18:01.931 --> 18:02.724
Out of this game.

18:02.758 --> 18:04.379
Grab your stuff, head back to
Camp.

18:04.413 --> 18:08.344
See you tonight at tribal.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.965
I felt so accomplished
Beating david in this challenge,

18:11.000 --> 18:15.310
Because my plan was to get david
Sent home tonight, and if david.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.655
Would have won, it was the worst
Possible scenario for me.

18:18.689 --> 18:22.689
Now I can say I'm the reason
That david got sent home.

18:37.310 --> 18:37.655
Good job.

18:37.689 --> 18:39.724
Good job.

18:39.758 --> 18:41.517
Thank you.

18:41.551 --> 18:43.000
Everyone is going to go Crazy.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.482
Can I talk to you?

18:44.517 --> 18:52.068
Yeah.

18:52.103 --> 18:54.517
We cleared that out fast.

18:54.551 --> 18:55.758
Sure did.

18:55.793 --> 18:58.689
For the first time since
We've merged we get back from an.

18:58.724 --> 19:00.793
Immunity challenge and there's
No pretense.

19:00.827 --> 19:03.000
Everyone in camp scatters.

19:03.034 --> 19:06.000
David andry left in camp with
Jewela.

19:06.034 --> 19:11.103
I wanted to talk to her in that
There is a big target in kelley,

19:11.137 --> 19:12.896
Warren, and wardog.

19:12.931 --> 19:17.137
Those three have been together
Since the very beginning.

19:17.172 --> 19:21.344
They're the three that never
Voted different from each other.

19:21.379 --> 19:23.275
And then gavin comes in.

19:23.310 --> 19:24.965
I'm able to give him the same
Pitch.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.241
Those three, they have been
Together the entire game.

19:29.275 --> 19:31.379
They have never voted apart from
Each other.

19:31.413 --> 19:34.862
Then victoria...
all the lesu members are.

19:34.896 --> 19:35.586
Still here.

19:35.620 --> 19:36.700
It's like, how did that happen?

19:36.724 --> 19:38.655
So I'm strike patient.

19:38.689 --> 19:42.034
I'm trying to let them see that
What's best for all of us is to.

19:42.068 --> 19:45.241
Break up a power trio in the
Game.

19:45.275 --> 19:47.044
Meanwhile, david and I will
Probably flip a coin to see who.

19:47.068 --> 19:50.689
Gets to use the immunity idol
Tonight if we feel things aren't.

19:50.724 --> 19:52.000
Going our way.

19:52.034 --> 19:59.275
Here is my fear, that we vote
Out david, they go back to kama.

19:59.310 --> 20:01.862
For the next vote and vote one
Of us out.

20:01.896 --> 20:05.965
I think if there is a way to
Convince us to do ron over

20:06.000 --> 20:09.034
David, that's our best play,
Because that really alienates

20:09.068 --> 20:10.241
Julie.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.320
I actually wish that david
Would have won, because ron.

20:12.344 --> 20:15.310
Would be next on the chopping
Block.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.379
Ron is a strategic cal threat.

20:17.413 --> 20:21.000
He has been kind of a leader on
The kama cult for a while.

20:21.034 --> 20:22.034
And I don't trust him.

20:22.068 --> 20:23.034
Here's my thing.

20:23.068 --> 20:23.689
Okay.

20:23.724 --> 20:25.241
Ji just my thought.

20:25.275 --> 20:26.034
Yeah.

20:26.068 --> 20:30.068
David has an challenge.

20:37.551 --> 20:43.551
If you do these challenges with
Ron, I feel like aurora.

20:43.586 --> 20:44.068
Yeah.

20:44.103 --> 20:45.482
We have options.

20:45.517 --> 20:46.655
That's good.

20:46.689 --> 20:51.137
So lesu is saying that they're
Fine with the david vote.

20:51.172 --> 20:54.724
However, they keep pushing other
Option, such as ron.

20:54.758 --> 20:58.586
It makes me believe that they
Might be all working together on.

20:58.620 --> 21:00.517
The low and they're trying to
Bamboozle us.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.862
I'm not rallying for either One.

21:02.896 --> 21:04.103
I don't really care.

21:04.137 --> 21:09.000
So I much prefer to change it
Up and try to reunite kama.

21:09.034 --> 21:12.724
Strong and target the powerhouse
In this game, which is kelley.

21:12.758 --> 21:17.034
What are your thoughts on who
You think the best person to go.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.172
Home would be?

21:18.206 --> 21:20.517
I'm more for getting rid of
Either kelley or david.

21:20.551 --> 21:22.896
So are we going for kelley or
David?

21:22.931 --> 21:28.482
I would say if we're going to
It, break up the trio.

21:28.517 --> 21:30.206
I'd say get kelley out of here.

21:30.241 --> 21:34.344
There is a lesu three package
Deal and then there's dave and

21:34.379 --> 21:35.448
Devon.

21:35.482 --> 21:37.355
We want to get rid of which
Package we consider most.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.551
Dangerous first.

21:38.586 --> 21:40.665
Three is bigger than the work
And it seems that we're all.

21:40.689 --> 21:44.000
Leaning toward kelley some if we
Get rid of the queen bee, maybe.

21:44.034 --> 21:45.103
The live will fall apart.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.379
I tried to be strategic.

21:47.413 --> 21:48.827
That obviously didn't work.

21:48.862 --> 21:52.482
So I just want to be a
Passenger, and I will vote.

21:52.517 --> 21:55.103
Whoever you say, and I don't
Want to go home.

21:55.137 --> 21:58.551
So I will work with y'all an
I'll earn your trust back, and I.

21:58.586 --> 22:00.517
Will do whatever needs to
Happen.

22:00.551 --> 22:04.241
The kama group obviously is
Wanting to make ron and I feel.

22:04.275 --> 22:05.068
Really comfortable.

22:05.103 --> 22:07.620
I don't feel like y'all trust
Me.

22:07.655 --> 22:10.448
But I don't know if what
They're pitching me is really.

22:10.482 --> 22:11.137
True.

22:11.172 --> 22:12.320
I don't know who I can trust.

22:12.344 --> 22:14.517
That's what I can't stand about
This game.

22:14.551 --> 22:17.413
It's how does the paranoia ever
Go away?

22:17.448 --> 22:20.206
I don't have anything to lose
Right now, because I'm already.

22:20.241 --> 22:24.206
At such a low, and I got to
Somehow pull myself together.

22:24.241 --> 22:24.827
Fast.

22:24.862 --> 22:25.620
That's happening, soon.

22:25.655 --> 22:32.034
I need the make a move.

22:32.068 --> 22:35.655
We want to vote for kelley.

22:35.689 --> 22:37.827
David is a challenge beast.

22:37.862 --> 22:42.586
He's been in the top four every
Single time.

22:42.620 --> 22:48.068
I swear to you, you are safe
Tonight.

22:48.103 --> 22:52.034
I'm telling you, david
Tonight and this game is ours.

22:52.068 --> 22:56.172
This is theturning point, plain
And similar.

22:56.206 --> 22:59.103
Everyone wanted to blindside
Kelley.

22:59.137 --> 23:01.965
That's not what I've wanted.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.310
I've grown closer to kelley.

23:03.344 --> 23:05.379
But they shut it down, and I was
Pissed.

23:05.413 --> 23:08.206
I thought I had a vote on what
We said.

23:08.241 --> 23:16.241
But it turned into a
Dictatorship.

23:18.068 --> 23:26.068
It's pretty crispy today.

23:27.379 --> 23:30.517
Moving forward, I'm just
Trying to establish trust with.

23:30.551 --> 23:32.413
The remaining kama people.

23:32.448 --> 23:38.068
But I have developed over my
Time a survivor spidey sense.

23:38.103 --> 23:41.551
And now we find ourselves
Sitting at a dinner table and no.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.896
One is saying a word.

23:42.931 --> 23:46.758
And if no one is saying a word,
It's because there's probably.

23:46.793 --> 23:49.275
Talking about you and thinking
About you and voting you home.

23:49.310 --> 23:51.655
Tonight.

23:51.689 --> 23:54.379
There's no question that we are
Playing the idol tonight.

23:54.413 --> 23:56.379
The only question is on who?

23:56.413 --> 23:58.000
Okay.

23:58.034 --> 24:00.000
Let's talk about how we want the
Use that idol.

24:00.034 --> 24:03.379
My spidey sense says it's me.

24:03.413 --> 24:11.413
I think it's you, too.

24:38.482 --> 24:39.000
What?

24:39.034 --> 24:39.793
Did you see julia?

24:39.827 --> 24:42.068
I haven't talked to her all Day.

24:42.103 --> 24:43.310
I don't know.

24:43.344 --> 24:46.724
The kama people all day
They've been fine with me.

24:46.758 --> 24:50.034
And then julia is just going...

24:50.068 --> 24:51.758
We got the plan.

24:51.793 --> 24:53.931
Like, okay.

24:53.965 --> 24:56.000
And then aurora is just like
Sleeping.

24:56.034 --> 24:57.344
She won't talk to me.

24:57.379 --> 25:03.068
And victoria is scraping the pot
Like, doesn't want to say a.

25:03.103 --> 25:04.034
Word.

25:04.068 --> 25:06.655
Gavin comes in camp and he has
His head down.

25:06.689 --> 25:07.793
Won't look at me.

25:07.827 --> 25:10.655
Like I'm having flashbacks of
Cambodia.

25:10.689 --> 25:13.034
Like y'all have got some plan in
Motion.

25:13.068 --> 25:17.413
You're trying to make me feel
Okay.

25:17.448 --> 25:22.931
There's a good chance I'm
Getting some votes.

25:22.965 --> 25:27.241
My gut is telling me that I may
Want to play my idol.

25:27.275 --> 25:30.310
And trusting your gut in this
Game is huge.

25:30.344 --> 25:32.862
Because even the people that you
Think you can trust you can't.

25:32.896 --> 25:34.000
Always trust.

25:34.034 --> 25:39.000
And right now I'm trusting
People acting very strange.

26:03.655 --> 26:11.655
Now bring in the
Members of our jury.

26:16.862 --> 26:20.482
So there is an implicit
Agreement on "Survivor" which is.

26:20.517 --> 26:23.379
Nobody is to be trusted, and yet
Everybody will choose to trust.

26:23.413 --> 26:25.689
One or more people.

26:25.724 --> 26:30.655
It's this implied agreement that
Makes the blindside possible.

26:30.689 --> 26:34.413
So, julie, what's the feeling of
Being on the right side of a.

26:34.448 --> 26:37.517
Blindside and the wrong side of
A blindside?

26:37.551 --> 26:40.689
I was definitely on the wrong
Side of the blindside last.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.896
Tribal council, and it is not a
Good feeling.

26:42.931 --> 26:46.655
So I felt like my whole game got
Turned upside down because I.

26:46.689 --> 26:48.448
Don't trust anyone at this
Point.

26:48.482 --> 26:52.103
Aurora, what was the
Fallout from the last time, what.

26:52.137 --> 26:52.896
Appeared to be a blindside?

26:52.931 --> 26:55.965
A blindside comes with Danger.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.689
You have to not bring everyone
In, because if you do, likely.

26:58.724 --> 27:00.000
The blindside won't happen.

27:00.034 --> 27:03.103
And a lot of these people were
People that left out people the.

27:03.137 --> 27:06.310
Time before.

27:06.344 --> 27:09.482
So it's not about each move that
You're left out, it's the final.

27:09.517 --> 27:11.137
Goal that you want together.

27:11.172 --> 27:12.931
Why the reaction to
That, wardog?

27:12.965 --> 27:15.689
It sounded like, last week we
Needed to use a few people to.

27:15.724 --> 27:22.000
Take eric out, and this week we
Don't need those people some was.

27:22.034 --> 27:25.310
A passenger on their plan or a
Passenger on our plan.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.482
Wentworth, you were
Nodding in agreement.

27:27.517 --> 27:31.448
I think that was the vibe
Back at camp.

27:31.482 --> 27:35.689
I was trying to establish trust
With a group of people, however,

27:35.724 --> 27:39.172
This kama group may have gotten
Back together.

27:39.206 --> 27:41.896
So I'm not completely certain
What is going to happen tonight.

27:41.931 --> 27:46.275
David, any time you
Hear a statement followed by,

27:46.310 --> 27:50.034
"However" or "But," it means I'm
Not sure I meant anything I just.

27:50.068 --> 27:51.206
Said.

27:51.241 --> 27:53.586
It's way to give you an
Answer without blowing up your.

27:53.620 --> 28:00.379
Own game, but... This morning in
The water I spotted this huge.

28:00.413 --> 28:02.103
Pool of minnows.

28:02.137 --> 28:05.034
Eventually a shark came through
And ate a bunch of them.

28:05.068 --> 28:08.793
And tonight with the
Reconstituted kama, it's likely.

28:08.827 --> 28:11.448
That one of the lesu is a
Minnow.

28:11.482 --> 28:12.793
Did that really Happen?

28:12.827 --> 28:15.137
Yeah.

28:15.172 --> 28:20.275
It was while I was taking a
Poop, but yeah.

28:20.310 --> 28:23.551
Devens, we have a new
Analogy thanks to david.

28:23.586 --> 28:24.206
Where are you?

28:24.241 --> 28:25.586
Are you a minnow or a shark?

28:25.620 --> 28:29.344
I might be the poop at this
Point.

28:29.379 --> 28:30.965
I have no idea what's going on.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.965
There are a few people at camp
That were the hot date today,

28:34.000 --> 28:38.310
Which was gavin and aurora and
Julia and victoria.

28:38.344 --> 28:41.758
And they were going to get back
To us with an answer, and they.

28:41.793 --> 28:42.976
Intentionally let the clock run
Out.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.517
Wow, gavin, that is a very
Bold, honest statement.

28:46.551 --> 28:53.689
Yeah, I mean, that's not as
Much as I'm avoiding you and.

28:53.724 --> 28:54.976
Everybody breaking off in
Groups.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.862
You think you have a set plan,
You meet back up with your.

28:57.896 --> 28:59.044
Group, and things have changed.

28:59.068 --> 29:02.000
Julie, I have seen
Enough tribals to know that.

29:02.034 --> 29:03.448
Trust isn't what it appears to
Be.

29:03.482 --> 29:04.275
It changes.

29:04.310 --> 29:05.896
It definitely can change
Quickly.

29:05.931 --> 29:08.827
I was feeling good yesterday,
And I feel like I've hit an.

29:08.862 --> 29:10.068
All-time low today.

29:10.103 --> 29:15.482
I am physically and mentally
Drained, and I can't do it again.

29:15.517 --> 29:16.379
What's going on?

29:16.413 --> 29:18.931
I don't know.

29:18.965 --> 29:23.724
M/< feel like a lunatic for
Getting this emotional because.

29:23.758 --> 29:24.965
It's a game.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.448
There are so many other worse
Things going on in the world,

29:27.482 --> 29:31.586
But it's so much harder than I
Thought, because I don't have a.

29:31.620 --> 29:32.827
Clear mind.

29:32.862 --> 29:34.734
And then when you feel like
You've been left out in the dark.

29:34.758 --> 29:37.586
Of people that you trusted, no
Matter how much they say you can.

29:37.620 --> 29:40.310
Trust them, I don't think the
Plan I've been told is happening.

29:40.344 --> 29:41.448
Tonight.

29:41.482 --> 29:45.586
I'm sure it's another blindside
On the two of us 100%.

29:45.620 --> 29:50.000
So I just feel like, if I'm here
Tomorrow, I'm a free agent at.

29:50.034 --> 29:51.275
This point.

29:51.310 --> 29:54.310
Like I can't trust the people
That I tried to trust all along.

29:54.344 --> 29:55.482
In this game.

29:55.517 --> 29:58.137
Well, this vote will let
Julia and me know if we can.

29:58.172 --> 30:01.482
Trust the people we want to work
Work and if all goes as planned,

30:01.517 --> 30:04.275
Then julie and I will be in
Great shape and we will feel so.

30:04.310 --> 30:05.517
Much better.

30:05.551 --> 30:07.689
Two things to Address.

30:07.724 --> 30:11.068
First, one of the great things,
Julie, about survivor being in.

30:11.103 --> 30:14.034
This 38th season, is the
People that are fans of this.

30:14.068 --> 30:16.241
Show, they understand this game.

30:16.275 --> 30:19.103
There's nobody watching that
Thinks you're a lunatic because.

30:19.137 --> 30:21.689
You're exhausted after 23 days
In this game.

30:21.724 --> 30:22.931
Everyone gets it.

30:22.965 --> 30:25.586
The other fascinating thing is
That while you are crying and.

30:25.620 --> 30:29.379
Pleading your case, other people
Are almost giggling at the.

30:29.413 --> 30:30.965
Audacity of what you're saying.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.379
So julia, I know you have
Empathy for how she's feeling.

30:33.413 --> 30:34.620
Absolutely.

30:34.655 --> 30:38.137
But from a game point
Of view, what did you find so.

30:38.172 --> 30:39.424
Interesting about what she said.

30:39.448 --> 30:44.034
What I was more so giggling
At was wentworth looking over at.

30:44.068 --> 30:45.448
Me asking if we're till good.

30:45.482 --> 30:47.620
I was like, yes, that was the
Giggle.

30:47.655 --> 30:51.655
All these plans going on, and
The "Survivor" madness that is.

30:51.689 --> 30:52.931
Occurring right now.

30:52.965 --> 30:55.217
I don't know exactly what's
Going on, but I feel like julia.

30:55.241 --> 30:58.413
Gave the game away when she said
Wentworth asked if the plan was.

30:58.448 --> 30:59.586
In motion.

30:59.620 --> 31:02.724
She said, yes, I guess they're
Going with the lesu three.

31:02.758 --> 31:04.103
That seems pretty clear.

31:04.137 --> 31:06.482
Aurora, you can't
Trust anything.

31:06.517 --> 31:09.758
You don't know what wentworth
And julia are really doing, and.

31:09.793 --> 31:11.182
You're sitting on the edge
Thinking what?

31:11.206 --> 31:14.896
I love how lesu, whether
They're together or split,

31:14.931 --> 31:17.965
They're playing the game just
Like we're playing the game.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.103
We can't act like last tribal it
Didn't click with them that.

31:21.137 --> 31:23.724
Maybe they could work together
If they got over their.

31:23.758 --> 31:24.965
Differences.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.148
One side is like, we're with
You and we're going to blind.

31:27.172 --> 31:28.448
Side the other.

31:28.482 --> 31:30.907
The other is we're with you and
We're going to blind side them.

31:30.931 --> 31:33.413
What they're trying to do is
Create mistrust.

31:33.448 --> 31:37.379
Yeah, kama really gets along,
Ask eric and aubry and joe and.

31:37.413 --> 31:40.517
The two people you left out of
The last vote how well kama gets.

31:40.551 --> 31:41.734
Along and can trust each other.

31:41.758 --> 31:45.758
I didn't say you were the
Only dysfunctional.

31:45.793 --> 31:46.482
We admit it to.

31:46.517 --> 31:48.034
We're totally dysfunctional.

31:48.068 --> 31:49.172
We owned it.

31:49.206 --> 31:50.620
No one is denying that.

31:50.655 --> 31:52.758
It's very clear where lesu
Stands.

31:52.793 --> 31:56.034
It's not about generalizing each
Word in each statement.

31:56.068 --> 31:59.068
Like david was talking about how
You've got sharks and minnows.

31:59.103 --> 32:02.068
There are also other things in
The sea that are creating.

32:02.103 --> 32:07.103
Problems or making them get into
A pack to be susceptible to.

32:07.137 --> 32:07.931
Sharks.

32:07.965 --> 32:11.551
Wardog, I'm just Confused.

32:11.586 --> 32:15.103
I mean, I'm trying to get
Aurora's mindset.

32:15.137 --> 32:16.448
Nobody is blaming kama.

32:16.482 --> 32:17.896
Nobody is blaming lesu.

32:17.931 --> 32:19.793
We're all dysfunctional.

32:19.827 --> 32:21.827
She got left out of the second
Vote.

32:21.862 --> 32:23.275
She was left out of first vote.

32:23.310 --> 32:24.896
We were all left out of a vote.

32:24.931 --> 32:28.310
Just throwing this out there,
It seems like there is a really.

32:28.344 --> 32:30.931
Strong kama group that doesn't
Want us messing with them.

32:30.965 --> 32:34.655
Then we have five lesu and two
Kamas have been left out.

32:34.689 --> 32:35.931
That's seven people.

32:35.965 --> 32:38.148
We can do whatever we wanted if
Aurora really wants us to work.

32:38.172 --> 32:39.344
Together.

32:39.379 --> 32:41.758
I thought you guys were so
Dysfunctional that you would.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.034
Never work together again.

32:43.068 --> 32:46.034
So how is rick throwing out this
Plan where all of a sudden...

32:46.068 --> 32:48.172
I think aurora threw it out.

32:48.206 --> 32:49.827
I'm just on board.

32:49.862 --> 32:56.655
That'ses assanine member.

32:56.689 --> 32:58.034
You're such a passenger, rick.

32:58.068 --> 33:02.689
I feel like I just handed out
The imment p.S.

33:02.724 --> 33:05.827
I can see why julia would not
Want that.

33:05.862 --> 33:08.413
For the seven of us, we could
Get through this vote and take.

33:08.448 --> 33:12.172
The power from kama, who is
Clearly messing with all of us.

33:12.206 --> 33:15.517
Rick, you're paranoid because
You're not part of any of the.

33:15.551 --> 33:18.413
Many plans that are formed here
Tonight.

33:18.448 --> 33:21.724
If I'm not part of any of the
Plans, shouldn't I form my own.

33:21.758 --> 33:22.241
Plan, julia?

33:22.275 --> 33:23.206
Sure, go for it.

33:23.241 --> 33:24.137
Thank you.

33:24.172 --> 33:25.862
But there are many plans
Already set.

33:25.896 --> 33:28.689
So you're making a commitment
For the other lesu that you.

33:28.724 --> 33:30.862
Haven't even talked to and that
That you just...

33:30.896 --> 33:33.034
no, I'm broaching it with Them.

33:33.068 --> 33:34.389
But I think it's a great idea to
Be honest.

33:34.413 --> 33:37.551
Rick's proposal is sounding
Better and better to me right.

33:37.586 --> 33:37.965
Now.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.241
Wow.

33:39.275 --> 33:42.689
David, the smile on your face
Speaks to what I'm guessing is.

33:42.724 --> 33:45.137
There are several layers of
Story happening.

33:45.172 --> 33:47.965
Some people trying to misdirect
Some hoping this plan goes.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.034
Through.

33:49.068 --> 33:52.034
I'm actually seeing a lot of
Desperation.

33:52.068 --> 33:54.068
Look at all these conversations
That are happening.

33:54.103 --> 34:00.241
Everybody is trying the figure
Out what the hell is going on.

34:00.275 --> 34:02.517
I don't even want to
Ask a question.

34:02.551 --> 34:03.793
It's way better to watch.

34:03.827 --> 34:07.931
That's right.

34:07.965 --> 34:09.896
Here we go.

34:09.931 --> 34:12.896
It's on.

34:12.931 --> 34:17.447
I'll go aurora right now.

34:17.482 --> 34:18.793
My god.

34:18.827 --> 34:19.516
Remember me?

34:19.551 --> 34:21.827
Yes, I remember you.

34:21.862 --> 34:24.585
David?

34:24.620 --> 34:24.896
Devens?

34:24.931 --> 34:25.447
Okay.

34:25.482 --> 34:31.068
Hang on.

34:35.172 --> 34:39.757
Can I ask you guys, if I talk
Plan to all of you guys, was.

34:39.793 --> 34:40.379
That for sure?

34:40.413 --> 34:42.068
There was no... >> okay.

34:42.103 --> 34:43.516
That's what I thought.

34:43.551 --> 34:45.931
Because I'm not going to turn
On your guys.

34:45.965 --> 34:48.241
I'll be honest.

34:48.275 --> 34:53.275
You guys will have the numbers.

34:53.310 --> 34:54.137
Victoria?

34:54.172 --> 34:55.965
What?

34:56.000 --> 34:56.931
No.

34:56.965 --> 34:59.241
I'm ready for the two of us
To jump ship.

34:59.275 --> 35:01.182
The five lesu are on a journey
And the two of us will join you,

35:01.206 --> 35:06.137
Because this is so beyond...
david, it's for your game.

35:06.172 --> 35:08.241
You're not working with
Victoria.

35:08.275 --> 35:08.965
Are you not?

35:09.000 --> 35:10.379
I'm supposed to be.

35:10.413 --> 35:11.172
I hope I am.

35:11.206 --> 35:12.655
Nothing has changed.

35:12.689 --> 35:14.931
I swear to you.

35:14.965 --> 35:22.965
It look like we're not going
To have it.

35:24.758 --> 35:27.172
Julia or lauren?

35:27.206 --> 35:30.034
You tell me the name and I'll
Do it right now.

35:30.068 --> 35:31.320
There are seven of us right
Here.

35:31.344 --> 35:33.758
I love how there are seven of
Us.

35:33.793 --> 35:35.689
They're saying your name, Julia.

35:35.724 --> 35:37.827
Let's talk about it.

35:37.862 --> 35:39.758
You want to talk about my name?

35:39.793 --> 35:42.896
Too many looks all day today
That I call that you didn't.

35:42.931 --> 35:43.517
Think I caught.

35:43.551 --> 35:44.172
I'm out.

35:44.206 --> 35:45.965
I'm out.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.182
No, you know what, I've seen the
Looks.

35:47.206 --> 35:51.517
I have seen the looks, and ron
Should know not to trust it.

35:51.551 --> 35:52.344
100%...

35:52.379 --> 35:53.172
we're the only people that
Voted.

35:53.206 --> 35:54.448
What was the plan tonight.

35:54.482 --> 35:55.482
Can you tell me?

35:55.517 --> 35:55.862
It was me?

35:55.896 --> 35:57.034
Yes.

35:57.068 --> 35:57.689
Okay.

35:57.724 --> 36:00.000
Thank you for your honesty.

36:00.034 --> 36:03.137
No, no, last second I'm
Talking to people and they won't.

36:03.172 --> 36:05.206
Even tell me which one was the
Choice.

36:05.241 --> 36:08.689
I wasn't even told until the
Very end by gavin which one was.

36:08.724 --> 36:11.310
The choice tonight.

36:11.344 --> 36:13.689
Julie, julie, julie.

36:13.724 --> 36:16.103
If you want to do a plan,
Let's do plan.

36:16.137 --> 36:17.896
I want to know I can trust You.

36:17.931 --> 36:18.586
Okay.

36:18.620 --> 36:19.482
We can do something right now.

36:19.517 --> 36:21.517
Julie, really?

36:21.551 --> 36:23.655
You're about to throw away kama
Control to lesu.

36:23.689 --> 36:25.551
I don't have kama control.

36:25.586 --> 36:26.206
I'm on the bottom.

36:26.241 --> 36:27.172
We all have the control.

36:27.206 --> 36:29.241
I'm ready to jump ship.

36:29.275 --> 36:32.172
I'm ready to jump ship.

36:32.206 --> 36:34.896
I'm ready to jump ship.

36:34.931 --> 36:35.931
Are you okay?

36:35.965 --> 36:39.965
My god, she lost her damn Mind.

36:45.034 --> 36:47.517
I was left out of that vote
And I've been left out all day.

36:47.551 --> 36:49.896
Nobody approached me with any
Strategy.

36:49.931 --> 36:53.103
We had just gotten back.

36:53.137 --> 36:57.655
I can pull julie back over
Here, but don't mention that.

36:57.689 --> 37:01.620
Julie, julie, can I talk to
You, please?

37:01.655 --> 37:03.034
Wow.

37:03.068 --> 37:03.965
I heard that.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.413
Whatever, man.

37:05.448 --> 37:06.827
This is like a mess now.

37:06.862 --> 37:09.862
It's actually very clean now.

37:09.896 --> 37:12.896
I have been on kama with you
Guys since day one, and if you.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.103
Think you can trust lesu members
Moving forward...

37:15.137 --> 37:17.068
who voted with you last Tribal?

37:17.103 --> 37:18.620
You weren't even the target.

37:18.655 --> 37:21.655
Julia, I know I'm not the
Target, but guess what, I'm in.

37:21.689 --> 37:23.068
The pilot's seat.

37:23.103 --> 37:23.689
I'm trying the drive.

37:23.724 --> 37:25.827
Go ahead, drive, buddy.

37:25.862 --> 37:29.586
Drive, buddy.

37:29.620 --> 37:31.103
Wow.

37:31.137 --> 37:32.827
I have never seen anything like
It.

37:32.862 --> 37:33.551
Let's vote.

37:33.586 --> 37:38.620
Shut up, wardog.

37:38.655 --> 37:41.448
Devens, it is still
Clearly up in the air.

37:41.482 --> 37:45.137
Yeah, it's a live tribal, Jeff.

37:45.172 --> 37:46.655
It seems to be pretty live.

37:46.689 --> 37:47.862
It's the livest.

37:47.896 --> 37:49.517
This is as live as it gets.

37:49.551 --> 37:52.965
I was criticized for bringing
Up the idea, but I think I'm.

37:53.000 --> 38:00.862
Glad that I did.

38:00.896 --> 38:03.275
Everybody sat back Down.

38:03.310 --> 38:03.862
Does that mean...

38:03.896 --> 38:05.137
yes, we're ready.

38:05.172 --> 38:07.241
We are ready to vote.

38:07.275 --> 38:08.965
Let's lock it.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.241
All right.

38:11.275 --> 38:15.034
One of the single craziest
Tribals I have ever been witness.

38:15.068 --> 38:15.896
To.

38:15.931 --> 38:17.862
I cannot wait to see what comes
Of it.

38:17.896 --> 38:20.275
It is time to vote.

38:20.310 --> 38:27.310
Aurora, you're up.

38:38.206 --> 38:46.206
Well, that was one for the Ages.

38:46.241 --> 38:52.241
My god.

39:03.586 --> 39:11.586
I'll go tally the Votes.

39:12.862 --> 39:15.862
If anybody has a hidden immunity
Idol and you want the play it,

39:15.896 --> 39:20.931
Now would be the time to do so.

39:20.965 --> 39:23.724
Jeff.

39:23.758 --> 39:27.586
Just to add some excitement, and
So that there's no secrets going.

39:27.620 --> 39:30.379
Back to camp, I think david and
I would like the play a little.

39:30.413 --> 39:31.551
Something.

39:31.586 --> 39:34.655
A little insurance policy,
Just in case, on a chaotic.

39:34.689 --> 39:38.689
Night, just to make sure
Everything pays off, guys.

39:41.275 --> 39:45.827
I'd like to play this for my
Buddy david.

39:45.862 --> 39:52.448
Okay.

39:52.482 --> 39:55.620
When paired together, these two
Pieces do form one hidden.

39:55.655 --> 39:56.517
Immunity idol.

39:56.551 --> 40:01.379
Any votes cast for david will
Not count.

40:01.413 --> 40:05.620
I'll read the votes.

40:05.655 --> 40:08.000
First vote, david.

40:08.034 --> 40:11.068
Does not count.

40:11.103 --> 40:12.965
What?

40:13.000 --> 40:13.586
Kelley.

40:13.620 --> 40:16.724
That's one vote wentworth.

40:16.758 --> 40:17.275
Julia.

40:17.310 --> 40:22.310
One vote julia.

40:22.344 --> 40:22.896
Jewela.

40:22.931 --> 40:26.862
That's two votes julia.

40:26.896 --> 40:27.344
Jewela.

40:27.379 --> 40:28.137
Three votes julia.

40:28.172 --> 40:32.689
One vote wentworth.

40:32.724 --> 40:33.275
Jewela.

40:33.310 --> 40:38.034
That's four votes julia.

40:38.068 --> 40:38.689
Julia.

40:38.724 --> 40:39.965
That's five votes julia.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
One vote wentworth.

40:44.034 --> 40:47.551
Ninth person voted out and the
Sixth member of our jury, julia.

40:47.586 --> 40:48.551
That's six.

40:48.586 --> 40:51.310
That's enough, you need to bring
Me your torch.

40:51.344 --> 40:53.000
Good job, guys.

40:53.034 --> 40:56.000
Really.

41:10.275 --> 41:14.758
Julia, the tribe has Spoken.

41:14.793 --> 41:16.275
It's been such a pleasure, Guys.

41:16.310 --> 41:20.172
I know it's a game, but really,
Take care of yourself and take.

41:20.206 --> 41:21.413
Care of each other.

41:21.448 --> 41:25.103
Good luck.

41:25.137 --> 41:32.103
Thank you.

41:42.931 --> 41:46.172
If you want chance to get
Back in the game, take the torch.

41:46.206 --> 41:49.172
And get in the boat.

41:49.206 --> 41:53.206
Well let's do it.

42:04.620 --> 42:07.620
Stay tuned for scenes
From our next episode.

42:12.172 --> 42:13.172
Next time on "Survivor,".

42:14.689 --> 42:16.172
Empire rises.

42:16.206 --> 42:17.551
I want to build a six.

42:17.586 --> 42:19.758
Person alliance.

42:19.793 --> 42:20.976
Which person do you take out
Now?

42:21.000 --> 42:26.413
But with the kingdom
Together, we run the game.

42:26.448 --> 42:28.241
A monarch could fall.

42:28.275 --> 42:31.896
I think we gop
I'm ready to expect fireworks.

42:31.931 --> 42:32.586
Tonight.

42:32.620 --> 42:34.034
Tribal council was a mess.

42:34.068 --> 42:37.931
I have no idea what happened
With the vote.

42:37.965 --> 42:41.413
And now I'm this close to really
Being out of the game.

42:41.448 --> 42:45.103
So I'm definitely going to have
To fall back on my will and my.

42:45.137 --> 42:49.000
Motivation and that will be a
True test to whether or not I'm.

42:49.034 --> 42:52.000
Willing to push myself to stay
In it.
