03:10.736 --> 03:12.533
That's horrible. Yeah.

03:12.638 --> 03:14.868
Halloween's supposed to be scary.

03:14.974 --> 03:17.340
Yeah, but that is, um --

03:17.443 --> 03:19.434
Yeah, so you wear
a scary costume,

03:19.545 --> 03:22.013
not some slutty,
man-getting outfit like that.

03:22.181 --> 03:23.409
What -- what is that?

03:24.817 --> 03:26.808
Whatever. Can it, biotch.

03:26.919 --> 03:28.250
Fix my whiskers.

03:28.354 --> 03:29.685
- Slut.
- Whore.

03:29.855 --> 03:31.254
- Hussy.
- Jezebel.

03:31.357 --> 03:32.085
Tart.

03:44.037 --> 03:45.595
You've got to be kidding me.

03:45.739 --> 03:46.569
What?

03:46.673 --> 03:48.834
You can't be dressed like a cat.

03:48.942 --> 03:49.930
Why not?

03:50.109 --> 03:52.669
Because I told you
that I was gonna be a cat.

03:52.778 --> 03:55.303
She spent a long time
making those ears.

03:55.481 --> 03:56.846
I don't know why you made them.

03:56.949 --> 03:59.179
I mean, you can buy super-cute ones
at the drugstore.

03:59.285 --> 04:01.310
These were $5 or something.

04:01.487 --> 04:03.045
What? You worried Dex
is gonna be there?

04:11.431 --> 04:13.865
What's wrong with you?

04:13.967 --> 04:15.264
If you must know,

04:15.369 --> 04:18.533
I'm having...
a bit of a chafing situation.

04:18.639 --> 04:21.767
My fishnets are not doing
kind things to my Brazilian.

04:22.944 --> 04:26.243
I have some aloe vera
in the bathroom, so help yourself.

04:26.347 --> 04:27.905
Wait. Where did you go?

04:28.015 --> 04:30.643
- Clean Cheeks.
- What? They're butchers.

04:30.752 --> 04:32.618
Why didn't you just go
to the Honey Pot?

04:32.788 --> 04:34.255
'Cause Clean Cheeks
is the original.

04:34.423 --> 04:36.618
Okay. I'm sorry,
but I don't like the idea

04:36.725 --> 04:38.818
of a beautician
snapping on rubber gloves

04:38.927 --> 04:40.656
and putting hot wax
on my pink parts

04:40.829 --> 04:42.592
with a popsicle stick.

04:42.698 --> 04:45.962
Whoa! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

04:46.067 --> 04:48.228
So you're telling me you don't wax?

04:48.336 --> 04:50.930
No. It's au naturel for me.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.969
But guys like it better.

04:54.108 --> 04:55.040
You know what?

04:55.143 --> 04:57.543
Once they're close enough to notice,
they don't care.

04:57.645 --> 05:00.341
All right, so you keep
the hedge trimmers by the bed, then?

05:00.515 --> 05:02.574
Oh, no, no, wait.
You help guide them in with flares.

05:03.818 --> 05:05.217
You know what?
I'm starting to understand

05:05.319 --> 05:07.844
why you guys went as pussies
for Halloween.

05:07.955 --> 05:10.685
Cats! We're pussy cats.

05:11.092 --> 05:12.426
Okay.

05:18.733 --> 05:20.763
Trick or treat!

05:20.868 --> 05:23.803
You are the prettiest
trick-or-treaters!

05:23.905 --> 05:26.466
I have something for you.

05:27.409 --> 05:30.674
Oh, my gosh.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.872
Now, I have all kinds of sweets.

05:35.050 --> 05:38.019
Just grab a bunch.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.881
Thank you.

05:44.892 --> 05:47.520
So what are you talking about?
You were...

05:47.628 --> 05:48.458
Yeah.

05:48.563 --> 05:50.463
- Check out the fireman.
- Where?

05:50.565 --> 05:52.362
Over by the mummy.

05:52.467 --> 05:54.368
- Oh, that's a good hat.
- Yeah.

05:56.004 --> 05:57.801
I like it.

06:01.310 --> 06:02.470
Jesus.

06:02.578 --> 06:04.637
No, there's gonna be
tons of food at Angela's.

06:04.746 --> 06:06.613
Here. Take that.

06:08.752 --> 06:11.220
Hold on, now.

06:11.388 --> 06:14.118
Look at that guy.
He's got to be 15 or 16!

06:14.291 --> 06:16.589
- Oh, easily.
- They're giving him candy?

06:16.760 --> 06:18.557
- Why are they giving him candy?
- Why do you think?

06:18.662 --> 06:21.655
With that mask, he looks like
he's gonna pull a home invasion.

06:21.833 --> 06:24.301
Oh, this is so wrong.

06:26.238 --> 06:28.069
- Hey! That's mine!
- Asshole!

06:28.707 --> 06:30.106
Oh, asshole!

06:30.275 --> 06:32.209
He's going down.
That's it, buddy.

06:32.377 --> 06:33.071
Going down.

06:35.746 --> 06:37.441
- Whoo! Yes!
- I'm going down there.

06:38.048 --> 06:39.845
We -- we got him, dude.

06:39.950 --> 06:40.712
Wait for me.

06:44.455 --> 06:46.382
No costume, no candy!

06:46.490 --> 06:49.119
No costume, no candy!

06:49.294 --> 06:52.092
No costume, no candy,
motherfucker!

06:53.064 --> 06:55.123
No costume, no candy!

06:56.001 --> 06:57.059
Got that?

06:58.503 --> 06:59.292
Oh, my God.

06:59.404 --> 07:01.497
Angela and I used to sneak out
to the Broussard mansion

07:01.606 --> 07:03.039
all the time
when we were younger.

07:03.141 --> 07:06.008
She used to tell me the wildest
stories about that place.

07:06.111 --> 07:07.578
Are you sure this looks okay?

07:07.746 --> 07:11.045
Yes! God, stop worrying.
You look great.

07:11.149 --> 07:13.982
Besides, after a kamikaze or two,
you're not gonna care anyways.

07:14.085 --> 07:16.815
- I think it's an open bar.
- Really? For $10?

07:16.922 --> 07:19.652
Yep. Angela's been planning
this party forever.

07:19.824 --> 07:21.348
How long have you known her?

07:21.459 --> 07:22.949
Since high school.

07:23.061 --> 07:25.689
She was a senior.
I was a sophomore.

07:25.797 --> 07:28.765
She terrified me, but one summer
we ended up working together

07:28.866 --> 07:30.299
and got to be friends at Taco Bell.

07:30.467 --> 07:32.332
- Yeah.
- You worked at Taco Bell?

07:32.836 --> 07:34.495
That is awesome.

07:34.605 --> 07:37.540
No, seriously, one piece
of advice about Angela.

07:37.641 --> 07:39.233
Don't let her around
any guys you like.

07:39.343 --> 07:40.571
She'll go for them right away.

07:40.678 --> 07:41.804
She can't help it, though.

07:41.912 --> 07:44.143
She'll go after Dex.

07:44.249 --> 07:45.648
Even Colin.

07:47.586 --> 07:49.213
Really?

07:53.758 --> 07:56.319
All right. You can do this.

07:56.429 --> 07:58.124
It's crowded.

07:58.230 --> 07:59.993
Way too many witnesses.

08:00.099 --> 08:01.293
So, just go in there,

08:01.400 --> 08:03.129
you say, "It's great
doing business with you,"

08:03.235 --> 08:05.567
shake his hand.

08:05.705 --> 08:07.730
Piece of cake.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.307

09:01.261 --> 09:02.956
So nice to see you.

09:03.063 --> 09:04.998
Yeah. Hey.

09:05.099 --> 09:06.726
You too.

09:06.834 --> 09:08.096
How are things?

09:08.904 --> 09:13.500
Brave boy
coming into the lion's den.

09:13.676 --> 09:15.439
Are you here to see Nigel?

09:15.544 --> 09:16.704
Yeah.

09:16.879 --> 09:18.402
Is he in a good mood or not?

09:18.579 --> 09:21.844
I think he is very happy.

09:21.949 --> 09:24.713
Nigel. Colin's here.

09:28.623 --> 09:29.647
Go on.

09:41.869 --> 09:43.962
Uh, Nigel?

09:44.072 --> 09:46.974
I can, uh, come back
another time if you'd like.

09:47.076 --> 09:50.409
No. You sit the fuck down.

09:52.648 --> 09:54.878
Okay.

10:04.527 --> 10:06.222
Are you a liar?

10:06.329 --> 10:07.660
Or are you an idiot?

10:07.831 --> 10:11.028
Look, Nige.

10:11.134 --> 10:12.226
I'm sorry.

10:12.335 --> 10:14.996
No one's willing to pay
the same price anymore.

10:15.104 --> 10:16.662
That's why your cut was so low.

10:16.772 --> 10:18.603
Answer the fucking question.

10:18.707 --> 10:21.369
Are you a liar,
or are you an idiot?

10:21.477 --> 10:22.739
I'm an idiot.

10:26.182 --> 10:27.581
You're a smart guy.

10:27.751 --> 10:29.616
You went to college, right?

10:29.719 --> 10:31.949
You know anything
about economic theory?

10:32.055 --> 10:33.818
The law of supply and demand?

10:35.992 --> 10:37.892
Now...

10:37.994 --> 10:41.828
the drug supply around here
hasn't changed,

10:41.931 --> 10:43.899
and the demand --

10:44.000 --> 10:45.297
Well, we're in a city

10:45.401 --> 10:48.097
that was destroyed
by a fucking hurricane.

10:48.204 --> 10:50.001
People are desperate,
people are unhappy,

10:50.106 --> 10:51.539
they want their fucking drugs.

10:51.641 --> 10:53.165
And I can make it up to you.

10:53.343 --> 10:57.303
So there is no way
for the prices to go down.

10:57.414 --> 10:59.348

11:04.555 --> 11:07.182
Not yet.

Here's what I'm gonna supply --

11:11.761 --> 11:13.888
one last chance.

11:13.997 --> 11:16.227
Not a last chance to work for me --

11:16.332 --> 11:19.096
a last chance to work,
to eat, to fuck,

11:19.202 --> 11:20.760
to do anything else.

11:20.871 --> 11:22.805
And here's what I'm gonna demand.

11:22.907 --> 11:26.775
Twice what you usually give me
by tomorrow night.

11:26.877 --> 11:29.607

you get in a car accident,

11:29.713 --> 11:32.807
you get into some other
unforeseen fucking tragedy,

14:55.890 --> 14:59.520
I -- you know, I just, uh,
found this thing laying around.

14:59.628 --> 15:00.788
Right.

15:01.830 --> 15:03.923
Wow. I didn't know you guys
were gonna be here tonight.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.593
Yeah, yeah, you know,
we, uh, we wanted -- aah!

15:08.871 --> 15:10.133
Oh, uh, you know what?

15:10.305 --> 15:11.738
Um, I-I think there's a...

15:13.042 --> 15:14.875
...thing over there.

15:15.046 --> 15:16.741
- I-I'll catch you later.
- All right.

15:16.847 --> 15:18.280
All right.

15:18.382 --> 15:20.179
- Um...
- So, uh...

15:20.284 --> 15:22.616
I need to get another one
of these blue things.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.813
Okay. Uh, bartender,
can we get two more, please?

15:25.289 --> 15:27.383

15:28.727 --> 15:30.627

15:31.997 --> 15:33.055
Cute, isn't he?

15:33.165 --> 15:35.497
Yeah, maybe
after a couple of drinks.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.296
Oh, God. Dex is here.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.131
What is this?
The night of the exes?

15:40.305 --> 15:41.669
- Colin's here, too.
- What?

15:41.839 --> 15:43.170
- Where?
- Right there.

15:43.340 --> 15:45.069
Are you okay with that?

15:45.242 --> 15:46.402
Yeah. Sure.

15:46.577 --> 15:47.805
Really?

15:47.978 --> 15:48.945
Really.

15:49.613 --> 15:51.205
I never thought
I'd be able to say that,

15:51.315 --> 15:53.749
but, yeah, I'm fine.

15:53.851 --> 15:55.820
Well, listen, I understand
the whole bad-boy thing,

15:55.921 --> 15:58.754
but I have no idea
why you were ever with him.

15:58.924 --> 16:01.654
Oh, co-dependency,
a Mother Teresa complex,

16:01.827 --> 16:04.728
believing I could change someone
into something else.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.923
Thinking that great love
and great drama

16:07.032 --> 16:08.021
were the same thing.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.862
Oh, insecurity.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.163
Oh! And the guy can fuck.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.462
I want details.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.165
I'll give you details.
Let me find the bathroom first.

16:18.276 --> 16:19.174
- Okay.
- Okay.

Oh, my God!

18:04.017 --> 18:05.348
What's the matter?

18:05.452 --> 18:07.317
Angela set something up
in the bathroom.

18:07.421 --> 18:08.820
It scared the shit out of me.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.082
What?

18:10.190 --> 18:11.624
Come here.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.492
What?

18:20.369 --> 18:22.360
The mirror was broken.

18:22.471 --> 18:25.098
A hand came out of it at me.

18:26.941 --> 18:29.239
It's -- it's got to be a trick.

18:29.344 --> 18:32.006
There's got to be a motion sensor
or something somewhere.

18:32.113 --> 18:34.877
The glass isn't even cracked.

18:35.049 --> 18:38.644

19:13.890 --> 19:17.519
Yeah, only sick bastards like you
would come to a place like this.

19:18.528 --> 19:22.691
It's home to everything dark
and twisted in the human soul.

19:24.833 --> 19:27.961
There's a reason no one's been able
to live here in over 50 years.

19:30.072 --> 19:34.271
Now, you fuckers know the legend
of Evangeline Broussard, don't you?

19:34.377 --> 19:36.072
Well, how's this for a sick twist?

19:36.179 --> 19:38.647
This bitch invited over
the love of her life

19:38.748 --> 19:40.579

19:42.619 --> 19:45.281
lover boy and his friends
were never heard from again.

19:47.691 --> 19:49.181
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

new chapter of debauchery

Evangeline and her dark soul.

I want you doing everything hidden
so deep inside your subconscious

20:08.879 --> 20:10.938
that you don't even know
you want to do them.

a bunch of cops down there

24:55.473 --> 24:56.997
with guns and, like, pepper spray.

25:14.393 --> 25:16.520
I am here legally.
I rented this place.

25:16.628 --> 25:18.357
You didn't get a permit.

25:18.463 --> 25:19.930
Turn the power back on!

25:20.032 --> 25:22.466
I don't need a permit.
This is a private party.

25:22.634 --> 25:24.101
You were charging admission.

25:25.337 --> 25:28.795
Yes, but my business partner stole
all the door fees, so technically --

25:28.907 --> 25:30.340
And I guess that makes it okay?

25:30.442 --> 25:32.342
Don't even bother to answer that.

25:33.512 --> 25:34.809
Enjoy the cleanup, my dear.

25:52.463 --> 25:54.693
Oh, Angela.
Thank God.

25:54.799 --> 25:56.290
Why the fuck are you still here?

25:56.401 --> 25:57.834
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

25:58.003 --> 26:00.767
Does that heating grate over there
lead down to the basement?

26:00.872 --> 26:02.635
How the fuck would I know?

26:02.741 --> 26:05.209
Oh, dude.

26:05.377 --> 26:07.937
What the fuck's wrong with you?

26:12.185 --> 26:13.846
Let's do this
and get out of here.

26:13.953 --> 26:15.113
Suzanne's not here?

26:15.988 --> 26:18.115
Thought she was gonna meet us
at the car, but...

26:19.959 --> 26:20.983
Angela?

26:21.094 --> 26:23.325
Angela, I can't find the basement.

26:23.497 --> 26:25.158
Please help me.

26:25.332 --> 26:26.629
I'm sorry.

26:27.134 --> 26:28.692
Please? I'll be your best friend.

26:28.802 --> 26:29.632
Let's go.

26:29.803 --> 26:31.327
Yes! Thank you.

26:35.375 --> 26:36.841
Suzanne!

26:37.877 --> 26:39.435
I- I passed out...

26:39.545 --> 26:42.571
behind the go-go box.

26:58.799 --> 27:02.735
Tonight's turned out
to be such a disaster.

27:02.836 --> 27:05.202
Is this it?

27:05.305 --> 27:06.738
What?

27:06.840 --> 27:09.035
Seems about right.

27:12.579 --> 27:14.410
Jesus, this doesn't make any sense.

27:14.515 --> 27:15.607
I mean, aren't these pipes

27:15.716 --> 27:18.185
supposed to lead down
to a furnace or something?

27:18.286 --> 27:20.447
Just freaking dead-ends here.

27:20.555 --> 27:21.989
Hell, I don't know.

27:22.091 --> 27:24.116
I mean, they said there were
a bunch of rooms down here

27:24.226 --> 27:26.057
left over from prohibition.

27:26.162 --> 27:27.390
Really?

27:27.496 --> 27:29.726
Yeah, in fact, there's a tunnel
to the next estate over.

27:29.832 --> 27:31.492
It's pretty cool, huh?

27:31.599 --> 27:33.931
Wait a minute.

27:34.102 --> 27:35.831
Hey, Ange.

27:35.937 --> 27:37.165
Check this out.

27:37.338 --> 27:39.636
Dude, I think this is a door.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.935
What?

27:41.042 --> 27:42.566
Yeah.

27:42.677 --> 27:45.009
Here, help me
move these shelves.

27:45.113 --> 27:46.171
What?

27:46.281 --> 27:48.078
Let's get this shit off of here.

27:49.851 --> 27:53.343
Whoa! I love it.

27:53.454 --> 27:56.423
This is officially my dream house.

27:58.594 --> 28:01.859
Oh, whoa.

28:01.964 --> 28:04.432
Those aren't...

28:04.533 --> 28:06.262
They are, aren't they?

28:10.406 --> 28:14.400
What the fuck?

28:14.911 --> 28:17.607
Hey, guys! There are bodies
in the basement!

28:23.286 --> 28:25.347
You guys,
I think we should call the police.

28:25.455 --> 28:27.945
That's not gonna work.
We don't get service out here.

28:28.057 --> 28:29.820
I haven't got a text message
all night.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.415
I think I'm gonna be sick.

28:31.527 --> 28:33.290
Isn't this obvious?

28:33.395 --> 28:34.953
These have got to be
the people that disappeared

28:35.064 --> 28:36.395
from Evangeline's party.

28:36.498 --> 28:38.398
Whoa.

28:39.469 --> 28:40.358
Sweet!

28:41.738 --> 28:43.569
Oh, my God, Colin.

28:43.740 --> 28:46.607
Don't worry, Maddie.
I'm out of here.

28:47.377 --> 28:48.935
Bye, you guys.

28:52.355 --> 28:53.782
Come on, Angela.
Fess up.

28:53.884 --> 28:55.875
You set us up tonight
just like with the mirror.

28:55.986 --> 28:58.750
You guys,
this room was sealed off.

29:05.795 --> 29:08.856
Is that a gold tooth?

29:11.936 --> 29:13.961
Ooh! It bit her!

29:15.973 --> 29:17.971
Probably a reflex thing.

29:23.380 --> 29:26.110
Okay, guys.
The fucking gate is locked.

29:26.283 --> 29:29.514
Ange, please tell me
you have the goddamn keys.

29:29.619 --> 29:32.053
Um, yeah, they're --
they're upstairs in my bag.

29:32.222 --> 29:33.018
Just go grab 'em.

29:33.123 --> 29:34.853
Oh, fuck.

29:36.327 --> 29:37.851
Um, let's get out of here.

29:39.263 --> 29:40.958
I'll be right behind.

29:41.132 --> 29:42.497
It's the creepiest shit
I've ever seen.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.726
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

29:43.834 --> 29:45.301
We'll go now.
That was weird.

29:45.403 --> 29:47.234
This is just too fucking weird.

30:14.566 --> 30:16.931
Piece of shit, man!

30:17.034 --> 30:19.594
Maybe the lock's
on the other side or something.

30:19.704 --> 30:21.035
No, no. I already tried.

30:21.138 --> 30:22.628
Okay, this is no good.

30:22.807 --> 30:24.867
You know, the police probably
closed it when they left,

30:24.977 --> 30:26.740
and it must have locked
automatically.

30:27.980 --> 30:30.472
Know what we need now?
A drink.

30:30.583 --> 30:32.483
Come on. Let's go.

30:34.287 --> 30:35.879
What's going on with you?

30:36.489 --> 30:37.547
You don't want to know.

30:37.657 --> 30:39.784
I'm fucked.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.065
Stuck here all night.

30:52.171 --> 30:53.365
Is there any alcohol?

30:53.473 --> 30:54.940
Drink, drink, yes!

31:04.218 --> 31:07.483
Well, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

31:07.588 --> 31:08.885
Fuck...

31:09.056 --> 31:09.919
...this.

31:15.028 --> 31:16.996
Guess we're gonna be
spending the night.

31:17.096 --> 31:18.393
Vodka or gin?
What do you want?

31:18.498 --> 31:20.159
Thanks, bro.

31:21.534 --> 31:22.899
Guys...

31:23.069 --> 31:25.436
I got it.
The bodies in the basement...

31:25.606 --> 31:28.404
The way they're all arranged...
It's got to be black magic.

31:28.575 --> 31:30.839
Oh, come on.

31:31.011 --> 31:32.876
No, no, no. It fits perfectly
with the full story.

31:32.980 --> 31:35.471
You see, there was one survivor
left that night.

31:35.582 --> 31:37.175
Evangeline's maid.

31:37.285 --> 31:38.547
When the cops came
in the morning,

31:38.653 --> 31:40.678
they found her up in her room,
and she'd gone crazy.

31:40.789 --> 31:42.313
She wrote all kinds of shit
all over the walls --

31:42.424 --> 31:44.619
spells, story, everything.

31:49.764 --> 31:54.828
You see, Evangeline Broussard
was in love with Louis Devereaux.

31:55.404 --> 31:56.837
But he didn't love her.

31:58.007 --> 32:01.306
She was so desperate
that she turned to love spells.

32:01.911 --> 32:05.778
She started practicing
all kinds of magic, voodoo,

32:05.914 --> 32:07.472
witchcraft, hoodoo.

32:07.649 --> 32:10.846
And somehow by accident,
she got in touch with evil spirits.

32:11.019 --> 32:12.384
They tricked her.

32:12.487 --> 32:14.512
They told her if she invited Louis
and some friends over

32:14.689 --> 32:17.783
for a Halloween séance
that he'd fall in love with her.

32:18.760 --> 32:19.954
But they had other plans.

32:20.829 --> 32:22.319
Everything started fine,

32:22.430 --> 32:26.264
and then something went
very, very wrong.

32:28.736 --> 32:31.603
By the end of the night,
six people had vanished,

32:31.706 --> 32:34.334
Evangeline was dead,
and the maid had lost her mind.

32:34.442 --> 32:36.410
All because of the evil spirits.

32:40.648 --> 32:42.138
That's what the maid said.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.012
But you know what?

32:43.118 --> 32:45.177
Evangeline probably
just butchered them.

32:45.988 --> 32:48.513
Or sacrificed them.

32:48.691 --> 32:49.953
Let me hit that.

32:50.059 --> 32:51.356
Yeah. Sure.

32:51.527 --> 32:54.894
I don't know what else
we're gonna do all night.

32:59.734 --> 33:02.259
Hey, are you okay?

33:02.437 --> 33:04.268
Angela, you don't look so good.

33:04.439 --> 33:05.599
Skeleton bite.

33:05.773 --> 33:08.708
Come on!
It's not a skeleton bite.

33:10.478 --> 33:11.809
I'm sorry.

33:11.913 --> 33:14.007
I- I think I need to find a bathroom.

33:20.689 --> 33:21.417
Hey.

33:22.358 --> 33:24.383
Totally weird.

34:27.759 --> 34:30.125
You're all playing games?

34:30.896 --> 34:31.862
Good.

34:32.030 --> 34:33.520
- Come on.
- Join us.

34:33.699 --> 34:35.030
Yeah.

34:35.766 --> 34:38.668
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

34:38.770 --> 34:40.670
7.

34:40.772 --> 34:42.534
Perfect.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.143
All right.
You're up.

34:47.246 --> 34:48.438
- My turn?
- Yep.

34:55.186 --> 34:55.811
Yes!

34:55.920 --> 34:58.480
Oh, you're excited
about two girls kissing?

34:58.589 --> 35:00.318
That's so predictable.

35:00.424 --> 35:02.450
Yeah, Lily, it's also eternally great.

35:04.329 --> 35:06.160
I wish you didn't look so stupid.

35:06.265 --> 35:07.789
Well, at least my boobs
aren't hanging out.

35:08.667 --> 35:10.828
- Slut.
- Come here.

35:12.004 --> 35:14.472
Yeah!

35:14.640 --> 35:16.074
Yeah!

35:19.879 --> 35:22.279
Yuck! You taste all boozy!

35:22.448 --> 35:25.349
God, you know
what really sucks, man?

35:25.518 --> 35:27.145
There's fucking dead bodies
downstairs,

35:27.253 --> 35:29.016
and you guys are playing
fucking spin the bottle.

35:29.122 --> 35:32.251
Yeah, well, light as a feather,
stiff as a board comes next.

35:32.426 --> 35:34.018
And I don't think
the bodies are going anywhere.

35:34.194 --> 35:35.456
You know,
they've probably been there

35:35.562 --> 35:37.928
since before our parents
were born, so...

35:38.098 --> 35:41.124
Fuck it. I can't get out.

35:41.235 --> 35:43.293
So Nigel can't get in, right?

35:43.403 --> 35:46.463
Come on, Colin.

35:46.572 --> 35:48.836
- Uh... I'm up?
- Yep.

35:54.647 --> 35:56.878
- Oh, my --
- I want to see some guy-on-guy.

35:57.051 --> 35:59.178
- No way.
- Come on! Fair is fair.

35:59.286 --> 36:00.514
Whatever. You're chicks.

36:00.621 --> 36:02.316
You can get away with it.
It's different if you're a guy.

36:02.423 --> 36:03.549
That's a good point.

36:03.657 --> 36:05.147
Oh, what are you, homophobic?

36:05.259 --> 36:06.851
- Oh, shut up.
- Rules are rules.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.860
- Come on. Just do it.
- Your turn. Pucker up.

36:08.962 --> 36:11.760
Like a band aid.
Just do it. Come on.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.389
- Come on.
- Whatever.

36:13.567 --> 36:14.329
Whip it out.

36:14.435 --> 36:16.528
Whatever. Fine. Fine.
On 3.

36:19.106 --> 36:21.006
1...

36:22.843 --> 36:24.675
2...

36:25.347 --> 36:26.245
21/2...

36:26.414 --> 36:27.581
Oh, come on!

36:27.649 --> 36:29.278
Let's go.

36:29.385 --> 36:30.613
Shit.

36:30.786 --> 36:32.515
- Come on.
- Go.

36:32.688 --> 36:34.519
3.

36:37.625 --> 36:39.388
No tongue?

36:39.561 --> 36:42.928
Congratulations.
You are officially gay.

36:49.237 --> 36:52.400
I'm gonna dinghy myself.

37:02.250 --> 37:04.081
Oh, shit.

37:04.185 --> 37:06.279
I swear, I didn't --

37:14.230 --> 37:14.958
Yeah!

37:17.566 --> 37:18.698
Dex?

37:21.505 --> 37:24.139
You and I need
to go have a talk.

37:24.241 --> 37:25.868
Yeah, sure.

37:34.350 --> 37:37.012
So... you're a good kisser.

37:38.921 --> 37:42.152
You have no idea.

37:43.859 --> 37:45.451
Dex, I'm really --

37:45.561 --> 37:46.620
I am so sorry.

37:46.730 --> 37:50.222
I don't mean to get jealous.
It's just --

37:50.333 --> 37:54.292
Oh. What's wrong?

37:54.404 --> 37:55.428
I just got this...

37:58.542 --> 38:00.373
Are you okay?

38:00.477 --> 38:02.445
It's hot.

38:18.663 --> 38:20.824
Come over here.

38:21.399 --> 38:23.492
I can make you feel better.

38:56.602 --> 39:00.060
It sucks that the party
got shut down, Ange.

39:01.073 --> 39:03.234
Drink.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.939
I think that's a little much
for just me.

39:12.551 --> 39:15.247
Drink. I want to get lucky.

39:16.321 --> 39:17.879
Oh, my God.
This fucking blows.

39:17.990 --> 39:20.584
There's got to be another gate
somewhere, right?

39:21.360 --> 39:22.690
Nope.

39:23.327 --> 39:26.592
Looks like you're staying here
tonight.

39:26.764 --> 39:28.254
Oh, yeah.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.128
Yeah, Colin.

39:33.305 --> 39:35.206
There probably is
another gate somewhere.

39:35.308 --> 39:36.775
Why don't we go look for it?

39:36.876 --> 39:38.901
Yeah, I think you're right.

39:39.012 --> 39:40.206
- Okay.
- Would you -- ?

39:40.313 --> 39:41.143
Sorry.

39:56.863 --> 39:59.161
Hello.

40:07.007 --> 40:08.133
Want some?

40:09.310 --> 40:11.039
Sure.

40:24.757 --> 40:26.748
Okay.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.828
Um, you know what?
I'm just -- uh...

40:36.003 --> 40:39.734
Uh, wait up, guys.
I'm -- I'm coming with you.

41:28.223 --> 41:29.451
Baby?

41:29.557 --> 41:32.185
Baby, whoa, if you're gonna
put it in there,

41:32.293 --> 41:34.124
you're gonna need to use
one of those --

41:36.865 --> 41:37.957
What was that?

41:38.066 --> 41:39.761
I think it was over in those bushes.

41:39.868 --> 41:42.029
No. It came from the house.

41:42.137 --> 41:45.038
It's just the stereo, guys. Chill.

41:45.140 --> 41:47.267
God.

42:03.526 --> 42:07.825
<i>¶ She's in love with herself ¶</i>

42:09.297 --> 42:11.322
<i>¶ She likes the dark ¶</i>

42:15.236 --> 42:19.901
<i>¶ On her milk-white neck ¶</i>

42:20.776 --> 42:24.177

42:26.549 --> 42:30.508

42:32.521 --> 42:35.219

43:28.280 --> 43:29.872
I'm -- I'm sorry.

43:30.048 --> 43:33.017
Ange, I think I've had
a little too much to drink.

43:33.185 --> 43:35.210
No, you didn't.

43:37.089 --> 43:41.355
<i>¶ You can't go out
'cause your roots are showing ¶</i>

43:41.460 --> 43:43.655

43:46.298 --> 43:48.061
I'm sorry, Ange. I --

<i>¶ Loving you ¶</i>

43:56.374 --> 43:59.832
<i>¶ Loving you ¶</i>

44:12.991 --> 44:15.824
I should've stayed, man.
She was all over me.

44:15.928 --> 44:16.986
Who -- Angela?

44:17.095 --> 44:18.824
Dude, she was all over everyone,
brother.

44:18.931 --> 44:21.900
What was I thinking?
I could've fucked her.

44:23.703 --> 44:24.635
Shit.

44:24.737 --> 44:26.432
So, how has everything been?

44:26.539 --> 44:30.031
I don't know, man.
Same old shit, different day.

44:30.143 --> 44:31.610
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:31.711 --> 44:33.008
Are you seeing anyone?

44:33.746 --> 44:35.213
Oh, me?

44:35.315 --> 44:36.112
No.

44:36.851 --> 44:39.979
My life is way too fucked up
for that shit right now, man.

44:40.154 --> 44:41.781
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, definitely.

44:41.889 --> 44:42.685
Okay.

44:42.790 --> 44:45.281
There's no other gate, guys.

44:47.695 --> 44:51.095
Face it. There's no other exit.
We've been around it twice.

44:51.197 --> 44:53.028
That doesn't fucking
make any sense, man.

44:53.132 --> 44:55.794
Isn't that against, like,
fire codes or some shit?

44:55.902 --> 44:58.029
This place is 150 years old.

44:58.137 --> 45:01.106
I don't think they cared
about fire codes.

45:01.207 --> 45:03.972
People were fucking stupid
150 years ago.

45:16.657 --> 45:19.387
I got to take a piss.
I'll be right back.

45:42.418 --> 45:44.180
- Want some help with that?
- Fuck.

45:44.286 --> 45:46.186
Lily! Sorry.

45:46.354 --> 45:49.812
I- I didn't know you were in here.

45:51.993 --> 45:54.461
Mm, it's all right.

46:01.503 --> 46:05.166
Fix my whiskers?

46:07.275 --> 46:09.266
With this?

46:12.915 --> 46:15.679
Lily... you okay?

46:16.218 --> 46:17.685
Stoned or something?

46:22.525 --> 46:26.018
Fix my whiskers.

46:31.335 --> 46:32.597
O- okay.

46:36.673 --> 46:37.833
No.

46:38.008 --> 46:40.066
Not there, silly.

46:44.780 --> 46:46.179
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:46.282 --> 46:47.476
W- wait a sec.

46:47.583 --> 46:50.245
Uh, what about Dex?

47:03.233 --> 47:04.564
What the...

47:05.836 --> 47:08.134
...fuck?

47:36.900 --> 47:39.232
- Well, that took a while.
- Yeah.

47:40.170 --> 47:44.106
Dude, there is some freaky stuff
in this book.

47:44.207 --> 47:45.105
Freaky.

47:46.143 --> 47:47.475
Yeah.

47:47.578 --> 47:50.069
Uh, Lily, she, uh...

47:50.181 --> 47:53.116
Oh, God. Did Lily and Dex
get into a fight?

47:53.284 --> 47:55.718
Is she into magic?

47:55.887 --> 47:57.479
Or -- or anything?

47:57.588 --> 48:01.923
You know, like sleight of hand
and stuff?

48:02.528 --> 48:03.552
No.

48:03.729 --> 48:05.594
No. Okay.

48:05.697 --> 48:07.892
Uh, she...

48:08.600 --> 48:10.864
There might be something wrong
with her, then.

48:10.969 --> 48:12.994
What? What do you mean?

48:13.105 --> 48:16.438
Uh, she's acting, um...

48:16.608 --> 48:19.099
She -- she sort of took her --
her shirt off.

48:19.278 --> 48:21.678
There w-- there was, um --
there was blood.

48:21.847 --> 48:23.371
- And, uh...
- What?

48:23.549 --> 48:26.313
You know what? You know what?
I- I don't want to talk about it.

48:26.418 --> 48:27.715
Well, is she hurt?

48:27.820 --> 48:28.843
I- I don't know.

48:28.953 --> 48:30.420
Uh, I-I saw...

48:30.521 --> 48:32.284
Um, I-I saw, uh...

48:32.390 --> 48:34.119
What?! What did you see?

48:34.959 --> 48:40.262
She stuck a lipstick in her boob,
and it fell out of her pussy!

48:40.365 --> 48:41.297
Okay?!

48:46.439 --> 48:47.770
She was, uh...

48:47.874 --> 48:50.035
I swear she was right here.

48:50.210 --> 48:51.677
Well, where's the blood?

48:51.778 --> 48:54.611
It was on the floor.
It was -- it was everywhere.

48:54.714 --> 48:55.840
Right.

48:55.949 --> 48:58.747
Okay, I'm out of here.

48:58.852 --> 49:01.013
Dude, you're freaking seeing shit.

49:01.121 --> 49:02.486
She was, uh...

49:04.424 --> 49:06.358
Lily?

49:10.965 --> 49:13.024
Lily?

49:20.341 --> 49:22.536
Lily!

49:27.247 --> 49:29.977
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

49:30.083 --> 49:32.210
Suzanne?

49:32.318 --> 49:34.286
What?

49:35.355 --> 49:37.881
Suzanne what?

49:51.740 --> 49:52.468
Shit!

50:00.649 --> 50:02.549
Maddie!

50:06.822 --> 50:08.551
Ohh! Get away from me!

50:17.899 --> 50:18.593
Go!

50:19.434 --> 50:20.662
Shit!

50:20.835 --> 50:22.166
Fuck!

50:22.637 --> 50:23.763
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

50:25.073 --> 50:26.734
What the fuck was that?!

50:26.908 --> 50:28.341
- Shit!
- Go, go, go, go!

50:32.047 --> 50:34.572
Go, go! Fuck!

50:36.251 --> 50:37.445
Shit!

50:38.720 --> 50:41.154
Holy fucking crap.

50:41.323 --> 50:43.188
What the fuck were they, man?
Ange and Suzanne?

50:43.291 --> 50:45.657
That wasn't Suzanne.
Suzanne has a fucking face!

50:45.760 --> 50:47.625
Angela had fucking horns!

50:50.632 --> 50:51.428
Fuck.

50:51.533 --> 50:54.366
I stabbed it with a poker
all the way through,

50:54.536 --> 50:55.628
and it didn't do anything.

50:55.737 --> 50:57.295
- Shh!
- What the fuck were they?

50:57.405 --> 50:58.600
I stabbed it with a poker!

50:58.708 --> 51:00.642
Would you shut the fuck up
about the goddamn poker?

51:00.743 --> 51:04.270
Guys, guys, we have to get
the fuck out of here now!

51:04.447 --> 51:06.176
There's no way out.
The fucking gate is locked.

51:06.282 --> 51:08.216
No, no, no. Remember
fucking Angela said something

51:08.317 --> 51:10.012
about a fucking tunnel
that leads out of here?

51:10.119 --> 51:11.950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where is that?

51:12.054 --> 51:13.748
I don't fucking know, man.
Fuck!

51:13.855 --> 51:15.982
Maybe we should try
the fucking basement.

51:16.091 --> 51:18.525
Yeah. Okay.

51:20.061 --> 51:23.087
Careful. Be fucking careful.

51:25.467 --> 51:27.698
Okay, I think it's clear.
I think it's clear.

51:27.803 --> 51:29.430
Okay. You go first.

51:29.538 --> 51:31.403
- What?
- Go.

51:32.375 --> 51:33.899
Just go.

51:46.391 --> 51:48.518
I don't see anything.

51:49.294 --> 51:51.353
Let's go. Let's go.

51:53.666 --> 51:54.860
Think they got Lily, too?

51:54.967 --> 51:56.764
It's like they're just playing
with us.

51:56.869 --> 51:57.995
What do they want?
One attacked us.

51:58.103 --> 51:59.263
The other just stood there.

51:59.371 --> 52:01.771
Dude, why the hell are you being
so goddamn logical?

52:01.874 --> 52:04.502
None of this
makes any fucking sense!

52:06.645 --> 52:09.374
Get something to fight them with.

52:21.393 --> 52:22.621
I'm sorry.

52:32.037 --> 52:33.504
Check it out. Check it out.
Check it out.

52:33.672 --> 52:35.333
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

52:36.542 --> 52:38.066
Do you think it works?

52:38.543 --> 52:39.870
You're a drug dealer.

52:40.045 --> 52:41.535
Aren't you supposed to know
shit like that?

52:41.647 --> 52:44.343
You guys, we have to go.
We have to find the tunnel!

52:46.885 --> 52:49.149
Bitch.

52:49.288 --> 52:51.779
- It looks like it's in okay shape.
- How do you know?

52:52.058 --> 52:53.125
Paintball.

53:00.632 --> 53:02.223
Go, go, go, go, go!

53:02.400 --> 53:03.731
- Where is it?
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

53:03.901 --> 53:05.596
The fucking door! Please.

53:05.970 --> 53:07.528
Hurry. Hurry!

53:10.141 --> 53:11.403
Oh, fuck.

53:11.509 --> 53:14.034
Oh, man.
What the fuck, man?!

53:14.145 --> 53:16.273
There's no fucking tunnel
down here!

53:16.382 --> 53:18.111
You led us
into a fucking deathtrap!

53:18.283 --> 53:20.547
Dude, I'm sorry, okay?
I was reacting on instinct.

53:20.652 --> 53:22.677
Wait, you guys, why are there
only two skeletons?

53:22.788 --> 53:23.846
Weren't there six before?

53:23.956 --> 53:24.945
What?

53:25.157 --> 53:28.217
Dude, it's a fucking dead end.
Man, we're looking for a tunnel.

53:28.327 --> 53:32.196
A way out, as opposed
to this fucking stuck in a closet.

53:32.365 --> 53:33.992
It's not a closet!
It's a fucking pantry!

53:34.100 --> 53:34.794
Guys!

53:34.934 --> 53:37.300
Maybe if "pantry" is French
for "fucking deathtrap"!

53:37.404 --> 53:40.032
Guys, will you shut the fuck up
and look down?!

53:46.680 --> 53:47.669
Yeah.

53:48.015 --> 53:49.505
- God!
- Okay.

54:00.193 --> 54:01.785
Okay.

54:16.910 --> 54:17.642
Okay!

54:39.401 --> 54:40.732
I've got this, okay?

54:40.836 --> 54:43.397
You go first.
You've got the gun.

54:48.344 --> 54:49.436
Let's do it.

54:49.545 --> 54:51.603
Let's go.

55:11.299 --> 55:13.233
Can't you see
how far down it goes?

55:13.368 --> 55:16.565
Dude, I can't see a freaking thing.

55:38.695 --> 55:40.993
- No. No way.
- What?

55:41.164 --> 55:42.324
Oh, shit.

55:42.499 --> 55:44.558
Another fucking dead end.

55:44.735 --> 55:46.565
I thought this was the way out.

55:46.669 --> 55:49.263
It's supposed to be, man.

55:49.438 --> 55:51.531
It looks like this just happened.

55:51.707 --> 55:53.470
Please, can we get out of here?

55:54.277 --> 55:56.905
Okay. We got to go back.

56:07.891 --> 56:11.258
Bring the light over here.
Come on.

56:11.361 --> 56:12.658
Can you see?

56:12.829 --> 56:14.194
Yeah.

56:23.006 --> 56:23.836
Jason!

56:30.882 --> 56:32.281
Shit!

56:32.383 --> 56:34.180
They're on the ceiling!

56:35.587 --> 56:39.523
Out! Get out! Get out!
We have to get out!

56:51.435 --> 56:53.198
Oh, fuck!

56:55.607 --> 56:56.505
Coming!

56:56.674 --> 56:58.164
Give me that!

57:11.890 --> 57:12.857
What the hell?!

57:21.934 --> 57:23.333
Go! Go!

57:45.991 --> 57:47.288
Come on. Come on!

57:49.996 --> 57:51.293
Go, go!

57:51.398 --> 57:52.763
Go to the ladder!

57:54.367 --> 57:56.062
Shit.

57:58.838 --> 58:00.304
Hurry up!

58:03.076 --> 58:04.805
- Come on!
- Shut it!

58:04.911 --> 58:06.879
Shut the door!

58:08.581 --> 58:09.605
Lock it!

58:13.853 --> 58:14.877
Come on, Maddie!

58:15.055 --> 58:16.887
- Please!
- I'm trying!

58:26.467 --> 58:27.593
Oh, my God!

58:27.768 --> 58:29.030
Oh, did you see those things?!

58:29.136 --> 58:32.866
Yeah, dude! The bullets
didn't do a damn thing, man!

58:32.972 --> 58:35.167
Rust, the rust -- it did something.
Did you notice that?

58:35.275 --> 58:36.970
Their skin, it was like... ssss!

58:37.711 --> 58:39.702
- Aah!
- Oh, God, no!

59:10.312 --> 59:11.177
Fuck!

59:22.859 --> 59:24.052
Come on!

59:25.060 --> 59:25.685
Come on!

59:32.734 --> 59:34.167
Come on!

59:44.646 --> 59:46.705
Come on! Keep going!

59:49.251 --> 59:51.481
Go, go, go, go!

01:00:00.162 --> 01:00:01.754
Where are they?

01:00:02.463 --> 01:00:03.460
Move!

01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:08.468
Hey, how's your leg?

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:10.162
It fucking hurts!

01:00:10.339 --> 01:00:12.034
Hey!
We have to put pressure on it.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.110
Okay.

01:00:19.214 --> 01:00:22.149
- Ohh, fuck, Maddie!
- Sorry. Sorry.

01:00:22.317 --> 01:00:25.150
- Ohh, fuck!
- Sorry.

01:00:27.522 --> 01:00:28.682
Hey, guys.

01:00:30.225 --> 01:00:32.421
What is this?

01:01:00.693 --> 01:01:01.921
Wow.

01:01:03.128 --> 01:01:05.722
That is a lot of text.

01:01:05.831 --> 01:01:06.991
What's it say?

01:01:07.099 --> 01:01:09.124
I don't know.

01:01:10.169 --> 01:01:11.761
I think it starts here.

01:01:11.937 --> 01:01:14.097
These symbols are spells.

01:01:14.205 --> 01:01:16.173
We're safe if we stay in this room.

01:01:16.274 --> 01:01:18.572
They can't come in here.

01:01:20.011 --> 01:01:23.970
Apparently, those things
that got Lily and the others...

01:01:24.082 --> 01:01:25.777
are demons.

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:29.079
They're "treacherous tricksters,
"imps of the perverse."

01:01:29.188 --> 01:01:31.713
"They delight in deception
and revel in lies,

01:01:31.824 --> 01:01:33.155
spreading depravity" --

01:01:33.259 --> 01:01:36.558
Uh, okay.
So, they're demons.

01:01:37.596 --> 01:01:40.064
What the hell do they want?

01:01:40.232 --> 01:01:42.996
Death, chaos.

01:01:43.102 --> 01:01:45.935
They want to turn our world
into hell's playground.

01:01:46.105 --> 01:01:49.472
You know,
sun as dark as sackcloth,

01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:53.204
lakes of liquid fire, plagues,
the dead walking the earth,

01:01:53.312 --> 01:01:55.303
that kind of thing.

01:01:55.414 --> 01:01:57.541
Yeah.

01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:59.811
But first, they need to be freed.

01:02:00.386 --> 01:02:01.944
Okay, you guys.

01:02:02.121 --> 01:02:03.315
This is gonna sound crazy,

01:02:03.422 --> 01:02:08.120
but eons ago,
these demons defied divine law

01:02:08.226 --> 01:02:10.490
and tried to take the place
of the devil.

01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:12.219
As a punishment,

01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:14.958
they were bound together
and cast out of hell.

01:02:16.334 --> 01:02:19.030
But there's always a loophole.

01:02:19.137 --> 01:02:21.868
If demons could possess
seven people

01:02:21.974 --> 01:02:24.408
over the course
of one Halloween night,

01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:27.035
they'd be free.

01:02:27.146 --> 01:02:29.637
And that's where
Evangeline came in.

01:02:34.153 --> 01:02:36.122
When she was practicing spells,

01:02:36.222 --> 01:02:38.315
these were the demons
she contacted.

01:02:39.492 --> 01:02:42.689
They tricked her into inviting
people over for a séance.

01:02:42.862 --> 01:02:45.956
The demons just needed
seven bodies,

01:02:46.132 --> 01:02:48.726
and as soon as the ritual started,

01:02:48.902 --> 01:02:51.064
they started possessing people.

01:02:51.172 --> 01:02:53.333
Once one person had turned,

01:02:53.507 --> 01:02:55.532
all they had to do
was kiss or bite someone

01:02:55.643 --> 01:02:58.203
to possess all the rest as well.

01:02:58.379 --> 01:03:01.177
Soon, six people turned into demons.

01:03:01.282 --> 01:03:03.181
And they only needed one more.

01:03:04.317 --> 01:03:06.547
But they can't use a dead body,

01:03:06.653 --> 01:03:09.486
only a living one.

01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:12.888
So when Evangeline realized
she wouldn't make it till dawn...

01:03:19.633 --> 01:03:22.227
...she killed herself

01:03:22.336 --> 01:03:26.238
to keep the demons from getting out.

01:03:27.842 --> 01:03:29.833
So...

01:03:29.944 --> 01:03:32.412
There it is.

01:03:32.513 --> 01:03:36.506
Um... I don't understand something.

01:03:36.617 --> 01:03:39.780
What kind of demon
gets cast out of hell?

01:03:39.887 --> 01:03:41.218
These ones.

01:03:41.856 --> 01:03:43.414
They were bad-ass.

01:03:43.591 --> 01:03:46.254
They couldn't even follow
hell's rules.

01:03:46.361 --> 01:03:50.162
So... we're the only thing
standing between them

01:03:50.266 --> 01:03:52.427
and the end of the world.

01:03:52.535 --> 01:03:54.400
- That's awesome.
- Yep.

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:55.935
And Jason was right.

01:03:56.105 --> 01:03:58.265
They really don't like
the rusted iron.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.634
Yes.

01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:01.974
Told you.

01:04:02.077 --> 01:04:04.841
Well, come on.
I mean, that's completely random.

01:04:04.946 --> 01:04:06.470
No, not really.

01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:08.742
Demons are made
from ancient elements.

01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:11.978
Iron's an ancient element.
Rust corrupts it.

01:04:12.154 --> 01:04:16.921
So, you put the two together,
and demons don't like it.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.427
That makes sense.

01:04:19.528 --> 01:04:22.964
Well, whether I want
to believe this or not,

01:04:23.065 --> 01:04:27.025
I mean, these bastards
want to kill us, right?

01:04:27.136 --> 01:04:30.105
So, we don't really have any choice.

01:04:30.273 --> 01:04:31.900
Yeah.

01:04:32.008 --> 01:04:34.806
They only have tonight.
Halloween.

01:04:35.912 --> 01:04:37.607
It gets light at 6:00.

01:04:38.816 --> 01:04:41.148
We wait until dawn.

01:06:52.418 --> 01:06:55.479
Guys! Wake up!

01:06:56.022 --> 01:06:57.717
Wake up!

01:07:07.968 --> 01:07:11.768
You know, I-I didn't -- I didn't...

01:07:13.306 --> 01:07:15.206
Holy shit!

01:07:17.911 --> 01:07:19.606
You can't come in here.

01:07:19.779 --> 01:07:23.477
The spells on the walls
keep you out.

01:07:27.021 --> 01:07:28.818
Oh, there are ways.

01:07:30.358 --> 01:07:32.451
There are always ways.

01:07:42.669 --> 01:07:44.728
You still have a thing
for him, don't you?

01:07:46.873 --> 01:07:48.465
I have a thing for him, too.

01:07:49.276 --> 01:07:51.745
I'm gonna poke
his pretty brown eyes out

01:07:51.912 --> 01:07:52.901
and fuck his brains out

01:07:53.014 --> 01:07:55.141
until they're spilling
out of his ears.

01:07:55.249 --> 01:07:58.184
And right before
he takes his last gasp,

01:07:58.286 --> 01:08:01.187
right before he becomes one of us...

01:08:01.989 --> 01:08:04.584
...he shall know the place

01:08:04.693 --> 01:08:09.858
where ecstasy and suffering
become one.

01:08:10.032 --> 01:08:11.465
Shut up, bitch.

01:08:12.634 --> 01:08:13.992
Oh, shit, I'm awake. I'm awake.

01:08:14.003 --> 01:08:16.066
- What was that?
- Angela.

01:08:17.506 --> 01:08:19.805
We were right about the spells.
She couldn't get in.

01:08:19.908 --> 01:08:21.877
- Oh.
- Angela was here?

01:08:21.978 --> 01:08:24.002
But it's okay. We're safe.

01:08:24.113 --> 01:08:26.081
How's your leg?

01:08:26.182 --> 01:08:28.742
It's okay.
She was just fucking with us.

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:30.546
I think I'll live.

01:08:30.719 --> 01:08:33.745
I don't feel so good, though.

01:08:33.854 --> 01:08:35.982
Can l... get you water
or something?

01:08:36.091 --> 01:08:37.649
No, I'm okay.

01:08:37.759 --> 01:08:38.850
Guys.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.359
Guys?

01:08:41.462 --> 01:08:45.661
Is it my imagination,
or is it getting light out?

01:08:48.002 --> 01:08:49.129
Yeah.

01:08:50.772 --> 01:08:52.363
It's gonna be morning soon.

01:08:53.008 --> 01:08:54.600
Thank God.

01:08:54.776 --> 01:08:56.868
Oh, hey.

01:08:56.978 --> 01:09:01.711
So, we just, like,
sit around here one more hour,

01:09:01.817 --> 01:09:03.307
and then we're golden.

01:09:03.417 --> 01:09:06.011
Yeah.
I think we're home free.

01:09:06.121 --> 01:09:07.520
Yeah.

01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:09.350
We rock! We did it!

01:09:11.292 --> 01:09:14.194
Yes! We kicked their asses.

01:09:15.198 --> 01:09:15.892
Yeah!

01:09:16.064 --> 01:09:17.430
Yeah!

01:09:18.134 --> 01:09:19.158
Uh, guys?

01:09:21.203 --> 01:09:22.102
The walls.

01:09:27.442 --> 01:09:29.410
Shit.

01:09:29.578 --> 01:09:31.671
Is that blood?

01:09:33.615 --> 01:09:35.707
But they can't get in, right?

01:09:35.817 --> 01:09:37.307
You said they can't get in.

01:09:40.423 --> 01:09:42.152
It's washing away all the symbols.

01:09:43.426 --> 01:09:44.791
Oh, my God.

01:09:47.997 --> 01:09:48.827
Oh, shit!

01:09:51.567 --> 01:09:53.002
They're coming in here!

01:09:53.104 --> 01:09:55.299
We gotta put 'em back!
Put the symbols back up there!

01:09:55.473 --> 01:09:56.838
We have nothing to write with!

01:09:56.941 --> 01:09:57.999
A pen! We need a pen!

01:09:58.109 --> 01:10:00.236
I don't have a fucking pen! Fuck!

01:10:03.882 --> 01:10:04.780
Any luck?

01:10:04.949 --> 01:10:05.938
No!

01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:08.713
Ah! Ah! Charcoal! Charcoal!

01:10:29.441 --> 01:10:31.432
We have to keep going!

01:11:12.347 --> 01:11:14.047
Oh, my God!

01:11:14.153 --> 01:11:16.177
It worked. It worked!

01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:25.662
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:27.855
What a nightmare.

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:32.534
I think it's over.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.570
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

01:11:36.175 --> 01:11:38.166
I think they're gone.

01:11:38.344 --> 01:11:40.574
- Oh.
- I don't know.

01:11:40.746 --> 01:11:42.647
Do you really think so?

01:11:42.816 --> 01:11:44.249
I don't know.

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:52.415
We made it.

01:11:52.726 --> 01:11:53.621
Yeah.

01:11:57.064 --> 01:11:58.827
I'm gonna go take a peek.

01:12:06.207 --> 01:12:08.266
All right.

01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:10.840
Okay.

01:12:11.778 --> 01:12:14.008
Be careful.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.140
I don't see anything.

01:12:43.578 --> 01:12:45.239
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:12:45.413 --> 01:12:47.904
Okay. Okay.

01:12:48.015 --> 01:12:50.678
Grab anything with rust on it.

01:12:57.894 --> 01:13:00.624
Ah, this ought to do it.

01:13:01.931 --> 01:13:03.864
Let's hurry up.

01:13:18.113 --> 01:13:19.774
I think we're okay.

01:13:19.881 --> 01:13:21.041
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:23.117
What about the gate?
You think we can get out?

01:13:23.218 --> 01:13:24.776
No, it's probably open.

01:13:24.886 --> 01:13:28.322
I mean, the demons were the ones
that locked us in.

01:13:28.423 --> 01:13:31.222
We'll be okay.

01:13:32.161 --> 01:13:33.287
Oh! I'm okay.

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:47.076
Ow, fuck.

01:13:55.085 --> 01:13:56.712
Something's not right.

01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:01.520
Hold on.

01:14:07.363 --> 01:14:08.557

01:14:10.366 --> 01:14:11.924
What's going on?

01:14:12.101 --> 01:14:14.536
What's happening?

01:14:14.705 --> 01:14:16.764
It's -- it's a trick!

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:18.567
You guys, it's still fucking night.

01:15:43.162 --> 01:15:47.360
So screwed.
I am totally fucking screwed!

01:15:48.199 --> 01:15:50.463
If I don't get killed
by frickin' demons,

01:15:50.568 --> 01:15:53.196
Nigel's gonna blow

01:15:58.944 --> 01:15:59.706

talking about all night

is, like, "me, me, me"!

01:16:08.221 --> 01:16:11.679
You're right. You're right.

01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:20.762
No, I'm sorry.

01:16:21.802 --> 01:16:24.202
I know.

01:17:09.784 --> 01:17:11.514
Careful!

01:17:30.607 --> 01:17:33.201
There's nothing in there.
I didn't -- I didn't feel --

01:17:41.783 --> 01:17:42.647
Oh, God!

01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:01.831
It wasn't protected in there.
There's no spells on the walls.

01:18:02.004 --> 01:18:03.232
Did it bite you?

01:18:03.338 --> 01:18:05.602
You know what?

01:18:05.707 --> 01:18:07.766
I think that thing wanted to fuck me.

01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:10.039
Yeah, well, uh...

01:18:10.145 --> 01:18:12.978

one of the ways that they --

01:18:21.691 --> 01:18:24.922

No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:18:37.105 --> 01:18:39.505
Don't! Please!

01:18:39.608 --> 01:18:42.042

01:19:45.378 --> 01:19:48.677
Aah! Oh, my God!
What the fuck does it look like?

01:19:48.848 --> 01:19:50.179
Shh! You're gonna be okay.

01:19:50.883 --> 01:19:53.750
I'm gonna find something
to splint it with, all right?

01:19:53.919 --> 01:19:56.353
- No!
- Shh! It's okay.

01:19:56.455 --> 01:19:58.184
Oh, my God, it hurts.

01:19:59.325 --> 01:20:00.815
Oh, God.

01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:03.053
Oh, my God. I'm gonna die.

01:20:03.162 --> 01:20:04.925

- Oh, my God!

01:20:25.482 --> 01:20:26.311
It's okay.

01:20:26.484 --> 01:20:27.883
It's okay.

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.978
- Okay.

We're gonna do this
on three, okay?

01:20:31.823 --> 01:20:34.121
- No. No, no.
- Yeah, you'll be okay.
