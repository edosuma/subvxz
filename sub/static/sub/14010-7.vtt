00:02.733 --> 00:04.466
Previously on <i>Damages...</i>

00:04.468 --> 00:05.501
<i>I started seeing someone.</i>

00:06.170 --> 00:07.871
<i>Not being alone at night helps.</i>

00:07.873 --> 00:08.843
<i>I ran into your mom.</i>

00:08.845 --> 00:11.065
<i>What's wrong?
What do you need?</i>

00:11.067 --> 00:12.060
<i>Can I stay with you?</i>

00:12.062 --> 00:13.523
<i>Of course. Of course.</i>

00:13.525 --> 00:15.347
<i>Channing McClaren got
ahold of all of our records.</i>

00:15.349 --> 00:18.921
<i>I don't know what you fucking did,
Naomi, but we're all dead.</i>

00:18.923 --> 00:20.255
<i>Suppose Naomi Walling</i>

00:20.257 --> 00:22.185
<i>refused to leak what she knew.</i>

00:22.187 --> 00:25.586
<i>The easiest way would be to
steal it from the Princefield system.</i>

00:25.588 --> 00:27.782
<i>A guy like McClaren would
have no problem hacking in.</i>

00:27.784 --> 00:29.981
<i>You want access
to the Princefield servers?</i>

00:29.983 --> 00:31.777
<i>They could be
crucial to my lawsuit.</i>

00:31.779 --> 00:34.377
<i>The servers have already
been impounded for our investigation.</i>

00:34.379 --> 00:36.076
<i>Her leak-- you don't
know the whole story.</i>

00:36.078 --> 00:36.977
<i>Someone's approached</i>

00:36.979 --> 00:38.710
<i>Channing, offering to sell
new information regarding</i>

00:38.712 --> 00:39.910
<i>Princefield and Naomi Walling.</i>

00:39.912 --> 00:40.910
<i>So buy it.</i>

00:40.912 --> 00:42.577
<i>Channing won't
pay for information.</i>

00:42.579 --> 00:43.610
<i>Don't tell Channing.</i>

00:43.612 --> 00:47.311
<i>- This thing you're doing...
- I'll be fine.</i>

00:50.548 --> 00:52.614
<i>For once, we happen
to want the same thing.</i>

00:52.616 --> 00:55.051
<i>To try this case in court.</i>

00:55.053 --> 00:56.086
<i>I got to go.</i>

00:56.088 --> 00:59.020
<i>You're not afraid
of me, are you, Ellen?</i>

02:59.643 --> 03:00.809

03:00.811 --> 03:02.210
<i>Well, you should.</i>

03:02.212 --> 03:04.379
<i>It's a good time to
let PBS air it.</i>

03:04.381 --> 03:07.382
<i>We could use some
positive press.</i>

03:10.818 --> 03:12.485
<i>Channing.</i>

03:12.487 --> 03:14.487
<i>Look, I know I'm young, and if</i>

03:14.489 --> 03:15.622
<i>you weren't sleeping with me</i>

03:15.624 --> 03:17.657
<i>you probably wouldn't have
kept me around this long...</i>

03:17.659 --> 03:20.960
<i>- That's not true..
- but I'm smarter than you on some things.</i>

03:20.962 --> 03:22.462
<i>And you need good press.</i>

03:22.464 --> 03:25.999
<i>So watch the fucking
documentary.</i>

03:32.005 --> 03:34.039
<i>Mm, mm-mm-mm-mm.</i>

03:36.142 --> 03:38.143
<i>Watch it.</i>

03:44.717 --> 03:48.320
<i>The American State
Department said your Web</i>

03:49.823 --> 03:52.257
<i>the deaths of three
diplomats in Iraq.</i>

03:52.259 --> 03:53.658
<i>Untrue.</i>

03:53.660 --> 03:56.193
<i>Still, if you're leaking
stolen information...</i>

03:56.195 --> 03:58.128
<i>I don't leak anything.</i>

03:58.130 --> 03:59.729
<i>I provide a safe haven for</i>

03:59.731 --> 04:01.031
<i>whistle-blowers who want to get</i>

04:01.033 --> 04:02.031
<i>information to the public.</i>

04:02.033 --> 04:04.767
<i>What about your personal life?</i>

04:04.769 --> 04:08.437
<i>It's difficult to have
one when you live in shadow.</i>

04:08.439 --> 04:10.238
<i>I receive a lot of threats.</i>

04:10.240 --> 04:14.009
<i>Governments and CEOs
throughout the world have...</i>

04:17.147 --> 04:18.512
<i>Would it be safe to say you</i>

04:18.515 --> 04:21.516
<i>don't hold Channing
McClaren in high regard?</i>

04:22.319 --> 04:24.885
<i>Personally?</i>

04:24.887 --> 04:27.054
<i>I have nothing against him.</i>

04:27.056 --> 04:31.526
<i>It's his persona, his public
pile of publicity whoring</i>

04:31.528 --> 04:33.495
<i>that's where I draw the line.</i>

04:33.497 --> 04:35.931
<i>Your face has never
been seen in public.</i>

04:35.933 --> 04:38.400
<i>You go by the moniker
of Samurai Seven.</i>

04:38.402 --> 04:40.268
<i>Channing McClaren uses no</i>

04:40.270 --> 04:41.937
<i>moniker, he's not afraid
to show his face.</i>

04:41.939 --> 04:43.572
<i>That's my point, man.</i>

04:43.574 --> 04:44.707
<i>Hacking is about
wreaking havoc,</i>

04:44.709 --> 04:48.510
<i>cutting the balls off
the fucking Man.</i>

04:48.512 --> 04:51.313
<i>You see no distinction
between the havoc you seem</i>

04:51.315 --> 04:52.848
<i>happy, even proud, to wreak,</i>

04:52.850 --> 04:54.116
<i>and Mr. McClaren's stated aim</i>

04:54.118 --> 04:55.884
<i>of truth and transparency?</i>

04:55.886 --> 05:01.256
<i>Only one of
us flies in a private jet.</i>

05:01.258 --> 05:02.557
<i>There is a disturbing coda to</i>

05:02.559 --> 05:04.493
<i>Samurai Seven's
interview with us.</i>

05:04.495 --> 05:05.660
<i>Not long after we
talked to him,</i>

05:05.662 --> 05:07.696
<i>he was found dead in
a burned-out car.</i>

05:07.698 --> 05:08.697
<i>What the fuck?</i>

05:08.699 --> 05:11.232
<i>His remains only identifiable
by dental records.</i>

05:11.234 --> 05:13.335
<i>The police have no leads on the</i>

05:13.337 --> 05:15.970
<i>incident, and so, for now, his
death remains a mystery.</i>

05:15.972 --> 05:17.839
<i>Perhaps wreaking havoc wasn't</i>

05:17.841 --> 05:21.742
<i>Samurai Seven's best course
of action after all.</i>

05:23.746 --> 05:25.979
<i>His name
is Dr. Lee Collins.</i>

05:25.981 --> 05:28.748
<i>He's a computer science
professor who's been hired by</i>

05:28.750 --> 05:30.216
<i>the SEC to conduct the forensic</i>

05:30.218 --> 05:32.918
<i>examination of the
Princefield servers.</i>

05:32.920 --> 05:33.986
<i>Your Honor, it was my</i>

05:33.988 --> 05:36.488
<i>understanding that the SEC
wasn't willing to allow us</i>

05:36.490 --> 05:37.456
<i>access to the servers.</i>

05:37.458 --> 05:39.725
<i>They had their
arm twisted by me.</i>

05:39.727 --> 05:41.026
<i>So, Dr. Collins has now been</i>

05:41.028 --> 05:42.528
<i>made available for an interview.</i>

05:42.530 --> 05:44.596
<i>Well, that's
great news, Your Honor.</i>

05:44.598 --> 05:46.632
<i>An</i> interview.
As in one.

05:46.634 --> 05:50.135
Both of you, same time.

05:50.137 --> 05:53.071
Your Honor, that
could affect strategy.

05:53.073 --> 05:55.072
Patty, this is a gift.

05:55.074 --> 05:56.574
I don't expect a
thank you note.

05:56.576 --> 05:59.677
But I do expect you both to
handle yourselves accordingly.

05:59.679 --> 06:02.113
You will not have access to the
hardware, so don't ask him, but

06:02.115 --> 06:03.347
you will hear Dr. Collins'

06:03.349 --> 06:05.282
analysis of the server logs.

06:05.284 --> 06:08.853
Pick a time that's
good for both of you.

06:08.855 --> 06:11.622
- Who will coordinate?
- I will.

06:11.624 --> 06:13.591
Get it done this week.

06:13.593 --> 06:17.461
I want to wrap up discovery and hear
opening arguments within the month.

06:17.463 --> 06:18.596
Understood.

06:18.598 --> 06:21.132
I haven't taken
a vacation in five years.

06:21.134 --> 06:22.734
Five.

06:22.736 --> 06:25.770
At the end of next month,
I am going to Mustique.

06:25.772 --> 06:28.906
And trust me, neither of you wants
to be the lawyer that puts

06:28.908 --> 06:30.908
a crimp in that plan.

06:36.282 --> 06:39.450
All right, all right,
we have time for one more.

06:39.452 --> 06:40.818
Anyone?

06:40.820 --> 06:41.920
C-Money.

06:41.922 --> 06:45.824
Yeah, uh, Chris, first
I'd like to say thank you

06:45.826 --> 06:48.560
for being here and, uh, you
know, helping us out and all.

06:48.562 --> 06:49.294
Right?

06:49.963 --> 06:51.129
That's right.

06:51.131 --> 06:55.000
I wanted to ask something
of an etiquette question, like...

06:56.003 --> 06:58.503
Come on, et-i-quette, all
right, look it up, homies.

06:58.505 --> 06:59.504
All right, go on.

06:59.506 --> 07:02.006
Go on, man.

07:02.008 --> 07:05.443
I'm headed to a job
interview and... what's your

07:05.445 --> 07:07.979
take, arm or no arm?

07:07.981 --> 07:09.214
What do you mean?

07:09.216 --> 07:13.185
I mean, you know, I'm
dressed in a suit and sharp

07:13.187 --> 07:14.519
and all, wearing my arm.

07:14.521 --> 07:19.557
Or do I lose the arm, and, uh,
tuck the sleeve back, you

07:19.559 --> 07:20.992
know, neat and all?

07:20.994 --> 07:24.094
Well, that's a tough
question, for sure. I mean...

07:24.096 --> 07:27.297
I'm saying, I mean, do
I go for the sympathy vote,

07:27.299 --> 07:30.900
you know, "Shit, dude lost his
arm, got to hire him," or

07:30.902 --> 07:34.103
the less-likely
to-freak-the-man-out-'cause-I-

07:34.105 --> 07:35.070
got-no-fucking-arm vote?

07:35.072 --> 07:38.507
I just say, you
keep it simple, you know?

07:38.509 --> 07:41.310
You got to do what makes
you feel comfortable.

07:41.312 --> 07:43.878
And if that means wearing
the arm, then wear the arm.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.180
Just be true to you.

07:46.182 --> 07:48.449
All right, look, we
got to wrap it up.

07:48.451 --> 07:51.018
You find yourselves sinking into
a rut you can't get out of,

07:51.020 --> 07:52.319
write it down.

07:52.321 --> 07:53.721
Call me, okay?

07:53.723 --> 07:55.757
It's good stuff today,
all of you guys.

07:55.759 --> 07:57.058
I'll see you soon, all right?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.593
Thanks a lot, man.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.797
Hey.

08:05.802 --> 08:07.469
Chris? Chris?

08:07.471 --> 08:09.972
You all right, man?

08:09.974 --> 08:12.208
Yeah, yeah, solid.

08:12.210 --> 08:14.343
About that other thing?

08:14.345 --> 08:17.813
Anyone get back to you?

08:17.815 --> 08:19.882
Yeah, my bud from the 7th.

08:19.884 --> 08:23.887
He got real tight with this dude
from Atlanta on that last tour.

08:23.889 --> 08:27.991
Their patrol got hit,
IEDs, usual mayhem.

08:27.993 --> 08:32.496
But, this dude from Atlanta
just loses his shit, I mean,

08:32.498 --> 08:36.299
full fucking monty, so they
fly him up to Ramstein.

08:36.302 --> 08:37.568
The psych ward?

08:37.570 --> 08:38.534
Yeah.

08:38.537 --> 08:41.304
Enters as your standard nut job
and asscake lockup, exits 14

08:41.307 --> 08:43.506
days later good to go.

08:43.509 --> 08:45.609
And now they're
sending him back?

08:45.611 --> 08:48.645
Just like they did with all
the other dudes you told me about.

08:48.647 --> 08:51.949
I mean, they pumped him full of
mommy's little helpers first.

08:51.951 --> 08:53.217
He's happier than prom night.

08:53.219 --> 08:54.351
Right as rain.

08:54.353 --> 08:55.419
You got a name?

08:55.421 --> 08:56.487
Better.

08:56.489 --> 08:59.023
I got his video chat handle.

08:59.025 --> 09:00.758
He's expecting you.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.561
Hopes you can help 'cause he
doesn't want to go back to duty.

09:03.563 --> 09:05.830
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

09:05.832 --> 09:06.830
Thank you.

09:06.832 --> 09:08.866
All right.

09:15.540 --> 09:17.609
Hey.

09:20.680 --> 09:23.682
Thanks for coming.

09:23.684 --> 09:25.351
What the hell happened?

09:25.353 --> 09:26.886
I don't know.

09:26.888 --> 09:28.955
How did the Samurai die?

09:28.957 --> 09:30.957
I already tell the
police everything.

09:30.959 --> 09:32.025
They do nothing.

09:32.027 --> 09:33.026
They know nothing.

09:33.028 --> 09:35.295
Who else have you spoken to?

09:35.297 --> 09:38.298
Your people.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.700
My people?

09:39.702 --> 09:40.867
Yes.

09:40.869 --> 09:43.670
Who are you talking about?

09:43.672 --> 09:45.873
Gitta, your lady lawyer.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.708
Gitta and Ellen?

09:47.710 --> 09:49.143
You spoke to them?

09:49.145 --> 09:54.983
They tried to buy the
information Samurai was selling.

09:54.985 --> 09:57.252
They met with the Samurai?

09:57.254 --> 10:02.491
And Patty Hewes bought
this information also.

10:02.493 --> 10:06.128
What was the information?

10:06.130 --> 10:07.129
I don't know.

10:07.131 --> 10:08.997
All I know is now he's dead.

10:08.999 --> 10:12.802
So someone must not be
wanting him selling it.

10:16.641 --> 10:18.341
You got money?

10:18.343 --> 10:20.444
Yeah.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.115
I'm sorry about the Samurai.

10:28.287 --> 10:29.821
You be careful.

10:29.823 --> 10:32.390
<i>You</i> be careful.

10:37.864 --> 10:39.832
Good news, Your Honor.

10:39.834 --> 10:41.934
Dr. Collins has agreed to
make time for us this week.

10:41.936 --> 10:43.969
When will you see him?

10:43.971 --> 10:45.103
Thursday afternoon.

10:45.105 --> 10:46.204
Patty?

10:46.206 --> 10:48.140
Thursday would be fine.

10:48.142 --> 10:50.476
There's one hiccup, though.

10:50.478 --> 10:53.311
He can't travel, so we have to
meet him at the university.

10:53.313 --> 10:54.346
In Maine.

10:54.348 --> 10:57.282
I've booked us both
seats on the 8:00 a.m. flight.

10:57.284 --> 10:59.284
I'll e-mail you the
itinerary, Patty.

10:59.286 --> 11:00.986
That won't be necessary.

11:00.988 --> 11:01.754
I'll make my own arrangements.

11:01.756 --> 11:03.222
Whatever's your pleasure.

11:03.224 --> 11:04.289
Just get it done.

11:04.291 --> 11:08.093
And if you happen to reach a settlement
while you're up there, all the better.

11:08.095 --> 11:12.098
I think a trip to Maine in the
winter'll do you both a world of good.

11:12.100 --> 11:16.202
They don't call it
Vacationland for nothing.

11:19.774 --> 11:22.743
Okay, let me make sure
I got the timeline straight.

11:22.745 --> 11:25.413
- A couple weeks ago...
- Uh, two weeks, two days.

11:25.415 --> 11:26.781
Two weeks, two days.

11:26.783 --> 11:30.218
You arrive at Ramstein, they run
you through a psych eval, they

11:30.220 --> 11:32.754
start you on medication.

11:32.756 --> 11:35.791
You're under observation, more
tests, a bunch of doctors ask

11:35.793 --> 11:38.027
- you more questions...
- Yes, sir.

11:38.029 --> 11:39.428
That's correct.

11:39.430 --> 11:40.929
Okay, got it.

11:40.931 --> 11:43.499
And now they're shipping you out
in a couple of days, heading

11:43.501 --> 11:44.434
back to active duty.

11:44.436 --> 11:46.569
That's the long and
short of it, sir.

11:46.571 --> 11:49.472
Do you have any idea what
kind of meds they have you on?

11:49.474 --> 11:50.340
No, sir.

11:50.342 --> 11:51.341
They don't tell us a thing.

11:51.343 --> 11:53.343
Little white pills,
take this, take that.

11:53.345 --> 11:56.045
Lay off the booze and don't
drink any grapefruit juice.

11:56.047 --> 11:58.047
And you're okay with that?

11:58.049 --> 12:00.249
You feeling okay now?

12:01.486 --> 12:02.485
Feeling okay?

12:02.487 --> 12:04.954
Shit, I don't know.

12:04.956 --> 12:06.755
Look, on the pills, I'm fine.

12:06.757 --> 12:08.591
A regular G.I. Joe.

12:08.593 --> 12:09.792
But?

12:09.794 --> 12:11.894
But that's not how it's been going
once guys like me are back

12:11.896 --> 12:14.763
in-country and the docs
stop dispensing meds.

12:14.765 --> 12:18.867
Some guys shoot anything that moves,
other dudes are committing suicide.

12:18.869 --> 12:20.869
And the doctors
know about this?

12:20.871 --> 12:21.870
Shit, yeah.

12:21.872 --> 12:23.305
I-I told them in
the interviews.

12:23.307 --> 12:24.540
What interviews?

12:24.542 --> 12:26.709
It's... a lot of times
it's just like this.

12:26.711 --> 12:27.877
What do you mean?

12:27.879 --> 12:29.545
Like, on video chat.

12:29.547 --> 12:31.781
The doctors were
stateside, at the VA.

12:31.783 --> 12:34.250
It's all standard
military procedure.

12:34.252 --> 12:36.252
Wait, the doctors
don't see you in person?

12:36.254 --> 12:37.253
No.

12:37.255 --> 12:39.488
All on video chat.

12:39.490 --> 12:43.192
That's why I'm scared, of
what's going to happen to me.

12:44.529 --> 12:48.531
Look, I haven't even
told you half the story.

12:48.533 --> 12:49.699
There's more?

12:49.701 --> 12:51.768
Fuck yeah, there's more.

12:57.709 --> 13:04.915
- So... - Ellen Parsons remains
convinced that Patty Hewes has no case.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.017
Patty Hewes is a bull running
loose in the market.

13:07.019 --> 13:09.319
Every day we risk more damage.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.957
Do you remember that
Princefield information we were

13:13.959 --> 13:16.894
trying to buy?

13:16.896 --> 13:17.895
Well, I was right.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.330
Patty Hewes bought it.

13:19.332 --> 13:23.601
But Ellen forced her to
hand it over in discovery.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.537
What did it say?

13:26.539 --> 13:29.807
Princefield was
investigating Naomi Walling long

13:29.809 --> 13:31.275
before we posted the leak.

13:31.277 --> 13:34.545
Is that so?

13:34.547 --> 13:36.947
You never told me
Bennett Herreshoff handed the

13:36.949 --> 13:40.284
investigation over to
the SEC a year ago.

13:40.286 --> 13:43.654
So?

13:43.656 --> 13:49.192
So... It's just...
There's something at play here,

13:49.194 --> 13:52.128
and I'm fucked if I can
see where it's headed.

13:52.130 --> 13:56.399
Just continue to
manage the situation.

14:16.319 --> 14:18.754
You okay?

14:21.826 --> 14:26.061
Yeah, I just...
I just couldn't sleep.

14:28.898 --> 14:30.599
You have bad dreams?

14:30.601 --> 14:32.134
Nah, no, no.

14:33.137 --> 14:34.436
No, it's nothing like that.

14:34.438 --> 14:38.040
- I'm, um...
- Oh, goodness, I'm sorry.

14:38.042 --> 14:40.776
Geez, Mom...
There's another bathroom.

14:40.778 --> 14:41.810
I know.

14:41.812 --> 14:45.047
- I just... need some, um...
- It's okay, Mom.

14:45.049 --> 14:47.716
I got it.

14:47.718 --> 14:50.586
Toilet paper.

14:50.588 --> 14:51.620
I'm so sorry.

14:51.622 --> 14:52.788
I'll leave you two alone.

14:52.790 --> 14:53.789
Good night.

14:53.791 --> 14:54.790
Good night.

14:54.792 --> 14:57.859
Good night.

15:00.430 --> 15:01.395
I'm sorry.

15:01.397 --> 15:03.431
How long is
your mom staying here?

15:03.433 --> 15:05.432
I got her an apartment.

15:05.434 --> 15:12.238
Kate's helping her
move out tomorrow.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.908
What's going on?

15:15.910 --> 15:24.283
I'm... I've been just
working through some ideas.

15:24.285 --> 15:29.221
About what?

15:29.223 --> 15:34.560
Any chance you could
introduce me to McClaren?

15:34.562 --> 15:39.432
Why?

15:39.434 --> 15:42.068
I think I got
something for him.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.069
What are you talking about?

15:44.071 --> 15:47.306
A leak he could post.

15:47.308 --> 15:53.346
I got some stuff about how the
military's handling soldiers with PTSD.

15:53.348 --> 15:55.782
Okay.

15:55.784 --> 15:57.785
Uh... Tell me.

15:57.787 --> 16:00.688
They're running some
kind of fucked-up program using

16:00.690 --> 16:06.260
SSRIs to... to glue grunts with
post-traumatic stress back together.

16:06.262 --> 16:08.897
So they could send
them back into combat.

16:08.899 --> 16:10.165
SSRIs?

16:10.167 --> 16:11.132
Drugs.

16:11.134 --> 16:12.467
Antidepressants.

16:12.469 --> 16:14.202
Are they legal or experimental?

16:14.204 --> 16:15.803
They're legal,
but that's not the point.

16:15.805 --> 16:18.606
These guys should not be
sent back into combat.

16:18.608 --> 16:19.974
They're sick.

16:19.976 --> 16:21.942
The drugs are just
covering it up.

16:21.944 --> 16:23.910
And how do you know this?

16:23.912 --> 16:25.678
I talked to some of them.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.381
I heard stories about
a bunch of others.

16:28.383 --> 16:32.951
Some of these soldiers, they go
back into combat and... and they

16:32.953 --> 16:35.120
just go off.

16:35.122 --> 16:36.955
They just... they snap.

16:36.957 --> 16:39.124
Do you have any proof?

16:39.126 --> 16:40.858
That it's going down?

16:40.860 --> 16:43.394
You mean, like...
like files and shit?

16:43.396 --> 16:44.562
Yeah.

16:44.564 --> 16:45.663
Other than the stories.

16:45.665 --> 16:47.665
Can't McClaren get that?

16:47.667 --> 16:49.033
I mean, he-he's
a hacker, right?

16:49.035 --> 16:52.136
That's how he started, but...
it's illegal to

16:52.138 --> 16:54.105
steal information
and put it online.

16:54.107 --> 16:56.307
So how does it work?

16:58.378 --> 17:01.846
They're a site
for whistle-blowers.

17:01.848 --> 17:06.218
So they post leaks that
other people send to them.

17:06.220 --> 17:12.357
McClaren keeps everything at arm's
length so he's never exposed legally.

17:12.358 --> 17:19.164
So I've got to break the law
if I want this information out there?

17:19.165 --> 17:25.670
Without any proof, there's
nothing for McClaren to do.

17:25.672 --> 17:30.142
We can talk more when I
get back from Maine.

17:34.514 --> 17:36.647
The goal of any
attack on a firewalled system

17:36.649 --> 17:41.185
like Princefield's is simple,
to get superuser access.

17:41.187 --> 17:46.057
Once privileged, you can go
anywhere and do anything.

17:46.059 --> 17:50.061
Have you been able to establish
that the server was actually attacked?

17:50.063 --> 17:52.263
Yeah, I-I-I'm
getting to that.

17:52.265 --> 17:58.670
Uh, the attacker typically uses a
well-documented Apache exploit

17:58.672 --> 18:04.610
allowing access typically to stealthy
ports in the 400 to 500 range.

18:04.612 --> 18:06.879
In the case of the
Princefield systems, you

18:06.881 --> 18:09.515
mentioned the attacker would
have to have an additional

18:09.517 --> 18:10.749
authentication factor?

18:10.751 --> 18:12.518
Bingo.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.619
The easiest vector would
be a user password.

18:14.621 --> 18:17.955
You've explained
the Princefield server.

18:17.957 --> 18:21.892
But what about the security on
Naomi Walling's personal laptop?

18:21.894 --> 18:25.462
Okay, uh...
same, but different.

18:25.464 --> 18:26.797
Here we go.

18:26.799 --> 18:29.766
There is unassailable forensic
evidence of an intrusion

18:29.768 --> 18:33.402
vectored through the Princefield
server into Ms. Walling's

18:33.404 --> 18:34.737
personal device.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.839
Bottom
line, Dr. Collins.

18:36.841 --> 18:39.442
Bottom line?

18:39.444 --> 18:45.114
The McClaren leak was accessed
through Ms. Walling's laptop.

18:45.116 --> 18:47.350
Dr. Collins, I get that
the evidence of the hack is

18:47.352 --> 18:51.487
strong, and the data was stolen
from Naomi Walling's computer.

18:51.489 --> 18:53.656
In my
professional opinion, yes.

18:53.658 --> 18:55.625
And can you say
anything about who stole it?

18:55.627 --> 18:57.794
No, I can't say that,
but I trust you realize

18:57.796 --> 19:00.464
the level of expertise
required to pull that off.

19:00.466 --> 19:06.403
Could someone like Channing
McClaren have that level of expertise?

19:06.405 --> 19:07.504
Oh, yes.

19:07.506 --> 19:12.276
I would think so.

19:12.278 --> 19:14.612
Dr. Collins, have you
heard of a hacker by the

19:14.614 --> 19:18.115
name of Samurai Seven?

19:18.117 --> 19:20.217
I know <i>of</i> him, yes.

19:20.219 --> 19:23.353
Would he have the expertise?

19:23.355 --> 19:25.222
Absolutely.

19:25.224 --> 19:28.725
Thank you,
Dr. Collins, for your help.

19:28.727 --> 19:30.726
Ms. Hewes,
Ms. Parsons.

19:30.728 --> 19:32.728
Y'all better get your
horses saddled up.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.530
There's a nor'easter
on its way.

19:34.532 --> 19:37.066
The storm's gonna
get quite nasty.

19:37.068 --> 19:38.401
Thank you, Professor.

19:40.238 --> 19:43.505
Oh, shit.

19:43.507 --> 19:45.140
Everything okay?

19:45.142 --> 19:48.743
My flight's been cancelled.

19:48.745 --> 19:50.578
The storm.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.914
Well, you can
always come with me.

19:52.916 --> 19:53.915
No. Thanks.

19:53.917 --> 19:57.519
I'll go to the airport and
wait for the next flight.

19:57.521 --> 20:00.689
It's really no trouble, Ellen.

20:00.691 --> 20:02.157
I'll manage.

20:02.159 --> 20:05.260
Well, I'll send you the
FBO and the plane's tail

20:05.262 --> 20:09.698
number, in case you
change your mind.

20:13.804 --> 20:16.406
Uh...
You need to know languages if

20:16.408 --> 20:19.976
you're gonna hack, so Python's
a good place to start.

20:19.978 --> 20:21.344
So not C, not Java?

20:21.346 --> 20:24.348
Well, Channing hasn't taught me
those yet, so I'd be no use to you there.

20:25.351 --> 20:26.383
Hey, just in time.

20:26.385 --> 20:27.718
You want to take
over the lesson?

20:27.720 --> 20:31.222
I spoke to Beth Kim.

20:31.224 --> 20:33.892
You went behind my back and paid
Samurai Seven for information.

20:33.894 --> 20:34.893
Oh, shit.

20:34.895 --> 20:37.862
- Channing, we were just...
- Shut up!

20:37.864 --> 20:39.864
Don't...
don't take this out on her.

20:39.866 --> 20:40.865
It was my idea.

20:40.867 --> 20:42.366
Oh, so Ellen
didn't put you up to it?

20:42.368 --> 20:43.000
No.

20:43.002 --> 20:43.701
I brought her in.

20:43.703 --> 20:47.071
- I couldn't release the funds, so...
- So you disobeyed my direct order!

20:47.073 --> 20:47.872
Order?

20:47.874 --> 20:49.975
What is this, the
fucking military now?

20:49.977 --> 20:52.277
Look, you disobeyed my advice.

20:52.279 --> 20:55.246
We had to find out what
information Samurai had.

20:55.248 --> 20:57.648
Not by paying for it!

20:57.650 --> 21:01.551
I am responsible for the
running of this organization.

21:01.553 --> 21:03.987
That means that sometimes I have
to make decisions that it's

21:03.989 --> 21:05.955
better you don't
know anything about.

21:05.957 --> 21:10.326
What you did
got the Samurai killed.

21:10.328 --> 21:13.695
You don't know that.

21:13.697 --> 21:16.097
The man had enemies everywhere.

21:16.099 --> 21:20.702
Maybe his death had
nothing to do with this.

21:25.475 --> 21:27.443
So what information
did we get from him?

21:27.445 --> 21:29.411
Princefield was
investigating Naomi.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.813
They handed it over to the SEC.

21:30.815 --> 21:31.848
It's all a dead end anyway.

21:31.850 --> 21:35.652
Give me what you found.

21:40.391 --> 21:42.759
Channing, baby,
we didn't mean to...

21:42.761 --> 21:45.362
Stay the fuck away from me.

21:45.364 --> 21:48.699
From now on, you do what
I say or you're gone.

21:48.701 --> 21:52.970
Both of you.

22:00.713 --> 22:04.483
We still have the threat for
several inches of additional snow.

22:04.485 --> 22:06.251
That was impressive,
looking at those numbers.

22:06.253 --> 22:09.054
This is where we still
have that threat tonight.

22:09.056 --> 22:12.491
This whole area, the Northeast, here in
New England, we're seeing snow. Kelly.

22:12.493 --> 22:15.027
This is where we still
have that threat tonight.

22:15.029 --> 22:17.397
The white here, winter
storm warnings.

22:17.399 --> 22:20.700
All of this, from Maine,
down to Pennsylvania and...

22:20.702 --> 22:21.668
Changed your mind?

22:21.670 --> 22:25.472
All the commercial flights
are cancelled in and out of Bangor.

22:27.676 --> 22:30.744
Is your plane still going?

22:30.746 --> 22:32.880
My pilot
just e-mailed me.

22:32.882 --> 22:33.981
We leave in about 35 minutes.

22:33.983 --> 22:36.017
What about the storm?

22:36.019 --> 22:39.319
That's one of the
perks of flying private.

22:39.321 --> 22:43.624
The airports don't get
jammed up in bad weather.

22:43.626 --> 22:45.759
Do you still have room?

22:45.761 --> 22:52.900
It's a G5 with 15
empty seats and a full bar.

22:52.902 --> 22:56.737
Welcome aboard.

22:56.739 --> 22:59.272
Thank you for
letting me come along.

22:59.274 --> 23:02.109
No need to thank me.

23:02.111 --> 23:03.811
I'm happy for the company.

23:07.449 --> 23:08.415
Excuse me.

23:08.417 --> 23:09.583
Of course.

23:12.421 --> 23:13.987
Hello?

23:13.989 --> 23:15.722
He found out.

23:15.724 --> 23:18.825
Wait.
Who-who found out about what?

23:18.827 --> 23:19.826
Channing.

23:19.828 --> 23:22.296
He found out about Samurai Seven,
that we went behind his

23:22.298 --> 23:24.732
his back, tried to buy
the data, everything.

23:24.734 --> 23:25.733
How?

23:25.735 --> 23:26.968
He spoke to Beth Kim.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.003
Fuck!

23:28.005 --> 23:30.439
Okay, Gitta,
just calm down, okay?

23:30.441 --> 23:31.840
He was fucking pissed.

23:31.842 --> 23:32.941
I mean... shit.

23:32.943 --> 23:34.209
I've never seen him like that.

23:34.211 --> 23:35.343
I will handle this.

23:35.345 --> 23:38.613
You know, he's blaming us for...
for getting Samurai Seven killed.

23:38.615 --> 23:39.914
Let me talk to him.

23:39.916 --> 23:41.950
He's gone AWOL again.

23:41.952 --> 23:44.185
- He stormed out of the house...
- Okay, okay.

23:44.187 --> 23:46.321
Well, I...
I'm heading back soon.

23:46.323 --> 23:47.455
I'll try calling him from here.

23:47.457 --> 23:49.157
You let me know if he shows up.

23:49.159 --> 23:50.158
Okay.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.460
And if he calls
me, I'll let you know.

23:52.462 --> 23:53.494
Yeah, please do.

23:53.496 --> 23:56.730
Thanks.

23:59.936 --> 24:00.935
It's Channing.

24:00.937 --> 24:01.969
Leave a message.

24:02.939 --> 24:03.938
It's Ellen Parsons.

24:03.940 --> 24:05.406
I just heard from Gitta.

24:05.408 --> 24:08.442
Please call me back as
soon as you get this.

24:08.444 --> 24:11.479
I will explain everything.

24:22.124 --> 24:24.292
Everything okay?

24:24.294 --> 24:26.661
Just fine.

24:26.663 --> 24:29.331
As you can see, the winds
have really picked up.

24:29.333 --> 24:33.535
Looks like we got winds at about
25, 30 miles an hour right now.

24:33.537 --> 24:36.037
Obviously the snow
is coming down.

24:36.039 --> 24:38.440
We're at about five to
six inches right now.

24:38.442 --> 24:41.109
We could get up to
two feet of snow.

24:42.245 --> 24:45.514
So a lot of pressure, a lot of
cold weather, a lot of moisture,

24:45.516 --> 24:52.755
a lot of snow, and it's going to
continue this way all night long, so...

24:55.525 --> 24:56.959
Hey, there he is!

24:56.961 --> 24:57.960
Mr. Davies.

24:57.962 --> 24:59.962
Can't believe you showed up.

24:59.964 --> 25:02.398
Sorry we have to meet
in this shit hole.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.502
This is my new office, since you
fucked me out of my old one.

25:05.504 --> 25:09.006
You got quite a sack
on you, pretty boy.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.107
Got to give you that.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.142
Have a seat.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.144
Thanks for meeting me.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.946
Oh, it's my pleasure.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.815
We're just two sides of the
same shekel, you and me.

25:18.817 --> 25:19.816
How's that?

25:19.818 --> 25:20.850
I don't know.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.085
I move money around,
you move information.

25:23.087 --> 25:25.520
It's just a big power
game, and you won.

25:25.522 --> 25:28.056
Just 'cause I had a
lapse in judgment.

25:28.058 --> 25:30.625
I put my faith in a fucking
Judas with high heels.

25:30.627 --> 25:31.592
Naomi Walling.

25:31.594 --> 25:36.931
Naomi Fucking Walling.

25:38.900 --> 25:42.436
This world is just a shit
pile of me-first vultures.

25:42.438 --> 25:46.540
You can't trust a fucking soul.

25:48.743 --> 25:53.714
So... how can I help
you, Mr. McClaren?

25:53.716 --> 25:57.050
An acquaintance of
mine was killed recently.

25:57.052 --> 25:58.218
He was a hacker.

25:58.220 --> 26:00.720
And he got his hands on
some Princefield documents.

26:00.722 --> 26:02.822
What does that
have to do with me?

26:02.824 --> 26:05.090
Well, this hacker
sold some of his information.

26:05.092 --> 26:06.058
Anything interesting?

26:06.060 --> 26:09.861
I think so.

26:09.863 --> 26:12.764
Did you know Bennett Herreshoff
was having you investigated by

26:12.766 --> 26:14.465
the SEC for insider trading?

26:14.467 --> 26:16.835
What the fuck
you talking about?

26:16.837 --> 26:20.639
Herreshoff had the commission
open a file on Fund 23 about a year ago.

26:20.641 --> 26:22.941
Both you and Naomi
were targets.

26:22.943 --> 26:23.942
That cocksucker.

26:23.944 --> 26:27.079
How would Herreshoff
know what you were up to?

26:27.081 --> 26:29.448
How would he
know what we were up to?

26:29.450 --> 26:32.985
He created Fund 23 so that we would
do the type of trading that we did.

26:32.987 --> 26:34.987
Can you prove that?

26:34.989 --> 26:35.988
Of course not.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.957
Herreshoff's the
head of the bank.

26:37.959 --> 26:40.226
Put a firewall so he
could deny everything.

26:40.228 --> 26:43.262
Herreshoff didn't kill your friend,
if that's what you're thinking.

26:43.264 --> 26:45.298
What makes you say that?

26:45.300 --> 26:47.333
Number one, he's a pussy.

26:47.335 --> 26:49.803
Number two, he's the
head of the bank.

26:49.805 --> 26:50.803
He's protected.

26:50.805 --> 26:51.804
He wouldn't need to.

26:51.806 --> 26:53.807
He wouldn't be
afraid of a hacker.

26:53.809 --> 26:55.809
Well, who would then?

26:55.811 --> 26:57.944
Well, you
think I'm gonna tell you that?

26:57.946 --> 27:01.214
You're out on bail, but
you're headed back to prison.

27:01.216 --> 27:03.416
You're the scapegoat
in all of this.

27:03.418 --> 27:04.450
No shit.

27:04.452 --> 27:06.419
Then why protect anyone?

27:06.421 --> 27:07.421
Loyalty?

27:07.423 --> 27:08.422
To who?

27:08.424 --> 27:11.492
Anyone ever show
loyalty to you?

27:14.963 --> 27:19.968
I can get the truth out there, and no
one will ever know it came from you.

27:23.073 --> 27:27.375
Yeah.

27:27.377 --> 27:31.445
Fuck it, huh?

27:45.461 --> 27:47.062
Who's that?

27:47.064 --> 27:50.999
That's the name of the
guy who gave me the stock tips.

27:51.001 --> 27:54.937
Without him, there wouldn't
have been any insider trading.

27:54.939 --> 27:59.242
Next round's on you.

28:08.152 --> 28:11.654
All of this from Maine-- this is
where we have winter storm warnings.

28:11.656 --> 28:13.990
Also, we have the advisories
and the watches right now.

28:13.992 --> 28:16.992
This whole area-- the Northeast,
here in New England-- and this

28:16.994 --> 28:18.260
is the reason why.

28:18.262 --> 28:21.329
This area of low pressure, and
all of the snow that's flying.

28:21.331 --> 28:23.698
So what we're looking at
here-- this is the radar.

28:23.700 --> 28:27.234
This is showing us where we're seeing
the snow, where we're seeing the rain.

28:27.236 --> 28:30.270
But this low is also going to
be generating a lot of wind.

28:30.272 --> 28:32.906
We could see wind gusts
upwards of 55 miles an hour.

28:32.908 --> 28:35.175
That can bring down
branches just by itself.

28:35.177 --> 28:39.012
- When you add this...
- Oh, how many refills

28:39.014 --> 28:46.286
do I have on, um-- let's see, it's
number G-five...

28:46.288 --> 28:49.088
Still have the threat for
several inches of additional snow.

28:49.090 --> 28:51.323
That was impressive,
looking at those numbers.

28:51.325 --> 28:54.660
This is where we still have that
threat tonight, the white here,

28:54.662 --> 28:55.894
winter storm warming.

28:55.896 --> 28:59.999
More than two million people,
customers without power at this time.

29:00.001 --> 29:03.669
This is one of the hardest hit
areas when it comes to the snow.

29:03.671 --> 29:06.806
We can see even more
than five inches.

29:06.808 --> 29:10.910
We still have the threat for
several inches of additional snow.

29:10.912 --> 29:11.711
Another delay.

29:11.713 --> 29:12.712
Oh. Why?

29:12.714 --> 29:15.816
Something about
frozen fuel lines.

29:15.818 --> 29:18.185
How long of a delay?

29:18.187 --> 29:20.354
Uh, several hours at least.

29:20.356 --> 29:24.058
Oh, shit!

29:24.060 --> 29:27.696
If you are out, you really
should go inside right now.

29:27.698 --> 29:31.400
There's nobody on the street...

29:31.402 --> 29:33.669
Parsons and Associates.

29:33.671 --> 29:34.770
Hey, it's me.

29:34.772 --> 29:36.004
Hey.

29:36.006 --> 29:37.038
How's Maine?

29:37.040 --> 29:38.173
Pick me up a lobster?

29:38.175 --> 29:40.408
Have you heard
from Channing McClaren?

29:40.410 --> 29:41.376
No.

29:41.378 --> 29:42.410
What's going on?

29:42.412 --> 29:44.546
I'll tell you
about it when I get back.

29:44.548 --> 29:46.014
Let me know if he calls.

29:46.016 --> 29:47.015
Of course.

29:47.017 --> 29:49.150
And what about my mom?

29:49.152 --> 29:51.152
Oh, she is a sweetheart.

29:51.154 --> 29:54.455
I got her into the apartment, and
when I left, she was just fine.

29:54.457 --> 29:55.456
Okay. Great.

29:55.458 --> 29:56.424
Thank you.

29:56.426 --> 30:00.429
I'm gonna be later than I thought,
so I'll touch base when I get in.

30:00.431 --> 30:01.463
Safe flight.

30:01.465 --> 30:03.599
Thanks.

30:03.601 --> 30:04.567
Thank you.

30:06.037 --> 30:08.137
May I take that for you, sir?

30:08.139 --> 30:11.207
Thank you.

30:14.112 --> 30:16.146
So, how is your mother?

30:16.148 --> 30:17.114
Really want to know?

30:17.116 --> 30:18.548
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

30:18.550 --> 30:22.986
Well, because every time we talk
about her, you end up in a rage.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.155
I'm just...
I'm just asking how she is.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.157
Yeah, she's well.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.325
She's <i>really</i> well, in fact.

30:28.327 --> 30:32.662
I, um, saw her in the holidays,
and we spent a week up north.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.632
She still with
that Danish prick?

30:35.634 --> 30:36.666
Here we go.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.634
Mm.

30:37.636 --> 30:38.668
Come on.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.704
All right, you don't
have to answer.

30:41.706 --> 30:45.541
Wow.

30:45.543 --> 30:47.143
She got you for a week.

30:47.145 --> 30:51.014
I've hardly seen you for more than
a few days last couple of years.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.148
You never come to London.

30:52.150 --> 30:54.817
Well, it's been a
little bit inhospitable to us.

30:54.819 --> 30:57.920
Seems like you and Channing
are trying your best to make

30:57.922 --> 30:59.122
that true worldwide.

30:59.124 --> 31:00.122
I never liked McClaren.

31:00.124 --> 31:01.090
Really?

31:01.092 --> 31:02.091
I didn't know that.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.627
Why are you still with him, Dad?

31:04.629 --> 31:05.628
You're wasting your talents.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.063
Can we just not
have this conversation?

31:08.065 --> 31:09.665
I only see you for one day.

31:09.667 --> 31:10.966
Can we not go there again?

31:10.968 --> 31:13.001
You're a brilliant journalist.

31:13.003 --> 31:17.505
Channing McClaren is a lightweight,
but he gets all the

31:17.507 --> 31:20.842
credit, whilst you stand behind
the curtains pulling the levers.

31:20.844 --> 31:24.913
You know I'm right.

31:31.221 --> 31:35.023
What?

31:35.025 --> 31:37.392
You're such a beautiful girl.

31:37.394 --> 31:38.927
Thank you.

31:38.929 --> 31:41.929
And you're exactly
like your mother.

31:42.932 --> 31:43.931
And the screw turns.

31:43.933 --> 31:46.767
She bitched and moaned
like it was the end of the world

31:46.769 --> 31:48.936
when I first hooked up with
Channing, thought I was throwing

31:48.938 --> 31:51.371
my career away.

31:51.373 --> 31:54.273
This is real
journalism, Miranda.

31:54.275 --> 31:57.009
The old school is
a dying culture.

31:57.011 --> 32:00.480
McClarenTruth...
that's the future.

32:00.482 --> 32:01.747
I thought you would get that.

32:01.749 --> 32:02.748
You're 26.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.083
You grew up with the Internet.

32:04.085 --> 32:06.418
Yeah, but what
about this latest fiasco?

32:06.420 --> 32:07.719
This woman killed herself, Dad.

32:07.721 --> 32:12.624
That was just bad luck, followed
by an unfortunate coincidence.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.726
No, it's an embarrassment.

32:14.728 --> 32:20.299
Your old writer friends in
London are laughing at you.

32:20.301 --> 32:23.936
I'm sorry. I just...
I have to tell you the truth.

32:23.938 --> 32:26.372
And you're drinking too much.

32:28.677 --> 32:32.813
Don't worry
about me, sweetheart.

32:32.815 --> 32:38.185
The new wave is always laughed
at, and then, it takes over.

32:48.262 --> 32:49.696
Venish?

32:49.698 --> 32:51.698
Veneesh.

32:51.700 --> 32:53.032
Sorry about that.

32:53.034 --> 32:55.235
Chris Sanchez.

32:58.607 --> 33:00.774
You do that thing.

33:00.776 --> 33:01.775
What's that?

33:01.777 --> 33:03.910
Like everything's
enemy territory.

33:03.912 --> 33:04.945
You never deployed?

33:04.947 --> 33:06.613
Nah.

33:06.615 --> 33:07.981
Which I'm okay with.

33:07.983 --> 33:09.049
I hear that.

33:09.051 --> 33:10.217
I hear that.

33:10.219 --> 33:11.218
Get you something, honey?

33:11.220 --> 33:13.220
Some coffee, please.

33:13.222 --> 33:14.388
How about you, babe?

33:14.390 --> 33:16.056
- I'm cool.
- Okay.

33:16.058 --> 33:19.126
I appreciate
you meeting with me.

33:19.128 --> 33:20.794
I checked you out.

33:20.796 --> 33:22.363
And?

33:22.365 --> 33:24.431
Here I am.

33:26.634 --> 33:28.068
So what do you want to know?

33:28.070 --> 33:30.571
I understand you
were the tech on a bunch of

33:30.573 --> 33:32.806
video calls between
DC and Ramstein.

33:32.808 --> 33:33.874
Yup.

33:33.876 --> 33:35.576
Patient interviews.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.645
That's right.

33:39.948 --> 33:41.949
Are you willing
to go on record?

33:41.951 --> 33:44.084
And pull
a court-martial?

33:44.086 --> 33:45.853
I don't think so.

33:45.855 --> 33:47.822
Maybe there's been
some kind of misunderstanding.

33:47.824 --> 33:48.823
No, no, no, no.

33:48.825 --> 33:50.158
No misunderstanding.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.761
I wanted to look
you in the eye.

33:52.763 --> 33:55.230
I've never killed anyone, never
been in the shit, but that

33:55.232 --> 33:57.899
doesn't mean I'm less capable
of judging character.

33:57.901 --> 33:59.401
Okay.

33:59.403 --> 34:02.204
You know what the
interviews were about.

34:02.206 --> 34:08.476
What you don't know is that
they were all recorded.

34:08.478 --> 34:09.643
Oh, yeah.

34:09.646 --> 34:11.213
Wonders of digital technology.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.181
Can you get
me those recordings?

34:13.183 --> 34:15.350
No.

34:15.351 --> 34:17.752
But I can tell you
where they're kept.

34:17.754 --> 34:22.121
And give you another name, after
that, you're on your own.

34:35.936 --> 34:38.204
Channing's still gone.

34:38.206 --> 34:41.541
I feel so sorry for you.

34:41.543 --> 34:44.844
You don't know what to do without
your teddy bear, do you?

34:44.846 --> 34:49.815
Dinner with Miranda
went that well, huh?

34:49.818 --> 34:52.252
Give me a kiss.

34:55.056 --> 34:57.157
Give me a kiss.

34:57.159 --> 34:59.159
That better be a bloody joke.

34:59.161 --> 35:00.193
Come on.

35:00.195 --> 35:01.361
Give me a little kiss.

35:01.363 --> 35:05.098
Why don't you lie down,
and I'll get you some water.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.868
You're making a
fool of yourself.

35:09.037 --> 35:11.605
I'm making a fool of myself?

35:11.607 --> 35:15.242
That's fucking rich,
coming from you.

35:15.244 --> 35:17.577
What does that mean?

35:17.579 --> 35:20.147
You've been screwing
the wrong man, Gitta.

35:20.149 --> 35:23.350
What would you say if I told you
all of this, the whole thing,

35:23.352 --> 35:28.855
the-the Web site, the organization,
the whole McClarenTruth.org...

35:28.857 --> 35:31.257
what would you say if I told
you it had nothing to do

35:31.259 --> 35:34.294
with Channing McClaren? Huh?

35:34.296 --> 35:40.067
Your boyfriend's a wonk, a
fucking wonk, nothing more.

35:40.069 --> 35:44.139
He had the skills, he had
the-the connections to the

35:44.141 --> 35:46.775
little techno-worms, and
they had the information.

35:46.777 --> 35:49.812
They had the access to all the
information, but it was me

35:49.814 --> 35:52.448
who had the vision
for all of this.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.250
Yeah, funny little Rutger.

35:54.252 --> 35:56.552
You told me he came
to you with the idea.

35:56.554 --> 35:57.820
Yeah.

35:57.822 --> 36:00.723
Well, I lied.

36:00.725 --> 36:05.429
All part of the
legend, the myth.

36:05.431 --> 36:13.237
Truth is... Truth is...
he came to me years ago.

36:13.239 --> 36:16.607
He had some sensitive
information.

36:16.609 --> 36:19.977
He was shit-scared that he'd
get arrested if he let it out.

36:19.979 --> 36:24.281
So, I guided him, took his
hand every step of the way.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.949
I'm going to bed.

36:25.951 --> 36:28.985
Your boyfriend is a
figurehead, nothing more.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.153
A little puppet.

36:30.155 --> 36:34.824
I needed his face to sell the idea
of the whistle-blower Web site.

36:37.094 --> 36:40.463
You know the funny thing,
we're both the same.

36:40.465 --> 36:43.100
We both fell for the face.

36:45.770 --> 36:48.005
Your career was going
nowhere before you met

36:48.007 --> 36:49.173
Channing, and you know that.

36:49.175 --> 36:52.943
So, no matter how you see things,
you're nothing without him now.

36:52.945 --> 36:55.312
Don't blow a good thing.

36:55.314 --> 36:58.482
Come on, Gitta, how
about a sympathy fuck, huh?

36:58.484 --> 37:00.818
Christ, go to bed.

37:04.591 --> 37:07.124
It is ugly out there and
it is only getting uglier.

37:07.126 --> 37:08.959
Our man, Jason Harris,
is on the street.

37:08.961 --> 37:10.394
Jason, what are you
seeing out there?

37:10.396 --> 37:11.528
Thanks, Jeanette.

37:11.530 --> 37:14.030
As you can see, the winds
have really picked up.

37:14.032 --> 37:18.734
Uh, looks like we got winds at about
25, 30 miles an hour right now.

37:27.577 --> 37:31.413
You want a cheese cracker?

37:31.415 --> 37:34.283
I paid for one, but the
machine gave me two.

37:34.285 --> 37:36.318
Uh, no, thank you.

37:37.488 --> 37:40.422
It's funny, no matter
how much money you have,

37:40.424 --> 37:44.360
it's still exciting
getting free stuff.

37:44.362 --> 37:46.095
Sure you don't want it?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.363
We're gonna be
here for a while.

37:47.365 --> 37:48.764
You got to eat.

37:48.766 --> 37:53.001
I've got a bar.

37:53.003 --> 37:55.036
That's my Ellen.

37:55.038 --> 37:58.306
Always prepared.

37:59.642 --> 38:01.075
Shit.

38:01.077 --> 38:03.678
I hate this thing.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.279
It's the new model.

38:05.281 --> 38:08.582
Just as I figured out the old
one, they change everything.

38:08.584 --> 38:13.887
Do you know how to
work one of these?

38:13.889 --> 38:15.522
What's the problem?

38:15.524 --> 38:17.691
I'm trying to
get to my contacts.

38:17.693 --> 38:20.060
So, I, you know, I press
this button and then...

38:20.062 --> 38:23.731
Now I'm stuck in
some big, fat mess.

38:23.733 --> 38:25.900
You're in your settings menu.

38:25.902 --> 38:28.203
Great. Get me out.

38:28.205 --> 38:30.339
See this button here?

38:30.341 --> 38:31.407
Yeah, I pressed that.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.542
You're three menus in,
so you have to press this

38:33.544 --> 38:38.247
button three times, and then
you're back in your home screen.

38:38.249 --> 38:39.014
Thank you.

38:39.684 --> 38:41.550
You can get to your
contacts list from there.

38:41.552 --> 38:44.353
Mom.

38:44.355 --> 38:46.054
How's the apartment?

38:46.056 --> 38:47.155
It's lovely.

38:47.157 --> 38:48.590
Very nice.

38:48.592 --> 38:50.358
I can't thank you enough.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.693
I'm glad you like it.

38:52.695 --> 38:55.029
It's a little drafty, though.

38:55.031 --> 38:56.564
Where are you?

38:56.566 --> 38:58.266
At a diner.

38:58.268 --> 39:01.169
I didn't want to
eat dinner alone.

39:01.171 --> 39:02.838
At least there are people here.

39:02.840 --> 39:07.509
It always takes a little
while to get used to a new apartment.

39:07.511 --> 39:10.847
Oh, it's a...
it's a great place.

39:10.849 --> 39:11.881
It's just so quiet there.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.217
Honestly, I don't know how I'll
sleep with all that quiet.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.218
It'll be fine, Mom.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.220
Hope so.

39:18.222 --> 39:23.524
My plane's a little delayed, so,
I-I'll check in with you when I get back.

39:23.526 --> 39:24.559
Okay, dear.

39:24.561 --> 39:26.561
Bye.

39:33.302 --> 39:35.336
How's Mom?

39:37.306 --> 39:39.340
She's fine.

39:41.309 --> 39:43.076
Your parents move?

39:43.078 --> 39:47.281
I heard that, you know, something
about a new apartment.

39:47.283 --> 39:51.785
I really don't feel
like talking about my parents.

40:04.432 --> 40:05.865
Hi. It's Patty.

40:05.867 --> 40:08.701
Yeah, my plane's been delayed
for several more hours, so I

40:08.703 --> 40:10.602
just wanted you to know.

40:10.604 --> 40:13.138
How's Catherine?

40:13.140 --> 40:14.639
No, no, no, don't wake her up.

40:14.641 --> 40:16.374
I'll see her when I get back.

40:16.376 --> 40:18.010
Have a good night.

40:18.012 --> 40:21.047
All right.

40:33.162 --> 40:36.764
You need to just sit
down and relax.

40:36.766 --> 40:39.768
I hate waiting.

40:43.072 --> 40:45.106
You need a drink.

40:48.878 --> 40:50.912
Bar's closed.

40:53.816 --> 40:56.351
Shame.

41:01.058 --> 41:03.158
Hey, Rutger, wake up.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.693
I got something.

41:04.695 --> 41:05.728
Hey, what's up?

41:05.730 --> 41:07.863
I talked to Bruce Davies.

41:07.865 --> 41:09.164
He gave me some information.

41:09.166 --> 41:10.633
What information?

41:10.635 --> 41:12.735
He gave me the
name of the guy who was

41:12.737 --> 41:15.772
supplying Fund 23
with stock tips.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.006
Who?

41:17.008 --> 41:20.077
Helmut Torben.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.747
You heard of him?

41:30.756 --> 41:34.092
Never seen him
before in my life.

42:24.878 --> 42:29.415
- Do mind if I...
- Of course not.

42:36.255 --> 42:39.391
Nice, isn't it?

42:39.393 --> 42:42.194
What?

42:42.196 --> 42:44.997
The quiet.

42:50.939 --> 42:52.773
The unexpected downtime.

42:52.775 --> 42:55.643
Being able to catch up on work.

42:55.645 --> 42:57.278
Actually read.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.780
It's really relaxing.

43:02.051 --> 43:05.186
I know what you mean.

43:26.678 --> 43:28.011
What are you doing?

43:28.013 --> 43:30.180
I'm gonna get you a drink.

43:30.182 --> 43:33.516
Keep an eye out.

43:33.518 --> 43:35.685
You really gonna do this?

43:35.687 --> 43:38.854
You really need a drink.

43:42.525 --> 43:43.525
What do you think?

43:44.161 --> 43:46.461
If you're gonna
do it, just do it.

43:46.463 --> 43:50.598
Don't talk about it.

43:52.335 --> 43:53.468
Stop it.

43:53.470 --> 43:54.836
Patty, he's coming.

43:54.838 --> 43:55.870
Patty, Patty!

43:55.872 --> 43:57.539
Hey there.

43:57.541 --> 43:58.740
Hey.

43:58.742 --> 44:00.742
Well, the fuel line is fixed.

44:00.744 --> 44:02.277
Thank God.

44:02.279 --> 44:04.313
But I'm afraid we
still can't leave.

44:04.315 --> 44:06.615
Our window to take
off has closed.

44:06.617 --> 44:07.716
The storm's moving in.

44:07.718 --> 44:10.352
It's already dumped eight
inches in Vermont.

44:10.354 --> 44:12.555
Thank you for the update.

44:12.557 --> 44:14.524
How long will it be?

44:14.526 --> 44:18.127
I really can't say.

44:18.129 --> 44:20.562
Very sorry, Ms. Hewes.

44:20.564 --> 44:21.797
Thank you, Captain.

44:21.799 --> 44:24.832
Thank you.

44:50.056 --> 44:52.524
You've been supplying
illegal stock tips to Fund 23.

44:52.526 --> 44:54.994
You've made them millions.

44:54.996 --> 44:57.095
Who tells you this?

44:57.097 --> 44:59.865
Bruce Davies sold
you out to McClaren.

44:59.867 --> 45:02.401
Davies can prove nothing.

45:02.403 --> 45:05.003
And why is this any
concern of yours?

45:05.005 --> 45:07.005
We're fucked if
this ever gets out there.

45:07.007 --> 45:08.507
That's right.

45:08.509 --> 45:18.282
So I'm confident that you will see to it
that nothing comes of this information.

45:18.284 --> 45:20.684
Channing'll want to pursue it.

45:20.686 --> 45:21.685
Don't let him.

45:21.687 --> 45:24.688
What makes you think
I even want to protect you?

45:24.690 --> 45:30.059
Because you have secrets
of your own, Mr. Simon.

45:56.986 --> 46:08.564
So... really...
how is your mom?

46:08.566 --> 46:13.536
I already told you, Patty, I
don't feel like talking about my parents.

46:13.538 --> 46:16.874
I'm just trying
to make conversation.

46:16.876 --> 46:19.110
Ellen, we're stuck here.

46:19.112 --> 46:23.348
I mean, we may as well chat.

46:23.350 --> 46:24.516
Okay, Patty.

46:24.518 --> 46:26.618
Uh... go ahead.

46:26.620 --> 46:30.089
Let's discuss whatever's
on your mind.

46:30.091 --> 46:33.159
Ask away.

46:36.897 --> 46:39.932
Okay.

46:50.210 --> 46:52.879
What was your parents' secret?

46:52.881 --> 46:54.714
With what?

46:54.716 --> 46:57.082
You.

46:57.084 --> 46:59.018
How'd they pull it off?

46:59.020 --> 47:04.922
How do you raise a kid to grow
up to be someone like you?

47:04.924 --> 47:10.628
Uh, well, in my parents' case,
by being abusive and dysfunctional.

47:10.630 --> 47:13.563
I think you're
being hard on them.

47:13.565 --> 47:15.832
Look at how you turned out.

47:15.834 --> 47:19.069
You know what
that phone call was about?

47:19.071 --> 47:22.606
My mother has left my father.

47:22.608 --> 47:28.178
And she moved in with me, but I've
gotten her her own place now.

47:28.180 --> 47:31.449
Why did she leave your father?

47:31.451 --> 47:35.453
Because he's a tyrant...
who blames the world

47:35.455 --> 47:39.858
for his frustrations, and he
would take it out on her, and

47:39.860 --> 47:45.398
she couldn't handle it anymore.

47:45.400 --> 47:48.502
So there you go.

47:53.441 --> 47:57.011
Have I ever told
you about my father?

47:57.013 --> 48:01.148
Yeah, you did.

48:01.150 --> 48:03.451
What did I say?

48:03.453 --> 48:07.722
Said he was an angry bully and
that he ran out on you and your mom.

48:07.724 --> 48:10.591
Yeah.

48:10.593 --> 48:13.395
He left and he never came back.

48:13.397 --> 48:14.663
Never?

48:14.665 --> 48:17.233
Never.

48:17.235 --> 48:20.670
Well, you never mentioned that.

48:20.672 --> 48:22.171
How old were you, when he left?

48:22.173 --> 48:25.041
Thirteen.

48:25.043 --> 48:27.043
And you never saw him again?

48:27.045 --> 48:31.849
No.

48:31.851 --> 48:36.254
So...

48:36.256 --> 48:42.060
For all our differences, you
and I have a lot in common.

48:42.062 --> 48:44.663
I don't think so.

48:44.665 --> 48:48.667
We understand each other.

48:48.669 --> 48:54.974
Maybe our paths were
meant to cross.

48:54.976 --> 48:59.178
I think there's a reason why
you and I found each other.

48:59.180 --> 49:01.814
"Found each other"?

49:01.816 --> 49:03.282
Are you kidding?

49:03.284 --> 49:06.285
Oh, you don't believe...
you don't believe things like that?

49:06.287 --> 49:08.354
Our paths crossed
because you needed Katie Connor

49:08.356 --> 49:10.924
as a witness against Frobisher.

49:10.926 --> 49:18.031
There was no fate or destiny,
there was only manipulation.

49:18.033 --> 49:24.838
You used my personal relationships
for leverage in your case.

49:24.840 --> 49:28.642
But you stuck around.

49:28.644 --> 49:32.813
Or, more incredibly,
I kept you around.

49:32.815 --> 49:35.248
Even after you'd
served your purpose.

49:35.250 --> 49:38.418
And here we are.

49:38.420 --> 49:47.460
You and I, alone in an airport,
still together, Ellen.

49:49.965 --> 49:56.336
We're not here because you've
got some kind of hold over me, Patty.

49:56.338 --> 49:58.672
We're here because I was going
to testify against you in

49:58.674 --> 50:01.141
Catherine's custody case.

50:01.143 --> 50:04.677
And you needed a way to keep me
off the stand, so you created a

50:04.679 --> 50:07.580
suit for us to try
against each other.

50:07.582 --> 50:09.382
I created a case?

50:09.384 --> 50:12.451
You sent Channing
McClaren to me as a client,

50:12.453 --> 50:17.689
knowing that you would sue him.

50:17.691 --> 50:20.659
But you can't stop me, Patty.

50:20.661 --> 50:24.129
When the McClaren case is over,
the custody trial will continue,

50:24.131 --> 50:26.298
and I will testify against you.

50:26.300 --> 50:28.567
And what will you say?

50:28.569 --> 50:32.404
What is the worst thing
that you know about me?

50:32.406 --> 50:37.843
You know what that is.

50:37.845 --> 50:43.014
That we blackmailed Ray Fiske.

50:43.016 --> 50:46.984
That was terrible.

50:46.986 --> 50:49.487
Ray was my friend.

50:52.591 --> 50:57.962
That's a secret that you and
I will be burdened with.

50:57.964 --> 51:05.904
But, Ellen, if you testify about that,
you'll have to implicate yourself.

51:05.906 --> 51:10.910
And there's nothing else
you have that can hurt me.

51:10.912 --> 51:12.445
I have nothing else?

51:12.447 --> 51:13.446
What?

51:13.448 --> 51:16.883
What is it you think
that you know about me?

51:16.885 --> 51:20.553
Are you fucking crazy?

51:20.555 --> 51:25.825
What?

51:25.827 --> 51:27.327
The High Star case?

51:27.329 --> 51:29.395
Are you still angry about that?

51:29.397 --> 51:33.699
What?

51:33.701 --> 51:37.203
You confessed to me.

51:37.205 --> 51:38.804
Confessed what?

51:38.806 --> 51:41.340
In the hotel room.

51:41.342 --> 51:47.179
You admitted what you
tried to do to me.

51:47.181 --> 51:49.982
That's what
you're talking about?

51:49.984 --> 51:51.250
Yes, Patty.

51:51.252 --> 51:52.351
That.

51:52.353 --> 51:55.253
You had me at gunpoint.

51:55.255 --> 51:57.889
I would have said anything.

51:57.891 --> 52:01.292
I told you what you wanted to hear so
you would take the money to the judge.

52:01.294 --> 52:06.363
I was just trying
to win a case.

52:06.365 --> 52:09.433
You never realized that?

52:12.403 --> 52:15.204
You believed me?

52:15.206 --> 52:23.646
All this time you have believed that I
would actually try to have you killed?

52:23.648 --> 52:25.648
I believe it
because it happened.

52:26.818 --> 52:29.820
Then wh-why on earth did
you come back and work for me?

52:29.822 --> 52:30.821
I worked <i>with</i> you.

52:30.823 --> 52:32.956
After that, I never
worked for you.

52:32.958 --> 52:35.659
Ellen...
I am so sorry that you have been

52:35.661 --> 52:41.764
operating under this...
terrible false assumption.

52:41.766 --> 52:46.201
After Ray Fiske shot himself,
you asked me if I regretted what we did.

52:46.203 --> 52:47.235
Oh, my God.

52:47.237 --> 52:48.236
And I said yes.

52:48.238 --> 52:51.673
Then you inexplicably left town, and
I was attacked in your apartment.

52:51.675 --> 52:53.808
How does any of that
suggest I was responsible?

52:53.810 --> 52:55.776
If not you, then who?

52:55.778 --> 53:05.052
Well, I imagine, uh...
that Frobisher sent somebody for me.

53:05.054 --> 53:07.688
But you were staying
at my apartment.

53:07.690 --> 53:09.790
So you were
supposed to be the victim?

53:09.792 --> 53:13.294
The intended.

53:13.296 --> 53:19.934
- If it wasn't Frobisher...
- Then what?

53:19.936 --> 53:24.006
Believe me, Ellen, I
have thought a lot about this.

53:24.008 --> 53:27.176
And I think there may
be another possibility.

53:27.178 --> 53:29.478
Who?

53:29.480 --> 53:31.981
Pete.

53:31.983 --> 53:36.686
He may have acted on his own
in order to protect me.

53:36.688 --> 53:40.589
He knew I was vulnerable
to you because of Fiske.

53:40.591 --> 53:43.792
Pete was fiercely loyal to me.

53:43.794 --> 53:48.529
I think he may have taken
things in his own hands.

53:48.531 --> 53:51.699
You confessed to me, Patty.

53:51.701 --> 53:53.868
You gave me no choice.

53:53.870 --> 53:57.772
Only one answer would
have satisfied you.

53:57.774 --> 54:00.942
I was in that room, Patty.

54:00.944 --> 54:05.880
I saw those tears in your eyes.

54:05.882 --> 54:07.916
You're saying you can sit there
now, look me in the eye, and

54:07.918 --> 54:10.285
tell me I made the
whole thing up?

54:10.287 --> 54:12.220
Ms. Hewes?

54:12.222 --> 54:13.521
Things cleared up a bit.

54:13.523 --> 54:14.522
We're good to go.

54:14.524 --> 54:15.524
Wonderful.

54:15.526 --> 54:16.558
Thank you.

54:38.013 --> 54:41.916
Are you coming?

54:41.918 --> 54:43.050
No, Patty.

54:43.052 --> 54:47.355
I'm not coming with you.

54:47.357 --> 54:50.758
I'm sorry about the
misunderstanding, Ellen.
