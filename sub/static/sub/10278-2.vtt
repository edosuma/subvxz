E. R.

00:06.499 --> 00:07.800
Previously on E.R.

00:07.801 --> 00:09.929
Abby, you're seen things.

00:09.930 --> 00:12.786
Maybe you're on drugs.
I thin0k I saw you with a needle once.

00:12.787 --> 00:14.165
I'll work it out with the registrar-

00:14.200 --> 00:16.033
Once a clerkship is pulled, it's pulled.

00:16.068 --> 00:18.503
Nothing I can do. You have to wait
till the next academyc quarter.

00:18.504 --> 00:21.081
I just lost three months of med school.
Three months I can't make up...

00:21.082 --> 00:23.276
- This is about your tuition.
- Yes, it is about my tuition!

00:23.277 --> 00:25.864
If I'm gonna give you a faculty position,
I've gotta be sure...

00:25.865 --> 00:27.337
that you are gonna be part of the team.

00:27.338 --> 00:30.534
You are having a boy. Congratulations.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.639
Thank you.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.912
- Did you catch her?
- Oh, yes, I caught her.

00:56.083 --> 00:58.955
But once she starts writing,
she can't stop. Heaven forbid.

00:59.129 --> 01:02.166
I should have jammed that pen
into her carotid artery.

01:02.342 --> 01:04.964
They double the fine
once you draw blood.

01:05.138 --> 01:07.712
You need a building with guest parking.

01:07.891 --> 01:11.226
- Take my spot.
- I don't want your spot.

01:13.859 --> 01:15.139
Damn!

01:15.319 --> 01:16.730
What?

01:17.655 --> 01:19.696
No milk.

01:20.284 --> 01:21.613
Want some of mine?

01:21.686 --> 01:25.406
A grown man. You put an empty milk carton
back into the refrigerator.

01:25.583 --> 01:27.826
It's not empty.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.376
Now it's empty.

01:32.551 --> 01:36.301
Not that it chills anything cooler
than room temperature, anyway.

01:36.474 --> 01:38.930
- It's just a parking ticket.
- It's not the ticket.

01:39.002 --> 01:42.307
I had to go chasing down
there half-dressed with my hair wet.

01:42.482 --> 01:44.522
- I said I'd go.
- But you didn't, did you?

01:44.693 --> 01:48.111
- You didn't give me a chance.
- You weren't fast enough!

01:48.782 --> 01:54.574
I'll pay the ticket. Okay?
Calm down. I paid the other ones.

01:58.338 --> 01:59.832
What?

02:02.677 --> 02:05.216
Let's just say
it wasn't your first ticket.

02:05.389 --> 02:08.261
- You stole tickets off my windshield?
- Two.

02:08.435 --> 02:12.304
- And paid them without telling me?
- I was trying to avoid this.

02:13.317 --> 02:16.023
- I'm not staying here anymore.
- Here we go.

02:16.196 --> 02:19.531
- Every faucet leaks, your toilet rocks.
- I like that.

02:19.701 --> 02:24.365
There are creatures in the walls.
Do you know what scurries in walls?

02:24.541 --> 02:26.249
Bunnies?

02:27.546 --> 02:31.046
Do you want to take the El train,
or shall we drive?

02:38.019 --> 02:40.475
- Is this the AA meeting?
- How'd you guess?

02:40.647 --> 02:42.308
- I'm Brant.
- Hi, I'm John.

02:42.483 --> 02:45.058
Thanks, John. Welcome.

02:45.237 --> 02:48.980
...to believe a power greater than
ourselves could restore us to sanity.

02:49.535 --> 02:52.537
Step Three: Made a decision
to turn our will...

02:52.706 --> 02:54.700
- A lot of coffee.
- This is backup.

02:55.835 --> 02:57.745
- First time?
- Here? Yeah.

02:57.921 --> 02:59.121
It's a good group.

02:59.199 --> 03:02.834
...a searching and fearless
moral inventory of ourselves.

03:03.012 --> 03:06.264
Step Five: Admitted to God,
to ourselves...

03:06.434 --> 03:09.769
...and to another human being
the nature of our wrongs.

03:11.274 --> 03:14.441
Step Six: Were entirely
ready to have God...

03:14.611 --> 03:17.530
...remove all of these
defects of character.

03:17.699 --> 03:21.616
Step Seven: Humbly asked him
to remove our shortcomings.

03:22.414 --> 03:26.621
Step Eight: Made a list of all persons
whom we have harmed...

03:26.622 --> 03:30.625
...and became willing
to make amends to them all.

03:30.802 --> 03:35.014
Step Nine: Made direct amends
to such people wherever possible...

03:35.182 --> 03:38.101
...except when to do so
would harm them or others.

04:26.131 --> 04:28.206
E.R.

04:29.396 --> 04:31.852
Take this guy.
He is driving me crazy.

04:32.024 --> 04:33.567
- Same here.
- Oh, no.

04:33.735 --> 04:36.227
He missed his dialysis appointment.

04:36.405 --> 04:38.731
Mr. Fletcher, only one day late?

04:38.908 --> 04:40.904
- You? No, not you.
- You know him?

04:41.080 --> 04:46.076
He's one of our favorites.
Hey, Cleo? Can you take Mr. Fletcher?

04:47.213 --> 04:51.295
- I see you called 911 again.
- They're faster than the El train.

04:51.469 --> 04:54.305
- My arm stopped buzzing.
- No thrill, no bruit.

04:54.473 --> 04:55.850
Talk English.

04:57.436 --> 04:59.430
- Mark, ready?
- In a second.

04:59.606 --> 05:01.933
- Raise your right foot.
- I can't.

05:02.110 --> 05:04.732
- I don't want to keep him waiting.
- I'll be there.

05:05.491 --> 05:06.605
Okay.

05:07.660 --> 05:11.280
- Have you started teaching rounds?
- No. The residents are waiting in ICU.

05:11.457 --> 05:12.489
All right, tell them
I'll be there in a minute.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.909
And you need to schedule the surgical
service committee meeting.

05:15.087 --> 05:16.713
- Tomorrow.
- You have a mastectomy.

05:16.881 --> 05:19.588
- Well, whenever.
- Dr. Benton.

05:19.803 --> 05:23.008
- Carter. What are you doing here?
- I have a meeting.

05:23.183 --> 05:24.843
- Right.
- Hi, Shirley.

05:25.018 --> 05:29.398
Hi. I need you to sign off
on last month's O.R. expenditure report.

05:29.567 --> 05:33.613
- I've never done that.
- I take care of it. You just sign it.

05:34.741 --> 05:38.326
Suit yourself. I need it by 4.
It's good to see you, Carter.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.623
Important Attending stuff?

05:43.838 --> 05:45.463
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

05:45.632 --> 05:48.303
Thanks. Man, you look good.

05:49.513 --> 05:51.672
Couldn't look much worse
than the last time.

05:52.641 --> 05:54.386
- He's gotten big.
- Yeah.

05:55.229 --> 05:57.519
- Hi, Reece.
- Hey.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.729
Well, hey, you're in a hurry...

06:03.157 --> 06:08.236
- Yeah. I'll see you later, all right?
- I don't know. Maybe. We'll see.

06:09.542 --> 06:11.784
Good luck, Carter.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.174
- When does he want to start?
- Soon.

06:17.345 --> 06:18.377
I don't think that's a good idea.

06:18.555 --> 06:20.300
62-year-old female, slurred speech,

06:20.475 --> 06:22.385
also weak grip in right hand.

06:22.561 --> 06:26.561
- Any history of stroke?
- Yes. A lacunar infarct. She got worse.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.404
- He's eager to work.
- So we just throw him in?

06:29.570 --> 06:33.321
We'll start him on half-shifts,
limited responsibilities.

06:33.493 --> 06:37.031
- In the same place he started using.
- He's doing the program every day.

06:37.208 --> 06:39.616
Good. Make him take time.
He can afford it.

06:39.794 --> 06:44.090
We'll monitor his progress.
If he gets into trouble, we'll cut back.

06:44.259 --> 06:45.885
If he gets in trouble, it's too late.

06:46.054 --> 06:47.798
Please, somebody!

06:47.973 --> 06:49.800
- What?
- I'm having contractions!

06:49.975 --> 06:51.720
- Are you pregnant?
- Only 22 weeks.

06:51.895 --> 06:55.942
Come here. Try to relax, okay?
Here, you're gonna sit down.

06:56.820 --> 06:59.312
Sit here. Wait one second, okay?

07:00.449 --> 07:03.618
Dr. Chen, I need you over here.
No, now.

07:03.788 --> 07:06.659
- How did you get here?
- Taxi. I was shopping.

07:06.834 --> 07:08.626
- What?
- She's having contractions.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.168
- How far along are you?
-22 weeks.

07:11.340 --> 07:15.257
You're probably having what are called
Braxton Hicks contractions.

07:15.430 --> 07:17.887
They're coming every three minutes.

07:18.059 --> 07:22.105
Get a gurney, clear a trauma room,
start an IV and call OB.

07:22.273 --> 07:23.768
- What's your name?
- Regina.

07:23.942 --> 07:29.568
Regina, don't push.
Whatever you do, don't push. Okay?

07:31.161 --> 07:33.238
- How much?
- Four, almost 5.

07:33.414 --> 07:36.915
That can't be right.
I was 4 centimeters two hours ago.

07:37.087 --> 07:39.544
- You're doing fine.
- Can Dr. Coburn take a look?

07:39.716 --> 07:41.756
She was called in to do a C-section.

07:41.968 --> 07:44.259
- How long will that take?
- We have time.

07:44.431 --> 07:48.809
Why don't we roll you on your side
and get you more comfortable.

07:49.146 --> 07:52.017
Abby, they need someone downstairs.

07:52.191 --> 07:54.946
- Where?
- ER. They have a preterm labor.

07:55.114 --> 07:57.403
- Get a resident.
- Simons and Perry are delivering.

07:57.575 --> 07:59.283
Lift your leg. Where's Dana?

07:59.453 --> 08:01.577
She's on break. Not back for another five.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.573
- You're not leaving?
- It sounded urgent.

08:06.296 --> 08:09.416
Do you know where you are,
Mrs. Walton?

08:12.137 --> 08:13.799
Let the doctor check you first.

08:14.141 --> 08:15.173
What does she say?

08:15.352 --> 08:17.760
- She wants to go home.
- Pulse ox is 92.

08:19.690 --> 08:23.393
She's in A-fib.
It probably triggered the new stroke.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.360
- Do you provide 24-hour care?
- Yes.

08:26.534 --> 08:30.532
- Does she have any family?
- No. Not that she's in contact with.

08:30.706 --> 08:32.784
- Connie, call Psych.
- Psych?

08:34.044 --> 08:39.172
After this she might not be competent
to make her own medical decisions.

08:42.182 --> 08:44.341
- Preterm labor?
- Next door.

08:44.518 --> 08:48.600
EKG, Chem-7, UA, culture urine,
blood and sputum.

08:48.774 --> 08:50.566
- Your husband's on his way.
- Ok.

08:50.735 --> 08:52.777
- How far along?
- Twenty-two weeks.

08:52.948 --> 08:56.318
- Let's hope it's a couple more.
- Please, stop it!

08:56.494 --> 08:58.784
- Where's the resident?
- You got me instead.

08:58.956 --> 09:03.122
Membranes are intact, but she's fully
dilated to 6 centimeters.

09:03.296 --> 09:05.289
Can you stop it?

09:05.465 --> 09:06.924
- What's her name?
- Regina.

09:07.092 --> 09:12.338
- Regina, did you have any ultrasounds?
- My doctor said everything was okay.

09:12.518 --> 09:15.306
- Who's your doctor?
- He's in Indianapolis.

09:15.481 --> 09:17.059
Why is this happening?

09:17.233 --> 09:20.650
Sometimes women
go into preterm labor for no reason.

09:20.821 --> 09:26.066
- I should have stayed home.
- This is not your fault. This happens.

09:26.246 --> 09:28.155
Ok, we are giving you medicine
to stop de contractions.

09:28.332 --> 09:30.622
Your membranes haven't ruptured yet,
which is a good sign.

09:30.794 --> 09:34.165
We're also giving you something
to help your baby's lungs mature.

09:34.342 --> 09:37.213
No! I feel pressure.

09:39.474 --> 09:42.013
- Contraction.
- She's leaking amniotic fluid.

09:42.186 --> 09:45.687
- Make them stop. It's too early.
- Two grams of amp.

09:45.983 --> 09:49.732
- Get a baby warmer in here.
- No! It's too early!

09:59.361 --> 10:02.962
- Random urine tests.
- Yes.

10:03.759 --> 10:05.883
And I get to pay for them too, I see.

10:06.054 --> 10:09.091
- Is that a problem?
- No.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.471
In addition to the state meetings...

10:12.648 --> 10:16.813
...we'll require 90 NA or AA meetings
during the first 90 days.

10:17.488 --> 10:20.406
- That's not a problem. I'm going anyway.
- Good.

10:20.575 --> 10:23.613
And the three of us
will meet once a week just to...

10:23.788 --> 10:26.743
...check in. Make sure
you're handling the stress.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.329
Okay.

10:30.173 --> 10:31.502
I came prepared.

10:32.802 --> 10:35.590
- The naltrexone binds to your opiate-
- I know what it does.

10:39.311 --> 10:42.229
It protects you.
It blocks the euphoric effects.

10:42.398 --> 10:44.060
It protects all of us.

10:48.993 --> 10:54.120
You need to begin today
if you want to begin work next week.

11:01.093 --> 11:05.804
- You want me to take it in front of you?
- We'll monitor your regimen.

11:08.145 --> 11:10.934
- How much?
- Fifty milligrams a day.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.746
- Sorry. That was...
- It's okay.

11:24.919 --> 11:28.373
It's gonna be difficult at first.
We'll work it out.

11:30.637 --> 11:34.303
We'll put you on the schedule
for next week. Tuesday.

11:34.475 --> 11:36.967
Start out very light. No trauma.

11:37.479 --> 11:38.642
Whatever you say.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.731
- Kerry, I gotta go.
- Yeah.

11:41.903 --> 11:43.563
- See you.
- Welcome back.

11:43.738 --> 11:45.446
Thank you.

11:46.409 --> 11:50.539
- Thank you both.
- Sure thing.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.874
Baby's cephalic. Normal anatomy.

12:00.054 --> 12:02.725
- Progressed to 8.
- Please stop it.

12:02.891 --> 12:05.644
- Father's here.
- Regina, what happened?

12:05.812 --> 12:09.183
I was at the mall. It started hurting.
I didn't know what to do.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.982
- Is she in labor?
- My water broke.

12:12.155 --> 12:15.490
Her OB confirms previous
ultrasounds put her at 21 weeks.

12:15.910 --> 12:17.869
- That's too soon.
- She's got rales.

12:18.039 --> 12:21.373
- Pulmonary edema. No more terbutaline.
- What's wrong?

12:21.543 --> 12:24.665
The medication is causing
your lungs to fill.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.083
I don't care! Stop the contractions!

12:27.386 --> 12:30.822
I can't have this baby.
- I'll try 50 mgs of indomethacin.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.592
If the baby's born, can it survive?

12:33.770 --> 12:35.894
- It's coming!
- The baby's crowning.

12:36.065 --> 12:38.937
- You're gonna deliver this baby.
- No! No!

12:39.011 --> 12:41.817
Yes. There's nothing else we can do.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.817
- What have we got?
- Preemie.

12:43.993 --> 12:47.079
- Okay. Regina, go ahead and push.
- No! No!

12:47.248 --> 12:50.785
- You okay there, Dr. Chen?
- The head's out.

12:50.962 --> 12:53.536
- My God! My God!
- It's a boy.

12:53.715 --> 12:56.006
- Is he breathing?
- Yes.

12:56.178 --> 12:58.301
- Can someone help me?
- You okay?

12:59.140 --> 13:01.811
Dilute it in 1000 cc's,
100 drops per minute.

13:01.978 --> 13:04.814
- I don't hear anything. Is he alive?
- Yes.

13:04.983 --> 13:07.142
Let's get a weight.

13:08.487 --> 13:11.194
- He's so little.
- BP, 100/60.

13:11.367 --> 13:14.903
Okay. Let's give the mom 40 of Lasix.
Take her temp.

13:15.080 --> 13:19.910
Please save him.
Please save my baby.

13:27.700 --> 13:29.428
You're doing charts?

13:30.136 --> 13:32.145
Yeah, I needed to catch up.

13:36.996 --> 13:41.424
Look, I'm really sorry about...
With the baby.

13:42.504 --> 13:45.576
It's all right. Our reactions
can surprise us sometimes.

13:45.884 --> 13:49.953
But you need to go back in there
and manage your patient.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.529
I can't.

13:52.603 --> 13:56.552
You should know you're being
considered for chief resident next year.

13:56.899 --> 14:01.013
People need to be able
to look to you for leadership.

14:03.744 --> 14:05.439
I'm pregnant.

14:08.784 --> 14:10.498
I didn't know what to do...

14:10.533 --> 14:15.576
...and then eight weeks became 12
and 12 became 20.

14:16.624 --> 14:19.709
So you're 20 weeks pregnant?

14:20.378 --> 14:22.252
Twenty-two.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.464
You know, that baby
was the size of mine.

14:28.346 --> 14:30.257
Oh, sweetie...

14:33.102 --> 14:36.804
Why did you wait so long to tell me?

14:38.943 --> 14:41.945
My parents are gonna kill me.

14:42.198 --> 14:43.673
- You should go home.
- No.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.779
Go home.
I'll cover the rest of your shift.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.622
We'll work out your schedule
tomorrow.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.118
Okay.

14:53.586 --> 14:54.665
Good.

14:56.966 --> 15:00.964
- Not fair. Not in the workplace.
- I found a spot I'm going to exploit.

15:01.138 --> 15:03.807
- I'll exploit you. You know I will.
- Bring it on.

15:03.974 --> 15:05.006
Time and place.

15:05.184 --> 15:07.972
Clotted-off fistula needs a new shunt.

15:08.146 --> 15:10.816
- Renal failure?
- Missed his dialysis.

15:10.983 --> 15:12.146
- Mr. Fletcher?
- Who else?

15:12.318 --> 15:14.988
- Give him to somebody else.
- I got stuck with him.

15:15.155 --> 15:19.402
- The man yelled in my stethoscope.
- He grabbed my ass. Suck it up.

15:19.577 --> 15:21.285
Come on. Be a man.

15:25.459 --> 15:27.001
- That's not right.
- You crying?

15:27.169 --> 15:28.713
That's not right.

15:29.590 --> 15:31.878
- You guys got a baby?
-22-week preemie.

15:32.050 --> 15:34.339
- Still breathing?
- For now.

15:34.511 --> 15:37.003
What took you so long?
I need to take a dump.

15:37.181 --> 15:38.725
It's good to see you, Mr. Fletcher.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.051
- Is he hypothermic?
- Yeah.

15:41.229 --> 15:44.396
- Okay. Order another lamp.
- It's on its way down.

15:49.823 --> 15:53.691
- What's his pulse?
- Down to 90.

15:54.871 --> 16:00.247
This is some heated saline to keep him
warm while you hold him.

16:02.380 --> 16:06.129
- Did your husband leave?
- He went to call a priest.

16:06.552 --> 16:09.221
We want to baptize our baby.

16:10.890 --> 16:13.216
There's a priest on call with the hospital,

16:13.477 --> 16:15.933
unless you had someone specific in mind.

16:16.105 --> 16:19.558
No, we're just in town
for a few days.

16:19.734 --> 16:24.730
My doctor said I could travel
during my second trimester.

16:27.537 --> 16:32.365
This probably would have happened
whether you were traveling or not.

16:32.918 --> 16:35.409
We tried for...

16:35.587 --> 16:39.503
...almost two years to get pregnant
and finally gave up.

16:40.260 --> 16:44.211
And then suddenly, I was.

16:45.433 --> 16:48.850
Look at him. He's hanging on.

16:50.189 --> 16:55.529
I counted 10 little fingers
and 10 little toes.

16:55.696 --> 16:58.533
He looks perfect.

17:00.244 --> 17:03.448
He's just a little small.

17:09.213 --> 17:12.963
Even if your baby was a few weeks older
and somehow managed to survive-

17:13.135 --> 17:17.929
I know that that's what you say
because that's what you've seen...

17:18.099 --> 17:21.598
...but maybe he's meant
to be a miracle.

17:22.480 --> 17:26.395
Sometimes you have
to help a miracle along.

17:28.109 --> 17:31.030
And sometimes you have to let go.

17:31.783 --> 17:34.405
- What took so long?
- They had us holding.

17:34.578 --> 17:37.864
- Are we still in Trauma 1?
- Yeah, sure.

17:38.499 --> 17:39.995
How bad is it?

17:40.169 --> 17:43.834
- I'm not sure I should discuss this.
- Why?

17:44.006 --> 17:47.376
I can't share medical information
with anyone but family.

17:47.552 --> 17:50.127
- Glenda and I are family.
- I thought you were her nurse.

17:50.305 --> 17:52.345
No, I'm-

17:55.311 --> 17:56.890
We're partners.

17:58.316 --> 17:59.857
Right.

18:00.861 --> 18:03.269
We should sit down.

18:09.245 --> 18:11.820
- Hey.
- You're safe. I've had my coffee.

18:11.999 --> 18:15.333
- Good. How about a date?
- As long as it's at my place.

18:15.503 --> 18:17.829
- The going-out kind.
- We're going out Friday.

18:18.007 --> 18:19.715
I moved up a reservation.

18:19.884 --> 18:22.043
- What reservation?
- It's a surprise.

18:22.220 --> 18:25.257
Look, I'm fine. I just had
an episode this morning.

18:25.432 --> 18:29.383
I know. I'm used to them.
Trust me. You'll like the place.

18:29.562 --> 18:32.599
Your patient has an abscess
around L4 and L5.

18:32.775 --> 18:36.061
- Who?
- Patterson. I was in Radiology.

18:36.237 --> 18:37.437
- Bored?
- What?

18:37.615 --> 18:39.026
Poaching my patients?

18:39.200 --> 18:43.329
There can be improvement
in the first 24 hours after a stroke.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.747
In Glenda's case, I'm afraid
there's too much brain damage.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.710
- She won't recover?
- Maybe slightly.

18:49.337 --> 18:52.006
Dr. Kovac?
Her sats are dropping to 86.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.632
- Glenda?
- Yes.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.586
- What does that mean?
- She's not getting enough oxygen.

18:59.642 --> 19:04.055
- Eight ET tube, 10 cc syringe.
- BP's 110/90. Pulse is 110.

19:04.231 --> 19:07.682
- Put her on a 100% non-rebreather.
- This your patient?

19:07.859 --> 19:10.530
Large CVA with dense hemiparesis.

19:10.697 --> 19:13.318
X- ray shows an aspiration pneumonia.

19:13.533 --> 19:17.995
We may have to put a tube
down your throat to help you breathe.

19:19.208 --> 19:22.125
- Do you know where you are?
- She's not competent.

19:22.294 --> 19:25.048
- She's confused.
- Does she have an advance directive?

19:25.216 --> 19:27.671
- What do you mean?
- Like a "Do Not Resuscitate" order.

19:27.843 --> 19:30.417
I don't think she'd want a ventilator.

19:30.596 --> 19:32.470
Suction. I'll put in an airway.

19:32.640 --> 19:35.643
- Are you a family member?
- No, she's her...

19:36.688 --> 19:38.183
They're together.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.443
- Do you have power of attorney?
- No, I guess I should...

19:42.612 --> 19:46.278
- Sats are climbing.
- Let's keep her on 50 liters by mask.

19:46.784 --> 19:48.906
- She's okay?
- For now.

19:49.077 --> 19:51.783
But we'll have to intubate her...

19:51.957 --> 19:54.828
unless a family member directs us not to.

19:55.628 --> 19:59.044
- Or a spouse?
- One recognized by law.

20:05.890 --> 20:07.800
- Can you do it by phone?
- Yes.

20:07.976 --> 20:11.226
Yes, if you can verify
an out-of-town relative.

20:12.064 --> 20:14.984
She has a brother in Houston.

20:15.152 --> 20:18.320
I've never seen one so small.
You can hold it in one hand.

20:18.490 --> 20:21.859
I delivered a 700-gram baby
in med school. Had a brain-bleed.

20:22.035 --> 20:25.155
- I don't even want to look.
- Can you page the chaplain?

20:25.331 --> 20:28.452
The father already asked.
He's gonna be a few hours.

20:28.627 --> 20:31.165
Well, we don't have a few hours.
He needs to get here.

20:31.338 --> 20:34.506
Well, he's helping talk down
a jumper. I...

20:34.676 --> 20:38.461
Then start calling parishes till you can find
someone who can get over here.

20:38.640 --> 20:41.807
- You want me to cold-call priests?
- Yes. Now, please.

20:41.977 --> 20:44.433
- Okay.
- No, I just need the coags.

20:44.605 --> 20:47.855
- Dr. Benton?
- I don't care what the computer says.

20:48.025 --> 20:49.485
Is this about Mr. Fletcher?

20:49.778 --> 20:52.982
I'll tell you what.
When they're ready, page me, all right?

20:53.157 --> 20:56.907
Maureen Conway, Financial.
We can't admit Mr. Fletcher.

20:57.079 --> 20:59.998
- Why not? He's got Medicare.
- Which he sold to a bankrupt HMO.

21:00.167 --> 21:01.577
That's not his fault.

21:01.751 --> 21:03.540
But in nine months,
they have not paid claims...

21:03.612 --> 21:07.547
Mr. Fletcher has
run up $200,000 in unrecouped charges.

21:07.717 --> 21:12.381
- He needs a new dialysis shunt.
- Dr. Romano left strict orders.

21:12.557 --> 21:16.057
- Stabilize in the ER and then transfer.
- Wait a minute.

21:16.228 --> 21:18.055
- Do you have an M.D.?
- No.

21:18.231 --> 21:20.853
You're gonna tell me
how to treat my patients?

21:21.026 --> 21:22.983
I've got a pheochromocytoma,

21:23.152 --> 21:25.941
53-year-old male.
How do you suggest I treat him?

21:26.115 --> 21:29.650
Do whatever is necessary.
We won't admit Mr. Fletcher.

21:29.827 --> 21:33.874
Now, if you have any concerns,
take them up with Dr. Romano.

21:34.083 --> 21:38.663
We took Regina to get cleaned up.
Believe it or not, a shower can help.

21:38.839 --> 21:42.754
She did everything right.
She read that damn Expecting book.

21:42.927 --> 21:46.011
It's important that
she knows it's not her fault.

21:46.180 --> 21:50.051
- What happened? Did he die?
- No. You wait here.

21:50.228 --> 21:51.391
Did they find something?

21:51.563 --> 21:55.182
Neonatology examines every preemie.

21:55.359 --> 21:57.318
- They might do something?
- Wait.

21:57.488 --> 22:01.106
Note how the thinness
makes thermal regulation impossible.

22:01.283 --> 22:04.154
- The eyes remain closed-
- What are you doing?

22:04.328 --> 22:06.820
- We heard you had a micro-preemie.
- This isn't show-and-tell.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.829
No, it's a teaching hospital.

22:10.003 --> 22:14.002
As you can see, the heart, limbs
and palate are fully formed.

22:14.175 --> 22:16.845
We might be able to see
the heart beating.

22:17.012 --> 22:19.005
Okay, put him down.

22:19.181 --> 22:21.008
- Excuse me?
- Put him down.

22:21.183 --> 22:22.974
He is not a science experiment.

22:23.143 --> 22:27.011
He isn't. But I need to examine
every birth for congenital anomalies.

22:27.190 --> 22:29.481
- You examined him. Now go.
- When I'm finished.

22:29.778 --> 22:33.906
The father is standing outside thinking
that you are saving his baby.

22:34.367 --> 22:37.118
How long would you like
to torture him?

22:41.333 --> 22:44.003
Are there any questions?

22:45.213 --> 22:47.884
No? Good.

22:48.050 --> 22:51.586
- Transfer him to the fifth floor.
- No.

22:51.763 --> 22:53.092
You can't keep him here.

22:53.265 --> 22:55.508
I'm not sending the parents upstairs
with the mothers.

22:55.685 --> 22:56.764
The NICU then.

22:56.936 --> 23:00.305
He's staying here with his parents
so they can have some privacy.

23:00.482 --> 23:01.941
- In the ER?
- Yes.

23:02.109 --> 23:07.900
- Is there anything you can do?
- No. I'm sorry. He's too young.

23:08.826 --> 23:12.030
Get Mr. Morgan a chair
so he can sit next to his son.

23:12.205 --> 23:13.783
Sure.

23:25.304 --> 23:28.058
I know this is difficult.

23:29.394 --> 23:32.064
Don't be afraid to touch him.

23:32.356 --> 23:37.861
- He's not suffering, is he?
- No.

23:38.071 --> 23:40.988
- We got multiple MVAs coming up.
- Find someplace else.

23:41.157 --> 23:45.662
- This is a Trauma Room.
- I don't care. This room's off-limits.

23:52.386 --> 23:55.140
Titrate the phentolamine to M.A.P. 120.

23:55.308 --> 23:57.265
Mr. Robertson, you are in good hands.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.014
- Dr. Romano.
- Hello, Peter.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.016
I heard you're hoarding the field down here.

24:01.191 --> 24:04.608
An Attending for a week and already
you're stealing the fascinomas, huh?

24:04.780 --> 24:07.189
- You can have him.
- I wasn't asking permission.

24:07.367 --> 24:09.195
We have a problem with a patient.

24:09.370 --> 24:12.705
- Why do you say "we"?
- Financial won't let me admit him.

24:12.875 --> 24:14.865
Don't let those geeks push you around,
Peter.

24:14.937 --> 24:17.710
Show a little backbone, before you come
crying. Otherwise they'll never respect you.

24:17.882 --> 24:19.757
They're blocking him on your orders.

24:19.927 --> 24:22.383
That's different. Let's take a look.

24:22.555 --> 24:26.390
I've cleared him for surgery.
I can have him out in 24 hours.

24:26.562 --> 24:30.692
-28 admissions for renal failure?
- He frequently misses dialysis.

24:30.860 --> 24:34.064
Street him. I am done
carrying these parasites.

24:34.239 --> 24:37.657
- That's an EMT ALA violation.
- No. He's not emergent.

24:37.828 --> 24:40.747
How do you know?
You haven't looked at him.

24:41.083 --> 24:45.414
Okay, Peter. Let's take a look.
Where is he? Curtain Two.

24:45.589 --> 24:46.919
Too late, Lizzie.

24:47.092 --> 24:48.124
- What?
- Nothing.

24:48.302 --> 24:51.258
Have you seen Mark?
He has a patient for me.

24:51.432 --> 24:54.683
- He said something about Radiology.
- I'm Dr. Romano.

24:54.853 --> 24:56.847
- How are you feeling?
- Like crap.

24:57.023 --> 25:00.891
- Can I take a look?
- You're the seventh person to look.

25:01.070 --> 25:02.862
What am I, a freak show?

25:03.031 --> 25:05.987
- Why did you miss your dialysis?
- I was busy.

25:06.161 --> 25:09.117
- Doing what?
- None of your business.

25:09.458 --> 25:12.377
- More important things to do?
- I don't like you.

25:12.546 --> 25:16.379
I didn't like you when you sliced
my foot open and I don't like you now.

25:16.551 --> 25:19.506
I'm hurt, Mr. Fletcher.

25:19.681 --> 25:21.674
What about my pain pill?

25:21.850 --> 25:24.889
- I need my pill!
- The nurse is gonna bring it.

25:25.064 --> 25:27.472
She's too slow. I need a new nurse.

25:27.651 --> 25:31.235
- Put him on a bus to Milwaukee.
- He's fluid-overloaded.

25:31.406 --> 25:34.010
This guy knows exactly
what's gonna happen...

25:34.020 --> 25:36.152
if he misses his dialysis
and he still blows it off.

25:36.330 --> 25:39.202
He's not gonna stop abusing the system
till we draw the line.

25:39.376 --> 25:41.784
- What's this?
- This is for his bus ticket.

25:41.963 --> 25:42.994
You serious?

25:43.173 --> 25:46.046
New state, new Medicaid
and a new set of doctors to piss off.

25:46.220 --> 25:48.676
- He lives in Chicago.
- Cry me a river.

25:50.226 --> 25:51.257
Oh, man...

25:51.436 --> 25:54.641
Please call back immediately.
Thank you. Machine.

25:54.816 --> 25:57.687
- Do you have a pager number?
- No.

25:57.861 --> 26:01.528
- A next-door neighbor? Another relative?
- No.

26:02.953 --> 26:05.243
Well, her breathing has stabilized.

26:05.415 --> 26:09.283
- How long have you been together?
- Twenty-seven years.

26:12.174 --> 26:13.799
Kerry?

26:16.764 --> 26:20.550
- Could you excuse us for a moment?
- Sure.

26:26.070 --> 26:28.110
What are you doing?

26:28.907 --> 26:31.910
She talked to her brother
twice in 10 years.

26:31.979 --> 26:34.535
She didn't grant her partner power of
attorney.

26:34.748 --> 26:36.743
I'm trying to find a legal way
to fulfill her wishes.

26:36.919 --> 26:41.546
-27 years should count for something.
- She has a chance of survival.

26:41.718 --> 26:43.795
But what kind of life?

26:43.971 --> 26:47.258
Intubation is an appropriate step.

26:47.435 --> 26:49.593
The only
one who can change that is the next of kin.

26:49.771 --> 26:53.438
She is the next of kin.
They lived their lives together.

26:53.610 --> 26:57.692
- We should treat them like a couple.
- I agree. The law doesn't.

26:59.076 --> 27:02.114
If her sats drop below 80, tube her.

27:03.041 --> 27:04.120
No.

27:05.002 --> 27:06.081
What?

27:06.462 --> 27:10.378
If you want to manage it this way,
then you should manage it.

27:11.803 --> 27:14.556
Okay. Fine. Give me the chart.

27:28.118 --> 27:31.454
Thank you. I just- I need a picture.

27:32.082 --> 27:33.625
I understand.

27:33.793 --> 27:35.668
- Should we use the name?
- You don't want to?

27:35.838 --> 27:38.460
No, I think we should.

27:38.633 --> 27:41.127
There's only one boy's name
we could agree on.

27:41.305 --> 27:43.797
- What's that?
- Julian.

27:44.350 --> 27:47.139
- It's a nice name.
- Yeah.

27:50.109 --> 27:52.352
How much longer?

27:52.696 --> 27:54.440
I don't know.

27:54.615 --> 27:59.362
It could be a few minutes.
It could be a few hours.

28:04.714 --> 28:08.167
- Let's take him outside.
- What?

28:08.344 --> 28:11.465
We'll take him to a lake or a park.

28:11.974 --> 28:15.475
If he's gonna die,
I don't want him to die in here.

28:16.271 --> 28:18.312
We have to wait for the priest.

28:18.901 --> 28:22.403
- Is he coming?
- I'll check again.

28:23.241 --> 28:24.652
Abby.

28:30.251 --> 28:32.244
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

28:35.341 --> 28:38.927
- I paged you three times.
- We had a 22-week birth here.

28:39.098 --> 28:41.340
You had a patient upstairs
who needed you.

28:41.517 --> 28:44.092
- Did she deliver?
- Yes, she delivered.

28:44.522 --> 28:47.607
- Shoulder dystocia.
- Is the baby okay?

28:48.194 --> 28:51.860
Well, apart from a broken clavicle,
he'll be fine.

28:52.032 --> 28:54.406
She was scared and asking for you.

28:54.578 --> 28:58.792
If you take shifts as a nurse,
I need you to work as a nurse.

28:58.960 --> 29:03.291
You cannot let these women grow
dependent on you and then walk out.

29:03.466 --> 29:06.967
I was taking care
of this woman and her baby.

29:07.138 --> 29:10.639
There are other people down here
who can do that.

29:10.810 --> 29:14.310
Janet, I'm sorry, it was my call.
I asked Abby to stay.

29:14.858 --> 29:18.311
These parents are distraught.
There's nothing we can do...

29:18.488 --> 29:22.903
...but they need support, and Abby's
been with them since the birth.

29:24.330 --> 29:27.866
- Just don't ignore my page.
- I'm sorry.

29:29.086 --> 29:30.250
Thank you.

29:30.422 --> 29:32.996
No. You're doing the hard part.

29:33.176 --> 29:35.503
- Is he still breathing?
- Agonally.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.718
- Let me know when you pronounce.
- Okay.

29:39.018 --> 29:42.970
Last time I got heated blankets
and an extra pillow.

29:43.149 --> 29:45.557
- What's open?
- Depends on what you have.

29:45.736 --> 29:48.063
Revision of an AV graft, left forearm.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.032
- Fletcher?
- How did you know?

29:50.201 --> 29:53.156
Dr. Romano warned me
you'd try to bring him.

29:53.330 --> 29:57.711
- It's my call. Just give me a room.
- I'm sorry, Dr. Benton. I can't.

29:57.880 --> 30:02.010
- I'll be out in less than an hour.
- He actually said he'd fire me.

30:06.057 --> 30:09.558
Okay. Okay, well, please hurry.

30:09.729 --> 30:11.473
Thank you.

30:13.235 --> 30:14.813
The priest talked...

30:14.987 --> 30:18.405
that woman down.
He's gonna baptize this baby.

30:18.910 --> 30:20.654
- How long has it been?
- Five hours.

30:20.829 --> 30:24.580
He's really hanging on.

30:25.461 --> 30:27.917
Maybe the mother is right.
Maybe he is a miracle.

30:28.089 --> 30:32.136
In 10, 15 years
we might be able to help.

30:32.637 --> 30:35.807
They wanted to try.
We could intubate him.

30:35.977 --> 30:37.769
- Abby...
- I know.

30:39.440 --> 30:44.685
It's his time on Earth, and all
you can do is make it a good time.

30:47.201 --> 30:49.740
I think he stopped breathing.

30:49.955 --> 30:51.865
Here we go.

30:54.963 --> 30:57.502
- That's not a respirator?
- No.

30:57.675 --> 31:00.547
It provides pressure to her lungs so...

31:00.721 --> 31:03.213
she doesn't have to work so hard to breathe.

31:05.103 --> 31:08.140
Her father died of lung cancer.

31:10.443 --> 31:14.775
I remember Glenda and her brother
fighting outside the ICU.

31:15.492 --> 31:18.910
Danny couldn't let go, and Glenda
couldn't watch her father suffer like that.

31:19.081 --> 31:21.490
You know, all those tubes.

31:23.504 --> 31:28.667
After her first stroke, Glenda made me
promise to never let her die like that.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.592
We'll do everything we can
to reach her brother.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.845
He doesn't know her like I do.

31:39.945 --> 31:42.188
I love her.

31:45.035 --> 31:49.284
I don't want to lose her,
but I know what she wants.

31:54.550 --> 31:58.384
His breathing just slowed down
and then it just stopped.

31:58.556 --> 32:01.723
Please, if you could do anything...

32:03.730 --> 32:06.019
Is there a heartbeat?

32:06.233 --> 32:07.811
No.

32:14.079 --> 32:16.535
- You want to call it?
- Oh, God.

32:21.047 --> 32:23.253
- Abby?
- Yeah.

32:23.425 --> 32:24.588
Is that it?

32:29.768 --> 32:31.927
The time of death is-

32:32.105 --> 32:34.561
Wait! His chest moved.

32:35.235 --> 32:37.441
Is he still alive?

32:48.086 --> 32:49.746
Got a heartbeat.

33:00.854 --> 33:04.059
Yes, but your sister
has an aspiration pneumonia.

33:04.234 --> 33:08.530
If we put her on a ventilator,
she may never come off it.

33:09.116 --> 33:12.203
Perhaps. She suffered a massive stroke...

33:12.372 --> 33:14.199
from which she probably will not recover.

33:14.375 --> 33:18.125
Mr. Walton, I cannot
give you percentages.

33:18.297 --> 33:21.133
Extremely unlikely.

33:22.929 --> 33:27.509
Your sister's wishes are not
to be kept alive by artificial means.

33:27.686 --> 33:30.772
Judy. Would you like to talk to her?

33:34.738 --> 33:38.868
Yes, if we don't intubate her,
she will die, but the chances of-

33:39.036 --> 33:44.329
The chances of a meaningful recovery
are extremely-

33:45.086 --> 33:47.458
I understand.

33:49.384 --> 33:51.544
Yes. Goodbye.

33:57.062 --> 33:59.020
- Hey, you. Malatucci.
- Malucci.

33:59.190 --> 34:02.690
Whatever. Have you seen
the OIG officer down here?

34:02.861 --> 34:03.893
Who?

34:04.071 --> 34:08.534
Deputy inspector general.
Regulates our Medicare compliance.

34:08.703 --> 34:10.781
- Short, battle-ax, humorless?
- That's her.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.666
- Curtain Two.
- Thank you.

34:12.835 --> 34:15.292
Benton told you you needed surgery?

34:15.464 --> 34:16.496
He brought me upstairs.

34:16.674 --> 34:20.092
- Why didn't he operate?
- Nurse wouldn't let him in.

34:20.263 --> 34:23.679
He tried to tell me
they didn't have a room ready.

34:23.850 --> 34:26.770
Mr. Fletcher, we're ready for you.
Sandy.

34:26.938 --> 34:29.431
- Hello, Robert.
- What an unexpected visit.

34:29.609 --> 34:32.315
I'm investigating a possible
EMT ALA violation.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.648
- What patient?
- Mr. Fletcher.

34:37.580 --> 34:39.074
Some sort of spot audit?

34:39.248 --> 34:41.326
We got a call you were bouncing him.

34:41.502 --> 34:43.329
- From whom?
- Anonymous.

34:43.838 --> 34:46.127
Anonymous does not equal reliable.

34:46.299 --> 34:49.588
I was just coming to take
Mr. Fletcher to surgery.

34:49.764 --> 34:52.257
Is that true, Dr. Benton?

34:53.018 --> 34:55.178
I'm sure Dr. Romano's found a room.

34:55.355 --> 34:58.192
This is a consent form.
I'll explain it.

34:58.360 --> 34:59.558
I know the drill.

34:59.737 --> 35:02.823
Tell me you don't have policy to redirect...

35:02.992 --> 35:05.281
all non-paying Medicare HMO patients.

35:05.453 --> 35:08.291
- How could we? We're a county hospital.
- Good.

35:08.459 --> 35:10.582
- Always a pleasure.
- I'm sure.

35:10.753 --> 35:13.424
I think you should know
that I will be auditing...

35:13.591 --> 35:15.999
all of your patient transfers
from the last month.

35:16.177 --> 35:21.091
- Audit away. No skeletons here.
- I hope so.

35:23.855 --> 35:27.985
- Dr. Romano, I felt I had to-
- Not a word, Peter. Not a single word.

35:28.153 --> 35:30.112
You're not gonna leave a scar, are you?

35:30.282 --> 35:32.608
The hack that first put this in left a-

35:32.785 --> 35:34.411
Shut up.

35:34.580 --> 35:36.787
I'd have had better exposure
and direct visualisation...

35:36.958 --> 35:40.079
without beaming
a gigavolt of radiation into the man.

35:40.254 --> 35:42.793
- A gigavolt?
- You know what I mean.

35:42.966 --> 35:46.420
I could have completely evacuated
all the infected tissue.

35:46.597 --> 35:49.433
- These guys are going in half-blind.
- Fine. Whatever.

35:49.602 --> 35:53.766
Next spinal abscess
is all yours, I promise.

35:54.108 --> 35:57.774
- Where is this place, anyway?
- You'll see.

35:57.947 --> 35:59.940
These are houses, Mark.

36:05.792 --> 36:07.287
Oh, Mark!

36:08.170 --> 36:10.496
It's beautiful!

36:10.674 --> 36:13.711
See, I have some taste.

36:14.137 --> 36:15.845
Can you afford it?

36:16.015 --> 36:20.144
I've been living cheap.
Besides, I'm gonna have a roommate.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.520
That's awfully presumptuous of you.

36:22.691 --> 36:24.351
I could take out an ad.

36:24.527 --> 36:27.945
You will not! I love it!

36:28.116 --> 36:30.952
Check out the refrigerator.
It's nice and cold.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.328
Look at this deck!

36:33.499 --> 36:35.041
I knew you'd love that.

36:35.209 --> 36:38.497
- When can we move in?
- When can you pack?

36:38.673 --> 36:42.293
- It has an icemaker.
- These floors are gorgeous!

36:42.470 --> 36:44.179
- Check it out.
- What?

36:44.347 --> 36:47.516
- The icemaker.
- It's lovely.

36:47.687 --> 36:52.184
You have to open it.
It has a special ice feature.

36:52.359 --> 36:56.608
What? Does the ice come in
different-shaped cubes or something?

37:02.165 --> 37:05.085
Oh, my God. Mark...

37:15.227 --> 37:18.264
I'm a little nervous. So...

37:18.731 --> 37:21.223
Let me say it.

37:21.819 --> 37:24.906
Elizabeth, I love you.

37:26.535 --> 37:30.472
I was hoping you'd give me the joy
and honor...

37:30.507 --> 37:32.825
of being your husband.

37:41.848 --> 37:43.510
Is that a yes?

37:49.777 --> 37:51.438
Yes.

38:23.452 --> 38:29.041
Do you believe in God, the Father
Almighty, creator of heaven and Earth?

38:29.210 --> 38:30.585
I do.

38:30.753 --> 38:36.177
Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his son,
who was born of the Virgin Mary...

38:36.344 --> 38:39.549
...suffered and died, but rose...

38:39.725 --> 38:42.513
and now sits at the Father's right hand?

38:42.688 --> 38:44.017
I do.

38:44.190 --> 38:49.020
Do you believe in the Holy Spirit,
the Lord, the giver of life...?

39:00.046 --> 39:04.295
Regina and Joseph, is it your will
that Julian should be baptized...

39:04.469 --> 39:08.255
...in the faith of the church
which we have professed?

39:08.433 --> 39:09.845
Yes.

39:18.740 --> 39:20.115
I'm sorry.

39:26.335 --> 39:29.420
I baptize you in the name
of the Father...

39:29.589 --> 39:33.803
...and the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

39:34.179 --> 39:35.638
Amen.

39:51.956 --> 39:55.622
Hi. Could I get a coffee with cream,
no sugar, to go?

39:55.794 --> 39:57.206
Sure.

39:58.548 --> 39:59.878
Hey.

40:01.136 --> 40:03.807
Hi. You back already?

40:04.975 --> 40:07.015
No, not for another week.

40:09.648 --> 40:14.727
- What, are you just hanging out?
- I have a diversion meeting at 9.

40:16.449 --> 40:18.526
You look much better.

40:18.704 --> 40:20.115
Thank you.

40:20.289 --> 40:23.826
- Hey, I like your hair.
- Thank you.

40:25.296 --> 40:28.666
Some nice scrubs.
You picking up some extra shifts?

40:28.843 --> 40:31.548
No. I was suspended.

40:34.184 --> 40:36.473
- Didn't kill anybody, did you?
- No.

40:36.645 --> 40:38.935
I wanted to.

40:39.401 --> 40:45.073
My ex-husband was supposed to pay
my tuition. He didn't pay it, so...

40:45.242 --> 40:46.986
I'm on the bench,

40:47.161 --> 40:49.534
but it didn't
seem like that today. Thank you.

40:49.706 --> 40:51.581
- Hey, I got that.
- It's okay.

40:51.751 --> 40:54.077
Hey, it's a cup of coffee.

40:54.254 --> 40:55.370
Sit down.

40:55.715 --> 40:58.884
It's the least I can do
after acting like a complete jerk.

41:01.558 --> 41:03.017
When?

41:03.310 --> 41:04.888
Three months ago.

41:05.604 --> 41:08.393
You know, you might
have saved my life.

41:08.567 --> 41:13.148
If you hadn't stopped me when you did,
I could be dead now.

41:18.249 --> 41:20.787
I'm working on my steps here.

41:21.754 --> 41:24.246
You're up to nine already?

41:25.008 --> 41:27.132
More or less.

41:27.971 --> 41:30.178
I forgive you.

41:30.808 --> 41:32.089
Do you mind?

41:32.269 --> 41:33.597
Sorry.

41:33.771 --> 41:37.356
I really have to quit again.
Thank you.

41:37.736 --> 41:41.152
Keep it. Long day?

41:42.618 --> 41:43.946
Yeah.

41:44.120 --> 41:46.243
22-week-old preemie survived...

41:46.414 --> 41:48.159
nine hours. I just finished the death kit.

41:49.252 --> 41:51.494
- Wow.
- Yeah.

41:51.797 --> 41:55.713
I don't know why I do this.
I should go be an accountant.

41:55.887 --> 41:59.092
- That's an option.
- If I could balance a checkbook.

41:59.267 --> 42:00.726
What about you?

42:00.894 --> 42:03.468
A lot of waiting. A lot of meetings.

42:05.943 --> 42:09.064
Yeah. You get kind of meeting-ed out.

42:12.827 --> 42:14.489
Aren't you gonna ask?

42:14.664 --> 42:16.076
What?

42:16.250 --> 42:18.920
What I was doing there this morning?

42:19.170 --> 42:21.129
You only go for one reason.

42:21.299 --> 42:25.548
I figured I'd keep going and eventually
you'd stand up and share.

42:27.432 --> 42:29.307
It's not that interesting.

42:30.687 --> 42:32.645
I'm a drunk.

42:32.857 --> 42:35.350
- How long have you been sober?
- Five years.

42:38.199 --> 42:41.367
- So you could sponsor somebody.
- Yeah, I guess.

42:41.537 --> 42:42.866
- Have you?
- No.

42:45.083 --> 42:49.379
Because I'm supposed to find a sponsor.

42:54.389 --> 42:56.716
- Don't look at me.
- No?

42:57.727 --> 43:01.976
No, I'm barely holding my own life
together right now. Trust me.

43:02.150 --> 43:07.609
Because it would be great
to have somebody at the hospital.

43:07.783 --> 43:10.073
You did start me on my recovery.

43:10.245 --> 43:12.737
Men and women aren't supposed
to sponsor each other.

43:12.916 --> 43:15.408
- Don't worry about it.
- Thanks.

43:15.586 --> 43:17.497
Come on.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.593
You're not gonna make me
ask a stranger, are you?

43:20.760 --> 43:25.508
I mean, the only person I met at
the meeting was the coffee guy.

43:30.942 --> 43:33.779
Okay. Okay.

43:33.947 --> 43:38.242
I will work the steps with you
until you find a permanent sponsor.

43:38.411 --> 43:39.823
Fair enough.

43:41.290 --> 43:43.961
I'll start by setting a good example.

43:44.879 --> 43:47.797
I don't think cigarettes
are gonna do it for me tonight.

43:47.966 --> 43:49.628
- No?
- No.

43:49.803 --> 43:52.841
I'm getting a hot fudge sundae.

43:54.017 --> 43:56.391
- Would you like one?
- I got enough vices.

43:56.647 --> 44:01.726
No. I think part of the rules should be
that you have to splurge with me.

44:02.196 --> 44:04.604
Is that how it works?

45:02.397 --> 45:04.474
