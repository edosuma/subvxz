00:02.030 --> 00:03.497
TERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:03.530 --> 00:05.691
MAN: (speaking Spanish)

00:07.440 --> 00:09.135
-Are you working for Camila?
-No.

00:09.170 --> 00:10.330
JAMES: Since
the first day we met,

00:10.370 --> 00:12.008
I've been trying
to keep you alive.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.235
Whether you wanna believe it
or not, I'm still trying to.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.736
But you have
to trust me.

00:15.780 --> 00:17.839
You want me to trust you?
I don't even know you.

00:17.880 --> 00:19.142
Why did you come back?

00:19.180 --> 00:20.545
I wanna do things differently.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.343
So I'm asking you.
Please let me in.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.245
No more cat and mouse, General.
I want blood.

00:25.290 --> 00:26.484
When will she get
what's coming to her?

00:26.520 --> 00:27.919
Today.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.427
Do you think she's trying
to move against me?

00:29.460 --> 00:31.485
That's why we need
to make our own moves.

00:31.530 --> 00:32.827
When the heroin business
IS up and running,

00:32.860 --> 00:34.657
we won't need her or Reynaldo.

00:34.700 --> 00:37.260
Took us six months to build
what we have here in Malta.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.894
You burn Rocco,
and you burn it all.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.261
I knew we were
gonna rob a bank.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.436
(gunshots)

00:43.470 --> 00:44.698
(grunts)

00:44.740 --> 00:45.832
(panﬁng)

00:45.870 --> 00:47.906
(yells)

00:47.940 --> 00:49.669
Whoo!

00:49.710 --> 00:53.339
If I ever see you again,
you're gonna be screaming.

00:53.380 --> 00:56.110
(tense music)

01:16.000 --> 01:17.467
(water turns off)

01:22.650 --> 01:24.049
(bell dings)

01:24.080 --> 01:27.072
(country music playing)

01:30.820 --> 01:32.287
You all right?

01:34.160 --> 01:36.128
Yeah.
It's been a long trip.

01:37.490 --> 01:38.821
How far is your place?

01:38.860 --> 01:40.498
Not far. It's just up the road.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.067
(tires rustling on pavement)

01:44.100 --> 01:45.727
POTE: I smell pork.

01:45.770 --> 01:47.135
JAMES: My money's
on the sausage.

01:47.170 --> 01:50.435
Not there, cabrn.
There.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.177
JAMES: Easy.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.644
We should go.
Excuse me.

01:58.680 --> 01:59.942
Check, please.

02:03.650 --> 02:05.982
That's County Sheriff Jed Mayo.

02:06.020 --> 02:08.488
Harassing illegals
is his favorite hobby.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.987
I'll_ show him
my pinche papers.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.679
JAMES: Don't call attention.

02:11.730 --> 02:15.757
The good news is he's for sale.
Worst case.

02:15.800 --> 02:16.869
(police radio chatter)

02:16.900 --> 02:18.492
OWNER: What the hell is this?

02:18.530 --> 02:21.033
I already paid you
sons of bitches this month.

02:21.070 --> 02:22.901
This ain't the place
for that kind of tone.

02:24.140 --> 02:26.199
Here, boy.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.673
Hey!

02:27.710 --> 02:29.678
Mm.

02:29.710 --> 02:32.679
(ominous music)

02:32.720 --> 02:38.841
*

02:38.890 --> 02:40.858
MAN: Please, please.
No, no.

02:40.890 --> 02:42.187
(engine turns over)

02:42.230 --> 02:45.449
(both speaking indistinctly)

02:45.490 --> 02:48.220
(speaking Spanish)

02:48.260 --> 02:50.899
POTE: I don't know
about this place.

02:50.930 --> 02:55.663
*

02:55.700 --> 02:58.362
TERESA: There's dirty cops
everywhere.

02:58.410 --> 03:00.878
I have to stop running
at some point.

03:02.710 --> 03:04.302
We'll make it work.

03:04.350 --> 03:11.347
*

03:19.600 --> 03:26.597
*

03:29.970 --> 03:32.507
We've got just that
one access road coming in.

03:32.540 --> 03:36.943
These pole cams set up to alert
us to any uninvited guests.

03:36.980 --> 03:40.768
And that perimeter fence.
Be careful. It's electrified.

03:43.820 --> 03:45.242
You gotta be kidding me.

03:45.290 --> 03:46.951
Qu pas, Pote?

03:46.990 --> 03:49.254
JAMES: Charger and Tonto,
they work for us now.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.392
I know some local players.
They've got good distribution.

03:56.430 --> 03:58.193
But not consistent product.

03:58.230 --> 04:00.369
I've been working on
something since Malta.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.539
We're gonna sell
on the dark web.

04:02.570 --> 04:03.969
I have a guy.
His name is Ivan.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.637
He's built me a site.

04:05.670 --> 04:08.138
Didn't work out so well
for the Silk Road guys.

04:08.180 --> 04:12.105
Rocco was insane.
But cryptocurrency makes sense.

04:12.150 --> 04:14.539
It's safer.
Less l'lSk.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.070
And less profit.

04:17.790 --> 04:21.248
What kind of volume
can we move that way?

04:21.290 --> 04:23.827
We're gonna connect with
a thousand mid-level dealers.

04:23.860 --> 04:27.421
People who can handle,
I don't know, a kilo a month.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.121
We're never gonna
have to meet them.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.720
We're gonna ship
through a legitimate front.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.635
And get paid
with cryptocurrency.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.236
Mail-order cocaine?

04:36.270 --> 04:39.103
You said you wanted a better
way of doing business.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.240
Arizona's carved up
by five narcos.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.339
JAMES: Nothing comes in and
out without their say-so.

04:46.380 --> 04:48.268
They're called "La Comisin."

04:48.320 --> 04:51.414
But the power between
the five isn't an even split.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.850
There's Taza.
His tribe controls the border.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.517
So everything
goes through him.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.357
And Pecas,
he brings in the most product.

04:57.390 --> 04:58.584
He's the boss.

04:58.630 --> 05:00.097
We're gonna ship
out of state.

05:00.130 --> 05:02.121
We won't be cutting
into anyone's territory.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.321
No, but we still need
to transport through it.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.691
JAMES: They cut a deal with
that corrupt Sheriff Mayo.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.163
He makes sure no one else's
product can get through.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.202
And they pay him
a pretty penny for it.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.543
About seven miles out that way
is a mass grave.

05:16.580 --> 05:18.343
It's filled
with the bodies of dealers

05:18.380 --> 05:19.779
who thought just
what you're thinking now.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.515
Set up business here.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.279
And don't give
La Comisin a taste.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.015
(indistinct shouting)

05:25.050 --> 05:27.154
JAMES:
The graveyard of ambition.

05:27.190 --> 05:28.953
Trust me.

05:28.990 --> 05:31.857
We wanna break into this
market, it's gonna cost blood.

05:31.890 --> 05:34.859
(tense music)

05:34.900 --> 05:37.926
(chimes clinking)

05:42.510 --> 05:46.037
CAMILA: (speaking Spanish)

05:56.950 --> 05:59.953
(ominous music)

06:04.290 --> 06:06.178
CAMILA: Mucho gusto.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.769
(speaking Spanish)

06:10.800 --> 06:15.737
*

06:32.490 --> 06:33.957
Muerte.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.091
(dramatic musical sting)

06:40.130 --> 06:41.722
Teresa.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.399
EPIFANIO: (grunts)

06:44.430 --> 06:49.936

06:49.970 --> 06:52.029
(gunshot)
(gasps)

06:52.070 --> 06:54.129
(breathing heavily)

07:02.490 --> 07:04.048
(line trilling)

07:04.090 --> 07:06.979
LOYA (over phone): Camila.
-I need you to come.

07:07.020 --> 07:08.453
Right away.

07:10.190 --> 07:12.658
REPORTER: This roadblock
you see behind me,

07:12.700 --> 07:14.793
is intended to put
a stranglehold on smuggling

07:14.830 --> 07:16.468
along the I-10 corridor.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.094
It's an operation being
spearheaded by a man

07:19.130 --> 07:22.065
with a deplorable record
of civil rights abuses.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.830
Sheriff Mayo, what is your
response to those who say

07:24.870 --> 07:27.100
that you are unfairly
targeting Mexicans

07:27.140 --> 07:28.903
-during these sweeps?
-You call it profiling.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.805
Icall it _ _
common sense pollcmg.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.647
And I'm doing the job that
the voters of this county

07:32.680 --> 07:34.147
elected me to do.

07:34.180 --> 07:37.308
REPORTER: Sam Espinoza,
Action 12 News.

07:37.350 --> 07:40.456
(foreboding music)

07:45.060 --> 07:47.927
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:47.960 --> 07:51.828
If La Comisin has
the Sheriff in their pocket,

07:51.870 --> 07:55.863
why is he setting up
roadblocks on their routes?

07:55.900 --> 07:58.960
Maybe he just wants
a bigger piece of the action.

07:59.010 --> 08:01.376
Like I said,
he's just in it for himself.

08:01.410 --> 08:03.674
Can you get us a meeting?

08:03.710 --> 08:06.770
JAMES: With La Comisin?
You sure about that?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.845
TERESA: Yes.
-Yeah, I know some people.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.313
I can make a call.

08:12.590 --> 08:14.478
Thank you.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.714
Yeah.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.548
*

08:19.600 --> 08:21.022
I don't know what
you want me to tell you.

08:21.060 --> 08:22.220
Really?

08:22.260 --> 08:24.069
It's not like she's on her own.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.466
-Yeah, I know that.
-I've got nothing for you.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.196
The DEA lost sight of Mendoza
when she got burned in Malta.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.504
Then you need to work
your sources harder.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.371
I want her found.
Do you understand?

08:33.410 --> 08:35.628
Just how much access
do you think I have?

08:35.680 --> 08:37.375
I'm still on suspension.

08:37.410 --> 08:39.241
And I just gave you one of
Boaz Jimenez's shipments.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.214
400 kilos for you to look good.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.945
You think that comes for free?

08:44.250 --> 08:46.411
-Do you?
-Camila, calm down.

08:46.450 --> 08:47.986
Don't tell me to calm down.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.829
You know, that woman
took everything from me.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.054
Shit.

08:51.090 --> 08:53.320
-It's nothing.
-It's something.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.725
Come.

08:56.430 --> 08:58.421
It's a small cut.
Hold it here.

08:58.470 --> 09:00.290
It's not as bad as it looks.

09:02.100 --> 09:05.706
Sometimes I wish
I had a different life.

09:05.740 --> 09:09.232
*

09:09.280 --> 09:11.168
Sometimes we all do.

09:11.210 --> 09:17.183
*

09:17.220 --> 09:19.609
This is not a good idea.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.015
I don't care.

09:22.060 --> 09:29.057
*

09:30.830 --> 09:32.468
(moaning)

09:32.500 --> 09:34.968
(panﬁng)

09:35.000 --> 09:42.008
*

09:43.450 --> 09:45.907
POTE: We're buying a winery?

09:45.950 --> 09:48.646
TERESA: We can't operate
from James' compound.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.147
We need a base.

09:58.290 --> 10:01.350
WOMAN: [indistinct speech]

10:03.870 --> 10:05.963
POTE: Is that
who I think it is?

10:07.300 --> 10:09.837
Oh, it's so good
to see you, girl.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.269
Yeah, that's her.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.504
Good to see you,
Kelly Anne.

10:12.540 --> 10:15.907
You look great.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.771
POTE: The red hair
don't fool me.

10:17.810 --> 10:20.074
KELLY: So the realtor said I
could give you the grand tour.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.815
This is the main room,
obviously.

10:21.850 --> 10:23.989
There's a wine tasting bar
over there.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.317
How soon can we close the deal?

10:25.350 --> 10:26.658
Uh, pretty damn quick.

10:26.690 --> 10:28.180
The owner's desperate
to unload.

10:28.220 --> 10:30.029
And I've already got a straw
corporation set up

10:30.060 --> 10:31.618
to be the owner of record.

10:31.660 --> 10:33.594
The police looking for you?

10:33.630 --> 10:36.155
Officially,
I'm a missing person.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.667
KELLY: And it's Priscilla now.
By the way,

10:37.700 --> 10:39.622
those papers you gave me
worked like a charm.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.797
Wow, that's a heaw door.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.467
Okay, here we go.
Isn't this cool?

10:43.510 --> 10:45.432
It's like our very own
little Batgirl cave.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.870
(electronic music)

10:47.910 --> 10:50.140
We can put our
production down here.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.148
Oh, guys.
Those stairs there,

10:52.180 --> 10:54.216
kind of takes the wind out
of you a little bit.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.979
Okay, so these big silver
things, uh, uh,

10:56.020 --> 10:57.339
I think they're vats.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.483
That's where_
they make the wme.

11:01.890 --> 11:03.380
KELLY: Yep, over here
there's a tunnel that leads

11:03.430 --> 11:04.727
off the property here.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.490
So...
(grunts)

11:07.530 --> 11:10.328
KELLY: You know, for security.
-If you say so.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.989
TERESA: Thank you, Kelly Anne.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.838
Are you kidding? God knows
where I'd be without you.

11:17.870 --> 11:21.704
-How's Tony?
-Oh, good. Yeah.

11:21.740 --> 11:24.971
He loves his new school.
Oh, he made the soccer team.

11:25.010 --> 11:26.739
He's getting good grades.

11:26.780 --> 11:29.214
TERESA: He's big.
KELLY: Yeah, I know.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.241
Everything's taken care of
with the money you gave me.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.611
But, you know,
he asks about you.

11:35.220 --> 11:37.882
It's too dangerous
for him to see me.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.227
It's better this way.

11:40.930 --> 11:42.352
I understand.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.028
Okay, well,
what do you guys think?

11:45.070 --> 11:46.560
Is this our new home?

11:46.600 --> 11:48.534
-Let's make an offer.
-Oh, deal.

11:48.570 --> 11:50.367
Bring it in for a hug, girl.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.002
You want a hug too?
(cell phone vibrating)

11:52.040 --> 11:54.406
Nope? No. He's not--(giggles)
He doesn't hug.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.238
*

11:57.280 --> 11:59.373
-Yeah.
JAMES (over phone): It's on.

11:59.410 --> 12:01.571
We meet with La Comisin
In two hours.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.588
I'm ready.

12:03.620 --> 12:06.509
*

12:06.550 --> 12:08.450
I just got word the DEA seized

12:08.490 --> 12:10.424
another_one of
Boaz's shipments.

12:10.460 --> 12:12.849
300 kilos of cocaine.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.424
And a surprise,

12:14.460 --> 12:18.191
100 kilos of
Mexican brown heroin.

12:18.230 --> 12:20.061
Colombians will not be pleased.

12:20.100 --> 12:23.206
Another seizure,
and Boaz is bringing in herona

12:23.240 --> 12:25.538
behind their back.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.629
No way they're gonna
stand for this.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.138
CORTEZ: You will be hearing
from Reynaldo soon, I'm sure.

12:31.180 --> 12:35.116
Not even that niece of his
will defend Boaz on this one.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.084
*

12:37.120 --> 12:39.418
Mom, you wanted to see me?

12:39.450 --> 12:42.510
Yes.
Excuse me, General.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.588
Is everything okay?

12:48.130 --> 12:50.325
It's about the Widows' March.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.339
I don't want you to come,
Isabela.

12:54.370 --> 12:55.837
It's not safe.

12:56.670 --> 12:59.559
You know, it's a protest
against the cartels.

12:59.610 --> 13:01.339
And there's been threats.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.075
We're honoring
Papi's memory.

13:03.110 --> 13:04.668
How could I not be there?

13:04.710 --> 13:07.349
Your father would insist
upon your safety above all.

13:07.380 --> 13:08.813
You know that.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.488
What aren't you telling me?

13:15.660 --> 13:18.788
You know,

13:18.830 --> 13:21.151
I told you that

13:21.200 --> 13:24.089
my nana believed in omens.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.961
And she was always right.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.835
I had a nightmare.

13:29.870 --> 13:32.168
I'm not gonna let you
do this by yourself.

13:32.210 --> 13:35.373
I already lost Papi.
I'm not gonna lose you too.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.808
(tense music)

13:44.850 --> 13:49.014
JAMES: We're meeting
at a casino owned by Taza.

13:49.060 --> 13:51.051
His tribe put all
their assets into it.

13:51.090 --> 13:55.026
When it failed, that's when
Taza turned to selling drugs.

13:55.060 --> 13:57.164
They meet on Taza's territory,

13:57.200 --> 13:59.225
but it's Pecas
who calls the shots.

13:59.270 --> 14:01.397
He's the redhead
with the temper to match.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.000
We don't wanna cross him.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.008
*

14:06.040 --> 14:07.405
TERESA: And the others?

14:09.010 --> 14:10.648
JAMES: They carry
their weight.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.671
But it's Pecas and_Taza
we need to convmce.

14:12.710 --> 14:14.075
If they like us, we live.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.418
They don't, we disappear.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.915
PECAS: That's the business
you should've learned.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.188
Ooh.

14:26.060 --> 14:28.551
Because you have bigger balls
than any man I've ever met,

14:28.600 --> 14:30.818
to come and sit at our table
with a $10 million bounty

14:30.870 --> 14:34.033
on your head.
(chuckles)

14:34.070 --> 14:36.197
Saludos, chica.

14:38.070 --> 14:39.901
10 million is a finite number.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.948
I'm here because I'm confident

14:43.980 --> 14:46.847
I can make you more than that.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.677
JAMES: Thank you
for meeting us.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.449
We know you're busy men,
so we'll be brief.

14:50.490 --> 14:54.187
"We"?
(shushes)

14:54.220 --> 14:55.881
PECAS: Go ahead, Miss Mendoza.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.583
I've come to ask for
safe passage for my product.

14:59.630 --> 15:03.122
Each one of you kicks in
8% of your profit.

15:03.170 --> 15:06.867
You share risks and provide
each other with protection.

15:06.900 --> 15:10.267
What I'm offering
is an extra contribution.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.029
You have a lot of_enemies
back In Mexrco.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.378
PECAS: We would not want
those enemies to become ours.

15:15.410 --> 15:19.449
Perhaps you'd be better off
taking your business

15:19.480 --> 15:22.244
out of Arizona,
while you still can.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.049
What if I brought something
else to the table?

15:26.090 --> 15:28.308
Oh, I'm sure we could
think of something.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.954
(chuckling)

15:30.990 --> 15:32.685
Sheriff Mayo.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.126
What do you know about Mayo?

15:37.170 --> 15:39.593
He's setting up roadblocks
on your routes

15:39.630 --> 15:41.598
to get more money out of you.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.335
What ifI could do
something about him?

15:44.270 --> 15:46.830
Perhaps we're getting a little
ahead of ourselves here.

15:48.310 --> 15:50.278
If Hangman Jed were
to disappear tomorrow,

15:50.310 --> 15:51.948
our days would be much lighter.

15:51.980 --> 15:54.744
That said, with him,
we know what we've got.

15:54.780 --> 15:57.908
Mm, but lately
he's become unreasonable.

15:57.950 --> 16:00.009
Greedy.
Cutting into our profits.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.755
PECAS: This isn't Mexico.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.826
You know the kind of heat
something like that would draw?

16:03.860 --> 16:06.920
You all have a deal with Mayo.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.723
You can't move against him.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.619
But I can.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.537
Let me help you.

16:19.910 --> 16:22.936
Okay.
Mera mera, we'll play.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.709
PECAS: You get the Sheriff
to stand down,

16:24.750 --> 16:26.570
you can write your own ticket.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.310
Consider it done.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.380
Thank you.

16:35.220 --> 16:42.228
*

16:50.000 --> 16:52.639
CASTEL: My uncle put me in
a plane as soon as we got word

16:52.670 --> 16:54.228
of the load getting seized.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.805
I'm as appalled as you are
about what Boaz did.

16:58.710 --> 17:00.974
He has agreed
to make restitution to us.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.648
He moved heroin
behind our back.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.682
It's a matter of trust,
not finance.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.655
Our primary concern right now
is that he shore up the leaks

17:09.690 --> 17:11.419
in his operation.

17:11.460 --> 17:14.054
CASTEL: It's clear he has
una rata in his house.

17:16.060 --> 17:17.129
It's lunacy.

17:18.230 --> 17:20.664
We've reached
an accommodation wnth Boaz,

17:20.700 --> 17:23.965
so there's no need for you to
concern yourself any further.

17:24.770 --> 17:25.862
Are we clear?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.233
Thank you, Castel.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.345
General.

17:32.380 --> 17:35.110
(ominous music)

17:35.150 --> 17:40.952
*

17:40.990 --> 17:44.084
They're still backing
that hijo de puta.

17:44.130 --> 17:47.952
Yes, Boaz cut them in
on the heroin.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.889
While they're making money
with him, we cannot touch him.

17:50.930 --> 17:52.864
Not without losing
our supplier.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.936
Well, tonight's march
is about Epifanio.

17:54.970 --> 17:57.461
We're gonna get
his business back.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.762
And the Colombians
are gonna turn on Boaz.

17:59.810 --> 18:03.644
If heroin wasn't enough,
then we'll do more.

18:06.610 --> 18:08.441
IVAN (over tablet):
It's pretty heinous stuff,

18:08.480 --> 18:09.879
and you can't un-see it.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.740
When are you
arriving in Phoenix?

18:11.790 --> 18:14.884
Tomorrow, I've got a laptop
with your sales system set up,

18:14.920 --> 18:16.319
and I'll secure your location.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.282
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.786
-Great.
-Bye.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.228
James.
Look at this.

18:28.270 --> 18:32.331
I sent Ivan looking for
something to use against Mayo.

18:32.370 --> 18:33.598
MAYO: (grunts)
(thud)

18:33.640 --> 18:36.575
MAN: (crying)

18:36.610 --> 18:40.444
MAYO: Quit whining.
Stay awake.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.970
MAN: (screams in pain)

18:42.020 --> 18:44.614
MAYO: Little bitch.

18:44.650 --> 18:46.618
Maybe we should just kill him.

18:46.650 --> 18:48.789
TERESA: I had Ivan leak
the video to this reporter.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.629
JAMES: Sam Espinoza.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.878
He's been after Mayo
for years now.

18:54.330 --> 18:55.820
Now he's got him.

19:01.900 --> 19:04.869
(bilingual hip-hop music)

19:04.910 --> 19:08.869
*

19:08.910 --> 19:10.070
Mmm.

19:11.910 --> 19:18.918
*

19:21.490 --> 19:25.278
General.
Qu pasa? Qu pedo?

19:25.330 --> 19:27.298
You seem to be in high spirits
for a man

19:27.330 --> 19:29.195
who just lost 400 kilos.

19:29.230 --> 19:31.562
I'm trying to...

19:31.600 --> 19:33.693
take it in stride.
(sniffs)

19:33.740 --> 19:35.037
CORTEZ: Is that what
I think it is?

19:35.070 --> 19:37.959
The Colombians wanted me
to find the rata.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.500
I found the rata.

19:39.540 --> 19:42.907
Cochi's got some great skills
with the knife, no?

19:44.210 --> 19:46.872
Hah, who's laughing now,
pendejo?

19:46.910 --> 19:48.844
(laughs)

19:48.880 --> 19:50.984
I hate to tell you this, compa,

19:51.020 --> 19:53.853
but I can say
with all certainty,

19:53.890 --> 19:56.916
you decapitated
an innocent man.

19:59.190 --> 20:01.727
CORTEZ: There's your rata
right there.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.524
Camila's been talking to
the DEA agent that set her up?

20:04.570 --> 20:06.265
Is this even real?

20:06.300 --> 20:07.892
I'm afraid so.

20:11.440 --> 20:14.830
Camila is playing you.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.734
She wants the business back.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.669
And you?
What do you want?

20:19.710 --> 20:21.917
I simply want to be
at the right hand of someone

20:21.950 --> 20:24.043
who's got a hold
of this business.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.239
I realize that you have

20:25.290 --> 20:27.019
a delicate situation
on your hands.

20:27.050 --> 20:30.087
What, just 'cause our kids
are engaged to be married

20:30.120 --> 20:32.281
you don't think
I'll kill the bitch?

20:32.330 --> 20:33.649
Did you forget?

20:36.160 --> 20:38.958
BOAZ: Camila better watch
her ass and her damn head.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.763
Damn it!

20:45.410 --> 20:48.379
(tense music)

20:48.410 --> 20:51.709
*

20:51.750 --> 20:53.308
JAMES: As soon as
the Sheriff's out the way,

20:53.350 --> 20:55.716
his roadblocks will stop.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.741
La Comisin, they own
border guards, you know?

20:57.790 --> 20:59.917
They can wave
our shipments through.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.453
(chatter on police radio)

21:02.490 --> 21:04.481
James.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.486
TERESA: The cops are coming
in this direction.

21:06.530 --> 21:08.521
(sirens wailing)
Let's go.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.336
(tires screech)

21:13.370 --> 21:16.692
Freeze.
Do not move.

21:17.670 --> 21:20.230
JAMES: It's Mayo.
How the hell did he ﬁnd us?

21:20.270 --> 21:23.239
(suspenseful music)

21:23.280 --> 21:24.247
*

21:24.280 --> 21:26.999
Show me your hands.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.610
*

21:34.020 --> 21:38.821
REPORTER: (speaking Spanish)

21:46.470 --> 21:47.732
MAID: (speaking Spanish)

21:50.840 --> 21:52.705
CAMILA: (speaking Spanish)

23:07.380 --> 23:14.388
*

23:36.240 --> 23:38.640
Get down.
Let's go.

23:39.510 --> 23:41.011
Come on.
Go.

23:43.650 --> 23:45.618
Why aren't you taking us
to jail?

23:45.650 --> 23:48.483
Well, I never said
you were under arrest.

23:48.520 --> 23:52.524
MAYO: But we do have business
that needs to be settled.

23:55.630 --> 23:57.769
MAYO: Let's get out.
Get out.

23:57.800 --> 23:58.960
Get out.

24:02.100 --> 24:04.637
On your knees.
Put your face on the ground.

24:06.310 --> 24:08.733
Oh, my God, it's the reporter.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.146
I think you know
Mr. Espinoza.

24:11.180 --> 24:12.738
I don't know
who you think we are.

24:12.780 --> 24:15.749
Hey, hey, hey, let's cut
the bullshit, shall we?

24:15.780 --> 24:17.680
Save us all
a lot of time and grief.

24:18.820 --> 24:22.916
You wanted my attention, right?
Now you got it.

24:22.960 --> 24:26.259
Then let's keep it between us.
You can let him go.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.689
MAYO: You're the one that
brought him into this.

24:27.730 --> 24:29.322
Poking around my business.

24:29.360 --> 24:32.466
And then out of the blue,
this reporter calls me,

24:32.500 --> 24:35.139
starts telling me
about this video he got sent.

24:35.170 --> 24:38.333
So I'm thinking
you sent it to him.

24:38.370 --> 24:40.361
Get up.

24:40.410 --> 24:42.139
On your knees.
Get up.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.943
Look at me.
Look at me.

24:43.980 --> 24:46.540
He asked me
if I have any comment

24:46.580 --> 24:49.014
before he goes
public with it,

24:49.050 --> 24:52.884
like he's fixin'
to stick it up my ass.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.855
Gonna stick it up my ass.

24:55.890 --> 24:59.656
-Like he's got me by the balls.
SAM: (grunts)

24:59.690 --> 25:01.453
MAYO: So, you know, he says
that to me, and suddenly,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.695
I got a question for him.

25:03.730 --> 25:06.722
(suspenseful music)

25:06.770 --> 25:11.230
*

25:11.270 --> 25:13.830
Hold this.
Hold this pen!

25:13.880 --> 25:16.371
Stick it out there.

25:16.410 --> 25:20.073
That's good.
You keep it there.

25:20.110 --> 25:22.874
(breathing rapidly)

25:22.920 --> 25:27.038
Okay, so, my question is...

25:28.460 --> 25:30.382
Is the pen

25:30.420 --> 25:34.527
truly mightier than the sword?

25:34.560 --> 25:35.925
Don't do this.

25:40.870 --> 25:42.861
(muffled whimpers)

25:46.470 --> 25:50.372
MAYO: Ah!
SAM: (muffled screams)

25:50.410 --> 25:53.402
It would appear not.

25:53.450 --> 25:57.079
(whimpering)

25:57.120 --> 25:59.213
(blade swishes, sloshes)
SAM: (gurgles)

25:59.250 --> 26:02.253
(grunts)
(body thumps)

26:07.230 --> 26:09.528
From the look of things,

26:09.560 --> 26:11.562
you should not
have sent that video.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.859
MAYO: This is my town.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.539
I got eyes everywhere.

26:17.570 --> 26:20.562
You think I don't know
who you are?

26:20.610 --> 26:21.929
You think I don't know you got

26:21.980 --> 26:24.278
a $10 million bounty
on your head?

26:24.310 --> 26:26.699
We can double that
for you in cash.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.741
We'll give it to you and we'll
get out of Phoenix tonight.

26:28.780 --> 26:31.442
You think I just started
this life yesterday, son?

26:31.490 --> 26:33.412
I'll stay with you until
someone brings the money.

26:33.450 --> 26:35.486
-I'll stay with you.
MAYO: You shut up.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.524
You'll stay with me?

26:40.830 --> 26:42.627
Yeah, you'll stay with me.

26:45.300 --> 26:49.339
Tonight.
Time and place of my choosing.

26:49.370 --> 26:54.273
MAYO: Try and play me, my first
call will be to Camila Vargas.

26:54.310 --> 26:56.335
Aaron, put this woman
in my car.

26:56.380 --> 26:57.677
AARON: Come on.

26:59.210 --> 27:00.711
This way.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.257
Bury him.

27:17.300 --> 27:20.463
After all, it was you two
got him killed.

27:20.500 --> 27:27.508
*

27:34.150 --> 27:41.158
*

27:49.230 --> 27:52.267
(woman vocalizing)

28:05.580 --> 28:07.878
How could you
let them take her?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.319
We didn't have a choice.

28:09.350 --> 28:11.147
They were gonna kill us
right there.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.249
They would've had
to kill me first.

28:13.290 --> 28:15.315
He could be selling her
to Camila right now.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.850
Mayo's a greedy pig.

28:16.890 --> 28:18.357
If he could get
more money out of us,

28:18.390 --> 28:20.255
that's exactly
what he's gonna try.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.520
When they meet
for the money drop,

28:24.570 --> 28:26.162
we get one shot.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.758
We have to take
the Sheriff out.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.165
Him and his deputy.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.134
If he show his face.

28:32.210 --> 28:36.203
(cell phone vibrating)

28:37.710 --> 28:38.870
Are you all right?

28:38.910 --> 28:41.708
I'm fine.
Listen.

28:41.750 --> 28:44.583
There's_ an old drive-in
in Mesa.

28:44.620 --> 28:46.941
I'll shoot you the address,
okay?

28:46.990 --> 28:48.855
That's where he wants to meet.

28:48.890 --> 28:51.450
TERESA (over phone):
Send Pote with the money, okay?

28:51.490 --> 28:53.082
I understand.

28:53.130 --> 28:54.927
One hour.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.266
POTE: She wants us
to take the Sheriff out.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.860
Are you sure you
can even handle this?

29:03.910 --> 29:06.799
You worry about Teresa,
not me.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.809
(engine revs)

29:09.840 --> 29:13.139
(somber music)

29:13.180 --> 29:16.877
TERESA: Why do you treat
your own people like this?

29:16.920 --> 29:19.115
Why you say that?
These ain't my people.

29:19.150 --> 29:20.617
I'm my own people.

29:24.790 --> 29:26.929
Anyway, it's for
their own good.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.325
(baby crying)

29:28.360 --> 29:31.818
MAYO: You see that little
mocoso there?

29:31.870 --> 29:35.135
It's criminal what his parents
are doing to him,

29:35.170 --> 29:38.059
the kind of life
they're condemning him to.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.931
Me, I was born right here
in Arizona.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.777
This is my state.

29:42.810 --> 29:44.949
My county.

29:46.550 --> 29:48.814
But some people still don't
see it that way, you know.

29:48.850 --> 29:53.184
They see this handsome face,
and they see a criminal.

29:53.220 --> 29:55.586
A welfare leech.

29:55.620 --> 29:57.781
And you know why?
It's because of them.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.627
That's why.

29:59.660 --> 30:02.197
I cannot tell you how many
times I've gotten my ass kicked

30:02.230 --> 30:04.323
by white kids
when I was growing up.

30:04.370 --> 30:07.294
(chatter on police radio)

30:07.330 --> 30:09.639
I gotta be twice as hard
on my own kind

30:09.670 --> 30:13.037
to change people's perceptions.

30:13.070 --> 30:17.439
All my life I've been hearing
about White Man's Burden.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.176
Then I ﬁnally come
to realize that

30:20.210 --> 30:22.713
I'm laboring
under Mayo's Burden.

30:24.550 --> 30:28.088
It's like it's my own
personal cross to bear.

30:30.860 --> 30:32.851
It's what it is.

30:34.530 --> 30:37.966
(cell phone vibrates)

TERESA: He's on his way
with the money.

that something's off,

you're dead.

You're not touching shit

Boss?

31:53.610 --> 31:56.579
We're gonna get out

a short while ago

34:53.150 --> 34:56.256
after a shootout involving
two police officers.

34:56.290 --> 34:58.053
We have few details
at this time,

34:58.090 --> 35:00.285
but we're told Sheriff Mayo
is in critical condition.

we're done.

a better shot.

away from him.

You missed.

but it's not getting better.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.651
Why didn't you tell me
how bad it was?

35:35.700 --> 35:39.488
Because I am a soldado.
This is all I know.

35:39.530 --> 35:41.589
This is what my father
raised me to be.

of my patrn,

Espinoza was investigating...

Let's get one of these bags
and replace it with real cash.

36:10.030 --> 36:13.022
And deliver it to
the journalist's wife.

36:13.070 --> 36:14.264
Anonymously.

that you're safe.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.121
My uncle is beside himself.

36:45.430 --> 36:47.694
The worst part of it

36:47.730 --> 36:50.494
is that it_ was a desecration
to Epifanio's memory.

36:50.540 --> 36:54.374
CAMILA: The sicario
was one of Boaz's men.

without you, General.

37:24.510 --> 37:27.536
Boaz fell in your trap
like a hen to a fox.

37:27.570 --> 37:29.299
Heroin was your idea.

37:29.340 --> 37:31.570
But you knew

37:31.610 --> 37:34.875
that photo of you
and Agent Loya

37:34.920 --> 37:38.913
would push him into an attack.

Bravo to both of us.

An attack on the Governor
cannot go unanswered,

infrared cameras

38:52.090 --> 38:53.682

With redundancies,
in case we get swept.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.024
What does that mean?

38:57.060 --> 38:58.698
Oh, we installed a backup
in the main room,

38:58.730 --> 39:00.721
so if one set of cameras
is shut down,

39:00.770 --> 39:02.465
then we have another one
up and running,

39:02.500 --> 39:05.537
and the entire system
is linked to your phone.

39:05.570 --> 39:07.299
Thank you.

Who else can see this?

Anyone you give access to.

39:44.950 --> 39:47.669
Not expected to regain
consciousness.

Good news is the undersheriff
who's taking over for him

39:50.450 --> 39:51.712
comes cheap.

39:51.750 --> 39:53.217
There'll be
a little bit of heat

39:53.250 --> 39:55.013
to keep up appearances,

39:55.060 --> 39:56.880
but he'll play nice,

But you haven't heard
the punch line yet.

40:11.640 --> 40:15.132
The guy who found Mayo,
maybe saved his life,

40:15.180 --> 40:18.877
he's an illegal.

40:35.830 --> 40:38.526
Are you gonna invite us
for some wine or...

40:40.100 --> 40:41.465
Of course.

40:59.620 --> 41:01.850
Came across_a little _
something here in Phoenix.

41:01.890 --> 41:03.517
You might be interested.

41:05.530 --> 41:06.758
There's only one way

41:06.790 --> 41:08.018
the Sheriff
could've known about us.

41:08.060 --> 41:11.097
Someone in La Comisin
sold us out.

41:11.130 --> 41:14.099
One of them probably cut
a side deal with Mayo.

41:14.130 --> 41:15.836
If not all of them.

41:15.870 --> 41:17.838
TERESA: Taza backed me.

41:19.470 --> 41:21.529
Pecas tried to stop me
from moving against Mayo.

41:21.580 --> 41:24.299
JAMES: I'd say
he's a likely candidate.

41:24.340 --> 41:27.377
(chuckles)

41:27.410 --> 41:30.379
(exhales deeply, clears throat)

41:30.420 --> 41:32.411
(wine glasses clinking)

41:36.260 --> 41:39.479
To our prosperous future
doing business together.

41:39.530 --> 41:42.954
*

41:43.000 --> 41:46.060
TERESA: To our future.
Salud.

41:46.100 --> 41:48.660
*

42:09.060 --> 42:10.049
(film reel whirring)

42:10.090 --> 42:13.025
(typewriter keys clacking)

42:13.060 --> 42:14.550
