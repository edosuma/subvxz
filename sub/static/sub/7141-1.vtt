01:27.034 --> 01:29.969
Hey, can I get another drink
down here?

01:30.037 --> 01:32.130
I've been to prison once.

01:32.206 --> 01:34.731
I've been married twice.

01:34.809 --> 01:37.073
I was once drafted by
Lyndon Johnson and had to live

01:37.144 --> 01:41.240
in shit-ass Mexico for two
and a half years for no reason.

01:41.315 --> 01:44.910
I've had my eye socket
punched in, a kidney taken out,

01:44.985 --> 01:48.546
and I got a bone chip in my
ankle that's never gonna heal.

01:49.256 --> 01:52.453
I've seen some pretty shitty
situations in my life.

01:52.526 --> 01:55.859
But nothing has ever sucked
more ass than this.

01:56.764 --> 01:59.426
If I'd known I was gonna have to
put up with screaming brats

01:59.500 --> 02:01.468
pissing on my lap for 30 days
out of the year,

02:01.535 --> 02:05.164
I would have killed myself
a long time ago.

02:07.708 --> 02:11.166
Come to think of it,
I still might.

02:12.546 --> 02:15.140
Where I come from,
we didn't celebrate Christmas.

02:15.216 --> 02:17.377
Not because we were Jewish,
but because my dad

02:17.451 --> 02:20.352
was a worthless-coward fucking
asshole whose idea of a present

02:20.421 --> 02:23.083
was a daily punch
to the back of the head.

02:23.157 --> 02:25.751
He did teach me
how to crack a safe, though.

02:27.161 --> 02:30.597
My dad never did shit with his
life, so he took it out on me.

02:30.664 --> 02:33.724
You could say I'm no different.
I'd have to say you were right.

02:33.801 --> 02:36.395
But at this point,
it's too late to start over.

02:36.470 --> 02:38.461
Funny how things work out.

02:38.539 --> 02:40.837
It's fucking hilarious.

03:01.896 --> 03:04.262
There's Santa Claus.
Look there.

03:08.569 --> 03:10.036
Wow.

03:15.309 --> 03:17.402
Oh, my.
What a darling photo.

03:17.478 --> 03:19.378
Are you certain you only want
the single?

03:19.447 --> 03:22.644
Additional photos come in handy
as gifts for Grandma and Grandpa

03:22.716 --> 03:25.082
or as a wonderful remembrance
for friends.

03:25.152 --> 03:26.176
Gee.
You know what?

03:26.253 --> 03:28.221
This one, I think it's more
than enough.

03:28.289 --> 03:31.122
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.

03:31.725 --> 03:33.659
So, what do you want,
little girl?

03:33.727 --> 03:35.524
A drum set.

03:35.596 --> 03:37.461
Oh, the old man will love that.

03:37.531 --> 03:39.761
Okay. Fine.
See you later.

03:48.976 --> 03:51.035
I saw you at another mall.

03:51.111 --> 03:52.908
Well, I'm very happy for you.

03:52.980 --> 03:54.811
You're not really Santa.

03:54.882 --> 03:57.180
If you were Santa,
you could do magic.

03:57.251 --> 03:59.276
You want to see some magic?

03:59.353 --> 04:01.685
Here.
Let's watch you disappear.

04:02.423 --> 04:04.823
Watch the bladder, kid.
Santa's got to pee.

04:04.892 --> 04:06.883
- What do you want?
- A new bike.

04:06.961 --> 04:08.929
Wow. That's a new one.
Excellent.

04:08.996 --> 04:10.293
Attention, shoppers.

04:10.364 --> 04:12.093
The store will be closing
in five minutes.

04:12.166 --> 04:13.895
We hope tomorrow is
a pleasant Christmas.

04:13.968 --> 04:15.230
Thank you for shopping with us.

04:15.302 --> 04:17.862
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's the last one.

04:17.938 --> 04:20.168
Thank the fuck Christ.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.809
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.

04:22.877 --> 04:25.072
You pissed yourself.

04:29.450 --> 04:31.441
Aw, Jesus.

04:33.487 --> 04:35.045
Yeah, all right.

04:35.122 --> 04:36.680
Yeah.

04:37.925 --> 04:40.985
Hey, happy holidays.
All right.

04:41.061 --> 04:42.619
Merry Christmas.

04:43.163 --> 04:44.721
Happy holidays.

04:44.798 --> 04:45.992
Get home safe.

04:46.066 --> 04:47.693
Yeah, okay.

04:47.768 --> 04:49.065
I don't care what he says.

04:49.136 --> 04:51.297
- We're going out for a beer.
- What the fuck?

04:51.372 --> 04:53.431
I'll get right back to you.

04:53.507 --> 04:55.941
What the hell's wrong with you?
I'm trying to fucking leave.

04:56.010 --> 04:57.341
Pants are awful baggy.

04:57.411 --> 04:59.379
You got anything in there?

04:59.446 --> 05:02.176
Yeah. My dick.
You want to see it?

05:03.651 --> 05:05.585
Keep pushing me.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.518
I got my eyes on you.

05:07.588 --> 05:09.317
All the time.

06:12.553 --> 06:14.180
Ready.

06:18.258 --> 06:19.350
Jesus.

07:00.067 --> 07:02.365
- How's it going?
- I'm finished when I'm finished.

07:02.436 --> 07:03.698
I'm going back upstairs.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.602
I need a melon baller
and a loofah.

07:07.441 --> 07:09.238
Got it.

07:12.513 --> 07:14.538
Fuck the loofah.
Let's go.

07:21.388 --> 07:23.379
Marcus, you get the loofah?

07:23.457 --> 07:25.015
Drive.

07:26.994 --> 07:28.427
Oh!

07:31.565 --> 07:34.659
<i>Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle bell rock</i>

07:34.735 --> 07:38.136
<i>Jingle bells chime
in jingle bell time</i>

07:38.205 --> 07:40.503
Oh, I'm dizzy.
Put me down.

07:40.574 --> 07:41.563
Hey, put me down.

07:41.642 --> 07:43.405
Come on!
Put me down.

07:44.545 --> 07:47.446
Oh, come on.

07:48.415 --> 07:50.542
Oh, man.

07:54.755 --> 07:56.746
Hey, baby, two more of these,
all right?

07:56.824 --> 07:58.917
No.
That's it for me.

07:59.493 --> 08:02.087
You can't drink worth a shit,
you know that?

08:03.964 --> 08:06.797
I weigh 92 pounds, you dick.

08:07.968 --> 08:10.732
Come on. One more.
It's a celebration.

08:12.506 --> 08:13.939
Here's to you.

08:14.007 --> 08:17.841
<i>To have the blues</i>

08:17.911 --> 08:21.870
<i>My baby's gone</i>

08:21.949 --> 08:24.611
You're getting worse,
you know that?

08:24.685 --> 08:26.778
Well, at least I got it open.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.788
It took you long enough.

08:28.856 --> 08:32.519
I remember when you could unlock
a lock like it was nothing.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.688
Yeah, well, you don't have to
worry about me anymore.

08:37.798 --> 08:38.822
I'm out.

08:38.899 --> 08:40.628
Bullshit.

08:41.668 --> 08:44.034
Bullshit, my ass.

08:44.671 --> 08:47.970
We just made $ 111,000
in one night.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.703
Exactly. I figure I got enough
to go to Miami.

08:50.778 --> 08:52.211
And do what?

08:52.279 --> 08:53.803
I don't know. Shit.
Get a car.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.441
Get a place, maybe.

08:56.517 --> 08:59.816
Maybe start a business.
A bar out on the beach.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.616
Something like that.

09:02.122 --> 09:06.456
I could quit drinking
and run the place.

09:06.527 --> 09:08.722
Maybe marry a waitress.

09:11.565 --> 09:12.862
What?

09:12.933 --> 09:14.730
You ain't gonna do shit
except go down there

09:14.802 --> 09:16.599
and drink your fucking ass off.

09:16.670 --> 09:18.399
You're gonna piss
everything away

09:18.472 --> 09:21.532
and end up counting the days
till next Christmas.

09:22.209 --> 09:24.177
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

09:24.244 --> 09:25.768
Well, it ain't gonna happen.

09:26.580 --> 09:28.548
If I call you next December...

09:28.615 --> 09:30.776
<i>if I call you next December...</i>

09:30.851 --> 09:32.819
you're gonna be so happy
to hear from me

09:32.886 --> 09:35.116
you're gonna do
a goddamn backflip.

09:35.189 --> 09:37.453
You're gonna put
that Santa hat on so fast

09:37.524 --> 09:39.924
that you're gonna get
fucking hat-burn.

09:40.761 --> 09:42.820
Can I get you guys two more?

09:47.701 --> 09:49.794
No, thanks.
We're all right.

09:52.506 --> 09:54.235
See?

09:54.308 --> 09:56.674
I'm already on the wagon.

10:29.076 --> 10:30.270
Hey. Asshole!

10:30.344 --> 10:31.902
How many times
I got to tell you?

10:31.979 --> 10:33.810
Get out from behind my bar!

10:35.148 --> 10:37.048
Put the drink down right now.

10:37.117 --> 10:39.415
Put the drink down right now!

10:39.486 --> 10:41.147
Ahh.
Fuck you.

10:41.221 --> 10:42.654
- Fuck me, huh?
- Right.

10:42.723 --> 10:45.248
Oh. Hey!

10:45.826 --> 10:47.316
Ow!

10:47.394 --> 10:49.828
Get the fuck out of my bar.

10:52.432 --> 10:53.922
Fuck you!

10:54.001 --> 10:55.025
You're fucking crazy.

10:55.102 --> 10:56.831
Fucking prick.

10:57.571 --> 10:58.765
Asshole!

10:58.839 --> 11:01.205
Get the fuck out of here
right now!

11:37.244 --> 11:39.542
<i>Have a holly
jolly Christmas</i>

11:39.613 --> 11:42.377
<i>And in case you didn't hear</i>

11:42.449 --> 11:45.976
<i>Oh, by golly,
have a holly jolly...</i>

11:46.053 --> 11:47.680
Fucking shit!

11:47.754 --> 11:53.087
Fuck you!

14:45.031 --> 14:46.965
Yeah, baby.

14:49.436 --> 14:52.599
Hey, Tiffany, you want to play
"Hide the Nazi" one day?

14:59.746 --> 15:01.577
God damn it.

15:04.151 --> 15:06.085
Here you go, sweetie.

15:07.554 --> 15:09.488
I got something
for your pretty ass.

15:09.556 --> 15:11.683
- You do?
- Yeah.

15:14.494 --> 15:16.894
Wow. $5.

15:16.963 --> 15:17.952
Thanks.

15:23.003 --> 15:26.404
I gotta listen to my messages,
and you need to take a shower.

15:27.073 --> 15:29.337
I'm a dancer.
I sweat.

15:29.409 --> 15:32.003
Yeah, well, you smell like
a bum's nut sac.

15:32.078 --> 15:34.103
Fuck you.

15:38.084 --> 15:41.611
Message one.

15:41.688 --> 15:43.053
Mr. Soke?

15:43.123 --> 15:47.150
This is Andrew Kaplan again,
from the collection agency.

15:47.227 --> 15:49.695
Message two.

15:49.763 --> 15:51.754
This is Dolores Axelrod.

15:51.831 --> 15:53.856
You ran into my car last week.

15:53.934 --> 15:55.333
I called State Farm,

15:55.402 --> 15:58.803
but they have no record
of any insurance policy for you.

15:58.872 --> 16:01.500
In case you misplaced it,
my phone number is 4...

16:01.575 --> 16:03.475
Message three.

16:03.543 --> 16:06.876
Willie, it's Marcus.
It's that time of year again.

16:06.947 --> 16:10.110
Pack your shit.
Phoenix.

16:10.217 --> 16:13.744
<i>Oh, the weather outside
is frightful</i>

16:13.787 --> 16:17.314
<i>But the fire
is so delightful</i>

16:17.390 --> 16:20.791
<i>And since we've no place
to go</i>

16:20.860 --> 16:24.193
<i>Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow</i>

16:24.264 --> 16:27.927
<i>Man, it doesn't show signs
of stopping</i>

16:28.001 --> 16:31.903
<i>And I brought me some corn
for popping</i>

16:31.972 --> 16:35.100
<i>The lights are turned
way down low</i>

16:35.175 --> 16:41.341
<i>Let it snow, let it snow</i>

16:46.019 --> 16:47.543
Jesus Christ!

16:47.621 --> 16:50.920
Can you maybe keep it together
for just 10 minutes?

16:57.530 --> 17:00.522
Harrison, just let me explain,
please. Financially...

17:00.600 --> 17:02.534
Well, you get what you paid for,
Chipeska.

17:02.602 --> 17:04.297
Five Christmases I've been here.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.464
You flip me for some stranger
who'll do it for peanuts

17:06.539 --> 17:09.064
and who happens to work
with a real midget.

17:09.142 --> 17:11.337
Nobody cares.
Nobody comes here for the elf.

17:11.411 --> 17:12.742
Santa's the attraction.

17:12.811 --> 17:14.279
I do Burl Ives songs.

17:14.347 --> 17:16.109
Does this schmo
even play guitar?

17:16.182 --> 17:19.640
Look, Harrison, it's not about
the money or the midget.

17:19.719 --> 17:21.482
Believe me, if it was, I...

17:21.554 --> 17:23.249
I don't think they like
"midget. "

17:23.323 --> 17:25.086
I think you're supposed to
call them...

17:25.157 --> 17:27.592
Oh, just forget it.

17:28.895 --> 17:30.624
Hacks!

17:31.164 --> 17:32.028
Hi.

17:32.098 --> 17:34.498
Bob Chipeska.
Welcome.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.558
Great photo and résumé,
by the way.

17:36.636 --> 17:37.398
Thanks.

17:37.470 --> 17:39.563
We've been at this
a long time and all.

17:39.639 --> 17:41.402
We'd like to think we do
a good job.

17:41.474 --> 17:44.068
I'm so glad you guys could
come in on such short notice.

17:44.144 --> 17:46.704
I must say,
your look is just sensational.

17:46.780 --> 17:47.439
Thanks.

17:47.514 --> 17:50.347
We've been at this for years.
You got nothing to worry about.

17:50.417 --> 17:53.284
You two are the best men
for this job, truly.

17:53.353 --> 17:56.686
So don't let his unpleasantness
affect your performance.

17:56.756 --> 17:58.724
- Oh, no. We're fine.
- Performance?

17:58.792 --> 18:01.693
Yes. Uh, your performance.
You know, the, um...

18:01.761 --> 18:03.956
Performance, like sexual?

18:05.131 --> 18:06.291
- Excuse me?
- Willie.

18:06.366 --> 18:08.698
Are you saying there's
something wrong with my gear?

18:08.768 --> 18:10.065
Is that what you're saying?

18:10.136 --> 18:11.603
- I'm sorry. Your gear?
- Willie.

18:11.671 --> 18:13.468
My fuck stick.

18:15.175 --> 18:17.006
Hey, Willie.
Take a seat.

18:17.077 --> 18:18.544
You know how
your blood sugar is.

18:18.611 --> 18:22.069
He's not going to say "fuck
stick" in front of the children?

18:22.148 --> 18:24.082
No, no, no.
It's a joke.

18:24.150 --> 18:27.483
An adult joke for us adults.

18:27.554 --> 18:29.317
It's a joke.
Just a joke.

18:36.029 --> 18:36.996
"Fuck stick"?

18:37.063 --> 18:39.998
Yes. I thought it was
very strange, too.

18:40.066 --> 18:42.557
So, as our security chief,

18:42.635 --> 18:44.762
I wanted you to be aware.

18:44.838 --> 18:47.102
But his little friend promised
he wouldn't say it

18:47.173 --> 18:49.164
in front of the children,
which is fine.

18:49.242 --> 18:52.700
Because, you know,
there is an adult world

18:52.779 --> 18:55.247
and a child's world,
and that's okay.

18:55.315 --> 18:57.078
I'm no censor.

18:57.150 --> 18:57.912
"Little friend"?

18:57.984 --> 19:00.919
Yes, he happens to be a dwarf.

19:00.987 --> 19:03.615
Or midget.

19:03.690 --> 19:06.056
I don't know
what he's called exactly.

19:06.126 --> 19:09.527
But, uh, he's a little guy.

19:09.596 --> 19:12.463
Little Billy Barty.
God rest.

19:12.532 --> 19:13.658
But thin fingers.

19:13.733 --> 19:18.227
Not the fat sausage fingers.

19:20.273 --> 19:22.207
"Little people. "
That's what they like.

19:22.275 --> 19:25.767
Yes. Uh, right.
Little people.

19:25.845 --> 19:27.836
So "fuck stick. "
That's it?

19:28.782 --> 19:30.647
Yeah.

19:35.688 --> 19:41.688
Merry Christmas!
Santa's coming. Yay!

19:41.761 --> 19:44.252
Merry Christmas!

19:49.369 --> 19:51.701
Have you seen that new Santa
they just hired?

19:51.771 --> 19:54.239
Yeah.
He's back there drunk.

19:58.278 --> 20:02.078
He's coming, guys.
Santa will be here real soon.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.485
God damn it!

20:08.555 --> 20:11.581
What the fuck you doing?
You blow this, and we're broke.

20:11.658 --> 20:13.285
So stop acting
like you know something.

20:13.359 --> 20:15.054
'Cause, pal of mine,
you don't know squat!

20:15.128 --> 20:17.028
Now, put on your hat
and get out there.

20:17.096 --> 20:20.224
And try to act professional,
for Christ's sakes.

20:25.839 --> 20:27.568
What do you want?

20:27.640 --> 20:29.164
What?

20:29.242 --> 20:30.800
Get out of here.

20:30.877 --> 20:32.606
Next.

20:33.446 --> 20:35.277
Next.

20:35.348 --> 20:37.782
Oh, good.
What do you want?

20:39.152 --> 20:41.052
What do you want?
What are you doing?

20:43.256 --> 20:44.245
God damn it!

20:44.324 --> 20:46.485
Nintendo Deer Hunter 3.

20:46.559 --> 20:48.527
I don't give a shit
what you want.

20:48.595 --> 20:51.257
Blowing snot all over everybody
and fucking whatever.

20:51.331 --> 20:53.356
Next.
Come on.

20:55.301 --> 20:56.859
What do you want?

20:56.936 --> 20:59.200
- Um, Santa?
- Yeah, I'm Santa.

20:59.272 --> 21:00.466
Come on.
What do you want?

21:00.540 --> 21:02.701
- Um, Barbie.
- Say cheese.

21:02.775 --> 21:03.969
Okay. Fine.
Barbie.

21:04.043 --> 21:05.305
Oh, thank you.

21:05.378 --> 21:08.347
Ow! Watch the toenails, kid!
Shit.

21:08.414 --> 21:09.711
Next.

21:10.817 --> 21:12.751
Next!

21:15.188 --> 21:16.280
What do you want?

21:16.356 --> 21:18.881
Fraggle-Stick car.

21:18.958 --> 21:20.949
What the fuck is that?

21:21.027 --> 21:22.585
Fraggle-Stick car.

21:22.662 --> 21:25.631
Well, I heard you.
Fraggle-Stick car. Fine.

21:40.413 --> 21:42.506
Hey, check out this loser.

21:43.082 --> 21:45.448
Hey, fat-ass.
How you doing today?

21:47.554 --> 21:49.112
Hey, loser.

21:49.188 --> 21:51.019
Hey, dipshit.

21:51.090 --> 21:52.648
Moron.

21:53.192 --> 21:55.592
Hey, loser.
How you doing today?

21:56.396 --> 21:58.728
Dumb-ass,
why don't you turn around?

22:01.868 --> 22:04.336
You know what?
Fuck this.

22:09.042 --> 22:10.600
You're next.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.668
Next.

22:12.745 --> 22:16.112
I said next, God damn it.
This is not the DMV, all right?

22:16.182 --> 22:17.877
Move it along.

22:19.919 --> 22:22.319
What's your name?
You can tell me.

22:24.424 --> 22:26.688
I know.
How about Santa?

22:26.759 --> 22:29.319
If you don't tell him,
you won't get a present.

22:30.430 --> 22:31.454
That's right.

22:31.531 --> 22:34.500
Come on and tell Santa
all about it.

22:38.137 --> 22:39.126
What do you want?

22:41.374 --> 22:42.966
Well, come on.
What do you want?

22:43.042 --> 22:44.907
A snot-rag?

22:47.914 --> 22:50.075
Great.
Another fucking Mongoloid.

22:50.149 --> 22:53.482
Marcus, get this kid off me
before he pisses on me.

22:53.553 --> 22:55.214
Don't fuck with my beard.

22:55.288 --> 22:56.755
It's not real.

22:56.823 --> 22:58.313
No shit.

22:58.391 --> 22:59.619
Well, it was real.

22:59.692 --> 23:03.025
But, you see, I got sick
and all the hair fell out.

23:03.096 --> 23:05.030
How did you get sick?

23:05.632 --> 23:07.566
I loved a woman
who wasn't clean.

23:07.634 --> 23:08.726
Mrs. Santa?

23:08.801 --> 23:10.029
No.
It was her sister.

23:10.103 --> 23:12.230
What's it like
at the North Pole?

23:12.305 --> 23:13.670
Like the suburbs.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.230
Which one?

23:16.142 --> 23:17.439
Apache Junction.

23:17.510 --> 23:20.274
What the fuck do you care?
Now, get off my lap.

23:20.346 --> 23:22.337
You sit there
like a fucking retard.

23:22.415 --> 23:24.383
You are really Santa, right?

23:24.450 --> 23:25.781
No.
I'm an accountant.

23:25.852 --> 23:29.310
I wear this fucking thing as
a fashion statement, all right?

23:29.389 --> 23:31.118
Okay.

23:31.190 --> 23:33.715
Get this kid out of here.
He's freaking me out.

23:39.499 --> 23:42.832
I got to get a drink on.
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:42.902 --> 23:45.598
Just don't come into work
stinking of booze again.

23:45.672 --> 23:47.139
Yeah.
Why don't you get going?

23:47.206 --> 23:50.198
You'll be late for your
"Wizard of Oz" Candy Bar Guild.

23:50.276 --> 23:52.676
Lollipop Guild, you asshole.
Jesus!

23:52.745 --> 23:55.145
Two-year-olds flip me shit
better than you.

23:55.214 --> 23:56.306
You saying something to me?

23:56.382 --> 23:59.715
Yeah. I'm gonna stick
my whole fist up your ass.

24:07.994 --> 24:10.588
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

24:10.663 --> 24:12.824
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

24:12.899 --> 24:17.063
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

24:17.136 --> 24:19.661
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

24:19.739 --> 24:21.764
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

24:21.841 --> 24:26.107
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

24:26.179 --> 24:30.741
<i>Dashing through the snow
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

24:30.817 --> 24:35.277
<i>O'er the fields we go,
laughing all the way</i>

24:35.354 --> 24:37.914
<i>Bells on bobtail ring,
making spirits bright</i>

24:37.990 --> 24:39.423
What?

24:39.492 --> 24:44.122
<i>What fun it is to ride and
sing a sleighing song tonight</i>

24:44.197 --> 24:47.030
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

24:47.100 --> 24:48.032
Mmm.

24:48.101 --> 24:51.161
Another Grand-Dad, Santa?

24:51.237 --> 24:52.169
Yeah.

24:52.238 --> 24:53.330
Yeah?

24:53.406 --> 24:55.601
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

24:55.675 --> 24:57.734
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

24:57.810 --> 24:59.368
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride</i>

24:59.445 --> 25:01.072
Got a name?

25:03.049 --> 25:04.778
Yeah.

25:06.619 --> 25:09.383
So, what do you do, you know...

25:09.455 --> 25:10.888
After the holidays, I mean.

25:10.957 --> 25:13.892
Well, nothing till March,
and then I'm the Easter Bunny.

25:18.731 --> 25:19.891
Oh. Another?

25:19.966 --> 25:21.399
Yeah. Why not?

25:25.138 --> 25:26.537
Merry Christmas.

25:30.576 --> 25:32.669
Not a big talker.

25:32.745 --> 25:34.303
No, not really.

25:37.049 --> 25:38.710
- Buy you one?
- Why not?

25:44.490 --> 25:46.151
Happy New Year.

25:49.295 --> 25:51.786
You're pretty regular
for a Santa.

25:51.864 --> 25:53.525
It's not that big
a fucking deal.

25:53.599 --> 25:55.794
It's just a job,
you know what I mean?

25:55.868 --> 26:00.237
I'm an eating, drinking,
shitting, fucking Santy Claus.

26:01.941 --> 26:03.306
Prove it.

26:06.279 --> 26:07.541
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.

26:07.613 --> 26:10.741
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.

26:10.817 --> 26:12.375
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa!

26:12.451 --> 26:13.816
Can't I at least take
this hat off?

26:13.886 --> 26:15.581
No. I love the hat.

26:15.655 --> 26:17.452
Okay.

26:17.523 --> 26:20.686
Whoo!

26:24.797 --> 26:29.029
I've always had a thing
for Santa Claus.

26:29.101 --> 26:30.728
In case you didn't notice.

26:30.803 --> 26:33.795
It's like some deep-seated
childhood thing.

26:33.873 --> 26:35.807
So is my thing for tits.

26:35.875 --> 26:38.139
Yeah.
It is like that, though.

26:38.211 --> 26:39.405
From when you're a kid.

26:39.478 --> 26:41.810
'Cause my dad was Jewish,
and we didn't have Christmas.

26:41.881 --> 26:46.375
So it was like
this forbidden thing.

26:49.455 --> 26:51.116
So...

26:53.826 --> 26:55.123
I like you.

26:57.230 --> 26:59.528
Don't mothball that suit.

27:06.272 --> 27:07.204
What the fuck?

27:07.273 --> 27:09.264
I am not gay.

27:10.243 --> 27:12.268
- What the hell, buddy?
- Buddy?

27:12.345 --> 27:14.245
I said I am not gay.

27:14.313 --> 27:17.441
Are you off your fucking meds
or something?

27:17.516 --> 27:18.983
Yes.

27:19.051 --> 27:21.713
But that isn't
what this is about.

27:21.787 --> 27:23.482
You're as queer as a $ 10 bill.

27:23.556 --> 27:25.888
Let me tell you something,
motherfucker.

27:25.958 --> 27:29.655
My brother lost a goddamn arm
fighting you fuckers in Vietnam.

27:29.729 --> 27:32.926
So I want you to look at my face
one last fucking time.

27:32.999 --> 27:35.627
This is the last thing you're
ever gonna see before I...

27:35.701 --> 27:36.668
Elf fucker!

27:36.736 --> 27:38.829
- Motherfucker!
- Turn around, elf fucker.

27:38.905 --> 27:41.373
Who's the bitch now,
Santy Claus? Huh?

27:41.440 --> 27:43.169
Faggy Claus!
Faggy!

27:43.242 --> 27:44.504
Leave Santa alone!

27:44.577 --> 27:47.876
Little boy, don't interfere.
I am doing this for all of us.

27:47.947 --> 27:49.710
Leave Santa alone!

27:53.853 --> 27:56.185
Ass clown.

28:03.296 --> 28:05.230
Hey, you're that kid.

28:06.966 --> 28:09.025
What the fuck are you
doing here?

28:22.148 --> 28:24.412
This one fucking time
I take you home, okay?

28:24.483 --> 28:25.472
Uh-huh.

28:25.551 --> 28:26.984
I'm not your fucking dada.

28:27.053 --> 28:28.748
Uh-huh.

28:30.423 --> 28:33.358
It's not like you helped me
with that nutjob or anything.

28:33.426 --> 28:35.087
- Uh-huh.
- You're the right height.

28:35.161 --> 28:37.755
You're right there
to grab his balls.

28:37.830 --> 28:40.025
- You could twist them.
- Why do you need a car?

28:40.099 --> 28:43.159
- What?
- This car.

28:43.235 --> 28:44.167
Which turn is it?

28:44.236 --> 28:46.329
Sage Terrace.
Where's your sleigh?

28:46.405 --> 28:48.566
It's in the shop,
getting repaired.

28:48.641 --> 28:51.075
- Where are the reindeer?
- I stabled them.

28:51.143 --> 28:52.405
Is it left or right?

28:52.478 --> 28:53.502
That way.

28:53.579 --> 28:55.206
Where's the stable?

28:55.281 --> 28:57.442
- Next to the shop.
- How do they sleep?

28:57.516 --> 28:59.609
Who? The reindeer?
Standing up.

28:59.685 --> 29:01.152
But the noise.
How do they sleep?

29:01.220 --> 29:03.211
- What noise?
- From the shop.

29:04.657 --> 29:06.750
They only work during the day,
all right?

29:06.826 --> 29:08.589
I thought it was always night
at the North Pole.

29:08.661 --> 29:10.595
Well, not now.
Right now it's always day.

29:10.663 --> 29:11.857
Then how do they sleep?

29:11.931 --> 29:14.229
Oh, shit. Sage Terrace.

29:14.300 --> 29:17.758
What is it with you? Somebody
drop you on your fucking head?

29:17.837 --> 29:19.236
<i>On my head?</i>

29:19.305 --> 29:21.569
Are they gonna drop you
on somebody else's head?

29:21.640 --> 29:23.301
How can they drop me
onto my own head?

29:23.376 --> 29:26.140
<i>No, not onto your...
Would...</i>

29:26.212 --> 29:29.272
God damn it!
Are you fucking with me?

29:33.319 --> 29:35.253
Okay.
Which house is it?

29:35.321 --> 29:36.583
That one.

29:36.655 --> 29:38.520
With Jesus and his family
there or what?

29:38.591 --> 29:40.149
No.
The one beside that.

29:40.226 --> 29:42.057
- Right here?
- Yeah. That one.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.618
All right.

29:51.804 --> 29:53.772
Nice digs.

29:55.074 --> 29:56.507
Is Daddy home?

29:56.575 --> 29:58.543
He's on an adventure,
exploring mountains.

29:58.611 --> 30:00.044
He's been gone a long time.

30:00.112 --> 30:03.843
Exploring mountains, huh?
How long is he gonna be gone?

30:03.916 --> 30:04.848
Till next year.

30:04.917 --> 30:06.214
Yeah?
What about Mommy?

30:06.285 --> 30:09.379
She lives in God's house with
Jesus and Mary and the ghost

30:09.455 --> 30:12.947
and the long-eared donkey and
Joseph and the talking walnut.

30:13.692 --> 30:15.489
Well, who the fuck takes care
of you, then?

30:15.561 --> 30:16.357
Grandma.

30:16.429 --> 30:18.021
Yeah?
What's her name?

30:18.097 --> 30:19.428
Grandma.

30:20.599 --> 30:22.499
Is Granny spry?

30:26.672 --> 30:27.661
Everybody!

30:27.740 --> 30:30.208
<i>D- O-L-E, Dole</i>

30:30.276 --> 30:31.402
<i>Banana shuffle</i>

30:31.477 --> 30:34.469
Grandma? Grandma?

30:34.980 --> 30:36.777
Santa's here.

30:36.849 --> 30:39.977
Oh, Roger.
You're home.

30:40.052 --> 30:42.316
Are you spry?

30:42.388 --> 30:45.653
Let me fix you some sandwiches.

30:53.065 --> 30:56.557
Are you telling me
she's the only one here?

30:56.635 --> 30:58.000
Nobody else?

30:58.070 --> 31:01.164
No aunts or cousins or uncles
or anything like that?

31:01.240 --> 31:03.208
A butler or security guard
or something?

31:03.275 --> 31:05.607
Nuh-unh.

31:05.678 --> 31:07.612
You're shitting me.

31:09.748 --> 31:11.875
Does your daddy have a safe?

31:17.857 --> 31:19.688
Need money to fix your sleigh?

31:19.758 --> 31:21.692
Exactly.

31:26.599 --> 31:28.430
You want milk and cookies?

31:28.501 --> 31:29.559
No.

31:29.635 --> 31:31.159
Should I fix you
some sandwiches?

31:31.237 --> 31:32.534
Unh-unh.

31:32.605 --> 31:34.072
Does your daddy have a car?

31:38.878 --> 31:41.244
Bye, Santa!

31:43.349 --> 31:46.682
<i>First comes the stocking
of little Nell</i>

31:46.752 --> 31:50.017
<i>Dear old Santa,
fill it well</i>

31:53.292 --> 31:54.554
Oh, my!

31:57.663 --> 31:59.563
Keep going.
- Jesus!

31:59.632 --> 32:00.929
Ohh!

32:02.201 --> 32:05.102
Oh, God!

32:05.171 --> 32:06.103
Ooh!

32:06.172 --> 32:08.936
Oh, Zena!
Oh, Mary!

32:09.008 --> 32:10.066
Keep it going.

32:10.142 --> 32:11.871
Jesus Christ!

32:11.944 --> 32:13.639
Yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby.

32:13.712 --> 32:16.237
You ain't gonna
shit right for a week.

32:16.315 --> 32:17.247
Oh!

32:17.316 --> 32:18.749
- Yeah, buddy!
- Yeah!

32:18.817 --> 32:21.149
Whoo!

32:24.623 --> 32:26.784
It won't happen again.
I can promise you that.

32:26.859 --> 32:30.090
Willie here has low blood sugar.
That's all.

32:30.162 --> 32:32.357
That's right.
I forgot to take my pill.

32:33.032 --> 32:35.830
It's not just the swearing.

32:35.901 --> 32:37.425
Um...

32:38.003 --> 32:40.437
Forgive me for prying.

32:40.506 --> 32:44.101
But did one of you, um...

32:44.176 --> 32:45.268
fornicate...

32:45.344 --> 32:46.311
Fornicate?

32:46.378 --> 32:50.075
Yes, with a heavyset woman
in the Big & Tall dressing room.

32:50.149 --> 32:52.617
Look, I've boned a lot
of fat chicks in my time, sure.

32:52.685 --> 32:57.816
But as far as I can recall,
I've never fornicated anybody.

32:57.890 --> 32:59.084
Yes, well, even still,

32:59.158 --> 33:02.093
I think it's best for
all parties considered if we...

33:02.161 --> 33:03.822
If we what?

33:04.396 --> 33:07.490
Well, I have someone else
interested in the position.

33:08.434 --> 33:09.958
Before you do something stupid,

33:10.035 --> 33:11.593
you may want to think
about this shit.

33:11.670 --> 33:12.830
What are you talking about?

33:12.905 --> 33:15.499
I'm talking about firing
a little black midget.

33:15.574 --> 33:18.134
A colored, African-American
small person.

33:18.210 --> 33:19.438
That's what I'm talking about.

33:19.511 --> 33:23.607
I'm talking about your face
all over goddamn "USA Today. "

33:23.682 --> 33:26.082
I'm talking about 150
of these little motherfuckers

33:26.151 --> 33:28.278
all over the sidewalk out there.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.254
Little picket signs,
chanting and raving.

33:30.322 --> 33:32.688
Using little bullhorns
and shit like that.

33:32.758 --> 33:35.352
Screaming and hollering
your name out.

33:35.427 --> 33:37.622
Unfair practices.
Get me?

33:37.696 --> 33:39.994
No. No, no.
This is not a handicap thing.

33:40.065 --> 33:42.329
I have nothing
against you people.

33:43.869 --> 33:45.234
"You people"?

33:45.304 --> 33:48.102
Did you hear that, Marcus?
He said, "You people. "

33:48.173 --> 33:49.470
Who the hell is "us people"?

33:49.541 --> 33:50.803
Wait. Wait.
No, no.

33:50.876 --> 33:53.106
I... You don't under...
What?

33:53.178 --> 33:55.169
He...
No, no.

33:55.247 --> 33:58.182
Um, you know, I think it's best

33:58.250 --> 34:01.117
if we just forget we had
this conversation.

34:02.921 --> 34:04.582
Okay.

34:04.657 --> 34:05.919
Good thinking.

34:05.991 --> 34:08.482
And don't worry about us.
We'll be fine.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.994
Let's get the hell
out of here, Marcus.

34:16.068 --> 34:17.295
You're pathetic.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.339
I dig that little thing
on your belly button.

34:30.416 --> 34:31.678
What's that?
Like a diamond?

34:31.750 --> 34:33.717
It's a belly-button ring.

34:33.786 --> 34:35.185
Oh, yeah?
Hang on a second.

34:35.254 --> 34:36.915
Check this out.

34:36.989 --> 34:39.719
You got to thrust.
See what I'm saying?

34:40.159 --> 34:43.389
You gotta move the ball around.
You go up there, baby.

34:43.462 --> 34:44.793
Come on.

34:44.862 --> 34:47.127
See? Move the ball.
There you go.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.429
Motherfucker!

34:49.501 --> 34:52.697
Oh, you lousy, fucking
motherfucker.

34:56.108 --> 34:58.042
That's the shit
that's gonna get us pinched.

34:58.110 --> 34:59.441
She said she was 18.

34:59.511 --> 35:00.910
But you promised no arcades.

35:00.979 --> 35:02.708
You said you'd only hustle
Big & Tall.

35:02.781 --> 35:05.579
You shat me out of your womb?
You're my fucking mom now?

35:05.651 --> 35:07.312
I don't need
any goddamn lectures.

35:07.386 --> 35:09.854
I know how to keep
a low profile. Thank you.

35:11.056 --> 35:13.786
What the fuck is this,
Mr. Low Profile?

35:13.859 --> 35:16.123
Mind your own goddamn business.

35:23.836 --> 35:25.770
Ever hear of
the open bottle law?

35:27.973 --> 35:33.036
A couple of days ago, I was in,
uh, Women's Big & Tall.

35:33.112 --> 35:35.171
And I heard these...

35:35.247 --> 35:39.343
Um, you know, these noises.

35:39.418 --> 35:43.946
And I heard a woman screaming,
"Yeah. Oh, yeah. "

35:44.022 --> 35:47.355
And I heard his voice saying,
"That's right.

35:47.426 --> 35:53.422
You ain't going to S-H-I-T
right for a month. "

35:54.733 --> 35:56.200
But don't get me wrong.

35:56.268 --> 35:59.362
I was against
the Clinton impeachment.

35:59.438 --> 36:01.429
What a man does
with his own penis...

36:01.507 --> 36:03.600
Oval Office,
Women's Big & Tall...

36:03.675 --> 36:06.371
it's not for
the American people to say.

36:06.445 --> 36:07.173
Yeah, right.

36:07.246 --> 36:10.773
But when you're dealing
with children...

36:14.019 --> 36:16.453
They have a tender sensibility.

36:16.522 --> 36:18.387
And you are in a position
of trust.

36:18.457 --> 36:24.020
I think perhaps someone who has
screaming orgasms

36:24.096 --> 36:26.724
with large women shouldn't...

36:26.799 --> 36:28.289
Yeah.

36:29.601 --> 36:31.330
Of course,
I can't fire him for that.

36:31.403 --> 36:33.633
Oh, yeah.
Unfair practices.

36:33.705 --> 36:36.265
Special pleading.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

36:36.341 --> 36:37.706
Fucking broads.

36:37.776 --> 36:39.038
But I just can't help it.

36:39.111 --> 36:42.569
There's something about the guy
that makes me uneasy.

36:42.648 --> 36:43.615
Well, sure.

36:43.682 --> 36:46.378
Santa fucking someone
in the ass.

36:48.554 --> 36:50.613
So...

36:50.689 --> 36:53.249
Maybe there's something
I could fire him for.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.492
Yeah, I get you.

36:55.561 --> 36:57.222
Do you?

36:57.296 --> 36:59.161
Do you think
you could find something?

36:59.231 --> 37:02.200
Shit, yeah.
There's always something.

37:27.459 --> 37:28.448
Shit.

37:29.661 --> 37:32.129
Hey, Opal.
Come here.

37:32.197 --> 37:33.391
Unh-unh.

37:33.465 --> 37:35.296
Screw you, Willie,
your kinky ass.

37:35.367 --> 37:37.232
Last time I didn't shit right
for a week.

37:37.302 --> 37:40.328
No, it's not that.
I need to talk to you.

37:40.405 --> 37:43.374
I'm just tired of you, Willie.

37:44.309 --> 37:45.435
Ooh.

37:47.813 --> 37:49.747
Who the fuck is in my room?

37:49.815 --> 37:51.282
Did you see somebody
go in my room?

37:51.350 --> 37:53.477
Yeah.
Some guy asking about you.

37:53.552 --> 37:54.712
Looked like a cop.

37:54.786 --> 37:56.378
Oh, shit.

37:57.689 --> 37:58.815
Marcus, it's Willie.

37:58.891 --> 38:00.984
I just got back to the motel.

38:01.059 --> 38:03.391
Some guy is nosing around
in my room.

38:03.462 --> 38:05.089
What guy?
You get a look at him?

38:05.163 --> 38:06.790
No.
But I think he's a cop, though.

38:06.865 --> 38:07.991
Think somebody's onto us?

38:08.066 --> 38:10.330
Is there anything in the room?
Anything professional?

38:10.402 --> 38:11.835
No, I just got clothes in there.

38:11.904 --> 38:13.235
Just ditch, you idiot.

38:13.305 --> 38:15.398
You got anywhere to sack out
for a while?

38:16.408 --> 38:18.171
- Santa!
- Yeah.

38:18.243 --> 38:19.835
You're bringing
my present early?

38:19.912 --> 38:21.243
No.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.980
But I never told you
what I wanted.

38:24.049 --> 38:26.882
I said I didn't bring it,
dipshit.

38:26.952 --> 38:28.419
Okay. Good.

38:28.487 --> 38:31.513
I want a stuffed elephant.
A pink one.

38:31.590 --> 38:33.581
Wish in one hand,
shit in the other one.

38:33.659 --> 38:36.492
See which one fills up first.

38:36.562 --> 38:37.995
Okay.

38:38.063 --> 38:40.258
So I'm gonna be staying here
for a while.

38:40.332 --> 38:42.357
Things are all fucked up
at the North Pole.

38:42.434 --> 38:44.459
Mrs. Santa caught me
fucking her sister.

38:44.536 --> 38:47.369
And I'm out on my ass now.

38:47.439 --> 38:49.304
She got half of everything.

38:49.374 --> 38:51.365
This is gonna be cool.

38:51.443 --> 38:53.274
This will do fine.

38:59.418 --> 39:01.409
So I'm gonna be crashing here.

39:01.486 --> 39:04.683
It will be just you and me,
like roommates, you know?

39:04.756 --> 39:06.917
Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids?

39:06.992 --> 39:08.619
No.
Thank the fuck Christ.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.662
What about the elves?

39:11.096 --> 39:13.690
Well, they stay with Mrs. Santa.

39:14.266 --> 39:15.995
I get them on the weekends.

39:16.068 --> 39:18.263
Why don't you go run me a bath?

39:22.107 --> 39:23.506
What about the reindeer?

39:23.575 --> 39:26.135
Would you please shut up
about reindeer?

39:27.713 --> 39:29.146
What are their names?

39:29.214 --> 39:30.203
Who?

39:30.282 --> 39:31.340
The elves.

39:31.416 --> 39:32.781
Oh, shit.
I can't remember.

39:32.851 --> 39:35.217
I think one of them is Sneezy.
There's a Dopey.

39:35.287 --> 39:37.187
That's the Seven Dwarfs.

39:37.255 --> 39:38.984
Oh, you're shitting me.

39:39.057 --> 39:42.151
I thought...
I was thinking it was the...

39:42.227 --> 39:43.489
I don't know.
Fuck, kid.

39:43.562 --> 39:45.655
I just call them, "bub. "

39:45.731 --> 39:47.790
I say, "Hey, bub" or "chief"
or whatever the fuck.

39:47.866 --> 39:49.629
I tell him to make
the goddamn toy.

39:49.701 --> 39:51.669
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

39:51.737 --> 39:53.500
I can't remember this shit!

39:53.572 --> 39:56.598
Does everything with you
have to be a fucking test?

39:59.211 --> 40:00.610
How old are they?

40:06.118 --> 40:07.676
You want cookies?

40:08.587 --> 40:09.576
No.

40:09.655 --> 40:10.883
Warm milk?

40:10.956 --> 40:11.854
No.

40:11.923 --> 40:13.618
Should I fix you
some sandwiches?

40:13.692 --> 40:15.455
I don't want
any fucking sandwiches.

40:15.527 --> 40:18.018
What is it with you
and fixing fucking sandwiches?

40:18.096 --> 40:20.394
Okay.
Do you want anything else?

40:20.465 --> 40:22.092
No.

40:24.169 --> 40:25.636
Okay.

40:34.112 --> 40:35.977
Santa?

40:41.119 --> 40:42.347
What?

40:42.421 --> 40:44.981
I brought you some orange juice.

40:48.060 --> 40:49.152
What's in it?

40:49.227 --> 40:50.819
Oranges.

40:53.598 --> 40:55.429
Look what I have.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.559
An Advent calendar.

40:57.636 --> 40:58.762
What the hell is that?

40:58.837 --> 41:02.603
It's the story of Christmas,
but in a calendar.

41:02.674 --> 41:04.699
Every day you peel open
a new box.

41:04.776 --> 41:06.368
You get part of the story.

41:06.445 --> 41:08.436
And then there's
a chocolate inside.

41:08.513 --> 41:11.141
Do you want to open up
today's box and read it?

41:12.117 --> 41:14.051
No.
You go ahead.

41:16.021 --> 41:19.422
Jesus Christ, kid.
Watch the nuts.

41:26.998 --> 41:30.627
"So Joseph went up from
the town of Nazareth in Galilee

41:30.702 --> 41:33.694
to Judea, to Bethlehem,
the town of David.

41:33.772 --> 41:36.707
In those days Caesar Augustus
issued a decree

41:36.775 --> 41:39.801
that a census should be taken
of the entire Roman world.

41:39.878 --> 41:43.041
Everyone went to his hometown
to register. "

41:46.184 --> 41:47.845
- That it?
- Yep.

41:47.919 --> 41:50.251
That's an awesome
fucking story, kid.

41:50.322 --> 41:53.780
There's more to it, but we
have to wait till tomorrow.

41:55.193 --> 41:57.423
Do you want to eat
the chocolate?

41:58.497 --> 41:59.555
You go ahead.

42:02.768 --> 42:05.032
Are you coming downstairs?

42:05.103 --> 42:07.765
I'll be down in a minute.
I got to go to work.

42:19.184 --> 42:20.446
Fuck me?
Fuck you.

42:20.519 --> 42:22.510
You can't just take up
with some kid.

42:22.587 --> 42:24.953
You don't know who's around
or what they do.

42:25.023 --> 42:27.457
You got some nerve,
you little shit, you.

42:27.526 --> 42:30.188
What, you're my mom now?
You shat me out of your womb?

42:30.262 --> 42:33.698
You said that yesterday,
you stupid fuck.

42:33.765 --> 42:35.392
Shit.

42:36.234 --> 42:38.134
Fuck you.

42:46.912 --> 42:49.210
You are by far the dumbest,

42:49.281 --> 42:51.909
most pathetic piece
of maggot-eating shit

42:51.983 --> 42:55.419
that has ever slid
from a human being's hairy ass.

42:56.288 --> 42:59.018
What if the kid has one of those
fucking playdates they have now?

42:59.090 --> 43:01.820
Are you shitting me?
The kid don't have any friends.

43:01.893 --> 43:05.021
He don't even have an imaginary
friend unless he ditched him.

43:05.096 --> 43:08.065
He lives with his drooling-ass
old grandmother.

43:08.133 --> 43:09.828
Sits in front of the TV
all the time.

43:09.901 --> 43:11.300
You think she's gonna
rat me out?

43:11.369 --> 43:14.304
She don't know her ass
from last Tuesday.

43:14.940 --> 43:16.305
You fuck her?

43:17.943 --> 43:19.069
Jesus Christ.

43:19.144 --> 43:21.044
Is everything fucking sex
with you?

43:21.112 --> 43:23.171
With me?
I fuck one person.

43:23.248 --> 43:24.772
I ain't out there
serial fornicating,

43:24.850 --> 43:26.977
trying to float my liver,
drinking myself silly

43:27.052 --> 43:30.078
'cause I can't stand
what a piece of shit I am.

43:30.155 --> 43:32.885
What are you,
Sigmund Sawed-off Fucking Freud?

43:32.958 --> 43:34.585
Yeah, that's right.

43:34.659 --> 43:36.217
Go ahead.
Talk about my height.

43:36.294 --> 43:37.921
Make it about something safe

43:37.996 --> 43:39.861
'cause you're
an emotional cripple.

43:39.931 --> 43:41.489
Your soul is dog shit.

43:41.566 --> 43:44.057
Every single fucking thing
about you is ugly.

43:50.809 --> 43:53.334
Come on, Lois.
Let's get out of here.

44:03.255 --> 44:06.816
Look who's here, Jimmy.
It's Santa.

44:06.892 --> 44:08.416
That's fucking great.

44:08.493 --> 44:11.053
Let's tell him what you want
for Christmas.

44:11.529 --> 44:13.190
Fuck.

44:15.734 --> 44:19.864
I'm on my fucking
lunch break, okay?

44:19.938 --> 44:21.963
Are you insane?

44:22.040 --> 44:23.837
Management's gonna hear
about this.

44:23.909 --> 44:26.343
You think that's a threat?

44:26.411 --> 44:29.574
If you think you can make my
life any worse, go right ahead.

44:29.648 --> 44:32.412
Be my fucking guest.
Take a shot.

44:41.726 --> 44:47.995
<i>It's the most wonderful time
of the year</i>

44:48.066 --> 44:49.863
<i>With the kids
jingle-belling</i>

44:49.935 --> 44:54.497
<i>And everyone telling you,
"Be of good cheer"</i>

44:54.572 --> 45:02.035
<i>It's the most wonderful time
of the year</i>

45:02.113 --> 45:04.240
Just looking.

45:04.316 --> 45:06.045
Aah!

45:11.723 --> 45:14.317
Find everything
you're looking for?

45:14.392 --> 45:16.622
Um, yeah.
Thank you.

45:16.695 --> 45:19.562
Nothing I can help
you with, huh?

45:19.631 --> 45:23.567
No. I'm just looking at
the games 'cause I have an Xbox.

45:23.635 --> 45:26.468
Get your hands
out of my pants, man!

45:26.538 --> 45:29.905
You're stealing from the store,
you're stealing from me.

45:29.975 --> 45:31.306
What is this?

45:31.376 --> 45:33.310
I was gonna pay for it.

45:33.378 --> 45:34.436
Wrong answer.

45:34.512 --> 45:36.412
When I look at you,
you know what I think?

45:36.481 --> 45:39.279
I think America has
a sad future ahead of it.

45:39.351 --> 45:41.876
And you're part
of this sorry-ass generation.

45:41.953 --> 45:43.545
What you want to be
when you grow up?

45:43.621 --> 45:45.919
I don't know.

45:45.991 --> 45:48.152
- This MP3?
- Yeah.

45:48.226 --> 45:49.591
Take it off.

45:49.661 --> 45:52.221
But my grandmother gave...

45:52.297 --> 45:54.731
Take it off. I don't care
who gave it to you.

45:54.799 --> 45:56.767
Take it off.

45:56.835 --> 45:58.735
I don't care if it choke you
to death.

45:58.803 --> 46:00.896
Now, I want you to get on
out of here. Get!

46:00.972 --> 46:02.599
- But can I have...
- Get!

46:02.674 --> 46:03.834
Happy Kwanzaa.

46:07.379 --> 46:09.347
And pull your damn pants up!

46:09.414 --> 46:11.279
What's wrong with you kids
these days?

46:12.550 --> 46:13.812
Gin?

46:13.885 --> 46:15.614
- Yeah.
- What do you need?

46:15.687 --> 46:17.416
I need you to run a plate
for me.

46:17.489 --> 46:18.615
It's Arizona plates.

46:18.690 --> 46:20.487
Hold on.
Let me get a pen.

46:47.419 --> 46:48.852
Is that it?

46:59.664 --> 47:03.600
For Christ's sake, make a move
and stick with it, would you?

47:11.709 --> 47:13.370
King me.

47:15.780 --> 47:17.645
Son of a bitch!

47:17.715 --> 47:22.345
You lousy, cheating little shit!

47:24.189 --> 47:26.749
You're fucking with me!
You did that on purpose.

47:26.825 --> 47:29.385
You play like the dead lice
are falling off of you,

47:29.461 --> 47:32.294
and then suddenly, you're like
Seabiscuit all over the place.

47:32.363 --> 47:34.854
You're a smartass,
is what you are, kid.

47:35.900 --> 47:37.663
Want to play again?

47:42.373 --> 47:43.965
Howdy.
Herb Gunner.

47:44.042 --> 47:46.408
I live two streets over
on Burning Trail Road.

47:46.478 --> 47:48.207
I don't think we've met.

47:51.116 --> 47:52.310
I'm Uncle Willie.

47:52.383 --> 47:55.147
I'm organizing the decorations
for the subdivision this year.

47:55.220 --> 47:57.654
- You mind if I come in?
- Yeah.

47:57.722 --> 48:00.122
I mean yeah, I mind.

48:00.191 --> 48:01.385
Okay. Uh...

48:01.459 --> 48:05.418
Will you be participating in our
luminarias program this year?

48:07.465 --> 48:10.298
- What the hell is a lunamaria?
- They're luminarias.

48:10.368 --> 48:12.802
Small sacks filled with
about a pound of sand each.

48:12.871 --> 48:14.839
We insert a candle
in the middle, light it,

48:14.906 --> 48:16.237
and the bag glows.

48:16.307 --> 48:17.968
Then we line
all the sidewalks here

48:18.042 --> 48:20.408
all around the neighborhood.

48:21.012 --> 48:24.948
You see, we don't celebrate
Christmas around here, so...

48:25.016 --> 48:28.247
We're, uh, we're Muslims.

48:28.319 --> 48:30.378
Look, it's my first year
running this.

48:30.455 --> 48:32.753
I'd like it if there weren't
any gaps in it.

48:32.824 --> 48:35.554
What if I come by
Christmas Eve and do it for you?

48:35.627 --> 48:37.720
No, you know what?
You don't have to do that.

48:37.795 --> 48:40.389
Yeah, me and the kid here,
we'll do something.

48:40.465 --> 48:41.727
Great.
I got the supplies.

48:41.799 --> 48:43.266
- I'll throw them in the garage.
- Perfect.

48:43.334 --> 48:45.234
Awesome.

48:45.303 --> 48:46.998
Going in the garage,
just so you know.

48:47.071 --> 48:50.700
You can make
a delicious six-pound chicken.

48:50.775 --> 48:53.903
Enough hot dogs and sausages
to feed a small army.

48:53.978 --> 48:57.209
Not one, but two delicious
rotisserie chickens.

48:57.282 --> 48:59.750
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.

48:59.817 --> 49:02.684
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.

49:02.754 --> 49:05.746
Scrumptious
61/2-pound standing rib roast.

49:05.823 --> 49:10.487
And everybody's favorite,
baby back ribs.

49:23.741 --> 49:26.972
This is such a nice house.

49:27.045 --> 49:29.570
Needs a woman's touch, though.

49:29.647 --> 49:32.639
I just rent
the fucking place anyway.

49:35.486 --> 49:37.078
Yeah.
I just rent stuff, too.

49:37.155 --> 49:38.315
Yeah?

49:45.797 --> 49:47.924
How long are you gonna be here?

49:47.999 --> 49:50.058
What? On the couch?

49:50.134 --> 49:51.761
No.

49:51.836 --> 49:53.565
In town.

49:55.139 --> 49:57.801
I don't know.
Just through the holidays.

49:57.875 --> 50:00.173
You know, then I'll move on.

50:02.547 --> 50:04.014
So, do you like kids?

50:05.216 --> 50:07.013
Fuck, no!

50:07.085 --> 50:09.553
Do you think
I'm some kind of pervert?

50:09.621 --> 50:12.522
I just mean because
you're Santa Claus.

50:13.558 --> 50:14.525
Oh.

50:14.592 --> 50:16.856
I like kids.
I really like kids.

50:16.928 --> 50:19.089
- You do?
- I love kids.

50:19.163 --> 50:20.824
Well, good.

50:22.100 --> 50:25.160
Yeah, they're something else,
those kids.

50:27.305 --> 50:29.205
And to tell you the truth...

50:30.842 --> 50:34.903
The fact of the matter is,
I'm not Santa.

50:37.682 --> 50:40.173
Like ya anyway.

50:54.632 --> 50:56.964
So, you'll call me, right?

50:57.035 --> 50:59.799
Yeah.
I'll call you.

50:59.871 --> 51:01.202
I'm gonna buy you some flowers.

51:01.272 --> 51:03.706
Some of those
really good expensive ones.

51:03.775 --> 51:05.037
Shut up.

51:07.312 --> 51:09.246
Bye.

52:16.814 --> 52:18.304
Roger, you're home.

52:18.383 --> 52:21.079
Let me fix you some sandwiches.

52:23.354 --> 52:24.343
What the fuck?

52:24.422 --> 52:27.823
Kid, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

52:32.864 --> 52:34.263
Jesus Christ!

52:34.332 --> 52:35.799
Let me see it!
Let me see it!

52:35.867 --> 52:37.164
What the hell happened to you?!

52:37.235 --> 52:40.466
I cut my hand by mistake!
Ow!

52:40.538 --> 52:43.098
- Of course it was by mistake.
- Ow!

52:43.174 --> 52:45.165
Here, hold still.
Hold still.

52:46.711 --> 52:48.906
I was just trying to help you!

52:48.980 --> 52:51.847
I forgot to say,
"It's gonna sting a little bit. "

52:51.916 --> 52:54.407
Shouldn't I wrap it
in a T-shirt or something?

52:54.485 --> 52:56.180
God damn it.

53:00.658 --> 53:03.559
Hey, kid?

53:04.729 --> 53:07.289
Kid, you okay up there?

53:07.365 --> 53:09.890
You need a Band-Aid
or something?

53:19.143 --> 53:21.236
Aw, shit.

53:30.054 --> 53:31.248
You're late.

53:38.229 --> 53:39.821
Kids.
Let me tell you.

53:43.334 --> 53:45.165
They run you ragged.

53:56.848 --> 53:59.043
Morning, team.

53:59.584 --> 54:00.676
Hey, hey, hey.

54:00.751 --> 54:03.015
It's not quite 8:00 yet.

54:04.021 --> 54:06.046
Well, how close are we?

54:10.561 --> 54:11.892
Now it's 8:00.

54:11.963 --> 54:13.055
Merry Christmas.

54:13.130 --> 54:15.098
Up your ass.

54:21.439 --> 54:22.804
God damn it!

54:22.874 --> 54:24.432
You tear your ball again?

54:24.509 --> 54:25.771
I don't think so.

54:25.843 --> 54:28.437
That's it.

54:44.962 --> 54:47.089
God damn it!

55:02.146 --> 55:04.171
Sweetheart,
don't romance 'em, now.

55:04.248 --> 55:05.909
Go on and get in there.
I can take it.

55:08.553 --> 55:09.451
Yeah.

55:09.520 --> 55:11.511
Gin, I got the info
on that Arizona plate.

55:11.589 --> 55:13.557
All right.
Now you're talking.

55:13.624 --> 55:15.649
Oh, hold on one minute.

55:15.726 --> 55:18.126
Baby, baby. Baby, baby.
Don't use that one.

55:18.195 --> 55:19.253
That's not the stuff.

55:19.330 --> 55:21.628
Use something
with some claws to it.

55:21.699 --> 55:24.099
Yeah, that hard candy.
That's it right there.

55:24.168 --> 55:27.433
Let me get some of that.
Yeah, that's it.

55:27.505 --> 55:28.836
Okay.

55:28.906 --> 55:29.838
Yeah, I'm back.

55:29.907 --> 55:31.340
The guy's Roger Merman.

55:31.409 --> 55:33.639
- Guess where he is.
- Give it to me.

55:33.711 --> 55:36.805
Ow! Damn it!
What's wrong with you, woman?

55:46.223 --> 55:47.815
Who are you?

55:47.892 --> 55:49.120
Your name Roger Merman?

55:49.193 --> 55:50.182
Yes. But...

55:50.261 --> 55:51.990
You doing three to six
for embezzlement?

55:52.063 --> 55:56.659
Uh, well, many accounting
questions are not cut-and-dried.

55:56.734 --> 55:59.168
Do you live at 41 Sage Terrace?

55:59.236 --> 56:01.204
Is it Grandma?

56:01.272 --> 56:02.466
Is my son all right?

56:02.540 --> 56:03.871
They're fine.

56:03.941 --> 56:06.239
Do you have any houseguests?

56:06.944 --> 56:08.070
Houseguests?

56:09.981 --> 56:12.472
Thank you for your time.
God bless.

56:13.150 --> 56:15.209
Well, hey, who are you?

56:17.488 --> 56:19.683
Houseguests?

56:22.760 --> 56:25.320
Little trick I learned
up at the North Pole.

56:25.396 --> 56:28.160
If you fry baloney,
it tastes like a hot dog.

56:28.232 --> 56:30.132
I thought you
didn't like sandwiches.

56:30.201 --> 56:32.135
Yeah, but this
is not a sandwich.

56:32.203 --> 56:33.761
A sandwich has
two pieces of bread

56:33.838 --> 56:35.669
with a bunch of junk on it.

56:36.907 --> 56:38.431
It's like a tostada.

56:38.509 --> 56:41.103
This isn't a tostada.

56:41.178 --> 56:42.509
There you go, Granny.

56:43.514 --> 56:45.846
Little salsa here.

56:46.917 --> 56:49.317
Now it's a tostada.

56:49.920 --> 56:51.683
Have you seen
my Advent calendar?

56:51.756 --> 56:54.156
What the fuck is it
with the Advent calendar?

56:54.225 --> 56:56.386
Why are you so obsessed
with that goddamn thing?

56:56.460 --> 56:58.451
The story sucks anyway.

57:02.533 --> 57:04.091
I think I saw it in the hallway.

57:04.168 --> 57:05.897
- Really?
- I think so.

57:14.679 --> 57:17.443
Looks like someone messed
with my Advent calendar.

57:17.515 --> 57:20.075
What are you talking about?
Let me see.

57:21.318 --> 57:23.684
Nobody messed with it.
It looks fine.

57:38.335 --> 57:41.099
There's a candy corn
in this one.

57:41.172 --> 57:43.800
Well, they can't all be winners,
can they?

57:48.746 --> 57:51.715
Well, it's fucked.

57:51.782 --> 57:53.181
Yeah?

57:53.250 --> 57:54.877
Yeah.

57:54.952 --> 57:56.647
- Fucked, frankly.
- He's...

57:56.721 --> 57:58.313
- Clean...
- Oh.

57:58.389 --> 58:00.084
- As a fucking whistle.
- Nothing?

58:00.157 --> 58:01.454
- No.
- Oh.

58:01.525 --> 58:03.459
- Nothing. I mean shit.
- Yeah.

58:03.527 --> 58:04.789
- He curses.
- Yeah?

58:04.862 --> 58:06.659
- But never around children.
- Oh.

58:06.731 --> 58:08.164
- No criminal record.
- Yeah.

58:08.232 --> 58:10.826
- No parking tickets.
- Nothing.

58:10.901 --> 58:12.994
- No bad habits, even.
- Oh.

58:13.070 --> 58:14.367
Sex, yeah.

58:14.438 --> 58:17.100
- But man is a sexual being.
- Yeah.

58:17.174 --> 58:18.971
- Fuckin' Darwinian.
- Oh.

58:19.043 --> 58:21.102
- You can't do shit about that.
- No.

58:21.178 --> 58:22.873
Hell, I wouldn't want to.

58:25.850 --> 58:29.342
No, of course not.
I'm not advocating celibacy.

58:29.420 --> 58:32.184
Hope not. It'd be the end
of the fucking human race.

58:32.256 --> 58:34.019
Yeah.

58:34.091 --> 58:35.752
Fucks large women.

58:36.627 --> 58:38.288
What can I say?

58:51.308 --> 58:53.799
Hey, look,
it's the retard again.

59:04.655 --> 59:05.622
Wedgie.

59:05.689 --> 59:07.350
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59:09.727 --> 59:11.194
Well, what the hell do you want?

59:11.262 --> 59:12.661
Pokémon!

59:12.730 --> 59:14.095
Done.

59:18.469 --> 59:21.700
You probably shouldn't
be digging in your ass.

59:22.940 --> 59:24.771
Santa...

59:26.343 --> 59:28.140
Oh, jeez.

59:31.482 --> 59:33.882
- Is that your underwear?
- Part of it.

59:33.951 --> 59:35.748
Where the hell's the rest of it?

59:35.820 --> 59:38.288
No, actually, don't tell me.
What do you want?

59:38.355 --> 59:41.916
I was thinking I wanted a purple
stuffed elephant, not pink.

59:41.992 --> 59:43.687
But now I changed my mind.

59:43.761 --> 59:46.696
- Yeah, what?
- Now I don't want an elephant.

59:46.764 --> 59:48.322
I want a gorilla named Davey

59:48.399 --> 59:51.266
for beating up the skateboard
kids who pull on my underwear.

59:51.335 --> 59:53.701
He could take his orders
from the talking walnut,

59:53.771 --> 59:56.205
so it wouldn't be my bad thing.

01:00:00.811 --> 01:00:02.039
Jesus, kid.

01:00:02.112 --> 01:00:04.376
When I was your age,
I didn't need no gorilla,

01:00:04.448 --> 01:00:06.416
and I wasn't as big
as one of your legs.

01:00:06.483 --> 01:00:08.883
Four kids beat me up
and I went crying to my daddy.

01:00:08.953 --> 01:00:10.818
- You know what he did?
- He made it all better?

01:00:10.888 --> 01:00:13.652
No, he kicked my ass.
You know why?

01:00:13.724 --> 01:00:16.625
'Cause you went to the bathroom
on Mommy's dishes?

01:00:16.694 --> 01:00:18.286
What the fuck?

01:00:18.362 --> 01:00:19.226
No.

01:00:19.296 --> 01:00:21.958
He tried to teach you
not to cry and be a man?

01:00:22.032 --> 01:00:26.196
No. It's because he was
a mean, drunk son of a bitch.

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:27.931
When he wasn't busting my ass,

01:00:28.005 --> 01:00:29.836
he was putting cigarettes out
on my neck.

01:00:29.907 --> 01:00:31.238
The world ain't fair.

01:00:31.308 --> 01:00:33.708
You gotta take what you need
when you can get it.

01:00:33.777 --> 01:00:36.473
Learn to stand up for yourself.
Quit being a pussy.

01:00:36.547 --> 01:00:39.209
Kick these kids
in the balls or something.

01:00:40.851 --> 01:00:42.409
Or don't.
Shit, I don't care.

01:00:42.486 --> 01:00:44.977
Just leave me out of it.
Now, get on out of here.

01:00:45.055 --> 01:00:47.580
Okay.
Thanks, Santa.

01:01:02.039 --> 01:01:04.507
Go get the next lucky boy
or girl, okay?

01:01:05.843 --> 01:01:07.606
All right, next.

01:01:09.446 --> 01:01:11.778
Open the ropes there, Marcus.

01:01:12.816 --> 01:01:14.010
I know you?

01:01:14.084 --> 01:01:15.108
Not yet.

01:01:17.321 --> 01:01:19.585
Seven cities in seven years.

01:01:19.657 --> 01:01:21.318
Pretty impressive.

01:01:21.392 --> 01:01:23.690
The store changes,
your name changes.

01:01:23.761 --> 01:01:26.229
But you always get away clean.

01:01:26.297 --> 01:01:27.559
Yeah.

01:01:27.631 --> 01:01:29.531
Pretty darn impressive.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.192
Well, let's face the facts.

01:01:31.268 --> 01:01:33.498
Y'all are a couple
of half-bucket small-timers.

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:36.801
You, because of your physical
attributes, found a niche,

01:01:36.874 --> 01:01:38.398
and I respect that.

01:01:38.475 --> 01:01:40.500
But you also been caught...

01:01:41.612 --> 01:01:42.738
...by me.

01:01:42.813 --> 01:01:45.646
So this is how it's gonna be.

01:01:45.716 --> 01:01:47.343
I don't want to take over.

01:01:47.418 --> 01:01:49.682
I don't even want to change
your scam.

01:01:49.753 --> 01:01:51.846
Whatever you guys do, it works.

01:01:51.922 --> 01:01:53.822
All I want is a taste.

01:01:53.891 --> 01:01:56.416
When the deed is done,
we part ways.

01:01:56.493 --> 01:01:58.324
I'll buy a little ranch
in Havasu,

01:01:58.395 --> 01:02:01.762
and you all take your little
medicine show back on the road.

01:02:04.401 --> 01:02:05.698
- How much?
- Half.

01:02:05.769 --> 01:02:08.067
No way! You don't know
who you're fucking with.

01:02:08.138 --> 01:02:11.301
Back off, Will.
I got this. I got this!

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:14.575
Okay. 30%.

01:02:14.645 --> 01:02:17.443
There's three of us.
30%. That's fair.

01:02:17.514 --> 01:02:19.209
Half.

01:02:19.283 --> 01:02:20.580
I meant 33%...

01:02:20.651 --> 01:02:21.515
I meant half.

01:02:21.585 --> 01:02:22.609
...and 1/3.

01:02:22.686 --> 01:02:24.176
Half.

01:02:25.489 --> 01:02:26.683
35%.

01:02:27.624 --> 01:02:28.352
Half.

01:02:28.425 --> 01:02:30.086
40%.

01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:32.694
Half.

01:02:34.732 --> 01:02:36.097
42%.

01:02:38.268 --> 01:02:39.633
Half.

01:02:44.608 --> 01:02:45.768
45%.

01:02:51.815 --> 01:02:53.407
Half.

01:02:54.518 --> 01:02:55.507
48%?

01:02:56.687 --> 01:02:58.746
Half.

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:00.514
49%.

01:03:00.591 --> 01:03:02.024
Half.

01:03:03.694 --> 01:03:05.559
Well, what's one point?

01:03:05.629 --> 01:03:07.563
We split the dough
right down the middle.

01:03:07.631 --> 01:03:10.099
Any merchandise you take, I get
to look at and cherry-pick.

01:03:10.167 --> 01:03:12.499
No! Money's one thing,
but you ain't gettin' the...

01:03:12.569 --> 01:03:15.003
This ain't no Chinese menu,
jagoff.

01:03:15.072 --> 01:03:17.632
I tell you how it's gonna be.

01:03:17.708 --> 01:03:20.074
This is pricks fix.

01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:26.607
Pricks fix?

01:03:26.683 --> 01:03:28.617
He's a fucking moron.

01:03:28.685 --> 01:03:29.583
Oh, really?

01:03:29.653 --> 01:03:31.450
Is that how you got
the upper hand?

01:03:31.522 --> 01:03:32.420
Fuck you.

01:03:32.489 --> 01:03:33.478
Negotiating?

01:03:33.557 --> 01:03:35.422
If you don't like,
next year, fuck off.

01:03:35.492 --> 01:03:37.255
I can always get
another box jockey.

01:03:37.327 --> 01:03:38.692
I can get another midget, too.

01:03:38.762 --> 01:03:39.990
Yeah, where?

01:03:40.064 --> 01:03:43.090
You see us hanging off of trees
like fucking crab apples?

01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:45.601
Even if we did, you'd never
front your own racket.

01:03:45.669 --> 01:03:48.001
You know why, Willie?
You got no discipline.

01:03:48.072 --> 01:03:51.405
You got zero fuckin' initiative.
You'd fall apart without me.

01:03:51.475 --> 01:03:53.102
You're too pathetic for words.

01:03:53.177 --> 01:03:55.941
You're a fucking loser,
and you fucking know it.

01:04:03.687 --> 01:04:06.247
<i>To go glidin'
in a one-horse sleigh</i>

01:04:06.323 --> 01:04:09.383
<i>Giddyup, jingle horse,
pick up your feet</i>

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.827
<i>Jingle around the clock</i>

01:04:12.896 --> 01:04:16.525
<i>Mix and mingle
in the jinglin' beat</i>

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.431
<i>That's the jingle bell rock</i>

01:04:18.502 --> 01:04:22.336
Santa'll be here real soon,
kids. Real soon.

01:04:22.406 --> 01:04:25.739
<i>Jingle bells chime
in jingle bell time</i>

01:04:25.809 --> 01:04:27.606
There he is.
Look.

01:04:27.678 --> 01:04:29.976
<i>In jingle bell square</i>

01:04:30.047 --> 01:04:32.572
Oh, no.

01:04:32.649 --> 01:04:36.050
<i>What a bright time,
it's the right time</i>

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.714
<i>To rock the night away</i>

01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:41.189
Oh, my God!

01:04:41.258 --> 01:04:43.226
<i>Is a swell time</i>

01:04:43.293 --> 01:04:46.387
<i>To go glidin'
in a one-horse sleigh</i>

01:04:46.463 --> 01:04:49.626
<i>Giddyup, jingle horse,
pick up your feet</i>

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.828
<i>Jingle around the clock</i>

01:04:52.903 --> 01:04:56.703
<i>Mix and mingle
in the jinglin' beat...</i>

01:05:09.887 --> 01:05:11.878
Sweet Jews for Jesus.

01:05:11.955 --> 01:05:13.980
I pissed myself.

01:05:14.057 --> 01:05:15.752
What the fuck
do you think you doing?

01:05:15.826 --> 01:05:17.657
You son of a bitch!

01:05:17.728 --> 01:05:18.888
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

01:05:18.962 --> 01:05:20.327
Hey, come on, come on.

01:05:20.397 --> 01:05:22.024
Look, hey!
Come on, come on!

01:05:22.099 --> 01:05:24.033
Look here.
Get him out of here.

01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:25.728
I'll smooth things over
with Chipeska.

01:05:25.802 --> 01:05:28.566
- Tell him food poisoning.
- "Get him out of here"?

01:05:28.639 --> 01:05:29.970
Take him to the car.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:33.032
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm a motherfuckin' dwarf.

01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:35.101
So unless you got
a forklift handy,

01:05:35.179 --> 01:05:37.113
maybe you should
lend a hand, hmm?

01:05:37.181 --> 01:05:39.240
That figures. You want
all kind of set-asides.

01:05:39.316 --> 01:05:41.181
Special treatment
'cause you're handicapped.

01:05:41.251 --> 01:05:42.149
You all the same.

01:05:42.219 --> 01:05:43.311
Special treatment?

01:05:43.387 --> 01:05:45.719
I'm 3-foot-fucking-tall,
you asshole!

01:05:45.789 --> 01:05:47.381
It's a matter of physics.

01:05:47.457 --> 01:05:49.925
Draw me a sketch of how
I get him to the car, huh?

01:05:49.993 --> 01:05:51.756
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

01:05:51.828 --> 01:05:53.455
Sketch it up, you moron.

01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:56.090
Fucking Leonardo da Vinci.

01:05:57.367 --> 01:05:58.834
What you call me, thigh high?

01:05:58.902 --> 01:06:00.563
I called you
a fucking guinea homo

01:06:00.637 --> 01:06:02.969
from the 15th-fucking-century,
you dickhead!

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.133
I could stick you up my ass,
small fry.

01:06:05.209 --> 01:06:07.871
Yeah? You sure it ain't
too sore from last night?

01:06:07.945 --> 01:06:09.776
You got some lip on you, midget.

01:06:09.846 --> 01:06:12.679
Well, these lips were on
your wife's pussy last night.

01:06:12.749 --> 01:06:15.513
Why don't you dust that
thing off once in a while?

01:06:15.586 --> 01:06:17.144
Asshole.

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:22.922
I pissed my pants.

01:06:22.993 --> 01:06:24.324
Oh, shut up.

01:06:49.119 --> 01:06:51.019
Santa.

01:07:00.697 --> 01:07:02.324
Santa?

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.099
What?

01:07:06.403 --> 01:07:08.200
What are you doing?

01:07:09.573 --> 01:07:11.040
Nothing.

01:07:12.075 --> 01:07:14.043
You going to work today?

01:07:17.414 --> 01:07:19.279
Not really.

01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:22.079
You just gonna sit there?

01:07:24.221 --> 01:07:25.153
Yeah.

01:07:25.222 --> 01:07:27.918
Just let me alone, okay?

01:07:31.395 --> 01:07:33.363
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, kid?

01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:34.897
Yeah?

01:07:38.935 --> 01:07:40.800
I want you to take this letter.

01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:45.001
When the paramedics come
to bag Santa up,

01:07:45.075 --> 01:07:47.100
there's gonna be
some cops there.

01:07:47.177 --> 01:07:50.374
I want you to make sure that
those cops get that envelope.

01:07:50.447 --> 01:07:52.312
What is it?

01:07:52.382 --> 01:07:55.374
It just tells
all the bad things that...

01:07:57.788 --> 01:08:00.279
What the fuck happened
to your eye?

01:08:01.491 --> 01:08:02.924
Fucking little prick!

01:08:05.762 --> 01:08:08.526
So you like to give little kids
black eyes, huh?

01:08:11.034 --> 01:08:13.161
How 'bout you, huh?!
You want some?!

01:08:13.236 --> 01:08:15.830
Anybody else?
Anybody else? Come on!

01:08:15.906 --> 01:08:17.635
Yeah, there you go.

01:08:35.591 --> 01:08:38.220
You know, I think
I've turned a corner.

01:08:38.962 --> 01:08:42.398
Yeah?
You fucking petites now?

01:08:42.466 --> 01:08:44.832
No. I'm not talking about that.

01:08:46.937 --> 01:08:50.497
I beat the shit
out of some kids today.

01:08:50.573 --> 01:08:52.837
But it was for a purpose.

01:08:55.212 --> 01:08:57.805
It made me feel good
about myself.

01:08:59.448 --> 01:09:02.009
It was like I did something
constructive with my life.

01:09:02.085 --> 01:09:03.848
I don't know.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.252
Like I accomplished something.

01:09:09.626 --> 01:09:12.493
You need many years of therapy.

01:09:12.562 --> 01:09:16.622
Many, many, many
fuckin' years of therapy.

01:09:17.401 --> 01:09:19.961
Okay. You don't drink,
which is smart on your part.

01:09:20.036 --> 01:09:22.129
But being sober can put you
at a disadvantage

01:09:22.205 --> 01:09:23.671
when it comes to violence.

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.901
I can't box worth a shit, see.

01:09:25.975 --> 01:09:29.810
But I'm good in a fight
because I can't feel anything.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.404
You, you're gonna feel
everything.

01:09:33.683 --> 01:09:35.149
Okay.

01:09:35.218 --> 01:09:38.915
Now put your dukes up.
Let me see what you got.

01:09:38.988 --> 01:09:40.013
This is bullshit!

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:43.423
Give me one good reason why I
should even consider doing this.

01:09:43.493 --> 01:09:46.018
'Cause I let 2,000 kids
spit in my face for your ass.

01:09:46.095 --> 01:09:47.154
That's why.

01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:48.993
Now, I'm asking you
for this one thing.

01:09:49.064 --> 01:09:50.760
Come on, look at the kid.

01:09:52.202 --> 01:09:53.464
He is pathetic.

01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:55.129
Yeah, he's just a little...

01:09:55.205 --> 01:09:57.366
He's a fucking retard.

01:09:58.575 --> 01:10:00.702
Yeah, let's show him
a couple of things

01:10:00.777 --> 01:10:02.108
so he can defend himself, then.

01:10:02.179 --> 01:10:03.806
Unless you're scared.

01:10:05.248 --> 01:10:07.045
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

01:10:07.117 --> 01:10:08.516
Marcus is a bully, right?

01:10:08.585 --> 01:10:10.553
He's gonna pull your underwear
up out of your pants.

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.848
Now, what do you do?

01:10:11.922 --> 01:10:12.980
I don't know.

01:10:13.056 --> 01:10:14.318
God damn it!
You don't know?

01:10:14.391 --> 01:10:17.724
If somebody wants to pull your
underwear up out of your pants,

01:10:17.794 --> 01:10:18.988
you have to get mad.

01:10:19.062 --> 01:10:21.189
Yeah, kid, come on.
Get mad.

01:10:21.264 --> 01:10:22.663
Scream at him.

01:10:24.901 --> 01:10:25.890
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:10:25.969 --> 01:10:28.301
Listen at him.
He's a fucking faggot.

01:10:29.206 --> 01:10:30.639
Loud! Scream!

01:10:30.707 --> 01:10:32.641
Be loud! Be mean!

01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:33.903
Piss him off!
Come on!

01:10:33.977 --> 01:10:35.205
Aah!

01:10:40.617 --> 01:10:43.745
You don't
hit people in the balls,

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:44.980
you asshole!

01:10:45.055 --> 01:10:47.023
Aah!

01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:49.422
What the fuck's wrong with you?
He's just a kid.

01:10:49.493 --> 01:10:51.393
- Fuck you, Willie!
- Ow!

01:10:52.128 --> 01:10:53.891
God damn it.

01:10:53.964 --> 01:10:55.625
I told you
I didn't want to do this!

01:10:55.699 --> 01:10:57.667
Making me...
Ohh!

01:10:59.202 --> 01:11:01.102
Oh, shit.

01:11:03.607 --> 01:11:06.974
Kid, maybe you shouldn't spend
so much time around me.

01:11:08.345 --> 01:11:10.506
You sneaky little prick.

01:11:11.715 --> 01:11:14.183
Fuck you!
Little bastard!

01:11:14.251 --> 01:11:15.582
Get off me!

01:11:22.826 --> 01:11:26.091
Shut up. That's not even
what you said.

01:11:26.162 --> 01:11:27.925
Oh, God damn it,
I forgot about that.

01:11:27.998 --> 01:11:30.626
We got a fucking nursing home
around here.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.827
Well, we can go in another room.

01:11:37.841 --> 01:11:40.275
She does look kind of still,
doesn't she?

01:11:43.213 --> 01:11:44.737
Hey, Granny?

01:11:47.684 --> 01:11:49.447
Hey, Granny.

01:11:55.225 --> 01:11:57.489
Hey, there, Granny?

01:11:57.561 --> 01:11:59.256
Oh, Granny.

01:12:01.531 --> 01:12:02.498
Oh, my God.

01:12:02.566 --> 01:12:04.090
What the fuck?

01:12:06.603 --> 01:12:07.797
Oh, shit.

01:12:11.341 --> 01:12:12.569
- Roger!
- God!

01:12:12.642 --> 01:12:15.236
- God damn it! Shit!
- You're home.

01:12:15.312 --> 01:12:18.907
- Please just tap me.
- Let me fix some sandwiches.

01:12:54.484 --> 01:12:55.678
Hello, little boy.

01:12:55.752 --> 01:12:57.310
Hello.
Santa...

01:12:57.387 --> 01:13:00.117
I know that Christmas Eve
is in a couple days,

01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:01.748
and you have to fly around
the world

01:13:01.825 --> 01:13:05.989
and give presents to everyone,
and you won't be around anymore.

01:13:06.062 --> 01:13:06.994
Yeah?

01:13:07.063 --> 01:13:09.588
So I thought I'd give you
your present now.

01:13:16.473 --> 01:13:17.565
What the fuck is it?

01:13:17.641 --> 01:13:19.506
It's a wooden pickle.

01:13:21.044 --> 01:13:23.569
- Why'd you paint it brown?
- It's not paint.

01:13:23.647 --> 01:13:27.048
It's blood from when I cut
my hand making it for you.

01:13:28.652 --> 01:13:29.880
Oh.

01:13:29.953 --> 01:13:32.285
Well, shit, kid, I don't know.

01:13:32.355 --> 01:13:34.016
I...

01:13:35.492 --> 01:13:37.551
Thanks.

01:13:37.627 --> 01:13:39.492
You're welcome.

01:13:39.562 --> 01:13:40.995
Good night, Santa.

01:13:42.732 --> 01:13:45.895
Good night, Mrs. Santa's sister.

01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:48.535
Good night, sweetie.

01:13:51.007 --> 01:13:52.941
Oh, my God.

01:13:53.009 --> 01:13:54.442
That was so sweet.

01:13:54.511 --> 01:13:57.480
He's a really sweet kid,
isn't he?

01:13:57.547 --> 01:13:59.708
Yeah, I guess so.

01:14:02.519 --> 01:14:04.453
Come on, baby.

01:14:05.188 --> 01:14:06.746
Come here.

01:14:08.124 --> 01:14:09.614
What?

01:14:09.693 --> 01:14:11.888
Oh, nothing.
I'm all right.

01:14:15.732 --> 01:14:17.791
Just a little tired.

01:14:17.867 --> 01:14:19.698
Oh.

01:14:29.579 --> 01:14:30.773
Santa!

01:14:30.847 --> 01:14:33.042
God damn it!
Whoa! Shit!

01:14:33.116 --> 01:14:35.346
Want to see my report card?

01:14:35.418 --> 01:14:37.249
You scared the holy shit
out of me.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.582
Think I did good?

01:14:38.655 --> 01:14:41.715
How would I know? I haven't seen
the fuckin' thing yet.

01:14:46.696 --> 01:14:48.163
Who the fuck is Thurman?

01:14:48.231 --> 01:14:50.893
- Is your name Thurman?
- Yeah.

01:14:52.769 --> 01:14:54.134
Thurman Merman?

01:14:54.204 --> 01:14:55.762
Yeah.

01:14:57.407 --> 01:14:58.965
Jesus.

01:14:59.042 --> 01:15:00.805
So, you think I did good?

01:15:03.513 --> 01:15:06.949
What do you care
what I think, anyway?

01:15:07.016 --> 01:15:09.143
Hell, I guess you did better
than I did.

01:15:09.219 --> 01:15:11.585
I never got any B's.

01:15:11.654 --> 01:15:14.179
I thought maybe at least
since I did good in school,

01:15:14.257 --> 01:15:15.815
maybe you'd bring me a present.

01:15:15.892 --> 01:15:17.757
'Cause last year
and the year before that,

01:15:17.827 --> 01:15:19.954
you didn't bring me
any presents.

01:15:23.032 --> 01:15:25.364
Even though I'm a dipshit loser.

01:15:29.606 --> 01:15:31.767
Jesus fucking Christ, kid!

01:15:31.841 --> 01:15:34.901
Why do you talk about
yourself that way?!

01:15:34.978 --> 01:15:38.141
Let me give you some news.
I'm not Santa Claus, all right?

01:15:38.214 --> 01:15:40.705
Take a look at me.
Do I look like Santa Claus?

01:15:40.784 --> 01:15:43.252
As a matter of fact,
I'm living fucking proof

01:15:43.319 --> 01:15:45.549
that there's not a Santa Claus.

01:15:46.289 --> 01:15:48.450
I know there's no Santa.

01:15:48.525 --> 01:15:50.959
I just thought maybe you'd
want to give me a present

01:15:51.027 --> 01:15:52.722
'cause we're friends.

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:18.882
There he is.

01:16:18.955 --> 01:16:22.755
That lousy, leather-faced,
frog-eyed, motherfucker.

01:16:22.826 --> 01:16:25.124
- Good night, Gin.
- Good night.

01:16:57.227 --> 01:16:59.252
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.

01:16:59.329 --> 01:17:00.626
What is the problem now?

01:17:00.697 --> 01:17:02.392
I'm sorry.
The van stalled.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.761
Will you give us a jump, please?

01:17:05.835 --> 01:17:07.735
I'll be dipped in dog shit.

01:17:07.804 --> 01:17:09.863
Do I look like
an auto mechanic to you?

01:17:17.146 --> 01:17:19.114
I appreciate it.

01:17:21.718 --> 01:17:24.346
All right, small fry,
help yourself.

01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:30.050
I can't reach it.

01:17:30.126 --> 01:17:31.787
Jesus Christ, give me that.

01:17:31.861 --> 01:17:33.055
Thanks.

01:17:35.465 --> 01:17:36.432
All right, hit it.

01:18:07.230 --> 01:18:10.256
Oh, my.
What a terrible accident.

01:18:10.333 --> 01:18:11.459
Mm-mm-mmm.

01:18:11.534 --> 01:18:12.899
- Is he dead?
- No.

01:18:12.969 --> 01:18:15.335
But it looks like
you broke most of his ribs.

01:18:15.405 --> 01:18:20.035
I'd say maybe 50% of them,
or do you think 30%?

01:18:20.109 --> 01:18:21.838
I needed more
of a running start.

01:18:21.911 --> 01:18:24.175
I couldn't build up
enough speed.

01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:42.459
Merry Christmas Eve.

01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:46.029
Got you a little something.

01:18:46.102 --> 01:18:47.967
You shouldn't have.

01:18:48.037 --> 01:18:50.335
You should put that stuff
in the kitchen.

01:18:53.109 --> 01:18:55.407
God damn, you look good.

01:19:00.049 --> 01:19:02.745
Here you go.

01:19:04.153 --> 01:19:07.645
Little behind there, sweetie?

01:19:07.724 --> 01:19:10.022
We don't need any more
of this shit.

01:19:10.093 --> 01:19:14.120
"Christmas keeps us connected
to each other in peace.

01:19:14.197 --> 01:19:17.894
The angel is going to tell
everyone in the world. "

01:19:22.472 --> 01:19:23.700
Aspirin?

01:19:23.773 --> 01:19:26.003
<i>As in olden days</i>

01:19:26.075 --> 01:19:31.809
<i>Happy golden days of yore</i>

01:19:31.881 --> 01:19:36.011
<i>Faithful friends
who are dear to us</i>

01:19:36.085 --> 01:19:42.115
<i>Gather near to us once more</i>

01:19:42.191 --> 01:19:47.424
<i>Through the years,
we all will be together</i>

01:19:47.497 --> 01:19:51.957
<i>If the fates allow</i>

01:19:52.035 --> 01:20:00.875
<i>Until then, we'll have to
muddle through somehow</i>

01:20:00.943 --> 01:20:09.282
<i>So have yourself
a merry little Christmas now</i>

01:20:12.088 --> 01:20:17.720
<i>Through the years,
we all will be together</i>

01:20:17.794 --> 01:20:22.094
<i>If the fates allow</i>

01:20:22.165 --> 01:20:30.595
<i>Hang a shining star
upon the highest bough</i>

01:20:30.673 --> 01:20:34.234
<i>And have yourself</i>

01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:42.149
<i>A merry little Christmas</i>

01:20:42.218 --> 01:20:46.621
<i>Now</i>

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.159
Shit!

01:20:52.228 --> 01:20:53.855
Jesus.

01:20:56.399 --> 01:20:57.457
Santa?

01:20:59.502 --> 01:21:02.198
- What?
- I was gonna make sandwiches.

01:21:02.271 --> 01:21:04.899
I could make you one
before you leave.

01:21:07.276 --> 01:21:09.210
Listen, kid, I don't know.

01:21:09.278 --> 01:21:12.372
I got shit to do and everything.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.447
Okay, make me some sandwiches.

01:21:19.522 --> 01:21:21.649
I gotta go to the mall
and talk to somebody.

01:21:21.724 --> 01:21:22.782
I'll be back.

01:21:22.859 --> 01:21:23.655
For dinner?

01:21:23.726 --> 01:21:25.557
Yeah, that's what I said.
Yeah.

01:21:25.628 --> 01:21:27.721
How many sandwiches do you want?

01:21:28.631 --> 01:21:30.826
Uh, a bunch.

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:32.959
How much lettuce do you want?

01:21:35.605 --> 01:21:37.402
I don't know.
The usual amount.

01:21:37.473 --> 01:21:39.566
Whatever the hell people do.
Whatever you think.

01:21:39.642 --> 01:21:40.973
Okay.

01:21:59.362 --> 01:22:00.158
Have a very merry Christmas.

01:22:00.196 --> 01:22:01.925
- Merry Christmas.
- Good night.

01:22:01.998 --> 01:22:03.329
Merry Christmas.

01:22:03.399 --> 01:22:04.525
Good night.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.192
- Good night.
- Okay! Happy holiday!

01:22:06.269 --> 01:22:07.736
Attention, shoppers.

01:22:07.803 --> 01:22:10.135
The store will be closing
in five minutes.

01:22:10.206 --> 01:22:11.935
We wish you all
a merry Christmas,

01:22:12.008 --> 01:22:15.239
a happy Hanukkah,
and a joyous Kwanzaa.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.895
All right, hold it steady.

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:40.469
Oh, yeah, shit, let's do it.

01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:42.835
Oh, Christ.

01:22:47.977 --> 01:22:48.966
Merry Christmas.

01:22:50.513 --> 01:22:51.912
Good night.

01:22:53.182 --> 01:22:55.241
Merry Christmas, Willie.

01:22:55.318 --> 01:22:56.945
Up your ass.

01:23:23.779 --> 01:23:25.508
Aaaah!

01:23:28.484 --> 01:23:29.883
Whoa!

01:23:56.312 --> 01:23:57.745
Oh, shit.

01:23:59.015 --> 01:24:00.073
What?

01:24:04.186 --> 01:24:05.483
What?

01:24:05.554 --> 01:24:07.647
It's a Kitnerboy Redoubt.

01:24:07.723 --> 01:24:08.417
So?

01:24:08.491 --> 01:24:09.719
Remember Andy Pitz?

01:24:09.792 --> 01:24:11.089
Andy Pitzorella?
Yeah.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.320
No, Andy Ripitski.

01:24:12.395 --> 01:24:14.260
Andy Pitzorella
was Andy Blue Balls.

01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:16.560
Since he got married,
they call him Andy Pitzorella.

01:24:16.632 --> 01:24:18.395
What's your fucking point?!

01:24:18.467 --> 01:24:20.162
They say he can get
into anything.

01:24:20.236 --> 01:24:22.170
Anything.

01:24:22.238 --> 01:24:24.536
They say he's been
in Margaret Thatcher's pussy.

01:24:24.607 --> 01:24:25.972
<i>And that's a good thing?</i>

01:24:26.042 --> 01:24:27.703
So what the fuck
are you getting at?

01:24:27.777 --> 01:24:29.267
When I was
in the joint with him,

01:24:29.345 --> 01:24:33.008
he told me that the Kitnerboy
Redoubt can't be cracked.

01:24:33.082 --> 01:24:35.915
Are you shittin' me?

01:24:35.985 --> 01:24:38.476
Are you telling me
that after I propped you up,

01:24:38.554 --> 01:24:41.250
held you together,
smiled for all those kids,

01:24:41.324 --> 01:24:43.519
danced for all those
fucking housewives

01:24:43.592 --> 01:24:46.823
in a fucking lime-green,
fucking velvet elf costume,

01:24:46.896 --> 01:24:49.023
that you cannot
get in this fucking safe?!

01:24:49.098 --> 01:24:51.794
Is that what you're
telling me?! Huh?!

01:24:51.867 --> 01:24:55.633
No, I'm just saying
it's gonna take a minute.

01:25:19.028 --> 01:25:20.620
Fuck.

01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:31.964
Shit.

01:25:32.041 --> 01:25:33.736
34C.

01:26:18.354 --> 01:26:19.514
Fuck!

01:26:52.555 --> 01:26:54.216
Piece of cake.

01:26:55.891 --> 01:26:58.621
I gotta get one more thing.
I'll be right back.

01:27:21.851 --> 01:27:24.183
Oh, shit.
Which one did he say?

01:27:42.805 --> 01:27:45.603
I'll bet the store dick
don't want this.

01:27:45.674 --> 01:27:48.040
Store dick don't want shit.

01:27:50.546 --> 01:27:52.514
What do you mean?

01:27:52.581 --> 01:27:54.446
Store dick's dead.

01:27:54.517 --> 01:27:56.985
Store dick don't want shit.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.151
He's dead, huh?

01:28:02.591 --> 01:28:04.855
I didn't even know he was sick.

01:28:04.927 --> 01:28:06.451
Willie...

01:28:06.529 --> 01:28:08.997
this has been
a long time coming.

01:28:09.064 --> 01:28:13.000
Every year, you're worse.
Every year, less reliable.

01:28:13.068 --> 01:28:15.468
More booze.
More bullshit.

01:28:15.538 --> 01:28:17.005
More buttfucking.

01:28:17.072 --> 01:28:20.405
Sure, the three B's.

01:28:20.476 --> 01:28:23.070
You gotta be able to rely,
Willie.

01:28:25.748 --> 01:28:28.239
You people are monsters.

01:28:28.317 --> 01:28:30.649
There's no joy in this for me.

01:28:34.156 --> 01:28:36.351
I'm not talking about
you taking me out.

01:28:36.425 --> 01:28:38.325
That part, I get.

01:28:41.964 --> 01:28:43.795
But look at all that shit.

01:28:46.168 --> 01:28:49.137
Do you really need
all that shit?

01:28:50.806 --> 01:28:52.933
For Christ sakes,
it's Christmas.

01:28:53.008 --> 01:28:54.669
It is Christmas, Willie.

01:28:54.743 --> 01:28:56.301
But this is what we do.

01:28:56.378 --> 01:28:58.608
We get the shit.

01:28:58.681 --> 01:29:01.809
Christmastime, we get the shit.

01:29:01.884 --> 01:29:05.047
Because we are men and Lois.

01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:09.217
It is Christmas, Willie.

01:29:09.291 --> 01:29:11.350
And we are men and Lois.

01:29:12.861 --> 01:29:14.692
What you waiting for, honey?

01:29:14.763 --> 01:29:17.732
Come on, plug him.

01:29:21.637 --> 01:29:23.537
Goodbye, Willie.

01:29:25.874 --> 01:29:27.398
- Drop the gun.
- Huh?!

01:29:28.711 --> 01:29:30.736
And you, Santa,
drop the elephant.

01:29:30.813 --> 01:29:32.713
- Where did you come from?
- Tipped off.

01:29:32.781 --> 01:29:34.476
Shit, that fucking kid.

01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:37.348
All three of you are in so much
shit, it's almost unbelievable.

01:29:38.787 --> 01:29:40.652
Marcus, hop on!

01:30:00.876 --> 01:30:02.969
Fuck me.

01:30:37.212 --> 01:30:38.372
Hey, hey!

01:30:59.568 --> 01:31:03.026
This is Christmas, and the kid's
getting his fucking present.

01:31:26.929 --> 01:31:29.625
Halt, police!
Put your hands up!

01:31:29.698 --> 01:31:32.292
I said freeze!
Freeze!

01:31:38.874 --> 01:31:42.674
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

01:32:25.954 --> 01:32:27.888
<i>"Dear kid...</i>

01:32:27.956 --> 01:32:29.685
<i>I hope that you got my present</i>

01:32:29.758 --> 01:32:32.056
<i>and that there wasn't
too much blood on it,</i>

01:32:32.127 --> 01:32:34.527
<i>although there was blood
on the present you gave me,</i>

01:32:34.596 --> 01:32:36.359
<i>which didn't keep me
from enjoying it.</i>

01:32:36.431 --> 01:32:39.491
<i>So maybe the blood doesn't
matter so much, I guess. "</i>

01:32:41.737 --> 01:32:44.831
<i>"Anyway, just in case
they took it as evidence,</i>

01:32:44.907 --> 01:32:47.239
<i>I'm also sending you a T-shirt.</i>

01:32:47.309 --> 01:32:49.800
<i>I hope it's the right size. "</i>

01:32:50.445 --> 01:32:51.844
<i>"I'm healing up good,</i>

01:32:51.914 --> 01:32:54.678
<i>and they tell me
that I will soon be 100%,</i>

01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:56.615
<i>even with 8 bullets
dug out of me,</i>

01:32:56.685 --> 01:32:58.710
<i>because they didn't hit
any vital organs,</i>

01:32:58.787 --> 01:33:01.449
<i>just my liver,
which is fucked anyway.</i>

01:33:01.523 --> 01:33:03.184
<i>Ha ha ha.</i>

01:33:03.258 --> 01:33:05.453
<i>Thank you for giving
that letter to the cops.</i>

01:33:05.527 --> 01:33:08.291
<i>I forgot I asked you to do it,
but it's a good thing you did</i>

01:33:08.363 --> 01:33:10.797
<i>or Santa's little helper
would've plugged his ass.</i>

01:33:10.866 --> 01:33:12.163
<i>Now the cops know I wrote it,</i>

01:33:12.234 --> 01:33:14.202
<i>which is gonna keep my ass
out of jail.</i>

01:33:14.269 --> 01:33:15.759
<i>That, plus everyone agreeing</i>

01:33:15.838 --> 01:33:18.363
<i>that the Phoenix police
shooting an unarmed Santa</i>

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:21.000
<i>was even more fucked up
than Rodney King. "</i>

01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:24.308
<i>"The cops are treating me
like fucking royalty now,</i>

01:33:24.379 --> 01:33:25.937
<i>which is new in my experience.</i>

01:33:26.014 --> 01:33:28.005
<i>They're gonna make me
a sensitivity counselor</i>

01:33:28.083 --> 01:33:29.448
<i>so that tragedies like this</i>

01:33:29.518 --> 01:33:32.385
<i>will never again embarrass
the whole fucking department.</i>

01:33:32.454 --> 01:33:35.480
<i>I told the cops you had no one
to take the fuck care of you,</i>

01:33:35.557 --> 01:33:37.752
<i>so they set it up
with Mrs. Santa's sister</i>

01:33:37.826 --> 01:33:39.316
<i>watching you
till your dad gets back</i>

01:33:39.394 --> 01:33:40.827
<i>in one year and three months.</i>

01:33:40.896 --> 01:33:43.831
<i>They made her a guardian
pro tem or some such shit.</i>

01:33:43.899 --> 01:33:47.130
<i>Anyway, she seems to like you
and your house and Jacuzzi.</i>

01:33:47.202 --> 01:33:48.430
<i>I sent her some money,</i>

01:33:48.503 --> 01:33:49.902
<i>so if you play
your cards right,</i>

01:33:49.972 --> 01:33:53.135
<i>you can probably get her
to buy you something.</i>

01:33:53.208 --> 01:33:55.642
<i>As for my little helper,
I'm sorry to have to tell you</i>

01:33:55.711 --> 01:33:57.906
<i>that him and his
prune-faced, mail-order wife</i>

01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:00.244
<i>are gonna be exploring
mountains with your dad.</i>

01:34:00.315 --> 01:34:02.613
<i>I hope your dad doesn't go
sucking shit from them</i>

01:34:02.684 --> 01:34:03.912
<i>like I did.</i>

01:34:03.986 --> 01:34:06.750
<i>They're supposed to let me
out of this hospital room soon,</i>

01:34:06.822 --> 01:34:08.915
<i>so get some sandwiches ready.</i>

01:34:08.991 --> 01:34:12.085
<i>Until then, don't take
no shit from nobody,</i>

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.752
<i>least of all yourself.</i>

01:34:13.829 --> 01:34:15.888
<i>Ho ho ho.</i>

01:34:15.964 --> 01:34:18.728
<i>Your pal, Santa. "</i>

01:34:21.703 --> 01:34:22.829
Hey, loser.

01:34:24.506 --> 01:34:27.873
I hear your buddy's not here
to protect you anymore.

01:34:29.544 --> 01:34:31.774
See you got me a new bike.

01:34:31.847 --> 01:34:33.610
Thanks a lot.

01:34:34.283 --> 01:34:36.012
I'm talking to you, fat-ass!

01:34:36.084 --> 01:34:37.813
Aaah!

01:36:54.456 --> 01:36:57.050
<i>And it wouldn't be Christmas

01:36:57.125 --> 01:36:59.423

<i>It's Christmas,
and I'm all alone</i>

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:20.339
<i>But it won't bring me down</i>

01:37:20.415 --> 01:37:25.011
<i>'Cause Christmas cheer

<i>Christmas</i>

01:38:28.183 --> 01:38:30.174
<i>I'm watching it fall</i>

01:38:30.252 --> 01:38:31.241
<i>Christmas</i>

01:38:31.319 --> 01:38:33.514
<i>Watching the people around</i>

01:38:33.588 --> 01:38:34.555
<i>Christmas</i>

01:38:34.623 --> 01:38:37.217
<i>Baby, please come home</i>

<i>They're singing
"Deck the Halls"</i>

<i>But it's not like
Christmas at all</i>

01:38:44.199 --> 01:38:47.430
<i>I remember
when you were here</i>

01:38:47.502 --> 01:38:50.562
