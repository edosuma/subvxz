WEBVTT

00:06.896 --> 00:08.955
This is Willie, our secret weapon.

00:08.998 --> 00:13.526
"He's got a ringer! Probably some big,
6'5" guy from another island.

00:13.568 --> 00:17.266
My buddy's coaching the other team,
wants to know what we're planning.

00:17.306 --> 00:21.299
- That's why we're being followed.
- Your coach is trying to use you.

00:22.311 --> 00:25.803
I want to know who you are,
other than Willie the Weapon.

00:25.848 --> 00:28.248
I don't need you or your crummy game.

01:39.522 --> 01:41.888
Aagh!

01:45.995 --> 01:48.225
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

01:48.264 --> 01:50.391
You came flying out on the street.

01:50.433 --> 01:52.162
Is she all right? Is she bleeding?

01:52.201 --> 01:54.362
No, she's OK, Gloria. She's OK.

01:54.403 --> 01:57.839
Kid, are you OK?
I didn't see you, I swear to God.

01:58.674 --> 02:00.505
She's hurt, Ernie! I knew it!

02:00.543 --> 02:03.637
Gloria, would you shut up?
Where are you hurt, kid?

02:03.679 --> 02:06.648
- It's my leg.
- It's her leg. Oh, God.

02:06.682 --> 02:07.876
It's not broken.

02:07.917 --> 02:09.907
My God, it's broken, Ernie!

02:11.621 --> 02:14.055
OK, maybe we shouldn't move you then.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.615
And let some other jerk run over me?

02:16.659 --> 02:18.889
Come on, help me up.

02:20.029 --> 02:22.793
OK, but take it easy. Nice and easy...

02:24.333 --> 02:26.267
Do you mind?

02:26.302 --> 02:29.430
Boy, I sure hope you got insurance.

02:30.540 --> 02:35.671
- Uh... no, the car's a rental.
- You see? I told you, get the insurance!

02:35.711 --> 02:37.838
Pay the extra and get the insurance.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.246
But would you listen to me? No.

02:40.283 --> 02:43.446
Where's a cop? We ought to get a cop.
And an ambulance.

02:43.486 --> 02:45.750
Wait a minute, kid.

02:45.788 --> 02:48.586
Maybe we can settle this, huh?

02:50.893 --> 02:53.191
What do you say?

03:18.921 --> 03:20.582
All right!

03:25.895 --> 03:28.022
All right!

03:32.034 --> 03:34.332
Hold it. Come on.

03:34.370 --> 03:36.395
Everybody up here. Everybody up here.

03:37.673 --> 03:40.972
When you go for the boards
I want you to get a good position.

03:41.010 --> 03:44.275
Let's work on some free throws.
Line it up. Line it up.

03:44.313 --> 03:47.009
You're looking weak. You're looking weak.

03:51.354 --> 03:53.083
All right!

03:53.122 --> 03:55.090
Straight up the pipe now.

03:57.093 --> 04:00.722
All right! Now let's get a streak
going here. One...

04:00.830 --> 04:05.790
Boy, these kids are great. I don't
believe it. Where did he get these kids?

04:05.835 --> 04:08.804
That's four in a row, Thomas.
These guys don't miss.

04:08.838 --> 04:10.738
- Did you see that?
- No.

04:10.773 --> 04:13.765
You know I can't watch.
T.C. and I made a deal.

04:13.809 --> 04:16.107
We don't watch each other's practices.

04:16.144 --> 04:19.444
It's just as well.
You wouldn't like what you see.

04:20.649 --> 04:24.051
Number 12 is hot city.
Thomas, you've got to see him.

04:24.086 --> 04:26.646
And number 15 is a giant!

04:31.460 --> 04:34.725
- What are you doing?
- A little of my own strategy.

04:34.764 --> 04:38.962
What makes you think we're gonna lose
by ten points? That's crazy.

04:39.835 --> 04:42.235
You're right. 15.

04:42.271 --> 04:46.173
- 15? Why?
- Because I've seen your guys play.

04:47.243 --> 04:51.179
Get the ball up.
Nobody touch the ground with the ball.

04:53.182 --> 04:57.016
Nice going. That's it. OK. Rebound.
Come on, get it back.

04:57.053 --> 04:59.419
Don't let the ball touch the ground, guys.

04:59.455 --> 05:02.390
No! Don't dribble!
You do that again, you take a lap.

05:02.425 --> 05:04.393
Get it back. Come on.

05:06.896 --> 05:09.296
Nice lay-up. Nice shot.

05:09.332 --> 05:12.267
Let's run some plays.
Shirts and skins. Come on.

05:12.301 --> 05:14.462
All right, let's go.

05:15.771 --> 05:19.901
We're gonna run the play where the high
post goes down, sets a pick for Gus.

05:19.942 --> 05:22.137
All right? In low post. Let's go.

05:27.983 --> 05:29.541
- You fouled me!
- You charged!

05:29.585 --> 05:31.780
You're just steamed cos I beat you.

05:31.821 --> 05:36.053
Hey, wait a minute, guys. Come on.
We're on the same team, remember?

05:36.092 --> 05:38.959
- Tell him this isn't football.
- Tell him to use his eyes.

05:38.994 --> 05:43.260
Knock it off! You're wasting valuable
practice time which we all could use.

05:43.299 --> 05:48.327
You're the ones playing next week,
not me. Let's run some plays.

05:48.371 --> 05:51.772
OK, let's set it up again. Hustle up.

05:51.807 --> 05:54.799
This time, Gus,
wait for that two-man pick to set up

05:54.844 --> 05:57.335
before you bring your man across.

06:00.850 --> 06:04.786
Gus, don't dribble! You give your man
time to pick the ball up, see?

06:08.624 --> 06:11.149
All right, girlie, give me the ball.

06:36.852 --> 06:39.343
OK, hotshot, give me the ball.

06:39.388 --> 06:41.618
Sure.

06:52.568 --> 06:53.967
Hey!

06:54.904 --> 06:57.304
Hey. Wait a minute.

06:58.641 --> 07:02.008
You better concentrate on defense.
You got no shooters.

07:02.044 --> 07:06.174
Your only hope is keeping the other guys
from scoring 100 points... a quarter.

07:06.215 --> 07:10.174
- Is that right?
- I know, I know, you didn't ask.

07:10.219 --> 07:12.449
So don't listen.

07:12.488 --> 07:15.116
I don't remember seeing you
around here.

07:15.157 --> 07:18.217
- I don't hang out with losers.
- We're not losers.

07:18.260 --> 07:21.423
The way those guys play,
you're gonna be.

07:21.464 --> 07:23.932
- What's your name?
- Willie.

07:23.966 --> 07:27.800
- Where did you learn to play?
- Ever heard of Bill Walton?

07:29.138 --> 07:32.073
- Walton, huh? You related?
- Mm-hm.

07:32.107 --> 07:36.305
- You live around here?
- Nah. We're just in town visiting.

07:36.345 --> 07:40.406
We're on the road a lot, you know.
Got a suite at the Kualao.

07:40.449 --> 07:43.009
Listen, if you're gonna be
in town for a while,

07:43.052 --> 07:46.385
maybe you'd like to play some ball.

07:46.422 --> 07:49.220
With those guys?
You gotta be kidding.

07:49.258 --> 07:52.625
No. My name's Thomas Magnum.
We're here every afternoon.

07:52.661 --> 07:56.028
- If you change your mind...
- I don't change my mind.

08:01.504 --> 08:05.941
Like I said, defense.
You better make it a zone two.

08:05.975 --> 08:08.068
They'll get killed playing man to man.

08:16.352 --> 08:20.789
Hey, guys. Listen up.

08:20.823 --> 08:23.257
We're gonna try something new.

08:23.292 --> 08:26.352
Who's ever heard of
a floating zone defense?

08:37.940 --> 08:42.433
I have reluctantly become accustomed
to your incessant door-slamming,

08:42.477 --> 08:46.437
and I have learned to turn a deaf ear
to your shouting like a fishmonger.

08:46.482 --> 08:49.747
But bouncing a basketball
on Mr. Masters' imported tile floor

08:49.785 --> 08:52.413
is something I cannot
and will not tolerate.

08:52.454 --> 08:54.445
Now please...

08:55.925 --> 08:57.552
stop.

08:57.593 --> 09:02.087
Sorry, Higgins. I just came by
to see if the uniforms had arrived.

09:09.171 --> 09:11.503
This morning.

09:11.540 --> 09:13.337
Did you have to pick red?

09:13.375 --> 09:15.935
I did not pick red.
Mr. Masters picked red.

09:15.978 --> 09:19.675
I abhor red.
I would have picked robin's egg blue.

09:19.715 --> 09:22.707
He felt that our team
should be appropriately outfitted.

09:22.751 --> 09:25.914
- But he specified red.
- "Our" team?

09:25.955 --> 09:29.948
Mr. Masters is sponsoring the boys
and will be following the game.

09:29.992 --> 09:31.960
As his representative,

09:31.994 --> 09:35.191
I will do everything possible
to assure our team's success.

09:35.230 --> 09:38.199
You? Higgins, I'm the coach, remember?

09:39.134 --> 09:43.002
Yes. Well, I've had a bit of experience
on the basketball court myself.

09:43.038 --> 09:45.302
You played?

09:45.341 --> 09:48.469
Yes. It was late '42. North Africa.

09:48.510 --> 09:51.377
The Allies were preparing to take Tripoli.

09:51.413 --> 09:55.816
But what with the heat, the awful food
and the malaria, the lads were demoralized.

09:55.851 --> 09:58.581
- Higgins...
- So I organized a diversion.

09:58.621 --> 10:01.419
Unfortunately,
cricket was out of the question.

10:01.457 --> 10:04.119
But we fashioned
a rudimentary basketball hoop.

10:04.159 --> 10:08.186
- Out of a peach crate, right?
- The lid of an old oil drum.

10:08.230 --> 10:11.495
As luck would have it, we had two
superb American players with us.

10:11.533 --> 10:17.438
Ernie "Set Shot" McElroy and a lad
from Kentucky, R. "Duke" Gilberry.

10:17.473 --> 10:20.033
- The R. "Duke" Gilberry?
- Quite.

10:20.075 --> 10:23.306
In a matter of days, I learned the game
and organized a British team.

10:23.345 --> 10:26.746
We called ourselves
the North African Anglos.

10:28.484 --> 10:33.717
By the time we marched into Tripoli,
we'd given the Yanks several floggings.

10:33.756 --> 10:35.087
What's that?

10:35.124 --> 10:38.491
That's an ingenious defense I created
while coaching the Anglos.

10:38.527 --> 10:41.189
I told you, I am the coach

10:41.230 --> 10:45.098
and I do not need an antiquated
World War 2 defense.

10:45.134 --> 10:49.036
According to Rick,
you need all the help you can get.

10:49.071 --> 10:54.475
I originally called this a sphere defense but
I believe it's now known as a floating zone.

10:54.510 --> 10:56.740
Are you familiar with it?

10:59.648 --> 11:03.778
<i>Higgins didn't know it,
but I wanted to win just as much as he did.</i>

11:03.819 --> 11:07.983
<i>Given the way the kids had been playing,
though, we were gonna need help.</i>

11:08.023 --> 11:12.221
<i>What we needed was a 13-year-old
tomboy with moves like Dr. J.</i>

11:12.261 --> 11:15.287
<i>And as luck would have it,
I just happened to know one.</i>

11:15.330 --> 11:17.855
<i>Of course, I had to find her first</i>.

11:54.002 --> 11:57.096
Come on, guys.
We've only got so much time.

11:57.139 --> 12:00.336
- Hey. Where are you going?
- Practice.

12:00.375 --> 12:04.038
Oh. It looks like I got here just in time.
Coach?

12:04.079 --> 12:07.571
Yeah? Watch your fingers, guys.

12:07.616 --> 12:10.449
I came by your hotel.
I couldn't find you or Bill.

12:11.153 --> 12:14.782
I know. We had to change hotels.
Too many reporters.

12:14.823 --> 12:17.417
Oh. Thought you didn't
hang around with losers.

12:17.459 --> 12:20.155
- I changed my mind.
- You don't change your mind.

12:20.195 --> 12:23.858
Let's not press this thing, OK?
I just want to play some ball.

12:23.899 --> 12:27.892
OK. Welcome aboard. We're gonna
go someplace else to practice.

12:27.936 --> 12:30.700
- Why?
- Spies.

12:52.521 --> 12:55.820
My buddy's coaching
the other team, wants to know our plans.

12:55.863 --> 12:57.831
That's why we're being followed.

13:00.968 --> 13:03.698
- You mean that guy in the pickup?
- Yeah.

13:04.839 --> 13:07.000
Either that or it's someone after you.

13:07.041 --> 13:09.134
- Me?
- Reporters?

13:09.176 --> 13:13.112
Oh. Yeah, right. Lose the sucker, huh?

13:13.147 --> 13:18.380
We don't have to. Where we're headed,
we're going to have absolute privacy.

13:19.420 --> 13:24.084
- Oh, my God!
- What is it, Higgins?

13:24.125 --> 13:27.686
Have you finally, irretrievably
lost control of your senses?

13:27.728 --> 13:31.357
Gee, Higgins. I don't think so. Why?

13:31.399 --> 13:36.564
Why? Why?
My God, man, your horde of... of...

13:36.604 --> 13:39.437
They're called kids, Higgins.

13:39.473 --> 13:42.340
OK, guys. Put the ladder away.
I'll get the balls.

13:42.376 --> 13:47.279
They could do more damage
than Sherman's men did in Georgia.

13:47.314 --> 13:54.550
T.C. is going to do everything he can to find
out our strategy, including hiring spies.

13:54.588 --> 13:58.149
I felt that it would be better
if we practiced out here, in private.

13:58.192 --> 14:03.459
At the estate? Every inch of these grounds
is a delicately balanced ecosystem.

14:03.497 --> 14:07.194
- The slightest disruption could destroy...
- Wait a minute.

14:07.234 --> 14:08.963
Hold it just a minute.

14:09.003 --> 14:12.439
It was you who gave me the
"Win one for the Gipper" speech, right?

14:12.473 --> 14:15.601
- I beg your pardon?
- And it was you who made it clear

14:15.643 --> 14:20.103
that you intended to do everything
possible to ensure victory, right?

14:20.147 --> 14:21.307
Right?

14:21.348 --> 14:23.782
Good. Me too.

14:23.818 --> 14:25.877
The tennis court will be perfect.

14:32.526 --> 14:36.121
Are any of you familiar
with the two-handed set shot?

14:39.300 --> 14:41.427
The underhand free throw?

14:46.240 --> 14:49.971
Hey, Magnum, this place
is totally awesome.

14:50.010 --> 14:52.638
- Thanks, Willie.
- How much did you pay for it?

14:52.680 --> 14:55.615
Magnum pay? What a novel concept.

14:55.649 --> 15:00.313
Young lady, not a single centimeter
of "this place", as you called it,

15:00.354 --> 15:02.447
belongs to Magnum.

15:02.490 --> 15:04.651
Who's this guy? Your butler?

15:06.260 --> 15:08.626
This is Higgins.
He kind of runs the place.

15:08.662 --> 15:11.028
Higgins, this is Willie, our secret weapon.

15:11.065 --> 15:13.363
Nice to meet you, Higgie.

15:14.668 --> 15:16.966
Come on, guys! Let's go!

15:26.480 --> 15:28.209
Nice play, guys. OK.

15:28.249 --> 15:32.015
Set it up again. Offense to defense.
There you go.

15:34.221 --> 15:35.916
Hey.

15:35.956 --> 15:40.052
Willie, why didn't you hit the open man?
He was wide open.

15:40.094 --> 15:42.324
He didn't look open to me.

15:42.363 --> 15:45.491
Well, he was,
and it's a screen-and-roll drill.

15:45.533 --> 15:49.333
Offense to defense. Let's go, you guys.

15:49.370 --> 15:50.962
Come on. Set it up.

15:56.377 --> 15:59.642
- Hiya.
- You didn't set a pick!

15:59.680 --> 16:02.547
You forgot to set your pick. Come on.
Offense to defense.

16:02.583 --> 16:05.051
You've got to set a pick
or the play won't work.

16:06.387 --> 16:08.719
Nice pick. Yeah, nice try, guys.

16:08.756 --> 16:11.316
OK. Good D. Offense to defense. Let's go.

16:12.126 --> 16:14.151
Come on, you guys.

16:18.866 --> 16:22.996
- What's wrong with you?
- That jade figurine is priceless.

16:23.037 --> 16:25.972
Yeah, I know. About two million priceless.

16:26.006 --> 16:29.464
2. 1, actually, but it's not a toy
to be played with, it's...

16:29.510 --> 16:33.037
It's Han Dynasty, right? About 220AD.

16:33.647 --> 16:36.810
A bit earlier, actually.
Between 170 and 185.

16:36.850 --> 16:41.082
Oh, yeah, right. I should have looked
more closely at the eyes.

16:41.121 --> 16:44.784
Quite perceptive. Now would you please
put it down? Very carefully.

16:44.825 --> 16:46.884
Sure, Higgie. No sweat.

16:51.599 --> 16:55.194
Wow! What a righteous chest!

16:55.236 --> 16:59.366
- That righteous chest is an antique.
- It's Korean, isn't it?

16:59.406 --> 17:01.897
I thought it was a Hong Kong imitation
at first.

17:01.942 --> 17:04.137
Nothing of Mr. Masters' is an imitation.

17:05.212 --> 17:08.375
Yeah, but this is the real thing.

17:08.415 --> 17:10.473
Tortoiseshell inlay and all.

17:11.318 --> 17:12.979
Yes.

17:16.757 --> 17:19.555
- It's a beautiful piece, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.

17:20.560 --> 17:26.796
- Hey, what smells so good?
- I'm baking a walnut torte for tea.

17:26.834 --> 17:30.292
- What kind of walnuts are you using?
- English, of course.

17:30.337 --> 17:34.671
- I hope you removed the skins.
- I beg your pardon?

17:34.708 --> 17:37.643
If you don't, they'll make it taste bitter.

17:38.612 --> 17:40.842
Yes, I have noticed a rather sharp tang.

17:41.949 --> 17:45.976
What you do is blanch them first,
then rub the skins off with a towel.

17:46.020 --> 17:49.478
- Where's the kitchen?
- Just off the dining room.

17:49.523 --> 17:51.616
Come on. I'll show you how.

17:51.659 --> 17:56.096
There's actually no such thing as
English walnuts. They're really Persian.

17:56.130 --> 17:59.930
People call them English cos British ships
brought them over from Persia.

17:59.967 --> 18:01.457
Interesting, huh?

18:01.502 --> 18:03.561
OK, offense to defense. Let's go.

18:05.572 --> 18:08.234
Hey, where's Willie?

18:08.275 --> 18:12.644
She was heading for the house.
I guess she had to... you know...

18:12.680 --> 18:15.911
You guys run some lay-ups, OK?
I'll be right back.

18:15.949 --> 18:18.349
<i>It was outside
the Abbey of Montecassino,</i>

18:18.385 --> 18:20.444
<i>and a bloody awful mess it was too</i>.

18:20.487 --> 18:24.423
Montecassino...
Early '44, right, north of Salerno.

18:24.458 --> 18:27.427
- Yes.
- You must have been a baby, Higgie.

18:27.461 --> 18:29.827
Well, ha-ha, not quite.

18:31.098 --> 18:34.465
At any rate,
Lieutenant Carlton Houghtailing and I

18:34.501 --> 18:37.299
were pinned down by sniper fire
for 16 days

18:37.338 --> 18:39.397
in an abandoned mushroom cellar.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.738
It's shocking what a deleterious effect

18:41.775 --> 18:44.266
a regimen of
nothing but mushrooms can have.

18:44.311 --> 18:47.644
By the sixth day, Houghtailing
had forgotten his own name,

18:47.681 --> 18:52.209
and by the tenth he was convinced that
we were Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.

18:52.252 --> 18:55.347
Needless to say,
that presented some problems.

18:55.422 --> 18:58.068
Higgins! Don't do anything you'll regret.

18:58.075 --> 19:00.737
What are you babbling about now,
Magnum?

19:02.680 --> 19:04.978
Nothing, I guess.

19:05.015 --> 19:08.883
If you abscond with Theresa
before we've skinned these walnuts,

19:08.919 --> 19:11.410
you'll forfeit your share of the torte.

19:16.527 --> 19:18.893
You gotta promise me something.

19:18.929 --> 19:21.864
- What?
- Well, my name, Theresa...

19:21.899 --> 19:26.302
It's sort of private.
I'd appreciate it if it didn't get around.

19:26.337 --> 19:27.599
Gotcha.

19:30.207 --> 19:33.938
Speaking of favors,
I've got one I want to ask you.

19:33.978 --> 19:36.538
Shoot.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.207
How about telling me the truth?

19:39.383 --> 19:41.943
About you.

19:41.986 --> 19:45.422
I already did, OK? I told you all about me.

19:45.456 --> 19:49.187
I'm not talking about phantom
basketball players and reporters.

19:49.226 --> 19:53.162
I want to know who you are,
other than Willie the Weapon.

19:53.197 --> 19:56.598
What about your mom and dad?
They living in Honolulu?

19:59.303 --> 20:04.206
You're just gonna wreck everything, asking
questions about things that don't matter

20:04.241 --> 20:08.837
and sticking your nose
into other people's business and...

20:08.879 --> 20:12.679
Great. Start to cry.
That's really gonna help a lot.

20:21.525 --> 20:25.393
My dad split town
about three or four years ago.

20:25.429 --> 20:27.056
Just didn't come home one night.

20:27.097 --> 20:30.157
My mom took it really hard.

20:30.201 --> 20:33.432
She cried a lot.

20:33.470 --> 20:38.305
Then one day she gathered together
all his stuff, everything he'd left behind,

20:38.342 --> 20:42.039
and made a bonfire out of it
in the backyard.

20:42.079 --> 20:44.809
The whole thing went up
in about 15 seconds.

20:46.550 --> 20:48.916
Easy come, easy go, I guess.

20:50.421 --> 20:53.948
Mom got a job doing secretarial stuff
for the government.

20:53.991 --> 20:57.256
You know, nine to five,
punch in and punch out.

20:57.995 --> 21:01.829
Me, I got a key to the apartment.

21:01.865 --> 21:04.527
I'm one of your latchkey kids.

21:04.568 --> 21:07.696
They write stories about kids like me,
don't they?

21:10.808 --> 21:13.276
It's up here on the right.

21:22.286 --> 21:24.151
You gonna be at practice tomorrow?

21:24.188 --> 21:27.749
I'm Willie the Weapon, remember?
I'll be there.

22:14.104 --> 22:17.471
You of all our children, princess.

22:17.508 --> 22:20.443
We're very hurt, and we were worried.

22:20.477 --> 22:22.911
We were very worried.

22:22.946 --> 22:25.813
Why, Lee looked everywhere for you,
didn't you, Lee?

22:25.849 --> 22:28.374
Yeah. Everywhere.

22:30.387 --> 22:33.379
Look, I was gonna call, for sure.

22:33.424 --> 22:35.415
Like hell she was.

22:36.427 --> 22:40.557
You raise a kid, you sweat, you slave,
and look at the thanks you get.

22:40.597 --> 22:44.829
Look, I'm not your kid,
I'm just another check from the state.

22:44.868 --> 22:48.133
Maybe you'd rather be back
in a juvenile facility.

22:48.172 --> 22:51.300
- That can be arranged, kiddo.
- Now, now, Vera.

22:51.342 --> 22:53.469
That won't be necessary.

22:53.510 --> 22:57.002
Kids. They never appreciate
what they've got.

22:58.248 --> 23:01.740
Home sweet home. Thanks. Tons.

23:02.286 --> 23:04.117
Be fair, princess.

23:04.154 --> 23:07.453
We invested a lot of time
in your... education.

23:07.491 --> 23:09.652
We taught you so much.

23:09.693 --> 23:13.220
Yeah. Bouncing off car fenders
has a lot of potential.

23:13.263 --> 23:15.959
- We're all you've got, Theresa.
- Willie!

23:15.999 --> 23:17.728
It's Willie to you, Vera.

23:18.736 --> 23:22.968
Vera's right. It can be an awful cold world
out there, Princess.

23:24.308 --> 23:26.503
Well, I got friends.

23:26.543 --> 23:30.070
Oh, that's right. Yeah, we heard that.

23:30.114 --> 23:32.082
One of them's Robin Masters.

23:34.651 --> 23:38.280
Is that true? Is that really true?

23:38.922 --> 23:42.756
Hey, Vera and I think that's terrific.

23:43.861 --> 23:48.161
I mean, it must be great to get to know
a guy like Robin Masters.

23:48.198 --> 23:51.167
Uh-uh. No way. Forget it.

23:51.201 --> 23:53.260
I got you guys clocked like radar.

23:53.303 --> 23:57.262
There's always juvie... princess.

23:57.908 --> 24:02.936
Yeah? Well, you guys can just kiss off
any schemes that you're thinking about.

24:02.980 --> 24:07.178
I'd rather come clean to the heat
than blow it with my friends.

24:07.217 --> 24:11.449
Princess, we're your friends.

24:11.488 --> 24:16.790
Besides, who in the hell
would believe you?

24:16.827 --> 24:18.658
Think about it.

24:24.535 --> 24:27.368
Now, princess.

24:27.404 --> 24:30.862
Maybe you can tell us a little something
about Robin's Nest.

24:32.075 --> 24:35.238
I've always been curious
about how the other half lived.

24:36.447 --> 24:38.415
Huh, Princess?

24:38.449 --> 24:39.939
Huh?

24:50.743 --> 24:51.787
See?

24:53.743 --> 24:56.337
- Still got the old spring.
- That's great, pal.

24:56.649 --> 25:00.278
- For my sake, I hope your kids do too.
- Huh?

25:00.319 --> 25:04.278
Since you've found your new secret
weapon, the points spread changed.

25:04.323 --> 25:06.484
I just cut Ice Pick in for five big ones.

25:06.526 --> 25:09.359
- Big ones?
- No, big ones.

25:14.650 --> 25:17.517
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Hold on.

25:17.553 --> 25:21.080
- What's the matter?
- Nothing that coming clean won't cure.

25:21.123 --> 25:24.092
- Do you know what he's talking about?
- No.

25:24.126 --> 25:25.957
I just came from the club

25:25.995 --> 25:29.260
and the odds on your team are
way down, almost even money.

25:29.298 --> 25:31.562
What gives?

25:34.904 --> 25:37.031
A ringer. He's got a ringer!

25:37.640 --> 25:41.167
"Probably some big,
6'5" guy from another island.

25:41.210 --> 25:45.306
He's probably mean and ugly too.
That is low down, Thomas.

25:45.348 --> 25:47.009
That is illegal, immoral...

25:47.049 --> 25:50.177
T.C., it is a kids' game, and that's all I got.

25:50.219 --> 25:54.952
Kids, just like yours. Maybe the word's out
on the quality of the coaching.

25:54.991 --> 25:58.119
The quality of the coaching? Hah!

25:58.160 --> 26:02.290
Man, talk is cheap. When was
the last time you played, anyway?

26:02.331 --> 26:06.233
Oh, the Academy,
that basketball powerhouse.

26:06.269 --> 26:08.999
With their height limit.
What were you, the center?

26:09.038 --> 26:13.407
- Kareem Abdul-Magnum.
- Don't go any farther.

26:13.442 --> 26:18.209
I know what you're going to say next. The
third all-time leading score at Grumbling?

26:18.247 --> 26:21.045
- Grambling!
- Oh, yeah.

26:21.918 --> 26:24.478
Wait! Hold on! Hold on!

26:25.454 --> 26:27.649
I think I've got an idea
that will settle everything.

26:32.061 --> 26:34.325
Where you move, boy?

26:34.363 --> 26:36.593
Let's do a little switch.

26:36.632 --> 26:39.328
Hold it, Magnum. Let me see that ball.

26:39.368 --> 26:40.767
Turkey!

26:42.538 --> 26:45.837
They don't teach 'em much
at the Academy, do they?

26:45.875 --> 26:47.866
Wanna touch this?

26:47.910 --> 26:50.071
Should have got on me.

27:29.919 --> 27:32.615
- Blocking.
- What? He ran right into me!

27:32.655 --> 27:35.749
- OK, charging.
- Charging? You gotta be out of your mind!

27:35.791 --> 27:39.283
OK! Play it over again.
Where's the ball?

27:48.804 --> 27:53.605
- So you're the star of this team, huh?
- Yeah, sort of.

27:53.643 --> 27:58.205
- This game must be pretty important.
- They all are.

27:59.949 --> 28:03.146
Look, I know what you're trying to do.

28:03.185 --> 28:05.346
You do?

28:05.388 --> 28:09.552
Hey, princess, I'm just
talking about basketball now.

28:10.793 --> 28:14.285
Sounds to me like this coach of yours
is trying to use you,

28:14.330 --> 28:16.992
to exploit your talents, you know?

28:17.033 --> 28:19.524
No, that's not it. Not at all.

28:19.568 --> 28:21.559
Oh.

28:21.604 --> 28:27.236
So after this game you figure they'll still
want to have you around, right?

28:27.276 --> 28:30.677
Well, sure. Of course. We're friends.

28:30.713 --> 28:32.977
Don't count on it, Willie.

28:33.015 --> 28:37.213
Vera and I and the other kids,
we're your friends.

28:37.253 --> 28:40.450
That's cos we've been through
a lot together,

28:40.489 --> 28:46.519
not all of it fun, but we've done what we've
had to do to survive and we always will.

28:46.562 --> 28:48.792
Cos we're a family.

28:48.831 --> 28:51.425
Those other people aren't.

28:51.467 --> 28:53.901
Give me a break, will you?

29:03.279 --> 29:06.112
She's probably just been
temporarily delayed.

29:06.148 --> 29:10.016
She's not coming. She lied to us,
just like she lied about everything else.

29:10.052 --> 29:13.078
- You're being awfully harsh.
- It's true!

29:13.122 --> 29:15.317
She lied about where she lives, her name.

29:15.357 --> 29:17.917
She probably hasn't said
one thing that's true.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.861
She's gotten to you
but I can still see what's going on.

29:20.896 --> 29:24.491
We're being taken for a ride,
being played for big, grown-up dummies.

29:24.533 --> 29:27.525
- But what on earth for?
- I don't know.

29:27.570 --> 29:31.631
I can't help but feel there's
a perfectly good explanation for all this.

29:31.674 --> 29:33.972
For once, Higgins, I hope you're right.

29:34.009 --> 29:38.742
Come on, guys, tighten up.
You're looking like a bunch of school kids.

29:52.995 --> 29:58.365
Princess. You know the way home.
We'll be waiting.

30:01.570 --> 30:06.064
OK. Chest passes. Let's go.
Fast. Let's go. Come on. Faster!

30:06.108 --> 30:08.804
Right in the chest. Keep it going. Faster.

30:08.844 --> 30:12.041
Don't put your hands at your side
when you're done. Faster.

30:12.081 --> 30:15.539
- That's it. Keep going.
- Hey, Coach. What's happening?

30:15.584 --> 30:18.144
OK. Rotate when you get to there.
Come on, guys.

30:21.290 --> 30:25.351
For starters, you're late.
About an hour and 15 minutes late.

30:25.394 --> 30:28.886
Yeah. I'm probably gonna be late
for my own funeral.

30:30.566 --> 30:32.761
Look, my mom's car wouldn't start.

30:32.802 --> 30:36.294
I had to find a jumper cable and
somebody who had a six-volt battery.

30:37.239 --> 30:39.969
Do you know how hard it is
to find a six-volt these days?

30:40.009 --> 30:43.911
Willie, if you can't tell me the truth,
don't bother saying anything.

30:44.547 --> 30:47.209
- What's that mean?
- We came by to pick you up.

30:47.249 --> 30:50.912
No one there ever even heard of you.
Why did you lie?

30:52.321 --> 30:55.415
All right, here we go again.
The third degree.

30:55.457 --> 30:57.550
- You a coach or a cop?
- I'm a coach.

30:57.593 --> 31:00.756
I won't have anybody on the team
who's not straight with me.

31:00.796 --> 31:03.230
What's any of that
got to do with basketball?

31:03.265 --> 31:07.065
It's a team sport, Willie.
All of us working together to win.

31:07.102 --> 31:11.801
Yeah, that's the most important thing
to you. Winning this stupid game.

31:11.841 --> 31:14.901
Impressing your friends.
Getting your name in the paper.

31:14.944 --> 31:17.242
- Winning your dumb bets.
- No, it's not.

31:17.279 --> 31:22.649
Sure it is. You're on a big ego trip,
telling everybody what to do.

31:22.685 --> 31:25.848
You don't care. You don't understand.

31:25.888 --> 31:30.086
I do care and I want to understand,
but you're not giving me a chance.

31:32.127 --> 31:36.621
OK, you want to talk? Really talk?

31:37.733 --> 31:40.668
- Come on.
- I'll talk right here.

31:41.804 --> 31:44.500
I don't have anything to hide.

31:46.876 --> 31:50.004
My name is
Theresa Catherine Henderson.

31:50.045 --> 31:52.309
Willie's my nickname, after my dad.

31:53.682 --> 31:57.846
He's dead and so is my mother.
Both of them died in a car accident.

31:58.988 --> 32:01.684
I live in a foster home, OK?

32:01.724 --> 32:03.521
It's not much, you know, our house.

32:04.226 --> 32:06.217
Maybe it's even kind of crummy.

32:06.262 --> 32:09.254
But that doesn't bother me.

32:09.298 --> 32:11.664
I don't have much, but I got me.

32:12.668 --> 32:16.160
And I don't need you or your team
or your crummy game.

32:16.205 --> 32:18.503
So try and win it by yourself.

32:30.619 --> 32:33.315
- I say, Magnum...
- Don't start with me, Higgins.

32:33.355 --> 32:37.018
I most certainly will,
after that petulant and insensitive display.

32:37.059 --> 32:39.084
Yeah, she was pretty impossible.

32:39.128 --> 32:41.995
- I'm talking about you.
- Me?

32:42.031 --> 32:44.192
Me? What did I do?

32:44.233 --> 32:48.795
You've allowed this game to become
more important than the children.

32:48.837 --> 32:53.001
After all Theresa's been through,
a bit of leniency might be in order.

33:02.851 --> 33:05.376
It's not gonna work, Higgins.

33:05.421 --> 33:08.083
I'm not gonna feel guilty.

33:21.570 --> 33:23.435
Hey!

33:25.441 --> 33:28.001
Hey.

33:33.282 --> 33:36.410
If I didn't like you so much,
I wouldn't bother with all this.

33:36.452 --> 33:37.714
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:37.753 --> 33:40.586
Then do me a favor.
Don't like me so much.

33:40.622 --> 33:44.251
- It's a real pain in the...
- All right! All right.

33:44.293 --> 33:47.592
Besides, you don't like me.
You don't even know me.

33:47.629 --> 33:49.824
It's just that I've got a great jumper.

33:49.865 --> 33:51.765
- And a terrific hook.
- True.

33:51.800 --> 33:54.234
And I drive the baseline
better than anybody.

33:54.269 --> 33:56.396
With either hand.

33:56.438 --> 34:02.035
Yep. If basketball was
all there is to life, you'd be set.

34:02.077 --> 34:04.341
I told you, I can take care of myself.

34:04.380 --> 34:06.575
Sure you can.

34:07.616 --> 34:10.608
You know, Higgins likes you too.

34:10.652 --> 34:13.018
He really chewed me out back there.

34:13.956 --> 34:15.650
Higgins got mad at you cos of me?

34:15.690 --> 34:20.754
Yeah. He was real steamed.
Said I was petulant and insensitive.

34:20.795 --> 34:22.821
He's got a point.

34:27.835 --> 34:31.362
He also said I was paying
too much attention to basketball.

34:31.407 --> 34:33.237
But he's wrong.

34:33.275 --> 34:38.235
It's not just the game, it's what you guys
learn from the game that's important.

34:41.850 --> 34:43.784
You believe me?

34:46.088 --> 34:48.420
I believe what you said about yourself.

34:48.456 --> 34:52.484
It's the truth. The only real home
I ever had was the library.

34:52.527 --> 34:55.895
Foster homes are just places
to go crash in after it closed.

34:55.931 --> 34:58.729
That's all I got. Books and basketball.

34:59.968 --> 35:02.903
Do you believe me?

35:09.211 --> 35:12.738
Hey, how about having dinner
with Higgins and me tonight?

35:12.781 --> 35:15.807
- How come?
- You figure it out.

35:15.851 --> 35:19.309
- Tonight?
- <i>Tonight?</i>

35:21.223 --> 35:23.817
What a thoughtful invitation.

35:23.859 --> 35:26.327
Yeah. Pot luck.

35:26.361 --> 35:31.025
This is gonna be a dinner
they're not gonna forget for a long time.

35:42.494 --> 35:47.032
There is something reassuring about the
sound of a child's footsteps in the home.

35:47.932 --> 35:50.560
I suppose it goes back
to my own childhood,

35:50.601 --> 35:52.569
Christmas in Cornwall,

35:52.603 --> 35:56.198
when the house
was absolutely filled with youngsters.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.936
My cousins, Alistair and Eunice.

36:01.545 --> 36:06.209
And an occasion such as this,
when we have a special guest,

36:06.250 --> 36:09.447
simply demands nothing but the finest.

36:09.487 --> 36:11.978
Don't you agree, Magnum?

36:12.022 --> 36:14.513
Yeah, except our special guest
isn't here yet.

36:14.558 --> 36:17.391
Theresa will show.

36:17.428 --> 36:19.692
I hope she's just fashionably late.

36:19.730 --> 36:23.029
A word with which I would hardly
expect you to be conversant.

36:23.067 --> 36:24.898
Fashionable, that is.

36:32.710 --> 36:37.511
- Yes?
- It's me, W... Theresa.

36:37.548 --> 36:40.608
- I hope I'm not too late.
- Of course not, my dear.

36:40.651 --> 36:43.279
I'll release the lock.

36:43.320 --> 36:45.754
Thanks.

36:46.991 --> 36:50.085
Thanks a lot.

36:50.127 --> 36:54.621
- What about those dogs?
- Higgins has them patrolling the beach.

36:54.665 --> 36:59.068
And they won't bother you
as long as I'm along. We're friends.

36:59.103 --> 37:03.403
You know something, Willie? I always
knew you'd amount to something.

37:03.441 --> 37:05.705
Yeah. Something.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.974
Hi, sports. Sorry I'm late.
Just pretend it's practice.

37:13.017 --> 37:16.418
- Hey. Nice-looking outfit.
- You look lovely, my dear.

37:16.454 --> 37:20.754
- Thank you. What's for dinner?
- We'll start with an artichoke vinaigrette...

37:20.791 --> 37:23.885
And if I'm not mistaken,
a Cornish game hen,

37:23.928 --> 37:28.922
with... apricot sauce
and seasoned with a touch of Pernod.

37:28.966 --> 37:31.230
Smells great. What's for dessert?

37:31.268 --> 37:35.204
If you'll be so kind as to accompany me
to the patio, you'll soon find out.

37:35.239 --> 37:37.264
Well, thank you.

38:06.837 --> 38:09.863
Wait. Isn't she a little young?

38:09.907 --> 38:12.705
Devigne knows no age limit. Half a glass.

38:12.743 --> 38:16.440
The game is tomorrow.
All I need is a hung over point guard.

38:18.415 --> 38:20.679
OK, half a glass.

38:22.219 --> 38:24.278
How about pouring me some?

38:24.321 --> 38:26.414
Really, Magnum, you must be joking.

38:26.457 --> 38:29.517
Waste a Devigne vintage '61
on your palate?

38:33.531 --> 38:36.659
Oh, well, I suppose
it is a special occasion.

38:40.704 --> 38:42.228
I'm a grown-up.

38:48.279 --> 38:50.042
Thank you.

38:53.450 --> 38:54.883
Friends.

38:54.919 --> 38:57.752
An admirable
though typically maudlin sentiment.

38:57.788 --> 39:03.624
However, it's inoffensive enough
in its generality, therefore... To friends.

39:08.532 --> 39:10.397
Theresa.

39:10.434 --> 39:13.130
Oh. Yeah. Sure.

39:13.170 --> 39:15.104
To friends.

39:25.849 --> 39:28.511
Couldn't we go upstairs?
Just to look around?

39:28.552 --> 39:31.020
Let's not push our luck.

39:39.029 --> 39:42.260
Something wrong with your vinaigrette?
Perhaps...

39:42.299 --> 39:45.097
Perhaps she'd rather have a taco.

39:45.135 --> 39:50.004
Or a chili dog. Come on.
You don't really like this stuff, do you?

39:50.040 --> 39:54.204
Of course she does. It was Theresa
herself who gave me the recipe.

39:54.244 --> 39:57.771
That doesn't mean she likes it, Higgins.
Right?

40:02.186 --> 40:08.489
You know, I've got a feeling there's
a lot of things that Willie doesn't like,

40:08.525 --> 40:13.895
except that sometimes
those things are just easier to do.

40:15.899 --> 40:20.336
But there is nothing easy
about eating artichoke vinaigrette.

40:21.271 --> 40:23.865
You're right. I can't stand the garbage.

40:23.907 --> 40:25.966
Let's blow this joint and get a taco.

40:30.748 --> 40:34.240
Except on the way out I think
we ought to stop by the living room.

40:47.731 --> 40:50.256
Hi, guys. Planning a garage sale?

40:51.201 --> 40:53.294
Princess.

40:53.337 --> 40:56.431
Don't give her that princess stuff.
I knew she was no good.

40:56.473 --> 40:58.566
Coming from you, that's a compliment.

40:59.343 --> 41:01.208
You little rat!

41:08.118 --> 41:10.552
Higgins, I am so sorry.

41:11.455 --> 41:14.356
Don't worry, my dear, it was a fake,

41:14.391 --> 41:18.987
a duplicate of negligible value,
as are all of the contents of those bags.

41:22.132 --> 41:24.032
You...

41:24.968 --> 41:27.596
You knew?

41:27.638 --> 41:30.471
- You guys knew?
- Of course we did.

41:31.141 --> 41:35.168
- But how?
- Well, I just did a little checking

41:35.212 --> 41:38.079
after I found out
who your foster parents were.

41:38.115 --> 41:41.881
- Then you didn't believe me.
- No, I believed you. That time.

41:41.919 --> 41:45.980
I just wanted to make sure
that they were OK for you.

41:46.023 --> 41:49.254
I also ran into that guy who followed us
in the pickup truck.

41:50.027 --> 41:51.551
Lee.

41:51.595 --> 41:55.622
Yeah, that's what he said his name was.
Said a lot of other things too.

41:57.501 --> 41:59.662
You guys knew all the time?

42:01.672 --> 42:04.106
And you trusted me?

42:04.875 --> 42:08.174
- You knew I wouldn't go through with it?
- Of course.

42:08.212 --> 42:11.113
We just wanted to make sure you did too.

42:25.729 --> 42:27.697
Somebody stop that girl!

42:29.500 --> 42:31.161
Come on, guys!

42:41.578 --> 42:44.046
Attagirl, Willie!

42:49.553 --> 42:51.987
All right! Come on, let's go!

42:52.022 --> 42:55.981
Let's go! Look at that!

43:18.415 --> 43:20.815
He got fouled and you called nothing!

43:23.086 --> 43:25.020
Come on, Willie, now work the ball.

43:25.055 --> 43:27.751
OK, set up now, guys.

43:29.960 --> 43:32.224
Time out. Time out.

43:32.262 --> 43:34.059
Come on, guys.

43:37.868 --> 43:40.598
- Don't do that again.
- What are you talking about?

43:40.637 --> 43:43.105
- I made that shot.
- That's not the point.

43:43.140 --> 43:45.665
Look for the open man under the basket.

43:45.709 --> 43:49.338
I don't want you gunning
any more low-percentage shots.

43:49.379 --> 43:51.643
That's the way to crash the boards, guys.

43:51.682 --> 43:54.082
This high post offense is working great.

43:54.117 --> 43:57.484
Make sure that you pick your man off
when you cross.

43:57.521 --> 44:00.354
When this person passes,
look for the back door.

44:00.390 --> 44:04.622
We'll run play number five.
If you get the ball, hold onto it.

44:04.661 --> 44:08.358
If she gets the ball,
double team her, triple team her.

44:08.398 --> 44:11.367
She will not pass
to other members of her team.

44:11.401 --> 44:14.564
OK. Menehunes, hey!

44:14.605 --> 44:17.699
Go get 'em, guys.
You can do it. Here we go.

44:17.741 --> 44:20.175
Now just work the ball.

44:20.210 --> 44:22.838
- What?
- Two to tie, four to win. Is she gonna do it?

44:22.880 --> 44:26.213
- There's a time and a place...
- Ice Pick has got money on the game.

44:26.250 --> 44:29.447
- Remember Ice Pick?
- I gotta coach. Will you stop it?

44:33.423 --> 44:35.220
Come on, guys. Defense.

44:38.896 --> 44:41.364
21 seconds.

45:18.802 --> 45:23.933
<i>Final score, Menehunes 38,
Robin's Stars, 36.</i>

45:27.711 --> 45:29.736
- Good game.
- Thanks, partner.

45:29.780 --> 45:32.180
You guys are awesome.

45:34.818 --> 45:38.982
- I'm sorry, Willie.
- It's not your fault, Gus.

45:39.022 --> 45:41.547
Hey. Nice pass, Willie.

45:41.591 --> 45:45.391
Gus, it was a good shot. A percentage
shot. You did the right thing.

45:45.429 --> 45:47.727
Next time it'll go in. Listen, guys...

45:47.764 --> 45:49.994
Hey, wait, let's give them a yell.

45:50.033 --> 45:51.694
Menehunes, rah, right?

45:51.735 --> 45:53.703
Menehunes, rah!

46:08.018 --> 46:09.542
Nice shot.

46:09.586 --> 46:11.315
We could have won.

46:12.889 --> 46:15.653
- Maybe.
- I shouldn't have listened to you.

46:15.692 --> 46:19.184
Yeah, but you did. And I'm proud of you.

46:19.229 --> 46:21.356
For what? Losing?

46:22.899 --> 46:24.867
Winning is not everything, Willie.

46:26.403 --> 46:30.999
Next you'll be saying it's not whether you
win or lose, but how you play the game.

46:31.041 --> 46:34.306
- How did you guess?
- Magnum, these are the 1980s.

46:34.344 --> 46:37.108
That went out with high-buttoned shoes.

46:39.249 --> 46:41.479
Well, maybe it shouldn't have.

46:41.518 --> 46:47.388
Maybe those trite expressions are there
because they have meaning.

46:51.528 --> 46:54.895
I mean, you sparked this team, Willie.

46:54.931 --> 46:57.058
You pulled them to within a basket

46:57.100 --> 47:01.230
of the toughest ballplayers
that I've seen for their age.

47:01.271 --> 47:07.039
Maybe we didn't win,
but you became part of the team.

47:07.544 --> 47:09.603
That's what's important.

47:10.313 --> 47:12.611
See, Willie...

47:12.649 --> 47:14.708
a team is like a family.

47:14.751 --> 47:17.185
Maybe you have squabbles,

47:17.220 --> 47:19.688
maybe you don't always agree
with each other,

47:19.723 --> 47:22.715
but you're still a family.

47:23.260 --> 47:26.127
Still friends. And that's what's important.

47:26.163 --> 47:28.461
I believe she got the point, Magnum.

47:29.733 --> 47:30.893
Although how she got it

47:30.934 --> 47:36.065
from that collection of antiquated saws
you were just quoting is beyond me.

47:36.840 --> 47:40.833
You know, you remind me
of Lieutenant Favisham.

47:40.877 --> 47:42.936
Frightfully verbose chap.

47:42.979 --> 47:47.609
Used to lecture us on the morals and
ethics of the British soldier on expedition.

47:48.585 --> 47:51.486
But one day we were surrounded
by Rommel's lads...

47:51.521 --> 47:54.456
and had no choice
but to fight our way out.
