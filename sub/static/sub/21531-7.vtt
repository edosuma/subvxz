WEBVTT

00:02.870 --> 00:04.638
Hey, did you read
the paper today?

00:04.738 --> 00:06.740
I stopped reading
the paper.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.509
Now, when people talk
about the news,

00:08.609 --> 00:10.010
I just shake my head and say,

00:10.111 --> 00:13.047
"I know, it's unbelievable."

00:14.115 --> 00:17.385
Suddenly, I'm informed.

00:17.485 --> 00:20.721
I do the same thing with,
"I know, that was some game."

00:22.090 --> 00:23.391
Yeah.

00:23.491 --> 00:26.660
Anyway, the Central Park zoo
has these two penguins

00:26.760 --> 00:29.063
that are apparently...gay.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.499
They're inseparable,

00:31.599 --> 00:34.268
they show no interest
in females during mating season.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.804
Though they are interested
in what females are wearing

00:36.904 --> 00:38.739
during Academy Awards season.

00:38.839 --> 00:42.110
That is so sweet.

00:42.210 --> 00:45.646
Thank God there's something gay
in this city I haven't dated.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.384
So did you hear the news?

00:50.484 --> 00:54.155
I know, it's unbelievable.

00:54.255 --> 00:57.191
I've decided I'm going
to move to a bigger place.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.260
You're kidding.
When'd you decide that?

00:59.360 --> 01:00.528
This morning.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.764
The ratings
for Jack Talk came in,

01:03.864 --> 01:06.134
and we got a 17 rating
and a 10 share.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.168
Wow.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.336
Yeah, in this case,

01:08.436 --> 01:10.104
that means
17 people watched,

01:10.204 --> 01:13.207
and 10 of them
were dressed as Cher.

01:13.307 --> 01:17.145
I just figured now that
I'm getting more successful,

01:17.245 --> 01:20.181
I need to live in a place
that feels successful.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.082
Good for you, Jack.
You should.

01:22.183 --> 01:25.286
And you know what?
I'll decorate it for free.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.555
Oh, no, that's okay.

01:27.655 --> 01:28.656
No, I want to.

01:28.756 --> 01:29.723
I heard you.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.261
Anyway,

01:33.361 --> 01:35.763
I've been saving my money
in a Schwab account.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.231
You've been investing?

01:37.331 --> 01:40.134
Oh, no, that's what
I call my Q-tip box.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.471
I got 5,000
bucks in it.

01:43.571 --> 01:44.872
(Will)
5,000?

01:44.972 --> 01:47.775
I'm so proud of you, Jack.
You're growing up.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.210
Well, thank you.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.179
So I figured I'd spend it
on an apartment

01:51.279 --> 01:54.148
or a whole lot
of Jolly Ranchers.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.417
Not the candy.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.754
Well, hey, you know what?
It's Sunday.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.856
Let's get the Village Voice
and start looking.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.225
It'll be fun.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.260
As a kid, I used to love
going to open houses

02:06.294 --> 02:07.528
on Sunday afternoons.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.232
Course, I was 12, so everything
was out of my price range.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.336
Grace, you wanna come?

02:15.436 --> 02:17.238
Oh, no, I'm going shopping
with Karen.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.508
I've gotta get my dress to wear
in my annual holiday card.

02:20.608 --> 02:23.344
Yeah...when people
send out those photos,

02:23.444 --> 02:26.380
aren't they usually
of a whole family?

02:26.480 --> 02:29.683
Yeah, like I'm gonna
wait around for that?

02:48.969 --> 02:51.572
Honey, how about
this one?

02:51.672 --> 02:52.640
This is pretty.

02:52.740 --> 02:53.741
It almost says,

02:53.841 --> 02:58.246
"It's not sad that I'm alone
in this holiday card."

02:58.346 --> 03:01.682
I'm not going to be alone.

03:01.782 --> 03:05.586
For fun, I'm going to Photoshop
George Clooney in next to me.

03:06.887 --> 03:11.459
And it just got sadder.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.327
Especially
for George Clooney.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.532
Is there a ripcord
for this shopping trip,

03:18.632 --> 03:20.768
because I'm about ready
to yank it.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.572
Speaking of yankin' it,
where are the boys today?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.640
I thought they
were coming with us.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.477
Oh, Will's helping Jack
look for apartments,

03:29.577 --> 03:33.314
and then they're gonna stop off
to see some gay penguins.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.649
[laughs]
Gay penguins.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.485
Please.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.652
Honey, that is absurd.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.522
There is no such thing
as a gay penguin!

03:41.622 --> 03:43.324
Well, well, well.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.663
Karen Walker
and her Jewess.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.567
Out for a morning shop.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.236
Well, if it isn't
Tom and Helen Willis

03:56.337 --> 03:58.472
of TV's The Jeffersons.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.709
Hello,
Beverly Leslie.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.645
How are things
in Ankleville?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.814
Not so good.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.851
Uh, my dear wife Crystal
has suddenly passed.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.821
Oh...Beverly,
I'm so sorry.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.022
Me too.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.658
Although
I never met Crystal.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.728
But, oddly, I have
met your business associate,

04:20.828 --> 04:23.931
Benji, 16 times.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.303
Including once
at The Ramrod.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.741
I'm here to buy a dress
to bury Crystal in.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.042
Honey...

04:36.143 --> 04:38.312
I think maybe you should
wear men's clothes for that.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.719
Bev...Bev, honey,
come here.

04:45.819 --> 04:49.289
You know that I love you
in...my way.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.759
And I know that you loved
Crystal in your way.

04:51.859 --> 04:56.697
So now that she's
out of the way...

04:56.797 --> 04:59.533
is there anything
that I can do for you?

04:59.633 --> 05:02.035
Well, Karen, it would
really mean a lot to me

05:02.135 --> 05:04.672
if you would attend
Crystal's memorial service

05:04.772 --> 05:05.906
tomorrow afternoon.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.876
Well, of course, Beverly.
I wouldn't miss it.

05:08.909 --> 05:09.743
And Miss Adler,
why don't you join us?

05:09.843 --> 05:11.579
Oh, no, no.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.948
I couldn't intrude
on a day that's so...

05:15.048 --> 05:16.617
intimate and personal

05:16.717 --> 05:20.621
[mumbling]
and boring.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.923
Oh, please, it's not gonna
be anything like that.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.324
It's more like a party!

05:24.425 --> 05:25.726
A celebration of her death.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.861
Life.
Life.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.634
So I'll see you both
tomorrow afternoon.

05:33.734 --> 05:37.438
I'll be receiving
from 5:30 till 6:30.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.742
Boy, that's gotta be
a long hour for you, huh?

05:46.880 --> 05:50.684
I didn't like any apartment
we've seen so far.

05:50.784 --> 05:54.722
Maybe we should call
this realtor, Eve Only.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.824
She's, like,
on every listing.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.394
Oh, look.
Here it is.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.829
Penguins.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.797
Oh, look,
they're cute.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.500
Which ones
do you think are gay?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.836
Well, if I had to pick,
I'd say the two in the corner,

06:08.936 --> 06:10.804
whispering and pointing
at all the other penguins.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.740
Ah.

06:12.840 --> 06:13.774
Yeah.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.108
Hello!
Hi.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.644
You guys are gay,
right?

06:16.744 --> 06:18.412
He is, beat him up!

06:20.448 --> 06:22.850
No, I just want you
to sign my petition.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.852
Oh, yes, of course.

06:24.952 --> 06:28.088
Thank you for watching
Jack Talk.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.389
Jack.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.560
I remember when I was
a young boy,

06:32.660 --> 06:33.861
I had
an autograph book too.

06:33.961 --> 06:34.928
Eric Estrada said to me,

06:35.028 --> 06:36.730
"Hang in there."

06:36.830 --> 06:39.867
I told him I had
an enlarged heart.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.835
It's a petition.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.971
The zoo wants to separate
the gay penguins.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.973
They wanna send Doug
to the Bronx zoo

06:46.073 --> 06:47.107
to mate with a female.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.142
Oh, great,
gays can't get married,

06:49.242 --> 06:51.144
but women in the Bronx
can have penguins imported

06:51.244 --> 06:53.781
just for sex?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.520
That is awful.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.490
They'd never separate them
if they were straight penguins.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.057
They'd just give them
a huge tax break

07:04.157 --> 07:06.126
and let them kiss on TV.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.063
Just the thought of those
two guys being split up,

07:10.163 --> 07:11.732
that really gets to me.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.834
Yeah, me too.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.904
Oh, look,
the giraffe is peeing!

07:18.939 --> 07:21.208
That's hilarious!

07:21.308 --> 07:26.013
I should find an apartment
closer to the zoo.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.481
[chuckles]

07:27.581 --> 07:28.882
You should come
to the rally tomorrow.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.151
A lot of my lesbian friends
are gonna be there.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.920
I'm not a lesbian myself.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.888
I mean, sometimes I fool
around with them...

07:34.988 --> 07:36.824
and I live with one...

07:36.924 --> 07:38.992
Hmm. I guess
I am a lesbian!

07:40.661 --> 07:42.830
Weird...
I just came out.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.064
I'd say welcome,

07:44.164 --> 07:45.799
but sounds like you've
been on that bus

07:45.899 --> 07:48.001
for quite a good
long time now.

07:49.637 --> 07:52.840
Oh, look, that one penguin's
cleaning his nest

07:52.940 --> 07:54.808
and stacking his fish
so neatly.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.645
Oh, that's Randall.
He's a real fussbudget.

07:57.745 --> 08:00.548
And the other one,
the goofy one, that's Doug.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.784
He always waddles into Randall's
nest unannounced.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.953
Oh, yeah, look.
Doug just stole his fish.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.721
And now Randall's
gonna act annoyed

08:07.821 --> 08:08.889
and be all, "Reeeh!"

08:08.989 --> 08:11.258
Even though he loves it.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.826
I'm worried about him.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.896
If Doug gets sent away,
Randall will fall apart.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.932
Really? 'Cause Randall
looks pretty together.

08:19.032 --> 08:23.236
You know, except for
the lollipop stuck to his back.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.973
He's gonna be devastated
when he's all alone.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.775
He just doesn't
know it yet.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.778
Huh.

08:30.878 --> 08:31.945
My girlfriend
did this study

08:32.045 --> 08:33.280
on gay penguins
that were separated.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.884
The one that stayed behind,
he was a mess.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.185
What happened to him?

08:38.285 --> 08:39.286
Well, he gained
a ton of weight,

08:39.386 --> 08:41.622
and all of his feathers
fell out.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.231
This is the last stop
on the tour.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.100
Feels almost inappropriate,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.702
giving a tour
of the penthouse

08:54.802 --> 08:56.704
on the day
of Crystal's memorial.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.005
Oh, my God.

08:58.105 --> 09:01.575
[gasps]
That dress is gorgeous.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.177
This is a 1954

09:04.277 --> 09:06.313
custom-made
couture gown.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.181
The only one like it
in the world.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.983
Crystal wore this gown

09:10.083 --> 09:12.653
to the 29th
annual Academy Awards,

09:12.753 --> 09:15.889
escorting the lovely
and talented Rock Hudson.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.025
She had no idea.
Can you believe it?

09:19.893 --> 09:22.029
You know what?
I can.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.868
Oh, it really
is beautiful.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.737
I'd love to feel
the fabric.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.138
Ooh, ah, ah!
No, no, no.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.573
Miss Adler,
you mustn't touch it.

09:33.674 --> 09:37.177
This gown is going
to the Smithsonian tomorrow.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.980
It's gonna be put into
their permanent collection.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.014
Ohh.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.983
How exciting for you.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.653
A dress in the Smithsonian.

09:45.753 --> 09:49.022
And your parents
in the Museum of Miniatures.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.925
Uh, Beverly,

09:52.025 --> 09:53.193
it's the minister.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.729
He wants to know where
to set up the mechanical bull.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.265
Oh, I'm coming!

09:58.365 --> 10:00.868
Such a sad, sad day.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.975
Honey...
that's the dress.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.142
That's the dress
you should wear

10:09.242 --> 10:11.111
in your lonely
holiday card.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.313
Oh, my God,
you're right.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.917
I would look so lonely
in that.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.919
I mean lovely, lovely.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.120
Come on, try it on.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.055
I'll take your picture
with my camera phone.

10:22.089 --> 10:22.956
I can't try it on.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.693
It's the woman's memorial.
It would be so disrespectful.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.060
And I don't care
if there is a cake

10:27.160 --> 10:29.329
that says "See ya"
in frosting.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.403
Honey, try it on, please?

10:36.503 --> 10:39.006
You'd look stunning in it.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.741
I would, wouldn't I?

10:45.045 --> 10:47.014
[Karen gasps]

10:47.114 --> 10:49.416
Oh...honey...

10:49.516 --> 10:53.286
You look so...beautiful
dressed as a woman.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.357
I know, right?

10:57.457 --> 10:59.259
Come on, let's
take your picture!

10:59.359 --> 11:01.194
One dignified,
one kooky.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.866
Guess we're
doin' kooky first.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.034
[knock on door]

11:08.001 --> 11:09.002
(Beverly)
Ladies, the service

11:09.036 --> 11:10.203
is about to begin.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.371
That's good enough.
Okay, quickly.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.405
Help me
get out of the dress.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.140
Be careful unzipping it.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.909
Honey, I know how to get
a woman out of a dress.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.010
I was very popular
at Sarah Lawrence.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.048
Huh.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.717
Huh?
What do you mean, huh?

11:23.817 --> 11:26.219
Well, zipper's just
a little stuck.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.354
Here, let me just--

11:27.454 --> 11:29.056
Karen,
it's really delicate.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.190
I know it's delicate!

11:30.290 --> 11:32.092
Wow, let me just
get in the right...

11:32.192 --> 11:34.327
It's--ooh!
There, I got it.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.896
Okay, good.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.297
Oof!

11:49.009 --> 11:50.911
Oh, my God.

11:51.011 --> 11:55.148
Karen...your dress
is caught in my zipper.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.350
Beverly's gonna kill me.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.451
You think
it's bad for you?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.188
I think a little bit
of my boob is caught in there.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.831
Oof.

12:10.931 --> 12:11.832
God, uhh!

12:11.932 --> 12:13.366
Ow!

12:15.002 --> 12:17.470
This is not
gonna work, Karen.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.940
Beverly's gonna see
that I'm wearing the dress.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.174
It's gonna fine.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.877
Just keep this blanket on
and walk in unison.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.914
Just two friends
in mourning.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.448
Nothing suspicious.

12:28.548 --> 12:32.019
Nothing lesbian going on.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.087
Yeah, then why is your hand
on my breast?

12:34.187 --> 12:37.524
Somebody's gotta
steer this thing.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.026
It's be a hell
of a lot easier

12:39.126 --> 12:42.963
if I had a bigger wheel
to work with.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.531
Why did you make me
try this on?!

12:44.631 --> 12:46.133
Quit yelling at me.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.301
I'm trying
to get us unstuck.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.403
Well, just keep working
on that zipper.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.905
And while
you're down there,

12:52.005 --> 12:53.540
will you pull my underwear
out of my ass?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.075
Hey, hey!

12:58.145 --> 13:00.513
Miss Adler, what on earth
are you wearing?

13:00.613 --> 13:01.781
Oh...

13:01.882 --> 13:05.218
This is the new
floor length...

13:05.318 --> 13:07.254
mourning shawl...

13:07.354 --> 13:09.489
from J. Crew.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.461
Do you like it?
It's--it's catalog only.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.964
Strange, 'cause it looks
exactly like the blanket

13:17.064 --> 13:18.966
that Crystal died in.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.800
Oh, God!

13:22.903 --> 13:25.538
Karen, may I talk
to you just a moment?

13:28.008 --> 13:30.010
Well, sure, Beverly.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.217
I meant in private.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.552
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That's so rude of me.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.388
I'll just wait over there.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.995
Karen, it's personal.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.162
Oh!

13:49.262 --> 13:50.297
I'm sorry.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.565
Of course, of course,
of course.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.502
Oh...there you go.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.005
Don't mind her.

13:58.105 --> 14:01.141
She's like a bird,
probably already asleep.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.044
Karen, it would mean
so much to me

14:04.144 --> 14:05.278
if you would come up
to the podium

14:05.378 --> 14:07.180
and say a few words
about Crystal.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.617
Oh...gosh, Bev,
I don't know.

14:10.717 --> 14:11.885
Oh, Crystal thought

14:11.985 --> 14:13.453
so highly of you.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.456
We often discussed inviting
you into our marriage...

14:16.556 --> 14:19.559
in sexual way.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.029
That's so flattering.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.031
Although I don't know
if I could have operated

14:24.131 --> 14:27.267
a pump and a defibrillator
at the same time.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.271
Oh, of course
I'll speak!

14:32.940 --> 14:34.141
Karen...

14:34.241 --> 14:35.275
Everyone sit down.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.577
The service is about
to begin.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.112
Oh, come on, relax.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.048
You got plenty of time
before they get to me.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.549
I'll get us unzipped.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.084
Welcome, everyone.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.319
Let's begin with a few words
from Karen Walker.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.888
Ohh!

14:51.691 --> 14:53.193
There you are.
Come on.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.195
Help me make some signs
for the rally at the zoo.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.131
Here, take a marker and start
drawing penguins.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.401
It's easy, you just
gotta start with Paul Giamatti,

15:01.501 --> 15:04.171
and then...

15:04.271 --> 15:05.038
stop there.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.041
I can't, Will.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.610
I've got a lease
to sign.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.145
That's right.
I found an apartment.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.647
So fast?
I know.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.950
It's all the way
down in Tribeca.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.019
New kitchen,
two bedrooms.

15:19.119 --> 15:22.522
And as soon as I heard
"hardwood," I jumped on it.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.193
Well...that's great.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.694
You have a new apartment.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.063
Meanwhile, Randall
and Doug's love igloo

15:30.163 --> 15:33.466
is melting beneath
their webbed feet.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.302
You sound like
you're not excited.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.071
I kind of thought
you'd congratulate me.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.072
Well, I'm sorry.

15:39.172 --> 15:39.939
It's just a little trivial

15:40.040 --> 15:41.441
compared to
the civil rights issue

15:41.541 --> 15:44.577
that is coming to a boil
at the penguin house!

15:44.677 --> 15:46.213
I don't get this.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.081
This morning, you were all,
"Let's find you an apartment."

15:48.181 --> 15:51.084
Now you're mad.
Why the 160?

15:53.320 --> 15:56.156
Because, even though some people
don't seem to think so,

15:56.256 --> 15:59.192
these two little guys
are a family.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.160
Will, relax.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.528
It's not that big a deal.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.631
They're just fish.
We eat 'em every day.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.733
Not that big a deal?

16:06.833 --> 16:09.736
Jack, their whole relationship
is gonna change.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.005
I mean, once they're
in separate zoos,

16:12.105 --> 16:14.441
they're not gonna be able
to swim together all the time.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.644
Or share some fish,
go for a--a waddle.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.413
Sure, they wanna
get together,

16:20.513 --> 16:22.349
but--but something's always
gonna come up.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.285
And then one day, they'll run
into each other at the gym,

16:25.385 --> 16:27.487
and it'll be all weird
and awkward,

16:27.587 --> 16:30.223
and Randall will be like,
"Oh, you look good."

16:30.323 --> 16:34.294
And Doug'll be like, "Yeah,
is that a feather toupee?"

16:35.328 --> 16:37.064
I mean, they used to be
best friends,

16:37.164 --> 16:38.565
and now they don't even
know each other.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.101
Oh, Will, would you
wait a minute?

16:41.201 --> 16:42.635
No, I gotta go.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.138
Congratulations
on your new apartment.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.608
Finally, jeez,
just like pulling teeth.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.482
Grace would
like to say

16:55.582 --> 16:58.185
the traditional
Jewish prayer for the dead.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.553
Oh! Well,
how delightful.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.692
Um...

17:05.792 --> 17:07.627
Yit-gadal...

17:07.727 --> 17:10.730
v'yit-kadash...

17:10.830 --> 17:13.266
um...

17:13.366 --> 17:16.769
Osha gosha bygosha.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.241
[chanting in fake Hebrew]

17:32.319 --> 17:35.222
Spielberg, Katzenberg,
Geffen...

17:35.322 --> 17:42.195
* Aaaaaa-men *

17:42.295 --> 17:46.633
Oh, Miss Adler,
that was just beautiful!

17:46.733 --> 17:48.535
You know what else
is beautiful?

17:48.635 --> 17:50.203
I just got us unstuck.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.304
Oh, thank God.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.405
Okay, I'm gonna go
get out of this.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.176
[gasps]

17:57.344 --> 18:00.113
Beverly, I am so sorry.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.314
No, no,
I don't wanna hear it.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.749
I don't
want to hear it!

18:02.849 --> 18:05.518
Miss Adler, how dare you
come into my home

18:05.618 --> 18:08.755
and desecrate the day
that I have set aside

18:08.855 --> 18:10.357
to celebrate
my wife's death!

18:10.457 --> 18:12.225
Life.
Life!

18:13.460 --> 18:16.196
Why do I keep
saying that?!

18:16.296 --> 18:19.098
I'm so sorry.
I feel horrible.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.600
No, I just want you
to go, please.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.169
Go, get out of the dress.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.538
See, the thing is
is that the zipper's tricky.

18:25.638 --> 18:29.376
And...see, it's--
it's stuck again.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.277
I'll help!
I'm good a that.

18:30.377 --> 18:31.611
No, stay away!

18:34.281 --> 18:35.382
Hey, Will.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.649
I'm glad I found you.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.318
There's another protest
going on

18:38.418 --> 18:39.452
over at the seal tank.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.721
I guess they're gay, too,
because apparently

18:41.821 --> 18:43.223
people don't want them
to go clubbing.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.824
I don't know.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.229
You know...

18:49.329 --> 18:50.530
I thought about
what you said,

18:51.631 --> 18:53.833
and I realized you weren't
talking about the penguins.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.668
You were talking about us.

18:55.768 --> 18:59.272
You're like a rice cooker.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.607
Takes you a long time,

19:00.707 --> 19:02.642
but when it comes out,
it's perfect.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.380
I'm sorry about before.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.249
I just--I was
being selfish.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.450
And I was wrong.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.819
And I'm really excited
about your new place.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.655
Oh, thanks, Will.
But I'm not moving.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.357
All that money
I had is gone.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.892
I spent it on some
stupid impulse buy.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.261
Hey, guys, guess what?

19:21.361 --> 19:23.162
An anonymous donor
just gave the Bronx Zoo

19:23.263 --> 19:24.597
enough money
to buy its own penguin.

19:24.697 --> 19:27.234
Doug and Randall don't
have to be separated.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.469
But don't say anything.
I wanna tell them myself.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.675
An anonymous donor?

19:35.775 --> 19:37.810
I can't believe
you did that.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.812
I can't believe they called it
an anonymous donor.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.615
I said my name like 30 times.
It's supposed to be on the news!

19:45.952 --> 19:47.654
I am so impressed with you.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.589
I never even thought
of donating money.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.890
How did you know
how much to give?

19:50.990 --> 19:52.925
[scoffs]
I'm not an idiot, Will.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.528
I think I know how much
a penguin costs.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.197
But that was
your apartment money.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.466
You were gonna
sign the lease.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.269
I-I can't believe
you did that for me.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.871
Well, not just for you.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.574
You made me realize
I don't wanna move either.

20:07.674 --> 20:11.244
And I thought,
if we get to stay together,

20:11.344 --> 20:13.212
they should too.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.782
Even if one of them
is fat and bald.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.453
Look at them.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.655
They really are cute,
aren't they?

20:22.755 --> 20:23.890
Yeah.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.495
Why is that female one
always hanging around them?

20:34.634 --> 20:36.303
Here, let me try.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.437
Okay, it's really delicate.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.505
Yes, I know it's delicate.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.341
I put it on Benji
100 times.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.979
I just have to get
a run out of it.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.415
There!

20:49.449 --> 20:51.284
Okay, good, all right.
I'll go take off the dress.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.319
[grunts]

20:59.025 --> 20:59.091
Grace, you got a little
something stuck to you.
