<i>Okay. So, Karen, she actually didn't
stand by her man in a physical sense.</i>

00:21.507 --> 00:23.073
<i>What does that mean?</i>

00:23.075 --> 00:25.575
<i>What that means is
that she is putting some distance</i>

00:25.577 --> 00:27.677
<i>between herself and her husband.</i>

00:27.679 --> 00:30.414
<i>The couples and lovers, what

00:51.603 --> 00:52.805
My car reeks.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.541
You saw me leave with Chelsea.

00:57.975 --> 01:01.413
That's got nothing to do with anything.
Chelsea, Lara, the Marlboro Man,

01:02.347 --> 01:04.647
doesn't really matter, does it?

01:04.650 --> 01:05.883
Calm down.

01:05.885 --> 01:09.720
I'm calm. I'm very calm. I'm
trying to tell you something.

01:09.722 --> 01:10.823
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:14.692 --> 01:15.694
Look at this.

01:18.496 --> 01:19.766
Maybe it was Chelsea.

01:20.999 --> 01:23.036
This is incredible. I...

01:25.136 --> 01:26.369
Where are you going?

01:26.371 --> 01:28.904
I'm going to get you
a new glass.

01:28.906 --> 01:31.875
- Please don't make a thing.
- It's like a ghost town in here.

01:31.877 --> 01:33.980
It's fine. I'm fine.
Someone will come.

01:44.656 --> 01:47.723
Oh crap, you were supposed
to remind me to call Harold.

01:47.725 --> 01:48.660
Call Harold.

01:50.161 --> 01:53.696
I asked you to remind me
to call Harold at seven.

01:53.698 --> 01:54.633
What time is it?

01:56.601 --> 01:57.602
What time is it?

01:59.505 --> 02:01.070
- Calm down.
- I'm calm.

02:01.072 --> 02:03.073
Well, then you need
to work on your tact.

02:03.075 --> 02:04.974
My... my tact?

02:04.976 --> 02:10.646
I... I asked you for three things
yesterday. You remember?

02:10.649 --> 02:11.651
Simple things.

02:12.651 --> 02:16.420
Remind me to call Harold
at seven o'clock today.

02:16.422 --> 02:17.854
- Don't smoke...
- I don't.

02:17.856 --> 02:19.122
- In my car.
- I didn't.

02:19.124 --> 02:20.793
-because I just had it washed

02:22.427 --> 02:25.428
and I would like to be able to drive my
associates around without having that...

02:25.430 --> 02:27.733
that smell in the car.

02:29.133 --> 02:31.070
And to please, please

02:32.103 --> 02:36.576
not have that blank expression
on your face while we're here.

02:39.710 --> 02:42.646
You know I... I think that you're
going out of your way to...

02:42.648 --> 02:44.814
I'd wear whatever expression
I want to express, okay?

02:44.816 --> 02:46.451
Okay, yeah, that's...
that's really mature.

02:49.054 --> 02:49.956
Okay.

02:50.856 --> 02:54.190
All right, look,
I don't want to fight,

02:54.192 --> 02:57.062
but you're really

02:59.697 --> 03:02.768
not making it easy.

03:06.672 --> 03:08.007
That was an important call.

03:10.843 --> 03:14.544
It's not my responsibility because
you asked me to remind you.

03:14.546 --> 03:16.246
It's... it's not about
responsibility,

03:16.248 --> 03:18.785
it's simply doing what you
said you were going to do.

03:19.885 --> 03:21.821
It's Marcus.

03:23.988 --> 03:24.923
Marcus, hi.

03:25.891 --> 03:27.059
Yeah, we're inside.

03:28.626 --> 03:30.493
We got in last night.

03:30.495 --> 03:31.695
What?

03:31.697 --> 03:33.566
No, no, I missed him.

03:34.566 --> 03:36.533
Yeah, no, I know.

03:36.535 --> 03:37.502
Where are you?

03:38.504 --> 03:39.105
What's that?

03:40.839 --> 03:42.442
Yeah, got it. Coming up.

03:44.675 --> 03:48.548
Can you take care of the check?
And meet me outside in five?

03:51.048 --> 03:52.784
- What is it?
- Nothing.

03:55.186 --> 03:56.121
What is it?

03:57.055 --> 03:58.458
Nothing. I just

04:00.158 --> 04:01.060
feel like

04:03.695 --> 04:06.031
haven't we had
this conversation before?

04:07.798 --> 04:08.967
We certainly have.

04:31.723 --> 04:32.725
Here you are.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.796
This place is more
inviting, don't you think?

04:38.329 --> 04:40.800
Can't quite put
my finger on it but...

04:42.200 --> 04:43.168
Excuse me?

04:44.236 --> 04:46.101
Nice.

04:46.103 --> 04:48.240
Always comes back
to comfort, doesn't it?

04:49.140 --> 04:51.340
Of course, we try
everything else first.

04:51.342 --> 04:55.044
We're always trying to reinvent
these concepts, these places,

04:55.046 --> 04:59.683
or either high-tech or they got
these Geisha things going.

04:59.685 --> 05:02.885
But, after all
the extravagant ideas,

05:02.887 --> 05:06.188
all comes back to simple
comfort. How are you?

05:06.190 --> 05:07.592
I'm okay. Thank you.

05:08.793 --> 05:10.897
- You're here.
- Yes.

05:13.798 --> 05:16.899
I think you must have me
confused with someone.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.234
Who could I confuse you with?

05:18.236 --> 05:19.538
Here you are, madam.

05:20.839 --> 05:22.909
Sorry, but I've never
seen you before.

05:24.041 --> 05:25.741
Are you serious?

05:25.743 --> 05:26.945
Must be someone else.

05:28.613 --> 05:30.947
Oh, you are, or you were.

05:30.949 --> 05:32.181
What?

05:32.183 --> 05:34.650
- When?
- When we were together.

05:34.652 --> 05:35.120
Oh.

05:36.687 --> 05:37.988
Okay.

05:37.990 --> 05:39.625
I see what's going on here.

05:40.726 --> 05:42.028
You're the crazy guy.

05:46.932 --> 05:48.167
This isn't who you are.

05:49.067 --> 05:50.336
Must be someone else.

06:38.716 --> 06:39.385
One more?

06:41.385 --> 06:42.220
Please.

06:56.801 --> 06:57.669
Try this.

07:01.238 --> 07:03.675
Double oak, eighteen years.

07:13.017 --> 07:15.654
So, these... these two
blondes come in last night,

07:16.988 --> 07:18.290
not much older than this,

07:19.923 --> 07:22.825
and there's like, you know, like a hundred
people in the place last night, right?

07:22.827 --> 07:24.760
But these two, whoo, oh no.

07:24.762 --> 07:26.832
Legs, wheesh, here to heaven.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.933
You know, I'm busy making drinks,
this guy, that guy, right?

07:30.935 --> 07:34.406
Less than a half an hour later
I hear this huge crash, right?

07:35.307 --> 07:36.208
I go to look,

07:37.409 --> 07:41.911
the two of them are at each
other like pit bulls, right?

07:41.913 --> 07:43.746
And here's the best part.

07:43.748 --> 07:49.017
This kid tries to pull one of them off the other
and he gets his hands up there, you know.

07:49.019 --> 07:52.020
The other one
fucking freaks out.

07:52.022 --> 07:56.825
She is like, "Get your fucking hands
off, are you a fucking asshole?"

07:56.827 --> 08:00.130
And she punches
the kid right in the face.

08:00.132 --> 08:03.202
Then they go right back
at it with each other.

08:06.171 --> 08:09.873
Took like me, the host, three
waiters to pull them apart,

08:09.875 --> 08:11.744
all of us scared to get
our hands on them.

08:12.544 --> 08:14.714
You know? Crazy, man.

08:15.914 --> 08:17.850
Not a half an hour
they were here.

08:18.849 --> 08:20.283
They come in drunk?

08:20.285 --> 08:22.921
That or something else,
you know, this place,

08:24.089 --> 08:25.056
little something.

08:43.340 --> 08:44.310
Wonderful.

08:47.445 --> 08:49.111
You mind?

08:49.113 --> 08:51.050
Not at all. Please.

08:52.184 --> 08:55.087
No, when I say mind,
I mean tell the host.

08:56.421 --> 08:59.489
I wouldn't dream
of it. Thank you.

08:59.491 --> 09:00.326
Cheers.

09:01.392 --> 09:04.095
I mean, I guess it's all
the same really, isn't it?

09:05.030 --> 09:06.596
Booze, drugs.

09:06.598 --> 09:10.265
You know, for some people it's
food, other people it's work.

09:10.267 --> 09:12.202
Oh, I don't know about that.

09:12.204 --> 09:13.171
Absolutely.

09:15.306 --> 09:18.844
What do they say when you get
stopped for driving drunk?

09:20.512 --> 09:22.477
- Under the influence.
- Yeah.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.483
And what do they say when
you get stopped for, say, weed?

09:26.618 --> 09:27.920
Under the influence.

09:29.253 --> 09:33.021
You know, influences may be
different, how they influence us,

09:33.023 --> 09:34.793
but they're all, you know,

09:37.027 --> 09:38.196
influences.

09:39.129 --> 09:39.864
Right.

09:41.266 --> 09:45.068
Well, I mean you certainly don't go
to jail for being drunk in a bar

09:45.070 --> 09:48.071
but I imagine if I pulled
out a syringe right now...

09:48.073 --> 09:52.244
Well, you know, that depends on what country
you're in and what's in that syringe. I mean,

09:53.177 --> 09:55.645
some places they don't
arrest you at all for drugs.

09:55.647 --> 10:00.350
And guess what?
People use less drugs there.

10:00.352 --> 10:06.121
It all depends on who's making these
decisions and what their interests are.

10:06.123 --> 10:09.958
What was the first illegal drug
in the United States?

10:09.960 --> 10:11.327
Do you know?

10:11.329 --> 10:12.198
Opium.

10:13.565 --> 10:16.199
Do you know why
it was made illegal?

10:17.199 --> 10:17.869
- Heroin addict?
- No.

10:19.503 --> 10:23.438
Opium comes from
the Chinese. In 1875, right?

10:23.440 --> 10:27.242
They had these dens where you'd go
and just smoke yourself stupid.

10:27.244 --> 10:29.147
Who do you think
smoked the most?

10:30.415 --> 10:32.318
- Chinese men.
- And?

10:33.984 --> 10:35.019
Take a guess.

10:36.421 --> 10:37.388
Poor whites.

10:38.455 --> 10:40.291
Middle-class housewives.

10:43.127 --> 10:44.794
- Should've guessed it.
- Yeah.

10:44.796 --> 10:51.934
White middle-class housewives and marginalized
shit on by the man, Chinese guys.

10:51.936 --> 10:53.970
So then what happens?

10:53.972 --> 10:57.206
Chinese men fucked the
housewives in the dens.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.574
The housewives fucked
the Chinese guys.

10:59.576 --> 11:04.981
But the reason cited
was that these young

11:04.983 --> 11:08.650
respectable Americans
were being morally corrupted.

11:08.652 --> 11:12.487
You see, the rich white men
who make the laws

11:12.489 --> 11:17.025
didn't like their boring, bored
wives, their Christian wives,

11:17.027 --> 11:21.731
cheating on them with these
dirty, stupid immigrants.

11:21.733 --> 11:24.433
So, they put the machine
to work, right?

11:24.435 --> 11:27.437
Hatred, fear, ridicule,

11:27.439 --> 11:32.174
and then they think these dens aren't
making us any money, screw this.

11:32.176 --> 11:33.611
So then they say

11:35.579 --> 11:36.547
criminal.

11:38.083 --> 11:38.951
You see,

11:40.285 --> 11:42.718
the power
to influence influence.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.291
Laws are the greatest
power of all, are they not?

11:47.325 --> 11:51.363
The power to say this influence
is right and this one is wrong.

11:55.367 --> 11:57.703
You have something
against Chinese men?

12:00.037 --> 12:04.073
- No, sir, not at all.
- No. Just I said just a little...

12:04.075 --> 12:06.608
Yeah. No, no sir, not me. No.

12:06.610 --> 12:09.480
Great race. Just
a student of history.

12:11.016 --> 12:12.685
You know I'm not being serious.

13:46.810 --> 13:50.178
No, no. On the... on the
amendment,

13:50.180 --> 13:52.215
what is the number that it says?

13:52.217 --> 13:55.717
Right, right. And now go
to the original agreement,

13:55.719 --> 13:57.355
0.3 paragraph two.

13:58.623 --> 14:00.691
But what... what is the number
that that says?

14:02.326 --> 14:07.230
Exactly. Exactly. So you see... no,
no, you don't see... you don't see.

14:07.232 --> 14:08.700
It's inaccurate, Terry.

14:10.334 --> 14:13.372
It forgets that we paid half
the fucking fees on signing.

14:14.638 --> 14:16.572
So, the amendment...

14:16.574 --> 14:19.377
Terry, the amendment,
go to the amendment, amend it.

14:57.348 --> 14:59.751
My car smells like an ashtray.

15:01.685 --> 15:03.354
You saw me leave with Chelsea.

15:04.656 --> 15:06.291
What does that have
to do with anything?

15:07.758 --> 15:09.695
I mean, really how
does that help me?

15:11.228 --> 15:13.728
You're telling me it was Chelsea
who smoked in my car.

15:13.730 --> 15:15.331
But why did you let
her smoke in my car?

15:15.333 --> 15:19.367
Better yet, did you even think
about asking her not to?

15:19.369 --> 15:21.571
You like what you're
doing right now.

15:21.573 --> 15:24.439
What am I doing? I'm trying to
figure out why my car reeks.

15:24.441 --> 15:25.911
And what will that give you?

15:27.344 --> 15:31.215
It will help me ascertain the means
to prevent it from happening again.

15:32.550 --> 15:34.616
So, the next time I use my car...

15:34.618 --> 15:36.851
- Stop.
- to drive my associates around...

15:36.853 --> 15:38.020
I get it.

15:38.022 --> 15:39.855
...it won't smell like somebody
dumped a fucking ashtray...

15:39.857 --> 15:41.991
- I didn't smoke in your car, okay?
- into the AC.

15:41.993 --> 15:43.328
I don't give a shit.

15:59.243 --> 16:00.745
Did you have to call somebody?

16:01.945 --> 16:02.680
Yes.

16:04.015 --> 16:04.850
Harold.

16:08.619 --> 16:11.386
Shit, I was supposed
to call him at seven-thirty.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.822
And it's seven-thirty-seven.

16:12.824 --> 16:16.524
Yes. Well, he's very punctual,
some people are.

16:16.526 --> 16:18.497
- I see.
- Harold. Hi.

16:19.397 --> 16:20.766
Yes. Is it a good time?

16:22.367 --> 16:24.303
No, sure, sure, yeah.

16:25.270 --> 16:25.971
No problem.

16:27.004 --> 16:29.005
Twelve. Yeah.

16:29.007 --> 16:30.776
Noon sharp. See you then.

16:35.979 --> 16:37.281
Look at this.

16:44.488 --> 16:45.854
Sir.

16:45.856 --> 16:48.357
My wife's glass is broken.

16:48.359 --> 16:49.457
Oh.

16:49.459 --> 16:52.661
- Oh, no, I'm so sorry.
- She could have cut herself.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.929
And I'm so glad
she did not, sir.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.332
Our sincerest apologies, ma'am.

16:57.334 --> 17:00.572
Please allow me to come right
back with a new glass and

17:01.672 --> 17:03.342
complement bottle of wine.

17:04.075 --> 17:05.006
Thank you.

17:05.008 --> 17:06.775
Another Saint Estephe?

17:06.777 --> 17:08.044
That's fine.

17:08.046 --> 17:09.347
Yes, sir. Right away.

17:18.021 --> 17:19.888
That's Marcus.

17:19.891 --> 17:21.759
He's outside. Will you join us?

17:24.761 --> 17:25.863
Will you join us?

17:26.863 --> 17:28.863
I'd rather not, no.

17:28.865 --> 17:29.634
Oh.

17:31.001 --> 17:33.738
So, you won't join us. You just

17:35.707 --> 17:37.773
sit there alone.

17:37.775 --> 17:40.642
With that look on
your face like a ghost.

17:40.644 --> 17:41.546
Yes.

17:53.357 --> 17:55.890
I'm actually going to borrow
this chair for a moment.

17:55.892 --> 17:57.993
You don't mind, do you?

17:57.995 --> 18:00.563
There's quite
a few chairs around.

18:00.565 --> 18:03.067
Yeah, but they just
don't quite have the view.

18:04.736 --> 18:07.305
You got a point though, it is
kind of slow in here tonight.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.908
Maybe it was just the last time
I was here was so memorable.

18:12.910 --> 18:14.379
Sounds exciting.

18:15.747 --> 18:17.846
It's amazing how
they're made, isn't it?

18:17.848 --> 18:18.883
What? Chairs?

18:20.084 --> 18:21.420
No. Memories.

18:23.020 --> 18:26.057
They're one of those things that the
moment you try to describe them, they're

18:27.458 --> 18:28.360
gone.

18:29.861 --> 18:35.598
For instance, last night I'm smoking
a cigarette and I hear this piano.

18:35.600 --> 18:39.168
The sound is familiar.

18:39.170 --> 18:42.004
It's not even a melody
but I know it somehow,

18:42.006 --> 18:44.008
so I start following this sound

18:45.642 --> 18:47.075
and there's nobody there.

18:47.077 --> 18:48.777
Was that in my head?

18:48.779 --> 18:50.146
Maybe.

18:50.148 --> 18:53.948
It's like these memories they can
just surface out of nowhere.

18:53.950 --> 18:55.453
No logic really.

18:58.055 --> 19:01.489
So, what's the first
memory you have right now...

19:01.491 --> 19:04.560
- Me?
- without thinking about it? Yes, you.

19:04.562 --> 19:06.294
Is this a pop quiz?

19:06.296 --> 19:12.435
First thing that comes, the first memory
that you can think of right now. Anything.

19:12.437 --> 19:13.669
Okay.

19:13.671 --> 19:15.838
Okay, I remember

19:15.840 --> 19:17.876
my sister burning herself

19:19.043 --> 19:20.508
with hot water.

19:20.510 --> 19:21.479
It's interesting.

19:22.712 --> 19:23.547
You?

19:24.681 --> 19:26.282
I...

19:26.284 --> 19:31.786
I remember seeing a beautiful woman sat
alone in an otherwise ordinary place.

19:31.788 --> 19:32.824
And

19:33.990 --> 19:35.426
I sat opposite her

19:37.094 --> 19:38.764
in a very comfortable chair

19:40.163 --> 19:42.500
and I struck out,
so I came here.

19:45.702 --> 19:47.469
That's quite an approach.

19:47.471 --> 19:50.473
Yeah. It's actually
better than the last time.

19:50.475 --> 19:51.076
When?

19:52.543 --> 19:53.678
When we met.

19:54.879 --> 19:56.548
Oh, okay.

19:57.515 --> 19:58.746
I see.

19:58.748 --> 20:02.083
Well, this...
this is amusing.

20:02.085 --> 20:03.518
Oh, it is?

20:03.520 --> 20:05.053
- Yeah.
- Amusing?

20:05.055 --> 20:06.056
Yes, it is.

20:07.792 --> 20:11.663
I'm sorry, I think you
think I'm someone else.

20:12.563 --> 20:13.428
Oh.

20:13.430 --> 20:16.133
But who do you think
I think you are?

20:18.068 --> 20:19.437
Someone you knew.

20:20.136 --> 20:23.441
And you are not someone
I knew, you're saying.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.144
Okay, listen.

20:28.613 --> 20:31.048
You seem very nice.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.620
You have one of those faces.

20:37.955 --> 20:40.255
But, one, I'm not
exactly available;

20:40.257 --> 20:43.661
and, two, I've never seen
you before in my life ever.

20:44.929 --> 20:49.864
So, at first I thought you were funny
and this was all funny and charming.

20:49.866 --> 20:54.102
And then I thought you were confused. And
now I don't quite know what to think.

20:54.104 --> 20:55.039
Then don't.

20:56.740 --> 20:57.709
Don't think.

21:17.260 --> 21:19.797
- Here you are, madam.
- Thank you.

21:36.346 --> 21:38.249
Looks like it's just
you and me now.

22:10.014 --> 22:10.748
Hi.

22:11.681 --> 22:12.584
Yeah.

22:13.316 --> 22:14.184
How are you?

22:15.987 --> 22:17.288
Okay. Yeah.

22:19.323 --> 22:20.292
Last night.

22:22.293 --> 22:25.263
It's actually getting
nice here. Yeah.

22:30.267 --> 22:32.001
- Is it?
- May I, Miss?

22:32.003 --> 22:33.369
Sorry.

22:33.371 --> 22:34.272
Thank you.

22:36.407 --> 22:37.842
No, he's just...

22:39.943 --> 22:42.980
he's just trying
around to be his best.

22:44.248 --> 22:47.251
Yeah. No, just
wanted to talk to you.

23:06.303 --> 23:09.037
Yeah, okay. So, here's the plan.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.773
- Yes.
- It'll be in by Tuesday.

23:10.775 --> 23:12.707
Okay. Well, when am I
going to get my numbers?

23:12.709 --> 23:13.909
It'll be before Tuesday.

23:13.911 --> 23:15.843
Well, how will it be
before Tuesday, Kath?

23:15.845 --> 23:17.813
Because you're going to
fucking help me, Marcus.

23:17.815 --> 23:20.114
We can't push the meeting.

23:20.116 --> 23:21.315
Good.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.884
We can't?

23:22.886 --> 23:24.386
We can't.

23:24.388 --> 23:25.920
Look...

23:25.922 --> 23:28.724
No, we can't. This is... that'll be the
last day that we can have the meeting.

23:28.726 --> 23:30.892
So, that has to
be put together...

23:30.894 --> 23:32.428
All makes cool so I have to...

23:32.430 --> 23:34.729
- That's fine.
- choose Tuesday. Doesn't get any better.

23:34.731 --> 23:36.532
- Tuesday is...
- I understand.

23:36.534 --> 23:42.873
All right, look, I don't really care about the
how... how was your area. Just tell me when.

23:44.107 --> 23:45.440
It'll be Tuesday.

23:45.442 --> 23:49.745
Tuesday or before Tuesday? Because
you just said before Tuesday.

23:49.747 --> 23:52.313
Tuesday, the day after Monday.

23:52.315 --> 23:54.749
Well, I... I--I know what
comes after Monday...

23:54.751 --> 23:55.984
Hey, Marcus... Marcus.

23:55.986 --> 23:57.188
- Dude.
- What?

23:58.288 --> 24:00.188
Do we know that guy?

24:00.190 --> 24:02.224
- Who?
- I don't know.

24:02.226 --> 24:05.360
Look, the... the point is, can...
can we just stay focused here?

24:05.362 --> 24:08.330
- I would love to.
- We have to keep the message consistent.

24:08.332 --> 24:09.133
Okay.

24:10.234 --> 24:11.736
Yes, I'm by myself.

24:12.769 --> 24:13.404
Yes.

24:15.972 --> 24:16.907
Yes. So,

24:18.042 --> 24:22.747
I'm sitting there and this man
comes right up to me,

24:24.014 --> 24:26.348
talks about some nonsense.

24:26.350 --> 24:30.388
Um. I don't know, I... I think,
like, he knew me or something.

24:31.889 --> 24:33.858
Yeah, it was just so weird.

24:35.892 --> 24:38.962
Yeah. Yeah, no, I've never
seen him before in my life.

24:39.997 --> 24:41.900
Yes, I'm sure. Mm-hm.

24:44.468 --> 24:45.469
I don't know.

24:46.804 --> 24:49.807
Just somehow bothers me.

24:51.040 --> 24:51.842
Yeah.

24:55.446 --> 24:56.414
Yeah. you're right.

24:58.783 --> 24:59.350
Yes.

25:02.018 --> 25:02.921
Okay.

25:05.456 --> 25:08.093
Yes, I'll call you tomorrow. Hm.

25:10.527 --> 25:13.131
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

25:35.084 --> 25:38.323
Do I dare disturb the universe?

25:39.989 --> 25:43.060
In a minute there is time

25:44.161 --> 25:49.366
for decisions and revisions,
which a minute will reverse.

25:51.568 --> 25:55.172
Time for you and time for me.

25:56.841 --> 26:01.780
Time to prepare a face
to meet the faces that you meet.

26:19.462 --> 26:26.935
Time for a hundred visions and
revisions before the toast and tea.

26:26.937 --> 26:32.207
A time to murder and
create to drop a question,

26:32.209 --> 26:35.814
to drop a question
on your plate.

26:39.216 --> 26:42.085
Can't get any sleep
around here.

27:16.386 --> 27:17.888
Can I help you, ma'am?

27:20.257 --> 27:21.258
So white.

27:23.326 --> 27:25.960
Would it be possible to get
a couple of extra towels please?

27:25.962 --> 27:28.596
Right away, ma'am. I can bring
them to your room.

27:28.598 --> 27:30.564
What is your room
number, please?

27:30.566 --> 27:33.337
- I'll just take them now. Thank you.
- Certainly, ma'am.

27:37.975 --> 27:38.806
Thank you.

27:38.808 --> 27:40.911
- Have a lovely evening.
- Thank you.

29:32.189 --> 29:36.259
So, my sister and I would
go to my grandparents by the lake.

29:37.594 --> 29:41.199
They used to let us play by
ourselves outside before dinner.

29:42.266 --> 29:45.766
- There was this boy in the next house.
- Mhm.

29:45.768 --> 29:47.505
We wanted
to be around him.

29:48.771 --> 29:54.109
We didn't know which one of us
he liked. We're ten and nine.

29:54.111 --> 29:56.178
He's twelve.

29:56.180 --> 29:57.711
Uh-huh, yeah.

29:57.713 --> 30:01.483
So, we'd get dirty
when we played with him.

30:01.485 --> 30:03.621
And then this one time

30:04.787 --> 30:08.692
we went to the kitchen to clean
ourselves up before dinner.

30:10.594 --> 30:14.399
I knew the faucet was boiling
water but my sister didn't know.

30:16.266 --> 30:17.666
Go on.

30:17.668 --> 30:20.802
And she went
right for that faucet,

30:20.804 --> 30:23.107
right for that boiling water

30:24.373 --> 30:25.208
to drink it.

30:26.343 --> 30:29.313
And I just watched her
scold her face,

30:30.413 --> 30:32.115
like I was frozen.

30:33.484 --> 30:35.420
I had the instinct to stop her.

30:36.687 --> 30:38.356
I just couldn't.

30:42.159 --> 30:43.061
And then?

31:20.163 --> 31:21.196
Emma!

31:50.661 --> 31:52.330
Emma, where are you?

32:01.270 --> 32:02.539
Where are you?

32:05.875 --> 32:06.877
Emma?

33:08.337 --> 33:09.737
I found you!

33:49.980 --> 33:50.915
Babe.

33:55.384 --> 33:57.484
I like the blue one.

33:57.486 --> 33:58.388
Come on.

34:00.756 --> 34:02.525
I like the one with circles.

34:03.493 --> 34:04.926
Squares?

34:04.928 --> 34:06.661
Circles.

34:06.663 --> 34:08.799
Okay. How about squares?

34:10.866 --> 34:12.600
Diamonds.

34:12.601 --> 34:14.034
Diamonds?

34:14.036 --> 34:14.739
Hm.

34:15.705 --> 34:17.339
Do the one with the diamonds.

34:17.341 --> 34:18.940
Okay, I'll do the one
with the diamonds.

34:18.942 --> 34:20.775
No, the one with the rectangles.

34:20.777 --> 34:22.446
I was thinking yellow diamonds.

34:46.703 --> 34:48.803
I've got to run
to some meetings.

34:48.804 --> 34:50.605
I'll see you for dinner.

34:50.607 --> 34:52.342
- Okay.
- Good.

34:57.547 --> 34:58.315
Be good.

35:27.944 --> 35:29.346
Hi. Good morning.

35:30.647 --> 35:32.415
Can I please have some coffee?

35:36.752 --> 35:42.093
<i>No time, no
energy, no desire, no worries.</i>

35:48.931 --> 35:52.199
<i>Rescued from a hunting
preserve in the Amazon basin,</i>

35:52.201 --> 35:55.069
<i>the big cat enjoys
her newfound freedom</i>

35:55.071 --> 35:57.741
<i>by showing off her
aquatic hunting skills.</i>

36:01.812 --> 36:05.746
<i>It is uncommon for a jaguar
to find herself underwater.</i>

36:05.748 --> 36:11.455
<i>And observing her adaptability in the
unfamiliar environment is a rare sight indeed.</i>

36:13.689 --> 36:17.727
<i>It's clear that even here
she is guided by scent.</i>

37:07.511 --> 37:08.212
James?

37:09.812 --> 37:11.614
What a coincidence?

37:13.716 --> 37:15.018
Well, that's great.

37:18.955 --> 37:20.054
- That.
- Why?

37:20.056 --> 37:22.156
That has the fastest top speed,

37:22.158 --> 37:25.859
highest torque, highest horse,
thirty, sixty, a hundred. Period.

37:25.861 --> 37:29.696
Okay, but look at the car. It's not a car.
It's sort of fucking doom buggy thing.

37:29.698 --> 37:33.768
I already have a luxury car,
okay? I have a car for that.

37:33.770 --> 37:36.239
So, if I'm going to get
a second car, that's it.

37:37.573 --> 37:40.074
Be careful, you're
dealing with his dream car.

37:40.076 --> 37:42.146
Yeah. I mean, hey, come
on now, a man can dream.

37:43.980 --> 37:44.978
It's got nothing on my camera.

37:44.980 --> 37:48.283
Okay,
please don't do that.

37:48.285 --> 37:49.650
Okay, I actually
kind of hate that.

37:49.652 --> 37:52.185
I mean, we're having like a serious
conversation about real cars.

37:52.187 --> 37:56.257
Your Camry, which... okay, a
luxury, the Range, right.

37:56.259 --> 37:59.326
- Mhm.
- For the price, not a brilliant buy.

37:59.328 --> 38:02.129
And I'm not being arrogant, I'm just
experienced, there's a difference.

38:02.131 --> 38:04.132
Mhm. Okay.

38:04.134 --> 38:08.835
You know, it's the first time I've
eaten red meat in like a month.

38:08.837 --> 38:10.904
Yeah? Weird.

38:10.906 --> 38:12.339
I eat red meat every day.

38:12.341 --> 38:14.676
Every day? Every day
you mean red meat?

38:14.678 --> 38:16.777
Well, like five times a week.

38:16.779 --> 38:19.647
- Hmm.
- I probably eat fish five times a week.

38:19.649 --> 38:21.585
You must
glow in the dark.

38:24.988 --> 38:26.156
To tell you the truth,

38:27.991 --> 38:32.930
the only problem I'm having is I feel like I'm
driving around a hundred-thousand-dollar ashtray.

38:34.797 --> 38:36.267
Other than that,
the car is fine.

38:38.268 --> 38:40.801
Those things are
better left to mechanics.

38:40.803 --> 38:42.906
- So in correctness...
- Oh, have you been...?

38:44.341 --> 38:46.841
I didn't smoke in
your car, okay?

38:46.843 --> 38:48.842
Have you been... have
you been to Caracas?

38:48.844 --> 38:50.247
Marcus and I
just went last month.

38:51.214 --> 38:55.049
You know what? They
kidnap people there, every day.

38:55.051 --> 38:59.252
Sometimes the same people, every week,
and they ask for smaller amounts.

38:59.254 --> 39:06.027
It's big business. They... they charge these
diplomats and rich families up to ten grand a pop.

39:06.029 --> 39:10.968
They take their kids twice a year, not once
a week, darling. They are intelligent.

39:12.768 --> 39:15.870
I don't know what would... once a
week is fine. They might as well.

39:15.872 --> 39:19.339
- But becomes a little predictable, don't you think?
- Yes.

39:19.341 --> 39:21.308
Have you heard about this?

39:21.310 --> 39:24.212
Have you heard about this
kidnapping industry thing?

39:24.214 --> 39:25.980
One second, okay?

39:25.982 --> 39:28.052
Belize.
Have you been?

39:28.984 --> 39:30.784
- Yeah, I think so.
- Oh, okay.

39:30.786 --> 39:33.987
I... I just... we went there
and I am a travel snob, but...

39:33.989 --> 39:36.593
so we stayed at the best
hotel, the best hotel,

39:37.393 --> 39:41.131
and I actually wrote a thank-you
email. I'll show you this email.

39:42.399 --> 39:45.033
I'm thinking he's really nice

39:45.035 --> 39:48.835
but is that a skill set that's
going to supplement my income?

39:48.837 --> 39:53.076
- Now what does he actually do?
- He's a fashion designer.

39:54.210 --> 39:55.176
Ouch.

39:55.178 --> 39:56.678
What, what's wrong with that?

39:56.680 --> 39:57.982
A fashion designer.

39:59.716 --> 40:04.384
There is nothing wrong with it if he's actually
talented. But who's talented these days?

40:04.386 --> 40:06.920
If he was talented, he would
have done something already.

40:06.922 --> 40:09.156
You know what, remember
that stalker chick you had?

40:09.158 --> 40:10.824
- Yeah.
- She was talented, wasn't she?

40:10.826 --> 40:12.159
- Oh, yeah.
- Played the violin and shit.

40:12.161 --> 40:14.862
- She played seven instruments.
- Wow.

40:14.864 --> 40:16.066
But she was disturbed.

40:17.033 --> 40:18.433
How so?

40:18.435 --> 40:19.335
Legitimately.

40:20.703 --> 40:24.705
Like, I'm watching TV and a flyer
comes under the front door.

40:24.707 --> 40:27.708
I don't think anything of it. Like,
an hour later I'm in the kitchen

40:27.710 --> 40:31.411
and I notice it's not a flyer,
it's a picture of her naked.

40:31.413 --> 40:32.580
Oh.

40:32.582 --> 40:35.285
And on the bottom it's written
"miss me" in red lipstick.

40:36.185 --> 40:37.254
I mean, she played me in.

40:38.821 --> 40:40.955
That's not disturbing. I mean that's kind
of hot, if you ask me, I don't know.

40:40.957 --> 40:42.757
In a cheap red nylon
sort of way.

40:42.759 --> 40:46.096
- Which I like.
- I think that is kind of sexy, isn't it to you?

40:46.995 --> 40:48.362
What... what's that?

40:48.364 --> 40:49.830
Isn't it sexy?

40:49.832 --> 40:52.301
- Isn't what sexy?
- A passionate woman.

40:55.939 --> 40:59.140
Not as sexy as a man who can
bring out a woman's passion.

40:59.142 --> 41:00.042
Amen to that.

41:01.977 --> 41:04.180
Are you guys talking
about passionate women?

41:05.147 --> 41:09.085
Marcus and I have to join
Jennifer and Kathleen for a bit.

41:10.319 --> 41:13.054
Thank you for reminding
me to call Harold.

41:13.056 --> 41:14.224
Look, I'm sorry.

41:15.357 --> 41:19.794
I'm not angry. Just was
a very simple thing to do, okay?

41:19.796 --> 41:21.495
You're not that busy.

41:21.497 --> 41:23.464
- I'm sorry, okay?
- Right.

41:23.466 --> 41:24.498
Marcus.

41:24.500 --> 41:25.835
Yes.

41:28.872 --> 41:30.837
What the hell. God damn it.

41:30.839 --> 41:32.205
When did that happen?

41:32.207 --> 41:35.109
I don't know.
Maybe it's the energy.

41:35.111 --> 41:36.377
- Marcus.
- Yes.

41:36.379 --> 41:39.450
Why don't you join
us, man? Join us.

41:41.084 --> 41:44.886
That's it
before the first conversation.

41:44.888 --> 41:48.991
...The sensations are a result of
a massive misfire in the mind.

41:49.893 --> 41:52.225
Thank you. Hi.

41:52.227 --> 41:55.462
That's just the
latest Psychology Today pitch,

41:55.464 --> 41:58.799
proven yesterday,
disproven tomorrow.

41:58.801 --> 42:03.538
People keep experiencing it the same way,
that doesn't change the experiences.

42:03.540 --> 42:05.373
But people are morons.

42:05.375 --> 42:07.007
People can't help it.

42:07.009 --> 42:08.342
That's true.

42:08.344 --> 42:10.511
I'm just talking about an article
that I read that explains...

42:10.513 --> 42:11.446
Déjà vu.

42:11.448 --> 42:13.380
Oh, I love that.
I think it's fascinating.

42:13.382 --> 42:14.882
I heard this somewhere before.

42:14.884 --> 42:16.116
Yeah. Funny.

42:16.118 --> 42:17.851
He said it says.

42:17.853 --> 42:20.453
It's when you think
you saw something before

42:20.455 --> 42:23.056
but it's actually your brain
crossing wires.

42:23.058 --> 42:26.960
That's exactly right. It said they
created déjà vu by hypnotizing people

42:26.962 --> 42:29.397
to have amnesia
for an experiment.

42:29.399 --> 42:34.868
Most of those people had déjà vu because
they had actually experienced the situation

42:34.870 --> 42:36.469
before because of the test.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.605
And then they were
hypnotized to forget it.

42:38.607 --> 42:40.841
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah.

42:40.843 --> 42:45.045
So then they scanned the brains
of those people with an fMRI.

42:45.047 --> 42:49.216
Oh, I can't stand those machines. It's
like a... a tube and it vibrates.

42:49.218 --> 42:51.853
Ninety seconds and I freak out.

42:51.855 --> 42:56.489
This is actually a little different. You lay
down, you have like a... a goalie mask on.

42:56.491 --> 43:02.964
But what they showed was that déjà vu
happens in the pathways of your brain

43:02.966 --> 43:06.199
the paths of memory
and recognition cross

43:06.201 --> 43:10.071
and you're left
seeing a situation

43:10.073 --> 43:14.574
where the present is somehow
interlocked with a memory of the past.

43:14.576 --> 43:19.080
You're having like this... I don't know...
this supernatural premonition.

43:19.082 --> 43:20.413
That's crazy.

43:20.415 --> 43:23.317
Well, it does seem
crazy to think that.

43:23.319 --> 43:25.051
Sounds like a lot
of circular crap.

43:25.053 --> 43:27.955
- I like it. Go on.
- I think it's interesting.

43:27.957 --> 43:30.524
Well, you know what really
is interesting is jamais vu

43:30.526 --> 43:33.127
when you absolutely
can't remember something

43:33.129 --> 43:36.062
that you know you have done
numerous times before.

43:36.064 --> 43:38.966
That sounds pretty jamais vu.

43:38.968 --> 43:41.538
Yeah. It's French.
It means never seen.

43:44.406 --> 43:45.843
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

43:53.248 --> 43:54.151
Well,

43:55.484 --> 43:57.018
time will tell.

43:57.020 --> 43:58.286
Karma is a bitch.

43:58.288 --> 43:59.788
Everything happens
for a reason.

43:59.790 --> 44:04.357
Yeah. Don't let it distract you from
what you're currently working on.

44:04.359 --> 44:06.627
Yeah. You'll see it
very differently soon.

44:06.629 --> 44:07.897
You really will.

44:08.665 --> 44:10.534
It's God's will, I suppose.

44:11.634 --> 44:15.036
Yeah. Well, I guess
they let anyone in, huh.

44:15.038 --> 44:16.270
That's how...

44:16.272 --> 44:22.275
What? Waiter, another gimlet
for me and a round around.

44:22.277 --> 44:24.312
Yeah. Yes. Double.

44:24.314 --> 44:30.016
Look, I know, probably not what you want
to hear, but perception is reality.

44:30.018 --> 44:32.085
- What is reality?
- Perception is reality?

44:32.087 --> 44:34.290
Perception is reality.

44:38.962 --> 44:41.562
All right, where can a guy
take a piss around here?

44:41.564 --> 44:44.433
Well, I believe the
restroom is an option.

44:46.301 --> 44:50.603
I believe in creationism. That's
my confession to you, man.

44:50.605 --> 44:51.975
To creationism.

44:54.109 --> 44:57.013
I think I'm going to go check and
see when they are done, okay?

45:01.049 --> 45:02.218
It's not a good
work for them.

45:05.053 --> 45:06.289
I'd say fifty.

45:11.093 --> 45:12.929
And... and you?

45:15.064 --> 45:15.665
Me?

45:17.132 --> 45:18.167
What about me?

45:19.067 --> 45:20.236
What do you believe in?

45:21.303 --> 45:26.073
What do I believe in?
I believe in fairytales.

45:26.075 --> 45:28.511
Hm. How is that going for you?

45:29.712 --> 45:30.714
Frogs, mostly.

45:32.515 --> 45:33.583
A lot of frogs.

45:35.018 --> 45:37.286
I believe in one glass of wine.

45:40.622 --> 45:42.589
I'm drunk.

45:42.591 --> 45:45.394
Oh, it's fine.
It's just for a toast.

45:49.098 --> 45:50.167
To old friends.

45:51.267 --> 45:52.699
That's boring.

45:52.701 --> 45:54.004
To new friends.

45:54.803 --> 45:56.105
If you say so.

46:05.580 --> 46:06.415
What?

46:07.382 --> 46:08.651
Nothing. It's just...

46:10.553 --> 46:12.455
I feel like I heard it before.

46:14.457 --> 46:17.658
Well, what we toast to next?

46:17.660 --> 46:20.326
You really are trying
to get me drunk?

46:20.328 --> 46:24.330
No, just trying to get you to drink.
James... James, I was trying to get drunk.

46:24.332 --> 46:26.002
You did a very good job.

46:27.471 --> 46:31.675
I wasn't expecting to see him here.
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

46:33.276 --> 46:34.143
What?

46:36.611 --> 46:39.048
You remember when we
were smoking on the roof.

46:41.350 --> 46:46.520
Your sunglasses, the leopard print ones,
they fell on that old lady's head.

46:46.522 --> 46:47.657
Old lady?

46:54.363 --> 46:55.665
Let me show you something.

46:57.632 --> 46:59.468
- Come on.
- Okay.

47:10.779 --> 47:13.049
Hold on. I need a moment.

47:18.154 --> 47:19.189
You okay?

47:20.189 --> 47:21.190
Yeah.

47:23.593 --> 47:24.795
The wall is shaking.

48:31.393 --> 48:32.761
I think I should go.

48:33.930 --> 48:35.397
It was nice though.

48:55.651 --> 48:58.451
Get...
Get here now.

48:58.453 --> 48:59.455
Get here.

49:01.556 --> 49:02.890
Get here now.

49:02.892 --> 49:03.893
Hey.

49:11.866 --> 49:12.801
Excuse me.

49:13.835 --> 49:15.171
Have you seen a woman?

49:20.308 --> 49:21.477
Two of them, in fact.

49:23.613 --> 49:25.415
Don't tell me
you didn't see them.

49:27.984 --> 49:29.252
Have a good night.

51:40.982 --> 51:42.318
I thought I'd let you sleep.

51:52.093 --> 51:53.062
Look, if...

51:55.631 --> 52:00.737
if this meeting goes well, I
think we'll be good for a while.

52:03.172 --> 52:04.874
This Chinese fund is...

52:09.011 --> 52:09.846
Listen.

52:11.513 --> 52:12.481
I love you.

52:19.721 --> 52:20.957
I shouldn't have told you.

52:27.629 --> 52:30.032
Don't forget to call Harold
at seven-thirty.

52:33.835 --> 52:36.839
It's ten past eight,
but thank you.

53:29.924 --> 53:34.895
Andy, you're ten years old. You're like
my grandpa because you're really old.

53:34.897 --> 53:38.598
Andy is old, but Zeus is only
two. He's my little brother.

53:38.600 --> 53:39.866
Yeah? Which one is Andy?

53:39.868 --> 53:41.601
The old one, silly. This one.

53:41.603 --> 53:44.103
I see. Where are your patents?

53:44.105 --> 53:47.607
They're upstairs having dinner,
and they don't allow dogs.

53:47.609 --> 53:50.143
But I promised Andy and Zeus
that I wouldn't leave them.

53:50.145 --> 53:54.915
Mom has said I can walk them around the lobby
twenty-five times but my dad said thirty.

53:54.917 --> 53:59.118
And said to not get in anyone's way
and to get them if they have to pee.

53:59.120 --> 54:01.888
And then they gave me this.

54:01.890 --> 54:05.027
I see. And how many times have
they run around the lobby?

54:07.863 --> 54:10.998
- Four hundred fifty-two.
- Shhh!

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
I had to go both ways
because they got dizzy.

54:14.002 --> 54:16.870
I want to help.
But you should go up.

54:16.872 --> 54:20.007
I know. Zeus's going to be
older than me next year.

54:20.009 --> 54:21.141
Okay.

54:21.143 --> 54:22.775
You have pretty hair.

54:22.777 --> 54:24.911
Thank you. And what's your name?

54:24.913 --> 54:26.879
Emma. My tooth fell out.

54:26.881 --> 54:28.748
I can see that.

54:28.750 --> 54:30.953
Good night, Andy and Zeus.

54:32.587 --> 54:33.819
Bye!

54:33.821 --> 54:35.190
Nice to meet you.

55:01.951 --> 55:03.119
Are you okay?

55:07.256 --> 55:08.257
Yes.

55:11.225 --> 55:12.192
Do you need help?

55:12.194 --> 55:17.931
Oh, no, no. Go, go,
I do it. do it. Go, go.

55:17.933 --> 55:21.268
- Really, I could help.
- No. Go away.

55:21.270 --> 55:23.636
You stay here, I get in trouble.

55:23.638 --> 55:24.571
Go, go.

55:24.573 --> 55:27.576
You're a very nice woman.
Thank you. Go.

55:48.696 --> 55:50.232
So, what do you think?

55:52.134 --> 55:53.299
I don't know.

55:53.301 --> 55:55.002
Oh, you'll be fine.

55:55.004 --> 55:56.236
Thanks very much.
Keep the change.

55:56.238 --> 55:56.904
Thank you very much.

55:56.906 --> 55:58.241
I don't know how you do it.

56:00.743 --> 56:02.245
So many things can happen.

56:03.812 --> 56:06.915
They are happening right now.

56:08.017 --> 56:10.116
It's the ultimate ensemble.

56:10.118 --> 56:11.384
Sixties' band?

56:11.386 --> 56:14.222
No, and I think you
just made that up.

56:15.189 --> 56:16.857
I think you're right.

56:16.859 --> 56:17.759
It's a theory.

56:20.928 --> 56:23.332
You ever think about
your life being different?

56:24.700 --> 56:27.433
You know, like if you've been...
you're born in a different place

56:27.435 --> 56:32.938
or you developed different talents
when you're kid. It's funny.

56:32.940 --> 56:37.678
People are always thinking about all the
different paths their lives could have taken,

56:37.680 --> 56:42.415
parallel universes where
this lady is rich and famous

56:42.417 --> 56:45.284
and this guy discovers
the cure for cancer.

56:45.286 --> 56:49.056
We think about this stuff all the time,
right? Like a shadow, wherever you go.

56:49.058 --> 56:51.828
- So, you're a bartender...
- I also play the piano.

56:53.161 --> 56:54.928
Not right now you're not.

56:54.930 --> 56:55.897
I'm not?

56:59.201 --> 57:00.833
No.

57:00.835 --> 57:04.036
This reality, where
I'm the bartender

57:04.038 --> 57:08.977
and the reality where you are the bartender
are a lot closer than you think.

57:10.712 --> 57:13.716
So, there is a reality where I
don't take this gig and go home.

57:14.482 --> 57:16.882
Always unfolding.

57:16.884 --> 57:18.350
Always unfolding.

57:18.352 --> 57:21.254
What does all this new age shit have
to do with how you survive the job?

57:21.256 --> 57:24.056
Now I thought that would
have been obvious.

57:24.058 --> 57:25.894
A lot of people
come through here.

57:26.828 --> 57:30.065
As soon as you decide
who you are for them,

57:31.834 --> 57:32.835
you are dead.

58:34.228 --> 58:35.931
Seven-seven-two.

58:36.864 --> 58:38.931
I have one-six-four-eight.

58:38.933 --> 58:40.435
I have one-nine-seven-six.

58:42.571 --> 58:45.038
I got two-three-nine-two.

58:45.040 --> 58:47.174
One-six-six-four.

58:47.176 --> 58:48.878
I have one-seven-six-eight.

58:52.214 --> 58:53.980
I'll be right back.

58:53.982 --> 58:55.852
Come on man,
we got to finish this.

59:01.857 --> 59:05.991
And I can't convince him. I could try
but I'm like, fine, I'll sponsor one.

59:05.993 --> 59:08.495
He can live with me.
You got full visitation rights.

59:08.497 --> 59:09.830
You said you'll have it, right?

59:09.832 --> 59:11.431
Because it's about the love there,
it's not the responsibility.

59:11.433 --> 59:14.303
- How are you feeling, bro?
- Good. Thanks.

59:15.370 --> 59:19.308
So, you remember what you said to me that
one night? I'll never forget that, man.

59:21.343 --> 59:22.411
One second.

59:24.546 --> 59:25.781
Are you okay?

59:26.881 --> 59:28.415
Of course.

59:28.417 --> 59:31.317
Savannah cat, right.
Okay, that's a hybrid.

59:31.319 --> 59:33.319
But it's... it's a mix
between the cross-breed.

59:33.321 --> 59:37.924
So, it's... it's fine but it's
not light and I want them light.

59:40.261 --> 59:42.161
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

59:42.163 --> 59:43.462
I'm fine, I'm fine.
It's unbelievable.

59:43.464 --> 59:44.630
Are you okay?

59:44.632 --> 59:46.632
Yeah, the glass is chipped.

59:46.634 --> 59:49.069
The glass is... what do you
mean the glass is chipped?

59:49.071 --> 59:50.471
Take it easy.

59:50.473 --> 59:52.504
Holly shit. No, no, fuck that. The fuck...
the glass is... Waiter?

59:52.506 --> 59:53.505
- Sorry. You okay?
- I'm fine.

59:53.507 --> 59:56.109
Oh sir, are you okay?
He's fucking bleeding.

59:56.111 --> 59:59.879
I'm fine, okay? Just get me another glass.
Take it easy, Dave.

59:59.881 --> 01:00:01.281
- Take it easy Dave?
- Sir, if you'd just accompany me.

01:00:01.283 --> 01:00:02.449
Fuck that.

01:00:02.451 --> 01:00:05.317
Just... I'm... I'm fine. Just...

01:00:05.319 --> 01:00:07.453
I'm going to stay here.
Just sit down please, Dave.

01:00:07.455 --> 01:00:09.489
Sir, I just think it would be
better if you came with me.

01:00:09.491 --> 01:00:11.625
I prefer to stay here.
I prefer to stay here.

01:00:11.627 --> 01:00:14.426
Yes, sir, as you wish. Is there
anything else I can get for you?

01:00:14.428 --> 01:00:16.832
- Just another glass, please.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:18.667 --> 01:00:20.000
Actually, Macallan.

01:00:20.002 --> 01:00:22.301
The eighteen? Right away, sir.

01:00:22.303 --> 01:00:26.205
Un-fucking-real. I'm going
to destroy this place online.

01:00:26.207 --> 01:00:28.475
Oh, you're like
the rated reviewer.

01:00:28.477 --> 01:00:29.576
- Mm-Hm.
- Nice.

01:00:29.578 --> 01:00:32.645
Absolutely. You have
no idea what I'm going to do.

01:00:32.647 --> 01:00:36.082
Hey, you want to go to the
bathroom? You fixed up?

01:00:36.084 --> 01:00:38.317
No, no, I'm... I'm all set.

01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:39.488
Let me see.

01:00:51.033 --> 01:00:53.002
You know what I despise
about you most?

01:00:55.102 --> 01:00:57.038
What I will always, always hate?

01:01:00.575 --> 01:01:03.111
I don't know if you know
that you do this but

01:01:04.312 --> 01:01:05.480
every time you...

01:01:06.547 --> 01:01:09.149
you close the curtains
in the living room, you...

01:01:09.151 --> 01:01:11.116
you kind of

01:01:11.118 --> 01:01:13.652
stand with your hands
on your hips,

01:01:13.654 --> 01:01:17.893
and... and then you drop one
hip to the side like you're...

01:01:19.361 --> 01:01:21.330
like you're admiring
something, like...

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:26.401
like closing a curtain is some
kind of artistic statement or

01:01:28.035 --> 01:01:30.138
achievement
in interior design.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.542
I mean, what the fuck
are you so proud of?

01:01:41.582 --> 01:01:42.584
Is that all?

01:01:46.455 --> 01:01:47.989
You laugh like a little girl.

01:01:50.058 --> 01:01:52.395
Especially when you're
on the phone with your sister.

01:01:56.064 --> 01:01:57.600
Like a child.

01:02:25.493 --> 01:02:26.361
Well,

01:02:28.363 --> 01:02:29.698
I got to get back and

01:02:31.033 --> 01:02:33.201
finish this up.
I'll... I'll be done soon.

01:02:38.406 --> 01:02:39.441
I'll find it.

01:02:42.076 --> 01:02:46.379
Did Linda tell me that you took a piss
in the sink at Melting Clock, is that right?

01:02:46.381 --> 01:02:47.482
Linda wasn't even there.

01:02:50.152 --> 01:02:52.085
Seven-seven-two.

01:02:52.087 --> 01:02:53.652
I have
one-six-four-eight.

01:02:53.654 --> 01:02:55.290
I have
one-nine-seven-six.

01:02:57.325 --> 01:02:58.460
One-nine-seven-six.

01:03:00.294 --> 01:03:02.161
One-six-six-four.

01:03:02.163 --> 01:03:04.065
One-seven-six-eight.

01:03:08.169 --> 01:03:09.137
Here you are.

01:03:10.071 --> 01:03:11.670
Excuse me?

01:03:11.672 --> 01:03:13.475
What are you thinking
about right now?

01:03:15.509 --> 01:03:17.210
It's quite an approach.

01:03:17.212 --> 01:03:20.212
All to save the princess
from the enchanted forest.

01:03:20.214 --> 01:03:23.650
I'm sorry, but I think you're
thinking of someone else.

01:03:23.652 --> 01:03:25.284
You believe in fairytales?

01:03:25.286 --> 01:03:26.853
Of course I believe
in fairytales.

01:03:26.855 --> 01:03:28.788
And how is that
working out for you?

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:30.359
For me, it's frogs mostly.

01:03:31.259 --> 01:03:33.125
A lot of frogs.

01:03:33.127 --> 01:03:33.796
You?

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:37.565
- That's me in about ten minutes.
- What will happen then?

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.199
Depends.

01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:41.567
I have one-seven-six-eight.

01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:44.170
- Mm-Hm.
- One-two-six-nine.

01:03:44.172 --> 01:03:46.208
I have seven-two-seven-eight.

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:50.710
Excuse me.

01:03:50.712 --> 01:03:52.444
- Where are you...
- Excuse me.

01:03:52.446 --> 01:03:53.745
Excuse me.

01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:55.482
Excuse me.

01:03:55.484 --> 01:03:57.286
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.189
Excuse me. Pardon me.

01:04:40.495 --> 01:04:41.564
Fucking asshole!

01:04:56.745 --> 01:04:57.712
Excuse me, sir.

01:04:58.946 --> 01:05:00.548
Do you have
an extra cigarette?

01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:03.783
Sure.

01:05:03.785 --> 01:05:05.187
- Thanks.
- Of course.

01:05:06.321 --> 01:05:07.323
There you go.

01:05:19.433 --> 01:05:20.699
Thanks again.

01:05:20.701 --> 01:05:21.870
No worry.

01:07:15.817 --> 01:07:16.986
There you go, sir.

01:07:19.921 --> 01:07:20.855
Thanks.

01:07:29.064 --> 01:07:30.699
It can get busy tonight.

01:07:32.567 --> 01:07:33.602
Yes, sir.

01:07:37.605 --> 01:07:39.875
Crowds around this time here
get pretty interesting.

01:07:40.808 --> 01:07:42.477
Pretty interesting.

01:07:44.745 --> 01:07:46.745
I can't complain though.

01:07:46.747 --> 01:07:49.550
Keeps me busy. It's better
than being bored. Right?

01:07:52.786 --> 01:07:54.390
You should have seen
the other night.

01:07:56.123 --> 01:07:59.926
These two blondes come
in, wow, I mean wow,

01:07:59.928 --> 01:08:04.465
legs for days, had that sunny type
skin, you know what I'm talking about?

01:08:05.934 --> 01:08:06.702
Yeah.

01:08:07.669 --> 01:08:08.737
I'm Bill, by the way.

01:08:12.773 --> 01:08:13.575
You ever...

01:08:14.675 --> 01:08:18.446
ever get the feeling, Bill,
like... like maybe you...

01:08:21.616 --> 01:08:24.752
feeling like you've never
been to a place before but

01:08:26.153 --> 01:08:27.589
you know that you have?

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.627
No, sir, I can't say I'm familiar
with that particular feeling.

01:08:34.895 --> 01:08:36.031
So, these blondes,

01:08:38.099 --> 01:08:41.533
I noticed them come in
but I get busy pouring.

01:08:41.536 --> 01:08:45.341
Next thing I know, I hear
a loud crash. I look up,

01:08:46.107 --> 01:08:49.345
they're going at each
other like pit bulls.

01:08:51.645 --> 01:08:52.947
Here's the best part.

01:12:23.157 --> 01:12:24.760
<i>Emma, where are you?</i>
