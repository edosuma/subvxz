ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.958
ANY SIMILARITY TO ACTUAL EVENTS,
PERSONS, OR ORGANIZATIONS

00:10.041 --> 00:10.916
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

00:44.125 --> 00:45.458
I'll see you later.

00:48.291 --> 00:49.208
Okay.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.541
Bye. Let's go, Tee.

00:51.625 --> 00:52.458
Yes, sir.

01:20.916 --> 01:21.875
I suggest

01:22.666 --> 01:24.500
you think about it carefully, Thida.

01:24.583 --> 01:25.750
Thank you, Doctor.

01:41.708 --> 01:44.541
Do you realize
you're going to get us both in trouble?

01:45.291 --> 01:46.125
With Mr. Wat?

01:53.583 --> 01:54.416
I saw you.

01:55.833 --> 01:57.583
Now I understand what you said before

01:57.666 --> 01:59.541
about you being Jo's problem.

02:00.208 --> 02:01.583
Is it because my brother

02:01.666 --> 02:03.166
was involved with someone's mistress?

02:06.791 --> 02:09.041
Don't talk nonsense
when you don't know anything.

02:16.416 --> 02:18.375
Jo and I were in love.

02:21.333 --> 02:24.583
He was planning
to take me away to start a new life.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.958
So my brother wanted my help

02:29.666 --> 02:31.125
to get you away?

02:32.833 --> 02:33.833
Me…

02:38.083 --> 02:39.291
and our baby.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.333
-Hello, Mr. Wat.
-Hello, Doctor.

02:48.416 --> 02:49.916
How is she? Are you all done?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.833
Yes, we're all done.
It's just seasonal allergies.

02:54.666 --> 02:55.791
Is it Jo's baby?

02:55.875 --> 02:56.958
Wanchai.

02:57.041 --> 02:58.625
I think you should leave now.

02:59.250 --> 03:00.625
Mr. Wat is picking me up.

03:00.708 --> 03:02.833
He doesn't know
why I was seeing the doctor.

03:02.916 --> 03:03.750
I'm not afraid.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.166
Please don't do this.

03:07.291 --> 03:09.791
You don't know what he is capable of.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.708
I want to talk to him and sort it out.

03:12.375 --> 03:14.500
-But if you don't go now--
-Thida.

03:15.541 --> 03:16.583
There you are.

03:17.166 --> 03:18.875
What are you doing?

03:18.958 --> 03:21.500
I hope you're hungry

03:21.583 --> 03:23.208
because I'm starving.

03:23.875 --> 03:26.041
-Come on, let's get Japanese today.
-Okay.

03:26.125 --> 03:29.666
I want to eat salted salmon

03:30.500 --> 03:31.541
and…

04:58.458 --> 04:59.375
Hey, Em.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.083
Shit, what did you do?

05:02.125 --> 05:02.958
I came off.

05:05.291 --> 05:06.458
It's not that bad.

05:07.291 --> 05:08.291
I can fix it.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.458
Leave it here. I'll fix it.
I'll take it to your place tomorrow.

05:12.291 --> 05:13.416
You can take

05:14.125 --> 05:15.083
that one for now.

05:16.583 --> 05:17.541
Thank you.

05:36.375 --> 05:37.791
Wait, not that one.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.750
Mr. Wat only asks you to do simple things.

06:09.833 --> 06:11.625
Like getting rid of that nosy reporter.

06:12.250 --> 06:15.333
You even messed that up
and made me look stupid.

06:36.125 --> 06:36.958
Hey.

06:38.583 --> 06:40.083
Okay.

06:41.625 --> 06:42.458
Hey, Aod.

06:44.666 --> 06:45.500
What's wrong?

06:48.416 --> 06:49.583
I can trust you, can't I?

06:50.541 --> 06:52.500
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

06:53.916 --> 06:55.208
The job for Hardcore…

06:56.041 --> 06:57.125
I'm going to quit.

06:58.208 --> 07:00.291
You said that like you have a choice.

07:01.208 --> 07:02.541
Not afraid of another beating?

07:04.000 --> 07:04.958
What about your parents?

07:06.166 --> 07:07.416
If I keep giving in to him,

07:08.958 --> 07:10.666
I'll end up like Jo.

07:12.291 --> 07:13.250
What do you mean?

07:14.583 --> 07:15.458
What do you know?

07:17.541 --> 07:18.416
That's the problem.

07:20.250 --> 07:22.875
I will never know the truth.

07:24.833 --> 07:25.833
JAITHAM FOUNDATION

07:25.916 --> 07:28.250
Shit, Sak is here.

07:29.041 --> 07:30.875
The beer, Chai.

07:40.666 --> 07:43.666
So what brings you here
under the expressway today?

07:43.750 --> 07:44.916
Is something going on?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.625
Phen was in a good mood today.

07:48.208 --> 07:49.750
She got up early to make dumplings.

07:49.833 --> 07:52.041
She made extra.

07:52.125 --> 07:54.583
-Good, I'm hungry.
-Help yourself, Aod.

07:55.416 --> 07:56.791
Thank you so much.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.791
-You reek of beer.
-Cheep.

08:15.791 --> 08:17.125
About what Pratheep said…

08:18.166 --> 08:19.000
Chai.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.291
Jo is dead.

08:23.083 --> 08:26.041
Whatever he did, it doesn't matter.

08:28.333 --> 08:31.333
What matters are
the people who are still alive.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.541
What if it was Jo's fault

08:37.416 --> 08:38.500
you got arrested?

08:40.333 --> 08:41.916
It's all in the past.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.041
Let's make the most of today.

08:53.416 --> 08:54.250
Okay.

09:02.791 --> 09:04.041
Hey, there's a car crash.

09:04.125 --> 09:05.375
-Hey, hurry.
-Hurry up.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.125
Help me watch out for cars.

09:07.208 --> 09:08.583
Come help the injured person!

09:09.458 --> 09:10.291
Hey.

09:11.625 --> 09:14.500
-Can you hear me?
-He has no pulse.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.666
-Aod, call for an ambulance.
-Okay.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.250
This is Jaitham. Code 15, code 40.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.791
Two people are injured and unconscious.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.333
The location is the ring road,
Pattanakarn.

09:25.416 --> 09:26.666
Send an advanced ambulance.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.000
Start CPR.

09:30.166 --> 09:31.000
Wake up.

09:32.375 --> 09:33.208
-Chai.
-Wake up.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.375
Come on, stay alive.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.375
Most importantly,

09:45.041 --> 09:46.666
we only have four minutes.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.333
Four golden minutes

09:48.416 --> 09:50.333
<i>before the patient
suffers cerebral infarction.</i>

09:52.833 --> 09:53.666
How is he?

09:55.875 --> 09:56.791
He has a pulse.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.500
Hey, kid, you did well.

09:59.541 --> 10:02.333
Hang in there. The ambulance is coming.

10:02.416 --> 10:03.250
Help him, please.

10:03.791 --> 10:04.666
Come on, you can do it.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.208
I got a pulse.

10:20.541 --> 10:21.625
I HAVE A SPECIAL JOB FOR YOU.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.000
It's strange.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.708
This is all there is about Babylon.

10:29.208 --> 10:30.291
Even though it was

10:30.791 --> 10:32.458
this huge megaproject.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.750
Information about it seemed
to disappear all of a sudden.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.875
Muay's source

10:38.708 --> 10:40.750
said that we need to search for Babylon,

10:40.833 --> 10:42.666
so shouldn't there be more to it?

10:43.708 --> 10:46.291
We can't even find Babylon's location.

10:48.708 --> 10:50.541
It was probably just a pipe dream.

10:52.208 --> 10:53.541
It died before it even began.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.875
They promoted it once
or twice then called it quits.

10:57.041 --> 11:00.250
They probably just set it up
to get funding from the government.

11:01.291 --> 11:03.291
Wat is always coming up with new projects.

11:04.083 --> 11:06.625
His Songkran campaign is way over-the-top.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.000
Hey.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.375
There's a library at Matimuanchon, right?

11:14.458 --> 11:15.291
Yes.

11:16.833 --> 11:18.791
If that asshole Artorn

11:19.416 --> 11:20.875
hasn't torn it down yet.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.875
Let's go, then.

11:23.958 --> 11:25.083
Wait for me in the car.

11:25.166 --> 11:27.000
I'll get changed and be right there.

11:27.625 --> 11:28.458
Okay.

11:28.958 --> 11:29.791
Hurry up.

11:39.458 --> 11:42.375
-Go.
-Let's go.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.333
This is yours, right?

11:52.791 --> 11:53.625
Thank you.

12:07.458 --> 12:12.208
HC: I HAVE A SPECIAL JOB FOR YOU, HONEY

12:17.666 --> 12:20.125
JAITHAM FOUNDATION

12:20.208 --> 12:23.000
What the hell is this job?
Why is he only telling us now?

12:23.583 --> 12:24.416
Fuck.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.250
I know. It's strange.
It's different this time.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.666
They're here.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.625
Do you think
they can see us from the plane?

12:49.500 --> 12:50.333
Looks the same.

12:52.291 --> 12:54.458
-Hey, you two, come out.
-Yes, sir.

12:55.291 --> 12:56.125
Hey, wait.

12:57.166 --> 12:58.375
Ten minutes, tops.

13:03.833 --> 13:05.708
MATIMUANCHON

13:17.958 --> 13:19.250
Where is it?

13:27.083 --> 13:28.041
Did you have a good dream?

13:28.750 --> 13:29.583
Yes.

13:30.666 --> 13:31.500
Hey.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.083
There's nothing about Babylon.

13:34.791 --> 13:36.250
The project must have folded.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.458
Of course, it did.

13:37.958 --> 13:39.791
But it would be weird
if there were no news.

13:41.416 --> 13:42.250
I'm hungry.

13:43.291 --> 13:44.208
Let's come back later.

13:44.833 --> 13:46.208
Come on, just a second.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.083
I'm almost done.

13:48.625 --> 13:49.791
Please, just a second.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.375
I found it!

14:01.458 --> 14:04.791
Babylon, the smart city park project.

14:05.916 --> 14:07.625
I've found the address. Let's go see it.

14:17.208 --> 14:18.500
What the hell is this?

14:19.791 --> 14:21.333
Let's get it down.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.166
Hey.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.083
Shit.

14:42.416 --> 14:43.708
Fuck.

14:51.666 --> 14:53.375
Damn, my hands are shaking.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.291
Chai, look.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.666
Fuck, I'm about to throw up.

15:05.625 --> 15:06.458
Help me.

15:11.958 --> 15:13.625
How smart. Shit.

15:14.708 --> 15:16.125
Holy shit.

15:32.083 --> 15:32.916
Let's take a look.

15:39.916 --> 15:42.416
Here, it's out. Pack it.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.250
Hurry up. The customers are waiting.

16:10.125 --> 16:10.958
Here's the money.

16:19.958 --> 16:20.791
Hurry up.

16:30.416 --> 16:31.291
Come on, hurry up.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.791
JAITHAM FOUNDATION

17:07.958 --> 17:09.583
-What are you all doing back here?
-Yeah.

17:10.250 --> 17:11.625
I don't know. My dad told me to come.

17:13.250 --> 17:14.500
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:35.791 --> 17:37.458
Shit.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.166
What is this money?

17:46.083 --> 17:47.208
Tell everyone

17:47.291 --> 17:48.625
what this money is!

17:50.583 --> 17:51.666
What do you mean?

17:51.750 --> 17:53.250
You're fucking pathetic.

17:54.041 --> 17:56.250
You can't even admit it like a man.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.291
Do I have to tell you

18:07.875 --> 18:09.000
how I feel right now?

18:09.083 --> 18:10.000
<i>Here's the money.</i>

18:16.041 --> 18:17.583
I loved you like family.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.166
I trusted you with everything.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.833
But you're just like Pratheep.

18:26.916 --> 18:28.708
You play the part of honest men,

18:30.250 --> 18:33.125
but it turns out you're just criminals
who use rescue work as a front.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.041
I'm glad you're here.

18:47.916 --> 18:48.750
Here's the proof.

18:53.083 --> 18:54.083
A corrupt network

18:54.958 --> 18:56.750
hidden in rescue foundations.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.291
Aod and Wanchai are part of it.

19:00.583 --> 19:01.875
I'm an idiot

19:01.958 --> 19:03.083
for trusting you two.

19:08.750 --> 19:09.625
Sak.

19:09.708 --> 19:11.833
Sak, calm down. Hear me out.

19:11.916 --> 19:13.166
-Stop talking, Aod.
-Sak.

19:14.666 --> 19:17.083
I knew about your history in prison.

19:18.583 --> 19:20.041
I thought you could change.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.125
Criminals like you

19:23.708 --> 19:24.958
don't change, do they?

19:29.375 --> 19:30.375
Shit.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.458
I don't have to tell you, do I?

19:40.666 --> 19:42.083
Jaitham Foundation…

19:46.250 --> 19:47.541
doesn't need criminals like you two.

19:49.625 --> 19:51.666
Have your excuses ready for the police.

19:53.625 --> 19:54.875
I'll show them the video.

19:54.958 --> 19:56.791
Hey, Sak, calm down.

19:56.875 --> 19:58.750
-Let's not report it.
-Stay out of it!

19:59.541 --> 20:01.666
Do you think they did nothing wrong?

20:03.125 --> 20:03.958
Sak.

20:04.791 --> 20:06.541
Maybe it's time for you to accept

20:08.000 --> 20:09.583
that volunteer rescuers

20:09.666 --> 20:11.958
don't make enough money to live on.

20:12.041 --> 20:12.875
So?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.625
Does that mean you can use
the rescue van to move drugs?

20:17.250 --> 20:18.583
Everyone has their own problems.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.083
We all have our reasons.

20:20.166 --> 20:21.750
Do you think I don't know that?

20:23.625 --> 20:25.833
You all know my family well.

20:27.041 --> 20:28.916
Everyone has problems.

20:30.833 --> 20:32.791
-Actually, Bua and I--
-Bua, Pipo,

20:33.416 --> 20:34.666
don't say anything else.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.875
-Sak.
-Chai.

20:53.166 --> 20:54.000
All right, Sak.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.333
-All right.
-Aod.

20:57.333 --> 20:58.458
Aod, calm down.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.291
Are you just going to leave like that?

21:24.625 --> 21:26.083
Don't you owe me an explanation?

21:29.458 --> 21:30.833
I have no excuse, Kat.

21:32.750 --> 21:33.875
I did it.

21:34.583 --> 21:35.416
It's all over.

21:35.958 --> 21:37.958
We can expose the network together.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.250
You can start over.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.208
I just found out something new.
Let's look into it together.

21:44.750 --> 21:45.583
Kat.

21:47.166 --> 21:48.291
It's not that simple.

21:54.166 --> 21:56.250
That's because you're
a coward and you're selfish.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.208
What I said about us being a team…

22:08.875 --> 22:09.875
forget about it.

24:32.291 --> 24:33.125
Hey.

24:44.958 --> 24:46.125
It really exists.

24:47.291 --> 24:48.291
Babylon.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.083
Kat.

24:53.583 --> 24:55.500
Hey, is this Babylon or a haunted house?

24:56.291 --> 24:57.125
Do we have to go in?

24:57.208 --> 24:59.333
We can come back during the day.

Look, that's a Ruampalangjai van.

25:10.250 --> 25:11.083
You're right.

25:13.416 --> 25:14.416
What should we do now?

25:17.458 --> 25:21.791
Hey, answer me.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.583
Why is she in such a hurry?

25:30.083 --> 25:31.083
Wait for me.

25:51.583 --> 25:52.416
Hey.

25:53.416 --> 25:57.250
Mr. Wat seems stressed out
these days because of that reporter.

25:58.416 --> 26:01.666
It's because your men can't even
stop a little girl like that from talking.

26:01.750 --> 26:04.416
-I already took care of that asshole.
-Holy shit.

26:04.500 --> 26:07.166
What is this?

26:13.583 --> 26:14.958
Hey, Kat.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.875
Hey, make sure to grill it thoroughly.

26:17.958 --> 26:19.416
-Got it.
-Okay.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.458
Is it good? I forgot to ask.

26:21.958 --> 26:23.375
-It's good.
-It's from the corpse.

26:23.458 --> 26:24.291
What?

26:25.541 --> 26:26.375
Wait.

26:27.291 --> 26:31.208
-Let's go. Come on.
-Where are you going?

26:32.958 --> 26:33.958
Cheers.

26:37.250 --> 26:38.458
This is too dangerous.

26:42.833 --> 26:44.791
Why is Mr. Wat so afraid of that reporter

26:44.875 --> 26:46.333
that he has to have her killed?

26:46.416 --> 26:50.000
Don't you guys know
the idiom "nip it in the bud"?

26:53.916 --> 26:56.458
If you guys can't do it,
why don't we do it for you?

26:56.541 --> 26:58.500
Don't you dare disrespect me, asshole.

27:00.375 --> 27:01.958
Just shoot him in the mouth.

27:04.916 --> 27:05.750
Damn it!

27:06.708 --> 27:09.208
How many times have I told you?
This stuff is expensive?

27:09.791 --> 27:11.541
Be careful with it.

27:11.625 --> 27:13.666
-Motherfucker.
-I'm sorry.

27:14.666 --> 27:16.916
-Do you want a beating?
-Please don't.

27:17.666 --> 27:19.083
If you do it again,

27:19.708 --> 27:21.666
I'll beat you to a pulp.

27:21.750 --> 27:24.041
You don't get paid today.

27:24.125 --> 27:26.541
-The rest of you, get to work.
-Why are you filming?

27:26.625 --> 27:30.833
Haven't I told you already?
Be careful when you're handling the stuff.

27:30.916 --> 27:31.750
Damn it!

27:32.458 --> 27:33.458
Let's eat some more.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.041
Kat.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.833
What's all that banging?

27:58.708 --> 28:01.041
Shit, I'm about to pass out.

<i>The job is done.</i>

can't deliver the money today.</i>

31:15.333 --> 31:17.458
Is there a problem? You can tell me.

31:17.541 --> 31:19.083
Sak is holding a training session,

31:20.083 --> 31:21.625
and all the money is at the foundation.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.208
We have to wait for the right time.

31:29.250 --> 31:30.500
Just don't take too long.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.708
Otherwise, you'll get depressed.

31:37.666 --> 31:38.500
Hey.

31:39.125 --> 31:40.333
Are you sure this is a good idea?

31:42.958 --> 31:44.583
Would you rather be his slave forever?

31:47.791 --> 31:48.625
You have a point.

31:49.666 --> 31:50.708
All right.

31:56.208 --> 31:57.041
I'll give you extra.

31:58.666 --> 31:59.916
For our friendship.

32:01.958 --> 32:02.791
Take it.

32:04.500 --> 32:05.416
Thank you.

32:06.500 --> 32:07.333
I'm counting on you.

32:10.458 --> 32:13.583
I'll try, but I can't
guarantee it'll work.

32:13.666 --> 32:14.958
Thanks anyway.

32:17.833 --> 32:18.791
Here we are.

32:19.541 --> 32:22.208
They say when you work together
as buddies in rescue work,

32:22.708 --> 32:25.500
you become buddies in real life.

32:26.916 --> 32:28.083
Who said that?

32:28.708 --> 32:29.541
Well…

32:31.208 --> 32:32.041
It was Sak.

32:33.333 --> 32:34.166
Come on.

32:36.125 --> 32:36.958
All right.

32:37.708 --> 32:38.541
I'll keep you posted.

32:43.291 --> 32:44.416
Good luck.

32:50.250 --> 32:51.083
See you.

33:23.333 --> 33:25.291
Kat, wait.

33:25.958 --> 33:27.375
Hold on, Kat.

33:27.458 --> 33:28.291
Kat.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.041
Kat.

33:31.958 --> 33:33.125
Hey, wait.

33:33.708 --> 33:36.208
Kat, shouldn't we go to the police?

33:36.833 --> 33:39.250
You heard them. He might be
the one who ordered to have me killed.

33:39.958 --> 33:42.375
I think Wat is behind it all.

33:42.458 --> 33:43.750
-I'll ask him straight out.
-What?

33:43.833 --> 33:45.166
Let's see what he has to say.

33:47.833 --> 33:49.458
-Excuse me.
-All right.

33:49.541 --> 33:50.791
You can't park there.

33:50.875 --> 33:52.541
-I know.
-Do you have an appointment?

33:53.125 --> 33:55.833
Right now, I'm in front of Wattanakarn,

33:55.916 --> 33:58.500

33:59.125 --> 34:00.500
<i>The reason I'm here</i>

34:01.125 --> 34:02.458
<i>is to see Mr. Wat.</i>

34:04.166 --> 34:06.541
You need to get permission.
You can't film here.

34:07.166 --> 34:08.083
Please move your car.

34:08.166 --> 34:09.416
Sure.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.625
Please move your car.

34:10.708 --> 34:12.333
-Please stay clear.
-A company van is here.

34:14.625 --> 34:17.333
-Please move your car.
-Okay.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.708
-Take care of my car.
-Hey.

34:22.041 --> 34:24.125
Kat! Hey!

34:24.208 --> 34:27.250
-Hey, ma'am, you can't go in there.
-Kat! Hey.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.916
-What should I do?
-Ma'am.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.125
-Ma'am.
-Hey, ma'am.

34:31.208 --> 34:33.333
You can't go in, ma'am.

34:41.333 --> 34:42.541
Hey, move.

34:57.916 --> 34:58.750
Kwan.

34:59.541 --> 35:02.000
-Yes?
-Let's use cheaper material.

35:02.083 --> 35:03.125
What do you think?

35:03.208 --> 35:04.041
Can we do that?

35:04.583 --> 35:05.541
-Sir.
-Yes?

35:05.625 --> 35:07.916
If you do that, it'll be dangerous.

35:09.333 --> 35:10.875
What's the big deal, Kwan?

35:10.958 --> 35:12.833
I've already won the contract.

35:28.416 --> 35:31.166
Reduce the quality. Don't worry.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.333
-Okay.
-Okay?

35:34.875 --> 35:37.083
-Sir, I'll call security.
-No, it's okay.

35:37.708 --> 35:40.125
It's okay, guys.
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

35:40.958 --> 35:44.000
I'm inside Wattanakarn now, everyone.

35:47.208 --> 35:48.541
<i>Hello, Ms. Kat.</i>

35:48.625 --> 35:50.541
This is a surprise.

35:50.625 --> 35:53.708
It's such an honor that Kat

35:53.791 --> 35:55.250
<i>has joined us by trespassing</i>

35:55.875 --> 35:57.625
<i>on my property.</i>

35:58.250 --> 35:59.458
I have proof today.

36:00.666 --> 36:02.250
Your girl is at it again.

36:03.208 --> 36:04.416
<i>What proof, Kat?</i>

36:05.083 --> 36:07.166
<i>I have proof that you run
an underground business</i>

36:07.875 --> 36:11.541
<i>making illegal goods
with a well-known rescue foundation.</i>

36:12.250 --> 36:13.708
<i>And you might have
tried to have me killed.</i>

36:15.333 --> 36:16.458
Do you know where I got that from?

36:18.000 --> 36:18.833
Babylon.

36:20.291 --> 36:22.958
You remember
the Babylon project, don't you?

36:23.875 --> 36:25.083
What are you talking about?

<i>Don't you guys know

36:35.958 --> 36:37.041
Mr. Artorn.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
That's Mr. Wat.

36:39.083 --> 36:41.875
<i>Mr. Wat, please tell everyone
if all of this is true.</i>

36:41.958 --> 36:44.708
<i>Ms. Kat, you're talking nonsense.</i>

36:44.791 --> 36:47.458
<i>I will have my secretary
call the police right now.</i>

36:48.541 --> 36:49.375
MATIMUANCHON

36:54.541 --> 36:55.375
What's going on?

36:56.000 --> 36:57.041
How could this happen?

36:57.125 --> 36:58.833
Well, Wee did it.

36:58.916 --> 36:59.958
Take it off.

37:00.041 --> 37:01.791
-Yes, sir.
-Take it off right now!

37:05.416 --> 37:06.833
Hold on.

37:08.041 --> 37:09.250
Kat.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.541
<i>I'll give you a chance.</i>

37:12.166 --> 37:13.916
<i>It's your one and only chance.</i>

37:14.666 --> 37:16.958
Please apologize to me

37:17.041 --> 37:20.791
and anyone else you have mentioned

37:21.625 --> 37:23.041
on this live stream right now.

37:26.208 --> 37:27.125
In your dreams.

37:31.875 --> 37:32.958
No!

37:35.833 --> 37:37.083
Fuck you!

37:39.208 --> 37:41.083
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am, stop.

37:41.166 --> 37:42.333
Stop, ma'am.

37:43.750 --> 37:44.833
Hey, ma'am.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.500
Ma'am.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.541
That night,

39:07.375 --> 39:09.750
he was with me before he went to see you.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.791
But for my own safety,

39:14.291 --> 39:15.708
Jo never told me anything.

39:17.958 --> 39:18.791
Wanchai.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.333
You can be sure

39:23.666 --> 39:25.833
that Jo did everything
with good intentions.

39:32.166 --> 39:34.750
Even when he did something bad.

39:37.541 --> 39:38.375
Look at this.

39:39.583 --> 39:41.541
We had a photo taken together.

39:50.208 --> 39:52.958
But he tore it up for my safety.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.791
I got the money
to help you get away from Wat.

39:58.416 --> 39:59.375
You should get away first.

40:00.541 --> 40:03.041
Then I'll find a way
to help you and your baby.

40:09.125 --> 40:11.666
I admire your optimism.

40:13.833 --> 40:15.083
It's a shame

40:15.833 --> 40:17.291
I can't think that way too.

40:20.166 --> 40:23.083
I'm just a woman
who's lucky with her looks.

40:25.250 --> 40:27.291
But it's like a cage
that keeps me trapped.

40:30.375 --> 40:33.791
<i>You can probably guess
how I became his mistress, right?</i>

40:35.083 --> 40:37.708
<i>I used my looks to make money.</i>

40:38.750 --> 40:41.625
<i>Then I became an escort
and had an agent who got me clients.</i>

40:45.666 --> 40:48.250
<i>He liked me enough
to give me a special status.</i>

40:49.666 --> 40:50.791
That's why I'm telling you

40:52.458 --> 40:54.625
that I can't leave this life.

40:55.166 --> 40:57.750
This is where I belong.

40:59.833 --> 41:01.833
But you're pregnant with Jo's baby.

41:02.583 --> 41:03.750
I'm that kid's uncle.

41:05.541 --> 41:07.416
-I'll take care of you and the baby.
-Sorry.

41:12.833 --> 41:14.166
I'm getting rid of it.

41:15.083 --> 41:16.500
Are you crazy, Thida?

41:16.583 --> 41:17.875
You can't do that.

41:18.958 --> 41:21.333
I'll take care of it.
I can take care of it.

41:21.416 --> 41:24.166
If he finds out,
he won't spare me and the baby.

41:26.041 --> 41:27.625
I don't want any more trouble.

41:29.750 --> 41:31.291
Is it really Jo's baby?

41:40.250 --> 41:41.250
Of course.

41:44.791 --> 41:47.166
Anyone would ask that same question.

41:52.458 --> 41:54.208
But Jo never doubted me.

42:00.041 --> 42:01.625
Jo was all I had.

42:03.041 --> 42:04.083
What about Wat?

42:06.916 --> 42:08.708
He lost the ability
to have children long ago.

42:09.583 --> 42:10.416
He had a vasectomy.

42:11.625 --> 42:12.458
Besides,

42:13.541 --> 42:16.208
do you really think someone like him
would spread his seed around?

42:17.541 --> 42:20.541
His only son gives him
enough of a headache.

42:24.083 --> 42:24.916
His only son?

42:27.750 --> 42:29.666
I mean his youngest son.

42:31.250 --> 42:34.541
The one he always talks about,
who died in an accident,

42:35.166 --> 42:36.208
was his eldest son.

42:37.208 --> 42:38.875
He has only one son left now.

42:50.583 --> 42:51.416
Thida?

43:04.291 --> 43:05.791
Are you in the bedroom?

43:13.500 --> 43:15.416
You must be in here.

43:23.625 --> 43:25.416
-Thida.
-Oh, hi.

43:26.250 --> 43:29.458
When did you get here?
I didn't hear you come in.

43:40.500 --> 43:43.041
CALLING KAT

43:48.958 --> 43:51.041
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WATTANAKARN
AND VOLUNTEER RESCUERS

44:02.416 --> 44:05.333
POST

44:15.916 --> 44:20.666
<i>Sorry, the number
you have dialed is currently unavailable.</i>

44:25.000 --> 44:26.833
Hi, honey.

44:27.791 --> 44:29.375
Let's go for a drive.

44:32.041 --> 44:33.333
Hey, stop.

44:34.041 --> 44:35.833
-I said stop!
-Stop right now!

44:47.958 --> 44:49.166
Thida.

44:49.250 --> 44:50.208
Tell me.

44:50.875 --> 44:53.375
You're pregnant, aren't you?

44:53.458 --> 44:54.750
Are you pregnant?

44:55.666 --> 44:57.083
I'm not.

44:57.666 --> 44:59.041
I'm not pregnant.

44:59.791 --> 45:01.166
Look at this then.

45:03.958 --> 45:04.833
Who is this?

45:06.083 --> 45:07.250
Who is this, Thida?

45:12.708 --> 45:13.958
You cheated on me.

45:15.791 --> 45:18.041
You cheated on me!

45:19.500 --> 45:20.750
Do you think I'm stupid?

45:22.166 --> 45:24.333
Bringing that asshole into my condo.

45:24.416 --> 45:27.666
If I had set up the camera earlier,
I would have known about Jo.

45:30.333 --> 45:31.166
Please.

45:34.833 --> 45:36.041
Don't.

45:56.500 --> 45:57.333
Let's go.

46:06.375 --> 46:07.208
Hey.

46:09.208 --> 46:10.166
Go. Move.

46:14.333 --> 46:16.291
I'm counting on you today.

46:16.375 --> 46:17.208
Two bodies.

46:47.333 --> 46:49.208
It won't hurt. Don't be afraid.

46:49.875 --> 46:51.166
One hit, just a little sting.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Wait for my boss
to give you a speech first.

46:56.083 --> 46:58.791
I promise I'll send you off in peace.

46:58.875 --> 47:00.916
It'll be a first-class journey.

47:04.250 --> 47:05.166
Please.

47:08.083 --> 47:09.708
I'm sorry.

47:09.791 --> 47:11.750
Don't do anything to me, please.

47:12.583 --> 47:14.166
Come on. Stop talking.

47:14.250 --> 47:16.666
-Come on.
-I don't want to die.

47:17.958 --> 47:19.333
Please don't hurt me.

47:25.708 --> 47:28.083
This is so much fun. I love it.

47:39.458 --> 47:41.416
Many people have disappointed me

47:42.750 --> 47:44.166
in my life.

47:47.166 --> 47:48.583
But the first place

47:50.083 --> 47:51.000
goes to you.

47:52.583 --> 47:53.416
Right.

47:54.083 --> 47:55.125
I forgot about Jo.

47:57.666 --> 47:59.708
But he already got what he deserved.

48:00.583 --> 48:01.958
Jo didn't die by accident, did he?

48:04.541 --> 48:05.708
I'm sorry, Wanchai.

48:09.791 --> 48:11.583
I shouldn't have contacted you.

48:13.333 --> 48:14.291
Wanchai.

48:17.708 --> 48:18.791
Your brother is dead.

48:20.583 --> 48:21.916
You'll die soon too.

48:23.916 --> 48:25.500
And your parents?

48:26.958 --> 48:28.291
They'll follow right behind.

48:29.750 --> 48:30.666
Fuck you!

48:32.291 --> 48:33.208
Damn it.

48:33.291 --> 48:34.291
Wanchai.

48:36.416 --> 48:37.375
Stop!

48:37.458 --> 48:38.791
Stop! Please!

48:40.875 --> 48:42.958
Please stop!

48:43.541 --> 48:44.958
I said stop.

48:45.041 --> 48:46.833
-Hey.
-I beg you, don't do anything to him.

48:46.916 --> 48:47.958
Will you stop or not?

48:48.666 --> 48:51.041
You'll be dead soon too.

48:52.416 --> 48:53.750
Shut up!

48:57.541 --> 48:59.166
The one person who deserves to die

48:59.750 --> 49:01.583
is you, you piece of shit.

49:07.708 --> 49:08.833
Thida.

49:08.916 --> 49:09.791
Thida.

49:10.416 --> 49:11.250
Thida.

49:11.833 --> 49:13.125
I took good care of you

49:14.250 --> 49:15.666
and your family.

49:16.750 --> 49:18.833
I'm a real piece of shit, aren't I?

49:18.916 --> 49:20.458
You're a piece of shit!

49:22.500 --> 49:23.500
You know what?

49:24.500 --> 49:26.625
People only listen to you

49:27.166 --> 49:28.833
because of your money.

49:29.791 --> 49:33.458
No one else believes
you're as smart as you think you are.

49:33.541 --> 49:34.375
You fucking idiot.

49:37.500 --> 49:39.208
If you don't believe me,

49:40.041 --> 49:41.916
ask your men.

49:42.916 --> 49:44.125
Ask them!

49:58.375 --> 49:59.416
Shoot me.

49:59.500 --> 50:00.750
Just shoot me already.

50:00.833 --> 50:02.708
Shoot me.

50:03.541 --> 50:06.291
I've been dying
to get the fuck away from you.

50:13.208 --> 50:14.291
You know what?

50:16.666 --> 50:19.500
I only put up with it this long…

50:22.041 --> 50:23.708
because of Jo.

50:24.541 --> 50:25.625
Jo?

50:26.333 --> 50:27.166
Yes.

50:28.833 --> 50:31.125
Only Jo.

50:34.583 --> 50:37.041
Every time your sweaty, wrinkled hand

50:37.791 --> 50:39.125
touched me,

50:40.041 --> 50:40.875
you know what?

50:41.708 --> 50:44.291
I was so disgusted
that I wanted to throw up.

50:44.791 --> 50:46.291
-Know that--
-All right!

50:46.375 --> 50:48.666
-Stop it!
-Stay still, asshole.

51:05.041 --> 51:06.916
Why did I love someone like you?

51:28.166 --> 51:29.125
Take care of it for me.

51:34.458 --> 51:35.291
Thida.

51:44.375 --> 51:46.708
There, there. Come.

51:46.791 --> 51:48.875
He told me to take care of you.

51:50.500 --> 51:52.250
You won't be pretty.

52:05.625 --> 52:06.458
No!

54:07.000 --> 54:12.000
