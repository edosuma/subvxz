00:36.320 --> 00:38.471
Officer on deck.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.714
Today, you're going to locate
a medium-sized Bug colony...

00:44.880 --> 00:45.950
...and wipe it out.

00:47.240 --> 00:50.392
Intel estimates infestation is level two.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.075
Which means we're up against
1000 active defenders.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.436
We know what to do.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.432
Kill them all.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.240
Yeah, that's the idea.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.119
Run the plan, lieutenant.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.111
Yes, sir.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.790
Geo.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.798
First team secures the landing zone, sir.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.274
Camacho.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.512
We'll locate the target
colony's entrance, sir?

01:15.360 --> 01:16.555
One-Oh-One.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.116
We give them the gas.
Kills Bugs, but don't hurt us.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.639
Baba.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.959
Geez, that's me.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.271
Flip the nuke, flip the launcher on the nuke.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.473
Oh, but not yet.

01:30.960 --> 01:31.996
Dutch.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.116
Me and Bessie seal the deal,
right down their Bug hole.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.631
Eagle One <i>ready for takeoff.</i>

01:38.800 --> 01:42.555
Remember your training,
and stick to the plan. Do you get me?

01:43.040 --> 01:45.714
- We get you, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.070
Lock and load.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.989
Yeah.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.600
Let's do this.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.558
All right, baby.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.519
Eagle One, <i>clear.</i>

02:31.680 --> 02:33.114
Eagle Two, <i>clear.</i>

02:33.280 --> 02:35.590
Eagle Three, <i>clear.</i>

02:36.520 --> 02:38.432
Eagle One, <i>touchdown in 10...</i>

02:38.920 --> 02:40.991
<i>...nine, eight...</i>

02:41.160 --> 02:44.471
<i>...seven, six, five...</i>

02:44.680 --> 02:49.311
<i>...four, three, two, one.</i>

03:07.520 --> 03:09.796
Geo, no!

03:11.200 --> 03:12.714
No, no. God, no. No, no!

03:22.720 --> 03:23.949
Bug.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.635
Come on, you apes.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.474
Move out. Move it. Let's go!

03:43.760 --> 03:44.910
Goddamn.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.395
They don't quit.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.353
What's your malfunction, lieutenant?

03:49.880 --> 03:51.633
Come on.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.759
Go get them!

03:59.040 --> 04:00.474
Form a perimeter.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.233
Holy shit.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.675
Oh, man.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.999
No time for praying, son. I got your back.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.155
Fire in the hole.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.430
- Nice one.
- Camacho, 9 o'clock.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.200
- Help me, help me.
- Camacho.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.675
Colonel Rico!

04:41.160 --> 04:42.674
Pull back. Stay close.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.191
Oh, man. We're surrounded again.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.916
Here goes the gas.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.478
Oh, shit.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.032
Let the gas settle in.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.993
Step back.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.196
Colonel Rico?

05:12.160 --> 05:14.356
Rico, where are you?

05:15.240 --> 05:16.720
Who was that?

05:17.640 --> 05:18.790
I can't see anything.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.719
Lieutenant, use your infrared.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.593
And keep your head down.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.393
Oh, right.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.430
Okay, my infrared.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.791
Infrared, infrared...

05:30.960 --> 05:32.110
Oh, there you are.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.150
That's not your infrared, lieutenant.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.312
Then what is it?

05:51.720 --> 05:55.270
Well, that was just outstanding.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.840
Well, sir...

05:57.600 --> 06:00.479
...how come I always get ripped in half?

06:00.640 --> 06:03.030
Bugs got your number, big man.

06:03.440 --> 06:07.116
Colonel, no one told us it was a trap.
That's not fair, sir.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.316
Here's a little combat secret for you,
lieutenant:

06:10.480 --> 06:13.120
War isn't fair. It's always a trap.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.399
Cancel your plans, troopers.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.954
We go again tomorrow.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.196
Sorry, sir, but don't you remember?

06:20.400 --> 06:21.675
Tomorrow's Air Day.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.072
Celebrating 25 years of filtered Martian air.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.600
Air Day?

06:26.760 --> 06:27.830
Yes, sir.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.435
We take our terraforming very seriously.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.071
No one appreciates a nice gulp
of fresh air like a Martian, sir.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.318
There are no Martians
in my Mobile Infantry, lieutenant.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.712
Only troopers who follow orders.
Do you get me?

06:42.160 --> 06:44.277
We get you, sir.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.830
Same time tomorrow, troopers.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.150
Dismissed.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.394
- Way to go, Baba.
- What the hell was that about?

07:06.200 --> 07:10.353
So how about those new Martian recruits?

07:10.520 --> 07:13.877
- If you've been watching, you know.
- Is there anyone who isn't watching?

07:14.320 --> 07:17.597
It's the wackiest shit
we've ever seen on FedNet.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.159
I call them my Lost Patrol.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.437
I might feed them to the Bugs and start over.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.832
What do you expect from
a bunch of Martian farm kids?

07:26.720 --> 07:29.519
How is it that I got posted
to the most uneventful colony...

07:29.680 --> 07:31.956
...in the entire Federation?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.150
Wait.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.800
Don't answer that.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.390
They could've made my life
a whole lot worse...

07:45.560 --> 07:47.438
...considering I'm the only
commanding officer...

07:47.600 --> 07:50.911
...ever to let an Arachnid Queen
through our Terran defenses.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.037
Don't be so hard on yourself, colonel.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.160
If you'd pulled that trigger,
we'd all be dead.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.272
Thanks, Ratzass.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.239
I need to stop reliving that moment.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.357
Shoot some caffeine?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.591
Check this out.

08:12.560 --> 08:16.156
Colonial duty isn't for everybody,
but Mars is a sweet place...

08:16.320 --> 08:18.789
...to kick back and get some R&R.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.872
Do I look like someone who needs R&R?

08:21.040 --> 08:24.556
I'd rather be stuck on a Bug planet.
At least I'd have something to shoot.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.439
The Martians prefer the slow life.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.876
You know if they break away
from the Federation...

08:29.040 --> 08:31.191
...they'll stop contributing
to the war on Bugs.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.471
Makes no sense.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.076
- Nice.
- Guys, here it goes:

08:40.240 --> 08:43.789
"There are no Martians in my Mobile Infantry.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.231
Only troopers who follow orders."

08:46.400 --> 08:48.869
"And the orders are: stay in your quarters...

08:49.040 --> 08:50.679
...and don't have any fun."

08:52.240 --> 08:54.755
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.957
"Real troopers don't celebrate Air Day.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.557
- Real troopers don't need air."
- "Real troopers don't need air."

09:03.000 --> 09:04.878
You know, maybe it's true what they say.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.077
Maybe Martians just aren't that smart.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.836
That's what people used to say
about me back in high school.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.196
You idiot.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.874
- You idiot.
- He totally heard you.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.878
You're all idiots.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.311
I rest my case.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.597
Martians and their goddamned air.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.673
That shit is starting to give me headaches.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.552
Hey, look!

09:44.400 --> 09:45.914
I wonder where they're going.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.632
The Fleet's making
a massive strike on the AQZ.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.280
Yeah!

09:57.320 --> 09:58.436
Yeah.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.990
- Come on. Let's take a picture.
- What's the matter?

10:01.200 --> 10:03.431
Can't stand sitting one out?

10:04.480 --> 10:06.437
I'm Infantry.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.077
We like to fight.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.198
<i>There's a distinctly different air
to Air Day this year.</i>

10:23.600 --> 10:25.956
<i>In addition to the usual all-night parties...</i>

10:26.160 --> 10:27.913
<i>...Martian separatists
are using the holiday...</i>

10:28.080 --> 10:30.720
<i>...to promote Martian independence.</i>

10:30.880 --> 10:34.191
<i>Recent opinion polls show that
one in three Martians are tired...</i>

10:34.400 --> 10:36.710
<i>...of fighting a war
that doesn't affect them.</i>

10:36.880 --> 10:41.796
<i>And a startling 73 percent said
they'd much rather drink beer.</i>

10:42.800 --> 10:48.990
<i>Well, it looks like fun to be a Martian,
but fun is for kids.</i>

10:49.880 --> 10:54.033
<i>At 26, Snapp isn't just the
Federation's youngest sky marshal.</i>

10:54.200 --> 10:57.193
<i>Federal Scientists now say
she's probably the smartest woman...</i>

10:57.360 --> 10:58.999
<i>...who's ever lived.</i>

10:59.760 --> 11:04.471
<i>In war, you're either part of the fight
or you're part of the problem.</i>

11:04.680 --> 11:06.797
<i>So do you think independence
could catch on...</i>

11:06.960 --> 11:09.156
<i>...in other emerging Federal colonies?</i>

11:09.320 --> 11:14.031
<i>No. Mars is a special case
where ego politics and isolationism...</i>

11:14.200 --> 11:17.876
<i>...have conspired against
moral responsibility.</i>

11:18.080 --> 11:20.800
<i>One last question
for our younger viewers, sky marshal:</i>

11:20.960 --> 11:24.795
<i>Have you ever been wrong about anything?</i>

11:27.080 --> 11:28.878
<i>It's my curse.</i>

11:29.080 --> 11:31.037
<i>Would you like to know more?</i>

11:31.680 --> 11:35.151
<i>In a bold move on the AQZ,
Sky Marshal Snapp deployed...</i>

11:35.320 --> 11:38.279
<i>...the entire Fleet for a surprise attack
on the Bugs.</i>

11:38.440 --> 11:41.478
<i>This marks the 20th anniversary
of the Klendathu invasion.</i>

11:41.640 --> 11:45.111
<i>Maybe this time,
the operation will not be a total failure.</i>

11:45.280 --> 11:47.033
<i>Would you like to know more?</i>

11:53.200 --> 11:56.989
<i>Interstellar flight 103 to Geneva...</i>

11:57.160 --> 12:00.756
<i>...now boarding at gate D-51.</i>

12:06.840 --> 12:08.797
Carmen.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.949
Carmen.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.594
Status report, code red.
Plus one and counting.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.114
It's getting thick out there.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.557
<i>Carmen.</i>

12:21.040 --> 12:22.554
Carmen.

12:24.440 --> 12:27.274
<i>Carmen, it's Carl.</i>

12:27.440 --> 12:28.760
Carl?

12:29.160 --> 12:30.799
You okay, ma'am?

12:30.960 --> 12:33.156
Keep your eye on the drop.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.279
Everything I'm about to say to you
is classified...

12:37.680 --> 12:39.478
<i>...so don't talk.</i>

12:39.640 --> 12:41.120
If you can read my thoughts...

12:41.600 --> 12:43.910
...then you know
I'm a little busy right now, Carl.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.072
...and prepare to evade fire.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.117
You're the only one
who can help right now, Carmen.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.714
<i>What is it this time?</i>

12:54.880 --> 12:57.270
I need you to get a message to Johnny.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.714
Johnny's on Mars, right?

12:59.920 --> 13:01.593
You're a lot closer than me.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.915
I can't get through to him
like I can with you.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.879
<i>You know Johnny. He's got a thick head.</i>

13:08.040 --> 13:10.157
Shit. Hold on.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.720
Carl?

13:11.880 --> 13:14.236
Plasma. Incoming.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.391
Maintain altitude.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.513
<i>Okay, I'm back.</i>

13:20.680 --> 13:22.672
So you want me to abandon my command...

13:22.840 --> 13:26.595
...in the AQZ and go to Mars now?

13:26.760 --> 13:29.753
<i>Flight 103 to Geneva boarding now.</i>

13:29.920 --> 13:32.037
Now would be good.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.917
Are you going to bother telling me why?

13:35.120 --> 13:38.557
<i>No. I think you're better off not knowing.</i>

13:39.600 --> 13:41.831
Direct hit on the <i>Ishizuka.</i>

13:42.000 --> 13:43.320
Heavy damage.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.229
Of course not,
because that's the way you like it.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.160
You haven't changed a bit, have you, Carl?

13:50.320 --> 13:53.279
<i>No, and I'm not planning to.</i>

13:53.440 --> 13:54.954
I need you to find Johnny.

13:55.120 --> 13:59.637
Amy Snapp is very upset with Mars,
and you know how she can be.

13:59.800 --> 14:03.999
Mobile Infantry, commence drop.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.713
Enjoy the flight, sir.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.951
Thank you.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.916
You're not being very concrete, Carl.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.075
Yes, I know.

14:14.240 --> 14:18.439
If the truth about Mars ever comes out,
it will destroy the Federation.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.513
Is the truth really that bad?

14:20.680 --> 14:22.911
Six units standing by for delivery.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.311
I'm afraid it is.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.156
Freeze.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.152
Well, anyway, good luck.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.310
That's it?

14:35.520 --> 14:36.510
"Good luck"?

14:36.680 --> 14:37.716
Yes.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.075
We're going to need it.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.550
Both hands in the air.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.672
He's in my head.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.873
So you're in, right?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.838
Where will I find him?

15:10.120 --> 15:14.956
In the Martian Outback.
Somewhere along the Valles Marineris.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.512
PSI, asshole.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.360
Carl?

15:31.840 --> 15:33.194
You're under arrest.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.314
Carl?

15:35.480 --> 15:37.073
Carl.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.155
- Carl Jenkins in custody.
- We got Jenkins.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.396
Put him under.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.553
Damn you, Amy.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.559
Simulation, my ass.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.640
You know,
even Bugs learn from their mistakes.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.320
Maybe we need an easier sim, sir.

16:11.600 --> 16:15.480
Hot LZ 1 is kind of where it all starts,
lieutenant. Unless you wanna run...

16:15.640 --> 16:17.711
...baby-Bug petting zoo.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.239
Well, I think we could all use a win.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.678
What's that?

16:29.880 --> 16:31.439
Bug plasma.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.398
What the hell?

16:35.960 --> 16:39.749
Bugs on Mars?
Is this the next training sim, sir?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.231
Negative. This is real world, trooper.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.113
Get everyone into battle armor.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.433
Yes, sir.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.634
How bad is it?

17:04.800 --> 17:07.031
There's a major Bug outbreak on the surface.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.873
- Including Plasma Bugs.
- Yeah.

17:09.359 --> 17:10.680
I kind of figured that.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.759
It's been classified as
a level-four infestation.

17:13.920 --> 17:17.834
The 2nd Mars Mobile Infantry
is deployed and engaged on the ground.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.957
Level four?

17:20.160 --> 17:21.640
Do you know what that means?

17:21.800 --> 17:23.280
We're getting visuals now.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.556
We just lost our connection
to the Federation, sir.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.554
We're sitting ducks up here.
Initiate evacuation protocols.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.870
Yes, sir.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.193
Direct plasma hit to flight bay.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.272
I'm taking Lost Patrol down to the planet.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.000
You're going in with those Martian kids?
Are you crazy?

17:47.160 --> 17:49.277
Someone's gotta knock out
those Bug batteries.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.830
We've trained for it, so today's the day.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.037
You're a brass-balled trooper
through and through, Rico.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.998
And goddamn it, I'm going with you.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.031
Hey, Ratzass, come on.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.236
Let's move.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.153
<i>Emergency systems activated.</i>

18:12.600 --> 18:13.795
What's your status, lieutenant?

18:14.960 --> 18:16.599
Power suits on, sir.

18:17.240 --> 18:20.153
Get everyone on the boat now.
This station is gonna blow.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.950
What? I'm sorry, sir, could you repeat that?

18:24.160 --> 18:27.278
<i>Code red. Evacuation protocol initiated.</i>

18:27.440 --> 18:29.193
Get everyone on the boat now.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.433
We got Bugs to kill.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.120
Oh, my God. We're all gonna die.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.912
You do not have permission to die.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.917
<i>Someone wanted me here.</i>

18:51.080 --> 18:55.438
<i>And whoever it was already knew
there were Bugs on Mars.</i>

19:02.280 --> 19:03.555
Colonel Rico.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.035
Lost Patrol.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.237
Today's the day to prove yourselves.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.717
We descend to the Mars surface immediately.

19:12.560 --> 19:16.793
Mars is your home, troopers,
and today, she needs your help.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.590
Wipe out every Bug that you see,
and take back your planet.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.314
Yes, sir.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.110
Training's over, troopers.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.193
Sergeant Major Ratzass
is coming along for the ride.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.711
- We're dropping with a legend.
- Yeah. Let's swing.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.349
Come on, you apes. You wanna live forever?

19:44.360 --> 19:45.714
To the dropship, now.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.553
On the bounce, troopers.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.077
Set your suits to zero pressure, troopers.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.712
Radio test. Do you all read me?

19:54.920 --> 19:56.832
- Baba, okay.
- One-Oh-One, okay.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.356
- Camacho, okay.
- Dutch, okay.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.591
Geo, okay.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.838
Colonel Rico, this looks bad.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.356
Move it, move it. Let's go.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.117
Move it or lose it.

20:18.880 --> 20:19.870
Let's get out of here.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.679
Yes, sir.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.519
The hangar door won't open, colonel.
We're a no-go.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.911
We're a no-go only if I say so.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.236
Everyone onboard?

20:29.960 --> 20:31.235
Yes, sir.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.034
Colonel, no good.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.236
We're stuck.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.756
Maybe this isn't gonna work, colonel.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.230
Bullshit.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.631
Link my suit to your weapons system.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.314
Roger that.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.119
Ready...

20:52.560 --> 20:54.074
...fire.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.511
Here we go.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.914
Oh, my God.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.911
Remember your training, troopers,
and you will not die.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.959
We're going down brown, sir.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.713
Are your people ready to jump?

21:40.880 --> 21:43.076
We're gonna jump?

21:43.600 --> 21:45.034
This is it, troopers.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.630
We're going HALO out the rear hatch.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.200
The choice is yours.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.919
Sit here and die...

21:51.120 --> 21:53.919
...or make the jump and die.

22:06.440 --> 22:07.430
Relax.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.035
It's a good day to die.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.110
<i>Good news is we are all-systems-go.</i>

22:39.280 --> 22:42.352
<i>Everything is working
the way it's supposed to.</i>

22:45.480 --> 22:48.917
The bad news is M.I.'s got
a 12-percent casualty drop rate...

22:49.080 --> 22:50.958
...that's pretty hard to crack.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.033
Five hundred meters to surface.

22:57.200 --> 23:01.638
Retros in three, two, one.

23:04.680 --> 23:05.830
Bounce back, baby.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.640
Oh, man, you do that once,
and you wanna do it again.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.359
Just like sex.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.989
- Even better.
- Oh, yeah.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.475
Not better than sex, though.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.280
Welcome to the Mobile Infantry.

23:17.440 --> 23:21.320
Now, cut the chatter and get ready
to shit yourselves all over again.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.119
<i>What are you talking about, sir?</i>

23:23.280 --> 23:25.078
<i>Look down, lieutenant.</i>

23:26.360 --> 23:28.079
<i>The surface is crawling with Bugs.</i>

23:28.560 --> 23:30.472
What do we do, sir?

23:31.880 --> 23:33.075
<i>Fire at will.</i>

23:34.840 --> 23:36.593
Kill them all, apes.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.080
Clear a spot to land.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.229
Form up. Hold what you got.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.596
Lieutenant, get over here.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.995
I can't, sir. Too many of them.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.356
Fine. Just hold your position.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.631
Lieutenant Baba, do not use the nuke.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.036
<i>Where are you, colonel?
I can't see your beacon.</i>

24:11.200 --> 24:13.112
Four o'clock. Eight hundred meters.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.275
Oh, shit.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.633
- Reload.
- Me too.

24:21.800 --> 24:22.790
No, me first.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.354
Are you all right?

24:33.520 --> 24:34.715
Yeah.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.194
I think so, sir.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.350
Ratzass.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.398
Ratzass, what's your 20?

24:41.280 --> 24:43.556
Lieutenant, go check on the sergeant major.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.313
Yes, sir.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.073
Colonel, over here.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.960
What's wrong with him?

24:49.120 --> 24:50.679
About to find out.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.792
Sergeant major?

24:56.920 --> 24:59.116
- Oh, God.
- Damn it.

25:02.880 --> 25:06.430
Looks like Ratzass popped a seal
and froze to death.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.669
Present arms.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.437
Lost Patrol, we've got work to do.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.995
More Bugs.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.872
On the bounce.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.232
Again.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.471
Hold your positions.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.598
Follow me.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.714
Plasma Bugs.

26:08.920 --> 26:12.800
If we don't kill them all tonight,
they'll take Mars by morning.

26:12.960 --> 26:16.749
You can get a speeding ticket from
a satellite, but the Federation misses this?

26:16.920 --> 26:20.357
Yeah, someone with experience
screwed this pooch.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.079
Ready nukes.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.800
Lieutenant,
you receiving my fire coordinates?

26:24.960 --> 26:26.076
Yes, sir.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.993
Camacho, come on.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.394
Prepare to fire.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.789
Sound-off ready.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.314
Eyes on target.

26:36.480 --> 26:37.880
<i>- I'm hot.</i>
<i>- Me too.</i>

26:38.040 --> 26:40.919
<i>In three, two, one.</i>

26:41.360 --> 26:42.555
This one's for Ratzass.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.918
Fire. Teach them not to mess with Mars.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.951
Fall back, troopers.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.076
On the bounce.

27:01.160 --> 27:03.675
Watch your rocket fuel.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.476
You stuck that landing.

27:23.360 --> 27:26.353
Stop dragging ass, lieutenant.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.994
Brace for impact!

27:47.360 --> 27:49.511
Well, I guess we showed them, huh?

27:49.880 --> 27:53.112
Yeah. And now all their friends
are gonna come looking for us.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.636
When's the rescue boat coming, sir?

27:55.800 --> 27:58.110
Sometime between now and never.

27:58.320 --> 27:59.356
Let's move.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.754
I mean, the Fleet, sir.

28:02.920 --> 28:06.118
They gotta be sending the Fleet, right?

28:06.960 --> 28:09.031
Let's keep moving.

28:22.720 --> 28:25.315
Alpha Squad 50-percent casualty rate.

28:25.480 --> 28:26.994
Delta Squad in full retreat.

28:27.160 --> 28:30.039
This operation's like slow-motion suicide.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.193
Captain, FedNet has reported
an infestation on Mars.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.398
- They've taken the whole planet.
- What?

28:37.680 --> 28:39.672
<i>Captain, we have two Federation starships...</i>

28:39.840 --> 28:41.160
<i>...on tactical approach.</i>

28:41.560 --> 28:45.315
- Report.
- Unable to confirm ID.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.911
John A. Warden, <i>this is the Special Branch.</i>

28:50.160 --> 28:51.640
The Special Branch?

28:51.800 --> 28:53.200
What are they doing here?

28:53.680 --> 28:57.310
<i>Captain Carmen Ibanez,
you are hereby relieved of duty...</i>

28:57.480 --> 28:59.039
<i>...for this operation.</i>

28:59.200 --> 29:01.669
<i>Relinquish command and surrender your vessel.</i>

29:07.160 --> 29:08.276
What's this about?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.318
Under whose orders?

29:10.560 --> 29:12.677
<i>We don't answer questions at Special Branch.</i>

29:12.840 --> 29:16.277
<i>Failure to comply
is treason against the Federation.</i>

29:16.480 --> 29:18.870
<i>Stand down, or we will destroy you.</i>

29:19.040 --> 29:20.633
Our vessels are the same, ma'am.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.280
Then we're in luck.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.359
<i>Stay right where you are.</i>

29:29.520 --> 29:33.992
Carl, I don't know why, but I believe you.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.356
John A. Warden <i>is breaking away, sir.</i>

29:41.040 --> 29:42.360
<i>She's out of her mind.</i>

29:42.640 --> 29:43.869
<i>Fire at will.</i>

29:53.600 --> 29:54.670
- Captain.
- Don't worry.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.354
That beam will never hit us.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.271
We're in their blind spot. Crap design.

30:04.440 --> 30:06.750
Captain, I'm afraid
we're losing speed and falling.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.673
Yes, I know.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.594
Prepare to fire
the main thrusters on my signal.

30:11.760 --> 30:15.834
We're going to swing by
and slingshot straight to Mars.

30:18.400 --> 30:22.155
<i>Flashes of light from Mars
tell the tale of a heroic last stand...</i>

30:22.320 --> 30:25.392
<i>...between a light platoon
of Mobile Infantry and a Bug army...</i>

30:25.560 --> 30:28.473
<i>...of 100,000 Arachnid warriors, and then...</i>

30:28.680 --> 30:30.911
<i>...Mars goes dark.</i>

30:31.280 --> 30:34.318
<i>Federal scientists now believe
an undetected Bug meteor...</i>

30:34.520 --> 30:38.833
<i>...may have impacted the
Martian Outback three years ago.</i>

30:39.000 --> 30:42.198
<i>Officials refuse to speculate
about how many, if any...</i>

30:42.400 --> 30:44.710
<i>...of Mars' human inhabitants
may have survived...</i>

30:44.880 --> 30:46.872
<i>...the Arachnid sneak attack.</i>

30:47.480 --> 30:50.393
<i>But who should we blame for this tragedy?</i>

30:50.720 --> 30:54.760
<i>Federal psychologists say
it's most likely Martians.</i>

30:54.920 --> 30:57.879
<i>They also warn us
that those oh-so-Martian yearnings...</i>

30:58.080 --> 31:01.232
<i>...for personal rights and freedom are,
in reality, primitive...</i>

31:01.400 --> 31:04.120
<i>...childlike behaviors
that destabilize society...</i>

31:04.280 --> 31:06.840
<i>...and weaken the human will to survive.</i>

31:07.000 --> 31:08.957
<i>Would you like to know more?</i>

31:19.520 --> 31:21.989
<i>It's not just about our safety.</i>

31:22.160 --> 31:23.719
<i>It's about duty.</i>

31:24.000 --> 31:25.957
<i>It's about the future.</i>

31:26.200 --> 31:29.955
<i>You're right.
Because the future is everyone's duty.</i>

31:31.480 --> 31:32.834
That is sharp.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.598
Very sharp.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.317
- Daniel?
<i>- Yes, Amy?</i>

31:39.600 --> 31:41.592
Do we have today's numbers?

31:41.760 --> 31:46.277
<i>Your approval rating is at 82.5 percent.</i>

31:46.520 --> 31:49.240
I almost don't believe it.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.710
- Almost.
<i>- It is historic.</i>

31:52.280 --> 31:55.318
<i>No other sky marshal
has ever been more popular.</i>

31:55.480 --> 31:59.952
Still, there's always room for improvement.

32:00.120 --> 32:04.592
<i>The more people hate Martians,
the more they like you.</i>

32:04.760 --> 32:07.719
<i>Speaking of which,
are we moving forward with the plan?</i>

32:08.280 --> 32:09.475
You tell me.

32:09.640 --> 32:11.233
Is the Q-bomb ready?

32:11.400 --> 32:14.359
<i>Yes, but I'm not sure if the public is ready.</i>

32:14.520 --> 32:17.672
Oh, they're ready.
They just don't know it yet.

32:18.360 --> 32:20.317
<i>Shall I prepare a statement?</i>

32:20.480 --> 32:21.675
Please.

32:21.840 --> 32:25.629
Something inspirational this time.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.640
Maybe hit some family notes.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.076
<i>You're right.</i>

32:32.240 --> 32:35.836
<i>Because the future is everyone's duty.</i>

32:36.400 --> 32:38.835
The only thing missing...

32:39.880 --> 32:41.997
...is a villain.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.672
The traitor of Mars is still sleeping it off.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.752
He's dreaming about high school.

33:02.360 --> 33:03.635
High school?

33:03.800 --> 33:05.120
Really?

33:05.400 --> 33:10.111
Can you imagine what Carl Jenkins
was like in high school?

33:10.920 --> 33:12.115
Wake him up.

33:22.120 --> 33:25.557
What is this thing you have for Bugs, Carl?

33:26.200 --> 33:31.195
Well, to beat your enemy,
you have to know your enemy.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.790
And I learn something new every day.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.557
And what did you learn today?

33:36.720 --> 33:39.713
Someone wanted Mars to get infested.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.396
And that someone's not you?

33:42.760 --> 33:46.151
You were in the perfect position
to mastermind it.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.275
Amy, please.

33:49.440 --> 33:51.830
What are you going to do to Mars?

33:52.360 --> 33:55.751
I'm going to save them from themselves.

33:56.240 --> 33:57.390
A Q-bomb?

33:57.560 --> 33:58.630
Really?

33:58.800 --> 34:01.190
Is that your solution?

34:01.360 --> 34:02.714
Come on, Amy.

34:02.880 --> 34:06.760
Is this about the Federation
or your approval ratings?

34:06.920 --> 34:08.956
I've heard enough.

34:16.560 --> 34:19.199
Sweet dreams, Carl.

34:21.159 --> 34:25.040
You don't need to worry
about my ratings, Carl.

34:25.199 --> 34:30.275
All it takes is a little fireworks,
and my ratings will soar.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.996
Sit back and enjoy the show, general.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.550
Think those Bugs are here
for us too, colonel?

34:48.719 --> 34:50.712
Yeah. They're watching us.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.078
They're afraid we'll nuke them
if they get too close.

34:54.480 --> 34:57.279
Just don't tell them we're out of nukes.

34:57.800 --> 35:00.235
Stupid Bugs ain't gonna
forget about us anytime soon.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.677
Bet they're just tired of us
nuking them right up their Bug hole.

35:06.080 --> 35:09.232
Forty-five degree... Okay.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.120
Come back. Come back.

35:13.960 --> 35:16.919
Can anyone tell me what the fuck
Lieutenant Baba's doing?

35:17.080 --> 35:21.233
He's working up some kind of
old-time radio rig, send out an SOS.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.674
He better not SOS
the whole damn hive, get us all killed.

35:26.240 --> 35:29.153
<i>This is Martian National Guard.
Please identify</i>

35:29.320 --> 35:31.357
Well, I'll be a Martian's uncle.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.553
<i>This is Martian National Guard.
Please identify.</i>

35:34.720 --> 35:35.915
George?

35:36.080 --> 35:38.356
<i>I repeat, this is Martian National Guard.</i>

35:38.520 --> 35:41.274
<i>- Please identify.</i>
- I may have got us a ride, sir.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.433
I may have underestimated you,
Lieutenant Baba.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.154
Is that you, coz?

35:47.320 --> 35:50.438
Well, hallelujah.

35:50.600 --> 35:54.560
What the heck you doing
out here in the middle of nowhere?

35:54.720 --> 35:57.280
We've been nuking Bugs, George. You?

35:58.040 --> 36:00.157
<i>I was out here rescuing our men.</i>

36:00.320 --> 36:02.789
<i>But it appears
there ain't no one left to rescue.</i>

36:03.680 --> 36:05.399
You mean everyone's dead?

36:05.600 --> 36:07.717
Well, no one's picking up, you hear?

36:07.880 --> 36:10.395
Maybe some of them's down in the mines.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.512
We got damn overrun.

36:12.680 --> 36:15.115
<i>I never seen so many Bugs in my life.</i>

36:15.280 --> 36:19.194
Well, they're still afraid of us.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.036
Run.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.153
I can't land.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.192
Go. Run for the boat.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.477
Use your retros and jump onboard.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.076
Camacho, go.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.440
Come on.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.600
Rico!

37:36.760 --> 37:38.558
No!

37:50.440 --> 37:51.556
Damn it.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.553
Colonel.

38:02.120 --> 38:05.750
<i>Mars: To be, or not to be?</i>

38:05.920 --> 38:09.755
<i>That's the big question,
and everybody has an opinion.</i>

38:09.920 --> 38:12.389
<i>Mars is a Bug planet, no question.</i>

38:12.600 --> 38:15.479
<i>One Q-bomb will fix that. Problem solved.</i>

38:15.640 --> 38:19.998
<i>Low-gravity birth makes babies stupid,
but instead, we call them "Martians."</i>

38:20.160 --> 38:23.232
<i>That's a fascinating perspective. Thank you.</i>

38:23.520 --> 38:27.673
<i>Any planet that symbolizes anger,
war and rampant male sexuality...</i>

38:27.840 --> 38:29.911
<i>...deserves to be blown up.</i>

38:30.120 --> 38:32.874
<i>A lot of ideas in there.
You've really done your homework.</i>

38:33.240 --> 38:38.679
<i>Mars is a small, mediocre planet
that's only popular because it's red.</i>

38:38.840 --> 38:40.957
<i>That's certainly one way of looking at it.</i>

38:41.120 --> 38:43.794
<i>Let's find out what Federation's
smartest woman thinks...</i>

38:43.960 --> 38:46.953
<i>...as we take you live to Space Command.</i>

38:53.560 --> 38:56.553
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of the United Citizens Federation...</i>

38:56.720 --> 38:58.871
<i>...Sky Marshal Amy Snapp.</i>

39:05.600 --> 39:09.594
<i>Fellow citizens, we have ourselves a problem.</i>

39:09.760 --> 39:13.879
The Arachnid outbreak on Mars
is quickly spinning out of control.

39:14.080 --> 39:18.393
We've lost contact with her major cities,
and her defenses are down.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.156
<i>You may have heard
that the Federation Fleet...</i>

39:21.320 --> 39:23.232
<i>...cannot come to the rescue this time...</i>

39:23.400 --> 39:26.916
<i>...because they're busy pummeling
the Bugs in their own backyard.</i>

39:27.240 --> 39:32.554
<i>But rest assured, fellow citizens,
we have an ace in the hole.</i>

39:33.440 --> 39:36.035
Ladies and gentlemen...

39:36.360 --> 39:38.352
...the Q-bomb.

39:39.120 --> 39:43.478
<i>Planted on Mars for this very purpose.</i>

39:43.760 --> 39:47.276
<i>No, not everyone is going to like the idea...</i>

39:47.440 --> 39:49.955
<i>...of losing a colony
at the press of a button.</i>

39:50.120 --> 39:52.237
But if you've ever been to the front lines...

39:52.400 --> 39:55.313
...then you know that to win this war...

39:55.480 --> 39:58.632
...you need to play the long game.

39:58.880 --> 40:00.712
Take a look around.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.714
<i>At your friends, at your loved ones...</i>

40:03.920 --> 40:06.799
<i>...and ask yourself one question:</i>

40:06.960 --> 40:11.113
<i>If we give them Mars,
then what will they want next?</i>

40:17.720 --> 40:22.078
<i>I've assembled a task force
to determine what assets, if any...</i>

40:22.240 --> 40:24.391
<i>...can be recovered from Mars.</i>

40:24.560 --> 40:27.712
<i>But we must act quickly, before...</i>

40:29.640 --> 40:33.953
Before sensitive targets are compromised
by Arachnid incursion.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.919
We can't afford to wait, because...

40:45.720 --> 40:49.794
We're not about to let Bugs
pry into our little secrets.

40:57.960 --> 41:00.794
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.319
Johnny.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.279
Johnny.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.956
Johnny Rico.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.876
Wake up, Johnny.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.118
You can't sleep all day.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.875
Come on, Johnny.

41:31.960 --> 41:35.112
Okay, fine.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.277
Seriously?

41:48.040 --> 41:49.633
Oh, Johnny.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.633
Feeling better?

42:07.680 --> 42:09.160
Am I...

42:10.040 --> 42:11.633
...dead?

42:20.520 --> 42:22.398
What the...

42:24.440 --> 42:26.033
Are you...

42:26.760 --> 42:27.750
...Diz?

42:29.760 --> 42:31.672
I knew that would work.

42:33.240 --> 42:35.835
You died at Whiskey Outpost.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.152
Wait. Am I dead too?

42:39.320 --> 42:40.754
No, silly.

42:40.920 --> 42:44.072
But the way you sleep, you might as well be.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.752
Where am I?

42:57.080 --> 42:59.276
Oh, shit.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.993
Mars.

43:16.520 --> 43:18.000
I'm on Mars.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.435
Yup.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.319
Mars needs you.

43:21.480 --> 43:24.120
And I need you to get rolling.

43:33.200 --> 43:34.680
Right.

43:35.440 --> 43:36.874
The Bugs.

43:37.040 --> 43:38.554
Exactly.

43:38.760 --> 43:40.080
The Bugs.

43:40.240 --> 43:43.631
- You are such a little genius.
- What...

43:43.800 --> 43:47.237
What about my guys, The Lost Patrol?

43:51.120 --> 43:52.554
Water.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.472
I need water.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.912
Well, that shouldn't be too hard.

44:02.080 --> 44:03.912
I need water.

44:22.680 --> 44:25.479
I keep drinking, but I'm still thirsty.

44:25.680 --> 44:26.955
Drink some more.

44:37.320 --> 44:39.391
Are you a ghost?

44:39.640 --> 44:41.074
No.

44:43.400 --> 44:44.880
So I'm not dead.

44:46.120 --> 44:47.236
Can the dead walk?

44:48.760 --> 44:49.750
No.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.152
Then keep walking.

45:14.440 --> 45:16.272
Get up, Rico.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.800
I...

45:18.560 --> 45:19.994
What's your malfunction?

45:22.240 --> 45:23.799
Okay.

45:27.840 --> 45:30.799
- Are you dying on me?
- What?

45:30.960 --> 45:34.032
I said, are you dying on me, trooper?

45:34.680 --> 45:35.716
No.

45:35.920 --> 45:37.354
No, what?

45:37.520 --> 45:38.510
No, sir.

45:40.360 --> 45:43.080
Then move your candy ass.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.436
Yes, sir.

46:07.840 --> 46:08.956
I don't get it, sir.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.992
Where's the Fleet?

46:11.200 --> 46:14.591
Don't ask me. MarsNet's down.
Everything's down.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.998
Oh, dang it.

46:17.480 --> 46:19.995
What kind of pilot blasts off on empty?

46:20.160 --> 46:24.074
I wasn't thinking, coz. I was scared.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.272
What if the Fleet isn't coming, sir?

46:26.440 --> 46:29.035
Of course the Fleet's coming. They have to.

46:29.200 --> 46:31.954
What, they're gonna just ditch us?
And all of Mars too?

46:32.120 --> 46:33.998
We about to ditch Mars our damn selves.

46:34.160 --> 46:37.756
You think Terran citizens are gonna care
about a few stranded Martians?

46:38.200 --> 46:42.035
They'd better at least pretend to care.
We haven't left the Federation just yet.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.554
What are you doing, Baba?

46:43.720 --> 46:46.235
I'm trying to get
some of our ass-kicking fight up...

46:46.400 --> 46:48.631
...on FedBook, but I can't get connected.

46:48.800 --> 46:52.111
Bug plasma probably fried the com satellites.

46:57.560 --> 46:59.119
So are you sure I'm not dead?

46:59.520 --> 47:02.194
Will you stop asking me that already?

47:02.480 --> 47:04.437
Well, it just...

47:04.840 --> 47:07.719
...made sense that I might be dead.

47:08.280 --> 47:10.078
Made sense?

47:10.240 --> 47:13.358
Not everything makes sense, Johnny boy.

47:13.960 --> 47:15.440
You're alive and well.

47:15.640 --> 47:19.759
And the Federation's going to crack
their own colony with a Q-bomb.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.639
Q-bomb?

47:21.800 --> 47:23.678
You want me to take care of it?

47:23.840 --> 47:28.039
No. I need you to take care of it.

47:30.360 --> 47:32.955
Do it for me, Johnny.

47:34.080 --> 47:36.276
Please.

47:36.760 --> 47:38.399
Yeah.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.199
Yeah.

47:46.800 --> 47:48.393
Okay.

47:49.240 --> 47:50.674
For you.

47:50.840 --> 47:51.990
Good.

47:56.320 --> 47:59.836
- I just don't know where the hell it is.
- Oh, that's the easy part.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.912
It's under an old terraforming tower.

48:02.080 --> 48:04.515
We're already halfway there.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.991
Yes, sir.

48:13.880 --> 48:16.440
Do you remember high school?

48:16.600 --> 48:18.717
I remember football.

48:19.200 --> 48:20.873
And enlistment.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.673
That's about it.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.599
Oh, and that asshole, Zander.

48:24.760 --> 48:25.876
Zander.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.997
What a prick.

48:28.920 --> 48:31.151
What about your friends, Johnny?

48:31.320 --> 48:32.879
Friends?

48:33.040 --> 48:36.317
I don't know. I had a few.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.997
Not really sure where they all went.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.880
Well, what about Carl?

48:42.040 --> 48:44.600
Weren't you guys best friends or something?

48:44.760 --> 48:46.513
Yeah, I guess so.

48:46.680 --> 48:48.911
But that was a long time ago.

48:49.080 --> 48:50.309
Carl changed.

48:50.880 --> 48:53.520
He's a general now,
and it's almost like he's too big...

48:53.680 --> 48:55.751
...to be friends with.

48:57.920 --> 49:00.355
I mean, it's not his fault.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.432
He's busy saving the whole Federation.

49:02.600 --> 49:03.829
Yeah.

49:04.040 --> 49:06.475
But I guess he could try a little harder.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.995
Let's not get our hopes up.

49:13.960 --> 49:15.679
- Come on, Johnny.
<i>- Come on, Johnny.</i>

49:15.840 --> 49:18.912
- We are friends, aren't we?
<i>- We are friends, aren't we?</i>

49:21.680 --> 49:23.911
- Johnny.
- What?

50:08.880 --> 50:10.519
Come on.

51:13.480 --> 51:16.120
Try any stupid mind tricks,
and we will kill you.

51:16.280 --> 51:21.355
- Do you get me?
- Yes, I get you coming and going.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.675
What the hell was that, Carl?

51:31.840 --> 51:33.832
Classic speech, Amy.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.799
Really sorted things out for the masses.

51:36.960 --> 51:40.715
"If you love your family,
then you should let me blow up Mars..."

51:41.000 --> 51:42.639
Shut up.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.118
The people need an explanation, Carl.

51:48.280 --> 51:51.796
And they prefer one
that tastes good and goes down easy.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.119
This isn't a popularity contest.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.876
Leading the Federation
is about responsibility.

52:00.040 --> 52:04.000
No. It's all about ratings, Carl.

52:04.160 --> 52:06.629
And you screwed with mine.

52:06.800 --> 52:09.634
I guess I know my enemy.

52:09.800 --> 52:14.192
General Carl Jenkins,
you are hereby charged with sedition...

52:14.400 --> 52:17.791
...and conspiracy against
the United Citizen Federation.

52:17.960 --> 52:22.512
At 1600 hours, the Federal Council
will convene to hear your case...

52:22.680 --> 52:27.277
...and when you are found guilty,
witness your execution.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.510
Is there anything
you wish to say at this time?

52:36.440 --> 52:37.590
Yes.

52:37.800 --> 52:38.950
I beg you, Amy.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.870
Don't blow up Mars.

52:42.040 --> 52:45.477
Take it back from the Bugs
and return it to the Martian people.

52:45.680 --> 52:51.153
Show them, show everyone
just how big the Federation really is.

52:51.320 --> 52:52.470
Too late.

52:52.640 --> 52:54.950
Mars is fucked.

52:55.200 --> 52:57.920
In a few hours, you'll be dead, Carl.

52:58.080 --> 53:00.356
Then I can get back to work...

53:00.520 --> 53:03.831
...and blow up Mars as a warning
to any future colony...

53:04.000 --> 53:06.799
...that will not bend to the Federal will.

53:09.080 --> 53:11.800
It's an epic, elegant revenge.

53:12.400 --> 53:14.517
It's so you, Amy.

53:15.320 --> 53:18.996
Except you went and made me the fall guy.

53:23.920 --> 53:26.515
You broke my nose.

53:26.720 --> 53:28.712
You fuck.

53:30.200 --> 53:32.920
Now it's your turn, Johnny.

53:37.320 --> 53:38.754
Johnny.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.957
God, no.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.955
Diz, I kicked ass.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.632
Yeah, trooper.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.952
You kicked ass.

54:08.200 --> 54:09.793
Battery's dead.

54:09.960 --> 54:11.076
Can't move.

54:11.400 --> 54:13.278
Let's get you out of that.

54:14.240 --> 54:16.311
Good idea.

54:28.760 --> 54:31.195
It's good to see you again, Johnny.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.397
It's been too long, that's for sure.

54:35.480 --> 54:39.190
The last thing I remember
is that night in Tango Urilla.

54:39.720 --> 54:42.315
You were everything I ever wished for.

54:42.920 --> 54:45.196
You were everything and a bit more.

54:45.360 --> 54:48.876
- Where'd you learn to do that, anyway?
- Johnny.

54:51.280 --> 54:52.475
It's true.

54:52.680 --> 54:54.831
I wish it could've lasted a lifetime.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.798
Oh, Johnny.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.314
You're making me cry.

54:59.160 --> 55:01.391
You know I fucking hate this shit.

55:01.560 --> 55:04.394
You started it, Diz.
You got the whole ball rolling, really.

55:04.560 --> 55:06.358
I just never picked it up.

55:06.520 --> 55:07.715
Oh, stop it.

55:07.880 --> 55:10.190
You were just fine, Johnny.

55:10.360 --> 55:11.874
Really.

55:15.520 --> 55:16.795
There.

55:20.320 --> 55:22.357
That old terraforming tower?

55:22.520 --> 55:23.954
Yeah.

55:24.120 --> 55:25.600
It's there.

55:25.800 --> 55:27.792
Just raring to blow.

55:30.200 --> 55:33.352
Who wants to blow up Mars, Diz, and why?

55:33.520 --> 55:38.231
Unfortunately, that's a long, sad story.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.278
Which happens to be classified.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.392
Classified?

55:44.360 --> 55:45.840
Diz?

55:56.160 --> 55:58.629
<i>You'll find a way, Johnny.</i>

55:58.800 --> 56:00.792
<i>You always do.</i>

56:04.760 --> 56:06.638
Oh, my God.

56:06.840 --> 56:08.593
Oh, crap, what now?

56:08.800 --> 56:11.110
Colonel Rico's still alive.

56:11.280 --> 56:12.794
Well, how's that's bad?

56:12.960 --> 56:14.474
Well, it's not bad, it's good.

56:15.160 --> 56:17.197
But it means we left a man behind.

56:17.360 --> 56:19.352
Mobile Infantry doesn't leave people behind.

56:19.560 --> 56:23.395
That's right.
Now it's our turn to do some rescuing.

56:23.560 --> 56:24.994
You mean go back to Mars?

56:25.160 --> 56:27.800
- We gotta get Colonel Rico back.
- Fuck, yeah!

56:27.960 --> 56:30.031
Now, look here, amigos...

56:30.240 --> 56:35.110
...what you're talking about is
a one-way rocket right back to Bug city.

56:35.280 --> 56:36.475
We're the Mobile Infantry.

56:36.640 --> 56:37.869
It's time to get mobile.

56:38.080 --> 56:40.993
Yeah. Don't ask why. Ask why not.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.196
Well, okay.

56:42.360 --> 56:45.159
But how am I supposed to land without retros?

56:45.320 --> 56:47.710
You're the pilot. Look for someplace soft.

56:47.920 --> 56:50.799
Too bad your head's not bigger.

57:33.640 --> 57:34.676
<i>Damn Bugs.</i>

57:34.840 --> 57:37.230
<i>You kill one,
and there's 10 more to take its place.</i>

58:09.640 --> 58:10.960
Damn it.

58:37.040 --> 58:39.475
You picked a good day to die.

59:53.880 --> 59:56.315
It is a good day to die.

59:58.080 --> 59:59.594
Okay.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.673
<i>- Head down, colonel.</i>
- What?

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.354
<i>Incoming.</i>

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.639
<i>Colonel, are you okay?</i>

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.116
Lieutenant Baba?

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.320
Yes, sir, colonel.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.711
We knew you'd make it.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.832
This is not good.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.320
Oh, my God.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.834
No.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.516
Everybody, jump.
This landing ain't gonna be pretty.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.512
Hey, what about you?

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.673
I am a mighty Martian warrior...

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.197
...as good as y'all,
and probably a whole lot better.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.950
Kill them all!

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.592
See you, coz.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.640
I thought he was funny,
and at least he went out with a bang.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.039
Yeah.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.914
Colonel.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.191
All right.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.311
It's so great to see you, sir.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.314
Yeah. We're kind of running out of time.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.551
What's the situation, lieutenant?

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.631
Well, sir, we thought it was pretty bad.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.760
No sign of the Fleet,
and you left behind on Mars...

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.912
...and no connection to FedNet, even.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.436
The Federation's blown us off, sir.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.069
- Why are they doing this?
- They've left us behind, sir.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.436
Is it because we're Martians?

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:06.670
There are no Martians in my Mobile Infantry.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.355
Only troopers who follow orders.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.190
Awaiting your orders, sir.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.999
Good.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.035
Our next mission begins immediately.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.236
We need to get to
that old terraforming tower.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.078
<i>Fellow citizens...</i>

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.199
<i>...today is a sad day, indeed.</i>

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.710
Mars has gone silent...

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.634
...her surface overwhelmed by Arachnids...

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.590
...with no sign of survivors...

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.639
...military or civilian.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.238
<i>We now stand at a critical juncture.</i>

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.439
After weighing our options, I now believe...

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.071
...there is only one thing left to do.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.076
We must dare to destroy Mars.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.757
Our war against the Bugs
cannot be won by committee...

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.311
...or by debate, or by due process.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.437
It can only be won...

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.799
<i>...by citizens
who have the guts to do what's right.</i>

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:22.512
<i>To make the hard decisions
that will ensure our safety...</i>

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.832
...and indeed, the survival of our species.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.719
Oh, Mars.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.755
We forgive you for your fleeting
captivation with independence.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.155
<i>We will remember you
for your frontier spirit...</i>

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.789
<i>...and your sheer will to survive.</i>

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.354
And most of all, your refusal to
let Bugs set foot on your soil.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.680
<i>Long live Mars, the god of war.</i>

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.634
<i>You have earned my deepest respect.</i>

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.759
And by my authority as sky marshal...

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.879
...I hereby grant you eternal rest...

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.794
...along with all those Bugs.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:56.117
<i>Sorry to interrupt, sky marshal,
but someone has sabotaged MarsNet.</i>

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:00.110
The citizens need to know
that we're still in the fight for Mars.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.670
What? No.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.399
Captain.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.949
I'm connected live to Fort Kilo.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.518
<i>The Mobile Infantry is alive and well.</i>

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.313
But...

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.119
That's impossible.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.875
<i>See for yourself, sky marshal.</i>

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.114
<i>Are we live?</i>

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.272
<i>- We're on.</i>
<i>- Rico here.</i>

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.793
<i>While engaging the enemy,
we discovered a live Q-bomb.</i>

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:34.480
<i>The thing was set to blow by mistake,
so we shut the thing down pronto.</i>

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.359
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.320
<i>Just in time, too,
thanks to some Martian troopers.</i>

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:42.312
<i>Hope that wasn't a problem.</i>

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.156
<i>We're gonna keep fighting,
and we're gonna kill a lot of damn Bugs.</i>

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.118
<i>Lost Patrol.</i>

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.239
<i>We got this.</i>

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.153
<i>Mars ain't done for yet.</i>

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.755
<i>We're gonna cook up some real Bug-BQ.</i>

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.192
<i>With some sauce.</i>

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.833
No. No.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.119
<i>So don't you worry, sky marshal.</i>

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.835
<i>We're still here,
and we're gonna keep fighting.</i>

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.832
<i>And we're gonna win.</i>

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.673
Colonel, look at that.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.915
Well, here we go again.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:02.914
Shit.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.236
Fire!

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.270
It looks like all the Bugs
are coming to this picnic.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.875
If only there were a way
to crash their little party.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.634
Sir, the Bugs are gonna
tear this place apart.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.519
Geo.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.151
What happens if you turn that thing on?

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.152
You mean, like, make some weather?

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.273
I mean rip the sky apart. Can you do that?

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.672
The core's power's still live.
I think we can manage.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.559
Do it. I want full power.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.552
We're going for balls-out overload.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.710
Give me 10 minutes.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.032
- Hey, Camacho, you wanna help?
- You bet.

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.919
Lost Patrol, Geo needs 10 minutes.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.434
Make sure he gets it.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.958
What happens after 10 minutes?
They gonna make it rain?

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.713
Like Bugs give a shit about water.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.360
No, that ain't how it works.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.957
They're gonna overload the reactor
and blow up the atmosphere.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.952
Well, what about us?

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.632
Oh, shit.

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.913
- Flip everything to full power.
- You got it.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.794
Seems easy enough.

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:49.313
Geo's doing some good work.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.309
Yeah, if you like watching
the whole world come apart.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.591
You wanna live forever, lieutenant?

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.720
No, but a little longer would be okay.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.191
We're born and raised on Mars.

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:10.750
Never seen storms like this.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.398
Yeah!

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.993
Too bad the good citizens
of the Federation can't see this.

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.358
Yeah, they ought to know
that someone's still holding the line.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.229
The whole Federation's been
watching you guys, this whole time.

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:47.435
<i>Carmen.</i>

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.037
She's right. My camera's linked to FedNet.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.590
<i>She's right. My camera's linked to FedNet.</i>

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:59.673
<i>The Federation may have decided
that Mars is a lost cause...</i>

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:02.600
<i>...but not these troopers,
with their leader Johnny Rico.</i>

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.594
That's me!

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.029
That's me.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.270
What?

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.954
- You shitting me?
- Yeah, look.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.270
Eyes up.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.672
I can't hold them much longer, colonel.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.194
We gotta blow the bridge.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.551
Not yet, we don't. Geo makes the call.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.236
Excuse me while I rip the sky.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.080
That's the last one.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.398
We're in business.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:41.480
That does it. This tower
is now one big weather bomb.

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.790
Good work, troopers.

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.873
Everyone in the Lost Patrol is a hero today.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:49.636
I'm gonna savor this moment
the rest of my life.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.190
All five minutes of it.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.875
- One-Oh-One, kill the bridge.
- Roger.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.717
Lost Patrol, let the Bugs have this.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.998
Geo, we're coming up.
Then we're getting the hell out of here.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.634
Getting out?

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.280
Which way is out?

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.715
Follow me.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.270
Geo, how many minutes we got?

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.190
<i>Eight, maybe?</i>

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.550
"Maybe"?

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.360
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.759
Dutch!

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.438
Why do I always get ripped in half?

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.239
Dutch!

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.069
- Fuck.
- Oh, Dutch.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.880
The Bugs really did have his number.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.318
What the hell?

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.074
Don't look good, lieutenant.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:02.119
Yeah, colonel, we're so screwed.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.350
Fall back to the tower.

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.955
- And then what?
- Kill them all. What else?

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.589
That's right. We're Mobile Infantry.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.951
We don't give up.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.635
Fuck you!

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.838
Colonel, we got Bugs in the house.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.956
Bugs, man.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:33.717
No matter where you go,
there's always freaking Bugs, man.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.154
Reload.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.273
Look out.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.636
Come on.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.230
This way.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.551
This place is going to blow.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.194
Let's go, troopers.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.795
We're not dead yet.

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:04.752
Go, go, go.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.354
How high we gonna go?

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.034
Higher than the Bugs.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.271
Oh, man. They're everywhere, man.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.155
Oh, shit.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.471
Oh, my God. There's so many Bugs.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.393
Are we gonna make it out of here?

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.394
Who knows?
I'm not ready to give up yet. Are you?

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.029
- What are you, some kind of hero?
- Yeah.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.960
Because a hero always makes it back home.

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.276
I like that, lieutenant.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.274
If we live through this,
I might get it tattooed on my ass.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.717
Maybe I'll let you fight
in my Mobile Infantry after all.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.712
Awesome.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.030
<i>Sounds like you guys are
having some fun down there.</i>

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.078
- Is that you, Carmen?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.391
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm heading in now.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.394
But you're making things
difficult with this weather system.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.878
<i>No one can fly in this mess.</i>

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.360
<i>Except for you, Carmen.</i>

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.916
<i>You can fly through anything.</i>

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.839
They're gaining on us.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.832
Shake them off.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.399
Move out.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.757
Carmen, over here.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.510
<i>Yeah, only there is one thing.</i>

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.956
What? What's the problem?

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.872
Nowhere to touch down.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.950
<i>With these winds, I'm barely staying afloat.</i>

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.875
You all right?

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.839
<i>Barely.</i>

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.551
- Colonel?
- What?

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.111
I'm thinking we got two minutes.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.039
Maybe less.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.793
- Colonel.
- Now what?

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.759
Over there. On the other side of the tower.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.038
They're piling up the wall.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.560
Roger that, Camacho.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.480
You hear that, Carmen? No time.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.395
Open the hatch and hover.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.994
What's the plan?

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.480
Just open the hatch.

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.950
Just a simple question.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.152
Come on, you apes.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.312
Jump for it.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.076
I can't, sir.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.560
What do you mean, you can't?

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.313
You wanna die here?

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.160
- One, you go.
- Ladies first.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.431
Somebody jump.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.672
That idiot.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.480
Come on.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.120
Thanks.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.999
Here goes.

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.039
I got you.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:28.113
On the bounce, lieutenant.
Move it or lose it.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.680
I'm all out of jump juice, colonel.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.756
You go on without me.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.560
Not gonna happen, lieutenant.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.554
You're going home, and that's an order.

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.674
Bring her down.

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:03.990
You got it.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.470
Camacho.

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.438
- Good job, trooper.
- I got you.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.279
Let's get off this rock.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.080
Hold on tight, troopers.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.598
Any moment now.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.039
Oh, hey, guys.

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.840
Carl? What are you doing here?

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.992
It's great to see you too.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.675
Doesn't that chair belong to the sky marshal?

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.874
She's taking a couple of personal days.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.874
I'm just keeping things moving
until she gets back.

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.316
I'd never dream of being sky marshal.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.551
So Amy Snapp's just gonna get away with it?

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.951
That's politics, Johnny boy.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.959
Did you know there were
Bugs on Mars too, Carl?

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.471
And you just let it happen?

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.110
Carmen.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.476
How could you even think such a thing?

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.119
Very funny.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:10.432
But this is the war
we can never stop fighting.

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.994
The Bugs will never quit.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.436
And if we do, we're dead.

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:17.675
For a few thousand years...

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:21.959
...we humans enjoyed the relative peace
of fighting amongst ourselves.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.840
And then we reached for the stars.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.275
I mean...

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.636
...what did we think would happen?

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.871
Well, thinking's your job, Carl.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.633
I'm the guy who follows orders.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.470
I like that.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.759
Now, go take back Mars from the Bugs...

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.556
...will you, General Rico?

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.234
Yes, sir.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.480
What?

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:55.479
It's always good to see you, Carl.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.631
There was a massive fire around us.
It looked like it was gonna get bad.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:11.793
- Officer on deck.
- At ease.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.995
You troopers got something special.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.237
Something everyone wants.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.993
You lived to tell the tale.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.360
Congratulation, troopers.

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.000
You are born again hard...

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.880
...and I am proud to serve with you
in the Mobile Infantry.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.629
Yeah.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.029
All right.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.752
We're gonna go have a beer, sir.

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:39.355
Toast Mars, you know? Wanna come?

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:43.119
Thanks. I gotta hit the sack.

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.314
That's why they call him the "old man."

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:50.677
Lieutenant, can I have a word with you?

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.993
Yes, sir.

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:57.631
I wonder what you'd do if you
found out that Sky Marshal Snapp...

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:02.158
...let the Bugs start a colony on Mars
so she'd have an excuse to blow it up.

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.356
Is that what you're telling me, sir?

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:11.953
I'm saying everyone's got
a right to fight for what's theirs...

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.478
...maybe most especially Martians.

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:20.832
From one Martian to another,
good work, lieutenant.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.835
Tomorrow, we kill them all again.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.276
- See you on the bounce.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.800
Bounce good, sir.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.315
Roger that, lieutenant.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:03.237
What did Snapp know,
and when did she know it?

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.352
<i>Anti-Federal activist MarzCo...</i>

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.639
<i>...is asking a musical question
that's on everyone's lips.</i>

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.838
<i>Federal opinion polls show
Sky Marshal Snapp's approval ratings...</i>

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.235
<i>...are in question.</i>

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.552
<i>No one doubts her genius, but can she lead?</i>

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.120
<i>Would you like to...</i>

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.112
<i>We'll leave it to MarzCo.</i>

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:44.030
Officer on deck.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:52.071
Today, you're going to locate
a medium-sized Bug colony...

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.594
...and kill them all.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.796
Yeah!

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.191
Come on, you apes. You wanna live forever?
