WEBVTT

00:00.320 --> 00:03.590
Previously on "ugly betty"... excuse us.

00:03.750 --> 00:04.910
(Betty) mr. Meade? (Man) there's no pulse.

00:05.060 --> 00:07.400
Is this bradford meade's body?

00:07.570 --> 00:11.810
I have a proposition you might be interested in.

00:14.210 --> 00:16.520
Motion to terminate wilhelmina slater.

00:16.690 --> 00:18.590
All those in favor. (Daniel and alexis) aye.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.520
Did you come to clean out your office,wilhelmina?

00:20.690 --> 00:22.630
No,daniel. I came to clean out yours.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.340
"Slater." We're currently setting up our offices,

00:25.500 --> 00:27.320
And there are still positions available.

00:27.470 --> 00:31.920
All right. What is this guy's name? I don't know. Something lame,like gio.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.140
Tell me who you're dating. Henry from accounting. There.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.570
More. He got a girl pregnant.

00:35.740 --> 00:37.610
Wow. You are being stupid.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.100
I know you're leaving in five months,

00:39.270 --> 00:41.540
And i know that i'm gonna get my heart broken,

00:41.700 --> 00:43.450
But maybe it's worth it.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.430
So let me get this straight.

00:52.580 --> 00:54.310
Our father left a video for us.

00:54.470 --> 00:55.500
(Alexis) is this a new will?

00:55.680 --> 00:57.480
No,no. It's simply a personal message

00:57.640 --> 00:58.820
He recorded for the both of you

00:58.990 --> 01:01.430
A few weeks before he died.

01:02.060 --> 01:04.890
I'll wait outside. Thank you.

01:05.180 --> 01:06.870
He must've known he was sick.

01:07.050 --> 01:08.570
Well,we'll never know.

01:08.740 --> 01:11.280
Alexis,daniel,  i'm sick.

01:11.770 --> 01:13.750
Who knows how much time  i have left?

01:13.910 --> 01:15.690
Well,obviously,  if you're watching this,

01:15.860 --> 01:17.300
I didn't have a lot.

01:17.470 --> 01:19.190
Hopefully,you gave me  a proper send-Off.

01:19.350 --> 01:20.830
I thought it was nice. Shh.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I didn't reveal  who i wanted

01:22.160 --> 01:24.300
To run meade publications  in my will,

01:24.470 --> 01:27.840
Because i wanted to explain  my decision to you.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.290
Is this thing on?

01:31.460 --> 01:32.530
(Sighs) typical.

01:32.690 --> 01:33.860
Yeah. (Coughs)

01:34.800 --> 01:36.100
Running a company  like this

01:36.250 --> 01:38.970
Requires a specific type  of leadership.

01:39.130 --> 01:40.270
You have to have confidence,

01:40.430 --> 01:42.530
Be able to smell blood  in the water.

01:42.690 --> 01:46.020
You need to possess  a killer instinct.

01:47.050 --> 01:50.430
So after long consideration,  i choose--

01:50.600 --> 01:51.570
(Betty) mr. Meade--

01:51.730 --> 01:52.280
Oh,i'm sorry.

01:52.440 --> 01:53.230
I didn't realize  you were in the m--

01:53.400 --> 01:56.730
Oh! Ah,whoopsy-Daisy.  Sorry.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.360
Daniel sent me  to deliver this thing...  (coughing)

01:58.530 --> 02:00.500
And your assistant  wasn't there. I'm sorry. Come on,betty.

02:00.670 --> 02:05.740
It's fine. It's fine. Just  set the camera up and leave.  Okay. Yep,that's right.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.720
<Font color="#4096d1">±¾×öä»½ö¹©ñ§ï°½»á÷£¬ñï½ûóãóúéìòµóãí¾</font>

02:08.330 --> 02:09.590
Uh,can i get you  anything else?

02:09.759 --> 02:11.780
No.  Okay.

02:12.070 --> 02:13.070
(Coughs) come on.

02:13.250 --> 02:16.240
It is my desire that one  of you become the president

02:16.420 --> 02:19.970
And chief fiduciary officer  of meade publications.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.560
So i hope  you'll both understand

02:21.720 --> 02:23.310
When i tell you

02:23.480 --> 02:25.540
That i choose my d--

02:28.500 --> 02:29.420
Is this thing even on?

02:29.590 --> 02:31.580
Yes,it's on. It's on.

02:31.770 --> 02:32.780
There you go.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.110
Wait,what-- What happened?

02:35.290 --> 02:38.000
Dad. Oh,learn to work stuff.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.800
It's pretty clear he was going to say,"my daughter." No,it's not.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.260
He was gonna say, "i choose my daniel."

02:43.430 --> 02:46.150
"My daniel?" Who says that? He did all the time.

02:46.330 --> 02:48.130
"My daniel this... my daniel that..."

02:48.290 --> 02:50.400
Obviously we're not going to be settling this right now.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.550
Tomorrow morning we're gonna talk to mom about the trial,

02:52.710 --> 02:54.210
Maybe she'll have an opinion on this.

02:54.360 --> 02:58.170
Fine. Until then, no one sits behind his desk.

02:58.340 --> 02:59.920
Agreed.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.650
Tell me again why we're stealing your father's chair.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.360
We're not stealing it. We're guarding it.

03:05.530 --> 03:07.010
Until we figure out who runs meade,

03:07.170 --> 03:08.270
No one sits in it.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.320
But couldn't alexis just get another chair

03:10.490 --> 03:12.130
And put that behind the desk and sit in that?

03:12.300 --> 03:16.160
No--She--That's not... whose side on you on? Yours. I'll guard the chair.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.350
The chair is life. The chair is everything.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.770
Look,i can run meade just as well as alexis.

03:20.940 --> 03:23.470
I can smell blood in the water.

03:23.630 --> 03:26.670
You know, i'm a good leader. Of course you are,daniel.

03:26.830 --> 03:29.980
There it is! I knew you took it!

03:30.160 --> 03:31.690
Run,betty. Come on. Run. Hurry!

03:31.850 --> 03:33.590
I'm going. I'm going. Out of my way. Excuse me.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.270
Protect that chair! Keep it--

03:36.710 --> 03:37.410
Sorry.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.520
Would you grow up,daniel? Hey.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.320
Get out of there. That's notyours. You know it is. You get out of there.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.230
You get out. You get out.

03:45.390 --> 03:46.310
Why are you so strong?

03:46.490 --> 03:48.070
What,did they give you super strength

03:48.230 --> 03:50.220
When they installed your vagina?

03:50.400 --> 03:53.580
Guys,everyone is watching.

03:58.380 --> 04:00.310
Now i'm happy to guard the chair

04:00.460 --> 04:04.390
Until you talk to your mother and figure it out.

04:04.690 --> 04:05.720
Just so you know,

04:05.890 --> 04:08.470
They did give me super strength.

04:11.830 --> 04:15.060
Betty,you heard my dad call me "my daniel," right?

04:15.240 --> 04:16.519
Sure.

04:16.959 --> 04:19.390
Oh,the children are cranky today.

04:19.550 --> 04:20.459
Did you give them both a time-Out?

04:20.630 --> 04:21.360
Exhausting.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.770
Milady. Thank you.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.540
And mi-Other-Lady. Oh,thank you. Hmm.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.730
I have a big surprise for our date tomorrow night.

04:27.900 --> 04:28.740
Wear socks...

04:28.910 --> 04:31.410
'Cause they're gonna get knocked off.

04:31.570 --> 04:34.440
Oh,a surprise!

04:35.100 --> 04:37.180
Oh,the last surprise i got on a date

04:37.360 --> 04:39.010
Was the wife knocking on the motel door.

04:39.180 --> 04:42.430
I know. He's so sweet. Every single saturday night

04:42.590 --> 04:45.110
We make an ice cream sundae bar and we watch old movies.

04:45.290 --> 04:46.960
Well,i can't tempt you and henry to come out

04:47.130 --> 04:49.900
With stuart and i to this movie premiere

04:50.060 --> 04:51.900
For which i have passes. (Gasps)

04:52.030 --> 04:54.780
"27 dresses." Shut up!

04:54.940 --> 04:58.040
I so want to see this movie. I love romantic comedies.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.640
And i love james marsden.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.500
I want to bake him naked and eat him for dessert.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.680
Okay,you and i have very different points of view

05:04.850 --> 05:06.520
Of romantic comedy. Yeah.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.430
But we couldn't go anyway.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.930
Henry and i are trying to do things

05:10.100 --> 05:11.500
That are just the two of us.

05:11.660 --> 05:15.630
He's leaving in 17 weeks and 4 days.

05:15.790 --> 05:18.000
Wait. Isn't this a leap year?

05:18.160 --> 05:20.240
(Gasps) 17 weeks and 5 days!

05:20.420 --> 05:22.750
I have to go tell him, give him a kiss! Go on. Go on.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.210
Wait!

05:24.380 --> 05:26.870
No,no,no. This is all wrong.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.770
You call this a cover,kiki?

05:28.940 --> 05:30.540
The goal is to make me look five years younger

05:30.690 --> 05:32.310
Than i say i am.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.120
Be prepared to work through lunch.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.540
Why aren't they working?

05:40.690 --> 05:41.850
Willie,a word.

05:42.030 --> 05:43.930
It's not that anyone minds being abused.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.640
It's just that they thought--

05:45.800 --> 05:47.510
And i don't know where they got this--

05:47.680 --> 05:52.350
That they were being paid to be abused.

05:52.740 --> 05:55.040
So this is about money? Well...

05:55.220 --> 05:57.820
In my day,we worked hard, and we were lucky if we got...

05:58.000 --> 06:01.220
(Raises voice) a cheese sandwich
and a cup of bad coffee.

06:01.380 --> 06:02.600
You were a senator's daughter

06:02.760 --> 06:05.030
And went to boarding school in paris.

06:05.210 --> 06:06.300
(Normal voice) i've never realized

06:06.470 --> 06:09.200
What tiny features you have.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.600
Oh.

06:11.630 --> 06:14.450
People,i heard there's some grumblings about money.

06:14.620 --> 06:17.230
Well,this afternoon, i'm meeting with our investors,

06:17.390 --> 06:20.110
And i'm absolutely certain we will have our funding.

06:20.270 --> 06:24.670
Then,"slater"... will be a go.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.730
You didn't order enough paper clips.

06:31.900 --> 06:33.890
Calm down. You're hysterical.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.860
You're practically screaming like a woman.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.790
Why are you in charge of anything?

06:37.950 --> 06:38.950
There's,like, a thousands sticks

06:39.120 --> 06:42.310
Of glitter glue and no paper clips. You're gay,right?

06:42.480 --> 06:44.420
Only when it comes to you.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.830
I shouldn't have to ask the receptionist

06:47.050 --> 06:47.790
For a paper clip.

06:47.960 --> 06:49.370
Okay,slow down there, spanky.

06:49.540 --> 06:51.740
You,my friend, are not the only one

06:51.910 --> 06:53.810
Who needs paper clips.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:04.480 --> 07:07.150
What? Metallics are back in this year.

07:07.330 --> 07:09.550
That is a misuse of company property.

07:09.710 --> 07:13.160
And that... is a misuse of hair gel.

07:13.330 --> 07:14.450
How much are you wearing?

07:14.630 --> 07:15.680
That's it.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.510
You just pissed off the pep.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.690
(Whimpers) no!

07:20.980 --> 07:21.820
I'm sorry,ma'am,

07:21.990 --> 07:24.360
But this thing is not allowed in the building.

07:24.530 --> 07:26.850
You can pick it up in the lobby on your way out.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.570
Will you walk him?

07:28.880 --> 07:29.630
(Chuckles) no.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.200
No!

07:37.780 --> 07:38.870
You guys are out of paper clips,

07:39.040 --> 07:40.470
But there's a butt-Load of glitter glue.

07:40.630 --> 07:42.480
I took some for my son.

07:43.650 --> 07:44.870
(Lowers voice) did that guy just check out my ass?

07:45.040 --> 07:47.160
How much does he make? Ugh,not enough to be worth it,

07:47.330 --> 07:48.410
But hey,you're starting to notice

07:48.580 --> 07:51.480
Guys check out your ass again. I can't even focus on guys right now.

07:51.640 --> 07:55.410
I gotta focus on opening up my salon. Hilda,i said you could make a few color copies,

07:55.580 --> 07:58.630
Not ransack the office supplies. No,no,no, they factor that in.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.440
Believe me, if i didn't take these,

08:00.600 --> 08:02.330
The books wouldn't line up at the end of the year.

08:02.510 --> 08:07.140
Look. Check it out. "Hilda's beautilities-- I give good hair."

08:07.300 --> 08:08.840
Ooh,that's a little smutty.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.470
You might get some of those guys in front of the liquor store. Hey,their money's good.

08:12.650 --> 08:15.020
Ay, betty,i got such a good feeling about this salon.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.410
When i heard that beauty school burned down

08:16.580 --> 08:19.010
And was selling a slightly damaged shampoo sink,

08:19.180 --> 08:22.320
I really felt like god was looking out for me. Well, you're gonna be amazing.

08:22.470 --> 08:23.710
Oh,and henry's coming by tomorrow

08:23.880 --> 08:25.860
With his "time life" books to install the sink.

08:26.030 --> 08:28.180
Ay, i still gotta get that thing home.

08:28.350 --> 08:29.220
Hey,do you think your little friend

08:29.400 --> 08:30.610
With the van could do it?

08:30.790 --> 08:35.260
Are you still hating him now or what? Who? Gio? No,we're fine. He'll be happy to do it.

08:35.429 --> 08:39.380
Investors! How could they have turned me down? That's not what they said.

08:39.539 --> 08:41.120
They just need a few days to think about it.

08:41.289 --> 08:43.059
Oh,that means "no." Don't be stupid.

08:43.230 --> 08:45.260
"Image problem." I don't have an image problem.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.570
Well,you have had some pretty bad press lately.

08:48.750 --> 08:51.550
Well,you were fired and pushed into your fianc?S grave.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.750
I don't know how to put a positive spin on that.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.320
Well,then we're screwed,marc.

08:55.490 --> 08:56.110
They're the only investors

08:56.280 --> 08:57.460
Willing to launch a new magazine,

08:57.620 --> 09:01.250
And they think i have an image problem. Well,then,we change your image. Come on.

09:01.420 --> 09:02.740
It's the media age. We can do it overnight.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.760
Britney spears shaves something or shows something

09:04.930 --> 09:05.750
Or shows something shaved,

09:05.920 --> 09:08.060
And it's around the world in seconds. Trust me,lady.

09:08.220 --> 09:11.190
I can make you mother teresa with better boobs.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.520
It's interesting.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.500
You only call me when you need something.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.010
When was the last time you went down

09:18.180 --> 09:19.610
To my deli and bought a sandwich?

09:19.790 --> 09:22.100
Well,gio,that's because every time i come in,you yell,

09:22.260 --> 09:25.860
"There she is--The eater." It's cute. It's our thing.

09:26.030 --> 09:29.860
Gio,you gotta let me pay you. I don't feel right. Just give my mom a haircut

09:30.040 --> 09:31.800
And don't tell her about her bald spot.

09:31.970 --> 09:34.020
Um,gio,you can just set the sink down over there.

09:34.180 --> 09:35.340
Henry's coming to install it.

09:35.490 --> 09:39.890
A man of many talents. Is there anything egg salad can't do?

09:40.060 --> 09:41.540
Why is henry egg salad?

09:41.710 --> 09:43.230
Because egg salad is a boring sandwich,

09:43.410 --> 09:47.740
And gio thinks that henry is boring. Oh,no,henry's not boring.

09:47.910 --> 09:49.360
No,look at all the cool stuff you guys do.

09:49.520 --> 09:52.050
I mean,your,um, saturday night sundae night.

09:52.210 --> 09:54.700
That sounds like fun. It is. It is so much fun.

09:54.850 --> 09:56.520
Every weekend, we have a theme topping.

09:56.690 --> 09:58.770
Like,last week,we were watching "walk the line"--

09:58.950 --> 10:02.790
You know,about johnny cash-- So he chopped up cashews. (Laughs)

10:03.240 --> 10:04.920
It was fun. It was fun.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.360
And did you eat it with a reese witherspoon? (Laughs)

10:08.970 --> 10:11.680
That's funny. He's funny. Yeah,he's a riot.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.940
I'm just kidding, but come on.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.920
You and henry,have,like, what,four months left,

10:17.080 --> 10:18.780
And this is how you spend a saturday night?

10:18.950 --> 10:21.500
Okay,gio, what would you do?

10:29.050 --> 10:30.950
If i loved a girl,

10:31.110 --> 10:33.700
And i knew i had so little time left with her,

10:33.860 --> 10:36.740
Then every night would be a chance to make a memory.

10:36.910 --> 10:40.160
Believe me,if there was any ice cream involved,

10:40.320 --> 10:41.960
I would be eating it off her stomach.

10:42.130 --> 10:43.080
Sexy. Gross.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.060
And i'd take her out to montauk,

10:45.180 --> 10:46.260
You know, with a bottle of wine,

10:46.440 --> 10:49.160
And we'd build a fire and sleep on the beach.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.190
Or maybe we'd climb the fire escape

10:51.360 --> 10:52.820
To the rooftop of the blue note

10:52.990 --> 10:54.560
And listen to music.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.420
Maybe we'd just go out dancing.

10:57.730 --> 11:00.700
'Cause,you know,you never feel closer to a woman

11:00.860 --> 11:02.250
Than when you're holding her.

11:02.410 --> 11:04.430
You know,like,mm,

11:04.600 --> 11:07.750
So close that you could feel her breath on your neck.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.990
Because love doesn't come around often,

11:11.160 --> 11:14.930
And i'd want to make every second count.

11:18.770 --> 11:21.250
Man,i love this song. Aw,whoo!

11:21.410 --> 11:22.720
Come on,betty.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.450
No. Gio.

11:24.610 --> 11:26.140
I don't want to dance. Mmm.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.500
We have to work. Hilda,we have to work. (Hilda) what?

11:29.670 --> 11:30.690
Come on. A little bit of dancing.

11:30.850 --> 11:32.510
Come on. Ready? One,two.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.910
One,two,mm,mm.

11:35.060 --> 11:37.360
There you go. You got it. You got it.

11:38.060 --> 11:40.540
(Laughs) oh,hey, you guys are good together.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.440
Yeah. Really good.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.460
Doesn't really match the figure "b."

12:03.600 --> 12:04.900
You wanna take another look?

12:05.050 --> 12:08.380
Why were you dancing with that guy? I don't know. He just grabbed me.

12:08.540 --> 12:10.470
He was just showing us some dance moves.

12:10.760 --> 12:11.700
(Clinks) damn it.

12:11.870 --> 12:15.360
It's not that big a deal. What? No,it's this,like-- I can't get this pipe to fit.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.840
Need some help there? What? No. I got it.

12:18.010 --> 12:20.710
Yeah,i see you've got your,um,"time life" books.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.110
Yep. Henry uses them all the time.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.200
He says they were his best friends growing up.

12:25.350 --> 12:26.490
I didn't say it like that.

12:26.660 --> 12:27.610
You know,i think where you're going wrong

12:27.770 --> 12:30.740
Is you didn't slip the trap nut and washer onto the tailpiece

12:30.870 --> 12:33.320
Before you attached the p-Trap. Yes,thank you.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.040
Henry,i think you should let gio do it.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.960
That p-Trap thingy sounds hard. Hilda,he says he can do it.

12:40.130 --> 12:42.510
Yes,i can.

12:42.940 --> 12:44.910
There. It's done.

12:45.070 --> 12:46.470
Okay.

12:48.470 --> 12:49.390
Henry!

12:54.250 --> 12:55.540
Uh,you okay?

12:55.710 --> 12:58.310
No,no. It's supposed to do that.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.200
It says so in the book.

13:01.290 --> 13:02.980
Surprise,surprise.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.060
The devil donates prada.

13:05.230 --> 13:06.690
Wilhelmina slater  spent the day

13:06.860 --> 13:09.310
Clothing the homeless,  making our city beautiful

13:09.470 --> 13:12.050
And even comforting the sick.

13:12.210 --> 13:15.410
* rise and shine and give god  your glory,glory *

13:15.560 --> 13:18.560
* rise and shine and give  god your glory,glory *

13:18.730 --> 13:21.930
* rise and shine and give god  your glory,glory *

13:22.100 --> 13:24.790
* children of the lord *

13:24.940 --> 13:27.390
It's like eleanor roosevelt  has come back to life

13:27.540 --> 13:29.010
As a woman.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.510
From the antichrist  to "auntie mame"...

13:31.660 --> 13:34.530
"Slater." One moment.

13:34.700 --> 13:36.660
It's the investors.

13:38.670 --> 13:40.560
Paul,hello.

13:41.170 --> 13:44.860
Oh,you saw that. Well,i'm mortified.

13:45.020 --> 13:48.460
Y--They just showed up with cameras and ambushed me.

13:48.630 --> 13:50.270
Well, what can i say?

13:50.440 --> 13:53.640
Now everyone knows the real wilhelmina.

13:54.820 --> 13:56.570
He turned off the video?

13:56.740 --> 13:58.880
Oh,your father and cameras...

13:59.040 --> 14:01.250
I remember when he set a camera up in the bedroom.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.380
We got a half hour of a moaning lamp.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.310
Yeah,mom. We found that tape.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.680
So,mom, are you okay?

14:07.850 --> 14:10.770
How are they treating you there? Oh,i'm fine. I think i have

14:10.920 --> 14:14.000
A little more cache this time,being an escapee.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.180
The bulls are giving me a wider berth.

14:16.340 --> 14:18.780
Okay,mom,we're really happy you're top dog there,

14:18.950 --> 14:20.700
But we really need to talk about your hearing.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.970
We're thinking you should plead

14:22.130 --> 14:23.830
T guilty by reason of insanity.

14:24.010 --> 14:25.870
Wait,we said i was gonna tell her that.

14:26.780 --> 14:29.250
Mom,hi. We need to sit down with the attorneys and--

14:29.410 --> 14:31.100
Give me that. I'm talking to her.

14:31.260 --> 14:34.110
Are we really doing this again? Yes,we are.

14:34.260 --> 14:36.310
(Claire) kids-- Mom,didn't dad used to call me "my daniel"?

14:36.480 --> 14:37.850
Kids-- Maybe he used to call you my dumb-Ass.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.720
Children! Put me on the speakerphone.

14:42.270 --> 14:43.540
There is a woman named hatchet in here

14:43.700 --> 14:45.850
Who gets out tomorrow, and i swear to god,

14:46.010 --> 14:47.110
If the two of you do not cut it out,

14:47.280 --> 14:49.400
I will send her to get you.

14:49.970 --> 14:51.880
Now your father is gone,

14:52.620 --> 14:54.830
And i may be gone for a very long time.

14:54.980 --> 14:56.080
You two are on your own now,

14:56.240 --> 14:58.330
And it is time to grow up.

14:58.490 --> 14:59.570
There is a business to be run.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.240
This is not the tree house you fought over

15:01.390 --> 15:04.800
When you were 12. Work it out.

15:06.610 --> 15:08.470
Daniel, let's get real.

15:08.630 --> 15:10.190
We both know who dad wanted.

15:10.710 --> 15:11.430
(Scoffs) we don't know that.

15:11.590 --> 15:13.980
The video got cut off. Then how do you propose we solve this?

15:14.140 --> 15:17.130
Lawyers? Arbitrators? What about what mom said?

15:17.300 --> 15:21.900
Grow up? That won't work. No. The way we settled the tree house.

15:22.060 --> 15:23.920
This is a billion-Dollar company,daniel.

15:24.070 --> 15:25.170
We're not gonna choose a president

15:25.340 --> 15:26.770
With a paintball war.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.870
Well,dad wanted someone with a killer instinct.

15:29.030 --> 15:29.950
Forget it.

15:30.110 --> 15:31.570
Why? Are you afraid i might win again,

15:31.730 --> 15:34.060
Like i did with the tree house?

15:39.330 --> 15:40.970
You're on.

15:41.510 --> 15:42.710
See what i did here?

15:42.870 --> 15:44.440
I mixed a little bit of prep

15:44.590 --> 15:45.920
With a little bit of gangsta,

15:46.070 --> 15:47.790
And i found an edge where there was none.

15:47.960 --> 15:51.810
I don't know. Can i really rock this look? Betty?

15:51.970 --> 15:54.920
Um,i like the color.

15:55.550 --> 15:57.110
Henry,your clothes will be dry in 20 minutes,

15:57.280 --> 15:59.450
And,uh,you can just keep my boxers.

15:59.610 --> 16:00.530
You guys are not gonna believe

16:00.700 --> 16:01.810
What i just did.

16:01.970 --> 16:04.310
I asked gio out. What?

16:04.460 --> 16:06.800
Yeah,we're gonna go dancing.

16:06.970 --> 16:10.360
Oh,henry. It's cute.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.080
Really? Gio?

16:12.230 --> 16:14.060
I mean,don't you find him a little annoying?

16:14.230 --> 16:15.380
Oh,i think he's fun.

16:15.550 --> 16:16.460
Besides,you're the one who keeps saying

16:16.620 --> 16:18.740
That i should go out. Good move,mija.

16:18.900 --> 16:21.790
It will be nice to have someone around the house who's so handy.

16:22.640 --> 16:26.940
I mean,when we're not calling henry to--To fix things. Yeah.

16:27.950 --> 16:29.740
I'm out.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.400
I don't know,hilda.

16:32.570 --> 16:34.120
I think he's a little bit of a know-It-All.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.990
I think it's great,hilda. Eh,i'm on the fence.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.450
All done.

16:42.150 --> 16:43.660
Just be home by 11:00.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.750
Ow! What?

16:46.310 --> 16:48.870
So,hilda, you like reggaeton music?

16:49.020 --> 16:50.950
Are you kidding? I love reggaeton.

16:51.120 --> 16:54.100
Oh,man,i know this hot club with this amazing deejay.

16:54.260 --> 16:56.920
It is off the hook. God,that sounds like so much fun.

16:57.080 --> 17:00.290
Yeah,that does sound like fun. Hey,do you guys wanna come?

17:00.450 --> 17:02.590
Um... we have plans.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.520
Uh,we have plans. Uh,my boyfriend has

17:04.690 --> 17:05.900
A really big surprise for me.

17:06.060 --> 17:11.030
Yeah,it's off the hook,too. Really?

17:11.390 --> 17:14.910
Tonight,instead of just  having ice cream...

17:16.420 --> 17:18.520
We're gonna make it.

17:19.569 --> 17:21.109
Cool.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.140
* i'm your ice cream man *

17:29.300 --> 17:32.060
* stop me when you're passin' by *

17:32.230 --> 17:33.560
* see, now all my flavors *

17:33.740 --> 17:36.900
* are guaranteed to satisfy *

17:37.040 --> 17:38.110
Here you go.

17:38.270 --> 17:42.480
One scoop of homemade "bananas for betty."

17:42.650 --> 17:44.050
You named it after me?

17:44.220 --> 17:46.900
Mm-Hmm. How sweet.

17:47.990 --> 17:49.750
Mm,the movie.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.340
I rented fassbinder's

17:51.510 --> 17:54.030
"The bitter tears of petra von kant"

17:54.200 --> 17:55.890
Because you are seriously lacking

17:56.040 --> 17:57.930
In your knowledge of new german cinema.

17:58.110 --> 18:01.540
And to go with it, bitter chocolate drops

18:01.710 --> 18:03.510
To represent the bitter tears

18:03.700 --> 18:06.250
Of our sad german heroine.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.510
(Laughs) hey,you okay?

18:09.670 --> 18:10.640
Yeah.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.610
But you know what i was thinking?

18:12.800 --> 18:13.480
What?

18:13.620 --> 18:15.790
You know what would be really fun? Hmm?

18:15.960 --> 18:18.130
If we climbed a fire escape. (Laughs)

18:18.290 --> 18:21.570
Or--Or maybe we could go to the pier. Tonight?

18:21.730 --> 18:23.000
Yeah. Why not?

18:23.160 --> 18:24.720
Because it's supposed to rain and it's mov night.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.670
What are you talking about?

18:27.610 --> 18:29.450
I don't know. Never mind.

18:29.620 --> 18:31.440
Um,forget it. You're right.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.700
Let's,um,sit on the couch and eat our ice cream.

18:34.870 --> 18:35.970
Good.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.060
But maybe there's a more fun way to eat it.

19:19.830 --> 19:21.440
The rules are simple--

19:21.680 --> 19:23.060
We fight to the death.

19:23.220 --> 19:25.660
The captain of the winning team takes control of meade.

19:25.810 --> 19:27.600
Okay,peeps, as captain--

19:27.770 --> 19:29.340
You're not captain.

19:29.630 --> 19:30.850
As backup captain,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.940
I wanna say that we are all brothers in this,

19:34.090 --> 19:35.540
Even the chicks.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.720
So,warriors, to your ducatis.

19:38.870 --> 19:41.430
Yeah,we rented a bus to take us to the paintball field.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.800
Not as cool.

19:42.950 --> 19:44.350
Let's go.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.530
You wait,pepper.

19:47.700 --> 19:50.530
You're gonna taste the wrath of my dog's vengeance.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.310
You don't even know what "wrath" means.

19:53.480 --> 19:56.530
So. I know you're gonna taste it.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.080
You know,i think this is one of those things

20:06.220 --> 20:07.130
That's better in theory,

20:07.280 --> 20:09.300
Because they really don't tell you how cold it is.

20:09.460 --> 20:12.010
Oh,okay. Well,i'll just eat it fast then.

20:12.170 --> 20:15.370
Oh,god. Okay,um--

20:15.540 --> 20:16.140
Okay, just do something,

20:16.300 --> 20:17.860
Because my belly button is frozen.

20:18.020 --> 20:22.310
All right,then maybe this will warm you up.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.330
Ow! Oh!

20:23.470 --> 20:26.580
Oh,no,it's hot! Hot fudge! Hot! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

20:26.740 --> 20:29.470
Aah! (Muffled voice) it's hot. It's hot. (Groaning) this is...

20:29.630 --> 20:32.480
I can't feel my tongue. This is crazy.

20:32.630 --> 20:36.320
How is this better than the night that i planned? (Normal voice) i don't know.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.820
I just wanted to try something different. Well,this is different.

20:39.980 --> 20:42.240
Henry,it's just that we have

20:42.400 --> 20:44.290
So ltle time left together,

20:44.460 --> 20:46.650
And--And i--And i feel like we're not making the best of it.

20:46.810 --> 20:49.500
It's like,why are we sitting at home

20:49.670 --> 20:51.910
When we could be out there...

20:52.170 --> 20:54.310
Dancing or something?

20:54.460 --> 20:55.940
Dancing?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.770
Like gio and hilda?

21:00.250 --> 21:02.330
Well,why not?

21:03.700 --> 21:07.760
Henry,i-I just-- I want us to have memories.

21:07.930 --> 21:09.390
Okay.

21:10.430 --> 21:12.810
If that's what you really want,

21:14.250 --> 21:16.400
We'll go dancing.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.480
All right,there's another rainstorm coming.

21:20.660 --> 21:21.580
They closed the paintball field.

21:21.750 --> 21:24.530
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to postpone this. No way.

21:24.710 --> 21:27.220
I totally had my heart set on killing nick pepper.

21:27.380 --> 21:30.030
Damn,dawg. Accounting was finally gonna represent.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.920
Forget the rain. We're playing.

21:33.090 --> 21:34.550
She's right.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.950
She's alexis-- Big as texas.

21:37.110 --> 21:39.060
She knows what it's like to be both sexes.

21:40.120 --> 21:43.260
I can't listen to that for the next three hours.

21:44.010 --> 21:46.080
Here's the deal-- We're playing.

21:46.340 --> 21:47.780
Now! (Gunfire)

21:47.950 --> 21:49.770
Aw 'em out! Shoot to kill!

21:49.930 --> 21:52.500
Uh,do what she said, only for me. Come on.

21:55.370 --> 21:57.520
What bar are we meeting up at later?

22:00.880 --> 22:01.930
I'm very pleased,marc.

22:02.100 --> 22:02.830
By this time next week,

22:03.000 --> 22:04.500
"Slater" magazine will have its funding.

22:04.650 --> 22:05.970
And i'll get paid. (Chuckles)

22:06.120 --> 22:08.670
I think i'll start eating breakfast again. (Thunder rumbles)

22:08.840 --> 22:10.670
Oh,damn,it looks like it's gonna rain.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.700
Run up and get my umbrella.

22:11.870 --> 22:13.030
I'll meet you at the restaurant.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.570
You're not gonna wait?

22:14.740 --> 22:15.650
No.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.620
(Woman) taxi.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.680
Excuse me. I was here first.

22:24.850 --> 22:27.590
Midtown nobu,please. Well,you're very rude.

22:27.750 --> 22:29.990
And you're wearing plastic. I'm gonna be late.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.170
And i'm gonna get wet.

22:31.320 --> 22:34.570
I'm wilhelmina slater. I don't get wet. Ow! Oh!

22:34.740 --> 22:35.720
Oh. (Whimpers)

22:36.310 --> 22:38.440
Oh. Ohh.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.020
That should take care of it.

22:45.330 --> 22:48.040
Oh,my god. It's betty white.

22:48.210 --> 22:50.400
Yes,it's betty white, jackass.

22:50.560 --> 22:53.530
I'm on the ground here. Call 9-1-1.

22:53.680 --> 22:54.660
They're on their way,

22:54.810 --> 22:57.370
And dot worry-- I got it all on my cell.

22:57.530 --> 22:59.670
You know,you're our favorite golden girl.

22:59.830 --> 23:00.770

23:00.940 --> 23:02.620

We thought we'd take you up on your offer.

23:25.060 --> 23:26.990
Are you having fun? Hell,yeah.

23:27.170 --> 23:30.990
The restaurant was amazing. I had four champagne cocktails,

23:31.140 --> 23:34.520
And i don't even feel drunk. Let me get us a round of drinks.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.660
No,no. I'll get 'em. I'll get 'em. I got it.

23:36.820 --> 23:40.700
Somebody get 'em, because i don't feel anything.
A round of flaming pelicans,please.

23:40.850 --> 23:43.000
Oh,no. I don't want a flaming pelican.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.100
Why--Why not? They sound fun. Have one.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.870
It's okay. Um,i'm gonna have a club soda.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.760
No,get him a flaming thing.

23:48.900 --> 23:49.690
It'll loosen you up.

23:49.860 --> 23:53.380
And then gio can show you some of those fancy dance moves.

23:54.060 --> 23:54.940
I'm good.

23:55.110 --> 23:56.840
So,hilda, how about you let me

23:57.000 --> 23:59.470
Throw you around the dance floor? Sure.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.500
Hey,uh, are you guys coming?

24:02.680 --> 24:04.100

We'll dance on the next one.

24:18.370 --> 24:19.750

24:20.010 --> 24:20.800
Okay,here's the plan--

24:20.960 --> 24:22.320

24:24.640 --> 24:26.380
Amanda,i want you to cover the bull pen.

24:26.530 --> 24:29.090
I want the closet. No,you're gonna steal shoes.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.560
Now,you guys, i'm really confident

24:30.720 --> 24:32.000
We have a winning team.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.390
Aah!

24:35.500 --> 24:36.760
(Amanda) cover me!

24:36.910 --> 24:38.950

24:58.040 --> 25:00.230
Oh,i was hit. I'm out.

25:00.390 --> 25:02.080
Oh,i'm out,too.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.480
(Woman) now it's just daniel and amanda.

25:13.240 --> 25:16.120
Oh,hello. What's with all the stalkerazzi?

25:16.280 --> 25:18.430
Ah,the world in which we live in.

25:18.590 --> 25:20.380
Guess they found out about the news about "slater."

25:20.560 --> 25:22.510
How are my teeth? Sharp as ever.

25:23.470 --> 25:25.920
All right. Uh, the official announcement

25:26.090 --> 25:27.530
For "slater" won't be for a couple months,

25:27.680 --> 25:30.190
But i'll be happy to answer any questions.

25:30.350 --> 25:33.290
Wilhelmina,why do you hate betty white?

25:33.650 --> 25:34.440
I'm sorry?

25:34.600 --> 25:37.240
The woman's a national treasure. What do you have against her?

25:37.820 --> 25:40.250
Uh,i have nothing against her.

25:40.420 --> 25:43.280
Then why did you viciously attack her?

25:43.440 --> 25:45.500
Marc,they're yelling things at me

25:45.650 --> 25:47.690
And getting-- Getting very close.

25:47.860 --> 25:49.810
I'm wilhelmina slater.  I don't get wet.

25:49.970 --> 25:51.700
Tv legend betty white's  high five

25:51.860 --> 25:53.120
Was reduced  to a high four

25:53.290 --> 25:55.120
After fashion diva  wilhelmina slater

25:55.270 --> 25:58.500
Slammed her hand  in a car door tonight. Ouch!

25:58.670 --> 25:59.960
Willie,how could you?

26:00.130 --> 26:01.950
Uh,well, obviously i didn't know

26:02.120 --> 26:03.250
It was betty white.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.940
I'm not a monster.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.830
I just thought it was some old woman in the rain.

26:07.010 --> 26:09.220
By now you've all seen  the footage on youtube,

26:09.380 --> 26:12.470
But i can't see it enough.  (Snorts) can you?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.220
What in the world...

26:20.370 --> 26:20.870
Oh,god.

26:21.010 --> 26:23.770
This thing has had 50,000 hits in the last hour.

26:23.930 --> 26:27.240
Some queen's even remixed it to a dance song.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.790
Oh! Ooh! Oh!

26:29.950 --> 26:31.390
I'm wilhelmina slater.  I don't get wet.

26:31.550 --> 26:33.410
I don't get wet.  Wilhelmina slater.

26:33.570 --> 26:35.260
I don't get wet.  Ooh!

26:35.410 --> 26:37.310
You're wearing plastic... funky.

26:37.460 --> 26:39.830
Oh,this is bad,willie, really bad.

26:40.000 --> 26:40.960
I'm wilhelmina slater.  I don't get wet...

26:41.140 --> 26:44.300
This is a disaster. "Slater" is ruined,

26:44.470 --> 26:45.520
And i may have spent an afternoon

26:45.670 --> 26:48.190
Touching homeless people for nothing.

26:48.630 --> 26:49.530
Well,maybe it's still okay.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.970
Maybe the investors haven't seen it.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.150
(Whimpers) oh,god.

27:07.950 --> 27:09.770
No,no,no. It's me.

27:10.010 --> 27:10.990
Oh.

27:15.850 --> 27:18.020
It was an anna sui.

27:18.180 --> 27:21.490
I know i should feel something, but i feel nothing.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.370
War has changed me.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.540
Hang in there. We're doing good.

27:24.700 --> 27:28.150
I just shot stella in the ladies' room. And karen went home because she got bored.

27:28.300 --> 27:29.350
See? That counts.

27:29.510 --> 27:32.150
We only have alexis and nick left.

27:32.390 --> 27:37.410
S with singsongy voice) danny,come out and play.

27:38.110 --> 27:39.900
Daniel,this is out of control.

27:40.060 --> 27:41.290
Maybe we should just give up.

27:41.450 --> 27:43.600
Innocent clothes are getting hurt.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.090
No. We're not going anywhere.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.780
Alexis always wins everything.

27:48.050 --> 27:49.610
You know,she even got to say good-Bye

27:49.780 --> 27:52.050
To my father in the end, and i didn't.

27:52.210 --> 27:54.690
She's not getting this.

27:54.860 --> 27:56.220
Amanda,

27:56.370 --> 27:58.030
Are you with me?

27:58.210 --> 28:00.150
Yes,i am.

28:00.320 --> 28:01.260
Eyes on the prize.

28:01.420 --> 28:04.050
You take nick. I have alexis.

28:04.670 --> 28:05.440

28:09.310 --> 28:10.920
* back it,back it up,  back it up *

28:13.750 --> 28:14.830
Wow.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.920
They look like they're having a lot of fun.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.400
Yeah come on,henry, let's dance.

28:20.570 --> 28:21.490
Betty, you've seen me dance.

28:21.650 --> 28:23.810
I don't want to look like a fool. Oh,who cares?

28:23.980 --> 28:24.960
Gio doesn't care what he looks like.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.200
Come on. It'll be fun. Maybe i don't want to be fun.

28:27.380 --> 28:29.080
Oh,my gosh,henry, your shirt!

28:29.250 --> 28:29.840
Oh,my god. Uh,yes.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.880
Somebody help him.

28:34.960 --> 28:35.840
(Man) hey!

28:36.010 --> 28:36.890
I'm sorry.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.460
Did my catching on fire interrupt your date?

28:41.640 --> 28:42.120
Are you okay?

28:42.290 --> 28:46.070
Betty,what are we even doing here? I-I just wanted us to dance.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.500
Well,if you want to dance so badly,

28:47.670 --> 28:49.270
Then--Then go and dance with gio,

28:49.430 --> 28:52.300
Because i'm never gonna be that guy.

29:01.380 --> 29:02.640
Stop tormenting us!

29:03.090 --> 29:04.600
Oh,just answer it. (Ring)

29:04.770 --> 29:06.170
Let them pull the funding. I'm done.

29:06.330 --> 29:08.270
I can't fight for "slater" any longer. (Ring)

29:08.910 --> 29:10.130
"Slater."

29:11.130 --> 29:12.070
Oh.

29:12.610 --> 29:14.210
It's betty white's publicist.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.280
Yes,she'll speak to betty.

29:17.450 --> 29:18.580
At does she want? I don't know.

29:18.740 --> 29:19.710
What do i say? I don't know.

29:19.870 --> 29:21.690
How do i look? It's a phone.

29:22.180 --> 29:24.360
Betty white, how are you?

29:24.530 --> 29:26.730
Well,for someone who had to fight a rat

29:26.900 --> 29:29.230
For her fingertip, surprisingly well.

29:29.390 --> 29:30.980
Well,i didn't vote for giuliani,

29:31.140 --> 29:33.380
But he did make the city cleaner.

29:34.570 --> 29:36.680
Betty,i can't begin to tell you

29:36.840 --> 29:38.820
How sorry i am.

29:38.990 --> 29:41.450
Believe me,i-- I just thought

29:41.600 --> 29:42.490
You were some old lady.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.630
Oh,an honest mistake.

29:44.790 --> 29:46.100
And i'll be fine.

29:46.250 --> 29:49.030
I did lose a lot of blood, but it was my own fault.

29:49.190 --> 29:51.520
I stopped to sign a few autographs

29:51.680 --> 29:54.540
And almost bled out on the sidewalk.

29:54.700 --> 29:56.350
Well,that's why you're beloved--

29:56.500 --> 29:57.820
You're loyal to your fans.

29:57.980 --> 30:00.790
Oh,well, i adore 'em...

30:00.960 --> 30:02.330
Except for the few sickos

30:02.490 --> 30:03.910
Who write lesbian fan fiction

30:04.080 --> 30:05.940
About me and bea arthur.

30:06.110 --> 30:08.720
Look,i know you must feel terrible.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.730
That's why i'm calling you--

30:10.890 --> 30:13.410
To tell you i forgive you.

30:13.570 --> 30:17.610
Really? Well, that's wonderful.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.780
Well,i feel better,

30:19.960 --> 30:23.300
But you know how you can help heal the city?

30:23.510 --> 30:26.850
You can forgive me on tv.

30:37.180 --> 30:38.580
Looking for me?

30:40.480 --> 30:41.390
(Grunts) damn it.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.710
That was for halston.

30:44.050 --> 30:45.490
Aah.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.190
Ow! That hurts.

30:47.350 --> 30:49.450
And that was for not holding the elevator.

30:49.620 --> 30:51.770
(Grunts) and that is for not making the coffee.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.560
And that is for wearing yellow spandex--

30:54.730 --> 30:56.480
Okay,i'm dead. I'm dead.

30:56.670 --> 30:58.570
I will tell you when you are dead.

30:59.730 --> 31:01.460
(Grunts) you are a psycho.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.880
And you are a dog hater!

31:04.050 --> 31:06.960
God,you're hot when you're mad. And you're hot when you're dead

31:11.390 --> 31:13.000
Oh,amanda. (Gasps)

31:18.420 --> 31:19.650
Eh.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.180
(Amanda) mm. I hate you.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.450
Mm. Mm. Oh!

31:25.980 --> 31:28.240
And then there was one.

31:35.130 --> 31:36.700
Henry,it's me.

31:36.870 --> 31:39.740
Um,i know you're ignoring my calls right now,

31:39.900 --> 31:41.900
Because you're not so bananas for betty.

31:42.050 --> 31:45.730
I mean,why would you be? I'm not either.

31:45.890 --> 31:48.360
I just wanted to say...

31:48.510 --> 31:50.470
Nted to say...

31:50.810 --> 31:54.160
I gotta go. You're dancing right now.

32:14.070 --> 32:15.410
(Harold melvin  & the blue notes) * if you *

32:15.580 --> 32:16.610
* don't know me by now *

32:16.760 --> 32:20.120
* if you don't  know me by now *

32:20.500 --> 32:24.370
* you will never,never,  never know me *

32:24.530 --> 32:26.660
* you'll never,  never,never know me *

32:26.810 --> 32:29.340
* ooh,ooh,ooh *  * hey,hey *

32:29.550 --> 32:32.830
* if you don't know me  by now *  * if you don't *

32:33.000 --> 32:33.900
(Man) * oh *

32:43.980 --> 32:45.110
Betty,i'm sorry.

32:45.250 --> 32:46.530
I-I was acting like such a jerk.

32:46.700 --> 32:47.880
I just got jealous.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.040
Look,i-I'm never gonna be like gio.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.300
Gettin' my freak on doesn't come naturally.

32:52.460 --> 32:53.900
Stop.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.410
I don't want you to be like gio,

32:56.560 --> 32:57.970
And i don't need to come to clubs

32:58.670 --> 33:01.240
And i don't need to eat food off of you.

33:01.390 --> 33:03.380
I just want to be with you.

33:03.910 --> 33:06.070
I want to be with you.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.550
I have 17 weeks and 3 days left

33:09.710 --> 33:12.260
With the most amazing guy in the world,

33:12.420 --> 33:15.050
And i'm happy eating ice cream on the couch

33:15.210 --> 33:16.540
Out of a bowl.

33:17.290 --> 33:21.350
Henry,wow. What can i say,man?

33:21.520 --> 33:23.360
You have the moves of a jungle cat.

33:23.520 --> 33:27.350
Yeah,henry,where have you been hiding that?

33:28.130 --> 33:29.050
(Gio) well, so who's drinking?

33:29.210 --> 33:30.590
I am!

33:30.920 --> 33:32.380
You know,i think they water these down.

33:32.550 --> 33:33.800
I'm just sayin'. (Gio laughs)

33:34.880 --> 33:39.020
Oh,hey,uh, you guys comin'?

33:39.860 --> 33:41.660
I think we're going home.

33:47.710 --> 33:49.450
Later.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.090
Owdamn it!

34:20.250 --> 34:21.900
Alexis, are you all right?

34:22.070 --> 34:22.960
Oh.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.780
What areou waiting for?

34:28.040 --> 34:30.469
Take the shot.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.190
What are we doing?

34:46.360 --> 34:49.520
Does it really matter who dad wanted to run meade?

34:50.400 --> 34:53.260
Why don't we do it together?

34:54.330 --> 34:57.370
I'm willing to if you are.

34:59.310 --> 35:01.750
I'd like that.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.060
(Panting) wh--

35:18.590 --> 35:21.610
I let you win the tree house,daniel,

35:21.780 --> 35:23.780
'Cause it didn't matter.

35:24.570 --> 35:27.650
But i'm not letting you win is.

35:38.730 --> 35:41.710
Maybe next saturday, i'll make the ice cream,

35:41.970 --> 35:45.200
And i'll call it "hazelnuts for henry."

35:46.360 --> 35:48.660
And when "27 dresses" comes out,

35:48.820 --> 35:51.570
I'll make you "chick flick chicken,"

35:51.720 --> 35:54.480
And we'll sit in the front row.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.640
As long as it's you and me,

35:56.800 --> 35:57.230
It's a date.

35:57.390 --> 36:02.480
* it illuminates my soul,  is inspired *

36:04.300 --> 36:10.890
* your eyes are wider  than before... *

36:13.170 --> 36:14.160
Oh,shh. Shh.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.440
Oh,shh. Shh. (Clears throat)

36:17.790 --> 36:19.110
I think i had too much too drink.

36:19.290 --> 36:22.300
Oh,you--You wanna go back to the club?

36:27.880 --> 36:28.660
So...

36:28.810 --> 36:29.480
So?

36:29.630 --> 36:34.010
Hey,do you,um,wanna do this again sometime?

36:35.770 --> 36:37.420
I don't think so.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.240
Oh,i had so much fun tonight.

36:39.410 --> 36:41.600
When henry caught on fire... (laughs) yeah.

36:41.760 --> 36:44.770
And everything,but,um, you just really seem

36:44.920 --> 36:47.070
To up your game when betty showed up.

36:47.220 --> 36:49.760
What? What--What are you talking about?

36:49.920 --> 36:51.820
I'm just saying...

36:52.450 --> 36:54.630
I don't think i'm the suarez sister you like.

36:54.790 --> 37:00.510
* oh,so much more *

37:01.550 --> 37:03.010
(Man) one minute to air.

37:03.210 --> 37:06.230
Now this is gonna be picked up by every major station.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.710
I can't thank you enough for doing this.

37:08.880 --> 37:10.230
You're a class act,lady.

37:10.400 --> 37:13.970
Oh,i just don't want to be part of the ugliness out there.

37:14.130 --> 37:18.260
As gandhi said,"be the change you want to see in the world."

37:18.410 --> 37:21.600
Oh,terrific. I'm going on tv with whore eyes.

37:21.760 --> 37:25.590
Okay,ladies. We're going live. Turn on that over-40 charm.

37:25.880 --> 37:29.140
And five,four, three,two...

37:29.290 --> 37:31.570
So much can change overnight.

37:31.740 --> 37:34.050
This is suzuki st. Pierre from "fashion buzz,"

37:34.210 --> 37:37.260
Here at the peace summit no one thought would ever happen.

37:37.420 --> 37:40.610
Wilhelmina,what do you have to say to award-Winning actress,

37:40.760 --> 37:43.400
Animal rights activist, friend to gays everywhere--

37:43.580 --> 37:44.820
I love you-- Me,too.

37:44.980 --> 37:45.990
Betty white.

37:46.130 --> 37:49.580
As i saito her last night when i rushed to her side,i--

37:49.750 --> 37:53.290
Oh! My hand! Oh,oh,it hurts. I barely--

37:53.460 --> 37:55.910
Now she's going after my other hand. Betty,please.

37:56.060 --> 37:59.250
Why do y hate me? What did i ever do to you? Please,betty.

37:59.420 --> 38:02.790
Oh,god! Get the monster away from me.

38:03.290 --> 38:04.680
Cut.

38:04.850 --> 38:07.250
What the hell is going on here?

38:07.410 --> 38:09.520
Have you lost your mind, old woman?

38:09.690 --> 38:12.340
Did i not mention that "regis and kelly" called?

38:12.490 --> 38:15.770
And "the view." They want me. They all want me.

38:16.110 --> 38:18.470
Oh,i'm sorry,honey. This feud is huge,

38:18.650 --> 38:20.920
And i'm gonna milk it till it's dry.

38:21.100 --> 38:23.050
But you don't need this.

38:23.210 --> 38:24.180
Are you kidding?

38:24.330 --> 38:27.430
That "golden girls" money went right into the nickel slots.

38:28.210 --> 38:29.950
Roll it,sweetheart.

38:31.070 --> 38:34.680
Oh! Get her away from me! I think she's got a knife.

38:43.470 --> 38:45.230
Oh,no!

38:45.390 --> 38:46.850
My bunny got wounded.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.070
It's collateral damage. I'm sorry,betty.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.380
Ugh. So what does all of this mean?

38:51.550 --> 38:53.670
Well,essentially, alexis is my boss.

38:53.830 --> 38:55.630
I'm going up to my dad's office right now--

38:55.810 --> 38:58.350
Uh,alexis' office-- To sign the contracts.

38:58.500 --> 39:01.660
Oh,i'm so sorry,daniel, but you know what?

39:01.820 --> 39:04.260
I think i remember your dad calling you "my daniel" once.

39:04.420 --> 39:06.050
It was at the christmas party, and...

39:06.200 --> 39:09.990
It's okay. No,it's just hard to admit he never trusted me.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.960
I guess he knew only alexis had his killer instinct.

39:13.130 --> 39:16.260
Oh,but you don't need a killer instinct to be a leader.

39:16.430 --> 39:19.520
What about martin luther king or jesus?

39:20.930 --> 39:22.030
I mean, you're not as good as them,

39:22.180 --> 39:24.880
But you're at least as good as alexis.

39:25.660 --> 39:27.720
Yeah,i bet i could run a fashion magazine

39:27.890 --> 39:30.060
At least as good as martin luther king.

39:31.690 --> 39:33.500
Probably not jesus.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.060
Willie,disaster.

39:42.220 --> 39:44.060
Jody called me this morning. No one's coming in.

39:44.210 --> 39:46.000
They've mutinied. There's no way to replace them

39:46.150 --> 39:48.810
Unless we hire children or use prison labor.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.940
"Slater's"dead,marc.

39:51.710 --> 39:52.830
Have a cup of tea.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.500
Dead? No.

39:54.670 --> 39:56.470
It's all i've got except for goohair

39:56.620 --> 39:59.880
And good clothes,and actually, you know,i'm doing okay.

40:00.530 --> 40:02.860
But what about you? How can you be so calm?

40:03.020 --> 40:04.580
You've got nothing.

40:07.190 --> 40:11.020
Because i've moved on to plan "b."

40:11.890 --> 40:14.450
I've been saving it foa rainy day.

40:17.050 --> 40:19.730
And by god,it's pouring.

40:24.440 --> 40:26.270
(Gasps) what is that?

40:26.430 --> 40:28.430
Do you remember after bradford died,

40:28.600 --> 40:31.620
I went off to grieve privately?

40:35.710 --> 40:38.210
Tell me,doctor, is it true what i' read,

40:38.370 --> 40:41.320
That sperm can be removed from a body

40:41.480 --> 40:45.960
Up to 48 hours after death and still be viable?

40:46.120 --> 40:48.620
Um,that is correct. Yes.

40:48.770 --> 40:51.270
Well,i wonder if there's a procedure

40:51.430 --> 40:54.350
You'd be willing to do for me.

40:56.890 --> 41:00.450
You mean that's... in your freezer?

41:00.850 --> 41:02.930
I put a pinkberry in there.

41:03.090 --> 41:04.700
It's our future,marc.

41:04.860 --> 41:07.880
If i can't marry into the meade family,

41:08.360 --> 41:11.570
I will give birth to an heir.

41:11.730 --> 41:13.400
