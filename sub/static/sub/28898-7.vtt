00:21.920 --> 00:24.960
What happens in a month,
six months, a year?

00:25.050 --> 00:27.710
When she tells you
she just wants to be friends?

00:28.420 --> 00:30.880
Nate, why would I do
a single thing for you?

00:31.340 --> 00:32.540
'Cause I'll put you in jail.

00:33.210 --> 00:34.850
I need you to get in your car
and drive down

00:34.880 --> 00:36.150
to the East Island
police station.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.850
You're going to walk up
to the receptionist,

00:37.880 --> 00:40.150
and you're gonna tell her you'd
like to confess to a crime.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.210
Do you recognize that man?

00:41.540 --> 00:43.960
He's the guy who assaulted me
the night of the carnival.

00:46.250 --> 00:47.710
Can you please get out of
the pool?

00:47.800 --> 00:50.420
This whole town
is so fucking boring.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.000
I'm a burden, and it is
what it is and it's embarrassing

00:58.090 --> 00:59.210
so I'm sorry.

01:00.590 --> 01:02.630
No funny business, Christopher!

01:07.420 --> 01:08.420
Fuck.

01:24.090 --> 01:26.800
Cassie's dad
was really handsome.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.960
The kind of handsome that made
people treat him differently.

01:37.210 --> 01:40.170
Her mom used to get really
upset at him for flirting.

01:42.210 --> 01:45.050
- Which wasn't fair.
- It wasn't his fault.

01:45.130 --> 01:47.130
He really loved her.

01:48.290 --> 01:50.420
He really loved them all.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.880
Her dad always wanted her to
become a professional ice skater.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.050
Wow. Thank you!

02:02.130 --> 02:04.000
Aw, happy birthday, kiddo.

02:04.090 --> 02:06.750
And for a while,
she thought she might.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.090
She was a natural.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.750
But her dad
couldn't afford lessons,

02:13.840 --> 02:16.920
so he stopped encouraging her.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.920
When she hit puberty,
her mother and her became best friends.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.050
You're an angel.

02:23.710 --> 02:26.170
I feel like a big baby.

02:27.050 --> 02:31.000
Cassie, woman to woman, hmm?

02:31.090 --> 02:32.920
You're perfect.

02:38.670 --> 02:41.710
- Holy moly, look at you.
- What?

02:42.500 --> 02:45.210
You're gonna be
a real heart breaker.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.050
Trust me.

02:47.130 --> 02:49.250
And it wasn't just
her body that changed.

02:49.340 --> 02:50.630
But the rest of the world, too.

02:50.710 --> 02:51.880
You remember Uncle Ted?

02:51.960 --> 02:53.960
Oh, boy, look at you.
All grown up.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.630
Come on, give me a hug.

02:55.710 --> 02:59.880
- You really filled out.
- Sassy Cassie. Come here.

02:59.960 --> 03:03.460
I bet you got all the boys
wrapped around your finger.

03:03.540 --> 03:04.920
Boop.

03:06.710 --> 03:08.460
Their family wasn't perfect.

03:10.630 --> 03:13.630
Her mom had, you know,
some issues.

03:13.710 --> 03:16.420
Oh, my God.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.250
And her dad struggled
to keep a steady income.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.170
- Fuck you.
- This is my family...

03:32.250 --> 03:34.880
And they fought.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.920
In the way all parents
kind of fight.

03:40.710 --> 03:43.920
Except for the night before
she started ninth grade.

03:59.630 --> 04:03.340
Her mom told her that her dad
was just being irrational.

04:03.420 --> 04:06.840
Your father had some serious
jealousy issues.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.840
Let me tell you.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.670
Plus, he couldn't hold a
steady job to save his life.

04:11.750 --> 04:15.750
I just think he didn't want the
responsibility of being a father.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.500
It's too much work.

04:20.589 --> 04:22.880
But Cassie had heard
differently.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.250
My mom said your mom
cheated on your dad.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.290
And that's why he left.

04:27.380 --> 04:29.130
What?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.750
At first, she was really
angry at her mom.

04:38.840 --> 04:42.000
She resented her for being
such a hypocrite.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.840
But then she realized that
her dad wasn't perfect.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.810
I don't know if I want to
be associated with herpes

04:53.840 --> 04:54.960
but, you know...

04:55.050 --> 04:56.540
And her mom wasn't either,

04:56.630 --> 04:59.340
and maybe they just weren't
right for each other.

05:03.710 --> 05:06.540
He used to visit them
on weekends.

05:06.630 --> 05:08.380
Bye, Dad.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.670
- Bye, Dad.
- But, eventually,

05:13.750 --> 05:15.670
it became once
every couple of weeks.

05:17.670 --> 05:19.420
He said he was coming.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.460
And then sometimes,
more than a month would go by.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.130
Then one night...

05:30.210 --> 05:32.540
he was driving home from work...

05:37.380 --> 05:39.880
and was in the ICU for 23 days.

05:41.290 --> 05:44.380
The doctors were afraid
he'd never walk again.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.380
But Cassie knew he was strong,
and that he'd get better.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.920
He was prescribed
fentanyl for pain.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.590
Promethazine to
offset the nausea.

06:00.670 --> 06:02.250
Liquid Lorazepam to sleep,

06:02.340 --> 06:04.880
and Imitrex injections
for migraines.

06:11.710 --> 06:14.840
Cassie would text him
and talk to him.

06:18.250 --> 06:21.590
But as more time went by,
the less responsive he became.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.500
And eventually, months went by,

06:24.590 --> 06:27.380
and she didn't
hear from him at all.

06:27.460 --> 06:30.590
Until one night, a week
after her 15th birthday,

06:30.670 --> 06:34.750
she got a text from a random number
at about 1:00 in the morning.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.750
And even though
she was excited to see him

06:52.840 --> 06:54.340
and wanted to hug him,

06:54.420 --> 06:57.500
there was something about the
whole thing that scared her.

06:57.590 --> 06:59.420
I want you to know
there's never a day goes by

06:59.500 --> 07:01.130
I don't think about you.

07:02.340 --> 07:05.090
The number you texted me from.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.800
Can I call you?

07:10.250 --> 07:12.500
That's my friend's phone.

07:12.590 --> 07:16.000
But I promise I'll reach you
to you with my new number, I...

07:17.800 --> 07:20.290
Don't cry, baby.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.960
I'm okay. I'm fine. Don't...

07:26.170 --> 07:29.130
I just miss you, Dad.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.800
I miss you, okay. I love you.

07:39.630 --> 07:41.540
He said he needed a few things,

07:41.630 --> 07:44.630
and made her promise
that she wouldn't tell a soul.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.210
Cassie kept her promise,

08:09.290 --> 08:12.130
and never told anyone
about that night.

08:12.210 --> 08:16.380
She also never
saw her dad again.

08:16.460 --> 08:19.460
She fell in love with
every guy she ever dated.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.540
Whether they were
smart or stupid

08:22.630 --> 08:25.050
or sweet or cruel,
it didn't matter.

08:41.380 --> 08:43.590
She didn't like to be alone.

08:44.340 --> 08:47.920
- What are you doing?
- Ex-boyfriend 1: I'm just filming you.

08:48.540 --> 08:49.960
Why?

08:50.050 --> 08:53.460
And every guy she ever dated
asked for the same things.

08:53.540 --> 08:56.880
- Can I film you sucking my dick?
- What? No!

08:56.960 --> 08:59.750
- What? Stop.
- Ex-boyfriend 3: Let's make a sex tape.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.380
What? Get out of here. Come on.
I won't tell anyone.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.180
- It's not that big of a deal.
- Yes, it is.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.340
I don't wanna do this.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.250
And she almost always said yes.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.590
Even though it didn't always
make her feel good.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.670
And she knew that most guys,
after she broke up with them,

09:16.750 --> 09:18.840
would always share
those photos or videos.

09:20.420 --> 09:23.290
The first time she found out,
she had a panic attack,

09:23.380 --> 09:26.250
and wanted to swallow
a whole bottle of Tylenol.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.630
But she didn't. Because, I mean,

09:29.710 --> 09:31.480
what's the worst thing
anybody could say to her?

09:31.500 --> 09:34.170
That she gave a blowjob
to a guy who didn't deserve it?

09:34.250 --> 09:36.460
And she figured by the time
she was out of college

09:36.540 --> 09:38.540
and looking for a job,
99 percent of the population

09:38.590 --> 09:40.920
would have leaked nudes, anyway.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.630
And then, at the beginning
of the year, she met McKay.

09:46.710 --> 09:48.750
And fell in love with him.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.840
And he fell in love with her.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.500
I love you. And even though
things weren't perfect,

09:53.590 --> 09:55.880
he loved her for who she was.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.920
And even though she had
made a couple of mistakes,

09:57.960 --> 09:59.380
I mean, they weren't big ones.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.880
They weren't the kind of things
you couldn't come back from.

10:39.670 --> 10:42.880
Previously on Love Island...

10:42.960 --> 10:46.050
G rab the amazing-ness
that you have with Josh

10:46.130 --> 10:47.590
by the balls.

10:47.670 --> 10:51.050
People are always telling me
about great TV shows.

10:51.130 --> 10:53.420
How I just have to watch
this show.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.050
But the truth is,
I don't want good TV.

10:57.130 --> 10:59.090
I don't want a novel,
or some slow burn,

10:59.170 --> 11:01.090
or anything that
feels like work.

11:01.170 --> 11:02.840
That's why I love reality TV.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.630
It's funny, it's dramatic,
and I can focus on it.

11:06.710 --> 11:09.590
It's pure, effortless
entertainment.

11:10.880 --> 11:14.130
Romance hits the rocks.

11:14.210 --> 11:16.290
She doesn't talk to me,
she doesn't acknowledge me.

11:16.380 --> 11:18.340
- She's playing a game.
- -Woman: Honestly...

11:18.420 --> 11:19.630
I want to lay down one moment

11:19.710 --> 11:21.290
and then look around the next

11:21.380 --> 11:22.750
and realize I have watched

11:22.840 --> 11:24.500
22 straight hours of Love Island

11:24.590 --> 11:26.130
over a two-day period...

11:26.210 --> 11:29.800
and yearn for more.-

11:29.880 --> 11:32.960
Some people may
find that depressing.

11:33.050 --> 11:34.880
I don't.

11:37.710 --> 11:40.670
It is, however, a good way
to measure depression.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.460
Because when reality TV
begins to feel like work,

11:43.540 --> 11:46.250
like, final season
of Mad Men work,

11:46.340 --> 11:48.750
you know you're depressed.

11:48.840 --> 11:53.630
Like, haven't got out of bed
to pee in 24 hours depressed.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.380
Do I look different to you?

12:05.210 --> 12:06.840
You look fine to me.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.000
'Cause I feel different.

12:09.090 --> 12:11.050
Okay, well, you don't look it.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.130
I don't think I'm gonna
go to school today.

12:14.210 --> 12:18.420
- 'Cause of Daniel?
- No, not 'cause of Daniel, Lexi!

12:18.500 --> 12:20.750
Daniel's the last fucking thing
I care about right now.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.650
Okay, well,
it's all you ever fucking talk about.

12:22.670 --> 12:26.380
That's not true! I asked you how I look.
Not about Daniel!

12:26.460 --> 12:28.210
Yeah, well,
you look beautiful, Cassie.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.500
You look fucking amazing.

12:29.590 --> 12:31.290
It's literally all
anyone's ever told you

12:31.380 --> 12:32.540
your entire life.

12:32.630 --> 12:35.800
Like, listen to yourself.
It's fucking exhausting.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.210
The thought of having
to stand up,

13:05.290 --> 13:09.800
exert 172 muscles
each step for 35 feet,

13:09.880 --> 13:12.750
just so I can sit on cold
porcelain and piss out toxins

13:12.840 --> 13:15.540
over and over again
for the rest of my life

13:15.630 --> 13:17.670
makes the whole concept
of living

13:17.750 --> 13:20.960
feel like one long,
sadistic joke.

13:22.670 --> 13:26.130
But the absolute worst part
of depression

13:26.210 --> 13:28.420
is that even though
you know you're depressed,

13:28.500 --> 13:31.840
you're unable to stop yourself
from getting worse.

13:33.670 --> 13:36.840
But I wasn't the only one
feeling down.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.000
Jules? What's wrong?

13:42.090 --> 13:46.500
- I'm sick.
- Okay. Let me know if you need anything.

13:48.210 --> 13:49.750
After Halloween,

13:49.840 --> 13:52.340
Jules didn't go to school
for a full week.

13:55.750 --> 13:59.590
And even though I sent her about 50
texts, she didn't respond.

14:00.050 --> 14:01.800
Happy Halloween.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.540
I could tell something bad
had happened.

14:04.630 --> 14:07.210
And that it had
something to do with Nate.

14:15.340 --> 14:18.750
Tyler Clarkson
was booked for assault.

14:21.050 --> 14:25.380
But this shit wasn't adding up.

14:25.460 --> 14:28.170
And I was putting together
the pieces of the puzzle.

14:28.250 --> 14:31.500
Howard, let's roll.

14:31.590 --> 14:34.710
I wasn't gonna stop
until I got the truth.

14:36.630 --> 14:38.960
False accusations
in today's world

14:39.050 --> 14:40.800
can cause serious
long-term damage

14:40.880 --> 14:44.420
to one's career, reputation,
and emotional well-being.

14:47.090 --> 14:49.840
We all owe Nate Jacobs
a heartfelt apology,

14:49.920 --> 14:51.210
and are excited and thrilled

14:51.290 --> 14:54.090
to have him back
at East Highland.

14:54.170 --> 14:56.250
Why would Jules lie
to help Nate?

14:56.340 --> 14:57.500
I don't know.

14:57.590 --> 15:00.380
- Well, have you asked her about it?
- No.

15:00.460 --> 15:02.460
- You haven't asked her?
- No.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.420
Keep looking, you mook.

15:04.500 --> 15:08.500
I'm Morgan fuckin' Freeman and this
is the beginning of the third act.

15:08.590 --> 15:11.420
Well, doesn't that seem like
the first logical step?

15:13.050 --> 15:16.340
Honestly, Howard,
this whole thing is beyond logic.

15:16.420 --> 15:19.170
Unless...

15:21.840 --> 15:23.290
Jules is in love with Nate.

15:23.710 --> 15:26.670
Why would Jules be in love with Nate?
You should listen to me.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.980
- Bennett, the cigarettes are killing me.
- Hear me out. Listen. Listen.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.940
Listen, the night of the
carnival, she said she wanted

15:30.960 --> 15:32.850
to go meet up with this guy
she met online, okay?

15:32.880 --> 15:35.420
He's some fuckin' jock,
he's from a conservative family,

15:35.500 --> 15:37.590
and they were talking
and texting.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.290
They've been texting for weeks.

15:39.380 --> 15:42.710
And when I say texting,
I don't just mean regular fuckin' texting.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.750
They were sexting.

15:45.840 --> 15:49.670
- Like nudes?
- Yeah. Side note,

15:49.750 --> 15:51.800
very nice dick. Very clean room.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.210
Oh.

15:53.290 --> 15:55.130
She never fucking say his face.

15:55.210 --> 15:57.380
Yeah, so Jules is catfished.

15:57.460 --> 15:59.190
Now hear me out.
So the night of the carnival,

15:59.210 --> 16:00.340
she made plans with this guy

16:00.420 --> 16:01.810
to meet up with him
at the lake, okay?

16:01.840 --> 16:03.420
I fucking go home.
Next thing I know...

16:03.500 --> 16:05.460
she's fucking
knocking at my window.

16:05.540 --> 16:06.880
She's all emotional,

16:06.960 --> 16:08.360
she's got fucking tears
in her eyes.

16:08.420 --> 16:11.170
I say, Jules,
what the fuck happened?

16:11.250 --> 16:13.380
She looks at me. She goes...

16:14.130 --> 16:16.420
"He didn't look like
his pictures."

16:17.000 --> 16:19.460
Yeah, that's like,
the definition of catfishing.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.960
No, but do you know
what his name was?

16:22.750 --> 16:25.500
- Nate Jacobs?
- Tyler.

16:27.670 --> 16:30.290
Like, Tyler Clarkson?

16:31.800 --> 16:34.090
You're goddamned right.

16:34.670 --> 16:38.420
Maddy is 17, Tyler's 22,
and they fornicated.

16:38.500 --> 16:42.540
- Statutory.
- Yeah. You saw it, I saw it. We all fucking saw it.

16:42.630 --> 16:46.250
- Including Nate.
- And what is a lighter offense than statutory?

16:46.340 --> 16:47.880
Assault.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.880
Bingo!

16:53.050 --> 16:55.540
Rue, are you pouring coffee
in the water filter?

16:55.630 --> 16:57.420
- Yes, I am.
- Instead of water?

16:57.500 --> 16:59.100
- Yes, I am.
- Well, please, don't do that.

16:59.130 --> 17:01.880
And it's late.
You shouldn't be drinking caffeine.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.460
Mom, please. I have homework.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.170
Well, there's a sentence
I never thought I'd hear.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.000
Will you let me know
when this is ready?

17:13.460 --> 17:15.589
Hello?

17:15.670 --> 17:17.250
Howard, it's Bennett.

17:17.339 --> 17:19.670
- It's 2:45 in the morning.
- Don't you ever sleep?

17:19.750 --> 17:23.380
Listen, why would Nate single
out Jules in the first place?

17:23.460 --> 17:26.210
It's obvious he was
sexually attracted to her.

17:28.210 --> 17:31.210
And because Jules
is predominantly het, okay,

17:31.290 --> 17:34.670
he wooed her with his, uh,
fucking creepy jock magic shit.

17:34.750 --> 17:37.170
She's super fuckin' sensitive,
she's very forgiving,

17:37.250 --> 17:41.000
and she's basically the most wonderful
fucking person on the planet...

17:41.090 --> 17:42.920
she fell for him.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.090
That's why she
fucking testified.

17:45.170 --> 17:48.170
I'm a genius.
I'm a fucking genius.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.960
Hey, Mom! I'm a fucking genius.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.800
I'm not even tired. It's crazy.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.420
I'm not even fucking tired.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.840
I feel amazing.

17:56.920 --> 17:59.340
I'll be honest with you,
Bennett.

17:59.420 --> 18:01.130
You're too close to this case.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.750
- Who was that?
- Rue.

18:16.670 --> 18:21.130
Think she's in, like, a manic state.
Is she okay?

18:22.380 --> 18:24.340
I don't think so.

18:37.710 --> 18:40.130
Fuck.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.920
I don't know what you're gonna
say, but this feels like...

18:53.000 --> 18:55.210
really dramatic.

18:55.290 --> 18:57.540
Yeah, this is spooky.

18:57.630 --> 19:00.000
It is not spooky, BB.

19:00.670 --> 19:04.590
I just, I need your advice
on, like, two things.

19:04.670 --> 19:08.380
And I need you guys to promise me
not to say a single fucking word.

19:11.840 --> 19:15.750
So, the night of Daniel's
Halloween party,

19:15.840 --> 19:18.170
something happened.

19:28.540 --> 19:31.420
I don't usually come that fast.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.380
That was amazing.

19:37.090 --> 19:40.170
It's funny. I always thought I was
gonna lose my virginity to you.

19:44.050 --> 19:48.090
- You're a virgin?
- No, I mean, when we were younger.

19:48.170 --> 19:51.880
- When we dated.
- We dated?

19:53.880 --> 19:55.840
Yeah, in sixth grade.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.090
You and me?

19:59.880 --> 20:02.880
Yeah, for like five months.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.920
Oh.

20:06.500 --> 20:10.250
I literally have
no recollection of that.

20:14.590 --> 20:16.800
Wait. Am I hearing this
correctly?

20:16.880 --> 20:19.050
You want to tell McKay
that you made out with Daniel

20:19.130 --> 20:20.920
at the carnival
and on Halloween?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.100
Yeah, but, I don't... I don't
have to say it's Daniel.

20:23.130 --> 20:25.840
Bitch, that's the craziest idea
I've ever heard. Right?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.170
For sure.

20:27.250 --> 20:30.800
Yeah, but I want to be
honest with him.

20:31.750 --> 20:35.250
- You cannot tell McKay.
- But it's not like I cheated-cheated.

20:35.340 --> 20:38.340
Kissing is worse.
It's so much more intimate.

20:38.420 --> 20:41.590
And if anybody brings it up,
you deny, deny, deny.

20:41.670 --> 20:43.430
Okay, but, I just...
I don't want there to be

20:43.500 --> 20:44.980
something this bad
between us forever.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.730
I wouldn't worry about it, Cassie.
It's not like

20:46.750 --> 20:48.670
you guys are gonna be
together forever.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.800
Kat, what the fuck
is your problem?

20:50.880 --> 20:53.420
You're being a bad friend now.
You were a bad friend to me,

20:53.500 --> 20:56.540
and this whole new personality
is seriously unlikable.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.050
World Star!

20:58.130 --> 20:59.770
Why, because I won't sit and
listen to you bitch and moan

20:59.800 --> 21:01.710
about your psychotic,
abusive boyfriend

21:01.800 --> 21:04.000
who you've literally broken
up with a thousand times?

21:04.090 --> 21:07.090
It was literally the lowest
point in my life, so, yeah.

21:07.170 --> 21:09.290
That and the fact that
you're just fuckin' mean.

21:09.380 --> 21:11.850
Maddy, ever since I've met you,
all you talk about is yourself.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.170
Your clothes, your boyfriends,
whatever superficial shit

21:14.250 --> 21:15.880
you think is so
fucking important.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.540
Sorry I'm no longer interested.

21:17.630 --> 21:20.500
I don't know about everyone
else, but I miss the old Kat.

21:20.590 --> 21:22.340
You know, the one
who had a sense of humor

21:22.420 --> 21:24.340
and wasn't a fuckin' cunt?

21:24.420 --> 21:26.130
Damn.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.250
What was the other thing?

22:02.340 --> 22:04.250
What other thing?

22:04.340 --> 22:07.340
You said you needed advice
on two things.

22:09.090 --> 22:10.800
I don't remember.

22:12.090 --> 22:13.840
What would you do?

22:15.170 --> 22:17.290
Um, I don't know.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.210
I've never really
been in a situation

22:19.290 --> 22:21.590
where two guys
have been interested in me.

22:21.670 --> 22:23.880
That's 'cause you're shy.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.130
I guess so, but I've also
never been in a situation

22:28.210 --> 22:30.130
where I've been interested
in two guys.

22:30.210 --> 22:32.340
That's also 'cause you're shy.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.670
Maybe.

22:35.290 --> 22:38.210
But if you were in my situation,
what would you do?

22:40.540 --> 22:43.540
Honestly, I don't think
I would say anything.

22:46.750 --> 22:50.170
What if not saying something
makes you feel really bad?

22:51.540 --> 22:53.540
Worse than saying it?

22:54.800 --> 22:56.170
Yeah.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.750
Well, then, I don't think
you have any other option.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.540
How are you feeling?

23:19.920 --> 23:22.840
Uh, I think I have the flu
or something.

23:23.250 --> 23:25.000
You want me to
get you something?

23:25.090 --> 23:28.630
- Something to drink, or something...
- Uh, no, I'm good.

23:34.170 --> 23:36.630
You sure you got the flu, Rue?

23:38.380 --> 23:39.580
Gia, right now I just need you

23:39.630 --> 23:41.290
to leave me
the fuck alone, all right?

23:52.540 --> 23:55.960
Narrator: Previously...

24:04.170 --> 24:07.500
Look, Nate, we all make
mistakes in life.

24:08.420 --> 24:09.960
We hurt the ones we love.

24:10.050 --> 24:12.290
We let down our friends,
our family.

24:13.380 --> 24:15.000
Sometimes we do it
out of ignorance.

24:15.090 --> 24:17.250
Sometimes it's selfishness.

24:19.710 --> 24:22.000
I am not perfect.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.340
You know that.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.590
But I've spent my life
trying to do better.

24:27.670 --> 24:29.670
You have not.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.050
But it is my wish for you.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.050
I don't know how you got
out of this situation.

24:37.500 --> 24:41.380
I know you didn't deserve
to, but you did.

24:41.460 --> 24:43.960
And I admire whatever it took.

24:44.710 --> 24:47.710
I just hope it didn't teach you
the wrong lesson.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.460
Okay, this is gonna sound sick,

25:11.540 --> 25:13.670
because I'm actually
in a lot of pain right now,

25:13.750 --> 25:16.960
due to the sheer weight
and strain on my bladder,

25:17.050 --> 25:20.210
but, man, does this
make me miss opiates.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.340
Because your bladder is trained
from a very early age

25:25.420 --> 25:27.170
not to pee whenever it wants to,

25:27.250 --> 25:28.960
it needs permission
from your brain.

25:29.050 --> 25:30.290
And when you're really high,

25:30.380 --> 25:33.380
your brain gets a little...
lazy.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.840
Too lazy to say something.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.460
Come on. Breathe.

25:38.540 --> 25:40.380
Come on, please.

25:40.460 --> 25:43.750
It's probably why so many
drug addicts die on toilets.

25:49.290 --> 25:52.460
The truth is,
the last time I left this room,

25:52.540 --> 25:54.800
I didn't have
the best experience.

26:17.090 --> 26:19.000
Sleeping all day?

26:19.800 --> 26:22.540
It's quite the life.

26:22.630 --> 26:26.540
Meet Rick.
My mom's new boyfriend.

26:26.630 --> 26:29.210
If you were to ask Rick
to describe himself,

26:29.290 --> 26:31.000
he'd say he was...

26:31.090 --> 26:32.500
"A romantic at heart.

26:32.590 --> 26:35.340
"I'm adventurous.
I love to travel.

26:35.420 --> 26:37.540
"I love the outdoors...

26:37.630 --> 26:42.800
great art, great movies,
great wine. Forever young."

26:50.000 --> 26:52.540
Sorry, I'm sorry.

26:52.630 --> 26:54.050
Oh.

26:54.130 --> 26:57.500
- I miss your dad.
- Me, too.

26:57.590 --> 27:00.210
So, enter Rick.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.460
So...

27:04.250 --> 27:07.750
Your mom tells me
that you have a new, uh,

27:07.840 --> 27:09.540
"best friend."

27:11.170 --> 27:13.340
What is that supposed to mean?

27:13.880 --> 27:15.540
That, you know.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.630
You got a new best friend.

27:23.090 --> 27:24.880
You know what, Rick?

27:26.340 --> 27:28.590
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

27:28.670 --> 27:30.630
How dare you speak
to someone like that?

27:30.710 --> 27:32.250
- Like that?
- Who? Rick.

27:32.340 --> 27:34.210
- Don't be a smart-ass.
- Did I offend you?

27:34.290 --> 27:35.920
Apologize right now.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.170
In retrospect,
I was a little cunt-y.

27:38.250 --> 27:41.590
But Rick does suck,
and I was angry.

27:41.670 --> 27:43.380
For a lot of reasons.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.380
Rick, I sincerely apologize

27:45.460 --> 27:47.710
for telling you
to go fuck yourself.

27:49.590 --> 27:51.960
What I really meant to say
is that my mom can do better

27:52.050 --> 27:54.710
and I hate seeing you sit
in the chair my dad sat at.

28:41.590 --> 28:43.540
If I am bipolar...

28:45.090 --> 28:48.460
I sure as shit prefer mania
over depression.

28:50.500 --> 28:53.460
Yo, Fez. So you know how
in every '90s thriller, right,

28:53.540 --> 28:56.880
Morgan Freeman plays, like,
the same semi-psychic black cop.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.290
- Yeah.
- So, I know that's kind of racist,

28:59.380 --> 29:01.050
but the point is,
in every movie,

29:01.130 --> 29:04.460
he's always calmly putting the
fucking pieces of the case together,

29:04.540 --> 29:06.520
while everybody else around him
is fucking freaking out,

29:06.540 --> 29:08.850
saying, "You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about, Morgan."

29:08.880 --> 29:10.500
"You're... You're a fucking
bad husband.

29:10.590 --> 29:11.880
You should fucking retire."

29:11.960 --> 29:16.170
But no. Morgan is fucking
hyper-focused.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.670
Because he can see beyond
the little details.

29:18.750 --> 29:20.960
He's looking for
the big fuckin' picture.

29:21.050 --> 29:24.050
Because all of this shit?
It's connected, Fez.

29:24.590 --> 29:28.710
And it is way bigger than any
of us can even fucking see.

29:31.460 --> 29:33.210
The point is, that's me.

29:33.290 --> 29:36.460
Right now, that is fucking me.

29:36.540 --> 29:39.960
I can see everything
so fucking clearly.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.540
I know what happened,
I know why it happened,

29:42.630 --> 29:45.500
and I know what the fuck
I'm gonna do about it.

29:47.170 --> 29:48.460
Word.

29:48.540 --> 29:49.920
Word.

29:50.750 --> 29:54.250
- She can't hear me, right?
- She can't see you, either.

29:54.340 --> 29:57.500
Okay, good, 'cause this is,
like, some real top-secret shit.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.840
Trust me, Rue,
she not gonna gossip.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.500
Okay.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.500
- Do you still have that gun?
- What gun?

30:09.210 --> 30:11.170
The one from the couch.

30:12.420 --> 30:15.500
I mean, I got a couple guns.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.630
Why do you have so many guns?

30:17.710 --> 30:19.460
My grandma.

30:22.340 --> 30:23.590
That's cool.

30:23.670 --> 30:26.130
What you worried
about my guns for?

30:28.500 --> 30:31.750
Okay, well, I was thinking...

30:31.840 --> 30:37.000
that maybe you could use one
to scare Nate Jacobs.

30:39.290 --> 30:41.250
Are you serious?

30:41.340 --> 30:44.460
I mean, I'm not not serious.

30:44.750 --> 30:46.540
Rue, that must be
the dumbest shit

30:46.630 --> 30:48.210
you've said all fucking day.

30:48.290 --> 30:51.130
You don't have to fucking point it at him.
You could just...

30:51.210 --> 30:54.540
You could, like...
You could flash it.

30:54.630 --> 30:57.630
You really have lost
your fuckin' mind, Rue.

30:57.710 --> 30:59.800
Fuck, it's a bad fucking idea,
okay?

30:59.880 --> 31:02.710
I just was fucking
spit balling, here.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.380
I mean, he fucked with me,
he fucked with Jules.

31:06.460 --> 31:08.800
And I want fucking revenge.
Okay?

31:08.880 --> 31:10.670
Sorry.

31:14.710 --> 31:16.800
Fuck. Mouse is here.

31:16.880 --> 31:20.880
- The guy with the...
- All right, so, stay in here. Be quiet...

31:20.960 --> 31:23.060
Fez, I can't... I can't stay in here.
Like, I'm really...

31:23.090 --> 31:25.100
- Yes, the fuck you can. Shh!
- I'm not good with awkward silences.

31:25.130 --> 31:27.670
Be quiet. Listen,
I'm really serious right now.

31:27.750 --> 31:30.090
You just need to
sit your manic ass down,

31:30.170 --> 31:32.670
and be quiet for five
fuckin' minutes, Rue.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.420
I'm not fuckin'
playin' with you.

31:34.500 --> 31:38.250
Sit down and shut the fuck up.

31:53.750 --> 31:55.750
Okay.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.960
So fuckin' weird.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.630
Psst.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.170
Psst.

32:17.630 --> 32:18.630
Psst.

32:19.710 --> 32:21.170
Yo, Rue.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.630
Rue.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.460
Rue, I'm so lonely.

32:26.540 --> 32:29.090
Me, too. Don't forget about me.

32:29.170 --> 32:32.880
That old lady?
She doesn't even know we exist.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.090
All; Rue!

32:35.170 --> 32:38.210
Eat us all.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.210
- Eat...
- Us...

32:39.290 --> 32:40.170
- All!
- Eat...

32:40.250 --> 32:41.250
- Us...
- All!

32:41.290 --> 32:43.750
Eat us all! Eat us all!

32:49.170 --> 32:52.000
Yo, I'm gonna need you
to start moving some weight.

32:53.500 --> 32:56.750
Yo, I'm just trying to keep it
low-key over here, man.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.630
And I'm trying to make
fuckin' money.

32:58.710 --> 33:01.130
Even if wanted
all this shit, bruh,

33:01.210 --> 33:03.250
I don't got the money
for all this, man.

33:03.340 --> 33:06.130
That's why you in luck.
I'm gonna front it to you.

33:06.210 --> 33:09.380
Ten percent on the vig,
and I'll collect in a month.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.590
I'm not tryin' to do
all that shit, man.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.340
I ain't asking, bruh.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.960
Step yo shit up.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.540
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

33:26.630 --> 33:30.000
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

33:30.090 --> 33:31.380
One...

34:07.210 --> 34:08.800
The other thing about depression

34:08.880 --> 34:11.000
is it kind of collapses time.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.880
Rue, are you listening?

34:15.090 --> 34:18.250
Suddenly, you find your
whole days blending together

34:18.340 --> 34:21.710
to create one endless
and suffocating loop.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.380
So you find yourself
trying to remember

34:32.460 --> 34:34.880
the things that made you happy.

34:39.290 --> 34:41.750
Do you want to get closer? Yeah.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.290
But slowly, your brain
begins to erase

34:44.380 --> 34:47.250
every memory that
ever brought you joy.

34:53.090 --> 34:55.090
And eventually,

34:55.170 --> 34:58.960
all you can think about is how
life has always been this way.

35:02.960 --> 35:06.000
And will only continue
to be this way.

35:10.210 --> 35:14.800
Narrator:
Previously, on Love Island...

35:14.880 --> 35:16.920
Grab the amazing-ness

35:17.000 --> 35:18.880
that you have with Josh
by the balls.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.920
I wonder if Jules is having fun.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.960
Stay clear of the tracks...

35:52.710 --> 35:55.000
Oh, I missed you!

35:55.880 --> 35:57.880
So how are the suburbs
treating you?

35:57.960 --> 35:59.800
They're claustrophobic.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.540
Yeah, how do you like it?
How you doing?

36:02.630 --> 36:06.840
I don't know.
It's been a weird, weird-ass year.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.630
Weird in what way?

36:09.710 --> 36:11.920
Weird in every way.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.090
Shit. You make some
good friends, at least?

36:15.170 --> 36:17.460
- Yeah, I got one.
- Yeah?

36:17.540 --> 36:20.130
But it's, like, complicated.

36:20.210 --> 36:21.670
Oh.

36:21.750 --> 36:24.630
Well, are you friends,
or are you a little bit more,

36:24.710 --> 36:26.960
- like a special kind of friend?
- Both, I guess?

36:27.050 --> 36:28.540
- Aah.
- Yeah.

36:28.630 --> 36:31.170
Okay. What, are you in
love with him or something?

36:31.250 --> 36:34.170
- Her, not him.
- Oh!

36:34.250 --> 36:35.920
- Ooh, a little plot twist. Okay!
- Yeah.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.670
- No room for hetero-normativity in here.
- My bad.

36:39.540 --> 36:41.710
So... what?

36:41.800 --> 36:44.960
- I don't know. I don't know what it is.
- Yeah.

36:45.050 --> 36:47.670
It's not, like, great right now.

36:51.250 --> 36:54.750
I'm not exactly, like,
in the best place.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.920
Why? What's going on?

37:01.920 --> 37:04.880
I came here so I wouldn't
have to think about it.

37:07.540 --> 37:09.090
Understood.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.290
Oh!

37:45.630 --> 37:48.500
- This one?
- No, I'm one more up.

38:01.460 --> 38:03.250
Yo, Anna.

38:05.130 --> 38:06.590
- Hey.
- Anna,

38:06.670 --> 38:08.920
someone I want you to meet.

38:09.540 --> 38:12.170
Hi. I'm Jules.

38:13.460 --> 38:15.170
I know.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.340
- Like it?
- Did y'all make these?

38:18.420 --> 38:22.590
Our friend did.
I mean, are you guys gonna go out?

38:23.090 --> 38:25.630
Uh, Anna's always trying
to put makeup on me.

38:25.710 --> 38:27.590
So awkward.

38:34.170 --> 38:36.840
I remember walking out of Sears

38:36.920 --> 38:40.250
with my first pair of
heels in my backpack. Cute.

38:40.340 --> 38:44.420
And my heart was fucking racing.

38:44.500 --> 38:47.590
And I got home,
and went straight to my room,

38:47.670 --> 38:50.290
locked the door, put 'em on...

38:50.380 --> 38:53.380
And, I just...

38:53.460 --> 38:55.050
felt like...

38:55.130 --> 38:57.250
I was collecting...

38:57.340 --> 39:03.380
herbs, or making potions in
order to up my manna, you know?

39:04.840 --> 39:06.170
Like, it started with that,

39:06.250 --> 39:08.630
and then it was clothes,
and then it was...

39:08.710 --> 39:12.630
makeup, and eventually hormones.

39:12.710 --> 39:16.920
Um, I just kind of kept
leveling up.

39:18.130 --> 39:21.460
So, what level are you at now?

39:21.540 --> 39:23.590
I don't know.

39:23.670 --> 39:28.920
But I definitely haven't
reached my full power.

39:31.590 --> 39:34.130
But you date guys, right?

39:34.210 --> 39:36.800
Date isn't really
the right word.

39:36.880 --> 39:39.130
What she means to say
is that she's a slut.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.500
- Fuck you!
- What, it's not an insult!

39:42.590 --> 39:45.800
- I mean...
- But you normally hook up with guys.

39:47.250 --> 39:48.880
Yeah, but...

39:48.960 --> 39:52.000
my relationship to men is weird.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.590
- Like, how?
- In my head, it's like...

39:58.210 --> 40:00.540
If I can conquer men,

40:00.630 --> 40:03.750
then I can conquer femininity.

40:05.750 --> 40:08.630
Why do you need a guy
to make you feel more feminine?

40:11.920 --> 40:13.250
Hmm?

40:15.090 --> 40:17.920
We'll circle back to that one.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.170
- So have you?
- Have I what?

40:24.250 --> 40:26.340
Conquered femininity?

40:27.840 --> 40:29.630
I don't know.

40:30.090 --> 40:32.880
But, it's not like I even
want to conquer it.

40:32.960 --> 40:35.710
It's like I want to fuckin'
obliterate it.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.710
And then move on to the next level.
Mmm.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.590
And the next, and the next.

40:42.670 --> 40:45.710
Level up. Level up!

40:45.800 --> 40:49.840
Yeah. I don't really know what the
means, or looks like, but...

40:51.130 --> 40:53.670
- I want it.
- Queerness is infinite.

40:55.630 --> 40:58.130
Okay, look at me.

40:59.630 --> 41:02.500
Yeah. You look adorable.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.840
Stop.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.880
I'm pregnant.

41:15.420 --> 41:16.710
What?

41:18.500 --> 41:21.290
Are you for real that
you're 100 percent pregnant?

41:23.590 --> 41:24.630
Yeah.

41:33.210 --> 41:35.130
I...

41:37.000 --> 41:38.880
I'm sorry, uh...

41:40.290 --> 41:42.170
Are you all right?

41:44.920 --> 41:48.050
Yeah, I'm... I'm just
a little bit nervous.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.670
Nervous about what?

41:53.590 --> 41:55.380
About what you're gonna say.

42:01.460 --> 42:04.340
You're not really thinking
about having this kid, are you?

42:08.380 --> 42:10.710
I really love you, McKay.

42:11.210 --> 42:12.290
Yeah, I love you, too,

42:12.380 --> 42:14.380
but I'm doing a lot
of shit right now.

42:15.710 --> 42:18.290
I'm in the middle
of school right now.

42:18.380 --> 42:20.880
It's a big fuckin'
responsibility, Cassie.

42:23.290 --> 42:26.210
What if this is what I'm
supposed to do with my life?

42:31.290 --> 42:32.800
What the fuck?

42:33.540 --> 42:35.710
My parents are gonna kill me.

42:35.800 --> 42:36.920
My coach is gonna kill me.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.170
My parents are gonna
fucking kill me.

42:39.250 --> 42:40.800
Fuck.

42:43.340 --> 42:46.340
Cass, I don't even think
you wanna have this baby, okay?

42:46.420 --> 42:48.750
It's not a... It's not a
fuckin' fairy tale. Like...

42:48.840 --> 42:52.380
It may seem all cute and cuddly to
you, but this is real shit.

42:53.090 --> 42:54.800
I'm not even ready to be a dad.

42:54.880 --> 42:57.960
I don't know if that's selfish
to say or whatever, but...

42:58.050 --> 43:00.250
Children are fuckin' scary.

43:02.920 --> 43:05.350
You wanted to talk about it,
so here we are, we're talking about it.

43:05.380 --> 43:07.130
But I say we don't do it.

43:09.090 --> 43:12.630
I'm not saying
I'm gonna have a baby.

43:16.840 --> 43:20.090
I just wanted to dream
about it for a minute.

43:45.130 --> 43:48.500
You'll make the best mother
on the planet one day.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.670
I say that without a doubt.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.840
Hello?-

44:06.500 --> 44:09.500
For some reason your screen is black.
Should I call you back?

44:09.590 --> 44:12.340
No, I prefer to
keep it that way.

44:12.420 --> 44:14.590
Oh. Okay.

44:14.670 --> 44:19.000
- You drive a hard bargain.
- Yeah, well, a girl's got to eat.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.920
300 for thirty minutes.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.420
- You should have asked for more.
- Really?

44:25.500 --> 44:29.880
- Let me see your whole body.
- Stand up.

44:36.880 --> 44:39.840
Yes.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.710
Keep going.

44:42.750 --> 44:44.250
Yes.

44:45.710 --> 44:47.750
Fantastic.

44:59.250 --> 45:01.250
Are you nervous?

45:01.340 --> 45:04.840
- I-I-I...
- I mean, I don't usually, um...

45:04.920 --> 45:06.590
undress.

45:06.670 --> 45:10.880
But I am special. Right?

45:13.340 --> 45:14.880
Yes.

45:16.050 --> 45:18.250
Then say it.

45:19.920 --> 45:22.000
You're special.

45:22.090 --> 45:25.750
So, get undressed.

45:42.920 --> 45:46.090
Oh, wow.

45:53.250 --> 45:56.420
You're beautiful.

46:15.130 --> 46:18.090
Can you get me a mango La Croix?
Um-hmm.

46:18.170 --> 46:21.500
- And those cherry rolling papers?
- Anything else?

46:32.050 --> 46:34.670
- What up, Fez?
- What's up, man?

46:34.750 --> 46:38.380
Yo, can I get, uh,
two of the rolling papers, too, bruh?

46:40.050 --> 46:41.750
Yo, man.

46:41.840 --> 46:45.750
I don't know what's been going on with
you, Rue, and Jules and shit.

46:46.460 --> 46:50.540
But you should know,
I really do care about her.

46:55.090 --> 46:57.340
Aren't you, like,
her drug dealer?

46:58.130 --> 46:59.710
Nah, man.

47:01.250 --> 47:03.500
What, are you in a relationship?

47:04.590 --> 47:06.960
Nah, bruh, that's like,
my family.

47:07.050 --> 47:09.250
So it's platonic.

47:09.340 --> 47:11.000
Look, man,

47:11.090 --> 47:14.710
all I'm saying is,
leave her and her friends alone.

47:16.290 --> 47:17.750
Is that a threat?

47:19.800 --> 47:22.250
Nah, I'm just telling you.

47:22.630 --> 47:24.210
Or what?

47:25.170 --> 47:28.050
We're not gonna be
having this conversation.

47:37.840 --> 47:39.880
Fezco, let's get this straight.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.670
You're, like, half a retard.

47:42.750 --> 47:45.210
You dropped out of school
at 20, and now...

47:45.290 --> 47:47.460
you're a gangster.

47:47.540 --> 47:51.380
What are you, like, fucking Tony Montana?
What's the plan? Hmm?

47:51.460 --> 47:54.710
You gonna be living in a mansion,
fuckin' pet tigers and shit?

47:56.290 --> 47:58.420
Go fuck yourself.

47:59.500 --> 48:01.420
Listen, bruh.

48:02.840 --> 48:06.920
All I'm sayin', you keep fuckin'
with Rue and her friends,

48:07.000 --> 48:09.250
and I'mma kill you.

48:11.880 --> 48:14.500
It's gonna be $5.75, playboy.

48:33.750 --> 48:38.250
An adult bladder can hold
two cups of urine.

48:38.340 --> 48:41.130
But if you're telling your
bladder to hold off because, say,

48:41.210 --> 48:43.960
you're in the worst depression
of your fucking life,

48:44.050 --> 48:46.340
your bladder will
eventually fill.

48:48.590 --> 48:51.090
And what begins to happen is...

48:51.170 --> 48:53.050
all of the toxins
that your kidneys

48:53.130 --> 48:54.540
have pushed into your bladder

48:54.630 --> 48:56.960
begin to travel back
into your kidneys.

49:01.420 --> 49:02.710
Fuck.

49:02.800 --> 49:05.420
I know what you're thinking.
Rue, this is insane.

49:05.500 --> 49:08.290
Don't get a kidney infection.
Walk to the bathroom.

49:09.460 --> 49:13.090
Trust me, I'm thinking
the same fuckin' thing.

49:16.540 --> 49:18.250
Like a little pot?

50:27.380 --> 50:29.710
- You remind me of her.
- Who?

50:31.500 --> 50:33.630
My best friend.

50:33.710 --> 50:36.250
So what's she like?

50:36.340 --> 50:39.920
- Honestly?
- Kind of a mess.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.710
So I'm a mess?

50:42.540 --> 50:45.460
- Yeah.
- How am I a mess?

50:47.090 --> 50:49.960
I don't know yet.

51:02.500 --> 51:04.800
- Should I text her?
- No.

51:26.090 --> 51:28.210
You only get one more.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.710
Fuck.

52:20.670 --> 52:22.050
Jules.

52:23.130 --> 52:24.630
What are you doing here?

52:24.710 --> 52:27.340
- You texted me.
- I did?

52:27.670 --> 52:29.670
Did you not want me to come?

52:31.710 --> 52:34.210
You here alone?

52:39.460 --> 52:41.170
No, no, no, no, no.

52:47.290 --> 52:49.000
I'm scared of you, Nate.

52:49.090 --> 52:51.590
I'm sorry. For everything.

52:53.130 --> 52:55.420
I'm sorry for hurting you.

52:57.210 --> 52:58.630
You...

52:58.710 --> 53:02.290
you were the most beautiful
person that I've ever known.

53:02.380 --> 53:04.840
I'm Tyler.

53:04.920 --> 53:08.250
I'm the person that
you fell in love with.

53:08.340 --> 53:10.880
I wanna kill you.

53:10.960 --> 53:13.380
I'm yours. I'm all yours.

53:26.920 --> 53:29.090
You're a pussy.

53:29.170 --> 53:31.380
You're a bitch.

53:33.710 --> 53:36.380
And I wish the whole
fucking world could know.

54:02.960 --> 54:05.540
I know this isn't
gonna end well.

54:25.920 --> 54:27.420
Hello?

54:29.420 --> 54:31.380
Yeah, I'd like to
report a crime.

54:46.420 --> 54:48.090
Mom.

54:51.590 --> 54:53.460
I think I need your help.

55:10.090 --> 55:11.250
Come here.

55:11.710 --> 55:14.750
Come here. It's okay.
It's okay. I love you so much.

55:14.840 --> 55:18.500
I love you so much.
You're so beautiful.

55:33.380 --> 55:34.630
Fuck!

55:34.710 --> 55:36.500
East Highland PD!

55:36.590 --> 55:38.130
- Open the door!
- Come on, bro.

55:38.210 --> 55:39.800
Hurry the fuck up out there!

55:39.880 --> 55:42.090
We know you're in there.
Open up! Fuck!

55:42.170 --> 55:44.130
Goddamn it!

55:44.670 --> 55:47.050
- Fuck, bro.
- What the fuck, man?

55:47.130 --> 55:49.380
Come on, bruh.
Hurry up, for real, man.

55:51.500 --> 55:54.090
Unlock the door! Open up, now!

55:54.170 --> 55:56.130
Goddamn it!

56:04.540 --> 56:07.050
Rue, what's wrong?

56:13.630 --> 56:15.710
Okay, baby. Come on.

56:16.380 --> 56:18.540
Come on. Come on.

56:19.500 --> 56:20.840
I had a therapist once

56:20.920 --> 56:23.540
who said that these states
will wax and wane.

56:23.630 --> 56:25.170
Which gave my mother relief,

56:25.250 --> 56:27.340
because it meant that
in the bad times,

56:27.420 --> 56:29.540
there would be good times.

56:32.630 --> 56:34.000
But it also gave her anxiety

56:34.090 --> 56:36.130
because it meant that
in the good times,

56:36.210 --> 56:38.630
there would be bad times.

56:38.710 --> 56:39.880
It always confused me,

56:39.960 --> 56:42.540
because I didn't really
know what it meant.

56:42.880 --> 56:44.800
It's okay, baby.

56:46.050 --> 56:47.590
It's okay.

56:48.500 --> 56:50.090
But it did sound a lot calmer

56:50.170 --> 56:52.420
than the way
I would describe it.

57:02.090 --> 57:05.630
I think I need to go
back on medication.

57:12.960 --> 57:17.960
- There you go.
- How you feel? Okay?

57:24.090 --> 57:26.920
I know you're feeling low
right now, baby.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.750
But the fact that you didn't turn
back means you're gettin' better.

57:33.290 --> 57:35.250
It does.

57:37.290 --> 57:38.800
It does.

57:42.540 --> 57:44.460
Granted, I didn't
realize until later

57:44.540 --> 57:47.710
what waxing and waning implied.

57:47.800 --> 57:50.590
That these feelings
were fixed and constant

57:50.670 --> 57:53.800
and would never end
for the rest of my life.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.920
Last night,

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:47.250
I couldn't stop thinking
about the day you were born.

01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:49.800
What if I heard a voice...

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.290
Some narrator who said...

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.460
"Here's what's going to happen."

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.880
Obviously, there's something
wrong with her!

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.630
But all this happened
because I left.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.050
I love Cassie
because how relatable she was.

01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:50.800
She's trying to find her purpose
in life.

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:54.130
I felt like that's
a very realistic representation

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.090
of what it's like to be a girl.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.420
Before we went into filming,
I actually got to sit down

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.960
and build
Cassie's character book.

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:08.090
That is an interactive
timeline diary

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:09.630
of her entire life, and so,

01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:11.920
something that happened
when she was two with her dad

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.540
will create how she reacts

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:15.670
when she opens
her ice-skating present

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:17.090
on her tenth birthday.

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:19.710
Cassie's dad
always wanted her to become

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.840
- a professional ice skater.
- Wow!

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:23.840
But her dad
couldn't afford lessons

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.960
so he stopped encouraging her.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.840
Cassie's father left
when she was growing up,

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.840
and she lost this man
that she looked at

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.920
as a superhero, and so,
she's always looked for

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.090
that kind of love to replace,
and Cassie feels like

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:44.000
she needs these men
to tell her she's beautiful,

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:47.000
or make her feel like
she has to accept herself.

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:48.460
Even though she's had...

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.710
these little things
here and there,

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.800
McKay is her first
real relationship.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.840
You watch all these movies
and TV shows,

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:59.000
and your idea of what
teenage love is supposed to be,

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:01.670
and that's not what it is
in her life.

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:05.960
And she's searching for what
she's expecting it to be.

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:10.750
I really love you, McKay.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.210
What if this is what I'm
supposed to do with my life?

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:18.670
Throughout episode seven,
you see Cassie asking herself,

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.880
"Should I tell McKay
that I'm pregnant?"

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:23.630
She couldn't go to her friends.
She didn't feel like...

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:27.670
And the one person she had there
for her was her mom.

01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:33.840
- I think I need your help.
- It's okay.

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:40.250
Cassie realizes that maybe
her mom does know what to do,

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.630
and maybe she should listen.
Her mom was...

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:44.840
amazing and helpful
and there for her,

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.540
and I think that's really
important for a lot of teenagers

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:50.420
because they don't think
they need their parents.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.500
I mean, I went through
so many things myself

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:54.020
where I'm like,
"Oh, I know what's what.

01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:56.960
"I don't need my mom." And I wish
I would have gone to her first

01:03:57.050 --> 01:04:00.050
without making
different decisions that I did.

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:03.460
I'm so proud to be a part
of this show

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.420
because as an actor, you dream

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.750
of these very gritty,
realistic roles,

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.000
and I feel that
Euphoria has that.

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:15.840
Being on a show that represents
so many different people,

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.460
I hope that people
find themselves

01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:21.170
in these different characters
and know that they're not alone.
