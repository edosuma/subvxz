00:55.506 --> 00:57.232
One, two, testing.

00:57.267 --> 01:00.925
Over it!

01:27.435 --> 01:29.230
Argh, you gobshite.

01:39.378 --> 01:41.380
Ah, you're fucking whiny...

01:55.670 --> 01:57.430
All right, you fucking cunt.

02:05.507 --> 02:07.060
This one goes out to Alistair.

02:07.095 --> 02:09.752
Fuck you for leaving me.

02:10.719 --> 02:13.170
That was a bit dark.
I'm... I'm sorry.

03:43.018 --> 03:44.088
Fuck!

05:19.494 --> 05:23.740
Hey, dolly, get up!

05:25.673 --> 05:26.674
Up!

05:40.722 --> 05:44.312
Have you got any mortadella?

05:44.346 --> 05:46.141
No, we don't stock mortadella.

05:57.221 --> 06:00.362
Two rotisserie chickens for
the price of one.

06:00.397 --> 06:04.539
Today only. Two rotisserie
chickens for the price of one.

06:04.574 --> 06:08.543
Aye, so, Ryan said to his mam that if we got
the tables and the chairs out the catalog,

06:08.578 --> 06:10.303
then we'd have enough money
to get the floor done.

06:10.338 --> 06:13.375
'Cause for me, we were needing the
floor done more than the table.

06:13.410 --> 06:15.274
So, she was like,
"All right. Okay."

06:15.308 --> 06:16.551
So, she looked at
the catalog

06:16.586 --> 06:18.726
and picked out a table,
a nice table.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.004
And she was gonna pay for it, but
then, I looked at the catalog,

06:21.038 --> 06:22.488
and the price
was just for the table.

06:22.523 --> 06:23.731
You had to pay for
the chairs separately.

06:23.765 --> 06:25.767
After that, we were looking
at £300-400,

06:25.802 --> 06:27.631
when we thought
it was just 150.

06:27.666 --> 06:29.357
And the floor was 300.

06:29.391 --> 06:30.565
It's nice, isn't it?

06:30.600 --> 06:32.256
Truly modern.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.569
Ryan didn't want it, but then,
Kelly across the road got it,

06:34.604 --> 06:36.675
and then,
suddenly he wanted it.

06:36.709 --> 06:38.159
So, I didn't really know
what to do,

06:38.193 --> 06:40.230
but then his mam bought the
table and chairs for us anyway.

06:44.372 --> 06:46.167
Donna, can I go
out with Nate?

06:46.201 --> 06:48.307
You're not allowed in here.
Go and play or something.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.757
You can't tell me
what to do.

06:49.791 --> 06:51.552
Do you want me
to tell your dad?

06:51.586 --> 06:53.208
Play! Now! BOY: Ugh!

06:53.243 --> 06:55.141
You ever gonna have
any of your own?

06:55.176 --> 06:56.660
No. Not really bothered.

07:08.638 --> 07:10.053
Aurora borealis.

07:11.537 --> 07:12.745
She's coming.

07:22.272 --> 07:24.032
For a family man
who has a lot of kids,

07:24.067 --> 07:26.276
this is the perfect vehicle
for you.

07:26.310 --> 07:28.347
I can fit all my camping gear
in the back...

07:31.626 --> 07:33.317
For a vehicle this size,
this baby...

07:33.352 --> 07:34.387
Hey.

07:34.422 --> 07:38.115
I could take
a turn on this going...

08:59.162 --> 09:00.094
Hello.

09:00.128 --> 09:01.682
Put down the phone. Why?

09:01.716 --> 09:03.753
Just hang up.
...someone to talk to...

09:06.341 --> 09:08.412
Pick up the phone! Yes, Mother.

09:10.829 --> 09:12.520
Another helpline caller.

09:12.554 --> 09:15.212
I really wish your father would
get his finger out of his arse

09:15.247 --> 09:16.524
and change our number.

09:16.558 --> 09:18.871
He takes so long
to do anything.

09:18.906 --> 09:22.426
How long have I been asking him about
painting the back wall in the living room?

09:22.461 --> 09:24.739
He takes a year
to turn around, that man.

09:24.774 --> 09:27.362
Have you been
taking your tablets?

09:27.397 --> 09:28.536
No. Really?

09:28.570 --> 09:30.331
No, I haven't.
I can't swallow pills.

09:30.365 --> 09:33.265
It's physically impossible for me
without gagging and throwing up.

09:33.299 --> 09:34.784
My throat says, "No!"

09:34.818 --> 09:36.993
The doctor said you'd see
a big improvement.

09:37.027 --> 09:39.133
I don't want those weird
pill space cadet eyes.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.479
I'd rather just
drink like you.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.757
These people know
what they're talking about.

09:42.792 --> 09:44.138
Dr. Smith was the one who...

09:44.172 --> 09:46.623
At least I know
where I'm at with alcohol.

09:46.657 --> 09:48.245
And he's right.
I mean...

09:48.280 --> 09:50.558
You and Dr. Smith just want
to brush it all under the...

09:50.592 --> 09:51.628
You're on a slow train
to nowhere.

09:51.662 --> 09:53.147
He said that? I saw him at bingo.

09:53.181 --> 09:54.769
He actually said that? He thinks

09:54.804 --> 09:56.667
you don't have any hobbies
or real passion...

09:56.702 --> 09:57.703
I know about cheese.

09:57.738 --> 09:59.049
You look gray... Excuse me?

09:59.084 --> 10:01.776
But worst of all,
you don't have a boyfriend.

10:01.811 --> 10:03.260
"Worst of all"?

10:03.295 --> 10:05.090
You should have
a boyfriend by now.

10:05.124 --> 10:06.229
And what's wrong with cheese?

10:06.263 --> 10:07.713
I just worry about you.
That's all.

10:07.748 --> 10:10.095
And I'm really trying to make
that mean something to me.

10:10.129 --> 10:11.924
At your age, I was already
pregnant with your...

11:47.157 --> 11:50.851
Have you done it yet?
No, no, we have not.

12:01.413 --> 12:03.001
Hello?

12:04.692 --> 12:06.107
Anyone?

12:06.867 --> 12:08.661
Chinese for dinner.

12:13.011 --> 12:14.529
It's getting cold!

12:29.337 --> 12:30.683
Oh, fuck.

12:33.514 --> 12:34.480
Hello?

12:34.515 --> 12:36.310
Hello.
Is this the helpline?

12:36.344 --> 12:37.863
No, you've got
the wrong number.

12:37.898 --> 12:41.039
Oh... Hello... Hello? Okay.

15:19.128 --> 15:21.854
Vodka and vodka, please!

15:46.879 --> 15:48.571
Uh, yeah.

15:49.468 --> 15:51.056
Got any music?

15:51.091 --> 15:52.402
You want something to drink?

15:52.437 --> 15:53.576
Yes, please.

15:53.610 --> 15:55.302
Just help yourself to anything
you want in the minibar.

15:56.648 --> 15:58.098
Okay.

16:08.522 --> 16:10.765
Oh!

16:10.800 --> 16:11.973
You guys can really
drink here.

16:12.008 --> 16:13.630
Makes working in
a supermarket easier.

16:13.665 --> 16:16.288
Can't really conjure up the energy
to resent it through a hangover.

16:21.328 --> 16:22.881
This is a good song.

16:27.230 --> 16:29.543
♪ La, la, la, la, la...

16:31.027 --> 16:33.063
Cheers. Oh, boy.
You're a mess.

16:33.098 --> 16:34.617
Now you're a mess, too.

16:35.687 --> 16:36.929
Mmm!

16:36.964 --> 16:40.312
Let's go.

18:33.839 --> 18:35.255
I'm sorry.

18:36.773 --> 18:38.223
They're so aggressive.

18:38.258 --> 18:39.535
What, the pigs? Yeah.

18:39.569 --> 18:42.331
Aye, 'cause you know,
gangsters apparently have,

18:42.365 --> 18:44.298
like, pig farms.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.300
So when they kill someone

18:46.335 --> 18:49.476
they can use the pigs
to eat the bodies.

18:50.304 --> 18:51.547
Pigs eat humans?

18:51.581 --> 18:54.135
Aye. And, you know,
for gangsters and that

18:54.170 --> 18:55.344
so they don't get caught.

18:55.378 --> 18:57.035
'Cause there's
no evidence left. That's dark!

18:57.069 --> 18:58.312
That's dark as fuck.

18:58.347 --> 18:59.693
That's what happens.

18:59.727 --> 19:02.143
What time does the Sing for
Scotland repeat start?

19:02.178 --> 19:04.180
Starts in half an hour.

19:04.214 --> 19:06.734
Right. Then, we have
to take these now...

19:06.769 --> 19:07.873
Yes. Yes, we do.

19:07.908 --> 19:09.323
So we're coming up
for the first song.

19:09.358 --> 19:10.428
I'm off if youse are
gonna be gurning all day.

19:10.462 --> 19:13.051
No, D...

19:13.085 --> 19:14.086
Donna...

19:14.121 --> 19:15.536
You know what? What?

19:15.571 --> 19:17.607
You've got a bad attitude.

19:17.642 --> 19:19.022
Ugh! So immature, honestly.

19:19.057 --> 19:20.265
Stay!

19:20.300 --> 19:22.129
I'm not gonna stay and
watch youse mix drugs and...

19:22.163 --> 19:23.475
It's just not good.

19:25.132 --> 19:26.685
Mix...

19:30.137 --> 19:33.036
Eh, I...
I can't even taste it.

19:33.071 --> 19:34.659
Here, have some tea.

19:35.453 --> 19:37.040
Give me the tea.

19:37.075 --> 19:38.766
Ugh, that's cold. Ugh.Ugh.

19:39.422 --> 19:41.597
Oh, that's disgusting.

19:41.631 --> 19:44.220
I can't believe you
don't have a CD player.

19:44.254 --> 19:47.361
Seriously. Who doesn't
have a CD player?

19:47.396 --> 19:48.880
Me.

19:50.399 --> 19:52.090
It's so weird.

19:54.403 --> 19:55.818
Just make your own music.

19:58.407 --> 20:00.270
Mmm. Aye, Ben took it.

20:00.305 --> 20:01.962
Look, he's not coming over,
is he?

20:01.996 --> 20:03.032
No how.

20:04.999 --> 20:06.069
You know what it's like.

20:06.104 --> 20:08.900
We can't really, like,
talk properly when he's here.

20:09.866 --> 20:11.420
Yeah, we can.

20:11.454 --> 20:14.319
No, we can't. Your
responses are all like,

20:14.354 --> 20:16.873
"Oh, Ben..."

20:17.874 --> 20:19.324
Oh, this is offensive.

20:20.670 --> 20:22.845
Shut up. Like you're different.

20:22.879 --> 20:24.571
I don't know.
You're just, like, not you.

20:24.605 --> 20:27.608
Uh, I'm more me.
I can be myself with Ben.

20:31.060 --> 20:33.856
Mmm. I can be myself
around you.

20:33.890 --> 20:35.651
I thought you were the same
with me.

20:35.685 --> 20:38.723
Uh, aye.
But it's different.

20:38.757 --> 20:40.656
I'm closer to him
than anyone.

20:41.450 --> 20:42.899
What about your dad?

20:44.211 --> 20:45.695
What about him?

20:46.662 --> 20:48.180
Doesn't he have
a CD player,

20:48.215 --> 20:52.461
or literally anything that we
can play some fucking music on?

20:52.909 --> 20:54.221
No.

20:54.255 --> 20:55.981
Just has that
police scanner.

20:56.016 --> 20:59.122
It started off as a precaution,
now he listens to it like music.

21:00.710 --> 21:02.125
What?

21:03.161 --> 21:04.714
Ow!

21:04.749 --> 21:06.889
Oh, my God!
I'm sensitive to pigs.

21:06.923 --> 21:09.547
I had a bad experience
in my childhood.

21:09.581 --> 21:12.066
Don't do that! I don't even wanna know.

21:12.101 --> 21:15.829
I just got these in.
They're called Ballet Slippers.

21:15.863 --> 21:16.692
Ooh!

21:16.726 --> 21:18.141
We'll make good money
from these.

21:18.176 --> 21:19.488
Decent amount of MDMA.

21:19.522 --> 21:20.937
Those make me horny.

21:22.007 --> 21:23.181
I haven't had sex in ages.

21:23.215 --> 21:24.700
Ugh!

21:24.734 --> 21:26.253
Why "ugh"?

21:26.287 --> 21:27.634
What's "ugh"?

21:27.668 --> 21:30.464
I'm lucky me and Ben have
such a healthy sex life.

21:30.499 --> 21:33.640
We've been doing it,
like, twice a day.

21:34.364 --> 21:35.469
Doesn't it hurt?

21:35.504 --> 21:37.160
What? Sex.

21:37.195 --> 21:38.541
I mean, it must
be pretty shit

21:38.576 --> 21:40.957
to know there's guaranteed pain
every time you have sex.

21:40.992 --> 21:42.718
How would you know
if it's painful?

21:42.752 --> 21:44.651
Plus, we don't even do anal.

21:44.685 --> 21:46.998
Then, how do you have sex?

21:47.377 --> 21:49.103
We rub...

21:52.831 --> 21:54.488
What?

21:54.523 --> 21:56.179
Sex doesn't mean
purely penetration.

21:56.214 --> 21:58.872
Sex is everything, all of it.

21:58.906 --> 22:01.253
Just because I don't let him fuck
me up the arse, it doesn't mean...

22:01.288 --> 22:02.807
You've never had sex?

22:05.154 --> 22:06.258
You've never had sex.

22:10.470 --> 22:12.195
Has he told the church
he's gay yet?

22:12.437 --> 22:13.680
No.

22:16.545 --> 22:18.270
I think I'm starting
to come up.

22:18.823 --> 22:19.996
Mmm...

22:23.310 --> 22:26.382
I went to see her,
and she was just lying there.

22:26.416 --> 22:27.866
You know, she wasn't
really conscious.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.420
And I remember saying
to my mum,

22:30.455 --> 22:31.594
"Mum, what do you see?"

22:31.629 --> 22:32.595
And you know what? WOMAN: What?

22:32.630 --> 22:35.840
I sang to her
and then...

22:37.255 --> 22:38.981
As I was singing, she...

22:40.085 --> 22:41.259
She passed away.

22:47.299 --> 22:48.715
She's fucking amazing.

22:54.168 --> 22:55.376
You could do this.

22:55.411 --> 22:57.240
I want to be her.

22:57.275 --> 22:58.552
You're better than her.

22:58.587 --> 22:59.933
And better-looking.

23:06.353 --> 23:07.803
Whoo!

23:28.582 --> 23:29.756
Whoo!

23:50.846 --> 23:52.848
Everything's going
back to normal.

23:53.538 --> 23:54.712
Mmm.

24:02.512 --> 24:03.962
Let's never go out there.

24:19.253 --> 24:20.323
Hello.

24:23.568 --> 24:24.638
Hello?

24:24.673 --> 24:26.260
Hi.

24:26.295 --> 24:27.814
Hi, who's this?

24:28.987 --> 24:30.161
Who's this?

24:33.543 --> 24:34.959
Charlotte.

24:35.718 --> 24:38.687
Uh, are you a helper, Charlotte?

24:38.721 --> 24:40.481
No, you've got
the wrong number.

24:40.516 --> 24:43.036
The helpline is 49626.

24:44.244 --> 24:46.487
I'll bet you're having a
right laugh about this.

24:46.522 --> 24:49.767
No. It's one digit off.
It's an easy mistake to make.

24:49.801 --> 24:52.459
You'll be laughing about this
with your friends, won't you?

24:52.493 --> 24:57.050
No, I'm not laughing. We get
these calls all the time.

24:57.084 --> 25:00.985
I was ringing the wrong bloody
number this whole time.

25:01.019 --> 25:04.782
It took me a year just to pluck
up the courage to do this.

25:05.645 --> 25:07.577
Well, I'm sorry you got me.

25:07.612 --> 25:09.959
I've been building up to it for months.

25:14.584 --> 25:16.103
How come?

25:16.138 --> 25:19.072
Oh! I feel like an idiot.

25:19.866 --> 25:22.006
Are you laughing at me, Charlotte?

25:22.454 --> 25:24.077
No.

25:24.111 --> 25:27.356
I'm too embarrassed to
talk to anyone about this.

25:29.496 --> 25:30.704
About what?

25:32.533 --> 25:34.466
I want to go to sleep

25:34.501 --> 25:37.193
for a very long time.

25:40.438 --> 25:42.336
So do I.

25:42.371 --> 25:44.753
Well, I wasn't expecting that!

25:47.272 --> 25:49.896
So what's the big hoo-ha
with sleep?

25:55.625 --> 25:57.489
No, we don't stock mortadella.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.286
Good morning, miss.

26:06.153 --> 26:07.465
Um...

26:07.499 --> 26:08.708
How did you...
Like...

26:08.742 --> 26:09.985
Uh, how did you
find me?

26:10.019 --> 26:12.297
Uh, there's only a couple
of supermarkets in town.

26:12.332 --> 26:13.574
Well...

26:13.609 --> 26:14.921
What time do you get off?

26:14.955 --> 26:17.095
I think I finish in, like,
five minutes.

26:17.130 --> 26:18.096
Great.

26:18.648 --> 26:20.098
I'll wait outside.

26:20.133 --> 26:21.306
Okay.Mmm-hmm.

26:21.686 --> 26:22.894
Great.

26:28.520 --> 26:32.179
Rotisserie chickens
are still on special...

26:48.540 --> 26:49.852
When are you leaving?

26:49.887 --> 26:51.578
I don't know.

26:51.612 --> 26:52.959
I didn't get
a return ticket.

26:54.477 --> 26:55.409
Oh.

26:56.479 --> 26:58.412
The sun goes down early here.

26:59.689 --> 27:00.829
Does it?

27:02.900 --> 27:04.418
Hello?

27:04.453 --> 27:06.282
Hey, darling.

27:06.317 --> 27:08.388
God, what a smart girl.

27:09.389 --> 27:10.528
I'm so proud of you.

27:11.529 --> 27:12.944
That's great.

27:14.428 --> 27:15.775
Absolutely.

27:15.809 --> 27:18.432
Um...
Yeah, I'll be back soon.

27:18.467 --> 27:21.056
I know, I know... ALISTAIR: Why can't you
hold my hand in public?

27:24.024 --> 27:25.301
I don't know, look...

27:26.509 --> 27:28.649
...for a couple of days.

27:28.684 --> 27:31.066
Yeah, I know I've been gone a
while, but I'll be back soon.

27:31.100 --> 27:32.722
You said you'd tell the church.

27:32.757 --> 27:36.036
Please. We're having
a good night.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.831
- You should
tell the church. - I will. I will.

27:37.866 --> 27:39.246
Which center?

27:41.386 --> 27:43.423
Aw! Thanks for calling.

27:45.390 --> 27:47.358
Okay. I love you.

27:51.534 --> 27:53.019
How old is your daughter?

27:54.675 --> 27:56.643
Oh, she's eight.

27:56.677 --> 27:58.610
She's climbing the walls
'cause it's almost Christmas.

28:03.961 --> 28:06.066
It gets expensive
when they get older.

28:07.792 --> 28:09.345
You don't wanna hear
about that.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.416
No... I do.

28:14.281 --> 28:15.317
She wants a mobile.

28:15.351 --> 28:17.940
She's eight, and she
wants a mobile phone.

28:18.941 --> 28:20.184
What about her mam?

28:20.218 --> 28:21.012
Oh, she's set.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.462
That's probably why
she left me.

28:24.844 --> 28:26.086
Good luck getting down.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.709
Come on. Alistair, please.

28:28.744 --> 28:30.090
Why am I ruining...

28:30.125 --> 28:32.334
Alistair, don't start
this tonight. Come on.

28:32.368 --> 28:34.025
When are you
gonna tell the church?

28:34.060 --> 28:36.303
When are you
gonna tell your dad?

28:52.941 --> 28:55.012
Argh! My leg.

28:56.496 --> 28:58.049
Argh, it's gone numb.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.983
Been sitting here too long.

29:01.018 --> 29:02.951
How long have you
been playing that thing?

29:04.642 --> 29:05.677
Four days.

29:10.959 --> 29:12.408
Alistair!

29:14.548 --> 29:15.618
Help me.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.346
Alistair.

29:19.381 --> 29:20.485
Help me, son.

29:23.557 --> 29:24.904
Help me.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.067
Ooh!

29:50.653 --> 29:51.654
I feel 13 again.

29:52.932 --> 29:54.278
Oh! Oh, no!

29:55.831 --> 29:58.006
Fuck me!

30:02.113 --> 30:05.047
Fuck. Fuck, it's cold!

30:07.084 --> 30:09.155
Fuck you, cold!

30:37.045 --> 30:38.356
Stop it.

31:53.190 --> 31:55.882
Hi, Charlotte.

31:55.916 --> 31:57.125
How are you today?

31:57.159 --> 31:58.471
I'm okay, thanks.
How are you?

31:58.505 --> 32:01.439
All the better for hearing
a familiar voice.

32:02.440 --> 32:05.443
Um, I went to
the clootie well today.

32:06.030 --> 32:07.583
The one that's here?

32:07.618 --> 32:08.860
Aye.

32:08.895 --> 32:10.138
Did you hang some clothes up?

32:10.172 --> 32:11.794
Yeah, I took like
a bit of a T-shirt

32:11.829 --> 32:14.176
and then put it in the water
and then tied it up.

32:14.211 --> 32:18.077
So, we'll see if that
does what it's supposed to.

32:18.111 --> 32:21.632
I used to take the kids up
there when they were little.

32:21.666 --> 32:22.874
Oh, yeah?

32:22.909 --> 32:24.324
How many kids
do you have?

32:24.359 --> 32:25.118
Two.

32:25.153 --> 32:26.913
Well, they're grown up now.

32:26.947 --> 32:28.363
Kids of their own.

32:28.397 --> 32:30.399
How many grandkids
do you have?

32:30.434 --> 32:34.058
Oh, I don't want to talk
about that.

32:34.093 --> 32:35.956
I don't like them
coming round,

32:35.991 --> 32:37.682
seeing me like this.

32:40.340 --> 32:43.102
They want to put me
in a home, Charlotte.

32:43.999 --> 32:45.863
I'm a nuisance to them.

32:48.417 --> 32:50.626
Look, I'm sure
you're not a nuisance.

32:52.904 --> 32:56.184
They probably just want you
to be looked after properly.

32:58.634 --> 33:00.567
I'm on my own now.

33:02.155 --> 33:03.570
My wife is gone.

33:11.026 --> 33:12.924
I'm a burden to my children

33:15.203 --> 33:16.894
They want to get rid of me.

33:21.140 --> 33:22.762
Well, you're not a burden
on me.

33:23.383 --> 33:25.074
I like talking to you.

33:25.109 --> 33:28.699
Do you? Aye. I do.

33:28.733 --> 33:31.253
I don't really have
anyone to talk to either.

33:31.288 --> 33:33.359
Like, I try to talk
to them, and...

33:33.393 --> 33:36.914
But when I try to,
it's like they can't hear me.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.260
I can't tell if they
can't hear me,

33:38.295 --> 33:40.193
or they're ignoring me.

33:40.228 --> 33:42.437
Either way, it's like
the world's gone deaf.

33:43.334 --> 33:45.336
How old are you, Charlotte?

33:46.165 --> 33:47.511
Twenty-four.

33:47.545 --> 33:50.583
You must have friends
you can talk to.

33:50.617 --> 33:52.136
Not really.

33:52.171 --> 33:55.588
Everyone I get through to
tends to fuck off.

33:57.900 --> 34:00.800
Why did you go to
the clootie well, Charlotte?

34:04.804 --> 34:05.770
To heal.

34:05.805 --> 34:08.601
Apparently it's supposed to,
like, do that.

34:09.809 --> 34:12.431
Now, you aren't hurting
yourself, are you?

34:12.467 --> 34:13.744
Nah.

34:13.777 --> 34:16.436
I'm letting other people
do that to me.

34:16.471 --> 34:20.922
Sometimes it feels like I'm
asking people to do that to me.

34:20.958 --> 34:24.755
You should take responsibility
for your own life.

34:24.789 --> 34:25.755
Yeah, that's depressing.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.620
Speaking of which,
any plans for Christmas?

34:27.654 --> 34:30.312
Oh, just a quiet one
this year.

34:32.763 --> 34:35.628
Why don't you invite
your family round for dinner?

34:35.661 --> 34:38.147
Oh, no, no.

34:38.181 --> 34:40.460
They won't want to see me.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.255
It should be a happy day.

34:42.290 --> 34:44.982
I wouldn't want
to take that away from them.

34:46.742 --> 34:52.438
You know, I still set a place
for Edith on the table.

34:52.472 --> 34:54.784
Who's Edith? My wife.

34:55.889 --> 34:58.271
I'm not scaring you,
am I, Charlotte?

35:57.503 --> 35:59.919
Fuck off!
What is this?

36:02.991 --> 36:04.337
I'm back.

36:04.372 --> 36:06.235
You're not getting rid of me
that easily.

36:06.270 --> 36:08.341
Ha-ha! What?

36:08.376 --> 36:09.653
What's going on?

36:09.687 --> 36:11.171
Why? What the fuck's going on?

36:11.206 --> 36:13.035
His dad's been taken
to hospital again.

36:13.070 --> 36:14.071
All right.

36:16.625 --> 36:18.800
Well, I'll go up
to the hospital with him then.

36:18.834 --> 36:21.112
We're going up first
thing in the morning.

36:22.217 --> 36:23.874
Don't you have church
in the morning?

36:25.462 --> 36:28.603
I'll figure it out.

36:28.637 --> 36:30.501
Will you? Yeah.

36:30.536 --> 36:33.021
When are you gonna figure out
telling them that you're gay?

36:34.781 --> 36:36.542
Excuse me?

36:36.576 --> 36:39.027
You should probably tell them
about Alistair at some point.

36:39.061 --> 36:40.615
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

36:40.649 --> 36:43.065
I'm someone that
cares about Alistair,

36:43.100 --> 36:44.377
and cares about
his well-being.

36:44.412 --> 36:46.483
Yeah, so do I, and I think
you should go home.

36:46.517 --> 36:47.967
I should be here
for Alistair.

36:49.417 --> 36:50.935
Well, I'm spending
the night with him.

36:50.970 --> 36:53.628
Then I'll spend the night
in his dad's bed.

36:53.662 --> 36:55.975
In case he needs me.

36:56.769 --> 36:58.667
No one needs you.

36:58.702 --> 37:00.635
He wants to be with me.
Now, just go home.

37:01.429 --> 37:02.913
At least I'm not
ashamed of him.

37:06.365 --> 37:07.469
Bye.

38:06.079 --> 38:07.460
He just passed away.

38:15.779 --> 38:17.470
I think you should go now.

38:43.703 --> 38:46.016
Oh, it's you.

38:55.543 --> 38:57.510
Um...
Are you leaving?

38:58.028 --> 38:59.961
Yeah. Yeah.

39:00.582 --> 39:02.653
It's time for me to go.

39:02.688 --> 39:04.206
But first... What are you doing?
Oh, my God.

39:04.241 --> 39:06.277
We're gonna order
some room service...

39:06.312 --> 39:08.176
Ahhh! Oh, my God!

39:12.421 --> 39:13.699
We're really early.

39:13.733 --> 39:15.183
Just a little time
for a cup of tea?

39:15.217 --> 39:16.805
Yeah, no, I...
Um...

39:16.840 --> 39:18.427
I've got to get my tr...
My tickets, still.

39:18.462 --> 39:19.843
Okay. Aye. Well, um...

39:20.499 --> 39:21.845
See you, then.

39:27.298 --> 39:28.541
Bye.Bye.

39:29.266 --> 39:31.233
What's your name?

39:31.268 --> 39:32.821
My what? What's your name?

39:32.856 --> 39:35.306
Say what?
I can't... I can't quite...

39:35.341 --> 39:36.929
Do you even wanna
know my name?

39:38.309 --> 39:39.621
Bye.

40:02.679 --> 40:04.853
Ah! There you are.

40:04.888 --> 40:07.200
Right, Jim. We need to do
something with that garden.

40:07.235 --> 40:08.443
It's a bomb site.

40:08.477 --> 40:10.618
It's out the back.
No one can see it.

40:10.652 --> 40:12.654
That's why I've
left it till now.

40:12.689 --> 40:15.070
But I'm sick of having to pull
the back curtains

40:15.105 --> 40:16.589
any time I have a guest.

40:16.624 --> 40:18.073
Or we should get blinds.

40:18.108 --> 40:19.868
Oh, for God's sake. We don't
have money for all this.

40:19.903 --> 40:22.250
You were meant to be here
five minutes ago.

40:22.284 --> 40:23.251
I do enough for everyone...

40:28.705 --> 40:30.327
You got five minutes.

40:32.743 --> 40:34.434
Dolly!

40:34.469 --> 40:36.229
It's your dad's work party.

40:37.541 --> 40:40.993
Come on, everybody
wants to see you there.

40:53.212 --> 40:54.523
You getting your dress on?

40:54.558 --> 40:56.215
I'm putting a dress on.

40:56.249 --> 40:58.838
Whoo-hoo! That's my girl.

41:16.097 --> 41:17.201
Hi.

41:17.236 --> 41:18.478
Hi, Marie,
how are you?

41:18.513 --> 41:19.928
Not bad. Yourself?

41:19.963 --> 41:21.033
Not bad.

41:21.067 --> 41:23.656
I drove here with my
boyfriend in my car.

41:24.105 --> 41:24.968
You got a car?

41:25.382 --> 41:27.142
Yeah.

41:27.177 --> 41:28.212
And a boyfriend.

41:28.247 --> 41:29.420
Nice.

41:29.455 --> 41:30.732
But I'm drunk.

41:30.767 --> 41:33.562
What? You can't drive home
now, can you?

41:33.597 --> 41:34.805
I'm way too drunk.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.705
Whoo! You drunken bitch!

41:38.844 --> 41:40.708
That's enough, Marie.
Come on.

41:40.742 --> 41:42.123
Let's get you
some scones.

43:44.763 --> 43:46.178
Hello?

43:51.666 --> 43:52.943
What are you doing here?

43:56.913 --> 43:58.466
I come here all the time.

44:02.470 --> 44:03.505
What are you doing here?

44:17.105 --> 44:18.935
I read about it
on the Internet.

44:29.393 --> 44:30.601
What did it say?

44:33.535 --> 44:38.471
It says if the fall does't
do it, the train will finish you off.

45:23.206 --> 45:25.622
Let's move to California.

45:25.656 --> 45:26.761
What?

45:26.795 --> 45:29.246
We'd have to wear
sunblock every day.

45:29.281 --> 45:30.869
Get a massive fridge.

45:30.903 --> 45:32.836
With loads of
bottled water in it.

45:32.871 --> 45:34.838
And a garbage disposal.

45:34.873 --> 45:36.426
And therapists.

45:36.460 --> 45:39.049
Oh, my God.
I need to talk to my shrink.

45:39.774 --> 45:40.982
Seriously.

45:42.673 --> 45:43.951
If we could just...

45:46.781 --> 45:48.024
Do it.

45:54.513 --> 45:55.928
I don't have
a passport.

46:00.933 --> 46:03.039
We could just go to
the post office and get one.

46:07.629 --> 46:08.907
I can't afford it.

46:13.152 --> 46:14.602
So what's with the, uh...

46:15.465 --> 46:16.638
The stuff?

46:30.514 --> 46:33.172
I'm about to start
taking some hormones

46:35.105 --> 46:36.486
to become a girl.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.866
Obviously.

46:39.661 --> 46:40.524
What?

46:42.043 --> 46:44.770
The doctor says I have to
live as a woman for a year

46:44.804 --> 46:46.772
before I can get
the full operation.

46:46.806 --> 46:50.258
Wait a minute. You've, like,
actually been to the doctor?

46:50.293 --> 46:51.363
Aye.

46:53.710 --> 46:54.953
Aye.

46:55.954 --> 46:57.024
Um...

46:59.302 --> 47:01.062
What does Ben
think about it?

47:05.515 --> 47:06.757
I haven't told him.

47:09.070 --> 47:11.624
He's probably gonna
notice at some point.

47:13.454 --> 47:15.697
We haven't really been
speaking a lot recently.

47:19.770 --> 47:20.771
How come?

47:28.227 --> 47:31.161
Because I think the
church knows about me.

47:33.267 --> 47:36.097
He can't be in the church
if they know about you.

47:38.134 --> 47:40.067
Is that why you're thinking
about a sex change?

47:40.101 --> 47:41.447
No, of course not.

47:41.482 --> 47:44.036
Wait a minute. You're literally
changing your gender

47:44.071 --> 47:45.624
to be with this guy.

47:48.385 --> 47:49.248
I'm not.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.250
Then why are you
doing this?

47:51.940 --> 47:53.425
Why the...

47:57.084 --> 47:58.637
Can you help me, please?

48:11.926 --> 48:13.548
Ugh.

48:20.210 --> 48:22.902
Right. Well, first of all,
we are taking this off.

48:22.937 --> 48:24.594
Okay, so...

48:30.151 --> 48:33.085
Is that... Okay. Close your eyes.

48:37.055 --> 48:38.987
Oh, my!
You've got good eyes.

48:39.022 --> 48:40.299
Thank you.

48:40.334 --> 48:41.266
Here.

48:42.819 --> 48:44.131
Pinky...

48:44.924 --> 48:46.650
This little piggy
went to market.

48:49.032 --> 48:52.449
I was thinking
maybe Alice, or Ali.

48:53.140 --> 48:55.073
I like that one.

49:00.147 --> 49:01.320
Open a little bit.

49:55.754 --> 49:56.893
Hey!

49:57.618 --> 49:59.171
Hey! Come back!

50:00.828 --> 50:02.588
Come back, you fucking...

50:37.796 --> 50:38.900
Alistair.

50:45.459 --> 50:46.770
It's okay.

50:47.495 --> 50:49.359
Come on. Come on. Come on.

50:57.056 --> 50:58.713
Easy.

50:58.748 --> 51:00.198
It's all right.

51:14.833 --> 51:16.283
Can I have a tissue?

51:16.766 --> 51:18.733
My sleeves, come on.

51:18.768 --> 51:20.252
Come on, wipe it on it.

51:36.372 --> 51:38.822
My ex-wife has this
beautiful house.

51:45.415 --> 51:47.831
She's putting our daughter
through private school.

51:48.694 --> 51:50.351
I'm not even allowed
to pick her up,

51:50.386 --> 51:52.422
'cause I don't have
a nice enough car.

52:03.157 --> 52:04.710
I'm supposed to be a man.

52:06.298 --> 52:09.474
And I know it's modern times
and blah, blah, blah.

52:12.891 --> 52:16.550
That doesn't change my
primal instinct to provide.

52:18.862 --> 52:19.932
Right?

52:25.766 --> 52:27.077
I'm failing at it.

52:37.087 --> 52:38.088
Failing.

52:41.678 --> 52:42.921
My life was...

52:45.026 --> 52:46.580
Was supposed to
be different.

52:55.002 --> 52:57.004
Can we...
Can we just go?

54:22.330 --> 54:23.435
What? Come on.

54:23.470 --> 54:25.506
No. Oh.Come on. Come on.

54:28.820 --> 54:31.029
I can... I can only dance when I'm drunk.

54:49.219 --> 54:50.738
You can't go.

54:50.773 --> 54:52.395
I've really got
to get this train.

54:52.430 --> 54:53.879
I mean, you can't...

54:54.984 --> 54:55.985
You know...

54:58.436 --> 55:00.058
You can't do that,
because it's not fair.

55:05.373 --> 55:06.513
It's not fair.

55:06.961 --> 55:08.066
Here, come on.

55:18.663 --> 55:20.906
It's not fair on the
ones that you leave behind.

55:58.461 --> 55:59.669
It's Liusaidh.

56:02.258 --> 56:03.535
Liusaidh?

56:12.855 --> 56:13.752
I'm Dale.

56:35.325 --> 56:37.742
Well, she liked to walk.

56:37.776 --> 56:39.778
She would come home
with the weekly shopping

56:39.813 --> 56:42.194
and her hands would be red-raw.

56:42.229 --> 56:45.232
She'd walk all the way home
through the tunnel,

56:45.266 --> 56:49.408
and come in looking happy
in spite of being dog tired.

56:50.927 --> 56:53.723
I didn't think much
of it at the time.

56:53.758 --> 56:55.622
I used to watch her
rub hand cream.

56:55.656 --> 56:59.453
She always had this cream next
to her chair in the living room.

56:59.487 --> 57:03.595
She'd rub this cream and soothe
the dry bits on her palms

57:03.630 --> 57:06.218
from the plastic bags.

57:06.253 --> 57:09.739
Ah! I shouldn't have
let her walk like that.

57:09.774 --> 57:12.190
Every time I think about it,
it...

57:13.156 --> 57:14.882
It breaks my heart.

57:17.885 --> 57:19.577
Could you
have saved her?

57:19.611 --> 57:21.199
No.

57:21.233 --> 57:22.994
She was taken from me.

57:24.443 --> 57:27.170
Good. It's easier.

57:31.174 --> 57:33.625
It's too crowded. I'm sick of the
clutter in this fucking house.

57:33.660 --> 57:35.178
I want rid of it.

57:35.213 --> 57:36.145
I'll sort that out.

57:36.179 --> 57:38.596
Oh, aye, aye.
I've heard it all before.

57:38.630 --> 57:40.390
I want rid of it.
She never plays it.

57:40.425 --> 57:41.633
I did try to once.

57:41.668 --> 57:42.772
We need the space.

57:42.807 --> 57:45.050
Do you remember
what you did?

57:45.085 --> 57:46.431
You don't even...

57:46.465 --> 57:47.708
What do we
need the space for, eh?

57:47.743 --> 57:49.158
Space to use.

57:51.988 --> 57:53.507
That's too loud.

57:53.541 --> 57:55.026
Turn that down, missy.

58:23.779 --> 58:25.228
I can help you.

58:33.340 --> 58:35.307
Hi.Hi. Eh...

58:37.482 --> 58:38.725
Could you step this way?

58:38.759 --> 58:40.381
I would love to, but
actually I've got to work.

58:40.416 --> 58:42.694
No, just for two seconds. I need to
have a quick word with you, Liusaidh.

58:42.729 --> 58:44.420
These are all
out of order.

58:44.454 --> 58:46.767
Please don't sack me.

58:46.802 --> 58:48.735
Come on, please...
Please don't sack me.

58:51.703 --> 58:53.256
There's nothing I can do.

58:54.568 --> 58:55.707
I mean,
you've got to understand

58:55.742 --> 58:57.847
you were off work
for five days in a row.

58:57.882 --> 59:00.160
I mean,
you didn't come in once.

59:00.194 --> 59:01.955
I'm sor... Shut up!
I don't give a fuck!

59:01.989 --> 59:03.991
I don't get paid
to give a fuck.

59:04.026 --> 59:05.165
Okay.
I mean, I can see...

59:05.199 --> 59:06.856
I can understand
that you're angry.

59:06.891 --> 59:08.306
But I'm gonna have to
let you go.

59:08.340 --> 59:09.307
No, no, no, no.

59:09.341 --> 59:10.584
No. No, no.

59:10.618 --> 59:11.723
No, no, no, no.

59:11.965 --> 59:12.897
No.

59:14.208 --> 59:15.313
No.

59:17.246 --> 59:18.419
Uh...

59:21.768 --> 59:23.355
I'm sorry.
I wish there was something I could do.

59:24.184 --> 59:26.255
Why are you so happy
all the time?

59:28.706 --> 59:30.328
What?

59:30.362 --> 59:32.468
Like, why is it that every time I look
over at you from the cheese counter,

59:32.502 --> 59:33.745
you're smiling?

59:35.816 --> 59:37.576
Uh... I don't know.

59:37.611 --> 59:39.613
I have a good life. Stop smiling

59:39.647 --> 59:41.063
because you don't have
a good life.

59:41.097 --> 59:43.237
You work in a supermarket
with your mam.

59:44.480 --> 59:45.826
Yeah, well, I'm...

59:45.861 --> 59:47.276
I mean,
I'm lucky to have a job.

59:47.310 --> 59:49.278
There's lots of people at the
moment that don't, so...

59:49.934 --> 59:51.142
Can you suffer then?

59:51.176 --> 59:53.040
What do you mean? Stop smiling.

59:54.352 --> 59:55.767
Stop smiling. I'm not.

59:55.802 --> 59:56.975
You are. I'm not smiling.

59:57.010 --> 59:58.805
Stop it. I'm not smiling. I'm not.

01:00:00.772 --> 01:00:01.946
This is shit.

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:04.327
This is shit.

01:00:04.362 --> 01:00:06.019
No, it's not shit.

01:00:08.228 --> 01:00:09.367
Fuck you,

01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:11.300
and fuck the cheese!

01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:15.718
Do you
have any mortadella?

01:00:15.753 --> 01:00:18.410
We don't
fucking stock mortadella!

01:00:18.445 --> 01:00:21.551
I'm starting to get these weird
bits of fat at the top of my legs.

01:00:21.586 --> 01:00:22.587
At the back.

01:00:22.621 --> 01:00:23.864
It's horrible.

01:00:23.899 --> 01:00:26.729
It's like foreign bodies,
like, living under my arse.

01:00:26.764 --> 01:00:27.868
Is it really
bothering you?

01:00:27.903 --> 01:00:29.870
Yeah, it looks all
warped and deformed.

01:00:29.905 --> 01:00:31.251
Does Ryan mind?

01:00:31.285 --> 01:00:32.631
He hasn't mentioned it.

01:00:32.666 --> 01:00:33.771
Then why do you mind?

01:00:33.805 --> 01:00:35.220
It's not about him,
it's about me.

01:00:35.255 --> 01:00:36.049
No.

01:00:36.083 --> 01:00:37.602
You want to look good
for him.

01:00:37.636 --> 01:00:40.605
You dress up for him, you do
this shit to your nails for him.

01:00:40.639 --> 01:00:41.606
You dress up, too.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.572
Yeah, but not for a man.

01:00:42.607 --> 01:00:44.022
No. For lots of men.

01:00:46.818 --> 01:00:48.302
Uh-huh.

01:00:48.337 --> 01:00:50.028
So less judgement on me.

01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:53.342
Look, you're worrying
about your weight,

01:00:53.376 --> 01:00:54.792
because you want
to have kids with Ryan

01:00:54.826 --> 01:00:56.552
and keep him around
to help you raise them.

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:58.726
Where does this even come from?
Ryan doesn't want more kids.
We're past that now.

01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:00.625
But are you?
Those kids aren't yours.

01:01:00.659 --> 01:01:02.351
I take care of them
like they're mine.

01:01:03.041 --> 01:01:05.043
Don't you want
something more?

01:01:06.286 --> 01:01:07.252
Something?

01:01:20.403 --> 01:01:21.370
Donna...

01:01:23.406 --> 01:01:24.925
This...

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.582
It's coming up
for a year now.

01:01:29.827 --> 01:01:31.104
Donna, can I have...

01:01:31.138 --> 01:01:32.899
You're not allowed in here.
Out!

01:01:32.933 --> 01:01:34.245
I hate you, Donna.

01:01:34.935 --> 01:01:36.316
Should I try the shellac?

01:01:41.217 --> 01:01:42.218
Hello?

01:01:42.943 --> 01:01:44.220
Earth to Liusaidh.

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:52.125
What the fuck is shellac?

01:01:52.159 --> 01:01:54.644
It's a gel that stays on
for a few weeks.

01:01:54.679 --> 01:01:55.818
But it's hard to get off.

01:01:55.853 --> 01:01:57.958
You have to soak your nails
in acetone,

01:01:57.993 --> 01:02:01.237
and then, cover your nails
with pads and tinfoil.

01:02:53.048 --> 01:02:55.636
Do you fancy going uptown?
Doing a wee bit of shopping?

01:02:57.673 --> 01:02:59.709
Ach, I don't know.

01:02:59.744 --> 01:03:01.746
We need some quality time,
you and me.

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.161
It'll be good.

01:03:06.509 --> 01:03:07.959
I like it.

01:03:07.994 --> 01:03:08.960
What do you think?

01:03:08.995 --> 01:03:10.582
I think it's sensational.

01:03:14.862 --> 01:03:16.209
I think I'll go for it.

01:03:16.243 --> 01:03:18.280
What, are you
getting it now? Yes.

01:03:18.936 --> 01:03:20.282
Come here.

01:03:22.525 --> 01:03:24.182
Come here.Okay.

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:26.909
So, I'm going to need you
to take it out in your name.

01:03:26.944 --> 01:03:28.186
Um, why?

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:30.326
Because I got too much stuff
on credit under my name.

01:03:30.361 --> 01:03:31.949
But I don't want
the debt for this thing.

01:03:31.983 --> 01:03:34.710
Look, I'll pay for it. I just need
your name to get it on credit.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:35.987
But you've already
got too much stuff,

01:03:36.022 --> 01:03:37.609
so how are you gonna
pay for this?

01:03:39.266 --> 01:03:41.130
My name is blacklisted.
All right?

01:03:41.165 --> 01:03:43.374
I can't get anything on credit
from any shops anymore.

01:03:43.408 --> 01:03:45.410
So I really need you
to put your name on this

01:03:45.445 --> 01:03:47.240
and I will pay it off
straightaway.

01:03:47.274 --> 01:03:49.207
Why'd you even need
a new couch?

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:51.347
Because I've got some of
the girls coming round,

01:03:51.382 --> 01:03:53.108
and I wanted
the place nice.

01:03:54.143 --> 01:03:55.973
You sound just like
your father.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.631
But he wasn't complaining when I
got him his flat-screen telly.

01:03:59.666 --> 01:04:01.944
Why'd you care so much
about what those ladies think?

01:04:01.979 --> 01:04:04.257
You know what?
You're a social climber.

01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:06.086
You never grew up
in a one-bed shithole

01:04:06.121 --> 01:04:08.261
with seven other kids
and an outdoor toilet.

01:04:09.089 --> 01:04:10.746
Because I made sure
of that.

01:04:16.959 --> 01:04:18.685
Is that why you only
had one child?

01:04:23.207 --> 01:04:25.105
I wish you didn't
do that to me.

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.693
Excuse me? I can't...

01:04:27.521 --> 01:04:29.040
Talk to anyone.

01:04:30.421 --> 01:04:33.251
You can talk to me. No,
I can't talk to you.

01:04:35.495 --> 01:04:39.016
Look, let's just get this
back to the house

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:42.088
and we'll sit back down
and natter all night.

01:04:45.125 --> 01:04:49.267
And your father is
on a need-to-know basis.

01:04:51.028 --> 01:04:52.305
Come on. Of course.

01:05:14.741 --> 01:05:16.294
Hello.
How are you today?

01:05:19.884 --> 01:05:20.850
Uh...

01:05:20.885 --> 01:05:22.266
Not bad. Yourself?

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.716
We're in the area
to discuss the Bible with you.

01:05:24.751 --> 01:05:26.718
With all the terrible events
going on in the world,

01:05:26.753 --> 01:05:29.135
a lot of people are questioning
whether God exists,

01:05:29.169 --> 01:05:31.240
or cares about
the human race.

01:05:31.275 --> 01:05:32.621
Would you agree with this?

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.288
Fuck.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.226
Making me do
something that's...

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.229
That's wrong.

01:05:56.886 --> 01:06:00.200
They're brainwashing you.
They'll make you fucking crazy.

01:06:00.235 --> 01:06:01.719
I'm sorry.

01:06:04.031 --> 01:06:05.550
Well, they've put you back
on the Prozac,

01:06:05.585 --> 01:06:07.759
because I can see it
in your eyes.

01:06:15.112 --> 01:06:17.183
Don't go back to
the church, please.

01:06:19.633 --> 01:06:20.841
Please don't leave me.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:23.879
Get off me.

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:24.983
I fucking need you.

01:06:25.018 --> 01:06:26.744
Just get the fuck
off me.

01:06:26.778 --> 01:06:27.814
Please.

01:06:33.992 --> 01:06:35.166
Look at you.

01:06:37.651 --> 01:06:39.688
I don't even know
what you are anymore.

01:06:42.863 --> 01:06:44.175
You're a freak.

01:06:51.009 --> 01:06:53.495
You're manipulating me into
committing a sin with you,

01:06:53.529 --> 01:06:55.462
because you don't want
to be alone in it.

01:06:58.224 --> 01:07:00.226
And you don't have
anyone to save you.

01:07:04.506 --> 01:07:07.957
No, I'm loving you.

01:07:10.063 --> 01:07:12.169
And I'm asking you
to love me back,

01:07:12.203 --> 01:07:13.756
and maybe we can be happy.

01:07:20.107 --> 01:07:21.454
Because I love you.

01:07:26.735 --> 01:07:27.943
I forgive you.

01:07:44.925 --> 01:07:48.412
In the afterlife, we
can offer you paradise on Earth.

01:07:49.378 --> 01:07:51.104
That is for you to keep,

01:07:51.138 --> 01:07:54.383
and inside the leaflet is all
the details of the church.

01:07:54.418 --> 01:07:56.247
If you could give it a read,
we'd be very grateful,

01:07:56.282 --> 01:08:00.769
and maybe we could come back round
next week and hear your thoughts.

01:08:05.774 --> 01:08:08.328
Okay. Well,
thank you for your time.

01:08:40.705 --> 01:08:41.810
That's not true.

01:08:43.363 --> 01:08:44.571
You've got me.

01:09:49.395 --> 01:09:51.707
Oh, is that what it is?

01:09:51.742 --> 01:09:53.087
Holds the shape
of your boots.

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.952
Like a shoe tree,
but for boots.

01:09:55.366 --> 01:09:56.609
Right enough.

01:09:56.643 --> 01:09:59.681
Liusaidh, you're looking
a wee bit puffy at the moment.

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:01.717
What?

01:10:01.752 --> 01:10:05.618
The bags under your eyes
are starting to dominate.

01:10:06.895 --> 01:10:08.241
Dominate?

01:10:08.275 --> 01:10:12.210
I've got an amazing cream that
would help those tremendously.

01:10:12.245 --> 01:10:14.109
The eye cream off
the shopping channel.

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:15.628
Aye. It's taken
years off me.

01:10:15.662 --> 01:10:17.112
It could do the same
for you.

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:18.078
No, thanks.

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:19.390
My pleasure.

01:10:19.425 --> 01:10:20.805
I'll send some over
with Susan.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.498
You won't get a boyfriend
like that,

01:10:23.532 --> 01:10:26.155
hiding behind those things.

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:38.435
Come on, come on.

01:11:42.508 --> 01:11:44.958
She is fucking
wasted, man.

01:11:44.993 --> 01:11:46.235
Fuck off.

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:48.306
What the fuck you doing?

01:11:48.341 --> 01:11:52.172
Stay there. Stay there.

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:53.657
What are you doing?

01:11:55.693 --> 01:11:57.454
Oh, my God.
Is that water?

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.637
Come on, get her up.

01:12:09.983 --> 01:12:12.572
Get comfy. You got any music?

01:12:13.021 --> 01:12:14.056
Who are you?

01:12:14.091 --> 01:12:16.024
Your lover. Yeah?

01:12:16.058 --> 01:12:17.957
Whoo!

01:12:18.716 --> 01:12:19.821
Whoa.

01:12:22.513 --> 01:12:24.239
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:26.517
Oh, oh. Oh, no!

01:12:26.552 --> 01:12:27.863
Oh, she spits.

01:12:27.898 --> 01:12:30.590
Lie down.
Party's just beginning.

01:12:30.625 --> 01:12:32.523
Party's just beginning.

01:12:39.668 --> 01:12:41.912
She came on to me
though, didn't she?

01:12:41.946 --> 01:12:43.223
She wanted this.

01:12:52.129 --> 01:12:53.475
You want it, don't you?

01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:56.374
Yeah? Yeah. That's it.

01:12:56.409 --> 01:12:58.515
Remember me?
Remember me from the club?

01:12:59.101 --> 01:13:00.551
Remember me?

01:13:06.108 --> 01:13:07.558
Come on, man.

01:13:12.425 --> 01:13:14.772
Yeah.
Yeah, get on there.

01:15:23.729 --> 01:15:25.523
Merry Christmas.

01:15:25.558 --> 01:15:27.284
Merry Christmas.

01:15:27.318 --> 01:15:29.217
I did what you said.

01:15:29.251 --> 01:15:30.977
I invited the kids over.

01:15:31.012 --> 01:15:33.393
Did you? Aye, I did.

01:15:33.428 --> 01:15:35.464
Was it nice
to see the grandkids?

01:15:35.499 --> 01:15:39.089
It was nice having a bit
of life running about the house.

01:15:40.677 --> 01:15:43.921
The eldest is very musical.
I didn't know that.

01:15:45.164 --> 01:15:47.891
I have an old piano, and
he was straight on it.

01:15:47.925 --> 01:15:50.203
Playing all the songs he'd been learning.

01:15:50.238 --> 01:15:52.723
Oh, aye. He had me singing along.

01:15:52.758 --> 01:15:54.932
It takes something, I'm telling you.

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:58.211
My
granddad used to have an organ.

01:15:58.246 --> 01:16:00.041
I used to play it
when I was a wee kid.

01:16:00.075 --> 01:16:03.009
Well, I say playing, but I was
probably like bashing on the keys.

01:16:03.044 --> 01:16:05.529
And then, my dad bought this
old out of tune piano.

01:16:05.563 --> 01:16:08.325
And he always said that he was gonna
play it, and then, he never did.

01:16:08.359 --> 01:16:13.330
So, I would, like, sneak up
there and start playing it.

01:16:14.572 --> 01:16:15.850
And I loved it.

01:16:19.301 --> 01:16:22.580
Me and my mate, we used to
do karaoke all the time.

01:16:22.615 --> 01:16:24.168
And we always had this...

01:16:24.203 --> 01:16:26.584
We always said that
we would move to California

01:16:26.619 --> 01:16:29.277
and get really suntanned,

01:16:29.311 --> 01:16:33.315
and I was gonna make all the money at
night playing the piano in nightclubs,

01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:35.076
and then, he was gonna
come down and sing.

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:38.217
And then we'd have enough
money to live in the warm.

01:16:39.632 --> 01:16:40.978
It would have been good.

01:16:41.841 --> 01:16:43.809
It sounds great, actually.

01:16:43.843 --> 01:16:45.949
Did you have a nice Christmas?

01:16:49.262 --> 01:16:51.264
Well, I went to sleep
with three random guys

01:16:51.299 --> 01:16:53.301
and then woke up covered
in bruises and love bites.

01:16:53.335 --> 01:16:55.130
But my mum didn't
burn the turkey... What?

01:16:55.165 --> 01:16:57.615
So you win some,
you lose some. What happened?

01:16:57.650 --> 01:16:59.169
I don't know.
I blacked out.

01:16:59.203 --> 01:17:02.724
Well, do you think you might
have been raped, Charlotte?

01:17:05.727 --> 01:17:07.073
No, no.
I chose to go.

01:17:07.108 --> 01:17:09.731
Why do you think you chose to go with them?

01:17:09.766 --> 01:17:11.008
I don't know.

01:17:11.768 --> 01:17:12.872
I don't fucking know.

01:17:14.115 --> 01:17:15.702
Well, I mean,
I wasn't even there.

01:17:15.737 --> 01:17:17.290
I mean, I was.
I was laying in the bed.

01:17:17.325 --> 01:17:18.809
But, like, I wasn't.

01:17:18.844 --> 01:17:21.467
Because I was in a different
drunken dimension

01:17:21.501 --> 01:17:22.571
dreaming myself away.

01:17:22.606 --> 01:17:24.953
Well, it's time to wake up now.

01:17:29.647 --> 01:17:31.132
I wasn't always like this.

01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:34.307
You're only at the beginning.

01:17:35.757 --> 01:17:37.483
It's all to come.

01:17:39.899 --> 01:17:41.349
Was it worth it?

01:17:41.383 --> 01:17:43.316
Like... Like...

01:17:44.490 --> 01:17:45.905
Was it worth it?

01:17:47.182 --> 01:17:50.807
I still set a place for Edith at the table.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.189
Well, if I didn't do that,

01:17:54.224 --> 01:17:58.297
it would be like she
disappeared without a trace.

01:18:00.678 --> 01:18:02.266
Edith...

01:18:02.301 --> 01:18:04.165
What? Are you there, Edith?

01:18:08.721 --> 01:18:10.205
I'm tired.

01:18:14.727 --> 01:18:15.935
I love you.

01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:17.316
I love you, too.

01:18:21.561 --> 01:18:23.943
Time to go to sleep now.

01:19:21.967 --> 01:19:24.003
Oh, I...

01:19:27.834 --> 01:19:29.112
I...

01:19:37.568 --> 01:19:38.431
Hey...

01:22:53.523 --> 01:22:54.938
It's so cold.

01:22:54.972 --> 01:22:56.526
I know.
It's fucking freezing.

01:23:41.364 --> 01:23:42.779
Fuck you.

01:23:45.506 --> 01:23:47.370
Fuck you for doing that to me.

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:51.581
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:56.172
Okay.

01:24:00.037 --> 01:24:00.900
Okay.

01:24:01.798 --> 01:24:02.902
Enough.

01:25:50.838 --> 01:25:51.735
Hello?

01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:53.461
How was the ceremony?

01:25:53.496 --> 01:25:55.843
What? Alistair's ceremony.

01:26:02.505 --> 01:26:03.851
Why are you asking that?

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:07.337
Because I never went.

01:26:09.305 --> 01:26:10.616
It was nice.

01:26:12.308 --> 01:26:13.723
Proper religious, though.

01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:20.350
Do you wanna go out and
just get fucking smashed?

01:26:20.385 --> 01:26:21.731
Yeah.

01:26:23.249 --> 01:26:24.423
Will you do my nails?

01:26:24.458 --> 01:26:26.149
Fucking finally.

01:26:28.324 --> 01:26:31.085
Great. Well, see you.
